He's boyfriendly?

12:47.157 --> 12:51.857
I don't understand why
you don't want me to have this.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.513
I mean, boys don't chase me
around all the time.

12:55.557 --> 12:56.687
I thought
you'd be happy for me.

12:56.731 --> 12:58.995
I just want
you to be sure.

12:59.038 --> 13:01.171
To meet him
face-to-face...

13:01.215 --> 13:05.000
in daylight, in a crowded
place with some friends.

13:05.044 --> 13:09.178
You know, before you
become all obsessive.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.835
Malcolm and I
really care about each other.

13:12.879 --> 13:16.796
Big deal if I blow off
a couple classes.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.450
I thought you said
you overslept?

13:19.494 --> 13:23.366
Malcolm said
you wouldn't understand.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.370
Malcolm was right.

13:35.030 --> 13:36.859
Dave?

13:36.903 --> 13:38.991
[keyboard clacking]

13:39.034 --> 13:41.081
Hi there, Dave.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.431
Anybody home?
[gasps]

13:43.474 --> 13:44.866
Oh. What do you want?

13:44.911 --> 13:46.476
I wanted to ask you
something,

13:46.520 --> 13:48.217
if you have a minute.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.567
What is it?

13:49.610 --> 13:52.395
Well, you're
a computer geek-- genius--

13:52.440 --> 13:55.399
and, uh, I sort of have
a technical problem.

13:55.442 --> 13:57.009
If I wanted to find out
something about someone--

13:57.052 --> 14:00.230
if someone e-mailed me--
could I trace the letter?

14:01.710 --> 14:03.885
Well, you could pull up
somebody's profile

14:03.929 --> 14:05.975
based on their user name.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.325
But they write the profile
themselves, right?

14:08.369 --> 14:10.240
I mean, so they can say
anything they wanted.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.850
True.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.808
Wow, I had knowledge.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.812
Well, is there a way
to find out exactly

14:16.855 --> 14:19.162
where a letter--
an e-letter-- came from?

14:19.206 --> 14:21.424
I mean the actual location
of the computer.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.167
It's a challenge.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.951
'Cause, you see, Willow's
got this boyfriend Malcolm,

14:25.995 --> 14:27.213
and to tell you
the truth...

14:27.256 --> 14:28.998
Leave Willow alone.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.695
What do you mean?

14:30.739 --> 14:33.001
That's none of your business.

14:34.611 --> 14:36.527
Dave, are you Malcolm?

14:36.571 --> 14:38.225
Of course not.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.661
[keyboard clacking]

14:39.703 --> 14:41.270
Dave, what's going on?

14:41.315 --> 14:44.447
Look, I'll talk to you later,
okay?

14:44.491 --> 14:46.450
I've got work to do.

14:50.149 --> 14:51.368
[sighs]

14:51.412 --> 14:53.413
So do I.

14:57.634 --> 14:58.809
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.246
It's not just Willow.

15:00.289 --> 15:02.249
Dave, Fritz--
they're all wicked jumpy.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.990
Those boys aren't
sparklingly normal as it is.

15:05.033 --> 15:06.383
Giles, trust me.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.644
I do.

15:07.688 --> 15:09.908
I-I really don't know
how to advise you.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.955
Things involving the computer
fill me with a childlike terror.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.217
Now, if it were a nice ogre
or some such,

15:15.261 --> 15:17.003
I'd be more in my element.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.962
Well, I-I suppose you could,
uh, tail Dave,

15:21.006 --> 15:22.791
see if he's up to something.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.445
Follow Dave?

15:24.488 --> 15:27.230
What, in dark glasses
and a trench coat? Please.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.754
I can work this out myself.

15:29.798 --> 15:32.192
[bell ringing]

15:36.022 --> 15:38.633
[engine starts]

15:38.676 --> 15:41.027
[car driving away]

15:56.302 --> 15:58.304
[car door closes]

16:02.221 --> 16:04.964
[no audio]

16:15.756 --> 16:17.976
[whirring]

16:18.019 --> 16:20.500
[beeping]

16:27.769 --> 16:29.596
She's too close.

16:29.639 --> 16:31.380
What do I do?

16:37.735 --> 16:39.736
Party.

16:44.220 --> 16:47.528
[indistinct conversations]

16:47.571 --> 16:49.572
BUFFY:
Whatever Dave is into,
it's large.

16:49.616 --> 16:51.096
What was the name
of this place?

16:51.139 --> 16:52.793
It said C.R.D.

16:52.836 --> 16:55.404
But I couldn't get close enough
to see what it was.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.407
Calax Research and Development.
It's a computer research lab.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.668
Third largest employer
in Sunnydale,

16:58.712 --> 16:59.888
till it closed down last year.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.892
What, I can't have
information sometimes?

17:03.934 --> 17:06.634
It's just somewhat
unprecedented.

17:06.675 --> 17:08.416
Well, my uncle
used to work there...

17:08.461 --> 17:10.768
in a floor-sweeping capacity.

17:10.810 --> 17:12.335
But it closed?
Uh-huh.

17:12.377 --> 17:14.336
Looked pretty functional
from where I stood.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.861
I don't have a clue
what they were doing.

17:16.904 --> 17:18.776
And what do they need Dave for?

17:18.819 --> 17:20.646
Something about
computers, right?

17:20.691 --> 17:23.564
I mean, he is
off-the-charts smart.

17:23.606 --> 17:26.000
We still don't know
an enormous amount.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.090
Whatever is going on there
may be on the up and up.

17:29.134 --> 17:31.093
No. If C.R.D. opened,
it would have been on the news.

17:31.136 --> 17:32.573
Besides, I can just
tell something's wrong.

17:32.615 --> 17:34.965
My spider sense
is tingling.

17:35.009 --> 17:37.098
Your spider sense?

17:37.143 --> 17:39.101
Pop-culture reference.
Sorry.

17:39.144 --> 17:40.450
Yes, well, [clears throat]

17:40.493 --> 17:42.060
I think we're still
at a standstill.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.278
Short of breaking into
the place, I don't see...

17:43.323 --> 17:44.888
Breaking in.
Then this is the plan.

17:44.932 --> 17:47.108
I'm free tonight.Tonight it is.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.546
A moment, please,
of quiet reflection.

17:49.589 --> 17:53.201
I did not suggest that
you illegally enter the...

17:53.246 --> 17:55.161
[clears throat]
...data into the file

17:55.203 --> 17:57.771
so the book will be listed
by title as well as author.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.471
I just came by to check
your new database,

18:01.515 --> 18:04.170
make sure your cross-reference
table isn't glitching.

18:04.212 --> 18:06.388
'Cause I'm guessing you haven't
gone anywhere near it.

18:06.432 --> 18:09.174
I'm still sorting through
the chaos you left behind you.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.001
Hmm.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.700
You're here again?

18:12.742 --> 18:14.441
You kids really dig
the library, don't you?

18:14.483 --> 18:16.529
We're literary.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.880
Uh, to read makes
our speaking English good.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.708
We'll be going now.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.971
Uh, well, we'll continue this
conversation at another time.

18:23.013 --> 18:24.406
I think we're done.

18:24.451 --> 18:25.930
Makes our speaking
English good?

18:25.973 --> 18:27.714
I panicked, okay?

18:27.758 --> 18:29.238
MALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
I've never felt this way

18:29.281 --> 18:32.459
about anyone before, Willow.

18:32.501 --> 18:35.766
[keyboard clacking]I know what you mean.

18:35.809 --> 18:39.943
I feel like you know me
better than anyone.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.555
I do.

18:41.597 --> 18:45.906
Do you think
we should... meet?

18:45.950 --> 18:47.734
I think we should soon.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.693
I'm nervous.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.306
I'm not. Isn't that strange?

18:53.348 --> 18:56.134
That's what Buffy
doesn't understand--

18:56.177 --> 18:59.876
how comfortable
you can make me feel.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.619
Buffy just makes trouble.

19:03.663 --> 19:07.276
That's why she got kicked out
of her old school.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.194
How did you know that?

19:13.239 --> 19:16.154
It's on her permanent record.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.507
You must have mentioned it.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.512
I guess.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.471
Let's not worry about her
anymore.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.257
I have to sign off.

19:31.299 --> 19:34.173
I'll talk to you later.

19:34.868 --> 19:37.175
Don't.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.442
You're a snob.

19:42.484 --> 19:43.877
I am no such thing.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.444
Oh, you are a big snob.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.185
I mean,
y-you think that knowledge

19:47.229 --> 19:49.536
should be kept in these
carefully guarded repositories

19:49.578 --> 19:52.103
where only a handful
of white guys can get at it.

19:52.146 --> 19:53.670
Nonsense.

19:53.713 --> 19:55.846
I simply don't adhere
to a knee-jerk assumption

19:55.890 --> 19:58.674
that because something is new
it's better.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.286
This isn't a fad, Rupert.

20:00.328 --> 20:02.243
We are creating
a new society here.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.680
A society in which
human interaction

20:03.723 --> 20:05.942
is all but obsolete,
in which people

20:05.987 --> 20:07.554
can be completely
manipulated by technology.

20:07.596 --> 20:09.382
Well-well,

20:09.424 --> 20:10.948
thank you, I'll pass.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.125
Well, I think
you'll be very happy here

20:15.170 --> 20:17.651
with your musty old books.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.087
These musty old books

20:20.131 --> 20:21.480
have a great deal more to say

20:21.523 --> 20:24.134
than any of your
fabulous Web pages.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.007
Hmm.

20:26.049 --> 20:29.096
This one doesn't have
a whole lot more to say.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.796
What is it,
like a diary?

20:34.232 --> 20:36.409
How odd.

20:36.451 --> 20:38.846
I haven't looked through
all the volumes yet.

20:38.888 --> 20:40.239
I didn't, um...

20:43.153 --> 20:44.547
What is it?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.724
Uh, nothing.
Um, a diary, yes.

20:48.769 --> 20:52.032
I imagine that's what it is.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.949
Well, it's been so nice
talking to you.

20:54.991 --> 20:57.125
We were fighting.

20:57.167 --> 20:59.910
Must do it again sometime.

20:59.953 --> 21:01.955
Bye now.

21:03.826 --> 21:06.002
I checked the computer,
and there's nothing in his file

21:06.047 --> 21:07.788
about being allergic
to penicillin.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.049
DAVE:
Buffy.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.703
Dave. How you doing?

21:10.747 --> 21:12.314
Okay.

21:12.357 --> 21:13.968
Look, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

21:14.010 --> 21:15.751
I haven't been getting
much sleep lately, you know?

21:15.796 --> 21:18.145
Don't sweat it.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.061
Willow was looking for you.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.628
Good. I need to talk to her.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.152
Do you know where she is?

21:25.674 --> 21:27.460
She said she'd be in the...
in the girl's locker room.

21:27.502 --> 21:28.982
Great.

21:29.026 --> 21:30.767
Thanks.

21:37.121 --> 21:38.688
Will?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.480
Willow?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.838
[shower running]Will?

21:58.882 --> 22:00.753
Are you taking a shower?

22:04.365 --> 22:05.801
I guess not.

22:13.983 --> 22:15.463
This is how droughts
get started.

22:18.075 --> 22:21.035
Buffy, get out!

22:21.775 --> 22:23.211
[crackling]

22:23.253 --> 22:24.517
[yells]

22:24.559 --> 22:26.736
[grunts]

22:42.838 --> 22:44.798
I can't do it.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.322
I'm not gonna do it.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.324
MALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
But you promised.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.021
Buffy isn't a threat to you!

22:52.066 --> 22:53.894
It's not worth it.

22:53.936 --> 22:56.330
The project is almost complete.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.202
You won't have to do it again.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.990
Oh, I can't.

23:03.032 --> 23:05.513
I've shown you
a new world, Dave.

23:05.557 --> 23:07.429
Knowledge, power...

23:07.472 --> 23:09.170
I can give you everything.

23:09.212 --> 23:11.259
All I want is your love.

23:11.301 --> 23:13.304
No.

23:13.347 --> 23:14.914
This isn't right.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.786
None of it is.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.224
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
I'm sorry.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.617
I've been a terrible person.

23:22.662 --> 23:27.362
I'm a coward, and I can't go on
living like this.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.583
Forgive me, Mom and Dad.

23:30.625 --> 23:34.020
At least now,
I'll have some peace.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.109
Remember me.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.416
Love, Dave.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.728
I'm gonna kill Dave.

23:45.771 --> 23:47.382
He tried to warn me.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.339
Warn you that
he set you up?

23:49.384 --> 23:50.777
Is she going to be okay?

23:50.819 --> 23:52.473
She was only grounded
for a moment.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.607
Still, if you'd been
anyone but the slayer...

23:56.869 --> 23:58.306
Tell me the truth.

23:58.348 --> 24:00.047
How's my hair?

24:00.089 --> 24:02.919
It's great.
It's your best hair ever.

24:02.962 --> 24:04.486
Uh, uh, yes.

24:04.529 --> 24:06.531
I just...

24:06.575 --> 24:08.229
I don't understand
what would make Dave

24:08.271 --> 24:10.404
do a thing like that.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.319
I think perhaps I do.

24:17.193 --> 24:19.848
Does this look familiar
to either of you?

24:19.893 --> 24:22.503
Yeah, sure.
It looks like a book.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.114
I knew that one.

24:24.157 --> 24:26.813
In the Dark Ages,
the souls of demons

24:26.855 --> 24:28.554
were sometimes trapped
in certain volumes.

24:28.596 --> 24:31.773
