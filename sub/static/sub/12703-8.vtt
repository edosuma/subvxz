00:01.479 --> 00:03.394
In every generation
there is a chosen one.

00:03.438 --> 00:06.049
She alone will stand
against the vampires,

00:06.092 --> 00:08.833
the demons
and the forces of darkness.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.880
She is the slayer.

02:29.844 --> 02:31.802
Oh, great. A book.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.939
Oh, I, uh, haven't gone through
the new arrivals.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.072
Uh, put it in, uh,
in-in that pile.

02:40.115 --> 02:41.290
Here, I'll get it.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.683
Oh, thanks, Dave.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.425
Willow pile.

02:44.468 --> 02:48.646
Uh, uh, when I've examined it,
you can, uh, uh, skim it.

02:48.689 --> 02:49.995
Scan it.

02:50.038 --> 02:51.997
Rupert, that's scan it.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.608
Of course.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.783
Oh, I know our ways
are strange to you,

02:55.826 --> 02:57.960
but soon you will join us
in the 20th century

02:58.002 --> 02:59.439
with three whole years
to spare.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.092
Ms. Calendar...

03:01.137 --> 03:03.792
I'm sure your computer
science class is fascinating,

03:03.835 --> 03:05.228
but I happen to believe
that one can survive

03:05.271 --> 03:06.968
in modern society
without being a slave

03:07.012 --> 03:09.449
to the, um, idiot box.

03:09.492 --> 03:11.756
That's TV.
The idiot box is TV.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.889
This is the good box.

03:13.931 --> 03:16.064
Well, I still prefer
a good book.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.022
The printed page is obsolete.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.937
Information
isn't bound up anymore.

03:19.981 --> 03:21.200
It's an entity.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.159
The only reality is virtual.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.294
If you're not jacked in,
you're not alive.

03:28.990 --> 03:31.036
Thank you, Fritz,

03:31.079 --> 03:33.256
for making us all sound
like crazy people.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.605
Fritz... Fritz comes
on a little strong,

03:35.650 --> 03:38.435
but he does
have a point.

03:38.478 --> 03:39.914
You know, for the
last two years,

03:39.957 --> 03:41.829
more e-mail was sent
than regular mail.
Hmm.

03:41.872 --> 03:43.310
More digitized information

03:43.353 --> 03:45.180
went across phone lines
than conversations.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.486
Yeah, well, that is a fact

03:46.530 --> 03:49.140
that I regard
with genuine horror.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.317
I'll bet it is.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.754
All right, guys,
let's wrap it up for today.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.800
I've just got a few more.
I'll hang for a bit.

03:55.843 --> 03:57.280
Cool. Thanks.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.151
Xander, you want
to stay and help me?

03:59.194 --> 04:00.848
[chuckles]
Are you kidding?

04:00.891 --> 04:03.764
Yes. It was a joke I made up.

04:03.807 --> 04:06.246
[chuckles]:
Willow, I love you,
but bye.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.463
See you tomorrow.

04:07.508 --> 04:08.986
XANDER:
Buffy, wait up.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.554
I-I'm just going to stay
and clean up a little.

04:10.598 --> 04:13.295
I'll, uh, I'll be back
in the Middle Ages.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.296
Did you ever leave?

04:24.088 --> 04:25.264

05:59.053 --> 06:03.014
Willow! Willow,
hey, wait up.

06:03.057 --> 06:04.841
Oh, Buffy.
I didn't even see you.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.975
Or hear me.
What was up last night?

06:07.017 --> 06:08.932
I tried your line,
like, a million times.

06:08.976 --> 06:11.588
Oh, I was...
I was talking.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.502
Talking to...?

06:13.547 --> 06:15.678
Okay, that's it. You have a
secret, and that's not allowed.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.550
Why not?

06:17.593 --> 06:20.161
'Cause there's a rule.

06:20.204 --> 06:23.033
Well, I sort of
met someone.

06:23.077 --> 06:24.557
I knew it. This is so important.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.036
When did you meet?

06:26.081 --> 06:27.822
Last week, after we did
the scanning project

06:27.865 --> 06:29.519
in the library.

06:29.562 --> 06:30.867
Does he go here?
What's his name?

06:30.911 --> 06:32.216
Have you kissed him?
What's he like?

06:32.261 --> 06:34.829
No, Malcolm, no,
and very nice.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.613
You are a thing of evil for not
telling me this right away.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.747
Well, I wasn't sure
there was anything to tell.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.966
But last night, oh!

06:42.009 --> 06:44.577
We talked all night.
It was amazing.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.362
He's so smart, Buffy,

06:46.406 --> 06:50.192
and-and he's romantic,
and we agree about everything.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.194
Oh. What's he look like?

06:52.237 --> 06:53.716
I don't know.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.855
[keyboards clacking]

07:03.031 --> 07:05.206
Yes, I will.
I promise.

07:08.557 --> 07:10.386
So, you've been
seeing a guy,

07:10.430 --> 07:12.257
and you don't know
what he looks like.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.562
Okay, this is a puzzle.

07:13.606 --> 07:15.391
No, wait,
I'm good at these.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.959
Does it involve a midget
and a block of ice?

07:18.002 --> 07:19.612
I met him online.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.440
On-line for what?

07:22.528 --> 07:23.747
Oh.

07:23.790 --> 07:25.661
Good morning, kids.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.185
[keyboards clacking]

07:28.709 --> 07:30.362
Buffy, are you supposed
to be somewhere?

07:30.406 --> 07:32.408
No, I have a free.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.192
Cool. But this is lab time,

07:34.235 --> 07:36.281
so let's make it a nice,
short visit, okay?

07:36.324 --> 07:37.500
Sure.

07:37.543 --> 07:39.023
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
You have mail.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.417
It's him.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.678
[beeps]

07:44.550 --> 07:46.290
He's so sweet.

07:46.334 --> 07:47.509
He's a sweetie.

07:47.553 --> 07:49.860
What should I write back?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.949
Uh, Willow,
I think it's really great

07:52.994 --> 07:54.995
that you have
this cool pen pal,

07:55.038 --> 07:57.911
but don't you think you're kind
of rushing all into this?

07:57.954 --> 07:59.173
You know what I mean?

07:59.216 --> 08:01.350
"I'm thinking of you, too."

08:01.392 --> 08:04.178
No, that's incredibly
stupid.

08:04.221 --> 08:06.660
Will, down girl.
Let's focus here, okay?

08:06.702 --> 08:08.923
What do you actually
know about this guy?

08:08.966 --> 08:12.360
Oh, see, I knew you'd react
like this.

08:12.403 --> 08:13.579
Like what?

08:13.622 --> 08:15.538
I just want to make
sure you're careful,

08:15.581 --> 08:17.148
that's all.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.932
Buffy...

08:18.975 --> 08:20.891
He could be different
than you think.

08:23.153 --> 08:25.504
[chirping]

08:32.686 --> 08:35.340
[beeps]

08:54.184 --> 08:56.274
His name is Malcolm Black,
he's 18,

08:56.317 --> 08:58.581
lives in Elmwood, which is
about 80 miles from here,

08:58.625 --> 09:00.756
and he likes me.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.932
Short, tall,
skinny, fat?

09:02.976 --> 09:05.413
Why does everything
have to be about looks?

09:05.456 --> 09:09.025
Not everything,
but some stuff is.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.768
I mean, what if you guys get
really, really intense,

09:11.812 --> 09:16.033
and then you find out
that he has a hairy back?

09:16.076 --> 09:17.600
Well, no.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.471
He doesn't talk like somebody

09:19.514 --> 09:21.385
who would have
a hairy back.

09:21.429 --> 09:23.519
And anyways,
that stuff doesn't matter

09:23.562 --> 09:26.303
when you really
care about each other.

09:26.347 --> 09:29.524
Maybe I'm not
his ideal either.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.614
Hey, I'm just trying
to make sure

09:31.658 --> 09:32.962
that he's good enough
for you.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.661
I think it's great
that you met someone.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.490
Hey, Fritz...

09:39.534 --> 09:41.188
I'm, uh, looking
at the logs.

09:41.231 --> 09:42.451
You and Dave
are clocking

09:42.494 --> 09:44.626
a pretty scary amount
of computer time.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.149
New project.

09:46.193 --> 09:48.196
Ooh, will I be excited?

09:48.239 --> 09:49.544
You'll die.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.721
This isn't my report.

09:51.764 --> 09:55.289
"Nazi Germany was a model
of a well-ordered society"?

09:55.332 --> 09:57.161
I didn't write that.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.684
Who's been on my files?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.210
Eh, guess who?

10:02.253 --> 10:03.864
Uh, Xander?

10:03.907 --> 10:06.388
Yeah, but keep
guessing anyway.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.649
Xander.

10:07.693 --> 10:09.043
Oh, I can't fool you.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.522
You see right through
my petty charade.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.176
We going to the Bronze tonight?

10:12.220 --> 10:15.571
Not me. I think I'm going
to call it an early night.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.528
Oh, Malcolm, right?

10:17.572 --> 10:19.488
Yeah, I heard.

10:19.530 --> 10:20.880
But you're going
to be missing out.

10:20.923 --> 10:22.360
I'm planning to be witty--
I'm going to make fun

10:22.403 --> 10:23.927
of all the people
who won't talk to me.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.885
That's nice.
Have a good time.

10:25.928 --> 10:28.365
[bell ringing]

10:29.585 --> 10:31.195
She certainly
looks perky.

10:31.239 --> 10:34.850
Yeah, color in the cheeks,
bounce in the step.

10:34.894 --> 10:36.765
I don't like it.
It's not healthy.

10:36.809 --> 10:38.201
So, are you going
to the Bronze tonight?

10:38.245 --> 10:39.508
Well...
Oh, probably not.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.379
You probably have
some vampire slaying

10:41.423 --> 10:44.033
or some lame endeavor
like that, don't you?

10:44.077 --> 10:46.645
[scoffs]
Everyone deserts me.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.168
Check out
the jealous man.

10:48.211 --> 10:49.431
What are you
talking about?

10:49.474 --> 10:50.692
You're jealous.

10:50.736 --> 10:52.042
Of what?

10:52.086 --> 10:54.697
Willow's got a thang
and Xander's left hanging.

10:54.740 --> 10:56.567
Oh, that's
meaningless drivel.

10:56.611 --> 10:58.265
I'm not interested
in Willow like that.

10:58.308 --> 11:00.094
Yeah, but you got used
to being the belle of the ball.

11:00.136 --> 11:01.616
No, it's just
this Malcolm guy.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.096
What's his deal?

11:03.139 --> 11:05.664
I mean, tell me you're
not slightly wigged.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.230
Okay, slightly.

11:07.274 --> 11:09.364
I mean, just not knowing
what he's really like.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.931
Or who he really is?

11:10.974 --> 11:12.715
I mean, sure he says
he's a high school student,

11:12.759 --> 11:14.238
but I can say
I'm a high school student.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.543
You are.

11:15.586 --> 11:16.763
Okay, but I could also say

11:16.806 --> 11:18.590
that I'm an elderly
Dutch woman.

11:18.634 --> 11:19.940
Get me? I mean,
who's to say I'm not

11:19.982 --> 11:21.418
if I'm in the elderly
Dutch chat room.

11:21.462 --> 11:22.942
I get your point.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.772
I get your point.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.163
Oh, this guy could be anybody.

11:27.207 --> 11:30.645
He could be weird,
or crazy, or old,

11:30.690 --> 11:32.255
or he could be a circus freak.

11:32.299 --> 11:33.909
He's probably
a circus freak.

11:33.953 --> 11:35.216
Yeah, I mean,
we read about it all the time.

11:35.259 --> 11:36.696
You know,
people meet on the Net,

11:36.739 --> 11:38.436
they talk, they get together,
have dinner,

11:38.480 --> 11:40.787
a show, horrible ax murder.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.267
Willow ax-murdered
by a circus freak.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.965
Okay, okay, what do we do?

11:45.008 --> 11:46.836
What are we doing?

11:46.879 --> 11:49.011
Xander, you get me started.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.927
We are totally overreacting.

11:50.971 --> 11:53.190
But it's fun, isn't it?

11:55.539 --> 11:56.976
I'm jacked in.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.544
I'm jacked in.

12:01.807 --> 12:03.461
I'm jacked in.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.423
You're jacked in.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.817
[indistinct conversations]

12:16.605 --> 12:18.475
Whoa. You're the late girl.

12:18.519 --> 12:20.303
I overslept.

12:20.347 --> 12:22.916
Till fifth period?

12:22.958 --> 12:24.351
Talking to Malcolm
last night?

12:24.394 --> 12:26.571
Yeah.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.052
What?

12:30.575 --> 12:31.924
Nothing.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.578
You're having an expression.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.756
I'm not.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.802
But if I was, it'd be saying:

12:39.846 --> 12:41.934
"This just isn't like you."

12:41.977 --> 12:44.546
Not like me
to have a boyfriend?

12:44.588 --> 12:47.114
He's boyfriendly?

12:47.157 --> 12:51.857
I don't understand why
you don't want me to have this.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.513
I mean, boys don't chase me
around all the time.

12:55.557 --> 12:56.687
I thought
you'd be happy for me.

12:56.731 --> 12:58.995
I just want
you to be sure.

12:59.038 --> 13:01.171
To meet him
face-to-face...

13:01.215 --> 13:05.000
in daylight, in a crowded
place with some friends.

13:05.044 --> 13:09.178
You know, before you
become all obsessive.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.835
Malcolm and I
really care about each other.

13:12.879 --> 13:16.796
Big deal if I blow off
a couple classes.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.450
I thought you said
you overslept?

13:19.494 --> 13:23.366
Malcolm said
you wouldn't understand.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.370
Malcolm was right.

13:35.030 --> 13:36.859
Dave?

13:36.903 --> 13:38.991
[keyboard clacking]

13:39.034 --> 13:41.081
Hi there, Dave.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.431
Anybody home?
[gasps]

13:43.474 --> 13:44.866
Oh. What do you want?

13:44.911 --> 13:46.476
I wanted to ask you
something,

13:46.520 --> 13:48.217
if you have a minute.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.567
What is it?

13:49.610 --> 13:52.395
Well, you're
a computer geek-- genius--

13:52.440 --> 13:55.399
and, uh, I sort of have
a technical problem.

13:55.442 --> 13:57.009
If I wanted to find out
something about someone--

13:57.052 --> 14:00.230
if someone e-mailed me--
could I trace the letter?

14:01.710 --> 14:03.885
Well, you could pull up
somebody's profile

14:03.929 --> 14:05.975
based on their user name.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.325
But they write the profile
themselves, right?

14:08.369 --> 14:10.240
I mean, so they can say
anything they wanted.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.850
True.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.808
Wow, I had knowledge.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.812
Well, is there a way
to find out exactly

14:16.855 --> 14:19.162
where a letter--
an e-letter-- came from?

14:19.206 --> 14:21.424
I mean the actual location
of the computer.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.167
It's a challenge.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.951
'Cause, you see, Willow's
got this boyfriend Malcolm,

14:25.995 --> 14:27.213
and to tell you
the truth...

14:27.256 --> 14:28.998
Leave Willow alone.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.695
What do you mean?

14:30.739 --> 14:33.001
That's none of your business.

14:34.611 --> 14:36.527
Dave, are you Malcolm?

14:36.571 --> 14:38.225
Of course not.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.661
[keyboard clacking]

14:39.703 --> 14:41.270
Dave, what's going on?

14:41.315 --> 14:44.447
Look, I'll talk to you later,
okay?

14:44.491 --> 14:46.450
I've got work to do.

14:50.149 --> 14:51.368
[sighs]

14:51.412 --> 14:53.413
So do I.

14:57.634 --> 14:58.809
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.246
It's not just Willow.

15:00.289 --> 15:02.249
Dave, Fritz--
they're all wicked jumpy.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.990
Those boys aren't
sparklingly normal as it is.

15:05.033 --> 15:06.383
Giles, trust me.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.644
I do.

15:07.688 --> 15:09.908
I-I really don't know
how to advise you.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.955
Things involving the computer
fill me with a childlike terror.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.217
Now, if it were a nice ogre
or some such,

15:15.261 --> 15:17.003
I'd be more in my element.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.962
Well, I-I suppose you could,
uh, tail Dave,

15:21.006 --> 15:22.791
see if he's up to something.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.445
Follow Dave?

15:24.488 --> 15:27.230
What, in dark glasses
and a trench coat? Please.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.754
I can work this out myself.

15:29.798 --> 15:32.192
[bell ringing]

15:36.022 --> 15:38.633
[engine starts]

15:38.676 --> 15:41.027
[car driving away]

15:56.302 --> 15:58.304
[car door closes]

16:02.221 --> 16:04.964
[no audio]

16:15.756 --> 16:17.976
[whirring]

16:18.019 --> 16:20.500
[beeping]

16:27.769 --> 16:29.596
She's too close.

16:29.639 --> 16:31.380
What do I do?

16:37.735 --> 16:39.736
Party.

16:44.220 --> 16:47.528
[indistinct conversations]

16:47.571 --> 16:49.572
BUFFY:
Whatever Dave is into,
it's large.

16:49.616 --> 16:51.096
What was the name
of this place?

16:51.139 --> 16:52.793
It said C.R.D.

16:52.836 --> 16:55.404
But I couldn't get close enough
to see what it was.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.407
Calax Research and Development.
It's a computer research lab.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.668
Third largest employer
in Sunnydale,

16:58.712 --> 16:59.888
till it closed down last year.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.892
What, I can't have
information sometimes?

17:03.934 --> 17:06.634
It's just somewhat
unprecedented.

17:06.675 --> 17:08.416
Well, my uncle
used to work there...

17:08.461 --> 17:10.768
in a floor-sweeping capacity.

17:10.810 --> 17:12.335
But it closed?
Uh-huh.

17:12.377 --> 17:14.336
Looked pretty functional
from where I stood.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.861
I don't have a clue
what they were doing.

17:16.904 --> 17:18.776
And what do they need Dave for?

17:18.819 --> 17:20.646
Something about
computers, right?

17:20.691 --> 17:23.564
I mean, he is
off-the-charts smart.

17:23.606 --> 17:26.000
We still don't know
an enormous amount.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.090
Whatever is going on there
may be on the up and up.

17:29.134 --> 17:31.093
No. If C.R.D. opened,
it would have been on the news.

17:31.136 --> 17:32.573
Besides, I can just
tell something's wrong.

17:32.615 --> 17:34.965
My spider sense
is tingling.

17:35.009 --> 17:37.098
Your spider sense?

17:37.143 --> 17:39.101
Pop-culture reference.
Sorry.

17:39.144 --> 17:40.450
Yes, well, [clears throat]

17:40.493 --> 17:42.060
I think we're still
at a standstill.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.278
Short of breaking into
the place, I don't see...

17:43.323 --> 17:44.888
Breaking in.
Then this is the plan.

17:44.932 --> 17:47.108
I'm free tonight.Tonight it is.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.546
A moment, please,
of quiet reflection.

17:49.589 --> 17:53.201
I did not suggest that
you illegally enter the...

17:53.246 --> 17:55.161
[clears throat]
...data into the file

17:55.203 --> 17:57.771
so the book will be listed
by title as well as author.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.471
I just came by to check
your new database,

18:01.515 --> 18:04.170
make sure your cross-reference
table isn't glitching.

18:04.212 --> 18:06.388
'Cause I'm guessing you haven't
gone anywhere near it.

18:06.432 --> 18:09.174
I'm still sorting through
the chaos you left behind you.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.001
Hmm.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.700
You're here again?

18:12.742 --> 18:14.441
You kids really dig
the library, don't you?

18:14.483 --> 18:16.529
We're literary.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.880
Uh, to read makes
our speaking English good.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.708
We'll be going now.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.971
Uh, well, we'll continue this
conversation at another time.

18:23.013 --> 18:24.406
I think we're done.

18:24.451 --> 18:25.930
Makes our speaking
English good?

18:25.973 --> 18:27.714
I panicked, okay?

18:27.758 --> 18:29.238
MALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
I've never felt this way

18:29.281 --> 18:32.459
about anyone before, Willow.

18:32.501 --> 18:35.766
[keyboard clacking]I know what you mean.

18:35.809 --> 18:39.943
I feel like you know me
better than anyone.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.555
I do.

18:41.597 --> 18:45.906
Do you think
we should... meet?

18:45.950 --> 18:47.734
I think we should soon.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.693
I'm nervous.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.306
I'm not. Isn't that strange?

18:53.348 --> 18:56.134
That's what Buffy
doesn't understand--

18:56.177 --> 18:59.876
how comfortable
you can make me feel.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.619
Buffy just makes trouble.

19:03.663 --> 19:07.276
That's why she got kicked out
of her old school.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.194
How did you know that?

19:13.239 --> 19:16.154
It's on her permanent record.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.507
You must have mentioned it.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.512
I guess.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.471
Let's not worry about her
anymore.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.257
I have to sign off.

19:31.299 --> 19:34.173
I'll talk to you later.

19:34.868 --> 19:37.175
Don't.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.442
You're a snob.

19:42.484 --> 19:43.877
I am no such thing.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.444
Oh, you are a big snob.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.185
I mean,
y-you think that knowledge

19:47.229 --> 19:49.536
should be kept in these
carefully guarded repositories

19:49.578 --> 19:52.103
where only a handful
of white guys can get at it.

19:52.146 --> 19:53.670
Nonsense.

19:53.713 --> 19:55.846
I simply don't adhere
to a knee-jerk assumption

19:55.890 --> 19:58.674
that because something is new
it's better.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.286
This isn't a fad, Rupert.

20:00.328 --> 20:02.243
We are creating
a new society here.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.680
A society in which
human interaction

20:03.723 --> 20:05.942
is all but obsolete,
in which people

20:05.987 --> 20:07.554
can be completely
manipulated by technology.

20:07.596 --> 20:09.382
Well-well,

20:09.424 --> 20:10.948
thank you, I'll pass.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.125
Well, I think
you'll be very happy here

20:15.170 --> 20:17.651
with your musty old books.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.087
These musty old books

20:20.131 --> 20:21.480
have a great deal more to say

20:21.523 --> 20:24.134
than any of your
fabulous Web pages.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.007
Hmm.

20:26.049 --> 20:29.096
This one doesn't have
a whole lot more to say.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.796
What is it,
like a diary?

20:34.232 --> 20:36.409
How odd.

20:36.451 --> 20:38.846
I haven't looked through
all the volumes yet.

20:38.888 --> 20:40.239
I didn't, um...

20:43.153 --> 20:44.547
What is it?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.724
Uh, nothing.
Um, a diary, yes.

20:48.769 --> 20:52.032
I imagine that's what it is.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.949
Well, it's been so nice
talking to you.

20:54.991 --> 20:57.125
We were fighting.

20:57.167 --> 20:59.910
Must do it again sometime.

20:59.953 --> 21:01.955
Bye now.

21:03.826 --> 21:06.002
I checked the computer,
and there's nothing in his file

21:06.047 --> 21:07.788
about being allergic
to penicillin.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.049
DAVE:
Buffy.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.703
Dave. How you doing?

21:10.747 --> 21:12.314
Okay.

21:12.357 --> 21:13.968
Look, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

21:14.010 --> 21:15.751
I haven't been getting
much sleep lately, you know?

21:15.796 --> 21:18.145
Don't sweat it.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.061
Willow was looking for you.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.628
Good. I need to talk to her.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.152
Do you know where she is?

21:25.674 --> 21:27.460
She said she'd be in the...
in the girl's locker room.

21:27.502 --> 21:28.982
Great.

21:29.026 --> 21:30.767
Thanks.

21:37.121 --> 21:38.688
Will?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.480
Willow?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.838
[shower running]Will?

21:58.882 --> 22:00.753
Are you taking a shower?

22:04.365 --> 22:05.801
I guess not.

22:13.983 --> 22:15.463
This is how droughts
get started.

22:18.075 --> 22:21.035
Buffy, get out!

22:21.775 --> 22:23.211
[crackling]

22:23.253 --> 22:24.517
[yells]

22:24.559 --> 22:26.736
[grunts]

22:42.838 --> 22:44.798
I can't do it.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.322
I'm not gonna do it.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.324
MALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
But you promised.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.021
Buffy isn't a threat to you!

22:52.066 --> 22:53.894
It's not worth it.

22:53.936 --> 22:56.330
The project is almost complete.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.202
You won't have to do it again.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.990
Oh, I can't.

23:03.032 --> 23:05.513
I've shown you
a new world, Dave.

23:05.557 --> 23:07.429
Knowledge, power...

23:07.472 --> 23:09.170
I can give you everything.

23:09.212 --> 23:11.259
All I want is your love.

23:11.301 --> 23:13.304
No.

23:13.347 --> 23:14.914
This isn't right.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.786
None of it is.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.224
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
I'm sorry.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.617
I've been a terrible person.

23:22.662 --> 23:27.362
I'm a coward, and I can't go on
living like this.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.583
Forgive me, Mom and Dad.

23:30.625 --> 23:34.020
At least now,
I'll have some peace.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.109
Remember me.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.416
Love, Dave.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.728
I'm gonna kill Dave.

23:45.771 --> 23:47.382
He tried to warn me.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.339
Warn you that
he set you up?

23:49.384 --> 23:50.777
Is she going to be okay?

23:50.819 --> 23:52.473
She was only grounded
for a moment.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.607
Still, if you'd been
anyone but the slayer...

23:56.869 --> 23:58.306
Tell me the truth.

23:58.348 --> 24:00.047
How's my hair?

24:00.089 --> 24:02.919
It's great.
It's your best hair ever.

24:02.962 --> 24:04.486
Uh, uh, yes.

24:04.529 --> 24:06.531
I just...

24:06.575 --> 24:08.229
I don't understand
what would make Dave

24:08.271 --> 24:10.404
do a thing like that.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.319
I think perhaps I do.

24:17.193 --> 24:19.848
Does this look familiar
to either of you?

24:19.893 --> 24:22.503
Yeah, sure.
It looks like a book.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.114
I knew that one.

24:24.157 --> 24:26.813
In the Dark Ages,
the souls of demons

24:26.855 --> 24:28.554
were sometimes trapped
in certain volumes.

24:28.596 --> 24:31.773
They remained locked
within the book harmless,

24:31.817 --> 24:34.951
unless the pages
were read aloud.

24:34.994 --> 24:37.998
Unless I'm mistaken,
this is Moloch the Corruptor,

24:38.040 --> 24:40.521
a very deadly
and seductive demon.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.872
He draws people to him
with promises of love,

24:42.915 --> 24:44.221
power, knowledge.

24:44.265 --> 24:47.007
He preys on
impressionable minds.

24:47.049 --> 24:48.311
Like Dave's.

24:48.355 --> 24:50.531
Dave and who knows
how many others.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.186
And Moloch is inside that book?

24:53.230 --> 24:55.102
Not anymore.

24:55.144 --> 24:57.451
XANDER:
You released Moloch?

24:57.496 --> 24:58.845
Way to go.

24:58.887 --> 25:00.237
I didn't read it.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.804
That dreadful Calendar woman
found it

25:01.847 --> 25:03.893
and it was already blank.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.548
Okay, so a powerful demon
with horns

25:06.592 --> 25:09.376
is walking around Sunnydale
and nobody's noticed?

25:09.420 --> 25:11.727
If he's so big and strong,
why bother with Dave?

25:11.770 --> 25:13.642
I mean, why didn't he just
attack Buffy himself?

25:13.685 --> 25:15.122
I don't know.

25:15.164 --> 25:16.602
And I don't know
who could have read that book.

25:16.644 --> 25:18.298
It wasn't even in English.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.039
Where was it?

25:20.083 --> 25:23.913
In a pile with others
that were, um, scanned.

25:26.046 --> 25:28.569
And that released
the demon?

25:28.614 --> 25:30.354
No, he's not out here.

25:30.397 --> 25:32.487
He's in there.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.576
GILES:
The scanner read the book.

25:34.619 --> 25:39.102
It brought Moloch out
as information to be absorbed.

25:39.145 --> 25:42.148
He's gone
binary on us.

25:42.192 --> 25:46.066
Okay, for those of us in our
studio audience who are me,

25:46.108 --> 25:49.416
you guys are saying that
Moloch is in this computer.

25:49.460 --> 25:52.724
And in every computer
connected to it by a modem.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.596
He's everywhere.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.684
What are we going to do?

25:56.729 --> 25:58.599
Willow scanned him
into her file.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.384
It may be a futile gesture,

26:00.428 --> 26:03.561
but I suggest we,
um, delete it.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.998
Solid.

26:07.913 --> 26:10.220
Don't get too close.

26:10.263 --> 26:12.614
Okay.

26:12.657 --> 26:14.049
[sighs] Okay.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.313
[beeps]

26:16.356 --> 26:19.011
So which file
do you think it is?

26:19.055 --> 26:20.709
Willow?

26:20.752 --> 26:22.015
[keyboard clacking]

26:24.583 --> 26:25.932
That's probably it, right?

26:25.974 --> 26:28.238
I'll just delete
the whole thing.

26:30.109 --> 26:32.286
[computer beeps][Buffy gasps]

26:32.328 --> 26:34.114
Stay away from Willow.

26:34.156 --> 26:37.856
It is none of your business.

26:37.900 --> 26:41.163
BUFFY:
So that's what
Malcolm looks like.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.997
So much for "delete file."

26:48.040 --> 26:49.564
This is very bad.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.305
Are we overreacting?
He's in a computer.

26:51.347 --> 26:53.001
What can he do?

26:53.046 --> 26:54.742
You mean, besides convince
a perfectly nice kid

26:54.787 --> 26:57.441
to try and kill me?
I don't know.

26:57.484 --> 27:00.269
How about mess up all the
medical equipment in the world?

27:00.314 --> 27:02.445
Randomize
traffic signals.

27:02.490 --> 27:04.926
Access launch codes
for our nuclear missiles.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.755
Destroy the world's economy.

27:06.798 --> 27:08.670
I think I pretty much
capped it

27:08.713 --> 27:10.105
with that nuclear missile
thing.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.630
Right, yours was best.

27:11.673 --> 27:14.501
Okay, he's a threat. I'm
on board with that now.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.112
But what can we
do about it?

27:16.155 --> 27:18.288
I think the first thing we do
is find Willow.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.550
She's probably talking
to him right now.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.162
God, that creeps me out.

27:22.204 --> 27:23.467
What does he want
with Willow?

27:23.510 --> 27:25.599
Let's never find out.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.471
[sighs]
Okay, um,

27:27.515 --> 27:28.864
I'm going to check
the computer lab,

27:28.907 --> 27:31.519
and you guys call her home.

27:45.750 --> 27:47.752
Willow?

27:52.626 --> 27:54.585
[clicks]

28:03.333 --> 28:05.553
Oh!

28:07.729 --> 28:10.950
[rope creaking]

28:10.992 --> 28:13.430
[phone line ringing]

28:14.823 --> 28:17.478
No answer.Damn it.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.914
Well, it wasn't busy either,
so she's not online.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.396
She's not home.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.789
What did you find?

28:24.833 --> 28:26.442
Willow isn't...

28:26.487 --> 28:28.531
Dave.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.011
He's dead.How?

28:30.056 --> 28:33.058
Well, it looked like suicide.

28:33.102 --> 28:35.322
With a little help
from my friends?

28:35.365 --> 28:36.888
I'd guess Fritz,

28:36.932 --> 28:39.630
or the other zomboids
from C.R.D.

28:39.673 --> 28:42.372
Okay, you and I are going
to go to Willow's house.

28:42.415 --> 28:43.982
Giles, you need
to come up with a way

28:44.026 --> 28:45.288
to get Moloch out of the Net.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.289
I-I have records
of the ceremonies,

28:47.334 --> 28:49.336
but-but that's for
a creature of the flesh.

28:49.378 --> 28:51.730
This could be something
completely different.

28:53.078 --> 28:55.298
Then get Ms. Calendar.
Maybe she can help you.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.822
Even if she could,
how am I going to convince her

28:56.865 --> 28:59.040
that there's a demon
on the Internet?

28:59.085 --> 29:00.346
Okay, fine.
Then you can stay here

29:00.390 --> 29:02.261
and come up with a better plan.
Come on.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.182
[insects chirring]

29:16.755 --> 29:19.192
Mom?

29:19.234 --> 29:21.280
Dad?

FEMALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
You have mail.

You have mail.

[beeps]

30:06.413 --> 30:08.327
[doorbell rings]

30:12.767 --> 30:15.682
Dad, did you forget
your keys again?

30:22.777 --> 30:25.039
[muffled shouting]

30:26.954 --> 30:30.567
No more waiting.

30:30.611 --> 30:33.048
MAN [on radio]:
A spokesman for the archbishop
denied the allegations,

30:33.092 --> 30:35.397
blaming computer error for the
apparent financial discrepancy.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.138
Binding ritual...

30:37.182 --> 30:38.488
In Washington D.C.,
the FBI today reported

30:38.531 --> 30:40.142
that all of the serial
killer profiles

30:40.185 --> 30:42.275
have been mysteriously
downloaded[knocks] Hi.

30:42.317 --> 30:43.711
from its central computer.I got your message.

30:43.753 --> 30:44.972
What's so urgent?[turns off radio]

30:45.017 --> 30:46.670
Um, thank you for coming.

30:46.713 --> 30:48.890
Uh, I need your help.

30:48.933 --> 30:50.848
But before that, um,

30:50.892 --> 30:53.894
I need you to believe
something that, um,

30:53.939 --> 30:55.375
you may not want to.

30:55.417 --> 30:56.855
Uh, there's, uh,

30:56.897 --> 30:58.900
something has got into
the, um,

30:58.943 --> 31:01.597
i-inside, um...

31:01.642 --> 31:03.035
[sighs]

31:03.077 --> 31:05.340
There's a demon
in the Internet.

31:05.384 --> 31:07.125
I know.

31:14.654 --> 31:16.569
BUFFY [calling]:
Willow?!

31:16.613 --> 31:19.528
[sighs]
This isn't good.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.443
Willow?

31:23.445 --> 31:25.317
Willow?!

31:27.972 --> 31:29.625
Okay, any thoughts?

31:31.453 --> 31:33.717
"No more waiting.
I need you to see me."

31:33.760 --> 31:35.719
See him how? Where?

31:35.762 --> 31:38.417
What about C.R.D?The research place?

31:38.461 --> 31:40.115
I'm guessing that's
Moloch central.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.942
I'm guessing
that's our best lead.

31:41.987 --> 31:44.163
Let's just hope Giles
can back us up.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.818
You already know? Uh...

31:48.863 --> 31:50.909
How exactly is that?

31:50.951 --> 31:53.259
Come on, there have been
portents for days.

31:53.301 --> 31:56.392
I mean, power surges,
online shutdowns.

31:56.435 --> 31:59.352
You should see the bones
I've been casting.

31:59.394 --> 32:01.570
I knew this would happen
sooner or later.

32:01.615 --> 32:04.443
I mean, it's probably a...
a mischief demon,

32:04.487 --> 32:06.532
you know, like Kelkor or...

32:06.576 --> 32:07.621
It's Moloch.

32:07.663 --> 32:10.102
The Corruptor?

32:10.144 --> 32:12.451
Oh, boy.
[scoffs]

32:12.494 --> 32:13.932
I should have remembered.
I just don't...

32:13.974 --> 32:17.413
You don't seem exactly
surprised by...

32:17.457 --> 32:19.067
Who are you?

32:19.111 --> 32:21.765
I teach computer science
at the local high school.

32:21.808 --> 32:24.768
A profession that hardly lends
itself to the casting of bones.

32:24.811 --> 32:26.509
Wrong and wrong, snobby.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.555
I mean, you think the realm
of the mystical

32:28.597 --> 32:30.861
is limited to ancient texts
and relics?

32:30.904 --> 32:33.603
That bad old science
made the magic go away?

32:33.646 --> 32:37.825
Mmm... The divine exists
in cyberspace same as out here.

32:37.867 --> 32:39.869
Are you a witch?

32:39.913 --> 32:42.786
Mm, I don't have
that kind of power.

32:42.829 --> 32:45.006
Technopagan is the term.

32:45.049 --> 32:46.442
[chuckles softly]

32:46.486 --> 32:48.967
There are more of us
than you think.

32:49.009 --> 32:52.404
Well, uh,
you can definitely help me.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.972
Um...

32:55.016 --> 32:58.627
What's in cyberspace at the
moment is less than divine.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.369
I have the binding rituals
at hand,

33:01.413 --> 33:03.154
but I'm completely
out of my idiom.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.548
Well, I can help...
I think.

33:05.592 --> 33:09.029
I hope. I mean, well,
this is my first real...

33:09.074 --> 33:10.901
Do you know how he got in?

33:10.944 --> 33:14.383
He was, uh, scanned is
the term, I believe.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.167
And you want him
back in the book?

33:16.211 --> 33:18.518
[ringing]

33:20.172 --> 33:21.520
Buffy?

33:21.564 --> 33:22.826
Yeah.GILES: Willow?

33:22.869 --> 33:24.175
Not at home.

33:24.219 --> 33:26.003
It looks like
she was taken somewhere.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.179
Where are you?

33:27.221 --> 33:29.571
C.R.D. Whatever Moloch wants
Willow for,

33:29.615 --> 33:31.574
it's probably in there.

33:31.617 --> 33:34.055
Ms. Calendar and I are working
to get Moloch off-line.

33:34.098 --> 33:35.970
Here's a tip: hurry.

Welcome, my love.

34:02.213 --> 34:05.826
I can't tell you
how good it is to see you...

34:10.135 --> 34:13.050
...with my own two eyes.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.539
Willow.

[quietly]:
Malcolm?

34:26.106 --> 34:28.065
[mechanical whirring]

34:29.545 --> 34:31.938
MOLOCH:
This world is so new,

34:31.981 --> 34:34.072
so exciting.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.813
I can see all of it.

34:36.856 --> 34:39.380
Everything flows through me.

34:39.425 --> 34:41.121
I know the secrets
of your kings.

34:41.166 --> 34:44.690
But nothing compares
to having form again.

34:44.733 --> 34:47.650
To be able to walk,
to touch.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.871
[bones crack]

34:51.914 --> 34:53.393
To kill.

34:53.438 --> 34:55.963
[thuds]

35:01.621 --> 35:03.143
[Xander yells]

35:08.715 --> 35:10.019
Back way?

35:10.063 --> 35:11.413
Back way.

35:18.202 --> 35:20.639
Here they come.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.862
The first thing we have to do
is form the Circle of Kayless,

35:25.905 --> 35:27.342
right?

35:27.385 --> 35:29.431
Form a circle?
But there's only two of us.

35:29.474 --> 35:31.215
That's really more of a line.

35:31.259 --> 35:32.652
You're not getting
it, Rupert.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.262
We have to form
the circle inside.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.697
I'm putting out a flash.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.264
I just hope enough
of my group responds.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.005
[keyboard clacking]Won't Moloch just shut you down?

35:39.048 --> 35:40.528
Well, I'm betting he won't
figure out what we're doing

35:40.572 --> 35:41.965
until it's too late.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.750
Hoping and betting,
that's what we've got.

35:43.793 --> 35:46.927
You want to throw in
praying, be my guest.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.538
I don't understand.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.105
What do you want from me?

35:51.148 --> 35:53.454
I want to give you the world.

35:53.498 --> 35:55.108
Why?

35:55.152 --> 35:57.067
You created me.

35:57.110 --> 35:59.722
I brought these humans
together to build me a body,

35:59.766 --> 36:01.898
but you gave me life,

36:01.942 --> 36:04.117
took me out of the book
that held me.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.077
I want to repay you.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.210
By lying to me?

36:09.253 --> 36:12.735
By pretending to be a person?

36:12.778 --> 36:15.608
Pretending you loved me?

36:15.650 --> 36:17.739
I do.

[door bangs open]

36:22.918 --> 36:24.311
Uh, Buffy?

36:25.704 --> 36:27.097
It's her.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.273
Yeah, who's
the other guy?

36:31.927 --> 36:34.887
Don't you see?

36:34.931 --> 36:36.237
I can give you everything.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.632
I can control the world.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.547
Right now,
a man in Beijing

36:41.590 --> 36:43.853
is transferring money
to a Swiss bank account

36:43.896 --> 36:46.943
for a contract
on his mother's life.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.597
Good for him.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.996
I can't bust it.
It's heavy steel.

36:56.039 --> 36:58.259
Then let's find
another way in.

[alarm blaring]

37:05.092 --> 37:06.789
What's going on?

37:07.789 --> 37:10.402

is computerized.

Whoops.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.280
Couldn't you just stop Moloch

37:19.324 --> 37:22.108
by-by entering
some computer virus?

37:22.152 --> 37:24.023
You've seen way
too many movies.

37:24.067 --> 37:25.286
[computer beeps]

37:25.329 --> 37:26.940
Okay, we're up.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.028
You read, I type.
Ready?

37:29.072 --> 37:30.378
I am.

Let me leave.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.400
But I love you.

37:52.443 --> 37:53.835
Don't say that.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.228
That's a joke.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.449
You don't love anything.

37:57.492 --> 37:59.320
You are mine.

37:59.364 --> 38:02.235
I'm not yours.
I'm never gonna be yours.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.454
Never.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.260

Malcolm!

Remember me?
Your girlfriend?

I think it's time we break up,

but maybe we can
still be friends.

I have left,

41:36.929 --> 41:39.322
Welcome to my world.

41:39.365 --> 41:40.541
You scared?

41:40.585 --> 41:43.630
I'm remaining calm,
thank you.

41:43.675 --> 41:47.505
I just wanted to,
uh, return this.

41:47.547 --> 41:49.507
I found it
among the new books

41:49.550 --> 41:51.333
and naturally,
I thought of you.

41:51.378 --> 41:53.554
Cool. Thanks.

41:53.597 --> 41:56.601
Uh, well, I'll-I'll
see you anon.

41:56.643 --> 42:00.081
Can't get out of here
fast enough, can you?

42:00.126 --> 42:03.128
Truthfully, I'm even less
anxious to be around computers

42:03.172 --> 42:04.913
than I used to be.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.612
Well, it was your book
that started all the trouble,

42:07.655 --> 42:09.264
not a computer.

42:09.309 --> 42:11.398
[sighs]

42:11.440 --> 42:14.574
Honestly, what is it about them
that bothers you so much?

42:15.445 --> 42:17.708
The smell.

42:17.751 --> 42:20.275
Computers don't smell, Rupert.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.103
I know.

42:22.148 --> 42:26.543
Smell is the most powerful
trigger to the memory there is.

42:26.586 --> 42:28.588
A certain flower
or a whiff of smoke

42:28.632 --> 42:32.724
can bring up experiences
long forgotten.

42:33.898 --> 42:38.860
Books smell musty
and-and rich.

42:38.903 --> 42:42.559
The knowledge gained
from a computer is-is...

42:42.603 --> 42:44.865
it has no-no texture,

42:44.909 --> 42:46.389
no-no context.

42:46.432 --> 42:48.869
It's there
and then it's gone.

42:48.914 --> 42:51.264
If it's to last,
then the getting of knowledge

42:51.306 --> 42:52.918
should be, uh, tangible.

42:52.960 --> 42:54.876
It should be, uh...

42:54.920 --> 42:56.617
smelly.

42:58.967 --> 43:02.971
Well, you really are an
old-fashioned boy, aren't you?

43:03.014 --> 43:07.409
Well, I-I don't dangle
a corkscrew from my ear.

43:07.454 --> 43:10.456
That's not where I dangle it.

43:17.246 --> 43:20.380
We going to go to the
Bronze tonight, we three?

43:20.422 --> 43:22.382
It'll be fun.

43:22.425 --> 43:24.601
Yeah. Willow, fun?

43:24.644 --> 43:27.081
Remember fun? That
thing where you smile?

43:27.126 --> 43:28.693
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

43:28.735 --> 43:30.259
I'm just thinking about...

43:30.302 --> 43:31.521
Malcolm?

43:31.565 --> 43:34.568
Malcolm, Moloch,
whatever he's called.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.614
The one boy
that's really liked me,

43:36.657 --> 43:38.746
and he's a demon robot.

43:38.789 --> 43:40.791
What does that say
about me?

43:40.835 --> 43:43.010
It doesn't say
anything about you.

43:43.054 --> 43:46.188
I mean, I thought
I was really falling...

43:46.231 --> 43:48.059
Hey, did you forget?

43:48.103 --> 43:50.365
The one boy I've had
the hots for since I moved here

43:50.409 --> 43:52.019
turned out to be a vampire.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.630
Right. And the teacher
I had a crush on:

43:53.673 --> 43:55.588
giant praying mantis.

43:55.632 --> 43:57.851
That's true.

43:57.896 --> 44:00.072
Yeah, it's life
on the hellmouth.

44:00.114 --> 44:01.550
Let's face it.
None of us are ever going

44:01.594 --> 44:03.552
to have a happy,
normal relationship.

44:03.597 --> 44:05.686
We're doomed.
WILLOW:
Yeah.

44:05.730 --> 44:07.949
[all laughing]

44:49.512 --> 44:51.905
Grr. Argh.
