02:14.834 --> 02:18.964
<i>This is a.44 Magnum,</i>
<i>the most powerful handgun in the world.</i>

02:19.805 --> 02:21.966
<i>And it could blow your head clean off.</i>

02:23.209 --> 02:24.403
<i>Do you feel lucky?</i>

02:30.282 --> 02:33.843
Mr. Ricca!
How do you feel about your acquittal?

02:33.953 --> 02:37.354
It proves what I always said,
I had nothing to do with Scarza's murder.

02:37.423 --> 02:39.948
Who could have killed
Anthony Scarza and his family?

02:40.025 --> 02:42.585
That's a stupid question. Get off my back!

02:43.129 --> 02:47.156
Mr. Weinstein, explain the technicality
involving the lack of admissible evidence.

02:47.233 --> 02:50.293
That's a legality
that can't be explained at this time.

02:50.403 --> 02:53.236
Mr. Weinstein, you don't seem surprised
about the decision.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.865
I don't know why they waste
the taxpayers' money.

02:55.941 --> 02:59.934
This whole thing is an arbitrary attack
on a legitimate businessman.

03:00.312 --> 03:02.280
- Do you have any comments?
- What, dear?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.111
Do you have any other comments?

03:04.183 --> 03:06.617
I'll give you a comment:
Their minds are dead.

03:06.685 --> 03:09.153
- What do you mean by that?
- Their minds are dead.

03:09.221 --> 03:11.781
Mr. Ricca means he is very pleased
with the decision.

03:11.857 --> 03:13.984
There's a big crowd.
Do you fear for your life?

03:14.059 --> 03:15.754
No, of course not.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.388
Mr. Estabrook.

03:19.465 --> 03:22.400
As the prosecutor,
how do you feel about the court's decision?

03:22.468 --> 03:24.766
It's happened before,
it'll probably happen again.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.270
I have no more comments.

03:29.942 --> 03:32.172
I'm sorry, no comments. No comments!

03:32.545 --> 03:33.739
I have no comments.

03:48.494 --> 03:51.054
You know what I think?
I'll tell you what I think!

03:51.130 --> 03:53.064
Fuck the courts, that's what I think!

03:53.132 --> 03:57.068
They've already wasted too much time
worrying about the rights of killers!

03:57.136 --> 03:58.501
Ricca, you're a killer!

04:10.082 --> 04:11.447
Get in the car! Go on!

04:38.310 --> 04:39.299
Murderer!

04:59.832 --> 05:02.130
<i>Today the noted labor leader</i>
<i>Carmine Ricca...</i>

05:02.201 --> 05:05.637
<i>... was acquitted on a technicality:</i>
<i>The lack of admissible evidence.</i>

05:06.338 --> 05:08.499
Ricca had been charged with complicity...

05:08.574 --> 05:12.305
...in the murders of labor reformer
Anthony Scarza and his family.

05:12.778 --> 05:16.214
When he appeared outside
the courthouse this afternoon, a free man...

05:16.315 --> 05:19.113
<i>... it touched off a wild,</i>
<i>mob-like demonstration.</i>

05:19.518 --> 05:22.453
<i>But the police were finally able</i>
<i>to bring it under control...</i>

05:22.521 --> 05:25.012
<i>... and there have been</i>
<i>no reports of injuries.</i>

05:25.090 --> 05:28.992
<i>But one can expect an uproar</i>
<i>from an angry and alarmed crowd...</i>

05:29.161 --> 05:31.789
<i>... which fully expected Ricca</i>
<i>to be convicted.</i>

05:32.164 --> 05:35.463
<i>And I'm sure we haven't heard</i>
<i>the last of the Ricca case.</i>

05:36.368 --> 05:38.529
<i>Art Brown reporting from city hall.</i>

06:43.802 --> 06:44.666
Cop.

06:46.305 --> 06:47.795
Gino, for Christ's sake.

06:47.873 --> 06:51.775
Come on, Carmine.
I'm driving this thing like a baby carriage.

07:45.964 --> 07:48.125
Could I see your driver's license, please?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.100
Do you know who that is
sitting back there?

07:50.169 --> 07:53.104
I'll still have to see
your driver's license, please.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.029
I'll have to find it.

07:55.407 --> 07:57.341
Do you know why you're being stopped?

07:58.777 --> 08:02.235
Yes, we know, Officer,
and you're making a big mistake.

08:02.548 --> 08:05.449
- You crossed a double line back there.
- A double line?

08:05.517 --> 08:06.916
Take it easy.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.479
Whatever you say, Officer.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.049
I just happened to find it, sir.

08:22.434 --> 08:24.095
That's right, Simple Simon.

08:24.536 --> 08:26.902
Check, see if it's stolen.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.035
I want this bastard busted out of his job.

08:30.109 --> 08:33.601
We'll take care of this guy.
You fellas, just take it easy.

08:46.458 --> 08:49.689
- This car registered to you?
- To him.

08:50.329 --> 08:54.231
- I'll have to see the registration.
- Come on, give me that license.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.533
That's okay.

09:36.408 --> 09:38.308
Hi, Harry. Is this your case?

09:58.630 --> 09:59.619
Walter?

10:02.267 --> 10:04.633
Hello, Harry. What are you doing here?

10:05.270 --> 10:07.761
This couldn't have happened
to a nicer bunch.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.105
Ricca, Weinstein, his attorney.
James Cantina, the driver.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.311
What about the bodyguard?

10:13.378 --> 10:15.778
We're checking that out now, Lieutenant.

10:15.848 --> 10:19.511
Looks like somebody saved
the taxpayers a lot of money, doesn't it?

10:20.085 --> 10:23.577
Callahan, what're you doing here?
You're on loan to stakeout.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.884
We had nothing hot on,
besides, we were close.

10:27.392 --> 10:31.556
Callahan, you get your lying ass in gear
and get back to that stake-out squad.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.697
Anything else, you call it in.

10:38.604 --> 10:42.472
- Who do you think did this, Briggs?
- You're on loan to stakeout, Callahan.

10:42.541 --> 10:45.032
That's right, Lieutenant, you saw to that.

10:45.510 --> 10:48.240
I've got nothing personal
against you, Callahan.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.811
But we can't have the public crying,
"police brutality"...

10:51.884 --> 10:53.875
...every time you're on the street.

10:53.952 --> 10:56.386
You just might need me on a job like this.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.616
Whoever did this was very good at it.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.783
You'd sure be the one to know, Harry.

11:00.859 --> 11:03.726
- Well, I just work for this city, Briggs.
- So do I.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.995
Longer than you.

11:06.798 --> 11:10.894
And I never had to take my gun out
of its holster, once. I'm proud of that.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.363
Well, you're a good man, Lieutenant.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.271
A good man always knows his limitations.

11:19.077 --> 11:22.979
- Lt. Briggs?
- Yeah?

11:24.917 --> 11:26.077
What did you get?

11:26.151 --> 11:28.847
Well, it looks like
they were killed with a Magnum.

11:28.987 --> 11:32.650
The boys now are checking
the blood types and for fingerprints.

11:35.594 --> 11:36.959
What do you have?

11:37.129 --> 11:41.566
Driver's license. Doesn't look at all
like the usual gangster crap, does it?

11:42.434 --> 11:45.164
Briggs has his nose up his ass today.

11:45.971 --> 11:49.134
I guess he thinks
that's where his promotion is.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.205
See you later, Harry.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.805
What's with you and Briggs anyway?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.479
Jealousy.

11:56.748 --> 12:00.741
He knows this is the kind of case
I should be on. It's just a matter of time.

12:01.486 --> 12:03.647
Hey, Early, want to get in on this?

12:05.390 --> 12:06.880
What the hell is that about?

12:06.959 --> 12:10.395
They're giving odds on how long
you'll stay alive being my partner.

12:10.462 --> 12:11.724
Are you kidding?

12:11.930 --> 12:13.022
Nope.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.962
How long did your last partner go?

12:15.033 --> 12:16.193
A couple of weeks.

12:16.268 --> 12:19.431
Don't worry, he's still alive,
teaching college.

12:20.505 --> 12:22.166
You have another trade, Smith?

12:22.240 --> 12:23.764
No, no. Do you?

12:23.842 --> 12:25.673
No, but Bill Mackenzie does.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.871
Who in the hell is Bill Mackenzie?

12:27.980 --> 12:31.143
He's an ex-homicide man,
has a snack shop out at the airport.

12:31.216 --> 12:33.309
Greatest burgers in town. Hungry?

12:34.086 --> 12:37.283
- How can you be hungry after seeing that?
- Seeing what?

12:54.306 --> 12:57.867
So, Ricca finally bought it.
There must be hope for the world yet.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.445
How about you? Do you want something?

13:00.512 --> 13:04.414
- We got chili and garlic bread today.
- No, thank you. I don't feel very hungry.

13:04.483 --> 13:08.180
In broad daylight at close range?
Must've looked like ripe melons.

13:10.389 --> 13:13.483
<i>Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,</i>
<i>use white courtesy telephone.</i>

13:13.558 --> 13:15.048
Now all keep calm.

13:18.296 --> 13:20.423
I'll never forget the Floyd case.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.660
Got it with an axe during the rush hour.

13:23.468 --> 13:24.992
How about some cream pie?

13:25.070 --> 13:28.528
<i>Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,</i>
<i>use white courtesy telephone.</i>

13:28.607 --> 13:31.838
Must be trouble.
That's the airport code name for trouble.

14:17.522 --> 14:20.355
We've got 90 people being terrorized
by those maniacs...

14:20.425 --> 14:22.222
...in boarding area B right now.

14:22.294 --> 14:25.320
What's taking so long?
They said they'd be there in 15 minutes?

14:25.397 --> 14:26.887
Where's that overseas pilot?

14:26.965 --> 14:29.695
I don't understand.
How did they get through security?

14:29.768 --> 14:31.793
- I don't know.
- Any problems here?

14:31.870 --> 14:33.360
What are you doing here?

14:33.472 --> 14:36.236
- I'm sorry, you'll have to leave.
- I'm a police officer.

14:36.475 --> 14:39.638
We've got two frantic hijackers
on our New York flight.

14:40.779 --> 14:43.907
- Have you called the FBI?
- They're on their way here right now.

14:43.982 --> 14:47.008
But the hijackers want an overseas pilot
before they take off.

14:50.388 --> 14:52.083
May I make a suggestion?

15:25.690 --> 15:26.952
Good afternoon.

15:27.159 --> 15:30.094
You took your goddamn time about it.
Now, close that door!

15:30.495 --> 15:32.292
All right, what's in there?

15:33.431 --> 15:35.661
Overseas charts and flight plans.

15:35.734 --> 15:36.894
Set it down!

15:38.770 --> 15:40.397
All right, turn around.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.404
Stay there.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.020
All right, turn around here.

15:59.724 --> 16:01.885
Here! Now get in there!

16:04.329 --> 16:08.527
- It's all yours now.
- All right get this thing up!

16:11.369 --> 16:12.768
Where to?

16:13.438 --> 16:16.339
You get us up,
I'll tell you where to when we're up.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.048
You want to put us in take-off position?

16:28.987 --> 16:30.284
Starting three.

17:25.477 --> 17:26.704
Move it!

17:28.680 --> 17:30.170
All right, I'll take it.

18:00.845 --> 18:04.246
That's right, Lieutenant. We were lucky
to have one of your men here.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.784
He's on board now, an Inspector Callahan.

18:07.686 --> 18:08.584
Callahan!

18:25.570 --> 18:29.131
Excuse me, Captain.
I know this may sound silly...

18:29.240 --> 18:30.798
...but can you fly?

18:31.609 --> 18:34.203
No. Never had a lesson.

19:02.741 --> 19:03.730
Sit down!

19:47.986 --> 19:50.181
What are you doing here, Lieutenant?

20:24.022 --> 20:27.685
Harry! You crazy son of a bitch!
I could've killed you.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.923
Yeah, I noticed that, Charlie.
What the hell you doing?

20:30.995 --> 20:33.020
I haven't seen you in a coon's age.

20:33.097 --> 20:36.692
I been meaning to drop by,
but we've been kind of busy.

20:37.035 --> 20:40.402
Yeah, well,
I ain't living with Carol anymore.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.600
Sorry to hear that.

20:42.674 --> 20:46.735
Yeah. It's my third time at bat.

20:48.646 --> 20:49.874
Where's the time go?

20:51.182 --> 20:52.649
I'm afraid of time.

20:53.117 --> 20:57.486
I know you 10 years already, ever since
I first came out here, you realize that?

20:57.922 --> 21:00.720
You don't look older to me.
Do I look older to you?

21:04.229 --> 21:06.720
Why don't you put in
for some desk work, Charlie?

21:06.798 --> 21:08.698
You don't need the streets anymore.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.961
We should've put our 20 in the Marines.

21:11.269 --> 21:15.171
These days,
a cop kills a hoodlum on the street...

21:15.340 --> 21:17.831
...he might as well just dump
the body some place.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.275
Because those snot-nosed
young bastards...

21:20.345 --> 21:23.940
...down at the DA's office will crucify them
one way or another.

21:24.015 --> 21:26.950
A hood can kill a cop,
but let a cop kill a hood...

21:27.685 --> 21:28.811
Am I right?

21:30.788 --> 21:34.690
You put in plenty of time,
why don't you go for retirement?

21:35.326 --> 21:37.157
What the hell, you don't need this.

21:37.562 --> 21:41.589
I know you 10 years.
I'll tell you something, I'll never retire.

21:41.966 --> 21:42.955
Never!

21:44.736 --> 21:46.465
I'm going out fighting.

21:47.171 --> 21:49.537
That's the only way to go. Am I right?

22:43.394 --> 22:44.520
You boys rookies?

22:44.896 --> 22:46.625
Yes, sir. Traffic.

22:46.864 --> 22:49.298
I'm John Davis. This is Phil Sweet.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.801
That's Red Astrachan, Mike Grimes.

22:53.137 --> 22:55.935
- You're Inspector Harry Callahan, no?
- That's right.

22:56.007 --> 22:59.033
What are you doing here?
Don't you have regular times for this?

22:59.110 --> 23:02.011
You shouldn't be on the streets
if you can't shoot well.

23:02.180 --> 23:05.479
- Killers don't make allowances.
- You're in big trouble.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.047
Can't fault you there.

23:07.118 --> 23:09.780
Are you shooting
in the combat championship next week?

23:09.854 --> 23:10.786
I always do.

23:10.855 --> 23:14.484
- You win every year, don't you?
- Became sort of an institution around here.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.754
Yes, sir, we've heard all about you.

23:18.630 --> 23:22.122
This is about the only time
I get this place alone.

23:22.433 --> 23:25.163
We'll leave if you'd like
the range to yourself.

23:28.873 --> 23:30.397
No, that's all right.

23:32.644 --> 23:35.112
What kind of a load do you use in that.44?

23:35.179 --> 23:36.612
A light special.

23:36.681 --> 23:39.514
This size gun gives me better control
and less recoil...

23:39.584 --> 23:42.212
...than a.357 Magnum with wadcutters.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.574
That's not bad.

24:15.453 --> 24:16.545
Care to try?

24:16.621 --> 24:18.316
No, sir. No, I don't think so.

24:18.389 --> 24:21.085
- Come on, give it a try.
- Go on, Sweet.

24:24.729 --> 24:26.026
I'm farsighted.

24:31.402 --> 24:32.426
Don't drop it.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.521
Hey, that's not bad.

24:53.825 --> 24:57.158
Well, I think it's just a little heavy for me.
I missed one.

24:57.261 --> 24:58.626
You'll get used to it.

24:59.030 --> 25:01.294
Where did you learn to shoot?
Not around here.

25:01.365 --> 25:04.198
No, sir, no.
Airborne Rangers, Special Forces.

25:06.170 --> 25:08.297
And the rest of these guys, even close?

25:08.372 --> 25:10.840
Well, Grimes here, he's...

25:11.409 --> 25:13.343
...I guess he's about even with me.

25:13.411 --> 25:16.437
Astrachan's a little better on a good day.

25:16.981 --> 25:19.609
And Davis is just dog nuts.
He's a lot better.

25:20.752 --> 25:25.815
A lot better? Sure show a sense of style.
Sweet, is it?

25:25.890 --> 25:26.982
Yes, sir.

25:27.391 --> 25:30.383
When I get back on Homicide,
I hope you boys will come see me.

25:30.461 --> 25:32.429
- Good.
- Thank you very much, we'd like that.

25:32.497 --> 25:34.124
Let's go!

25:34.198 --> 25:36.098
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

25:37.902 --> 25:39.733
Who buys? The sun was in my eyes!

25:39.804 --> 25:43.001
- You got to be on, Grimes.
- The sun is always in your eyes.

25:43.374 --> 25:46.832
How come I always have to buy
the beer for you turkeys.

25:48.246 --> 25:50.578
Where do you want to go?

26:38.262 --> 26:39.991
Put your hat on!

26:40.064 --> 26:41.793
Come on now, baby.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.611
Will you look at my ring!

27:18.669 --> 27:19.727
It's beautiful!

28:40.851 --> 28:42.216
Is this a gang war?

28:42.286 --> 28:43.913
You have nothing to say?

28:44.188 --> 28:47.919
- Do you expect more murder or violence?
- I have nothing to say at this time.

28:48.092 --> 28:50.617
- Is this a gang war, Lieutenant?
- No comment.

28:50.695 --> 28:55.064
There were 200 murders last year.
Do you want to make a comment on that?

28:57.802 --> 29:01.329
There'll be no bombs in pools.
This town belongs to the people.

29:01.505 --> 29:03.598
We're gonna have law and order here.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.400
<i>That's all I have to say at this time.</i>

29:06.477 --> 29:08.672
<i>What does that mean, Lieutenant?</i>

29:18.322 --> 29:21.086
You're it!

29:26.197 --> 29:27.391
You're it!

29:28.632 --> 29:30.623
Don't you want to play with us?

29:30.835 --> 29:33.861
- Well, I don't know, sweetheart.
- Just a little while?

29:33.938 --> 29:36.236
You're really getting the full treatment.

29:36.307 --> 29:38.775
It's not often you get a sit-down dinner.

29:40.444 --> 29:43.936
Okay, kids. All right, that's enough.

29:44.982 --> 29:48.418
- Just a little bit more, just five minutes?
- Let's go, let's go.

29:48.486 --> 29:50.784
Say good night to Harry and off to bed.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.914
- Good night.
- Good night, my love.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.323
- Good night.
- Take it easy.

29:56.527 --> 29:58.688
- 'Bye.
- Good night, Harry.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.828
Take the jacket out of your mouth,
sweetheart.

30:15.212 --> 30:17.578
Boy, sometimes they're too much for me.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.883
But then I can't afford
a woman coming in anymore.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.847
I think you manage quite well.

30:24.922 --> 30:26.947
Well, I just laugh all day long.

30:28.759 --> 30:30.249
I'm glad you called.

30:32.463 --> 30:35.125
Tell me, have you seen Charlie?

30:37.101 --> 30:38.830
Yes, I saw him last night.

30:38.903 --> 30:40.370
Wanted to see the kids...

30:40.438 --> 30:44.101
...and then he started playing
a little Russian roulette with his revolver.

30:45.142 --> 30:46.404
What happened?

30:46.710 --> 30:50.476
What could I do? I went next door,
we finally got him to stop.

30:50.614 --> 30:52.275
What do you tell your children...

30:52.349 --> 30:55.546
...when they ask why their father
tried to shoot himself?

30:56.487 --> 30:58.114
What did you tell them?

30:58.889 --> 31:02.552
I just said it was a special kind of sickness
that some people have...

31:02.626 --> 31:06.858
...and that there are doctors
who could cure it... as if they could.

31:10.167 --> 31:12.431
Do you know where he's living right now?

31:13.471 --> 31:16.065
I don't know and I don't care anymore.

31:18.342 --> 31:22.335
He's so sick.
He shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun.

31:27.418 --> 31:31.115
Do you know that he was living
in North Beach with some nude dancer?

31:37.828 --> 31:40.319
Oh, well, I'm glad I'm over that one.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.930
I do have to survive.

31:44.401 --> 31:45.425
You will.

31:48.973 --> 31:53.637
You know, Harry, if I ask you
a personal question, would you mind?

31:54.411 --> 31:55.935
Sure, go ahead.

31:57.047 --> 32:01.279
Are you sure?
Because, well, it's a little difficult.

32:02.987 --> 32:06.047
Look, we've been friends a long time,
go ahead and ask.

32:10.027 --> 32:13.895
Well, I'm just wondering
why you've never made a pass at me.

32:20.237 --> 32:21.101
Why?

32:25.242 --> 32:26.607
Goddamn it.

32:29.346 --> 32:32.281
With all those kids
do you think I'll ever get laid?

32:42.126 --> 32:43.093
Hello?

32:45.329 --> 32:47.024
Yes, just a moment.

32:47.331 --> 32:49.265
It's for you.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.761
What's happening?

32:51.936 --> 32:52.903
Yeah?

32:53.938 --> 32:55.667
Yeah, Early, I saw it on TV.

32:58.175 --> 33:00.439
I'll be right down.
I'll come in the back way.

33:04.248 --> 33:06.273
- That's it, right?
- I have to go.

33:07.117 --> 33:08.516
Goodnight, Harry.

33:10.554 --> 33:12.021
Goodnight, sweetheart.

34:14.585 --> 34:15.745
How's it going?

34:15.886 --> 34:17.513
By the magazine rack.

34:18.022 --> 34:21.685
The owner remembers seeing him
just before the last robbery.

34:22.359 --> 34:25.351
Yeah, he doesn't look much
like a paying customer, does he?

34:26.730 --> 34:30.291
- There's a car parked out in front.
- That's right, a no parking zone.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.032
Get over there by the door
with that shotgun.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.001
Okay.

34:39.109 --> 34:41.270
You think it'll be a hit or a miss?

35:25.022 --> 35:27.582
Well, here's three salty looking dudes.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.602
Freeze, nigger!

35:43.974 --> 35:46.875
- What you got there?
- Don't you go setting off no alarm.

35:47.277 --> 35:48.972
You! Get over here, fast!

35:50.047 --> 35:52.311
- You got a safe, nigger?
- No.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.577
You lying sack of shit.

35:59.590 --> 36:02.286
All right, take it easy. Take it easy now.

36:02.893 --> 36:03.882
Suck it!

36:05.662 --> 36:06.651
Suck it!

36:08.132 --> 36:10.157
I'll kill you. I said, suck it.

36:13.036 --> 36:14.367
You go find that safe.

36:17.641 --> 36:20.007
Right here is where I kill me a nigger.

36:21.378 --> 36:22.777
Get on your knees.

36:24.548 --> 36:25.947
Get on your knees.

36:30.654 --> 36:31.814
Better get out there now.

36:31.889 --> 36:32.947
Not yet.

36:34.725 --> 36:35.953
Get on your knees.

36:58.649 --> 36:59.616
Police!

36:59.883 --> 37:00.645
Drop it!

37:05.355 --> 37:06.822
All right, hold it!

37:56.974 --> 37:58.441
I never shot a man.

38:01.912 --> 38:04.005
Why don't you help the lady?

38:06.383 --> 38:08.408
It's all right, ma'am.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.403
You handled yourself real well tonight.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.108
You work close. Man, you work close.

38:44.454 --> 38:46.319
Hey, where are you guys off to?

38:46.390 --> 38:49.985
- The Downtown Bowl on Eddy Street.
- Oh, yeah. See you later.

38:50.460 --> 38:53.623
- You know them?
- They came from the academy after me.

38:53.697 --> 38:55.597
They stick together like fly paper.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.464
Everybody thought
they were queer for each other.

38:58.869 --> 39:02.100
I'll tell you something,
if the rest of you could shoot like them...

39:02.172 --> 39:05.403
...I wouldn't care
if the whole damn department was queer.

39:23.594 --> 39:25.585
Excuse me, it's very important.

39:28.298 --> 39:29.993
What do you think you're doing?

39:42.279 --> 39:43.906
1000 O'Farrell.

40:05.669 --> 40:09.799
We're not going to get there
unless you keep your eyes on the road.

40:10.674 --> 40:13.108
Right on. 1000 O'Farrell.

40:52.082 --> 40:53.982
Too bad you're not on welfare.

40:55.152 --> 40:56.779
I'd give you a freebie.

41:03.093 --> 41:04.025
Drive.

41:11.635 --> 41:14.968
- Sidney, I was just on my way to see you.
- Where to?

41:15.072 --> 41:18.200
- Just keep on going until I tell you to stop.
- Yes, sir.

41:18.408 --> 41:19.705
Drop that flag.

41:22.145 --> 41:24.739
- You're on your way to see me?
- Yes, Sidney, honest.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.908
How come you didn't come by the crib?

41:26.983 --> 41:28.610
- Well...
- Don't shit me.

41:28.885 --> 41:30.079
I wouldn't do that.

41:30.153 --> 41:33.850
- I've been waiting for you for one week.
- I've been working the convention.

41:33.924 --> 41:37.223
- No telephones in that hotel?
- I've been working like hell, you know?

41:39.663 --> 41:41.028
Let me show you.

41:44.067 --> 41:46.934
- See? It's all here, all I got.
- AII?

41:47.804 --> 41:50.034
Looks like you've been holding out on me.

41:50.107 --> 41:53.804
No, I haven't. I've been straight
with you, Sidney. You know me.

41:54.111 --> 41:57.945
Damn right I know you. Let's see
how much there is in the titty bank.

42:00.250 --> 42:01.877
Hello, Mr. Green.

42:04.721 --> 42:06.518
Check out the snatch bank, too.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.456
Damn right I know you.

42:11.595 --> 42:14.723
I was gonna give it all to you,
but you didn't give me a chance.

42:14.798 --> 42:17.358
Bitch, you had your chance.
I was your last chance.

42:17.434 --> 42:19.800
Everybody else in town
threw your black ass out.

42:21.138 --> 42:21.968
Help me!

45:41.838 --> 45:44.773
Good day, sir.
Is this car registered to you?

45:45.208 --> 45:46.971
Yes, sir. This is my car.

45:47.711 --> 45:50.703
You must be new. You know who I am?

45:51.181 --> 45:54.048
I'll still have to see your license
and registration, sir.

45:54.117 --> 45:57.086
I believe you were speeding
coming across the bridge.

46:57.313 --> 46:58.177
Hi.

46:59.682 --> 47:00.546
Hi.

47:01.684 --> 47:02.776
What's your name?

47:02.986 --> 47:04.010
Sunny.

47:05.455 --> 47:09.721
I've been living here for six months now.
It's funny I've never met you before.

47:10.660 --> 47:12.560
Well, I work a lot.

47:12.896 --> 47:13.988
I know.

47:14.297 --> 47:17.198
- You're the cop who lives upstairs.
- That's right.

47:17.734 --> 47:19.361
Mind if I ask you a question?

47:20.103 --> 47:21.127
No, go ahead.

47:21.971 --> 47:24.439
What does a girl have to do
to go to bed with you?

47:30.780 --> 47:32.680
Try knocking on the door.

48:55.165 --> 48:56.496
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:58.401 --> 49:00.266
Do you always live in the dark?

49:00.336 --> 49:04.397
Well, you meet a better class of people
in the dark sometimes. Come on in.

49:09.579 --> 49:10.603
Sit down.

49:20.123 --> 49:23.422
Harry, this is Briggs. Are you alone?

49:23.493 --> 49:26.257
No, actually,
I'm entertaining a young lady friend.

49:26.563 --> 49:30.556
Put your pants back on, Callahan,
and come to the city morgue right away.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.227
The morgue? What the hell for, Briggs?

49:33.369 --> 49:36.395
I'm not on homicide anymore.
I'm a stake-out man now, remember?

49:36.806 --> 49:38.034
Not anymore, Callahan.

49:38.107 --> 49:40.371
You and your partner
are back on homicide.

49:40.743 --> 49:43.906
This is a little dramatic, isn't it, Briggs?
Not your usual style.

49:43.980 --> 49:45.538
It's meant to be, Callahan.

49:45.748 --> 49:48.979
This thing might be bigger
than even we think it is.

49:50.286 --> 49:52.186
Hijacking and gambling.

49:54.958 --> 49:55.982
Trucking.

49:59.862 --> 50:01.727
Narcotics and prostitution.

50:01.798 --> 50:03.390
This is the cream in the bottle.

50:03.466 --> 50:05.696
Someone wants
to put the courts out of business.

50:05.768 --> 50:07.998
So far, you've said nothing wrong.

50:08.071 --> 50:10.062
This one just came in an hour ago.

50:10.340 --> 50:13.309
Somebody wants it all.
This guy was just a pimp.

50:13.776 --> 50:15.266
That's one of his girls.

50:15.712 --> 50:17.077
How did she get it?

50:17.347 --> 50:21.511
Sometime before he got hit, he poured
a can of drain cleaner down her throat.

50:22.952 --> 50:25.147
That shows a certain sense of style.

50:25.989 --> 50:27.684
You're all heart, Callahan.

50:27.757 --> 50:30.351
Am I gonna have to have him
leaning over my shoulder?

50:30.426 --> 50:32.792
You work with Briggs on this, Callahan.

50:33.129 --> 50:37.327
But if you ever lean out of line, so help me,
I'll flop you lower than whale shit.

50:37.400 --> 50:40.233
Speaking of whale shit,
what have you turned up, Briggs?

50:40.303 --> 50:42.669
Nobody in my department
is sitting on their ass.

50:42.739 --> 50:44.764
See this thing, Callahan? The chief.

50:44.841 --> 50:47.469
He calls me on this all the time.
Even in the can.

50:47.543 --> 50:49.636
I haven't been out of my shoes
in 48 hours...

50:49.712 --> 50:52.272
...and still we have no witnesses, not one.

50:52.348 --> 50:55.579
In these cases, there's always
an officer right on top of the crime.

50:55.652 --> 50:57.483
But nobody's ever seen a thing.

50:58.521 --> 51:01.752
- Who was the officer on this one?
- A patrolman, Sweet.

51:01.858 --> 51:03.155
Wasn't it, Briggs?

51:03.426 --> 51:05.257
Sweet seems like a good man.

51:05.595 --> 51:08.530
I'll get on the ballistic reports
first thing in the morning.

51:08.598 --> 51:11.931
We ran all the slugs through ballistics.
We'll never see those guns.

51:12.001 --> 51:14.629
It was too professional,
you're wasting your time.

51:15.104 --> 51:16.935
Well, it takes me time, Briggs.

51:19.676 --> 51:21.940
A man has to know his limitations.

52:01.718 --> 52:02.878
Warm enough?

52:09.892 --> 52:11.120
You're my first cop.

52:15.298 --> 52:17.926
Guess that'll be two firsts tonight,
won't it?

52:56.072 --> 52:57.699
What do the others look like?

52:57.774 --> 53:00.140
The gun was a.357 Magnum.

53:00.510 --> 53:03.479
The other bullets are all too deformed
to do us any good.

53:03.546 --> 53:07.744
Hollow points, fired point-blank, you know.
We were lucky to get these two.

53:08.418 --> 53:10.716
I found them in the pimp's car.

53:11.154 --> 53:12.883
.357 Magnum?

53:15.425 --> 53:18.019
Maybe it's a cop. Maybe it's Harry.

53:18.594 --> 53:20.994
Nobody hates hoodlums
as much as he does.

53:24.634 --> 53:26.465
Whoever it is, he enjoys it.

53:27.003 --> 53:29.471
It's possible the man was dead
with the first shot.

53:29.539 --> 53:31.905
The others were thrown in
just for good measure.

53:31.974 --> 53:35.410
- He unloaded a whole magazine into him.
- One big mothering hole, huh?

53:38.414 --> 53:40.678
Well, everybody has to pay something.

53:42.351 --> 53:45.684
He would have to be standing right here,
this close...

53:46.155 --> 53:47.645
...point-blank range.

53:51.227 --> 53:54.458
The driver's license
and the $100 bill were out.

53:54.597 --> 53:57.293
Almost like he was showing it
to a traffic cop.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.424
Yeah.

53:59.168 --> 54:03.696
From what we have, it figures somebody
to be impersonating a police officer.

54:03.906 --> 54:06.636
On the cars, at least.
It's been done before.

54:07.643 --> 54:11.704
This close, it would have to be
somebody he would never recognize.

54:12.415 --> 54:14.042
Or never suspect.

54:18.287 --> 54:21.814
Lou Guzman, ex-meat lugger
with a first-grade education.

54:23.059 --> 54:26.324
He started working for the old boss
of bosses as a hitter.

54:27.263 --> 54:31.097
He controls narcotics state-wide,
and now dabbles in prostitution...

54:32.168 --> 54:35.331
...has big friends everywhere.
I want Casale and DiGiorgio on him.

54:35.404 --> 54:36.996
Next. Thank you.

54:38.040 --> 54:41.498
This one is for your special talents,
Callahan.

54:42.445 --> 54:43.912
Frank Palancio.

54:44.914 --> 54:46.882
Two hundred and twelve pounds.

54:47.917 --> 54:51.375
Indicted for murder 23 times,
no convictions.

54:52.488 --> 54:54.479
Complains about his health now.

54:54.957 --> 54:58.859
Suffers from ulcers, migraine headaches.
Dangerously violent.

55:00.396 --> 55:02.830
At one point,
he was Ricca's principle assassin.

55:02.899 --> 55:05.367
If you mix it with him, he won't back off.

55:06.035 --> 55:07.559
He's all yours, Callahan.

55:07.637 --> 55:10.299
That's very nice, Lieutenant,
but I don't think Palancio...

55:10.373 --> 55:12.204
I want you on him, Callahan.

55:12.308 --> 55:15.971
I'd bust Palancio for stepping
on a crack on the sidewalk if I could...

55:16.112 --> 55:19.707
...but this isn't his style.
Not the cars anyway, it's too direct.

55:19.982 --> 55:23.349
Callahan, you just keep your nose
pressed against Palancio's ass...

55:23.419 --> 55:26.855
...until I get a warrant
from the DA's office to bring him in.

55:26.923 --> 55:29.289
And I want the first conviction
on this animal.

55:29.625 --> 55:32.287
Conviction?
He's liable to be your next victim.

55:32.562 --> 55:34.723
What are you asking for, Lieutenant?

55:34.797 --> 55:40.064
I'm not asking you to follow him, Inspector.
For the last goddamn time, I'm telling you.

55:40.403 --> 55:41.301
Next.

55:43.039 --> 55:46.736
Nick Royale, Palancio's No. 1 hitter.

55:47.743 --> 55:49.370
He's had good training.

56:13.736 --> 56:15.067
What's happening?

56:15.204 --> 56:18.435
Nothing, just a lot of peeping and checking,
checking and peeping.

56:18.507 --> 56:21.704
I knew an old boy once
who used to keep pigs under his bed.

56:21.777 --> 56:23.608
Pigs? The eating kind?

56:23.679 --> 56:27.046
The eating kind.
Is all you ever think of your stomach?

56:33.656 --> 56:36.386
That's very interesting.
I think we better get going.

56:36.459 --> 56:37.323
Yeah.

57:59.742 --> 58:03.508
- They're splitting up. Which one, Harry?
- We'll stay with these two.

58:05.214 --> 58:07.944
Across the bridge,
it's out of our jurisdiction.

58:08.017 --> 58:09.348
Yeah.

58:13.589 --> 58:14.578
Well?

58:15.624 --> 58:16.921
Stick with the money.

58:39.415 --> 58:40.882
Pull over and stop.

58:56.465 --> 59:00.026
What are you trying to do?
He doesn't even know we're cops.

59:00.770 --> 59:04.069
He may panic, and besides,
we don't belong over here anyway.

59:04.874 --> 59:06.398
I hope he does panic.

59:08.377 --> 59:10.937
Then I'll get him for 23 other murders.

59:11.213 --> 59:12.976
And if he doesn't...

59:13.315 --> 59:16.512
...then I may be right about something
that's been nagging at me.

59:16.652 --> 59:18.347
I sure hope I'm not.

59:19.155 --> 59:20.179
What?

59:20.790 --> 59:23.258
I don't want to be winning bets
for anybody.

59:36.906 --> 59:39.204
Go a little faster, I'm on their side.

59:40.042 --> 59:42.840
- Roll down your window.
- What? Are you out of your mind?

59:42.912 --> 59:46.245
- I've never been wrong yet, have I?
- I don't know why I'm doing this.

59:46.438 --> 59:50.396
- Say, excuse me. Could you help us out?
- What do you want?

59:50.675 --> 59:53.109
Maybe you could help us,
we seem to be lost.

59:53.177 --> 59:56.738
We were looking for the entrance
to San Quentin. You know where that is?

59:56.814 --> 59:58.941
It's back there. Don't you see too good?

59:59.017 --> 01:00:03.044
Yeah, I see fine. I just wanted to know
whether you knew where San Quentin was.

01:00:03.254 --> 01:00:05.484
And you do, don't you, asshole.

01:00:12.997 --> 01:00:15.192
Get you yet, you son of a bitch.

01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:21.899
You always gotta do things your way,
don't you?

01:00:22.307 --> 01:00:24.502
No wonder Briggs stays on your tail.

01:00:26.477 --> 01:00:30.436
You do things someone else's way
and you take your life in your own hands.

01:00:50.868 --> 01:00:52.665
That son of a bitch Guzman!

01:00:53.972 --> 01:00:56.668
He hasn't gone out for almost
24 hours now.

01:01:23.334 --> 01:01:25.165
Hey, one of our guys took a spill.

01:01:26.637 --> 01:01:29.834
It's Charlie McCoy! Seems to be okay.

01:01:30.608 --> 01:01:32.075
Let me take a look.

01:01:33.478 --> 01:01:34.968
Yeah, he's okay.

01:01:45.957 --> 01:01:47.618
There he is.

01:01:48.593 --> 01:01:51.653
So, all you've got to do
is sit around all day, Guzman?

01:02:24.262 --> 01:02:26.196
This coke is out of sight!

01:02:26.364 --> 01:02:28.855
Oh, Guzman gets the best, baby.

01:02:29.934 --> 01:02:32.164
Oh, you bitch. Don't spill it.

01:02:32.603 --> 01:02:34.901
That stuff's worth $900 an ounce.

01:02:35.406 --> 01:02:36.839
You better not spill it.

01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:39.672
Don't get so uptight.

01:02:39.844 --> 01:02:43.746
Nobody says "don't" to me.
You understand? Nobody.

01:02:46.517 --> 01:02:48.212
I never touch the stuff.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:51.015
You want to put that over there now?

01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:18.305
Take over for me, will you, Ed?

01:03:45.776 --> 01:03:47.971
Damn, I wish something would happen.

01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:49.539
Take it easy.

01:03:49.947 --> 01:03:52.541
That's what stakeouts are all about.
Waiting.

01:05:11.395 --> 01:05:13.056
No, please! No!

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:20.630
Frank!

01:06:30.241 --> 01:06:33.335
- Just what the hell is going on?
- Somebody killed a cop.

01:06:33.411 --> 01:06:36.437
Folks, there's been a little trouble here.
Everyone stand back.

01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:38.448
Please, ma'am, move back.

01:06:41.352 --> 01:06:43.252
There's been some trouble.

01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:45.580
What happened?

01:06:47.024 --> 01:06:49.083
Everything seems to be all right, folks.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.491
What's going on?

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:54.495
Move it, people.

01:06:55.633 --> 01:06:57.328
Please, sir, stand back.

01:06:57.902 --> 01:06:59.130
Yes, sir.

01:07:00.771 --> 01:07:01.795
Yes, sir.

01:07:02.807 --> 01:07:05.241
No, sir. We won't let anything
out to the press.

01:07:06.744 --> 01:07:07.836
Yes, sir.

01:07:08.946 --> 01:07:12.177
You endangered an entire investigation
by trying to push something.

01:07:12.249 --> 01:07:14.183
Not to mention your own lives.

01:07:14.251 --> 01:07:16.412
You blew the whole Palancio stakeout.

01:07:16.487 --> 01:07:19.456
Instead of keeping him under surveillance
as I told you to...

01:07:19.857 --> 01:07:22.883
...you had to harass him.
What do you have to say about that?

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.552
What do I tell Avery? What?

01:07:27.798 --> 01:07:31.461
You tell him it's not Palancio.
You tell him it's a traffic cop.

01:07:33.337 --> 01:07:34.395
A cop?

01:07:34.472 --> 01:07:35.564
That's right.

01:07:35.673 --> 01:07:38.073
A traffic cop. Are you out of your mind?

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:42.411
Do you expect me to believe
that a traffic cop...

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.181
...is killing off all the top criminals
in the city? Who?

01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:52.252
It's Charlie McCoy.

01:07:53.324 --> 01:07:56.725
He's ready for the rubber gun squad.
He even tried to kill himself.

01:07:57.194 --> 01:07:58.456
Charlie McCoy.

01:08:02.566 --> 01:08:04.898
Guzman was hit today.

01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:09.463
A cop was killed. It was Charlie McCoy.

01:08:14.078 --> 01:08:15.909
- McCoy?
- Yes, Charlie McCoy.

01:08:16.947 --> 01:08:19.848
The only reason I don't bust you
into the bag this minute...

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:22.613
...is I know the two of you
were close friends.

01:08:23.287 --> 01:08:26.654
I was just about to call his wife.
Or you can, if you want to.

01:08:27.158 --> 01:08:28.420
I know he had kids.

01:08:29.527 --> 01:08:30.425
Yeah!

01:08:32.363 --> 01:08:34.558
- Who reported it?
- Davis.

01:08:34.765 --> 01:08:35.788
Davis?

01:08:35.933 --> 01:08:38.424
What happened
to the DiGiorgio stake-out team?

01:08:38.602 --> 01:08:42.504
It was an accidental coincidence.
Davis happened to be going by, it happens.

01:08:42.573 --> 01:08:44.700
McCoy was already dead
when he got there.

01:08:45.576 --> 01:08:46.667
Any witnesses?

01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:47.809
None.

01:08:51.081 --> 01:08:53.072
- I'll make that call.
- Go ahead.

01:08:54.018 --> 01:08:57.715
Harry, if it means anything coming
from me, I'm sorry about Charlie.

01:08:58.022 --> 01:08:59.956
But it's Palancio, believe me.

01:09:00.491 --> 01:09:03.926
I'll have a warrant in 48 hours.
You can pick him up.

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.358
He's all yours.

01:09:40.898 --> 01:09:43.024
Well, thank you for coming, Harry.

01:09:43.934 --> 01:09:45.731
You sure you have to leave?

01:09:47.004 --> 01:09:50.269
I won't have any place to go
for a sit-down dinner anymore.

01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:54.100
I never really did like it here very much.

01:09:55.546 --> 01:09:57.844
I always liked the change of seasons.

01:10:03.687 --> 01:10:06.952
I'm going to take him home. It's time.

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:10.025
It's time he went home.

01:10:15.566 --> 01:10:17.761
Come on, kids, let's get in the car.

01:10:27.344 --> 01:10:31.041
It was nice of that young man
to help us with the children.

01:10:33.817 --> 01:10:36.877
Goodbye, Harry. We'll all miss you.

01:10:37.955 --> 01:10:39.047
'Bye, doll.

01:10:46.196 --> 01:10:48.790
Take them
to the passenger terminal, please.

01:10:58.776 --> 01:11:02.007
It was nice of you to come out.
You didn't have to do that.

01:11:02.613 --> 01:11:05.275
If I'd have been there sooner,
he might still be alive.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:09.048
He didn't deserve to get it that way.

01:11:10.654 --> 01:11:12.645
If there's anything I can do...

01:11:13.991 --> 01:11:15.925
I feel responsible somehow.

01:11:44.888 --> 01:11:47.789
<i>The next shooter is Callahan.</i>
<i>Davis on deck.</i>

01:12:29.466 --> 01:12:32.833
You sure shot the pants off
of everybody with that score, Harry.

01:12:32.903 --> 01:12:34.803
I've never seen you smoother.

01:12:35.339 --> 01:12:37.899
By the way, I personally want to tell you...

01:12:37.975 --> 01:12:40.773
...how sorry I am
about what happened to Charlie.

01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:46.177
What I can't figure out, Frank,
is how that kid, Davis, got in there first.

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:48.548
You guys were right across the street.

01:12:48.852 --> 01:12:53.186
I don't have a goddamned idea, Harry.
The kid came out of nowhere.

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:57.052
We were in that garage
before you could spit.

01:12:57.461 --> 01:13:00.862
Maybe I'm slowing down in my old age
or something, I don't know.

01:13:01.598 --> 01:13:05.625
I want to be the first to congratulate you
on what I think will be the winning score.

01:13:05.703 --> 01:13:07.534
You shaded me by seven points.

01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:10.399
The only person now
who has a chance is Davis.

01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:17.408
Shoot 'em up!

01:13:53.784 --> 01:13:55.513
I think the kid beat you, Harry.

01:13:57.855 --> 01:13:58.981
It happens.

01:13:59.223 --> 01:14:01.987
<i>Harry, he edged you by four points.</i>

01:14:02.392 --> 01:14:04.860
<i>That evens it up on the overall champion.</i>

01:14:05.562 --> 01:14:07.553
<i>You have your choice in the shoot-off.</i>

01:14:08.198 --> 01:14:10.063
<i>Bull's eye or combat?</i>

01:14:13.403 --> 01:14:14.199
Combat.

01:14:59.716 --> 01:15:00.683
Out!

01:15:09.226 --> 01:15:11.626
<i>5:46 seconds. Score, perfect.</i>

01:15:13.297 --> 01:15:14.594
Good luck, sir.

01:15:54.705 --> 01:15:55.729
A good guy!

01:15:55.873 --> 01:15:57.465
That last one was a good guy!

01:16:10.687 --> 01:16:13.918
5:36 seconds.
But I'm sorry, Harry, you hit a good guy.

01:16:14.057 --> 01:16:16.423
You had a bad break.
I really don't deserve it.

01:16:16.526 --> 01:16:17.754
You won, didn't you?

01:16:17.828 --> 01:16:19.819
- I guess, but...
- That's all that matters.

01:16:19.897 --> 01:16:21.387
You mind if I try that one?

01:16:27.537 --> 01:16:29.630
Chester, how about six?

01:16:48.225 --> 01:16:50.750
Not bad. I seem to have lost the last one.

01:16:52.062 --> 01:16:53.962
You get used to it.

01:16:56.333 --> 01:16:58.358
I can see how you would, at that.

01:17:55.325 --> 01:17:58.419
You said five minutes
and I've been waiting for a half an hour.

01:17:58.495 --> 01:18:00.224
Don't you ever get hungry?

01:18:03.567 --> 01:18:07.162
- It just didn't seem like a half hour.
- Yeah, well it has been.

01:18:07.804 --> 01:18:10.898
I went over to my butcher's yesterday
and picked up some veal.

01:18:10.974 --> 01:18:15.308
Pops is really an artist, man. I could
watch that man cut meat all day long.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.739
Why don't you come home with me and...

01:18:18.815 --> 01:18:21.750
My wife's a good cook.
Have a little dinner with us.

01:18:28.091 --> 01:18:31.891
No, thanks. I just saw something
that killed my appetite.

01:18:40.234 --> 01:18:44.227
We'll catch those animals with their pants
down. I was going to call you at home.

01:18:44.305 --> 01:18:46.830
We got our search warrants
and multiple charges.

01:18:46.908 --> 01:18:49.604
We're going to make a city-wide raid
tomorrow morning.

01:18:49.677 --> 01:18:53.977
Palancio is yours.
Just don't take him out head-first, Harry.

01:18:54.482 --> 01:18:58.111
I think you'll find what I want to show you
in ballistics very interesting.

01:18:58.519 --> 01:19:01.886
You'll find more leads than you can
shake a stick at tomorrow morning.

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:08.553
- Good morning, Harry. Sir.
- Walter.

01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:10.893
Do you mind excusing us
for a few minutes?

01:19:10.965 --> 01:19:11.863
Sure.

01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:22.467
There's only two.

01:19:22.543 --> 01:19:25.637
- I wonder what happened to the others.
- Federal boys have them.

01:19:48.836 --> 01:19:49.530
Well?

01:19:50.338 --> 01:19:51.669
Take a look.

01:19:56.844 --> 01:19:58.505
Close, real close.

01:19:59.647 --> 01:20:02.616
But there's still a lot of lines
that don't match up.

01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:05.080
All this proves is that these two bullets...

01:20:05.152 --> 01:20:08.610
...came from barrels
with a similar twist and width of rifling.

01:20:08.956 --> 01:20:11.220
You don't think it would stand up
as evidence?

01:20:11.292 --> 01:20:12.782
As it is, no.

01:20:12.893 --> 01:20:15.760
But I'll have a full comparison report made,
no problem.

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:18.993
You're probably right.
Besides, it isn't necessary yet.

01:20:19.367 --> 01:20:20.800
What do you mean, "yet"?

01:20:21.469 --> 01:20:23.027
Where'd you get that slug?

01:20:23.104 --> 01:20:26.835
- I'd just as soon not say for the time being.
- Don't play games on this.

01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:28.533
Whose side are you on anyway?

01:20:28.609 --> 01:20:31.271
It's just a wild shot
and I'm probably wrong.

01:20:31.679 --> 01:20:34.170
I'd like to handle it my own way.

01:20:35.116 --> 01:20:38.643
By the way, I'd like to have Davis
and Sweet as my back-up squad tomorrow.

01:20:40.121 --> 01:20:41.918
They're just rookies for Christ's sake.

01:20:41.989 --> 01:20:45.823
You drum up somebody in the department
who can shoot as well and I'll use them.

01:20:45.893 --> 01:20:48.418
Goddamn it,
there isn't supposed to be any shooting.

01:20:49.063 --> 01:20:52.157
Besides, they don't have the experience yet
for a job like this.

01:20:52.266 --> 01:20:56.225
How the hell's a man supposed to get
experience if nobody gives him a chance?

01:20:56.303 --> 01:20:58.328
And Davis is the new pistol champion.

01:20:58.606 --> 01:21:00.574
Suppose they panic and start shooting?

01:21:02.943 --> 01:21:07.778
Nothing wrong with shooting,
as long as the right people get shot.

01:21:24.231 --> 01:21:26.893
- Let him know who you are and keep cool.
- Okay.

01:21:27.968 --> 01:21:30.562
I want you to keep an eye
on Davis and Sweet.

01:21:30.671 --> 01:21:31.695
What for?

01:21:31.939 --> 01:21:33.463
Just do it, will you?

01:21:35.309 --> 01:21:36.333
All right.

01:21:36.744 --> 01:21:38.678
- You all set?
- All set.

01:21:38.746 --> 01:21:40.441
We'll take off in three cars.

01:21:40.514 --> 01:21:43.176
Davis and Sweet will make the arrest.
Early will cover.

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:46.583
I'll be on the back at the pier
in case anybody makes a break for it.

01:21:46.654 --> 01:21:49.122
If there'll be trouble, that's where it'll start.

01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:52.523
We're holding the other squads back
until you've made your arrest.

01:21:52.593 --> 01:21:56.654
Yours is the most important, it'll be
the first. We don't want any foul-ups.

01:21:57.064 --> 01:21:58.554
- Right?
- Right.

01:22:00.568 --> 01:22:04.026
I'd never walk up to a door with Harry,
too many people don't like him.

01:22:04.505 --> 01:22:06.996
Thanks. I needed that.

01:22:10.611 --> 01:22:12.135
- You boys ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:12.213 --> 01:22:15.444
- Thank you for requesting us.
- Sir, we won't let you down.

01:22:15.516 --> 01:22:17.347
Well, I'm depending on that.

01:23:13.307 --> 01:23:14.274
Nickie.

01:23:24.952 --> 01:23:25.919
Yeah?

01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:30.450
Who is this?

01:23:37.364 --> 01:23:38.695
What was that, Nickie?

01:23:42.403 --> 01:23:46.134
Somebody said we'll be hit in two minutes.
They'll be dressed like cops.

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:50.036
Did it sound like anybody you know?

01:23:50.611 --> 01:23:52.101
No, I couldn't tell.

01:24:07.962 --> 01:24:09.691
Ed, Chuck...

01:24:12.733 --> 01:24:14.462
...get over to the windows.

01:24:18.205 --> 01:24:19.502
I got the water side.

01:24:19.573 --> 01:24:21.700
I'll take the street side.

01:24:21.942 --> 01:24:24.069
If they are cops, this could be a set-up.

01:24:24.144 --> 01:24:27.136
After the holes they put in Ricca
you want me to wait and see?

01:24:27.214 --> 01:24:29.205
If they're cops, they'll have papers.

01:24:29.283 --> 01:24:30.614
Car coming, Frank.

01:24:31.452 --> 01:24:33.352
There's a big guy out there.

01:24:37.258 --> 01:24:39.385
- He got a uniform on?
- No.

01:24:40.995 --> 01:24:44.294
He ain't no cop.
Cops always come in the front door.

01:24:44.798 --> 01:24:45.924
Another car.

01:24:46.934 --> 01:24:49.402
Why didn't they come in squad cars
if they're cops?

01:24:49.503 --> 01:24:52.370
That big guy's working himself around
by those containers.

01:24:54.308 --> 01:24:55.775
He's got a gun out.

01:24:56.677 --> 01:24:57.905
Two uniforms in it.

01:24:59.246 --> 01:25:00.941
That ain't no cop's gun, Frank.

01:25:06.553 --> 01:25:09.249
There's a cop in uniform coming up
to the door.

01:25:15.329 --> 01:25:17.854
We aren't open. Come back tomorrow.

01:25:18.565 --> 01:25:21.329
Police officers,
we'd like to ask you some questions.

01:25:21.402 --> 01:25:23.734
Yeah, I'm just a watchman. Nobody's here.

01:25:23.971 --> 01:25:25.905
We're looking for Mr. Frank Palancio.

01:25:25.973 --> 01:25:28.806
Would you open the door?
We have a warrant for his arrest.

01:25:28.909 --> 01:25:30.706
I said nobody's here, goddamn it!

01:25:30.778 --> 01:25:33.042
We have warrants
for a search of the premises.

01:25:33.113 --> 01:25:34.011
Serve them!

01:25:49.530 --> 01:25:51.998
They got Sweet! Send some help! Quick!

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.006
<i>Cease firing.</i>

01:26:41.081 --> 01:26:44.482
<i>Throw your weapons out and come out</i>
<i>with your hands behind your heads.</i>

01:26:44.551 --> 01:26:46.280
- Bullshit!
- Fuck you!

01:28:45.939 --> 01:28:50.069
You sure you don't want a local for this?
Takes about seven stitches.

01:28:50.144 --> 01:28:51.270
No, thanks.

01:28:53.013 --> 01:28:54.776
Okay, it's your ass.

01:28:56.083 --> 01:28:58.108
My head, cut's on my head.

01:28:59.786 --> 01:29:02.812
Why does everybody suddenly
become a comedian in here?

01:29:03.123 --> 01:29:05.023
Does he have to stay in here?

01:29:05.859 --> 01:29:10.091
No, I could stop and let the man's
brains run out all over his shoes.

01:29:10.564 --> 01:29:14.056
Rogers, I don't need to have a doctor
display that kind of attitude.

01:29:14.134 --> 01:29:15.863
A police officer is dead.

01:29:16.803 --> 01:29:17.770
Sorry.

01:29:19.506 --> 01:29:22.566
I got those warrants
for a search of the premises, Callahan...

01:29:22.643 --> 01:29:25.612
...not for you to become
judge, jury and executioner.

01:29:25.712 --> 01:29:27.680
It was supposed to be a simple arrest.

01:29:29.016 --> 01:29:32.349
Arresting a killer like Palancio
isn't always simple.

01:29:32.553 --> 01:29:34.316
People are guilty until proven...

01:29:34.421 --> 01:29:35.251
I mean...

01:29:36.657 --> 01:29:38.454
Goddamn it, you know what I mean.

01:29:38.892 --> 01:29:41.952
The city's on the edge
of the worst violence in its history...

01:29:42.029 --> 01:29:44.759
...and you have to start
full-scale military operations.

01:29:44.831 --> 01:29:48.289
I didn't start shooting at anyone
who didn't start shooting at me first.

01:29:48.368 --> 01:29:52.634
Each time you pull out that gun,
my paperwork backs up for three months.

01:29:53.006 --> 01:29:55.770
The chief and I have already
conferred on this matter.

01:29:55.842 --> 01:29:58.140
A full investigation is warranted here.

01:30:03.283 --> 01:30:04.910
What about a dead cop?

01:30:06.186 --> 01:30:09.883
- I warned you against taking them.
- Sweet was killed with the first shot.

01:30:10.157 --> 01:30:14.059
Besides they were tipped off.
They knew we were coming, Briggs.

01:30:14.394 --> 01:30:16.726
How? Don't hand me that crap.

01:30:17.397 --> 01:30:20.798
They knew we were coming.
After 200 arrests, I know the difference.

01:30:22.436 --> 01:30:26.429
If I have my way, Callahan, you won't make
another arrest as long as you live.

01:30:28.742 --> 01:30:30.175
Is that all, Lieutenant?

01:30:31.078 --> 01:30:32.978
No, that's not all.

01:30:34.514 --> 01:30:36.209
I want that slug you showed me.

01:30:38.352 --> 01:30:42.254
I ran that through ballistics, it was nothing.
The rifling was totally different.

01:30:42.322 --> 01:30:44.950
It's still State's evidence.
I want it anyway.

01:30:49.963 --> 01:30:50.952
Eat it.

01:31:13.153 --> 01:31:18.181
Look, Harry, if it means anything,
I think you got the wrong end of the stick.

01:31:18.258 --> 01:31:19.987
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.321
What did they find when they got in there?

01:31:22.462 --> 01:31:25.920
Nothing. Palancio was as clean
as he could possibly be.

01:31:26.633 --> 01:31:28.726
They knew we were coming, Harry.

01:31:28.969 --> 01:31:31.233
Why do you figure they opened up on us?

01:31:31.672 --> 01:31:34.607
They must've thought
it was a set-up like the others.

01:31:35.008 --> 01:31:36.999
- It was.
- No.

01:31:38.378 --> 01:31:40.005
It was a set-up, Early.

01:31:41.682 --> 01:31:46.051
What I'll lay on you seems so far-fetched,
I can't even believe it myself.

01:31:47.054 --> 01:31:50.285
I gave up being surprised
working with you anyway.

01:31:51.191 --> 01:31:53.455
Would you be surprised if I told you...

01:31:53.527 --> 01:31:57.520
...a bunch of rookie cops were the ones
who were doing all the killing?

01:31:58.832 --> 01:31:59.799
See this?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.730
I gave Briggs a phony for the time being.

01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:05.804
This is a bullet I took out
of the target range.

01:32:05.872 --> 01:32:07.840
It came from Davis' gun.

01:32:08.008 --> 01:32:11.375
It matches up with the one
taken out of Charlie McCoy's body.

01:32:11.945 --> 01:32:13.845
Davis? That's insane.

01:32:14.314 --> 01:32:17.772
Maybe so, but somebody tipped-off
Palancio that we were coming.

01:32:17.984 --> 01:32:21.943
Wanting me killed or Palancio
or hopefully both.

01:32:22.456 --> 01:32:25.823
Yeah, but Sweet died today.

01:32:26.293 --> 01:32:28.090
Sweet was sacrificed.

01:32:29.496 --> 01:32:32.522
What's more important if I'm right,
I'll be sacrificed.

01:32:32.599 --> 01:32:36.160
They've gotta figure I told you,
which means you'll be sacrificed.

01:32:38.905 --> 01:32:40.065
Yeah.

01:32:41.508 --> 01:32:45.638
If anything happens to me,
I want you to give that to Lt. Briggs.

01:32:45.712 --> 01:32:46.736
Okay.

01:32:46.813 --> 01:32:48.678
What happens if they get us both?

01:32:49.349 --> 01:32:50.373
Then they win.

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.086
It's not hard to understand
how this could happen, the way things are.

01:32:57.224 --> 01:33:01.285
As incredible as it seems, there may be
a sub-organization within the police force.

01:33:01.361 --> 01:33:05.127
Sort of a death squad
like they had in Brazil some years back.

01:33:06.333 --> 01:33:07.265
Damn.

01:33:09.102 --> 01:33:13.505
Some nights I wake up, wonder
where the hell the world's going to.

01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:19.335
I want you to take care of yourself,
you understand?

01:33:52.045 --> 01:33:52.875
Hi!

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.304
Hi.

01:33:55.115 --> 01:33:57.015
Jesus, what happened to your face?

01:33:57.617 --> 01:33:59.551
Nothing, just a few stitches.

01:34:01.521 --> 01:34:05.082
I was going to the market,
how about if I bring back a few beers?

01:34:05.492 --> 01:34:07.960
Good, I could use a beer right about now.

01:34:08.094 --> 01:34:10.426
I've got your key, so I'll get your mail, too.

01:34:10.564 --> 01:34:11.724
All right, baby.

01:34:12.232 --> 01:34:13.460
Keep it warm.

01:34:38.658 --> 01:34:41.718
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to prosecute a cop?

01:34:59.913 --> 01:35:02.677
You heroes have killed
a dozen people this week.

01:35:04.451 --> 01:35:06.442
What are you gonna do next week?

01:35:09.289 --> 01:35:10.756
Kill a dozen more.

01:35:12.225 --> 01:35:14.716
Is that what you guys are all about,
being heroes?

01:35:15.095 --> 01:35:16.528
All our heroes are dead.

01:35:16.963 --> 01:35:18.794
We are the first generation...

01:35:19.165 --> 01:35:20.962
...that's learned to fight.

01:35:21.568 --> 01:35:24.696
We're simply ridding society
of killers that would be caught...

01:35:24.771 --> 01:35:27.831
...and sentenced anyway
if our courts worked properly.

01:35:29.509 --> 01:35:32.945
We began with the criminals
that the people know...

01:35:34.548 --> 01:35:37.244
...so that our actions would be understood.

01:35:38.485 --> 01:35:42.182
It's not just a question
of whether or not to use violence.

01:35:43.957 --> 01:35:46.357
There simply is no other way, Inspector.

01:35:47.694 --> 01:35:49.184
You of all people...

01:35:50.063 --> 01:35:51.792
...should understand that.

01:35:54.935 --> 01:35:57.426
Either you're for us or you're against us.

01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:05.901
I'm afraid you've misjudged me.

01:38:09.135 --> 01:38:10.625
- Hi, Sunny.
- Hi, Sue.

01:38:17.911 --> 01:38:19.105
No, no!

01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:22.712
Harry, what are you doing?

01:38:29.789 --> 01:38:31.689
Hey, what's going on down here?

01:38:32.058 --> 01:38:34.720
I'm taking the mailbox apart,
what does it look like?

01:38:34.794 --> 01:38:37.160
- You people live here, don't you?
- Yeah.

01:38:38.031 --> 01:38:41.023
What are you doing to the mailbox?
Did you lose you key?

01:38:41.101 --> 01:38:43.501
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business.

01:38:44.437 --> 01:38:47.565
That's my mailbox, too.
Don't you get smart with me!

01:38:48.942 --> 01:38:51.240
Tampering with the mail
is a federal offense.

01:38:51.511 --> 01:38:53.138
I'm calling the police.

01:38:54.047 --> 01:38:55.275
I am the police.

01:38:56.916 --> 01:38:57.814
What?

01:39:00.086 --> 01:39:01.610
The cop that lives upstairs?

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:21.507
What's that?

01:39:23.576 --> 01:39:24.975
Plastic explosive.

01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.204
A bomb?

01:39:28.782 --> 01:39:29.771
That's right.

01:39:29.849 --> 01:39:33.114
If you'd bothered me any more,
we'd all be stuck to the ceiling.

01:39:33.186 --> 01:39:36.349
- Do you want to hold it?
- No. I don't want to get involved.

01:39:39.325 --> 01:39:42.317
Go to your apartment and stay there.
Don't open for anybody.

01:41:13.853 --> 01:41:17.220
Homicide, Lt. Briggs,
Inspector Callahan calling.

01:41:20.159 --> 01:41:22.024
Callahan, where are you?

01:41:22.395 --> 01:41:24.886
Look, Briggs,
I just found a bomb in my mailbox.

01:41:24.964 --> 01:41:27.762
I want you to get a man
over to Early's house right away.

01:41:28.134 --> 01:41:28.930
What?

01:41:29.002 --> 01:41:30.970
I've got a bomb right here!

01:41:31.104 --> 01:41:33.265
Now get a man over to Early's,
you hear me?

01:41:34.007 --> 01:41:35.031
Right.

01:41:35.909 --> 01:41:38.571
Stay right where you are.
I'll be down there myself.

01:41:38.645 --> 01:41:39.737
Don't move.

01:42:22.755 --> 01:42:23.744
Yeah?

01:42:33.166 --> 01:42:34.292
Come on in.

01:42:37.136 --> 01:42:39.161
I don't like looking down one of those.

01:42:42.608 --> 01:42:43.973
Where's the bomb?

01:42:44.944 --> 01:42:46.468
Right on the dresser.

01:42:49.215 --> 01:42:52.878
All right. Let's get out of here.

01:42:53.886 --> 01:42:55.615
Avery will want to see this.

01:43:06.366 --> 01:43:09.529
You mind driving?
I want to take a closer look at this thing.

01:43:31.891 --> 01:43:34.758
This thing could be activated
by your mailbox key.

01:43:36.095 --> 01:43:37.357
Or by a timer.

01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:42.465
Turn right, here.

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.707
Get on the freeway.

01:43:49.909 --> 01:43:51.137
The freeway?

01:43:52.278 --> 01:43:54.644
You got a new route to city hall,
Lieutenant?

01:44:02.622 --> 01:44:06.217
Your gun's out of its holster, Briggs.
First time?

01:44:06.459 --> 01:44:08.620
You know you're not going to city hall.

01:44:08.694 --> 01:44:11.754
The only way you're going anywhere
is in a rubber bag.

01:44:12.498 --> 01:44:13.760
Let me have your gun.

01:44:33.686 --> 01:44:34.983
Now the shells.

01:44:39.325 --> 01:44:41.919
Three. You always carry three.

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.029
Throw them out the window.

01:44:55.174 --> 01:44:57.768
How do you figure on pulling this off,
Briggs?

01:44:57.844 --> 01:45:01.610
I run the investigation, with your record,
I can make anything stick.

01:45:02.849 --> 01:45:05.511
What I can't understand is,
why you of all people?

01:45:05.651 --> 01:45:08.586
A hundred years ago in this city,
people did the same thing.

01:45:08.654 --> 01:45:11.623
History justified the vigilantes,
we're no different.

01:45:12.058 --> 01:45:15.619
Anyone who threatens the security
of the people will be executed.

01:45:16.129 --> 01:45:20.498
- Evil for evil, Harry. Retribution.
- That's just fine.

01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.097
But how does murder fit in?

01:45:23.769 --> 01:45:26.431
When police start becoming
their own executioners...

01:45:26.506 --> 01:45:28.599
...where's it gonna end, Briggs?

01:45:29.275 --> 01:45:32.267
Pretty soon, you'll start executing people
for jaywalking.

01:45:32.345 --> 01:45:34.939
And executing people for traffic violations.

01:45:35.314 --> 01:45:39.375
Then you end up executing your neighbor
'cause his dog pisses on your lawn.

01:45:39.986 --> 01:45:43.649
There isn't one man we've killed that
didn't deserve what was coming to him.

01:45:43.723 --> 01:45:46.021
Yes, there is. Charlie McCoy.

01:45:46.459 --> 01:45:47.983
What would you have done?

01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:49.584
I'd have upheld the law.

01:45:49.662 --> 01:45:51.994
What the hell do you know about the law?

01:45:52.064 --> 01:45:53.793
You're a great cop, Harry.

01:45:54.033 --> 01:45:57.525
You had a chance to join the team,
but you'd rather stick to the system.

01:45:57.603 --> 01:46:01.164
Briggs, I hate the goddamn system.
But until someone comes along...

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:04.038
...with some changes that make sense,
I'll stick with it.

01:46:04.710 --> 01:46:06.701
You're about to become extinct.

01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:13.079
Get off at the next exit.

01:55:18.063 --> 01:55:18.927
Red?

01:55:49.828 --> 01:55:50.692
Red?

01:58:10.369 --> 01:58:14.169
Briggs was right.
You guys don't have enough experience.

01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:57.141
Just hold it right there, Callahan.

01:58:58.951 --> 01:59:00.043
No tricks.

01:59:11.997 --> 01:59:13.931
Your organization's through, Briggs.

01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:18.298
There's a lot more where they came from,
believe me.

01:59:18.437 --> 01:59:21.736
Move out of the way. Move it!

01:59:49.735 --> 01:59:51.032
Uphold the law.

01:59:53.705 --> 01:59:56.697
You just killed three police officers, Harry.

02:00:01.113 --> 02:00:03.707
And the only reason
I'm not gonna kill you...

02:00:04.249 --> 02:00:07.309
...is because I'm gonna prosecute you
with your own system.

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:17.551
It'll be my word against yours.

02:00:19.131 --> 02:00:20.962
And who's gonna believe you?

02:00:21.933 --> 02:00:25.198
You're a killer, Harry. A maniac!

02:01:21.893 --> 02:01:24.225
A man's got to know his limitations.

02:01:25.305 --> 02:01:31.214
