<i>Business as usual.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:21.988
Shame about your front.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.865
Don't play games.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.322
I thought it best
to meet here.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.408
Neutral ground.

00:35.786 --> 00:36.787
So, where are we
on payment of your debt?

00:36.954 --> 00:37.830
I need some time.

00:37.996 --> 00:38.918
But soon.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.003
I give you my word.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.337
If I dealt in "words,"

00:41.500 --> 00:42.717
I'd have been out
of the business years ago.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.970
You're mistaking me
for some two-bit gambler.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.505
All gamblers are the same.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.887
You're the highest risk
I've ever known

00:50.050 --> 00:52.348
because you really
are a man

00:52.511 --> 00:54.605
who doesn't know how
or when to stop.

00:54.763 --> 00:55.685
You'll get your money.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.528
I would have come
to a reasonable arrangement,

01:01.687 --> 01:02.813
but you weren't listening.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.529
Now I want the payment
in full,

01:05.691 --> 01:08.160
plus half
for the inconvenience,

01:08.318 --> 01:10.446

McNeish called,

02:04.374 --> 02:05.842

02:06.001 --> 02:07.674
I'm so sorry,
Mr. Selfridge.

02:07.836 --> 02:08.711
Who would do such a thing?

02:08.878 --> 02:11.473
Vandalism, most probably.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.885
Mr. Crabb, I need to borrow
from the company.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.223
Can you arrange it?

After the expense of France,

I had no choice,
Mr. Selfridge.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.124
No, I understand.

02:42.287 --> 02:46.292
If the funds are needed
for further expansion

or the long-term benefit
of the company...

Mr. Towler, increase
nighttime security.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.349
Thank you very much, Inspector.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.728
Hooligans might do one window.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.016
This attack had to be
well coordinated.

Inspector McNeish
has got a good point,

03:45.767 --> 03:47.019
Mr. Selfridge.

You would have had to know
what you were doing

03:48.770 --> 03:49.646
to smash glass that thick.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.030
We'll appeal
for witnesses.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.736
Mr. Towler will liaise
closely with you,

03:52.899 --> 03:53.775
Inspector.

I want this buried.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.283
Over and buried.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.869
Publicity will only lead
to a frenzy of speculation.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.203

the perpetrators.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.442
If you could just focus
on the provincial stores.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.069
Look at the figures
for Cambridge.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.276
The figures for Sheffield.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.032
They're worse than
hopeless, Gordon.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.943
The families running
those stores need time

04:36.109 --> 04:37.611
to make the new injections
of cash work for them.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.746
Don't take an attack
on the store out on me, Father.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.158
That's not fair.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.577
You're right.

04:44.743 --> 04:48.293
I'm sorry.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.630
You've had a huge shock.

04:52.793 --> 04:58.141
I'll stick around for
a few days to help out.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.392
I'll leave you to it.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.018

05:12.020 --> 05:13.772
To cut a long story short,
this Saturday,

05:13.939 --> 05:16.692
Josie and I will be
getting married.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.030

05:21.988 --> 05:24.241
What wonderful news.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.035
But goodness, this Saturday
doesn't give you much time.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.380
I meant...

05:30.539 --> 05:31.415
I know.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.083
I know what you meant.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.299
Things have to be hurried now.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.757
Which is why
I must apologize

05:40.924 --> 05:44.474
for not giving you
more notice...

05:44.636 --> 05:45.853
I'll be there with Mildred,
of course I will.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.312
...to be my best man, Arthur.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.942
Would you do me that honor?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.063
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.447
MAE: Right, ladies, let's
start our brochure shoot

06:00.610 --> 06:02.533
with my exclusive
summer collection.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.572
Thank you.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.456
And make sure you stress
"exclusive"

06:05.615 --> 06:07.538
in the brochure editorial.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.668
Right, let's see
what you've done

06:08.827 --> 06:11.250
with this bar area.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.836
We've got champagne on ice,
we've got crystal glasses,

06:13.999 --> 06:16.172
we've got the silver ashtray.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.757
You wanted the look
of the private club.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.139

Colleands as promised.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.353
No extra charge
for delivery.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.639
And where do you think
you're going?

06:32.350 --> 06:33.693
How can I help?

06:35.562 --> 06:37.485
I'll be straight with you,
Jimmy.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.366
I'm in a terrible mess.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.698
The windows were broken
by D'Ancona, my gaming agent.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.283
Right.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.538
You owe him money.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.368
A huge amount.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.283
Which I don't have.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.498
Harry, you know I'd help,

06:50.660 --> 06:52.788
but I'm just on the brink
of a deal right now.

06:52.954 --> 06:53.876
Give me a month.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.133
I don't have a month.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.795
I'm to pay 75,000 pounds,
due Monday.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.216
What about assets?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.226
Everything's leased--
cars, houses.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.104
I can't borrow another penny
from the store.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.185
Okay.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.142
No,no,no,no,no.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.561
This is silly.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.024
<i>There's accessible funds</i>

07:17.187 --> 07:18.939
spread out across
the Selfridge Holdings.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.278
Let me take a look,
see what I can come up with.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.159
Harry, that's the Jimmy magic:

07:23.318 --> 07:27.448
moving funds from one sector
of a company to fund another.

07:27.614 --> 07:31.369
Come on, Harry, we understand
the ups and downs of business.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.286
The thing is,
this isn't about business.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.547
This is about me.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.174
All the more reason to come up
with a solution, then.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.298
Leave it with me.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.843
A little bit more celebration,
girls.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.054
Smiles, glasses higher.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.844
A little bit more.

07:49.010 --> 07:49.932
Perfect.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.312
(flashbulb clicks)

07:51.471 --> 07:54.350
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.813
Oh, stop it.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.399
It'll be fun reliving
your Palm Court days.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.405
You just weren't always
so well dressed.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.907
I wasn't always dressed.

08:03.066 --> 08:03.942
I remember.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.577
So do I.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.456
How times have changed.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.366
I was a lady then.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.001
(laughs)

08:13.159 --> 08:15.253
And now you're
Lord of London nights,

08:15.412 --> 08:17.289
and I'm a...

08:17.455 --> 08:19.423
You'll always be
Lady Mae to me.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.544
We're not late, are we?

08:24.045 --> 08:24.967
Oh, good lord, no.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.390
(clears throat)

08:36.558 --> 08:37.683
(knocking)

08:37.851 --> 08:39.102
Yes?

08:40.687 --> 08:42.563
Hello.

08:42.731 --> 08:43.857
Hello.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.026
You surviving the shock
of the broken windows?

08:46.192 --> 08:49.162
I must be--
I'm being measured for a suit.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.368
A special event?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.875
None more special.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.287
I'd better get a dress then,
hadn't I?

08:56.453 --> 09:00.299
Have you spoken
to Mr. Selfridge yet?

09:00.457 --> 09:02.004
Not yet.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.419
I will.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.337
Later today.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.425
All right.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.805
Mind if I join you?

09:14.971 --> 09:16.894
I'm not sure I mind
what you do, Frank.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.480
You don't mean that.

09:22.937 --> 09:26.612
I gave up the career opportunity
of a lifetime--

09:26.775 --> 09:27.947
several lifetimes--

09:28.109 --> 09:29.201
for you, Frank,
and what did you give me'?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.236
A cheap affair.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.655
It's wasn't an affair.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.663
Even cheaper.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.823
It meant nothing.

09:33.990 --> 09:34.866
To you.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.535
Don't speak for me.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.213
Men do foolish things.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.502
That's your excuse?

09:45.668 --> 09:46.544
That's it?

09:49.172 --> 09:50.924
You must think
so little of me.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.265
So little of all
our years together.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.475
Kitty, it was a mad trip.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.890
There was lots
of drink and...

09:58.056 --> 09:58.978
Don't.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.859
You let me down.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.149
You let us down.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.737
And I can't forget that.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.780
What does that mean?

10:12.946 --> 10:15.244
I want you out of the house
by this evening.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.784
On, Kitty!

10:17.951 --> 10:18.622
Kitty?

10:18.785 --> 10:19.627
Sis?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.835
Frank, what's happened?

10:25.083 --> 10:27.461
That one's going to be
in Madam Rennard's new brochure.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.719
Oh!

10:28.878 --> 10:30.505
It's never been done
in this country before.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.050
She's seen them in Paris.

10:33.216 --> 10:34.889
Imagine that--

10:35.051 --> 10:36.678
a whole brochure
just about her ready to wear.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.347
It suits you.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.435
Mm...

10:40.640 --> 10:43.769
Not in pink.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.029
Do you have anything
in cream?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.279
We can have it made up.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.985
That's the point:

10:49.149 --> 10:52.198
who you are
and who you want to be.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.658
You love this job, don't you?

10:54.821 --> 10:58.746
I suppose it's not
very important.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.660
Not in the grand scheme of...

11:00.827 --> 11:03.171
No, but work
sees you through a lot.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.629
I know just the person
to make this dress.

11:06.791 --> 11:07.633
(flashbulb clicks)

11:07.792 --> 11:08.714
Got it.

11:08.877 --> 11:09.924
Right, let's move on.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.556
How's my favorite girl?

11:13.715 --> 11:14.637
Grandpa!

11:16.217 --> 11:17.639
You say that to Mommy too.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.475
Well, I say it
to all my favorite girls.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.935
How many of us are there?

11:23.641 --> 11:24.733
I keep wanting to say,

11:24.893 --> 11:26.816
"Would sir like
some coffee now?"

11:26.978 --> 11:28.525
Or pour someone
some sherry or something.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.564
How you doing, Harry?

11:29.731 --> 11:31.108
Good to see you.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.948
He is the authentic touch
that I need for my club scene.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.158
You won't find anything
more authentic than me.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.365
Harry.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.626
Oh, excuse me.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.054
It's staring you
in the face, Harry.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.307
Sell the non-profitable
provincial stores.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.263
The buildings are worth far more
than the businesses.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.597
I know investors

11:58.760 --> 12:00.307
who would leap at the chance
to own those properties.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.393
I could get the money
for you tomorrow

12:02.555 --> 12:03.431
on your promissory notes.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.067
Come on, Harry,
think about it.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.775
In your bank account
by close of day tomorrow.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.076
That would break Gordon's heart.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.588
Have you seen this?

12:27.747 --> 12:28.999
Today's late edition.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.542
It says the windows
were your fault.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.710
I've got it under control.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.302
Were we attacked because
of your personal gambling debts?

12:36.464 --> 12:38.558
This needn't concern you,
Gordon.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.593
I have a right to know
what's going on around here!

12:40.760 --> 12:42.433
Just because I'm not here
every day

12:42.595 --> 12:43.642
doesn't mean you
can shut me out.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.899
Not today, Gordon, please.

12:46.057 --> 12:46.979
Not today.

12:51.187 --> 12:54.487
Baby soft skin
in the morning, madam.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.026
CONNIE:
I want to strangle Frank!

12:56.192 --> 12:57.409
Can't talk about it now, Connie.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.615
If George did that to me...

12:58.778 --> 13:00.325
George never would.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.662
That's the difference.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.044
Are you really throwing him
out of the house?

13:06.202 --> 13:09.502
I'd never be able
to trust him again.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.291
I can't live like that.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.458
I won't.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.551
My father
and Miss Mardle

13:17.714 --> 13:18.681
are getting married.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.177
It's really short notice,

13:22.343 --> 13:24.016
but I was hoping
Miss Brockless

13:24.178 --> 13:25.430
could do her dress.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.190
I'm already a woman short.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.601
I can't afford
for Miss Brockless

13:29.767 --> 13:31.769
to fall behind in her workload.

13:31.936 --> 13:37.238
I'm sure my father would greatly
appreciate it, Miss Ellis.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.994
Miss Mardle's

13:41.154 --> 13:42.497
already selected
material.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.543
Ready, Miss Brockless?

13:49.912 --> 13:52.006
Well, off you go.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.384
They haven't got all day
to wait for the likes of you.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.762
No, thanks.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.108
A story about the broken window
was one thing,

14:11.267 --> 14:12.735
but Why'd you have
to make it personal?

14:12.894 --> 14:14.146
We didn't write
about your family.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.188
We wrote about you.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.610
You said yourself
you chose this life.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.824
Now, don't blame me

14:21.986 --> 14:24.330
if my reporter digs deep
and finds dirt.

14:24.489 --> 14:28.585
If she got it wrong,
I'll print another retraction.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.214
You're never gonna stop,
are you?

14:36.959 --> 14:38.302
I can't do business
with turncoats.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.509
What's that supposed to mean?

14:40.671 --> 14:41.888
I'm pulling every advertisement.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.971
You'll never see a penny again
from Selfridge's.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.636
You've made idle threats before.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.352
There is nothing idle
about that threat.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.185
You'll regret it, sir.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.022
Gorgeous.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.533
Right, last shot.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.943
VICTOR: Better do as she says,
ladies, she's a bossy one.

15:02.110 --> 15:02.986
I have the Royal Box

15:03.152 --> 15:05.154
at the opera
Friday night.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.823
The Prince of Wales
loathes the opera.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.411
If you could bear
the company

15:08.574 --> 15:10.497
of his bore
of a private secretary.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.288
I can bear the company of anyone
for the opera.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.374
Wonderful.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.294
Mr. Colleano,
you are a natural.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.303
Done, done.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.056
Mae, we can swing by Collean0's
afterwards.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.263
A little more down to earth.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.270
All right, we'll do that.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.181
Victor,
you can get changed.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.315
The next tableau
is just the ladies.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.276
HARRY: I need those numbers as
soon as possible, Mr. Crabb.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.296
Chief, there's something
I need to tell you.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.929
I've made my peace with it now,
chief.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.512
We're keeping it
in the family:

16:10.678 --> 16:11.554
Mr. Crabb and you,

16:11.721 --> 16:12.973
for the present.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.567
Roger...

16:16.726 --> 16:18.694
ls there anything
that I can do?

16:18.853 --> 16:19.820
Anything at all?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.653
I have Miss Mardle
back in my life.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.780
I have no choice in dying,

16:25.943 --> 16:30.574
which makes the other choices
all the more important.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.959
In the end, it's about family

16:33.117 --> 16:34.994
and the love
we take with us.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.930
There must be something
that I can do.

16:52.178 --> 16:57.776
Well, Josie needs someone
to give her away.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.858
Obviously, I can't.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.988
I would be honored.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.609
Thank you, chief.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.298
Look at mommy
and smile, Tatiana.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.842
Right.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.430
So just relax.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.560
Pretend that you're at home

17:33.719 --> 17:35.346
and you're sat with your mommy
by the fire

17:35.513 --> 17:38.357
and you're going to read
this lovely book together.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.438
All right?

17:49.485 --> 17:49.986
Perfect.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.074
Done.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.912
It's just like the old days,
you know?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.077
When I used to work here.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.464
Just let someone else carry
the strain of owning the place.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.125
Are you not enjoying running
the club anymore, Victor?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.087
You sleep in the day,
you work in the night.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.847
You never really get the time
to think

18:10.006 --> 18:11.053
if you're enjoying it or not.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.558
Well, you should make time.

18:14.302 --> 18:17.476
Part of the fun's
being here with you.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.560
Can I say that?

18:18.723 --> 18:20.475
You just did.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.027
PHOTOGRAPHER:
And smile.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.157
(knocking)

18:32.069 --> 18:35.699
Sorry to interrupt your evening,
Mrs. Selfridge.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.333
I was hoping to catch a word
with Mr. Gordon

18:37.491 --> 18:38.868
before he returns
to Sheffield.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.504
He's decided to stay
for a few days, as it happens.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.585
Please, come in.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.386
I thought it best

18:49.545 --> 18:51.468
to call on you at home
for reasons of privacy.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.678
My wife and I share everything,
Mr. Keen.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.357
A truly damning accusation,
don't you think?

19:06.520 --> 19:09.273
Idle speculation.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.408
Then surely
your father should sue?

19:11.567 --> 19:12.159
Gordon is often away,

19:12.318 --> 19:13.865
as you know, Mr. Keen.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.200
His father doesn't consult him
on his every move.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.579
The Civic Building Society
has asked me to speak with you

19:19.742 --> 19:21.085
about your father.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.711
What about him?

19:22.870 --> 19:24.622
They want him to put a stop
to this bad publicity.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.791
He gets plenty
of good publicity too.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.630
This headline is personal.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.010
Whether true or not,

19:30.169 --> 19:31.591
it reflects appallingly
on the company as a whole.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.928
There was a time your father
was the company.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.552
Those days are over.

19:39.762 --> 19:40.809
Thank you for the tea.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.144
I'll see myself out.

19:50.147 --> 19:53.196
I think my father's in very
serious trouble, Grace.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.664
Get me the company lawyer.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.797
I urgently need to speak
about Harry Selfridge.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.698
Kitty?

20:40.865 --> 20:41.787
Kitty?

21:27.912 --> 21:30.415
I know you're not keen
on going down this route,

21:30.581 --> 21:32.003
but I took the liberty
of making some phone calls.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.418
These are letters of intent

21:33.584 --> 21:34.756
from some of the wealthiest
investors in the country.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.842
They want your properties,
Harry.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.927
Prime locations,
street frontage--

21:39.089 --> 21:40.841
the building values
have never been so high.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.263
But it's the properties
they want, not the companies?

21:45.429 --> 21:46.681
Once you've sold,
you've sold.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.099
You sign these
and I'm telling you,

21:48.265 --> 21:50.267
any bank would salivate
to underwrite them.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.903
All your problems disappear
by close of day tomorrow.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.622
I can't do it, Jimmy.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.704
Too many families involved.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.493
They'd make
a handsome profit too.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.664
It's not all about the profit.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.832
Take my solution, Harry,

22:12.998 --> 22:14.591
not as a business associate,
but as a friend.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.253
Let me help you.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.184
I can't lay my mistakes
on Gordon.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.936
Thank you for your hard work.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.017
(knocking)

22:29.849 --> 22:32.227
Extra security's in place
for the night, Mr. Selfridge.

22:32.393 --> 22:33.736
They'll call me if there's
anything untoward.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.316
Thank you.

22:39.817 --> 22:43.412
A man like D'Ancona
doesn't make idle threats.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.447
You've only got a few days.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.456
What are you going to do?

22:57.459 --> 22:59.678
You might be
my brother-in-law,

22:59.837 --> 23:01.885
but I'd still like
to biff you one.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.515
Be my guest.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.310
Thanks for coming.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.691
You don't know
how lucky you are.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.523
How could you be so stupid?

23:14.685 --> 23:16.312
It was a moment of madness.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.604
I'm not sure
I understand myself.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.568
Now, Kitty is a proud girl.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.032
You're gonna have
to humble yourself.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.788
Find a way
to get through to her.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.369
She's thrown me out, George.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.830
I've got no one
to turn to.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.465
I'm glad Mr. Grove
told you.

23:36.624 --> 23:40.379
The burden of silence
has been weighing heavily on me.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.967
Is there really
nothing we can do?

23:43.130 --> 23:45.224
Support him and his family
as best we can.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.764
Um...

23:51.931 --> 23:56.152
I tried all the high interest
finance houses in London, chief.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.857
Last week, they'd have
jumped over one another

23:58.020 --> 23:59.067
to give you a loan.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.276
Now no one will touch me

24:00.439 --> 24:02.316
because of one
newspaper headline.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.620
Thank you, Mr. Crabb.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.871
You did your best.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.283
Anything else
you'd like me to try?

24:10.449 --> 24:13.623
There's only one thing I can do.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.209
But it's too terrible
a decision to make.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.841
It just needs
a couple of extra tucks.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.263
It's beautiful.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.059
You're a magician,
Miss Brockless.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.314
Goodness, is that really me?

24:37.601 --> 24:39.729
Do you know, I don't think
I can do it justice.

24:39.895 --> 24:40.942
You look beautiful.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.118
I never thought
of a bridesmaid.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.244
Meryl, would you...?

24:50.489 --> 24:51.866
Thank you.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.626
That means a lotto me.

24:54.785 --> 24:57.038
Good.

MISS ELLIS:
Ah, the wanderer returns.

25:08.549 --> 25:11.143
I'll expect this work completed
by tomorrow.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.723
But that will take all night,
Miss Ellis.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.389
Not my problem.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.229
And there's plenty more
backed up

25:17.391 --> 25:19.314
when you've finished
that lot.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.023
Unless you feel
you're not up to it.

Credit is no longer available.

25:53.218 --> 25:57.439
Well, I'll have a word
with Mr. Selfridge.

25:57.598 --> 25:58.895
Excellent idea.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.199
You cut us off
without a say so, Harry?

26:14.364 --> 26:17.368
You crossed a line with that
dance in the Palm Court.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.002
It was stupid of us.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.538
We're sorry, Harry.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.378
Apology accepted,
now if you'll excuse me...

26:23.540 --> 26:24.666
Was the newspaper
headline true?

26:24.833 --> 26:26.676
(laughs)

26:26.835 --> 26:28.052
Thought you'd get
one last spree, Rosie?

26:28.212 --> 26:29.464
We owe you so much.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.007
You'll never know.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.800
Now get out.

We've been talking a long while
about going back to New York,

26:34.593 --> 26:36.220
haven't we, Jenny?

26:36.386 --> 26:37.558
Maybe it's about time.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.395
What do you think, Harry?

26:40.557 --> 26:43.777
You can do whatever you like
as far as I'm concerned.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.325
Mind yourself, Jenny.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.116
Don't let those so-and-sos
grind you down, Harry.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.094
Hello.

It's just for a few days,
Connie.

is awkward for you.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.097
I'd be so grateful.

George Towler, you've got
soft mush for a brain!

27:21.723 --> 27:24.021
Well, don't expect me

27:24.184 --> 27:26.778
to lay out the red carpet
for a philanderer.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.448
I'm really sorry.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.734
Not half as sorry

Yes, and I said
I'm not ready to go.

I'll make my own way home.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.038
I'm quite relieved.

He's a little
too demanding for me.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.158
I'd love that.

Thank you.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.582
You know what?
I've lost my appetite.

You think she found
the prize in you?

31:10.619 --> 31:12.121
Well, let me tell you,
Frank Edwards,

31:12.287 --> 31:14.085
you got the prize in her.

31:14.247 --> 31:17.251
Because my sister
will always be first prize,

31:17.417 --> 31:21.513
and you are just a weak,
grubby runner-up.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.473
I deserved that.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.888
Have you told Kitty
how sorry you are?

31:29.054 --> 31:31.056
I said men can be foolish.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.234
And you're the writer?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.816
A man of words?

31:36.978 --> 31:38.480
I got stuck.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.365
We were talking
about having a baby,

31:40.524 --> 31:42.401
and then suddenly
all this stuff came out.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.320
Listen, Frank,
Kitty's different.

31:45.487 --> 31:48.457
Connie's always wanted a baby,
and now we've been blessed.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.538
But Kitty was born to fly.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.668
If you thought
you could pin her down

31:52.828 --> 31:56.378
by having a baby,
it wouldn't have worked.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.042
She got this big job offer
in New York

31:58.208 --> 31:59.960
when I was struggling at work.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.380
I was jealous.

32:02.546 --> 32:05.345
Small and petty
and ridiculouslyjealous.

32:05.507 --> 32:06.884
You're right--
you were.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.144
But if you love one another

32:09.302 --> 32:12.021
the way I think you do,
there's always hope.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.433
I wish I could believe that.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.702
Alice, Alice!

32:26.862 --> 32:27.909
We agreed I'd wear
the white one for the wedding!

32:28.071 --> 32:29.414
You said you wanted
the lilac!

32:29.573 --> 32:30.199
No, I didn't.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.538
Give it to me now.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.795
This thing is
strangling me!

32:34.953 --> 32:36.671
We're never going
to be ready on time.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.503
All right, enough!

32:38.665 --> 32:40.838
Everyone to your rooms now!

32:41.001 --> 32:43.003
Alice,
you give that back!

32:47.591 --> 32:49.059
(deep exhale)

32:57.684 --> 33:01.029
I can't do this to you.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.407
I don't know
what I was thinking.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.818
Why on earth would you want
to take on this unruly lot?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.736
Roger...
It's not fair on you.

33:10.113 --> 33:15.620
You walk in a room
and I think,

33:15.785 --> 33:17.162
"oh!

33:17.329 --> 33:22.256
I hadn't even realized
part of me had left."

33:26.338 --> 33:28.636
You know when someone's hurt
or slighted me

33:28.798 --> 33:30.220
when no one else
would even notice.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.977
Josie...

33:35.514 --> 33:37.642
You've left me desolate
when you broke my heart.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.609
But insanely happy
when you put it all

33:43.772 --> 33:45.490
back together again.

33:48.318 --> 33:50.286
I don't deserve you.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.453
It's called love, my darling.

33:56.993 --> 34:01.544
And I am utterly incapable
of not feeling it for you.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.629
And believe me,
I have tried.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.467
And that's all I have to say
on the matter.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.183
Why don't you call down
that motley mob

34:19.349 --> 34:21.522
and see if we can't get them
through that front door

34:21.685 --> 34:24.279
without killing
each another.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.656
Do you think your godfather
has forgotten the ring, Arthur?

34:26.815 --> 34:28.067
VICAR:
All rise.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.156
Oh, I say.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.366
Here we go.

34:32.529 --> 34:33.906
Would you, Arthur?

34:34.072 --> 34:34.994
Thank you.

34:50.922 --> 34:51.844
Thank you.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.101
At last.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.183
It's the dust mites,
Mildred.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.393
Churches are plagued
with them.

35:02.142 --> 35:03.689
Please be seated.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.611
Dearly beloved,

35:09.899 --> 35:11.993

of this congregation

35:12.152 --> 35:14.746

this man and this women

35:14.904 --> 35:16.156
in holy matrimony.

35:34.883 --> 35:35.805
Thank you, Arthur.

35:42.432 --> 35:44.730
VICAR: I now pronounce
you man and wife.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.195
Welcome to the family,
Mrs. Grove.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.783

Well done, father!

36:00.116 --> 36:02.084
Please! This is a house
of worship.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.622
Today, Reverend,
this is a house of happiness.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.292
Complete happiness.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.334
(laughs)

36:09.501 --> 36:10.468
Oh, Roger...

36:10.627 --> 36:12.550
Congratulations,
Mr. and Mrs. Grove.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.431
I wish you all the joy
in the world.

36:30.897 --> 36:31.773
Kitty...

36:31.940 --> 36:32.907
Kitty, please!

36:34.067 --> 36:36.820
Why waste our time?

36:36.986 --> 36:40.707
If I can imagine it,
let's just say you've said it.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.959
You're sorry,
you made a mistake,

36:43.118 --> 36:44.836
you never meant to hurt me,
give you another chance.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.667
Do I have to be interviewed
through the door?

36:46.830 --> 36:49.083
A seat in the living room won't
add anything more original.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.547
I would say those things
if you'd hear me out.

36:51.710 --> 36:52.882
Well, I've saved you
the trouble.

36:53.044 --> 36:53.920
Kitty...

36:54.087 --> 36:55.509
I'm not that woman,
Frank!

36:55.672 --> 36:57.265
Turn a blind eye,
"Boys will be boys."

36:57.424 --> 36:59.176
It's not me.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.851
I have far too much respect
for myself,

37:04.013 --> 37:06.732
even if you don't.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.108
So save your fancy words

37:08.268 --> 37:09.611
for the type of woman
that'll listen.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.029
I'd appreciate it now
if you walked away.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.203
Call Elizabeth Arden.

37:26.369 --> 37:29.339
See if the job is
still available.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.841
She'd be a lucky woman
to get a star like you.

37:35.837 --> 37:39.432
And I hope New York is kinder
to you than I've been.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.738
We've got
a long way to go.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.121
I'm coming!

38:02.280 --> 38:03.623
Bye!

38:05.825 --> 38:07.168
Have a nice time.

38:07.327 --> 38:08.954
Take care,
my dear Meryl.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.963
Come on, we've all
said goodbye!

38:16.586 --> 38:17.462
I'm coming!

38:17.629 --> 38:19.927
Give me a kiss,
Mrs. Grove.

38:23.927 --> 38:24.928

Bye!

38:28.264 --> 38:30.312
Oh, you're making
ever such a scene!

38:31.559 --> 38:33.527
Drive safely!

38:35.855 --> 38:37.402
(honking)

38:37.565 --> 38:39.283
Just married!

38:47.158 --> 38:49.126
I've been trying to get ahold
of Mr. D'Ancona,

38:49.285 --> 38:51.083
but he's advised his office

38:51.246 --> 38:54.216
that your agreement
terminated at 9:00.

38:54.374 --> 38:55.842
It is after 9:00 now,
Mr. Selfridge.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.967
Keep trying, Miss Plunkett.

38:57.126 --> 38:58.048
Keep trying.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.260
<i>ROSALIE:
'”Afraid?' murmured that rat,</i>

39:05.426 --> 39:08.396
"his eyes shining
with unutterable love.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.024
'Afraid?"'

39:11.182 --> 39:13.355
Excuse me, ma'am.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.486
Mr. Selfridge has arranged
to see these gentlemen here

39:15.645 --> 39:17.443
for a private meeting,
apparently.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.778
He didn't say anything to me--
<i>l'll</i> call him.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.739
Please, gentlemen,
take...

39:21.901 --> 39:23.153
What do you think
you're doing?

39:24.362 --> 39:25.238
It's a robbery!

39:25.405 --> 39:26.281
Mommy, mommy!

39:26.447 --> 39:27.448
Fraser,
call the police!

39:28.783 --> 39:29.705
Thank you.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.713
Why don't you call your father,
Mrs. De Bolotoff?

39:35.748 --> 39:37.341
See what he has to say?

39:39.544 --> 39:41.467
I'll be there
as soon as I can, Rosalie.

39:41.629 --> 39:42.881
No, no, don't call the police.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.264
I'm on my way.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.228
Rosalie!

39:59.272 --> 40:00.148
Rosalie!

40:00.315 --> 40:01.862
Are you all right?

40:02.025 --> 40:02.901
Where's Tatiana?

40:03.067 --> 40:04.410
In her bed.

40:04.569 --> 40:05.616
She fell asleep crying.

40:05.778 --> 40:06.654
She was terrified.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.073
I'm so sorry, darling.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.661
They took silver.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.623
Paintings, china...

40:12.785 --> 40:17.256
They took the jewelry
Ma left for me.

40:19.292 --> 40:20.635
Oh, Rosalie...

40:22.170 --> 40:24.798
How could you let this happen
to us, Pa?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.013
I don't know.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.898
I'd run with Violette
into the hall every evening.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.309
Our Pa was home!

40:35.475 --> 40:37.102
Our wonderful, funny,

40:37.268 --> 40:39.236
amazing father.

40:39.395 --> 40:41.318
You'd scoop us up,
a safe pair of hands.

40:41.481 --> 40:43.483
I can be that man again.

40:43.650 --> 40:44.492
I don't feel safe with you
anymore.

40:44.651 --> 40:47.200
The truth is,

40:47.362 --> 40:49.330
I don't think you feel safe
with you anymore.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.342
They're all still on sale, so...

41:03.336 --> 41:05.054
Excuse me.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.813
I spoke with Miss Arden.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.228
The job offer's still open.

41:19.394 --> 41:20.020
Good.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.062
And I'm taking it.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.902
You should.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.109
I'm pleased for you.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.538
Looks like you do know me
after all.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.716
Thank you for coming.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.420
Gordon,
I need your help.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.133
I've been a fool.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.923
I've made many mistakes.

41:49.090 --> 41:51.343
And other people suffer
for them.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.887
The truth is
I'm flat broke.

41:59.142 --> 42:00.018
You're...

42:00.184 --> 42:01.652
You're what?

42:01.811 --> 42:04.030
Pa, are you serious?

42:04.188 --> 42:05.280
How did you let that happen?

42:05.440 --> 42:06.862
It doesn't matter how.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.448
I don't have a single line
of credit left open to me.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.963
Look, you know I'd help
if I could,

42:21.122 --> 42:23.420
but every penny was reinvested
in the provincial stores.

42:29.756 --> 42:31.975
You want to sell them.

42:32.133 --> 42:33.760
I'm sorry.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.599
I understand what I'm asking.

42:35.762 --> 42:38.015
But it's my only option.

42:38.181 --> 42:40.434
Jimmy's putting it all
into place now.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.897
I wish you'd come
to me first.

42:42.060 --> 42:45.189
Jimmy's the man
to broker these deals.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.155
Trust him?

42:51.360 --> 42:52.703
Of course.

42:53.863 --> 42:55.331
Listen...

42:57.200 --> 42:59.294
I know the years you put
into those stores.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.747
Those years came between us.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.258
I know-- I let them.

43:08.961 --> 43:11.680
Of course I want
to help you.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.341
Sell whatever you have to.

43:13.508 --> 43:18.309
I can run the remaining
companies from London.

43:18.471 --> 43:20.565
Thank you.

43:20.723 --> 43:25.103
All that I ever wanted to do
is work by your side.

43:32.151 --> 43:33.824
I'll make it right.

43:42.787 --> 43:46.792
Don't ever come near my family
or my store again.

43:46.958 --> 43:50.929
You terrified my daughter
and my granddaughter.

43:51.087 --> 43:54.557
What kind of a man
does something like that?

43:56.634 --> 43:58.261
Indeed.

44:08.104 --> 44:10.072
♪♪

44:40.303 --> 44:42.271
♪♪

44:57.570 --> 44:58.492
Victor.

44:59.655 --> 45:00.952
What are you doing here?

45:01.115 --> 45:01.991
We're closed.

45:02.158 --> 45:03.501
The door was open.

45:06.579 --> 45:07.580
You expecting someone?

45:07.747 --> 45:08.839
None of your business.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.545
It is my business
if that someone is Mae.

45:13.878 --> 45:16.301
Who do you think
you're talking to, Jimmy?

45:16.464 --> 45:17.807
You might have
past history.

45:17.965 --> 45:19.967
We're the couple now.

45:20.134 --> 45:22.228
You don't own a woman
like Mae, Jimmy.

45:22.386 --> 45:23.638
Keep away from her.

45:26.515 --> 45:28.017
Do you know something?

45:28.184 --> 45:30.983
Might have taken her a bit
of time to realize this,

45:31.145 --> 45:32.772
but she's way out
of your league.

45:34.357 --> 45:35.529
Now come on,
get out of here.

45:35.691 --> 45:37.034
JIMMY:
Get your hands off me!

45:39.904 --> 45:41.076
(loud thud)
