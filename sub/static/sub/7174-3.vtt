up for a different side.

to manufacture stealth composites

They were calling to see
if anything was missing.

32:12.402 --> 32:17.670
And since they had to ask, it means
that they didn't give it to anyone.

isn't working with the OPA

39:43.973 --> 39:46.409
You dealt them out,

39:46.442 --> 39:51.430
then you pointed to the far end
of the yard and you said, now...

39:51.431 --> 39:53.950
"Whoever gets to the tree first, wins."

39:53.969 --> 39:56.252
You dropped your cards
and were halfway there

39:56.284 --> 39:58.487
before anyone else
realized what was happening.

40:00.255 --> 40:03.025
I've never seen your father more proud.

40:04.426 --> 40:07.095
See, here's the thing.

40:07.129 --> 40:10.534
I was terrified for you, I didn't know why.

40:11.366 --> 40:13.069
And now I do.

40:14.337 --> 40:17.040
You will do anything to win.

40:17.072 --> 40:19.275
Just like your father.

40:20.576 --> 40:23.913
That's what got him killed.

40:23.946 --> 40:27.484
I won't play with you, ever again.

40:44.766 --> 40:47.770
MAN: (OVER PA) <i>This is a Star
Helix Security Directive.</i>

40:47.802 --> 40:51.942
<i>Anyone in the Medina without
authorization will be arrested on sight.</i>

41:06.721 --> 41:09.225
<i>This is a Star Helix

41:22.871 --> 41:25.741

41:25.775 --> 41:27.543
<i>Anyone in the Medina
without authorization... </i>

41:27.576 --> 41:29.746
Things are calming down around here.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.547
I'm just going to stick around for
a while, make sure it stays that way.

41:31.580 --> 41:33.116
WOMAN: (OVER PHONE) <i>Understood,
Havelock. I'll pass that along.</i>

41:33.148 --> 41:34.817
Okay.

41:34.850 --> 41:36.518
(METAL DRAGGING)

41:44.826 --> 41:46.161
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

41:47.763 --> 41:49.266
Stay calm, okay?

41:50.465 --> 41:52.569
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

41:53.134 --> 41:55.404
(LAUGHING)

41:55.438 --> 41:58.741
Come on, guys, it's over.
Just... just go home.

41:58.773 --> 42:01.210
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

42:01.243 --> 42:04.648
It's not over, Earther.
It's just beginning.

42:06.348 --> 42:07.750
(GRUNTING)

42:15.757 --> 42:16.759
No...

42:20.261 --> 42:21.930
Remember the <i>Cant?</i>
