That was my butt.

00:36.462 --> 00:37.462
What are you looking at?

00:37.522 --> 00:38.842
Smart money's on boogers.

00:38.891 --> 00:40.331
It's not a booger.

00:40.387 --> 00:41.797
Let the man think for himself!

00:41.855 --> 00:43.055
I don't think it's a booger.

00:43.114 --> 00:44.244
Who asked you?!

00:44.303 --> 00:45.703
It's getting bigger.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.340
It knows what we're thinking.
Huh.

00:47.396 --> 00:48.826
It is definitely growing.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.703
I just hope it's not
that green mould.

00:50.757 --> 00:52.567
It's called green mould.

00:52.621 --> 00:54.561
You see it in a lot
of beach towns,

00:54.603 --> 00:57.173
and filthy, disgusting,
poorly managed restaurants.

00:57.220 --> 00:58.650
Hey!
So, they had to send you, Hugo?

00:58.707 --> 01:00.087
There's no one else
that does this?

01:00.145 --> 01:01.685
I just got mould-certified.

01:01.731 --> 01:03.430
In a month, I'll be cleared
for vermin, too.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.275
Oh, congratulations.

01:05.319 --> 01:08.579
Okay, gene, if you eat this
mould I'll give you five...

01:08.611 --> 01:09.981
Whoa.

01:10.038 --> 01:10.958
Mmm.
Gorgonzola.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.080
So what do I got to do?

01:12.150 --> 01:13.390
Use bleach on it or something?

01:13.429 --> 01:15.179
(CHUCKLES)
Use bleach on it?

01:15.213 --> 01:16.453
Oh, I'll just put bleach on it.

01:16.502 --> 01:18.522
No, of course not, Bob.
I hate you.

01:18.554 --> 01:21.194
This is big.
You have to close.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.385
The whole building will have
to be tented for 48 hours.

01:23.415 --> 01:24.001
Great.

01:24.066 --> 01:25.396
There goes our weekend revenue.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.883
Ooh, two days off!

01:26.940 --> 01:28.920
Bobby, we could use it.

01:28.973 --> 01:30.989
I guess it has been a while
since we've had a break.

01:31.019 --> 01:32.495
Yeah. Ten years.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.252
What?
That's... can't be right.

01:34.316 --> 01:36.466
Ten years.

01:36.517 --> 01:38.887
You're really living
the dream, Linda.

01:38.926 --> 01:41.286
Aren't you done, Hugo?
Sure, Bob, I'm done.

01:41.325 --> 01:44.385
Mould! Dangerous killer mould!

01:44.418 --> 01:45.968
Floating death spores!
Everyone move!

01:46.024 --> 01:47.254
Gene, how are you feeling?

01:47.312 --> 01:49.212
Kind of nauseous.
A little light-headed.

01:49.265 --> 01:50.465
Pretty good.

01:50.524 --> 01:51.994
Glad I ate it.

01:52.041 --> 01:53.841
You say that about everything.
Yeah.

01:53.895 --> 01:55.265
Green mould, huh?

01:55.322 --> 01:56.852
Yeah. You ever dealt
with this stuff?

01:56.889 --> 01:58.189
Oh, sure.

01:58.247 --> 02:00.047
We get all kinds of mouldy
bodies at the home.

02:00.101 --> 02:02.151
Not on the bodies.
I mean on the walls or...

02:02.202 --> 02:03.952
And you should see the shut-ins.
Stop.

02:04.006 --> 02:06.036
One guy's back looked
like a putting green!

02:06.088 --> 02:07.468
Oh, dear lord.

02:07.526 --> 02:09.066
Hey, you got to get out
of the apartment

02:09.096 --> 02:10.582
while the mould guys work, right?

02:10.638 --> 02:11.980
Yeah. We're going
to go to a motel.

02:12.010 --> 02:14.106
And we're going to tear
into that mini bar!

02:14.158 --> 02:15.658
Yeah, we're going
to go on a bender.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.415
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.

02:17.494 --> 02:19.624
I'm going to drink some
baileys and unwind.

02:19.705 --> 02:20.855
Hey, guys,

02:20.931 --> 02:22.961
stay with me.

02:23.041 --> 02:25.401
No. I mean... I appreciate the
offer, but I... Listen to me.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.413
I live alone
in an enormous apartment.

02:28.488 --> 02:30.828
That happens to be
above a funeral home.

02:30.890 --> 02:32.920
Hmm.
So, come on, stay with me.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.520
Ah, thanks!
Yeah! Yeah, yeah!

02:34.578 --> 02:36.658
Linda, seriously, you want
to stay in a funeral home?

02:36.692 --> 02:37.878
Why not?
Yes, yes!

02:37.945 --> 02:39.395
It'll be fun.
Is it spooky?

02:39.472 --> 02:41.112
You mean, do I have
a medicine cabinet

02:41.201 --> 02:42.901
full of corpse moisturisers?

02:42.959 --> 02:44.159
Ooh!
Yes.

02:44.235 --> 02:46.465
Do they make my skin
soft as a baby?

02:46.567 --> 02:48.237
You decide.

02:48.305 --> 02:49.905
(GASPS)
It's not greasy, either.

don't climb on anything.

don't touch me afterwards.

have a drawer full of gum

03:28.617 --> 03:30.183
that he takes out
of corpse pockets?

Well, I get a lot of stuff cheap.

a vacation for you two.

Oh, we can make it the
honeymoon we never had.

04:07.695 --> 04:10.195
Sure. You know, I got the bed
you're sleeping in

04:10.278 --> 04:11.978

It's a hobby of mine, Lin.

05:06.243 --> 05:07.883
From back when I could
still have hobbies.

05:07.915 --> 05:09.881
I just relax, turn my brain off

05:09.961 --> 05:12.261

of the build.

Yeah, the bus from speed.

movie so much. I never saw it.

I don't like to see the movie
until I finish the model.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.973
Hmm.
Makes it more fun.

05:22.051 --> 05:24.821
Wouldn't it be more fun
if we did something together,

05:24.895 --> 05:27.535

Like couples manicures?

05:27.618 --> 05:29.598
Or couples waxing?

who are dating, Linda.

I just switch it up.

07:13.050 --> 07:15.806
Okay. No, no, no,
make me one of those tuxedo t-shirts.

07:15.890 --> 07:17.420
Do that. That'll be funny.

07:17.498 --> 07:19.058
Well, that's stupid.
I don't like those.

Ah, I see you're still
playing with your dolls.

07:22.523 --> 07:25.493
Mm-hmm.
I just got back from a salsa boot camp.

07:25.578 --> 07:28.618

salsa-ita. All by myself.

Oh, nothing.
This is just silly.

07:37.365 --> 07:39.345
Asked a girl on a date.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.026
A date?

07:41.104 --> 07:42.384
It was the kids' idea.

07:42.481 --> 07:45.081
Yup.
I proposed a romantic rendezvous

07:45.164 --> 07:48.534
for 8:00 P.M. tonight
at the elegant Jimmy Pesto's.

07:48.611 --> 07:50.251

07:50.329 --> 07:52.459
What?
I only know two restaurants.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.610
And they have cloth napkins.

07:54.681 --> 07:56.251
Don't rub it in.
Calm down.

07:56.329 --> 07:57.629
Hey, she replied.

07:57.705 --> 07:59.035
Already?
Too soon. Am I right?

07:59.112 --> 08:00.342
It's not a good sign.

", it's a date.
See you at 8:00."

08:02.660 --> 08:03.960

08:04.026 --> 08:05.326

Now what?
Now...

16:58.954 --> 17:00.374
We cremate it.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.922
Cremate?!
No! No cremating dad!

17:03.004 --> 17:04.434
BOB (MUFFLED):
It was a drunk nap!

17:04.512 --> 17:06.442
It's trying to sweet-talk us.

17:06.501 --> 17:08.090
That's classic zombie.

I'm going to die alone.

17:27.143 --> 17:29.983
And I'm in my lazy pants.
Linda hates these pants.

17:30.067 --> 17:31.677
Damn it, they're coming off!

How?

17:36.137 --> 17:37.887
Just pull all
the levers. A lot.

17:37.956 --> 17:39.846
But they look
like robot wieners.

17:39.926 --> 17:40.926
I know!

Whoo-hoo!
I love reggae.

Don't listen to anyone who says

I'm not done.

17:58.215 --> 18:00.115
Let me tell you something.

18:00.195 --> 18:02.395
I haven't known
Samantha very long.

18:02.466 --> 18:05.506
But a woman knows
when another woman is aroused.

Whoo!

Uh-oh.

Good.
Good!

Are you okay, Bob?

18:53.427 --> 18:55.507
I've faced death,.

18:55.567 --> 18:58.217
I know things now.
I know.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.790
You don't just build
the model of life. You...

19:00.883 --> 19:02.803
You watch the movie
of life. You...

19:02.893 --> 19:04.393
You get in the mood and...

19:04.471 --> 19:06.221
Make some ician babies, you two!

19:06.300 --> 19:08.380
. Your name.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.960
Kids are amazing!

19:10.018 --> 19:12.488
Even if they try
to burn you alive in a coffin,

19:12.581 --> 19:13.900
and they will do that.
KIDS: Yeah.

19:13.931 --> 19:14.757
But it's good.

19:14.832 --> 19:16.712
Because you see your whole life

19:16.811 --> 19:18.681
pass before you
as you're burning.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.821
And every pair of pants
you've ever worn.

19:20.881 --> 19:22.671
And you'll see
the love of your life

19:22.731 --> 19:25.931

in Jamaica by herself.

19:26.027 --> 19:28.417

19:29.916 --> 19:31.536
Yes! That's beautiful!

19:31.614 --> 19:33.014
Are you two in love or what?

19:33.091 --> 19:34.721
Hopefully.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.720
Can I hear you say "yeah"?
KIDS: Yeah.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.110
Yes, we are.
Yes, Bob. Yeah!

Right? Feel it! Love!

19:41.252 --> 19:42.942

Say "love"!

Is it disinfected?

19:55.200 --> 19:56.570
Uh... Tina,

19:56.647 --> 19:58.127
do you think maybe you could...

19:58.205 --> 19:59.475
Say no more.

19:59.561 --> 20:01.951
Gene, Louise, now!

20:02.024 --> 20:03.424
Ow, my ear!

20:05.953 --> 20:07.723

LINDA:
Bob!

20:13.952 --> 20:15.362
Ah, disgusting!

20:15.439 --> 20:17.609
I can see your
downstairs dreadlocks.

20:17.691 --> 20:18.751
Go ahead and look, Jimmy.

20:18.826 --> 20:19.826
No, Mon.

20:19.901 --> 20:20.931
Yeah, Mon.

20:21.027 --> 20:23.327
Oh, Bobby, you big goof.

20:23.409 --> 20:25.469
I took off my lazy pants.
Did you notice, Lin?

20:25.549 --> 20:27.749
Yes, I did.
HUGO: God!

20:27.830 --> 20:30.660
Care to couples-dance with me?

20:30.745 --> 20:33.645
On our haunted
Jamaican honeymoon?

20:34.473 --> 20:36.003

20:36.081 --> 20:37.241
That's green mould!

20:37.317 --> 20:38.987
Right there on Jimmy's wall.

20:39.066 --> 20:40.545
What?
Do you see it, Lin? Right there.

20:40.577 --> 20:42.303
LINDA (LAUGHING):
Yes.

20:42.382 --> 20:44.182
Oh, crap.
