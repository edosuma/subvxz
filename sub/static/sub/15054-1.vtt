01:30.765 --> 01:34.304
Listen, Mona. This banana paste
is meant for your survival only.

01:34.436 --> 01:36.223
Besides, I just gave you some.

01:38.273 --> 01:42.649
'Mac, gonna break your heart 'when you
have to eject your buddy in a capsule.'

01:42.777 --> 01:45.611
I'm not. We'll make our
remaining orbits and start back.

01:45.739 --> 01:49.358
- Mona stays with us.
- 'You're the skipper, Colonel.'

01:49.492 --> 01:51.984
We've got enough animal data,
haven't we, Mona?

01:58.543 --> 02:01.206
'Steve and Diane sent that one to you.'

02:06.843 --> 02:10.586
- What do you think?
- I'm thinking. Look at that.

02:13.975 --> 02:15.887
Whoo! Mars is burning up.

02:16.519 --> 02:19.512
Boy, I'm glad Mona doesn't have
to go down into that fire swamp.

02:19.648 --> 02:23.232
Yeah. Hey, what will I fix for dinner?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.853
How about some turkey
with mashed potatoes, gravy added?

02:26.988 --> 02:30.652
I like mine in paste form.
You know, in a tube.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.821
I think the diner can fix it that way.

02:32.953 --> 02:37.243
There's always beefsteak and French
fried onions also in a squeeze tube.

02:37.374 --> 02:40.208
We had that for breakfast, you know.

02:49.302 --> 02:52.670
'Unidentified flying mass. Dead ahead.'

02:52.806 --> 02:54.388
Meteor.

02:55.558 --> 02:56.890
Massive.

02:57.018 --> 02:59.135
Collision course.

03:02.524 --> 03:04.982
Distance interval, 28 seconds.

03:12.117 --> 03:14.530
- Fire main retros.
- Firing main retros.

03:18.915 --> 03:20.076
Which way?

03:23.670 --> 03:26.208
- Fire upper retros.
- Firing upper retros.

03:51.489 --> 03:52.980
We're in a descending orbit.

03:53.116 --> 03:54.698
'Decaying fast, my friend.'

03:54.826 --> 03:59.036
Mars' gravity is taking over, pulling
us down. Calling NASA. Calling NASA.

03:59.164 --> 04:02.783
Colonel Dan McReady,
commanding Mars Gravity Probe 1.

04:02.917 --> 04:06.911
Forced out of orbital velocity
to avoid collision with planetoid

04:07.047 --> 04:09.960
and into tighter orbit of Mars.

04:10.091 --> 04:12.583
The gravity of the planet
is pulling us toward it.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.711
Gotta blast back into orbital velocity.

04:14.846 --> 04:18.010
- 'Use all our fuel.'
- That problem we can lick later.

04:29.277 --> 04:32.486
'Gravity pull has risen to 9.30.'

04:32.614 --> 04:35.778
I see. Well, blast again, delta velocity.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.400
Delta "V" okay.

04:49.047 --> 04:51.755
That's our fuel.

04:54.177 --> 04:57.261
'NASA Earth Satellite
to Mars Gravity Probe 1.

04:57.388 --> 04:59.345
'Do not dissemble space vehicle

04:59.474 --> 05:02.467
'until all other procedures have been tried.'

05:02.602 --> 05:04.935
Prepare to eject. Emergency procedure.

05:12.237 --> 05:14.854
Ready, Mac. So long and good luck.

05:15.740 --> 05:18.858
Okay, Kit. I'll see you when we join up.

05:18.993 --> 05:21.986
- 'Blast off when you're ready.'
- I'm ready.

05:22.122 --> 05:25.115
So long. Be seeing you.

08:21.718 --> 08:24.085
Hello, Mac. How do you read me? Over.

08:26.764 --> 08:29.677
Come on, old buddy. This is Kit.
How do you read me? Over.

10:44.986 --> 10:46.852
Hey!

12:20.790 --> 12:22.122
Hey!

17:24.718 --> 17:26.675
This is Commander Christopher Draper,

17:26.804 --> 17:29.592
the Navy of the United States of America,
planet Earth.

17:29.723 --> 17:33.182
Former co-pilot Mars Gravity Probe 1.

17:33.978 --> 17:35.640
On our third orbit of this planet,

17:35.771 --> 17:38.559
we took evasive action
to avoid collision with a meteor

17:38.691 --> 17:42.605
and were forced
into dangerous gravitational pull of Mars.

17:42.736 --> 17:44.978
We were forced to abandon ship.

17:45.114 --> 17:48.528
As of now, the vehicle frame
is still orbiting Mars.

17:48.659 --> 17:51.572
Seems to have established
gravitational balance.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.380
We ejected capsule without incident.

18:04.508 --> 18:06.716
Colonel Dan McReady ejecting after I did.

18:06.844 --> 18:09.086
I'll set out to look for him tomorrow.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.838
From all indications,
he should be on the other side

18:11.974 --> 18:14.091
of a high range of rocky peaks to the west.

18:15.686 --> 18:18.929
Now, my two most difficult problems
are air and water.

18:19.648 --> 18:22.857
I have, with what's left in my tank
and one reserve cylinder,

18:22.985 --> 18:26.729
enough oxygen for, oh, about 60 hours,

18:26.864 --> 18:29.356
depending, of course,
on how much I exert myself.

18:30.534 --> 18:32.696
My first discovery was that the air on Mars

18:32.828 --> 18:34.820
is far too thin to support human life.

18:35.915 --> 18:41.377
As to water, by severe rationing,
I can get by for about 15 days.

18:41.503 --> 18:44.041
Course, once my air gives out,
water won't matter.

18:44.173 --> 18:46.711
First positive survival point...

18:48.385 --> 18:50.422
...I found a yellow rock.

18:50.554 --> 18:53.763
It's as burnable
as some of our poorer grades of coal.

18:56.685 --> 18:59.974
Heat's uneven, but it should make
the Martian nights endurable.

19:10.574 --> 19:12.736
I feel a little bit like Columbus,

19:12.868 --> 19:15.235
set down in a strange new land,

19:15.371 --> 19:19.536
full of new wonders, new discoveries.

19:20.918 --> 19:23.581
It's a challenge, all right.

19:23.712 --> 19:25.544
A challenge to my training.

19:27.424 --> 19:30.212
Sometimes challenges can get mighty big.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.837
But I'm gonna stay alive, believe me.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.965
That's for the morale officer.

20:55.679 --> 20:58.171
Well, I've licked the heat
and shelter problem.

20:59.183 --> 21:01.175
Breathing, that's a different story.

21:02.644 --> 21:06.479
Moving about, exerting myself, I've found
that I can breathe the air of Mars

21:06.607 --> 21:08.815
for about, oh, 12 to 15 minutes,

21:08.942 --> 21:12.060
before I need to take air
from my tank for a booster.

21:13.197 --> 21:16.190
Lying down, asleep, inactive,

21:16.325 --> 21:18.942
I can get by for an hour
before taking a booster.

21:20.496 --> 21:23.955
In this way, with some discomfort,
I can conserve my oxygen supply.

21:25.542 --> 21:28.376
At the most optimistic appraisal,

21:29.671 --> 21:33.415
...I have 50 or so hours of life left.

21:34.426 --> 21:36.042
God willing.

21:38.405 --> 21:40.468
The problem is sleeping.

21:40.599 --> 21:44.684
If I don't wake up in time to renew
my air supply, it's hearts and flowers.

21:46.146 --> 21:50.214
I've got to make some kind
of alarm device, safeguard myself.

21:54.321 --> 21:57.610
Tomorrow, and morning's
only a couple of hours away,

21:58.492 --> 22:00.825
I'm gonna rejoin Mac.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.535
Good old Mac.

22:04.373 --> 22:06.456
I bet he's got these problems licked.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.798
Mac! Mac!

24:40.279 --> 24:41.815
Mac! Hey, Mac!

24:51.123 --> 24:52.989
Mac! Hey, Mac!

25:11.310 --> 25:13.347
Hey, Mac! Mac!

25:23.113 --> 25:24.570
Mac?

26:43.026 --> 26:47.566
'Now our song.
To Dan, from Elinor, with love.'

27:53.013 --> 27:54.504
Mona!

28:09.779 --> 28:12.066
Come on now. Let's not start a war.

28:24.628 --> 28:26.790
Well, obviously, you don't need that.

28:29.090 --> 28:32.083
Boy... do I need these.

28:35.013 --> 28:37.346
Here. Let's open up those sleeves, huh?

28:44.397 --> 28:46.389
That a little more comfortable, huh?

30:33.715 --> 30:35.832
That's all there is, baby.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.546
Here. Here.

32:47.682 --> 32:49.264
Take the rest of it.

32:53.313 --> 32:56.226
Take the rest of it. Yeah.

32:56.357 --> 32:58.223
That's it.

32:58.359 --> 33:00.396
Mine too.

33:00.528 --> 33:02.770
No more rationing.

33:02.906 --> 33:05.148
You'll have a full belly.

33:07.368 --> 33:09.405
Won't be for long.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.732
This is signature...

33:42.821 --> 33:45.279
Mars Gravity Probe 1.

33:48.743 --> 33:50.860
Colonel Dan McReady dead.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.830
M-M-Me too soon.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.458
No more oxygen.

34:05.426 --> 34:07.088
Over and out.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.637
Thank you.

36:16.099 --> 36:18.136
Well, you can scratch signature.

36:18.267 --> 36:21.055
I've found an answer
that's saved my life temporarily.

36:21.187 --> 36:23.850
These yellow stones that burn like coal.

36:24.607 --> 36:26.639
I've been wondering about this a lot.

36:30.238 --> 36:32.355
Where do they get the oxygen to burn?

36:33.741 --> 36:37.451
It must be similar to solid rocket fuel
with its own built-in oxygen.

36:38.204 --> 36:41.697
Heat and flame release it
and it's breathable.

36:43.334 --> 36:45.121
I've gotta find some way to store it.

36:45.253 --> 36:47.870
As far as life on this planet,

36:48.006 --> 36:51.249
I've seen no sign
of any other living thing anywhere.

36:51.384 --> 36:52.795
Yet.

38:38.157 --> 38:40.019
Hi, baby.

38:40.451 --> 38:44.536
Oh, yeah. What have you
got there, huh? Come here.

38:48.334 --> 38:50.872
That's it. Are you thirsty?

38:55.925 --> 38:58.338
There you go. There you go.

39:01.013 --> 39:03.926
What's the matter?
You wouldn't drink last night either.

40:03.409 --> 40:05.071
Programme "A". Descend.

40:06.579 --> 40:08.787
Veer left!

40:09.749 --> 40:12.241
Veer right!

40:28.309 --> 40:31.723
'Mona the monkey spends
most of her days off somewhere.

40:31.854 --> 40:34.471

You can say that again, brother.

41:50.273 --> 41:51.968
What's your pleasure?

41:56.355 --> 41:59.063
I think we'll make the early show.

41:59.191 --> 42:01.308

That's right.

42:16.876 --> 42:19.789
All right. Once more.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.003
Huh?

42:22.131 --> 42:26.546
Don't eat too much. You know
we're on iron rations. Want some? Here.

Ouch!

as a common brick.

Well, I've found out one thing.

You're not like a camel.
You get thirsty too, huh?

45:02.249 --> 45:04.491
How about a nice, salty biscuit?

45:04.627 --> 45:08.462
Would you like that?
No, that's... No. Too blah, too blah.

45:15.221 --> 45:17.463
Some salt. There.

45:20.476 --> 45:23.310
I'm not trying to be cruel, you understand,

to our survival.

What are you eating?

48:20.072 --> 48:21.688
Not bad.

48:29.081 --> 48:30.492
Could use a little paprika.

48:34.211 --> 48:36.203
Mmm. Not bad at all.

49:40.068 --> 49:44.608
If you just had four words...
Just four that you understood.

49:46.074 --> 49:50.114
'Yes", "no", "come", "go".

49:50.245 --> 49:53.079
That's all. Then we could talk to each other.

Not bad, eh, Mona?

Let's spend a day at the beach.

51:07.281 --> 51:09.989
Ah. You know what we're gonna do, baby?

51:11.118 --> 51:13.485
We're gonna explore this new world of ours.

51:14.872 --> 51:17.831
Scientists tell us there are canals up here.

51:17.958 --> 51:20.541
Like to see those, huh?

51:20.669 --> 51:23.958
And those green areas they spotted
from Earth. How about that?

51:25.382 --> 51:27.339
Then there's the polar ice cap.

What's the matter? No scientific curiosity?

51:46.695 --> 51:48.732
How about a little music?

52:03.420 --> 52:05.582
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. How about that?

52:05.714 --> 52:07.205
How about that?

52:07.341 --> 52:08.752
Hey, Mona!

52:08.884 --> 52:10.967
Hey, Mona! Hey, Mona! Hey, Mona!

52:18.060 --> 52:19.847
Okay. Talk to me.

52:19.978 --> 52:23.062
(ECHOES) Okay. Talk to me.

52:23.190 --> 52:24.556
Say something!

52:24.691 --> 52:26.432
(ECHOES) Say something!

52:28.445 --> 52:30.528
I mean, say something back!

52:30.656 --> 52:33.194
(ECHOES) I mean, say something back!

53:03.313 --> 53:04.849
Mr Echo, go to hell!

53:04.982 --> 53:09.192
(ECHOES) Mr Echo, go to hell!
Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell.

53:18.036 --> 53:19.868
Let's go all out tonight, Mona.

53:19.997 --> 53:22.705
Poi sausage cooked for a change.

53:22.833 --> 53:25.701
Maybe it'll taste better than it looks.

53:47.690 --> 53:50.775
Tonight we eat. Baby, you never
ate like this in the jungle.

53:50.902 --> 53:53.736
Get some of those good sausages in there.

54:26.480 --> 54:30.394
Mona, I hope I haven't given myself ptomaine.

54:30.525 --> 54:32.858
It's eight months to the nearest hospital.

55:28.083 --> 55:29.164
Who's there?

55:32.295 --> 55:34.207
Who is it? Who's there?

56:03.827 --> 56:05.659
Mac!

56:05.787 --> 56:07.619
You've come to see me!

56:08.623 --> 56:10.080
Well, come on in.

56:10.208 --> 56:12.746
Oh, this is great! Really great!

56:17.674 --> 56:20.132
Oh, boy, have I got a lot to tell you!

56:20.260 --> 56:23.469
Listen, Mac, I have just been aching
for someone to talk to.

56:23.597 --> 56:26.010
Buddy, you're gonna be pretty proud of me.

56:26.141 --> 56:29.100
Listen, Mac, I found how to breathe here.

56:29.227 --> 56:31.935
With rocks, Mac! Heated rocks!
Would you believe it?

56:32.063 --> 56:34.555
Wait till the guys in Survival
hear that one, huh?

56:34.691 --> 56:38.731
And I've got water and a place to live!
And heat to keep warm with, Mac.

56:38.862 --> 56:40.524
Oh, and I've got food.

56:41.281 --> 56:43.238
Martian food, Mac!

56:43.366 --> 56:46.279
I bet I've almost done
as well as you have, you old pro.

56:46.953 --> 56:49.195
Well, come on, Mac. What about it?

56:52.334 --> 56:54.496
Listen, aren't you even gonna talk to me?

56:55.503 --> 56:57.335
Mac, what's bugging you?

56:57.464 --> 57:00.002
For God's sake, say hello to me!

57:01.051 --> 57:03.134
What are you sore about?

57:03.261 --> 57:05.048
Oh, Mac, you can't act this way.

57:05.180 --> 57:08.890
Mac, I haven't heard a human voice
in four months. Four, Mac.

57:09.017 --> 57:11.680
I haven't heard your voice.

57:11.811 --> 57:15.851
Mac, say anything to me, please!
For God's sake, talk to me! Say anything!

57:15.982 --> 57:17.439
Oh, God, please!

57:17.567 --> 57:19.934
Talk to me! Say anything! Please!

57:20.070 --> 57:22.487
Please! God, say anything, Mac! By God!

57:25.951 --> 57:27.362
Mac?

57:48.098 --> 57:52.342
All right, here's another note
for you boys in Survival,

57:52.477 --> 57:54.935
for you geniuses in Human Factors.

57:55.730 --> 57:58.689
A guy can lick the problems
of heat, water, shelter, food.

57:58.817 --> 58:00.729
I know. I've done it.

58:00.860 --> 58:03.477
And here's the hairiest problem of all -

58:03.613 --> 58:06.606
isolation, being alone.

58:06.741 --> 58:08.573
Boy, here's where he'll crack.

58:08.702 --> 58:10.489
Here's where he'll go under.

58:10.620 --> 58:12.407
I know, I know, I had great training,

58:12.539 --> 58:14.997
including two months
in the isolation chamber.

58:15.792 --> 58:19.035
But when I was in that chamber,
I knew I was coming out.

58:19.170 --> 58:21.708
I knew I'd be with people again.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.752
But up here on Mars,

58:23.883 --> 58:26.876
you gotta face the reality
of being alone forever.

01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:34.064
'It is now three weeks since
I found the skeleton by the black mesas.

01:01:34.199 --> 01:01:36.361
'I had to conclude it was murder

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:40.112
'because there was a large, neat hole
in the forehead of the skull.

01:01:40.246 --> 01:01:43.114
'The back of the skull
was fused and charred.'

01:01:48.087 --> 01:01:51.330
Because of this, I have concealed
or destroyed any outward sign

01:01:51.466 --> 01:01:53.277
that anyone is living...

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.637
Ho! Mona!

01:02:47.772 --> 01:02:50.185
That's an interplanetary vehicle!

01:02:50.316 --> 01:02:52.774
Oh, Mona, they've come to get us!

01:06:04.969 --> 01:06:07.882
Well, come on. If they're after you,
let's get out of here.

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:02.649
Have a chair, stranger.

01:07:02.777 --> 01:07:05.110
Come on. Sit.

01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:08.527
Sit down. Come on.

01:07:27.718 --> 01:07:31.507
Mona, shut up! First visitor
we've ever had and you act like a gorilla!

01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:36.141
Don't let my furry little monster
bother you. Come on. Sit down.

01:07:37.478 --> 01:07:38.844
Well, sit.

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:47.941
What do I say to a guy like you?

01:07:50.324 --> 01:07:52.190
How do you communicate?

01:07:54.328 --> 01:07:56.445
Thought transfer?

01:07:56.581 --> 01:07:58.664
Electronic signals?

01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:02.413
Maybe you've even got a spoken language.

01:08:06.132 --> 01:08:09.125
Where do you come from
and how are you like us?

01:08:15.641 --> 01:08:17.473
And how are you different?

01:08:22.023 --> 01:08:23.854
How do you breathe without a booster?

01:08:23.983 --> 01:08:26.645
Well, I prayed for a companion,
and I finally got one.

01:08:26.777 --> 01:08:28.689
And he can't even make a sound.

01:09:46.232 --> 01:09:47.643
You're an escaped slave.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.332
Come here.

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:11.212
Come here.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.876
Come on.

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:38.027
No, no. Not this.

01:10:41.746 --> 01:10:43.112
Me.

01:10:43.247 --> 01:10:45.534
I'm the boss. And remember that.

01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:48.329
You get out of line just one iota

01:10:48.461 --> 01:10:50.919
and I'll bring your enemies
back into this cave.

01:11:09.648 --> 01:11:11.731
Here. Have a little of this.

01:11:44.975 --> 01:11:47.308
Last night occurred the most important event

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:50.179
since I landed on Mars 147 days ago.

01:11:50.314 --> 01:11:53.022
An interplanetary space vehicle
made a landing,

01:11:53.150 --> 01:11:56.439
like no space vehicle
I've ever seen on Earth.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.483
From what I see from my videotape,

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:02.028
it was manned by some animated beings,

01:12:02.159 --> 01:12:04.401
obviously from some planet other than Mars.

01:12:04.537 --> 01:12:07.371
They're here, apparently,
on an ore-gathering expedition.

01:12:07.498 --> 01:12:10.366
They mine electronically by remote control.

01:12:10.501 --> 01:12:13.665
They also use slaves
and they handle them electronically.

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:17.289
One of them escaped. He's with me.

01:12:17.424 --> 01:12:20.792
And I'm trying to establish
communication with him.

01:12:20.928 --> 01:12:23.295
He's pretty much like an Earth being,

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:25.422
except he's completely mute.

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.759
And, for all I know, deaf.

01:12:34.692 --> 01:12:38.652
As a companion, Cosmos, Mona's better.

01:12:38.779 --> 01:12:41.567
A-okay, baby? Time to turn in.

01:13:04.263 --> 01:13:06.095
I'll give you the guest room. Come on.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.216
Come on.

01:14:49.827 --> 01:14:51.238
Good night.

01:15:45.799 --> 01:15:47.131
Listen, mister.

01:15:47.259 --> 01:15:51.253
You're gonna be welcome around here
only as long as you leave things alone.

01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:56.095
I don't know whether you were fooling
around or whether you've got any ideas.

01:15:56.226 --> 01:15:58.183
Either way, it can be dangerous.

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:04.231
Don't touch.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.898
Understand? Hands off!

01:16:48.445 --> 01:16:50.812
No, thanks. I'll stick to air.

01:17:56.346 --> 01:17:58.429
Oh. I got rid of 'em, huh?

01:17:59.224 --> 01:18:01.386
I got the power. Is that it?

01:18:01.518 --> 01:18:03.851
Okay, okay, that's enough.

01:18:07.566 --> 01:18:09.728
Come on. I'm not supernatural.

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.352
Come on, Joe, or whatever your name is.

01:18:12.488 --> 01:18:15.276
Um... Friday. That's it.

01:18:15.407 --> 01:18:17.364
With apologies to Robinson Crusoe.

01:18:18.076 --> 01:18:19.958
On your feet, Friday.

01:18:22.414 --> 01:18:24.406
My God!

01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:26.373
I thought you were a mute!

01:18:29.296 --> 01:18:33.131
Uh-huh. If you can make sounds like that,
you can make English sounds.

01:18:33.258 --> 01:18:36.877
You're gonna learn English if I have
to sit on your chest for two months.

01:18:46.104 --> 01:18:48.221
Friday, say "stone".

01:18:49.399 --> 01:18:51.436
"Stone", Friday.

01:18:59.618 --> 01:19:01.484
Stone.

01:19:03.455 --> 01:19:05.900
No, no, no, no. Stone!

01:19:08.335 --> 01:19:11.328
Listen, retarded, I don't know
what you're trying to tell me,

01:19:11.463 --> 01:19:14.877
but we're not budging from this spot
till you learn some words.

01:19:15.008 --> 01:19:16.340
A-okay?

01:19:16.468 --> 01:19:18.084
No, idiot! Stone!

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.679
A-okay. Stone.

01:19:37.364 --> 01:19:39.356
Friday, will you take that...

01:19:39.991 --> 01:19:41.323
Friday?

01:19:43.829 --> 01:19:45.161
Friday!

01:19:45.289 --> 01:19:46.700
Friday!

01:19:54.631 --> 01:19:56.293
Friday!

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:12.199
What are you after here? They've gone.

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:22.438
They took off, huh?

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:24.062
Your friends were expendable.

01:22:26.199 --> 01:22:27.610
Nice guys.

01:22:34.624 --> 01:22:38.664
They had no air pills? It wouldn't have
mattered much, the way they blasted them.

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:43.915
<i>Ahmateklat. Ahmateklat.</i>

01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:46.667
That's okay, Friday.

01:22:46.803 --> 01:22:48.635
Welcome aboard.

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:06.862
Look out!

01:26:36.574 --> 01:26:38.440
Thank you.

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:44.789
<i>A-Ahmateklat.</i>

01:26:46.793 --> 01:26:48.625
<i>Ahmateklat.</i>

01:27:16.322 --> 01:27:19.941
'"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

01:27:21.286 --> 01:27:24.870
'"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

01:27:24.998 --> 01:27:27.741
'"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

01:27:28.418 --> 01:27:30.751
'"He restoreth my soul.

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:34.498
'"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His namesake.

01:27:35.633 --> 01:27:39.798
'"Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil."'

01:27:42.974 --> 01:27:44.590
Friday talk.

01:27:45.894 --> 01:27:47.305
Huh.

01:27:47.437 --> 01:27:50.020
Friday talk. A-okay?

01:27:50.148 --> 01:27:52.105
Yeah, A-okay.

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.940
But don't just copy me.

01:27:54.986 --> 01:27:57.228
Not copy you.

01:27:57.363 --> 01:27:59.525
No. You tell me something.

01:27:59.657 --> 01:28:02.195
Tell me what's inside you.

01:28:02.327 --> 01:28:06.116
Tell me... for instance,
where do you live? What planet?

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:07.829
Where's your home?

01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:10.457
Home?

01:28:12.712 --> 01:28:15.420
- Home.
- No, no, no. Home.

01:28:24.557 --> 01:28:25.889
Weetawin.

01:28:27.227 --> 01:28:28.889
We call that group of stars Orion.

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.611
Osatanango.

01:28:39.739 --> 01:28:42.652
You come from the centre star
in the belt of Orion.

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:46.073
We call that Alnilam,
which I'm sure is very interesting to you.

01:28:46.204 --> 01:28:47.661
I come from over there.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.536
Just around the corner from you.

01:28:53.378 --> 01:28:55.961
Now, come on. Keep the conversation going.

01:29:01.344 --> 01:29:02.676
- Enemy.
- Yeah?

01:29:03.388 --> 01:29:04.799
Come back.

01:29:04.931 --> 01:29:06.388
When?

01:29:07.934 --> 01:29:09.721
- Soon.
- How soon?

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.145
60 suns.

01:29:14.274 --> 01:29:17.392
60 suns. That's two months. They're overdue.

01:29:17.527 --> 01:29:19.564
Listen, they can find you with these?

01:29:21.364 --> 01:29:24.072
- Enemy find Friday?
- Enemy come.

01:29:25.034 --> 01:29:28.323
We've gotta figure out some way
of getting these things off.

01:29:28.454 --> 01:29:32.494
'For the survival record,
I've been taking Friday's oxygen pills.

01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:35.459
'Chemically, of course,
I have no way of analysing them.

01:29:35.587 --> 01:29:38.625
'As to how they work,
I've noticed that I inhale and exhale

01:29:38.756 --> 01:29:40.713
'and use the thin Martian atmosphere.

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.678
'But I don't need it.

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:52.476
'Somehow these pills bypass the lungs
and produce oxygen right in the blood.'

01:29:56.441 --> 01:29:58.649
Enemy! Enemy!

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:20.791
Get the gear together!

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:21.079
This way good. A-okay.

01:33:40.873 --> 01:33:42.739
Yes, Friday? What is it?

01:33:59.475 --> 01:34:01.762
This Quiquay Tanango.

01:34:01.894 --> 01:34:04.932
- You call Mars.
- Yes, Mars.

01:34:09.277 --> 01:34:10.984
Those look like the canals of Mars.

01:34:17.076 --> 01:34:19.693
You mean these are part
of the canals of Mars?

01:34:28.588 --> 01:34:32.707
I get it. Some kind of earthquake
or volcano opened up these fissures?

01:34:33.384 --> 01:34:35.501
And the crust above sagged?

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:38.925
- And those are the canals above us?
- Canals.

01:34:39.056 --> 01:34:41.343
They must go on for hundreds of miles.

01:34:43.686 --> 01:34:46.019
They'll be our underground highway.

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:48.230
Our bomb shelter.

01:34:48.357 --> 01:34:51.270
And somewhere we'll come out again
and make a new home.

01:34:51.402 --> 01:34:53.735
What's been done before can be done again.

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.968
Well, they know where we are.

01:35:18.095 --> 01:35:20.007
But they can't get at us.

01:35:20.139 --> 01:35:22.347
I'll get this damn thing off
as soon as I can.

01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:02.147
Water gone.

01:37:03.868 --> 01:37:06.201
We'll have to go up to the surface.

01:37:55.044 --> 01:37:57.001
The polar ice cap.

01:37:57.630 --> 01:37:59.917
Water. Much water.

01:38:14.772 --> 01:38:16.638
You go. Friday stay.

01:38:16.774 --> 01:38:19.357
- Why?
- Enemy.

01:38:19.944 --> 01:38:21.731
We're sticking together, buddy.

01:38:22.655 --> 01:38:25.944
- "Buddy"?
- Yeah. Slang for "brother". Come on.

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:52.554
Water. Water.

01:38:52.685 --> 01:38:54.426
Gotta find water.

01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:56.895
If we don't find water pretty soon...

01:38:57.022 --> 01:38:58.888
Put Mona down.

01:38:59.942 --> 01:39:03.356
She can walk to the ice cap
as well as we can.

01:39:09.869 --> 01:39:11.280
Come on, Mona.

01:39:28.846 --> 01:39:30.257
Rest here.

01:39:30.848 --> 01:39:34.262
Not long... reach ice cap.

01:40:09.595 --> 01:40:11.507
Not too far to the snow now, baby.

01:40:15.768 --> 01:40:18.385
Rest. Rest here.

01:40:20.231 --> 01:40:22.268
When's the last time you took an oxygen pill?

01:40:24.944 --> 01:40:26.355
Give me those.

01:40:31.408 --> 01:40:33.024
I thought you said we had 12 left.

01:40:35.204 --> 01:40:37.287
You've been holding out on yourself.

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:39.580
Saving them for me.

01:40:39.708 --> 01:40:41.495
No wonder you're weak.

01:40:43.379 --> 01:40:45.746
Here. Here!

01:40:51.971 --> 01:40:54.463
I'll take charge of these. Bring Mona.

01:40:56.225 --> 01:40:58.763
Water! Friday, water!

01:41:04.775 --> 01:41:06.611
Not too much. Cold.

01:41:07.593 --> 01:41:09.755
Yeah, you're right.

01:41:10.823 --> 01:41:13.281
I tell you, Mona, she know.

01:41:13.409 --> 01:41:15.446
Yeah, you bet she does.

01:41:17.997 --> 01:41:19.829
Oh, thank God for water.

01:41:19.957 --> 01:41:21.323
God?

01:41:24.587 --> 01:41:25.919
God.

01:41:26.630 --> 01:41:28.963
Yeah. Supreme Being.

01:41:29.091 --> 01:41:31.458
Uh, Father of the universe.

01:41:32.511 --> 01:41:35.219
Big Father. Big Father!

01:41:36.098 --> 01:41:37.680
<i>Kaihechipek.</i>

01:41:37.808 --> 01:41:39.299
We say <i>kaihechipek.</i>

01:41:40.352 --> 01:41:41.684
Order.

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.021
<i>Kaihechipek.</i>

01:41:46.025 --> 01:41:48.517
Order. God.

01:41:50.446 --> 01:41:51.778
Good.

01:41:52.531 --> 01:41:54.568
Yeah. That's right.

01:41:55.367 --> 01:41:58.280
Divine order. Good.

01:42:11.508 --> 01:42:13.295
Mona, keep warm.

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:17.716
Looks like the only way out of here is up.

01:44:16.467 --> 01:44:18.208
Dig, Friday. Dig!

01:44:18.343 --> 01:44:21.757
Mona sick. Need fire. She cold.

01:44:21.889 --> 01:44:24.381
We'll all freeze
if we don't get a shelter built.

01:44:24.516 --> 01:44:27.259
Our bodies will keep us warm,
just like the Eskimos.

01:44:32.649 --> 01:44:34.732
Come on! Keep digging!

01:44:53.003 --> 01:44:55.290
How long have you had that thing on?

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:57.379
- 62 years.
- What?

01:44:58.092 --> 01:45:01.381
- How old are you, anyway?
- 78.

01:45:16.151 --> 01:45:17.562
Look out!

01:45:55.065 --> 01:45:57.603
- Forget it.
- Friday, no.

01:45:57.734 --> 01:45:59.600
God not forget.

01:46:47.576 --> 01:46:50.239
Quick. Get that equipment out of the water.

01:47:12.184 --> 01:47:14.392
Mona. Where Mona?

01:47:26.031 --> 01:47:27.442
Here they come again.

01:47:29.743 --> 01:47:32.201
Not enemy.

01:47:32.329 --> 01:47:33.740
Different.

01:47:36.083 --> 01:47:40.293
'Space Rescue Group 3 to Earth Satellite.
One more fact to report.

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.379
'The meteor that struck Mars
is melting the polar ice cap.'

01:47:43.507 --> 01:47:45.248
Not enemy. Talk like you!

01:47:45.384 --> 01:47:48.222
Like me! Like me, Friday!

01:47:52.683 --> 01:47:56.973
Uh... this is Commander Christopher Draper...

01:47:58.563 --> 01:48:00.395
...of the United States Navy.

01:48:00.524 --> 01:48:02.561
'My God! A voice from Mars!'

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:23.203
Hey! Hey! Hey, yahoo! Whoo!
