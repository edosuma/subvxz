He doesn't answer messages and calls. He doesn't even come to the office.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.900
If their representative called for me, say I'm not in the office.

02:30.100 --> 02:34.000

03:36.750 --> 03:38.800
I don't know, I'm too embarrassed so I just left.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.600
Have you contacted his agency? What did they said?

03:41.600 --> 03:43.700
He's still unreachable

I'm sorry, but you'll have to take separate seats.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.400
It doesn't matter.

How come... there is such a beauty here in Busan?

20:42.100 --> 20:44.050
- It's to die for!
- Hey.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.650
Why? You said you're an acquaintance?

20:47.150 --> 20:49.800
Then in Busan.. were you classmates?

20:53.500 --> 20:54.450
Yeah! (in Busan dialect)

20:57.050 --> 20:59.000
Why have I not seen you before?

21:06.450 --> 21:11.150
I am Kim Jaehyun. May I know my classmate's name? (in Busan dialect)

21:12.200 --> 21:13.800
I'm Bae Soojung.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.550
Are you really Soojung? You've gotten prettier! (in Busan dialect)

21:21.350 --> 21:22.400
[Hey, send me a photo of that guy]

21:34.900 --> 21:37.590
If you really got his signature, hang out with me.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.800
I told you I have a boyfriend.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.900
Did I ask to be your boyfriend? I just want to have fun with you for a day.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.350
Even if it's just for a while, I won't hang out with a big mouthed person like you

21:49.400 --> 21:51.300
Do you know me that well?

21:51.950 --> 21:53.500
I don't know you well.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.450
But why?

21:55.900 --> 21:59.200
Anyway. I'm not that kind of person.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.750
What did you came for?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.750
I'm Jin Chul's basketball senior.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.300
This is my wife.

22:24.650 --> 22:25.650
Ah, yes.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.250
What to do, Jin Chul's not here.

22:28.850 --> 22:31.900
The reporters came here too.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.150
Please come and greet inside.

22:49.350 --> 22:53.050
I don't think player Kang is coming. I'll be leaving first.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.850
If I keep on waiting, I'll be late for my presentation.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.050
Just sit there. I'll take you there so you won't be late.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.650
It's an etiquette to eat before leaving at a wake.

23:03.650 --> 23:04.250
What?

23:04.350 --> 23:08.200
You still have to buy me a meal. Let's just say this is your treat.

23:10.750 --> 23:13.800
Okay. I think I'll feel comfortable after this. Let's make it this meal.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.250
No, I'm not drinking.

23:24.350 --> 23:26.300
Sure, just receive it.

23:26.450 --> 23:28.450
I still have to drive too, anyway.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.750
I'm just receiving it.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.050
You have so much things you don't want to do.

23:38.850 --> 23:42.150
Don't worry, I take care of the good things myself.

23:42.250 --> 23:45.100
Ah really? What kind of good things?

23:45.100 --> 23:47.600
- There's a lot.
- Like what, what?

23:47.650 --> 23:49.700
Nevermind. You might just say something again.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.750
I told you I'm not drinking.

24:01.850 --> 24:03.750
Dad...

24:10.300 --> 24:14.600
Dad..

24:31.050 --> 24:33.400
Are you crying?

24:40.350 --> 24:42.200
Why am I like this today?

24:43.600 --> 24:45.600
But.. why did you cry?

24:46.500 --> 24:48.150
I just remembered someone.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.950
Who passed away?

24:52.350 --> 24:53.900
My father.

24:55.950 --> 24:58.700
Ah, I'm sorry.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.900
It's okay. It's been a long time anyway.

25:42.050 --> 25:44.000
Do you come here often in Busan?

25:45.350 --> 25:48.450
I've been in Haeundae with my college friends.

25:48.450 --> 25:55.000
I know a good restaurant called Mujigae Restaurant. Do you want to eat lunch together there after your presentation?

25:55.150 --> 25:58.450
- Their seafood soup is to die for!
- I need to go back to Seoul right after.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.750
I think you're too hardworking in life.

26:03.750 --> 26:04.850
Why?

26:05.500 --> 26:08.000
Is it wrong to live my life in hardwork?

26:08.200 --> 26:09.340
It's like your target is wind.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.600
Why are you so (???)... If you get off the car, no one's gonna see you.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.600
How long have you been dating?

26:18.960 --> 26:19.860
10 years.

26:23.610 --> 26:26.720
Daebak. I didn't know there are still people like that.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.000
What fun did you guys do for 10 years?

26:29.810 --> 26:32.210
Get married to him, if not, just leave.

26:32.210 --> 26:34.210
I will get married to him.

26:34.210 --> 26:36.210
You are because you think you should.

26:36.210 --> 26:41.540
I think you are seeing me as a very frustrating woman just because I declined to have a one night stand with you.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.340
Even If I act like this, you're still rebelling

26:43.340 --> 26:46.000
Okay, but have you ever experienced having a one night stand?

26:50.960 --> 26:54.660
Since when did someone sleeping with only one person became such an embarrassing thing?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.340
This all happened because of men!

26:57.340 --> 27:01.320
'Hey you pathetic girls, it's such a pleasurable thing, why are you staying still there.'

27:01.320 --> 27:04.560
'Don't go, and enjoy it. If you don't you'll look pathetic.'

27:04.760 --> 27:07.400
So, are you satisfied with sleeping with only one man?

27:07.400 --> 27:08.560
Then what about you?

27:09.500 --> 27:11.280
If you do i... i..

27:11.680 --> 27:12.400
Do what?

27:13.120 --> 27:13.940
A-alone..

27:13.940 --> 27:16.720
Say it louder. No one's going to hear you.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.440
What makes it doing it alone better than doing it with woman?

27:25.860 --> 27:26.740
Hey! Be careful!

27:26.780 --> 27:30.520
In the end, you like it better when you do it with a woman.

27:30.540 --> 27:32.540
That's what you call affection.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.540
What I'm saying is...

27:34.820 --> 27:37.990
You have to do it with someone you love, and not just anyone.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.040
You need to be in love, and that's an emotion

27:40.220 --> 27:44.100
I understand. Okay, why can't that just be for one night?

27:48.080 --> 27:55.060
Nevermind. It's a sexual harassment to ask someone you've just met to have a one night stand.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.200
It's a crime!

27:58.360 --> 27:59.880
Isn't taking picture secretly a crime too?

27:59.960 --> 28:00.520
Secretly taking a picture?

28:03.740 --> 28:04.140
Look.

28:06.340 --> 28:07.420
This.

28:07.540 --> 28:09.760
I've taken it mistakenly while that car was moving.

28:09.820 --> 28:12.700
What mistakenly? You took it well.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.700
I just took it accidentally.

28:14.700 --> 28:16.700
Alright then. Here.

28:17.730 --> 28:21.800
Okay. Let's call it quits with this. Call?

28:56.960 --> 28:57.800
I'm leaving.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.740
Soojung. If you have something to want to say, say it now.

29:09.740 --> 29:13.260
We won't ever see each other anyway.

29:14.120 --> 29:17.600
I don't. Do sex a lot and be happy.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.260
Hey.

29:37.700 --> 29:38.640
My phone.

29:43.260 --> 29:46.440
If you perhaps changed your mind, and decided to do it, contact me.

30:01.940 --> 30:04.740
- Miguhara, please prepare.
- Yes.

30:16.380 --> 30:20.280
Where? At the cafe.. do you see a yellow jeep car?

30:20.480 --> 30:25.420
Okay. I saw it. You see a cafe right? take a U-turn from there.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.220
- Alright, wait for me.
- Okay.

30:35.580 --> 30:36.020
What's that?

30:47.860 --> 30:49.080
Hey hey hey.

30:53.900 --> 30:55.300
We, in Miguhara...

30:57.660 --> 31:00.700
- is naturally made and..
- Excuse me?

31:00.860 --> 31:03.260
If you're not going to use the projector, let's turn it off.

31:04.900 --> 31:06.660
Yes, ah...

31:07.380 --> 31:09.760
the new products...

31:26.120 --> 31:29.120
Just like what you see right now, it's different from the other brands.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.780
and you can see a great difference in the satisfation area.

31:45.340 --> 31:49.520
There's an increase of 50% every year.

31:50.600 --> 31:55.600
It says here that player Kang Jin Chul's CF is confirmed, is the contract already done?

31:56.560 --> 31:58.980
In the broadcasts, it says he's just considering it.

31:59.920 --> 32:03.120
- Anyways, player Kang is now in Busan
- In Busan?

32:03.320 --> 32:07.440
Yesterday, I went to pay condolence to player Kang's grandfather.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.540
Team leader, I heard you've made player Kang sign the contract?

32:16.560 --> 32:19.180
I got a call from the department store. Is it real? Really?

32:19.300 --> 32:20.500
It's not a lie, right?!

32:22.740 --> 32:25.620
Then that means we'll now be able to take the 2nd floor in the dept. store? Right?

32:27.280 --> 32:29.420
But how did you meet player Kang?

32:30.420 --> 32:32.820
Is it because of the man you met at the train?

32:33.600 --> 32:36.260
- How is he? Is he sexy?
- I'll call you later.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.340
- Please call me later!
- Okay!

32:49.430 --> 32:51.300
Mister, that place...

33:10.840 --> 33:12.520
How can this happen...

33:22.280 --> 33:24.660
Hey, this is all because of you!

33:24.660 --> 33:26.660
Why is it because of me?

33:26.660 --> 33:28.660
It's because of you looking at those women.

33:28.900 --> 33:32.000
If you have just stopped, then I wouldn't have fallen in there.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.600
Just think that you're lucky that you didn't lose your phone.

33:34.600 --> 33:39.320
I have a precious thing in my wallet. My mom made that for me long time ago.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.660
I smell like poop.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.600
Good restaurant, my ass.

34:47.179 --> 34:48.380
It's delicious.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.590
Auntie, I'm here

35:00.660 --> 35:02.680
How are you?

35:04.400 --> 35:07.380
- Where's Jin Chul?
- Jin Chul just left a while ago.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.380
How can you let him just leave? (not sure, it's busan dialet :c )

35:15.380 --> 35:17.040
It's always like this!

35:17.380 --> 35:19.510
Why can't you just let him be?

35:20.220 --> 35:23.380
Auntie, why are there no people?

35:27.320 --> 35:30.440
- We're eating here!
- Okay!

35:31.020 --> 35:32.060
Seafood soup!

35:53.500 --> 35:54.820
Did you change your mind?

35:55.960 --> 35:57.940
No... that's not it.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.240
There's no people inside the store and I'm was too hungry...

36:02.260 --> 36:04.460
Didn't you come here cause I told you this store?

36:04.940 --> 36:05.500
No.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.000
Then did you come here cause you thought it doesn't exist?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.220
No..

36:11.500 --> 36:14.820
OK! So you did changed your mind.

36:16.320 --> 36:19.080
- Look here. If you ask it again...
- Hello.

36:19.080 --> 36:23.060
I'm Jaehyun's sunbae, Kang Dong Won.

36:25.260 --> 36:31.220
Yes.. hello.. so you still haven't met player Kang?

36:31.400 --> 36:33.500
Ah, she said he just left a while ago.

36:33.640 --> 36:34.440
A while ago...

36:38.400 --> 36:40.640
So you couldn't catch him now?

36:40.800 --> 36:43.340
Don't worry.

36:43.960 --> 36:47.180
Wow, so it's really our Oppa!

36:47.440 --> 36:50.880
Wow, who is this? Isn't it our Songyi!

36:51.140 --> 36:52.540
You've gotten really pretty!

36:52.600 --> 36:53.480
I'm originally pretty!

36:53.580 --> 36:57.920
How can you come to Busan often and not even show up to me. Aren't you being too much?

36:58.060 --> 36:59.440
Forgive us!

36:59.840 --> 37:02.880
Ah right, this is my girlfriend

37:03.280 --> 37:03.950
What?

37:04.320 --> 37:05.420
Really?

37:06.100 --> 37:08.220
No, that's not it.

37:08.220 --> 37:10.160
Aigoo. No? Why not?

37:10.200 --> 37:15.200
- No, I'm not his girlfriend-
- Aigoo, oppa, your girlfriend is such a (??) style.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.200
Why? But still, isn't she's pretty?

37:17.420 --> 37:21.140
Well, who and when was your girlfriend not pretty? Every girlfriend you had was pretty!

37:21.360 --> 37:22.420
I know right?

37:23.060 --> 37:24.820
That woman!

37:25.620 --> 37:27.680
Hey, isn't your skirt too short?

37:32.440 --> 37:34.440
This is to die for!

37:34.660 --> 37:39.840
Aigoo, how can I let you pay? Don't bother, you are my nephew's girlfriend!

37:39.920 --> 37:41.520
- No
- Don't worry about it.

37:41.600 --> 37:45.820
- If you don't let her pay, we'll be sorry, Auntie.
- I just really don't want you to bother.

37:46.140 --> 37:49.760
- I'll send her off
- Come back.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.760
Is she really your Aunt?

37:52.480 --> 37:53.480
Then what am I?

37:55.160 --> 37:56.840
Ah I see.

37:56.880 --> 37:58.380
Hyung, I'll be back.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.040
Aren't you being too much?

38:05.240 --> 38:09.380
How can you fool them and introduce a girl you just once went for, as your girlfriend?

38:09.520 --> 38:11.040
Did I bring you here?

38:12.900 --> 38:14.320
You didn't. But...

38:16.180 --> 38:21.880
How many girls have you brought there that they all have that look on me?

38:22.120 --> 38:24.020
Okay, so you feel bad?

38:25.500 --> 38:27.480
You said you've fallen for me?

38:28.140 --> 38:31.300
Are you like that to every woman you've fallen for?

38:31.380 --> 38:34.580
Well... every girl has a different charm.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.600
So you take advantage of them?

38:38.380 --> 38:42.080
Excuse me. There are a lot more people who are fun to play with, than you.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.700
And, am I the only one having a good time?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.520
It's great for each other, without having commitment.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.200
Haven't you thought about this reason?

38:50.700 --> 38:53.500
There are also people who can mess their life with that one time.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.540
She has to take care of that problem herself. We're all adults.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.160
There's a thing called forgiving in my dictionary.

38:59.500 --> 39:03.640
Okay. I'm saying this all for once.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.980
After all those big words of yours, there's surely going to be a time that you'll get hurt too.

39:06.980 --> 39:07.780
Taxi!

39:14.380 --> 39:15.400
You're going to Busan station, right?

39:15.760 --> 39:17.740
Yes.

39:23.660 --> 39:26.440
Anyway, I'd have to thank you for today.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.500
Do it a lot, and be happy.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.820
Let's go together.

39:33.220 --> 39:34.020
Where?

39:34.280 --> 39:37.960
Didn't you say you're going to Busan station? Just until there, I won't wish for more.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.360
You reaaallllyyy have a lot of determination.

39:42.220 --> 39:44.340
But I will never change my mind!

39:44.340 --> 39:46.980
No, I've already gave up on sleeping with you.

39:47.240 --> 39:48.000
But why?!

39:54.920 --> 39:55.980
Oppa!

39:58.160 --> 39:59.800
Jin Chul was found! Come quick!

40:13.620 --> 40:16.280
Hey! We should go together!

40:22.580 --> 40:24.480
Should you really send Jin Chul to America?

40:25.660 --> 40:28.300
Of course. That opportunity was hard to get.

40:29.880 --> 40:32.740
I know... but...

40:33.800 --> 40:36.200
Don't you think he's different than you?

40:37.120 --> 40:37.980
What?

40:38.160 --> 40:40.560
I think he wants to join the NBA.

40:41.120 --> 40:44.900
Who doesn't want to go to NBA? His life is caught on the line.

40:44.900 --> 40:49.760
- He just haven't thought about it straight.
- To be honest, I think he's just someone who enjoys basketball.

40:50.140 --> 40:54.260
He doesn't dream of being the best, like you.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.500
If you can, please wait for him.

40:58.940 --> 41:00.720
It doesn't hurt to give him some time to think.

41:03.180 --> 41:04.580
Are you listening to me?

41:24.980 --> 41:27.520
Why do you always bring that ball with you?

41:28.580 --> 41:33.080
Ah, It was my gift to Jinchul when he started basketball.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.980
He got it delivered back to me few days ago.

41:37.220 --> 41:40.700
I have to send him to America no matter what, and make him succeed.

41:42.360 --> 41:44.380
Do you know somewhere that's important to him?

41:45.620 --> 41:50.940
There's one, but it's a bit hard to reach... will you be okay?

41:55.520 --> 41:56.340
Move, move!

42:02.900 --> 42:08.600
- Jae... jaehyu-
- He just (left)... that way...

42:10.800 --> 42:14.140
Oh, there, that yellow car. Ahjussi, that one.

42:14.540 --> 42:19.860
What the.. there's a truck in front of us!! Please overtake! Hurry!

42:20.080 --> 42:22.360
Hurry! What are you doing?

42:22.380 --> 42:25.280
Ahjusshi, is it okay to order me around because you have money?

42:25.700 --> 42:28.580
No, but if you don't catch him, I can't pay you.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.440
He will give you the taxi fare.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.100
Ahjusshi, you don't have money?

42:33.100 --> 42:34.160
I don't.

42:37.160 --> 42:44.920
Where's my phone... my phone.. ahjusshi!!!

42:51.980 --> 42:53.320
Will you be okay?

42:55.100 --> 42:57.820
If it will be hard for you, just wait here. I'll come down right away.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.120
Because we don't know when this guy will disappear again.

43:02.240 --> 43:03.660
I can go up too.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.360
Well then, shall we?

43:12.400 --> 43:14.500
You won't perhaps look at my butt, aren't you?

43:15.060 --> 43:16.780
I'm not that kind of person!

43:59.100 --> 44:04.460
Okay. If he contacts you again, call me.

44:05.340 --> 44:06.160
I'll call you. Okay.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.200
Let's go. I think he's not here either.

44:46.220 --> 44:48.500
This place is where Jinchul and I went often before.

44:48.780 --> 44:52.300
I don't know much about basketball, but NBA must be really amazing, right?

44:54.400 --> 44:56.400
Player Kang is a really strange person.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.420
But at the same time, I'm jealous.

45:00.900 --> 45:04.180
To be able to give up that kind of opportunity, for something more special.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.700
But he gave it up for a girl. I'm dumbfounded.

45:06.900 --> 45:12.320
At his age, it could be that love must be his everything. It's not easy to find an innocent love.

45:12.620 --> 45:17.040
It's immaturity. Love will find him endlessly in the future.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.180
Jaehyun?

45:23.800 --> 45:25.280
Oh yeah...

45:25.700 --> 45:26.740
It's Bo Kyung!

45:26.820 --> 45:30.900
Right, Bo Kyung! You've gotten prettier, I didn't even recognize you.

45:30.900 --> 45:32.000
What are you doing here?

45:32.220 --> 45:34.800
Ah, I came here for work.

45:38.500 --> 45:40.300
You've been living well right? How are you?

45:40.300 --> 45:42.100
I've still been teaching. Nothing new.

45:42.100 --> 45:44.280
You've been in charge for the 3rd years this time?

45:44.680 --> 45:46.440
I'm an aerobic trainer.

45:48.640 --> 45:53.800
Right? Hey, I heard 3rd year students does aerobic these days too... for exercise.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.840
They do?  You haven't changed at all.

45:58.920 --> 46:00.320
Did I disturbed you?

46:02.720 --> 46:04.840
No. Not at all.

46:04.900 --> 46:07.160
- Alright, see you.
- Yeah, see you again.

46:11.340 --> 46:14.580
Ah, has she not forgotten me yet?

46:15.600 --> 46:19.460
- Mom!
- Aigoo, my son...

46:23.840 --> 46:25.960
You slept with that woman a while ago, right?

46:27.600 --> 46:28.740
Ah, well...

46:29.020 --> 46:32.880
You slept with a 3rd year teacher too, and you don't remember that woman as well.

46:32.880 --> 46:33.860
Why?

46:34.780 --> 46:39.980
Did you see the look she gave me? "So you're his girl for today?"

46:41.000 --> 46:43.880
At the end of that look, there's something you didn't read.

46:43.960 --> 46:45.060
What?

46:45.060 --> 46:48.100
"That man was the best in bed, though"

46:52.380 --> 46:56.800
You see the hole far there? Jinchul and I put most of the coins in there.

46:56.800 --> 46:57.860
Yeah right.

46:58.720 --> 47:02.860
It's true! I'm still a basketball player even if I'm that kind of person.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.800
You must played basketball in some neighborhood.

47:27.080 --> 47:27.800
That's right!

47:30.280 --> 47:31.020
See that?

47:31.460 --> 47:32.700
Well, it must be your luck.

48:41.600 --> 48:42.640
Are you okay?

48:43.540 --> 48:44.760
It's cold.

48:52.780 --> 48:54.720
Soojung, sit here.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.000
It's okay.

49:02.500 --> 49:03.760
Why?
- Just stay still for a bit.

49:03.980 --> 49:04.940
Why?

49:08.520 --> 49:09.820
Aren't you uncomfortable walking?

49:10.980 --> 49:12.500
What are you doing right now?

49:12.500 --> 49:14.120
Your ankle is strained.

49:15.260 --> 49:17.420
(talking about her Achilles tendon)

49:24.500 --> 49:26.340
Endure it for a bit, even if it hurts.

49:28.440 --> 49:29.940
Do you have (???)?

49:30.320 --> 49:31.960
No, just (??)...

49:32.860 --> 49:34.940
I think it's because I walk a lot.

49:35.480 --> 49:39.460
Even if it looks nothing, it can be serious if you just let it be.

49:40.240 --> 49:45.600
If you work with athletes, there are a lot worse than (???).

49:59.420 --> 50:03.620
Once you come back to Seoul, treat it warmly and rest it.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.000
Okay.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.280
Does it feel better now?

50:19.300 --> 50:21.080
Yes, it's okay now.

50:23.300 --> 50:24.840
The rain has stopped.

50:35.720 --> 50:36.940
Shall we go now?

51:18.040 --> 51:20.020
- Here, this.
- Thank you.

51:20.220 --> 51:21.640
Goodbye!

51:29.300 --> 51:32.160
I think it will be hard to find Jin Chul today.

51:33.920 --> 51:35.060
You're going to Busan station. right?

51:54.560 --> 51:58.060
We're going to share all these in half.

51:58.980 --> 52:01.780
So that no one's carrying all the responsibility.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.980
You didn't have to say something like that.

52:03.980 --> 52:05.900
It's 18,940 won.

52:05.900 --> 52:07.300
- Split payment.
- What?

52:37.960 --> 52:39.340
You might forget about it.

52:44.380 --> 52:48.180
Soojung, you must be nervous...

52:53.620 --> 52:55.280
Why are you in a hurry?

52:56.080 --> 52:56.640
What?

52:59.120 --> 53:01.980
Who was that person who lectured me about affection the whole day?

53:03.280 --> 53:06.280
Even if this a one night stand, let's have some conversations first.

53:06.280 --> 53:07.980
Don't kid!

53:08.740 --> 53:11.120
I've taken so much courage.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.880
Tonight, without any feelings...

53:16.500 --> 53:17.840
Okay. I got it.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.600
We're on the 15th floor. Who will see?

53:47.080 --> 53:50.300
It's just bothering me even before.

53:58.680 --> 53:59.880
Then, shall we?

54:01.080 --> 54:04.160
Should you really ask that?

55:26.380 --> 55:27.380
Soojung.

55:29.460 --> 55:30.240
Yes?

55:30.800 --> 55:34.680
Why did you... decide to sleep with me?

55:39.460 --> 55:41.900
If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to.

55:45.680 --> 55:48.020
I felt that you are a good person.

55:51.460 --> 55:55.620
Me? What made me a good person?

55:58.320 --> 56:01.660
But why do I have to keep saying good things about you?

56:02.000 --> 56:03.440
Who knows?

56:04.040 --> 56:07.920
Then, maybe it'll be left a good memory?

56:14.380 --> 56:15.320
Okay.

56:20.300 --> 56:26.700
Even if you date someone so easily, you seem to only focus on one person at a time.

56:27.400 --> 56:32.360
And when you smiled to the child, it looked so genuine.

56:34.220 --> 56:37.440
No matter how busy you are, you don't forget to eat 3 times a day.

56:39.540 --> 56:41.400
That kind of good person.

56:59.840 --> 57:00.760
Soojung.

57:03.300 --> 57:03.920
Yes?

57:05.280 --> 57:06.720
Why again?

57:08.000 --> 57:08.660
Should we...

57:12.200 --> 57:13.660
enjoy the air outside?

57:16.140 --> 57:17.080
What?

57:21.180 --> 57:22.000
Why?

57:23.420 --> 57:25.100
Did I do something wrong?

57:25.480 --> 57:27.660
No, that's not what I mean...

57:28.820 --> 57:31.140
Then, I'll help you.

57:32.880 --> 57:34.520
I don't think we should do it right now.

57:36.800 --> 57:37.960
Ah, really.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.140
I've even did all those.

57:47.040 --> 57:47.700
What?

57:48.480 --> 57:50.360
I've even came until here. Are you kidding me?

57:50.720 --> 57:52.020
You're playing with me!

57:52.020 --> 57:55.660
No, Soojung.. I... Soojung.

57:55.920 --> 57:59.320
What kind of one night stand is this?

57:59.320 --> 58:02.840
Soojung, wait.

58:02.840 --> 58:05.380
- I think we have a misunderstanding.
- What misunderstanding?

58:05.380 --> 58:10.460
I know you were offended but it's not what you think.

58:10.780 --> 58:12.460
It doesn't matter.

58:12.680 --> 58:15.260
Aren't we just a one night stand?

58:16.300 --> 58:17.800
What I'm saying is...

58:20.020 --> 58:22.740
I don't think we should do it.

58:24.320 --> 58:26.780
I'm really dumbfounded with this person.

58:27.480 --> 58:32.480
Look here. Where did that guy go? The guy who kept asking me all day to do it?

58:34.340 --> 58:37.140
You even went out wearing that.

58:43.320 --> 58:47.500
I only did that, cause I found you too pretty.

58:49.080 --> 58:51.820
Where exactly am I pretty?

58:51.820 --> 58:53.160
When you speak like that,

58:55.140 --> 58:58.920
You act like you aren't going to answer but then you answer them all diligently.

58:58.920 --> 59:01.620
You act like you won't accept it, but when I give you, you take it.

59:01.620 --> 59:03.920
You're not even related to the person at the wake,

59:05.380 --> 59:07.880
but you poured your tears.

59:08.340 --> 59:12.900
You keep on following me, even if you're wearing heels.

59:13.960 --> 59:16.180
Is that what made me pretty?

59:23.140 --> 59:25.700
I have something to go with you, Soojung.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.040
Oh, it's you during college.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.200
So you were really a basketball player.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.580
Are you okay? You've already had a lot earlier.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.360
Tch, you said you weren't going to drink alcohol.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.420
I did?

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.220
Really?

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.380
Yes, I did.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.980
I'm really strange today.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.060
Here.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.160
Cheers!

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.560
You see,

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.120
It hasn't even been 2 months since they dated,

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.320
how can they do that, without even looking at the future?

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.120
Why can't I live the way I want to?

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:18.140
You're being too much on yourself just cause our one night stand failed.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.660
I know.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:28.000
How would you feel... if you break up with your boyfriend?

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.940
It would be unfair.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.540
He's someone I spent with, in my 20s.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.640
The guy I spent with in my teen years is marrying my friend,

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.940
and if the guy I spent with in my 20s is marrying another woman too,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.660
then where do I place myself?

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.620
If you dated and broke up, does that erase the times you spent together?

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.700
How can you date again if you're scared?

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.500
I know that too.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.980
It's just that it's harder than words said.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.300
It's the memories that we spent together for 10 years.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.780
How can I throw that away?

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.800
10 years or 20 years, what does it matter?

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.660
What I'm saying is,

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.900
Just think of today.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.680
Right now. Just this moment.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.380
There are also people who lives forever with that moment.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:33.040
And to those people, it isn't just one day. It could also be their everyday.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.360
How about this.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.900
Let's play.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:56.940
What?

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.080
Sure.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.020
Me first!

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.580
Then... what should we bet for?

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.800
One night stand?

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.120
You're such a coward.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.640
One, two, three.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.920
That's unbelievable.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.680
Player Kim Jaehyun is totally losing today!

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.700
Unbelievable. How can that happen?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.080
What are you going to do with that?

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.680
To do a dunk shoot!

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.760
Dunk shoot?

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.680
I've always wanted to try this.

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.600
There.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.440
Please hand me the ball.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.940
Wow, this is daebak.

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.900
Jaehyun, look. This is really awesome.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.980
Did you let go?

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.020
What?

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.900
You removed your hand?

01:05:58.820 --> 01:05:59.880
Are you okay?

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.180
Why did you let go?

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.540
Let's go. Hurry.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.740
Which punk is it... he didn't even turned the lights off.

01:08:54.979 --> 01:08:56.540
Don't you hear something?

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.140
What did you say?

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.060
You said no one's going to come?

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.100
Ah? But they all went to (??)..

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.600
Wait for a bit.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.060
That scared me. What are you doing here?

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:20.660
Is she a new member?

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.800
Who is it?

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.200
Huh? Yesterday...

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:32.720
Oh, isn't that a man's clothes?

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:39.960
No, this is my clothes. Oh, it's all dry.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.620
It's really a man's clothes.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:53.080
Excuse me.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.340
In the end, we're leaving without meeting him.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:12.380
If I meet Jin Chul, and receive his signature I'll contact...

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.880
How should we do our last greeting?

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.400
How would you want it?

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.260
Should we shake hands?

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.880
Or should we just hug?

01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:29.780
Let's just...

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.320
part like this.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.600
Soojung.

01:11:59.020 --> 01:11:59.900
Goodbye.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.780
You too, Jaehyun. Goodbye.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.480
I went to Seoul. To meet you.

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.400
How do you feel? Are you okay?

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.640
He's always someone who's a (???).

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.580
Right. He must've gone to a good place now.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.520
Hyung.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.200
I don't need money.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.960
Who said you're going there for money?

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.980
Aren't you doing this for money? Even the agency too.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:01.520
Jin Chul, this opportunity doesn't come so often.
Do you think it's right that you're giving this up for a girl?

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.660
Hyung, it's not just a girl. She's someone I love. You know that too.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.120
If not for my girlfriend, I wouldn't have come this far.

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:09.980
Jin Chul.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.760
Hyung, just not right now. I'll come with you after a few years.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.900
Hyung, you were the one who shaped me. But I'm at the right age to decide on my own.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.860
Team leader, we're going off first.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:49.660
- We're leaving first.
- Okay. You've worked hard.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.440
Busy?

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.360
I'm back.

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:22.880
When do you finish?

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:25.980
Should I bring the laptop there?

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.200
Jinchul.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.160
I'm not going to send him to America.

01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.980
That's not something you decide on your own, you punk!

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:01.820
So? If (something something) happened, will you take responsibilty?

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.120
Do you want to ruin yourself, by continuing this?

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.820
Jaehyun, hand me Jin Chul's contract.

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.020
I've teared it.

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:19.920
Why?

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.740
Do you think the guys you brought here are just one or two? (not sure >_<)

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.820
I'm not working here for money.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.580
Jaehyun.

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.000
Hey, Kim Jaehyun. Hey!

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.260
We've been together for 10 years.

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:09.660
Yeah.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:14.700
During those years,

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.760
What kind of girlfriend was I to you?

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:24.460
Why are you suddenly like that?

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.700
During the 10 years,

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.440
What kind of girl was I to you?

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.240
What do you mean?

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:50.420
Ah, really.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.940
Let's break up.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.600
Did I really just asked us to break up?

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:08.720
You would've done the same, right?

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.740
Right.

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:17.020
Let's break up.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.200
Let's part ways, oppa.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.400
I don't want both of us to get hurt.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.400
It's hard not being able to tell that we're having a hard time. Let's not make it hard for each other anymore.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.940
We're ending it here, but that won't make our happy memories disappear.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.940
If you have something to say, say it quickly.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.740
If you're going to thank me, just leave.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:00.400
Hyung.

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.820
I heard you left the company?

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.200
The gossip is fast.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.520
I came to sign with you.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.580
You once said, if you're confused, go with your first thought.

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:20.980
Hyung, I'm still a top star, even not for the NBA.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.720
And you know it, I couldn't do anything with anyone but you.

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.320
Do me the favor, hyung.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.240
Do me the favor, hyung.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:37.820
Here.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.080
Here.

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:51.060
What is this?

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.700
There's something like that, punk.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.760
I came to find Bae Soojung.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.700
She just left.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.780
Did you already contact her?

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.900
No, I haven't.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.580
Can you give this to her?

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:22.360
Sure.

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.120
Can I borrow a memo?

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.800
Did you really... break up?

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.240
But what did you say when you asked him?

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.820
- Hey, why are you asking that?
- Why?

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:49.340
I'm just curious how special did a 10 year relationship ended.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.560
I didn't say much.

01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:57.220
It might be a little late, but you did well on breaking up with him. Good job.

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:59.640
Are you okay?

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.420
Well... it's okay.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.740
What about that guy? Did you contact him?

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.640
- No
- Why?

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.680
Was it bad?

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:18.760
It was good.

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.360
It was good but why?

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:22.820
Well...

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.040
You haven't forgotten that guy, am I right?

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.640
- No
- What No?

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:34.920
I know this would happen. That guy doesn't care about you and you're the only one thinking about him

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.640
And that's why you broke up with your boyfriend.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.400
And now you're regretting it.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.780
It's not like that.

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.180
Hey. Contact him right away.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.180
You can sleep freely with other men now!

01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.660
It's just a one night stand.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.540
We met for that.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.780
You're an unbelievably cool girl.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.100
So, you're really not going to meet him again?

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.500
It wasn't that memorable to me.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.900
It was a meaningless night.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:31.320
I must be an expert with one night stand.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:38.080
Yeah right, you can be single now, meet a couple of guys and have a chic relationship.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.340
I will.

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:44.600
Thinking about it, it's not much of a big deal.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:49.220
Woah, Bae Soojung.

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.780
You've finally became true to yourself now.

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.120
What are you doing here?

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.300
I have someone to see.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.940
That possibly can't be me, right?

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.540
You're right. It's you.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.360
What is it about?

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.380
How about tonight?

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:53.780
Thinking about it, it doesn't really have to be just one night.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.400
What?

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.520
I'm talking about you and me.

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:04.280
Sometimes, it's okay to enjoy it lightly.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.380
I thought that we matched really well.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.940
What do you mean?

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:13.480
Should I repeat it?

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.480
Were you this kind of person?

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.120
So I've really mistaken you.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:23.920
I'm leaving.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.800
Do you know me that well?

01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:33.940
We only met for just one day.

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:37.880
You're right.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.280
I've mistaken.

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:42.840
I'm sorry,

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.740
and thank you,

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:48.540
for coming here and kindly explaining to me.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:50.960
Yeah.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.660
Keep living your life erasing ((memories?)).

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.720
Like that day,

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.860
I'm also going to disappear from you.

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.800
Team leader, we've got advertisment schedule from Kang Jin Chul's agency.

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:33.260
We've got the 2nd floor from the department store!

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.920
And this, I got this from the helpdesk.

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.940
I'm signing off after lunch.

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:10.980
Hyung

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.800
I know.

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:21.500
that I am very strange right now.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.600
Yeah, you punk.

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.140
You aren't really like yourself, this time.

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:29.520
But.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.620
I hate her so much.

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.600
I'm angry.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.820
but I'm also very curious about her.

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.620
I am bothered by her.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.720
Who?

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:51.340
Jin Chul?

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:04.240
Don't tell me... a girl...

01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:09.760
Why are you being like this because of a girl!

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.460
The manly Kim Jaehyun?!

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.360
The problem is you're such a show-off.

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:56.000
Why are you out here in other people's neighborhood?

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:03.500
That day...

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.780
It was such a strange day.

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.300
Since morning, a ball flew over,

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.040
and hit my head.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:23.420
I've even wore a red heels that I never wore in my life.

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.980
Yoonjoo announced his marriage with my first love.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.080
In the train, some guy asked me to sleep with him

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.660
and then I actually did.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.340
It was really a strange day.

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:53.220
As if it was made to be like that.

01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.020
Meet him again, that guy.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.800
I met him.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.940
But I messed it up.

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:10.100
Because It might be painful.

01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.580
Because I might get hurt again.

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:23.640
It's okay.

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.380
I feel really stupid.

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:08.880
Right? I'm really stupid.

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.040
I'm stupid.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.420
It's okay.

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.620
Team leader, here's your coffee.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.860
You bought a new laptop?

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:55.560
Yeah.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.620
After saying that you don't want to throw your memories away...

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:04.220
I've gathered all the memories and loyalty and put it here. Why? Can't I do that?

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:05.420
You can, you can.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.080
You did well!

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:19.820
Team leader-

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:23.800
Your lover was really cool.

01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.160
Lover?

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.700
[CEO Kim Jae Hyun, Kang Jin Chul were disclosed as having donated the full amount of charity match advertising revenue to children's basketball teams]

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.560
I actually saw what's written on the note(?).

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:42.080
What was it again?

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:44.340
Note?

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:50.580
After seeing the note, I was moved. So I gave him the name of the cafe where you went to.

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:37.580
[I wish we could make that day, our everyday.]

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.020
Hey, are you done yet?

01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.880
Yeah, it's done.

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.400
You're going here right? There's not much time left til it's done.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.600
Hyung, I'm going to Chicago today, remember?

01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.860
You're going by plane, so you can come there slowly by train.

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.700
Everyone's excited cause you're coming at 3pm. (?)

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:13.860
Take care of it hyung. I'll still have to stop by somewhere.

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.380
Come. If not, you'll regret it.

01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:17.800
Why would I?

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:22.560
The thing is, this girl from the make up company is coming for the event.

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:29.080
Nevermind. Don't come. Anyways, come back safely.

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:52.080
I'm sorry, I'll take it first. Sorry.

01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:20.860
Team lead-

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.120
Jaehyun?

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.020
What?

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.740
Where is Jaehyun?

01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:07.030
[If you're confused, go with your first thought - Kim Jae Hyun]

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.220
That day...

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.620
All those things I said at the cafe, were all lies.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.760
To say that...

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.380
you came all the way here?

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.240
Today..

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:07.220
If you're fine with it, I'm going to sleep with you.

01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:20.320
Hey there! Hey...

01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:21.880
Why..

01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.400
Is she okay?

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.260
Why? A girl that you know?

01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:27.800
Huh? No...

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.540
Let's go.

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.880
(Keep watching!! XD)

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:48.360
What's with this? Really..

01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.420
Ah, yes.

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.060
Excuse me.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.800
If you're fine with it, I'm going to sleep with you.
