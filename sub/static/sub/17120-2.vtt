WEBVTT

00:00.297 --> 00:03.217
'Do you know the name Alice Webster?'
'She was abducted in spring 2003.'

00:06.141 --> 00:09.710
'Yesterday, she came back.
Walked into the town square.'

00:11.027 --> 00:14.804
What's happened to her, Sam?
Where the hell has she been?

00:14.829 --> 00:17.909
There's a name she mentioned when the
paramedics asked who they could call.

00:17.909 --> 00:19.669
She said the name Sophie Giroux.

00:19.669 --> 00:22.149
Sophie Giroux?

00:22.149 --> 00:25.549
This is a Photofit of the man
who took Alice and Sophie.

00:25.549 --> 00:28.149
It will be in every newspaper by
the evening edition.

00:28.149 --> 00:32.389
I have over 5,000 men and women in
this garrison ready to help.

00:33.789 --> 00:36.349
'I need to find someone
to drive me to Azwya.'

00:36.349 --> 00:39.509
Across an active warzone. That's a
pretty good way to get yourself killed.

00:39.509 --> 00:41.749
I must find this man - Daniel Reed.

00:43.869 --> 00:48.069
Henry Reed was a soldier,
but a father first.

00:48.069 --> 00:50.109
He leaves behind his son Daniel.

00:51.549 --> 00:54.029
Do you ever feel like your family
is slipping away from you?

00:57.749 --> 01:03.229
I believe that girl was not
Alice Webster.

02:03.617 --> 02:05.137
Mrs Giroux.

02:06.217 --> 02:08.984
Julien, leave me alone.

02:08.984 --> 02:11.384
I promise you,
I haven't given up on Sophie.

02:11.384 --> 02:14.584
I won't give up until
I find your daughter.

02:14.584 --> 02:15.944
Do you believe that?

02:17.584 --> 02:22.944
Mrs Giroux, however bad things
seem now... it will get better.

03:00.784 --> 03:07.824
♪ Oh, my love, we pray each day

03:07.824 --> 03:15.744
♪ May you come home and be OK

03:22.584 --> 03:27.624
♪ For now we wait for you

03:27.624 --> 03:31.624
♪ For you to come home. ♪

04:08.584 --> 04:11.064
- You OK?
- Yeah.

04:12.464 --> 04:13.944
Did you sleep?

04:16.584 --> 04:18.103
Not really.

04:19.784 --> 04:21.584
It's strange, isn't it?

04:22.904 --> 04:25.864
Having another set of footsteps in
the house after all this time.

04:25.864 --> 04:29.544
Yeah. We used to be able to tell,
didn't we,

04:29.544 --> 04:32.784
who was going past the bedroom,
just by their footsteps.

04:32.784 --> 04:35.464
She'd always take them two
at a time, wouldn't she?

04:35.464 --> 04:37.504
Always in such a rush.

04:46.424 --> 04:48.464
I've thought about it so many times.

04:48.464 --> 04:51.104
What it would be like,
if she ever came back.

04:52.464 --> 04:57.104
I suppose somehow I expected it
would just be the same as before.

04:58.544 --> 05:00.824
It's going to take a while
before she's back to herself.

05:03.784 --> 05:05.864
Before any of us are.

05:08.944 --> 05:15.544
But, in time, we'll recognise
those footsteps again.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.704
I promise you.

05:39.984 --> 05:41.784
Are you all right, my love?

05:43.584 --> 05:45.064
Do you want me to...?

05:45.064 --> 05:47.024
Would you like a cup of tea?

05:47.024 --> 05:48.264
No.

05:48.264 --> 05:51.224
No, thank you.

05:55.504 --> 05:57.184
I just need to...

06:19.224 --> 06:21.504
I've just got so many questions
I want to ask,

06:21.504 --> 06:23.744
but I keep stopping myself.

06:24.864 --> 06:27.624
You can ask me things, you know.

06:30.104 --> 06:35.544
Well, I was... I was just going to
ask you how you slept, that's all.

06:35.544 --> 06:36.904
I didn't.

06:42.544 --> 06:43.744
Yeah. I'm sorry.

06:58.304 --> 07:00.784
Good morning.
What's going on?

07:00.784 --> 07:02.544
My name is Julien Baptiste.

07:02.544 --> 07:06.784
In 2002, a girl called Sophie Giroux
was abducted in Paris

07:06.784 --> 07:08.624
and I investigated her case.

07:08.624 --> 07:13.264
I have been informed your daughter
Alice was held captive with her.

07:13.264 --> 07:15.464
If I could speak with Alice...

07:15.464 --> 07:18.304
We've only just got our daughter
back. She needs some time alone.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.744
She's got people coming round today
that she needs to talk to,

07:20.744 --> 07:23.584
so that's what's important. I hope
you understand... Yes, of course,

07:23.584 --> 07:26.224
but there is a man just like you,
whose daughter was taken from him.

07:26.224 --> 07:28.304
Only this man continues to live

07:28.304 --> 07:31.024
with the uncertainty
you must know so well.

07:31.024 --> 07:35.544
That ever-present hope that today
might be the day the telephone rings.

07:35.544 --> 07:38.744
That somebody has called to say,
"We've found her".

07:38.744 --> 07:40.704
The man's name is Remy Giroux.

07:40.704 --> 07:42.264
He's Sophie's father.

07:43.704 --> 07:46.744
Please, let me talk to Alice.

07:50.984 --> 07:52.624
You must be tired.

07:54.544 --> 07:58.744
I know the last thing you feel like
is answering more questions.

07:58.744 --> 08:01.824
I'm just here to ask
about Sophie Giroux.

08:03.944 --> 08:06.984
I don't know what more
I can say about her.

08:06.984 --> 08:09.704
Why didn't she escape with you?

08:20.024 --> 08:23.824
When I got ill, it happened so fast.

08:23.824 --> 08:25.424
But Sophie...

08:26.984 --> 08:29.744
She'd been ill for a while.

08:29.744 --> 08:34.144
He kept her away from me, mostly.
In the dark.

08:34.144 --> 08:38.063
Sometimes he wouldn't feed her
for days on end

08:38.063 --> 08:40.624
because she'd talk back.

08:40.624 --> 08:44.384
She argued with him and
he hated that.

08:45.784 --> 08:49.264
She could hardly talk or stand.

08:50.304 --> 08:53.984
Then when I found the lock
was open...

08:56.904 --> 08:59.504
..I tried to help her to her feet,
but she couldn't.

09:01.304 --> 09:03.784
I promised that I would get help.

09:03.784 --> 09:07.184
She didn't even have the energy
to move when I left.

09:08.624 --> 09:10.384
And the place you escaped from?

09:10.384 --> 09:12.864
It was underground, I think.

09:12.864 --> 09:19.332
But the light was so bright
when I got out so I just ran.

09:22.864 --> 09:28.184
Well, perhaps if you were to return
to the woods, you might recall.

09:28.184 --> 09:30.704
You might find the place
you ran from.

09:30.704 --> 09:34.424
In her state? She's only just
come out of the hospital

09:34.424 --> 09:36.504
and we have spoken to
the police about this.

09:36.504 --> 09:39.024
Sophie was your friend.
If she's still alive...

09:39.024 --> 09:41.224
Look, I hate to say this, but
whoever did this, he'd know

09:41.224 --> 09:43.864
that Alice is gone, so he would
have moved the other girl already.

09:43.864 --> 09:46.504
Now, what's important is for my
daughter to get better, so...

09:46.504 --> 09:48.104
Of course.

09:48.104 --> 09:51.864
But if your abductor was in a hurry,
perhaps he left something.

09:51.864 --> 09:52.904
I don't know.

09:52.904 --> 09:57.544
You must realise, Alice, you are the only
one who can help us find your friend.

09:57.544 --> 09:59.184
I don't know.

09:59.184 --> 10:01.424
How long before you
reached the road?

10:01.424 --> 10:02.944
I've already been through this

10:02.944 --> 10:04.944
All right, Mr Baptiste.
That's enough, now.

10:04.944 --> 10:07.064
And I don't remember, OK?

10:07.064 --> 10:09.184
It's time for you to leave, OK?

10:12.944 --> 10:15.624
Oi, do you hear me?

10:15.624 --> 10:17.024
Are you listening?

10:19.584 --> 10:21.024
Yes.

10:21.024 --> 10:22.384
Forgive me.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.904
Thank you...

10:26.904 --> 10:28.464
Alice.

10:57.064 --> 10:58.384
Ja, ja. Danke.

10:58.384 --> 11:02.376
Danke. Wiedersehen.

11:03.984 --> 11:06.904
- Poor Agata.
- Mm.

11:06.904 --> 11:09.744
There is something going round.
That's all.

11:09.744 --> 11:11.624
She'll be fine.

11:11.624 --> 11:15.144
I mean having to put up
with that man as a husband.

11:15.144 --> 11:16.824
You have to put up with me.

11:19.784 --> 11:22.224
Size of a bloody auroch, that thing.

11:25.904 --> 11:28.144
Ah! Something you don't know!

11:29.944 --> 11:32.424
They were a large breed of cattle,

11:32.424 --> 11:35.184
went extinct back in
the 1600s, apparently.

11:35.184 --> 11:36.944
Horns up to a metre long.

11:38.184 --> 11:39.824
Aggressive bastards.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.624
Goering tried to genetically
engineer them

11:42.624 --> 11:45.224
back into existence
during World War II.

11:45.224 --> 11:48.224
Tried to turn them into
a symbol of the party, apparently.

11:48.224 --> 11:50.464
People do the strangest things.

11:51.944 --> 11:54.344
You always surprise me.

11:54.344 --> 11:55.904
Well, I...

11:55.904 --> 11:58.144
fell in love with a butcher.

11:58.144 --> 11:59.999
I had to do my research.

12:00.024 --> 12:05.104
Find some common ground before I
came over and talked to him...

12:05.104 --> 12:08.304
So... you were stalking me, hmm?

12:08.304 --> 12:10.323
Trying to seduce me.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.624
Maybe... a little bit.

12:18.624 --> 12:20.224
So, what did you find?

12:23.144 --> 12:25.944
I haven't figured it out yet.

12:29.304 --> 12:30.744
Andreas?

12:54.624 --> 12:56.104
Hello?

12:56.104 --> 12:57.824
It's me, your loving husband.

12:57.824 --> 12:59.944
How are you?

13:05.424 --> 13:08.224
Do you remember when
Sophie Giroux went missing?

13:08.224 --> 13:09.704
Yeah. How could I not?

13:09.704 --> 13:11.344
There was this video...

13:11.344 --> 13:14.624
Every time there was a report on the
news, they would play this clip.

13:14.624 --> 13:19.984
I had a copy of that video
in with my case files, in the attic.

13:19.984 --> 13:22.504
Would you send it to me?

13:22.504 --> 13:25.384
Well, I could...
If I could find it...

13:25.384 --> 13:26.904
But I'm sure it's online.

13:29.624 --> 13:30.824
OK.

13:30.824 --> 13:34.744
For your next birthday, I'm going to
buy you a computer course.

13:36.144 --> 13:37.544
Right...

13:37.544 --> 13:40.224
There's bound to be some
news reports from the time

13:40.224 --> 13:43.104
knocking around somewhere,
it's going to be a lot easier

13:43.104 --> 13:47.144
than me trawling through that mess
in the attic... Ah!

13:47.144 --> 13:48.904
Voila.

13:48.904 --> 13:50.344
Voila quoi?

13:50.344 --> 13:51.504
Here...

13:51.504 --> 13:53.744
Check your e-mail.
Then click on the link.

14:07.704 --> 14:09.504
So, how's it going out there?

14:10.704 --> 14:13.584
We are just at the beginning.

14:16.024 --> 14:18.064
I love you.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.368
We're all set.

15:07.393 --> 15:10.024
For only 500,
you too can enter a warzone.

15:11.304 --> 15:13.704
So the officer says there was
a lot of fighting

15:13.704 --> 15:14.944
around al-Mazwaa yesterday.

15:14.944 --> 15:17.664
He says if we stick to the north
and follow this road,

15:17.664 --> 15:20.864
then we should be within areas
controlled by the Peshmerga.

15:20.864 --> 15:24.944
But right now, the larger villages
to the south - Hawija, Abbasi -

15:24.944 --> 15:26.664
are all being held by Isil.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.424
It changes every second,

15:28.424 --> 15:31.104
Isil are pushing north
for more territory.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.584
Look, I say we head
straight for Azwya,

15:33.584 --> 15:36.584
no stopping, and if there's anything
at all, anything that

15:36.584 --> 15:38.639
has us second-guessing ourselves,
we turn back.

15:39.354 --> 15:42.024
I wouldn't have it any other way.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.424
And you're sure this guy...
Daniel Reed?

15:44.424 --> 15:47.064
Yeah, Daniel Reed. Is he worth it?

15:47.064 --> 15:50.304
If we find Daniel Reed,
we will find who took those girls.

15:51.904 --> 15:53.064
It's a long story.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.304
We have plenty of time.

15:59.944 --> 16:02.744
But first... and foremost...

16:05.264 --> 16:07.064
What is this?

16:07.064 --> 16:10.864
Bhangra. My wife got me into it,
She's Punjabi.

16:10.864 --> 16:12.424
It is very loud.

16:12.424 --> 16:14.344
I'm sorry. It's non-negotiable.

16:35.424 --> 16:38.064
Do you have to rush off?
I've got the room all day.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.184
And what a room

16:40.184 --> 16:41.904
I'll let you book it next time.

16:44.944 --> 16:47.624
We could come back tomorrow morning.
Gemma's at school...

16:47.624 --> 16:49.664
Not that she asks where
I'm going these days...

16:49.664 --> 16:51.984
I know. I don't want to talk about
your family, Sam.

16:51.984 --> 16:54.944
Any more than you want to hear
me talk about the baby.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.264
OK?

17:14.464 --> 17:16.263
Thanks.

17:16.263 --> 17:18.743
You write. Please?

17:18.743 --> 17:20.824
The guest book.
We insist...

17:20.824 --> 17:22.584
Well, I haven't got a pen, so...

17:22.584 --> 17:23.904
Ah, here.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.384
Thank you...

17:34.544 --> 17:35.584
..Mr Jones.

18:10.984 --> 18:12.944
This is Azwya?

18:12.944 --> 18:14.584
Should be.

18:54.504 --> 18:55.904
It's quiet.

18:55.904 --> 18:57.334
Yeah.

18:58.264 --> 19:01.264
I saw a few of these last
time I was in these parts.

19:02.344 --> 19:03.704
Ghost villages.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.424
Caught in the crossfire.

19:08.264 --> 19:10.544
Wherever your boy Daniel Reed is,

19:10.544 --> 19:13.104
I don't think he's here.
Not any more.

19:13.104 --> 19:15.304
We have come this far.
We must look.

19:26.024 --> 19:27.744
So if this girl
wasn't Alice Webster,

19:27.744 --> 19:29.464
who was she?

19:31.544 --> 19:34.304
I studied Sophie Giroux,
for years and years.

19:35.824 --> 19:38.424
There is a gesture she makes -
a nervous habit.

19:39.464 --> 19:42.504
This girl, Alice,
made the same gesture.

19:42.504 --> 19:45.224
So you think Alice
was really Sophie?

19:46.224 --> 19:47.704
Because of a gesture?

19:49.864 --> 19:52.944
Such things are unconscious habits.

19:52.944 --> 19:54.544
We do not know we do them.

19:55.984 --> 19:58.944
When I saw this, I thought of
photographs of the girls

19:58.944 --> 20:01.544
when they were taken.

20:01.544 --> 20:04.504
Even at that age,
they could have been sisters.

20:06.624 --> 20:09.784
The abductor was looking for
a specific physical type.

20:11.584 --> 20:12.824
What about the accent?

20:14.784 --> 20:17.504
Sophie's mother was English.

20:17.504 --> 20:20.651
The girls spent almost
half their lives

20:20.676 --> 20:22.996
with only each other for company.

20:23.584 --> 20:27.270
Is it impossible they should
become like one another?

20:30.544 --> 20:33.304
And what? Alice's parents, they...

20:33.304 --> 20:35.064
They just accept it?

20:36.344 --> 20:39.664
Have you never fooled yourself
into believing something,

20:39.664 --> 20:42.464
just because you wanted it
so much to be true?

20:44.824 --> 20:48.064
Yeah, but I don't understand.
Why would anyone...

20:48.064 --> 20:49.704
Why would anyone...

20:53.304 --> 20:55.944
Shit! That's an Isil flag.

21:11.984 --> 21:14.304
Miss Stone, please...

21:18.664 --> 21:21.702
I am sorry. It is too hard.

21:22.504 --> 21:25.024
He pushed me. I cannot.

21:26.544 --> 21:28.184
I understand.

21:29.784 --> 21:32.464
Can you stay
until I find another nurse?

21:34.464 --> 21:36.144
Two weeks. Thank you.

21:41.904 --> 21:43.344
Dad?

22:05.104 --> 22:06.304
Morning.

22:08.824 --> 22:10.424
Watching this again?

22:10.424 --> 22:13.944
This is the first film I ever saw.

22:13.919 --> 22:17.959
I was just a boy.
My father took me to the cinema.

22:17.984 --> 22:20.383
He had his arm in a sling
at the time.

22:20.408 --> 22:23.472
He'd broken it,
so he took the day off work.

22:23.544 --> 22:29.207
I remember when it started. These
figures, larger than life, appeared

22:29.232 --> 22:31.603
doing impossible, heroic things.

22:34.184 --> 22:36.824
I couldn't take my eyes off
that screen.

22:38.384 --> 22:41.664
And when we left the cinema,
I talked a thousand miles an hour

22:41.664 --> 22:44.144
about how brave the people were.

22:44.144 --> 22:48.464
And he looked at me,
at how entranced I was by it all,

22:48.464 --> 22:50.664
and he said,

22:50.664 --> 22:54.904
"Son, how do you think
I broke my arm?"

22:55.888 --> 22:59.304
He told me he was there,
in the movie

22:59.304 --> 23:01.784
and that I'd missed him
in the background

23:01.784 --> 23:03.664
fighting alongside the others.

23:08.024 --> 23:11.184
I made my daughter, Eve,
watch it when she was a girl...

23:16.304 --> 23:17.584
Dad...

23:20.184 --> 23:21.864
It's me. It's Eve.

23:24.784 --> 23:28.118
Yes. Yes, of course. I know.

23:39.064 --> 23:40.624
Engel. Brigadier Stone...

23:40.624 --> 23:42.064
Any luck with the Photofit?

23:42.064 --> 23:44.664
It is with every major news outlet,
in all the papers,

23:44.664 --> 23:46.449
and with every police department.

23:46.474 --> 23:49.104
The media might be more interested
if we could tell them

23:49.104 --> 23:51.024
what this man was wanted
in connection with.

23:51.024 --> 23:53.744
Miss Webster needs her
privacy right now.

23:53.744 --> 23:56.984
- Where are we with the search?
- The area is significant.

23:56.984 --> 23:59.744
We have covered only a small part of
the woods around the town.

23:59.744 --> 24:03.104
Based on the girl's description,
we are estimating at least...

24:04.830 --> 24:06.186
Mrs Webster...?

24:10.464 --> 24:14.332
Yes, of course. But... You're sure?

24:16.344 --> 24:17.217
Right.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.144
Thank you.
I'll call right back.

24:20.144 --> 24:23.624
- ..into the forest...
- That was Gemma Webster.

24:23.624 --> 24:26.344
Alice says she's ready to help us
find the place she was kept.

24:27.544 --> 24:28.824
Right, then, let's go.

24:52.984 --> 24:55.104
Thank you for bringing me, Sergeant.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.007
You don't have to do this, you know?

25:05.624 --> 25:08.304
I mean, the psychologists are
coming, you just need to get better.

25:08.304 --> 25:10.504
Or take me or your mum with you.

25:10.504 --> 25:11.944
You're going to need someone...

25:11.944 --> 25:14.304
I don't want you to...

25:14.304 --> 25:15.744
be there.

25:25.219 --> 25:28.264
Alice! Alice, look what I found.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.504
Right. Yeah.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.544
Don't you recognise it?

25:41.864 --> 25:45.344
You made it for me.
Just before your 10th birthday.

25:46.784 --> 25:48.669
Oh. Yeah.

25:50.064 --> 25:51.504
With your art teacher.

25:51.504 --> 25:52.864
Miss Hammond.

25:55.144 --> 25:56.904
Don't you mean Mrs Barker?

25:58.664 --> 26:00.685
Oh, yeah.

26:01.711 --> 26:03.351
My mistake.

26:04.104 --> 26:09.464
Alice, are you ready?
We'll take good care of her.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.504
It's quite some way from Eckhausen.

27:08.504 --> 27:11.104
To walk that journey in
the state she was in...

27:13.824 --> 27:15.384
..it's not an easy task.

27:16.730 --> 27:21.388
It's amazing what people can do when
they're trying to just stay alive.

27:42.836 --> 27:45.624
- You OK?
- It's from an old case.

27:45.624 --> 27:49.704
There are good days and bad,
you know. And you?

27:51.584 --> 27:54.370
I'm pregnant, not disabled.

27:59.944 --> 28:03.464
I hear you went to see Alice,
right before she called us.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.504
What is it with you and
the Giroux case?

28:05.504 --> 28:10.264
I wonder - has anybody performed
a DNA test on Alice Webster?

28:10.264 --> 28:13.584
There was no need.
Her own parents identified her.

28:13.584 --> 28:16.144
It's only standard procedure
if you can't get an ID.

28:16.144 --> 28:19.504
Perhaps if you asked her parents for
something - a lock of hair maybe.

28:19.504 --> 28:21.024
Just to be sure...

28:21.024 --> 28:22.744
What's going on, Baptiste?

28:22.744 --> 28:25.064
I spoke with Alice Webster.

28:25.064 --> 28:27.064
There was something about her.

28:27.064 --> 28:28.584
The girl is lying.

28:28.584 --> 28:30.616
What would she have to lie about?

28:30.726 --> 28:32.504
I can't be sure. But...

28:32.504 --> 28:33.824
It doesn't make sense.

28:40.664 --> 28:42.424
She's picking up the pace.

29:20.264 --> 29:21.464
Sam...

29:23.824 --> 29:25.344
..does she seem...

29:26.464 --> 29:28.544
..different to you?

29:28.544 --> 29:31.344
Of course. How could she not be
after what she's been through?

29:32.348 --> 29:33.544
But she'll get better.

29:33.569 --> 29:36.729
Yeah, it's just... When I gave
her the scarf, she was...

29:40.085 --> 29:41.051
What?

29:46.573 --> 29:47.486
Nothing.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.184
I thought when we had her back...

29:57.004 --> 29:59.824
Well, it's all we've ever wanted,
isn't it?

30:02.864 --> 30:04.344
But now she's back...

30:07.024 --> 30:08.784
..and the way she is now...

30:10.344 --> 30:11.624
But she is back.

30:14.224 --> 30:16.704
And that's all that matters,
isn't it?

30:27.704 --> 30:30.024
Pass auf,
wir gehen gleich zusammen da runter.

30:30.024 --> 30:31.664
What is this?

30:31.664 --> 30:35.784
Looks like an old World War II
bunker. They're all over Germany.

30:35.784 --> 30:38.544
No-one ever bothered
to seal them off.

30:38.544 --> 30:41.304
They must have missed it
in the original search.

32:18.264 --> 32:19.624
Must be hard.

32:21.384 --> 32:23.504
It was brave of you to come back.

32:30.144 --> 32:31.624
Sophie...

32:37.944 --> 32:40.344
I knew her parents
when she was taken.

32:41.904 --> 32:44.504
It was a tragedy,
what happened to her mother.

32:51.664 --> 32:54.452
Julien!
Julien, they're coming up.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.544
Excuse me.

33:27.384 --> 33:29.784
There's somebody here. I'll go.

33:33.824 --> 33:35.297
Hello.

33:35.664 --> 33:37.384
You're Henry Reed's son.

33:38.584 --> 33:39.984
I'm sorry about your dad.

33:39.984 --> 33:41.570
I saw you at the funeral.

33:42.224 --> 33:43.584
That's why I'm here.

33:44.584 --> 33:47.264
I'm speaking to
everyone that knew him.

33:47.264 --> 33:49.384
I didn't know him all that well.

33:49.384 --> 33:51.144
They say he killed himself.

33:51.144 --> 33:53.024
Only, he didn't have any reason to.

33:53.191 --> 33:56.593
Me, if I was collecting
my armed forces pension,

33:56.618 --> 34:01.778
that shitty amount for risking my life
on behalf of some shirt in Whitehall...

34:02.624 --> 34:03.984
me, I'd be tempted.

34:05.344 --> 34:08.351
But not my dad. He was happy.

34:10.623 --> 34:12.554
So I've been going through
his stuff,

34:13.704 --> 34:15.384
trying to find something.

34:17.882 --> 34:20.664
And... he kept a diary.

34:20.664 --> 34:22.143
And you're in it.

34:25.344 --> 34:29.424
Probably not the nicest account
of me, I would imagine. I...

34:29.424 --> 34:30.944
I had a reputation.

34:32.623 --> 34:36.024
Every day on ops,
he'd write in this diary.

34:36.024 --> 34:38.543
Every day, no exception.

34:38.543 --> 34:41.424
Except when he fought
in Iraq in 1991.

34:44.024 --> 34:45.424
It just stops.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.543
So, what happened?

34:49.304 --> 34:53.103
Being in combat changes you.
You'll learn soon enough.

34:53.103 --> 34:55.184
Don't patronise me.

34:59.544 --> 35:00.944
You're all the same.

35:02.824 --> 35:04.264
Officers.

35:05.344 --> 35:06.984
You're a bunch of idiots.

35:06.984 --> 35:09.384
You're in pain. I understand.

35:10.944 --> 35:13.864
But you can't talk to me
like that, trooper.

35:16.344 --> 35:18.424
You're not in the Army any more.

35:20.824 --> 35:22.544
You don't give me orders.

35:37.224 --> 35:38.744
Who was that?

36:08.384 --> 36:11.624
It looks like no-one's been
down here since it was built.

36:13.624 --> 36:18.464
The girl says
they were moved here, yes?

36:18.464 --> 36:21.704
She says they were moved
a few times over the years.

36:21.704 --> 36:23.824
Basements, cellars...

36:24.824 --> 36:29.744
And then, most recently, here,
for... several months?

36:29.744 --> 36:31.344
As best as she can remember.

36:31.344 --> 36:33.984
It's not like she had any way
of telling the time.

36:33.984 --> 36:39.224
This abductor - he takes Sophie.
The following year, Alice Webster.

36:39.224 --> 36:43.424
For 11 years he keeps them hidden
from the world, and then...

36:44.424 --> 36:47.224
..takes them to this place
in the middle of a forest.

36:48.504 --> 36:49.784
Why?

36:49.784 --> 36:52.104
We'll find out
when we catch the bastard.

37:06.704 --> 37:09.664
We should turn back. Julien. Julien!

37:09.664 --> 37:12.571
Julien. Julien, we can turn back!

37:13.464 --> 37:15.264
Julien! Julien!

37:17.704 --> 37:21.584
We are looking for someone.
We are not seeking trouble.

37:24.864 --> 37:26.704
English? You speak English?

37:26.704 --> 37:29.464
The jihadists are gone.
Isil has fled for now.

37:29.464 --> 37:31.744
The Peshmerga came
and drove them out.

37:31.744 --> 37:33.624
Who is it you are looking for?

37:36.624 --> 37:38.104
His name is Daniel Reed.

37:38.104 --> 37:41.624
The information I have says
he was here a month or so ago.

37:41.624 --> 37:43.424
I do not recognise him.

37:44.258 --> 37:45.824
But perhaps someone else will.

37:46.492 --> 37:47.224
Follow me.

37:47.224 --> 37:50.584
I will show this photo around.
Isil did not scare us all away.

37:50.584 --> 37:52.024
Thank you.

37:52.024 --> 37:55.599
Because of the surface area
of the burns,

37:55.624 --> 37:59.824
I would suggest
a split thickness skin graft.

37:59.824 --> 38:04.795
It allows us to cover larger areas.

38:05.584 --> 38:09.424
And because the same site
can be harvested after six weeks,

38:09.424 --> 38:12.504
it's possible to do
the surgery in stages.

38:12.504 --> 38:14.464
How much is it?

38:14.464 --> 38:17.424
Because of your situation,
Mr Webster,

38:17.424 --> 38:19.464
I would do the work for free.

38:19.464 --> 38:23.224
The scarring would be
minimal at first.

38:23.224 --> 38:26.264
And, then, in time,
you will not even be able to see it.

38:29.464 --> 38:31.064
Back to the old me, then, eh?

38:47.744 --> 38:49.744
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.744
What did the plastic surgeon say?

38:51.744 --> 38:53.984
- Yeah, he said he can do it.
- Oh, great.

38:53.984 --> 38:57.104
But we can't afford it.
I looked into it.

38:57.104 --> 38:59.224
Just scars. I'll live with it.

39:04.344 --> 39:06.344
Matthew!

39:06.344 --> 39:08.302
Matthew, I want to talk to you.

39:09.704 --> 39:11.356
Matthew!

39:15.624 --> 39:17.464
Well, no change there, then.

39:17.464 --> 39:19.544
- Can't you talk to him?
- Me?

39:20.744 --> 39:22.344
We can't just stop trying, Sam.

39:22.344 --> 39:24.584
I haven't stopped trying.
He just doesn't care, does he?

39:24.584 --> 39:26.158
I nearly lost my job because of him.

39:26.183 --> 39:29.063
Now I'm stuck pushing papers around.
And for what?

39:29.344 --> 39:30.784
So he can still hate me.

39:35.504 --> 39:37.424
I'm going to go and work on the car.

39:37.424 --> 39:39.184
You'll never get it going again.

39:39.184 --> 39:40.664
Or is that the point?

39:41.784 --> 39:43.904
Oh,
don't get oil on your shirt again.

40:59.344 --> 41:00.944
So, what do you think, then?

41:03.424 --> 41:05.984
We should get back. We'll be late.

41:05.984 --> 41:09.464
Dad, you need to look around.
See if you like the place.

41:09.464 --> 41:12.231
I... I've seen it. Now let's go home.

41:12.256 --> 41:13.473
Dad, you're not even looking.

41:13.498 --> 41:15.777
I know where I am,
for Christ's sake.

41:16.344 --> 41:17.906
I know what we're doing.

41:20.224 --> 41:23.424
This is a place where
you'll be looked after, Dad.

41:23.424 --> 41:26.224
They'll be able to help you
much better than I can.

41:30.864 --> 41:33.064
These people gave their lives
for their country

41:33.064 --> 41:34.824
and this is how we repay them?

41:34.824 --> 41:38.544
Scrabble sets with half the pieces
missing and a shared toilet?

41:38.544 --> 41:42.344
This is what passes for the state taking
care of those who took care of them?

41:42.344 --> 41:46.224
Stopped them talking bloody Arabic?
It's not good enough!

41:46.224 --> 41:48.855
Dad, this isn't a military hospital.
This is a place where...

41:48.880 --> 41:53.024
Henry knows what I'm talking about.
Good old Henry Reed.

41:53.024 --> 41:56.944
He's got his head screwed on.
He'll tell you.

41:58.744 --> 42:00.424
Dad. Come on.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.064
Remarkable, is it not?

42:16.504 --> 42:20.179
In front of all this, people
still go about their business.

42:20.664 --> 42:22.144
They adapt.

42:22.144 --> 42:26.224
I guess it's the only way of taking
control of your life, I suppose.

42:27.264 --> 42:30.424
Feeling like your fate is
in your own hands for a change.

42:32.424 --> 42:33.864
I miss that feeling.

42:35.624 --> 42:37.553
Is there really nothing they can do?

42:37.578 --> 42:38.938
Well, they say...

42:40.904 --> 42:44.384
..if I don't have it operated on,
there is a chance I will die.

42:44.384 --> 42:48.024
But if I have it operated on...

42:49.544 --> 42:52.144
..there is a chance I will die.
So...

42:52.144 --> 42:53.744
You see my problem.

42:54.944 --> 42:58.344
But with all that going on,
why here, now?

42:59.624 --> 43:03.424
Many years ago, I was given a case -
a missing girl. Sophie Giroux.

43:04.904 --> 43:07.224
I made a mistake. The mother died.

43:08.544 --> 43:11.464
The father, Remy Giroux,
lost his entire family

43:11.464 --> 43:16.184
and I carry that guilt with me.

43:16.184 --> 43:17.664
Always.

43:23.344 --> 43:26.424
I once heard someone say
that guilt is like a cancer -

43:26.424 --> 43:30.024
you can treat the symptoms,
but never the cause.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.984
Perhaps that's all I am doing.

43:35.624 --> 43:36.984
Nah.

43:38.146 --> 43:40.266
You're doing it for yourself. Right?

43:41.664 --> 43:43.624
I mean...

43:43.624 --> 43:47.744
Detectives are just a bunch of
nosy bastards with badges, right?

43:49.624 --> 43:52.864
And journalists are the same, non?
Only, no badges...

43:58.624 --> 44:00.104
We must leave.

44:00.104 --> 44:02.184
Wait, what? Right now.

44:13.144 --> 44:16.104
What just happened?
What did you see?

44:17.104 --> 44:19.588
There's something
you're not telling me, isn't there?

44:19.613 --> 44:24.755
I think somebody is following me.
Twice, I have seen the same man -

44:24.780 --> 44:27.060
once in Kirkuk,
at the bank, do you remember?

44:27.104 --> 44:29.624
- And now again in the village.
- You're sure?

44:29.624 --> 44:32.544
The same person followed you
from Kirkuk all the way out here?

44:32.544 --> 44:36.264
Well, maybe this explains why our
hosts were so keen to keep us there.

44:36.264 --> 44:38.864
Maybe they know exactly
where Daniel Reed is.

44:38.864 --> 44:41.784
Julien, you need to be honest
with me. Why are you being followed?

44:41.784 --> 44:44.744
And what's all this got to do with
Alice Webster and Sophie Giroux?

44:46.144 --> 44:47.824
Look, look!

45:10.504 --> 45:11.624
What's happening?

45:11.624 --> 45:13.624
It's fine, they're Peshmerga.

45:25.464 --> 45:26.664
What is he saying?

45:26.664 --> 45:29.144
He wants to know
how you know that man.

45:42.464 --> 45:44.024
What is going on?

45:44.024 --> 45:45.184
I have no idea.

45:46.664 --> 45:48.944
But that photo
means something to them.

45:51.584 --> 45:53.544
What?

45:54.784 --> 45:56.264
Whoa, whoa!

47:21.184 --> 47:22.224
Hey.

47:40.224 --> 47:42.239
Do you remember this?

47:43.144 --> 47:46.664
Yeah.
We had the biggest fight over that.

47:48.264 --> 47:50.224
Here you go, Midget.

47:51.424 --> 47:52.544
Mine at last.

47:55.744 --> 47:58.184
I want to ask you something.

47:58.184 --> 47:59.224
I want you to...

48:01.184 --> 48:03.304
I want you to do something for me.

48:04.944 --> 48:05.984
OK.

48:07.184 --> 48:08.664
I can't sleep.

48:09.904 --> 48:13.824
I just feel like
anyone could get in.

48:13.824 --> 48:16.024
No-one's going to hurt you now,
Alice.

48:22.904 --> 48:24.704
What's in the shed?

48:24.704 --> 48:26.344
I don't know. Nothing much.

48:27.744 --> 48:30.119
I want to sleep in the shed.

48:31.184 --> 48:34.424
The floors here, they're...
They're too soft.

48:34.424 --> 48:35.664
It's cold out there.

48:39.784 --> 48:42.904
I want to sleep in the shed.

48:42.904 --> 48:45.664
And I need you...

48:45.664 --> 48:46.904
to lock me in.

48:49.824 --> 48:51.304
Is that what he did to you?

48:52.464 --> 48:55.224
I haven't slept since I got here.

49:01.064 --> 49:02.624
No, not like that.

49:02.624 --> 49:04.744
I'm not locking you in
like an animal.

49:04.744 --> 49:07.944
I'm asking you to help me.

49:09.824 --> 49:11.464
It's what I want.

49:13.904 --> 49:14.944
Please.

49:25.064 --> 49:28.744
I'll come and get you
in the morning. First thing.

49:28.744 --> 49:29.984
Thanks, Midget.

50:36.664 --> 50:37.904
Hello.

50:37.904 --> 50:41.184
'Sergeant, it's Jorn.
I'm sorry for calling so early.'

50:41.184 --> 50:43.744
But we've been combing through
everything the search parties

50:43.744 --> 50:46.584
found at the bunker
and I think we have something.

50:46.584 --> 50:49.944
Or rather Detective Baptiste
found something.

50:49.944 --> 50:52.064
A receipt,
dated from a week ago.

50:52.064 --> 50:54.144
'There was no other human debris
down there.

50:54.144 --> 50:56.784
'And, as far as we know, no persons
were aware of these tunnels.'

50:56.784 --> 50:58.304
Where's it from?

50:58.304 --> 51:00.424
'A clothes store here in Eckhausen.'

51:00.424 --> 51:03.024
The receipt shows only
the last few digits of the card,

51:03.024 --> 51:05.624
but we've called them,
and we have a name.

51:44.264 --> 51:45.704
Kristian?! Argh!

51:48.304 --> 51:49.544
Argh!

51:53.184 --> 51:54.944
What the hell's going on, Sergeant?

51:54.944 --> 51:56.344
We need to question your husband

51:56.344 --> 51:58.504
about the abduction
of two little girls.

52:13.904 --> 52:15.064
I'm sorry.

52:16.384 --> 52:19.224
Please don't... Don't blame Matthew.
I-I begged him to do it.

52:19.224 --> 52:21.184
Ssh-ssh. Hey, hey, hey.

52:21.184 --> 52:22.464
It's all right.

52:22.464 --> 52:24.544
I don't like the light coming
in to wake me up... Ssh.

52:24.544 --> 52:27.624
- ..it burns my eyes.
- It'll get better.

52:27.624 --> 52:29.264
I promise you, it'll get better.

52:29.264 --> 52:31.664
You should come inside.
It's freezing.

52:31.664 --> 52:33.344
And...

52:33.344 --> 52:34.864
Well, something's happened.

52:34.864 --> 52:36.144
There's been an arrest.

52:36.144 --> 52:38.384
And the army police,
they want you to identify him.

52:38.384 --> 52:40.464
You know, the man that took you.

52:40.464 --> 52:42.024
It's just a photograph.

52:42.024 --> 52:45.624
All you have to do is look at
a photograph and say if it's him.

52:45.624 --> 52:47.064
Can you do that, my love?

52:53.744 --> 52:55.224
Good girl.

53:21.824 --> 53:23.744
Alice.

53:23.744 --> 53:26.584
I'm going to show you some pictures,
and I need you to tell me

53:26.584 --> 53:29.624
if you recognise
any of the men in these photos.

54:28.064 --> 54:30.464
That's him. Must be.

54:30.464 --> 54:32.384
The way she looked at it -
this is him, isn't it?

54:32.384 --> 54:34.464
We need a positive identification.

54:38.024 --> 54:39.704
Let me try talking to her.

54:40.944 --> 54:42.944
It might be less overwhelming.

55:02.584 --> 55:04.144
Do you mind?

55:15.464 --> 55:18.237
So, the man in the photo.

55:19.144 --> 55:20.384
Yes, that's him.

55:28.184 --> 55:30.024
Must be something, all this.

55:31.784 --> 55:33.944
Like being able to see again.

55:33.944 --> 55:36.464
I can see just fine.

55:36.464 --> 55:37.704
I always have.

55:44.344 --> 55:47.604
Do you ever hear that fable
about the turtle?

55:49.064 --> 55:52.384
He lived in a tiny pond
at the foot of a mountain,

55:52.384 --> 55:54.984
swimming in circles
and playing with frogs.

55:56.744 --> 56:02.064
The thing he loved most was when his
friends, the birds, came to visit.

56:02.064 --> 56:04.904
They'd tell him
about their adventures,

56:04.904 --> 56:09.283
up snowy mountain peaks,
lush green valleys.

56:10.584 --> 56:12.664
He desperately wanted
to go with them.

56:12.664 --> 56:15.824
But he couldn't - they said -
he didn't have any wings.

56:15.824 --> 56:17.704
He replied...

56:18.864 --> 56:20.464
.. "You could be my wings."

56:22.704 --> 56:25.144
And the birds
came up with this idea.

56:25.144 --> 56:27.584
They got hold of a long stick -

56:27.584 --> 56:31.304
they clasped either end of it
in their claws.

56:31.304 --> 56:34.224
The turtle would be
in the middle of them,

56:34.224 --> 56:37.224
and he'd clench his jaw
around the stick.

56:38.984 --> 56:41.704
Then they'd be able
to take him up into the sky.

56:44.024 --> 56:46.104
Up he went, higher and higher.

56:47.384 --> 56:49.184
And when he looked down and saw

56:49.184 --> 56:51.504
the tiny place
he used to call his home...

56:53.144 --> 56:54.664
..he said, "Wow."

56:56.864 --> 56:58.224
Opening his mouth.

56:59.464 --> 57:01.384
And he fell back down to earth,

57:01.384 --> 57:03.864
cracking his shell
into a million pieces.

57:06.864 --> 57:08.464
I've heard that story.

57:10.944 --> 57:13.624
I thought he fell into the ocean.

57:13.624 --> 57:15.584
That's the fairy-tale version.

57:15.584 --> 57:16.904
The one for children.

57:18.824 --> 57:20.704
And you're not a child any more.

57:23.424 --> 57:24.784
Are you?

57:27.664 --> 57:30.941
You don't want to end up like that,
Alice.

57:33.064 --> 57:34.424
Hold on to that stick.

57:39.784 --> 57:41.584
How can you live with yourself...

57:43.744 --> 57:45.264
..after what you've done?

57:58.424 --> 58:00.064
Don't stay out here too long.

58:01.586 --> 58:02.626
It's cold.
