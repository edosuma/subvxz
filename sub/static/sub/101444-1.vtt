WEBVTT

02:37.042 --> 02:38.417
Oi!

02:38.583 --> 02:40.667
You cheeky little bastard!

02:40.833 --> 02:42.417
It's mine.

02:56.208 --> 02:58.083
You never take this off?

02:59.125 --> 03:01.792
My dad gave it to me
for my communion.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.917
Not even when you're in the shower?

03:07.083 --> 03:08.292
Nope.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.208
Never.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.125
What did you think
when you first saw me?

03:25.167 --> 03:27.125
I thought you were fucking hot.

03:35.125 --> 03:36.792
But Mike was there.

03:38.708 --> 03:41.125
You didn't care
that I was with someone?

03:42.167 --> 03:46.958
I had a feeling that you wouldn't
really mind you were with someone.

03:52.625 --> 03:54.125
What?

03:56.875 --> 03:58.250
What?

04:00.500 --> 04:01.792
Suz...

04:03.000 --> 04:04.250
What's up with ya?

04:04.417 --> 04:06.542
It's been months since I left Mike.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.667
Yeah, and we've been
seeing each other and that.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.792
Seeing each other?

04:17.875 --> 04:19.958
We only ever meet here.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.041
You've never even been to mine.

04:22.917 --> 04:27.000
How long have you lived here?
There's no picture on the wall.

04:28.125 --> 04:30.333
Come on, things are nice with us.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.875
Nice?

04:33.875 --> 04:36.625
Yeah, it's really nice as it is.

04:39.292 --> 04:41.708
It could be so much better than this.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.458
Is this really enough?

04:58.458 --> 05:01.375
I'll get the rest of me bits
when I have the car.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.375
And my lamp.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.125
Fine.

05:12.875 --> 05:17.042
Fine, fine, fine...

05:22.625 --> 05:26.000
"Yeah, it's really nice as it is."
Fucking bellend!

05:26.167 --> 05:27.833
"Really nice as it is."

06:00.167 --> 06:01.458
I've nearly done it all.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.292
Oh, it's about time.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.542
Took you ages.

06:06.792 --> 06:08.583
Well, you'll miss me.

06:09.292 --> 06:10.708
Says who?

06:12.125 --> 06:14.250
Sure I'll see you later.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.042
After your shift.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.833
I've got a boyfriend.

06:23.958 --> 06:25.583
He can get involved if he wants.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.917
Yeah? I'll ask him.

06:29.625 --> 06:31.125
Hey, Jade.

06:31.542 --> 06:32.833
Hey.

06:33.292 --> 06:36.083
- Do you wanna hang out this weekend?
- I'm working, love.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.625
Oh, of course.

06:37.792 --> 06:39.375
I'll see you later, love.

06:39.542 --> 06:40.708
Yeah.

06:42.167 --> 06:44.125
What were we saying?

06:47.958 --> 06:51.000
Well, that's nice.
Just turn your back to me, then.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.125
Pete.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.042
Pete.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.375
Have you gone off me now?

07:15.875 --> 07:18.417
All right, girls, that's it.
Let's come in.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.542
- What you up to tonight?
- Have a party.

07:25.708 --> 07:26.667
You?

07:26.833 --> 07:29.875
- Going out with some school friends.
- Oh, nice.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.250
I need to tell you something.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.708
Let me tell you something.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.458
I need to tell you.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.208
I need to tell you.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.000
Come back, Laurie!

08:50.375 --> 08:52.167
That's it, very nice, come on.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.292
Were you watching me?

09:31.542 --> 09:35.833
I work here,
just doing bits and bites.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.625
Doesn't look like you're working.

09:39.958 --> 09:41.667
You normally run
this time of night, do you?

09:41.833 --> 09:43.667
You would know, wouldn't you?

09:43.833 --> 09:46.292
Hey, hang about. Do you want a fag?

09:50.208 --> 09:51.875
Could offer you a lift home
if you want.

09:52.042 --> 09:54.000
Oh, really? Thanks.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.792
Gonna help me get on the telly,

09:55.958 --> 09:58.958
maybe on "Crimewatch"
washed up in an estuary?

10:14.417 --> 10:17.917
We've been here six months
and we're still unpacking!

10:26.125 --> 10:27.333
Junk.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.625
More junk.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.958
You could help me with this,
you know?

10:45.208 --> 10:46.583
Hello?

10:47.125 --> 10:48.458
What?

10:49.083 --> 10:51.417
You gonna talk to me?

10:59.042 --> 11:02.083
Don't wait for me for dinner,
I have plans.

11:44.833 --> 11:46.375
Did you have fun?

11:59.417 --> 12:01.167
Simone, arms!

12:08.667 --> 12:10.083
I've, uh--

12:10.583 --> 12:12.417
I've done this trial thing.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.792
To be a model.
You know, like for online stuff.

12:15.958 --> 12:16.875
- Trial?
- Yeah.

12:17.042 --> 12:19.958
You just kinda, like,
send a couple pics of yourself.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.375
They make you whip
your knickers off, don't they?

12:23.917 --> 12:27.750
Not exactly,
but you do have to be super sexy.

12:27.917 --> 12:31.708
And if they like it, well,
you get paid a shit ton of money.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.000
You should maybe try it.

12:37.042 --> 12:39.042
Yeah. No.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.750
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

12:52.917 --> 12:54.000
Got P.E.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.125
Such a good girl, aren't you?

12:57.125 --> 12:58.792
I'm taking the piss.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.125
I'll see you later, love.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.083
Now walk for 10 seconds.

13:20.708 --> 13:23.167
Oi, Laurie, Danny's on his way.

13:24.167 --> 13:27.167
You know Danny, don't you?
Track champion.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.958
Is this why you're training
with the track team?

13:30.125 --> 13:31.917
No other track
in this shithole, is there?

13:32.083 --> 13:34.875
- What? Dublin is fucking London?
- Yeah. Compared to here.

13:35.042 --> 13:38.208
- Why don't you go back, then?
- Maybe I will.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.542
Hey, gorgeous.

13:40.708 --> 13:43.583
Oh, my God. Ms. A is gonna have
a fit if she sees you.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.042
- We're going to town tonight.
- 30 seconds left!

13:46.208 --> 13:47.542
We're heading down to YUX.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.958
No, I can't--I can't.
It's Angel's 17th, innit?

13:50.125 --> 13:51.417
Oh, come on.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.708
No, no. Laurie's getting jealous.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.958
We was together the other night
when you were calling.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.750
And run!

14:02.125 --> 14:05.125
Danny! Back to school, now!

14:11.792 --> 14:13.333
Keep moving.

14:21.708 --> 14:24.500
One more, ladies! Let's go.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.875
Look at Laurie.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.792
You're a creepy fuck.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.417
You've got balls.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.375
Look, Laurie's trying
to get herself a boyfriend.

14:58.542 --> 15:01.292
You're still trying
to get me in your car?

15:01.458 --> 15:02.292
I could have...

15:02.667 --> 15:04.750
moved straight
to the blow to the head.

15:04.917 --> 15:07.458
Stick you in a barrel
of hydrochloric acid.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.542
- What's your name?
- Pete. What's yours?

15:13.708 --> 15:15.375
Like Peter Sutcliffe?

15:15.542 --> 15:17.167
Well, yeah. I was named after him.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.583
My name is Rose West.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.250
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Yeah. Of course, yeah.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.792
Laurie! Back to the class!

15:37.542 --> 15:39.083
We could go out
for an ice cream somewhere.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.083
What, am I 12?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.792
11 PM at the arcade.

15:44.208 --> 15:45.542
Bring the car, yeah?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.542
And the acid.

15:49.208 --> 15:50.750
Yeah, bangin'!

16:06.917 --> 16:09.208
Are you sure
this is the way to the YUX?

16:09.375 --> 16:11.083
Yeah, of course, I am.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.333
Laurie.

16:18.292 --> 16:20.083
How did you know my name?

16:20.250 --> 16:22.917
I saw it on your rucksack, didn't I?

16:23.083 --> 16:24.417
Oh, yeah?

16:25.667 --> 16:29.375
Only a sensible girl would put
her own name on her rucksack.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.542
Your mum sew that one on
for you, did she?

17:20.458 --> 17:23.041
Normally get in cars
with strangers do ya?

17:23.208 --> 17:26.291
Do you normally invite
strangers into your car?

17:27.583 --> 17:29.500
You're the first one.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.333
- Hi, a VK Blue, please?
- Yeah. Of course.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.167
- What the fuck is that?
- Everybody drinks them.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.208
Fuck that. We'll have
two whiskies, please, neat.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.083
Yeah. Yeah. Coming right up.

18:08.708 --> 18:09.875
Thank you.

18:18.042 --> 18:21.375
- How many rooms are there?
- There's three floors here.

18:21.958 --> 18:24.292
- Two more, please.
- Yeah, sure.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.958
- I'll get two more, please.
- Yeah. Sure.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.083
This must be how you reel them in.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.542
How the fuck else
would I reel them in?

18:40.875 --> 18:42.458
So what's your job?

18:42.625 --> 18:44.417
Or do you even have a job?

18:47.042 --> 18:50.042
Take over people's homes,
make 'em mine for a bit.

18:52.750 --> 18:53.875
You're a squatter.

18:54.042 --> 18:55.208
If you want, yeah.

18:55.583 --> 18:56.708
Me too.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.667
I grew up in the streets.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.208
Bollocks.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.708
- I know your type.
- Oh, yeah? What's that then?

19:04.875 --> 19:07.333
You're mummy's little princess,
aren't ya?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.292
Back in a sec.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.000
- Could I have another one?
- No worries.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.125
- Bangin' top.
- Thanks.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.833
Come on.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.583
Get up!

20:47.750 --> 20:49.875
Why are you making me go home?

20:50.042 --> 20:53.417
- Can't be doing babysitting, now.
- It's not even 2:00 AM.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.542
I'm gonna make my own way home.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.292
Get up.

20:59.542 --> 21:01.250
- Now!
- No.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.042
Get up now!

21:06.292 --> 21:07.500
Fuck.

21:08.833 --> 21:09.667
Little Laurie...

21:10.750 --> 21:12.333
Trying to make me jealous
with this guy?

21:12.500 --> 21:14.708
- Fuckin' hell.
- This is my husband.

21:15.292 --> 21:16.583
Say hello.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.000
Some things in life
only a man can give you.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.333
Was he the last one left?

21:22.500 --> 21:24.042
Nobody likes you.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.208
Tramp.

21:33.667 --> 21:37.417
- Best apologize, boy.
- Hey, it's just banter.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.958
Hey, we're all right,
aren't we, Laurie?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.250
See?

21:44.292 --> 21:45.333
Dickhead.

21:52.042 --> 21:53.292
Thank you.

21:56.125 --> 21:59.000
Oh, Jesus. Fucking what?

23:56.542 --> 23:58.042
Laurie.

23:59.167 --> 24:00.500
Oh, hi.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.208
I've lost the whale.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.625
Where is the whale?

24:05.292 --> 24:06.417
Fuck it.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.208
That hurt.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.750
I'm in pain!

24:21.125 --> 24:23.917
Oh, no way. I need a timeout.

24:24.083 --> 24:26.000
Timeout.

24:27.792 --> 24:30.042
All right. Abandon ship.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.792
What are you doing?

24:33.208 --> 24:35.875
That was the coolest shit
I've ever seen.

24:46.375 --> 24:48.375
- You can have that.
- I don't want to eat that.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.167
I do not want to eat that.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.792
- What are you doing?
- Take this.

25:07.958 --> 25:10.000
- I don't need that.
- It's okay. It's fine.

25:10.167 --> 25:12.167
- I don't need that.
- Fuck off.

25:13.208 --> 25:14.417
Here.

25:15.458 --> 25:16.625
Thanks.

25:19.625 --> 25:20.792
How do I look?

25:22.708 --> 25:25.292
You look like
the best thing I've ever seen.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.167
What's this?

25:31.333 --> 25:32.458
Oh, fucking bollocks.

25:32.625 --> 25:35.667
Peter Rayne. Painter/decorator.

25:35.833 --> 25:38.000
Two mysteries solved in one go.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.417
Yeah. Busted. Case cracked.
Nice one, Sherlock.

25:41.833 --> 25:42.833
Yeah.

25:44.708 --> 25:47.083
You've really don't look like
a painter/decorator.

25:47.250 --> 25:49.167
- What?
- Like, you'd be like a--

25:49.625 --> 25:51.458
like a guitarist or something.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.875
- Fucking guitarist?
- Yeah.

25:54.042 --> 25:55.458
Or just some weirdo.

25:55.833 --> 25:56.958
Yeah.

26:01.667 --> 26:03.042
Where do you live?

26:03.208 --> 26:04.500
Nowhere suitable for a posh life.

26:04.667 --> 26:07.625
I am not posh. I can burp the
alphabet in like 30 languages.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:09.667 --> 26:12.375
We'll have a conversation when
you can fart the National Anthem.

26:12.542 --> 26:13.625
- Deal.
- How about that?

26:13.792 --> 26:15.083
Done.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh, shit.

26:22.542 --> 26:23.792
I think I have to go.

26:23.958 --> 26:26.083
- Mummy calling you, is she?
- No.

26:29.125 --> 26:30.167
Wait.

26:31.875 --> 26:33.000
What?

26:38.125 --> 26:39.292
For you.

26:51.708 --> 26:52.875
Thank you.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.958
Look after my jacket.

28:08.167 --> 28:09.208
How are you getting on?

28:09.542 --> 28:13.000
Yeah, bangin'. Just finished
prepping and I'll get started.

28:13.167 --> 28:14.208
All right.

28:14.375 --> 28:17.708
And you'll be back next week
to do the upstairs room.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.833
- And the week after as well.
- Very good.

28:21.875 --> 28:23.417
We'll leave you to it.

28:35.792 --> 28:37.875
What have I said to you last time?

28:38.042 --> 28:40.667
What have I--fucking bastard!

28:44.708 --> 28:47.042
Should I tell your dad
about what you been doing?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.375
You don't know my dad.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.458
I know he'll come running

28:49.625 --> 28:51.875
when I nail your backside
to that lamppost, right?

28:52.542 --> 28:54.667
Hey, you Laurie. Fuck off.

28:57.542 --> 28:58.750
I, uh--

28:59.875 --> 29:02.083
Why were you hurting that child?

29:02.250 --> 29:04.125
Uh, he looked at me funny.

29:06.708 --> 29:08.750
Here. I kept your jacket safe.

29:08.917 --> 29:09.875
Thank you.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.792
So this is where you live.

29:13.417 --> 29:14.250
Cool.

29:14.417 --> 29:17.125
I thought you'd live
in like a cave or something.

29:17.292 --> 29:18.292
Not bad.

29:18.458 --> 29:21.375
You don't have to say that.
Let's fuck off, come on.

29:21.542 --> 29:22.708
Where are we going?

29:23.417 --> 29:26.250
Oh, fuck. Hang on.
I need to lock the door.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.458
Little bastard'll nick
my fucking paints again.

29:28.625 --> 29:30.458
Stay there. I'll be right back.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.917
When I was a kid, my mum used to say
"Look over there"

29:50.083 --> 29:52.292
and she told me it was Las Vegas.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.542
Did you believe her?

29:57.417 --> 29:58.875
Yeah. Of course.

30:03.958 --> 30:05.292
Have you ever been?

30:08.792 --> 30:10.417
Never left the UK, me.

30:14.250 --> 30:16.292
Mum's got family in Rotterdam.

30:18.708 --> 30:21.750
You know, always telling me
to come visit and that.

30:24.042 --> 30:25.833
Learnt a bit of Dutch as well.

30:29.208 --> 30:30.458
Tot ziens.

30:32.958 --> 30:34.375
What's that?

30:36.833 --> 30:37.875
"Goodbye".

30:40.750 --> 30:42.542
So why haven't you been?

30:46.167 --> 30:48.542
Maybe I was waiting to meet you.

30:49.917 --> 30:51.208
Fuck off.

31:03.583 --> 31:04.917
Where are you taking me?

31:05.083 --> 31:07.042
Hang on. Hang about, you'll see.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.125
Bear with me a little bit, though.

31:11.083 --> 31:12.875
Because it's been a while.

31:15.333 --> 31:17.333
What are you talking about?

31:17.500 --> 31:20.667
When I was a bit younger, right?
Used to come down here

31:21.167 --> 31:22.458
A while ago, but...

31:24.542 --> 31:26.792
Trust me for a minute.

31:33.667 --> 31:34.958
Did that.

31:35.125 --> 31:36.083
Really?

31:41.625 --> 31:43.000
That's cool.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.875
Well, it's all right.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.292
Could you teach me?

31:53.167 --> 31:56.542
Doubt it. I mean,
it was fucking ages ago now.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.500
Ages ago?

32:01.208 --> 32:02.583
How old are you?

32:04.500 --> 32:05.750
Thirty-three.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.583
Thirty-three?

32:09.417 --> 32:10.417
Like Jesus.

32:13.458 --> 32:14.542
Better than Jesus.

32:15.708 --> 32:17.417
Oh, was he 33, was he?

32:27.375 --> 32:29.375
The other day I was painting

32:29.542 --> 32:32.042
the living room
in someone's house, right?

32:32.375 --> 32:35.417
I'm on all fours, like,
mixing the paint, you know.

32:36.167 --> 32:38.542
Cutting into the skirting boards

32:39.375 --> 32:43.000
and I look up
and I see my signature in the corner,

32:43.167 --> 32:44.375
from ages ago.

32:45.958 --> 32:50.292
Because I put my initials somewhere
hidden on the wall after I paint it.

32:52.417 --> 32:55.708
And I didn't realize
but I was back in the same house,

32:57.208 --> 33:00.625
painting the same--same walls.

33:07.042 --> 33:09.833
Everyone gets on with their life
They just...

33:13.292 --> 33:15.375
...get married, have kids.

33:16.917 --> 33:18.000
Travel.

33:28.583 --> 33:29.792
Everyone who?

33:35.292 --> 33:36.333
Laurie.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.667
Yeah?

33:49.750 --> 33:51.167
You look like your mum.

33:54.750 --> 33:56.208
How would you know?

33:56.875 --> 34:00.333
I saw her picking you up
at the track, didn't I?

34:03.625 --> 34:06.167
Well, like,
maybe when she was younger.

34:07.083 --> 34:08.750
She's all old and...

34:08.917 --> 34:10.750
stressed out and shit.

34:12.500 --> 34:13.667
Why?

34:15.792 --> 34:17.792
Because her boyfriend left her.

34:19.667 --> 34:21.167
And my Nan died...

34:21.333 --> 34:24.542
like, kinda simultaneously.

34:26.667 --> 34:28.250
Sorry about your Nan.

34:29.042 --> 34:30.542
I barely knew her.

34:32.167 --> 34:36.583
She had a chip on her shoulder
that Mum went to raise me so far away

34:36.750 --> 34:38.375
and live in Dublin and...

34:47.667 --> 34:49.375
What about your dad?

34:50.042 --> 34:52.000
- My dad?
- Yeah.

34:52.917 --> 34:56.500
Just some random guy who
didn't want anything to do with me.

34:59.250 --> 35:01.375
Your mum told you that, didn't she?

35:02.542 --> 35:03.542
Sort of.

35:07.708 --> 35:09.958
Maybe she wasn't telling the truth.

35:11.333 --> 35:13.417
He's never been in touch, so...

35:13.583 --> 35:15.833
Maybe he didn't know how to do it.

35:16.000 --> 35:22.125
Yeah. In 2018 with Facebook, Google,
and everything, he didn't know how.

35:24.333 --> 35:25.375
Nah.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.292
Would you want to know him?

35:33.708 --> 35:35.417
I don't care about him.

35:36.167 --> 35:39.542
He's just like some loser
who knocked up my mum and ran.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.583
Mark's the one I miss, though.

35:49.542 --> 35:51.000
He was the best.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.292
Mum's boyfriend, is it?

36:01.375 --> 36:02.333
Ex-boyfriend.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.583
Ex-boyfriend.

36:05.208 --> 36:06.250
Yeah.

36:18.292 --> 36:19.625
Are you okay?

36:22.917 --> 36:25.375
I should get you home, really,
shouldn't I?

36:29.667 --> 36:31.208
Can we go to yours first?

36:32.708 --> 36:35.875
I feel kinda sick. I think
I need to eat something.

37:04.667 --> 37:06.250
Is the heating on?

37:06.417 --> 37:07.583
Yeah.

37:54.708 --> 37:55.750
Here.

38:19.083 --> 38:21.208
- Eat something.
- I'm not hungry.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.333
What?

38:27.500 --> 38:28.625
Nothing.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.000
Come back.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.875
Do it or I won't give you
what you want.

38:53.250 --> 38:54.750
I don't want anything.

38:57.542 --> 38:58.583
Pete?

39:04.917 --> 39:06.333
Who's this?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.417
His cousin.

39:08.583 --> 39:10.958
- Got me from the cousin shop.
- Shut it.

39:11.708 --> 39:12.958
Do you want some food?
You look hungry.

39:13.125 --> 39:14.708
Just came for some things.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.583
It's not what you think.
She's a friend of a friend.

39:16.750 --> 39:19.542
- I'm not a friend.
- Fuck's sake, Pete.

39:20.167 --> 39:22.250
Meet tomorrow
and I'll explain, all right?

39:22.417 --> 39:24.208
Explain this? Seriously.

39:24.375 --> 39:25.708
Where's my lipstick?

39:27.583 --> 39:28.667
Laurie?

39:31.208 --> 39:32.333
I've not seen it. I don't know.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.417
You really are a bastard.

39:39.833 --> 39:40.875
Suz.

39:57.583 --> 39:58.792
Get your bits.

39:58.958 --> 40:00.042
We're going.

40:53.458 --> 40:56.708
I'm sorry if I got
a bit out of order.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.042
I thought maybe I was a bit...

41:02.667 --> 41:04.042
It's not your fault.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.042
So...

41:10.125 --> 41:11.625
is that your girlfriend?

41:23.708 --> 41:24.792
Pete.

41:31.250 --> 41:34.375
You think you're too old for me,
is that what it is?

41:36.625 --> 41:39.500
Can't go around telling people
we're together.

41:46.333 --> 41:47.417
Hang on.

41:47.583 --> 41:48.667
Hang about.

41:56.708 --> 41:57.542
Laurie!

41:58.333 --> 41:59.625
Laurie...

41:59.792 --> 42:01.333
I never meant it like that.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.917
- What are you doing?
- I'm walking home.

42:03.083 --> 42:04.292
- Where you off?
- I'm walking home.

42:04.458 --> 42:05.583
Well, it's fucking freezing.
Let me give you a lift.

42:05.750 --> 42:07.417
You're a creep,
Will you just fucking--

42:07.583 --> 42:08.542
I don't fucking need you.

42:08.708 --> 42:09.625
It's freezing.

42:09.792 --> 42:10.792
Fuck off.

42:15.167 --> 42:16.208
Laurie!

42:27.333 --> 42:29.208
Where have you been?
It's a school night.

42:29.375 --> 42:32.500
- None of your business.
- I'm sick of this attitude.

42:33.375 --> 42:34.500
Laurie!

43:17.958 --> 43:19.750
Oh, that's nice.

43:39.458 --> 43:40.708
Pete?

43:43.208 --> 43:44.750
Pete, what's wrong?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.042
What's wrong?

43:52.458 --> 43:54.000
What's the problem, Pete?

43:54.708 --> 43:55.917
What--

43:56.542 --> 43:57.375
Pete.

43:57.542 --> 43:59.042
Jeez. Pete, stop!

44:00.167 --> 44:01.208
Pete!

44:05.708 --> 44:07.417
Jeez. Fuck this.

44:57.708 --> 44:58.958
Hiya.

44:59.125 --> 45:00.042
Hi.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.292
You like it?

45:12.875 --> 45:15.083
Could you make it
just like me old room

45:15.250 --> 45:16.708
in Mum's house?

45:17.583 --> 45:18.792
What's that like?

45:19.583 --> 45:21.833
It had stars in the ceiling

45:22.000 --> 45:23.375
and all me toys.

45:31.625 --> 45:35.208
Your mama and dad can do
those things. I'm just the painter.

45:35.917 --> 45:37.000
But...

45:38.333 --> 45:39.750
they're gone.

45:40.167 --> 45:43.167
Well, your nana or granddad
can deal with them, then.

46:00.125 --> 46:02.667
All men seem to fall
in love with me, Laurie.

46:02.833 --> 46:04.708
That's the bane of my life.

46:06.042 --> 46:07.958
And this is how you get them.

46:11.125 --> 46:12.583
Wanna do a couple more?

46:13.000 --> 46:14.500
Yeah. Maybe one or two.

46:19.875 --> 46:21.458
Can you take some of me?

46:21.875 --> 46:23.458
That's the spirit.

46:37.542 --> 46:38.708
Oh, for fuck's sake.

46:38.875 --> 46:41.167
- Can I just borrow you for a minute?
- What are you doing here?

46:41.333 --> 46:42.167
You invited me.

46:42.333 --> 46:43.875
Ages ago
and you said you weren't coming.

46:44.042 --> 46:45.958
You're not answering your phone.

46:46.125 --> 46:47.125
Just fuck off.

46:50.625 --> 46:51.875
Oh, fucking hell.

47:08.167 --> 47:09.083
Sorry.

47:09.875 --> 47:10.958
Mr. Jenkins.

47:14.708 --> 47:15.667
Hello.

47:16.458 --> 47:18.042
Bangin' costume.

47:18.542 --> 47:20.292
I'm the party Santa Claus.

47:20.458 --> 47:21.542
Got that, yeah.

47:24.625 --> 47:27.292
You did a great job in that old room.

47:27.458 --> 47:29.708
She loves the purple walls.

47:30.917 --> 47:32.667
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

47:37.917 --> 47:39.083
Right.

47:39.250 --> 47:41.333
Back to the rocker we go.

47:42.167 --> 47:44.250
- Have a good one.
- You bet.

47:55.583 --> 47:56.792
Just leave, will you?

47:56.958 --> 47:58.875
I know what you think you saw
but it's not like that.

47:59.042 --> 48:00.042
I think I saw?

48:00.208 --> 48:01.792
Nothing going on there.

48:02.125 --> 48:04.208
What does "nothing" mean to you?

48:05.167 --> 48:07.417
Is there nothing between us either?

48:08.875 --> 48:10.417
I'm not fucking her.

48:12.375 --> 48:13.875
Fuck sake, Pete.

48:27.667 --> 48:29.583
I have really missed you.

48:31.625 --> 48:33.292
Then stop seeing her.

48:45.458 --> 48:46.542
Can't.

48:47.958 --> 48:49.500
Can't stop seeing her.

50:08.958 --> 50:10.500
I've got you this.

50:22.917 --> 50:23.792
Thank you.

50:23.958 --> 50:27.125
Happy nearly birthday.

50:27.542 --> 50:29.250
- Can you put it on?
- Yeah.

50:32.750 --> 50:35.167
- Did you see the L on it?
- Yeah.

50:44.167 --> 50:46.208
- Do you want me to do it?
- No. Got it.

50:46.375 --> 50:47.542
Bangin'.

50:48.958 --> 50:50.542
I'll never take it off.

50:52.042 --> 50:53.333
Do you forgive me?

50:54.875 --> 50:56.042
What are you doing?

50:58.208 --> 50:59.958
- Shaking your hand.
- Why?

51:00.500 --> 51:03.042
I don't know. Fuck off.
Open the glove box.

51:07.167 --> 51:08.750
Chambrini.

51:09.625 --> 51:12.750
- Special offer, was it?
- Yeah. Everything's special offer.

51:12.917 --> 51:14.292
Let's go. Come on.

51:37.708 --> 51:39.542
- What the fuck is that?
- What do you think it is?

51:39.708 --> 51:42.708
- No. Absolutely not.
- It's my birthday.

51:42.875 --> 51:44.667
- One!
- I'm not doing that.

51:44.833 --> 51:46.667
It's my first time.
I wanna take it with you.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.208
I--You're not doing it.

51:48.375 --> 51:51.375
- You want me to take it alone?
- Laurie, have that. Don't...

51:51.542 --> 51:52.417
Take it alone.

51:56.792 --> 51:58.083
That's so disgusting.

52:04.458 --> 52:05.792
Fucking hell.

52:06.792 --> 52:08.333
How long does it take?

52:08.792 --> 52:10.750
You'll know when it's coming.

52:20.708 --> 52:22.125
You ever have braces?

52:23.167 --> 52:24.667
Two times?

52:29.750 --> 52:32.333
So when did you lose
your first tooth?

52:33.750 --> 52:34.833
Really nice.

52:35.500 --> 52:36.792
Very solid.

52:37.667 --> 52:39.250
I don't remember.

52:40.083 --> 52:41.042
Try.

52:41.208 --> 52:42.542
Try.

52:43.250 --> 52:46.625
I was--I was seven I think.

52:48.083 --> 52:49.917
The tooth fairy took it.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.208
You had chicken pox?

52:55.708 --> 52:57.625
And why do you care?

52:59.042 --> 53:01.542
Well, I want to know
everything about you.

53:03.208 --> 53:05.333
Everything that I missed.

53:12.625 --> 53:15.458
- What?
- Your face is so weird.

53:17.667 --> 53:20.208
You should--you should go away,

53:20.375 --> 53:22.250
and then you should come back

53:22.417 --> 53:25.708
when I've forgot what you look like.

53:28.292 --> 53:30.500
Go away and then--and then--

53:30.667 --> 53:32.083
You should go away.

53:32.667 --> 53:34.125
- This bed ain't big enough.
- No.

53:36.208 --> 53:37.375
Very graceful.

53:50.458 --> 53:51.625
What are you doing?

53:52.625 --> 53:53.667
What?

53:53.833 --> 53:55.333
- Fucking hell.
- Come here.

53:56.250 --> 53:57.208
Oh, wait.

53:57.375 --> 53:59.250
- Please.
- I'm gonna kill you...

53:59.417 --> 54:00.667
- No, no.
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

54:00.833 --> 54:02.083
Please don't.

54:02.875 --> 54:04.875
I have to finish two houses.

54:06.208 --> 54:08.125
No. Please.

54:09.083 --> 54:10.167
Disarmed.

54:11.292 --> 54:12.792
Health and safety.

54:18.542 --> 54:20.625
You're fucking tripping balls.

54:21.667 --> 54:23.167
Look at your eyes.

54:26.333 --> 54:28.042
- Laurie!
- What?

54:28.208 --> 54:29.208
No.

54:30.542 --> 54:31.625
Why not?

54:34.458 --> 54:35.875
Do you not want me?

54:37.708 --> 54:38.875
What?

54:39.042 --> 54:40.458
What's really wrong?

54:50.125 --> 54:52.750
What, Pete?
Are you with that girl or what?

54:52.917 --> 54:53.875
Oh, no.

54:54.250 --> 54:56.667
No, I don't care if you are.

54:56.833 --> 54:58.042
You'll hate me.

54:58.375 --> 55:00.333
You'll--you'll proper hate me.

55:00.500 --> 55:01.417
I'll never hate you.

55:01.583 --> 55:03.292
You'll never wanna see me again.

55:03.458 --> 55:06.208
I promise I'll never hate you.

55:06.875 --> 55:07.917
I promise.

55:10.083 --> 55:12.875
- Promise me you'll never hate me.
- I promise.

55:14.542 --> 55:15.958
Can't we just be--

55:16.125 --> 55:17.333
Let's just be friends.

55:17.500 --> 55:18.708
No.

55:19.083 --> 55:20.875
- I love you, Pete.
- Let's just be friends.

55:21.042 --> 55:23.333
No. I love you.

55:24.500 --> 55:26.542
- We should be friends.
- No.

55:29.458 --> 55:30.708
Get dressed.

55:31.708 --> 55:32.542
No.

55:32.708 --> 55:35.000
- Get dressed.
- No!

55:35.500 --> 55:36.500
Please.

55:36.667 --> 55:39.125
Please get dressed.

55:42.042 --> 55:43.417
Get dressed.

55:43.958 --> 55:45.083
No.

55:47.458 --> 55:48.542
We're--um...

55:51.583 --> 55:52.750
We're...

55:54.792 --> 55:57.542
we're--
we're actually relatives.

56:00.875 --> 56:02.375
We're related.

56:03.750 --> 56:05.042
What do you mean?

56:06.417 --> 56:08.542
We're related. We're...

56:08.708 --> 56:10.208
What do you mean?

56:13.833 --> 56:15.333
I, um...

56:22.542 --> 56:24.000
Banged your mum...

56:25.000 --> 56:26.583
when I was 17.

56:29.125 --> 56:31.833
I'm--I'm...

56:35.708 --> 56:37.417
You fucked my mum?

57:00.917 --> 57:02.667
How are we related?

57:14.750 --> 57:16.417
How are we related?

57:20.583 --> 57:22.333
- How are we--
- I'm your dad.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.708
It's true.

57:44.417 --> 57:46.208
- That's not funny.
- It's true.

57:46.500 --> 57:49.667
Your mum is Jean Kilcline.

57:49.833 --> 57:53.125
Her mum is Norva Kilcline.
Goes by Newman.

57:53.292 --> 57:56.292
She grew up in the fucking same house
you're living in now.

57:58.042 --> 58:00.208
Jean had just broken up with someone.

58:00.375 --> 58:02.333
She was living at home again.
She was older than I was.

58:02.500 --> 58:05.042
Your nana hired me
for a fucking paint job.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.458
That's how we met.

58:19.875 --> 58:22.042
I just wanted to know you.
I was--

58:36.458 --> 58:37.583
Laurie?

58:37.750 --> 58:39.708
I just wanted to know you.

58:42.042 --> 58:43.208
You can't.

58:43.375 --> 58:45.000
- It's 4:00 AM.
- Get away.

58:45.750 --> 58:46.958
You're fucked.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.458
You're fucked.

58:52.542 --> 58:54.125
Have the bed. Stay here.

58:55.542 --> 58:57.958
We can talk about it tomorrow.

58:58.125 --> 59:00.042
That's what we should do.

59:00.208 --> 59:02.208
We should talk about it tomorrow.

59:05.708 --> 59:06.958
Laurie.

59:12.708 --> 59:15.000
- Laurie.
- Fuck off, Pete.

59:33.833 --> 59:36.083
I just wanted to know you.
That's all.

59:36.250 --> 59:37.833
I just wanted to know you.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.708
Mr. Ashelford.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.042
You got a charger?

01:02:14.667 --> 01:02:16.000
For what phone you got?

01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:17.417
Samsung.

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:19.458
Ain't got one for that.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:34.667
Pete?

01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:39.667
Pete?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.125
Oi!

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:41.167
Laurie?

01:06:31.833 --> 01:06:33.750
When you're ready,

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:37.208
I think I need to know
what's been going on with you.

01:06:38.083 --> 01:06:40.208
They had to pump your stomach.

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:56.875
There was a man waiting
outside the house this morning.

01:06:58.333 --> 01:06:59.792
Waiting for you.

01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:05.292
You've been speaking to him?

01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:06.875
You've been seeing him?

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:23.042
Is he really my dad?

01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:34.458
- You're old enough to be his mum.
- That's not true.

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:36.583
I don't care. You're disgusting.

01:07:37.875 --> 01:07:39.583
What's he said to you?

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:51.583
When we met, I knew he was young,

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:53.542
but I didn't know he was that young.

01:07:57.083 --> 01:08:00.000
There are times in life
when people are reckless.

01:08:00.833 --> 01:08:04.125
And I'm glad that I was
because I wouldn't have had you.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:11.542
I wanted to give you
every opportunity in the world.

01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:16.167
And that's why I took you away,

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:18.000
far away from here.

01:08:20.582 --> 01:08:22.167
Away from him?

01:08:25.625 --> 01:08:28.082
Do you think he wanted
to be involved?

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:33.625
Hiya, Jean.

01:11:38.917 --> 01:11:40.500
Looking for Laurie.

01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:44.333
She's been stopping at her mate
Jade's house for the past few weeks.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.292
Thought you'd have known that.

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:49.333
I've not spoke to her.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.792
You've written her a letter?

01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:03.250
Why did you come back here?
You knew I'd meet her eventually.

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:05.125
I thought you would've left.

01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:08.042
That's what you kept saying
back then.

01:12:08.375 --> 01:12:10.000
Guess it was all talk.

01:12:10.167 --> 01:12:11.792
Oh, I'm leaving now.

01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:15.500
Two tickets.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:19.583
I'm gonna ask her
to move away with me.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.292
She hates is around here.

01:12:22.083 --> 01:12:23.667
She's 17.

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:27.917
So was I.

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.000
Pete.

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:42.083
If you want to be a father
then do what's best for her, not you.

01:12:50.167 --> 01:12:51.625
Come on. Faster now.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.583
Very good.

01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:58.042
Oi, knees! Bloody hell.

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:03.292
Very nice. Relax those arms.
Good, good, good.

01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:05.042
Right to the edge.

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:07.250
Straight, straight, straight.
Good.

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:11.500
Arms to nose. Who's next?

01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:12.542
Go on, Anna.

01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:13.958
Very good.

01:13:14.708 --> 01:13:17.750
Very good. Let's go, go, go, go, go.
Come on! Quick!

01:13:19.542 --> 01:13:20.375
Excellent.

01:13:34.417 --> 01:13:36.042
Thanks for coming.

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:38.667
You have five minutes
and then I'm going.

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:43.542
You blocked my number.

01:13:46.208 --> 01:13:47.625
Why aren't you running?

01:13:49.292 --> 01:13:50.583
Are you gonna explain or--

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:52.333
I wanted to tell you.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.625
When?

01:13:56.292 --> 01:13:58.458
I shouldn't have listened to her.
I just didn't want you to hate me.

01:13:58.625 --> 01:13:59.958
Yeah. Well, you did.

01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:01.542
And I do.

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:06.625
All right. You want cod,
haddock, or plaice?

01:14:06.792 --> 01:14:08.208
- Cod.
- Cod.

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:10.375
Anything else?

01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:12.208
- Two beers.
- One beer.

01:14:12.792 --> 01:14:13.958
Okay.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.375
Hey, look at that.

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:24.458
Seagull with one leg.

01:14:24.625 --> 01:14:27.000
There's no such thing as a seagull.
It's a herring gull,

01:14:27.167 --> 01:14:29.833
standing on one leg, like a twat.

01:14:33.792 --> 01:14:36.250
That's a bit harsh
on all the birds what--

01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:39.833
what have lost a leg.

01:14:47.208 --> 01:14:51.208
I'm leaving tomorrow on the ferry.
I'm moving to Rotterdam.

01:14:54.792 --> 01:14:57.625
What do you want me to say?
Congratulations?

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:04.083
- When are your next school holidays?
- I'm quitting school.

01:15:06.708 --> 01:15:08.958
You got a good head on you, you have.

01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:11.833
I don't want your life
being like mine.

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:14.833
Thanks for the advice, Dad.

01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:17.667
Are you done?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.292
One way or another,

01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:26.042
I've wondered about you
for a long time now.

01:15:27.292 --> 01:15:30.333
When I saw your mum picking
you up in that car park...

01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:33.875
You were real then,
and I wanted to know you.

01:15:34.917 --> 01:15:37.625
When I did know you,
the idea of not knowing you

01:15:37.792 --> 01:15:40.375
became a thing I couldn't allow.
I'm not missing another 17 years.

01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:42.125
Yeah, but you're leaving.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.292
And you'll visit.

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:52.333
After you finish school, you'll
come up for longer, if you want.

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:55.708
I fucked up. I know.
I know it's been shite.

01:15:57.458 --> 01:15:58.958
I ain't got time
to hang about round here.

01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:01.625
Everyone thinks
I'm a fucking paedo now.

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:06.000
Except I don't have the option
of fucking off.

01:16:08.667 --> 01:16:09.875
I know.

01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:20.958
- Laurie.
- Just going to the toilet.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.625
I love you. I love you.

01:16:40.958 --> 01:16:43.125
Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:47.917 --> 01:16:49.167
Yeah.

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:32.167
- Ik heet.
- Ik heet.

01:17:34.958 --> 01:17:37.500
- Goedenavond.
- Goedenavond.

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:41.667
- Tot ziens.
- You're just making 'em up now.

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.792
I'm not. It's from the--I read it...

01:17:47.542 --> 01:17:48.833
...in the dictionary.

01:17:58.917 --> 01:18:01.208
So maybe you could move away with me.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:05.042
Yeah?

01:18:06.917 --> 01:18:08.625
I'm gonna move away with you.

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.167
- Goedenavond!
- Goedenavond.

01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:16.083
Where are we gonna live?

01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:19.417
Big fuck-off castle...

01:18:21.458 --> 01:18:22.958
with turrets...

01:18:24.875 --> 01:18:27.208
and a drawbridge.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:35.000
I just wanna know
everything about you...

01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:40.625
...everything I missed.

01:19:21.417 --> 01:19:22.708
Pete!

01:20:07.417 --> 01:20:08.958
You be good, yeah?

01:20:10.917 --> 01:20:12.125
I will.

01:20:16.083 --> 01:20:19.750
Don't get in--in any cars
with any strangers, right?

01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:32.042
Dickhead!

01:20:32.458 --> 01:20:33.833
Well, go on then.

01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:43.458
Come visit.
