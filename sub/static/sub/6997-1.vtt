WAR IS CRUELTY

00:36.373 --> 00:40.607
WAR IS CRUELTY
THERE IS NO USE TRYING TO REFORM IT

00:40.632 --> 00:44.374
THE CRUELER IT IS, THE SOONER IT WILL BE OVER

03:50.977 --> 03:58.685
THE KEEPING ROOM

07:29.771 --> 07:31.805
Heard you shoot.

07:37.626 --> 07:39.393
What was it?

07:43.341 --> 07:46.219
Somethin' small n' fast.

07:48.304 --> 07:50.020
Rabbit?

07:52.893 --> 07:54.853
Maybe.

07:57.507 --> 08:00.227
I don't know if it was
even really there.

08:02.235 --> 08:04.638
Once that gun goes off,

08:05.377 --> 08:08.495
everythin' livin' is gone.

08:11.204 --> 08:15.323
Why's it so hard when the only thing
there's you and the rabbit?

08:17.461 --> 08:20.912
The wood is big
and the rabbit's small.

08:26.238 --> 08:28.143
Can I start?

08:29.133 --> 08:31.318
Yes, we all goin' to.

08:34.043 --> 08:36.506
I was asking my sister.

08:37.578 --> 08:40.351
No need to talk
to Mad like that.

08:48.786 --> 08:50.918
Don't you want to eat?

10:33.025 --> 10:35.018
I'm cold.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.893
What?
What is it?

11:28.001 --> 11:29.951
I saw 'em.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.079
Saw who?

11:36.010 --> 11:38.658
Daddy and Nathaniel.

11:45.187 --> 11:47.638
It's only a dream.

11:48.190 --> 11:50.623
But I was right there.

11:56.907 --> 11:59.428
Go back to sleep.

12:01.797 --> 12:05.295
I can't stop hopin'
they might come home.

12:09.952 --> 12:13.728
Our father and brother
ain't desertin' no duty.

12:16.821 --> 12:19.838
It was like it was
really happenin',

12:19.863 --> 12:22.007
they needed me.

12:25.788 --> 12:29.103
What happens when
you sleep ain't real.

12:33.655 --> 12:37.749
Come here.
Come sleep next to me.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.651
I look like her.

14:00.657 --> 14:02.428
You do.

14:06.354 --> 14:09.738
This dress feel so
nice on my skin.

14:10.492 --> 14:12.755
Almost fits me now.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.016
You should take it off.

14:16.275 --> 14:18.601
But I just put it on.

14:23.340 --> 14:26.309
Louise, I best not see
that dress movin' again.

14:53.299 --> 14:55.737
Thought I told you
to take that off?

14:56.252 --> 14:58.209
I didn't feel like it.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.179
Louise, I'm asking you, please.

15:10.209 --> 15:14.167
- Why you care so much?
- Because you gonna ruin it.

15:21.794 --> 15:24.084
Don't feel like hoein'.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.883
Don't like her lookin'
at me that way either!

15:38.088 --> 15:40.711
Go change and come back to work.

15:42.527 --> 15:45.271
She's the nigger,
she should do it.

15:51.829 --> 15:54.193
Like I told you, Louise:

15:55.032 --> 15:57.331
We all niggers now.

17:32.397 --> 17:34.314
Augusta!

17:50.500 --> 17:52.895
Louise!
What happened?

17:53.200 --> 17:56.946
- Louise, what happened?
- Raccoon.

17:59.051 --> 18:01.249
She was suppose to
be workin' with you!

18:01.274 --> 18:04.198
I can't keep eyes
on her all the time.

18:04.223 --> 18:08.075
There's work to do and sometimes
she's gotta learn what's right.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.610
We best get her inside.

18:42.946 --> 18:45.315
One, two, three.

18:50.978 --> 18:53.007
We need medcin'.

18:53.735 --> 18:56.780
Maybe they got somethin'
at the Weaver place.

18:58.947 --> 19:00.497
Let me.

19:16.568 --> 19:18.256
You should go.

20:07.783 --> 20:09.473
Clara?

20:11.773 --> 20:13.367
Hello?

20:15.637 --> 20:17.267
Mary?

20:35.940 --> 20:37.557
Clara?

20:46.003 --> 20:47.747
Mary?

22:53.066 --> 22:54.943
Thank you, girl.

23:24.036 --> 23:27.505
- Augusta.
- Caleb.

23:29.448 --> 23:32.047
You shouldn't be here.

23:38.253 --> 23:41.732
Have you seen anybody from out of the
Weaver place? Have you seen Clara?

23:41.757 --> 23:44.052
Mary was the last one I saw.

23:44.077 --> 23:45.826
Mary's dead.

23:46.821 --> 23:47.821
No.

23:47.846 --> 23:51.533
- Drank herself some poison.
- God forgive her.

23:51.558 --> 23:53.774
She just sitting up there.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.548
You come out here
just to tell me that?

23:57.315 --> 24:02.243
No.
Louise. Raccoon bit her.

24:06.325 --> 24:09.829
You need to turn around
and get yourself out of here.

24:26.723 --> 24:29.666
- Here.
- What's this for?

24:33.529 --> 24:35.772
You'll know it soon enough.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.596
Good girl.

24:54.002 --> 24:56.818
I went to the Weaver place
lookin' for medicine.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.357
Came here hopin' for better luck.

24:58.382 --> 25:01.703
There ain't been medcin'
here in a long time.

25:04.268 --> 25:09.125
- You should go 'fore they sober up.
- I can't go back with nothin'.

25:14.106 --> 25:15.807
Wait here.

25:51.889 --> 25:55.571
- Thought you said there wasn't no...
- I wouldn't call that medcin'.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.680
But it'll work?

26:03.222 --> 26:05.374
It might work.

26:11.242 --> 26:13.118
Where you ridin' to?

26:13.143 --> 26:15.399
Due east.
Night's ride.

26:15.424 --> 26:18.406
- What you ridin'?
- A dead horse.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.122
You're gettin' Captain.

26:30.721 --> 26:32.707
He's a good horse.

26:34.189 --> 26:36.777
Why are you bein'
so nice to me?

26:39.283 --> 26:44.524
I knew your daddy.
He was a good man.

26:47.769 --> 26:49.911
He was alright.

26:54.907 --> 26:56.414
Hey, how much uh
that you gonna...

26:56.439 --> 26:59.432
We're only savin' it for
someone who needs it.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.768
- I see you found more liquor.
- Sure thing.

27:07.793 --> 27:11.175
Yeah.
Here you go.

27:17.366 --> 27:19.242
Oh, what'd ya know?

27:19.933 --> 27:22.984
Eh, Moses. This place is
luckier than we thought.

27:24.795 --> 27:27.288
I didn't think they still made them...

27:28.753 --> 27:30.824
... pretty as this.

27:39.942 --> 27:41.730
You comin' over?

27:48.160 --> 27:49.960
Maybe later.

27:52.391 --> 27:55.091
- This' half empty!
- Yes.

27:55.116 --> 27:59.641
I have got some more, yeah.
Plenty more at... back.

28:13.510 --> 28:15.894
Go upstairs.

28:28.919 --> 28:31.681
You boys hungry for me?

28:46.661 --> 28:50.000
I bet you want some too?
Hmm.

29:04.450 --> 29:06.628
Hey, where you goin', honey?

29:10.397 --> 29:12.325
Ain't nothin' up there.

29:12.350 --> 29:15.373
Better things to do with
your mouth than talk.

29:48.976 --> 29:51.722
Don't think the dog
likes what you're doing.

29:51.747 --> 29:54.871
From what I seen that dog
don't like much 'uh anything.

30:46.897 --> 30:48.745
Battle.

30:48.896 --> 30:50.334
What?

30:52.796 --> 30:54.397
The dog.

30:56.770 --> 30:59.043
His name is Battle.

31:00.474 --> 31:02.810
He sure sounds like one.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.983
That's a mighty big horse
for a girl like you.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.964
You go on now, Augusta.

31:17.696 --> 31:19.816
Some place you got to be?

31:19.841 --> 31:21.423
I do.

31:21.543 --> 31:23.449
All on your own?

31:24.157 --> 31:28.821
No.
She's got people.

31:39.193 --> 31:41.069
You should go.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.071
Go on now.

31:57.597 --> 31:59.060
Go.

32:00.447 --> 32:01.886
Go on.

32:29.830 --> 32:31.686
Don't cry.

34:37.261 --> 34:39.737
You should try 'n sleep.

34:40.598 --> 34:42.500
Don't want to.

34:44.996 --> 34:48.351
I can just keep talkin' til you do...

34:49.963 --> 34:53.987
I remember daddy tellin' a story
about a girl 'n her sister.

35:04.665 --> 35:07.997
A girl was goin' to
be killed by a king.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.729
What king?

35:09.754 --> 35:14.342
- I don't know, some king somewhere.
- Why was he gonna kill her?

35:15.818 --> 35:19.289
I guess she musta done
somethin' he didn't like.

35:19.314 --> 35:21.006
Anyway.

35:21.330 --> 35:27.316
The whole town shows up for the
execution, includin' the girl's sister.

35:30.202 --> 35:35.218
And the sister goes over
to the girl, who's crying now,

35:36.314 --> 35:38.520
and she says,

35:39.026 --> 35:42.973
"When the king asks you
if you have any last words,

35:42.998 --> 35:46.600
you tell him that you want me
to tell you a story."

35:46.625 --> 35:50.580
So the king asks
and the girl says,

35:51.430 --> 35:54.575
"I want my sister
to tell me a story."

35:55.285 --> 35:58.139
And the king grants the request.

35:59.046 --> 36:02.664
The sister gets up
to the girl.

36:03.417 --> 36:07.261
She starts tellin' a story so good,

36:07.399 --> 36:10.514
the king can't help himself but listen.

36:11.215 --> 36:16.343
And dawn has come and gone
and now itâ€™s twilight.

36:16.368 --> 36:20.389
And the whole town
is still standin' there

36:20.414 --> 36:24.502
stock still,
their hearts in their throats.

36:24.527 --> 36:29.395
And all of a sudden,
at just the most excitin' part,

36:29.655 --> 36:31.257
she stopped.

36:31.793 --> 36:35.944
- Why?
- She says to the king,

36:36.783 --> 36:41.702
"You want to know the end?
I'll tell you tomorrow.

36:42.078 --> 36:45.135
If you give my sister
one more day."

36:45.811 --> 36:50.344
Now the town's people know that mean
old king is goin' to kill 'em both for sure,

36:50.604 --> 36:55.073
but the King,
needin' to know the end,

36:56.061 --> 36:58.038
says yes.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.975
What was the story she was tellin'?

37:01.000 --> 37:04.343
I only remember the part
'bout he tellin' it.

37:05.111 --> 37:07.800
Did the king kill the girl after?

37:07.825 --> 37:13.197
But, the next day, just as soon as
the sister finished telling that story,

37:13.222 --> 37:18.083
she starts another one, and she
stops that one 'fore the best part.

37:18.894 --> 37:23.722
and the same thing happens
the next night

37:24.346 --> 37:28.664
and the next night
and the next night

37:29.948 --> 37:32.833
for near a thousand nights.

37:33.107 --> 37:35.565
What happens to the girl?

37:36.680 --> 37:38.185
Well.

37:38.300 --> 37:41.464
As long as her sister
kept tellin' stories,

37:42.561 --> 37:45.049
she never dies.

37:48.072 --> 37:50.261
And her sister...

37:54.868 --> 37:57.995
I think after she told
all those stories,

37:59.809 --> 38:02.271
the king married her.

39:26.146 --> 39:28.823
Didn't know you needed
your mouth to walk proper.

39:28.975 --> 39:33.403
If you were the one bit, weâ€™d still be sitting
back at the whorehouse instead of moving.

39:35.418 --> 39:38.212
I won't actually call
what youâ€™re doing moving.

39:38.963 --> 39:42.359
- You sure weâ€™re going the right way?
- Road only goes one way.

39:42.384 --> 39:46.596
You know as well as I do, you can
go any way you want to on a...

39:47.187 --> 39:48.726
On a what?

39:49.593 --> 39:51.470
Road.

39:56.789 --> 39:57.978
We're going the right way.

39:58.003 --> 40:00.884
- Maybe we should stop a minute?
- Uh, Henry?

40:18.696 --> 40:20.767
What's he got?

40:25.985 --> 40:28.768
Looks like we're going
the right way after all.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.935
Dayâ€™s half over.

41:14.590 --> 41:19.318
Didnâ€™t wanna wake you.
She up too?

41:21.654 --> 41:23.322
No.

41:26.286 --> 41:29.917
Comin' back to life ainâ€™t easy.
She needs the rest.

41:33.672 --> 41:35.632
We got anything to drink?

41:36.169 --> 41:38.427
Yeah.

41:38.679 --> 41:40.797
Goat's milk.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.830
Thatâ€™s not what I meant.

41:51.164 --> 41:53.808
Gets easier the more you drink.

41:59.176 --> 42:01.859
Gets real easier.

42:10.139 --> 42:13.100
I like the way I feel.

42:17.185 --> 42:21.164
Bill was the only one
your Daddy let drink it.

42:21.195 --> 42:27.105
He used to come back
at night stinkin' and proud.

42:29.574 --> 42:33.660
You was with him?
Bill?

42:34.748 --> 42:36.583
I was.

42:37.248 --> 42:40.864
You wanted to have his babies.

42:40.889 --> 42:43.071
Oh, lord.

42:52.929 --> 42:54.974
You miss him?

42:57.396 --> 42:59.348
I do.

43:09.742 --> 43:11.458
Was he...

43:14.871 --> 43:16.612
Go on.

43:17.920 --> 43:22.514
With this moonshine in me Iâ€™m fixed
 to answer any question you got.

43:31.470 --> 43:33.781
What's it feel like?

43:36.063 --> 43:37.722
You'll know.

43:37.747 --> 43:39.471
What If I don't?

43:42.528 --> 43:45.776
What if all the men
kill all the other men?

43:46.699 --> 43:50.029
What if itâ€™s the end of the world
and we're the last ones left?

43:51.454 --> 43:53.916
It ainâ€™t the end of the world.

43:53.941 --> 43:57.993
Think 'bout all the women
sittin' in their houses.

43:58.212 --> 44:00.966
Were supposed to be taken,
but ainâ€™t.

44:02.049 --> 44:04.927
 Learned to shoot a gun
'fore they learned to bed.

44:06.179 --> 44:09.224
Learned to be men
instead 'uh a wife.

44:19.109 --> 44:20.844
I'm hungry.

44:21.361 --> 44:23.698
Did she say...

44:24.775 --> 44:26.553
...hungry.

44:32.170 --> 44:35.916
- What did you say?
- I'm hungry.

44:37.517 --> 44:39.979
Say it again.

44:40.967 --> 44:42.779
I'm hungry.

44:43.307 --> 44:45.851
- She is hungry!
- She is hungry!

44:47.599 --> 44:53.482
Iâ€™m gonna cook you
somethin' so good, Louise.

44:53.605 --> 44:57.938
Come-back-from-the-dead stew,
thatâ€™s what.

44:57.963 --> 45:00.758
Come-back-from-the-dead stew!

45:00.783 --> 45:03.797
Best stew I ever made.

45:56.192 --> 45:57.882
Fern.

46:20.032 --> 46:21.560
Hey.

46:22.539 --> 46:24.577
- Mad.
- What?

46:24.602 --> 46:26.128
Shhh.

46:27.040 --> 46:32.059
- Why you wake me just to be quiet?
- Listen, just-just listen.

46:35.882 --> 46:38.510
Probably a ghost.

46:40.930 --> 46:42.984
Come have a look with me?

47:37.957 --> 47:40.211
Who's firing?

47:41.621 --> 47:43.684
Show yourself!

47:43.741 --> 47:45.372
Get inside!

47:45.405 --> 47:47.556
Go, get inside now!

47:53.175 --> 47:54.953
Louise, wake up!

47:54.978 --> 47:56.845
- Louise, wake up!
- Whatâ€™s goin' on?

47:56.870 --> 48:00.479
We got men here.
They are soldiers. Yankees.

48:00.504 --> 48:01.504
How you know that?

48:01.529 --> 48:04.876
You shot this dog!

48:07.133 --> 48:10.726
He was just a dog.

48:10.751 --> 48:13.838
Same as you and me.

48:13.863 --> 48:18.199
You went and shot him down.

48:18.224 --> 48:21.956
Couldnâ€™t let him be.

48:22.373 --> 48:28.770
And now thereâ€™s no more drink.
And thereâ€™s no more dog.

48:28.795 --> 48:36.488
We only have this gun.
And Iâ€™m through with my song.

48:36.513 --> 48:38.562
We got any other guns?

48:40.482 --> 48:43.891
Downstairs.
In one of the drawers.

48:44.776 --> 48:46.810
I'm goin' to go get
it and come back.

48:46.835 --> 48:47.876
Letâ€™s get to the Keepin' Room.

48:47.901 --> 48:49.377
We ainâ€™t leavin' this house.

48:49.402 --> 48:52.337
-Too many doors and windows and rooms.
- We goin' to fight.

48:52.362 --> 48:54.533
I don't wanna fight.

48:55.070 --> 48:57.804
We can hide.
They donâ€™t know we here.

48:57.829 --> 49:01.141
I just shot their dog,
they gonna come lookin'.

49:01.166 --> 49:03.876
How you know what dog
belong to what Yankees?

49:03.901 --> 49:05.798
'Cause they followed me.

49:08.396 --> 49:09.521
Don't leave us.

49:09.553 --> 49:12.301
We ain't goin' to wait all night.

49:12.481 --> 49:13.727
Augusta.

49:13.752 --> 49:16.882
- You want them here?
- No.

49:19.561 --> 49:21.719
Then I gotta go down.

49:33.702 --> 49:35.576
Girl.

49:36.223 --> 49:38.411
Who else you got in there?
You got men?

49:38.436 --> 49:40.606
Negros or cowards?

49:51.746 --> 49:55.628
Girl!
Where are you?

51:47.316 --> 51:48.594
No!

51:49.335 --> 51:51.727
Moses!

51:51.851 --> 51:54.391
Moses!

51:59.647 --> 52:03.252
Help me!
Moses!

52:03.277 --> 52:05.784
- Sorry.
- Here.

52:10.584 --> 52:12.971
Shhhhh.

52:17.916 --> 52:19.806
Why you naked?

52:20.882 --> 52:23.967
There was a fire.
I had to put it out.

52:23.992 --> 52:25.154
What?

52:25.179 --> 52:28.022
Get over here.
This is your gun.

52:28.047 --> 52:29.870
I gotta reload.
Watch me and do as I do.

52:29.895 --> 52:33.301
Take the powder.
Take the powder, put it in.

52:33.326 --> 52:35.985
Take the ball,
put it in.

52:36.149 --> 52:37.794
Push it down.

52:40.549 --> 52:42.327
Pull this back.

52:43.419 --> 52:44.893
- You hold steady.
- All right.

52:44.918 --> 52:46.618
And you pull this.

52:46.643 --> 52:48.147
Yeah.
All right.

52:48.172 --> 52:49.768
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

52:49.793 --> 52:51.448
- You sure.
- Yes. Yes.

52:51.999 --> 52:53.542
Girl!

52:54.919 --> 52:56.797
Girl!

53:00.926 --> 53:06.438
You got ten to come out
or weâ€™re coming in.

53:10.019 --> 53:11.586
One!

53:13.023 --> 53:14.566
Two!

53:15.077 --> 53:17.098
Iâ€™m gonna try n' draw 'em
away from the house.

53:17.123 --> 53:18.635
No, don't.
No.

53:18.660 --> 53:20.367
You bar this door behind me.

53:20.392 --> 53:23.565
If a man comes through,
no matter what, you shoot.

53:24.018 --> 53:25.728
Four!

53:29.545 --> 53:31.255
Five!

53:34.626 --> 53:36.327
Six!

53:43.180 --> 53:44.940
Seven!

53:50.927 --> 53:52.471
Eight!

54:10.235 --> 54:12.121
Nine!

54:23.433 --> 54:24.977
Ten!

54:27.008 --> 54:29.279
Shhh.
Shhhh.

55:03.517 --> 55:05.604
You followed me?

55:08.237 --> 55:10.116
Yeah, I did.

55:13.335 --> 55:16.192
Why didnâ€™t you kill me
with Caleb and that woman?

55:20.487 --> 55:23.335
I wanted to keep
you for a while.

57:16.668 --> 57:21.674
Damp powder.
Must be as old as this gun.

57:32.971 --> 57:35.996
Something about you
makes me wanna..

57:37.477 --> 57:39.289
sit down.

57:42.325 --> 57:45.071
Then why you come
like you want a war?

57:50.357 --> 57:52.733
I donâ€™t know how to stop.

58:01.727 --> 58:03.720
Why don't you come on out?

58:06.399 --> 58:08.578
I wanna see you.

58:31.934 --> 58:34.791
Why donâ€™t we just
put down the guns?

58:37.850 --> 58:40.767
We can get a lot closer
without them.

58:58.068 --> 59:00.869
Well.
Maybe it's just you and me now.

59:31.601 --> 59:37.333
If you don't stand still,
I just might have to shoot you.

59:50.686 --> 59:52.197
Quiet!

59:59.798 --> 01:00:03.942
Don't make me hurt you.

01:03:43.156 --> 01:03:44.652
Go on.

01:04:12.531 --> 01:04:14.866
At my second farm,

01:04:16.034 --> 01:04:19.105
there was this one shed
we wasnâ€™t allowed at.

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:23.053
All the other buildings
had their jobs.

01:04:23.585 --> 01:04:27.739
One for feed.
One for tools.

01:04:29.507 --> 01:04:32.963
But there was this one shed
we was told never to go in.

01:04:33.312 --> 01:04:38.475
Not to play near it.
Not to get curious.

01:04:39.393 --> 01:04:42.254
We made up all sorts of stories.

01:04:42.736 --> 01:04:46.785
Gold.
Ghosts.

01:04:47.544 --> 01:04:49.388
God.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:58.476
Then, one day when I was 'bout ten
the man told me to go to the shed.

01:05:00.565 --> 01:05:06.033
I was goin' to the shed.
I would get to know.

01:05:08.018 --> 01:05:13.080
I walked to the shed,
my heart comin' out my dress.

01:05:14.169 --> 01:05:18.034
I was gonna get to know.
I was gonna get to know.

01:05:18.059 --> 01:05:22.121
I was gonna be the one
to tell all the others.

01:05:28.448 --> 01:05:30.395
I opened the door.

01:05:30.774 --> 01:05:34.708
Only thing in there was
a low cot and no windows.

01:05:36.068 --> 01:05:38.876
I stood there a minute
so unsure.

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:41.923
So sad.

01:05:42.398 --> 01:05:45.885
Wonderin' why we wasnâ€™t
supposed to know for so long.

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:53.005
And then the man come in.

01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:56.340
And he had me.

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:03.667
He was so big
and I was so small.

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:08.429
So small that I didnâ€™t even know
what was happenin'.

01:06:12.066 --> 01:06:16.993
That was the first time.
And there were many more.

01:06:21.838 --> 01:06:24.752
Some times they cut the baby out.

01:06:25.845 --> 01:06:28.000
Other times, they keeps them.

01:06:29.914 --> 01:06:32.073
I don't know where they are now.

01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:43.684
There are many kinds of
monsters in this world,

01:06:44.123 --> 01:06:47.028
you never know which one
goin' to be yours.

01:06:47.843 --> 01:06:50.254
Donâ€™t know what happened to mine.

01:06:50.426 --> 01:06:53.329
Probably died old and happy.

01:06:54.487 --> 01:06:56.838
But yours...

01:06:58.847 --> 01:07:00.831
You killed him.

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:03.971
- That right?
- Yes.

01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:08.014
Your monster's dead.

01:08:54.292 --> 01:08:56.550
You come back.

01:08:57.506 --> 01:08:59.227
Yeah.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.152
I just wanted to hear
that old voice again.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.651
It's over.

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:17.966
- It's all over.
- What you mean?

01:09:19.765 --> 01:09:22.018
You take shelter.

01:09:25.643 --> 01:09:27.598
They comin'.

01:09:30.634 --> 01:09:32.676
They...

01:10:16.155 --> 01:10:17.982
Where is Augusta?

01:10:24.308 --> 01:10:26.032
Mad?

01:11:05.024 --> 01:11:07.123
Whatâ€™s goin' on?

01:11:11.349 --> 01:11:13.523
He come back.

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:22.472
I ainâ€™t angry with you, Augusta.

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:27.452
I's angry 'cause I come close
to killin' him myself.

01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:31.452
But we wanted him dead.

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:38.807
He'd never forgiven me
if Iâ€™s the one done it.

01:11:49.278 --> 01:11:54.086
When you gonna learn
what donâ€™t happen donâ€™t matter?

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:56.684
You just goes on.

01:12:15.682 --> 01:12:18.902
Might be another man
out there want us dead.

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:23.243
Ainâ€™t no time
to think on love.

01:12:24.482 --> 01:12:27.229
There is another man out there.

01:12:32.176 --> 01:12:34.440
We ainâ€™t goin' to wait for him.

01:12:35.597 --> 01:12:38.145
We goin' out there to hunt him.

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.655
And we ainâ€™t come back
'til he ours.

01:15:01.367 --> 01:15:03.795
This some fine moonshine.

01:15:10.304 --> 01:15:12.246
Our daddy made it.

01:15:12.271 --> 01:15:15.018
Your daddy made
some fine moonshine.

01:15:22.091 --> 01:15:24.252
I've been waiting for you.

01:15:26.425 --> 01:15:28.497
I've been looking for you.

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:31.804
You found me.

01:15:44.203 --> 01:15:46.219
I like this room.

01:15:49.314 --> 01:15:51.152
I like it too.

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:00.128
What's your name?

01:16:06.481 --> 01:16:08.264
Moses.

01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:12.372
Like the baby.

01:16:13.774 --> 01:16:15.924
Yes, just like.

01:16:20.361 --> 01:16:22.618
Why're you doin' this, Moses?

01:16:25.613 --> 01:16:28.677
Me an' him are bummers.
We...

01:16:30.177 --> 01:16:37.196
We're sent ahead to forage
the land for food and deserters

01:16:37.656 --> 01:16:40.605
and survivors.

01:16:41.094 --> 01:16:48.341
Whole army is behind us.
Already took Georgia.

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:51.818
Uncle Billy's coming.

01:16:52.054 --> 01:16:54.843
Burning down every thing
in his path.

01:16:54.878 --> 01:16:59.737
Rest assured,
itâ€™ll be cruel.

01:17:01.539 --> 01:17:07.806
And the crueler it is
the sooner itâ€™ll be over.

01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:15.024
We can hold 'em.

01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:20.115
Girl, I believe you can.

01:17:24.754 --> 01:17:28.668
You know how many
battles I fought in?

01:17:28.693 --> 01:17:31.643
Donâ€™t seem like many,
easy as you went down.

01:17:32.891 --> 01:17:34.643
No.
It don't.

01:17:37.494 --> 01:17:39.481
 But it was.

01:17:41.827 --> 01:17:43.984
And yet, here I sit.

01:17:51.296 --> 01:17:55.770
Fuck.
You are beautiful.

01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:04.820
I'd like to know your name.

01:18:08.923 --> 01:18:10.638
Augusta.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.357
Augusta.

01:18:16.889 --> 01:18:19.585
Augusta and Moses.

01:19:10.173 --> 01:19:12.537
Things could have be different.

01:19:19.401 --> 01:19:21.347
But they ain't.

01:19:26.032 --> 01:19:28.203
I know that it's over.

01:19:30.741 --> 01:19:32.749
Truth be told,

01:19:36.131 --> 01:19:38.212
Iâ€™m heartened.

01:19:41.716 --> 01:19:44.783
Don't think I know
my way home from here.

01:19:53.116 --> 01:19:56.152
Iâ€™d appreciate it if youâ€™d
show me the way.

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:21.618
You 'bout finished with your drink?

01:20:26.133 --> 01:20:27.880
Just about.

01:21:46.697 --> 01:21:50.442
How strange he show up
here lookin' like a Yankee.

01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:03.199
Maybe he was free.

01:22:07.777 --> 01:22:10.008
And he came back.

01:22:11.995 --> 01:22:16.220
I didnâ€™t know people looked the same
whether they was dead or alive.

01:22:21.982 --> 01:22:24.106
He gone.

01:22:25.468 --> 01:22:28.179
But he donâ€™t look so bad.

01:22:29.296 --> 01:22:32.039
Like heâ€™s sleepin' maybe.

01:22:40.142 --> 01:22:42.413
He look dead.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:47.602
But he look good.

01:22:52.247 --> 01:22:55.709
You sure you donâ€™t wanna
dig him another hole?

01:22:58.718 --> 01:23:03.016
Ain't time.
Ain't strength.

01:23:03.041 --> 01:23:06.315
Donâ€™t think he should go
in the same place as them.

01:23:09.023 --> 01:23:13.354
Donâ€™t worry.
They ainâ€™t goin' to the same place.

01:23:54.648 --> 01:23:56.499
Augusta!

01:24:08.224 --> 01:24:11.137
Looks like the skyâ€™s on fire.

01:24:13.283 --> 01:24:15.989
Looks like the whole worldâ€™s on fire.

01:24:19.517 --> 01:24:21.406
They comin'.

01:24:30.150 --> 01:24:32.019
This our home.

01:24:34.336 --> 01:24:36.225
We gonna have to fight.

01:24:40.579 --> 01:24:42.656
