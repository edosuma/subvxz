Yeah, just a couple

Did you have

04:33.849 --> 04:36.152
- Yep.
- At least you did.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.322
Maybe this'll
cheer you up.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.226
Take it.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.404
It's for you.

04:56.804 --> 04:59.472
A couple of the big ones
for us.

04:59.474 --> 05:01.377
You're crazy.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.813
- Where you goin'?
- Castili doesn't want me leaving early.

05:06.815 --> 05:08.784
To hell with Castili.

05:10.751 --> 05:12.621
Let's go have some fun.

05:13.921 --> 05:16.392
Turn that frown
upside-down.

05:19.794 --> 05:21.163
I know you
wanna have some fun.

05:40.282 --> 05:41.750
I love you.

05:42.851 --> 05:44.153
<i>Say that again.</i>

05:44.919 --> 05:46.455
Slower.

05:46.921 --> 05:48.323
I...

05:50.258 --> 05:51.426
love...

05:54.296 --> 05:55.130
you.

06:06.308 --> 06:07.710
I want a house.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.181
In the countryside,
like where you grew up.

06:13.782 --> 06:17.219
You make it sound so nice, riding
your little horsey around.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.622
Let's go today.

06:21.488 --> 06:23.957
How am I gonna earn
in the country?

06:23.959 --> 06:25.895
There's nothing to steal.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.729
We'll get jobs.

06:29.731 --> 06:34.436
I made more last night than most
people in the country make in a year.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.837
Gimme six months.

06:37.839 --> 06:41.476
I'll be making more money
than Castili and all those bums.

06:51.519 --> 06:52.655
Hey.

07:09.570 --> 07:11.239
I don't want to wait
six months.

07:16.745 --> 07:18.747
I'm here for the rent.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.914
All right.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

07:27.722 --> 07:29.756
- It's him.
- What the fuck?

07:29.758 --> 07:32.392
You're under arrest for
the murder of Roland Legrand.

07:32.394 --> 07:33.859
What are you talkin' about?

07:33.861 --> 07:35.931
Well, he was murdered last night.
A witness identified you.

07:37.299 --> 07:38.364
The pimp,
Roland Legrand.

07:38.366 --> 07:41.633
You know him, right?

07:41.635 --> 07:45.304
- You got the wrong guy, pal. I was with her all night.
- Come on. Let's go.

07:45.306 --> 07:47.407
- All right. Let me get dressed.
- No, no, no, no.

07:47.409 --> 07:49.577
We got some stripes at the
station for you, pretty boy.

07:50.378 --> 07:51.677
This is bullshit.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.412
- I didn't kill anyone.
- You can't do that.

07:53.414 --> 07:55.314
- He was with me!
- Nennete, relax.

07:55.316 --> 07:57.417
- They got nothin'.
- Nobody believes a whore.

07:57.419 --> 07:59.451
- Nennete!
- Get back in your room.

07:59.453 --> 08:01.520
Honestly,
I'll be back in no time.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.357
- Papi! Papi!
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.561
Papi!

08:08.496 --> 08:10.362
Papi!

08:10.364 --> 08:11.664
Papi!

08:11.666 --> 08:13.700
He didn't kill anyone!

08:13.702 --> 08:16.068
He was with me!

08:56.477 --> 08:58.046
Step away from the bars!

08:59.747 --> 09:01.749
I can't believe they gave
you a life sentence.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.523
You need to appeal.

09:08.088 --> 09:09.757
Appeal what?

09:11.458 --> 09:13.593
Nennete,
this is a frame-up.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.431
They're all in on it.

09:17.064 --> 09:19.034
I just need to concentrate
on breaking out.

09:20.401 --> 09:22.100
Okay.

09:22.102 --> 09:25.537
First thing I'm gonna do when I get
back is kill that lying rat witness

09:25.539 --> 09:27.873
and anyone who has anything
to do with this.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.678
- Calm down.
- All visitors have to leave!

09:31.880 --> 09:33.881
Nennete, you need
to forget about me.

09:35.884 --> 09:37.919
Don't say that.

09:39.053 --> 09:40.452
I love you.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.821
- Time's up, lady.
- Papi, I love you.

09:42.823 --> 09:46.426
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

09:46.428 --> 09:49.061
- Come on. Come on. Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

09:58.573 --> 10:01.110
Papillon, right?
They fucked you good, huh?

10:02.043 --> 10:03.812
Framed you
for murder.

10:05.013 --> 10:07.213
Say you're one hell
of a safecracker.

10:07.215 --> 10:09.451
I'm more of a smash-and-grab
guy myself. Name's Julot.

10:11.218 --> 10:12.688
Got any money?

10:13.587 --> 10:15.854
No?

10:15.856 --> 10:18.760
Get some. You'll never
escape without it.

10:22.463 --> 10:24.564
Keep goin', keep goin'.
Let's keep goin'.

10:24.566 --> 10:27.133
- Next. Move forward.
- Next, come on!

10:27.135 --> 10:29.404
- Let's go, let's go.
- Next.

10:30.103 --> 10:32.573
- Line up.
- Go to the end.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.976
Come on. Move along.

10:39.079 --> 10:41.080
- Stay in line.
- Hey.

10:41.082 --> 10:44.984
- Perhaps I could speak with your supervisor.
- Sure.

10:44.986 --> 10:46.587
Whatever you say.

10:48.590 --> 10:52.557
Louis Dega.
Guy's a millionaire.

10:52.559 --> 10:55.261
Busted making counterfeit
defense bonds.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.763
- Won't last long.
- Next.

10:57.765 --> 11:00.899
Every con in the prison will wanna cut
him open to get the money he's carrying.

11:00.901 --> 11:02.737
Next.

11:08.141 --> 11:10.676
<i>As of this moment,</i>

11:10.678 --> 11:15.248
<i>you are the property of the Penal
Administration of French Guiana.</i>

11:15.250 --> 11:17.950
<i>After serving
your full term in prison,</i>

11:17.952 --> 11:20.952
<i>you will remain in South America</i>

11:20.954 --> 11:26.060
<i>as workers and colonists for a period
equal to that of your original sentence.</i>

11:27.728 --> 11:32.800
<i>This is for the greater good
that is French expansion.</i>

11:33.834 --> 11:35.503
<i>As for France...</i>

11:36.638 --> 11:39.772
<i>she has disowned you.</i>

11:39.774 --> 11:44.913
<i>She has rid herself
of you... altogether.</i>

11:45.847 --> 11:48.650
Forget France.

11:49.851 --> 11:51.953
Now dress yourselves.

12:05.232 --> 12:06.865
Are we going to hell?

12:06.867 --> 12:08.803
Look up. Just keep walking.

12:17.845 --> 12:19.515
Mr. Dega.

12:21.816 --> 12:23.950
Your appeal is
in a few weeks.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.687
Be strong, Louis.
I love you.

12:27.020 --> 12:27.990
I love you.

12:29.723 --> 12:30.922
You'll be home
before Christmas.

12:30.924 --> 12:35.229
Dega. Mr. Dega, here.
Look this way. Mr. Dega.

12:50.010 --> 12:52.177
Sixty-nine, 70.

12:52.179 --> 12:54.346
- That's right.
- Move it!

12:54.348 --> 12:55.748
That's enough.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.719
Pick your feet up.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.264
Hey, Julot!

13:13.266 --> 13:14.300
All right, pair up.

13:14.302 --> 13:15.904
- Hey.
- Take the corner.

13:21.141 --> 13:23.311
Looks like Dega's
making friends already.

13:24.812 --> 13:28.015
Julot, make sure
no one takes this hammock.

13:31.919 --> 13:33.786
Hey.

13:33.788 --> 13:37.023
I saved you a spot next to me.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.760
You got a lot of eyes on you.

13:40.127 --> 13:42.360
I can keep you safe.

13:42.362 --> 13:44.866
All I need's enough money
for an escape.

13:46.233 --> 13:48.300
Won't be cheap,
but you'll be safe.

13:48.302 --> 13:51.037
Said the scorpion to the frog.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.739
We're all scorpions
in here, pal.

13:53.741 --> 13:57.442
I think I'd be better off taking my chances
setting up in front of the guards.

13:57.444 --> 13:59.912
Wouldn't you agree?

13:59.914 --> 14:02.650
You seem like the kind of man
who can make up his own mind.

14:03.784 --> 14:05.886
You're a good judge
of character.

14:08.155 --> 14:10.058
Have a good night.

14:10.824 --> 14:12.660
Yeah, you too.

14:20.034 --> 14:21.300
Hey.

14:21.302 --> 14:23.105
Me and you, we should team up
for an escape.

14:25.206 --> 14:29.211
If I get caught in some half-assed
escape, I want it to be my mistake.

14:33.948 --> 14:35.384
Settle down now!

15:18.125 --> 15:19.792
Shh.

15:34.007 --> 15:36.811
I know you hide your money
in your guts.

16:22.222 --> 16:23.357
Upper deck.

16:24.457 --> 16:25.392
Move it back.
Back, you.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.326
Back. Back up.

16:28.328 --> 16:29.765
Get him outta here.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.298
The animals can clean up
their own mess.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.133
Come on. Get rid of him.

16:35.135 --> 16:36.804
Show's over.

17:03.531 --> 17:05.834
How'd you sleep last night?

17:12.505 --> 17:14.939
Smells like freedom.

17:14.941 --> 17:17.344
What, you've heard of someone
escaping the prison?

17:18.411 --> 17:20.279
Doesn't mean
it can't be done.

17:20.281 --> 17:23.281
I have trouble seeing hope
in hopelessness.

17:23.284 --> 17:25.252
That's why I need
a man like you.

17:26.887 --> 17:29.221
I've reconsidered your offer.

17:29.223 --> 17:32.625
Keep me alive until
I'm set up on the island,

17:32.627 --> 17:34.930
I'll underwrite any escape
you care to arrange.

17:41.601 --> 17:43.004
All right.

17:45.973 --> 17:48.443
And when the time comes,
you're not comin' with me.

17:50.544 --> 17:53.378
I have no intention
of escaping.

17:53.380 --> 17:56.048
Unlike you,
I enjoy being alive.

17:56.050 --> 17:58.082
My wife's working
on my appeal.

17:58.084 --> 18:00.454
I'm confident
I'll be home by Christmas.

18:03.157 --> 18:05.293
A fellow optimist.

18:18.038 --> 18:20.040
Four.

18:20.507 --> 18:21.308
Two.

18:49.370 --> 18:51.973
Look what the fuck you did!

19:01.114 --> 19:01.982
Get the knife!

19:03.650 --> 19:05.519
Come on!
Get the knife!

19:08.989 --> 19:10.357
Get the knife!

19:43.256 --> 19:45.256
I'll kill you!

19:45.258 --> 19:47.594
Steam! Turn on the steam!

19:48.461 --> 19:49.396
Fuck you!

20:09.050 --> 20:10.581
Come on,
come on, come on.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.253
Get back!

20:14.755 --> 20:17.755
Strip and line up, you fuckin'
animals, or it's the steam again.

20:17.757 --> 20:20.458
Strip down!

20:20.460 --> 20:22.360
Gimme the fuckin' knife.

20:22.362 --> 20:24.463
- Move it!
- Come on. Line up back there!

20:24.465 --> 20:27.499
Let's go! Strip down!

20:27.501 --> 20:30.234
- Come on, come on.
- On your feet.

20:30.236 --> 20:32.337
Line up back there.

20:32.339 --> 20:34.773
Strip down.
Strip right up.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.408
Hands. Hands out.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.778
- Everybody, hands out.
- Everyone, let's have your hands out.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.513
Let's see.
What you got?

20:41.515 --> 20:42.814
Get him to the infirmary.

20:42.816 --> 20:44.782
Let's get this
piece of meat outta here.

20:44.784 --> 20:46.784
- Show me your hands. Let's see.
- Turn 'em over.

20:46.786 --> 20:48.352
You.

20:48.354 --> 20:50.355
This one's been fighting
for sure.

20:50.357 --> 20:52.124
Take him to first class.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.859
Come on. Come on!

20:54.861 --> 20:56.561
Time to go.

20:56.563 --> 20:58.033
First class, let's go.

20:59.432 --> 21:02.036
Try and behave, ladies.

21:35.602 --> 21:37.104
You should have finished him.

21:39.372 --> 21:40.507
I don't want to kill anyone.

21:44.812 --> 21:47.612
I'm gonna get myself sent
to the hospital.

21:47.614 --> 21:49.781
Let me know if a guard
looks this way.

21:49.783 --> 21:52.285
- Do not stop!
- Get a move on!

21:56.157 --> 21:57.222
Shh.

21:59.293 --> 22:01.629
Move it, now! You two!

22:04.631 --> 22:06.798
- Move it! Move it!
- Crazy, Julot.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.534
Go that way! You go this way!
You two, come on down.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.503
Form a line.

22:11.505 --> 22:14.305
Form a line, I said.
Form a line. Go ahead.

22:14.307 --> 22:16.707
You two, you stay here.
Go back in line.

22:16.709 --> 22:17.743
Move.

22:17.745 --> 22:19.945
Move it! Come on!
That way!

22:19.947 --> 22:22.747
Come on! Move it!
Come on.

22:22.749 --> 22:25.551
I said move it, goddamn it.
Get up. Get up!

22:25.553 --> 22:26.885
- Come on.
- Move along! Move along!

22:26.887 --> 22:28.820
Eyes straight.
Eyes straight.

22:28.822 --> 22:30.722
- Come on. Move it.
- Move it!

22:30.724 --> 22:32.291
- That way.
- Down the ladder!

22:32.293 --> 22:33.792
- Over there. Come on.
- Faster!

22:33.794 --> 22:35.459
Move it. Move it!

22:35.461 --> 22:37.228
- Come on now.
- Come on. Move.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.398
Don't be looking at me
like that.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.965
- Come on. Move.
- You too.

22:40.967 --> 22:42.900
Move along.

22:42.902 --> 22:45.270
Guys, get him up!

22:45.272 --> 22:48.676
My fucking leg!

22:50.878 --> 22:53.678
My leg. My leg!

22:56.917 --> 22:59.717
That's enough.
That's enough.

22:59.719 --> 23:01.919
Break it up. Break it up.
That's enough.

23:01.921 --> 23:03.988
- Move it!
- Move. Back to the line.

23:03.990 --> 23:05.557
Move, move.

23:05.559 --> 23:07.428
<i>Raise your hand
if I call your name.</i>

23:08.562 --> 23:10.231
Augustin.

23:12.399 --> 23:15.503
- Barba.
- Come on now. Stay in line.

23:16.303 --> 23:17.705
Bellaire.

23:18.671 --> 23:20.438
Move along! Over there.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.177
Lofton.

23:24.711 --> 23:26.513
Navarrone.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.314
Navarrone.

23:30.316 --> 23:31.351
Move out!

23:33.320 --> 23:34.722
Move out!

23:53.506 --> 23:55.677
All right, come on.
Move it.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.647
Keep moving!

24:03.816 --> 24:05.852
Prisoners, halt!

24:07.321 --> 24:08.289
Open the gates.

24:10.390 --> 24:11.758
March.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.378
I know many of you at this very
moment are thinking about escape.

25:39.380 --> 25:42.046
Feel free to try
whenever you like.

25:42.048 --> 25:43.850
We'll be happy to shoot you.

25:45.419 --> 25:48.686
If, however, you should
avoid that mercy,

25:48.688 --> 25:52.690
there are two guardians
who are always on duty...

25:52.692 --> 25:55.896
The bush, where the best thing that
can happen to you is starvation.

25:57.163 --> 25:59.997
Or you could choose the sea,

25:59.999 --> 26:02.936
where sharks too, I assure
you, are always hungry.

26:04.871 --> 26:07.872
If you manage to survive
your first attempt,

26:07.874 --> 26:10.841
you'll get two years
in solitary.

26:10.843 --> 26:13.011
Second attempt,
five years in solitary,

26:13.013 --> 26:15.515
followed by a life sentence
at Devil's Island.

26:16.917 --> 26:18.619
If you commit murder...

26:20.454 --> 26:21.989
you'll be executed.

26:24.024 --> 26:25.426
That's all.

26:42.176 --> 26:43.745
Move. Move.

26:58.559 --> 27:00.695
Jesus Christ.

27:09.769 --> 27:11.438
Take the corner.

27:20.647 --> 27:22.617
Hey, keep your eyes open
and don't move.

27:25.752 --> 27:26.988
Hey.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.125
Who decides what work
we get assigned to?

27:33.861 --> 27:36.863
- Excuse my ill-mannered...
- I thought I told you not to move.

27:38.064 --> 27:39.731
He has yet to be tamed.

27:39.733 --> 27:42.801
And you're obviously a very
important, very, very busy man.

27:42.803 --> 27:44.802
I'm just the turnkey.

27:44.804 --> 27:49.107
We're looking for someone
to ensure we're assigned

27:49.109 --> 27:51.446
the right sort of work
in the morning.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.913
It'll cost you a thousand.

27:54.915 --> 27:56.046
I don't think so.

27:56.048 --> 27:58.018
No, now that seems
entirely too high.

28:01.688 --> 28:04.822
Sir, I think we started
off on the wrong foot.

28:04.824 --> 28:08.659
I think a thousand
is actually fair.

28:08.661 --> 28:10.195
Now, is there a selection
of work you have...

28:10.197 --> 28:13.732
Attendants at
the hospital.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.966
And for a thousand, you can
throw in a pouch of tobacco.

28:15.968 --> 28:17.801
- And a notebook.
- A notebook?

28:17.803 --> 28:20.071
- I'm an artist.
- You're a forger.

28:20.073 --> 28:24.109
And you're a safecracker, a profession
of which I thoroughly disapprove.

28:24.111 --> 28:25.843
- At least I'm an honest criminal.
- Hmm.

28:25.845 --> 28:28.649
Hey. I'm gonna need that
right now.

28:29.315 --> 28:30.749
I mean, right now.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.119
Excuse me.

28:34.755 --> 28:38.793
I think you need to go
to the bathroom.

28:41.928 --> 28:43.698
Yes, of course.

28:44.765 --> 28:47.534
If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen.

28:51.071 --> 28:53.271
Where you goin'?

28:53.273 --> 28:55.076
I've never
been here before.

28:56.976 --> 28:59.146
Toilet's there,
princess.

29:07.353 --> 29:12.159
What animal but a man keeps his
only means of survival up his ass?

29:54.133 --> 29:56.169
Something bit me.

30:09.815 --> 30:12.082
We got a runner!

30:12.084 --> 30:15.086
- Lockdown!
- Lock it down!

30:15.088 --> 30:17.222
- Which barracks?
- No, he broke out the hospital.

30:17.224 --> 30:18.423
- Just one.
- The hospital?

30:18.425 --> 30:19.858
Lock down
your barrack.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.061
- I'll bet that's Julot.
- Lock it down!

30:23.063 --> 30:24.931
Son of a bitch
didn't waste any time.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.169
You see?

30:32.171 --> 30:33.972
It can be done.

30:33.974 --> 30:37.044
Lock it down! Into the jungle.
Stand down.

30:39.912 --> 30:41.314
Route Zero.

30:44.851 --> 30:45.986
Route Zero.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.823
Route Zero.

30:53.025 --> 30:56.061
My friend and I need to be
kept together at all times.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.730
Set these two up
in the hospital.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.999
And it'll be a few days before I'm
well enough to do any sort of...

31:01.001 --> 31:02.837
Don't push it.

31:04.103 --> 31:06.673
Both of them,
Route Zero.

31:09.176 --> 31:11.212
Mr. Dega, stop.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.483
I know you.
Do you know me?

31:18.485 --> 31:21.351
Yes.
Yes, of course, sir.

31:21.353 --> 31:23.253
You're the deputy
warden, sir.

31:23.255 --> 31:26.390
My sister's husband
was arrested

31:26.392 --> 31:29.829
selling counterfeit defense bonds you
furnished him with in Marseilles.

31:32.198 --> 31:35.466
Dega is a very common name
in Marseilles.

31:35.468 --> 31:38.035
- Santini.
- Yes, sir.

31:38.037 --> 31:40.738
This one goes straight
to Route Zero.

31:40.740 --> 31:42.142
Take him away.

31:42.876 --> 31:44.442
Wait.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.980
Take him too.

31:49.349 --> 31:51.983
We try not to separate
old friends here.

31:51.985 --> 31:54.688
Get them to Route Zero.
Move.

31:55.322 --> 31:57.757
What is Route Zero?

32:01.995 --> 32:03.863
Stand clear!

32:09.101 --> 32:10.970
Your other round!

32:13.172 --> 32:14.773
I don't feel so good.

32:14.775 --> 32:16.009
Watch it now!

32:19.178 --> 32:21.314
It go...
It goes in the cart.

32:23.883 --> 32:25.149
Move along.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.451
You do a lot
of talking.

32:26.453 --> 32:28.485
- I do?
- Yeah. Stop that.

32:28.487 --> 32:31.156
It passes...
It passes the time.

32:31.158 --> 32:34.094
- Get outta my face. Get outta my face.
- You take the bigger rock.

32:39.232 --> 32:42.803
You get into a fight with
him, I'm not protecting you.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.404
If your wife was here...

33:18.572 --> 33:21.207
you were in Paris
with all that money,

33:22.441 --> 33:24.878
how much would you pay
to get her back?

33:26.446 --> 33:28.349
Everything I have.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.355
How much would she pay
for you?

33:43.929 --> 33:45.900
You're a real optimist.

34:27.340 --> 34:31.178
Little man. Little man.
You need to put some weight in.

34:32.543 --> 34:34.945
You can push harder
than that. Come on.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.481
Trust me, he can't.

34:36.483 --> 34:39.483
Trust me,
he has to.

34:39.485 --> 34:41.321
Come on! Push it!

34:45.659 --> 34:47.561
- Push it!
- Pick up the pace.

34:50.063 --> 34:53.196
I have... I have diarrhea.

34:53.197 --> 34:55.264
What you want me
to do about it?

34:55.266 --> 34:57.301
No, you don't understand.

34:57.303 --> 35:00.240
I lost the money.

35:08.148 --> 35:11.349
What's the holdup?

35:11.351 --> 35:14.385
What the hell are you doing?

35:14.387 --> 35:16.720
- What?
- Stop shitting around.

35:16.722 --> 35:18.957
- You'll get us all killed.
- You mind your own cart.

35:18.959 --> 35:21.358
The little guy is making more
work for the rest of us.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.364
- Mind your own business.
- Break it up. Break it up.

35:26.398 --> 35:29.367
What are you doing?
Get up.

35:29.369 --> 35:31.505
Get up! Get up.

35:34.506 --> 35:36.341
- On your feet.
- I can't.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.209
Pick him up.

35:38.211 --> 35:40.014
Come on, pick him up.
Put him in the cart.

35:45.017 --> 35:47.318
Back to work.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.222
Move your carts.

36:01.668 --> 36:05.370
You had one job to do.
You couldn't do it.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.738
My body's in revolt.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.108
Where is it now?

36:10.410 --> 36:11.378
Where do you think?

36:15.247 --> 36:17.517
I should have known better
than to trust a thief.

36:22.454 --> 36:24.222
I can't steal
what's already mine.

36:28.160 --> 36:31.695
As soon as we get back to the
barracks, you're taking it back.

36:31.697 --> 36:33.296
And you're gonna hold onto
it this time.

36:33.298 --> 36:36.035
I don't care if you have
to sew your ass up to do it.

36:47.479 --> 36:49.315
I'm sorry.

36:51.651 --> 36:56.557
I may have prematurely judged you
with an unworthy degree of suspicion.

36:57.724 --> 36:59.791
Well, don't propose yet.

36:59.793 --> 37:01.528
I just don't like
carrying things in my ass.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.070
Mmm.

37:26.086 --> 37:27.785
He's dead.

37:27.787 --> 37:30.287
- He's dead!
- Shut up, birdie.

37:30.289 --> 37:32.726
Are you stupid or what?

37:34.593 --> 37:36.729
We share his ration.
Here.

37:42.836 --> 37:44.604
Here.

37:46.305 --> 37:49.075
So you got yourself a boyfriend, huh?

37:58.885 --> 38:00.754
You were in the navy?

38:03.456 --> 38:05.789
What do you think?

38:05.791 --> 38:07.627
I thought maybe
it meant "jailbird."

38:08.794 --> 38:12.497
Swallows.
It stands for hope.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.267
First thing you see
when you reach land.

38:15.300 --> 38:17.503
- I know.
- Yeah? How come?

38:18.872 --> 38:20.437
You were in the navy?

38:20.439 --> 38:22.874
Eighteen months.

38:22.876 --> 38:25.611
Followed by six in the brig.
Didn't suit me.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.780
A butterfly.

38:29.782 --> 38:32.416
So you're a thief now?

38:32.418 --> 38:34.655
Guess that didn't
suit you either.

38:43.896 --> 38:46.265
We should go sailing
sometime.

38:50.637 --> 38:52.539
You got a boat?

38:54.706 --> 38:57.341
Can you get any
of that?

38:57.343 --> 38:58.178
Maybe.

39:00.847 --> 39:02.282
Well, let me know then.

39:07.452 --> 39:10.287
Your boyfriend's
got trouble.

39:10.289 --> 39:12.289
Give me your money, or you
and your friend will die.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.260
- Is there trouble?
- I was talking to your bitch.

39:17.262 --> 39:18.662
Now you're talking to me.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.633
Work it out in the barracks!

39:23.635 --> 39:25.803
Break is over.

39:25.805 --> 39:27.841
Get in line!

39:29.541 --> 39:31.711
Break is over.
Forward march.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.515
Line it up.
Line it up!

39:40.419 --> 39:43.921
Stop. Stop!

39:43.923 --> 39:46.524
Turn around. Eyes up front.
Come on.

39:49.662 --> 39:53.363
You know better than to truck your
ladies through here after a rainstorm.

39:53.365 --> 39:56.733
Yeah.
Can you help me out?

39:56.735 --> 39:58.269
I'll make it good for you.

39:58.271 --> 40:00.671
Get the girls up here.

40:00.673 --> 40:01.608
Come on.

40:02.441 --> 40:03.941
Watch out.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.809
Watch out...

40:10.717 --> 40:12.619
Hey.

40:16.021 --> 40:17.724
Can you hear me?

40:19.626 --> 40:22.392
How much to take me
up the coast?

40:22.394 --> 40:24.361
Don't be stupid.

40:24.363 --> 40:26.400
I'll give you 2,000.

40:29.936 --> 40:31.269
Guard!

40:31.271 --> 40:33.637
Don't turn me in,
for Christ's sake.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.039
4,000.

40:36.041 --> 40:37.510
What's the problem?

40:39.311 --> 40:43.013
Just wanted to know which girl
I should send to repay you.

40:43.015 --> 40:45.519
One that hasn't
caught anything yet.

40:48.954 --> 40:53.024
My boat is on the other
side of the river.

40:53.026 --> 40:55.325
I'll be there for
three more days.

40:55.327 --> 40:56.929
It's 5,000.

40:57.896 --> 40:59.629
You're a goddamned thief.

42:53.979 --> 42:57.383
- The guards are coming.
- Don't fucking touch me!

43:40.760 --> 43:43.727
I didn't know
it would be like this.

43:43.729 --> 43:46.832
I'll be dead long before
my appeal.

43:50.135 --> 43:52.671
I need to go with you.

43:59.644 --> 44:01.678
That wasn't part
of the deal.

44:01.680 --> 44:05.718
Yes, I realize that, but I
still have to go with you.

44:11.791 --> 44:13.994
You ever sail a boat?

44:16.496 --> 44:18.965
Spend any time at sea?

44:22.101 --> 44:25.635
Yes, I have spent a
number of days at sea.

44:25.637 --> 44:27.740
I was locked in a cage
for most of them.

44:29.275 --> 44:33.109
But I think I understand
the concept well enough.

44:33.111 --> 44:35.144
You can't come
with me, Dega.

44:39.584 --> 44:41.887
You should call me Louis.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.901
Keep it moving.

44:57.836 --> 44:58.838
Get 'em in line.

45:01.974 --> 45:03.742
Stand straight!

45:11.316 --> 45:12.918
Down on your knees.

45:14.986 --> 45:17.957
Take off your hats
and cross your arms.

45:20.927 --> 45:25.932
At the moment of execution,
you're all to bow your heads.

45:43.849 --> 45:46.086
A man stabbed two guards...

45:47.852 --> 45:50.620
one of whom died this morning,

45:50.622 --> 45:53.959
leaving two children
without their father.

45:54.860 --> 45:56.827
And for what?

45:56.829 --> 45:59.195
So he could go on a run
through the jungle.

45:59.197 --> 46:01.734
Thank you
for coming!

46:03.702 --> 46:06.171
Watch me go to hell!

46:50.048 --> 46:51.617
Prisoner ready.

47:06.331 --> 47:10.169
Keeping you is no benefit.
Destroying you is no loss.

47:15.775 --> 47:17.274
You.

47:17.276 --> 47:18.645
Pick another inmate.

47:19.311 --> 47:21.648
You carry the body.

48:20.805 --> 48:23.774
Go get
the boat ready.

48:52.403 --> 48:54.273
He's gone.

48:56.307 --> 48:58.711
It's just
flesh and blood.

49:09.854 --> 49:12.256
Why are you stopping?

49:12.258 --> 49:13.957
What are you doing?

49:13.959 --> 49:15.729
Move.

49:17.930 --> 49:20.300
I said, what the hell
are you doing?

49:22.535 --> 49:24.104
Get up.

49:26.472 --> 49:30.276
You get up,
you little worm.

49:34.947 --> 49:36.345
Get your ass up.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.329
You little worm.

49:54.133 --> 49:55.135
Oh, shit.

49:56.168 --> 49:57.470
Oh, shit.

49:58.537 --> 50:00.939
Stop! Hey, stop!

50:10.515 --> 50:12.515
Hey!

50:12.517 --> 50:14.820
We've got a runner!

50:16.088 --> 50:18.555
He's heading north.

50:18.557 --> 50:19.622
Papi.

50:19.624 --> 50:22.291
- Papi?
- Heading north now!

50:22.293 --> 50:25.330
Papillon!

50:27.532 --> 50:29.968
Check the tree line.

50:56.195 --> 50:57.863
Hey!

51:34.265 --> 51:36.235
Pick him up.

51:37.669 --> 51:40.039
Come on. Come on.

52:00.626 --> 52:03.428
Oh. You're a good man.

52:07.131 --> 52:10.068
Yeah, I'm a good man
that wants his money.

52:12.704 --> 52:14.470
Look, I don't have it.

52:14.472 --> 52:16.673
Not with me.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.408
But I'm gonna make it
worth your while.

52:18.410 --> 52:20.209
I got a lot of money in Paris.

52:20.211 --> 52:22.948
I'll give you
everything I got.

52:26.485 --> 52:27.954
Hmm.

52:43.535 --> 52:46.436
Even if you had the money...

52:46.438 --> 52:49.071
the warden will pay us double.

52:49.073 --> 52:50.642
Son of a bitch.

53:27.311 --> 53:30.280
You're lucky
that guard didn't die.

53:30.282 --> 53:33.182
Otherwise, you would
have met the guillotine.

53:33.184 --> 53:36.620
Now you'll be transferred to
the island of Saint Joseph,

53:36.622 --> 53:40.727
where you'll serve a two-year
sentence in solitary confinement.

53:41.727 --> 53:44.160
There's no
rehabilitation.

53:44.162 --> 53:46.296
We know that's useless,

53:46.298 --> 53:48.735
so we do our best
to break you.

53:53.372 --> 53:55.575
Strange things
happen there.

53:57.242 --> 53:59.776
Especially to those
who cling to hope,

53:59.778 --> 54:02.611
because there is no hope
on Saint Joseph.

54:02.613 --> 54:04.349
Just silence.

54:20.131 --> 54:22.365
You heard the warden.

54:22.367 --> 54:25.204
Silence must be observed
at all times.

57:26.952 --> 57:29.322
Thought you grew wings,
didn't you?

57:33.925 --> 57:35.595
Grab him.

57:37.928 --> 57:39.361
I'll teach you to be quiet.

57:47.872 --> 57:49.541
You make another peep...

57:50.709 --> 57:53.279
you might not survive
your time here.

58:05.423 --> 58:06.825
Huh.

58:28.079 --> 58:30.482
Come on. He's crazy.
Come on. Come on.

58:33.485 --> 58:35.588
Enjoy your next
two years here.

01:00:52.756 --> 01:00:54.793
Dega.

01:02:06.965 --> 01:02:09.568
Hold on.
Need to check that.

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:17.673
What is that, hmm?

01:02:17.675 --> 01:02:20.175
Somebody paying you to bring this
shit in here? Son of a bitch.

01:02:20.177 --> 01:02:21.843
Huh? Who's paying you?

01:02:21.845 --> 01:02:23.680
Who's paying you, you son of a bitch?

01:02:25.749 --> 01:02:26.952
No!

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.254
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Whoa!

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:34.592
Jesus!
I think you killed him.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.928
Get that body out of
here and clean up the mess.

01:02:40.331 --> 01:02:42.233
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:03:02.887 --> 01:03:05.189
No wonder you haven't
broken yet.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.095
How long has it
being going on?

01:03:12.796 --> 01:03:14.867
You may speak.

01:03:18.235 --> 01:03:20.572
Who sent you
those coconuts?

01:03:32.217 --> 01:03:34.119
If you don't fess up...

01:03:35.653 --> 01:03:37.755
I'll put you on half rations.

01:03:41.825 --> 01:03:44.195
You're choosing another
man's life over your own.

01:04:01.012 --> 01:04:02.948
Put him on half rations.

01:06:10.374 --> 01:06:12.343
I brought you some soup.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.316
It's got meat in it.

01:06:39.938 --> 01:06:41.340
Just tell me his name.

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:52.818
Tell me his name.

01:07:20.477 --> 01:07:23.381
You think a person knows
when he's going mad?

01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:27.518
Or you think
it's blissful ignorance?

01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:30.822
'Cause you're about
to find out.

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:47.669
Put him in darkness for the
remainder of his sentence.

01:07:47.671 --> 01:07:49.405
Or the remainder of his life,

01:07:49.407 --> 01:07:51.043
whichever comes first.

01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:27.099
Six.

01:10:32.737 --> 01:10:33.705
Two.

01:10:39.811 --> 01:10:41.446
Twenty-four.

01:10:56.661 --> 01:10:58.196
6-2-24.

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.269
Twenty-four.

01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:29.227
This is a good escape.

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:36.128
Is he still alive?

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:40.732
Two years are up.

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:25.574
I know that some of
you, at this very moment,

01:13:25.576 --> 01:13:27.913
are thinking about escape.

01:13:29.246 --> 01:13:31.480
Feel free to try
whenever you like.

01:13:31.482 --> 01:13:33.785
We'll be happy
to shoot you.

01:13:35.318 --> 01:13:37.852
However, should you
avoid that mercy,

01:13:37.854 --> 01:13:41.856
there are two guardians
who are always on duty.

01:13:41.858 --> 01:13:45.526
The bush, where the best thing that
can happen to you is starvation.

01:13:45.528 --> 01:13:48.029
Or you could choose the sea,

01:13:48.031 --> 01:13:51.333
where the sharks too,
are always hungry.

01:13:54.705 --> 01:13:57.905
If you manage to
survive your first attempt,

01:13:57.907 --> 01:14:01.677
you'll get two years
in solitary.

01:14:01.679 --> 01:14:04.012
Second attempt is
five years in solitary,

01:14:04.014 --> 01:14:06.614
followed by a life sentence
at Devil's Island.

01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:12.288
If you commit murder...

01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:13.792
...you'll be executed.

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:17.329
That's all.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:24.869
Papi.

01:14:45.455 --> 01:14:47.922
I wanted to come sooner,

01:14:47.924 --> 01:14:50.829
but I was afraid you
wouldn't wanna see me.

01:14:57.601 --> 01:14:58.836
I'm sorry.

01:15:00.103 --> 01:15:01.972
It's my fault you're here.

01:15:09.013 --> 01:15:11.012
As you predicted, um,

01:15:11.014 --> 01:15:12.883
my appeal's run into
some problems.

01:15:14.617 --> 01:15:17.118
But my wife's doing very well.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.990
She recently married my lawyer.

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:28.767
Well, to hell with her then.

01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:35.570
You son of a bitch.

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:38.008
I thought you'd gone
simple on me.

01:15:42.412 --> 01:15:44.316
That's the idea.

01:15:52.822 --> 01:15:54.856
You know you'd have had
a much easier time

01:15:54.858 --> 01:15:57.126
if you'd just given them
my name.

01:15:57.128 --> 01:15:59.898
It's not like
I didn't think about it.

01:16:02.098 --> 01:16:04.565
I just know how goddamn
delicate you are.

01:16:04.567 --> 01:16:05.767
Mm.

01:16:09.706 --> 01:16:12.106
I fear under
similar circumstances

01:16:12.108 --> 01:16:14.044
I would've fared
differently.

01:16:15.812 --> 01:16:17.815
I don't know how you made it.

01:16:19.015 --> 01:16:21.719
I just got used to the silence.

01:16:23.653 --> 01:16:25.389
If I ever get out...

01:16:27.191 --> 01:16:29.794
I'm gonna live
a different kind of life.

01:16:34.197 --> 01:16:38.600
This Sunday, the warden will be
showing a film in the courtyard,

01:16:38.602 --> 01:16:40.935
entertaining some
local politicians.

01:16:40.937 --> 01:16:42.637
It'll be loud.

01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:45.574
The guards will be doing
double-duty, spread very thin.

01:16:45.576 --> 01:16:48.546
This is your best chance.

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.614
Can you get a boat?

01:16:52.616 --> 01:16:53.818
No.

01:16:55.753 --> 01:16:57.785
What about Celier?
Is he still here?

01:16:57.787 --> 01:16:59.557
Unfortunately, yes.

01:17:00.857 --> 01:17:02.826
If he can still get a boat...

01:17:05.196 --> 01:17:07.495
do you have enough money
to pay for it?

01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:10.567
Well, I might, but then
he'd wanna come with us.

01:17:12.102 --> 01:17:13.037
Us?

01:17:15.071 --> 01:17:16.106
Us.

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:21.513
All right.

01:17:23.013 --> 01:17:24.716
But we still need a boat.

01:17:26.549 --> 01:17:28.083
You leave now!

01:17:28.085 --> 01:17:29.650
Leave!

01:17:29.652 --> 01:17:31.520
Get out!

01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:33.625
Get out! Leave!

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.727
Get out!

01:17:36.693 --> 01:17:38.659
- This man's mad!
- Go!

01:17:38.661 --> 01:17:40.596
- Get out!
- He's out of his mind!

01:17:40.598 --> 01:17:42.663
No!
No, no, no, no!

01:17:42.665 --> 01:17:43.664
No!

01:17:43.666 --> 01:17:45.100
- No!
- He's out of his mind!

01:17:45.102 --> 01:17:47.069
Help me!
Help me!

01:17:47.071 --> 01:17:48.569
Come, Papi. Here.

01:17:48.571 --> 01:17:50.705
Come on, come... Calm down, calm down.
Let him go.

01:17:50.707 --> 01:17:52.641
Let him go!

01:17:52.643 --> 01:17:54.510
It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:54.512 --> 01:17:56.144
Shh, shh.

01:17:56.146 --> 01:17:57.812
Bring me some pills.

01:17:57.814 --> 01:17:59.248
Come on.
Take one.

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:00.819
Bring me some water.

01:18:02.519 --> 01:18:03.720
Swallow.

01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:09.027
It'll be okay.

01:18:23.773 --> 01:18:25.742
Lights out, ten minutes.

01:18:54.304 --> 01:18:56.171
Oh!

01:18:56.173 --> 01:18:57.672
Shh, shh.

01:18:57.674 --> 01:18:59.675
- Get off of me.
- Just relax!

01:18:59.677 --> 01:19:00.809
- Leave me!
- Relax.

01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:02.778
Get off! I will never
let you fuck me.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.879
Shh, shh.

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:09.554
You will soon, if you
know what's good for you.

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:27.802
Hey.

01:19:27.804 --> 01:19:29.706
Hey, I just wanna talk.

01:19:32.108 --> 01:19:35.177
- I'm not a goddamn whore.
- That's not what I want.

01:19:35.179 --> 01:19:37.178
Yeah, everybody says that
until they do.

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.780
Trust me, I don't.

01:19:39.782 --> 01:19:42.751
I got a different proposition.

01:19:42.753 --> 01:19:46.288
If you repeat one word of this,
it's not gonna be good for you.

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:48.660
- I don't wanna know then.
- Maybe you do.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:53.928
Look, I'm puttin'
something together.

01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:56.064
This Sunday.

01:19:56.066 --> 01:19:58.269
We got room for one more.

01:20:00.403 --> 01:20:02.370
I have nothing to offer you.

01:20:02.372 --> 01:20:04.909
I need you to distract
that turnkey.

01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:10.712
Get him to come in here at a
certain time, keep him occupied.

01:20:10.714 --> 01:20:12.216
If I do that,

01:20:13.282 --> 01:20:14.686
your plan better work.

01:20:15.753 --> 01:20:17.252
It'll work.

01:20:17.254 --> 01:20:19.287
It's not gonna be easy.

01:20:19.289 --> 01:20:21.593
Can you handle yourself?

01:20:24.061 --> 01:20:25.897
You were framed
for murder, right?

01:20:29.032 --> 01:20:30.968
Well, nobody framed me.

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.977
That's Celier.

01:20:40.143 --> 01:20:41.943
He's gotten us a boat.

01:20:41.945 --> 01:20:43.377
Let's see the arm.

01:20:43.379 --> 01:20:44.881
Infected.

01:20:48.285 --> 01:20:49.720
Good job.

01:20:51.021 --> 01:20:52.887
Papi!

01:20:52.889 --> 01:20:54.659
You skinny son of a bitch.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.391
Good to see you.

01:20:57.393 --> 01:20:59.427
What'd you do
to your arm?

01:20:59.429 --> 01:21:01.762
I had to cut myself
to get in here.

01:21:01.764 --> 01:21:04.099
- It still work?
- Yeah, it's nothing. Don't think about it.

01:21:04.101 --> 01:21:07.368
- I can still kick your ass.
- Can we hurry this up? I have to get back.

01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:08.972
Birdie, can you
shut up for once?

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.306
This is Maturette.
He's our fourth.

01:21:12.308 --> 01:21:15.177
Oh, yeah?

01:21:15.179 --> 01:21:17.712
- You know how to handle yourself?
- Yeah, with a knife.

01:21:17.714 --> 01:21:20.716
- All right, take it easy.
- Feisty little one, huh?

01:21:22.251 --> 01:21:25.753
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm set.

01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:27.955
I got a guy that's
hiding a boat on the bank.

01:21:27.957 --> 01:21:30.492
It's upriver a ways.

01:21:30.494 --> 01:21:33.231
From there, it's a straight
shot to the ocean.

01:21:35.232 --> 01:21:37.135
But we need
half the money now.

01:21:39.469 --> 01:21:41.235
What about you?

01:21:41.237 --> 01:21:43.771
When the film starts, we'll go
through the warden's building.

01:21:43.773 --> 01:21:44.709
I'll have a key.

01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:49.110
We got a plan.

01:21:49.112 --> 01:21:50.380
We got a plan.

01:21:58.755 --> 01:21:59.956
You all right?

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:02.457
No.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:06.127
I'm not sure
we can trust him.

01:22:06.129 --> 01:22:08.363
Look at him,
he's unpredictable.

01:22:08.365 --> 01:22:09.998
He's like a caged animal.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.467
We're all animals
in here, pal.

01:22:15.205 --> 01:22:16.441
He'll be fine.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.276
He needs the money now.

01:22:32.188 --> 01:22:33.488
Here.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:36.224
It's the sedatives
they gave me.

01:22:36.226 --> 01:22:38.560
Get 'em in the guards' coffee.

01:22:38.562 --> 01:22:40.298
We'll do the rest.

01:22:42.432 --> 01:22:44.332
I have to get back.

01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:45.803
Hey.

01:22:48.304 --> 01:22:50.006
You're doin' good.

01:23:04.554 --> 01:23:06.587
- Hey.
- What do we have here, huh?

01:23:06.589 --> 01:23:08.025
Go to hell.

01:23:09.459 --> 01:23:11.860
Give me those back.

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:13.060
He's gonna fuck up
our plan.

01:23:13.062 --> 01:23:14.995
It's gonna be fine.

01:23:16.967 --> 01:23:19.400
What the fuck are you doing, man?

01:23:26.143 --> 01:23:27.943
All right!
That's enough!

01:23:27.945 --> 01:23:29.947
Break it up!
Break it up!

01:23:32.081 --> 01:23:33.280
He does the warden's books.

01:23:44.527 --> 01:23:46.895
I had to figure I'd know
how to throw a punch

01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:49.433
considering how often
my father used to beat me.

01:23:53.937 --> 01:23:55.139
Yours too?

01:23:56.473 --> 01:23:58.810
My parents are school teachers.

01:24:02.979 --> 01:24:04.247
See ya tonight.

01:24:16.425 --> 01:24:17.527
Anisette for the warden.

01:24:18.495 --> 01:24:19.863
The best you have.

01:24:22.299 --> 01:24:24.001
Just give me the bottle.

01:25:40.744 --> 01:25:43.278
Here's two or three.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.080
Would you gentlemen
like your coffees freshened?

01:25:46.082 --> 01:25:47.218
Bring it on in.

01:26:04.401 --> 01:26:06.400
Compliments of the warden.

01:26:06.402 --> 01:26:08.203
Wow.

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:09.503
Very nice.

01:26:15.411 --> 01:26:16.579
Here.

01:26:21.485 --> 01:26:24.655
If we kill someone and this goes
wrong, it's the guillotine.

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:27.124
No one dies.

01:26:52.348 --> 01:26:54.149
Give me another one
of them.

01:26:54.151 --> 01:26:55.519
All right.

01:27:11.835 --> 01:27:13.168
Dega!

01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:15.102
Where are you going?

01:27:15.104 --> 01:27:16.404
Dega!

01:27:16.406 --> 01:27:18.175
The warden.
Now!

01:27:53.610 --> 01:27:55.310
Stop!
Shh, shh!

01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:56.444
Shh, shh!

01:27:56.446 --> 01:27:58.613
What was that?

01:27:58.615 --> 01:28:00.217
I'd better go check.

01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:25.276
It's working.

01:28:47.731 --> 01:28:50.265
Oh, man.

01:28:50.267 --> 01:28:52.135
We're too early.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:55.669
Hey, got a light?

01:28:55.671 --> 01:28:57.372
Yes, of course, sir.

01:29:07.884 --> 01:29:10.318
Oh! Oh!
Okay, go inside.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.686
Everybody, go inside.
Come on.

01:29:12.688 --> 01:29:14.325
- Come on, darling.
- Fuck.

01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:17.862
- That's our way out.
- No, no.

01:29:25.568 --> 01:29:27.267
What's he doin'?

01:29:31.674 --> 01:29:32.974
- Power's off!
- Fuck!

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.681
Papi, we gotta move.
We can't stay here.

01:29:40.683 --> 01:29:42.984
We wait for Dega.

01:29:42.986 --> 01:29:45.252
Forget about Dega!

01:29:45.254 --> 01:29:46.988
He's not reliable.

01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:48.655
And you know it!

01:29:48.657 --> 01:29:51.226
Let's just go.
Come on.

01:29:51.228 --> 01:29:52.961
You wanna go?

01:29:52.963 --> 01:29:54.331
Go.

01:29:56.232 --> 01:29:57.267
You with me?

01:29:58.634 --> 01:30:00.436
Uh, yeah.
Open the gate.

01:30:01.504 --> 01:30:02.740
What's wrong with you?

01:30:08.644 --> 01:30:12.680
Ha! I stole the keys to get
us up to the central walkway.

01:30:12.682 --> 01:30:15.249
We can take that
to the guard tower.

01:30:15.251 --> 01:30:18.720
As long as the lights stay off,
they won't see us.

01:30:18.722 --> 01:30:20.555
And then we jump?

01:30:20.557 --> 01:30:22.193
You got a better idea?

01:30:30.299 --> 01:30:31.332
Come on.

01:30:31.334 --> 01:30:32.570
Come on!

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:38.675
Go, go!

01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:45.381
Guard the wall!

01:30:46.715 --> 01:30:48.483
You! Take me
to the south wall.

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:50.485
Yes, sir!

01:31:08.504 --> 01:31:09.604
Oh, shit.

01:31:09.606 --> 01:31:11.342
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

01:31:12.675 --> 01:31:13.943
Easy.

01:31:20.983 --> 01:31:23.083
You all right?

01:31:23.085 --> 01:31:24.918
Let's go!
Come on!

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.456
Go, go, go.

01:31:45.075 --> 01:31:46.577
Come on!

01:31:47.710 --> 01:31:48.611
Jump!

01:31:49.745 --> 01:31:50.980
Come on!

01:31:55.018 --> 01:31:56.950
Come on!
Come on!

01:31:56.952 --> 01:31:58.656
They're gonna see you!
Come on!

01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:03.658
Come on!

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:05.360
Jump!
Come on!

01:32:05.362 --> 01:32:08.562
Jump!

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:10.698
Shit!

01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.932
Hey.
It's broken.

01:32:11.934 --> 01:32:13.967
- Leave him.
- He's got the money.

01:32:13.969 --> 01:32:15.669
Aah.

01:32:15.671 --> 01:32:17.040
Maturette, help me.

01:32:18.375 --> 01:32:19.606
Christ!

01:32:19.608 --> 01:32:21.378
All right, come on.

01:32:22.946 --> 01:32:23.881
Let's go.

01:32:34.156 --> 01:32:35.525
Come on.

01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:42.396
How much further
to the boat?

01:32:42.398 --> 01:32:43.931
You're slowing us down,
Dega.

01:32:43.933 --> 01:32:46.770
Come on.
We've got to move faster.

01:33:13.429 --> 01:33:15.798
Don't take another step.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.535
You're not takin' me back.

01:33:20.937 --> 01:33:23.573
That depends
if you have my money.

01:33:28.577 --> 01:33:29.646
Hey.

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:32.547
Papi.
It's okay.

01:33:32.549 --> 01:33:34.017
This is my guy
with the boat.

01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:41.655
Where's our boat?

01:33:41.657 --> 01:33:43.858
It's a ways up the river.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:46.726
Want me to take you
there, pay me.

01:33:46.728 --> 01:33:47.830
Or fuck you.

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:04.448
This is all I have left.

01:34:09.885 --> 01:34:11.988
Let's keep that between us.

01:34:33.843 --> 01:34:35.512
Enjoy your freedom!

01:35:23.058 --> 01:35:25.760
Fuck! What kind of
shit boat did you get us?

01:35:25.762 --> 01:35:27.761
Shut up, Dega!

01:35:27.763 --> 01:35:30.230
You're lucky to be here.
Keep bailing!

01:35:30.232 --> 01:35:31.932
Get it outta the boat.

01:35:31.934 --> 01:35:34.235
I'm trying.

01:35:34.237 --> 01:35:36.270
Don't throw it at me, Dega.
Goddamn it.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:38.172
- Throw it in the water!
- I'm throwing it at the water.

01:35:38.174 --> 01:35:39.907
- Maturette!
- Yes?

01:35:39.909 --> 01:35:40.811
Check the tiller.

01:35:42.879 --> 01:35:44.147
I got it,
I got it.

01:35:49.117 --> 01:35:50.784
Papi.

01:35:50.786 --> 01:35:53.119
This boat can't hold all of us.
You know it.

01:35:53.121 --> 01:35:54.691
We need to lighten
the weight.

01:36:01.863 --> 01:36:04.065
He's gonna die anyway, Papi.

01:36:04.067 --> 01:36:05.865
Nobody needs to die.

01:36:05.867 --> 01:36:08.101
Fuck!
It fell off!

01:36:08.103 --> 01:36:09.971
- Fix the tiller!
- It's broken.

01:36:09.973 --> 01:36:11.174
Fix the tiller!

01:36:12.174 --> 01:36:13.807
Move!

01:36:21.784 --> 01:36:22.986
Come on.

01:36:57.754 --> 01:37:00.387
Here, take this.
Take this.

01:37:00.389 --> 01:37:01.791
Maturette, help me.

01:37:16.839 --> 01:37:19.273
This storm is
gonna sink the boat.

01:37:19.275 --> 01:37:21.441
We need to act,
and we need to act now.

01:37:21.443 --> 01:37:22.979
Just let me get
the boat ready.

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.183
Did you lose your mind?
Huh?

01:37:27.316 --> 01:37:29.249
You wanna die
because of this guy?

01:37:29.251 --> 01:37:31.321
Nobody needs to die.

01:37:36.092 --> 01:37:37.227
Well, we can't all live.

01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:41.028
Dega, he's dead weight.

01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:42.799
How much money you have?

01:37:45.367 --> 01:37:47.435
He doesn't have any money.

01:37:47.437 --> 01:37:49.436
He doesn't have any money?

01:37:49.438 --> 01:37:51.337
You hear that, Maturette?

01:37:51.339 --> 01:37:52.909
They've been lying to us.

01:37:54.443 --> 01:37:55.911
You wanna die for him?

01:37:58.915 --> 01:38:00.413
That makes it
two against one, Papi.

01:38:00.415 --> 01:38:01.981
Step aside.

01:38:01.983 --> 01:38:03.851
You don't need to do anything.

01:38:03.853 --> 01:38:05.985
Step aside, Papi!

01:38:05.987 --> 01:38:07.223
I'm not gonna die
for that guy.

01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:10.927
Last chance, Papi.
Step aside!

01:38:13.228 --> 01:38:15.197
I don't know about you,
I'm going home!

01:39:10.253 --> 01:39:11.385
Stop!

01:39:11.387 --> 01:39:13.186
Stop!

01:39:13.188 --> 01:39:15.057
Enough!
That's enough!

01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:17.894
That's enough.

01:39:20.495 --> 01:39:21.561
Enough.

01:41:43.505 --> 01:41:45.040
Welcome.

01:41:50.412 --> 01:41:52.312
I was traveling
with two other men.

01:41:52.314 --> 01:41:54.183
They are
being cared for.

01:41:59.187 --> 01:42:01.055
Where are we?

01:42:01.057 --> 01:42:03.193
This is Colombia.

01:42:06.195 --> 01:42:07.597
We know where
you've come from.

01:42:11.099 --> 01:42:13.436
But you need only repent.

01:42:14.536 --> 01:42:17.973
Allow God back
into your life...

01:42:19.607 --> 01:42:21.644
and you'll be forgiven.

01:42:24.013 --> 01:42:26.046
You should go
and wash yourself.

01:42:26.048 --> 01:42:28.485
Then come
and pray with us.

01:43:52.067 --> 01:43:53.736
We need to keep movin'.

01:43:59.575 --> 01:44:01.344
They know
where we came from.

01:44:04.146 --> 01:44:06.215
Our deal is done.

01:44:07.715 --> 01:44:10.452
I told you
we couldn't trust him.

01:44:14.557 --> 01:44:16.291
I'm leaving.

01:44:19.161 --> 01:44:21.064
With or without you.

01:44:39.581 --> 01:44:41.050
Good luck.

01:44:53.262 --> 01:44:55.428
Papi!
We made it!

01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:57.163
Papi.

01:44:57.165 --> 01:44:58.664
It's paradise here.

01:44:58.666 --> 01:45:00.335
Yeah, but it's not home.

01:45:02.338 --> 01:45:03.706
Not for me, anyway.

01:45:06.174 --> 01:45:07.509
Good luck, Maturette.

01:46:19.814 --> 01:46:21.317
We're leaving.

01:46:22.483 --> 01:46:23.816
Now.

01:46:23.818 --> 01:46:25.722
Come on.

01:46:27.388 --> 01:46:28.821
- Aah!
- Papi!

01:46:28.823 --> 01:46:30.425
Maturette!

01:46:40.835 --> 01:46:42.468
Repent.

01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:44.503
If you are truly sorry
for what you have done,

01:46:44.505 --> 01:46:46.273
then you have
nothing to fear.

01:46:46.275 --> 01:46:48.244
God will watch over you.

01:46:56.352 --> 01:46:57.887
You came back.

01:47:32.321 --> 01:47:33.756
Come on, Papi.

01:47:59.982 --> 01:48:02.285
I had to come
and see this for myself.

01:48:03.719 --> 01:48:05.955
Few men survive
five years in solitary.

01:48:13.829 --> 01:48:15.598
What were you
living for?

01:48:18.599 --> 01:48:20.969
'Cause I don't think you're gonna
find it where you're going...

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.309
Devil's Island.

01:50:33.134 --> 01:50:37.439
Now, what's the son of two school
teachers doing in a place like this?

01:51:15.978 --> 01:51:17.146
Well?

01:51:18.981 --> 01:51:20.182
What do you think?

01:51:24.052 --> 01:51:26.022
I've had five years
to work on it.

01:51:27.723 --> 01:51:31.591
The warden wasn't very happy
with my disobedience.

01:51:31.593 --> 01:51:35.194
So he sent me straight here
to Devil's Island.

01:51:50.646 --> 01:51:52.682
Let's get some food in you.

01:52:09.697 --> 01:52:11.200
Rise and shine.

01:52:13.835 --> 01:52:14.770
Come on.

01:52:16.004 --> 01:52:18.107
There's work to be done.

01:53:29.745 --> 01:53:31.613
Can we get to the ocean?

01:53:41.389 --> 01:53:42.959
I know what you're thinking.

01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:47.597
But even if you survive
the fall...

01:53:49.731 --> 01:53:51.634
you'll never survive
the ocean.

01:55:05.973 --> 01:55:07.106
Hmm?

01:55:07.108 --> 01:55:09.175
It's all about the waves.

01:55:09.177 --> 01:55:11.110
What?

01:55:11.112 --> 01:55:12.912
What are you talking about?

01:55:12.914 --> 01:55:15.315
What do you think
I'm talkin' about?

01:55:15.317 --> 01:55:17.117
Oh, go back to bed.

01:55:17.119 --> 01:55:18.517
That's suicide, not escape.

01:55:18.519 --> 01:55:20.787
No. Listen.

01:55:20.789 --> 01:55:24.257
All we need to do is build a
raft and get it to the ocean.

01:55:24.259 --> 01:55:27.029
The tide will take us
straight to the mainland.

01:55:30.232 --> 01:55:32.398
Just come and see.

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.736
Come and see!

01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:55.020
See?

01:55:55.022 --> 01:55:56.791
We ride the current
to freedom.

01:58:13.161 --> 01:58:16.695
I'm a little concerned about your
ability to protect me right now.

01:58:16.697 --> 01:58:19.198
Don't worry. The fall
will probably kill us.

01:58:23.338 --> 01:58:25.040
Let's tie these together.

01:58:37.251 --> 01:58:38.620
I need to stay.

01:58:46.728 --> 01:58:48.597
What are you talking about?

01:58:53.134 --> 01:58:54.937
I need to stay.

01:58:56.705 --> 01:58:59.441
For the same reason
you have to go.

01:59:01.576 --> 01:59:03.212
I belong here.

01:59:09.150 --> 01:59:10.352
It's okay.

01:59:14.054 --> 01:59:15.223
It's good.

01:59:49.156 --> 01:59:51.259
Go on now. You don't wanna
waste any more time.

02:01:44.505 --> 02:01:46.374
Louis!

02:01:48.710 --> 02:01:50.379
Louis!

02:01:53.147 --> 02:01:55.083
Louis!

02:01:57.684 --> 02:02:00.822
I made it,
you dirty little forger!

02:02:03.825 --> 02:02:05.458
Whoo!

02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:07.426
Whoo-hoo!

02:02:10.631 --> 02:02:12.800
Whoo!

02:03:08.923 --> 02:03:10.459
Thank you.

02:03:14.762 --> 02:03:15.860
Sir?

02:03:15.862 --> 02:03:17.331
Your water.

02:03:18.866 --> 02:03:20.736
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:03:27.008 --> 02:03:29.809
<i>I'm surprised
you risked coming back.</i>

02:03:29.811 --> 02:03:32.845
I'd read
the statute of limitations.

02:03:32.847 --> 02:03:34.349
You're still a wanted man.

02:03:35.383 --> 02:03:36.785
I won't be here long.

02:03:38.987 --> 02:03:40.889
My home is Venezuela now.

02:03:42.656 --> 02:03:46.258
But it's important

02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:48.229
that my memoir
be published here...

02:03:49.464 --> 02:03:50.832
in France.

02:04:17.592 --> 02:04:20.429
My wife convinced me
to write it all down...

02:04:22.330 --> 02:04:24.533
while I'm still young enough
to remember.

02:04:29.403 --> 02:04:31.406
So is this really your story?

02:04:39.813 --> 02:04:41.682
It's the story of
a lot of men.
