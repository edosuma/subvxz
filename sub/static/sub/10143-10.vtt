Step aside, Major.

00:16.621 --> 00:18.789
We'd all understand if
you pulled that trigger.

00:20.458 --> 00:24.028
But the lives of thousands
of people are at stake.

00:42.519 --> 00:44.020
Hmm...

00:44.055 --> 00:45.489
Secure him.

00:48.393 --> 00:50.061
Dress his wounds.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.111
<i>John Porter...</i>

01:14.322 --> 01:15.556
<i>Blood.</i>

01:20.695 --> 01:21.895
Sit forward.

01:25.767 --> 01:27.934
Enjoy your stay
at the organ farm?

01:27.969 --> 01:30.104
Actually, I thought
the food was shit.

01:30.138 --> 01:31.806
So I discharged myself.

01:34.277 --> 01:36.278
We're secure!

01:36.312 --> 01:38.848
Careful.

01:41.552 --> 01:43.153
He's clean.

01:46.691 --> 01:49.660
Sergeant Richmond...

01:49.694 --> 01:54.865
All your training to do
this...woman's work.

02:05.211 --> 02:08.113
Sergeant. We have
a hit! Target 2.

02:08.148 --> 02:09.247
Purchasing train ticket.

02:09.282 --> 02:11.150
Where?

02:11.184 --> 02:12.384
Big screen.

02:14.154 --> 02:16.522
Kobanya Station,
south-east suburb.

02:16.556 --> 02:17.923
<i>Satellite lock on Kobanya.</i>

02:17.958 --> 02:19.391
Target's carrying a case.

02:19.426 --> 02:22.528
Right, he's on the train.
Where's it going?

02:22.562 --> 02:25.798
Arrives Nyugati Main
Station in 12 minutes.

02:25.832 --> 02:27.700
If there is a bomb
in that case...

02:27.734 --> 02:30.069
He'll need a trigger mechanism.
Something like a cell phone.

02:30.103 --> 02:32.538
Remember we're
dealing with VX.

02:32.572 --> 02:34.006
You will shoot
to kill.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.774
Copy that.
Yes, Ma'am.

02:39.445 --> 02:41.446
Is it just me?
What?

02:41.481 --> 02:43.415
Sinclair.

02:43.450 --> 02:45.128
You gotta wonder about
a guy that's gonna step

02:45.153 --> 02:46.553

Buda Palace as behind me, more

04:50.705 --> 04:52.539
Now, although

Nothing yet. Whatever
transport he's using,

05:40.622 --> 05:42.079

05:42.104 --> 05:44.892
they understand the need

05:44.960 --> 05:46.249
Yes, sir. A discrete meeting

05:46.274 --> 05:48.416
room has been arranged
just as you requested.

05:48.464 --> 05:49.664
Good.

05:59.907 --> 06:01.507
About time, Colonel.

06:08.683 --> 06:10.851
Recognize it?

06:10.885 --> 06:13.521
Should I be invoking
my human rights?

06:13.555 --> 06:16.725
Oh, for that you
need to be human.

06:16.759 --> 06:20.196

what you are?

06:26.404 --> 06:28.738
You know better
than anyone, Colonel.

06:28.773 --> 06:30.974
How many deaths
have you sanctioned?

06:31.008 --> 06:32.209
Hmm...

06:33.911 --> 06:37.081
As you can see, we're
tracking your bomber.

06:37.115 --> 06:39.888
We have face recognition
software on every CCTV

06:39.913 --> 06:41.479
camera in this city.

06:43.622 --> 06:44.722
Impressive.

06:44.757 --> 06:48.259
He will be caught, and
he will be neutralized.

06:50.396 --> 06:52.123
But if you thought there
was only one, you would

06:52.148 --> 06:53.348
have killed me already...

07:11.584 --> 07:13.384
<i>Target has disembarked.</i>

07:13.419 --> 07:14.586
We have visual!

Target getting of train
at Nyugati Station.

07:18.190 --> 07:19.343
<i>Yeah, copy that. We're</i>

07:19.368 --> 07:20.568
<i>approaching the station now.</i>

07:36.276 --> 07:37.643
See anything?

07:43.317 --> 07:44.617
We've got no visual.

07:44.652 --> 07:46.986
<i>Repeat, no visual.</i>

07:48.956 --> 07:52.525
Found him. Target's
boarding a westbound subway.

07:52.559 --> 07:55.188
It's rush hour... If he
detonates down there, he could

07:55.213 --> 07:56.361
kill thousands of people.

07:56.362 --> 07:58.730
He's heading under
the river.

07:58.764 --> 08:00.398
You need to
intercept further down the line!

08:00.432 --> 08:01.732
<i>Copy that.</i>

08:08.373 --> 08:09.907
We have no visual.

08:09.942 --> 08:11.709
<i>Target</i>
<i>still on train, next stop...</i>

08:26.993 --> 08:29.327
You're thinking about
Delhi, aren't you?

08:31.230 --> 08:32.630
When we shook hands...

08:36.268 --> 08:38.202
And you gave
me Mahmood.

08:39.703 --> 08:42.072
You must long for
that moment again.

08:47.344 --> 08:49.545
It would have saved a life.

08:49.580 --> 08:51.314
She had forfeited her life.

08:52.983 --> 08:55.552
And what about
Sergeant John Porter?

08:55.586 --> 08:58.154
Captain Kate
Marshall...

08:58.189 --> 09:01.591
Are they just pawns
in your game?

09:01.626 --> 09:04.761
Pawns that you pushed into
the center of the board.

09:05.830 --> 09:07.731
This will end today.

09:09.033 --> 09:12.636
Finally, something
we can agree on.

09:14.039 --> 09:16.273
Target's off.
Batthyany Station!

09:16.308 --> 09:18.242
<i>Yeah, copy</i>
<i>that. We're en route.</i>

09:36.693 --> 09:38.427
Going down. Go...

10:05.556 --> 10:08.157
<i>I think</i>
<i>I got a visual on target.</i>

10:08.191 --> 10:10.726
<i>Looks like he's coming</i>
<i>up river side exit.</i>

10:19.701 --> 10:22.068
Target visual.
In pursuit.

11:23.264 --> 11:26.098
If you get a
headshot, take it!

11:26.133 --> 11:28.267
Negative. I've got
no clear shot.

11:28.301 --> 11:30.803
It's a fucking
sardine can in here.

11:37.877 --> 11:39.377
Where's that tram heading?

11:39.412 --> 11:42.113
Due south, towards
the palace.

11:42.148 --> 11:45.183
Moving closer, I
might have a chance.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.822
Excuse me, coming
through. Excuse me.

11:55.962 --> 11:58.163
Hey, hey, hey. Shh...
Calm down. Calm down.

11:58.197 --> 11:59.698
Fuck off! Fuck off.

11:59.732 --> 12:01.633
Move, move, move!
Get the fuck back!

12:01.667 --> 12:03.569
Sorry,
move out of the way...

12:03.603 --> 12:04.937
Get the fuck
out of my way!

12:04.971 --> 12:07.906
He's got a phone!
Drop it! Drop it!

12:07.941 --> 12:09.374
Shut the fuck up!

12:14.681 --> 12:18.184
Move, move, move, move!

12:18.218 --> 12:20.487

Got it, got it, got it!

12:20.521 --> 12:22.689
Move, move, get off!

12:24.758 --> 12:25.892
Gimme the fucking phone!

12:25.926 --> 12:28.061
What's happening?

12:28.095 --> 12:30.029
Scott, Stonebridge, report.

12:30.064 --> 12:31.464
I think he's armed it! Fuck!

12:31.498 --> 12:32.698
Oh, shit!

12:33.734 --> 12:37.370
Fuck... Get the fuck up!

12:37.404 --> 12:39.806
You fucker. Stay
there. Stay there.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.009
Everyone get off
the tram, bomb!

12:43.043 --> 12:44.744
<i>I'm</i>
<i>opening the briefcase.</i>

12:47.381 --> 12:49.249
How you doing, Mike?

12:54.121 --> 12:55.855
It's fucking empty!

12:55.890 --> 12:57.408
Where's the fucking bomb?
Where's the fucking bomb?

12:59.193 --> 13:02.162
Show me, where's
the fucking bomb?

13:02.196 --> 13:05.064
Huh, where's...
Where is it?

13:05.099 --> 13:08.868
What the fuck is that?

13:08.902 --> 13:11.070
Jesus, the bomb's in him!

13:11.105 --> 13:12.705
It's in him. It's in him!
Get off the tram! Move, Scott!

13:12.740 --> 13:15.608
Shut the doors, move!
Get out, Scott!

13:15.642 --> 13:17.510
Move, move back!
Move away!

13:17.544 --> 13:20.512
Everyone get back!

13:20.547 --> 13:23.749
Everyone back! Move back!

13:25.352 --> 13:27.153
- Now!
- Move!

13:29.423 --> 13:30.690
Shit!

13:30.725 --> 13:32.325
Back up! Back
the fuck up!

13:33.361 --> 13:34.528
Scott! Scott!

13:34.562 --> 13:35.796
Everyone back!

13:35.831 --> 13:37.065
Lady,
back, back! Move!

13:37.099 --> 13:38.166
Get away from the tram!

13:38.200 --> 13:40.468
Get away from here!

13:46.509 --> 13:47.709
Scott, report.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.244
Get on the police...

13:49.278 --> 13:51.346
You're gonna need decontamination units,
hazmat suits, the works.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.680
Is he using the VX?

13:52.714 --> 13:55.149
Yeah. It's nasty shit.

13:55.183 --> 13:56.283
<i>And you're okay?</i>

13:56.318 --> 13:58.319
Yeah,
thanks for asking.

13:58.353 --> 14:00.692
<i>Explosion was contained</i>
<i>within the tram. No civilian</i>

14:00.717 --> 14:02.217
<i>casualties that I know of...</i>

14:02.256 --> 14:03.523
<i>That shit is leaking out.</i>

14:03.558 --> 14:05.158
<i>Hey, back up!</i>
<i>Back up!</i>

14:05.193 --> 14:06.459
Are you at a
safe distance?

14:06.494 --> 14:07.761
Affirmative,
we're upwind.

14:07.796 --> 14:09.698
This area needs
to be sealed off.

14:09.732 --> 14:12.167
<i>All right, Mike, looks like</i>
<i>the cavalry's here. Let's go.</i>

14:12.201 --> 14:14.537
Scott. Can you confirm how
the device was detonated?

14:14.571 --> 14:16.739
You really
want to know?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.841
It was inside
the son of a bitch.

14:18.876 --> 14:20.743
Alert the Hungarians. Let them
know what we're dealing with.

14:20.778 --> 14:21.651
Got it.

14:21.676 --> 14:23.142
There's no keeping
a lid on this now...

14:23.381 --> 14:25.915
We need to find that other
bomber. And fucking quick.

15:21.207 --> 15:22.373
Colonel.

15:28.181 --> 15:30.682
The bomber triggered a
device onboard a tram.

15:30.717 --> 15:32.973
Scott and Stonebridge managed
to get everyone clear, and

15:32.998 --> 15:34.610
contain most of the blast.

15:34.955 --> 15:39.726
The device was carried
inside the bomber's body.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.763
It's been a potential
terrorist M.O. for awhile now.

15:42.797 --> 15:45.299
A bomb in a cavity created by
the removal of the spleen.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.428
It seems Major Sinclair
appreciates the measure

15:47.453 --> 15:48.653
of my achievement.

15:48.970 --> 15:50.170
It's an obscenity.

15:50.204 --> 15:52.539
Then it is just one of many.

15:52.573 --> 15:54.474
Thank you, Major.
Colonel.

15:59.780 --> 16:01.381
<i>We've</i>
<i>just received a report...</i>

16:01.415 --> 16:04.550
<i>That there's been a large</i>
<i>explosion in the city.</i>

16:04.585 --> 16:07.497
Now, we're all the way up
here at the Buda Palace, and

16:07.522 --> 16:09.640
we heard a really loud bang.

16:09.656 --> 16:12.236
There is still no
indication as to what has

16:12.261 --> 16:14.190
caused that explosion.
But as you can see

16:14.191 --> 16:17.038
behind me, the riot police
have been drafted in.

16:17.098 --> 16:20.350
And they were quite calm, but
now they are starting to get

16:20.375 --> 16:22.194
very, very anxious indeed.

16:27.075 --> 16:30.008
Exposing innocent people
to this poisonous,

16:30.033 --> 16:31.896
meaningless slaughter.

16:31.981 --> 16:33.682
I'm not a nihilist, Colonel.

16:33.716 --> 16:36.151
Everything I do has a purpose.

16:37.453 --> 16:38.987
And what is that purpose?

16:44.294 --> 16:46.261
If word of my
presence here gets out,

16:46.296 --> 16:48.828
our enemies at home,
will undermine my

16:48.853 --> 16:50.425
presidential campaign.

16:50.766 --> 16:53.234
And with it our
chances for peace.

16:56.938 --> 16:59.274
Yes.

16:59.299 --> 17:00.968
I'm sorry, sir, we
have to go turn around.

17:01.008 --> 17:02.208
Why?

17:04.178 --> 17:06.546
We've been given
a new location.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.948
Well, what is happening?

17:07.982 --> 17:10.184
Some incident
at the Summit.

17:10.218 --> 17:12.019
Incident?

17:28.671 --> 17:29.871
Please!

17:32.307 --> 17:34.475
So what are you
hoping to achieve?

17:34.509 --> 17:36.776
Becoming the poster boy
for Islamist Jihad?

17:36.811 --> 17:39.079
A new bin Laden?
Oh, please...

17:39.113 --> 17:42.015
You insult me by comparing me
to these religious fanatics.

17:42.050 --> 17:44.484
Oh, and you're not?
I'm a pragmatist.

17:44.519 --> 17:47.220
A Pakistani patriot.
You disgrace your country.

17:47.255 --> 17:50.357
I honor my country,
as I always have.

17:50.391 --> 17:54.962
I have no regrets.
Can you say the same?

17:58.901 --> 18:01.804
I am not going
to let this happen.

18:01.838 --> 18:04.841
My will is greater
than yours.

18:07.277 --> 18:10.279
Then you know
nothing of my will.

18:10.313 --> 18:13.014
Mr. Laszlo, this
is Major Sinclair.

18:13.049 --> 18:15.517
Come on, guys. What the
fuck are we waiting for?

18:15.551 --> 18:18.453
Return to base. Still awaiting
Intel on the second Target.

18:18.487 --> 18:20.388
- That was not our intention.
- Okay, listen up...

18:20.423 --> 18:22.357
I want you running scans
on every subway station...

18:22.391 --> 18:27.361
Mr. Laszlo, Colonel Grant
cannot come to the phone.

18:27.396 --> 18:31.460
Tell me, have you
told Sergeant Scott

18:31.485 --> 18:32.685
that you framed him?

18:34.337 --> 18:37.439
Does he know your
role in Trojan Horse?

18:45.749 --> 18:48.284
<i>We understand</i>
<i>that an order has been given</i>

18:48.318 --> 18:50.519
<i>to evacuate all of</i>
<i>the world leaders...</i>

18:50.553 --> 18:52.928
<i>What's more worrying</i>
<i>is that the entire area</i>

18:52.929 --> 18:55.777
<i>surrounding the explosion</i>
<i>has been sealed off...</i>

18:55.825 --> 18:59.728
And hazmat decontamination teams
have been called to the site.

19:08.403 --> 19:10.075
<i>Emergency</i>
<i>services are asking</i>

19:10.076 --> 19:13.314
<i>people to stay inside...</i>
<i>and close their doors and...</i>

19:20.080 --> 19:22.548
We intercepted a local
police radio call.

19:22.583 --> 19:26.051
A VIP convoy was ambushed
en route from the airport.

19:26.086 --> 19:27.553
Ambushed?

19:33.060 --> 19:35.195
That's strange. I thought
all the leaders had arrived.

19:35.229 --> 19:36.396
They have.

19:36.430 --> 19:37.831
So, who's this?

19:44.071 --> 19:45.972
No
power on bank one.

19:46.006 --> 19:47.440
Got the comms.

19:51.712 --> 19:53.179
Everyone down!

20:04.692 --> 20:06.626
Murph, catch!

20:20.241 --> 20:21.308
Shit, you okay?

20:21.342 --> 20:22.909
Give me my gun!
Look, you're injured...

20:22.944 --> 20:25.177
I'm not dying without
my fucking gun!

20:41.827 --> 20:44.328
1, 2, 3...

20:51.605 --> 20:52.805
Fuck!

21:00.649 --> 21:02.884
Clear!

21:02.918 --> 21:06.287
Fuck. Sinclair, Richmond,
you all right?

21:06.322 --> 21:08.056
Here!

21:26.143 --> 21:29.112
Julia, you all right?
What happened?

21:29.147 --> 21:32.116
Colonel...
Colonel!

21:38.424 --> 21:40.124
They've gone.

21:40.158 --> 21:41.325
Shit.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.575
Thank you.

22:02.246 --> 22:05.115
- How the fuck did they find us?
- I don't know.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.130
You don't know?

22:06.155 --> 22:07.985
How convenient you don't
fucking know...

22:07.986 --> 22:10.654
Enough! Christ.

22:10.688 --> 22:17.395
I haven't betrayed anyone!
I haven't compromised anyone!

22:17.429 --> 22:19.931
So if you want to beat some
kind of confession out of me,

22:19.965 --> 22:21.778
you're gonna wait until
there are no more terrorists

22:21.803 --> 22:23.103
running around this city...

22:23.136 --> 22:26.705
With chemical bombs stitched
inside their fucking bodies!

22:28.074 --> 22:29.274
Fine.

22:31.244 --> 22:33.211
Good.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.280
What do we got?

22:36.314 --> 22:38.549
Well, the
mainframe's fucked.

22:38.583 --> 22:41.384
But the laptop should be able to
hook up to London.

22:41.419 --> 22:43.386
Let me help you.

22:43.421 --> 22:45.321
The first terrorist only tried to
detonate once he was confronted.

22:45.356 --> 22:46.992
If it was just about
killing people,

22:46.993 --> 22:48.225
he would have done it
on the subway.

22:53.732 --> 22:56.400
Laszlo.

22:56.435 --> 22:59.638
That tram was
headed towards the palace...

22:59.672 --> 23:02.875
Major Sinclair? I demand to
speak with your superior, right now.

23:02.909 --> 23:05.378
She's not here. As you can see,
our unit came under attack...

23:05.412 --> 23:07.447
Your unit has no mandate
or authorization...

23:07.481 --> 23:10.326
With respect, I have
already stopped one

23:10.351 --> 23:12.164
suicide bomber in this town...

23:12.720 --> 23:15.789
And we saved the lives of
God knows how many people.

23:15.824 --> 23:21.029
We think there's another, and
he's on his way to the Palace.

23:21.063 --> 23:24.533
So, please, either help us
or get out of our way!

23:32.575 --> 23:34.242
Is this your suspect?

23:34.277 --> 23:35.511
Yes, sir.

23:35.545 --> 23:37.946
Do you think you can recognize
this man in the crowd?

23:38.815 --> 23:40.149
Yes, I could.

23:49.292 --> 23:51.360
My officers will escort
you back to the palace.

23:51.394 --> 23:52.795
We'll have
tactical support.

23:52.829 --> 23:55.497
Thank you. Major.
What about the Colonel?

23:55.532 --> 23:56.899
The terrorist
threat first.

23:56.933 --> 23:58.500
Besides, we have no
idea where she is.

23:58.535 --> 24:00.636
We do if she's
with Latif.

24:00.670 --> 24:01.704
How?

24:01.738 --> 24:03.639
I put a tracker
in his dressing.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.107
Nice work.

24:06.142 --> 24:07.976
Just getting a signal now.

24:09.813 --> 24:12.447
Tura. Thirty-eight
kilometers from here.

24:12.482 --> 24:13.883
Okay, Michael, you
take the bomber.

24:13.917 --> 24:15.517
Scott, you take
the Colonel.

24:16.552 --> 24:17.987
What the hell
happened here?

24:19.756 --> 24:21.123
Carnage.

24:21.191 --> 24:22.925
By the way, Sinclair,
you hit like a girl.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.894
I don't know, he kind of hit
you pretty good, didn't he?

24:24.928 --> 24:27.897
It fucking hurt, buddy,
but don't tell him.

24:27.932 --> 24:29.499
Hey, Scott.
Yeah.

24:29.533 --> 24:32.768
Bring her back.
Shall do, buddy.

25:07.003 --> 25:08.437
So what can you tell me
about this man, Major?

25:08.472 --> 25:10.005
Thank you.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.066
We know that he's Chechen.

25:11.091 --> 25:12.771
But we have no name, no
date of birth...

25:12.909 --> 25:15.077
Major, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

25:15.111 --> 25:16.841
Just before she was killed,
Sally intercepted a

25:16.866 --> 25:18.066
communication between

25:18.076 --> 25:20.445
Hungarian security and
Pakistani intelligence.

25:21.150 --> 25:23.685
It refers to the VIP
convoy that was ambushed.

25:37.331 --> 25:39.666
The car that was
ambushed, he was in it.

25:42.736 --> 25:44.436
General Akmal Ramiz.

25:45.539 --> 25:46.772
Akmal?

25:46.807 --> 25:48.874
<i>The Pakistani</i>
<i>presidential candidate?</i>

25:48.909 --> 25:50.943
And our best hope of
peace in Pakistan.

25:52.312 --> 25:53.546
Latif...

25:55.316 --> 25:56.800
Your invitation to the
summit was not as secret

25:56.825 --> 25:58.892
as you thought, General.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.254
You have John Allen
to thank.

26:01.289 --> 26:04.518
You endanger the lives of
thousands with chemical

26:04.543 --> 26:06.432
weapons for one man?

26:06.994 --> 26:11.230
As ever, Colonel, you see
things so one-dimensionally.

26:11.265 --> 26:16.502
General Ramiz is a liar,
and a charlatan.

26:16.536 --> 26:18.703
But this is not a
mere abduction.

26:20.373 --> 26:23.441
You are witness to a
moment in history,

26:23.475 --> 26:27.645
and I am honored to have
such distinguished guests

26:27.680 --> 26:31.317
as the two principal architects
of Operation Trojan Horse.

26:36.257 --> 26:38.204
Trojan Horse was only
ever supposed to be an

26:38.229 --> 26:39.740
intelligence operation.

26:42.664 --> 26:45.996
Falsifying the evidence
of WMDs in Iraq

26:46.278 --> 26:47.920
made the case for war.

26:48.236 --> 26:50.184
But the road to hell is
paved with good intentions,

26:50.209 --> 26:51.478
isn't that right, Colonel?

26:54.708 --> 26:56.505
Intelligence wasn't enough.

26:58.311 --> 27:01.012
Which is where ATAT and
the Pakistani military

27:01.037 --> 27:02.768
proved so helpful.

27:03.182 --> 27:05.504
So the weapons were
made and transported to

27:05.529 --> 27:06.729
be placed inside Iraq.

27:06.818 --> 27:09.220
Sergeant?
Comms are back on.

27:09.254 --> 27:10.655
Thank you.
Sir?

27:10.689 --> 27:12.824
Scott?
What's your position.

27:16.929 --> 27:17.929
ETA in 10.

27:17.963 --> 27:19.197
<i>Copy that.</i>

27:19.231 --> 27:23.334
Trojan Horse was
necessary at the time.

27:23.368 --> 27:24.738
We had to justify the action

27:24.763 --> 27:29.536
of our western allies to our
own people.

27:29.575 --> 27:31.375
This is ancient history.

27:31.409 --> 27:32.910
But its relics survive.

27:36.314 --> 27:39.850
It is those relics that I
have sought and obtained,

27:39.884 --> 27:44.387
the very cache of VX that you
intended to plant inside Iraq.

27:44.422 --> 27:47.157
They were supposed
to be destroyed.

27:47.191 --> 27:50.294
The temptation to keep
them was too strong.

27:50.328 --> 27:55.233
However, ATAT didn't
hide them well enough,

27:55.267 --> 27:58.536
so today I deploy them,

28:00.239 --> 28:03.041
while the future of my nation

28:03.075 --> 28:08.113
is casually sealed over lunch
by foreign imperialists.

28:10.216 --> 28:11.483
And you grovel at
their feet...

28:11.518 --> 28:13.785
I came here to
save Pakistan!

28:13.820 --> 28:15.554
You want a craven
Pakistan!

28:16.756 --> 28:18.191
A Pakistan littered
with American bases!

28:18.192 --> 28:19.139
A Pakistan that would give

28:19.164 --> 28:20.954
away its nuclear weapons for
an empty promise...

28:20.960 --> 28:22.194
I am trying to
preserve my country

28:22.228 --> 28:25.097
against extremist traitors
who would tear it apart!

28:27.767 --> 28:29.134
Traitors...

28:31.104 --> 28:32.538
like you!

28:45.718 --> 28:47.719
I need you to
get me inside this crowd.

28:47.754 --> 28:48.954
Right.

28:57.931 --> 28:59.097
Move.

29:05.272 --> 29:08.107
You are going to confess
to Trojan Horse.

29:09.843 --> 29:11.746
Let the people of our
country see you for the

29:11.771 --> 29:13.346
hypocrite you really are.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.448
What do you hope
to achieve?

29:15.482 --> 29:18.985
The truth about these weapons
will shatter your credibility,

29:19.019 --> 29:23.456
awakening a new Pakistan,
a strong Pakistan.

29:23.491 --> 29:25.498
Unafraid to use its
nuclear weapons against

29:25.523 --> 29:26.941
its enemies in the west.

29:27.595 --> 29:29.329
And why should I
do your bidding?

29:33.535 --> 29:35.403
<i>...can't tell you</i>
<i>who they are.</i>

29:35.437 --> 29:38.798
In that crowd, a
martyr is ready to detonate

29:38.823 --> 29:40.830
a bomb containing your VX gas.

29:41.577 --> 29:43.811
He is waiting my
order to proceed.

29:43.846 --> 29:46.448
Or, if you comply,
I can call him off.

29:54.022 --> 29:56.423
They have to release
this crowd.

29:56.458 --> 29:57.991
Do you hear me?

29:58.025 --> 30:01.127
I can't. Not until all the
delegates are evacuated.

30:01.162 --> 30:02.929
They are my absolute
priority.

30:02.963 --> 30:04.664
Someone is going to
get crushed to death!

30:04.698 --> 30:06.733
You have to let
them out now!

30:08.636 --> 30:09.803
I'm sorry.

30:12.073 --> 30:15.443
You will kill those people
whether I talk or not.

30:17.112 --> 30:18.580
Akmal,

30:18.614 --> 30:21.250
my men will
intercept him.

30:22.419 --> 30:24.920
We've already stopped
one bomber.

30:24.954 --> 30:26.655
You can take that
chance, General.

30:27.657 --> 30:30.191
But the question remains.

30:30.225 --> 30:32.308
How do you weigh the
lives of thousands against

30:32.333 --> 30:34.043
your cherished reputation?

30:36.497 --> 30:39.632
What, you feel sympathy
for this man, Colonel?

30:39.667 --> 30:44.671
Placed in this terrible
position by a monster like me?

30:44.705 --> 30:46.639
The man who killed
John Porter?

30:54.182 --> 30:58.190
<i>I, John Porter,</i>
<i>confess to the crime of</i>

30:58.215 --> 30:59.572
<i>being a British spy.</i>

31:03.193 --> 31:05.061
But you must have
asked the question,

31:06.863 --> 31:08.764
who betrayed
John Porter to me?

31:14.204 --> 31:15.805
Why don't you tell her?

31:20.277 --> 31:22.178
I would not lie
to you, Eleanor.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.281
His handler
reported to me.

31:26.316 --> 31:29.119
Porter was getting
too close.

31:29.153 --> 31:32.758
He learned that the weapons were
a hangover from the operation.

31:32.858 --> 31:35.960
Knowledge of Trojan Horse
would have torn Pakistan in half...

31:35.994 --> 31:37.695
You gave him to Latif?

31:41.334 --> 31:45.557
I allowed certain elements
within ISI to let his

31:45.582 --> 31:47.377
whereabouts be known.

31:48.008 --> 31:50.942
A politician's answer.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.347
But perhaps we shouldn't
be too quick to judge.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.417
I saw Porter's last
report from Lahore.

32:01.254 --> 32:03.633
He told you he'd stumbled
across Trojan Horse,

32:03.658 --> 32:05.031
didn't he, Eleanor?

32:06.992 --> 32:09.060
But did you tell him
what you knew?

32:28.948 --> 32:31.050
Let's be frank.

32:31.084 --> 32:35.014
Mahmood, ATAT. You suspected the
connection right from the start...

32:35.255 --> 32:36.289
I...

32:36.323 --> 32:38.091
But you hid it
from your own section.

32:38.125 --> 32:39.692
I tried to stop you.

32:39.727 --> 32:41.694
But you only succeeded
in helping me.

32:43.731 --> 32:45.173
You didn't share your
suspicions with the people

32:45.198 --> 32:46.581
who trusted you the most.

32:48.569 --> 32:52.071
For what? Your
own ambition?

32:52.105 --> 32:54.307
My only ambition has been
to serve my country.

32:54.341 --> 32:56.042
For the sake of
your career?

32:56.076 --> 32:57.276
Not my career.
Reputation?

32:57.311 --> 32:58.277
Not my reputation.

32:58.312 --> 32:59.412
Then why?

32:59.446 --> 33:01.681
Because I was ashamed!

33:05.952 --> 33:07.686
I was ashamed
of what I'd done.

33:09.555 --> 33:13.491
Then your shame
killed Porter,

33:13.526 --> 33:15.715
and the others, as if

33:15.740 --> 33:17.541
you'd blown their brains
out yourself.

33:21.900 --> 33:25.335
Your silence meant the
sabotage of your own mission,

33:26.571 --> 33:29.006
and with it you were
my greatest ally.

34:11.418 --> 34:12.618
Move through!

34:17.322 --> 34:19.157
I see him!

34:19.190 --> 34:20.291
Get down!

34:20.324 --> 34:21.391
Down! Get down!

34:22.594 --> 34:24.462
<i>Get down!</i>

34:33.273 --> 34:34.540
Don't shoot!

34:57.797 --> 35:01.166
Look into the camera
and confess.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.900
Never.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.635
I will not do your bidding.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.641
I'll do it, I'll do
it. I'll confess.

35:10.676 --> 35:11.842
No!

35:11.877 --> 35:13.044
Does it matter
who says it?

35:13.078 --> 35:14.946
No, Eleanor, you
cannot confess.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.614
If you confess to Trojan
Horse you will destroy...

35:18.283 --> 35:20.952
No...

35:23.255 --> 35:24.956
Oh, fuck you...

35:28.327 --> 35:30.160
No, no, don't look at them.
No, don't shoot, don't shoot!

35:30.195 --> 35:31.261
Don't look at them!

35:31.296 --> 35:32.829
You look at me.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.368
It's okay.

35:39.804 --> 35:43.207
We're gonna let some of these
people go, all right?

35:43.241 --> 35:45.409
Go. Go!

35:56.356 --> 35:58.090
Now it's just
you and me.

36:03.163 --> 36:04.664
I need you to think.

36:07.534 --> 36:09.135
It's a child.

36:12.872 --> 36:14.473
It's a life.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.780
Just give it to me.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.322
It should have
been my brother.

36:33.258 --> 36:35.093
Put
the phone down.

36:46.674 --> 36:47.874
Give her here.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.445
It seems for you the
lies have been difficult

37:17.470 --> 37:18.934
to live with, Colonel.

37:23.981 --> 37:25.882
So why don't you
unburden yourself?

37:54.943 --> 37:59.613
I am Colonel Eleanor Grant,
British military intelligence.

38:11.059 --> 38:12.293
Ahhh!

38:14.096 --> 38:15.596
Ahhh!

38:33.148 --> 38:34.582
Thank you, Colonel.

38:34.617 --> 38:37.885
There's something else
I'd like to say,

38:37.920 --> 38:40.521
to my colleagues
in Section 20.

38:40.555 --> 38:42.122
Very well.

38:49.063 --> 38:51.632
Shit. Run! Get out of
here! Run! Run!

38:52.700 --> 38:53.901
Mike...

38:56.071 --> 38:58.639
Fuck! Someone's
armed the bomb!

38:58.673 --> 39:00.441
Get these people
out of here!

39:37.977 --> 39:40.545
Okay. Sinclair,
talk to me.

39:40.580 --> 39:42.947
I'm going to pull
out the detonator.

39:42.982 --> 39:44.582
No, don't touch the
det, it's on a trip.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.318
Fuck. Okay. Then
what do I do?

39:50.656 --> 39:51.756
Which wire do I cut?

39:51.790 --> 39:53.424
You have to
cut the earth.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.660
Which color is the earth
wire, Sinclair? Which one?

39:59.631 --> 40:01.032
<i>It's the one</i>
<i>that leads to the battery.</i>

40:01.066 --> 40:02.133
The brown one,
the brown one?

40:02.167 --> 40:03.701
Um, I'm not sure.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.369
<i>What color is the earth</i>
<i>wire, Sinclair? Which one?</i>

40:05.404 --> 40:06.671
Wait!
Fuck.

40:12.745 --> 40:13.812
<i>Sinclair!</i>

40:13.847 --> 40:15.214
Green? Brown? Tell me!

40:17.584 --> 40:18.818
<i>Sinclair?</i>

40:22.690 --> 40:24.225
Fuck it!

40:24.259 --> 40:25.459
Green.

40:54.421 --> 40:57.022
Finished?

40:57.056 --> 40:58.356
It's very touching,

40:59.592 --> 41:02.059
but I'll probably just
edit that out.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.689
Colonel!

41:31.723 --> 41:33.191
Damien, forgive me!

41:40.700 --> 41:42.802
Colonel!

41:42.836 --> 41:44.236
Colonel!

42:05.525 --> 42:07.259
Latif!

42:37.157 --> 42:42.795
<i>Secrets are an occupational</i>
<i>hazard in this job.</i>

42:42.829 --> 42:45.231
<i>But I have kept too</i>
<i>many for too long.</i>

42:46.567 --> 42:51.438
<i>Perhaps the burden</i>
<i>led to my mistakes.</i>

42:51.472 --> 42:54.008
<i>But everything I've done,</i>
<i>I have done for my country.</i>

42:57.513 --> 43:00.749
<i>For my involvement</i>
<i>in Trojan Horse,</i>

43:00.783 --> 43:04.401
<i>my failure to admit it,</i>
<i>and my part in John</i>

43:04.403 --> 43:07.284
<i>Porter's death, I have</i>
<i>nothing but regret.</i>

43:09.192 --> 43:11.427
<i>To Major Sinclair,</i>

43:11.461 --> 43:15.394
<i>if you're still alive,</i>
<i>I wish you every</i>

43:15.395 --> 43:19.745
<i>success your doggedness</i>
<i>and intellect deserve.</i>

43:21.503 --> 43:25.056
<i>To Sergeant Richmond, for</i>
<i>your camaraderie and your</i>

43:25.081 --> 43:26.669
<i>courage, I thank you.</i>

43:28.610 --> 43:34.349
<i>Damien Scott. Amongst my</i>
<i>effects there is a blue file.</i>

43:35.784 --> 43:37.619
<i>I tried to tell you.</i>

43:40.022 --> 43:41.957
<i>And to Michael Stonebridge,</i>

43:44.328 --> 43:48.131
<i>you are the finest soldier</i>
<i>I have ever known.</i>

43:55.939 --> 43:59.808
<i>Serving with you all has been</i>
<i>a privilege and an honor.</i>

44:03.913 --> 44:05.080
Colonel Grant.

44:06.415 --> 44:07.482
Colonel Grant.

44:07.516 --> 44:08.616
Colonel Grant.

44:08.651 --> 44:09.851
Colonel Grant.

44:39.013 --> 44:40.213
What are you going to do?

45:11.113 --> 45:13.281
She did give me
a second chance.

45:14.783 --> 45:17.118
I guess I should be
thankful for that.

45:23.157 --> 45:26.193
You gotta make a decision
too, buddy boy.

45:26.227 --> 45:27.427
Yeah, I know.

45:29.063 --> 45:30.230
And?

45:33.067 --> 45:34.802
I've already made it.

45:44.412 --> 45:46.013
Well, fuck me.

45:47.015 --> 45:48.382
Who's gonna make
me look good now?

45:48.417 --> 45:50.417
Huh?

45:50.452 --> 45:51.718
Shit.

45:51.753 --> 45:53.119
Daddy Stonebridge!

45:53.154 --> 45:54.988
I know. Up all night.

45:55.022 --> 45:56.389
Yeah.

45:57.658 --> 45:59.326
Not for the good
reasons.

46:00.461 --> 46:01.695
Fuck.
