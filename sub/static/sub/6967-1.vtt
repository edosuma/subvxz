01:34.094 --> 01:37.689
They put the time of death
between eight and twelve hours ago.

01:37.797 --> 01:42.063
No visible cause, no sign of battery
or sexual assault. All we have is this.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.004
Can we turn her over?

01:57.817 --> 01:59.148
Karen Swenson.

01:59.519 --> 02:03.717
- ls that a positive lD?
- She went to school with my son.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.823
Would that be the class of '89?

02:08.828 --> 02:11.092
lt's happening again, isn't it?

02:33.253 --> 02:35.483
Agent Dana Scully.

02:58.077 --> 02:59.135
Come in.

03:05.919 --> 03:09.685
Agent Scully, thank you for coming
on such short notice. Please.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.957
- You've been with us just over two years.
- Yes, sir.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.730
You went to medical school
but you chose not to practice.

03:23.803 --> 03:25.964
How'd you come to work for the FBl?

03:26.039 --> 03:29.304
Well, sir, l was recruited
out of medical school.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.936
My parents still think
it was an act of rebellion.

03:33.012 --> 03:36.948
But l saw the FBl as a place
where l could distinguish myself.

03:37.016 --> 03:40.645
Are you familiar
with an agent named Fox Mulder?

03:40.753 --> 03:42.812
Yes, l am.

03:42.922 --> 03:45.823
- How so?
- By reputation.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.027
He's an Oxford-educated psychologist

03:49.128 --> 03:52.825
who wrote a monograph
on serial killers and the occult

03:52.932 --> 03:55.628
that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988.

03:55.735 --> 04:00.832
Generally thought of as the best analyst
in the violent crime section.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.465
He had a nickname at the Academy.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.068
Spooky Mulder.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.608
Agent Mulder has developed
a consuming devotion

04:10.683 --> 04:14.619
to an unassigned project
outside the Bureau mainstream.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.553
Are you familiar with the so-called X-Files?

04:18.491 --> 04:21.392
l believe they have to do
with unexplained phenomena.

04:21.461 --> 04:22.894
More or less.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.955
The reason you're here is we want you
to assist Mulder on these X-Files.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.866
You'll write field reports on your activities

04:29.969 --> 04:32.836
and your observations
on the validity of the work.

04:34.774 --> 04:39.837
Am l to understand that you want me
to debunk the X-Files project, sir?

04:40.513 --> 04:43.880
We trust you'll make
the proper scientific analysis.

04:43.983 --> 04:48.079
You'll want to contact Agent Mulder.
We look forward to your reports.

05:00.533 --> 05:04.697
Sorry, nobody down here
but the FBl's Most Unwanted.

05:19.018 --> 05:23.546
Agent Mulder. l'm Dana Scully.
l've been assigned to work with you.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.922
Oh, isn't it nice
to be suddenly so highly regarded!

05:28.027 --> 05:30.518
Who did you tick off to get stuck with this?

05:30.630 --> 05:34.532
Actually, l'm looking forward to working
with you. l've heard a lot about you.

05:34.634 --> 05:39.833
Oh, really? l was under the impression
that you were sent to spy on me.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.865
lf you have any doubt
about my qualifications or credentials...

05:43.943 --> 05:47.572
You're a medical doctor.
You teach at the Academy.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.706
You did your undergraduate degree
in physics.

05:51.050 --> 05:55.248
''Einstein's Twin Paradox:
A New lnterpretation. Dana Scully.''

05:55.355 --> 05:58.153
That's a credential, rewriting Einstein.

05:58.257 --> 06:02.193
- Did you bother to read it?
- l did. l liked it.

06:02.328 --> 06:05.957
lt's just that in most of my work,
the laws of physics rarely seem to apply.

06:07.967 --> 06:10.959
Maybe l can get
your medical opinion on this though.

06:13.539 --> 06:17.737
Oregon female, age 21,
no explainable cause of death.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.711
Autopsy shows nothing. Zip.

06:20.947 --> 06:24.781
There are, however, these two
distinct marks on her lower back.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.183
Dr Scully, can you lD these marks?

06:31.724 --> 06:35.216
Needle punctures, maybe. An animal bite.

06:35.361 --> 06:36.953
Electrocution of some kind.

06:37.029 --> 06:40.965
How's your chemistry? This substance
was found in the surrounding tissue.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.428
lt's organic.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.141
l don't know.
ls it some kind of synthetic protein?

06:51.210 --> 06:56.375
l've never seen it before either.
But here it is again in Sturgis, South Dakota.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.514
And again in Shamrock, Texas.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.514
- Do you have a theory?
- l have plenty of theories.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.257
Maybe what you could explain to me
is why it's Bureau policy

07:07.393 --> 07:12.228
to label these cases as
unexplained phenomena and ignore them.

07:12.999 --> 07:16.059
Do you believe in the existence
of extraterrestrials?

07:17.537 --> 07:19.801
Logically, l would have to say no.

07:19.872 --> 07:23.399
Given the distances needed
to travel from deep space,

07:23.476 --> 07:26.240
the energy requirements would exceed...

07:26.379 --> 07:27.937
Conventional wisdom.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.677
This Oregon female
is the 4th person in her graduating class

07:31.784 --> 07:34.378
to die under mysterious circumstances.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.979
Now when convention and science
offer us no answers,

07:38.057 --> 07:42.391
might we not finally
turn to the fantastic as a plausibility?

07:42.895 --> 07:46.763
The girl obviously died of something.
lf it was natural causes,

07:46.833 --> 07:49.631
maybe something was missed
in the postmortem.

07:49.702 --> 07:53.763
lf she was murdered, it's plausible
there was a sloppy investigation.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.865
What l find fantastic

07:55.975 --> 07:59.376
is any notion that there are answers
beyond the realm of science.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.814
The answers are there.
You just have to know where to look.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.852
That's why they put the ''l'' in FBl.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.048
See you tomorrow morning, Scully.
Bright and early.

08:11.123 --> 08:15.583
We leave for the very plausible state
of Oregon at 8am.

08:46.058 --> 08:49.687
Would all passengers
fasten their seat belts

08:49.762 --> 08:51.696
as we're about to make...

09:11.317 --> 09:13.285
This must be the place.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.474
You didn't mention yesterday
this case has already been investigated.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.102
The FBl got involved
after the first three deaths

09:39.178 --> 09:42.113
when local authorities
failed to turn up any evidence.

09:42.181 --> 09:45.742
Our boys came out here,
enjoyed the local salmon,

09:45.818 --> 09:49.379
which, with a little lemon twist,
is just to die for.

09:49.488 --> 09:52.286
Without explanation
they were called back in,

09:52.391 --> 09:56.327
the case was reclassified and buried
in the X-Files until l dug it up.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.227
And you found something they didn't?

09:59.332 --> 10:05.601
The autopsy reports of the first three victims
show no unidentified marks.

10:06.038 --> 10:09.735
But those reports were signed by a different
medical examiner than the latest victim.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.743
That's good, Scully.

10:11.811 --> 10:15.372
Better than you expected
or better than you hoped?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.916
l'll let you know
when we get past the easy part.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.914
ls the medical examiner a suspect?

10:22.989 --> 10:26.948
We don't know yet. l've arranged
to exhume one of the other victims' bodies

10:27.026 --> 10:30.427
to see if we can get
a tissue sample to match the girl's.

10:30.529 --> 10:34.761
- You're not squeamish, are you?
- l don't know. l've never had the pleasure.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.637
What's going on?

11:30.423 --> 11:34.519
- What the hell was that about?
- Oh, you know. Probably nothing.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.685
Mr Mulder,
John Truitt, County Coroner's Office.

12:04.757 --> 12:08.818
Yeah, hi. This is Agent Scully.
How soon can we get started?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.953
- We're ready to go.
- Oh, great!

12:11.063 --> 12:13.896
Were you able to arrange
for an examination facility?

12:13.966 --> 12:18.266
- We got something for ya.
- Excuse me! Excuse me.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.100
No.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.298
Please!

12:22.775 --> 12:24.868
Please stay in the car!

12:29.548 --> 12:31.539
l don't know who you think you are.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.983
You think you can come up here
and do whatever you please!

12:35.054 --> 12:36.544
l'm sorry. You are...?

12:36.622 --> 12:39.489
l'm Dr Jay Nemman,
County Medical Examiner.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.049
Surely you were told of our intentions?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.255
No. No, we've been away.

12:44.330 --> 12:47.356
Oh! Well, that answers
a question that we had.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.799
Why you hadn't done
the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson.

12:50.903 --> 12:53.895
You're aware of the tissue sample
taken from her?

12:53.973 --> 12:56.100
What is the insinuation here?

12:56.175 --> 12:58.803
That l missed something in those other kids?

12:58.911 --> 13:02.312
- We're not insinuating anything, sir.
- Wait a minute!

13:02.381 --> 13:03.973
See, l think you are!

13:04.083 --> 13:06.574
And you'd better have something
to back it up.

13:06.685 --> 13:10.519
Daddy, please! Let's just go home.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.819
Let's go home! Please!

13:19.899 --> 13:22.732
The guy obviously needed a longer vacation.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.195
Ray Soames was the third victim.

13:26.305 --> 13:31.937
He spent time in a state mental hospital,
treated for post-adolescent schizophrenia.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.707
Soames confessed to the first two murders

13:34.780 --> 13:38.773
but couldn't produce any evidence
that he committed the crimes.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.785
Did you read the cause of death?

13:40.853 --> 13:45.051
Exposure. His body was found in the woods
after escaping the hospital.

13:45.157 --> 13:50.151
Missing for only seven hours in July.
How does a 20-year-old boy die of exposure

13:50.229 --> 13:53.255
on a warm, summer night
in Oregon, Dr Scully?

13:53.365 --> 13:55.458
l got it.

14:15.988 --> 14:19.617
- This isn't official procedure.
- Really?

14:28.067 --> 14:33.505
lt's probably a safe bet Ray Soames
never made the varsity basketball team.

14:35.007 --> 14:38.636
Seal this up now!
Nobody sees or touches this. Nobody!

14:46.785 --> 14:49.913
This is amazing!
Do you know what this could mean?

14:50.923 --> 14:53.050
lt's almost too big to comprehend.

14:53.125 --> 14:58.119
The subject is 156cms in length,
weighing 52lbs in extremis.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.721
Corpse is in advanced stages
of decay and desiccation.

15:00.833 --> 15:04.997
Distinguishing features
include large ocular cavities.

15:05.070 --> 15:09.598
Oblate cranium indicates
subject is not human.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.939
Could you point that flash
away from me, please?

15:12.044 --> 15:14.706
lf it's not human, what is it?

15:14.813 --> 15:15.871
lt's familian.

15:15.948 --> 15:20.885
A chimpanzee or something from
the ape family. Possibly an orangutan.

15:20.953 --> 15:24.855
Buried in the city cemetery
in Ray Soames's grave.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.325
Try telling that to Ray Soames's family!

15:28.427 --> 15:30.486
l want tissue samples, X-rays,

15:30.562 --> 15:33.861
blood typing, toxicology
and a full genetic work-up.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.265
- You're serious?
- What we can't do here, we'll order to go.

15:36.335 --> 15:40.431
You don't honestly believe
this is some kind of an extraterrestrial?

15:40.539 --> 15:44.270
- This is somebody's sickjoke.
- We can do those X-rays here?

15:44.343 --> 15:46.277
Can't we do them right now?

15:49.348 --> 15:51.441
l'm not crazy, Scully.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.952
l have the same doubts you do.

15:55.921 --> 15:59.948
Visual inspection
of the body and X-ray analysis

16:00.059 --> 16:04.359
confirms homologous but
possibly mutated mammalian physiology.

16:04.496 --> 16:07.329
However, does not account for

16:07.399 --> 16:11.165
small unidentified object
found in subject's nasal cavity.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.204
A gray metallic implant...

16:21.880 --> 16:23.370
Who is it?

16:23.515 --> 16:25.676
Steven Spielberg!

16:36.628 --> 16:38.789
l'm going for a run. You wanna come?

16:38.897 --> 16:39.921
Pass.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.968
You figure out what was up
Ray Soames's nose yet?

16:43.035 --> 16:44.730
No.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.237
And l'm not losing sleep over it. Good night.

17:06.125 --> 17:09.060
Ray Soames was a patient of mine, yes.

17:09.161 --> 17:14.723
l oversaw his treatment for a year for clinical
schizophrenia. He couldn't grasp reality.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.361
He suffered from some kind
of post-traumatic stress.

17:18.436 --> 17:21.929
- Have you seen it before?
- l've treated similar cases.

17:22.007 --> 17:24.635
Were any of those
Ray Soames's classmates?

17:24.742 --> 17:25.767
Yes.

17:25.844 --> 17:29.007
We're trying to find a connection
in these deaths.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.811
Did you treat any of these kids
with hypnosis?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.181
No, l did not.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.881
- Are you treating any of these kids now?
- Currently?

17:36.989 --> 17:39.856
Yes, l'm treating Billy Miles
and Peggy O'Dell.

17:39.958 --> 17:42.017
Both long-term live-in patients.

17:42.094 --> 17:46.554
- They're here at this hospital?
- That's right. Going on four years now.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.224
Can we talk to them?

17:49.601 --> 17:52.035
Well, you might find it difficult,

17:52.104 --> 17:54.038
certainly in Billy Miles' case.

17:54.106 --> 17:57.007
Billy's experiencing a waking coma.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.240
His brain waves are flat
and he's persistent vegetative.

18:01.313 --> 18:03.247
How did it happen?

18:03.315 --> 18:06.876
He and Peggy were involved
in an automobile accident on State Road.

18:08.053 --> 18:09.020
Peggy?

18:11.190 --> 18:14.284
We have some visitors.
Would you like to talk with them?

18:14.393 --> 18:16.657
Billy wants me to read now.

18:21.266 --> 18:25.293
- Does he like it when you read to him?
- Yes.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.398
Billy needs me close.

18:28.474 --> 18:29.532
Doctor?

18:30.476 --> 18:34.879
l'm wondering if we can do
a cursory medical exam on Peggy.

18:35.814 --> 18:38.647
Peggy, what are you doing?

18:41.019 --> 18:43.715
No one is going to hurt you!

18:43.822 --> 18:48.156
Get an orderly! Nobody's
going to hurt you. The nurse is here.

18:50.028 --> 18:52.656
lt's all right. lt's all right.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.157
Peggy, you're going to be fine.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.568
You've had these nosebleeds before.
Now calm down.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.639
Whatshisname... Billy said he was sorry
he didn't get to say goodbye.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.643
How did you know she'd have the marks?

19:12.718 --> 19:14.777
l don't know. Lucky guess?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.253
Dammit, Mulder, cut the crap.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.348
What do you know about those marks?
What are they?

19:20.459 --> 19:24.657
Why? So you can put it in your report?
You're not ready for what l think.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.665
l'm here to solve this case. l want the truth.

19:27.966 --> 19:30.901
The truth?
l think those kids have been abducted.

19:31.770 --> 19:32.668
By who?

19:33.338 --> 19:34.327
By what?

19:36.375 --> 19:40.141
- You don't really believe that?
- Do you have a better explanation?

19:40.212 --> 19:44.171
l'll buy that girl is suffering
some kind of pronounced psychosis.

19:44.283 --> 19:48.515
Whether it's organic
or the result of those marks, l can't say.

19:48.620 --> 19:52.317
But to say that they've been riding around
in flying saucers is crazy!

19:52.391 --> 19:55.883
- There is nothing to support that.
- Nothing scientific.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.925
There has got to be an explanation.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.960
You've got four victims.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.299
All of them died in or near the woods.

20:05.370 --> 20:09.170
They found Karen Swenson's body
in the forest in her pajamas

20:09.241 --> 20:13.200
ten miles from her house.
How did she get there?

20:13.312 --> 20:16.611
What were those kids doing
out there in the forest?

21:18.210 --> 21:20.269
Mulder?

21:52.311 --> 21:53.869
Mulder, is that you?

21:57.482 --> 21:59.848
Mulder?

22:13.065 --> 22:16.694
Special Agent Dana Scully, FBl.
Drop your weapon.

22:16.768 --> 22:20.169
l'm with the County Sheriff's Department.

22:20.272 --> 22:25.232
- You're trespassing on private property here.
- We are conducting an investigation.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.175
Get in your car and leave!

22:27.279 --> 22:30.476
Or l'll have to arrest you.
l don't care who you are.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.483
Hold on! This is a crime scene.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.678
Did you hear what l said?

22:35.721 --> 22:38.986
You are on private property
without legal permission.

22:39.091 --> 22:44.290
Now l'm only gonna say it one more time -
get in your car and leave!

23:25.103 --> 23:27.230
What's he doing out here all by himself?

23:28.540 --> 23:30.906
Maybe it has something to do with this.

23:32.377 --> 23:34.436
What do you think it is?

23:37.916 --> 23:39.543
l don't know.

23:39.651 --> 23:43.018
- ls it a campfire?
- lt was all over the ground.

23:43.121 --> 23:48.024
l think something's going on out here.
Some kind of a sacrifice, maybe.

23:48.126 --> 23:51.357
What if these kids are involved
in some kind of a cult

23:51.430 --> 23:53.921
and that man knows something about it?

23:53.999 --> 23:55.762
l wanna come back here.

24:05.744 --> 24:07.803
You OK, Mulder?

24:09.748 --> 24:12.478
- Yeah, l'm just...
- What are you looking for?

24:26.164 --> 24:28.655
- What happened?
- We lost power.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.167
Brakes, steering, everything.

24:33.839 --> 24:35.898
We lost nine minutes!

24:38.210 --> 24:40.269
We lost what?

24:40.378 --> 24:42.437
Nine minutes!

24:42.514 --> 24:47.781
l looked at my watch just before the flash,
it was 9:03 - itjust turned 9:13.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.450
Look!

24:50.522 --> 24:52.649
Look!

24:53.124 --> 24:55.024
Oh, yes!

24:55.093 --> 24:56.685
Abductees!

24:57.729 --> 25:01.130
People that have sighted UFOs
reported unexplained time loss.

25:01.233 --> 25:04.669
- Come on!
- Gone! Just like that!

25:04.736 --> 25:06.465
No, wait a minute.

25:06.538 --> 25:11.339
You're saying that time disappeared?
Time can'tjust disappear!

25:11.443 --> 25:13.934
lt's a universal invariance!

25:17.849 --> 25:19.840
Not in this zip code.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.108
Great!

26:20.145 --> 26:20.804
Hi!

26:20.912 --> 26:24.404
- l want you to look at something.
- Come on in.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.001
What are they?

26:53.345 --> 26:54.437
Mulder, what are they?

26:56.381 --> 26:57.405
Mosquito bites.

26:57.515 --> 27:01.611
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. l got eaten up alive myself out there.

27:05.824 --> 27:07.917
You OK?

27:09.861 --> 27:11.556
Yes.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.224
- You're shaking.
- l need to sit down.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.628
Take your time.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.777
l was 12 when it happened.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.641
My sister was eight.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.784
She just disappeared
out of her bed one night.

27:37.455 --> 27:40.219
Just gone. Vanished.

27:40.291 --> 27:43.454
No note. No phone calls.
No evidence of anything.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.689
You never found her?

27:46.798 --> 27:50.165
lt tore the family apart.
No one would talk about it.

27:50.235 --> 27:54.296
There were no facts to confront.
Nothing to offer any hope.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.865
What did you do?

27:57.976 --> 28:02.970
l went off to school in England.
l came back, got recruited by the Bureau.

28:03.048 --> 28:08.611
lt seems l had a natural aptitude for applying
behavioral models to criminal cases.

28:13.825 --> 28:18.194
My success allowed me a certain freedom
to pursue my own interests.

28:18.263 --> 28:21.130
And that's when l came across the X-Files.

28:21.232 --> 28:22.665
By accident?

28:22.801 --> 28:28.205
At first it looked like a garbage dump for
UFO sightings, alien abduction reports,

28:28.273 --> 28:30.833
the kind of stuff most people laugh at.

28:30.909 --> 28:35.437
But l was fascinated. l read
all the cases l could get my hands on.

28:35.513 --> 28:40.610
l read everything about paranormal
phenomena, about the occult and...

28:43.455 --> 28:44.444
What?

28:46.357 --> 28:49.622
There's classified government information
l've been trying to access

28:49.728 --> 28:51.958
but someone has been blocking me.

28:52.063 --> 28:57.160
- Who? l don't understand.
- Someone at a higher level of power.

28:57.268 --> 29:01.762
l'm allowed to continue my work because
l've made connections in Congress.

29:01.873 --> 29:05.274
And they're afraid
you'll leak this information?

29:06.077 --> 29:08.136
You're part of that agenda. You know that.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.273
l'm not a part of any agenda.

29:12.317 --> 29:17.653
You've got to trust me.
l'm here just like you, to solve this.

29:21.860 --> 29:25.387
l'm telling you this, Scully,
because you need to know.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.692
Because of what you've seen.

29:29.567 --> 29:33.003
ln my research l've worked very closely
with a man named Dr Heitz Werber.

29:33.104 --> 29:36.198
He's taken me through
deep-regression hypnosis.

29:36.307 --> 29:41.506
l've been able to go into my own repressed
memories to the night my sister disappeared.

29:41.579 --> 29:46.312
l can recall a bright light outside
and a presence in the room.

29:46.384 --> 29:48.409
l was paralyzed,

29:48.520 --> 29:52.684
unable to respond
to my sister's calls for help.

29:53.358 --> 29:56.384
Listen to me, Scully! This thing exists.

29:56.494 --> 29:59.930
- But how do you know...
- The government knows about it.

29:59.998 --> 30:04.935
And l gotta know what they're protecting.
Nothing else matters to me.

30:05.003 --> 30:07.767
And this is as close as l've ever gotten to it.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.611
Hello?

30:17.715 --> 30:18.977
What?!

30:19.050 --> 30:20.847
Who is this?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.018
Who is th...

30:28.026 --> 30:32.622
That was some woman
who just said Peggy O'Dell was dead.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.590
The girl in the wheelchair?

30:53.017 --> 30:55.986
- What happened?
- She ran out in front of me.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.818
- Who are you?
- She was running?

30:58.890 --> 31:00.084
On foot?

31:20.712 --> 31:23.875
- That's just... Let's go!
- We need to ask a few questions.

31:23.982 --> 31:26.678
Someone trashed the lab
and they stole the body.

31:26.818 --> 31:30.720
- We're going back to the motel.
- What? They stole the corpse?

31:36.494 --> 31:38.394
FBl.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.391
There goes my computer!

31:43.201 --> 31:44.896
Dammit!

31:45.003 --> 31:46.903
The X-rays and pictures!

32:01.352 --> 32:03.547
My name is Teresa Nemman.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.554
You've got to protect me!

32:08.960 --> 32:10.552
Come with us.

32:11.529 --> 32:13.463
This is the way it happens.

32:13.531 --> 32:16.694
l don't know how l get out there.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.735
l'll just find myself out in the woods.

32:19.871 --> 32:24.308
- How long has it been happening?
- Ever since the summer we graduated.

32:24.375 --> 32:28.709
lt's happened to my friends, too.
That's why l need you to protect me.

32:28.846 --> 32:33.374
l'm scared l might... die, like the others.

32:33.484 --> 32:36.647
Like... Peggy did tonight.

32:36.721 --> 32:40.851
Your father's the medical examiner.
You were the one on the phone.

32:40.925 --> 32:43.860
You told me Peggy O'Dell had been killed.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.933
Teresa, your father knows about this,
doesn't he?

32:52.203 --> 32:54.103
About what happens?

32:55.106 --> 32:59.509
Yes. But he said
never to tell anyone about any of it.

32:59.577 --> 33:02.808
- Why?
- He wants to protect me.

33:02.914 --> 33:07.408
He thinks he can protect me.
But l don't think he can.

33:08.419 --> 33:10.216
Do you have the marks, Teresa?

33:12.623 --> 33:14.716
Yes.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.562
l'm going to die, aren't l? l'm gonna be next!

33:19.630 --> 33:22.428
No, you're not going to die.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.363
Oh, God!

33:29.574 --> 33:31.633
Let's go home, Teresa.

33:32.377 --> 33:35.505
Teresa, come on. Come on, honey.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.641
- l don't think she wants to leave.
- l don't care what you think!

33:39.751 --> 33:41.013
She's sick.

33:41.119 --> 33:44.316
Your father wants to take you home.
He'll clean you up.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.584
l'll take you where you'll be safe.

33:46.657 --> 33:50.423
Detective Miles and l
won't let anything happen to you.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.587
You're Billy Miles's father?

33:52.663 --> 33:57.157
That's right.
And you stay away from that boy.

34:01.539 --> 34:05.475
Ah, you gotta love this place.
Every day is like Halloween.

34:05.576 --> 34:09.569
They know, Mulder. They know
who's responsible for the murders.

34:09.647 --> 34:11.547
They know something.

34:11.616 --> 34:15.052
Dr Nemman's been hiding
medical evidence from the beginning.

34:15.152 --> 34:18.850
He lied on the autopsy.
And now we find out about the detective.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.187
Who else would have reason
to trash the lab and our rooms?

34:22.260 --> 34:27.061
Why would they destroy evidence?
What would they want with that corpse?

34:28.032 --> 34:29.056
l don't know.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.694
Makes you wonder
what's in those other two graves.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.991
- They're both empty.
- What is going on here?

34:56.494 --> 35:01.090
l think l know who did it.
l think l know who killed Karen Swenson.

35:01.199 --> 35:03.667
Who? The detective?

35:03.734 --> 35:06.259
The detective's son.

35:07.805 --> 35:09.295
Billy Miles.

35:09.407 --> 35:13.036
The boy in the hospital? The vegetable?

35:20.351 --> 35:22.080
Billy Miles?

35:22.753 --> 35:27.053
A boy who's been in a coma for four years
came here and dug up these graves?

35:27.125 --> 35:30.720
Peggy O'Dell was in a wheelchair
but she ran in front of a truck.

35:30.862 --> 35:34.320
Look, it all fits a profile of alien abduction.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.127
This fits a profile?

35:36.234 --> 35:40.330
Peggy O'Dell was killed around nine.
The same time we lost nine minutes.

35:40.438 --> 35:44.898
Something happened then.
l think that time, as we know it, stopped.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.501
And something took control over it.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.977
You think l'm crazy.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.284
What?

36:05.963 --> 36:09.763
Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped
a couple of minutes after nine.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.131
l made a note of it when l saw the body.

36:12.203 --> 36:16.697
That's why the kids come to the forest.
lt controls them. lt summons them.

36:16.774 --> 36:21.677
And the marks are from some kind of tests
being done on them.

36:21.746 --> 36:24.544
And that maybe causes
some kind of genetic mutation,

36:24.615 --> 36:27.083
which explains the body we dug up.

36:27.151 --> 36:32.282
And the force summoned Teresa Nemman's
body into the woods tonight.

36:32.356 --> 36:35.120
Yes! But Billy Miles took her there.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.594
Summoned by some alien impulse.
That's it!

36:46.170 --> 36:48.138
Come on, let's get out of here.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.698
- Where are we going?
- We're gonna visit Billy Miles.

36:51.776 --> 36:54.973
We could be here until the Second Coming

36:55.046 --> 36:58.015
waiting for Billy to get out of this bed.

36:58.115 --> 37:01.744
lt ain't gonna happen. He blinks

37:01.819 --> 37:03.514
and l know about it.

37:04.388 --> 37:08.518
- l guess you changed his bedpan last night.
- Nobody else here's gonna do it.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.652
You noticed nothing unusual?

37:12.163 --> 37:15.564
Do you remember what you were doing
last night around nine o'clock?

37:15.633 --> 37:19.626
Probably... watching TV. Yeah.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.228
Do you remember what you were watching?

37:22.340 --> 37:24.399
Let's see.

37:25.443 --> 37:28.071
l don't really remember what l watched.

37:28.179 --> 37:29.373
Miss?

37:33.351 --> 37:35.581
What is she looking for?

37:37.655 --> 37:39.748
Mulder, take a look at this.

37:49.166 --> 37:53.296
- Who took care of Peggy last night?
- Not me. lt's not my ward.

37:53.404 --> 37:55.964
Not my aisle of the produce section.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.071
l do have ajob of my own to do.

37:59.176 --> 38:00.609
What is she doing now?

38:00.678 --> 38:02.407
Thank you for your time.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.448
- OK.
- Good day.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.085
That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell!

38:09.186 --> 38:11.780
- Scully...
- lt's crazy!

38:11.856 --> 38:14.791
- He was in the woods!
- You're sure?

38:14.859 --> 38:18.317
This is the same stuff
l took a handful of in the forest.

38:18.429 --> 38:23.332
- We should run a test on it.
- We lost the original sample in the fire.

38:23.434 --> 38:26.631
l want you to understand
what it is you're saying.

38:26.704 --> 38:30.435
- You said it yourself.
- You have to write it in your report.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.405
You're right.

38:37.148 --> 38:42.609
We'll take another sample from the forest
and run a comparison before we do anything.

38:48.359 --> 38:50.850
The detective's here.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.065
What do you think?

39:24.495 --> 39:26.554
You wouldn't listen to me.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.524
l told you to stay out of this.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.080
Hold it! Hold it right there!

39:46.884 --> 39:48.408
You got no business out here.

39:48.519 --> 39:51.784
- There were screams.
- Down on the ground.

39:51.889 --> 39:52.947
Now!

39:53.023 --> 39:54.615
You know it's Billy.

39:55.626 --> 39:56.991
You've known it all along.

39:57.094 --> 40:01.690
- l said down on the ground.
- How long are you gonna let it happen?

40:04.702 --> 40:05.828
He's gonna kill her!

40:13.043 --> 40:16.444
Billy, no! Let her go!

40:18.315 --> 40:20.374
Leave her alone!

41:20.444 --> 41:21.843
Dad?

41:22.813 --> 41:23.837
Billy...

41:27.852 --> 41:29.979
Oh, God!

41:39.697 --> 41:41.130
Scully!

41:46.504 --> 41:49.473
- Scully!
- Mulder, what happened?

41:49.540 --> 41:51.633
There was a light...

41:51.709 --> 41:53.609
lt was incredible.

42:01.051 --> 42:04.043
lf you can hear me, raise your right hand.

42:08.225 --> 42:10.284
Tell me about the light, Billy.

42:11.328 --> 42:13.660
When did you first see the light?

42:15.566 --> 42:17.500
ln the forest.

42:18.502 --> 42:21.266
We were all in the forest having a party.

42:22.339 --> 42:24.432
All my friends.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.469
We were celebrating.

42:27.545 --> 42:31.311
- What were you celebrating?
- Graduation.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.873
And then the light came.

42:33.984 --> 42:37.385
lt took me away... to the testing place.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.287
They would tell me to gather the others

42:43.160 --> 42:44.855
so that they could do tests.

42:47.331 --> 42:50.459
They put something in my head.

42:51.936 --> 42:53.403
Here.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.865
l would wait for their orders.

42:58.275 --> 43:01.403
Billy, who gave the orders?

43:02.513 --> 43:04.003
The light.

43:04.114 --> 43:06.947
They said it would be OK.
No one would know.

43:08.185 --> 43:12.884
But the tests didn't work.
They wanted everything destroyed.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.584
They said they were leaving.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.155
l'm afraid.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.592
l'm afraid they're coming back.

43:26.904 --> 43:29.930
Don't be afraid, Billy.
We're here to help you.

43:44.922 --> 43:49.222
What we've just witnessed,
what we've read in your field reports,

43:49.326 --> 43:53.820
the scientific basis and credibility
just seem wholly unsupportable.

43:53.931 --> 43:56.126
- You're aware of that?
- Yes, sir.

43:56.200 --> 43:59.033
My reports are personal and subjective.

43:59.136 --> 44:02.401
l haven't drawn any conclusion
about what l've seen.

44:02.473 --> 44:05.033
Or haven't seen, as seems to be the case.

44:06.043 --> 44:11.037
This... time loss.
You did or did not experience it?

44:11.148 --> 44:13.378
l can't substantiate it. No.

44:13.450 --> 44:16.476
What exactly can you substantiate,
Agent Scully?

44:17.221 --> 44:20.782
l see no evidence thatjustifies
the legitimacy of these investigations.

44:21.592 --> 44:24.060
There were, of course, crimes committed.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.891
Yes, but how do you prosecute
a case like this?

44:27.031 --> 44:29.431
With testimony given under hypnosis

44:29.500 --> 44:33.800
from a boy who claims
he was given orders from an alien force

44:33.871 --> 44:36.897
through an implant in his nose.

44:38.642 --> 44:40.701
You have no physical evidence.

44:44.581 --> 44:49.450
This is the object described by Billy Miles
as a communication device.

44:50.621 --> 44:52.384
l removed it from the exhumed body.

44:52.823 --> 44:57.453
l kept it in my pocket. lt was the only piece
of evidence not destroyed in the fire.

44:58.328 --> 45:03.891
l ran a lab test on it.
The material could not be identified.

45:07.137 --> 45:11.073
Agent Mulder. What are his thoughts?

45:12.342 --> 45:16.142
Agent Mulder believes we are not alone.

45:18.248 --> 45:20.944
Thank you, Agent Scully. That'll be all.

46:00.357 --> 46:01.847
Hello?

46:01.925 --> 46:05.918
Scully, it's me. l haven't been able to sleep.

46:05.996 --> 46:09.557
l talked to the DA's office
in Raymon County, Oregon.

46:09.666 --> 46:12.157
There's no case file on Billy Miles.

46:12.269 --> 46:14.533
The paperwork we filed is gone.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.934
We need to talk, Scully.

46:20.544 --> 46:22.705
Yes... tomorrow.
