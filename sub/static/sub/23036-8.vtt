WEBVTT

00:07.474 --> 00:08.842
[cheering]

00:10.910 --> 00:12.812
[Tiki] Twelve athletes, one mission:

00:12.879 --> 00:14.481
to be tonight's sole survivor.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.116
What are you worried about now?

00:16.416 --> 00:18.084
Right, I think the landing...

00:18.151 --> 00:21.855
[Tiki] Each thinks they have the winning
strategy to conquer the Beast.

00:21.921 --> 00:24.991
That was OK,
but you need to use your arms more.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.560
Grab the rope with both hands, and go.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.396
[Tiki] But whose plans prevail...

00:29.462 --> 00:32.966
-I want to save energy for the Mag Wall.
-Right.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.501
[Tiki] ...once the Beast...

00:34.567 --> 00:36.202
[Tiki] This is not an easy jump here.

00:36.269 --> 00:37.270
[Tiki] ...bites back?

00:38.405 --> 00:39.706
[groaning]

00:40.573 --> 00:42.575
We have to do it today.
I know you can do it.

00:42.642 --> 00:44.611
[Tiki] The hopes of an entire nation...

00:44.677 --> 00:45.945
Give it your all tonight.

00:46.012 --> 00:48.348
[Tiki] ...and the glory of a lifetime,
on the line.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.350
I fight for China!

00:51.051 --> 00:52.852
[Tiki] Who will become the one...

00:52.919 --> 00:54.721
She has become confident.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.523
[Tiki] ...and only...

00:57.590 --> 00:58.691
Beastmaster?

00:58.758 --> 00:59.692
[cheers]

01:00.126 --> 01:00.994
USA!

01:01.061 --> 01:01.928
Let's do it!

01:01.995 --> 01:03.997
[theme music playing]

01:10.904 --> 01:12.906
[cheers]

01:14.307 --> 01:18.278
[Tiki] I wanna know where on earth
you find something like that!

01:18.344 --> 01:19.913
[Chris] I don't have any idea.

01:19.979 --> 01:22.782
But it hasn't been in California
long enough to be vegan,

01:22.849 --> 01:24.584
because this thing's out for meat.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.921
Welcome, everyone. I'm Tiki Barber
and with me is Chris Distefano.

01:28.521 --> 01:32.058
Right now, 12 new competitors
are gearing up to take a shot

01:32.125 --> 01:36.563
at tonight's $10,000 prize
and a spot in the final round,

01:36.629 --> 01:41.801
where one of them
will become the Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:41.868 --> 01:44.437
So far, seven athletes have advanced.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.040
Tonight, who will become number eight?

01:47.107 --> 01:51.511
Earlier this evening, Chris and I got
to hang with our two American athletes,

01:51.578 --> 01:55.381
and there's no doubt,
they're ready to kick some USA.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.517
-So what do you do?
-I'm a martial artist.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.385
[Chris] Really? Show us a roundhouse kick.

02:01.988 --> 02:06.493
That's what's gonna happen!
Spain, India, fricking China...

02:07.460 --> 02:11.564
[Tiki] This black belt martial arts master
hopes to karate chop the competition.

02:12.532 --> 02:15.535
My martial arts background
will give me a lot of advantages.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.605
I have great balance. I am fast.

02:18.671 --> 02:22.175
But not only that, I'm gonna have
the advantage in the mental arena, too.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.345
I am gonna crush the Beast.

02:25.411 --> 02:27.046
-[Chris] You're in the Air Force.
-I am.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.883
Wow, man. You've shot down dragons before.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.719
-Yeah, we don't like to talk about that.
-Right.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.322
[Tiki] This Air Force medic
hopes to flatline the Beast,

02:36.389 --> 02:39.826
with strict orders of
"Do not resuscitate".

02:39.959 --> 02:43.730
I participated in the 36-hour
Navy SEAL Challenge.

02:43.796 --> 02:46.666
Just a bunch of running,
a bunch of push-ups and pull-ups,

02:46.733 --> 02:48.434
carrying telephone poles around,

02:48.501 --> 02:51.771
and getting colder and wetter
than most people would prefer to be.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.308
Completing that challenge
took my confidence to a whole new level.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.243
I can take on the world right now.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.013
1, 2, 3! USA!

03:03.950 --> 03:07.086
[Chris] Our Americans are fired up
and ready to rock.

03:07.153 --> 03:10.723
And the good news -
kicking us off, it's Luke Russell.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.160
Here we go, USA!

03:14.227 --> 03:16.095
[Tiki] Here he is,
at the mouth of the Beast.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.331
Do America proud!

03:18.398 --> 03:20.867
[Chris] We salute you, Luke Russell.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.103
[Tiki] Here we go. Bite Force, with ease.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.573
-[Chris] Oossaa!
-[Tiki] Oossaa!

03:26.639 --> 03:27.473
[Chris] Oossaa!

03:27.540 --> 03:31.344
-Come on, Luke! Look at that.
-[Tiki] Easily.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.215
This is a 7.5-foot jump.

03:36.649 --> 03:37.483
[Chris] Oh!

03:37.550 --> 03:39.018
Nice jump, buddy.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.020
[Tiki] He's trained
in a lot of things.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.590
[Chris] Gymnastics, rock-climbing, OCR,

03:43.656 --> 03:46.226
of course football, slacklining
and cheerleading.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.595
[Tiki] He lands it!
This kid can lead a cheer.

03:48.661 --> 03:52.165
He can hold a woman over his head,
and throw her and catch her.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.466
And he's there.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.802
Easily through the Grinder,
on to Faceplant.

03:55.868 --> 03:56.769
India's here!

03:56.836 --> 03:58.838
-Our comrades.
-Oh, my God!

03:58.905 --> 04:00.139
How's your man doing?

04:00.206 --> 04:01.507
[Tiki] He is doing fantastic.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.876
-[Sarah-Jane] Yeah?
-[Tiki] Come on, USA! There he is.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.678
He grabs, and he's on easily.

04:06.179 --> 04:09.515
-[Sarah-Jane] He looks like Adam Levine.
-[Tiki] He does look like Adam Levine.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.951
[Chris] This 10-foot jump, can he do it?

04:12.018 --> 04:13.386
Oh!

04:14.220 --> 04:16.589
-[Vidyut] That's phenomenal! Phenomenal.
-[Tiki] Wow!

04:16.656 --> 04:20.927
He's lucky that he's got good abs, too,
because he landed squarely on his abs.

04:20.994 --> 04:21.894
Yeah.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.664
[Chris] USA!

04:24.731 --> 04:25.665
Oh, nice!

04:25.732 --> 04:28.735
[Tiki] Good move. He hangs on,
and gets to the last Energy Coil.

04:28.801 --> 04:30.903
[Vidyut] Sarah and I
have brought them luck, man.

04:30.970 --> 04:31.804
USA!

04:31.871 --> 04:35.074
-You brought us good karma.
-We've brought good luck, good karma.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.276
[Sarah-Jane] Deadbolts.

04:36.342 --> 04:39.112
-[Vidyut] Do you think he can do this
-[Chris] I think Luke can do it.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.347
[Tiki] He's in our Armed Forces.
He can do everything.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.782
[Sarah-Jane] I think so, too.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.285
-[Chris] Nice!
-[Tiki] It's all about racking up points.

04:46.586 --> 04:49.756
[Chris] Sarah, if he gets through the Mag
Wall, can I go on a date with you?

04:49.822 --> 04:50.990
[Sarah-Jane] Oh, man.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.893
[Tiki] You've got to get your momentum
going. Come on, Luke!

04:54.060 --> 04:56.062
[Vidyut] Oh, my God!

04:56.129 --> 04:59.565
-I am loving this man.
-Nice jump. He's building velocity.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.200
[Tiki] Here we go. Here it is.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.169
Oh, wow! He barely held that.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.537
[Vidyut] Beautiful!

05:04.604 --> 05:06.806
[Chris] How good are my chances
of getting a date now?

05:06.873 --> 05:08.474
[Tiki] Now he's coming onto... No!

05:09.642 --> 05:11.577
-Vi, you ruined it!
-Oh, my God!

05:11.644 --> 05:12.812
[Chris] What the hell?

05:13.279 --> 05:16.749
[Tiki] Every time you ask for a date,
that happens, man.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.053
-Chris, Sarah cannot be your date.
-I'm gonna go now. I'm leaving.

05:20.119 --> 05:22.522
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-But the guy was very good.

05:22.588 --> 05:25.458
-[Chris] We were so close!
-That guy is phenomenally good.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.026
Oh, he's a fantastic athlete.

05:27.093 --> 05:30.596
The Coils were tough.
I was hoping to get my feet on them.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.499
I was at least able to brace the impact
and able to hold on.

05:33.566 --> 05:36.936
My fingers were feeling it, for sure,
after the first couple of jumps.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.340
It was hard on the fingers.
But I'm ecstatic, I really am.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.077
I know the wife's proud.
I think the Air Force would be proud, too.

05:44.143 --> 05:47.180
[Tiki] Chris created bad karma
because he asked Sarah out on a date.

05:47.246 --> 05:48.448
What do you want from me?

05:48.514 --> 05:52.685
I'm out here in the middle of the Beast.
I can't ask a pretty girl out on a date?

05:52.752 --> 05:55.655
Wait until the competitor's done
or does something well,

05:55.722 --> 05:56.823
so she's in a good mood.

05:56.889 --> 05:57.824
I'm sorry, Tiki.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.026
Delson! Delson!

06:00.193 --> 06:03.129
[Chris] Delson D'Souza
is taking on the Beast right now,

06:03.196 --> 06:05.598
and he's unfortunately
another male competitor

06:05.665 --> 06:07.033
with some type of man bun.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.735
[Tiki laughs]

06:08.801 --> 06:11.037
-Hi!
-Easily on top of the Grinder.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.238
-Together...
-OK.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.474
-Delson!
-Yeah!

06:14.540 --> 06:17.777
[Tiki] At 5'5", it's a little bit of a
jump for him, but he makes it easily.

06:17.844 --> 06:18.678
[Chris] No problem.

06:19.812 --> 06:24.317
[Tiki] He's a stuntman, so he's used
to being in compromising situations.

06:24.384 --> 06:30.523
Probably, none of them match the intensity
that this Beast is gonna throw at him.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.059
Delson! Delson!

06:33.593 --> 06:35.962
Delson! Delson!

06:36.028 --> 06:39.499
[Chris] Delson, on to the Faceplant,
racking up the points now. Here we go.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.566
25 points.

06:40.633 --> 06:44.504
So he's a stuntman, as we said earlier,
and his signature move is the human flag,

06:44.570 --> 06:46.706
where he hangs off things sideways.

06:46.773 --> 06:50.910
So the Faceplant may fit in
to what he does on a regular basis.

06:50.977 --> 06:54.447
[Tiki] He's waiting here
for a little bit of time.

06:55.848 --> 06:58.551
[Chris] Pull yourself up!
Pull yourself up! Wow!

06:59.986 --> 07:04.857
-Delson, do not give up!
-Never give up, Delson!

07:04.924 --> 07:09.195
[Tiki] He's stuck in this death spin right
now. His only shot is to climb back up.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.231
-Now, his arms are getting weak.
-[Chris] Oh, there he goes.

07:12.298 --> 07:14.066
-[Tiki] He finally let go.
-I'm sorry.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.271
[Tiki] Oh, so that was the issue -
he missed.

07:18.337 --> 07:19.672
[Chris] He missed.

07:19.739 --> 07:23.810
So it was only pure grit and strength
that ever even enabled him to hold on.

07:23.876 --> 07:28.014
[Tiki] So Delson D'Souza
ends up with 30 points in Level 1.

07:28.080 --> 07:32.151
[Chris] Alright, my man Bin Fang
from China.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.586
[Tiki] He is a rock climber.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.688
He hunts wild hogs, actually.

07:36.155 --> 07:36.989
Wow!

07:39.859 --> 07:43.296
[Bin] I grew up in a small village
in Zhejiang.

07:43.696 --> 07:47.633
There are a lot of wild hogs,
and they eat our crops,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.268
like rice and corn.

07:49.735 --> 07:54.106
Every year, my friends and I
use bows and arrows

07:54.173 --> 07:57.610
to hunt the wild hogs
because otherwise they eat our crops.

07:57.677 --> 08:00.546
We stand 30 meters away

08:00.880 --> 08:02.181
and shoot them.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.884
I like adventures, but I'm timid.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.853
I'll be the champion.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.289
[klaxon sounds]

08:10.356 --> 08:12.291
[Chris] His nickname
is "The Hunting Knight".

08:12.358 --> 08:13.860
[Tiki] "The Hunting Knight".

08:13.926 --> 08:16.462
And he ran up Bite Force
like it wasn't even an issue.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.396
[Chris] Yeah.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.298
[Tiki] Let's see
how he handles the Grinder.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.634
Bin Fang is my favorite contestant.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.969
-Sure.
-He is so handsome.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.006
He's handsome, strong and smart.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.741
[cheers]

08:29.742 --> 08:30.977
[Tiki] Aggressive leap.

08:33.479 --> 08:34.947
[Chris] Wow, that was impressive.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.149
[Tiki] He almost got
to the top of the Grinder.

08:37.216 --> 08:40.453
The stronger a contestant is,
the more careful he should be.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.621
-You can do it.
-They can't make mistakes.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.360
[Chris] Now, he's coming down
the Faceplant.

08:47.426 --> 08:50.596
-[Tiki] This is not an easy jump here.
-[Chris] This is not an easy jump at all.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.798
[Tiki] He jumps, and he lands it!

08:52.865 --> 08:55.067
[Tiki and Chris] Oh, oh, oh!

08:55.134 --> 08:55.968
[Tiki] Hold on!

08:56.936 --> 08:58.971
Oh, can he get back? Yes!

08:59.038 --> 09:01.607
[Chris] There he is.
Alright, he's hugging on. He's holding.

09:04.076 --> 09:05.044
Oh, and he made it!

09:05.111 --> 09:06.178
[Tiki] Big jump there.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.848
-He's taking care of his looks.
-He is good looking.

09:08.915 --> 09:12.385
-All the Chinese contestants are handsome.
-He's fixing his hair.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.491
-[Chris] Oh, making it look easy!
-[Tiki] Another easy jump.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.092
[Chris] Alright!

09:20.560 --> 09:23.396
-[Tiki] This isn't a beauty contest, Fang.
-[Chris] You look great!

09:23.462 --> 09:26.299
He's got 45 points,
heading into the Dead Bolts.

09:26.365 --> 09:29.435
[Tiki] First one, he does with ease,
no problem.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.405
The second one, there is a Point Thruster,
and he gets it.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.140
-He got ten points.
-He did it.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.912
-It looks so easy.
-He's so handsome.

09:39.979 --> 09:44.417
[Tiki] One of the great indicators
of success in athletics is confidence.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.987
This kid is confident, man.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.623
[Chris] He's flying through
like he's "Bin" there before.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.159
[Tiki] He doesn't rush it.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.328
He's on the Mag Wall.

09:55.394 --> 09:58.564
Quickly moving around...
Those Mags fall off every two seconds.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.233
Oh, wow!

10:01.300 --> 10:02.368
[Chris] Yes! Yes! Yes!

10:02.435 --> 10:03.636
[Tiki] Can he do it?

10:04.070 --> 10:04.904
[Chris] Yeah!

10:04.971 --> 10:06.606
[Tiki] He got the last Point Thruster.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.341
[Chris] Yes! Wow!

10:08.407 --> 10:11.077
-[Tiki] Look at that!
-[Chris] Can he get through Level 1?

10:11.143 --> 10:14.113
[Tiki] He jumps, and he makes it!
Just amazing.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.015
[Chris] Wow! That was Fang-tastic.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.151
[yells] Chinese style!

10:19.752 --> 10:20.987
Yes!

10:21.053 --> 10:23.055
-He didn't break a sweat.
-He didn't.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.024
He was literally combing his hair.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.028
[Qinyi] Bin Fang, you're so good!

10:31.030 --> 10:33.766
-[Bin Gu] Enough.
-China's the best.

10:33.833 --> 10:37.236
-Our contestants are the best.
-OK, let me ask you...

10:37.737 --> 10:38.604
How do you feel?

10:38.971 --> 10:43.509
[Bin] I started off smoothly,
and I hope it goes smoothly later, too.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.212
-Nicely said.
-It definitely did.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.882
There are still three more rounds
and the grand finale.

10:50.816 --> 10:54.353
[Chris] That was a sweet run.
It looks like Bin Fang is the man to beat.

10:58.057 --> 11:01.127
Right now, we have the Italian kickboxer,
Alan Rimondi,

11:01.193 --> 11:02.495
from Bologna.

11:02.561 --> 11:03.896
[Francesco] It's Italy's turn!

11:03.963 --> 11:06.432
-[Bianca] Italy!
-Please, let's focus!

11:06.499 --> 11:11.070
-Let's get ready.
-Please, everyone, absolute silence!

11:12.405 --> 11:14.907
[Francesco] Go, Italy!

11:14.974 --> 11:17.476
-[Bianca] Come on, Alan!
-[Francesco] Go, Italy!

11:17.843 --> 11:19.345
[Bianca] Come on!

11:19.412 --> 11:21.447
[Francesco] No, Alan... Alan!

11:21.514 --> 11:25.151
[Tiki] He's having some struggles here.
I'm not sure what's going on.

11:25.217 --> 11:27.219
[Chris] See, he's struggling
a little bit here.

11:27.286 --> 11:30.056
[Francesco] Come on! Don't hesitate!

11:30.122 --> 11:33.059
[Chris] There we go. OK, Alan got there.
Alan got there. Good for you.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.628
-OK!
-Oh, Alan!

11:35.695 --> 11:38.731
You just took ten years off my life!
Go, go!

11:38.798 --> 11:41.300
[Tiki] Let's see
how he gets through this Grinder.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.070
It's all about momentum -
keeping on moving forward.

11:44.136 --> 11:46.505
When you stop and think,
you cause trouble for yourself.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.174
[Chris] I've been saying that.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.010
The longer you sit on there,
the longer you think about it,

11:51.077 --> 11:52.244
the more the Beast wins.

11:52.311 --> 11:54.613
[Francesco] Oh, dear! Go, go!

11:54.680 --> 11:57.983
[operatically] ♪ 'O sole mio ♪

11:58.050 --> 12:01.587
♪ Sta 'nfronte a te ♪

12:01.654 --> 12:04.090
♪ 'O sole mio... ♪

12:04.957 --> 12:08.594
I think Francesco thinks
he's already made it to the podium.

12:09.128 --> 12:12.031
♪ 'O sole mio... ♪

12:12.098 --> 12:13.666
Got anything we can throw at him?

12:13.733 --> 12:17.169
[Bianca] Good for you! Stay focused!

12:17.236 --> 12:20.773
-I'll throw this cockerel at him.
-[Francesco] He's reached the Faceplant.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.109
Six feet...

12:23.709 --> 12:25.978
Let's hope he lands...

12:26.879 --> 12:30.282
[Chris] France and Italy are going at it,
as Alan approaches Faceplant.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.952
This is where India's Delson D'Souza
took a snoozer.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.553
[Tiki] Let's see if he can make it.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.156
You jinxed us!

12:37.289 --> 12:39.558
Bye-bye!

12:40.025 --> 12:42.094
You're a jinx!

12:42.161 --> 12:47.032
[Chris] And the Faceplant gives another
contestant a mouth full of Beast blood.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.167
No!

12:48.601 --> 12:49.635
No!

12:50.936 --> 12:54.206
[Tiki] While Francesco,
the maniac, tries to recover,

12:54.273 --> 12:57.643
let's take a look at some highlights
from our next five competitors.

12:58.511 --> 13:03.215
Italian break-dancer, Mauro Pala,
came here hoping to slay the Beast,

13:03.282 --> 13:05.351
so he could win back his girlfriend.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.720
Oh, he hits it hard! But he holds on.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.188
Woo!

13:09.822 --> 13:12.024
[Tiki] If you make this jump,
she'll come back to you.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.526
Make this jump!

13:13.592 --> 13:15.594
[commentators groan]

13:15.694 --> 13:17.563
But this break-dancer was left...

13:17.997 --> 13:18.998
broken-hearted.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.466
At least we love each other!

13:22.101 --> 13:25.404
[Tiki] Léopold Hurbin,
a parkour expert from France...

13:25.471 --> 13:27.606
-Go, France!
-Come on, France!

13:28.007 --> 13:30.976
[Tiki] ...used his hops to make his way
on to the Mag Wall.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.812
[Chris] Now, these Mags fall off.

13:32.878 --> 13:36.382
[Tiki] Every two seconds, another one
falls off, so you've got to move quickly.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.884
He might get caught
by one of the Mags falling off.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.019
He's going too slow.

13:40.085 --> 13:42.188
-There we go!
-[Chris] And that's what happened.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.490
That Mag Wall will get you.

13:44.557 --> 13:48.260
Because you think you have a good thing,
and then you fall flat on your face.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.029
It's like my ex-girlfriend.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.631
[Tiki] Someone who is not
Chris' girlfriend,

13:52.698 --> 13:57.603
martial arts master, Amanda Cass,
came here hoping to roundhouse the Beast.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.438
Star-spangled badass right there.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.975
[Chris and Tiki, to "Star Spangled
Banner"] ♪ Amanda-ca, Amanda-ca ♪

14:03.042 --> 14:07.546
[Tiki] ♪ And slay this stupid Beast ♪

14:07.613 --> 14:08.447
[Chris] Go. Just go!

14:09.715 --> 14:11.917
[Tiki] But this black belt lost her kick.

14:11.984 --> 14:15.287
Shruti Kotwal,
India's first ever female speed skater.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.591
She was trying to be
the first to ice the Beast.

14:18.657 --> 14:20.993
[Chris] But the only problem is
the Beast isn't frozen.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.929
[Tiki] She cannot skate
on the blood of the Beast.

14:23.996 --> 14:27.700
Yeah, the speed-skaters...
They use their lower bodies more.

14:27.766 --> 14:29.034
[Sarah-Jane] Come on, Shruti!

14:29.101 --> 14:31.470
-[Chris] Come on, Shruti!
-[Tiki] And she makes it!

14:31.537 --> 14:33.239
[Chris] Come on, come on, come on!

14:34.707 --> 14:38.010
[Tiki] But without her blades,
the Beast grinded her to a halt.

14:38.077 --> 14:42.748
Spanish gym teacher, Pablo Sendra,
hoped to teach the Beast a lesson.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.584
Come on, Pablo! We're with you.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.389
[Tiki] He's in pain.
He's a little bit jacked up here, Chris.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.825
-[Chris] He could have pulled a muscle.
-[Tiki] Oh, no!

14:52.892 --> 14:54.894
-He fell!
-[Tiki] And fail!

14:54.960 --> 14:59.098
Instead, he's the third athlete
to get flunked and dunked on Faceplant.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.867
-[Chris] His shoulder popped out!
-My shoulder has popped out.

15:01.934 --> 15:05.838
That's pure emotion, and you don't know
if that's pain or him being European.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.841
[Tiki] Now, let's take a look
at the leaderboard.

15:08.908 --> 15:12.077
Bin Fang is in first with 105 points.

15:12.144 --> 15:16.582
Léopold Hurbin of France
trails in second by only 15 points.

15:16.649 --> 15:22.054
Unfortunately for India, Shruti Kotwal
is our first competitor eliminated.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.790
And with three competitors tied
at 25 points,

15:24.857 --> 15:26.592
because of the slower time,

15:26.659 --> 15:30.863
American Amanda Cass
finds herself squarely on the bubble.

15:33.399 --> 15:37.603
Grégoire Rezzonico,
23 years old from Paris, France.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.838
[Chris] Oh, look at those abs!

15:41.073 --> 15:44.209
I'm sure we have some people
pressing pause and rewind.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.912
When I take off my shirt,
I look like the melting candle

15:46.979 --> 15:48.280
from Beauty and the Beast.

15:49.148 --> 15:53.385
[Tiki] So, at this juncture,
Amanda Cass could be eliminated.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.254
Dear Lord, please.

15:55.321 --> 15:59.558
If you let this Frenchman fail right now,
like, really, just fail hard,

15:59.625 --> 16:03.495
I promise I will eat all my vegetables,
except kale - it's gross.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.664
-I don't know why you put it on earth.
-Amen.

16:06.932 --> 16:08.968
[Tiki] There he is now,
on top of the Grinder.

16:09.034 --> 16:11.070
Five points for each one of these jumps.

16:14.340 --> 16:17.576
[Sandy] I have very high hopes
for this 23-year-old athlete.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.844
He's big on obstacles.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.914
He's done 22 obstacle races
in the last year or so.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.516
-He's doing well on the Grinder...
-So smooth...

16:24.583 --> 16:26.385
[Chris] Grégoire making it look easy
so far.

16:27.553 --> 16:31.056
Grégoire can eliminate Amanda Cass
if he reaches the first Energy Coil.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.260
[cheering]

16:36.662 --> 16:37.930
[Chris] And he makes it on.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.966
[Tiki] Grégoire has knocked out
Amanda Cass, unfortunately.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.602
[Chris] You're from the USA, baby
- nothing to frown about.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.604
[Tiki] You know she's disappointed,
though.

16:46.071 --> 16:47.940
I'm confident he can make this...

16:48.007 --> 16:49.575
Oh, no!

16:49.641 --> 16:51.477
[Chris] I spoke too soon, Grégoire.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.779
-No!
-No, Grégoire!

16:54.847 --> 16:57.583
[Grégoire] I'm a bit disappointed
to be out so soon.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.418
I thought I'd get past the first one,

16:59.485 --> 17:03.122
but I was less sure about the second one
because it's further to jump.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.891
I didn't manage to grab on.
Maybe I went too quickly.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.160
Voodoo! Voodoo!

17:08.894 --> 17:10.229
Voodoo! [cackles]

17:11.329 --> 17:14.133
[Tiki] Grégoire, the world's top-rated
obstacle course racer,

17:14.199 --> 17:16.268
has made it to Level 2,

17:16.335 --> 17:18.837
putting Italy's Alan Rimondi
on the bubble.

17:18.904 --> 17:22.074
[Chris] And this guy could be
the one who knocks him out.

17:22.141 --> 17:26.011
Jian Cui of China, who's a parkour coach.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.846
And he is ready to run the Beast.

17:27.913 --> 17:28.947
And he is rocking...

17:29.014 --> 17:30.315
I fight for China!

17:30.516 --> 17:31.717
[Tiki] ...the man bun.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.085
Of course, I'll win.

17:36.188 --> 17:39.191
It was difficult
when I was growing up in the village,

17:39.258 --> 17:40.759
so I left and found work.

17:40.826 --> 17:45.030
My first job when I was 15, in Tianjin,

17:45.497 --> 17:48.434
was at a sausage factory.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.869
I worked for 12 hours every day.

17:50.936 --> 17:52.871
I didn't have a proper childhood.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.573
I worked as a teenager.

17:54.640 --> 17:59.511
When I was 19,
my friend and I moved to Beijing.

18:00.012 --> 18:03.348
We worked in a restaurant and met
someone who was learning parkour.

18:04.283 --> 18:08.220
You could say, I found hope in my life.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.722
I finally have something
I'm passionate about.

18:11.056 --> 18:15.294
After I learned parkour,
my life became more...

18:15.727 --> 18:16.695
interesting.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.364
I believe I can win.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.435
[Tiki] He is a parkour athlete.

18:23.502 --> 18:24.703
[Chris] He's very good.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.107
Jian Cui, you can do it!

18:28.173 --> 18:29.975
[cheers]

18:31.143 --> 18:33.879
[Chris] Jian "Suave",
going on to the Faceplant.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.950
[Tiki] Now, if he makes this jump, Alan
Rimondi from Italy will be eliminated.

18:38.016 --> 18:40.986
Go with the voodoo, Bianca,
my little witch!

18:41.053 --> 18:42.488
Go with the voodoo!

18:42.554 --> 18:44.123
Do the voodoo, Bianca!

18:44.857 --> 18:46.024
Do it...

18:46.091 --> 18:48.827
-[Chris] Yes!
-No! Damn it!

18:49.561 --> 18:53.332
[Chris] Rimondi from Italy
is now officially out of the race.

18:54.867 --> 18:55.901
[Tiki and Chris] Oh!

18:55.968 --> 18:57.536
Come on.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.505
-Come on!
-Come on!

18:59.571 --> 19:04.176
[Tiki] This is the longer of the two
Energy Coil jumps. This is about 12 feet.

19:04.877 --> 19:05.711
Oh, he gets it!

19:05.777 --> 19:09.948
Jian Cui, you can do it!

19:10.349 --> 19:14.286
[Tiki] At 137 pounds,
he doesn't have a lot of weight to carry.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.788
[Chris] Here's a Point Thruster
he can get for 10 points.

19:16.855 --> 19:17.956
[Tiki] And he nails it.

19:19.424 --> 19:21.193
As he goes through these Dead Bolts,

19:21.260 --> 19:24.696
you can probably expect
that he'll get through...

19:24.863 --> 19:26.565
No!

19:26.632 --> 19:28.066
[Tiki] Oh, he missed!

19:29.868 --> 19:30.869
[Bin Gu] What a pity.

19:30.969 --> 19:33.338
[Vidyut] He just missed it! Bad luck!

19:33.405 --> 19:37.743
That's too bad, but before he fell,
he pressed on the Point Thruster.

19:38.610 --> 19:39.878
[Tiki] Here's the replay.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.780
And he just...

19:41.847 --> 19:44.383
[Chris] What was that?
Do you think the man bun got in the way?

19:44.449 --> 19:47.152
[Tiki] No, I think he left
just a little bit prematurely.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.321
He didn't have enough power to make it.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.557
[Chris] Alright, let's check out
the leaderboard.

19:51.623 --> 19:54.860
[Tiki] And with that,
Jian Cui secures a spot in Level 2

19:54.927 --> 19:59.731
and places Pablo Sendra on the bubble,
with one last athlete ready to run.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.935
[Chris] Now, it's two Spaniards,
mano y womano.

20:03.001 --> 20:06.872
She can knock her countryman,
Pablo Sendra, out of the competition.

20:06.939 --> 20:11.410
First, she needs to get past Faceplant,
where four athletes have fallen tonight.

20:11.476 --> 20:14.112
Only one Spaniard
is going to make it through.

20:14.179 --> 20:15.581
Come on, Alejandra!

20:15.647 --> 20:18.750
-Come on, Alejandra! Go, go!
-Go, Spain!

20:18.817 --> 20:20.586
[Paula] This girl has to give it her all.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.956
[Tiki] Alejandra is
an obstacle course racing enthusiast.

20:24.022 --> 20:28.126
At the European Championships
in 2016, she finished third.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.394
[Chris] OK.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.732
We almost had a slip up, right there.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.801
She regained her composure.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.070
Pull yourself up, pull yourself up!

20:38.136 --> 20:39.304
And she got it!

20:39.371 --> 20:42.474
[Tiki] Time and time again,
we've seen our shorter athletes

20:42.541 --> 20:43.942
fail at this jump.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.677
[Chris] Well, let's see if she can do it.

20:46.211 --> 20:47.246
[Tiki] Here she is.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.681
[Chris] And she got it!

20:49.748 --> 20:52.417
Good for you, girl!
Making it look easy so far.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.120
-[Tiki] Alejandra!
-[Chris] Come on!

20:55.921 --> 20:58.056
[Tiki] Five points
for each one of these jumps.

20:59.157 --> 21:00.926
-[Chris] There it is!
-[Tiki] She nails it!

21:00.993 --> 21:02.194
[Chris] Anxiously waiting,

21:02.261 --> 21:05.864
to see if she will knock
her fellow Spaniard out of the race.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.700
She is 36 years old.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.570
Did you know she also played rugby
when she was a teenager?

21:11.637 --> 21:14.339
-Oh, wow.
-And she practices rock climbing.

21:14.806 --> 21:18.910
[Tiki] Now, all she has to do
is secure herself on this chain,

21:18.977 --> 21:21.146
and she'll be moving on to Level 2.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.447
Come on!

21:22.514 --> 21:23.949
Come on! Hold on!

21:24.016 --> 21:26.718
-Hold on tight, Alejandra!
-Stay calm. Stay calm.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.655
-Hold on tight! Be confident!
-You've got this.

21:29.721 --> 21:30.889
[Tiki] Man, she got it!

21:30.956 --> 21:32.958
[cheers]

21:34.259 --> 21:36.495
[Tiki] She has knocked out
her country mate.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.598
Pablo Sendra is going home.

21:39.665 --> 21:42.501
This 10-foot jump,
we have not seen a female...

21:43.669 --> 21:47.306
No! She fell like a puppet.
Such a shame!

21:47.372 --> 21:51.009
-Guys, she's in Level 2. Don't worry.
-Yes. It's good.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.445
-Well done! Well done!
-Thank you!

21:53.512 --> 21:54.980
The rope is very slippery.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.517
I barely made it, but I'm very happy.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.419
[Tiki] That's just a hard jump -

22:00.485 --> 22:04.056
the height and length
that you have to get to make that jump.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.490
She just couldn't get it done.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.793
[Paula] What a champ!
She has beaten many men today.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.961
-[Saúl] Yes, that's true.
-She got really far.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.797
We're very proud of you, Alejandra!

22:11.863 --> 22:14.299
Congratulations, Alejandra De Castro,

22:14.366 --> 22:16.301
for making it through to Level 2.

22:16.368 --> 22:19.805
And that does it for Level 1.
Let's take a look at our leaderboard.

22:19.871 --> 22:23.075
Three athletes are tied
with 35 points each,

22:23.141 --> 22:25.911
so to break the tie,
we're gonna have to rank them by time.

22:25.977 --> 22:29.481
[Tiki] Look, each country will have
at least one person representing them

22:29.548 --> 22:30.482
in Level 2.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.617
France and China have two.

22:32.684 --> 22:38.156
[Chris] Bin Fang absolutely "Bin-ed
the Fang" out of every competitor here.

22:38.223 --> 22:41.493
He is safely in first with 105 points,

22:41.560 --> 22:44.296
cruising through Level 1.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.398
[Tiki] It's time to get to Level 2.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.467
Ultimate Beastmaster!

22:53.138 --> 22:55.640
[Chris] Alright, here we go with Level 2.

22:55.707 --> 22:59.978
The Chinese team, they're studying
each athlete like a couple of scholars,

23:00.045 --> 23:02.114
looking for any weakness they can exploit.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.716
Well, you're not gonna get me
with that finger trap.

23:04.783 --> 23:09.421
Once they go up,
they don't have a clear goal,

23:09.721 --> 23:13.892
and they don't really understand
the obstacle course.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.995
I think it won't be a problem for us.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.132
[Tiki] Jian Cui
talking some serious smack.

23:20.198 --> 23:24.169
But remember, he wasn't always
this confident before discovering parkour.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.138
It really turned his life around.

23:30.442 --> 23:34.746
After I became successful
in my parkour career

23:34.813 --> 23:38.784
and I learnt a lot of different movements,

23:38.850 --> 23:43.522
I received offers
for TV shows and commercials.

23:43.955 --> 23:46.858
After that, I was even offered
roles in movies.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.327
Parkour changed my life completely.

23:49.394 --> 23:54.399
I'm really thankful
that I get to represent China.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.442
[klaxon sounds]

24:03.508 --> 24:07.345
[Tiki] Jian Cui on to Level 2
and up the Spinal Ascent.

24:07.512 --> 24:11.149
-Jian Cui, you can do it!
-Jian Cui, you can do it!

24:12.217 --> 24:15.253
[Tiki] Jian Cui. He's small, man.
He's only 5'6".

24:15.320 --> 24:19.524
But I guess that short stature
makes him explosive.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.261
Deftly climbing the Spinal Ascent.

24:23.929 --> 24:29.935
It looks like it's too easy for him.
Now, he's moving on to the next obstacle.

24:32.871 --> 24:37.175
[Chris] Jian Cui having some Fun Cui,
on the Spinal Descent right now.

24:37.242 --> 24:40.011
Doing well so far, on Level 2.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.981
[Tiki] As you get down to the bottom
of the Spinal Descent,

24:43.048 --> 24:47.486
you see those cords get much more sparse,
and much harder.

24:48.019 --> 24:51.890
He is going for a Point Thruster,
the first of four on the course.

24:51.957 --> 24:55.494
-It's important to choose the right ropes.
-Yes, that one.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.628
Go!

24:56.928 --> 25:01.700
-Go! Kick it.
-Stay focused.

25:03.301 --> 25:06.938
[Tiki] He finally kicks it,
and gets back on to the Stomach Churn.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.742
He's gonna try to make his way through
the rest of the belly of the Beast.

25:10.809 --> 25:15.313
-Don't doubt yourself. Just jump!
-He's so fast. Go, Jian Cui!

25:15.780 --> 25:19.417
[Tiki] This last Stomach Churn wheel
is all about timing.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.521
And he lands on the last
of the Stomach Churns.

25:22.587 --> 25:26.124
[Chris] Jian Cui actually used to work
in a meat factory, processing the meat.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.660
So thanks for the clogged arteries,
Jian Cui.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.830
[Tiki] The most important thing,
as we talk about clogged arteries,

25:31.897 --> 25:35.066
is getting up this Digestive Track,
as quickly as possible.

25:35.133 --> 25:38.970
Digestive Track falls down into the blood
of the Beast, so if you're not quick,

25:39.037 --> 25:40.872
you've got to do it at a high level.

25:40.939 --> 25:41.940
Can he make the jump?

25:42.007 --> 25:45.110
-He does! On to the Dreadmill.
-[Chris] On to the second Dreadmill.

25:45.176 --> 25:48.613
[Tiki] Man, this dude's like a little
rabbit flying through this course.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.081
[Chris] Yeah, he's hopping off.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.519
-[Tiki] My God! What is he doing?
-[Chris] Almost fell off Chain Reaction.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.021
[Tiki] Jian Cui!

25:56.488 --> 25:59.057
Take a break! Rest for a while!

25:59.124 --> 26:01.159
[Tiki] Look at the replay.
What did he do?

26:01.226 --> 26:03.094
[Chris] Let's see.
He went too far to the left.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.797
[Tiki] Wow, good thing
he's got a strong grip.

26:06.364 --> 26:08.033
That's parkour for you.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.636
Now, on to the Chain Reaction.

26:11.703 --> 26:14.839
Being lighter,
he should actually have an advantage here,

26:15.574 --> 26:18.643
as he has to swing back and forth
from chain to chain.

26:24.616 --> 26:28.553
[Chris] He's a stunt actor, so I'm sure
that he's done stuff like this before.

26:28.620 --> 26:34.292
I have a feeling that Jian can, at least,
get to the Vertabrace.

26:34.626 --> 26:37.028
-[Tiki] We'll see.
-[Chris] He's a little low though, now.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.230
-He's a little low.
-[Tiki] He is low.

26:40.198 --> 26:42.167
You've got to pull yourself up and back.

26:42.233 --> 26:45.637
He's trying to elevate himself
and get some momentum.

26:45.704 --> 26:49.240
-He's trying to get the momentum.
-Yeah, he might be stuck here.

26:49.307 --> 26:52.344
[Chris] Yeah, looks like more importantly,
he's faced the wrong way.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.713
And he backflips into the Beast's blood.

26:54.879 --> 26:55.947
Jian Cui gave up.

26:56.881 --> 26:58.283
-Why?
-Jian Cui gave up.

26:59.851 --> 27:00.685
Why?

27:01.486 --> 27:03.955
My arms are tired...

27:04.656 --> 27:06.591
because the middle part was too long,

27:07.292 --> 27:09.594
and it was starting to hurt.

27:11.329 --> 27:15.100
[Tiki] Jian Cui, leading the way
so far with 160 points.

27:15.166 --> 27:18.236
[Chris] Next up, we have American,
Luke Russell.

27:21.106 --> 27:24.476
I'm 28 years old and currently,
an active duty Air Force medic,

27:24.542 --> 27:27.145
stationed out at Nellis Air Force Base
in Las Vegas.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.883
You get pretty quick,
but pretty extensive, training.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.753
My father served in the Navy
for over 24 years

27:34.819 --> 27:38.690
and both grandparents in the Korean War
and World War II, and everything.

27:38.757 --> 27:41.760
Just seeing that selflessness
and that respect

27:41.826 --> 27:43.495
and character that goes with it,

27:43.561 --> 27:45.997
definitely played a big part
in me joining.

27:46.064 --> 27:49.701
I hope I represent well. I'll certainly
be giving it my best out there.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.605
[Chris] My dad said, never trust a man
with two first names.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.675
But, he's also an Air Force medic,
so I have to overrule my dad.

27:56.741 --> 27:58.109
[Tiki] Yes, Dad, you're wrong.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.646
So salute to you, Luke Russell,

28:01.713 --> 28:03.748
as he makes his way up Spinal Ascent.

28:03.815 --> 28:08.053
He started off this level with 75 points.
He's currently in third.

28:08.520 --> 28:13.525
Putting lots of contemplation
into this next jump in Spinal Ascent.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.193
Again, we talk about time -

28:15.694 --> 28:19.297
it's not of paramount importance,
but it is important.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.134
[Chris] Alright, Luke's doing well.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.904
[Tiki] Up to the top of Spinal Ascent.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.006
And he made it.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.943
And again, he is our only hope
for Team USA.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.545
[Chris] You've got to get through.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.449
Luke competing with Stride Rites,
it looks like.

28:37.515 --> 28:40.552
I don't know why he's wearing
the same sneakers as my mother,

28:40.618 --> 28:42.253
but he's doing a very good job.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.022
[Tiki] Stop clowning the Air Force man.

28:44.522 --> 28:47.058
One hundred points,
Luke Russell has at this point,

28:47.125 --> 28:50.361
as he makes his way
through and down Spinal Descent.

28:50.428 --> 28:54.232
When he gets to the bottom, he's got to
decide if he goes for the Point Thruster.

28:55.166 --> 28:58.103
Most of these competitors
are kicking it with their foot.

28:58.169 --> 29:02.407
He nails it!
Ten extra points for Luke Russell.

29:02.474 --> 29:03.742
[Chris] Come on, Luke!

29:04.609 --> 29:06.010
[cheering]

29:07.879 --> 29:10.415
[Chris] Luke! And he made it.
Luke, good for you!

29:10.482 --> 29:12.117
[Tiki] This is the hardest of the jumps.

29:12.984 --> 29:14.452
-[Chris] Oh!
-[Tiki] Oh, wow!

29:14.519 --> 29:15.887
Look at that!

29:16.855 --> 29:18.623
Little steps! Stand up!

29:20.558 --> 29:22.794
-[Tiki] As he jumps to the final...
-[Chris] He jumps!

29:22.861 --> 29:24.129
[Tiki] ...of the Churns.

29:25.163 --> 29:27.398
The Digestive Track is next.

29:28.733 --> 29:31.936
You can't take for granted
the first steps.

29:32.003 --> 29:33.805
Here he goes, up the Digestive Track.

29:33.872 --> 29:36.274
The most important thing
is not to fall...

29:36.341 --> 29:38.443
-[Chris] Come on, Luke!
-[Tiki] At the beginning!

29:38.510 --> 29:41.846
Oh, Luke! If he'd had cooler shoes...

29:41.913 --> 29:42.747
[Chris] Yes!

29:42.814 --> 29:44.949
[Tiki] ...maybe Luke
could have gone farther.

29:45.016 --> 29:46.718
[Chris] It must be the shoes!

29:46.785 --> 29:52.023
[Tiki] But he picks up 45 points,
which leaves him with 130 points,

29:52.090 --> 29:53.391
through Level 2.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.160
This is for you, Luke!

29:55.226 --> 29:56.828
-What is that, an eagle?
-Yes!

29:56.895 --> 29:58.897
Yeah, you're bald,
so it works for you.

30:02.801 --> 30:07.705
[Chris] Alright, next up, we have
French parkour athlete, Léopold Hurbin.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.175
[Léopold] I'm a traceur.

30:10.241 --> 30:13.678
Parkour is something that has developed
mainly in urban areas.

30:13.745 --> 30:18.082
And I think that trees bring something
to the sport that concrete doesn't.

30:18.149 --> 30:20.118
I made a video called Humanzee

30:20.185 --> 30:23.988
in which I move around in natural areas,

30:24.055 --> 30:27.725
inspired by the way monkeys move,
as well as other animals.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.395
For me, parkour is a way for us

30:30.461 --> 30:33.698
to take back control
of our lost instincts.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.070
[cheering]

30:39.137 --> 30:41.940
[Chris] Léopold calls himself
the "Humanzee".

30:42.006 --> 30:43.474
I guess, like the chimpanzee?

30:43.541 --> 30:48.079
[Tiki] He's chimpanzee-ing down Spinal
Descent pretty rapidly, falling through.

30:48.146 --> 30:50.849
But he puts himself
on the wrong side of the cords.

30:50.915 --> 30:53.184
He grabs it with his teeth.
What's he doing?

30:53.251 --> 30:56.187
[Chris] He bit it like the human
chimpanzee he calls himself.

30:56.254 --> 30:58.089
[Tiki] Léopold Hurbin,

30:58.156 --> 31:01.092
going for the Point Thruster -
one of four.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.096
Come on, Léopold.
You're representing France!

31:05.163 --> 31:06.064
You can do it...

31:07.165 --> 31:09.367
[Sandy] Ten more points for you, Léo.

31:09.434 --> 31:12.136
[Tiki] Very easily up
to the first Stomach Churn.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.506
Again, this is a cumulative score contest,

31:15.573 --> 31:17.508
so every point matters.

31:17.575 --> 31:18.476
[Chris] There you go.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.613
[Tiki] Each one of these jumps
is five points.

31:21.679 --> 31:22.814
[Chris] Oh, no!

31:22.881 --> 31:24.983
-[Tiki] He can't even make it!
-[Chris] He can't.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.618
You can't bite that Léopold.

31:26.684 --> 31:29.320
Oh, no! He jumped too close to the edge!

31:30.355 --> 31:32.390
What a turn of events!

31:32.457 --> 31:35.760
-Let's bring them some salami!
-For the baguette!

31:35.827 --> 31:39.931
The Italians will be here
any moment to gloat.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.400
I don't want them here.
Here they come...

31:43.034 --> 31:46.070
They really had high hopes
for this athlete!

31:46.137 --> 31:46.971
Thank you.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.307
-For the baguette, for the baguette.
-Thanks.

31:49.374 --> 31:53.511
It's for you, because you have to eat
baguette with salami.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.981
The Italians are already
bothering the French. Take a look.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.083
-Thank you, thank you.
-Thank you so much!

31:59.150 --> 32:00.652
Thank you, my friends.

32:00.718 --> 32:02.453
-We love you so much. Bye-bye.
-Bye.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.556
-I think they were being very...
-...sarcastic.

32:05.623 --> 32:06.958
Sarcastic.

32:09.193 --> 32:11.429
[Chris] Next up from China, Bin Fang.

32:11.496 --> 32:14.565
Bin Fang, he "Bin-ed the Fang"
out of the Beast in Level 1.

32:14.632 --> 32:15.967
[Tiki] We like Bin Fang.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.336
He's the most handsome
of our Chinese team.

32:19.304 --> 32:20.138
Yes.

32:23.741 --> 32:26.411
I train almost six days a week.

32:26.477 --> 32:30.014
I do a lot of different
training exercises,

32:30.081 --> 32:31.182
so I'm an all-rounder.

32:31.249 --> 32:34.319
I do rock climbing, parkour and others.

32:34.385 --> 32:38.723
Every morning, I wear an elevation mask

32:38.790 --> 32:44.429
to simulate breathing
at an altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 meters.

32:44.929 --> 32:48.800
There's almost no oxygen for the lungs.
It's excruciating.

32:49.267 --> 32:51.703
Normally,
a person wouldn't be able to survive.

32:52.503 --> 32:54.305
I will beat every other contestant.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.441
I will win this competition.

33:00.278 --> 33:04.082
[Chris] Bin Fang coming through... Whoa!
He's just falling through Spinal Descent.

33:04.349 --> 33:11.222
Nice. Bin Fang is completing
the Spinal Descent quickly.

33:11.723 --> 33:15.593
[Tiki] Bin is going to go
for the very first of our Point Thrusters.

33:19.630 --> 33:20.531
And he nails it!

33:20.598 --> 33:24.302
Nicely done. Now, he has 145 points.

33:24.369 --> 33:26.471
He's definitely going to the next level.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.840
Let's see how far
he can get ahead of the others.

33:30.041 --> 33:31.042
[Tiki] Wow!

33:31.109 --> 33:33.611
-Wow, look at that!
-[Chris] With some quickness!

33:34.612 --> 33:37.148
-China!
-Chinese guy!

33:37.515 --> 33:38.616
Whoa!

33:38.683 --> 33:40.918
-Wow!
-This guy is good. Bin Fang is good.

33:40.985 --> 33:41.819
So cool!

33:41.886 --> 33:43.654
-Chinese Kung Fu.
-Wow!

33:43.721 --> 33:46.491
[Tiki] Bin Fang
is taking on Digestive Track,

33:46.557 --> 33:50.161
and gets his head a little stuck,
cockeyed there, in the Digestive Track.

33:50.228 --> 33:53.998
You've got to move with quickness
up the Digestive Track. Don't slide back!

33:54.065 --> 33:55.466
-He's sliding back.
-[Qinyi] No!

33:55.533 --> 33:58.870
[Tiki] As the Digestive Track
falls down into the blood of the Beast,

33:58.936 --> 34:00.905
you put yourself at a disadvantage.

34:00.972 --> 34:04.375
[Chris] Oh, my God. Bin Fang! Come on,
Bin! Get the Fang out of there!

34:04.442 --> 34:06.911
-Get the Fang out of there!
-[Tiki] You've got to jump now!

34:06.978 --> 34:10.415
Oh, what an epic leap by Bin Fang!

34:10.481 --> 34:12.083
That was unbelievable.

34:12.315 --> 34:16.219
Goodness! Everyone's so excited.
That was so close.

34:16.387 --> 34:21.559
[Tiki] If he waits two seconds later,
he has no chance to make that jump.

34:21.626 --> 34:24.161
[Chris] He jumped from halfway inside
the Digestive Track.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.464
[Tiki] Wow, let's see that on replay.

34:27.364 --> 34:31.002
Bin Fang, struggling up
the Digestive Track.

34:31.069 --> 34:35.106
Got to the top and had to leap for glory,
and he made it.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.210
[Chris] Now, he's at Chain Reaction.
Bin making it look easy.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.945
-No hesitation.
-You can do it.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.246
-Hang on.
-Stay focused.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.614
-Slowly.
-Stay focused.

34:44.681 --> 34:47.618
[Tiki] Bin Fang is struggling, though,
on the Chain Reaction here.

34:47.685 --> 34:49.687
[Chris] Swinging through Chain Reaction,

34:49.754 --> 34:52.523
using both chains to pull himself up.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.992
He's got some trouble.
He's got to get himself up.

34:55.059 --> 34:56.694
[Tiki] Yeah, he's a little bit low.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.030
Those are 200 pounds, those Vertabraces.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.765
You can see how low he is.

35:01.399 --> 35:03.034
He's trying to climb... Oh!

35:03.101 --> 35:05.069
-Oh, he almost got it!
-[Chris] If he had--

35:05.136 --> 35:07.605
[Tiki] He's right there.
I think he's gonna swing back...

35:07.672 --> 35:09.507
[Chris] He was lacking the toe strength.

35:10.241 --> 35:12.143
[Tiki] His timing is just off.

35:14.545 --> 35:15.613
[Chris] Come on, Bin!

35:15.680 --> 35:17.081
[Tiki] We saw this earlier,

35:17.148 --> 35:18.649
with our Chinese competitor.

35:18.716 --> 35:21.752
[Chris] Bin Fang-ing
through the air right now,

35:21.819 --> 35:24.088
and he finally concedes.

35:25.523 --> 35:28.092
-[Qinyi] What a pity.
-[Bin Gu] What a heart-pounding moment!

35:28.159 --> 35:31.395
But he did great. He has 200 points.
He's currently in first place.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.565
[Chris] Bin Fang has got it going on in
here, in Level 2.

35:34.632 --> 35:37.735
[Tiki] It's gonna take some next-level
skills to top that.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.805
[Chris] The Indian people are chanting.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.507
[mimicking the Indian team]

35:43.207 --> 35:47.445
[Tiki] Team India is cheering on their man
in Mumbai fashion.

35:49.247 --> 35:54.585
-Delson, Delson!
-Delson, Delson!

35:54.652 --> 35:57.989
[Chris] Delson barely made it into
Level 2. He's actually in eighth place.

35:58.055 --> 35:59.824
He's got to score some points here.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.927
[Tiki] Yeah, there's lots of distance
he's got to make up.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.997
[siren wails]

36:06.063 --> 36:09.400
[Chris] Wow, the Indian hosts
don't know how to use a blow horn.

36:12.870 --> 36:16.774
[Tiki] Delson very delicately
making his way down Spinal Descent.

36:17.275 --> 36:20.077
Do you think he'll make an effort
for the Point Thruster?

36:20.645 --> 36:22.079
He's gonna try.

36:25.283 --> 36:28.252
-Let's see. OK--
-[Chris] Oh, Delson D'Souza.

36:28.319 --> 36:30.054
[Tiki] Odd kick. He missed twice. Can he--

36:30.121 --> 36:31.889
-He finally does it.
-[Chris] There he is.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.257
[Tiki] He's got to get back.

36:33.324 --> 36:34.292
[Tiki] And he does.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.828
[Chris] And getting that Point Thruster, I
think, was the right "D'Souz-sion".

36:37.895 --> 36:42.466
[Tiki] I agree.
10 additional points for Delson D'Souza.

36:43.401 --> 36:44.468
And he made it!

36:44.535 --> 36:47.238
Each one of these jumps and lands

36:47.305 --> 36:48.506
is five points.

36:48.573 --> 36:51.642
-[Chris] He's rubbing his thighs.
-[Tiki] Looks like he banged it.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.878
[Chris] He banged his thigh.
You hate a thigh bang.

36:57.114 --> 36:59.984
[Tiki] He's trying to get his bearings.
He's getting spun around.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.620
It looks like he can't
get his bearings right.

37:02.687 --> 37:05.590
He's dizzy right now.
He's closing his eyes.

37:05.656 --> 37:08.159
[Chris] See, but this is what
the Stomach Churn does.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.894
It disorientates you.

37:10.428 --> 37:11.796
Just jump.

37:11.862 --> 37:14.165
Just jump, jump, jump! Please jump.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.101
If you spin too much, you'll spin forever.
Take a leap.

37:17.168 --> 37:19.437
-[Chris] Come on. You have to jump!
-[Tiki] There...

37:20.838 --> 37:21.672
[Chris] Delson!

37:21.739 --> 37:23.941
Oh, man!

37:24.008 --> 37:26.377
His knee hurts and he's also dizzy.

37:26.444 --> 37:29.680
[Tiki] His problem was,
he spent so much time spinning.

37:29.747 --> 37:30.982
[Chris] That's what happens.

37:31.048 --> 37:34.352
[Tiki] You really can't locate
that next Stomach Churn.

37:35.219 --> 37:37.822
[Chris] He is on the bubble right now
with 75 points,

37:37.888 --> 37:41.859
with three competitors left to go,
so let's see if he can hang on.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.598
[cheering]

37:49.600 --> 37:54.071
[Tiki] Alright, up next we have
Alejandra De Castro from Spain.

37:54.138 --> 37:55.873
She currently has 35 points.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.541
Now, she'll need to reach 80

37:57.608 --> 38:01.445
to knock out India's Delson D'Souza
from this competition.

38:01.512 --> 38:03.047
Alejandra's got it going on.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.049
She's an accomplished OCR racer.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.886
She was ranked ninth in the world at
last year's OCR Championships in Toronto.

38:08.953 --> 38:09.787
So far so good.

38:09.854 --> 38:12.923
Watch her go, as she climbs
onto the Beast's dorsal spine!

38:12.990 --> 38:14.925
Great pace. Go, Alejandra! Come on!

38:14.992 --> 38:18.396
[Tiki] She's only 5'4",
so this jump has height.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.930
Let's see if she can pull herself up.

38:19.997 --> 38:20.931
[Chris] Up, up, up!

38:20.998 --> 38:23.567
Wow, she used momentum
to get herself up there.

38:23.634 --> 38:24.602
[Tiki] That was great.

38:24.669 --> 38:27.104
-Bravo! Bravo!
-Great!

38:27.171 --> 38:28.506
[Tiki] See if she can do it again.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.411
Use your swinging powers
and upper-body strength!

38:33.744 --> 38:36.414
-She hooks her leg.
-[Paula] Yes, that's it. One more time.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.816
-[Tiki] Pull with your hamstring.
-[Chris] Pull up!

38:38.883 --> 38:42.019
[Tiki] She's on the precipice.
Can she make it?

38:42.086 --> 38:45.156
-[Chris] Crowd behind her!
-[Tiki] One more inch, and there she is.

38:45.222 --> 38:48.259
-Perfect! Awesome!
-Great!

38:48.326 --> 38:49.660
[Chris] One more jump,

38:49.994 --> 38:52.263
and she makes it to Spinal Descent.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.598
-Come on!
-Very good!

38:54.665 --> 38:57.101
-Come on, Alejandra! Hold on tight!
-Great!

38:57.635 --> 39:00.371
[Tiki] Alejandra making her way
down Spinal Descent.

39:00.438 --> 39:03.307
[Chris] Alejandra is Spain's only hope
to move on to Level 3 -

39:03.374 --> 39:04.575
the only one they've got.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.477
[Tiki] The only one they've got,

39:06.544 --> 39:09.347
as the Chinese have dominated,

39:09.413 --> 39:10.481
so far.

39:13.551 --> 39:17.121
As she comes out of Spinal Descent here,
she adds five more points,

39:17.621 --> 39:21.192
giving her 30 for Level 2.

39:21.258 --> 39:24.362
-She's going for the Point Thruster.
-[Chris] Wow.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.230
And this is risky.

39:26.931 --> 39:29.467
-[Paula] Hold on tight!
-[Saúl] Hold on tight! Come on!

39:29.834 --> 39:32.536
-[Paula] Come on! You can do it!
-[Saúl] Hold on tight!

39:32.837 --> 39:35.673
-[Tiki] Gets the Point Thruster!
-[Chris] But now her foot is wet.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.776
-Her foot is wet.
-[Tiki] Oh, she makes it!

39:39.210 --> 39:42.012
-Wow, what a recovery!
-[Chris] Oh, my God!

39:42.079 --> 39:43.547
That was amazing!

39:43.614 --> 39:46.350
[Tiki] Now she's got to dry her feet
and make a steady jump.

39:46.417 --> 39:47.818
[Chris] Come on, Alejandra!

39:48.819 --> 39:50.588
[Tiki] That ties her with Delson.

39:50.654 --> 39:51.789
If she makes this jump,

39:52.256 --> 39:55.960
Delson D'Souza will be knocked out
of the competition.

39:57.495 --> 40:00.097
Oh, she hangs...
Does she nail it? She nails it on!

40:00.164 --> 40:03.234
-Alright! Good!
-Awesome!

40:04.635 --> 40:07.304
[Tiki] Delson has been knocked out.

40:07.371 --> 40:09.473
She knocked India out!

40:09.540 --> 40:11.976
[Tiki] Spain keeps a competitor!

40:13.110 --> 40:15.312
-No!
-Damn it!

40:16.046 --> 40:17.047
[groans]

40:18.516 --> 40:20.351
We celebrated too soon.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.752
Good. It was great.

40:22.453 --> 40:25.956
It's really annoying that I fell there,
but, well...

40:26.724 --> 40:28.759
I should have just clung on
with my teeth.

40:29.727 --> 40:35.266
[Tiki] Now, with 80 points,
she replaces Delson,

40:35.332 --> 40:38.669
and is sitting on the bubble,
with two competitors to go.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.108
Then she disrobes.
Look at the abs on that woman!

40:44.175 --> 40:45.509
[Chris] Wow!

40:45.709 --> 40:47.478
[Tiki] Do some crunches here...

40:48.012 --> 40:49.213
[straining]

40:49.280 --> 40:51.649
-Yeah, I feel better about myself now.
-I don't.

40:52.583 --> 40:56.720
[Tiki] I imagine Bianca and Francesco
are feeling pretty good about themselves,

40:56.787 --> 40:59.957
because their man, Mauro,
is making his way down Spinal Descent.

41:00.558 --> 41:02.326
It's Mauro's turn!

41:02.393 --> 41:04.462
Let's forget about everything else.

41:04.528 --> 41:06.597
The Italian athlete is up.

41:06.664 --> 41:11.402
[Tiki] He is in this competition
for one reason and one reason only:

41:11.469 --> 41:14.138
to win back his girlfriend.

41:14.605 --> 41:17.541
[Chris] Thirteen years, they were dating,
and then she dumped him.

41:17.608 --> 41:20.244
He said, "I'll win the Beastmaster
and get you back,"

41:20.311 --> 41:22.947
and she said, "Well, I'm married now."

41:23.013 --> 41:23.948
[Tiki laughs]

41:24.415 --> 41:26.083
[Tiki] He's going for the Thruster.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.486
-Come on, Mauro!
-With your toes!

41:28.552 --> 41:30.521
Yes!

41:30.955 --> 41:33.491
-[Francesco] That's it! With his toes!
-[Bianca] Very good!

41:33.557 --> 41:35.326
[Tiki] That's 10 bonus points.

41:35.392 --> 41:38.996
He's got one more jump
to tie himself with Alejandra.

41:39.864 --> 41:41.232
[crowd applauding]

41:44.802 --> 41:47.905
[Tiki] One jump.
Oh, that was not a very good...

41:47.972 --> 41:49.607
[commentators groan]

41:49.673 --> 41:53.744
-[Chris] And a flair for the dramatic...
-[Tiki] Alejandra hangs on.

41:53.811 --> 41:58.015
Mauro! We see it as he tries to jump
on to the Stomach Churn.

41:58.082 --> 42:02.486
-[Chris] And he tries...
-[Tiki] With the flashy backflip.

42:03.454 --> 42:04.889
I'm a bit disappointed.

42:05.289 --> 42:08.626
I thought I could do better.

42:09.226 --> 42:13.230
But the distances are not short.

42:15.132 --> 42:19.336
[Tiki] It all comes down
to France versus Spain.

42:20.004 --> 42:25.242
Alejandra De Castro is holding on
to that fifth spot with 80 points.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.978
[Chris] But if Grégoire gets through
most of Stomach Churn,

42:28.045 --> 42:29.980
he'll knock her out of the competition.

42:30.047 --> 42:33.751
-Come on, Grégoire!
-Go, Grégoire!

42:33.817 --> 42:34.785
Let's go!

42:34.852 --> 42:39.557
[Tiki] Grégoire, who failed
on his first Energy Coil jump in Level 1,

42:39.623 --> 42:43.394
is effectively making his way
up Spinal Ascent.

42:46.463 --> 42:49.567
-You can do it, Grégoire. There you go!
-It's going well...

42:50.901 --> 42:54.438
[Tiki] One more leap here
and he'll have himself 25 points.

42:55.773 --> 42:57.708
-[Chris] He made it.
-[Tiki] Sixty points now.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.177
Twenty more to catch Alejandra.

43:01.812 --> 43:04.048
Spinal Descent right in front of him,

43:04.114 --> 43:05.182
and a Point Thruster

43:05.683 --> 43:07.284
at the bottom of Spinal Descent -

43:07.351 --> 43:09.820
an opportunity for 15 points.

43:09.887 --> 43:13.857
Again, 20 more points he needs
to tie Alejandra.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.531
[Chris] Let's see what he decides.
Does he go for the Point Thruster?

43:20.731 --> 43:24.068
-[Gilles] He has to get the Thruster.
-Yes, he needs the extra 10 points.

43:24.134 --> 43:25.669
Come on, Grégoire!

43:26.170 --> 43:27.938
[Tiki] Can he get it? He does get it.

43:28.005 --> 43:31.141
-There you go. Come on, Grégoire!
-Yes, that's it!

43:31.508 --> 43:35.045
-[Tiki] And back on the Stomach Churn.
-[Chris] Alright.

43:35.512 --> 43:38.949
[Tiki] One more jump, and he ties himself
with Alejandra De Castro.

43:41.251 --> 43:44.722
He makes it.
He is now tied with Alejandra de Castro.

43:45.723 --> 43:48.425
If he lands this one, Spain is out.

43:49.893 --> 43:52.830
Spain is officially out!

43:52.896 --> 43:54.264
[Chris] Adiós, España!

43:54.331 --> 43:56.200
[commentators groan]

43:56.266 --> 43:57.801
Did he hurt his front teeth?

43:57.868 --> 44:00.137
Does he still have his teeth?

44:00.204 --> 44:02.272
-He's got... three teeth left.
-No teeth!

44:02.339 --> 44:03.974
[Tiki] Let's watch this in replay.

44:04.041 --> 44:07.177
He just never got himself situated.

44:08.846 --> 44:10.714
[Chris, in French accent]
That hurt my face!

44:11.949 --> 44:14.518
-[Tiki] See this in slow-mo.
-[Chris] Grégoire!

44:14.585 --> 44:18.722
[Tiki] He tried to use the momentum
of that spinning Stomach Churn,

44:18.789 --> 44:20.190
to propel him.

44:21.025 --> 44:24.294
[Chris] But his face seems OK.
Well, it's a little dented on the left.

44:26.430 --> 44:27.564
[Grégoire] I don't know...

44:29.400 --> 44:31.568
I rushed it.

44:33.303 --> 44:35.539
I don't know... I had a weird feeling.

44:36.407 --> 44:37.941
I don't know why.

44:38.008 --> 44:39.810
Grégoire... That was a faceplant.

44:39.877 --> 44:41.912
You're happy he hit his face like that?

44:41.979 --> 44:43.647
Yeah, the Italians are happy.

44:43.714 --> 44:45.816
-Hater.
-Hater.

44:45.883 --> 44:49.553
[Tiki] After Level 2,
Bin Fang leads the way with 200 points.

44:49.620 --> 44:52.690
Jian Cui, his countryman,
is in second with 160.

44:52.756 --> 44:54.625
Léopold Hurbin is in third.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.394
Our American, Luke Russell,
and Grégoire Rezzonico,

44:57.461 --> 45:01.832
who makes it to Level 3 by the hair
of his chinny-chin-chin.

45:03.167 --> 45:04.334
[Luke laughs]

45:09.707 --> 45:12.342
[Tiki] Here we are at Level 3
of the Beast.

45:12.409 --> 45:15.145
This is all about
the two Chinese competitors.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.848
Bin Fang leads the way with 200 points,

45:17.915 --> 45:21.385
and Jian Cui with 160 points is in second.

45:21.452 --> 45:23.954
-The Chinese guys are impressive.
-[Luke] Absolutely.

45:24.021 --> 45:27.157
If we want to go forward,
we've got to step it up,

45:27.224 --> 45:28.859
and hope they don't do great.

45:28.926 --> 45:33.197
I think upper body is our strength,
so maybe we'll make some gains on them.

45:33.564 --> 45:34.498
-Yes.
-Good luck.

45:34.565 --> 45:38.168
[Chris] Look at this, these countries are
joining forces in an effort to break up

45:38.235 --> 45:41.338
what's been a dominant performance
so far by the Chinese.

45:41.805 --> 45:46.210
[Tiki] Bin Fang is about to take on
Level 3 of the Beast.

45:46.844 --> 45:48.479
First up, the Ejector.

45:48.912 --> 45:51.882
With two hands, he makes it.
He lands the first hand hold.

45:52.950 --> 45:54.885
[Chris] Oh, he missed a Point Thruster.

45:55.319 --> 45:58.555
-[Tiki] His arms are a little short there.
-[Chris] Could have been 40 points.

45:58.622 --> 46:00.624
[Tiki] It was like
he was reaching for the check.

46:00.691 --> 46:02.092
[Chris laughs]

46:02.159 --> 46:04.528
[Tiki] Making his way
through the Coil Crawl.

46:05.329 --> 46:09.066
[Chris] He has to get through this quick
if he wants any chance to get to Hangman.

46:10.601 --> 46:11.902
[crowd cheering]

46:13.137 --> 46:17.107
-He's really quick.
-Yes, it's easier for him to go up.

46:18.308 --> 46:20.511
[Tiki] He's racking up the points
as he goes along.

46:20.577 --> 46:24.681
Each one of these Coil Crawls -
eight-feet long - is worth five points.

46:25.716 --> 46:29.219
Can he get through fast enough
to get some more points on Hangman?

46:30.120 --> 46:32.756
Bin Fang, effectively moving through.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.795
He gets the first
of the Hangmen triangles.

46:37.861 --> 46:40.764
There are 75 points available on Hangman.

46:40.831 --> 46:45.402
[Chris] We've seen competitors look at
their palms after they've finished this,

46:45.469 --> 46:48.639
because I think
it really digs at the skin in your palms.

46:48.705 --> 46:52.876
[Tiki] What forced Bin Fang
to miss the first Point Thruster

46:52.943 --> 46:54.812
may haunt him right here.

46:54.878 --> 46:57.281
His arms are just a little bit too short.

46:58.515 --> 47:01.618
[Chris] Here's this climbing technique,
where they loop their leg.

47:01.685 --> 47:03.287
[Tiki] It's called the "Figure Four."

47:03.654 --> 47:05.789
This has exceeded our expectations.

47:06.190 --> 47:10.060
-It looks really hard. I think...
-Here he comes.

47:10.394 --> 47:12.296
[Tiki] His arms look a little bit weak.

47:12.496 --> 47:13.363
[Chris and Tiki] Oh!

47:13.430 --> 47:14.798
[Chris] He had it!

47:17.401 --> 47:21.071
Here, he's gonna get it on this one.
I can smell it, I can smell it.

47:23.006 --> 47:24.575
[commentators groan]

47:27.711 --> 47:29.880
That was great. He did great.

47:31.615 --> 47:36.220
[Tiki] And with that run,
Bin Fang accumulates 255 points,

47:36.286 --> 47:37.855
sitting pretty in first place.

47:37.921 --> 47:39.556
[Chris] Yeah, he's pretty unbeatable.

47:39.790 --> 47:41.592
[Tiki] But it's not impossible
to beat him.

47:41.658 --> 47:46.129
Our next competitors just need to be near
perfect in order to qualify for Level 4.

47:46.196 --> 47:49.132
Grégoire Rezzonico of France
gets first crack.

47:51.435 --> 47:53.537
[Chris] Come on, Grégoire! He got it.

47:53.604 --> 47:57.708
[Tiki] Grégoire, off of the Ejector,
and lands the first of the hand holds.

47:57.774 --> 47:59.409
Oh, he misses the Point Thruster!

47:59.476 --> 48:02.613
What a shame! He touched it,
but he didn't manage to push it.

48:02.679 --> 48:04.615
[Tiki] He's on to the second
of the hand holds

48:04.681 --> 48:06.650
and will make his way
into the Coil Crawl.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.785
Each one of these
is about eight-feet long -

48:08.852 --> 48:10.420
five points for each one.

48:10.487 --> 48:12.589
-Let's go! Come on, Grégoire!
-Let's go...

48:12.656 --> 48:13.490
Go!

48:13.557 --> 48:14.725
[Gilles whistles]

48:17.094 --> 48:20.030
[Tiki] You've got to get through
this Coil Crawl very effectively.

48:20.097 --> 48:24.234
Once you put your hand on it, it starts
to sink into the fuel of the Pyramid.

48:25.002 --> 48:28.338
[Chris] Now, he's on the wrong side
of that Coil Crawl. It's slowly sinking.

48:28.405 --> 48:29.573
[Tiki] Remember the rule -

48:29.640 --> 48:33.677
as long as he doesn't get all four limbs
into the fuel of the Pyramid,

48:33.744 --> 48:34.678
he'll be OK.

48:35.412 --> 48:36.680
[cheering]

48:37.814 --> 48:41.251
[Tiki] He's a little bit low. He's got
to take an epic jump, an epic leap.

48:41.318 --> 48:44.621
He's got a long reach.
Is he going to be able to recover?

48:44.688 --> 48:47.457
-[Chris] He's got to work here.
-[Tiki] Reach that last Coil Crawl.

48:47.524 --> 48:49.693
[Chris] He's got to work.
He's really got to work.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.895
[Tiki] Oh, I think he's conceded.

48:52.729 --> 48:57.100
Oh no, Grégoire... He was one of
our highest hopes for the French team.

48:57.167 --> 48:58.602
He wasn't quick enough.

49:00.504 --> 49:02.940
[Grégoire] I fell and hit the hoop
on the way down.

49:03.006 --> 49:05.542
I need to train a bit more
on those kinds of obstacles.

49:05.609 --> 49:10.347
Grégoire finishes with 100 points -
only 15 points on Level 3.

49:10.414 --> 49:13.617
But because of the competitors
already above him,

49:13.684 --> 49:15.752
he will not make it to Level 4.

49:15.819 --> 49:18.055
He is knocked out of this competition.

49:18.121 --> 49:22.025
Up next in Level 3, Jian Cui,

49:22.092 --> 49:25.529
who comes in in second place,
with 160 points.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.332
Jian Cui! Jian Cui!

49:29.099 --> 49:30.901
[Tiki] Here he goes, down the Ejector.

49:30.968 --> 49:35.105
[Chris] Jian Cui, looking to leap,
and he makes it on to Prism Strike.

49:35.172 --> 49:36.940
Will he get the Point Thruster?

49:37.007 --> 49:40.377
Oh! He waited a little too long.
He missed it with his foot.

49:40.911 --> 49:45.582
Easily makes the transition to the second
hand hold and on to the Coil Crawl.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.017
[crowd applauding]

49:47.084 --> 49:50.954
[Tiki] This Coil Crawl starts to sink
as soon as the competitors touch it.

49:51.755 --> 49:55.158
The hardest part about Level 3

49:55.692 --> 49:59.963
is you need to rely on your arm strength,
and there's no place to rest.

50:00.998 --> 50:03.900
[Chris] I think the best way is to wrap
yourself around the pole,

50:03.967 --> 50:05.402
like a fast-moving sloth,

50:05.469 --> 50:07.337
and get through before it hits the oil.

50:07.404 --> 50:10.240
[Tiki] I think only the climbers
are really adept at doing that.

50:10.307 --> 50:12.442
[Chris] Yeah. Oh, wow! Look at him.

50:12.509 --> 50:16.446
He's doing something...
He's exerting a lot of energy, though.

50:17.981 --> 50:21.585
-He's using another method...
-What's he doing?

50:21.818 --> 50:24.021
...on the Coil Crawl.

50:24.087 --> 50:25.389
He's moving quickly.

50:25.956 --> 50:28.458
[Tiki] Jian Cui
is gonna find the same problem

50:28.525 --> 50:30.727
that a lot of our competitors encounter -

50:30.794 --> 50:34.431
they can't get through
the Coil Crawl fast enough,

50:34.498 --> 50:36.867
as it sinks into the fuel of the Pyramid.

50:37.367 --> 50:38.602
[Chris] He's got wet feet now.

50:38.668 --> 50:40.737
[Tiki] If he gets to the Hangman,
it won't matter.

50:41.638 --> 50:43.407
Oh, he just can't make it!

50:43.473 --> 50:44.775
[commentators groan]

50:45.642 --> 50:48.211
Jian Cui jumped with all his might,
but what a pity...

50:49.079 --> 50:50.680
[Jian] It's still...

50:50.747 --> 50:52.315
I tried my best.

50:52.382 --> 50:53.316
I think I did well.

50:54.017 --> 50:55.819
I missed the first Point Thruster.

50:56.420 --> 50:59.056
I wasted too much energy here.

50:59.122 --> 51:02.793
My arms were tired and
it's too slippery because of the water.

51:03.360 --> 51:09.666
[Tiki] 25 points for Jian Cui in Level 3,
leaving him with 185 points.

51:09.733 --> 51:13.437
The only thing he can do
is hope to hold on to second place.

51:13.503 --> 51:15.338
[Chris] Two competitors left.

51:15.405 --> 51:16.406
USA!

51:16.473 --> 51:17.874
-[man] Who are we?
-USA!

51:18.442 --> 51:23.914
[Tiki] Can Luke Russell, from the United
States, disrupt the Chinese domination?

51:23.980 --> 51:26.516
He starts with 130 points.

51:26.583 --> 51:29.920
He's got to get at least 55
to give himself a chance

51:29.986 --> 51:31.955
to get into Level 4.

51:32.456 --> 51:34.758
[Chris] I'm a gambling man.
So is he - he's from Las Vegas.

51:34.825 --> 51:39.262
-So, I think he can do it.
-[Tiki] Controlled jump off the Ejector.

51:39.329 --> 51:42.099
And he nails the Point Thruster
on Prism Strike.

51:42.165 --> 51:47.471
[Chris] Luke, at one time in his life,
completed a 36-hour, Navy SEAL challenge,

51:47.537 --> 51:48.872
and he won the final award.

51:48.939 --> 51:51.608
So, do you think this is harder
than what Navy SEALs do?

51:51.675 --> 51:52.709
[Tiki] I would think not.

51:53.743 --> 51:54.845
[Chris] Luke is a climber,

51:54.911 --> 51:58.381
so whatever technique he's doing,
I'm sure it's the right one.

51:59.850 --> 52:03.320
[Tiki] He had a little bit of trouble
getting off that first Coil Crawl.

52:03.653 --> 52:07.591
This is all about speed. He's got
to crawl like his life depends on it.

52:07.657 --> 52:10.060
Let's hope he can move
through this very quickly,

52:10.127 --> 52:14.464
because we all know the Coil Crawl
sinks into the fuel of the Pyramid.

52:14.531 --> 52:18.401
And if you don't get through fast enough,
you don't have a chance for Hangman.

52:18.468 --> 52:20.637
[Chris] Luke, if you can hear me,
which you can't,

52:20.704 --> 52:23.273
you have to make it
through the first five handles,

52:23.340 --> 52:25.542
if you want to beat Jian Cui.

52:25.609 --> 52:26.910
Also, I am your father.

52:26.977 --> 52:30.413
[Tiki] It's not looking good
for Luke Russell right now.

52:30.480 --> 52:33.150
-[Chris] This is not gonna work.
-[Tiki] He's deep into the fuel.

52:33.216 --> 52:36.286
[Chris] He's got to climb up,
he's got to get to the top of that ring...

52:37.454 --> 52:41.057
[Tiki] And his chances are sinking.

52:42.325 --> 52:43.326
[Chris] Oh, Luke!

52:43.393 --> 52:45.829
[Tiki] And he knows he can't make it.

52:45.896 --> 52:48.899
35 points for Luke Russell,

52:48.965 --> 52:54.304
which puts him at 165 points,
which is not enough.

52:54.371 --> 52:57.974
He is mathematically eliminated
from the competition.

52:58.041 --> 53:02.012
[Luke] Coil Crawl is just so many moving
parts, it's hard to get into a rhythm.

53:02.078 --> 53:03.547
It just keeps shifting on you.

53:03.613 --> 53:06.216
You have to regain that momentum again,
slipping...

53:06.283 --> 53:09.819
Definitely more taxing on the upper body
than I was thinking it would be.

53:09.886 --> 53:11.888
Being eliminated is a let-down,

53:12.222 --> 53:14.191
but the level of competition is awesome.

53:14.257 --> 53:15.258
I'm happy to be here.

53:15.992 --> 53:17.794
I'm happy to compete with these guys.

53:17.861 --> 53:20.730
Luke, a proud nation salutes you, buddy.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.136
[Chris] Next up, from France,
we have Léopold Hurbin.

53:26.203 --> 53:29.573
And if he doesn't do well here,
it's gonna be an all-Chinese final.

53:29.639 --> 53:30.473
[Tiki] Absolutely.

53:30.540 --> 53:34.778
If he wants to get to Level 4,
he's got to earn 60 points at least.

53:34.844 --> 53:36.713
And that's deep into Hangman.

53:37.247 --> 53:40.483
Very well executed... Is he going to go
for the ten extra points?

53:40.550 --> 53:41.384
Yes!

53:41.451 --> 53:44.754
-[Chris] Got the Point Thruster. See that?
-[Tiki] He did. Strong upper body.

53:44.821 --> 53:46.656
Let's hope that strong upper body

53:46.723 --> 53:50.393
translates into
climbing through this Coil Crawl

53:50.460 --> 53:51.661
with some quickness.

53:51.728 --> 53:53.863
He's having some trouble getting into it.

53:53.930 --> 53:56.566
We don't usually see
our competitors struggle there.

53:56.933 --> 53:58.501
[Chris] He only needs 30 more points

53:58.568 --> 54:00.971
to knock out Jian Cui
and earn a spot in the final.

54:01.037 --> 54:04.774
[Tiki] Chris, this one's going
to come down to the wire, I can feel it.

54:05.742 --> 54:09.512
It's important to get through quick to get
to the next one with some altitude,

54:09.579 --> 54:11.548
as opposed to going across the bottom.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.784
He's struggling on the second Coil Crawl.

54:14.851 --> 54:17.520
-Didn't employ the same technique.
-[Chris] No.

54:17.587 --> 54:19.122
It's getting wonky.

54:21.024 --> 54:24.094
He's using the same technique
as Grégoire here,

54:24.160 --> 54:25.795
but he needs to get up high again.

54:27.163 --> 54:29.733
[Tiki] Eight feet of Coil Crawl.

54:29.799 --> 54:31.968
Five points for each one.

54:36.573 --> 54:38.341
He's made his way on to Hangman.

54:38.408 --> 54:41.211
Each one of these handles
is worth five points.

54:41.278 --> 54:42.679
He only needs four more

54:42.746 --> 54:45.548
to make it to Level 4
and knock out Jian Cui.

54:46.816 --> 54:50.353
He's getting there,
but he's paused just a little bit.

54:50.420 --> 54:53.123
[Chris] Two more now, I think.
He's close. He's got two more.

54:53.189 --> 54:56.693
-He's equal with Jian Cui right now!
-One more, Léo!

54:56.760 --> 55:00.997
[Tiki] Just one more handle
and Léopold will make it to Level 4.

55:01.064 --> 55:05.068
[Chris] Let's see, Léopold. Come on!
You're hanging! Hold on!

55:05.135 --> 55:07.337
-One more!
-Come on!

55:07.804 --> 55:09.272
[Tiki] He is really fighting.

55:09.339 --> 55:10.340
[commentators groan]

55:10.407 --> 55:11.675
[Sandy] No, no, no!

55:11.741 --> 55:13.109
[Tiki] Oh, my goodness!

55:13.176 --> 55:14.844
[Chris] And he could not make it.

55:14.911 --> 55:18.048
[Tiki] All he needed to do
was grab one more.

55:18.481 --> 55:20.483
[Léopold] My arms totally seized up.

55:20.550 --> 55:25.021
I could stay hanging, but I didn't have
enough strength left to swing forwards.

55:25.088 --> 55:27.257
I tried one last time, but it didn't work.

55:27.691 --> 55:32.896
[Tiki] Léopold Hurbin
is in a mathematical tie with Jian Cui,

55:32.962 --> 55:38.201
but as you look at the clock,
he will be knocked out.

55:38.268 --> 55:40.503
Jian Cui has a faster time.

55:42.072 --> 55:45.275
It is an all-Chinese final.

55:45.342 --> 55:47.844
Yes!

55:47.911 --> 55:49.045
Woo!

55:49.612 --> 55:51.414
It's an unprecedented moment.

55:51.648 --> 55:53.316
To be number one!

55:57.520 --> 56:01.524
[Chris] Alright, get ready.
This is the great brawl of China.

56:01.758 --> 56:04.361
-[Tiki] I see what you did there.
-[Chris] Thank you.

56:05.195 --> 56:10.233
We have Bin Fang of China versus Jian Cui
of even more China,

56:10.300 --> 56:12.235
going up in Level 4.

56:12.302 --> 56:16.673
[Tiki] Battle of the Far East.
Bin Fang comes in with 255 points.

56:16.740 --> 56:20.377
Jian Cui comes in with 185 points.

56:20.443 --> 56:22.412
70 points makes the difference.

56:23.246 --> 56:25.882
That doesn't mean that Jian Cui
is out of this race,

56:25.949 --> 56:30.620
but he needs to get out ahead of Bin Fang
and get to those Point Thrusters first.

56:30.687 --> 56:33.223
[Chris] Yeah, and if Jian Cui
manages to keep the race tight,

56:33.289 --> 56:36.459
it will come down to that Point Thruster
on top of the Ventilator,

56:36.526 --> 56:39.362
which is worth 200 points.

56:39.429 --> 56:42.098
And the winner gets a baby panda.

56:42.465 --> 56:46.169
[Tiki] Not to mention,
the title of Beastmaster.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.004
Beastmaster!

56:48.471 --> 56:52.075
Bianca, this is a great moment for China!

56:52.142 --> 56:56.079
They have two athletes in the fourth
level, competing for the final victory.

56:56.146 --> 57:01.284
At this point, they aren't fighting
for themselves but for their country.

57:01.351 --> 57:02.485
So good luck!

57:03.153 --> 57:07.524
[Chris] Bin Fang, "The Hunting Knight,"
versus Jian Cui,

57:07.590 --> 57:09.726
the guy who wants to be a stunt actor.

57:09.793 --> 57:13.963
[Tiki] And here they go,
up the great wall of the Beast.

57:14.397 --> 57:15.665
[crowd applauding]

57:16.833 --> 57:21.571
So who can perform better in this round?

57:22.405 --> 57:24.574
[Tiki] Here they go across Full Tilt.

57:24.641 --> 57:30.747
Those blocks tilt 12 inches
every time they put some weight on it.

57:31.114 --> 57:36.619
Bin Fang is charging back,
and Jian Cui looks to be stuck.

57:37.253 --> 57:39.556
[Chris] Oh, wow.
Bin Fang is really turning up the heat.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.925
[cheering]

57:42.625 --> 57:43.860
[Chris] The Fangz.

57:43.927 --> 57:47.497
[Tiki] Bin Fang grabs his pegs
on the Motherboard,

57:47.564 --> 57:51.034
goes for the Point Thruster and nails it,

57:51.100 --> 57:52.469
adding to his lead.

57:53.236 --> 57:56.773
He now has an 80-point lead over Jian Cui.

57:57.307 --> 58:00.076
-Nice. Jian Cui's doing great.
-He's doing good.

58:00.143 --> 58:03.213
Could he be the dark horse?

58:04.547 --> 58:05.849
[Chris] Fang, taking his time.

58:05.915 --> 58:09.686
We've seen other competitors take a rest,
and you say, "What are you doing?"

58:09.752 --> 58:12.956
But this is so difficult -
climbing up the Motherboard -

58:13.022 --> 58:16.860
that Bin Fang has an idea
that Jian Cui may slip,

58:16.926 --> 58:18.795
and then Bin Fang will regain the lead.

58:18.862 --> 58:20.797
That's what I think he's thinking.

58:20.864 --> 58:23.666
Even if I did know what he's thinking,
it's all in Chinese.

58:23.733 --> 58:26.769
[Tiki] This takes so much
upper body strength, Chris,

58:26.836 --> 58:30.106
and if you falter just a little bit,
you fall down.

58:30.173 --> 58:33.743
I think the philosophy that Bin Fang
tried to employ could be working out,

58:33.810 --> 58:36.412
as he's storming now, up the Motherboard.

58:44.888 --> 58:45.822
[Tiki] No hesitation.

58:46.589 --> 58:51.394
As we see on the other side,
Jian Cui has kind of gotten stuck.

58:51.461 --> 58:52.362
[Chris] Yeah.

58:54.664 --> 58:58.601
-Bin Fang reached the top.
-Jian Cui is tired.

58:59.502 --> 59:01.104
[cheering]

59:03.973 --> 59:05.808
[Tiki] Bin Fang, making a go at Sky Hook.

59:05.875 --> 59:07.377
-[Chris] Let's see if he can do it.

59:07.443 --> 59:09.913
[Tiki] Each of those hooks
is five more points.

59:09.979 --> 59:13.249
Right now, Jian Cui is in trouble.

59:13.316 --> 59:16.953
He's trying to stick his feet
into the little peg holes.

59:17.020 --> 59:20.924
There is no foothold,
so this is all upper body.

59:21.624 --> 59:24.727
[Chris] But things are starting to go
wrong right now for Bin Fang.

59:24.794 --> 59:28.197
One slip and Jian Cui may have a chance.

59:28.531 --> 59:30.266
[crowd groan]

59:32.435 --> 59:35.471
[Tiki] Jian Cui
has got to make his move now.

59:35.538 --> 59:36.673
[commentators groan]

59:36.739 --> 59:37.574
[Tiki] And he falls!

59:38.274 --> 59:40.677
Jian Cui has fallen,

59:40.743 --> 59:43.279
and he must go all the way down
to the bottom.

59:44.614 --> 59:46.849
With less than 20 seconds left,

59:46.916 --> 59:50.620
it is not looking good for Jian Cui.

59:51.321 --> 59:52.889
Ten seconds. Ten...

59:53.423 --> 59:56.826
[Tiki and Chris] Nine, eight, seven, six,

59:56.893 --> 01:00:01.431
five, four, three, two, one.

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.833
[Tiki] Bin Fang!

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:07.503
Bin Fang gets to the end of Sky Hook

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:10.673
and wins the title of Beastmaster.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.141
[Chris] Congratulations, Bin!

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:16.446
Bin Fang will represent this group
in the grand finale

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:21.884
and compete with the other contestants
for the title of Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:25.355
Congratulations to Bin Fang from Zhejiang.

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:31.361
[Tiki] Bin Fang,
representing the C-H-I-N-A.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:34.530
He is the C-H-I-N-A in charge.

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:36.933
He will go on to face the other winners

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.371
for a chance to be crowned
the Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:45.475
-This is our Bin Fang!
-We have two winners.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:50.813
[Bin] I'm honored to have competed with
the top contestants from six countries.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:56.419
They were really good, so I feel like
I need to work harder for the finale.

01:00:56.919 --> 01:01:00.423
I haven't reached my goal yet.
I have to put in continuous effort.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:04.627
I hope I'll perform better
during the grand finale.

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.167
[rapturous cheering]

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:20.543
[Tiki] Are you hungry
for some more Beastmaster?

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:21.778
Well, stay right there.

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:25.381
Twelve new competitors
take on the Beast, next.

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:27.884
[theme music playing]
