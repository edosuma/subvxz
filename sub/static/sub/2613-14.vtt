00:30.030 --> 00:31.691
Good afternoon.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.026
I need to, uh...
make a withdrawal.

00:38.371 --> 00:42.000
I'll need to see
some identification.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.013
There's sufficient funds
in the account.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.353
Just have to clear it with my manager.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.722
Is that going to take long?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.257
I'll be right back.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.378
Is there a problem here?!

01:22.415 --> 01:23.917
It's a lot of money,
Mr. Logan.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.010
It's going to
take some time.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.808
Mr. Logan, would you like an escort
to your car?

02:21.574 --> 02:24.407
Reckless driver. In pursuit.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.812
Damn!

02:46.166 --> 02:48.794
Everything all right, sir?

02:54.107 --> 02:55.836
Do you want to get that?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.151
I think you should step
out of the car,

03:05.185 --> 03:06.920
and keep your hands
where I can see them.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.444
Let's go.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.865
So how rich
is this guy?

03:18.865 --> 03:20.767
Well, he had a million dollars in his

03:20.767 --> 03:21.801
Who doesn't?

03:21.801 --> 03:23.870
He's a real estate
developer.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.873
On the mayor's committee
to revitalize downtown.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.465
And he hasn't said
a word to anyone?

03:28.541 --> 03:30.168
Nope.
That's why we're here.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.174
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.211
You don't have
to say anything.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.961
Mr. Logan...

03:47.961 --> 03:50.196
would you please
put your hands out?

03:50.196 --> 03:51.891
Palms up.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.205
I'm also going to need you
to strip.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.908
What?

04:09.849 --> 04:12.249
Vegas.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.354
Thank you, Mr. Logan.

04:48.354 --> 04:51.090
You can put
your shirt down.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.149
Left arm out, please.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.990
Right arm.

05:02.068 --> 05:04.263
No visible injuries.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.039
No blood on his clothes.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.307
How long is this
going to take?

05:07.307 --> 05:10.299
Sorry for the inconvenience.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.280
What the hell
is going on here?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.648
Paul, get me out of here now.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.849
Roy, put your
clothes back on.

05:16.849 --> 05:18.217
Don't say another word
to these people.

05:18.217 --> 05:21.020
I'm taking my complaint directly
to the district attorney.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.080
You had no grounds to detain Mr. Logan, let

05:24.324 --> 05:25.985
Well, his hands
were covered in blood,

05:26.025 --> 05:28.027
and he had a million dollars in his

05:28.027 --> 05:29.228
It's not a crime
to be rich.

05:29.228 --> 05:29.829
Where's my car?

05:29.829 --> 05:33.265
It's right up front. My secretary
drove it here.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.666
You're going to be hearing
from us.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.670
Didn't Shakespeare say,

05:40.707 --> 05:42.342
"Let's kill all the lawyers"?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.310
Yeah.
Henry VI.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.346
Where is he when we need him?

05:46.346 --> 05:49.015
Yeah. Hey, can you do me a favor, and drop

05:49.015 --> 05:50.917
I'm due at
a nursery rhyme recital.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.685
Lindsey's going to play
the girl in the moon.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.354
What happened
to the man in the moon?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.379
He got the mumps.

06:02.628 --> 06:05.426
Mr. Logan!

06:06.165 --> 06:09.032
You forgot
your sunglasses.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.541
Service-oriented
policing.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.338
You don't understand.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.345
Get away from me.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.285
Hello.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.363
It's for you.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.366
What?

06:43.536 --> 06:44.434
Hello?

06:46.439 --> 06:48.941
(high-pitched, altered voice):
Who are you?

06:48.941 --> 06:50.309
CSl-3 Willows.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.368
Who are you?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.380
Are you a cop?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.382
Criminalist.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.385
Good. Because,
if you had been a cop,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.387
she'd already be dead.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.089
Who would be dead?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.386
Do you have a weapon?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.392
Yes.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.089
Then put it on the ground,
along with your pager,

07:10.129 --> 07:13.099
cell phone and that case
you're holding.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.967
Do it!
Who is this?

07:14.967 --> 07:17.401
We're watching you,
CSl-3 Willows.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.507
Attempt to go back into the police

07:21.507 --> 07:25.178
Attempt to contact any coworkers, and we'll

07:25.178 --> 07:29.115
Any false moves at all,
and Amanda is dead.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.413
Now get back in the car.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.454
You drive, anywhere but here,

07:34.454 --> 07:37.651
and await my next call.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.425
What did he say?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.763
Is Amanda all right?

07:43.763 --> 07:46.857
Let's talk in the car.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.221
What did you find?

08:42.221 --> 08:43.482
The blood's female.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.191
Definitely not Logan's.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.392
I ran Roy Logan.

08:46.392 --> 08:49.729
No criminal record,
no wants, no warrants.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.197
The blood on his hand
was female.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.432
The guy's married.
He lives in Summerlin.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.067
Bucks up. Got a
seven-year-old son.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.235
But I'll check him out.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.737
What about the car?

08:57.737 --> 08:58.337
Code Five:

08:58.337 --> 09:00.206
Keep vehicle under surveillance;

09:00.206 --> 09:02.504
do not make contact
with occupants.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.544
You know, Catherine
had a gun.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.307
She could've used it.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.821
You never answered my question. Who's

09:15.821 --> 09:18.119
Amanda's my girlfriend.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.186
Yeah, I know, I know.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.462
My, uh... my wife doesn't know.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.521
Somebody does.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.228
How did they make contact?

09:31.003 --> 09:34.530
I, uh... I probably left
a dozen messages for her

09:34.574 --> 09:38.177
and, um... she, uh...
never called me back,

09:38.177 --> 09:41.080
so I went over to the condo...
to the condo

09:41.080 --> 09:42.448
and, uh...

09:42.448 --> 09:44.575
this was waiting for me
on the bed.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.593
Got your attention.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.561
My cell phone rang;
it was the kidnapper.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.331
He said, uh... he wanted
a million dollars in cash

09:58.331 --> 10:00.561
by the end of the day
or he would...

10:00.600 --> 10:03.228
he would send me
the rest of her.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.605
He said if I...
talked to the cops...

10:05.605 --> 10:08.233
Yeah, I heard that part.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.510
I need a drink.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.045
I can't believe you called.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.548
I actually got you
outside of work.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.716
This is nice.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.318
I don't normally date
women from work,

10:19.318 --> 10:22.521
but there was...
something about you.

10:22.521 --> 10:25.285
And it definitely
wasn't your perfume.

10:25.658 --> 10:28.286
I cannot believe
you brought that up.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.562
Yeah, that-that-that...
uh... day we met...

10:32.632 --> 10:34.600
that... that was...
that was very gross.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.301
Um...

10:35.301 --> 10:36.598
I mean, not for me,

10:36.636 --> 10:39.036
but for everyone else... for you.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.913
Isn't that one
of your coworkers?

10:47.913 --> 10:49.642
Yeah.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.620
We don't
know how long it's going to be
before he calls.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.622
Why don't you
order something?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.591
You expect me to
eat?

10:58.591 --> 11:00.726
We should be in the car,
waiting by the phone.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.626
I have the phone.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.399
Do us both a favor: Relax.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.627
What can I get you?

11:08.100 --> 11:11.303
Um, two glasses:
One with ice;
one without.

11:11.303 --> 11:11.937
Roy?

11:11.937 --> 11:14.428
Uh... coffee. Black.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.835
So, let's get
to know each other. You first.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.084
You were born; you came home
from the hospital.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.711
Then what?

11:27.319 --> 11:29.588
Maybe he wanted to confess.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.524
Take her to the body.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.425
Catherine wouldn't have
left her stuff behind.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.662
Hey. I sent a patrolman
to Logan's house.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.830
Talked to Mrs. Logan.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.465
She's in perfect health.

11:39.465 --> 11:40.900
She's not our vic.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.201
So what do we do now?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.236
We wait. Right?

11:44.236 --> 11:47.831
Yeah. We don't have a crime yet.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.806
Give me the finger.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.822
What if somebody sees you?

12:02.822 --> 12:05.552
I got to preserve this evidence.

12:16.836 --> 12:17.536
Hello.

12:17.536 --> 12:23.008
(high-pitched altered voice): Take Boulder

12:23.008 --> 12:24.844
Take the Yucca exit east,
one mile.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.747
You'll see a sign:
Horseshoe Tavern.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.908
You have one hour.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.413
What'd he say?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.519
Let's go.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.433
Is that a finger?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.362
Open the briefcase.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.853
I've got an idea.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.501
I use this to paint my daughter's face

13:22.501 --> 13:25.805
She was playing the moon
tonight in the school play.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.973
I missed it.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.567
Mark the edges of the money.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.484
So, you got any kids?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.352
Yeah, I got a son.

13:40.352 --> 13:41.754
He's a soccer freak.

13:41.754 --> 13:46.316
His life's ambition
is to be Roberto Baggio.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.494
Hey, there's a cop.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.929
There's a cop.
Slow down. Come on.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.530
We don't want
to be pulled over.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.192
If we're seen with a cop, Amanda's dead

14:01.140 --> 14:03.409
Catherine didn't say anything?

14:03.409 --> 14:04.410
She barely made eye contact.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.213
She just dropped the finger on
the table, and she walked out.

14:07.213 --> 14:07.847
Where is it?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.849
Locked up at the Coroner's Lab,
waiting for Dr. Robbins.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.851
Unless you want to wake
him up in Kansas City.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.352
Brother's wedding,
back tomorrow...

14:13.352 --> 14:14.854
It was the right
index finger?

14:14.854 --> 14:18.357
Top half sever e d
just below the right
intercostal joint.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.291
Any hemorrhagic tissue?

14:19.291 --> 14:21.627
Yeah, I couldn't tell.
There was blood, though.

14:21.627 --> 14:22.561
How did
Catherine seem?

14:22.561 --> 14:24.864
Like I told Nick,
she completely
ignored me.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.899
And her behavior
toward Logan?

14:26.899 --> 14:28.734
Was she under duress?
Agitated?

14:28.734 --> 14:31.871
No. No. Looked to me like Catherine was

14:31.871 --> 14:34.840
A severed finger,
a million bucks.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.877
And Catherine's not allowed
to talk to anyone.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.211
Kidnapping?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.980
So, who's
worth one mil?

14:40.980 --> 14:43.916
It's time to speak
to his wife.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.117
I'll call Brass.

14:45.117 --> 14:46.846
It's a bit of a coincidence, thought, don't you

14:46.886 --> 14:48.520
Catherine just
showing up
at the diner.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.024
I mean, it's not
like she knew I was
going to be there.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.925
I knew.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.436
All right,
that's it... Yucca.

15:04.436 --> 15:08.270
One more mile.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.429
Are you crazy?

15:30.429 --> 15:33.933
Sorry. It's been awhile since I've driven
a sports car.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.094
Thanks.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.950
00:16:01:0700:16:04:03 (gate creaking)

16:29.288 --> 16:31.483
(high-pitched, altered voice):
The briefcase.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.328
First we need
to see Amanda.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.863
Hand over the money

16:37.863 --> 16:43.002
get back in the car,
and drive to a pay phone.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.970
The Gas-and-Go station,

16:45.004 --> 16:49.308
Highway 582,
south of Henderson.

16:49.308 --> 16:52.800
I will call you.
I will tell you where she is.

16:53.012 --> 16:57.016
No. We need something more
than just your word.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.017
Then she's dead.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.814
No, wait!

17:01.420 --> 17:03.854
Easy.

17:09.328 --> 17:14.321
The Gas-and-Go station,
Highway 582, south of Henderson.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.914
Mrs. Logan?

17:28.914 --> 17:31.007
Yes? Uh... One
minute, please.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.017
Oh, come on, honey.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.053
Last time you got food
all over the place,

17:34.053 --> 17:37.352
your father spent a fortune detailing the car.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.685
Mrs. Logan, I'm Jim Brass,
Las Vegas PD.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.561
This is Nick Stokes, Crime Lab.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.429
Hi.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.064
Have you heard
from your husband?

17:45.064 --> 17:45.731
(clears throat):
No.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.066
When he didn't come
home last night,

17:47.066 --> 17:51.070
did you find that unusual?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.731
Or maybe you're used to it.

17:52.771 --> 17:57.076
Look, our lawyer has advised me
not to speak to the police.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.069
And, until I hear from Roy, that's exactly what

18:01.113 --> 18:03.749
How about if we just
have a look around?

18:03.749 --> 18:06.081
I don't think so.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.440
I don't see a phone.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.635
Where's
the phone?

18:44.456 --> 18:46.058
Damn it!

18:46.058 --> 18:49.128
They set us up. She's dead.
I
knew
it!

18:49.128 --> 18:51.029
He had a shotgun.

18:51.029 --> 18:54.692
If all he wanted was the money,
we'd both be dead.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.815
Give me the phone.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.113
No, no, no... no, no! He said no phone calls.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.119
- They may be watch... - We're past that.
Give me the phone!

19:14.153 --> 19:17.923
Listen, please. What if it was
someone
you
loved?

19:17.923 --> 19:20.153
What if it was your daughter?!

19:21.927 --> 19:25.164
The blood from the finger
was diluted due to the ice.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.167
- But I made a positive match -To the blood
on Logan's hands.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.835
So it was kind of
like Getty's ear?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.170
They cut it off,
sent it to the house?

19:31.170 --> 19:34.506
Wife was way too cool to have seen a

19:34.506 --> 19:36.508
He sent it somewhere. He's a real estate
developer.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.497
Does he own any other properties?

19:37.543 --> 19:39.178
Townhouse off Flamingo.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.180
Under the company name,
not rented.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.848
But occupied?

19:42.848 --> 19:43.749
I'll get a warrant.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.185
See if anybody's missing
a finger over there.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.186
Hey.
Hey. Gris,

19:47.186 --> 19:50.155
State Troopers just spotted
Logan's car on the 582.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.857
Drove past him
earlier this morning.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.159
Five minutes later,
drove past him again
going the other way.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.320
Grab Sara. We're gone.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.213
Thank you, Catherine.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.516
She was burning some serious rubber.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.489
Definitely
high-end tires.

20:57.489 --> 21:00.259
There's colored flecks
on the treads, and they're fresh.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.262
It's gotta
be the Lexus.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.253
Does this mean
anything to you?

21:06.265 --> 21:09.234
Looks like some kind
of glow paint stick.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.270
I think Catherine

21:11.270 --> 21:14.206
dragged her heels
a little bit here.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.367
Yeah.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.778
Helium canister.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.180
You mean like helium
for balloons?

21:22.180 --> 21:24.950
You can use it to change
the pitch in your voice.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.286
The Lexus stopped there.

21:27.286 --> 21:31.313
Catherine walked up to here.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.294
Could be
the kidnapper's.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.297
Looks like the drop-off
went down.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.028
Then why hasn't Catherine
contacted us yet?

21:50.976 --> 21:53.308
Criminalistics. Anybody home?

22:12.331 --> 22:15.994
Okay... talk to me.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.321
Hey, Amanda, it's Roy.

22:36.355 --> 22:40.883
Where are you?
Call me on my cell, okay?

22:46.698 --> 22:49.368
Hey, Amanda, I thought
you'd be home all day.

22:49.368 --> 22:53.896
So... I wanted to swing by.
Uh... call me.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.044
Amanda, it's Mark.
I'm at the gym.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.379
Listen, you missed your session.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.871
Call to reschedule.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.992
Too bad you can't talk.

23:13.992 --> 23:17.018
Maybe you could tell me
where she is.

23:54.766 --> 23:59.438
Well... according
to the map, she should be somewhere
around here.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.805
Amanda!

24:04.009 --> 24:06.534
Amanda!

24:07.779 --> 24:10.976
Why don't you give me a hand
with this?

24:24.529 --> 24:26.463
Oh, God...

24:32.471 --> 24:34.462
Oh, God...

24:53.892 --> 24:56.695
The finger was severed
postmortem.

24:56.695 --> 25:00.232
No hemorrhagic tissue
at the point of injury.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.167
And they used
a serrated blade.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.465
Jagged teeth patterns
on the bone.

25:04.503 --> 25:08.269
Not much else I can tell you. It's just a finger.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.171
Grissom.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.139
Thank God.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.477
There was a kidnapping.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.584
I know. Amanda Freeman.

25:19.584 --> 25:21.720
She's dead... and whoever
touched the money

25:21.720 --> 25:24.523
probably has glow-in-the-dark
paint on their hands.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.057
You got my clues?

25:26.057 --> 25:27.526
Yeah. Nicely done.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.729
I know just about everything
except...

25:30.729 --> 25:33.562
Where are you?

25:34.799 --> 25:37.168
She ate, but she didn't
fall asleep until way late.

25:37.168 --> 25:39.538
We had her helping
Greggo out in the lab.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.530
I bet she loved that.
Yeah.

25:47.078 --> 25:48.545
I owe you. Thank you.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.540
So, you couldn't see
what he looked like?

26:15.540 --> 26:17.776
You're assuming
it was a "he."

26:17.776 --> 26:19.277
Rabbit mask.

26:19.277 --> 26:20.539
Full-beam headlights.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.247
Truman Capote voice.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.215
Who can tell gender?

26:24.249 --> 26:25.546
Amanda Freeman.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.554
My guess is, she's been

26:29.588 --> 26:32.557
in the water about 24 hours.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.288
Washerwoman effect, but no saponification.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.570
Blowfly eggs?

26:45.604 --> 26:47.606
Unhatched ova.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.807
They're waterlogged.

26:48.807 --> 26:51.343
I found some in her nose
and trachea, too.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.573
The decomposing body
would need time

26:53.612 --> 26:55.614
to attract the bug s
before submersion.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.582
She's been dead 48 hours...

26:57.616 --> 27:00.285
24 hours above water,
24 hours under.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.617
Bloody nose, ecchymosis.

27:02.754 --> 27:04.585
She took a beating.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.057
Cause of death?

27:06.057 --> 27:07.581
Blunt-force trauma.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.615
Back of the head.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.497
Look at this.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.595
What is it?

27:18.637 --> 27:20.705
You'll have to get it
under the microscope.

27:20.705 --> 27:22.774
My guess is
some form of stone.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.605
Granite maybe.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.409
I'm going to head over
to the townhouse, check out those blood
spots

27:33.818 --> 27:35.615
Mr. Logan?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.389
I need to see her.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.617
Please.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.292
I wouldn't advise that.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.294
Look, she...

27:43.294 --> 27:45.524
was my life.

27:46.531 --> 27:47.657
I loved her.

27:49.034 --> 27:50.729
Please?

27:59.711 --> 28:02.179
It's my fault.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.383
If I'd only...

28:05.383 --> 28:06.551
gotten to her sooner.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.353
If I'd only paid them sooner...

28:08.353 --> 28:10.651
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.824
She was killed long before
you could have helped her.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.492
When?

28:14.492 --> 28:16.261
Where?

28:16.261 --> 28:17.162
You got
to give us time.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.892
Why don't you go home,
get some sleep?

28:23.168 --> 28:26.365
I-I don't think I can face
my wife right now.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.673
This town is
full of hotels.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.041
All right.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.703
You can find me
at the Tangiers.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.695
Marble.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.697
Good to see you again.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.564
Yeah, somebody
hit the table.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.169
There's obvious signs
of a struggle.

28:58.169 --> 29:00.137
Kidnapper probably broke in.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.274
She made a run for it.

29:03.274 --> 29:05.276
Got hit in the face.

29:05.276 --> 29:06.504
Went down.

29:08.813 --> 29:11.216
Blood pool here.

29:11.216 --> 29:13.885
Spatter all the way
to the bird.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.287
Birds have blood feathers
and flight feathers.

29:16.287 --> 29:17.756
Flight feathers
don't bleed.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.748
No capillaries,
just cartilage.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.720
And you
know this from...?

29:23.762 --> 29:25.753
Discovery Channel.

29:28.166 --> 29:31.658
So, how did the killer get
the body out of the house?

29:32.937 --> 29:35.406
There's no blood
trail from here

29:35.406 --> 29:37.408
to the door,
so my guess is

29:37.408 --> 29:39.244
he wrapped her
in something.

29:39.244 --> 29:40.411
Bedsheets?
Checked.

29:40.411 --> 29:43.448
Bed's still made. Linen closet's full.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.517
Not to mention,
a wet sheet leaks.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.553
Plastic, maybe.

29:48.553 --> 29:51.089
If she was murdered here,

29:51.089 --> 29:54.320
her finger was severed here. Where are the

30:07.939 --> 30:09.930
Clever.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.244
Kidnapper washed all the knives.

30:13.244 --> 30:16.805
Why wash the knives,
and leave the wine glasses?

30:17.348 --> 30:20.806
Get those glasses to Greg.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.809
Yeah, looks like someone rip ped
the liner out.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.511
He wrapped her in it.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.002
Must've gotten dumped
when she did.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.762
Watch your step.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.893
Thank you.

31:27.252 --> 31:29.015
All right.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.223
Ran Amanda Freeman's
phone records.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.859
Creature of habit.

31:34.859 --> 31:36.961
Mother, gym,
Logan, pizza.

31:36.961 --> 31:39.497
But the last call made
from that house was
to a cell phone

31:39.497 --> 31:40.862
we traced to Mrs. Logan.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.901
Greg got saliva off
the wine glasses.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.870
Ran the DNA. One was Amanda,
and the other a woman.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.873
Mrs. Logan, maybe.
They would have had
a lot to talk about.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.898
Or fight about.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.887
Looks like a small tear.

32:10.128 --> 32:12.892
Looks more like a slice.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.890
Could've happened when he cut through

32:26.945 --> 32:29.607
Does this look like blood
to you?

32:31.950 --> 32:33.952
If the body was wrapped
with this side...

32:33.952 --> 32:36.512
that's on the outside.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.973
It's not blood.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.271
Yeah.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.851
This is a grease stain.

33:06.851 --> 33:09.251
It's got
an oily residue.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.638
Did you guys clean the table before putting
the curtain

33:27.638 --> 33:28.706
Yeah.

33:28.706 --> 33:31.009
'Cause I think
your evidence got contaminated.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.010
With what?

33:32.010 --> 33:35.213
Oleic acid.
Goes well with jelly.

33:35.213 --> 33:37.010
Peanut butter.

33:38.249 --> 33:39.851
Great.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.019
Hey, Nick?

33:41.019 --> 33:41.986
Yeah?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.155
Have you been eating
peanut butter

33:44.155 --> 33:45.023
in the layout room?

33:45.023 --> 33:46.391
No, man, I hate the stuff.

33:46.391 --> 33:49.554
Well, we found it on the back of that
shower curtain.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.298
Mrs. Logan scolded her son

33:54.298 --> 33:55.833
for eating in the car.

33:55.833 --> 33:57.994
Peanut butter and jelly.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.060
Said her husband just had the car detailed.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.482
I need to take my car
to this detailer.

34:11.482 --> 34:12.717
Not bad.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.185
Come on. You know
that treating the surface

34:14.185 --> 34:18.382
with a carpet cleaner only
pushes the dirt further down?

34:24.195 --> 34:27.027
Warrick, you got
those box cutters?

34:38.976 --> 34:42.036
Did I mention how much
I hate peanut butter?

34:43.081 --> 34:46.050
Mrs. Logan, do you
know Amanda Freeman?

34:46.083 --> 34:48.351
Because she called you
on your cell phone

34:48.351 --> 34:50.047
the day she was murdered.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.056
Could have been
a wrong number.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.458
Then, uh... what
did you talk about

34:53.458 --> 34:55.755
for three minutes
and 55 seconds?

34:56.094 --> 34:59.063
We could compel
a DNA sample

34:59.097 --> 35:00.798
which would confirm that you had

35:00.798 --> 35:02.300
a glass of wine
with her that night.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.234
Is it your intention

35:03.234 --> 35:06.067
to charge my client
with Miss Freeman's kidnapping?

35:06.104 --> 35:08.239
I think you went to your
husband's townhouse...
a townhouse you

35:08.239 --> 35:11.175
probably didn't
know he had... and
a civilized drink

35:11.175 --> 35:13.143
turned into a violent brawl.

35:20.718 --> 35:22.186
You tore down the shower
curtain,

35:22.186 --> 35:24.450
wrapped the body in it.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.093
Cut off her finger,
stuck it in the mint tin,

35:29.127 --> 35:30.795
and left it for your husband.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.130
You transported the body
to the reservoir

35:32.130 --> 35:34.098
in the back of your SUV

35:34.132 --> 35:36.734
where some
of your son's PB and J

35:36.734 --> 35:38.099
made it onto the
shower curtain.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.270
Are you finished?

35:39.270 --> 35:40.138
Diane?

35:40.138 --> 35:42.740
I had my drink
with Miss Freeman.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.909
I listened
to her rant ings

35:44.909 --> 35:46.911
about how she and Roy were getting

35:46.911 --> 35:48.079
That's enough, Diane.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.046
And I set her straight.

35:49.046 --> 35:51.549
Roy was not going
to leave me for her.

35:51.549 --> 35:54.109
He loved his money
more than both of us.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.154
I told her I was
going to evict her

35:56.154 --> 35:58.456
from that tacky
little townhouse,

35:58.456 --> 36:00.117
and then Roy came in.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.683
You should have seen
the look on his face.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.998
And I... I left them
there to work it out.

36:06.998 --> 36:07.899
Okay...

36:07.899 --> 36:10.168
If you don't have
anything else?
One more thing.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.831
Mrs. Logan, can you hold
your hands out, palms up?

36:14.438 --> 36:15.973
Jim, can you
hit the lights?

36:15.973 --> 36:19.602
We don't have time for these games.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.071
Okay, you satisfied?

36:33.224 --> 36:35.215
Look, I can explain.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.170
Look, I put on a mask,

36:46.204 --> 36:48.606
I made some phone calls, I took the money,

36:48.606 --> 36:50.208
but I did not
break any laws.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.210
You killed Amanda Freeman.
Oh, no.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.179
I didn't kill anybody. I didn't even know she

36:55.213 --> 36:56.180
I'm a lawyer.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.549
I work for my client. I did what
he asked me to do.

36:58.549 --> 36:59.984
Your client?

36:59.984 --> 37:01.252
Roy Logan.

37:01.252 --> 37:02.286
What are you saying?

37:02.286 --> 37:05.221
That Mr. Logan paid you to dress up as a

37:05.256 --> 37:06.553
That was my idea.

37:06.591 --> 37:09.185
So Roy Logan set
this whole thing up?
Yes.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.195
It started with a phone call.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.431
I just did what
my client asked.

37:13.431 --> 37:16.059
I just played a part.

37:22.240 --> 37:26.611
So, basically, this was a stage
play written by Mr. Logan.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.246
That's right. Now you got it.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.480
During this elaborate farce

37:29.480 --> 37:30.414
you never thought
to ask him

37:30.414 --> 37:32.550
why he was making you
jump through these hoops?

37:32.550 --> 37:34.819
I don't get paid to ask.
I get paid to do.

37:34.819 --> 37:37.922
What about the money...
the million dollars cash?

37:37.922 --> 37:40.220
Well, Roy was having
marital problems,

37:40.258 --> 37:42.159
so I figured he was just
hiding his assets.

37:42.159 --> 37:43.561
Where's the money now?

37:43.561 --> 37:44.823
In a locker.

37:45.463 --> 37:46.330
At his country club.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.165
Where did Logan
say he was staying?

37:48.165 --> 37:49.233
The Tangiers.

37:49.233 --> 37:50.568
I'll drive.

37:50.568 --> 37:52.729
I'll follow the money.

37:57.141 --> 37:58.276
Mr. Logan?

37:58.276 --> 38:01.473
Open the door. Please.

38:31.942 --> 38:35.275
I'll call down, see if
his car's in the parking lot.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.611
Fat chance.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.218
Son of a bitch.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.517
He had me completely fooled.

38:47.491 --> 38:50.460
I bet that locker's empty, too.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.301
Okay, let's run this.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.338
Amanda was tired of being number
two, so she calls up Mrs. Logan

39:00.338 --> 39:03.398
to discuss her affair
with her husband.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.312
But Mrs. Logan doesn't just
discuss it...

39:08.346 --> 39:10.081
she throws down the gauntlet.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.015
He's not going to leave me for you

39:12.083 --> 39:13.345
(door opening)
He already has.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.887
Amanda broke the only rule.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.117
Don't call the missus.

39:21.292 --> 39:24.028
Now he really has a problem.

39:24.028 --> 39:24.729
Two problems.

39:24.729 --> 39:28.099
His wife is going to leave him,
take half his money,

39:28.099 --> 39:29.367
and he was going to jail.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.036
You got to admit,
his solution was ingenious.

39:32.036 --> 39:35.028
Most killers take their time
planning a murder.

39:35.072 --> 39:38.098
He took his time
covering it up.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.635
48 hours to be precise.

39:50.521 --> 39:53.046
So Logan cleans up
the crime scene

39:53.090 --> 39:54.725
and calls his lawyer.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.394
Asks him to help him
with his little charade.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.596
I mean, what better way
to protect your assets

39:58.596 --> 40:01.030
than to pay a kidnapper
who's already on retainer?

40:01.399 --> 40:04.368
Everything from that point on
was calculated.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.970
The blood on his hands.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.439
He's the last customer
of the day at the bank.

40:08.439 --> 40:10.775
Acting suspiciously.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.610
Driving recklessly.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.045
He knew he'd get hauled
in to the cops.

40:15.045 --> 40:16.376
You bet your ass.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.417
He didn't leave those
sunglasses behind by accident.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.386
His cell phone rang on cue.
The call's for me.

40:27.658 --> 40:30.428
He practically forced that money
into his lawyer's hands.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.329
Out of one pocket
into the other.

40:35.065 --> 40:38.068
I especially liked
the little show he did for us

40:38.068 --> 40:38.936
in the coroner's lab.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.172
Trying to find out
how much we knew.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.764
When? Where?

40:42.807 --> 40:44.308
Why make the map?

40:44.308 --> 40:45.400
Why lead Catherine
to the body?

40:45.443 --> 40:49.903
Because, without the body, Logan
would always be under suspicion.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.416
If not by the police,
by his wife.

40:52.450 --> 40:57.012
So he left these wine glasses
for you to find.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.424
Sure. He wanted us
to suspect the wife.

41:00.424 --> 41:02.793
That's why he
used her SUV

41:02.793 --> 41:04.462
to transport the body.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.996
And he let me mark the money

41:05.996 --> 41:08.466
because he knew that,
eventually, his lawyer would touch it.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.533
Why, though?

41:09.533 --> 41:11.902
The money was
in a suitcase.

41:11.902 --> 41:14.427
A million dollars.
Pretty tempting.

41:15.105 --> 41:17.741
I saw the locker,
I saw Logan's briefcase.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.176
It was too big to fit inside.

41:19.176 --> 41:22.480
His lawyer had to remove
the cash by hand.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.747
How could he possibly know

41:23.747 --> 41:26.450
that Catherine was
going to mark the money?

41:26.450 --> 41:27.151
He didn't.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.620
He probably thought
the bank marked it.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.823
Besides, there's
always fingerprints.

41:32.823 --> 41:36.850
So I did everything in my power
to help him.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.328
Yeah, and he's probably
long gone by now.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.442
Willows.

41:51.442 --> 41:52.409
Yeah.

41:52.409 --> 41:53.911
That's a beautiful car,
that SC-430.

41:53.911 --> 41:57.681
Don't get to see a nice car like
that in these parts too often.

41:57.681 --> 42:00.479
So, when I see one twice
in two days, I notice.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.687
Especially when the driver's
exceeding the speed limit.

42:03.687 --> 42:07.487
Uh-huh. Yeah.

42:14.298 --> 42:16.027
Bravo.

42:23.507 --> 42:26.210
You know, with all that money
on my lap,

42:26.210 --> 42:27.912
we could've driven to Mexico.

42:27.912 --> 42:32.042
That's right.
You're short one mistress.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.921
I got to hand it to you.

42:36.921 --> 42:39.223
That was a brilliant performance.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.491
But then again,
any man

42:40.491 --> 42:43.561
who juggles a wife and mistress
and God knows what else

42:43.561 --> 42:46.063
has to be a pro.

42:46.063 --> 42:51.865
I don't know. You get so used to lying you

42:52.503 --> 42:55.904
Try explaining that
to your son.
