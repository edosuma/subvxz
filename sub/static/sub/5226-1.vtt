There you go, lads! First one's on me.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.142
- Thanks, Paul.
- Cheers.

02:07.242 --> 02:09.977
I definitely missed a couple
of notes in that solo.

02:10.077 --> 02:12.658
I'm tellin' ya, I didn't notice.

02:12.758 --> 02:15.392
- Three rum and coke, please.
- Comin' right up.

02:15.892 --> 02:18.342
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:18.442 --> 02:22.383
- Nice set.
- Thanks a lot.

02:22.783 --> 02:24.375
I like your glasses.

02:24.475 --> 02:25.528
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:25.628 --> 02:29.469
- Not too hipster?
- It's a fine line.

02:31.052 --> 02:32.997
So you're into skiffle?

02:33.097 --> 02:36.575
Yeah. Yeah, well,
didn't have the hair for disco.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.483
- What about you?
- Yeah, love it.

02:41.583 --> 02:43.342
- Really?
- Who wouldn't!

02:43.442 --> 02:45.199
It's not everyone's thing,

02:45.299 --> 02:47.933
but my folks used to play it
all the time, Lonnie Donegan...

02:48.033 --> 02:49.560
She is so great.

02:51.842 --> 02:53.724
Yeah. Right.

02:55.317 --> 02:58.580
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

02:59.180 --> 03:00.652
Lonnie Donegan was a bloke.

03:02.258 --> 03:03.916
Oh, right, yeah.

03:06.850 --> 03:09.017
- I mean, it's no big deal.
- Sure.

03:09.117 --> 03:11.225
- It was nothing.
- I know.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.105
- Cool.
- Yeah.

03:13.205 --> 03:15.483
- Great.
- You know what? It's fine.

03:15.583 --> 03:16.991
Forget it.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.991
Asshole!

03:22.100 --> 03:24.258
You know, somewhere
the ghost of Lonnie Donegan

03:24.358 --> 03:26.742
is wondering why you have
a dick and he hasn't.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.517
Yeah, we're not doing gigs
like this for the money, man.

03:30.617 --> 03:32.449
Do your girlfriends know that, do they?

03:34.125 --> 03:36.870
Just want a bit of honesty.
Is that too much to ask?

03:36.970 --> 03:40.500
Every relationship starts off
with at least one lie.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.442
- You're tellin' me?
- You know what I mean.

03:43.542 --> 03:47.019
For every 'Puppy Love', there's a hundred
'Heard it Through the Grapevine'

03:47.119 --> 03:50.233
or 'Yesterday' or... 'The Sign'.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.647
Ace of Base.

03:53.675 --> 03:57.033
Read the lyrics, man.
It's deeper than you think.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.975
Why can't people be honest
right from the start?

03:59.075 --> 04:02.033
If you have to lie to keep the relationship
goin', then what is the point, okay?

04:02.133 --> 04:05.100
- Save yourself the tears.
- You've had a rough time of it lately.

04:05.200 --> 04:10.267
- It's time to... get back in the saddle.
- Paul, you're his old man. Say something.

04:11.667 --> 04:15.383
- Alan will know when the time is right.
- Thank you.

04:15.483 --> 04:17.733
Maybe stop tellin' 'em
you live with your dad.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.473
What am I gonna do?
Put a table cloth over ya?

04:20.572 --> 04:22.942
Most women expect
a few white lies at the start.

04:24.242 --> 04:26.717
- Here we go.
- Here's the bottom line:

04:27.117 --> 04:30.968
no girl wants a basket of your dirty
underwear on the first date date

04:31.068 --> 04:35.296
and if they do, it's only because
their knickers are even scuzzier than yours

04:35.396 --> 04:39.342
and you do not want to go down
that spiral, my friend.

04:44.499 --> 04:47.322
The night is young, you know?
Let's see what happens.

04:48.566 --> 04:50.418
Good luck.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.942
- So, how's the day looking?
- Busy enough.

06:02.042 --> 06:05.333
They rang in with one free room.
A couple of others around, but not many.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.158
Brilliant. Remind me again
what our job is?

06:08.858 --> 06:09.892
We love Dublin.

06:13.217 --> 06:14.742
Thanks, mum.

06:26.187 --> 06:29.058
- Morning, Beatrice.
- Morning, darling.

06:29.158 --> 06:33.373
- Doesn't he work in the pharmacy?
- He gives me discount on nicotine patches.

06:35.565 --> 06:37.442
Next.

06:39.668 --> 06:41.975
- City centre?
- No!

06:42.572 --> 06:44.075
- Grafton Street?
- No!

06:44.175 --> 06:49.092
It just kept raining 24 hours a day!
How do you do anything here?

06:49.392 --> 06:53.158
And the price of your sandwiches!
Where do I begin?

06:53.858 --> 06:55.693
I'm sure I went to school with you.

06:55.793 --> 06:58.075
- Your name's Alan, right?
- Yeah.

06:58.175 --> 07:00.572
So, for kids?

07:00.672 --> 07:02.503
Next.

07:02.603 --> 07:05.525
How about I just write down
Bono's address?

07:07.112 --> 07:08.592
- Croke Park?
- No.

07:10.758 --> 07:12.833
- Departures.
- Yes!

07:13.133 --> 07:15.079
- Upstairs.
- <i>Gracias</i>!

07:18.883 --> 07:22.733
Meant to say, I think there's something
over there for ya. Just arrived.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.525
Just a bit of fun.

07:32.725 --> 07:35.243
Yeah, yeah, it's...

07:35.343 --> 07:37.309
You had me fooled there for a second.

07:52.192 --> 07:53.368
So?

07:53.468 --> 07:55.536
I go for dinner with this guy
the other night.

07:55.937 --> 07:57.753
- The pharmacy guy?
- Oh, please!

07:57.853 --> 08:01.262
No, this guy, he shows me
a picture of his car on his phone.

08:01.862 --> 08:07.203
It's a 1.9 litre Mazda.
It's a 1.9 litre Mazda!

08:07.303 --> 08:10.529
What is wrong with men here?

08:14.003 --> 08:15.312
Mam.

08:16.237 --> 08:17.722
You Irish are fucked up.

08:20.762 --> 08:22.014
Jesus Christ.

08:34.695 --> 08:36.307
I need an ATM machine.

08:36.407 --> 08:38.562
Sure, yeah,
it's just across the hall there.

08:38.662 --> 08:42.970
I need a room.
Any kind of room. I don't mind.

08:43.970 --> 08:46.137
- I can't see it.
- It's right there.

08:46.237 --> 08:50.857
Where? I can only see a shop over there.
Are you saying it's in the shop?

08:50.957 --> 08:53.536
Should I ask them where it is?

08:54.202 --> 08:55.962
Next.

08:57.318 --> 08:59.626
Am I talking to myself?

09:01.369 --> 09:03.295
Where is it? Where?

09:03.995 --> 09:06.570
There. Right there.

09:11.046 --> 09:13.912
I think my colleague
might be able to help you.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.893
Okay.

09:18.395 --> 09:19.912
Hey!

09:20.212 --> 09:21.762
Hey!

09:23.037 --> 09:25.828
So you didn't totally disappear
off the planet, then?

09:26.745 --> 09:30.982
- Still here.
- You always said Ireland was small.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.395
Yeah, I did warn ya.

09:34.895 --> 09:39.150
- We should probably hug or something.
- Yeah, don't mind.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.141
Okay.

09:41.595 --> 09:44.538
- Are we hugging?
- Sorry. I thought you didn't want to.

09:44.638 --> 09:48.637
- Definitely. Or whatever.
- Okay.

09:58.195 --> 10:02.045
You're more hands on than the Paris
tourist office, I'll give you that.

10:02.145 --> 10:05.435
I've just got to run down
to the bank before lunch.

10:05.535 --> 10:07.881
There was a message for ya.

10:08.562 --> 10:10.034
Thanks.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.303
So... Paris? Did you say Paris?

10:15.403 --> 10:17.812
- Job interview there.
- Cool.

10:17.912 --> 10:19.753
If I get it.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.237
And you work here?

10:22.337 --> 10:26.163
- Yeah, it's grand, you know.
- Where's the toilets?

10:27.637 --> 10:30.796
They're right over there.
Just down there.

10:34.028 --> 10:36.740
That's great. You're doing well.

10:37.228 --> 10:38.753
What are you doing here?

10:38.853 --> 10:43.828
We had an electrical problem en route.
So the plane had to land here.

10:43.928 --> 10:47.695
I'm on standby for a flight tonight
or tomorrow, but I need a room.

10:47.795 --> 10:51.162
- Do you guys do that here?
- Just say the word.

10:54.062 --> 10:56.514
Christ! Sorry!

10:59.188 --> 11:02.953
Flynn's Hotel. They have a room.

11:08.228 --> 11:10.545
It's here.

11:20.727 --> 11:22.322
Don't... It's... I can...

11:22.422 --> 11:24.541
Nah. Nah.

11:29.670 --> 11:31.107
Thanks.

11:31.207 --> 11:33.120
Next.

11:33.869 --> 11:36.520
I should get out of your way.

11:38.037 --> 11:41.433
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- You too.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.553
So you do what to this girl?

11:50.653 --> 11:55.007
We worked together about eight years ago.
I was on a student visa in the States.

11:55.107 --> 11:56.703
You love her?

11:57.403 --> 12:01.873
There was talk of me staying,
maybe getting hitched.

12:03.887 --> 12:04.862
Married.

12:04.962 --> 12:07.078
Do you have to do this
with every girl you met?

12:07.178 --> 12:10.262
It was for a Green Card
to keep me working there.

12:10.362 --> 12:13.970
- You were going to pay to marry her?
- Why the hell would I do that?

12:14.070 --> 12:16.603
Jesus Christ! Your English is shit!
Be fucking clearer?

12:16.703 --> 12:19.987
We wanted to keep things going between us,
you know. See if we had something.

12:20.087 --> 12:23.078
- The Green Card was her idea.
- And you fucked it up?

12:23.478 --> 12:24.820
Why do you think it was me
that fucked it up?

12:24.920 --> 12:27.807
It's 50/50.
More than likely, it's you, no?

12:27.907 --> 12:34.138
We were both twenty. Okay? Very twenty.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.053
- What does it matter now anyway?
- Maybe this is a second chance.

12:37.153 --> 12:39.503
It could be fate.

12:40.070 --> 12:44.012
- You always say you don't believe in fate.
- Yes, because I have thought about it a lot.

12:44.112 --> 12:46.820
You? You could definitely
believe in this bullshit.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.462
Look, it's not like I haven't been able
to stop thinking about her all these years.

12:50.562 --> 12:54.995
I have. I just haven't been able
to forget her either.

12:55.095 --> 12:58.420
And she is somewhere
out there right now.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.796
I didn't exactly leave things
on the best of terms back in the day.

13:02.896 --> 13:05.540
You should've brought her to your place.
Who know what happens?

13:05.740 --> 13:07.503
She's probably got a boyfriend anyway.

13:07.803 --> 13:10.998
- You're so stuck in your pants!
- I'm not stuck in my pants.

13:11.098 --> 13:15.767
Every day you're closer to dying alone with
nothing but a blanket of shit around you.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.603
- A blanket of...
- A blanket of shit, Alan!

13:17.703 --> 13:21.720
That's great. Lovely thing to say to me.

13:53.503 --> 13:55.662
- How's the head?
- Grand.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.537
<i>Hola</i>, Beatrice.

13:59.937 --> 14:03.344
I was thinking about our gig last night.
Maybe we need a new band photo.

14:04.037 --> 14:05.562
What's wrong with the one we have?

14:05.962 --> 14:09.512
Well, I just think we've moved on
from our hillbilly goth phase.

14:09.612 --> 14:12.929
True. Talking of changes...

14:13.029 --> 14:15.145
maybe it's time we started
playing weddings.

14:16.845 --> 14:19.782
You want our band to play Sting, is that
what you want? Fields of fuckin' Gold!

14:19.882 --> 14:22.028
Come on, man, it's been over a year now.

14:22.128 --> 14:25.853
It's not about that. If we go down that road,
there's no more real gigs left.

14:25.953 --> 14:27.712
And you know that, right?
Is that what you want?

14:27.812 --> 14:30.262
We could all do
with a bit of extra dough.

14:30.362 --> 14:32.862
I've been trying to finish the jacks
in me gaff for the last 12 months.

14:32.962 --> 14:34.116
I don't mind,

14:34.216 --> 14:37.137
but Deirdre's getting tired of the
neighbours watching her do her business.

14:37.237 --> 14:41.203
My sister's got us an easy gig.
It's a grand each.

14:41.303 --> 14:44.320
- I'm not playing weddings.
- I can't hear a word you're saying, man!

14:44.420 --> 14:47.507
- Look, you think about it, yeah?
- I'm not...

14:47.607 --> 14:49.902
I'm not playing...

15:24.678 --> 15:26.950
Thanks very much. Bye.

15:30.503 --> 15:32.762
- Hey!
- Hi!

15:33.462 --> 15:35.614
What are you doin' here?

15:37.278 --> 15:41.619
Well, I just couldn't get
that Post-it out of my mind.

15:43.403 --> 15:46.553
Plus it looks like I might get out of here
tonight which would be amazing.

15:46.653 --> 15:49.820
Cool. Well, that's a shame.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.487
I could've shown you around town
a bit if you were staying longer.

15:53.587 --> 15:55.595
- Guess it wasn't meant to be.
- Yeah.

15:56.095 --> 16:02.289
I mean, I don't suppose...
if you want... maybe stay?

16:04.520 --> 16:06.990
What's an evening?
Get a flight tomorrow.

16:07.090 --> 16:10.311
Well, that's a little presumptuous.
I mean...

16:10.411 --> 16:12.837
how do you know
I don't have responsibilities?

16:13.237 --> 16:14.312
Oh, do you?

16:15.412 --> 16:16.695
Nothing comes to mind.

16:16.795 --> 16:19.662
I think I owe you a night out.
No funny business, I promise.

16:19.762 --> 16:22.570
- Then I'm definitely going home.
- Hi, can I help you?

16:22.870 --> 16:25.025
Hi. I'm on standby
for a flight to New York.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.866
I was told I might be able
to get out tonight.

16:26.966 --> 16:29.226
Okay, I'll check for you now.

16:29.696 --> 16:32.869
No, sorry, best we can do
is tomorrow morning.

16:37.820 --> 16:41.078
If you had a summer romance
with someone eight years ago

16:41.178 --> 16:44.968
and they wanted you to stay
an extra night to catch up,

16:45.278 --> 16:47.354
would you do it?

16:47.720 --> 16:50.214
- And no funny business?
- No.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.624
Like nothing?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.221
Well, I can.

16:55.137 --> 16:58.052
- Can he?
- A while ago, maybe.

16:59.737 --> 17:03.803
- Yeah. Life's short. Why not?
- Thanks.

17:03.903 --> 17:06.853
Sure there's no other flights?
I'm kidding.

17:07.453 --> 17:12.021
Or if you slip me 10 euro, I can
get you on a first class seat tonight.

17:12.744 --> 17:15.459
- What?
- I'm kidding also.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.720
Alright.

17:22.362 --> 17:23.288
Bye.

17:26.737 --> 17:31.262
Just so you know, I live with my dad.
I know it's not a big deal, but...

17:31.362 --> 17:33.745
Who doesn't live
with their folks these days?

17:33.845 --> 17:38.188
- You do?
- No! No!

17:40.112 --> 17:43.237
I didn't... I didn't mean...
That sounded like I...

17:43.337 --> 17:45.220
- Fine. It's fine.
- I just...

17:45.320 --> 17:48.083
A lot of my friends ended up in houses
they couldn't pay for and...

17:48.183 --> 17:50.770
- had to move back home.
- Right.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.512
It's just... It's super common,
that's what I'm saying.

17:53.612 --> 17:56.884
You're right. It's all around, you know.

18:00.420 --> 18:04.086
Well, this... definitely...

18:04.186 --> 18:06.491
a temporary thing.

18:07.903 --> 18:09.370
The...

18:09.470 --> 18:12.728
- Living with my dad.
- Oh, right!

18:19.870 --> 18:22.062
- Call it.
- You just say, 'Call'.

18:22.162 --> 18:24.237
- Then call me.
- You want me to ring ya?

18:25.137 --> 18:27.520
You know what I mean!

18:28.562 --> 18:29.787
Here's the man with the plan.

18:29.887 --> 18:31.595
- Alright, Alan?
- Howya, lads.

18:32.095 --> 18:34.418
That's not all he's got.

18:34.518 --> 18:37.382
- This is Alice.
- Hey, guys!

18:39.453 --> 18:40.887
It's alright. She's American.

18:41.589 --> 18:42.891
Okay.

18:43.695 --> 18:46.503
Okay, well, I'll just show you
to your quarters.

18:46.803 --> 18:48.695
There's beers in the fridge
if you want them.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.038
- Okay, great.
- Won't be there for long though!

18:54.012 --> 18:55.728
Fiver says he blows it.

18:58.562 --> 19:02.912
- Some kind of poker night out there?
- Divorced men's support group.

19:03.870 --> 19:05.608
They mainly play poker.

19:11.070 --> 19:14.392
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- Okay.

19:15.828 --> 19:18.072
Great.

19:20.703 --> 19:24.125
No way! You still play barefoot?

19:24.395 --> 19:26.412
I never play barefoot.

19:26.912 --> 19:31.439
I remember your whole sensitive
musician schtick you had going on.

19:34.070 --> 19:37.912
I bet there's not a single Depeche Mode
track among all these records.

19:38.012 --> 19:41.777
If you're gonna love a band, it has to be
based around more than one or two singles.

19:41.877 --> 19:44.006
One or two?

19:48.970 --> 19:53.055
- So it's been...
- Eight years.

19:54.345 --> 19:56.298
Our twenties.

19:56.398 --> 19:59.282
Yeah. How was it for you?

20:00.695 --> 20:03.012
I was on high terror alert
for most of it.

20:03.112 --> 20:06.731
Mainly because some of my friends decided
they had to have babies, like, right know,

20:06.831 --> 20:09.210
- which freaked me out.
- Right.

20:11.612 --> 20:13.831
What about you?

20:14.362 --> 20:18.645
No babies, but it's definitely
had its moments.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.678
Oh, is there somewhere
I could charge this? I just...

20:23.778 --> 20:26.837
I'm supposed to hear about the job.
I don't want to miss the call.

20:26.937 --> 20:29.179
Yeah, sure.

20:31.920 --> 20:35.295
That's the main character.
His name is Victor.

20:35.395 --> 20:38.197
The writer's this French guy, and they
want somebody to illustrate the books.

20:38.297 --> 20:42.337
I'm one of the last two up for the gig.
Could be a big break, finally.

20:42.437 --> 20:44.120
So, what's the story with Victor?

20:44.220 --> 20:47.525
He's one of these kids
that reads everything.

20:47.625 --> 20:51.402
So this mysterious mobile library
comes to his town

20:51.502 --> 20:55.120
and they tell him there's one book left
that he hasn't read,

20:55.220 --> 20:57.353
but that he's not allowed.

20:57.453 --> 21:02.647
So he steals the book and it turns out
that it's a biography of his own life

21:02.747 --> 21:08.020
from the future where he's basically
the most hated man in the world.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.195
That's a bit rough.

21:10.295 --> 21:14.420
And so he's got to try and avoid
this destiny and shape a new one, but...

21:14.926 --> 21:17.772
it turns out it's easier said than done.

21:18.962 --> 21:21.737
That's him fighting the forces of fate.

21:21.837 --> 21:24.195
There's also a seagull named Charles,
who helps him out.

21:24.295 --> 21:27.879
It's basically Harry Potter
but with wine bars.

21:28.279 --> 21:29.970
So what happens in the end?

21:30.874 --> 21:33.224
Not for another ten books.

21:34.178 --> 21:38.092
This is just showing what else I can do.

21:39.420 --> 21:42.001
Life drawings.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.425
This is my apartment.

21:45.953 --> 21:48.095
He just happened to be there?

21:48.780 --> 21:50.970
That's Brian. We're seeing each other.

21:51.070 --> 21:54.243
- He's a lawyer.
- Clearly.

21:54.953 --> 21:56.828
He's actually quite shy.

21:56.928 --> 21:59.920
Oh, right. Not the talkative,
naked lawyer type?

22:02.420 --> 22:04.612
Well, you seem to have it all
figured out, Alice.

22:11.237 --> 22:12.594
You have a girlfriend?

22:16.643 --> 22:18.583
Yeah.

22:19.287 --> 22:21.845
Good for you. What's she like?

22:21.945 --> 22:25.088
Good, grand.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.662
I could draw you some detailed
matchstick figures of her if you like.

22:29.762 --> 22:32.305
That's alright. Wait a second.

22:32.405 --> 22:37.137
You guys don't have some romantic evening
planned? I don't want to crash anything.

22:37.453 --> 22:39.820
No, we don't really celebrate
Valentine's Day.

22:40.820 --> 22:42.826
But you give each other cards?

22:43.023 --> 22:47.035
Yeah. That's just a bit of fun.

22:47.678 --> 22:50.362
- Maybe this was a bad idea.
- No.

22:50.462 --> 22:54.853
No, no, no, no, it's cool. I will give her
a call to see if she's around.

22:54.953 --> 22:57.545
And... you know, we can hook up.

22:57.645 --> 23:00.572
- You're sure?
- Absolutely, yeah.

23:01.445 --> 23:05.212
Okay. I'll just...
I guess I'll just change.

23:05.312 --> 23:07.593
Okay, grand.

23:08.745 --> 23:10.937
Hey, Alan.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.378
It's really good to see you again.

23:15.378 --> 23:17.581
Yeah, you too.

23:21.870 --> 23:24.209
I panicked. Alright?

23:25.312 --> 23:28.295
No, no, no, this is what happens
when I put myself in this kind of situation.

23:29.095 --> 23:31.335
I need your help.

23:32.912 --> 23:37.750
Forty Euros, a meal
and a taxi fare home.

23:37.870 --> 23:41.507
And all the cigarettes
that you can smoke.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.595
Thanks. Thank you.

23:50.478 --> 23:53.218
- Here, moneybags!
- What do you want?

23:53.678 --> 23:56.075
Change in fifties.

23:56.175 --> 23:58.887
Here, grab us one of mine, will ya?

23:58.987 --> 24:01.251
Yep.

24:01.778 --> 24:03.007
Who's the bird?

24:04.520 --> 24:06.828
They can't keep their hands
off me, you know.

24:06.928 --> 24:08.612
- Since when?
- Since forever.

24:09.412 --> 24:10.953
Who is she?

24:11.053 --> 24:13.878
We worked together a few
summers ago in Martha's Vineyard.

24:13.978 --> 24:15.951
She's only here for a couple of hours.
Her flight's in the morning.

24:16.051 --> 24:18.130
All part of the service now, is it?

24:22.320 --> 24:25.757
- Beers in the fridge.
- Oh, thanks, cool.

24:31.695 --> 24:33.663
Would you fuckin' stop!

24:35.462 --> 24:37.320
Alright?

24:38.737 --> 24:41.062
So Alan tells me you guys
get together and stuff?

24:41.462 --> 24:43.912
All you have to do is get married
and divorced to join us, Alice.

24:44.212 --> 24:45.553
Is that all?

24:45.653 --> 24:47.587
I'm gonna change out of these things.
I'll just be a sec.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.603
Okay. Got room for another?

24:50.703 --> 24:54.945
- Sure. But we only play for real money.
- That's a shame. I only have Euros.

24:58.037 --> 25:00.628
A euro and you're in.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.086
Do you guys ever think
about getting remarried?

25:05.402 --> 25:06.394
No!

25:07.370 --> 25:09.250
We've had enough of lies, Alice.

25:10.153 --> 25:15.078
I'm sure men lie just as much
as women do. That's my opinion.

25:15.178 --> 25:16.603
Check.

25:16.703 --> 25:18.420
Check.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.409
Raise.

25:22.184 --> 25:24.887
- I'm out.
- I'm gonna stay for five.

25:26.682 --> 25:27.978
I'll go along.

25:28.278 --> 25:32.162
In my experience, Alice,
men lie because they have to.

25:32.262 --> 25:33.837
Women lie because they can.

25:33.937 --> 25:36.753
A guy once lied to me
and told me his mother was dying

25:36.853 --> 25:39.062
just so he could put his hand up
my sweater. I mean...

25:39.162 --> 25:42.445
that's pretty messed up, but I'm sure
you guys can all beat that, right?

25:43.245 --> 25:45.595
My wife handpicked
our wedding photographer.

25:45.695 --> 25:48.020
She said he was the best, and he was.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.920
Because when he sent me
the wrong photographs,

25:50.020 --> 25:52.570
I could see that they were
handpicking each other.

25:52.670 --> 25:55.595
- It's true.
- Raise you five.

25:57.195 --> 25:59.220
I'm out.

25:59.320 --> 26:02.370
This girl I once knew, her boyfriend
secretly filmed them having sex.

26:02.470 --> 26:06.796
And then, when they broke up,
he accidentally but yet anonymously

26:06.896 --> 26:08.720
sent it to everybody
that she works with.

26:08.820 --> 26:11.770
That being a sixth grade class
that she teaches.

26:14.770 --> 26:16.845
All in.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.604
Well, I'll... call.

26:23.978 --> 26:28.762
With a full house of kings and aces.

26:36.703 --> 26:39.927
- A straight flush beats a house.
- Unbelievable.

26:40.453 --> 26:44.320
Hey, don't feel bad. Whenever there's
a winner, there's gotta be a loser.

26:44.420 --> 26:48.400
I found my wife in bed with a man
dressed in a Wombles suit

26:48.500 --> 26:52.928
while another man in a Barney outfit
stood above them taking a shit.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.653
Alright? Ready to go?

26:59.753 --> 27:02.353
I think so, yeah.

27:02.453 --> 27:05.195
It was really nice to meet all of you.

27:05.295 --> 27:08.362
- You too.
- Yeah, good luck.

27:08.462 --> 27:11.237
- Did you play?
- Yes.

27:11.337 --> 27:12.887
- Win?
- I don't know.

27:12.987 --> 27:15.534
- Cheerio.
- Bye now.

27:28.595 --> 27:31.278
So what did you think
when you saw me at the airport?

27:32.178 --> 27:34.497
I thought,
'She's really let herself go.'

27:35.728 --> 27:37.020
Speak for yourself.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.630
No, I guess I thought...

27:40.399 --> 27:44.170
that it was a shame
that we didn't keep in touch.

27:44.770 --> 27:47.154
Well, if you had stayed
and accepted my proposal?

27:48.128 --> 27:49.694
That was...

27:49.794 --> 27:53.464
a mad idea.

27:54.612 --> 27:57.220
I was just trying to get you
a Green Card.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.172
I know...

27:59.272 --> 28:01.495
but I still had another year in college.

28:01.595 --> 28:04.362
- The sensible decision.
- Yeah. Hard to argue against it.

28:05.495 --> 28:08.028
And then you got that super
awesome internship.

28:08.128 --> 28:10.084
Yeah.

28:10.678 --> 28:12.395
I always intended to come back.

28:14.762 --> 28:17.093
It's cool. It was just
a summer thing. Right?

28:17.193 --> 28:19.126
Right.

28:19.828 --> 28:24.762
Far be it from me to pull you away
from your simple thatch cottage

28:24.862 --> 28:26.995
- to the big city.
- Yeah.

28:27.095 --> 28:29.006
You probably didn't even
own shoes, did you?

28:29.106 --> 28:33.320
- Who can afford them?
- Just a bunch of freckles and a dream.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.595
- And my fighting skills.
- Yeah.

28:35.895 --> 28:38.877
How can you make a living without those?

28:41.003 --> 28:44.695
- It was... it was just an idea.
- Yeah.

28:45.195 --> 28:47.220
Chalk it up to a wild youth.

28:47.320 --> 28:50.002
Think of that tattoo
that you never ended up getting.

28:55.170 --> 28:57.295
- Here we go.
- The job?

28:57.395 --> 28:59.553
Hi, Vicky.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.681
Oh, it's kind of hard to hear you.
Hang on a second.

29:05.153 --> 29:09.266
Hey! Sorry. Yeah. Right.

29:12.237 --> 29:13.788
Okay.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.686
Not close enough?

29:27.553 --> 29:31.021
For someone who doesn't believe in lies,
you're really sticking your toe in.

29:31.121 --> 29:33.462
I know. Just be cool.

29:33.762 --> 29:35.417
Okay. Like you?

29:35.817 --> 29:39.603
The opposite of me.
If I was cool, I wouldn't be doing this.

29:39.703 --> 29:41.992
Where is she?

29:43.195 --> 29:45.154
She just got the job of her dreams.

29:46.053 --> 29:48.536
I love it when good things
happen to beautiful people.

29:49.712 --> 29:54.227
Well, thanks for the opportunity.

29:54.745 --> 29:57.284
Okay, bye.

30:01.053 --> 30:04.795
- Maybe I should tell her the truth.
- This will kick the ass.

30:04.895 --> 30:08.428
- So what if I don't have a girlfriend?
- I'm here. We're fucking doing this!

30:08.528 --> 30:09.978
- This is a bad idea.
- No.

30:10.078 --> 30:12.928
- Yeah. I'll just...
- No. No!

30:13.028 --> 30:16.317
You're a dirty liar now
just like the rest of us. Okay?

30:24.945 --> 30:27.939
I was thinking we should plan
a nice trip.

30:28.978 --> 30:31.900
I was thinking we should go away.

30:42.053 --> 30:44.373
The wine's not very bad.

30:44.473 --> 30:46.929
Two bottles, please.

30:51.862 --> 30:54.757
So you guys work together?
That's gotta be interesting.

30:55.970 --> 30:57.453
It has its moments.

30:57.553 --> 31:03.628
It is hard to control ourselves.
The relationship is very physical.

31:03.728 --> 31:05.500
Yeah.

31:07.653 --> 31:10.528
- How long was it before you...
- Became lovers?

31:10.728 --> 31:12.780
Sure.

31:13.653 --> 31:18.220
- It was, it was pretty soon, yeah.
- It was at a David Bowie concert.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.853
Well, not David Bowie,
but someone who look like him.

31:21.053 --> 31:25.226
What was their name? You know?
The name of the band that was not him?

31:26.778 --> 31:29.796
- Diamond Dogs.
- Yes, the Dogs.

31:29.896 --> 31:32.212
Well... We went just as friends.

31:32.312 --> 31:35.328
The David Bowie man,
he sings 'Life on Mars'

31:35.828 --> 31:41.445
and the crowd, it surge forward,
pressing our bodies together.

31:41.545 --> 31:48.137
And as David sing, we look
into each others' eyes as one.

31:48.237 --> 31:51.061
And then we kissed.

31:52.112 --> 31:54.596
Brilliant. It was a brilliant night.

32:05.478 --> 32:07.895
- You're very good at this.
- Just to make her jealous.

32:07.995 --> 32:10.712
Yeah, I got that when you compared me
to a fully inflamed stallion.

32:10.812 --> 32:13.503
It's Valentine's. The least I can do
is pretend we are fucking.

32:13.603 --> 32:16.382
By the time I am finished,
she will be dying to be with you.

32:16.482 --> 32:18.872
Look, it's not gonna happen.
She's got a boyfriend.

32:18.972 --> 32:21.503
The guy who Wendy left you for.
He must have done this, no?

32:21.603 --> 32:23.932
- Exactly.
- But it seemed to work for him.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.012
I'm not gonna be like the guy
who ran off with my fiancée.

32:30.112 --> 32:32.299
Maybe if you were,
you would not be here.

32:33.012 --> 32:36.575
- Who knows?
- This is obvious, Alan.

32:41.512 --> 32:45.397
Weren't you doing finance? I thought you
were going to be the next Gekko the Great.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.637
Just what the world needs.

32:47.737 --> 32:51.478
The bank is a pool of rats.
He told them to shove it up their asses.

32:51.578 --> 32:54.345
No, no, no, music is Alan's passion.

32:54.445 --> 32:56.053
You quit your job?

32:56.153 --> 32:58.506
Yeah, yeah.
I told them where to stick it.

32:59.612 --> 33:01.309
Aren't you full of surprises.

33:02.612 --> 33:05.053
- What is it you said?
- What?

33:05.153 --> 33:07.687
You know, after you leave?

33:08.278 --> 33:10.828
- Remind me again.
- That's it.

33:10.928 --> 33:16.474
He said to me, 'Beatrice, we must live
in the moment. Not in fucking suits.'

33:17.803 --> 33:22.412
That's cool. You know, I...
I had this consultant gig for a little while,

33:22.512 --> 33:26.094
and it was a pretty sweet deal,
but it just didn't do it for me. You know?

33:26.194 --> 33:28.623
Yeah, right, totally.

33:29.612 --> 33:32.850
And that's it, just like that,
never going back.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.680
I mean, why would you, right?

33:41.928 --> 33:46.172
If we had formed a band,
what would we have played?

33:46.272 --> 33:50.253
- I don't know. Johnny Cash?
- I love Hank Williams.

33:51.053 --> 33:52.095
Since when?

33:52.595 --> 33:55.253
Last couple of years. Why?
You don't think he'd be on my playlist?

33:55.353 --> 33:56.643
No, I'm happy he is,

33:56.743 --> 34:00.520
but I'm pretty sure I played you some
back in the day and you weren't that keen.

34:00.620 --> 34:02.778
I think I'd remember if you did.

34:03.478 --> 34:06.639
- Let's agree to disagree on that one.
- Just that one?

34:07.762 --> 34:12.213
Alan, could I speak to you
for just one second?

34:12.313 --> 34:15.822
It's alright. I was just about
to go to the restroom.

34:17.295 --> 34:19.543
- What's the problem?
- I've met someone.

34:20.570 --> 34:24.980
- You were in the bathroom for two minutes.
- I was coming out, he was going in.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.295
Our eyes, they meet.
Alan, I must leave with him now.

34:28.195 --> 34:30.007
In what universe do you think
this is appropriate...

34:30.108 --> 34:32.708
- I cannot help it!
- Billions of guys out there.

34:32.809 --> 34:36.462
Can't you just let one walk by
with his pants still on?

34:36.562 --> 34:39.322
Alan, this might be love.

34:42.295 --> 34:43.670
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life

34:43.770 --> 34:46.456
with someone you met
outside a toilet, do you?

34:48.152 --> 34:49.911
<i>Buena sera.</i>

34:50.112 --> 34:53.289
Well... well...

34:56.833 --> 34:58.699
- Go on.
- Have fun.

35:03.195 --> 35:05.036
Great.

35:09.537 --> 35:13.095
Hi. Beatrice had to help out a flatmate.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.453
They lost their key,
and they called Beatrice.

35:15.553 --> 35:19.553
She's really sorry she didn't get to say
goodbye. She's really, really sorry.

35:19.653 --> 35:21.703
Alan...

35:30.237 --> 35:32.660
I'm between girlfriends at the minute.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.389
So she...

35:36.200 --> 35:37.837
No.

35:37.937 --> 35:39.793
So...

35:41.537 --> 35:42.570
Why?

35:51.378 --> 35:54.767
Would you like to order
some coffee or dessert?

35:55.028 --> 35:58.039
I think we'll just take the check.

36:07.970 --> 36:12.787
Look, okay, I didn't quit my job.
I was fired.

36:12.887 --> 36:14.608
Any more lies you'd like to clear up?

36:16.028 --> 36:19.165
A couple of months before that,
I was stood up at the altar.

36:20.278 --> 36:22.537
- You were going to be married?
- Yeah.

36:22.637 --> 36:24.912
- You?
- Yeah.

36:25.612 --> 36:30.239
- To a real person?
- Yes, a real person. Wendy.

36:32.195 --> 36:34.012
Wendy.

36:34.112 --> 36:36.195
What?

36:36.295 --> 36:38.616
Nothing. I'm just surprised.

36:39.195 --> 36:42.153
- That I met someone else?
- Sure.

36:42.253 --> 36:45.084
Well, Wendy turned out to be
a lucky escape.

36:45.184 --> 36:47.370
I don't know what I was thinking.

36:47.470 --> 36:51.945
- Once bitten, though...
- It still doesn't explain the fake girlfriend.

36:56.028 --> 36:58.978
Look, okay, I promised you...

36:59.078 --> 37:02.737
that if you ever came here,
I'd give you a great night.

37:02.837 --> 37:07.029
I just wanna make good on that.
If you'll let me.

37:07.762 --> 37:12.512
- 100% honesty.
- Trust me, 100% is impossible.

37:12.612 --> 37:14.931
Well, as close to.

37:15.431 --> 37:19.956
You can ask me anything.
Like first gig, first crush.

37:20.056 --> 37:23.112
- Last time I whacked off.
- Sure.

37:23.212 --> 37:25.603
- What?
- That last one.

37:26.803 --> 37:28.652
Fine.

37:31.512 --> 37:33.607
Last week.

37:35.220 --> 37:39.253
I was on my own
in the apartment for once.

37:39.353 --> 37:43.453
There was a film on the telly.

37:43.553 --> 37:46.278
I had a couple of beers
and one thing led to another.

37:46.378 --> 37:48.217
I'm not proud of it, but there you go.

37:48.317 --> 37:50.115
Who was it?

37:51.112 --> 37:52.535
Helen Mirren.

37:55.153 --> 37:57.530
In 'The Queen'.

37:58.353 --> 38:00.483
You're a fan of the Royal Family?

38:00.583 --> 38:05.094
In the drunken scenario I came up with...
I was doing it for my country.

38:07.237 --> 38:10.809
- Is that enough truth for one night?
- I think we're just getting started.

38:15.012 --> 38:19.653
So you've just completely
taken yourself out of the game?

38:19.753 --> 38:23.428
You could say I'm keeping
the bench warm or something like that.

38:23.528 --> 38:26.137
Maybe you should think
about switching teams.

38:26.237 --> 38:30.714
- Probably wouldn't hurt.
- Maybe initially, but you'd get used to it.

38:32.237 --> 38:36.377
I guess I just haven't met anyone
who's ticked all the boxes.

38:37.378 --> 38:41.203
- I gave up ticking boxes a long time ago.
- Really?

38:41.303 --> 38:44.595
You just need to accept
that love is a lottery.

38:45.595 --> 38:49.100
Well, I don't like those odds.

38:50.253 --> 38:53.092
Well... tough shit.

39:02.012 --> 39:04.624
So is this all people do in Dublin?

39:05.820 --> 39:08.553
There's not that much to do
in the evenings.

39:08.653 --> 39:10.626
Maybe in the summertime...

39:11.226 --> 39:12.746
There must be something.

39:14.195 --> 39:16.947
Play a few games of pool.

39:18.153 --> 39:21.670
- Get a kebab?
- I thought you were a tourist advisor.

39:22.070 --> 39:25.999
We usually advise them
to go somewhere else.

39:26.903 --> 39:28.937
Okay.

39:29.237 --> 39:31.251
Let me think.

39:38.012 --> 39:41.031
<i>Do what you did yesterday</i>

39:41.331 --> 39:44.078
<i>Go on repeating</i>

39:44.178 --> 39:47.577
<i>'Cause my heart's only on fire</i>

39:47.677 --> 39:50.364
<i>When you are the teacher</i>

39:50.987 --> 39:53.694
<i>You take the torch and I</i>

39:54.194 --> 39:57.060
<i>Follow the leader.</i>

39:58.987 --> 40:02.016
<i>You'd be my master</i>

40:02.116 --> 40:04.440
<i>And I'll be your fever</i>

40:10.212 --> 40:15.904
<i>You told me your past
was taken by thieves</i>

40:16.304 --> 40:18.613
<i>Since then you've been running</i>

40:19.752 --> 40:21.973
<i>In search of reliefs</i>

40:22.570 --> 40:26.320
<i>You don't know when it's coming</i>

40:26.420 --> 40:29.333
<i>I don't know either</i>

40:42.803 --> 40:44.228
Nice.

40:45.312 --> 40:48.778
Dad worked here for a while.
We'd have lunch up here sometimes.

40:48.878 --> 40:51.970
If you don't mind me saying so,
he seems to have some...

40:52.070 --> 40:54.828
interesting views on women.

40:54.928 --> 40:58.220
Well, sometimes they don't turn out
the way you hoped, you know?

41:00.045 --> 41:01.518
Women or parents?

41:02.312 --> 41:05.703
Just parents.
They're not meant to be unpredictable.

41:05.803 --> 41:07.151
Okay.

41:13.253 --> 41:15.403
Your folks will be delighted
about the news.

41:18.237 --> 41:20.820
Well, unfortunately...

41:34.970 --> 41:37.449
High security.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.625
- Oh, crap!
- What?

41:54.612 --> 41:56.617
I'm sure someone will be up in a minute.

41:58.537 --> 42:00.870
Hello? Is there anyone there?

42:00.970 --> 42:04.912
Try calling the desk again.
We're on the roof of a hotel.

42:05.012 --> 42:07.545
Well, you know, someone has to hear us.

42:10.920 --> 42:14.175
Can't believe I'm gonna get
double pneumonia for this!

42:14.275 --> 42:16.765
You said the view was nice.

42:16.865 --> 42:21.528
I was being polite. I've already seen two...
three people throwing up down there!

42:22.028 --> 42:23.912
Okay.

42:24.012 --> 42:26.353
I can really see why
you wanted to stay here.

42:27.153 --> 42:32.835
Yeah, yeah. I was really hoping
to live it up here on the roof.

42:42.028 --> 42:45.762
If I still need to say sorry
about the whole Green Card thing...

42:45.862 --> 42:48.437
I think you're overestimating
your impact.

42:48.537 --> 42:50.828
Alright.

42:51.337 --> 42:53.594
There was nothing stopping you
from coming here.

42:55.937 --> 42:57.616
You knew how I felt about you.

42:59.887 --> 43:01.620
- Jesus!
- All right, that's it!

43:01.720 --> 43:03.583
I'm done freezing my ass off out here.

43:05.770 --> 43:07.862
- Get out of the way.
- What are you doin'?

43:07.962 --> 43:10.512
- Get out of the way, Alan.
- Not before...

43:16.253 --> 43:20.539
I knew exactly how you felt about me.
And that's what pissed me off the most.

43:28.428 --> 43:29.839
You should see our summers.

43:40.470 --> 43:42.525
Help!

43:45.112 --> 43:49.087
- Did you hear somebody?
- My eardrums are full of water.

43:51.070 --> 43:54.223
Please! Someone!

44:00.948 --> 44:02.722
Hello?

44:05.637 --> 44:08.703
Help him, please!
Something's gone down the wrong way!

44:08.803 --> 44:11.012
- He's choking.
- Okay, don't worry, here we go.

44:11.112 --> 44:14.045
One, two, three!

44:15.970 --> 44:17.512
Thank you.

44:17.612 --> 44:21.378
- Thank God!
- Oh, I was almost a goner!

44:21.478 --> 44:23.662
I'm sure you've got plenty
of life still left in you!

44:23.762 --> 44:27.139
If there's anything we can do for you.
I just don't know how we can thank you.

44:27.239 --> 44:30.803
- We're grand.
- Oh, please. There must be something.

44:30.903 --> 44:33.520
You wouldn't have
any dry clothes, would you?

44:37.170 --> 44:40.355
We just popped up to drop
our things off, but...

44:40.455 --> 44:43.028
the moment got the better of us
if you know what I mean.

44:43.128 --> 44:47.887
- Well, thanks for these.
- Oh, no. Keep it. It's missing a button.

44:47.987 --> 44:51.884
- You'll have to join us.
- We insist.

44:51.984 --> 44:55.195
- Okay, yeah.
- Wonderful.

44:55.295 --> 44:57.945
- Could you just give us a moment?
- Okay.

44:58.045 --> 45:00.297
Don't take too long.

45:01.795 --> 45:03.512
What are you doin'?

45:03.612 --> 45:05.537
I think they're super sweet
and we should stay.

45:05.640 --> 45:07.270
I'm really not up
for this kind of thing.

45:07.370 --> 45:11.137
Come on. What, are you never gonna go to
another wedding for the rest of your life?

45:12.387 --> 45:14.595
Do you not think they're creepy?

45:14.695 --> 45:17.641
I thought this was my night.

45:19.028 --> 45:21.709
Well, I mean, is it or isn't it?

45:37.453 --> 45:40.437
This is so awesome.
It's like something out of 'Cocoon'.

45:40.537 --> 45:43.212
Are you related
to the bride or the groom?

45:43.312 --> 45:45.725
No. We just borrowed their clothes.

45:52.912 --> 45:56.295
We're going to end up
on a spacecraft full of piss!

45:59.295 --> 46:02.887
I've known Barbara for sixty years.

46:02.987 --> 46:06.030
Yes, sixty years.

46:06.130 --> 46:11.470
We were friends at first. Then life
took us in different directions.

46:11.570 --> 46:16.428
We met wonderful partners and had
a wonderful married life with them.

46:16.528 --> 46:19.595
We assumed we'd had our turn at love.

46:19.695 --> 46:26.137
But then, all these years later...
we found each other again.

46:26.237 --> 46:31.343
Oh, how lucky we are.
How very lucky indeed.

46:31.837 --> 46:34.470
So I would ask you to raise your glasses

46:34.570 --> 46:38.437
and toast to my beautiful wife, Barbara.

46:38.537 --> 46:40.807
To Barbara!

46:48.920 --> 46:53.427
I know it's short notice, but I just wanna
give her the best night I can.

46:53.695 --> 46:56.554
No, it has to be tonight.

46:57.537 --> 47:00.315
Just tell her you'll have sex tomorrow.

47:01.028 --> 47:03.112
If you do it, so will Cian.

47:03.212 --> 47:06.368
Look, there must be a place
we can play. Anywhere.

47:06.468 --> 47:08.962
No, Dad's not working tonight.

47:09.695 --> 47:13.137
Okay, you guys wanna play
weddings, right?

47:15.795 --> 47:19.971
Help me out here and I'll play wherever
and whatever you want.

47:21.312 --> 47:23.445
Even 'Fields of Gold'.

47:24.212 --> 47:27.233
Brilliant. Brilliant.
Brilliant, thanks, Jimi.

47:48.253 --> 47:50.335
You got a camera?

48:11.478 --> 48:13.453
Are you getting them?

48:13.553 --> 48:15.383
Yeah.

48:17.212 --> 48:19.715
It's a keeper, alright.

48:40.612 --> 48:42.920
So I never asked you how Paris was.

48:43.653 --> 48:48.720
It was incredibly romantic
in a very depressing way.

48:48.820 --> 48:51.570
Well, at least Dublin is depressing
for the right reasons.

48:52.070 --> 48:54.552
Brian was supposed to come with me,
but he had to cancel at the last minute.

48:55.870 --> 48:59.387
- Work?
- Yeah, he had this golf thing.

48:59.487 --> 49:01.895
He cancelled a trip
to Paris with you for golf?

49:02.595 --> 49:06.623
Some big client was in town, and he was
put in charge of showing him a good time.

49:07.153 --> 49:10.689
Can't really say no.
It's how you make partner.

49:13.570 --> 49:15.845
So do yous live together?

49:15.945 --> 49:19.229
No. He lives with friends.

49:19.987 --> 49:21.818
College buddies.

49:22.720 --> 49:26.195
One year. My longest relationship.

49:26.295 --> 49:27.910
We mostly see each other on weekends.

49:29.295 --> 49:30.558
Right.

49:30.658 --> 49:34.519
So when you say you're going out a year,
actually being in the same room...

49:34.619 --> 49:38.012
A year of weekends, I guess.

49:38.945 --> 49:43.112
Which adds up to?
A hundred days. Maybe less.

49:43.262 --> 49:47.720
We had a whole summer together.
So that's nearly four months.

49:47.820 --> 49:49.603
- Every day.
- Working, living...

49:49.703 --> 49:51.019
We didn't live together.

49:51.570 --> 49:54.388
Oh, well. We might as well have.

49:57.028 --> 49:59.320
Are you still technically
my longest relationship?

50:00.450 --> 50:02.321
Yeah.

50:02.421 --> 50:04.578
Damn it.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.095
One more for the road?

50:08.695 --> 50:10.940
This road is getting longer
all the time.

50:31.512 --> 50:34.970
She has a boyfriend. We're just mates.

50:35.070 --> 50:39.237
Try and enjoy the night
like some kind of drunk eunuch.

50:39.337 --> 50:41.145
Thanks.

50:51.378 --> 50:53.237
What are you doing?

50:53.337 --> 50:57.720
Oh, come on. I thought it would be
a pity to leave here without a dance.

50:57.820 --> 50:59.879
Oh, come on.

51:44.153 --> 51:45.970
We shouldn't.

51:46.070 --> 51:48.839
Yeah, you're right. I didn't mean...

51:49.528 --> 51:52.132
Maybe we should just go.

51:52.295 --> 51:54.367
Yeah.

52:08.045 --> 52:11.237
- I'm sorry to you. I got a bit carried away.
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.

52:11.737 --> 52:13.357
I mean, it's crazy, right?
It would never work.

52:13.457 --> 52:16.262
- Right.
- I'm over here, you're over there.

52:16.362 --> 52:19.870
And there's the small matter of me
having a boyfriend.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.728
Of course. Yeah, right.

52:21.828 --> 52:24.687
But if you didn't have a boyfriend,
would it really be that far out an idea?

52:24.787 --> 52:26.370
Because you're the one?

52:26.470 --> 52:29.928
I don't know. I'm trying to be 100% honest.
I thought that's what we agreed.

52:30.028 --> 52:33.637
You want me to be honest?
I really like you.

52:33.737 --> 52:37.587
And not in some meaningless
roll in the hay kind of way.

52:39.737 --> 52:44.418
We had something one time,
but we're different people now.

52:45.337 --> 52:48.995
I just thought we could have
this one really cool night in Dublin,

52:49.095 --> 52:54.637
and we could get away from stuff
and, you know, have fun. But I...

52:54.737 --> 52:56.897
Maybe that's not possible.

53:17.528 --> 53:20.117
Oh, for God's sake!

53:21.528 --> 53:23.053
What is it?

53:23.153 --> 53:25.775
Look, let's not leave it like this.

53:26.853 --> 53:30.545
At the very least, we were having
an interesting night before I got stupid.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.868
One more drink?

53:37.028 --> 53:40.595
- Fine, if you'll get me a taxi.
- I promise you won't be disappointed.

53:40.695 --> 53:43.028
- Okay.
- I think.

53:43.128 --> 53:45.829
<i>Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes</i>

53:45.929 --> 53:49.893
<i>The pipes are calling</i>

53:50.658 --> 53:56.667
<i>From glen to glen
and down the mountainside.</i>

54:04.295 --> 54:07.745
- Is this your regular hangout?
- You're one place as good as the next.

54:07.845 --> 54:10.595
We passed, like, 50 bars
on the way here.

54:10.695 --> 54:14.592
I think you're taking my advice
about switching teams to heart.

54:16.153 --> 54:18.104
Listen, I'll be back in a sec.

54:24.987 --> 54:27.845
Man, if I'm not back in 30 minutes,
my relationship is over.

54:27.945 --> 54:29.237
I owe you big time.

54:29.337 --> 54:32.663
Actually you owe Julie,
that tasty morsel at the bar.

54:32.763 --> 54:34.678
She got us in at the last minute.

54:34.778 --> 54:37.201
- Did you get the bass?
- They not here?

54:39.620 --> 54:41.140
- Been here long?
- What?

54:41.240 --> 54:44.845
- Been here long?
- Five minutes.

54:44.945 --> 54:48.440
- Did someone...
- No, we brought our own glow sticks.

54:51.628 --> 54:54.276
Will you stay for a pint?

54:55.120 --> 54:57.358
My shout.

54:58.020 --> 54:59.945
Grand.

55:12.070 --> 55:16.287
Okay, and now for our final
last minute competitors

55:16.387 --> 55:20.412
for the 'Talent Trophy'...
bringing the fifties back to life

55:20.512 --> 55:25.961
without the use of Viagra,
please welcome 'The Nightlinks'.

55:31.528 --> 55:36.720
Hi, everyone. This is a little song
about love and all its temposity.

55:36.820 --> 55:39.696
Sing it with us if you know the words.
I'm talking to you, Alice.

55:42.212 --> 55:46.820
<i>I've tried so hard, my dear,
to show that you're my every dream,</i>

55:46.920 --> 55:51.530
<i>Yet you're afraid each thing I do
is just some evil scheme</i>

55:51.630 --> 55:56.153
<i>A memory from your lonesome past
keeps us so far apart</i>

55:56.253 --> 56:01.570
<i>Why can't I free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold, cold heart?</i>

56:02.762 --> 56:05.070
- No.
- Yes.

56:10.587 --> 56:14.812
<i>Another love before my time
made your heart sad and blue</i>

56:15.112 --> 56:19.778
<i>And so my heart is paying now
for things I didn't do</i>

56:19.878 --> 56:24.328
<i>In anger, unkind words are said
that make the teardrops start</i>

56:24.528 --> 56:29.032
<i>Why can't I free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold, cold heart?</i>

56:45.670 --> 56:47.442
I don't remember the lyrics.

56:49.153 --> 56:53.587
<i>You'll never know how much it hurts
to see you sit and cry</i>

56:53.987 --> 56:58.448
<i>You know you need and want my love,
yet you're afraid to try</i>

56:58.548 --> 57:03.195
<i>Why do you run and hide from life
To try it just ain't smart?</i>

57:03.295 --> 57:07.628
<i>Why can't I free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold, cold heart?</i>

57:08.128 --> 57:12.550
<i>There was a time when I believed
that you belonged to me,</i>

57:12.650 --> 57:17.308
<i>But now I know your heart
is shackled to a memory</i>

57:17.408 --> 57:21.770
<i>The more I learn to care for you,
the more we drift apart</i>

57:22.170 --> 57:26.533
<i>Why can't I free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold, cold heart?</i>

57:48.420 --> 57:51.622
- Well done, Alan!
- Well done, Alan!

57:59.170 --> 58:01.845
There's always next week.

58:01.945 --> 58:03.828
I'm not even gonna say it.

58:03.928 --> 58:08.070
Look, we're your mates. We're gonna
support any decision you make here.

58:08.170 --> 58:11.395
But if you don't dick this girl,
you're lettin' us all down.

58:11.495 --> 58:12.854
- Lads...
- For the record,

58:12.954 --> 58:16.328
I disagree with using 'dick' as a verb,
but I think the sentiment is about right.

58:16.428 --> 58:21.803
It's not just me you're lettin' down.
Not just me or your Da or Jimi.

58:21.903 --> 58:24.845
I don't mind. I can take the blows.

58:24.945 --> 58:29.036
Now is not the time
to be a cuddly hobbit,

58:29.136 --> 58:35.285
singing weak ass songs about how
ginger ale makes your tummy feel all funny.

58:35.385 --> 58:40.487
Now, my friend, is the time
to sex panther the shit out of this.

58:40.887 --> 58:43.494
- What are you talking about? I've...
- What?

58:43.594 --> 58:45.587
I'm not taking advice
from you ever again.

58:45.687 --> 58:49.312
You always say the best way to get
a girl is to walk away from them.

58:49.412 --> 58:53.445
- Yeah, make them come to you.
- That's a classic move in fairness.

58:53.545 --> 58:56.012
Four years in college,
they never followed.

58:56.112 --> 58:58.928
Jesus! I have fallen arches?

58:59.028 --> 59:02.009
Who's going to follow someone
with corrective footwear?

59:02.109 --> 59:06.512
I mean, at least I had an excuse.
What's yours?

59:06.612 --> 59:09.345
I made a move. It didn't happen.

59:09.445 --> 59:13.114
And she's got a boyfriend. End of story.

59:18.028 --> 59:21.295
It's a great show, guys.
We'll take care of this stuff.

59:21.395 --> 59:23.437
- Thanks, Dad.
- See you at home.

59:23.537 --> 59:24.687
Good luck.

59:24.787 --> 59:28.373
We were never here, right?
Lovely pint, though.

59:30.753 --> 59:32.637
Are you sure we can't
convince you to join the band?

59:32.737 --> 59:35.487
I'm just gonna have to be
an honorary member.

59:35.587 --> 59:41.553
Well, this has been great, you know?
Really has. You're...

59:44.987 --> 59:48.387
- Did I say something wrong?
- That's just something he does.

59:48.487 --> 59:50.487
Right, I'm off.

59:50.587 --> 59:54.528
I'm gonna have to break out the emergency
choccies to smooth this one over.

59:54.628 --> 59:55.921
Be good.

59:59.937 --> 01:00:04.857
- Another boring night in Dublin.
- Same old, same old.

01:00:04.957 --> 01:00:07.095
- So I guess you were right.
- About what?

01:00:07.195 --> 01:00:10.970
Hank Williams. That was the song
you played me, wasn't it?

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:13.878
I don't want to say I told you so.

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:19.095
Oh, my God.
You are absolutely covered in glitter!

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:21.070
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.187
Were you making out with one
of those drag queens or something?

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:25.569
Best I ever got.

01:00:26.528 --> 01:00:31.637
Hey, that was so great.
Valentine's Day in a gay bar. Drama!

01:00:31.737 --> 01:00:33.920
- You were brilliant too.
- Thanks.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.887
Cool. So... what are you guys up to now?

01:00:38.987 --> 01:00:43.695
'Cause there's a house party over in
the Northside, and it's going to be deadly.

01:00:43.795 --> 01:00:47.270
- You've got your flight in the morning.
- Yeah, and it's past our bedtimes.

01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:49.920
Jesus, how old are you guys?

01:01:47.112 --> 01:01:48.703
So what are you guys studying?

01:01:50.128 --> 01:01:52.161
Engineering.

01:01:53.345 --> 01:01:55.128
That must be interesting.

01:01:55.928 --> 01:01:57.553
Not really.

01:01:57.653 --> 01:02:01.028
Well, you must be looking forward
to graduating then?

01:02:01.128 --> 01:02:04.070
No. Not really.

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.737
No jobs.

01:02:05.837 --> 01:02:08.407
Probably have to emigrate.

01:02:09.528 --> 01:02:12.228
What did you say was in that again?

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:15.345
- What did you say was in that again?
- Hash.

01:02:15.445 --> 01:02:19.053
It's strong. We don't usually get
hash back home. It's mostly grass.

01:02:20.373 --> 01:02:23.213
Grass is class.

01:02:23.862 --> 01:02:25.953
Good shit.

01:02:43.837 --> 01:02:46.195
You definitely have to come to my 21st.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.848
- You a nineties baby?
- You bet.

01:02:49.487 --> 01:02:52.569
- What about you?
- '83.

01:02:54.228 --> 01:02:58.428
- That's, like, pre-everything.
- Well, not everything.

01:02:58.528 --> 01:03:02.353
So, what's the story with your woman?
Are you two, like, an item or...

01:03:02.453 --> 01:03:06.908
Yeah, actually we are.
We're just on a little break at the moment.

01:03:07.008 --> 01:03:09.078
For how long?

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.212
Eight years.

01:03:11.637 --> 01:03:14.353
What? He do the dirt
on you or something?

01:03:14.453 --> 01:03:16.295
- Totally.
- She's joking.

01:03:16.395 --> 01:03:18.803
Yes, but you did convince me
that you were gonna come back,

01:03:18.903 --> 01:03:21.112
which I believed
against my better judgment.

01:03:21.212 --> 01:03:23.304
And then, you changed your mind
at the last second.

01:03:24.428 --> 01:03:26.287
So you are mad that I didn't come back?

01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:28.828
I'm not mad.
I think you want me to be mad.

01:03:29.128 --> 01:03:31.526
Why would I want you to be mad?

01:03:31.626 --> 01:03:33.128
I don't know.

01:03:33.528 --> 01:03:38.684
Hey, I'm gonna go and be twenty
somewhere. So... good luck.

01:03:40.228 --> 01:03:42.145
- Where's this coming from?
- Where's it coming...

01:03:42.245 --> 01:03:44.887
Alan, if you're not happy
with where you are in life,

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.763
you should be doing something about it.

01:03:46.863 --> 01:03:49.945
Well, it's easy for you to say, Alice.
You know, you seem to be doing okay.

01:03:50.045 --> 01:03:54.153
Oh, really? What's French
for 'We don't like your drawings'?

01:03:54.253 --> 01:03:55.428
What do you mean?

01:03:55.528 --> 01:03:58.632
I didn't know what it was either
until tonight.

01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:08.928
You must think I'm such a fucking idiot.

01:04:09.128 --> 01:04:11.960
No, not at all.

01:04:23.128 --> 01:04:26.352
God, we look so fucking stupid.

01:04:29.295 --> 01:04:32.270
I think your drawings are great, Alice.

01:04:33.212 --> 01:04:34.753
I've had two.

01:04:34.853 --> 01:04:36.678
- Two?
- Two.

01:04:36.778 --> 01:04:41.345
- Two what?
- Jobs. Drawing in 18 months.

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:45.021
And now I'm... I'm...

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:48.325
I'm fucked!

01:04:49.028 --> 01:04:50.437
You okay?

01:04:52.137 --> 01:04:53.828
Bazzer, it's the guards!

01:04:54.028 --> 01:04:56.345
Hide the feckin' yokes!

01:04:56.445 --> 01:04:58.943
- Oh, my God!
- Where are you goin'?

01:05:04.828 --> 01:05:05.753
Alice!

01:05:05.853 --> 01:05:08.845
Alan, I have a plane to catch in the morning.
I'm not spending the night in jail.

01:05:08.945 --> 01:05:11.245
Jail? We don't get blamed
for anything here.

01:05:11.345 --> 01:05:12.487
It's not safe!

01:05:12.587 --> 01:05:14.653
I think that stuff's making you
a little bit paranoid.

01:05:15.053 --> 01:05:17.220
- What the fuck?
- She's freaking out. The cops are here.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.594
- What?
- What if I fail a drug test?

01:05:21.097 --> 01:05:24.620
What are Irish prisons like? I've never
even seen one, not on TV or anything!

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.837
Why is that? Is there something...

01:05:28.053 --> 01:05:30.387
Do they make you do Irish dancing
and shit? Because I can't dance!

01:05:30.487 --> 01:05:33.678
I can't dance at all!
What are you people hiding?

01:05:33.778 --> 01:05:36.187
- Hey! Calm down!
- I am calm!

01:05:36.287 --> 01:05:37.978
Do you trust me?

01:05:43.485 --> 01:05:45.721
One, two, three.

01:06:22.087 --> 01:06:24.578
Maybe show a bit of leg?

01:06:24.678 --> 01:06:29.462
Yeah. I could flash out a man boob,
but it might cause an accident.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:33.179
We'll get home eventually.

01:06:40.253 --> 01:06:43.579
If it's any consolation about the job...

01:06:45.325 --> 01:06:50.587
I'm pretty sure now is the best time
for things not to work out.

01:06:50.687 --> 01:06:52.612
You think?

01:06:52.712 --> 01:06:55.945
Who wants to be dealing
with this crap in their forties?

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:57.991
I mean,

01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:00.984
you're forty...
which has its own problems.

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:05.517
I've been stood up at the altar.

01:07:06.945 --> 01:07:09.137
Epic fail.

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.018
I was devastated,

01:07:12.918 --> 01:07:18.528
but that is so much better than trying
to break up 20 years later.

01:07:18.628 --> 01:07:22.703
And arguing over who owns
which Lonnie Donegan album.

01:07:22.803 --> 01:07:24.845
He's great.

01:07:26.087 --> 01:07:27.957
Yeah.

01:07:30.495 --> 01:07:32.594
I should've known Wendy wasn't a keeper.

01:07:38.445 --> 01:07:41.062
We picked the best time
to fuck this shit up is what I mean.

01:07:41.162 --> 01:07:42.387
Right.

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:55.345
I guess a part of me always thought
that maybe you just met someone else,

01:07:55.445 --> 01:08:01.230
and the internship thing
was just a cover.

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:04.944
I was just really scared.

01:08:07.528 --> 01:08:10.987
My family was here. My friends.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:14.712
My... career.

01:08:17.903 --> 01:08:20.925
Probably another year...

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:27.639
before I even... thought of anyone else.

01:08:29.987 --> 01:08:32.363
Same here.

01:08:35.353 --> 01:08:36.895
Have you seen you?

01:08:40.545 --> 01:08:43.595
I'm not saying I haven't made up for it.

01:08:47.228 --> 01:08:50.515
We learn nothing from success.

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:54.809
- To failure.
- Absolutely.

01:08:57.170 --> 01:09:00.903
- Is this tour of Dublin over?
- If you want.

01:09:01.002 --> 01:09:03.368
And if I don't?

01:09:04.127 --> 01:09:06.523
I know just the place.

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:08.003
- Have you got enough?
- Yeah. Just about. You?

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:10.424
Yeah, grand.

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:14.295
Can't believe you've never heard
of one of these before.

01:10:14.395 --> 01:10:18.920
Yeah, well, we've had electricity
for a while. So...

01:10:21.987 --> 01:10:23.803
- Jesus!
- Is it too hot?

01:10:23.903 --> 01:10:25.687
Your feet are like ice!

01:10:26.944 --> 01:10:28.874
Sorry.

01:10:35.487 --> 01:10:37.213
Good night.

01:10:39.487 --> 01:10:41.846
Yeah, sleep tight.

01:10:47.128 --> 01:10:49.104
Why is it ribbed?

01:10:52.395 --> 01:10:54.736
It just is.

01:10:55.353 --> 01:10:57.812
My Granny's one was the same.

01:10:58.112 --> 01:11:01.577
It seems like a lot of trouble
for a bottle.

01:11:23.228 --> 01:11:24.808
Alan.

01:11:53.353 --> 01:11:56.828
Alice! Alice, what time's your flight?

01:11:56.928 --> 01:11:58.267
What time's your flight?

01:11:58.367 --> 01:12:01.345
- What?
- What time's your flight?

01:12:01.745 --> 01:12:03.028
Oh, fuck!

01:12:42.453 --> 01:12:46.553
Well, I guess we should be used
to saying goodbye at this stage.

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:48.687
Yeah.

01:12:49.187 --> 01:12:52.253
- Let's stay in touch, though, this time.
- Definitely.

01:12:52.353 --> 01:12:54.645
- What's her name?
- Alice Rothmayer.

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:56.282
- 'Roth' what?
- Rothmayer.

01:12:57.082 --> 01:12:59.303
Okay, I've got you a seat,
but you really need to go now.

01:12:59.403 --> 01:13:01.312
And no more funny business.

01:13:01.412 --> 01:13:03.642
Thanks.

01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:22.593
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

01:13:24.087 --> 01:13:26.353
Take care of yourself.

01:13:26.453 --> 01:13:28.000
You too.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.420
You forgot your passport.
You have to go now.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.762
- I can bring you through.
- Okay, thanks.

01:13:32.862 --> 01:13:35.726
- Take the jacket.
- No, no, keep it. It's not even mine.

01:13:36.403 --> 01:13:39.612
- You really need to go now.
- Okay.

01:13:41.312 --> 01:13:43.322
Alice.

01:13:48.087 --> 01:13:50.120
Thanks for a great night.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.178
It's what I'm here for.

01:14:32.062 --> 01:14:36.417
You know, the first date I ever had
with your dad was such a disaster.

01:14:36.517 --> 01:14:39.303
All he could talk about was his dog.

01:14:39.987 --> 01:14:44.820
A couple of day later, he rings. I tell him,
'I don't think I can do another dog evening.'

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.045
He asked me to give him another chance.
We met up a week later.

01:14:49.145 --> 01:14:52.737
Now, he'd spotted some books
I had in my bag before.

01:14:52.837 --> 01:14:57.287
So in that week, he'd gone out
and bought them and read them.

01:14:57.887 --> 01:15:00.528
I don't think we talked about dogs once.

01:15:00.628 --> 01:15:03.046
Well, maybe once.

01:15:12.287 --> 01:15:17.316
You can never tell how anything's
going to turn out. Nobody knows.

01:15:19.453 --> 01:15:21.610
But a good memory is worth something.

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:24.406
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:15:38.553 --> 01:15:40.540
Oh, shit!

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.473
I'm so proud of you, kiddo.

01:15:45.145 --> 01:15:47.350
Why? I only ever mess things up.

01:15:48.587 --> 01:15:51.412
You lose when you stop trying.

01:15:51.512 --> 01:15:52.945
Fuck it.

01:15:53.545 --> 01:15:57.678
- You go home and get some rest.
- No, it's alright. It's busy.

01:15:57.778 --> 01:16:00.070
That's an order.

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:17.031
<i>Are you getting them?</i>

01:16:17.131 --> 01:16:19.005
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:16:19.862 --> 01:16:22.916
<i>It's a keeper, alright.</i>

01:16:28.812 --> 01:16:32.145
<i>Final call on Aer Lingus
flight EI105 to New York.</i>

01:16:32.245 --> 01:16:35.707
<i>This flight is now closing
through Gate 410.</i>

01:16:42.212 --> 01:16:44.795
Here's the great romancer.

01:16:44.895 --> 01:16:46.345
You guys not working today?

01:16:46.445 --> 01:16:49.537
Couldn't possibly face work
after that shite last night.

01:16:49.637 --> 01:16:52.045
Actually, there's still
some beers in the fridge.

01:16:52.145 --> 01:16:54.456
Bring us one of mine, would ya?

01:17:07.503 --> 01:17:10.254
Did Alice get off okay?

01:17:11.412 --> 01:17:13.232
Yeah.

01:17:14.778 --> 01:17:18.199
That's not one of mine.
You know the beer I like.

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:21.937
- Jeez, would you look at yourself?
- What?

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:24.562
Look, not all women out there are trying
to screw you over every time, okay?

01:17:24.662 --> 01:17:26.637
Some of them, maybe,
but there are lots of nice ones.

01:17:27.037 --> 01:17:28.903
Once bitten, twice shy.

01:17:29.003 --> 01:17:30.928
Joe, your wife left ya
because you're the kind of guy

01:17:31.028 --> 01:17:33.715
that can fart his favourite TV theme tune,
and somewhere along the line,

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:36.503
that wasn't good enough for her.
Now, I'm sorry, but it's true.

01:17:37.103 --> 01:17:41.286
Look, it's all painful, but if you're not in,
you can't win. You gotta take a chance.

01:17:41.962 --> 01:17:44.404
You can't just give up.

01:17:49.003 --> 01:17:50.885
A bit harsh.

01:17:56.453 --> 01:17:59.587
- What are you doin'?
- What does it look like I'm doin'?

01:17:59.687 --> 01:18:03.088
- Alan, this is crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

01:18:03.188 --> 01:18:06.887
- What if she's a looper?
- Then I'll have a story to tell.

01:18:06.987 --> 01:18:09.755
It's a long way to go.

01:18:10.287 --> 01:18:12.624
I'll let you know how it got on.

01:18:12.724 --> 01:18:14.570
Sorry, Joe, again.

01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:16.803
It was the theme tune from 'Frasier'.

01:18:16.903 --> 01:18:19.397
It's not easy to fart
'tossed salad and scrambled eggs'.

01:18:19.497 --> 01:18:21.637
- Here, take some money.
- Dad, you've given me enough.

01:18:21.737 --> 01:18:24.770
Think of it as relationship insurance.

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:27.574
There's always a room for you here.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:32.105
I hope it works out for ya.

01:19:34.312 --> 01:19:37.129
I have to go back.

01:19:39.512 --> 01:19:41.966
I don't have to stay here.
