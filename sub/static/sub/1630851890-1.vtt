00:26.026 --> 00:27.402
Good evening, Seattle.

00:27.485 --> 00:31.948
An international manhunt
for the so-called Green River Killer.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.616
Not just America's most wanted,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.703
but perhaps the most dangerous
single killer in the world.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.470
Dave, I know you have something that,

00:53.553 --> 00:56.139
if this Green River Killer is watching,
you'd like to say.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.476
You know, I've worked this case
for over six years now…

00:59.559 --> 01:02.604
-
-…and I feel very confident

01:02.687 --> 01:06.107
that someone will soon
be leading us to you.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.948
This nightmare will not end.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.952
It still haunts you
during every waking hour.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.542
It's time for us to talk.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.611
<i>The shock</i>
<i>in this neighborhood continues.</i>

04:38.695 --> 04:40.989
 <i>The three latest victims</i>
<i>were found yesterday.</i>

04:41.072 --> 04:44.742
<i>Police have been combing the banks</i>
<i>of the Green River looking for any clues</i>

04:44.826 --> 04:47.870
<i>as to who may have killed</i>
<i>five women in the last month.</i>

04:52.208 --> 04:54.419
Our modern-day paradise has a serpent.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.462
A serpent in human form,

04:56.546 --> 04:57.755
the Green River Killer.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.859
<i>Somewhere in our midst</i>
<i>is a cold-blooded killer.</i>

14:07.763 --> 14:09.223
<i>For nearly a month now,</i>

14:09.306 --> 14:11.642
<i>undercover officers</i>
<i>have been stationed in this area</i>

14:11.725 --> 14:14.562
keeping a 24-hour watch on Melvyn Foster,

14:14.645 --> 14:16.939
who lives just up the road from here.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.399
Are you scared at all?

14:20.192 --> 14:21.277
Scared? No.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.405
Fright is for the guilty.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.709
<i>What's the bottom line here?</i>
<i>Did you kill all those women or what?</i>

14:39.086 --> 14:41.755
No, but I wish I did.
I wish I did know who did.

14:42.798 --> 14:43.799
Because, uh…

14:46.468 --> 14:48.053
I'd put a stop to him.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.063
<i>It's been over one year</i>
<i>since investigators found</i>

15:39.146 --> 15:42.066
<i>the first skeletal remains</i>
<i>of the Green River murders.</i>

15:42.149 --> 15:44.777
<i>Last night, an elderly man</i>
<i>picking apples in this field</i>

15:44.860 --> 15:47.446
<i>found bones scattered over a 20-foot area.</i>

15:51.325 --> 15:53.786
<i>Three skeletons</i>
<i>have been found on port property.</i>

15:53.869 --> 15:56.163
Possible victims
of the Green River Killer.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.086
<i>The Green River Task Force now</i>
<i>includes another possible murder victim,</i>

16:02.169 --> 16:04.713
<i>discovered near 54th Avenue</i>
<i>and Star Lake Road.</i>

16:19.228 --> 16:22.189
<i>The Green River Task Force</i>
<i>will be expanded next month.</i>

16:22.272 --> 16:24.733
<i>Fifteen officers</i>
<i>and ten detectives will join the case,</i>

16:24.817 --> 16:26.902
<i>more determined than ever</i>
<i>to catch the killer.</i>

18:35.447 --> 18:37.783
<i>People are frightened,</i>
<i>and we open the paper,</i>

18:37.866 --> 18:40.911
<i>and all we see are bodies</i>
<i>and bones being found.</i>

18:40.994 --> 18:42.704
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>there is speculation</i>

18:42.788 --> 18:46.458
<i>that investigators on the Green River case</i>
<i>are back to square one.</i>

18:53.549 --> 18:55.801
How close
are you to catching this killer?

18:55.884 --> 18:58.595
Um, that's kind of a hard question
to answer right now.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.264
Um, we're still working on it,

19:00.347 --> 19:03.142
and until we catch him,
we really won't know how close we are.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.645
Is there any reason to believe
that this person may kill again?

19:06.728 --> 19:09.231
 Um, in serial investigation,

19:09.314 --> 19:12.484
we find that the serial killer continues
until he's caught.
