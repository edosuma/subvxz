12:20.906 --> 12:22.198
OKAY, YOU GOT NOTHING.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.951
HUH? YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, I GOT NOTHING.

12:27.288 --> 12:31.124
OKAY, FINE.
I DON'T CARE.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.002
SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT
SUMMER CAMP, RIGHT?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.462
FINE.

12:35.629 --> 12:38.506
THEY CALLED ME
DR. PEE PEE.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.469
I COULDN'T SLEEP
ON THE TOP BUNK

12:42.636 --> 12:44.971
AND I WAS 10, SO...

12:45.139 --> 12:48.099
YOU KNOW, WHO CARES, I'M
DR. PEE PEE. I'M...

12:50.102 --> 13:04.616
DR. PEE PEE.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.244
YOU ARE SO DR. PEE PEE.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.498
OH, REALLY.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.918
BIG CHIEF BROWN BOTTOM.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.466
I'M SORRY.
SORRY, MAN, SORRY.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.511
JUST...
EVERYONE SHUT UP.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.849
HEY, HOW WAS DINNER?

13:30.017 --> 13:31.100
FINE.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.560
EXCEPT YOUR FATHER
WOULDN'T SHUT UP ABOUT

13:32.728 --> 13:33.853
THAT STUPID NECKLACE.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.231
LOOK, KITTY, OBVIOUSLY
SOMETHING'S GOING ON HERE.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.858
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL ME WHAT IT IS?

13:39.026 --> 13:40.235
DID YOU LOSE IT?

13:40.402 --> 13:41.528
NO.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.196
DID YOU LEND IT
TO SOMEBODY?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.656
NO.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.032
THEN WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

13:46.200 --> 13:46.825
I HAWKED IT, OKAY?

13:46.992 --> 13:50.495
I HAWKED IT, I PAWNED IT,
I HAWKED IT.

13:52.164 --> 13:56.334
YOU PAWNED MY DEAD
MOTHER'S NECKLACE?

13:57.837 --> 14:00.088
YES.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.715
AND I'M NOT SORRY 'CAUSE WE
GOT GROCERIES FOR IT.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.133
SO, I'M NOT SORRY.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.928
I'M NOT SORRY, AND
I DON'T FEEL BAD.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.144
OH, ERIC,
I FEEL SO BAD.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.648
MOM, YOU FEEL BAD?

14:18.816 --> 14:22.235
LAURIE TOLD EVERYONE
ABOUT DR. PEE PEE.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.488
OH, HONEY,
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.032
THAT'S CUTE.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.827
OH, PLEASE, I HAVE TOLD THAT
STORY TO SO MANY...

14:30.995 --> 14:33.705
MOM!

14:35.749 --> 14:39.127
I DIDN'T TELL THAT STORY
TO ANYBODY.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.011
SO, THEN, AFTER I FINISHED
PUTTING ALL MY PICTURES

14:48.178 --> 14:50.138
OF MICHAEL IN MY
SPECIAL MICHAEL BOX,

14:50.306 --> 14:53.516
I REALIZED THAT I'M
SO TOTALLY OVER HIM.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.644
YOU LIAR.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.396
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.648
IF YOU KEEP STUFFING YOUR FACE
LIKE THIS, YOU'RE GONNA GET...

15:00.816 --> 15:04.110
DON'T YOU DARE
SAY IT, YOU BITCH.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.196
FAT.

15:07.364 --> 15:11.576
NO.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.209
YEP, I'VE ALMOST
FINISHED MY FIFTH PIE,

15:20.377 --> 15:23.254
AND I'M STILL
COMPLETELY OVER MICHAEL.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.881
DON'T.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.466
STOP.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.009
WAIT.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.510
MMM.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.305
BLUEBERRY.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.183
HMM.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.353
I'M FEELING
KIND OF WEIRD.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.359
OH, NO, WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO ME?

15:52.701 --> 15:54.619
OH, MY GOD.
OH, GOODNESS.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.705
OH, GRACIOUS,
OH, MY!

15:58.457 --> 16:00.959
NO MORE PIE FOR YOU.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.672
OKAY, LET'S GO,
JACKIE.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.926
NO! AAH! UNH!

16:12.846 --> 16:14.097
SURE.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.766
SUCK IT IN,
JACKIE.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.477
OH, MY GOD,
DONNA, I'M SCARED.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.187
I HAVE TO
CONTROL MYSELF.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.565
OKAY, WELL, THEN LET'S START BY
YOU HANDING DONNA THE JERKY.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.777
BACK OFF, YOU AMAZON.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.030
LOOK, I JUST
NEED MORE TIME.

16:31.615 --> 16:32.740
OKAY, YOU
SLAPPING MY HAND

16:32.908 --> 16:33.908
WHEN I TRIED
TO TAKE YOUR JERKY

16:34.076 --> 16:36.327
IS SOMETHING
A FAT GIRL WOULD DO.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.746
OH!

16:42.042 --> 16:44.877
OKAY, LAURIE? I KNOW
WHAT YOU TOLD HYDE.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.754
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, LOSER?

16:46.922 --> 16:49.257
THE CAMP STORY, DR. PEE PEE.
YOU'RE DEAD.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.384
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.678
SHH, PRETEND
IT'S TV.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.263
OKAY.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.472
WELL, I KNOW SOME PRETTY
HORRIBLE THINGS

16:56.640 --> 16:58.224
ABOUT YOU, TOO,
LITTLE LADY.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.642
FELLAS...

16:59.810 --> 17:02.854
LAURIE HERE WAXES HER LIPS,
LEGS, EYEBROWS,

17:03.022 --> 17:06.149
TOES, AND
SHOULDER BLADES.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.860
IN THE FIFTH GRADE,

17:09.028 --> 17:10.820
ERIC SENT AWAY FOR
THE CHARLES ATLAS KIT

17:10.988 --> 17:13.906
'CAUSE A GIRL KICKED
SAND IN HIS FACE.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.869
YOU STUFFED IN HIGH SCHOOL.
SO DID YOU.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.373
LAST YEAR LAURIE USED ALL OF
HER BIRTHDAY MONEY

17:22.541 --> 17:25.168
TO BUY
A BACK MASSAGER.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.546
WHICH ISN'T FOOLING
ANYONE, BY THE WAY.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.300
WELL...

17:32.468 --> 17:34.093
THAT'S NOT AS BAD AS
WHEN I WALKED IN ON YOU

17:34.261 --> 17:37.221
IN BED WITH YOUR DOROTHY HAMILL
POSTER, AND YOU WERE ALL...

17:37.389 --> 17:39.724
LAURIE WAS BORN
WITH A TAIL!

17:39.892 --> 17:41.851
WHAT?
AHH!

17:42.019 --> 17:45.104
YEAH, LAURIE WAS
BORN WITH A TAIL!

17:46.273 --> 17:48.900
I HATE YOU!

18:01.747 --> 18:04.707
IT'S TRUE.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.965
OKAY, RED.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.551
I'M VERY SORRY
I PAWNED THAT NECKLACE.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.136
THAT'S OKAY.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.097
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,
AND IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

18:19.264 --> 18:23.142
LET'S JUST LET
BYGONES BE BYGONES.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.937
WHAT DO YOU SAY, PRETTY LADY?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.028
WHAT'D YOU DO?

18:34.196 --> 18:37.365
A FEW MONTHS AGO, I PAWNED THE
POCKETWATCH YOUR DAD GAVE ME.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.866
SO WE'RE EVEN.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.409
LET'S JUST GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.578
OH, RED, HOW COULD YOU?

18:42.746 --> 18:44.872
WELL, KITTY...

18:45.040 --> 18:47.834
WHO THE HELL NEEDS
A DAMN POCKETWATCH?

18:48.001 --> 18:49.377
WHAT TIME IS IT?

18:49.545 --> 18:52.004
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL CHECK MY POCKET.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.881
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
THAT'S JUST STUPID.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.299
OH, RED.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.469
AND I PAWNED THE LAWN MOWER
AND ERIC'S OLD PHONOGRAPH PLAYER

18:58.637 --> 19:01.305
AND... SNOW BLOWER.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.599
WE HAD A SNOW BLOWER?

19:03.767 --> 19:06.769
ACTUALLY, IT WAS BOB'S.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.565
WELL, WHY'D YOU GET
SO MAD AT ME?

19:10.732 --> 19:12.441
I GOT MAD AT MYSELF.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.194
LOOK, IT'S THE MAN'S JOB
TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.864
AND IF HE CAN'T DO THAT,
IT'S THE MAN'S JOB

19:18.031 --> 19:22.160
TO PAWN THE THINGS TO FEED THE
FAMILY THAT HE CAN'T SUPPORT!

19:24.621 --> 19:29.625
OKAY.

19:34.840 --> 19:41.179
YOU KNOW, BOB'S BEEN LOOKING
FOR THAT SNOW BLOWER.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.890
YEAH, I KNOW, KITTY.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.475
AND BELIEVE YOU ME...

19:46.643 --> 19:50.521
I'M RUNNING OUT OF STORIES.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.819
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
I SLEPT WITH THE DEVIL?

19:59.364 --> 20:02.074
EXACTLY.

20:02.242 --> 20:07.413
SHE TOLD ME
IT WAS A BIRTHMARK.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.290
IT IS A BIRTHMARK.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.585
FROM WHERE THEY CUT OFF
HER TAIL AT BIRTH.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.256
GUYS, I'M ACTUALLY STARTING TO
FEEL A LITTLE BAD ABOUT THIS.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.051
YEAH. IT IS NOT RIGHT TO REVEAL
OTHER PEOPLE'S SECRETS.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.387
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE
WITH DR. PEE PEE ON THIS ONE.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.893
HELLO, BOYS.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.811
AND HOW ARE YOU, MICHAEL?

20:30.979 --> 20:32.230
WELL, NOT SO GOOD.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.565
I JUST GOT SOME VERY
DISTURBING NEWS.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.735
WELL, I HOPE
YOU'RE VERY UNHAPPY.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.403
FEZ, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

20:39.571 --> 20:41.822
YES.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.118
OKAY, FEZ, I JUST WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR LAST NIGHT.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.412
I KNOW I WASN'T
MY SUPERCUTE SELF.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.915
AND I'M SORRY.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.334
BUT YOU'RE A REALLY
GOOD FRIEND.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.461
BUT, JACKIE, I WAS HOPING
PERHAPS WE COULD BE

20:55.629 --> 20:57.797
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.425
WELL, HOPE SPRINGS
ETERNAL, FEZ.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.553
HOW ABOUT IF YOU JUST KEEP
WORSHIPPING ME FROM AFAR...

21:04.721 --> 21:06.889
AND STAY AVAILABLE.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.725
JUST IN CASE.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.853
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.816
THAT'S A SWEET DEAL.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.734
SHOULD WE KISS ON IT?

21:18.902 --> 21:21.070
SURE.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.865
BYE.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.451
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE DEAD!

21:28.036 --> 21:30.621
HIYAAA!

21:49.224 --> 21:52.893
SWEET DREAMS, DR. PEE PEE.

22:01.945 --> 22:05.114
OH, YEAH.
