WEBVTT

00:54.972 --> 00:57.014
What, for crying out loud?

00:57.015 --> 00:59.225
Sorry I'm late, everyone!

01:04.230 --> 01:07.233
Gohan, what's the deal with that outfit?

01:07.234 --> 01:10.069
Mother said I should be
neat and tidy when I come.

01:10.070 --> 01:15.032
We're just camping here!
What was your mommy thinking?

01:15.033 --> 01:19.245
And that rucksack is incredible.
What do you have inside it?

01:19.955 --> 01:24.417
Right! Mother packed
all kinds of things for me.

01:24.418 --> 01:29.839
Language, arithmetic, science
and social studies reference books,

01:29.840 --> 01:32.049
along with my sleep-study set.

01:32.050 --> 01:37.722
I also have mosquito repellent,
a bellywarmer and a pillow.

01:37.723 --> 01:42.810
My alarm clock...
this is a pouch of curry...

01:42.811 --> 01:45.271
and I have all of
this canned food...

01:45.272 --> 01:51.277
Let's see, I also have...
this, and that, and such...

02:59.596 --> 03:01.264
Fire!

03:18.824 --> 03:21.075
Hurry! We have to get upwind of it!

03:21.076 --> 03:23.953
W- which way is upwind!?
W- w- which way!?

03:25.330 --> 03:28.165
Gohan! We'll knock
the flames out using our Ki!

03:28.166 --> 03:30.126
Can you do that!?

03:30.127 --> 03:31.544
Yes!

03:31.920 --> 03:33.129
All right!

04:33.023 --> 04:35.107
Now's your chance!

04:57.965 --> 05:01.968
For a minute, I wasn't sure
what would become of us.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.135
Thank goodness.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.890
The animals have been put out.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.941
Poor guys.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.985
G- Gohan...

05:21.905 --> 05:24.907
Bulma-san, would you
lend us your Dragon Radar?

05:25.951 --> 05:27.785
The Dragon Radar?

05:30.122 --> 05:31.998
Oh, yeah!

05:34.960 --> 05:37.003
You're such good boys.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.214
Kuririn-san!

05:52.978 --> 05:57.982
Break through the shining clouds,
and fly away (fly away)

05:57.983 --> 06:05.156
As a panorama spreads itself
throughout my being!

06:05.157 --> 06:10.911
The earth, having been kicked
in the face, gets angry (angry)!

06:10.912 --> 06:17.585
And makes one of its
volcanoes explode!

06:17.586 --> 06:24.008
If, within the thawed polar ice,

06:24.009 --> 06:32.975
There is a dinosaur, then I want
to train him to balance atop a ball.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.228
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

06:36.229 --> 06:45.571
No matter what may happen,
I feel as though nothing can bother me,

06:45.572 --> 06:49.033
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

06:49.034 --> 06:54.997
However hard your chest pounds,
the Genki Dama will roar!

06:54.998 --> 06:58.167
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

06:58.168 --> 07:07.176
The emptier your head is,
the more room there is to pack with dreams,

07:07.177 --> 07:11.013
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

07:11.014 --> 07:18.020
With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,
today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...

07:18.021 --> 07:19.855
Sparking!

08:08.029 --> 08:09.947
Haiya Dragon!

08:09.948 --> 08:11.198
Come back!

08:21.042 --> 08:25.963
Don't do that! Shen Long is going
to return your forest back to normal!

08:25.964 --> 08:27.047
Right?

08:30.218 --> 08:33.095
Shen Long does have a scary face, and all.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.056
It's no wonder Haiya Dragon was frightened.

08:38.977 --> 08:45.024
Now, speak forth thy wish.
I shall grant thee any one wish.

08:45.025 --> 08:49.028
Please make this forest
the pretty forest it was before!

08:49.029 --> 08:52.072
That is a simple matter.

09:26.650 --> 09:30.069
I have granted thy wish.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.989
Farewell!

10:06.231 --> 10:08.232
That tickles!

11:17.052 --> 11:21.013
Tullece-sama, there are
life signs coming from Earth.

11:21.014 --> 11:26.935
There couldn't be. Earth is the
planet that Kakarrot was sent to...

11:26.936 --> 11:28.187
...long ago.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.108
Then again, it is too beautiful.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.114
Tullece-sama, you will be most pleased.

11:39.115 --> 11:43.786
Earth's soil appears to be
suitable for growing the Shinseiju tree.

11:49.376 --> 11:53.879
Goku-sa, how's the water?

11:53.880 --> 11:56.048
Not quite warm enough, Chichi.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.008
Father, let's have a contest.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.009
All right!

12:19.072 --> 12:21.073
G- Goku-sa!

12:28.081 --> 12:29.164
I lost.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.128
Haiya Dragon!

12:34.129 --> 12:35.754
G- Gohan-chan!

12:35.755 --> 12:39.091
See? This is the friend
I was telling you about earlier.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.093
I'm impressed
that you found my home.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.057
Isn't he cute?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.058
W- which part?

12:49.060 --> 12:50.894
Gohan-chan!

12:50.895 --> 12:55.065
Really, Gohan-chan,
you are fast becomin' a bad child!

12:55.066 --> 12:57.234
Ever since you started
playin' with Goku-sa 's friends,

12:57.235 --> 12:59.736
you don't study in the least!

12:59.737 --> 13:02.072
Chichi, ain't that enough already?

13:02.073 --> 13:04.074
Goku-sa, you just hush.

13:04.075 --> 13:09.079
Havin' come to this point,
I can't let him play anymore.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.165
But I do study.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.084
That's what makes you my Gohan-chan.

13:14.085 --> 13:17.171
So I can keep Haiya Dragon, can't I?

13:17.172 --> 13:20.090
Send it back to the mountains!

13:20.091 --> 13:23.177
I just can't deal with those things.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.178
But...

13:24.179 --> 13:28.015
You understand me?
Send it back, right now!

13:32.145 --> 13:35.939
I'm sorry, but you have to go
back to the mountains, okay?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.733
I'll come visit you later.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.154
Please, go bye-bye.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.156
No, I said.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.249
What am I going to do with you?

13:55.460 --> 13:57.085
Gohan!

14:15.188 --> 14:17.439
How do you like it, Gohan?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.690
Thank you, Father!

14:21.444 --> 14:23.612
But don't tell your mother!

14:37.210 --> 14:39.211
Well, Pu-erh, how's the ride?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.046
It's the best!

14:41.047 --> 14:44.258
Isn't it, isn't it? I bought it
on a 15-year loan, after all.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.760
I'm surprised someone
offered you that much credit.

14:49.097 --> 14:53.767
Well, I did become famous overnight
because of the Tenkaichi Tournament.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.353
Everyone will be so
surprised when we show up in this!

14:56.354 --> 14:57.521
They sure will!

15:01.192 --> 15:02.734
Yamucha-sama...

15:02.735 --> 15:04.361
What is that Ki!?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.575
For a little while now,
I've been sensing an ominous Ki...

15:55.163 --> 15:57.039
Take firm root, now.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.172
Hurry and bear fruit.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.523
Does that feel good?

16:41.167 --> 16:44.795
Gohan! Suppertime!

16:46.172 --> 16:47.673
Okay!

16:47.674 --> 16:50.300
We'll play again later, okay?

16:50.927 --> 16:52.594
Bye!

17:48.484 --> 17:53.864
To think that Earth would be an
ideal planet to grow Shinseiju fruit on...

17:53.865 --> 17:59.870
This is all thanks to Kakarrot
leaving the planet unharmed.

19:18.908 --> 19:19.991
Help!

19:59.365 --> 20:02.450
Wow, you had a rough time of it, huh?

20:02.451 --> 20:05.662
Yeah. My whole 15-year loan, all gone.

20:08.249 --> 20:12.252
Thank you. Sorry to suddenly drop in like this.

20:12.253 --> 20:15.005
Why did you buy something so expensive!?

20:15.006 --> 20:17.173
You're trying to be popular
with other girls again, huh!?

20:17.174 --> 20:19.009
N- no, i- it's not like that...

20:19.010 --> 20:23.179
You never think ahead, and just buy things!

20:26.934 --> 20:30.186
Chichi-san, thanks for
going to all this trouble for us.

20:30.187 --> 20:34.858
Don't be silly. As long as you
don't interfere with Gohan's studyin',

20:34.859 --> 20:37.027
you stay as long as you like.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.946
I could help teach him his lessons, okay?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.242
That's what I'm most worried about.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.962
H- Haiya Dragon!

20:58.132 --> 21:02.135
Gohan-chan! Haven't you
sent that thing back yet?

21:02.136 --> 21:04.137
W- well, you see...

21:06.724 --> 21:09.351
W- where's the harm?

21:09.352 --> 21:13.396
Goku-sa, you're conspirin'
with Gohan-chan again!

21:13.397 --> 21:15.231
I- I wouldn't say that...

21:17.109 --> 21:19.945
We can't do this
outside the cave, you know!

21:23.950 --> 21:26.201
--What's the matter?
--Gohan-chan!

21:26.202 --> 21:29.037
We've got guests! Send it away at once!

21:29.038 --> 21:30.038
Okay!

21:30.456 --> 21:33.083
Sorry about this, but wait
for me at the cave, okay?

21:34.919 --> 21:38.338
No, I can't play right now.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.676
No!

21:48.891 --> 21:51.101
He seemed to be acting strange, huh?

21:51.102 --> 21:52.727
It just wants to play.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.688
Goku...

21:55.231 --> 21:56.773
Kaio-sama?

21:56.774 --> 22:00.568
Goku, something terrible has happened.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.695
Something terrible?

22:01.696 --> 22:07.575
A ghastly tree called a Shinseiju
has taken root across the whole Earth.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.868
Shinseiju?

22:08.869 --> 22:14.624
Ordinarily, only Kami-sama are
allowed to eat of the fruit of this tree.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.793
Once a Shinseiju takes root,

22:16.794 --> 22:21.589
it bears fruit until it has sucked
all of the nourishment out of the land,

22:21.590 --> 22:23.883
while the surrounding plants wither away.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.886
The planet becomes a desert wasteland,

22:26.887 --> 22:29.639
and it's said that
not even a blade of grass

22:29.640 --> 22:32.642
will grow in its soil
for several centuries afterward.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.811
How can that be?

22:34.812 --> 22:39.566
In other words, once it has
taken root it is already too late.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.819
Its fruit will suck all of
the nutrients out of the Earth,

22:42.820 --> 22:46.656
and in the end, it will
turn the world into a desert.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.121
Then, our Earth is-!?

22:54.665 --> 22:58.668
Unfortunately, it's too late.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.920
I can't believe that!

23:06.594 --> 23:09.471
A little longer, and the fruit will be ripe.

23:09.472 --> 23:12.640
After eating the fruit which has
absorbed this much of the Earth's energy,

23:12.641 --> 23:16.102
our power will rise once again.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.813
The Crusher Tullece Corps,
strongest in the universe,

23:18.814 --> 23:22.609
will be invincible wherever we go!

23:22.610 --> 23:24.736
Even Freeza will be easy to handle.

23:24.737 --> 23:29.032
Tullece-sama will be
the emperor of the universe!

23:29.033 --> 23:30.742
Da!

23:31.827 --> 23:35.830
And it's all thanks to the Shinseiju fruit.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.956
No.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.629
It's thanks to that foolish Kakarrot.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.676
The trees are all going to wither and die!?

23:48.677 --> 23:50.678
And all the water will be gone?

23:52.014 --> 23:53.932
I don't know.

23:55.559 --> 23:59.395
But once it takes root, it's too late, right?

24:00.523 --> 24:02.857
If we put all of our powers together,

24:02.858 --> 24:05.860
we should be able to blow
the tree away, roots and all!

24:05.861 --> 24:09.697
That's right! Let's do it, guys!

24:09.698 --> 24:10.698
--Yeah!
--All right!

24:11.867 --> 24:13.701
Let's go!

24:15.871 --> 24:18.873
Gohan, you can't go.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.545
Aww...

24:33.222 --> 24:36.683
And after Shen Long went to the trouble
of returning this forest back to normal.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.686
Who the hell would do this?

24:39.687 --> 24:41.771
All right, here goes!

25:13.596 --> 25:15.221
Goku, let's try again!

25:15.222 --> 25:17.891
It's no use! It doesn't look like
we can get rid of these roots

25:17.892 --> 25:19.934
without blowing the Earth to bits!

25:42.708 --> 25:47.879
Nobody can destroy the Shinseiju tree.

25:47.880 --> 25:53.718
I can sense an incredible Ki
from them. Who are these guys?

25:53.719 --> 25:57.680
You're the ones who
planted this tree, ain't you?

25:57.681 --> 26:03.728
Anyone who gets in our
way will lose their lives.

26:03.729 --> 26:07.732
You guys caused that explosion, huh?

26:07.733 --> 26:10.818
Give me back my new car, you bastards!

26:10.819 --> 26:12.570
Da!

26:12.571 --> 26:17.909
These guys don't look like Saiyans,
but I've got a bad feeling about this.

26:19.828 --> 26:23.748
I wonder if he doesn't like me anymore.

26:30.673 --> 26:34.759
Maybe he went back to the
forest because I got so mad at him.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.557
Haiya Dragon!

26:56.824 --> 26:58.825
I'll get you back for my loan!

27:12.798 --> 27:13.756
Chaozu!

27:23.767 --> 27:25.685
Raisin!

27:25.686 --> 27:26.686
Rakasei!

27:26.687 --> 27:29.689
We are twin brothers!

27:29.690 --> 27:31.774
Taiyo-ken!!

27:44.705 --> 27:46.622
Kienzan!!

27:58.802 --> 27:59.886
Take this!

27:59.887 --> 28:02.972
Hmph! If you want to win, you do this!

28:21.533 --> 28:22.700
D- damn!

28:27.706 --> 28:28.790
Sokidan!!

28:56.735 --> 28:57.777
Yamucha!

29:00.781 --> 29:03.825
You'll have to take me on!

29:16.255 --> 29:18.756
Pull a clever stunt like that, will you!?

29:26.765 --> 29:28.558
W- who's there!?

29:28.559 --> 29:31.727
Stop messing up the animals' forest!

29:31.728 --> 29:34.814
Tch, this isn't my lucky day.
I'm facing another kid.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.820
He's strong.

29:40.821 --> 29:44.574
That kid couldn't be...

29:47.744 --> 29:49.579
...a Saiyan?

29:49.580 --> 29:53.040
This time, I'm not holding back!
Brace yourself!

29:55.752 --> 29:57.837
Masenko!!

30:07.806 --> 30:10.725
W- what the hell just happened?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.769
Where did that kid go!?

30:13.770 --> 30:15.771
Right here!

30:15.772 --> 30:16.689
What!?

30:21.778 --> 30:22.862
I did it!

30:25.699 --> 30:28.576
This kid is the genuine article.

30:32.623 --> 30:37.627
That's strange. Where could
Haiya Dragon have gone?

30:37.628 --> 30:40.713
Could he be hiding somewhere?

30:40.714 --> 30:42.798
I hope he's safe-

30:48.597 --> 30:50.598
Father?

30:50.599 --> 30:54.685
Oh, I see, so you're Kakarrot's son.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.439
You're not Father!

31:02.778 --> 31:06.781
It's not surprising that
Kakarrot and I should look alike.

31:06.782 --> 31:10.868
We disposable lower-class
warriors only come in a few types.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.792
Battle power 10,000.

31:17.793 --> 31:21.629
I should have figured as much,
inheriting Saiyan blood like you do.

31:22.798 --> 31:23.881
W- who are you!?

31:23.882 --> 31:27.635
Me? I am...

31:27.636 --> 31:29.845
A- a Saiyan!

31:29.846 --> 31:32.765
Yes. My name is Tullece.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.768
T- Tullece?

31:35.769 --> 31:39.772
Listen, boy, would you
like to come with me?

31:39.773 --> 31:41.857
We'll roam through space
wherever we want to go,

31:41.858 --> 31:43.859
destroying any planets we like,

31:43.860 --> 31:46.862
eating delicious foods
and drinking delicious wines.

31:46.863 --> 31:49.699
There is no more
enjoyable life than this.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.539
Who do you think is going to join you!?

31:58.625 --> 32:02.878
Hey, now, don't be so harsh.

32:02.879 --> 32:07.883
We're among the
few surviving Saiyans.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.885
Let's get along, now.

32:15.559 --> 32:22.648
This beautiful blue planet is already doomed
to become a rust-colored, dried-up world.

32:22.649 --> 32:28.904
You're better off coming with me.
Unless you'd rather die like this?

32:32.743 --> 32:36.746
Something's coming. Battle power 18,000.

32:36.747 --> 32:37.913
Who is it?

32:47.841 --> 32:49.675
What do you want?

32:49.676 --> 32:52.845
P- Piccolo-san!

32:52.846 --> 32:55.640
Take your hands off of Gohan.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.725
I must politely decline.

32:57.726 --> 32:58.893
Don't mess with me!

33:04.566 --> 33:06.734
--P- Piccolo-san!
--Are you okay?

33:06.735 --> 33:07.902
Yeah.

33:25.754 --> 33:29.340
As a Saiyan, you should live
in a way more befitting a Saiyan.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.929
Otherwise, that fine tail of yours will weep.

33:41.770 --> 33:45.898
Let me show you the correct way to use it.

33:45.899 --> 33:48.693
The way that will make you

33:48.694 --> 33:51.696
the most keenly aware
that you are a Saiyan!

34:03.333 --> 34:04.917
Do you know what this is?

34:04.918 --> 34:06.877
It's the moon.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.634
Burst open and blend together!

34:31.610 --> 34:35.531
Boy, show me your Saiyan power!

34:43.873 --> 34:45.541
Don't look, Gohan!

35:07.856 --> 35:10.775
Can't have me becoming an ape, too.

35:10.776 --> 35:15.613
But the effect of my power
ball will last a little longer.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.866
Now, show me your primary form.

35:23.705 --> 35:24.872
Leave my Gohan alone!

35:27.709 --> 35:29.585
Die!

35:45.811 --> 35:46.894
You guys...

35:48.563 --> 35:49.897
...are in my way!!

36:09.751 --> 36:10.835
G- Gohan!

36:13.046 --> 36:14.046
Gohan!

36:15.757 --> 36:16.757
Kaio-ken!!

36:32.566 --> 36:33.566
Gohan!

36:51.585 --> 36:54.753
The child kills his father.
Thus are the Saiyans.

36:54.754 --> 36:57.590
Kakarrot, after you're dead,

36:57.591 --> 37:00.593
I will look after your kid, so rest easy.

37:00.594 --> 37:02.595
Son! Cut off his tail!

37:07.559 --> 37:09.602
--Piccolo!
--Do not interfere!

37:09.603 --> 37:11.604
You don't know when to die!

37:35.795 --> 37:37.880
Gohan! Gohan!

38:04.074 --> 38:06.408
Smash him against
the rocks like an insect!

39:11.850 --> 39:13.642
Why does someone like you,

39:13.643 --> 39:16.895
who has inherited the blood
of the mightiest of warriors, the Saiyans,

39:16.896 --> 39:20.733
show pity to a lower
life form like that?

39:22.819 --> 39:27.156
Gohan and me ain't Saiyans!
We're Earthlings!

39:28.033 --> 39:30.034
Are you sure about that?

39:47.052 --> 39:48.052
Gohan!

39:51.848 --> 39:54.933
How about now? Can you
still say he's not a Saiyan?

40:06.196 --> 40:08.322
You fool! You think
you're a match for me!?

40:13.661 --> 40:16.747
Looks like I was
uncharacteristically optimistic

40:16.748 --> 40:19.750
about taking the traitor
Kakarrot's kid with me, after all.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.630
Die!!

40:25.632 --> 40:26.757
Gohan!

40:51.699 --> 40:53.826
F- Father...

40:55.703 --> 40:59.706
Father, protect the earth...

41:01.042 --> 41:02.084
Gohan!

41:04.129 --> 41:08.298
I don't know about the earth,
but I'll protect you, at least!

41:09.884 --> 41:14.638
And I am definitely
going to defeat that guy!

42:12.864 --> 42:16.241
Kakarrot, you're a
disgrace to the Saiyan race!

42:16.242 --> 42:20.120
I ain't Kakarrot! I'm Son Goku!

42:20.121 --> 42:24.166
Tullece-sama, please
allow us to deal with him.

42:30.215 --> 42:36.178
These guys seemed to fight pretty well,
but they're still no match for us.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.811
That was a close call earlier.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.022
You guys stand aside!

42:47.023 --> 42:49.191
Don't you look down your nose at us!

43:05.917 --> 43:08.919
You sure are in a fine position,
watching from a distance, huh!?

43:26.020 --> 43:27.854
That hurt a little bit.

43:35.029 --> 43:37.030
You guys are in my way!

43:56.050 --> 44:00.178
Kakarrot, if you kneel
before me and apologize,

44:00.179 --> 44:04.224
I will allow you and your kid to join me.

44:04.225 --> 44:07.102
I told you! I'm Son Goku!

44:07.103 --> 44:11.481
I've been repeatedly eating
the fruit of the Shinseiju.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.400
You think you can beat me?

44:15.445 --> 44:19.489
The difference in our powers
is like that of heaven and earth.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.326
You won't know that until you try me!

45:02.784 --> 45:07.704
I really am glad
that I hit my head as a baby!

45:07.705 --> 45:10.707
That's because I got away
with not being like you!

45:13.544 --> 45:17.547
I can't let you leave like this!

45:17.548 --> 45:19.800
B- battle power 30,000!

45:28.768 --> 45:32.604
What is with this guy?
His battle power is skyrocketing!

45:59.340 --> 46:00.674
I've won.

46:25.741 --> 46:29.828
You won't be able to face me
now with that kind of battle power.

46:29.829 --> 46:32.747
I'll dig a grave for you
right in the middle of this world,

46:32.748 --> 46:34.749
as it turns into a desert.

46:38.754 --> 46:43.675
It's the least I can do for you,
since we were both born Sayians.

46:50.558 --> 46:54.895
Is that all the power you've got!?
See if you can entertain me some more!

46:57.607 --> 47:01.610
Kaio-ken... times ten!!

47:20.838 --> 47:22.839
Now, kneel...

47:22.840 --> 47:26.801
If you kneel and beg for
your life, I will forgive you.

47:26.802 --> 47:32.766
I- I promised Gohan... I- I can't lose...

47:32.767 --> 47:34.601
What will it be, Kakarrot?

47:34.602 --> 47:37.771
I'm... Son Goku!

47:37.772 --> 47:39.606
In that case, die!

47:55.706 --> 47:59.793
You're just a lower-class
fighter after all. What a disgrace.

47:59.794 --> 48:01.878
But I'm not like you.

48:01.879 --> 48:05.882
Using the Shinseiju fruit, I will bring
the whole universe to its knees!

48:14.892 --> 48:19.854
G- Goku... a Genki Dama...

48:19.855 --> 48:23.775
H- hit him with a Genki Dama...

48:23.776 --> 48:27.529
Piccolo... Yamucha...

48:27.530 --> 48:31.866
I can't... I don't have the power left...

48:31.867 --> 48:37.872
G- Goku... don't forget, I'm here, too...

48:37.873 --> 48:40.375
Me, too...

48:40.376 --> 48:43.795
Kuririn... Chaozu...

48:43.796 --> 48:47.882
I'm still alive, too!

48:47.883 --> 48:50.844
Father...

48:50.845 --> 48:52.512
G- Gohan!

48:55.850 --> 48:57.851
A- all of you...

49:08.738 --> 49:10.905
You're still alive, are you?

49:14.744 --> 49:16.578
You are persistent.

49:20.750 --> 49:23.668
T- the Land...

49:23.669 --> 49:25.879
the Seas...

49:25.880 --> 49:27.589
the Skies...

49:30.885 --> 49:35.847
...and everyone drawing
breath on this world at this time...

49:35.848 --> 49:38.808
...share your Genki energy with me!

49:38.809 --> 49:42.562
For all of your sakes...
for the Earth's sake...

49:43.898 --> 49:47.651
...give me your Genki energy!

49:49.904 --> 49:51.655
Kakarrot?

50:06.921 --> 50:08.755
Out of my way!

50:42.540 --> 50:44.207
It's done!

50:49.922 --> 50:53.550
W- what?

50:53.551 --> 50:57.721
You are not getting away with this!
Tullece, take this!

51:23.038 --> 51:27.625
T- the earth's Genki energy
has been absorbed by the Shinseiju tree,

51:27.626 --> 51:30.712
so the Genki for
the Genki Dama wasn't enough.

51:30.713 --> 51:33.548
I- it's all over now...

51:41.348 --> 51:44.350
With all of these,
there is nothing for me to fear.

52:49.458 --> 52:53.461
So warm... W- what is this?

53:11.105 --> 53:13.106
S- Son...

53:14.483 --> 53:19.571
Goku is gathering Ki
from the Shinseiju...

53:46.015 --> 53:47.849
So warm...

53:55.524 --> 53:56.608
Tullece!

54:04.033 --> 54:06.701
Kakarrot, are you still around!?

54:06.702 --> 54:08.870
You are not getting away with this.

57:23.190 --> 57:25.191
Haiya Dragon!

57:26.527 --> 57:31.614
With the Shinseiju withering and dying,
the earth just might be spared.

57:33.033 --> 57:37.203
It's because the Shinseiju fruit
shared its energy with Son Goku,

57:37.204 --> 57:42.041
the same Shinseiju fruit
that had absorbed the earth's energy,

57:42.042 --> 57:45.962
that he was able to
create a super Genki Dama.

57:45.963 --> 57:53.010
And with that mass of nourishment
now raining down like a shower,

57:53.011 --> 57:58.015
it is giving its power to all living things.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.929
Son-kun, it really is a good
thing you bumped your head

58:36.930 --> 58:38.931
when you were a baby, huh?

58:38.932 --> 58:40.099
It sure is.

58:40.100 --> 58:43.019
Otherwise, you might
have ganged up with Tullece,

58:43.020 --> 58:45.980
and ravaged the universe with them.

58:47.191 --> 58:51.986
And as a result, I still have the scar here.

58:51.987 --> 58:55.198
Hey, Haiya Dragon,
I hear you played a big role.

58:55.199 --> 58:58.910
You've got a lot of guts, don't you?

59:01.079 --> 59:06.000
T- this guy is just like Piccolo!
He only lets his guard down for Gohan!

59:06.001 --> 59:08.085
That was close, that was close!

59:27.147 --> 59:29.232
Look, right behind us,
the gods of destruction!

59:29.233 --> 59:31.067
I am able to see them!

59:31.068 --> 59:34.987
Dragon! Dragon! (Dragon! Dragon!)

59:34.988 --> 59:36.989
Look, right next to us,
the gods of destruction!

59:36.990 --> 59:38.699
They stretch out their arms
and there's an explosion!

59:38.700 --> 59:42.078
Dragon! Dragon! (Dragon! Dragon!)

59:42.079 --> 59:49.252
They're coming after us,
cloaked in darkness,

59:49.253 --> 59:57.885
but right now, the energy we
have to face them is uncertain.

59:57.886 --> 01:00:02.890
You- all do a handstand
to lend your support,

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.225
just a little power.

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:12.149
I'll put it all together,
and send it along!

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:16.112
The whole world wants to be saved,

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:21.242
the whole world believes,

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:28.040
in all of their dreams.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.042
Look, right before our eyes,
the gods of destruction!

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.252
I am able to feel them!

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:35.172
Dragon! Dragon! (Dragon! Dragon!)

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.258
Look, right near us,
the gods of destruction!

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.093
I am able to see them!
