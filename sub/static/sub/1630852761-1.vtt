00:57.424 --> 01:00.160
<i>It's hard not to feel lucky.</i>

01:13.206 --> 01:16.476
<i>Though Dad says
there's no such thing.</i>

01:25.252 --> 01:29.356
<i>There's those who are prepared
for opportunities and setbacks,</i>

01:29.389 --> 01:31.559
<i>and those who are not.</i>

01:35.597 --> 01:36.864
<i>Luck doesn't exist.</i>

01:51.378 --> 01:53.347
<i>After the wars,
it was very obvious</i>

01:53.380 --> 01:55.750
<i>who was prepared
and who wasn't.</i>

02:00.755 --> 02:03.858
<i>Man had fallen far away
from his primitive roots.</i>

02:11.833 --> 02:14.869
<i>We forgot how to do
the most basic of things.</i>

02:16.938 --> 02:18.640
<i>Like getting food.</i>

02:20.508 --> 02:22.275
<i>I still don't know
what it means,</i>

02:22.309 --> 02:24.846
<i>but apparently everything
was wrapped in plastic</i>

02:24.879 --> 02:26.380
<i>and ready to go.</i>

02:29.249 --> 02:30.685
<i>Dad loves that saying.</i>

02:38.626 --> 02:41.562
<i>We don't disagree
on much of anything.</i>

02:55.610 --> 02:58.412
<i>I feel real lucky
to have the dad I do.</i>

03:04.886 --> 03:06.486
Jakey?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.335
How'd you go?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.906
Decent...
for end of season.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.974
Six cohos, a couple dogs.

03:27.008 --> 03:29.309
- It's in the smoker?
- Yeah.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.344
Cold chamber's
leaking pretty bad.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.515
I patched it up, but I think
it needs a proper redo.

03:36.017 --> 03:37.552
Put it on the list.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.386
Already did.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.991
The supper's on the stove
heating up.

03:44.025 --> 03:45.727
I'll be in shortly.

03:51.566 --> 03:54.468
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.369
Let me in! Let me in!

03:56.403 --> 03:58.639
Don't look at him.
Don't look at him! Come here!

03:58.673 --> 04:00.541
Jake!

04:00.575 --> 04:02.643
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.516
You okay, Jakey?

04:11.953 --> 04:13.420
The dream...

04:16.456 --> 04:18.793
You know the wars
are in the past.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.831
We gotta do something
to erase these memories.

04:23.865 --> 04:28.836
Focus on the future
and bury the past.

04:28.870 --> 04:30.037
Okay?

05:04.639 --> 05:06.607
Need a hand, old man?

05:06.641 --> 05:08.341
I'm good.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.510
You sure?

05:11.378 --> 05:13.581
I can have half a cord of wood
chopped before you get back.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.116
You're dreaming.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.851
Loser cooks and cleans.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.019
Deal!

05:31.132 --> 05:32.533
This ax is sharp. Well done.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.505
Get in the house.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.680
You stay here.
Anyone comes through that door,

05:45.713 --> 05:47.582
- shoot them in the face!
- Dad, I can help.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.416
I can take these SOBs out.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.954
You are gonna stay here
and protect what's ours.

05:52.987 --> 05:54.689
I'll sweep the perimeter.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.892
If I'm not back in 30 minutes,
you know what to do.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.972
Fuck this.

07:50.271 --> 07:51.772
You good?

07:53.040 --> 07:55.176
Yeah. Yeah.

07:55.209 --> 07:58.879
He got a couple of rounds off,
but he's a lousy shot.

08:03.718 --> 08:05.619
You're early.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.722
I heard the shots.
I just wanted to help.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.726
Your time will come
to bury plenty of men.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.162
It's just as important
for you to stay,

08:15.196 --> 08:16.731
keep our home safe.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.132
I'm ready now.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.934
I know.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.769
And I think
we're getting too comfortable.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.838
He was on his way to our cabin.

08:26.007 --> 08:29.176
When we're not prepared, we'll
be the ones getting buried.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.280
Now, you take care
of this SOB.

08:33.313 --> 08:37.551
I'm gonna go back to the cabin
and get cleaned up.

08:37.585 --> 08:38.953
Dad!

08:38.986 --> 08:41.655
- What?
- You're bleeding.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.990
Fuck.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.260
Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.032
You... You finish up here
and meet me back at the cabin.

08:54.001 --> 08:57.271
Go on! This is not a democracy.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.790
You piece of shit.

09:30.271 --> 09:31.772
Tell my daughter...

09:33.307 --> 09:35.176
I love her.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.733
How are you feeling?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.235
I told you to stop worrying.

10:02.303 --> 10:04.905
And stop asking.

10:04.939 --> 10:08.075
Not a big deal.
It's just a 9mm.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.914
Dad, you know
in <i>The Swiss Family Robinson,</i>

10:13.948 --> 10:15.983
the father prays
to the god for safety,

10:16.016 --> 10:17.985
and then they find the island.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.087
God didn't point them there?

10:21.422 --> 10:22.990
No, Jake.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.894
The point was to show
how desperate he was.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.131
Talking to the fictitious
in survival mode.

10:30.164 --> 10:33.434
And besides, it's just a story.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.870
A story about...

10:35.903 --> 10:38.105
finding utopia...

10:38.139 --> 10:41.075
away from humanity
and all its evils.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.848
Why are you drawing that?

10:49.350 --> 10:52.386
That man had it written
on his chest.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.021
And?

10:56.323 --> 10:58.993
The outsiders still believe
in the religion?

11:01.128 --> 11:04.198
I'm sure the poor and the
desperate still cling on to it.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.069
How can they go through the wars
and still believe?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.872
You gotta think, for the masses,

11:11.906 --> 11:13.841
it's all they got left, right?

11:15.876 --> 11:18.012
Hope for the hopeless,
that's all.

11:28.122 --> 11:31.225
Hey, Jakey, come here.
Don't be scared.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.961
This man can't hurt us anymore.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.863
What if more bad men come?

11:35.896 --> 11:37.498
Well, then we'll
have to be prepared.

11:37.532 --> 11:41.869
But you just can't be scared,
Jakey, otherwise they get you.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.304
They're just not like us.

11:43.337 --> 11:46.240
Just don't
look them in the eye...

11:46.273 --> 11:49.210
- and then you'll be fine.
- Why?

11:49.243 --> 11:51.445
'Cause if you look them
in the eye,

11:51.478 --> 11:56.150
they'll trick you into thinking
that they're still human.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.452
Don't you ever forget that.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.109
You okay?

13:30.411 --> 13:32.079
Yeah, I'm good.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.014
I told you to quit asking.

13:36.150 --> 13:38.852
How many traps you set today?

13:38.886 --> 13:40.254
Seven.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.190
Try and get a dozen
by the end of the day, okay?

14:03.043 --> 14:04.345
Dad?

14:09.684 --> 14:11.118
Dad!

14:14.355 --> 14:15.489
Dad!

14:18.425 --> 14:20.327
Come here, come here.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.368
What can I do?

14:27.401 --> 14:30.437
Boil some water
and get me some whiskey.

14:34.676 --> 14:37.378
Get some gauze
out of the first aid kit.

14:40.648 --> 14:42.349
It's all gone.

14:42.383 --> 14:44.485
Get the cleanest rags
you can find

14:44.519 --> 14:46.521
and put them
in the boiling water.

14:52.594 --> 14:55.028
We have everything we need.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.098
This is our home now...
and forever.

14:58.132 --> 15:00.300
What about Mom?

15:00.334 --> 15:02.269
Is she never coming back?

15:03.705 --> 15:05.205
Jakey...

15:07.474 --> 15:08.643
Mom's dead.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.646
She's not coming back.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.349
They killed her.

15:17.151 --> 15:18.452
Do you understand?

15:19.721 --> 15:21.155
I hate them.

15:22.590 --> 15:25.159
You don't fill your heart
with hate, son.

15:26.628 --> 15:28.429
We have each other.

15:28.462 --> 15:31.566
And I will protect you
until the day I die.

16:01.729 --> 16:03.163
How is it?

16:08.636 --> 16:10.170
Jakey...

16:11.706 --> 16:14.007
you listen carefully.

16:20.214 --> 16:22.349
The antibiotics are too old.

16:23.618 --> 16:24.752
Here, take these keys.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.490
Go to the caches.

16:32.426 --> 16:35.496
Jakey, if I'm too weak...

16:37.164 --> 16:39.233
and the outsiders come...

16:40.835 --> 16:43.671
you gotta shoot to kill.

16:43.705 --> 16:48.041
If anybody steps a foot on
our land, I'll kill them dead.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.612
Go to the cache
by the big spruce...

16:53.180 --> 16:55.382
and get the SHTF book.

17:12.599 --> 17:18.673
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

18:00.648 --> 18:01.783
Are you ready for this?

18:03.417 --> 18:06.186
Yeah.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.856
You need to know you're ready.

18:10.792 --> 18:12.894
You gotta feel it
in your bones.

18:12.927 --> 18:14.394
I know, Dad.

18:15.763 --> 18:19.266
You're a better shot
than your old man.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.736
You need to be ready...

18:21.769 --> 18:23.504
to bury anybody
you come across.

18:23.538 --> 18:25.840
Are you ready for that?

18:25.873 --> 18:28.408
Dad, I'm ready. I can do this.

18:28.442 --> 18:31.378
Then you tell me
you will put a bullet

18:31.411 --> 18:33.380
between the eyes
of any person you see.

18:33.413 --> 18:37.217
- Any man that I see.
- Man, woman or child.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.886
They'll all kill you
just the same.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.389
Do not underestimate them,
or you won't make it back alive.

18:43.925 --> 18:46.460
Don't let them
make the first move.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.430
Dad, I got this.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.701
You're gonna be okay.
I promise.

18:59.641 --> 19:00.808
Go.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.344
<i>This is really
important, Jakey.</i>

19:37.377 --> 19:39.514
<i>This is
our first line of defense.</i>

19:40.882 --> 19:43.283
<i>The outside world is full</i>

19:43.316 --> 19:46.386
<i>of filthy
and desperate people</i>

19:46.420 --> 19:50.290
<i>who will shoot us
dead on sight.</i>

19:50.323 --> 19:53.393
There are gangs of marauders

19:53.427 --> 19:56.329
roaming around
in gas-powered vehicles,

19:56.363 --> 19:58.331
ready to take anyone away.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.734
Even kids?

19:59.767 --> 20:01.301
Especially kids.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.403
There are cities and major towns

20:03.437 --> 20:05.372
that have been burnt
to the ground

20:05.405 --> 20:07.742
and women and children
burned alive.

20:07.775 --> 20:11.813
- Why?
- Because people are desperate

20:11.846 --> 20:13.781
and ill-prepared.

20:13.815 --> 20:17.552
They will burn our house down
with us in it

20:17.585 --> 20:20.555
just for a gun
or a piece of food.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.826
That's why I brought us
all the way up here.

20:24.859 --> 20:27.461
<i>We're gonna be safe here
for a long time.</i>

21:09.436 --> 21:10.805
Mmm.

24:20.227 --> 24:21.829
Hey!

24:37.044 --> 24:39.213
I got the antibiotics
and steroids.

24:39.246 --> 24:40.781
Jakey?

24:43.017 --> 24:45.186
Here.

24:45.219 --> 24:46.587
Hey.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.289
Anyone see you?

24:48.322 --> 24:50.257
No. Nobody saw me.

24:55.563 --> 24:57.131
Did you see outsiders?

24:59.700 --> 25:00.968
Yeah.

25:02.970 --> 25:04.105
And?

25:06.607 --> 25:08.009
I killed 'em dead.

25:11.078 --> 25:12.613
How many?

25:12.646 --> 25:13.848
Where?

25:16.283 --> 25:17.651
Just a lady.

25:17.685 --> 25:19.587
At the medicine place.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.322
No men?

25:21.355 --> 25:22.923
No others?

25:22.957 --> 25:24.592
There were fresh tracks
and food.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.727
If they were there, they
were probably out hunting. Here.

25:26.761 --> 25:27.995
I scoped the area for a day

25:28.029 --> 25:29.830
before sniping the women
and breaching.

25:34.969 --> 25:37.071
You're sure
you weren't followed?

25:39.040 --> 25:43.077
Yeah. I doubled back twice
before the snowfall. I'm sure.

25:52.253 --> 25:55.756
It'll be too dangerous
to go back there for a while.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.762
You see any supplies?

26:03.898 --> 26:06.600
No. I didn't see any real value.

26:06.634 --> 26:09.670
Their perimeter and defenses
were nonexistent.

26:09.703 --> 26:11.338
I don't even think
they had guns.

26:12.873 --> 26:14.775
Everyone has guns.

26:18.746 --> 26:20.081
Hey, Jakey.

26:24.718 --> 26:26.821
You did real good.

28:01.782 --> 28:03.217
But it's impossible.

28:03.250 --> 28:07.254
There should be
half a rack of jerky left.

28:07.288 --> 28:09.456
Just the salmon stuff
we made the other day.

28:09.490 --> 28:11.258
I just checked.

28:11.292 --> 28:14.228
But I know there was
half a rack of jerky in there.

28:16.397 --> 28:18.265
Maybe the wolves got in.

28:18.299 --> 28:21.268
- I told you to patch that up.
- I did.

28:21.302 --> 28:23.437
Maybe they outsmarted us again.

28:23.470 --> 28:25.272
Fuck.

28:25.306 --> 28:28.209
We're gonna need to get
some red meat before winter.

28:29.977 --> 28:31.212
I'll go.

28:32.413 --> 28:33.914
Dad, I can handle it.

28:33.948 --> 28:36.283
I got the antibiotics,
didn't I?

28:36.317 --> 28:39.787
I just don't want us making
any more unnecessary risks

28:39.820 --> 28:41.989
- with me being hurt and all.
- Dad,

28:42.022 --> 28:43.357
I got it.

28:45.059 --> 28:47.061
I'll patch the cellar up
before I head out.

28:48.929 --> 28:50.197
You're right.

28:52.099 --> 28:54.468
Sometimes I forget
you've grown into a man.

28:56.904 --> 28:59.273
Don't you go near
that farm, though.

29:01.242 --> 29:04.178
They'll be looking for
the people that wronged 'em.

29:04.211 --> 29:07.448
I won't. I'll head out north.

30:03.070 --> 30:04.572
Are there others here?

30:07.107 --> 30:09.143
What are you
doing in my house?

30:11.278 --> 30:13.314
Are there others here?

30:15.916 --> 30:19.621
- Please don't kill me.
- I said, are there others here?

30:19.654 --> 30:21.221
No.

30:21.255 --> 30:23.123
You're not lying, are you?

30:25.459 --> 30:26.594
No.

30:37.004 --> 30:39.507
Did you tell others about me?

30:39.541 --> 30:41.241
Did you follow me?

30:45.946 --> 30:47.481
What are you doing here?

30:51.619 --> 30:53.053
I don't know.

30:59.661 --> 31:01.495
Then why don't you just leave?

31:02.697 --> 31:05.567
I'm not afraid to kill you.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.401
What do you want?

31:16.176 --> 31:17.612
I came to meet you.

31:23.951 --> 31:25.587
Do you have a name?

31:30.124 --> 31:31.358
Jake.

31:33.494 --> 31:35.262
I'm Henrietta.

31:38.733 --> 31:41.435
Do you want
to get those clothes dry?

31:43.103 --> 31:45.172
Maybe take a hot shower?

31:47.141 --> 31:49.577
I'll finish making some food,
and then maybe you can tell me

31:49.611 --> 31:54.415
why you're standing in my house
pointing a gun at me.

32:31.519 --> 32:33.120
No!

32:35.222 --> 32:37.191
Aah! It's too hot!

32:37.224 --> 32:38.693
Fix it or I'll break it.

32:44.599 --> 32:47.501
Did you turn the handle
on the right?

34:40.213 --> 34:42.516
What did you do with my gun?

34:42.550 --> 34:45.319
- I hid it.
- Why'd you do that?

34:45.351 --> 34:48.487
Please just leave,
for God's sakes.

34:48.523 --> 34:51.324
I could kill you
just as easily with this.

34:53.193 --> 34:55.697
If you're gonna do it,
just do it already.

35:02.269 --> 35:03.638
Are you done?

35:05.372 --> 35:07.709
Don't touch my gun again.

35:09.711 --> 35:12.513
I'll give it to you
when you leave.

35:12.547 --> 35:15.817
- Now the knife. Hand it over.
- How can I trust you?

35:15.850 --> 35:20.354
I'm trusting you
by letting you be in my home.

35:20.387 --> 35:23.256
Now show me the same respect.

35:36.938 --> 35:38.840
You're not a killer, are you?

35:39.974 --> 35:41.909
I can be if I need to be.

35:44.311 --> 35:45.647
Okay.

35:54.522 --> 35:55.657
Mmm.

35:57.457 --> 35:59.694
A man without a gun is nothing.

36:01.729 --> 36:05.298
Well, I don't like them
in my house,

36:05.332 --> 36:07.568
especially ones
pointed at my face.

36:08.936 --> 36:11.371
I'll give it back to you
when you leave.

36:14.408 --> 36:16.711
- Is that plastic?
- Yeah.

36:16.744 --> 36:18.311
Glad wrap.

36:18.345 --> 36:19.814
Is it ready to go?

36:24.351 --> 36:25.485
Uh...

36:26.921 --> 36:28.856
ready to go in the fridge.

36:30.490 --> 36:33.995
See?

36:34.028 --> 36:37.464
Was that you
snooping around here last week?

36:39.466 --> 36:40.902
Do you wanna share why?

36:42.737 --> 36:44.404
Medicine.

36:44.438 --> 36:45.973
Well, what for?

36:47.775 --> 36:49.677
My dad got
a pretty bad infection,

36:49.711 --> 36:51.411
and we were low on preps.

36:52.547 --> 36:56.718
Well, why didn't you just ask?

36:58.686 --> 37:01.455
Because I wasn't sure
if you were dangerous.

37:02.857 --> 37:05.593
Then how do you know
that I'm not?

37:12.934 --> 37:15.570
How do you survive here
without a gun?

37:16.871 --> 37:18.706
Pretty well, actually.

37:18.740 --> 37:21.042
And what do you do
when outsiders come to attack?

37:21.075 --> 37:23.945
Well, you're the first person
in my entire life

37:23.978 --> 37:26.948
that has ever
pointed a gun at me.

37:34.421 --> 37:36.389
I've never had soup like this.

37:36.423 --> 37:37.658
Mmm.

37:38.893 --> 37:40.061
Homegrown chilies.

37:40.094 --> 37:41.996
That's my secret ingredient.

37:43.965 --> 37:48.936
I think the cold, wet climate
up here makes them sweeter.

37:48.970 --> 37:53.074
Granted, you have to grow them
in a greenhouse.

37:53.107 --> 37:56.944
Kind of like tricking them
into feeling safe and warm.

37:58.112 --> 37:59.847
I think I can taste it.

38:01.448 --> 38:03.818
- Taste what?
- That you tricked them.

38:04.919 --> 38:07.088
Into feeling safe and warm.

38:07.121 --> 38:08.623
It's amazing.

38:10.457 --> 38:13.528
So it's just you and your dad?

38:13.561 --> 38:16.764
There's no family or visitors?

38:16.798 --> 38:19.567
No. No. No one like us.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.002
Just the outsiders.

38:23.137 --> 38:25.573
Tell me more
about how you live.

38:31.746 --> 38:33.581
I should really be going.

38:33.614 --> 38:36.483
Oh, wait, Jake,
you can stay the night.

38:36.517 --> 38:38.418
Just leave first thing
in the morning.

38:38.451 --> 38:39.987
You know, let your clothes dry.

38:40.021 --> 38:43.624
No, I have to get some venison.
I hid our jerky.

38:44.959 --> 38:46.627
What? Why?

38:46.661 --> 38:49.096
Dad doesn't want contact
with outsiders.

38:49.130 --> 38:51.966
So I had to get out
for a hunt without suspicion.

38:53.634 --> 38:57.672
Why doesn't your dad
want contact with outsiders?

38:57.705 --> 38:59.841
Because outsiders are dangerous.

39:06.747 --> 39:08.583
How's this look?

39:13.554 --> 39:14.856
It's frozen.

39:17.058 --> 39:18.793
It's ready to go.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.130
Well, it's yours if you want.

39:23.164 --> 39:26.499
Um, you can stay the night

39:26.534 --> 39:27.969
and wait out the storm

39:28.002 --> 39:30.771
and let your clothes dry
if you'd like.

39:52.459 --> 39:53.761
I gotta head out.

39:56.230 --> 39:57.765
Jake?

39:57.798 --> 40:00.067
Your gun is
in the kitchen cabinet.

40:01.602 --> 40:02.870
I found it.

40:06.507 --> 40:08.075
I hope your dad is okay.

40:12.647 --> 40:13.781
Thanks.

40:16.550 --> 40:18.085
I hope to see you again.

40:19.754 --> 40:22.957
Well, you know where to find me.

40:36.237 --> 40:37.805
What took you so long?

40:39.874 --> 40:41.709
It's how long it took.

40:41.742 --> 40:44.679
Three days to go to the banks
and bag a doe?

40:45.880 --> 40:47.181
No deer at the banks,

40:47.214 --> 40:49.717
so I had to hike to the meadows.

40:50.885 --> 40:52.186
That's where this is from?

40:53.888 --> 40:55.022
Yeah.

40:58.259 --> 40:59.827
Where's the rest?

41:01.929 --> 41:05.566
I didn't get a clean shot.
Wolves got to the rest.

41:05.599 --> 41:07.668
This was all I could salvage.

41:24.552 --> 41:26.654
How'd you make that clean cut?

41:29.623 --> 41:30.925
I used a saw.

41:32.927 --> 41:34.895
I stole it from that farm.

42:11.799 --> 42:13.567
Do you wanna press charges?

42:13.601 --> 42:14.969
No. I don't wanna press charges.

42:15.002 --> 42:16.804
I wanna know who he is.

42:18.105 --> 42:19.774
Did you ask him?

42:22.043 --> 42:26.680
Okay, uh, what I mean is,
I want to know if he's okay.

42:26.714 --> 42:30.117
- You said he's a grown man.
- Yes.

42:30.151 --> 42:33.087
To be frank, this department
doesn't have the manpower

42:33.120 --> 42:37.324
to comb through the forest
because of some bad vibes.

42:37.358 --> 42:39.026
In a 10-mile radius,

42:39.060 --> 42:42.963
we have 72 drilling rigs
operated by miscreants

42:42.997 --> 42:45.699
who couldn't work
at a gas station.

42:45.733 --> 42:47.134
That leaves the four of us

42:47.168 --> 42:50.671
to police
a mob of drunk, angry boys

42:50.704 --> 42:54.241
who are gonna be gone in a month
when the season's over.

42:54.275 --> 42:56.710
You know, I've got...

42:56.744 --> 42:59.346
assault, rape, murder.

42:59.380 --> 43:00.981
So it sounds like to me

43:01.015 --> 43:03.818
your mole person's
one of the good ones.

43:05.653 --> 43:07.354
- Jake.
- What?

43:07.388 --> 43:09.390
His name is Jake.

43:09.423 --> 43:12.026
His father's name is Troy.

43:14.728 --> 43:16.997
I'm giving you my number.

43:17.031 --> 43:19.200
I understand
that you're busy, and if...

43:19.233 --> 43:21.368
You know, just keep an ear out.

43:21.402 --> 43:23.938
Thank you
for the detailed account.

43:23.971 --> 43:26.874
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Here to serve.

44:14.922 --> 44:16.157
What's this?

44:18.726 --> 44:20.294
I added chilies to it.

44:22.763 --> 44:25.065
Those are to keep the animals
off the garden.

44:25.099 --> 44:26.834
- You know that, Jake.
- Yeah, I know,

44:26.867 --> 44:29.069
but it makes this taste amazing.

44:40.748 --> 44:41.916
Oh!

44:43.083 --> 44:44.919
What are you doing?

44:47.121 --> 44:49.089
I wanted to try something new.

44:51.526 --> 44:53.360
What has gotten into you, Jake?

44:54.862 --> 44:56.197
What is going on?

44:57.932 --> 44:59.500
The Swiss Family Robinson
used oyster shells

44:59.534 --> 45:02.136
to eat mussels
and ate lobsters with biscuits.

45:02.169 --> 45:05.272
They have fun trying new things
and making feasts. Why can't we?

45:05.306 --> 45:06.473
We eat to live.

45:07.875 --> 45:09.977
We don't live to eat, Jake.

45:10.010 --> 45:12.079
You're being ridiculous.

45:12.112 --> 45:14.782
Families in <i>National Geographic</i>
have tables full of food,

45:14.815 --> 45:16.150
big spreads, end to end.

45:20.955 --> 45:22.223
What did you say?

45:24.124 --> 45:26.528
It was just something
I saw once.

45:26.561 --> 45:28.062
Where?

45:30.331 --> 45:32.299
I've been reading
some new books.

45:34.034 --> 45:37.838
- What books?
- Just stuff I've found myself.

45:37.871 --> 45:39.406
Stuff that I've scavenged

45:39.440 --> 45:42.243
off the outsiders
you've shot over the years.

45:44.579 --> 45:46.046
Show me.

45:56.056 --> 45:57.358
I said, show me.

46:04.331 --> 46:09.103
This make you feel good,
keeping this stuff from me?

46:09.136 --> 46:11.905
- You keep stuff from me.
- No, I do not!

46:11.939 --> 46:13.407
I have never lied to you.

46:14.509 --> 46:15.876
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

46:15.909 --> 46:18.078
Well, you should be.

46:18.112 --> 46:20.180
How do you know
that lady deserved to die?

46:20.214 --> 46:22.316
She was an outsider.

46:22.349 --> 46:25.085
But how do you know
she deserved to die?

46:29.957 --> 46:33.327
Jake, I know
you must be feeling bad

46:33.360 --> 46:36.096
about killing that lady and all,

46:36.130 --> 46:38.165
but you gotta know
it's for the best.

46:38.198 --> 46:41.268
You did what you had to do.
Don't second-guess it.

46:41.302 --> 46:43.437
It's just wasting valuable time.

46:45.973 --> 46:48.175
I don't know
that I had to kill her.

46:48.208 --> 46:49.511
What makes you say that?

46:49.544 --> 46:51.478
I think
she was harmless to us.

46:51.513 --> 46:54.081
I think she could have
maybe helped us.

46:54.114 --> 46:57.051
<i>Jakey, you have to understand</i>

46:57.084 --> 46:59.286
<i>that just because
she was a woman,</i>

46:59.320 --> 47:01.255
<i>it doesn't change anything.</i>

47:01.288 --> 47:03.625
<i>Outsiders are outsiders.</i>

47:03.658 --> 47:07.061
<i>They're a plague
that'll ruin our world.</i>

47:07.094 --> 47:09.263
I think I could have
brought her back here,

47:09.296 --> 47:12.966
started a family,
like the Swiss Family Robinson.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.202
Are you serious?

47:15.235 --> 47:17.204
What if you die, Dad?

47:17.237 --> 47:19.507
I need to be able to finish
what you started here.

47:19.541 --> 47:22.209
Have a family,
like you and Mom had me.

47:24.311 --> 47:26.080
Well, maybe you're right.

47:27.515 --> 47:29.350
I wouldn't have anything
without you.

47:31.418 --> 47:35.089
Maybe we need to start preparing
you for a future without me.

47:37.257 --> 47:40.294
I'm not trying
to upset you, Dad.

47:40.327 --> 47:43.197
I'm just trying to prepare
like you've taught me.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.535
We can go look together,

47:47.569 --> 47:49.903
when I'm better.

47:49.937 --> 47:53.207
I mean, you're not gonna know
what you're looking at.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.543
I don't want you
getting your hopes up either.

47:57.244 --> 47:59.213
They're all lying whores.

48:41.756 --> 48:43.558
I found the missing jerky.

48:45.392 --> 48:48.195
Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?

48:48.228 --> 48:51.365
It was out past the creek.

48:51.398 --> 48:55.068
A raccoon must have
buried it for safekeeping.

48:55.102 --> 48:59.541
- Raccoons don't bury their food.
- No, they don't, do they?

49:03.010 --> 49:05.547
You wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

49:13.721 --> 49:15.222
You are gonna clean this

49:15.255 --> 49:17.391
until I know you're sorry
about lying to me.

49:17.424 --> 49:21.495
- Might be a while.
- What has gotten into you?

49:21.529 --> 49:23.363
Nothing.

49:23.397 --> 49:25.332
Absolutely nothing.

49:25.365 --> 49:28.101
Your whole attitude has changed.

49:28.135 --> 49:29.704
Are you sure
there's not something

49:29.737 --> 49:31.506
you want to admit to me?

49:33.207 --> 49:34.609
No, sir.

49:38.680 --> 49:40.682
Have you seen outsiders?

49:40.715 --> 49:43.016
- No.
- Jake.

49:43.050 --> 49:45.753
- Have you seen outsiders?
- No!

49:45.787 --> 49:48.388
None besides the one
you had me shoot dead!

49:49.757 --> 49:52.292
Are you 100 percent
sure she's dead?

49:52.326 --> 49:54.629
She's dead, Dad.

49:54.662 --> 49:56.230
Dead like Mom.

49:56.263 --> 49:57.665
What is happening to you?

49:57.699 --> 49:59.233
It's not
what's happening to me.

49:59.266 --> 50:01.068
It's what you said
it was out there.

50:01.101 --> 50:03.505
- What...? What about it?
- I've seen people and places,

50:03.538 --> 50:06.473
and it is not the chaos and
marauders that you've described.

50:06.508 --> 50:09.209
Jakey, you haven't seen shit.

50:09.243 --> 50:11.411
We're miles away
from the real shit.

50:11.445 --> 50:14.248
Why do you think I brought you
all the way up here?

50:14.281 --> 50:16.584
To keep you safe.

50:16.618 --> 50:18.452
Away from the chaos.

50:20.588 --> 50:24.258
You want to ruin everything
that I've built for us here?

50:27.662 --> 50:31.164
- I think you're wrong.
- Where the hell are you going?

50:31.198 --> 50:33.133
- To bring her back.
- Bring who back?

50:33.166 --> 50:35.168
I'm gonna show you, Dad.
She's okay.

50:35.202 --> 50:38.740
Wait. You're the one
who's in the wrong here, Jake!

50:40.340 --> 50:42.677
I just don't want you
to get hurt!

50:42.710 --> 50:44.812
Dad, if you are
ever going to trust me,

50:44.846 --> 50:46.514
then you need to let me go.

50:47.782 --> 50:49.416
I'm a grown man.

50:51.519 --> 50:53.420
Jakey?

51:55.415 --> 51:56.818
Freshwater mussels.

51:56.851 --> 51:59.654
You dove for those
without a wetsuit?

51:59.687 --> 52:00.922
Yeah.

52:00.955 --> 52:02.624
A place I call the Wall.

52:04.859 --> 52:06.594
Were you freezing?

52:06.628 --> 52:10.197
I was a little cold,
but I had a fire waiting.

52:10.230 --> 52:11.699
It's been snowing.

52:11.733 --> 52:14.501
How do you make a fire
in the snow?

52:21.709 --> 52:23.945
<i>Yellow cedar
shaving will light a fire</i>

52:23.978 --> 52:25.913
<i>even when it's raining hard.</i>

52:32.486 --> 52:34.421
<i>I've got a lighter
for emergencies,</i>

52:34.454 --> 52:36.423
<i>but I don't like to use it.</i>

52:38.258 --> 52:40.728
<i>Not when everything I need
can be scavenged.</i>

52:47.001 --> 52:48.703
We made fire!

52:57.011 --> 53:00.782
<i>Plus, the drill could
save your life.</i>

53:00.815 --> 53:02.583
<i>The drill?</i>

53:04.284 --> 53:05.687
<i>To set traps.</i>

53:07.320 --> 53:09.356
<i>Better to be prepared than not.</i>

53:09.389 --> 53:11.693
<i>I don't need any traps.</i>

53:14.294 --> 53:15.797
<i>Just in case.</i>

53:15.830 --> 53:17.832
<i>I like knowing
you're protected.</i>

53:24.539 --> 53:25.773
<i>Freshwater mussels.</i>

53:27.709 --> 53:30.678
<i>Dad says cooking them
over a fire is too much work...</i>

53:32.312 --> 53:33.581
<i>but I like it.</i>

54:01.475 --> 54:03.044
Yes.

54:03.077 --> 54:04.846
Yes.

54:04.879 --> 54:06.379
Oh!

54:06.413 --> 54:09.416
Tsk, you make it all
look so easy.

54:11.886 --> 54:13.621
What do you mean?

54:13.654 --> 54:15.923
Well, just...

54:15.957 --> 54:17.925
existing here.

54:17.959 --> 54:21.662
There's a balance,
a beauty to it.

54:21.696 --> 54:23.798
I've been at it
for some time now,

54:23.831 --> 54:27.568
and I think
that you would do better

54:27.602 --> 54:30.905
with your hands tied
behind your back.

54:30.938 --> 54:32.707
It's all I know.

54:32.740 --> 54:33.875
Hmm.

54:35.076 --> 54:36.911
What else do you wanna know?

54:38.946 --> 54:41.414
Stuff nobody can answer.

54:41.448 --> 54:44.384
Yeah? Like what?

54:44.417 --> 54:45.853
Like...

54:47.655 --> 54:49.657
where do we go when we die?

54:52.627 --> 54:54.061
What do you think?

54:56.130 --> 54:59.534
Well, Dad says we go
in the dirt and stay there.

54:59.567 --> 55:02.069
The Swiss Family Robinson
believe in Jesus.

55:04.105 --> 55:05.840
And what do you think?

55:07.775 --> 55:11.444
Well, I think we go in the dirt
and get eaten up by the plants.

55:11.478 --> 55:13.047
Like the big trees.

55:13.080 --> 55:15.850
And the yellow cedar
that I shaved today.

55:15.883 --> 55:18.719
Then we can go lots of places.

55:18.753 --> 55:21.823
We could grow into leaves
atop the forest one day

55:21.856 --> 55:24.826
to fall back down to the earth
and do it all over again.

55:26.426 --> 55:28.095
Or maybe a berry

55:28.129 --> 55:29.664
that a bird eats

55:29.697 --> 55:32.533
and takes us on ride
far away from here.

55:34.035 --> 55:35.937
A constant circle of life.

55:39.874 --> 55:42.577
Is that where you think
your mom is?

55:47.414 --> 55:49.416
She's the very top

55:49.449 --> 55:52.653
of the tallest golden spruce
in the entire forest.

55:54.088 --> 55:55.957
A tree so beautiful,
when you see it,

55:55.990 --> 55:58.559
it freezes you
right where you stand.

56:03.965 --> 56:05.633
Thank you, Jake.

56:09.203 --> 56:10.538
For what?

56:12.506 --> 56:14.075
Just for being you.

57:58.713 --> 58:01.215
I want you to come home with me.

58:01.248 --> 58:02.984
I think you'll love it.

58:07.054 --> 58:09.724
What would that
look like, Jake?

58:11.058 --> 58:13.127
Like an old oil painting.

58:15.329 --> 58:19.867
Like a family
living in harmony with nature.

58:21.769 --> 58:23.904
Giving back more than we take.

58:25.806 --> 58:28.242
Growing slowly
with the tallest trees.

58:29.877 --> 58:31.645
Like a heaven.

58:31.679 --> 58:34.048
But a real one.

58:34.081 --> 58:35.282
Right here.

58:43.691 --> 58:45.059
Jake...

58:45.092 --> 58:47.028
I'm old enough to know better,

58:47.061 --> 58:49.730
so I'm just gonna say this.

58:49.764 --> 58:51.932
What happened last night...

58:53.934 --> 58:55.970
was pretty amazing.

58:58.939 --> 59:01.142
But I don't wanna rush things.

59:02.910 --> 59:04.945
I don't think that's good
for either of us.

59:06.814 --> 59:09.150
You don't wanna be with me?

59:09.183 --> 59:11.185
No.

59:11.218 --> 59:13.120
I don't know. I mean...

59:13.154 --> 59:15.056
We just met.

59:15.089 --> 59:17.858
And I am not
in a position in my life

59:17.892 --> 59:20.861
to be making big decisions
like that.

59:23.064 --> 59:26.033
I have some stuff
I need to deal with today,

59:26.067 --> 59:29.870
and I don't think you should
stay here. I'm sorry.

59:29.904 --> 59:31.772
I can help you.

59:33.407 --> 59:34.942
It's personal.

59:36.811 --> 59:39.013
I'll see you soon though,
okay? I promise.

59:39.046 --> 59:40.915
- When?
- I don't know.

59:40.948 --> 59:42.917
Maybe in a few days.

59:56.664 --> 59:57.965
Do you know where they live?

59:57.998 --> 01:00:00.167
Jake, he just stops by
from time to time.

01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:03.003
Stops by?
Ma'am, are you in danger?

01:00:03.037 --> 01:00:04.805
What did you find out?

01:00:04.839 --> 01:00:08.175
Do any of these places or dates
mean anything to you?

01:00:10.211 --> 01:00:11.378
No.

01:00:11.412 --> 01:00:13.013
How old is Jake?

01:00:13.047 --> 01:00:16.383
- I'd say... 25?
- Hmm.

01:00:18.152 --> 01:00:21.822
On December 11th, 2002,
in Chicago,

01:00:21.856 --> 01:00:23.290
Troy Belstair kidnaps his son

01:00:23.324 --> 01:00:25.926
and attempts murder
on Miss Chandrey.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.295
House burns down
and arson is suspected.

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:30.998
- What are the chances?
- The only thing we have on him

01:00:31.031 --> 01:00:33.200
is his Illinois
state driver's license.

01:00:33.234 --> 01:00:35.369
Well, I've never seen
Jake's dad.

01:00:35.402 --> 01:00:37.238
Does it look like him?

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:42.676
I don't know.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.211
You sure?

01:01:18.112 --> 01:01:20.080
So this is home, huh?

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.888
Town?

01:01:27.922 --> 01:01:29.156
That's rich.

01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:32.359
Two plane rides to a ferry,

01:01:32.393 --> 01:01:35.362
then to another plane
that almost killed me...

01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:37.431
to a skiff.

01:01:37.464 --> 01:01:40.401
I think it's pretty safe to say
this is not a town.

01:01:41.536 --> 01:01:43.837
How are they?

01:01:43.871 --> 01:01:45.072
They're good.

01:01:45.105 --> 01:01:46.941
They're where they want to be,
home.

01:01:46.974 --> 01:01:49.076
Don't be an ass, Andy.

01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:52.012
I'm not. I'm just being real.

01:01:54.348 --> 01:01:55.482
Thank you.

01:01:58.986 --> 01:02:00.354
How you doing?

01:02:02.823 --> 01:02:04.425
Okay.

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:06.160
It's been pretty rough,

01:02:06.193 --> 01:02:09.330
but I think I'm starting to find
what I was looking for.

01:02:09.363 --> 01:02:11.065
Mm.

01:02:11.098 --> 01:02:15.102
And what exactly
was that again?

01:02:15.135 --> 01:02:17.104
Just to be clear.

01:02:18.439 --> 01:02:20.874
Balance.

01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:22.510
- In nature.
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:23.811 --> 01:02:26.380
That's it? Nature.

01:02:26.413 --> 01:02:28.882
You still don't get it,
like, even a little bit?

01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:30.784
No, I guess I don't.

01:02:33.187 --> 01:02:35.523
We met when we were so young.

01:02:35.557 --> 01:02:39.260
I don't think we even knew
who we were then.

01:02:39.293 --> 01:02:42.496
And I never wanted
to live in the city.

01:02:44.465 --> 01:02:47.201
Maybe I wasn't ready
for the responsibility of kids.

01:02:47.234 --> 01:02:51.238
But then we did, and your job,

01:02:51.272 --> 01:02:54.275
and it was like we were stuck.

01:02:54.308 --> 01:02:57.579
Every day
worse than the last.

01:02:57.612 --> 01:02:59.847
And the city and the people,

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.016
it was like it was
eating me alive.

01:03:02.049 --> 01:03:04.251
I honestly think

01:03:04.285 --> 01:03:07.321
it poisons the purity people
are supposed to have,

01:03:07.354 --> 01:03:11.292
in balance, where things matter
more than just money.

01:03:11.325 --> 01:03:12.459
Hmm.

01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:16.531
You know what I think?

01:03:16.564 --> 01:03:19.567
I think you're going through
an early midlife crisis

01:03:19.601 --> 01:03:22.136
and you don't know
what you need right now.

01:03:22.169 --> 01:03:24.138
You could've got another job.

01:03:24.171 --> 01:03:26.940
You could've gotten out
of the house once in a while.

01:03:26.974 --> 01:03:29.943
But instead you're what?

01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:31.546
You're here.

01:03:31.579 --> 01:03:35.349
It was like
I was just waiting to die.

01:03:35.382 --> 01:03:38.319
I tried to tell you
and the kids

01:03:38.352 --> 01:03:42.022
what I needed,
only to land on deaf ears.

01:03:42.056 --> 01:03:44.458
I was ignored.

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:46.193
And hated.

01:03:46.226 --> 01:03:49.330
Like... Like it was some kind
of unattainable reality.

01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:50.998
Look at you.

01:03:51.031 --> 01:03:53.434
You're up here
hiding from the real world.

01:03:53.467 --> 01:03:55.069
I'm not hiding.

01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:59.574
I can't go back to who I was.

01:05:03.437 --> 01:05:06.473
The kids like
living in the city, Hen,

01:05:06.508 --> 01:05:09.511
with their friends and school...

01:05:09.544 --> 01:05:12.146
Because they don't know
anything else.

01:05:20.053 --> 01:05:22.156
I think I should have
full custody of the kids.

01:05:22.189 --> 01:05:23.490
What?

01:05:23.525 --> 01:05:25.058
You chose to come up here

01:05:25.092 --> 01:05:27.161
without them, without us.

01:05:27.194 --> 01:05:31.131
Over and over,
I begged you and them

01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:33.033
to come with me.

01:05:33.066 --> 01:05:36.403
All it did was alienate me
from my own family.

01:05:36.437 --> 01:05:39.541
What was I supposed to do?

01:05:52.219 --> 01:05:56.256
Hen, you're the only person
that wanted this.

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.527
- Just you.
- I can't not see my kids, Andy.

01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:03.030
Did you ever think
maybe they don't wanna see you?

01:06:03.063 --> 01:06:05.265
All you do is hurt them...

01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:06.601
and yourself.

01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:10.037
And let's be honest,

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:13.173
they're not gonna make this trip
up to this shithole to visit...

01:06:13.207 --> 01:06:14.542
Fuck you, Andy!

01:06:14.576 --> 01:06:17.512
Go back
to your suburban pacifier.

01:06:17.545 --> 01:06:19.379
I'm gonna get a lawyer
to fix this.

01:06:19.413 --> 01:06:22.015
- I'll get a lawyer to fix this.
- Good luck.

01:06:22.049 --> 01:06:24.117
Don't forget,
you wanted this. Not me.

01:06:24.151 --> 01:06:26.654
- Not like this. It's not fair.
- No. What's not fair is bailing

01:06:26.688 --> 01:06:29.791
and thinking you have the same
rights as a responsible parent.

01:06:29.824 --> 01:06:31.559
- Oh!
- Fuck!

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.496
What the fuck are you doing?

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.197
Who the fuck are you?

01:06:37.231 --> 01:06:39.399
Oh, wow. He even legal?

01:06:39.433 --> 01:06:41.603
It's not... It's not
what it looks like, Andy.

01:06:41.636 --> 01:06:44.137
Wait till the kids find out
Mom's banging a boy.

01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:46.508
Good luck finding a lawyer
in butt-fuck nowhere.

01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:49.409
Leave me alone!
Why are you following me?

01:06:49.443 --> 01:06:51.478
What the fuck do you want?

01:06:51.513 --> 01:06:53.146
- Who was that man?
- My husband.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.382
It's none
of your goddamn business.

01:06:55.415 --> 01:06:57.217
You have a husband?

01:06:57.251 --> 01:06:59.787
- What do you mean?
- Get the fuck away from my truck!

01:07:11.799 --> 01:07:14.268
I don't know
how to get home from here.

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:17.404
Jesus H. Christ.

01:07:33.487 --> 01:07:35.389
Jake, you need
to go home right now.

01:07:35.422 --> 01:07:38.225
- Who are you?
- You need to leave.

01:07:38.258 --> 01:07:39.727
How could you do this to me?

01:07:41.663 --> 01:07:44.566
Yes, Jake,
I have an ex-husband.

01:07:44.599 --> 01:07:47.167
And I have two kids. You don't
know anything about it.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.836
You don't need to know
anything about it.

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:51.271
And you don't get to judge me.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:56.243
I betrayed my father,
and for what?

01:07:56.276 --> 01:07:58.278
People did awful things
during the wars,

01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:02.717
but I would never, ever leave
my family or betray my wife.

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.686
What wars?

01:08:04.719 --> 01:08:07.722
World War III.
Man's last mistake.

01:08:07.755 --> 01:08:09.189
World War III?

01:08:09.222 --> 01:08:10.758
December 11th, 2002.

01:08:13.226 --> 01:08:14.461
December...

01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:19.801
December...

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:22.502
Oh, God. I know this date.

01:08:22.537 --> 01:08:24.572
Yeah. It rewrote history.

01:08:26.674 --> 01:08:27.809
No.

01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:31.345
There was no World War III.

01:08:36.283 --> 01:08:39.921
What happened to your mother
and you that day was awful,

01:08:39.953 --> 01:08:41.856
but there was no world war.

01:08:41.889 --> 01:08:45.425
What are you talking about?
Why are you lying?

01:08:47.194 --> 01:08:48.362
Jake.

01:08:48.395 --> 01:08:51.430
I'm so sorry, Jake.

01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:53.801
I have no idea
what kind of fucked-up shit

01:08:53.835 --> 01:08:57.537
your father has been telling you
all cooped up out in the woods,

01:08:57.572 --> 01:09:01.274
but there was no World War III.

01:09:01.308 --> 01:09:03.810
He kidnapped you, and he tried
to kill your mother.

01:09:03.845 --> 01:09:06.613
- Stop lying to me!
- Okay. I can't do this.

01:09:06.648 --> 01:09:08.850
I have my own shit to deal with.

01:09:28.603 --> 01:09:30.470
Where did you get this?

01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:37.344
Do you know where that man is?

01:09:39.913 --> 01:09:41.247
What is this?

01:09:42.482 --> 01:09:45.419
I need to know who this man is!

01:09:45.452 --> 01:09:47.622
Don't come here again.

01:10:19.754 --> 01:10:21.723
You decided to come back.

01:10:24.592 --> 01:10:25.927
I want the truth.

01:10:27.929 --> 01:10:29.964
- About what?
- About everything.

01:10:31.766 --> 01:10:33.835
I have never lied to you
about anything.

01:10:35.536 --> 01:10:37.004
What about the wars?

01:10:38.673 --> 01:10:41.308
There were no marauders,

01:10:41.341 --> 01:10:42.510
gangs of limbless men,

01:10:42.543 --> 01:10:44.645
psychos trying
to kill each other.

01:10:44.679 --> 01:10:46.313
You need to go further, Jake.

01:10:46.346 --> 01:10:49.751
Then you will see
the fucked-up, damaged world.

01:10:51.753 --> 01:10:53.755
Did World War III happen?

01:10:57.992 --> 01:10:59.527
Did the wars happen?

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.596
- Yes.
- Lying.

01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:05.398
December 11th, 2002.

01:11:05.432 --> 01:11:08.035
The day humanity died.
Shit hit the fan.

01:11:09.369 --> 01:11:10.938
So there was no real war?

01:11:10.972 --> 01:11:13.641
A conventional war, no,
but a war nonetheless.

01:11:13.674 --> 01:11:15.510
We barely escaped.

01:11:23.518 --> 01:11:24.852
Why did we kill this man?

01:11:24.886 --> 01:11:28.623
Why do we kill any men?
It's us or them.

01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:33.561
There's a family looking
for this man. A little girl.

01:11:33.594 --> 01:11:36.631
Dad, why did we kill him?

01:11:36.664 --> 01:11:38.699
He was gonna kill us, Jake.

01:11:38.733 --> 01:11:41.334
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:11:41.368 --> 01:11:44.806
Dad, that man said
something to me before he died.

01:11:44.839 --> 01:11:47.809
He was dying and he knew it,
and all he said to me was:

01:11:47.842 --> 01:11:50.678
"Tell my daughter
that I love her."

01:11:51.846 --> 01:11:54.816
You are out of your depths, son.

01:11:56.383 --> 01:11:59.587
The human species
has gone AWOL.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.089
They don't know what's
right or wrong any longer.

01:12:05.059 --> 01:12:06.694
What happened to her?

01:12:08.729 --> 01:12:09.997
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:12:10.031 --> 01:12:12.767
I wanna know
what this lying whore

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.702
has been filling your head with.

01:12:14.735 --> 01:12:16.503
Nothing. She's not...

01:12:18.405 --> 01:12:20.107
I just want the truth, Dad.

01:12:21.742 --> 01:12:23.544
You want the truth?

01:12:23.578 --> 01:12:24.745
I wanna know who she is.

01:12:24.779 --> 01:12:26.614
- Who is she?
- It doesn't matter.

01:12:26.647 --> 01:12:29.083
Is she the woman
that you said you'd killed?

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.522
Did you fuck her?

01:12:34.555 --> 01:12:35.957
Yes, Dad.

01:12:38.059 --> 01:12:40.528
And I bet in that moment,
you felt better

01:12:40.561 --> 01:12:42.864
than you ever had
in the whole world.

01:12:45.066 --> 01:12:48.002
And then she fucked you over,
didn't she?

01:12:51.005 --> 01:12:52.740
She lied to me.

01:12:55.009 --> 01:12:56.577
She has a family.

01:12:57.778 --> 01:12:59.881
She abandoned her family.

01:13:04.085 --> 01:13:06.787
I know how much
that can hurt, son.

01:13:08.022 --> 01:13:11.058
You have fallen prey
to the world.

01:13:11.092 --> 01:13:13.628
Like I always said
you would.

01:13:15.563 --> 01:13:17.632
People seem good...

01:13:18.766 --> 01:13:20.101
but they are not.

01:13:21.836 --> 01:13:24.105
I tried to protect you
from all this.

01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:26.974
It really felt
like I could trust her.

01:13:27.008 --> 01:13:30.778
It's okay, son. Sometimes
we have to learn the hard way.

01:13:32.546 --> 01:13:34.782
They're all liars.

01:13:34.815 --> 01:13:37.084
I have told you this
so many times.

01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:41.055
I know.

01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:43.057
Then why don't you believe me?

01:13:44.992 --> 01:13:46.493
I don't know.

01:13:46.527 --> 01:13:48.162
Do you not trust me?

01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:56.971
Do you believe there are
good people out there, Dad?

01:13:58.973 --> 01:14:02.610
They're all filthy,
lying, greedy cheaters.

01:14:04.245 --> 01:14:06.814
It takes time for some of them
to reveal their true colors,

01:14:06.847 --> 01:14:08.716
but can't trust a one of them.

01:14:08.749 --> 01:14:10.483
How do you know for sure?

01:14:10.518 --> 01:14:14.155
With age and wisdom,
you earn the power of judgment.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.962
Did she give this to you?

01:14:24.298 --> 01:14:25.866
She found it.

01:14:27.601 --> 01:14:29.670
Does she know you know him?

01:14:40.915 --> 01:14:42.850
She needs to die, Jake.

01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:48.255
Does she have to?

01:14:48.289 --> 01:14:51.192
Do you want them to take
all of this away from us?

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:53.060
To take us away
from each another?

01:14:53.094 --> 01:14:55.696
Why would they take us away
from each other?

01:14:55.730 --> 01:14:58.265
To protect us from them.

01:14:58.299 --> 01:15:02.303
I've had to do things
that they deem wrong

01:15:02.336 --> 01:15:04.672
but I know are right.

01:15:06.607 --> 01:15:08.009
You see?

01:15:10.778 --> 01:15:13.147
I gotta go finish
breaking that deer down.

01:15:14.682 --> 01:15:16.617
You pack our bags.

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:19.020
We leave before nightfall.

01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:30.965
Yes, sir.

01:16:17.411 --> 01:16:19.747
What are you doing?

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.248
We can't kill her, Dad.

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:24.718
She's probably just like us.

01:16:24.752 --> 01:16:26.153
She's made mistakes,
just like us.

01:16:26.187 --> 01:16:28.255
But you don't kill someone
for that.

01:16:28.289 --> 01:16:30.825
You can't be certain
of that, Jake.

01:16:32.726 --> 01:16:35.329
But what I can be certain of

01:16:35.362 --> 01:16:39.233
is once she is dead, she will
no longer be a danger to us.

01:16:40.801 --> 01:16:42.937
I'm not certain.

01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:46.073
But I am willing to bet my life
in place of hers.

01:16:47.942 --> 01:16:49.343
You really mean that?

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.850
Well, for both our sakes,
I hope you're not wrong.

01:16:56.951 --> 01:16:59.353
Dad, let me go to her.

01:16:59.386 --> 01:17:01.722
I can trick her,

01:17:01.755 --> 01:17:03.324
make her feel safe and warm,

01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:06.827
and she will never be
a problem for us ever again.

01:17:13.033 --> 01:17:15.002
I'm trusting you with this.

01:17:23.944 --> 01:17:25.279
I wanna show you something

01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:27.414
I should've shown you
a long time ago.

01:17:28.816 --> 01:17:30.117
Come on.

01:17:40.427 --> 01:17:41.962
Go on.

01:17:43.464 --> 01:17:44.965
All the way in there.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.269
All the way to the back.

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.705
Sometimes the things we do
in life

01:17:51.739 --> 01:17:54.475
don't make sense straightaway,

01:17:54.509 --> 01:17:56.277
but in time they do.

01:18:01.382 --> 01:18:03.117
I'm sorry, Jake.

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:05.953
But you don't understand
what is going on here.

01:18:05.986 --> 01:18:09.023
That woman is a poison
in our world.

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:14.995
Let me out!

01:18:15.029 --> 01:18:17.932
You shouldn't have lied
about killing her!

01:18:17.965 --> 01:18:19.166
Dad! Dad, listen to me.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.935
I promise
she's not gonna hurt us.

01:18:20.968 --> 01:18:23.971
You may be willing to risk
your life for her, but I am not!

01:18:24.004 --> 01:18:26.307
I know what women
like that can do!

01:18:29.076 --> 01:18:32.379
Dad. Dad, Dad. Listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:18:32.413 --> 01:18:35.482
She's not gonna hurt us,
I promise you.

01:18:35.517 --> 01:18:37.151
She's not gonna hurt us.

01:18:38.219 --> 01:18:39.920
I'm going now.

01:18:43.023 --> 01:18:45.025
I'm gonna clean up your mess.

01:18:45.059 --> 01:18:46.393
You fucking liar!

01:18:52.866 --> 01:18:54.335
You said you never
met the father.

01:18:54.368 --> 01:18:56.136
- I haven't.
- The son never mentioned anything

01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:57.838
- about the missing hunter?
- Um...

01:18:57.871 --> 01:19:00.007
- So it could be Jake.
- No.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.009
No? You said he attacked
your husband?

01:19:02.042 --> 01:19:05.412
- He... It was a misunderstanding.
- A violent misunderstanding.

01:19:05.446 --> 01:19:07.481
Jake is not a killer.

01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:09.016
So after the flyer business,

01:19:09.049 --> 01:19:12.086
he just disappeared
into the woods, roughly?

01:19:12.119 --> 01:19:16.290
He was really upset
and he went into the woods, yes.

01:19:16.323 --> 01:19:18.425
Me and one of the boys will
escort you back for safety.

01:19:18.459 --> 01:19:21.362
There's only one other trooper
and he's four hours behind us.

01:19:21.395 --> 01:19:23.464
Oh, no, no, no.
That's... I'm fine.

01:19:23.497 --> 01:19:25.533
I'm fine. Thank you, though.

01:20:01.569 --> 01:20:04.171
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:20:04.204 --> 01:20:06.006
Let him go. Let him go.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.441
Don't look at him.
Leave him alone.

01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:09.310
You fucking leave him alone!
Troy...

01:20:09.343 --> 01:20:10.978
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:20:52.186 --> 01:20:53.521
Henrietta?

01:21:07.535 --> 01:21:10.504
- We just wanna have a look-see.
- Is that really necessary?

01:21:11.639 --> 01:21:13.140
Stop!

01:21:13.173 --> 01:21:15.275
Jake! No, they're cops!

01:21:15.309 --> 01:21:17.579
Put the gun down.
They're here to help us.

01:21:20.981 --> 01:21:23.618
Put the gun on the ground
and drop to your knees!

01:21:23.651 --> 01:21:25.452
No, no, no. He's fine.

01:21:25.486 --> 01:21:28.556
It's okay.
He didn't know. He doesn't know.

01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:31.225
Henrietta, you need
to move to the side.

01:21:31.258 --> 01:21:34.361
He doesn't...
He didn't mean any harm. I promise.

01:21:34.395 --> 01:21:36.664
Put the gun on the ground.

01:21:41.569 --> 01:21:42.903
Hey!

01:21:45.472 --> 01:21:46.608
Stay with me.

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:50.377
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not fucking okay!

01:21:50.411 --> 01:21:52.179
- What the fuck is happening?
- I'm sorry.

01:21:52.212 --> 01:21:55.249
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's not your fault.

01:21:55.282 --> 01:21:58.419
It's my father.
He's coming to kill you.

01:21:59.754 --> 01:22:01.088
Oh, my God.

01:22:03.457 --> 01:22:05.325
We need to get you
somewhere safe.

01:22:05.359 --> 01:22:08.095
No, I have an idea. The preps.

01:22:10.698 --> 01:22:12.734
Okay. I gotta go now.

01:22:12.767 --> 01:22:16.571
Remember, do not backtrack.
He'll be following my tracks.

01:22:16.604 --> 01:22:18.205
Okay. Go.

01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:17.498
Dad!

01:23:20.234 --> 01:23:21.636
I know you're here!

01:23:22.770 --> 01:23:25.105
Where is she?

01:23:25.138 --> 01:23:27.407
No.

01:23:27.441 --> 01:23:31.245
- This has to happen, Jake.
- No, it doesn't.

01:23:31.278 --> 01:23:33.515
She's a good person.

01:23:33.548 --> 01:23:36.483
She shouldn't fucking die
because you're not.

01:23:46.528 --> 01:23:48.530
One day you'll understand.

01:24:05.345 --> 01:24:08.650
Okay. Please, help, please!
Please help.

01:24:19.192 --> 01:24:20.460
Fuck!

01:24:32.239 --> 01:24:33.440
Fuck!

01:24:43.685 --> 01:24:45.887
You should never
have left your family

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.689
and started fucking with mine.

01:25:14.214 --> 01:25:15.717
You women,

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:19.520
you think you can
just fuck up a man's life

01:25:19.554 --> 01:25:22.255
and there'd be no consequences!

01:25:22.289 --> 01:25:23.758
Well, I got news for you.

01:25:24.959 --> 01:25:26.561
Not me!

01:25:29.897 --> 01:25:35.369
You children can continue
to fuck up the world...

01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:52.486
but you are not
corrupting my son.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:04.565
It is snakes like you
that are ruining humanity.

01:26:08.435 --> 01:26:10.370
Poisoning my son...

01:26:15.342 --> 01:26:17.812
will be the last mistake...

01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:19.580
you make.

01:28:53.568 --> 01:28:54.836
Here.

01:29:05.012 --> 01:29:06.714
I love you, boy.

01:29:13.821 --> 01:29:15.756
It was all for love.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.895
Now...

01:29:34.508 --> 01:29:35.743
go on.

01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:38.179
No.

01:29:38.212 --> 01:29:40.882
- No, Dad.
- Go on.

01:29:40.915 --> 01:29:42.049
Hey...

01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:47.154
this is not a democracy.

01:31:18.112 --> 01:31:21.649
<i>I didn't realize
it right then and there,</i>

01:31:21.682 --> 01:31:24.652
<i>but my faith in humanity</i>

01:31:24.685 --> 01:31:27.021
<i>was pretty close
to your father's.</i>

01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:34.195
<i>Truly, I fear that I could've
ended up just like him,</i>

01:31:34.228 --> 01:31:37.698
<i>isolated and bitter
at the world.</i>

01:31:39.567 --> 01:31:43.771
<i>It took him almost killing us
for me to realize</i>

01:31:43.804 --> 01:31:46.741
<i>just how far
I had let myself go.</i>

01:31:50.011 --> 01:31:52.046
<i>And while
I still struggle at times</i>

01:31:52.079 --> 01:31:54.648
<i>with the world
we live in today,</i>

01:31:54.682 --> 01:31:58.185
<i>you gave me something back
I was missing:</i>

01:31:58.219 --> 01:32:02.790
<i>The belief there is
still good in the world.</i>

01:32:07.695 --> 01:32:10.064
<i>I thank you for that, Jake.</i>

01:32:10.097 --> 01:32:13.167
<i>It's the greatest gift
a person could give.</i>

01:32:23.277 --> 01:32:24.779
Mom?

01:32:26.714 --> 01:32:28.049
You ready?

01:32:48.269 --> 01:32:50.738
<i>I didn't know about this one.</i>

01:32:53.007 --> 01:32:54.775
<i>It's outside the perimeter.</i>

01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:58.279
<i>Dad called this area
No Man's Land.</i>

01:33:13.761 --> 01:33:16.363
<i>I don't know how I feel
about luck these days.</i>

01:33:19.033 --> 01:33:20.835
<i>I know I'm prepared
for the worst</i>

01:33:20.868 --> 01:33:23.037
<i>if that should ever
actually happen.</i>

01:33:27.274 --> 01:33:28.609
<i>But really...</i>

01:33:30.744 --> 01:33:32.213
<i>I'm just hopeful.</i>

01:33:35.749 --> 01:33:37.384
<i>Hopeful for my future.</i>

01:33:40.788 --> 01:33:42.790
<i>Hopeful for this world.</i>

01:33:55.436 --> 01:33:57.037
Please be you.
