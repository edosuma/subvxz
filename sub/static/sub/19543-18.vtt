00:02.503 --> 00:06.746
Goku and Kuririn had let Vegeta get away.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.331
The battle was over.

00:11.804 --> 00:15.672
The group becomes conscious of a new goal,

00:15.766 --> 00:20.260
that of gathering other Dragon
Balls to save their friends.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.350
Planet Namek or bust!

Dragon Soul!

01:52.571 --> 01:59.238
"The Ship Resting in Yunzabit!
Time to Blast Off for Planet Namek. "

02:04.041 --> 02:05.156
"Son Goku"
"Son Gohan"

02:05.417 --> 02:07.453
Man, we sure were lucky, huh?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.626
They say that Gohan and I
need to stay here for three days,

02:09.713 --> 02:11.044
and then we'll be good as new.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.087
Ooh, you've got me beat.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.042
They told me it would take four
months for my injuries to heal.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.299
They also said I might not
ever be back to normal again.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.721
Hey, you've got nothing to worry about.

02:21.809 --> 02:26.519
In another month or so, some
new senzu beans will be ready.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.893
You know, you look just like a mummy.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.350
And after the punishin' I took,
they ain't even admittin' me.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.983
Yeah, when Yajirobe was about
to get pounded by that Saiyan,

02:37.074 --> 02:39.360
he °
was all like, "I'm sorry!

02:39.451 --> 02:43.490
I really respect you! Let's be friends!"

02:43.580 --> 02:45.445
Why, you! I'll knock yer block off!

02:45.541 --> 02:48.453
| just did that to get him off guard!

02:50.295 --> 02:54.163
Anyway, you all really did good.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.998
Nothin' could make me happier.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.256
Plus, it looks like the ones who
died will be comin' back to life.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.679
Hey, guys, guys, the TV! Look at the TV!

03:02.766 --> 03:04.552
Oh, it's you, Bulma.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.009
I thought you might have
been a funny-looking nurse.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.813
You just hush! Here, watch the TV.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.608
This object, which was discovered
in the devastation of Metro East,

03:14.695 --> 03:16.526
appears to be a vehicle from space,

03:16.613 --> 03:18.865
though that cannot be confirmed.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.814
That's it! That's the Saiyan's!

03:20.909 --> 03:23.742
--I know, right?
--|-| can't see!

03:23.829 --> 03:25.569
Reports are that at the time
of the discovery of this object,

03:25.664 --> 03:28.121
there were apparently two of them,

03:28.208 --> 03:30.415
but one of them suddenly
flew away from the site.

03:30.502 --> 03:35.246
This isn't good. Those scientists
have already carried it away.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.001
This will be fun, won't it?

03:37.092 --> 03:39.048
Let's use the remote control
that Kuririn brought along

03:39.136 --> 03:41.343
and call that thing over here.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.716
I'm sure it will surprise them.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.968
Are you sure that's a good idea?

03:46.059 --> 03:49.051
What are you talking about? I'm a genius.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.764
I spent last night examining
this thing. Watch this!

03:52.858 --> 03:54.689
Okay, beep, beep, beep...

03:54.776 --> 03:57.108
Ready? Here it goes...

04:00.616 --> 04:03.278
I wanna see, too!

04:06.747 --> 04:10.285
T-The object has suddenly exploded!
What could have happened?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.538
There is wreckage from the object
scattered all over the place!

04:14.796 --> 04:16.081
W-Why?

04:16.173 --> 04:19.711
Could that have been the self-destruct button?!

04:19.801 --> 04:22.087
What do we do?! Without that spaceship,

04:22.179 --> 04:24.795
we can't go to Planet Namek!

04:24.890 --> 04:26.926
Our last hope...

04:27.017 --> 04:29.053
...completely wiped out.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.100
It's hopeless now.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.935
This is what happens when you
find strange remote controls!

04:36.026 --> 04:39.439
Bulma-san, you're the one who
pushed the buttons indiscriminately.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.065
Hey.

04:44.076 --> 04:46.692
Hi.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.743
Mister Popo!

04:50.749 --> 04:54.662
Somebody come with me. There is spaceship.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.870
A spaceship? For real, Popo-san?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.205
Probably.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.505
W-Who is that?

05:00.592 --> 05:01.877
That's Mister Popo.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.675
Mister Popo?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.878
He stays with Kami-sama up at his place.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.929
But he's been up there at Kami's palace

05:08.016 --> 05:12.009
much, much longer than the current Kami-sama.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.021
Say, what do you mean, "probably"?

05:16.108 --> 05:18.224
It probably...

05:18.318 --> 05:22.482
...spaceship. But Mister Popo not quite sure.

05:22.572 --> 05:27.692
Somebody come along, examine it.
Mister Popo lead way.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.367
Bulma-san!

05:30.998 --> 05:31.908
Me?!

05:31.999 --> 05:38.120
Well, Bulma-san, nobody else here
knows anything about spaceships.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.623
Bulma-san?

05:39.715 --> 05:43.207
A-Are you sure this guy is all right?

05:43.301 --> 05:45.883
Isn't there something dodgy about his eyes?

05:47.000 --> 05:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:59.234 --> 06:01.691
E-Easy...

06:07.993 --> 06:10.234
We're counting on you, Bulma.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.943
Be careful with me as we go, now.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.370
Okay, we go.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.790
Gently... gently, now...

06:25.886 --> 06:26.921
Here we are.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.968
Huh? Already?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.273
Get off.

06:41.359 --> 06:45.068
Where is this place? It's pretty cold here.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.397
Yunzabit Highlands.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.653
Yunzabit?!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.405
That's the other side of the Earth, you know!

06:52.496 --> 06:56.364
We came all the way here in that one instant?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.198
Where was it...?

06:58.293 --> 07:00.409
This way?

07:00.504 --> 07:02.995
J-Just a minute!

07:07.427 --> 07:11.921
Hey, you mean there's something
like a spaceship around here?

07:12.015 --> 07:14.757
Hey, are you listening to me?

07:22.984 --> 07:26.192
You haven't brought me
to this godforsaken place

07:26.279 --> 07:30.022
in order to do something pervy with me, right?

07:33.203 --> 07:35.694
--H-Hey!
--Come quick.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.498
Y-You're kidding, right? I can't do that--

07:42.212 --> 07:44.123
Geez...

07:50.262 --> 07:51.968
This.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.681
Is this spaceship?

08:03.775 --> 08:06.107
I'll have to look closer.

08:12.576 --> 08:17.491
W-What is this? It's not metal. Is this...

08:17.581 --> 08:22.166
Hey, what's going on here?
Tell me what on earth this thing is.

08:23.795 --> 08:29.290
About 100 years ago, Kami-sama
told Mister Popo about past.

08:29.384 --> 08:33.217
When Kami-sama was child,
lived here in Yunzabit.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.386
Mister Popo asked him,

08:35.472 --> 08:38.431
"Yunzabit is remote land. Nobody live there.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.100
Why you live in that place?"

08:41.188 --> 08:44.396
I don't know why I was in that place.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.347
Apparently, I bumped my head,

08:46.443 --> 08:49.776
and all of my memories up until then were lost.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.444
Had no parents?

08:51.531 --> 08:55.023
No, I didn't. The only thing
I had was a letter that said,

08:55.118 --> 08:57.404
"Wait here, we'll come later."

08:57.495 --> 09:00.453
What does that mean?
I don't see where this is going.

09:00.540 --> 09:05.204
When Kami-sama was child,
waited long time for parents.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.753
My house was right there, in Yunzabit.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.833
I believed that my parents
would surely come back for me.

09:12.928 --> 09:17.763
But no matter how long I waited,
nobody ever came.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.226
I wonder how long I must have waited.

09:20.310 --> 09:25.145
20 years? Oh, no, perhaps 30.

09:25.232 --> 09:29.475
I finally gave up, left my house
behind, and departed Yunzabit.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.776
I would go back once in a while to look in on it,

09:31.863 --> 09:34.240
but nothing ever changed.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.816
So listen, what does any of
that have to do with this?

09:37.911 --> 09:42.075
You impatient. Now getting to point.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.828
Though, you know, thinking back
on it now, it was an odd house.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.376
I didn't realize it until I
learned more about the world,

09:48.463 --> 09:51.170
but that house was really unusual.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.374
It was round, with four legs attached to it,

09:53.468 --> 09:55.299
almost like some sort of bug.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.924
The door didn't have any knobs or locks,

09:58.014 --> 10:00.050
but would open when you spoke to it.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.881
"Piccolo."

10:01.977 --> 10:03.513
P--?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.100
An entrance...

10:11.361 --> 10:13.602
Get on top of here.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.700
This is Kami-sama's house?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.869
Say again, and it closes.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.947
"Piccolo."

10:32.090 --> 10:37.801
Look closely. This not house, but spaceship, yes?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.629
That's right! Kami-sama is a Namekian!

10:40.724 --> 10:42.589
That Kaio person did say that long ago,

10:42.684 --> 10:45.892
Planet Namek was nearly wiped out
by abnormal climate, or whatnot.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.471
Mister Popo also heard Kaio-sama speak.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.605
Thought "what if, " came here, and found this.

10:53.695 --> 10:58.439
It's true, if this really is a spaceship,
it would all make sense.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.819
When Planet Namek had crisis,

11:00.910 --> 11:05.153
Kami-sama's parents put child
Kami-sama aboard, and sent to Earth.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.365
His parents planned to escape afterward,

11:08.460 --> 11:11.202
but there was some accident...

11:11.296 --> 11:13.833
Yeah! I mean, any way you look at it,

11:13.923 --> 11:15.959
this doesn't seem like a house.

11:16.051 --> 11:20.465
l-lt must be... a spaceship!

11:20.555 --> 11:23.342
But even if that's the case, can we use it?

11:23.433 --> 11:26.800
The entrance worked,
so it must have some power.

11:26.895 --> 11:31.980
Is this the main switch? No. Let's see, this...

11:36.029 --> 11:37.769
That's not right, either.

11:37.864 --> 11:42.403
That's strange. I wonder if there's
a code number or something.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.861
It doesn't look like this operates using buttons.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.991
I don't get it.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.916
I wonder if this is some kind of sensor.

11:51.002 --> 11:51.957
Voice?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.832
Yeah! It uses words, like the entrance did!

11:54.923 --> 11:57.005
What to say? " Piccolo"?

11:57.092 --> 12:01.631
No. After all, that was the
word for going in or out.

12:01.721 --> 12:06.306
Move, you hear me? Fly! Let me see you fly!

12:06.393 --> 12:09.351
That won't work. The language is different.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.814
You have to speak Namekian.

12:11.898 --> 12:15.140
I mean, back when Son-kun
fought against Piccolo,

12:15.235 --> 12:18.443
I heard him speaking in some weird language.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.488
That must be Namekian.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.032
If that Namekian, Mister Popo knows it.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.610
--Really?!
--Really.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.196
Word "Piccolo" means
"other world" in that language.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.373
So, is word for entrance.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.952
Why didn't you say so sooner?

12:36.047 --> 12:40.507
So Piccolo Daimao is the
"Demon King of Another World."

12:40.593 --> 12:42.800
Here, try telling it to fly.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.752
Fly to where?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.884
Anywhere is fine.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.466
I know, how about the Jupiter area?

12:49.561 --> 12:52.177
Topul kuppa koloppungo.

13:13.793 --> 13:18.378
|-|ncredible! It's Jupiter!
This is an incredible spaceship!

13:18.465 --> 13:22.003
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

13:23.720 --> 13:28.510
Thank goodness.
Now Kami-sama sure to come back.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.657
The spaceship is perfect!

13:51.748 --> 13:55.832
That ship can get to Planet
Namek in just one month!

13:55.919 --> 13:58.535
| just have to convert
the inside a little bit, and...

13:58.630 --> 14:01.997
...hmm, yeah, it can launch in another five days.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.673
To Planet Namek in Kami-sama's spaceship, huh?

14:04.761 --> 14:07.719
That faint bit of light is about to come true.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.341
With that being said, Popo-san,

14:09.432 --> 14:11.764
we're counting on you to go to Planet Namek.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.809
Eh? Mister Popo cannot go.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.807
Mister Popo cannot go.

14:16.898 --> 14:20.482
Would be away from Kami-sama's
palace for two months. Cannot do.

14:20.568 --> 14:25.153
Come on! After all, you're the only
one who can speak Namekian!

14:25.240 --> 14:26.320
You seem pretty tough, too.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.443
Popo-san, you're the only one we can ask to go.

14:28.535 --> 14:32.119
No worry. Will teach you Namekian.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.696
Then, Bulma-san, you'll have to go.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.702
If anything were to happen, Bulma-san,

14:36.793 --> 14:38.579
you're the only one familiar
with mechanical stuff.

14:38.670 --> 14:42.538
Fine. It doesn't seem particularly dangerous.

14:42.632 --> 14:46.625
But I'm not going there by myself,
understand? Someone come with me.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.461
I'm tellin' ya right now, no way in hell am | goin'.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.512
--We wouldn't expect it of you.
--Son-kun is all laid up.

14:51.599 --> 14:54.966
--What?!
--Kuririn, you'll come with me, right?

14:55.061 --> 14:59.395
M-Me? I don't really mind.

14:59.482 --> 15:02.064
Sounds nice. I wish I could go, too.

15:02.151 --> 15:06.360
I want to see what kind of Shen Long
would appear in Planet Namek.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.608
Now, Goku, you take it easy,

15:08.700 --> 15:10.861
and come up with some
countermeasure against the Saiyan.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.944
Right. It's up to you two.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.744
U-Um...

15:17.959 --> 15:20.871
P-Please take me with you, too!

15:25.091 --> 15:29.505
G-Gohan-chan, what sort of
cockamamie jokes are you tellin'?

15:29.596 --> 15:34.386
It isn't a joke! |-| really do want to go.

15:34.475 --> 15:38.263
D-Don't be ridiculous. Another
two months, on top of all this?

15:38.354 --> 15:41.892
I'm sorry. I want to go, for all the world.

15:41.983 --> 15:45.066
I want to bring Piccolo-san
back to life with my own hands.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.109
What kind of nonsense are you talkin' about?!

15:47.196 --> 15:50.529
Sheesh, you haven't even healed all the way yet!

15:50.617 --> 15:52.198
Physically, I'm all right.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.243
W-What are you doin'?!

15:55.330 --> 15:57.662
S-Stop that, Gohan-chan!

15:57.749 --> 16:00.616
Please, take me with you.

16:00.710 --> 16:05.670
l-l forbid anythin' of the kind!
I absolutely forbid it! Two months!

16:05.757 --> 16:07.668
What about your cram school, and your lessons?!

16:07.759 --> 16:09.590
Piccolo doesn't have anythin' to do with this!

16:09.677 --> 16:13.590
You are a little boy! And boys
should behave like boys!

16:13.681 --> 16:15.842
Shut up!

16:19.437 --> 16:23.931
G-Gohan-chan has turned into a d-delinquent...

16:24.025 --> 16:26.812
M-Mother, right now...

16:26.903 --> 16:30.361
Right now really isn't the time to talk about that.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.315
We have to bring back to life the
people who fought so desperately,

16:33.409 --> 16:35.616
and died while trying to defend the Earth,

16:35.703 --> 16:38.570
and fight back against the Saiyans once again.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.782
I can... I can fight, too.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.334
l have to... l have to do something.

16:45.421 --> 16:49.585
Understand, Mother. I'm sorry.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.918
He's got you beat, Chichi.

16:53.012 --> 16:57.301
Let Gohan go off into space, with your blessin'.

16:57.392 --> 17:01.761
Gohan, attaboy. You really have gotten stronger.

17:01.854 --> 17:06.314
It'll be fine. No problem at all. Just leave it to us.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.438
There won't be any danger this time around.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.271
Can you learn Namekian in five days?

17:12.365 --> 17:16.108
Let's see. I'll have to input
it all into a translator,

17:16.202 --> 17:17.738
so I'll need ten days.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.411
All right, see you in ten days, at the Kame House!

17:21.790 --> 17:23.327
Right!

17:24.794 --> 17:28.958
And so, in the blink of an eye, ten days pass,

17:29.048 --> 17:32.586
and the day of the launch arrives.

17:32.677 --> 17:37.967
Whew, is this thing really going
to get us to Planet Namek?

17:38.057 --> 17:42.266
Quite a snappy little outfit there, Kuririn.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.561
You're not, by any chance, making
light of outer space, are you?

17:45.648 --> 17:50.733
I even cut my hair, since it would
be in the way inside my spacesuit!

18:06.586 --> 18:10.625
Is that really you, Gohan?!
What happened to your hair?!

18:10.715 --> 18:14.128
F-Father laughed at me, too.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.207
Say what you will,

18:15.303 --> 18:17.669
this is the first time mankind
is goin' out into space.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.846
Can't have him bein' unmannerly.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.595
We're counting on you. You be sure
you find those Dragon Balls, now.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.222
Right.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.435
"Piccolo."

18:41.621 --> 18:45.705
Grandpa, Mother,
Mr. Turtle Hermit, and Mr. Turtle,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.908
we're off! Take care.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.538
"Piccolo."

18:49.629 --> 18:51.870
Be sure you eat regularly.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.580
Send me a letter, every day.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.586
Bye, now.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.637
It's a little bit exciting, huh?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.685
Say, Bulma-san, where should we put our bags?

19:11.776 --> 19:14.984
Just put them any old place!
Hurry up and sit down!

19:15.071 --> 19:17.983
She's in a bad mood about something.

19:18.074 --> 19:22.408
Blast off in five seconds.
Destination, Planet Namek.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.578
J-J-Just a minute!

19:25.665 --> 19:28.077
4... 3...

19:28.167 --> 19:30.579
2... ’l...

19:32.380 --> 19:38.626
B-B-Bulma-san! W-W-We haven't
f-f-fastened our belts y-y-yet!

19:38.719 --> 19:43.884
That is incredible speed, to be sure.
They're out of sight already.

19:43.975 --> 19:47.968
Gohan-chan! Don't forget to rinse!

19:54.235 --> 19:56.567
Hmph, you're free to move around, now.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.146
Now that we're out of the
atmosphere, things will be calm.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.902
Already?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.779
Huh? What are you doing, Bulma-san?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.202
What a pest! I'm going to change my clothes!

20:06.289 --> 20:09.031
Change your clothes? You mean, into pajamas?

20:10.751 --> 20:14.744
Uh-oh. Come to think of it, | forgot my pajamas.

20:14.839 --> 20:19.333
--What about you, Gohan?
--I made sure to bring mine.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.292
Not that it's any of my business,

20:21.387 --> 20:24.754
but could you do something
about that Shichigosan outfit?

20:24.849 --> 20:26.385
This is just for the launch.

20:26.475 --> 20:31.219
Actually, I made some clothes,
and kept it a secret from Mother.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.935
Well?

20:40.323 --> 20:43.565
You really do respect Piccolo, don't you?

20:43.659 --> 20:46.696
Yes, about the same as Father.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.292
Those are unusual pajamas, huh?

20:55.379 --> 20:56.710
They look uncomfortable to sleep in.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.925
These aren't pajamas, you know.
Looking at you two,

21:00.009 --> 21:04.298
I felt like a fool for being so fired
up in getting ready for space.

21:05.431 --> 21:09.344
H-Hey, have we done something wrong?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.016
Beats me.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.230
With the prayers of Goku and the others aboard,

21:16.317 --> 21:20.435
the trio start their journey to Planet Namek...

21:20.529 --> 21:26.570
...little knowing the unearthly
terror that was in store for them.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Tobu n da mugen no sora e

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Mukoumizu tte saikou

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Hajiketobase kamehameha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
Yabame no kono jidai

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581

Kibou ga ore no buki dakara

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171

22:35.980 --> 22:38.096
Dear Gohan-chan, are you brushin' your teeth?

22:38.190 --> 22:41.557
Are you doin' your homework?
I'm about to get an ulcer from worryin'.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.984
I hear there are some out-of-this-world
strong guys on Planet Namek.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.447
Knowing you, Gohan, you'll be all right.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.522
You leave all the painful stuff to Kuririn,

22:47.616 --> 22:50.278
and stick to studyin' hard. Love, your mother.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.325
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.413 --> 22:55.576
"A Powerful New Foe!
The Emperor of the Universe, Freeza. "

22:55.666 --> 22:59.625
Father, there are a whole bunch of bad guys here!
