16:39.462 --> 16:45.962
What? No, no, no.
I'm just a businessman here.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.163
I'm a businessman.

16:47.167 --> 16:48.962

16:51.443 --> 16:53.344
But now...

16:56.014 --> 16:59.033
Now, God above has blessed
this great country with new riches,

16:59.043 --> 17:00.844
Mr. Seal.

17:02.984 --> 17:04.954
And you could help us.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.858
How's that?

17:10.028 --> 17:11.886
You know the routes.

17:11.955 --> 17:14.945
You can get in and out
<i>Estados Unidos</i> with your fancy plane.

17:19.398 --> 17:21.530

17:53.407 --> 17:55.396
Ma'am, what's in the bag?

17:58.945 --> 18:01.506
We decided to try new ideas.

18:02.487 --> 18:05.318
We want you
to take off from here.

18:05.323 --> 18:07.459
Fly directly to Miami.

18:07.464 --> 18:10.391
We'll pay you $2,000 per kilo.

18:16.469 --> 18:18.530
How much is a kilo?

18:18.731 --> 18:21.832
2.2 pounds, Mr. Seal.

18:29.412 --> 18:32.514
$2,000...

18:33.754 --> 18:35.715

<i>Si. Si</i>, terrible pilots.

19:16.241 --> 19:21.175
Yeah, well...
I'm sure they were heavy.

19:29.924 --> 19:32.546
Yeah, you know, this airport,
I mean it's...

19:32.551 --> 19:35.027
High altitude
and a short runway.

19:35.227 --> 19:38.348
I mean, shit, you got trees
and mountains on both sides.

19:44.439 --> 19:45.637
Is there uh,

19:45.837 --> 19:48.238
Is there somewhere else
I could take off from?

19:48.679 --> 19:51.881
Not where the army wouldn't notice.

19:51.911 --> 19:53.052
Well, uh...

19:54.153 --> 19:56.832
Can you make the runway longer?

20:08.674 --> 20:10.445
They say
I should get rid of you.

20:11.346 --> 20:13.304
That you can't do it.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.289
- We have our people in Miami.
- Yeah.

20:26.294 --> 20:30.458
You gonna land at the Okeechobee

20:30.498 --> 20:32.358
Look, there's uh...

20:32.398 --> 20:36.300
There's been a change of plans
'cause I ain't landin' in Miami...

20:36.340 --> 20:38.531
Oh, thank you. <i>Gracias.</i>

20:38.841 --> 20:41.713
See, I ain't landin'

20:41.718 --> 20:43.411

ya'll got in trouble.

20:43.441 --> 20:45.082
Now, look, just,
just hear me out.

20:45.282 --> 20:48.282
I know Louisiana.
Now, here's a map.

20:48.322 --> 20:52.344
Now, I'm gonna drop this stuff
right where "X" marks the spot.

20:52.394 --> 20:54.455
All right? Just...

20:55.464 --> 20:58.523

You just go around.

21:43.103 --> 21:45.374
No, no, no.

<i>- No, no. Si, si, Hasta arriba.</i>
- Guys, guys.

21:56.467 --> 22:00.377
It ain't about room, all right?
It's about weight.

I think that'd be cruel
and unusual punishment, right?

35:07.755 --> 35:11.497
Well, I'll be sure 'n give 'em a
good whup for it on Monday, though.

35:11.597 --> 35:13.567
All right.

35:25.610 --> 35:26.741
Thank you.

35:38.692 --> 35:40.532
Front door's open.

35:51.473 --> 35:53.674
Shh, it's okay.

35:56.756 --> 35:59.519
That's an easy fix.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.582
I gotta...

36:22.650 --> 36:24.711
Get in. Come on.

36:26.592 --> 36:28.553
Oh, shit.

36:30.523 --> 36:32.624
We gotta make this quick.

36:33.592 --> 36:36.534
She might leave me
before I get back.

36:44.607 --> 36:48.676
So, this is all yours.

36:48.681 --> 36:51.586
Including everything between
here and your house.

36:51.646 --> 36:53.647
Almost 2,000 acres.

36:53.757 --> 36:55.618
What do you think?

36:58.630 --> 37:00.489
I own all this?

37:00.559 --> 37:01.529
Oh, yeah.

37:06.740 --> 37:08.642
This whole airport?

37:08.672 --> 37:10.731
Yeah. Congratulations.

37:36.606 --> 37:38.537
AK-47s.

37:38.542 --> 37:41.448
Soviet-made for the PLO.

37:41.508 --> 37:46.611
The Israelis captured these,
and then secretly traded them to us.

37:47.592 --> 37:50.560
And you're gonna
fly them to Nicaragua.

37:50.590 --> 37:52.720
Uh, you didn't say
nothin' 'bout guns.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.491
It's a war, Barry.

37:55.496 --> 37:58.662
Freedom fighters can't put up
much of a fight if they aren't armed.

37:58.732 --> 38:00.633
This was the deal.

38:00.673 --> 38:03.530
Or would you rather be
in a Colombian prison?

38:05.671 --> 38:10.615
This is every current law enforcement
investigation in the Gulf Coast.

38:10.620 --> 38:14.516
FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs.

38:14.757 --> 38:17.518
These maps will help you
avoid all of 'em.

38:18.586 --> 38:20.756
Holy shit.

38:20.796 --> 38:24.596
You just fly where they ain't.

38:38.711 --> 38:41.481
Everything in this hangar's mine.

38:41.551 --> 38:42.541
Oh, yeah.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.622
That truck's mine.

38:44.627 --> 38:45.648
Mm-hmm.

38:45.653 --> 38:48.494
- Tools are mine.
- Yes, sir.

38:48.561 --> 38:50.533
This airplane is mine.

38:52.662 --> 38:54.633
Bag is mine.

38:55.764 --> 38:57.605
What bag?

39:22.569 --> 39:25.660
I fed the kids.
They're sleepin'.

39:27.511 --> 39:29.482
I unpacked the car.

39:29.572 --> 39:30.802
That is good.

39:31.511 --> 39:33.712
Fixed the sink.
Just the valve.

39:33.779 --> 39:36.751
See, I told you,
that was gonna be easy.

39:39.623 --> 39:40.683
Fuck, Barry!

39:40.723 --> 39:43.695
Okay, all right, all right.
Okay.

39:44.295 --> 39:46.497
Ima come clean.

39:48.198 --> 39:50.136
I don't work for TWA
no more.

39:50.141 --> 39:53.435
No shit, Barry.
Are you going to prison?

39:55.066 --> 39:56.266
No, ma'am.

39:59.578 --> 40:01.598
You gotta take care
of this family.

40:01.648 --> 40:02.778
'Cause I will take the kids.

40:02.783 --> 40:05.577
I will go right back to working
for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

40:05.677 --> 40:07.708
Luce, what I'm workin' on...

40:07.718 --> 40:10.490
- Barry, I'm six months pregnant.
- It's top secret.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.679
I need a fridge.

40:11.719 --> 40:13.631
I need beds for our children.

40:13.636 --> 40:16.622
I need a stove,
a fucking washing machine.

40:23.231 --> 40:25.292
Washing machine over there.

40:27.244 --> 40:29.175
Let me just...

40:37.415 --> 40:39.385
Is this all legal?

40:39.390 --> 40:44.187
All right, what I'm about to tell you...
Now, you-you...

40:44.297 --> 40:48.390
You gotta swear you can't
ever tell anybody this, Lucy.

40:50.238 --> 40:51.259
All right?

40:53.408 --> 40:59.171
I am working...
for the CIA.

41:01.671 --> 41:02.671
<i>Synced by
Roy_Neary</i>

42:05.863 --> 42:06.863
<i>Hola!</i>

42:08.764 --> 42:09.855
Howdy, <i>amigos</i>.

42:09.925 --> 42:12.795
I'm here on behalf
of Uncle Sam.

42:23.946 --> 42:26.709
Look, Schafer.
I ain't no military expert,

42:26.779 --> 42:28.840
but are you sure
these are the right guys?

42:28.850 --> 42:31.552
'Cause they seem a damn sight
more interested in my boots

42:31.557 --> 42:32.751
than in your guns.

42:32.791 --> 42:34.778
<i>Look, this is getting big time.</i>

42:34.828 --> 42:36.789
<i>Schafer, I just don't think
I'm the guy for this.</i>

42:36.794 --> 42:38.960
You just keep delivering
that pizza, you hear me?

42:38.965 --> 42:40.461
<i>You just keep delivering.</i>

42:52.114 --> 42:55.304
<i>Hola.</i> All right.

42:55.954 --> 42:57.945
These are gifts.

42:59.757 --> 43:00.777
All right?

43:00.987 --> 43:05.955
All right? Gifts.
<i>Regalos de mi.</i>

43:07.026 --> 43:09.898
Back off. Off.

43:12.299 --> 43:13.809
<i>Regalos.</i>

43:14.114 --> 43:15.250
<i>Amigos.</i>

43:15.850 --> 43:16.851
<i>Atras, atras.</i>

43:20.809 --> 43:24.769
Now, these guns
are gifts from Uncle Sam.

43:32.973 --> 43:34.524
I'm not fuckin' around.

43:35.562 --> 43:37.958
Barry! Put the bat down, <i>huevon!</i>

43:37.963 --> 43:39.904
We're all friends here.

43:39.974 --> 43:43.875
Jorge.
What the hell are you doing here?

43:43.945 --> 43:45.846
This is Don Adolfo Calero.

43:45.916 --> 43:48.617
He works for your
government on the revolution

43:48.622 --> 43:49.818
to bring down the Sandinistas.

43:49.848 --> 43:52.577
Jorge tells me you are
the crazy gringo

43:52.582 --> 43:53.975
who always delivers.

43:55.026 --> 43:57.858
We have a new business
proposition to you, Barry.

43:57.888 --> 44:00.801
You bring your American
guns to Colombia,

44:00.861 --> 44:03.960
deliver our cocaine here
to the Contras,

44:04.801 --> 44:07.859
the Contras take it by
fishing boats to Miami,

44:07.969 --> 44:09.840
and everybody's happy.

44:09.970 --> 44:14.442
It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal.

44:14.642 --> 44:16.643
<i>Lucho Castellanos y su Grupo -
"Bombo y Maracas"</i>

44:16.753 --> 44:18.874
<i>Turns out the Contras didn't really
want to fight a war.</i>

44:18.954 --> 44:21.943
<i>They just want to make money.
Like the rest of us.</i>

44:21.993 --> 44:25.953
<i>Meanwhile, the Medellin Cartel
wanted guns.</i>

44:25.993 --> 44:28.965
<i>So they worked out
a little trade.</i>

44:29.105 --> 44:30.165
<i>What was I gonna tell 'em?</i>

44:30.195 --> 44:32.934
I'm just a gringo
who always delivers.

44:33.766 --> 44:35.734
<i>Here's how the operation worked.</i>

44:35.804 --> 44:37.765
<i>I'd load up the guns at Mena.</i>

44:37.805 --> 44:41.838
<i>Then, using Schafer's intel,
I'd bypass any law enforcement</i>

44:41.878 --> 44:45.539
<i>and fly straight to the
Cartel's airstrip in Medellin.</i>

44:47.490 --> 44:50.362
<i>Colombians, well,
they love them guns.</i>

44:51.589 --> 44:53.393
<i>Then I'd load up with fresh powder</i>

44:53.398 --> 44:56.499
<i>and fly on to the
Contra training camp.</i>

44:57.430 --> 45:01.492
<i>The Contras hid the coke in
fishing boats and sailed it up to Miami.</i>

45:02.443 --> 45:04.432
<i>Meanwhile, I'd get
another load of powder,</i>

45:04.472 --> 45:07.602
<i>take it back to the States
with a quick stop to refuel in Panama,</i>

45:07.612 --> 45:11.444
<i>under the protection of
my old friend, Colonel Noriega.</i>

45:11.484 --> 45:13.644
Congratulations on your
promotion, General.

45:13.654 --> 45:16.515
<i>Of course, he'd get his cut too.</i>

45:17.456 --> 45:19.657
<i>On the way back,
I'd keep an eye out for the DEA.</i>

45:20.397 --> 45:22.556
<i>Then I'd dump it all
in the swamps in Louisiana.</i>

45:27.437 --> 45:31.429
<i>The operation got so big,
I had to get some help.</i>

45:31.509 --> 45:34.569
<i>Pete Dubois, manufactured guns
until he discovered</i>

45:34.609 --> 45:36.507
<i>he had a knack for selling pot.</i>

45:36.607 --> 45:40.379
<i>Stan Mason flew dope from
Mexico to Arizona.</i>

45:40.479 --> 45:41.510
<i>Bill Cooper,</i>

45:41.550 --> 45:45.391
<i>he flew opium all around
Southeast Asia during Vietnam.</i>

45:45.661 --> 45:48.393
<i>Then there's Bob.</i>

45:48.423 --> 45:51.552
<i>Uh, I don't know much about Bob.
Hell of a pilot, though.</i>

45:52.502 --> 45:55.562
<i>I call these boys my Snowbirds.</i>

45:55.602 --> 45:57.593
<i>And we could fly through anything.</i>

46:21.629 --> 46:23.360
Schafer.

46:23.598 --> 46:24.658
Barry.

46:26.408 --> 46:27.499
How's it going?

46:27.639 --> 46:29.400
Hey Boss!

46:29.510 --> 46:33.412
That was fucking crazy, man!

46:35.452 --> 46:38.581
How's it uh,
how's it going down there?

46:39.421 --> 46:40.512
Oh, you know...

46:41.422 --> 46:42.444
Busy.

46:44.694 --> 46:46.425
You?

46:47.436 --> 46:48.496
Oh, yeah.

46:49.706 --> 46:51.464
Busy.

47:00.547 --> 47:02.419
Where are they going?

47:03.449 --> 47:05.508
We need to borrow some
of your land.

47:07.557 --> 47:11.519
They want you to
fly 'em up here to-to train.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.454
For training.

47:13.459 --> 47:14.620
Who?

47:15.460 --> 47:16.591
The Contras.

47:21.441 --> 47:23.532
You want me to
bring 'em up here?

47:23.537 --> 47:24.706
To me?

47:24.711 --> 47:27.612
We're setting up a
field and operational training ground.

47:33.686 --> 47:35.585
Where? On...

47:35.655 --> 47:37.622
- My land?
- Yeah.

47:38.493 --> 47:39.654
Starting immediately.

47:39.694 --> 47:41.455
Which is great.

47:42.695 --> 47:44.525
Is that a problem?

47:44.535 --> 47:46.598
Uh... hey.

47:47.508 --> 47:49.499
Whatever you need, boss.

48:00.210 --> 48:01.212
<i>Que?</i>

48:01.412 --> 48:02.713
<i>Necesito un baño.</i>

48:04.912 --> 48:08.211
<i>Uh... no baño.</i>

48:27.615 --> 48:30.677
Hang on! We're supposed to have 15.
I'm only counting 12 here.

48:30.687 --> 48:33.658
Them Contras were damn excited
about being in the US of A.

48:34.557 --> 48:37.526
They were runnin' away almost
faster than we could bring 'em in.

48:41.698 --> 48:45.508
Hey, you two! Where do you
think you're going?

48:45.513 --> 48:47.600
What, you want to quadruple
the shipments?

48:47.680 --> 48:50.511
We're counting on the Contras
to win by summer if we...

48:50.516 --> 48:51.613
if we give 'em what they need.

48:51.653 --> 48:53.411
That's great.

48:53.451 --> 48:55.510
How much more can you get
out of your guy in Mena?

48:55.550 --> 48:57.421
We'll get everything out of him.

48:57.491 --> 48:58.512
That's what I like to hear.

48:59.563 --> 49:02.534
We're expanding operations, Barry.

49:02.539 --> 49:06.595
Come on. One at a time.
One at a time! Hey, hold on.

49:06.635 --> 49:08.662
No, no, no.

49:08.667 --> 49:10.573
We'll take care of everybody,
just <i>calma.</i>

49:11.804 --> 49:13.045
Back!

49:14.544 --> 49:15.705
Back!

49:15.905 --> 49:18.307
<i>Calma, calma.</i>

49:18.447 --> 49:20.578
Everyone just calm the fuck down!

49:40.570 --> 49:41.600
<i>Salud.</i>

49:45.742 --> 49:48.443
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah.

49:48.483 --> 49:50.455
Do you think those
Contras can win?

49:51.725 --> 49:52.693
No.

49:58.564 --> 49:59.495
Hi.

49:59.535 --> 50:02.627
This just came.
"Go Razorbacks, Barry."

50:02.707 --> 50:06.437
Season tickets.
50-yard line.

50:07.475 --> 50:09.536
Well, that was awful nice of him.

50:09.576 --> 50:12.548
How much property has Seal
bought us since he came to town?

50:13.478 --> 50:15.578
I don't know, 500 acres?

50:15.618 --> 50:18.679
2,000 acres.
From the airport to Ouachita.

50:18.689 --> 50:21.451
What's he want with all that
worthless land?

50:21.521 --> 50:24.550
It's really none of our business.
Really.

50:27.499 --> 50:29.692
He's good people, Judy.

50:29.702 --> 50:33.434
And he's doing a lot
for the community.

50:38.607 --> 50:40.638
I'd like to open a bank account.

50:41.749 --> 50:42.809
Oh, bless you!

50:43.750 --> 50:45.581
I'll be right back.

50:45.651 --> 50:46.712
David!

50:46.792 --> 50:48.623
Come on, Christina!

50:53.766 --> 50:54.796
Good job, guys.

50:55.577 --> 50:56.998
Woo!

50:57.878 --> 51:00.611
- Great, Christina!
- Go, go, go, go!

51:00.616 --> 51:01.842
Oranges. You guys
want some oranges?

51:01.882 --> 51:04.583
Hey guys, I got pizza!

51:04.583 --> 51:05.854
You guys want some pizza?

51:06.184 --> 51:09.626
Yeah! All right.
Let me just put this right...

51:14.739 --> 51:15.860
There you go.

51:22.684 --> 51:24.410
- Nice wheels!
- Oh, you like her?

51:24.415 --> 51:25.686
I do.

51:25.686 --> 51:26.846
1982.

51:26.856 --> 51:28.727
All the bells and whistles.

51:28.757 --> 51:31.859
First one in the State of Arkansas,
and she's yours.

51:32.401 --> 51:34.002
She's mine?

51:34.132 --> 51:35.703
She's yours.

51:35.733 --> 51:37.764
Oh, my God, Barry!

51:37.804 --> 51:39.835
Thank you!

51:41.876 --> 51:44.648
- Wow.
- A little somethin' extra in there.

51:45.688 --> 51:47.349
Fuck me, Barry!

51:50.831 --> 51:51.892

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:18.466
I'm sorry, are you working
for the fucking DEA now?

01:07:19.406 --> 01:07:20.567
Interesting read.

01:07:28.021 --> 01:07:29.342

<i>That's right. Nicaragua.</i>

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:04.944
- Is everything okay here?
- Yes, we're late.

01:08:05.484 --> 01:08:07.476
We're going to meet Sr. Vaughan.

01:08:07.556 --> 01:08:09.487
He's the Minister of Interiors.

01:08:09.517 --> 01:08:11.358
Controls the airstrips.

Yeah, I'm gonna get home...

01:11:05.677 --> 01:11:08.668
Right now. I'm gonna leave.
Then uh, we'll figure it out.

01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:10.479
I'll figure it out.

01:11:16.693 --> 01:11:19.455

01:11:24.638 --> 01:11:27.631
I got two fucking priors, man.
And he doesn't understand.

01:11:27.641 --> 01:11:29.672
No, no, no.
He does understand.

01:11:30.442 --> 01:11:31.843
And you gotta do
what he tells you to do.

01:11:31.848 --> 01:11:33.344
<i>No, he doesn't, man.</i>

01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:36.546

01:11:37.757 --> 01:11:39.658

Barry?
Barry, are you there?

<i>Yeah, I know that, amigo. Listen,

01:12:03.563 --> 01:12:04.633

<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:12:04.673 --> 01:12:06.735
<i>There's some people
that wanna talk to me.</i>

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:11.507
No, no no. You don't talk to
anyone about anything.

01:12:11.547 --> 01:12:13.038
<i>Now, you do what that
lawyer tells you to.</i>

01:12:13.043 --> 01:12:14.539
<i>And you keep your

01:12:14.549 --> 01:12:16.751
<i>- I'm taking care of this.</i>
- Okay.

01:12:19.592 --> 01:12:22.684
Listen, Jorge, we gotta put on
the brakes for a bit.

01:12:22.784 --> 01:12:25.386
Brakes? No, no, no.
No brakes.

01:12:25.391 --> 01:12:26.486
<i>We have product to move.</i>

01:12:26.491 --> 01:12:28.668
I understand <i>amigo</i>,
but I-I got a family situation.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.669
<i>Eh, your brother-in-law.
We know all about it.</i>

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:34.552
<i>- We'll handle it, amigo.</i>
- No, no, no, no.

01:12:34.557 --> 01:12:37.754
- I don't want you to handle it.
<i>- Barry, listen.</i>

01:12:37.784 --> 01:12:40.626
- I got it. I got this.
- Barry, listen to me.

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:44.598
We'll handle it, okay?
So don't worry.

01:12:44.603 --> 01:12:46.699
<i>- We'll talk business later.</i>
- Jorge...

01:13:15.747 --> 01:13:18.719
Barry, they don-they don't know
about them suitcases you got.

01:13:18.759 --> 01:13:20.260
or what you got in them planes,
the guns you got.

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:22.561
They don't know anything about it.

01:13:22.566 --> 01:13:23.692
We're good, man.

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.564
I can't fix this.
You hear?

01:13:26.764 --> 01:13:31.607
They're gonna give you 10-
10 years for not talkin'.

01:13:31.647 --> 01:13:33.738
That's 10 years people
gotta worry you will.

01:13:33.778 --> 01:13:35.629
I didn't say anything, man.

01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:37.651
You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.

01:13:41.564 --> 01:13:42.754
Where we going, man?

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:50.639
You serious?
I'm fucking family.

01:13:54.611 --> 01:13:55.772
We're family!

01:13:58.784 --> 01:14:02.696
That's right. Right.
We're a family.

01:14:04.697 --> 01:14:07.689
- What's that?
- Inside's a passport...

01:14:07.699 --> 01:14:10.672
first-class ticket to
Bora Bora and enough cash...

01:14:10.842 --> 01:14:13.673
Enough cash to make
a damn good life for yourself.

01:14:14.719 --> 01:14:15.855
Now, you're gonna
get in that car,

01:14:15.865 --> 01:14:20.561
and you're gonna drive straight
to Dallas Fort Worth Airport

01:14:20.567 --> 01:14:22.319
and nowhere else.

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:25.821
You don't even
stop to take a piss.

01:14:25.831 --> 01:14:28.802
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

01:14:32.605 --> 01:14:33.805
Good luck, kid.

01:14:44.693 --> 01:14:46.664
I'll tell you what, Barry.

01:14:46.694 --> 01:14:49.636
I'm gonna send you a
goddamn address, okay, Barry?

01:14:49.641 --> 01:14:52.757
You're gonna start sending
me cash on the fucking regular.

01:14:52.762 --> 01:14:55.639
You understand?
You hear me?

01:15:03.694 --> 01:15:05.665
Oh, and Barry...

What?
Oh, shit.

01:16:14.808 --> 01:16:16.779
Hey, hey! Barry!

01:16:30.928 --> 01:16:32.729

Yeah, Bill, what do you need?
What do you need?

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.063
Man, man, I'm like
freakin' out, man.

01:16:38.068 --> 01:16:39.874
What is goin' on with JB?

01:16:40.844 --> 01:16:43.876
- Huh?
- Don't worry about JB.

01:16:43.886 --> 01:16:45.827
What if he talks, man?

01:16:45.832 --> 01:16:49.689
- He ain't gonna.
- Yeah, but what if he does?

01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:53.763
- He ain't gonna talk, Bill.
- How do you know?

01:16:53.803 --> 01:16:56.865
I am fucking positive.

01:17:01.687 --> 01:17:02.948
Okay, man.

01:17:02.953 --> 01:17:05.720
Good, I'm gonna trust
you on this one, man.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.921
Good.

01:17:13.765 --> 01:17:16.166
<i>In calendar year, your
operations have transported</i>

01:17:16.171 --> 01:17:18.868

01:17:18.873 --> 01:17:19.968
Yeah.

01:17:19.973 --> 01:17:24.022
5,000 of which, have found
themselves in the hands

01:17:24.027 --> 01:17:25.688
of the Colombian Cartel.

01:17:25.693 --> 01:17:28.214
- Right, but...
- Out of the 916 Contras

01:17:28.219 --> 01:17:30.826
brought in to the
United States to train,

01:17:30.831 --> 01:17:32.827
only half made it back
to Nicaragua.

01:17:32.832 --> 01:17:35.959
- Half is...
- The other half are in the wild...

01:18:00.714 --> 01:18:02.735
What's going on here?

01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:06.748
Oh, yeah. We had to send
the Contras home.

01:18:06.788 --> 01:18:08.989
- Home?
- Yeah.

01:18:09.294 --> 01:18:11.080
They weren't fighting.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.902
That's the reality
of that situation.

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:19.795
You know, it didn't help that
their guns were in Colombia.

01:18:19.805 --> 01:18:21.236
Did it, Barry?

01:18:31.864 --> 01:18:34.735

Who the fuck's Schafer?

01:18:56.838 --> 01:18:59.841
Okay, everybody.
You know the drill.

01:18:59.846 --> 01:19:01.332
Everybody gets a burn bag.

01:19:01.342 --> 01:19:03.873

01:19:03.883 --> 01:19:05.945
or name on it.

01:19:08.826 --> 01:19:10.387
Come on, boys.
We gotta move.

01:19:10.587 --> 01:19:12.989
We gotta get all this
stuff outta here.

01:19:13.029 --> 01:19:16.711
- Pete. What, everything?
- Come on, boys, lets go.

01:19:16.721 --> 01:19:18.802
We gotta move this out.
Let's go! Let's go!

01:19:18.807 --> 01:19:20.903
Into the burn bag, go!

01:19:20.908 --> 01:19:23.945
Purchase orders,
aircraft invoices,

01:19:27.397 --> 01:19:29.809
Oh, shit, man.
Look at all these guns.

01:19:29.819 --> 01:19:31.261
We gotta move all of it.

01:19:31.461 --> 01:19:32.761
Where are we supposed
to put all this stuff?

01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:33.952
Just get it off my property.

01:19:33.962 --> 01:19:35.903
Anything with the words "Mena".

01:19:35.908 --> 01:19:41.847
Fuel bills, memos, names,
directives, photos, anything like that,

01:19:41.852 --> 01:19:43.838
anything that can link us with him,
you put in the burn bag...

01:19:43.878 --> 01:19:45.939
and then what do you do with it?

01:19:45.944 --> 01:19:47.400
- Burn it.
- You burn it.

01:19:48.005 --> 01:19:49.912
Bob, I need a little help
back here.

01:19:49.922 --> 01:19:52.953
- Gimme a hand with this shit.
- You got it.

01:19:55.995 --> 01:20:00.038
Seal! DEA! Back away from the truck,
with your hands in the air.

01:20:00.043 --> 01:20:02.029
Drop the fucking box, shithead!

01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:04.471
Put up your hands!
Nice and high.

01:20:06.042 --> 01:20:08.784
- ATF! Drop your weapons!
- What the fuck?

01:20:08.789 --> 01:20:11.315
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! DEA!
- Lower your guns!

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:13.076
Put your freaking guns down!

01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:14.957
- Everybody's friends here!
- It's cool.

01:20:14.962 --> 01:20:17.519
- DEA, all right?
- This is our collar.

01:20:17.524 --> 01:20:20.771

He says it's urgent.

01:21:57.131 --> 01:21:58.922
It's...the Governor.

01:22:00.062 --> 01:22:02.123
It's the Governor.

01:22:03.034 --> 01:22:06.036
Put him through. Clear the room.
Take him with you.

01:22:06.076 --> 01:22:10.108

01:22:11.094 --> 01:22:12.511
that Caddies have more trunk space

01:22:12.516 --> 01:22:14.152

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:16.983
I'll give each and
every one of you a Caddy.

01:22:18.024 --> 01:22:20.815

01:22:21.016 --> 01:22:22.016
Yes, sir, I would.

I'd get all ya'll Caddies.
Have 'em here this afternoon.

01:22:24.783 --> 01:22:27.034

Add another 20 for bribery?

01:22:27.039 --> 01:22:28.980
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just offerin'
you Caddies for your troubles.

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.881

You have one here in a bag.

01:26:28.579 --> 01:26:31.011
The sightline goes
straight down the back

01:26:31.016 --> 01:26:32.552
to where those
two gentlemen are now.

01:26:33.192 --> 01:26:35.934

Sightlines directly

01:26:43.588 --> 01:26:45.059
Each camera has a cord.

01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:48.531
You just press this button

01:26:59.628 --> 01:27:01.079
Yeah.

01:27:03.991 --> 01:27:05.682
I can see this damn cord

01:27:05.883 --> 01:27:07.534
which means they're
gonna be able to see it.

01:27:08.534 --> 01:27:10.695

- I'm not a photographer.

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:12.106

01:27:33.734 --> 01:27:37.002
They're gonna be classified

- Classified.

01:27:41.114 --> 01:27:44.957

No, you don't.

01:27:51.130 --> 01:27:53.061

They gonna cut us up
in little pieces.
