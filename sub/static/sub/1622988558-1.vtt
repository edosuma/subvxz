WEBVTT

00:01.216 --> 00:03.854
(deep breaths)

00:06.160 --> 00:07.862
I've never been coddled,
swaddled or fondled.

00:07.896 --> 00:09.132
I've never been coddled,
swaddled, or fondled...

00:09.166 --> 00:10.768
Ay, bro, they said they
ready for you.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.205
Come on, it's his routine.
Let him do it.

00:12.238 --> 00:13.941
I take it back, what?
I take it back. Okay. Okay.

00:13.974 --> 00:15.344
Don't be nervous, Dave,
everything's gonna be

00:15.378 --> 00:17.148
exactly how it should be
because that's what you do.

00:17.182 --> 00:18.951
I'm Maria Manzano,
Channel 9 News, back to Dave.

00:18.984 --> 00:20.621
That part's a little icky,
racially.

00:20.655 --> 00:22.959
‐Thank you, Maria.
Thank you, Maria.
‐(knock on door)

00:22.992 --> 00:25.098
Fuck it.
Let's just go.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.002
(sighs)

00:28.037 --> 00:30.041
Hey, you know it ain't nothing
to be nervous about, right?

00:30.074 --> 00:32.145
This is big tycoon status
shit right here, man.

00:32.178 --> 00:33.748
He's not nervous.
Stop saying that.

00:33.781 --> 00:35.885
‐How can he not be nervous?
‐He's not.

00:35.918 --> 00:38.022
He's ready, he's anxious.
He's excited.

00:38.057 --> 00:39.626
Don't be nervous, David, okay?

00:39.659 --> 00:41.196
Millions of people are
about to be introduced to you

00:41.230 --> 00:42.899
for the first time;
this is exciting.

00:42.932 --> 00:45.037
‐You're making it worse.
‐Okay.

00:45.071 --> 00:46.206
It's just like riding
a bike, though.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.043
It's muscle memory.
At this point,

00:48.077 --> 00:49.780
you've done this thousands of
times, I mean, come on.

00:49.813 --> 00:50.648
Nobody in my family
is ever going to die.

00:50.681 --> 00:51.950
It's a fact.

00:51.984 --> 00:53.788
Nobody in my family
is ever going to die.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.894
It's a fact. Ha.
No one's gonna die.

00:59.132 --> 01:00.935
‐I love you, Bubba.
You're gonna be great.
‐Shut up.

01:00.968 --> 01:04.042
(announcer speaks indistinctly
over P. A.)

01:04.075 --> 01:06.079
(applause)

01:12.692 --> 01:14.930
(speaking Korean)

01:25.051 --> 01:26.353
Korea...

01:26.386 --> 01:28.324
(speaking Korean)

01:30.394 --> 01:31.930
(weak applause)

01:31.964 --> 01:33.834
Korean Music Awards.
Let's go!

01:33.868 --> 01:36.073
(weak applause)

01:37.408 --> 01:39.846
And we got BTS in the house.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.717
(loud cheers and applause)

01:41.750 --> 01:43.988
There's no BTS.

01:45.725 --> 01:47.228
Huh?

01:48.397 --> 01:50.234
That...

01:50.268 --> 01:53.174
(whispering):
Keep going, please.

01:53.207 --> 01:54.376
(nervous laugh)

01:54.409 --> 01:56.446
What the fuck just happened?

01:56.480 --> 01:58.918
‐Man, that shit was hard.
‐I don't think it was.

01:58.951 --> 02:00.388
The feed didn't even show
the whole thing.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.757
‐You're fine.
‐It wasn't on TV?

02:01.790 --> 02:03.127
‐No, you're good.
‐Oh, my God.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.131
‐What is this?
‐It's bulgogi, japchae...

02:05.164 --> 02:07.101
‐What time is it, Dan?
‐It's 8:00 p. m.

02:07.135 --> 02:09.372
‐No, it's not.
‐Uh, yes, it is.

02:09.406 --> 02:11.243
No, it's not, we're on
American time, album mode.

02:11.276 --> 02:13.247
‐No jet lag, Dan.
‐I thought that was a joke.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.184
Dan, it's 4:00 a. m.
my time right now

02:15.218 --> 02:16.920
and you're judging me.
That's a joke.

02:16.954 --> 02:18.190
‐Okay?
‐Don't trip, bro.

02:18.224 --> 02:19.926
You can get us some more
weed, intern?

02:19.960 --> 02:21.396
This shit I gandered in
ain't gonna last us, bro.

02:21.430 --> 02:22.732
Uh, o‐okay.

02:22.765 --> 02:24.336
Dave, you want your backpack?

02:24.369 --> 02:26.273
‐I prefer you keep it on you.
‐Okay, yeah. Sure.

02:26.306 --> 02:27.909
Please stop presenting me
with the food.

02:27.942 --> 02:29.179
‐I'm trying to work on my body.
‐Oh, okay.

02:29.212 --> 02:31.950
Dave, we want to‐‐
Hey, I‐I want to eat it.

02:31.984 --> 02:34.155
‐Uh, you hold it.
‐Oh.

02:34.189 --> 02:35.324
Uh, big news. CL. We've got
five minutes of her time

02:35.358 --> 02:37.027
down by the loading dock
if you want to

02:37.061 --> 02:38.397
‐talk to her about tomorrow.
‐If I want to.

02:38.430 --> 02:40.000
No, I'm just gonna wing
the first video

02:40.034 --> 02:41.403
for my first single
off my first album.

02:41.436 --> 02:43.173
Okay, well, use that charm
on her, all right?

02:43.207 --> 02:44.943
‐Let's go talk to her.
‐Okay.

02:44.976 --> 02:47.348
Who is CL? What does CL stand
for, Corean Lady?

02:47.382 --> 02:49.819
‐I'm just joking.
‐Have some fucking respect,
Gata.

02:49.853 --> 02:51.223
Chae‐rin Lee.
She's a Korean pop star.

02:51.256 --> 02:53.494
When you're big out here,
you get every stream.

02:53.527 --> 02:55.765
Honestly, CL, I could not have
asked for a better guest first.

02:55.798 --> 02:57.035
‐You killed it.
‐Thank you.

02:57.068 --> 02:59.039
Change your name to CW,
because...

02:59.072 --> 03:00.374
(man speaks Korean)

03:00.408 --> 03:03.781
...I don't see any L's
the way I'm looking.

03:03.814 --> 03:05.851
Do you know when the song
is coming out?

03:05.885 --> 03:07.255
Uh, as soon as me and you make

03:07.288 --> 03:08.991
the best music video
of all time tomorrow.

03:09.024 --> 03:11.330
Uh, by the way, I did do
some tweaks to the beat

03:11.363 --> 03:13.500
and a few lyrics,
so now I added a drop.

03:13.534 --> 03:15.438
‐Okay.
‐'Cause I want it to go crazy
a festivals.

03:15.471 --> 03:16.940
‐Yeah, yeah, sure.
‐You know?
This is a global song.

03:16.974 --> 03:19.946
So I, it's...

03:22.385 --> 03:25.458
♪ I just woke up in Korea... ♪

03:25.491 --> 03:26.960

03:26.994 --> 03:28.364
Oh, I can't believe this.

03:28.397 --> 03:31.069
My one day off
just got fully booked.

03:31.103 --> 03:32.805
This is crazy.
I can't live like this.

03:32.839 --> 03:35.811
Have you ever read
the Calvin and Hobbes book

03:35.845 --> 03:37.248
The Days Are Just Packed?

03:37.282 --> 03:38.951
Hmm?

03:38.984 --> 03:40.988
Ah, Gata, I don't know if I can
do another 16‐hour flight.

03:41.022 --> 03:42.358
My back is killing me, man.

03:42.392 --> 03:44.229
Bro, you gotta keep
the steak sizzling, nigga.

03:44.262 --> 03:45.498
Some things just must be done.

03:45.531 --> 03:47.201
Or I gotta stretch more.

03:47.235 --> 03:49.806
Look at CL's manager.
Look at how he squats.

03:49.839 --> 03:51.343
He gets so low to the ground,
it's like his butthole

03:51.376 --> 03:52.512
can touch the earth.

03:52.545 --> 03:54.416
Why you watching
another man squat?

03:54.449 --> 03:55.885
Because I'm impressed.

03:55.918 --> 03:57.055
You talking about
how low he getting?

03:57.088 --> 03:59.024
‐Yeah, that's impressive.
‐You about to blow my high, bro.

03:59.059 --> 04:00.227
I'm about to bend the corner
and get faded, bro.

04:00.261 --> 04:02.465
You always sayin' some
funny shit, bro.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.137
CL:
You know what, you're lucky
your finishing

04:05.171 --> 04:06.974
your album right now,
'cause that's the only time

04:07.007 --> 04:11.183
I ever get to be in one place
all by myself.

04:11.216 --> 04:13.854
I mean, for me, making an album
has been, like,

04:13.887 --> 04:15.524
psychological, uh, chaos.

04:15.558 --> 04:18.364
You know, you only get one
first impression, and this is

04:18.397 --> 04:20.234
my debut, so it's like
it's got to be so smart,

04:20.267 --> 04:22.839
so good at rapping,
so poignant,

04:22.872 --> 04:23.974
like, so reinventive.

04:24.008 --> 04:25.845
So‐‐ So play me something.

04:25.878 --> 04:27.915
Not my thing.

04:27.949 --> 04:30.388
You know, I wouldn't even play
anything for Obama, who's...

04:30.421 --> 04:33.026
Come on, you have to play it
for your management

04:33.060 --> 04:34.262
or your label.

04:34.295 --> 04:36.199
(chuckles):
Those people are actually

04:36.233 --> 04:37.869
the last people
on the face of the Earth

04:37.902 --> 04:40.006
‐I would ever play my music for.
‐Buddy, what up?
‐Oh.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.178
Time to go. It's way too late.

04:42.211 --> 04:44.416
Jae, did you know about
this change?

04:44.449 --> 04:47.889
‐I needed a day off.
‐(speaking Korean)

04:55.204 --> 04:58.009
I'm so out of the loop...

04:58.043 --> 04:59.946
...on the language.
Can I get a selfie?

04:59.979 --> 05:01.316
Make it quick, please.

05:01.350 --> 05:04.556
‐Okay.
‐She needs her rest.

05:04.589 --> 05:07.428
Wow. Okay. Uh...

05:07.462 --> 05:09.032
All right.

05:09.065 --> 05:11.636

Iconic.

‐Okay, gotta go.

05:16.346 --> 05:18.917

‐Bye, Dave.

05:18.951 --> 05:21.456

‐Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.

Iron woman, nigga. That's crazy.

That's crazy.

Beyoncé, nigga.

Oh. Sorry about your uncle.

‐He's not as funny
as I thought he'd be.
‐Yeah, man.

07:31.149 --> 07:32.585
I mean, I love the guy,
but you know,

07:32.618 --> 07:34.255
he's putting the finishing
touches on his album,

getting our taste, too.

07:42.205 --> 07:44.642
He, Dan, how many Black people
in Korea, bro?

07:44.676 --> 07:46.313
I need to know the answer.

07:46.346 --> 07:48.717
Uh, I'm not sure.
I‐I was born here,

07:48.750 --> 07:50.187
but I grew up in Pomona.

07:50.221 --> 07:52.058
And I bet you
there's way less redheads

07:52.091 --> 07:53.627
than Black people in Korea.

07:53.660 --> 07:55.364
Here we go again.

07:55.397 --> 07:57.235
Dan, don't fall for
this shit, intern.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.505
Seriously, bro, go to sleep,
get some rest.

07:59.539 --> 08:01.343
No, it's real, though.
You know that, right, Dan?

08:01.376 --> 08:04.082
We're the only race left
that it's socially acceptable

08:04.115 --> 08:05.484
to make fun of, to dog on.

08:05.517 --> 08:07.822
You know how many gingers
have been erased from history?

08:07.855 --> 08:10.094
‐Um, no.
‐Yeah, lots.

08:10.127 --> 08:12.532
Thomas Jefferson, redhead.
George Washington, redhead.

08:12.565 --> 08:15.371
‐Santa Claus.
‐Oh, Santa.

08:15.404 --> 08:18.076
You see him with white hair.
That's how they paint him.

08:18.110 --> 08:19.345

‐Right.

08:21.516 --> 08:24.222
‐He was quite musclebound.
‐Wow.

08:24.255 --> 08:25.658
He didn't have a gut.

‐Can I go to bed now?
‐In great sh... What?

08:28.263 --> 08:29.632
Could I go to bed now?

09:36.533 --> 09:38.236

09:40.841 --> 09:43.313
you are taking a shit

Dan... (exhales)

Translate.

09:48.523 --> 09:49.792
Be algorithmic. Please.

09:49.826 --> 09:51.529
I have a real Korean man
right in front of me

09:51.563 --> 09:52.698
that I came all the way
out here for.

09:52.732 --> 09:54.202
‐Dude. Okay. Okay.
‐He's a director.

09:54.235 --> 09:55.738
‐Check.
‐And by the way, I did‐‐

09:55.771 --> 09:56.906
Just so you know, I did a lot
of research coming into this.

09:56.940 --> 09:58.210
Right, yeah.

09:58.243 --> 09:59.278
It's like, I already know

09:59.312 --> 10:00.280
that when a Korean baby's born,

10:00.314 --> 10:01.483
it's one, instantaneously.

10:01.516 --> 10:02.718
Did you know that?

10:02.752 --> 10:04.489
‐Yeah. Yeah.
‐You knew that.

10:04.522 --> 10:05.891
Did you know that 90% of
the world's consumable seaweed

10:05.924 --> 10:07.228
comes from Korea?

10:07.261 --> 10:09.265
I didn't know that. No.

10:09.298 --> 10:10.434
Hmm.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.738
(speaking Korean)

10:12.772 --> 10:14.375
No, the seaweed.

10:14.409 --> 10:15.377
‐Tell him about...
‐Oh.

10:15.411 --> 10:16.680
(speaking Korean)

10:16.713 --> 10:17.748
Could‐‐

10:17.782 --> 10:19.285
can we actually
check out the set?

10:19.318 --> 10:20.521
‐I have, I have a few notes.
‐Oh.

10:20.554 --> 10:21.956
What made you want to do
a K‐pop song?

10:21.990 --> 10:23.760
Oh, my God. How could you
not make a K‐pop song

10:23.794 --> 10:25.197
in today's era?
Are you kidding?

10:25.230 --> 10:26.232
Every single video

10:26.266 --> 10:27.268
that comes out of this country

10:27.301 --> 10:28.470
gets, like, what?

10:28.503 --> 10:30.307
Five million billion views
in a day?

10:30.341 --> 10:31.509
It's the best idea
I've ever had.

10:31.543 --> 10:32.745
It's a fucking cheat code.

10:32.778 --> 10:33.880
These fans affect, like,

10:33.914 --> 10:35.384
global elections in politics.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.321
I expect our video to get

10:37.355 --> 10:38.690
300 million views
in the first day,

10:38.724 --> 10:40.594
especially
I'm being, like, funny.

10:40.627 --> 10:42.498
Like‐‐ Being funny is gonna
be like being Elvis out here.

10:42.531 --> 10:44.569
But...
I think that's, like,

10:44.602 --> 10:46.339
‐an American tool?
‐Yeah. Aniyo.

10:46.373 --> 10:47.975
Aniyo. What?

10:48.008 --> 10:49.312
DAN:
Aniyo.

10:49.345 --> 10:50.748
‐Aniyo.
‐Yeah.

10:50.781 --> 10:52.418
Hey, can this whole thing
get, like, a little bigger?

10:52.451 --> 10:54.389
Like more circ and pompinstance?

10:54.422 --> 10:57.294
Like... I just feel like we're
really limiting the scope of...

10:57.328 --> 10:58.663
‐Big. Big.
‐Big, yes.

10:58.697 --> 11:00.634
‐Action.
‐That would be great,

11:00.667 --> 11:02.238
‐if you could do that, yeah.
‐Yes, yes.

11:02.271 --> 11:03.807
It needs, like, more scope.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.411
(speaking Korean)

11:05.444 --> 11:07.214
Oh, this is what
CL's gonna wear.

11:07.248 --> 11:08.817
Great.
This seems, like,

11:08.850 --> 11:10.988
all‐encompassing,
full‐service Asian garb, right?

11:11.021 --> 11:13.260
‐"Asian garb"?
‐Yeah, like...

11:13.293 --> 11:15.798
in the sense that it would
reach all the lands.

11:15.831 --> 11:18.703
And‐‐ 'Cause, ideally,
if I could have it my way,

11:18.737 --> 11:20.340
we would really pick off
all the nations.

11:20.374 --> 11:21.643
China, Japan,

11:21.676 --> 11:23.980
like, Iran, Persia,
Sunnis, Shiites.

11:24.014 --> 11:26.018
Everybody in the whole
fucking region,

11:26.052 --> 11:28.723
all the lands, if they could buy
into this, that would be huge.

11:28.757 --> 11:30.928
From a population and, like,
a view, like...

11:30.961 --> 11:33.300
Just the analytics.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.702
Can you just go get the ketchup

11:34.736 --> 11:36.406
‐that I asked you for? For my...
‐Yeah.

11:36.439 --> 11:37.675
Thank you.

11:37.708 --> 11:38.877
‐My packets are in my backpack.
‐Yeah.

11:38.910 --> 11:40.447
Where is my backpack,
by the way?

11:40.481 --> 11:41.850
‐Um...
‐I thought it was always

11:41.883 --> 11:42.918
‐supposed to be
on your body, Dan.
‐Sorry.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.020
Oh, my God.

11:44.055 --> 11:45.491
‐Okay?
‐Yeah, yeah. Good.

11:45.524 --> 11:46.993
‐Oh, okay.
‐Hey, Mike, where is she?

11:47.026 --> 11:48.563
I don't know.

11:48.597 --> 11:49.465
I've left her manager,
like, four voice mails.

11:49.499 --> 11:50.734
This is insane.

11:50.768 --> 11:52.738
No ETA?
We have no idea where she is?

11:52.772 --> 11:54.342
I have no idea.
I can't get ahold of anybody.

11:54.375 --> 11:55.611
We have to start shooting
her scenes,

11:55.644 --> 11:57.348
otherwise we're gonna be
going into overtime.

11:57.381 --> 11:58.850
‐Like, now.
‐Okay, can you control
your stress?

11:58.884 --> 12:00.454
Because when you get stressed,
I get stressed.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.656
I am controlling.
This is me controlling

12:01.689 --> 12:02.992
‐my stress.
‐Really? That's crazy.

12:03.025 --> 12:04.595
‐Thank you. I'll do my job.
‐DAVE: Thank you.

12:04.629 --> 12:05.664
Gata, do you have
any more of that weed?

12:05.697 --> 12:07.268
‐I'd love to smoke.
‐Bro,

12:07.301 --> 12:08.670
they big trippin' out here.
I tried smokin' earlier.

12:08.703 --> 12:09.872
Bro, they flipped out
on me, bro.

12:09.906 --> 12:10.774
This is not L. A.

12:10.808 --> 12:12.845
This shit's super illegal
out here, bro.

12:12.878 --> 12:14.949
But thank God I got to blow some
last night by the car, man.

12:16.453 --> 12:17.922
By the car?

12:17.955 --> 12:19.559
Wait.

12:19.592 --> 12:21.529
GATA: I'm blowing bud
regardless, nigga. Fuck 12.

Hey, hey. We talked about that.

12:22.998 --> 12:24.368
No "fuck 12."

12:24.402 --> 12:25.871
‐Just "some 12."
‐GATA: Yeah, that's true.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.443

Whoa.

12:28.477 --> 12:29.445
She can't be
in a picture with weed.

12:29.479 --> 12:31.449
You got to delete that.

12:31.483 --> 12:33.086
Why wouldn't you warn me
about this?

12:33.119 --> 12:34.522
I didn't know you posted it.

12:34.555 --> 12:37.328
You don't follow me?

12:37.361 --> 12:38.597
No, I‐I didn't.

12:38.630 --> 12:39.765
It keeps going to voice mail.

12:39.799 --> 12:41.970
Okay? So...
What do we do now?

12:42.003 --> 12:43.507
Well, I think it's 'cause

12:43.540 --> 12:44.342
she's in this fucking picture
with Weed Man.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.410
No. Weed's not‐‐

Kind of is, yeah.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.053
‐MIKE: Okay.
‐Fuck!

12:50.087 --> 12:51.723
What if we‐‐ Can we shoot this
without her? Is that even...

12:51.756 --> 12:53.393
Without her?
She's a Korean pop artist.

12:53.426 --> 12:55.898
You can't do a K‐pop song
without a K‐pop artist. Like...

12:55.931 --> 12:57.668
‐MIKE: Okay...
‐We leave tomorrow.

12:57.701 --> 12:58.737
MIKE:
Okay, I understand
we leave tomorrow.

All right? Well, our budget's

‐Yeah.

13:02.611 --> 13:03.847
for them to just come
and hope it happens, okay?

13:03.880 --> 13:05.784
We have to, like,
proactively go to them.

13:05.817 --> 13:08.623
So, find an address of where
her manager works or something.

13:08.657 --> 13:09.725
You want to go to the office?

13:09.759 --> 13:11.095
I want to do something

13:11.129 --> 13:12.665
so we can maybe fucking
salvage this thing.

13:12.698 --> 13:13.767
‐Okay, I'll find the...
‐Yeah, let's go.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.070

‐Please.

we're going. Yeah. Let's go.

13:16.439 --> 13:17.942
W‐Wait, should I come?

Apparently, like,

25:56.458 --> 25:59.231
You heard‐‐
you heard everything?

25:59.264 --> 26:01.101
‐Yes.
‐Okay, um,

26:01.135 --> 26:04.174
he told me about this article
that was titled

26:04.207 --> 26:05.576
"The Dark Side of K‐pop."

26:05.610 --> 26:07.580
I'll let him tell you about...

26:07.614 --> 26:09.384
Yeah, I just,
I‐I Cliffs Notes it.

26:09.418 --> 26:10.820
I think I didn't
finish it and it's‐‐

26:10.853 --> 26:13.559
I think it's from 2016, it's‐‐
I think it was old, so...

26:13.592 --> 26:15.196
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

26:15.229 --> 26:17.701
So you come out here to
leech off of K‐pop's success

26:17.734 --> 26:20.707
‐for your own good,
you're late...
‐No, no. No.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.310
...and you blamed that on me.

26:22.344 --> 26:23.612
‐Mm.
‐Well...
‐You broke the law,

26:23.646 --> 26:27.854
and you thought I was
committing suicide?

26:27.887 --> 26:29.691
‐Uh...
‐Yes.

26:29.725 --> 26:32.430
‐That's a concise summary of
what happened, but...
‐Yeah.

26:32.464 --> 26:34.801
Here's the deal.
Your manager was being really

26:34.835 --> 26:37.574
kind of rude to you
and there was a tenseness...

26:37.607 --> 26:40.313
First of all,
this is my head of security.

26:40.346 --> 26:41.715
‐Oh.
‐And the reason I was tense...

26:41.749 --> 26:43.686
‐No. Don't do that.
‐...was because

26:43.719 --> 26:46.425
I don't want any of you guys
wasting my time.

26:46.458 --> 26:47.761
I love K‐pop.

26:47.794 --> 26:50.633
I don't want to be a part
of you disrespecting it.

26:50.667 --> 26:53.839
No, I'm not disrespecting it.
I think I love K‐pop, too.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.476
So let's make this video

26:55.510 --> 26:57.447
‐together, please...
‐You know what?

26:57.480 --> 27:00.753
You fucked up... in Korea.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.357
Annyeong.

27:02.390 --> 27:04.361
‐MIKE: What's‐‐ What...?
‐Annyeong.

27:04.394 --> 27:07.834
I'm not married to anything
creatively. We could change it.

27:07.867 --> 27:09.871
CL:
Whatever!

27:10.907 --> 27:13.212
