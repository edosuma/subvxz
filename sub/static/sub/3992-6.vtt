00:01.530 --> 00:03.168
- Previously on Hannibal...

00:03.200 --> 00:06.294
- Do not discuss me
with Hannibal Lecter.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.490
- I brought Gideon back
because I thought he may be

00:08.540 --> 00:10.758
useful in Will Graham's therapy.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.268
- I'm going to give you a chance
to save Will from himself.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.301
- Who does he want
to kill, Doctor?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.443
- I want you to kill
Hannibal Lecter.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.143
- (Hannibal): Will Graham is
not a murderer. He asked you
to do this.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.612
(gunshot)

00:23.650 --> 00:26.084
- (Jack): Get an ambulance!

00:26.120 --> 00:28.554
(harpsichord music)

01:24.280 --> 01:27.579
- You're moving smoothly
and slowly, Jack.

01:27.620 --> 01:32.353
Carrying your concentration
like a brimming cup.

01:32.390 --> 01:35.154
- Hannibal Lecter was
almost murdered...

01:37.560 --> 01:40.154
...by an employee
of this hospital.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.169
An attendant

01:43.200 --> 01:46.761
who we believe is
the person that...

01:46.800 --> 01:49.837
killed the bailiff and the judge
at your murder trial.

01:49.870 --> 01:52.600
- He killed the bailiff;
he didn't kill the judge.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.745
- He told me.

01:58.780 --> 02:01.271
- Then you told him
to kill Hannibal.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.438
- Nothing I said
made that happen, Jack.

02:05.490 --> 02:08.186
It just happened.

02:08.220 --> 02:11.883
- It just happened.

02:11.930 --> 02:14.251
You don't seem to be
too broken up about it.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.667
- There's a common_ emotion
we all recognize

02:17.700 --> 02:19.759
and have not yet named.

02:21.770 --> 02:26.537
The happy anticipation of being
able to feel contempt.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.208
- You feel contempt
for Hannibal?

02:29.250 --> 02:32.640
- Well, I have contempt for
the Ripper. I have contempt
for what he does.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.148
- And what does he do?
- What does he do?

02:36.950 --> 02:39.919
What is the first and principal
thing he does?

02:39.960 --> 02:43.748
What need does he serve
by killing?

02:43.790 --> 02:47.396
- He harvests organs.
- No, that's only

02:47.430 --> 02:50.263
the action of what he does.
Why does he need to do it?

02:50.300 --> 02:55.237
The Ripper kills in sounders
of three or four in quick order.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.639
Do you know why?

03:00.880 --> 03:02.438
I know why.

03:08.780 --> 03:10.645
- Then tell me.

03:10.690 --> 03:15.889
- Because if he waits too long,
then the meat spoils.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.356
- He's eating them?

03:19.400 --> 03:22.619
Hannibal is like Garrett
Jacob Hobbs? A cannibal?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.763
- No, not like
Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.961
Hobbs ate his victims
to honor them;

03:27.000 --> 03:30.629
the Ripper eats his victims
because they're no better
to him than pigs.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.801
- With the exception
of Beverly Katz, there is no

03:34.840 --> 03:37.673
connection between Hannibal
and any Ripper Victims.

03:37.710 --> 03:39.746
- No immediate connection.

03:39.780 --> 03:44.444
- Hannibal Lecter is not
the Chesapeake Ripper.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.014
- If the Ripper's killing,

03:46.050 --> 03:48.655
you can bet Hannibal Lecter's
planning a dinner party.

03:48.690 --> 03:52.694
You and I probably sipped wine
while swallowing the people

03:52.730 --> 03:55.324
to whom we were trying
to give justice, Jack.

04:01.540 --> 04:05.260
Who does he have to kill
before you open your eyes?

04:09.680 --> 04:13.719
- A remarkably lean organ,
the heart, yet such a potent

04:13.750 --> 04:15.911
symbol of life...

04:15.950 --> 04:19.317
and the things
that make us human -

04:19.360 --> 04:20.713
good and bad,

04:20.760 --> 04:23.524
love and ache.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.723
- All of them skewered.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.728
- It's a thematic dish.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.728
(piano music playing)

04:30.770 --> 04:32.988
My heart certainly
feels skewered.

04:35.370 --> 04:38.601
- You have the scars
to prove it.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.803
- It feels as if that noose is
still around my neck.

04:43.810 --> 04:47.519
Strange having nightmares;
I never used to.

04:47.550 --> 04:51.839
- Don't make the same
mistake I've made -

04:51.890 --> 04:54.916
being your own
psychiatrist.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.659
I'm always assessing my feelings
instead of acting on them.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.760
- It's the safest course.

05:04.770 --> 05:07.534
- You have to find a way to deal
with what happened to you.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.502
- I'm metabolizing
the experience

05:12.540 --> 05:14.701
by composing
a new piece of music.

05:18.650 --> 05:20.618
- Harpsichord
or theremin?

05:20.650 --> 05:22.447
- Harpsichord.

05:22.490 --> 05:26.381
Stravinsky said
a true composer

05:26.420 --> 05:29.389
thinks about his unfinished work
the whole time.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.854
He's not always conscious
of this, but he's aware of it

05:32.900 --> 05:34.856
when he suddenly knows
what to do.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.629
- And do you know what to do?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.991
- I need to get
my appetite back.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.372
***

06:48.800 --> 06:51.837
(siren)

07:00.820 --> 07:02.173
- What do we got?

07:02.220 --> 07:05.712
- He's literally grafted
in place. These are

07:05.750 --> 07:09.186
living roots.
- He's got varicose vines.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.654
Threaded through, uh,
from his heels,

07:11.690 --> 07:15.990
under his legs, his back,
through his torso, out
his fingertips.

07:16.030 --> 07:19.864
Followed some pretty triclq
endoscopic surgical paths.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.460
- Chesapeake Ripper usually
cherry-picks his organs.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.559
He took almost all of them;
everything but the lungs.

07:29.980 --> 07:34.679
- The time that he devotes
to his work...

07:34.720 --> 07:37.644
He really takes pride.

07:37.690 --> 07:40.682
Belladonna for the heart.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.927
Chain of white oleander
for the intestines.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.825
Ragwort for the liver.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.021
- These flowers are
all p0isonous.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.153
- Yes. This is a judgment.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.089
The Ripper believes
that his victim was...

07:52.130 --> 07:56.669
toxic somehow,
a poisonous man.

07:56.710 --> 08:00.134
He's so damn certain
he makes me Sick.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.248
There is a pattern

08:14.290 --> 08:15.917
taking shape.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.623
I just have to convince my eyes
to see it.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.890
- I've convinced myself

08:21.930 --> 08:24.990
of something I had refused
to see for a long time.

08:25.030 --> 08:28.932
- And it only took Will Graham
trying to kill you to see it?

08:28.970 --> 08:30.665
- Yes.

08:30.710 --> 08:34.202
I can't help Will.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.969
I can't trust him.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.078
He's in a dark place
where the shadows move

08:41.120 --> 08:43.816
and it's not safe
to stand with him anymore.

08:43.850 --> 08:45.715
- I feel the same way.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.028
We, um...

08:51.060 --> 08:53.790
(clearing his throat)
...found another

08:53.830 --> 08:56.719
Ripper victim--
- I'm sorry, Jack. I can't.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.338
Not only do I have to
let Will go;

09:01.370 --> 09:03.565
I have to
let this all go.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.203
I nearly died.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.879
I would have,
if it weren't for you.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.145
I'm sorry,

09:15.180 --> 09:17.341
but I can't dwell
on death anymore.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.346
- I don't blame you.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.278
- We both have to transform

09:21.320 --> 09:24.255
_ _our misfortunes
into life-enhancmg events.

09:26.260 --> 09:30.868
- Well, when you figure out
how to do that, do let me know.

09:32.870 --> 09:35.134
- I'm going to start
by hosting a dinner party.

09:39.210 --> 09:41.303
And please tell me
you'll come.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.240
- I wouldn't miss it.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.271
(glasses touching)

09:50.290 --> 09:53.179
- (Will): You should've
let him die.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.257
- Shoulda, coulda, woulda.

09:58.260 --> 10:01.991
- He's gonna kill you,
you know.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.225
- Can't get me in here.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.990
- No, here is exactly
where he'll get you, Abel.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.134
The moment I convinced
the chief of staff to put you

10:11.170 --> 10:15.778
in a cell next to me, you were
stamped with an expiration date.

10:15.810 --> 10:20.213
Anyone who gets too close
gets got.

10:20.250 --> 10:26.314
He's the devil,
remember? Smoke.

10:26.350 --> 10:30.650
I'd be very nervous
ifI was Dr. Chilton.

10:30.690 --> 10:33.022
He's getting close too.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.119
The only way
you and Frederick are gonna

10:35.160 --> 10:37.321
get out of this alive
is if the Chesapeake

10:37.370 --> 10:39.964
Ripper is stopped.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.401
Hannibal Lecter deserves
to die.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.364
- You didn't bring me here to
help you kill Hannibal Lecter.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.970
- No, I didn't; I brought you
here to bear witness.

10:49.010 --> 10:51.945
- To tell Jack Crawford
that I sat

10:51.980 --> 10:55.416
in Hannibal Lecter's
cobalt-blue dining room,

10:55.450 --> 10:57.987
an ostentatious
herb garden

10:58.020 --> 11:02.013
with Leda and the Swan
over the fireplace and you
having a fit in the corner.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.255
That's where I asked him
if he was the Chesapeake Ripper,

11:04.290 --> 11:08.351
and he avoided the question and
suggested I kill Alana Bloom.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.722
- Yes.

11:11.770 --> 11:13.328
Tell Jack that.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.793
- I'll tell Jack Crawford
everything

11:15.840 --> 11:18.707
if you tell me
why Hannibal did it.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.744
- Because he wanted to see
what would happen.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.889
- That's where I asked him
if he was the Chesapeake Ripper

11:31.920 --> 11:36.084
and he avoided the question and
suggested I kill Alana Bloom.

11:38.260 --> 11:40.922
- Abel Gideon is a lunatic.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.497
- He is psychotic,

11:43.530 --> 11:45.498
not psychic.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.498
- We know that Gideon has

11:47.540 --> 11:50.464
a history of being
susceptible to suggestion.

11:50.510 --> 11:55.106
- The simplest explanation
as to why he can describe
Hannibal Lecter's home

11:55.140 --> 11:57.370
is that he was
in Hannibal Lecter's home.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.782
- Will Graham could've
given him the details.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.788
- No such_details
were given.

12:04.820 --> 12:08.256
There has not been a word
exchanged between those two men

12:08.290 --> 12:10.884
in my hospital
that I have not heard.

12:10.930 --> 12:14.752
- Then you're aware what Will is
accusing Hannibal Lecter of.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.995
- Oh, yes.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.497
I am aware.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.169
And I am grateful
that I have trouble digesting

12:21.200 --> 12:23.998
animal proteins,
as the last meals I have shared

12:24.040 --> 12:26.167
with Hannibal Lecter
have all been salads.

12:26.210 --> 12:28.428
- Do you believe him?

12:28.480 --> 12:32.769
- Hannibal once served me tongue
and then made a joke
about eating mine.

12:35.320 --> 12:39.484
It would be narrow
to not at least consider it.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.284
- Will is delusional.
He would like

12:42.320 --> 12:45.926
to reinforce his delusion
With you, With me,

12:45.960 --> 12:47.552
with Abel Gideon.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.194
- That doesn't mean
he is not right.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.835
- No, it doesn't.

12:57.340 --> 13:01.003
The Chesapeake Ripper is
killing again...

13:01.040 --> 13:04.942
and Hannibal Lecter is
throwing a dinner party.

13:04.980 --> 13:08.040
- Jack, he fits
the profile.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.844
He is attracted
to medical

13:10.890 --> 13:16.180
and psychological fields because
they offer power over man.

13:16.220 --> 13:18.222
Cannibalism...

13:20.330 --> 13:23.299
...cannibalis_m is
an act of dominance.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.898
(saw buzzing)

14:28.930 --> 14:31.296
- His name's Sheldon Isley!

14:31.330 --> 14:33.639
A Baltimore city councilman!

14:33.670 --> 14:36.264
- Ripper's a politician now!

14:36.300 --> 14:40.009
- At least _
a conservationist.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.634
Five, six years ago, Isley

14:42.680 --> 14:47.640
brokered a woodlands
development deal despite
the disapproval of the EPA.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.116
- So the councilman paved
paradise and put up
a parking lot.

14:51.150 --> 14:54.415
- Well, what he paved was
an important nesting habitat

14:54.460 --> 14:57.429
for endangered songbirds.
The son of a bitch.

14:57.460 --> 15:00.156
- He was wearing this
as a crown.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.327
Autopsy report

15:02.360 --> 15:04.965
gave us what you'd expect
from the Chesapeake Ripper -

15:05.000 --> 15:07.434
pre-mortem surgical dissection,
latex glove impressions,

15:07.470 --> 15:10.132
body was posed
before rigor set in.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.139
- What did the lungs cough up?
- Water.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.503
The councilman was drowned,
lungs filled with aspirated
water. He was standing in water

15:17.550 --> 15:20.542
up to his thighs for
48 to 72 hours before he died.

15:20.580 --> 15:24.118
- To feed the tree.
- Possibly.

15:24.150 --> 15:26.687
- Now, here's
the exciting part.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.553
Tree man actually
bears fruit.

15:29.590 --> 15:33.321
Diatoms. Unicellular colonies.
Good as fingerprints -

15:33.360 --> 15:36.397
no two water sources have
the same diatom population.

15:36.430 --> 15:41.265
- Water in the lungs gives us
location of death. Show me.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.961
- Here,

15:43.010 --> 15:45.604
in a 50-mile radius.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.676
(birds singing)

15:51.680 --> 15:53.614
- My head is filled

15:53.650 --> 15:56.448
with conspiracies.
Too many versions of events

15:56.480 --> 15:58.209
He said she said.

15:58.250 --> 16:01.617
He said she said he said.
It's just maddening.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.026
- In my experience,
that means

16:04.060 --> 16:07.029
a lot of people are lying
about a lot of different things.

16:07.060 --> 16:10.666
- Well, the one thing I have
clarity on is Will Graham
tried to kill Hannibal.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.589
- And thinks
it was a righteous act.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.598
- Well, that says more about
Will than it does
about Hannibal.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.030
Hannibal's been
a teacher,

16:20.080 --> 16:22.275
a mentor, and a friend.
I've known him before

16:22.310 --> 16:25.643
you or Will or any of this.
- I don't claim to know anyone.

16:29.550 --> 16:31.108
- I look at these dogs,

16:31.150 --> 16:34.711
I see the best part
of Will.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.786
But he's lying.
He's manipulating.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.220
He's playing a game and
he's not scared, not anymore.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.469
That's what's
making him dangerous.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.332
- Hello, Dr. Lecter.

17:35.620 --> 17:38.748
- I feel like I've been
watching our friendship
on a split-screen.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.853
The friendship
I perceived on one side

17:42.890 --> 17:45.450
and the truth
on the other.

17:45.490 --> 17:49.494
- It's a terrible
feeling, isn't it?

17:52.500 --> 17:54.468
- You've been lying
to me, Will.

17:54.500 --> 17:58.266
- Well, I-I don't have
a gauge for reality

17:58.310 --> 18:01.336
that works well enough
to know if I've been lying.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.372
- But you understand the reality
of Beverly Katz's death.

18:04.410 --> 18:06.446
You understand
your role in that.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.244
- What was my role?

18:09.280 --> 18:12.249
- Beverly died
at your behest.

18:12.290 --> 18:15.179
You are as angry
with yourself

18:15.220 --> 18:17.757
as you are
with whoever murdered her.

18:17.790 --> 18:20.759
- Actually...

18:20.800 --> 18:24.463
I am singularly angry
with whoever murdered her.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.439
- You tried
to kill me, Will.

18:30.470 --> 18:33.507
It's hard
not to take that personally.

18:33.540 --> 18:36.373
However, if I were
Beverly's murderer...

18:38.610 --> 18:40.578
...I'd applaud your effort.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.487
- Oh, I'm no more guilty
of what you've accused me of

18:43.520 --> 18:46.819
than you are
of what I've accused you of.

18:49.590 --> 18:51.683
- I don't expect you
to feel self-loathing

18:51.730 --> 18:53.618
or regret, or shame.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.924
You knew _
what you were domg,

18:55.960 --> 18:57.928
and you made
your own decisions,

18:57.970 --> 19:00.564
decisions that were
under your control.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.398
- Oh, you think
I'm in control?

19:03.440 --> 19:08.798
- I think you are
more in control now
than you have ever been.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.445
You found a way
to hurt me.

19:15.350 --> 19:18.717
I wonder how many more people
are going to get hurt
by what you do.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.789
I'll give Alana Bloom
your best.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.659
Goodbye, Will.

20:57.950 --> 21:00.680
(door buzzer)

21:12.400 --> 21:17.064
- So, it seems all the king's
horses and all the king's men

21:17.100 --> 21:19.534
could indeed put Humpty
together again.

21:21.540 --> 21:24.043
Is everything back
where I found it?

21:24.080 --> 21:26.378
- With one or two
exceptions.

21:28.780 --> 21:31.044
I know people
who consider me autocratic.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.650
I'm not the most loved
of administrators,

21:33.690 --> 21:37.524
but that nurse you murdered,
she was well-liked.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.528
And so were the attendants
you killed.

21:39.560 --> 21:43.018
There is nothing
like grief and trauma

21:43.060 --> 21:46.496
to pull people together.

21:46.530 --> 21:49.863
Jack Crawford would like
to have a word with you.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.698
I trust you will
behave yourself,

21:52.740 --> 21:54.605
Abel.

21:58.950 --> 22:02.078
- I'm sure you and Frederick
have had many a conversation

22:02.120 --> 22:05.044
about my bad behavior, Jack.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.046
How does he describe me?

22:07.090 --> 22:09.684
- A pure sociopath,
by the book.

22:09.720 --> 22:13.395
- Is that by your book,
Frederick?
- Yes.

22:13.430 --> 22:16.490
- I'd just like to point out
that the word "sociopath" has

22:16.530 --> 22:19.522
not been used by any respected
psychiatrist since 1968.

22:19.570 --> 22:23.062
- Dr. Gideon, do you have
any information about the
Chesapeake Ripper, or not?

22:23.100 --> 22:26.638
- Down to brass tacks.
- You told Will Graham that
you were in Dr. Lecter's home.

22:26.670 --> 22:28.934
Why were you there?
- I have never set foot

22:28.980 --> 22:32.438
in Dr. Lecter's home.
I only met the man a week ago.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.643
However, Dr. Chilton was kind
enough to share the details

22:35.680 --> 22:37.648
of his dining room.
- Why would he do that?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.681
- Yes, why
would he do that?

22:41.690 --> 22:44.420
- Will Graham _is
very keen to believe

22:44.460 --> 22:46.951
that Hannibal Lecter is
the Chesapeake Ripper.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.993
Dr. Chilton did very little
to disavow him

22:50.030 --> 22:53.124
of that notion, and encouraged
me to do the same.

22:53.170 --> 22:57.664
- I apologize, Agent Crawford,
for wasting your time.

22:57.710 --> 23:01.077
- It's not your actions
and betrayal that I resent,

23:01.110 --> 23:04.568
Dr. Chilton;
it's just the lies.

23:04.610 --> 23:06.669
- Mm-hmm.
I'll walk you out.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.075
- Thank you.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.716
- Dr. Chilton hired a nurse
who's had experience

23:16.820 --> 23:20.119
That nurse attempted to murder
Hannibal Lecter, and you blame

23:20.160 --> 23:23.027
Will Graham.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.665
You got the right box
there, Jack,

23:25.700 --> 23:28.089
but you're looking
in the wrong corner.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.529
All the_ coiled resentment
in this place,

23:35.580 --> 23:39.448
it's gotta be bad
for the digestion.

23:39.480 --> 23:43.075
You know that poor Nurse Shell
that I murdered?

23:43.120 --> 23:45.941
I know she's seen _
as some kind of beloved Sister,

23:45.990 --> 23:51.656
but wasn't she also
kind of a good-time girl
with a beer or two inside her?

23:51.690 --> 23:54.158
I asked her if she had eyes
for me, and she said no.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.191
So I had to take 'em.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.096
- Prosciutto roses.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.358
Heart tartare.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.004
Beef roulade.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.370
Whatever this is.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.173
Needless to say,

26:26.210 --> 26:29.919
I will not be
eating the food.

26:29.950 --> 26:31.918
- Nice to see you again,
Dr. Chilton.

26:31.950 --> 26:35.716
- Hm. Hannibal
the Cannibal.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.923
That is what they'll call him,
you know.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.928
- Not according
to Abel Gideon.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.724
- Gideon has given me enough
trouble for one day. The fact

26:43.770 --> 26:47.126
that he lied to you makes
me even more certain he was
telling Will Graham the truth.

26:47.170 --> 26:50.901
- Why did you come here tonight
if you're so convinced?

26:50.940 --> 26:52.908
- DanNinism.

26:52.940 --> 26:55.204
I do not want him to think
I suspect anything.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.902
I really shouldn't be

26:57.950 --> 26:59.838
seen speaking to you.

27:01.980 --> 27:04.244
I don't want to be perceived
as a threat.

27:09.090 --> 27:10.785
- Jack.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.890
I'm so happy you're here.
After all, you are the guest

27:13.930 --> 27:18.094
of honor. You saved my life.
- Unfortunately, my friend,
I can't stay.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.791
Um-- Ooh.

27:19.830 --> 27:22.060
I would love to take some food
to go, if that's all right.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.160
- Of course. I'll get
one of the staff to get you
something from the kitchen.

27:25.210 --> 27:27.735
- No, no. That's all right.
Just, uh, bring me a container

27:27.780 --> 27:30.749
and I'll serve myself
from here. Um,

27:30.780 --> 27:34.079
with your permission,
of course, Dr. Lecter.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.749
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Alana.

27:37.790 --> 27:42.113
I do have your permission,
Dr. Lecter?

27:42.160 --> 27:44.151
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.749
- Eat it soon
or it'll sp0il.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.728
-Z.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.159
Test this.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.297
(playing "Chopsticks")

28:37.380 --> 28:40.838
- Well, the ending
to my composition has been

28:40.880 --> 28:44.111
eluding me, but you may just
have solved that problem
with "Chopsticks."

28:55.330 --> 28:59.027
- If only every problem could be
solved with a simple waltz.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.868
Jack's treating you
like a suspect.

29:07.910 --> 29:11.038
Pointing fingers
in the dark.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.948
- I've walked away
from Will,

29:15.980 --> 29:18.744
but I'm still trailing
his accusations.

29:20.550 --> 29:23.451
- I've walked away too.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.958
I can't forgive Will
for what he did to you.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.967
I just want to walk away
from all of it.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.128
- What does walking away
leave us?

29:34.170 --> 29:36.161
- Each other.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.536
- Hello, Dr. Gideon.

32:09.260 --> 32:13.481
(camera clicks)
- Put the heart monitor on
the guard so no one knew Gideon

32:13.530 --> 32:17.967
was missing, at least as long as
it took for the guard to die,
which wasn't long.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.264
- It was long enough.
- He was strung up with

32:20.300 --> 32:23.337
fish hooks.
Hand-tied flies,

32:23.370 --> 32:25.338
just like Will Graham
used to make.

32:25.370 --> 32:27.531
This one has
a human hair in it,

32:27.570 --> 32:29.606
and a tooth.
- Jack,

32:29.640 --> 32:32.609
there is no way Gideon could've
done any of this

32:32.650 --> 32:35.073
with the injuries he had,
much less get out of bed.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.270
- Well, the last time
Gideon escaped custody,

32:37.320 --> 32:39.686
he went looking
for the Chesapeake Ripper.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.382
He found him, all right.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.456
Last night...

32:44.490 --> 32:46.481
the Ripper found Gideon.

33:10.350 --> 33:13.012
- You're awake.

33:13.050 --> 33:14.449
- So are you.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.254
- I was thinking
about funerals,

33:22.300 --> 33:24.768
and how often
they make us want sex.

33:27.830 --> 33:29.798
- It's one in the eye
for death.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.660
- Not that...

33:31.710 --> 33:34.679
This wasn't...
funeral sex or--

33:34.710 --> 33:37.634
- Of course it was.

33:37.680 --> 33:41.411
We both just buried
a friend.

33:41.450 --> 33:43.577
We buried Will.

33:47.250 --> 33:50.253
- There's something liberating
about finally letting him go.

33:53.190 --> 33:56.455
- Yes. There is.

34:04.740 --> 34:07.709
We have a lot of reasons
to do this;

34:07.740 --> 34:09.731
not just
funeral reasons.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.319
(doorbell)

34:18.350 --> 34:20.739
Last time someone rang
my doorbell this early,

34:20.790 --> 34:22.678
it was a census taker.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.459
(doorbell)

34:30.460 --> 34:32.189
I'll see who it is.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.719
Jack.
- Hannibal.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.445
- What can I do for you?

34:51.490 --> 34:53.082
- We need to talk.

34:58.890 --> 35:02.724
Abel Gideon fell
down a stairwell last night.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.466
He was hospitalized.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.321
The security guard
standing watch has been killed

35:07.370 --> 35:10.897
in what appears to be another
Chesapeake Ripper murder.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.908
Gideon is nowhere
to be found.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.669
- He escaped?

35:14.710 --> 35:16.632
- We know he didn't leave
the hospital on his own.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.875
His back was broken.
He was taken by someone -

35:18.910 --> 35:21.105
someone who knew him.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.143
Where were you last night?

35:30.860 --> 35:32.521
- I was here.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.199
- All night?

35:35.230 --> 35:37.255
- Yes.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.268
- Anyone other than
yourself

35:39.300 --> 35:42.497
that can verify that?
- I can.

35:45.740 --> 35:48.300
I was with Hannibal
all night, Jack.

35:52.610 --> 35:54.817
What are you accusing him of?
- I'm not accusing him

35:54.850 --> 35:57.648
of anything;
only asking his whereabouts.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.547
- That's not all
you're asking.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.297
Rti de cuisse.

36:41.330 --> 36:42.991
Clay-roasted thigh.

36:43.030 --> 36:47.228
And canoe-cut marrow bone.

36:47.270 --> 36:49.636
(classical music playing)

36:59.810 --> 37:03.314
I love cooking with clay.

37:03.350 --> 37:05.989
It creates _
a more succulent dish

37:06.020 --> 37:08.250
and adds a little

37:08.290 --> 37:11.680
theatricality to dinner.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.789
We come from clay,
return to clay.

37:16.800 --> 37:22.261
Shall I carve?
- I think you already have.

37:22.300 --> 37:25.428
- Your legs are
no good to you anymore.

37:25.470 --> 37:27.802
You've got a T-4 fracture
of the vertebra.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.729
This is a far more
practical use

37:30.780 --> 37:32.771
for those limbs.

37:35.050 --> 37:38.884
- Hard to have anything,
isn't it, Dr. Lecter?

37:38.920 --> 37:42.708
Rare to get it,
hard to keep it.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.628
A damn slippery life.

37:52.630 --> 37:55.895
- You were determined to know
the Chesapeake Ripper,
Dr. Gideon.

37:58.670 --> 38:00.831
Now is your opportunity.

38:00.870 --> 38:04.647
- You intend me to be
my own last supper?

38:04.680 --> 38:06.545
- Yes.

38:09.450 --> 38:11.680
- How does one
politely refuse a dish

38:11.720 --> 38:13.688
in circumstances
such as these?

38:13.720 --> 38:17.451
- One doesn't.

38:17.490 --> 38:19.879
The tragedy is not
to die, Abel,

38:19.930 --> 38:21.727
but to be wasted.

38:52.490 --> 38:54.629
- My compliments
to the chef.

38:57.460 --> 39:01.863
- Goose, pig, cow.
- Not just cow; Wagyu beef.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.993
There's about $100 worth
right there.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.667
- How do you know it's not Kobe?

39:05.710 --> 39:08.599
- Well, all Kobe is Wagyu;
not all Wagyu is Kobe.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.939
- OK.
- Well, at least we know
Dr. Lecter wasn't serving up

39:11.980 --> 39:14.813
people.
- You want people?

39:14.850 --> 39:17.068
The Chesapeake Ripper has been
tying flies with them,

39:17.120 --> 39:19.839
just like Will Graham
allegedly did.

39:22.660 --> 39:24.787
Ha_ir woven _into the
monofilaments is Beverly's;

39:24.830 --> 39:26.786
bone fragments
of Miriam Lass;

39:26.830 --> 39:29.424
veining from
Sheldon Isley, uh,

39:29.460 --> 39:31.564
optical nerve and arteries
from Judge Davies,

39:31.600 --> 39:35.468
and a toenail from James Gray,
our muralist -

39:35.500 --> 39:37.730
all victims
of the Chesapeake Ripper.

39:37.770 --> 39:40.159
- These four lures are almost
identical to what we found

39:40.210 --> 39:42.075
in Will's house,
made with material from

39:42.110 --> 39:45.170
the exact same human remains:
Abigail Hobbs,

39:45.210 --> 39:47.906
Donald Sutcliffe,
Marissa Schuur,

39:47.950 --> 39:50.919
Georgia Madchen.

39:50.950 --> 39:54.181
- Will didn't kill
any of these people.

39:54.220 --> 39:58.782
There was no copycat;
never was.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.924
It was always the Ripper.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.394
Finally taking credit
for all of his murders.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.794
- Maybe too much credit.
Found something else

40:08.840 --> 40:11.468
in the lures.
- Madrona bark -

40:11.510 --> 40:14.070
a tree almost non-existent
on the east coast,

40:14.110 --> 40:16.578
but this bark was
peeled recently.

40:16.610 --> 40:19.443
- There's a small stand
of madrona bark in Virginia.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.540
- Inside your diatom
search area?

40:22.580 --> 40:24.912
- Yep.

40:24.950 --> 40:26.508
Here.

40:26.550 --> 40:30.554
***
(Hannibal's harpsichord piece)

42:22.340 --> 42:24.604
- Miriam.
