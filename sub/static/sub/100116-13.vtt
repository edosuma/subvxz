WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:02.580
Previously on Legacies...
You're the oracle.

00:02.580 --> 00:03.830
What's coming next?

00:03.830 --> 00:07.210
SPHINX:
A new hero rises...

00:07.210 --> 00:09.210
but can be felled
by the golden arrow.

00:09.210 --> 00:13.050
The sins of the father
are visited upon the daughters.

00:13.050 --> 00:14.890
Where are we?
Prison world.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.010
ALARIC:
I'm guessing Alyssa Chang

00:16.010 --> 00:18.430
wants to teach me a lesson.

00:18.430 --> 00:21.390
SPHINX: There are two prisoners.
JOSIE: You're Kai Parker.

00:21.390 --> 00:22.890
You're a monster.
That vampire,

00:22.890 --> 00:24.400
she's the real monster.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.230
She and her cronies run this
world.

00:26.230 --> 00:27.940
JOSIE:
She used to go to my school.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.940
ALARIC:
I knew what I had to do.

00:29.940 --> 00:31.860
I wasn't gonna unleash you
into the world.

00:31.860 --> 00:33.070
If you can survive being hunted

00:33.070 --> 00:34.740
for 24 hours,

00:34.740 --> 00:36.070
I will let your daughter live.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.700
SPHINX:
When time fractures,

00:37.700 --> 00:39.490
darkness overwhelms.

00:39.490 --> 00:41.750
I found my own way out of here.
And I'd hate for you to forget

00:41.750 --> 00:43.620
the only thing
that can save you.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.090
SPHINX:
Don't worry.

00:47.090 --> 00:50.460
It will all be painfully clear
soon enough.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.980
(inhales sharply)

01:01.980 --> 01:03.100
He's here.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.280
(low growling)

01:12.570 --> 01:14.110
Wait.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.950
(screams)

01:15.950 --> 01:17.570
Stay down.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.160
Stay down!
(roars)

01:25.000 --> 01:27.170
Wendy, I don't want to hurt you.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.850
Jade, he's in the house!

01:48.310 --> 01:49.400
(Alaric sighs)

01:49.400 --> 01:51.940
(whooshing)

01:55.990 --> 01:57.910
Tag. You're it.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.570
(laughs)

01:59.570 --> 02:03.160
Oh, come on.
Let's not fight.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.960
We don't want to waste
any of that blood.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.500
(screaming)

02:12.500 --> 02:14.880
I shut off my humanity
that night.

02:21.220 --> 02:23.220
(panting)

02:27.640 --> 02:29.650
I'm so sorry.

02:35.860 --> 02:36.990
(quietly):
Josie.

02:38.570 --> 02:39.910
What did you do?

02:41.200 --> 02:42.950
I fixed her.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.880
(distant voices, laughter)

03:01.970 --> 03:06.180
♪ But when the arrow finds him,
a new hero dies ♪

03:06.180 --> 03:10.190
♪ A new hero rises,
and he will take flight ♪

03:10.190 --> 03:14.190

03:22.200 --> 03:23.780

03:23.780 --> 03:25.490
Stop saying that.

03:25.490 --> 03:26.620
(Sphinx speaks backward)

03:26.620 --> 03:28.160
SPHINX:
A new hero rises

03:28.160 --> 03:31.370
but can be felled
by the golden arrow.

03:31.370 --> 03:33.420
Landon.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.380
No, no.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.380
JOSIE:
Hope.

03:40.380 --> 03:41.930
(echoing):
We're not alone.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.600
We're not alone.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.080
HOPE:
Oh, what's all this?
Oh.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.410
I couldn't sleep.
And I was just up all night

04:07.410 --> 04:08.910
trying to figure out
how I was able to fly.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.120
Or, you know, float.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.120
Oh, my God. Tell me you didn't.
Oh, it's just

04:12.120 --> 04:13.630
from the top of the garage.
I had to see

04:13.630 --> 04:14.710
if I could make myself
do it again.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.040
'Cause the current
working theory

04:16.040 --> 04:17.250
is the spike of adrenaline
when we kissed

04:17.250 --> 04:20.470
caused something to happen,
but so far, um...

04:20.470 --> 04:22.260
Hey.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.090
What's wrong?

04:23.090 --> 04:25.350
I had a dream last night

04:25.350 --> 04:28.470
that you were hurt
and I-I couldn't save you.

04:28.470 --> 04:30.060
It's the prophecy, right?

04:31.350 --> 04:33.440
Look, just because I hovered

04:33.440 --> 04:37.480
off the ground once doesn't mean
that I'm the hero who rises.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.150
It could be Wade,
for all we know.

04:39.150 --> 04:40.150
He's the one
with actual wings.
No, Dorian said

04:40.150 --> 04:41.530
that there is a golden arrow

04:41.530 --> 04:43.280
in the inventory
of our stolen arsenal.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.570
What if it is the one thing
that can kill a phoenix?

04:45.570 --> 04:47.240
Then you'll Superwoman in
and save the day,

04:47.240 --> 04:48.950
like you always do.

04:48.950 --> 04:51.870
Except I'm pretty much failing
as a hero lately.

04:51.870 --> 04:54.460
I have no idea how to bring
the Saltzmans back.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.130
I know-- I know you feel
like you have to fix this...

04:57.130 --> 04:59.000
Because I do. If I
don't bring them back,

04:59.000 --> 05:00.130
no one else will.

05:00.130 --> 05:01.920
If I could just talk to them,

05:01.920 --> 05:03.760
Dr. Saltzman would know
what to...
That's not an option.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.130
You told me
that astral projection

05:05.130 --> 05:06.800
into a prison world
is dangerous.

05:09.180 --> 05:10.520
Look, I know

05:10.520 --> 05:12.310
you feel
like this is all on you,

05:12.310 --> 05:13.310
but you're
not alone.

05:13.310 --> 05:14.310
You have me.

05:14.310 --> 05:16.310
We'll figure it out.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.150
Co-heroes, remember?

05:19.020 --> 05:20.730
Fine.

05:20.730 --> 05:23.150
But this co-hero is officially
banned from flight attempt

05:23.150 --> 05:24.990
until the golden
arrow is found, okay?

05:24.990 --> 05:26.320
No putting myself in danger.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.320
No risky astral projection.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.030
Deal?

05:29.030 --> 05:32.700
Besides, that golden arrow
of yours is as good as found.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.500
Dorian has some
of our top men working on it.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.500
Come on, nerd. Just turn
the damn thing on already.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.710
I'm reading the instructions.

05:41.710 --> 05:44.260
Now, apparently, this thing
glows when it gets close

05:44.260 --> 05:45.760
to the other identical moth,

05:45.760 --> 05:46.800
which was

05:46.800 --> 05:47.970
somewhere in the arsenal stash

05:47.970 --> 05:49.180
that got stolen...
Magical LoJack.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.350
Got it. Can we go?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.140
Slow down there,
Teen Wolf.

05:52.140 --> 05:53.520
You're not in charge
of this mission.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.020
Oh, and you are?
No one is.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.390
So stop
giving orders.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.150
Look, you want to get
our loot back or not?

05:58.150 --> 05:59.360
'Cause we're
wasting time.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.520
Actually, Dorian was very clear

06:00.520 --> 06:02.030
about this being
a recon mission.

06:02.030 --> 06:04.030
Yeah, we know.
Okay, teacher's pet.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.240
What's with
the sudden toxicity?

06:09.070 --> 06:11.080
See?

06:11.080 --> 06:13.200
It's not that
complicated, Milton.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.290
This way.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.290
"Milton"?
He asking for it, bro.

06:17.290 --> 06:20.420
Um, is this a-a vamp-wolf thing?
(sighs)

06:20.420 --> 06:21.380
No, it's...

06:21.380 --> 06:23.420
Um, it's nothing.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.670
Come on.
W...

06:25.670 --> 06:27.430
Well, what?

06:27.430 --> 06:30.090
What exactly did you do to Jade?

06:30.090 --> 06:31.470
Josie, talk to me.

06:31.470 --> 06:33.350
Lizzie's this way.
I can feel her.

06:33.350 --> 06:35.140
Why did you break the Sandclock?

06:37.440 --> 06:39.230
I can't remember.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.980
Well, are you okay?

06:42.980 --> 06:44.280
I mean, are you in pain?

06:44.280 --> 06:45.990
No.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.400
For the first time in my
life, everything feels...

06:48.400 --> 06:49.910
clear.

06:51.070 --> 06:52.080
There.

06:55.410 --> 06:56.370
Lizzie.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.790
Lizzie.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.420
It's okay, honey.
Easy does it.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.460
Dad.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.170
(exhales)

07:09.090 --> 07:10.260
Something's wrong.

07:10.260 --> 07:13.100
It feels like my mind
is breaking.

07:15.350 --> 07:16.310
It's okay.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.310
Easy does it.
(groans)

07:17.310 --> 07:19.060
We need to get you
to the hospital.

07:19.060 --> 07:21.020
Everything's gonna be just fine.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.270
(Lizzie coughs)

07:22.270 --> 07:24.940
Dad, I drank vampire blood.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.690
Please don't let me die.

07:26.690 --> 07:29.900
You're not gonna die.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.530
(knocking)

07:31.530 --> 07:32.870
(indistinct chatter)

07:32.870 --> 07:34.870
(whispers):
All right.

07:35.870 --> 07:37.080
Can I help you?

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
Hello.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.660
My name's Joshua.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.880
Alaric said I could drop by
and stay for a few days

07:42.880 --> 07:45.170
whenever I'm in town, so...

07:45.170 --> 07:47.050
here I am.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.260
How-how do you know
Dr. Saltzman?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.470
Oh, Ric and I go way back.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.300
(chuckles)
I was at his wedding.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.550
(chuckles)
Brought quite the gift.

07:54.550 --> 07:56.430
Yeah.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.940
I'm sorry. He's not here.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.480
Yeah, I'll-I'll let him know
that you stopped by, though.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.690
Oh...

08:04.690 --> 08:07.110
No, there's no point.
He wouldn't remember me.

08:07.110 --> 08:09.110
But I hear it's been a little
hectic at the school lately,

08:09.110 --> 08:11.320
and you might not have taken
your vervain as usual.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.360
Why don't you go

08:12.360 --> 08:14.370
find someone who would be able

08:14.370 --> 08:16.370
to invite me in.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.020
(panting)

08:28.020 --> 08:30.480
(groaning)

08:30.480 --> 08:31.770
(coughs)

08:32.480 --> 08:34.610
(groaning)

08:34.610 --> 08:36.110
You're gonna be okay, Lizzie.
It's all right, it's all right.

08:36.110 --> 08:37.570
The black magic
is making her worse.

08:37.570 --> 08:40.410
She won't make it
with it inside her.
Well, Josie,

08:40.410 --> 08:41.200
can you do something?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.120
(crying)

08:42.120 --> 08:43.620
Josie. Please.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.700
I'll be unconscious
for a little while.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.370
Don't be scared.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.250
(panting)

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
(exhales)

09:02.680 --> 09:04.260
I can help.
(gasps)

09:08.520 --> 09:10.480
(breathing heavily)

09:10.480 --> 09:12.560
(grunts)
Dr. Saltzman.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.570
It's me.

09:14.570 --> 09:15.730
I don't know how,

09:15.730 --> 09:18.320
but Josie turned my humanity
back on.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.320
Look, you can still kill me
if you want to, all right?

09:20.320 --> 09:22.320
I know
that I deserve it.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.660
But I was training as an EMT
when I was 16,

09:24.660 --> 09:26.330
and I've spent
the last ten years learning

09:26.330 --> 09:28.330
how to patch people up
after a fight, all right?

09:28.330 --> 09:30.170
I can help her.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.170
But I can't be near the blood.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.630
So you're just gonna have
to do exactly what I tell you.

09:41.510 --> 09:43.550
(footfalls approaching)

09:43.550 --> 09:46.310
Hey.

09:46.310 --> 09:47.680
What's all this?

09:47.680 --> 09:49.730
A flightless co-hero
being useful.

09:49.730 --> 09:50.690
(chuckles)

09:50.690 --> 09:52.310
Any progress?
No.

09:52.310 --> 09:53.560
Alyssa spelled it
so every time I repair it,

09:53.560 --> 09:54.770
it just breaks again.

09:54.770 --> 09:56.070
And you can't...

09:56.070 --> 09:57.150
unspell it?

09:57.150 --> 09:58.650
No.

09:58.650 --> 10:00.490
No. There's got to be

10:00.490 --> 10:01.910
something I'm overlooking.

10:01.910 --> 10:03.200
KAI:
There is.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.870
Sorry, you have
the wrong ascendant.

10:05.870 --> 10:07.660
Oh? Says who?

10:07.660 --> 10:09.540
Fam, meet...

10:09.540 --> 10:10.750
Joshua.
Hello.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.210
DORIAN:
Old friend of Ric's.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.290
And-- drumroll,
please--

10:14.290 --> 10:15.670
he's also an expert

10:15.670 --> 10:17.630
on prison worlds.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.380
I told him
about our problem.

10:19.380 --> 10:20.720
Do you mind if I...?

10:21.760 --> 10:23.300
Thank you so much.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.890
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.600
It is in pieces.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.350
Oh, my.

10:28.350 --> 10:30.020
Yeah.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.350
(gasps softly)

10:31.350 --> 10:33.190
There's a linking spell on this.

10:33.190 --> 10:35.610
It produces a,
a faint hum,

10:35.610 --> 10:38.190
like a, like a melody, if you,

10:38.190 --> 10:39.730
if you know what
to listen for.

10:39.730 --> 10:41.650
You clearly don't.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.990
When the Saltzmans performed

10:43.990 --> 10:45.910
their spell
on-on this ascendant,

10:45.910 --> 10:48.580
they were being tied to another.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.120
Hold this.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.750
That witch
of yours

10:52.750 --> 10:54.330
didn't send them to, you know,

10:54.330 --> 10:55.790
a new, empty prison world.

10:55.790 --> 10:57.920
She sent them somewhere,
somewhere

10:57.920 --> 10:59.250
far older and...

10:59.250 --> 11:00.760
(liquid pouring)

11:00.760 --> 11:01.760
...much more dangerous.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.760
And you're going to need my help

11:06.760 --> 11:08.600
to get them out.

11:11.430 --> 11:12.430
Would you asshats listen to me?

11:12.430 --> 11:14.850
We got to go this way.

11:14.850 --> 11:16.060
Uh...

11:16.060 --> 11:17.190
Mm-hmm.

11:17.190 --> 11:18.820
You mean this way, Magellan.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.570
Nice job.

11:24.570 --> 11:26.700
You broke it.
I didn't break it.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.620
Guys, listen, I think
we should just take five

11:28.620 --> 11:29.830
and read the instructions.
Oh, please, please.

11:29.830 --> 11:30.950
We might have missed...
Spare us your

11:30.950 --> 11:32.040
"I'm an evolved vampire" act.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.830
Hey, leave him alone.

11:33.830 --> 11:34.830
Or, what, you'll
sing me to death?

11:34.830 --> 11:36.000
Boy, I'll...
Guys!

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Listen. It doesn't matter

11:39.000 --> 11:42.010
what the previous generations
of werewolves and vampires

11:42.010 --> 11:43.590
did to each other.
MG...

11:43.590 --> 11:44.760
Some of my
best friends

11:44.760 --> 11:46.090
are wolves, okay?
Look, Milton, it's...

11:46.090 --> 11:48.510
We have to rise
above the stereotypes.

11:48.510 --> 11:50.100
We have to abso...
It's Alyssa.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.850
Huh? Who? Wha...?

11:51.850 --> 11:53.310
(smacks lips)

11:53.310 --> 11:55.230
Oh.

11:55.230 --> 11:56.440
You're acting
like a dick

11:56.440 --> 11:58.190
because me and Alyssa had that

11:58.190 --> 11:59.980
one date? I mean,
it was a sting

11:59.980 --> 12:02.230
operation, man,
and she straight-up

12:02.230 --> 12:05.030
sent the Saltzmans
to a prison world.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.240
Allegedly.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.700
(stammers)
Okay,
bottom line,

12:07.700 --> 12:09.200
dark evil temptresses

12:09.200 --> 12:11.080
aren't really my thing anymore.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.830
Yeah, then why are you
all she ever talks about?

12:12.830 --> 12:13.870
She doesn't even see
the rest of us.

12:13.870 --> 12:16.620
Uh, speak for yourself, homeboy.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.830
Oh. Oh!

12:18.830 --> 12:20.790
You're both into her?

12:20.790 --> 12:23.840
So, y'all are
into the same girl.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.340
And then she...

12:25.340 --> 12:27.470
she's into me. Oh!

12:27.470 --> 12:29.890
I-I guess I must be
cute or something.

12:29.890 --> 12:31.350
You enjoy that while you can,
because I'm pretty sure

12:31.350 --> 12:33.060
she'll be seeing things a little
differently soon, so...

12:33.060 --> 12:35.480
Yeah, well, they say eyesight's
the first thing to go, so...

12:35.480 --> 12:37.310
Well, how about I mess up
your eyesight right now?

12:37.310 --> 12:39.310
(overlapping arguing)
Shut up and look.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.310
(growling)

12:44.070 --> 12:46.070
We're tracking a moving target.

12:49.780 --> 12:51.450
HOPE:
It's worse than we thought.

12:51.450 --> 12:54.080
The Saltzmans are stuck inside
of a prison world with

12:54.080 --> 12:56.160
the guy who murdered their
mother-- they're all in danger.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.040
Alyssa must have kept
the original ascendant hidden.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.750
You know she's not just
gonna hand it over.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.250
I have to know if
the Saltzmans are still alive.

13:01.250 --> 13:02.920
And the only way to do it is
to astral-project there.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.880
Hope... we had a deal.
You might get lost

13:05.880 --> 13:07.590
and not find your way back.
In my dream

13:07.590 --> 13:09.720
Josie said to me,
"We're not alone."

13:09.720 --> 13:12.050
Okay.
Look, Landon,
I have to try.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.890
If they've been in danger this
whole time and something happens

13:13.890 --> 13:15.600
because I couldn't find
a way to save them...

13:15.600 --> 13:16.890
(knocking)

13:16.890 --> 13:18.770
Hey, sorry to intrude.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.730
Got some good
news-- so...

13:20.730 --> 13:22.360
Joshua's doing some research
for us. He said there's

13:22.360 --> 13:24.520
a rare flower
that grows near the falls.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.990
The extract makes people tell
you their deepest secrets.

13:26.990 --> 13:28.950
If we give that to Alyssa,

13:28.950 --> 13:31.070
we can get her to tell us
where the ascendant is.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.780
Landon, you come
with me.

13:32.780 --> 13:33.910
Yeah.
No.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.540
He stays here.
Hey.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.120
You try to contact them,
I'll be right back.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.080
Okay?

13:38.080 --> 13:39.830
If we take risks,

13:39.830 --> 13:41.170
we take them together.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.790
I'll keep him safe.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.090
I promise.

13:50.590 --> 13:52.220
(monitor beeping)

13:52.220 --> 13:55.640
JADE: Okay, now you're gonna
need to stop the bleeding.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.020
There's a Laughlin clamp
on the tray.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.730
It kind of looks like...
Yeah, I know what it looks like.

14:00.730 --> 14:01.940
Her mom invented it.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.690
(monitor beeping)

14:06.520 --> 14:08.780
(squishing)

14:15.030 --> 14:17.160
(exhales)

14:17.160 --> 14:19.040
Okay.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.830
Vessel's sealed.

14:20.830 --> 14:23.040
Her pulse
is steady.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.750
Thank you.

14:32.010 --> 14:33.590
Hello again.

14:35.890 --> 14:37.970
What happened to you?

14:37.970 --> 14:39.270
She did something dangerous
with black magic.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.480
And now she can't recall why.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.890
I must have had a reason.

14:42.890 --> 14:44.400
But it's blank.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.980
There's something's missing
from my memory.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.070
Or someone.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.650
Uh... same.

14:50.650 --> 14:53.240
I don't know what this is,
but I found it in my pocket.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.410
Who's Kai?

15:02.410 --> 15:03.830
The person who's missing

15:03.830 --> 15:04.920
from our memory.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.880
There's a spell
affecting my mind.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.510
I've felt it before.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.720
Malivore.

15:16.010 --> 15:18.300
You might want to
grab a seat, Jade.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.220
Why?
Trust me.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.310
Harae-tamai kioku
yomigaerashi-tamae.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.070
(indistinct chatter)

15:34.820 --> 15:36.320
Mm-hmm.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.040
Oh, well, well.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.290
The Salvatore School.

15:50.290 --> 15:52.760
How I've not missed you.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.880
I told you I could get in.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.130
And they have honey ham.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.050
Don't brag--
it's unbecoming.

15:57.050 --> 16:00.220
You underestimate the Tribrid
at your own peril.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.260
Oh, I have a plan for her.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.560
I always have a plan.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.060
Which is what?

16:05.060 --> 16:07.900
(crunching)
Ah.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.480
Now, I gave you all
the information you needed,

16:11.480 --> 16:13.530
so now I think it's time
you return the favor, heretic.

16:13.530 --> 16:16.570
Look, Mr. Necromancer.

16:16.570 --> 16:18.360
The Necromancer!

16:18.360 --> 16:21.280
(groans)

16:22.740 --> 16:24.080
The.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.250
Sure. You're gonna get
what you want, okay?

16:27.250 --> 16:30.500
Josie Saltzman, crackling with
all the black magic you need,

16:30.500 --> 16:34.460
if you back off
and do exactly as I say.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.970
I'm listening.

16:35.970 --> 16:38.180
Still got that golden arrow?

16:38.180 --> 16:40.470
LANDON:
This shouldn't take long.

16:40.470 --> 16:43.350
Right? I can't believe I've
lived in Mystic Falls this long,

16:43.350 --> 16:46.350
and I've never actually
seen the falls, you know?

16:48.060 --> 16:49.940
Mr. Williams?

16:51.560 --> 16:53.150
You okay?

16:53.150 --> 16:54.150
(grunts)

17:10.730 --> 17:12.780
You must be Alyssa.

17:13.990 --> 17:16.110
Big fan of your work.

17:16.110 --> 17:19.200
How do you feel about team-ups?

17:34.670 --> 17:35.920
Where's Lizzie?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.630
Sleeping upstairs.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.350
Kai.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.060
Try to control your emotions.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.310
I remember
what Kai said.

17:43.310 --> 17:45.430
There's still a way
for us to get out.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.440
This whole place is
just another spell.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.100
It's made of magic.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.770
Magic can be siphoned.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.070
I can make holes
in this world.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.650
Doors.
(footfalls approach)

17:54.650 --> 17:57.530
So, does this mean you can get
us back into the real world?

18:00.740 --> 18:02.870
It's all right.

18:02.870 --> 18:04.330
I talked to them.

18:04.330 --> 18:06.460
We just want to go home.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.500
Well, we can't
all go.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.750
The magic I siphon here can't
travel to the real world.

18:10.750 --> 18:13.130
The energy needs to go
somewhere, which means

18:13.130 --> 18:14.670
someone needs to stay behind

18:14.670 --> 18:16.090
to be the anchor.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.970
It should be Diego.

18:17.970 --> 18:19.130
No offense.

18:19.130 --> 18:20.590
ALARIC:
No.

18:20.590 --> 18:23.140
We're not leaving anyone here.

18:24.310 --> 18:26.020
We're all getting back.

18:26.020 --> 18:28.100
Shh.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.980
Someone's coming.

18:31.730 --> 18:33.320
Josie?

18:33.320 --> 18:35.530
Hello.

18:37.110 --> 18:39.610
Only I can see you.

18:39.610 --> 18:41.700
What happened to you?

18:41.700 --> 18:43.580
I broke the Sandclock.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.990
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

18:45.990 --> 18:48.620
Honey, who are you talking to?

18:48.620 --> 18:51.000
Hope-- she's astral-projecting.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.630
Listen, you have
to warn her about Kai.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.290
Why? What happened?

18:54.290 --> 18:55.710
Kai went into the Malivore pit,
and we think

18:55.710 --> 18:57.130
he's trying to get
to the real world.

18:57.130 --> 18:58.550
Actually, I think
he's already here,

18:58.550 --> 19:00.130
pretending to be someone else.

19:00.130 --> 19:01.510
Kai's at the school.

19:01.510 --> 19:03.850
Oh. Hope?

19:03.850 --> 19:06.430
Listen to me, Kai's
incredibly dangerous.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.180
You have to get him
away from the school now.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.310
Good luck, Hope.

19:10.310 --> 19:12.020
Wait...

19:12.020 --> 19:14.980
We need to do whatever it takes
to get out of here.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.230
Fine.

19:16.230 --> 19:19.530
We do the spell.

19:19.530 --> 19:22.110
And I'll stay behind.

19:22.110 --> 19:24.200
You were all my students once.

19:26.410 --> 19:27.580
It has to be me.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.170
(gasping)

19:34.380 --> 19:36.340
How'd all that go?

19:36.340 --> 19:38.380
It didn't.

19:38.380 --> 19:40.630
I couldn't reach them.

19:40.630 --> 19:41.970
Oh.

19:45.260 --> 19:47.470
Did you need something?

19:47.470 --> 19:49.390
(sniffing deeply)

19:51.100 --> 19:52.230
It's not you.

19:52.230 --> 19:54.230
It's not me.

19:54.230 --> 19:55.060
Excuse me?

19:55.060 --> 19:56.570
No.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.110
Yes, there it is.
(chuckles)

19:59.110 --> 20:01.360
Oh, why is it always
stuffed animals?

20:01.360 --> 20:03.950
It's the weirdest thing.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.030
How did you know?

20:08.030 --> 20:10.120
Oh, Alyssa Chang
just needed a, uh,

20:10.120 --> 20:12.040
a compassionate ear to bend.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.920
Hey, I'm sorry to, uh,

20:13.920 --> 20:16.170
stick my nose in, but she
really doesn't like you people.

20:16.170 --> 20:17.840
Anyhoo...

20:17.840 --> 20:20.210
now all you need
is something

20:20.210 --> 20:22.050
that has the equivalent power
of a celestial event.

20:22.050 --> 20:24.010
Do you have any ideas?

20:25.430 --> 20:26.970
I do.

20:28.050 --> 20:29.510
But we have to go off-campus

20:29.510 --> 20:30.680
to get it.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.020
Who doesn't love a field trip?

20:48.700 --> 20:51.040
Huh.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.290
That smells old.

20:53.290 --> 20:54.830
Wow, wow, wow.

20:54.830 --> 20:56.880
This doesn't seem
like much of a spot

20:56.880 --> 20:59.460
for a powerful
magical artifact.

20:59.460 --> 21:01.130
Neither does
a stuffed elephant.

21:01.130 --> 21:03.420
(chuckles)
That's very good.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.010
Dr. Saltzman hid what we need
in one of these crates, so...

21:09.260 --> 21:10.930
Look for the
Salvatore logo.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.140
It's a good thing
there's not, like,

21:13.140 --> 21:15.770
(laughing):
400 crates in here.

21:15.770 --> 21:18.100
Eeny, meeny,

21:18.100 --> 21:21.360
miny, crate.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.200
When you say Salvatore logo,
you mean, like, that

21:25.200 --> 21:28.030
thing with the "S"
and the squiggle?

21:38.290 --> 21:40.130
And so it begins.

21:40.130 --> 21:41.500
(speaks foreign language)

21:43.170 --> 21:44.380
(grunts)

21:44.380 --> 21:46.130
Icaeus.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.680
Nice try.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.100
(grunting)

21:56.890 --> 21:58.020
You could have blocked that.

21:58.020 --> 22:00.020
Yeah, you're right.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.730
I-I just wanted you to think
you were doing a good job.

22:02.730 --> 22:05.780
(chuckles)
You're not trying to beat me.

22:05.780 --> 22:08.780
Oh, no. No, not for a...
a few more minutes.

22:08.780 --> 22:10.740
Because right now,

22:10.740 --> 22:12.780
Alyssa Chang is performing
a spell that will sever

22:12.780 --> 22:14.290
my connection
to the prison world.

22:14.290 --> 22:16.330
And since that
place was created

22:16.330 --> 22:18.420
for me, once she's done...

22:18.420 --> 22:19.750
The world will disappear.

22:21.330 --> 22:23.340
Along with everyone
inside of it.

22:23.340 --> 22:26.170
Oops.

22:28.050 --> 22:30.840
(grunts)

22:30.840 --> 22:32.390
Thanks so much
for the villain monologue.

22:32.390 --> 22:33.930
I'll deal with you later.

22:33.930 --> 22:35.930
Hey, before
you go rushing off,

22:35.930 --> 22:37.640
there's something
you should probably know.

22:40.230 --> 22:42.770
I compelled what's-his-name.

22:42.770 --> 22:44.230
Who's with, uh,

22:44.230 --> 22:45.730
you know, your boyfriend,
curly-hair?

22:45.730 --> 22:47.320
Lando. There it is.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.820
That's thanks to you.

22:48.820 --> 22:50.360
As we sit here chatting,

22:50.360 --> 22:53.200
they're headed east,
away from the school,

22:53.200 --> 22:57.290
into the woods,
walking straight into the path

22:57.290 --> 22:59.370
of a golden arrow.

22:59.370 --> 23:01.790
You're lying.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.670
You know, for once, I'm not.

23:03.670 --> 23:07.670
I guess we'll find out
if that prophecy's really true.

23:09.470 --> 23:11.470
Oh, you can stop
doing the math in your head.

23:11.470 --> 23:13.550
You'll never make it
to both places in time.

23:15.390 --> 23:17.970
You can't save them all.

23:17.970 --> 23:22.100
So, you, uh... you have
a little choice to make.

23:23.270 --> 23:25.270
Who's it gonna be?

23:27.400 --> 23:29.320
(laughing)

23:35.180 --> 23:37.270
(growling)

23:48.820 --> 23:51.160
Now, who's the hero now?
Are you for real?

23:51.160 --> 23:53.160
(distorted groaning)

23:53.160 --> 23:55.330
Guys, I, I hear something.

23:55.330 --> 23:57.710
But, man, at most, you get
an assist. I did all the
heavy hitting, for real.

23:57.710 --> 23:59.210
JED:
You kicked him in the chest.
I stabbed him in the...

23:59.210 --> 24:00.830
KALEB:
I used my vampire
powers, Jed.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.340
You're the one that hit him
with a stick like a child.

24:03.340 --> 24:04.590
I'm so damn fast
and so strong...

24:04.590 --> 24:06.590
(groaning)

24:10.180 --> 24:12.050
(groans)

24:14.350 --> 24:15.600
Raf?

24:15.600 --> 24:18.180
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

24:19.810 --> 24:21.350
It's gonna be all right, man.

24:21.350 --> 24:23.650
We're gonna get you out of here.

24:23.650 --> 24:25.570
JOSIE:
We need to work together.

24:25.570 --> 24:28.360
Place the spires in a circle
to create a boundary spell.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.990
As I begin to siphon,

24:29.990 --> 24:31.610
doors will open
beneath them.

24:31.610 --> 24:34.240
Each door can only transport
one person.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.370
Once I begin the spell,
I cannot stop until it is done.

24:37.370 --> 24:40.120
So, when you see the door,
you have to go.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.320
(chiming)

25:12.320 --> 25:15.570
Dad, don't do this.
We'll find another way.

25:15.570 --> 25:17.200
Lizzie, there's no time.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.620
Kai got out. He's at the school.

25:18.620 --> 25:20.250
Hope's trying to
stop him, but if

25:20.250 --> 25:22.040
she can't, you and
Josie have to.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.330
You got to go now.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.840
But, Dad,
Sebastian is still here.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.840
He'll come after you.
I'll be fine.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.800
Besides, you'll find a way
to get me back in no time.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.230
(panting rapidly)

25:42.680 --> 25:45.350
I'm so sorry. I never
should have...

25:45.350 --> 25:46.810
It's okay. I love you.

25:52.650 --> 25:55.490
(low growling)

26:08.130 --> 26:09.880
LANDON:
You don't have to do this.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.920
Dorian, stop. This isn't you.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.510
I know, but I can't stop.

26:13.510 --> 26:15.090
Well, then you must
have been compelled.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.470
Wha-- what did
they say to you?

26:16.470 --> 26:18.140
What exactly did
they tell you to do?

26:18.140 --> 26:19.970
I have to take you
to the boulders and hold you

26:19.970 --> 26:21.470
while they shoot
the golden arrow.

26:21.470 --> 26:23.310
What?

26:23.310 --> 26:25.350
Maybe help is on the way.

26:25.350 --> 26:27.310
(panting)

26:37.740 --> 26:40.450
KAI:
You'll never make it
to both places in time.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.960
You can't save them all.
Who's it gonna be?

26:51.540 --> 26:53.550
(chanting in foreign language)

27:02.430 --> 27:04.180
Don't!

27:05.180 --> 27:06.770
You really are a basic witch.

27:06.770 --> 27:08.230
Alyssa, please.

27:08.230 --> 27:10.980
I don't want them back.
Not now, not ever.

27:10.980 --> 27:12.570
If you finish that spell,
you'll kill them all.

27:12.570 --> 27:14.570
He didn't say anything
about that.

27:14.570 --> 27:16.240
Well, think about it.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.910
If you sever the connection,
the prison world collapses.

27:18.910 --> 27:20.740
Everyone in it will die.

27:22.740 --> 27:25.580
Look, I know that
you're angry,

27:25.580 --> 27:27.830
and I know that you
want to hurt them.

27:30.330 --> 27:31.960
But you're not a murderer.

27:33.710 --> 27:37.130
Trust me, you don't want to be
responsible for someone's death.

27:37.130 --> 27:39.630
It stays with you.

27:39.630 --> 27:42.550
You carry it forever.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.940
I know.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.860
(clicking)

27:59.860 --> 28:01.160
That isn't me.

28:07.410 --> 28:09.000
It's not too late.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.790
Dorian, you can fight this.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.170
I'm sorry, Landon.

28:15.630 --> 28:17.960
I promised I'd
keep you safe.

28:21.550 --> 28:23.510
But I have to hold you
while they shoot the arrow.

28:23.510 --> 28:24.800
(whimpers)

28:24.800 --> 28:27.430
I have to. I have to hold you.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.480
(panting)

28:33.980 --> 28:35.110
(shouts)

28:40.110 --> 28:41.780
(sighs)

28:56.090 --> 28:57.500
You-You-You'll be okay.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.130
I'll go get help.

28:59.130 --> 29:00.510
You'll be okay.

29:00.510 --> 29:02.340
You won't make it in time.

29:02.340 --> 29:03.720
Just stay with me.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.510
Okay.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.430
(groaning)

29:13.640 --> 29:14.900
Landon?

29:14.900 --> 29:16.440
It's all right.

29:16.440 --> 29:19.690
It's not your fault, all right?

29:19.690 --> 29:22.860
No matter what happens,
you're still one of the heroes.

29:22.860 --> 29:25.450
Okay.
You hear me?

29:26.490 --> 29:28.580
No matter what.

29:28.580 --> 29:30.490
Okay.

29:33.710 --> 29:35.500
(whooshing lightly)

29:38.710 --> 29:40.760
No. Mr. Williams?

29:40.760 --> 29:43.470
(panting)

29:50.850 --> 29:53.390
Holy crap. It worked.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.520
I'll get you out,
I promise.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.110
I know you will.

30:01.110 --> 30:03.190
Now you got to go!

30:08.120 --> 30:10.530
(Diego growls, Alaric groans)

30:12.950 --> 30:14.660
I will never forgive you.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.140
It's like I was

30:29.140 --> 30:31.310
trying to tell you
the night that you shot me.

30:32.970 --> 30:37.230
Some people don't know what
to do with a second chance.

30:37.230 --> 30:39.610
Thank you.

30:39.610 --> 30:41.610
I put Elizabeth in danger.

30:41.610 --> 30:45.530
If you wish to thank me,
take care of her.

30:56.410 --> 30:59.330
(exhales)

30:59.330 --> 31:03.000
So, how exactly
do we do this?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.050
You touch me
and become the anchor.

31:05.050 --> 31:07.130
Okay. Um...

31:10.260 --> 31:12.850
Can you tell
your sister...

31:15.560 --> 31:18.270
...something a better man
would say?

It's me, guys.

31:52.850 --> 31:53.890
I'm back.

31:59.640 --> 32:00.560
Landon's in trouble.

32:09.070 --> 32:10.820
What happened?

32:10.820 --> 32:12.700
I had to make a choice.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.700
And...

32:14.700 --> 32:16.910
I didn't choose Landon.

32:18.450 --> 32:20.460
But it's okay

32:20.460 --> 32:22.630
because he's gonna come out
any second,

32:22.630 --> 32:23.630
and-and if I...

32:24.670 --> 32:26.550
When I open my eyes,

32:26.550 --> 32:28.210
he's gonna be there.
