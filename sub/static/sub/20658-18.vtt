This puppy has gotten me kicked
out of a lot of taquerias.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.381
The fact is building a wall
would actually

01:53.381 --> 01:56.150
increase the number of illegal
immigrants in America.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.051
What?
How could it possibly?

01:58.051 --> 01:59.387
Here, I'll show you.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.494
Just building a wall would

This is where it would be.

02:09.730 --> 02:10.664

It would have to stretch over
2,000 miles of rough terrain...

cutting through mountains,

02:20.508 --> 02:23.511
rivers, villages

02:23.511 --> 02:25.746
and even people's homes.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.488
And all that destruction
is monstrously expensive.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.823
Just building the wall

02:35.823 --> 02:39.260
would cost between
$15 and $25 billion.

expensive pieces of
infrastructure

as much as 20 Hoover Dams

That's one small step for man,

02:59.913 --> 03:02.883

the astronomical cost

03:07.521 --> 03:09.257
which taxpayers like you
and your children

03:09.257 --> 03:11.292
will be stuck paying forever.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.793
I paid for the wall.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.895
My father's father
paid for the wall.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.866
And one day you
will pay for the wall.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.469

03:23.471 --> 03:25.873
Even just faking
the wall for our show

03:25.873 --> 03:29.310
was prohibitively expensive.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.579
Looks like our CGI
budget ran out.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.147
Okay, yes,
it may be expensive

03:34.147 --> 03:35.316
but that doesn't change the fact

03:35.316 --> 03:37.318
that once we build it,
it will work.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.652
Not like you think.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.721
Increasing security
at the border

03:40.721 --> 03:42.590

03:43.991 --> 03:45.459
No one's getting passed me.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.461
Yes, they are because
it's estimated that

03:47.461 --> 03:50.831
between 27% and 40% of all
undocumented immigrants

03:50.831 --> 03:53.601
in America
came here on planes.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.836
(plane passing)

03:55.836 --> 03:57.671
I forgot about planes.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.773
These immigrants didn't
sneak over the border.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.510
They came here legally
through passport control,

04:02.510 --> 04:04.244
then just overstayed
their visas.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.013
And guess what?
A border wall's

04:06.013 --> 04:08.148
not gonna stop 'em
because, reminder...

04:11.819 --> 04:13.120
You fools!

04:13.120 --> 04:15.623
You forgot about planes!

04:15.623 --> 04:19.360
We always forget about planes!

04:19.360 --> 04:22.095
Even by your estimate
of visa overstays,

04:22.095 --> 04:24.298
the wall would still
stop about half

04:24.298 --> 04:26.367
of America's 11 million
illegal immigrants.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.668
No, it wouldn't.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.603
'Cause of a little something
called circular flow.

Here, I'll show you.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.872
(dog yelps)

04:31.872 --> 04:36.043
For decades, immigration
to the U.S. was a circular flow.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.678
People would come,
work for a bit

04:37.678 --> 04:40.614
and then after they were done,
go home to their families.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.782
Meet Douglas Massey.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.618
Thanks, Adam.

tired waiting for my cue.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.288
He's a professor at Princeton

04:48.288 --> 04:50.491
and a pioneering
researcher on this topic.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.660
When the Reagan, Bush
and Clinton administrations

04:52.660 --> 04:53.794
drastically increased border

04:53.794 --> 04:54.895
enforcement in response

04:54.895 --> 04:55.996
to public opinion,

04:55.996 --> 04:57.998
they stopped that circular flow.

04:57.998 --> 05:01.402
Not by keeping people out,
but by keeping people in.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.537
(Douglas)
As it got harder and harder
to go back and forth,

05:03.537 --> 05:04.905
people crossing
the border decided

05:04.905 --> 05:07.341
they were much better off
just staying in the U.S.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.913
If I go back to Mexico now,

05:12.913 --> 05:15.816
he won't let me back
in the U.S.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.852
I guess I'll just stay here...
in Tucson.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.890
Ironically, this increase
in border enforcement

05:22.890 --> 05:24.758
caused the number of
undocumented immigrants

05:24.758 --> 05:28.529
living in the United States
to skyrocket by 248%.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.764
It's counterintuitive,
but building a wall

05:30.764 --> 05:32.433
wouldn't stop people
from coming in.

05:32.433 --> 05:35.335
It would actually stop them
from going back.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.371
In fact, the whole idea of
building a border wall

05:37.371 --> 05:38.672
is misguided.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.041
The Mexican economy is doing
quite well right now

05:41.041 --> 05:43.777
and population growth
has slowed way down.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.613
So, there's not much
pressure to emigrate.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.448
The number of illegal
border crossings

05:47.448 --> 05:49.950
is actually at an all-time low.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.353
If you're a professor,
then why are you in the desert?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.356
I'm not, I'm a mirage.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.525

06:04.798 --> 06:08.135

any two nations at peace.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.369
So, the real issue
of immigration

06:09.369 --> 06:11.304
isn't the people coming in.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.474
The fact is,
they're already here.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.109
Nearly one out of every
30 people in America

06:16.109 --> 06:17.745
is an unauthorized immigrant.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.982

the U.S. straight up attacked

square miles of their land

and implement Operation Wetback.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.411
What?!

10:44.411 --> 10:45.545
That's an awful slur.

Eh, we're fickle.
Get out!

10:55.889 --> 10:57.424
(man grunts)

10:57.424 --> 11:00.027
Not only were these programs
explicitly racist,

11:00.027 --> 11:03.731
they were a human
rights disaster.

11:03.731 --> 11:07.000
Thousands of families were
detained and separated.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.435
They were crowded onto boats

11:08.435 --> 11:11.671
described as 18th century
slave ships.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.707
And those who went
by sea were lucky.

11:13.707 --> 11:17.044
88 braceros died after being
left in the desert.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.413
Not only was this program
unconscionably inhumane,

11:20.413 --> 11:23.283
it destroyed the image of
America as a bastion

11:23.283 --> 11:24.684
of freedom and equality

11:24.684 --> 11:27.287
for a generation of
Mexican-Americans.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.622
Oh, please don't yell at me,
I have an inner ear infection.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.895
Let me be very clear,

11:34.895 --> 11:37.297
these mass
deportation programs

11:37.297 --> 11:40.467
are one of the most shameful
chapters in America's history.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.935
They solved nothing.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.405
Their only outcome
was suffering and death.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.877
Ah, mi hija.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.979
I don't understand.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.447
This is a great country.
How could this happen?

11:54.447 --> 11:57.050
Great countries make mistakes.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.219
True greatness
is in not repeating them.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.721

No, this is a mistake.

of it that are messed up,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.628
the entire system is one big
judicial garbage fire.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.530
But Abuela didn't
come here illegally.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.866
She just lost her paperwork.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.633
Right.
All kinds of people

13:20.633 --> 13:22.235
are scooped up
into these courts.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.504
Some were apprehended at the
border or committed a crime,

13:24.504 --> 13:26.974
others were picked up
for a minor traffic violation.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.376
And some just lost
their paperwork.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.379
I came here to study finance,
but I lost my passport

13:32.379 --> 13:33.480
at the Burning Man.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.982
Some came here legally.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.383
Others not so much.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.219
The purpose of this court
is to determine which is which.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.820
See, Abuela, I'm sure
they're gonna see

13:40.820 --> 13:42.255
that you deserve
to be here.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.391
Here's the problem,
less than 2%

13:44.391 --> 13:46.493
of what we spend
on immigration annually

13:46.493 --> 13:48.996
is devoted to these courts.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.330
Sorry.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.001
There are just 57 immigration
courts across the U.S.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.168
Think about that.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.837
We have 30 times
as many Radio Shacks

13:57.837 --> 13:59.572
as we do immigration courts.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.344
And there are definitely more
folks with immigration problems

14:04.344 --> 14:06.779
then there are people who
need Blackberry holsters.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.682
The immigration courts currently
have an insane backlog of

14:09.682 --> 14:12.519
489,000 cases.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.687
(Cajun accent)
Hot dang!
Boy, that's a number

14:14.687 --> 14:16.856
higher than the population
of New Orleans.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.192
Wait, a Cajun guy?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.361
You're an American.
Why are you here?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.296
Chere baby, they don't
understand me when I talk.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.966
They think I'm
speaking the French.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.300
Oh, yeah.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.102
Now you see that I'm dealing
with there, boy.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.437
Sure, they think
that's it all right.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.805
I'm just a man trying
to raise a family

14:32.805 --> 14:34.374
on $2.50 a month.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.276
Come on, chere baby...

14:36.276 --> 14:39.446
This underfunded system has
so few immigration judges

14:39.446 --> 14:42.782
that each one handles
1,500 cases a year.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.552
And unlike regular judges,
they can actually be fired

14:45.552 --> 14:47.254
for not working fast enough.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.922
Deported. (gavel bangs)
Deported. (gavel bangs)

14:48.922 --> 14:50.557
Deported. (gavel bangs)
Deported. (gavel bangs)

14:50.557 --> 14:52.292
Deported. (gavel bangs)
Deported. (gavel bangs)

14:52.292 --> 14:53.994
(muffled) Deported.
(gavel bangs)
Deported. (gavel bangs)

14:53.994 --> 14:55.662
Deported. (gavel banging)
Deported. Deported.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.330
Deported. Deported.
Deported. Deported...

14:57.330 --> 14:59.732
Even worse the vast majority
of respondents

14:59.732 --> 15:02.169
go through this system
without a lawyer.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.937
Wait, what about
public defenders?

15:03.937 --> 15:06.473
Nope, unlike regular,
or lets be frank...

15:06.473 --> 15:09.909
real courts, immigration courts
do not provide lawyers,

15:09.909 --> 15:12.479
even to unaccompanied minors.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.647
Children? They don't give
lawyers to children?

15:14.647 --> 15:17.450
(baby cooing)

15:17.450 --> 15:19.419
Objection overruled.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.254
(cooing)
Sustained.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.424
One more outburst
and I'm having you detained.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.261
Not to mention the severe
language barrier.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.364
In some cases, interpreters are
only available over the phone.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.300
(man on phone speaking Spanish)

15:35.602 --> 15:36.836
What'd she say?

15:36.836 --> 15:38.271
(man on phone)
Uh, something about Nintendo.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.807
This is Xbox country.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.109
Deport her.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.779
This has to be an exaggeration.
It can't possibly be this bad.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.982
No, often it's much worse.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.218
Some detention centers
are so remote,

15:51.218 --> 15:53.786
defendants can't even be
physically present in court,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.188
so the government
conducts hearings

15:55.188 --> 15:57.624
via Skype or televideo.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.959
I ha-- Ameri-- citizensh--

15:59.959 --> 16:01.461
Should I reboot her?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.463
No, just deport her.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.531
What?
Wait-wait-wait!

16:04.531 --> 16:06.333
Wait! No-no-no-no! No!

16:06.333 --> 16:08.135
Think about it,
that means you can have

16:08.135 --> 16:10.470
a hearing where the judge
is in the courtroom,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.205
the translator is talking
over the phone,

16:12.205 --> 16:14.807
and the defendant
is on a webcam.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.244
This is really happening in
immigration courtrooms

16:17.244 --> 16:20.180
all across
America as we speak.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.882
And it's no surprise that under
this cacamany process,

16:22.882 --> 16:25.885
huge mistakes
happen constantly.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.358
Meet Professor Jackie Stevens.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.526
She works closely with people
trapped in this system.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.661
Reporting on their stories

16:34.661 --> 16:36.329
and connecting them
with legal counsel.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.531
Thanks, Adam.
Gabby, this system regularly

16:38.531 --> 16:41.034
deports American citizens.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.436
American citizens?
Really?

16:43.436 --> 16:45.172
Yes.
In fact, in 2009,

16:45.172 --> 16:47.340
I got to know a man
named Mark Lyttle.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.210
He is a U.S. citizen with
mental disabilities

16:50.210 --> 16:53.346
who was deported in what
was called a mass removal.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.782
The judge asked a group
of 30 men over televideo

16:55.782 --> 16:58.518
to raise their hands if they
objected to being deported.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.920
The judge recorded
seeing no hands.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.422
When he later told
them that he was born

17:02.422 --> 17:04.757
in North Carolina,
no one listened.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.594
(Jackie)
He was deported to Mexico
where officials there

17:07.594 --> 17:09.529
discovered he wasn't
a Mexican citizen.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.299
He was deported, yet again,
to Honduras.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.367
And they deported
him to Guatemala.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.071
Police in Guatemala finally
found Mark Lyttle

17:18.071 --> 17:21.441
sleeping on a park bench
thousands of miles from home.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.610
Ah, so he finally
got to go home right?

17:23.610 --> 17:26.479
(Jackie)
Yes, but when he
arrived in Atlanta,

17:26.479 --> 17:28.047
they detained him again.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.582
That's awful.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.118
Yes, and shockingly common.

17:31.118 --> 17:34.621
According to my research, more
than 20,000 U.S. citizens

17:34.621 --> 17:37.757
have been detained or deported
since 2003.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.060
20,000...
citizens?

17:41.060 --> 17:44.797
Yes. The system
is so broken that-- to this--

17:44.797 --> 17:45.965
deported-- (video glitching)

17:48.635 --> 17:52.472
This system is so broken,
natural born American citizens

17:52.472 --> 17:56.309
like you and me are
deported all the time.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.977
Whether you're conservative,

17:57.977 --> 18:00.113
or liberal,
or somewhere in between,

18:00.113 --> 18:02.449
you have to face the fact that
what our immigration system

18:02.449 --> 18:06.453
does to people is contrary to
every American value.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.924
♪♪

18:11.924 --> 18:14.026
If even I could be...

18:14.026 --> 18:16.363
what chance does
my abuela have?

18:21.601 --> 18:24.371
I'm so sorry.
I'll do anything I can to help.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.705
My sister's a lawyer.

18:25.705 --> 18:26.773
I'm not sure what type, but...

18:26.773 --> 18:29.108
I'm sure she could
suggest somebody.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.145
What's the point?
Why even stay in America?

18:32.145 --> 18:33.112
What?

18:46.058 --> 18:49.496
I didn't quite follow that,
but it sounded really sad.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.868
(speaking Spanish)

20:15.147 --> 20:17.917
Yes, I think I do.

20:17.917 --> 20:21.254
We are Americans
and it's up to us to stay

20:21.254 --> 20:23.055
and make this country
a better place.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.624
Muy bien.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.093
You're right, Abuela.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.829
I'm going to take some
courses in immigration law.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.732
We're going to get the money
together and hire a lawyer.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.501
We're gonna fix this,
whatever it takes.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.269
I promise.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.472
And... thanks, Adam.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.575
This hasn't been easy, but we
really appreciate your help.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.311
Wow, I'm honored.

20:44.311 --> 20:47.079
Now, could you hold
for room tone?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.080
No?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.416
Okay, well, good luck.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.752
You know, amigo,
you explain things well.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.621
Not with my flare
of course.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.323
Thank you, Alfonso.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.257
Vamanos.
There's work to be done.

21:00.293 --> 21:05.765
Ah... Adam.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.766
What?!
