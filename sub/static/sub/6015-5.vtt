00:04.033 --> 00:06.593
I have never seen an old person
in a new bathing suit...

00:06.753 --> 00:09.711
...in my life. I don't know where
they get their bathing suits.

00:10.273 --> 00:12.992
But my father has bathing suits
from other centuries.

00:13.153 --> 00:14.506
My parents live in Florida.

00:14.673 --> 00:17.471
And if you go down there and
you forget your bathing suit...

00:17.633 --> 00:20.022
...then they want you
to wear one of theirs.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.672
You know how that gets?

00:21.833 --> 00:24.631
"You need trunks, son?
I got trunks for you.

00:24.793 --> 00:26.590
You can wear my trunks."

00:26.753 --> 00:29.347
Fathers don't wear bathing
suits, they wear trunks.

00:29.513 --> 00:32.903
It's kind of the same thing a tree
would wear if it went swimming.

00:33.433 --> 00:36.789
So I get in the water in this thing,
and it's, like, floating around me...

00:36.953 --> 00:38.705
...somewhere.

00:38.873 --> 00:41.148
You ever put on a bathing suit
that you don't know...

00:41.313 --> 00:43.383
...exactly where you are
inside the bathing suit?

00:43.553 --> 00:45.703
You bump into somebody,
"No, I'm parasailing.

00:45.873 --> 00:47.784
I'm waiting for the boat
to come back."

00:53.873 --> 00:56.103
It was supposed to be here at 7:30.

00:56.273 --> 00:58.912
- Call the airlines again.
- What happened to the Scotch tape?

00:59.073 --> 01:00.552
Who takes the Scotch tape?

01:00.713 --> 01:03.147
Nobody returns anything
around here.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.825
Oh, I think that's them.

01:04.992 --> 01:06.551
Know what I'll do next time?

01:06.713 --> 01:08.192
I'll hide it so nobody can find it.

01:10.673 --> 01:12.186
- Hi! Welcome!
- Hi!

01:12.353 --> 01:13.832
- Welcome.
- How are you?

01:13.993 --> 01:17.190
- Welcome to Florida!
- Hi, Mr. Seinfeld.

01:17.353 --> 01:19.628
Hey, there's the old man.

01:19.793 --> 01:22.148
So, what took you so long?

01:22.313 --> 01:24.747
We waited 35 minutes
in the rent-a-car place.

01:24.913 --> 01:27.063
I don't know why.
We would have picked you up.

01:27.233 --> 01:29.383
- What's the difference?
- You could use our car.

01:29.553 --> 01:30.986
I don't want to use your car.

01:31.153 --> 01:33.189
- What's wrong with our car?
- Nothing. It's fine.

01:33.353 --> 01:35.071
- What if you want to use it?
- We don't.

01:35.233 --> 01:37.952
- What? We use it.
- lf you were using it, we wouldn't.

01:38.113 --> 01:39.341
So, what, you'd hitch?

01:39.513 --> 01:41.947
- How much is a rent-a-car?
- I don't know, 25 bucks a day.

01:42.113 --> 01:44.991
- What? Oh, you're crazy.
- Plus the insurance.

01:45.153 --> 01:46.586
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

01:46.753 --> 01:48.903
How could you not
get the insurance?

01:49.353 --> 01:50.547
We'll pay for the car.

01:50.713 --> 01:52.749
- You're not paying for it.
- Morty.

01:53.913 --> 01:55.790
God, it's so hot in here.

01:57.513 --> 01:59.265
Why don't you put on
the air conditioning?

01:59.433 --> 02:03.062
You don't need the air conditioner.
Do you have your speech all ready?

02:03.233 --> 02:04.825
Do I have to make a speech?

02:04.993 --> 02:07.632
Of course. They're giving
a testimonial for your father.

02:07.793 --> 02:09.863
- You could do your comic routines.
- Oh, yeah.

02:10.032 --> 02:12.672
That'll go over real well
with that crowd.

02:12.913 --> 02:14.505
You have a lake.

02:14.833 --> 02:16.585
- The lake isn't real.
- The lake is real.

02:16.753 --> 02:18.345
Are you kidding? They built the lake.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.027
But it's real, it's water.

02:21.913 --> 02:24.825
- Where are you going with those?
- I'll put Elaine's stuff in here.

02:24.993 --> 02:26.824
Don't sleep in there.
Sleep in the bedroom.

02:27.273 --> 02:28.592
I can't take your bedroom.

02:28.753 --> 02:31.870
- I'm up at 6:00 in the morning.
- I can't kick you out of your bed.

02:32.033 --> 02:34.024
We don't even sleep.

02:34.473 --> 02:36.589
- Ma.
- It's a sofa bed.

02:36.753 --> 02:38.664
- You'll be uncomfortable.
- What about you?

02:38.833 --> 02:40.027
Why should I be comfortable?

02:41.273 --> 02:43.343
- What about him?
- Don't worry. He's comfortable.

02:43.513 --> 02:45.469
I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.

02:46.673 --> 02:49.949
- Will you stop?
- Yeah, I'll just stay in here.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.431
Jerry.

02:55.193 --> 02:57.946
Jerry, you don't have to stay
on the couch on my account.

02:58.113 --> 03:00.991
- You two can stay in there together.
- That's not a good idea.

03:01.153 --> 03:03.872
- I thought that you...
- Not now. She's right inside.

03:04.033 --> 03:05.386
What happened?

03:05.633 --> 03:08.431
I don't know. We decided we
don't really work as a couple.

03:08.793 --> 03:10.829
- What does that mean?
- Well...

03:10.993 --> 03:12.824
Why are you whispering?

03:13.353 --> 03:15.309
- Nothing, nothing.
- Elaine.

03:15.473 --> 03:17.429
- What about her?
- Would you please be...?

03:19.033 --> 03:21.786
You know, look at the
sun-dried tomatoes.

03:21.953 --> 03:24.148
Where were they five years ago?

03:24.313 --> 03:26.668
It just goes to show you,
you never know what...

03:26.913 --> 03:29.063
What, you know, could happen...

03:29.513 --> 03:32.823
...to a vegetable. It could just
take right off at any time.

03:36.193 --> 03:37.945
We've tried all kinds
of arrangements...

03:38.113 --> 03:40.752
...but we can't seem to be friends
when we sleep together.

03:40.993 --> 03:43.427
Why do you need more friends?

03:43.593 --> 03:45.072
You've got plenty of friends.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.351
- He's an idealist.
- What are you looking for?

03:48.593 --> 03:51.027
- I'm looking. I like looking.
- He likes looking.

03:51.193 --> 03:52.706
- So look.
- But how long can you look?

03:52.873 --> 03:54.864
I'm going for the record.

03:56.993 --> 03:59.632
Your father wouldn't say so,
but he's really glad you came.

03:59.793 --> 04:01.704
- Oh, come on.
- This is a big thing for him.

04:01.873 --> 04:04.262
Outgoing president
of the condo association.

04:08.033 --> 04:10.422
So they arrived safely.

04:10.593 --> 04:12.948
- Remember Jack and Doris?
- Nice to see you.

04:13.113 --> 04:14.705
- This is Elaine.
- Hi.

04:14.873 --> 04:16.272
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Hello.

04:16.433 --> 04:18.185
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hey, Jerry...

04:18.353 --> 04:20.913
...you came all the way
down here for this?

04:21.072 --> 04:22.347
And scuba diving.

04:22.593 --> 04:24.424
Scuba diving?
Who's going scuba diving?

04:24.593 --> 04:26.424
We're going. We'll be back in time.

04:26.593 --> 04:28.311
What do you have to go
scuba diving for?

04:28.473 --> 04:30.270
- For fun.
- For fun?

04:30.433 --> 04:32.105
Jack, have some sponge cake.

04:33.033 --> 04:34.910
No. Thanks, no.

04:35.073 --> 04:36.267
Jack is emceeing tomorrow.

04:36.673 --> 04:39.745
- He's in charge of the whole thing.
- So, Jerry, your mother tells me...

04:39.913 --> 04:42.552
...you're gonna do one of your
little comedy skits tomorrow.

04:42.713 --> 04:45.147
- I don't think so.
- No?

04:45.313 --> 04:47.702
Listen, Morty, you want to
settle up for last night?

04:47.873 --> 04:52.822
All right. I owe you $19.45.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.063
What did you have?
You had the minute steak.

04:55.233 --> 04:56.825
- Yeah.
- Did you have a Coke or what?

04:56.993 --> 04:59.382
I did not have a Coke.

04:59.553 --> 05:00.747
Somebody had a Coke.

05:00.993 --> 05:02.824
- I had a Coke.
- Oh, and I had the scampi.

05:03.393 --> 05:06.863
So, that's $17.10,
and the tax and the tip.

05:07.233 --> 05:09.224
All right, make it 20 bucks.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.669
It's $19.45, Morty.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.391
$19.45?

05:14.753 --> 05:16.186
See, you know your father.

05:16.353 --> 05:18.389
You got to get it right
to the penny.

05:18.553 --> 05:20.987
But that's why he was
such a good president.

05:21.433 --> 05:22.707
Hey, what kind of pen is that?

05:24.193 --> 05:25.467
- This pen?
- Yeah.

05:25.633 --> 05:28.101
Oh, this is an astronaut pen.

05:28.353 --> 05:31.311
It writes upside down.
They use this in space.

05:31.473 --> 05:35.307
Oh, that's the astronaut pen. I heard
about that. Where did you get it?

05:35.793 --> 05:38.751
- It was a gift.
- Because a lot of times I write in bed...

05:38.913 --> 05:41.905
...and I have to turn and lean on
my elbow to make the pen work.

05:43.993 --> 05:45.392
- Take the pen.
- Oh, no.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.588
- Go ahead.
- I couldn't.

05:46.753 --> 05:47.902
- Take it.
- I can't take it.

05:48.073 --> 05:50.189
- Do me a personal favour.
- No, I'm not comfortable.

05:50.353 --> 05:52.150
- I cannot take it.
- Take the pen.

05:52.313 --> 05:55.350
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive. Take the pen.

05:55.873 --> 05:59.661
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you. Gee, boy.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.903
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Stop it.

06:02.073 --> 06:03.711
Jack, we should go.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.829
It was nice meeting you.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.392
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks again.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.072
Come on!

06:11.233 --> 06:13.110
She's adorable.

06:17.233 --> 06:18.552
What did you take his pen for?

06:20.313 --> 06:22.588
- He gave it to me.
- But you didn't have to take it.

06:22.753 --> 06:24.869
She's gotta make a big deal
out of everything.

06:25.033 --> 06:27.786
- He offered it to me.
- Because you made such a big fuss.

06:27.953 --> 06:30.342
Well, I liked it. Should I
have said I didn't like it?

06:30.513 --> 06:33.107
You shouldn't have said anything.
What did you expect?

06:33.273 --> 06:36.026
He could have said, "Thank you,"
and put it back in his pocket.

06:36.193 --> 06:38.866
- He loves that pen.
- Come on.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.786
He talks about it all the time.
He goes on and on...

06:41.953 --> 06:44.467
...about how it writes upside down,
how astronauts use it.

06:44.633 --> 06:46.271
He never should have offered it.

06:46.433 --> 06:49.231
- He didn't think you'd accept.
- Well, he was wrong.

06:50.353 --> 06:52.992
I know his wife.
She has some mouth on her.

06:53.153 --> 06:56.429
She'll tell everyone in the condo now
that you made him give you the pen.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.664
They're talking about it right now.

06:58.913 --> 07:01.222
- So you want me to return it?
- Yes.

07:01.393 --> 07:03.623
He's not gonna return that pen.
That's ridiculous.

07:03.793 --> 07:05.385
I don't even want the pen now.

07:05.553 --> 07:08.351
Jack can afford to give away a pen
with all his money, believe me.

07:08.513 --> 07:11.027
He gives me a check for $19.45.

07:11.193 --> 07:13.753
He didn't have a Coke.

07:15.433 --> 07:17.310
Here, let me see it.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.545
- Hey, it writes upside down.
- Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:32.913 --> 07:34.790
Come in.

07:36.553 --> 07:37.952
You okay in here?

07:39.193 --> 07:42.026
Why is it so hot in here?

07:43.233 --> 07:44.905
How can they sleep like this?

07:45.073 --> 07:46.631
It's only for three days.

07:46.793 --> 07:48.465
Today's over.
Then we have tomorrow.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.545
We leave on Sunday.
It's one day, really.

07:54.313 --> 07:56.827
What is with this bar?

07:57.513 --> 07:59.788
It's right in my back. It's killing me.

07:59.953 --> 08:01.864
You wanna switch?
I'm on a love seat.

08:02.033 --> 08:05.343
I got my feet up in the air
like I'm in a space capsule.

08:06.113 --> 08:07.671
I am never gonna fall asleep.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.222
Oh, no, don't say that.
You'll jinx me.

08:11.873 --> 08:14.103
How can they not put
the air conditioning on?

08:14.273 --> 08:16.423
They're nuts with temperature.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.631
This bar is right in my back.

08:23.873 --> 08:25.989
It's making a dent.

08:28.113 --> 08:32.664
How about that guy
writing a check for $19.45?

08:33.472 --> 08:34.905
I'm sweating here.

08:35.793 --> 08:38.751
I'm in bed, sweating.

08:39.073 --> 08:40.664
It's one day.

08:40.993 --> 08:42.745
Half a day, really.

08:43.073 --> 08:47.225
I mean, you subtract showers
and meals, it's like 20 minutes.

08:47.513 --> 08:49.469
It'll go by like that.

08:50.753 --> 08:53.950
Stay on 95 South
to Biscayne Boulevard.

08:55.353 --> 08:56.502
Then you make a left turn.

08:57.073 --> 09:00.145
Put your blinker on immediately,
there's an abutment there.

09:00.313 --> 09:03.385
Then you're gonna merge over
very quickly, but stay on Biscayne.

09:03.553 --> 09:05.305
Don't get off Biscayne,
you understand me?

09:05.473 --> 09:07.350
Stay on Biscayne.

09:08.193 --> 09:09.626
You're going underwater?

09:09.793 --> 09:12.626
Yes, generally, that's where
scuba diving is done.

09:12.913 --> 09:15.711
What do you have to go for?
What's down there that's so special?

09:16.833 --> 09:18.551
What's so special up here?

09:21.193 --> 09:22.387
What's the matter?

09:22.553 --> 09:24.942
- My back.
- What happened?

09:25.113 --> 09:26.512
That... That bed.

09:26.673 --> 09:28.982
The bar was right in my back.

09:29.153 --> 09:31.109
I told you to let us sleep in there.

09:31.273 --> 09:32.945
Then you would be hunched over.

09:33.953 --> 09:36.421
I don't even know if
I can go scuba diving.

09:36.593 --> 09:38.823
- You can't go?
- So stay home.

09:39.353 --> 09:41.105
- You can go.
- Without you?

09:41.273 --> 09:42.672
That's the reason you came down.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.630
- Don't go.
- You sure?

09:44.793 --> 09:46.067
Maybe you should see a doctor.

09:46.313 --> 09:48.827
- We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
- No, we'll stay in there.

09:48.993 --> 09:50.267
Why don't you get a new sofa?

09:50.753 --> 09:52.584
Nobody uses it.

09:52.953 --> 09:54.591
I'm buying you a new sofa.

09:54.753 --> 09:56.072
Jerry, don't talk crazy.

09:56.233 --> 09:58.110
Mrs. Seinfeld, please...

09:58.353 --> 10:00.309
...I am begging you:

10:00.473 --> 10:04.386
Put the air conditioner on.

10:07.713 --> 10:09.305
You're hot?

10:10.593 --> 10:13.153
I've lost six pounds.

10:13.593 --> 10:15.185
I don't even know how to work it.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.742
I keep telling her
it's like an oven in here.

10:19.393 --> 10:20.667
Is everybody up?

10:20.833 --> 10:22.505
Hi, how are you?

10:22.673 --> 10:24.106
Hello, Jerry.

10:24.273 --> 10:25.752
Evelyn, this is Elaine.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.187
Hi, Evelyn.

10:28.673 --> 10:30.789
Jerry, you got thin.

10:30.993 --> 10:32.506
- Too thin?
- Oh, stop worrying...

10:32.673 --> 10:34.106
...so much about how you look.

10:36.153 --> 10:37.905
So where's the new pen?

10:47.193 --> 10:49.070
- What?
- The pen.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.189
The one Jack Klompus gave you.

10:51.553 --> 10:53.908
- How did you know that?
- Blanche told me.

10:54.073 --> 10:57.588
- Blanche?
- That's some good pen.

10:57.753 --> 11:00.870
- Writes upside down.
- Yeah.

11:01.593 --> 11:04.665
- The astronauts use them.
- What did Blanche say?

11:04.833 --> 11:07.188
I don't know, she said
Jerry wanted the pen.

11:07.353 --> 11:09.423
I never really wanted the pen.

11:09.593 --> 11:11.390
- He gave him the pen.
- Morty.

11:11.553 --> 11:14.113
- Why? You don't like the pen?
- No, no, l...

11:14.273 --> 11:16.184
Because if you don't,
give it back to him.

11:16.353 --> 11:18.230
- Is that what she said?
- Who?

11:18.393 --> 11:20.509
- Blanche.
- What are you talking about?

11:23.593 --> 11:24.787
Hello?

11:24.953 --> 11:27.706
Oh, hello, Gussy. What?

11:27.873 --> 11:31.070
Jerry wouldn't do that.
Jack gave it to him.

11:32.513 --> 11:35.232
All he said was he liked it.

11:35.393 --> 11:37.349
I mean, nobody put
a gun to his head.

11:37.513 --> 11:40.027
You're giving him back that pen.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.426
Somebody, please.

11:43.593 --> 11:45.231
The air conditioner.

11:45.553 --> 11:47.191
Oh, my God, I forgot all about it.

11:47.353 --> 11:50.982
All I said was, "I like the pen."

11:51.793 --> 11:54.102
How the hell do you
work this thing?

11:57.593 --> 11:59.868
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

12:00.033 --> 12:01.989
Oh, no, no, I wanna go.

12:02.153 --> 12:03.552
But your back hurts.

12:03.713 --> 12:05.908
Maybe a couple of muscle
relaxers would help.

12:06.273 --> 12:07.831
Oh, okay.

12:10.193 --> 12:12.343
You can turn down the air
conditioning if you want.

12:12.513 --> 12:14.231
No, I'm fine.

12:14.673 --> 12:17.312
- You're not too cold?
- No.

12:18.793 --> 12:21.466
- Don't be alarmed.
- Oh, my God.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.510
- What the hell happened to you?
- I'm okay.

12:23.673 --> 12:26.233
- My capillaries burst.
- Your capillaries?

12:26.393 --> 12:28.907
- Do you know what you look like?
- How you doing?

12:29.073 --> 12:30.745
Having a good time.

12:30.913 --> 12:33.302
Is it my imagination
or is it freezing in here?

12:33.473 --> 12:34.906
What happened to your eyes?

12:35.073 --> 12:37.633
- Well, I started to go under...
- With the instructor?

12:37.793 --> 12:39.226
Yeah, I got about 10 feet down...

12:39.393 --> 12:42.066
...and felt this tremendous
pressure on my mask...

12:42.233 --> 12:45.066
...like my eyeballs were being
sucked out of their sockets.

12:45.233 --> 12:46.461
I told you.

12:46.753 --> 12:48.186
Excuse me.

12:48.353 --> 12:51.151
Doris would like to borrow
your red pocketbook...

12:51.313 --> 12:52.871
...to go with her shoes.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.830
The shoes have to match
the pocketbook.

12:55.753 --> 12:57.630
What's she doing, yoga?

12:58.313 --> 13:00.190
- My back hurts.
- Morty, better hurry up.

13:00.353 --> 13:02.264
- Get ready.
- We got plenty of time.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.503
- What happened?
- I got in a fistfight...

13:04.673 --> 13:06.948
...with one of the ladies at the pool.

13:07.433 --> 13:08.832
It's from scuba diving.

13:09.113 --> 13:10.592
What's there to see underwater?

13:10.913 --> 13:12.790
Listen, Mr. Klompus...

13:12.953 --> 13:16.832
...it was a nice gesture to give me
the pen, but I don't really need it.

13:17.993 --> 13:19.711
- You what?
- It's a terrific pen...

13:19.873 --> 13:21.431
...but I think you should keep it.

13:22.033 --> 13:23.705
- Well, I mean...
- Take it.

13:24.353 --> 13:25.911
All right.

13:26.073 --> 13:29.429
You know, Jack, you got a hell
of a nerve taking that kid's pen.

13:29.633 --> 13:31.066
- Whose pen?
- His pen.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.427
This happens to be my pen.

13:32.593 --> 13:35.187
- You didn't give it to him?
- What are you talking about?

13:35.353 --> 13:36.911
He practically begged me for it.

13:37.593 --> 13:39.106
Where do you come off
with this crap?

13:39.273 --> 13:42.185
Listen, do you think I take
everything everybody offers me?

13:42.513 --> 13:44.265
You offered me
sponge cake yesterday.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.230
- Did I take it?
- You didn't want it.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.465
Of course I wanted it!
I love sponge cake.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.271
Who said you couldn't have it?
I mean...

13:51.433 --> 13:53.788
...what the hell do I care whether
you have sponge cake?

13:53.953 --> 13:56.023
Because I saw the look
on your face last week...

13:56.193 --> 13:57.911
...when I took the Scotch tape.

13:58.353 --> 14:00.025
So you got the Scotch tape.

14:00.193 --> 14:02.502
- I've been looking all over for it.
- I'll give it back.

14:02.673 --> 14:04.584
- I don't want it.
- I don't want it!

14:05.593 --> 14:07.663
You know, Jack,
do me a favour, will you?

14:07.833 --> 14:11.030
Take the pen and the Scotch tape
and get the hell out of here.

14:11.193 --> 14:12.831
Listen, do you think I give a damn?

14:16.833 --> 14:19.506
Nerve of that guy,
taking back that pen.

14:19.673 --> 14:21.152
Well, that's it for them.

14:21.313 --> 14:24.749
What is going on
in this community?

14:25.153 --> 14:26.905
Are you people aware
of what's happening?

14:27.073 --> 14:29.428
What is driving you
to this behaviour?

14:29.593 --> 14:31.709
Is it the humidity? Is it the Muzak?

14:31.873 --> 14:33.704
Is it the white shoes?

14:34.273 --> 14:37.709
I have no use for either one of them.
I don't want them there tonight.

14:37.873 --> 14:39.192
Isn't he supposed to emcee?

14:39.553 --> 14:41.271
Yeah, he's supposed
to be the emcee.

14:41.953 --> 14:43.989
Well, this should be
a very interesting evening.

14:45.553 --> 14:48.829
What about those muscle relaxers?

14:52.633 --> 14:54.749
Say "astronaut."

14:55.513 --> 14:57.310
Say what?

14:57.833 --> 14:59.869
Say what?

15:00.033 --> 15:02.308
You took too many of those pills.

15:02.753 --> 15:04.505
- Astronaut?
- Say it.

15:04.673 --> 15:07.870
- Astronaut!
- Astro...

15:11.513 --> 15:12.662
Good. Okay.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.063
Last year, I took him
to the hospital every day.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.144
Did he ever say thank you?

15:17.313 --> 15:18.826
Oh, God.

15:18.993 --> 15:20.665
Uncle Leo.

15:21.753 --> 15:22.981
Hello!

15:24.633 --> 15:27.545
- Morty, are you nervous?
- What nervous?

15:27.713 --> 15:30.227
What's with the sunglasses?
Who are you, Van Johnson?

15:30.393 --> 15:31.542
I got a black eye.

15:32.313 --> 15:34.031
Hello.

15:34.593 --> 15:36.663
Oh, Elaine...

15:37.313 --> 15:38.746
...this is my Aunt Stella.

15:39.713 --> 15:41.749
Stella!

15:44.433 --> 15:46.424
Stella!

15:47.513 --> 15:49.583
Her back hurts.

15:52.113 --> 15:54.229
We saw you on
The Tonight Show last week.

15:54.393 --> 15:56.953
I thought Johnny
was very rude to you.

15:57.113 --> 16:00.105
- He didn't even let you talk.
- No, no.

16:00.273 --> 16:01.592
You need some new material.

16:01.753 --> 16:05.063
I've heard you do that
dog routine three times already.

16:05.713 --> 16:08.273
Stella!

16:08.633 --> 16:10.430
Stella!

16:11.833 --> 16:15.382
You should get your cousin Jeffrey
to write some material for you.

16:15.553 --> 16:18.113
What? Jeffrey works for
the Parks Department.

16:18.273 --> 16:20.582
You should read
the letters he's written.

16:20.753 --> 16:23.062
He's funnier than
the whole bunch of you.

16:23.353 --> 16:25.947
Oh, here's Jack.
We should sit down.

16:28.753 --> 16:32.063
This better be good.
I'm missing Golden Girls for this.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.387
I hate her like poison.

16:39.233 --> 16:41.349
Hey, Jack, let's get started.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.627
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you know...

16:49.993 --> 16:54.748
...every year, phase two
of the Pines of Mar Gables...

16:54.913 --> 16:57.632
...honours the previous
year's president.

16:57.793 --> 16:59.590
And this year, we are honouring...

16:59.753 --> 17:01.152
...Morty Seinfeld.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.031
Morty!

17:04.752 --> 17:09.304
A man who slept more hours
on the job than Ronald Reagan.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.864
Slept on the job?

17:14.032 --> 17:16.786
Being president of the condo
is not easy.

17:16.953 --> 17:20.069
It requires hard work, dedication,
and commitment.

17:20.233 --> 17:25.102
And unfortunately, he possesses
none of these qualities.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.465
I wonder what he ever did.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.544
He's joking.

17:31.713 --> 17:34.864
His administration did
excel in one department:

17:35.033 --> 17:37.467
The hiring of incompetents.

17:37.793 --> 17:39.590
That's what you say.

17:39.753 --> 17:42.711
But we do owe him
a debt of gratitude...

17:42.873 --> 17:46.422
...because by not fixing
the crack in the sidewalk...

17:46.593 --> 17:50.950
...it put Mrs. Ziven out of
commission for a few weeks.

17:52.073 --> 17:54.189
Tell them about when you
took my son's pen back.

17:54.353 --> 17:55.991
Tell them about that.

17:56.193 --> 17:57.467
Dad.

17:57.633 --> 18:00.147
He gave my son a pen,
and then he takes it back.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.871
- Tell them that!
- I took it back?

18:02.033 --> 18:04.183
- He gave it to me!
- That's enough. Sit down.

18:04.353 --> 18:06.867
- I'm not finished!
- Give me that microphone. Give it!

18:07.033 --> 18:09.422
- Morty, give me that.
- Give him the pen.

18:10.953 --> 18:13.148
You broke my dental plate.

18:13.633 --> 18:15.544
Doris! He broke my dental plate.

18:15.713 --> 18:17.863
You son of a bitch. I'll sue you.

18:18.033 --> 18:19.386
Jerry, do your act.

18:19.593 --> 18:21.390
I can't. Nobody's even listening.

18:21.553 --> 18:23.066
Well, they're all gonna leave.

18:23.513 --> 18:25.947
- I got witnesses here.
- Even your wife is on my side.

18:26.113 --> 18:28.149
How you folks doing tonight?

18:28.313 --> 18:31.669
Hey, have you ever noticed how they
give you the peanuts on the planes?

18:31.833 --> 18:34.552
- Not my Harry! He flies first class!
- Who thought the thing...

18:34.713 --> 18:36.908
...everybody wants on a plane
is a peanut?

18:37.073 --> 18:40.190
- I'd rather have a bottle of Scotch!
- Do the dog routine.

18:41.033 --> 18:44.105
All I said was, "I like the pen!"

18:46.073 --> 18:49.782
Stella!

18:50.873 --> 18:52.192
You could aggravate it.

18:52.873 --> 18:54.829
I wouldn't go anywhere
for at least five days.

18:55.313 --> 18:57.031
Five days?

18:57.193 --> 18:59.548
You want me to stay here
for five more days?

18:59.713 --> 19:01.465
There must be some mistake.

19:01.873 --> 19:03.386
I'm afraid not.

19:03.553 --> 19:05.623
Five days. Here.

19:05.913 --> 19:08.950
So we have you for five more days.

19:09.633 --> 19:12.022
There's no point in me staying.
You're just gonna be...

19:12.193 --> 19:13.706
Excuse me?

19:14.193 --> 19:15.672
Nothing.

19:17.313 --> 19:19.668
- Good morning.
- Hi, Evelyn.

19:19.913 --> 19:22.871
Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?

19:23.193 --> 19:25.343
- I don't think so.
- Because my nephew Larry...

19:25.513 --> 19:27.549
...could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer.

19:27.713 --> 19:29.749
He says Jack has no case.

19:29.993 --> 19:31.870
I'll ask him when he gets up.

19:32.033 --> 19:33.910
Oh, and I spoke to Arnold...

19:34.233 --> 19:38.624
...and he says that according to the
bylaws of the condo constitution...

19:38.793 --> 19:43.025
...they need six votes to throw you out
for unruly behaviour.

19:43.713 --> 19:44.987
Not five.

19:45.273 --> 19:47.946
Dr. Chernov is the one
you'll have to suck up to.

19:52.153 --> 19:53.506
Oh, my back.

19:53.673 --> 19:55.470
Oh, my back.

19:55.633 --> 19:58.750
That bar. Who the hell
could sleep on that thing?

19:59.073 --> 20:01.587
- I was very comfortable.
- Morty...

20:01.753 --> 20:04.825
...Arnold says they need
six votes to throw you out.

20:04.993 --> 20:06.392
It's in the constitution.

20:06.553 --> 20:09.431
- Who are you?
- I'm a chiropractor.

20:09.593 --> 20:11.823
What, are you kidding me?

20:12.793 --> 20:14.272
Five more days?

20:14.753 --> 20:19.463
Well, today's almost over,
and weekdays always go by fast.

20:19.633 --> 20:22.101
And Friday, we're leaving,
so it's like two days, really.

20:23.553 --> 20:25.589
It's like a cup of coffee.

20:25.953 --> 20:27.864
It'll go by like that.

20:28.473 --> 20:31.783
Is Florida not hot and muggy
enough for these people?

20:31.953 --> 20:33.432
They love heat.

20:33.593 --> 20:35.948
If they ever decide to
land men on the sun...

20:36.113 --> 20:38.866
...I think these old retired guys
will be the only ones...

20:39.033 --> 20:41.342
...that will be able to handle it.
They'll sit there...

20:41.513 --> 20:44.823
...on the redwood benches,
washcloth on their head, going:

20:45.273 --> 20:47.628
"I'm trying to get a sweat going."
