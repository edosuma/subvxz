<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:19.449
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:19.519 --> 00:22.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:22.622 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:41.072
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.910
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.978 --> 00:47.469

that his next leap...</i>

00:47.547 --> 00:49.538

Oh, boy!

02:35.889 --> 02:38.653
Who are you?
Who are you?

02:38.725 --> 02:42.092
<i>Alia.
Where did you come from?</i>

02:42.162 --> 02:44.221
The future.
Where?

02:44.297 --> 02:46.288
I mean, when?

02:47.433 --> 02:51.369
Not now.
Are-Are you talking to a hologram?

02:58.111 --> 03:02.377
Why haven't I leaped? Why am I still here?

03:02.448 --> 03:05.417
Lothos has decided you've got
one more thing to do before you go.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.851
Surprise!

03:07.921 --> 03:10.082
- Why are you doing this?
- Because she's evil.

03:10.156 --> 03:14.525
<i>You have the power, Alia.
You can choose not to kill me.</i>

03:16.763 --> 03:19.698
No.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.451
Arnold, what are you doing?
Get off!

03:47.527 --> 03:49.825
<i>Are you insane?
I can't see.!</i>

03:58.204 --> 04:01.071
You're gonna get us killed!

04:01.140 --> 04:03.734
<i>Slow down.! Hey.!</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:13.916
Oh, my God.

04:13.987 --> 04:18.481
Just what the hell
kind of stunt was that?

04:20.660 --> 04:24.187
- I don't know.
- He must've landed on his head. Lucky it's empty.

04:24.264 --> 04:29.258
You guys were, uh, draggin', huh?

04:29.335 --> 04:31.963
Uh, draggin'? Duh!

04:32.038 --> 04:34.336
- We were chicken racing.
- Yeah, till you hitched a ride.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.272
- Don't you get it?
- Get what?

04:36.342 --> 04:38.435
He's the Midnight Marauder.

04:38.511 --> 04:42.106
- Right?
- Uh, yeah, right.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.945
<i>Listen, uh, I gotta-
I gotta get goin', guys.</i>

04:45.018 --> 04:47.885
No, you're not goin' anywhere, Arnold.

04:49.322 --> 04:52.553
How'd you know who I was?
Everyone knows who you are.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.822
You're the weenie who just screwed up
a Chi Kappa initiation.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.295
I think he thought I was in danger.
You were.

04:58.364 --> 05:03.199
Look, we have been hazing pledges since before
you were born, spaz, and we haven't lost one yet.

05:03.269 --> 05:07.831
Well, there's always a first time. Yeah,
well, Arnold, here's a first for you.

05:18.284 --> 05:21.811
Enough of that, all of ya.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.413
Let's break it up.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.424
Shame on all of ya, huh?

05:26.492 --> 05:30.360
Now, who's gonna tell me
what's been goin' on?

05:30.430 --> 05:33.490
Who might you be?
A refugee from Joe McCarthy?

05:36.135 --> 05:39.332
They were having
a fraternity initiation thing.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.737
Um, it's called a "hazing. "

05:44.344 --> 05:46.403
<i>They were havin' a chicken-
Picnic.</i>

05:46.479 --> 05:49.448
A fried chicken box social,
right, everyone?

05:51.584 --> 05:55.418
Well, you can thank God that I didn't
see you racin' those crates, huh?

05:55.488 --> 05:58.423
Or you'd all be bunkin'
in the jail tonight.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.459
<i>But, as it is,</i>

06:00.526 --> 06:03.427
I've gotta get your names
for your dean of discipline.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.488
Let's start with you, Superman.
Arnold.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.194
Arnold what?

06:09.268 --> 06:12.066
Arnold the- the Midnight Marauder.

06:12.138 --> 06:15.699
<i>- Everybody knows me, I guess.
- It's Arnold Watkins.</i>

06:15.775 --> 06:19.768
W- A-T-K-I-N-S.

06:23.983 --> 06:26.816
<i>College is wasted on the young.
I mean, think of it.</i>

06:26.886 --> 06:30.652
<i>A four-year license to learn and have fun
without the pressures of work and family.</i>

06:30.723 --> 06:35.558
<i>But whoever this guy Arnold was,
he was lucky his license hadn't been revoked.</i>

06:35.628 --> 06:37.596
It's you.
Al.

06:37.663 --> 06:41.121
- Of course it's me.
- No, I'm talkin' about the cape. It's you.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.725
Al, where have you been?

06:43.803 --> 06:45.668
What took you so long to get here?

06:45.738 --> 06:49.435
Well, I would've been here sooner, but I had to
calm down your counterpart in the waiting room.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.443
<i>This guy's really something.
I bet.</i>

06:51.511 --> 06:55.311
<i>The Midnight Marauder, defender of
the faith, protector of the innocent.</i>

06:55.381 --> 06:57.781
- He's a wacko.
- Look, Al, that's all great.

06:57.850 --> 07:01.251
But would you get outta here
so I can get some sleep?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.254
<i>I don't think you're gonna have time.</i>

07:03.322 --> 07:05.256
<i>What?
In the original history,</i>

07:05.324 --> 07:08.418
both Arnold and Jerry died when
Arnold tried to stop the chicken race.

07:08.494 --> 07:11.258
But you saved 'em both,
so hold onto your hat...

07:11.330 --> 07:15.892
<i>or your cape or that thing,
whatever it is. Al, if that's-</i>

07:15.968 --> 07:21.031
if that's the whole problem, then why
didn't I leap as soon as the race ended?

07:21.107 --> 07:24.440
- That's a good question.
- Or why didn't I leap as soon as the cop got everything under control?

07:24.510 --> 07:26.637
You're full of good questions today.
Al, please.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.806
Huh? I'm beat,
okay? My hair hurts.

07:29.882 --> 07:33.511
So either have Ziggy figure out what I'm doin'
here, or get outta here so I can get some sleep.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.451
<i>I'm goin', okay?</i>

07:37.523 --> 07:40.924
So this is your roommate,
Jack Swenson.

07:40.993 --> 07:46.761
He's pledging this fraternity
that you just annoyed.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.063
So where you been?

07:49.135 --> 07:51.160
Oh, I, uh-Al.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.865
I was at the library.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.340
Library closed an hour ago.
Yeah.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.969
I finished studying, and then I went, uh
- Jogging.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.172
Jogging.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.238
What's that?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.978
Jogging.
You know.

08:06.052 --> 08:09.510
Running.
Anyway, I, uh-

08:09.589 --> 08:13.582
It was dark, and there was a hole, and I kind
of tripped and fell a little bit. He's clumsy.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.924
Right, right.
And, uh, what would this be, huh?

08:16.996 --> 08:19.328
<i>That's his blankie.
You know, Arnold,</i>

08:19.398 --> 08:21.332
Chi Kappa Delta
was out at Road's End tonight.

08:21.400 --> 08:26.861
They were initiating a couple of new pledges, and, uh,
word has it that, uh, you broke it up, Mr. Midnight.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.673
All right. Okay.
I was there.

08:32.745 --> 08:35.679
No kidding? You know,
Mike Hammond called me on the phone...

08:35.748 --> 08:37.841
about 10 minutes ago,
and you know what he said?

08:37.917 --> 08:42.149
He said that they weren't sure that they wanted to
pledge anyone with such a monumental jerk as a roommate.

08:42.221 --> 08:45.452
Why would you wanna pledge a fraternity
that's full of idiots in the first place?

08:45.525 --> 08:48.187
<i>- Full of what?
- You said the wrong thing, Sam.</i>

08:48.261 --> 08:51.196
His dad was a Chi Kappa Delta idiot,
and his granddad,

08:51.264 --> 08:53.357
and his great-granddad
was a founding idiot.

08:53.432 --> 08:56.265
Arnold, look.
At first, it was funny, all right?

08:56.335 --> 09:00.101
I mean, it was, you prancing around in your
little cape and hat and playing Errol Flynn.

09:00.172 --> 09:03.869
You were a joke.
We all laughed.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.877
But it's not funny anymore.

09:05.945 --> 09:10.348
And if you don't stop pulling these loony
stunts, you're gonna get yourself hurt.

09:10.416 --> 09:13.647
Or worse.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.620
<i>Well, I guess you told him
a thing or two, huh?</i>

09:16.689 --> 09:19.385
<i>I blew it, Al.</i>

09:19.458 --> 09:21.392
No, no, actually, you didn't.
I didn't?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.519
No. Jack has been
bullying Arnold all semester,

09:23.596 --> 09:26.190
copying his assignments,
makin' him do his laundry.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.233
And Jack's mother
won't doJack's laundry.

09:28.301 --> 09:32.795
What are you tellin' me? I'm here to
teach Jackie how to fluff and fold?

09:32.872 --> 09:34.806
Well, we don't know yet.

09:34.874 --> 09:39.243
But, uh, don't lift your leg
on the family tree again, please.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.746
Thank you.
You're welcome.

09:41.814 --> 09:45.807
What am I worried about anyway?
I mean, after all, I am the-

09:47.587 --> 09:49.521
That's the Midnight Marauder?

09:49.589 --> 09:53.389
<i>You're a scholarship student,
and you're taking a double load of credits.</i>

09:53.459 --> 09:55.450
Oh, you must be smart.
Favorite course?

09:55.528 --> 09:58.326
Eh-
Astronomy.

09:58.397 --> 10:02.697
How'd you know that? Because the Midnight
Marauder knows all, sees all, tells nothing.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.293
Oh, no.
Oftentimes, he-What?

10:05.371 --> 10:08.169
Well, your mind is merging
with the Midnight Avenger.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.174
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.267
It is not. I'm fine.
And it's Marauder.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.279
See?
See what?

10:14.347 --> 10:18.010
<i>Sam, this is a guy that loves to dress
up in tights and run around in the dark...</i>

10:18.084 --> 10:20.416
<i>pullin'crazy stunts
like Captain Goody Two-shoes.</i>

10:20.486 --> 10:23.353
Yeah, well, after today's stunt,
he's lucky to still be alive.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.619
Yeah, he's amazing.
He's like a walkin' miracle.

10:26.692 --> 10:31.857
Why, only last week in the rain, this guy
decided to run in front of a speeding car-

10:31.931 --> 10:34.491
And save a fetching coed
from certain death.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.159
Quit it!
Undaunted, he-

10:36.235 --> 10:38.669
Sam, quit that!

10:38.738 --> 10:41.104
The driver swore that he hit him.
But then when he ran back,

10:41.173 --> 10:44.336
there's Arnold comforting the girl
and yelling at him for driving too fast.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.776
He didn't have a scratch on him.

10:46.846 --> 10:49.110
Well, let's just hope that his luck holds,
Al, 'cause right now,

10:49.181 --> 10:52.207
I've got a whole fraternity
of hot-rodders gunnin' for him.

11:00.192 --> 11:03.218
<i>Hey, Arnold?
Arnold Watkins.</i>

11:03.295 --> 11:07.197
L- I just wanted to thank you again.
Forget it.

11:07.266 --> 11:10.429
No, I can't.
I did a lot of thinking last night,

11:10.503 --> 11:13.233
and I don't even know why
I wanted to pledge Chi Kappa.

11:13.305 --> 11:16.001
I withdrew my application.
Smart move.

11:16.075 --> 11:18.202
I also made sure
you got the credit you deserved.

11:18.277 --> 11:22.714
Look, Jerry, Arn-
I don't want credit.

11:22.782 --> 11:26.218
That's why I wear the mask.
I did what anybody else would do.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.617
Jumping on the hood of a car
at the start of a race?

11:28.688 --> 11:32.954
You did what nobody had the guts to do,
and I'm alive to prove it.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.425
I'm really grateful.

11:35.494 --> 11:39.590
<i>- Hey, Froot Loop, where are your tights?
- Yeah.</i>

11:39.665 --> 11:42.361
- Excuse us. We're late for class.
- Aw!

11:42.435 --> 11:44.426
<i>Read it and weep, spaz.</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:49.436
"Midnight Marauder saves life of undergrad. "

11:49.508 --> 11:52.443
<i>Of course, I don't get a byline
since I'm only first-year.</i>

11:52.511 --> 11:55.378
Our whole fraternity's on probation
because of you, Arnold. I'm not happy.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.212
- Well, you earned it.
- Yeah? Well, you earned something else too, pal.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.377
<i>Hey, save it. Mike, save it.!
Let go of me.!</i>

12:00.453 --> 12:03.081
Cool it. We can't. Dean Sakmar
finds out you popped this toad,

12:03.155 --> 12:06.215
and Chi Kappa Delta'll
be off campus.

12:06.292 --> 12:09.193
<i>I never met a real superhero before.</i>

12:09.261 --> 12:11.559
Hi. I'm Dawn Taylor.

12:11.630 --> 12:15.066
Hi, I'm Arnold Watkins.

12:15.134 --> 12:18.763
Just how fast
was that speeding car going?

12:18.838 --> 12:21.773
Oh, it wasn't really going fast.
I mean, when I got on it-

12:24.477 --> 12:26.570
You okay?

12:26.645 --> 12:30.741
She's fine. She's fine. Her only problem
is, she's smelling your dirty socks, Arnold.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.977
Right, baby?
Yeah, right.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.486
What were you saying, Arnold?

12:35.554 --> 12:37.920
Never mind.
It was nothing.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.494
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it was nice meeting you too.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.998
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.006
He's so modest, it's cute.
Cute?

12:55.074 --> 12:58.373
He's a twerp. Look at his clothes.
Hey, you got wheels, Arnold?

12:58.444 --> 13:01.538
Yeah. Yeah, sure he does.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.481
- Studebaker, right?
- Studebaker.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.986
<i>Look, I hate to break things up, but,
uh, we gotta get to class. Come on.</i>

13:08.053 --> 13:10.886
You get back to class, Arnold, but
put this in your twisted little head.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.289
<i>I am holding you personally responsible
for getting us in trouble with the dean.</i>

13:14.360 --> 13:20.230
Yeah, well, twist on this, pal. You wanna know
who's responsible, take a look in the mirror.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.564
I'm gonna kill him.
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill that guy!

13:25.638 --> 13:27.629
Cool it, Mike.
Anything happens to little Arnold,

13:27.706 --> 13:30.402
and we'll get our butts kicked outta here
faster than you can say "expelled. "

13:30.476 --> 13:34.071
We're just supposed to let
this happen? The dean, remember?

13:39.885 --> 13:44.345
Guess why we're here, darling. Lothos says
we're dealing with some Woody Allen type.

13:44.423 --> 13:47.392
Perfect job for a homecoming queen.

13:47.459 --> 13:51.555
- There's nothing else we can do.
- Frat boys. My favorite college subject.

13:51.630 --> 13:55.498
<i>Yes, there is. What? What do
you wanna do, hire a hit man?</i>

13:55.568 --> 13:59.664
How do you think the Midnight Marauder would feel if he
suddenly became very close friends with the homecoming queen?

13:59.738 --> 14:03.401
- Go on.
- And then the homecoming queen tells the nerd it's all a big joke.

14:03.475 --> 14:07.070
- Where?
- Someplace public, like a homecoming rally,

14:07.146 --> 14:09.614
so the whole college can see.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.877
And if he doesn't jump out of a window,
he'll at least drop out.

14:11.951 --> 14:16.581
- I opt for the window.
- This is a new you. I love the way you think.

14:28.033 --> 14:32.993
<i>Al hadn't gotten back to me, but
it was pretty clear why I hadn't leaped yet.</i>

14:33.072 --> 14:36.132
<i>I had a suspicion that a slap on the wrist
from the dean wasn't gonna be enough...</i>

14:36.208 --> 14:40.474
<i>to keep Mike Hammond
and his frat brothers from their games.</i>

14:40.546 --> 14:43.538
<i>I knew there had to be a way
to get through to them,</i>

14:43.616 --> 14:46.585
<i>and I think maybe I just found it.</i>

14:46.652 --> 14:48.779
Uh, this seat's not taken.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.481
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:56.262 --> 14:58.253
Thanks.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.668
I'm sorry Mike was such a jerk today.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.103
<i>Oh, it's not your fault.
Most of the time he's really sweet.</i>

15:07.172 --> 15:09.436
He only acts macho
when it comes to his fraternity.

15:09.508 --> 15:13.274
- "Macho"?
- Yeah, I learned it last summer in Spain.

15:13.345 --> 15:16.781
<i>It means "manly, masculine. "
Macho.</i>

15:16.849 --> 15:21.343
Yeah, well, he sure likes actin' macho when he's
out chicken racing with his buddies, doesn't he?

15:21.420 --> 15:23.752
- Yeah, you're not kidding.
- Have you ever tried to talk him out of it?

15:23.822 --> 15:26.290
He doesn't listen to me.
I'm just his girl.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.259
Oh, yeah, right.
It's the '50s.

15:29.328 --> 15:34.391
I mean, I've got this feeling
that-that someday,

15:34.466 --> 15:38.027
<i>men are gonna be much more
receptive to the way women think.</i>

15:38.103 --> 15:40.128
Their ideas.
You know, someday.

15:40.205 --> 15:44.608
That's nice.
I'm glad somebody thinks that.

15:44.677 --> 15:48.841
<i>Mike is so mean to you.
Why do you care about him?</i>

15:48.914 --> 15:50.814
The Midnight Marauder
cares about everybody.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.943
You mean Arnold Watkins
really cares about people?

15:54.019 --> 15:57.182
Right.
Everybody needs to be cared for.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.482
- You remind me of someone.
- Clark Kent?

16:01.560 --> 16:05.155
Don't sell yourself short.

16:05.230 --> 16:09.394
<i>I can't place who, but I think it's wonderful
that you help people.</i>

16:11.337 --> 16:14.636
- Thanks.
- I wish somebody would rescue me from my biology midterm.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.870
<i>But it's not exactly a job
for the Midnight Marauder.</i>

16:17.943 --> 16:21.401
Oh, now, don't say that.
I'm, uh- I'm pretty good at science.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.811
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:24.550 --> 16:28.384
I tell you what.
I have a little pull with Mike.

16:28.454 --> 16:33.892
<i>If you help me with my biology midterm,</i>

16:33.959 --> 16:36.018
I'll talk to him
and see if I can't convince...

16:36.095 --> 16:40.156
him and the Chi Kappas
to find some safer form of initiation.

16:40.232 --> 16:43.360
- You got yourself a deal.
- 7:00, my dorm, tonight?

16:43.435 --> 16:46.836
- It's a date.
- Okay.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.930
Okay.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.411
<i>Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Shh.!</i>

16:53.479 --> 16:55.470
It's okay.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.809
I'll see you tonight at 7:00.

17:03.989 --> 17:08.688
- I'm talking about Michael of the Chi Kappas.
- Don't worry about him. He's taken care of.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.127
I believe you.
You have the light of truth in your eyes.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.723
My ex-wives would never say that.

17:15.800 --> 17:20.204
It makes me furious. Hammond is only one of a million
villains who victimize the weak and the innocent.

17:20.271 --> 17:23.673
Here we go- the Midnight Marauder.

17:23.742 --> 17:28.406
So you understand my mission?
Arnold, you're a college student.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.938
Your mission is to get good grades,
swallow a couple of goldfish,

17:32.017 --> 17:34.747
and figure out how much you can drink
without blowing chunks.

17:34.820 --> 17:38.654
What?
Without barfing.

17:39.758 --> 17:45.196
That may be true for the others,
but not for the Midnight Marauder.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.630
What makes you so special?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.007
Well, don't you look special.

18:04.783 --> 18:07.980
Arnold, that's a clip-on.
Well, it's the only one I had.

18:08.053 --> 18:10.613
Well, I'll let you borrow one of mine.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.782
Uh, here.
Thanks.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.792
This'll do. Yeah.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.589
So, where you goin'?
Uh, study.

18:19.665 --> 18:23.362
You're gonna wear a tie to go study?
Well, I have a date.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.426
Oh, a date.

18:25.504 --> 18:30.703
A study date. Oh, all right. So, who's the, uh
- who's the lucky girl?

18:30.776 --> 18:33.540
Oh, it-it is a girl, right?

18:33.612 --> 18:36.581
Yeah, it's a girl, all right.
Let me guess. Let me guess.

18:36.648 --> 18:39.776
It was that six-foot-tall beanpole
with the, uh, Brillo-pad hair, right?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.252
You could guess all night,
you'd never come up with this one.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.312
Oh. Thanks.
Yeah.

18:44.389 --> 18:46.653
Well, I gotta go.
Where are you goin'?

18:48.360 --> 18:52.626
Tonight's your initiation, isn't it? Bingo. That's what I like about you, Arnold
- always on top of things.

18:52.698 --> 18:56.065
Chi Kappa Delta. Are you gonna race? I
don't know. They never tell the pledges.

18:56.135 --> 19:00.970
But, uh, yeah.
So, how do I look, huh?

19:01.039 --> 19:02.973
Like a dead man.

19:03.041 --> 19:06.033
Jack, don't do this.
You say that like I have a choice.

19:06.111 --> 19:08.170
You do have a choice.
Yeah, right.

19:08.247 --> 19:12.308
I can tell my dad and my granddad that I couldn't join
Chi Kappa because I wimped out of the initiation process.

19:12.384 --> 19:15.512
No, I-I think I'd rather
go chicken racing.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.612
I'll see ya, Arnold.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.023
Uh, hey, you look-

19:24.096 --> 19:27.293
Don't start, all right? Please, don't
start. Sort of, but not very much.

19:27.366 --> 19:32.929
Listen, I want you to get to Ziggy, okay, and find out what
she thinks the odds are that I'm here to stop the chicken races.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.530
Uh, 62.4.
Oh, Al.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.700
It's gotta be better than that.
Well, don't be so sure.

19:37.776 --> 19:39.676
Why not?
It's Arnold, Sam.

19:39.745 --> 19:43.044
What happened to Arnold?
He's had an incredible string of luck.

19:43.115 --> 19:47.552
But according to Ziggy, it's inevitable
that he's gonna get killed or get maimed...

19:47.619 --> 19:50.110
if he keeps up with
this Midnight Marauder junk.

19:50.189 --> 19:54.353
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's not here
with me. He's with you. Well, here's what you do.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.724
You keep wearing that silly tie-
Al-

19:56.795 --> 19:58.729
but you sit on the stupid red cape.

19:58.797 --> 20:01.265
I can't.
What do you mean, you can't?

20:01.333 --> 20:03.267
Of course you can. Yes, you
can. All right, all right.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.269
Let's just assume that
you're right, okay? Okay.

20:05.337 --> 20:09.034
Then you and Beeks have to do a profile on Arnold
right away, okay, to find out what makes him tick.

20:09.107 --> 20:12.634
Otherwise, I'm gonna leap outta here, he'll leap
back in, and he'll start marauding all over again.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.202
Okay. I agree with you.
You agree?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.714
Yeah, I agree.
Oh. Oh, well, good.

20:17.783 --> 20:20.047
Of course it's good.

20:20.118 --> 20:23.087
Now what are you doing?
I've got work to do.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.090
What are you doing with that
stupid hat on? My mission.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.887
Your mission, "schmission. "
Remember?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.951
What about the odds?

20:30.028 --> 20:32.895
The Midnight Marauder
scoffs at the odds.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.769
<i>Sam, don't you wanna use the door?</i>

20:39.705 --> 20:41.730
Ha!

20:41.807 --> 20:43.741
<i>Where the hell is he?</i>

20:43.809 --> 20:47.404
He'll be here.
Nerds are nothing if not punctual.

20:47.479 --> 20:50.209
Would you relax?
I guarantee within five minutes,

20:50.282 --> 20:53.149
I'll have Arnold's slide rule
fully extended.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.448
That's my girl.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.455
<i>Oh, darling, you won't believe this.</i>

20:58.523 --> 21:02.755
Your dream date is back at Road's End
messing things up again.

21:07.499 --> 21:12.664
<i>We're lucky tonight, brothers. Our pledge
is a third-generation Chi Kappa Delta.</i>

21:14.740 --> 21:19.177
<i>He will be racing against brother Frank Pabst.</i>

21:19.244 --> 21:21.212
Now, Frank's our champion,
so you don't have to beat him.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.373
<i>You just have to-
You don't even have to race him.</i>

21:26.618 --> 21:28.609
- Oh, I hate this.
- Arnold!

21:28.687 --> 21:31.952
<i>Risking one's life for a foolish reason
is a crime against Mother Nature.</i>

21:32.024 --> 21:34.515
<i>Sam, you're completely out of control.!</i>

21:34.593 --> 21:37.323
- Him, foolish?
- Boy, is he right!

21:37.396 --> 21:39.830
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you're insane, Watkins,

21:39.898 --> 21:42.867
for even dreaming about
coming out here and challenging us.

21:42.934 --> 21:45.164
I'm saying that you don't have to
be here! Jack lives through this!

21:45.237 --> 21:47.967
- Oh, boy.
- I smell blood here.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.167
<i>Are you tellin'me
thatJack is not in danger?</i>

21:50.242 --> 21:53.006
- No, the only one in danger here is you, bozo.
- Why didn't you warn me?

21:53.078 --> 21:56.206
I did! You were too busy dressing
up as Little Red Riding Hood!

21:56.281 --> 21:58.806
You gotta figure me a way
outta this fast, Al.

21:58.884 --> 22:01.682
Did I hear that right?
Lothos?

22:01.753 --> 22:04.221
Oh, it's him.
It can't be!

22:04.289 --> 22:07.258
What are we gonna do?
"We"? I'm not even here!

22:07.326 --> 22:10.887
<i>Al.! If I were you,
I'd head for the bushes,</i>

22:10.962 --> 22:12.395
wherever the bushes are.

22:12.464 --> 22:17.527
- Get him!
- Go for the bushes, Sam! Go, if you can find any. It's so dark.

22:17.602 --> 22:23.268
Your little Arnold the dweezil
is none other than Dr. Samuel Beckett.

22:28.814 --> 22:31.544
<i>There's no worse feeling
than being the object of a hunt,</i>

22:31.616 --> 22:35.882
<i>especially when the people chasing you are
a bunch ofjocks with oatmeal for brains.</i>

22:35.954 --> 22:41.017
<i>But whatever Arnold and the Midnight
Marauder had started, I couldn't seem to stop.</i>

22:41.093 --> 22:45.393
- Is the coast clear?
- Sam, would you come out from there, please?

22:46.665 --> 22:49.259
Where are they?
I don't know.

22:49.334 --> 22:53.168
They probably figured that you were on the way
back to the dorm. You're safe for the moment.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.468
Yeah, except
I can't go to my own room.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.735
Well, I told you to stay there,
but, no-

22:57.809 --> 23:00.676
No, what you told me
didn't make any sense.

23:00.746 --> 23:04.842
Besides, I-I had to do something.
No, you didn't.

23:04.916 --> 23:09.012
Arnold says that you got a bio midterm in the
morning. You could have been studying, that's what.

23:09.087 --> 23:11.555
What time is it?
12:04.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.148
Oh! I had a study date.
I missed it.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.160
Oh, Dawn.
No, she'll still be there.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.992
She'll probably be happy to put up
a homeless marauder for a night.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.794
You lucky dog.
Al. Al.

23:21.867 --> 23:25.394
Al, the women's dorm
is closed to men at all times.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.938
How did I know that?
I told you.

23:28.006 --> 23:33.638
Huh? Mind-merging. You've absorbed
a little bit of Arnold's mind.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.839
Speaking of Arnold,
how's he doin' anyway?

23:35.914 --> 23:40.578
Well, we've been talking. But seeing how you're
both acting, I better put Dr. Beeks on overtime.

23:50.162 --> 23:54.565
You know, Lothos is not too pleased with
your prior performance concerning Dr. Beckett.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.999
Well, then why the hell
did he send me here?

23:57.068 --> 24:00.367
- Seems to be as much of a surprise to Lothos as it is to us.
- He's supposed to know everything.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.933
He does. Dr. Beckett's appearances
follow the random event theory.

24:05.010 --> 24:07.808
It's just a fantastic stroke of luck.

24:07.879 --> 24:12.373
- Or maybe a little test to see if you've improved.
- Just tell me my mission.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.648
Oh, don't tell me.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.655
- After all you've been through, you still-
- Just tell me.

24:18.723 --> 24:21.954
I'm supposed to kill him, right?
I'm supposed to blow his brains out?

24:22.027 --> 24:25.656
Afraid not, darling. Seems you weren't
too successful with the gun last time.

24:25.730 --> 24:28.028
Perhaps a grenade or a flamethrower.

24:28.099 --> 24:31.899
- Zoey, just tell me!
- Lothos hasn't decided.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.632
<i>But whatever happens,
Beckett must not know that you're here.</i>

24:34.706 --> 24:39.040
So you may not touch him.
Pity.

24:42.247 --> 24:45.705
I need to talk to you again, kid.
Am I free to return now?

24:45.784 --> 24:50.881
No, not yet. Uh, I've had Dr. Beeks
do a little computer research on you.

24:50.956 --> 24:55.655
Is that Dr. Beeks? No. Dr. Beeks is a
person. She's a psychologist. She works here.

24:55.727 --> 24:58.025
So that's a computer?
A terminal, yeah.

24:58.096 --> 25:00.530
It's amazing. The computer at the
college takes up rooms and rooms.

25:00.599 --> 25:06.060
We've checked into your past, Arnold.

25:06.137 --> 25:08.071
The Midnight Marauder
has no past.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.664
Well, Dr. Beeks disagrees.

25:10.742 --> 25:14.974
She says that we should talk
about your parents.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.676
They died when I was seven.
I know.

25:18.750 --> 25:22.083
I also know how they died.
I was too young to remember.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.246
I think you remember.
No, I don't.

25:24.322 --> 25:26.415
Oh.

25:26.491 --> 25:31.053
Well, maybe you're trying hard
not to remember.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.427
But...

25:33.498 --> 25:38.959
everything that you've done
ever since is because of this.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.870
Uh, the Masked Marauder stuff-

25:41.940 --> 25:43.874
Someone has to defend the innocent.

25:43.942 --> 25:46.877
Your parents were innocent,
weren't they, Arnold?

25:46.945 --> 25:50.472
Do you remember a place called
Latrobe, Pennsylvania,

25:50.549 --> 25:53.541
1944?

25:53.618 --> 25:58.317
And a little diner named
Rinker's Diner on Main Street?

26:01.293 --> 26:05.423
And a man named...
Leon Kanowski?

26:19.477 --> 26:21.945
- Hey, baby. Right here.
- Let go of me.

26:22.013 --> 26:25.176
What's wrong with you?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.844
- Nothing.
- Where'd you disappear to last night? I tried to call you.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.683
I had a study date.
Or did you forget?

26:30.755 --> 26:34.919
No, I didn't forget. But that was before
your date tried to break up our initiation.

26:34.993 --> 26:40.329
I know. I was there. It was hilarious watching you
all plowing through the bushes looking for him...

26:40.398 --> 26:42.491
with Arnold safely
curled up in my backseat.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.799
Get your hands off me. This
is me, baby. Mike. Your guy.

26:50.875 --> 26:54.811
My ex-guy.

26:54.879 --> 26:57.109
Don't tell me you're hot for that wimp.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.446
Oh, you'd be amazed, Mike.

26:59.517 --> 27:04.819
A man's performance on the basketball court
has nothing to do with his performance in bed.

27:18.303 --> 27:22.296
Congratulations, stud.
What did I do now?

27:22.374 --> 27:24.808
<i>- I don't know, Arnold. Just what did you do?
- Nothing.</i>

27:24.876 --> 27:26.901
- Right.
- Don't be so modest, Arnie.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.843
"Arnie"?
"Arnie"?

27:28.913 --> 27:31.313
- I'm not ashamed of what we did.
- Oh, that does it.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.851
I want you, dweebo, today at
the quarry. Just wait a minute-

27:33.918 --> 27:36.910
And bring your wheels! If you wanna
commit suicide, that's your problem.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.979
That's not what you said last night.
What?

27:39.057 --> 27:41.548
You said Mike and his friends were just
playing a bunch of crazy kids' games-

27:41.626 --> 27:44.857
that they had no idea
what real danger was like.

27:44.929 --> 27:47.363
<i>I'll show you danger.
The quarry, an hour.</i>

27:50.101 --> 27:52.467
Dawn, what's going on?

27:57.142 --> 27:59.508
Oh, my God.

27:59.577 --> 28:02.375
Alia?
I don't have a choice, Sam.

28:04.149 --> 28:08.051
Alia?
You don't understand.

28:08.119 --> 28:11.020
They tortured me.
Let me go, Sam.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.353
It really is you.
Let me go.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.917
I saw you die.
It was worse than death.

28:18.630 --> 28:22.122
Please, Sam, let me go.
Not until you tell me why you're here.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.296
I can't. Please don't make me
go through that kind of pain again.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.601
Please.

28:28.673 --> 28:31.767
It's Arnold, isn't it?

28:31.843 --> 28:34.209
Isn't it?

28:37.182 --> 28:40.447
You saved him, didn't you?

28:40.518 --> 28:43.817
And now you're here to change that.
He has to die.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.325
Where's what's-her-face?
Uh, Chloe or- Zoey.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.260
She here? No, but she
could be here any second.

28:51.329 --> 28:55.732
And if she sees me talking to you, she could tell Lothos, and then
- I'm not gonna let you go away again.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.769
You don't have a choice. Yes,
I do. Yes, I do, and so do you.

28:58.837 --> 29:01.772
You said that last time, and look
where I am now. Alia, listen to me.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.274
Maybe we can leap out of here together.

29:04.342 --> 29:06.776
What?
Maybe if we're close,

29:06.845 --> 29:09.507
if we're holding onto each other
when I leap,

29:09.581 --> 29:12.846
then just maybe
because we're the same,

29:12.917 --> 29:16.353
maybe we can leap together,
and you can leave Lothos behind forever.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.355
No.
Yes. Why not?

29:18.423 --> 29:21.756
No, they'll know. Zoey will know.
Lothos will know. We'll just be careful.

29:21.826 --> 29:26.092
Look, I can't give you all the details, but Al is working
with Arnold right now. And when he's done, I should leap.

29:26.164 --> 29:27.426
Should?
Yes.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.024
What was your plan? I mean, how were you gonna kill me
- Arnold?

29:30.101 --> 29:33.264
I don't even know.
Zoey doesn't trust me.

29:33.338 --> 29:38.366
All I know is that I'm supposed to get you to
drag race Mike at the cliffs. All right. Okay.

29:38.443 --> 29:42.038
Then we'll just play along.
I mean, if I have to drag race, I'll drag race.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.604
Or I'll talk him out of it, whatever,
until Al shows up.

29:44.682 --> 29:48.140
Well, how long will that be?
I don't know.

29:48.219 --> 29:51.017
But soon.

29:51.089 --> 29:54.525
Alia, you have to trust me.

29:54.592 --> 29:59.495
It'll work. I'll leap,
and you'll go with me.

30:04.202 --> 30:06.329
Sam?
Yeah?

30:09.874 --> 30:11.808
What if I leap first?

30:24.622 --> 30:26.613
Delicious.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.599
<i>Sam, how's it goin'?</i>

30:38.670 --> 30:42.367
Sam, you're not dressin' up like
that Midnight Avenger again, are you?

30:42.440 --> 30:45.068
Marauder, Al. And, no, I'm not.
See? I'm not wearin' a cape.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.941
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

30:50.148 --> 30:52.582
So what are you gonna be,
a Hell's Angel or somethin'?

30:52.650 --> 30:54.641
Look, what's goin' on, Al?
Well, I'm not sure.

30:54.719 --> 30:58.587
I just had a session with Arnold, and I
think I'm startin' to get through to that kid.

30:58.656 --> 31:02.387
But I tell you what,
he's had it very tough.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.893
- Sam?
- Hmm?

31:05.964 --> 31:08.592
Why are you dressing up
like Marlon Brando?

31:08.666 --> 31:11.362
- Aren't you supposed to be back in the waiting room?
- A little touchy, aren't you?

31:11.436 --> 31:14.462
<i>No, I'm not touchy.
I'm just-</i>

31:14.539 --> 31:18.532
I'm just a little nervous, that's all. You know, I
mean, I gotta go out and do those chicken races today.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.202
Sam.
What?

31:20.278 --> 31:22.075
Are you hiding something?
No, I'm not.

31:22.146 --> 31:24.580
Sam.
I'm not hiding anything.

31:24.649 --> 31:27.584
I know you too well.
Now, what's goin' on?

31:27.652 --> 31:30.985
You trust me, don't you?
Almost.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.819
Look, Al, all I'm doin' is
I'm just bidin' my time, okay,

31:33.892 --> 31:36.156
until you and Beeks
get Arnold squared away.

31:36.227 --> 31:41.529
That's it. So, you know, as soon as you do that,
then I'll be able to leap out of here, right?

31:41.599 --> 31:45.501
Uh, 79.5% chance you'll leap, yeah.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.403
- Get back there and get workin' on
Arnold so I can leap outta here. - Sam-

31:48.473 --> 31:50.441
- I gotta go, Al.
- Sam- - I gotta go.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.601
<i>Sam-</i>

32:00.718 --> 32:04.017
You think he'll show? I'm a
student of human nature, Frank.

32:04.088 --> 32:08.218
He'll definitely show.
Aren't you worried about the dean?

32:08.293 --> 32:12.627
Do I look worried?
No.

32:18.069 --> 32:21.266
<i>- Where's your Studebaker?
- This car's just fine.</i>

32:21.339 --> 32:24.137
- Tell me that you've ever been in a race, Arnold.
- More than one.

32:26.577 --> 32:29.603
And what about you? You're just
here to make sure everything's fair?

32:29.681 --> 32:31.911
In love and war, right?

32:39.724 --> 32:41.658
<i>The guy's a bum.</i>

32:41.726 --> 32:44.524
Sam, this is insane.
You'll die, I'll leap, and-

32:44.595 --> 32:46.756
It'll work.
It'll never work.

32:46.831 --> 32:48.992
<i>Zoey?</i>

32:49.067 --> 32:52.730
<i>Uh-huh. She's here.
I've been watching you all day.</i>

32:52.804 --> 32:55.705
<i>You have?
Mm-hmm.</i>

32:55.773 --> 32:59.004
You get a B-plus
for Mr. Fraternity over there.

32:59.077 --> 33:01.545
Only a B-plus?
Well, let's see.

33:01.612 --> 33:04.012
What do we do? I'll take
care of it. Don't sweat it.

33:04.082 --> 33:07.711
He gets caught cheating on a final,
he gets expelled from college,

33:07.785 --> 33:10.151
and even his own daddy
won't employ him.

33:10.221 --> 33:12.587
Oh, isn't that special.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.921
<i>Makes you wonder
what really happened.</i>

33:14.993 --> 33:19.555
But now, for the real target-
Dr. Beckett.

33:19.630 --> 33:23.122
<i>His name was Leon Kanowski.
That's the right name, isn't it, Arnold?</i>

33:23.201 --> 33:25.362
I don't recognize it.

33:25.436 --> 33:28.633
He was a cop.
He had nine kids.

33:28.706 --> 33:31.197
And he got fired from his job,
and he couldn't handle the strain.

33:31.275 --> 33:34.472
Why are you asking me all
these questions? I'm sorry, kid.

33:34.545 --> 33:37.673
You said I'd be returned to my own
time. You said I wouldn't be harmed.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.775
I'm not gonna harm you. Then why
are you asking about my parents?

33:40.852 --> 33:43.343
Because I want you to be safe
when you go back.

33:43.421 --> 33:48.222
You gotta stop taking these crazy chances, tryin'
to get yourself killed. I protect the innocent.

33:48.292 --> 33:51.750
Arnold, you couldn't protect your parents...

33:51.829 --> 33:55.196
<i>when Kanowski opened fire.</i>

33:55.266 --> 33:58.429
You were seven years old.

33:58.503 --> 34:01.870
You were goin' out to the car to get your jacket
when you heard the shots.

34:03.441 --> 34:08.902
<i>By the time you came back in, it was just in time
to see Kanowski use the last bullet on himself.</i>

34:11.181 --> 34:13.742
- I should've died too.
- Oh, no.

34:13.818 --> 34:16.753
I should've died too.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.524
<i>Well, you've seen it.
Now, let's get on with it.</i>

34:34.338 --> 34:39.571
I don't suppose that there are any, uh,
rules to this insane game. Fun, isn't it?

34:39.643 --> 34:43.045
Open up those Dumbo ears, Arnold,
'cause I'm only gonna explain this once.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.547
Uh, stay with me,
'cause it's pretty complicated.

34:45.616 --> 34:48.050
First, we say "go. "

34:48.119 --> 34:52.556
Then-Then we drive as fast as we can
up to this little white line.

34:52.623 --> 34:56.184
Then the first person
to hit their brakes loses.

34:56.260 --> 35:00.356
Now, was that clear enough for you,
or do you want me to break it down again?

35:00.431 --> 35:03.958
You only got about 30 yards between the line
and the edge of the cliff. Yeah, give or take.

35:04.035 --> 35:06.526
Give or take what?
Twenty.

35:08.706 --> 35:12.164
You mind tellin' me how you plan to stop a car
between this line and the edge of the cliff?

35:12.243 --> 35:15.974
Well, duh! Never thought about that
one before. Anyone a physics major here?

35:16.047 --> 35:19.813
Let's see. Speeding object, 60-foot
drop, Newton's law of gravity-

35:19.884 --> 35:21.852
I think you can
figure it out from there.

35:21.919 --> 35:23.853
Any more questions?
Yeah, just one.

35:23.921 --> 35:26.822
What's that? How did a jerk like
you get to be president of anything?

35:26.891 --> 35:30.327
<i>Let's drag, geek!</i>

35:32.597 --> 35:34.656
I need you here, Al, right now.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.292
Your beloved admiral
isn't here, Beckett.

35:37.368 --> 35:40.394
This time,
you face your maker alone.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.929
<i>Will you get in the car, nerd-ball?
Geez.! Come on.!</i>

35:44.008 --> 35:49.674
Oh, this is so beautiful.
I'm going up for a better view.

35:52.917 --> 35:55.647
- Forgot somethin'.
- What's that? Which pedal's the brake?

35:57.889 --> 36:01.689
The stakes. If I win,
you and the Chi Kappas...

36:01.759 --> 36:05.923
have to promise that you'll stop these
stupid races as part of your initiation.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.830
Have we got a deal?

36:08.900 --> 36:10.868
I don't know.
I'll have to ask my brothers.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.995
I guess I misunderstood. I figured you
could make that kind of a decision yourself.

36:14.071 --> 36:16.164
<i>But I guess I was wrong.
No, no, wait a minute.</i>

36:17.775 --> 36:20.835
All right. You got a deal.

36:23.481 --> 36:25.415
One I'll never have to keep.

36:25.483 --> 36:28.077
<i>You're not supposed to die.</i>

36:28.152 --> 36:30.484
You weren't then,
and you're not now.

36:30.555 --> 36:34.047
You've been trying to make this death
wish come true with these dumbbell stunts.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.059
And sooner or later,
you're gonna succeed.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.061
Then who's gonna protect
the innocent?

36:38.129 --> 36:42.896
You don't have to risk your life to do
good, Arnold. And you know what's amazing?

36:42.967 --> 36:46.027
You're the most innocent one of all.

36:46.103 --> 36:48.731
You were seven years old, Arnold.
Seven!

36:48.806 --> 36:51.866
There's no way you could control
what happened to your parents.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.711
And one more thing.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.579
Do you think your folks would have
wanted it to happen this way?

36:59.650 --> 37:04.246
<i>Do you think your mom and dad would
have wished that their only son die too?</i>

37:09.627 --> 37:11.618
<i>Sam, I think I did it.</i>

37:11.696 --> 37:14.563
I think I got through to Arnold.
And you know what?

37:14.632 --> 37:19.092
He's really a very sensitive kid-
Oh, my God. It's her.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.070
<i>Say hello to Al.
He's here?</i>

37:21.138 --> 37:23.106
<i>Did he do it?
Sam, you gotta leap outta here.</i>

37:23.174 --> 37:26.268
<i>I can't control things
with her changing history. Sam?</i>

37:26.344 --> 37:28.608
I'm taking Alia with me, Al.

37:28.679 --> 37:31.443
Are you outta your mind?

37:53.904 --> 37:56.134
Go!

38:03.281 --> 38:05.340
Did you convince Arnold
to stop risking his life?

38:05.416 --> 38:09.216
Yeah, but Ziggy says the odds of Arnold getting
killed in an accident have dropped below 10%.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.814
<i>- But your odds of getting killed are over 90.!
- What's going on? What's Al saying?</i>

38:12.890 --> 38:15.381
He's saying that, uh,
everything's gonna work out just fine.

38:15.459 --> 38:18.326
- You're lying.
- Sam, stop the car, will ya?

38:18.396 --> 38:21.559
I can't, Al. If I do that, Zoey will tell
Lothos, and he'll leap her out of here.

38:21.632 --> 38:24.829
<i>- I'll lose her forever.
- Well, so lose her.! She tried to kill you.!</i>

38:24.902 --> 38:26.870
<i>She didn't. That's the whole point.
I'm taking her with me.</i>

38:26.937 --> 38:29.405
What if you don't?
What if she takes you with her?

38:35.212 --> 38:40.081
Sam, things keep changing. Somebody cut the brake
line. What are the odds of Arnold's survival, Al?

38:40.151 --> 38:42.745
Will you forget about Arnold?
Just tell me.

38:42.820 --> 38:47.587
- All right. 93%. 94. 95.
- Now what's he saying?

38:47.658 --> 38:49.592
Five more percent, and
we're outta here. Yeah.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.561
Sam, there's a cliff comin' up
in about 200 yards.

38:52.630 --> 38:54.325
<i>You owe me nothing.
You don't have any brakes.!</i>

38:54.398 --> 38:57.265
What are the odds now, Al?
Uh, 98.3 and holding.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.929
<i>- I need 100%.
- There's the finish line.</i>

39:00.004 --> 39:02.063
<i>Sam, you gotta get outta here.!
Jump.! Jump.!</i>

39:02.139 --> 39:05.336
Alia, we gotta bail. The brakes are gone.
Ready? Go!

39:15.920 --> 39:17.911
Sam, are you all right?
Alia.

39:17.988 --> 39:19.888
Oh, God. Alia.

39:19.957 --> 39:24.417
Oh, Beckett, no.
Lothos, call Alia out now!

39:24.495 --> 39:27.396
Uh, 99.4, Sam.
Point-five.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.933
Point-six.
Fight back, Sam.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.867
<i>I will kill you myself, Alia.
Point-seven.</i>

39:32.937 --> 39:34.802
Hang on.
Point-nine!

39:34.872 --> 39:36.772
Bingo! A hundred percent.

39:50.955 --> 39:54.322
Alia? Alia?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.587
<i>Sam? Sam?</i>

39:56.660 --> 39:59.629
<i>It's all right.</i>

39:59.697 --> 40:03.599
<i>It's all right. I'm right
here. Where? Where are we?</i>

40:05.035 --> 40:07.003
<i>- I don't know.
- Good Lord.</i>

40:07.071 --> 40:12.338
<i>Only a week in the box, and you
don't know where you are. Sam?</i>

40:12.410 --> 40:17.313
Sam? Sam?
Sam?

40:19.350 --> 40:21.648
If you're yellin' for a three-letter savior,

40:21.719 --> 40:24.119
I suggest you make it start with a "G."

40:31.662 --> 40:33.823
I have to get out of here.

40:33.898 --> 40:36.492
Well, that's simple.

40:36.567 --> 40:39.468
All you have to do is tell me
which one of you two did it.

40:39.537 --> 40:43.303
Did what?

40:43.374 --> 40:46.901
First, you act like you don't know where
you are. Then you pretend you don't know why.

40:46.977 --> 40:50.276
- We don't!
- Oh, you don't?

40:50.347 --> 40:53.612
Well, you better figure it out,
or you're goin' back in that box.

40:53.684 --> 40:58.314
Now, ladies, which one of you
murdered Carol Benning?

41:02.927 --> 41:05.191
Oh, boy.

41:05.262 --> 41:07.389
<i>Copy. Gate's clear.</i>

41:07.465 --> 41:09.865
<i>We had leaped together and survived,</i>

41:09.934 --> 41:14.667
<i>but we still didn't know if Alia had
leaped with me, or I had leaped with her.</i>

41:14.738 --> 41:19.038
<i>And being in a women's prison didn't make
finding the answer to that any easier.</i>

41:24.782 --> 41:26.977
Sit.

41:32.089 --> 41:34.023
Just take it easy.
We'll figure this out, okay?

41:34.091 --> 41:36.252
Nobody told you to talk!

41:36.327 --> 41:38.887
I told you to sit!

41:38.963 --> 41:41.090
I need to talk to her.

41:41.165 --> 41:47.001
You got no needs. You got
no wants. You got no rights.

41:47.071 --> 41:49.869
If you want answers, I suggest
you let me talk to her.

41:52.576 --> 41:55.238
Now, why should I do you
any favors?

41:57.281 --> 42:00.409
If I find out the truth,
who's doing who the favor?

42:06.390 --> 42:08.381
Alone.

42:13.430 --> 42:15.625
Step into my office.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.066
Warden's got plans for you, Angel.

42:24.141 --> 42:26.336
Big plans.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
