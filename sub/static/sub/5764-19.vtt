WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:04.835
Hey! Aiden, slow down.

00:04.869 --> 00:06.704
Mom, I'm doing something.

00:06.738 --> 00:08.739
It doesn't matter.
Get downstairs and take off

00:08.773 --> 00:10.941
Those muddy boots, right now.

00:14.145 --> 00:15.980
Let me do this one.

00:16.014 --> 00:17.114
Ooh. There you go.

00:17.148 --> 00:19.750
Gross. Jacket.

00:21.953 --> 00:23.354
Aiden, slow down.

00:23.388 --> 00:25.222
You're always making me go slow!

00:25.257 --> 00:26.890
Yeah. Where is your dad?

00:26.925 --> 00:28.726
I don't know.

00:32.797 --> 00:34.331
Well, hello.

00:35.767 --> 00:36.967
For me?

00:37.002 --> 00:38.702
For you.

00:38.737 --> 00:40.037
They're beautiful.

00:40.105 --> 00:41.405
What happened to your double shift?

00:41.439 --> 00:43.173
Well, Ramirez is covering for me.

00:43.208 --> 00:44.675
Ah, I knew I liked Ramirez.

00:44.709 --> 00:47.011
Yeah. I covered for him last
month when he had a hot date,

00:47.045 --> 00:48.679
So he's just returning the favor.

00:48.713 --> 00:51.215
So you've got a hot date?

00:51.249 --> 00:54.518
Well, I do... If you say yes.

00:57.188 --> 01:00.124
Oh, uh...

01:00.158 --> 01:01.625
Sorry.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.661
Look, between my double shifts

01:03.695 --> 01:05.863
And your double career,

01:05.897 --> 01:07.231
You and I

01:07.265 --> 01:09.700
Never get to spend the
night out together, alone.

01:09.734 --> 01:12.670
Let's just do that once, tonight.
Just you and me.

01:12.704 --> 01:14.905
I'm sorry. I think I'm going
to have to take a rain check.

01:14.939 --> 01:16.307
Not another estate sale.

01:16.341 --> 01:17.508
No, it's not that.

01:17.542 --> 01:19.276
It's just, Delia's
on a really hot date

01:19.311 --> 01:21.478
And Eli has his evening lecture,

01:21.513 --> 01:23.480
Ned is cramming for midterms,

01:23.515 --> 01:24.715
So we don't have
anybody to watch Aiden.

01:24.749 --> 01:25.816
I lined up somebody else.

01:25.850 --> 01:27.251
Someone else? Yeah.

01:27.285 --> 01:28.385
It's a girl named Kelly Ferguson.

01:28.420 --> 01:29.887
You know the Davidsons
down the street?

01:29.921 --> 01:30.888
She's their new nanny.

01:30.922 --> 01:32.323
Yeah, I've seen her around.

01:32.357 --> 01:35.526
Sarah Davidson says she's the
best nanny they've ever had.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.127
I don't know. I don't know.

01:37.162 --> 01:38.896
Aiden was up all night,

01:38.930 --> 01:40.864
And he's been a crank all day.

01:40.899 --> 01:42.132
Look, when I interviewed
Kelly last week,

01:42.167 --> 01:43.801
I saw Ben have a total meltdown.

01:43.835 --> 01:45.035
She handled him like a trouper.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.570
You interviewed her?

01:46.638 --> 01:48.972
And you had this planned
since last week?

01:49.007 --> 01:50.741
Yeah.

01:50.775 --> 01:53.344
Well...

01:53.378 --> 01:56.580
I've got a hot date,
what am I going to wear?!

01:58.516 --> 02:01.018
Hi, Kelly.

02:01.052 --> 02:02.453
Come on in.

02:02.487 --> 02:04.521
Thanks. Melinda, right?

02:04.556 --> 02:05.689
Yep, that's me.

02:05.724 --> 02:07.157
Hey, Kelly. Hey, thanks for this.

02:07.192 --> 02:09.993
Let me take from you. Thanks.

02:10.027 --> 02:11.829
The last time Aiden came
over to play with Ben,

02:11.863 --> 02:13.297
He fell in love with this 3d puzzle

02:13.331 --> 02:14.398
They were working on.

02:14.432 --> 02:16.533
So I thought maybe we
could do one tonight.

02:16.568 --> 02:17.901
Oh, he's gonna love that.

02:17.936 --> 02:20.270
Aiden, would you like to
come and say hi to Kelly?

02:20.305 --> 02:23.307
Come on, Aiden,
come on, and say hi.

02:23.375 --> 02:24.842
Hi, Aiden.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.211
You smell bad.

02:27.245 --> 02:28.145
Aiden!

02:28.179 --> 02:29.146
Aiden! It's OK.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.948
It's probably the garlic and onions

02:30.982 --> 02:32.249
I was cooking with earlier.

02:32.283 --> 02:33.450
You know, they're good for you,

02:33.485 --> 02:34.852
But they're kinda stinky.

02:34.886 --> 02:37.821
Why don't I show you where
you can put your stuff?

02:37.856 --> 02:39.323
Ok.

02:40.425 --> 02:41.825
Don't you like Kelly?

02:41.860 --> 02:43.827
She's OK.

02:43.862 --> 02:44.862
Ok, well, is something wrong?

02:44.896 --> 02:46.397
I mean, does she scare you?

02:46.431 --> 02:48.465
No, mom. She just really stinks.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.368
Aiden, that is really
not a nice thing to say!

02:52.437 --> 02:53.937
How we doing here?

02:53.972 --> 02:56.473
Fine, but you can talk to
your son about his manners.

02:56.508 --> 02:58.509
Yeah. Let me show you

02:58.543 --> 03:00.110
What we were thinking
about for Aiden's dinner.

03:00.145 --> 03:01.712
Ok.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.255 --> 03:12.022
Can I be excused?

03:12.056 --> 03:14.091
I thought fish sticks
were your favorite.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.093
Only when my mom makes them.

03:16.127 --> 03:17.294
I totally get it.

03:17.328 --> 03:19.229
I could only ever eat
pb&j when my mom made it.

03:19.297 --> 03:20.631
I can make you a sandwich.

03:20.665 --> 03:23.267
I'm not hungry.

03:23.301 --> 03:24.968
Ok.

03:25.003 --> 03:26.537
Maybe later.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.602
You want to help me
with this puzzle?

03:29.636 --> 03:31.370
What is it?

03:31.404 --> 03:33.672
A volcano.

03:34.841 --> 03:37.977
My dad made me a real volcano.

03:38.011 --> 03:39.979
Smoke and lava and everything.

03:40.013 --> 03:42.214
That one's dumb.

03:42.249 --> 03:46.051
Ok, how about you tell
me what you want to do.

03:46.086 --> 03:49.021
I want to play hide and seek.

03:49.055 --> 03:52.458
That sounds great.

03:54.828 --> 03:56.028
You're it!

03:56.062 --> 03:58.264
Oh! Even better.

03:59.299 --> 04:02.868
1, 2,

04:02.903 --> 04:05.070
3, 4, 5,

04:05.105 --> 04:07.006
6,

04:07.040 --> 04:10.676
7, 8, 9,

04:10.710 --> 04:14.680
10, 11, 12,

04:14.714 --> 04:16.649
13, 14,

04:16.683 --> 04:18.784
15,

04:18.817 --> 04:21.286
16, 17,

04:21.321 --> 04:23.656
18, 19,

04:23.690 --> 04:25.005
20.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.469
Ready or not, here I come.

04:50.525 --> 04:52.126
Hey, Kelly?

04:52.160 --> 04:54.261
Help! Help!

05:14.483 --> 05:15.916
I tried to get it open, but it was stuck,
and Aiden was freaking out!

05:15.951 --> 05:17.718
Mom! Baby!

05:17.753 --> 05:18.786
Are you OK?

05:18.820 --> 05:20.921
I'm OK. Come here.

05:20.956 --> 05:22.356
I'm OK. Hey!

05:22.391 --> 05:24.558
Shh, you OK? I'm OK.

05:24.593 --> 05:25.926
I am so sorry.

05:25.961 --> 05:28.062
I didn't mean to ruin your evening.

05:28.096 --> 05:30.064
No, it's...you did the right thing.

05:30.098 --> 05:32.066
What happened?

05:32.100 --> 05:33.267
I don't know.

05:33.301 --> 05:34.635
We were playing hide and seek.

05:34.669 --> 05:37.338
I guess he must have locked
himself in the crawl space.

05:37.372 --> 05:39.573
I was screaming really loud.

05:39.608 --> 05:41.041
I know.

05:41.076 --> 05:42.309
And I couldn't get you out.

05:42.344 --> 05:45.980
The lock must have jammed,
so I called 9-1-1.

05:47.149 --> 05:48.883
How did you lock yourself in?

05:48.917 --> 05:50.484
I don't know.

05:50.519 --> 05:52.353
I didn't mean to.

05:53.688 --> 05:55.189
All right, let me
check you out, you OK?

05:56.758 --> 05:59.693
It wasn't his fault.

05:59.728 --> 06:01.028
It was hers.

06:02.264 --> 06:05.900
Keep her away from children.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.567
These boys of ours,
huh? And it's only at Walmart.

06:43.602 --> 06:46.314
Oh, I swear Ben's going to send me

06:46.315 --> 06:48.813
Into an early grave with all
of his daredevil stunts.

06:48.814 --> 06:50.526
Did Kelly tell you what happened?

06:50.570 --> 06:53.539
Uh, no, I went outside
when I heard the sirens,

06:53.573 --> 06:56.108
And then I spoke to one of the
paramedics on the way out.

06:56.143 --> 06:57.579
Did you want to talk to Kelly?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.539
She's not here today,
it's her day off.

06:59.550 --> 07:01.284
No, actually,
I wanted to talk to you.

07:01.319 --> 07:02.853
Oh.

07:02.887 --> 07:04.154
I just can't figure out how Aiden

07:04.188 --> 07:06.857
Would have locked himself
inside the crawl space,

07:06.891 --> 07:08.925
You know? It locks
from the outside,

07:08.960 --> 07:10.460
And Kelly was the only one there.

07:10.495 --> 07:12.562
Yeah, I am constantly amazed

07:12.597 --> 07:15.866
By the things that Ben
manages to get into.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.101
You really like her, don't you?

07:18.136 --> 07:20.737
Love her. Why?

07:20.772 --> 07:23.073
You, um, you didn't like her?

07:23.107 --> 07:24.541
Kind of hard to tell,
based on what happened.

07:24.575 --> 07:26.376
Oh, you were just lucky
that Kelly was there.

07:26.411 --> 07:28.078
I mean, she's good in a crisis.

07:28.112 --> 07:31.782
I have had nannies who completely
lose it in an emergency.

07:31.816 --> 07:33.250
What kind of emergencies?

07:33.284 --> 07:36.453
You know, just the usual things.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.737
Ok, a couple weeks ago,
Molly got her hands on the matches.

07:40.771 --> 07:43.706
And she lit a fire in the garage.

07:43.741 --> 07:46.809
And Kelly just happened
to be there for that?

07:46.844 --> 07:48.044
Yeah, she noticed it right away,

07:48.078 --> 07:49.378
And she put it out herself.

07:49.413 --> 07:52.081
Thank goodness Molly's fine and
the house is still standing.

07:52.116 --> 07:55.985
And then it was Kelly
who took Ben to the E.R.

07:56.019 --> 07:57.887
When he had that asthma attack

07:57.921 --> 07:59.155
A couple of weeks ago.

07:59.189 --> 08:00.323
I thought he used an inhaler.

08:00.357 --> 08:01.524
He does.

08:01.558 --> 08:03.259
And it's always right
there in that drawer,

08:03.293 --> 08:05.128
But, you know,
who knows where it went.

08:05.162 --> 08:07.396
Just disappeared.

08:07.431 --> 08:09.198
Apparently.

08:09.233 --> 08:12.502
So has anything else happened,
anything that you couldn't explain?

08:12.536 --> 08:14.337
You know, trust me.

08:14.371 --> 08:19.308
There is always an explanation
and it's called Ben and Molly.

08:19.343 --> 08:21.477
You know, don't get me wrong,
I love my kids to death,

08:21.512 --> 08:24.480
But they're a handful,
and then add a baby into this mix,

08:24.515 --> 08:25.848
And it's a lot.

08:25.883 --> 08:28.918
But Kelly can manage
all three of them.

08:28.952 --> 08:31.554
I knew that she was special

08:31.588 --> 08:33.022
By the way her
references spoke of her.

08:33.056 --> 08:34.690
References? Mm-hmm.

08:34.725 --> 08:36.659
Do you still have them?

08:37.628 --> 08:39.495
Sure.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.664
Um...

08:41.698 --> 08:43.566
Here.

08:45.435 --> 08:47.570
See for yourself.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.602
So if you could call me back
at either of those numbers,

08:52.636 --> 08:55.605
I would be really grateful.
Thank you.

08:55.639 --> 08:59.054
You don't think that nanny
would hurt a child, do you?

08:59.055 --> 09:00.000
I hope not,

09:00.001 --> 09:01.684
But the ghost seems to think so.

09:01.685 --> 09:03.557
What did your neighbor
say about her?

09:03.558 --> 09:05.124
She keeps raving about her,

09:05.125 --> 09:07.651
Even though, you know,
the house almost burned down

09:07.652 --> 09:09.453
And one of the kids ended
up in the emergency room.

09:09.487 --> 09:10.621
Yikes.

09:10.655 --> 09:11.822
What about her references?

09:11.856 --> 09:13.857
I haven't heard back
from any of them.

09:13.892 --> 09:15.125
I mean, the minute
that I even suggested

09:15.160 --> 09:16.560
That Kelly might be a
part of what happened,

09:16.594 --> 09:18.796
Sarah shut me down. Oh, well.

09:18.830 --> 09:20.531
That doesn't really
surprise me. Really?

09:20.565 --> 09:22.533
I mean, wouldn't you want to
know if your nanny was dangerous?

09:22.567 --> 09:24.301
Yeah, some people
are really defensive

09:24.336 --> 09:26.637
About their childcare situation.

09:26.671 --> 09:27.905
Even when it's bad.

09:27.939 --> 09:29.306
Hmm. Yeah, I guess it
could be hard to hear

09:29.341 --> 09:30.541
That there's a problem.

09:30.575 --> 09:32.810
Yeah, sure. Because
admitting there's a problem

09:32.844 --> 09:34.478
Means admitting there's
a failure as a parent,

09:34.512 --> 09:37.214
And some people just prefer denial.

09:37.248 --> 09:39.550
I guess I just never really thought
Sarah was that kind of mom.

09:39.584 --> 09:42.353
Well, maybe she isn't. You know,

09:42.387 --> 09:44.488
Maybe Kelly really is the
best thing since sliced bread.

09:44.522 --> 09:46.991
Ghosts have been known to
lie to you in the past.

09:47.025 --> 09:48.726
True, but this time
it involves kids,

09:48.760 --> 09:50.627
And I just really
don't want to wait.

09:50.662 --> 09:52.830
Well, listen,
if you really want the 411

09:52.864 --> 09:54.598
On all of the nannies in Grandview,

09:54.632 --> 09:56.433
All you gotta do is
go down to the park,

09:56.468 --> 09:57.935
Schmooze all the other nannies,

09:57.969 --> 10:00.471
And I'm sure they'll
dish the dirt with you.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.874
My mom told me to tell you

10:03.908 --> 10:07.911
That the moms are over there,
and the nannies are over there.

10:10.648 --> 10:12.516
See ya.

10:17.689 --> 10:20.124
It really makes the egg
salad taste like this?

10:20.158 --> 10:21.925
Just a little paprika.

10:21.960 --> 10:22.893
Wow!

10:22.927 --> 10:25.596
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

10:25.630 --> 10:28.932
You know, I've actually been
interviewing nannies all week,

10:28.967 --> 10:31.001
And, uh, my current frontrunner

10:31.036 --> 10:32.503
Is Kelly Ferguson.

10:34.239 --> 10:35.572
You know her?

10:35.607 --> 10:37.708
I've definitely heard of her.

10:37.742 --> 10:39.743
Good things, bad things?

10:41.446 --> 10:42.980
Look, I'm kinda new to this,

10:43.014 --> 10:46.050
And her current references
don't give me much to go on.

10:46.084 --> 10:48.752
Well, sometimes what they don't say

10:48.787 --> 10:50.421
Is just as important
as what they do.

10:50.455 --> 10:52.256
Let me guess... her references

10:52.290 --> 10:55.793
Were positive but vague, not glowing,
but not negative, either?

10:55.827 --> 10:57.628
Yeah.

10:57.662 --> 10:58.929
Pretty much.

10:58.963 --> 11:01.498
The kids Kelly takes care
of have a lot of accidents.

11:01.533 --> 11:03.567
Accidents? Like what?

11:03.601 --> 11:06.270
Like the little girl who
almost drowned in the bathtub.

11:06.304 --> 11:07.805
Kelly left her alone?

11:07.839 --> 11:09.606
What I heard was,

11:09.641 --> 11:12.743
Kelly claimed that she'd let
the water out of the tub,

11:12.777 --> 11:15.512
And didn't know the little
girl went back in the bathroom.

11:15.547 --> 11:17.481
That's the kind of
story you hear a lot

11:17.515 --> 11:18.782
When Kelly's name comes up.

11:18.817 --> 11:20.851
I also heard, one of her kids

11:20.885 --> 11:22.386
Actually fell out a window...

11:22.420 --> 11:24.188
While she was supposed
to be watching him.

11:24.222 --> 11:25.923
How does that happen?

11:32.130 --> 11:33.597
Aiden. Mmm.

11:33.631 --> 11:36.667
Come on. Don't play with that.

11:36.701 --> 11:39.036
That's what Kelly smelled like.

11:41.473 --> 11:43.574
She smelled like beer?

11:43.608 --> 11:45.142
Mm-hmm.

11:45.176 --> 11:47.578
So you think she's
been drunk on the job?

11:47.612 --> 11:48.846
It would explain

11:48.880 --> 11:50.147
How a kid could fall out a window

11:50.181 --> 11:51.381
While she was watching him.

11:51.416 --> 11:52.716
Oh, my God. Is he OK?

11:52.750 --> 11:53.984
I don't know.

11:54.018 --> 11:55.152
I don't even know if it's true.

11:55.186 --> 11:56.353
For all I know, it's just grist

11:56.387 --> 11:57.421
For the nanny rumor mill.

11:57.455 --> 11:58.722
But if it were that,

11:58.756 --> 12:00.190
Why isn't the ghost saying so?

12:00.225 --> 12:01.825
We gotta get a handle on this.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.627
You know, I finally heard back
from one of her references,

12:03.661 --> 12:05.796
This guy Gil Bradley.

12:05.830 --> 12:08.899
He said that he could sit
down and talk with me and Jim.

12:08.933 --> 12:10.567
It's been a while since
Kelly worked for us.

12:10.602 --> 12:12.870
I'm sure she has some
more recent references.

12:12.904 --> 12:14.071
Oh, she does. Have a seat.

12:14.105 --> 12:15.439
We're just careful when
it comes to nannies.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.773
I understand.

12:18.143 --> 12:20.611
Um...did you feel safe

12:20.645 --> 12:22.446
Leaving your child with Kelly?

12:22.480 --> 12:24.781
I work in an E.R., so I'm, uh,

12:24.816 --> 12:26.550
I don't know, I'm a little
too sensitive about safety.

12:26.584 --> 12:28.018
You know, I've seen a lot
of household accidents,

12:28.052 --> 12:29.319
Stuff like that.

12:29.354 --> 12:32.222
Are you asking if my kid
was ever hurt in her care?

12:32.257 --> 12:33.390
Yeah.

12:33.424 --> 12:34.992
Oh, no, no, never. No, never.

12:35.026 --> 12:37.628
Is that your wife?

12:37.662 --> 12:39.263
My wife.

12:40.932 --> 12:42.766
Yes.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.101
Her name was Laura.

12:44.135 --> 12:46.870
She died almost 2 years ago.

12:46.905 --> 12:49.773
I'm so sorry.

12:49.807 --> 12:51.441
Was it sudden?

12:51.476 --> 12:53.710
She'd been ill.

12:53.745 --> 12:54.978
That's actually why we hired Kelly,

12:55.013 --> 12:57.681
So she could help out with
Emily when Laura got sick.

12:59.417 --> 13:01.618
Um, I hope you don't...

13:01.653 --> 13:03.420
I hope you don't mind me prying,

13:03.454 --> 13:05.489
But did they get along,

13:05.523 --> 13:06.857
Your wife and Kelly?

13:06.891 --> 13:08.425
Oh, yeah.

13:08.459 --> 13:10.294
I mean, I think so.

13:10.328 --> 13:12.129
To be honest, that whole time

13:12.163 --> 13:14.264
Is kind of a big blur.

13:14.299 --> 13:16.867
But Kelly, she helped us out a lot.

13:16.901 --> 13:18.202
But you still let her go?

13:18.236 --> 13:19.770
Yeah, after Laura died,

13:19.804 --> 13:21.638
I got a job that allowed
me to telecommute

13:21.673 --> 13:23.006
So I could just stay
at home and work

13:23.041 --> 13:24.241
And be here for Emily,

13:24.275 --> 13:26.410
You know. I'm the only
parent she has left,

13:26.444 --> 13:29.680
So she needs me. But my decision

13:29.714 --> 13:31.248
Didn't have anything
to do with Kelly.

13:31.282 --> 13:33.450
Dad, can I sleep over at Maya's?

13:33.484 --> 13:34.685
Hey, sweetie.

13:34.719 --> 13:37.354
This is Melinda and Jim,
right? Jim.

13:37.388 --> 13:39.790
And they're here to
ask us about Kelly.

13:39.824 --> 13:42.092
You remember Kelly, don't you?

13:42.126 --> 13:45.128
Did you like having
Kelly as your nanny?

13:45.163 --> 13:47.998
She was my favorite nanny ever.

13:48.066 --> 13:51.201
Ha ha. Well, she was your
only nanny ever, right?

13:51.236 --> 13:52.436
Ok, I'll tell you what,

13:52.470 --> 13:53.870
You can spend the night at Maya's

13:53.905 --> 13:55.439
If her mom says it's OK.

13:55.473 --> 13:56.540
All right?

13:56.574 --> 13:58.208
That's her! She said

13:58.243 --> 13:59.409
She was going to call!

13:59.444 --> 14:00.811
Ok, all right. Excuse me.

14:03.248 --> 14:04.781
Oh. Oh.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.168
Did you just see something?

14:25.203 --> 14:28.472
A child's hand being
burned on a stove.

14:28.506 --> 14:30.807
Was it Emily's? I think so.

14:30.842 --> 14:33.277
Did you see her reaction
when we said Kelly's name?

14:33.311 --> 14:35.345
How could Kelly hurt her?

14:35.380 --> 14:37.347
How could she be that bad?

14:38.449 --> 14:40.651
She's a monster!

14:49.722 --> 14:51.035
I'm wiped.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.682
Hey. How did the night shift go?

14:53.683 --> 14:55.256
Ugh, long and dark.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.168
How was your night? Same.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.969
I kept thinking about
that girl and her dad.

15:01.004 --> 15:03.038
You know, if the ghost
is telling the truth.

15:03.072 --> 15:05.407
Yeah. God, I know what you mean.

15:06.776 --> 15:07.910
Could you imagine?

15:07.944 --> 15:10.179
Your wife is dying, and the person

15:10.213 --> 15:12.915
You bring in to help ends
up hurting your kids.

15:12.949 --> 15:13.982
It's just...

15:14.017 --> 15:16.251
Mel, I am so sorry

15:16.286 --> 15:18.086
I brought Kelly into this house.

15:18.121 --> 15:19.555
No.

15:19.589 --> 15:21.356
It wasn't you. I liked her, too.

15:21.391 --> 15:22.491
I guess we have our ghost to thank

15:22.525 --> 15:23.826
For warning us about her.

15:23.860 --> 15:25.594
Maybe that's why
Laura stuck around,

15:25.628 --> 15:26.962
To protect other kids from Kelly.

15:26.996 --> 15:29.264
You know, did you get a chance
to look at her autopsy report

15:29.299 --> 15:30.999
Last night? No, I didn't.

15:31.034 --> 15:32.401
But I got a friend
working in records

15:32.435 --> 15:34.403
Who said that he
would pull the file.

15:34.437 --> 15:36.104
I just want to know how she died.

15:36.139 --> 15:37.573
You know, Gil said
that she was sick

15:37.607 --> 15:39.208
And that he didn't
want to talk about it.

15:39.242 --> 15:42.010
Well, I can see why.

15:42.045 --> 15:43.712
She died of an overdose.

15:43.746 --> 15:45.681
Alcohol and barbiturates.

15:45.715 --> 15:47.082
Was it suicide?

15:47.116 --> 15:48.951
No, it was ruled accidental.

15:48.985 --> 15:52.754
She also had cirrhosis
of the liver.

15:52.789 --> 15:55.958
So her illness was
alcoholism. Yeah.

15:55.992 --> 15:57.459
Aww.

16:06.035 --> 16:08.437
No!

16:08.471 --> 16:11.640
No! No! Ok, it's going to be OK!

16:11.674 --> 16:13.675
Stop! Stop!

16:13.710 --> 16:16.178
Stop! Stop!

16:16.212 --> 16:18.647
Stop! Oh, stop!

16:18.681 --> 16:21.750
Oh, my God! Stop!

16:21.784 --> 16:22.751
Oh, my God!

16:22.785 --> 16:25.020
No, no, no, no, no!

16:25.054 --> 16:26.989
No!

16:30.493 --> 16:33.562
No, wait!

16:33.596 --> 16:36.265
What was that?

16:36.299 --> 16:38.467
***

16:38.501 --> 16:40.469
Oh, my God, Kelly!
What the hell is wrong with you?!

16:40.503 --> 16:41.603
I'm sorry!

16:41.638 --> 16:43.505
Why didn't you put it into park?

16:43.539 --> 16:44.806
I did! It must have
slipped out of gear!

16:44.841 --> 16:46.975
The engine is still running!

16:47.043 --> 16:48.076
What happened? Hey, boss,

16:48.111 --> 16:50.245
You all right? Yeah,
yeah, I'm all right.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.513
Are you drunk?

16:51.547 --> 16:53.382
Is that it? No, no!

16:53.416 --> 16:54.883
I just tried to get Maddy
out of the back seat,

16:54.918 --> 16:57.920
And it started rolling! I'm...

17:00.523 --> 17:01.924
Hey!

17:01.958 --> 17:04.526
Hey, are you OK? Shut the van off,
get it out of the road.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.994
Yeah, I'm OK.

17:08.164 --> 17:11.666
It's OK, it's OK,
you're OK, she's OK.

17:11.701 --> 17:15.237
You were right about her.
Why didn't I see it?

17:15.271 --> 17:16.405
What do you mean?

17:16.439 --> 17:17.940
I started worrying
after you came over.

17:17.973 --> 17:19.207
Remember, the other day?

17:19.242 --> 17:20.175
I remember.

17:20.209 --> 17:23.011
So I re-checked all
of her references.

17:23.046 --> 17:25.914
You know what one of them told me?

17:25.949 --> 17:30.552
They fired her because liquor was
going missing from their alcohol cabinet.

17:30.586 --> 17:32.454
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

17:32.488 --> 17:34.323
Sarah, please! I'm so sorry!

17:34.357 --> 17:36.491
I don't know what happened.

17:36.526 --> 17:38.660
I don't want you
anywhere near my children

17:38.695 --> 17:40.829
Ever again.

17:42.865 --> 17:44.132
Get out!

17:47.737 --> 17:50.405
Thank you for trying
to warn me about her.

17:53.643 --> 17:55.711
Something is not right
about this whole thing.

17:55.745 --> 17:58.347
It all seems a little
too open and shut to me.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.581
Right? Yeah.

17:59.615 --> 18:00.849
I mean, the ghost was an alcoholic,

18:00.883 --> 18:02.617
And now that's what Kelly
is being accused of.

18:02.652 --> 18:03.952
And Aiden said at the playground

18:03.987 --> 18:05.721
That he smelled beer on Kelly.
But you didn't, right?

18:05.755 --> 18:07.556
No. I didn't smell anything.

18:07.590 --> 18:09.458
But you know what,
maybe he's picking up

18:09.492 --> 18:11.460
On what the ghost
wants us to believe.

18:11.494 --> 18:13.495
Yeah. What about your vision?

18:13.529 --> 18:15.831
Well, I didn't actually see
Kelly burn Emily's hand,

18:15.865 --> 18:17.332
But if she was a good nanny,

18:17.367 --> 18:20.736
Why would the kid get all squirrelly
when I mentioned her name?

18:20.770 --> 18:22.537
Yeah, but if she was a good nanny,

18:22.572 --> 18:24.339
Why is the ghost working
overtime to make her look bad?

18:24.374 --> 18:25.974
I don't know.

18:34.784 --> 18:35.851
Hi.

18:35.885 --> 18:37.686
I know I should have called first,

18:37.720 --> 18:40.088
But I just wanted to come
by and make sure you're OK.

18:40.123 --> 18:41.757
I'm OK.

18:41.791 --> 18:44.726
A little freaked out about what
happened with Kelly at the Davidson's.

18:44.761 --> 18:46.928
Do you...

18:46.963 --> 18:49.031
Do you know them?

18:49.065 --> 18:51.133
Is there something that you want
to tell me about Laura or Kelly?

18:51.167 --> 18:54.770
Is...that maybe why you're here?

18:58.007 --> 19:00.175
I just want you to know

19:00.209 --> 19:03.445
That I value what it symbolizes,

19:03.479 --> 19:06.448
And I care about you.

19:06.482 --> 19:09.051
And I'll stand by you
now no matter what.

19:09.085 --> 19:11.520
What do you mean?

19:27.003 --> 19:29.171
We made vows.

19:29.205 --> 19:33.375
He said that he would stand
by me no matter what.

19:35.745 --> 19:37.012
It was so real,

19:37.046 --> 19:39.748
I thought that Gil had
actually come to talk to me.

19:39.782 --> 19:42.150
So you didn't know you
were having a vision?

19:42.185 --> 19:44.719
Not until I looked down and
realized it wasn't my arm.

19:44.754 --> 19:46.321
When you saw the tattoo.

19:46.355 --> 19:47.656
Yeah. That's when I knew

19:47.690 --> 19:49.658
That it was a moment between
the ghost and her husband.

19:49.692 --> 19:51.526
Wow. That must have
been disorienting.

19:51.561 --> 19:54.830
I mean, you know,
even more disorienting

19:54.864 --> 19:56.932
Than a so-called normal vision.

19:56.966 --> 19:59.167
Yeah. It was.

19:59.202 --> 20:01.570
Do you think it meant something?

20:02.905 --> 20:06.141
Ooh. So is this what
the tats look like?

20:09.378 --> 20:11.980
Yeah. Just like that. What is it?

20:12.014 --> 20:14.382
It's an ancient symbol
called a triquetra.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.651
It symbolizes commitment and unity.

20:16.686 --> 20:18.386
Ok, so why would I need to know

20:18.421 --> 20:20.755
That they had commitment tattoos?

20:20.790 --> 20:23.158
I don't know, maybe it had
something to do with her addiction.

20:23.192 --> 20:24.659
Like their commitment
to overcoming it.

20:24.694 --> 20:25.861
Could be.

20:25.895 --> 20:27.963
I mean, she did say that he
promised to stand by her,

20:27.997 --> 20:29.297
But the way that she said it

20:29.332 --> 20:31.233
Made it sound like he
had broken his promise.

20:31.267 --> 20:32.200
Well, maybe he did.

20:32.235 --> 20:33.768
Maybe she couldn't stop drinking,

20:33.803 --> 20:36.238
And he didn't want to just
watch her kill herself.

20:36.272 --> 20:38.773
Ok. So you think he wanted out?

20:38.808 --> 20:41.209
Kelly.

20:42.311 --> 20:44.479
Kelly Ferguson?

20:45.581 --> 20:46.882
Yes.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.083
I'm Kelly Ferguson.

20:48.117 --> 20:50.085
I don't know what Melinda's
told you about me,

20:50.119 --> 20:51.786
But it's probably not true.

20:51.821 --> 20:53.889
Ok. You can calm down.

20:53.923 --> 20:55.524
I know what happened with Aiden

20:55.558 --> 20:58.760
Was scary, but it was an accident.

20:58.794 --> 21:00.896
How could you poison Sarah
Davidson against me?

21:00.930 --> 21:02.998
Look, I don't know
if it's true or not,

21:03.032 --> 21:05.066
But I've heard a
lot of accusations.

21:05.101 --> 21:07.002
What accusations?

21:07.036 --> 21:09.571
Well, first, that a little
boy fell out of a window.

21:12.675 --> 21:14.609
How did you even know about that?

21:14.644 --> 21:15.877
So it's true.

21:15.912 --> 21:17.579
I don't know who
opened that window.

21:17.613 --> 21:19.147
Why weren't you watching him?

21:19.182 --> 21:20.482
I was.

21:20.516 --> 21:22.450
I just turned my back for a second,

21:22.485 --> 21:24.119
And I could have sworn
I closed that window.

21:24.153 --> 21:26.254
I'm really good about
that kind of thing.

21:26.289 --> 21:30.859
But Luke had climbed out onto
the windowsill, and fell.

21:30.893 --> 21:33.061
Luckily, it was a
ground floor window,

21:33.095 --> 21:35.230
And he fell maybe 2 feet.

21:35.264 --> 21:37.532
So he wasn't hurt. A scraped knee.

21:37.567 --> 21:39.434
That's it.

21:39.468 --> 21:42.204
Look, I know it sounds bad,

21:42.238 --> 21:45.907
And I don't know why these
accidents keep happening.

21:45.942 --> 21:50.111
But I would never,
ever hurt a child.

21:51.514 --> 21:53.915
Look, I...I know that this
is going to sound strange,

21:53.950 --> 21:57.519
But I have this gift...

22:02.592 --> 22:04.859
That I have to wrap

22:04.894 --> 22:07.262
Right away, because the customer's
going to be here any minute,

22:07.296 --> 22:09.364
So I'm really sorry that
you're having a hard time.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.468
Yeah, OK. I...

22:13.502 --> 22:15.971
I'm sorry to bother you.

22:19.909 --> 22:21.209
Well.

22:21.244 --> 22:23.912
Now we know why the ghost
wanted you to see the tattoo.

22:23.946 --> 22:24.980
Yeah.

22:25.014 --> 22:27.115
'cause it wasn't Gil and Laura,

22:27.149 --> 22:28.583
It was Gil and Kelly.

22:28.618 --> 22:30.318
They were having an affair.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.547
Why am I watching

22:38.581 --> 22:39.882
a child attack a pinata?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.467
That's not just any child.

22:41.501 --> 22:43.903
That's Emily Bradley at
her sixth birthday party,

22:43.937 --> 22:45.638
3 years ago, before Kelly
went to work for her.

22:45.672 --> 22:46.939
Where'd you get it?
Good job, Emily!

22:46.974 --> 22:49.041
I got the link from Blanca
from the nanny mafia.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.376
She was the Freeman's
nanny whose daughter...

22:50.410 --> 22:51.777
Yeah, OK, got it.

22:51.812 --> 22:54.413
You notice anything unusual?

22:55.482 --> 22:56.916
Hmm, for an alcoholic,

22:56.950 --> 22:59.085
She puts up a good front.

22:59.119 --> 23:01.387
Mm-hmm. Unless the
drinking came later,

23:01.421 --> 23:02.989
After nanny dearest
entered the picture.

23:03.023 --> 23:05.491
See, she and hubby got
a little too cozy,

23:05.525 --> 23:06.826
And the wife starts
tossing back Martinis.

23:06.860 --> 23:08.995
Ugh, I feel for her,
but at some point,

23:09.029 --> 23:10.296
She's gonna have to own
up to her addictions

23:10.330 --> 23:11.864
So she can cross into the light.

23:11.899 --> 23:13.332
Amen, hallelujah.

23:13.367 --> 23:14.400
I love you, too. Hold on.

23:14.434 --> 23:15.935
Go back a bit.

23:15.969 --> 23:17.937
Make it louder.

23:17.971 --> 23:20.072
Missed it.

23:25.646 --> 23:26.612
Love you, mommy.

23:26.647 --> 23:28.814
I love you, too.

23:28.849 --> 23:30.483
What do you see?
It's not what I see,

23:30.517 --> 23:32.051
It's what I hear. Listen.

23:32.085 --> 23:34.186
Muah! Happy Birthday.
I can't believe you're 6!

23:34.221 --> 23:38.291
Laura's voice, it's clear,
not raspy like the ghost.

23:39.359 --> 23:41.260
Well, she oded, right?

23:41.295 --> 23:42.528
Maybe they pumped her stomach

23:42.562 --> 23:43.829
And stuck one of those tube
thingies down her throat.

23:43.864 --> 23:45.865
No, she was dead on arrival.

23:45.899 --> 23:47.515
I just wonder if
there's anything in

23:47.516 --> 23:49.402
Her autopsy report
that could explain it.

23:52.539 --> 23:54.073
Ok.

23:54.107 --> 23:58.010
Baker, Bloom, Bohen, Bradley.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.780
Come to papa.

24:03.383 --> 24:04.784
Ooh.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.620
Jim! Ah.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.822
Dr. Boyd. Can I help
you with something?

24:09.856 --> 24:12.558
You know, you were just the
person I was looking for.

24:12.592 --> 24:15.328
I've got this new patient
that I'm having trouble

24:15.362 --> 24:18.130
Getting through to, because
he's a severe alcoholic, and...

24:18.165 --> 24:20.366
You thought the sight of
a diseased liver might

24:20.400 --> 24:21.834
Scare him into rehab.

24:21.868 --> 24:24.570
Yeah.

24:24.604 --> 24:27.540
Treating the patient,
not just the disease.

24:27.574 --> 24:28.941
That's old school.

24:28.976 --> 24:31.610
I like it.

24:31.645 --> 24:33.512
Thanks.

24:37.918 --> 24:40.186
An irritated esophagus,

24:40.220 --> 24:42.355
That definitely explains
the raspy voice.

24:42.389 --> 24:44.557
But how can an overdose cause it?

24:44.591 --> 24:47.193
Well, she could have
aspirated on her own vomit.

24:47.227 --> 24:49.428
Uh, drowned on it.

24:49.463 --> 24:50.563
Ugh, sorry I asked.

24:50.597 --> 24:52.164
Yeah, well, her nasal passages

24:52.199 --> 24:53.499
Were also badly inflamed,

24:53.533 --> 24:55.935
But I can't see a
direct cause for it.

24:55.969 --> 24:57.670
Well, it's a start.
Now I just have to convince Aiden

24:57.704 --> 25:00.206
To get off his computer
and ready for his bath.

25:01.308 --> 25:02.742
Wish me luck.

25:02.776 --> 25:05.578
Aiden, bath time.

25:05.612 --> 25:07.780
I'm right here, mommy.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.337
Help!

25:31.371 --> 25:33.472
When chloramine gas
touches the water

25:33.507 --> 25:35.908
In your eyes and nose, it burns.

25:35.942 --> 25:38.511
The burning spreads
down your throat,

25:38.545 --> 25:40.579
Then you can't breathe.

25:40.614 --> 25:44.817
If somebody doesn't come soon,
you'll die.

25:44.851 --> 25:47.887
Nanny says nighty night.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.790
Sleep tight.

25:55.729 --> 25:58.097
Aiden!

25:58.131 --> 25:59.298
Aiden!

25:59.332 --> 26:00.533
Aiden!

26:01.768 --> 26:04.370
Is it time for my bath?

26:04.404 --> 26:07.039
In a minute.

26:08.842 --> 26:11.644
You gave me this vision,
didn't you?

26:11.678 --> 26:13.746
You were poisoned.
Is that what happened?

26:13.780 --> 26:16.549
She wanted my husband
all to herself.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.934
There were these really awful fumes

26:24.935 --> 26:26.101
Making it hard to breathe.

26:26.102 --> 26:28.101
I was coughing,
my eyes were watering.

26:28.102 --> 26:30.257
Sounds like acute
respiratory distress.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.702
Well, there was definitely something
distressing about it to me,

26:32.736 --> 26:35.405
And Aiden, he said
something about chloramine.

26:35.439 --> 26:38.508
Wow. That's normal
for a 5-year-old.

26:38.542 --> 26:40.510
You said you saw cleaning
products where you were.

26:40.544 --> 26:42.011
Now, if you mix ammonia and bleach,

26:42.046 --> 26:43.880
They create chlorine gas.

26:43.914 --> 26:45.214
Ok, so what is chloramine?

26:45.249 --> 26:47.283
Well, it's poisonous for one thing.

26:47.317 --> 26:48.785
Especially in an enclosed space.

26:48.819 --> 26:49.952
If she breathed that in,

26:49.987 --> 26:51.220
That would explain the damage

26:51.255 --> 26:53.222
To her esophagus
and nasal passages.

26:53.257 --> 26:55.324
And what about the
ghost's raspy voice?

26:55.359 --> 26:56.893
I mean, is that what killed her,
or was it the overdose?

26:56.927 --> 26:58.861
It could have been both.
But, I mean, if she was drunk,

26:58.896 --> 27:00.596
Then breathing in the gas
would have made it even worse,

27:00.631 --> 27:02.432
'cause her central nervous
system's already depressed.

27:02.466 --> 27:04.267
Right. Before I passed out,

27:04.301 --> 27:07.737
Aiden said,
"nanny says nighty night."

27:07.771 --> 27:09.472
You think she killed her?

27:09.506 --> 27:10.873
Well, the ghost seems to think so,

27:10.908 --> 27:12.175
And if Gil and Kelly
were having an affair,

27:12.209 --> 27:13.776
Maybe they both had a hand in it.

27:13.811 --> 27:15.411
Well, why aren't they together now?

27:15.446 --> 27:16.813
It's been 2 years since she died,

27:16.847 --> 27:19.282
More than enough time
to keep up appearances.

27:19.316 --> 27:20.516
So do you think there's
anything in here

27:20.551 --> 27:21.651
That could prove
Laura was murdered?

27:21.685 --> 27:23.553
No, I don't think so.

27:23.587 --> 27:25.154
I mean, the painkillers and the
booze are in the tox screen,

27:25.189 --> 27:26.989
You can see that,
but chloramine gas

27:27.024 --> 27:28.491
Is basically undetectable.

27:49.046 --> 27:52.381
You're making a big mistake.

27:52.416 --> 27:54.751
All I know is I can't
stay in Grandview anymore.

27:54.785 --> 27:57.120
People are talking about me,
saying terrible things.

27:57.154 --> 27:58.488
Who?

27:58.522 --> 27:59.689
Because no one knows anything.

27:59.723 --> 28:01.290
They don't know anything.

28:01.325 --> 28:02.859
There's this woman, Melinda.

28:02.893 --> 28:05.194
She's been asking around about me.

28:05.229 --> 28:07.396
What?

28:07.431 --> 28:09.065
I talked to her. She came
by here with her husband.

28:09.099 --> 28:10.733
I thought they were
looking to hire you.

28:10.768 --> 28:13.936
She's not gonna stop until she
gets what she's looking for!

28:13.971 --> 28:16.372
Listen, the worst thing you can do

28:16.406 --> 28:17.607
Right now is leave, OK?

28:17.641 --> 28:19.175
It'll just raise more questions.

28:19.209 --> 28:22.011
And think about Emily.
She's got school

28:22.045 --> 28:24.280
And friends,
and she's got a life here.

28:24.314 --> 28:26.249
I don't want to uproot her.

28:26.283 --> 28:29.919
You know, she's been
through enough already.

28:29.953 --> 28:33.156
And we've made it this far

28:33.190 --> 28:35.591
Without anybody
finding out about us.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.260
Let's just keep it that way.

28:37.294 --> 28:39.228
Ok?

28:40.531 --> 28:42.331
It's from the medical
file Jim found.

28:42.366 --> 28:45.568
I don't get it. This is the same

28:45.602 --> 28:47.336
As Kelly's tattoo.

28:47.371 --> 28:49.739
Didn't you say in your
vision that Gil had one, too?

28:49.773 --> 28:52.108
Yeah. All three of them have it.

28:52.142 --> 28:53.876
Why would they all
have the same tattoo?

28:53.911 --> 28:55.344
Were they swingers?

28:55.379 --> 28:57.046
Not quite. But I did
realize something

28:57.080 --> 28:58.571
When I looked through
Laura's files.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.034
She was from Beldon.

29:00.068 --> 29:01.635
Why does that name sound
so familiar to me?

29:01.670 --> 29:04.471
You probably saw it on
every tabloid talk show.

29:04.506 --> 29:08.842
There have been multiple raids
on polygamous sex in the region.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.956
He was married to both of them.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.401
Sure seems that way.

29:12.435 --> 29:14.669
Although if they're all
married to each other,

29:14.704 --> 29:16.671
Then he wasn't actually
cheating on Laura.

29:16.706 --> 29:18.373
Well, no, I mean,
you could be married,

29:18.408 --> 29:19.875
But there still could
be some jealousy.

29:19.909 --> 29:23.111
But if so, why was she
only haunting Kelly?

29:23.146 --> 29:25.080
Why not go after Gil as well?

29:25.114 --> 29:28.049
They'll both pay
for their betrayal.

29:28.084 --> 29:31.353
How did they betray you?

29:31.387 --> 29:34.289
She's gone. But she's
threatening them both.

29:34.323 --> 29:35.624
I mean, I have to warn them.

29:35.658 --> 29:38.226
I have no idea where Kelly lives.

29:38.261 --> 29:40.595
Maybe you could start with Gil.

29:40.630 --> 29:42.230
Yeah, on my way.

29:42.265 --> 29:44.099
I am getting a really bad headache.

29:44.133 --> 29:45.667
Do you smell that?

29:47.470 --> 29:49.671
Oh, yeah. What is that?

29:49.705 --> 29:52.040
Is it a gas leak?

29:52.074 --> 29:54.943
It's not the oven. Ah, here we go,

29:54.977 --> 29:56.211
We got a little spill here.

29:56.245 --> 29:59.473
Oh. Well, I'll get some towels,
can you open the window?

29:59.474 --> 30:00.962
Yeah, yeah.

30:02.585 --> 30:03.819
Oh.

30:04.721 --> 30:05.720
What the...

30:05.721 --> 30:07.789
Ugh!

30:08.300 --> 30:09.466
Well, that's weird.

30:09.501 --> 30:10.701
What's weird?

30:10.735 --> 30:13.103
The more I soak it up,

30:13.138 --> 30:14.204
The more it spreads.

30:15.607 --> 30:18.475
Why is it stuck? What the hell?

30:18.510 --> 30:21.011
Can you get some more towels?

30:21.046 --> 30:23.447
It's stuck. Did you say something?

30:23.481 --> 30:25.215
More towels! Hey, hey, hey.

30:25.250 --> 30:26.917
Forget it, forget it,
forget it, come on!

30:26.952 --> 30:29.153
Come here, come here.

30:29.187 --> 30:30.254
Let it go, we're getting
you out of here.

30:30.288 --> 30:31.588
Come on!

30:31.623 --> 30:34.258
I'm gonna get the door.

30:36.828 --> 30:38.195
What is going on?

30:39.431 --> 30:41.365
The door's locked!

30:41.399 --> 30:43.067
It's locked from the outside!

30:45.136 --> 30:46.470
I don't get it!

30:46.504 --> 30:48.505
It's like we're trapped!

30:57.048 --> 30:59.016
Kelly, Kelly!

30:59.050 --> 31:00.250
Hang on, hang on, honey.

31:00.285 --> 31:01.919
Hang on, just breathe.

31:01.953 --> 31:03.587
Hang on, Kelly.

31:03.655 --> 31:06.757
Kelly, Kelly! Hey,
don't close your eyes!

31:06.791 --> 31:07.758
Kelly!

31:07.792 --> 31:10.160
Kelly!

31:38.256 --> 31:40.657
You're reached Professor Eli James.

31:40.692 --> 31:41.792
Please leave me a message.

31:41.826 --> 31:43.494
Eli, it's Melinda.

31:43.528 --> 31:44.528
Listen, uh,

31:44.562 --> 31:47.331
I'm at the Bradley's.
I'm by myself,

31:47.365 --> 31:50.801
And I'm starting to just
get a little freaked out.

31:50.835 --> 31:54.571
Oh, the door's open,
but nobody's home.

31:54.606 --> 31:56.206
I don't...

31:56.241 --> 31:58.409
I don't have a good
feeling about this one.

32:00.745 --> 32:02.679
Can you meet me over here?

32:28.606 --> 32:30.474
9-1-1, yes, hello? Hello?!

32:30.508 --> 32:32.743
Hello, yes, I need an
ambulance right away, please,

32:32.777 --> 32:35.145
At 5426 cravens.
There are two people

32:35.180 --> 32:36.647
Locked inside a gassed house,

32:36.681 --> 32:38.749
And they are not moving!
Is there an intruder?

32:38.783 --> 32:41.251
No, not that I'm aware of,
but please!

32:41.286 --> 32:42.920
Can you send someone
over here right away?

32:48.359 --> 32:50.294
No!

32:55.967 --> 32:57.968
Laura?

32:58.002 --> 32:59.369
What's happening?

32:59.404 --> 33:00.971
You're dying.

33:01.005 --> 33:02.573
How's it feel?

33:02.607 --> 33:05.309
No!

33:08.300 --> 33:09.952
No!

33:11.000 --> 33:12.701
Melinda, where are you?

33:12.735 --> 33:14.002
Over here!

33:25.190 --> 33:26.376
She's not breathing!

33:26.377 --> 33:27.230
The ambulance is on its way.

33:27.231 --> 33:30.372
Come on, Kelly, you can do this!

33:30.800 --> 33:32.162
She's not breathing!

33:32.612 --> 33:34.417
She's not breathing!

33:34.418 --> 33:35.231
Kelly...

33:35.232 --> 33:36.539
Kelly, fight it!

33:37.300 --> 33:39.961
Come on, fight it, Kelly!

33:39.962 --> 33:43.331
Fight it, fight it!

33:43.667 --> 33:45.073
Fight!

33:45.074 --> 33:47.334
Fight, Kelly, fight!

33:48.060 --> 33:49.077
Please! Kelly, Kelly!

33:57.600 --> 33:58.929
I saw her!

33:58.930 --> 34:01.214
I know, it's OK.
It's going to be OK.

34:01.215 --> 34:02.752
She thinks I killed her.

34:02.753 --> 34:04.675
Shh, shh.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.402
Paramedics are on their way.

34:07.436 --> 34:10.338
Shh, it's OK.

34:11.739 --> 34:13.942
So Laura's the one who
caused all those accidents

34:13.976 --> 34:15.844
With the kids I was looking after?

34:15.878 --> 34:17.712
I don't think she meant
to threaten any children.

34:17.746 --> 34:19.313
She just wanted to punish you.

34:19.348 --> 34:23.016
But then why hurt Gil?
He could have died.

34:23.052 --> 34:26.054
She saw you two together,
thought you wanted her gone.

34:26.946 --> 34:29.393
Laura died of an overdose.
It was an accident.

34:29.395 --> 34:31.273
Wasn't just drugs and
alcohol that killed her,

34:31.274 --> 34:32.467
She was poisoned,

34:32.469 --> 34:34.518
By ammonia and bleach
mixed together.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.353
I don't understand.

34:36.355 --> 34:38.260
One of you must have been cleaning.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.242
Oh, my God.

34:42.338 --> 34:46.373
I remember the day she
missed Emily's soccer game.

34:46.408 --> 34:47.443
Where's mom?

34:47.444 --> 34:49.871
She was supposed to be
at my game. She was?

34:49.871 --> 34:52.931
She promised! And she was
supposed to drive us home.

34:52.931 --> 34:55.440
Emily, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

34:55.725 --> 34:56.726
It's all right.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.801
I wish you were my mother.

35:00.510 --> 35:03.069
No, sweetheart, you don't.

35:03.866 --> 35:06.222
Let me go tell your
mom you're home.

35:06.223 --> 35:08.192
Maybe she's feeling better today.

35:12.116 --> 35:13.686
Laura?

35:14.546 --> 35:16.265
Laura?

35:17.600 --> 35:20.569
I found her passed out
upstairs in the bathroom.

35:20.603 --> 35:22.971
It wasn't the first time she'd
gotten sick and tried to cover it up.

35:23.005 --> 35:24.973
We're gonna get you up, OK?

35:25.007 --> 35:26.841
And I helped her.

35:26.876 --> 35:28.443
Here we go.

35:28.477 --> 35:30.779
I put her down just
outside the bathroom.

35:33.282 --> 35:34.683
I'm gonna go check on Emily.

35:39.121 --> 35:41.556
I didn't know I was closing
her in with the fumes.

35:43.993 --> 35:47.629
I didn't realize... I never knew.

35:47.663 --> 35:49.431
Yeah, you played a bigger
role in that family

35:49.465 --> 35:51.066
Than just taking care of Emily.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.168
What do you mean?

35:53.202 --> 35:54.803
I saw your tattoo.

35:54.837 --> 35:56.805
Gil and Laura have them, too.

35:56.839 --> 35:58.440
What was going on between
the three of you?

35:58.474 --> 36:00.909
I'm not sure you can understand,

36:00.943 --> 36:03.645
If you didn't grow up where we did.

36:05.548 --> 36:07.549
The way we did.

36:07.583 --> 36:08.984
Yeah? Try me.

36:09.018 --> 36:11.786
I knew Gil and Laura
since I was a kid.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.421
I saw them fall in love.

36:13.456 --> 36:16.558
I...I saw them get away.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.860
She means from the town
that we grew up in;

36:18.894 --> 36:21.663
The way our families were.

36:21.697 --> 36:23.331
Polygamy, is that what you wanted?

36:23.366 --> 36:26.101
Is that why Laura was so unhappy?

36:26.135 --> 36:27.535
You mean, is that why Laura drank.

36:27.570 --> 36:29.237
Well, I'm sorry to say this, but...

36:29.271 --> 36:31.740
It was the other way around.

36:31.774 --> 36:34.776
Laura nearly broke her
back in a skiing accident,

36:34.810 --> 36:37.846
And she healed miraculously,

36:37.880 --> 36:39.347
But she had constant pain.

36:39.382 --> 36:41.883
And she got hooked
on the medication.

36:41.917 --> 36:44.552
When I found out that she
was still taking the pills

36:44.587 --> 36:48.657
Months after the injury,
she agreed to stop.

36:48.691 --> 36:51.926
But the pain just never went away.

36:51.961 --> 36:54.896
So she started drinking.

36:56.532 --> 36:59.267
And she couldn't stop.

36:59.301 --> 37:01.536
Emily!

37:01.570 --> 37:03.371
Although she tried.

37:03.406 --> 37:05.507
I can't tell you
how hard she tried.

37:05.541 --> 37:08.743
She needed help. And so did I.

37:08.778 --> 37:13.314
And that's when Kelly
came into our lives.

37:13.349 --> 37:16.051
My mom had come to visit.

37:16.085 --> 37:19.487
She could see what was happening,

37:19.522 --> 37:22.691
And she thought she
could help us all.

37:22.725 --> 37:24.292
And that's why she brought Kelly.

37:27.530 --> 37:30.231
I was supposed to marry someone.

37:30.266 --> 37:32.300
He had 2 wives already.

37:32.334 --> 37:35.469
So when the chance to live in a
normal family came up, I took it.

37:35.470 --> 37:37.837
Yeah, but then you just
became Gil's second wife,

37:37.838 --> 37:39.405
So how is that any different?

37:39.406 --> 37:40.940
I mean, did you even love him?

37:40.974 --> 37:43.709
I loved both of them,
but not in the way you're implying.

37:43.743 --> 37:46.512
You made a commitment to her.
I saw the tattoos.

37:46.546 --> 37:47.880
Right, well,
at first those were just

37:47.914 --> 37:50.276
A symbol to convince Kelly's family

37:50.280 --> 37:52.781
That she hadn't turned
her back on their faith.

37:52.816 --> 37:55.884
And then a strange thing happened.

37:55.919 --> 37:58.921
We fell back on what we knew.

37:58.955 --> 38:02.024
And not in any romantic sense,

38:02.058 --> 38:05.627
But...there was a union there,

38:06.000 --> 38:09.903
And we were all part of it.

38:10.740 --> 38:12.485
They're lying.

38:12.486 --> 38:14.627
Yes, I did drink.

38:14.628 --> 38:16.753
And my death may have
been an accident,

38:16.754 --> 38:18.814
But they both wanted me gone.

38:18.815 --> 38:20.604
How did they lie?

38:20.610 --> 38:22.712
Is she here?

38:22.746 --> 38:24.980
She's angry.

38:25.015 --> 38:27.016
I saw them.

38:27.050 --> 38:29.118
I woke up in the
middle of the night

38:29.152 --> 38:32.321
And I heard voices,
and I went downstairs.

38:32.356 --> 38:36.659
And I heard you whispering.

38:36.693 --> 38:38.361
Laura can't know.

38:38.395 --> 38:40.529
I couldn't tell what
they were saying,

38:40.564 --> 38:42.865
But they were very close.

38:42.899 --> 38:46.268
She saw you two together one night.

38:46.303 --> 38:47.903
She heard you whispering.

38:47.938 --> 38:50.506
Oh. I know exactly the
night she's talking about,

38:50.540 --> 38:52.641
'cause there's only one.

38:52.676 --> 38:56.345
It's a 3 month detox program.

38:56.380 --> 38:58.814
The clinic said the intervention

38:58.849 --> 39:01.083
Has got to really catch
her off guard, you know.

39:03.387 --> 39:05.855
I can't lose her,

39:05.922 --> 39:08.824
And I am.

39:08.859 --> 39:10.726
I'm losing her.

39:10.761 --> 39:12.561
Shh.

39:13.697 --> 39:15.831
Laura can't know.

39:15.866 --> 39:17.500
I'm here for you and Laura,

39:17.534 --> 39:19.235
Whatever help you need.

39:20.404 --> 39:21.937
So you were...

39:21.972 --> 39:23.756
You were both just
trying to help her.

39:23.757 --> 39:26.190
Yeah, I love Laura.

39:28.011 --> 39:30.279
I always did.

39:30.313 --> 39:35.384
And nothing she could do
would ever change that.

39:35.419 --> 39:39.722
I didn't know.

39:39.756 --> 39:42.391
I didn't realize.

39:42.426 --> 39:46.061
He never gave up on me.

39:46.096 --> 39:48.130
No.

39:48.165 --> 39:51.534
And Kelly, she was just
trying to help you.

39:51.568 --> 39:53.836
But I didn't. I just made it

39:53.870 --> 39:56.238
Easier for her to keep drinking.

39:56.273 --> 39:58.674
No, that's not true.

39:58.708 --> 40:02.411
You took care of my
child and my home,

40:02.446 --> 40:05.748
And you were there for my
husband when he needed you.

40:05.782 --> 40:09.618
And for that, I tortured you.

40:09.653 --> 40:12.455
I wish there was something I
could do to make it up to you.

40:12.522 --> 40:14.319
She's very grateful

40:14.320 --> 40:15.934
For what you did,
and she wishes that

40:15.935 --> 40:18.200
There was some way she
could make it up to you.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.101
She already did.

40:21.136 --> 40:23.437
Laura and Gil both did.

40:23.471 --> 40:26.240
They showed me what was possible.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.143
What do you mean?

40:29.177 --> 40:31.612
It wasn't that I didn't
question the way we were raised.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.669
We know most people
don't live like that.

40:35.703 --> 40:38.238
But marriage,

40:38.273 --> 40:41.508
I understood how sometimes
it takes more than 2 people

40:41.543 --> 40:42.929
To make a family work;

40:42.930 --> 40:44.628
To survive.

40:45.067 --> 40:49.574
But I always wondered where
the love was in that equation.

40:49.975 --> 40:51.490
And I'd never seen it.

40:51.500 --> 40:55.336
Never really seen love
like that between 2 people,

40:55.371 --> 40:58.506
Until I spent time
with Gil and Laura.

40:58.541 --> 41:03.078
So now why would I
want anything less?

41:03.112 --> 41:06.648
Even if it means turning
my back on what I know,

41:06.682 --> 41:10.251
I'm not scared anymore.

41:11.954 --> 41:13.421
Neither am I.

41:13.456 --> 41:15.156
Please.

41:15.191 --> 41:17.926
Tell my little girl
that I love her,

41:17.960 --> 41:20.829
And that I'm sorry.

41:20.863 --> 41:25.867
And tell her that I want Kelly
to be a part of her life.

41:25.901 --> 41:29.237
She's family.

41:29.271 --> 41:31.873
She wants you to tell
Emily that she loves her.

41:33.409 --> 41:35.910
And she wants you to be
a part of Emily's life.

41:35.945 --> 41:38.179
I will.

41:38.214 --> 41:39.814
I promise.

41:39.849 --> 41:42.984
Laura.

41:43.018 --> 41:44.786
You're the only one.

41:50.292 --> 41:51.926
I know.

42:01.437 --> 42:03.438
She's gone.

42:05.474 --> 42:08.743
Thank you.

42:12.648 --> 42:14.349
I'm coming!

42:14.383 --> 42:16.451
I'll be right there, hang on.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.387
Hello. Ooh!

42:19.421 --> 42:21.389
Gosh, don't you look handsome?

42:21.457 --> 42:23.091
What, did you think I
was going to forget

42:23.125 --> 42:24.692
About our rain check date night?

42:24.727 --> 42:28.963
No. That would be me who spaced.

42:28.998 --> 42:30.431
What do you think? Gourmet meal,

42:30.466 --> 42:33.301
First rate movie with
state of the art seating,

42:33.335 --> 42:35.403
And an irresistible
companion, tonight.

42:35.437 --> 42:38.339
It sounds... Irresistible.

42:38.374 --> 42:40.275
But I'm exhausted.

42:40.309 --> 42:42.277
And I was just hoping
to do something low-key,

42:42.311 --> 42:44.112
You know, where we didn't
have to leave the house.

42:44.146 --> 42:46.714
Well, who said anything
about leaving the house?

42:46.749 --> 42:49.083
Garcon.

42:49.118 --> 42:51.219
Dinner is served.

42:53.489 --> 42:55.757
Come on, buddy.

42:55.791 --> 42:59.994
Your first course is a
salad and a jell-o cup.

43:01.230 --> 43:02.297
Whoa, whoa!

43:02.331 --> 43:04.299
Whoa, let me get
that for you there.

43:04.333 --> 43:05.300
Thank you, cowboy.

43:05.334 --> 43:06.568
Madame. Thank you.

43:06.602 --> 43:09.137
Ranch or bleu cheese?

43:09.171 --> 43:11.339
Daddy likes bleu cheese,
but it's stinky.

43:11.373 --> 43:13.074
Well, thank you for
the recommendation.

43:13.108 --> 43:15.543
I'm going to take ranch.

43:15.578 --> 43:17.345
Sir.

43:17.379 --> 43:19.280
Daddy washed the lettuce

43:19.315 --> 43:22.050
And I spun it dry,
and I added the goldfish.

43:22.084 --> 43:23.985
Well, it's the best salad

43:24.019 --> 43:25.153
I've ever seen.

43:25.187 --> 43:27.455
You're just saying that. No!

43:27.489 --> 43:28.890
I'm not, I'm not.

43:28.924 --> 43:30.325
The salad and the two of you,

43:30.359 --> 43:31.693
It's...

43:31.727 --> 43:33.895
The best ever.

43:33.929 --> 43:35.638
Come on, ladies first.

43:35.639 --> 43:38.088
Ok, let's try the salad.

43:38.089 --> 43:40.782
Yeah, the goldfish
are my favorite, too.
