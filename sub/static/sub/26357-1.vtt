18:57.832 --> 18:59.355
Don't tell anyone I said that.

18:59.399 --> 19:03.011
Well, if there is a God,
from what I know,

19:03.054 --> 19:04.665
said God will forgive you

19:04.708 --> 19:07.233
if you truly have remorse
in your heart.

19:07.276 --> 19:08.408
Well, thanks, Lis.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.236
Don't tell anyone
I asked you that.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.412
I did it 'cause you're
the smartest person I know.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.327
And don't tell anybody
I said that.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.632
I won't!

19:15.676 --> 19:17.591
[both screaming]

19:19.114 --> 19:21.812
[sighs] Dad must have raked
the leaves today.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.858
Now that'sa miracle.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.478
I made it.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.438
Gal Gadot?!

19:38.481 --> 19:40.396
They like me so much,
I get to visit.

19:40.440 --> 19:44.444
I made it, too, boy, and
Jesus really wants to meet you.

19:44.487 --> 19:45.662
Go on in!

19:45.706 --> 19:47.316
Where are you going?

19:47.360 --> 19:50.232
This place is so boring.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.713
FLANDERS: Time for another game
of "Mother, May I?"

19:52.756 --> 19:55.106
[groaning]:
Oh!

19:55.150 --> 19:57.283
Please send me back to Earth.

19:57.326 --> 20:00.503
Yes, yes. You can be a turtle
or a pharmaceutical CEO.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.070
Turtle, please.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.724
Hmm.
