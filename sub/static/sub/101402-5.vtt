Sorry, sweetheart,

who are you?

00:44.020 --> 00:47.210
Oh, you're handsome,

00:47.250 --> 00:49.000
aren't you?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Fuck it.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Cheers, mate.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Wait, where are the police?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.691
See, they wanted me to plant

01:05.731 --> 01:06.980
a tracker on you guys

01:07.020 --> 01:08.605
but I knew they were

01:08.645 --> 01:10.000
full of shit, so,

01:11.000 --> 01:12.240
I stuck it in Mrs. D's

01:12.280 --> 01:12.980

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
No harm done.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.269
You have two minutes

01:28.309 --> 01:29.000
to explain.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.320
And it better be good.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Okay.

01:37.000 --> 01:37.980
Kim.

01:38.020 --> 01:39.486
There is this TV show

01:39.526 --> 01:40.980
called  Crystal Maze.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.438
And at the end,

01:42.478 --> 01:43.980
all the players,

01:44.020 --> 01:45.929
they have to stand

01:45.969 --> 01:46.548
in this big fucking

01:46.588 --> 01:47.980

01:48.020 --> 01:48.383
-Right.

01:48.423 --> 01:50.103
-Oi, just give him a chance!

01:52.000 --> 01:54.734
And they... they blow all these

01:54.774 --> 01:55.980
bits of silver

01:56.020 --> 01:56.980
and gold shit into your face

01:57.020 --> 01:59.616
but the trick is you only

01:59.614 --> 02:01.000
the gold ones to win.

01:59.656 --> 02:02.000
have to catch

02:02.000 --> 02:04.272
If you catch the silver ones,

02:04.312 --> 02:05.000
you lose.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.980
Okay, you can kill him.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.400
Wait, wait, wait, okay.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
[grunts softly]

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I went to the police because...

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
since, uh, Dad died,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.854
I've just been fucking lost

in the crystal wind.

02:37.796 --> 02:37.856
help me separate

02:37.896 --> 02:39.980
the gold from the silver

02:40.020 --> 02:40.609
is that kid standing

02:40.649 --> 02:41.369
right there.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.514
Look, man, my loyalties

02:46.554 --> 02:48.000
are to Nicky and Beth.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.229
And he wasn't exactly gonna

02:51.269 --> 02:52.980
save himself, was he?

03:02.020 --> 03:02.980
Yeah! That would be...

03:03.020 --> 03:04.338
No, I mean, I think you're nice

03:04.378 --> 03:04.980
and everything.

03:05.020 --> 03:05.486
-I think you're nice.

03:05.526 --> 03:06.786
-Oh, thanks. [laughs]

03:07.000 --> 03:08.206
I just mean in the same way

03:08.246 --> 03:08.369
that I think that

03:08.409 --> 03:08.980
that candle is nice.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.259
-Yeah, that's a lovely candle.

03:26.000 --> 03:26.980
And I'm sorry.

03:27.020 --> 03:27.935
But when I realized

03:27.975 --> 03:28.980
what they were up to,

03:29.020 --> 03:31.000
I unbottled it.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.540
[Jay] Whoa, what the fuck

03:57.580 --> 03:59.000
do they want with Beth?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Hello, Alan.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.010
Well, look what the cat

04:06.050 --> 04:06.980
dragged in.

04:07.020 --> 04:08.520
[Tina]  What do you want?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.500
I've got a cat, actually.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.980
Always bringing dead birds in.

04:21.656 --> 04:22.980
to be a gift.

04:23.020 --> 04:23.980
[chuckles]

04:24.020 --> 04:25.002
Always thought that was quite

04:25.042 --> 04:25.980

-you know what I mean?

04:26.760 --> 04:27.260
-[sighs]

04:28.000 --> 04:28.520
You've got your money

04:28.560 --> 04:28.980
and your fall guy.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.085
Why are we even having

04:30.125 --> 04:30.980
this conversation?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.987
No. Because your little pal

04:33.027 --> 04:34.980
let the cat out of the bag.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.657
Terri now knows that Ian

04:36.697 --> 04:37.980
did not kill Jimmy,

04:38.020 --> 04:39.357
and the money is nowhere

04:39.397 --> 04:40.057
to be seen.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
[whispers] You kept the money?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.980
Oh, my God.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.022
[Brooks]  So, now I need you

04:49.062 --> 04:50.622
to bring me a little gift.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.021
Otherwise it won't be me

04:52.061 --> 04:52.980
calling you next time.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.739
And Terri is a lot more vicious

04:54.779 --> 04:56.099
than her dad ever was.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay.

04:59.000 --> 04:59.491
Meet me at Carl's Caff

04:59.531 --> 04:59.980
in a couple of hours.

05:00.020 --> 05:01.980
I'll send you the location.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.980
You'll get your money

05:04.020 --> 05:06.000
and your dead little bird.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.320
I appreciate that, Jo.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I really do.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.480
[stutters] Why are they at

05:20.520 --> 05:21.980
Beth's house? Is she okay?

05:22.020 --> 05:23.030
I told you to give that

05:23.070 --> 05:24.330
money back, didn't I?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.080
Now's your chance.

05:28.000 --> 05:28.980
Go and get it.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.000
We're leaving.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.980
Roger that, Mum.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.132
And for the record I'm still

05:56.172 --> 05:56.980
super angry with you.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.131
[Tina]  Roger that, Kim.

Okay, please don't ask

06:02.151 --> 06:02.980

06:03.020 --> 06:04.122

06:04.162 --> 06:04.620
I've had the chance

06:04.660 --> 06:04.980
to answer.

06:05.020 --> 06:06.085
-It's really annoying.

06:06.125 --> 06:06.980
-[Tina] Copy that.

Completely understood.

06:07.654 --> 06:07.980
Over and out.

06:08.020 --> 06:09.766
You just spoke right over me.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.440
I've got to do this.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.073
But then we've seriously

06:28.113 --> 06:28.390
got to start talking

06:28.430 --> 06:29.570
about the business.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.434

at the end of

06:49.016 --> 06:49.980
your messages. Out.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.000
Out.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.440
[Jay] Are you all right?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.980
What the fuck is going on Jay?

06:58.020 --> 06:59.543
I find half a million pounds

in cash,

07:00.020 --> 07:01.487
then two police detectives

with guns are in our house

07:02.092 --> 07:02.980
going through our stuff.

07:03.020 --> 07:04.683
I'm trying to make it right,

07:04.723 --> 07:04.980
okay?

07:05.020 --> 07:06.195
I was just trying to...

07:06.235 --> 07:07.135
[clicks tongue]

07:09.000 --> 07:09.955
[sighs] Look, I know

07:09.995 --> 07:10.319
you don't wanna spend

07:10.359 --> 07:11.619
the rest of your life

with the geezer off

07:13.075 --> 07:13.521

07:13.561 --> 07:13.980
I get that.

07:14.020 --> 07:15.161
[Beth]  What are you on about?

07:15.201 --> 07:15.633
You know I don't care

07:15.673 --> 07:15.980
about that.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.956
Look, I got plans for

07:17.818 --> 07:19.138
That's all I'm saying.

07:17.996 --> 07:20.000
me and you.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.215
I don't need plans, Jay,

07:22.255 --> 07:22.685
I need my boyfriend

07:22.725 --> 07:23.980
to be honest with me.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.283
Oh, you want to talk to me

07:25.323 --> 07:26.163
about honesty?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.143
All right, if we're being

07:32.183 --> 07:32.980
honest, then Beth,

07:33.020 --> 07:34.455
and you really don't care

07:34.495 --> 07:35.980
about my job and all that,

07:36.020 --> 07:39.000
then... marry me.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.980
[chuckles]  What?

07:42.020 --> 07:43.460
Yeah. Serious. Marry me.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.980
Jesus. Jay, I...

07:46.020 --> 07:46.980
Yeah, I didn't think so.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.072
Babe, please, just listen

07:48.112 --> 07:48.980
to me for a minute...

07:49.020 --> 07:50.219
All right, forget it.

07:50.259 --> 07:50.980
I have to go.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.980
[exhales sharply] All right.

08:31.020 --> 08:32.460
So, when he comes out...

08:33.000 --> 08:33.980
Could you...

08:34.020 --> 08:36.000
Could you just stop doing that?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.980
Let me do all the talking.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.399
We need the money

08:42.439 --> 08:43.980
and him in the car.

08:44.020 --> 08:44.699
-Thompson!

08:44.739 --> 08:45.980
-[chuckles] Sorry.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.000
God.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.691
'Cause I hate it when places

09:07.171 --> 09:08.311
you cheesy bastard.

09:15.000 --> 09:15.980
[Brooks] Who's that?

09:16.020 --> 09:16.571
-Fit.

09:16.611 --> 09:18.000
-Here we go.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
[coughing]

09:36.000 --> 09:37.620
Get in the car, sweetheart.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.800
I thought this was a bag drop.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.588
Well, we're not exactly

09:43.628 --> 09:44.045
gonna do it out here

09:44.085 --> 09:45.285
in the open, are we?

09:48.000 --> 09:48.441
[Nicky] Do you know what

09:48.481 --> 09:48.802
I mean, like, that's my line

09:48.842 --> 09:48.980
of argument.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.942
[Jay] Listen, this is the same

09:50.959 --> 09:51.980
that I have with tomatoes.

09:50.982 --> 09:52.020
conundrum, yeah,

09:52.020 --> 09:53.079
Oh, my God, don't get me

09:53.119 --> 09:53.980
started on tomatoes.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.563
It's like, you're not a fruit,

09:55.603 --> 09:55.980
are you?

09:56.020 --> 09:57.464
If you were, you'd be delicious

09:57.504 --> 09:57.980
and fruity.

09:58.020 --> 09:59.257
Like, don't go around

09:59.237 --> 10:00.557
"I'm not a vegetable."

09:59.297 --> 10:01.000
and be like,

10:01.000 --> 10:01.540
Yeah, do know what, listen,

10:01.580 --> 10:01.980
fuck tomatoes, innit?

10:02.020 --> 10:03.980
Fuck tomatoes!

10:04.020 --> 10:05.097
Would you two please

10:05.137 --> 10:06.097
shut the fuck...

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Where's Kim?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Oh, shit.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
There's cameras on the cafe.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.320
If you get in the car,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
we'll go somewhere quiet.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.605
[Brooks] While we're

10:26.645 --> 10:26.980
still young.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.340
Whenever you're ready.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I'll drive. You shoot.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.578
-What do you want us to do?

10:48.618 --> 10:48.980
-Oh, I don't know,

10:49.020 --> 10:50.117
maybe just take care of staying

10:50.157 --> 10:50.980
the fuck out of my face.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.352
-I'd really appreciate it.

10:52.392 --> 10:52.980
-[gun cocks]

10:53.020 --> 10:54.000
[Carl] Oi!

10:56.000 --> 10:56.980
Are you with them bastards?

10:57.020 --> 10:57.529
[Brooks] Get out of

10:57.569 --> 10:57.980
the fucking way!

10:58.020 --> 10:58.485
Not until I know

10:58.525 --> 10:59.485
what's going on.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.780
-Move!

11:00.820 --> 11:02.000
-Or what?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
[engine revs]

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
What's going on?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.017
They were gonna kill you.

11:15.057 --> 11:16.437
Could you not see that?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Take this.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Shit!

11:36.000 --> 11:37.080
[tires screeching]

11:47.000 --> 11:48.140
[Brooks] Fuck this!

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Fuck my life!

11:59.000 --> 12:00.980
[Tina] Kim, take mine.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.486
-What are you doing?

12:02.526 --> 12:03.258
-[Kim] I'm gonna ask

12:03.298 --> 12:04.078
them to stop.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.458
[Nicky] Oh, my God, oh, my God,

12:07.498 --> 12:08.158
oh, my God!

12:11.000 --> 12:11.980
Shit!

12:12.020 --> 12:13.040
[tires squealing]

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
[gunshots]

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
[Tina] Shoot the bloody tires!

12:20.000 --> 12:20.513
[Kim] I'm trying.

12:20.553 --> 12:21.453
Hold it steady.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Magazine!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.140
[gunshots continue]

12:37.000 --> 12:38.092
Watch my windscreen.

12:38.132 --> 12:38.521
Watch my fucking

12:38.561 --> 12:39.221
windscreen.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.980
Shit, shit, shit,

12:55.020 --> 12:56.040
shit, shit, shit!

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
[screaming]

13:02.000 --> 13:03.320
[exclaiming in relief]

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
[cheering]

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Fuck! Fuck it!

13:41.000 --> 13:41.734
We should find somewhere

13:41.774 --> 13:41.980
to camp.

13:42.020 --> 13:42.907
It'll be dark soon

13:42.947 --> 13:43.335
and it's still a long

13:43.375 --> 13:44.515
drive to the cabin.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.317
-Who says we're going back

13:48.357 --> 13:48.525
to the cabin?

13:48.565 --> 13:49.285
-[gun cocks]

13:50.000 --> 13:51.394
It's just somewhere safe

13:51.253 --> 13:52.573
and make a plan, okay?

13:51.434 --> 13:57.000
to lie low

13:57.000 --> 13:57.980
[gun clatters]

13:58.020 --> 13:59.001
Even you'd agree with that.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.601
Wouldn't you, dick wallet?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Dick wallet?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.205
-What's a dick wallet?

14:04.245 --> 14:04.264
-[Tina] Right,

14:04.304 --> 14:04.980
that's decided, then.

14:05.020 --> 14:07.437
We'll camp tonight and we will

14:07.477 --> 14:08.056
leave for the cabin

14:08.096 --> 14:08.980
at first light.

14:09.020 --> 14:10.000
[gun cocking]

14:14.000 --> 14:14.625
Seriously,

14:14.665 --> 14:16.000
what's a dick wallet?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.613
[Kim] I think she means

14:31.653 --> 14:31.743
some sort of

14:31.783 --> 14:32.980
dystopian future

14:33.020 --> 14:34.861
-in which money no longer

14:34.901 --> 14:35.543
means anything.

14:35.583 --> 14:35.980
-Right.

14:36.020 --> 14:38.456
-And the only currency is...

14:38.496 --> 14:39.000
-Yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.119
...for some unknown reason,

14:43.159 --> 14:43.249
the severed peni

14:43.289 --> 14:44.980
of your fallen enemies.

14:45.020 --> 14:47.222
Right, which you would carry

14:47.262 --> 14:47.658
around in some kind of

14:47.698 --> 14:48.980
bespoke, leather-bound...

14:49.020 --> 14:50.500
-Dick wallet. Exactly.

14:50.540 --> 14:50.980
-Right.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.980
Yeah, I mean, cool.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.756
But I think it would be

14:54.796 --> 14:56.000
more of a purse.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.381
You have to tell him,

14:59.421 --> 15:00.000
you know?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
About the business.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah, I could tell him...

15:08.000 --> 15:09.111
or I could just change

15:09.151 --> 15:09.980
all my life plans

15:10.020 --> 15:10.561
and start

15:10.601 --> 15:11.980
a landscaping business

15:12.020 --> 15:12.439
to avoid having

15:12.479 --> 15:12.762
that conversation.

15:12.802 --> 15:13.402
[chuckles]

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay, I'll tell him.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.679
I just need you to tell me

15:20.719 --> 15:21.290
exactly what to say,

15:21.330 --> 15:21.980
word for word.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.000
It's easy. You just...

15:25.000 --> 15:26.206
look him in the eye

15:26.246 --> 15:26.980
and you say,

15:27.020 --> 15:28.959
"Jay, you're my brother

15:28.999 --> 15:29.980
and you know

15:30.020 --> 15:32.275
-how much I love you..."

15:32.315 --> 15:32.334
-You know how much

15:32.374 --> 15:34.174
I love you and care for you...

15:35.000 --> 15:36.539
and I know this is a really

15:36.579 --> 15:38.079
hard time for you, but...

15:44.000 --> 15:44.614
I can't start a business

15:44.654 --> 15:45.494
with you, bro.

15:47.000 --> 15:47.738
I've been offered an internship

15:47.778 --> 15:48.378
in London.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.033
I'm really sorry, man.

15:50.073 --> 15:50.980
[chuckles nervously]

15:51.020 --> 15:52.064
What do I know about

15:52.104 --> 15:52.980
landscaping? Huh?

15:53.020 --> 15:53.446
With my hay fever,

15:53.486 --> 15:54.746
it would be terrible.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.440
Compost gives me a rash.

15:57.000 --> 15:57.980
I'm more of an indoor person.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.017
-I just think--

15:59.057 --> 16:00.000
-Just, just...

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
[sighs]

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I get it.

16:41.000 --> 16:41.427
You've got to do

16:41.467 --> 16:42.667
what's best for you.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.884
Don't feel bad

16:44.924 --> 16:46.000
about that, yeah?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
[sighs deeply]

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
[exhales] Thanks, man.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.087
-[Jay] Hey, at least the money

16:57.127 --> 16:58.073
is on its way home now, eh?

16:58.113 --> 16:58.980
-[Nicky chuckles]

16:59.020 --> 17:00.280
He's right, you know?

17:01.000 --> 17:01.619
[Jay and Nicky speaking

17:01.659 --> 17:02.439
indistinctly]

17:04.000 --> 17:05.214
When this is all over

17:05.254 --> 17:05.302
you should do

17:05.342 --> 17:06.422
whatever you want.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.214
Just don't undervalue

17:15.254 --> 17:15.325
what we have.

17:15.365 --> 17:15.980
That's all I ask.

17:16.020 --> 17:17.141
Okay! I'm gonna go and get

17:17.181 --> 17:17.980
some more firewood.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.100
Nicky, you coming?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.253
[exhales] You're sure

17:22.293 --> 17:22.980
you're okay?

17:23.020 --> 17:24.000
I'm fine, kid.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.409
-Go on. Go with Kim.

17:26.449 --> 17:26.980
-[sighs]

17:27.020 --> 17:28.105
-Go on, go on.

17:28.145 --> 17:29.000
-[chuckles]

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Beth's pregnant.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.380
And she didn't tell me.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.044
I mean, [scoffs]

17:54.084 --> 17:55.000
why would she?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.480
I mean, what am I really gonna

17:58.520 --> 18:00.320
offer her and a baby? [scoffs]

18:04.000 --> 18:05.044
That business was

18:05.084 --> 18:05.476
the only chance

18:05.516 --> 18:06.176
I had, man.

18:21.000 --> 18:21.782
Do me a favor.

18:21.822 --> 18:23.082
Close your eyes, Jay.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Now just imagine it's...

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
You, and Beth and the baby,

18:41.000 --> 18:42.835
and you're in a cabin

18:42.875 --> 18:44.000
in the woods.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.260
There's nothing else.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
No pressures.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
No expectations.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
No TV.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
No money.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Nothing.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Just let that all melt away.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Shit...

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
[chuckles]

19:22.000 --> 19:22.949
I'll leave that

19:22.989 --> 19:24.000
with you, champ.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.140
[cell phone chimes]

20:11.000 --> 20:12.480
[Thompson] Yeah,

20:12.520 --> 20:14.000
all right, boss.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.140
We'll let you know.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.020
[inhales sharply]

20:23.000 --> 20:23.980
That was Terri.

20:24.020 --> 20:26.000
She's sending reinforcements.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.980
She said if we don't find them

20:30.020 --> 20:31.395
then she'll take

20:31.435 --> 20:33.000
one of us instead.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.480
I used to be a good copper,

20:37.520 --> 20:38.060
you know?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.206
Life was a lot less

20:41.246 --> 20:42.000
complicated.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.260
[vehicle approaching]

20:54.000 --> 20:55.560
We're gonna find this mob.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.980
And when we do,

20:58.020 --> 20:59.460
we're gonna tell Terri that

20:59.500 --> 21:00.456
the money just [sucks teeth]

21:00.496 --> 21:01.216
disappeared.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.304
And then we're gonna split it

21:06.344 --> 21:07.244
50-50, I swear.

21:11.000 --> 21:11.443
If she finds out,

21:11.483 --> 21:12.683
she'll kill us both.

21:14.000 --> 21:14.955
I gave my whole life

21:14.995 --> 21:16.255
to Terri and her dad,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.380
if I'm gonna die alone,

21:20.000 --> 21:21.008
I'd rather it was with

21:21.048 --> 21:21.980
an eight ball of coke

21:22.020 --> 21:23.543
in a beach rental in Malibu.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.083
[scoffs]

21:28.000 --> 21:29.500
We understand each other?

21:35.000 --> 21:35.980
Fifty-fifty.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.229
And you have to promise

21:38.269 --> 21:38.920
to stop being such

21:38.960 --> 21:40.000
a grumpy prick.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.560
I think I can manage that.

21:45.000 --> 21:45.980
Thank you.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.000
Now fuck off.

22:09.000 --> 22:09.850
That was amazing!

22:09.890 --> 22:10.314
I can't believe I just

22:10.354 --> 22:10.980
said what I thought,

22:11.020 --> 22:12.728
and saying what I thought

22:12.768 --> 22:13.144
made the situation

22:13.184 --> 22:13.980
ten times better.

22:14.020 --> 22:15.202
I don't get it.

22:15.242 --> 22:15.819
Isn't that what people

22:15.859 --> 22:16.980
just do all of the time?

22:17.020 --> 22:17.980
[chuckles] No. Nobody does.

22:18.020 --> 22:19.645
Well, how do you ever tell

22:19.685 --> 22:20.980
anyone what you want?

22:21.020 --> 22:23.275
By dropping subtle hints

22:23.315 --> 22:23.666
and sighing loudly

22:23.706 --> 22:24.980
if they get it wrong.

22:25.020 --> 22:26.691
Right. So if I wanted

22:26.731 --> 22:27.980
to kiss you now,

22:28.020 --> 22:30.980
how would I go about it,

22:31.020 --> 22:32.000
in your world?

22:34.000 --> 22:34.863
You could spend

22:34.903 --> 22:35.183
six or seven months

22:35.223 --> 22:35.980
beating around the bush

22:36.020 --> 22:37.453
and then, just, drink

22:37.493 --> 22:38.426
half a bottle of vodka

22:38.466 --> 22:38.980
and then--

22:39.020 --> 22:40.520
I'd like to kiss you now.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Oh.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Please.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
My way's better.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
See?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Wow.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.041
That's number 16 well and truly

23:12.081 --> 23:14.000
crossed off the old list, eh?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.020
You read my book?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I'd say more like browsed.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Leafed, really.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.091
Dipped my toe in and thought,

23:28.131 --> 23:28.970
"Oh, God, the water's cold

23:29.010 --> 23:30.150
in there. I'm out!"

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Say something?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
You see, you can't trust him.

Kim? Kim?

23:50.020 --> 23:51.100
Nice one, dipshit.

23:55.000 --> 23:55.528
[Nicky] It's so obvious

23:55.568 --> 23:55.705
you want to take us

23:55.745 --> 23:56.765
back to the cabin

23:57.000 --> 23:57.565
so you can try and push Kim

23:57.605 --> 23:58.745
into staying there.

23:59.000 --> 23:59.441
[Tina] Oh, really?

23:59.481 --> 23:59.980
Well, what about you?

24:00.020 --> 24:00.710
You think you're so smart,

24:00.750 --> 24:00.980
don't you?

24:01.020 --> 24:02.518
You really think Kim's

24:02.558 --> 24:03.219
gonna choose you over

24:03.259 --> 24:03.980
her own mother?

24:04.020 --> 24:04.980
[Nicky] Why don't you ask her?

24:05.020 --> 24:05.885
-[Tina] Are you crying?

24:05.925 --> 24:06.980
