WEBVTT

00:26.234 --> 00:29.779
I WANT TO INFORM
ALL THE MEXICAN PEOPLE

00:29.863 --> 00:36.119
THAT JOAQUÍN GUZMÁN LOERA
HAS BEEN CAPTURED.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.954
The head of the Sinaloa cartel...

00:38.038 --> 00:40.331
President Enrique Peña Nieto,

00:40.415 --> 00:43.585
confirmed the head of the Sinaloa cartel
has been recaptured

00:43.668 --> 00:46.379
whose escape was a humiliation
to his administration.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.512
El Chapo, one
of the most wanted drug lords...

00:58.641 --> 01:01.186
He was detained in the city of Los Mochis.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.982
Mexican authorities

01:06.066 --> 01:08.485
have recaptured Guzmán.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.362
The drug lord's escape destabilized
the Mexican government.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.865
Recapturing him has even become
an affair of state.

01:13.948 --> 01:17.869
Journalists from all over the world
are here today.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.038
At the PGR's hangar

01:20.121 --> 01:22.499
at the international airport
in the City of México,

01:22.582 --> 01:27.212
on board that ANX-2226
of the Mexican Navy.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.506
We can now see Chapo
coming out of the truck.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.133
Correct. Right now,
Chapo Guzmán is being transferred.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.636
He's had a change of clothes.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.930
They are showing him to the media.

01:37.013 --> 01:40.058
They don't let him speak.
And they lower his head again.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.393
Ana Paula, they are taking him now.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.021
He is not allowed
to speak to the media.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.148
Now they're stopping.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.817
They are showing his face
to the media.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.032
Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera
Aka "El Chapo," "Chapo Guzmán"

02:56.551 --> 03:01.097
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

03:01.180 --> 03:05.435
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

03:05.518 --> 03:09.772
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

03:09.856 --> 03:15.612
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

03:16.946 --> 03:20.366
Even when the clouds drift away

03:21.075 --> 03:24.871
Even when my skin dries away

03:24.954 --> 03:28.958
I'll be back someday

03:29.959 --> 03:34.005
To unleash my return

03:38.009 --> 03:42.764
I have the dust that protects the road

03:42.847 --> 03:47.227
I have the branches of a leafless tree

03:47.310 --> 03:51.439
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:51.522 --> 03:57.195
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

03:58.196 --> 04:01.783
Even when the clouds drift away

04:02.575 --> 04:05.828
Even when my skin dries away

04:06.663 --> 04:10.833
I'll be back someday

04:10.917 --> 04:15.797
To unleash my return

04:25.723 --> 04:29.894
ALTIPLANO PRISON,
MEXICO 2016

05:08.891 --> 05:10.393
It's great!

05:12.061 --> 05:13.730
Thank you, Joaquín.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.065
There're some details missing,
but we're almost done.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.776
Next time do something
to cool this place down?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.403
Do you want me
to build you another one?

05:21.487 --> 05:23.573
A lot more, my engineer.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.366
This is only the first one.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.748
I want it finished before I return.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.459
When are you traveling?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.794
Today.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.016
I was getting bored
waiting for so long.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.771
For complaints, my wife, babe.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.690
This is my golden chance
with Mr. Miguel Ángel.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.989
Which wife?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.786
Both of them.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.750
Excuse me.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.212
What's up, engineer?

06:19.295 --> 06:21.339
Joaquín, what you're
asking for is impossible.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.257
I need more time to finish it.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.259
Too bad. We're out of time.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.470
Hey, let's go.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.138
You have to finish it.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.432
-Don't let me down.
-Joaquín.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.435
What's the hurry?
Where're you going?

06:35.561 --> 06:40.399
MEXICO CITY, HEADQUARTERS
OF THE WORKERS' INSTITUTIONAL PARTY

06:44.946 --> 06:46.781
Good morning. How are you?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.284
Yes, sir.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.163
If you say so, sir.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.499
Yes...

07:39.959 --> 07:42.670
Yes, I made the call myself.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.548
Once again, yes, sir.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.718
If the governor didn't answer,
it's not my fault.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.055
Sir, the thing is,

07:53.139 --> 07:55.600
the governor has gained
a lot of power.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.687
No, sir, I'll handle it.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.525
I've made a report on the governor.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.614
All right, sir, as you wish.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.662
JALISCO STATE GOVERNMENT

08:31.761 --> 08:35.306
If this son of a bitch gets canned,
what will happen to us?

08:36.390 --> 08:38.893
Rafael Caro Quintero was captured!

08:38.976 --> 08:42.271
Key figure in Latin American
drug trafficking,

08:42.355 --> 08:46.776
and amongst the most important
in the international drug trade.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.987
Moreover, he's presumed
to have killed the American agent

08:50.071 --> 08:51.531
Enrique Camarena Salazar

08:51.614 --> 08:54.158
and his Mexican pilot,
Alfredo Zavala Avelar.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.555
The detained drug traffickers are members

09:15.638 --> 09:16.847
of the Guadalajara Cartel,

09:16.931 --> 09:19.559
headed by Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.812
Their names are
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo,

09:22.895 --> 09:24.897
aka Don Neto.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.275
Your uncle is a badass, Amado.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.195
AMADO CASTILLO, "THE LORD OF THE SKIES"
HEAD OF JUÁREZ CARTEL

09:32.613 --> 09:35.533
...and Rafael Caro Quintero,
who has been identified

09:35.616 --> 09:37.493
as the man responsible

09:37.577 --> 09:39.120
for the torture and murder
of the DEA agent.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.497
Do you have any regrets?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.207
Well... what should I say?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.167
I never feel regret.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.378
What's done is done.
And now I'm here.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.297
What can I do?

09:49.380 --> 09:50.840
What's your relationship
with Félix Gallardo?

09:50.923 --> 09:52.717
-None.
-Do you know him?

09:52.800 --> 09:55.595
No, sir. I don't know him.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.263
Thank you, Rafael.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.432
You'll be missed.

09:59.515 --> 10:03.269
MIGUEL ÁNGEL, "THE GODFATHER"
HEAD OF THE GUADALAJARA CARTEL

10:03.352 --> 10:06.731
This unfortunate event has
stirred an unprecedented diplomatic crisis

10:06.814 --> 10:09.567
between Mexico and the USA.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.819
In 1985, the Mexican drug business
was controlled by the Guadalajara cartel

10:11.902 --> 10:15.489
The cartel was run
by Miguel Ángel, "The Godfather,"

10:15.573 --> 10:18.701
who had a group of drug lords
under his command.

10:20.161 --> 10:25.666
El Chapo was working for him with hopes
of becoming a drug lord...

10:29.670 --> 10:34.508
MIGUEL ÁNGEL'S HOUSE

10:40.014 --> 10:41.223
Set it up.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.851
What's up, Chapo?

10:43.934 --> 10:45.811
I'm on my way out.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.772
The tunnel is finished.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.942
I'm ready to throw some blow
to the other side.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.656
I can move several tons
across the border.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.991
You only have to put me
in contact with Escobar.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.581
You're trying to bite off
more than you can chew.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.419
It's the quickest and safest way
to move it across.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.924
Our man in Colombia...

11:15.007 --> 11:17.009
is Amado, not you.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.597
Leave it to him.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.266
Keep working with marijuana.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.811
And don't screw it up.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.855
There's plenty of cocaine
for everybody, Miguel Ángel.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.734
The more we move across
the border, the better.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.361
Stop with all that crap.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.614
If you really want to help
the organization,

11:38.697 --> 11:40.950
go pick Amado up at the airport.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.789
I'm not a chauffeur.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.834
You work for me.

11:49.917 --> 11:53.087
And right now,
that's what I want you to do.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.109
What now?
Working as a chauffeur now?

12:25.411 --> 12:28.789
WORKERS' INSTITUTIONAL PARTY

13:28.766 --> 13:31.268
-Amado!
-My dear Miguel!

13:31.352 --> 13:33.938
-How was your trip?
-Great.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.607
How are the guys? Fine?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.541
What's up, Barranquillero?

13:54.458 --> 13:56.627
Are we going to do
some business or not?

13:56.710 --> 14:00.130
Don't let me down.
Introduce me to Escobar.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.054
Let's go, Rayo!

14:49.138 --> 14:50.556
Barranquillero is waiting
for us. Come on!

14:50.639 --> 14:54.018
Wait a second, buddy.
I thought the boss said no.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.312
He said he wouldn't
introduce me to Escobar.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.397
He never said I couldn't
introduce myself.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.876
I hope you're sure about this.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.973
ANTIOQUIA, COLOMBIA
PABLO ESCOBAR'S ESTATE

15:47.112 --> 15:49.281
They are going to kill us, buddy.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.332
I'm Joaquín Guzmán Loera.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.674
Call Barranquillero.
We're his friends from Guadalajara.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.638
All right, partner.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.848
This is your only chance.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.976
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I've told you already.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.519
Call Barranquillero.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.272
García.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.858
Someone is looking
for Barranquillero.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.857
Is he going to see me?

17:04.940 --> 17:07.526
If not, you'd be dead already.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.582
García.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.670
This is Chapo. Chapo, García.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.173
You only get five minutes, okay?

17:41.351 --> 17:42.936
Sir.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.814
Don Pablo.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.357
Thanks for seeing me today.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.742
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.578
Barranquillero may trust you, but I don't.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.624
Do something that feels off,
and I'll kill you, son of a bitch.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.879
Miguel Ángel didn't send me here.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.714
I came on my own account.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.930
This kid turned out
to have some balls.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.224
As your people say,

18:20.307 --> 18:22.059
small but spicy.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.188
Okay, then...

18:26.271 --> 18:28.524
Tell me quickly. I don't have time.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.110
We're getting tired
of Amado's late deliveries.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.321
You're saying you can deliver faster?

18:34.404 --> 18:35.948
Exactly, Mr. Pablo.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.617
Amado delivers in five days.
I can do it in three.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.578
No, my boy.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.956
If he wants, he can do that too.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.250
He's just too damn lazy.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.877
Hey, man, take this shorty away.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.296
-Come on, move.
-Forty-eight hours.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.675
I can move it across the border
and deliver in 48 hours.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.859
Chapo...

19:13.068 --> 19:15.946
Do you know what happens
to those who fail me?

19:16.864 --> 19:18.490
Yes, Mr. Pablo.

19:20.367 --> 19:25.372
So, you can deliver
one ton in 48 hours?

19:26.456 --> 19:28.792
Prove it and we can start
talking business.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.975
We need to cross one ton.
Split it between the two airplanes.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.811
Forty-eight hours, buddy?
Are you out of your mind?

19:48.645 --> 19:49.897
Keep an eye on García.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.690
He shouldn't start counting
until the planes take off.

19:51.773 --> 19:52.774
Okay.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.277
I'll see that everything
is set to land in Cancún.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.987
All right.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.740
How is it going, García? Fine?

19:59.823 --> 20:02.075
Come on, guys!
Quick! I'm in a hurry.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.786
Take this. Come on.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.962
CANCÚN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

20:17.758 --> 20:19.259
GENERAL DIRECTOR
FEDERICO FERNÁNDEZ

20:40.739 --> 20:43.492
Rayo, can you hear me?

20:43.575 --> 20:45.869
The airport director is in.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.081
Let me know
when you are ready to take off.

20:59.716 --> 21:00.842
Guys!

21:03.553 --> 21:05.180
Hurry up!

21:05.264 --> 21:07.057
Let's go!

21:10.769 --> 21:12.521
Here he is, sir.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.148
You thought you would get away with it?

21:16.942 --> 21:20.404
-What the hell did I tell you?
-You would have done the same thing.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.074
Don't give me that shit, Chapo.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.786
It's the end of the line.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.998
Let me do this.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.167
If I'm successful, you'll have
more benefits as the boss.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.798
If I fail...

21:39.881 --> 21:41.717
I'm going to die anyway.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.553
Rules are rules.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.971
And you broke all of them.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.473
I saw the opportunity...

21:48.557 --> 21:50.600
and I just took it.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.603
Escobar is not happy
with Amado's late deliveries.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.485
If I can deliver in 48 hours,
he'll do more business with us.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.405
It's a win-win situation, Don Miguel.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.076
This son of a bitch thinks he's a badass.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.788
Let him try, Miguel.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.668
When he fails,

22:16.752 --> 22:18.879
Escobar will do us
a favor and kill him.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.315
Chapo...

22:38.398 --> 22:40.859
Do you know what happens
to those who fail me?

22:53.872 --> 22:56.374
-We'll take off in 20 minutes.
-All right, buddy.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.459
García!

22:58.085 --> 23:01.129
Welcome to Mexico!
Ready to fly to Tecate?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.924
Let me remind you
that you only have 36 hours left.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.884
I'll have time to spare,
son of a bitch.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.269
Conrado, the Party Leader
wants to see you.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.938
He's in the meeting room.

23:36.039 --> 23:40.460
WORKERS' INSTITUTIONAL PARTY

23:43.255 --> 23:45.298
Listen, guys!

23:46.007 --> 23:49.553
I sacked your useless boss
for being such an asshole.

23:51.888 --> 23:55.267
Now, I want to hear your advice.
Let's see how badass you are.

23:57.978 --> 24:01.690
The Governor of Jalisco is trying
to escape the fold.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.695
How can we avoid that?
You tell me.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.073
My advice is to reconcile, sir.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.909
If we organize a meeting
with the governor,

24:12.993 --> 24:16.288
he'll understand it's best
to stay on your side.

24:16.371 --> 24:18.165
By avoiding confrontation,

24:18.248 --> 24:22.127
his loyalty towards the party
and towards you will strengthen.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.256
Do you agree?

24:26.923 --> 24:28.592
No.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.803
In this case, I recommend
you go for the scandal.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.432
A media scandal
with the information we have

24:35.515 --> 24:38.602
that the governor was laundering
Caro Quintero's money...

24:40.687 --> 24:42.814
with that, he'll weaken for sure.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.692
We can take advantage
that the news of Quintero's arrest

24:45.775 --> 24:47.819
is fresh out of the oven.

24:48.695 --> 24:51.323
We can even threaten him
with a few days in prison...

24:54.868 --> 24:56.661
with his ex-partner.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.081
Corruption... Rafael Caro Quintero
and his partners...

25:03.335 --> 25:04.711
...tax evasion and money laundering...

25:04.794 --> 25:07.881
That would only scare him for a while.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.799
It's not going to win his loyalty.

25:09.883 --> 25:13.428
Sorry, sir, but someone
who was a traitor once...

25:14.512 --> 25:16.765
will never be loyal again.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.979
Is there something else?

25:23.063 --> 25:25.398
Yes, if I may add something,

25:25.482 --> 25:28.526
I think that by scaring him a bit
he'll return to the fold,

25:29.194 --> 25:31.821
but only a good ass-kicking
will guarantee

25:31.905 --> 25:34.199
that he'll never leave the fold again.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.467
DEADLINE FOR DELIVERY

26:04.771 --> 26:06.773
Everything okay in Guadalajara.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.244
Thank you, sir.

26:19.327 --> 26:22.664
I heard landing here
was more complicated,

26:22.747 --> 26:24.833
but so far everything is great.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.126
Great?

26:27.252 --> 26:28.920
The real fun is only starting.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.755
Let's go.

26:39.222 --> 26:42.225
Engineer, we're flying over Sonora.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.019
Get the tunnel ready.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.614
Attention, guys!
We're almost there!

26:56.698 --> 26:58.783
We're almost there?

27:00.285 --> 27:02.662
Is that the runway?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.414
That's the one!

27:07.584 --> 27:10.795
Son of a bitch!
We're going to die!

27:25.643 --> 27:27.562
-Güero.
-What's up, Joaquín?

27:27.645 --> 27:30.106
HERIBERTO "EL GÜERO" PALMA
DRUG LORD

27:30.190 --> 27:32.442
-Where are the Colombians?
-They are coming.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.904
What's he doing?
He's flying too fast.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.572
Give me the radio.

27:40.116 --> 27:41.701
The runway is not that long.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.371
You're flying too fast. Slow down!

27:44.454 --> 27:46.206
Slow down!

27:46.289 --> 27:47.874
He'll crash!

27:47.957 --> 27:50.251
Slow down! Slow down!

27:55.465 --> 27:56.883
Shit!

28:06.768 --> 28:09.354
What happened, García?

28:09.437 --> 28:11.940
-For the nerves.
-Don't make fun of me, son of a bitch.

28:12.023 --> 28:15.443
Next time, you should slow down.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.821
García, this is Güero.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.739
-Güero, García.
-What's up?

28:19.823 --> 28:21.491
-How are you?
-Fine.

28:21.574 --> 28:22.826
Wait a second.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.452
Buddy, your brother.

28:26.329 --> 28:27.497
Be more careful, next time.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.124
What's up, Pollo?

28:29.207 --> 28:31.584
You have to slow down...

28:40.927 --> 28:42.429
What's wrong?

28:43.346 --> 28:45.390
My damn father is dying.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.100
He wants to see me.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.979
-What are you going to do?
-Chapo...

28:54.858 --> 28:56.693
It's the judicial police.

28:56.776 --> 28:58.194
They're on our side.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.751
What's up, Commander?
What can we do for you?

29:12.834 --> 29:14.961
Tell your men to put the guns down.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.504
What happened, Commander?

29:16.588 --> 29:18.298
Is your payment late?

29:18.381 --> 29:21.301
I have direct orders
to seize this shit.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.554
Don't give me that shit.

29:26.389 --> 29:27.891
Direct orders from whom?

29:28.558 --> 29:30.185
You'll have to ask my boss.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.395
There's no need
to ask questions, buddy.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.063
There's enough money

29:34.147 --> 29:36.441
for you and your boss.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.027
The boss was very clear, Chapo.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.321
Put the guns down!

29:41.404 --> 29:44.115
Otherwise, you'll be
the first one to die.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.995
Put the guns down.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.335
Go ahead!

29:57.504 --> 29:59.005
All yours.

30:13.520 --> 30:17.482
DEADLINE FOR DELIVERY

30:17.565 --> 30:20.443
It's nothing personal, Chapo.
I'm just following orders.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.498
Sir, García is on the phone.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.627
Yes, sir. We are here--

30:38.586 --> 30:40.630
What an asshole!

30:40.713 --> 30:42.465
Did you tell him
we lost the packages?

30:42.549 --> 30:44.592
I couldn't.
You snatched the phone from me.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.178
Anyway, don't worry,
Pablo Escobar knows everything.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.223
-I still have 20 hours!
-Accept it, you've lost already.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.808
I still have 20 hours, right?

30:54.435 --> 30:56.688
If I can't deliver the merchandise,
I'll call your boss myself.

30:56.771 --> 30:57.897
Let's go.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.858
-Are you coming?
-Of course.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.484
Come on.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.444
Stay here with the Colombians
until we come back.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.321
-Prepare the airplanes.
-You, come with us.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.949
Hey...

31:09.909 --> 31:11.911
What about your dad?

31:11.995 --> 31:14.497
-He'll have to wait.
-Okay.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.376
Hurry up! Hurry up!

31:23.256 --> 31:26.175
SONORA, MEXICO
HEAD OF THE JUDICIAL POLICE'S HOUSE

31:45.111 --> 31:46.905
It's your choice, Director.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.616
Do you want today
to be your funeral?

31:52.869 --> 31:55.121
-Don't hurt my family.
-Don't worry.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.957
We won't hurt your family.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.876
We just want the merchandise back.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.711
The merchandise!

32:01.794 --> 32:04.547
And who was the snitch?

32:18.853 --> 32:20.855
REGARDS, EL CHAPO.

32:33.242 --> 32:36.204
This is the warehouse in the US
where the tunnel leads.

32:39.332 --> 32:42.919
-Are you sure it's finished?
-90% guaranteed.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.923
See you on the other side, Güero.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.800
See you, Chapo.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.092
Mr. Secretary.

33:51.195 --> 33:54.782
"EL CIELO" ESTATE

33:56.659 --> 33:58.661
What's up, Pollo? It's me.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.538
How's Dad?

34:01.581 --> 34:03.583
Well... you know...

34:06.002 --> 34:07.587
Your dad is waiting for you.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.798
What's holding you up?

34:12.216 --> 34:16.095
NEAR TECATE, MEXICO
MEXICO - US BORDER

34:16.179 --> 34:18.056
Right now, I can't, Mom.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.349
If I could, I would be there.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.231
Hurry up.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.776
You need to say what
you have stuck in your hearts.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.946
As soon as I can, I'll go, I swear.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.965
We're ready, Joaquín!

35:21.494 --> 35:22.578
Rayo, do you copy me?

35:26.124 --> 35:28.167
What's up, buddy?

35:28.251 --> 35:30.044
We're being followed.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.181
It's the DEA!

35:42.265 --> 35:44.433
Don't worry, the drugs are secure.

35:45.601 --> 35:48.312
They aren't after that,
they're coming after us!

35:53.067 --> 35:54.110
Speed up!

36:38.362 --> 36:39.447
Closer!

36:56.255 --> 36:58.174
Rayo! Rayo! Do you copy me?

36:58.257 --> 36:59.884
Rayo!

37:01.761 --> 37:02.970
Go!

37:04.472 --> 37:06.057
Closer! Come on!

37:10.478 --> 37:11.854
Faster, man!

37:24.700 --> 37:26.577
Don't move!

37:32.124 --> 37:33.459
What's up, Peter?

37:33.542 --> 37:37.380
DEADLINE FOR DELIVERY

37:39.507 --> 37:41.801
You're getting into trouble, man.

37:41.884 --> 37:44.470
An American cannot arrest
people in Mexico.

37:44.553 --> 37:46.806
And you shouldn't kill
a DEA agent, but you did it.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.933
Camarena's murder was
Caro Quintero's doing.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.351
And he's in prison.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.353
Why do we have to get
into trouble because of it?

37:53.312 --> 37:55.273
The only one in trouble here
is you, Chapo.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.275
I've got very strict orders.

37:57.358 --> 38:00.194
Go teach them who's in charge
so that they won't forget it.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.779
The one with bad memory
here is you.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.241
You're no longer interested
in securing your future?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.634
You said so yourself.

38:25.219 --> 38:28.347
Your retirement pension wasn't
even enough to pay for your whores.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.766
Don't worry about me.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.062
We get a bonus for each
drug lord that we capture.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.605
A ten million dollar bonus?

38:45.406 --> 38:47.033
Ten million?

38:48.034 --> 38:49.327
All yours.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.537
And five extra for your guys.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.252
Ten million.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.215
All you have to do...

39:03.299 --> 39:05.426
is forget about me.

39:47.051 --> 39:50.096
TECATE, USA

40:40.062 --> 40:41.313
Come on, guys!

40:41.397 --> 40:43.190
-Everything ready?
-Ready, sir.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.488
Hurry up! Hurry up!

40:56.245 --> 40:57.913
Pass me the packages.

40:57.997 --> 40:58.831
Rayo!

40:59.874 --> 41:02.835
The packages! In one line.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.699
-Rayo, come on!
-Come on, buddy!

41:33.782 --> 41:35.993
This is heavy...

41:36.076 --> 41:37.953
Give me that, man!

41:40.998 --> 41:43.250
Come on, quickly.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.086
Come on, faster.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.255
-Rayo!
-Careful, be careful!

41:49.173 --> 41:50.591
How many are left?

41:50.674 --> 41:51.842
Come on! Come on!

41:54.011 --> 41:55.888
We're almost done!
We're almost there!

41:55.971 --> 41:57.890
Let's see...

42:27.586 --> 42:30.923
USA - MEXICO BORDER CROSSING

43:11.463 --> 43:12.756
Are you there, Güero?

43:58.427 --> 44:00.220
What's up, buddy?

44:01.639 --> 44:03.265
Great!

44:03.349 --> 44:05.851
Okay, let's go up!
Let's start unloading this!

44:12.775 --> 44:15.486
-Come on, guys!
-Quickly!

44:24.578 --> 44:26.288
Quickly!

44:26.372 --> 44:28.207
Come on, man!

44:39.426 --> 44:41.637
Hurry up! Get down.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.018
Three hours left, Chapo.

44:50.479 --> 44:51.980
Come on, Güero.

45:30.144 --> 45:34.022
WAREHOUSE
IN LOS ANGELES, USA

45:34.773 --> 45:36.692
Delivery completed, son of a bitch.

45:40.028 --> 45:41.363
Done, Chapo.

45:41.447 --> 45:44.616
The boss will be impressed
with your work.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.708
Don Cheto.

45:52.791 --> 45:54.460
I need to go to the airport.

45:54.543 --> 45:56.044
-I'll take your car.
-Of course.

45:57.921 --> 45:59.381
Güero.

46:05.846 --> 46:08.348
Kill all the workers
who built the tunnel.

46:08.432 --> 46:10.309
Everyone, except for the engineer.

46:10.392 --> 46:12.519
No one can know where it is.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.441
Good luck with your dad.

PRESIDENTIAL PALACE
MEXICO CITY

46:43.800 --> 46:46.720
UNITED MEXICAN STATES

47:03.654 --> 47:05.405
-Good afternoon.
-Thank you.

47:36.311 --> 47:38.814
Chapo! Chapo!

47:56.290 --> 47:59.626
Pollo! I brought the airplane
to take Dad to the hospital.

48:17.811 --> 48:20.105
...in sickness and in health...

48:20.188 --> 48:22.316
Guide me, Lord.

48:22.399 --> 48:25.611
None of my enemies will...

48:25.694 --> 48:27.779
The Lord is my shepherd;

48:27.863 --> 48:29.781
I shall not want.

51:28.668 --> 51:30.378
You couldn't make it on time.

51:31.379 --> 51:35.592
I'm sorry, Mom.
What did my dad want?

51:36.593 --> 51:39.679
Why do you think?
You know him.

51:42.474 --> 51:44.684
What did he want to tell me?

51:44.768 --> 51:46.269
Did he tell you?

51:47.103 --> 51:48.563
It doesn't matter.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.524
Stop thinking about it.

51:56.696 --> 51:58.990
He only wanted to tell you that...

51:59.825 --> 52:02.202
for him you're still
just a damn servant.

52:03.078 --> 52:04.955
One more scrub working for a drug lord.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.960
