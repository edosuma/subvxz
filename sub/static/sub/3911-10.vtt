WEBVTT

00:02.190 --> 00:05.900
- <i>Previously on</i> Tyrant...
- Ahmed, I'm bleeding.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.270
<i>I can't have a baby.</i>

00:07.310 --> 00:10.220
You need to find someone
who can give you a child.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.250
We need to get our
marriage annulled.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.420
BARRY:
Molly, it's Barry.

00:14.450 --> 00:17.000
And I'm glad
you're still alive.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.660
Who is that,
your girlfriend?

00:19.690 --> 00:21.330
Is she prettier than me?

00:26.500 --> 00:28.670
Why'd you do that?

00:28.700 --> 00:31.000
Because I got tired
of waiting for you to do it.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.870
(gunfire)

00:32.900 --> 00:34.070
(Sammy gasping)

00:35.810 --> 00:38.140
In three nights time,
the meteorological service

00:38.180 --> 00:40.340
is predicting a likely
sandstorm in Ma'an.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.030
It will provide
perfect cover for us.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.180
The key to this, of course,
is getting Khalil

00:44.220 --> 00:45.670
and his Red Hand Brigade
on board.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.270
I and only I will speak
to Khalil.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.050
I need a phone number for Khalil
of the Red Hand Brigade.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.090
And what makes you think
I would have such a thing?

00:53.120 --> 00:55.250
RAMI: <i>I'm fairly sure you don't,
but I'm also fairly sure</i>

00:55.290 --> 00:56.530
<i>that you can get it.</i>

00:56.570 --> 00:58.110
JAMAL:
<i>You met with Khalil</i>

00:58.140 --> 01:01.400
<i>after I explicitly
ordered you not to.</i>

01:01.430 --> 01:03.290
I want him dead.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.240
(footsteps approaching)

01:13.280 --> 01:14.880
MAHMOUD:
Mr. President?

01:14.910 --> 01:17.110
Sir?

01:18.250 --> 01:19.780
Mr. President?

01:21.720 --> 01:23.420
Mr. President!

01:23.450 --> 01:25.620
No! No!

01:25.660 --> 01:27.120
Sir!

01:27.160 --> 01:28.420
Mr...

01:38.170 --> 01:40.670
I'm so... sorry, Mr. President.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.140
Y-You didn't respond.

01:44.010 --> 01:45.970
Tell me the plan.

01:46.010 --> 01:48.140
General Sayid is briefing
his soldiers

01:48.170 --> 01:49.780
later this morning at the base.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.650
When his motorcade passes,

01:51.690 --> 01:53.750
my operative
will detonate an IED.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.120
This operative
is the only one you've told?

01:57.150 --> 01:59.220
- Yes.
- You trust him?

01:59.250 --> 02:01.220
He is my nephew.

02:01.260 --> 02:04.990
And the evidence
will implicate the Caliphate?

02:05.030 --> 02:06.100
I'll be running
the investigation,

02:06.140 --> 02:10.060
so the evidence will prove
whatever you want proven.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.000
Your loyalty will be
rewarded, Mahmoud.

02:13.030 --> 02:14.670
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.070
But, I-I would be remiss
if I did not ask you...

02:18.110 --> 02:20.010
Ask me what?

02:20.040 --> 02:23.380
If it isn't better to wait

02:23.420 --> 02:26.280
until after
the counteroffensive.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.150
After, it will be too late.

02:28.180 --> 02:30.950
After is when he will make
his move against us,

02:30.990 --> 02:34.020
when he will try
to steal the presidency.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.360
(sighs)

02:37.190 --> 02:38.790
You think...

02:38.830 --> 02:41.910
you think it's easy for me,
spilling my own blood,

02:41.940 --> 02:44.630
killing my own son?

02:44.670 --> 02:47.330
He's left me no other choice.

02:47.370 --> 02:50.480
This is the only way
I can protect our country,

02:50.520 --> 02:52.770
protect Leila and Ahmed.

02:53.610 --> 02:56.180
I understand, sir.

03:01.180 --> 03:04.040
I blame myself.

03:04.070 --> 03:08.090
Letting Rami into my life
was a fool's errand.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.330
Thinking it would somehow
make up for

03:11.370 --> 03:14.290
all the years
he needed a father.

03:14.330 --> 03:16.530
(chuckles)

03:20.830 --> 03:23.770
- Where are you now?
- The desert,

03:23.810 --> 03:25.470
with the clan
of one of our fighters.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.840
And your fighters...
how many survived?

03:26.870 --> 03:30.040
Enough to take the antiaircraft
battery from the Caliphate,

03:30.080 --> 03:31.780
just like your plan calls for.

03:31.810 --> 03:34.000
Taking the battery is one thing.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.490
Holding onto it until our planes
can land is another.

03:36.530 --> 03:39.380
Khalil, you should expect
heavy casualties.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.550
We know the risk.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.330
We'll scrub them.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.760
That comes off.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.270
What about what's in my head?

03:54.300 --> 03:56.070
When does that go away?

03:56.100 --> 04:00.000
If it ever does,
I'll let you know.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.840
So you've...

04:03.710 --> 04:06.480
I'm sorry about Ru'a.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.460
I don't know how small

04:11.500 --> 04:13.650
the town was
that you came from.

04:13.690 --> 04:16.589
South Pasadena?
Not so small.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.589
Very protected
and scrubbed clean.

04:20.620 --> 04:23.060
Tal Jiza had 500 people,

04:23.090 --> 04:25.500
and I always thought
if I could slip away

04:25.530 --> 04:28.530
and see just a bit
of the world.

04:28.570 --> 04:31.090
I wanted to get out
of Pasadena so bad.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.200
(scoffs)

04:33.240 --> 04:35.430
There's a lot to see,
isn't there?

04:35.460 --> 04:38.070
I had no idea.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.880
What about my father?

04:41.910 --> 04:44.080
What has he seen?

04:48.850 --> 04:51.490
Yeah, I can tell.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.760
He won't talk about it.

04:53.790 --> 04:56.620
I don't think
he'll ever talk about it.

04:56.660 --> 04:59.090
Sammy.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.630
I'm fine.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.130
I'm fine, don't worry.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.420
I'm fine.

05:19.380 --> 05:20.680
Amira, it's Molly.

05:20.710 --> 05:21.960
Molly, dear.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.880
I-I'm so sorry
I haven't called you.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.890
Don't be silly.
I'm the one who should apologize

05:25.920 --> 05:27.550
for not calling you.

05:27.590 --> 05:30.060
But so much has been happening.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.460
I know.
We have a lot to catch up on.

05:32.490 --> 05:33.830
I'm glad everything
is being resolved

05:33.860 --> 05:36.300
with-with Sammy's inheritance.

05:36.330 --> 05:38.980
How is he?

05:39.010 --> 05:40.430
He's...

05:40.470 --> 05:41.900
He's fine.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.740
That's actually
why I'm calling you.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.070
I need to ask a favor.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.670
Uh, our visas are about
to expire.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.980
I'm hoping you can help us
get an extension.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.910
An extension?

05:52.950 --> 05:54.590
But why?

05:54.630 --> 05:56.710
I'd have... I'd have thought
you'd want to get out of here

05:56.750 --> 05:59.320
as soon as you settled
the estate.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.290
Amira, something's come up,

06:01.320 --> 06:04.660
which is why I'd prefer to not
do this through normal channels.

06:04.690 --> 06:06.960
And-and I'd rather not talk
about this over the phone.

06:06.990 --> 06:09.830
Are you all right, dear?

06:11.630 --> 06:13.400
Tell me.

06:13.430 --> 06:16.570
I will, if you have time
to see me.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.760
I can...

06:18.790 --> 06:21.240
come to your hotel
later this morning.

06:21.270 --> 06:23.810
That'd be great. Thank you.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.810
I'm looking forward
to seeing you.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.620
We have to stop meeting
like this.

06:33.650 --> 06:35.620
We will, actually.

06:35.650 --> 06:38.190
The doctor finally
cleared me to fly.

06:39.770 --> 06:42.130
- Good news.
- Yeah, so...

06:42.160 --> 06:45.400
I'm leaving for London
the day after tomorrow.

06:47.150 --> 06:50.090
Maybe after this is all over...
the Caliphate business...

06:50.130 --> 06:53.370
in six months,
I'll look you up.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.670
I spent a lot of time
in London on weekends

06:55.710 --> 06:58.440
during my Sandhurst days.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.340
I know places.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.350
I'm sure you do.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.660
I'm going to try and
find my own places

07:05.700 --> 07:07.780
that are just mine.

07:10.580 --> 07:14.160
Why don't you find someone
without baggage?

07:15.990 --> 07:19.960
Someone to settle down
and start a family with.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.360
Is that what this is about?

07:26.020 --> 07:30.110
I've spent my life in places
with different names for hell.

07:30.140 --> 07:32.370
Darfur, Burundi, Ma'an.

07:32.410 --> 07:36.650
You really think I want to
bring a child into this world?

07:38.160 --> 07:41.240
Six months from now,
if your doorbell rings

07:41.280 --> 07:45.090
and you're not
expecting anybody,

07:45.120 --> 07:47.600
don't be surprised if it's me.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.570
♪

08:22.390 --> 08:24.020
(horse whinnying)

08:35.370 --> 08:36.840
(clicks tongue)

08:36.870 --> 08:38.140
(whispers):
Yah.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.950
♪

09:23.780 --> 09:25.980
Aye.

09:27.070 --> 09:29.270
Mr. President.

09:31.290 --> 09:33.260
What are you doing here?

09:33.290 --> 09:34.830
Waiting for you.

09:34.860 --> 09:37.060
Your meeting at the base.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.380
- I postponed it.
- Postponed it? Why?

09:39.410 --> 09:41.730
To avoid any further
miscommunication between us.

09:41.770 --> 09:43.430
I wanted you to sign off
on the operation

09:43.460 --> 09:44.700
before we deploy.

09:44.730 --> 09:46.310
We can still make
changes if you like.

09:46.340 --> 09:49.940
But I saw your motorcade
leaving the palace.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.500
Yeah. Grandmother...
M-Mrs. Al Fayeed...

09:52.540 --> 09:53.950
she had a meeting
in the city.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.650
I told my driver
to take her.

09:58.020 --> 10:00.960
So if we could just
discuss this.

10:02.050 --> 10:03.550
Not now.

10:03.590 --> 10:05.020
It won't take long.

10:05.060 --> 10:07.430
We're working
on a very tight time frame.

10:12.660 --> 10:14.530
(line ringing)

10:14.560 --> 10:18.900
Come on, Mahmoud,
pick up the phone.

10:18.930 --> 10:20.140
WOMAN (recorded):
This is the private voice mail

10:20.170 --> 10:22.010
of Colonel Mahmoud Al-Ghazi.

10:22.050 --> 10:23.790
Leave a message.
(beep)

10:33.110 --> 10:35.540
(phone ringing)

10:36.650 --> 10:38.390
Yes?

10:38.420 --> 10:39.760
Mother. (chuckles)

10:39.790 --> 10:41.120
Jamal?

10:41.160 --> 10:44.590
Uh, listen, I need
to see you right away,

10:44.630 --> 10:48.940
so have the driver turn around
and come back to the palace.

10:48.970 --> 10:50.220
What's this about?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.690
I-I will tell you
when you I see you,

10:52.730 --> 10:56.690
but tell the driver to
turn around and get back here.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.510
If it's so important,
why can't you just tell me now?

10:59.550 --> 11:01.580
Because I can't.

11:04.450 --> 11:06.710
Jamal, I-I'm worried about you.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.720
W-Whatever this is about,

11:09.750 --> 11:11.050
just tell me.

11:11.090 --> 11:14.010
There is a bomb on the road.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.010
A bomb?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.670
Yes, a bomb.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.590
So tell the driver
to stop the car

11:19.630 --> 11:22.750
and turn around now!

12:50.370 --> 12:53.770
You know you were supposed
to get visual confirmation?

12:53.800 --> 12:56.140
I-I had the itinerary
a-and motorcade route.

12:56.180 --> 12:57.740
What other confirmation
could I have gotten?

12:57.780 --> 12:59.230
Plus the windows
were tinted!

12:59.270 --> 13:00.870
She was the president's mother,
you know.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.550
W-We killed
the president's mother.

13:04.980 --> 13:08.050
You know, J-Jamal called me.

13:08.090 --> 13:10.750
On my private number,
right before.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.320
I missed his call because
I was taking a shit.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.490
(phone ringing)

13:20.500 --> 13:22.500
Yes?

13:23.300 --> 13:25.520
Yes.

13:25.550 --> 13:27.870
Mr. President, I...

13:31.140 --> 13:34.480
Uh, he wants to see me.

13:34.510 --> 13:36.950
Yeah, yeah.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.140
Uncle, if you
want me to...

13:41.720 --> 13:45.690
I kept an account for you
in a Zurich bank, eh?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.820
In the event that something
like this might happen.

13:47.860 --> 13:52.740
Now that it has,
you need to leave Abuddin.

13:52.780 --> 13:54.330
- Hmm?
- Uncle...

13:54.360 --> 13:56.530
Go.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.860
Talk to me,
Jamal, please.

14:17.890 --> 14:21.050
Not now.

14:22.190 --> 14:24.360
There is a gathering
in the residence.

14:24.390 --> 14:27.130
It will help to be
with other people, with family.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.700
I don't need any help.

14:28.740 --> 14:33.000
I understand you are in pain,
but we need to talk about this.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.640
I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. President.

14:35.670 --> 14:37.140
I-I didn't mean to interrupt.

14:37.170 --> 14:38.740
Come in, Mahmoud.

14:38.770 --> 14:41.270
Uh, Leila, will you
please leave us?

14:41.300 --> 14:45.140
Mahmoud is here to brief
me on the investigation.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.310
A little late, isn't it?

14:47.350 --> 14:49.930
It would've been much better if
you gathered your intelligence

14:49.960 --> 14:52.080
before this
happened, not after!

14:52.120 --> 14:53.700
Leila.

14:53.730 --> 14:54.720
What?

14:54.760 --> 14:56.460
I'm afraid, okay?

14:56.490 --> 14:58.690
I'm mourning,
but I'm afraid, too.

14:58.730 --> 15:01.890
If the Caliphate can reach us
here, what else can they do?

15:03.060 --> 15:04.660
How close are they?

15:04.700 --> 15:06.990
Am I a prisoner
in my own home?!

15:07.030 --> 15:09.000
Will you be quiet?

15:09.040 --> 15:11.100
Give me a
few minutes

15:11.130 --> 15:13.930
with Mahmoud,
and I will join you later.

15:16.450 --> 15:18.620
(sighs)

15:38.560 --> 15:40.800
Let me choose my own end.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.400
I would like to die
with some dignity.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.070
I don't want to end up
like General Tariq.

15:45.100 --> 15:48.470
Mahmoud, you don't need
to fear me anymore.

15:48.510 --> 15:51.410
You are the only
one I can trust.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.380
I loved her.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.890
She loved me,
in spite of all my faults.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.250
But why did she
have to bring Rami

16:02.290 --> 16:03.610
into the Palace?

16:03.650 --> 16:06.560
That was the start.

16:06.590 --> 16:09.530
That was the mistake.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.500
(sighs)

16:11.530 --> 16:14.630
We still need to deal with Rami.

16:14.670 --> 16:16.990
And you said
the evidence will prove

16:17.020 --> 16:20.040
what we need it to prove, right?

16:20.070 --> 16:22.240
(panting softly)

16:28.180 --> 16:30.150
AHMED:
Mother.

16:30.180 --> 16:31.980
Where is Father?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.990
He... he needs time alone.

16:37.020 --> 16:39.290
- I should go see him.
- N...

16:39.320 --> 16:42.790
I want you to stay here
with Nusrat.

16:42.820 --> 16:44.310
We need to be good
to each other today.

16:44.350 --> 16:45.460
We need to be

16:45.490 --> 16:48.530
stronger together.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.270
(sighs)

16:51.300 --> 16:53.310
Come.

17:02.340 --> 17:06.010
NUSRAT: I've decided to delay
my flight to-to London

17:06.050 --> 17:09.150
until after the funeral,
if that's all right with you.

17:09.180 --> 17:11.119
Of course.

17:15.660 --> 17:19.130
I'm wearing the bracelet that
she gave us after the wedding.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.190
Do you remember,
Ahmed?

17:20.230 --> 17:22.630
Yes.

17:26.490 --> 17:28.660
It was meant for me.

17:32.170 --> 17:34.740
To target you like that...

17:37.910 --> 17:42.750
At least we know that the
Caliphate are growing nervous.

17:42.780 --> 17:45.320
I wouldn't bet on it.

17:45.350 --> 17:48.390
That's not their style.

17:48.420 --> 17:50.500
Besides, how would
they manage an IED

17:50.530 --> 17:53.990
so close to Palace grounds?

17:54.030 --> 17:56.590
Perhaps they've got someone
working at the Palace.

17:56.630 --> 17:57.600
No.

17:57.630 --> 17:59.610
You're barking up

17:59.650 --> 18:01.500
the wrong tree.

18:01.530 --> 18:04.500
What?

18:05.310 --> 18:07.170
MAHMOUD:
General Said!

18:08.340 --> 18:10.590
Yes?

18:10.620 --> 18:11.980
You are under arrest
for the murder

18:12.010 --> 18:13.950
of Amira Al Fayeed!

18:15.250 --> 18:18.450
You better have evidence
of this.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.070
What possible motive
do I have for

18:20.110 --> 18:21.090
killing the woman that I love

18:21.120 --> 18:22.220
most in this world?!

18:22.250 --> 18:23.790
Ask the president that

18:23.830 --> 18:24.760
when you see him!

18:24.790 --> 18:26.520
Ask yourselves,
if we've come to this,

18:26.560 --> 18:28.480
who's safe now?

18:29.640 --> 18:32.020
You've arrested
the general of our military!

18:32.050 --> 18:33.860
On the orders
of the president, yes.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.600
In the middle of a war?!

18:35.630 --> 18:38.200
For the murder
of his own grandmother?!

18:39.040 --> 18:40.290
I don't believe this, Mahmoud.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.710
This is crazy!

18:41.740 --> 18:42.910
It wasn't his grandmother

18:42.940 --> 18:45.290
he was trying
to assassinate, madam.

18:46.110 --> 18:48.610
It was the president.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.980
No. No.

18:52.020 --> 18:54.920
No. Not again!

19:02.090 --> 19:05.200
Tomorrow, when we fight,
we carry with us

19:05.230 --> 19:07.500
the memory of the martyrs.

19:07.530 --> 19:09.270
Dirar Al Nami,

19:09.310 --> 19:13.690
Aya Qabbani,
Dunyah Al Nasri,

19:13.730 --> 19:15.330
Ghazi Hussein,

19:15.370 --> 19:18.700
Ru'a Al Zara...

19:20.400 --> 19:24.020
...Wajod Al Azmeh...

19:24.350 --> 19:26.520
...Majid Umran.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.350
I'll leave the two of you.

19:42.540 --> 19:45.210
(sighs)

19:47.730 --> 19:51.070
You don't need
to say anything.

19:51.100 --> 19:54.270
There's nothing to say.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.540
It won't get easier.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.840
Tomorrow could be much worse.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.910
I know.

20:03.950 --> 20:06.050
It's a war.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.220
People die.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.450
People you care about.

20:12.290 --> 20:14.260
Maybe me.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.330
Sammy, I want you to
go back to your mom.

20:21.230 --> 20:24.900
I'm fighting next to you.

20:27.170 --> 20:28.950
Sammy...

20:28.980 --> 20:31.840
I'm a part of this now.

20:31.870 --> 20:35.740
You know, it's one thing...

20:35.780 --> 20:38.080
to watch someone die.

20:38.110 --> 20:40.510
But to kill someone...

20:40.550 --> 20:42.920
Well, you're asking
other people,

20:42.950 --> 20:46.120
people my age,
to do that for you.

20:46.150 --> 20:48.990
Other people's children.

20:52.830 --> 20:54.990
I can't.

20:55.830 --> 20:57.130
I can't.

20:57.160 --> 21:01.070
I would feel the same way
if I were you.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.440
Anyone who loves someone
would feel the same way.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.380
But we're not special.

21:06.380 --> 21:07.700
We don't deserve more
from this world

21:07.700 --> 21:09.940
just 'cause we're Al Fayeeds.

21:09.980 --> 21:12.770
Hasn't that been
your point all along?

21:17.120 --> 21:19.290
(sighs)

21:23.460 --> 21:26.330
I'll have Siddiq
find you a weapon.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.030
What?

21:28.060 --> 21:30.630
You can't fight
without a weapon.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.070
Right.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.110
REPORTER:
<i>...unconfirmed reports</i>

21:35.150 --> 21:37.820
that the explosion happened
at 11:00 a.m. this morning...

21:37.960 --> 21:39.400
MOLLY: Hi. I was supposed
to meet someone in the lobby

21:39.430 --> 21:42.810
a little over an hour ago.
No one's asked to see me?

21:42.840 --> 21:45.090
Can't you check again, please?

21:45.130 --> 21:47.450
Yeah, I'll hold.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.860
...has made no official comment

21:53.890 --> 21:58.010
and has refused to confirm or
deny any reports of casualties.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.360
Sir, the signed
confession

22:01.400 --> 22:05.600
of the man that General Said
hired to plant the device

22:05.630 --> 22:08.200
that killed your mother.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.640
Apparently, General
Said invited you

22:14.670 --> 22:17.240
to visit the troops
that morning.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.580
His car was going
to follow yours

22:19.620 --> 22:21.210
to the Basri Air Force Base,

22:21.250 --> 22:24.910
but you begged off
at the last minute.

22:24.950 --> 22:28.050
Unfortunately,

22:28.090 --> 22:31.050
I remember that conversation.

22:31.090 --> 22:33.720
(sighs)

22:33.760 --> 22:36.130
Have you detained Solomon

22:36.160 --> 22:39.960
so I can learn
where his loyalties lie?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.330
He's waiting for you.

22:46.170 --> 22:48.100
It's very good.

22:48.140 --> 22:49.670
(Jamal chuckles)

22:49.710 --> 22:51.380
(clears throat)

22:51.410 --> 22:54.680
I have excellent chefs.

22:54.710 --> 22:58.180
And I cannot refuse a good meal.

22:58.220 --> 22:59.980
Um...

23:00.020 --> 23:03.140
you and I should have
an honest conversation

23:03.180 --> 23:06.220
about what happened
to General Said.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.890
You don't have to explain to me.

23:08.930 --> 23:12.130
I have no political
point of view.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.660
I work for money.

23:13.700 --> 23:16.300
And that's good.

23:16.330 --> 23:18.840
Since I'm the one
who's paying you.

23:18.870 --> 23:19.870
(clears throat)

23:19.900 --> 23:22.440
To show my good faith,

23:22.470 --> 23:25.660
I've decided
to increase your contract

23:25.700 --> 23:29.610
by... 19%.

23:29.640 --> 23:32.180
(laughs)

23:33.780 --> 23:35.920
19%, huh?

23:35.950 --> 23:36.570
Mm.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.100
(laughs)
That's good.

23:38.130 --> 23:40.690
You will take... orders

23:40.730 --> 23:43.260
directly from me

23:43.290 --> 23:46.750
as commander-in-chief.

23:46.780 --> 23:49.400
We'll launch
the counteroffensive

23:49.440 --> 23:51.800
tonight as planned.

23:53.330 --> 23:55.170
(sucks teeth)

23:55.200 --> 23:57.210
I'm greedy.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.030
But I'm not stupid.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.880
I will not send
my men into battle

24:01.910 --> 24:04.670
to take orders from a man
that does not know shit

24:04.700 --> 24:06.960
about military strategy.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.390
Don't play games with me.

24:12.420 --> 24:16.860
You have your
battle plans already.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.020
Plans change, Mr. President,

24:21.060 --> 24:23.510
once the bullets start flying.

24:26.970 --> 24:30.600
We were willing
to die for you...

24:30.640 --> 24:35.010
but I do not have a death wish.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.340
And I do not want to
work for an employer

24:37.380 --> 24:39.800
that is just as likely
to clap me in irons

24:39.840 --> 24:42.920
and throw me
in prison one day...

24:42.950 --> 24:44.920
as pay me the next.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.200
And I have

24:47.230 --> 24:50.420
three jobs in Africa
waiting for me.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.930
Thank you for the dinner.

24:53.960 --> 24:59.720
What if I increase your contract
by 50%, Solomon?

25:16.050 --> 25:18.750
It's your war.

25:18.790 --> 25:20.890
You fight it.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.930
Let me give you
some free advice.

25:27.960 --> 25:32.480
You've just imprisoned
an innocent man.

25:33.770 --> 25:36.530
No one is trying
to kill you, Mr. President,

25:36.570 --> 25:39.130
except the Caliphate.

25:44.320 --> 25:47.940
(door opens, closes)

25:56.410 --> 25:59.200
(Nusrat crying softly)

25:59.240 --> 26:01.870
(sniffles)

26:08.110 --> 26:11.820
It's been a terrible day.

26:11.850 --> 26:15.550
I just wonder
who you're crying for.

26:15.590 --> 26:18.420
What?

26:18.460 --> 26:19.200
Why would you...?

26:19.240 --> 26:21.590
Are you crying for him?

26:21.630 --> 26:22.390
I don't...

26:22.430 --> 26:24.430
I think you are.

26:24.460 --> 26:26.990
You're not crying
for my grandmother.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.700
I saw you together.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.900
This morning.

26:35.740 --> 26:37.370
He took your hand.

26:37.410 --> 26:40.480
He took my...?

26:45.950 --> 26:49.010
He was saying good-bye to me,
like a brother.

26:49.050 --> 26:50.890
Bullshit!

26:50.920 --> 26:54.390
I've seen the way he looks
at you, how you look at him.

26:54.430 --> 26:57.490
You told me you wanted
an annulment for my sake,

26:57.530 --> 26:59.800
so I could have an heir,
but that was a lie.

26:59.830 --> 27:01.610
- You just wanted to be with him.
- Ahmed...

27:01.640 --> 27:03.100
Tell me he doesn't want you!

27:03.130 --> 27:05.530
He wants everything.

27:05.570 --> 27:07.900
What I have,
what my father has.

27:07.940 --> 27:10.310
What all bastards want.

27:10.340 --> 27:14.130
You don't know
what you're talking about.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.650
I wanted you,

27:18.680 --> 27:21.500
but your parents
kicked me out.

27:21.530 --> 27:24.790
The annulment came from
them, Ahmed, not from me.

27:24.820 --> 27:26.820
I was just a messenger.

27:26.860 --> 27:29.520
Was Rami being
kind to me? Yes.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.330
The way that you're
kind to someone

27:31.360 --> 27:32.960
that's just
been discarded.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.040
He told me he would
look me up in London

27:35.070 --> 27:38.000
when he was done winning your
war for you, when he left here

27:38.040 --> 27:39.670
for the very last time.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.970
He wants nothing
from you!

27:42.000 --> 27:45.840
He was saving
your skin.

27:45.870 --> 27:49.080
And you... you
turned on him.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.730
I don't want to
hear any more.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.450
Well, I'm not done!

27:52.480 --> 27:55.210
Your parents are monsters,
Ahmed!

27:55.250 --> 27:57.550
Your family
is a horror!

27:57.590 --> 28:01.490
And I haven't even told you
the half of it.

28:06.990 --> 28:09.640
Knocking is always an option,
you know.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.270
You scared me
half to death,

28:12.300 --> 28:14.170
and I was very
nearly indecent.

28:14.210 --> 28:16.010
Very nearly?

28:16.050 --> 28:18.140
Why don't we go
with indecent?

28:18.170 --> 28:21.470
I'm sorry, Ahmed, I'm not
in the mood to be clever.

28:21.510 --> 28:25.480
Did you tell Nusrat she needed
to ask for an annulment?

28:25.510 --> 28:28.130
Ahmed, now is not the time.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.820
Answer me!

28:29.850 --> 28:31.760
Did Nusrat ask
for the annulment,

28:31.800 --> 28:34.120
or was it you and Father?

28:34.150 --> 28:37.220
It was understood that
an annulment was the only way...

28:37.260 --> 28:39.060
You're lying.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.000
Ahmed...

28:42.030 --> 28:43.830
You're lying.

28:43.860 --> 28:45.660
It was you.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.670
What does it matter?

28:49.700 --> 28:51.560
Why are we fighting?

28:54.570 --> 28:57.210
You need someone
to bear your child.

28:57.240 --> 29:00.050
What about Rami? What about
the charges against him?

29:00.090 --> 29:01.890
- I don't know.
- Are those lies, too?

29:01.930 --> 29:04.180
I don't know.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.550
Tell me what
really happened.

29:06.590 --> 29:07.820
I don't know.

29:07.850 --> 29:09.350
- Was it Father?
- (sighs)

29:09.390 --> 29:12.140
Was it a cover-up?
I can't figure it out.

29:12.170 --> 29:14.590
Was he trying to kill my brother
instead of the other way around?

29:14.620 --> 29:17.560
(whispers):
Oh, no, I can't believe...

29:17.600 --> 29:19.760
Oh, God.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.940
(sighs)

29:27.240 --> 29:29.740
Nusrat was right.

29:31.540 --> 29:34.080
You're both monsters.

29:34.110 --> 29:35.400
How dare you

29:35.430 --> 29:38.360
compare me to your
father! I love you.

29:39.510 --> 29:41.890
You're okay with destroying
everything around you.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.720
That's not true. I've tried.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.810
You tried? Really?

29:47.230 --> 29:49.570
- Not hard enough.
- I've tried,

29:49.600 --> 29:51.190
but everything dies
around your father.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.060
And you stood by his side!

29:53.100 --> 29:56.930
My entire life,
you stayed silent.

29:56.970 --> 29:58.840
You took the deal!

29:58.870 --> 30:01.390
You took his deal!

30:01.420 --> 30:03.470
(crying softly)

30:08.350 --> 30:12.780
Ahmed, please try to
understand my position.

30:12.820 --> 30:16.550
I have nothing that
matters except for a son.

30:18.820 --> 30:21.320
Except for you.

30:22.830 --> 30:25.300
That's why I never
left this place.

30:25.330 --> 30:27.700
Because of you.

30:27.730 --> 30:31.200
You treated me
like one of your puppets.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.440
Like one of your subjects.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.840
I never had a say
in my own life.

30:37.870 --> 30:41.500
You're an Al Fayeed.
I'm an Al Fayeed.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.080
None of us has a say
in our own lives.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.480
(sniffles)

30:46.520 --> 30:49.150
Did you even hear yourself?

30:50.020 --> 30:52.790
You and father can bring
the Palace down around you

30:52.830 --> 30:54.260
for all I care.

30:54.290 --> 30:56.110
I'm done with both of you.

30:56.150 --> 30:57.690
No, Ahmed, please.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.660
No. No, Ahmed, please.

30:59.690 --> 31:02.400
Please. No.
No. (crying)

31:11.980 --> 31:13.090
You need to eat more.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.280
How do you know?

31:14.320 --> 31:16.280
Have you ever done this before?
Gone into battle?

31:16.320 --> 31:20.300
M-Maybe it's better
not to be stuffed.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.690
Okay, then. I'll
pack your food.

31:23.720 --> 31:27.720
You don't know when you'll have
a chance for another meal.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.500
I'm too scared to eat.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.740
Like this.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.300
Now try again.

31:45.810 --> 31:47.910
- Zaher?
- Ah.

31:47.940 --> 31:48.800
How's your foot?

31:48.830 --> 31:52.980
Ah. Better since
you wrapped it.

31:53.010 --> 31:55.900
If you can't run on it,
I want you to stay behind.

31:55.930 --> 31:57.300
You'll get another
chance to fight.

31:57.330 --> 32:00.090
It's fine.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.890
I promise.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.000
I won't be a burden.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.270
You need to be
faster than this.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.300
I got it.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.460
If you're
nervous now,

32:15.500 --> 32:17.640
see what happens when
you're under fire, hmm?

32:17.670 --> 32:19.410
How's it going?

32:19.440 --> 32:20.970
I-I just need to practice
the reloading.

32:21.010 --> 32:22.440
He's nervous.
It's understandable.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.350
It's not nerves.
S-Something's wrong.

32:25.380 --> 32:26.880
I-I don't feel
like myself.

32:26.910 --> 32:27.960
You need sleep.

32:27.990 --> 32:29.720
I need to practice.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.420
So...

32:31.450 --> 32:34.720
After you get some sleep.

32:34.760 --> 32:35.820
Come on.

32:35.850 --> 32:37.960
I'll show you to your tent.

32:42.440 --> 32:44.580
See you in a few hours.

32:50.370 --> 32:51.930
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

32:51.960 --> 32:54.410
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.310
Oh.

32:59.350 --> 33:01.510
SAMMY: Got really tired
all of a sudden.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.750
- Yeah, it's been a long day.
- (sighs)

33:03.780 --> 33:05.420
- There we go.
- (sighs)

33:05.450 --> 33:07.450
Okay.

33:07.490 --> 33:09.120
Let's get
some sleep.

33:09.150 --> 33:11.760
Yeah.

33:11.790 --> 33:15.290
Here we go.

33:20.670 --> 33:23.370
I am so proud of you.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.970
You have no idea.

33:35.510 --> 33:36.800
He can't hear us.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.550
He'll be out for another
six hours at least.

33:39.580 --> 33:43.550
Well, he won't be very happy
when he wakes up.

33:43.590 --> 33:45.520
I'll do my best to tell him why

33:45.560 --> 33:47.290
you couldn't let him
come with you.

33:47.330 --> 33:51.030
I want him to hear it
from me when I get back.

33:51.060 --> 33:53.230
But if I don't
get the chance,

33:53.260 --> 33:56.100
I want you to
give him this.

33:56.130 --> 33:58.500
It's a...

33:58.540 --> 34:01.270
video I made trying
to explain myself.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.770
How soon do you head out?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.640
Very soon now. We have to
be in position before

34:06.680 --> 34:07.770
the sun comes up.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.679
Then we move in when
the sandstorm arrives.

34:10.710 --> 34:12.270
Right.

34:12.310 --> 34:15.110
How can I help? Um...

34:15.139 --> 34:18.139
You'll need provisions,
and, um, what else?

34:18.170 --> 34:21.120
Daliyah. Daliyah. Daliyah.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.530
What?

34:23.560 --> 34:26.030
You don't have
to say anything else.

34:26.060 --> 34:29.100
Everything is understood
between us.

34:29.130 --> 34:32.429
I will wait here for you
with your son.

34:34.270 --> 34:37.270
Come back, okay?

34:39.780 --> 34:42.389
But if you don't...

34:57.660 --> 34:59.660
Good-bye.

34:59.690 --> 35:01.740
That's all.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.100
We have nothing
to talk about.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.740
At least listen
to what I have to say.

35:10.780 --> 35:12.970
You can say
whatever you like.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.680
I'm a captive audience.

35:14.710 --> 35:18.610
I don't actually know the truth
about what happened today.

35:18.650 --> 35:22.760
But I've started to doubt
my husband's version of it.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.250
And I've started
to doubt his ability

35:27.290 --> 35:29.740
to carry on in his position.

35:30.930 --> 35:33.000
There's no one else here.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.810
Why don't you say
what you really mean?

35:37.830 --> 35:40.290
You're afraid.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.870
Of your husband.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.330
Of your husband's
enemies.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.570
You've watched
enough of the news

35:44.610 --> 35:48.180
over the past few years,
and it's suddenly dawned on you

35:48.210 --> 35:50.810
that you're
not special.

35:50.850 --> 35:52.810
You're not immune
from being washed away

35:52.850 --> 35:54.950
by the tides of history.

35:56.780 --> 35:59.350
If I were to switch sides,

35:59.390 --> 36:02.360
if I were to get you
out of here,

36:02.390 --> 36:04.260
would you support my son and I?

36:04.290 --> 36:05.690
Support?

36:05.730 --> 36:07.430
You mean...

36:07.460 --> 36:10.230
fight your war

36:10.260 --> 36:13.930
so that Ahmed can usurp
his father's presidency?

36:13.970 --> 36:16.170
I don't have those ducks
quite lined up yet,

36:16.200 --> 36:18.990
but, yes, essentially, yes.

36:19.060 --> 36:21.100
If I were to convince my son,
by doing this,

36:21.140 --> 36:23.580
that I've finally
come to my senses.

36:23.610 --> 36:26.430
It's an interesting game.

36:28.850 --> 36:31.340
- But you can't win it.
- Don't underestimate me.

36:31.380 --> 36:34.950
You can't beat Jamal.
He holds all the cards.

36:34.990 --> 36:37.990
Controls the government,
the secret police.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.630
- But you have the military.
- I have mercenaries.

36:40.660 --> 36:42.730
They have no interest
in a coup.

36:42.760 --> 36:46.180
They want to fight,
get paid and go home.

36:48.450 --> 36:51.480
What if I were to remove
my husband from the equation?

36:59.910 --> 37:01.630
You don't really mean that.

37:01.670 --> 37:02.980
No?

37:03.020 --> 37:05.150
What if I do?

37:05.180 --> 37:06.690
Really?

37:06.720 --> 37:09.990
You're shocked?

37:10.020 --> 37:13.060
Against the laws of nature,
is it?

37:14.890 --> 37:18.330
But how have the laws of nature
ever protected you?

37:18.360 --> 37:20.230
Or your family?

37:20.270 --> 37:22.910
Or our people?

37:23.980 --> 37:26.860
Since when did you become
a Boy Scout, Rami?

37:26.890 --> 37:30.050
I'm no better off in a world
in which sons kill fathers.

37:30.080 --> 37:33.790
And how about one
where fathers kill sons?!

37:34.280 --> 37:37.850
Or lead their country into ruin?

37:40.920 --> 37:44.350
People who are cornered
do desperate things.

37:44.390 --> 37:46.690
At this point,

37:46.730 --> 37:50.190
it might even be self-defense.

37:50.230 --> 37:52.400
So all I'm asking is:

37:52.430 --> 37:57.130
if I were to do my part,
will you do yours?

38:03.380 --> 38:05.460
(birds singing)

38:08.580 --> 38:10.170
State your business.

38:10.210 --> 38:12.220
I'm Molly Al Fayeed.

38:12.250 --> 38:15.120
I'm here to see
Amira Al Fayeed.

38:15.450 --> 38:17.990
Please, follow me.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.380
♪

39:04.530 --> 39:06.870
(steady thumping,
Jamal grunting)

39:17.750 --> 39:19.880
Mother.

39:25.350 --> 39:27.220
(sighs)

39:27.260 --> 39:31.950
If I could only
trade places with you.

39:33.860 --> 39:36.450
It should have been me.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.670
I know I don't deserve it.

39:42.710 --> 39:45.610
Will I see her again?

39:48.440 --> 39:50.610
(sighs)

39:54.660 --> 39:57.670
God, please...

39:57.710 --> 39:59.790
take me instead.

39:59.820 --> 40:04.330
Will I have a place in heaven
after all I've done?

40:04.360 --> 40:08.930
Please, just let me
see her again.

40:08.960 --> 40:11.730
Just once.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.970
(sobbing)

40:19.670 --> 40:21.310
(footsteps approaching)

40:24.480 --> 40:26.220
What is it, Nabila?

40:26.260 --> 40:27.310
Your sister-in-law...

40:27.350 --> 40:29.380
she's in the Palace
security office.

40:29.420 --> 40:31.330
Molly's here. Why?

40:31.360 --> 40:34.470
Something about an appointment
with Mrs. Al Fayeed.

40:36.460 --> 40:39.110
Oh, Amira.

40:40.490 --> 40:42.660
(Jamal continues sobbing)

40:55.550 --> 40:59.680
I came here to find Amira,
not to see you.

40:59.710 --> 41:01.480
I don't want to see you.

41:01.510 --> 41:02.980
This is my palace.

41:03.020 --> 41:05.790
Good for you.

41:05.820 --> 41:08.490
For this past year,
you haven't shown me

41:08.720 --> 41:11.460
or my children
one ounce of kindness,

41:11.490 --> 41:13.750
- one moment of mercy.
- That wasn't...

41:13.750 --> 41:15.620
Amira was supposed to meet me
yesterday morning,

41:15.660 --> 41:16.960
she hasn't been
returning my calls.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.350
So either let me see her
or kick me out,

41:19.380 --> 41:23.300
but please spare me
anything you have to say.

41:23.340 --> 41:26.080
I have no interest in you.

41:28.270 --> 41:29.840
Amira's dead.

41:29.880 --> 41:33.410
She was killed...

41:33.450 --> 41:35.450
in a car explosion

41:35.480 --> 41:39.090
that was meant for...

41:39.130 --> 41:41.450
I don't know who.

41:43.750 --> 41:45.840
Oh, my God.

41:51.680 --> 41:55.000
I saw the wrong brother killed.

41:55.030 --> 41:57.540
Jamal keeps
telling me

41:57.580 --> 42:01.660
that he's being punished
for killing Bassam, but...

42:04.040 --> 42:06.640
...I'm the one being punished.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.880
I'm the one losing everything.

42:12.050 --> 42:14.150
- I don't think...
- Leila.

42:14.180 --> 42:15.780
Yes?

42:15.820 --> 42:17.090
Yes, Molly?

42:17.120 --> 42:18.620
What's going on?

42:18.660 --> 42:22.850
I... I didn't...

42:25.130 --> 42:26.700
Leila!

42:26.730 --> 42:28.200
I didn't...

42:28.230 --> 42:31.000
What's going on?

42:36.740 --> 42:39.380
- Sammy. Stop.
- (muttering)

42:39.420 --> 42:41.640
There's no point.
They're hours gone by now.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.480
Damn!

42:43.510 --> 42:45.190
He had no right.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.950
That's not...
This wasn't about him and you.

42:47.990 --> 42:49.990
- Bullshit.
- This was about your mother.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.910
I-I don't know
what that means.

42:52.950 --> 42:55.590
It means that no one
should risk losing

42:55.620 --> 42:58.560
both a husband and a son
on the same day.

42:58.790 --> 43:02.200
Your father made the same rule
about other families as well.

43:02.230 --> 43:04.390
You're not the only one.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.200
Then why didn't he tell me?
Instead of...

43:08.240 --> 43:10.920
Because he knew
that you'd fight him on it.

43:10.950 --> 43:13.040
And because
he has soldiers to lead.

43:13.080 --> 43:16.490
And he could not spend the night
before this battle

43:16.520 --> 43:17.640
working through with you

43:17.680 --> 43:20.900
the mistakes that he made
in your childhood.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.220
He told you?

43:24.250 --> 43:27.520
Sammy, it's what
tortured him the most.

43:27.560 --> 43:31.220
When he thought that
he would never see you again.

43:36.430 --> 43:40.570
I think he's a different person
now than the one you knew.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.170
He loves you.

43:45.210 --> 43:48.440
He really loves you.

43:56.180 --> 43:58.820
Do you love him?

44:03.190 --> 44:05.260
(phone ringing)

44:13.470 --> 44:15.400
Hello.

44:15.440 --> 44:18.270
Sammy, I'm trying to get ahold
of your dad, he's not answering.

44:18.300 --> 44:21.270
He left his phone behind so the
Caliphate wouldn't track him.

44:21.310 --> 44:23.180
- Then he's left already?
- Yeah.

44:23.210 --> 44:25.380
God, there's got to be a way to
reach him. I need to reach him.

44:25.410 --> 44:27.950
Uh, what's going on?

44:27.980 --> 44:30.050
Sammy, listen to me.

44:30.080 --> 44:32.250
The military is not coming.

44:32.380 --> 44:35.000
Your father's on his own,
he's got no support.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.350
He needs to turn back.

44:36.390 --> 44:40.050
O-Okay, um, his soldiers
are in radio contact

44:40.080 --> 44:41.140
on a designated frequency.

44:41.170 --> 44:42.650
I will try to reach him
and get right back to you.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.370
Don't... don't worry.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.600
(wind roaring)

44:57.080 --> 44:59.410
(radio static crackling)

44:59.440 --> 45:01.200
HALIMA (through static):
This is base camp.

45:01.230 --> 45:02.740
Khalil, please respond
immediately.

45:02.770 --> 45:04.920
I repeat,

45:04.950 --> 45:06.160
this is base
camp, Khalil.

45:06.190 --> 45:07.770
Please respond
immediately.

45:07.810 --> 45:10.210
I repeat, please
respond immediately.

45:10.250 --> 45:11.860
(static crackling)

45:11.890 --> 45:16.710
I repeat, please
respond immediately.

45:16.740 --> 45:19.150
This is base camp, Khalil.
Please respond immediately.

45:19.180 --> 45:22.770
- I repeat, please respond immediately.
