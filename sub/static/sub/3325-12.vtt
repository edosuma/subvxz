00:02.044 --> 00:03.545
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:03.754 --> 00:05.164
The full moon is tomorrow night.

00:05.381 --> 00:07.588
It's a lunar eclipse. We'll all be powerless.

00:08.134 --> 00:09.670
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.425
This is a sacrifice.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.298
Jennifer. She's got all three now.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.384
Find the Nemeâ€™ron.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.307
You, Allison and
Stiles need to be sacrifices.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.259
It'll be a darkness around your heart.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.357
What does it mean?

01:57.201 --> 02:02.446
I don't know.
It's just something I traced with my fingers.

02:36.741 --> 02:37.947
God...

03:37.885 --> 03:39.170
We're seriously doing this?

03:39.762 --> 03:42.219
You're the one always bitching that
nothing ever happens in this town.

03:42.765 --> 03:45.256
I was trying to get a good night's
sleep before practice tomorrow.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.722
Stiles, wait up! Stiles!

03:53.651 --> 03:54.811
Hang on, hang on!

03:55.027 --> 03:57.564
- This little delinquent belongs to me.
- Dad, how are you doing?

03:57.780 --> 04:00.192
Well, young man,
I'm gonna walk you back to your car.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.621
Your father is a highly
respected private security consultant

04:16.841 --> 04:19.378
and a federally licensed firearms dealer.

04:19.677 --> 04:22.009
That's not exactly a nine-to-five office job.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.882
The hours are always going to be like this.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.555
| get it. It's just, it's kind of weird

04:26.767 --> 04:28.223
when he takes off in the middle of the night,

04:28.436 --> 04:30.973
rushing out with duffel bags
full of automatic weapons...

04:31.272 --> 04:32.557
Mom, look out!

04:38.821 --> 04:40.277
You almost killed him.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.155
- He ran out into the middle of the road.
- Okay, well, we have to go back.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.656
Go back?

04:45.119 --> 04:49.408
What if he's hurt? Mom, turn around.

04:50.541 --> 04:51.496
Mom!

04:59.967 --> 05:01.673
Allison. Allison!

05:08.309 --> 05:09.719
Allison!

05:26.702 --> 05:28.988
All right, that's enough. Back in the car.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.553
- What?
- I saw it. I know where it is.

06:37.773 --> 06:41.140
Yeah, we passed it. There was this stump.
This huge tree. Well, it's not huge anymore.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.521
It was cut down.
But it's still big, though. Very big.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.353
- It was the night we were looking for the body.
- Yeah, the same night you were bit by Peter.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.656
l was there, too, in the car with my mother.
We almost hit someone.

06:48.868 --> 06:51.234
It was me. You almost hit me.

06:52.872 --> 06:54.112
We can find it.

06:55.708 --> 06:56.697
What?

06:57.167 --> 06:58.873
You guys were out a long time.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.080
How long is a long time?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.086
Sixteen hours.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.214
We were in the water for 16 hours?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.339
And the full moon rises in less than four.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.060
You're okay.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.234
I'm doing much better
than you are right now.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.906
All because of you.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.234
Hopefully not all for nothing.

07:34.914 --> 07:36.870
The moon is rising, Derek.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.993
You drained your battery
all the way to the red

07:39.209 --> 07:41.541
and there is a fully charged
Alpha on her way to

07:41.754 --> 07:43.369
to rip you limb from limb.

07:43.756 --> 07:46.668
- I'll be fine in a few hours.
- I sincerely hope so,

07:46.884 --> 07:49.717
because a few hours is all that you have.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.257
No, dude. You are not going back with them.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.713
I made a deal with Deucalion.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.425
Does anyone else think that sounds
a lot like a deal with the devil?

07:57.603 --> 08:00.219
- Why does it matter anyway?
- Because I still don't think

08:02.733 --> 08:04.849
He trusts you more than anyone.
Tell him he's wrong.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.983
I'm not so sure he is.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.270
Circumstances like this sometimes require

08:09.490 --> 08:11.731
that you align yourself with
people you'd normally consider enemies.

08:11.951 --> 08:13.407
So we're gonna trust him,

08:13.619 --> 08:15.860
the guy that calls himself
"death, destroyer of worlds"?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.913
- We're gonna trust that guy?
- I wouldn't trust him, no.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.703
But you could use him to your advantage.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.707
Deucalion may be the enemy,
but he could also be the bait.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.180
I'm looking for Lydia.

08:39.770 --> 08:40.805
What do you want?

08:42.064 --> 08:43.395
I need your help.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.400
With what?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.058
Stopping my brother and Kali

08:50.698 --> 08:52.029
from killing Derek.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.454
Still working?

09:00.624 --> 09:02.330
But not for much longer.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.243
Anyone else feeling an
unbearable itch they can't scratch?

09:06.797 --> 09:09.880
Well, not before you said something,
but now, yes, I do.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.804
Is she actually gonna come down here
and slash all of our throats?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.215
Nah.

09:21.353 --> 09:22.559
She'll come down

09:22.771 --> 09:26.013
and strangle us with a garrote
and then slash our throats.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.820
It's just the wind.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.710
We know about the lunar eclipse,

09:49.131 --> 09:52.214
so don't think Kali's gonna sit around
waiting for it to level the playing field.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.544
She's coming.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.713
My brother's coming with her.

09:56.055 --> 09:57.966
Good enough for me. Derek?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.426
- You want me to run?
- No.

10:00.642 --> 10:04.351
I want you to stay and get slaughtered by an
Alpha with a psychotic foot fetish.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.973
Of course I want you to run!

10:06.315 --> 10:09.648
Sprint, gallop, leap your way
the hell out of this town.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.398
If you wanna fight and
die for something, that's fine with me.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.696
But do it for something meaningful.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.281
- How do you know I'm gonna lose?
- We don't.

10:18.494 --> 10:20.450
But I'll bet she has an idea.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.158
Don't you, Lydia?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.448
I don't know anything.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.458
But you feel something,

10:29.838 --> 10:30.998
don't you?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.663
What do you feel?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.499
| feel like

10:38.263 --> 10:40.003
I'm standing in a graveyard.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.642
Just grab anything.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.516
Stiles, I'm not smelling your dad's boxers.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.898
- Socks? Okay, I'll smell the socks.
- What about me?

10:52.528 --> 10:55.190
See what you can find in my dad's closet.
Anything with a strong scent.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.066
Quite an arsenal
your father's got here, young lady.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.913
Scott.

11:08.836 --> 11:09.916
What are you doing here?

11:10.129 --> 11:11.960
Following one of the only leads I have.

11:12.798 --> 11:16.040
Now, since I don't know where you've been,
why don't you have a seat? We can talk.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.553
You too, Isaac.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.046
How do you know my name?

11:22.516 --> 11:24.052
Your name is one of the few things I know.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.599
To be honest, the rest
of what's going on around here

11:26.770 --> 11:31.685
has me stumbling in the dark,
even over the smallest clue.

11:32.151 --> 11:33.982
If you're trying
to tell me that you don't have a clue,

11:34.194 --> 11:35.695
I learned that a long time ago.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.769
I'm really hoping
to avoid the embarrassment

11:37.990 --> 11:40.652
of dragging my own son
into an interrogation room.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.112
Really hoping.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.162
Where is he?

11:52.421 --> 11:54.833
I think he said
he was heading out to do some shopping,

11:55.174 --> 11:56.755
run a few errands.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.959
The usual werewolf afternoon.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.173
Who do you think you're talking to?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.799
Someone in desperate need of a pedicure.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.725
I'd be happy to give you a referral.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.441
Oh, really?

12:23.202 --> 12:25.318
Don't call until
you're at least 100 miles away.

12:27.956 --> 12:28.911
Go!

12:33.921 --> 12:34.876
I'm not gonna lie.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.376
I'm more than a little disturbed, not only by
the number of missing parents,

12:38.592 --> 12:42.505
but the fact that it's
Stiles' father, your father and your mother.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.297
Mine are both dead.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.975
Save the cliched teenage apathy for
your high school teachers.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.597
The three of you know more
than you're saying,

12:51.772 --> 12:54.889
and I'm fully willing
to keep you here all night if I have to.

12:59.905 --> 13:03.363
Did someone take their
little assignment too seriously?

13:04.868 --> 13:06.404
She's not the problem.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.987
Maybe the problem
is where your loyalties lie.

13:10.791 --> 13:14.534
Oh, God! Is this about to get really violent?

13:14.753 --> 13:15.868
Probably.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.802
So, who wants to go first?

14:29.786 --> 14:31.697
That's right, Kali. Look at me.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.618
Look at my face.

14:37.336 --> 14:40.828
Do you know what it takes
to be able to look like this?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.839
To be able to look normal?

14:46.511 --> 14:47.717
I don't care.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.594
It takes power.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.010
Power like this.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.378
I should've...

15:28.762 --> 15:31.378
I should've ripped your head off!

16:32.826 --> 16:36.694
What's the line Coach likes to say?
The bigger they are...

16:59.769 --> 17:01.225
You can't keep us here.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.136
Not without some kind of warrant.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.685
I've got a desk full of probable cause.

17:08.445 --> 17:11.278
My father is a highly
respected private security consultant

17:11.531 --> 17:13.738
and federally-licensed firearms dealer.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.532
That means he has to own a few weapons.

17:16.745 --> 17:21.079
Like this I75-pound draw tactical crossbow.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.415
Or this carbon steel Marine combat knife.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.122
Fifty AE Desert Eagle.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.714
Smoke grenade with pull-ring igniter.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.710
- Whoa!
- Go!

17:37.015 --> 17:38.926
Wait! Scott, wait!

17:47.776 --> 17:48.891
Come on!

18:11.758 --> 18:13.259
What do you want from me?

18:13.760 --> 18:16.092
I want you to do what you do best, Lydia.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.513
I want you to scream.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.440
What the hell was that?

18:35.657 --> 18:36.692
Lydia.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.369
We have to go back.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.709
- You okay?
- I didn't know what to say to him.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.667
I couldn't come up with anything.
But what you did, that was awesome.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.968
I still haven't
gotten anything from Stiles. You?

18:59.681 --> 19:01.046
I don't get it.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.723
All right.
Well, we can't wait for him. Come on.

19:20.952 --> 19:23.443
Cutting it a little close, aren't we, Scott?

19:25.248 --> 19:26.237
We got a little delayed.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.990
Where are the others?

19:28.168 --> 19:31.035
Occupying themselves with other pursuits.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.374
So it's just you and me against her?

19:33.590 --> 19:36.081
I think you'll be surprised
what a good team we make.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.469
Okay, get Stiles and then get
to the root cellar, okay?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.763
We'll keep Jennifer away long enough for
you to get them out of there.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.306
How are you gonna do that?

19:46.269 --> 19:47.645
l have a plan.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.898
You did this for me?

19:58.657 --> 20:01.524
For us.
For anyone who's ever been their victim.

20:01.743 --> 20:06.658
Stop talking to me like a politician. Stop
trying to convince me of your cause.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.706
Fine. I'II convince you of someone else's.

20:10.752 --> 20:11.707
Scott.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.962
You can save his mother, Stiles' father.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.209
How?

20:19.761 --> 20:21.001
I need a Guardian.

20:22.347 --> 20:25.931
That's a role that can either be filled by the
three parents I was forced to take,

20:27.268 --> 20:28.394
or by you.

20:29.437 --> 20:32.679
I can't help you.
I'm not even an Alpha anymore.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.768
All I need is for you
to help me get Deucalion

20:34.984 --> 20:36.815
in the right place at the right time.

20:37.028 --> 20:40.691
You just killed three of 'em on your own.
What do you need me for?

20:40.907 --> 20:44.024
You haven't seen him at his strongest.
lhave.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.860
And if he's got
Scott with him, I don't stand a chance.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.071
Unless I have you.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.535
Derek, don't trust her.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.537
l have the eclipse in my favor.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.540
But the moon's only gonna be in the Earth's
umbral shadow for 15 minutes.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.543
That's the extent of my window.
There's no decision to struggle with.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.546
Help me kill him and the others live.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.047
Just help me.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.555
Are you sure we're
going in the right direction?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.352
I know we're near it.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.893
- Do you think you can pick up a scent?
- I'm trying, but I can't...

21:19.320 --> 21:21.151
I hear something.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.698
It's an emitter. It's one of your dad's.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.947
- Are you sure?
- It has to be. Come on.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.360
Come on.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.717
Allison.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.407
Thank God!

22:13.374 --> 22:14.500
You found us.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.038
- Where's Stiles? Where's my son?
- And Scott?

22:18.254 --> 22:19.710
They're coming, all right?
They're on their way to help.

22:19.923 --> 22:20.912
Okay.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.552
We have to get going.
Lydia, we can get help.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.604
- From who?
- I don't know, but we can't stay here.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.954
They're alive.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.340
You said you had a plan?

23:06.553 --> 23:10.216
On the first day of class,
Jennifer sent all of us a message.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.723
It was the last line
from Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness."

23:14.769 --> 23:16.305
I got a message of my own to send her.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.355
You see this symbol?

23:29.993 --> 23:31.733
It's a symbol of revenge.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.911
You talk about balance,
about saving people.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.497
We know what you really want.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.167
And now you know where to find us.

23:51.389 --> 23:52.469
Hurry.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.600
Come on, let's get out of here.

24:09.365 --> 24:12.528
Cora, grab that table. Grab his head.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.609
- Hang on.
- Take his hand.

24:15.997 --> 24:19.239
- Can you save them?
- Only if they start healing on their own.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.525
What are you doing?

24:53.117 --> 24:56.951
This might be hard to
believe, but, actually, trying to help you.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.452
Ooh.

24:58.748 --> 25:01.034
Like brother against brother.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.411
How very American this is.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.711
Are you ready, Jennifer?

25:09.550 --> 25:12.883
Did you gather your herbs?

25:13.096 --> 25:16.930
Pray to your ancient gods
and your oak trees?

25:17.141 --> 25:20.133
Slit a baby's throat, perhaps?

25:20.812 --> 25:22.348
Should we show them

25:22.522 --> 25:29.189
why you needed to sacrifice
nine innocent people just to face me?

25:30.113 --> 25:32.570
Or is it 12 now?

25:45.753 --> 25:49.996
lt's blocked. What do you see? Anything?

25:54.679 --> 25:55.919
Look out!

25:58.433 --> 25:59.548
Isaac!

26:05.732 --> 26:07.347
Melissa! Go, go, go!

27:07.043 --> 27:08.533
Kill her.

27:10.338 --> 27:11.544
Do it.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.839
Now kill her.

27:24.769 --> 27:28.261
Your parents are dying.
That storm you hear?

27:28.481 --> 27:30.096
She's burying them alive.

27:30.733 --> 27:34.100
It's her connection to the telluric currents.
Kill her and it ends.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.978
It won't end. Not with me.

27:37.198 --> 27:40.440
He'll have you kill everyone you love.
It's what he does.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.150
They're dying, Scott.

27:42.370 --> 27:46.238
Your mother, and the parents
of your best friends.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.834
Kill her now and it's over.

27:50.253 --> 27:53.290
Become the Alpha you're meant to be.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.871
Become a killer.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.836
They're not dead yet.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.594
And who's going to save them?

28:01.764 --> 28:03.174
Your friends?

28:10.565 --> 28:11.805
My pack.

28:13.734 --> 28:16.146
Is it me, or is this place getting smaller?

28:34.422 --> 28:38.461
Maybe you just need a little guidance.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.548
| forgot to tell you something,

28:44.348 --> 28:46.725
something that Gerard told me.

28:47.768 --> 28:51.511
"Deucalion isn't always blind."

29:16.964 --> 29:20.832
The eclipse. It's started.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.597
Oh, no.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.688
I can't do it. I can't hold it! I can't hold it!

29:41.197 --> 29:42.687
It's too much! It's too heavy!

29:51.457 --> 29:53.698
| always said aluminum
was better than wood.

30:37.378 --> 30:38.333
JennHeL

30:41.257 --> 30:42.497
He doesn't know.

30:42.967 --> 30:44.252
Know what?

30:45.177 --> 30:46.587
What you really look like.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.091
He knows the cost
of bringing Kali into his pack.

30:53.311 --> 30:55.597
But he's never seen the price you paid.

31:00.735 --> 31:04.102
No. No, he hasn't.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.721
Turn to me.

31:34.769 --> 31:35.929
Turn to me!

31:52.995 --> 31:54.155
What is this?

31:54.413 --> 31:57.200
Healing him made you weak,
just like healing Cora did to me.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.786
You won't have your strength
for at least a few minutes.

32:00.169 --> 32:01.375
Then you do it.

32:02.755 --> 32:03.835
Kill him.

32:05.758 --> 32:06.713
No.

32:08.761 --> 32:09.716
What?

32:10.054 --> 32:13.012
Like my mother used to say, I'm a predator,

32:14.767 --> 32:16.473
but I don't have to be a killer.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.345
Let them go.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.661
Derek.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.514
Your 15 minutes are up.

33:53.324 --> 33:56.816
Like I told you, Derek,
either you or the parents.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.697
Well, I guess I'll just have to take them now.

34:00.164 --> 34:02.155
In a few minutes they'll be dead

34:02.374 --> 34:05.502
and I won't need a
lunar eclipse even to kill a Demon Wolf.

34:18.349 --> 34:19.930
You've tried this before, Scott.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.722
I don't remember you having much success.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.455
How did you do that?

35:34.758 --> 35:36.464
I'm an Alpha now.

35:40.639 --> 35:46.009
Whatever you're doing to cause the storm,
make it stop, or I'll kill you myself.

35:47.605 --> 35:49.345
I don't care what it does
to the color of my eyes.

35:51.609 --> 35:54.976
It won't change the
color of mine, so allow me.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.211
Is it over?

36:24.141 --> 36:25.426
I knew.

36:26.143 --> 36:27.132
What?

36:28.646 --> 36:29.681
I knew you liked me.

36:35.569 --> 36:36.558
Scott?

36:36.779 --> 36:38.735
Hey. You okay?

36:39.156 --> 36:41.693
Yeah, we're okay. We're all okay.

36:42.159 --> 36:43.444
How 'bout you? Are you okay?

36:45.537 --> 36:46.526
Sort of.

36:46.747 --> 36:48.112
Well, you think you can come get us?

36:48.332 --> 36:49.287
Yeah, of course.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.956
Great. Okay, um,

36:52.002 --> 36:53.378
bring a ladder.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.627
My mother told me
you were a man of vision once.

37:00.427 --> 37:04.011
We're letting you go because
we hope you can be that man again.

37:04.932 --> 37:08.720
But if you're not, then having your
eyesight back won't matter.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.681
Because you'll never see us coming.

37:22.491 --> 37:23.731
Back to storage?

37:25.327 --> 37:26.407
That's the plan.

37:27.371 --> 37:29.578
What if I've got a different plan?

37:30.833 --> 37:33.165
Deaton said that
what we did in order to find you,

37:33.377 --> 37:35.333
he said that it might draw things here.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.916
Make Beacon Hills kind of a beacon again.

37:41.301 --> 37:42.290
I hope not.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.636
l was thinking
that maybe I should be prepared,

37:46.849 --> 37:50.808
learn to be a better fighter and learn all the
things that you can still teach me.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.520
And maybe a few things more.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.100
But we're going to have a new code.

38:02.364 --> 38:06.528
"We protect those
who cannot protect themselves."

38:15.919 --> 38:18.786
I honestly don't know
if he's ever coming back.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.500
Part of me hopes so,

38:21.759 --> 38:24.876
but another part hopes
that maybe he'll be okay

38:25.179 --> 38:26.464
somewhere else.

38:30.309 --> 38:33.221
My dad doesn't look like
he's gonna be leaving for a while.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.353
But just because he's staying

38:41.111 --> 38:42.942
doesn't mean he's welcome.

38:46.658 --> 38:51.698
Stiles and I both feel it every day.
Just like you said we would.

38:52.998 --> 38:56.832
And it makes me think about that quote
Jennifer used to start our first class.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.747
Because when I feel it,

38:59.963 --> 39:04.832
it's like I'm looking
"into the heart of an immense darkness."

39:07.137 --> 39:08.718
So what do you do instead?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.255
I look for my friends.

39:53.684 --> 39:55.345
And what about Ms. Blake?

39:55.561 --> 39:56.676
I don't know.

39:58.605 --> 40:02.439
When we went back inside
the distillery, her body was gone.

40:08.949 --> 40:11.156
Oh, please! Please!

40:12.911 --> 40:15.072
You saved me once before...

40:32.639 --> 40:34.630
Of course it's you.

40:38.061 --> 40:43.681
Everyone else suffers,
but somehow you come out on top.

40:44.526 --> 40:48.769
And now that Scott's an Alpha,
you'll be able to steal it from him.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.447
You'll be an Alpha again.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.779
Again?

40:57.831 --> 40:59.116
Again?

41:04.671 --> 41:08.630
I am the Alpha!

41:09.760 --> 41:14.470
I've always been the Alpha!
