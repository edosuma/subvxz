02:16.678 --> 02:18.555
...kidding, right?

02:18.638 --> 02:21.933
- It's speculation. Nothing more.
- It's sexual assault!

02:22.016 --> 02:24.185
Even if it is,
and I am not saying it isn't,

02:25.645 --> 02:27.188
there's no proof.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.607
It's not involuntary
intoxication.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.570
These women admit in these texts
that they willingly drank.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.697
Imperfect consent,
such as it is,

02:35.780 --> 02:37.073
is not a criminal act.

02:37.156 --> 02:40.243
Not criminal? So what,
it's just a misunderstanding?

02:40.326 --> 02:41.578
What would make it
a criminal act?

02:41.661 --> 02:42.996
If it crossed the line

02:43.079 --> 02:46.040
from intoxication
to incapacitation.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.293
Do you know if any of
these women were unconscious--

02:48.376 --> 02:50.253
The texts literally say
that they don't remember.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.964
So, if they can't remember
consenting, then...

02:53.047 --> 02:54.465
how can anybody say
that they did?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.050
Who is to say they didn't?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.428
The fact is, while these
morning-after texts

02:58.511 --> 02:59.971
offer a reason to believe

03:00.054 --> 03:02.140
your father may have
taken advantage

03:02.223 --> 03:04.350
of multiple women years ago,

03:04.434 --> 03:05.852
only one of them
has come forward

03:05.935 --> 03:06.895
claiming as such.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.813
One, as it turns out,
who lied about that claim.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.816
To protect
a higher-profile victim.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.027
Potential victim.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.820
And none of these other women
have come forward.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.071
Not even...

03:17.155 --> 03:20.617
this alleged higher-profile
potential victim.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.745
You want my advice?

03:23.828 --> 03:25.455
That's why
we're here, Nance.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.790
We wanna know the best course
of action for Julien.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.753
You wait, you do nothing,
and you make sure that this

03:31.836 --> 03:33.296
doesn't fall into
the wrong hands.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.797
Shouldn't she try to get
ahead of it?

03:34.881 --> 03:36.382
You know, tell somebody
what she knows?

03:36.466 --> 03:37.967
Nobody even knows
about these other women.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.512
And it's not your place
to tell. It's theirs.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.681
And until these other
women come forward,

03:43.765 --> 03:44.974
there is nothing you can do.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.726
I could post a statement!

03:46.809 --> 03:48.686
Anything that you say
in a public forum

03:48.770 --> 03:51.564
will be turned around on you.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.150
Okay? I highly suggest
radio silence.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.319
Just watch it play out

03:56.402 --> 03:57.111
and don't put yourself
in the middle of it.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.740
Aren't I already
in the middle of it?

04:01.908 --> 04:05.954
I know this is a lot,
but it's for your ultimate good.

04:06.037 --> 04:09.540
Trust the process.
- No statements. No posts.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.084
Not online. Not in person.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.878
But I have to go to school!
I have classes! I have a test!

04:13.962 --> 04:16.506
This is a crisis.
The school will understand.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.674
Listen, though...

04:17.757 --> 04:20.093
I know that it doesn't
feel like it right now,

04:20.635 --> 04:21.511
justice is moving.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.389
And if what you believe
happened to those women

04:24.472 --> 04:25.390
did happen to those women,

04:25.473 --> 04:28.309
they are watching this all
play out right now.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.313
And just because they've
yet to come forward

04:32.397 --> 04:33.731
doesn't mean they won't.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.274
It just takes time.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.368
Karma's that bitch?
Really, Scott?

04:45.451 --> 04:48.037
What makes you think that little
piece of poetic justice was me?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.497
There's a sports metaphor.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.665
I did a little rewrite.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.167
The crew's so blah and academic.
It needed a zhuzh.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.045
So I repurposed an old post
from the aughts.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.422
I thought you'd like
the initiative.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.840
You thought an English teacher
would like plagiarism?

04:58.923 --> 05:01.467
I changed some words!

05:01.551 --> 05:03.261
The part about the Waldorf
person wouldn't make sense.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.722
I turned the comments back on,
by the way.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.889
Part of what makes
America great

05:06.973 --> 05:08.433
is that we all have a voice
to troll each other with.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.520
Did you run all the way here?

05:12.603 --> 05:16.232
No, I spent my paycheck
on an Uber so I could witness

05:16.315 --> 05:18.735
first-hand you taking
a sledgehammer to the thing

05:18.818 --> 05:21.237
I care most deeply about.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.199
I know what you care about...
and it isn't this.

05:26.492 --> 05:30.121
What? Oh, ew! Scott, no!

05:30.204 --> 05:31.247
You still want a piece.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.334
Now that I'm back in your orbit,
I'm on your mind.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.587
Even after I ghosted you.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.548
I ghosted you!

05:40.631 --> 05:43.259
- Hmm...
- And I care about Gossip Girl.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.763
I know I got voted off
the island, okay? I get it.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.514
I got too close,
I have opinions,

05:48.598 --> 05:51.267
but what you posted this morning
about an influencer

05:51.350 --> 05:54.395
possibly being complicit
in her dad's illicit issues

05:54.479 --> 05:56.522
was wrong and dangerous.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.483
You could ruin a kid's life.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.109
So what? She'll buy a new one.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.945
- Wow!
- You know what your problem is?

06:03.029 --> 06:05.615
That I'm an actual human being
and not a sentient jockstrap?

06:05.698 --> 06:06.783
That you're here
trying to convince yourself

06:06.866 --> 06:09.410
you're anything more than
six degrees of Perez Hilton.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.287
You don't care about these kids
any more than I do!

06:11.954 --> 06:14.165
You just love the rush.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.585
I know it, and you know it.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.298
We're making gossip
great again, Keller.

06:22.381 --> 06:25.093
And you are benched
for the season.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.970
Now if you don't mind,

06:28.054 --> 06:30.139
I have to hose my balls off
before sex ed.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.732
Sorry!

06:46.197 --> 06:47.365
Oh. Morning.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.952
Uh, I thought you said
no one was home.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.538
You needed me
to hand off Michael Caine

06:53.621 --> 06:55.123
to the private plane people.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.544
No... that happened last week.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.797
<i>Bri-ssant?</i>
- They're brioche croissants.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.923
Sure.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.468
Oof. Aw, this is nice, right?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.720
Three-top back together again?

07:09.804 --> 07:13.182
Honey, we know what
you're doing.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.183
I don't know what you mean.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.812
Well, first, it was Rocky's
surprise party...

07:17.895 --> 07:19.772
Okay, so I was off
by a few months.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.192
And the false alarm of Pops
throwing his back out

07:23.276 --> 07:26.028
- during an installation?
- No, no. No, I simply misheard.

07:26.112 --> 07:30.241
Lilac and sacroiliac,

07:30.324 --> 07:32.201
they're-- I mean, they're--
they're practically homonyms.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.995
Look, Max,

07:34.078 --> 07:35.204
we know the separation's
been tough on you.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.540
It's been hard on all of us.

07:37.623 --> 07:41.043
The point is, Max, it's got to
stop. You can't force it.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.004
These things, they take time.

07:43.087 --> 07:47.091
And your dad and I, we're just--
we're on different paths now.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.725
Well,
I'd better get to work.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.728
- I, uh, can't be late.
- You're literally your own boss.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.396
Yeah,
and I am an absolute tyrant.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.942
I get you're disappointed,

08:05.860 --> 08:07.403
but please understand

08:07.486 --> 08:10.364
that your dad and I agree
on one thing...

08:10.448 --> 08:15.161
always and forever,
our love for you.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.662
True.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.831
I'll see you soon.

08:21.584 --> 08:21.667
Ooh, here.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.840
Take these extra to Julien. Ay!

08:27.924 --> 08:31.552
You know, all that trauma...
The girl needs to eat.

08:41.062 --> 08:41.437
What are you doing here?

08:43.606 --> 08:44.524
How did you find us?

08:46.692 --> 08:46.984
I just wanna talk.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.028
Jules, let's go.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.863
It's all right, Z.
They have to speak.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.576
Okay, we'll be in the lobby.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.514
Aki Menzies, Road Rash King
of the Upper East Side.

09:16.597 --> 09:19.934
Rex Huntington,
Queen of doubles tennis!

09:20.017 --> 09:21.227
Oh, you noticed.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.645
What's up?

09:22.728 --> 09:24.605
I just wanted to say welcome
to the club.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.191
I know coming out can be rough,
and with your dad,

09:27.275 --> 09:29.360
I can't even imagine.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.153
Yeah, it's, uh...
it's been a journey.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.656
Now that you've arrived,

09:33.739 --> 09:35.825
a question I've always
wanted to ask...

09:35.908 --> 09:39.036
What kind of risky skateboard
trick makes you get a scar...

09:39.120 --> 09:41.580
right here?

09:41.664 --> 09:44.750
I got my arm stuck in a pool
table when I was five.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.752
I wish I could credit it to
something gnarlier, but--

09:46.836 --> 09:50.715
Okay. I'm not actually
talking about scars. Obvi.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.511
- You just were.
- Wow.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.638
You really don't get it?
I'm trying to ask you out.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.017
I'm not single.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.687
Your straight side might not be,
but your gay side very much is.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.731
It doesn't work like that.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.317
Dude, you're queer now.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.651
It works
however you want it to...

10:11.902 --> 10:15.573
which is why I'm gonna
give you my number

10:15.656 --> 10:18.784
in case you're up for it,
whatever "it" may be.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.246
And yes, I'd totally do that
on the first date.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.583
- Rex!
- Okay, okay.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.377
If it seems like I'm being
a bit aggressive, it's...

10:29.211 --> 10:29.962
it's because I like you.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.922
- Always have.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.760
And that doesn't have to mean
anything more than that.

10:35.843 --> 10:41.349
If you ever need a...
a queer ear or... a gay friend,

10:41.432 --> 10:45.227
an old-fashioned date, and or
the best head of your life,

10:45.311 --> 10:46.562
you know where to find me.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.861
She didn't post it.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.906
- Post what?
- My parents' tax returns.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.575
I'm pretty sure Gossip Girl
has other things on her mind.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.619
Like what?
Like non-stop trolling Julien?

11:01.702 --> 11:05.289
- Did you talk to her?
- Who talks to Gossip Girl?

11:05.373 --> 11:05.581
No, Julien!

11:08.334 --> 11:09.752
No, I didn't. I, uh--

11:09.835 --> 11:11.379
She does not want
to hear from me.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.963
Your girlfriend made that
very clear.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.007
Do you think Gossip Girl's,
like, holding it back

11:15.091 --> 11:17.218
and waiting for all this
Davis shit to blow over?

11:17.301 --> 11:19.136
"Davis shit"? I know
you care about her,

11:19.220 --> 11:21.013
but the way you're talking,
it doesn't seem--

11:21.097 --> 11:23.641
No. Look. I care about her
too much, Ak.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.726
And I-- I need something
to distract myself,

11:25.810 --> 11:27.311
like my parents,
otherwise I'll dissolve

11:27.395 --> 11:28.437
into a million Thanos specks

11:28.521 --> 11:31.440
- and disappear forever.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.651
Well, I hate to admit it,
but Gossip Girl is pretty smart

11:33.734 --> 11:35.444
for leaning into
this Davis stuff.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.571
It's fucked,
but everyone's talking about it.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.782
- Yeah.
- A lot more than
they would tax evasion.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.451
Hey, it's been days
and no posts.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.204
- Has anyone heard from JC?
- Zero intel.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.956
Audrey said they
crashed at Zoya's.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.291
What? Really? Wait!
Wh-- Wh-- What else did she say?

11:49.375 --> 11:50.751
You can ask her yourself.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.963
Hi. Hello. Hello. Hello.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.756
Okay. So Julien is fine.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.300
She appreciates everyone
reaching out, but...

11:58.384 --> 11:59.760
she just needs a minute
right now.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.805
- A minute to do what?
- Absolutely nothing.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.224
Okay? Her lawyer said
she needs to cut it out.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.809
No posts, no-- no interviews,

12:06.892 --> 12:08.477
and not even school
right now, so...

12:08.561 --> 12:09.603
If she stays silent
too much longer,

12:09.687 --> 12:12.398
people are going
to actually believe

12:12.481 --> 12:15.317
- that she's been in
on this daddy drama.
- They already think that.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.652
The head of the Pacific
Northwest Chapter

12:16.735 --> 12:18.362
of the Jul-lions
called her a "hags-been"

12:18.446 --> 12:20.990
and dropped off
our hold-down-the-fort
Houseparty this morning.

12:21.073 --> 12:21.740
You know that's
not reality, right?

12:23.742 --> 12:25.327
This is reality.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.455
And what Julien needs right now
is her support system,

12:27.538 --> 12:29.373
not spin doctors.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.792
Consider her off-grid
until further notice.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.510
Is there... anything I can do?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.762
I'm sorry.
I've been rude to you lately.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.847
But honestly, Obie,

12:44.930 --> 12:46.974
if she needs you, she's gonna
reach out. I promise.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.977
Fine. Peace, bro.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.441
Hi.
- Missed you last night.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.567
Missed you too.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.946
- Who were you texting?
- Oh. Uh...

13:01.030 --> 13:04.867
Just that kid Rex,
the senior with the freckles.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.035
I am well aware
of Rex Huntington.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.663
Yeah, he just put his number
in my phone this morning.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.790
- No big deal, right?
- You think he's hot?

13:11.874 --> 13:13.334
He sends one eggplant emoji,
and...

13:13.417 --> 13:15.377
suddenly I'm obsessed with him?

13:15.461 --> 13:16.754
Well, he also said, um...

13:17.922 --> 13:22.801
Wow! Okay, I did not realize
you could even do that!

13:22.885 --> 13:24.345
So, what?
Do you wanna hook up with him?

13:24.428 --> 13:26.805
No! No, of course not! I--

13:26.889 --> 13:29.099
Well, maybe if things
were different, but--

13:29.183 --> 13:31.894
No, actually, no. I love you,
and I'm with you.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.022
No one said anything
about love, babe. Okay?

13:35.105 --> 13:38.150
I'm a girl who is dating a guy
who also likes guys.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.861
So, as a guy who likes guys,
Rex Huntington, hot or not?

13:41.946 --> 13:42.863
Uh...

13:42.947 --> 13:44.573
Hmm?
- Hot. Okay. Very hot.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.742
Uh... I've thought about him
once or twice when I...

13:46.825 --> 13:49.954
Okay, thank you.
See? We can do this.

13:50.037 --> 13:54.333
- What are you doing?
- Figuring it out. Together.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.585
- Figuring what out?
- Our modern relationship.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.129
Ah! You need a third?
I'm right here.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.758
Thank you, but like I said
before, we're done with that.

14:02.841 --> 14:03.884
- Again, I'm right here.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.223
Oh, Rex? Oh, okay!
Hope you like to watch, Hope.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.141
Not really up for what you have.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.102
Well, it's not for me.
It's for Aki.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.937
We're trying something new
with someone new.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.107
Why do you smell like butter?

14:18.190 --> 14:22.486
Dad. He demanded
that I ply JC full of carbs.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.280
Oh, well,
she's not coming in, so...

14:24.363 --> 14:25.781
Do you want one?

14:25.864 --> 14:28.951
Um...
Uh...

14:38.794 --> 14:41.839
Uh... Well, if the whole
Rex thing doesn't pan out...

14:41.922 --> 14:44.550
He will, but thanks
for the repeated offer.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.343
And thanks for whatever that is.

14:53.934 --> 14:57.688
- If you're not gonna say any--
- I didn't do it. I didn't.

14:57.771 --> 14:58.647
- But that night, you--
- I was so freaked out

14:58.731 --> 15:01.108
I might lose everything, I...

15:03.569 --> 15:05.321
I don't even remember
what I said.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.656
So you thought coming here
this morning

15:07.740 --> 15:09.617
and saying "I didn't do it"
was the way to go?

15:09.700 --> 15:10.868
What you don't understand,
Jules, is when I say

15:10.951 --> 15:13.662
I didn't do it, I'm saying
I didn't do it on purpose.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.374
So, I'm not saying
those women are lying.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.711
If they feel I took advantage
of them, that means I did.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.672
But I didn't mean to. I did--
I didn't think I was.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.050
- That doesn't make it okay.
- I don't wanna make it okay.

15:27.509 --> 15:30.429
I will take part
in any investigation
that needs to happen

15:30.512 --> 15:31.930
if someone comes forward.
No one has.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.476
So maybe, just maybe...

15:36.935 --> 15:41.315
what if those texts weren't sent
in fear or as accusation?

15:43.275 --> 15:45.611
What if those women didn't feel
taken advantage of?

15:45.694 --> 15:46.945
Is that possible too?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.201
But Riley...

15:52.284 --> 15:56.830
I'm here and ready to listen
when she's ready to talk.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.876
I just hope that you'll be
by my side as I do it.

16:03.253 --> 16:05.005
I don't mind losing
everything if I deserve it,

16:05.089 --> 16:06.382
but I can't lose you.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.887
- Do something!
- I can't.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.515
This is between them.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.368
- Nice to meet you, Max.
- Hmm.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.085
Who the fuck is that?

21:35.168 --> 21:35.836
You know exactly
who that is, Max.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.380
Luckily, I don't.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.799
Because in this city,
in that demographic,

21:40.882 --> 21:43.301
there's a 70 percent chance
that I could have,

21:43.385 --> 21:45.721
and then how would
you have felt about that?

21:45.804 --> 21:47.514
Raul is a friend. Nothing more.

21:47.597 --> 21:50.183
For now. So, is this
what being on a different path

21:50.267 --> 21:51.893
than Pops means?

21:51.977 --> 21:53.729
Does he know
you're on this path?

21:53.812 --> 21:56.106
Do-- Do you think
that you should be on this path?

21:57.357 --> 22:01.236
You know that your dad and I
are presently not together.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.738
Yes, but I did not think
that it would be you pursuing

22:02.821 --> 22:05.407
a new future, either!

22:05.490 --> 22:08.160
He and I have agreed
to see other people.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.787
You've not even given Pops
a chance to make things right.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.123
No, honey. No. This isn't
something to make right.

22:14.666 --> 22:18.086
Some people stay
their whole lives together

22:18.170 --> 22:21.256
in that uncomfortable place,
and...

22:21.339 --> 22:24.676
your dad and I, we are not going
to do that to one another.

22:28.805 --> 22:29.806
I see that.

22:31.933 --> 22:34.770
You don't have to leave.
Uh... Raul and I can go.

22:34.853 --> 22:38.440
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't worry. The house is yours.

22:52.579 --> 22:56.375
<i>Hey, there.</i>

22:56.458 --> 22:57.417
Did you know
that Dad's seeing someone?

23:00.670 --> 23:03.799
He's allowed to do
whatever he wants, Max.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.051
I only asked
that I not be told about it.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.302
And now I have been.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.513
Pops, I'm really fucking this
all up.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.014
It was already fucked up, son.

23:12.265 --> 23:13.475
This limbo's killing me.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.144
Hey, uh...

23:16.228 --> 23:17.437
Wanna come with me
on a job right now?

23:27.072 --> 23:28.740
What are you doing?

23:28.824 --> 23:30.117
I didn't wanna disturb you.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.619
I was just looking for the old
phone to give to the lawyers.

23:32.702 --> 23:35.288
- To give to them, or...
- Or what?

23:35.372 --> 23:37.040
Or delete what's on it?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.000
You think this proves
I'm guilty?

23:39.084 --> 23:40.168
This proves I'm innocent.
My lawyers need it

23:40.252 --> 23:42.504
to show that I was dating
those women,

23:42.587 --> 23:44.589
not targeting them.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.341
- You still don't believe me.
- You're just trying

23:46.424 --> 23:48.385
to get in my head
and manipulate what I think!

23:48.468 --> 23:50.762
That is not
what I'm trying to do at all.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.305
Do you have any idea
what could happen

23:52.389 --> 23:53.390
if this phone
fell into the wrong hands?

23:53.473 --> 23:56.101
If you're innocent,
why would that scare you?

23:57.144 --> 23:59.146
If everything you said
is true, it wouldn't.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.192
Keep it.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.494
Hey. How you doing?

24:15.996 --> 24:17.289
Just...

24:17.372 --> 24:18.999
I wanna call her, but...

24:19.082 --> 24:20.834
I just wanna give her her space.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.711
But I really wanna call her.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.254
I just wanna make sure
she's okay.

24:24.754 --> 24:25.755
I know you do.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.091
But she'll call if she's not.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.887
The gray areas in life?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.348
I wish I could say
they get easier to navigate

24:35.432 --> 24:35.599
as you get older...

24:37.434 --> 24:41.062
but you kinda just
get used to them.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.064
Why do you allow yourself
to get used to them?

24:43.148 --> 24:44.608
Because when things get
complicated,

24:44.691 --> 24:45.859
sometimes they stay that way.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.527
No. Things get complicated

24:47.611 --> 24:50.363
when people aren't
honest with each other.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.282
And those gray areas
are just a great place to hide.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.409
The kind of people
that hide in them

24:54.492 --> 24:56.494
are those who feel they are
guilty about something.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.717
Hey! Are you okay?

25:11.468 --> 25:13.220
Yeah.

25:13.303 --> 25:15.972
<i>I can't just wait around
for these women to come forward.</i>

25:16.056 --> 25:17.807
<i>I need to know the truth.</i>

25:17.891 --> 25:19.017
I think I need your help.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.574
Oh, man,
I can't wait to get fucked up,

25:34.658 --> 25:36.326
man...

25:37.118 --> 25:38.370
Hey!

25:40.121 --> 25:41.581
Why so serious?

25:41.665 --> 25:43.375
It's SantaCon!
Best day of the year!

25:43.458 --> 25:46.920
Hey, do me a favor. Smile!

25:49.172 --> 25:50.507
Bitch!

25:54.094 --> 25:55.553
Hey! Are you sure about this?

25:55.637 --> 25:59.307
Best case, I find out what
my dad believes is true.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.977
Worst case,
what we fear is true.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.687
That lawyer said there's nothing
anyone can do

26:03.770 --> 26:05.522
unless one of the other women
comes forward,

26:05.605 --> 26:07.190
but why would they?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.942
They don't even know
each other exists.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.735
I just need one
to tell me her truth.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.070
And then the others will follow.

26:12.153 --> 26:14.030
So I texted them.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.199
So far, only one's gotten
back to me.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.994
Carmen Gruben,
head of Music, Inc.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.996
She agreed to meet,
but I don't wanna go alone.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.080
You don't have to. I'm here.

26:22.163 --> 26:24.165
We have to get past them.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.713
I found a driver
we can trust.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.680
Don't worry. This isn't weird
at all for me either.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.390
All right, we gotta tuck down
in the back.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.731
Hi.

26:48.940 --> 26:49.983
Hi.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.821
- All right. Hold on.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.203
Hey, I think
that's Obie!

27:03.496 --> 27:05.373
Yeah, it is.
You have to send it in.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.303
What do you think?
Is that him?

27:18.386 --> 27:19.554
Sharon says yes.
Tati's not sure.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.640
Thanks for meeting me.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.895
No worries, bro.
Everything cool?

27:26.978 --> 27:29.272
Ah! It's stupid,
but, you know Kate.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.608
I mean, I know you know Kate.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.902
We all do.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.113
You hit that too? Huh.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.323
No, I didn't.

27:38.406 --> 27:41.159
But I mean, I could, maybe.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.328
Wow. That was gross.
Forget I said that.

27:43.411 --> 27:46.414
Anyway, um, I've been thinking.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.917
I'm glad Kate's not involved,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.878
because she was
taking things too far.

27:51.961 --> 27:54.255
And I'm on your side, obviously.

27:54.339 --> 27:59.427
Uh... But I had one tiny,
very tiny, critique. If I may?

27:59.511 --> 28:01.763
Spit it out, soft boy.
Can't miss happy hour.

28:01.846 --> 28:02.931
I... Uh...

28:03.014 --> 28:05.475
I just wonder if, um, maybe
we're going in a little too hard

28:05.558 --> 28:08.103
on certain students
at Constance.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.521
I appreciate the concern.

28:10.230 --> 28:13.316
You're... an emotional guy.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.319
Real tied into your core.
It's cool.

28:16.403 --> 28:19.114
But this Davis stuff,
we're at the forefront.

28:19.197 --> 28:22.450
All the other places,
they're looking to us
to break it.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.911
We cracked a mil
'cause of this story.

28:24.994 --> 28:26.621
Do you realize
where that puts us?

28:26.704 --> 28:27.622
The big time, my man.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.667
Sure, okay, fine.

28:30.750 --> 28:34.129
But what if this reporting
hurts his daughter?

28:34.212 --> 28:36.631
She didn't do anything.
She's just his kid.

28:36.714 --> 28:38.299
Ever seen someone run
who wasn't guilty?

28:39.008 --> 28:40.635
JC's our 21st-century OJ.

28:40.718 --> 28:43.430
If we don't catch her,
someone else will.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.639
We don't have a choice.

28:44.722 --> 28:47.392
If you don't like it, you could
always give me your fob and...

28:47.892 --> 28:47.934
opt out.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.396
Ow.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.276
My foam's almost milk again.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.112
Is that a euphemism?

28:59.821 --> 29:01.030
We've been here a long time.

29:01.114 --> 29:04.325
Yeah, uh, we have.
You're right.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.660
Can I get you another one?

29:06.911 --> 29:08.663
If you are trying to put me
in cardiac arrest,

29:08.746 --> 29:10.707
might I suggest
a more fun way to do it?

29:12.500 --> 29:15.545
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yes.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.467
One sec.

29:23.553 --> 29:24.929
What are you still doing here?

29:25.013 --> 29:26.681
I'm just waiting
for Jamison to get off.

29:27.515 --> 29:27.724
Is that on the table?

29:29.934 --> 29:31.936
Get off work!

29:32.020 --> 29:33.396
Which he's about to. He's just
getting his things right now.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.772
So you are planning on leaving?

29:37.150 --> 29:38.818
- Are you?
- I don't know.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.987
Why do I feel
like you're waiting
for me to make a move

29:41.070 --> 29:42.864
so then you can make a move?
I'm confused.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.324
'Cause that's exactly
what I'm doing!

29:44.407 --> 29:46.201
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

29:46.284 --> 29:47.327
I'm not sure!

29:47.410 --> 29:48.620
I feel like we're in
a John Woo movie

29:48.703 --> 29:50.497
when we're pointing guns
at each other's heads!

29:50.580 --> 29:51.539
That is very much...

29:51.623 --> 29:55.585
not an allusion that resonates
with me in any way.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.671
So, where we going?

29:58.755 --> 30:01.216
I don't know!
Aki, any suggestions?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.142
I think you're good
to sit up now, you know?

30:14.270 --> 30:16.189
Thanks.

30:17.357 --> 30:20.485
I'm sorry that I never responded
to any of your texts.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.239
Look, there's no reason
to apologize, all right?

30:24.322 --> 30:26.824
I just... want you to know
that I'm here for you.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.078
Well, if I didn't know it
before,

30:30.161 --> 30:31.246
I definitely know it now.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.335
Where are we going, exactly?

30:37.961 --> 30:40.046
- Bemelmans.
- No way.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.090
Yeah.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.717
Is this a place
I should know about?

30:44.801 --> 30:47.929
So, it's this great old bar
that has live music.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.056
It's in the Carlyle, and...

30:50.139 --> 30:52.934
Obie and I just used to go there
all the time as kids.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.228
Yeah.
My parents have this thing
for the Beluga.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.772
I used to go hang out
in the kitchen with the chefs
and eat crème brûlée.

30:57.855 --> 30:59.691
They'd even let me play
with the, uh-- the blowtorch.

30:59.774 --> 31:00.942
Yeah, until Helena realized
you were missing

31:01.025 --> 31:04.946
and made you write apology notes
to all the staff on napkins.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.995
Yeah. That was a long time ago,
though.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.705
Still, it's a good memory.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.626
Oh, shit.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.128
That sounds like...

31:20.211 --> 31:21.796
"Spotted. First Daughter
of Disrepute

31:21.879 --> 31:24.424
sneaking off
on a road less traveled."

31:26.968 --> 31:29.178
<i>They say,
"If you know, you know."</i>

31:29.262 --> 31:30.305
<i>So did you, JC?</i>

31:30.388 --> 31:33.099
<i>-The people deserve an answer.</i>

31:33.182 --> 31:37.812
<i>And since you won't provide one,
it's come to this. An open call.</i>

31:37.895 --> 31:40.440
<i>First follower to prove JC's
offish stance</i>

31:40.523 --> 31:43.359
<i>with Daddy Davis wins.</i>

31:43.443 --> 31:45.820
<i>Extra points for following
a rule I hold close.</i>

31:45.903 --> 31:47.739
<i>"If you don't have
anything nice to say,</i>

31:47.822 --> 31:51.701
<i>slide into my DMs
and anon away."</i>

31:51.784 --> 31:53.911
He doesn't care
about right or wrong.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.998
He's obsessed with power,
with winning.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.958
Well, we just need to find a tip
that's more valuable,

31:59.042 --> 32:02.253
that might make him lean
in a different direction.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.755
So, is that like, your type?

32:04.922 --> 32:07.216
- What? Jordan, that's--
- I don't know why I said that.

32:08.134 --> 32:09.552
Is there anything
I can do to help?

32:09.636 --> 32:12.388
Just hang with me a bit?

32:12.472 --> 32:14.015
Keep an eye out
for any good tips

32:14.098 --> 32:15.433
not related to Julien,

32:15.516 --> 32:16.893
and I can find a spin

32:16.976 --> 32:19.145
that makes them
more alluring to Scott?

32:22.940 --> 32:25.193
<i>GG's activated the city.</i>

32:25.276 --> 32:27.028
<i>We were about to head in
for our treatments</i>

32:27.111 --> 32:29.530
<i>and we heard the whole staff
talking about it.</i>

32:29.614 --> 32:32.450
Gossip Girl's not going to stop
until she finds you, JC.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.077
Well, we have to make sure
that they don't.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.412
But how?
It's not like I blend in.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.998
<i>-Good luck. We're here for you.</i>
Thanks, girls.

32:45.463 --> 32:48.132
- What's with all the Santas?
- SantaCon.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.176
A con?
They're all over the streets.

32:50.259 --> 32:51.427
Shouldn't they be inside?

32:51.511 --> 32:54.222
No, con actually doesn't stand
for convention in this case.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.390
Yeah, more like contagion.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.851
It's an unsanctioned holiday
for day-drinking frat boys

32:58.935 --> 33:00.520
and day traders
to play dress-up.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.021
- Jesus!
- No! Santa!

33:03.940 --> 33:05.566
Ew!

33:07.819 --> 33:08.861
It was canceled last year
because of COVID,

33:08.945 --> 33:11.072
which means it will be
extra bad this year.

33:11.155 --> 33:14.075
They should hand out
pepper spray on every corner.

33:14.158 --> 33:14.909
It'd be a good day
to commit a crime.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.829
Nobody could find you.

33:17.912 --> 33:20.164
It is a crime. Against humanity.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.543
I have an idea of how to keep
Gossip Girl off our tracks.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.046
Dress up as Santa?

33:27.130 --> 33:29.590
- I am not that basic.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.385
<i>Hey there.</i>
- Girls, I have a plan.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.637
<i>I'll get Audrey and Ak,
you get Max.</i>

33:34.721 --> 33:35.888
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.766
<i>Hello?
Hey!</i>

33:38.850 --> 33:39.350
Does that make sense?

33:39.434 --> 33:40.768
<i>-Yes.</i>
- Okay.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.937
I'll send you my logins now.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.523
Let Operation
JC-And-Be-Seen commence.

33:47.233 --> 33:50.194
Okay, um... So, should we divide
and conquer?

33:50.278 --> 33:51.112
- Split up?
- They don't know each other.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.823
It'd be weird to ask them
to go together.

33:54.949 --> 33:57.201
Baby, now I know
you're playing dumb.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.120
This isn't about me.
This is about you.

34:00.037 --> 34:01.080
I think you're scared.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.583
We just came out
of a weird place.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.917
I don't wanna go back.

34:05.001 --> 34:08.713
Maybe that weird place existed
so we could get here?

34:10.381 --> 34:12.133
You.

34:12.216 --> 34:15.887
You two are going to the LES.
Good luck.

34:16.345 --> 34:17.805
And you...

34:17.889 --> 34:20.349
I hope you like heights.
Come on.

35:43.182 --> 35:45.393
Bianca said she's having a party
on the Great Lawn!

35:45.476 --> 35:47.854
She's also at the Guerlain Spa
with Monet?

35:47.937 --> 35:50.731
And at Dogpound with Zoya?

35:50.815 --> 35:52.358

Instead, shenanigans.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.739
Sorry. I don't mean
to kill the buzz.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.365
Do shenanigans happen
so often for you

36:41.449 --> 36:44.243
- that they no longer excite you?

36:47.204 --> 36:48.331
Yes!

36:52.501 --> 36:54.211
What?

36:56.088 --> 36:57.089
Nothing.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.107
I've wanted to do that all day.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.318
Was that okay?

37:19.654 --> 37:21.030
It was exactly what I needed.

37:36.671 --> 37:39.632
If this is how you're breaking
the official divorce to me,

37:39.715 --> 37:41.300
Pops, it's a tad on the nose.

37:42.551 --> 37:45.221
- Uh... Take a good look around.
- Depressing.

37:46.847 --> 37:48.891
This is the first garden
I designed.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.102
Oh.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.271
- It's terrible.
Yeah.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.942
This is where I grew up, Max.

38:00.027 --> 38:01.696
You never took me here.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.865
You know, when I was 12,
I asked my mom for a garden.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.535
She hated that I liked flowers.

38:07.618 --> 38:09.245
She wanted me to be a man.

38:09.328 --> 38:12.039
Dress formally,
become a lawyer, marry up.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.749
'Cause she'd married down,
you know?

38:14.959 --> 38:17.378
So when she said no,
I just did it anyway.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.506
Yeah. She never came back here.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.258
How the front looked,
that's all she cared about.

38:22.341 --> 38:25.636
So I worked late at night,
early in the morning,

38:26.679 --> 38:29.015
after she'd pass out drunk,

38:29.098 --> 38:31.475
one of her Rotary Club meetings.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.770
And in the summer,
when it-- when it bloomed

38:34.854 --> 38:36.647
and she saw what I'd done,

38:36.731 --> 38:38.232
instead of being taken by it,
which was my hope...

38:40.693 --> 38:43.070
she took me upstairs
and locked me in my room,

38:43.154 --> 38:46.032
and she had this
whole thing torn out

38:46.115 --> 38:48.326
while I-- I watched
from that window right there.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.830
And then her cold shoulder.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.627
I did everything to get her
to love me again.

39:00.212 --> 39:03.924
I denied who I was, I...
I brought home girls...

39:06.010 --> 39:08.387
Hell, and then, I--
I even applied for law school.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.390
And then, your dad came along.

39:12.975 --> 39:14.685
He took me out of that darkness.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.482
He never stopped blooming.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.609
But the more vibrant he became,

39:23.194 --> 39:25.154
the more I returned
to the darkness.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.532
I began to see
all of his color...

39:29.200 --> 39:31.660
the way she saw my garden,

39:31.744 --> 39:33.871
as a... unsanctioned violation.

39:35.539 --> 39:39.543
So, whatever time he needs
to take to try and forgive me,

39:40.169 --> 39:40.294
I'll wait...

39:42.713 --> 39:44.548
which means you have
to wait too, I'm afraid.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.218
I don't know for how long.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.261
You know, he could wake up next
week and say, "Come home,"

39:49.345 --> 39:50.763
or he could say, "That's it."

39:51.639 --> 39:52.807
No.

39:55.059 --> 39:58.229
The one thing I'll ask
is... don't be like me.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.649
Don't inherit this.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.692
If you feel something,
even if it's hard to admit,

40:03.776 --> 40:05.611
just say it.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.463
Can you take me back?

40:24.547 --> 40:25.464
There are two people
I've got to talk to.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.601
What if I DMed the wrong Carmen?

40:37.685 --> 40:39.520
No. You've been following
each other for years, okay?

40:39.603 --> 40:41.897
- You got the right one.
- How do you know?

40:42.648 --> 40:43.607
'Cause there she is.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.236
I thought
we'd be meeting alone...

40:47.319 --> 40:50.447
Oh, this is my sister.
You can trust her.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.783
I was just keeping her company
till you arrived.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.493
- I can--
Stay, please.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.918
We just wanted you to know
that we think we have proof

41:03.002 --> 41:04.044
that can help. Solid proof.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.005
Messages, from an old phone.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.632
Right, so you said.

41:08.716 --> 41:12.595
I can see why this is a bit
confusing for you, Julien,

41:12.678 --> 41:15.389
which is why I came today,
to tell you in person.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.224
I have no memory

41:17.308 --> 41:18.434
of what happened that night
with your dad.

41:18.517 --> 41:22.104
But, in your text to him,
you said that--

41:22.188 --> 41:25.482
That I didn't remember.
I wish I did.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.735
Something always felt off
about that night, but--

41:27.818 --> 41:28.861
You're not alone.

41:29.945 --> 41:30.988
There were more women.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.741
A lot more.

41:33.824 --> 41:37.620
And we thought if you could talk
with them and compare stories--

41:37.703 --> 41:38.913
It's not worth it to me.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.789
I have a great career,
a husband.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.251

Ms. Calloway, but you wanted
to know if the media arrived?

41:50.674 --> 41:51.634
I've just heard.

41:53.594 --> 41:53.636
I have to go.

41:55.221 --> 41:55.971
Uh-- Come with us.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.182
We can keep talking.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.727
I appreciate everything that
you're trying to do here.

42:01.810 --> 42:04.188
I'm not the person to help you.
I'm sorry.

42:06.523 --> 42:08.609
- How bad is it out there?
<i>Real bad.</i>

42:08.692 --> 42:09.777
<i>And getting worse.</i>

42:10.694 --> 42:11.487
I have an idea.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.620
Julien, get in.

42:25.501 --> 42:26.752
<i>It worked.
They're following me.</i>

42:26.835 --> 42:28.462
- Great.
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

42:28.545 --> 42:30.631
Get her off the street.
I'll text you where to meet us.

got into my head about it.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.077

44:25.829 --> 44:26.955
This is pointless.

44:27.831 --> 44:29.124
Yo, we'll find somebody else
to talk.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.418
No, I mean, look around.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.212
The world is filled
with entitled toxic men

44:33.295 --> 44:35.923
who do whatever they want.

44:36.006 --> 44:37.257
No fucking accountability.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.259
And it's up to us
to either smile pretty
when they ask

44:39.343 --> 44:41.178
or run the other direction.

44:41.261 --> 44:42.763
And if we, God forbid,
push back,

44:42.846 --> 44:44.098
there's going to be
another man waiting

44:44.181 --> 44:45.682
to tell us
that we're overreacting

44:45.766 --> 44:47.851
- or crying wolf!
Free hugs!

44:47.935 --> 44:50.229

make a difference.

44:50.312 --> 44:51.563

to all the women,

44:51.647 --> 44:54.441
- it was a mistake.
Free hugs!

44:54.525 --> 44:58.862
It takes a whistle
to silence a woman,

44:58.946 --> 45:00.989
and an entire army
to take down one man.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.784
And you get a hug--

45:03.867 --> 45:06.161
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You are!

45:06.662 --> 45:08.122
All of you are!

45:09.706 --> 45:11.041

Okay.

45:44.241 --> 45:45.659
Uh... Never mind.

45:45.742 --> 45:47.453
Change of plans.
We are leaving the car behind.

45:47.536 --> 45:49.538
Where are we going?

45:49.621 --> 45:52.332
Uh... Wherever it is,
we're on foot.

45:52.416 --> 45:53.792
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Whoa!

45:55.252 --> 45:56.420
Hey, buddy.

45:56.503 --> 45:57.421
I bet you fifty dollars that you
won't run around the block

45:57.504 --> 45:59.673
with nothing but your hat on.

45:59.756 --> 46:01.508
- Fifteen bucks?
- Uh... Sure. Yeah.

46:01.592 --> 46:02.885
- That works too.
- You're on.

46:04.052 --> 46:04.887
Okay. Thank you.

46:08.557 --> 46:10.350
Well, now we blend in.

46:11.643 --> 46:11.894
Riley responded.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.981
She wants to meet right now.

46:16.064 --> 46:18.859
She wants to come forward
about what my dad did to her.

46:18.942 --> 46:19.943
There she is!

46:20.027 --> 46:20.611
- It's Julien!
Right there,
right there!

46:20.694 --> 46:22.696
Right, let's go! Come on! Run!

46:28.452 --> 46:28.911
- What's your problem, man?
- Okay!

46:50.474 --> 46:51.433
Dad?

46:51.517 --> 46:52.893
All this time,
I thought you were in your room,

46:52.976 --> 46:54.895
and then I open Gossip Girl
and see you running down

46:54.978 --> 46:56.939
<i>a midtown street right now,
being chased.</i>

46:57.022 --> 46:58.732
- Where exactly are you?
- Don't be mad,

46:58.815 --> 47:00.359
but we went to talk
to one of the women,

47:00.442 --> 47:01.735
and it actually worked out

47:01.818 --> 47:03.570
because now we're on the way
to see Riley.

47:03.946 --> 47:05.072
Riley?

47:05.155 --> 47:06.740
As in the person
Lauren Thompson lied for?

47:06.823 --> 47:09.201
Yes! I think she wants
to come forward.

47:09.284 --> 47:09.785
She said she has proof.

47:09.868 --> 47:11.912

- What?
<i>-If Riley came forward
right now,</i>

47:19.086 --> 47:20.796
she'd be proving Lauren lied.

47:20.879 --> 47:23.549
<i>Lauren would be sued
for libel and defamation.</i>

47:23.632 --> 47:25.926
So, what? You're saying
we let Davis get away with it?

47:26.009 --> 47:27.427
No. You just need to wait
a little longer.

47:27.511 --> 47:28.637
Dad, that's bullshit!

47:28.720 --> 47:30.889
I agree.
But I didn't make the rules.

47:30.973 --> 47:33.058
Lauren lied, even if it was
for a good reason.

47:33.141 --> 47:36.103

the entire case into question</i>

47:42.234 --> 47:44.611
He told people
to track her like prey.

47:44.695 --> 47:48.031
Gossip Girl is this close
to live streaming a snuff film.

47:48.115 --> 47:50.325
- We have to do something.
- We have no game left to play.

Hi, Nick. I just saw
Gossip Girl. Insane.

47:59.042 --> 48:01.795

Are the girls okay?

48:01.878 --> 48:03.797

the best location?

48:13.557 --> 48:15.475
Yeah, it's, um-- it's perfect.

48:15.559 --> 48:16.810
As per Twitter,
you were already here today.

48:16.893 --> 48:18.270
Nobody would think
you'd come back.

48:21.857 --> 48:22.399
That's her.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.863
All right. You gonna be okay?

48:31.241 --> 48:32.242
No.

48:48.675 --> 48:49.968
I don't know why I like
this place.

48:50.052 --> 48:53.972
Most of the artists
were horrible people, but...

48:54.056 --> 48:56.683
somehow I still feel seen
by some of their work.

48:58.477 --> 49:01.188
How long has it been?
Six, seven years?

49:01.772 --> 49:03.482
Something like that.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.026
You look the same.

49:06.109 --> 49:08.528
- So do you.
- Don't lie, girl.

49:13.241 --> 49:14.618

49:18.622 --> 49:20.582

other women and...

49:20.666 --> 49:23.001
I don't know what to think
about any of it.

49:23.085 --> 49:23.835
I just wish there was
a way to make up

49:23.919 --> 49:26.171
for what happened
to you somehow.

49:26.254 --> 49:27.964
You have nothing to make up for.

49:28.840 --> 49:29.925
Then why do I feel so guilty?

49:31.009 --> 49:34.721
- How could I not know?
- He is your father.

49:38.642 --> 49:40.894
Could you tell me what--

49:40.977 --> 49:44.147
I'd rather not.
With you.

49:46.608 --> 49:47.818
I understand.

49:51.446 --> 49:52.572
It's Riley Love!

49:52.656 --> 49:54.282

and don't say a word.

49:55.325 --> 49:55.742
What are you doing?

49:55.826 --> 49:58.245
Going live as GG.

49:59.121 --> 50:00.872
her dad's survivors
come forward,

50:00.956 --> 50:03.750
it'll exonerate
her once and for all.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.377
We can't hear from here.

50:05.460 --> 50:07.879
It's 2021. This shit

than a ten-second delay.

50:13.218 --> 50:18.765
Look, I wanted to see you, um,
before I told anyone else.

50:18.849 --> 50:21.601
I just-- I wanted to make sure
that you were gonna be okay

50:21.685 --> 50:26.273
- if and when I come out and--
Oh, God!

50:26.356 --> 50:29.109
My whole existence is built
on speaking my truth,

50:29.192 --> 50:31.153
and now I'm here to ask you
not to speak yours.

50:33.947 --> 50:34.948
Excuse me?

50:36.032 --> 50:36.992
At least not yet.

50:40.704 --> 50:41.913
What's happening?

50:46.960 --> 50:50.172
- So you don't believe me?
- Of course I do.

50:51.423 --> 50:53.341
I just want
everyone else to, too.

50:53.425 --> 50:55.969
I can't let Lauren take
the fall for me.

50:57.137 --> 50:58.138
I know.

50:58.221 --> 51:01.475
But if you speak out now,
it will show Lauren lied.

51:01.558 --> 51:03.643
That could ruin any case
against my dad.

51:03.727 --> 51:06.521
You could both be discredited,
and so would any future claim.

51:06.605 --> 51:08.148
