00:02.230 --> 00:03.664
That was the last box.

00:03.730 --> 00:05.530
Goodwill will be here
in about an hour.

00:05.596 --> 00:07.564
I gotta say, givin'
away all those clothes

00:07.630 --> 00:09.064
was pretty generous of you.

00:09.130 --> 00:11.397
I figured "Hey, why shouldn't
the less fortunate

00:11.464 --> 00:13.730
be as chic as I was
two years ago.

00:15.464 --> 00:17.697
You're just too good
for this world.

00:17.764 --> 00:19.697
Well, any world actually.

00:21.997 --> 00:23.364
Hey, people.

00:23.430 --> 00:25.397
‐ That coat!
‐ Isn't it sharp?

00:25.464 --> 00:29.464
I found it in a box
on the stoop.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.564
No, Max. This is my coat.
I'm givin' it to charity.

00:32.630 --> 00:35.130
Well, charity
begins at home.

00:35.197 --> 00:37.697
And since I'm in your home,
thank you.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.697
No, you can't have it.

00:42.764 --> 00:46.197
Yeah? Well, said coat was found
outside in an unmarked box.

00:46.264 --> 00:49.097
Proving that possession was
abandoned by its previous owner

00:49.164 --> 00:54.364
or in layman terms,
finders keepers, losers weepers.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.364
I want my coat back.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.930
You don't have the right
accessories to go with it.

00:58.997 --> 01:02.804
Oh! Since I found me a $20 in
this pocket, I can be me some.

01:02.870 --> 01:05.704
Ah‐ah! That‐that's mine.
Max, that's mine.

Hey, Cookie Nose, I was
especially bowled over

01:42.970 --> 01:46.837
by your delicious
white instant rice.

01:46.904 --> 01:48.704
Thank you, Tastebud.

01:48.770 --> 01:51.904
My secret is distilled water.

01:51.970 --> 01:54.970
You know, I can't believe that
you guys still use pet names

01:55.037 --> 01:57.537
after a whole year dating.

01:57.604 --> 01:59.037
It must stop.

02:00.604 --> 02:03.344
Correction. It will be
a whole year tomorrow.

02:03.410 --> 02:05.677
So, how are you two gonna
celebrate your anniversary?

02:05.744 --> 02:08.344
Another night
of chastity, hmm?

02:08.410 --> 02:10.344
Go ahead, poke fun.

02:10.410 --> 02:12.644
But, Obie, tells me he's got
something special planned

02:12.710 --> 02:13.744
for our anniversary.

02:13.810 --> 02:15.810
Really, I don't wanna
spoil the surprise.

02:15.877 --> 02:18.143
Let's just say it involves
going somewhere nice

02:18.210 --> 02:20.644
and eating something good.

02:20.710 --> 02:22.144
I don't get anniversaries.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.177
You celebrate looking at
the same creep everyday

02:24.244 --> 02:26.744
for a whole year
and then you have a party

02:26.810 --> 02:29.310
so you can start looking
at them all over again.

02:29.377 --> 02:31.310
What is the freakin' point?

02:36.044 --> 02:38.977
You see, that's the way
we humans express emotion.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.344
Ho!

02:44.344 --> 02:47.110
So, Kyle, did you get
Obie's hat size?

02:47.177 --> 02:49.344
I have a fedora
all picked out for him.

02:49.410 --> 02:52.210
He's a seven and a half,
and I almost got caught.

02:52.277 --> 02:55.777
And I don't know how to explain
myself to a bald man wakin' up

02:55.844 --> 02:57.944
with a string tied
around his head.

02:58.010 --> 03:01.584
Hey, um.. Sorry to interrupt
your tat‐tat about my present

03:01.650 --> 03:04.384
but, Shorty, we gotta go
plan our anniversary.

Not yours and mine,
mine and Synclaire's.

(Regine)
Hi, you guys.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.750
We're gonna clear outta here
too, so you can study.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.517
‐ We're gonna be at Max's.
‐ Alright.

03:14.584 --> 03:18.284
Max's apartment? Oh, oh!
Let's bring a camera.

03:18.350 --> 03:20.950
I want proof that
this mythical place exists.

03:22.684 --> 03:24.650
It's not like
I never had you over.

03:24.717 --> 03:26.950
Remember when you picked me up
from the airport?

03:27.017 --> 03:28.950
I let you carry my bags in.

03:32.484 --> 03:33.817
Ta‐da!

03:38.717 --> 03:39.984
Alright, Max.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.550
You're not going to keep
wearing that coat, are you?

03:42.617 --> 03:43.884
Hell yeah.

03:45.784 --> 03:50.350
Out of all the coats that were
my before, this is my favorite.

03:50.417 --> 03:54.817
It's a 100% pure virgin wool.
Mmm, snuggly.

03:54.884 --> 03:58.017
And don't even get me started
on the silky satin lining.

04:02.790 --> 04:06.190
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it.

04:06.257 --> 04:08.757
Hey, Regine, don't you have
a coat just like that?

04:12.324 --> 04:14.057
Synclaire, why are you
fluffing the pillows?

04:14.124 --> 04:16.089
I want the place to look nice.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.390
Jon Marc's the best student
in my psychology class.

04:18.457 --> 04:20.390
It's an honor
to study with him.

04:20.457 --> 04:23.957
Jon Marc?
That's a sexy sounding name.

04:24.024 --> 04:25.957
What does he look like?

04:26.024 --> 04:28.257
He's attractive, if you
like the model type.

04:28.324 --> 04:31.257
You know, tall, buffed,
three dimples, huh.

04:39.323 --> 04:41.924
I've always been curious
about psychology.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.490
Maybe I should hangout for
a while. Probe his mind.

04:44.557 --> 04:48.690
You know, get a little
intellectual stimulation.

04:48.757 --> 04:50.290
Max, people are
talking about you.

04:50.357 --> 04:53.624
They're staring to call you a
genius if you know what I mean.

05:04.830 --> 05:07.097
Here I am.
I look different at home.

05:12.030 --> 05:14.664
That's funny.
How you doin', Synclaire?

05:14.730 --> 05:17.330
Yes, we'll be across the street
if you need anything.

05:17.397 --> 05:19.330
Call me.
Here's my card.

05:21.264 --> 05:22.730
My home number's
on the back.

05:22.797 --> 05:25.130
‐ Dang! You are really forward.
‐ Yeah.

05:25.197 --> 05:27.430
[laughing]
Well, you see,
this is a new method.

05:27.497 --> 05:32.497
Usually, she just clubs men and
then drags 'em back to her cave.

05:32.564 --> 05:35.164
Okay, now. Okay.
Alright, let's go.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.464
Hey, nice place.

05:40.530 --> 05:42.964
Thank you. Can I get you
something to drink?

05:43.030 --> 05:46.297
Water, coffee,
blueberry smoothie?

05:46.364 --> 05:49.730
That's okay. We should probably
just hit the books, huh?

05:49.797 --> 05:53.097
So, what are you having
most trouble with?

05:53.164 --> 05:55.930
Chapters One to 22.

05:55.997 --> 05:57.430
I really need help.

05:57.497 --> 05:59.464
Hey, listen to me.
It's my pleasure, okay?

05:59.530 --> 06:01.504
I'm here for as long
as it takes.

06:03.737 --> 06:04.837
Um..

06:04.904 --> 06:07.304
Alrighty! Uh..

06:07.370 --> 06:11.837
My first question is why was
that guy Pavlov so mean to dogs?

06:14.337 --> 06:16.204
Uh, thank you.

06:16.270 --> 06:18.970
And if everything goes perfectly
at dinner tomorrow night

06:19.037 --> 06:22.037
there'll be an extra buck
in there for you.

06:22.104 --> 06:24.837
No, I ain't kiddin'.
I mean, I got a bank.

06:27.237 --> 06:29.170
That was quite impressive, man.

06:29.237 --> 06:31.970
You know, the Moreal
is hottest restaurant in town?

06:32.037 --> 06:33.637
Wait! How'd you
get a reservation?

06:33.704 --> 06:35.670
I just told them
it was my anniversary

06:35.737 --> 06:40.504
and I explained my Uncle Bill
Cosby wouldn't be attending.

06:40.570 --> 06:42.670
And I ordered their specialty.

06:42.737 --> 06:45.604
Which we have to arrange
one day in advance.

06:45.670 --> 06:50.837

<i>de ela sauce crevettes.</i>

06:50.904 --> 06:51.870

what the hell it is.

Oh, but wait.
Pullin' out all the stops.

06:58.837 --> 07:00.810
I reserved a limo
for the entire evening.

07:00.877 --> 07:02.710
Oh, that's some
classy touch, man.

07:02.777 --> 07:05.277
Yeah. A friend of mine
who runs a funeral parlor..

07:05.344 --> 07:08.610
...and he said all he had
to do is drop off an urn

07:08.677 --> 07:12.677
on the way to the restaurant
and we're rollin' in style.

07:12.744 --> 07:14.710
Obie, you puling out
all the stops, huh?

07:14.777 --> 07:16.710
Well, Synclaire deserves it.

07:16.777 --> 07:20.044
Besides, the one year mark in
any relationship is critical.

07:20.110 --> 07:22.077
'Course you wouldn't know that.

07:22.144 --> 07:24.077
Well, you know, this is true.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.544
My situation could be better
characterised as a rut.

07:27.610 --> 07:31.377
An endless stream of beautiful
women one after the other..

07:31.444 --> 07:34.144
...after the other..

07:34.210 --> 07:36.777
You know, but I digress. Um..

07:36.844 --> 07:39.077
I assume you got Synclaire
an appropriate gift.

07:39.144 --> 07:40.810
Feast your eyes.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.377
I had this charm bracelet made
of all of her favorite things.

07:44.444 --> 07:48.244
You got a little dog,
a kitty cat, a smiley face

07:48.310 --> 07:50.777
a little daisy.

07:50.844 --> 07:53.744
A skull and crossbones?

07:53.810 --> 07:55.810
Eh! She got a dark side.

07:59.344 --> 08:01.517
Okay. It says here

08:01.584 --> 08:05.017
that every dream reveals itself
as a psychological structure.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.017
What does that mean?

08:07.984 --> 08:08.950
Huh?

08:09.017 --> 08:10.584
Oh, Freud. Um..

08:10.650 --> 08:13.150
Oh, I believe he meant that
dreams contain hidden clues

08:13.217 --> 08:15.450
‐ to your personality.
‐ Mmm.

08:15.517 --> 08:18.784
I wonder what Freud would think
of the dream I had last night.

08:18.850 --> 08:21.084
I was an axe murderer.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.650
And everywhere I went, I went
hacking away at people.

08:23.717 --> 08:26.117
Whack, whack, whack,
whack, whack, whack.

08:26.184 --> 08:28.150
Does this mean I have
a psychological problem?

08:28.217 --> 08:31.484
‐ No. I think you are so great.
‐ Mm. Oh, but wait. But wait

08:31.550 --> 08:35.150
Then Khadijah pops up
out of a toaster..

08:35.217 --> 08:38.484
...and chases me around in an
amusement park with a wet fish.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.049
You are so imaginative,
Synclaire.

08:41.116 --> 08:43.083
I bet you even dream
in color too.

08:43.150 --> 08:45.884
I do. I do. I do.

08:45.950 --> 08:48.984
Except the dream I keep having
about penguins in the snow.

08:51.584 --> 08:52.850
But you know what?

08:52.917 --> 08:56.084
Knowing Freud, I bet he'd turn
that into something sexual.

08:56.150 --> 08:59.890
You know, Freud understood
that people are sexual beings.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.557
Wow!

09:01.624 --> 09:05.990
You really get this stuff.
Let me get that down.

09:06.057 --> 09:08.724
You know, I'm really glad we're
taking this class together.

09:08.790 --> 09:09.824
Mm‐hm.

09:09.890 --> 09:11.824
I really like
spending time with you.

09:16.024 --> 09:17.457
Um.. What?

09:17.524 --> 09:19.124
Oh my god!
Um.. Um..

09:19.190 --> 09:21.690
‐ What? What is it?
‐ Um, I have a boyfriend.

09:21.757 --> 09:24.257
‐ Oh, hey! I didn't know.
‐ I know. You gotta go.

09:24.324 --> 09:26.024
‐ Coat, bag, go!
‐ But, Synclaire..

09:26.090 --> 09:27.190
‐ Please go.
‐ I'm sorry.

09:27.257 --> 09:28.857
I know.
Go. Please go.

09:28.924 --> 09:30.857
No smoothie,
nothing to drink. Go.

09:30.924 --> 09:33.224
‐ Bye. Go!
‐ Synclaire..

09:33.290 --> 09:34.557
Oh my god!

09:46.867 --> 09:47.834
[door opening]

09:48.497 --> 09:49.428
Oh, hey.

09:49.495 --> 09:51.228
What're you guys
doing home so early?

09:51.295 --> 09:55.095
We sat down to watch a movie,
but ol' Max had to eat

09:55.161 --> 09:57.861
was a half a bottle
of lemon juice..

09:57.928 --> 10:02.268
...and a head of lettuce that
looked like lion.

10:02.335 --> 10:05.968
And she stole that from us
two months ago.

10:06.035 --> 10:07.001
Thief.

10:09.435 --> 10:12.235
By the by, did notice
these beautiful buttons?

10:14.368 --> 10:16.875
‐ Where's Jon Marc?
‐ He had to leave.

10:16.941 --> 10:20.050
Helped me finish studying and he
had to leave, therefore he left.

10:20.117 --> 10:22.850
‐ Alright?
‐ Okay.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.984
You don't believe me, do you?

10:25.050 --> 10:27.317
Well, I'm telling
it's the truth.

10:27.384 --> 10:30.717
Finished studying,
he left, he had to go.

10:30.784 --> 10:34.084
Okay, he kissed me.
Satisfied?

10:34.150 --> 10:35.150
What the devil!

10:35.217 --> 10:37.817
Oh, sucker‐sucker now.

10:39.884 --> 10:41.150
‐ Hey!
‐ What?

10:41.217 --> 10:44.217
I told him I had a boyfriend
and asked him to leave.

10:44.284 --> 10:46.250
Well, I would have done
the same thing.

10:46.317 --> 10:48.050
I'd have given him
a sponge‐bath first.

10:48.117 --> 10:50.050
But that's just me.

10:52.017 --> 10:56.017
We were just sitting here
discussing dreams and sex..

10:56.084 --> 10:59.517
...and then I didn't even know
where he kissed me..

10:59.584 --> 11:02.390
...with some very soft lips.

11:02.457 --> 11:04.390
I'm so ashamed.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.224
Look, is something not right
between you and Overton?

11:08.290 --> 11:10.290
No, I love Overton.

11:10.357 --> 11:13.024
He's everything a cheating
infidel like me could ever want.

11:14.624 --> 11:16.557
Please stop beating
yourself up.

11:16.624 --> 11:18.590
So you got a charge
from another powerline.

11:20.924 --> 11:24.024
Well, I know things will be
right when I confess to Overton.

11:24.090 --> 11:27.424
Why would you do that?

11:27.490 --> 11:29.157
Because I feel guilty.

11:29.224 --> 11:31.157
Guilt is a tricky emotion.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.457
It's put there by your parents
to stop you

11:33.524 --> 11:36.657
from doing things
that feel good.

11:36.724 --> 11:39.590
Don't lecture me, Max.
I'm taking a psychology class.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.590
I feel guilty
because I'm bad inside.

11:44.090 --> 11:47.090
Synclaire, if you tell Overton,
he will be devastated.

11:47.157 --> 11:49.324
Especially this close
to your anniversary.

11:49.390 --> 11:52.690
When you're about
to get a gift.

11:54.190 --> 11:57.357
I'll say, keep your
damn mouth shut.

11:57.424 --> 11:59.090
Trust me.

11:59.157 --> 12:01.330
Sometimes being honest
hurts peoples feelings.

12:01.397 --> 12:04.130
Like the time you had two
free tickets to see Madonna

12:04.197 --> 12:07.097
and told Regine you had one,
so you could take Max?

12:13.897 --> 12:17.230
They were really bad seats.
They were way up.

12:17.297 --> 12:21.164
And Madonna looked
like an ant.

12:21.230 --> 12:24.097
Tiny‐teeny little ant
just touching herself.

12:26.064 --> 12:29.230
The only thing that could have
made that concert better

12:29.297 --> 12:31.430
is if I was wearing this coat.

12:36.664 --> 12:40.130
I don't wanna hurt Obie, so
I'm gonna keep this to myself.

12:40.197 --> 12:41.664
Amen.

12:42.764 --> 12:45.897
Maybe I could talk
to God about it.

12:45.964 --> 12:50.330
But, then again,
Obie talks to God.

12:50.397 --> 12:53.264
But the big guy wouldn't
spill the beans, would he?

12:55.397 --> 12:57.064
[harp music]

13:07.904 --> 13:09.804
That was excellent.

13:09.870 --> 13:12.004
Now, here's a little
something for the band.

13:15.104 --> 13:17.070
Wow, Obie, this evening
has been so romantic.

13:17.137 --> 13:18.837
I don't deserve it.

13:18.904 --> 13:21.037
Of course you do.
We deserve each other.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.604
'Cause we have the perfect love
with a perfect couple

13:23.670 --> 13:25.604
and this is
the perfect night.

13:26.937 --> 13:29.137
Would the Monsieur Jones
and the lovely lady

13:29.204 --> 13:31.537
care for anything else?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.837
Oh, I couldn't be.

13:33.904 --> 13:37.570
That rum cake has already given
me quite a buzz. Thank you.

13:37.637 --> 13:40.504
‐ Just the check, Ori.
‐ Oui, Monsieur Jones

13:40.570 --> 13:42.070
And per your request

13:42.137 --> 13:44.470
I'll bring you those
tiny mints, you favor?

13:44.537 --> 13:46.704
Um..
Ooh‐la‐la

13:48.970 --> 13:51.470
I guess now would be
a good time for me

13:51.537 --> 13:53.037
to give you
my anniversary guilt.

13:53.104 --> 13:55.737
Gift.
Anniversary gift.

13:55.804 --> 13:59.644
I've been wondering all night
what was in this big hat box.

13:59.710 --> 14:01.510
Wow.

14:03.044 --> 14:05.144
Eh, this hat is bad.

14:05.210 --> 14:08.577
Kyle measured the string
just right.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.310
Aw, thanks, baby.
You're the best.

14:13.377 --> 14:15.310
No, I'm really not.

14:15.377 --> 14:17.310
Synclaire, you are to me.

14:17.377 --> 14:19.644
Now, it's your turn.

14:19.710 --> 14:22.710
Look, I know there's no gift
in the world that would equal

14:22.777 --> 14:24.910
what you've already given me.

14:24.977 --> 14:28.677
But please accept this
as a symbol of my love.

14:31.677 --> 14:34.377
Oh, Obie.

14:34.444 --> 14:38.077
‐ Now, now..
‐ I'm a slut.

14:41.144 --> 14:43.077
What are you talking about?

14:43.144 --> 14:45.644
And why are you
talking so loudly?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.644
I kissed another man.

14:48.977 --> 14:51.910
When did this happen?
When I went to the rest room?

14:53.144 --> 14:54.644
No, last night.

14:54.710 --> 14:57.210
I was studying with Jon Marc
and he kissed me.

14:57.277 --> 14:59.544
I didn't expect it.
It just happened.

14:59.610 --> 15:01.317
I'll kill him.

15:01.384 --> 15:04.050
No. No, he didn't know
I had a boyfriend.

15:04.117 --> 15:06.084
It was totally innocent.

15:07.417 --> 15:09.684
Did you kiss him back?

15:09.750 --> 15:11.717
No.

15:13.317 --> 15:16.750
You know, kissing is
such a strange thing.

15:16.817 --> 15:18.250
I guess..

15:18.317 --> 15:20.250
So this whole beautifully
planned evening

15:20.317 --> 15:22.084
has been one big lie?

15:22.150 --> 15:24.250
Overton, I've never
lied to you before

15:24.317 --> 15:26.250
and I never will again.

15:26.317 --> 15:28.884
Well, let me drop a little
bomb on you, girly.

15:31.317 --> 15:33.550
Our limo is owned by
a funeral parlor.

15:33.617 --> 15:36.117
Our driver is the embalmer.

15:38.217 --> 15:40.150
How you like me now?

15:41.184 --> 15:42.617
Obie, wait.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.917
Hey, kids, my coat
and I are here.

15:56.584 --> 15:59.250
Max, I have been looking
through these old catalogues

15:59.317 --> 16:01.257
and I cannot find
that coat anywhere.

16:01.324 --> 16:04.724
So, I am willing to
give you $300 for it.

16:04.790 --> 16:07.524
I paid 250 for it,
two years ago.

16:07.590 --> 16:10.090
Why don't you wait
till some idiot throws it out

16:10.157 --> 16:12.090
then you can have it for free.

16:15.090 --> 16:16.990
Max, you don't
need the coat.

16:17.057 --> 16:20.157
You have all that body hair
to keep you warm.

16:22.190 --> 16:26.390
And it all stands on an end
when I look at you.

16:26.457 --> 16:28.424
I want my coat back, Maxine.

16:28.490 --> 16:30.457
You left it outside.
You left it outside.

16:30.524 --> 16:31.857
Alright, hold that y'all.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.790
Ya'll just need
to chill the hell out.

16:34.857 --> 16:36.824
Acting like a couple
of eight‐year‐olds

16:36.890 --> 16:38.857
and I can't have this.

16:44.924 --> 16:47.290
‐ Max is my mommy now.
‐ Shut up..

16:50.990 --> 16:53.590
Come on, Obie,
just talk to me.

16:53.657 --> 16:54.757
No, woman.

16:54.824 --> 16:56.890
Damn, now I broke
my silence.

16:58.057 --> 16:59.764
Wait! Gossip!

17:02.230 --> 17:05.564
Overton Wakefield Jones,
you cannot ignore me forever.

17:05.630 --> 17:07.630
I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

17:09.497 --> 17:11.730
The girls were right.
I shouldn't have told you.

17:11.797 --> 17:15.097
Yeah, they're real geniuses
when it comes to relationships.

17:15.164 --> 17:18.864
‐ 'Hey‐‐'
‐ 'Don't!'

17:18.930 --> 17:20.864
Overton, I'm asking you

17:20.930 --> 17:22.864
lets please discuss this
like mature adults.

17:23.797 --> 17:25.730
Nope, don't wanna.

17:27.064 --> 17:28.230
Obie!

17:28.964 --> 17:30.730
Oh, that was juicy.

17:30.797 --> 17:32.730
I feel like a new woman.

17:34.864 --> 17:37.464
Overton, please beleive me.

17:37.530 --> 17:40.264
He was only here to help me
get a passing grade.

17:40.330 --> 17:44.364
And I suppose your lips
were going for extra credit.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.097
The whole thing
only lasted five seconds.

17:47.164 --> 17:50.964
Five seconds! You know
how long that is in lip time?

17:51.030 --> 17:52.964
Let's take a look, shall we?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.064
And go.

17:54.130 --> 17:57.297
Kissing, kissing, kissing..

17:57.364 --> 18:00.737
...still kissing, kissing.

18:00.804 --> 18:04.437
That's when you realized you
had a devoted boyfriend, huh?

18:06.004 --> 18:07.870
That's just mean.

18:07.937 --> 18:10.637
Sorry, if I offended your
delicate sensibility

18:10.704 --> 18:12.804
Ms. Drama Dance Synclaire.

18:14.870 --> 18:16.804
But I'm the victim here.

18:17.737 --> 18:21.170
What you did,
that hurt, girl.

18:23.737 --> 18:26.070
Overton, I'm so sorry.

18:26.137 --> 18:28.304
Maybe my lips
were touching his

18:28.370 --> 18:31.970
but my heart
is always with you.

18:32.037 --> 18:33.970
Look, if I didn't
really love you

18:34.037 --> 18:35.970
I wouldn't have told you.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.704
I mean, I wanna beleive that.

18:38.770 --> 18:41.504
But things were really
right between us

18:41.570 --> 18:43.504
this never would
have happened.

18:43.570 --> 18:44.770
[sighs]

18:44.837 --> 18:47.737
If there is something wrong,
I say we sit here

18:47.804 --> 18:49.404
review our relationship

18:49.470 --> 18:52.704
and try to figure where
the problem got started.

18:52.770 --> 18:54.637
Okay.

18:54.704 --> 18:56.970
Eighteen months ago

18:57.037 --> 18:59.337
I saw a moving van roll up

18:59.404 --> 19:01.344
saw you in the front seat

19:01.410 --> 19:03.344
and said, "That must be
Khadijah's cousin.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.210
She's kinda cute."

19:06.277 --> 19:08.577
And then I saw you
and I said

19:08.644 --> 19:11.310
"Oh, the handy man lives in
the building, how convenient."

19:15.277 --> 19:18.477
Then that first ray of hope,
your toaster broke.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.444
It did, didn't it?

19:23.510 --> 19:27.010
Got really quiet up there.
Maybe we should check on 'em.

19:28.777 --> 19:31.877
‐ Okay, I'm going in.
‐ I'm gonna cover you, girl.

19:31.944 --> 19:34.977
Back up, vultures.
It's my apartment, I'll go.

19:35.044 --> 19:37.077
Okay, but the second
you get up there

19:37.144 --> 19:39.710
call us and let us know
everything is cool.

19:39.777 --> 19:42.410
Yes, signal us.
Jump off the roof.

19:42.477 --> 19:45.677
And when you pass the window
flash the okay sign.

19:59.410 --> 20:01.350
Yeah, Khadijah.
Yeah, it's me.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.817
No, no, they're fine.
Everything is cool.

20:03.884 --> 20:07.484
No, you can't talk
to her right now.

20:07.550 --> 20:09.284
Trust me, trust me.

20:09.350 --> 20:11.450
She's busy.

20:24.184 --> 20:25.450
You know, Obie

20:25.517 --> 20:29.384
being with you is even more
amazing than I ever dreamed.

20:29.450 --> 20:31.484
And I dream in color.

20:33.417 --> 20:35.717
Yeah, just wish it
wasn't over so fast.

20:40.250 --> 20:43.017
Yeah, I'm sorry
I finished first.

20:46.050 --> 20:49.050
I know that we didnt think
that we were ready to go

20:49.117 --> 20:51.117
to this stage
in our realtionship

20:51.184 --> 20:54.991
But the way you ripped
my clothes off, mama

20:55.058 --> 20:57.291
I knew it was
about that time.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.931
I never realized how much
passion I'd saved up for you.

21:02.998 --> 21:05.764
Well, my Lothario old Uncle
Timmy used to say

21:05.831 --> 21:07.798
"Passion is like money.

21:07.864 --> 21:12.231
Time to save it up
and a time to spend it all."

21:13.931 --> 21:17.531
So, what you wanna do now?

21:19.298 --> 21:22.497
Um, take off the hat, daddy.

21:22.563 --> 21:24.497
This time I want you naked.

21:33.563 --> 21:35.030
[instrumental music]

21:36.563 --> 21:38.630
You finally got
that damn coat back?

21:38.697 --> 21:40.663
What'd you say
to Max to get it?

21:40.730 --> 21:42.863
I said his $400.

21:45.663 --> 21:48.697
Hey, Regine, that money you
gave me for that crummy coat

21:48.763 --> 21:50.097
really came in handy.

21:50.163 --> 21:53.430
I just booked myself on
a single ski weekend in Wale.

21:53.497 --> 21:55.630
And I'm going
to wear this.

21:55.697 --> 21:57.630
Where did you get this one?

21:58.663 --> 22:00.603
Same box I got that coat.

22:00.670 --> 22:03.103
Oh, I took a whole
lotta stuff.

22:04.837 --> 22:08.037
That's my sweater
and I want it back.

22:08.103 --> 22:10.503
Well, unless you have
another $400

22:10.570 --> 22:13.370
this sweater is
going to Colorado.

22:13.437 --> 22:17.137
Ski, ski, ski,
woosh, woosh, woosh.
