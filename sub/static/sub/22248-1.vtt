00:23.006 --> 00:25.931
- Thanks for volunteering.
- It wasn't for your benefit.

00:26.668 --> 00:28.076
Fair play.

00:28.732 --> 00:30.988
Glad you're my medic, though.
I need someone I can trust.

00:31.274 --> 00:33.165
I thought this was a
straightforward extraction?

00:33.194 --> 00:35.739
No, nothing's ever straightforward
in Aleppo. Not any more.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.274
Do we know the target?

00:38.458 --> 00:40.139
Final brief to be opened en route.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.933
But as you're here, it may be a child.

00:43.698 --> 00:45.834
Because women are so good with children?

00:47.153 --> 00:49.796
We don't know the
extent of any injuries...

00:50.429 --> 00:51.939
Three vehicles. We're in the middle.

00:51.945 --> 00:54.186
SF Support Group, front and rear.

00:55.335 --> 00:56.812
And see,

00:57.676 --> 00:59.532
you're not the only hot
chick on this mission.

01:00.115 --> 01:02.099
You're the only massive twat.

01:03.651 --> 01:06.236
She's been posted in to
Special Reconnaissance Regiment.

01:06.306 --> 01:08.307
Private Maisie Richards.

01:08.336 --> 01:11.587
Deployed with us because she topmarked
on her advanced driving course.

01:11.593 --> 01:15.019
She's driving us... middle
vehicle with full medical kitout.

01:15.947 --> 01:17.143
Fully kitted?

01:17.167 --> 01:19.699
So they clearly need us
to keep this target alive.

01:21.742 --> 01:24.105
Well, I hope she's as good
as they say she is, then.

01:24.225 --> 01:25.652
Me too.

01:45.424 --> 01:47.511
Shake a leg, Doris!

01:47.631 --> 01:49.603
Ain't you heard? There's a war on.

01:49.981 --> 01:53.641
Hello, all stations, this is
Zero Alpha. Prepare to move.

01:58.456 --> 02:01.070
Right, listen in... target not a child.

02:01.150 --> 02:04.476
Politician. AKA "Mighty Oak".

02:05.090 --> 02:06.812
Is he government or rebel?

02:06.932 --> 02:07.920
Does it matter?

02:07.943 --> 02:10.987
We dunno who the good
guys are no more, boss?

02:37.669 --> 02:39.335
Get your lids on, fellas.

02:44.013 --> 02:45.615
Georgie.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.689
They tell me we had your helmet
specially made, didn't we, Peanut?

02:50.713 --> 02:52.196
Biggest head in the Army.

02:52.316 --> 02:54.076
We've all gotta have
something we can be proud of.

02:54.081 --> 02:56.801
Boss... target building
hundred metres on the right.

02:58.552 --> 03:00.956
Abort mission,
repeat, abort mission!

03:00.986 --> 03:02.678
Return to RV point.

03:04.534 --> 03:06.973
Hello, support groups one
and two, this is Zero Alpha.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.865
Turn vehicles around now, over.

03:08.866 --> 03:11.052
Drone activity picking up RPG movement.

03:11.093 --> 03:12.704
Route no longer secure.

03:12.727 --> 03:14.624
Abort! Abort!

03:15.441 --> 03:18.208
- Boss...?
- He said abort. So abort!

03:18.328 --> 03:20.396
I can see the target buildings there...

03:20.426 --> 03:22.888
- I can get us back safe.
- How?

03:22.917 --> 03:25.225
We can't just leave our
target in there to die.

03:25.226 --> 03:26.585
Boss.

03:29.214 --> 03:32.588
Zero Alpha to support groups
one and two, move to ERV one.

03:32.623 --> 03:34.193
We'll only be a minute.

03:35.995 --> 03:38.685
Would you like to be transferred
to the support vehicle, medic?

03:40.046 --> 03:41.585
No.

03:41.831 --> 03:44.551
Prepare to move... Move!

04:18.137 --> 04:19.704
It's a bit too quiet.

04:20.589 --> 04:22.486
You want me to get Capital Radio on?

04:22.894 --> 04:25.496
Good luck to all our
listeners in Aleppo!

04:33.778 --> 04:35.035
Clear.

04:35.219 --> 04:36.520
Clear.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.035
Clear.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.345
Mighty Oak secured, extracting now.

05:07.399 --> 05:09.506
Let's get the hell out
of here, please, driver.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.725
- Stay sharp, everyone!
- Hello, sir, my name's Georgie.

05:12.726 --> 05:14.419
We're getting you to
a hospital in Cyprus.

05:14.437 --> 05:16.211
You're going to be all right!

05:16.269 --> 05:18.485
Prepare to medevac from RV point.

05:23.330 --> 05:25.198
Multiple injuries.

05:26.844 --> 05:28.475
Possible head injuries.

05:28.476 --> 05:30.555
Vital signs not good.

05:32.189 --> 05:33.718
Pulse faint.

05:34.127 --> 05:35.422
One CatA.

05:35.492 --> 05:38.678
Urgent medevac required.
Nineliner wait out.

05:44.345 --> 05:47.543
I'm losing him, Elvis. He's
arrested. Prepare defib.

05:49.994 --> 05:51.255
Prepare to shock.

05:51.296 --> 05:52.749
Clear! Shock!

05:52.784 --> 05:54.920
Sniper 100 yards, right.

05:59.261 --> 06:00.615
Yeah, I've got a pulse.

06:00.644 --> 06:02.518
Watch out for the RPG!

06:09.422 --> 06:11.822
What the hell are you playing at now?!

06:14.075 --> 06:16.435
Reverse and turn right, driver.

06:18.598 --> 06:20.325
Follow our orders, Richards.

06:20.722 --> 06:22.677
If I do that, we'll all be dead.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.134
- You seen something?
- Gut feeling.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.445
Why didn't you do what you were told?

06:30.503 --> 06:33.567
Just keep the vehicle steady, driver!

06:33.687 --> 06:36.567
And you just keep the
patient alive, medic!

06:37.536 --> 06:40.104
Richards, watch your mouth.

06:47.095 --> 06:48.869
Hold tight, guys.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.536
Why are we going this way?

06:51.656 --> 06:55.562
Surface cratered but open ground
to RV point will be quicker.

06:55.819 --> 06:58.673
Just like my missus
coming back from Morrisons.

06:59.671 --> 07:02.135
If we go over a IED
and get redmisted...

07:02.553 --> 07:04.485
He who dares...

07:25.745 --> 07:27.373
You could have got us all killed.

07:27.694 --> 07:29.859
- Yeah, but I never.
- Lucky.

07:30.203 --> 07:32.101
Better a lucky general than a good one.

07:32.130 --> 07:33.653
I can guarantee you'll never make

07:33.658 --> 07:36.963
anything other than private, Richards.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.178
Target should make Cyprus.

07:43.789 --> 07:44.798
Job done.

07:44.833 --> 07:46.567
Stabilised and back to the UK.

07:47.071 --> 07:48.430
You or him?

07:51.194 --> 07:52.940
- Georgie...
- What?

07:54.084 --> 07:55.354
Um...

07:59.938 --> 08:01.487
I just want you to know...

08:02.799 --> 08:03.883
Elvis...

08:04.092 --> 08:06.020
I just want YOU to know...

08:07.238 --> 08:08.970
I'm not interested in you.

08:09.514 --> 08:10.633
OK?

08:14.301 --> 08:17.228
I've got my career and
right now, that'll do for me.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.136
Yeah, well, I don't believe
that and neither do you.

08:21.794 --> 08:24.067
I'm using my brain, Elvis.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.573
Cos I've fucking got one.

08:55.919 --> 09:00.067
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

09:01.911 --> 09:03.470
Well, he's got a Mercedes...

09:03.493 --> 09:04.721
But noone's ever heard of him.

09:04.750 --> 09:07.943
Well, is he Lula's boyfriend or
is he like a friend who's a boy?

09:07.948 --> 09:09.541
We're not allowed to speak to him.

09:09.661 --> 09:11.181
We're shameful, apparently.

09:11.193 --> 09:12.850
Well, that is true, Mum.

09:13.089 --> 09:15.396
- Hiya, just two cappuccinos... yeah?
- Yeah.

09:15.415 --> 09:16.615
Please.Thanks.

09:16.634 --> 09:18.513
And two slices of that as well, please.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.934
It's her age. We all
go through that stage.

09:20.957 --> 09:23.554
- YOU didn't.
- Yeah... Because I was odd.

09:23.577 --> 09:25.714
You just wanted to be in the Army.

09:25.747 --> 09:27.624
- That made you more...
- Odd.

09:27.676 --> 09:29.954
In my own unique way.

09:30.756 --> 09:32.203
It's funny, that.

09:32.796 --> 09:34.360
Being Army makes you...

09:35.724 --> 09:38.348
I honestly... I don't even
know how to describe it.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.868
- I love you all equally but...
- Me the most.

09:42.959 --> 09:44.809
Get Lula down to Pirbright.

09:44.861 --> 09:48.182
Basic training will sort her out.

09:49.664 --> 09:51.094
Thanks. Yes, boss.

09:51.135 --> 09:52.553
Have you seen the news?

09:52.554 --> 09:55.355
Er... no. I'm out with my mum. Why?

09:55.384 --> 09:56.863
Take a look.

10:00.835 --> 10:03.035
- Are you talking about this earthquake?
- Yes,

10:03.216 --> 10:05.691
emergency relief team
just being assembled.

10:06.374 --> 10:07.914
You busy?

10:08.661 --> 10:10.010
I'm ready, boss.

10:27.143 --> 10:28.903
Corporal Lane.

10:29.174 --> 10:31.443
Still can't get used to the two tapes.

10:31.952 --> 10:33.249
It's well deserved.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.617
Thank you, boss.

10:35.849 --> 10:37.329
Couple of new recruits.

10:37.449 --> 10:39.025
- Yep.
- Both extraordinary...

10:39.081 --> 10:42.162
valuable assets to the regiment but...

10:42.512 --> 10:43.978
There's always a but with you, boss.

10:44.006 --> 10:45.785
- One might need your mentoring.
- Go on.

10:45.818 --> 10:49.114
Great soldier, could progress all
the way. But tends to be more...

10:49.310 --> 10:51.881
- maverick than the Army accepts.
- OK.

10:51.896 --> 10:52.952
Top squaddie.

10:53.031 --> 10:55.389
I don't want to see all that
raw talent squandered, so...

10:56.201 --> 10:58.433
with your hand on the shoulder...

10:58.461 --> 11:00.172
What am I, Mother Hen now?

11:00.695 --> 11:02.843
Look, I know you care about
the welfare of the guys.

11:02.876 --> 11:05.701
A holistic approach, if you will,
rather than barking orders...

11:07.508 --> 11:08.714
who, the Asian lad?

11:09.603 --> 11:10.629
No.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.394
Her.

11:17.619 --> 11:19.949
Private Maisie Richards.

11:22.272 --> 11:23.400
You can handle her.

12:02.728 --> 12:05.562
- So what's Colchester like, then, Richards?
- Shit hole.

12:05.588 --> 12:07.601
Yeah? I quite liked it
when I was stationed there.

12:07.635 --> 12:09.303
Yeah, you didn't have
to grow up there, though.

12:09.327 --> 12:10.367
True.

12:10.395 --> 12:12.382
- Were your parents in the forces?
- Yeah.

12:12.502 --> 12:13.562
Parcelforce.

12:13.805 --> 12:15.647
- You trying to be funny, Richards?
- No,

12:15.904 --> 12:17.480
my dad was a postie.

12:17.501 --> 12:18.851
Till he killed a dog.

12:19.191 --> 12:20.691
And do we want to know about this?

12:20.882 --> 12:21.962
I do!

12:21.980 --> 12:24.207
Always carried a dog knife
with him on his rounds,

12:24.215 --> 12:25.780
then one day... bosh.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.793
He reckoned it was him or the dog.

12:28.233 --> 12:30.918
He became "Colchester's
most hated" on Facebook.

12:31.699 --> 12:33.667
Right, let's crack on, shall we?

12:33.742 --> 12:34.802
Indeed.

12:34.877 --> 12:35.911
Come on, Brains...

12:36.031 --> 12:38.294
How come everyone's asking
Maisie about Colchester

12:38.305 --> 12:40.296
and noone's seen fit
to ask me about Leeds?

12:40.707 --> 12:41.928
Everyday sexism!

12:42.234 --> 12:43.742
Right, guys, listen in for a moment.

12:44.373 --> 12:46.999
This is Major Thapa
from the Nepalese Army.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.340
Good day, men. Ladies.

12:49.818 --> 12:51.898
We're going to be heading a couple
of hundred kilometres from here,

12:51.917 --> 12:53.699
nearer the epicentre of the earthquake,

12:54.266 --> 12:57.437
where sections of this country were
reduced to rubble in 90 seconds.

12:58.020 --> 12:59.469
We're heading into the mountains

12:59.480 --> 13:01.504
where a medical facility
has been established.

13:01.624 --> 13:04.141
We'll be working closely
with the Nepalese Army

13:04.190 --> 13:06.188
and the NGOs on the ground there.

13:06.606 --> 13:08.989
There'll be injuries and bodies.

13:09.303 --> 13:11.771
We'll be dealing with those
to stop the spread of disease.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.927
Thousands have been affected
and it comes frighteningly soon

13:14.931 --> 13:17.410
after the massive earthquake of 2015.

13:17.411 --> 13:18.771
It's going to be tricky out there.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.678
I need you all on your mettle.

13:20.973 --> 13:22.720
- Is that understood?
- Sir.

13:23.879 --> 13:24.879
Carry on, Kingy.

13:24.994 --> 13:27.116
Right, guys, on with the task in hand.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.352
Did you hear about the
earthquake in Leeds?

13:29.472 --> 13:32.273
Caused a million pounds'
worth of improvements.

13:33.456 --> 13:34.771
Right, on me, Richards.

13:35.033 --> 13:36.676
Peak for you, mate...

13:39.474 --> 13:41.058
Did you hear what Captain James said?

13:41.379 --> 13:43.933
We need you on your mettle and
not making flippant remarks.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.155
Is this about Syria?

13:46.974 --> 13:48.662
Are you still sore about that?

13:49.163 --> 13:52.091
I have been charged with
mentoring you on this mission.

13:52.169 --> 13:54.497
- I heard.
- Right, so let's cut the attitude

13:54.848 --> 13:56.644
and start to focus on helping people

13:56.651 --> 13:58.818
in their desperate plight, understood?

13:59.751 --> 14:01.082
Attitude, Corporal?

14:01.202 --> 14:04.869
Starting with making insensitive
jokes about earthquakes.

14:06.356 --> 14:07.973
You screw up in this,

14:08.093 --> 14:09.986
it's going to reflect badly on me...

14:10.761 --> 14:12.190
And that ain't happening.

14:13.373 --> 14:14.412
Got it?

14:15.641 --> 14:17.145
Right, back to Sergeant King.

14:17.870 --> 14:18.966
Now.

14:19.861 --> 14:20.947
Move!

15:09.509 --> 15:11.750
Seems like whole villages have gone.

15:20.556 --> 15:22.833
Looks like we're going
to be busy, boss man.

15:33.472 --> 15:34.738
Right, guys, listen in.

15:34.761 --> 15:37.463
We're alighting here and
completing our journey on foot.

15:37.491 --> 15:40.748
The roads are impassable so we'll
be carrying all our supplies.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.364
- Understood?
- Sir.

16:04.016 --> 16:05.921
So what religion are
they round here, then?

16:05.947 --> 16:08.364
What you asking him
for? Just cos he's brown?

16:08.484 --> 16:12.089
- Um, what am I, then?
- Shades, mate, shades.

16:12.258 --> 16:14.318
- Christians, aren't they?
- Hindu.

16:14.353 --> 16:17.306
Massive majority. 10% Buddhist...

16:18.473 --> 16:20.965
Did none of you throbbers think
to Google where we were going?

16:21.449 --> 16:23.430
It's also 5% Muslim.

16:23.690 --> 16:25.692
Needed to know my brothers
had a presence here.

16:25.727 --> 16:27.320
- Hey, Monk.
- Trust me!

16:27.355 --> 16:29.774
I did a project on Mount
Everest in Year Seven.

16:29.783 --> 16:31.379
Day off, I'll be up that, mate.

16:31.435 --> 16:34.395
- Day off you'd be up anything.
- If you play your cards right, sugar tits.

16:34.619 --> 16:39.113
- Oi, any Methodists, Rab?
- No, mate, you've all been wiped out.

16:44.934 --> 16:49.384
Aw! It is a proper
nasty smell around here.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.886
That'll be the corpses.

17:21.484 --> 17:24.141
Guys, make sure you
hold on to your supplies.

17:27.006 --> 17:28.506
Soon. Soon.

17:33.981 --> 17:35.258
Namaste.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.020
Guys, wait out here.

17:37.242 --> 17:40.220
Major Thapa. Who's our point of contact?

17:40.221 --> 17:41.921
I'll show you. This way.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.590
Guys, on me.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.000
Right, guys, be careful here.

17:55.029 --> 17:57.043
Don't let the villagers take anything.

17:58.714 --> 18:02.502
Guys, keep hold of your supplies
until we work out who needs what.

18:02.759 --> 18:05.087
- Rab, keep hold of your supplies.
- Let's get organised

18:05.105 --> 18:07.439
before you start handing out water.

18:07.559 --> 18:10.603
British Army being billeted
in the large tent over there.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.027
Captain James.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.731
- You are...?
- Milan Dhakal,

18:13.801 --> 18:16.051
from the NGO Nepal Disaster Relief.

18:16.171 --> 18:18.096
Did you bring medical
supplies as requested?

18:18.119 --> 18:20.343
- Lane...
- Have you got refrigeration?

18:20.570 --> 18:22.355
Some of the inoculations
need to be kept cold.

18:22.379 --> 18:24.708
No power. Sourcing a new generator.

18:26.418 --> 18:27.546
You going to let me help, then?

18:27.570 --> 18:29.391
- It's not heavy.
- So I can take it.

18:29.835 --> 18:31.581
So can I . Thank you.

18:32.954 --> 18:34.924
Right, guys, medical
supplies taken in here...

18:34.948 --> 18:37.077
Rest of it, let's get
back to our quarters.

18:37.357 --> 18:38.552
You the medic?

18:38.907 --> 18:39.940
Yeah.

18:40.415 --> 18:42.610
Treating the walking
wounded as best we can,

18:42.931 --> 18:44.761
hoping to get those
with significant injuries

18:44.775 --> 18:46.143
airlifted to the hospital.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.767
- Any doctors?
- One.

18:49.206 --> 18:50.817
Arrived a couple of hours ago.

18:51.489 --> 18:53.119
She'll be delighted to see you.

18:53.753 --> 18:56.265
People still coming in
from outlying villages.

18:56.932 --> 18:58.422
How are they being transported?

18:58.655 --> 18:59.934
By wheelbarrow...

19:01.428 --> 19:02.507
mainly.

19:03.202 --> 19:05.051
The road in is impassable.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.880
Hence the wait for the generator.

19:16.293 --> 19:18.591
Major Thapa tasking my
guys on body disposal

19:18.594 --> 19:20.466
before they crack on digging latrines.

19:20.771 --> 19:24.150
- Risk of infection is...
- Bodies, water, power, shelter, food.

19:24.270 --> 19:25.761
All desperate.

19:26.414 --> 19:28.761
And do we have sufficient
shelter for the displaced?

19:29.225 --> 19:31.723
Some. And we're the lucky ones.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.997
Other areas have zero help.

19:36.486 --> 19:39.050
We saw him trying to get down
the mountain pass, went to help.

19:42.270 --> 19:45.300
Richards, press this on the
wound for me. Stop the bleed.

19:45.332 --> 19:46.672
That's it.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.250
No... not too hard. Yeah. Perfect.

19:50.397 --> 19:53.745
Hi, sir, my name's Georgie
and you're gonna be OK.

19:53.806 --> 19:55.944
Can you tell me your name?

19:55.995 --> 19:57.750
Do you speak English, fella?

19:59.351 --> 20:00.670
Doctor!

20:00.790 --> 20:02.480
I can't right now.

20:03.133 --> 20:05.804
Rab, go and get that
NGO in here a second.

20:05.879 --> 20:08.582
- We need someone to translate for us.
- Which one was that?

20:08.611 --> 20:11.161
The handsome dude who
speaks perfect English.

20:20.901 --> 20:23.473
I need to turn him on his
side to check for lacerations.

20:23.501 --> 20:26.001
On three. One, two, three.

20:26.036 --> 20:28.166
That's it, thank you.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.906
Spinal trauma, possible punctured lung.

20:31.941 --> 20:33.622
We need to get him to a real hospital.

20:33.675 --> 20:36.067
He's in good hands. I can see that.

20:36.571 --> 20:38.197
Yeah, and so are you.

20:39.131 --> 20:40.870
Do what you're told on this mission

20:40.891 --> 20:42.486
and I'll make a soldier of you yet.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.253
Hi.

20:46.373 --> 20:47.990
I need to know what's happened to him.

20:56.826 --> 20:58.174
Fell from a roof.

20:58.401 --> 21:01.530
OK, I'll give him some pain relief,
but he needs a lot more than that.

21:01.985 --> 21:03.274
You from here?

21:03.829 --> 21:05.141
Kathmandu.

21:05.905 --> 21:07.132
What are you?

21:07.494 --> 21:09.705
- Like, the mayor or something?
- Yes.

21:11.194 --> 21:12.658
No.

21:13.108 --> 21:15.699
Engineer. Posted here as
soon as the quake struck.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.494
You need some help?

21:29.011 --> 21:30.552
There you go.

21:35.448 --> 21:36.767
He's nice.

21:36.797 --> 21:37.958
Who?

21:39.475 --> 21:41.040
What?

21:41.489 --> 21:43.526
Look at it like a holiday romance.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.559
I'm not on holiday,
Richards. Neither are you.

21:48.429 --> 21:50.162
He's nice, though.

21:51.225 --> 21:52.859
Yeah, he seems nice.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.414
I knew you knew who I was talking about.

22:01.391 --> 22:03.783
Going to build a funeral
pyre for your nan, Fingers?

22:03.795 --> 22:06.076
Why would I do that? She's not dead.

22:06.129 --> 22:09.110
Be prepared. You can start
building it in the garden.

22:09.230 --> 22:11.671
She lives in a third floor flat, mate.

22:11.992 --> 22:14.746
- My nan wants a green burial.
- What is one of them?

22:14.764 --> 22:16.665
Buried in a Plymouth
Argyle kit, or something?

22:16.666 --> 22:19.210
Cardboard box, left in the
woods, as far as I can make out.

22:19.496 --> 22:21.025
Once you're gone, you're gone.

22:21.145 --> 22:23.404
Why would you give a monkeys what
happens to you when you're dead?

22:23.405 --> 22:26.628
Dignity?

22:27.245 --> 22:29.038
Why would you laugh about that?

22:54.499 --> 22:56.544
I need you to confirm all deceased.

22:58.596 --> 23:00.131
Yes, boss.

23:06.790 --> 23:09.235
Maybe you can kindly ask
them to shut the fuck up

23:09.258 --> 23:11.709
- while I crack on.
- Get off! Get away from me now.

23:13.220 --> 23:16.232
Guys, some respect, please.

23:32.713 --> 23:35.454
Guys, keep hydrated,
it's very important.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.427
Maisie, on this, please. Cheers.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.215
- You heading back to the medical facility?
- Yeah.

23:49.842 --> 23:51.444
Any luck with the generator?

23:51.564 --> 23:53.924
Still waiting on the
diggers to clear the road.

23:56.925 --> 23:59.124
17.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.982
Children in the orphanage.

24:01.195 --> 24:03.235
Tara's my little helper.

24:03.778 --> 24:05.133
17?

24:05.253 --> 24:06.626
Are these new orphans?

24:06.746 --> 24:09.042
Many killed in the outlying villages.

24:09.958 --> 24:11.990
Your guys dealing with it.

24:12.532 --> 24:14.414
So they come to this village for...

24:14.415 --> 24:16.898
- They know this is where the help is.
- Yeah.

24:19.273 --> 24:22.646
Tara lost her family in the 2015 quake.

24:23.323 --> 24:25.453
I sponsor some of the kids,

24:25.681 --> 24:27.093
including Tara.

24:28.335 --> 24:30.095
That's really kind of you.

24:30.558 --> 24:31.982
I have everything,

24:32.102 --> 24:33.523
they had nothing.

24:35.275 --> 24:36.604
You know the Queen?

24:38.121 --> 24:41.143
Yeah! Yeah, she knocks
on for me all the time.

24:41.943 --> 24:43.944
You speak very good English.

24:44.236 --> 24:46.343
I speak Chinese, too.

24:46.612 --> 24:48.859
- Yeah?
- Ni hao.

24:49.460 --> 24:51.114
Very good.

24:54.228 --> 24:55.833
Where are the kids staying?

24:56.095 --> 24:57.263
Tents.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.640
Tara?

25:04.995 --> 25:06.611
There's got to be more we can do.

25:06.681 --> 25:08.397
And can I sponsor them, too?

25:08.415 --> 25:10.032
You're already helping.

25:10.152 --> 25:12.632
- That's why you're here.
- Yeah, but who's looking after them?

25:12.663 --> 25:14.618
- We all do what we can.
- Are they being fed?

25:14.630 --> 25:17.041
Are they, you know...

25:18.657 --> 25:20.372
We all do what we can.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.151
We're looking for a building
we can rehouse them in

25:25.180 --> 25:27.212
on a temporary basis
but most of the buildings

25:27.229 --> 25:29.447
are either fully occupied or dangerous.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.003
Did you study in Nepal?

25:32.213 --> 25:34.022
I went to school in Kathmandu.

25:34.711 --> 25:36.957
But I went to university
in Mumbai and New York.

25:36.975 --> 25:38.778
OK.

25:38.898 --> 25:40.738
So that's why you speak
better English than me.

25:42.455 --> 25:44.134
What's your funny little accent?

25:44.135 --> 25:45.841
I haven't got an accent.

25:47.014 --> 25:48.525
It's Manchester.

26:02.677 --> 26:05.163
Don't they get their
drinking water from this river?

26:05.193 --> 26:06.774
No, further up.

26:07.229 --> 26:09.097
Think I'll stick to San Pellegrino.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.115
So what about the poor
fuckers further down?

26:11.133 --> 26:13.104
Their stomachs must become immune.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.796
It's a weird old world,
that's what I say.

26:16.114 --> 26:18.748
Yeah, it'll be even weirder
if you don't crack on.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.307
Come on. Sarge.

26:27.959 --> 26:29.668
Swear to me you
don't like football, Rab?

26:29.715 --> 26:31.265
Honestly, hate it.

26:31.311 --> 26:33.608
Love my phys, but football?

26:33.728 --> 26:35.514
Crap sport played by thick tossers.

26:35.515 --> 26:37.355
You can't watch badminton
all day long, though.

26:37.571 --> 26:39.130
I don't watch it, I play it.

26:39.332 --> 26:40.961
I would smash you at badders.

26:41.195 --> 26:43.295
You talk the talk, but can
you hack it with the racket?

26:43.319 --> 26:46.275
Whoa. He used to play for
West Ham. Be careful, Rab.

26:46.648 --> 26:49.347
- Juniors.
- More than you'll ever do, Fingers.

26:49.977 --> 26:52.438
Oi! Put them down, please.

26:52.558 --> 26:54.305
She's just tying to help, Kingy.

26:54.492 --> 26:57.386
She earns bits of money from
helping around the place.

26:59.145 --> 27:00.245
You all right?

27:00.257 --> 27:01.481
I'm helping.

27:01.601 --> 27:02.806
Thank you.

27:07.305 --> 27:09.297
In your own time, Maisie.

27:09.530 --> 27:10.973
Chill out, Kingy.

27:11.295 --> 27:12.784
It's good to encourage her.

27:17.210 --> 27:18.994
She's a sweetheart.

27:20.011 --> 27:21.257
Hi, Tara.

27:21.832 --> 27:24.292
I need you to find all the
other kids for a health check.

27:24.334 --> 27:25.684
A very quick health check.

27:26.002 --> 27:27.099
You understand?

27:29.336 --> 27:31.922
I need a couple of
volunteers. Do you mind?

27:32.042 --> 27:33.299
No, go for it.

27:33.831 --> 27:35.703
Richards, Kalil.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.310
On me, please.

27:49.863 --> 27:50.936
What's your name?

27:54.765 --> 27:56.442
- Nimissa.
- Nimissa.

27:59.504 --> 28:00.545
How old?

28:06.134 --> 28:08.950
Whatever we're paying
you, Tara, it's not enough.

28:09.818 --> 28:12.919
- So you speak Nepali, English...
- And Hindi.

28:12.961 --> 28:15.061
And Chinese.

28:15.232 --> 28:18.865
Ni hao. Ni hao ma. Jin tian hen mei.

28:18.926 --> 28:20.383
That was Chinese.

28:20.392 --> 28:22.203
- Shut up!
- What do you speak, Rab?

28:22.323 --> 28:23.481
English.

28:23.482 --> 28:25.374
Don't get clever, or
you'll get a bitch slap.

28:25.533 --> 28:26.854
Focus, Richards.

28:27.265 --> 28:29.151
All the children need to be photographed

28:29.370 --> 28:31.807
and each name attached to
the photo for reference.

28:31.858 --> 28:33.613
Tara, you help me with the names, yeah?

28:37.554 --> 28:39.525
- Come on, Maisie.
- What?

28:39.683 --> 28:41.892
Don't just give one kid all the sweets.

28:41.939 --> 28:43.727
She'll share 'em round.

28:43.998 --> 28:45.582
They love sweets.

28:46.221 --> 28:48.000
Don't just bribe her to like you.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.582
She'll like you if you do your job.

28:49.802 --> 28:52.398
Have you ever actually met any children?

28:53.145 --> 28:55.522
You give 'em cabbage,
I'll give 'em sweets.

28:55.549 --> 28:56.707
Get on, Richards.

28:56.827 --> 28:58.361
Now. Next.

28:58.555 --> 28:59.666
Thank you.

29:06.936 --> 29:10.087
Tara, ask this lad if he's ever
had any problem with his ears,

29:10.111 --> 29:12.001
and if he's been examined by a doctor.

29:15.868 --> 29:17.768
So you must know a bit of Indian?

29:17.838 --> 29:19.043
I'm Pakistani.

29:19.271 --> 29:20.933
Schoolboy error.

29:21.578 --> 29:24.266
Punjabi. And I don't speak it brilliant,

29:24.332 --> 29:26.540
much to the shame of my grandparents.

29:26.660 --> 29:28.674
OK, and does he get a lot of earaches?

29:32.376 --> 29:33.471
OK.

29:35.154 --> 29:36.868
Well, tell him we'll get him checked.

29:40.333 --> 29:42.807
Thank you, Tara. You're a good girl.

29:46.417 --> 29:49.147
Richards, come here, please.

29:49.692 --> 29:52.062
Right. Look into this lad's ear.

29:52.794 --> 29:55.735
Significant signs of an
ear infection. Can you see?

29:55.810 --> 29:57.761
Yeah, I think so.

29:57.881 --> 29:59.806
Right, when you're examining children,

30:00.362 --> 30:02.215
always check the eyes are clear.

30:02.458 --> 30:03.770
Look at my finger.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.033
And always check the
ears and the throat.

30:07.602 --> 30:08.663
If you do notice something

30:08.677 --> 30:11.007
that doesn't look normal
or healthy, refer them.

30:13.046 --> 30:14.270
Here you go.

30:14.322 --> 30:16.572
It's really important that
you concentrate, Maisie.

30:17.305 --> 30:18.901
There's actual lives at stake.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.404
OK, next one.

30:28.392 --> 30:30.493
Get down!

30:34.677 --> 30:37.532
We had 4,000 aftershocks in 2015.

30:37.852 --> 30:39.906
You better get used
to them, Captain James.

30:41.091 --> 30:42.811
You OK?

30:46.115 --> 30:48.053
What the hell was that?

30:49.091 --> 30:51.753
- Did the earth just move for you guys?
- Aftershock.

30:51.873 --> 30:53.339
Apparently, there's
nothing to worry about.

30:53.363 --> 30:55.791
Erm, says the guy who
just shat his combats.

30:55.792 --> 30:57.082
All right, guys,

30:57.122 --> 30:59.961
grab your gear, head back and
get scrubbed up as best you can.

30:59.962 --> 31:01.219
Sarge.

31:01.709 --> 31:03.822
Whoa! That was mental.

31:03.852 --> 31:06.552
You shat yourself, mate.
What are you talking about?

31:06.672 --> 31:08.562
We've sent up some temp showers.

31:08.846 --> 31:11.320
What, bucket of water
type temp showers, Kingy?

31:11.489 --> 31:14.599
Not that luxurious, I'm
afraid, but soap and water.

31:14.652 --> 31:18.416
Very important, guys. I'm
not mucking about, trust me.

31:25.793 --> 31:28.421
You can't go in there,
Tara. It's dangerous.

31:28.422 --> 31:30.630
- But I heard a cry.
- What?

31:30.700 --> 31:32.096
You heard a cry?

31:46.597 --> 31:49.763
Wait there, Tara. OK? Promise me.

31:51.215 --> 31:53.170
Maisie, don't be mad. Get back here.

31:53.290 --> 31:55.519
We heard someone crying.

31:55.548 --> 31:57.095
I'll call it in, boys.

31:57.126 --> 31:59.244
- There's just been an aftershock, it's dangerous.
- Hello, Zero Alpha,

31:59.268 --> 32:01.731
- this is Alpha 40.
- There's a tiny gap, I can get through.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.333
No, just wait for the cavalry.

32:03.342 --> 32:05.453
I'm just going to
investigate. Fucking hell.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.072
We need to get the
building propped first.

32:07.096 --> 32:09.893
If it was you down there, Rab,
you'd want someone to pull you out,

32:09.911 --> 32:12.880
rather than waiting six hours
for health and safety bollocks.

32:13.142 --> 32:15.149
No, no, tell her to wait! Mais...

32:35.496 --> 32:38.409
- Fingers, look at this.
- My God!

32:39.823 --> 32:42.923
Great... now, she's saving goats.

32:45.347 --> 32:47.081
Wonder how she's going
to top this tomorrow.

32:47.391 --> 32:49.345
You're not taking that home,
Richards. Is that understood?

32:49.369 --> 32:51.724
Well, what if I get it
a pet passport, boss?

32:52.002 --> 32:53.530
Can you get Monk one
while you're at it, boss?

32:53.553 --> 32:54.711
What you saying, bruv?

32:55.719 --> 32:57.914
Maybe you should have
waited, as instructed.

32:58.231 --> 33:00.808
Look, I heard a cry

33:01.378 --> 33:02.765
and I thought it was a baby,

33:02.807 --> 33:04.903
and I stuck my hand in
and I pulled this out.

33:05.519 --> 33:08.971
I'm sorry, Corporal. I wasn't being
defiant, I was just trying to...

33:11.257 --> 33:13.035
Look, I just thought,

33:13.259 --> 33:15.495
"What would Lane do in
these circumstances?"

33:16.602 --> 33:18.581
And I decided you'd save the baby.

33:19.599 --> 33:21.219
Yeah, sorry, my bad as well, boss.

33:21.228 --> 33:22.908
I called it in when
she was on her way out.

33:32.974 --> 33:35.775
You shouldn't mess around
in these unstable buildings.

33:37.052 --> 33:38.427
Right, guys...

33:38.866 --> 33:40.201
excitement over.

33:41.238 --> 33:42.722
Sort her out, Kingy.

33:48.404 --> 33:50.972
Lose the goat, Richards.

33:51.313 --> 33:53.629
Yeah, your family don't
exactly have a good track record

33:53.638 --> 33:55.436
when it comes to domestic animals.

33:55.556 --> 33:57.518
Mate, I love a curried goat.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.200
Should probably bring it back to
our quarters to cook it up, Kingy.

34:00.735 --> 34:02.266
Don't they eat cats round here?

34:02.508 --> 34:04.777
- That's China, isn't it?
- And that's dogs.

34:04.801 --> 34:07.061
We're nowhere near fucking China!

34:07.062 --> 34:08.755
That's on the other
side of the world, bro.

34:08.779 --> 34:10.085
- Wow.
- No, it ain't, pal.

34:10.119 --> 34:11.991
It's just the other side
of them there mountains.

34:12.009 --> 34:14.292
Yeah, right. Flippin'
China, I don't think so.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.536
Hey, India just there,

34:16.657 --> 34:17.980
China just there.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.612
I'll make him right.

34:20.627 --> 34:23.069
Wait, wait, wait. So we're, like, wedged

34:23.125 --> 34:24.773
between China and India?

34:25.612 --> 34:27.014
My favourite two takeaways.

34:28.431 --> 34:29.522
Correct.

34:29.554 --> 34:32.202
That's mental. I never
knew that. Did you, boss?

34:32.322 --> 34:34.793
You still chew your tongue
when you write your name, Monk.

34:35.339 --> 34:38.598
I'm guessing Geography GCSE
isn't a prerequisite at Pirbright.

34:38.717 --> 34:41.100
I'm surprised half of
them could find Pirbright.

34:41.851 --> 34:44.186
So how's it going with your mentee?

34:44.634 --> 34:47.925
Full of attitude and a gobby little
mare, just like my sister, but...

34:47.995 --> 34:49.089
We'll get there?

34:49.554 --> 34:51.735
If she doesn't kill us first.

34:51.791 --> 34:54.382
- Have you given it a name yet?
- Lose the goat, Richards.

34:54.420 --> 34:56.203
- You heard the boss.
- Pardon?

34:57.455 --> 34:59.014
Lose the goat.

35:09.780 --> 35:11.162
Good work today, guys.

35:11.204 --> 35:13.296
We'll sort some scoff and
then get some shuteye.

35:13.305 --> 35:14.739
Another busy day tomorrow.

35:14.897 --> 35:17.421
It's imperative we get the
power back up and running.

35:17.713 --> 35:20.724
In the meantime, we're awaiting
some emergency generators.

35:21.060 --> 35:22.204
Medic?

35:23.035 --> 35:25.481
Guys, personal hygiene is crucial.

35:25.482 --> 35:27.661
All right? There's a
massive risk of infection,

35:27.703 --> 35:29.146
so no one fuck up on this.

35:29.266 --> 35:31.658
You need to wash your hands
at all times before eating.

35:31.873 --> 35:33.902
- Understood, guys?
- Sarge.

35:34.022 --> 35:36.639
I could do without any of
you presenting in the sickbay.

35:37.494 --> 35:39.562
And I want the kit guarded at all times.

35:39.572 --> 35:41.906
If it's left lying
around, it will go walkies.

35:42.692 --> 35:43.955
Right, Fingers,

35:44.152 --> 35:45.207
on the rations.

35:50.522 --> 35:52.812
- There you go.
- Thanks a lot.

35:52.932 --> 35:54.600
- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

35:55.394 --> 35:56.570
Rab.

35:57.027 --> 35:58.152
Doris.

36:12.613 --> 36:14.392
Bloody aftershocks.

36:14.512 --> 36:17.241
I love the smell of
burning corpses in the morning.

36:17.512 --> 36:18.660
I mean,

36:18.740 --> 36:21.359
if they're happening all
the time, what's the point?

36:22.531 --> 36:23.951
What's the point of anything we do

36:23.974 --> 36:25.981
if it ain't going to be
standing by Christmas?

36:25.990 --> 36:28.352
Following orders, Richards,
and doing as you're told.

36:29.155 --> 36:30.635
And not abandoning hope.

36:31.676 --> 36:32.991
I get that, Rab.

36:33.833 --> 36:36.060
You bought a badminton set, then, Rab?

36:36.867 --> 36:39.031
Are you, like, seriously
good at it, Rab?

36:39.215 --> 36:41.457
Yeah, I thought that
was just the Japanese.

36:41.508 --> 36:44.557
Chinese, but, hell, let's not
be too culturally sensitive here.

36:44.677 --> 36:45.757
The Chinese are good at it?

36:45.797 --> 36:48.230
What about you nip across the border
and borrow us a couple of rackets?

36:48.254 --> 36:49.821
Will do.

36:49.822 --> 36:52.311
I'm sticking my money on Rab
for this one. Sorry, Monk.

36:52.708 --> 36:54.599
Right, guys, no time
for phys this morning.

36:54.632 --> 36:55.720
Crack on, get something to eat,

36:55.743 --> 36:57.787
and then we're disposing of
the rest of the bodies ASAP.

36:57.811 --> 36:59.137
Richards, Kalil,

36:59.165 --> 37:01.448
once you've eaten, I want
you to jog up to the top road

37:01.467 --> 37:03.638
and see how long they think
before it's accessible.

37:03.857 --> 37:06.321
The digger is on its
way, apparently. Boss.

37:06.322 --> 37:07.871
We need that generator.

37:07.872 --> 37:10.272
- The drugs are no good without it.
- Boss.

37:11.024 --> 37:12.411
Right, guys, let's get going.

37:31.613 --> 37:34.261
- Our generator!
- My generator.

37:34.577 --> 37:36.725
You're bringing it into the
village, yeah? For Milan?

37:36.730 --> 37:38.541
It will take too long
to clear this road.

37:38.661 --> 37:40.222
I can sell it to another village.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.761
No, we need this, matey.

37:41.763 --> 37:43.121
It ain't going anywhere.

37:43.337 --> 37:44.832
I haven't been paid.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.291
Well, don't worry about
that, you'll be paid.

37:47.382 --> 37:48.534
By you.

37:49.172 --> 37:52.801
Fella, I am looking you in the eye
and telling you, you'll be paid.

37:52.852 --> 37:54.056
End of.

37:54.562 --> 37:55.747
How much?

37:56.368 --> 37:58.091
How much did you agree on?

37:59.276 --> 38:01.472
I need $1,000 now.

38:02.919 --> 38:03.993
Sorted.

38:04.184 --> 38:05.333
You'll get 'em.

38:18.233 --> 38:19.367
But for that...

38:19.736 --> 38:21.548
I'm going to need the keys to your truck

38:21.566 --> 38:23.172
and drive the genny in myself.

38:24.042 --> 38:26.441
How you going to do that?
That's the only road in.

38:26.847 --> 38:28.591
Keys, and we got ourselves a deal.

38:41.908 --> 38:42.981
The fuck you doing, Mais?

38:42.982 --> 38:45.231
- What's the worst that could happen?
- We could die.

38:45.232 --> 38:47.551
- And get courtmartialled.
- You should have joined the Navy,

38:47.575 --> 38:49.564
you big wuss. Get in.

38:49.601 --> 38:51.331
Just don't do anything too nuts, Mais.

38:52.692 --> 38:55.171
Fucking hell, now she's
going all Resident Evil on me.

38:55.172 --> 38:57.912
I am getting you mentioned
in despatches, you melon.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.301
- The angle's way too steep.
- No, I reckon we could do this, Rab.

39:11.699 --> 39:14.571
- I don't like the "we" in that.
- I'm going to need you for ballast.

39:14.608 --> 39:15.645
Get in!

39:15.710 --> 39:17.232
Now!

39:22.694 --> 39:24.090
Come straight through.

39:26.252 --> 39:27.397
Boss?

39:28.270 --> 39:30.891
We really need to get these trauma
patients evacuated to hospital.

39:31.668 --> 39:34.115
In a perfect world...
which we don't live in.

39:34.932 --> 39:36.851
So do what you can, please, Lane.

39:48.617 --> 39:49.799
You're Indian, Rab...

39:49.841 --> 39:51.699
tell 'em to relax. I
know what I'm doing.

39:51.736 --> 39:54.607
- I'm Pakistani.
- Well, they'll understand you more than me.

40:10.082 --> 40:11.771
What the fuck did you say?

40:12.567 --> 40:14.261
SF drivers course.

40:21.601 --> 40:23.687
Have you ever done Nemesis
Inferno at Thorpe Park?

40:23.720 --> 40:25.233
Yeah, and I shat myself.

40:25.284 --> 40:27.402
Seriously, Rab, this is a piece of piss.

40:27.522 --> 40:29.021
You've just got to hold on tight.

40:29.141 --> 40:32.085
- If it was a piece of piss, then we...
- It's not going to topple at 45 degrees

40:32.109 --> 40:34.058
so long as we keep a bit of speed up.

40:36.012 --> 40:37.554
You ready?

40:37.963 --> 40:39.311
Nope.

40:40.110 --> 40:41.681
Good stuff.

40:47.586 --> 40:49.411
My head!

40:57.180 --> 40:59.724
- You OK?
- Yeah.

41:05.782 --> 41:07.702
Got the genny in!

41:09.201 --> 41:10.841
Smashed it!

41:12.812 --> 41:14.071
Yes!

41:14.191 --> 41:15.563
Come on!

41:21.632 --> 41:23.325
What happened to you?

41:23.354 --> 41:25.192
- Window licking.
- What?

41:25.245 --> 41:27.911
He banged his head, but
he never lost consciousness.

41:27.958 --> 41:29.119
Sit over there.

41:29.568 --> 41:32.031
Does it need
stitching? I hate needles.

41:32.032 --> 41:34.212
Get an infection in
that, and you could die.

41:34.232 --> 41:36.257
Anyway, a scar's going to look cool

41:36.285 --> 41:38.498
when you're getting your
Queen's award for gallantry.

41:41.072 --> 41:42.531
I'll tell you what she's done now...

41:42.532 --> 41:44.401
she's risked two lives
to get the generator in,

41:44.402 --> 41:46.907
instead of waiting ten
minutes for the digger.

41:47.027 --> 41:48.341
She's fucking annoying.

41:48.342 --> 41:50.662
"She's fucking annoying"
sums it up perfectly.

41:50.730 --> 41:51.977
You're her mentor.

41:52.383 --> 41:53.863
Sort her out, for fuck's sake.

41:59.307 --> 42:01.884
Goody twoshoes is
sticking her schnozz in.

42:05.540 --> 42:07.001
Got your genny in.

42:07.431 --> 42:09.663
Shut up and listen for once.

42:09.668 --> 42:11.059
Yes, you got the generator in,

42:11.078 --> 42:12.759
instead of waiting ten
minutes for a digger.

42:12.782 --> 42:14.631
Teamwork, Maisie. Discipline.

42:14.687 --> 42:16.876
Sharpen up or go home.

42:17.646 --> 42:19.668
I'm fed up with this
for a game of soldiers.

42:19.747 --> 42:20.868
What?

42:22.138 --> 42:25.672
I risk my arse getting the
muchneeded generator into the village,

42:25.709 --> 42:27.553
and I end up getting
a load of shit for it.

42:27.572 --> 42:30.021
Then leave and join the fucking circus.

42:39.567 --> 42:41.122
Have you sorted her out, Lane?

42:41.145 --> 42:43.116
Well, I tried, boss. Let's see.

42:43.135 --> 42:45.342
Hey, you, are you in charge?

42:45.417 --> 42:46.710
I need my money.

42:47.429 --> 42:48.605
I thought you Brits,

42:48.680 --> 42:51.066
- if you shook on a deal...
- Right, calm yourself, sir.

42:51.112 --> 42:53.904
- I will calm once I get money.
- What money?

42:54.319 --> 42:56.000
What deal have we shook on?

42:56.120 --> 42:59.516
- I knew it. I trusted that girl.
- What girl?

42:59.572 --> 43:01.650
The one driving my
truck into the village.

43:03.303 --> 43:06.697
- Give me my money or I will call police.
- Sir,

43:07.285 --> 43:10.801
calm down, and don't
poke your finger at me.

43:10.866 --> 43:13.690
She promised me money if I
let her bring the generator in.

43:13.709 --> 43:15.170
You've had your money.

43:24.639 --> 43:26.324
Your female soldier,

43:26.444 --> 43:29.042
- I want that money.
- You're not getting a penny more.

43:29.766 --> 43:30.911
Move.

43:52.102 --> 43:53.254
You all right, Mais?

43:53.932 --> 43:56.284
Keep out of the boss and medic's
way for a bit, if I were you.

43:56.308 --> 43:57.357
What?

43:57.477 --> 43:58.692
They're fuming

43:58.762 --> 44:00.792
that you offered a local
guy some extra money.

44:00.912 --> 44:03.021
Medic reckons it's going
to come out your wages.

44:03.287 --> 44:06.799
Sometimes, I'd like to knock her
perfect teeth down her throat.

44:07.546 --> 44:09.121
They are perfect, aren't they?

44:19.054 --> 44:22.070
Have you updated your profile pic
yet, Rab? Show off your war wounds?

44:22.102 --> 44:24.320
Soon as I get internet, mate... bosh.

44:24.362 --> 44:25.687
What are you going to say happened?

44:25.711 --> 44:27.906
The truth, I was attacked by a tiger.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.769
They don't have tigers round here.

44:31.664 --> 44:34.158
Do they?

44:39.848 --> 44:41.511
My father used to say

44:42.013 --> 44:43.658
you could stand on the mountain,

44:44.242 --> 44:46.157
raise your arms

44:46.851 --> 44:48.591
and touch the sky.

44:50.002 --> 44:53.049
OK, well, I would like to try that, but

44:53.061 --> 44:56.112
I'm a bit busy. Supper for the children.

44:57.968 --> 44:59.722
Come and help me hand out the rations.

45:00.227 --> 45:01.476
Yeah?

45:11.562 --> 45:14.231
Don't you ever feel like
starting somewhere else?

45:14.915 --> 45:17.675
I mean, there must be
easier places than...?

45:17.795 --> 45:19.268
Yes.

45:20.557 --> 45:23.891
Mind you, I feel like that half
the time, and I'm from Manchester.

45:26.364 --> 45:28.832
But I guess our problems
are tiny compared to...

45:28.856 --> 45:31.360
- First World problems.
- Exactly.

45:32.376 --> 45:36.023
We have to have armed
guards on humanitarian aid.

45:36.216 --> 45:38.536
Well, you can't leave your
knickers on the line in Salford.

45:40.447 --> 45:42.513
I could go and be an engineer in

45:42.633 --> 45:45.279
America, or Canada, or Sweden...

45:45.997 --> 45:48.180
but I want to stay and help.

45:48.770 --> 45:50.322
It's your country.

45:50.442 --> 45:52.563
And I want to help rebuild it.

45:54.834 --> 45:58.749
But, then, what if it
happens all over again?

45:59.522 --> 46:01.358
Then, we rebuild again.

46:02.344 --> 46:04.690
I just... I don't know
how you survive here.

46:05.139 --> 46:07.666
We see another world on our phones.

46:07.701 --> 46:09.871
And, of course, people
want to go live an easier,

46:09.941 --> 46:13.280
- more comfortable life.
- A better life.

46:13.350 --> 46:15.451
But what is a better life?

46:17.038 --> 46:19.828
We have agents here in Nepal.

46:20.774 --> 46:25.005
They find jobs for people
in Dubai, or Hong Kong, or...

46:28.996 --> 46:32.337
There are no jobs for
people in Dubai or Hong Kong.

46:33.717 --> 46:35.584
Not for our destitute.

46:36.436 --> 46:38.968
These poor people are trafficked to...

46:39.308 --> 46:40.901
God knows where...

46:41.338 --> 46:44.350
Syria, Bangladesh, India...

46:45.033 --> 46:46.830
and exploited.

46:47.338 --> 46:51.382
Basically, they're sold into
slavery looking for this better life.

46:53.320 --> 46:55.582
- It's fucked up, innit?
- Yeah.

46:55.702 --> 46:58.727
So we have to unfuck it.

47:07.358 --> 47:08.681
Tara,

47:09.483 --> 47:12.467
- what did Da Chand want?
- Nothing.

47:16.118 --> 47:17.997
Tara...

47:18.559 --> 47:20.107
thank you.

47:45.724 --> 47:48.255
Right, tell her we're going to give...

47:50.248 --> 47:51.946
Tell her we're going
to give her something

47:51.968 --> 47:54.061
to make her feel more comfortable. Yeah?

48:03.030 --> 48:06.128
She says she can't see. Blind.

48:06.157 --> 48:08.129
OK. Well, we'll get an eye expert

48:08.148 --> 48:10.177
to check if there's
any permanent damage.

48:10.608 --> 48:13.727
But in the meantime, I'm going
to flush her eye out with water.

48:32.651 --> 48:34.037
Has it started to clear?

48:35.167 --> 48:37.091
Can't fault your timing.

48:37.535 --> 48:38.870
She can see your light.

48:39.454 --> 48:40.789
That's got to be a good sign.

48:41.764 --> 48:43.851
Now, I need you to use your influence

48:43.874 --> 48:46.367
to arrange for an eye
specialist to come and visit.

48:46.577 --> 48:48.034
I'll see what I can do.

48:48.860 --> 48:49.927
Thanks.

48:50.597 --> 48:52.474
I'm going to have to go
and access some more diesel

48:52.492 --> 48:53.688
- for the generator.
- Good.

48:53.716 --> 48:56.356
I could do without the fridge going
off in the middle of the night.

48:57.091 --> 48:58.617
Richards?

48:58.986 --> 49:00.415
- Back later.
- Here.

49:01.698 --> 49:03.254
You rang, m'lud?

49:05.686 --> 49:08.081
Richards, escort Tara
back with the other kids.

49:08.244 --> 49:10.564
Milan needs to go and source
some diesel for the generator.

49:11.583 --> 49:12.847
Here to serve.

49:14.068 --> 49:15.947
Shall we cut the attitude, Richards?

49:19.403 --> 49:20.587
Come on then, scamp.

49:23.745 --> 49:25.757
If you give me five
minutes, I'll come with you.

49:26.228 --> 49:27.847
It's the bottom village.

49:28.157 --> 49:30.007
A steep climb back up the hill.

49:30.571 --> 49:32.368
I'm an Army girl, I'll survive.

49:32.812 --> 49:34.450
I was thinking of me.

49:35.006 --> 49:36.892
Then, I'll put you in a wheelbarrow and

49:37.116 --> 49:38.526
push you back up the hill.

49:44.694 --> 49:46.930
What you going to be when
you grow up, then, Tara?

49:47.140 --> 49:48.937
Married, children.

49:49.838 --> 49:52.177
You, right, could do anything...

49:52.500 --> 49:54.427
absolutely anything with your life.

49:54.547 --> 49:56.234
Now, I've watched you survive here.

49:56.258 --> 49:59.539
If you can survive here,
you'd piss any job in the UK.

50:00.062 --> 50:01.294
What do you mean?

50:01.481 --> 50:03.247
Seriously, you could do anything.

50:03.578 --> 50:04.998
I'm not mucking around here.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.555
You're brighter, smarter
than anyone I've ever met.

50:08.828 --> 50:11.027
No one could do what you do daytoday.

50:11.028 --> 50:12.437
You're a bloomin' miracle.

50:12.438 --> 50:14.759
You set your mind to
anything, you'd smash it.

50:14.783 --> 50:16.963
Be a lawyer, politician.

50:17.083 --> 50:18.494
Prime Minister, even.

50:18.614 --> 50:19.936
In UK?

50:20.949 --> 50:23.652
And you wouldn't have to take
orders from some Doris like me...

50:23.671 --> 50:25.467
you'd be the one giving the orders.

50:25.468 --> 50:28.274
So when they say you got to get married,

50:28.394 --> 50:30.248
tell them you've got bigger fish to fry.

50:30.598 --> 50:32.547
You're going to conquer the world.

50:33.858 --> 50:36.028
There's a great big world out there

50:36.043 --> 50:38.120
just waiting for Tara
to take it by storm.

50:38.367 --> 50:39.450
Understood?

50:39.478 --> 50:40.650
Yes.

50:47.128 --> 50:49.195
Two more doctors
arriving in the morning.

50:49.315 --> 50:51.623
Might allow you a moment or two to rest.

50:52.692 --> 50:54.487
Everything all right, Richards?

50:54.488 --> 50:57.015
So what happened to the diesel?

51:05.638 --> 51:07.701
You need to get back to your
quarters and get your head down.

51:07.725 --> 51:10.471
You going off on a moonlight
walk with Mr LoverLover?

51:10.546 --> 51:12.717
Move, Richards, now.

51:14.109 --> 51:16.172
Some fucking mentor.

51:16.485 --> 51:18.824
Let's pretend I never
heard that, Richards.

51:21.682 --> 51:25.206
- Some fucking deaf mentor.
- I suggest you double away

51:25.234 --> 51:27.092
before you get yourself
into serious bother.

51:29.118 --> 51:31.047
- Sure.
- One more word,

51:31.266 --> 51:33.567
and you'll be packing your
kit and you'll be sent home.

51:49.798 --> 51:53.008
- You OK?
- Yeah, it's just that girl. She drives me insane.

51:53.541 --> 51:55.473
She's always got to cross the line.

51:56.132 --> 51:58.403
Sometimes it's good to
cross the line, you know?

52:05.960 --> 52:08.948
We have a plan to rebuild
every devastated area.

52:09.496 --> 52:13.120
Quakeresilient schools
and hospitals and homes.

52:13.838 --> 52:15.838
We just need two things...

52:16.212 --> 52:17.869
time and money.

52:18.658 --> 52:20.918
"The God who made the mouth
will provide the food."

52:22.048 --> 52:23.537
Do you believe in God?

52:26.474 --> 52:27.945
Do you have a faith?

52:28.738 --> 52:30.844
I have an absolute faith and belief

52:30.868 --> 52:33.785
that what we are doing
is right and for the best.

52:35.844 --> 52:37.660
That's why I joined the Army.

52:40.667 --> 52:41.731
I know.

52:42.207 --> 52:43.477
How mad is that?

53:10.489 --> 53:12.867
There's quite a lot of
rudeness in your religion.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.690
Everywhere I go, I've got...

53:16.222 --> 53:18.968
willies pointing at me.

53:33.168 --> 53:35.021
Will you stay in the Army?

53:36.269 --> 53:37.859
Erm...

53:38.669 --> 53:41.842
I do wonder what life
would be like outside.

53:42.638 --> 53:45.327
I think about it all the
time, but I never quite...

53:45.864 --> 53:47.662
I never quite make the jump.

53:48.135 --> 53:50.265
We all think about other lives.

53:50.866 --> 53:52.395
Paths not taken.

53:54.408 --> 53:55.600
Yeah.

53:56.563 --> 53:58.297
Have you ever been married?

54:02.363 --> 54:03.967
Nearly.

54:22.254 --> 54:23.817
Touching is forbidden.

54:24.196 --> 54:25.859
I keep forgetting.

54:49.373 --> 54:51.077
This was Tara's house.

54:54.480 --> 54:56.091
Really?

54:56.424 --> 54:58.874
Not been touched since the 2015 quake.

55:01.868 --> 55:03.933
We could go inside and take a look?

55:05.323 --> 55:06.730
A quick one?

55:39.134 --> 55:40.598
What's all that about?

55:43.392 --> 55:45.829
- What's that?
- I think it's an aftershock.

55:46.611 --> 55:48.983
Drop, cover, hold on!

55:50.795 --> 55:53.572
Whoa!

55:54.214 --> 55:55.947
Me hand!

55:58.935 --> 56:00.653
Guys, is everyone OK?

56:00.654 --> 56:02.606
What the fuck's going on, boss?

56:02.811 --> 56:04.363
It might be another earthquake.

56:04.649 --> 56:06.131
Is everyone here?

56:06.934 --> 56:09.933
Get down!

56:39.374 --> 56:40.827
Milan?

56:45.357 --> 56:46.873
Milan?

56:54.514 --> 56:56.249
Milan?!

56:57.334 --> 56:58.897
I can't find the medic, boss.

56:58.933 --> 57:02.011
- Who last had eyes on Lane?
- I thought she'd be back, boss.

57:11.655 --> 57:13.238
You all right, boss?

57:13.253 --> 57:15.077
I prefer an enemy you can see.

57:15.135 --> 57:17.483
I could shag you whenever I wanted to.

57:17.603 --> 57:18.911
So you saying you want to?
