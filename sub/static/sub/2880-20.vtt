WEBVTT

00:02.443 --> 00:04.582
I got to tell you, the more
I read about the primordial

00:04.583 --> 00:07.584
gravity wave discovery,
the more excited I get.

00:07.586 --> 00:09.719
I know. Being an
astrophysicist right now

00:09.721 --> 00:11.221
is like being a rock star.

00:11.223 --> 00:13.423
Only without the sex.

00:13.425 --> 00:16.392
Yeah, literally, none of it.

00:17.228 --> 00:19.462
What do you think
about it, Sheldon?

00:19.464 --> 00:21.097
Meh.

00:21.099 --> 00:23.032
Are you kidding me?

00:23.034 --> 00:25.301
This may be the biggest
scientific breakthrough

00:25.303 --> 00:27.070
of our lifetime. How can you,

00:27.072 --> 00:28.905
as a theoretical
physicist,

00:28.907 --> 00:30.206
not care about this?

00:30.208 --> 00:32.142
Maybe it's because
I'm not an elitist.

00:32.144 --> 00:33.376
What I'd like to know is:

00:33.378 --> 00:35.245
How does this gravity wave
breakthrough

00:35.247 --> 00:36.813
help the man on the street?

00:36.815 --> 00:38.281
You know?
Wh-Who's looking out

00:38.283 --> 00:41.885
for Joe Six-Pack and all
his quantum physics concerns?

00:41.887 --> 00:44.687
Oh, my God,
you're jealous.

00:44.689 --> 00:46.756
Why would I be jealous?

00:46.758 --> 00:49.125
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because
the origin of the universe

00:49.127 --> 00:50.360
just got proven,

00:50.362 --> 00:52.028
the Higgs field
just got proven

00:52.030 --> 00:53.429
and you've been working
on string theory

00:53.431 --> 01:01.304
for the last 20 years and
you're no closer to proving it

01:01.306 --> 01:04.206
We happen to live
in a golden age of television.

01:05.309 --> 01:06.476
Excuse me,
fellas.

01:07.813 --> 01:09.779
Sorry for eavesdropping,
but there actually was

01:09.781 --> 01:11.381
some big string theory news
today

01:11.383 --> 01:12.916
out of the Hadron Collider.

01:12.918 --> 01:15.785
Really? Did they find evidence
to support extra dimensions

01:15.787 --> 01:17.287
or supersymmetry?

01:17.289 --> 01:20.290
No, but they did find evidence
that you'll believe anything.

01:22.359 --> 01:24.661
Why would you do that?

01:24.663 --> 01:26.663
You're a string theorist
as well.

01:26.665 --> 01:29.399
Incorrect.
I am a string pragmatist.

01:29.401 --> 01:32.035
I say I'm gonna prove something
that cannot be proved,

01:32.037 --> 01:33.469
I apply for grant money,

01:33.471 --> 01:36.072
and then I spend it
on liquor and broads.

01:37.007 --> 01:38.875
Later.

01:40.778 --> 01:43.012
Do you think he's right?

01:43.014 --> 01:47.483
Am I wasting my life on a theory
that can never be proven?

01:49.720 --> 01:53.857
Maybe. But how great

02:24.380 --> 02:26.381
Hey, you're up early.

02:26.383 --> 02:28.650
I couldn't sleep.

02:28.652 --> 02:32.720
I told you those <i>Walking Dead</i>
pillowcases were a bad idea.

02:32.722 --> 02:34.789
No, that's not it.

02:34.791 --> 02:36.391
Is something bothering you?

02:36.393 --> 02:39.327
Yes, but you wouldn't
understand.

02:39.329 --> 02:41.696
Oh, come on, try me.

02:42.564 --> 02:44.365
All right.

02:45.501 --> 02:49.170
I've devoted the prime
of my life to string theory

02:49.172 --> 02:51.205
and its quest
for the compactification

02:51.207 --> 02:52.840
of extra dimensions.

02:52.842 --> 02:56.611
I've got nothing to show for it,
and I feel like a fool.

02:57.479 --> 02:59.080
Okay. I get it.

02:59.082 --> 03:01.849
I mean, not all the jibberjabber
in the middle, but...

03:02.851 --> 03:04.218
I know what it's like

03:04.220 --> 03:05.787
to put your heart and soul
into something

03:05.789 --> 03:07.322
and get nothing out of it.

03:07.324 --> 03:09.657
You mean your acting career?

03:10.492 --> 03:12.393
No.

03:12.395 --> 03:14.462
Your relationship with Leonard?

03:15.297 --> 03:16.931
No.

03:16.933 --> 03:18.566
Your failed attempt
to go back to college?

03:18.568 --> 03:20.068
No!

03:20.070 --> 03:21.135
I'm saying you

03:21.137 --> 03:22.770
and string theory sound
like a relationship,

03:22.772 --> 03:24.872
and I know what it's like
to be in one

03:24.874 --> 03:27.342
and realize it's never gonna
turn out the way you want.

03:28.277 --> 03:30.478
I said Leonard; you said no.

03:31.347 --> 03:33.548
I'm talking about other guys.

03:33.550 --> 03:34.916
Okay.

03:34.918 --> 03:37.518
Well, what do you do?

03:37.520 --> 03:39.854
You have to have the courage
to end the relationship.

03:39.856 --> 03:43.091
You know? Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

03:44.828 --> 03:47.095
I don't know if I can do that.

03:47.097 --> 03:48.629
I know it's hard, honey,
but in the end,

03:48.631 --> 03:49.664
that's how you grow.

03:54.370 --> 03:57.105
Penny, have you seen
my good inhaler?

03:59.208 --> 04:02.176
Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

04:06.915 --> 04:09.784
Hey, how's dating
two women going?

04:09.786 --> 04:11.786
Um, kind of hit a bump.

04:11.788 --> 04:14.889
When I was honest and told Emily
she wasn't the only person

04:14.891 --> 04:16.224
I was seeing, it went great.

04:16.226 --> 04:18.392
So I tried the same thing
with Lucy.

04:18.394 --> 04:19.627
And?

04:19.629 --> 04:22.597
She had mixed feelings.

04:22.599 --> 04:24.999
But when I said,
"Emily was cool with it.

04:25.001 --> 04:27.402
Emily's the best. Why can't you
be more like Emily?"...

04:29.238 --> 04:32.740
...those feelings
became less mixed.

04:33.942 --> 04:37.645
Women. Who knows
what'll set 'em off?

04:37.647 --> 04:41.582
At least now I can focus all
my energies on just one girl.

04:41.584 --> 04:43.584
I hope I get to meet her
as soon as possible.

04:43.586 --> 04:45.286
Why the rush?
She isn't going anywhere.

04:45.288 --> 04:47.922
She is. But I like
that attitude.

04:49.591 --> 04:53.461
Gentlemen, is anybody interested
in my old string theory books?

04:53.463 --> 04:55.196
You're really
going to do this?

04:55.198 --> 04:58.733
I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out
that what I'm going through

04:58.735 --> 04:59.934
is essentially a breakup.

04:59.936 --> 05:02.703
And according
to <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine,

05:02.705 --> 05:05.339
one of the most effective
techniques for moving on

05:05.341 --> 05:08.376
is to get rid of all reminders
of the relationship.

05:08.378 --> 05:10.378
You're reading <i>Cosmo?</i>
Yes.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.914
as it turns out,
there's an article,

05:12.916 --> 05:15.983
on how to get over a breakup
in literally every issue.

05:16.819 --> 05:18.219
Anyway,

05:18.221 --> 05:20.354
it suggests that I
set these on fire,

05:20.356 --> 05:22.457
but the smell of burning books

05:22.459 --> 05:25.660
reminds me of church picnics
in East Texas.

05:27.162 --> 05:29.163
What's this?
Oh,

05:29.165 --> 05:32.934
that's just a doodle of
a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.

05:32.936 --> 05:36.137
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis
of your postdoc fellowship?

05:36.139 --> 05:37.371
It was.

05:37.373 --> 05:39.474
This seemed so elegant
at the time,

05:39.476 --> 05:40.641
but...

05:40.643 --> 05:43.344
now I realize I was just
a simple country boy

05:43.346 --> 05:45.847
seduced by a big city theory

05:45.849 --> 05:48.683
with variables
in all the right places.

05:50.152 --> 05:52.453
It's going to be okay.
I know.

05:52.455 --> 05:54.689
As hard as this is,
I have to move on.

05:54.691 --> 05:57.525
I can't keep postulating
multidimensional entities

05:57.527 --> 05:59.327
and get nothing in return.

05:59.329 --> 06:01.095
I have needs, too.

06:07.070 --> 06:08.769
So, you and Emily
still together?

06:16.045 --> 06:18.479
I spoke to Bernadette.
She's free tomorrow night.

06:18.481 --> 06:19.914
Oh, okay, great.

06:19.916 --> 06:22.183
But if we're really gonna do
a double date,

06:22.185 --> 06:24.619
then we have to go over
some ground rules about Emily.

06:24.621 --> 06:26.921
Like when it turns out
she's made of rubber,

06:26.923 --> 06:28.556
I don't say anything?

06:30.092 --> 06:32.026
She's very real.

06:32.028 --> 06:34.529
Oh, that's what it says
on the box.

06:35.697 --> 06:38.666
Right next to "dishwasher safe."

06:39.501 --> 06:40.501
See?

06:40.503 --> 06:41.836
This is exactly
the kind of thing

06:41.838 --> 06:43.571
I'm worried about you
saying in front of her.

06:43.573 --> 06:45.840
I promise I'll be
on my best behavior.

06:45.842 --> 06:49.377
You better be. No jokes about
how close I am with my dog.

06:49.379 --> 06:53.214
Or the truth about how close
I am with my dog.

06:53.216 --> 06:54.615
You got it.

06:54.617 --> 06:56.684
No jokes about the
year I took ballet.

06:56.686 --> 06:58.386
You took ballet?

06:59.221 --> 07:01.389
God, you never listen.

07:04.192 --> 07:06.360
Are you sure you
want to do this?

07:06.362 --> 07:08.829
The magazine articles suggest
that one of the ways

07:08.831 --> 07:11.432
to get over a breakup
is a new look.

07:11.434 --> 07:12.867
Mmm. What about your old look,

07:12.869 --> 07:15.603
well-groomed ventriloquist doll?

07:17.205 --> 07:20.441
"Oh, my God, I do look like that."
Stop it!

07:21.877 --> 07:25.046
So, how do you want me to cut it?
Oh,

07:25.048 --> 07:29.450
how about Bill Gates
meets Nikola Tesla?

07:30.252 --> 07:31.719
So, business in the front,

07:31.721 --> 07:33.621
science in the back.

07:33.623 --> 07:35.222
Or I don't cut it

07:35.224 --> 07:36.891
and maybe just style it
a little.

07:36.893 --> 07:38.559
Oh, I'm in
your hands.

07:38.561 --> 07:41.929
Do a good job and I'll tell you
<i>Cosmo's</i> ten dynamite tips

07:41.931 --> 07:44.265
to enjoy your PMS.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.267
Can you keep him quiet?

07:46.269 --> 07:47.835
Maybe jangle some keys
in front of him?

07:47.837 --> 07:49.036
That doesn't
work anymore.

07:49.038 --> 07:51.806
He just thinks I'm taking him
to the doctor.

07:53.008 --> 07:54.976
So, now that you're
no longer invested

07:54.978 --> 07:57.612
in string theory,
what are you gonna pursue?

07:57.614 --> 07:59.614
Oh, there are so
many exciting areas:

07:59.616 --> 08:02.650
black holes, dark matter...
Oh,

08:02.652 --> 08:04.118
Leonard was telling me
about dark matter,

08:04.120 --> 08:05.686
but I didn't
really understand it.

08:05.688 --> 08:08.756
Don't feel bad.
Neither does he.

08:12.127 --> 08:14.161
Okay...

08:14.163 --> 08:16.330
what do you think?

08:18.600 --> 08:21.268
Have you ever even seen
a picture of Tesla?

08:22.037 --> 08:23.804
It actually
looks good, Sheldon.

08:23.806 --> 08:26.007
Doesn't it?
Yeah.

08:26.009 --> 08:31.112
I suppose I could see myself
in a scientific boy band.

08:31.114 --> 08:33.514
Of course, I'd be the dreamy one
and the smart one.

08:35.385 --> 08:36.951
Sorry I'm late.

08:37.719 --> 08:39.453
What did you do?

08:39.455 --> 08:41.722
I gave him a new look.
It's cute, huh?

08:41.724 --> 08:44.525
Yeah, it's cute.
That's the problem.

08:44.527 --> 08:46.827
I don't need other girls
to see him walking around

08:46.829 --> 08:48.963
like sex on a stick.

08:50.499 --> 08:53.634
She's right.
I'm too hot.

08:58.273 --> 08:59.874
I'm excited
to meet Emily.

08:59.876 --> 09:02.810
Me, too. I just hope
he doesn't blow it.

09:02.812 --> 09:04.745
Why would you
say that?

09:04.747 --> 09:08.516
Because he's Raj--
that's his thing.

09:08.518 --> 09:11.719
Beckham can bend it, Ralph
can wreck it, Raj can blow it.

09:13.055 --> 09:15.089
Look, I don't want it
to happen,

09:15.091 --> 09:17.825
but odds are he's gonna
find a way to...

09:18.660 --> 09:20.661
Oh, crap,
I know that girl.

09:20.663 --> 09:21.696
How?

09:21.698 --> 09:24.131
In a bad way, very bad.

09:24.133 --> 09:25.399
Hey, guys.

09:25.401 --> 09:27.001
Whatever you hear tonight,
just remember I love you.

09:27.003 --> 09:28.402
Hey!

09:36.788 --> 09:39.890
Emily, these are my good
friends, Howard and Bernadette.

09:39.892 --> 09:41.992
Guys, this is Emily.
Nice to meet you.

09:41.994 --> 09:43.193
Hi.
Hello.

09:43.195 --> 09:45.228
Have we met before?

09:45.997 --> 09:49.332
Uh... no.

09:49.334 --> 09:50.133
I-I don't...

09:50.135 --> 09:51.868
I don't... think so.

09:51.870 --> 09:53.503
You sure? You look familiar.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.839
Well, you sure don't.

09:55.841 --> 09:57.741
You I know,
you I know, you?

09:57.743 --> 10:00.710
Total stranger.

10:00.712 --> 10:04.915
Even if you had yummy candy,
I would not get in your van.

10:04.917 --> 10:07.951
Did you go to that spin class
on Green Street?

10:07.953 --> 10:09.786
That must be it.

10:09.788 --> 10:12.122
Since when do you go
to spin class?

10:12.124 --> 10:14.457
Wow. Now who doesn't listen?

10:16.994 --> 10:18.495
Sheldon,
your food's getting cold.

10:18.497 --> 10:20.697
What are you doing?
Oh, looking through

10:20.699 --> 10:23.967
my textbooks
for a new field of inquiry.

10:23.969 --> 10:26.970
Why do we have a geology book?

10:26.972 --> 10:29.306
Leonard, did you throw

10:29.308 --> 10:31.808
a children's party
while I was in Texas?

10:32.910 --> 10:34.678
Wait. What's wrong with geology?

10:34.680 --> 10:37.213
Let me put this in a way
you'll understand, Penny.

10:37.215 --> 10:39.082
You remember
how you explained to me

10:39.084 --> 10:41.518
that the Kardashians
aren't real celebrities?

10:41.520 --> 10:43.153
Well, geology

10:43.155 --> 10:45.488
is the Kardashians of science.

10:46.490 --> 10:48.091
Have you considered

10:48.093 --> 10:50.260
studying standard model physics?

10:50.262 --> 10:52.262
You want me
to give up string theory

10:52.264 --> 10:53.830
for something
that's less advanced?

10:53.832 --> 10:55.999
You know, why don't you break up
with Penny

10:56.001 --> 10:58.201
and start dating a brown bear?

10:59.470 --> 11:02.706
Like you could
get a brown bear.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.174
Hey, I've got a good job.

11:04.176 --> 11:06.376
I could buy salmon.
You don't know.

11:07.645 --> 11:09.612
Maybe you could make
your new field of study

11:09.614 --> 11:11.514
the calculation
of nuclear matrix elements.

11:11.516 --> 11:13.016
Oh, please.

11:13.018 --> 11:16.653
If I wanted to take up a fad,
I'd get a tramp stamp.

11:19.757 --> 11:21.891
What about loop quantum gravity?

11:21.893 --> 11:24.194
Oh, Duchess, look at me.

11:24.196 --> 11:27.030
My quantum gravity's
positively loopy.

11:28.432 --> 11:30.166
Who's the duchess?

11:30.168 --> 11:33.336
One of the people
that lives in his head.

11:33.338 --> 11:36.272
I hope he's this distraught
if he ever breaks up with me.

11:36.274 --> 11:39.042
Well, if he does, I'll see
if my bear has a friend.

11:41.278 --> 11:42.479
Sheldon, have you
ever considered

11:42.481 --> 11:43.546
not rushing into something new?

11:43.548 --> 11:45.181
I mean, why don't you
take your time,

11:45.183 --> 11:46.783
enjoy your freedom?

11:46.785 --> 11:50.186
Maybe something new
to study will find you.

11:51.288 --> 11:53.189
That's actually not bad advice.

11:53.191 --> 11:55.358
You know, I didn't seek out
string theory.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.961
It just hit me
over the head one day.

11:57.963 --> 11:59.662
How does that happen?

11:59.664 --> 12:01.765
A bully chased me through
the school library

12:01.767 --> 12:05.101
and hit me over the head with
the biggest book he could find.

12:06.837 --> 12:08.838
Okay, how about we toast
your newfound freedom?

12:08.840 --> 12:12.409
Ah, normally
I refrain from alcohol,

12:12.411 --> 12:15.678
but since my cerebral cortex is
twiddling its proverbial thumbs,

12:15.680 --> 12:17.480
why not soak it in grape juice

12:17.482 --> 12:19.949
that's been predigested
by a fungus?

12:21.152 --> 12:24.020
And you wonder why other
children beat you with books.

12:24.022 --> 12:25.522
Cheers!

12:28.059 --> 12:30.160
Emily, what
do you do?

12:30.162 --> 12:32.729
I'm a dermatology resident
at Huntington Hospital.

12:32.731 --> 12:34.597
Mmm, and you know
what that means.

12:34.599 --> 12:38.435
Someone's skin's about
to be softer than ever.

12:39.403 --> 12:40.837
This is making
me crazy.

12:40.839 --> 12:42.672
I know I know you
from somewhere.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.607
Oh, uh, Howard
was an astronaut.

12:44.609 --> 12:46.609
Maybe that's where you saw him.
Wow!

12:46.611 --> 12:48.078
That's amazing.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.379
What was that like?

12:49.381 --> 12:52.382
It was the most incredible
experience of my life.

12:52.384 --> 12:55.318
Up there
in the space station, you're...

12:55.320 --> 12:57.454
Oh, my God, I remember.

12:57.456 --> 13:00.490
Can I finish my astronaut story?

13:00.492 --> 13:01.991
It was four years ago.

13:01.993 --> 13:04.127
Please don't say it.
We were set up on a blind date.

13:04.129 --> 13:05.862
Please don't say it.
You came to my apartment.

13:05.864 --> 13:07.997
You're saying it.

13:07.999 --> 13:09.666
Well, wh-what happened?

13:09.668 --> 13:11.501
Yeah, what happened?
Okay, I'll say it.

13:12.704 --> 13:16.072
I was on the way to pick her up.

13:16.074 --> 13:18.274
My stomach felt a little funny.

13:18.276 --> 13:21.644
When I got there, I asked
if I could use her bathroom.

13:21.646 --> 13:23.646
Please don't say it.

13:26.117 --> 13:28.685
One roll of toilet paper
and 20 minutes later,

13:28.687 --> 13:31.020
I was so humiliated,

13:31.022 --> 13:34.023
I snuck out the window
and never saw her again.

13:34.025 --> 13:35.992
You know what else
I never saw again--

13:35.994 --> 13:37.994
my security deposit.

13:37.996 --> 13:39.596
I'm sorry.

13:39.598 --> 13:42.765
I tried to unclog it,
but you didn't have a plunger,

13:42.767 --> 13:44.434
and water was
spilling out everywhere.

13:44.436 --> 13:46.369
Right, just water.

13:48.105 --> 13:50.540
Look, I have felt terrible
about this for years,

13:50.542 --> 13:52.275
and I'm glad
I have the opportunity

13:52.277 --> 13:54.911
to tell you
just how sorry I am.

13:54.913 --> 13:56.279
It's fine.

13:56.947 --> 13:58.548
All my friends love this story.

13:58.550 --> 14:00.783
They call you Clogzilla.

14:00.785 --> 14:02.652
Get it?

14:02.654 --> 14:04.254
Because you clogged up
her bathroom

14:04.256 --> 14:05.822
like a radioactive monster!

14:07.125 --> 14:08.525
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

14:08.527 --> 14:09.692
Howie.

14:09.694 --> 14:11.161
Well, hey, it's not like
cotton candy

14:11.163 --> 14:12.529
comes out of you.

14:15.266 --> 14:16.633
Come on, let's
get you to bed.

14:16.635 --> 14:17.834
You've had a lot
to drink.

14:17.836 --> 14:19.302
No more than Penny.

14:19.304 --> 14:21.304
That's what I'm saying.

14:21.306 --> 14:23.573
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.609
Empty room.

14:26.611 --> 14:28.278
Empty room.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.914
Empty room.

14:30.916 --> 14:33.316
If somebody says "Come in,"
I'm gonna freak out.

14:38.489 --> 14:40.023
So, Emily, why did you

14:40.025 --> 14:41.858
decide to specialize
in dermatology?

14:41.860 --> 14:43.960
I like cutting
people with knives,

14:43.962 --> 14:47.997
and all the other jobs where
you get to do that are illegal.

14:48.866 --> 14:50.266
You're kidding, right?

14:54.805 --> 14:56.539
She's scary,
but it's a cute scary.

14:57.709 --> 14:59.976
Can I say just one more thing?

14:59.978 --> 15:02.946
I had some kind
of food poisoning that day.

15:02.948 --> 15:05.748
Sure, in retrospect,
gas station sushi--

15:05.750 --> 15:07.217
maybe not the best choice.

15:07.219 --> 15:09.118
Nor was climbing out

15:09.120 --> 15:10.186
your window and running away.

15:10.188 --> 15:11.654
But I think
we can all understand

15:11.656 --> 15:13.089
how humiliating that was,
and I'd really

15:13.091 --> 15:14.524
appreciate it
if we could move on.

15:14.526 --> 15:16.559
Howie, we moved on
a long time ago.

15:16.561 --> 15:18.962
I'm just saying...
We moved on.

15:20.364 --> 15:23.299
Okay. Fine.

15:25.703 --> 15:26.903
How's your soup?

15:26.905 --> 15:28.104
Ah, it's all right.

15:28.106 --> 15:30.106
They could've filled
the bowl a little more.

15:34.078 --> 15:35.478
Excuse me.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.813
Where are you going?

15:36.815 --> 15:38.081
I need some fresh air.

15:38.083 --> 15:39.949
Been there.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.074

16:00.671 --> 16:02.905
Oh, no.

16:02.907 --> 16:05.108
What have I done?

16:28.832 --> 16:30.600
How you feeling?

16:31.435 --> 16:33.336
Not so good.

16:35.105 --> 16:38.374
Are you gonna introduce me
to your friend?

16:39.476 --> 16:41.177
It's not my friend.

16:41.179 --> 16:43.379
Nothing happened.

16:43.381 --> 16:44.514
I don't know.

16:44.516 --> 16:48.117
I heard you reading pretty loud
last night.

16:48.952 --> 16:50.920
Oh, dear Lord.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.922
Where's Amy?

16:52.924 --> 16:55.058
After she put you to bed,
she went home.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.893
Oh.

16:56.895 --> 17:00.163
I should call her and apologize.

17:00.165 --> 17:02.365
Oh.

17:02.367 --> 17:05.300
Oh, no.
What?

17:05.303 --> 17:09.339
Apparently, I called
Stephen Hawking last night.

17:09.340 --> 17:11.641
First new message.

17:11.643 --> 17:14.676
Hawkman!

17:14.679 --> 17:18.314
It's your old buddy
Sheldonoscopy!

17:19.983 --> 17:22.417
How come you didn't
pick up the phone?!

17:22.420 --> 17:24.686
Oh, right. My bad.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.095
You're awful quiet.
Everything okay?

17:32.930 --> 17:34.630
Not really.

17:34.632 --> 17:37.834
I had a bit
of an embarrassing evening.

17:37.836 --> 17:40.403
Ugh. Me, too.
What happened?

17:40.405 --> 17:42.171
I drank alcohol

17:42.173 --> 17:47.310
and may have left an unfortunate
voice mail for Stephen Hawking.

17:47.312 --> 17:49.712
I wouldn't worry about it.

17:49.714 --> 17:51.881
He's got a pretty good
sense of humor.

17:51.883 --> 17:54.650
Oh, I hope so.

17:54.652 --> 17:56.886
What happened to you
last night?

17:56.888 --> 17:58.888
Oh, well, turns out

17:58.890 --> 18:01.591
I'd already met the girl
Raj is seeing

18:01.593 --> 18:04.927
when I did a number
on her bathroom.

18:08.298 --> 18:10.500
And that number was two.

18:12.836 --> 18:15.872
Well, you know,
I've always been a fan

18:15.874 --> 18:18.875
of a story told
by Attar of Nishapur,

18:18.877 --> 18:20.009
about a king

18:20.011 --> 18:22.979
who assembled a group
of wise men

18:22.981 --> 18:26.749
to create a ring that would
make him happy when he was sad.

18:26.751 --> 18:28.551
And that ring

18:28.553 --> 18:32.622
was inscribed with the phrase,
"This too shall pass."

18:34.224 --> 18:36.659
Hey, Cooper!
Oh, my God.

18:36.661 --> 18:40.263
I heard you drunk-dialed
Stephen Hawking last night?

18:40.265 --> 18:42.331
Classic!

18:42.333 --> 18:43.433
Get out of here, Barry.

18:43.435 --> 18:45.435
Whatever you say...

18:45.437 --> 18:47.637
Clogzilla.

18:51.208 --> 18:53.342
Clogzilla. That's pretty funny.

18:54.578 --> 18:57.814
I don't think
that's gonna pass.

19:06.224 --> 19:08.192
Next message.

19:08.194 --> 19:10.027
It's me again!

19:10.029 --> 19:12.429
I gave up string theory.

19:12.431 --> 19:14.298
You should give up black holes,

19:14.300 --> 19:17.100
and we can totally
solve crimes together!

19:18.703 --> 19:20.504
Next message.

19:20.506 --> 19:22.039
Do you know what's great?!

19:22.041 --> 19:25.476
Geology. Oh!

19:25.478 --> 19:28.378
Look at this geode!

19:28.380 --> 19:30.714
That's fun to say!

19:30.716 --> 19:35.018
Gee... ode! Gee... ode!

19:35.020 --> 19:36.854
Next message.

19:36.856 --> 19:39.456
Gee... ode!

19:39.458 --> 19:41.959
Gee... ode!

19:41.961 --> 19:44.194
I kiss girls now.

19:45.897 --> 19:47.764
Next message.

19:47.766 --> 19:49.466
Hey, guess who I am!

19:49.468 --> 19:50.834
Beep bop boop bop!

19:50.836 --> 19:53.170
I'm you! Get it?!

19:54.372 --> 19:56.240
Next message.

19:56.242 --> 19:58.475
Are you mad at me?

19:59.344 --> 20:02.412
Oh, no, you're mad at me.

20:02.414 --> 20:04.648
I'm so sorry!

20:04.650 --> 20:07.017
Beep bop boop bop.

20:07.785 --> 20:09.319
Next message.

20:09.321 --> 20:14.324
Thiospinel sulfide.
Thiospinel sulfide.

20:14.326 --> 20:17.794
That's even more fun
than "gee... ode."

20:18.846 --> 20:21.213
Hey, did you see
<i>The Lego Movie?</i>

20:24.605 --> 20:26.138
What a jackass.
