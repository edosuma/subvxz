WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:04.656
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends, we last left
our Jane facing rejection.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.616
I'm sorry. It's just,
it's too late.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.052
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But while Jane's love life
was sinking,

00:09.096 --> 00:11.228
her career was on the rise.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.926
I'm a published freaking author!

00:13.970 --> 00:15.972
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And she just started working
with her father.

00:16.016 --> 00:19.062
What if our young lead's story
is in present day

00:19.106 --> 00:21.064
and you and River
are living in the future?

00:21.108 --> 00:22.631
In outer space.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.938
We can call it
This Is Mars.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.940
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking
of crazy plot twists,

00:27.984 --> 00:29.159
someone was out to get J.R.

00:29.203 --> 00:32.597
Get down! Gun!What? What?!

00:32.641 --> 00:35.774
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But it turns out that trouble
was a little closer to home.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.646
Oh, my God. It was my daughters?LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But Petra and J.R.

00:37.689 --> 00:38.951
decided to work through it.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.867
Let me show the girls
I am not a bad guy.

00:41.911 --> 00:44.261
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also giving things
another shot,

00:44.305 --> 00:45.828
Jorge and Alba.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.309
I know. Straight out
of a telenovela, right?

00:48.352 --> 00:50.963
So let's get back to ours.

00:51.007 --> 00:53.053
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

00:53.096 --> 00:56.099
was 11 years, nine months
and two weeks old,

00:56.143 --> 00:57.883
she was determined to win

00:57.927 --> 01:00.451
a statewide
essay writing contest.

01:00.495 --> 01:03.628
You see, she wanted
the recognition, the glory,

01:03.672 --> 01:05.500
and to get her picture
in the newspaper.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.850
And, well, she got it all.

01:07.893 --> 01:10.331
We are so proud
of you, Janie.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.159
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But it turns out,

01:12.202 --> 01:14.987
that wasn't all Jane wanted.

01:15.031 --> 01:17.990
Why did you throw
the paper out?

01:18.034 --> 01:20.080
I didn't even care
about the contest.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.559
What?

01:21.603 --> 01:23.779
I thought if I got
my picture in the paper,

01:23.822 --> 01:26.129
maybe my dad would
want to meet me.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.523
But it's been
a month, so...

01:28.566 --> 01:31.830
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes, friends,
she wanted her father.

01:31.874 --> 01:34.355
And, boy, did she find him.

01:34.398 --> 01:37.009
I know. Now they're even
wearing coordinating outfits.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.580
Not her idea.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.800
And now,
Jane will blast us off

01:44.843 --> 01:49.370
into the pilot story
of This Is Mars.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.676
Okay.

01:51.720 --> 01:56.072
Okay. Uh, so, just
like This Is Us,

01:56.116 --> 01:59.858
our show will straddle two
timelines, only one timeline

01:59.902 --> 02:03.297
takes place
200 years in the future.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.474
A dys-- A
dystopian future,

02:06.517 --> 02:09.085
where humankind's
only hope for survival

02:09.129 --> 02:11.043
depends on
colonizing Mars.

02:11.087 --> 02:14.525
And there's only one man
and one woman for the job.

02:14.569 --> 02:19.530
And one Mars year later,
or 1.88 Earth years later,

02:19.574 --> 02:22.664
Steve becomes the first
president of the new colony.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.318
The show will
explore the mystery

02:24.361 --> 02:26.320
of how Earth became
uninhabitable.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.539
And how did Steve get
that tail?!

02:28.583 --> 02:30.846
At its heart, this
is a love story.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.500
And Steve and
Brenda's love,

02:32.543 --> 02:35.416
which spans decades
and traverses planets,

02:35.459 --> 02:38.245
is the strongest gravity
in the universe.

02:38.288 --> 02:42.249
And that is This Is Mars.

02:52.433 --> 02:55.175
Oh, no. What happened?

02:58.439 --> 03:00.528
BOTH:
We sold it!

03:03.183 --> 03:04.227
BOTH:
Ooh, ooh.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.924
Aah!

03:05.968 --> 03:07.752
I'm so proud of you two!

03:07.796 --> 03:09.014
Well, we would've
been here 30 minutes ago,

03:09.058 --> 03:10.233
but Dad made me learn
that dance.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.025
XIOMARA:
I'm so proud of you.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.550
You stuck with your dream
and you did it.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.029
Jane did it.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.075
I'm just lucky
I get to say

03:26.118 --> 03:28.469
my amazingly talented
writer-daughter's lines.

03:30.253 --> 03:33.213
What's wrong, amazingly
talented writer-daughter?

03:33.256 --> 03:36.607
Nothing. I-I just wanted
to call Rafael and tell him,

03:36.651 --> 03:39.001
and I remembered I can't.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.699
Anyway, it'll get easier
with time,

03:41.743 --> 03:44.267
and some space.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.095
But the pitch was
just step one.ROGELIO: Yes, yes.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.618
We still have to get
River on board.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.455
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
This is it, people.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.283
Third time's a charm.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.415
Oh!

04:12.861 --> 04:15.255
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw, one for
every time he asked.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.821
JANE:
Yay!

04:16.865 --> 04:18.562
Your love story may
not traverse planets,

04:18.606 --> 04:21.391
but it sends our hearts
soaring to the moon.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.132
LUISA:
Do you feel the vibrations?

04:23.175 --> 04:25.177
RAFAEL:
Yeah.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.483
Yeah, it's good now.

04:26.527 --> 04:29.834
It's all saged
and vibrating.

04:29.878 --> 04:33.403
Great. And have you been
using the crystals

04:33.447 --> 04:35.492
to set your intentions?
Because they can really,

04:35.536 --> 04:37.973
really give you
what you need energetically.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.409
Yeah. Totally.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.846
You think this is
all crazy, right?

04:41.890 --> 04:43.848
Yeah. Totally.

04:45.241 --> 04:48.288
But, still, I appreciate
your intentions.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.290
Mm, well, I just--

04:50.333 --> 04:52.509
I know how hard this breakup
with Jane has been,

04:52.553 --> 04:55.295
and I... I wanted to help.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.427
I'm feeling better,

04:57.471 --> 04:59.690
and it's been really nice
to have you through it.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.606
And I also thought about
your question some more.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.913
And...

05:06.393 --> 05:08.743
I am ready for you
to meet my kids.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.701
Uh, hold on.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.094
It's not just my call.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.575
I still have to talk
to Jane and Petra.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.229
The girls are really
warming up to you.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.362
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, wow, that was fast.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.712
Oh. My mistake.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.888
Great. I mean,
'cause it's definitely

05:23.932 --> 05:27.239
the most tickling,
skipping, pillow fighting

05:27.283 --> 05:28.980
I've done in my life.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.722
Well, their therapist
thinks it's working, so...

05:31.766 --> 05:34.159
Are you ready for
the next phase?

05:34.203 --> 05:36.814
Alone time with them?

05:36.858 --> 05:38.947
Well, don't say it like
you're in a horror movie.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.557
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I mean...

05:40.601 --> 05:43.081
BOTH:
Come play with us.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.474
You can keep it simple.

05:44.518 --> 05:48.739
Just... take 'em down
to the lounge for ice cream.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.393
I can do ice cream.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.920
Ah, it's my mentor.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.140
Did the bar association
get her recommendation?

05:58.183 --> 06:03.014
Yeah. And they refused
to reinstate my license.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.409
I mean, I knew...

06:06.453 --> 06:09.281
it was a long shot.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.719
It's fine.
I'm fine.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.982
JANE:
But despite all the obstacles,

06:14.025 --> 06:16.419
these two were destined
to be together.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.813
Because at its heart,
it's a love story.

06:18.856 --> 06:21.816
And Steve and Brenda's love,
which spans decades

06:21.859 --> 06:23.513
and traverses planets,

06:23.557 --> 06:26.342
is the strongest gravity
in the universe.

06:26.386 --> 06:30.433
And that is
This Is Mars.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.003
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Does she like it? Is she in?

06:35.046 --> 06:37.135
This is torture.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.139
I love it.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.229
Seriously,
what can I say?

06:44.273 --> 06:46.536
It's... it's out of this world.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.020
Perfect, perfect.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.848
So, once you sign
the contract,

06:53.891 --> 06:56.633
Jane will dive in and
start writing the script.

06:56.677 --> 06:57.982
You know, I do have one note.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.071
Yeah.Of course, yeah.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.771
I want someone else to write it.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.512
What?

07:05.555 --> 07:07.818
But it was Jane's idea.
And she is my daughter.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.690
Exactly. My nephew
shot a YouTube video

07:09.733 --> 07:12.388
of his friends Rollerblading.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.129
Do I bring him in to direct?

07:14.172 --> 07:15.478
I'm not signing on
to the project

07:15.522 --> 07:17.175
as long as Jane is the writer.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.481
No offense.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.527
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Offense taken!

07:27.098 --> 07:28.883
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
As you may recall,
when we last saw

07:28.926 --> 07:32.060
our father-daughter duo,
a River ran through them.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.278
She's not a River.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.716
She's a swamp.
She's worse than a swamp.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.195
She's a bog!

07:37.239 --> 07:39.110
Dad, she makes
a valid point.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.938
I've written one episode
of television.

07:40.982 --> 07:44.028
A Paloma-nominated episode.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.901
Still, I'm... I'm a novelist,
not a screenwriter.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.207
I-I'll just bow out
so you can bring in someone

07:49.251 --> 07:50.861
with more
telenovela experience.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.428
Absolutely not.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.691
This whole thing was
your stroke of genius.

07:54.735 --> 07:58.565
When River sees your pages,
your talent will be undeniable.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.089
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
No pressure, Jane.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.743
And speaking of pressure...

08:02.786 --> 08:05.702
It's your lucky day.

08:05.746 --> 08:08.270
We're all gonna make our own
sundaes. What do you think?

08:14.189 --> 08:16.931
Hey, you took all the
organic strawberries.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.193
Give it to me.RAMOS:
Girls...

08:18.236 --> 08:19.499
Hey!

08:19.542 --> 08:20.804
You snooze, you lose!RAMOS: Put that down.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.850
I'm not eating
that cheap, gross stuff.

08:22.893 --> 08:25.461
Gimme yours.RAMOS: Girls, stop it!

08:25.505 --> 08:27.855
No! Ellie, no.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.161
Please pick up-- Ladies--
Girls, stop, stop, stop.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.250
Hey, enough!

08:32.294 --> 08:35.166
Clean this up right now and
stop being such spoiled brats!

08:35.210 --> 08:37.604
Hey, you ready?
It's starting.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.431
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

08:45.394 --> 08:48.223
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw, it's an engagement party

08:48.266 --> 08:49.659
for Alba and Jorge.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.705
RAFAEL:
Hey, what's all this?

08:57.232 --> 08:58.929
Oh, congratulations, Alba.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.975
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.109
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So much for space.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.720
What are you doing here?

09:06.763 --> 09:08.504
Um, I was looking for you,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.245
actually.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.464
Do you have a minute
to talk?

09:12.508 --> 09:13.988
Sure, yeah. What's up?

09:14.031 --> 09:16.817
Well, I know things have been
a little rocky

09:16.860 --> 09:20.777
between us lately...
but I need a favor.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.431
Anything.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.998
I would really like
to introduce

09:24.041 --> 09:26.130
Mateo to my sister.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.568
Oh.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.529
I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.184
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Actually, Jane's very sure
how she feels about that.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.359
Luisa has been

09:37.402 --> 09:40.014
my rock over these
past few weeks.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.842
She's changed.

09:41.885 --> 09:45.497
This isn't the first time
Luisa claimed to have changed.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.325
And then, one look
from Rose, and...

09:47.369 --> 09:48.675
I know, I know.

09:48.718 --> 09:52.809
But it... just feels different
this time.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.028
I feel it.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.769
Look, she's the only
family I have,

09:55.812 --> 09:57.379
and it would mean
the world to me

09:57.422 --> 09:58.989
if she could meet my son.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.688
Can you give me a day
to think about it?

10:01.731 --> 10:03.603
Of course.

10:11.349 --> 10:12.873
JANE:
I want to say yes.

10:12.916 --> 10:16.267
I-I mean, Rafael seemed
convinced Luisa's changed.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.663
But I don't know
if I'd be agreeing to it

10:20.707 --> 10:22.839
because I believe it, too,
or if I'm secretly hoping

10:22.883 --> 10:24.798
that Rafael will be so grateful
that he'll realize

10:24.841 --> 10:27.191
he made a mistake
and fall back in love with me.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.237
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'm guessing the latter.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.902
XIOMARA:
Agreed.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.686
So, you good?

10:43.730 --> 10:45.209
Oh, well, not great.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.689
Good enough.
Come on, guys.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.212
We're starting
the wedding meeting.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.608
ROGELIO:
Your very own binder.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.827
I couldn't be more proud.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.090
What-- a-and did you use
my label maker?

10:56.133 --> 10:59.093
I certainly did, because
I'm in charge of planning.

10:59.136 --> 11:02.270
Ma, since your first
wedding got cut short,

11:02.313 --> 11:04.359
I want to go all-out.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.752
Make sure this
wedding is perfect.

11:05.795 --> 11:09.190
So, I called the
monsignor and booked

11:09.233 --> 11:11.714
the next available slot
for a wedding mass.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.498
Which is three
months from now.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.284
Oh. I-I know. It's soon.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.765
But I've got nothing
but time on my hands.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.854
We can get this done.

11:20.897 --> 11:24.292
Rogelio, you need to book
your glam squad ASAP.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.033
Mateo, you'll be
the ring bearer.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.383
And, Jane, you go write

11:28.426 --> 11:30.646
so you can help us when
you're done with the novela.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.127
Got it. On it. Dad, did you
bring the extra scripts?

11:33.170 --> 11:34.781
Yes.
Oh.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.174
Some of the best pilots
I've collected over the years.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.654
Use them as a guide.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.223
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here... now.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.181
How's it going?

11:44.225 --> 11:45.966
Great.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.881
I feel good.
I just have to make sure

11:47.924 --> 11:49.883
that I hit the five
key structural elements.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.799
Each character
has to have drive...

11:52.842 --> 11:54.496
something they desperately want.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.324
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Like winning over River Fields?

11:56.367 --> 11:58.761
Then an obstacle to getting it.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.502
The characters
need to overcome that

12:00.545 --> 12:02.069
but then get thwarted
by a massive complication

12:02.112 --> 12:03.766
which sets them back.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.769
Then the resolution when
they finally get what they want.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.466
And, of course,

12:08.510 --> 12:10.817
we end with the cliffhanger
no one saw coming.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.688
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sounds about right.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.037
Okay. Now go.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.604
I'm gonna dive in
so I can get River

12:15.647 --> 12:16.779
these scenes ASAP.Great.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.827
Ay.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.654
Mm-hmm.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.613
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Huh. What's Rogelio doing

12:24.656 --> 12:27.137
with Jane's book editor's
phone number?

12:27.181 --> 12:29.923
Could that be our...?

12:29.966 --> 12:31.925
And speaking of obstacles...

12:31.968 --> 12:34.231
Why didn't you tell me?

12:35.885 --> 12:38.105
I knew other Jane
was gonna tattle.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.802
That girl is
so predictable.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.717
Look, I know
I shouldn't have

12:41.761 --> 12:44.546
yelled at the girls
and called them spoiled brats.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.982
Actually, I meant that
you borrowed my favorite jacket

12:46.026 --> 12:47.070
and spilled red wine on it.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.029
Oh, I totally forgot
about that.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.596
I was gonna take it to the
dry cleaner yesterday, but...Forget the jacket.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.772
You yelled at my girls?

12:52.815 --> 12:55.035
They were being awful.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.428
They're in therapy.
They're trying.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.604
And you're supposed to
be gaining their trust,

12:59.648 --> 13:01.041
not traumatizing
them even more.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.391
They were throwing
ice cream everywhere

13:03.434 --> 13:05.872
and refusing to clean up
after themselves.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.700
What was I supposed to do,
just sit there and watch?

13:08.744 --> 13:10.572
That would have been better
than yelling at them.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.530
You weren't there. You didn't
see how they were acting.

13:12.574 --> 13:15.229
It doesn't matter!
It's not your place!

13:15.272 --> 13:18.275
You know what? My place
probably isn't here, either.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.155
So? What do you think?

13:28.198 --> 13:32.855
Well, I'm not going to lie.
I've got a lot of notes.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.989
But I don't want you
to get discouraged, Jane.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.513
Just like acting is reacting,
writing is rewriting.

13:38.556 --> 13:41.516
Of course.
Give it to me straight.

13:43.170 --> 13:46.913
Well, here, you say Steve
is "extremely handsome,"

13:46.956 --> 13:48.871
but later,

13:48.915 --> 13:50.307
when his tail is revealed,

13:50.351 --> 13:52.875
he's only "very handsome."

13:52.919 --> 13:55.008
You know?
If Steve is

13:55.051 --> 13:57.140
extremely handsome
in his tuxedo,

13:57.184 --> 13:59.926
he should be equally handsome
in his spacesuit.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.841
Or even more so.

14:01.884 --> 14:05.366
You see, the tail enhances
his handsomeness.

14:05.409 --> 14:08.195
Oh. Totally. Makes sense.

14:08.238 --> 14:10.197
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Does it, though?

14:10.240 --> 14:12.416
I'll make Steve
equally handsome throughout.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.201
Anything else?Uh, yes.

14:14.244 --> 14:17.813
Uh, there should be
six to eight more slow push-ins

14:17.857 --> 14:18.988
on Steve.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.860
And instead
of the head astronaut,

14:20.903 --> 14:22.687
I think that Steve
should be the one

14:22.731 --> 14:24.820
to plant the American flag
on Mars.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.866
Okay.

14:26.909 --> 14:31.044
Uh, what about the,
um, the plot and the dialogue?

14:31.087 --> 14:33.655
Oh, the plot
was perfection.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.178
So dramatic.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.485
And the dialogue was divine.

14:37.528 --> 14:40.314
Fun and romantic.Great.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.577
I-I'll just make these changes
and send it to River.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.840
Oh, I-I do have one
question for you, though.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.929
Why was my editor's number

14:46.973 --> 14:48.931
written on the back
of one of your scripts?

14:48.975 --> 14:52.326
Oh, that?

14:52.369 --> 14:55.111
I just wanted to send flowers
after your book launch,

14:55.155 --> 14:56.765
and I needed the address.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.506
Really?

14:58.549 --> 14:59.942
Yeah, really. Now focus up.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.597
We got a lot of work to do.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
Hey, Jeremy,
it's Jane Villanueva.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.564
Um, long time no speak.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.567
Hoping you can
call me back. Thanks.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.222
Come on, Mateo.
Time to go to Daddy's.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.140
So, what'd you decide?

15:24.184 --> 15:28.362
When I was Mateo's age,
I always wanted a big family,

15:28.405 --> 15:31.147
and Luisa's his aunt, so, yes.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.583
Introduce them.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.107
Thank you, Jane.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.502
I really appreciate this.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.243
And I know
Luisa will, too.

15:40.287 --> 15:43.072
She'll probably think
her crystals are working.

15:43.116 --> 15:46.293
She uses them
to "set her intention."

15:50.775 --> 15:52.734
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey, it's worth a shot.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.431
Set your intentions, Jane.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.781
Anyways, I'll just, uh,

15:56.825 --> 15:59.436
text her and find a time
that works for both of us.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.438
Let's check in on her
intentions, shall we?

16:01.482 --> 16:03.527
JANE:
I'm over him.
I'm so completely over him.

16:03.571 --> 16:06.617
I mean, I honestly can't
believe I was ever into him.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.837
That shirt is way too tight,
and look at

16:08.880 --> 16:10.099
all that gel in his hair.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.448
I am over, over, over him.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.624
Oh, who am I kidding?

16:13.668 --> 16:15.800
I love him so much.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.628
Jane.

16:17.672 --> 16:18.890
Are you okay?

16:18.934 --> 16:21.458
Yep. All good.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.200
Of course I'm not all good.
I love you so much.

16:24.244 --> 16:27.029
Okay, I should probably
get going.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.335
Wedding planning
duty calls.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.860
Sorry.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.344
PETRA:
Girls, go inside.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.041
Jane, stay here.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.696
Why didn't you tell me
J.R. yelled at my girls?

16:41.739 --> 16:43.393
I didn't think it was my place

16:43.437 --> 16:45.352
to get in the middle
of someone else's business.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.919
Since when? That's like
your calling card. 1-800-NOSY.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.139
Excuse me?Like, the one time it could've
actually been useful,

16:50.183 --> 16:52.315
you decide to stop meddling?
I am not okay with J.R. yelling

16:52.359 --> 16:54.013
at my children, and I could've
used the heads-up.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.015
Well, I'm not okay with
you yelling at me.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.147
And if you have an issue
with her, then you
should talk to her.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.149
Jane, I'm in a relationship
with a woman.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.064
Trust me, we talk, a lot.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.153
So you've talked about her role
in disciplining your kids?

17:04.197 --> 17:08.070
Well, no. We haven't
actually talked about that.

17:08.114 --> 17:11.073
So it's not really fair for you
to get mad at her or me.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.379
Now if you're done
yelling at me,

17:12.422 --> 17:15.077
I have to go get a wedding gift
for my grandma.

17:15.121 --> 17:18.298
XIOMARA:
This way, we can see what the
dress would look like a little.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.474
And what do you
think about

17:20.517 --> 17:22.954
Cattleya mossiaeorchids

17:22.998 --> 17:25.000
for your bouquet?LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Cattle-what now?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.002
It's the national flower
of Venezuela.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.135
I thought it might be nice
for you to have a little piece

17:29.178 --> 17:31.093
of home with you
when you walk down the aisle.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.835
Aw, I'm tearing up already.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.579
Great. I'm on it.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.201
Damn, grandma.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.379
Bye, Jorge.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.646
Ooh!

18:02.690 --> 18:05.432
Things are getting pretty steamy
between you two.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.911
Hard to wait?

18:06.955 --> 18:10.263
Well, I have
just the thing for that.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.874
This has worked wonders
for me over the years,

18:12.917 --> 18:16.095
so I only found it fitting
to give one to you.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.403
Ah!

18:20.447 --> 18:21.752
When you have urges,
you know,

18:21.796 --> 18:23.624
just think about
the flower and how...

18:26.801 --> 18:30.413
Though to be fair, hers
has already been crumpled.

18:30.457 --> 18:31.893
Not by Jorge.
Ooh!

18:31.936 --> 18:33.764
Oh.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.766
Ooh, I got to get this.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.596
Hey, uh, Jeremy. Thanks so much
for getting back to me.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.468
JEREMY:
Yeah, sorry, Jane,

18:41.511 --> 18:43.774
I'm just not really looking for
any new manuscripts right now.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.428
Oh, no, it's not that.

18:45.472 --> 18:48.823
Uh, I just wanted to apologize
if my dad called

18:48.866 --> 18:50.433
and harassed you in any way

18:50.477 --> 18:52.305
after my book came out.

18:52.348 --> 18:55.003
No. No, no, no, it was, uh,
nothing like that.

18:55.046 --> 18:58.920
Ah. But something definitely
happened between you two?

18:58.963 --> 19:00.661
Look, Jane, I promised

19:00.704 --> 19:03.403
I wouldn't say anything,
so you're really gonna

19:03.446 --> 19:05.927
have to talk to your pops
on that one. Sorry.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.715
So I talked to Jeremy.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.413
I know what you did.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.675
Oh.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.155
Thank you so much.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.417
You're not mad?

19:17.460 --> 19:19.419
Of course not.
Why would I be mad?

19:19.462 --> 19:20.550
Well, because you don't like it

19:20.594 --> 19:21.986
when I use my resources
to help you.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.510
Aha! How did you use
your resources?

19:23.553 --> 19:24.859
I-I didn't mean...I knew you did something.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.730
What was it? What did you do?

19:29.559 --> 19:32.954
I-I promised to pay
the publishers back

19:32.997 --> 19:35.696
if 10,000 copies of your book
didn't sell.

19:35.739 --> 19:39.003
Oh, my God.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.180
That's why I got published?

19:41.223 --> 19:43.094
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, if this
were a telenovela--

19:43.138 --> 19:46.794
which it is-- I'd say we've
just gotten to our big...

19:46.837 --> 19:49.318
RIVER: Hola, mi
peeps.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.233
Hola.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.452
What did you think?

19:52.495 --> 19:54.018
I loved it.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.890
Oh!

19:55.933 --> 19:58.501
I mean, honestly, I was worried
that, as Rogelio's daughter,

19:58.545 --> 20:00.590
that you would favor
Steve over Brenda,

20:00.634 --> 20:02.288
but you did
a great job

20:02.331 --> 20:04.899
of making us equal costars.

20:04.942 --> 20:05.987
Thank you, River.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.859
But actually,
I disagree.

20:08.903 --> 20:12.036
I think Brenda's
underserved by this story.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.648
I want to see her
really shine.

20:14.691 --> 20:18.304
I mean, your talent greatly,
greatly outpaces my father's,

20:18.347 --> 20:20.697
and I think that should be
reflected in these pages.

20:20.741 --> 20:22.264
You need several
more monologues,

20:22.308 --> 20:23.918
of course.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.789
A-And I want to give her
an additional lover

20:25.833 --> 20:27.791
because Steve's face is gonna
be horribly disfigured

20:27.835 --> 20:29.750
by a Martian mining accident
at the end of the pilot.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.534
ROGELIO:
Jane, even if

20:31.578 --> 20:34.276
that were to happen, I...Oh. And he's gonna
lose his genitals.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.930
Oh, oh, that sounds like

20:35.973 --> 20:38.889
some pretty crazy,
risky television.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.935
It's gonna be great.
And did I mention,

20:40.978 --> 20:42.371
I think Brenda
should be the one

20:42.415 --> 20:44.199
who plants the American
flag on Mars,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.027
because she's the one
doing all the work.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.768
I am so in.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.335
Let's do it.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.598
Mm!

20:51.641 --> 20:53.034
Bye.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.079
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Adiós, mi peeps.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.174
XIOMARA:
Oh, good, you're home. Your
abuelais being wishy-washy

21:03.218 --> 21:05.699
about wedding colors, and
we need to move fast.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.703
What's wrong?

21:13.968 --> 21:15.317
Oh.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.188
The meeting went
great, right?

21:17.232 --> 21:19.974
Come on! Do the dance.
Break it down. Ooh.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.019
JANE:
Nope. No dance.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.413
It actually didn't
go well at all.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.415
River didn't like the pages?

21:26.459 --> 21:28.374
River loved the pages.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.942
JANE: I am so glad
that you asked, Abuela.

21:31.986 --> 21:34.162
Dad, you want to tell them
what the problem is?

21:34.205 --> 21:36.033
The problem is he bribed
the publishing company,

21:36.077 --> 21:37.861
and that's the only reason
my book got published.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.341
What?No!

21:39.385 --> 21:40.951
Be honest. You two
didn't know about this?

21:40.995 --> 21:43.084
No way.

21:48.568 --> 21:51.527
I-I'm sorry.

21:51.571 --> 21:54.704
I just wanted to do
something nice for you, Jane.

21:54.748 --> 21:57.141
You were still grieving Michael,

21:57.185 --> 22:00.057
and you had worked so hard
on your book.

22:00.101 --> 22:02.712
And I knew
how important

22:02.756 --> 22:05.454
being a published author
was to you.Exactly!

22:05.498 --> 22:07.891
It was the most important
accomplishment of my life,

22:07.935 --> 22:09.284
and it's a lie!

22:11.939 --> 22:15.377
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And whileour Jane was
down in the dumps,

22:15.421 --> 22:18.119
so was the other Jane.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.773
Hey.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.383
Do you have a minute?

22:21.427 --> 22:23.385
I got a lot
of side work to finish

22:23.429 --> 22:25.996
before my shift ends,
so now's not a great time.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.651
Yeah. This isn't exactly
the bar J.R. wanted

22:28.695 --> 22:30.261
to be associated with.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.264
I just came
to apologize.

22:33.308 --> 22:36.964
I know the girls
can be difficult.

22:37.007 --> 22:40.097
And I never set any rules
when it came to you

22:40.141 --> 22:41.751
acting in a parenting
capacity with them.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.274
So maybe it would help

22:43.318 --> 22:46.582
if we set those
ground rules now.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.845
Did other Jane
give you this advice?

22:48.889 --> 22:50.934
Yeah, she did.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.022
Well, it's reductive.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.763
'Cause life
isn't that neat.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.156
Yeah, it might not be,

22:55.199 --> 22:56.940
but we should still talk
about what happened.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.942
I know I messed up.

22:58.986 --> 23:02.119
And I really want to fix this.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.905
I'm listening.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.211
Can we maybe just not do this
right by the dumpster?

23:07.255 --> 23:08.648
'Cause I think
I'm gonna pass out.

23:10.301 --> 23:13.217
Aw. Looks like things
are starting to thaw.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.315
Oh, it's just, um...

24:07.358 --> 24:10.013
over the past year,

24:10.057 --> 24:12.059
when-whenever I started
to doubt myself,

24:12.102 --> 24:15.192
I'd remind myself...

24:15.236 --> 24:18.239
I'm a published author.

24:18.282 --> 24:21.068
It was the one
accomplishment

24:21.111 --> 24:23.810
I could always
go back to.

24:23.853 --> 24:25.768
I just feel like a fraud.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.774
Well, I can't write for him.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.833
RAMOS:
I just feel like
a total failure.

24:46.876 --> 24:50.924
I had zero control
over the girls,

24:50.967 --> 24:53.709
and so I lost my cool
and snapped.

24:53.753 --> 24:57.365
I don't have your patience.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.236
Please.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.413
When I give them time-outs,
it's mostly for me.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.330
And you can give them
time-out, too.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.507
And hey, when it doubt,
just threaten the iPad.

25:12.162 --> 25:15.557
Okay, I got
to be honest.

25:15.601 --> 25:19.561
It's not so much their behavior
in particular so much as...

25:19.605 --> 25:21.041
What?

25:22.651 --> 25:25.393
They're just so entitled.

25:25.436 --> 25:29.136
And, well...

25:29.179 --> 25:32.356
you know how scrappy
my childhood was.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.230
We couldn't even afford rent,
let alone dinner every night.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.885
I mean, that's why
I never wanted to have kids.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.278
I just wanted
to take care of myself.

25:41.322 --> 25:44.194
I never wanted to feel
that fear again.

25:44.238 --> 25:47.807
I just wanted--
I just focused on my career,

25:47.850 --> 25:52.115
and... now...

25:52.159 --> 25:54.944
even that's gone.

25:54.988 --> 25:57.991
And I just feel like
I'm at rock bottom.

26:00.602 --> 26:04.563
And so, yeah, I-I took it out
on the girls.

26:04.606 --> 26:07.827
And I won't do that again.

26:09.524 --> 26:12.266
And I overreacted because...

26:12.309 --> 26:13.876
you're right.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.965
They are spoiled.

26:16.009 --> 26:19.665
I went the other way, I guess,
to make up for my childhood.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.974
So help me with it.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.151
Okay.

26:30.763 --> 26:33.156
And I'm so sorry

26:33.200 --> 26:35.985
that you feel like
you're at rock bottom.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.902
I wish I could
help you with that.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.165
You are.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.167
Trust me.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.234
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, hello.

27:35.828 --> 27:37.830
Not that he's counting
or anything.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.106
There you are.
Lots to do.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.638
What do you mean?
The church was booked.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.392
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Emphasis on "quick."

28:23.658 --> 28:25.225
Emphasis on "just."

28:33.494 --> 28:35.452
Okay.

28:35.496 --> 28:38.151
If that's what you two want,
I'm on board.

28:38.194 --> 28:39.543
JANE:
Me, too.

28:39.587 --> 28:42.329
Did you want to have
any kind of reception, or...

28:44.461 --> 28:46.420
Told ya, got to be quick.

28:46.463 --> 28:49.553
Oh. Wow. Easy.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.912
Thank you.

28:59.955 --> 29:04.351
Now let's get this woman laid.
I mean, married.

29:04.394 --> 29:05.700
Yay!

29:10.574 --> 29:11.924
XIOMARA: No.
The Cattleya mossiaeorchid.

29:11.967 --> 29:15.666
It has to be
the Cattleya mossiae.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.407
I need them
in two hours.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.932
Good news.
I found my veil.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.455
Ah.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.152
Hey, Abuela.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.632
You okay?

29:24.675 --> 29:26.155
Mm.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.896
JANE:
You're not feeling
guilty, are you?

29:27.940 --> 29:31.117
Because I think Abuelo
would be so happy for you.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.628
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of family...

30:04.672 --> 30:06.326
Hey, Mr. Sweetface.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.154
Head to your room.
There are clothes laid out

30:08.197 --> 30:10.983
for you to change
into. Hurry.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.985
Thanks for getting him
here so fast.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.291
Of course. But what
was the rush?

30:15.335 --> 30:19.861
My grandmother decided
to get married, today!

30:19.905 --> 30:21.732
Really?

30:21.776 --> 30:23.038
Oh, God, how exciting for her.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.999
And you should be there.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.828
It's an important moment
for our whole family.

30:32.743 --> 30:35.790
I will go get changed
and meet you at the church.

30:49.630 --> 30:52.894
Today isn't about my feelings.
It's about our family.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.896
And Rafael is
a part of it.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.726
Good.

30:58.769 --> 31:00.859
Now go on and change.
We got to get you to the church.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.035
We are literally
at the church.

31:03.078 --> 31:04.558
Where are the orchids?

31:04.601 --> 31:06.603
That is not acceptable.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.649
Get here now.

31:10.259 --> 31:13.132
It's not okay. They promised
they'd have those flowers here.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.439
Yes, you do.JANE: Mom.

31:16.483 --> 31:19.094
Why are you getting so
upset about those flowers?

31:19.138 --> 31:21.140
They're just...
important.

31:33.587 --> 31:38.418
I... just wanted to do
one thing for you, for once,

31:38.461 --> 31:40.376
because you've done

31:40.420 --> 31:42.683
such a great job
with being my mom.

31:42.726 --> 31:46.687
And this was my chance
to finally do something for you.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.645
To thank you.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.996
Oh, Xiomara.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.649
Especially after
the year I've had

31:52.693 --> 31:55.261
and how you've been with me
through all of it.

31:58.394 --> 32:02.355
I never thought at 46
I'd still need my mom so much.

32:19.241 --> 32:22.244
Hey, are you guys ready?
Jorge's getting...

32:23.942 --> 32:25.987
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.947
I'll just...

32:35.040 --> 32:36.824
What?

32:36.867 --> 32:39.218
You never stop
wanting to do

32:39.261 --> 32:41.350
whatever you can
for your child.

32:45.833 --> 32:46.834
Dad.

32:46.877 --> 32:48.967
Yes?

32:49.010 --> 32:50.490
Let's talk.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.666
I am so sorry, Jane.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.929
I never meant to undermine
your confidence.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.062
And I know it was
a wrong thing to do,

32:57.105 --> 32:58.324
but I just wanted to help.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.152
I know.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.328
And I know it came
from a good place.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.158
I just have to
recalibrate things now,

33:06.201 --> 33:12.033
about myself as a writer
and my career.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.079
Does it help to know
that River signed the contract?

33:14.122 --> 33:17.386
And she certainly wasn't
looking to do me any favors.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.867
She just really loved
your writing.

33:19.910 --> 33:21.956
Thanks, Dad.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.740
And I do, too.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.177
And this is my career,

33:25.220 --> 33:27.092
and I don't mess around
with my career, Jane.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.355
Thanks for that, Dad.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.052
I love you.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.314
Thank God. I love you, too.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.928
U-Uh, I'm sorry.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.887
Is Alba still in the building?

33:39.930 --> 33:41.541
She just needs another minute.

33:41.584 --> 33:42.759
But she's coming?

33:42.803 --> 33:45.197
Yeah, don't worry.
She's definitely coming.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.199
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

33:49.418 --> 33:51.768
I can't.
I'm already a mess.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.818
I can't believe
you got these with your phone.

36:08.862 --> 36:13.040
Right? I was thinking,
let's make her a wedding album

36:13.083 --> 36:14.650
since she's never had one.

36:14.694 --> 36:17.175
Love that idea, yes.

36:20.787 --> 36:24.182
Was it hard today?
Not being with Rafael?

36:25.922 --> 36:28.664
Actually, seeing him at the
wedding as a part of my family,

36:28.708 --> 36:31.145
it was the first time
I'd been with him in weeks

36:31.189 --> 36:32.929
when my heart didn't just break.

36:32.973 --> 36:34.496
It was brief.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.151
But still.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.154
It helps that, no matter
what, we're family.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.200
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of family...

36:44.071 --> 36:45.028
Great news, Jane.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.814
You're officially famous.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.598
Aw.

36:49.642 --> 36:51.252
Looks like Jane's picture
in the paper

36:51.296 --> 36:53.123
brought her closer
to her father after all.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.996
In other words, it's...

36:56.039 --> 36:58.564
Thanks, Dad. Oh.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.609
And thank you, guys,
for letting me stay the night.

37:00.653 --> 37:03.656
I am super happy for Abuela,
but I did not want to hear that.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.484
And I think I started to.

37:05.527 --> 37:07.268
For the record,
things were starting

37:07.312 --> 37:09.183
to get pretty loud.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.447
And, friends, I can't show you
what's going to happen next.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.362
But let's just say...

37:32.162 --> 37:34.121
RAMOS:
You look happy.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.906
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm with you.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.520
We don't want to
wear the shoes.

37:41.563 --> 37:43.304
Yeah, they're ugly.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.742
Put them on.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.225
Okay, no iPad.

37:53.183 --> 37:55.403
Fine. If you want us
to look basic.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.322
ANNIE :
Ooh.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.802
I love you.

38:02.845 --> 38:03.890
Ooh.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.718
I love you, too.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.110
Oh!

38:07.154 --> 38:08.634
You guys
are pretty funny.

38:08.677 --> 38:10.897
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw, look at them.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.291
One big happy family.

38:14.944 --> 38:17.077
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh. Sorry.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.470
Hold on, one second.

38:18.513 --> 38:19.993
Hello?

38:20.036 --> 38:21.690
Oh, wow.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.737
Yes.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.739
Thank you.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.828
Okay.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.830
Bye.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.747
What? Who was that?

38:34.790 --> 38:36.749
Um, my mentor.

38:36.792 --> 38:39.099
She thinks she found me
a job opportunity.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.927
Not as a lawyer,

38:40.970 --> 38:42.581
but in the legal field.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.757
What? That's amazing!

38:44.800 --> 38:46.846
Oh, congratulations.

38:46.889 --> 38:49.414
Thing is the job's in Houston.

38:49.457 --> 38:52.286
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from Houston...

38:52.330 --> 38:53.635
to Mars.

38:58.858 --> 39:01.339
And, friends, just like that,

39:01.382 --> 39:03.993
Jane felt inspired to write.

39:07.823 --> 39:09.912
Wait, this isn't Mars.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.482
Wow.

39:14.526 --> 39:16.745
Jane hasn't written
her novel for months.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.268
I'm your father.

39:26.668 --> 39:29.279
You were incredible, Dad.

39:29.323 --> 39:30.977
Did you just call me Dad?

39:31.020 --> 39:32.587
ROGELIO: Here's where
you're getting married.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.067
And as you can see,

39:34.110 --> 39:37.853
the reception will spill out
onto the soundstage.

39:37.897 --> 39:38.985
JANE:
I now pronounce you

39:39.028 --> 39:41.770
husband and wife.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.685
What are you doing?!

39:43.729 --> 39:45.165
Chin up, Jane! Jazz hands!Oh, no, no!

39:59.919 --> 40:01.529
ROGELIO:
I love you, Jane.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.618
Oh, I love you, Dad.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.317
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Beautiful, just beautiful.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.232
Only problem:

40:09.276 --> 40:11.147
She's supposed to be writing
a telenovela.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.714
You're on a deadline, Jane.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.324
Never mind.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.326
She's on a roll.

40:16.370 --> 40:18.851
I'll take this back
to our telenovela instead.

40:18.894 --> 40:21.984
Mateo. There's someone here
to meet you.

40:22.028 --> 40:24.552
LUISA:
Hi, little man.

40:24.596 --> 40:28.556
Are you my Aunt Luisa,
the one who made me get born?

40:28.600 --> 40:30.471
LUISA:
I sure am.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.212
And I'm so happy
to finally meet you.

40:32.255 --> 40:33.779
How come just now?

40:33.822 --> 40:37.652
Well, I was... travelling.

40:37.696 --> 40:39.698
But I'm home now.

40:39.741 --> 40:41.613
Back with my family.

40:41.656 --> 40:44.137
Finally.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.705
So, should we go to the beach?

40:47.836 --> 40:49.403
Oh, I-I...

40:49.447 --> 40:51.492
wasn't really planning on
leaving the apartment.

40:51.536 --> 40:54.452
I thought maybe we'd stay in
and play some board games

40:54.495 --> 40:56.802
Oh, come on, Rafael.
I brought beach toys.

40:56.845 --> 40:59.631
Yeah, come on, Daddy.
Beach, beach, beach, beach.

40:59.674 --> 41:01.981
BOTH :
Beach, beach, beach,
beach, beach, beach...

41:02.024 --> 41:04.244
Okay, fine, beach day it is.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.554
Ah. One-one second.Wait, wait, wait.

41:09.597 --> 41:10.685
Hello?

41:10.729 --> 41:11.904
Rafael, it's Dennis.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.427
Do you know
where your sister is?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.037
Yes, I do.

41:15.081 --> 41:16.778
Well, we just found out
that all the money

41:16.822 --> 41:18.476
from Rose's Satin Road
was funneled into

41:18.519 --> 41:19.955
an account under her name.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.870
We think they're still
working together.

41:23.785 --> 41:26.179
I'll call you
right back.

41:44.284 --> 41:46.286
