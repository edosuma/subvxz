WEBVTT

00:10.793 --> 00:12.229
Hey.

00:12.316 --> 00:14.840
Hey, boss. I got your text.
What's up?

00:14.927 --> 00:17.104
I got a call
from the FBI.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.757
What do they want?

00:18.844 --> 00:22.457
It's about the investigation
of Craig O'Laughlin's death.

00:22.544 --> 00:23.632
Oh.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.547
It was an agent
named Wexler.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.592
He said he'd been
trying to reach you.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.246
Yeah, he left some messages.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.901
I haven't called him back.
What did he say?

00:31.988 --> 00:34.947
The investigation's over.
They've filed the report.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.081
He just wanted you to know that
he was returning your necklace.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.169
My what?

00:39.256 --> 00:41.128
The necklace
O'Laughlin gave you.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.434
It was in evidence,
but they're done with it.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.870
He sent it over.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.090
I don't..

00:47.177 --> 00:49.223
Look, I don't want it.
You take it.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.529
If you don't want it,
you can sell it

00:51.616 --> 00:53.357
or take it
to the evidence room

00:53.444 --> 00:55.316
and they can auction it off.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.799
Here, it's for you.

01:00.886 --> 01:02.801
[gunshots]

01:05.543 --> 01:07.328
Hey, boss..

01:07.415 --> 01:10.505
Caught one. Shooting victim
out in El Oro State Forest.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.507
You two take it.

01:12.594 --> 01:15.031
- Grace? Are you okay?
- Fine, yeah.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.686
- You want me to take it away?
- No, it's okay.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.950
El Oro State Forest, that's
East of Lake Tahoe, right?

01:21.037 --> 01:22.430
Yeah.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.528
[instrumental music]

01:44.930 --> 01:46.236
You get lost?

01:46.323 --> 01:48.020
Briefly.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.459
Beautiful out here, though they
could use a little more signage.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.156
Victim's name's
Gabriel Porchetto Junior.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.853
Father's a big mob boss.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.900
Runs narcotics and illegal
gambling in the Northeast.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.468
They live in the city.
This is a vacation house.

02:00.555 --> 02:03.775
"Porchetto"
that's Argentinian, I believe.

02:03.862 --> 02:04.994
How can you tell?

02:05.081 --> 02:07.301
I used to read
a lot of phone books.

02:07.388 --> 02:10.042
As I recall, Buenos Aires
had many Porchettos.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.914
You used to read phone books.

02:12.001 --> 02:15.961
Yes, it's an excellent mnemonic
exercise. You should try it.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.486
[Cho]
'Porchetto and his younger
brother were throwing a party.'

02:18.573 --> 02:19.965
'Had a half-dozen friends here.'

02:20.052 --> 02:21.619
Brought in hookers
for entertainment.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.578
Good, wholesome fun.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.971
There's a security fence
around the entire compound.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.712
About a hundred yards
that way

02:27.799 --> 02:29.801
there's a blanket
thrown over the barbed wire

02:29.888 --> 02:32.500
and footprints inside and out.
Looks like the point of entry.

02:32.587 --> 02:33.979
Hmm.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.981
And here we are.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.163
Ugh.

02:44.642 --> 02:46.470
Which one's
the younger brother?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.212
Sergio.

02:52.607 --> 02:53.999
Yeah?

02:54.086 --> 02:56.959
So you're Sergio,
and, uh...who are you?

02:57.046 --> 02:59.135
Curtis Nett.
I work for the family.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.397
The enforcer.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.486
I work for the family.
Ten years.

03:02.573 --> 03:03.922
Just tell us what happened.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.577
We were inside
the house, partying.

03:06.664 --> 03:09.624
Gabe came out to the hot tub
with one of the girls.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.192
There's a shot.
Curtis and I run out and..

03:13.628 --> 03:16.500
Gabe's...you know.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.241
Girl's freaking out.

03:18.328 --> 03:21.331
I run to the fence.
I see a guy just climbed over.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.421
I throw a shot at him.
He throws a shot at me.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.467
No one hit anything.
He takes off running.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.033
You get a look at him?

03:28.120 --> 03:30.122
White guy, jacket,
baseball cap.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.124
'You gave your gun
to the sheriff, right?'

03:32.212 --> 03:33.735
That's right.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.303
We need all the other guns
even the ones hidden.

03:36.390 --> 03:39.393
Look at this mess. You want to
talk some crap weapons charges?

03:39.480 --> 03:40.872
We won't necessarily
press charges

03:40.959 --> 03:43.135
but I need every gun
for a ballistics check.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.746
I'll tell the guys.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.139
You do that, Serge.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.750
So what's the deal?

03:48.837 --> 03:51.840
You work for the family,
but you have no respect for him.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.015
Is that a question?

03:53.102 --> 03:54.625
I don't know. Was it?

03:54.712 --> 03:57.280
Where's the girl?
That's a question.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.503
[sighs]
Her name is Janpen.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.722
She's Chinese.
Doesn't speak English.

04:04.809 --> 04:07.899
Okay. Hi.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.423
My name is Patrick.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.077
[speaks Chinese]

04:13.383 --> 04:16.256
We're gonna need
a translator.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.215
What is that hideous thing
on her shoulder?

04:19.302 --> 04:21.261
[singsongy]
She speaks English.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.350
She's just a little
bit shy, right?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.745
I don't speak English.
Guys don't talk to me.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.356
It's better that way.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.880
So what did you see
when Mr. Porchetto was shot?

04:31.967 --> 04:35.100
Nothing. There's a loud bang
scares the crap out of me, and..

04:35.187 --> 04:37.755
...the guy's dead. I mean,
I freaked out. That's it.

04:37.842 --> 04:39.017
What'd the shooter
look like?

04:39.104 --> 04:40.410
Didn't see him.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.456
You're a good liar.
Good, not great.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.284
She saw him close up.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.851
I know who these guys are,
I'm not getting involved.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.288
Maybe you shot him.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.551
Yeah, I hid the gun
in my pants.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.901
I'm taking you in.
We'll talk at the office.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.685
I don't have to go with you.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.383
I could arrest you
for prostitution..

04:56.470 --> 04:58.559
...is that how
you want to do it?

04:58.646 --> 05:00.691
Well, can I put
some clothes on first?

05:00.778 --> 05:02.171
Sure.

05:08.046 --> 05:10.571
Interesting girl.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.574
So what's
your take on this?

05:13.661 --> 05:16.185
Well, the fresh air,
my first mob hit..

05:16.272 --> 05:17.752
I'm thrilled.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.442
[shuts glove compartment]

05:58.880 --> 06:00.621
What?

06:00.708 --> 06:03.450
The GPS says turn right,
but I think it's confused.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.426
Morning. You lost?

06:23.513 --> 06:24.949
We're fine, thanks.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.952
[gunshots]

06:35.438 --> 06:38.354
[gunshots]

06:48.190 --> 06:49.409
Ah!

06:49.496 --> 06:50.410
Hang on!

06:57.765 --> 07:00.637
[theme music]

07:11.039 --> 07:13.955
[panting]

07:29.361 --> 07:31.668
Hey. You okay?

07:34.715 --> 07:36.238
Hey! Hey!

07:37.544 --> 07:39.763
Hey! Stop.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.983
Stop. I will shoot you.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.163
Nice driving.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.171
Don't waste your time.
There's no signal.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.868
Um..

07:57.955 --> 08:00.915
there was some noise over there,
like some kind of animal.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.352
Freaked me out.
Unlock me, okay?

08:03.439 --> 08:06.703
We can't stay here, and we
can't go back up to the road.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.140
There's too much chance
of running into that guy.

08:09.227 --> 08:11.142
We follow the stream
East a ways

08:11.229 --> 08:12.927
we'll probably run
into State Route four.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.711
We can catch
a cell signal there.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.278
I'm not going anywhere.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.409
It's not a choice.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.846
Can't make me.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.457
We need help.
I'm trying to protect you.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.634
Yeah, so I can testify
against the mob.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.245
Forget it.

08:27.332 --> 08:28.769
Okay.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.598
- I'll go by myself.
- Cool. Unlock me.

08:31.685 --> 08:35.166
I need to know where to find you
when we come back for you.

08:35.253 --> 08:36.907
Hey, you can't do that.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.779
Watch out
for rattlesnakes.

08:38.866 --> 08:41.259
'They're all over
through these woods.'

08:41.346 --> 08:43.784
Okay, wait!

08:43.871 --> 08:46.003
[male #1]
'I've spoken
with the forestry service.'

08:46.090 --> 08:47.309
They're beginning
a coordinated search

08:47.396 --> 08:48.963
with the sheriff's office.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.269
It's likely the GPS
gave Van Pelt bad directions.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.836
They've had people
lost this way.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.099
They don't think
she's gonna be hard to find.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.885
Get some of our people looking.
More boots on the ground.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.539
They're not taking
this seriously.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.323
How big is the area
they're searching?

09:01.410 --> 09:02.846
One hundred and forty
square miles.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.195
It sounds pretty serious.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.197
If you were there,
we'd look for you.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.851
I hope not.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.984
If I'm lost, I want
a search-and-rescue team

09:10.071 --> 09:12.464
that knows the landscape
and can cover ground fast.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.293
Now I will make sure
every resource is devoted

09:15.380 --> 09:19.863
to finding Van Pelt. Okay?
Meantime, let's do our jobs.

09:22.387 --> 09:23.693
Boss, we need to be--

09:23.780 --> 09:25.652
He's right.
We don't know the terrain.

09:25.739 --> 09:29.003
We'll just get in the way.
Let's focus on what we cando.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.657
What do you got?

09:30.744 --> 09:34.008
Ballistics came in.
Junior was shot with a .380.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.792
One casing found
at the crime scene

09:35.879 --> 09:37.446
another, 10 yards
outside the fence.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.970
That must've been the shot
the killer fired at Nett

09:40.057 --> 09:41.450
when he was running away.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.887
- Any luck on the gun trace?
- No. Nothing.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.977
This feels like a hit to me,
like a pro at work.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.718
He had to have driven there.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.025
Let's check the gas stations
and the convenience stores

09:51.112 --> 09:53.810
on the road to the cabin.
Maybe he stopped off somewhere.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.856
Do we have anything
on the witness Janpen?

09:55.943 --> 09:58.380
No arrests. The other hookers
didn't have anything to say.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.991
I'm trying to find the pimp
that arranged the party.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.777
Take a hard look at
the wise guys that were there.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.823
If someone would know how
to hire a hit man, it's them.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.130
Van Pelt will be
back here in 20 minutes

10:09.217 --> 10:11.654
and we're all gonna
feel stupid for worrying.

10:20.315 --> 10:23.710
File on Porchetto Senior's
quite an interesting read.

10:23.797 --> 10:27.191
Murder, robbery, thuggery,
all sorts of skullduggery.

10:27.278 --> 10:30.107
The organized crime unit's been
after Porchetto for a while.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.676
There's nothing more
you can do.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.199
About what?

10:35.286 --> 10:37.071
Van Pelt. That's what
you're fretting about.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.334
Van Pelt is missing
because of the murder

10:39.421 --> 10:41.771
ergo, we focus on
catching the murderer

10:41.858 --> 10:43.643
chances are
we'll find Van Pelt..

10:43.730 --> 10:45.949
unless someone else
finds her first, but right now?

10:46.036 --> 10:47.516
Let's go. Porchettos.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.656
Agent Lisbon. Mr. Jane.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.266
Andrew Kellogg.
I'm the Porchettos' attorney.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.747
This is Iris Porchetto,
Gabe's stepmother.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.313
Where is Mr. Porchetto?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.098
On his way.
He's not feeling well.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.621
We'll have to
keep this brief.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.970
We'll have to be thorough

11:07.057 --> 11:08.798
but I'll keep
your concerns in mind.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.148
Let's play cards up, agent.

11:11.235 --> 11:14.195
The police have unjustly hounded
the Porchettos for years.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.545
I will not stand
for that sort of thing.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.329
'These the cops?'

11:18.416 --> 11:20.767
[Lisbon]
We're with the CBI,
Mr. Porchetto.

11:20.854 --> 11:24.422
This is who they send
to find my boy's killer?

11:24.509 --> 11:26.511
A girl and a guy in a vest.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.644
This is really a waste
of my time.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.777
- I want a drink.
- No.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.866
Gabe is dead.
I can have a drink.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.520
Not with your meds.
It's got bad interaction.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.958
Uh, excuse me.
Where is the cancer?

11:38.045 --> 11:39.611
What's your name?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.092
Jane. Patrick Jane.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.094
Liver? Kidney? Spleen?

11:44.181 --> 11:45.356
Kidney.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.707
Oh. How long
did they give you?

11:47.794 --> 11:50.405
"How long"? I'm a dead man.
That's how long.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.494
Having trouble sleeping,
I expect.

11:52.581 --> 11:55.018
Yes. Why?

11:55.105 --> 11:57.629
Well, I can tell you
how to get to sleep

11:57.717 --> 12:00.328
if you tell us
who you think killed your son.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.069
Who says I know?

12:02.156 --> 12:04.332
You said you were
wasting your time with us

12:04.419 --> 12:06.595
so I assumed you already knew
who was responsible.

12:06.682 --> 12:08.336
Do you, Mr. Porchetto?

12:08.423 --> 12:10.294
- Don't say anything.
- Honey, listen to Andrew.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.819
This one can't wait
to put me in the ground.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.168
That's not true.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.170
That's not true.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.346
Maybe just a little true?

12:18.433 --> 12:21.349
You want me
to do your job? Fine.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.177
It was the Mexicans.

12:23.264 --> 12:24.569
What Mexicans?

12:24.656 --> 12:26.920
Julio Iglesias.
Who do you think?

12:27.007 --> 12:29.792
The Zetas.
The Zetas.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.794
- The Mexican drug cartel?
- Yeah.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.883
Why would they want
to kill your son?

12:33.970 --> 12:37.626
I'm not saying any more.
About that sleeping trick..

12:37.713 --> 12:40.324
Oh, yes.
When you breathe in, count one.

12:40.411 --> 12:45.373
When you breathe out, count two.
In one, out two. Very simple.

12:45.460 --> 12:49.246
Think of nothing else, except
your breath and those numbers.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.466
And that will make me sleep?

12:51.553 --> 12:54.338
Like a big, murderous baby.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.079
Ciao.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.476
Organized crime unit says
Junior wanted the Porchettos

13:01.563 --> 13:03.043
to sell meth in the Northeast.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.349
The Zetas control the drug trade
in that territory.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.874
If junior did make a move,
they could've killed him.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.571
Call Bernie Westeroff
in narcotics.

13:09.658 --> 13:13.227
See if he has a line on any
Zeta foot soldiers in the area.

13:13.314 --> 13:16.099
You're gonna get
a Mexican drug dealer to talk?

13:16.186 --> 13:18.058
- I'll think of something.
- Ohh.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.670
Wayne.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.106
Sarah.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.891
Yeah, I was looking for you.
Lunch.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.588
Oh. Damn. I forgot.

13:26.675 --> 13:27.981
[sighs]

13:28.068 --> 13:30.026
No, look, I'm sorry.
Grace is missing.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.854
Oh, my lord.
What's happened?

13:31.941 --> 13:35.031
We-we don't know. Look,
she was in a state park and..

13:35.118 --> 13:37.338
anyway, I have to work.
I'm sorry.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.906
Of course. You work.
We'll just do it another time.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.472
Yeah. Just call me
later, okay?

13:41.559 --> 13:43.213
And I'm sure it's fine.
She's fine.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.085
Thanks.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.493
Um..

14:02.580 --> 14:04.582
It's really hard
to walk like this.

14:04.669 --> 14:07.150
Should have thought of that
before you ran.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.807
[rustle]

14:12.503 --> 14:14.941
Stay here.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.333
[rustle]

14:26.735 --> 14:29.303
[rustle]

14:36.527 --> 14:39.095
[wings flapping]

14:39.182 --> 14:41.315
'Hey, Grace.'

14:41.402 --> 14:43.143
[pants]

14:48.191 --> 14:50.454
- Who are you?
- Come on, Grace.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.847
Craig's dead. I killed him.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.415
Yeah. Yeah, you did that.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.156
Are you a ghost?

14:56.243 --> 14:58.201
What do you think?

15:01.291 --> 15:03.250
If you're not a ghost,
what are you?

15:03.337 --> 15:05.295
Grace, look, you've been
in a car accident.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.907
You're dehydrated,
pumped on adrenaline.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.909
Maybe I'm just
something you're seeing.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.825
The question is, why now?

15:13.913 --> 15:16.263
Why do you need
to see me, Grace?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.265
[Janpen]
'Hey!'

15:18.352 --> 15:21.181
What's going on?

15:21.268 --> 15:23.661
Nothing. Let's keep walking.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.847
Hey, Lisbon.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.458
What'd you get
for me, Bernie?

15:37.545 --> 15:40.374
You wanted a Zeta,
I got you one. Luis Osorio.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.463
A lieutenant, connected,
should know stuff.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.900
- I owe you one. Thanks.
- Yeah, maybe not.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.990
The charge I got Osorio on
is bogus, and he knows it

15:48.077 --> 15:51.298
so he'll keep his mouth shut.
His lawyer gets here, he walks.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.864
I like my chances.

16:00.133 --> 16:03.136
Hi, Mr. Osorio.
Uh, Patrick Jane.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.225
'Sorry we've kept you so long.'

16:05.312 --> 16:08.141
Promise we won't
keep you much longer.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.969
[sighs]

16:10.056 --> 16:12.580
You play cards?

16:12.667 --> 16:15.017
'Want to play a little game?'

16:15.104 --> 16:18.542
It's find the queen. Alright?

16:18.629 --> 16:22.894
There she is there.
All you have to do is find her.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.028
You follow the queen, you keep
an eye on where she goes

16:26.115 --> 16:29.466
and then you bet.
There. Not here. There she is.

16:29.553 --> 16:32.078
[cards clack]

16:32.165 --> 16:33.993
Where is she?

16:34.080 --> 16:37.083
I don't give a damn
where she is.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.649
[Patrick]
Hmm.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.738
What do you think I am?
A child?

16:40.825 --> 16:43.698
Excuse me. I was just trying
to kill a little time.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.485
[clacking]

16:50.226 --> 16:52.402
- Where is she?
- 'She's on the right.'

16:56.885 --> 16:59.844
- Hmm. How you do that?
- The hype.

16:59.931 --> 17:03.500
You pick up two cards
between your fingers like so

17:03.587 --> 17:05.111
but when you throw down

17:05.198 --> 17:07.852
it appears that you throw
the bottom card

17:07.939 --> 17:09.941
when in fact,
you throw the top card..

17:10.029 --> 17:14.511
Like that. See how that looked
like it was the bottom card?

17:14.598 --> 17:16.470
Huh. Nice.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.908
You hold it like that, you just
drop it down there like that.

17:19.995 --> 17:23.085
'It's very easy.
Lot of practice.'

17:23.172 --> 17:25.870
It's fun to watch, when you
know what's happening, isn't it?

17:25.957 --> 17:28.917
Kind of relaxing. Soothing.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.138
[cards clacking]

17:32.225 --> 17:34.966
Tell me something.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.491
You think the Zetas
killed Gabriel Porchetto?

17:37.578 --> 17:41.016
Nah. Zetas didn't have
any reason to kill him.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.453
Not yet, anyhow.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.542
Man was all talk.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.370
Good to know.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.329
Alright, you try.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.680
'Go ahead.'

17:54.247 --> 17:55.683
[rustle]

17:55.770 --> 17:57.250
Look at you.
You're a natural.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.426
Look at the way
you hold those cards.

17:59.513 --> 18:03.256
'And you drop the first one
down, just like that.'

18:03.343 --> 18:04.953
Two hands, let it flop.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.651
That's a beginning,
that's a start. Baby steps.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.829
Who do you think
killed Porchetto?

18:11.916 --> 18:14.658
Well, people say, uh..

18:14.745 --> 18:18.532
...he got into a fight
with a biker..

18:18.619 --> 18:21.448
biker named Wood. Ha.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.190
Almost have it. Almost.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.453
You can swindle people
before you behead them

18:26.540 --> 18:30.631
or whatever it is
you do to them.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.068
I never beheaded nobody.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.723
Slit a few throats maybe.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.856
Okay. Zero beheadings.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.771
Hmm.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.512
[Cho]
'Ran the biker named Wood.'

18:42.599 --> 18:45.167
There's an incident report
on a bar fight Junior had

18:45.254 --> 18:47.735
with a gang member named
Elwood Spiller two weeks ago.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.650
No arrest. Spiller refused
to press charges.

18:49.737 --> 18:52.174
- Find out what it was about.
- Boss, check this out.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.263
Nothing from the gas stations
in the area

18:54.350 --> 18:56.787
but I found some video cameras
near the crime scene

18:56.874 --> 18:58.354
some professor studying
animal migration patterns.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.227
One of them caught a white male
driving near the cabin

19:01.314 --> 19:02.402
right after the shooting.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.925
Did they get the plate?

19:04.012 --> 19:06.319
'No, but we were able
to enhance the image.'

19:06.406 --> 19:08.582
Asked the FBI to run it
through facial recognition

19:08.669 --> 19:10.888
and this one
seemed like the best shot.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.674
Raynor Marquette. He's from L.A.
He's got a long sheet.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.458
FBI thinks
he runs guns into Tijuana

19:15.545 --> 19:17.243
and that
he's a killer for hire.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.332
See if you can find out
anything else

19:19.419 --> 19:21.595
and send that picture
to the county sheriff's office.

19:21.682 --> 19:24.075
Okay. Hey.
You, uh, hear anything?

19:24.163 --> 19:27.122
They've covered 40%
of the search area. Nothing yet.

19:29.516 --> 19:30.473
[water trickling]

19:30.560 --> 19:32.040
So where are you from?

19:32.127 --> 19:33.476
Barstow.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.609
A cousin of my mom's
raised me.

19:35.696 --> 19:38.220
Meth head. Not so great
with the mother thing.

19:38.307 --> 19:40.527
She got me started
in this massage parlor.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.573
I was, like, 11, maybe.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.099
I wasn't the youngest.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.276
Anyways,
a couple years after

19:50.363 --> 19:52.495
this Guatemalan arms dealer
bought me..

19:52.582 --> 19:55.585
...and I was, like, his pet.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.675
And that was
kind of weird.

19:58.762 --> 20:02.984
And then he got k..
Ow!

20:03.071 --> 20:05.029
- Are you okay?
- No!

20:05.116 --> 20:07.206
Bitch, take these off.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.079
Like I'm gonna run. Where?

20:11.166 --> 20:13.124
I have no idea where we are

20:13.212 --> 20:15.649
or how to get to where
you say we're going.

20:15.736 --> 20:18.129
'Last thing I'm gonna do
is take off.'

20:23.309 --> 20:24.484
Alright.

20:24.571 --> 20:25.789
Thank you.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.922
It'll be dark soon.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.490
We need to find a place
to spend the night.

20:30.577 --> 20:33.144
Um..

20:33.232 --> 20:36.409
Shouldn't there be people out
looking for us? Where arethey?

20:36.496 --> 20:39.020
I don't know. Come on.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.630
Come on.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.680
[whirring]

20:56.559 --> 20:59.258
Elwood Spiller.
Kimball Cho, CBI.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.303
I want to talk
about Junior Porchetto.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.784
Did you and he
have a fight on the 17th?

21:03.871 --> 21:05.525
No, we did not.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.048
Well, according to
the incident report

21:07.135 --> 21:08.832
you got into an argument
with Junior

21:08.919 --> 21:11.922
and he had three of his guys
beat you to a pulp.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.837
- Nope.
- Well, how'd all this happen?

21:13.924 --> 21:17.101
- A boating accident.
- Now junior did this to you.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.886
Now you must have
a major grudge.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.715
We can talk about it here,
or I'll take you in

21:21.802 --> 21:24.457
you can sit in a cell
and talk about it tomorrow.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.676
Old man Porchetto
is on a hunt.

21:26.763 --> 21:30.201
Anybody he thinks had anything
to do with hitting Junior

21:30.289 --> 21:31.681
is gonna get clipped.

21:31.768 --> 21:36.207
So you can take me
wherever you'd like.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.906
All I'm saying

21:38.993 --> 21:41.996
is Junior Porchetto
was one hell of a guy

21:42.083 --> 21:44.172
and he always
treated me good.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.567
[sighs]

21:50.918 --> 21:53.573
You do know
his old man is sick, right?

21:54.530 --> 21:58.142
When he dies, come back.

21:58.229 --> 22:00.057
I might say
something different.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.669
Interesting.

22:02.756 --> 22:05.454
He said, come back
after the father's dead.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.064
That's right.

22:07.151 --> 22:08.414
That's interesting.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.981
We know killing Junior
was a major play.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.766
Whoever did it
took a big risk.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.594
Must've expected a big payoff.
Who's that?

22:14.681 --> 22:16.857
Hard to say. According to
the organized crime unit

22:16.944 --> 22:18.902
the main person who benefits
from Junior's death

22:18.989 --> 22:20.513
- is old man Porchetto himself.
- Why?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.602
Well, if they moved in
after Zeta territory

22:22.689 --> 22:25.126
the way that Junior wanted,
they would've started a war.

22:25.213 --> 22:26.432
Could've ended
the Porchetto organization.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.434
Junior was getting in
way over his head.

22:28.521 --> 22:31.001
[cell phone rings]

22:31.088 --> 22:34.265
It's the sheriff's office.
Lisbon.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.618
Okay, thank you.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.446
They're suspending the search
for the night.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.230
They're gonna start again
in the morning.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.449
They're doing something wrong.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.451
They should've
found her by now.

22:45.538 --> 22:48.541
They're doing something wrong.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.499
Um, either of you play squash?

22:50.586 --> 22:51.979
[Lisbon]
'What?'

22:52.066 --> 22:53.110
You know, squash.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.809
- No.
- No.

22:55.896 --> 22:59.508
I need a squash ball.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.249
It's about that big
little, black thing.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.251
Doesn't bounce very well.

23:13.043 --> 23:16.786
I know what you want to ask.
Don't be embarrassed.

23:16.873 --> 23:19.876
I am not talking to you.

23:19.963 --> 23:23.706
You are just a figment
of my imagination.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.839
Please yourself.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.064
Did you love me?

23:34.151 --> 23:35.370
Of course I loved you.

23:35.457 --> 23:38.417
Then why did you
try to kill me?

23:38.504 --> 23:41.463
I had to make a choice
between you and Red John.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.596
We all have to make
hard choices, Grace

23:43.683 --> 23:45.815
Doesn't make me evil.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.426
[scoffs]
Kind of does.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.644
Grace

23:48.731 --> 23:51.038
I was just too stupid
to see it.

23:51.125 --> 23:53.083
- Oh, no, you saw it.
- No, I didn't.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.651
Not all of it, but you knew
there was something..

23:55.738 --> 23:59.176
something a little dangerous
under the nice guy stuff.

23:59.263 --> 24:02.266
You kind of liked it.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.312
You can't open your eyes
a little bit.

24:04.399 --> 24:07.358
Gotta open 'em all the way
if you wanna see the truth.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.318
What are you talking about?

24:10.405 --> 24:14.017
Why are you doing this
to me?

24:14.104 --> 24:16.585
How should I know?

24:16.672 --> 24:20.371
I'm just a figment
of your imagination.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.497
Damn it.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.108
[whispers]
Hey.

25:01.195 --> 25:02.849
Did you find
your squash ball?

25:02.936 --> 25:06.243
Oh, yes, I did,
as a matter of fact. Thank you.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.984
Um, I'm headed over
to the Porchettos.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.290
Why?

25:09.377 --> 25:11.510
It probably won't work,
but if it does

25:11.597 --> 25:15.905
you're gonna have to move fast,
so stay on your toes.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.820
Boss. They're looking
in the wrong place.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.953
- What do you mean?
- The searchers messed up.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.520
That's why they haven't
found anything.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.044
They started the search
at the last cell phone tower

25:24.131 --> 25:25.872
that Van Pelt's phone
made contact with.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.657
They figured she was within
a 15-mile radius of this point.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.703
- That makes sense.
- But they're wrong. I checked.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.009
The next tower, here, was down
for maintenance yesterday.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.490
If her phone tried to make
contact with thistower

25:35.577 --> 25:36.752
there'd be no record.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.537
They should be looking
10 miles further.

25:38.624 --> 25:39.799
I'm going out there.

25:39.886 --> 25:42.497
You go.
I'll deal with Wainwright.

25:42.584 --> 25:46.457
[cell phone rings]

25:46.545 --> 25:47.589
Hey, sir.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.418
Wayne, hi.
Um, I know you're busy.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.768
I was just wondering
how things are.

25:52.855 --> 25:55.510
We still haven't found her
yet. I'm heading out there.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.818
Um, well, I just want you to
know I was thinking about you

25:58.905 --> 26:01.124
and praying for Grace,
and..

26:01.211 --> 26:04.388
I just know that this is
gonna turn out alright.

26:04.475 --> 26:05.955
Thanks.
Listen, I have to go.

26:06.042 --> 26:09.350
The, uh, elevator's here.
I'll call you later, yeah?

26:12.005 --> 26:13.920
Janpen?!

26:14.007 --> 26:16.226
Janpen?!

26:16.313 --> 26:17.663
Don't blame yourself.

26:17.750 --> 26:18.751
I fell asleep.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.230
Yeah. You were tired.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.797
She gets lost,
she could die.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.843
Why did I think
I could stay awake?

26:23.930 --> 26:24.887
Everything isn't your fault.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.280
This is my fault.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.108
- I wasn't your fault.
- Yes, you were.

26:28.195 --> 26:31.372
You were with me when you killed
those cops and you shot Lisbon.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.113
I should have stopped you.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.855
You did.
You killed me.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.552
I was too late.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.773
I should have seen it sooner.
I should have done something.

26:40.860 --> 26:44.124
How? You were in love with me.
Don't you remember?

26:48.476 --> 26:51.871
There she is.

26:54.177 --> 26:57.180
- Where'd you go?
- I had to pee.

26:57.267 --> 26:59.922
Who were you talking to?

27:00.009 --> 27:02.142
- Nobody.
- Great.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.535
Lost in the woods
with a crazy cop.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.102
Hey, I got it worse.

27:06.189 --> 27:09.540
I'm lost in the woods
with a grumpy hooker. Let's go.

27:16.591 --> 27:20.900
The silent intimidation act
is quite effective.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.032
I'll admit, I'm intimidated.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.339
Then he forced himself in here,
and won't leave.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.863
- You have to do something--
- Iris. You need to relax.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.212
Tension causes wrinkles.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.040
Mr. Jane,
what are you doing here?

27:31.127 --> 27:33.782
- I need to speak to Porchetto.
- You can't talk to him.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.566
Yes, I can.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.612
Do you see what I mean?
This is...

27:37.699 --> 27:41.137
If you don't leave,
I'll protest to your superiors.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.009
You can't harass my client
like this.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.881
How long have you two been
carrying on this affair?

27:45.968 --> 27:47.491
What do you mean?

27:47.578 --> 27:50.016
Your protectiveness of Iris
is more than legal

27:50.103 --> 27:53.715
and she keeps touching your
elbow. Hard to misinterpret.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.978
I'm pretty sure
Curtis here already knows.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.894
Yes, he looks dense,
but he's as sharp as a tack.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.941
Doesn't miss a beat,
do you, Curtis?

28:02.028 --> 28:04.900
This is...
completely irrelevant.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.902
Are you worried
that Porchetto's gonna find out

28:06.989 --> 28:08.817
or does it add
a more excitement?

28:08.904 --> 28:11.341
- Did you just threaten us?
- Let's take a breath here.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.387
[Porchetto]
'What's going on?'

28:13.474 --> 28:14.562
You.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.346
Well, good morning.

28:16.433 --> 28:20.350
That trick, one two, one two...
damned if it doesn't work.

28:20.437 --> 28:23.136
- Fell asleep in no time.
- Glad to hear it.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.268
What do you want?

28:25.355 --> 28:27.618
Do you think we could
talk someplace else?

28:27.706 --> 28:30.970
It's kind of
a private matter.

28:40.196 --> 28:43.460
So what is it?

28:44.853 --> 28:47.290
Well, colleague of mine
is missing.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.597
I think it's connected
to your son's murder.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.425
You're still looking
for the murderer, right?

28:51.512 --> 28:52.774
Maybe.

28:52.861 --> 28:54.863
Sure you are.
You want to kill him.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.517
I get it, believe me.

28:56.604 --> 29:00.260
But have you found him?
'Cause I'd like to talk to him

29:00.347 --> 29:03.306
Then you can have him back,
Do whatever you want with him.

29:03.393 --> 29:04.873
I don't know
anything about it.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.440
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.268
Crap.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.052
You were my last hope.

29:10.139 --> 29:14.187
Okay. What do I do now?
I could use a drink. Um...

29:16.189 --> 29:18.147
You don't have any vodka,
do you?

29:18.234 --> 29:21.237
I can't have booze around.
My meds.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.543
Surely, you got a stash.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.588
A man like you
would have a stash.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.982
I only want a nip, just..
Maybe two.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.811
Really craving that
warm, comforting feeling

29:29.898 --> 29:31.900
of alcohol hitting
the back of your throat.

29:31.987 --> 29:36.513
You know.
It just levels me.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.907
Uh, don't tell my wife.

29:54.227 --> 29:57.404
Mm. Love that sound.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.321
You're a saint.
Thank you.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.323
[sniffs and sighs]

30:03.410 --> 30:06.587
Mmm.

30:06.674 --> 30:09.285
Mmm.

30:09.982 --> 30:12.854
Mmm.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.030
[sighs]

30:15.117 --> 30:17.816
Yep, that's it.
Just levels me.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.601
It's like an angel
crying on your tongue.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.168
[sighs]

30:22.255 --> 30:23.778
That's good.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.867
You?

30:25.954 --> 30:28.696
Doctors say it messes me up.

30:28.783 --> 30:32.004
Oh, them. Doctors.
Always with the rules.

30:32.091 --> 30:35.268
I mean, as if they know
anything for sure.

30:36.269 --> 30:37.923
One.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.579
[pours vodka]

30:48.977 --> 30:50.674
Ah.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.852
[exhales deeply]

30:53.939 --> 30:56.419
So Mike has a...

30:56.506 --> 30:59.640
pool cue, and, uh...

30:59.727 --> 31:01.207
Cheers.
[glasses clink]

31:01.294 --> 31:04.775
Cheers. And sammy's
right behind me..

31:04.863 --> 31:07.517
and, uh..

31:07.604 --> 31:09.737
and I have a shovel.
He says...

31:09.824 --> 31:11.608
[grunts]

31:11.695 --> 31:13.001
[glass clinks]

31:22.445 --> 31:24.970
Man down! Man down in here!

31:25.057 --> 31:26.841
What the hell happened?

31:26.928 --> 31:28.799
He just fell off.
I don't know.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.672
Does he have a pulse?
Check.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.108
I don't feel anything.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.675
- Let me check.
- Oh, my God.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.504
Is he breathing? I can't
tell if he's breathing.

31:37.591 --> 31:40.072
- I'm not getting a pulse.
- I don't think he's breathing.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.509
Is this it? Is this happening?
Oh, my God.

31:42.596 --> 31:45.381
- Someone call an ambulance!
- I'll call right now.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.470
What should we do?
We should do something.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.037
I'll get the guys.

31:49.124 --> 31:51.344
We can't just leave him here.
It's so undignified.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.650
Do you have somewhere
you can lay him down?

31:53.737 --> 31:56.088
- 'In the front room.'
- Front room it is, then.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.699
- Guys. Come on, come on!
- I need a hand here.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.548
Porchetto's dead?

32:21.635 --> 32:22.941
Oh, more like drunk.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.116
Are you drunk?

32:24.203 --> 32:25.769
A little.
Let's not get distracted.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.815
[whispers]
I think someone is
staging a coup

32:27.902 --> 32:29.686
inside the Porchetto family

32:29.773 --> 32:31.688
a takeover
when the old man dies.

32:31.775 --> 32:33.386
- That's who killed Junior.
- Why?

32:33.473 --> 32:36.084
Because Junior wanted
to go to war with the zetas--

32:36.171 --> 32:37.999
would have destroyed
the family

32:38.086 --> 32:39.653
before the plotter
could take over.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.177
So you're trying to get
the plotter to reveal himself

32:42.264 --> 32:44.310
by pretending
that Porchetto's dead?

32:44.397 --> 32:46.355
Oh, you're very good,
grasshopper.

32:46.442 --> 32:48.401
Won't the doctors
figure out he's not dead?

32:48.488 --> 32:51.186
They're figuring it out now.
so we have to work fast.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.492
But Van Pelt is missing.

32:52.579 --> 32:53.972
- Excuse me, doctor?
- Yes.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.017
My name's Patrick Jane.
I'm with the CBI.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.106
Do you take bribe money
from big pharma?

32:58.193 --> 33:00.979
What?

33:01.066 --> 33:03.677
That's an offensive suggestion.
Why would you say that?

33:03.764 --> 33:04.983
Well, a lot of doctors...

33:05.070 --> 33:08.421
what's he saying?

33:08.508 --> 33:11.424
I mean, obviously,
in any profession

33:11.511 --> 33:14.905
people fall short
of the ethical mark.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.733
What's that doctor
saying to the cop?

33:16.820 --> 33:18.779
Mm, free trips
to the Bahamas...

33:18.866 --> 33:20.824
Think it's about dad?

33:20.911 --> 33:24.176
Well, thanks for chatting.

33:27.222 --> 33:28.919
What was that doctor saying?

33:29.007 --> 33:30.791
Well, he should probably
tell you himself.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.836
It's not really my place.

33:32.923 --> 33:36.623
Mr. Jane, people are suffering.
Tell us what you know.

33:36.710 --> 33:39.669
We're very sorry
for your loss.

33:39.756 --> 33:43.543
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. He's gone.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.240
Son of a bitch.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.764
Can't help but feel
a little responsible here.

33:47.851 --> 33:49.375
- What'd you do to him?
- Serge.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.203
You were the last one
with him.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.466
If I find out
you did anything to him

33:53.553 --> 33:55.511
I swear you're gonna die.
You hear me?

33:55.598 --> 33:58.471
It's not a threat.
It's a promise.

33:58.558 --> 34:01.430
Shut... up.
Alright?

34:01.517 --> 34:03.171
You can't say that to me.

34:03.258 --> 34:05.173
You work for me.
I'm in charge now.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.088
No, you're not.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.047
I am.

34:09.134 --> 34:13.051
I talked to the crews,
all of them. They're with me.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.401
And we're gonna do this
smooth and smart

34:15.488 --> 34:17.577
and we're not gonna
go around threatening cops

34:17.664 --> 34:19.709
in public places.
Got it?

34:19.796 --> 34:21.276
- But you have--
- No.

34:21.363 --> 34:22.973
No, he's right. Wait.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.672
- We will talk at the house.
- You're in charge now?

34:25.759 --> 34:27.282
This is none of your business.

34:27.369 --> 34:30.894
You need to speak
with us alone.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.113
[chuckles]
Right.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.637
You really do.

34:36.161 --> 34:39.077
Wait here.

34:42.776 --> 34:45.431
So?

34:49.609 --> 34:51.567
- What the hell?
- It's an old trick.

34:51.654 --> 34:54.962
Small ball under the arm
stops the blood flowing.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.138
No pulse.

34:58.922 --> 35:01.751
He's alive. That's great.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.188
Not for you.

35:03.275 --> 35:05.407
You hired Raynor Marquette
to kill Junior

35:05.494 --> 35:07.888
because he was getting
in your way, didn't you?

35:07.975 --> 35:09.542
Good luck proving that.

35:09.629 --> 35:13.241
I don't have to prove it
in court. I'll just tell him.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.120
Don't do that.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.904
'I will if I have to.'

35:23.991 --> 35:26.428
'I think Marquette's
put one of my people in danger.'

35:26.515 --> 35:28.648
You're gonna
help us find him...

35:28.735 --> 35:32.130
or I will take you in there
and sign your death warrant.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.219
I think she means it.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.091
We got Marquette's cell phone.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.659
We were able to track it
to state route 4

35:39.746 --> 35:41.182
14 miles east
of Porchetto's cabin.

35:41.269 --> 35:42.488
He must be somewhere nearby.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.054
Yeah, it's pretty close
to here.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.319
I can get some rangers
to meet me there. Thanks.

35:47.406 --> 35:50.278
So do you ever think
about getting out of

35:50.365 --> 35:52.280
you know, sex work?

35:52.367 --> 35:54.369
What kind of car you got?

35:54.456 --> 35:56.719
Piece of crap, I bet.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.548
I drive a Lexus,
fully loaded.

35:59.635 --> 36:00.593
Oh, excuse me.

36:00.680 --> 36:01.768
[chuckles]

36:01.855 --> 36:03.291
There's more to life
than that.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.206
[crack]

36:05.293 --> 36:07.295
Get down.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.950
Stay here.
Don't make a sound.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.697
[gunshots]

36:23.703 --> 36:25.531
Grace Behind you.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.402
[grunting]

36:35.802 --> 36:37.195
Stop.

36:37.282 --> 36:40.589
- Get... off!
- Just... relax.

36:43.331 --> 36:46.247
So I guess we can
call it even now, huh?

36:48.118 --> 36:49.816
Bye, Grace

36:49.903 --> 36:52.514
Look after yourself.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.344
[Rigsby]
'Grace!
Where are you?!'

36:56.431 --> 37:01.436
Over here!

37:01.523 --> 37:02.742
You okay?

37:02.829 --> 37:05.875
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.052
[door closes]

37:13.666 --> 37:16.146
This is your chance to do
something for yourself, Janpen.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.584
Marquette's still in the
hospital. You talk first

37:18.671 --> 37:22.022
the D.A. Will take first-degree
murder off the table.

37:25.068 --> 37:28.028
No death penalty.
You want that?

37:34.426 --> 37:37.603
Marquette and I are a team.

37:37.690 --> 37:41.215
Part of the job is
getting closer to the target.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.043
'That's what I do.'

37:52.226 --> 37:54.228
Nett had planted the gun.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.709
[Cho]
'Nett grabbed the gun
when he came out.'

37:56.796 --> 38:00.669
He took it to the fence.
Raynor was waiting.

38:00.756 --> 38:04.543
'We had to make it look like the
shooter came from the outside.'

38:04.630 --> 38:06.719
'That was nett's thing.'

38:06.806 --> 38:08.808
He was terrified
old man Porchetto

38:08.895 --> 38:11.463
would find out
he was behind it.

38:11.550 --> 38:15.815
When I was sleeping, you found
a cell signal, didn't you?

38:15.902 --> 38:18.383
That's how Marquette found us.
You called him.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.472
Just wanted to get out
of there.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.300
- By killing me.
- Oh.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.563
Well, it wasn't personal.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.042
Come on.

38:26.129 --> 38:28.958
I kind of like you. You know,
you're hardcore.

38:29.045 --> 38:32.266
I respect that.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.747
Let's go.

38:49.239 --> 38:50.197
Hey.

38:50.284 --> 38:53.113
Hey.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.898
How are you feeling?

38:55.985 --> 38:59.293
Better. Okay.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.686
Come here.

39:00.773 --> 39:02.862
[sighs]

39:03.732 --> 39:05.560
[Sarah]
'Hi.'

39:05.647 --> 39:09.347
Oh, hey.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.131
I heard you got back
alright.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.263
Yep. Safe and sound.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.571
Congratulations.
It's just such great news.

39:16.658 --> 39:17.920
I'll see you tomorrow,
Wayne.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.531
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

39:19.618 --> 39:20.619
Excuse me.

39:25.232 --> 39:26.973
You want to get
something to eat?

39:27.060 --> 39:30.759
Yeah. Absolutely.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.678
I'm sorry
if that was uncomfortable.

39:36.765 --> 39:41.117
It didn't mean anything.
Really. Nothing at all.

39:41.204 --> 39:44.251
No, it's okay.
Wayne, I understand.

39:48.255 --> 39:50.518
So... how have you been?

39:50.605 --> 39:53.347
Good. Fine.

39:53.434 --> 39:56.655
I'm pregnant.

40:14.890 --> 40:15.848
Jane?

40:15.935 --> 40:17.719
Mm-hmm.

40:17.806 --> 40:20.679
I'm sorry to ask this,
but..

40:20.766 --> 40:24.465
do you ever talk
to your wife?

40:24.552 --> 40:26.859
Yes, sometimes.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.469
Do you ever see her?

40:28.556 --> 40:30.428
No, never.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.082
If you did see her..

40:33.169 --> 40:34.736
...would you think
you were crazy?

40:34.823 --> 40:38.348
Ah.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.612
Craig came to see you,
didn't he?

40:40.699 --> 40:41.787
Yeah.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.746
What did he want?

40:44.833 --> 40:47.575
I don't know.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.535
This will sound
really weird, but..

40:50.622 --> 40:52.450
...he kind of saved my life.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.364
Figuratively speaking,
I hope.

40:54.452 --> 40:58.499
Yes. I mean, he wasn't...
really there, but..

40:58.586 --> 41:00.762
You can't decide what to do
with the necklace

41:00.849 --> 41:05.245
because it reminds you
of your past.

41:05.332 --> 41:07.639
You can try to forget it..

41:07.726 --> 41:09.989
...or you can learn
to live with it.

41:10.076 --> 41:11.425
Yeah.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.558
Hmm.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.257
Well?

41:17.344 --> 41:19.520
Well what?

41:19.607 --> 41:23.916
What do you think I should do?
Keep it or get rid of it?

41:29.356 --> 41:33.186
Well, I think
that's your call, Grace.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.623
Don't you?

41:36.972 --> 41:38.800
Goodnight.

41:38.887 --> 41:41.977
Goodnight, Jane.

41:44.937 --> 41:47.374
[clink]
