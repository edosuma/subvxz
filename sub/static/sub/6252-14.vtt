21:45.430 --> 21:49.719
I just didn’t want to
darken her special day...

21:49.809 --> 21:51.310
like you just did.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.726
If you’ll excuse me,
I need to speak to the caterer.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.475
- When was the last time
you saw Wendy Bovitz?
- I don’t know.

21:56.566 --> 22:00.275
- A couple days ago, I guess.
- We were told that you
went to her house.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.397
Yeah. I like to do business
face to face.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.150
And there was
a heated exchange
face to face?

22:05.241 --> 22:08.074
She was going over budget.
She was taking advantage of me.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.698
She was promising Raina
some sort of crazy-ass
expensive orchids.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.870
ldonWer
to be taken advantage of.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.615
Look, I’m sorry
Wendy’s dead,

22:15.710 --> 22:17.621
but I’m getting
married tonight.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.249
Can we do all this after?

22:20.381 --> 22:23.999
Sweetheart, go play with your
dress, or whatever you women do
before you get hitched.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.635
I hate you.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.262
- So, sounds like
I need a lawyer.
- [Cell Phone Rings]

22:33.394 --> 22:36.352
Yeah, you do.
Brennan.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.976
I did a closer examination
of the fractured fingers
you discovered.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.150
One showed a dislocation
at the articular capsule.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.485
Indicating a struggle.
Exact/y

22:44.572 --> 22:48.235
And Dr. Saroyan
found epithelial cells
under one of the fingernails.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.282
Enough for
a DNA. profile?

22:50.370 --> 22:53.282
Yeah. She just needs
a suspect to compare it to.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.284
Okay, thanks.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.117
I’m going to need
a DNA. sample,
Mr. Erickson.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.202
I just need to swab
the inside of your cheek.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.083
You do see I’m looking
at you now, right?

23:03.174 --> 23:06.666
Yes. And, in fact,
I can see my reflection
on your cornea.

23:06.761 --> 23:10.345
Good. Then let’s be clear.
That’s never, ever gonna happen.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.892
All right.
Okay, thanks.
[ Beeps ]

23:19.983 --> 23:21.974
You want
the good news first
or the bad news?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.979
Is the order
at all relevant?

23:24.070 --> 23:27.312
People like to get the bad news
first so the conversation
ends in happiness.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.318
All right, then,
what’s the bad news?

23:29.409 --> 23:33.778
The court refuses to compel
a DNA. sample from Erickson
based on what we have so far.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.658
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- Do you mind?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.910
- It-It’s not work-related.
- Go right ahead.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.579
Brennan.
I’ll be right here.

23:40.670 --> 23:43.127
[ Chuckles ]
Uh, for Valentine’s Day?

23:43.214 --> 23:45.296
Oh. Oh, Valentine’s Day, eh?

23:45.425 --> 23:48.758
A secret service agent
from my gym.
Of course.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.131
[Laughs]
No, uh, it’s not
my mother.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.050
Whoa.
He thinks that
you’re my mother.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.844
Okay, look,
I’m not her mother.
Okay, I don’t have a mother.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.302
Could I phone you back
to tell you no? Thanks.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.433
All right,
what’s the good news...

24:01.524 --> 24:04.357
so that we may
end this conversation
on a happy note?

24:04.444 --> 24:06.935
Erickson has a son in prison
for insider trading.

24:07.030 --> 24:10.272
Why is that good news?
It seems the entire family
is degenerate.

24:10.366 --> 24:13.574
Bones, it’s good news because
it means the son’s DNA.
is on file with CODIS.

24:13.661 --> 24:17.825
Right. So, Cam can compare it
to the sample from the victim’s
fingernails...

24:17.915 --> 24:21.499
and see if there are
sufficient alleles in common
to match his dad.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.372
See? Always start
with the bad news first,
then go to the good news.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.578
- You happy now?
- It’s good news.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.295
You happy?
I’m happy.

24:27.717 --> 24:28.957
Hey. l’m checking—

24:29.052 --> 24:30.383
I know.
Ticktock, ticktock.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.507
Could you tell Dr. Saroyan
that I am going
as fast as I can?

24:33.598 --> 24:36.761
You can assure her
that my ass
is indeed moving.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.760
Yeah. I guess we’re just
all a little on edge.
Yeah.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.933
I’m casting a mold
of the bone damage
to determine the murder weapon.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.309
How long
is that gonna take?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.686
Longer than it’s gonna
take Dr. Hodgins...

24:46.778 --> 24:48.689
to analyze the weapon’s
chemical composition...

24:48.780 --> 24:52.614
from the micro-slice of bone
I removed at the terminus.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.533
Right. So you want me
to leave and hurry along
Hodgins rather than you?

24:55.620 --> 24:57.156
Yes.

24:57.246 --> 25:00.033
But could I ask
a personal question first?

25:01.542 --> 25:03.078
Absolutely.

25:03.169 --> 25:07.128
Okay, you’re a woman
with a very open mind.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.383
Is this
gonna get creepy?
No, no.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.295
Absolutely not.
Ihope.
Okay.

25:11.386 --> 25:14.799
Okay, look. Nora sent me
a text with a request
for Valentine’s Day.

25:14.889 --> 25:19.474
Oh. You’re wondering whether
I can cover for you so you can
go and pick up the gift, right?

25:19.602 --> 25:24.016
No. If Cam finds out about this,
Clark, I could get the rack.
No, no, I’m not going anywhere.

25:24.107 --> 25:27.474
The request wasn’t
for something that I could
go buy or reserve or—

25:27.568 --> 25:30.025
Oh, really?
Well, I’m intrigued.

25:30.113 --> 25:35.358
It’s the first time I have
ever felt hesitant about
giving Nora what she wants.

25:36.327 --> 25:39.194
Can I say no?
I never have before.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.492
Is it illegal?
No, of course not.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.786
Will it hurt?
Good God, no.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.955
And you love her?
More than anything.

25:47.046 --> 25:51.881
Well, then show her.
I guarantee you that’s the
only thing she really wants.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.876
So what is it?

25:56.222 --> 25:58.258
Thank you for all your help,
Ms. Montenegro.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.387
[Beeps]

26:10.027 --> 26:11.688
Erickson
is a self-made man.

26:11.779 --> 26:14.191
Never finished high school.
Took courses in welding.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.193
Built his business
from the ground up.

26:16.284 --> 26:19.151
Now he is the leading
supplier of shelving
on the eastern seaboard.

26:19.287 --> 26:22.199
That’s very impressive.
Yeah, but the thing
about self-made men...

26:22.290 --> 26:25.578
is that they’re often
extremely insecure
and egomaniacal.

26:25.710 --> 26:28.793
Right.
That means that they can
be really self-defensive.

26:28.921 --> 26:32.413
They want everyone to do
exactly what they say.
Like, kill them when they don’t?

26:32.508 --> 26:36.000
He lacks compassion.
He tends to fire employees once
they reach a certain pay grade.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.006
All right, Sweets,
did he kill her?

26:38.097 --> 26:40.008
His daughter’s wedding.
Lots of tension.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.011
Yeah. Yeah, a man like Erickson
could snap under
that kind of pressure.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.967
What are you doing
for Valentine’s?

26:45.062 --> 26:46.927
What does that have
to do with anything?

26:47.064 --> 26:48.975
Nothing.
Just being friendly.
Yeah, well, don’t be.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.353
That’s nice.
And a good afternoon
to you too. Enjoy.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.481
Bouquet of daisies.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.237
What is it?

27:00.328 --> 27:04.116
At first, like you,
I thought it was some sort
of winged insect, right?

27:04.207 --> 27:05.913
Maybe a butterfly.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.581
What is it?

27:07.668 --> 27:10.831
But then I determined
it was flora, not fauna.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.830
What is it?
It’s Ono/diam.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.877
What is it?
Why do you keep
saying that?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.549
Because you won’t
tell me what it is.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.049
It’s an orchid blossom.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.675
So she was wearing
an orchid in her hair?

27:21.766 --> 27:24.974
Certainly a possibility.
But she also could’ve been
smacked on the head.

27:25.102 --> 27:28.344
With an orchid?
I’m guessing,
so don’t tell Dr. Brennan,

27:28.439 --> 27:32.148
but the father of the bride
was furious when the
flower budget was exceeded.

27:32.235 --> 27:34.772
And these Ono/diam,
they cost, baby.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.853
And by “baby,”
I mean “Dr. Saroyan.”

27:37.949 --> 27:42.283
So you’re saying
the father of the bride got mad,
tossed an orchid at her,

27:42.370 --> 27:45.282
then stabbed her,
then shoved her
into the tanning bed?

27:45.373 --> 27:47.238
I can see it.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.665
Could happen.
Good.
Now one other thing.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.663
Everything I get Angela
is wrong.
What do I do?

27:51.754 --> 27:53.665
Dr. Hodgins,
we’ve got a deadline.

27:53.756 --> 27:57.044
Yeah, and your deadline
for Valentine’s is the
exact same as my deadline.

27:57.134 --> 28:00.797
Now, I am doing everything
I can to help you make your
deadline for Valentine’s.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.424
Why won’t you help me?

28:02.515 --> 28:04.676
Look at me.
I’m desperate here.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.391
You’re right.
Thank you.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.682
Thank you.
[Sighs]

28:11.774 --> 28:14.766
Dr. Hodgins,
look around you.

28:14.860 --> 28:19.194
I mean, you may have
the most beautiful room
in the Jeffersonian,

28:19.282 --> 28:22.649
aside from
the molds and fungis
and creepy-crawlies.

28:22.743 --> 28:27.077
Are you telling me that
there isn’t something here
that you’ve worked on...

28:27.164 --> 28:28.904
that wouldn’t
make a great gift?

28:30.126 --> 28:33.038
Are you just
trying to get me
to stay at work?

28:33.129 --> 28:36.963
Dr. Saroyan,
I think there’s something
you’re gonna want to see.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.667
I am insulted
that you would think
I’m so self-serving.

28:44.557 --> 28:48.015
This might help get you
outta here very quickly.
Sounds good. I’m ready.

28:48.102 --> 28:51.344
I came in looking for you
and couldn’t help
but look at your monitor.

28:51.439 --> 28:54.476
I see.
You’ve arranged them for me.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.274
Mm-hmm. These are
the DNA. results...

28:57.361 --> 28:59.272
of the tissue found under
the victim’s fingernails.

28:59.363 --> 29:03.902
And that’s Erickson Jr.’s
D.N.A. profile off CODIS.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.483
They match.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.489
Now, if I was as petty
as Dr. Hodgins,

29:07.580 --> 29:10.242
I would just crown myself
king of the lab.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.698
Not so fast, Dr. Edison.

29:11.834 --> 29:15.543
Bones are your thing, not D.N.A.
This is not a match.
What?

29:15.630 --> 29:20.875
The DNA. samples share
65% of their profile
at each locus,

29:20.968 --> 29:23.175
indicating that they are
immediate relatives.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.594
Yes. That’s true.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.593
Okay, that’s a
“Yes, that’s true, but”—

29:28.684 --> 29:31.892
But it’s not
the father of the bride.
It’s not Warren Erickson.

29:31.979 --> 29:36.473
The DNA. shows that
the skin under the victim’s
fingernails is female.

29:36.567 --> 29:39.183
Oh. Well, then it’s
the mother of the bride.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.940
The mother of the bride’s
been deceased for seven years.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.273
It’s the bride.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.866
I need to get dressed.
I can’t believe you people
keep ruining my wedding day.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.452
- A woman
has been murdered, Raina.
- And that’s bad. I know.

29:58.547 --> 30:02.460
But I’m still alive, and this
is supposed to be the most
wonderful day of my life!

30:02.551 --> 30:06.043
Tell you what. You can
answer our questions here,
or we can take you downtown.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.880
- It’s up to you.
- [ Sighs ]
Okay. Okay.

30:08.974 --> 30:12.137
- Ask!
- Right. Why’d you go over
to Wendy’s house?

30:12.228 --> 30:14.640
What? I didn’t.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.472
Your DNA. was found
under her fingernails.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.649
You mean that DNA. stuff
is really true?

30:22.113 --> 30:23.569
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.442
Well, I went there.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.945
She said she was
available any time
and that all she wanted...

30:28.035 --> 30:30.071
was for me to have
the most wonderful wedding
in the world.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.910
And you fought?
Yes.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.204
My dad had gone there...

30:34.291 --> 30:37.419
to tell her
to pull the orchids
and the wine.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.165
And I wanted them.
Especially those orchids.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.167
She still had the sample there.

30:42.258 --> 30:43.964
That must be how
the flower petal
got into her hair.

30:44.051 --> 30:46.337
So I told her that I didn’t
care about my dad...

30:46.429 --> 30:48.966
and she’d better find a way
to get those frickin’ orchids
on the tables or else.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.717
Or else what?

30:50.808 --> 30:52.344
Or else I would
call my father...

30:52.476 --> 30:55.092
and have him hire
a new wedding planner
and she’d never get another penny.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.554
She started screaming that
she’d already laid out thousands
and thousands of dollars,

30:58.649 --> 31:00.230
but I told her tough crap.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.932
Wow. That’s aggressive.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.689
Look, I don’t like being that way.
ltjust runs in my family.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.567
Anyway, I grabbed the phone
to call my father...

31:07.658 --> 31:10.400
and Wendy tried to
take it away from me.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.450
So we kind of got into it.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.621
I pushed her,
and she scratched me.

31:15.708 --> 31:19.075
- But we made up.
- Because you got your orchids.

31:20.254 --> 31:23.542
I know I’m a bitch,
but I am not a killer bitch.

31:27.887 --> 31:31.004
So, any information
from the Mikrosil cast
of the entry wounds?

31:31.098 --> 31:33.475
I managed to use the ribs
as well as the section
of the spine...

31:33.559 --> 31:35.299
to recreate
the wound track.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.306
Now, I took a photo
of the cast
and magnified the image.

31:38.397 --> 31:42.606
Once I had the track,
we could extrapolate
the shape of the weapon.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.901
And with Angela’s help,
we could take all the elements
that we discovered...

31:45.988 --> 31:48.730
and render a 3-D visual
of the murder weapon.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.940
- Great. What is it?
- I have no idea.

31:51.035 --> 31:52.821
Well, that’s a letdown.

31:52.953 --> 31:56.445
I checked it against
numerous databases and haven’t
found any weapons that match.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.077
The rough edges suggest
that it was hand-forged.

31:59.168 --> 32:02.752
It’d help if you could tell me
what the weapon was made from.

a little bit insulting...

I’d be available
at the last minute.

for Wendy’s business. So?

Please tell me you’re here
to arrest me for Wendy’s murder,

because I could really
use the break.

- Is that a confession, Mr. Hargrove?
- No. It was a joke.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.585
A bad joke, but a joke.

Look, Wendy was my friend,
but she was also my meal ticket.

your meal ticket left you
an even bigger meal ticket, pal.

The whole thing?

Are you aware
that she recently transferred
half the business to you?

34:36.659 --> 34:38.570
Oh, God.

34:38.661 --> 34:40.151
That seemed
very sincere.

Or he’s just probably
feeling guilty
that he killed her.

she had a surprise for me
on, uh, Valentine’s Day,

I know I seem like Jane,
but nope. All Tarzan.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.237
It’s had precisely
two advantages.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.406
One, I got laid a lot
in high school.

35:19.493 --> 35:22.860
And the other
is, uh, my career.
I’m a wedding planner.

35:22.996 --> 35:27.160
I mean, I guess I could’ve
been a choreographer,
but you have to have talent for that.

35:27.251 --> 35:29.583
So, is that why Wendy,
uh, hired you?

35:29.670 --> 35:32.332
Well, she hired me because
I’m very good at the job.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.880
But, yes,
she assumed I was gay...

we got into the champagne.

In checking
the victim’s e-mails,

36:28.103 --> 36:32.221
I found that someone else
used her computer
to check his e-mails...

36:32.316 --> 36:34.398
38 hours before
you found the body.

36:34.485 --> 36:37.318
That would have been very close
to her time of death.
Who was it?

36:37.404 --> 36:40.271
Greg Bovitz,
the victim’s estranged husband.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.946
Bovitz already admitted
to being there.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.446
But did he admit to
breaking into her computer?

36:44.536 --> 36:46.276
It couldn’t have been
someone else?

36:46.371 --> 36:48.987
Within 20 seconds of
checking his own e-mail?

36:49.124 --> 36:50.864
Did he get in?
Yep.

36:50.959 --> 36:55.703
He would’ve found that his wife
gave away half the business
to her business partner.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.762
Hey, Bones.
Oh, there you are.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.337
We found the victim’s blood
on the murder weapon,

37:05.432 --> 37:06.888
but Hodgins
found something else.

37:07.017 --> 37:09.224
Oh, what else?
An oily substance.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.184
Anything
more than that?
Take a look.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.513
“Take a look.”
Okay, I’m taking a look.

37:14.608 --> 37:19.147
Really? After all this time,
you expect me to know
what this stuff says?

37:19.238 --> 37:22.275
It’s a compound containing
neatsfoot, Stockholm tar,

37:22.366 --> 37:24.948
saligari, silicone
and eucalyptus oil.

37:25.035 --> 37:27.276
Those are all generic terms
and not at all scientific.

37:27.371 --> 37:29.487
Don’t make me beg.
What does this mean?

37:29.581 --> 37:31.446
It’s horse hoof oil.

The victim’s estranged husband
keeps horses.

37:34.044 --> 37:37.161
He-He drives brides and grooms
around in his carriage.

37:37.256 --> 37:38.837
He killed her.
Okay, I get it.

37:38.924 --> 37:42.963
But this evidence is not
enough to make an arrest,
let alone convict.

37:43.053 --> 37:45.339

he’s the only viable suspect.

is the same oil
