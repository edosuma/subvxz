My family's been

00:08.608 --> 00:10.744
in the coffee business
with our Colombian partner

00:10.746 --> 00:11.829
for 65 years.

00:13.405 --> 00:16.656
I've spent my entire adult
life avoiding coming here.

00:16.658 --> 00:17.491
And now,

00:18.911 --> 00:20.578
I don't wanna leave.

00:32.891 --> 00:33.722
Hello?

00:33.724 --> 00:34.623
Where are you?

00:34.625 --> 00:36.372
Uh, I've been stuck in traffic

00:36.374 --> 00:38.101
for the past hour and a half.

00:38.103 --> 00:39.137
What's up?

00:39.139 --> 00:42.021
Dad lost his
mind and fired B.C. Coffee.

00:42.023 --> 00:43.264
Wait, what?

00:43.266 --> 00:45.278
They're going
organic and raised their prices.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.360
Dad hung up on Mr. Hernandez.

00:48.362 --> 00:50.142
Well, we can't drop 'em.

00:50.144 --> 00:51.465
We're gonna go under.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.069
You need to go fix this.

00:53.071 --> 00:54.321
With Dad?

00:54.323 --> 00:56.278
No, you're
going down to Colombia

00:56.280 --> 00:57.595
to get them back onboard.

00:57.597 --> 00:58.581
Have Dad go.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.340
Daniel, Dad's not going.

01:00.342 --> 01:02.377
He's old and he's stubborn.

01:02.379 --> 01:04.647
I've never been to Colombia.

01:04.650 --> 01:06.090
Go home and pack.

01:06.092 --> 01:08.041
I'm gonna book you on
the next flight today

01:08.043 --> 01:10.844
and I'll text you with all the details.

01:10.846 --> 01:12.513
No, I'm not going.

01:15.659 --> 01:16.492
Maggie.

01:19.649 --> 01:20.482
Fuck.

03:02.111 --> 03:03.944
Um, I'm Daniel Miller.

03:05.031 --> 03:07.148
I'm supposed to see Mr. Hernandez.

03:07.150 --> 03:10.374
Um, and is he expecting you?

03:10.376 --> 03:11.543
Yes.

03:11.545 --> 03:13.315
Actually, he's expecting my father

03:13.317 --> 03:15.900
but my father couldn't make it.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.709
- Miller.
- Miller.

03:44.352 --> 03:46.301
He has a really busy day today,

03:46.303 --> 03:49.217
so if you want you can wait.

03:49.219 --> 03:51.516
Uh, I have a flight this evening.

03:51.518 --> 03:53.146
Yeah, but I'm sure
it won't be that long.

03:53.148 --> 03:53.981
Okay.

05:12.657 --> 05:13.490
Perfect.

05:36.286 --> 05:39.603
Do you know how much longer it could be?

05:39.605 --> 05:42.450
Well, Mr. Hernandez is out for lunch,

05:42.452 --> 05:45.619
so in a couple of hours he'll be back.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.808
Do you like coffee?

06:09.030 --> 06:11.026
The artwork here is amazing.

06:11.028 --> 06:12.597
You like it?

06:12.599 --> 06:13.820
Yeah.

06:13.822 --> 06:16.155
Can we stop and take a look?

06:37.211 --> 06:38.940
This looks just like in the beginning,

06:38.942 --> 06:39.967
that you see this ones,

06:39.969 --> 06:43.191
and then they started
doing, like, serious art.

06:43.193 --> 06:46.276
It was like like kind of a revolution

06:47.175 --> 06:49.879
because not too long
ago a guy who was doing

06:49.881 --> 06:54.048
his grafittis in, um, I
think it was in the twenties,

06:54.563 --> 06:55.394
,

06:55.396 --> 06:56.790
the one where we saw the big ones?

06:56.792 --> 06:57.623
Yeah.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.759
The policeman killed the guy.

06:59.761 --> 07:00.688
I think he was young.

07:00.690 --> 07:04.857
He was, like, our age and
he said that he killed him

07:04.987 --> 07:07.123
because he was, like, threatening him.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.360
But that's not true.

07:08.362 --> 07:11.948
Then the government started
giving, like, permission

07:11.950 --> 07:15.083
to these people to do their paintings.

07:15.085 --> 07:16.254
Because it's not really like just

07:16.256 --> 07:18.341
scratching your name and that's it.

07:18.343 --> 07:20.289
They started, like, doing paintings

07:20.291 --> 07:22.242
with meanings and everything.

07:22.244 --> 07:25.625
And another thing that
was really upsetting

07:25.627 --> 07:29.218
for a lot of people is
that Justin Bieber came

07:29.220 --> 07:32.970
and he was escort by
police to do a graffiti.

07:34.172 --> 07:36.505
But just because it was him.

07:37.767 --> 07:39.963
Damn Justin Bieber.

07:45.940 --> 07:48.773
So, why didn't your dad come?

07:52.116 --> 07:54.754
He's not really a people person.

07:54.756 --> 07:55.745
Yeah, I've talked to him

07:55.747 --> 07:59.080
a few times on the phone.

07:59.082 --> 07:59.915
Yeah.

08:01.129 --> 08:05.296
He's upset about you guys
switching to organic,

08:05.444 --> 08:06.277
the cost.

08:08.691 --> 08:11.739
It's all, you know, corporate stuff.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.323
What, you don't think I understand?

08:14.325 --> 08:16.307
I'm the eyes and the ears of the company.

08:16.309 --> 08:17.642
I do understand.

08:19.616 --> 08:23.077
You guys know that you're
switching to 75% organic.

08:23.079 --> 08:24.905
Maybe a bit more.

08:24.907 --> 08:27.893
We buy 50% of
everything that you grow.

08:27.895 --> 08:30.260
We don't sell organic.

08:30.262 --> 08:31.845
Well, you should.

08:33.621 --> 08:35.073
I don't think you understand.

08:35.076 --> 08:37.090
Sell organic.

08:37.092 --> 08:39.160
You know, I know people will pay more

08:39.163 --> 08:41.698
because it's a better product.

08:41.701 --> 08:43.118
I agree, but...

08:45.680 --> 08:48.013
You don't understand my dad.

09:24.737 --> 09:26.404
He'll see you now.

09:37.617 --> 09:39.294
Mr. Hernandez.

09:39.296 --> 09:40.796
I'm Daniel Miller.

09:45.081 --> 09:48.729
He wants to know why
your father didn't come.

09:48.731 --> 09:51.862
My father, um, couldn't
make it on such short notice,

09:51.864 --> 09:54.697
so he sent me to send his regards.

10:12.184 --> 10:13.222
What did I do?

10:13.224 --> 10:15.189
He'll see you tomorrow.

10:15.191 --> 10:17.108
No, I can't.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.434
I have a flight in a few hours.

10:23.188 --> 10:24.857
Can I go to his house?

10:24.859 --> 10:27.244
No.

10:27.246 --> 10:28.845
No, I wouldn't go to his house.

10:28.847 --> 10:33.014
He wants me to make an
appointment for tomorrow.

11:16.447 --> 11:17.310
Well, I don't even know

11:17.312 --> 11:19.267
if I'm gonna get to speak to him.

11:19.269 --> 11:21.179
He's gotta see you eventually.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.264
Just hang in there, okay?

11:24.603 --> 11:27.283
Well, what did Dad say?

11:27.285 --> 11:28.618
Um...

11:32.116 --> 11:33.597
Maggie?

11:33.599 --> 11:37.645
I haven't told
him you're down there.

13:06.045 --> 13:06.876
Hey, wait, wait.

13:06.878 --> 13:07.709
Fuck!

13:07.711 --> 13:08.660
Wait, wait!

13:08.662 --> 13:09.493
Fuck me.

13:09.495 --> 13:10.412
Goddamn it.

13:11.266 --> 13:12.099
Fuck!

13:20.750 --> 13:22.583
I need to talk to you.

13:23.836 --> 13:28.003
No, no, no, no.

13:30.085 --> 13:31.498
All my stuff got stolen.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.844
The taxi drove away with
my luggage in the trunk.

13:33.846 --> 13:35.283
Do you know the company of the taxi?

13:35.285 --> 13:36.415
'Cause I can call them.

13:36.417 --> 13:39.770
No, it's just a taxi, I don't know.

13:39.772 --> 13:43.939
Then I don't think
you'll get your stuff back.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.236
Do you have your passport with you?

13:46.238 --> 13:47.069
Yeah.

13:47.071 --> 13:49.351
Is he ready to see me?

13:49.353 --> 13:52.970
Mr. Hernandez had to
go out of town yesterday.

13:52.972 --> 13:55.210
But you have an appointment at three p.m.

13:55.212 --> 13:56.043
Okay.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.045
On Friday.

13:57.999 --> 13:59.187
Friday.

13:59.189 --> 14:00.320
On Friday.

14:00.322 --> 14:01.242
That's four days away.

14:01.244 --> 14:02.970
What am I supposed to do until then?

14:02.972 --> 14:05.716
Hey, Colombia's a pretty
amazing country, so...

14:05.718 --> 14:07.484
This isn't a vacation for me.

14:07.486 --> 14:08.481
This is serious.

14:08.483 --> 14:12.400
Well, is it still gonna
be serious on Friday?

14:14.889 --> 14:17.139
Thanks for all your help.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.371
Do you like Colombia?

14:42.373 --> 14:43.917
No, it fucking sucks here.

14:43.919 --> 14:44.957
Why?

14:44.959 --> 14:46.700
My shit got stolen,

14:46.702 --> 14:49.942
and then Mr. Hernandez left until Friday.

14:49.944 --> 14:52.109
Then you need to wait him out.

14:52.111 --> 14:54.751
Daniel, we need to get this fixed.

14:54.753 --> 14:57.392
All right, well, I
need a hotel and money.

14:57.394 --> 15:00.765
Okay, where are you right now?

15:00.767 --> 15:03.316
I don't know, Bogota.

15:03.318 --> 15:04.591
Just find a place to wait.

15:04.593 --> 15:08.760
I'll get you the money and
I'll get you a hotel, okay?

15:59.725 --> 16:00.556
Hi.

16:00.558 --> 16:02.103
Hi.

16:02.105 --> 16:03.679
How'd you find me here?

16:03.681 --> 16:06.048
I called your sister.

16:06.050 --> 16:07.217
Oh.

16:08.306 --> 16:10.389
Um, do you wanna come in?

16:11.229 --> 16:12.062
Okay.

16:15.804 --> 16:19.971
Are you really going to
stay here for four days?

16:20.532 --> 16:24.337
Well, I'll probably be
down at the pool relaxing.

16:24.339 --> 16:28.469
That's very American.

16:28.471 --> 16:30.721
It's also very practical.

16:32.494 --> 16:33.611
Mm.

16:33.613 --> 16:34.446
What?

16:35.816 --> 16:38.693
Well, I'm off until
Mr. Hernandez comes back,

16:38.695 --> 16:40.778
so I can show you around.

16:41.966 --> 16:43.181
You don't have to.

16:43.183 --> 16:44.234
Yeah, I know I don't have to,

16:44.236 --> 16:46.569
but I can if you want me to.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.356
Eh, sure, why not?

16:51.358 --> 16:52.724
Okay.

16:52.726 --> 16:56.893
We can go to my place because
it's so much better than this.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.927
All right.

16:59.929 --> 17:02.411
Okay, grab your stuff.

17:02.413 --> 17:04.452
I don't have any stuff.

17:04.454 --> 17:07.342
Oh, right.

17:07.344 --> 17:08.175
All right.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.600
Where are we?

17:32.707 --> 17:36.874
You're not going to spend
four days in those clothes.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.510
Welcome to my crib.

17:50.289 --> 17:51.120
Hola.

17:51.122 --> 17:52.698
Hola.

17:56.670 --> 17:57.640
No?

17:57.642 --> 17:58.473
No.

18:14.183 --> 18:17.116
Have you tried?

18:17.118 --> 18:18.111
No.

18:44.495 --> 18:47.804
It's like corn and salt, sugar...

18:50.277 --> 18:52.989
She makes the basic.

18:52.991 --> 18:54.208
Butter.

18:54.210 --> 18:56.210
You'll probably like it.

19:57.343 --> 19:58.973
Daniel?

19:58.975 --> 20:00.558
Breakfast is ready.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.838
What is it?

20:13.930 --> 20:16.348
Do you like the changua?

20:16.350 --> 20:18.287
It's called changua.

20:20.065 --> 20:20.897
What's in it?

20:28.741 --> 20:29.658
So, eggs...

20:30.588 --> 20:31.505
Mm-hm.

20:31.507 --> 20:32.534
- Water.
- Mm-hm.

20:32.536 --> 20:34.109
- Milk.
- Mm-hm.

20:34.111 --> 20:36.293
- And cilantro?
- Mm-hm.

20:36.295 --> 20:37.126
And onion.

20:37.128 --> 20:38.462
And onion.

20:38.464 --> 20:39.297
Yup.

20:50.361 --> 20:51.992
Adios.

20:56.132 --> 20:57.661
Bye.

22:05.717 --> 22:08.082
I want to show you how selling organic

22:08.084 --> 22:11.334
helps the small farms here in Colombia.

22:16.509 --> 22:19.701
So, here they mix everything with poop.

22:19.703 --> 22:22.203
To make the fertilizer.

22:22.205 --> 22:24.289
And they make, like, the...

22:25.520 --> 22:27.663
It's like a lasagna.

22:30.357 --> 22:34.524
So, those are, like, the
hard workers on the farm.

22:38.977 --> 22:41.185
So, they are the ones who,

22:41.187 --> 22:44.770
they eat all the poop
and they transform it

22:47.180 --> 22:48.847
into the fertilizer.

22:49.914 --> 22:52.431
Eight months later, we find this.

22:52.433 --> 22:53.708
So, it doesn't smell.

22:53.710 --> 22:54.541
Like, smell.

22:54.543 --> 22:55.934
It doesn't smell like poop.

23:00.026 --> 23:01.685
No poop.

23:25.455 --> 23:28.205
So, the difference with this farm

23:30.196 --> 23:33.604
is that they work with the coffee,

23:33.606 --> 23:35.773
but it is under the shade.

23:37.681 --> 23:40.924
And it's in different as in, for example,

23:40.926 --> 23:42.513
the ,

23:42.515 --> 23:45.679
that is, like, the main part where

23:45.681 --> 23:47.720
Colombia produces coffee,

23:47.722 --> 23:51.082
and the difference is because they don't,

23:51.084 --> 23:54.940
they have the direct light of the sun,

23:54.942 --> 23:57.109
then the plant needs more,

23:59.099 --> 24:03.016
it needs external help
to keep with the process

24:03.995 --> 24:06.045
and with the sun and everything,

24:06.047 --> 24:07.948
so they put more chemicals and stuff.

24:07.950 --> 24:10.950
But here, this is 100% organic.

25:10.353 --> 25:13.056
But you have a canyon back home, right?

25:13.058 --> 25:14.084
Have a what?

25:14.086 --> 25:15.251
A canyon.

25:15.253 --> 25:18.921
Yes, but it's not
this big, I don't think.

25:18.923 --> 25:20.173
How is yours?

25:21.284 --> 25:23.343
Well, not yours.

25:23.345 --> 25:24.928
It's more orange.

25:36.929 --> 25:37.846
Do you...

25:39.910 --> 25:42.950
Eh.

25:42.952 --> 25:46.337
I was going to say
something about your hair

25:46.339 --> 25:48.131
but then I felt bad.

25:48.133 --> 25:49.018
Why?

25:49.020 --> 25:52.770
Well, it gets really
poofy after it gets wet.

25:53.698 --> 25:56.402
Yeah, but you're, like, bald here.

25:56.404 --> 25:57.723
On the back of my head?

25:57.725 --> 25:59.363
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:59.365 --> 26:01.489
It was a choice.

26:01.491 --> 26:02.908
On the side, too.

26:07.493 --> 26:10.559
I could put it up like this.

26:10.561 --> 26:12.522
Oh, like, you can make a ponytail?

26:12.524 --> 26:13.364
I don't.

26:13.366 --> 26:14.401
But you can.

26:14.403 --> 26:15.655
It's not cool anymore.

26:15.657 --> 26:16.490
Why not?

26:17.811 --> 26:21.978
Because in America
douchebags ruined the man bun.

26:23.468 --> 26:25.468
I mean, here it's not,

26:26.339 --> 26:30.506
now it's, like, more,
liberal the way you dress

26:30.936 --> 26:33.271
and the way you look.

26:33.273 --> 26:35.674
But they judge you a lot here, so, for...

26:35.676 --> 26:37.098
Do you think people judge me?

26:37.100 --> 26:39.121
Not you because you're not from here.

26:39.123 --> 26:41.653
But, for example, here, like, in Bogota

26:41.655 --> 26:44.570
it would be weird if I, I don't know,

26:44.572 --> 26:46.175
if I shaved my head.

26:46.177 --> 26:47.008
You know?

26:47.010 --> 26:48.813
In California

26:48.815 --> 26:50.796
the more different you
look, the more people stare,

26:50.798 --> 26:52.503
which people like.

26:52.505 --> 26:56.672
But do you mean, like, it's
better to look different?

26:57.314 --> 26:58.892
Yeah.

26:58.894 --> 27:02.196
I mean, people like it when
more people look at them.

27:02.198 --> 27:03.698
Yeah, of course.

27:04.569 --> 27:08.264
And if you're confident
about the way you look.

27:08.266 --> 27:12.433
Like, women who shave their
head are usually very confident.

27:14.029 --> 27:17.322
And they have a lot of tattoos.

27:17.324 --> 27:20.578
Sometimes.

27:20.580 --> 27:24.413
I saw that in school
a lot when I was a kid.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.064
Girls in school were really mean.

27:28.066 --> 27:29.322
I don't think they're, like,

27:29.324 --> 27:31.648
they want to be mean to
be mean to other kids,

27:31.650 --> 27:33.458
but it's, like, what they see, so.

27:33.460 --> 27:35.328
I think children are
just horrible people.

27:35.330 --> 27:36.582
Yeah.

27:36.584 --> 27:37.415
Or they're just...

27:37.417 --> 27:38.702
Because, you know why?

27:38.704 --> 27:39.834
Because they're honest.

27:39.836 --> 27:40.875
Exactly.

27:40.877 --> 27:43.500
And they'll make fun of
you in an accurate way.

27:43.502 --> 27:46.572
Like, they'll find something
that you don't like

27:46.574 --> 27:47.410
about yourself.

27:47.412 --> 27:48.450
Yeah, that's true.

27:48.452 --> 27:50.412
And they don't, like, they don't...

27:50.414 --> 27:54.014
Because they don't know
what's wrong or what's right.

27:54.016 --> 27:56.774
Like, what's wrong and what's right.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.283
So they just talk.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.383
Like, they don't need to think.

28:02.677 --> 28:04.099
What do you...

28:04.101 --> 28:06.090
I'm kind of scared.

28:06.092 --> 28:08.842
I know you're joking about dying.

28:09.911 --> 28:10.744
Ah!

28:13.198 --> 28:14.031
Ah.

28:15.095 --> 28:15.928
Ooh!

28:23.629 --> 28:24.556
Industrial.

28:30.029 --> 28:32.612
Why did your dad send you here?

28:34.847 --> 28:35.847
And not him?

28:38.253 --> 28:40.467
He actually didn't send me.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.337
My sister sent me.

28:42.339 --> 28:45.616
My dad doesn't know
that I'm here right now.

28:45.618 --> 28:46.451
Yeah.

28:48.339 --> 28:51.084
And why he didn't come.

28:51.086 --> 28:51.919
Um...

28:52.957 --> 28:54.304
So he doesn't know you're here?

28:54.306 --> 28:55.139
Nope.

28:57.005 --> 29:01.172
So, your dad doesn't know
that you're out of the country?

29:10.749 --> 29:14.495
Me and my dad's
relationship is complicated.

29:14.497 --> 29:16.997
You're not close to him, or?

29:18.462 --> 29:21.212
We used to be, but not anymore.

29:27.013 --> 29:27.930
Mm.

29:49.108 --> 29:50.918
- Hello.
- Hola.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.570
- Dos?
- One.

29:52.572 --> 29:53.744
Uno.

29:53.746 --> 29:55.184
Can I take from yours?

29:55.186 --> 29:56.733
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:56.735 --> 29:58.281
Uno, por favor.

30:19.973 --> 30:21.602
Then, the problem is your head.

30:21.604 --> 30:22.936
You know what else is the problem?

30:22.938 --> 30:24.030
Is my hair adds, like,

30:24.032 --> 30:27.214
- three hat sizes, too.
- Your hair.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.518
Try the other one.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.749
If my hair was really big.

30:29.751 --> 30:32.424
That's for a lady, no?

30:32.426 --> 30:33.597
What's wrong with...

30:33.599 --> 30:34.932
- Try it.
- Okay.

30:36.708 --> 30:39.881
You look like,
uh, like a drunk guy.

30:39.883 --> 30:41.767
I like this one the best.

30:41.769 --> 30:42.769
And it fits.

30:43.743 --> 30:45.177
It looks good on you.

30:45.179 --> 30:46.415
Gracias.

30:48.819 --> 30:51.986
Do a flip!

30:54.852 --> 30:57.098
Next time.

31:00.761 --> 31:01.594
Next time.

31:40.089 --> 31:41.371
What does that mean?

31:42.934 --> 31:44.423
That they have bathroom.

31:44.425 --> 31:45.452
They have bath, oh.

31:45.454 --> 31:47.214
I mean for guests.

31:47.216 --> 31:50.540
Oh my God, we should get this.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.850
Do you wanna try?

31:51.852 --> 31:52.933
What is it, chocolate?

31:52.935 --> 31:53.852
Um, ants.

31:57.779 --> 31:59.148
- Ants?
- You have to try it.

31:59.150 --> 32:00.911
We'll buy the small pack.

32:00.913 --> 32:02.419
Ants?

32:02.421 --> 32:03.701
They're fried ants.

32:03.703 --> 32:05.609
It's like popcorn.

32:05.611 --> 32:07.764
I think,.

32:07.766 --> 32:10.047
Do you wanna try
Colombian popcorn?

32:10.049 --> 32:11.495
Colombian popcorn is ants?

32:11.497 --> 32:13.598
Well, no, but it tastes like popcorn.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.535
Why are they so big?

32:15.537 --> 32:16.737
I don't know.

32:16.739 --> 32:19.261
That's how we call them.

32:19.263 --> 32:20.723
Look at the white spots.

32:20.725 --> 32:22.392
Big ant, no.

32:22.394 --> 32:23.811
The big ass ants.

32:25.191 --> 32:26.444
Does that make sense.

32:26.446 --> 32:28.198
What about the smaller ones?

32:28.200 --> 32:29.653
I have no idea.

32:29.655 --> 32:31.238
But we'll get some.

32:34.966 --> 32:35.799
Ready?

32:39.513 --> 32:40.346
Oh God.

32:41.976 --> 32:42.809
Come on.

32:45.359 --> 32:46.192
Ah!

32:48.714 --> 32:50.732
You don't like their head?

32:50.734 --> 32:52.239
Just eat it.

32:52.241 --> 32:54.223
No, I'm gonna take off the head.

32:54.225 --> 32:57.708
I just did it.

32:57.710 --> 32:58.543
Okay.

33:00.920 --> 33:01.753
Mm.

33:07.030 --> 33:08.730
It's popcorn.

33:10.569 --> 33:12.206
No.

33:12.208 --> 33:14.628
You didn't liked it?

33:14.630 --> 33:15.797
Mm.

33:16.679 --> 33:17.745
No, unh-unh.

33:17.747 --> 33:18.989
Try the butt.

33:20.118 --> 33:20.958
Try the butt.

33:20.960 --> 33:21.791
I did.

33:21.793 --> 33:22.736
Try the butt!

33:22.738 --> 33:24.163
Mm-mm.

33:24.165 --> 33:26.072
Come on!

33:26.074 --> 33:27.060
No.

33:27.062 --> 33:29.361
You're wasting my ants.

33:29.363 --> 33:30.568
Did it fall?

33:30.570 --> 33:31.409
- Yeah.
- Good.

33:31.411 --> 33:32.734
Eat it.

33:34.153 --> 33:35.153
Oh, shut up.

33:42.260 --> 33:43.165
Are you having fun?

33:43.167 --> 33:44.000
Mm-hm.

33:46.270 --> 33:47.561
Are you having fun?

33:47.563 --> 33:48.396
I am.

33:50.219 --> 33:53.636
Do you think that I can call your boss?

33:54.668 --> 33:56.400
I really need to talk to him.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.608
Seriously?

33:57.610 --> 33:59.103
What?

33:59.105 --> 34:00.185
Come on.

34:00.187 --> 34:03.354
We were just talking about having fun.

34:04.864 --> 34:08.281
Why do you think about work all the time?

34:10.141 --> 34:12.380
It's not the only thing, ya know?

34:12.382 --> 34:13.340
All right.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.764
You're right, all right.

34:14.766 --> 34:15.862
No more.

34:15.864 --> 34:17.000
- No more.
- It's gone.

34:17.002 --> 34:18.154
- Out of my head.
- Get it out of your head.

34:18.156 --> 34:19.467
Please, for a second.

34:19.469 --> 34:20.301
Great.

34:22.666 --> 34:23.835
All right, no mas work.

34:25.574 --> 34:26.405
Trajo?

34:26.407 --> 34:27.239
Traa-ho?

34:29.694 --> 34:30.902
We'll work on that.

34:30.905 --> 34:31.735
Okay.

34:32.795 --> 34:35.088
Do you have any special talents.

34:35.090 --> 34:35.922
Yeah!

34:37.603 --> 34:38.437
Ah!

34:40.598 --> 34:42.975
I'm so proud of this.

34:42.976 --> 34:43.810
Nobody.

34:45.626 --> 34:48.126
I can make mine into a bowl.

34:50.134 --> 34:51.498
Okay, you can do the triple thing.

34:51.501 --> 34:53.431
All right, can you, like, wipe your tongue

34:53.434 --> 34:54.851
with your tongue?

34:59.638 --> 35:00.469
No.

35:00.471 --> 35:01.498
That doesn't make sense.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.750
What about your eyebrows?

35:05.719 --> 35:06.550
Do the wave.

35:06.552 --> 35:07.383
Am I doing it?

35:07.385 --> 35:08.216
Nope.

35:08.218 --> 35:09.268
- Am I doing...
- You just look,

35:09.270 --> 35:11.020
like, constipated.

35:12.575 --> 35:14.131
You're like.

35:14.133 --> 35:14.966
Sorry.

35:15.834 --> 35:16.760
I try.

35:16.762 --> 35:18.230
You're having fun, right?

35:18.232 --> 35:19.063
I am.

35:19.065 --> 35:20.148
Okay, good.

35:22.836 --> 35:23.763
Cheers.

35:23.765 --> 35:25.316
Oh, salud.

35:25.318 --> 35:26.494
I have nothing left.

35:26.496 --> 35:27.664
Just a little bit.

35:40.740 --> 35:43.073
So, do you have a boyfriend?

35:46.310 --> 35:49.060
Um.

35:53.588 --> 35:54.421
Do you?

35:55.838 --> 35:58.597
Uh, no, I don't have a boyfriend.

35:58.599 --> 36:00.874
Cool.

36:00.876 --> 36:02.209
What did she do?

36:06.461 --> 36:10.441
Caught her in the
shower with another guy.

36:10.443 --> 36:12.112
That sucks.

36:12.114 --> 36:12.997
Yeah.

36:12.999 --> 36:15.381
What's Spanish for bitch?

36:15.383 --> 36:16.609
Perra.

36:16.611 --> 36:17.689
Perra.

36:17.691 --> 36:18.939
Or puta.

36:18.941 --> 36:19.795
Puta?

36:19.797 --> 36:20.852
Yeah.

36:20.854 --> 36:22.175
It sounds good, right?

36:22.177 --> 36:23.123
Puta!

36:23.125 --> 36:26.174
Yeah, puta.

36:33.583 --> 36:35.250
What else do you do?

36:36.904 --> 36:39.821
Um, I do a lot of stuff.

36:44.773 --> 36:46.072
I really want to.

36:46.074 --> 36:48.028
But I haven't yet.

36:48.030 --> 36:50.558
Where would you wanna go?

36:50.560 --> 36:53.389
Somewhere in Europe, but my first stop,

36:53.391 --> 36:55.761
definitely, would be Paris.

36:55.763 --> 36:56.763
Why Paris?

36:59.901 --> 37:01.361
Dark chocolate.

37:01.363 --> 37:02.858
Do you like dark chocolate?

37:02.860 --> 37:03.901
Dark chocolate?

37:03.903 --> 37:04.734
Yeah.

37:04.736 --> 37:06.736
Let me think.

37:09.922 --> 37:10.891
No.

37:10.893 --> 37:11.862
You don't?

37:11.864 --> 37:14.493
No, I like milk chocolate.

37:16.301 --> 37:18.487
It's 'cause I'm so sweet.

37:21.119 --> 37:23.741
What's your favorite chocolate?

37:23.743 --> 37:26.241
Do you have, like, a specific candy bar.

37:26.243 --> 37:28.409
I love.

37:28.411 --> 37:30.001
Like, Doritos.

37:30.003 --> 37:32.003
Doritos and chocolate?

37:41.016 --> 37:42.872
Thank you for tonight.

37:42.874 --> 37:44.405
Thank you.

37:44.407 --> 37:45.756
I had fun.

37:45.758 --> 37:46.591
Me, too.

37:52.149 --> 37:54.066
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

38:40.881 --> 38:41.714
Come on.

40:02.303 --> 40:05.153
The altitude makes
it a lot harder to breathe.

40:05.155 --> 40:07.087
- Here?
- Mm-hm.

40:07.089 --> 40:10.672
Here is so much
better than Bogota.

40:12.662 --> 40:14.157
Are you feeling bad?

40:14.159 --> 40:15.279
Uh, no.

40:15.281 --> 40:18.536
Just, maybe it's just because
there are so many hills.

40:18.538 --> 40:19.477
So much what?

40:19.479 --> 40:21.135
So many hills.

40:21.137 --> 40:25.304
Oh, then that's because
you need to exercise more.

40:25.874 --> 40:27.279
Do you like bugs?

40:27.281 --> 40:28.493
Bugs?

40:28.495 --> 40:29.451
No.

40:29.453 --> 40:32.536
I only like a bug that I eat.

40:35.680 --> 40:39.847
Cicadas are these bugs
that you'll see on the trees

40:40.790 --> 40:42.220
but when you see them on the trees,

40:42.222 --> 40:43.842
usually they're not actually the bugs,

40:43.844 --> 40:45.779
they're they skin of the bugs.

40:45.781 --> 40:47.589
- What?
- Yeah.

40:47.591 --> 40:49.206
They shed their skin and it looks like

40:49.208 --> 40:51.722
they're still on the tree.

40:51.724 --> 40:52.557
Oh!

40:54.421 --> 40:57.106
Do they turn into something?

40:57.108 --> 40:57.941
Um...

41:00.818 --> 41:02.198
More cicadas.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.122
I don't know.

41:07.821 --> 41:11.738
So, in this town, they
work a lot with stone.

41:14.802 --> 41:18.095
And, for example, here,
what they do with the stone

41:18.097 --> 41:22.206
is that in each grave,
depending on what the person

41:22.208 --> 41:25.958
used to do when he was
alive, then they do...

41:27.342 --> 41:30.235
If the person who died, for example,

41:30.237 --> 41:33.280
played soccer, then they'll put a ball.

41:33.282 --> 41:34.878
That's how you call it?

41:34.880 --> 41:36.198
- A soccer ball?
- Mm-hm.

41:36.200 --> 41:40.055
Or if they liked music then
they'll put an instrument,

41:40.057 --> 41:44.224
or just something that
represents what the person was

41:44.245 --> 41:45.745
when he was alive.

41:48.719 --> 41:51.615
Do you believe in
ghosts and stuff like that?

41:51.617 --> 41:55.784
Ooh,
that's a hard question.

41:56.131 --> 41:58.798
Uh, yeah, like, I believe the...

42:00.273 --> 42:01.633
Yeah.

42:01.635 --> 42:04.278
Like, that they scare people and stuff.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.894
That they stay stuck here.

42:06.896 --> 42:07.935
I've never seen one.

42:07.937 --> 42:09.969
Well, yeah, me neither, but...

42:09.971 --> 42:12.950
When I see
one then I'll believe.

42:12.952 --> 42:17.119
I don't wanna see it
to believe it.

42:39.153 --> 42:41.153
I love places like this.

42:42.767 --> 42:43.598
Rivers?

42:43.600 --> 42:44.840
Mm-hm.

42:44.842 --> 42:46.551
'Cause when I was little I used to

42:46.553 --> 42:50.636
do these trips with my
family to different rivers

42:52.633 --> 42:56.100
and we used to take this giant pot

42:56.102 --> 42:59.647
and my grandmother and my
uncles used to cook in there.

42:59.649 --> 43:02.603
So, it's called?

43:02.605 --> 43:04.355
So, it's like trip...

43:06.654 --> 43:07.571
with a pot.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.513
It's kind of like that, but.

43:12.615 --> 43:14.934
I don't know, here if you told that

43:14.936 --> 43:17.755
to a kid of my generation,

43:17.757 --> 43:20.650
like, to someone of my generation,

43:20.652 --> 43:22.020
they'll say it's not cool,

43:22.022 --> 43:24.911
or that it's trashy to do that.

43:24.913 --> 43:26.369
To travel with the pot?

43:26.371 --> 43:27.426
Yeah, like,

43:27.428 --> 43:30.540
do the.

43:30.542 --> 43:32.341
That's not cool.

43:32.343 --> 43:35.260
It's not cool, but it was so fun.

43:39.932 --> 43:42.413
And you and your family?

43:42.415 --> 43:43.832
Um, and your dad?

43:47.160 --> 43:48.827
What about my dad?

43:50.097 --> 43:50.928
I don't know.

43:50.930 --> 43:53.097
You said you're not close.

44:01.785 --> 44:03.035
I don't know.

44:04.993 --> 44:06.660
But he's your dad.

44:09.627 --> 44:13.794
Well, my mom left when
we were really young,

44:13.926 --> 44:15.343
me and my sister.

44:17.616 --> 44:19.772
And when my dad turned,

44:19.774 --> 44:21.857
when my sister turned 18,

44:25.255 --> 44:28.588
he just sort of stopped being a dad, so.

44:44.085 --> 44:45.602
I think it's getting late.

44:45.604 --> 44:48.021
Do you wanna go to the hotel?

44:49.014 --> 44:50.014
All right.

45:08.105 --> 45:09.272
- Hola.
- Hey!

45:10.231 --> 45:12.063
How's your room?

45:12.065 --> 45:13.065
It's nice.

45:15.136 --> 45:17.028
What are you doing?

45:17.030 --> 45:20.530
Watching the people down at the jacuzzi.

45:21.904 --> 45:23.236
Fun?

45:23.238 --> 45:24.071
Mm-hm.

45:27.371 --> 45:28.539
How's your room?

45:28.541 --> 45:29.372
Hm?

45:29.374 --> 45:30.649
How's your room?

45:30.651 --> 45:32.052
Uh, small.

45:33.889 --> 45:35.389
Smaller than this.

45:42.327 --> 45:44.410
I really like Columbia.

45:45.519 --> 45:47.814
Columbia or Colombia?

45:47.816 --> 45:49.814
Columbia.

45:49.816 --> 45:50.733
Colombia.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.815
Colu, that's what I'm saying.

45:53.817 --> 45:55.385
You're saying it wrong.

45:55.387 --> 45:56.949
Columbia.

45:56.951 --> 45:58.458
Colombia.

45:58.460 --> 45:59.377
Colombia.

46:00.324 --> 46:02.066
With an O.

46:02.068 --> 46:03.421
Cole-ohm-bia.

46:03.423 --> 46:04.786
Colombia.

46:04.788 --> 46:05.736
That's what I'm saying.

46:05.738 --> 46:07.242
Oh my God, you suck at this.

46:07.244 --> 46:09.611
- Colombia.
- Colombia.

46:09.613 --> 46:10.613
Forget it.

46:11.491 --> 46:12.866
Colombia.

46:12.868 --> 46:14.035
Shut up, no.

46:15.707 --> 46:16.707
Say my name.

46:17.620 --> 46:18.931
Colombia.

46:18.933 --> 46:19.850
That's not my name.

46:19.852 --> 46:20.742
Say my name.

46:20.744 --> 46:21.575
Ana.

46:21.577 --> 46:22.581
Ana, yeah.

46:22.583 --> 46:23.902
- Ana.
- Well, that's easy.

46:23.904 --> 46:25.724
Ana from Colombia.

46:25.726 --> 46:29.143
No, just Ana.

46:32.239 --> 46:33.156
Colombia.

46:45.994 --> 46:47.453
- Ready?
- Yeah.

46:47.455 --> 46:48.745
Buenos dias.

46:48.747 --> 46:50.148
- Huh?
- Buenos dias.

46:50.150 --> 46:51.317
Buenos dias.

47:00.710 --> 47:01.553
All right.

47:01.555 --> 47:02.972
Let's go.

47:05.628 --> 47:09.273
Everything here is so
small except for the bugs.

47:09.275 --> 47:11.762
Well, everything there is so big.

47:11.764 --> 47:13.153
In America?

47:13.155 --> 47:14.685
Yeah.

47:14.687 --> 47:17.451
I've heard that if you go to the movies,

47:17.453 --> 47:20.010
for example, and you ask for a small Coke,

47:20.012 --> 47:22.679
they give you a thing like this.

47:23.619 --> 47:25.679
It's more like that.

47:25.681 --> 47:27.548
But it's wide.

47:27.550 --> 47:30.604
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

47:30.606 --> 47:33.335
You don't need that much Coke.

47:33.337 --> 47:34.777
Some people do.

47:34.779 --> 47:36.635
I mean, you're sitting
in a movie for, like,

47:36.637 --> 47:38.777
an hour and a half.

47:38.779 --> 47:40.529
I always get a large.

47:41.498 --> 47:43.979
I never finish it

47:43.981 --> 47:48.009
but I don't wanna get out
of my seat to go refill it.

47:48.011 --> 47:51.913
Okay, do you want plantains, apple,

47:51.915 --> 47:54.165
or cheese with white guava.

47:55.191 --> 47:57.387
Uh, what's a plantain?

47:57.389 --> 47:59.683
This.

47:59.685 --> 48:00.945
It's really good.

48:00.947 --> 48:02.519
What's white java?

48:02.521 --> 48:04.291
- Guava.
- Guava?

48:04.293 --> 48:05.124
Yeah.

48:05.126 --> 48:05.957
What's guava?

48:05.959 --> 48:07.500
- It's a fruit.
- Oh.

48:07.502 --> 48:09.367
- Do you wanna try this?
- I'll have an apple.

48:09.369 --> 48:10.431
- An apple?
- Sure.

48:10.433 --> 48:11.642
Gracias.

48:11.644 --> 48:12.600
- Do you want the apple?
- No.

48:12.602 --> 48:14.151
Or did I take your favorite snack?

48:14.153 --> 48:15.570
I'll have this.

48:17.099 --> 48:18.973
Do you have any nicknames?

48:18.975 --> 48:21.029
- Any what?
- Nicknames.

48:21.031 --> 48:22.198
Like, Anita.

48:23.154 --> 48:24.809
- Anita?
- Anita.

48:24.811 --> 48:25.789
Anita.

48:25.791 --> 48:27.298
Or Ana.

48:27.300 --> 48:28.362
Well, that's my name.

48:28.364 --> 48:29.195
Annie.

48:29.197 --> 48:30.030
Annie.

48:31.222 --> 48:35.389
Um.

48:35.522 --> 48:37.361
I think that's it.

48:37.363 --> 48:38.196
You?

48:39.107 --> 48:39.940
Um...

48:42.380 --> 48:43.213
Danny.

48:47.093 --> 48:47.926
Dan.

48:49.428 --> 48:50.664
Dan.

48:50.666 --> 48:52.034
Big D.

48:52.036 --> 48:53.102
Huh?

48:53.104 --> 48:53.941
Nothing.

48:53.943 --> 48:54.776
Um...

48:55.817 --> 48:56.898
Yeah.

48:56.900 --> 48:59.677
- That's it?
- That's it.

48:59.679 --> 49:02.179
Daniel, it's like, Danielle.

49:04.955 --> 49:05.905
Danielle.

49:05.907 --> 49:07.510
- Danielle.
- Danielle.

49:07.512 --> 49:10.429
And we'll say Danny or Danielito.

49:12.944 --> 49:13.906
Danielito.

49:13.908 --> 49:15.357
That's so much harder than Daniel.

49:15.359 --> 49:18.180
Yeah, but it's like, "Oh, Danielito."

49:18.182 --> 49:19.409
Like, if it's a little kid.

49:19.411 --> 49:20.724
Danielito.

49:20.726 --> 49:22.809
Mm, the cute Danielito.

49:24.119 --> 49:26.286
All right, I'll try one.

49:29.049 --> 49:30.966
Don't smell the food.

49:37.630 --> 49:39.047
It's really good.

49:40.295 --> 49:42.319
It's better than your chips.

49:42.321 --> 49:44.904
It tastes like a fruity chip.

49:46.534 --> 49:49.701
Okay, so this is a game called Tejo.

49:50.617 --> 49:51.585
- Tejo.
- Tejo.

49:51.587 --> 49:52.418
Tejo.

49:52.420 --> 49:53.899
My grandfather was the best.

49:53.901 --> 49:55.283
Well, he is the best.

49:55.285 --> 49:58.236
I haven't done this in a while.

50:04.070 --> 50:05.322
Oh.

50:05.324 --> 50:06.157
Like this.

50:07.686 --> 50:10.396
Be careful with the ceiling.

50:18.884 --> 50:20.159
Ah!

50:20.161 --> 50:20.992
Throw it.

50:31.269 --> 50:32.102
Ah!

50:57.340 --> 50:58.173
Ah!

51:13.091 --> 51:13.924
- Ah!
- Woo!

52:10.213 --> 52:14.380
What are some childhood games
you used to play as a kid?

52:14.425 --> 52:16.013
I used to do a lot of rope.

52:16.015 --> 52:16.967
Jump rope?

52:16.969 --> 52:17.925
Yeah.

52:17.927 --> 52:20.297
Because I am an only child,

52:20.299 --> 52:23.049
so I used to have fun doing that

52:24.627 --> 52:27.710
or I used to paint a lot with my dad.

52:29.553 --> 52:33.386
At the table, like,
before lunch or something.

52:35.428 --> 52:36.751
What did you do?

52:36.753 --> 52:38.285
What did you used to do?

52:38.287 --> 52:41.954
My sister was older,
so there was a lot of

52:43.963 --> 52:47.046
being dressed up and stuff like that.

52:48.517 --> 52:49.483
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:49.485 --> 52:50.566
Like a girl?

52:50.568 --> 52:52.485
No, just in costumes.

52:53.548 --> 52:55.233
You ever seen The Wizard of Oz?

52:55.235 --> 52:56.524
Yeah, of course.

52:56.526 --> 52:58.818
Yeah, I used to dress
up as the Scarecrow

52:58.820 --> 52:59.806
and she would be Dorothy.

52:59.808 --> 53:00.639
I don't know why.

53:03.984 --> 53:05.960
- But...
- And what else?

53:05.962 --> 53:09.022
We used to go to the park a lot.

53:09.024 --> 53:10.944
Not like nowadays that it's like

53:10.946 --> 53:15.113
kids with phones and with
iPhones or.

53:16.672 --> 53:18.268
Nope.

53:18.270 --> 53:20.101
Did you guys ever have,
like, Game Boy or GameCube?

53:20.103 --> 53:21.184
Mm, yeah.

53:21.186 --> 53:24.022
You know Super Mario?

53:24.024 --> 53:25.910
Yeah, we had Mario.

53:25.912 --> 53:27.469
The driving one?

53:27.471 --> 53:31.480
But it was like that you
had to connect it to the TV?

53:31.482 --> 53:32.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:32.627 --> 53:34.675
And like, the one that it's like, um...

53:35.716 --> 53:39.524
That is not the control but it's the rug?

53:39.526 --> 53:42.173
That you had to dance
and the arrows were like.

53:42.175 --> 53:44.538
Yeah, Dance Dance Revolution, yeah.

53:44.540 --> 53:45.790
I loved that.

53:46.698 --> 53:49.584
I forced my dad to play that with me.

53:49.586 --> 53:50.836
It was so cool.

53:56.948 --> 54:00.263
And then we had, um, what was it?

54:00.265 --> 54:04.432
The, uh, Just Dance,
where you had the remote

54:04.833 --> 54:06.933
and you had to match all the dance moves,

54:06.935 --> 54:08.499
not just your feet but
all the dance moves.

54:08.501 --> 54:10.942
There's my boyfriend.

54:10.944 --> 54:11.944
Your what?

54:14.893 --> 54:16.856
I'll be back in a minute.

54:16.858 --> 54:17.691
Huh?

55:49.717 --> 55:50.550
You okay?

55:52.959 --> 55:54.822
Can I ask you a favor?

55:54.824 --> 55:56.023
Yeah.

55:56.025 --> 55:58.942
Can I meet you back in the hotel?

56:00.772 --> 56:03.024
Is everything okay?

58:05.212 --> 58:06.045
Hey.

58:10.621 --> 58:11.454
You okay?

58:12.442 --> 58:13.442
I'm tired.

58:16.273 --> 58:17.486
I'm sorry.

58:17.488 --> 58:20.372
No, it's fine.

58:20.374 --> 58:21.541
What happened?

58:24.403 --> 58:25.236
Oh...

58:28.031 --> 58:29.864
Uh, well, we broke up.

58:33.859 --> 58:37.609
It was, I mean, it was
the right thing to do.

58:38.583 --> 58:42.083
And I couldn't tell him how I was feeling.

58:43.789 --> 58:47.956
I couldn't tell him and I
was hiding things from him

58:48.223 --> 58:50.473
and he didn't trust me, so.

58:54.911 --> 58:56.661
I'm sorry.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.285
Yeah, it's sad, but

59:03.956 --> 59:05.123
it's a relief.

59:09.468 --> 59:11.468
Are you okay?

59:15.863 --> 59:16.863
So what now?

59:20.408 --> 59:23.991
Tomorrow we're going
to have a great day.

59:25.889 --> 59:27.222
Okay.

01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:40.707
So, I think when I
talk to Mr. Hernandez,

01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:43.431
I'm gonna be very
straightforward with him.

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:46.183
Daniel, he's out of the office.

01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:49.897
He's done for today.

01:01:49.899 --> 01:01:51.667
For today?

01:01:51.669 --> 01:01:52.669
I'm sorry.

01:02:03.548 --> 01:02:06.298
Well, what am I supposed to do?

01:02:14.187 --> 01:02:15.178
Hey, come on.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.263
I think I know where we can find him.

01:02:42.468 --> 01:02:44.485
Mr. Hernandez, I am so sorry...

01:02:44.487 --> 01:02:45.794
No business tonight.

01:02:45.796 --> 01:02:46.629
Welcome.

01:02:49.776 --> 01:02:50.609
Woo!

01:06:29.501 --> 01:06:32.834
♪ Happy birthday to you

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:37.849
♪ Happy birthday Anita

01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:43.004
♪ Happy birthday to you

01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:01.041
Mr. Hernandez.

01:08:02.118 --> 01:08:03.785
Uh, come in, please.

01:08:13.276 --> 01:08:15.859
Did you enjoy your time here?

01:08:19.336 --> 01:08:21.002
It was incredible.

01:08:22.853 --> 01:08:26.379
I'm really sorry that we
didn't get the chance to talk.

01:08:26.381 --> 01:08:29.729
Ana told me everything I needed to know.

01:08:29.732 --> 01:08:33.899
You and Ana and your sister are
the future of the companies.

01:08:37.443 --> 01:08:40.081
The problems went to the past.

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.082
Thank you.

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:49.988
You will tell Ana good morning for me?

01:09:42.746 --> 01:09:47.746
