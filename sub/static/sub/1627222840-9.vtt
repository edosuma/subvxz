00:24.416 --> 00:27.125
The good thing
about really fucked-up situations

00:27.625 --> 00:29.708
is that they can only happen once.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.000
You can only get killed once.

00:32.625 --> 00:35.041
You only lose the love of your life once.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.041
You're only robbed of the greatest
treasure anyone has ever stolen once.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.958
But the fact
that all these things only happen once

00:45.000 --> 00:46.666
doesn't make them less painful.

01:31.416 --> 01:32.916
You feel devastated.

01:33.416 --> 01:35.833
You see the faces
of the people you've disappointed.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.666
It's like a cannonball
hurling through your chest.

01:40.708 --> 01:43.916
At that point,
when the anxiety won't let you breathe,

01:44.500 --> 01:46.125
you have two options.

01:46.208 --> 01:47.375
Accept your defeat

01:48.041 --> 01:49.208
or fight.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.708
And the Professor chose to fight.

01:58.791 --> 02:01.000
Although he knew that all was lost,

02:01.083 --> 02:02.666
that he was, most likely,

02:02.750 --> 02:04.916
only prolonging his suffering,

02:05.416 --> 02:06.541
he chose to fight.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.333
Turn on the GPS.
Find the signal for the trucks.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.791
They don't know they're being tracked.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.833
Palermo, Lisbon, private line.

02:15.916 --> 02:18.250
They're 2.5 miles away.
They aren't moving.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.958
At the next crossroads, everyone go west.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.375
Roger that.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.500
Weapons ready, they're 2.5 miles away.

02:33.458 --> 02:34.833
Lisbon, do you copy?

02:37.041 --> 02:38.666
Come on, Lisbon, respond.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.333
This is Lisbon.
I'm with Palermo. What is it?

02:42.000 --> 02:42.916
The gold is gone.

02:44.833 --> 02:45.666
What did you say?

02:45.750 --> 02:49.333
They came in pretending to be police
when we had the gold loaded up.

02:49.875 --> 02:51.791
They tied us up and took everything.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.541
-How many were there?
-Ten.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.166
Wait a minute, Sergio.

02:55.666 --> 02:59.125
Did they arrive
right when the ingots were in the trucks?

02:59.208 --> 03:01.125
-That's when they went in?
-Yes.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.833
You know what that means, right?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.416
We have a mole.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.000
It's an abandoned quarry.
They're not moving.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.583
They're unloading the gold.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.875
They're in the old Santa Bárbara quarry.

03:16.875 --> 03:19.833
For fuck's sake! No!

03:19.916 --> 03:21.458
-God!
-Palermo.

03:21.541 --> 03:25.708
You know this bank better than anyone.
Tell me there's another way out.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.750
Without the gold, we're done for.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.166
Then we're done for.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.041
There they are.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.958
Go easy.

04:36.958 --> 04:38.458
Darko, we're getting out.

04:39.625 --> 04:40.833
Cover the flanks.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.083
We'll check the trucks.

04:45.625 --> 04:48.125
The rest of you, cover us.
They could be anywhere.

04:51.916 --> 04:52.750
Now.

05:11.375 --> 05:12.416
Cover them.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.666
Guy with the beard, here.
Watch the baby.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.708
Fuck!

06:02.291 --> 06:03.125
No!

06:12.958 --> 06:14.291
The trucks are empty.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.083
They unloaded 90 tons of gold
in half an hour. This…

06:18.166 --> 06:20.500
This wasn't improvised.
They knew the plan.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.791
It could only have been one person.

06:27.083 --> 06:29.083
You know exactly who it was.

06:29.166 --> 06:31.250
No. She knew about the target.

06:31.333 --> 06:35.416
She didn't know how we'd get the gold out
or any details of the plan.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.416
You put everything in the safe each night.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.875
Your brother was in love.

06:38.958 --> 06:43.416
Do you really think strategy
was more important to him than love?

06:43.500 --> 06:44.833
-Seriously?
-Yes.

06:44.916 --> 06:47.041
Considering our lives depend on it, yes!

06:47.125 --> 06:49.041
People talk in bed, Sergio.

06:49.125 --> 06:50.541
And you're no exception.

06:51.750 --> 06:56.375
You told me about the Paris Plan in bed,
because you knew no one could hear it.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.875
You knew you were putting a noose
around your associates' necks

06:59.958 --> 07:01.083
to save me.

07:02.916 --> 07:05.458
We both knew
they would come in after that.

07:06.458 --> 07:07.875
And now Tokyo is dead.

07:09.791 --> 07:12.083
That's what people talk about in bed.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.000
About secrets that endanger
other people's lives.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.250
Your brother did it,

07:17.541 --> 07:18.625
you did it,

07:20.416 --> 07:21.333
and I did it.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.583
Sergio.

07:35.416 --> 07:38.458
Let's lighten the mood.
Who were you talking about?

07:41.250 --> 07:43.041
About my brother's ex-wife.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.500
Great, and what does she do?

07:46.916 --> 07:47.916
She's a pianist.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.000
And a thief!

07:59.166 --> 08:03.375
She knew everything!

08:29.583 --> 08:32.875
All this time,
they've been staying here, watching us.

08:33.375 --> 08:34.583
They saw everything.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.416
All they had to do was time us.

08:38.791 --> 08:41.250
They knew that, once the trucks went in,

08:41.333 --> 08:45.666
it would be eight to ten hours
until they left, that's why…

08:47.000 --> 08:49.083
That's why they got there just in time.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.333
We don't have all day, guys!

09:03.416 --> 09:04.375
Let's go, guys!

09:04.458 --> 09:06.666
Come on! Hurry up!

09:06.750 --> 09:07.750
Let's go!

09:11.333 --> 09:12.500
Move!

09:12.583 --> 09:14.875
Let's go! Come on, that's good.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.041
All right, that's good.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.125
-Eight minutes and we're done.
-Let's go!

09:21.208 --> 09:22.333
Come on!

09:22.875 --> 09:23.958
Let's go!

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
This message is for the whole gang.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.958
Someone stole our gold.

10:22.250 --> 10:25.625
They came into the stormwater tank
pretending to be police.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.000
We're going after them.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.375
We're looking for several dump trucks.

10:31.458 --> 10:34.708
They loaded them with the ingots
and covered them in dirt.

10:35.458 --> 10:38.125
The cargo is uncovered
to avoid arousing suspicion.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.916
It's crucial that no one knows
the gold's been stolen.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.291
Not the hostages, not the police, no one.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.666
Because any setback
would finish us off, got that?

10:46.750 --> 10:47.625
Got it.

10:47.708 --> 10:48.708
Copy.

10:48.791 --> 10:50.291
-Helsinki?
-Got it.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.000
-Manila?
-Copy.

10:52.083 --> 10:53.333
Denver? Stockholm?

10:54.416 --> 10:56.250
Denver, Stockholm, do you copy?

10:59.333 --> 11:00.500
Rio, listen to me.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.958
I need you to hack all the traffic cameras

11:04.041 --> 11:06.666
near the Santa Bárbara quarry, okay?

11:07.250 --> 11:11.333
Go to the stormwater tank.
Take miners, the Captain and those trucks.

11:11.416 --> 11:14.791
Get rid of the police vans
and start the Tom Thumb Plan.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.458
Got it. Captain, the Polish guy and you,
get in the trucks.

11:20.208 --> 11:23.458
And everyone else,
before a crisis unfolds,

11:23.541 --> 11:26.916
think about what you want to study
in a maximum-security prison.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.166
I give you my word…

11:30.208 --> 11:31.583
…we'll get the gold back

11:32.791 --> 11:34.166
and get you out.

11:34.250 --> 11:38.250
That was the first time the Professor
said something nobody believed.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.083
-You can't just remove it.
-Yes, you can.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.541
You'll see.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.000
Who did it?

12:58.750 --> 13:02.916
Who is the funny guy,
or girl, who put this hake in my bed?

13:10.208 --> 13:13.250
Fine.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.125
You know what?

13:17.750 --> 13:19.708
I resign as the brains of the gang.

13:19.791 --> 13:21.791
I'd rather party. Pass the patxarán.

13:22.375 --> 13:24.416
It's more of an amaretto than patxarán--

13:24.500 --> 13:26.583
I don't give a shit what it is.

13:32.666 --> 13:34.166
Drink up. Drink.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.791
-I'll have a smoke too.
-Good for you.

13:39.916 --> 13:44.125
Do you know why you're here?
You're here to let off steam.

13:44.208 --> 13:47.250
Because concentrating all day
is difficult, isn't it?

13:48.208 --> 13:49.708
It's exhausting, isn't it?

13:49.791 --> 13:52.208
This party you've organized is a sign.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.583
A sign of weakness.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.541
It shows you don't have what it takes
to be stressed all day.

13:57.333 --> 14:01.708
Nairobi's the only responsible one.
You have to be on guard all day.

14:01.791 --> 14:05.250
You have to be on guard all day,
clenching your fists, Bogotá.

14:05.958 --> 14:10.208
Tokyo. Helsinki.
Your ass has to be as tight as a drum.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.708
That's the way to be.
On the lookout, like an owl.

14:12.791 --> 14:14.208
Stiff, vigilant.

14:14.291 --> 14:17.666
Because as soon as you lower your guard,
they'll get you.

14:17.750 --> 14:21.708
Some son of a bitch, some bastard,
will be on guard all day long,

14:21.791 --> 14:22.833
and he'll get you.

14:22.916 --> 14:24.416
-We'll clean up.
-No!

14:28.250 --> 14:32.458
You need to let off steam?
Hey, then let's let off steam.

14:32.541 --> 14:33.750
Let's relax then.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.791
Everybody relax. Let's see.

14:58.416 --> 14:59.833
No class tomorrow.

15:08.916 --> 15:10.125
You can share notes.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.541
Come on, let's all dance!

15:25.625 --> 15:27.291
-Come on.
-Let's do it.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.500
The day the gang fell,

15:35.458 --> 15:38.166
we all thought about
that night with the hake.

15:39.333 --> 15:43.000
But we didn't lower our guard
because we needed to let off steam.

15:43.833 --> 15:46.208
We did it out of despair
from having lost the gold,

15:46.291 --> 15:50.166
and with it, something even worse,
the trust we had in our leader.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.166
So it was hard to stay on guard
and realize that the real danger…

15:57.166 --> 15:58.250
had lurked around us

15:59.416 --> 16:03.541
from the exact moment
we thought we had broken Sagasta.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.333
We came in here with the mission

16:07.416 --> 16:10.041
to end this heist,
and that's what we're going to do.

16:10.125 --> 16:11.875
There's two of you and one psycho.

16:11.958 --> 16:14.041
Right now, you don't stand a chance.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.208
More than ever,

16:16.041 --> 16:18.333
because this time
they really won't see it coming.

16:19.458 --> 16:22.583
We need someone to put an end to all this.

16:23.458 --> 16:24.375
Pay attention.

16:24.458 --> 16:27.583
You're going to go inside
the ventilation ducts,

16:27.666 --> 16:28.750
but don't do anything.

16:28.833 --> 16:33.458
Even if you find three of them sleeping
in front of you and you could kill them,

16:33.541 --> 16:35.000
restrain yourself.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.041
I'm at the main entrance.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.375
-Status?
-There are four charges.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.333
You have to move like a ghost.

16:42.416 --> 16:44.041
We'll buy you time.

16:44.125 --> 16:47.291
I'll negotiate for surgeons
to be allowed in to operate on Ramiro.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.000
You'll radio the command post.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.833
The doctors they send in
should be soldiers.

16:52.916 --> 16:55.458
They're going to take part
in a covert operation.

16:55.541 --> 16:57.000
What is the mission?

16:57.083 --> 16:59.458
To open this fucking building.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.125
They feel strong locked up in here.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.791
But there's less than 10 of them
and the army's outside.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.791
You're going to open up three gaps.

17:07.416 --> 17:08.583
The loading docks,

17:09.458 --> 17:11.833
large windows on the first floor,

17:13.125 --> 17:15.416
and, most importantly, the main entrance.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.958
Once you've done that,
we will have won this war.

17:19.625 --> 17:22.250
They'll take the bank
in under ten minutes.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.166
And you?

17:23.250 --> 17:26.791
Together with you, and the surgeons,

17:27.500 --> 17:29.208
we're the Trojan horse.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.416
Main access cleared.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.583
Good job. We'll wait for your signal.

17:42.291 --> 17:43.208
Hey, so…

17:44.916 --> 17:47.500
Considering how confused you were about…

17:49.208 --> 17:51.416
your past, you, Manila, I don't know,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.541
you seemed really into it.

17:54.708 --> 17:55.916
How was I "into it"?

17:57.083 --> 17:58.875
Your eagerness, your thrust…

18:00.041 --> 18:01.250
I overdid it, right?

18:01.833 --> 18:06.583
I overdid it. I should've been gentler,
but with the striptease you did for me,

18:06.666 --> 18:08.500
you didn't make it easy for me.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.833
Did you like it? Was it okay?

18:18.375 --> 18:19.291
But seriously,

18:19.875 --> 18:21.291
how do you feel now?

18:23.625 --> 18:24.958
Everything is clearer now.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.708
-Really?
-Yes.

18:26.791 --> 18:27.625
Yes,

18:28.708 --> 18:33.041
because before you have an orgasm,
your head is full of noise.

18:33.125 --> 18:34.166
When you ejaculate,

18:34.250 --> 18:37.500
only one of two things can happen,
you want to get the hell out

18:38.791 --> 18:40.833
or stay with that person forever.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.291
And what do you want to do?

18:45.416 --> 18:46.791
I want to stay here,

18:47.791 --> 18:48.625
with you,

18:49.916 --> 18:51.458
holding you, forever.

18:51.541 --> 18:53.041
If you want to, of course.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.375
But with one condition.

19:01.000 --> 19:01.833
What?

19:02.875 --> 19:05.166
That the next time you want to go out,

19:05.666 --> 19:06.625
don't lie to me.

19:07.833 --> 19:10.583
Take me with you.
Party with me until the sun rises.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.125
-Or until it sets again.
-Exactly.

19:25.416 --> 19:28.125
Fuck, can't you knock?
What's wrong with you?

19:28.208 --> 19:29.750
Someone stole the gold.

19:31.708 --> 19:32.708
What?

19:32.791 --> 19:34.583
Not a word about this.

19:35.291 --> 19:38.125
If anyone finds out,
it's over, we're dead.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.625
Fucking hell.

19:46.583 --> 19:47.666
Come on, hurry up!

20:50.583 --> 20:51.458
Let's go.

21:01.416 --> 21:02.958
I have access to the server.

21:03.041 --> 21:05.166
I'm in. We have the traffic cameras.

21:08.041 --> 21:09.750
Check the ones on the M60.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.458
They must have exited at kilometer 26.

21:12.541 --> 21:14.541
Got it. Exit 26, Madrid-Barcelona.

21:14.625 --> 21:18.875
We're looking for three dump trucks,
maybe four, between 10:55 and 11:10.

21:19.625 --> 21:21.250
I don't see any trucks there.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.250
Look for heavy goods vehicles.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.000
Nothing.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.708
Nothing in those 15
or the next 15 minutes.

21:27.791 --> 21:30.208
They took a country road with no cameras.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.750
Any idiot knows that.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.375
-No one will be able to find them.
-We still have time.

21:34.458 --> 21:37.166
We still have time
to protect our people outside.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.083
Cincinnati, my daughter and my mom.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.083
I'm not going to give up now.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.625
You already did.
When you put your hands up.

21:43.708 --> 21:47.000
You had weapons, men,
a secure position, and you surrendered.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.125
It was a lost war.

21:49.208 --> 21:52.750
They came in with patrol cars,
special operations vans.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.750
It looked serious. Killing 20 policemen
wouldn't have saved us.

21:55.833 --> 21:58.916
They weren't police!
It was a fucking magic trick!

21:59.000 --> 22:02.250
You fell for your own tricks,
your own disguises.

22:02.333 --> 22:04.083
-You fell for it!
-Shut up!

22:22.083 --> 22:23.083
Wait a second.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.958
Palermo already said it.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.000
It's Berlin's son.

22:28.750 --> 22:32.625
They're playing the same cards as us.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.041
Lisbon was right.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.625
Of course it's a magic trick.

22:37.708 --> 22:40.708
It was a trick when they stole our gold.
It's still a trick now.

22:40.791 --> 22:44.250
They knew we would check
the security cameras.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.833
That's all we could do.

22:45.916 --> 22:48.375
And that we would believe what we saw.

22:48.958 --> 22:53.458
But maybe what we're seeing isn't real.

22:53.541 --> 22:55.041
Rio, check the images again.

22:55.125 --> 23:00.083
Look for something, a loop,
anything, a sign that the images are fake.

23:01.250 --> 23:04.625
The asphalt. It's wet.
It rained yesterday, not today.

23:06.500 --> 23:10.958
They altered the images instead
of taking a side road with no cameras.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.958
-Why go to all that trouble?
-Because they need to.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.208
Exactly.

23:15.791 --> 23:18.625
They're going somewhere
they can only get to on this road.

23:18.708 --> 23:21.916
The M60 is a beltway.
They'd never use it to flee Madrid.

23:23.791 --> 23:26.208
Because they're not fleeing.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.833
They're hiding.

23:27.916 --> 23:30.541
No one flees
with 90 tons of a country's gold.

23:30.625 --> 23:33.416
What do you do
when you have so much money and gold

23:34.500 --> 23:35.750
you can't take it with you?

23:35.833 --> 23:37.375
What did Pablo Escobar do?

23:37.458 --> 23:39.166
-What do pirates do?
-Bury the loot!

23:39.250 --> 23:41.000
That's why they're using dump trucks.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.916
-That's right.
-The gold is underground.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.916
-Correct!
-Where do you bury that kind of loot?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.625
Wherever it is,

23:48.125 --> 23:50.916
the hole you need to dig
to bury 90 tons of gold

23:51.000 --> 23:53.500
requires moving so much dirt
and machinery…

23:55.833 --> 23:58.541
that we still have a chance to find it.

23:59.541 --> 24:00.375
Higher.

24:01.625 --> 24:02.750
Higher.

25:23.541 --> 25:24.666
Attention!

25:25.625 --> 25:28.791
I want everyone dressed
as anything other than a soldier.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.541
Doctor, civil protection,
ambulance driver…

25:31.625 --> 25:33.666
We'll intervene when they least expect it.

25:33.750 --> 25:36.333
We'll approach the bank in camouflage,

25:36.416 --> 25:38.583
gather troops in blind spots

25:38.666 --> 25:41.583
and wait for Sergeant Arteche's signal.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.416
-Got that?
-Yes, sir!

25:43.500 --> 25:45.125
Go get them!

25:46.750 --> 25:48.125
Let's go!

25:53.791 --> 25:55.250
I'm entering the library.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.458
I'm about to make contact
with Major Sagasta.

25:58.541 --> 25:59.500
Copy, Sergeant.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.208
All units in position.

26:17.166 --> 26:19.500
Suárez, keep your men in a blind spot.

26:19.583 --> 26:20.625
Copy, Colonel.

26:25.041 --> 26:26.250
Wait for my command.

26:45.541 --> 26:47.625
Established visual contact with the major.

26:47.708 --> 26:48.833
Mendizábal, status?

26:48.916 --> 26:50.958
-We're in position, Colonel.
-Copy.

26:53.250 --> 26:54.708
Let's go!

26:54.791 --> 26:55.750
Get ready!

26:55.833 --> 26:57.500
We're still in a blind spot.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.916
-Cañizo?
-Colonel, the charge is ready.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.625
Sargent, all units are ready
and awaiting your signal.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.375
Keep your head down.

27:18.166 --> 27:19.833
There's nothing to see here.

27:22.583 --> 27:23.541
Arteche.

27:26.208 --> 27:27.500
Arteche, what's going on?

27:27.583 --> 27:30.375
-Another heist man has come back in.
-Head down.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.541
I'm going to wait.

27:33.083 --> 27:34.750
How's that leg doing, Fatty?

27:36.083 --> 27:39.000
Good. I can't feel anything yet.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.500
-Are the hostages giving you trouble?
-No.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.500
They're quiet.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.791
I have to tell you something.

27:49.916 --> 27:51.791
This sounds like a goodbye.

27:52.916 --> 27:56.625
The Professor lost the gold.
I doubt we'll get out of here.

27:56.708 --> 27:59.416
Palermo, you'll get me out of here.

28:00.916 --> 28:02.083
You promised,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.125
and you'll do it.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.958
You may have your doubts,

28:07.708 --> 28:08.583
but I don't.

28:33.291 --> 28:35.875
-Someone do something.
-What's going on?

28:39.458 --> 28:40.791
Initiating phase two.

28:40.875 --> 28:44.208
Let us go. He needs
immediate medical attention, please.

28:44.291 --> 28:45.458
Okay, don't move.

28:45.541 --> 28:48.083
Hostages, get down!

28:48.166 --> 28:49.708
Get down or I'll kill you!

28:50.791 --> 28:51.916
Open your mouth.

28:54.583 --> 28:55.916
Stick your tongue out!

28:56.416 --> 28:57.416
I'm inside.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.958
Units on alert, Arteche is going in.

29:01.083 --> 29:03.875
It's not epilepsy.
He probably has brain damage.

29:04.625 --> 29:07.250
-Subdural hematoma.
-We need to trepan it now.

29:07.333 --> 29:08.625
Release us, please.

29:08.708 --> 29:11.583
-Release the doctors, fuck!
-Major, shut up!

29:13.375 --> 29:14.875
Come here. Slowly.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.291
You too.

29:21.458 --> 29:24.375
Move and I'll blow your head off, bastard!

29:28.166 --> 29:29.250
Shoot, Fatty!

29:29.333 --> 29:31.375
Shoot and I'll blow his head off.

29:31.458 --> 29:33.125
You have a machine gun, kill them!

29:33.208 --> 29:35.500
-Drop the weapon.
-I'm dying to kill him.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.208
Give me an excuse.

29:37.291 --> 29:38.375
Five.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.041
Four.

29:40.125 --> 29:42.583
-Three. Two.
-Fucking do it!

29:43.333 --> 29:44.750
-Don't do it.
-One.

29:48.916 --> 29:49.875
Drop it, damn.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.958
Major, do you copy?

29:55.041 --> 29:56.125
Library cleared.

29:56.916 --> 30:00.666
Major Sagasta is operational
and in charge of the Trojan horse.

30:05.291 --> 30:06.125
Colonel.

30:07.750 --> 30:09.583
You have the green light to proceed.

30:09.666 --> 30:12.083
Calling all units. We're going in now!

30:32.625 --> 30:34.666
Come on! Get down!

30:49.083 --> 30:50.041
Charge!

31:05.458 --> 31:06.375
Don't move!

31:12.333 --> 31:13.958
Get down on the ground!

31:14.041 --> 31:15.416
-Get down!
-Stop!

31:19.041 --> 31:19.916
Don't move!

31:22.791 --> 31:23.833
Don't move!

31:31.916 --> 31:33.083
Charge!

31:49.708 --> 31:50.541
Let's go!

31:55.958 --> 31:57.458
Hands on your head!

31:59.125 --> 32:00.166
Get down!

32:02.500 --> 32:04.458
Get down!

32:30.500 --> 32:31.916
Hands on your head!

32:45.458 --> 32:46.833
Hands on your head!

32:58.208 --> 32:59.583
Major Sagasta here,

33:00.791 --> 33:02.708
informing you that the gang has fallen.

33:02.791 --> 33:05.000
There are no casualties
on our side or theirs.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.666
The hostages are safe.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.125
Over and out.

34:55.375 --> 34:57.625
Professor, this is Tamayo.

34:57.708 --> 35:00.291
You'll be surprised to hear me
on your gang's radio.

35:00.375 --> 35:03.958
I regret to inform you that
this is not a trick like one of yours.

35:04.458 --> 35:06.333
If you want proof, hold on.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.333
Don't worry.
We're all alive, but on our knees.

35:15.375 --> 35:18.333
They deactivated the charges
and entered in a coordinated manner.

35:20.125 --> 35:23.666
And if you need visual confirmation,
just turn on the TV,

35:23.750 --> 35:26.750
because they're going
to appear live before a judge,

35:26.833 --> 35:28.666
one at a time, the whole band.

35:28.750 --> 35:30.250
Like the Rolling Stones.

35:31.416 --> 35:35.958
So I recommend you find
the deepest, darkest hole you can.

35:36.041 --> 35:37.416
We're coming for you.

35:38.041 --> 35:39.458
That won't be necessary.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.291
I'm turning myself in.

35:46.125 --> 35:50.958
Even my own gang never fully understood
why I stayed outside the bank.

35:51.458 --> 35:53.750
Some thought I did it out of cowardice.

35:54.250 --> 35:58.125
If something went wrong…
I'd be outside and they wouldn't.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.583
I promised myself
that if the gang went down,

36:03.708 --> 36:04.708
I'd go down with them.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.708
You've already won, Tamayo.

36:09.791 --> 36:13.458
So it makes no sense for us
to keep dragging this out with a chase

36:13.541 --> 36:15.250
while we endanger more lives.

36:15.833 --> 36:16.791
I'm asking…

36:19.291 --> 36:22.500
man to man,
that you accept my surrender and…

36:23.875 --> 36:25.666
And allow me to go into the bank

36:26.583 --> 36:28.958
and come out in handcuffs
with my associates.

36:29.958 --> 36:32.833
I'll be there in 20 minutes,
just in time for the photo op.

36:32.916 --> 36:35.500
Try to make that 15 minutes instead of 20.

36:38.791 --> 36:40.041
You're surrendering?

36:42.208 --> 36:43.791
This is Colonel Tamayo.

36:43.875 --> 36:45.916
Keep the hostages in the library.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.125
Don't let anyone out of there.
Nobody gets to leave! Understood?

36:51.125 --> 36:54.333
What are you trying to do?
Be a hero? Or a martyr?

36:54.416 --> 36:57.583
Listen to me.
If the gang leaves the bank, it's over.

36:58.875 --> 37:02.250
All will be lost.
There will be no turning back, but now…

37:03.791 --> 37:07.291
We still have a chance.
It's one in a million, but it's there.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.583
A chance to do what?

37:09.666 --> 37:11.125
I need you to find the gold.

37:11.625 --> 37:12.958
-What?
-With Benjamín.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.750
-What?
-I need you to find the gold.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.416
Now. Right now.

37:19.708 --> 37:21.208
I need you to find the gold.

37:24.416 --> 37:25.458
My God.

37:26.458 --> 37:27.291
My God.

37:28.125 --> 37:29.958
-Listen.
-Did you hear that, Logroño?

37:30.041 --> 37:33.416
It turns out that we,
the new mom and the ex-convict,

37:33.500 --> 37:36.916
are in charge of delivering
the final blow, the checkmate,

37:37.000 --> 37:38.041
the masterstroke.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.083
Don't fuck with me.

37:39.166 --> 37:41.041
If anyone can do it, it's you.

37:41.125 --> 37:45.791
I am a woman who just had a baby
and I'm breastfeeding.

37:45.875 --> 37:49.291
I can't think straight
and I'm tired, very tired.

37:49.375 --> 37:53.500
I don't know if I can deal with a war
between organized crime families.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.125
-I don't know.
-All you have to do is find some robbers.

37:56.208 --> 37:58.833
You've been doing it your whole life.
You're the best.

37:58.916 --> 38:01.708
-Don't suck up to me, Sergio.
-You found me.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.541
I'm the most wanted man in all of Spain.

38:05.875 --> 38:10.708
Alicia, Interpol spent month after month
looking for me all over the planet.

38:11.791 --> 38:13.208
They never found me. You did.

38:14.416 --> 38:15.583
In a few hours.

38:15.666 --> 38:18.416
You snuck out of a press conference
full of journalists.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.083
You ran away from Tamayo,
from the entire police force,

38:21.166 --> 38:23.625
while you were 9 months pregnant
and you found me!

38:24.833 --> 38:26.666
You're going to find that gold!

38:27.875 --> 38:29.833
So take those cars and this gang…

38:32.000 --> 38:35.541
and go find the biggest loot in history.

38:42.166 --> 38:43.583
Alicia. Yes.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.666
Consider yourself lucky.

39:13.750 --> 39:16.291
This is the first time
I've given a real hug

39:16.375 --> 39:17.875
since Germán died.

39:18.583 --> 39:19.916
And most importantly,

39:21.500 --> 39:24.333
it's the first time I've smiled for real.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.625
What made you smile?

39:26.708 --> 39:29.000
Well, you're leaving me with Columbo…

39:31.291 --> 39:33.291
and Starsky and Hutch and friends.

39:33.375 --> 39:34.500
They're the best.

39:36.041 --> 39:36.916
Sure.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.125
I need you to do me one last favor.

40:00.875 --> 40:04.291
I can't go in our cars,
they can be traced, but that one…

40:06.625 --> 40:07.500
Go now.

40:11.458 --> 40:13.708
Gentlemen, let's go!

40:13.791 --> 40:16.125
When you see my daughter, tell her…

40:17.458 --> 40:18.958
Tell her that I love her lots.

40:38.375 --> 40:40.666
-Good afternoon.
-Are you the Professor?

40:41.750 --> 40:42.583
That's right.

40:45.083 --> 40:46.541
You have a lovely car.

41:41.125 --> 41:42.375
Come on, push.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.666
Come on, push.

42:02.541 --> 42:03.625
Jesus Christ.

42:08.666 --> 42:10.583
They've cleaned us out, Colonel.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.250
They took the entire national reserve.

42:15.916 --> 42:17.625
Do you know what that means?

42:19.208 --> 42:21.333
It's a country's credit guarantee.

42:21.958 --> 42:24.125
Its solvency! Its collateral!

42:25.458 --> 42:28.083
-Do you understand?
-I understand, Mr. Mario.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.208
-Cañizo.
-Colonel.

42:32.291 --> 42:35.875
I want your men to fire
intermittent bursts every other minute,

42:35.958 --> 42:38.333
as if they're holding the fort down here.

42:38.416 --> 42:39.625
At your command.

42:39.708 --> 42:42.833
Until we know what the fuck to say,
the operation continues.

43:09.500 --> 43:10.333
Cincinnati.

43:11.500 --> 43:14.083
Fuck, Cincinnati. I have to go, Professor.

43:14.166 --> 43:16.333
-I have to go.
-Okay.

43:16.416 --> 43:17.916
-It's my turn.
-Okay.

43:36.125 --> 43:40.500
Look at that. Only the party professionals
are left standing.

43:40.583 --> 43:41.666
That's you and me.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.500
Now this is the resistance.

43:50.375 --> 43:52.333
-Exactly.
-No.

43:52.416 --> 43:53.666
-That?
-That?

43:53.750 --> 43:55.375
No, this is.

43:59.500 --> 44:00.958
I love you a lot, Tokyo.

44:06.625 --> 44:07.708
A lot.

44:09.750 --> 44:10.625
Me too.

44:14.708 --> 44:15.541
A lot.

44:18.250 --> 44:19.541
You know why?

44:20.416 --> 44:21.958
Because of my dance moves?

44:22.625 --> 44:23.458
What?

44:27.583 --> 44:29.541
Because you always make it to the end.

44:31.625 --> 44:34.666
That's why you're still here
with me at 8:00 a.m.

44:36.625 --> 44:38.375
Am I wrong? Am I?

44:38.458 --> 44:40.041
No, it's true.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.541
I realized that you're a hero.

44:49.458 --> 44:51.875
The rest of us can drink and horse around

44:53.958 --> 44:56.583
because you're on the other side,
holding the fort down.

44:59.833 --> 45:00.666
Yes.

45:13.166 --> 45:15.500
With you, we know nothing can go wrong.

45:23.083 --> 45:24.833
You'll have an ace up your sleeve.

45:33.541 --> 45:35.416
You'll do a magic trick.

45:42.625 --> 45:44.625
That's why we go back in the lion's den.

45:50.416 --> 45:52.500
Even if they point tons of guns at us.

45:57.375 --> 45:59.000
Because we believe in you.

46:01.166 --> 46:02.166
Like a mantra.

46:03.333 --> 46:05.708
Professor!

46:15.750 --> 46:16.833
You're our faith.

46:20.166 --> 46:22.458
We have faith that,
even if all else fails,

46:24.333 --> 46:25.583
we'll still have you.

46:27.875 --> 46:29.750
No matter how bad things get…

46:31.750 --> 46:33.041
even if they've beaten us,

46:34.250 --> 46:37.250
even if it looks like there's no hope,
like we're almost dead…

46:39.416 --> 46:40.666
we'll still believe.

46:45.041 --> 46:47.416
We know we'll always have the Professor.

46:48.083 --> 46:51.208
Professor!

50:08.958 --> 50:11.833
