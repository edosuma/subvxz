WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:11.920
[electric crackling]

00:15.840 --> 00:17.640
[electronic grunting]

00:17.720 --> 00:20.360
And Mangle dodges
Crusher's Crushumba-chop!

00:20.440 --> 00:21.720
What a move!

00:21.800 --> 00:23.200
He's going in for the score!

00:23.280 --> 00:24.600
Nothing can stop him now!

00:25.120 --> 00:26.960
[grunts] Huh?

00:32.440 --> 00:34.680
No more fun and games!

00:34.760 --> 00:37.120
[whimpers]

00:38.560 --> 00:39.760
Papa! Papa!

00:44.000 --> 00:46.200
Commander Vermis,
what are you doing here?

00:46.280 --> 00:50.400
It's pay day, the day this camp pays me!

00:50.480 --> 00:52.560
But our taxes aren't due until next week.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.840
I happened to be in the neighbourhood.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.480
But I could come back
when it's more convenient.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.880
Of course, if I do,
your taxes will be tripled.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.000
You can't do that!

01:02.080 --> 01:03.800
We're barely getting by as it is!

01:03.880 --> 01:05.640
Oh, you'll find a way.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.960
You always do.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.960
-It's outrageous!
-We won't pay!

01:10.560 --> 01:14.000
Oh, you'll pay, one way or another.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.040
You can't scare us, not anymore.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.600
Erm, Commander?

01:32.680 --> 01:35.480
A harvest workbot? How quaint.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.680
Release the venom bots.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.560
What's the saying?

01:46.640 --> 01:51.160
The bigger they are...

01:51.240 --> 01:52.240
Run!

01:57.720 --> 01:59.600
Lock down that containment unit!

02:02.280 --> 02:05.720
I can see that you're busy,
but I'll be back next week.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.760
Next time, I might not be
in such a forgiving mood.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.360
And I won't either.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.280
[whimpers]

02:14.360 --> 02:15.280
[clears throat]

02:18.080 --> 02:22.480
All right, the containment unit
is stabilised. All is clear.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.160
For now, but look at this place.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.680
How will we ever scrape up
enough money to pay Vermis?

02:29.760 --> 02:31.360
Oh, it's impossible!

02:31.440 --> 02:33.440
Nothing can save us now.

02:59.240 --> 03:02.560
[crowd chant] Robozuna! Robozuna!

03:02.640 --> 03:04.880
Robo-Robozuna!

03:04.960 --> 03:09.160
Listen to those Robozuna fans
ready for the exciting tie-breaker round

03:09.240 --> 03:12.840
between Team Blata and Team Veredus!

03:12.920 --> 03:17.760
So far it's been a seesaw battle
and this place is really rockin'!

03:17.840 --> 03:21.960
It sure is, Slick!
And that's because this arena floor tilts!

03:22.040 --> 03:24.680
You never know which way it's going to go!

03:24.760 --> 03:28.480
That's right, Spanner!
Let's look at the replay from round two!

03:28.560 --> 03:30.800
Team Veredus' Combatabot Spark
had the ball,

03:30.880 --> 03:33.600
but Team Blata's Dent wasn't giving up.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.480
That's Dent-a-tainment! Den-den-den-den!

03:37.560 --> 03:39.760
[mutters and groans]

03:40.320 --> 03:41.400
[groans]

03:41.480 --> 03:44.320
[Spanner] Oh! Clean-up on aisle four!

03:47.040 --> 03:50.000
[Slick] Team Blata's Clout
recovered the ball!

03:50.080 --> 03:52.040
[grunts]

03:53.800 --> 03:55.800
And he scored!

03:55.880 --> 04:00.960
Oh, yeah! It's going to take skill
and balance to win this final round.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.040
Woo-hoo!

04:05.320 --> 04:08.240
And now it's time for the final round.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.640
<i>The players are taking the field.</i>

04:11.040 --> 04:15.160
<i>For Team Veredus,</i>
<i>it's Combatabots Mangle and Clunk.</i>

04:15.240 --> 04:17.360
The Clunk-a-matic!

04:17.440 --> 04:21.560
-[Slick] <i>For Team Blata, it's Clout.</i>
-The floating Clout!

04:22.160 --> 04:25.760
-[Slick] <i>And Pulp.</i>
-Pulp gonna pulp-erise ya!

04:25.840 --> 04:28.840
Don't want to brag,
but I've got a secret weapon.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.080
-Really?
-Yup.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.880
No way Mangle's sliding off
that metal floor.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.120
I magnetised his feet.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.800
-Wow! Why didn't we think of that, Livia?
-Gee, I don't know, Chike.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.640
Maybe because
the floor's made of aluminum!

04:42.720 --> 04:45.760
And as any fool knows,
aluminum isn't magnetic!

04:46.120 --> 04:49.280
Oh, yeah. Sure, I knew that.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.240
[buzzer]

04:50.320 --> 04:52.600
[Slick] <i>Game on! Round three!</i>

05:00.560 --> 05:02.640
Pulp gonna pulp-erise ya!

05:06.680 --> 05:09.400
[Spanner] Oh! What a disarming move!

05:20.400 --> 05:23.600
Wow! Great defence by Team Veredus!

05:23.680 --> 05:27.360
But ding-dong!
Clunk really got his bell rung!

05:34.400 --> 05:37.120
Clunk! Play 350. Roller!

05:52.480 --> 05:53.960
Mangle taught him that.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.680
So much for magnetized feet.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.400
[Slick] <i>Hang on! What's Mangle doing?</i>

06:10.640 --> 06:14.000
[Spanner] <i>A lot of damage,</i>
<i>but it's still an uphill battle!</i>

06:19.280 --> 06:22.080
-[cheering]
-[Slick] <i>And Mangle scores!</i>

06:22.160 --> 06:25.120
<i>Team Veredus wins the game!</i>

06:27.080 --> 06:30.400
[gasps] Sounds like Mangle
made quite an impression.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.760
He sure did. Look at that floor.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.920
Hope I don't have to pay for it.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.880
Clunk got clunked.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.160
Everyone got pretty dinged up out there.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.920
Not me. I feel just f-f-f-fine!

06:48.560 --> 06:51.880
What I was afraid of. We've put
a lot of wear and tear on the team lately,

06:51.960 --> 06:55.960
what with our gruelling road schedule
and our extracurricular activities.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.960
Extra what?

06:58.040 --> 06:59.840
He means the hero stuff.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.760
You know, like when we're saving people,
fighting Corvus, being the good guys.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.400
Hero stuff. Good guys.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.920
Luckily, we're not scheduled to play
for another week,

07:10.000 --> 07:11.280
so we'll get some down time.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.000
[Ariston whoops]

07:13.080 --> 07:15.640
-Vacation!
-Vacation?

07:15.720 --> 07:18.480
It's when you get to chill,
goof off and do nothing.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.760
And how's that different
from what you do every day?

07:21.840 --> 07:22.920
[chuckles]

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Livia make joke!

07:24.080 --> 07:26.920
[Livia] <i>And how's that different</i>
<i>from what you do every day?</i>

07:27.000 --> 07:29.520
Yeah, yeah. I heard it the first time.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.520
This will not be a vacation. We need
this time to make repairs and rest up.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.520
Keep working while I go into town
to scrounge up some parts.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.840
Right, boss man!

07:38.600 --> 07:39.480
Whoa!

07:43.560 --> 07:45.400
[chuckles nervously] Magnetised feet.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.600
Oops.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.880
[groans] Why me?

07:58.360 --> 08:03.800
Pistons! Servos!
Get your pistons and servos right here!

08:03.880 --> 08:07.040
Rafie, you old pack rat,
what brings you here?

08:07.120 --> 08:10.280
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were following us around.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.560
Well, you are my best customers.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.040
And who else is going to sell parts
for those broken-down wrecks of yours?

08:17.120 --> 08:20.400
-Surely not Corvus.
-Definitely not Corvus.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.280
No, Papa! You can't sell Fizz!
He's my best friend!

08:27.360 --> 08:28.840
We've got no choice, son.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.800
If we don't raise money to pay off Vermis,
the Centurions will destroy our camp.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.320
We'll have nothing.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.560
What about those guys?
Maybe they can help us.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.920
Those are outlaws.
They only help themselves.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.360
Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.
You want to sell this workbot?

08:45.680 --> 08:48.040
-No!
-Yes! Yes, we do.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.120
Just what I've been looking for.
I don't have the money on me now,

08:51.200 --> 08:55.160
but if you let me know where your camp is,
I'll come by later to pay and pick him up.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.240
It's a deal.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.400
[sighs]

09:03.080 --> 09:06.680
So, where's this phantom buyer
you met in the marketplace?

09:07.120 --> 09:09.480
I don't know.
He should’ve been here by now.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.840
Papa, look!

09:13.840 --> 09:17.840
-A Corvus transporter.
-And we still don't have any money.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.720
Stay back. I'll handle this.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.560
[engine roars and brakes screech]

09:30.080 --> 09:31.400
[coughs]

09:36.480 --> 09:38.880
That's right. Hold your applause.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.080
Oh, great. Outlaws!

09:41.160 --> 09:44.080
If you want to rob us,
you'll have to get in line behind Corvus.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.400
We're not outlaws! We're the good guys.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.880
Yes, good guys. Hero stuff.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.920
We may not look like much,
but we've fought Corvus before.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.600
We are here to he-help... [yells]

09:57.880 --> 10:00.240
Uh, has anyone got a spare rheostat chip?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.360
See, Papa? I knew they could help.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.440
Guess we don't have much choice.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.200
You’re our only chance.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.560
Oops.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
We're doomed.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.720
Okay, here's the plan.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.840
We're going to teach you how to stand up
to Vermis and his Centurions.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.960
And we're going to start by having Mang...

10:27.600 --> 10:30.480
uh, Big M show your workbots how to fight.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.200
Uh, where are your workbots?

10:33.280 --> 10:34.400
Right in front of you.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.320
We use them
for scrubbing out the containment tanks.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.600
Don't you have anything... bigger?

10:45.160 --> 10:47.800
We did, but Vermis destroyed him.

10:48.120 --> 10:51.280
Swell. Not what I'd hoped for,
but this could work.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.600
Workbots, line up!

10:53.200 --> 10:55.560
[electronic chittering]

10:58.120 --> 11:00.320
[electronic whining]

11:01.560 --> 11:04.880
Now, let's say he's a Corvus Centurion.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.040
What's the first thing you'd do?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.120
[growls]

11:11.200 --> 11:14.240
[electronic muttering and squealing]

11:15.400 --> 11:18.760
Okay. Don't suppose you've got a plan B?

11:19.160 --> 11:21.800
[electronic squealing]

11:22.560 --> 11:24.320
How many containment tanks have you got?

11:25.080 --> 11:26.640
Six. Why?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.320
Think I may have an idea.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.360
Mm.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.640
[grunts]

11:43.720 --> 11:45.920
[electronic gibbering]

11:47.640 --> 11:48.560
[groans]

11:49.200 --> 11:51.280
[grunts and groans]

11:58.320 --> 11:59.440
[electronic squeal]

12:02.200 --> 12:03.040
[thud]

12:04.200 --> 12:05.280
Oops!

12:13.600 --> 12:16.160
[electronic gibbering]

12:36.760 --> 12:39.720
So, do you think
your idea's going to work?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.200
We're about to find out.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.280
[roar]

12:46.240 --> 12:48.320
Isn't there any way to avoid a fight?

12:48.400 --> 12:51.200
What if we gave Vermis
some of our workbots as payment?

12:51.280 --> 12:54.080
It's your choice.
You can let Vermis continue to bully you,

12:54.160 --> 12:57.160
or you can stand up,
help put an end to this tyranny.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.520
He's right. You know he is.
This has to end now.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.400
All of you, take cover.
Wait for my signal.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.680
[exhales]

13:15.360 --> 13:17.800
I told you I'd be back for my money.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.440
And we told you we don't have any.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.720
Aw, that's too bad.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.800
[Ariston ]Yeah, too bad for you!

13:26.560 --> 13:28.120
Don't say it. I know.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.760
Forgot to wait for the signal.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.120
Again.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.640
I'm surprised, Gregor.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.360
You know the penalty
for harbouring known criminals.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.320
You're the only criminal here,
taking what belongs to others

13:45.400 --> 13:48.240
and calling it a tax,
one we can’t afford.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.680
Commander,
perhaps you could ask her highness

13:51.760 --> 13:54.000
to lower the tax, temporarily, of course.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.560
Ha! Danuvia doesn't even know
about this tax.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.440
Her highness doesn't know about the tax?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.760
Think of it as my monthly bonus.

14:05.840 --> 14:10.680
Danuvia doesn't need to know
that I've dipped into her collection box.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.640
Keep your mouth shut, Sergeant.
You'll get your share, too.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.480
Whatever you say, Commander.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.640
I'll make you a deal.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.080
There's a substantial reward
for these outlaws.

14:23.160 --> 14:28.000
Hand them over and we'll be square
on your taxes for the rest of the year.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.640
-A reward?
-No taxes?

14:29.720 --> 14:31.000
The rest of the year?

14:31.080 --> 14:32.840
No deal!

14:32.920 --> 14:35.800
They're our friends
and they're here to protect us!

14:35.880 --> 14:40.360
A pity. I was hoping to avoid
any unpleasantness,

14:40.440 --> 14:42.040
but you've left me no choice.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.160
See if you can't change their minds.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.160
[whimpers]

14:53.240 --> 14:54.560
Run!

15:02.320 --> 15:04.320
Everyone, fall back!

15:12.560 --> 15:13.440
Ready?

15:14.640 --> 15:16.040
-[bleeping]
-Light 'em up!

15:21.520 --> 15:22.400
What?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.520
Let her rip!

15:33.280 --> 15:34.640
Commander, look out!

15:45.040 --> 15:47.400
Unleash the venom bots!

15:51.080 --> 15:52.120
Behind you!

16:03.480 --> 16:04.480
Oh!

16:07.720 --> 16:09.480
Woo-hoo! Nice one!

16:11.680 --> 16:15.920
Impressive,
but ultimately a waste of time.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.840
You see, I too have a little surprise.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.920
[rumbling]

16:23.000 --> 16:24.200
-What's that?
-Thunder?

16:24.280 --> 16:25.560
Earthquake!

16:36.560 --> 16:38.160
Everyone, get back!

16:39.560 --> 16:40.840
[groaning]

16:41.960 --> 16:43.560
[cackles]

16:43.640 --> 16:44.800
Ready to give up?

16:47.160 --> 16:50.320
Give up? Ha! We don't know the meaning!

16:50.400 --> 16:54.800
"Give up" means yield, surrender,
concede, forgo.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.080
I know! I know! Forgo this!

17:03.440 --> 17:05.480
Whoa! Not a scratch.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.720
It's recharging. Get down!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.080
Run!

17:18.840 --> 17:19.800
Mama!

17:27.280 --> 17:28.320
Mama!

17:31.400 --> 17:33.200
[Ariston] Mang... Big M!

17:34.120 --> 17:35.360
Talk to me, buddy.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.120
I was afraid I'd lost you.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.400
Big M protect.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.360
[Vermis laughs]

17:49.720 --> 17:50.960
Finish them!

17:57.600 --> 17:59.960
Big M, your foot magnets!

18:10.160 --> 18:11.520
How'd he get there?

18:22.280 --> 18:25.080
Ha! That armour's triple reinforced!

18:25.560 --> 18:26.560
He can't hurt it.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.440
The cannon barrel! Hey!

18:31.440 --> 18:33.880
Play 350 Roller!

18:34.200 --> 18:35.880
Clunk got this!

18:45.040 --> 18:46.360
[laughs] Yes!

18:49.120 --> 18:51.200
What's he doing? Shake him off!

18:57.800 --> 19:01.280
Unbelievable!
He's sticking to it like glue!

19:15.480 --> 19:16.680
Score!

19:22.080 --> 19:23.080
[yelling]

19:26.360 --> 19:28.760
Robo-Robozuna!

19:29.920 --> 19:31.680
Get off me, you oaf!

19:31.760 --> 19:33.200
Sorry, Commander!

19:33.280 --> 19:35.040
You think you've won?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.760
I'll be back with even more Corvus forces.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.480
I'll destroy this pitiful camp!

19:40.560 --> 19:43.120
No. You not destroy.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.000
Destroy you!

19:45.080 --> 19:46.840
Ha! What do you know?

19:46.920 --> 19:49.080
You're just a brainless bot and--

19:49.160 --> 19:53.280
[Vermis] <i>Danuvia doesn’t need to know</i>
<i>that I've dipped into her collection box.</i>

19:53.800 --> 19:58.600
Whoa? You recorded that?
Not bad for a brainless bot.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.280
Ha! Stealing from the pockets of Corvus?

20:02.360 --> 20:05.920
I don't think Danuvia would appreciate
hearing that, do you, Commander?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.840
-I... I...
-Here's what's going to happen.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.920
You're going to leave this camp
and never come back. Understood?

20:12.280 --> 20:13.680
This isn't over.

20:13.760 --> 20:17.320
Someday, I'll get even
with you so-called heroes.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.360
How... how did he do that?

20:21.480 --> 20:24.120
Uh... Uh... Commander! Wait for me!

20:32.880 --> 20:34.360
My son was right about you.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.320
You really are heroes.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.400
Dustin! Has anyone seen him?

20:39.960 --> 20:43.120
You heard me, Vermis.
Don't ever mess with us heroes!

20:43.200 --> 20:45.560
Ha! We're the Freebot Fighters!

20:45.640 --> 20:48.200
-[Ariston] Freebot Fighters?
-Hm.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.800
There! Repaired and recharged!

20:53.880 --> 20:58.360
Spark. Get close, you're toast!
The taser-jab!

20:59.680 --> 21:02.160
-We're back.
-How'd it go at the marketplace?

21:02.240 --> 21:04.640
Great! We were able to trade
the lightning module

21:04.720 --> 21:07.720
that the harvesters gave us
for almost everything we needed.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.760
Ariston was right.
Maybe this whole hero thing is worth it!

21:10.840 --> 21:12.400
Oh! Who knew?

21:12.480 --> 21:14.840
Uh, where is Ariston?

21:18.720 --> 21:23.480
See? This... this is the kind of vacation
I'm talking about.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.320
Hm. Vacation good.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.720
Huh?

21:34.560 --> 21:35.440
Oops!

21:36.400 --> 21:37.240
Oh.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.920
Ah, yeah.
