WEBVTT

00:11.405 --> 00:14.245
<i>Too late! Impact! Impact!</i>

00:14.645 --> 00:16.925
- See that? What if it's ours?
-Our what?

00:17.205 --> 00:18.165
Drone, maybe.

00:18.245 --> 00:20.965
You need to call your dad.
Tell him you're in Hawaii.

00:22.685 --> 00:25.525
-Tell me about Pale Horse.
-I will not go down for this.

00:25.605 --> 00:29.165
This is the exact type of weapon
used by Catriona Bailey's killer.

00:29.245 --> 00:31.685
Is Sami dealing black market ADF weapons?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.365
I can't do this anymore. Sorry.

00:33.445 --> 00:35.725
<i>Do you honestly think</i>
<i>that's an option for you?</i>

00:36.045 --> 00:38.765
<i>This compromises me.</i>
<i>It compromises us.</i>

00:40.605 --> 00:42.525
I said come alone or the deal was off.

00:42.885 --> 00:43.765
Mustafa.

00:46.565 --> 00:50.485
<i>Surely, Minister, this video exposes</i>
<i>what appears to be a massive cover-up.</i>

00:50.725 --> 00:53.125
Kill missions?
Without my knowledge or authority!

00:53.205 --> 00:56.405
The alliance is a matter of contention.
That includes Pine Gap.

00:56.485 --> 00:58.285
And you winning the balance of power

00:58.365 --> 01:01.005
-on Saturday is not beyond the realms.
- God.

01:01.285 --> 01:02.725
Casey's just won Bailey's seat.

01:02.805 --> 01:05.005
You're not gonna resign?
Things are getting interesting.
So, when I come back out,
will you still be here?

01:11.605 --> 01:12.565
Yeah, I'll be here.

01:39.805 --> 01:41.525
Why do you bother even setting it?

01:43.085 --> 01:47.205
You always have your hand poised,
waiting for it to go off.

01:48.725 --> 01:50.245
Just a habit I can't break.

01:59.925 --> 02:01.845
Did you check the hospital last night?

02:02.565 --> 02:03.965
He was post-op.

02:05.285 --> 02:06.845
Bullet missed his vital organs.

02:12.485 --> 02:16.085
We have his money
and his weapons, William.

02:18.165 --> 02:20.765
-What if he--
-I'm the head of a federal agency, Helen.

02:21.805 --> 02:25.245
He's smart.
He'll know what a warning looks like.

02:32.325 --> 02:33.565
You really believe that?

04:04.765 --> 04:08.045
Prime Minister, do you have
any comment regarding Pale Horse?

04:09.045 --> 04:12.685
Prime Minister Garrity,
Mr. Secretary of Defense.

04:13.205 --> 04:14.405
Mr. Secretary.

04:14.485 --> 04:16.045
-Prime Minister.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.325
How was the flight?

04:17.405 --> 04:19.565
Twenty-two hours
in a padded cell in the sky

04:19.645 --> 04:22.964
is a small price to pay to be here
in your beautiful country, Ewan.

04:23.165 --> 04:27.285
- Is the US responsible for--
-Pleasure's all ours. Please.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.605
- Do you follow the NBA?
- Can't say I do.

04:33.685 --> 04:37.525
Well, got a story for you.
My team made the playoffs last year.

04:38.205 --> 04:41.725
Last game, tie score,
ten seconds left on the buzzer.

04:42.005 --> 04:45.445
Our point guard saves the ball
on the baseline...

04:46.245 --> 04:49.645
looks the other way, throws it back
in court, behind his back...

04:50.485 --> 04:52.845
scores the winning basket.

04:53.645 --> 04:54.925
One in a million shot.

04:56.205 --> 04:58.285
Trouble is, it's the other team's basket.

05:00.845 --> 05:04.205
It's hard to play for your own team when
you don't know what game's being played.

05:08.805 --> 05:13.805
Ewan, our alliance is vital to peace
in the Pacific region.

05:14.365 --> 05:18.165
I'm here to offer my sincere apologies
for the lack for transparency.

05:18.965 --> 05:23.245
Now, security measures were in place
to protect you and key strategic sites.

05:23.325 --> 05:26.565
Where were the security measures when four
Australians were murdered in their beds?

05:27.325 --> 05:28.965
I wasn't the one who needed protecting.

05:29.805 --> 05:33.085
Trebuchet has been supplying us
with hardware for two decades.

05:33.605 --> 05:36.325
-Their products are proven.
-So you think it's a security breach?

05:36.405 --> 05:40.005
Our enemies are rummaging around
in our digital drawers all the time.

05:40.085 --> 05:41.485
It doesn't pay to surmise.

05:42.365 --> 05:47.085
But given that possibility, grounding
Pale Horse may not be the wisest move.

05:47.165 --> 05:50.925
Let me be clear, Mr. Secretary, until
we find the drone and get confirmation

05:51.005 --> 05:54.565
on what the hell happened up there,
Pale Horse is grounded.

05:57.965 --> 06:00.845
Well, then we better find
that fucking drone.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.565
Davoren Park's
in Karen Koutoufides' electorate.

06:14.645 --> 06:18.445
She knew the Lambert family. She believes
that the public has a right to know

06:18.525 --> 06:21.365
where Pale Horse is running
their training operations.

06:21.445 --> 06:25.165
I'm afraid that the information that Ms.
Koutoufides is requesting is classified.

06:25.845 --> 06:28.805
And as I'm sure you know,
Pale Horse has been suspended.

06:29.645 --> 06:32.205
Then where was Pale Horse
test-dropping their bombs?

06:32.805 --> 06:34.765
Like I said, classified.

06:36.965 --> 06:38.525
Did you know the Minister well?

06:40.045 --> 06:41.005
Mm.

06:44.005 --> 06:47.485
Four days after Davoren Park, she was
murdered with a stolen military weapon.

06:52.685 --> 06:56.565
Did you have any 9mm Berettas
in your cache, Major?

07:00.325 --> 07:03.205
If you did, there's a high chance
Bailey's murder weapon

07:03.285 --> 07:06.685
can be traced back to your little trade
arrangement with the Almasis.

07:10.445 --> 07:11.285
Thank you, Martin.

07:15.605 --> 07:18.885
Do you have any proof of this unfounded
and litigious accusation?

07:24.565 --> 07:25.525
Didn't think so.

07:58.205 --> 07:59.045
Lockwood.
Where is she?

08:04.085 --> 08:05.005
Cal's safe.

08:07.725 --> 08:09.165
She had to be assessed, Joe.

08:10.485 --> 08:14.045
Her mental health's been compromised.
She needs medication, counseling.
Given her history, she can't be
left alone... for her own safety.

08:18.325 --> 08:21.445
After five years, why do you suddenly
give a fuck about Cal's mental health?

08:21.525 --> 08:23.245
I could ask you the same question.

08:26.165 --> 08:30.365
Listen, Joe. If the public gets
hold of Cal's medical history,

08:30.445 --> 08:32.045
they'll blame her
for what's happened.

08:32.605 --> 08:36.845
She'll be the most reviled person in the
country. We have to protect her from that.

08:38.564 --> 08:42.285
We contain this, contain her
until she's strong enough to cope.

08:44.405 --> 08:45.485
I owe her that much.

08:46.564 --> 08:47.564
We both do.

08:50.845 --> 08:53.085
If you'll excuse me,
I've got a meeting at Russell.

08:54.165 --> 08:55.685
You didn't answer my question.

08:57.325 --> 08:58.245
Where is she?

08:59.285 --> 09:01.365
Just remember who you're talking to, son.

09:12.045 --> 09:13.045
Sullivan.

09:13.125 --> 09:17.725
That woman that you went looking for
at Davoren Park, the one in the CCTV photo

09:17.805 --> 09:19.405
that I saw in your room...

09:21.645 --> 09:22.645
What about her?

09:23.765 --> 09:24.885
I know where she is.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.045
<i>Where?</i>

09:29.645 --> 09:32.045
-What do you want, Harriet?
<i>-Who is she?</i>

09:33.005 --> 09:34.165
<i>Is she the drone pilot?</i>

09:37.765 --> 09:39.925
So, why were you looking for her?
Did she go AWOL?

09:41.405 --> 09:43.085
Tell me where you saw her, Harri.

09:45.445 --> 09:46.445
Defense.

10:00.165 --> 10:01.045
Miss Treloar.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.645
Ewan Garrity. Please.

10:06.765 --> 10:07.645
Where's Lockwood?

10:09.045 --> 10:10.965
Uh, this will be more of an informal chat.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.485
You're the prime minister, sir.

10:14.565 --> 10:17.085
-How informal can it be?
-I've read your statement,

10:17.165 --> 10:21.405
but I'd like to hear what happened...
from the Pale Horse's mouth, as it were.

10:23.205 --> 10:26.085
You were there, Cal, in the chair.
You must have seen--

10:26.165 --> 10:29.005
I wasn't there, sir. I'm never there.
I was 500 kilometers away.

10:33.165 --> 10:36.125
You've been running kill missions
to Pakistan. Is that correct?

10:36.205 --> 10:37.605
That's not what you tell the public.

10:40.165 --> 10:41.005
No.

10:42.965 --> 10:46.845
In my line of work, sometimes you have
to be more selective with what you say,

10:46.925 --> 10:48.605
if you want to live to fight another day.

10:50.605 --> 10:53.525
It strikes me that drones
are essentially flying computers.

10:54.245 --> 10:59.085
You don't think, uh, an enemy hack
is possible? Revenge perhaps?

10:59.165 --> 11:00.445
That's not what happened.

11:01.805 --> 11:05.085
Since the program's been running, how many
innocent Pakistanis have been killed?

11:08.685 --> 11:10.205
It was under your orders, sir.

11:14.525 --> 11:17.085
You and I sit in rooms...

11:17.925 --> 11:20.325
far away from where
real lives take place...

11:21.685 --> 11:23.765
making decisions that affect those lives.

11:26.485 --> 11:30.165
But above us, beyond the room,
outside of our control...

11:31.565 --> 11:34.525
there are people who make decisions
that affect us.

11:38.885 --> 11:40.605
Don't you want to know
what really happened?

11:44.325 --> 11:46.765
It was done to you, it was done to me...

11:47.885 --> 11:50.205
and it was done
to that family in Davoren Park.

11:56.645 --> 11:58.365
Everything I know is in my statement, sir.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.245
Well, if you think of anything else,
Cal...

12:11.165 --> 12:12.085
let me know.

12:42.605 --> 12:46.285
- Sir, we've located the drone.
- <i>What about the data brick?</i>

12:46.365 --> 12:47.685
I'm afraid it's gone, sir.

12:48.965 --> 12:50.245
How is that possible?

12:52.405 --> 12:55.605
<i>Secretary of Defense Richard</i>
<i>Gascoigne arrived in Parliament House</i>

12:55.685 --> 12:58.365
<i>to a warm welcome</i>
<i>from Prime Minister Garrity.</i>

12:58.645 --> 13:00.965
<i>The unexpected visit</i>
<i>to the nation's capital...</i>

13:01.045 --> 13:01.885
Morning.

13:02.885 --> 13:05.485
-The phones have been running so hot, KK.
-Huh.

13:05.565 --> 13:06.885
Karen Koutoufides' office.

13:06.965 --> 13:10.245
<i>...overseeing a top-secret</i>
<i>military training exercise...</i>

13:10.325 --> 13:14.245
Something's got the Yanks' wind up. These
visits are planned months in advance.

13:14.325 --> 13:16.845
Makes you wonder why the
Secretary of Defense would get on a plane

13:16.925 --> 13:18.805
the day after Pale Horse goes public.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.005
It's not like it's their skin in the game.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.885
-Something's going on.
- <i>...unmanned aerial vehicle</i>

13:25.965 --> 13:29.765
<i>as a new-technology drone,</i>
<i>rushed into production and operation.</i>

13:30.085 --> 13:33.005
<i>These allegations</i>
<i>were put to the Minister's office today,</i>

13:33.085 --> 13:35.285
<i>but no official response</i>
<i>has been provided.</i>

13:36.205 --> 13:40.325
<i>To overseas news now, and Downing Street</i>
<i>called an urgent cabinet meeting</i>

13:40.405 --> 13:44.325
<i>to approve Britain's response</i>
<i>to the escalating crisis in Syria,</i>

13:44.405 --> 13:47.565
<i>amid concerns</i>
<i>the UK will launch military action...</i>

13:47.645 --> 13:49.925
Hey, Declan, you still seeing
that girl from Home Affairs?

13:50.845 --> 13:51.765
Why?

13:51.845 --> 13:54.925
Do you think she'd know
the password to Bailey's social media?

13:55.245 --> 13:56.765
Out of the question, Harriet.

13:58.845 --> 13:59.725
Why?

14:05.485 --> 14:07.365
-We shouldn't be doing this.
-Relax.
Bailey's dead. She's not gonna hurt you.

14:12.965 --> 14:13.965
Right, you're in.

14:15.405 --> 14:18.325
So, can we go into her private messages?

14:28.285 --> 14:30.245
What's with all the Oliver Choi ads?

14:31.005 --> 14:33.205
She gets no spam except for those.

14:34.245 --> 14:35.365
I'm not getting involved.

15:02.685 --> 15:07.165
We are waiting on their demands. I'm sure
you're aware these negotiations take time.

15:08.205 --> 15:11.365
Uh, we need to get Markson out of there,
Mr. Ambassador.

15:11.445 --> 15:14.085
Of course, but these situations
require delicacy.

15:14.165 --> 15:17.725
Mr. Ambassador, the situation
in Waziristan is potentially volatile.

15:18.925 --> 15:21.205
There may have been a breach
in the security of our drone--

15:21.285 --> 15:23.245
-No one's saying that.
-I'm just saying.

15:23.325 --> 15:25.885
-It's still under investigation.

15:25.965 --> 15:26.925
Hellier.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.685
Prime Minister,
why would anyone be interested

15:30.765 --> 15:34.605
in hacking a drone that was only employed
for military exercises?

15:34.685 --> 15:36.245
It's still under investigation.

15:36.325 --> 15:39.805
If you're accusing Haqqani of hacking it,
surely they would've have claimed it?

15:40.445 --> 15:43.565
For decades, my country has put up
with your war that is not a war,

15:43.645 --> 15:47.645
but trust me, Prime Minister, if you send
combat troops into North Waziristan...

15:47.965 --> 15:50.525
my government will treat
that as an act of invasion.

15:52.285 --> 15:56.085
Uh, Prime Minister...
they've found the location of the drone.

16:13.645 --> 16:15.045
You wanted her to be safe.

16:19.205 --> 16:20.325
I'll leave you to it.

16:35.205 --> 16:36.205
You okay?

16:39.285 --> 16:42.245
-You're with them... is that what this is?
-No.

16:47.845 --> 16:48.845
Cal, come here.
Fuck!

16:58.805 --> 16:59.965
Who do you want to call?

17:00.045 --> 17:01.285
Where's your computer?

17:03.845 --> 17:05.805
-Cal, calm down.
-They're lying, okay?

17:05.885 --> 17:07.125
Who's lying?

17:09.285 --> 17:11.084
Everyone's lying about everything.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.324
-Where is it?
-You need to sit down.

17:15.405 --> 17:17.285
Talk to me. Tell me what's going on.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.245
The people who died...

17:31.685 --> 17:33.245
-It's okay.

17:37.245 --> 17:38.405
-It's okay.

17:45.005 --> 17:46.405
It's okay. Just breathe.

17:51.565 --> 17:52.805
Just breathe.

18:42.565 --> 18:43.565
Good to go.

18:51.765 --> 18:53.445
Dunkley, good to go.

19:26.445 --> 19:28.645
Jesus Christ, Mina.
Like, what were you thinking?

19:34.565 --> 19:37.685
You were a fugitive and you found time
to run a stolen weapons business.

19:37.765 --> 19:38.965
That's fucking enterprising.

19:39.045 --> 19:42.325
-How do you know about that?
-I was your courier. Did you forget that?

19:44.925 --> 19:46.805
-You went to the handover.
-Yeah.

19:48.365 --> 19:50.405
-Sami, is he okay?
-Oh, he'll survive.

19:53.085 --> 19:54.965
I want you to tell me about Helen Wu.

19:56.205 --> 19:58.925
I give info on Sami's contacts
to the screws...

20:00.445 --> 20:02.245
and Aliah has neither of her parents.

20:02.325 --> 20:05.325
Aliah gets her mother back
if we find out who killed Bailey.

20:09.645 --> 20:11.125
So, Helen knew Bailey, right?

20:11.605 --> 20:14.325
And Bailey's killed
with a military-issue 9-millimeter.

20:16.725 --> 20:20.685
So, if Helen found out
that Bailey was trading secrets...

20:23.165 --> 20:24.565
military secrets...

20:37.885 --> 20:40.765
Why the fuck won't you help me,
Mina? I thought we were friends.

20:40.845 --> 20:43.605
- You are my friend, Harriet.
- Almasi.

20:44.605 --> 20:47.845
-No contact.
-You need to get me out of here.

20:48.405 --> 20:51.845
How do I get to Helen Wu,
'cause she won't let me back in Defense?

20:51.925 --> 20:53.205
You want to get to her?

20:54.765 --> 20:55.925
You know her husband.

20:56.685 --> 20:58.005
William Vaughn.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.165
Evening, Major.

21:18.005 --> 21:23.485
It's a nice suburb, Yarralumla.
Lowest crime rate in Canberra, apparently.

21:28.005 --> 21:31.045
The shooter at the civic car park,
the one who had your back, who is he?

21:31.765 --> 21:33.805
-Is it your husband?
-What's going on?

21:37.765 --> 21:39.085
She knows about the car park.
What do you want, Harriet?

21:52.245 --> 21:53.645
What did you see last night?

21:58.725 --> 22:01.725
I saw a weapons exchange with Sami Almasi.

22:04.205 --> 22:05.245
One fatality.

22:08.085 --> 22:10.485
What were you thinking, Vaughn?
You're not a field agent.

22:11.245 --> 22:13.365
-Your wife could've been killed.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.965
I don't understand anyway.
Why would she be doing it?

22:19.045 --> 22:20.205
What's she got to gain?

22:24.205 --> 22:25.165
Nothing.
She's a gambler.

22:28.965 --> 22:30.245
You only ever lose.

22:34.605 --> 22:35.605
What you saw...

22:37.605 --> 22:38.485
it's over.

22:42.205 --> 22:43.325
I need your word.

22:45.325 --> 22:46.885
I need to find Bailey's killer.

22:49.365 --> 22:50.525
You help me to...

22:52.085 --> 22:54.405
to decrypt a file
that could lead me to them...

22:55.685 --> 22:58.405
I won't expose your wife
for selling the murder weapon.

23:12.165 --> 23:13.005
There.

23:19.205 --> 23:21.525
I'm going to have to brute-force this.
Might take a while.

23:25.565 --> 23:26.405
Okay.

23:51.005 --> 23:52.645
That was you in Davoren Park, wasn't it?

23:53.925 --> 23:55.685
That night, in the house across the road.

23:59.485 --> 24:00.845
I had to see it for myself.

24:02.245 --> 24:04.325
Like an arsonist
returning to the scene of the crime.

24:08.365 --> 24:11.685
-You think I lit the fire?
-No, of course not.

24:15.085 --> 24:16.245
What were you doing there?

24:18.005 --> 24:18.885
Instinct.

24:20.485 --> 24:24.445
Sitting in a dark room with a joystick,
hundreds of ks away, that's not you.

24:26.725 --> 24:28.845
I knew you'd need to see
ground zero for yourself.

24:33.485 --> 24:34.765
Cal, what happened?

24:35.365 --> 24:37.205
Freak accident? One-off?

24:43.405 --> 24:46.045
-I need to use your computer.
-You need to rest, recuperate.

24:46.125 --> 24:48.685
-You've had an episode.
-No, I haven't. Just...
-Give me your computer.
-God, you have not changed.

25:04.125 --> 25:05.085
I'll get it.

26:08.045 --> 26:10.565
I'm not sick, Sully.
What did they tell you? I'm...

26:17.045 --> 26:18.325
I'm not sick.

26:46.565 --> 26:48.405
Jesus Christ.

26:54.645 --> 26:55.645
Miramshah.

26:57.285 --> 27:00.285
That's the, uh...
That's the ambushed safe house, isn't it?

27:02.085 --> 27:03.445
Bailey sent it to Beijing.

27:04.965 --> 27:05.845
MSS?

27:06.765 --> 27:07.805
Right?

27:12.605 --> 27:13.925
I knew she was a spy.

27:15.965 --> 27:17.925
The question is, why didn't any of you?

27:21.205 --> 27:22.645
This doesn't leave the room.

27:24.565 --> 27:27.725
There's a 20-year sentence
for leaking classified information.

27:27.805 --> 27:30.125
-You can't do anything with this.
-I can't.

27:32.125 --> 27:33.165
But you can.

27:35.045 --> 27:37.365
I mean, aren't you sick of the shadows,
Vaughn?

30:55.605 --> 30:57.445
9-8-8-1...

31:16.765 --> 31:18.645
So, did you find the drone pilot yet?

31:23.125 --> 31:25.405
That was your mission, wasn't it?
To find her.

31:26.005 --> 31:28.165
You got another reason why
you were sent to Davoren Park,

31:28.245 --> 31:30.005
or why Catriona Bailey called you
that night?
Is this a drink or an inquisition?

31:32.205 --> 31:35.605
Well, it seems to me that she's the only
one who knows what happened that night

31:35.685 --> 31:38.925
and Defense are making damn sure
that she doesn't talk about it.

31:39.005 --> 31:41.205
I deal in facts, not conspiracy theories.

31:44.045 --> 31:45.565
Okay, fine. Here's a fact.

31:47.085 --> 31:49.165
You were in a safe house in Miramshah...

31:50.165 --> 31:51.485
and your cover got blown.

31:52.645 --> 31:53.605
Correct?

31:56.205 --> 31:59.125
-It was an ambush.
-Someone must have known you were there.

31:59.205 --> 32:02.005
-Somebody must have been trading intel.
-It's the tribal lands.

32:02.085 --> 32:04.445
You can buy
someone's grandmother for 50 cents.

32:04.525 --> 32:06.405
-Someone from your own side?
-No.

32:06.485 --> 32:09.245
-How would you know?
-There's no grand conspiracy here.

32:09.325 --> 32:11.925
-It's war. Shit happens.
-Yeah, but we're not at war.

32:12.925 --> 32:15.885
I get it, okay?
You want us to be on the same team.

32:16.965 --> 32:18.485
Conquer the bad guys together.

32:18.565 --> 32:19.805
Root out the corruption.

32:20.445 --> 32:22.725
You want a guy who's got your back,
a guy you can trust.

32:29.445 --> 32:31.445
Do you blame yourself
for what happened in Miramshah?

32:31.525 --> 32:33.885
-You don't know anything about it.
-So, tell me.

32:33.965 --> 32:34.885
Sure.

32:34.965 --> 32:38.365
Let's go back to my room,
hold each other and whisper our secrets.

32:38.445 --> 32:40.365
You've done that before, haven't you?

32:40.445 --> 32:41.565
Trusted the wrong guy.

32:42.365 --> 32:43.845
You should thank me for the warning.

32:47.445 --> 32:51.565
Tell me, if you knew
who gave away your safe house...

32:52.445 --> 32:56.925
who got your men killed and captured...
what would you do to them?

32:58.365 --> 32:59.685
I'd execute them.

33:02.285 --> 33:04.125
At night, from behind,

33:04.205 --> 33:05.685
so they didn't see it coming.

33:16.405 --> 33:17.325
Thank you.

33:43.365 --> 33:44.205
Hey.

33:44.805 --> 33:45.685
Hey.

34:10.765 --> 34:12.325
How's this for transparency?

34:44.885 --> 34:45.845
You fucked him yet?

34:49.045 --> 34:50.125
Actually, no.

34:50.885 --> 34:52.164
But you thought about it.

34:53.684 --> 34:54.885
Is that why you're here?

34:56.805 --> 34:58.164
You're a journalist, right?

34:59.285 --> 35:00.605
Yeah, in another life.

35:03.125 --> 35:04.845
Have you got something
you want to tell me...

35:06.285 --> 35:08.565
about why you went on the run
after the bomb?

35:19.085 --> 35:20.325
I didn't go on the run.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.125
They were chasing me,
trying to shut me up.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.605
Who were? The military?

35:25.685 --> 35:26.885
Why would they do that?

35:28.645 --> 35:32.325
They didn't want it getting out
we were running kill missions to Pakistan.

35:32.885 --> 35:35.805
-What? The RAAF were running missions?

35:36.285 --> 35:37.925
The Air Force wouldn't touch me.

35:39.405 --> 35:42.845
He told them I was too sick for
the service. He signed the affidavit.

35:42.925 --> 35:44.485
-Who?
-Sully.

35:45.485 --> 35:47.565
-Why would Sullivan do that?
-Because he's my husband.

35:50.285 --> 35:52.485
If you don't work for the Air Force,
who do you work for?

35:58.805 --> 36:01.245
Have you got proof of these kill missions?

36:02.365 --> 36:03.405
I'm going to get it.

36:07.125 --> 36:09.645
I don't mind, by the way.
You can fuck him, but...

36:11.485 --> 36:12.565
don't ever trust him.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.045
Can I use your bathroom?

36:15.325 --> 36:16.165
Sure.

36:52.565 --> 36:53.445
Cal?

37:05.605 --> 37:06.605
Fuck!

37:20.565 --> 37:21.605
Hey, Karen.

37:21.685 --> 37:24.805
Do you reckon you could get on the
Committee for Security and Intelligence?

37:25.085 --> 37:26.405
Not a shit show in hell.

37:26.485 --> 37:27.485
Okay.

37:27.565 --> 37:32.285
So, Pale Horse has been running
kill missions in Pakistan.

37:32.365 --> 37:34.325
That's why the Americans are here.

37:35.565 --> 37:36.565
Jeez.

37:37.445 --> 37:38.285
Shit.

37:40.485 --> 37:41.645
You got proof of that?

37:42.925 --> 37:46.165
I don't, but if you get on that committee,
I think maybe you could get some.

38:52.325 --> 38:53.485
Where is my money?

38:55.325 --> 38:56.685
Where are my weapons?

39:00.485 --> 39:01.725
You can't have both.

39:34.085 --> 39:35.085
Hm!

40:29.845 --> 40:32.405
There's never been an independent
on that committee.

40:32.485 --> 40:35.565
-This is the time.
-I can offer you Energy and Environment

40:35.645 --> 40:38.805
-or Industry and Innovation.
-I want Intelligence and Security.

40:38.885 --> 40:41.565
It's just routine briefings
from heads of security.

40:41.645 --> 40:44.005
-You'd have far more input on--
-I owe it to my electorate

40:44.085 --> 40:47.125
to explain to them
why drones doing training exercises

40:47.205 --> 40:50.765
-are dropping bombs in their backyards.
-Mm.

40:50.845 --> 40:52.405
Or were they doing something else?

40:53.405 --> 40:55.445
You think you can come in here
and threaten me?

40:55.525 --> 40:58.645
My constituents want to know the truth
about Pale Horse.

41:01.765 --> 41:03.765
-Thanks for coming by, Karen.
-Ewan...

41:05.085 --> 41:07.525
I thought you wanted my support
on confidence and supply.

41:07.605 --> 41:10.565
Conway's pushing
your private member's bill through.

41:11.605 --> 41:13.605
I think our quid pro quo is up to date.

41:35.845 --> 41:41.285
Whatever you've got on me, on my wife,
I can get ten times as much on you.

41:42.765 --> 41:45.645
I've got access to equipment that can
read the label in your underpants.

41:47.965 --> 41:51.285
You go near my wife, or into my house...

41:52.565 --> 41:54.125
and your life will be over.

42:03.685 --> 42:04.845
Take 'em and fuck off.

42:06.445 --> 42:07.365
Mm.

42:07.845 --> 42:10.325
You will have to lift it for me. Hm?

42:12.125 --> 42:13.045
Oh.

42:13.125 --> 42:14.165
Doctor's orders.

42:57.645 --> 42:59.005
-What the fuck?
-I need it.

42:59.965 --> 43:01.365
-Get out of here now.
-Give it to me.

43:01.445 --> 43:03.885
Are you fucking crazy?
They'll have followed you.

43:11.405 --> 43:14.565
We've analyzed the ordered log records
from the data brick
and can confirm
that GPS spoofing techniques were used

43:17.885 --> 43:23.125
to relay false information to the UAV,
prior to its return to base.

43:23.205 --> 43:27.165
Iran did this to one of ours a couple
of years ago, but it didn't drop a bomb.
No, it's not been done before,
but once the ID device is hijacked,

43:31.285 --> 43:33.045
malicious commands can be sent.

43:33.125 --> 43:35.645
Does the circuitry data tell us
where the hack originated from?

43:37.485 --> 43:41.965
The...  ISP address
is in Islamabad.

43:42.725 --> 43:44.165
So, it's Haqqani.
No, Prime Minister.

43:47.165 --> 43:51.205
The server can be traced to ISI,
the Pakistani Secret Service.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.525
Jesus Christ!

43:55.565 --> 44:01.565
We've spent $33 billion in aid to Pakistan
since 2002 and this is how they repay us?

44:01.645 --> 44:02.645
Are you sure?

44:03.365 --> 44:04.805
The evidence would suggest--

44:04.885 --> 44:08.005
My government is in delicate negotiations
with Pakistan, Mr. Lavelle.

44:08.765 --> 44:11.805
Accusing them of hacking a UAV's
not going to get our man out alive.

44:11.885 --> 44:15.485
-So unless you have 100% proof...
-Prime Minister.

44:15.565 --> 44:17.245
I would not be here if we didn't.

44:25.485 --> 44:27.205
I want to talk to the drone pilot.

44:28.325 --> 44:29.565
She...

44:30.325 --> 44:31.525
She's gone missing, sir.

45:00.685 --> 45:03.645
There was a fraudulent transaction
on my stolen credit card.

45:03.725 --> 45:08.325
It was a $138 taxi ride
at 7:15 this morning.

45:08.645 --> 45:09.725
<i>Yes, Miss Dunkley.</i>

45:10.205 --> 45:12.645
So, I was wondering
if you could give me the drop-off address.

45:12.925 --> 45:16.485
<i>I'm sorry. There are privacy laws,</i>
<i>customer confidentiality.</i>

45:17.005 --> 45:20.005
Well, the customer was a thief,
who was assuming a stolen identity.

45:20.485 --> 45:23.645
I, uh... I work as a media adviser
in Karen Koutoufides' office,

45:23.725 --> 45:26.605
so I've got access to all the different
media outlets in the country.

45:26.965 --> 45:30.125
If you'd like your company to be known for
aiding and abetting criminal activity--

45:30.205 --> 45:31.565
<i>I'll get that address for you now.</i>

46:39.125 --> 46:42.165
Hacking our UAV is a serious act
of aggression, sir.

46:42.245 --> 46:44.765
And dropping bombs on them
from 20,000 feet isn't?

46:44.845 --> 46:48.085
Sir, our priority is to get
Markson out alive.

46:48.165 --> 46:49.885
Then we let the negotiations play out.

46:49.965 --> 46:52.565
You think, after this,
we can still trust Pakistan?

46:53.445 --> 46:56.925
If we reinstate Pale Horse,
we can monitor the Haqqani position.

46:57.685 --> 47:00.845
They'll lead us to Markson.
When they do, we go in.

47:00.925 --> 47:04.725
Trebuchet has upgraded all AOD
nine security measures, Prime Minister.

47:04.805 --> 47:07.045
Diplomatic options are a waste of time
with these people.

47:07.445 --> 47:10.405
I can have our troops in Afghanistan
alerted and stationed in Khost.

47:10.485 --> 47:13.645
Mr. Secretary, the Pakistani Ambassador
made it abundantly clear

47:13.725 --> 47:15.765
that would be seen
as a clarion call to war.

47:17.285 --> 47:20.725
Public support for this government
will not survive another military death.

47:20.805 --> 47:22.045
Ewan, you know that.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.445
I've left some milk
in the freezer. You can use that.

48:02.085 --> 48:04.125
It... It's in the ice trays.

48:04.685 --> 48:05.685
Yeah, okay.

48:08.285 --> 48:12.085
This better be important, Declan.
I am arse-deep right now.

48:12.365 --> 48:13.285
Karen.

48:21.765 --> 48:22.965
You're on the committee.

48:23.645 --> 48:25.125
Intelligence and Security?

48:25.205 --> 48:27.965
I want the evidence of the drone hack
reviewed as a matter of priority.

48:29.645 --> 48:31.445
Uh, why the about-face?

48:32.845 --> 48:34.485
Do you want to be on the committee or not?
I'm not your puppet, Ewan.

48:37.805 --> 48:39.725
Just do what you normally do, Karen.

48:39.805 --> 48:41.005
Ask the hard questions.

48:42.205 --> 48:43.605
Don't accept any bullshit.

49:48.805 --> 49:49.725
Hello!

50:01.165 --> 50:02.485
-Hello?

50:27.125 --> 50:29.845
Oh! Oh, my God!
