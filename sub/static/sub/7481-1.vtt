00:03.801 --> 00:05.168
Help me!

00:06.338 --> 00:07.705
His name is Marcel Janvier.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.807
He is holding Kelvin Atley.

00:09.809 --> 00:12.077
<i>We need to get Atley back</i>
<i>before he compromises</i>

00:12.079 --> 00:13.679
our man in Tehran.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.347
Code name: Cherokee.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.883
Do you play chess, Agent Callen?

00:17.885 --> 00:19.685
A little.
My move.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.423
He killed our people!

00:23.425 --> 00:24.657
Our people!

00:24.659 --> 00:25.591
Who's our mystery man?

00:25.593 --> 00:26.626
Naseem Vaziri.

00:26.628 --> 00:28.595
He's Iranian.

00:28.597 --> 00:30.498
What if Atley
already told Janvier

00:30.500 --> 00:32.033
the name of the asset in Iran?

00:32.034 --> 00:33.434
Cherokee gets compromised.

00:33.436 --> 00:35.937
<i>- And that's the price we pay.</i>
- No.

00:35.939 --> 00:37.438
No, this is not happening.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.690
Please have
all the transport prisoners...

01:01.659 --> 01:04.426
The transport van is here.

01:23.343 --> 01:25.543
Tough night?

01:25.545 --> 01:26.844
I've had worse.

01:26.846 --> 01:30.112
You owe Granger big-time
for getting you out of jail.

01:30.114 --> 01:33.515
Shooting's officially
under investigation.

01:33.517 --> 01:34.816
You're...

01:34.818 --> 01:37.419
Suspended. I know.
They told me.

01:37.421 --> 01:39.021
Hetty?

01:39.023 --> 01:40.789
Gone.

01:40.791 --> 01:43.459
You don't need to be here.

01:45.062 --> 01:47.797
We got company
across the street.

01:53.337 --> 01:54.904
Not <i>my</i> problem.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.873
Could be.

01:56.875 --> 01:59.175
It's not really helping my
case with you being here.

01:59.177 --> 02:00.477
Where should I be?

02:00.479 --> 02:01.811
I don't want to
talk about this.

02:01.813 --> 02:03.413
Was it worth it, G?

02:03.415 --> 02:04.581
Was it worth it?

02:04.583 --> 02:06.216
Get out of my face!

02:17.662 --> 02:19.830
Where to?
Venice.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.746
What are you doing
here, Vaziri?

02:34.748 --> 02:35.914
Excuse me?

02:36.682 --> 02:38.483
What do you want
from him?

02:38.485 --> 02:40.352
Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:40.354 --> 02:41.887
The hell you do.

02:45.859 --> 02:47.926
You stay away from him.

02:47.928 --> 02:48.727
You done?

03:26.301 --> 03:27.968
Easy! Move!

03:27.970 --> 03:30.437
Against the van!
Back off. Relax.

03:30.439 --> 03:31.472
Hands behind your back.

03:31.474 --> 03:33.140
How long is this video?

03:33.142 --> 03:35.175
Uh, 34 seconds.

03:35.177 --> 03:36.710
Blurred faces are a nice touch.

03:36.712 --> 03:38.411
It made the Net?

03:38.413 --> 03:40.180
'Fraid so.
I'm trying to stop

03:40.182 --> 03:41.814
the video
going viral,

03:41.816 --> 03:43.816
but as soon as I pull it,
another one pops up.

03:43.818 --> 03:45.317
What about
mainstream media?

03:45.319 --> 03:46.819
They've agreed
not to air the footage

03:46.821 --> 03:48.453
in the interest
of national security.

03:48.455 --> 03:50.355
Easy! Move!

03:50.357 --> 03:52.758
All right, I'm going to have
to write a kill program.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.826
Sorry, bad choice of words.

03:54.828 --> 03:57.162
Well, so it
didn't take long

03:57.164 --> 03:59.397
for the word to get out
that Hetty resigned.

03:59.399 --> 04:00.498
Half the LAPD

04:00.500 --> 04:01.833
already knows about it.

04:01.835 --> 04:03.001
Is Callen okay?

04:03.003 --> 04:04.402
Yeah.

04:04.404 --> 04:06.505
He's fine.

04:12.278 --> 04:13.711
With all due respect, sir,

04:13.713 --> 04:16.180
that's agency BS,
and we all know it.

04:16.183 --> 04:18.983
Cherokee was the CIA's
man, not ours.

04:20.286 --> 04:23.689
I understand but...

04:23.691 --> 04:25.557
If that's what
you need, sir.

04:26.392 --> 04:28.293
I will.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.930
Where's Atley?

04:31.932 --> 04:33.465
Boatshed.

04:33.467 --> 04:34.866
We haven't talked to him yet.

04:34.868 --> 04:38.170
The agency wants
their traitor back.

04:38.172 --> 04:40.606
They've started
a misinformation campaign

04:40.608 --> 04:43.975
to convince the Iranis that
Atley's information was wrong,

04:43.977 --> 04:46.311
that Cherokee isn't a spy.

04:46.313 --> 04:48.880
Tehran contacted
Vaziri overnight.

04:48.882 --> 04:50.849
They want independent
confirmation.

04:50.851 --> 04:52.185
Vaziri was waiting for Callen

04:52.187 --> 04:54.253
when he was released
this morning.

04:54.255 --> 04:57.425
Oh, and to top it off,
Director Vance wants to know

04:57.427 --> 05:00.328
why one of his agents shot
an unarmed man to death

05:00.330 --> 05:02.098
on national television.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.067
You tell him?
Yeah.

05:04.069 --> 05:07.003
The CIA's looking
for someone to blame, Sam.

05:07.005 --> 05:10.508
Suddenly this whole thing
is our fault.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.377
They want Callen's head
on a spear,

05:12.379 --> 05:15.580
and if we don't deliver...
SECNAV's gonna shut us down.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.584
I don't know how much longer
I can hold them off.

05:22.056 --> 05:25.793
You're a popular guy, Atley.

05:25.795 --> 05:27.829
A lot of people
want to talk to you.

05:27.831 --> 05:30.266
NSA, Pentagon, FBI,
State Department,

05:30.268 --> 05:32.368
not to mention the CIA.

05:32.370 --> 05:35.103
Those guys
really, really, <i>really</i>

05:35.105 --> 05:37.305
want to talk to you.

05:37.307 --> 05:39.074
So you tell us what you know,

05:39.076 --> 05:41.243
you don't have
to talk to them.

05:43.012 --> 05:45.180
I want indemnity
from prosecution.

05:45.182 --> 05:47.917
Wow. He doesn't get it, does he?
No. Oh,

05:47.919 --> 05:49.785
I don't think he does.
How long do you think

05:49.787 --> 05:51.687
you can hold your breath
underwater, Kelvin?

05:51.689 --> 05:54.223
You wouldn't do that.
No.

05:54.225 --> 05:56.558
<i>We</i> wouldn't do that,
but the CIA...

05:58.961 --> 06:01.997
I only gave the Iranians
Cherokee's name and that's all.

06:01.999 --> 06:03.598
Didn't give
them the file.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.133
What file?

06:05.135 --> 06:08.502
It's my insurance policy.
Yeah, I'd say this is

06:08.504 --> 06:12.072
a pretty good time to cash in
your insurance policy, Kelvin.

06:12.074 --> 06:13.740
I want indemnity.

06:13.742 --> 06:15.743
We tried.

06:15.745 --> 06:18.980
We definitely did try.
Send them in.

06:18.982 --> 06:20.348
Wait.

06:24.153 --> 06:26.954
I downloaded all the
encrypted communications

06:26.956 --> 06:29.290
between Cherokee
and Langley.

06:32.094 --> 06:36.730
It proves Cherokee
was spying for the CIA.

06:38.734 --> 06:40.635
It also lists the names
of every informant

06:40.637 --> 06:43.671
who's ever worked covertly
for the U.S. in Iran.

06:43.673 --> 06:45.707
What you might
call a...

06:45.709 --> 06:48.243
smoking gun for Tehran.

06:48.245 --> 06:50.879
International incident
for the U.S.

06:50.881 --> 06:52.347
Where's this file now?

06:53.282 --> 06:55.316
Safety-deposit box here in L.A.

06:55.318 --> 06:56.551
Who else knows about it?

06:56.553 --> 06:59.053
Janvier tried to make me
give him the key.

06:59.055 --> 07:01.022
Told him he wouldn't get it
till I got paid.

07:01.024 --> 07:03.124
I guess that didn't
really work out.

07:03.126 --> 07:05.627
Where's the key?

07:05.629 --> 07:07.663
Luggage locker, Union Station.

07:07.665 --> 07:09.097
Locker number?

07:09.099 --> 07:11.033
B-27.

07:11.035 --> 07:12.868
Thank you.

07:12.870 --> 07:15.470
And the Iranians.
What?

07:16.339 --> 07:18.440
They know about the file, too.

07:26.950 --> 07:30.619
You're not thinking of sailing
this anywhere, are you?

07:35.659 --> 07:38.328
The Atlantic.

07:38.330 --> 07:40.264
With them?

07:40.266 --> 07:41.632
No!

07:43.368 --> 07:45.303
Alone.

07:47.606 --> 07:50.942
I hope you haven't come to
talk me out of anything, Owen.

07:50.944 --> 07:52.777
Last time I saw this boat,

07:52.779 --> 07:56.013
she'd just been impounded
by the Brits at Gibraltar.

07:56.882 --> 07:58.449
It was a
misunderstanding

07:58.451 --> 08:00.818
between the harbormaster
and myself

08:00.820 --> 08:04.355
over a case of
Dom Pérignon.

08:05.424 --> 08:07.425
This is a yacht,
not a boat,

08:07.427 --> 08:09.394
and you haven't
answered my question.

08:09.396 --> 08:14.599
When's the last time I talked
you out of anything, Henrietta?

08:18.337 --> 08:20.471
Any news of Mr. Callen?

08:20.473 --> 08:22.773
He was released this morning.
I haven't seen him.

08:23.608 --> 08:25.610
You shouldn't have come.

08:25.612 --> 08:28.679
I thought you should know,
Iran is paranoid

08:28.681 --> 08:31.749
that they've been
set up by the CIA.

08:31.751 --> 08:36.053
Something Langley's actively
encouraging them to believe.

08:36.054 --> 08:38.455
Tehran's asked
Vaziri to confirm

08:38.457 --> 08:41.058
that Cherokee really
is a CIA spy.

08:41.059 --> 08:43.059
So...

08:43.062 --> 08:45.562
you need to be
careful, Henrietta.

08:45.564 --> 08:48.498
Screw Washington, Tehran,

08:48.500 --> 08:51.634
the whole spy game.

08:51.636 --> 08:53.803
I'm not going to
defend the agency

08:53.805 --> 08:55.571
or anybody else,
for that matter.

08:55.573 --> 08:59.041
They're all responsible
for making this mess.

08:59.043 --> 09:03.379
And if you've got that
letter in your jacket,

09:03.381 --> 09:05.914
you hang on to it, Owen.

09:05.916 --> 09:07.316
Henrietta...

09:07.318 --> 09:11.119
Get the hell off my yacht.

09:15.892 --> 09:17.459
Go on!

10:22.724 --> 10:24.826
Some days we appreciate
our freedom more than others,

10:24.828 --> 10:27.329
wouldn't you agree?

10:28.899 --> 10:31.600
Forgive me.
My name is...

10:31.602 --> 10:32.868
Naseem Vaziri.

10:32.870 --> 10:34.036
I know who you are.

10:34.038 --> 10:37.006
Then you know we have
a mutual acquaintance.

10:37.008 --> 10:38.474
Or we did.

10:38.476 --> 10:40.410
Until you killed him.

10:43.113 --> 10:44.914
I'm intrigued,
Agent Callen.

10:44.916 --> 10:47.717
Why you would do
such a thing?

10:48.552 --> 10:51.254
Janvier must have found
your weakness.

10:51.256 --> 10:53.757
Got nothing to say to you.

10:53.759 --> 10:55.458
Just listen, then.

10:57.961 --> 11:01.297
Janvier and I were engaged
in a business transaction.

11:01.299 --> 11:03.633
He was going to
give me a file.

11:03.635 --> 11:05.401
I'm not Atley.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.170
Atley had a price.

11:07.172 --> 11:10.874
Janvier had a price.

11:10.876 --> 11:11.975
We all have a price.

11:11.977 --> 11:14.178
I just need to find
out what's yours.

11:25.690 --> 11:28.591
Atley's bank of choice.

11:28.593 --> 11:32.162
We got this from the bank's
exterior security cameras.

11:32.164 --> 11:35.932
This car is registered to
one of Vaziri's companies.

11:35.934 --> 11:38.635
Ah, a little Iranian reception
party for anybody that comes

11:38.637 --> 11:41.237
to collect Atley's file
from the safety-deposit box.

11:41.239 --> 11:44.107
Could've paid one of the bank
employees to, uh, tip them off.

11:44.109 --> 11:46.977
We need to secure that file
before the Iranians or else.

11:46.979 --> 11:48.612
Or else what?

11:50.715 --> 11:52.916
Work up a plan.
Keep me updated.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.621
Or else what?

11:56.623 --> 12:00.424
Or else we'll all gonna be
looking for another job.

12:10.035 --> 12:12.537
Salaam, Henrietta.

12:23.583 --> 12:25.850
Death can have
its advantages.

12:25.852 --> 12:30.522
I remember the last time
I saw you in Tehran,

12:30.524 --> 12:33.959
the revolutionary students were
dragging you off to prison.

12:33.961 --> 12:37.929
To teach me
the error of my ways.

12:39.699 --> 12:41.366
I was a good student.

12:41.368 --> 12:43.635
I denounced the Shah
and embraced the revolution.

12:43.637 --> 12:46.038
Never too late
to change sides.

12:46.040 --> 12:50.174
In our line of work,
it's always an option.

12:50.176 --> 12:52.076
And you.

12:52.078 --> 12:54.212
All these rumors.

12:54.214 --> 12:57.215
Such a shame they
cast you aside like this.

12:57.217 --> 13:00.084
There are too many
bureaucrats, Hosein.

13:00.086 --> 13:01.653
The game has changed.

13:01.655 --> 13:05.323
And it seems as if we're all
working for the CIA these days.

13:05.325 --> 13:07.592
Surely not you, Henrietta?

13:07.594 --> 13:10.329
Well, I-I never was one to

13:10.331 --> 13:12.998
do what was expected of me.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.803
This latest CIA operation...

13:16.805 --> 13:21.175
The one man who knows the
truth about this mess has been

13:21.177 --> 13:24.244
thrown out of NCIS on his ass

13:24.246 --> 13:26.380
and will probably wind up

13:26.382 --> 13:29.517
in prison for killing
a man who deserved it.

13:29.519 --> 13:31.052
Agent Callen.

13:33.422 --> 13:35.323
I've said too much.

13:37.092 --> 13:39.827
Perhaps we could speak
some more over tea?

13:39.829 --> 13:42.731
Perhaps not.

13:42.733 --> 13:45.433
I have a car.

13:45.435 --> 13:48.503
So have I.

13:50.773 --> 13:52.941
Some other time...

13:52.943 --> 13:54.342
Henrietta.

14:25.776 --> 14:29.912
You can come out now,
Mr. Hanna.

14:34.084 --> 14:38.254
I never did trust
that bastard.

14:40.089 --> 14:44.560
They sent someone
from your past.

14:44.562 --> 14:49.532
I should have killed him back
then when I had the chance.

14:54.938 --> 14:58.708
I'm perfectly capable of looking
after myself, Mr. Hanna.

14:58.710 --> 15:00.610
I was just passing.

15:02.613 --> 15:05.415
Langley's breathing
down Granger's neck.

15:05.417 --> 15:06.916
Looking for someone
to blame.

15:06.918 --> 15:10.186
Not unexpected.

15:10.188 --> 15:13.056
It gets worse.

15:13.058 --> 15:15.291
Atley's admitted he has a file
that contains the names

15:15.293 --> 15:17.393
of Cherokee's informants
in Tehran.

15:17.395 --> 15:19.662
If we don't
retrieve that file,

15:19.664 --> 15:22.832
SECNAV's closing down the unit.

15:24.301 --> 15:25.535
How's Mr. Callen?

15:25.537 --> 15:28.003
He says he's fine.

15:28.005 --> 15:30.840
But you and I know otherwise.

15:33.911 --> 15:36.679
One day it catches
up with all of us.

15:36.681 --> 15:40.517
If you're lucky,

15:40.519 --> 15:44.454
someone else dies
and you get to walk away.

15:46.523 --> 15:50.427
Go home, Sam.

15:50.429 --> 15:53.463
Mr. Callen and I
are on our own.

16:00.571 --> 16:02.072
And if I need to find you?

16:02.074 --> 16:04.240
Nearest bar.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.154
Scotch on the rocks.
You got it.

16:32.203 --> 16:34.104
Were you followed?

16:35.339 --> 16:37.107
No, but you were.

16:37.109 --> 16:39.509
Vaziri and another guy.

16:39.511 --> 16:41.478
Bald, gray beard,
tan jacket.

16:44.515 --> 16:47.984
His name's Hosein Khadem.

16:47.986 --> 16:49.786
He's trying
to intimidate me.

16:49.788 --> 16:51.155
Is it working?

16:51.157 --> 16:52.823
Just ignore them.

16:54.293 --> 16:57.094
How's retirement?

16:57.096 --> 16:59.130
I could die of boredom...

17:00.099 --> 17:03.000
...if someone doesn't
shoot me first.

17:08.473 --> 17:11.675
How was your day,
Mr. Callen?

17:16.482 --> 17:18.316
I went for a swim.

17:18.318 --> 17:20.852
When I got out, Vaziri
was holding my towel.

17:22.588 --> 17:26.491
Tehran's paranoid that
they caught the wrong spy.

17:26.492 --> 17:28.760
Vaziri's looking to confirm

17:28.762 --> 17:31.163
that Atley's given them
the right name.

17:31.165 --> 17:34.133
Evidently, Atley has a file

17:34.135 --> 17:36.135
with the names
of other dissidents.

17:36.137 --> 17:37.737
Vaziri paid you a
call today, too?

17:37.739 --> 17:40.439
No, not Vaziri.

17:40.441 --> 17:41.874
Khadem.

17:44.978 --> 17:47.179
How do you know this guy?

17:47.181 --> 17:49.815
Khadem was Savak,

17:49.817 --> 17:52.852
Iranian Secret Police
under the Shah.

17:52.854 --> 17:57.256
When Khomeini came to power,
he changed sides.

17:57.258 --> 18:01.928
He went from being my ally
to my enemy overnight.

18:01.930 --> 18:05.764
Betrayed dozens of good men,
their families.

18:05.766 --> 18:08.167
Many of them my friends.

18:08.169 --> 18:12.672
Khadem's my Janvier.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.207
You'd shoot him in cold blood?

18:15.209 --> 18:18.611
That would be murder,
Mr. Callen.

18:20.380 --> 18:22.782
So, you're just going to wait
for him to make the first move?

18:27.019 --> 18:29.488
Do I have a choice?

18:31.124 --> 18:32.958
No.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.327
But I do.

18:34.329 --> 18:36.996
Might as well add treason
to my arrest warrant.

18:44.538 --> 18:45.871
Mr. Callen.

18:45.873 --> 18:48.474
You want my price?
It's her.

18:50.344 --> 18:52.411
You keep him away from her,
you'll get what you want.

18:52.413 --> 18:53.779
I want Atley's file.

18:53.781 --> 18:56.649
You know I can't deliver that.

18:56.651 --> 18:58.517
Then confirm the name
of your spy in Tehran.

19:07.762 --> 19:08.929
Code name: Cherokee.

19:08.931 --> 19:12.966
You know him
as General Sanjar Esfahani.

19:15.437 --> 19:18.672
You just got yourself
a CIA spy.

19:23.378 --> 19:25.179
You stay away from her.

19:25.181 --> 19:27.081
Of course.

20:01.837 --> 20:03.304
Everybody, listen up.

20:03.306 --> 20:06.174
NSA intercepted
a phone call

20:06.176 --> 20:08.611
between Vaziri and
Tehran overnight.

20:08.613 --> 20:11.681
Vaziri told Tehran
that an NCIS agent

20:11.683 --> 20:13.315
confirmed Cherokee's identity.

20:13.317 --> 20:17.152
The CIA is demanding
Callen's immediate arrest.

20:17.154 --> 20:18.253
Are we going to comply?

20:18.255 --> 20:19.822
Since when do we work
for the CIA?

20:19.824 --> 20:20.923
No way we're
doing this.

20:20.925 --> 20:22.324
Look, we don't have a say
in this.

20:22.326 --> 20:24.659
The call came directly
from SECNAV

20:24.661 --> 20:27.195
You want to help Callen,
you want to help us,

20:27.197 --> 20:28.296
get Atley's file,

20:28.298 --> 20:30.331
make sure it gets
into the right hands.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.534
We're gonna have
one shot at this.

20:32.536 --> 20:33.768
Let's make it count.

20:40.508 --> 20:42.709
Hey, Sam.

20:44.178 --> 20:45.812
You think this
plan's gonna work?

20:47.582 --> 20:49.216
It's gotta work.

20:49.218 --> 20:51.819
Yeah.

21:00.329 --> 21:01.629
Nell, talk to legal.

21:01.631 --> 21:04.499
We're going to need an arrest
warrant for Agent Callen.

21:04.501 --> 21:06.901
So, what are the
charges exactly,

21:06.903 --> 21:08.870
treason or murder?

21:08.872 --> 21:10.805
Both.

21:12.007 --> 21:13.875
Right.

21:21.317 --> 21:23.251
Okay, we've got a
visual and comms.

21:23.253 --> 21:25.987
Just arriving at the bank.

21:25.989 --> 21:27.922
Kensi and Deeks
are out of the car, Eric.

21:27.924 --> 21:31.459
Looks like our Iranian friends
are still here.

21:31.461 --> 21:34.929
SUV on the right.

21:34.931 --> 21:36.429
This could
get interesting.

21:36.431 --> 21:37.764
I like interesting.

21:37.766 --> 21:40.166
If it's gonna happen,
it'll be when you come out.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.501
Be ready.

21:41.503 --> 21:44.270
You got everything?

21:44.272 --> 21:45.972
Yes, Mom.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.342
Status please, Eric.

21:49.344 --> 21:51.344
They've collected
the safety-deposit box key

21:51.346 --> 21:52.378
from the luggage locker.

21:52.380 --> 21:54.013
Just arrived at the bank.

21:54.015 --> 21:55.481
The Iranians?

21:55.483 --> 21:56.715
Front and center.

21:56.717 --> 21:58.017
I counted two in the SUV.

21:58.019 --> 21:59.385
Could be more.

21:59.387 --> 22:01.421
You think we're
on their radar?

22:01.423 --> 22:03.222
In this suit,
are you kidding me?

22:03.224 --> 22:04.557
Probably haven't taken
their eyes off me

22:04.559 --> 22:07.560
since I got out
of the car.

22:07.562 --> 22:10.697
Or it could be...
yeah, it's probably you.

22:10.699 --> 22:12.465
I'm just saying
that skirt is working.

22:12.467 --> 22:14.634
They've entered the bank.

22:14.636 --> 22:16.069
I got 'em, Sam.

22:22.277 --> 22:23.277
Morning.

22:23.279 --> 22:24.211
Good morning.

22:24.213 --> 22:26.146
Welcome to
Certified National.

22:26.148 --> 22:27.281
How can we be
of service today?

22:27.283 --> 22:28.783
I need access a
safety-deposit box.

22:28.785 --> 22:30.184
Certainly. Name?

22:30.186 --> 22:31.885
Peters.

22:31.887 --> 22:33.988
And away we go.

22:33.990 --> 22:35.423
First name?

22:35.425 --> 22:36.891
Scott.

22:36.893 --> 22:38.259
This is your
safety-deposit box

22:38.261 --> 22:40.128
or...
My husband's.

22:40.130 --> 22:42.598
But you have his signed
authorization to access the box?

22:42.600 --> 22:45.935
I'm his wife.

22:45.937 --> 22:49.172
I'm sorry, but you either
need to be designated

22:49.174 --> 22:50.874
or have a signed authorization.

22:50.876 --> 22:54.177
Okay, listen, honey,
he's my husband, okay?

22:54.179 --> 22:56.380
What's his is mine,
what's mine, oh,

22:56.382 --> 22:57.949
he's welcome to,
because I don't have

22:57.951 --> 22:59.484
a damn safety-deposit
box, do I?

22:59.486 --> 23:01.352
- Morning.
- Uh...

23:01.354 --> 23:02.854
I am, uh, Kelvin Atley.

23:02.856 --> 23:05.690
I need to access my
safety-deposit box, please.

23:05.692 --> 23:07.826
Of course, Mr. Atley.

23:07.828 --> 23:09.694
Mrs. Peters, there's no need
to raise your voice.

23:09.696 --> 23:11.329
I'm sure if you
just ask your husband...

23:11.331 --> 23:14.099
You want me to talk
to my cheating, lying,

23:14.101 --> 23:15.833
good-for-nothing, two-faced

23:15.835 --> 23:17.101
cheap husband?

23:17.103 --> 23:18.203
This is what you want?

23:18.205 --> 23:19.504
Start World War III?
I'm sorry.

23:19.506 --> 23:21.472
I didn't think so.
You're sorry.

23:21.474 --> 23:23.074
Okay, okay, you know what?

23:23.076 --> 23:24.642
If I can't have
access to that box,

23:24.644 --> 23:26.277
you are going to
open it and you're

23:26.279 --> 23:28.212
gonna tell me how much money
he's got stashed in there.

23:28.214 --> 23:29.880
That's what you're
gonna do, honey.

23:29.882 --> 23:31.748
Sign right here.
Of course.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.284
Even if I was authorized to,
which I'm not,

23:34.286 --> 23:37.754
it's a two key system and
I'd need your husband's key.

23:39.156 --> 23:40.590
You want a key?

23:40.592 --> 23:42.892
You want a key?
I'll give you a damn key.

23:42.894 --> 23:45.194
I just need to check
your ID on file.

23:45.196 --> 23:47.363
If we could do this
quickly, I'm actually

23:47.365 --> 23:48.698
in a little bit of a hurry.

23:48.700 --> 23:51.601
There you go. There you go.
Oh.

23:51.603 --> 23:53.636
Oh, freaking ridiculous.

23:53.638 --> 23:56.439
I don't have a key.
I don't have a key.

23:56.441 --> 23:58.741
You know why? Because he's
freaking stingy, that's why.

24:00.878 --> 24:03.746
Try not to get too upset here.
So, we're good then?

24:03.748 --> 24:04.947
That stupid moron.
Hmm?

24:04.949 --> 24:06.114
Sir, good to go?

24:06.116 --> 24:08.583
Yeah, um, just come
with me this way.

24:08.585 --> 24:09.718
See, I have no key.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.353
I have no key.
Do you know why?

24:11.355 --> 24:13.088
Because that floozy
has that key.

24:13.090 --> 24:16.425
That blonde floozy with
highlights and short hair...

24:16.427 --> 24:17.359
And we're in.

24:17.361 --> 24:18.627
That's right.

24:30.474 --> 24:31.974
Take all the time you need.

24:31.976 --> 24:33.109
Thank you, sir.

24:45.823 --> 24:47.690
I got a USB.

24:47.692 --> 24:49.125
This must be the file.
We good?

24:49.127 --> 24:51.060
Clear, you're good to go.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.568
This is how you treat
your customers?

24:58.570 --> 25:00.570
This is how you treat
your customers?

25:00.572 --> 25:01.704
Are you
enjoying yourself?

25:01.706 --> 25:03.706
Are you enjoying
this? Are you?

25:03.708 --> 25:05.541
Really?
On the way out right now.

25:11.048 --> 25:12.916
All right.

25:12.918 --> 25:15.752
Iranians are on the move.

25:15.754 --> 25:17.587
Someone in the bank must
have tipped them off.

25:17.589 --> 25:19.222
Don't rush.

25:19.224 --> 25:21.758
Let 'em come.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.160
Okay, guys, they've got backup.

25:26.498 --> 25:27.464
Move to plan B.

25:27.466 --> 25:28.765
I hate plan B.

25:29.968 --> 25:32.136
Go!

25:32.138 --> 25:33.504
Follow them!

26:27.226 --> 26:28.526
Sam!

26:28.528 --> 26:31.129
Sam, you got to get down here.

26:56.356 --> 26:58.222
Let's go, let's go!

26:58.224 --> 26:59.557
Let's go!

27:01.294 --> 27:03.194
Leave it, leave it!

27:36.984 --> 27:39.486
Yeah, no,
I completely understand.

27:39.488 --> 27:41.488
I'm just saying
don't-don't try too hard.

27:41.490 --> 27:43.490
Yeah, exactly.

27:43.492 --> 27:45.825
Okay, yeah, thanks, Mikey.

27:45.827 --> 27:47.694
Yup, you, too.

27:47.696 --> 27:50.263
Well, Callen's arrest warrant
just went out.

27:50.265 --> 27:51.498
Does anyone know
where he is?

27:51.500 --> 27:52.866
Good luck trying to find him.

27:52.868 --> 27:54.901
Eric have any luck
tracing that car?

27:54.903 --> 27:56.837
All the way to Santa Monica,
then they lost it.

27:56.839 --> 27:58.238
They're doing
a kaleidoscope search.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.507
Okay, all right.
Well, we know we got two, right?

28:00.509 --> 28:01.909
And I think I winged one,

28:01.911 --> 28:03.978
so why doesn't Nell just
check the local ERs?

28:03.980 --> 28:06.057
It's out of our hands;
we gave it our best shot.

28:06.082 --> 28:07.115
Did we?

28:07.116 --> 28:09.951
Ops. Now.

28:13.922 --> 28:17.425
Something's going down
in Tehran.

28:17.427 --> 28:20.261
NSA picked up a major spike
in telecommunications traffic.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.663
Most of it's
internal--

28:21.665 --> 28:23.732
intelligence agencies,
key government ministers,

28:23.734 --> 28:25.100
the military.

28:25.102 --> 28:26.268
NSA intercepted

28:26.270 --> 28:29.271
a burst transmission
from Vaziri to Tehran

28:29.273 --> 28:31.773
an hour after they
received Atley's USB.

28:31.775 --> 28:33.141
15 minutes later,
they're in meltdown.

28:33.143 --> 28:35.310
Guess they didn't like
what was in the file.

28:35.312 --> 28:37.379
And Vaziri just received
an encrypted e-mail

28:37.381 --> 28:38.780
from Tehran 30 minutes ago.

28:38.782 --> 28:40.982
NSA's still
decrypting it.

28:40.984 --> 28:42.350
Okay, we need to see that, Eric.

28:42.352 --> 28:44.386
Well, that would require us
looking over their shoulder

28:44.388 --> 28:46.678
while they decrypt it,
which isn't the normal

28:46.703 --> 28:47.724
level of access they allow.

28:47.725 --> 28:50.126
Hell with what they allow;
just do it.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.028
Just doing it.

28:53.932 --> 28:57.367
Okay, hacking the NSA.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.703
And...

28:59.705 --> 29:01.805
we're in.

29:01.807 --> 29:03.941
Does anyone speak Farsi?

29:03.943 --> 29:06.210
Hetty does.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.180
Good point.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.748
It was a long time ago.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.717
I'm rusty.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.820
Something about...

29:16.822 --> 29:19.790
conflicting information...

29:20.625 --> 29:23.860
Use all necessary measures.

29:28.133 --> 29:31.035
Reconfirming conflicting
information that was given to them.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.937
Given to them by Atley?

29:36.442 --> 29:38.877
Operative.

29:38.879 --> 29:40.545
Callen.

29:40.547 --> 29:42.747
Vaziri's going
back to Callen

29:42.749 --> 29:44.816
to confirm what
he told them.

29:44.818 --> 29:47.353
And use all
necessary measures.

29:47.355 --> 29:48.921
Wait.

29:48.923 --> 29:51.057
That's an order, Agent Hanna.

29:51.059 --> 29:53.525
Eric.

29:53.527 --> 29:55.394
Calling Agent Callen.

29:58.497 --> 29:59.564
No answer.

29:59.566 --> 30:01.399
Phone turned off?

30:05.371 --> 30:06.904
Dead.

30:09.707 --> 30:13.043
Vaziri got the message
30 minutes ago, Sam.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.778
It's too late.

30:31.162 --> 30:34.965
Tell me the identity
of the CIA spy in Tehran.

30:36.567 --> 30:38.401
Cherokee.

30:38.403 --> 30:39.770
And Cherokee's real name?

30:39.772 --> 30:43.606
I told you last night
in the bar.

30:49.046 --> 30:51.214
Tell me again.

30:54.719 --> 30:56.286
General...

30:56.288 --> 30:58.288
Sanjar Esfahani.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.291
General Esfahani denies it.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.059
Well, wouldn't you?

31:09.199 --> 31:11.468
Tell me what
you know about Atley.

31:12.336 --> 31:15.038
Atley...

31:15.040 --> 31:18.742
was an NSA analyst.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.810
He turned traitor.

31:20.812 --> 31:25.172
He knew the CIA
had a spy in Tehran

31:25.197 --> 31:26.618
code-named Cherokee.

31:26.619 --> 31:29.019
He offered the information
to Janvier.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.021
Janvier sold
the information to you.

31:31.023 --> 31:34.357
You asked for confirmation;
I gave you confirmation.

31:34.359 --> 31:37.427
General Sanjar
Esfahani

31:37.429 --> 31:39.863
<i>is</i> Cherokee.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.564
You're not
telling me the truth.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.133
There's no other truth.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.171
Tehran believes otherwise.

31:48.173 --> 31:49.773
They have Atley's file.

31:49.775 --> 31:53.009
There are, shall we say,
discrepancies.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.318
You there?

32:02.186 --> 32:05.222
Start the camera.

32:07.225 --> 32:10.427
Yesterday... you asked me

32:10.429 --> 32:13.530
for her life.

32:13.532 --> 32:16.266
Today I'm going to
give it to you....

32:16.268 --> 32:19.102
for the truth.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.738
I gave you the truth--
there's no mistake.

32:21.740 --> 32:25.375
I gave you the name;
you gave them their spy.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.847
Kill her.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.450
Wait!

32:41.649 --> 32:43.417
Wait! Tell him to wait!

32:43.419 --> 32:46.286
The truth.
Tell him to wait! Call him off!

32:46.288 --> 32:48.956
Call him off!

32:48.958 --> 32:51.057
Stand down, Khadem.

32:51.059 --> 32:53.793
Khadem, can you hear me?

32:55.462 --> 32:57.029
Khadem, can you hear me?!

32:57.031 --> 32:58.931
I said, stand down, Khadem.

32:58.933 --> 33:01.300
Can you hear me?!

33:02.369 --> 33:04.836
I hear you, Naseem.

33:07.139 --> 33:11.576
If I don't like your version
of the truth, she dies.

33:14.880 --> 33:18.116
It's a lie.

33:18.118 --> 33:20.552
What's a lie?
Everything.

33:21.554 --> 33:23.755
Cherokee.

33:24.557 --> 33:27.392
There was no spy in Tehran.

33:27.394 --> 33:29.660
This whole operation
was put together

33:29.662 --> 33:32.163
by the CIA to
convince you there was.

33:33.498 --> 33:35.433
Why?

33:35.435 --> 33:36.800
To eliminate
the one man

33:36.802 --> 33:40.938
the CIA fears in Tehran
more than anyone.

33:40.940 --> 33:43.274
Sanjar Esfahani.

33:43.276 --> 33:44.475
Why would they fear him?

33:44.477 --> 33:46.343
Because he can't be bought.

33:46.345 --> 33:49.013
He's an extremist who
is loyal to the clergy

33:49.015 --> 33:50.982
and the military.

33:50.984 --> 33:53.952
But they knew that
if you thought he was a spy,

33:53.954 --> 33:56.588
you'd have him arrested.

33:56.590 --> 33:58.690
You'd have him executed
for treason.

33:58.692 --> 34:01.493
But they knew they had
to convince you first.

34:01.495 --> 34:03.228
Atley?

34:03.230 --> 34:06.431
Gave Esfahani's
name to Janvier.

34:06.433 --> 34:09.768
They figured if you had
to pay more for the information,

34:09.770 --> 34:11.570
you'd be more willing
to believe it.

34:14.174 --> 34:15.475
Lies!

34:15.476 --> 34:18.777
I saw you shoot Janvier.

34:18.780 --> 34:22.282
An arrest warrant has been
issued for you for his murder!

34:27.321 --> 34:29.723
There is someone

34:29.725 --> 34:31.792
that can prove
that everything I'm saying

34:31.793 --> 34:33.460
is the truth.

34:33.462 --> 34:35.228
Who?

34:40.034 --> 34:42.569
Who?!

34:42.571 --> 34:44.038
Janvier.

34:48.909 --> 34:51.645
It's time to go.

34:53.514 --> 34:56.050
Go where?

34:56.052 --> 34:57.585
For a ride.

34:57.587 --> 35:00.822
No bulletproof vest this time?

35:01.690 --> 35:03.858
Put this on.

35:04.659 --> 35:06.460
Why?

35:06.462 --> 35:09.330
When you're in our protection,
you wear a vest.

35:09.332 --> 35:11.232
No exceptions.

35:14.969 --> 35:16.103
Okay.

35:16.105 --> 35:18.272
No vest.

35:21.143 --> 35:23.745
We're not planning
to shoot you this time.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.314
Why would you stage
Janvier's murder?

35:26.316 --> 35:29.751
So you'd believe
I had nothing to lose.

35:29.753 --> 35:33.856
A disgraced agent...
under investigation.

35:33.858 --> 35:37.292
Someone you could get to.

35:37.294 --> 35:40.295
Someone you could buy off to
confirm Atley's information.

35:46.837 --> 35:49.772
My leg still hurts.

35:56.479 --> 35:58.180
Good.

36:02.252 --> 36:05.287
Where are you taking me?

36:05.289 --> 36:06.921
Road trip.

36:10.393 --> 36:12.793
Tehran's going to want someone

36:12.795 --> 36:14.762
to pay for this.

36:14.764 --> 36:16.463
Better it not be you.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.699
But you got to
give them something.

36:20.368 --> 36:22.969
The $50 million they paid
for the information...

36:22.971 --> 36:25.138
and the man they gave it to.

36:25.140 --> 36:27.307
Go on.

36:27.309 --> 36:31.011
You stay away
from Henrietta Lange,

36:31.013 --> 36:33.613
call off Khadem.

36:33.615 --> 36:36.016
And?

36:36.018 --> 36:38.718
A trade.

36:41.456 --> 36:44.391
Me for Janvier.

37:14.758 --> 37:16.792
What is this?

37:16.794 --> 37:18.694
You're no longer our problem.

37:18.696 --> 37:20.897
We're letting you go.

37:43.689 --> 37:46.591
I hear the weather's great
in Tehran this time of year.

37:57.737 --> 38:00.006
Checkmate.

38:29.703 --> 38:31.970
♪ ♪

39:00.601 --> 39:03.569
I hope you haven't moved
my things, Owen.

39:03.571 --> 39:06.205
I'm not that crazy.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.054
You know, you don't have
to keep changing the dates.

39:22.056 --> 39:24.056
You could just print
up a new one each time.

39:26.427 --> 39:28.828
Just a thought.

39:53.421 --> 39:56.723
Shall we have
an operational debrief?

39:56.725 --> 39:58.926
Sure.

40:00.795 --> 40:02.730
Cherokee's been released.

40:02.732 --> 40:04.965
He got a promotion
for his troubles.

40:04.967 --> 40:08.836
He's been put in charge
of counterintelligence.

40:08.838 --> 40:11.506
His specific brief is
to protect the Tehran government

40:11.508 --> 40:13.508
from foreign spies.

40:13.510 --> 40:14.909
And the agency?

40:14.911 --> 40:17.779
Well, they're relieved
they still have a man in Tehran.

40:17.781 --> 40:20.449
Of course,
they want a full report.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.017
They want to know exactly when

40:22.019 --> 40:23.853
we worked up
this audacious plan,

40:23.855 --> 40:26.522
and why we didn't include them
in it.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.858
We are out of time,
Agent Callen!

40:28.860 --> 40:32.194
And we don't have another plan!

40:34.497 --> 40:36.498
I'm sorry, Mr. Callen.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.434
I'm sorry.

40:40.570 --> 40:43.204
No.

40:43.206 --> 40:45.973
There's got to be something
we can do.

40:50.178 --> 40:52.947
Maybe there is.

40:54.783 --> 40:56.851
Do you want to share, Henrietta?

40:56.853 --> 40:58.886
To make people believe it,

40:58.888 --> 41:02.123
I think I'm going
to have to resign.

41:03.593 --> 41:05.527
And you, Mr. Callen,

41:05.529 --> 41:09.031
are going to have
to shoot Janvier.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.668
Maybe you could tell them

41:12.670 --> 41:15.638
we just worked it out
over a cup of tea.

41:17.074 --> 41:21.444
What did you replace
Atley's file with?

41:23.413 --> 41:26.749
<i>Deeks switched the USBs</i>
<i>at the bank,</i>

41:26.751 --> 41:30.386
but Eric had changed one file,
<i>Operation Cherokee.</i>

41:30.388 --> 41:33.822
<i>A two-page proposal</i>
<i>from the CIA</i>

41:33.824 --> 41:35.591
outlining how
to fool foreign governments

41:35.593 --> 41:38.327
into arresting
the wrong people for spying.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.664
Then it was just a matter
of making sure it fell

41:41.666 --> 41:43.533
into Iranian hands.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.468
Leave it! Leave it!

41:45.470 --> 41:48.838
We were lucky, Henrietta.

41:51.075 --> 41:54.477
Fortune favors the brave, Owen.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.180
Hey, Callen.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.048
Morning, G.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.216
Hey, Pete,
not so tight

42:00.218 --> 42:01.450
on the cuffs
next time, all right?

42:01.452 --> 42:02.551
Put the gun down!

42:02.553 --> 42:03.753
Lower your weapon!

42:04.688 --> 42:06.121
You owe us a drink.

42:06.123 --> 42:07.489
Done.

42:12.106 --> 42:16.442
What's Mr. Callen's
undercover status?

42:16.444 --> 42:18.444
He's operational.

42:18.446 --> 42:20.780
Eric minimized his exposure.

42:20.782 --> 42:22.182
And Vaziri?

42:22.184 --> 42:25.185
When the dust settles,
we'll take him down.

42:25.187 --> 42:27.387
There's no hurry.

42:28.823 --> 42:30.991
But there is one thing.

42:33.061 --> 42:36.763
A body washed up
at the Marina this morning.

42:38.232 --> 42:40.233
Hosein Khadem?

42:40.235 --> 42:42.235
He'd been shot.

42:42.237 --> 42:44.771
I guess

42:44.773 --> 42:47.407
he and Vaziri had a falling out.

42:51.069 --> 42:55.272
Would you like to join me
for a cup of tea, Owen?

42:55.274 --> 42:58.474
Or would you prefer something
a little stronger?
