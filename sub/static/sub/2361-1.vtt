01:06.984 --> 01:08.614
Last tour of the day.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.696
I wonder why nobody wants them.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.485
Bull's-eye.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.617
Hi, super old guy!

01:20.664 --> 01:22.544
A museum? Again?

01:24.209 --> 01:25.709
I hate stuff.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.342
- Oh, boy.
- It's okay, Thomas.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.919
I'll take them.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.134
Are you sure?

01:32.176 --> 01:34.336
I think these are the "detention" kids.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.394
Don't you worry. I can handle them.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.852
You go take your break.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.562
Thanks.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.024
Follow me, kids.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.396
Yo, lady! The museum door is that way.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.856
Yes, it is,
but you aren't like the other kids.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.317
Oh, no, no, no.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.116
You need to see something special.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.367
Right through that door.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.043
You're seeing things, lady.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.383
Am I?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.749
Or are you not seeing things?

02:09.795 --> 02:11.336
Whoa.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.051
Come on.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.888
Now, today is November 2nd.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.516
Does anyone here
know why that date is important?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.363
Taco Tuesday!

02:28.398 --> 02:29.228
No.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.784
"Gorge yourself on Halloween candy" day?

02:33.278 --> 02:36.358
- Nope. Today is the day of the dead.
- Wait.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.656
Is that national zombie day
or something?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.367
You can't go this way!

02:42.412 --> 02:44.612
You will get us both in trouble.
Ancient rules of the...

02:45.457 --> 02:48.457
Museum administration.

02:48.502 --> 02:52.092
Well, I suppose I could turn
a blind eye, my...

02:52.923 --> 02:54.093
Dear.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.005
Behold, children, the glorious beauty...

03:01.431 --> 03:03.021
Of Mexico!

03:11.608 --> 03:12.608
Whoa!

03:13.151 --> 03:16.071
This place is loco.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.033
So many skulls!

03:19.366 --> 03:20.946
At least that part isn't lame.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.461
Whoa!

03:26.164 --> 03:27.424
What is this book?

03:27.457 --> 03:30.087
That is the book of life.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.207
All the world is made of stories...

03:32.254 --> 03:36.094
And all of those stories are right here.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.643
This book holds many truths.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.643
Some are actually true.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.100
"The battle of cinco de Mayo"?

03:45.142 --> 03:48.232
Mayo! I love Mayo.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.560
And some, not so much.

03:50.606 --> 03:54.476
El chupacabras,
the legendary goat sucker?

03:54.526 --> 03:56.436
I have to get one.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.492
Now, although you may doubt
some of these stories...

03:59.531 --> 04:01.781
There is one thing
that we know for certain.

04:01.825 --> 04:05.285
Mexico is the center of the universe.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.829
And long ago, in the center of Mexico...

04:07.873 --> 04:11.003
Was the quaint little town of San angel.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.803
Churros! Churros!

04:14.713 --> 04:16.463
Frosted churros!

04:16.714 --> 04:20.135
Now, naturally, since San angel
was the center of the universe...

04:20.177 --> 04:21.887
Directly below it lay...

04:22.346 --> 04:24.306
The land of the remembered.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.928
A festive and magical place
for those who live on...

04:27.976 --> 04:29.476
In the memories of their loved ones.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.520
And below that...

04:30.812 --> 04:32.732
Lies the land of the forgotten.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.779
The sad and lonely destination
for those poor souls...

04:37.819 --> 04:39.319
Who are no longer remembered.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.453
But before I can properly
begin our story...

04:42.491 --> 04:46.661
You need to meet the two magical rulers
of these realms.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.333
Who is that?

04:48.372 --> 04:50.542
That is LA muerte.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.382
She is made out of sweet sugar candy.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.998
She's so pretty.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.295
She is, isn't she?

04:56.338 --> 04:57.958
She loves all mankind...

04:58.006 --> 05:00.376
And believes that their hearts
are pure and true.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.049
And that is xibalba.

05:03.095 --> 05:08.185
That charming rascal thinks mankind
is not so pure, just like him.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.895
He looks spooky.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.517
Yes, he's made out of tar
and everything icky in the whole world.

05:13.564 --> 05:14.694
He's so...

05:14.731 --> 05:16.271
Pretty.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.567
What about the weirdo with the beard-o?

05:20.779 --> 05:25.529
That is the candle maker.
He keeps everything in balance.

05:25.576 --> 05:28.616
He's made out of wax
and has a beard full of clouds.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.832
Clouds?

05:29.872 --> 05:32.372
All right.
Let me show you something else.

05:32.416 --> 05:33.876
All of these wooden figures here...

05:34.418 --> 05:37.838
Represent real people in our story,
just like you and me.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.460
Whoa.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.508
And so, our tale begins...

05:41.758 --> 05:43.508
On the day the people of Mexico call...

05:44.219 --> 05:46.179
The day of the dead.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.471
No retreat.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.774
No surrender!

05:52.102 --> 05:53.902
On this festive, enchanted day...

05:54.521 --> 05:56.151
Families bring food and offerings...

05:56.190 --> 05:57.480
To the altars of their beloved.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.244
It's like a hundred birthday parties.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.277
Yes, it is.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.702
And on this particular
day of the dead...

06:03.739 --> 06:06.319
After centuries of being banished...

06:06.366 --> 06:08.326
Xibalba had had enough.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.488
Really, my dear...

06:09.536 --> 06:14.036
You have no idea how cold and vile
the land of the forgotten has become.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.337
Just like your heart, xibalba.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.457
Just like your heart.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.051
Why must I rule a bleak wasteland...

06:25.093 --> 06:28.513
While you enjoy the endless fiesta
in the land of the remembered?

06:28.555 --> 06:29.965
It's simply unfair.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.390
Xibalba!

06:31.433 --> 06:33.393
What? It's his time.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.435
More or less.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.405
Not today, my love.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.608
Come on, my dear. Trade lands with me.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.150
I beg you!

06:41.985 --> 06:44.945
You're so cute when you beg.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.069
I'm serious. I hate it down there.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.529
Hey. You're there because you cheated!

06:49.576 --> 06:51.656
You made your bed with that wager.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.246
You're not the man I fell in love with...

06:54.289 --> 06:55.829
All those centuries ago.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.130
Let's not dwell in the past, mi Amor.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.959
Anyway, I was thinking...

07:03.006 --> 07:05.126
How about another little wager?

07:05.175 --> 07:08.085
You think you can calm the
flames of my anger with another bet?

07:11.265 --> 07:13.855
What exactly did you have in mind?

07:15.978 --> 07:18.518
Let's check out the menu
for the evening.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.687
Look there, my love.
Classic mortal dilemma.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.527
Two boys. Best friends, no less.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.817
In love with the same girl.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.665
Fear not, señorita.
Your hero has arrived!

07:31.034 --> 07:32.124
Is that so?

07:32.160 --> 07:35.160
How dare you interrupt a guitarrista?

07:44.006 --> 07:45.126
The girl is mine.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.014
Never!

07:46.049 --> 07:47.509
She is mine.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.051
I belong...

07:49.052 --> 07:50.932
To no one.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.221
Whoa.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.848
I believe we have our wager.
Which boy will marry her?

07:56.894 --> 07:57.894
Very well.

07:58.729 --> 08:02.479
We will each choose one of these boys
as our champion.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.531
Let's go wish them luck.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.410
Maria, weren't you grounded?

08:09.072 --> 08:10.702
My father is overreacting.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.741
How was I supposed to know
that chickens don't like baths?

08:14.912 --> 08:18.002
Don't worry. He knows a real man
is protecting you tonight.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.500
You're not even close.

08:19.541 --> 08:20.831
But I have a moustache.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.036
Yeah, just like your grandma.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.050
Maria.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.881
Manolo!

08:35.432 --> 08:36.432
Come, mijo.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.558
Your mother would be so proud of you.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.067
You think she'll come back tonight?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.647
Carmen is here.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.442
But it's more like...

08:48.111 --> 08:51.871
A warm feeling you get
when loved ones are with you.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.911
All of these families have lost someone.

08:54.952 --> 08:56.952
But as long as we remember them...

08:57.287 --> 08:59.077
We can feel their presence with us...

08:59.122 --> 09:00.872
For one night each year.

09:02.459 --> 09:07.209
I just thought I might see her
one more time.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.891
She always smelled like flowers.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.603
I remember her singing.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.396
She was a good woman, that one.

09:22.437 --> 09:25.817
I miss her so much.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.825
Just be still, and you can feel it.

09:30.654 --> 09:35.584
Your mother is here,
along with all our ancestors.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.617
As long as we remember them,
they are with us.

09:39.663 --> 09:44.083
The moment we forget them,
they are truly gone.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.963
I can feel them.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.215
Kind people...

09:49.256 --> 09:51.926
May I please have a bit of your bread?

09:51.967 --> 09:53.797
I am so hungry.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.511
I'm sure mama would want you to have it.

09:56.847 --> 09:57.847
Right, papa?

09:59.183 --> 10:00.643
Thank you, my dear.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.314
In return, you have my blessing.

10:04.354 --> 10:08.484
May your heart be
always pure and courageous.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.725
What do we say, Manolo?

10:09.776 --> 10:12.316
Thank you, señora. Thank you.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.986
Ah, Manolo.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.411
Always giving away stuff for free.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.450
Right, dad?

10:18.202 --> 10:20.202
Joaquin's father, captain mondragon...

10:20.537 --> 10:22.287
Had passed away fighting
the fearsome bandit...

10:22.331 --> 10:24.671
Known as chakal.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.547
Who's in there?

10:32.382 --> 10:36.432
Young sir, may I please
have some of your bread?

10:36.845 --> 10:39.215
I'm so hungry.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.234
This bread is for my father.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.887
And it's delicious.

10:44.269 --> 10:47.769
Well, perhaps
you would consider a trade?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.895
An old medal? Please.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.698
This is no ordinary medal, my boy.

10:53.737 --> 10:57.367
As long as you wear it,
you cannot be hurt.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.197
And it will give you
immeasurable courage.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.584
Really?

11:01.620 --> 11:02.620
Deal.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.174
But keep it hidden.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.209
There is a bandit king...

11:09.253 --> 11:12.633
Who would stop at nothing
to get it back.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.383
Bandit king?

11:14.424 --> 11:15.934
You mean chakal?

11:17.302 --> 11:18.432
Where did he go?

11:20.764 --> 11:23.524
So, then, if my boy marries the girl...

11:23.559 --> 11:26.519
I will finally rule
the land of the remembered.

11:26.562 --> 11:31.112
And if my boy marries the girl,
you will...

11:31.775 --> 11:34.065
You will stop interfering
with the affairs of man!

11:34.111 --> 11:35.111
What?

11:35.571 --> 11:36.741
I can't do that!

11:36.780 --> 11:38.910
Come on. It's the only fun I ever get!

11:39.283 --> 11:40.743
Then the bet is off.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.496
Very well, my dear.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.076
By the ancient rules...

11:48.625 --> 11:49.995
The wager is set.

11:51.295 --> 11:54.305
And, so, the greatest wager
in history began.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.435
Manolo versus joaquin
for the hand of Maria.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.968
Wait. So these ancient gods
picked three little kids to...

12:02.014 --> 12:04.064
Represent the whole world?

12:04.099 --> 12:06.099
- Yeah. Pretty crazy, right?
- Yeah!

12:06.476 --> 12:08.306
Keep going, lady.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.282
You're so cute.

12:29.958 --> 12:30.998
Oh, no.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.793
Not on my watch.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.960
We have to free the animals!

12:36.673 --> 12:37.803
Come on, you guys!

12:37.841 --> 12:39.131
Let's do this!

12:39.176 --> 12:40.176
- Yeah!
- Hold on, Maria.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.219
Don't!

12:44.348 --> 12:46.678
People of San angel, please!

12:46.725 --> 12:48.175
I beg you.

12:48.227 --> 12:49.807
After the revolution...

12:49.853 --> 12:54.863
We need more volunteers
to join this mighty brigade!

13:00.697 --> 13:04.907
A heroic brigade
to protect us from chakal.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.502
Chakal is here!

13:14.545 --> 13:18.055
Freedom!

13:23.762 --> 13:26.222
Maria, what have you done now?

13:26.265 --> 13:28.565
Freedom is coming through!

13:29.560 --> 13:31.020
Stop!

13:44.074 --> 13:45.084
Oh, no!

13:56.461 --> 13:57.801
Whoa.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.755
Oh, dear.

14:00.591 --> 14:01.841
No retreat.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.054
No surrender.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.439
He has the gift.

14:29.786 --> 14:30.946
Great form, mijo.

14:50.641 --> 14:52.101
That's my son!

14:52.142 --> 14:53.772
Thank you, Manolo.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.350
Gracias

14:56.480 --> 14:57.480
oh, my.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.268
What did I miss?

14:59.316 --> 15:00.356
You okay, sir?

15:01.443 --> 15:03.283
You have saved my life.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.320
And I...

15:05.364 --> 15:06.494
quiet, boy. I'm talking.

15:06.532 --> 15:07.532
- But I...
- Quiet.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.042
That girl is in so much trouble!

15:13.413 --> 15:14.623
Uh-oh.

15:14.665 --> 15:18.385
Maria!

15:18.418 --> 15:19.788
I'm sorry, papa.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.627
It's just that I...

15:21.672 --> 15:22.922
Manolo's guitar.

15:24.675 --> 15:25.885
Maria!

15:25.926 --> 15:28.466
This rebellious nonsense ends now!

15:28.512 --> 15:30.972
You are going to become a proper lady.

15:31.014 --> 15:31.724
Why?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.015
Because I said so!

15:33.058 --> 15:34.638
I'm sending you to Spain.

15:34.685 --> 15:38.155
The sisters at the
convent of the perpetual flame of purity...

15:38.188 --> 15:39.308
Will straighten you out.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.896
- What?
- But, papa!

15:40.941 --> 15:43.401
No. It is decided. Now go home!

15:47.739 --> 15:51.239
Joaquin, you are so much
like your father.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.202
This town could use a new hero.

15:54.580 --> 15:55.710
Come.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.499
You are like the son I never had.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.542
My boy, your father
was like a brother to me.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.554
Where do you think you're going?

16:10.596 --> 16:12.426
He can't send Maria away.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.142
Well, fathers do what's best
for their children.

16:15.559 --> 16:16.809
Come along.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.444
I saw how you fought that beast.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.783
You made our ancestors proud.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.449
Do you think Maria was impressed?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.067
Maria and every girl in town.

16:29.615 --> 16:33.415
People said I was the greatest bullfighter
in our family's history...

16:33.452 --> 16:37.792
But it is you, my son,
who will be the greatest Sanchez ever!

16:38.665 --> 16:40.125
They will write songs about you!

16:40.167 --> 16:41.577
And I will sing them!

16:41.919 --> 16:42.959
Wait, what?

16:43.754 --> 16:46.134
I will sing them.

16:46.840 --> 16:51.300
Son, music is not work
fit for a Sanchez bullfighter.

16:51.345 --> 16:52.895
But I want to be a musician.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.970
No. You must focus.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.465
Your training begins at once.

16:56.517 --> 16:59.017
Your grandpa, Luis,
taught me when I was about your age.

16:59.353 --> 17:03.113
Wait, isn't that when that bull
put you in a coma?

17:03.440 --> 17:05.780
Ah, memories.

17:06.026 --> 17:09.146
My only son fighting angry,
thousand-pound beasts.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.413
The family tradition continues.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.198
Yay.

17:16.619 --> 17:21.329
And so, the day came
when Maria would leave to study abroad.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.964
The three amigos would be no more.

17:24.002 --> 17:30.972
Adios, Maria

17:33.720 --> 17:34.720
write soon.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.643
I'm going to go over there.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.440
I'm gonna miss you guys.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.649
We'll be here, waiting.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.610
For as long as it takes.

17:46.650 --> 17:49.360
Don't ever stop playing, okay?

17:49.820 --> 17:50.950
And you.

17:50.988 --> 17:53.778
Don't you ever stop fighting
for what's right.

17:53.824 --> 17:56.794
I got you a present.
You should probably open it now.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.667
Wait a second.
We were supposed to bring gifts?

18:03.834 --> 18:05.544
I named him chuy.

18:05.586 --> 18:06.706
He'll look after you.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.668
I remember you.

18:10.716 --> 18:15.006
I figured you needed
a little part of town to go with you.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.183
Thank you.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.723
Seriously, no one told me
about bringing gifts.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.845
Can you hold chuy for me?

18:23.061 --> 18:26.061
This is to make up for
breaking your guitar.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.033
All aboard!

18:31.737 --> 18:33.197
I gotta go.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.324
Don't forget me!

18:36.366 --> 18:37.366
Maria!

18:37.367 --> 18:38.697
Your bonnet!

18:57.763 --> 19:00.273
Maria!

19:02.726 --> 19:04.266
When you come back...

19:04.311 --> 19:06.941
I will sing for you!

19:06.980 --> 19:09.900
And I will fight for you!

19:14.571 --> 19:18.831
It would be years
before they would see Maria again.

19:21.119 --> 19:24.079
I will wait for you.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.920
I'll be bold

19:28.418 --> 19:30.998
as well as strong

19:31.797 --> 19:32.797
one, two, three.

19:32.798 --> 19:36.048
And use my head

19:36.093 --> 19:38.603
alongside my heart

19:39.930 --> 19:41.010
so tame my flesh

19:43.767 --> 19:45.387
and fix my eyes

19:45.435 --> 19:47.645
one, two, three!
One, two, three!

19:47.688 --> 19:51.398
A tethered mind

19:51.441 --> 19:54.281
freed from the lies

19:56.280 --> 20:00.830
and I'll kneel down

20:01.118 --> 20:05.118
- wait for now
- hey, Manny!

20:05.163 --> 20:09.753
I kneel down

20:09.793 --> 20:13.383
- know my ground
- yes! Just like your father!

20:15.465 --> 20:18.585
'Cause I will wait
I will wait for you

20:18.635 --> 20:21.635
and that's how you finish a bull!

20:23.140 --> 20:24.180
And I will wait

20:24.892 --> 20:28.142
I will wait for you

20:30.856 --> 20:34.976
and I will wait
I will wait for you

20:38.822 --> 20:41.122
I will wait, I will...

20:41.158 --> 20:42.948
I will not wait for you!

20:42.993 --> 20:44.123
Papa, I was on my way.

20:44.161 --> 20:48.001
After years of training, Manolo's
father organized his first bullfight

20:48.415 --> 20:49.995
which, as luck would have it...

20:50.334 --> 20:52.384
Was on the day that Maria returned.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.629
Wait, papa!

20:53.670 --> 20:55.550
Playing all night with those
mariachis brothers!

20:55.923 --> 20:58.013
You want to end up like those bozos?

20:59.009 --> 21:01.639
Okay, Manny, we'll wait outside.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.008
- I don't think Mr. Sanchez likes us.
- You think?

21:04.056 --> 21:05.176
Quiet, you lazy bums!

21:07.351 --> 21:08.351
You live under my roof...

21:08.644 --> 21:10.154
You live under my rules.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.477
You will be a matador!

21:11.522 --> 21:13.272
Papa, this is my life.

21:13.315 --> 21:16.575
All the sanchezes are bullfighters!

21:16.860 --> 21:18.530
Every single one of us.

21:20.656 --> 21:24.576
I was a beast in the arena. A beast!

21:25.035 --> 21:28.115
It's in your blood. It's your destiny.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.173
How many times do I have to say it?

21:30.707 --> 21:32.877
This is not me. This is you.

21:32.918 --> 21:35.708
My son,
joaquin may be the hero of the town...

21:35.754 --> 21:38.514
But today,
you will be the hero of the ring.

21:38.549 --> 21:41.889
If, for once,
you actually finish the bull.

21:41.927 --> 21:44.347
But he finished the bull
the other day in practice!

21:47.349 --> 21:48.349
That did no count.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.980
No. Killing the bull is wrong.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.099
Here we go again.

21:52.688 --> 21:56.858
Kids today, with their long hair
and their no killing stuff.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.190
I'm out of here.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.535
Don't you love your family?

22:03.365 --> 22:06.025
Then go get that bull, mijo.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.906
Don't dishonor our name.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.879
Just be a Sanchez!

22:16.378 --> 22:17.248
Mijo...

22:17.296 --> 22:19.916
He no gonna do it.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.927
Hey, Manolo!

22:23.802 --> 22:25.432
No retreat.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.309
No surrender.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.056
The hero of San angel returns!

22:29.600 --> 22:30.600
Oh, come on.

22:30.601 --> 22:33.061
You didn't think I was gonna miss
your first little bullfight, did you?

22:33.103 --> 22:34.273
And Maria's here, too!

22:35.105 --> 22:37.895
Have you seen her?
I cannot wait to show her these babies.

22:37.941 --> 22:40.531
So, she's back only to see you?

22:40.569 --> 22:41.399
Come on. That's not...

22:41.445 --> 22:43.745
you have your medals,
but I have the bullring.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.280
We'll see which Maria prefers.

22:45.908 --> 22:48.828
It's a good thing you're finally taking
bullfighting seriously.

22:48.869 --> 22:52.659
You should see me in the bullring.
That's where I really do my thing now.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.286
A true Sanchez man.

22:55.292 --> 22:57.542
Those are some big shadows
we live under, huh, buddy?

22:58.295 --> 22:59.885
Huge.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.966
Hey, brother,
may the best man win Maria.

23:06.637 --> 23:08.257
Joaquin!

23:08.305 --> 23:10.605
In honor of Maria's
return from Europe...

23:10.641 --> 23:14.601
The town received a rare visit
from its most noble son...

23:14.645 --> 23:17.275
Who was now a decorated hero.

23:17.314 --> 23:21.824
They say joaquin goes from town to town
saving them from bandits!

23:35.624 --> 23:36.624
Yes!

23:36.667 --> 23:38.127
That's my boy.

23:42.506 --> 23:44.126
Afternoon, my general.

23:44.174 --> 23:46.134
That is a mighty moustache you have.

23:52.307 --> 23:53.427
As expected...

23:53.475 --> 23:56.935
Everyone in town was curious
to see how the young Maria had grown.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.194
The jewel of the town has returned.

23:59.940 --> 24:02.820
And she's going to be helping
at the orphanage.

24:02.860 --> 24:06.820
And I hear she reads books,
like, for fun.

24:06.864 --> 24:07.864
No way!

24:08.532 --> 24:10.372
Señorita posada.

24:11.702 --> 24:12.702
Hola, joaquin.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.830
It's really nice to see you.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.209
And she's so natural!

24:23.881 --> 24:24.881
What?

24:32.389 --> 24:34.019
And they say Manolo...

24:34.057 --> 24:36.227
Might be the greatest Sanchez ever!

24:37.561 --> 24:38.191
Yeah!

24:38.228 --> 24:39.768
That's my boy!

24:39.813 --> 24:41.023
What?

24:41.857 --> 24:45.027
I would like to dedicate this corrida...

24:45.068 --> 24:46.318
To miss Maria posada.

24:47.196 --> 24:49.236
Welcome home, señorita.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.372
I'm allergic to dying!

24:57.414 --> 24:59.754
Especially in the face!

25:20.187 --> 25:21.647
Now, that's a Sanchez!

25:28.070 --> 25:29.070
Manolo!

25:38.080 --> 25:39.870
Wow.

25:40.249 --> 25:41.329
That's my son!

26:01.895 --> 26:05.015
Manolo! Manolo!

26:11.071 --> 26:12.071
Come on, mijo.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.071
For me.

26:14.116 --> 26:16.946
For our family. Be a Sanchez!

26:37.890 --> 26:39.020
No.

26:41.101 --> 26:42.891
Killing the bull is wrong!

26:51.612 --> 26:52.362
See?

26:52.404 --> 26:54.034
I told you he no do it.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.366
Bravo!

26:57.409 --> 26:58.409
Bravo!

26:58.827 --> 27:00.907
We don't have to kill the bull!

27:01.163 --> 27:02.913
Oh, no. Manolo.

27:03.498 --> 27:04.748
Adios, Maria.

27:06.502 --> 27:07.882
Manolo.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.920
Manolo. Get up!

27:14.051 --> 27:14.971
I'm sorry, papa.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.640
Do not make it worse by apologizing!

27:16.678 --> 27:19.758
A Sanchez man never apologizes! Never!

27:19.806 --> 27:21.136
Ever.

27:21.183 --> 27:23.733
If being a bullfighter means...

27:23.769 --> 27:25.979
Killing the bull...

27:26.021 --> 27:28.981
Well, then, I'm no bullfighter.

27:29.024 --> 27:32.194
No. You are no Sanchez.

27:46.416 --> 27:47.786
Victory!

27:49.586 --> 27:51.876
That poor kid never had a chance,
my dear.

27:51.922 --> 27:53.132
Good game, though.

27:53.173 --> 27:54.883
It's not over.

27:56.093 --> 27:57.723
Ay, Maria.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.510
When you were here before

28:03.141 --> 28:05.351
couldn't look you in the eye

28:08.063 --> 28:10.523
you're just like an angel

28:13.360 --> 28:16.200
your skin makes me cry

28:18.740 --> 28:21.280
but I'm a creep

28:24.121 --> 28:27.791
I'm a weirdo

28:29.293 --> 28:33.133
what am I doing here?

28:34.631 --> 28:37.931
I don't belong here

28:39.887 --> 28:44.387
I don't belong

28:46.310 --> 28:47.310
Manolo.

28:47.311 --> 28:49.811
Maria!

28:53.942 --> 28:55.442
What just happened?

28:55.903 --> 28:58.663
You don't know women, my love.

29:00.240 --> 29:04.540
That night, general posada threw
a grand party to welcome Maria back.

29:04.578 --> 29:08.038
But, you see, he had bigger plans.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.541
To joaquin!

29:09.583 --> 29:11.463
A great hero!

29:11.502 --> 29:13.802
Too bad you're just in town
for a few days.

29:13.837 --> 29:17.127
If only there were something
that would make you stay...

29:17.174 --> 29:19.054
Like a special girl.

29:19.092 --> 29:20.142
Eh, Maria?

29:20.177 --> 29:21.087
Papa!

29:21.136 --> 29:22.676
What? What I say?

29:26.183 --> 29:27.773
Oh, my father.

29:27.809 --> 29:31.439
It's so wonderful to see you again,
joaquin.

29:31.480 --> 29:35.570
Look at that mustache.
And all those medals.

29:35.609 --> 29:37.279
What's this one for?

29:37.319 --> 29:38.489
Nothing! Nothing, nothing.

29:38.779 --> 29:39.779
What? I didn't...

29:41.865 --> 29:46.155
why don't you tell me
a little more about europa?

29:46.203 --> 29:48.623
I loved it.

29:48.664 --> 29:52.464
Such beautiful music and art and books.
It was wonderful.

29:53.627 --> 29:56.167
Books, art, wonderfulness.

29:56.213 --> 29:58.383
You sound like you've learned
so much, Maria.

29:58.423 --> 30:00.053
I'm sure one day...

30:00.092 --> 30:02.342
You are going to make a man
very, very, very happy.

30:02.386 --> 30:05.006
And I hope that man's mustache,
or his medals...

30:05.055 --> 30:07.015
Makes you very, very, very, very happy.

30:07.057 --> 30:09.177
Oh, is that so?

30:09.226 --> 30:10.516
Well, yes.

30:10.561 --> 30:14.611
Behind every man with an amazing
mustache is a beautiful woman.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.074
Oh, yes.

30:17.109 --> 30:19.189
And I'll cook and clean for him...

30:19.236 --> 30:21.196
And be at his Beck and call.

30:21.864 --> 30:25.494
That sounds so good.
That just sounds so good.

30:25.534 --> 30:27.124
And you sound...
You're just so pretty.

30:27.744 --> 30:28.744
Are you kidding me?

30:29.454 --> 30:30.374
Oh, boy.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.124
Is that how you see a woman?

30:33.542 --> 30:35.092
We're only here to make men happy?

30:36.753 --> 30:38.253
Yeah.

30:39.089 --> 30:41.219
So, I don't know.

30:41.258 --> 30:44.218
I believe I have lost my appetite.

30:44.261 --> 30:46.851
No, please, please, stay seated.

30:46.889 --> 30:51.229
Now, if you will just excuse me,
I must go check on chuy.

30:51.268 --> 30:53.188
That's my pig.

30:53.228 --> 30:56.938
I need to spend time
with someone civilized.

30:58.734 --> 31:00.944
You've picked yourself a feisty one.

31:03.071 --> 31:06.031
Good one, joaquin! Very witty.

31:06.074 --> 31:09.084
I can't believe the general invited
the whole town!

31:09.578 --> 31:11.248
Except for you, Manolo.

31:11.622 --> 31:13.082
Sorry, bro.

31:13.123 --> 31:14.713
He even invited us.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.460
And he hates us.

31:16.793 --> 31:19.253
It's hopeless. I've lost her to joaquin.

31:19.296 --> 31:21.966
Okay, listen.
All we got to do is play the right song...

31:22.007 --> 31:26.217
And trust me, everything will turn around
in the space of four bars.

31:26.261 --> 31:28.431
We've already been to four bars!

31:28.472 --> 31:29.512
Twice!

31:29.973 --> 31:32.603
Hold it. I know exactly what to play.

31:32.643 --> 31:33.643
It has to be romantic...

31:33.977 --> 31:35.057
And classy...

31:35.103 --> 31:37.483
But with tons of dignity.

31:41.276 --> 31:46.446
You, you got what I need

31:46.490 --> 31:49.280
but you say he's just a friend

31:49.326 --> 31:51.446
but you say he's just a friend

31:51.495 --> 31:53.295
oh, baby, you...

31:58.001 --> 31:59.841
wow, that totally captivated her.

31:59.878 --> 32:01.838
I don't get it. That one always works.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.340
Even on my wife.

32:04.007 --> 32:05.717
Wait. You're married?

32:06.176 --> 32:08.216
I got it! Follow my lead.

32:09.513 --> 32:13.023
If you want my body
and you think I'm sexy

32:13.058 --> 32:15.478
mami vamos, let me know

32:25.487 --> 32:27.027
very romantic, pepe.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.620
That's all I got, mang.

32:30.659 --> 32:31.989
Okay, my turn!

32:32.035 --> 32:35.035
One, two,
one, two, tres, cuatro!

32:35.747 --> 32:38.287
That girl is way out of your league, bro.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.503
Hey, let's eat!

33:09.615 --> 33:13.205
I love you too much

33:13.243 --> 33:16.663
to live without you loving me back

33:16.705 --> 33:19.455
I love you too much

33:20.417 --> 33:21.837
heaven's my witness

33:21.877 --> 33:23.587
and this is a fact

33:23.629 --> 33:26.879
I know I belong

33:26.924 --> 33:29.974
when I sing this song

33:30.594 --> 33:32.934
there's love above love and it's ours

33:32.971 --> 33:36.471
'cause I love you too much

33:37.518 --> 33:40.688
I live for your touch

33:41.438 --> 33:44.358
I whisper your name night after night

33:44.983 --> 33:47.943
I love you too much

33:47.986 --> 33:51.446
there's only one feeling
and I know it's right

33:51.490 --> 33:54.280
I know I belong

33:55.035 --> 33:57.535
when I sing this song

33:58.455 --> 34:03.785
there's love above love and it's ours
'cause I love you too much

34:06.505 --> 34:11.685
heaven knows your name
I've been praying

34:12.302 --> 34:16.722
to have you come here by my side

34:20.476 --> 34:25.647
without you a part of me's missing

34:25.983 --> 34:32.663
just to make you my own I will fight

34:33.239 --> 34:38.500
I love you too much

34:40.163 --> 34:43.333
I love you too much

34:44.001 --> 34:47.130
heaven's my witness and this is a fact

34:47.170 --> 34:50.511
you live in my soul

34:50.549 --> 34:53.009
your heart is my goal

34:54.052 --> 34:55.181
there's love above love

34:55.554 --> 34:57.644
and it's mine
'cause I love you

34:57.681 --> 35:01.021
there's love above love and it's yours
'cause I love you

35:01.059 --> 35:04.189
there's love above love and it's ours

35:04.229 --> 35:08.689
if you love me as much

35:11.612 --> 35:13.212
did you think it was gonna be that easy?

35:19.119 --> 35:21.119
I kind of did.

35:22.372 --> 35:24.212
Manolo!

35:25.042 --> 35:26.382
Hold on, I'm coming.

35:33.342 --> 35:34.342
Joaquin.

35:35.552 --> 35:36.792
- What are you doing?
- Maria...

35:38.764 --> 35:41.434
Will you marry me?

35:42.684 --> 35:43.854
Yes.

35:44.269 --> 35:46.729
Don't worry,
your father already said you could.

35:46.772 --> 35:49.022
He did... what?

35:50.609 --> 35:53.239
Who else could protect us from chakal?

36:08.627 --> 36:10.087
What did I miss?

36:11.296 --> 36:12.586
Wait a sec.

36:12.923 --> 36:15.223
Did he propose, too?

36:15.259 --> 36:16.549
No.

36:16.593 --> 36:18.013
Were you going to?

36:18.053 --> 36:18.763
What?

36:18.804 --> 36:22.854
Well, I proposed first.
So, go fight a bull or something.

36:22.891 --> 36:24.681
You two are acting like fools!

36:24.726 --> 36:25.806
Wait, me too?

36:27.145 --> 36:29.055
You're so strong, joaquin.

36:29.106 --> 36:30.896
Thanks, I work out a lot.

36:31.441 --> 36:32.731
I love you, you know that.

36:32.776 --> 36:34.236
But how are you
going to protect Maria...

36:34.278 --> 36:36.318
If you can't even finish a bull?

36:38.615 --> 36:40.025
Good one, joaquin!

36:40.075 --> 36:43.655
Oh, yeah? Well, you will never be
as great a hero as your father!

36:46.790 --> 36:48.250
Now, that's just uncalled for.

36:48.292 --> 36:49.962
You better get your finger
out of my face.

36:50.002 --> 36:53.422
- You don't point at me!
- I'm the best pointer you've ever seen!

36:53.463 --> 36:56.013
That's so stupid, so childish.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.129
Joaquin!

36:58.302 --> 36:59.512
Come at me, bro!

36:59.553 --> 37:00.893
Manolo!

37:03.307 --> 37:04.017
What?

37:04.057 --> 37:05.727
- You wanted a banjo?
- Look at him!

37:05.767 --> 37:07.937
He got his guitar.
What are you gonna do?

37:07.978 --> 37:09.438
LA música!
I'm so scared!

37:09.813 --> 37:11.563
I'm gonna teach you some manners.

37:11.815 --> 37:12.815
Joaquin!

37:17.654 --> 37:19.954
Did I mention I also studied fencing?

37:19.990 --> 37:22.120
Fine. We'll settle this later.

37:22.159 --> 37:24.159
Any time. Any place.

37:24.745 --> 37:25.755
Really, guys?

37:26.496 --> 37:27.786
No!

37:27.831 --> 37:29.541
Don't go, joaquin!

37:29.583 --> 37:30.753
What if the bandidos come?

37:32.336 --> 37:34.706
The bandidos are coming!

37:34.755 --> 37:36.305
And joaquin is gone!

37:36.340 --> 37:38.430
All is lost

37:41.512 --> 37:46.272
tremble in fear
before the might of chakal's army!

37:46.308 --> 37:48.888
Women and children, go to the church!

37:48.936 --> 37:52.266
Men, we are going to drive
chakal's bandits off!

37:52.314 --> 37:54.694
Who is with me?

37:57.819 --> 37:59.069
This is not good.

37:59.112 --> 38:00.822
Listen up, you cowards!

38:00.864 --> 38:04.664
These are chakal's demands!

38:04.701 --> 38:06.331
"Hand over your chickens...

38:06.370 --> 38:07.370
"Monies...

38:07.371 --> 38:08.291
"Bacon...

38:08.330 --> 38:09.250
"Jars...

38:09.289 --> 38:10.789
"Mustache wax."

38:10.832 --> 38:13.712
This looks like "jelly"
but I think it's "jewelry."

38:14.336 --> 38:15.376
Yeah, jewelry.

38:15.629 --> 38:18.669
Anyways, if you give all this to us...

38:18.715 --> 38:21.335
Then maybe we won't burn...

38:21.385 --> 38:22.685
Your town down.

38:24.805 --> 38:28.685
You want the town?
You're gonna have to go through me!

38:29.977 --> 38:31.807
Hey, ugly!

38:31.854 --> 38:33.774
Why don't you fight a real man?

38:33.814 --> 38:36.824
With a really awesome mustache!

38:36.859 --> 38:39.649
Joaquin!

38:42.865 --> 38:44.955
Thank goodness you are here!

38:46.368 --> 38:47.868
Here, hold this.

38:47.911 --> 38:49.911
And this. And this.

38:49.955 --> 38:53.635
And if that's too heavy,
maybe you can just hand it to Maria.

38:54.209 --> 38:58.049
My name is joaquin,
son of captain mondragon!

38:58.088 --> 39:00.718
Tonight, the town of San angel...

39:00.757 --> 39:03.047
Is under my protection.

39:03.927 --> 39:04.927
Prepare to be beaten.

39:06.096 --> 39:07.096
Get him, plomo!

39:09.266 --> 39:10.846
Joaquin!

39:10.893 --> 39:11.893
Joaquin!

39:13.061 --> 39:15.361
Who wants some more?

39:15.397 --> 39:16.977
Get him!

39:17.900 --> 39:18.900
Hey, girl.

39:19.568 --> 39:20.688
You goofball.

39:26.909 --> 39:28.619
All right,
that's just not hurting at all.

39:28.660 --> 39:29.740
The beautiful hero!

39:29.786 --> 39:31.996
He has the medal of everlasting life!

39:32.748 --> 39:35.208
Joaquin!

39:42.049 --> 39:43.679
Retreat!

39:43.717 --> 39:45.387
And don't ever come back!

39:45.844 --> 39:48.014
Yeah! You better run away!

39:48.055 --> 39:49.265
That was incredible.

39:49.306 --> 39:51.766
Yeah, you really are a hero.

39:52.643 --> 39:53.893
Perhaps now...

39:53.936 --> 39:58.146
We possibly could continue
our conversation, señorita posada?

39:58.857 --> 40:02.687
Maria, please, do it for the town.

40:02.736 --> 40:04.236
Without joaquin...

40:04.279 --> 40:06.659
We are at the mercy of chakal.

40:08.534 --> 40:12.544
So, why don't you tell me about
some of your medals?

40:13.205 --> 40:16.425
Well, I got this one
for delivering a baby with one hand...

40:16.458 --> 40:18.748
While arm wrestling a bear with the other.
That's nothing, really.

40:18.794 --> 40:21.214
Duh. Of course she's gonna go
with joaquin.

40:21.255 --> 40:22.845
And did you see that mustache?

40:22.881 --> 40:23.881
Are you crazy?

40:23.924 --> 40:25.804
Maria is doing this to protect the town.

40:25.843 --> 40:28.393
- Putting her duty before her heart.
- Yes.

40:29.012 --> 40:31.472
Life can be really tough for the living.

40:31.515 --> 40:34.235
Failing in and out of the ring.

40:34.268 --> 40:37.268
The whole Sanchez family
would be so...

40:37.312 --> 40:38.652
Disappointed in you.

40:39.940 --> 40:41.780
Please, don't say that.

40:42.526 --> 40:44.526
Listen. You love Maria?

40:44.570 --> 40:46.360
Then fight for her, like a man!

40:47.573 --> 40:50.873
It's too late.
Joaquin proposed to her already.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.949
- Now, that's a real man.
- Quiet, Carlos!

40:53.620 --> 40:54.790
Manolo...

40:54.830 --> 40:57.790
If Maria didn't say yes to joaquin...

40:57.833 --> 40:59.583
Then she said no.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.670
So, what are you gonna do about it, son?

41:07.885 --> 41:10.515
After stealing xibalba's magic medal
in a battle...

41:10.554 --> 41:13.144
Chakal had risen to become
the king of the bandits.

41:13.182 --> 41:17.062
But when xibalba stole it back,
chakal had come undone.

41:18.520 --> 41:22.980
We found the medal!
The medal of everlasting life!

41:23.025 --> 41:24.785
It's in the town of San angel.

41:26.153 --> 41:28.533
- Are you certain?
- I swear! I swear!

41:28.572 --> 41:30.992
A beautiful hero wears it
to protect the town!

41:31.033 --> 41:32.913
It looked just like that.

41:33.452 --> 41:35.202
Gather my men.

41:35.245 --> 41:37.155
We ride for San angel.

41:38.081 --> 41:42.541
You've come back to me, medal.

41:42.586 --> 41:44.546
I got this one for saving some orphans
from a fire...

41:44.588 --> 41:46.798
And then going back in for their cribs,
and then going back in for their toys.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.840
And then I also saved a little puppy one
time that had a little Thorn in its paw.

41:48.884 --> 41:51.014
And this medal is for
having the most medals.

41:51.053 --> 41:52.683
Well, here we are.

41:52.721 --> 41:57.311
Thank you for this most informative
talk about you.

41:57.976 --> 41:59.766
I have something for you, Maria.

41:59.811 --> 42:01.601
That is so nice of...

42:02.898 --> 42:03.938
Wow.

42:03.982 --> 42:04.982
I'm speechless.

42:04.983 --> 42:07.363
I know. Right? I get that a lot.

42:08.904 --> 42:10.784
Good night, joaquin.

42:11.865 --> 42:12.865
Wait. Maria.

42:12.866 --> 42:13.866
Yes?

42:14.451 --> 42:16.241
My bonnet.

42:17.871 --> 42:19.871
You kept it all this time?

42:19.915 --> 42:22.465
Well, it's what's kept me going.

42:24.211 --> 42:28.261
About my proposal,
will you at least just think about it?

42:31.510 --> 42:33.510
Good night, joaquin.

42:33.554 --> 42:35.644
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

42:35.681 --> 42:37.101
Joaquin, you're awesome!

42:37.140 --> 42:38.140
Yes!

42:47.359 --> 42:49.279
Meet me at the bridge at dawn.

42:49.319 --> 42:50.739
I can't. My father won't...

42:50.779 --> 42:53.319
please, Maria. I beg you.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.039
If she meets him alone...

43:03.083 --> 43:04.713
I will lose the wager.

43:06.086 --> 43:09.416
Fix this for me, old friend.

43:32.905 --> 43:33.955
Manolo.

43:33.989 --> 43:38.029
Wise men say...

43:38.577 --> 43:43.457
Only fools rush in

43:44.208 --> 43:46.918
but I can't help...

43:48.378 --> 43:52.088
Falling in love with you

43:54.843 --> 43:58.813
but I can't help...

43:58.847 --> 44:01.097
Falling in love...

44:01.558 --> 44:05.938
With you

44:12.903 --> 44:16.913
this is what I wanted to show you.

44:17.824 --> 44:20.414
It's so beautiful.

44:22.162 --> 44:23.792
What you're feeling...

44:23.830 --> 44:26.790
That's how I feel
every time I'm with you.

44:27.876 --> 44:29.706
I can't offer you a ring.

44:29.753 --> 44:32.673
I have nothing to give but my love.

44:32.714 --> 44:34.384
Oh, Manolo.

44:34.424 --> 44:36.434
I may not be the town hero, Maria...

44:36.468 --> 44:39.258
But I swear with all my heart...

44:39.304 --> 44:42.024
I will never, ever stop loving you.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.350
And I will never stop loving the man...

44:45.394 --> 44:47.604
Who plays from the heart.

44:49.356 --> 44:50.516
- Snake!
- No!

44:53.110 --> 44:54.110
Maria!

45:02.953 --> 45:03.953
No.

45:07.666 --> 45:08.876
Help!

45:25.601 --> 45:27.141
What did you do, Manolo?

45:27.686 --> 45:29.096
There was a snake and...

45:30.939 --> 45:32.189
She's gone.

45:32.232 --> 45:33.482
Why didn't you protect her?

45:33.525 --> 45:34.435
Maria!

45:34.484 --> 45:37.784
Oh, no. Oh, no!

45:40.490 --> 45:42.620
This is all your doing! Leave!

45:42.659 --> 45:45.289
Or so help me, I'll...

45:46.580 --> 45:48.580
my little girl.

45:49.041 --> 45:51.081
What have you done, boy?

45:51.793 --> 45:53.923
What have you done?

45:53.962 --> 45:55.632
It should have been me.

45:55.672 --> 45:58.172
Yes. It should have.

46:01.845 --> 46:03.045
No!

46:03.096 --> 46:04.346
Maria died?

46:04.389 --> 46:05.719
That can't be right!

46:05.766 --> 46:08.056
What kind of story is this?
We're just kids!

46:09.436 --> 46:12.106
As the sky cried with rain...

46:12.147 --> 46:15.227
Manolo went back to retrieve his guitar.

46:16.318 --> 46:18.648
I will never see her again.

46:20.322 --> 46:21.362
Are you certain?

46:22.866 --> 46:26.156
You want to see Maria again?

46:26.703 --> 46:28.503
With all my heart.

46:28.539 --> 46:29.909
Think about what you say...

46:30.332 --> 46:31.792
Boy.

46:35.045 --> 46:38.205
With all my heart.

46:38.841 --> 46:39.841
Done.

46:44.054 --> 46:45.434
Maria...

46:51.478 --> 46:52.728
No!

46:52.771 --> 46:54.061
Manolo, too?

46:54.106 --> 46:56.066
What is it with Mexicans and death?

46:56.108 --> 46:59.028
But it can't end like this. Can it?

46:59.319 --> 47:02.319
Oh, my sweet child,
this is not the end.

47:38.525 --> 47:39.395
Welcome...

47:39.443 --> 47:42.823
To the land of the remembered!

47:42.863 --> 47:44.203
I made it.

47:44.239 --> 47:45.569
And on the day of the dead, no less.

47:45.616 --> 47:47.156
Where is...

47:47.201 --> 47:49.121
You're going to be
a little disoriented at first.

47:49.161 --> 47:51.751
Don't try to take it all in at once.

47:51.788 --> 47:53.418
Let's start with your name.

47:53.707 --> 47:54.577
Maria posada!

47:54.625 --> 47:55.715
Really?

47:55.751 --> 47:58.341
Parents and their crazy baby names.

47:58.378 --> 48:01.338
And there's no Maria posada on my list.

48:01.381 --> 48:02.721
No, no.

48:02.758 --> 48:05.298
I'm looking for Maria posada.

48:05.969 --> 48:07.509
My name is Manolo Sanchez.

48:08.013 --> 48:09.263
Another Sanchez?

48:09.306 --> 48:11.056
Man, that family just keeps growing.

48:11.099 --> 48:13.019
My family! They'll help me find Maria!

48:13.060 --> 48:14.810
Can you take me to them?

48:14.853 --> 48:17.773
I would love nothing more
than to reunite a young couple.

48:17.814 --> 48:21.324
Just hold on!

48:29.034 --> 48:32.664
I've been down here for years...

48:32.704 --> 48:34.084
Awaiting my beloved honey bunny.

48:34.456 --> 48:35.996
Hi, honey!

48:36.583 --> 48:37.833
Too soon! Go!

48:39.753 --> 48:43.133
The land of the remembered
was vibrant and joyous!

48:43.173 --> 48:44.923
Everything was like the land above...

48:44.967 --> 48:47.007
But it was more colorful...

48:47.052 --> 48:49.642
It was more beautiful,
it was more festive!

48:49.680 --> 48:51.220
And, on the day of the dead...

48:51.265 --> 48:55.895
That place was bursting with
endless parties and spectacular parades.

48:55.936 --> 48:57.936
There, your family is in that one.

49:00.023 --> 49:01.443
Wow.

49:01.483 --> 49:02.573
Get in there!

49:07.614 --> 49:08.704
Oh, yeah!

49:08.740 --> 49:10.780
Another Sanchez bullfighter.

49:10.826 --> 49:11.826
You are...

49:12.160 --> 49:14.750
The amazing carmelo Sanchez!

49:14.788 --> 49:16.208
Yes! I was famous...

49:16.999 --> 49:19.829
For fighting bulls without a cape!

49:21.461 --> 49:23.761
Capes are for cowards!

49:24.089 --> 49:25.879
Can you help me find Maria posada?

49:25.924 --> 49:29.894
LA muerte can help you.
She helps everyone. Hold on.

49:33.765 --> 49:36.885
The great Jorge Sanchez!

49:36.935 --> 49:38.515
At your service!

49:38.562 --> 49:40.522
I was famous for fighting bulls...

49:40.564 --> 49:43.324
With only one arm and one leg.

49:44.818 --> 49:47.068
Arms and legs are for cowards!

49:48.572 --> 49:51.162
You are Manolo,
the one who plays the guitar.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.780
Yeah, that's me.

49:52.826 --> 49:57.866
You know, when I was younger,
I always dreamt of singing in the opera.

49:57.915 --> 49:58.915
You did?

49:58.916 --> 50:00.126
But as you know...

50:00.167 --> 50:04.207
Music is not work
fit for a Sanchez bullfighter.

50:04.755 --> 50:06.055
The same story.

50:06.089 --> 50:08.009
They crushed our dreams. Hilarious.

50:10.219 --> 50:12.679
- He's new.
- He reminds me of me.

50:12.721 --> 50:13.931
But less handsome.

50:19.561 --> 50:20.811
Of course!

50:20.854 --> 50:23.694
It's Luis "El super macho" Sanchez!

50:23.732 --> 50:24.732
I was famous...

50:25.192 --> 50:27.782
For fighting three bulls at once!

50:30.906 --> 50:33.776
One bull is for cowards!

50:35.035 --> 50:37.695
Grandpa! It's me, Manolo.

50:38.038 --> 50:41.418
Manolo? I'm so happy to see you.

50:41.458 --> 50:45.338
Why you disgrace the family name?
Playing the guitar!

50:45.379 --> 50:47.839
You couldn't finish one bull?

50:47.881 --> 50:49.631
You were a clown.

50:51.051 --> 50:52.761
Sorry, cousin chucho.

50:53.387 --> 50:55.217
Welcome home, mijo.

50:55.264 --> 50:58.104
Your mother will be very happy
to see you.

51:00.561 --> 51:01.561
Mama?

51:09.987 --> 51:11.317
Manolo.

51:12.114 --> 51:13.324
Mama.

51:14.575 --> 51:16.335
Manolo!

51:21.039 --> 51:24.329
I missed you so much.

51:24.710 --> 51:27.920
Ay, mijo,
it's been like a hole in my heart.

51:27.963 --> 51:30.513
I've waited so long for you.

51:31.675 --> 51:32.675
But not long enough!

51:33.051 --> 51:34.761
What are you doing here?

51:34.803 --> 51:38.813
I'm here to be reunited
with the love of my life.

51:38.849 --> 51:41.019
You're going to love Maria, mama.

51:41.518 --> 51:43.138
I'm sure I will.

51:43.187 --> 51:46.017
Manolo, you look just like your father.

51:46.648 --> 51:48.688
So handsome, you turned out.

51:48.734 --> 51:52.204
And I became a bullfighter,
just like you wanted.

51:52.237 --> 51:54.317
Me? Are you crazy?

51:54.364 --> 51:56.834
Haven't you learned anything
from your family's history?

51:56.867 --> 51:58.027
What? But dad said that...

51:58.410 --> 51:59.990
that Carlos.

52:00.037 --> 52:02.207
Wait until he gets down here.

52:02.247 --> 52:04.327
Now, come on, mijo!

52:04.374 --> 52:06.214
Everyone, this is my son, Manolo!

52:10.714 --> 52:14.264
And these are your adelita cousins.
They fought in the revolution.

52:14.718 --> 52:15.718
And we won.

52:15.761 --> 52:16.851
No way!

52:16.887 --> 52:18.137
Hey, primo.

52:18.180 --> 52:20.560
Being with the whole Sanchez family...

52:20.933 --> 52:22.853
And you, mama.

52:22.893 --> 52:24.023
This is incredible.

52:24.061 --> 52:26.771
This is LA muerte's castle.

52:28.398 --> 52:29.858
I don't see it.

52:31.610 --> 52:32.860
Savage.

52:32.903 --> 52:35.243
Come, she will help you find
my new daughter-in-law.

52:40.577 --> 52:42.367
It's so pretty!

52:42.412 --> 52:44.372
Now, this is a castle!

52:44.414 --> 52:46.544
We were always LA muerte's favorites.

52:46.875 --> 52:50.045
You know how bullfighters
flirt with death, eh?

52:50.087 --> 52:52.627
And that's why there are
so many of you down here.

53:00.764 --> 53:05.274
LA muerte's throwing a big
day of the dead fiesta for everyone!

53:08.480 --> 53:10.270
Savage.

53:17.322 --> 53:19.322
Ask her, mijo.

53:19.366 --> 53:22.616
My lady,
could you help me find Maria posada?

53:23.287 --> 53:26.247
No one here can help you, bullfighter.

53:28.292 --> 53:30.792
The land of the remembered
has a new ruler!

53:36.633 --> 53:38.763
Who, you ask? Lil' old me.

53:38.802 --> 53:39.932
You again?

53:39.970 --> 53:43.310
But LA muerte would never hand
her domain over to you.

53:44.349 --> 53:45.599
She lost a bet.

53:45.976 --> 53:48.306
Ah. She would do that.

53:48.353 --> 53:50.613
This land is finally mine!

53:50.647 --> 53:52.607
All thanks to you, Manolo.

53:52.649 --> 53:53.439
What?

53:53.483 --> 53:56.113
LA muerte
bet that Maria would marry you.

53:56.153 --> 53:58.953
I bet that Maria would marry joaquin.

54:00.490 --> 54:03.240
And since you're not around anymore...

54:03.285 --> 54:08.085
Maria is going to marry joaquin just to,
you know, protect her beloved town.

54:08.123 --> 54:09.793
So, I win.

54:09.833 --> 54:11.633
No, but Maria passed away.

54:11.668 --> 54:13.248
I saw her.

54:13.295 --> 54:14.805
Oh, no.

54:14.838 --> 54:16.838
Oh, yes.

54:17.549 --> 54:18.969
Mijo, what is it?

54:19.009 --> 54:20.679
One snake bite
merely put her in a trance.

54:21.637 --> 54:24.347
My champion easily woke...

54:24.806 --> 54:26.676
The sleeping beauty.

54:28.519 --> 54:30.809
Oh, my goodness. It's a miracle!

54:30.854 --> 54:32.694
Thank you

54:33.148 --> 54:35.028
I'm... I'm...

54:35.526 --> 54:37.606
Alive.

54:37.653 --> 54:38.653
Cheers.

54:39.321 --> 54:41.531
One bite? Your snake!

54:41.573 --> 54:43.323
It bit me twice!

54:43.367 --> 54:44.487
You cheated!

54:44.535 --> 54:46.335
You will pay for this!

54:52.251 --> 54:54.841
In all my years, no one, in any realm...

54:54.878 --> 54:56.838
Has ever talked to me like that...

54:56.880 --> 54:58.840
And survived.

54:58.882 --> 55:00.472
So, I ask you...

55:00.509 --> 55:02.089
Are you threatening me, boy?

55:02.511 --> 55:04.051
I will expose you to LA muerte.

55:04.096 --> 55:06.676
And then you and me can settle things!

55:07.558 --> 55:09.518
You'll never reach her in her new realm.

55:09.560 --> 55:13.230
I should know. I rotted there for eons.

55:15.190 --> 55:18.740
Now, if you'd all excuse me,
I have a wedding to plan.

55:33.542 --> 55:35.292
What happened?

55:36.420 --> 55:37.920
Wait, where's Manolo?

55:37.963 --> 55:39.423
I'm sorry, Maria.

55:40.424 --> 55:41.634
Manolo...

55:42.259 --> 55:43.259
Manolo passed away.

55:44.720 --> 55:47.430
No. It can't be.

55:48.724 --> 55:50.394
I'm sorry, dear.

55:58.775 --> 56:02.275
Maria, we are all sorry Manolo is gone...

56:02.779 --> 56:05.989
But joaquin just saved your life.

56:06.033 --> 56:09.083
You see? He will always protect you.

56:09.119 --> 56:11.039
General, this is not the time.

56:12.414 --> 56:15.334
Please, for everyone's sake, mija.

56:15.375 --> 56:17.535
Make him stay.

56:18.962 --> 56:21.972
Will you stay in San angel
if I marry you?

56:22.633 --> 56:23.933
Yes, but you don't...

56:23.967 --> 56:26.467
I accept joaquin's proposal.

56:27.095 --> 56:29.635
Ah, young love.

56:30.474 --> 56:32.854
I have to find LA muerte! Please.

56:32.893 --> 56:34.733
Please, help me.

56:34.770 --> 56:36.940
Mijo, stay here with us.

56:36.980 --> 56:37.980
No more worries.

56:37.981 --> 56:39.901
Epic fiestas every day.

56:39.942 --> 56:41.942
With the whole Sanchez family.

56:41.985 --> 56:44.895
And all-you-can-eat churros.

56:46.073 --> 56:48.583
Thank you, guys. But, no.

56:48.617 --> 56:50.447
I need to be with Maria.

56:50.494 --> 56:52.044
It's all I ever wanted.

56:52.079 --> 56:54.289
How's Manolo gonna get back?

56:54.331 --> 56:56.041
He's stuck there forever!

56:56.083 --> 56:57.753
And Maria is gonna marry joaquin!

56:58.836 --> 57:01.496
All right, do you want me to continue?

57:01.922 --> 57:03.132
So, one thing was for sure...

57:03.173 --> 57:05.053
Manolo needed help from his family.

57:05.092 --> 57:07.392
If LA muerte
is where xibalba rotted away...

57:07.427 --> 57:09.047
Then she's in the land of the forgotten.

57:09.096 --> 57:11.056
- No, no, no.
- Quiet, you!

57:11.098 --> 57:15.688
Manolo, there's only one way
to get to the land of the forgotten.

57:16.019 --> 57:20.319
Through the cave of souls

57:20.357 --> 57:22.817
going there would be certain doom!

57:22.860 --> 57:24.780
Well...

57:24.820 --> 57:26.530
It's a good day for doom.

57:28.365 --> 57:30.115
He's a Sanchez, I tell you!

57:30.158 --> 57:32.828
A Sanchez!

57:33.328 --> 57:35.998
This is impossible!

57:36.039 --> 57:38.499
Hey! Good luck, little Sanchez!

57:38.959 --> 57:40.959
The legendary cave of souls...

57:41.003 --> 57:43.633
Was rumored to be at the edge
of the land of the remembered.

57:43.672 --> 57:48.472
Now, many had tried to reach it,
but none had ever returned.

57:48.510 --> 57:49.890
At least, not in one piece.

57:55.851 --> 57:59.311
Caramba, it hurts just looking at it.

58:00.147 --> 58:03.187
Why couldn't this be the elevator of souls?

58:03.233 --> 58:05.243
My arthritis is killing me!

58:05.694 --> 58:06.904
Are we there yet?

58:12.201 --> 58:13.991
We made it, mijo.

58:14.745 --> 58:17.255
Come on! What are you guys waiting for?

58:18.248 --> 58:20.078
You are not worthy!

58:22.002 --> 58:24.632
Hey! My arthritis is gone!

58:24.671 --> 58:25.711
Grandpa!

58:28.050 --> 58:29.050
Mama!

58:31.428 --> 58:32.428
Manolo!

58:32.763 --> 58:34.183
Face the labyrinth...

58:34.681 --> 58:37.771
And earn the right to be judged.

58:51.823 --> 58:53.623
I can't see him! Lift me up!

58:53.951 --> 58:55.041
I see him!

58:59.164 --> 59:00.164
Where did he go?

59:03.502 --> 59:04.422
Uh-oh.

59:04.461 --> 59:06.131
What? What's happening?

59:06.171 --> 59:08.841
It's okay, honey. He's totally okay.

59:09.591 --> 59:10.591
Run for your life!

59:33.448 --> 59:36.118
That was so beautiful.

59:39.288 --> 59:40.708
You have earned...

59:40.747 --> 59:43.457
The right to be judged.

59:44.334 --> 59:45.504
But be warned.

59:45.544 --> 59:48.554
No mortal has ever passed.

59:50.465 --> 59:52.925
For Maria.

59:54.428 --> 59:55.758
Manolo!

01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:02.937
Manolo Sanchez...

01:00:02.978 --> 01:00:07.228
Your heart is pure and courageous.

01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:09.734
You and yours may enter.

01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:12.783
Don't do that again!

01:00:17.618 --> 01:00:19.658
This is the cave of souls?

01:00:20.037 --> 01:00:22.497
Grandpa! Show some respect.

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:23.789
That...

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:25.124
Was...

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:26.842
Awesome, man!

01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:28.497
Look, the giant boulders were like...

01:00:28.545 --> 01:00:31.005
"Boom, boom, boom!"
And then, you were, like...

01:00:32.341 --> 01:00:34.761
And then, the cave guardian
came in, and he was like...

01:00:34.801 --> 01:00:37.351
"I'm going to judge you
with this giant sword."

01:00:37.387 --> 01:00:39.307
Excuse me? Sir!

01:00:39.348 --> 01:00:41.848
And then, you...

01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:43.312
You got through.

01:00:43.352 --> 01:00:45.442
I have to find LA muerte.

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:47.114
LA muerte?

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:49.858
Sorry, you missed her, Manolo.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.400
Wait! You know me?

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:54.195
Yeah, man. We know everybody.

01:00:54.238 --> 01:00:57.528
We know Luis, Carmen, and puddle.

01:00:57.574 --> 01:00:58.954
How are you doing, puddle?

01:01:00.327 --> 01:01:01.787
Hello, puddle.

01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:05.424
It's all here in the book of life.

01:01:05.457 --> 01:01:07.627
Wait, where are my manners?

01:01:07.668 --> 01:01:09.338
Come on in, y'all!

01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:13.257
Manolo and his family were the first
to ever see the magic waterfalls...

01:01:13.298 --> 01:01:15.758
That linked all the realms.

01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:19.931
Welcome to the cave of souls!

01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:25.395
Now, this is a cave!

01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:27.345
You see all these candles?

01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:29.976
Each one is a life.

01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:33.903
And I'm your humble,
yet strikingly handsome...

01:01:33.944 --> 01:01:36.244
Candle maker!

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.039
I don't get it.

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:44.327
Wait! I didn't do the thing.
I got to do the thing.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.750
Watch this.

01:01:54.506 --> 01:01:55.166
Wow!

01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:57.175
Amazing, huh?

01:01:57.217 --> 01:01:58.887
This is our work!

01:01:58.927 --> 01:02:00.847
This is what we do!

01:02:01.972 --> 01:02:05.102
Look! That group, that's your town.

01:02:05.142 --> 01:02:08.232
And there, that's Maria.

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:10.020
And next to her, Manolo.

01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:14.227
One aflame with life, the other...

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.110
Kaput.

01:02:16.612 --> 01:02:17.362
You see...

01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:19.494
As long as someone alive
remembers you...

01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:23.951
You get to live in
the land of the remembered.

01:02:24.703 --> 01:02:26.623
- Santa gordita!
- What is it?

01:02:26.663 --> 01:02:28.873
Chakal is on the march.

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:31.959
With him comes the end of your town.

01:02:32.002 --> 01:02:35.382
And there will be no one left
to remember you.

01:02:35.422 --> 01:02:36.972
We would all be forgotten.

01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:38.967
Please, candle maker.

01:02:39.009 --> 01:02:40.639
Come on, help me go back.

01:02:40.677 --> 01:02:42.547
I can't do that, Manolo.

01:02:45.933 --> 01:02:47.353
Santa chihuahua!

01:02:47.392 --> 01:02:48.642
Okay, okay.

01:02:48.685 --> 01:02:52.555
Look, guys, the book of life
holds everyone's story.

01:02:52.606 --> 01:02:54.856
But the pages on Manolo's life...

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:56.689
They're blank!

01:02:58.195 --> 01:03:01.665
You didn't live the life
that was written for you.

01:03:01.698 --> 01:03:05.408
You are writing your own story!

01:03:08.539 --> 01:03:09.659
That's good?

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:11.916
So this means
you'll help me find LA muerte?

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.010
Well, I'm not supposed to interfere,
but I may be able to bend the rules.

01:03:18.048 --> 01:03:20.008
Just a little.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:23.090
After all, it is the day of the dead.

01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:24.216
Right, book?

01:03:28.392 --> 01:03:29.772
Come on, let's do this.

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:31.060
I'll take you to LA muerte.

01:03:31.478 --> 01:03:33.608
- I'm going alone.
- Alone?

01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:34.647
- Hold on, now.
- Fine.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.360
I'm going alone, too...

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.230
Can I get a word in?

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:38.686
...right next to you.

01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:40.025
- Actually...
- we should go.

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:43.740
"We"? No!
It's much too dangerous for a lady!

01:03:43.782 --> 01:03:45.122
- No retreat!
- Hold on!

01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:47.118
No surrender!

01:03:48.287 --> 01:03:50.407
I tried to warn them.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.420
I immediately regret this decision!

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.850
Are you sure we're in the right place?

01:04:07.764 --> 01:04:11.604
You sanchezes need to look before
you go jumping into magic waterfalls.

01:04:12.019 --> 01:04:13.899
What if you jump into the wrong one?

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:15.897
You might end up in Tijuana.

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:17.729
I think I died there.

01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:21.654
Welcome to the land of the forgotten.

01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:22.855
Sad, huh?

01:04:25.532 --> 01:04:26.832
You poor things.

01:04:26.867 --> 01:04:29.287
And that's gonna happen to us
if we don't hurry.

01:04:29.786 --> 01:04:30.786
Come on.

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:37.460
There it is, xibalba's castle.

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:41.916
LA muerte!

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:43.795
I need a word with you, my lady!

01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:45.592
Manolo?

01:04:45.636 --> 01:04:47.256
But how did you get here?

01:04:47.304 --> 01:04:48.684
I had some help.

01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:50.466
Hey, there.

01:04:50.516 --> 01:04:52.766
Candle maker. Carmen!

01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:55.309
And the head of Luis?

01:04:58.857 --> 01:05:01.397
Great, my arthritis is back.

01:05:01.652 --> 01:05:03.492
I know about the wager.

01:05:03.529 --> 01:05:04.779
Xibalba cheated.

01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:06.491
- He did what?
- Yeah!

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.990
With a two-headed snake!

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.290
You might want
to cover your ears right now.

01:05:12.329 --> 01:05:16.499
Xibalba!

01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:21.376
Yes, my dear?

01:05:22.548 --> 01:05:25.548
You misbegotten son of a leprous donkey!

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:27.302
You cheated!

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:28.474
Again!

01:05:28.512 --> 01:05:30.102
I did no such thing.

01:05:31.682 --> 01:05:33.812
Oh, that.

01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:36.521
It has a mind of its own. Or two.

01:05:36.562 --> 01:05:38.902
- That is unforgivable!
- Oh, please!

01:05:38.939 --> 01:05:43.069
I never sent that snake to Maria,
and I never gave that medal to joaquin!

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:45.150
What medal?

01:05:45.195 --> 01:05:47.315
The one I never gave him.

01:05:47.364 --> 01:05:48.574
Ever. At all. Never.

01:05:48.615 --> 01:05:49.985
Who is this joaquin?

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:53.333
You gave joaquin the medal
of everlasting life?

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:54.160
Yes.

01:05:54.204 --> 01:05:57.174
"Medal of everlasting life"?

01:05:57.207 --> 01:05:59.127
Whoever wears the medal
cannot die or be injured.

01:06:02.212 --> 01:06:03.882
Please, can you help me up?

01:06:07.885 --> 01:06:09.595
Thank you.

01:06:09.636 --> 01:06:11.346
Can I get a slap, too?

01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:12.558
My son did not deserve this.

01:06:12.598 --> 01:06:14.638
Come on, I have to go back.

01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:17.601
It's only fair.

01:06:20.397 --> 01:06:22.897
Please, balby?

01:06:22.941 --> 01:06:24.031
"Balby"?

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:25.067
No. Never.

01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:27.028
- You better do this!
- No.

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:28.950
Hey, what about a wager?

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:30.659
- A wager?
- If I win...

01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:33.033
You give me my life back.

01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:34.406
You have nothing I want.

01:06:34.453 --> 01:06:35.753
But I do.

01:06:35.787 --> 01:06:39.417
If you win, xibalba,
you can rule both realms.

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:42.998
You name the task, anything you want,
and I will beat you.

01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:46.419
What? Are you afraid you might lose?

01:06:46.798 --> 01:06:48.218
What you doing, kid?

01:06:50.344 --> 01:06:51.764
Do we have a deal?

01:06:52.221 --> 01:06:54.511
We have a deal.

01:06:54.556 --> 01:06:57.426
Now, tell me, boy,
what keeps you up at night?

01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:00.099
What eats at you from the inside?

01:07:00.145 --> 01:07:03.395
What, do tell, is your worst fear?

01:07:05.859 --> 01:07:06.859
Got it.

01:07:15.953 --> 01:07:17.503
Manolo Sanchez!

01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:20.078
You will have to defeat every bull...

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:22.213
The Sanchez family ever finished!

01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:25.298
That would be thousands!

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:26.377
All...

01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:27.511
At...

01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:28.878
Once!

01:07:29.383 --> 01:07:31.093
If you complete this task...

01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:33.642
You will live again.

01:07:33.679 --> 01:07:37.269
And if you fail, you will be forgotten.

01:07:37.307 --> 01:07:38.307
Forever.

01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:40.228
This is impossible. It can't be done!

01:07:48.318 --> 01:07:49.318
You can do it!

01:07:54.575 --> 01:07:55.785
Are you two all right?

01:07:55.826 --> 01:07:58.746
Chakal is coming!
With a whole army behind him!

01:07:58.787 --> 01:08:01.037
You boys warn general posada.

01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:03.580
I will buy you some time.

01:08:05.127 --> 01:08:07.247
Who wants to go first?

01:08:13.093 --> 01:08:14.843
I hate...

01:08:14.887 --> 01:08:16.386
Bullfighters.

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.220
Then come and get some.

01:08:26.814 --> 01:08:27.685
Manolo!

01:08:27.733 --> 01:08:28.783
Get out of there!

01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:33.702
What is happening?

01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:35.198
- Carlos!
- Carmen!

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.330
Manolo! Your father is here!

01:08:38.202 --> 01:08:39.082
Papa?

01:08:39.118 --> 01:08:41.868
Chakal and his men
are at the gates of San angel!

01:09:05.395 --> 01:09:07.555
Man, this is a whole lot of bull.

01:09:10.067 --> 01:09:12.187
Maria posada...

01:09:12.236 --> 01:09:15.606
Do you take joaquin to be your husband?

01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:16.866
Yes.

01:09:16.907 --> 01:09:18.447
For San angel, I do.

01:09:18.492 --> 01:09:20.082
And joaquin...

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:22.497
Do you take Maria to be your wife?

01:09:24.413 --> 01:09:25.464
I...

01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:29.791
Chakal is here!

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:33.171
My medal. It's on my other suit.

01:09:33.215 --> 01:09:34.425
I gotta go.

01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:37.716
But joaquin is the only one
who can defeat chakal.

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:45.185
We can fight them together, papa.

01:09:55.779 --> 01:09:57.909
Get up and fight like a Sanchez!

01:09:58.782 --> 01:10:01.162
Mama? What are you doing here?

01:10:01.994 --> 01:10:03.204
Cholesterol.

01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:09.458
Everyone!

01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:11.422
Listen up!

01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:17.013
I know you're scared,
but look around you.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:19.180
- Do you know what I see?
- No.

01:10:19.219 --> 01:10:22.759
I see proud people
ready to fight for their beloved town.

01:10:22.806 --> 01:10:27.686
And I see that inside each of you
is a strength that cannot be measured.

01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:29.397
Yes...

01:10:29.438 --> 01:10:30.938
Even in you, pepe.

01:10:32.774 --> 01:10:35.074
This day of the dead
will never be forgotten!

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.530
We will teach chakal...

01:10:37.571 --> 01:10:39.611
That he's messing with the wrong town.

01:10:40.616 --> 01:10:41.736
San angel...

01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:46.583
I swear by those before us,
we will not fall!

01:10:46.622 --> 01:10:47.622
Not today.

01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:49.582
Medal!

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.005
Not ever!

01:10:51.043 --> 01:10:52.923
Now, who's with me?

01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:57.301
You are like the son I never had!

01:10:57.341 --> 01:10:58.721
But much prettier!

01:11:04.932 --> 01:11:08.392
Hey, chakal! Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:10.765
Because no one's that big, man.

01:11:11.772 --> 01:11:13.152
Where have you been?

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:14.320
Thank goodness you're...

01:11:14.358 --> 01:11:16.188
hey! Soldier boy.

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:19.404
You give me that medal.

01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:21.446
Right now!

01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:25.409
All this is about a stupid medal?

01:11:25.452 --> 01:11:26.582
Are you kidding me?

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:29.870
Not now, Maria. It's joaquin time.

01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:31.335
Joaquin!

01:11:34.753 --> 01:11:35.753
Joaquin!

01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:43.721
Hey, buddy, let's talk about this.

01:11:46.765 --> 01:11:47.965
Joaquin!

01:11:49.643 --> 01:11:50.983
Joaquin?

01:12:11.456 --> 01:12:13.116
The beast is out!

01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:15.337
Time to finish this.

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.060
Yeah!

01:12:27.097 --> 01:12:28.967
Finish him! Finish him!

01:12:37.608 --> 01:12:39.648
What is he doing?

01:13:19.274 --> 01:13:21.574
Toro, I am humbled

01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:24.072
for tonight, I understand

01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:28.202
your royal blood was never meant
to decorate this sand

01:13:29.243 --> 01:13:33.583
you've suffered great injustice
so have thousands before you

01:13:34.498 --> 01:13:36.538
I offer an apology

01:13:36.792 --> 01:13:38.882
and one long overdue

01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:45.085
I am sorry

01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:47.183
toro, I am sorry

01:13:48.095 --> 01:13:49.355
hear my song

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.770
and know I sing the truth

01:13:53.183 --> 01:13:56.143
although we were bred to fight

01:13:58.021 --> 01:14:02.611
I reach for kindness in your heart tonight

01:14:03.151 --> 01:14:05.901
and if you can forgive

01:14:06.321 --> 01:14:09.121
and if you can forgive

01:14:09.157 --> 01:14:13.577
love can truly live

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.910
and if you can forgive

01:14:15.956 --> 01:14:18.876
and if you can forgive

01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:23.214
love can truly live

01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:36.021
and if you can forgive

01:14:36.476 --> 01:14:39.016
and if you can forgive

01:14:39.813 --> 01:14:40.813
love

01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:46.571
love will truly live

01:14:50.908 --> 01:14:53.578
- he did it!
- Yes, he did.

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:55.789
Yeah. I'll give him that.

01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:58.795
But how did Manolo do this?

01:14:58.832 --> 01:14:59.922
He's a Sanchez.

01:15:02.085 --> 01:15:03.335
Xibalba had been wrong.

01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:05.959
Manolo's fear was never bullfighting.

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:09.086
I told you,
a Sanchez man never apologizes.

01:15:09.134 --> 01:15:10.134
Papa, I...

01:15:10.344 --> 01:15:13.224
but you just changed that.

01:15:13.263 --> 01:15:15.813
I should have been a better father.

01:15:15.849 --> 01:15:17.269
I am very sorry.

01:15:17.976 --> 01:15:19.056
No.

01:15:19.102 --> 01:15:21.192
You only wanted what was best for me.

01:15:21.939 --> 01:15:23.819
I'm so proud of you, son.

01:15:25.108 --> 01:15:26.778
I love you, papa.

01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:32.448
And at that moment,
Manolo conquered his greatest fear...

01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:34.451
Being himself.

01:15:34.785 --> 01:15:38.045
In accordance with the ancient rules...

01:15:38.539 --> 01:15:42.079
We give you life.

01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:44.035
Be careful up there, mijo.

01:15:54.221 --> 01:15:55.221
Please, chakal...

01:15:55.514 --> 01:15:56.774
Just don't hurt them.

01:15:56.807 --> 01:15:57.807
Yes.

01:15:57.850 --> 01:15:58.770
Yes!

01:15:58.809 --> 01:16:01.849
The medal is mine!

01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:20.496
What?

01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:24.175
Manolo?

01:16:36.555 --> 01:16:38.185
Hold this for me, amigo.

01:16:41.476 --> 01:16:44.936
So, my father tells me
you hate bullfighters.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.190
I hate everybody.

01:16:48.817 --> 01:16:50.317
Yeah. Yeah, mang.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.030
Okay. Let's do this.

01:16:53.363 --> 01:16:55.663
You and what army?

01:17:10.047 --> 01:17:11.877
It's the day of the dead, Manolo.

01:17:12.216 --> 01:17:16.046
And on our day,
we have a certain amount of...

01:17:16.094 --> 01:17:17.394
Leeway.

01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:18.349
Good luck!

01:17:18.388 --> 01:17:20.058
Thank you!

01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:24.555
No retreat.

01:17:24.603 --> 01:17:25.733
No surrender!

01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:28.731
He gonna do it now!

01:18:02.766 --> 01:18:04.636
We should get that guy for the band.

01:18:06.436 --> 01:18:07.896
Now, is your turn!

01:18:07.938 --> 01:18:10.068
Okay, I sing good, too.

01:18:13.819 --> 01:18:16.779
I was like,
"I think you look good. I like your hair."

01:18:16.822 --> 01:18:18.282
And he was like, "I like your hair."

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.080
Are you wearing my boots?

01:18:20.117 --> 01:18:21.737
They look better on me.

01:18:21.785 --> 01:18:22.985
Come here, lover boy!

01:18:34.298 --> 01:18:35.468
Medal!

01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:40.639
Thank you

01:18:51.607 --> 01:18:52.607
hold me!

01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:55.530
Chakal!

01:18:55.569 --> 01:18:56.899
We found the medal!

01:18:57.529 --> 01:18:59.699
My comrades.

01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:01.408
Unleash the fury!

01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:02.450
?????

01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:08.082
I'm done playing!

01:19:08.123 --> 01:19:09.963
I got it. I got this.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.250
No, no, no! I got this!

01:19:15.005 --> 01:19:17.255
Did I tell you I also studied kung fu?

01:19:17.299 --> 01:19:18.469
- Enough!
- Look out!

01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:24.644
Let go of me!

01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:27.891
Get me my medal, or your woman will pay!

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:29.645
Men. Typical!

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:31.727
Go find the medal.

01:19:31.772 --> 01:19:32.772
But Maria...

01:19:32.814 --> 01:19:34.824
Find the medal.

01:19:34.858 --> 01:19:35.978
I'll handle this.

01:19:37.528 --> 01:19:38.948
Got it. Joaquin!

01:19:55.295 --> 01:19:57.205
I save you, little Sanchez!

01:19:59.633 --> 01:20:00.633
Good luck, Manolo!

01:20:01.385 --> 01:20:03.475
Kick his butt, grandson.

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:07.810
Where do you think you're going?

01:20:08.058 --> 01:20:09.678
I have to get up there!

01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:11.266
I was right!

01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:14.361
You have become
the greatest Sanchez ever!

01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:35.959
Care to dance, señorita?

01:20:36.003 --> 01:20:37.383
I thought you'd never ask.

01:20:54.897 --> 01:20:56.517
Pretty good, guitarrista.

01:20:56.565 --> 01:20:58.445
Now it's your turn!

01:21:02.529 --> 01:21:03.529
Watch out, sisters!

01:21:03.739 --> 01:21:05.119
Save yourselves!

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:12.160
Hi, Maria!

01:21:12.206 --> 01:21:13.246
Hi!

01:21:22.633 --> 01:21:26.143
I'm taking this whole town with me!

01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:34.603
No more shadows, dad.

01:21:34.645 --> 01:21:36.065
No retreat?

01:21:36.897 --> 01:21:38.227
No surrender.

01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:46.658
- Manolo, the column!
- I got it.

01:21:47.115 --> 01:21:48.945
No. No!

01:21:48.992 --> 01:21:49.992
Hey!

01:21:51.578 --> 01:21:53.288
Don't stop fighting for what's right.

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:54.500
Wait, what?

01:21:55.749 --> 01:21:56.749
Manolo!

01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:58.495
Adios, brother.

01:21:58.961 --> 01:22:00.341
What is he doing?

01:22:07.177 --> 01:22:08.677
Don't forget me.

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.180
No!

01:22:19.857 --> 01:22:21.817
Chakal is defeated!

01:22:21.859 --> 01:22:23.319
Retreat!

01:22:37.124 --> 01:22:38.124
Manolo?

01:22:43.547 --> 01:22:45.337
It's me, mi Amor.

01:22:46.008 --> 01:22:49.088
But how did you survive?

01:22:49.136 --> 01:22:51.046
Don't look at me.

01:22:53.724 --> 01:22:54.854
Joaquin.

01:22:55.475 --> 01:22:57.765
You gave me the medal.

01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:00.481
You were going to sacrifice yourself...

01:23:00.522 --> 01:23:01.732
For me.

01:23:02.733 --> 01:23:05.113
I thought it might be time...

01:23:05.152 --> 01:23:08.072
To be a true hero.
Like you, Manolo.

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:09.910
Are you all right?

01:23:13.493 --> 01:23:16.163
I have never seen more clearly.

01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:22.093
It's time to cast our own shadows.

01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:25.419
And write our own stories.

01:23:26.006 --> 01:23:30.136
And so, joaquin learned
that to be a true hero...

01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:32.257
You have to be selfless.

01:23:35.557 --> 01:23:38.227
There is one more thing we need to do...

01:23:38.936 --> 01:23:40.436
Son.

01:23:41.605 --> 01:23:44.655
Do you take Manolo as your husband?

01:23:44.691 --> 01:23:45.691
I do.

01:23:46.193 --> 01:23:49.993
By the power vested in us
by the book of life...

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:53.490
We now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:23:53.534 --> 01:23:54.534
You may kiss...

01:23:55.452 --> 01:23:56.912
The groom?

01:23:57.538 --> 01:24:00.118
She is gonna be a great Sanchez.

01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:04.252
And today was a good day...

01:24:04.294 --> 01:24:05.634
Of the dead.

01:24:06.797 --> 01:24:08.167
Well...

01:24:08.215 --> 01:24:10.435
I believe you've won the wager, mi Amor.

01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:13.927
Along with my heart, all over again.

01:24:13.971 --> 01:24:15.811
Balby.

01:24:16.265 --> 01:24:18.525
I'm so sorry, my love.

01:24:18.559 --> 01:24:21.689
You deserve better than me.
I know that now.

01:24:21.728 --> 01:24:23.768
Will you ever forgive me?

01:24:24.231 --> 01:24:25.481
I do.

01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:33.911
Husband, how about a song?

01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:36.829
As you wish, Mrs. Sanchez.

01:24:37.327 --> 01:24:40.957
I will stay by you...

01:24:40.998 --> 01:24:42.668
Even when we fall

01:24:44.668 --> 01:24:48.088
I will be the rock that holds you up
and lifts you high...

01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:50.010
So you stand tall

01:24:52.593 --> 01:24:54.643
and I won't let you fall

01:24:56.513 --> 01:24:58.473
I won't let you...

01:24:58.515 --> 01:25:00.095
Go

01:25:01.727 --> 01:25:04.767
no matter where you are
no matter where you are

01:25:04.813 --> 01:25:06.693
I'll be there

01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:12.146
no matter where you are
no matter where you are

01:25:12.196 --> 01:25:14.026
I'll be there

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:21.500
so tear apart these giant hearts
that beat inside us now

01:25:23.373 --> 01:25:27.543
let's give ourselves our promises
of our unending...

01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:30.553
Love

01:25:32.716 --> 01:25:34.676
and I won't let you fall

01:25:34.718 --> 01:25:36.638
I won't let you fall

01:25:36.678 --> 01:25:38.848
I won't let you go

01:25:38.889 --> 01:25:41.059
I won't let you go

01:25:41.767 --> 01:25:44.847
no matter where you are
no matter where you are

01:25:44.895 --> 01:25:46.655
I'll be there

01:25:46.688 --> 01:25:48.978
I will be there

01:25:49.024 --> 01:25:50.824
no matter where you are

01:25:50.859 --> 01:25:52.239
no matter where you are

01:25:52.277 --> 01:25:53.737
I'll be there

01:25:53.779 --> 01:25:56.359
I will be there

01:25:56.406 --> 01:25:59.406
no matter where you are
no matter where you are

01:25:59.451 --> 01:26:01.541
I'll be there

01:26:06.792 --> 01:26:08.882
I'll be there

01:26:10.921 --> 01:26:12.841
and the world keeps spinning...

01:26:12.881 --> 01:26:14.921
And the tales keep turning...

01:26:14.967 --> 01:26:17.717
And people come,
and people go...

01:26:17.761 --> 01:26:19.721
But they are never forgotten.

01:26:19.763 --> 01:26:23.563
And the one truth we know,
it held true one more time...

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.230
That love, true love...

01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:29.270
The really, really good kind of love...

01:26:29.898 --> 01:26:31.518
Never dies.

01:26:31.567 --> 01:26:34.237
Caramba, it gets me every time.

01:26:34.278 --> 01:26:36.278
Okay, kids, closing time.

01:26:37.614 --> 01:26:39.294
Your bus should be outside
waiting for you.

01:26:41.618 --> 01:26:43.448
Adios, pretty lady!

01:26:44.288 --> 01:26:46.078
Adios, Sasha!

01:26:46.123 --> 01:26:47.793
LA muerte?

01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:50.631
LA muerte!

01:26:51.962 --> 01:26:53.592
You never cease to amaze me...

01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:55.090
Mi Amor. Such passion.

01:26:55.132 --> 01:26:56.632
Anyone can die.

01:26:56.675 --> 01:27:00.255
These kids,
they will have the courage to live.

01:27:00.304 --> 01:27:02.934
I'll wager you are right, my love.

01:27:08.604 --> 01:27:11.694
