WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.999
(siren wailing)

00:03.045 --> 00:04.455
(woman on radio)
McNally, what's your 20?

00:04.505 --> 00:06.791
Suspect just entered the alley
behind Wyndham.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.829
(man on radio)
Where is he headed, McNally?

00:07.883 --> 00:09.794
(siren wailing)
Heading west.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.003
Police! Stop!

00:11.053 --> 00:12.714
We'll cut him off at Fundy.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.054
(grunts)

00:16.099 --> 00:19.341
He wrenched the earth
of a broken soul, disembodied.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.770
Sir, just relax.
I'm not trying to hurt you.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.677
- A shell of a person...
- Sir, drop the weapon.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.811
And with his mighty blade,
he silences the world...

00:23.857 --> 00:24.972
- No.
- And sets himself...

00:25.025 --> 00:27.482
(taser crackles)
(man grunts)

00:29.530 --> 00:31.020
(Oliver) Nice shot, Sammy.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.530
(Sam) Third one this week.
Gotta be the heat.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.032
Yeah, I keep telling you,
it's not the heat. It's the insanity.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.864
I'm okay. Thank you.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.153
- He's clean.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.993
All right, well, the overwhelming smell of urine
would seem to contradict that,

00:42.042 --> 00:44.283
but, Galahad, let's get you
back to the castle.

00:44.336 --> 00:47.123
One, two, three. (grunts)

00:47.172 --> 00:51.506
And on three again.
Three. (grunts)

00:51.552 --> 00:53.668
(man moans)

00:53.720 --> 00:55.836
(Oliver) Dispatch, 1519.
We've got the...

00:55.889 --> 00:56.878
He was coming at you pretty hard.

00:56.932 --> 00:57.921
Yeah.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.636
Why didn't you draw your gun?

00:59.685 --> 01:01.516
I don't know.
I guess I just thought that--

01:01.562 --> 01:02.893
- Don't.
- Don't what?

01:02.938 --> 01:04.974
Don't overthink it, okay?
That feeling in your gut,

01:05.023 --> 01:06.229
you gotta learn to listen to it.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.186
It's telling you what you need to do.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.226
You gotta learn to trust it.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.611
- Okay.
- All right?

01:14.491 --> 01:15.526
You all right?

01:17.369 --> 01:21.328
(police radio chatter)

01:21.373 --> 01:23.079
(horns honk)

01:23.125 --> 01:24.615
(drums beating)

01:24.668 --> 01:26.283
How the hell did you sleep through that?

01:26.336 --> 01:27.997
Sleep through what?

01:28.046 --> 01:31.254
See? This is what I'm talking about.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.585
This.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.804
Hey, Dale! Dale!

01:39.850 --> 01:42.592
Oh, hey, officer...s.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.977
You blocked me in again, man.
I need you to move your truck.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.273
Uh... dude, I'm in no condition.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.605
Okay, well, that's fine. Just--
Look, just give me your keys,

01:52.654 --> 01:53.689
and I'll move it for you.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.905
Right. Keys...

01:56.950 --> 01:58.781
are...

01:58.827 --> 02:01.819
(drumming continues)

02:06.752 --> 02:07.958
(Oliver) All right, settle, settle.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.959
Day 7 of a 7-day stretch.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.745
It was record temperatures this week,

02:11.798 --> 02:13.789
and the good news is
it's gonna be even hotter today.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.127
(all groan)

02:15.177 --> 02:17.008
(Oliver) I know, I know.
We're all running on empty.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.921
But I do have three critical words of advice
for the rookies--

02:19.973 --> 02:21.349
suck it up, folks.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.723
(Noelle) EMS is overwhelmed,
so we're pitching in where we can.

02:23.769 --> 02:27.057
And remember, we gotta stay visible
so the bad guys know we're out there.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.221
This kind of heat, people aren't themselves,

02:29.274 --> 02:30.935
but it's ourjob to keep our cool.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.145
That's right. It's a good thing that some of us
are just born that way.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.106
(laughs, then stops short)

02:35.155 --> 02:37.111
All right, people, it's our last shift.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.193
Ten more hours,
and we all get our lives back.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.948
Till then, they belong to the city.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.326
That's right, so serve, protect
and whatever.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.532
Go the hell home.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.952
(murmuring)

02:48.001 --> 02:49.912
Ten more hours?
I cannot tell you how much

02:49.961 --> 02:51.826
I'm looking forward
to peeling off this uniform.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.620
And then may I suggest
a group bubble bath--

02:53.674 --> 02:55.380
you know, conserve water,
save the planet.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.586
Next couple days,
it's just me and my little guy--

02:57.636 --> 02:58.625
whatever he wants.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.794
Yeah, well, | just can't wait

02:59.846 --> 03:01.177
to get a few days away from Swarek.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.714
He's made me ride shotgun
every day this week.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.849
You know, everything I do is wrong.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.930
- It's like he doesn't trust me.
- You're a great cop.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.594
lf Swarek doesn't trust you, he's an idiot.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.855
Well, I think he knows exactly what he's doing.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.310
Think about it. He spends all day

03:13.360 --> 03:15.646
with a relatively attractive young woman

03:15.696 --> 03:19.234
who hangs on his every word,
files his reports, makes his coffee.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.488
I mean, why would he give that up?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.991
You're like his hot secretary with a gun.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.822
Man-boy actually has a point.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.077
Hey, at least he likes you.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.704
I gotta spend the next ten hours with Gail.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.705
Now there's a cop
who needs to lighten up.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.287
Mm. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.329
Cameras.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.372
There's no cameras in here.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.758
Mm. (muffled) I'm pretty sure--

03:39.803 --> 03:41.043
(normal voice) I'm pretty sure

03:41.096 --> 03:42.632
we're not supposed to be doing this right now.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.716
Oh, my God. Please don't tell me

03:43.765 --> 03:45.426
you're thinking about protocol right now.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.057
Mm. Mm. No, no.

03:48.103 --> 03:51.345
It's just that I haven't got
a full night's sleep in three days,

03:51.398 --> 03:52.433
and my neighbor's an idiot,

03:52.482 --> 03:53.767
and I had to ride the bus

03:53.817 --> 03:55.478
- What...
- to work today.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.269
is... your point?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.061
(whispers) Do you think...

04:00.115 --> 04:02.231
No, no, no.
Just--Just not at work.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.524
Okay?

04:05.620 --> 04:07.997
Fine.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.324
No. Good day, officer.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.615
No, Gail. No--

04:11.668 --> 04:12.999
Whatever.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.590
Oh, that's what you look like.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.376
Could've sworn you had longer sideburns.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.091
I could've sworn you were a redhead.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.426
Sorry I didn't make it by last night.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.932
IDENT went long on the Lakeshore stabbings.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.342
I decided to stay and finish it up.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.260
- Ah, your loss.
- Really?

04:32.314 --> 04:34.851
Yeah, 'cause last night
included me with ice cream...

04:34.900 --> 04:35.889
(whispers) naked.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.933
lnthatcase”.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.146
(Sam, amplified voice) McNally.
(horn honks)

04:39.196 --> 04:40.276
(normal voice)
Okay, so I'll see you tonight?

04:40.322 --> 04:41.778
- Count on it.
- Great.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.063
(siren whoops)

04:47.120 --> 04:48.451
(police radio chatter)

04:48.497 --> 04:49.486
Ugh.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.120
It's true. You look tired.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.781
Charming.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.120
Hey, some guys think, uh, dark circles

04:55.170 --> 04:57.252
give a woman's face character.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.958
Callaghan doesn't seem to mind.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.793
Yeah, well, he spends
more time with dead people,

05:00.842 --> 05:03.254
so it's really not that hard to impress him.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.673
Hard to get your downtime in sync?

05:07.516 --> 05:08.847
Yeah, well, you know,
it's not a big deal.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.929
It's only been a couple weeks.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.435
A working detective's
kind of like undercover.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.312
You know,
you always got an open case,

05:16.358 --> 05:17.894
get pretty wrapped up,

05:17.943 --> 05:19.729
lose sight of what's right in front of you.

05:21.696 --> 05:22.731
(brakes skid)
Whoa!

05:22.781 --> 05:24.737
(tires skidding)

05:24.783 --> 05:26.739
(ice cream truck music playing)

05:26.785 --> 05:28.116
(siren whoops)

05:28.161 --> 05:29.150
This is 1505,

05:29.204 --> 05:32.662
um, eastbound on Queen and Sumach.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.995
Uh, we're in pursuit of an...
ice cream truck.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.659
(woman on radio)
You're in pursuit of what?

05:37.712 --> 05:38.747
It's a white, uh...

05:38.797 --> 05:40.162
(siren whoops)
Mr. Delightful truck.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.500
It has bells on it.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.666
(Sam, amplified voice)
Police. Pull over.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.254
(tires skidding)

05:52.561 --> 05:54.927
(ice cream truck music continues)

05:57.941 --> 05:58.930
Hey! Get your hands up!

05:58.984 --> 06:00.645
- Wasn't me!
- Get your hands up!

06:00.694 --> 06:01.934
- Get out of the car! Get out!
- Get out of the truck, sir!

06:01.987 --> 06:03.193
- Okay. I wasn't...
- Out of the truck.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.853
- Get on the ground.
- I wasn't even driving!

06:04.906 --> 06:06.237
(Andy) Shut up! Turn around.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.284
- 1505.
- Spread your legs.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.366
I need an ambulance--
Queen and Logan.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.496
Breaking the glass.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.416
Aah!

06:22.465 --> 06:24.842
Hey, you okay?

06:33.977 --> 06:36.684
Come on, sweetie.
Come on, sweetie.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.141
(woman on radio)
1505, EMS is on its way to Queen and Logan.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.483
(police radio chatter)

06:53.079 --> 06:54.285
(Sam) Well, she's shaken up,

06:54.331 --> 06:55.867
but, uh, the medics say
she's gonna be okay.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.747
She's fine, you know?

06:57.792 --> 06:58.952
Yeah, what about you?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.921
I don't mean to sound like your mother,
but I think you need stitches.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.670
Eh, it's okay. It's fine.
It's fine. It's fine.

07:04.716 --> 07:08.425
Let's see this. Dhara Singh--13.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.711
Why is a 13-year-old
driving an ice cream truck?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.755
I told you, l have no idea, okay?

07:12.807 --> 07:14.217
l was over at Garrison Park.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.098
I closed for ten minutes to restock.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.011
Next thing I know,
bam, the truck takes off.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.099
What, you kept it running?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.935
Yeah. So?
Look, | start it in the morning.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.600
It goes all day, okay?

07:25.654 --> 07:28.942
Whoa. I'm the victim here, remember?

07:28.990 --> 07:30.275
You know how much money
I'm gonna lose?

07:30.325 --> 07:31.440
These things are 6 bucks each.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.824
6 bucks?

07:32.869 --> 07:33.984
lt's heat wave prices, okay?

07:34.037 --> 07:35.618
This is a business, okay?

07:35.664 --> 07:37.404
Now I want that little bitch arrested.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.037
(chuckles)

07:41.086 --> 07:43.748
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
take some of these as evidence.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.786
McNally?

07:44.839 --> 07:47.125
Yeah, evidence, absolutely.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.336
You better get some full ones there.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.466
Yeah.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.877
- I'm an idiot?
- Yeah, you're an idiot!

07:51.930 --> 07:53.261
You're the one behind the wheel!
Pay attention!

07:53.306 --> 07:54.341
(Noelle) shut up!

07:58.311 --> 08:01.144
Body A took Body B's cab across town,
then refused to pay.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.269
Body B didn't like that so much.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.771
Uh, who threw the first punch?

08:03.817 --> 08:06.103
They both say it was the other guy.
That's as far as I got.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.143
Enjoy.
(door beeps, buzzes)

08:08.196 --> 08:10.608
Look, come on.
I got a plane to catch.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.490
Yeah, well, you should have thought
about that before going five rounds.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.275
l was defending myself.
This guy's crazy.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.785
This man is a thief.
I want to press charges.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.992
I took him halfway across town.
He won't pay.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.329
Calm down, everybody, please.
I'm gonna need both your names.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.959
Look, I'm the one who should be
pressing charges, okay?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.336
This guy had no idea
where he was going.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.496
You said airport.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.039
- I said Island Airport.
- No, you didn't!

08:29.092 --> 08:31.253
How would you know? You were
on the damn phone the whole time!

08:31.302 --> 08:33.793
- What does that even matter?!
- Just shut up, guys!

08:33.847 --> 08:35.838
Man, look, why don't we put
both of you in a cell,

08:35.890 --> 08:37.721
and you guys can figure it out
on your own, huh?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.634
Two men enter. One man leaves.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.429
Okay, let's try this again.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.642
Names, one at a time.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.182
(man) I did this with the lady
in the car already.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.396
Ugh! This is so lame.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.607
What are you talkin' about?

08:51.656 --> 08:55.023
Ladies, don't forget to stay hydrated.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.065
Thanks.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.859
And supple and delicious.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.994
What are you, 12?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.622
Uh, no. I enjoy myjob.
We're guardians of public safety

09:02.667 --> 09:04.703
- in a time of crisis. Water?
- Thank you.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.618
No, Dov, we're actually handing out
refreshments to people

09:06.671 --> 09:09.413
who aren't smart enough
to realize that they're thirsty.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.831
You know, negative, negative.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.465
Uh, red brick house up the street--

09:12.510 --> 09:13.841
I don't know what the hell's happening,

09:13.887 --> 09:16.378
but I think somebody's in trouble.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.671
Let's go.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.759
(shuts trunk)

09:24.814 --> 09:29.103
(woman screams)

09:31.446 --> 09:32.686
Police! Open the door.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.481
(dish shatters)
(woman screams)

09:36.326 --> 09:38.408
(woman gasping)
(shards clatter)

09:38.453 --> 09:41.240
It's okay, really.
I just dropped my salad.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.281
Is everything all right?

09:44.334 --> 09:48.577
(screams loudly)

09:49.547 --> 09:50.753
I'm gonna take that as a no.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.040
(moans)

09:53.093 --> 09:55.084
(indistinct conversations,
police radio chatter)

09:59.599 --> 10:00.759
(man) This must be a mistake.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.266
Dhara would never steal
an ice cream truck.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.097
She--She's not even
allowed to eat ice cream.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.977
Sir, we found her behind the wheel.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.098
Well, who put you up to it?

10:10.151 --> 10:12.107
It was that little fat girl, wasn't it?

10:12.153 --> 10:15.987
The one whose mom lets her
put the piercings in her ears.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.488
No, it wasn't.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.614
So who was it?

10:20.912 --> 10:22.448
Dhara, please.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.829
Just tell the police officers what happened.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.830
I don't know. I don't remember.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.041
Sweetie, what about your feet?

10:37.095 --> 10:39.086
Do you remember
how you got tar on them?

10:41.432 --> 10:43.684
Mr. Singh,
maybe your wife has some idea?

10:43.726 --> 10:45.717
My wife is gone.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.011
It's just the two of us.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.152
Do we seriously have to charge her?

10:56.197 --> 10:58.939
What? The kid went joyriding
and damaged public property.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.027
We don't have a choice.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.486
No, it doesn't make any sense.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.901
Why? You know her?

11:02.954 --> 11:05.070
Latchkey kid, single dad
who works too many hours?

11:05.123 --> 11:06.579
Yeah, I kind of do know her.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.125
Oh. So you never rebelled?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.580
Yeah, of course I rebelled.
I put on too much eye makeup

11:10.628 --> 11:12.209
or maybe made out with the wrong guy.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.337
I never stole an ice cream truck.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.168
Come on. Let's just go back
to Garrison Park

11:16.217 --> 11:18.458
and, you know,
see if anybody saw anything.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.172
It's a minor charge
on a very busy day.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.677
We just don't have the time, okay?

11:21.723 --> 11:22.929
Sam.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.966
Hey, Monica.
W-What are you doing here?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.134
How are--How are you?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.185
Uh, AC's out in lockup.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.266
Now you've got six
law-abiding citizens in there

11:31.316 --> 11:32.681
complaining of chest pains.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.191
They called me over from St. Mike's
to see which ones are legit.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.737
Good.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.978
Hi. Monica.

11:39.741 --> 11:40.730
Andy.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.035
That's McNally, my, uh, new rookie.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.066
Right.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.076
What happened to your hand?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.237
Oh, it's f--|t's nothing.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.279
- It's fine.
- Let me see.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.869
Oh, it's...

11:49.918 --> 11:51.579
No, this is deep. You need stitches.

11:51.628 --> 11:52.663
That's what I said.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.044
(woman)
Can we get an RN to cells, please?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.705
Sorry. I've gotta go give nitro
to some lard-ass.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.045
- Give me ten minutes.
- Yeah.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.426
Actually, we're just on our way
to interview some witnesses

12:02.472 --> 12:03.882
at Garrison Park, so--

12:03.932 --> 12:06.264
- Wasn't asking.
- Okay.

12:06.309 --> 12:11.019
(scoffs) So about those witnesses
that we're gonna go interview,

12:11.064 --> 12:12.179
you know, I'm good to go on my own.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.389
- Shaw!
- Yeah?

12:15.443 --> 12:17.900
Are you free to take McNally
over to Garrison Park?

12:17.946 --> 12:19.937
Well, what's in it for me?

12:19.989 --> 12:23.573
Uh, she'll do the paperwork
for your last five shifts.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.653
She's pretty good.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.737
Five shifts, huh?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.072
- Yeah.
- Lot of paperwork.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.248
- Yeah, I'll take a ride.
- All righty. Good to go.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.450
All right. Thank you, Sammy.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.580
(opens can)

12:35.129 --> 12:37.120
lt's false labor.
I'm not due for another month.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.791
Well, do you have a husband
or... a partner?

12:41.177 --> 12:43.884
l have a husband--Eric.
He's in New York.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.091
But it's okay, because
he's coming back tonight.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.222
Well, it might be a good idea
to just see your doctor

12:48.268 --> 12:49.257
just to be sure.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.641
Okay. I'm gonna do that.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.723
You get your groceries delivered?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.434
That is so cool, you know?
I was thinking about doing that,

12:55.483 --> 12:57.815
but I kind of like to pick out
my own produce--you know,

12:57.860 --> 12:59.896
tap the, uh, melons.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.811
- I don't eat melon.
- Okay.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.116
ljust--l have so much work
I want to do

13:04.158 --> 13:07.321
on the baby's room, and |--
(gasping) So if you could just--

13:07.370 --> 13:08.485
- Aah!
- Okay, okay.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.653
Uh, we're gonna get you an ambulance.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.867
No! No ambulance! I'm fine.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.292
That is not fine.

13:13.334 --> 13:17.202
Oh, God. My water broke.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.672
(horns honking in distance)
(Andy sighs)

13:21.718 --> 13:23.333
Whoa, hey, don't. Don't.

13:23.386 --> 13:26.423
Until they make vests that breathe,
that AC is staying on full blast.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.428
Full blast?

13:31.728 --> 13:33.184
You know, in case
you hadn't noticed, McNally,

13:33.229 --> 13:34.639
most people are pretty stupid,

13:34.689 --> 13:36.645
you know, and this heat
just makes 'em crazy.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.933
Stupid and crazy, that's just--
that's a bad combination.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.351
Little bit of rain,
everything's gonna go b--

13:41.404 --> 13:42.519
Don't.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.187
- What? I was just gonna say everything's...
- Uhh!

13:44.240 --> 13:45.229
gonna go back to normal.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.148
(woman on radio)
We've got a 911 call for shots fired

13:47.201 --> 13:49.692
at 85 Clifford Court.
Shots fired.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.954
Dispatch, Mark 1519 responding.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.081
Thanks, McNally. You're a peach.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.208
(siren wailing)

13:59.756 --> 14:03.544
(woman on radio)
Caller is Michelle lv-res, or l-vres.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.584
She lives in apartment 212.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.503
(Oliver) Dispatch,
1519 on-scene, 85 Clifford Court.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.547
- Responding to shots fired.
- Copy.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.433
Man, I hate coming here.
(seat belts unclick)

14:14.062 --> 14:16.348
(woman on radio)
Backup units, what's your ETA?

14:16.397 --> 14:17.807
(man on radio) 1511 at Pacific.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.143
(woman on radio)
1507. We're at Worth and...

14:20.985 --> 14:22.521
Okay, eyes up, McNally. Eyes up.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.152
You never know what's gonna
come out of these windows.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.816
You do realize this is your fault?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.072
ldidn'tjinx us.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.368
Yeah, honestly,
you're not making it any better.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.399
(woman) Please!

14:30.453 --> 14:31.613
Stop!

14:31.662 --> 14:33.744
No, you--you gotta help me.
It's my daughter.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.825
Your daughter's been shot?

14:34.874 --> 14:35.954
No, she's gone.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.036
She was supposed to be back by now.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.371
There were no gunshots?

14:39.420 --> 14:40.921
No. It's Aisha. She's missing.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.794
Let me get this straight.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.707
You reported gunshots
because you can't find your daughter.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.375
I didn't know what else to do.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.134
I mean, you cops
never come up to these projects

14:49.180 --> 14:50.636
- unless you have to.
- (crying)

14:50.681 --> 14:53.844
Dispatch, this is Shaw 1519.
Disregard shots fired.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.882
Cancel all other units.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.767
Please. You--
You have to help me.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.769
- How old is your daughter?
- 13.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.180
How long has she been gone?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.769
Um, about an hour and a half.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.732
This is Officer McNally.
She'll take your information,

15:06.781 --> 15:08.442
and we'll see what we can do.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.573
Please don't make that call again.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.028
- My waterjust broke, so if...
- 915 Euclid.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.238
- you could call me back...
- As soon as you can, please.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.367
- as soon as you get this?
- Thank you.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.654
(lowers voice)
Ambulances are backed up

15:16.707 --> 15:18.038
at least a half an hour, maybe more.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.075
Oh, look, I don't need an ambulance, okay?

15:20.128 --> 15:21.334
Eric and l were having a home birth.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.960
| just left a message for my midwife,

15:23.005 --> 15:24.586
and now I'm calling my doula.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.917
(lowers voice)
What is a doula?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.298
Birth coach for hippies.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.459
I thought a birth coach
was a birth coach for hippies.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.800
Aah! She's not in, either.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.089
I'll go get the cruiser.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.882
(normal voice) Anna,
do you have an overnight bag?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.175
But babies born at home
come into the world

15:37.228 --> 15:38.468
in a much less stressful environment.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.604
My doula is actually
my yoga instructor! Aah!

15:41.649 --> 15:43.981
Just please listen.
You have to let me--

15:44.026 --> 15:45.937
- No! Stay away from me.
- Anna, please!

15:45.987 --> 15:47.397
Gail, Gail, can I talk to you
for a second?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.109
(lowers voice) We can't let
some stupid hippie endanger her baby

15:50.158 --> 15:51.398
just 'cause she doesn't
want to leave the house.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.861
It's not that she doesn't want to.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.992
I don't think she can.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.368
(moans)

15:56.414 --> 15:58.325
Anna.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.581
(exhaling deeply)

16:00.626 --> 16:01.877
Anna...

16:03.504 --> 16:05.665
How long has it been
since you left the house?

16:08.509 --> 16:09.498
(Andy) You've checked
the neighborhood?

16:09.552 --> 16:12.294
I've looked everywhere, but I got Kiara,

16:12.346 --> 16:14.052
and--and with this heat,
I had to come back

16:14.098 --> 16:15.178
in case she came home.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.010
Okay, well, it's only been a while.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.469
Maybe she's just out
with some friends or something.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.384
Aisha doesn't have a lot of friends.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.555
She's quiet, you know? Real shy.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.599
She wouldn't go nowhere
without telling me.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.936
Okay. You last saw her this morning?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.398
She begged me to go,
but Kiara's been sick,

16:29.447 --> 16:30.562
and with this heat, you know--

16:30.615 --> 16:32.355
I mean, it's just a few blocks away.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.273
- No, where did she want to go?
- Garrison Park,

16:34.327 --> 16:35.863
the one with the spray fountain.

16:35.912 --> 16:36.901
Yeah.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.499
You don't think there's any chance
that she ran away?

16:40.541 --> 16:44.159
Cops always say that when girls
go missing from this neighborhood.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.454
No. I know my little girl
did not run away.

16:48.799 --> 16:49.925
Okay.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.541
Name?

16:53.721 --> 16:56.463
- She asked you a question.
- L-Train.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.848
Your real name,
the one mama gave you.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.100
|.D. says Trainoff, Linus.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.512
(chuckles) Linus?
I guess mama didn't like you very much.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.680
Hmm.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.848
It says you were caught

17:06.901 --> 17:09.017
stealing air conditioners
from Camden Towers.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.150
So?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.983
So that's a seniors residence.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.533
If they don't want people taking them,

17:14.575 --> 17:16.281
then they shouldn't be
stickin' 'em out the windows.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.363
- Oh, you think that's funny, huh?
- A bit.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.664
This kind of heat,
those people could have died.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.037
What the hell's the matter with you?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.072
What if that was your grandma,

17:23.125 --> 17:24.535
- huh, Linus?
- Ain't no thing.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.701
Oh, it ain't no thing, huh?
How about we lock you

17:26.754 --> 17:29.496
in a hot box with no air
and see how you do, huh?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.914
You probably wouldn't find it that nice.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.457
You'd probably find it a little hard
to breathe, huh?

17:32.510 --> 17:33.499
Officer Diaz.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.542
(Linus grunts)

17:34.595 --> 17:36.051
Can I see you a minute?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.840
(gaSDS)

17:40.893 --> 17:42.884
(door beeps, buzzes)

17:45.815 --> 17:48.056
Okay, listen, you gotta chill out.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.189
Do you want to get written up?

17:49.235 --> 17:51.396
No. I'm sorry, okay?

17:51.445 --> 17:53.436
| just don't want to be here.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.445
Well, none of us want
to be here right now,

17:55.491 --> 17:57.402
but that's not the point.
You can't do that.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.943
No, I don't mean here at work.
I mean here in the city.

18:00.997 --> 18:04.239
Look, it's just like nobody
gives a crap about anybody.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.749
Everybody's all about themselves
all the time,

18:06.794 --> 18:09.080
andljust”

18:09.130 --> 18:11.086
| just don't want
to be one of those people.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.213
That's not gonna happen.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.248
You sure?

18:14.302 --> 18:17.965
Because right now this whole city...

18:20.349 --> 18:21.930
just doesn't feel right.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.097
It started about, um, six years ago

18:30.693 --> 18:34.185
with crowded places, mostly--
um, the mall, grocery stores.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.445
| just couldn't breathe.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.321
It was like there was
an elephant on my chest.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.696
Okay. I could see why
you'd want to avoid that.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.907
Normally I'm fine with medication,

18:43.956 --> 18:46.914
but I stopped taking all of that
about a year and a half ago

18:46.959 --> 18:49.575
when we started trying for the baby.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.996
That is a long time to be inside.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.832
(voice breaking)
I know. It sounds crazy.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.298
No. No, no.
It's a scary place out there.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.303
I totally get it.
Some mornings,

19:01.349 --> 19:02.759
I don't even want to get out of bed.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.639
Then again, I am kind of lazy.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.970
Ohh!

19:06.020 --> 19:08.978
Uh, okay. Uh, Officer Peck?

19:09.023 --> 19:10.354
Look, what?

19:10.399 --> 19:11.935
- Gail.
- Look, hey, listen.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.599
I can't get through to EMS, okay?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.109
There's still no sign of them.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.611
Go out to the cruiser.
Get the first-aid kit.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.897
(lowers voice) Why?

19:18.949 --> 19:20.735
(lowers voice)
I'm gonna get 911 on the phone.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.117
They're gonna talk us through
how to deliver a baby. Go.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.027
(Anna screams loudly)

19:25.790 --> 19:28.281
Strange to have you waiting on me
for a change.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.949
(inhales sharply)

19:30.002 --> 19:32.789
(chuckles) Are you sure
you've done this before?

19:32.838 --> 19:37.298
You know, I kind of like this.
Like I've got you on a string.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.672
I thought you said
you didn't want strings.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.759
Sam, you're a cop.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.719
You're supposed to be able
to tell when people are lying.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.056
Is it your new rookie?
She is pretty.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.563
No, I'm just her training officer,
that's all.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.520
How did you last so long undercover?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.187
Sam, I'm a big girl.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.652
Don't lead me on
if you're really into someone else.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.829
We're done.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.373
Your hand.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.410
Right. Thanks.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.914
(sighs)

20:19.927 --> 20:22.213
Um, I put in dissolvable sutures,

20:22.263 --> 20:25.380
so you don't have to see me again.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.476
You need to talk to Dhara again.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.433
There might be another girl
missing from this neighborhood.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.564
Okay, you lost me.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.770
Okay, Aisha lvres disappeared
from Garrison Park.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.653
That's the same spot that Dhara
stole the ice cream truck.

20:40.698 --> 20:43.064
McNally, hundreds of kids
go to that park.

20:43.117 --> 20:46.075
13, skinny, long, dark hair.
Sound familiar?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.532
Well, apparently, last summer,
there were two girls,

20:48.581 --> 20:49.912
same age, same description,

20:49.957 --> 20:51.697
that also went missing
from this neighborhood.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.037
(loud clank)
(all) Ohh.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.292
What?

20:55.337 --> 20:58.875
Power's out. I'll call you back.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.539
(static)

21:00.593 --> 21:02.504
Just lost power at the station.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.589
Yeah, not just the station.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.594
Power's off across the whole city.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.973
Rookie, our bad luck
just got a whole lot worse.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.599
(horns honking)

21:23.282 --> 21:26.240
Yeah, honking's gonna make
the power come back on!

21:27.578 --> 21:30.285
(Andy) Hey, sorry.
Have you guys seen this girl?

21:30.331 --> 21:31.616
No?

21:31.665 --> 21:32.871
Thank you.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.787
Hey, girls, hi.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.373
Listen, have you seen this little girl?
Her name's Aisha.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.959
No? You don't go to school
with her or anything?

21:41.008 --> 21:42.339
No?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.345
(police radio chatter)

21:49.433 --> 21:50.422
(car alarm chirps,
trunk door unlocks)

21:50.476 --> 21:52.262
I can't find anyone who's seen Aisha.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.142
Power's out across the whole city.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.644
People got other things on their mind--

21:55.689 --> 21:57.429
end of the world, gettin' laid,

21:57.483 --> 21:59.269
or how $80 worth of meat
in my freezer has got, like,

21:59.318 --> 22:00.649
two hours before it goes off.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.436
So what, we shouldn't even look for her?

22:03.489 --> 22:07.573
No, no. We did look.
We just couldn't find her.

22:07.618 --> 22:11.156
(sighs) Andy, uh, the girl's 13.

22:11.205 --> 22:12.194
Aisha.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.909
Aisha is 13,

22:13.958 --> 22:15.164
and around here,
that's practically a grown-up.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.574
Probably she just had a fight
with her mom

22:16.627 --> 22:18.913
'cause she didn't like her boyfriend
or girlfriend or whatever.

22:18.963 --> 22:22.547
Now she's punishing mom
by playing hide-and-seek.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.708
The girl who stole
the ice cream truck--

22:25.761 --> 22:27.342
you said that she had, uh,

22:27.388 --> 22:29.094
- fresh tar on her feet?
- Yeah.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.805
Yeah, come check this out.
What does that look like to you?

23:06.886 --> 23:07.921
Aisha?

23:07.970 --> 23:10.427
(Oliver whistles a call)

23:10.472 --> 23:12.087
She's not a cocker spaniel.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.637
You know, you take upstairs.
Five minutes.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.098
And if she's not here,
we gotta--we gotta get back to business.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.512
Okay.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.520
(cell phone beeps)
Emergency services are overloaded.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.359
- I keep getting cut off.
(inhales deeply)

23:29.992 --> 23:33.029
All right. Well, we got this.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.034
Can you not be stupid right now?

23:35.080 --> 23:36.365
We have to get that woman to a hospital.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.404
(moaning loudly)

23:37.458 --> 23:39.073
You know, she's obviously
not in her right mind,

23:39.126 --> 23:41.333
endangering herself...
(lowers voice) and her baby.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.209
I say wejust arrest her and take her in.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.495
Gail, she's terrified.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.584
Stressing her out
is the last thing we want to do.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.875
We just need to keep her calm
and maybe deliver the baby.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.259
- (Anna groans loudly)
- It's no big deal.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.296
Okay, just because we watched
that really gross video

23:53.349 --> 23:56.261
at the academy does not mean
we know how to do this.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.800
We'll figure it out.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.761
(Anna) Ohh!

24:00.814 --> 24:04.682
So... how are we doing in here?

24:04.735 --> 24:06.100
(straining) I'm pretty sure
I'm having a baby!

24:06.153 --> 24:07.563
Oh, good.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.571
Um, can you see how far I'm dilated?

24:10.616 --> 24:12.072
Oh, God. | see the head.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.948
(Anna) Ohh!

24:13.994 --> 24:16.451
Uh, you worked with a birth coach, right?

24:16.497 --> 24:17.703
Oh, yeah!

24:17.748 --> 24:19.454
Okay, good.
Here's what I need you to do.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.116
I want you to take Gail's hand
and teach her how to breathe.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.204
You can--You can do that, right?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.914
- Okay. Okay.
- Good.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.920
- Gail, hand, now!
- Yeah.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.706
- Here we--Aah!
- Aah!

24:28.759 --> 24:30.169
- Anna.
- Yeah?

24:30.219 --> 24:31.675
Your body doesn't want
to wait for the medics.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.506
It wants to have this baby right now,

24:33.555 --> 24:36.217
so we're just gonna do
what it tells us and listen to it, okay?

24:36.266 --> 24:37.255
- (shrieks)
- Okay.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.721
-Aah!
- Oh, God!

24:39.770 --> 24:41.601
- (screaming)
- That's good. That's good.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.351
Hey, uh, Mr. Singh.
Sorry. Can I have a minute?

24:46.360 --> 24:49.648
Officer, we've been here two hours.
I'd like to take my daughter home.

24:49.697 --> 24:50.686
I know. I'm really sorry.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.354
The power outage
has everything jammed up.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.148
So we just--we just, uh,
need you to fill out

24:54.201 --> 24:56.442
some Child Services forms
at the front desk.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.826
Child Services?

24:57.871 --> 25:00.487
Yeah, it's just a formality.
Whenever we bring in

25:00.541 --> 25:02.657
an unaccompanied minor,
we have to report it.

25:02.710 --> 25:06.168
Just right over there.
They'll take care of you at the desk.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.753
I'll be right back.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.460
Thanks very much. Just a minute.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.463
You want to sit down
and wait for your dad?

25:14.471 --> 25:15.802
Okay?

25:16.223 --> 25:18.054
Sorry it's so hot in here.

25:22.229 --> 25:25.687
Dhara, my partner thinks she knows
why you stole the ice cream truck.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.690
I don't... know.
I don't remember.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.692
Well, she has this idea

25:30.738 --> 25:32.649
that maybe you were running away
from something.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.648
Dhara, did somebody try to hurt you?

25:42.416 --> 25:44.327
There's another girl
who might be in trouble,

25:44.585 --> 25:47.122
and I need to know what you know
so I can help her.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.661
Will you help me, please?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.171
No.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.548
Please?

25:54.762 --> 25:58.300
If you tell him, he'll never
let me outside alone again.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.256
I won't tell him. I promise.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.224
Dhara, did someone try
to take you from the park?

26:09.943 --> 26:11.023
A man?

26:12.863 --> 26:15.195
Okay. Can you tell me
what he looked like?

26:16.575 --> 26:17.906
Yes.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.452
- Go. Keep going! Keep going!
- You're doing great.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.826
- You're doing so awesome!
- You're doing great.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.078
- This is amazing! Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.533
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.244
- Okay, push! Push!
- It's okay. You're doing great.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.658
- You're doing awesome!
- You're doing great!

26:29.880 --> 26:32.747
- (screams)
- One more. | see the shoulders!

26:32.800 --> 26:35.758
Oh, my God. Take us home.
Take us home. One more.

26:35.803 --> 26:36.883
- (screams)
- You're doing awesome.

26:36.929 --> 26:37.918
- Okay, come here.
- (crying)

26:37.971 --> 26:39.256
Cut the cord. The cord!

26:39.306 --> 26:40.546
Here. Here's--Okay, it's good.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.932
It's here. Here it is. (laughs)

26:43.977 --> 26:46.138
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.520
(laughs) Here we go.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.851
You got him?

26:50.901 --> 26:52.357
Oh, my God.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.394
(wailing)

26:57.658 --> 26:59.694
Oh, my God.

26:59.743 --> 27:00.949
(laughs)

27:00.994 --> 27:02.530
Oh, my God.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.241
He's so happy.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.874
(Oliver on radio) Hey, look, there's
no sign of her down here, McNally.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.455
It's time to get back
to business, all right?

27:10.504 --> 27:11.584
Meet me at the front entrance.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.330
Okay. I'm just gonna take
one more look on my way down.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.172
(Oliver on radio) All right.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.511
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.927
Officer, what's, uh, what's going on?

27:24.852 --> 27:26.388
You know, your front door's busted.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.597
I'm working.
I've been fixing the AC all afternoon.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.059
Yeah, it's not gonna work,
not until the power's back up.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.520
In the meantime,
you might want to fix that door.

27:33.569 --> 27:34.775
All right.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.356
(metal clangs in distance)

27:36.780 --> 27:37.895
Did you hear that?

27:40.450 --> 27:42.941
Yeah, let's open this up.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.657
No problem.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.242
McNally, you were right.
Ice cream truck girl

27:47.291 --> 27:49.327
was running from the rec center
over on Walnut.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.707
Yeah, we're here right now.
The place was clear,

27:50.752 --> 27:52.333
but the front door was busted.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.585
Yeah, that's how she got out.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.336
Dhara said she was grabbed
by an employee--

27:55.382 --> 27:58.419
big guy, brown hair.
She managed to fight him off and get away.

27:58.468 --> 28:01.175
We're working on a name right now.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.086
(door creaks, closes)

28:05.058 --> 28:07.674
Hey, Aisha? It's the police.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.509
Are you here?

28:12.524 --> 28:13.684
(distant clanking)

28:13.734 --> 28:16.020
Ah, came from there. What is that?

28:16.069 --> 28:17.479
That's the basement.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.276
Hey, you know what? You wait here.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.282
I'll be back in just a minute.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.114
Ohh!

28:28.749 --> 28:31.741
(groaning)

28:33.837 --> 28:36.169
(grunting)

28:38.342 --> 28:40.503
(gunshots)

28:40.552 --> 28:42.167
(siren wailing)
What was that?

28:42.221 --> 28:43.927
Gunshots.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.963
Oh, God.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.131
Officer Shaw!

28:48.185 --> 28:49.971
Oliver!

28:50.020 --> 28:51.851
Oliver!

28:53.982 --> 28:57.349
Dispatch, 1519. Officer down.
Where are you hit?

28:57.402 --> 28:59.734
(strained voice) I took it in the vest.
Ohh! It hurts like hell!

28:59.780 --> 29:01.270
I know. I know. Don't move.
I'm gonna help you, okay?

29:01.323 --> 29:02.938
He took my gun,
and he's got the girl down there.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.243
- You gotta--You gotta go.
- No, I'm not gonna leave you.

29:05.285 --> 29:09.324
He just shot a cop. He is done.
He's gonna kill her. Go.

29:10.958 --> 29:12.198
(Andy draws gun)
- McNally, be careful.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.834
(loud clanking)

29:20.884 --> 29:24.047
(panting)

29:27.891 --> 29:29.847
(clank)

29:29.893 --> 29:33.056
Ohh!

29:37.818 --> 29:40.810
(tires skid, siren wails)

29:59.256 --> 30:03.249
(breathing hard)

30:03.302 --> 30:05.133
(clanking continues)

30:11.101 --> 30:12.591
(whispers) Oh, God. Okay.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.636
- Oh! Oh, God.
- (muffled crying)

30:15.689 --> 30:19.147
Okay. Shh. Don't say anything.
I'm the police, okay?

30:19.192 --> 30:21.399
Just be quiet.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.481
(muffled crying continues)

30:28.035 --> 30:30.242
(muffled crying continues)
Shh!

30:32.831 --> 30:34.446
Police! Don't move!

30:35.584 --> 30:36.573
Put your hands up!

30:37.210 --> 30:38.586
Don't move!

30:39.296 --> 30:40.877
Put your hands in the air.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.629
Don't move! (screams)

30:48.472 --> 30:51.964
(shells clatter, echoing)

31:26.009 --> 31:28.295
(breathing hard)

31:32.766 --> 31:35.929
It's all right, honey.
You're all right. You're okay.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.599
(Aisha whimpers)

31:41.608 --> 31:43.974
(whispers) It's okay. It's okay.

31:48.949 --> 31:49.938
(normal voice) It's okay.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.649
It's okay.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.579
(Dov) Everything looks good,
but because he's a month early,

32:01.628 --> 32:05.120
the medics would like to take you both
to the hospital just to be safe.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.217
I'll leave a message with your husband

32:08.260 --> 32:11.093
so he knows to meet you there
as soon as he gets to town, okay?

32:11.138 --> 32:12.548
Oh, no, no, no. I can't go.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.928
Anna, your baby needs
to go to the hospital.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.259
You can stay here,

32:15.308 --> 32:17.435
but I really think you
should be with him right now.

32:17.477 --> 32:20.514
(fusses)

32:21.565 --> 32:24.648
| tell you what--

32:24.693 --> 32:25.853
take my hand.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.439
I'll go with you in the ambulance.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.444
If you can't take it,
just give me the look.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.276
I'll have 'em shoot you up
with so many sedatives,

32:32.325 --> 32:33.986
you won't know what's going on.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.117
I mean, I might take some myself, too.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.323
(chuckles)

32:39.458 --> 32:41.915
Okay. I'll go.

32:41.960 --> 32:46.124
But I'm still not naming
my baby after you, Dov.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.458
Okay, I can live with that.

32:52.304 --> 32:56.889
Okay, I'll grab this. Baby.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.798
And that's as much
as you can remember?

32:58.852 --> 33:02.265
Yeah. I mean,
that's what happened, so that's all.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.895
Something else might come back to you

33:03.940 --> 33:06.397
once you have a little distance.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.399
Uh, yeah, I guess. It's--

33:08.445 --> 33:10.481
| just really don't think
there's gonna be anything else.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.942
We'll take care of the rest
once the power's back

33:12.991 --> 33:14.231
and we can reach your union rep.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.912
Um, when can I get back to work?

33:20.957 --> 33:23.073
As soon as the shooting's
been officially cleared.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.787
Seems pretty straightforward.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.415
Thank you.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.262
You were in there a while.

33:38.308 --> 33:39.889
Your shift's been over an hour.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.847
Yeah, who knew killing somebody
required so much paperwork?

33:42.896 --> 33:45.729
(scoffs) Ugh.
I'm so tired, Ijust--

33:46.650 --> 33:48.186
Ijust want to curl up in my bed.

33:48.235 --> 33:49.566
This case is big.

33:49.611 --> 33:50.817
lDENT's over at the rec center,

33:50.862 --> 33:52.477
and they already pulled up bone fragments
from at least two victims.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.523
Could be more. And you got him.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.361
Whole division's gonna know by tomorrow.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.247
I'm sure it'll mean more to you in the morning,

34:01.289 --> 34:02.699
once you've had a chance to get some sleep.

34:02.749 --> 34:06.492
I'll give you a call, all right?
Let you know what we find.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.378
"We"? Are--Are you on the case?

34:09.422 --> 34:12.380
Not officially,
but I offered to go over and help.

34:12.425 --> 34:15.588
l was gonna go right away,
but I wanted to see you first.

34:15.637 --> 34:18.219
Now?

34:18.265 --> 34:20.802
Okay. I mean,
l-l guess I just thought that...

34:20.850 --> 34:23.512
This case... is big.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.349
You know,
why don't I give you a ride home?

34:28.024 --> 34:29.013
All right?
Make sure you're okay?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.523
- That's okay.
- No, really.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.309
It's only 15 minutes.
It's not a big deal.

34:32.362 --> 34:36.150
Luke, just go, okay?

34:36.199 --> 34:39.236
I'm gonna be fine.
I am so exhausted right now,

34:39.286 --> 34:41.322
| just want to go home and go to bed.

34:41.371 --> 34:42.907
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.075
I'll call you first thing,
let you know what we find.

34:48.128 --> 34:49.993

.l‘ It hurts .l‘

34:58.179 --> 34:59.305
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.427
J‘ Love hurts .l‘

35:00.473 --> 35:03.089
Just got back from the hospital.

35:03.143 --> 35:05.509
Shaw's already milking this
for all it's worth.

35:06.688 --> 35:09.600
Made me do a burger run.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.605
How long is he gonna be in for?

35:11.651 --> 35:14.563
A broken rib?
Ah, he'll be out tomorrow,

35:14.613 --> 35:16.945
back on the job in a week.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.946
(laughs) God.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.948
If he thought I was cursed before...

35:20.994 --> 35:22.279
Are you kidding me?

35:22.329 --> 35:25.116
He'd lost his gun.
You--You got it back.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.872
I'd say you're his guardian angel
right about now.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.123
Thanks.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.917
How you doing?

35:31.963 --> 35:34.796
Me? I'm... great. Totally fine.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.206
Okay.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.999
You killed someone today.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.920
Well, I didn't really have a choice, so...

35:43.475 --> 35:44.635
You wanna talk about it?

35:44.684 --> 35:46.185
Not really. No.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.099
.l‘ I'm sorry that .l‘

35:50.148 --> 35:51.137
Okay.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.806
You change your mind, you call me.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.441
- .l‘ I let you down .l‘
- Thanks.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.986
Andy, you did everything right today.

35:59.032 --> 36:01.318
You trusted your gut,
and you were right.

36:05.038 --> 36:06.949
- .l‘ I let you down .l‘
- Mm-hmm.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.671
(whispers) Yeah.

36:13.713 --> 36:14.998
.l‘ l'm aflood .l‘

36:15.048 --> 36:16.709
Okay. All right.

36:20.303 --> 36:24.717
.l‘ With disaster .l‘

36:25.725 --> 36:27.010
(door closes)

36:33.942 --> 36:35.523
(shifts gears)

36:35.568 --> 36:37.650
(turns off engine)

36:37.904 --> 36:39.610
I booked 62 people today.

36:39.656 --> 36:42.318
- What?
- Yeah. 62.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.985
And each one was a biggerjerk
than the last.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.701
But it all seems so insignificant
next to delivering a baby.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.706
(chuckles)

36:52.752 --> 36:55.710
Yeah, it was pretty great.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.212
You know,
I was pretty great today.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.543
l was.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.548
I bet you were.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.550
Hey, listen.
About this morning...

37:03.596 --> 37:06.554
I don't know. lwas, uh...

37:06.599 --> 37:08.339
l was--l was tired.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.384
And the last couple days,

37:10.437 --> 37:12.894
I've been feeling like I don't belong.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.145
And l'm--l'm sorry.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.557
You know, not everyone in this city
is a selfish idiot.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.602
(chuckles)

37:25.452 --> 37:28.159
(drum beating in distance)

37:28.204 --> 37:29.910
What--What is that?

37:29.956 --> 37:31.287
(drumming continues,
crowd speaking indistinctly)

37:31.332 --> 37:32.913
- What is it?
- You've gotta be kidding me.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.752
Hey, is Dale here, guys?

37:37.797 --> 37:39.003
Evening, officer.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.505
Hey, man.
What, uh, what's going on?

37:41.551 --> 37:44.167
I had some stuff left over from a job,

37:44.220 --> 37:46.176
so... ljust figured...

37:46.973 --> 37:49.009

Yeah, it's--it's cool.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.520
lt's--lt's actually kind of perfect.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.525

.l‘ Some things in the ground .l‘

40:31.387 --> 40:37.257
.l‘ Even with this season coming around .l‘

40:37.352 --> 40:41.061
.l‘ lt's green's last gasp .l‘

40:41.105 --> 40:42.970
.l‘ And leaves brown .l‘

40:44.567 --> 40:50.312
.l‘ And autumn days are winding down .l‘

40:54.827 --> 40:57.819
(man on TV, indistinct)

41:03.795 --> 41:06.161
- Power's back on.
- (sighs)

41:06.214 --> 41:09.957
(man on TV) Here's the handoff.
He found a tight seam down the sideline.

41:10.009 --> 41:14.002
I guess that means
everything's back to normal.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.717
I should just turn a few things off.

41:17.767 --> 41:24.309
.l‘ I got to get it out of my head .l‘

41:24.357 --> 41:26.313
.l‘ And make good .l‘
(cell phone rings)

41:26.859 --> 41:29.521
J‘ On some things I've said J‘
(Hng)

41:29.570 --> 41:30.559
(ring)

41:30.613 --> 41:35.949
(Hng)
J‘ You overheard my plans .l‘

41:37.036 --> 41:40.153
.l‘ And find me out .l‘

41:40.206 --> 41:44.119
.l‘ As the talker that I am .l‘

41:44.168 --> 41:49.663
.l‘ But holidays are made for reading .l‘

41:49.716 --> 41:53.174
.l‘ And remembering things .l‘

41:53.219 --> 41:56.711
.l‘ That are worth repeating .l‘

41:56.764 --> 41:59.597
J‘ In the clatter of the afternoon .l‘

41:59.642 --> 42:04.011
J‘ In the sunlight that is left .l‘

42:04.063 --> 42:08.147
.l‘ We can make a list of things .l‘

42:08.192 --> 42:10.399
Yeah, I guess everything
goes back to normal.

42:10.445 --> 42:16.236
.l‘ To forget the false starts
and the loose strings .l‘

42:16.284 --> 42:18.570
.l‘ The feelings of regret .l‘

42:18.619 --> 42:24.410
J‘ That ring on a day that you
haven't done much of anything .l‘
