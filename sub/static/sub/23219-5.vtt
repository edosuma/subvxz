00:24.485 --> 00:27.765
Already?
They've started already?

00:27.845 --> 00:29.605
Think it's just a rehearsal, love.

00:29.685 --> 00:32.165
They've been playing
the same three songs since 1795.

00:32.244 --> 00:33.885
What do they need to rehearse for?

00:33.965 --> 00:36.685
Well, practice makes perfect, Aunt Mary.

00:36.765 --> 00:39.085
You know, that is why they are
so cracker.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.445
I'm sorry?

00:40.525 --> 00:42.445
Did you just call
the Orange Order "cracker"?

00:42.525 --> 00:44.085
I'm considering joining.

00:44.165 --> 00:46.405
I don't think they accept
Catholics, Orla,

00:46.485 --> 00:49.125
or, you know,
acknowledge our right to exist.

00:49.205 --> 00:52.485
Give us a hand here, Gerry.
This'll not close.

00:53.645 --> 00:55.125
We need to shift ourselves.

00:55.205 --> 00:57.285
- We're the last Fenians standing.
- Relax, love.

00:57.365 --> 01:00.085
We've a good two or three hours
before the rioting starts.

01:00.165 --> 01:02.765
I'll not settle myself
until we're over that border, Da.

01:04.004 --> 01:06.645
You're absolutely sure we need
the big clock, love?

01:06.725 --> 01:09.445
- We've been through this.
- Don't want to bring the wee clock?

01:09.525 --> 01:10.965
I can't be doing with the wee clock.

01:11.045 --> 01:12.925
What exactly is your problem
with the big clock?

01:12.965 --> 01:14.845
I wouldn't say I have a problem, as such.

01:14.925 --> 01:17.285
It's just much heavier
and takes up a lot of room.

01:17.365 --> 01:19.245
I'm telling you, Mary.
That's how it starts.

01:19.325 --> 01:21.685
Now he's dictating
what size of clock you can pack.

01:21.765 --> 01:23.781
Next he'll be telling you
what to wear, what to say.

01:23.805 --> 01:27.405
Before you know it, you'll be faking
your own death, assuming a new identity.

01:27.485 --> 01:30.965
Erin, I told you not to let him watch
that <i> Sleeping with the Enemy.</i>

01:31.045 --> 01:32.861
- Couldn't stop him, Mammy.
- Great show.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.605
Stick that in the boot.

01:36.405 --> 01:38.885
You'll be as well
getting one of the wains to do it.

01:39.605 --> 01:40.925
Out of the way.

01:47.645 --> 01:48.845
Right.

01:48.925 --> 01:51.765
Listen to it. I mean, just listen to it.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.485
They can't... I mean, they don't...
Why do they have to be so loud?

01:54.525 --> 01:56.805
- Breathe, love.
- It's far worse for me, Clare.

01:56.885 --> 02:00.445
- I mean, my hearing is impeccable.
- I've read the same paragraph 47 times

02:00.525 --> 02:04.965
because I can't concentrate,
because... Oh my God, the noise!

02:05.045 --> 02:07.165
This whale, he's a bad brute, Mrs. Quinn.

02:07.245 --> 02:09.245
I have to know if they catch him.

02:09.324 --> 02:10.884
Can I come away with you, please?

02:11.525 --> 02:14.725
Okay, well, if your mother has
no objections, I don't see why not.

02:14.805 --> 02:17.165
Thank you. Thank you.

02:17.245 --> 02:19.525
I'll never forget this. Thank you!

02:19.605 --> 02:23.325
She's taking you to a caravan in Portnoo.
She's not giving you a kidney, Clare.

02:23.405 --> 02:25.485
Listen, Mary. I just did a reading.

02:26.205 --> 02:30.685
The cards say if we go on this wee holiday
we're placing ourselves in grave danger,

02:30.765 --> 02:32.885
which I'm not buzzing about, to
be honest.

02:32.965 --> 02:34.565
You're not psychic, Aunt Sarah.

02:34.645 --> 02:36.005
I am psychic, Erin.

02:36.085 --> 02:38.725
I did a course. I got a certificate.

02:39.685 --> 02:42.085
Aye, this does not look good.

02:42.165 --> 02:43.885
Still no sign of the lottery numbers?

02:43.965 --> 02:45.365
No, Daddy.

02:45.445 --> 02:49.605
This psychic carry-on, it's not
all it's cracked up to be, you know.

02:49.685 --> 02:54.365
Last night,
I woke up to this wailing sound.

02:54.445 --> 02:57.005
I thought to myself,
"Jesus, it's Granny Pat.

02:57.085 --> 02:59.245
She's trying to cross over."

02:59.325 --> 03:01.445
Now, it turned out
it was only Aggie next door.

03:01.525 --> 03:04.365
She'd put the electric blanket
on full whack

03:04.445 --> 03:06.525
and scalded the legs of herself.

03:06.605 --> 03:09.885
But still, it could
just as easily have been...

03:09.965 --> 03:11.765
The disembodied spirit of a dead relative?

03:11.845 --> 03:14.285
Exactly. My nerves are wrecked.

03:14.365 --> 03:16.805
I'm living on a knife's edge here.

03:16.885 --> 03:19.765
- Is there any Rice Krispies?
- Shh! Shh!

03:19.845 --> 03:22.205
This is the best bit.

03:23.085 --> 03:25.445
Okay, everyone. Remain calm.

03:25.525 --> 03:29.285
I need you all to listen very carefully.

03:32.925 --> 03:35.685
Okay, I'm going in.

03:35.765 --> 03:37.965
For the love of God,

03:38.045 --> 03:39.205
don't come in here!

03:39.285 --> 03:41.221
- Everything all right, Mary?
- Stay back, Deidre.

03:41.245 --> 03:43.005
This place is a death trap.

03:43.085 --> 03:44.325
Mary, I hate to do this to you,

03:44.405 --> 03:46.021
but me and Martin are both
working nights,

03:46.045 --> 03:48.781
and I'm nervous about leaving these two,
what with the day that's on it.

03:48.805 --> 03:50.685
Don't suppose you could
take them with you?

03:50.765 --> 03:52.885
- Ach, away, Deidre, it's just...
- The English thing?

03:53.485 --> 03:55.125
Listen, Mary, I understand.

03:55.205 --> 03:57.685
I mean, he's my nephew,
and even I find it hard to get past.

03:57.765 --> 04:00.965
If I'm totally honest, there's times
when I look at him and I feel...

04:01.045 --> 04:03.965
well, it's pure hatred.

04:04.045 --> 04:06.925
- I'll not dress it up.
- No, no, it's not the English thing.

04:07.005 --> 04:09.245
Hope to God it's not the gay thing
you're offended by.

04:09.325 --> 04:12.365
- There is no gay thing.
- Because I'd be disappointed in you, Mary,

04:12.445 --> 04:14.445
- I'll not lie.
- Of course not.

04:14.525 --> 04:17.605
I mean, if anything, the gay thing
sort of cancels out the English thing.

04:17.685 --> 04:19.765
Again, no gay thing.

04:19.845 --> 04:23.165
You wouldn't move over there, James?
I can't see past your massive closet.

04:23.245 --> 04:25.021
I'm just not sure
we'll have room in the caravan.

04:25.045 --> 04:28.005
It'll be grand. Us men can camp outside.

04:28.085 --> 04:29.685
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

04:29.765 --> 04:32.005
Run and ask Jim across the road
for the lend of his tent.

04:32.045 --> 04:34.045
Well, thanks a million, Mary.
I owe you one.

04:34.125 --> 04:37.365
If you want our Ryan to sort that gable
wall of yours out, you've only to ask.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.965
What's wrong with our gable wall?

04:41.885 --> 04:44.845
- Christ's sake.
- Do you think it's an omen?

04:47.045 --> 04:48.925
Right?

04:49.005 --> 04:50.325
Now watch.

04:53.965 --> 04:56.525
- What about that?
- Whoa!

04:56.605 --> 04:59.725
I tell you, girls, the double glazing,
it'll change your life.

04:59.805 --> 05:02.445
Yes, as I said, it's...

05:02.525 --> 05:05.725
it's very impressive, Jim,
but we're actually in a bit of a hurry,

05:05.805 --> 05:07.445
so if we could just grab that tent...

05:14.285 --> 05:16.085
Mind-blowing.

05:16.165 --> 05:17.925
What are they, stilts?

05:18.805 --> 05:20.205
Golf clubs.

05:20.285 --> 05:22.565
I thought... spatulas.

05:22.645 --> 05:26.085
- They're rifles.
- Really? Are you sure?

05:26.165 --> 05:27.485
Fairly sure.

05:27.565 --> 05:31.645
I also don't understand what connection
spatulas, golf clubs or stilts

05:31.725 --> 05:33.525
would have to the Irish Resistance.

05:33.605 --> 05:35.765
Christ, he's a dose.

05:35.845 --> 05:37.365
Right. Once your tent is erect...

05:38.725 --> 05:41.165
...you'll want to think about
where to safely store your food,

05:41.245 --> 05:43.205
because believe me, girls,

05:43.285 --> 05:46.485
you do not want to attract predatory
animals into your sleeping area.

05:47.405 --> 05:49.525
Bears are particularly vicious.

05:49.605 --> 05:52.261
Yeah, I'm not sure how many bears
there are in Portnoo, though, Jim.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.285
But there was a cheetah
on the beach one time.

05:54.365 --> 05:55.645
That was a greyhound, Orla.

05:56.605 --> 05:58.005
I know what I saw.

06:03.645 --> 06:05.765
Gave you the Intrepid, did he?

06:05.845 --> 06:08.205
That's his second-best tent, you know.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.085
Tell you what, son.

06:10.165 --> 06:11.885
I'm putting you in charge of it, okay?

06:11.965 --> 06:14.125
Oh, please don't.
Please, don't put me in charge of it.

06:14.205 --> 06:15.965
You'll be all right.

06:16.045 --> 06:19.205
Right, there's too many of us for one car.
Some of you'll have to go with my da.

06:19.285 --> 06:20.405
Can I? Can I?

06:20.485 --> 06:23.165
'Cause Joe drives really fast.

06:23.245 --> 06:26.405
He, like, runs through red lights and
takes corners on two wheels. It is class!

06:26.485 --> 06:28.085
It really is.

06:28.165 --> 06:30.285
I think I'll hop in with Mr. Quinn,
if that's okay.

06:30.365 --> 06:31.525
Me too.

06:31.605 --> 06:32.981
I'll go with me da. He lets me smoke.

06:33.005 --> 06:36.245
You're coming? What about the grave
danger we're putting ourselves in?

06:36.325 --> 06:40.765
It's a concern, but so is the fact I have
nothing in for me Sunday dinner, so...

06:40.845 --> 06:42.725
All right, Joe, if you just follow me.

06:43.965 --> 06:46.125
Now, why should I follow you?

06:46.205 --> 06:48.085
- I've got the map.
- Aye.

06:48.165 --> 06:51.005
- Well, now I have the map.
- Ach, Da.

06:51.085 --> 06:54.165
Joe, it's all just a bit trickier today.

06:54.245 --> 06:55.685
There are so many roadblocks up.

06:55.765 --> 06:58.325
There are so many diversions and,
you know, I drive for a living.

06:58.365 --> 07:00.645
He says this like it's something
to be proud of.

07:00.725 --> 07:02.845
Look, we just need
to get out of this place as quickly

07:02.885 --> 07:04.965
and as quietly as possible.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.845
You know what age I am, boy?

07:07.925 --> 07:10.525
You know how many of these parades
I've lived through?

07:12.765 --> 07:16.045
You think I don't realize
how quickly a situation can turn?

07:17.005 --> 07:19.685
Do you think I'd do anything
to put my family at risk?

07:19.765 --> 07:22.405
No, of course not. I'm sorry.

07:24.205 --> 07:25.605
Aye.

07:25.685 --> 07:28.005
What are you looking at,
you tangerine toe?

07:28.085 --> 07:29.765
Okay, Granda.

07:29.845 --> 07:32.845
I think what's happened here is,
now correct me if I'm wrong,

07:32.925 --> 07:35.541
but I think your father has just
driven through a police barricade.

07:35.565 --> 07:36.645
Well, it's done now.

07:36.725 --> 07:38.925
Oh, that's true.
It's probably not even that big a deal,

07:39.005 --> 07:41.285
if you ignore the fact
that Orangemen are circling us

07:41.365 --> 07:42.965
as though we're their fucking prey.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.645
It'll be grand.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.925
I'm starting to understand
how Moby Dick must feel.

07:47.005 --> 07:48.645
Christ, I'm sweating here.

07:58.045 --> 08:01.525
You lot tell me where I can and
can't go in my own town?

08:02.205 --> 08:03.805
Orange bastards!

08:04.645 --> 08:07.085
Sure, didn't I predict this?

08:07.165 --> 08:08.565
No, you didn't.

08:08.645 --> 08:11.845
I said this trip would place us
in grave danger, Erin.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.525
Those were my very words.

08:13.605 --> 08:15.325
This isn't grave danger.

08:15.405 --> 08:17.485
Oh, look. That cop is pointing
his gun at us.

08:17.565 --> 08:21.365
I mean, it's not ideal,
but this is more of a pickle.

08:22.125 --> 08:24.685
It's a pickle, isn't it, Granda?
It's just a pickle.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.165
Assholes!

08:26.245 --> 08:27.645
Okay, then.

08:28.405 --> 08:31.685
- So, would you do me a reading, Sarah?
- I would, surely, love.

08:31.765 --> 08:32.965
Grow up, Michelle.

08:33.044 --> 08:35.605
Deck of cards can't actually
predict your future.

08:35.684 --> 08:37.725
It's ridiculous. It's medieval.

08:37.804 --> 08:39.205
Shower of shites!

08:42.044 --> 08:44.164
They really don't look that happy,
do they?

08:44.245 --> 08:47.061
Why don't we explain it was an accident,
that we don't want any trouble?

08:47.085 --> 08:49.085
- I'm not going out there.
- Send one of the wains.

08:49.165 --> 08:50.285
- What?
- What?

08:50.365 --> 08:52.805
Well, the wee fella's English.
They might respect that.

08:52.885 --> 08:55.325
- I think they would respect that.
- Away you go, son.

08:55.405 --> 08:58.005
- You're not serious.
- It'll be grand.

08:58.085 --> 09:00.845
Underneath it all, I'm sure
they're reasonable enough people.

09:06.485 --> 09:08.925
Absolutely no chance.

09:09.005 --> 09:11.285
And how soon am I gonna meet this fella?

09:11.365 --> 09:13.405
Dead soon. Really soon.

09:13.485 --> 09:15.445
And answer me this. Is he a ride?

09:15.525 --> 09:16.845
Oh, God, aye.

09:16.925 --> 09:19.925
Is it just a casual thing,
or are we talking a keeper here?

09:20.005 --> 09:22.685
I'm thinking marriage.

09:22.765 --> 09:25.685
- Holy fuck.
- Catch yourself on.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.405
To think, I could be
staring at him right now.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.445
You can't marry an Orangeman, Michelle.

09:31.525 --> 09:34.365
That's a pity, 'cause I think
there's something really sexy

09:34.445 --> 09:36.285
about the fact that they hate us so much.

09:42.845 --> 09:44.485
<i>♪ Holiday ♪</i>

09:46.365 --> 09:48.565
<i>♪ Celebrate ♪</i>

09:50.645 --> 09:53.405
I hope your father appreciates the fact
that I was the one

09:53.485 --> 09:55.445
- who got us out of that mess.
- He won't.

09:55.525 --> 09:58.725
Nobody back there actually believed you
were a Japanese tourist, Gerry.

09:58.805 --> 10:01.725
They all thought you were a nutcase.
They took pity on you.

10:01.805 --> 10:04.525
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Dear God, no.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.645
- What's wrong?
- I can't find my purse.

10:06.725 --> 10:09.261
- I can see your purse right there.
- No, that's my sterling purse.

10:09.285 --> 10:12.485
I'm talking about my punt purse.
I can't find my punt purse, Gerry.

10:12.565 --> 10:14.725
Blessed Saint Anthony,
the grace of God has made you

10:14.805 --> 10:16.645
the patron saint
of all things lost and stolen.

10:16.685 --> 10:19.325
I turn to you this day
with childlike love and deep confidence...

10:19.405 --> 10:21.325
- Look, Mary, calm down...
- Calm down, Gerry?

10:21.405 --> 10:22.765
We have no punts.

10:22.845 --> 10:25.125
We can't go to the Free State
without punts.

10:25.205 --> 10:27.725
We're puntless.
We haven't a punt between us.

10:27.805 --> 10:31.045
Oh, God, I think...
I think I'm having a panic attack.

10:31.125 --> 10:34.125
- Oh, stupid punts.
- Over this?

10:34.205 --> 10:36.365
So what happened back there was
totally fine, but this

10:36.445 --> 10:38.941
- is worth having a panic attack about?
- You have to turn around.

10:38.965 --> 10:40.405
There is more chance of me

10:40.485 --> 10:43.845
eloping with your father
to a flip-flop shop in Hawaii...

10:43.925 --> 10:47.725
Look, okay, fine, but that means
we won't be able to buy anything,

10:47.805 --> 10:50.765
which means we'll have no food,
which means we'll all starve to death.

10:50.845 --> 10:54.125
So, you know, on your head be it, Gerry.
Oh, actually, do you know what?

10:54.205 --> 10:55.765
I think I put it in the suitcase.

10:56.845 --> 10:59.325
False alarm there, Saint Anthony.
Sorry for troubling you.

11:00.845 --> 11:02.205
<i>♪ It would be ♪</i>

11:02.285 --> 11:04.565
<i>♪ It would be so nice ♪</i>

11:09.325 --> 11:11.485
What's this prick up to now?

11:18.285 --> 11:21.005
What the hell were you playing at
back there, "Kemosabe"?

11:21.085 --> 11:23.085
That's actually a Native American term.

11:23.165 --> 11:25.445
- Who were you meant to be?
- Japanese.

11:25.525 --> 11:28.525
I didn't think you get much Japanese
tourism in Derry, do you?

11:28.605 --> 11:31.085
Aye, 'cause that's why
it wasn't believable, dickweed.

11:31.165 --> 11:33.701
- What's going on? Why have we stopped?
- Punt purse is in the suitcase.

11:33.725 --> 11:37.325
Punts are such a pain in the ass.
Why can't they just use sterling?

11:37.405 --> 11:40.485
Well, they did for a while, Sarah,
but then, you know, partition happened.

11:40.565 --> 11:42.085
Holy God!

11:44.805 --> 11:46.285
Jesus Christ!

11:46.365 --> 11:48.325
Did you not put him in there, Aunt Mary?

11:48.405 --> 11:51.125
- No, I did not.
- All right? How's it going?

11:51.205 --> 11:53.165
Not too bad. Not too bad. And yourself?

11:54.325 --> 11:55.765
I'm sorry, who are you?

11:55.845 --> 11:58.045
Ah, Emmett's the name.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.845
Well, not my real name,
like, but it'll have to do.

12:01.605 --> 12:02.965
Anyway, I'll not be keeping you.

12:03.045 --> 12:04.765
- No, hold on. Wait.
- Yeah?

12:05.405 --> 12:07.525
Do you mind telling us
what you're doing in there?

12:07.605 --> 12:08.885
Oh, right.

12:08.965 --> 12:11.285
Well, during the last 24 hours,

12:11.365 --> 12:13.965
crossing the border has become
somewhat of a priority for me.

12:14.045 --> 12:15.845
So, I did a bit of asking around,
you know,

12:15.925 --> 12:18.445
just on the off chance someone
would be heading down that way,

12:18.525 --> 12:21.885
and your name came up,
and, there you have it.

12:22.605 --> 12:25.485
- Fantastic.
- All right? Lovely to meet you.

12:26.925 --> 12:29.325
<i>♪ We need a holiday ♪</i>

12:29.405 --> 12:31.125
I'm in shock. It's insane.

12:31.205 --> 12:33.045
- I don't even think I fancy him.
- What?

12:33.125 --> 12:35.165
Well, it's obviously him.
It's obviously my husband.

12:35.245 --> 12:37.285
Like, it's just too much of a coincidence.

12:37.365 --> 12:40.805
Do you remember the whole "us being
in grave danger" thing Sarah mentioned?

12:40.885 --> 12:43.325
Well, I think... I think this might be it.

12:43.405 --> 12:45.285
I thought you said
fortune-telling was medieval.

12:45.325 --> 12:48.485
Yeah, well, something has made me
reassess all that. What was it again?

12:48.565 --> 12:51.725
Oh, aye, the fact that there's
an actual Provo in the boot of our car.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.765
Oh, no! I've lost my bookmark.

12:54.845 --> 12:56.045
Now I've lost my page.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.245
Oh, my God, this day
just goes from bad to worse.

12:58.325 --> 13:00.005
Bit of perspective, maybe, Clare.

13:00.085 --> 13:01.805
I could grow to fancy him, I suppose.

13:01.885 --> 13:04.085
Why doesn't someone just call the police?

13:05.045 --> 13:07.101
'Cause that's not how things
work around here, James.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.365
Well, how do things work here?
How do they work?

13:10.445 --> 13:12.365
Will one of you please explain it to me?

13:12.445 --> 13:16.165
Because sometimes I feel like I've gone
through the fucking looking glass.

13:17.045 --> 13:18.885
Calm down, James.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.565
Aye, don't be such a dick, James.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.365
Was there something else, or...?

13:25.445 --> 13:28.445
Yes. Yes, there was something else,
actually.

13:28.525 --> 13:31.325
I'm sure you have questions.
I just don't really wanna get into it all.

13:31.365 --> 13:33.765
Yeah, well we didn't really
want you to get into our boot.

13:33.845 --> 13:36.285
Maybe just leave the fella be, sure.
What's the odds?

13:36.365 --> 13:38.485
What if they pull us over
at the checkpoint, Joe?

13:38.565 --> 13:40.141
What if the army asks to search the car?

13:40.165 --> 13:42.725
The Brits are flat out
with their own parade.

13:42.805 --> 13:44.845
- They'll not bother with us.
- That's a good point.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.285
- Stay out of it, you.
- Right, in you go, son.

13:47.365 --> 13:49.565
- Ah, Da.
- What do you want me to do?

13:49.645 --> 13:51.325
Turf the wain out
in the middle of nowhere?

13:51.365 --> 13:54.125
But this is dangerous, Joe.
He is dangerous.

13:54.205 --> 13:55.485
I'm not dangerous.

13:55.565 --> 13:56.765
In fairness, Emmett,

13:56.845 --> 13:59.445
if you were dangerous,
you wouldn't say that you were dangerous,

13:59.525 --> 14:00.845
- would you?
- True.

14:01.805 --> 14:04.965
Shh! Can you hear that?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.381
Hear what?

14:06.405 --> 14:08.365
- Come on, Emmett, out you go.
- Ah, ah, ah!

14:08.445 --> 14:09.925
You just stay where you are, son.

14:10.005 --> 14:11.885
Ticking.

14:11.965 --> 14:15.365
It's... it's like a ticking sound.

14:15.445 --> 14:18.165
I'm not comfortable
driving him across the border.

14:18.245 --> 14:19.885
Fine.

14:19.965 --> 14:21.485
I'll drive him.

14:24.245 --> 14:25.525
Oh, dear God.

14:26.525 --> 14:28.725
We're all involved in this, Da.

14:28.805 --> 14:31.165
We'll decide what to do as a family.

14:33.565 --> 14:36.165
Bomb! He has a bomb! Listen, Mammy!

14:36.245 --> 14:39.645
- Listen!
- Ach, Erin, that's just the big clock.

14:50.285 --> 14:53.685
It's aiding and abetting.
We're talking serious jail time here.

14:53.765 --> 14:55.205
Well, it's a risk we have to take.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.485
No, it's not, Joe.

14:56.565 --> 14:59.085
It's not a risk we have to take.
It's a risk we shouldn't take.

14:59.165 --> 15:02.485
- Don't you take that tone with me, boy.
- He seems like a nice enough fella.

15:02.565 --> 15:04.861
- We have to walk away from this.
- What if we can't?

15:04.885 --> 15:07.845
What if we don't help him and
he kills us all because we know too much?

15:07.925 --> 15:10.285
I like him. I think he's a character.

15:12.565 --> 15:14.461
- Well?
- Just a cup of tea for me, please, love.

15:14.485 --> 15:16.725
- Same here.
- And here, thanks, love.

15:16.805 --> 15:20.285
Oh, and some Cokes for the wains, please.
What do you fancy, Sarah?

15:20.365 --> 15:23.365
- I wouldn't mind a wee vodka.
- Make that two.

15:23.445 --> 15:26.645
We don't sell alcohol.

15:26.725 --> 15:29.205
- I'll take a tea.
- Any food?

15:29.285 --> 15:31.125
We're just looking.

15:31.205 --> 15:33.805
- Fine.
- Yeah.

15:33.885 --> 15:36.925
And at 2.25 a burger,
looking is all we'll be doing.

15:37.005 --> 15:38.645
Ah, don't mind me. Just grabbing a knife.

15:40.685 --> 15:43.765
- Take it you haven't decided yet.
- Just leave it with me, son.

15:43.845 --> 15:46.765
Aye, no pressure.
I'll be over here if you need me.

15:47.845 --> 15:49.445
What the hell does he need a knife for?

15:49.525 --> 15:51.085
He's eating his lunch.

15:51.165 --> 15:53.885
God, but he has great teeth, doesn't he?

15:53.965 --> 15:57.445
He really does, but...
now, tell the truth.

15:57.525 --> 16:00.285
The hair. Can you see a ginger tinge?

16:00.365 --> 16:01.965
Now that you mention it...

16:02.885 --> 16:05.285
So Christ only knows
what's lurking downstairs.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.125
And that is a concern.

16:07.205 --> 16:10.325
But spending the rest of your life
with a fugitive is less of a concern?

16:11.285 --> 16:12.685
Absolutely.

16:18.765 --> 16:21.165
- Hey.
- All right?

16:26.045 --> 16:27.245
I think you know who I am.

16:27.325 --> 16:28.325
Yeah.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.925
You sense it.

16:30.005 --> 16:31.925
No, I mean I remember. You're with them.

16:33.045 --> 16:35.325
Look, I just wanted to say, well,

16:35.405 --> 16:38.005
- there's obviously something between us.
- There is?

16:38.085 --> 16:40.685
The physical thing
isn't really working for me yet.

16:40.765 --> 16:43.125
- Right.
- I'm not saying you won't grow on me.

16:43.205 --> 16:45.605
- You're not a bad-looking lad.
- Thank you.

16:45.685 --> 16:49.365
But the ginger element... well,
I've sort of got a borderline phobia.

16:49.445 --> 16:51.365
- I'm not ginger.
- There's a tinge, Emmett.

16:51.445 --> 16:55.845
And while I can't say it won't
be a struggle, I'm willing to try.

16:57.045 --> 16:58.325
Great.

16:58.405 --> 17:00.965
Even though it sort of turns my stomach.

17:01.045 --> 17:02.485
Okay.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.964
You really think this'll work?
That they'll tell us what to do?

17:08.045 --> 17:09.805
Sure, it's worth a try.

17:09.885 --> 17:12.405
Oh! Would you look at that?

17:12.484 --> 17:16.565
- What? What do they say?
- I think... Now, I can't be certain,

17:16.645 --> 17:20.645
but I think they're saying
you should leave Gerry.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.300
I could have told you that years ago,
and I'm not psychic.

17:24.325 --> 17:25.645
Okay.

17:25.724 --> 17:27.845
Look, I've yet to hear
anybody say anything

17:27.925 --> 17:30.941
to convince me that bringing that lad
across the border with us is a good idea.

17:30.965 --> 17:32.005
Shit, he's coming.

17:35.045 --> 17:37.085
I really didn't wanna have to do this.

17:37.165 --> 17:38.885
Jesus Christ!

17:38.965 --> 17:41.525
Get down! Everybody get down!

17:41.605 --> 17:43.845
- Is there something wrong with her?
- Stop that, Erin.

17:47.965 --> 17:49.925
Sorry, Emmett. You were saying?

17:50.485 --> 17:52.285
Didn't wanna put you in this position.

17:52.365 --> 17:55.205
But I can't stress the seriousness
of my situation.

17:55.285 --> 17:56.845
- Anything else?
- Oh, do you know what?

17:56.885 --> 18:00.085
- I wouldn't mind a knickerbocker glory.
- Right.

18:01.765 --> 18:04.845
- You need to help me out here.
- We do that and we're breaking the law.

18:04.925 --> 18:09.005
You recognize the legal system of
a brutal, imperialistic oppressor, do you?

18:09.085 --> 18:11.701
If they can put me in jail for 20 years,
then, yes, Emmett. Yes, I do.

18:11.725 --> 18:14.365
Listen, listen.
Have you killed anyone, son?

18:14.445 --> 18:17.405
No. Well, at least not directly.

18:17.485 --> 18:19.845
Well, there you go. So that settles it.

18:19.925 --> 18:22.045
I don't think that does settle it,
actually, Joe.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.205
You know what's wrong with you, Gerry?

18:24.285 --> 18:26.765
- You're an awful wuss.
- I'm not a wuss.

18:26.845 --> 18:29.405
- You're afraid of your own shadow.
- No, I'm not.

18:29.485 --> 18:31.301
Well, then grow a set of balls
and help the fella out.

18:31.325 --> 18:34.605
I have a set of balls,
thank you very much.

18:34.685 --> 18:37.101
- Oh, seriously, Daddy.
- You're even afraid of that wee girl.

18:37.125 --> 18:38.925
- What wee girl?
- That waitress.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.365
You wanted a cup of tea.

18:41.445 --> 18:44.365
She brought you a Coke and you just sat
there and said sweet Fanny Adams.

18:44.445 --> 18:46.325
Your granda said "fanny".

18:46.405 --> 18:47.925
Well, that's because I like Coke.

18:48.005 --> 18:50.725
- Her customer service is shocking as well.
- Aye, desperate.

18:50.805 --> 18:53.205
- Someone should say something.
- Aye, Gerry!

18:53.285 --> 18:54.765
Gerry should say something.

18:55.365 --> 18:57.245
I will. No problem.

18:57.325 --> 18:58.525
I'll say something.

19:01.445 --> 19:02.605
Excuse me.

19:03.565 --> 19:04.765
Excuse me, please.

19:09.525 --> 19:10.725
What?

19:11.285 --> 19:13.925
Um, I just wanted to say that,
uh, I, um...

19:14.005 --> 19:17.445
I ordered a tea. You brought me a Coke,
and that's not acceptable.

19:17.525 --> 19:19.925
- But you drank the Coke.
- That's not the point.

19:21.405 --> 19:25.405
And your service has been nothing short
of appalling. Your attitude is worse.

19:25.485 --> 19:26.765
It's simply not good enough.

19:26.845 --> 19:28.325
I'll, uh...

19:29.045 --> 19:30.245
I'll bring you a tea.

19:30.325 --> 19:31.445
You do that.

19:33.725 --> 19:34.885
I'm sorry.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.645
I got a bit of bad news today.

19:43.045 --> 19:45.605
I haven't really been able to focus.

19:47.485 --> 19:49.205
I've been a bit distracted, maybe.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.645
I'm sorry.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.645
- I'll just...
- No, no, no.

19:54.725 --> 19:55.965
Ignore all that.

19:57.485 --> 20:00.405
I'll bring your tea right away, sir.

20:06.925 --> 20:09.565
Well, there was absolutely
no need for that.

20:09.645 --> 20:12.045
- Jesus, Gerry.
- Harsh.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.885
- Awful.
- Poor girl.

20:13.965 --> 20:15.965
I can't believe you did that, Daddy.

20:16.045 --> 20:17.045
I...

20:17.885 --> 20:19.165
You asked me to.

20:20.605 --> 20:22.405
How could I have known?

20:22.485 --> 20:25.045
And would you all just stop
looking at me?

20:26.485 --> 20:28.005
Fine.

20:28.645 --> 20:29.845
Fine.

20:29.925 --> 20:31.965
Do you know what? Fine.

20:32.805 --> 20:35.365
I've had it with the lot of you.

20:38.125 --> 20:42.165
And just for the record back there,
I was being an Australian tourist, okay?

20:42.245 --> 20:46.325
Australian. And I happen to think
that my accent was flawless.

20:46.405 --> 20:49.405
"Excuse me, mate.
Can you help us get out of here?"

20:51.045 --> 20:52.405
Flawless!

20:56.525 --> 20:57.525
Okay.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.205
We have to decide what to do here,
one way or another.

21:01.285 --> 21:02.965
- Let's just vote.
- Leave him!

21:03.845 --> 21:05.645
I vote we run away and leave him.

21:05.725 --> 21:08.765
I vote we take him,
for better or worse and all that.

21:08.845 --> 21:10.045
I vote we take him.

21:10.125 --> 21:12.365
- Me too.
- I can't decide.

21:12.445 --> 21:15.685
I decided, but I'm afraid
to say what I've decided.

21:16.725 --> 21:18.525
Why don't we just toss a coin?

21:33.765 --> 21:34.965
Interesting...

21:35.045 --> 21:38.725
So, heads, the wee RA man comes with us.

21:38.805 --> 21:40.045
- Tails, we leave him.
- Mmm.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.245
- Aye. Ready?
- Go on, then.

21:48.085 --> 21:50.925
- What is that, a fish?
- A dolphin, is it?

21:51.005 --> 21:53.565
It sort of looks like Moby Dick, actually.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.325
- Ah, shite I used a punt, didn't I?
- What's on the other side?

21:56.405 --> 21:59.085
- A harp.
- So harp must be the head

21:59.165 --> 22:01.141
- and fish must be the tail?
- Oh, that makes sense.

22:01.165 --> 22:03.285
Yeah, because fish have tails.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.285
- Just do it again with real money?
- This is real money, Sarah.

22:06.365 --> 22:09.725
- You know what I mean, normal money.
- All right. Who has ten pence?

22:09.805 --> 22:10.965
It was him.

22:11.885 --> 22:15.845
The mural on our house, the spray paint,
it was Emmett.

22:15.925 --> 22:19.205
- I can prove it.
- Sly wee bastard.

22:19.285 --> 22:22.685
- You bloody tout.
- Where is Emmett?

22:23.205 --> 22:24.405
There he is.
