00:01.060 --> 00:02.766
NARRATOR: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.800 --> 00:04.688
Did you actually read
any of his book?

00:04.730 --> 00:06.630
Ezra knew who I was
before we met.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.228
He knew who all of us were.

00:08.270 --> 00:09.760
Do you always carry
that much cash around?

00:09.810 --> 00:10.799
Who is the money for?

00:10.840 --> 00:13.001
The money is for Ali.
She's alive.

00:14.540 --> 00:15.632
How did it go?

00:15.680 --> 00:16.806
That cop, Holbrook,
spoke up for my dad.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.739
I was surprised to hear
that you spoke for Mr. Hobbs.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.042
Thank you.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.451
Okay, stop.
What are you up to?

00:26.490 --> 00:28.549
Your mother and I spoke
with Dr. Griggs this morning.

00:28.590 --> 00:31.252
He recommended
a rehab facility in Philly.

00:31.290 --> 00:32.598
Ezra is moving forward
with the book.

00:32.630 --> 00:34.257
He is meeting with his agent
in New York right now

00:34.300 --> 00:35.392
discussing a release date.

00:35.430 --> 00:36.624
Now I know that
everything he says

00:36.670 --> 00:38.228
or has ever said is a lie.

00:38.270 --> 00:39.396
Are you going somewhere?

00:39.440 --> 00:42.102
That's the plan.
I got to get out of here.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.402
It's a simple question,
okay.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.658
Did you
or did you not see me standing

00:45.710 --> 00:46.734
with a shovel that night?

00:46.780 --> 00:47.599
And if you did see me
hurt Ali,

00:47.640 --> 00:49.779
then why didn't you
just call the cops?

00:58.850 --> 00:59.851
( knocking on door)

00:59.890 --> 01:01.152
Hey.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.282
Hi.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.184
Anything
for the dry cleaners?

01:04.230 --> 01:06.289
It was 3 days
in rehab, Mom.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.389
I really did not need
so many sweaters.

01:08.430 --> 01:11.695
I thought, I don't know,
maybe you'd go outside

01:11.730 --> 01:13.834
for some fresh air
or if you got cold.

01:13.870 --> 01:16.338
I did get cold
and then I got the sweats.

01:16.370 --> 01:18.338
You know,
withdrawal symptoms

01:18.370 --> 01:19.701
can't really be stopped
with a cable knit.

01:19.740 --> 01:22.709
They said
that the medical detox

01:22.750 --> 01:24.103
would help mitigate
your discomfort.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.048
It did, mom.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.672
I was so comfortable kicking
my drug habit.

01:28.580 --> 01:29.615
Sorry.

01:31.350 --> 01:32.487
I'm very irritable.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.216
They said to expect irritability
over the next few days.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.424
As long as you're home
and well, I can handle it.

01:41.530 --> 01:42.758
SPENCER:
Don't you walk away from me.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.334
Is there anything you need?

01:47.370 --> 01:50.339
There's left-over carbonara
or I can make a salad

01:50.370 --> 01:51.701
if you'd like
something lighter.

01:51.740 --> 01:53.776
ALISON: You're way
out of your league, Spencer.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.141
SPENCER:
You sure about that?

01:57.180 --> 01:59.774
ALISON: Put that thing down
before you hurt yourself.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.219
Spencer?

02:04.550 --> 02:05.778
I said you look tired.

02:07.820 --> 02:08.912
Maybe you should
get some rest.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.484
Mm?

02:10.530 --> 02:12.395
We have some things
to discuss in the morning.

02:41.690 --> 02:44.250
* Got a secret,
can you keep it *

02:44.290 --> 02:46.724
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:46.760 --> 02:49.297
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:49.330 --> 02:51.764
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:51.800 --> 02:54.189
* If I show you
then I know *

02:54.240 --> 02:56.902
* You won't tell
what I saId *

02:56.940 --> 02:59.374
* 'Cause two can keep
a secret *

02:59.410 --> 03:01.935
* if one of them is dead

03:03.680 --> 03:06.240
Mom?
Have you seen my car keys?

03:06.280 --> 03:07.679
I want to get to school early
and catch up on

03:07.720 --> 03:08.948
any assignments
that I might have missed.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.686
Oh, I'm so sorry
to interrupt.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.312
Honey,
this is Dean Stavros.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.679
He's going to be staying
with us for a while.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.278
Hi.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.878
Sweetheart, you're not going
back to school just yet.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.750
We've already taken
your car keys.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.553
I'll need your cellphone
and your laptop as well.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.864
But why?

03:22.900 --> 03:24.527
There will be no phone calls
of any kind,

03:24.570 --> 03:25.969
no internet, no friends.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.491
We'll be sure to get
your assignments from school.

03:28.540 --> 03:29.700
And how do you expect me
to turn them in?

03:29.740 --> 03:30.764
Carrier pigeon?

03:32.480 --> 03:33.936
You'll earn your privileges
back over time,

03:33.980 --> 03:35.936
as long as you follow
Dean's program.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.709
The doctor said that I was
fine to go back to school,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.809
as long as I agreed
to outpatient counseling.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.309
Could you please excuse us?

03:42.350 --> 03:43.442
I need to talk to my mom.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.912
Actually,
I don't think I can.

03:46.390 --> 03:48.858
Spencer, I'm a drug
and alcohol abuse counselor.

03:48.890 --> 03:50.778
Your parents brought me here
to help you.

03:50.830 --> 03:54.493
I'm gonna be camped out
in the barn, on-call 24/7--

03:54.530 --> 03:56.327
So you're basically
a baby-sitter.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.826
Do you and Dad distrust me
this much?

03:57.870 --> 04:00.691
Quite frankly,
given this latest episode, yes.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.731
I understand you may be
feeling a little ambushed.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.328
Excuse me.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.962
How long am I supposed
to stay under guard?

04:06.010 --> 04:07.773
I have to apologize
for my daughter.

04:07.810 --> 04:08.799
Oh, as long as
you're handing them out,

04:08.840 --> 04:10.444
I would love
an apology from you.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.879
Your father and I
thought the first time

04:11.910 --> 04:13.377
would be the last.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.546
Since you've relapsed--

04:14.580 --> 04:15.979
I would hardly
call this a relapse.

04:16.020 --> 04:18.011
Spencer, look,
I bet your mom would be

04:18.050 --> 04:19.711
a whole lot more open
to hearing you out

04:19.760 --> 04:20.886
if you hand over
your electronics.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.679
Show her
you're Willing to cooperate.

04:39.510 --> 04:42.547
Can I please just call Toby?

04:42.580 --> 04:44.969
I tried him last night and
he hasn't called me back yet.

04:45.010 --> 04:46.375
I've had a conversation
with Toby

04:46.420 --> 04:47.569
and he understands
that you'll be hard

04:47.620 --> 04:48.416
to reach
for the time being.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.039
It will give us
all a chance to focus.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.826
Great.

05:03.430 --> 05:04.590
Where do we start?

05:15.140 --> 05:16.903
Fantastic.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.077
I will go upstairs
and fill this with my dignity.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.785
I'm still at Syracuse.

05:25.820 --> 05:26.912
EMILY: ( on phone ) Does your
dad know what happened?

05:26.960 --> 05:27.984
No. No.

05:28.020 --> 05:30.659
He thinks I'm here
for a Prospective Student Week.

05:30.690 --> 05:33.090
It's 4 days of campus tours,
classroom visits,

05:33.130 --> 05:36.497
and a bunch of
father-daughter bonding time.

05:36.530 --> 05:39.499
How are you doing?
Really.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.839
Um, honestly, I'm just trying
not to think about any of it.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.701
Him. Everything.

05:44.740 --> 05:46.833
EMILY: You don't have to go
through this on your own.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.802
You know,
we can all come up there.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.068
No, it's okay.

05:50.110 --> 05:51.441
I'm not alone.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.573
I just mean that
my dad's here with me.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.575
Look, I've got to go.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.848
The tour's starting.
Bye.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.642
Wow.

05:58.690 --> 05:59.509
Morning, sunshine.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.120
No, don't start.
You look worse than me.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.855
No. I don't.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.524
You ready to learn
about the history

06:08.560 --> 06:10.118
of this
illustrious institution?

06:10.170 --> 06:13.833
I'm ready
for some sleep or coffee.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.137
I don't know, an aspirin.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.603
Yeah, my student
host didn't exactly

06:17.640 --> 06:19.733
offer continental breakfast.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.477
WOMAN: Okay, everyone,
over here for the tour please.

06:23.510 --> 06:26.547
We--we really need to go
on this thing?

06:26.580 --> 06:28.013
I know a place nearby.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.881
Killer pancakes.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.148
You mean bail on the tour?

06:31.190 --> 06:33.408
Only if you want.

06:34.990 --> 06:35.979
I want.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.055
All right.

06:43.530 --> 06:44.599
Give those back.
I need them.

06:44.630 --> 06:46.461
This way,
over here.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.991
Aria finally called me
this morning.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.508
Is she still mad at me?

06:51.540 --> 06:53.872
She's not mad,
she's hurting.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.707
But she sounded okay.

06:55.740 --> 06:56.843
Distant.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.768
Are we still going
to Spencer's later?

06:58.810 --> 06:59.708
It was so weird.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.480
I called her cell
and her mom answered.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.487
There's no visitors

07:03.520 --> 07:05.078
and she's not gonna be
in school for a while.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.179
Probably for the best.

07:07.220 --> 07:08.881
_ I saw Fitz's car
In the teacher's parking lot.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.524
Wait, he's back?

07:10.560 --> 07:11.584
Mm-hmm.

07:11.630 --> 07:13.757
So he just goes to New York
to collect the big,

07:13.800 --> 07:14.926
fat check
for selling us out.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.769
And then what,
comes back here to gloat?

07:16.800 --> 07:19.564
I wish you would have told me
this before I bought tickets.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.760
Do you want to go at all?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.836
I'm sorry, Mike.
I don't know what to say.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.462
Give me a call
when you figure It out.

07:35.650 --> 07:37.811
Looks like he's still pulling
Mona's strings.

07:37.850 --> 07:40.785
Do you think Fitz was
behind whatever that was?

07:40.820 --> 07:42.959
I mean, Mike and Mona didn't
really make much sense unless...

07:42.990 --> 07:44.787
Unless she was spying
on Aria for him.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.053
Now I'm mad.
We should say something.

07:50.230 --> 07:51.697
Are you coming?

07:51.730 --> 07:52.833
I can't.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.929
If you're gonna slash his tires
or bust his headlights,

07:54.970 --> 07:55.994
I'd still be down.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.031
But I don't want to be
in the same room with him.

07:58.070 --> 07:59.833
I know. I get it.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.609
Hey, I'm gonna
ditch last period.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.868
Are you gonna be okay?

08:02.910 --> 08:04.207
Yeah, I'll be fine.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.242
Emily, class doesn't start
for another few minutes.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.963
Okay, I don't know
how much you know

08:25.000 --> 08:26.729
but as close _
as you are to Aria,

08:26.770 --> 08:28.192
I can assume that
you know everything.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.979
I really want to talk
to about this, Emily,

08:35.010 --> 08:35.806
but I would really prefer

08:35.840 --> 08:38.149
if it were outside
of a classroom.

08:38.180 --> 08:39.772
I don't think
that's going to happen.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.886
I've already talked to you
outside of the classroom.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.287
I let you help me
with my college essays.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.582
You tutored me.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.651
You helped me
when I lost my girlfriend.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.549
Why did you do all of that?

08:56.130 --> 08:57.290
What did you get out of it?

08:59.330 --> 09:00.934
There's an assignment
due today,

09:00.970 --> 09:02.767
But I won't be staying
for the class.

09:05.740 --> 09:07.935
Will you make sure
a real teacher gets this?

09:22.860 --> 09:24.782
Hey.

09:24.830 --> 09:25.922
Don't get up.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.827
I don't want to accidentally
run into your mouth again.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.191
Is that what that was?

09:30.230 --> 09:31.219
Look, it wasn't
supposed to happen.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.067
And it's not going
to ever again.

09:33.100 --> 09:33.998
I promise.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.962
I'm sure Travis will be
glad to hear that.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.338
After court, when I passed
the two of you talking,

09:40.380 --> 09:42.132
It seemed like
there was a look.

09:43.380 --> 09:44.347
Do you have
a minute to sit?

09:44.380 --> 09:47.247
You know, I actually
just came to apologize.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.372
I just-- I thought
it would be weird

09:48.420 --> 09:50.308
if I saw you
and I didn't say anything.

09:50.350 --> 09:53.581
Oh. Is there anything else
you want to talk about?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.082
No. I'm good.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.123
Well, there's a couple of things
I'd like to ask you.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.149
Please sit.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.092
What do you know
about this?

10:12.410 --> 10:13.934
I've _never seen
this before.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.732
You recognize
the handwriting?

10:18.750 --> 10:20.672
Why don't you open it up,
read the note inside?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.347
It might look familiar.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.286
What is this?

10:28.320 --> 10:29.981
I was hoping
you could tell me.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.055
I didn't write it,
if that's what you're asking.

10:36.430 --> 10:37.761
Ithought
it was a possibility.

10:39.270 --> 10:41.363
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't ask.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.037
Well, you don't think
that's real, do you?

10:45.070 --> 10:45.832
I mean you're not going to go

10:45.870 --> 10:47.906
looking for Alison now,
are you?

10:47.940 --> 10:49.339
No, don't worry.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.938
We get stuff like that
all the time.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.642
It's probably
just another crackpot.

10:56.450 --> 10:59.112
I have to go meet
my mom for dinner.

10:59.150 --> 11:01.311
It's a little early for that,
don't you think?

11:01.360 --> 11:02.850
It's my turn to cook.

11:19.340 --> 11:23.003
That's good.
No, keep playing.

11:23.050 --> 11:27.043
No, I just-- I just wanted
to give Antonio a little air.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.885
Oh, you named
your guitar Antonio?

11:32.790 --> 11:34.951
I like to think
Antonio named himself.

11:36.220 --> 11:38.051
You slept well?

11:38.090 --> 11:40.820
Um, yeah, a little bit.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.225
I still feel like
my head's a bowling ball,

11:42.260 --> 11:45.229
but I don't think I'm gonna yak
on my shoes anymore.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.362
Hey, that's progress.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.968
You don't normally drink,
do you?

11:53.210 --> 11:55.906
This week's anything
but normal.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.305
Why is that?

12:01.480 --> 12:04.040
Oh, we missed
the last tour, huh?

12:04.090 --> 12:05.045
We can learn
about the Hall of Languages

12:05.090 --> 12:07.388
and the billion dollar
endowment another day.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.391
So your dad... I thought
you were staying with your dad.

12:15.130 --> 12:18.019
I am. Yeah, he's--
he's just right next door.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.060
So what does he profess?

12:23.210 --> 12:24.962
Art history.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.466
You into art, too?

12:26.510 --> 12:28.068
A little.

12:28.110 --> 12:30.772
Um, I like to write,

12:30.810 --> 12:33.347
but who knows now.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.940
What--
what are you looking for?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.184
Hair of the dog.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.757
That's supposed
to cure hangover, right?

12:42.120 --> 12:44.520
God, we totally
raided this thing.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.228
Who drank
the pineapple rum?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.931
Guilty.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.337
How much do you think
all this stuff cost?

12:58.370 --> 12:59.803
No, not too much a lot.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.398
Maybe a couple of
hundred dollars.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.078
I'm serious.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.441
Me, too.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.141
Just tell your dad
you had the drunkies.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.546
And invited a boy over.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.286
Yeah.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.016
Mm, I think that
will go over real well.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.355
* I don't need a parachute

13:16.390 --> 13:20.019
* Baby, if I've got you
baby, if I've got you *

13:20.060 --> 13:21.994
* I don't need a parachute

13:22.030 --> 13:23.497
* You're gonna catch me

13:23.530 --> 13:26.465
* You're gonna catch
if I fall *

14:00.500 --> 14:01.489
Look, somebody else
knows Alison's alive

14:01.540 --> 14:02.529
and they just told the cops.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.208
Does Holbrook know
who it's from?

14:04.240 --> 14:05.935
Did he say if it was
from a guy or a girl?

14:05.970 --> 14:07.176
It's anonymous.

14:07.210 --> 14:09.132
And they're still trying
to figure it out.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.413
I'll be right back.

14:17.620 --> 14:18.484
What's up?

14:18.520 --> 14:20.317
Your text said
I should come find you.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.611
Yeah, my mom wanted
to invite you and your family

14:21.660 --> 14:22.456
over for dinner

14:22.490 --> 14:24.287
just to say
thanks for everything.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.388
That's really nice of her,

14:25.430 --> 14:26.954
but she doesn't have
to go through that.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.456
Trust me,
you don't want to miss it.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.967
She doesn't really
cook often,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.968
but when she does
it's pretty amazing.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.536
Okay.

14:33.570 --> 14:36.130
You know, I was thinking

14:36.170 --> 14:39.537
maybe you and I
could do a meal sometime.

14:39.570 --> 14:40.639
Just the two of us.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.636
Sure.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.477
Wait, is that like a date?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.115
I actually hope it will be.

14:50.450 --> 14:52.088
How about tomorrow night?

14:53.690 --> 14:55.214
Yeah, okay.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.557
Okay.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.391
Did he just ask you out?

15:03.430 --> 15:05.398
Okay, I'm not digging
the timing, but--

15:05.430 --> 15:06.522
Are you even ready
for that?

15:06.570 --> 15:07.798
No, I'm ready.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.559
I just hope nothing else crazy
happens between now and then.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.541
Drinking a glass of salad

15:20.580 --> 15:22.138
is supposed to give me
my life back?

15:22.180 --> 15:24.148
Your body needs
the nutrition.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.078
You'll feel stronger,
you'll think clearer,

15:26.120 --> 15:27.109
you'll sleep better.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.513
I sleep just fine.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.687
I heard you doing laundry
at 2:00 in the morning.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.482
My sheets were dirty.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.122
What, do you want
to analyze those, too?

15:34.160 --> 15:36.549
I just thought
it was unusual.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.296
You know, with ADHD meds
people tend to sleep

15:39.330 --> 15:40.433
a lot during withdrawal.

15:40.470 --> 15:43.234
And you're
definitely irritable.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.567
Any flu-like symptoms?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.032
Not anymore.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.503
What about nightmares?

15:51.680 --> 15:57.585
Um, what about
hallucinations?

15:57.620 --> 15:59.212
Maybe.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.617
They're nothing
to worry about.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.288
It's just your mind and body
getting reacquainted.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.150
Take drugs away
and things come up.

16:06.190 --> 16:08.420
What kind of things?

16:08.460 --> 16:10.667
Things you've forgotten.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.724
Things you've suppressed.

16:11.770 --> 16:15.069
Things you need
to deal with.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.465
When I was first
in recovery,

16:16.500 --> 16:19.435
a healthy diet and exercise
really worked for me.

16:19.470 --> 16:21.506
I mean,
it took the edge off.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.575
It's worth a try.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.601
Ever do yoga?

16:24.650 --> 16:27.175
No, not usually.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.279
I don't really excel
at athletics

16:29.320 --> 16:30.480
unless there's
somebody to beat.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.647
I'd like
to avoid competition.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.317
I think that drive
may have triggered your abuse

16:34.360 --> 16:35.315
in the first place.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.509
But kicking
your ass at tennis

16:36.560 --> 16:38.221
might be very therapeutic.

16:38.260 --> 16:40.023
Yeah, I get the feeling

16:40.060 --> 16:41.596
you'd like to kick
my ass, period.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.166
But I'm in the barn

16:43.200 --> 16:45.361
until your parents
and doctor say otherwise.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.288
So get motivated.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.591
We've got a lot
to cover today.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.134
I'm just gonna take
a quick shower.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.380
Toby, hey, please I really,
really need to talk to you.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.513
I'm starting to worry because
I haven't heard from you.

17:05.550 --> 17:06.778
I just need you to tell me
that I'm not,

17:06.820 --> 17:08.515
like, a horrible person.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.482
( knocking on door)

17:10.530 --> 17:12.225
How come_I don't hear
any running water?

17:20.400 --> 17:25.235
Hanna, I know what you did.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.135
And I am not amused.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.636
Since when is getting
a skinny latte a crime?

17:28.680 --> 17:30.307
_ We're not here
to joke around, Hanna.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.578
Gabe,
what is she talking about?

17:31.610 --> 17:33.544
It won't be hard for me to match
your handwriting to the note.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.413
When I do, I'll have to bring
you down for questioning.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.315
Hanna, if there's anything else
you have to say

17:38.350 --> 17:40.284
about the note,
now is the time.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.787
She's not going
to find anything.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.554
I swear,
I didn't write it.

17:48.330 --> 17:50.867
"Good cop, bad cop,"
I thought that would do the job,

17:50.900 --> 17:53.130
but she's one_
tough little cookie.

17:53.170 --> 17:54.296
I kind of like her.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.729
We arrested her mother
and we were wrong.

17:56.770 --> 17:57.907
And we put that family
through hell.

17:57.940 --> 18:01.603
My gut tells me that she's
trying to do the same thing.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.198
She's giving us
the runaround.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.569
I know this girl.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.202
Something doesn't jive.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.241
I think that note's legit.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.487
You're on your own
with that theory.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.544
But keep an eye on her.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.115
Let's see if she takes this
to one of her friends.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.650
Maybe they're all in on it.

18:22.730 --> 18:23.867
Is that your dad?

18:23.900 --> 18:24.924
Yep.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.768
_ He wants to take me_
into some restaurant tonight,

18:27.800 --> 18:31.236
a little quality
father-daughter time.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.862
Jeremiah's?

18:32.910 --> 18:33.877
Yeah.

18:33.910 --> 18:36.299
How did you know that?

18:36.340 --> 18:38.706
That's the only good
vegetarian place around here.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.245
How do you know
so much about SU?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.588
I thought that you were
from Cedar Rapids.

18:45.620 --> 18:49.511
I am. But my parents
went to school here.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.927
They met on campus in chem lab,
freshman year.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.655
I have three older sisters

18:54.700 --> 18:58.420
and they all graduated
from Syracuse, too.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.823
Summa cum laude.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.804
Let me guess.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.138
You don't want to continue
the tradition?

19:07.410 --> 19:10.299
I got into
Berklee College of Music.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.908
Wow.
That's amazing.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.510
Yeah, well,
my parents don't think

19:14.550 --> 19:16.541
music is the kind of thing
you study.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.420
What about you?

19:24.760 --> 19:26.227
I-- I love music.

19:27.430 --> 19:28.454
You know what I mean.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.799
You clearly didn't come here
to look at a college.

19:35.600 --> 19:41.607
Um, some jerk just broke
my heart into,

19:41.640 --> 19:43.346
like, 30,000 million pieces.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.405
That's a lot.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.213
Tell me about it.

19:50.750 --> 19:54.481
Aanay, so, yeah, he's back home
and that's why I'm here.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.927
Just needed to disappear
for a little bit, I guess.

19:59.630 --> 20:00.995
That doesn't seem right.

20:01.030 --> 20:03.567
He's the jerk,
but you're the one in exile?

20:03.600 --> 20:05.488
Shouldn't it be
the other way around?

20:08.470 --> 20:10.802
Not that I'm complaining
or anything.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.398
Yeah, you better not be.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.369
I can finish this.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.480
Why don't you go up
and put your laundry away?

20:24.520 --> 20:25.714
Okay.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.215
Thanks.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.025
( knocking on door)

20:33.060 --> 20:34.618
I'll get it.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.369
Spencen

20:39.400 --> 20:41.334
Veronica, may I come in?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.689
I was just stopping
by to see

20:42.740 --> 20:44.605
if you got the flyer
I left in your mailbox

20:44.640 --> 20:47.939
about the bridal show
fund-raiser.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.038
I did.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.469
I didn't get your RSVP.

20:51.510 --> 20:54.047
Oh. I'll have
to check the calendar.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.342
I'll be right back.

20:58.650 --> 20:59.878
You're looking well.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.358
Your mother told me
that you had a bug.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.381
Your outburst at my home
was a reaction

21:05.430 --> 21:07.250
to some ov_er-t_he-counter
medication?

21:08.360 --> 21:10.396
Yeah, yeah.

21:10.430 --> 21:12.864
Next time I'll be sure
to buy name brand.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.637
I'm so sorry for everything
that I said

21:18.670 --> 21:20.774
and for the way
that I grabbed you.

21:20.810 --> 21:22.607
I really was not myself.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.948
No apology necessary.

21:28.780 --> 21:31.442
My guess is
she's in there writing a check.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.378
I wouldn't expect her
to attend.

21:33.420 --> 21:34.887
But it's all for
a good cause.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.059
You know, the charity feeds
starving children.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.521
No mother should have
to watch her child die.

21:44.430 --> 21:48.491
Um, I should probably
just take my laundry up

21:48.540 --> 21:50.405
and go to bed.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.759
Nothing beats
a good night's sleep

21:51.810 --> 21:53.732
on a set of fresh,
clean sheets.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.070
I'm sorry, Jessica.

21:57.110 --> 21:58.748
We have another commitment
that night.

22:00.550 --> 22:01.676
I hope this helps.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.883
Thank you.
I so appreciate your generosity.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.610
Goodbye, Spencer.

22:14.730 --> 22:15.924
( knocking on door)

22:20.130 --> 22:23.531
Well,
you sure do look nice.

22:23.570 --> 22:24.935
You ready
for our last big day?

22:24.970 --> 22:28.030
I actually just came by
to let you know

22:28.080 --> 22:29.707
I'm gonna cut out early.

22:29.740 --> 22:31.571
Head back home.

22:31.610 --> 22:34.340
Maybe take Antonio
on the scenic route.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.041
You're gonna go talk
to your folks about Berklee?

22:39.720 --> 22:40.880
That's the plan.

22:42.620 --> 22:46.522
Look, I just wanted to say,

22:46.560 --> 22:49.597
I thought this was gonna be
a pretty unbearable week

22:49.630 --> 22:54.033
and it ended up
being pretty great.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.959
So thank you.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.442
You should find me
if you're ever in Rosewood.

23:11.820 --> 23:12.912
Count on it.

23:20.230 --> 23:21.424
Bye.

23:26.670 --> 23:27.796
Thank you.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.932
Hi.

23:28.970 --> 23:31.632
Hey.
Have you talked to Aria?

23:31.670 --> 23:32.898
Not today. Why?

23:32.940 --> 23:35.807
She's not answering
any of my calls or texts.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.842
Look, if you hear from her,
tell her I said, "thanks."

23:37.880 --> 23:38.972
Mike, hold on.

23:39.010 --> 23:40.944
Can you take over for a sec?

23:40.980 --> 23:41.969
Thanks.

23:44.890 --> 23:45.914
What's going on?

23:45.950 --> 23:47.087
Aria got what she wanted.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.650
Mona dumped me this morning.

23:49.690 --> 23:52.750
I got a text really
early that said we're done.

23:52.790 --> 23:53.791
Just like that.

23:53.830 --> 23:55.593
Okay,
I'm sorry that happened

23:55.630 --> 23:57.029
but I don't think
Aria was involved.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.493
Oh, so the fact
that you guys can't stand her

23:58.530 --> 23:59.895
has nothing
to do with it?

24:01.700 --> 24:03.759
I can't think
of another reason

24:03.810 --> 24:05.562
why Mona would
just cut me off like a wart.

24:06.710 --> 24:08.507
Maybe I could talk to her.

24:08.540 --> 24:09.632
Find out what's going on.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.977
Whatever.

24:12.580 --> 24:13.979
Just tell Aria to call me.

24:34.870 --> 24:37.998
Hey, we just did 3 loops,
that's 3 miles.

24:38.040 --> 24:38.904
And now we're doing
an extra loop

24:38.940 --> 24:41.579
for your little phone stunt
yesterday.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.101
God, why are you so mean,
Dean?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.708
Because you make me tense,
Spence.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.149
I mean how long are
you gonna keep this up?

24:47.180 --> 24:48.943
Rhyming?
I could go all day.

24:48.980 --> 24:49.969
Look”.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.513
I can see _
that you're a smart girl

24:53.560 --> 24:55.755
with a sharp tongue,
and you love to spar.

24:56.990 --> 24:59.083
But getting under my skin
isn't the goal here.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.155
It's getting under yours
so we can address

25:01.200 --> 25:02.599
what's really going on.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.421
Do you have
any interest in that?

25:09.300 --> 25:11.200
One more mile.
Let's go.

25:25.050 --> 25:26.517
Damn it, Ali,
I said stop it.

25:51.810 --> 25:54.608
Hey, hey,
take a deep breath.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.217
Now tell me
what's g0ing on.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.822
I think I know what I did.

26:25.280 --> 26:30.047
Do you ever think that
sometimes people see you

26:30.080 --> 26:31.945
more clearly than
you see yourself?

26:31.990 --> 26:34.151
I'm not sure
what you mean.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.155
There are things
that happened

26:40.190 --> 26:45.822
that I don't remember
and other people do.

26:47.170 --> 26:50.958
And you're using their memories
to fill in the blanks?

26:51.010 --> 26:51.863
Yeah.
What else can I do?

26:54.140 --> 26:57.177
Well, maybe recalling
what really happened

26:57.210 --> 26:59.246
is a little too much to wrap
your head around right now.

27:02.750 --> 27:05.389
I mean I should have known

27:05.420 --> 27:07.411
that I was capable
of something like this.

27:07.450 --> 27:09.782
I've done bad things before.

27:09.820 --> 27:10.582
Wait.

27:10.620 --> 27:13.657
Look, before you go
to that place,

27:13.700 --> 27:15.850
I want you to look at what
happened today as a positive.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.721
It sounds like to me,
at least emotionally,

27:19.770 --> 27:22.034
you're ready to take
responsibility for your actions.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.799
You want to know
what you did,

27:24.840 --> 27:26.432
maybe make good
on a few things.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.871
How am I supposed
to take responsibility?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.006
I mean if I--
ifI really did this.

27:33.050 --> 27:34.915
Did what, Spencer?

27:41.860 --> 27:44.920
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm sorry.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.689
I'm really talked-out
right now.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.068
I think
we've covered enough.

27:54.870 --> 28:00.069
I'm gonna give you some space
so you can read that.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.358
Just so you know,
I'm a picker.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.334
So whatever I order,

28:29.370 --> 28:31.099
the other person's plate
always looks better.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.335
What does that even mean?

28:33.370 --> 28:36.703
It means whatever you order,
get a side of garlic bread.

28:39.510 --> 28:40.943
Hanna?

28:40.980 --> 28:42.379
Hi, Mrs. D.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.115
Don't you look
lovely tonight?

28:46.290 --> 28:47.712
Are we on a date?

28:49.020 --> 28:51.454
Yeah. Yeah.
This is Travis.

28:53.530 --> 28:54.849
Nice to meet you.

28:56.330 --> 28:57.729
Such a gentleman.

28:59.870 --> 29:01.132
I won't keep you.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.398
You two enjoy yourselves.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.902
WOMAN:
Mrs. DiLaurentis?

29:08.940 --> 29:10.100
Lieutenant Tanner.

29:10.140 --> 29:11.300
Detective Holbrook.

29:13.010 --> 29:14.773
Please come with us.

29:16.350 --> 29:19.319
I'm sorry.
This will just take one moment.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.428
Uh, so if you want
the garlic bread,

29:24.460 --> 29:26.018
maybe I should order
the lasagna.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.264
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.312
I need to talk to you.

29:52.350 --> 29:53.886
I have somewhere to be.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.785
Going to meet
with Ezra Fitz?

29:58.590 --> 29:59.818
Get in.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.788
( knocking on door)

30:14.480 --> 30:15.902
Aria.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.168
Can I come in?

30:26.490 --> 30:27.616
Why would you help him?

30:27.650 --> 30:30.585
I'm surprised it took you
this long to figure it out.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.453
And I kind of expected
it would be Aria.

30:33.490 --> 30:35.856
He should have told her
about the book a long time ago.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.198
When did you find out?

30:38.230 --> 30:40.425
Around the time
I bought Jenna's car.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.995
But I didn't want to help him
with his tattle-tale,

30:43.040 --> 30:44.632
I wanted to stop him.

30:44.670 --> 30:47.264
Or at least, stop the parts
that included me,

30:47.310 --> 30:50.336
some of the stuff I did,
I could still go to jail for.

30:50.380 --> 30:52.075
So we made a deal.

30:52.110 --> 30:53.975
I would answer questions
about my exploits,

30:54.020 --> 30:58.514
and he'd edit out anything I did
that was less than legal.

30:59.590 --> 31:00.989
Did you read the book?

31:01.020 --> 31:02.487
Do you know
what it says about Alison?

31:02.520 --> 31:04.579
If Alison were alive,

31:04.630 --> 31:05.983
I'm sure she'd love being

31:06.030 --> 31:08.999
the focus of
a scandalous page-turner.

31:09.030 --> 31:11.191
But no, Ezra only showed me
parts of chapters

31:11.230 --> 31:13.061
I was written into.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.294
I never saw
the whole thing.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.532
I didn't come here
to hash things out.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.049
I came here to tell you
that you need to leave.

31:27.180 --> 31:30.479
Yeah, I understand
you need your space.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.647
No, I don't think
that you understand.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.112
I do.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.116
I spoke
with Hackett yesterday

31:36.160 --> 31:37.411
and I'm taking
a leave of absence.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.449
No, Ezra.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.024
You need to leave town.
For good.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.963
Aria, we can work
through this.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.534
I don't want to work
through this.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.572
_ I don't want to run
into you at the grocery

31:54.610 --> 31:56.305
or every time I grab coffee
with my friends

31:56.340 --> 31:57.409
I don't want to see you.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.544
I don't want to hear from you.
Even

32:04.350 --> 32:06.181
So you dated Mike
to get closer to Aria,

32:06.220 --> 32:08.108
so you could spy on her.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.481
Mike's a really sweet guy.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.987
I fell for him.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.692
When you guys started
to catch on,

32:15.730 --> 32:17.459
I tried to tell Fitz
I wanted out.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.195
He said
that wasn't an option.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.639
I didn't want to drag Mike
into my mess, so I let him go.

32:26.140 --> 32:27.562
You went through
all that and got nothing?

32:27.610 --> 32:29.100
Not nothing.

32:29.140 --> 32:32.303
It's murky, but it's big.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.016
Remember,
after the lodge burned down,

32:37.050 --> 32:38.608
I told you all that someone
stole the game from me

32:38.650 --> 32:39.685
when I was in Radley?

32:39.720 --> 32:41.312
We all thought
it was CeCe.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.588
I never found out.

32:42.620 --> 32:46.488
But whoever it is,
Ezra thinks he knows.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.491
This is a copy of
my manuscript.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.428
Thanks, but I think I'll wait
till it's in the clearance bin.

32:57.670 --> 32:59.160
I really think you
should read it.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.479
I found some stuff out
that can really help you.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.472
And for what it's worth,

33:10.520 --> 33:13.614
I was in New York returning
my publisher's advance.

33:13.650 --> 33:15.356
Ithought
ifI pulled the plug--

33:15.390 --> 33:16.379
It's too late, Ezra.

33:24.630 --> 33:26.689
Well, I guess
this is good-bye then.

33:39.180 --> 33:42.638
* Go ahead
and break my heart *

33:42.680 --> 33:45.080
* You had me
from the start *

33:45.120 --> 33:48.681
* And I know you know

33:51.160 --> 33:54.152
* Go ahead
and let me down *

33:54.200 --> 33:57.249
* I'm better off alone

33:57.300 --> 34:00.667
* And you know I know

34:00.700 --> 34:03.567
* You know I know it

34:03.600 --> 34:09.539
* Still you hold me
like I'm your only *

34:09.580 --> 34:14.119
* Make me wonder
how I could let you go *

34:14.150 --> 34:15.572
( cellphone vibrating )

34:15.620 --> 34:17.611
* Yours completely

34:17.650 --> 34:23.816
* Can't you see me
chasing after you *

34:23.860 --> 34:27.421
* Till I can run no more

34:27.460 --> 34:32.329
* Honey, honey,
why you got to be so cruel *

34:33.730 --> 34:34.628
I'm about
to kill this dessert.

34:34.670 --> 34:36.399
You'd better jump in
if you want a bite.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.532
Oh, no, you can finish it.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.170
Something wrong?

34:43.210 --> 34:44.245
Look, Travis, I'm so sorry.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.269
I've got to go.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.449
Can I please
just pay for my half?

34:47.480 --> 34:49.516
I don't go Dutch
on the first date.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.687
You sure everything's okay?

34:53.720 --> 34:55.358
Do you want me
to drop you somewhere?

34:55.390 --> 34:57.153
No, it's just a friend.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.518
I knew something was up.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.425
You've been distracted
almost the whole night.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.860
And it's not just
since that text came in.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.424
I'm just a little rusty.

35:07.470 --> 35:09.734
It's been a while since
I've been on a date.

35:09.770 --> 35:10.794
( cellphone chiming )

35:13.640 --> 35:14.834
Come on,
this wasn't a date.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.836
Your phone makes
a lousy third wheel.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.541
Look, it won't happen again,
I promise.

35:18.580 --> 35:21.310
I just--
I really have to go.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.220
Thanks.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.623
Look, I know
it didn't seem like it,

35:39.670 --> 35:41.490
but I had
a really great time.

35:48.410 --> 35:51.277
So you think that Mona
left that anonymous tip?

35:51.310 --> 35:53.301
Well, if she was upset
that she had to dump Mike,

35:53.350 --> 35:54.817
maybe she was
trying to make Fitz pay.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.380
It could all lead
back to Ezra.

35:59.450 --> 36:00.587
It might stop him
from publishing

36:00.620 --> 36:01.689
while they investigate.

36:04.290 --> 36:06.520
Em, how long
has this been there?

36:06.560 --> 36:08.551
What-- What are you
talking about?

36:08.600 --> 36:09.897
The blue envelope.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.494
It's a note from Paige.
Why?

36:15.440 --> 36:16.395
Sorry.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.260
_ I had to finish
reading it to be sure, but--

36:19.410 --> 36:21.503
Ezra gave me
a copy of his book.

36:21.540 --> 36:22.768
You talked to him?

36:22.810 --> 36:24.277
Mona dumped your brother,

36:24.310 --> 36:25.447
and he thinks
you made her do it,

36:25.480 --> 36:26.572
but really it was
because of Ezra.

36:26.610 --> 36:29.272
Sorry. Housekeeping.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.538
Yeah, I'll deal with that.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.252
You're back.
Are you better?

36:36.260 --> 36:38.524
Better, yeah,
but it's your SOS,

36:38.560 --> 36:39.549
so why don't you go first?

36:40.660 --> 36:43.959
Okay, there is something
that Ezra wanted us to know.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.922
I thought you went to Syracuse
to get away from him?

36:45.970 --> 36:47.198
What changed?

36:48.800 --> 36:51.769
I-- I just figured out how to
say what needed to be said.

36:51.810 --> 36:52.731
And then he gave me
a copy of his book.

36:52.770 --> 36:54.829
You guys, you're never going
to believe this,

36:54.880 --> 36:58.600
but Ezra thinks
that "A" is Ali's mom.

37:08.420 --> 37:11.526
Are you sure that's what it says
that Mrs. DiLaurentis is "A"?

37:11.560 --> 37:13.619
That's ridiculous.
How old is she?

37:13.660 --> 37:15.321
Does she even know
how to text?

37:15.360 --> 37:17.453
"A" has been telling us
to stop going after Alison

37:17.500 --> 37:19.866
probably because "A"
wants to bring her home.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.595
But that's exactly
what we've been trying to do.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.609
Why would Mrs. DiLaurentis think
that we were in the way?

37:26.640 --> 37:28.676
Maybe because she thinks
I tried to kill Ali.

37:32.050 --> 37:35.019
When did Ali's mom accuse
you of attempted murder?

37:36.380 --> 37:38.519
And why are you
just now telling us this?

37:38.550 --> 37:39.881
Look, the other night
I found a bunch of dirt

37:39.920 --> 37:40.944
in the bottom of my bed

37:40.990 --> 37:43.982
and Ali's mom made _
some cryptic comment about it.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.726
Don't pin that on her.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.557
I mean that sounds
like an "A" move.

37:47.590 --> 37:48.818
Which is why I think
she's "A."

37:48.860 --> 37:51.522
Mrs. D being "A" makes
about as much sense

37:51.570 --> 37:53.993
as you whacking All
over the head with a shovel.

37:55.670 --> 37:57.399
I could have.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.658
CeCe told Ezra that both
she and Mrs. DiLaurentis

37:59.710 --> 38:01.769
saw me pick up a shovel
and go after Ali.

38:01.810 --> 38:04.973
But Alison is still alive.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.705
We argued that night,
okay.

38:06.750 --> 38:09.048
And we'd all been drinking
but I was also on amphetamines.

38:09.080 --> 38:12.516
I don't remember anything and
lately I've been seeing things.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.689
I don't know if it's just me
coming off of the drugs

38:14.720 --> 38:16.654
_ or if it is_
a gUIlty conSCIence.

38:16.690 --> 38:17.816
But if two people saw me--

38:17.860 --> 38:19.487
Why believe anything
CeCe says?

38:19.530 --> 38:20.986
Because it wasn't just CeCe.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.657
Ezra put it in his book,
okay.

38:22.700 --> 38:23.928
He thinks that one of us
tried to kill her

38:23.960 --> 38:26.428
and that person
is probably me.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.439
The only person that knows
what really happened is Alison.

38:29.470 --> 38:32.530
Yeah, and she's not here
to help us, is she?

38:34.610 --> 38:35.804
I can't talk
about this anymore.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.603
I'm gonna get a snack.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.107
Somebody want anything?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.447
Yeah, sure.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.469
I'm not hungry.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.669
I'll come with you.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.109
Hey, Em,
can I ask you something?

38:47.150 --> 38:48.185
We don't have
any cheesy puffs.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.415
My mom says the orange powder
has chemicals in it

38:50.460 --> 38:51.484
that make you break out.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.124
No, it's--
look, it's important

38:54.160 --> 38:56.754
and I need you to tell me
the truth.

39:00.730 --> 39:03.563
You told Paige that
Alison's alive, didn't you?

39:14.850 --> 39:17.410
Dad put some leftovers
in the fridge for you.

39:20.490 --> 39:21.752
I ate 'em.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.485
It's fine,
I had something at Emily's.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.530
I heard about Mona.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.029
Mike, I'm really sorry.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.372
I know how much it hurts.

39:46.110 --> 39:47.577
You know
that I would never--

39:47.610 --> 39:48.645
I know.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.015
It was just
easier to blame you

39:53.050 --> 39:55.712
than admit you were
right all along.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.182
Maybe about this.

39:57.220 --> 40:00.724
But there are
plenty of other things

40:00.760 --> 40:01.795
that I'm wrong about.

40:16.610 --> 40:18.749
Are we going to have to lock you
in your room at night?

40:20.080 --> 40:21.104
Mom, I'm sorry.

40:21.150 --> 40:22.777
It was
really, really important.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.180
More important
than staying sober?

40:26.220 --> 40:27.517
No.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.188
Were you out
looking for drugs?

40:29.220 --> 40:30.209
What? Mom, no.

40:30.260 --> 40:31.454
The drawer was open.

40:31.490 --> 40:32.718
Did you--
give me your phone.

40:38.930 --> 40:40.067
What does "SOS" mean?

40:40.100 --> 40:41.897
And why were you
meeting up at Emily's?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.669
Hanging out
with your friends,

40:43.700 --> 40:45.429
that's what was
so important?

40:46.640 --> 40:48.198
I'm about ready
to throw my hands up.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.832
You keep flirting
with disaster no matter

40:49.880 --> 40:51.074
how hard
we try to protect you.

40:51.110 --> 40:52.509
Maybe you should stop.

40:54.750 --> 40:56.809
It's about a quarter
past sarcasm, Spencer.

40:56.850 --> 40:57.817
You want to try
another tone?

40:57.850 --> 41:00.011
I'm not being sarcastic.

41:00.050 --> 41:01.813
You and Dad said
that you covered for me

41:01.860 --> 41:04.988
that summer _
when I was first usmg.

41:05.030 --> 41:05.985
What did you mean?

41:06.030 --> 41:07.486
Because I still
don't remember.

41:09.030 --> 41:10.224
Consider it a blessing.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.194
I'm going to bed.

41:13.230 --> 41:15.232
I suggest you do the same.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.126
Spencer?

41:46.970 --> 41:47.959
Spencer?

41:49.640 --> 41:50.959
Are you okay?

42:04.180 --> 42:07.786
* Hey, little sister,
what have you done *

42:11.630 --> 42:15.919
* Hey, little sister,
who is the only one *

42:19.330 --> 42:23.630
* Hey, little sister,
who's your superman *

42:23.670 --> 42:27.299
* Hey, little sister,
who's the one you want *

42:27.340 --> 42:30.901
* Hey, little sister,
shotgun *

42:30.940 --> 42:36.640
* It's a nice day
for a white wedding *
