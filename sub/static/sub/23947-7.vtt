00:37.162 --> 00:37.996
Koku!

00:39.456 --> 00:43.001
Where have you been?
I've been waiting so long.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.668
Yuna.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.592
Yuna!

01:33.427 --> 01:35.095
Give her back!

01:42.019 --> 01:43.145
You know what to do?

01:43.228 --> 01:45.897
We just need to avoid his heart
and head, right?

02:09.463 --> 02:10.714
Yuna.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.666
Are they ready?

03:27.749 --> 03:28.834
Just give the word.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.042
Give back Yuna!

04:11.877 --> 04:13.170
Give her back!

04:16.423 --> 04:17.507
You're so pathetic.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.593
Haul them up.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.432
Minatsuki!

05:18.610 --> 05:20.403
Stop! Don't kill him.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.908
Minatsuki, we need to withdraw.

05:25.116 --> 05:28.119
If it's not treated immediately,
it'll become irreversible.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.289
Minatsuki! Hey! Are you listening to me?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.917
Minatsuki! Minatsuki!

05:44.719 --> 05:45.637
Canopus.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.434
Koku!

05:52.102 --> 05:53.186
Are you all right?

06:20.213 --> 06:24.801
TO MY SON, KEITH

06:24.884 --> 06:30.682
13 WILL SENSE THE PART OF ME WITHIN YOU.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.477
HE WILL FIND HIS WAY TO YOU

06:35.020 --> 06:37.856
PLEASE GUIDE HIM

07:09.387 --> 07:11.348
Whose fault is it that we lost?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.350
Yeah, whose?

07:13.975 --> 07:16.269
Weaklings like you don't belong here!

07:17.145 --> 07:18.063
Who threw that?

07:20.899 --> 07:22.192
Leave Yuna alone!

07:29.574 --> 07:30.742
You see?

07:30.825 --> 07:33.870
The instant Yuna starts crying,
he comes running.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.871
You're right!

07:36.456 --> 07:37.332
So cool!

07:37.540 --> 07:40.085
Come to my rescue, sir knight!

08:01.106 --> 08:03.566
Kirisame
and the other boys carried you in.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.986
Be sure to thank them later.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.537
They're always making fun of us.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.373
Is that so?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.083
I don't get it.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.460
Everyone is so strong,

08:23.169 --> 08:26.798
but all I have is my left eye,
and I'm not supposed to use it.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.342
What am I even doing here?

08:30.301 --> 08:31.177
Koku.

08:32.095 --> 08:37.433
Having superior physical abilities
or special powers doesn't make you strong.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.562
I've told you this before.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.399
Grown-ups all say stuff like that.
It's nothing but pretty words.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.277
You have to be strong to protect people.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.197
I suppose you might be right about that.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.659
But then again,
it might just be that you aren't.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.288
Well, you'll probably understand one day.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.375
But for now,
it's important to ponder such things.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.343
Thanks.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.972
You helped me out earlier, remember?

09:16.514 --> 09:18.933
Yeah... I did. And?

09:19.684 --> 09:20.518
And?

09:20.852 --> 09:22.520
-That's all?
-That's all.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.191
You could have said that at school!

09:26.775 --> 09:28.985
You didn't have to drag me out here.

09:29.194 --> 09:32.655
We'll be teased again
if we're seen together at school, right?

09:32.739 --> 09:34.074
Nobody teases me!

09:35.033 --> 09:39.037
Tell me,
why do you keep trying to help me?

09:39.662 --> 09:42.457
Why? Can't you tell?

09:44.459 --> 09:49.172
I don't know why, but when you feel sad,
I feel something, too.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.548
That's why.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.842
You do it to protect me, you mean?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.010
Is that weird?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.851
Then I'll protect you, too.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.731
Whenever you're feeling sad,
I'll put a smile on your face.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.279
I had a great idea.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.365
Look at this.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.953
All of us here have special numbers.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.622
You're "four."

10:23.289 --> 10:24.999
But not the normal "four."

10:25.708 --> 10:28.128
You're a special four
that's only for you.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.296
One that's only used for time.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.465
And I'm "13."

10:33.383 --> 10:35.218
And if you combine them...

10:37.178 --> 10:39.264
Let's use this as our special signal.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.309
Next time you're being teased,
draw this where I'll see it.

10:43.768 --> 10:47.147
And then I'll come running and help you!

10:47.730 --> 10:51.442
And when I draw it, you come and help me!

10:52.569 --> 10:55.280
'Kay. But will you really come?

10:55.738 --> 10:56.573
Of course!

10:57.073 --> 10:58.658
And I'll come for sure, too!

11:00.577 --> 11:01.703
Hold yours out, too.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.250
Promise!

11:25.226 --> 11:26.060
Yuna!

11:34.611 --> 11:35.528
Yuna!

11:36.237 --> 11:37.071
Koku?

11:37.447 --> 11:38.281
Yuna!

11:38.740 --> 11:39.574
Kirisame.

11:40.575 --> 11:44.704
Take Koku to this place
instead of the shelter.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.373
No one else knows about it.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.125
You'll be safe there.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.008
Koku?

11:58.760 --> 12:00.261
What are you doing here?

12:00.595 --> 12:02.430
Go with Kirisame. Hurry.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.723
But Yuna is--

12:04.390 --> 12:07.852
I know. I'll do what I can for Yuna.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.646
-So get moving.
-But I--

12:11.773 --> 12:14.817
Kirisame, keep Koku safe no matter what.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.124
Koku, where are you? I'm scared!

12:33.586 --> 12:34.420
Yuna!

12:36.381 --> 12:37.215
Koku!

12:49.102 --> 12:51.145
Who are you?

12:51.771 --> 12:52.730
I'm Minatsuki.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.274
Koku is my little brother.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.235
Come with me.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.779
It's not safe here anymore.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.281
Koku's waiting for us.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.283
He is?

13:16.087 --> 13:16.921
Yuna!

13:17.463 --> 13:18.631
Keep moving!

13:19.298 --> 13:20.633
But Yuna might...

13:20.800 --> 13:23.845
If anything happens,
we have to go to the shelter.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.930
I'm sure everybody's there!

13:26.097 --> 13:28.016
Yuna will catch up, so come on!

13:28.433 --> 13:29.267
'Kay.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.155
Minatsuki! Izanami!

13:42.905 --> 13:44.532
You're safe? Thank goodness!

13:46.242 --> 13:49.954
Get to the shelter right away.
The enemy's closing in, so--

13:55.585 --> 13:57.545
So it was you people all along...

13:58.171 --> 13:59.422
Market Maker.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.260
You're...

14:12.393 --> 14:13.227
Minatsuki.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.522
You're the devil.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.282
I will never become his spare parts.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.372
So that rumor really was true, then?

14:34.082 --> 14:34.916
Where's Koku?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.668
Don't let him deceive you.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.630
Minatsuki, he's--

14:42.799 --> 14:44.175
Goodbye, Canopus.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.103
Almost there!

14:59.649 --> 15:00.942
-Is this it?
-Yeah.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.243
I'll hold them off here!

15:10.618 --> 15:12.078
Lock yourself inside!

15:12.161 --> 15:13.162
-But--
-Koku!

15:14.038 --> 15:16.290
Listen, you're our king!

15:16.999 --> 15:18.835
You mustn't die here!

15:19.669 --> 15:20.503
Kirisame.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.880
I'll be right behind you!

15:22.964 --> 15:23.798
No!

15:24.173 --> 15:25.383
Kirisame, come with me!

15:25.633 --> 15:27.093
No more talk! Get moving!

15:30.596 --> 15:31.806
Koku! Run!

15:36.519 --> 15:37.854
I'll see you soon.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.355
Just wait in there.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.513
Yuna.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.223
I'm sorry!

16:18.227 --> 16:19.061
Koku?

16:22.190 --> 16:23.024
Yuna?

16:24.984 --> 16:25.860
Yuna!

16:26.652 --> 16:27.737
Yuna!

16:28.821 --> 16:29.697
Yuna!

16:31.574 --> 16:32.783
-Yuna!
-Koku?

16:35.286 --> 16:36.329
Is that you, Koku?

16:37.371 --> 16:38.206
Canopus!

16:41.626 --> 16:43.211
Thank goodness you're safe.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.674
You have to get away from here.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.510
I can't. I can't do that!

16:51.177 --> 16:53.346
I can't run and leave everyone else!

16:54.180 --> 16:55.014
Koku.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.684
You have a duty to survive.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.229
You owe it to the others.

17:11.071 --> 17:11.948
What is it?

17:12.781 --> 17:16.077
Everything you need to know about yourself
is on these pages.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.079
As well as what you must do next.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.290
Now, get going.

17:27.003 --> 17:27.838
Koku!

17:30.049 --> 17:32.093
You're able to resonate with Yuna.

17:33.511 --> 17:36.222
Find her and protect her no matter what.

17:50.111 --> 17:50.945
Keith.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.951
That boy will find his way to you.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.082
Guide him.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.338
Koku.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.592
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

18:56.969 --> 18:59.055
<i>I'll protect him.</i>

19:01.223 --> 19:02.642
<i>Be brave.</i>

19:04.185 --> 19:07.772
<i>Assimilate them into yourself
<i>and become the black-winged king.</i></i>

19:10.399 --> 19:12.860
<i>As long as you and Yuna remain alive,</i>

19:13.861 --> 19:17.448
<i>their memories will carry on
<i>through the ages.</i></i>

19:19.867 --> 19:20.910
<i>-Wake up.
<i>-Get up.</i></i>

19:21.118 --> 19:23.704
<i>-Our king.
<i>-The time has come.</i></i>

19:32.338 --> 19:33.798
You took quite a beating.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.759
Don't push yourself yet. Get some sleep.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.722
-I'll make coffee later-- Oh, I can't yet.
-My pants.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.436
They're here,
but they're way too torn up to wear.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.314
-My pants pocket.
-Pocket?

19:55.236 --> 19:58.239
I'm glad you said something
before I threw these out.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.156
That day,

20:00.408 --> 20:03.828
I chose to block every memory I had
except for those of Yuna.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.539
My left eye...

20:07.248 --> 20:09.458
has the ability to manipulate memories.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.672
I was always told
never to use it on others.

20:15.506 --> 20:18.509
So, I rewrote my own memories.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.179
To avoid the feelings of guilt
for what I did.

20:23.055 --> 20:28.060
But when I looked in her eyes,
I remembered everything.

20:29.687 --> 20:33.733
ROYAL POLICE, CHIEF OF POLICE'S OFFICE

20:34.942 --> 20:36.652
You still haven't found him?

20:37.862 --> 20:40.781
All precincts are currently cooperating
to conduct an exhaustive search.

20:42.700 --> 20:47.788
I authorized Keith Flick's return because
you said you'd take full responsibility.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.749
I can offer no excuse.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.418
Enough. I'll give you 24 hours.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.837
Locate Flick within that time.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.382
If you fail,
the RIS will be immediately disbanded.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.009
Is that clear?

21:11.479 --> 21:15.816
It's entirely possible that
he's deliberately slowing down the search.

21:16.734 --> 21:20.404
But this will force his hand
and make him genuinely apply himself.

21:21.155 --> 21:24.033
You see,
the RIS means more than anything to him.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.912
Someone else would take over the manhunt,
of course,

21:28.287 --> 21:31.332
but if anyone is going to locate Flick,
it's that man.

21:32.374 --> 21:36.212
I've created access rights
for you to read his and his team's files.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.839
Please make free use of our system.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.134
That will be helpful.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.722
You told us!

21:47.431 --> 21:49.058
That we're imitation gods!

21:49.517 --> 21:52.019
Meant to be sacrificed
to prevent his destruction.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.648
That no one could harm us
except the black-winged king!

22:01.946 --> 22:04.073
Why? Why did this happen?

22:08.369 --> 22:09.578
Stop!

22:18.546 --> 22:23.133
You're the one true prophet, the only one
who managed to decipher the inscription!

22:25.386 --> 22:30.015
The one and only person who knows the past
and can foresee the future!

22:30.849 --> 22:33.936
Aren't you the one
who was to lead us to the new world?

22:36.230 --> 22:37.273
Aren't you?

22:40.442 --> 22:43.612
Why? Why don't you answer me?

22:46.699 --> 22:47.575
Regulus.
