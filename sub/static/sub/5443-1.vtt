00:59.550 --> 01:01.404
If he can hold this pace...

01:01.485 --> 01:04.807
Prefontaine will own
the NCAA indoor record.

01:14.364 --> 01:17.288
Here are the 5,000 meter
final results;

01:17.367 --> 01:21.792
First place with a new American
record, Steve Prefontaine.

01:29.779 --> 01:35.069
No one within 60 yards as
Pre wins his 21st straight win.

02:04.947 --> 02:08.598
Pre turned distance running
into a blood sport.

02:13.221 --> 02:16.577
You want to know what he meant
to folks around here?

02:16.657 --> 02:19.876
What was it the hippie kids
used to say back then?

02:19.961 --> 02:22.077
You just had to be there.

02:43.283 --> 02:47.299
We raised Steve the way most
folks in Coos Bay raised their kids.

02:47.387 --> 02:52.871
We just tried to give him the kind of
life that we never had growing up.

02:52.959 --> 02:56.747
But Steve was a
different kind of kid.

02:58.065 --> 03:02.286
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

03:02.369 --> 03:05.850
13, 14, 15...

03:05.939 --> 03:08.954
16, 17, 18...

03:09.042 --> 03:13.228
19, 20, 21, 22...

03:13.312 --> 03:15.098
23, 24...

03:15.181 --> 03:19.402
- You go first. - It's Buck's turn.
I went first yesterday.

03:19.485 --> 03:21.407
That was off the
dinky little bridge.

03:21.487 --> 03:23.637
What's the matter?
Are you scared, Buck?

03:23.722 --> 03:25.644
What the hell is Pre doing?

03:25.724 --> 03:27.646
How'd he get up there?

03:27.726 --> 03:29.739
Go ahead, Pre, jump.

03:29.829 --> 03:32.389
- Yeah. Go, Pre!
- Shut up!

03:37.369 --> 03:40.087
Come down, Pre, before you
get yourself killed.

03:51.049 --> 03:53.005
- Cool!
- My God!

03:54.252 --> 03:57.540
Yeah! Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

03:59.090 --> 04:00.910
- You ready to play?
- Yeah!

04:00.992 --> 04:02.948
Okay. Dick's catcher.
Bobby, take second.

04:03.027 --> 04:05.916
Jimmy, center field.
Buck, you're my pitcher.

04:05.997 --> 04:09.545
Pre.
First sub in.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.555
Jeff, third base.
Joe, right field.

04:11.635 --> 04:14.251
- You'll get in, Pre.
- Let go, Buck.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.386
Let's go, guys.

04:16.473 --> 04:19.430
Take the field, boys.
Let's go!

04:21.310 --> 04:23.791
Pre did love sports, but...

04:23.881 --> 04:26.099
he was like, four-eight.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.107
He weighed 90 pounds.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.303
He had really shaky
hand-eye coordination.

04:34.958 --> 04:37.915
It seemed like the
less he got to play...

04:37.994 --> 04:40.645
the more he felt
he had to prove.

04:40.730 --> 04:44.382
Prefontaine!
Kickoff team!

04:44.467 --> 04:48.563
Go get 'em, Pre!

04:53.709 --> 04:57.293
Go, Pre, go!
Go, Pre, go!

05:50.397 --> 05:53.912
Once he started running,
I guess he never stopped.

06:01.942 --> 06:04.899
Here is Jim Ryun,
beginning to move up now...

06:04.978 --> 06:09.460
This is the race he's been preparing for
since he was a high school sophomore.

06:09.549 --> 06:11.733
I'm going to Munich.

06:11.818 --> 06:15.606
What's that, son?

06:15.688 --> 06:19.579
The Munich Olympics four years
from now? I'm gonna be there.

06:19.659 --> 06:23.243
- In Munich?
- Relax, Elfriede.

06:23.329 --> 06:25.251
Let the boy dream.

06:25.331 --> 06:28.915
- In Germany? - I'm goin' and
nobody's gonna stop me.

06:34.940 --> 06:39.036
First it was football, now this.

06:39.111 --> 06:42.365
Getting up at dawn
to run before school.

06:47.653 --> 06:50.440
I thought that the neighbors
must think...

06:50.522 --> 06:54.174
I'm a crazy German woman
to let my son do this.

06:57.229 --> 06:59.481
Keep your speed constant, Ellie.

06:59.564 --> 07:02.817
I had an itch on my gas foot.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.051
He was my first real boyfriend.

07:06.137 --> 07:08.059
He was hot stuff.

07:10.641 --> 07:14.088
Hey, don't kill me, now.
Come on.

07:14.178 --> 07:19.298
I didn't have any idea what I wanted
to do when I was growing up.

07:20.551 --> 07:22.473
But he knew.

07:25.956 --> 07:29.278
Steve, grab the level and
check this for me, will you?

07:29.360 --> 07:32.647
Ray,your son sure kicked that
North Bend boy's behind last week.

07:32.729 --> 07:37.018
- How bad you beat him?
- Not that bad. Maybe half a lap.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.318
You let him off easy, Ray.

07:39.402 --> 07:43.088
Not my son. Okay, Steve.
Bring that two-by-four over here.

07:43.173 --> 07:45.994
Yeah, keep runnin, 'kid,
so you don't have to spend your life...

07:46.076 --> 07:50.058
shaggin' two-by-fours
for your old man.

07:50.146 --> 07:52.194
All right, hold it steady.

07:55.218 --> 07:59.166
We heard about this small kid
from Coos Bay who could run.

08:00.290 --> 08:02.507
A kid we had to see.
A real fire-eater.

08:21.443 --> 08:24.697
After he broke all those national
high school records...

08:24.780 --> 08:27.203
- college scouts came like
bees to honey. - Uh-uh.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.935
Thanks, Coach.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.977
Steve?

08:37.457 --> 08:39.437
Steve tells me you're
quite an architect.

08:39.527 --> 08:43.280
No, actually,
I'm just a carpenter.

08:43.364 --> 08:45.286
I'll be honest with you, Ray.

08:45.366 --> 08:49.348
Architects... they're
overrated in my book.

08:49.437 --> 08:52.088
Have you seen
Steve's scrapbook?

08:52.173 --> 08:54.459
No, ma'am.
Not, uh...

08:54.542 --> 08:56.999
Not lately.

08:59.946 --> 09:03.063
Steve!

09:10.157 --> 09:12.978
Hello, again, Pre.

09:13.059 --> 09:18.179
- Where's Bowerman? - He sends his
apologies. It's hard for him to get away.

09:18.265 --> 09:22.190
- To make the trip. - Plenty of other
head coaches have gotten away.

09:22.269 --> 09:25.523
- Steve.
- He did ask me, though...

09:25.605 --> 09:28.528
to, uh... give you
a personal letter.

09:28.607 --> 09:30.563
That's all right.
I've got milk crates full of'em.

09:30.643 --> 09:33.032
Come on, son.

09:33.112 --> 09:36.832
Not, uh... like this one.

09:36.916 --> 09:39.771
That's hot off the press.

09:39.852 --> 09:44.573
Dear Pre, If you want to come
to the University of Oregon...

09:44.657 --> 09:46.909
there's no doubt in my mind...

09:46.992 --> 09:49.881
you'll be the greatest
distance runner in the world.

09:49.962 --> 09:52.248
Please, don't wrinkle it, Steve.

09:52.331 --> 09:54.913
I want it for the scrapbook.

10:09.047 --> 10:12.164
No more war! No more war!

10:12.250 --> 10:16.266
Hell, no! We won't go!
Hell, no! We won't go!

10:18.089 --> 10:19.477
# Some folks are born #

10:19.557 --> 10:22.117
# Made to wave the flag #

10:22.193 --> 10:24.047
# Ooh, they're red,
white and blue #

10:24.128 --> 10:27.551
Any question of violence on the
University of Oregon campus...

10:27.631 --> 10:30.919
is in the hands of President Clark and
the police department of Eugene.

10:31.001 --> 10:33.561
If they want violence, they will
start violence. We will not.

10:33.637 --> 10:36.253
I shall take what action
is necessary to end it.

10:36.340 --> 10:39.298
Whether it's disciplinary
or police action.

10:39.376 --> 10:42.823
# It ain't me
It ain't me #

10:47.651 --> 10:51.508
# Some folks are born
silver spoon in hand #

10:54.358 --> 10:57.941
# But when the tax man
comes to the door #

10:58.027 --> 11:02.009
# Now their house looks
like a rummage sale #

11:04.667 --> 11:06.851
He definitely wasn't what
anyone expected.

11:08.104 --> 11:10.026
It's the Beverly Hillbillies.

11:11.507 --> 11:13.395
You've gotta remember,
back then...

11:13.476 --> 11:15.899
most of the best distance
runners on the team...

11:15.978 --> 11:19.095
in the whole country, were these
middle-class or upper-class kids.

11:20.316 --> 11:22.932
Hey, guys.
Steve Prefontaine.

11:23.019 --> 11:24.633
- Hey, I'm Mac.
- Hey, Mac.

11:24.719 --> 11:26.675
Hi. Pat Tyson,
your roommate.

11:26.755 --> 11:28.677
I moved in yesterday.

11:28.757 --> 11:31.681
- Hi, I'm Ellie.
- Ellie Mae?

11:31.760 --> 11:33.682
No,just Ellie.

11:38.466 --> 11:40.821
- Thomas Becker.
- That's right.

11:40.902 --> 11:43.860
Saw you run that 3:57.4
last summer.

11:45.140 --> 11:47.700
- Personal best, right?
- Yeah.

11:47.776 --> 11:52.395
- Man, that was really smokin'.
- I'm flattered.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.165
I'm going to beat
that time this year.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.435
Man, if it wasn't for runnin'...

12:04.525 --> 12:08.074
I'd be dodging bullets in 'Nam
instead of training for Munich.

12:08.162 --> 12:11.643
- Munich. As in Olympics?
Three years from now? - Yeah.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.712
The only way I'm getting to Munich is
if I buy a plane ticket.

12:14.802 --> 12:18.488
- Hey, hey, U.S.A., how many kids
did you kill today? - Look at this.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.790
They'd be the casualties
back in Coos Bay.

12:21.874 --> 12:25.423
Hey, hey, U.S.A., how many kids
did you kill today?

12:25.511 --> 12:28.958
Oops.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.505
Hey, Pre. The sidewalk's
over here. Pre!

12:37.523 --> 12:41.641
- Hey!
- Peace.

12:49.535 --> 12:50.767
Do you realize, Ellie,

12:51.095 --> 12:54.715
that I've been reading about this
place since I was in junior high?

12:54.906 --> 12:57.830
The road to Olympic gold.

12:57.909 --> 13:00.730
Track capitol, U.S.A.

13:00.812 --> 13:03.599
The house that Bowerman built.

13:06.418 --> 13:10.138
You really know how
to sweet-talk a girl.

13:11.923 --> 13:15.438
I'll be coming down
that backstretch...

13:15.527 --> 13:18.416
burning all eight cylinders...

13:18.497 --> 13:23.115
a world record in my hand,
blowing past all the competition...

13:23.200 --> 13:26.715
the crowd cheering me on.

13:28.806 --> 13:31.491
I'll look up in the stands...

13:31.575 --> 13:33.759
and there you'll be.

13:33.844 --> 13:37.268
Yeah, on my way
to the bathroom.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.401
You're dead!

13:47.258 --> 13:50.647
- Always gotta keep me humble, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

13:53.697 --> 13:57.087
Which is why I'm gonna
have to marry you someday.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.147
Yeah. Someday.

14:01.304 --> 14:04.626
Someday soon.

14:05.742 --> 14:09.667
Did I say what field
are we on?

14:09.746 --> 14:13.398
Track capitol, U.S.A.

14:32.301 --> 14:35.281
That's right, you son of a bitch!
You'd better drive away!

14:35.370 --> 14:38.123
Last goddamn time
you'll clip my box!

14:41.043 --> 14:44.592
- Coach Bowerman?
- Don't ever call me "coach".

14:44.680 --> 14:47.261
Had an S.O.B. for a coach.

14:47.348 --> 14:49.327
Still hate that word
to this day.

14:51.652 --> 14:53.574
Um, Mr. Bowerman.

14:53.654 --> 14:56.134
Or "Bill" would be fine.

14:56.224 --> 14:58.306
Come on, rube.
Give me a hand here.

15:01.596 --> 15:05.783
I'm, uh...
I'm Steve Prefontaine.

15:05.867 --> 15:07.880
You don't say, rube.

15:14.876 --> 15:16.797
That's it.
Hold it right there.

15:19.613 --> 15:21.695
Now, what are you doin' here?

15:21.782 --> 15:24.171
I heard you wanted to see me.

15:24.251 --> 15:26.264
I mean, what are you doin'
here at the university?

15:26.353 --> 15:30.107
Well, you said in your letter you'd
make me the best runner in the world.

15:30.190 --> 15:34.286
Letter. You think
I wrote you a letter?

15:38.899 --> 15:40.947
That's dynamite.

15:42.836 --> 15:45.622
Uh-huh.

15:45.704 --> 15:48.787
Just enough to get the
bastard's attention.

16:05.457 --> 16:07.812
Hell of a view, wouldn't you say?

16:07.893 --> 16:09.906
Yeah, it's beautiful.

16:11.931 --> 16:14.717
You know, back home
I have this...

16:14.799 --> 16:18.656
this magazine with a picture of you,
and, uh...

16:18.736 --> 16:20.658
Stay right here.

16:31.916 --> 16:36.068
What are you doing
out there? Bill?

16:36.154 --> 16:39.772
Bill! You better not have
my new waffle iron!

16:39.858 --> 16:41.507
Go! Go!

16:48.799 --> 16:53.782
Why don't you go set down,
and take your shoes and socks off?

16:55.205 --> 16:57.184
So you want to be a miler.

16:57.274 --> 17:00.198
I am a miler.

17:00.277 --> 17:05.294
Funny thing, when I saw you in
Corvallis, you won the two-mile.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.269
Well, I won the mile as well.

17:08.352 --> 17:10.934
But you set a record
in the two-mile.

17:11.021 --> 17:13.772
Give me your foot up here.

17:15.458 --> 17:18.438
I'm going to run a 3:49 here
by my junior year.

17:22.164 --> 17:25.417
That's two seconds
under Ryun's world record.

17:25.501 --> 17:27.856
How you gonna do that, rube?

17:27.936 --> 17:31.361
I'm gonna run three seconds
faster every year.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.193
Well, then I guess we'd better
get started right away.

17:36.279 --> 17:40.170
Tomorrow, 6:00 a. m.,
at the track.

17:46.187 --> 17:48.109
You mind if I ask
what you're doin'?

17:48.189 --> 17:50.749
No, I don't mind at all.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.145
You son of a bitch!

17:56.231 --> 17:57.812
Have some of that.

18:02.237 --> 18:05.855
6:00 a. m., rube.
You ready to run?

18:05.941 --> 18:08.694
- I just need a minute.
- Make sure you're stretched out.

18:08.777 --> 18:13.361
The reason Lord Nelson never lost a battle
was 'cause he showed up 15 minutes early.

18:13.447 --> 18:16.098
You'll be outta here
in less than four.

18:16.183 --> 18:18.663
Can't run without proper shoes.

18:37.404 --> 18:41.123
- Jesus, Bill.
- Hell of a pair of shoes.

18:48.181 --> 18:50.536
You run like a prizefighter, rube.

18:50.616 --> 18:52.766
You mad about somethin'?

18:52.852 --> 18:54.831
Am I mad about something?

18:54.921 --> 18:59.870
I only design 'em to last one race.
Just fell a lap short with that pair.

18:59.959 --> 19:03.247
What was my time?

19:03.329 --> 19:05.251
4:03, give or take.

19:05.331 --> 19:07.253
Pretty good, Pre,
without competition.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.482
And without shoes.

19:09.568 --> 19:12.753
You'll be running in the three-mile
for the team, rube.

19:12.838 --> 19:16.660
- What did you say? - Your kick
is not fast enough for the mile.

19:16.742 --> 19:18.664
I'll prove you wrong.

19:18.744 --> 19:22.134
Doubtful, rube.
Highly doubtful.

19:30.222 --> 19:32.804
Aw,Jesus, Bill.

19:32.891 --> 19:34.870
He'll get over it.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.315
The mile was everything
back then.

19:38.396 --> 19:41.047
The glamour event
of track and field.

19:41.132 --> 19:44.317
Every kid comin' along fool enough
to take up this crazy sport...

19:44.402 --> 19:46.324
wanted to be the next Jim Ryun.

19:46.404 --> 19:49.328
Forget Jim Ryun.
He's done.

19:49.407 --> 19:51.921
I'm gonna be the first
Steve Prefontaine.

19:52.009 --> 19:55.399
It must be nice to
wanna be yourself.

19:55.479 --> 20:00.303
- Like I can't run with him? - Pre,
Becker's the conference mile champ.

20:04.655 --> 20:08.408
Watch it, freshman. There's a
no-race policy during practice.

20:08.491 --> 20:10.413
Fine.
Don't race me, then.

20:33.950 --> 20:35.928
He's a cocky little mother.

20:36.018 --> 20:40.114
I'd like to bottle it and force-feed
it to the rest of you guys.

20:56.171 --> 20:59.561
Wendy Ray. KUGN, live.

20:59.641 --> 21:02.997
Calling the last lap of this
lively twilight meet mile.

21:07.215 --> 21:10.070
Pre is kicking hard
down the homestretch.

21:13.688 --> 21:15.838
Here comes Becker.

21:15.923 --> 21:19.245
It's a battle now between Becker
and the freshman phenom.

21:28.436 --> 21:30.757
Oregon senior Thomas
Becker wins it...

21:30.838 --> 21:33.852
outkicking Steve Prefontaine
down the stretch.

21:44.117 --> 21:46.301
Don't even say it.

21:47.787 --> 21:50.438
You are a damn
fine miler, rube.

21:50.524 --> 21:53.880
I beat him before,
I'll beat him again.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.110
Oh, I know you will.

21:56.196 --> 21:58.118
This isn't about beating Becker.

21:58.198 --> 22:03.646
Becker's never gonna be the best,
and you won't settle for anything less.

22:03.736 --> 22:08.685
With your gas tank and your guts,
you could own the three-mile...

22:08.774 --> 22:10.787
make it your goddamn plaything.

22:10.876 --> 22:14.630
Nobody cares about
the three-mile.

22:14.713 --> 22:17.671
Why don't you give 'em
a reason to care?

22:22.121 --> 22:24.476
Hey, Felix, come here.

22:34.165 --> 22:37.919
Back then, everyone had
either dope or beer.

22:38.002 --> 22:40.891
Pre's drug was winning...
at everything.

22:42.974 --> 22:46.262
# Out here in the field #

22:46.344 --> 22:48.266
# I fought for my meals #

22:48.346 --> 22:52.442
She's beautiful.
I love you! I love you!

22:58.856 --> 23:01.471
# I don't need to fight #

23:03.694 --> 23:06.583
# To prove I'm right #

23:09.032 --> 23:11.648
# I don't need to be forgiven #

23:11.735 --> 23:14.852
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah #

23:19.610 --> 23:23.865
You're the only person
I know who'd buy a gold MG.

23:23.947 --> 23:26.768
What's wrong with a gold MG?

23:26.850 --> 23:28.772
You've got to have a gold
medal to go with it.

23:28.852 --> 23:30.773
Soon enough.

23:34.257 --> 23:37.738
He was like a rocket breaking
free of the Earth's gravity.

23:37.827 --> 23:41.149
- Get down here!
- Nothing could touch him.

23:47.370 --> 23:50.521
- Goddamn it!
- You okay?

23:57.179 --> 24:01.399
Pre is leading the N.C.A.A. final
on a foot with ten stitches in it.

24:10.158 --> 24:13.605
Here comes Bjorkland,
the defending three-mile champion.

24:15.563 --> 24:19.954
Looks like he smells blood,
and Dick Berkeley's going with him.

24:26.474 --> 24:29.453
The freshman, Steve Prefontaine
regains the lead.

24:32.279 --> 24:34.201
- Go! Go! Go!
- Come on!

24:42.790 --> 24:45.042
Steve Prefontaine is the
three-mile champion...

24:45.125 --> 24:48.777
in one of the most electrifying
performances in a long time.

24:51.165 --> 24:53.178
One at a time!
One at a time!

24:53.267 --> 24:55.189
Pre, how'd you feel
about the race?

24:55.269 --> 24:58.351
If I'd gone out stronger, I could have
set an American record today.

24:58.438 --> 25:01.327
You're disappointed?
You set an N.C.A.A. record.

25:01.407 --> 25:03.489
I can run better, a lot better...

25:03.576 --> 25:05.498
but I need better
competition to do it.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.537
What about the end?
You must have had doubts...

25:09.615 --> 25:11.867
when Bjorkland and Berkeley
came at you like that.

25:11.951 --> 25:15.773
Never. What, I ran 2:00 flat
for the last two laps?

25:15.855 --> 25:20.838
Let me tell you something.
Nobody... nobody's gonna outkick me.

25:20.927 --> 25:24.818
I gotta go take care of my foot, guys.
Thanks a lot.

25:26.998 --> 25:29.956
That was a very impressive
performance, rube.

25:30.035 --> 25:31.957
I just ran my race.

25:32.037 --> 25:35.154
I'm talking about the way
you ran your mouth.

25:35.240 --> 25:39.597
Pre, you're gonna have every runner
in the country looking to gun you down.

25:39.678 --> 25:41.600
Bring 'em on.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.638
# I don't need to fight #

25:44.716 --> 25:49.267
# To prove I'm right #

25:49.354 --> 25:52.972
# I don't need to be forgiven #

25:53.058 --> 25:56.242
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

25:56.394 --> 25:57.873
I thought he was, basically...

25:57.962 --> 26:01.284
a talented little pissant
from the day I met him.

26:01.365 --> 26:05.290
As far as he was concerned, it was
like no one else on the team existed.

26:05.369 --> 26:10.056
In the discus circle,
Oregon sophomore Mac Wilkins.

26:10.141 --> 26:13.224
- Let's go!
- All right, Mac!

26:20.885 --> 26:23.967
That's easily the best throw
of Wilkins'career.

26:24.053 --> 26:28.342
It's beyond the 190-foot mark. Should
qualify him for the Olympic Trials.

26:31.294 --> 26:34.741
And guess who just
entered the field?

26:36.299 --> 26:41.384
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

26:41.471 --> 26:44.395
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

26:44.474 --> 26:48.763
I started calling him "World",
short for "World Famous".

26:48.845 --> 26:52.268
That meet, I also
won the shot put.

26:52.347 --> 26:54.907
I scored ten total
points for the team.

26:56.552 --> 26:59.271
I mean, Pre won his race.
It was no record time or nothing.

26:59.354 --> 27:02.039
He scored five points.

27:02.124 --> 27:05.412
But did it stop him from running
three victory laps?

27:05.494 --> 27:08.509
Or hogging the headlines
in the papers the next day?

27:10.432 --> 27:12.354
It didn't matter how
many events I won.

27:12.434 --> 27:14.686
He always had to be the man.

27:14.770 --> 27:17.557
- # If you get down #
- Big Mac!

27:17.639 --> 27:20.290
# And you get confused #

27:20.375 --> 27:23.628
# And you don't remember #

27:23.711 --> 27:25.463
# Who you been talkin' to #

27:25.546 --> 27:27.468
- Route change.
- Pre...

27:27.548 --> 27:29.470
# Concentration #

27:29.550 --> 27:32.599
A little privacy, please?

27:32.687 --> 27:35.542
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:35.623 --> 27:38.945
- I love your stride.
- Yours isn't too bad, either.

27:39.026 --> 27:42.177
- New on campus?
- I'm a freshman.

27:42.263 --> 27:44.242
- What's your name?
- Nancy Alleman.

27:44.332 --> 27:48.280
Steve was nothing like
I had expected him to be.

27:48.369 --> 27:50.347
He never even told me
who he was.

27:50.437 --> 27:53.224
I didn't tell you because...

27:53.306 --> 27:56.992
you know, I wanted you
to like me for me.

27:57.077 --> 27:58.556
I've heard things about you.

28:01.481 --> 28:05.668
Well, that's just with
guys I run against.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.708
I'm not that bad a guy.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.709
I'm sure.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.747
So, you race the 5,000
for the girls' team?

28:12.826 --> 28:14.942
And the two-mile relay.

28:18.565 --> 28:20.486
Ever since high school.

28:22.668 --> 28:25.148
I could really do something with you.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.660
What's that supposed to mean?

28:29.441 --> 28:31.363
I mean as a runner.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.926
Ellie. Ellie, no.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.940
The guy's car is...
It stalled.

28:40.019 --> 28:43.671
And double-parked.
I gotta tow him.

28:48.127 --> 28:52.449
Steve, he would lie because
he didn't want to hurt anyone.

28:54.866 --> 28:59.257
But what he didn't realize
was that... his lying...

28:59.337 --> 29:01.988
it hurt a hundred times worse.

29:02.073 --> 29:05.759
You don't have to sneak around
on me anymore, Mr. Big Shot.

29:05.843 --> 29:09.199
This is ridiculous.
I was at the library.

29:10.882 --> 29:14.067
Now go screw all the rich little
college girls your heart desires.

29:14.152 --> 29:16.074
Wait a second.
Where are you goin'?

29:16.154 --> 29:20.476
I came here for you.
Nothing else but you.

29:21.625 --> 29:25.072
Look...
But you can't do this, Ellie.

29:26.597 --> 29:28.519
I'm gonna marry you.

29:47.583 --> 29:51.872
Less than a year later,
when he found out that I was...

29:51.954 --> 29:54.240
I was gonna get married
in Portland...

29:54.323 --> 29:57.838
he called my mother and said
that I couldn't get married...

29:57.927 --> 30:01.283
because he was still planning
on marrying me someday.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.917
How many runners
we got here today?

30:12.008 --> 30:14.966
Hey, Pre, I'm on deadline.

30:15.044 --> 30:17.329
I said when I'm done.

30:17.412 --> 30:20.028
- What about baseball?
- Yeah.

30:20.115 --> 30:23.471
- See, baseball wouldn't be anything
without running, now would it? - No.

30:23.551 --> 30:28.067
- That's right. Anybody
like football? - Yeah.

30:28.156 --> 30:31.136
Football wouldn't be much
without running, now would it?

30:31.226 --> 30:34.616
- He always made time
for kids. - Sign mine!

30:34.696 --> 30:38.450
- One at a time. - He said he
saw himself in their little faces.

30:38.533 --> 30:41.354
- You got any fast
runners here? - Yeah!

30:41.436 --> 30:43.620
- You got any slowpokes?
- No!

30:43.705 --> 30:45.626
Ah, we'll see.

30:45.706 --> 30:48.527
Don't forget.
Use your upper body.

30:48.609 --> 30:52.193
You've gotta run with your arms,
too, not just with your legs.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.102
That's better, Ricky.

30:55.182 --> 30:56.900
Doin' a good job.

30:56.984 --> 31:00.636
Hey, Speed Racer.

31:00.721 --> 31:03.508
You're not ready
for me yet, kid.

31:08.162 --> 31:10.084
Steve, for the rest of his life...

31:10.164 --> 31:13.951
that little kid would have remembered
the day Steve Prefontaine let him win.

31:14.033 --> 31:18.549
Oh, you can't let a losing mentality
creep in here... ever.

31:18.638 --> 31:23.359
A losing mentality? Against a
nine-year-old? Are you serious?

31:25.378 --> 31:28.358
How do you think
I got this far, Nance?

31:28.448 --> 31:30.871
What do you mean?

31:33.586 --> 31:35.736
Well...

31:35.822 --> 31:37.870
do I look like a runner?

31:37.957 --> 31:40.812
No, you look like
a hammer thrower.

31:42.594 --> 31:45.245
Look at you.

31:45.330 --> 31:47.480
You've got long legs...

31:47.566 --> 31:51.991
a great stride,
you're tall, slender.

31:52.070 --> 31:54.550
You're built like a runner, not me.

31:54.639 --> 31:56.652
Steve.

31:57.776 --> 32:01.325
So, what have I got going for me?

32:04.116 --> 32:08.166
Why does some kid
from Coos Bay...

32:08.253 --> 32:12.302
with one leg shorter than
the other win races?

32:14.825 --> 32:17.714
Let me tell you somethin'.

32:17.795 --> 32:22.118
All of my life people
have said to me...

32:22.199 --> 32:24.713
"You're too small, Pre. "

32:24.802 --> 32:27.726
"You're not fast enough, Pre. "

32:28.806 --> 32:31.957
"Give up your foolish
dreams, Steve. "

32:34.044 --> 32:37.161
But you know what?
They forgot somethin'.

32:37.248 --> 32:39.671
I have to win.

32:39.750 --> 32:45.039
There's no fallback here. No
great stride, no long legs! Nothing!

32:53.463 --> 32:55.419
I'm sorry.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.517
Steve, from the moment I saw you...

33:00.603 --> 33:02.992
you looked like the
best runner ever.

33:07.844 --> 33:12.359
He always had a great need,
ya know.

33:12.447 --> 33:15.268
I mean, just...
just an endless need...

33:15.350 --> 33:17.773
that came from somewhere.

33:52.220 --> 33:55.178
I'm not thinkin' about
makin' the team.

33:55.256 --> 33:57.304
I'm thinkin' about gold in Munich.

34:07.235 --> 34:10.214
What's on the training table
this morning, Galloway?

34:10.303 --> 34:12.658
Hot dogs again.

34:12.739 --> 34:15.321
Breakfast of champions.

34:18.178 --> 34:20.429
Oh, man.

34:31.157 --> 34:33.306
This is bullshit, Frank.

34:33.393 --> 34:36.179
And we're paying for these
wonderful accommodations too.

34:36.263 --> 34:39.880
I met a runner who had to hock his
trophies to pay for his plane ticket.

34:39.965 --> 34:43.116
You'd think they'd at least put
guys up once they got here.

34:43.202 --> 34:45.123
Au contraire, the A.T.U.
and the Olympic committee...

34:45.204 --> 34:47.456
are dedicated to preserving
our amateur virginity.

34:47.539 --> 34:49.587
That's so screwed up.

34:49.675 --> 34:51.893
Somebody ought
to do something.

34:59.885 --> 35:02.001
Frank Shorter is going to Munich!

35:02.087 --> 35:05.011
He'll be our top qualifier
in the 10,000 meters.

35:08.293 --> 35:12.184
Are you paying for your suite
at the Hyatt, Curtis?

35:12.263 --> 35:14.515
Is Dick here sleeping
on your floor?

35:14.599 --> 35:16.521
You're mixing apples
and oranges, Bill.

35:16.601 --> 35:19.286
We couldn't afford to put the
athletes up even if we wanted to.

35:19.370 --> 35:22.794
That's right. Gotta save back some of
those millions you got in the treasury...

35:22.874 --> 35:26.696
so you can send over 100 officials
to Munich in style.

35:26.778 --> 35:28.325
Luckily for you,
your opinions on that...

35:28.413 --> 35:31.496
were overlooked by the selection
committee this year.

35:31.582 --> 35:36.666
Your job is to coach the
team on the track. Period.

35:36.753 --> 35:38.937
Understand?

35:39.022 --> 35:42.640
Maybe I'll have the university
hold back the gate receipts.

35:42.726 --> 35:45.012
Let a court decide
this situation.

35:45.095 --> 35:48.610
No, no.

35:48.699 --> 35:51.315
No, you've got a choice.

35:51.401 --> 35:53.790
You can take us to court...

35:53.870 --> 35:56.725
or you can take the
team to Munich.

35:56.807 --> 35:58.923
What's it gonna be, Bill?

36:05.614 --> 36:08.970
Wilkins up. James on deck.
Gilbert in the hole.

36:20.429 --> 36:24.217
Wilkins' final throw,
175 feet, four inches.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.222
He remains in 12th place.

36:30.139 --> 36:33.528
First call for the 5,000 meter final.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.656
All competitors,
please report to the clerk.

36:35.744 --> 36:39.566
- New and improved.
- Still no one-piece toe?

36:39.647 --> 36:42.468
That's harder than you think.
Nobody makes them one-piece.

36:42.550 --> 36:45.007
These homemade seams are
gonna give me big-time blisters.

36:45.086 --> 36:47.668
Give me the damn shoes back.

36:47.756 --> 36:52.341
Give 'em back! Last damn thing I need
is you out there thinking about shoes.

36:52.427 --> 36:55.078
One-piece toe! When's
the last time you ate?

36:55.163 --> 36:58.314
It doesn't matter. It's all
over there in that trash can.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.221
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

37:01.302 --> 37:04.418
It's weird.

37:04.505 --> 37:08.487
Here I am,just a race away
from making it to Munich...

37:08.575 --> 37:11.692
and suddenly my legs
feel like logs.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.996
That's just nerves.

37:15.082 --> 37:18.597
Think of how nervous Young
is trying to slay you...

37:18.685 --> 37:21.836
a fire-breathing dragon
in your own backyard.

37:21.922 --> 37:27.212
You are going to burn his ass up.

37:27.361 --> 37:32.514
In lane one, bronze medalist
in the '68 Olympics...

37:32.598 --> 37:35.681
the legend, the veteran,
George Young.

37:42.175 --> 37:46.862
In lane two, Washington State's great
four-time N.C.A.A. champion...

37:46.946 --> 37:49.699
Jerry Lindgren.

37:57.356 --> 37:59.335
Boo!

38:02.527 --> 38:06.384
And in lane three, a junior
from the University of Oregon...

38:06.465 --> 38:09.480
three-time N.C.A.A. champion...

38:09.568 --> 38:13.584
American record holder
in the 5,000 meters...

38:13.672 --> 38:17.893
never defeated at Hayward Field,
Steve Prefontaine!

38:30.754 --> 38:33.177
Lap ten of a very fast 5,000.

38:34.558 --> 38:37.072
The race now is between
Pre and Young.

38:46.904 --> 38:48.952
Pre takes the lead!

38:49.039 --> 38:51.462
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

38:51.542 --> 38:55.694
Can the kid break the veteran? One of
the guttiest runners in track history.

39:03.386 --> 39:07.072
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

39:08.258 --> 39:10.818
Little son of a gun's
goin' for the record.

39:12.362 --> 39:14.375
- Kick! Kick! Kick! Kick! Kick!
- Go for it! Go for it!

39:35.984 --> 39:38.839
Prefontaine misses
the world record...

39:38.921 --> 39:42.140
but shatters his own American
record by seven seconds.

39:50.032 --> 39:52.683
Congratulations.
You did it.

39:52.768 --> 39:54.690
We did it.

39:56.037 --> 39:58.892
You still think nobody cares
about the three-mile?

40:04.579 --> 40:07.503
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

40:10.451 --> 40:13.340
I never understood,
son, why you ran.

40:13.421 --> 40:16.743
Now she's a nervous wreck as
soon as you come on to the field.

40:16.824 --> 40:20.578
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

40:48.688 --> 40:53.580
Steve Prefontaine has capped an impressive
week for American track and field.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.480
Prefontaine celebrates
his 21 st victory today.

40:56.562 --> 41:00.350
Pre has won the 5,000, the glamour
event of these Olympic Trials.

41:00.432 --> 41:04.528
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

41:13.912 --> 41:16.494
It was like long ago
Steve had begun...

41:16.582 --> 41:20.632
this incredible dance with
the press and his fans.

41:20.719 --> 41:24.575
Now the music was playing
faster and faster.

41:24.656 --> 41:26.578
How you feelin', Pre?

41:26.658 --> 41:28.637
- I'm feelin' very late.
- Are you ready?

41:28.726 --> 41:32.913
- Ready for what? - Come on, Pre.
You're always good for a quote.

41:32.997 --> 41:36.216
Pre, the experts say you're just a
21-year-old, inexperienced kid...

41:36.301 --> 41:38.587
who's never faced the
top European runners.

41:38.670 --> 41:42.527
Hey, Pre, how do you expect to beat
the best in the world on their turf?

41:42.607 --> 41:45.861
I'm going to run the last mile
under four minutes...

41:45.943 --> 41:47.956
and I dare anybody
to stay with me.

41:48.046 --> 41:51.902
That's crazy!

41:51.982 --> 41:55.065
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

41:59.256 --> 42:02.111
I guess this is good-bye.

42:07.798 --> 42:12.223
I've been dreamin' about this for
so long. Tell me it's really happening.

42:12.302 --> 42:15.123
Look, Steve,
I want you to know...

42:15.205 --> 42:17.457
you're more than
just my boyfriend.

42:17.541 --> 42:20.362
You're my hero too.

42:20.444 --> 42:22.866
I know you're gonna kick ass.

42:22.945 --> 42:26.130
What if I don't?

42:34.223 --> 42:36.145
I don't want to go.

42:38.394 --> 42:40.646
I'm scared.

43:00.682 --> 43:04.869
Only these people will
ever see this live...

43:04.953 --> 43:10.175
but you, along with almost
a billion other people...

43:10.258 --> 43:13.147
are seeing it on television.

43:13.228 --> 43:15.913
Okay, they just cued the doves.
Here they come.

43:15.997 --> 43:18.648
There go the Bavarian doves,
5,000 of them.

43:18.733 --> 43:21.121
They've dubbed this Olympiad...

43:21.201 --> 43:23.658
the "Serene Olympics".

43:23.737 --> 43:26.558
Those are the symbolic colors
of these Olympics...

43:26.640 --> 43:29.655
instead of the Nazi banners
that flew here the last time.

43:29.743 --> 43:34.362
And here they come,
the United States of America.

43:34.448 --> 43:36.370
Great uniforms this year,
aren't they?

43:36.450 --> 43:38.372
Look.

43:38.452 --> 43:42.434
There's Steve Prefontaine, one of
America's best hopes for a gold medal.

43:44.291 --> 43:46.213
And there's Art Walker,
the triple jumper.

43:46.293 --> 43:49.807
- You guys see that Swedish long jumper?
- What do you think, I'm blind?

43:49.896 --> 43:54.151
She sure wasn't. The way she was checking
out every guy in the U.S. delegation.

43:54.233 --> 43:57.248
- For real? God bless America.
- That's right.

43:57.336 --> 44:01.432
- Goodbye.
- # Oh, say can you see #

44:01.507 --> 44:04.158
- Identification. Identification.
- # By the dawn's early light #

44:04.243 --> 44:08.464
- # By the twilight's last gleam... #
- Give it up, Galloway.

44:08.548 --> 44:11.108
If you get on the medal stand,
just move your lips.

44:13.820 --> 44:16.505
Home sweet home.

44:17.956 --> 44:20.811
What did they have, 5,000 doves?

44:20.892 --> 44:24.214
800 dancing girls?

44:24.296 --> 44:27.015
At least we know what they
spent their money on.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.422
Look on the bright side, guys.

44:30.502 --> 44:33.153
To clean it, all we
need is a fire hose.

44:33.238 --> 44:35.160
Jesus.

45:27.991 --> 45:30.505
Mark Spitz has the lead. Here
comes Hayden Locke in the middle.

45:30.593 --> 45:33.517
Over here in lane eight,
it's John Murphy, putting on a sprint.

45:33.596 --> 45:36.053
John Murphy coming hard
in lane eight.

45:36.132 --> 45:41.650
Murphy's after Spitz! It's too late.
The winner is Mark Spitz! He's got six!

45:41.738 --> 45:45.025
And he's got a new world
and Olympic record.

45:45.107 --> 45:49.123
There is time for the Russians to go
to their big man, Alexander Belov.

45:49.211 --> 45:51.133
They're going to try.

45:53.615 --> 45:56.539
Alexander Belov!
And this time it is over.

45:58.487 --> 46:02.071
First it was indicated
the U.S. had won 49-48.

46:02.157 --> 46:04.079
That looks like the final score...

46:04.159 --> 46:06.810
although there is a big rhubarb
going on in front of the bench.

46:09.631 --> 46:12.953
No, no, no.
I'm serious. Come on.

46:13.034 --> 46:16.959
Guys who are trying to double up
on the 5,000 and 10,000?

46:17.038 --> 46:19.518
Bedford? Yifter? Lasse Viren?

46:19.607 --> 46:21.529
I'm not worried about them.

46:23.210 --> 46:26.225
- The race is in the bag.
- Shh.

46:26.314 --> 46:29.738
What the hell are
you drinkin', Pre?

46:29.817 --> 46:33.366
Last I looked, Bedford was
the world record holder.

46:33.454 --> 46:36.742
Viren just set a world record in
the two-mile last month.

46:36.824 --> 46:41.750
Viren's been running
good races, true. True.

46:41.829 --> 46:45.184
But when I make my move
with a mile to go...

46:45.265 --> 46:47.415
it's gonna be "whoosh"!

46:47.500 --> 46:51.015
And those guy's will feel
like they hit a stone wall.

46:51.104 --> 46:53.186
"Whoosh"?

46:54.441 --> 46:57.262
"Whoosh".

46:57.344 --> 47:00.302
Frank Shorter of the United
States is still hanging back.

47:00.380 --> 47:05.135
You're watching the 10,000 meter final
live on a beautiful sunny day in Munich.

47:06.252 --> 47:08.174
There goes Viren, down.

47:08.254 --> 47:11.734
- Gammoudi trips over him and falls
off the track. - Man. Tough break.

47:11.824 --> 47:14.907
Not for Shorter!

47:14.994 --> 47:17.383
Come on, Frank.
Time to make your move.

47:17.463 --> 47:20.443
Don't count Viren out yet.

47:20.532 --> 47:22.454
...less than three laps to go.

47:22.534 --> 47:23.392
Amazing!

47:23.695 --> 47:27.607
After falling, Viren has quickly rejoined
the pack and is now moving into fifth.

47:27.642 --> 47:32.695
- Jesus, what a talent. - Yeah,
it's the best that money can buy.

47:32.778 --> 47:34.928
What's that supposed to mean?

47:35.014 --> 47:37.869
He's like a lot of
the top Europeans.

47:37.950 --> 47:41.806
He's got a fake government job that
doesn't cut into his training regime.

47:41.886 --> 47:45.538
Got an entourage of doctors
and trainers wherever he goes.

47:47.558 --> 47:52.643
But they're not athletes over here, man.
It's like they're national treasures.

47:52.730 --> 47:56.848
I don't know. Looks like
a goddamn stallion to me.

47:56.934 --> 47:59.823
And now, after six miles,
here they go.

47:59.904 --> 48:02.919
Passing slower runners.
The three of them going for the gold.

48:03.007 --> 48:06.955
This is unbelievable.

48:07.045 --> 48:09.365
- He's going after the record.
- The Finnish flag's still flying.

48:09.446 --> 48:13.633
Here comes Puttemans after Viren.

48:13.717 --> 48:15.969
Look at Viren accelerate.

48:16.053 --> 48:19.011
And Viren's going to hold it!

48:23.160 --> 48:25.720
Lasse Viren the winner, 27:38.

48:25.796 --> 48:30.221
That breaks the world record
of 27:39.4...

48:30.300 --> 48:32.985
By about half a second.

48:33.070 --> 48:35.686
I'll tell you, Jim, there's
one man in these stands...

48:35.772 --> 48:39.628
that had better be worried having watched
this race, and that's Steve Prefontaine.

48:39.709 --> 48:44.032
The world record of Ron Clarke had stood
since 1965. There was Frank Shannon.

48:44.113 --> 48:48.436
Look at this. Here's
a bit of real Olympia.

48:48.517 --> 48:52.271
A kid, a blond-haired boy with the
Finnish flag leaping over the barrier...

48:54.156 --> 48:56.078
Viren!

49:01.731 --> 49:03.653
Look.

49:04.800 --> 49:07.222
Hey, Pre, come here,
quick. I need you.

49:15.376 --> 49:18.197
God, he makes other guys look like
they're standin' still.

49:18.279 --> 49:22.101
Exactly. Stand still.
Don't move.

49:22.183 --> 49:26.233
To folks up there watchin', it's just
America's greatest distance runner...

49:26.321 --> 49:28.937
conferring with his two coaches.

49:29.023 --> 49:32.777
Down here, it's you two guys
covering me while I take a leak.

49:32.861 --> 49:36.546
- This isn't Eugene, Bill.
- I need a new race plan.

49:36.630 --> 49:40.111
- Relax, rube.
- Goddamn it, Bill. I'm serious.

49:40.200 --> 49:43.852
Look, if you were running
the 400 against Viren...

49:43.937 --> 49:46.417
we could all join hands about
now and have a good cry.

49:46.507 --> 49:49.522
You're runnin'the 5,000.

49:51.345 --> 49:55.668
Listen to me, rube. On Saturday,
his posse won't mean squat.

49:55.749 --> 49:59.503
Bedford'll go out fast,
and you'll stay right on his butt.

49:59.586 --> 50:03.682
By the time you get ready to take over,
Viren's legs will be crap.

50:03.757 --> 50:08.546
The only kick he'll have left is the one
you give him in the ass on your way by.

50:23.784 --> 50:26.207
Look at Viren accelerate!

50:26.286 --> 50:28.436
And Viren's going to hold it!

50:28.522 --> 50:31.673
That breaks the world
record of 27:39...

51:25.443 --> 51:27.365
Hello?

51:27.445 --> 51:30.027
Hello. Is this the U.S. complex?
Please, is this...

51:30.114 --> 51:33.867
- Who the hell is this? - Shaoul Adami.
Something horrible is happening.

51:33.951 --> 51:36.533
I know it. Please.
I need your help.

51:39.256 --> 51:42.737
- What's going on? Where are you?
- I need you. Run! No!

51:42.826 --> 51:45.750
Run! No! No!

51:45.829 --> 51:48.514
- No!
- Hello? Hello?

51:54.972 --> 51:59.454
I've got an extreme emergency. Get me a
number inside of the American Embassy.

51:59.543 --> 52:01.794
Right away, damn it!
Do it now!

52:09.485 --> 52:12.136
This is an I.T.N. news flash...

52:12.221 --> 52:15.372
from the Olympic Village in Munich,
where Arab gunmen...

52:15.458 --> 52:18.018
The peace of what have been
called the "Serene Olympics"...

52:18.094 --> 52:20.574
was shattered just before
dawn this morning...

52:26.736 --> 52:30.024
Arriving passengers,
do not be alarmed.

52:30.106 --> 52:34.030
- American killed him?
- No, Israeli.

52:34.109 --> 52:37.966
Arab terrorists went to the
headquarters of the Israeli team...

52:38.046 --> 52:41.493
and immediately killed one man,
Moshe Weinberg, a coach.

52:41.583 --> 52:44.234
Two shots in the head,
one in the stomach.

52:44.319 --> 52:47.038
The guerillas are demanding
the release...

52:47.122 --> 52:50.569
of 250 Arabs held
prisoner in Israel...

52:50.659 --> 52:53.583
and have set noon as the
deadline for their release.

52:53.662 --> 52:56.142
They had set a deadline of noon...

52:56.231 --> 52:59.052
saying that they were going to kill
all of their hostages at that time.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.249
That deadline, obviously, has passed.

53:01.335 --> 53:04.816
There are men with guns
beginning to train those guns...

53:04.905 --> 53:07.825
on the rooms where the two heads
were sticking out a moment ago

53:08.082 --> 53:09.943
of the Arab guerilla lookouts.

53:09.978 --> 53:13.334
- One man with binoculars...
- Has anybody here seen Mark Spitz?

53:13.414 --> 53:16.099
- No. - Where in
the hell is Spitz?

53:16.183 --> 53:19.163
How many Jewish athletes
do we have on the team?

53:19.253 --> 53:22.609
This is happening now,
if you can possibly believe that.

53:22.690 --> 53:26.205
A crowd estimated
at 75,000 to 80,000 people...

53:26.293 --> 53:29.216
has gathered, awaiting
the outcome of this.

53:29.295 --> 53:33.686
Here are the men with what appear to be,
I suppose, submachine guns.

53:33.766 --> 53:38.055
These are the Germans. They are
the men trying to free the Israelis.

54:02.628 --> 54:05.552
They suspended the Games.

54:05.631 --> 54:08.555
Burke just told us.

54:08.634 --> 54:13.492
I guess murdered athletes
don't make for good sport.

54:13.572 --> 54:18.498
It's the right thing to do.
We should all go home now.

54:18.577 --> 54:20.761
Oh, I don't know.

54:20.846 --> 54:25.829
I know this is awful to say, 'cause
I feel terribly for those guys over there...

54:25.917 --> 54:30.671
but right now all I can think about
is how hard I've worked to get here.

54:30.755 --> 54:33.337
I feel ripped off, man.

54:33.424 --> 54:35.745
Is that where you're at, Pre?

54:51.375 --> 54:54.128
It's dark. It's 23 minutes
past 7:00 in the evening...

54:54.211 --> 54:57.691
and inside that little block
are ten Israelis,

54:57.781 --> 54:59.703
one of them believed dead...

54:59.783 --> 55:02.536
the other nine said to
be standing in a circle...

55:02.619 --> 55:05.179
hands tied behind their back
and lashed to each other...

55:11.294 --> 55:13.216
Come on, Pre.

55:17.233 --> 55:20.316
Grab your stuff. You're
staying with me tonight.

55:28.844 --> 55:30.994
Steve! Steve!

55:31.080 --> 55:33.002
Steve!

55:33.082 --> 55:35.334
- I'm okay.
- I was so worried.

55:35.417 --> 55:37.874
On the plane it was
so awful, so awful.

55:37.953 --> 55:40.433
The guards won't let us in.
Oh, Steve!

55:43.592 --> 55:46.914
It's all right.
I'm okay.

55:46.995 --> 55:49.919
Pre, can you give us a sense
of the mood inside...

55:49.998 --> 55:53.252
Goddamn it!
Leave me alone!

55:53.335 --> 55:55.723
PeterJennings here in
the Olympic Village.

55:55.803 --> 55:59.159
One of the helicopters now proceeds
out over the Olympic site.

56:02.310 --> 56:05.632
You cannot exit this gate.
You must leave the area immediately.

56:05.713 --> 56:08.864
I'm sorry. I gotta get him out of here.
He'll be staying with me.

56:08.950 --> 56:11.839
I'll call you at the hotel, Mom.

56:11.919 --> 56:14.843
The Israeli hostages and
the Arab commandos...

56:14.922 --> 56:17.971
who have held them hostage
for this entire day...

56:18.415 --> 56:19.967
have now left,

56:20.314 --> 56:23.379
gone to a makeshift helicopter pad
at the back of the Olympic Village.

56:43.283 --> 56:46.036
I've just been told that
the German police...

56:46.119 --> 56:49.008
thought they had
the Arabs isolated...

56:49.089 --> 56:52.012
opened fire on them,
whereupon, reportedly...

56:52.091 --> 56:55.049
the Arabs threw a hand
grenade into the helicopter...

56:55.127 --> 56:58.415
- Ohhh. - blowing up the helicopter
and killing all the hostages.

56:58.497 --> 57:02.046
All of the hostages are dead.

57:02.134 --> 57:06.082
- Most of the Arabs are dead, three of
them are in hospitals, - What happened?

57:06.172 --> 57:08.857
and one of them may
still be on the loose.

57:08.941 --> 57:12.661
It's over.
Everybody's dead.

57:12.745 --> 57:15.100
They're all gone.

57:15.181 --> 57:18.105
The Israeli Olympic team
is destroyed...

57:18.184 --> 57:21.107
much of it, some of their officials.

57:21.186 --> 57:24.633
But what will happen to the
Games of the 20th Olympiad?

57:24.722 --> 57:29.477
None of us know what will happen
to the course of world history.

57:57.754 --> 58:00.769
I know this is hard, but you
gotta put this behind you.

58:00.858 --> 58:04.680
Behind me?
The Games are over.

58:04.761 --> 58:07.480
- The Games will resume.
- Yeah, right.

58:09.099 --> 58:11.750
They'll resume, and they'll
run the 5,000 meters.

58:11.835 --> 58:14.486
So what?
I'm not running.

58:14.571 --> 58:16.493
Calm down.

58:16.573 --> 58:18.620
Calm down?

58:18.708 --> 58:21.962
Come on.
Can't you see?

58:22.044 --> 58:24.968
It's all ruined now.

58:25.047 --> 58:28.198
With the "Happy Games. "
What a joke!

58:28.284 --> 58:31.435
I've been dreaming about
this since I was 16.

58:31.520 --> 58:34.444
This is not how it's
supposed to be!

58:34.523 --> 58:37.242
They'll start back up
tomorrow or the day after.

58:37.326 --> 58:40.511
That's great. Great.

58:40.596 --> 58:43.485
That's just great.

58:45.401 --> 58:47.686
Over the dead bodies
of those athletes...

58:47.769 --> 58:49.987
we're gonna go on like
nothing happened.

58:50.071 --> 58:52.687
Run races and salute the flag!

58:52.774 --> 58:54.696
Pre, look at me.

58:54.776 --> 58:58.223
You think that Viren and Yifter
and Bedford are talking like this?

58:58.313 --> 59:01.828
You think they're wringing their hands
and packing their bags over this thing?

59:01.917 --> 59:04.431
They came here to win
a goddamn race!

59:04.519 --> 59:07.943
Now, maybe Viren's a sensitive
humanitarian back in Finland...

59:08.023 --> 59:11.447
but right now I'll bet there's a
little voice in his head, saying...

59:11.526 --> 59:15.451
"Hey, I just got an extra day's rest
for the 5,000. "

59:15.530 --> 59:18.953
An extra day's rest?

59:19.033 --> 59:21.547
That's not fair.

59:21.635 --> 59:23.557
- Pre, listen...
- Wait a second!

59:23.637 --> 59:27.152
- They can't let any of the 10,000 guys
off the hook... - Pre, listen to me!

59:27.241 --> 59:29.892
Now, you've got to
keep your focus!

59:29.977 --> 59:32.229
You're running phenomenal
intervals right now...

59:32.313 --> 59:35.396
and believe me,
those guys know it too.

59:35.482 --> 59:39.373
They're afraid of you.
Don't be afraid of them.

59:40.888 --> 59:43.903
I'm not afraid of them.

59:43.991 --> 59:46.470
I'm not afraid of anybody.

59:49.662 --> 59:52.313
One day away from the biggest
race in your life...

59:52.398 --> 59:54.650
what's going through your mind?

59:54.734 --> 59:57.521
I just want to run my race
and get it over with.

59:57.603 --> 59:59.787
Still predicting victory?

59:59.872 --> 01:00:01.988
Pre?

01:00:02.075 --> 01:00:04.691
I'm just doing the best I can.

01:00:06.145 --> 01:00:08.898
The basketball federation
has upheld...

01:00:08.982 --> 01:00:12.167
Russia's controversial
victory in basketball.

01:00:12.251 --> 01:00:15.208
Things continue to go downhill
for the United States in Munich.

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:38.526
All competitors for the 5,000 meter
race,your event is next.

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:43.536
Make sure your numbers are visible on
the front of jersey and right hip of shorts.

01:00:43.615 --> 01:00:48.233
Make sure your numbers are clearly visible
on front of jersey and right hip of shorts.

01:00:48.319 --> 01:00:52.369
Officials will check your number
at the entrance to the stadium.

01:01:01.966 --> 01:01:05.720
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:01:05.803 --> 01:01:09.091
This unquestionably,
I would say, Erich...

01:01:09.173 --> 01:01:11.391
is the quality field
of the Olympics.

01:01:11.475 --> 01:01:14.921
There are, perhaps, seven,
eight, nine or ten men in this field...

01:01:15.011 --> 01:01:17.935
that could easily take
the gold medal.

01:01:18.014 --> 01:01:21.836
Prefontaine told me the other night,
or about a week ago...

01:01:21.918 --> 01:01:25.843
"What I'm gonna try to do is work it out
so it'll be a pure guts race at the end...

01:01:25.922 --> 01:01:28.846
and if it is, I'm the only
one who can win. "

01:01:35.765 --> 01:01:38.814
I'd like to make this statement;
I think Steve Prefontaine...

01:01:38.902 --> 01:01:41.257
will be the Olympic
5,000 meter champion.

01:01:42.671 --> 01:01:45.458
I think he will break the world's
record at 5,000 meters...

01:01:45.541 --> 01:01:48.465
but I think he will have
to do it in Montreal.

01:01:48.544 --> 01:01:51.433
Because today,
Steve Prefontaine, 21 years old...

01:01:51.513 --> 01:01:53.697
is running up against
the very big boys.

01:01:53.782 --> 01:01:55.704
All right, you know the plan:

01:01:55.784 --> 01:01:58.207
You're gonna draft behind Bedford
until the last three laps...

01:01:58.287 --> 01:02:01.211
then you're gonna go out
and take over the race.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.680
Put the crap in all those
damn kickers' legs, Pre.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.843
Feel like someone threw a
shot put down your throat?

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:11.513
It'll all go away when
the gun sounds.

01:02:11.599 --> 01:02:14.523
I can't look.

01:02:14.602 --> 01:02:17.685
He'll do fine, Elfriede.
He'll do just fine.

01:02:17.772 --> 01:02:19.956
Here they are at the line.

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:24.865
There's no field more talented than the
field that is running in the 5,000 meters.

01:02:27.381 --> 01:02:30.566
Auf die Platzen.

01:02:44.664 --> 01:02:46.848
A very slow pace, Jim.

01:02:46.933 --> 01:02:49.515
Sixty-nine-second quarters.
A very slow pace.

01:02:49.603 --> 01:02:53.289
This kind of slow pace
favors the finishers...

01:02:53.373 --> 01:02:56.092
like Ian Stewart, Lasse Viren...

01:02:58.345 --> 01:03:02.463
- Where is Bedford? David
Bedford of Britain. - Who?

01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:05.871
Bedford's always been a front-runner,
but he's way back.

01:03:05.952 --> 01:03:09.034
Only six laps to go, Erich.

01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:11.305
This is a little dangerous...

01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:13.847
even for Steve Prefontaine,
to let it go this slowly.

01:03:13.926 --> 01:03:15.746
This is not good.

01:03:15.828 --> 01:03:18.581
If it's so slow, why doesn't Pre
just take over?

01:03:18.664 --> 01:03:21.087
'Cause then everyone will
just draft right behind him.

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:23.647
Leading drains you
more than following.

01:03:23.736 --> 01:03:26.296
I've never seen Pre
do anything but lead.

01:03:36.148 --> 01:03:38.160
Go, Steve!

01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:40.433
Sixty-seven on that last quarter.

01:03:40.518 --> 01:03:42.907
The kickers are licking their chops.

01:03:53.798 --> 01:03:55.880
Now Prefontaine moving up.

01:03:55.967 --> 01:03:58.049
And Steve Prefontaine
is going to take the lead.

01:03:58.136 --> 01:04:01.060
- One mile to go.
- Four laps to go.

01:04:05.243 --> 01:04:07.563
Steve! Steve! Steve!

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:20.578
Viren is moving up on the outside.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.440
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:50.667
Here's Viren going for the lead.

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:54.803
This is when Viren
makes his long drive.

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:57.609
This could be the break
from the other group.

01:04:57.693 --> 01:05:02.642
You have Viren, Puttemans, Stewart,
Gammoudi and Prefontaine.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:05.188
No man at the age of
21 has ever won...

01:05:05.267 --> 01:05:08.020
this long, tough and
thinking man's race...

01:05:08.103 --> 01:05:10.287
the 5,000 meters.

01:05:20.048 --> 01:05:22.369
Prefontaine going
for the lead again.

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:25.237
Just 600 yards to go, and he's
trying an all-out kick.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.902
Come on, Pre!

01:05:27.989 --> 01:05:30.571
Look at that magnificent
little son of a bitch.

01:05:30.659 --> 01:05:33.583
He knows he can't out-kick Viren,
so he's going to sprint 600 yards.

01:05:33.662 --> 01:05:38.382
Pre is running a gutsy race.
What a kick he's putting on.

01:05:51.578 --> 01:05:53.660
It's gonna be a last lap fight.

01:05:53.747 --> 01:05:56.830
It seems impossible that Prefontaine
can out-kick Viren or Gammoudi.

01:05:56.917 --> 01:05:59.067
Viren!
Viren!

01:06:01.021 --> 01:06:03.500
Viren is going for his second
gold medal of the Games.

01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:05.511
Mohammed Gammoudi
is right with him.

01:06:05.591 --> 01:06:07.980
And so is Steve Prefontaine!

01:06:08.061 --> 01:06:10.211
The kid is showing all
the guts in the world.

01:06:10.296 --> 01:06:13.254
Go, World!
Kick their asses!

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:17.019
He's hanging in there
with the kickers.

01:06:17.103 --> 01:06:19.458
Prefontaine going for the
lead with Gammoudi.

01:06:19.539 --> 01:06:21.359
You can do it!
Come on!

01:06:21.441 --> 01:06:24.092
Viren is still there.

01:06:24.177 --> 01:06:26.793
We're coming to you live
from the Munich Stadium.

01:06:26.879 --> 01:06:30.770
Nobody in the world knows how it's going to
turn out until they head down the stretch.

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:34.945
Coming to the last turn!
Here comes Prefontaine!

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.807
Let's go!
Come on, baby!

01:06:56.174 --> 01:06:58.153
And here it comes.

01:06:58.243 --> 01:07:02.292
The Brit's try to pass Prefontaine
for the bronze. It's going to be close.

01:07:28.739 --> 01:07:33.596
That man is one of the world's
greatest runners in a long time.

01:07:33.676 --> 01:07:38.602
At the age of 23, Lasse Viren,
the policeman from Finland, has won it.

01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:42.128
How do you feel about
winning two gold medals?

01:07:51.728 --> 01:07:53.980
He ran his heart out.

01:07:55.732 --> 01:07:57.711
He ran his heart out.

01:08:07.276 --> 01:08:09.232
Let him go.

01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:13.998
Viren! Viren! Viren!

01:08:14.082 --> 01:08:17.734
Viren! Viren!
Viren!

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:22.188
Viren! Viren!
Viren! Viren!

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:27.174
Viren! Viren!
Viren! Viren!

01:08:27.296 --> 01:08:30.048
This is the way it ended...

01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:33.316
almost four years ago on
that night in Mexico City.

01:08:40.374 --> 01:08:42.421
Pre?

01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:47.600
Oh, no!

01:08:55.055 --> 01:08:57.511
- Come on. Let's get you to bed.
- I lost it.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:01.072
- Come on. You need sleep.
- No. It's my fault.

01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:04.140
- Kid, stand up. Help me...
- It's my fault!

01:09:04.231 --> 01:09:06.688
- I fucked up!
- It's not your fault.

01:09:06.765 --> 01:09:09.984
It was in '66-'67...

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:13.085
'67-'68.

01:09:13.173 --> 01:09:15.528
I'm sorry.

01:09:18.511 --> 01:09:21.197
Bedford never went out.

01:09:21.281 --> 01:09:24.261
Son of a bitch has been a
front-runner his whole life.

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:26.671
He wimps out now.

01:09:26.752 --> 01:09:31.439
I'm such a fuckin' loser.
I fucked up!

01:09:31.524 --> 01:09:36.211
You're not a loser.
You ran your heart out.

01:09:38.363 --> 01:09:40.752
You got to try and let it go, Pre.

01:09:45.604 --> 01:09:46.792
Go, Pre.

01:09:48.876 --> 01:09:50.429
Go, Pre.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:54.914
Go, Pre.

01:10:41.058 --> 01:10:43.515
Welcome home.

01:10:43.594 --> 01:10:45.550
Hi, baby.

01:10:45.629 --> 01:10:48.951
There's no fans out there,
are there?

01:10:49.032 --> 01:10:50.954
No.

01:10:51.034 --> 01:10:52.956
Any reporters?

01:10:53.036 --> 01:10:56.357
No one knows you're back.
You okay?

01:10:56.439 --> 01:10:58.452
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:11:00.943 --> 01:11:02.865
Really, I am.

01:11:02.945 --> 01:11:06.369
I'm very proud of you, Steve.
The whole town is.

01:11:06.449 --> 01:11:09.873
Yeah, I'm sure. They'll probably
name a street after me.

01:11:09.952 --> 01:11:12.204
Call it "Fourth Street. "

01:11:24.065 --> 01:11:26.852
Hey!
Pre!

01:11:26.935 --> 01:11:29.517
Hey, Mac.

01:11:31.072 --> 01:11:33.529
I saw your race.

01:11:46.421 --> 01:11:49.845
Somebody forget to tell you
guys the season's over?

01:11:49.924 --> 01:11:53.040
Something's happened to Mac.
Must've bumped his head or something.

01:11:53.127 --> 01:11:55.277
He's lookin' awfully good.

01:11:55.362 --> 01:11:58.809
You, on the other hand,
look like shit.

01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:01.015
When'd you get back?

01:12:01.101 --> 01:12:03.183
Tell me the rumors
aren't true, Bill.

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:05.352
Which rumors?

01:12:05.439 --> 01:12:07.760
This is no time to retire.

01:12:07.841 --> 01:12:11.060
You know, someone once said,
"He who runs against time...

01:12:11.145 --> 01:12:14.501
has an adversary not
subject to casualties. "

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:18.802
I'm 62. I'm gettin'
too old for all this.

01:12:18.886 --> 01:12:21.809
That's bullshit.

01:12:21.888 --> 01:12:24.903
You're the best damn
coach in the world.

01:12:24.991 --> 01:12:30.440
Who presided over the worst performance
of a U.S. team in Olympic history?

01:12:33.066 --> 01:12:35.318
That wasn't your fault.

01:12:35.401 --> 01:12:39.497
After all that happened,
you couldn't run those races for us.

01:12:39.572 --> 01:12:41.995
We're the ones that blew it.

01:12:42.075 --> 01:12:43.997
I blew it.

01:12:44.077 --> 01:12:46.295
You could've run for the bronze.

01:12:46.379 --> 01:12:49.336
You could've run for the silver.

01:12:49.414 --> 01:12:52.338
You ran to win.

01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:55.102
I couldn't ask more than
that from an athlete.

01:12:57.255 --> 01:12:59.576
It's funny.
These days...

01:12:59.658 --> 01:13:03.583
I don't know if I want to train like
hell and kick Lasse Viren's ass...

01:13:03.662 --> 01:13:06.222
or stay in bed.

01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:10.689
Look, you're not some rube
from Coos Bay anymore.

01:13:10.769 --> 01:13:13.954
Nobody's gonna wipe your behind,
warm your milk.

01:13:14.039 --> 01:13:16.599
We're past all that now.

01:13:16.675 --> 01:13:19.962
If you want to run, you run.

01:13:20.044 --> 01:13:23.696
If you don't,
then you walk away from it.

01:13:23.781 --> 01:13:27.638
Nobody can coach desire, Pre.

01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:49.492
Ellie!

01:14:02.418 --> 01:14:05.307
I like your hair that way.
It makes you look older.

01:14:05.388 --> 01:14:08.505
I mean, uh, in a good way.

01:14:10.593 --> 01:14:13.312
Yeah, you don't look like a boy
from Coos Bay anymore either.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.719
When we first came up here...

01:14:21.804 --> 01:14:25.422
I thought that was the way
it was gonna be.

01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:29.193
You and me, forever.

01:14:30.979 --> 01:14:35.495
Things definitely don't always turn
out the way you expect them to.

01:14:35.584 --> 01:14:38.200
You know?

01:14:39.988 --> 01:14:43.310
I've been reading about
your running in the paper.

01:14:43.392 --> 01:14:46.315
You're reading the sports pages?

01:14:46.394 --> 01:14:48.316
Yeah.

01:14:48.396 --> 01:14:52.947
After we broke up,
I resented it even more.

01:14:53.034 --> 01:14:56.390
I thought, if he hadn't
have done all that...

01:14:56.470 --> 01:15:00.361
then we would've just stayed in
Coos Bay and lived happily ever after.

01:15:03.244 --> 01:15:06.930
But then I watched your
Olympic race on TV...

01:15:08.249 --> 01:15:10.934
and I realized...

01:15:11.018 --> 01:15:13.805
it's really what you love.

01:15:15.188 --> 01:15:18.077
It's really who you are, Steve.

01:15:44.783 --> 01:15:48.503
Well, it took a while,
but Pre bounced back.

01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:53.642
Hell, he had a great senior year.

01:16:03.769 --> 01:16:07.216
Steve Prefontaine,
University of Oregon senior...

01:16:07.306 --> 01:16:09.456
wins his fourth straight
N.C.A.A. title...

01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:12.101
and breaks his own
American record again.

01:16:12.177 --> 01:16:14.736
But something was missing.

01:16:14.812 --> 01:16:17.326
You know?
Something was different.

01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:23.832
That spark he had before
Munich was gone.

01:16:23.922 --> 01:16:26.902
Although the words
may be ambiguous...

01:16:26.991 --> 01:16:29.607
Let me get another
one down here.

01:16:29.694 --> 01:16:32.481
Hey, it's not every day you get
big track stars serving beers.

01:16:32.563 --> 01:16:34.485
Hey, Pre, you still running?

01:16:34.565 --> 01:16:38.661
Of course he is, you idiot. He has to go
to Montreal and kick some serious butt.

01:16:38.736 --> 01:16:41.852
Put things right after what happened
in Munich. Right, Pre?

01:16:41.939 --> 01:16:43.952
Am I right, Pre?

01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:46.521
The transcripts themselves do
not make things perfectly clear.

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:49.226
- Get you something?
- A bottle of Bud.

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:55.497
I'm Mike O'Hara.

01:16:55.585 --> 01:16:58.008
There is testimony to support
John Dean's version...

01:16:58.088 --> 01:17:00.648
"To the President of the A.T.U.

01:17:00.724 --> 01:17:04.911
A representative of the new Professional
Track League has recently approached me. "

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:08.476
I'm prepared to offer you more
than I paid Keino, Ryun...

01:17:08.565 --> 01:17:12.352
Seagren and Lee Evans combined.

01:17:12.435 --> 01:17:14.892
Two hundred thousand dollars.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.726
Two hundred thousand?

01:17:19.809 --> 01:17:22.562
"I feel for me to continue now
as an amateur...

01:17:22.645 --> 01:17:25.125
"I must get the support
and experience...

01:17:25.214 --> 01:17:28.229
"I need to win in Montreal in '76.

01:17:28.317 --> 01:17:32.208
"I love my country, but does it
love me enough to allow me...

01:17:32.288 --> 01:17:36.679
"to compete in Finland
against my real competition?

01:17:36.759 --> 01:17:40.376
"Please let me have a chance
to become the best...

01:17:40.462 --> 01:17:43.147
"so I can bring home the gold.

01:17:43.231 --> 01:17:47.122
I'm waiting on your answer.
Sincerely, Steve Prefontaine. "

01:18:12.059 --> 01:18:13.981
Screw 'em!

01:18:14.061 --> 01:18:15.983
What's it say?

01:18:16.063 --> 01:18:19.510
They're gonna make me run
in Russia instead of Finland.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.251
Tell 'em to shove it and
go race Viren anyway.

01:18:22.336 --> 01:18:25.920
If I don't run their bullshit TV money
meets in Russia, Cunningham says...

01:18:26.006 --> 01:18:28.884
they're gonna suspend me from
any international competition

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:31.707
- for a whole goddamn year.
- What? - Yeah.

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:35.770
People say I should be running
for the gold in Montreal.

01:18:35.849 --> 01:18:38.601
For good old
"Red, White and Blue. "

01:18:38.684 --> 01:18:40.663
But where has it gotten me?

01:18:40.753 --> 01:18:44.678
Living hear on food stamps,
begging for crumbs from the A.T.U.

01:18:44.757 --> 01:18:48.944
I never protested.
I always saluted the flag.

01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:50.984
But what about at Montreal?

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:53.646
Right now I feel like saying,
to hell with Montreal.

01:18:53.733 --> 01:18:56.657
To hell with love of country.
I'm lookin' out for me.

01:18:56.736 --> 01:18:59.489
Right now I feel like saying,
to hell with Montreal.

01:18:59.572 --> 01:19:02.257
To hell with love of country.
I'm lookin' out for me.

01:19:02.341 --> 01:19:05.094
An angry Steve Prefontaine
lashes out...

01:19:05.178 --> 01:19:07.759
- Two beers.
- Don't want 'em.

01:19:07.846 --> 01:19:10.303
That's a buck.
You ordered 'em.

01:19:10.382 --> 01:19:13.237
- Changed my mind.
- It's okay. We can still pay.

01:19:13.318 --> 01:19:15.400
Forget that.
I'm leavin', man.

01:19:15.487 --> 01:19:17.569
To hell with the country, huh?

01:19:17.656 --> 01:19:20.580
Maybe he's just scared that he'll
tank again like he did in Munich.

01:19:20.659 --> 01:19:22.581
Well, to hell with him.

01:19:22.661 --> 01:19:24.640
- Hey, come on! Take it outside!
- I'll kill ya!

01:19:24.729 --> 01:19:26.913
You're a loser!

01:19:26.998 --> 01:19:28.920
Get the hell out!

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.560
You're goin'down, man!
You're a loser!

01:19:40.911 --> 01:19:43.596
What's wrong?

01:19:43.681 --> 01:19:46.434
Be honest with me.

01:19:46.517 --> 01:19:49.077
Out there at the meets...

01:19:49.153 --> 01:19:51.474
tell me the truth...

01:19:51.555 --> 01:19:54.240
do I still look like a runner?

01:19:54.325 --> 01:19:57.146
Oh, God, Steve.

01:19:57.228 --> 01:20:00.186
What is it?

01:20:02.867 --> 01:20:06.290
I keep thinking, uh...

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:09.293
what if I don't win
in Montreal?

01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:13.792
It's like...

01:20:13.877 --> 01:20:16.334
deep down...

01:20:16.412 --> 01:20:19.336
I want to turn pro
not for the money...

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:22.634
but so I'll never have
to face Viren again.

01:20:22.719 --> 01:20:25.643
Didn't you say once that when
a guy gives you his best shot...

01:20:25.722 --> 01:20:28.236
and you beat him anyway,
that you own him?

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.542
I didn't give him my
best shot in Munich.

01:20:30.627 --> 01:20:32.549
Exactly.

01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:36.883
He doesn't own me.
I got boxed in at the last turn.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:40.014
I know that.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.664
I can't beat Viren...

01:20:47.743 --> 01:20:50.598
if I can't race him, Nancy.

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:17.129
Hey, Pre! Pre!
How's your training going?

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.856
Why don't you guys go buy
somebody else for a change?

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:23.866
Are you anxious to get back to Europe this
summer and get another crack at Viren?

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:28.063
The only way I'm gonna get near Viren
is if he takes his summer vacation here.

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:32.073
Personally, I'd like to give Viren a
5,000-meter tour of Hayward Field.

01:21:35.055 --> 01:21:37.068
Listen up, Pre fans.

01:21:37.157 --> 01:21:39.580
Members of the
Finnish National Team...

01:21:39.659 --> 01:21:41.638
have formally accepted
an invitation...

01:21:41.728 --> 01:21:44.481
from Steve Prefontaine
to come and compete...

01:21:44.564 --> 01:21:47.818
against the Oregon Track Club
at Hayward Field this summer.

01:21:47.901 --> 01:21:50.153
Athletes can't go off
half-cocked...

01:21:50.237 --> 01:21:52.660
inviting foreign teams
into the U.S. for meets.

01:21:52.739 --> 01:21:54.661
Only the A.T.U. does that.

01:21:54.741 --> 01:21:56.925
What?
Go off half-cocked?

01:21:59.746 --> 01:22:02.999
We control the issuance of all
travel permits for the purpose...

01:22:03.082 --> 01:22:07.530
Travel permits of U.S. athletes,
not foreign. I've read the guidelines.

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:10.544
Well, if you, uh,
read the guidelines...

01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:13.774
then you know that if you promote
an unsanctioned meet...

01:22:13.859 --> 01:22:16.874
you can kiss your amateur
status good-bye.

01:22:19.698 --> 01:22:22.121
So, what's it gonna be?

01:22:23.369 --> 01:22:25.792
Race Viren in Oregon...

01:22:25.871 --> 01:22:29.295
or race him in Montreal?

01:22:29.375 --> 01:22:32.559
Is this America or what? How can
they threaten athletes like this?

01:22:32.644 --> 01:22:36.228
I just don't want to lose my
amateur status. I've worked hard.

01:22:36.314 --> 01:22:38.669
So you want to take on
the whole A.T.U.?

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:42.971
Yeah. We call their bluff,
plain and simple.

01:22:43.054 --> 01:22:45.909
Look, Mac...

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:48.447
do you want that Finn
discus guy or not?

01:22:48.526 --> 01:22:50.983
- I want Kahma.
- And I want Viren.

01:22:51.062 --> 01:22:54.987
This will be our only chance to
face those guys before Montreal.

01:22:55.066 --> 01:22:57.648
If we do this,
there won't be any Montreal.

01:22:57.735 --> 01:22:59.850
It's pretty risky, Pre.

01:22:59.936 --> 01:23:02.518
Hey, Pre, a little help here?

01:23:03.974 --> 01:23:06.556
I'm going ahead.

01:23:08.245 --> 01:23:10.998
You're either with
me or you're not.

01:23:14.117 --> 01:23:16.733
Two more beers, please.

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:19.072
Great.
Thanks.

01:23:31.467 --> 01:23:33.389
Jesus, Bill.

01:23:33.469 --> 01:23:35.391
Doc said it was a seizure.

01:23:35.471 --> 01:23:39.396
Guess I've sniffed too much
shoe glue over the years.

01:23:39.475 --> 01:23:42.228
I passed out right
here on the floor.

01:23:42.311 --> 01:23:44.529
Nerve damage, he says.

01:23:46.048 --> 01:23:48.266
You gotta stop with the shoes.

01:23:48.351 --> 01:23:52.242
I'm well-ventilated now.
Don't worry about me.

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:58.377
According to the newspapers,
you got plenty of worries of your own.

01:24:00.128 --> 01:24:03.484
A.T.U.'s making everybody
really nervous, Bill.

01:24:05.433 --> 01:24:07.481
I could use your help.

01:24:07.569 --> 01:24:09.992
I'm retired.

01:24:10.071 --> 01:24:13.154
Wait a second.
What did you used to say?

01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:16.722
"It's hard to slay a dragon
in his own backyard"?

01:24:16.811 --> 01:24:20.929
The A.T.U. will think twice
about defying you here.

01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:26.308
You're the one that's bigger
than the A.T.U. now.

01:24:26.387 --> 01:24:32.075
See if they have the balls to try to stop
Steve Prefontaine from going to Montreal.

01:24:32.159 --> 01:24:34.582
My quarter says they don't.

01:24:38.332 --> 01:24:41.722
We don't even have a sports
plan in this country.

01:24:41.802 --> 01:24:44.225
No sports medicine.

01:24:44.304 --> 01:24:46.886
No training facilities.

01:24:46.974 --> 01:24:49.659
After college, our best
amateur athletes...

01:24:49.743 --> 01:24:53.258
are put out to pasture and forgotten
about until the Olympics.

01:24:53.347 --> 01:24:57.601
And then you guys and America...

01:24:57.683 --> 01:25:01.471
wants to know,
where are the gold medals?

01:25:01.554 --> 01:25:07.140
Now, I'm not a greedy athlete
looking for a handout.

01:25:07.226 --> 01:25:11.913
I just turned down a lot of money
to chase the gold in Montreal...

01:25:11.998 --> 01:25:16.389
and, uh, and all I want...

01:25:16.469 --> 01:25:19.120
all we want...

01:25:19.205 --> 01:25:24.130
is a fighting chance
to fulfill our dreams.

01:25:24.209 --> 01:25:27.997
This meet is just one
small attempt by us...

01:25:28.079 --> 01:25:32.698
the athletes, to take control
of our own destinies.

01:25:32.784 --> 01:25:34.763
Pre!

01:25:34.853 --> 01:25:39.301
No.

01:25:40.859 --> 01:25:44.010
Okay, how are we picking up
the Finns from the airport?

01:25:44.095 --> 01:25:46.313
In my MG.

01:25:46.398 --> 01:25:48.821
A dozen athletes?

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:51.289
Ohh, I'll make a few trips.

01:25:51.369 --> 01:25:54.383
And I suppose the pole vault
poles will go in the trunk?

01:25:54.472 --> 01:25:56.622
- Hey.
- Hey, Mac.

01:25:56.707 --> 01:25:59.961
This just came in
down at the track.

01:26:02.246 --> 01:26:04.669
From the A.T.U.

01:26:07.218 --> 01:26:09.641
What now? Are they
sentencing me to prison?

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.575
A firing squad would be
more my recommendation.

01:26:20.865 --> 01:26:22.786
They caved.

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:26.113
The meet's sanctioned.

01:26:26.202 --> 01:26:28.386
Ha-ha!
Yes!

01:26:28.471 --> 01:26:30.723
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- All right!

01:26:30.807 --> 01:26:34.732
Nancy!
Yeah!

01:26:34.811 --> 01:26:36.733
Yeah?

01:26:36.813 --> 01:26:39.532
Hey, Yacco, how're you doin'?

01:26:39.616 --> 01:26:42.596
Mm-hmm.
Good news.

01:26:42.685 --> 01:26:45.370
Hey, Mac,you're gonna
get your shot.

01:26:45.455 --> 01:26:48.242
Pentti Kahma's definitely coming.

01:26:48.324 --> 01:26:50.645
Yeah!

01:26:50.727 --> 01:26:53.650
- All right, Mac.
- What's that?

01:26:59.635 --> 01:27:01.785
All right, thanks.

01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:04.794
Yeah, I'll talk to you soon.

01:27:11.213 --> 01:27:14.137
Viren's not coming.

01:27:14.216 --> 01:27:18.732
Yacco says he, uh,
strained a muscle.

01:27:24.692 --> 01:27:27.616
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

01:27:37.672 --> 01:27:41.927
Damn it! I should've known he'd
never run against me here!

01:27:42.009 --> 01:27:45.228
Screw the whole thing!

01:27:45.313 --> 01:27:48.202
- Steve. - Screw the whole
goddamn meet.

01:27:48.282 --> 01:27:51.535
People have bought plane tickets.
There are guys who are counting on this.

01:27:51.618 --> 01:27:53.734
Yeah?
Well, they'll live.

01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:08.455
Curtis Cunningham will have a
field day with this in the press.

01:28:08.535 --> 01:28:11.390
The son of a bitch
will rub my nose in it.

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:17.257
I never asked to lead the fight
against the A.T.U. anyway.

01:28:20.479 --> 01:28:22.458
Well, somebody better tell them.

01:28:36.495 --> 01:28:38.713
Oh, man.

01:28:45.004 --> 01:28:47.858
Ah, hell, the meet's still on.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:09.977
All I wanted was Viren.

01:29:11.329 --> 01:29:14.480
Well, Viren's not so
sure he wants you.

01:29:14.565 --> 01:29:17.146
Which should tell you...

01:29:17.234 --> 01:29:19.520
he doesn't own you.

01:29:41.725 --> 01:29:44.285
You ready to run?

01:29:44.361 --> 01:29:46.282
Bill.

01:29:46.362 --> 01:29:49.877
Can't run without proper shoes.

01:29:49.965 --> 01:29:52.081
That a one-piece toe?

01:29:52.168 --> 01:29:55.558
Yep. And they are
a thing of beauty.

01:29:55.638 --> 01:29:58.687
Piss it all.
Give me a second.

01:29:58.774 --> 01:30:00.958
What are you doing?

01:30:01.043 --> 01:30:04.331
- My new business partner.
- You got a business partner?

01:30:04.413 --> 01:30:07.564
Yeah, a former walk-on of mine
with average speed.

01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:09.902
Says when we put these
in production...

01:30:09.985 --> 01:30:12.965
we're gonna need a splashy logo
if we expect 'em to sell.

01:30:13.055 --> 01:30:15.705
What's that supposed to be?

01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:18.611
We're calling 'em
the Nike Swoosh.

01:30:18.693 --> 01:30:20.945
The what swoosh?

01:30:21.029 --> 01:30:23.145
His idea.

01:30:23.231 --> 01:30:25.847
Greek goddess of victory, 490 B.C.

01:30:25.934 --> 01:30:28.858
Well, it looks like needless
wind resistance to me.

01:30:28.937 --> 01:30:32.156
With us in the booth
for the first time ever...

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.858
former Duck coach and legend-in-residence,
Bill Bowerman.

01:30:35.944 --> 01:30:39.198
- Welcome, Bill.
- It's nice to be here, Wendy.

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.829
Down on the field,
Finland's Pentti Kahma...

01:30:42.916 --> 01:30:45.840
the top-ranked discus
thrower in the world.

01:30:50.023 --> 01:30:52.275
There's one heck of a toss, Bill.

01:30:54.361 --> 01:30:58.479
With a final throw of 211 feet,
four inches.

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:02.988
Uh... last up in the discus...

01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:06.494
now, um, Oregon's own Mac Wilkins.

01:31:06.573 --> 01:31:08.495
Hey, there's Pre!

01:31:08.575 --> 01:31:10.657
- There he is!
- Hey, Pre!

01:31:10.744 --> 01:31:13.098
- Pre!
- Pre!

01:31:15.548 --> 01:31:20.133
This will be Mac's final throw.
Currently in second place.

01:31:37.570 --> 01:31:41.084
Wilkins delivers his
best toss ever...

01:31:41.173 --> 01:31:43.858
212 feet, three inches.

01:31:43.942 --> 01:31:45.955
He wins the competition.

01:31:46.044 --> 01:31:49.525
And he establishes a new
Hayward Field record.

01:31:49.614 --> 01:31:53.061
For today, Mac Wilkins is the
best discus man in the world.

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:10.813
Hold this for me until
the end of the race.

01:32:10.901 --> 01:32:12.755
Good luck, Steve.

01:32:12.837 --> 01:32:14.759
Go get 'em, son.

01:32:14.839 --> 01:32:16.921
Hi.

01:32:21.512 --> 01:32:24.072
Do I look like a runner?

01:32:28.953 --> 01:32:31.035
This will be the final event...

01:32:31.121 --> 01:32:34.010
of today's first annual
Finn/Oregon Meet.

01:32:34.091 --> 01:32:36.013
5,000 meters.

01:32:36.093 --> 01:32:38.414
Ah, what the hell.

01:32:40.797 --> 01:32:43.220
Thanks for coming and
bailing me out, Shorter.

01:32:43.299 --> 01:32:45.221
I love sticking it to the A.T.U.

01:32:45.301 --> 01:32:47.451
Are you going to the
party tonight?

01:32:47.537 --> 01:32:50.188
- Runners to your mark.
- I guess so.

01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:52.833
I'll see you there.

01:32:59.048 --> 01:33:02.302
With two laps to go,
Pre makes his move.

01:33:10.759 --> 01:33:14.013
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:33:14.096 --> 01:33:16.815
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

01:33:16.899 --> 01:33:18.617
Go, Steve!

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:21.157
Come on!
Come on!

01:33:21.236 --> 01:33:24.091
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:33:26.241 --> 01:33:30.792
I hope you people at home realize
what a rare runner this man is.

01:33:37.585 --> 01:33:41.976
The kind a coach sees
only once in a lifetime.

01:33:42.056 --> 01:33:45.605
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:33:47.561 --> 01:33:50.041
Come on, Steve!
Go, son!

01:33:50.415 --> 01:33:53.352
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:56.803
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:28.447
Hey, Mac, you really
kicked Kahma's ass today.

01:34:28.535 --> 01:34:31.151
I couldn't have done it
without this meet.

01:34:31.237 --> 01:34:34.422
- # Once you get started #
- You know something?

01:34:34.507 --> 01:34:37.430
It's like all those years,
to me...

01:34:37.509 --> 01:34:39.795
you were just a talented
little jerk.

01:34:39.878 --> 01:34:42.164
I'm serious.
You were a jerk.

01:34:42.247 --> 01:34:44.602
I never understood you.

01:34:44.683 --> 01:34:47.106
It took me a while too.

01:34:47.186 --> 01:34:49.268
Well, now I do.

01:34:49.355 --> 01:34:52.142
I live and breathe the discus, Pre.

01:34:52.224 --> 01:34:54.510
I mean, I hate Christmas...

01:34:54.593 --> 01:34:56.879
and Thanksgiving and Easter...

01:34:56.962 --> 01:34:59.112
and anything that
disrupts my routine.

01:34:59.198 --> 01:35:03.453
It worked for you today, man.
You beat the best.

01:35:03.535 --> 01:35:06.514
Didn't always work for me.

01:35:06.604 --> 01:35:09.289
Yeah, well, you aren't done yet.

01:35:09.374 --> 01:35:11.695
No, I'm not.

01:35:14.779 --> 01:35:18.465
# Once you get started #

01:35:18.549 --> 01:35:20.369
# Oh, it's hard to stop #

01:35:20.451 --> 01:35:23.875
Everybody shut up, will you?

01:35:25.957 --> 01:35:28.915
I think we should all raise our
glasses to our Finnish guests...

01:35:28.993 --> 01:35:31.644
for coming and making the
meet such a great success.

01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:34.879
Hear!
Hear!

01:35:34.965 --> 01:35:37.752
And, uh, to my roommate Pre.

01:35:40.971 --> 01:35:42.984
Some guys win races.

01:35:43.073 --> 01:35:46.657
Other guys watch and
learn and pass it on.

01:35:46.743 --> 01:35:49.894
I never thought I'd learn so much
from a guy from Coos Bay.

01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:52.767
But I did.

01:35:52.849 --> 01:35:57.104
And, uh, I've enjoyed
every damn minute.

01:35:57.187 --> 01:36:00.167
So... to Steve.

01:36:00.257 --> 01:36:02.816
To Steve.

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.944
Well, this was a team effort...

01:36:07.029 --> 01:36:11.420
and thanks to everybody here
who helped put this together.

01:36:13.469 --> 01:36:17.565
There's a feeling I got today
unlike any other.

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:20.393
I guess, uh...

01:36:22.144 --> 01:36:25.898
I guess it's what I thought
Munich would be.

01:36:29.652 --> 01:36:32.006
I'm so glad we did this.

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:38.208
Way to go, World.

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:40.909
- Yeah.
- Way to go, Steve.

01:36:43.965 --> 01:36:48.891
# They say every man
needs protection #

01:36:51.306 --> 01:36:56.733
# They say that
every man must fall #

01:36:59.948 --> 01:37:04.532
# Yet I swear I see
my reflection #

01:37:07.187 --> 01:37:12.045
# Somewhere so high
above this wall #

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:17.350
# I see my life... #

01:37:36.182 --> 01:37:39.003
Jesus Christ!
Come on! Hold on!

01:37:39.085 --> 01:37:42.202
- Can't breathe.
- Hold on, kid. I'll get you.

01:37:42.288 --> 01:37:45.041
Somebody help me!

01:37:50.463 --> 01:37:53.284
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get help.

01:39:02.065 --> 01:39:06.081
He's dead, and that's final.

01:39:06.169 --> 01:39:11.027
No amount of misery or suffering
by me is gonna bring him back.

01:39:11.107 --> 01:39:13.826
I remember realizing that...

01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:18.358
I had kind of settled for things
since we had broken up.

01:39:18.448 --> 01:39:21.269
And he never did that.

01:39:26.688 --> 01:39:30.112
I looked at him at that party
that night, and I thought...

01:39:30.192 --> 01:39:34.117
he's gonna make a great
husband, father.

01:39:36.965 --> 01:39:39.889
The best time in my life
was my time with him.

01:39:46.375 --> 01:39:48.889
Well, let's be honest.
I mean, the only reason...

01:39:48.977 --> 01:39:53.835
that we're sitting here talking about Pre
right now is because Pre was a winner.

01:39:53.915 --> 01:39:56.565
People need winners.

01:39:56.651 --> 01:39:59.575
Pre went to Munich to win.

01:39:59.654 --> 01:40:02.976
In Montreal, by God,
he would have.

01:40:10.831 --> 01:40:12.913
I woke up the morning
after the meet.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.252
I was out of my bed like a bull.

01:40:15.336 --> 01:40:18.260
I ran down to the corner
to buy me a paper.

01:40:18.339 --> 01:40:21.263
I took enough money
to buy ten copies.

01:40:21.342 --> 01:40:24.265
I had beaten Pentti Kahma.

01:40:26.279 --> 01:40:28.759
I mean, this was gonna be
my sports page today.

01:40:28.848 --> 01:40:31.305
It was my big moment.

01:40:35.522 --> 01:40:38.446
Then I just saw it
all over the papers.

01:40:42.529 --> 01:40:44.850
You know what my
first thought was?

01:40:44.931 --> 01:40:48.116
"That son of a bitch found
a way to beat me again. "

01:40:51.037 --> 01:40:54.483
Pre ran every race as
though it were his last.

01:40:56.542 --> 01:40:58.760
This is his last.

01:41:04.416 --> 01:41:07.840
This is the bell lap for
Steve Prefontaine.

01:41:15.294 --> 01:41:17.910
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:41:17.996 --> 01:41:19.952
Go, Pre!

01:41:20.032 --> 01:41:23.149
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:41:23.634 --> 01:41:26.743
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:41:27.372 --> 01:41:30.570
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:41:31.042 --> 01:41:34.198
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:41:34.545 --> 01:41:38.082
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:41:38.416 --> 01:41:43.570
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

01:42:37.006 --> 01:42:40.590

keep you always #

ladder to the stars #

01:42:57.792 --> 01:43:00.249
# And climb on every rung #

01:43:00.328 --> 01:43:02.649

# May you grow up
to be true #

01:43:44.104 --> 01:43:47.118
# May you always
know the truth #

01:43:47.206 --> 01:43:50.255
# And see the light
surrounding you #

01:43:54.647 --> 01:43:58.071
# May you always
be courageous #

01:43:58.150 --> 01:44:00.835

# May your hands
always be busy #

01:44:41.593 --> 01:44:44.641
# May your feet
always be swift #

01:44:44.728 --> 01:44:47.652
# May you have a
strong foundation #

01:44:47.731 --> 01:44:51.019
# When the winds
of changes shift #

01:44:55.172 --> 01:44:58.619
# May your heart
always be joyful #

01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:01.462
