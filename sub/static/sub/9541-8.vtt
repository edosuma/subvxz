Ooh!

[Applause]

00:22.408 --> 00:23.508
[Gasps]

00:23.576 --> 00:25.577
Hmm? Huh? Huh?

00:25.644 --> 00:28.980
I still don't get why some people
insist on dressing like pirates

00:29.048 --> 00:30.315
at a faire for knights.

00:30.383 --> 00:31.516
Because knights are boring.

00:31.584 --> 00:34.252
They're so, "milord this"
and "milady that."

00:34.320 --> 00:36.821
"Joust me!
Ooh, I've got the pox!"

00:36.889 --> 00:39.224
Pirates, on the other hand,
are awesome.

00:39.291 --> 00:40.625
Yarr!

00:42.661 --> 00:44.662
I got to fix this thing.

00:48.167 --> 00:50.168
[Grunting]

00:50.236 --> 00:52.137
Hmm? Huh?

00:53.539 --> 00:54.906
Hello?

I, lord Barry, welcome thee
to the royal knights faire.

01:56.502 --> 01:58.936
Huzzah.
More filthy pirates.

01:59.004 --> 02:01.873
Go hang out
at a seafood restaurant.

02:06.011 --> 02:09.013
Lord Barry's got to relax
about letting pirates mix

02:09.080 --> 02:10.348
with the knights and damsels.

02:10.414 --> 02:13.718
I told him not to worry
about historical inaccuracies.

02:13.786 --> 02:15.386
More people, more money.

02:15.454 --> 02:16.554
Ow!

02:16.622 --> 02:17.989
Quiet, fool.

02:18.056 --> 02:21.325
All faire should be kept
historically untainted.

02:21.393 --> 02:25.897
Otherwise, who knows what sort of
shambling low-lives will arrive.

02:25.964 --> 02:29.734
- Peg-leg shaggy says,
"arr, shiver me timbers,

02:29.802 --> 02:32.069
"and, like, break out
the barbecue turkey legs

02:32.137 --> 02:33.738
and the mutton kebabs."

02:33.806 --> 02:36.908
- Aye-aye,
peg-leg shaggy, sir.

02:36.975 --> 02:38.843
Any way a girl could dock here?

02:38.911 --> 02:44.348
Aye, but only if ye be in wench
garb and talking all piratey.

02:44.416 --> 02:47.685
- Yo-ho-ho
and a bottle of root beer.

02:47.753 --> 02:49.887
[Giggles]

02:49.955 --> 02:52.957
Let's see. I'm thinking of
a word that rhymes with

02:53.025 --> 02:56.093
"no way I'm putting on
those dumb clothes."

02:56.161 --> 02:59.263
Man, oh, man!
This knights faire thing is awesome.

02:59.331 --> 03:01.132
We got to check out
black plague village.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.367
I hear they've got
a 6-foot-deep man trap

03:03.435 --> 03:05.536
filled with wild musk hogs.

03:05.604 --> 03:08.105
Freddy,
did you notice my outfit?

03:10.142 --> 03:11.342
[Laughs]

03:11.410 --> 03:13.444
I don't even understand
that question.

03:13.512 --> 03:15.513
Hey, guys, look at this.

03:16.615 --> 03:19.483
And it had horrible,
glowing green hair.

03:19.551 --> 03:20.985
[Sniffling] Right.

03:21.053 --> 03:22.653
Now, did this thing leave
a name?

03:22.721 --> 03:24.989
Or a business card?

03:25.057 --> 03:28.326
Mayor Jones, sheriff,
what happened here?

03:28.393 --> 03:31.028
Nothing unusual.
Just a standard scary gnome attack.

03:31.096 --> 03:33.564
Aren't gnomes the things
people put in their gardens?

03:33.632 --> 03:35.399
Posies and pinwheels, Fred.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.068
Those gnomes are
peaceful creatures.

03:37.135 --> 03:39.403
Scary gnomes are something
very different,

03:39.471 --> 03:42.240
and good for tourism.
So stay out of this.

03:42.307 --> 03:44.976
[Crying]

03:46.478 --> 03:50.248
Hear ye, hear ye.
Get your cotton candy clams,

03:50.315 --> 03:52.283
just like king Richard
used to eat.

03:52.351 --> 03:54.852
Oh, who am I kidding?

03:54.920 --> 03:57.188
I thought the gnome would
attack me,

03:57.256 --> 03:59.190
but it waddled back
into the shadows.

03:59.258 --> 04:01.425
Never made a sound.

04:02.928 --> 04:04.428
This is surprisingly bad.

04:04.496 --> 04:07.765
Arr!
A mystery fair and true.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.767
Best we be to avoid it.

04:09.835 --> 04:11.669
What says ye, dogbeard?

04:11.737 --> 04:14.505
Aye. Scary gnomes, no.

04:14.573 --> 04:17.507
More cotton candy clam, aye.

04:17.576 --> 04:19.110
[Giggles]

04:19.177 --> 04:21.779
[Grunts]

04:21.846 --> 04:24.582
So its touch paralyzed?

04:24.650 --> 04:27.351
For some reason, that doesn't
seem like a gnome power.

04:27.419 --> 04:29.520
Goblin, maybe,
or perhaps a sprite.

04:29.588 --> 04:30.788
Well, whatever it was,

04:30.856 --> 04:32.456
it's going to be up to us
to find it.

04:32.524 --> 04:37.128
Oh, Fred. You sound so noble
when you say that. Mmm.

04:37.195 --> 04:39.964
My mom is running the souvenir
stand at the ice cream moat.

04:40.032 --> 04:41.465
She might know something.

04:41.533 --> 04:43.801
Care to come along,
peg-leg?

04:43.869 --> 04:45.636
- Hoo-hoo! Arr!

04:45.671 --> 04:48.673
Like, dogbeard and me can
always go for ice cream!

04:48.740 --> 04:51.709
Yeah, with peanuts
and cherries. Ooh.

04:51.777 --> 04:57.048
Arr, I mean,
crossbones and eyeballs.

04:57.115 --> 04:58.849
Arrgh!

05:01.086 --> 05:05.389
Is it me, or are pirates basically
just hoboes with earrings?

05:05.457 --> 05:08.225
Well, I guess
that just leaves us.

05:08.293 --> 05:10.394
Looks like it, my fair maiden.

05:10.462 --> 05:12.563
Hey, are those lepers?

05:12.631 --> 05:15.132
[Sighs]

05:21.006 --> 05:22.606
[Gulping]

05:22.674 --> 05:25.376
Ahh. Mmm!
Nothing like good moat.

05:25.444 --> 05:28.546
I'll say.
[belches] Whoops.

05:28.613 --> 05:30.548
Look at him, mom.
Is it me?

05:30.615 --> 05:32.149
What am I, radioactive?

05:32.217 --> 05:34.151
Don't be too hard
on yourself, Velma.

05:34.219 --> 05:37.788
You're quite pleasant when you aren't
trying to be smarter than everyone else.

05:37.856 --> 05:39.457
But I really care about him,

05:39.524 --> 05:41.292
and I want him
to care about me.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.227
It will happen, sweetheart.

05:43.295 --> 05:46.464
And if it doesn't, mommy will
mix him up a special drink

05:46.531 --> 05:48.466
of poison mushrooms
and wormwood.

05:48.533 --> 05:49.633
Mom!

05:49.701 --> 05:50.968
[Laughs] Kidding!

05:51.036 --> 05:53.137
Anyway, about your scary gnome,

05:53.205 --> 05:54.505
this should help.

05:54.573 --> 05:56.974
"I'm okay...
you're a scary gnome."

05:57.042 --> 05:58.376
Read it.

05:58.443 --> 05:59.910
One thing I can tell you
for sure...

05:59.978 --> 06:02.313
if it is a scary gnome
you're dealing with,

06:02.381 --> 06:05.383
watch out.
They hold grudges.

06:09.755 --> 06:12.156
Gah. That queen was
a royal jerk.

06:12.224 --> 06:14.992
Yeah. I said "ahoy, ahoy"
in my pirate voice,

06:15.060 --> 06:18.996
and she stared at me like I was
wearing a hat made of live mice.

06:19.064 --> 06:21.365
Dude, if I ever found
a hat like that,

06:21.433 --> 06:22.767
I'd never take it off.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.301
- [Cackling]
- Huh?

06:24.369 --> 06:27.571
[Cackling continues]

06:31.343 --> 06:33.511

06:37.215 --> 06:38.549

06:43.088 --> 06:45.222
[Screaming continues]

06:46.691 --> 06:48.059
[Panting]

06:48.126 --> 06:51.228
[Both scream]

06:51.296 --> 06:54.065
[Grunting and panting]

06:59.037 --> 07:01.539
[Screaming]

07:05.710 --> 07:07.478
[Panting]

07:09.681 --> 07:11.348
Mommy!

07:18.802 --> 07:21.404
These attacks could really
wipe out business.

07:21.471 --> 07:23.239
- [Growls]
- Or not.

07:23.307 --> 07:24.674
We'll be fine.

07:24.741 --> 07:27.009
Only wretched pirates
are being assaulted.

07:27.077 --> 07:28.578
Let's get back to the faire.

07:28.645 --> 07:30.813
Hmm.

07:33.116 --> 07:34.550
So, what do you say now, dad?

07:34.618 --> 07:37.053
Looks like that scary gnome
needs investigating.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.722
For once, Fred,
I agree with you.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.692
- You do?
- Absolutely. For instance,

07:42.759 --> 07:45.027
can it play popular tunes
on a bank of horns?

07:45.095 --> 07:46.529
Can it ride a motorcycle
in a circle?

07:46.597 --> 07:49.031
Can it spin like a top
on its pointy cone head?

07:49.099 --> 07:50.866
All things
we need to investigate.

07:50.934 --> 07:54.203
Right, so stop wasting
our time, punk!

07:54.271 --> 07:56.606
Sorry, sorry.
I just get excited.

08:08.085 --> 08:10.119
So, what did you find out
from your mom, Velma?

08:10.187 --> 08:12.154
There's lots of info on gnomes,

08:12.222 --> 08:14.657
but nothing about attacks
on pirates.

08:14.725 --> 08:16.826
They like gems,
possess weak magic,

08:16.893 --> 08:19.829
and while some gnomes are good
and helpful to animals,

08:19.896 --> 08:22.164
others are evil
and rumored to work as managers

08:22.232 --> 08:24.066
in the shady world
of faerie wrestling.

08:24.134 --> 08:26.068
Maybe our gnome dropped this.

08:26.136 --> 08:28.404
I found it in the hand
of one of the pirate nerds.

08:28.472 --> 08:29.739
Way to go, Daph!

08:29.806 --> 08:31.574
We find out
who has the other one,

08:31.642 --> 08:32.908
we find our gnome.

08:32.976 --> 08:34.076
Arrgh.

08:34.144 --> 08:36.412
Perhaps Peter squawk knows
a tale or two

08:36.480 --> 08:38.581
about this here scary gnome.

08:38.649 --> 08:40.750
What say ye, Pete?

08:40.817 --> 08:42.985
[Imitates cawing]

08:44.821 --> 08:46.922
[Both laugh]

08:46.990 --> 08:49.292
He knows something!

08:49.359 --> 08:50.960
For the sake of those two,

08:51.028 --> 08:54.196
we better hope the whole
pirate thing is a coincidence.

08:56.233 --> 08:57.667
[Screams]

08:57.734 --> 08:59.402

[Siren]

09:17.187 --> 09:19.989
[Clicking]

09:23.560 --> 09:25.261
Just put him in any open chair.

09:25.329 --> 09:27.263
We're out of room
at the hospital.

09:27.331 --> 09:30.433
And watch those refillable sodas, boys.
You're on duty.

09:30.500 --> 09:35.004
The little creep clearly has
it in for scurvy scalawags.

09:35.072 --> 09:38.607
No admittance.
This is a quarantined area.

09:38.675 --> 09:40.209
Besides,
the movie's already started.

09:40.277 --> 09:42.845
You're showing them a movie?

09:42.913 --> 09:46.215
Yeah. Aren't they, like,
frozen with gnomey magic?

09:46.283 --> 09:47.883
I already saw the movie.

09:47.951 --> 09:49.885
Believe me, magically frozen is

09:49.953 --> 09:52.621
the perfect viewing state
to be in.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.864
You guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

10:01.932 --> 10:02.965
Double feature?

10:03.033 --> 10:04.800
No. We need to get in there

10:04.868 --> 10:06.869
and run some tests
on those pirates.

10:06.937 --> 10:10.373
- Arrgh. Like, perhaps
old dogbeard and peg-leg shaggy

10:10.440 --> 10:13.409
should stay outside
and guard the concession stand.

10:13.477 --> 10:15.544
[Growls]

10:15.612 --> 10:18.214
What are you talking about?

10:18.281 --> 10:19.482
You said you loved me.

10:19.549 --> 10:21.984
I did,
but that was before I decided

10:22.052 --> 10:24.387
to hit the road with Larry
and start a mariachi band.

10:24.454 --> 10:26.722
But Larry is a schnauzer!

10:26.790 --> 10:28.958
I so know how she feels.

10:31.261 --> 10:32.895
Ahh. Here's a good one.

10:32.963 --> 10:36.298
Stand back.
This is going to get awesome.

10:37.334 --> 10:39.435
[Drilling]

10:39.503 --> 10:41.270
Is everything ok, Velma?

10:41.338 --> 10:43.639
Shaggy and I have been
seeing each other.

10:43.707 --> 10:47.910
I knew it!
Oh, Velma, I'm so happy for you!

10:47.978 --> 10:50.079
Or not.

10:50.147 --> 10:52.214
I want to be with him.

10:52.282 --> 10:53.716
Then he does something stupid.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.484
Then I hate myself
for liking him.

10:55.552 --> 10:56.719
Then I miss him.

10:56.787 --> 10:59.622
Then I see him again.
Then he does something stupid.

10:59.689 --> 11:03.125
Oh, you are so completely
living my life.

11:03.193 --> 11:05.961
I mean, ohh, sorry.

11:06.029 --> 11:07.563
You guys having a lady talk?

11:07.631 --> 11:09.331
Oh! Don't leave me out!

11:09.399 --> 11:12.735
Go ahead. Tell him.
Things can't get any worse.

11:12.803 --> 11:14.970
Velma is having
a relationship with shaggy,

11:15.038 --> 11:17.206
and she's frustrated because
her affections aren't returned

11:17.274 --> 11:18.974
in the same measure
that they're given!

11:21.478 --> 11:22.778
Crazy, huh?

11:22.846 --> 11:25.681
Look, Velma,
you're complicating things.

11:25.749 --> 11:27.683
Why have a separate relationship
with shaggy

11:27.751 --> 11:31.120
when the 5 of us already have
this awesome relationship?

11:31.188 --> 11:32.955
Just try and relax.

11:33.023 --> 11:35.925
We have the rest of our lives
together to work out any problems.

11:35.992 --> 11:38.828
Besides,
I think I found something.

11:41.364 --> 11:42.798
[Gulping]

11:42.866 --> 11:46.302
My test indicates the goo is
a jellyfish toxin.

11:46.369 --> 11:47.970
Jellyfish toxin?

11:48.038 --> 11:49.305
Precisely.

11:49.372 --> 11:51.807
And it causes
instant paralysis.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.976
The effect should only last
a few days.

11:54.044 --> 11:57.746
Like, just long enough for the royal
knights faire to be over tomorrow.

11:57.814 --> 11:59.148
[Gulps]

11:59.216 --> 12:02.418
So our only clues are
jellyfish toxin and an earring.

12:02.486 --> 12:03.986
That's not much to work with.

12:04.054 --> 12:07.122
Which means we better kick this
investigation into high gear.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.358
[Engine starts]

12:12.796 --> 12:15.231
- [Giggles] Like,
now's our chance, Scooby-Doo.

12:15.298 --> 12:17.500
While the rest of the gang
is off scary gnome-hunting,

12:17.567 --> 12:20.236
the faire's delicious delights
are all ours.

12:20.303 --> 12:21.737
[Giggles]

12:21.805 --> 12:25.074
I want to run something
through with a spear.

12:25.141 --> 12:29.578
I say, good riddance
to those sea scum.

12:29.646 --> 12:31.580
Is he talking about us?

12:31.648 --> 12:34.250
I never let pirates in
when I ran things.

12:34.317 --> 12:36.619
You ran things
into the ground, you silly tot.

12:36.686 --> 12:38.854
That's why I'm in charge.

12:38.922 --> 12:41.991
Yes, married the rich queen,
didn't you?

12:42.058 --> 12:45.494
Well, we'll see how long
you stay in charge.

13:00.644 --> 13:02.311
Like, there's his gnome suit.

13:02.379 --> 13:04.480
[Whimpers]
We got to get out of here!

13:04.548 --> 13:05.948
Wait, look!

13:06.016 --> 13:08.217
Arr! Arr! Arr!

13:08.285 --> 13:09.885
I'm a secret pirate!

13:09.953 --> 13:12.121
I'm a secret pirate!

13:12.188 --> 13:13.789
[Laughs] Swish!

13:13.857 --> 13:16.058
[Laughs] Avast ye, me hearties!

13:16.126 --> 13:18.460
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
I'm a swashbuckler, I am!

13:18.528 --> 13:22.464
Like, wow. That is something
I didn't need to see.

13:22.532 --> 13:24.967
My brain needs a shower.

13:25.035 --> 13:26.468
Hmm?

13:26.536 --> 13:29.204
- [Cackling]
- [Both scream and whimper]

13:29.272 --> 13:30.973
[Cackling]

13:31.041 --> 13:33.208
[Both screaming and whimpering]

13:37.080 --> 13:38.047
[Giggles]

13:38.114 --> 13:39.648
[Screaming]

13:39.716 --> 13:42.117
- Get the rest of the gang
and save yourself, Scooby-Doo!

13:42.185 --> 13:43.285
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:43.353 --> 13:45.321
Ow!

13:45.388 --> 13:47.723
[Scooby whimpering]

13:48.758 --> 13:50.926
[Growls]

13:53.763 --> 13:57.199
[Laughs]

14:07.322 --> 14:10.090
[Groans]

14:10.158 --> 14:13.093
[Whimpers and cries]

14:13.161 --> 14:15.929
- Scooby-Doo,
just have a bite of boar.

14:15.997 --> 14:17.264
It will make you feel better.

14:17.332 --> 14:21.335
Ohh, it doesn't feel right
without Raggy.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.438
Where's my Raggy?

14:24.505 --> 14:26.606
[Weeping]

14:26.674 --> 14:28.608
- [Humming]
- Ohh?

14:28.676 --> 14:31.011
[Humming continues]

14:31.079 --> 14:32.679
[Growls]

14:32.747 --> 14:33.747
Mmm!

14:33.815 --> 14:35.215
[Growls]

14:35.283 --> 14:37.050
Hey, cut it out!

14:37.118 --> 14:39.986
- [Growls]
- Ohh! No!

14:42.423 --> 14:44.024
I miss him, too.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.258
Nyah.

14:45.326 --> 14:46.927
It doesn't make sense.

14:46.994 --> 14:48.428
How does the gnome
keep vanishing?

14:48.496 --> 14:51.398
[Cell phone rings]
[metal clanks]

14:51.466 --> 14:52.799
Mr. e.?

14:52.867 --> 14:54.234
[Beeps]

14:54.302 --> 14:57.404
Hello, mystery, incorporated.

14:57.472 --> 14:59.239
- Oh!
- Listen to me, you creep.

14:59.307 --> 15:01.808
If you know anything
about what happened to shaggy...

15:01.876 --> 15:05.345
well, it's lovely speaking
to you, too, Velma.

15:05.413 --> 15:08.815
I'm afraid I can't tell you
where shaggy is,

15:08.883 --> 15:10.650
but I can tell you this...

15:10.718 --> 15:13.820
begin your search at the end.

15:13.888 --> 15:17.758
Enjoy the rest of the faire.
[clicks]

15:17.825 --> 15:19.292
Begin at the end?

15:19.360 --> 15:20.460
Scooby!

15:20.528 --> 15:22.295
[Snarls]

15:22.363 --> 15:23.797
Hold on. Truce.

15:23.865 --> 15:24.965
I just want to know,

15:25.032 --> 15:27.401
where was the last place
you saw shaggy?

15:27.468 --> 15:28.969
Hmm.

15:31.005 --> 15:33.440
This was the last place
I saw Raggy.

15:33.508 --> 15:36.176
All right, gang.
You heard him. Start looking.

15:36.244 --> 15:38.078
[Clicks]

15:45.887 --> 15:47.554
[Screams] [thuds]

15:48.823 --> 15:51.658
- Way to go,
danger-prone Daphne.

15:53.528 --> 15:55.595
Hey, gang, check it out.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.930
What are we waiting for?

15:56.998 --> 15:59.833
Raggy? Raggy!

16:05.940 --> 16:08.275
It's like
a tree expressway up here.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.945
We could walk all around the
park and never be seen.

16:12.013 --> 16:15.115
Looks like we found Mr.
Scary gnome's private highway.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.852
And that means finally,
it's trap time.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.754
[Sniffs]

16:35.837 --> 16:38.371
What are we going to use
for scary gnome bait?

16:38.439 --> 16:41.775
The one thing
a scary gnome can't resist...

16:41.843 --> 16:43.276
A pirate.

16:43.344 --> 16:45.078
[Sighs]

16:45.146 --> 16:47.614
Remember, Scooby,
you're doing this for shaggy.

16:47.682 --> 16:51.184
- Scooby-Dooby-arrgh!

16:52.386 --> 16:53.720
Is Daphne back yet?

16:53.788 --> 16:56.556
She said something
about needing bracelets.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.592
We're all set.

17:00.995 --> 17:02.395
Hmm?

17:02.463 --> 17:04.897
Hmm.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.068
Phew.

17:08.135 --> 17:09.368
[Growls and cackles]

17:09.436 --> 17:10.369
[Screams]

17:10.438 --> 17:12.038
[Chuckles]

17:12.106 --> 17:13.406
Huh?

17:13.473 --> 17:14.907
[Growls]

17:14.976 --> 17:18.278
[Grunting and laughing]

17:18.346 --> 17:20.747
He's making a run for it!
Let's cut him off!

17:20.815 --> 17:22.249
Come on, Scooby!

17:22.316 --> 17:24.251
Wait for me!

17:25.987 --> 17:29.089
[Giggling]

17:30.992 --> 17:34.494
Fred? Velma? Daphne?

17:35.830 --> 17:37.264
Raggy!

17:37.331 --> 17:40.066
[Grunting]

17:43.638 --> 17:45.572
[Growls]

17:45.640 --> 17:48.909
- Scooby-Doo!
Like, am I ever glad to see you!

17:48.976 --> 17:50.243
Likewise!

17:50.311 --> 17:52.212
[Creaking]

17:52.280 --> 17:55.382
[Both gasp and scream]

17:58.719 --> 18:01.454
[Cackling]

18:06.160 --> 18:08.662
[Grunts]

18:08.729 --> 18:10.530
Whoa! Oof!

18:12.133 --> 18:13.400
[Growls]

18:13.467 --> 18:14.534
[Gasps]

18:14.602 --> 18:16.136
[Grunts]

18:18.005 --> 18:19.105
Hmm!

18:19.173 --> 18:21.441
[Grunts and giggles]

18:21.509 --> 18:23.610
I figured if the toxin
is passed by touch,

18:23.678 --> 18:26.613
let him touch some steel.

18:26.681 --> 18:28.848
[Screeches and laughs]

18:32.019 --> 18:33.954
[Groans and spits]

18:34.021 --> 18:35.689
[Coughs]

18:35.756 --> 18:39.125
Ahh. Frolicking in her
majesty's filth pit, are ye?

18:39.193 --> 18:41.995
Begone from there,
you miserable pirates.

18:42.063 --> 18:43.930
[All groan]

18:43.998 --> 18:45.765
[Laughs]

18:45.833 --> 18:48.335
He's headed
toward the entrance!

18:48.402 --> 18:51.171
Stop that gnome!

18:51.238 --> 18:53.073
[Grunting and laughing]

18:53.140 --> 18:54.240
[Indistinct shout]

18:58.479 --> 19:00.780
[Grunting]

19:00.848 --> 19:02.182
[All scream]

19:02.249 --> 19:04.184
[Laughing]

19:04.251 --> 19:06.753
Ow! Oof!

19:07.822 --> 19:10.056
[Clanks]

19:13.160 --> 19:14.294
[Grunts]

19:14.362 --> 19:16.863
Now let's see
who you really are.

19:16.931 --> 19:18.365
[All gasp]

19:18.432 --> 19:20.834
The court fool?

19:21.836 --> 19:24.638
That's my husband,
Gill Littlefoot!

19:24.705 --> 19:27.173
What did you think
you were doing, fool?

19:27.241 --> 19:29.275
What I've wanted to do
for years...

19:29.343 --> 19:30.610
frame you
for the gnome attacks.

19:30.678 --> 19:32.112
And once you were
out of the way,

19:32.179 --> 19:34.614
take your fortune for my own.

19:34.682 --> 19:36.950
Ow!
Will you stop that?

19:37.018 --> 19:38.685
But you're too tall.

19:38.753 --> 19:39.986
How could you ever be
the gnome?

19:40.054 --> 19:43.189
There's a reason
our family name is Littlefoot.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.059
[All gasp]

19:46.127 --> 19:48.495
I planned this over a year.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.231
And while I've always hid
my tiny legs,

19:51.298 --> 19:55.468
this finally provided me
a way to make them useful.

19:55.536 --> 19:58.138
Since Amanda's dislike of
pirates was well known,

19:58.205 --> 20:00.540
I planted her earring
on a victim,

20:00.608 --> 20:02.709
hoping to throw suspicion
her way.

20:02.777 --> 20:07.047
I used my toxin-coated gloves
to paralyze all the pirates,

20:07.114 --> 20:10.050
but you would not quit.

20:10.117 --> 20:12.986
The beautiful part is
that because of my...

20:13.054 --> 20:15.889
I believe the medical term
is baby legs.

20:15.956 --> 20:18.558
No one would have ever
suspected me.

20:18.626 --> 20:22.729
That is, until you meddling,
gnome-hating, pirate-loving...

20:22.797 --> 20:24.664
yeah, yeah, shrimpo,
we got the picture.

20:24.732 --> 20:27.834
All these years,
you've looked down on me.

20:27.902 --> 20:30.904
Now it turns out
I'm actually taller than you.

20:30.971 --> 20:32.605
Ow.

20:32.673 --> 20:35.008
Let's go, little footy.

20:35.076 --> 20:36.509
[Laughs]

20:36.577 --> 20:38.344
Boy, I had big plans for him!

20:38.412 --> 20:40.246
Thanks for nothing... again.

20:40.314 --> 20:42.148
Anytime, pop.

20:46.887 --> 20:49.022
Still a couple of hours
before closing.

20:49.090 --> 20:51.024
Who's up for tossing
some alms at the poor?

20:51.092 --> 20:52.092
I'm buying.

20:52.159 --> 20:55.195
- Arrgh, like,
peg-leg shaggy could go

20:55.262 --> 20:57.864
for another round
of clam cotton candy.

20:57.932 --> 21:00.433
What say ye, dogbeard?

21:00.501 --> 21:04.671
- I say Scooby-Dooby-arrgh!

21:09.110 --> 21:11.611
I so sympathize
with what you're feeling,

21:11.679 --> 21:13.613
but seriously,
trust your heart.

21:13.681 --> 21:15.448
I will. Good luck.

21:15.516 --> 21:17.383
To both of us.
Fred Jones,

21:17.451 --> 21:20.186
don't you dare throw
anything at the poor without me.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.422
[Grunts]

21:22.490 --> 21:24.557
Hey, dude. Watch it.

21:25.793 --> 21:27.694
Huh?

21:28.729 --> 21:31.264
Jerkweed,
you dropped something.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.141
[Gasps]

21:44.845 --> 21:46.346
"Don't give up.

21:46.413 --> 21:48.515
This has all happened before."

21:48.582 --> 21:51.084
What has happened before?
