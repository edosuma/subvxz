WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.923
‐ Yao mentioned that you've been
getting threats.

00:05.923 --> 00:06.924
Is that another one?

00:07.841 --> 00:10.761
‐ Get yourself a vibrator
and let off some steam.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.098
‐ Picture your son Zach.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.769
‐ You're Smiley Hogburn, right?
‐ You're right.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.146
That's Smiley Hogburn!
What happened, man?

00:21.146 --> 00:24.191
‐ I won the lottery. $22 million.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.442
Didn't plan on telling you all that.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.862
‐ It's Ari.
They put them into an induced coma.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.614
FRANCES: Do you mind not saying
anything to the others

00:30.614 --> 00:32.824
about my little internet scam‐dom thing?

00:35.744 --> 00:37.162
‐ You did this?

00:38.664 --> 00:40.624
‐ Something's up with Mom, Dad.

00:40.624 --> 00:41.959
‐ She's turning a corner.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.671
‐ Have you been medicating us?

01:01.937 --> 01:07.526
‐ ♪ You've got
This strange effect on me ♪

02:05.417 --> 02:07.419
MASHA: I'm driving out
of the city right now.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.338
I wake up at the beach house.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.591
5:00 am, I want this in my inbox,

02:12.591 --> 02:15.802
so show me that you have a future, Todd.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.732
Hey, baby.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.026
I'll be there. Couple hours.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.364
Pour me a martini,
I'm gonna fuck your lights out.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.827
HEATHER [echoing]:
Have you been medicating us?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.671
HEATHER: Did you not hear my question?

02:52.214 --> 02:54.216
I would appreciate a response.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.636
I‐‐ I've been feeling unlike myself

02:57.636 --> 02:59.179
for the better part of today.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.598
Carmel says she isn't herself.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.644
And my husband is definitely not himself.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.106
So I ask you again.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.067
Are you drugging us?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.909
‐ It's called microdosing,
and it's perfectly safe.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.369
[all murmur in disbelief]
‐ My God!

03:22.369 --> 03:23.745
FRANCES: Shit!
TONY: Microdosing?

03:23.745 --> 03:25.247
What are you microdosing us with?

03:25.247 --> 03:26.540
‐ Psilocybin.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.959
‐ Magic mushrooms.
‐ Oh, my God.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.961
‐ You're giving us illegal drugs.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.921
MASHA: This is all part
of a very well‐planned,

03:32.921 --> 03:35.507
well‐executed protocol
that we've been working on here

03:35.507 --> 03:37.050
at Tranquillum for a long time.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.594
TONY: That's not the fucking point, okay?

03:38.594 --> 03:40.804
The point is,
you can't give illegal drugs out

03:40.804 --> 03:42.264
to people without consent.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.224
‐ But you arrived here on drugs, Tony.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.685
You're still on drugs,
you're just not on oxycontin,

03:46.685 --> 03:49.521
you're on‐‐ you're on psilocybin.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.024
We've been swapping it out
for two days now.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.570
‐ I was feeling‐‐

03:56.570 --> 03:58.280
I was feeling oxy withdrawals
this morning.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.866
‐ Mm‐hmm. Some, but less.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.784
And how do you feel... right now?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.369
Because you're not on oxy.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.873
‐ That doesn't make it right.
You can't just lie to us.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.626
‐ We haven't been dosing you or Ben.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.588
‐ But the rest of us, yes, right?

04:15.672 --> 04:18.634
God, you got some balls
shaming me about some wine

04:18.634 --> 04:20.052
and a couple of Kit Kats.

04:20.052 --> 04:23.013
All the while, you're dosing us
with psychedelics?

04:23.013 --> 04:25.224
I mean, look, I'm no angel, you know,

04:25.224 --> 04:28.894
I had a few "cocaine nights"
in the '90s, but who didn't?

04:28.894 --> 04:31.230
‐ I didn't!
‐ I believe that.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.899
‐ You know, you could go to jail for this.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.567
‐ I could, but I'm not going to,

04:35.567 --> 04:37.569
because you're gonna be thanking me.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.780
We live in unprecedented times.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.449
‐ Wow, you're going with that old

04:42.449 --> 04:45.077
"unprecedented times" defense?

04:45.077 --> 04:48.330
‐ Okay. Um, I gotta say. Girl, you‐‐

04:48.330 --> 04:50.749
you're a real kick in the pants,
I didn't see it coming.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.502
I'm gonna go to my car
and get the bottle of Tito's

04:53.502 --> 04:54.878
that I hid in my trunk.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.755
MASHA: Mm‐hmm.
FRANCES: And the best part,

04:56.755 --> 04:58.757
you're not gonna say anything about it.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.510
MASHA: Mm‐hmm.
‐ Not a word, right?

05:01.510 --> 05:04.346
What the fuck would she say? Nothin'.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.473
TONY: This is not good.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.559
Some of us came here with drug histories

05:08.559 --> 05:10.143
and genetic predispositions‐‐

05:10.143 --> 05:12.354
‐ We did your blood work
when you checked in,

05:12.354 --> 05:13.772
we know your medical history.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.524
‐ I don't care, Yao!

05:15.524 --> 05:17.693
You can't just keep a secret
like that from us!

05:17.693 --> 05:20.028
‐ But we all have secrets, Tony.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.115
None of us are exactly
how we appear, are we?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.118
You wanna come out with yours?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.082
Lars?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.209
Carmel?

05:35.878 --> 05:38.922
For all I know,
somebody here could be a killer.

05:38.922 --> 05:42.634
Has anybody here ever killed anyone?

05:44.261 --> 05:45.470
No?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.514
Good.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.849
This is good.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.601
This is a load off.

05:52.561 --> 05:56.315
Mmm. So you came here as desperate people.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.108
You are free to go.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.484
Or stay.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.652
It's your call.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.530
And if you choose to stay
and not be dosed,

06:03.530 --> 06:04.865
that's your call, too.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.783
‐ Why didn't you let it be
our call to begin with?

06:06.783 --> 06:08.994
‐ Because you would've
declined out of fear,

06:08.994 --> 06:10.579
but there's nothing to fear...

06:11.163 --> 06:14.374
because this, this protocol,

06:15.417 --> 06:18.754
cures addiction,
it can treat mental illness,

06:18.754 --> 06:23.091
it can treat PTSD,
schizophrenia, dementia.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.677
It can make you eat better,
sleep better, fuck better.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.222
And it has the capacity
to change the world.

06:28.222 --> 06:31.016
‐ And it can make you
gobs and gobs of money

06:31.016 --> 06:32.309
in the process.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.687
MASHA: Maybe that can be your story, Lars.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.775
Did anybody know that Lars here

06:39.775 --> 06:42.194
is an investigative journalist?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.405
‐ Yeah, I knew that.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.575
‐ No, you didn't.
‐ Okay.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.912
‐ And yet, you did,
and you didn't say anything.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.082
‐ Of course not, because
I welcome your exposé, Lars.

06:55.082 --> 06:58.544
Write the story, please,
because once this gets out,

06:58.544 --> 07:00.212
once it gets out in the world,

07:00.212 --> 07:03.215
oh, it's gonna change everything.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.009
And, yes, yes,

07:06.009 --> 07:08.846
it may make me gobs and gobs of money,

07:08.846 --> 07:10.639
but it may win you a Pulitzer.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.894
‐ Exactly how crazy are you?

07:17.229 --> 07:19.857
‐ [inhales]
Just the right amount.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.911
‐ Why isn't she drugging us?

07:34.288 --> 07:37.708
‐ Maybe she realized we're not
as fucked up as the rest of 'em.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.670
‐ Yeah, but we're paying
customers, you know?

07:43.589 --> 07:44.840
‐ Mmm.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.884
‐ Aren't you even curious,
like a little bit?

07:47.759 --> 07:49.261
She said it would open our minds up.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.638
‐ My mind's open enough.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.224
I saw what drugs did to my sister.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.020
‐ She wasn't on psychedelics.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.941
You know, some drugs...

08:04.610 --> 08:06.403
are, are good, you know.

08:06.403 --> 08:11.366
Like, in the right environment,
they can really help‐‐ help people.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.125
‐ Just trying to think.
Did I break the law today?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.586
Psilocybin, cocaine,

08:23.086 --> 08:24.963
oxycontin, it's like the‐‐

08:26.006 --> 08:28.342
like the Betty Ford clinic in reverse.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.968
This woman's playing with fire.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.054
I don't wanna seem ungrateful
for the discount,

08:32.054 --> 08:33.889
but no thank you. Right?

08:33.889 --> 08:34.932
HEATHER: Mmm.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.018
Oh, these sheets feel so good.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.480
‐ What?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.857
‐ They're really cool on my skin.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.612
‐ Hey, hey...

08:49.738 --> 08:51.114
are you okay?

08:51.114 --> 08:52.741
‐ I'm not sick.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.082
‐ So, uh, how do you feel?
‐ Good.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.627
Actually, really good.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.420
‐ Hmm...

09:06.588 --> 09:08.882
So, you wanna stay? Hmm?

09:10.968 --> 09:13.095
‐ I just‐‐ I just‐‐

09:13.095 --> 09:14.847
I just I wanna feel your skin.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.807
NAPOLEON: Really?
HEATHER: Yeah.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.600
NAPOLEON: Oh, okay.
HEATHER: Mmm.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.769
NAPOLEON: Oh, man. [grunts]

09:20.769 --> 09:22.771
‐ [laughs] God...
‐ Hey.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.064
‐ Hi.

09:40.831 --> 09:41.999
MASHA: Yao...

09:56.513 --> 09:57.806
That was them.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.684
Whoever is threatening me.

10:02.144 --> 10:05.063
‐ [sighs] How do you know?

10:05.063 --> 10:06.648
‐ I just do.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.112
And I feel like they're here
at Tranquillum.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.158
Like they're watching us.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.621
‐ Who's watching us?
MASHA: I don't know.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.414
Maybe I brought this into our life,

10:22.414 --> 10:24.041
this person, this darkness.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.376
Maybe I brought it in for a reason.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.253
‐ Are you saying it's one of the guests?

10:28.253 --> 10:29.922
‐ I can't rule it out.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.052
Maybe it's you.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.681
‐ [chuckles]
Never.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.810
But, you know, you telling
that they're being dosed,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.563
I think it's a huge risk and I‐‐
‐ I didn't tell them everything.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.982
YAO: You told them enough.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.527
All it takes is for one of them,
one, to go to the police‐‐

10:51.527 --> 10:53.070
MASHA: Dozens of wellness institutes

10:53.070 --> 10:54.905
are doing this, you know that.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.658
‐ With consent.
‐ Yes, and we have it.

10:57.658 --> 10:58.951
I told them.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.619
They chose to stay.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.496
It's constructive consent.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.649
‐ Where did you go?

11:31.942 --> 11:33.360
‐ Went out for a walk.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.654
‐ You run into Masha?

11:42.536 --> 11:43.745
How is she?

11:44.746 --> 11:47.749
‐ She's actually a bit shaken up...

11:48.876 --> 11:52.212
between the goat and...

11:53.130 --> 11:54.381
DELILAH: The goat and what?

11:55.757 --> 11:56.800
‐ And the threats.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.261
‐ Huh.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.724
‐ They wouldn't be coming
from you, would they?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.267
‐ Why would I wanna threaten Masha?

12:05.267 --> 12:06.977
She's the fucking greatest.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.355
I don't have to tell you that, do I?

12:10.355 --> 12:12.566
‐ [sighs] All right. Okay. Um...

12:12.566 --> 12:13.734
Just relax.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.819
‐ You can sleep on the couch tonight.

12:42.221 --> 12:44.598
HEATHER: Hey.
‐ Oh, hey.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.399
‐ I didn't hear you get up.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.109
NAPOLEON:
Yeah. Well, you know...

12:56.735 --> 12:59.238
[inhales deeply]
I slept without my CPAP

12:59.238 --> 13:01.573
for the first time in six years
last night.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.534
I didn't even know that was possible.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.703
‐ That's wonderful.
‐ Yeah.

13:09.331 --> 13:12.292
[exhales heavily] Interesting evening.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.544
‐ Sure was.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.757
‐ I came a little outside myself.

13:18.757 --> 13:19.758
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.302
It was nice.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.269
‐ You emerged a little yourself...

13:32.479 --> 13:34.773
saying grace.
‐ Hmm...

13:34.773 --> 13:36.275
It was the drugs.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.326
‐ Honey.
‐ What?

13:49.705 --> 13:51.790
‐ There was nothing you could've done.

15:00.526 --> 15:02.945
‐ Hey, hi. Um...

15:02.945 --> 15:05.072
Are there drugs in here?
Because I want them.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.784
‐ Masha's currently evaluating
your protocol.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.703
BEN: So is that a no?
‐ Can I, uh...

15:11.703 --> 15:13.956
Can I say something for the record?

15:15.332 --> 15:18.293
I have zero tolerance for drugs.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.711
I'm a high‐school teacher,

15:19.711 --> 15:22.798
I've seen the ravages,
I can tell you. But, uh...

15:24.716 --> 15:26.093
I'm open to this.

15:27.553 --> 15:30.222
Uh, last night, I, uh...

15:31.223 --> 15:35.519
I'm‐‐ I'm‐‐ I'm‐‐ I'm not at all
happy about slaughtering a goat,

15:35.519 --> 15:37.229
don't get me wrong, but, um,

15:39.022 --> 15:42.234
for the last three years,
I've been feeling...

15:43.569 --> 15:47.322
emotionally constipated
in a way, and‐‐ and last night,

15:47.322 --> 15:50.242
I‐‐ I came uncorked a little.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.538
So, whatever this is,

15:55.622 --> 15:58.959
count the Marconi adults in.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.086
FRANCES:
Here's to the new Timothy Leary.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.589
DELILAH: All right.
Let's go through today's schedule.

16:03.589 --> 16:07.176
Carmel, you have your day
with Masha, your one‐on‐one.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.887
‐ [exhales heavily] Okay.

16:09.887 --> 16:12.139
DELILAH: For everyone else,
Glory will be leading

16:12.139 --> 16:14.600
the temazcal for anyone who thinks...

16:19.313 --> 16:22.149
TONY: Hi.
‐ [gasps] Oh...

16:24.067 --> 16:25.527
‐ Wow.
FRANCES: Yeah.

16:25.527 --> 16:28.405
‐ You‐‐ you okay?
‐ Verdict's still out.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.117
Not exactly sure how I thought
I was gonna teach Masha a lesson

16:32.117 --> 16:34.786
by drinking
most of my trunk Tito's, but...

16:34.786 --> 16:37.247
In the heat of the moment,
it seemed like a fine idea.

16:37.956 --> 16:41.210
‐ Hey. So, you're okay with this, right?

16:41.210 --> 16:43.170
This‐‐ this drugging?
[Frances sighs]

16:43.170 --> 16:46.131
‐ I certainly don't agree
with the lack of consent.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.759
But, I mean, most of us came here

16:48.759 --> 16:50.552
searching for desperate measures.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.720
And I mean, look at you.

16:53.222 --> 16:55.349
‐ What me? Me what? What about me?

16:56.058 --> 16:57.226
‐ Oh, boy.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.271
When you arrived, you were...

17:02.439 --> 17:04.149
kind of a complete jackass.

17:04.149 --> 17:05.275
No offense.
‐ Oh.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.277
FRANCES: And I have
witnessed you becoming...

17:07.945 --> 17:10.614
less complete in that area.

17:10.614 --> 17:13.116
‐ Hmm.
FRANCES: So my vote is,

17:14.076 --> 17:16.286
give this thing a shot, you know? And...

17:17.079 --> 17:18.205
open up a new door.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.253
‐ Some doors are meant to stay closed.

17:24.253 --> 17:25.420
You know what I mean?

17:27.631 --> 17:29.633
‐ Yeah, it could be a real shitshow.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.385
What the hell do I know, right?

17:35.973 --> 17:37.808
MASHA: Carmel.
CARMEL: Hello.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.184
MASHA: Please, sit.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.644
How's everybody doing today?

17:40.644 --> 17:43.647
CARMEL: Mmm.
Kind of a brave new world, I guess.

17:43.647 --> 17:47.025
You know, what, with all
the mushrooms and smoothies.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.779
MASHA: Indeed.
‐ Yeah.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.365
‐ And you personally?

17:53.365 --> 17:55.367
‐ Oh, good, good.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.412
‐ Good.
‐ Yeah.

17:58.412 --> 18:01.081
‐ I hear you wanna punch
Jessica in the face.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.002
Hmm?

18:05.002 --> 18:07.379
‐ Ah, well, figuratively I do.

18:07.379 --> 18:08.881
Not for real, I would...

18:09.715 --> 18:12.009
I would never really do that. [laughs]

18:12.009 --> 18:13.760
‐ You get violent?

18:13.760 --> 18:16.847
‐ Although I can get violent,
I'm not violent. There's a...

18:17.598 --> 18:19.808
big difference.
You know, it's not my being.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.602
It's more like, um...

18:23.604 --> 18:27.316
like an offshoot
outlier version of‐‐ of...

18:28.317 --> 18:30.152
of myself, I guess.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.947
My husband, he left me.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.450
Left me for...

18:37.951 --> 18:39.453
a younger, prettier thing.

18:40.662 --> 18:41.997
My kids love her.

18:41.997 --> 18:44.499
You know, they call her by her first name.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.251
Lillian.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.797
And she's a sweet woman with a sweet name.

18:54.593 --> 18:57.471
They're in Italy right now,
vacationing together.

19:00.432 --> 19:03.560
[sighs] She's sweet, but...

19:04.686 --> 19:08.023
I get urges, you know.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.109
‐ "Pow, right in the face."

19:11.109 --> 19:13.987
‐ Yup. [chuckles] You know.

19:13.987 --> 19:14.947
Yeah.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.951
You know, he...

19:22.079 --> 19:24.081
He had other affairs before her.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.461
[sighs] Sometimes,
even in the best marriages,

19:29.461 --> 19:31.088
people pretend.

19:31.088 --> 19:33.632
It takes a little denial on both sides.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.801
In the end, he...

19:38.846 --> 19:40.264
He couldn't pretend.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.686
Can I show you something?

19:45.686 --> 19:46.937
MASHA: Yes.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.776
‐ Can you see that?
MASHA: Oh.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.071
‐ It's a little scar.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.365
He bit me.

20:00.367 --> 20:04.162
But it was an act of passion,
back when he just‐‐

20:04.162 --> 20:06.498
he couldn't get enough of me.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.710
And I fondle this scar...

20:10.711 --> 20:12.754
almost every night...

20:14.214 --> 20:15.966
because it reminds me of...

20:18.010 --> 20:20.095
what we used to have.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.767
‐ Will you write down
some of the bad things?

20:25.767 --> 20:29.229
That he said to you? Can you do that?

20:29.229 --> 20:31.857
‐ There are a lot of them.
[chuckles nervously]

20:46.413 --> 20:47.998
GLORY:
Tradition says we should chant

20:47.998 --> 20:49.791
to distract ourselves from the heat.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.753
But I think a good old‐fashioned
scream works better.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.678
GLORY: There you go.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.515
LARS: Okay.
[Zoe laughs]

21:04.515 --> 21:06.350
Thanks, Glory.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.942
‐ I did know, by the way. [panting]

21:14.942 --> 21:16.860
Maybe not the reporter part,
but definitely

21:16.860 --> 21:18.153
that you weren't a real guest.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.906
‐ I am a real guest.
[Zoe pants]

21:20.906 --> 21:24.076
I'm just a reporter also.
[Zoe chuckles]

21:24.076 --> 21:27.329
And Masha did select me, remember? So...

21:28.580 --> 21:31.458
it must mean I'm as messed up
as the rest of you.

21:32.251 --> 21:33.961
At least in her mind.

21:33.961 --> 21:36.755
‐ [pants] What about your mind?

21:36.755 --> 21:39.299
‐ Oh. Well...

21:39.299 --> 21:44.221
I'm going through this break‐up
with Ray, you know.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.306
Who doesn't get messed up over that?

21:47.432 --> 21:51.436
And I'm gay, so according
to my Catholic upbringing...

21:54.314 --> 21:56.191
‐ Yeah! [laughs]

21:56.650 --> 21:58.694
Wait, did you know she was doing all this?

21:58.694 --> 21:59.862
Is that why you're here?

22:00.487 --> 22:03.031
‐ [exhales]
I'd heard the rumors.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.034
You know, this could be
really good for you.

22:06.827 --> 22:08.787
I mean, anxiety, depression.

22:08.787 --> 22:11.748
I mean, that's where psychedelics
show phenomenal promise.

22:11.748 --> 22:13.625
‐ I'm not depressed.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.043
LARS: Of course you're depressed,

22:15.043 --> 22:16.503
your brother killed himself.

22:17.004 --> 22:18.881
If you weren't depressed, you'd be...

22:18.881 --> 22:20.841
having some kind of psychosis,
and I'm sure

22:20.841 --> 22:22.342
she'd be dosing you for that.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.762
And, uh, you're smiling.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.931
Depressed people smile, FYI.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.349
‐ I'm smiling 'cause you're funny.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.185
LARS:
Tomorrow's your 21st birthday.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.396
It's his 21st birthday.
‐ We weren't close.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.981
LARS: Oh, I don't believe that.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.401
‐ A lot of siblings aren't close.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.819
‐ Well, I believe that.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.821
I just‐‐ I just don't believe you

22:42.821 --> 22:44.531
when you say that you and Zach weren't.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.533
‐ What, do you have some sort
of crystal ball or something?

22:48.744 --> 22:51.038
‐ I just can't imagine.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.631
It's a good place to cry, you know.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.718
We can mistake the tears for sweat.

23:06.261 --> 23:08.055
‐ So what's your spin gonna be?

23:08.931 --> 23:11.600
You plan to take this place down?

23:14.686 --> 23:15.938
Honestly?

23:17.564 --> 23:19.191
I don't know yet.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.493
DELILAH: Meet Mr. Kendo.

23:29.493 --> 23:33.372
Ordinarily, we would have
you project your self‐doubts,

23:33.372 --> 23:37.417
your insecurities,
your demons onto the dummy

23:37.417 --> 23:39.253
and then attack away.

23:39.253 --> 23:41.672
‐ So much self‐loathing, so little time.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.843
‐ It seems that many of us

23:45.843 --> 23:49.304
have actually been damaged
by other people.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.268
So...

23:54.268 --> 23:56.353
we're gonna try something different.

23:56.353 --> 23:57.980
Now, who would like to begin?

23:59.523 --> 24:01.275
MASHA: Frances.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.778
DELILAH: Frances, great.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.365
You can come get the sword.

24:08.365 --> 24:10.158
‐ That's okay. I don't need the sword.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.577
‐ Come on.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.203
Be brave.
NAPOLEON: Oh, come on.

24:13.203 --> 24:15.205
Someone's gotta be first. Come on.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.460
FRANCES: Thank you.
DELILAH: Mm‐hmm.

24:20.460 --> 24:25.048
So, Mr. Kendo is gonna take on
a few different forms today,

24:25.048 --> 24:28.010
but let's start with the universal he.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.762
Him by whom we are judged.

24:31.054 --> 24:34.558
Dismissed. Used. Abused. Abandoned.

24:34.558 --> 24:35.601
FRANCES: Wow.

24:35.601 --> 24:38.437
I have to admit that's
a terrible Tinder profile.

24:39.563 --> 24:41.440
‐ Anyone specific come to mind?

24:42.566 --> 24:44.151
‐ Not really, you know.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.569
It's hard to narrow it down.

24:46.153 --> 24:47.988
So many schmucks to choose from.

24:47.988 --> 24:50.616
‐ No jokes, Frances.
Come on. Stay in the pain.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.536
PAUL: Come on, Frances.

24:55.579 --> 24:56.955
Pick somebody.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.916
How about me? I'm here.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.294
[echoing]:
Ari has been in a car accident.

25:02.294 --> 25:03.879
FRANCES:
How I can I help? What can I do?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.715
PAUL: I'm sorry, but I‐‐
I would never do this,

25:06.715 --> 25:09.843
but I could really use
a little help, financially.

25:10.761 --> 25:12.095
‐ I don't wanna see you.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.226
I don't wanna‐‐ I don't want him here.

25:17.851 --> 25:20.604
‐ Why not?
‐ 'Cause he hurt‐‐

25:21.480 --> 25:22.940
he really hurt me.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.149
MASHA: How?

25:24.650 --> 25:25.734
Hmm?

25:26.568 --> 25:27.903
Be specific.

25:32.074 --> 25:35.202
‐ Did you know I went
and checked out schools for Ari?

25:36.078 --> 25:37.412
Did you know all that?

25:37.412 --> 25:39.456
I went to PTA meetings

25:39.456 --> 25:41.875
and I‐I sat with all those parents.

25:41.875 --> 25:42.751
I...

25:44.127 --> 25:45.879
I talked about my family.

25:48.006 --> 25:50.300
I wanted it all set up when you arrived,

25:50.300 --> 25:51.426
but you never...

25:52.469 --> 25:55.556
never arrived,
and you're never gonna arrive.

25:55.556 --> 25:57.808
You‐‐ you said we'd raise Ari together.

25:57.808 --> 26:00.185
You kept saying to me
over and over I was gonna‐‐

26:03.522 --> 26:06.483
I was gonna‐‐ gonna be a mom.

26:08.944 --> 26:12.197
And you took that from me
and I can't get it back.

26:13.115 --> 26:14.533
You took my money.

26:14.533 --> 26:16.285
You took my confidence.

26:16.285 --> 26:17.786
Fuck you for lying.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.746
And fuck you for being garbage.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.252
Fuck you for not loving me.

26:37.055 --> 26:38.140
‐ Come on.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.879
MASHA: Okay. Who's next, huh?

27:08.879 --> 27:10.172
Carmel?

27:11.840 --> 27:14.051
‐ No, I‐‐ I can't top that.

27:14.051 --> 27:15.761
‐ Yes, I think you're ready.

27:15.761 --> 27:16.929
Come on, take the sword.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.484
Go ahead.

27:39.117 --> 27:41.036
Come on. No, no.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.955
You can do better than that.

27:48.043 --> 27:50.587
‐ "Really? Is that what you're gonna wear?

27:55.092 --> 27:57.094
"Do any of your clothes fit?

28:01.515 --> 28:03.350
"Maybe I'd be more attracted to you

28:03.350 --> 28:05.143
"if you made more of an effort.

28:06.562 --> 28:08.689
We met at work. You don't know her."

28:10.399 --> 28:12.276
‐ "I'm not in love with you.

28:12.276 --> 28:14.903
"I'm not, I'm in love with her.

28:14.903 --> 28:17.906
"You should be happy for me.
Why can't you be happy for me?

28:17.906 --> 28:20.868
"And the kids love her.
They wanna live with us.

28:20.868 --> 28:23.829
"She's a better mother than you.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.373
You've let yourself go."

28:27.416 --> 28:28.625
Yeah!

28:28.625 --> 28:31.461
[screams]
Go.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.713
Yes.

28:33.714 --> 28:35.591
[Carmel screams]
Kill him.

28:35.591 --> 28:37.217
Hit him! Hurt him!

28:45.601 --> 28:47.811
Well done.
[Carmel exhales]

28:47.811 --> 28:49.771
‐ This place is fucked.

28:57.821 --> 29:00.949
‐ Hey, I think we should go, check out.

29:00.949 --> 29:03.035
‐ What? Why?
NAPOLEON: I, uh‐‐

29:03.035 --> 29:05.704
I don't deny there's something
therapeutic about it all,

29:05.704 --> 29:08.290
but it's feeling a little,
uh, volatile now, dangerous.

29:08.290 --> 29:09.791
[Heather scoffs]
I mean,

29:09.791 --> 29:11.543
that frightened me in there.

29:12.085 --> 29:13.545
Didn't it scare you?

29:14.379 --> 29:15.923
‐ A little.
‐ A little?

29:15.923 --> 29:17.716
Heather. She's drugging us.

29:17.716 --> 29:20.135
Getting people to act out in violence now.

29:20.135 --> 29:22.888
‐ I know. But...
‐ But? But what? Seriously?

29:22.888 --> 29:27.768
‐ Leo, for three years,
we've been so disconnected.

29:27.768 --> 29:29.353
Something's changing.

29:30.354 --> 29:33.440
We both feel it, you said so yourself.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.859
‐ You said we came here for an escape.

29:35.859 --> 29:38.195
And tomorrow is Zoe's birthday,
for God's sake.

29:38.195 --> 29:40.113
It should be a happy time.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.782
‐ It's not gonna be a happy time.

29:41.782 --> 29:43.200
‐ What?

29:43.200 --> 29:46.078
‐ Their 21st birthday.
‐ Well‐‐

29:46.078 --> 29:47.579
HEATHER: Hey.
ZOE: Hi.

29:47.579 --> 29:49.581
NAPOLEON: Hey, kiddo!
‐ What's going on?

29:49.581 --> 29:51.542
‐ We're just discussing,

29:51.542 --> 29:52.918
you know, what... [chuckles]

29:52.918 --> 29:54.336
It's getting a little crazy here

29:54.336 --> 29:55.754
and, uh, tomorrow is your birthday.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.214
We thought maybe we'd be better‐‐

29:57.214 --> 29:58.549
‐ No, I wanna be here.

29:59.591 --> 30:00.717
Yeah.

30:02.094 --> 30:05.138
NAPOLEON:
You, uh‐‐ you wanna be here?

30:05.138 --> 30:06.473
‐ She wants to be here.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.308
‐ Are you sure?
ZOE: Yeah.

30:38.255 --> 30:40.048
JESSICA:
[clears throat] Sorry.

30:40.048 --> 30:41.675
[chuckles] Hi.

30:41.675 --> 30:42.634
Sorry.

30:43.552 --> 30:46.805
Are you okay?
‐ Uh, yes, I...

30:46.805 --> 30:49.141
I love the trees out here.

30:49.141 --> 30:51.476
If you listen,
you can hear them breathing.

30:51.476 --> 30:52.769
‐ [chuckles] That's cool.

30:53.395 --> 30:56.523
Hey, uh, did you get a chance
to connect with Masha

30:56.523 --> 30:59.026
about the smoothie sitch?

30:59.026 --> 31:01.737
‐ Yes. Uh, she wants to give
you a different formula.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.405
‐ Okay.
‐ The research shows

31:03.405 --> 31:05.782
that for couples, relationship healing,

31:05.782 --> 31:07.784
MDMA is profoundly beneficial.

31:07.784 --> 31:08.994
‐ Molly.

31:09.578 --> 31:10.954
What...

31:10.954 --> 31:12.706
So, is that something that could happen?

31:13.665 --> 31:15.000
Like...

31:15.000 --> 31:16.877
Like, when...
‐ Uh, now‐‐

31:16.877 --> 31:18.420
‐ Right now?
‐ Maybe. Now.

31:18.420 --> 31:20.255
‐ [stammers] Great.
‐ Could be now.

31:20.255 --> 31:22.674
‐ Yeah, let's do it now.
‐ Okay, sure.

31:22.674 --> 31:24.468
‐ [laughs] That's awesome.

31:24.468 --> 31:27.095
‐ Yeah. Um, I'll get Glory
to meet you in the refectory.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.680
JESSICA: Ah. I'm sorry.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.890
I don't...

31:30.849 --> 31:32.476
It's just fucking...

31:32.935 --> 31:35.854
relationships, am I right? [chuckles]

31:35.854 --> 31:37.272
They're so...

31:37.272 --> 31:39.024
‐ Crazy. Insane.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.068
Brutal.

31:42.736 --> 31:43.612
‐ Yeah.

31:44.613 --> 31:45.572
‐ Yeah.

31:52.788 --> 31:54.373
MAN: Hey, Smiley.

31:58.752 --> 31:59.920
Hey, Smiley.

32:01.713 --> 32:02.881
Hey.

32:03.590 --> 32:04.967
Why don't you come over
and let us buy you a beer?

32:04.967 --> 32:06.927
‐ Hey, look, I get that all the time, pal.

32:06.927 --> 32:08.262
I'm not the guy.
‐ Come on.

32:09.096 --> 32:10.931
You can't be bothered to talk to me,

32:10.931 --> 32:12.933
that what you trying to say?
‐ I'm having a drink, okay?

32:12.933 --> 32:14.184
I'm having a rough few days.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.144
That's why I'm at the bar by myself.

32:16.144 --> 32:17.896
‐ You know, you should be grateful.

32:17.896 --> 32:20.232
The only reason I remember you at all

32:20.232 --> 32:21.942
is because your story is so pathetic.

32:21.942 --> 32:24.319
‐ Uh‐hmm. Yeah.
‐ Yeah, you overrated gimp.

32:24.319 --> 32:25.487
‐ Motherfucker.

32:44.423 --> 32:46.091
FRANCES: Hey, there you are.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.260
Are you okay?

32:50.512 --> 32:52.681
Are you‐‐ Tony, are you okay?

32:54.391 --> 32:56.101
‐ She's crazy, Frances.

32:58.270 --> 32:59.688
She's drugging us.

32:59.688 --> 33:01.815
She's giving us swords and shit.

33:01.815 --> 33:03.483
‐ What is going on?
‐ Nothing.

33:07.404 --> 33:09.448
‐ You know, I hate to point out
the obvious,

33:09.448 --> 33:11.575
but, you know, you did try
to kill me with a grape

33:11.575 --> 33:13.619
and almost drowned me with a cannonball.

33:13.619 --> 33:17.122
We have shared history here.
Okay, what‐‐ hey. Hey.

33:18.081 --> 33:20.250
I'm just saying you can talk to me.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.127
‐ It's nothing.
It's just the violence here, okay?

33:22.127 --> 33:24.505
It... I'm not comfortable with it.

33:25.506 --> 33:26.965
She's fucking with me.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.178
Asking if any of us are
capable of killing somebody.

33:31.178 --> 33:32.387
She knows.

33:33.180 --> 33:34.932
‐ Knows what That you're a killer?

33:37.935 --> 33:39.436
‐ I was just sitting in a bar.

33:40.187 --> 33:42.272
A year after I left the game.

33:42.940 --> 33:44.399
This drunk guy just...

33:45.067 --> 33:46.693
just comes up and starts fucking with me,

33:46.693 --> 33:48.362
you know, that's the thing.

33:48.362 --> 33:50.197
Drunk guys fucking with athletes in bars.

33:50.197 --> 33:52.449
They only wanna impress
their drunk buddies.

33:53.158 --> 33:54.618
We fought.

33:54.618 --> 33:57.704
He went down and he never got up.

33:58.914 --> 34:00.832
They took him to the hospital.

34:00.832 --> 34:02.376
Bleeding in the brain

34:02.376 --> 34:04.086
from hitting his head on the ground.

34:08.465 --> 34:10.300
Yeah, he died six days later.

34:14.096 --> 34:16.473
FRANCES:
I don't know what to say. Um...

34:17.683 --> 34:20.060
Did‐‐ did you get in trouble or did you‐‐

34:20.060 --> 34:21.812
I mean, do you get charged for that?

34:21.812 --> 34:24.690
‐ No, the witnesses there, they saw
that I didn't start it, you know.

34:25.607 --> 34:26.859
I didn't mean to.

34:26.859 --> 34:28.777
‐ I don't follow‐‐ I don't know what‐‐

34:28.777 --> 34:30.279
I don't follow sports or‐‐

34:30.279 --> 34:31.905
I just‐‐ I didn't know.

34:31.905 --> 34:34.575
TONY: No, they buried it
in the paper the day after.

34:34.575 --> 34:36.702
And then when he died
a week later, they...

34:38.620 --> 34:40.080
they barely mentioned it.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.665
Dribs and drabs, you know, but...

34:44.001 --> 34:47.588
I mean, before social media,
so thank God, huh?

34:50.632 --> 34:52.301
It doesn't matter at all.

34:52.968 --> 34:54.511
I killed him.

35:00.267 --> 35:01.852
He had a mother, Frances.

35:01.852 --> 35:03.270
He had a father, you know.

35:04.521 --> 35:05.647
A wife.

35:07.191 --> 35:08.358
He had a little sister.

35:09.902 --> 35:11.153
I killed him.

35:12.529 --> 35:14.072
I made him dead.

35:17.242 --> 35:19.244
Fuck.
‐ Is that why you're here?

35:19.244 --> 35:21.872
‐ I don't know
why the fuck I'm here, Frances.

35:21.872 --> 35:23.165
I'm an...

35:24.166 --> 35:25.459
I'm a drug addict.

35:27.169 --> 35:28.921
I got two kids that don't talk to me.

35:28.921 --> 35:30.923
I got a career that ended in a blink.

35:30.923 --> 35:32.341
Why am I here?

35:34.843 --> 35:36.345
I got nowhere else to go.

35:38.305 --> 35:39.264
Ah!

35:42.726 --> 35:44.102
‐ Okay.
[Tony grunts]

35:44.102 --> 35:45.062
Okay.

35:46.188 --> 35:47.147
Okay.

36:03.872 --> 36:05.040
‐ This is not good.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.417
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.127
Hi, you.

36:09.127 --> 36:11.296
Happy almost birthday.
‐ Yeah.

36:11.296 --> 36:12.881
If all goes well, I'll be celebrating

36:12.881 --> 36:14.675
by doing drugs with my parents.

36:15.259 --> 36:16.844
What'd you do for yours?

36:16.844 --> 36:19.930
‐ Uh, not that. I can assure you.

36:19.930 --> 36:21.265
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.728
MASHA: They're blossoming.

36:26.728 --> 36:30.315
‐ I know, but level two?
‐ Mm‐hmm. They're ready.

36:30.315 --> 36:33.193
‐ [inhales, sighs]
On the new protocol, Masha,

36:33.193 --> 36:34.736
I don't think so, this is too fast.

36:34.736 --> 36:35.863
‐ Yes, they are.

36:36.530 --> 36:37.781
Listen to me.

36:42.703 --> 36:45.414
‐ I just saw Glory in the kitchen.

36:45.414 --> 36:46.915
She's increasing the dosage.

36:46.915 --> 36:49.084
‐ Mm‐hmm. Per my instructions.

36:49.084 --> 36:51.712
‐ Why am I finding out
about this in this way?

36:55.215 --> 36:57.301
‐ It's minuscule.

36:57.301 --> 36:59.052
‐ Jesus Christ, Masha.

37:02.347 --> 37:04.433
‐ Can we have a moment, please, Yao?

37:06.226 --> 37:07.436
‐ Of course.

37:07.436 --> 37:09.980
MASHA: Delilah, you need to calm down.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.274
‐ Oh, do I?
MASHA: Yes.

37:12.274 --> 37:15.152
‐ Well, you're increasing
the dosage too quickly.

37:15.152 --> 37:16.528
‐ That's what you think.

37:19.239 --> 37:21.241
But I wanna talk about yours.

37:24.828 --> 37:27.998
Yao's told me that you're not
drinking your smoothies.

37:27.998 --> 37:30.918
‐ [laughs] This is not about me.

37:30.918 --> 37:32.628
‐ I'm making it about you.

37:33.962 --> 37:35.797
I put my guests in your care.

37:36.715 --> 37:39.301
It is important that your bipolarity
is under control.

37:39.301 --> 37:41.678
‐ I'm fine.
‐ The protocol.

37:42.346 --> 37:44.139
It's a condition of your employment,

37:44.139 --> 37:45.265
you know that.

37:46.517 --> 37:48.727
‐ Got it. Anything else?

37:49.394 --> 37:51.772
‐ Yes. I think you should
lighten up on Yao.

37:52.481 --> 37:54.399
So he came to my room, big deal.

37:54.858 --> 37:56.443
It's been known to happen, hasn't it?

38:00.197 --> 38:02.699
‐ If you cut me out of important decisions

38:02.699 --> 38:04.451
involving our guests again,

38:05.911 --> 38:07.913
I promise you it will not end well.

38:14.211 --> 38:15.671
‐ Take your medicine.

38:16.922 --> 38:18.173
Please.

38:21.301 --> 38:24.012
Come on, have some fun.

38:27.724 --> 38:29.309
Everybody.

38:30.769 --> 38:34.064
We have another delicious meal
awaiting you.

38:34.064 --> 38:37.192
And I think you all had a splendid day.

38:38.777 --> 38:40.237
Jessica.

38:40.237 --> 38:42.322
‐ It was really, really good. Thank you.

38:44.283 --> 38:47.286
‐ Oh, yes, Lars, very polite
of you to raise your hand.

38:47.286 --> 38:48.662
LARS: I'm just wondering.

38:48.662 --> 38:51.290
Might there be something
in my smoothie this evening?

38:51.290 --> 38:52.666
‐ You'll have to wait and see.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.376
‐ Might there be something in mine?

38:55.711 --> 38:58.338
‐ Zoe, tomorrow is your 21st birthday.

38:58.338 --> 39:01.508
‐ Gotcha.
‐ And a party shall be had.

39:01.508 --> 39:03.051
The Marconis,

39:03.927 --> 39:07.806
we come from a very long,
uh, line of, uh...

39:09.766 --> 39:11.810
FRANCES [echoing]:
[chuckles] You can do it.

39:13.270 --> 39:14.771
‐ Celebrators.
NAPOLEON: Yeah,

39:14.771 --> 39:16.273
celebrators, exactly.

39:16.273 --> 39:19.318
‐ Yes, let's have
a toast to Tranquillum...

39:20.527 --> 39:24.281
to healing and beyond.

39:24.281 --> 39:25.824
‐ I‐‐ I'll drink to that.

39:25.824 --> 39:27.868
‐ To all of you.

39:27.868 --> 39:29.661
‐ To us.
‐ To us.

39:29.661 --> 39:30.913
NAPOLEON: To us.

40:53.245 --> 40:56.290
‐ ♪ I used to be a lunatic ♪
