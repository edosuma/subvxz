00:00.912 --> 00:02.111
Once upon a time,

00:02.113 --> 00:04.547
there was a majestic king,

00:04.941 --> 00:07.124
who lived with his noble brother

00:07.144 --> 00:11.360
in a colorful kingdom where
music and art were celebrated.

00:11.380 --> 00:14.090
The king did not foresee having a child,

00:14.110 --> 00:16.425
but he lived in an enchanted land

00:16.777 --> 00:19.239
where all things were possible.

00:19.259 --> 00:24.079
In time, he was blessed with
a beautiful baby daughter

00:24.099 --> 00:27.603
for whom he wished only
peace and happiness.

00:31.075 --> 00:34.662
Still, the king had demons who pursued him.

00:34.798 --> 00:38.728
There was a ruthless beast who wanted
to take the kingdom for her own.

00:38.748 --> 00:41.532
Armed with a pack of untamed creatures,

00:41.552 --> 00:44.553
she drove the other magical
beings from the land,

00:44.555 --> 00:48.350
and there was a wicked
sorceress with enchanted stones

00:48.370 --> 00:52.361
that weakened the king on every full moon.

00:52.363 --> 00:56.148
Seeing the shadow his
enemies cast upon his home,

00:56.150 --> 00:59.878
the king was driven to send
his beloved princess away,

00:59.898 --> 01:02.071
convincing all who remained

01:02.073 --> 01:04.540
that she was forever lost.

01:07.244 --> 01:11.413
The king, in his sorrow,
turned away from the world.

01:11.587 --> 01:16.215
The castle closed its
doors, and the kingdom fell.

01:16.921 --> 01:19.851
Some say that the only light
that shines in the castle

01:19.871 --> 01:22.424
illuminates the shadow
of the once mighty king

01:22.426 --> 01:25.427
in the room meant for his child,

01:25.429 --> 01:27.646
but as the ruthless beasts took rule

01:27.648 --> 01:30.766
over the falling king's realm,

01:30.891 --> 01:33.563
little did they know
that he and his brother

01:33.583 --> 01:37.272
would not rest until their
enemies were vanquished...

01:39.360 --> 01:42.044
For they believed that one day

01:42.064 --> 01:46.532
they would heal their kingdom
and bring their princess home

01:46.534 --> 01:51.870
so that she might live happily ever after.

01:58.295 --> 02:02.097
Authentic cast-iron columns.

02:02.099 --> 02:04.133
Look at that.

02:04.135 --> 02:05.918
The original bloomery forge

02:05.920 --> 02:07.886
fueled by a charcoal furnace.

02:12.276 --> 02:15.322
The modern elements
blend very nicely indeed.

02:15.342 --> 02:18.981
My foundation has aligned itself with the
city's historical preservation society.

02:18.983 --> 02:21.283
We have a vested interest in...

02:21.285 --> 02:22.589
seeing this building protected.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.078
Place is a dump.

02:24.098 --> 02:27.322
The Guerrera family would
be doing the city a favor.

02:29.674 --> 02:31.076
Well, unfortunately,

02:31.078 --> 02:32.995
under the preservation act of 1966,

02:32.997 --> 02:34.663
we cannot allow the Guerreras to demolish

02:34.665 --> 02:36.498
one of the city's original foundries,

02:36.500 --> 02:38.500
even if it is for something as noble

02:38.502 --> 02:43.181
and distinguished as a casino.

02:43.541 --> 02:45.140
So thank you, gentlemen,

02:45.142 --> 02:47.342
and do give my best to Francesca.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.037
I suppose we shall have to
call this your white period.

03:15.039 --> 03:17.589
I'm missing a crucial color in my palette,

03:17.591 --> 03:19.190
that of my enemy's blood.

03:19.210 --> 03:21.399
Well, I recommend a venetian
red with a dash of rust.

03:21.419 --> 03:22.801
It's been months!

03:22.821 --> 03:24.546
I've adhered to our plan sit...

03:24.548 --> 03:26.997
and do nothing, sell our grief,

03:27.017 --> 03:29.218
and now my child is safely away,

03:29.220 --> 03:31.470
and another full moon is upon us,

03:31.472 --> 03:33.623
another night of pathetic weakness

03:33.643 --> 03:36.558
as the moonlight rings steal my strength.

03:39.146 --> 03:41.230
The inertia is killing me.

03:41.232 --> 03:43.232
I need to act. I... I need...

03:43.234 --> 03:45.400
I need to spill blood.

03:45.402 --> 03:48.237
Well, then you'll be pleased to know

03:48.239 --> 03:50.239
that I've located the last of the 12 rings

03:50.241 --> 03:53.085
forged with your blood.

03:53.544 --> 03:55.542
- Then it's time.
- And none too soon.

03:55.562 --> 03:58.617
I'm concerned about Hayley.

03:59.283 --> 04:02.084
- She looks well enough.
- She looks no better than you, brother.

04:02.086 --> 04:04.603
Now if the two of you would
treat each other as more than just

04:04.623 --> 04:07.840
- passing acquaintances...
- She has you to help her.

04:09.923 --> 04:11.927
Sadly...

04:11.947 --> 04:14.062
like the father of her child,

04:14.064 --> 04:16.765
she prefers to fight her demons alone.

05:42.886 --> 05:44.069
What's the hurry?

05:44.089 --> 05:45.571
I have to get back to campus,

05:45.573 --> 05:46.766
meet my new advisor.

05:46.786 --> 05:48.851
Apparently the one I was
supposed to have dropped dead.

05:48.871 --> 05:51.531
Guy did triathlons yet couldn't
climb a flight of stairs.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.779
Will I see you later?

05:53.781 --> 05:55.750
Marcel, you know the deal.

05:55.770 --> 05:58.367
No strings, no plans.

05:58.369 --> 05:59.952
I know, I know.

06:00.386 --> 06:02.704
Just feeling nostalgic, I guess.

06:04.174 --> 06:06.218
You're not missing anything over there.

06:06.238 --> 06:08.350
That bitch Francesca's got
her werewolves on every corner,

06:08.370 --> 06:10.295
and as usual, the humans
in the known don't care

06:10.297 --> 06:12.764
as long as tourism money
keeps rolling through.

06:12.766 --> 06:15.183
Yeah. Got to say, never thought I'd see

06:15.185 --> 06:17.719
the day the vampires were
kicked out of the quarter.

06:17.721 --> 06:19.554
And I never thought I'd
be sleeping with one,

06:19.556 --> 06:22.858
so I guess life is full of surprises.

06:31.068 --> 06:33.213
How's Klaus?

06:34.038 --> 06:35.434
Nobody knows.

06:35.454 --> 06:37.246
Not even you?

06:37.266 --> 06:39.045
Not even me.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.409
It doesn't make sense.

06:40.411 --> 06:42.327
The wolves attacked him in his home,

06:42.329 --> 06:44.580
took his town, probably killed his kid.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.292
Why hasn't he struck back?

06:47.084 --> 06:49.101
- He's in mourning.
- No, no.

06:49.121 --> 06:51.920
If anyone can mourn and murder
at the same time, it's him.

06:51.922 --> 06:53.588
Something's up.

06:53.590 --> 06:55.173
Just wish I knew what.

06:58.429 --> 07:00.429
I saw Davina.

07:00.431 --> 07:01.647
She's doing well.

07:01.649 --> 07:03.008
She's back in high school.

07:03.028 --> 07:05.934
She told her whole witch coven to shove it.

07:05.936 --> 07:07.936
Good.

07:07.938 --> 07:09.604
Good girl.

07:13.822 --> 07:15.968
Maybe it's better.

07:16.241 --> 07:18.113
Just move forward

07:18.115 --> 07:21.416
instead of holding on to
things we can't change.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.431
Yeah.

07:26.006 --> 07:27.789
Maybe.

07:35.432 --> 07:37.215
Here you go, Davina.

07:37.217 --> 07:39.101
Now sometime, you're gonna
have to give me the lowdown

07:39.103 --> 07:42.764
on why you're so hooked on
ancient Icelandic folk music.

07:42.784 --> 07:45.357
- It's for someone else.
- I sure hope so.

07:45.359 --> 07:46.975
Ha ha ha!

07:58.322 --> 07:59.321
Hey there, cutie.

07:59.323 --> 08:00.906
Don't call me that.

08:00.908 --> 08:04.326
So I heard that you ditched your coven.

08:04.328 --> 08:07.106
That's too bad. That
other harvest girl Cassie,

08:07.126 --> 08:09.631
she has been superhelpful

08:09.633 --> 08:12.884
- to all us wolves.
- She's making you moonlight rings, Oliver.

08:12.886 --> 08:16.050
I wouldn't call that helpful.
I'd call that an alliance.

08:16.336 --> 08:17.672
Well, you can call it whatever you want.

08:17.674 --> 08:21.299
As long as we don't have to turn in the
full moon anymore, it works for me...

08:21.523 --> 08:22.939
But look.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.334
I'd take off if I were you.

08:25.354 --> 08:28.027
Things are about to get
a little ugly in here.

08:28.511 --> 08:30.318
Hey, y'all. Store's closed.

08:31.290 --> 08:33.188
Get out now!

08:33.417 --> 08:35.690
Hey. What are you doing?

08:35.692 --> 08:37.692
It's Joe Dalton, right?

08:37.693 --> 08:40.068
You see, I've been
studying up on this store.

08:40.087 --> 08:44.466
It's be a stable for
the quarter for 90 years.

08:44.468 --> 08:48.767
It was run by you, your daddy,
and then his daddy before him.

08:48.787 --> 08:50.038
That's right.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.185
Yeah. You see, the thing is, Joe,

08:52.205 --> 08:54.459
there just ain't many photos

08:54.461 --> 08:57.382
of anyone in your family

08:57.765 --> 08:59.264
but you.

08:59.266 --> 09:01.383
Oliver, no!

09:01.385 --> 09:04.019
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

09:08.342 --> 09:10.225
Joe, get out of here.

09:15.899 --> 09:17.532
We have a deal, Cassie.

09:17.534 --> 09:20.619
Witches don't get in our way
when it comes to killing vampires

09:20.621 --> 09:21.860
who enter the quarter.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.039
Davina's not in our coven anymore.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.211
The rules don't apply to her.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.706
Well, make them apply.

09:28.096 --> 09:30.039
Get everyone out of my face.

09:30.059 --> 09:32.324
- They're here hovering all the time.
- They're just doing their job.

09:32.344 --> 09:34.499
Their job is to protect
me from Klaus Mikaelson,

09:34.501 --> 09:36.751
who by the way has not
set foot outside his house

09:36.753 --> 09:38.270
in months!

09:38.290 --> 09:41.497
All this waiting, I'm losing my mind.

09:42.365 --> 09:44.741
Anyone who is not paid to protect me, go.

09:44.761 --> 09:46.344
Get out!

09:55.739 --> 09:59.576
She's unraveling. Poor thing.

09:59.943 --> 10:01.884
Cracking under the pressure.

10:01.904 --> 10:06.031
I assume that was Elijah
and Niklaus' goal all along.

10:06.178 --> 10:09.951
Say what you will, they
are impressive strategists.

10:09.953 --> 10:11.733
Trait they inherited from you, dear mother.

10:11.753 --> 10:14.789
I suppose they did, Finn.

10:14.791 --> 10:18.009
Francesca Guerrera will be her own undoing.

10:18.157 --> 10:20.545
Let's see how impressive your brothers are

10:20.547 --> 10:23.181
when they finally come up against me.

10:47.129 --> 10:49.262
It never gets old for you guys, does it?

10:49.264 --> 10:51.085
Like a couple of dogs with a bone.

10:51.105 --> 10:53.633
Tell Francesca I'm just
trying to live a normal life.

10:53.635 --> 10:56.803
See if you can get that
through her thick canine skull.

10:59.141 --> 11:01.755
Why do I bother? Here.

11:01.775 --> 11:04.311
You're regular, extra sugar, right?

11:17.028 --> 11:18.358
Hello?

11:22.798 --> 11:24.297
Klaus?

11:38.514 --> 11:40.180
Klaus?

12:03.205 --> 12:07.040
Klaus, I know you're here
somewhere. We need to talk.

12:07.042 --> 12:08.508
He doesn't wish to see you.

12:08.510 --> 12:12.345
Ohh! Elijah.

12:12.347 --> 12:13.847
Where the hell did you come from?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.715
I beg your pardon.

12:15.717 --> 12:18.564
Aren't you the one who is trespassing?

12:18.584 --> 12:20.720
He doesn't care much for
conversation these days,

12:20.722 --> 12:22.055
and he certainly wouldn't care for the fact

12:22.057 --> 12:23.920
that you put yourself
in danger by coming here.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.310
I'm already in danger.

12:25.330 --> 12:27.477
I have Guerreras following
me like it's a police state.

12:27.479 --> 12:28.895
The city's being run by gangsters,

12:28.897 --> 12:30.485
and you guys aren't
doing anything about it.

12:30.505 --> 12:32.532
Marcel took them out a hundred
years ago without any of you.

12:32.534 --> 12:36.203
Don't you think he might be
up for lending you a hand?

12:36.540 --> 12:38.572
Thank you for coming, Camille.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.249
I know your family is grieving,

12:49.392 --> 12:50.834
but I know you don't believe those rumors

12:50.836 --> 12:52.385
that Marcel killed the baby,

12:52.387 --> 12:54.504
so if you want help
taking down the Guerreras,

12:54.506 --> 12:58.258
you have a weapon across the
river just waiting to be fired.

12:58.260 --> 12:59.893
Use it.

13:11.106 --> 13:13.173
I like her spirit.

13:16.745 --> 13:18.578
So do I.

13:29.315 --> 13:32.690
Dude, come on. This is, like,
the 20th group I've brought you.

13:32.710 --> 13:36.313
There's got to be a
keeper in here somewhere.

13:36.798 --> 13:38.715
I'll be the judge of that.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.688
I know you're all
wondering how you got here.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.306
Don't worry about that for now.

13:46.308 --> 13:50.110
Instead, I want you to
think about your lives.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.648
Don't be afraid.

13:56.652 --> 13:58.184
Remember when you were a kid

13:58.204 --> 14:00.320
and you felt like anything was possible,

14:00.322 --> 14:01.683
and then you grew up,

14:01.703 --> 14:03.573
and things didn't turn
out like you planned,

14:03.575 --> 14:07.160
but still there was that part
inside of you that would dream.

14:07.162 --> 14:08.912
Maybe you wanted strength,

14:08.914 --> 14:10.830
maybe you wanted to be a part of something,

14:10.832 --> 14:13.633
something bigger than yourselves.

14:13.635 --> 14:16.169
Maybe you wanted to be a fighter,

14:16.171 --> 14:18.638
have something worth fighting for.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.799
Maybe some of you even
wanted to live forever.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.895
Well, you can have it, all of it,

14:25.099 --> 14:28.932
because that's what being
a vampire's all about.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.767
Don't be afraid.

14:30.769 --> 14:34.154
What do you have to fear
when you can do this?

14:38.277 --> 14:41.027
I know. Pretty cool, right?

14:41.029 --> 14:43.580
When you leave here, you'll forget this,

14:43.582 --> 14:45.198
but somewhere deep down, you'll know

14:45.200 --> 14:48.001
that the offer still exists to join me.

14:48.003 --> 14:49.502
Be like me,

14:49.504 --> 14:51.824
and only then will you
find your way back here

14:51.844 --> 14:55.759
because you want it, because you need it.

14:57.379 --> 14:59.773
- My money's on the rocker chick.
- I wouldn't bet on it.

14:59.793 --> 15:01.746
Be lucky to get one from that group.

15:01.766 --> 15:03.383
How can you tell?

15:03.385 --> 15:05.717
They all seem tough.
What are you looking for?

15:05.866 --> 15:07.554
I'm not looking for tough guys, Josh.

15:07.556 --> 15:09.576
I'm looking for warriors.

15:09.596 --> 15:10.618
What's the difference?

15:10.638 --> 15:13.393
A warrior fights for what they believe in.

15:16.565 --> 15:20.900
A warrior fights for his family.

15:52.601 --> 15:54.228
What do you think you're doing, Elijah?

15:54.248 --> 15:56.653
Welcome back. What is it,
the third night this week?

15:56.655 --> 15:58.021
I don't need a caretaker.

15:58.023 --> 16:00.273
Hybrids are invincible, right?

16:00.275 --> 16:01.847
What are you doing, Elijah?

16:01.867 --> 16:04.611
As we have discussed, our
illusion needs to be flawless.

16:04.613 --> 16:06.021
Now months have passed.

16:06.030 --> 16:09.137
- It's the appropriate time.
- What's next on the appropriate list,

16:09.157 --> 16:11.001
Klaus and I hold our heads up high

16:11.003 --> 16:12.369
and say we're ready to try again?

16:12.371 --> 16:14.287
I understand that this
is difficult for you.

16:14.289 --> 16:16.206
What's difficult is knowing that

16:16.208 --> 16:19.376
Francesca Guerrera is still breathing
after she was the one that plotted

16:19.378 --> 16:20.593
with the witches to kill my baby.

16:20.595 --> 16:22.128
You will have your vengeance,

16:22.130 --> 16:25.598
I promise you this.

16:25.600 --> 16:30.553
Well, until then, this is my room,

16:30.555 --> 16:32.272
and I'll tell you when it's appropriate

16:32.274 --> 16:33.973
to clean it out.

17:02.749 --> 17:04.838
I don't know why you keep showing off.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.099
You know you can't hurt me.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.142
Oh, but the desire I have to do so.

17:11.311 --> 17:15.928
I am Mikael, the vampire
who hunts vampires.

17:15.948 --> 17:19.152
You know thin human blood
does little to sustain me.

17:19.154 --> 17:20.603
Feed.

17:29.698 --> 17:31.164
Stop.

17:37.341 --> 17:41.478
Oh, I wish I could rip this from you

17:41.498 --> 17:43.676
and break that which binds me to you

17:43.678 --> 17:46.963
and complete the task for
which you resurrected me...

17:46.965 --> 17:50.216
kill the bastard who calls himself my son.

17:50.218 --> 17:51.718
You can't take off the bracelet,

17:51.720 --> 17:53.186
and you can't kill Klaus,

17:53.188 --> 17:56.689
not until I figure out how to
save my friends from dying, too.

18:02.564 --> 18:04.547
I've studied their mother's
spell book for weeks.

18:04.549 --> 18:05.605
I'm getting close.

18:05.625 --> 18:08.818
Once I unlink my friends
from Klaus' sire line,

18:08.820 --> 18:12.906
I will unleash you to be the
monster that you are so eager to be.

18:12.908 --> 18:15.992
Music to my ears, my little witch.

18:16.342 --> 18:17.911
The wolves have the numbers.

18:17.913 --> 18:21.199
Back in 1925, the
Guerrera pack was may 100.

18:21.219 --> 18:22.582
We went guerrilla warfare on their asses

18:22.584 --> 18:25.335
and wiped them out over a 4-day fight,

18:25.337 --> 18:27.987
but we're not just talking
about Guerreras now.

18:27.989 --> 18:31.224
They've had wolves coming
in from packs all over.

18:31.226 --> 18:32.842
Well, we don't need to hit them all,

18:32.844 --> 18:35.762
just the 12 with the rings
that take me out very full moon.

18:35.764 --> 18:37.397
What, you want to find 12 rings?

18:37.399 --> 18:39.032
Go out and chop off the hand of every wolf

18:39.034 --> 18:40.567
you find until you get what you want.

18:40.569 --> 18:42.519
I mean, come on. You taught me that.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.289
You and Elijah are stalling.

18:44.309 --> 18:46.071
Why?

18:47.177 --> 18:51.911
Because it's possible they're in possession
of something very dangerous to us.

18:54.282 --> 18:57.283
Yeah. The stake that can kill you.

18:57.285 --> 18:58.952
It went missing

18:58.954 --> 19:02.002
the night I lost my child.

19:02.958 --> 19:06.125
So it's in play,

19:06.127 --> 19:08.294
and the thought of that
makes me very nervous,

19:08.314 --> 19:10.930
especially on nights like tonight.

19:14.302 --> 19:15.988
Why would you tell me that?

19:16.008 --> 19:17.520
Depends.

19:17.522 --> 19:18.805
Do you have it?

19:18.807 --> 19:21.399
Of course not. That kind
of weapon does me no good.

19:21.419 --> 19:23.092
You die, I die

19:23.094 --> 19:25.945
along with every vampire we've ever sired.

19:26.155 --> 19:30.883
Well, then perhaps, you'd
like to help me get it back.

19:31.454 --> 19:33.119
We attack the wolves tonight

19:33.121 --> 19:36.022
when the moon hits its apex.

19:36.042 --> 19:39.242
They won't expect it while I'm weak.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.202
Hey. Bad news or good news?

19:42.947 --> 19:45.298
Klaus, Joe. Joe, Klaus.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.333
Now you want to talk Guerreras,

19:47.335 --> 19:50.670
nobody fought harder back
in 1925 than Joe here.

19:50.672 --> 19:53.290
Fought so hard, he retired into retail.

19:53.310 --> 19:56.320
Been keeping the peace ever since
and living right under their noses.

19:56.340 --> 20:00.094
Yeah. Well, good news is your
order came in this morning.

20:00.114 --> 20:02.315
The bad news, I got made.

20:02.317 --> 20:05.485
Your friend Davina saved my
ass, but what's done is done,

20:05.487 --> 20:09.105
so pour me a drink, play me a
song because it's gonna be my last.

20:09.107 --> 20:11.491
Joe, don't be dramatic.

20:11.493 --> 20:13.243
Just head out of town
till things blow over.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.636
No way. I don't run from Guerreras.

20:15.656 --> 20:18.317
You don't leave, you won't have
to. They'll sniff you out in a day.

20:18.337 --> 20:20.366
You let them come hunt me down

20:20.368 --> 20:23.202
because I've had a good ride.

20:23.367 --> 20:28.007
How would you like to get
back in the fight, Joe?

20:35.016 --> 20:36.883
So what do you have in mind?

20:36.885 --> 20:40.277
I've been thinking about this
whole thing the wrong way.

20:41.556 --> 20:44.857
Guerrera pack loves to hunt.

20:44.859 --> 20:47.060
They're primal, alphas.

20:47.062 --> 20:50.425
I gave you my reason for not
making a move these past few months.

20:50.445 --> 20:54.033
What, pray tell, is theirs?

20:56.621 --> 20:59.217
They don't have the stake.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.408
Well, then who the hell does?

21:02.410 --> 21:04.794
Tonight, it doesn't matter

21:04.796 --> 21:07.463
because tonight

21:07.465 --> 21:09.916
we're going on a wolf hunt.

21:17.325 --> 21:19.013
We have the Guerreras where we want them,

21:19.033 --> 21:20.474
we have them waiting, we have them worried,

21:20.494 --> 21:23.009
and now we know they're an army
with no defenses against an original.

21:23.029 --> 21:25.482
- We don't know that for certain.
- I'm willing to gamble.

21:25.502 --> 21:27.865
It's too risky. The stake
didn't just disappear.

21:27.885 --> 21:29.999
- Someone has it.
- One enemy at a time.

21:30.019 --> 21:31.757
In the end, we'll slay them all.

21:38.571 --> 21:41.778
Tonight, we just have
to plant the right seeds,

21:41.798 --> 21:44.545
and for that, we need help.

21:53.993 --> 21:57.495
You know, I am starting to
think that you have a death wish.

21:57.497 --> 22:01.478
Look. I just want to get my
stuff and get out of town.

22:02.346 --> 22:05.169
And why would we let you do that?

22:05.349 --> 22:09.695
Because I got information that could
be very useful to Francesca Guerrera.

22:10.217 --> 22:11.976
We're taking the 12 original rings.

22:11.978 --> 22:14.512
Now 4 of them sit on the
hands of the Guerrera brothers,

22:14.514 --> 22:16.347
one on Oliver, one on Francesca,

22:16.349 --> 22:19.159
3 with her home security detail, and
the rest scattered amongst her lackeys.

22:19.179 --> 22:21.462
Now each ring is
distinguishable by its setting...

22:21.482 --> 22:24.355
gauche like those that wear them.

22:24.527 --> 22:26.691
Klaus thinks you have the white oak stake.

22:26.693 --> 22:27.892
But we don't.

22:27.894 --> 22:29.360
That doesn't matter

22:29.362 --> 22:31.282
because if they think you have it

22:31.302 --> 22:32.947
it means they don't know where it is.

22:32.949 --> 22:35.464
Do a spell. Find it now.

22:35.602 --> 22:37.501
If they believe they can
get their hands on the stake,

22:37.503 --> 22:39.287
they will come for it when I am week.

22:39.289 --> 22:42.039
Each ring we retrieve will strengthen me,

22:42.041 --> 22:43.708
but I will still be at a disadvantage.

22:43.710 --> 22:47.962
Ergo any hope of our success depends
entirely upon our working together.

22:47.964 --> 22:51.975
The two of you can no longer afford
to retreat to separate corners.

23:01.054 --> 23:03.536
This is our fight.

23:03.958 --> 23:06.688
Are you ready for battle, Hayley?

23:07.400 --> 23:11.068
Just promise me that Francesca
doesn't come out of this alive.

23:13.570 --> 23:19.160
Her head will be delivered to you
on a silver platter, little wolf.

23:21.592 --> 23:23.560
I'll take care of the
last piece of the puzzle.

23:23.580 --> 23:25.466
L'arme filium.

23:25.468 --> 23:27.718
Pa kenbe ex oculus.

23:27.738 --> 23:29.840
Indi...

23:30.348 --> 23:32.473
It's no good. I can't find it.

23:32.475 --> 23:34.141
It must be cloaked.

23:34.143 --> 23:36.177
I'd love to know by whom.

23:38.181 --> 23:40.765
I'm afraid you'll have to tell
us the whole story this time,

23:40.767 --> 23:43.100
not just enough to keep yourself alive.

23:43.102 --> 23:45.502
- Francesca, I told you that...
- And I'm telling you

23:45.522 --> 23:49.103
give me something I don't already
know, or you die right now.

23:49.123 --> 23:53.054
Spill, and you walk out that door.

23:53.513 --> 23:56.169
Who has the white oak stake?

23:56.916 --> 24:01.786
Rumor has it it landed in
the hands of the priest.

24:02.486 --> 24:03.972
It's not enough I can't even go on a walk.

24:03.992 --> 24:08.292
- Now you have to do this?
- You know how to stop this.

24:08.779 --> 24:10.640
Where's the stake?

24:11.597 --> 24:14.366
Fine. Whatever.

24:14.767 --> 24:18.300
What do I care? This is not even my fight.

24:18.805 --> 24:21.522
There. That's where
you'll find what you want.

24:21.524 --> 24:23.808
Now all you need is my Uncle's key.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.476
And where's that?

24:30.230 --> 24:32.950
Hiding in plain sight, genius.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.116
Klaus will be at his lowest strength

25:10.136 --> 25:12.263
for the next few hours.

25:12.283 --> 25:14.304
Once you retrieve the white oak stake,

25:14.306 --> 25:16.792
be ready to use it.

25:16.812 --> 25:20.393
You take a group to the compound
and subdue him while he's still weak.

25:20.716 --> 25:23.333
What about Elijah and Hayley? There's
no way they leave his side tonight.

25:23.353 --> 25:25.249
Elijah can be weakened by your bites.

25:25.269 --> 25:26.626
As for Hayley,

25:26.646 --> 25:29.736
whoever rips out her heart gets a bonus.

25:32.436 --> 25:35.458
- And where will you be?
- Here, where it's safe.

25:35.460 --> 25:36.910
They're vampires.

25:36.930 --> 25:39.412
They can't get into the
house without an invitation.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.047
So we risk our lives while you hide?

25:41.049 --> 25:42.916
I am the top dog.

25:42.918 --> 25:45.919
Your job is to ensure the
battle doesn't come to me.

25:50.092 --> 25:51.675
Start from the corners.

25:51.677 --> 25:53.977
Work the room from the outside in.

25:58.767 --> 26:01.768
Well, look what we have here.

26:07.409 --> 26:09.275
I know your boss wanted to buy this place,

26:09.277 --> 26:11.695
but I've been stockpiling
wolfsbane for months,

26:11.697 --> 26:15.248
and I just really needed
a place to store it.

26:20.391 --> 26:22.455
Get back! Get back!

26:24.710 --> 26:26.176
I'm gonna need that.

26:27.462 --> 26:28.928
Ahh.

27:11.208 --> 27:12.672
Aah!

27:35.350 --> 27:37.330
Aah!

27:55.267 --> 27:56.716
Good evening.

28:04.925 --> 28:08.728
Have I mentioned that I've
had a rotten couple of months?

28:20.408 --> 28:21.908
Hyah!

28:33.042 --> 28:34.971
You think you're strong
because of that ring you wear?

28:34.991 --> 28:36.480
You're nothing. We were strong.

28:36.500 --> 28:39.690
We were part of a pack, and you ruined it.

28:45.379 --> 28:47.257
If I see you with one of these again,

28:47.277 --> 28:49.569
I will kill you myself.

29:12.961 --> 29:14.511
Hmm.

29:14.513 --> 29:16.179
It's fine.

29:16.181 --> 29:17.928
He can't come in.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.628
Can't I?

29:20.149 --> 29:21.851
Don't bluff me.

29:21.853 --> 29:23.369
You can't win.

29:23.371 --> 29:26.823
You mobsters all suffer from such hubris.

29:27.107 --> 29:31.446
Do you know Al Capone thought
himself invincible back in his day,

29:31.466 --> 29:33.479
and in the end,

29:33.481 --> 29:38.505
he was sentenced to the wretched filth
of Alcatraz for which of his atrocities?

29:39.212 --> 29:40.787
Anyone?

29:40.789 --> 29:42.956
A failure to pay his taxes.

29:42.958 --> 29:46.876
I suppose the devil's
in the details, isn't it?

29:46.878 --> 29:50.663
My, my, you have a beautiful home here.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.916
I was so pleased when the city

29:52.918 --> 29:55.699
took my suggestion to
protect its heritage status

29:55.719 --> 29:58.838
and invoke eminent domain.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.641
So I suppose that means

30:01.871 --> 30:04.143
this house now belongs to the public,

30:04.145 --> 30:06.846
and as such, anyone can enter...

30:08.900 --> 30:11.351
Without invitation.

30:33.197 --> 30:36.365
I'm still not at full strength.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.692
Which of the rings are unaccounted for?

30:38.712 --> 30:40.503
Only one.

30:40.846 --> 30:44.115
I must say the brothers fought valiantly

30:44.135 --> 30:47.088
before Miss Guerrera escaped.

30:47.745 --> 30:50.579
You let her get away.

30:50.581 --> 30:52.247
Not exactly.

31:01.897 --> 31:03.592
Aah!

31:23.948 --> 31:25.748
Marcel.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.116
They got Joe.

31:29.668 --> 31:33.122
Joe knew what he was getting himself into.

31:33.471 --> 31:35.591
So what? "Hey. Come on. Join our team.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.793
Your reward will be your death"?

31:40.631 --> 31:42.617
Here's what you got to understand.

31:42.637 --> 31:45.826
Vamps like Joe, they know what
it feels like to be in the battle

31:45.846 --> 31:47.891
and what it is to sit on the sidelines.

31:47.911 --> 31:49.987
Joe sat it out for a long time,

31:50.007 --> 31:52.341
but when the fight came
to him, he got back in

31:52.343 --> 31:54.805
because he'd rather die on his
feet than live on his knees.

31:54.825 --> 31:57.095
That's a warrior.

31:57.097 --> 31:59.029
But what are we fighting for?

31:59.049 --> 32:01.850
Me... I'm fighting for my home,

32:01.852 --> 32:05.214
for the dignity of the vampires
who were run out of there.

32:05.234 --> 32:07.969
The question is

32:08.416 --> 32:10.776
what are you fighting for?

32:12.735 --> 32:15.697
That's the problem. I have no idea.

32:15.699 --> 32:17.858
Look. The werewolves took over the
quarter. We beat them back today,

32:17.878 --> 32:20.120
they'll fight us back tomorrow. It's nuts!

32:20.140 --> 32:23.372
And all for a few measly
blocks of real estate?

32:26.081 --> 32:29.222
I was born here in a time
far more shameful than now,

32:29.242 --> 32:31.612
and even then, this city
was worth fighting for.

32:31.632 --> 32:35.105
My blood runs through the gutters
of this city along with the blood

32:35.125 --> 32:36.470
of my closest friends,

32:36.490 --> 32:38.395
and, yeah, Klaus and I fought side by side

32:38.415 --> 32:40.133
against the Guerreras,
but, you know, before long,

32:40.153 --> 32:42.357
he's gonna want to be king of the wolves.

32:42.359 --> 32:44.893
His blood runs deep here, too.

32:47.765 --> 32:50.267
You hear that?

32:51.037 --> 32:53.902
That is the first, last, and only album

32:53.904 --> 32:56.733
that my friend Thierry Vanchure ever made.

32:56.753 --> 33:00.075
It could have only been made here.

33:00.077 --> 33:02.411
We're not fighting for real estate.

33:02.413 --> 33:05.545
We're fighting for the soul of this city.

33:06.050 --> 33:07.549
Hello?

33:10.890 --> 33:13.893
Hi. I'm sorry.

33:14.712 --> 33:16.412
This is weird.

33:16.432 --> 33:19.061
I just kind of found my way here.

33:27.264 --> 33:30.522
Hayley, Hayley! Hayley, please.

33:34.662 --> 33:36.495
I killed her.

33:36.497 --> 33:38.280
Aah!

33:40.502 --> 33:43.436
Francesca looked me in the
eye and begged me for her life

33:43.456 --> 33:45.754
as I tore her apart...

33:47.981 --> 33:50.125
But I don't feel better.

33:50.127 --> 33:53.428
I don't feel peace. I don't feel anything!

33:53.448 --> 33:55.339
It's perfectly natural given
what you've experienced.

33:55.359 --> 33:58.482
Nothing about what I
am, Elijah, is natural.

33:58.502 --> 34:02.082
As a hybrid, you will begin to experience
feelings with a greater intensity.

34:02.102 --> 34:04.129
It will take time to master control.

34:04.149 --> 34:08.476
I don't want to live like this, Elijah.

34:09.306 --> 34:11.279
I hate it.

34:13.817 --> 34:15.951
When I was living with
the crescents in the Bayou,

34:15.971 --> 34:19.286
I finally understood the... the purity

34:19.289 --> 34:21.989
of being a wolf, the nobility.

34:24.161 --> 34:28.433
I killed 8 wolves tonight
before I got to Francesca,

34:28.453 --> 34:32.355
8 of my own people.

34:32.375 --> 34:34.228
What's noble about that?

34:34.248 --> 34:37.222
I acted no better than a...

34:37.224 --> 34:39.091
Than a vampire.

34:45.237 --> 34:48.092
Everything has changed,

34:49.018 --> 34:51.018
and not just for me.

34:54.270 --> 34:57.819
I saw the way you looked at me before,

34:58.278 --> 35:01.329
and I see the way that you look at me now.

35:04.868 --> 35:08.512
I was a mother, and now I'm a monster.

35:12.145 --> 35:15.544
Things are different now.

35:15.546 --> 35:17.929
You can't tell me that they're not.

35:22.612 --> 35:24.186
Hayley.

35:42.363 --> 35:44.438
Wow. This sucks.

35:44.686 --> 35:46.615
No trades today.

35:46.617 --> 35:48.322
I mean, worse for you of course.

35:48.342 --> 35:53.330
Guy had the market cornered on
the ancient Icelandic folk scene.

35:53.791 --> 35:56.097
Those weren't for me.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.132
I'm Kaleb.

35:58.454 --> 36:00.902
- Davina.
- Wow. Cool name.

36:01.138 --> 36:03.421
Terrible taste in music.

36:03.441 --> 36:06.272
You obviously need me.

36:07.587 --> 36:10.021
Could you not just take
a sledgehammer to them?

36:10.023 --> 36:13.221
These were forged by a witch,
brother, and as such, only the elements

36:13.241 --> 36:16.211
of water and fire can destroy them.

36:16.213 --> 36:18.747
I'd have though this would
bring you greater pleasure.

36:18.749 --> 36:20.348
As would I.

36:22.403 --> 36:25.161
This was my fault,

36:25.939 --> 36:28.359
all of it.

36:28.769 --> 36:33.167
If had just accepted Hayley's
pregnancy instead of...

36:33.187 --> 36:35.917
playing king.

36:37.251 --> 36:39.904
I should have listened to you.

36:39.924 --> 36:44.944
Instead, my greed and my
envy robbed me of my daughter.

36:46.059 --> 36:48.220
My actions...

36:48.240 --> 36:50.929
led to the release of a weapon
that can kill not just me

36:50.931 --> 36:52.481
but you.

36:52.483 --> 36:54.433
A thousand years I've
survived your attempts

36:54.435 --> 36:56.601
to destroy me, brother.

37:00.574 --> 37:04.266
I imagine I can survive this.

37:05.412 --> 37:08.068
You chase my redemption

37:08.088 --> 37:11.377
like a man rolling a stone
up an endless mountain.

37:11.898 --> 37:14.419
Well, no mountain is endless, brother.

37:20.961 --> 37:23.428
Some are just steeper than others.

37:27.776 --> 37:31.303
And as much as I would like to be the
one to comfort Hayley in this moment,

37:31.305 --> 37:35.788
I believe that only you
can understand her grief.

37:35.808 --> 37:38.226
We lost our child.

37:40.752 --> 37:44.583
I mean, what could I
possibly say to ease her pain?

37:48.121 --> 37:50.071
Whatever she needs to hear.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.178
Do you think things will be
better in the quarter now?

37:58.198 --> 38:02.901
No, but it as nice fighting
with Klaus for a change.

38:03.621 --> 38:05.979
I'm sorry about Joe.

38:05.999 --> 38:08.056
Guy was brave.

38:12.312 --> 38:13.979
So were you.

38:17.249 --> 38:19.644
Doesn't matter.

38:20.020 --> 38:23.442
This has to stop, Marcel, us.

38:23.462 --> 38:26.500
The deeper I'm in it with you,
the deeper I'm into everything,

38:26.520 --> 38:29.485
and I have to get my
certification, I have to help...

38:29.505 --> 38:33.865
human people with their human problems,

38:33.867 --> 38:38.591
and I can't do that if I keep
letting myself get pulled back in.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.840
I'm sorry. This has to end.

38:52.352 --> 38:55.849
- It will get better.
- When?

38:57.003 --> 38:59.160
I'm immortal now. If I
can't get through today,

38:59.180 --> 39:01.860
how am I supposed to get through forever?

39:06.533 --> 39:08.468
You know, over the years,

39:08.488 --> 39:12.488
I've had my share of friends, enemies,

39:12.739 --> 39:16.832
lovers, losses, and triumphs.

39:17.378 --> 39:21.684
With time, they all begin to run together,

39:22.788 --> 39:29.988
but you will find the
real moments are vibrant.

39:34.061 --> 39:37.548
The rest just fades away.

39:38.057 --> 39:40.732
Your pain will fade.

39:40.734 --> 39:43.602
Not until I can hold my
baby in my arms again.

39:43.604 --> 39:45.770
And so you shall.

39:47.407 --> 39:51.851
But in order to do that, we need
to regain control of the city.

39:52.285 --> 39:55.415
Now we worked separately
once to unite those wolves.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.872
We can work together to do it again.

39:57.892 --> 40:00.183
They don't need to be our enemies.

40:00.203 --> 40:03.786
After ambushing them, they're not
gonna want to be our friends, Klaus.

40:03.806 --> 40:08.426
You waged a just war on those
who would harm your child.

40:08.428 --> 40:11.452
Not only will they respect
you. They will answer to you.

40:11.472 --> 40:13.465
Why would they do that now?

40:15.746 --> 40:17.802
Because you're their queen.

40:24.778 --> 40:27.195
What about all our other enemies?

40:27.197 --> 40:30.115
The witches don't stop plotting
even after they're dead.

40:30.117 --> 40:33.118
We defeated my mother and her witches

40:33.120 --> 40:36.154
because we stood united.

40:40.827 --> 40:43.995
That is how we will face all our enemies...

40:46.333 --> 40:48.133
as a family.

41:06.109 --> 41:08.169
Mr. Griffith? Cami.

41:08.189 --> 41:10.908
I can't thank you enough for
sponsoring my supervised residency.

41:10.928 --> 41:13.441
Please. Um, call me Vincent.

41:15.041 --> 41:16.661
Did she buy it?

41:16.663 --> 41:19.447
Entirely. The humans are weak.

41:19.449 --> 41:21.666
Their bodies are so strange.

41:21.668 --> 41:23.725
I've forgotten what it feels
like to be this vulnerable.

41:23.745 --> 41:26.368
At least you're not stuck
in the body of a teenager.

41:26.388 --> 41:29.207
Well, I love my body, Mother.

41:29.209 --> 41:31.258
I'm pretty sure Davina Claire does, too.

41:31.278 --> 41:34.546
Don't be puerile. We have work to do.

41:34.548 --> 41:37.582
Your brothers did me a
favor by killing Francesca.

41:37.584 --> 41:40.937
Now I will control the
witches and the werewolves.

41:40.957 --> 41:42.854
With the vampires in exile,

41:42.856 --> 41:44.838
we can begin to take root

41:44.858 --> 41:47.204
in our new home.

41:47.224 --> 41:49.855
Finn, Kol,

41:50.637 --> 41:51.645
let's get to work.

41:52.498 --> 41:55.911
We have a family reunion to plan.
