00:57.390 --> 01:00.143
- Hey Jim.
- Hey, Eric, how're you doing?

01:00.226 --> 01:02.937
This is the woman
I've been telling you about.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.105
Wow.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.818
So you're the one that can sing
the feathers off a bird.

01:09.319 --> 01:12.197
I'm Kathy Meadows.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.656
Jim Kosub.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.409
Honey, you could smile
the feathers off a bird.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.498
Compared to her voice,
her looks are quite inconsequential.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.251
This I gotta hear.
Got your background mix?

01:25.335 --> 01:26.836
Yeah. Why don't you lace it up?

01:26.919 --> 01:30.048
Kathy, why don't you step out there
and let Jim hear what you got?

01:30.131 --> 01:33.885
And if everything goes fine,
we'll make a cut tomorrow. Okay?

01:34.594 --> 01:36.345
Okay. I'll try.

01:54.071 --> 01:55.448
She'll try.

01:56.407 --> 02:00.286
Jimbo, she very well could be the lady
to put Phoenix Records...

02:00.369 --> 02:02.079
on the map to stay.

02:11.547 --> 02:13.883
Don't you need to get a level in there?

02:13.966 --> 02:16.844
No, we'll catch it as we go along.
You ready, honey?

03:25.078 --> 03:27.080
Jim. Use your headset, so we can talk?

03:27.164 --> 03:28.290
No problem.

03:28.540 --> 03:29.916
Real good voice.

03:30.417 --> 03:34.129
Too bad she had the misfortune
of signing with your company.

05:05.553 --> 05:07.972
After all, $1 million is nothing...

05:08.055 --> 05:11.726
compared to what you stand
to make off Farewell to the Master.

05:12.018 --> 05:15.354
Billy Dero's disappearance was
the best thing that could've happened.

05:15.438 --> 05:19.066
As far as the sales of his last album
are concerned, right?

05:19.692 --> 05:22.027
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

05:22.111 --> 05:23.362
I know all of that.

05:23.446 --> 05:27.324
Just $1 million, Mr. Landau.
The master tape is yours once more.

05:28.993 --> 05:31.453
I haven't gone to the cops, have I?

05:31.829 --> 05:33.873
- I intend to pay.
- When?

05:36.709 --> 05:40.087
I don't know,
I'll have to get a loan from a bank.

05:40.838 --> 05:42.381
Maybe a week from now.

05:42.464 --> 05:45.301
- Make it two days.
- Two days? That's impossible!

05:45.384 --> 05:47.678
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Landau.

05:47.761 --> 05:50.389
Twenty years ago,
putting a man on the moon...

05:50.472 --> 05:54.476
that was considered impossible.
Don't set your sights so low.

05:55.060 --> 05:58.981
Be bold, imaginative. We have faith in you.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.652
If you don't get the money up
in two days...

06:03.735 --> 06:07.281
you don't get back the tape
you paid $100,000 for.

06:07.573 --> 06:10.868
And then your whole company
will go down the tubes.

06:12.077 --> 06:13.245
Won't it?

06:37.310 --> 06:40.021
Extortion makes strange bedfellows,
Steve.

06:40.105 --> 06:43.191
It looks like the trail we picked up
in the aerospace industry...

06:43.275 --> 06:45.318
is going to end up in the music industry.

06:45.402 --> 06:48.113
So, you think Kobler's extorting
Phoenix Records?

06:48.196 --> 06:52.158
I have a pretty good hunch.
About six weeks ago a pop music star...

06:52.242 --> 06:56.079
named Billy Dero set sail for Catalina
and was never seen again.

06:56.162 --> 06:58.623
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- Well, apparently...

06:58.707 --> 07:00.458
Phoenix Records paid a small fortune...

07:00.542 --> 07:03.795
to acquire the rights to the last songs
Billy ever recorded.

07:03.878 --> 07:06.464
They were going to compile
and market a memorial album...

07:06.548 --> 07:08.216
called Farewell to the Master.

07:08.299 --> 07:10.176
Seems I've heard something
about that, too.

07:10.260 --> 07:13.221
Judging from the bits and pieces
I've overheard...

07:13.471 --> 07:16.766
chances are the master tape
for that album has been stolen.

07:16.891 --> 07:20.311
- And being held for ransom by Kobler.
- Right.

07:20.395 --> 07:23.898
You see, without that master tape
Phoenix can't press any discs.

07:23.982 --> 07:27.443
Eric Landau stands to lose his company
if he doesn't get that tape back.

07:27.527 --> 07:31.281
Which means he's more than willing
to go along with Kobler's demands.

07:31.489 --> 07:34.826
Looks like what we've heard through
the grapevine has been 100% correct.

07:34.909 --> 07:36.369
Let's just hope we can make it pay off.

07:36.452 --> 07:40.248
I think a Kobler employee
just made contact with Eric.

07:40.415 --> 07:44.252
I fully intend to be around if,
and when, Eric drops the ransom.

07:45.002 --> 07:47.880
With any luck,
this will be Kobler's last scam.

07:48.339 --> 07:50.842
Good. How are you doing?

07:50.925 --> 07:54.387
Were those strings I pulled
to get you that audition good enough?

07:54.762 --> 07:56.389
Everything's just fine.

07:56.514 --> 07:59.350
Kathy Meadows
starts cutting a demo tomorrow.

08:00.351 --> 08:03.521
I just can't get over the fact that
you can sing so well.

08:04.230 --> 08:07.942
There are quite a few things
you don't know about me, Steve.

08:08.734 --> 08:10.278
That's probably true.

08:10.444 --> 08:13.322
Anyway, the LA field office
is still trying to locate...

08:13.406 --> 08:15.199
Kobler's base of operations out there.

08:15.283 --> 08:17.284
They'll let you know if they find anything.

08:23.666 --> 08:26.377
Just how much trouble
is the Senator giving us?

08:30.005 --> 08:33.676
Maybe he's forgotten how much trouble
those photographs can make for him.

08:33.926 --> 08:36.720
Perhaps, if we leaked one of them
to the press...

08:40.307 --> 08:43.727
No, not that one.
We don't want to ruin his career...

08:43.811 --> 08:45.896
just give it a little jolt.

08:48.357 --> 08:52.569
Yeah, that one will do. That'll do.
Get on it, Greg.

08:53.696 --> 08:55.030
Okay.

09:04.373 --> 09:08.210
Well, Martin,
what did Mr. Landau have to say?

09:08.544 --> 09:10.796
He wanted a week
to get the million together.

09:10.879 --> 09:11.964
Out of the question.

09:12.047 --> 09:14.842
The longer these things drag out,
the riskier they become.

09:14.925 --> 09:18.762
I know. I told him two days.
He didn't like that at all.

09:19.137 --> 09:22.558
I wouldn't want him to overreact
and do something rash.

09:22.683 --> 09:25.394
He probably needs a reminder
that doing things my way...

09:25.477 --> 09:27.062
is best for his health.

09:27.312 --> 09:29.231
Could you meet with him again
this afternoon?

09:29.314 --> 09:33.276
There's a press party going on,
but no problem.

09:34.277 --> 09:35.529
I like crowds.

09:35.946 --> 09:39.658
Go remind Mr. Landau where
his priorities lie for the next 48 hours.

09:41.785 --> 09:44.746
Take the tape with you.
Just the first song.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.873
Yes, ma'am.

09:53.964 --> 09:57.259
Just relax, smile,
and answer their questions honestly.

09:57.551 --> 10:00.428
Reporters recognize a fledgling superstar
when they see one.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.972
Oh, Eric...

10:03.723 --> 10:05.517
Just wait till you cut your first album.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.436
I'm telling you, you got a heck of a future
in this business.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.438
You're dynamite.

10:11.272 --> 10:14.693
That's my personal
as well as my professional opinion.

10:16.319 --> 10:19.155
- That's Jeff and Barbi Gordon, right?
- That's right.

10:19.239 --> 10:22.867
Jeff, Barbi. I'd like for you
to meet Kathy Meadows.

10:22.951 --> 10:25.453
- Nice to meet you, Kathy.
- Nice to meet you.

10:26.079 --> 10:27.956
Eric speaks very highly of you.

10:28.039 --> 10:29.290
Are you two leaving?

10:29.374 --> 10:33.378
We were just getting some fresh air.
That room upstairs was getting so stuffy...

10:33.545 --> 10:36.381
our throats were getting scratchy.
Weren't they, Jeff?

10:36.464 --> 10:37.966
Oh, yeah. A little.

10:38.049 --> 10:40.176
So this is your first press party, is it?

10:40.260 --> 10:43.805
Yes. I guess I'm just green enough
to be excited about it all.

10:43.888 --> 10:48.559
Of course. After a while, though,
the charm of these affairs wears thin.

10:48.643 --> 10:52.563
If it weren't absolutely necessary
to make an appearance now and then...

10:52.647 --> 10:54.524
we'd never attend these things.

10:54.607 --> 10:56.859
- Isn't that right, Jeff?
- Oh, yeah.

10:56.984 --> 10:59.278
These so-called singers
and their immoral music...

10:59.362 --> 11:01.823
I tell you,
there are days I look to heaven and ask...

11:01.906 --> 11:04.158
whatever happened to
Engelbert Humperdinck?

11:04.242 --> 11:06.244
- Don't I, Jeff?
- Yeah, a couple of times-

11:06.327 --> 11:08.663
Call me old-fashioned, but we work hard.

11:20.383 --> 11:22.843
- That's Antimatter.
- It certainly is.

11:28.140 --> 11:30.559
I'd like for you to meet Kathy Meadows.

11:30.643 --> 11:33.979
- Kathy, this is Anton...
- Charmed.

11:34.063 --> 11:37.691
...and Kim, and, of course, Jerry.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.695
And you do know Jeff and Barbi Gordon?

11:42.363 --> 11:46.200
Oh, I have all your records!
I think your music is just wonderful!

11:46.283 --> 11:48.827
You guys ever thought
about doing milk commercials?

11:48.911 --> 11:51.247
Honey, every time you sing, I just melt.

12:03.884 --> 12:05.844
That's just what I was talking about!

12:05.928 --> 12:07.888
They probably call themselves
Antimatter...

12:07.971 --> 12:11.475
because if they came into contact
with anything normal or decent...

12:11.558 --> 12:13.894
they'd blow up!

12:13.977 --> 12:16.605
Not that I mind you handling them, Eric...

12:17.022 --> 12:21.401
It's just that sometimes he tends
to focus on them to the exclusion...

12:21.485 --> 12:24.780
of his more moderate,
ultimately more popular artists.

12:24.863 --> 12:27.366
Excuse me,
I have some business to take care of.

12:27.449 --> 12:30.369
- Kathy, I'll see you a little later, okay?
- Sure.

12:32.913 --> 12:35.832
I guess I'd better be going, too.
It was nice to meet you.

12:35.916 --> 12:38.752
- I'm sure we'll see each other.
- Nice to meet you.

12:39.544 --> 12:41.088
What are you looking at?

12:41.171 --> 12:43.799
She's a very attractive woman, Barbi.

12:44.049 --> 12:47.052
Lord knows what kind of songs she does.

12:47.511 --> 12:48.929
Who cares?

13:01.525 --> 13:05.695
This is your office, Mr. Landau.
Please come in.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.001
What are you doing back here?

13:20.085 --> 13:22.462
My superiors feel
you need some encouragement...

13:22.545 --> 13:25.256
when it comes to meeting your
two-day deadline.

13:28.218 --> 13:29.636
Recognize this?

13:30.386 --> 13:32.764
Yeah, it's the master tape.

13:33.014 --> 13:36.768
In fact, this envelope holds
the first song from the master.

13:37.435 --> 13:38.937
Now, watch carefully.

13:56.788 --> 14:01.209
Get the picture? We burn a song a day
till you hand over the money.

14:02.376 --> 14:06.506
If you don't hurry, you won't have
enough left for a memorial single.

14:10.635 --> 14:12.637
Good day, Mr. Landau.

14:59.683 --> 15:01.352
What're you doing here?

15:02.686 --> 15:06.190
Well, you left so quickly.
You seemed upset. I was worried.

15:06.357 --> 15:09.526
So I went to your office
and I'm afraid I overheard.

15:09.693 --> 15:11.070
Then you know everything.

15:11.153 --> 15:13.530
Everything. You're being blackmailed.

15:14.364 --> 15:16.033
The proper term is "extorted. "

15:16.116 --> 15:17.451
What are you going to do?

15:17.534 --> 15:19.703
Pay the ransom. I can get a bank loan...

15:19.787 --> 15:22.748
if I put up my shares of Phoenix
as collateral.

15:22.831 --> 15:24.791
If word of that ever gets out...

15:24.875 --> 15:28.670
investors will start deserting
like rats aboard the SS Poseidon.

15:30.088 --> 15:32.382
I'm taking an awful big chance.

15:32.674 --> 15:36.762
I'm sorry, Eric.
I hope everything works out.

15:36.845 --> 15:38.221
I really do.

15:38.555 --> 15:41.516
You're a very special person, Kathy.

15:43.226 --> 15:45.479
- Maybe when all of this is over-
- Eric.

15:47.564 --> 15:49.900
I like you, I really do.

15:50.233 --> 15:53.445
But, you, my career,
it's all been kind of sudden.

15:54.780 --> 15:56.823
- You understand, right?
- No.

15:59.659 --> 16:03.914
But then what else is new? Come on.
Let's go down to the party.

16:07.584 --> 16:09.920
Kim, will you stop playing around
with those tapes...

16:10.003 --> 16:12.672
and tell us why you brought us here
at this ungodly hour?

16:12.756 --> 16:16.134
What's the point of being young,
famous, and immensely talented...

16:16.217 --> 16:18.386
if you can't sleep till 12:00 noon?

16:21.473 --> 16:23.808
Can he even hear us?

16:23.892 --> 16:25.852
I can hear you.

16:25.935 --> 16:28.772
Then what's this all about?

16:31.608 --> 16:32.776
What is that?

16:32.859 --> 16:36.446
A take from Farewell to the Master.
It's one they decided not to use.

16:36.529 --> 16:40.325
Eric asked me to come down here
and remix it for some reason...

16:40.408 --> 16:43.453
and I got to fooling around a little,
and I came up with this.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.371
I repeat. What is it?

16:45.622 --> 16:48.291
It's a 33 cut played at about half speed.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.043
So?

16:50.126 --> 16:51.711
So listen.

16:52.587 --> 16:54.088
Someone get me out, it's so cold...

16:54.172 --> 16:56.299
Now, I'll slow it down even more.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.766
Someone take the pennies
off of Billy's eyes.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.017
That's Billy's voice.

17:06.142 --> 17:08.310
Someone pry the coffin lid loose.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.731
Someone get me out,
it's so cold and so damp.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.358
Can anybody hear me at all?

17:15.651 --> 17:20.323
That track was cut at so slow a speed
that when the record's played at 33 rpms...

17:20.406 --> 17:23.034
it sounds like so much background noise.

17:23.117 --> 17:25.411
When you slow it down, though,
you get that.

17:25.493 --> 17:28.039
Someone take the pennies
off ofBilly's eyes.

17:28.122 --> 17:30.583
Someone pry the coffin lid loose.

17:32.376 --> 17:34.962
Oh, no. I ain't going for this.

17:35.046 --> 17:38.174
I went for it with the Beatles
and Revolution 9...

17:38.257 --> 17:41.469
playing that backwards,
but I ain't gonna go for this.

17:41.635 --> 17:43.179
Shut up, Jerry.

17:43.637 --> 17:46.432
"Turn me on, dead man. "

17:48.225 --> 17:50.686
You think Billy recorded that
before he disappeared?

17:50.769 --> 17:54.315
He had to. He produced his own albums.
It's part of his contract.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.317
You think Billy is still alive?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.444
Yeah, and living with Paul McCartney?

17:58.527 --> 18:02.323
Jerry, knock it off! Suppose he knew
he was gonna disappear...

18:03.115 --> 18:05.576
maybe he planted those tracks as clues?

18:05.743 --> 18:08.162
Maybe it was just
a twisted publicity gimmick.

18:08.245 --> 18:11.457
You know Billy would do anything
for a couple of lines in the paper.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.625
Maybe. It's worth checking out,
either way.

18:13.709 --> 18:16.837
Keep playing with the dials,
see what other goodies you come up with.

18:16.920 --> 18:20.674
Wait a minute. How come we become
the Columbos all of a sudden?

18:20.758 --> 18:23.343
Billy Dero is this company's biggest asset.

18:23.635 --> 18:26.555
Without him,
Phoenix could go down the tubes.

18:26.680 --> 18:30.517
And without Phoenix,
the three of us could go down the tubes.

18:30.601 --> 18:35.189
Don't forget how Eric picked us up
when no one would take a chance on us.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.908
Yes, I've got the money.

18:47.743 --> 18:50.495
Whatever you do,
don't burn another song!

18:53.999 --> 18:55.709
Right, 5:00 p. m.

18:56.168 --> 18:59.838
Mulholland and Sepulveda,
in Sherman Oaks. I know the area.

19:02.215 --> 19:05.677
I'll be there. Yes, alone!

19:09.139 --> 19:10.223
Fine.

19:11.766 --> 19:13.018
Good-bye.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.855
All set. He's got the money.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.523
I hope we can believe him.

19:18.607 --> 19:21.568
You can. I broke into his office.

19:22.193 --> 19:24.237
I made a copy of the bank draft.

19:24.321 --> 19:26.031
He did it, all right.

19:26.406 --> 19:30.744
He got a personal loan with
his majority share of Phoenix as collateral.

19:32.078 --> 19:34.873
You show quite a talent for theft,
Ms. Gordon.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.876
You might consider taking it up
as a profession.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.962
All we want is our 10%
for stealing that tape.

19:41.045 --> 19:43.423
Five percent was the agreed-upon price.

19:43.631 --> 19:45.008
She's right, Barbi.

19:45.091 --> 19:49.095
I decided 5% wasn't
adequate compensation...

19:49.179 --> 19:51.556
for the risks we're taking.

19:51.639 --> 19:53.433
Ten percent is more like it.

19:53.516 --> 19:57.604
I'd certainly hate to discourage the
potential you show, Ms. Gordon.

19:58.271 --> 20:01.274
Seven percent. Take it or leave it.

20:07.655 --> 20:09.449
We'll take it.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.833
An album cover. So what?

20:18.916 --> 20:21.836
So, look at the way
Billy's finger is pointing.

20:22.378 --> 20:24.797
He's pointing to Santa Claus. So what?

20:25.756 --> 20:28.217
Look what's written
above the Santa Claus.

20:28.551 --> 20:31.304
"What's My Monicker, Veronica "?

20:31.637 --> 20:33.973
For crying out loud. What's a "monicker"?

20:34.599 --> 20:37.476
"Monicker" is '40s street slang for "name. "

20:38.769 --> 20:41.856
- Come on, guys. You still don't get it?
- Get what?

20:45.109 --> 20:47.361
Santa, Monicker.

20:48.237 --> 20:51.824
Oh, that's terrible.
I mean, that is really terrible.

20:51.907 --> 20:54.452
Billy had a cabin in the Santa Monica
mountains, didn't he?

20:54.535 --> 20:58.122
Yeah, years ago! Nobody's been there
in so long, it's boarded up.

20:58.289 --> 21:01.667
Yeah, but what better place to, like,
"disappear" for a few weeks?

21:06.422 --> 21:07.548
Eric. I...

21:18.142 --> 21:20.269
That's for the blackmailer, isn't it?

21:22.021 --> 21:23.939
I don't have any choice, Kathy.

21:26.483 --> 21:28.694
- I wish I did.
- Eric.

21:32.990 --> 21:35.033
I didn't have any choice either.

21:43.208 --> 21:45.043
Right, 5:00 p. m.

21:45.127 --> 21:48.714
Mulholland and Sepulveda,
in Sherman Oaks. I know the area.

22:02.227 --> 22:04.646
Hey, man, this place looks like a tomb.

22:05.188 --> 22:07.399
- Shall we take a look?
- All in favor?

22:07.774 --> 22:09.109
Aye.

22:50.942 --> 22:53.236
You scared me half to death.

22:54.237 --> 22:56.948
What are you all doing here, fellas?
Howdy to you.

22:57.740 --> 22:59.867
It's great to see you!

23:01.202 --> 23:02.996
Well, it's been great to see you.

23:07.417 --> 23:10.128
You little toad!
You've been hiding out here for six weeks?

23:10.211 --> 23:13.923
I was planning on coming
out of seclusion real soon, fellas.

23:14.465 --> 23:17.093
Like after your memorial album
sold triple platinum?

23:17.176 --> 23:20.012
Heck, I never could put anything
over on you guys, could I?

23:20.096 --> 23:21.264
You mean to tell me...

23:21.347 --> 23:23.724
you faked your own death
just to sell some albums?

23:23.808 --> 23:25.268
Think for a second, Jer.

23:25.351 --> 23:27.895
There's nothing quite so saleable
as a dead rock star.

23:27.979 --> 23:30.439
Little Billy here
would have cleaned up on royalties.

23:30.523 --> 23:32.066
He would've made millions off a lie!

23:32.149 --> 23:34.277
Now don't judge me too harshly, fellas.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.445
You and I know my career
was slipping a little.

23:36.529 --> 23:38.781
I figured being dead
would liven it up a little.

23:38.864 --> 23:41.284
What about those dumb clues
you put on your album...

23:41.367 --> 23:43.953
that caused us to come here
in the first place?

23:44.036 --> 23:47.790
I just wanted to create a little groundswell
of interest among the fans...

23:47.873 --> 23:50.960
so when I finally did come back,
it would be dramatic.

23:51.711 --> 23:54.630
If it worked for the Beatles,
it would probably work for me.

23:54.714 --> 23:56.298
I suppose you didn't give a thought...

23:56.382 --> 23:58.300
as to what your stunt might do
to Phoenix?

23:58.384 --> 24:01.137
Pushing a borderline company
into bankruptcy!

24:01.220 --> 24:02.388
I got news for you, Billy.

24:02.471 --> 24:04.807
Your resurrection is gonna occur
ahead of schedule.

24:04.890 --> 24:07.768
Just hold on a second, fellas.
Give me a couple of weeks.

24:07.852 --> 24:10.729
I mean, give them time
to release the album, for Pete's sake.

24:10.813 --> 24:12.147
No way, José.

24:31.834 --> 24:33.001
Billy Dero?

24:33.794 --> 24:35.504
It's a long story.

24:36.255 --> 24:37.339
Where's Eric?

24:37.422 --> 24:41.343
That's another long story.
I'll explain on the way to Sherman Oaks.

24:41.426 --> 24:43.720
You guys have got to help me.
We've got to get to Eric...

24:43.804 --> 24:47.182
before he bankrupts himself by paying
a ransom of $1 million...

24:47.933 --> 24:49.726
that he doesn't need to pay.

25:14.209 --> 25:16.044
Afternoon, Mr. Landau.

25:16.795 --> 25:19.881
I think we can dispose of this business
in a matter of minutes.

25:19.965 --> 25:22.509
Just a second.
How do I know that tape's the real thing?

25:22.592 --> 25:25.345
Those could be the greatest hits
of Connie Francis for all I know.

25:25.428 --> 25:27.389
I was prepared for that question.

25:27.472 --> 25:29.975
Let me hook up the recorder.

25:44.864 --> 25:47.033
- Hey, man.
- Billy!

25:47.784 --> 25:49.285
I thought you were dead.

25:49.369 --> 25:51.996
I know, there's a lot I have to explain.

25:52.455 --> 25:54.124
Come on. Let's go.

25:55.917 --> 25:58.253
Go! Move it!

26:19.524 --> 26:21.234
- It's Wonder Woman.
- She's flying.

28:13.303 --> 28:14.888
You're okay now.

28:15.514 --> 28:18.600
Yeah. What did that toad-burger do to me?

28:18.850 --> 28:19.893
Hey, Kim!

28:21.645 --> 28:23.855
Listen, I want you to stay put right here.

28:23.939 --> 28:26.316
Sure. Promise. Scout's honor.

28:30.737 --> 28:32.739
Hey, Kim, how're you doing?

28:33.365 --> 28:37.619
Man, that was either the bravest
or the dumbest thing I ever seen.

28:37.702 --> 28:39.704
I'm taking odds on dumb.

28:39.788 --> 28:41.831
You beautiful jerk! Are you okay?

28:41.915 --> 28:43.041
You tell me.

28:43.124 --> 28:44.793
What happened to Wonder Woman?

28:44.876 --> 28:47.754
I guess she left.
Low-profile kind of lady...

28:47.837 --> 28:51.716
- but she is definitely cool.
- Oh, hey, speaking of ladies...

28:52.300 --> 28:53.927
where's Kathy?

28:55.720 --> 28:56.846
Yeah.

28:57.388 --> 28:59.682
Last time I saw her
she was outside the van!

28:59.766 --> 29:01.643
You guys left her back there.

29:07.732 --> 29:08.858
Wonderful.

29:10.735 --> 29:12.654
Simply wonderful.

29:13.321 --> 29:15.531
Not only did you botch the pick-up...

29:15.615 --> 29:18.534
but now, with Billy Dero
miraculously alive once more...

29:18.618 --> 29:21.079
do you know how much this is worth?

29:21.621 --> 29:22.914
Nothing!

29:23.247 --> 29:26.292
All Landau has to do
is have Dero re-record it!

29:26.876 --> 29:30.296
We couldn't trade it in
for a crummy John Travolta poster!

29:30.379 --> 29:34.884
Not necessarily. There is one way
to restore the value of that tape.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.721
It was worth so much before
because it was a memorial album.

29:38.805 --> 29:39.931
Right?

29:40.014 --> 29:44.060
All we have to do is make it
a memorial album all over again.

29:44.143 --> 29:45.645
Wait a minute.

29:46.103 --> 29:48.272
What are you talking about?

29:50.566 --> 29:52.610
You're suggesting we kill him?

29:52.693 --> 29:55.112
Happens all the time
in this business, Jeffrey.

29:55.196 --> 29:58.574
- Your option just doesn't get picked up...
- I like it.

29:59.367 --> 30:01.619
It's simple, to the point.

30:01.702 --> 30:02.745
It may work.

30:02.828 --> 30:05.915
Are you joking?
We're talking about murder.

30:06.040 --> 30:09.460
Don't be a fool, Jeffrey.
We're in this too deep.

30:10.169 --> 30:12.087
- We have no alternative.
- No!

30:14.298 --> 30:16.467
Listen, there's got to be a better way!

30:16.550 --> 30:21.013
I mean, what's the sense in killing him
just so your tape will be worth something?

30:21.096 --> 30:25.226
Why hold the tape for ransom,
when you can hold Billy for ransom?

30:26.101 --> 30:29.563
That is an extraordinarily good idea, Jeff.

30:31.482 --> 30:33.400
With Billy and the tape in our possession...

30:33.484 --> 30:35.986
we'd have Phoenix
completely at our mercy.

30:36.070 --> 30:39.782
Yes. That's a very good idea.

30:40.783 --> 30:42.659
And since it was your concept...

30:42.743 --> 30:45.245
and since you two are the only ones...

30:45.329 --> 30:49.541
who can get close enough to Mr. Dero
to abduct him, the job is yours.

30:51.710 --> 30:53.128
Come on.

31:01.845 --> 31:05.599
The field office ran a check on the car
Kobler's man left behind...

31:05.682 --> 31:09.061
I'm afraid they came up
with a big, fat zero.

31:09.519 --> 31:12.814
The car was stolen out of a garage
in Van Nuys two weeks ago.

31:13.565 --> 31:16.985
That does it for us.
She's probably halfway to Mexico by now.

31:17.069 --> 31:20.405
I'm gonna stick around for a couple of days
to make sure.

31:20.489 --> 31:25.243
Anyway, I've another record to cut before
I can break my trial contract with Phoenix.

31:25.327 --> 31:27.871
Unless I care to blow my cover
by being sued.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.831
Your cover's still holding up well?

31:29.915 --> 31:31.833
Maybe a little too well.

31:32.250 --> 31:36.713
I think Eric Landau is developing
an unexpected interest in me.

31:37.505 --> 31:39.341
In Kathy Meadows, I should say.

31:40.467 --> 31:44.054
Come on, Diana. You've handled
spies, kidnappers, and assassins.

31:44.137 --> 31:47.098
One amorous record executive
shouldn't be too difficult.

31:47.182 --> 31:48.975
I don't know, Steve.

31:49.851 --> 31:52.604
When I leave,
I'm gonna have to tell him who I am.

31:52.687 --> 31:55.774
I'm afraid he's going to feel really used.
Manipulated.

31:56.858 --> 31:59.027
I wish I didn't have to hurt him that way.

31:59.110 --> 32:02.405
I'm afraid what you're talking about
comes with the territory, Diana.

32:02.489 --> 32:06.576
I know. Pretty lousy territory, isn't it?

32:06.868 --> 32:10.538
I suppose there are better ones.
Listen, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

32:11.206 --> 32:12.457
Right.

32:18.922 --> 32:21.382
Billy, I'm willing to forgive and forget.

32:21.466 --> 32:24.636
Sure, you tried to gyp the company
out of $500,000.

32:24.719 --> 32:27.138
- Oh, man.
- Look, you almost bankrupted us!

32:27.221 --> 32:28.723
Totally unintentional.

32:28.806 --> 32:32.727
What we gotta do now is how to reveal
your appearance to the public...

32:32.810 --> 32:35.897
so that we both don't get
get arrested for fraudulent advertising.

32:35.980 --> 32:39.525
I don't see that as any kind of problem.
All we have to do is market...

32:39.609 --> 32:42.862
the thing as a return appearance.
All we have to do is call it...

32:42.945 --> 32:45.573
Return of the Master.
I mean, hell, that's simple sales.

32:45.656 --> 32:49.911
How are we gonna reveal Return when
the disappearance was fake to begin with!

32:50.536 --> 32:54.874
No, what we gotta do is we gotta
go public with this whole sleazy story.

32:56.042 --> 32:59.503
Go public? You're gonna
tell the world about this?

32:59.587 --> 33:01.422
I'm gonna look like a fool!

33:01.505 --> 33:03.299
If it's any consolation to you, Billy...

33:03.382 --> 33:06.177
I'm not gonna come out
looking like Boy Wonder, myself.

33:06.260 --> 33:07.887
I want you to get into Studio B.

33:07.970 --> 33:10.222
I want you to re-cut
that album all over again.

33:10.306 --> 33:12.933
Antimatter is gonna be your engineers.

33:13.017 --> 33:14.852
You dig me, compadre?

33:17.772 --> 33:19.440
Yeah, I got you.

33:20.774 --> 33:22.109
You got it.

33:54.516 --> 33:57.728
They'll be recording in there.
We'll bring him down in 10 minutes.

33:57.811 --> 33:58.979
Right.

34:00.814 --> 34:02.232
Barbi, I'm scared.

34:02.316 --> 34:05.110
Will you stop sniveling! Here's your mask.

34:05.194 --> 34:06.778
You sure nobody's gonna get hurt?

34:06.862 --> 34:10.908
The feedback is just gonna distract them,
Jeffrey. No one's going to get killed.

34:10.991 --> 34:14.411
Have you got your earplugs?
Let's go, then.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.835
Do we have mice in the studio here?

35:05.545 --> 35:07.922
- I think it's feedback. Kim?
- Probably.

35:15.847 --> 35:19.559
It's coming through these speakers.
You're gonna have to turn it off in there.

35:19.642 --> 35:22.729
Would you see what that noise is
before it drives us all crazy?

35:22.812 --> 35:24.355
Right. You got it.

35:32.572 --> 35:33.698
Stop this!

35:45.793 --> 35:48.254
What're you doing? What's going on here?

35:55.887 --> 35:59.223
What are you doing? No!

35:59.390 --> 36:01.642
What's going on here?

37:04.288 --> 37:05.956
They've got Billy.

37:19.094 --> 37:20.470
Marty, watch out!

37:25.308 --> 37:26.977
Oh, no!

37:39.030 --> 37:43.201
It's a pleasure seeing you again, too.
Who was in the car with Billy?

37:43.285 --> 37:45.328
Jeff and Barbi Gordon.

37:46.454 --> 37:50.208
- Where were they taking him?
- Their house, Beverly Hills.

37:50.333 --> 37:54.671
Good. One more thing.
Where's your boss? Ms. Kobler?

37:57.007 --> 38:01.428
An estate, in Malibu,
1619 Pacific Coast Highway.

38:04.222 --> 38:08.393
I want you guys to call the police and
have them take care of our friend here...

38:08.476 --> 38:11.646
and then have them pick up
a woman named Kobler...

38:11.729 --> 38:13.898
at 1619 Pacific Coast Highway.

38:13.982 --> 38:16.443
- I'm going after Jeff and Barbi.
- Jeff and Barbi!

38:16.526 --> 38:18.528
It was the Bobbsey twins
that did this to us?

38:39.465 --> 38:43.136
If you want money? I've got money.
Fame? I got that, too.

38:43.219 --> 38:45.722
There must be a way
we can figure out to share this.

38:45.805 --> 38:49.392
Isn't anyone interested in show business?
Come on, guys, give me a break.

38:49.475 --> 38:51.102
Don't kill me now.

38:55.439 --> 38:57.358
Now, stay calm, Barbi.

38:57.733 --> 39:00.903
Wonder Woman's undoubtedly
coming after me first.

39:00.987 --> 39:03.739
And we'll be out of here
in three minutes flat.

39:03.823 --> 39:07.535
No. Now, stay where you are.
We'll come by, pick you up.

39:08.077 --> 39:10.913
We'll all be on the plane to Rio
by midnight.

39:12.415 --> 39:16.502
She won't. It's me she's after. Trust me.

39:26.554 --> 39:29.390
You sure Wonder Woman
is on her way here?

39:31.934 --> 39:35.145
Of course not.
She's on her way to rescue Billy Dero.

39:35.229 --> 39:39.483
From what I've heard about her,
she values human life above all else.

39:39.608 --> 39:43.320
By the time she captures our erstwhile
conspirators, we're gonna be long gone.

39:43.404 --> 39:45.614
Look, I want this place torn up, fast.

39:45.698 --> 39:48.450
We're gonna make
a small bonfire here, shortly.

40:20.816 --> 40:23.318
I locked him in the tool shed. What now?

40:23.402 --> 40:27.114
Kobler's picking us up
and getting us all out of this mess.

40:27.197 --> 40:30.826
If you hadn't insisted on kidnapping Billy,
this never would have happened!

40:30.909 --> 40:33.412
Only because it was either that or kill him.

40:33.495 --> 40:36.623
Never mind.
It'll all be over very shortly now.

41:27.966 --> 41:29.175
Freeze!

41:44.941 --> 41:46.317
Call the cops.

41:49.112 --> 41:50.196
Help!

41:58.746 --> 42:00.248
Somebody!

42:04.669 --> 42:06.462
I'm in here!

42:13.094 --> 42:16.222
Kobler lied! She's come for us first.

42:17.431 --> 42:19.725
Arnold! Herman! Get out here!

42:23.479 --> 42:24.730
Get her!

42:27.191 --> 42:30.069
You guys really don't want to try that,
do you?

42:47.253 --> 42:50.130
Those weak-kneed excuses
for bodyguards!

42:50.214 --> 42:53.300
- What are they doing?
- Treading water, mostly.

42:53.425 --> 42:56.095
We better get out of town. Let's go.

43:07.356 --> 43:09.149
Is anybody out there?

43:12.486 --> 43:14.446
Help me!

43:24.456 --> 43:27.584
Hello, Billy. Bye, Billy.

43:27.876 --> 43:32.798
Hey! Don't I get a kiss?
A silver bullet or something?

43:48.063 --> 43:50.357
I'm going after Jeff and Barbi.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.150
Hey! Wait a second!

44:17.509 --> 44:22.388
Kathy, Jim tells me you're planning
to leave after you cut this next song.

44:23.765 --> 44:25.266
That's right.

44:25.391 --> 44:28.686
You see, my trial contract
will be over then and I have to leave.

44:28.770 --> 44:30.438
And go back East.

44:30.522 --> 44:34.025
But why? You've got a great future
in this business.

44:34.108 --> 44:36.402
Now that this extortion thing is over...

44:37.904 --> 44:41.449
I was kind of hoping that
maybe we could see more of each other.

44:48.206 --> 44:50.083
I've got something to tell you.

44:50.166 --> 44:53.294
My name is not Kathy Meadows.
It's Diana Prince.

44:54.003 --> 44:56.339
I'm an agent with the IADC.

44:57.340 --> 44:59.759
I came here and posed as a singer...

45:00.051 --> 45:02.512
to find and capture Adelle Kobler.

45:03.262 --> 45:07.141
And now that I've accomplished that,
I have to leave.

45:09.018 --> 45:10.937
Why didn't you tell me?

45:11.187 --> 45:15.024
I was undercover. I couldn't tell you.
I couldn't tell anybody.

45:16.025 --> 45:19.111
Right, so I was just
part of your assignment.

45:19.904 --> 45:21.906
That's all I was to you.

45:24.867 --> 45:28.204
If I try to tell you differently,
you won't believe me.

45:28.287 --> 45:29.747
That's right, lady.

45:53.395 --> 45:54.897
Ready, Kathy?

45:58.150 --> 45:59.234
Sure.

48:23.711 --> 48:25.254
