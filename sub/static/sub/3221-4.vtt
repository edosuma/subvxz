WEBVTT

00:03.397 --> 00:05.555
- Name's Crowley.
- You're Crowley.

00:06.233 --> 00:08.558
So you have heard of me.
I can give you anything.

00:08.736 --> 00:10.859
- All I need is-
- My soul.

00:11.030 --> 00:13.153
- You sold your soul?
- More like pawned it.

00:13.324 --> 00:15.281
- I intend to give it back.
- Give it back.

00:15.451 --> 00:16.993
- I can't.
- Can't or won't?

00:17.161 --> 00:18.904
I won't, all right? It's insurance.

00:19.205 --> 00:21.078
Rufus Turner is a hunter.

00:21.248 --> 00:22.624
- Old friends?
- Friend?

00:22.791 --> 00:24.950
He's not the Christmas-card type.

00:25.127 --> 00:28.081
Sheriff Jody Mills.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

00:28.255 --> 00:30.082
- Agent Willis speaking.
- Bobby?

00:30.257 --> 00:31.835
- Oh.
- So you know Bobby Singer.

00:32.009 --> 00:35.176
I thought the sheriff hated you.
She did till five days ago.

00:35.346 --> 00:36.804
What happened five days ago?

00:36.972 --> 00:38.716
The dead started rising all over town.

00:40.351 --> 00:43.352
- Bobby, you just gonna sit there?
- No, I'm gonna river dance.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.597
Really wasted that crossroads deal.

00:51.237 --> 00:54.403
- Son of a bitch.
- Hello. King of the crossroads.

00:54.573 --> 00:56.945
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

00:57.117 --> 00:59.276
There's been a few times
you got me wondering.

00:59.453 --> 01:01.161
Something's different with you.

01:01.330 --> 01:03.488
- I'm okay.
- You went to hell, Sam.

01:08.128 --> 01:10.750
<i>Yesterday, this shoreline was pounded...</i>

01:10.923 --> 01:15.300
<i>by winds up to 150 miles per hour.</i>

01:15.469 --> 01:17.841
<i>But today,
well, there's not a cloud in sight.</i>

01:18.013 --> 01:21.963
<i>Hurricane Tiffany has broken up
over the Gulf and...</i>

01:39.702 --> 01:42.275
- Been making merry, have we?
- Bite me.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.822
If that's your thing.

01:49.879 --> 01:52.630
That swan dive of Sam's
was a thing of beauty.

01:53.549 --> 01:57.084
Tens all the way around,
standing O from the Romanian judge.

01:57.595 --> 02:01.260
You should be proud, Bobby.
As deaths go, wasn't too shabby.

02:02.057 --> 02:03.137
Cheer up, mate.

02:03.309 --> 02:05.597
We just saved the sodding world
together.

02:05.769 --> 02:08.142
Me, I've been celebrating.

02:08.564 --> 02:11.600
- Hate to see what you call celebrating.
- Yes, you would.

02:12.485 --> 02:14.773
- Drink?
- No.

02:16.405 --> 02:17.947
Let me get this straight.

02:18.115 --> 02:20.902
We saved the sodding world together...

02:21.076 --> 02:23.402
and you're too good to drink with me?

02:23.579 --> 02:24.694
Obviously.

02:25.247 --> 02:27.121
And I doubt that you have my brand.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.367
What's your poison, Your Highness?

02:29.543 --> 02:34.501
Craig, aged 30 years at least.
Been drinking it since grade school.

02:34.673 --> 02:41.720
Well, I got old rotgut, aged six days.

02:42.515 --> 02:45.136
Swill like that is gonna burn a hole
in your soul.

02:45.309 --> 02:47.218
Oh, sorry. My soul.

02:47.853 --> 02:51.139
But that's why you called?
Our little deal?

02:51.315 --> 02:56.855
Yeah, well, it's about time
you hold up your end and give it back.

02:57.780 --> 03:01.694
- Give it back?
- Our deal was we ice Lucifer...

03:01.867 --> 03:02.898
you rip up the lease.

03:03.077 --> 03:04.405
Oh.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.997
- You didn't read your contract?
- The hell you talking about, contract?

03:12.294 --> 03:16.339
Paragraph 18, subsection B,
which is on your naughty bits.

03:16.507 --> 03:19.674
I only have to make best efforts
to give you back your soul.

03:20.719 --> 03:21.799
Meaning what?

03:22.471 --> 03:26.136
Meaning I'd like to...

03:27.643 --> 03:30.015
- but I can't.
- You lying sack of-

03:30.187 --> 03:32.394
Ten years...

03:33.399 --> 03:34.478
you come to Daddy.

03:34.984 --> 03:37.819
Till then, I suggest
you start drinking the good stuff.

03:37.987 --> 03:40.359
I figured you'd say that.

03:40.531 --> 03:43.366
So you can rot here
till you change your mind.

03:43.534 --> 03:45.942
- Why? Because you asked nicely?
- No.

03:46.912 --> 03:50.281
<i>Because I'm going Dateline
on your ass.</i>

03:52.293 --> 03:53.703
I hope that's paint.

03:55.296 --> 03:56.576
Really?

03:56.755 --> 03:59.792
What am I going to do?

04:04.388 --> 04:07.057
Doggie breath. Bracing, isn't it?

04:09.143 --> 04:10.934
Ball's in your court, Robert.

04:11.103 --> 04:12.645
Ten years of living.

04:13.022 --> 04:14.564
Or ten years as Alpo.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.951
- This ain't over.
- I wouldn't have it any other way.

04:39.089 --> 04:40.999
Happy hunting.

05:13.374 --> 05:14.998
No EMF.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.543
You find anything in there?

05:16.710 --> 05:19.380
Yeah. I've got some kind of a claw.

05:20.005 --> 05:22.496
What in the hell has a claw like that?

05:22.675 --> 05:24.418
That's a good question.

05:34.395 --> 05:35.937
Maybe he's in the can.

05:43.487 --> 05:45.694
- Yeah?
- What happened? Fall and can't get up?

05:45.865 --> 05:47.323
Hilarious. What's up?

05:47.491 --> 05:50.611
We're in Wisconsin.
Six bodies, chests cracked wide open.

05:50.786 --> 05:52.530
No EMF, no sulfur, no hex bags.

05:52.705 --> 05:54.947
<i>We did find this, though. Hang on.</i>

05:58.210 --> 05:59.241
Check your Wang.

06:03.382 --> 06:04.461
That's a new one.

06:04.633 --> 06:06.128
Yeah, we need an ID, ASAP.

06:06.302 --> 06:09.137
<i>Thing's on a rampage.
Call as soon as you dig something up.</i>

06:09.305 --> 06:10.680
Dean, I'm a little busy.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.054
Kick Bo Derek out of your bathtub,
we got a case.

06:13.225 --> 06:15.099
I'll call you back.

06:21.484 --> 06:22.515
Balls.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.922
Balls.

06:54.558 --> 06:55.721
Come on.

06:56.477 --> 06:57.639
Come on.

07:00.731 --> 07:02.724
Balls.

07:39.311 --> 07:40.889
You're hunting a lamia.

07:41.647 --> 07:43.640
<i>Come again? It's a monster.</i>

07:43.816 --> 07:45.855
Juices hearts, chugs the blood.

07:46.026 --> 07:48.517
Never heard of one popping up
outside Greece, though.

07:48.696 --> 07:52.231
It looks like this freak is immigrating.
Snacking on cheeseheads.

07:52.408 --> 07:54.863
<i>- How do we gank it?
- Aah.</i>

07:55.035 --> 07:56.150
There's a couple of ways.

07:56.328 --> 07:59.614
Easiest is a silver knife blessed...

07:59.790 --> 08:01.368
<i>- by a padre.
- Gotcha.</i>

08:05.629 --> 08:07.539
You're welcome.

08:09.758 --> 08:13.839
Hey, I'm still here!

08:14.680 --> 08:16.222
Hey there, cranky.

08:16.515 --> 08:19.137
You were gone so long,
I just assumed alcoholic coma.

08:21.770 --> 08:23.562
- Where were we?
- Your soul.

08:23.731 --> 08:25.723
Right. Talk.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.901
Look at you, all in a rush.

08:29.361 --> 08:33.027
Foreplay gets you more play.

08:33.198 --> 08:34.859
I want Crowley's name.

08:35.534 --> 08:38.619
His real name,
back when he was flesh and blood.

08:38.787 --> 08:41.076
Does tying demons up
make you feel better...

08:41.248 --> 08:43.323
about that time you killed your wife?

08:53.761 --> 08:55.635
- What's that?
- You don't recognize them?

08:55.804 --> 08:58.093
They're yours.

09:18.285 --> 09:20.029
It won't work. It's a myth.

09:20.204 --> 09:23.158
Then you got nothing to worry about.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.203
I can't. Aah!

09:31.799 --> 09:35.002
- You don't know what he'll do to me.
- Right now you worry about me.

09:35.177 --> 09:37.004
You don't get it. He's the king-

09:39.348 --> 09:41.921
King of the crossroads,
I've heard the speech.

09:42.101 --> 09:43.560
No.

09:43.727 --> 09:45.637
King of hell.

09:54.196 --> 09:56.023
You gonna get that or what?

10:10.588 --> 10:11.868
Marcy. Bobby Singer...

10:12.256 --> 10:14.877
- how long have we been neighbors?
- Six months?

10:15.050 --> 10:18.799
Well, don't you think it's time
you welcomed me to the neighborhood?

10:19.471 --> 10:22.259
My famous ginger peach cobbler.

10:22.433 --> 10:25.350
Take a whiff. Seriously. I'm a genius.

10:28.147 --> 10:30.720
Help me! Somebody help me!

10:30.900 --> 10:35.229
Um, it's some stupid horror flick.
It's a guilty pleasure.

10:35.404 --> 10:38.607
<i>Oh, I love scary movies.
Hey, have you seen Drag Me To Hell?</i>

10:40.576 --> 10:43.945
- Trying to avoid it.
- But it's fantastic.

10:44.205 --> 10:47.040
Saturday, 7:00, my house.

10:47.208 --> 10:51.040
I'll fix you dinner, and I'll whip up
a batch of my white chocolate popcorn...

10:51.212 --> 10:53.833
and we'll watch it. Deal?

10:54.340 --> 10:57.424
That sounds super, Marcy, but, uh...

10:58.594 --> 11:00.966
Okay, no worries.

11:01.514 --> 11:02.628
Um, hey, one other thing.

11:03.265 --> 11:06.385
Uh, my woodchipper,
it's a piece of crap, you know?

11:06.560 --> 11:09.514
It just broke down on me,
and I hear that you're quite handy.

11:09.688 --> 11:13.603
Maybe you could come over
and take a look?

11:13.776 --> 11:15.519
You know, just whenever.

11:15.694 --> 11:17.438
I'll see what I can do.

11:17.905 --> 11:19.483
Okay.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.114
Okay.

11:26.664 --> 11:29.830
Okay, see you soon.

11:40.135 --> 11:43.302
Oh, she sounds nice.

11:43.472 --> 11:47.636
Are you gonna make sweet love to her
before you stab her to death, Bobby?

11:47.810 --> 11:49.352
That is your usual thing, right?

11:53.399 --> 11:54.679
I want Crowley's name. Now!

11:59.029 --> 12:01.983
- Crowley's name.
- Okay. Okay.

12:02.616 --> 12:05.107
MacLeod. Fergus MacLeod.

12:05.286 --> 12:08.037
Swear. We call him Lucky
the Leprechaun behind his back.

12:08.455 --> 12:11.243
MacLeod's Scottish, Einstein.

12:11.917 --> 12:15.286
You got what you want.
Now send me back-No.

12:17.298 --> 12:19.041
We had a deal.

12:19.466 --> 12:21.340
- Gave it my best effort.
- No.

12:37.652 --> 12:39.977
Yeah, Garth, what do you got?

12:40.363 --> 12:42.023
I never heard of a vamp doing that.

12:42.198 --> 12:45.401
Doesn't sound like our kind of thing.
Drop a dime to the FBI.

12:48.913 --> 12:51.036
Willis, FBI.

12:52.541 --> 12:55.412
No, Garth, not me "the FBI."

12:55.586 --> 12:57.378
The real FBI.

12:57.838 --> 12:58.870
How are you still alive?

13:00.967 --> 13:01.998
You got Castle.

13:03.803 --> 13:05.297
No. Yeah? Willis.

13:07.056 --> 13:09.262
Uh-huh. Of course she's one of ours.

13:09.433 --> 13:13.182
If she said she's gotta dig that grave up,
you better damn well let her.

13:18.276 --> 13:21.360
Oh, good. You're home. Listen.
You gotta help me bury a body.

13:24.699 --> 13:27.653
Why did you bring it here?
The law is on my tail.

13:27.827 --> 13:29.451
What was your guess?

13:29.620 --> 13:32.870
- What, what, what? They got lucky.
- Yeah, or you're getting slow.

13:33.040 --> 13:37.501
Oh, I'm getting slow. Yeah, says
Mr. Sits-on-His-Ass-All-Day-Taking-Calls.

13:41.924 --> 13:45.376
- Vamp, shifter, what?
- None of the above.

13:47.847 --> 13:50.468
Okami? Where did you shiv it?

13:50.641 --> 13:53.049
Get this, Billings.

13:53.227 --> 13:55.516
Only time I ever saw one of these
was in Japan.

13:55.688 --> 13:59.555
Duh. No one's ever seen one of these
except in Japan.

13:59.942 --> 14:04.900
For what it's worth, Sam and Dean
are tracking a lamia in Wisconsin.

14:05.072 --> 14:08.157
Get out.
I thought they never leave Greece.

14:08.743 --> 14:10.451
Monsters lately.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.197
Is it me, or is it weird?

14:12.371 --> 14:15.408
Yeah, well, it's definitely something.

14:16.792 --> 14:18.868
So you got a shovel?

14:26.260 --> 14:29.463
Man, I know what I want for Hanukkah.

14:35.561 --> 14:37.886
So the son of a bitch's name
is Fergus MacLeod?

14:38.064 --> 14:39.688
That's the son of a bitch's name.

14:39.857 --> 14:41.102
Where you gonna look?

14:41.692 --> 14:43.400
Scotland.

14:43.569 --> 14:46.938
Crowley let slip that he likes Craig.
It's, um-

14:47.114 --> 14:48.858
It's Scotch.

14:49.033 --> 14:52.532
Only made and sold in a tiny area
on the north tip of Caithness County.

14:52.703 --> 14:56.571
It's peaty and sharp with a long finish
of citrus and tobacco notes.

14:59.710 --> 15:02.545
What? What am I, a heathen?
I know what Craig is.

15:05.049 --> 15:09.877
Well, I got a hunch
that that's where Crowley lived and died.

15:10.054 --> 15:11.252
Back when he was a human.

15:11.430 --> 15:15.345
Few hundred years before he got the big
squeeze in hell and came out a demon.

15:16.602 --> 15:19.307
You know, I got contacts over there.

15:20.564 --> 15:22.723
I can make a few calls.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.976
I ain't asking for no help.

15:25.152 --> 15:28.023
I'm not asking for your permission.

15:40.376 --> 15:43.128
- Another way to kill a lamia?
- What happened to the knife...

15:43.296 --> 15:44.956
<i>blessed by a priest?</i>

15:45.131 --> 15:47.337
It didn't pan out. What's Plan B?

15:47.508 --> 15:50.295
- Grr.
- Unh. Dean. Aah!

15:51.846 --> 15:53.838
Police.
Come on, Bobby, get the lead out.

15:54.015 --> 15:55.758
- Where are you?
- Church. A rectory.

15:55.933 --> 15:58.970
Is there a kitchen?
Find salt and rosemary.

16:00.354 --> 16:02.098
Open up, Singer.

16:02.898 --> 16:06.350
Mr. Singer? I'm Agent Adams,
I believe you know Sheriff Mills.

16:09.697 --> 16:11.072
My Mom. Just a sec.

16:11.907 --> 16:13.865
- Rosemary. I got it.
- Great, great.

16:14.035 --> 16:15.743
Now, blend the herbs...

16:16.037 --> 16:17.780
<i>and sauté over a high heat.</i>

16:18.164 --> 16:19.243
Cook well.

16:25.755 --> 16:27.249
Sammy. Fire in the hole.

16:30.593 --> 16:33.796
Okay, great. Great.
Enjoy the roast, Mom.

16:33.971 --> 16:35.134
Have you seen this man?

16:35.306 --> 16:39.849
Rufus Turner, a. k.a. Luther Vandross,
a. k.a. Ruben Studdard?

16:40.269 --> 16:42.226
No. Never seen that dick.

16:42.730 --> 16:45.019
- How do you know he's a dick?
- Lucky guess.

16:45.191 --> 16:47.896
Funny, because I got a couple guys
working the highway...

16:48.069 --> 16:50.108
say they saw him here.
Carrying a body.

16:50.279 --> 16:53.233
Well, that's ridiculous.
Look, it's a work day, I gotta-

16:53.407 --> 16:55.281
We just wanna take a look around.

16:58.496 --> 17:00.038
You got a warrant, sonny?

17:00.206 --> 17:03.456
Well, do I need one, sir?

17:05.627 --> 17:08.333
Okay, fellas, put the rulers away,
zip up.

17:08.506 --> 17:12.800
Look, Bobby here's kind of a crank.

17:12.969 --> 17:15.804
He ain't what you'd call a fan
of Big Brother. Me and him-

17:15.972 --> 17:18.593
- How long I been arresting you, 10 years?
Thereabouts.

17:18.766 --> 17:19.964
Yeah. We got a history.

17:20.142 --> 17:23.346
So, what do you say you just let me
scope the place out?

17:23.521 --> 17:25.395
Is that okay?
You can just wait outside.

17:28.818 --> 17:31.190
Five minutes. Great.

17:37.451 --> 17:40.655
- Why send him outside?
- I didn't think you'd want him in here.

17:40.830 --> 17:43.072
- I don't. Got a body in basement.
- My point.

17:43.249 --> 17:45.325
Yeah, but I've got another body
buried in the yard.

17:46.711 --> 17:47.742
Damn it.

17:51.799 --> 17:54.551
- He's not there.
- Balls.

17:57.346 --> 18:00.964
Mr. Singer, come with me, please.

18:17.992 --> 18:20.234
You mind explaining this?

18:20.453 --> 18:23.786
What, you've never had a septic tank
explode on you?

18:24.165 --> 18:27.664
I got it pretty well cleaned up,
but watch where you step.

18:30.379 --> 18:33.665
<i>Get back here.
Get backl'm two states over, Bobby.</i>

18:33.841 --> 18:36.462
- The okami ain't dead.
- Of course it is.

18:36.761 --> 18:39.382
<i>Did you use a bamboo dagger?
Yeah.</i>

18:39.555 --> 18:42.260
- Blessed by a Shinto priest?
- I'm not an imbecile, Bobby.

18:42.433 --> 18:45.434
- Did you stab it seven times?
- Five times.

18:46.395 --> 18:47.593
It's seven.

18:48.314 --> 18:49.808
No, I'm pretty sure it's five.

18:49.982 --> 18:51.524
Well, clearly it's seven times.

18:51.692 --> 18:53.352
<i>The damn hole is empty.</i>

18:53.736 --> 18:55.278
What was it feeding on?

18:55.446 --> 18:57.071
Single white females.

18:57.239 --> 18:59.113
<i>While they slept.</i>

19:29.230 --> 19:30.558
- Bobby?
- Where's your bedroom?

19:41.284 --> 19:43.656
Bobby,
I am trying to keep my cool here...

19:43.828 --> 19:46.579
but what are you doing in my house
with a shotgun?

19:46.747 --> 19:49.618
Have you seen anything weird?

19:49.792 --> 19:52.413
You mean, besides you?

20:30.708 --> 20:33.875
Bobby! No! Look out!

20:54.774 --> 20:56.600
I, uh...

20:57.318 --> 20:59.275
I thought your chipper was broke.

21:03.032 --> 21:06.318
I just said that to get you over here.

21:08.996 --> 21:10.325
Oh.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.582
Well...

21:13.125 --> 21:16.708
I guess I could come over
for dinner some night.

21:16.879 --> 21:17.958
Might be fun.

21:18.965 --> 21:21.123
I don't think so.

21:24.887 --> 21:27.093
Story of my life.

21:29.684 --> 21:31.475
<i>You're still alive, huh?</i>

21:31.644 --> 21:32.759
Don't act so surprised.

21:32.937 --> 21:35.393
<i>How about Godzilla?
Put her down.</i>

21:35.565 --> 21:37.641
You just happened to have
a bamboo dagger...

21:37.817 --> 21:40.522
<i>- blessed by a Shinto priest around?
- Woodchipper.</i>

21:40.695 --> 21:42.273
Oh, okey-dokey, woodchipper.

21:42.447 --> 21:45.863
That pretty much trumps everything.

21:47.410 --> 21:49.617
Listen, Bobby, uh...

21:50.288 --> 21:51.996
thank you.

21:52.248 --> 21:54.656
- I screwed up.
- Forget it.

21:54.834 --> 21:57.206
I figure I still owe you
more than you owe me.

21:57.378 --> 22:00.166
Alrighty. Then add one more thing
to the list.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.249
I got a lead on your boy, Crowley...

22:03.468 --> 22:08.628
a. k.a. Fergus Rodric MacLeod...

22:08.807 --> 22:11.558
born in Canisbay, Scotland, 1661.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.517
I don't know
what that's gonna get me.

22:14.687 --> 22:18.021
All right, well,
then behind Door Number 2, Bob.

22:18.191 --> 22:19.270
Crowley had a son.

22:20.819 --> 22:21.898
Did he, now?

22:22.070 --> 22:25.154
Name of Gavin. Moved across
the pond after his parents bit it.

22:25.323 --> 22:28.988
Captained a trading ship that went down
in Massachusetts in 1723.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.532
Cousteau wannabes found the wreck
30 years ago.

22:31.704 --> 22:33.496
<i>They fish out his bones? No. No.</i>

22:33.665 --> 22:35.907
They did find his signet ring, though.

22:36.501 --> 22:38.577
It's part of
the Treasures from the Deep exhibit...

22:38.753 --> 22:40.331
at the maritime museum in Andover.

22:40.505 --> 22:41.916
I need that ring.

22:42.757 --> 22:45.213
Oh. Oh, are you, um-?

22:45.385 --> 22:46.927
Are you asking for my help, Bob?

22:49.013 --> 22:50.591
<i>Bobby?</i>

22:51.391 --> 22:53.763
I'm asking for a ring.

22:53.935 --> 22:56.604
And I'd appreciate...

22:57.772 --> 22:59.480
your help getting it.

22:59.649 --> 23:01.807
Ha, ha. I'm way ahead of you.

23:01.985 --> 23:05.105
I'm headed for Andover now.
Should be there around midnight.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.857
You're, um-

23:07.240 --> 23:09.398
You're thinking hostage exchange,
aren't you?

23:09.951 --> 23:12.822
<i>I mean, get the ring,
you can summon junior's ghost.</i>

23:12.996 --> 23:16.828
Get the ghost, you can swap Crowley
his son for your soul.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.581
Something like that.

23:20.336 --> 23:22.662
Let's hope that works out.

23:45.403 --> 23:47.028
Dean, you all right?

23:47.197 --> 23:50.032
Yeah. Yeah, the lamia grilled up fine.

23:51.117 --> 23:53.525
I sense a "but" coming on.

23:55.121 --> 23:56.450
It's Sam, Bobby.

23:59.709 --> 24:01.868
It's just he's different.

24:02.045 --> 24:07.086
You know, and I get it. You go through
something like that and you change.

24:09.219 --> 24:10.547
But something's not right to me.

24:12.347 --> 24:13.722
<i>Dean-I've got questions.</i>

24:13.890 --> 24:16.298
About that year,
you saw him and I didn't-

24:16.476 --> 24:17.970
- I got another call.
- You what?

24:18.144 --> 24:21.181
Just hang on.
I gotta take this, it's important.

24:21.898 --> 24:23.273
More important than Sam?

24:25.235 --> 24:27.274
- Bobby?
- Rufus?

24:28.655 --> 24:30.232
The good news is I snagged the ring.

24:30.406 --> 24:32.316
<i>Tell me that ain't-Yeah.</i>

24:32.492 --> 24:35.244
Three guesses and one of them,
it ain't the paramedics.

24:35.411 --> 24:37.784
- I gotta stash this ring.
- Don't swallow it.

24:38.623 --> 24:40.948
Right. I'm swallowing it, Bobby.

24:41.251 --> 24:42.828
Don't swallow it.

24:45.630 --> 24:46.958
Ah.

24:47.173 --> 24:49.130
<i>Damn it. Oh, hell.</i>

24:49.300 --> 24:51.376
<i>Hands where I can see them.</i>

24:51.553 --> 24:53.545
<i>Whoa, whoa.
Yo, that is unnecessary force.</i>

24:53.721 --> 24:54.753
<i>I know my rights.</i>

24:54.931 --> 24:56.046
<i>Move. Hey.</i>

24:59.227 --> 25:01.718
<i>You still there?
Bobby, what the hell?</i>

25:02.480 --> 25:04.140
I Sorry.

25:05.358 --> 25:08.692
You know, you are the one person
that I can talk to about this stuff.

25:08.862 --> 25:12.195
About Sam,
about leaving Lisa and Ben.

25:12.365 --> 25:14.856
<i>I mean, I don't even know
which way is up right now.</i>

25:17.912 --> 25:19.323
Bobby?

25:19.497 --> 25:20.576
<i>Hello?</i>

25:20.748 --> 25:23.322
I hear you, son.
It just ain't a good time.

25:23.501 --> 25:26.075
Yeah, okay.
You know what? Forget it.

25:26.254 --> 25:29.588
I mean, I'm baring my soul
like a frigging girl here...

25:29.757 --> 25:31.300
<i>and you got stuff to do.</i>

25:31.468 --> 25:33.341
<i>So that is-That's fine.</i>

25:34.387 --> 25:36.510
That's fine. Seriously, a little selfish.

25:37.223 --> 25:39.299
<i>It's not all about you.</i>

25:41.561 --> 25:42.806
Where's your brother?

25:44.230 --> 25:46.353
- Outside.
- Get him.

25:47.817 --> 25:49.940
<i>You're on speaker, Bobby.</i>

25:50.111 --> 25:52.068
Sam, Dean?

25:52.739 --> 25:55.693
<i>I love you like my own. I do.</i>

25:55.867 --> 25:57.147
<i>But sometimes-</i>

26:02.332 --> 26:05.867
Sometimes you two
are the whiniest...

26:06.044 --> 26:09.876
<i>most self-absorbed sons of bitches
I ever met.</i>

26:10.048 --> 26:12.717
I'm selfish? Me?

26:12.884 --> 26:14.295
I do everything for you.

26:14.636 --> 26:15.916
Everything.

26:16.095 --> 26:18.337
You need some lore scrounged up?

26:18.515 --> 26:20.922
<i>You need your asses pulled
out of the fire?</i>

26:21.100 --> 26:24.137
You need someone to bitch to
about each other?

26:24.437 --> 26:27.011
<i>You call me and I come through.</i>

26:27.190 --> 26:29.432
Every damn time.

26:29.609 --> 26:31.151
<i>And what do I get for it?</i>

26:31.319 --> 26:33.442
Jack with a side of squat.

26:33.613 --> 26:36.733
- Bobby-
- Do I sound like I'm done?

26:36.908 --> 26:40.111
<i>Now, look, I know you got issues.</i>

26:40.286 --> 26:43.287
God knows I know.

26:43.456 --> 26:45.579
But I got a news flash for you.

26:45.750 --> 26:48.585
You ain't the center of the universe.

26:48.753 --> 26:53.130
Now, it may have slipped your mind
that Crowley owns my soul...

26:53.299 --> 26:55.126
and the meter is running.

26:55.635 --> 27:01.720
And I will be damned
if I am gonna sit around and be damned!

27:01.891 --> 27:08.012
So how about you two sack up
and help me for once?

27:11.359 --> 27:13.601
Bobby, all you gotta do is ask.

27:16.072 --> 27:18.148
Anything you need, we're there.

27:35.091 --> 27:39.136
Got a call from Marcy Ward.
Seems she had a little home invasion.

27:39.304 --> 27:42.340
Told her I'd look into it.
Didn't bother filing a report.

27:42.515 --> 27:44.093
Thanks.

27:44.350 --> 27:45.679
Need a favor.

27:45.852 --> 27:49.055
Luther Vandross turn up?
Tell him I'm a fan.

27:49.230 --> 27:51.306
His real name is Rufus Turner.

27:51.483 --> 27:54.437
He's being held in Andover, Mass,
on a burglary charge.

27:55.278 --> 27:57.021
Need you to get him extradited here.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.821
- Extradited for what?
- Murder.

28:01.826 --> 28:03.700
You're not joking.

28:04.370 --> 28:07.206
Do you have any idea what it takes
to extradite a prisoner?

28:07.373 --> 28:10.043
I'd need a court order,
permission from the DA.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.579
I would have to call in every marker I got
and hand out a few to boot.

28:13.755 --> 28:15.831
So you're saying there's a chance?

28:16.007 --> 28:18.213
If by some miracle we can get him,
then what?

28:18.384 --> 28:21.551
Your pal's here on a murder charge.
How are you gonna get him out?

28:21.721 --> 28:22.919
Let me handle the B-side.

28:26.434 --> 28:28.226
I like you, Bobby.

28:28.394 --> 28:30.387
But this could nuke my career.

28:32.190 --> 28:34.099
Look, I've done a lot for this town.

28:34.275 --> 28:37.858
Some you know about,
some you don't.

28:38.029 --> 28:42.691
And I'm not real good at this whole
"asking for help" thing, but...

28:44.244 --> 28:45.821
I'm sorry, Bobby.

28:45.995 --> 28:47.276
I can't.

29:12.939 --> 29:14.564
Miss me?

29:17.735 --> 29:18.980
- How did you-?
- Don't ask.

29:20.822 --> 29:24.155
You got one hour and then I call
the feds and tell them he busted out.

29:25.326 --> 29:26.986
- Thanks.
- I lose my job over this...

29:27.162 --> 29:29.617
I am taking it out of your ass.

29:34.127 --> 29:37.163
Tell me the ring
is still in your stomach.

29:42.886 --> 29:45.341
I'll go boil some water.

29:46.806 --> 29:47.885
What?

30:41.903 --> 30:42.982
Gavin MacLeod?

30:43.696 --> 30:45.274
Is-?

30:45.615 --> 30:47.026
Is this hell?

30:47.200 --> 30:48.943
That's gonna depend on you.

30:51.037 --> 30:52.662
You Fergus MacLeod's boy?

30:55.166 --> 30:56.958
You and me...

30:57.127 --> 31:00.496
are gonna have a nice, long chat.

31:24.779 --> 31:27.270
Well, you look like hammered crap.

31:27.449 --> 31:29.073
And you're a vision, as always.

31:33.371 --> 31:35.328
Don't we both know
how this game ends?

31:35.749 --> 31:37.871
Really, you gotta know
when to fold them.

31:38.042 --> 31:41.246
Word on the street is that
ever since Lucifer went to the pokey...

31:41.421 --> 31:43.330
you're the big kahuna downstairs.

31:43.506 --> 31:46.377
- I see you've been reading the trades.
- Trouble in paradise?

31:46.551 --> 31:49.468
Mate, you have no idea.

31:51.181 --> 31:53.138
I thought...

31:54.350 --> 31:58.929
when I got the corner office,
I thought it was all gonna be rainbows...

31:59.105 --> 32:00.350
and two-headed puppies.

32:00.815 --> 32:04.647
But if I'm being honest, it's been hell.

32:04.986 --> 32:06.480
Thought that was the point.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.648
You know what the problem
with demons is?

32:11.826 --> 32:13.486
- They're demons?
- Exactly.

32:14.037 --> 32:16.610
Evil, lying prats,
the whole lot of them.

32:16.790 --> 32:18.118
And stupid.

32:18.666 --> 32:23.494
Try to show them a new way,
a better way, and what do you get?

32:23.671 --> 32:24.834
Bugger all.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.038
You know, there's days...

32:27.217 --> 32:32.258
that I think Lucifer's whole
"spike anything with black eyes" plan...

32:32.430 --> 32:34.470
wasn't half bad.

32:34.641 --> 32:35.886
Hmm.

32:36.559 --> 32:39.809
Feels good to get it off my chest.
We should make this a thing.

32:39.979 --> 32:41.972
Do I look like Dr. Phil to you?

32:42.941 --> 32:44.518
A little.

32:45.402 --> 32:49.233
Anyhoo,
obviously not here for a social call...

32:49.406 --> 32:50.900
so on with it.

32:51.074 --> 32:53.826
- I want-
- Ah. I'll save you the recap.

32:54.327 --> 32:57.032
In fact, I'll do the shorthand for you.

32:58.164 --> 33:00.572
"I want my soul back, idiot."

33:00.750 --> 33:01.995
"Afraid not."

33:02.168 --> 33:05.003
"But I'm surly and I got a beard. Give me."

33:05.171 --> 33:08.789
Blah, blah, blah,
homespun cornpone insult...

33:08.967 --> 33:11.209
witty retort from yours truly...

33:11.386 --> 33:14.422
and the bottom line is,
you get bupkis.

33:14.597 --> 33:18.180
- Are we done?
- Just getting started.

33:25.358 --> 33:27.018
Gavin?

33:27.569 --> 33:28.648
Is that you?

33:30.780 --> 33:32.654
It's been so long.

33:35.869 --> 33:37.327
I love you so-

33:41.374 --> 33:42.749
Sorry.

33:43.293 --> 33:45.166
Your soul for my boy. That's it, right?

33:45.628 --> 33:48.748
I gotta give you credit for thinking
outside the box on that one.

33:48.923 --> 33:51.675
But the problem is,
I loathe the little bastard.

33:51.843 --> 33:54.132
Wanna torture him?
Let me pull up a chair and watch.

33:54.304 --> 33:56.546
Hell, burn his bones,
send him down to me.

33:56.723 --> 33:59.428
We can have a family reunion.
That's right, son?

33:59.768 --> 34:01.725
You picked the wrong bargaining chip
this time.

34:02.270 --> 34:03.681
He ain't a chip.

34:05.231 --> 34:08.398
I was just using him
to dig up dirt on you.

34:09.444 --> 34:13.987
And since Gavin hates you
maybe even more than you hate him...

34:14.157 --> 34:17.656
he was more than happy to squawk.

34:18.786 --> 34:20.114
What did you tell him, son?

34:21.956 --> 34:23.996
Everything.

34:33.301 --> 34:34.545
I know it all now...

34:35.386 --> 34:36.844
Fergus.

34:37.806 --> 34:43.262
Now, you may be king
of the dirtbags here, but in life?

34:43.436 --> 34:48.063
You were nothing but a two-bit tailor
who sold his soul...

34:48.233 --> 34:51.103
in exchange for an extra 3 inches
below the belt.

34:51.277 --> 34:53.685
Just trying to hit double digits.

34:55.864 --> 34:58.950
So you got a glimpse
behind the curtain.

34:59.119 --> 35:04.409
- And?
- And now I know where you're planted.

35:11.089 --> 35:13.128
<i>Hi, Crowley.</i>

35:13.383 --> 35:16.966
Dean. It's been a long time.
We should get together.

35:17.137 --> 35:20.256
Sure.
We'll have to do that when I get back.

35:21.015 --> 35:22.759
<i>Back? Yeah.</i>

35:22.934 --> 35:25.259
Me and Sam,
we've gone international.

35:25.437 --> 35:28.224
In fact, we're in your neck
of the woods.

35:30.316 --> 35:33.935
- Did you really used to wear a skirt?
- A kilt.

35:34.112 --> 35:36.105
I had very athletic calves.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.031
<i>What's the game? Dominoes.</i>

35:39.200 --> 35:41.608
In fact, we just dug yours up.

35:43.872 --> 35:47.205
This is ridiculous. The whole
burning bones thing. It's a myth.

35:47.375 --> 35:50.127
I know an employee of yours
who'd disagree.

35:50.795 --> 35:53.084
What's that?
You don't recognize them?

35:53.256 --> 35:55.047
They're yours.

36:12.442 --> 36:14.684
- That's where she got to.
- You demons.

36:14.861 --> 36:17.352
You think you're something special.

36:17.906 --> 36:19.649
But you're just spirits.

36:19.824 --> 36:22.494
Twisted, perverted, evil spirits.

36:22.660 --> 36:28.746
But end of the day, you're nothing
but ghosts with an ego.

36:30.460 --> 36:34.327
We torch your bones,
you go up in flames.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.382
<i>You hear that, Crowley?</i>

36:38.051 --> 36:39.925
That's me flicking my Bic for you.

36:40.095 --> 36:43.345
Your bones for my soul.

36:43.515 --> 36:44.594
Going once.

36:50.688 --> 36:52.681
Going twice.

36:56.986 --> 36:58.896
Bollocks.

37:09.624 --> 37:13.538
You can go ahead
and leave in the part about my legs.

37:21.344 --> 37:23.716
Pleasure doing business with you.

37:24.389 --> 37:26.761
Now, if you don't mind.

37:32.856 --> 37:36.189
I believe those are mine.

37:36.943 --> 37:41.071
You know, now that I think about it,
maybe I'll just napalm your ass anyhow.

37:41.239 --> 37:46.150
Dean, he's a dick, but a deal's a deal.

37:46.870 --> 37:51.330
I don't need you to fight my battles
for me, moose. Get bent.

38:04.387 --> 38:05.762
Now, if you'll excuse me...

38:06.598 --> 38:08.306
I have a little hell to raise.

38:22.028 --> 38:24.649
<i>I appreciate you boys lending a hand.</i>

38:24.822 --> 38:26.815
Hey, any time we get to punk Crowley
works for us.

38:26.991 --> 38:28.106
<i>Yeah. Still...</i>

38:28.284 --> 38:31.238
<i>knowing how much you love flying
the friendly skies...</i>

38:31.412 --> 38:34.283
I guess a nine-hour plane trip
was no picnic.

38:34.457 --> 38:37.030
<i>You drink your way through it?
I was fine.</i>

38:37.210 --> 38:39.701
No. He white-knuckled his way
through four puke bags.

38:39.879 --> 38:41.457
Well, at least I was sober.

38:41.631 --> 38:44.383
Some nutjob decided to try something,
I was ready. I had a fork.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.129
Listen, um...

38:50.306 --> 38:52.595
about the things I said earlier.

38:52.767 --> 38:54.843
I was in a tough spot
and I guess I was-

38:55.019 --> 38:56.395
We take you for granted.

38:56.562 --> 38:58.769
You've been cleaning up our messes
for years.

38:58.940 --> 39:02.605
Without you, I don't wanna think about
where me and Sam would've ended up.

39:07.907 --> 39:10.576
Okay, then let's roll credits
on this chick flick.

39:10.910 --> 39:12.321
<i>You boys have a safe flight.</i>

39:12.495 --> 39:16.279
And try some of the local grub.
I hear it's exotic.

39:16.457 --> 39:19.292
Yeah, definitely, we are.
I hear they have an Olive Garden.

39:47.447 --> 39:48.692
Willis.

39:50.074 --> 39:51.189
Yeah, he is.

39:51.367 --> 39:53.526
One of our best agents, in fact.
