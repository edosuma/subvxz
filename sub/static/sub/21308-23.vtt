00:49.126 --> 00:50.546
Okay, I thought it was
a dream,

00:50.546 --> 00:52.376
but then, it was like,
"Oh, no, you ate

00:52.376 --> 00:54.706
all these goblin dogs,"
but it was not a dream.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.956
And then I brought
the goblin dogs truck
into my bedroom,

00:56.956 --> 00:59.286
and then, I crushed
my bed with it,

00:59.286 --> 01:01.086
and I had to turn my bed
back into a bed,

01:01.086 --> 01:03.416
and then I told
my mom about it,

01:03.416 --> 01:06.126
and then my mom
was, like, "That
shouldn't be happening."

01:06.126 --> 01:08.086
And I was like...
Jenna.

01:08.086 --> 01:09.666
Stop blowing in
Marco's hair.

01:09.666 --> 01:11.376
That was you?

01:11.376 --> 01:14.496
Sorry. Got a little bored.
No offense.

01:14.496 --> 01:17.956
Yeah, Star, can you just
get to the point, please?

01:20.206 --> 01:21.786
Okay, I'm sleep-portaling.

01:21.786 --> 01:25.746
In my sleep, every night,
I hear this sound.

01:25.746 --> 01:29.496
It's like...

01:29.496 --> 01:31.706
No, no, that's not it.

01:38.206 --> 01:40.746
Okay, Star, we get it.
Can we just get to
the point, please?

01:40.746 --> 01:42.746
I've been following
this sound

01:42.746 --> 01:45.286
to the same location
every night,

01:45.286 --> 01:46.836
but I never make it there,

01:46.836 --> 01:49.626
because I wake up,
and that's where you
come in, Janna.

01:49.626 --> 01:52.166
You've gotta hypnotize me
so I can stay asleep.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.166
What

01:54.166 --> 01:56.416
Star, shouldn't you leave
that to a trained professional?

01:56.416 --> 01:57.746
You doubt my skills?

01:57.746 --> 01:59.286
Yeah, actually,
I do.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.786
Chickenbutt.

02:00.786 --> 02:02.836
What the heck?
What happened?

02:02.836 --> 02:04.956
You guys, stop messing
around and get over here.

02:04.956 --> 02:06.836
Hey, check it out.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.836
I linked my compact phone
to my mirror,

02:08.836 --> 02:10.746
so you'll be able to see
whatever I see.

02:10.746 --> 02:13.126
Marco, you've got
the scissors.

02:13.126 --> 02:15.626
If anything goes wrong
out there, you come get me.

02:15.626 --> 02:16.996
You're my lifeline.

02:16.996 --> 02:18.706
What if you get lost,

02:18.706 --> 02:21.046
or go so far out
that we can't find you?

02:21.046 --> 02:24.206
Marco, we've dealt with
much worse stuff than this.

02:24.206 --> 02:26.666
Yeah, I guess.

02:29.496 --> 02:32.786
Okay, Star, take
a nice, deep breath.

02:35.876 --> 02:38.336
Now, focus on my watch.

02:38.336 --> 02:40.336
Hey, that's
my watch.

02:40.336 --> 02:42.916
- Dude, this is about Star.
Get over yourself.

02:42.916 --> 02:45.336
Keep your eyes
on the watch.

02:45.336 --> 02:47.336
You're feeling light
as a feather.

02:51.786 --> 02:54.496
And now we wait.

02:54.496 --> 02:57.416
So what exactly
does it look like
when she portals?

02:58.786 --> 03:00.336
Like that.

03:05.086 --> 03:08.376
We have lift-off.

03:31.046 --> 03:32.836
I'm here for you.

03:32.836 --> 03:34.836
Your lifeline.

03:36.496 --> 03:37.916
Uh, what's all that?

03:37.916 --> 03:40.706
Spiritual chromatograph,

03:40.706 --> 03:43.626
magic wave scope,
energy oscillotron,

03:43.626 --> 03:45.916
and a jigsaw puzzle
for when things get slow.

03:45.916 --> 03:49.876
But most importantly,
the map.

03:49.876 --> 03:51.706
Uh... uh...
where is she?!

03:51.706 --> 03:52.836
Here she is,
she's here.

03:52.836 --> 03:54.786
No, no, maybe
she's here.

03:54.786 --> 03:57.836
Or here. No.
Forget this.
I'm goin' in.

03:57.836 --> 04:00.496
Dude, relax. She's got
a long way to go.

04:02.126 --> 04:04.916
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

04:09.586 --> 04:11.206
So...

04:11.206 --> 04:12.916
Janna.

04:12.916 --> 04:15.546
Been a while since
we hung out one-on-one.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.956
- We never really--
- Chickenbutt.

04:36.376 --> 04:39.046
What the...

04:39.046 --> 04:40.706
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

04:40.706 --> 04:42.836
Huh... what?

04:42.836 --> 04:44.166
Janna?
What did you--

04:44.166 --> 04:45.786
Shut up and look.

04:47.786 --> 04:49.956
Wait. Where is that
on the map?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.956
I don't know.
She's off the map.

04:54.246 --> 04:57.416
Star.
No, no, no, no, no.

04:57.416 --> 04:58.836
Don't go in there.

05:13.416 --> 05:16.956
No! That's it.
I'm goin' in.

05:20.046 --> 05:21.996
What happened?
Where is she?

05:21.996 --> 05:23.876
I can't get to her
with the scissors

05:23.876 --> 05:25.786
if I don't know
where she is.

05:50.336 --> 05:52.746
You're here.

05:52.746 --> 05:55.456
I'm here.

05:58.086 --> 06:00.916
Stop it, stop it,
stop it.

06:02.546 --> 06:04.876
You're here!

06:04.876 --> 06:06.836
Okay, okay,
I'm here.

06:06.836 --> 06:09.746
But where is here?

06:09.746 --> 06:11.546
You don't know?

06:11.546 --> 06:14.086
You're in the realm
of magic.

06:20.126 --> 06:22.956
Wow!

06:22.956 --> 06:25.916
It's like Toffee
was never even here.

06:27.336 --> 06:29.546
It's been reborn-ded.

06:29.546 --> 06:31.126
That's not a word.

06:33.046 --> 06:34.286
That sound.

06:34.286 --> 06:36.916
The song of the firstborn.

06:36.916 --> 06:39.166
She's been calling to you.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.166
[high-pitched whine
continues]

06:49.496 --> 06:51.206
Okay, stop, please.

06:51.206 --> 06:53.376
And thank you.

06:53.376 --> 06:56.046
So who are you?

06:56.046 --> 06:58.956
Do you not recognize
your own creation?

07:03.336 --> 07:05.836
I made you?!

07:08.086 --> 07:09.956
I did good.

07:09.956 --> 07:11.496
So you're the one
that called me here?

07:11.496 --> 07:14.666
I can only call one
who wishes to be called.

07:14.666 --> 07:16.706
I don't understand.

07:16.706 --> 07:18.286
Why would I wish
to be called?

07:18.286 --> 07:20.706
I don't know.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.706
Perhaps the answer
rests here,

07:23.706 --> 07:26.046
in the realm of magic.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.126
Oh, I can't stay.

07:28.126 --> 07:30.586
- I have to go home.

07:36.376 --> 07:39.786
I guess I could stay.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.286
- Plug your nose.
- Oh, okay.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.626
- Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

07:48.626 --> 07:51.586
...try again.

07:51.586 --> 07:53.626
- Call Star.
- Calling Star.

07:53.626 --> 07:55.546
Aaaaahhh!

07:55.546 --> 07:58.336
What am I gonna do?

07:58.336 --> 08:00.166
Oh, what about Glossaryck?

08:00.166 --> 08:01.876
Maybe he can...

08:04.046 --> 08:06.246
You're a disgrace to magic.

08:06.246 --> 08:08.586
Magic.

08:09.836 --> 08:11.996
Oh, that's a bad idea.

08:11.996 --> 08:13.786
And that's coming from me.

08:17.666 --> 08:20.836
- Oh, you're gonna die!
- Ooh!

08:22.546 --> 08:23.546
Huh.

08:25.376 --> 08:27.126
Nothing happened.

08:27.126 --> 08:30.336
It's like our souls
are bonded--

08:41.246 --> 08:42.996
And there.

08:44.086 --> 08:45.586
Now it has your mole.

08:47.336 --> 08:50.086
Whoa. The All-Seeing Eye.

08:50.086 --> 08:52.496
Spying leads to crying?

08:52.496 --> 08:54.546
Just hold it up
so I can read it.

08:54.546 --> 08:56.126
Okay.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.666
Okay.

09:00.666 --> 09:04.286
I summon
the All-Seeing Eye

09:04.286 --> 09:06.046
to tear a hole
into the sky.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.626
Reveal to me
that which is hidden.

09:08.626 --> 09:11.126
Unveil to me
what is forbidden.

09:22.456 --> 09:24.206
Salmon.

09:24.206 --> 09:28.336
Stromboni.

09:28.336 --> 09:30.286
Strawberry.

09:30.286 --> 09:32.086
Sal... Sally!

09:32.086 --> 09:33.956
What are you doing?

09:33.956 --> 09:36.126
I can't remember
my name.

09:36.126 --> 09:38.916
Star!

09:38.916 --> 09:42.246
That's it.
That's my name. Star.

09:42.246 --> 09:44.416
Thanks, strange boy.

09:44.416 --> 09:46.706
Star, you have to come home.

09:46.706 --> 09:48.626
I am home.

09:48.626 --> 09:51.166
We've gotta get
her out of there.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.876
Just give me your hand.

09:55.336 --> 09:57.126
Marco.

09:58.706 --> 10:00.286
Marco?

10:00.286 --> 10:01.786
Marco!

10:07.746 --> 10:10.456
Wait.
Where are you going?

10:10.456 --> 10:11.746
Don't go.

10:11.746 --> 10:14.626
Sorry. I have to.

10:19.456 --> 10:22.046
Janna
Marco?

10:22.046 --> 10:24.046
Where are you?

10:24.046 --> 10:25.416
Janna! Marco!

10:25.416 --> 10:28.126
Over here.

10:29.876 --> 10:31.416
Are you okay?

10:31.416 --> 10:33.376
Better now without
that table on me.

10:33.376 --> 10:35.166
My wand.

10:35.166 --> 10:36.996
What did you do?

10:36.996 --> 10:39.336
Well, I was kind of
out of options.

10:39.336 --> 10:41.546
Oh, Marco,

10:41.546 --> 10:43.956
that was incredibly
stupid of you.

10:43.956 --> 10:45.706
That's a little mean.

10:45.706 --> 10:47.046
Thank you.

10:48.546 --> 10:50.706
Ew, gross.
Get a portal.

10:50.706 --> 10:51.996
Janna!

10:51.996 --> 10:55.376
- No rush.
- Gotcha.

10:55.376 --> 10:58.166
This is the coolest thing
that's ever happened to you.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.746
Agreed.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.706
Oh, check this out.

11:01.706 --> 11:04.206

11:04.206 --> 11:05.706
