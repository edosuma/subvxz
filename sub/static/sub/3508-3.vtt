"I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU EVEN

"SHUT UP, BOTH OF YOU.

YOU WANT ME TO LAND THIS ROLE?

OF COURSE WE DO. IT'S-
YEAH.

01:44.812 --> 01:47.930
LOOK, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THE LEAD IN A BROADWAY PLAY.

01:47.931 --> 01:49.613
THIS IS
A POTENTIAL GOLD MINE.

01:49.614 --> 01:51.528
IF IT'S A HIT, WHO KNOWS
HOW LONG IT COULD RUN?

01:51.529 --> 01:53.688
THEN I COULD TAKE IT ON THE
ROAD. YOU MEAN YOU'D LEAVE US?

01:53.689 --> 01:55.812
WELL, ONLY FOR NINE MONTHS
OF THE YEAR.

01:55.813 --> 02:00.314
OH, DON'T LOOK SO SAD. AND YOU,
DON'T LOOK SO HAPPY.

02:02.012 --> 02:03.015

WHOLE ENCHILADA.

02:08.984 --> 02:10.508
SORRY TO BAIL ON REHEARSAL.

OH, DON'T WORRY.
ALEXIS CAN READ BOTH PARTS.

02:12.125 --> 02:15.377
IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SHE MISSES
A MORNING OF SCHOOL, ISN'T IT?

02:15.378 --> 02:17.516
TAKE ME WITH YOU.
TO A CRIME SCENE?

02:17.517 --> 02:19.759
IT'D BE EDUCATIONAL. PLEASE.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.059
UH...

02:22.530 --> 02:25.673
FIND YOUR OWN HIDING PLACE.

02:28.580 --> 02:29.602
CAUCASIAN FEMALE.

02:29.603 --> 02:32.468
COUPLE OF SKINNY-DIPPERS FOUND HER
THIS MORNING. BET THAT KILLED THE MOOD.

02:32.469 --> 02:34.193
PURSE IS MISSING, NO I.D.
AND GET THIS-

02:34.194 --> 02:38.627
WE COULDN'T FIND HER SHOES. I'M GONNA GO
WITH "STILL WITH PRINCE CHARMING AT THE BALL."

02:38.628 --> 02:41.509
SHOULD WE LOOK FOR
A PUMPKIN AND SOME MICE?

02:41.510 --> 02:44.154
AH, I GUESS NOT.

02:44.155 --> 02:45.578
CANVASS THE BUILDINGS
SURROUNDING THE PLAZA

02:45.579 --> 02:47.853
AND GET UNIFORMS TO CHECK
TRASH CANS AND DUMPSTERS

02:47.854 --> 02:48.880
FOR HER PURSE.

02:48.890 --> 02:50.440
AYE-AYE.

02:52.842 --> 02:54.609
HI, LANIE.
HEY.

02:54.610 --> 02:56.180
CAUSE OF DEATH?
STABBING.

02:56.183 --> 02:57.885
THERE'S A FATAL WOUND
IN HER BACK.

02:57.897 --> 02:59.989
MAYBE A RIVALRY GONE WRONG?
MAYBE.

02:59.990 --> 03:01.051
WE GTA FIND OUT WHO SHE IS

03:01.052 --> 03:05.218
AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING HERE SO LATE,
THOUGH. WELL, SHE'S TALL, SHE'S GORGEOUS,

03:05.219 --> 03:07.162
10 POUNDS UNDERWEIGHT,
HER HAIR IS FRIED

03:07.163 --> 03:08.710
AND SHE'S WEARING TOO MUCH
EYE MAKEUP.

03:08.711 --> 03:10.941
SHE'S A MODEL, WHICH MEANS
SHE WAS PROBABLY

03:10.942 --> 03:13.601
AT A CLUB LAST NIGHT.
IT IS, AFTER ALL, FASHION WEEK-

03:13.602 --> 03:14.696
WHEN ALL THE HOTTEST WOMEN
IN THE WORLD

03:14.697 --> 03:17.477
DESCEND UPON THE HIPPEST
NIGHT SPOTS LIKE LOCUSTS.

03:17.478 --> 03:21.727
ONLY LOCUSTS EAT. CAN YOU
TELL ME WHO KILLED HER?

03:21.728 --> 03:26.339
THEN PIPE DOWN.
THIS WAS ON HER WRIST.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.942
SHE WAS AT A CLUB.

03:29.946 --> 03:31.526
THAT'S TEDDY FARROW'S LOGO.

03:31.527 --> 03:35.133
HE DESIGNS CLOTHES FOR WOMEN
- UPSCALE, EXPENSIVE. OH, MY CREDIT CARD AND I

03:35.134 --> 03:37.118
ARE PAINFULLY AWARE
OF TEDDY'S DESIGNS.

03:37.119 --> 03:39.498
I ALMOST ASKED FOR CUSTODY
OF THEM AFTER MY LAST DIVORCE.

03:39.499 --> 03:43.368
IS THERE A LABEL
IN HER DRESS?

03:43.369 --> 03:44.603
TEDDY FARROW COLLECTION.

03:44.604 --> 03:45.681
WELL, IF SHE IS
ONE OF HIS MODELS,

03:45.682 --> 03:49.952
MAYBE HE CAN IDENTIFY HER FOR US.
THANK YOU, LANIE. YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:49.953 --> 03:52.216
I CAN ALREADY SEE THE BLURB
Y NEXT BOOK JACKET.

03:52.217 --> 03:54.078
"IT'S FASHION WEEK
IN NEW YORK CITY,

03:54.079 --> 03:56.100
AND THE CLHES
ARE TO DIE FOR."

03:57.027 --> 03:57.592
fashion capital of the world

04:04.563 --> 04:06.018
FIVE MINUTES, PEOPLE.

04:06.443 --> 04:07.689
THAT'S JENNA.
JENNA McBOYD.

04:07.690 --> 04:10.283
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO WALK
FOR ME TODAY.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.504
MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED.

04:11.505 --> 04:14.033
SHE WAS STABBED SOME TIME THIS
MORNING. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.724
I MEAN, I SAW HER LAST NIGHT
AT MY PARTY.

04:16.725 --> 04:20.565
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL
AT THE PARTY? SHE WAS AGITATED,

04:20.565 --> 04:23.163
BUT THAT WASN'T SO UNUSUAL FOR
HER THESE DAYS. WHICH ONE? OKAY.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.842
ANY IDEA WHAT WAS WRONG?
YEAH, SHE WAS STRESSED OUT.

04:26.844 --> 04:29.072
HEY, NOT THE PINK SASH.
THE BLUE ONE.

04:29.073 --> 04:32.705
SORRY, SIR. LOOK, JENNA
WAS A SMALL-TOWN GIRL.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.797
I MEAN, STRAIGHT OFF THE BUS
FROM OHIO.

04:34.798 --> 04:37.355
YOU'RE SAYING SHE WAS AN
INNOCENT. SHE WAS A RISING STAR,

04:37.356 --> 04:40.902
BUT SHE WASN'T READY FOR WHAT WAS
COMING HER WAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:40.903 --> 04:42.228
FOUR MINUTES, PEOPLE.
FOUR MINUTES.

04:42.229 --> 04:44.922
I MEAN... I WAS THINKING
OF MAKING HER

04:44.923 --> 04:46.787
THE FACE OF MY CAMPAIGN.

04:46.788 --> 04:49.052
THAT WOULD'VE MEANT
PHOTO SHOOTS, MAGAZINES,

04:49.053 --> 04:51.266
BILLBOARDS IN TIMES SQUARE,
TRAVEL,

04:51.267 --> 04:53.533
NOT TO MENTION
A VERY GENEROUS PAYCHECK.

04:53.534 --> 04:55.975
SEEMS TO BE ALL PRET HEADY
STUFF FOR A NAIVE YOUNG GIRL.

04:55.976 --> 04:59.770
IN RECENT WEEKS, SHE'D BECOME
SO BAD TEMPERED, UH, PARANOID.

04:59.771 --> 05:02.204
I'D STARTED TO WONDER
IF SHE WASN'T TOO INEXPERIENCED

05:02.205 --> 05:03.618
FOR A MAJOR CAMPAIGN.

05:03.619 --> 05:05.185
YOU SAID
THAT SHE WAS PARANOID.

05:05.186 --> 05:07.497
ANY CHANCE SHE WAS DOING
DRUGS? NOT HER STYLE.

05:07.498 --> 05:09.375
TEDDY, IF YOU WANT ME
TO SHOOT THE GIRLS,

05:09.376 --> 05:15.155
YOU NEED TO GET THAT BOY-BAND POSER OUT
OF MY SEAT. WYATT, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

05:15.156 --> 05:16.904
UH, MR. FARROW,
JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS.

05:16.905 --> 05:19.093
YES.
BUT QUICKLY, PLEASE.

05:19.094 --> 05:21.393
WHO WAS JENNA WITH
LAST NIGHT AT YOUR PARTY?

05:21.394 --> 05:23.839
CASTLE, FOCUS.
I ONLY SAW HER BRIEFLY.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.206
SHE SPENT MOST OF HER TIME
WITH SIERRA, HER BEST FRIEND.

05:27.207 --> 05:29.601
THAT'S SIERRA THERE,
WITH THE WEDDING GOWN.

05:29.632 --> 05:31.948
SO IF THAT'S ALL,
NOW I REALLY MUST TAKE CARE

05:31.949 --> 05:35.156
OF LAST-MINUTE DETAILS.
UH, ONE LAST THING.

05:35.157 --> 05:37.484
WHEN, UH, JENNA LEFT YOUR PARTY,
WAS SHE WEARING SHOES?

05:37.485 --> 05:41.093
YES. UH, CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN PINK SA

05:41.094 --> 05:42.396
I LENT HER FOR THE EVENING.

05:42.397 --> 05:45.998
THE DRESS SHE WAS WEARING
WAS A ONE OF A KIND.

05:45.999 --> 05:48.150
I DON'T SUPPOSE
WE CAN HAVE IT RETURNED.

05:48.152 --> 05:50.007
IT'S IN EVIDENCE NOW.

05:50.009 --> 05:54.405
AND IT HAS A HOLE IN THE BACK
OF IT WHERE SHE WAS STABBED.

05:54.406 --> 05:56.419
SORRY.

05:59.668 --> 06:00.920
RICK CASTLE.

06:00.921 --> 06:02.763
IT'S SO FUNNY
I RAN INTO YOU TODAY.

06:02.764 --> 06:06.018
I JUST BOUGHT THIS
ON MY WAY IN.

06:06.019 --> 06:08.099
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S MY COVER.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.840
AND IT'S ON STANDS ALREADY.
"RICHARD CASTLE GETS THE INSPIRATION

06:10.841 --> 06:12.702
"FOR HIS LATEST NOVEL,
'HEAT WAVE'... "

06:12.703 --> 06:14.100
MM. "AND HIS NEW CHARACTER NIKKI HEAT

06:14.102 --> 06:17.265
FROM NEW YORK'S FINEST."
THAT'S NICE, RIGHT?

06:17.266 --> 06:20.273
COULD YOU
- YES, ABSOLUTELY. WHO SHOULD I MAKE IT OUT TO?

06:20.274 --> 06:22.502
OH. YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

06:22.503 --> 06:25.281
NO-YES. OF COURSE I DO.
YEAH. YOU'RE-

06:25.282 --> 06:29.034
RINA. RINA. YES. WE MET
AT THAT PARTY WITH THAT-

06:29.035 --> 06:30.787
THAT THING THAT WAS LATE,
AND IT WAS CRAZY.

06:30.788 --> 06:33.170
THAT-WOW, WHAT A NIGHT. LET'S
GO, MODELS. TAKE YOUR PLACES.

06:33.171 --> 06:35.488
I NEED YOU UP HERE
AND IN LINE.

06:35.490 --> 06:36.986
HERE.

06:39.095 --> 06:41.305
CALL ME.

06:45.832 --> 06:48.089
YOU'RE IN HERE, TOO,
YOU KNOW?

06:54.593 --> 06:55.847
OH, GOD.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.439
I FEEL SICK.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.481
AND I'M WEARING HER GOWN.

06:59.482 --> 07:01.349
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO CLOSE
THE SHOW TODAY, NOT ME.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.280
I CALLED HER THIS MORNING
LIKE A MILLION TIMES,

07:04.281 --> 07:07.373
BUT IT JUST KEPT GOING TO VOICE
MAIL. WHEN DID JENNA LEAVE THE PARTY

07:08.374 --> 07:10.097
UH, AROUND MIDNIGHT.

07:10.099 --> 07:11.705
I ASSUMED
SHE WAS GOING HOME.

07:11.706 --> 07:14.367
MR. FARROW MENTIONED THAT
SHE SEEMED AGITATED LATELY.

07:14.368 --> 07:17.334
TOMORROW, TEDDY'S ANNOUNCING
THE NEW FACE OF HIS COLLECTION.

07:17.335 --> 07:19.497
JENNA WAS UP FOR THE JOB,
AND SHE WAS A LITTLE TENSE.

07:19.499 --> 07:22.280
BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY
REASON TO BE. WHY NOT?

07:22.281 --> 07:26.660
SHE WAS A LOCK.
JENNA WAS TEDDY'S FAVORITE.

07:26.662 --> 07:27.650
OH, GOD.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.955
DOES TRAVIS KNOW?

07:29.957 --> 07:33.520
HER HUSBAND?
HE'S GONNA BE DEVASTATED.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.050
THEY WERE SO IN LOVE.

07:36.052 --> 07:38.168
I WENT TO BED AROUND 11:00.

07:38.169 --> 07:40.770
I FIGURED SHE'D WAKE ME
WHEN SHE GOT IN.

07:40.772 --> 07:43.035
BUT AT 3:00 A.M.,
SHE WASN'T HOME.

07:43.036 --> 07:45.735
SO...
I CALLED HER CELL PHONE.

07:45.736 --> 07:47.639
SHE WASN'T THERE.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.925
I CALLED THE COPS.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.245
THEY SAID
I HAD TO WAIT 48 HOURS

07:51.246 --> 07:52.979
TILL I COULD
REPORT HER MISSING.

07:52.980 --> 07:55.309
I TOLD THEM,
"YOU DON'T KNOW MY WIFE.

07:55.310 --> 08:00.295
IF SHE'S NOT HOME BY NOW,
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HER."

08:00.298 --> 08:03.912
GOD, I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.
TH-

08:03.913 --> 08:05.104
THESE PARTIES, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE JUST-

08:05.105 --> 08:07.505
EVERYONE'S SO PHONY.

08:07.508 --> 08:09.083
TRAVIS, I KNOW
THIS IS DIFFICULT,

08:09.084 --> 08:12.990
BUT I HAVE TO ASK YOU
THIS QUESTION.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.786
WAS THERE ANYONE
THAT YOU CAN THINK OF

08:14.787 --> 08:18.875
THAT WOULD WANT TO DO HARM
TO JENNA?

08:18.876 --> 08:21.927
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

08:21.928 --> 08:23.990
WE-WE-WE FILED
THE REPORTS.

08:23.993 --> 08:26.316
DID-DIDN'T THE OTHER COPS
SEND 'EM TO YOGUYS?

08:26.317 --> 08:29.016
REPORTS?
FOR HARASSMENT.

08:29.017 --> 08:31.898
SOME GUY
WAS SENDING JENNA LETTERS.

08:31.899 --> 08:34.078
LIKE, WRITING
ALL SORTS OF SICK THINGS.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.789
HE WAS TAKING PICTURES
OF HER, TOO.

08:35.791 --> 08:39.169
IT'S LIKE WAS WATCHING US
ALL THE TIME.

08:39.171 --> 08:42.241
SHE WAS FALLING APART.
I MEAN, WE BOTH WERE.

08:42.241 --> 08:45.479
HELL, WE ALMOST MOVED BACK
HOME. AND YOU FILED A REPORT?

08:45.480 --> 08:47.550
YEAH, A DOZEN OF 'EM.

08:47.553 --> 08:50.558
AND EVERY TIME, YOU PEOPLE
SAID THE SAME DAMN THING.

08:50.559 --> 08:53.150
THAT THIS IS NEW YORK,

08:53.151 --> 08:54.960
AND YOU GOT
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO

08:54.961 --> 08:58.165
THAN TO TRACK DOWN
SOME ANNOYING FAN.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.913
AND NOW SHE'S DEAD.

08:59.914 --> 09:03.375
MY WIFE... IS DEAD.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.689
LETTERS WERE MAILED
FROM THE SOHO POST OFFICE.

09:05.690 --> 09:07.800
NO RETURN ADDRESS,
NO SIGNATURE.

09:07.801 --> 09:09.933
HMM. SO THE ANONYMOUS STALKER
DIDN'T WRITE DOW

09:09.934 --> 09:13.217
HIS NAME AND NUMBER?
YEAH, I'M JUST SAYIN'.

09:13.218 --> 09:15.564
"I SAW YOU TODAY IN THE SUBWAY.
DID YOU SEE ME?

09:15.565 --> 09:18.427
I WANTED TO TASTE YOU."
THAT'S PRETTY SICK STUFF.

09:18.428 --> 09:20.436
BUT HE DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIRECT THREATS.

09:20.437 --> 09:22.442
THAT'S WHY JENNA AND TRAVIS
COULDN'T GET THE BEAT COPS

09:22.443 --> 09:26.205
TO TAKE 'EM SERIOUSLY. BOY, TWO
SMALL-TOWN KIDS GO TO THE BIG CITY

09:26.206 --> 09:28.434
TO FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS,
AND THEN THIS.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.976
NOT THE FAIRY-TALE ENDING
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR, I'M SURE.

09:30.977 --> 09:32.710
YOU KNOW, TO TAKE THESE SHOTS,
HE WOULD'VE HAD TO HAVE BEEN

09:32.711 --> 09:36.417
ON A ROOFTOP
PRETTY CLOSE TO THE APARTMENT.

09:36.418 --> 09:39.362
NO WONDER
SHE WAS FREAKED OUT.

09:39.363 --> 09:41.309
FIND THE ROOF, SEE IF
THERE'S ANYTHING UP THERE

09:41.310 --> 09:42.911
THAT WE CAN USE
TO IDENTIFY HIM.

09:42.912 --> 09:45.840
THOSE COPS LET JENNA DOWN ONCE.
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN.

09:52.941 --> 09:57.120
HELLO. I'M HOME.
AND I BROUGHT CHOW FUN.

09:57.122 --> 09:58.740
HI,DAD -HI

09:58.745 --> 10:00.321
OH, NICE.

10:00.322 --> 10:02.408
BUT I ALREADY PICKED UP A COPY
ON MY WAY HOME.

10:02.409 --> 10:04.860
WELL, DID YOU READ IT?
WAS SHE KIND?

10:04.861 --> 10:07.931
THE WRITER LOVED YOU.
SHE LOVED DETECTIVE BECKETT.

10:07.932 --> 10:11.728
SHE EVEN LOVED THE BOOK.
IT WAS YOUR BASIC PUFF PIECE.

10:11.729 --> 10:13.910
WELL, I'M SURE MY MOTHER
WILL FIND SOMETHING TO SAY

10:13.911 --> 10:16.045
THAT WILL KEEP ME
FROM GETTING TOO PUFFED.

10:16.046 --> 10:17.487
NOT TONIGHT SHE WON'T.

10:17.488 --> 10:20.288
SHE'S IN HER ROOM, MOURNING
THE DEATH OF HER CAREER.

10:20.289 --> 10:22.083
OH, SHE DIDN'T GET
THAT PLAY?

10:22.084 --> 10:24.470
SHE DID. JUST NOT THE PART
SHE WANTED.

10:24.471 --> 10:28.215
THE PRODUCER SAID SHE'S
NOT RIGHT TO PLAY THE LEAD.

10:28.216 --> 10:30.143
THEY WANT HER TO PLAY
THE CRAZY GRANNY.

10:30.144 --> 10:32.550
OH, THE CRAZY GRANNY.

10:32.551 --> 10:34.923
WHO DIES IN ACT ONE...
OH.

10:34.924 --> 10:36.715
OFFSTAGE.
OH.

10:40.223 --> 10:40.942
NO.

10:40.943 --> 10:43.635
YOU EXPECTING A CALL?
A CALLBACK, ACTUALLY.

10:43.636 --> 10:46.223
I MET A NICE YOUNG WOMAN
AT FASHION WEEK.

10:46.224 --> 10:47.405
I LEFT HER A MESSAGE
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

10:48.406 --> 10:50.848
A MODEL?
MM-HMM.

10:50.849 --> 10:53.901
GEE, DAD. PICKING UP HOTTIES
WHILE YOU'RE WORKING A CASE?

10:53.902 --> 10:55.880
SHE PICKED ME UP,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

10:55.881 --> 10:58.663
SHE SAID WE KNEW EACH OTHER
FROM... SOMEWHERE.

10:58.664 --> 11:01.745
IT'S A CURSE, BEING
SO IRRESISTIBLE. HMM.

11:01.746 --> 11:03.623
WHAT'S THIS ONE'S NAME-
LOLA,

11:03.624 --> 11:06.384
BREE, TATIANA?

11:06.385 --> 11:08.253
RINA.

11:08.254 --> 11:10.438
DID YOU SAY RINA?
YEAH.

11:10.439 --> 11:12.424
BLONDE HAIR?
YEAH.

11:12.425 --> 11:14.333
BAMBI EYES?
YEAH.

11:14.334 --> 11:17.144
CUTE LITTLE OVERBITE?
YEAH.

11:17.145 --> 11:19.583
DAD, YOU KNOW RINA.

11:19.584 --> 11:23.049
SHE USED TO BABYSIT ME.
SHE USED TO WHAT YOU?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.972
BABY... SIT.

11:24.973 --> 11:26.849
REMEMBER? WE WATCHED
"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL" TOGETHER,

11:26.850 --> 11:28.910
LIKE, A MILLION TIMES.

11:28.911 --> 11:31.913
I- I VAGUELY REMEMBER A-A-
LIKE, A GANGLY GIRL

11:31.914 --> 11:34.210
<i>WITH STRINGY HAIR AND BRACES
NAMED KATRINA.</i>

11:34.211 --> 11:35.500
THAT'S THE ONE.

11:35.501 --> 11:37.393
SHE DID THE WHOLE
"UGLY DUCKLING TO SWAN" THING,

11:37.394 --> 11:39.547
SHORTENED HER NAME
AND BECAME A MODEL.

11:39.548 --> 11:42.014
THAT'S SO FUNNY
THAT YOU RAN INTO HER.

11:42.015 --> 11:43.731
THE WORLD IS REALLY SMALL.

11:43.732 --> 11:47.902
YEAH, SMALL AND CRUEL.

11:47.903 --> 11:48.995
I'M PUTTING THE TIME OF DEATH

11:48.996 --> 11:52.679
BETWEEN 2:00 AND 5:00 A.M.
SHE LEFT THE PARTY AT MIDNIGHT.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.775
SO WHERE WAS SHE
FOR TWO HOURS?

11:54.776 --> 11:56.595
ANY SIGNS
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?

11:56.596 --> 11:58.803
NO, BUT SHE PUT UP A FIGHT.

11:58.804 --> 12:01.178
THERE'S SOME BRUISING
ON HER ARMS AND HANDS,

12:01.179 --> 12:02.834
HER DRESS WAS TORN.

12:02.835 --> 12:04.861
THERE'S A CUT INSIDE OF
HER CHEEK, INDICATING THAT

12:04.862 --> 12:09.166
SHE WAS SLAPPED, HARD.
BUT HERE'S THE W PART-

12:09.167 --> 12:12.267
SHE WAS STABBED WITH SETHING
LONG AND SHARP.

12:12.268 --> 12:13.792
IT WASN'T YOUR TYPICAL BLADE.

12:13.793 --> 12:14.651
HOW SO?

12:14.652 --> 12:17.665
WELL, BASED ON THE WOUND,
I MADE A RECONSTRUCTION.

12:17.666 --> 12:20.705
IT'S 4-SIDED.
IT'S SLIMMER AT THE TIP

12:20.706 --> 12:23.495
AND GETS PROGRESSIVELY WIDER
AT THE BASE.

12:23.497 --> 12:26.539
ALSO, I FOUND TRACES
OF GLASS IN THE WOUND.

12:26.540 --> 12:30.215
SHE WAS STABBED
WITH THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT?

12:30.216 --> 12:31.716
EXCUSE ME.

12:34.065 --> 12:35.652
ESPOSITO, ANY LUCK?

12:35.653 --> 12:36.995
YEP, ROOFTOP

12:36.996 --> 12:38.827
is right across the street
from the vic's apartment.

12:38.828 --> 12:42.031
Easy access.
YOU FIND ANYTHING?

12:42.032 --> 12:45.328
LOTS OF CIGARETTE BUTTS,
SODA CANS AND AN EMPTY PACKAGE

12:45.329 --> 12:46.924
FOR A DIGITAL CAMERA
MEMORY CARD.

12:46.925 --> 12:49.126
GET IT TO C.S.U. SEE IF
YOU CAN PULL ANY PRINTS.

12:49.127 --> 12:50.855
ON OUR WAY.

12:51.696 --> 12:53.496
ANYTHING ELSE?
YEAH.

12:53.497 --> 12:57.011
PRELIMINARY TOX SCREEN INDICATES
HER BLOOD ALCOHOL WAS.02.

12:57.012 --> 12:59.657
AND THERE WERE TRACES
OF ADDMAIR IN HER SYSTEM.

12:59.658 --> 13:01.373
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S A FORM OF SPEED

13:01.374 --> 13:03.647
USUALLY PRESCRIBED
TO PEOPLE WITH A.D.D.

13:03.648 --> 13:05.974
BUT MODELS HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO BUY IT OFF THE STREET

13:05.975 --> 13:08.384
AND USE IT FOR WEIGHT LOSS.

13:08.385 --> 13:10.426
SO MUCH FOR HER
BEING ANTIDRUG.

13:10.427 --> 13:11.952
I GUESS
THE JOB AND THE STALKER

13:11.953 --> 13:14.261
WEREN'T THE ONLY THINGS
MAKING HER TENSE.

13:16.139 --> 13:18.670
DO YOU FIND IT ODD
JENNA HAD A STALKER?

13:18.671 --> 13:21.616
NO, NOT REALLY. WHY?
WELL, SHE WASN'T HEIDI KLUM.

13:21.617 --> 13:23.832
SHE HADN'T EVED
A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN.

13:23.833 --> 13:24.835
WELL, MAYBE THE GUY FIGURED

13:24.836 --> 13:26.606
HE WAS GETTING IN
ON THE GROUND FLOOR

13:26.607 --> 13:28.279
STALKER-WISE, YOU KNOW?

13:28.290 --> 13:30.170
BEAT THE RUSH.

13:30.171 --> 13:32.101
OH!

13:32.102 --> 13:35.886
YOU COULDN'T RESIST,
COULD YOU?

13:35.887 --> 13:37.219
PRETTY NICE WRITE-UP,
HUH?

13:37.220 --> 13:39.782
YEAH, IF YOU LIKE THOSE SORTS
OF FLUFF PIECES.

13:39.783 --> 13:42.051
FLUFF? THE REPORTER
MADE YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE

13:42.052 --> 13:44.825
A CROSS BETWEEN SHERLOCK HOLMES
AND ANGELINA JOLIE.

13:44.826 --> 13:46.757
AND THE PICTURE ISN'T
HALF BAD EITHER.

13:46.758 --> 13:50.394
THOUGH YOU DON'T ALWAYS NEED
TO CROSS YOUR ARMS. IT'S FINE.

13:50.395 --> 13:52.522
THEN WHY ARE YOU UPSET?

13:52.523 --> 13:53.405
I'M NOT UPSET.

13:53.406 --> 13:55.302
YOU LOOK UPSET.
WELL, I'M NOT.

13:55.303 --> 13:57.479
BUT IF YOU WERE UPSET, YOU
WOULD TELL ME, RIGHT? I'M NOT.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.103
BUT IF YOU WERE
- IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE I'M NOT UPSET.

14:01.104 --> 14:02.718
WELL, WELL, WELL.

14:02.719 --> 14:05.344
RICHARD CASTLE-
THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.155
OH, DO YOU MEAN THIS?
PRETTY FLATTERING, RIGHT?

14:08.156 --> 14:10.128
AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO.
OLD NEWS, MY FRIEND.

14:10.129 --> 14:13.029
I'M TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY,
FASHION WEEK. WORD ON THE STREET

14:13.030 --> 14:14.957
IS YOU BROUGHT BACK
A LITTLE SOUVENIR.

14:14.958 --> 14:18.674
THE DIGITS OF A PARTICULAR
YOUNG HONEY NAMED RINA?

14:18.675 --> 14:20.350
RINA.

14:20.361 --> 14:22.591
I MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED IT
TO THEM IN PASSING.

14:22.592 --> 14:25.923
COME ON, CASTLE. TAKE PITY ON
YOUR MODEL-DEPRIVED BROTHERS.

14:25.924 --> 14:28.829
GIVE US THE STATS. WAS SHE
THE SEXY, CURVY LINGERIE TYPE

14:28.830 --> 14:32.247
THAT YOU COULD JUST- OR THE-THE
TONED AND TANNED BIKINI-WEARING TYPE?

14:32.248 --> 14:33.940
SHE'S MORE LIKE
THE "I'M TOTALLY PSYCHED

14:33.941 --> 14:36.214
I JUST GOT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE"
TYPE. OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:36.215 --> 14:38.423
YOU TWO SO NEED TO EVOLVE,
BECAUSE THAT LITTLE GIRL

14:38.424 --> 14:39.956
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT,

14:39.957 --> 14:41.473
THAT'S SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER,
ALL RIGHT?

14:41.474 --> 14:45.173
SHE'S SOMEBODY'S... BABYSITTER.
YOU GUYS, C.S.U. MATCHED A PRINT

14:45.174 --> 14:47.664
OFF THE MEMORY CARD
PACKAGING. WILL JAMES.

14:47.665 --> 14:50.268
UH-HUH. REAL CHARM BOY.
ON PROBATION

14:50.269 --> 14:54.734
FOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT, COUPLE OF
RESTRAINING ORDERS. SOUNDS LIKE OUR GUY.

14:55.601 --> 14:58.696
WILL JAMES, NYPD!

15:07.966 --> 15:08.669
WE'RE ALL CLEAR.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.158
YEAH, CLEAR IN HERE, TOO.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.153
YOU GUYS,
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

15:13.154 --> 15:15.393
JENNA'S COMP CARD.
COMP CARD?

15:15.394 --> 15:18.672
YEAH, AGENCIES USE IT
TO GET MODELS WORK. HUH.

15:18.673 --> 15:21.687
A SINGLE COMP CARD?
THAT'S NOT VERY STALKERY.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.540
WHERE'S THE BIG
CREEPY WALL OF JENNA?

15:23.541 --> 15:24.338
BECKETT?
YEAH.

15:24.339 --> 15:29.455
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING
- A CAMERA WITH A TELEPHOTO LENS. WHAT HAS IT GOT ON IT?

15:29.456 --> 15:31.906
NOTHING.
MAYBE IT'S BEEN ERASED.

15:33.226 --> 15:35.276
AH. Q-TECH, 4 GIG.

15:35.277 --> 15:36.740
SAME AS THE EMPTY PACKAGE
ON THE ROOF.

15:36.741 --> 15:39.221
GET IT TO C.S.U. SEE IF
THEY CAN RECOVER THE PHOTOS.

15:39.222 --> 15:40.361
IF THIS GUY HAD A THING
FOR JENNA,

15:40.362 --> 15:44.231
HE SURE WAS
SUBTLE ABOUT IT.

15:44.232 --> 15:46.645
DID YOU KNOW
WHAT A COMP CARD IS?

15:46.646 --> 15:48.822
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

15:52.943 --> 15:56.500
CAN I HELP YOU, OFFICERS?
WILL JAMES? GET YOUR HANDS UP.

15:56.501 --> 15:57.657
WE CAN PLACE YOU
ON THE ROOFTOP

15:57.658 --> 15:59.145
OF THE BUILDING
ACROSS FROM HERS,

15:59.146 --> 16:02.978
SO IF YOU WEREN'T TAKING PHOTOS, WHAT WERE
YOU DOING THERE? I DIDN'T KILL HER, ALL RIGHT?

16:02.979 --> 16:06.998
I WASN'T EVEN HERE SUNDAY. I WAS WORKIN'.
RIGHT, AT THE CASINO OVER IN ATLANTIC CITY.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.824
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE RUNNING IT DOWN NOW.

16:08.825 --> 16:10.149
IN THE MEANTIME,
MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN

16:10.150 --> 16:13.733
HOW THIS GOT
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

16:13.734 --> 16:18.466
HAVING PICTURES OF HOT CHICKS IS NOT A CRIME.
NO, BUT SENDING THEM THREATENING LETTERS IS.

16:18.467 --> 16:22.389
IF I MAY... "YOU WERE WEARING
A LOT OF MAKEUP TODAY.

16:22.390 --> 16:26.522
IT MADE YOU
LOOK LIKE A SLUT."

16:26.523 --> 16:30.087
OH, YOU GUYS
THINK I WROTE THAT?

16:33.247 --> 16:35.027
THAT GUY IS APTLY NAMED.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.540
HE GIVES ME THE WILLIES.

16:36.541 --> 16:38.231
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

16:38.232 --> 16:40.616
HIS ALIBI CHECKS OUT.

16:40.617 --> 16:41.937
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

16:41.938 --> 16:45.028
MNH-MNH. TALKED TO THE MANAGER
AT THE CASINO WHERE HE WORKS.

16:45.029 --> 16:47.769
SAYS THAT WILL JAMES WAS THERE
THE NIGHT THE GIRL WAS KILLED.

16:47.770 --> 16:51.647
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME KIND OF MISTAKE. MAYBE
HIS BOSS IS IN ON IT, COVERING FOR HIS FRIEND.

16:51.648 --> 16:54.769
I THOUGHT SO. SO THEY SENT OVER
THE SECURITY FOOTAGE.

16:54.770 --> 16:57.025
JAMES WAS PARKING CARS
ALL NIGHT.

16:57.026 --> 16:59.287
HE'S NOT OUR GUY.

17:01.278 --> 17:03.210
OKAY, I DON'T...
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:03.211 --> 17:06.643
WE'RE HOLDING HIM
ON STALKING CHARGES.

17:06.644 --> 17:08.266
BUT HE DIDN'T KILL HER.

17:08.267 --> 17:12.038
HE SENT THOSE LETTERS,
RIGHT? HE TOOK THE PICTURES?

17:12.039 --> 17:13.729
WE WON'T KNOW FOR SURE
UNLESS C.S.U.

17:13.730 --> 17:18.935
IS ABLE TO RECOVER FILES
FROM THE CAMERA CARD.

17:18.935 --> 17:21.969
WHOEVER KILLED JENNA,
WE WILL FIND THEM.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.961
I PROMISE.

17:23.962 --> 17:25.857
OKAY. JUST-
WHATEVER I CAN DO.

17:25.858 --> 17:28.778
WELL, THERE IS SOMETHING THAT
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

17:28.779 --> 17:31.094
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAID
THAT SHE FOUND ADDMAIR

17:31.095 --> 17:32.110
IN JENNA'S BLOOD STREAM.

17:32.111 --> 17:33.433
IT'S A TYPE OF AMPHETAMINE.

17:33.434 --> 17:36.313
NO. NO.
JENNA DIDN'T USE DRUGS.

17:36.314 --> 17:36.895
SOME PEOPLE SAY

17:36.896 --> 17:39.751
THAT SHE'D BEEN
ACTING NERVOUS LATELY, EDGY.

17:39.752 --> 17:43.114
SURE.
THAT WAS THE STRESS.

17:43.115 --> 17:45.741
LOOK, THESE LETTERS,
THEY REALLY SCARED HER.

17:45.742 --> 17:48.728
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL PEOPLE
AT WORK ABOUT 'EM.

17:48.729 --> 17:50.877
HOW WERE THINGS GOING
FOR HER AT WORK?

17:50.878 --> 17:52.248
WAS THERE ANYONE
SHE DIDN'T GET ALONG WITH-

17:52.249 --> 17:54.744
MR. FARROW PERHAPS?
NO. LOOK, SHE LOVED TEDDY.

17:54.745 --> 17:59.025
SHE GOT ALONG GOOD
WITH EVERYONE.

17:59.026 --> 18:01.847
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THIS ONE GUY.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.738
A PHOTOGRAPHER.
THEY HAD A FIGHT.

18:04.739 --> 18:06.393
ABOUT WHAT?
I GUESS HE WAS THE GUY

18:06.394 --> 18:08.337
THAT WAS GONNA SHOOT
THE FARROW CAMPAIGN.

18:08.338 --> 18:12.031
SO LAST WEEK, HE AND JENNA,
THEY DID THIS TEST SHOOT.

18:12.032 --> 18:13.703
SHE CAME HOME CRYING,

18:13.704 --> 18:16.776
SAID THAT
HER PICTURES WERE AWFUL.

18:16.777 --> 18:17.984
SHE WAS WORRIED SHE WOULDN'T
GET THE JOB NOW.

18:18.985 --> 18:21.590
DID JENNA SAY
WHAT WENT WRONG?

18:21.591 --> 18:24.177
SHE SAID THAT HE JUST
DIDN'T LIKE HER.

18:24.178 --> 18:27.811
HE WAS TRYING TO RUIN IT FOR HER
BY MAKING HER LOOK BAD.

18:27.812 --> 18:30.258
THIS PHOTOGRAPHER-
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

18:32.010 --> 18:32.557
MR. MONROE,

18:32.558 --> 18:35.026
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND JENNA?

18:35.027 --> 18:37.353
LOOK, JENNA WAS A GREAT MODEL AND A GREA

18:37.354 --> 18:39.971
BUT THAT DAY,
SHE WAS UNFOCUSED, AWKWARD.

18:39.972 --> 18:44.218
WE HAD WORDS, BUT WE
RESOLVED OUR ISSUES. HOW?

18:44.219 --> 18:47.478
I AGREED TO DO ANOTHER TEST
ON MY TIME AND MY DIME.

18:47.479 --> 18:48.553
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET
YESTERDAY

18:48.554 --> 18:52.347
AFTER THE RUNWAY SHOW, BUT
- CAN YOU CONFIRM WHERE YOU WERE AT BETWEEN 1:00 AND 5:00 A.M.

18:52.348 --> 18:56.374
THE NIGHT SHE DIED? I WAS AT
THE ZAC POSEN PARTY UNTIL 3:00,

18:56.375 --> 18:59.472
AND THEN HOME ASLEEP.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.420
THANK YOU, MR. MONROE.

19:01.421 --> 19:03.236
<i>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN-</i>

19:03.237 --> 19:05.883
<i>TEDDY FARROW!</i>

19:09.972 --> 19:11.242
GOOD AFTERNOON.

19:12.350 --> 19:15.259
IT'S BEEN A HARD WEEK
FOR US HERE AT TEDDY FARROW.

19:15.260 --> 19:16.823
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD,

19:16.824 --> 19:20.281
WE LOST ONE OF OUR OWN
ON SUNDAY NIGHT.

19:20.282 --> 19:25.020
JENNA McBOYD WAS TAKEN
FROM THIS WORLD TOO SOON.

19:25.021 --> 19:28.483
BUT EVEN AS WE HONOR HER MEMORY,

19:28.484 --> 19:30.916
SHE WOULD'VE WANTED US
TO CARRY ON.

19:30.917 --> 19:33.064
AND THAT'S WHY
I'VE INVITED YOU HERE,

19:33.065 --> 19:36.541
TO INTRODUCE THE NEW FACE
OF MY COLLECTION.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.560
SHE'S AN EXCITING TALENT.

19:38.561 --> 19:41.482
AND TOGETHER, WE SHALL ACHIEVE
GREAT THINGS.

19:41.483 --> 19:45.469
I GIVE YOU
MISS SIERRA GOODWIN.

20:03.104 --> 20:03.783
AND THERE'S SIERRA,

20:03.784 --> 20:08.084
STEPPING IN FOR HER
GOOD FRIEND JENNA AGAIN.

20:08.085 --> 20:09.532
IS IT JUST ME

20:09.533 --> 20:12.242
OR DOES SHE LOOK
REALLY HAPPY?

20:15.568 --> 20:18.526
WHAT WAS IT THAT TEDDY WAS
SAYING ABOUT HIS NEW FACE?

20:18.527 --> 20:22.027
A PICTURE IN EVERY MAGAZINE,
A BILLBOARD IN TIMES SQUARE,

20:22.028 --> 20:23.342
A HUGE PAYCHECK-

20:23.343 --> 20:25.465
DEFINITELY WORTH KILLING FOR.

20:25.466 --> 20:27.301
CASTLE, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT ONE GIRL

20:27.302 --> 20:29.218
MURDERING ANOTHER FOR A JOB.

20:29.219 --> 20:31.627
IT'S NOT A JOB.
IT'S A CAMPAIGN-

20:31.628 --> 20:34.338
A CAREER-MER-MAKER-AND JEALOUSY'S
A CLASSIC MOTIVE.

20:34.339 --> 20:34.894
YOU'VE SEEN THE FILMS-

20:34.895 --> 20:37.323
"THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,"
"DEAD RINGERS," AND, OF COURSE,

20:37.324 --> 20:40.951
THE UNDERRATED CLASSIC "SHOWGIRLS."
NOBODY MURDERED ANYONE IN "SHOWGIRLS."

20:42.249 --> 20:43.360
I HEAR.

20:43.361 --> 20:45.185
SIERRA WANTS TO BE
TEDDY'S FAVORITE.

20:45.186 --> 20:47.066
BUT SHE'S ALWAYS
SECOND CHOICE.

20:47.067 --> 20:49.389
SIERRA THINKS,
WHAT IF JENNA WAS GONE?

20:49.390 --> 20:51.051
THEN I'D BE NUMBER ONE.

20:51.052 --> 20:53.273
THEN I WOULD FINALLY GET
EVERYTHING THAT I DESERVE.

20:53.274 --> 20:56.821
AND THEN ONE NIGHT,
SHE SEES HER CHANCE.

20:56.822 --> 21:00.455
SHE LURES JENNA
SOMEWHERE QUIET...

21:00.460 --> 21:01.736
DESERTED.

21:01.737 --> 21:05.603
AND WHEN JENNA TURNS HER BACK,
SIERRA STABS HER.

21:05.604 --> 21:07.269
WITH THE STATUE
OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT

21:07.270 --> 21:09.286
THAT SHE CARRIES
IN HER PURSE?

21:09.287 --> 21:11.498
AND THEN STEALS HER SHOES.
MM.

21:11.499 --> 21:13.899
NOT A PERFECT THEORY,
BUT WE'RE HERE ANYWAY.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.318
SO NO HARM IN LEARNING
A LITTLE BIT MORE

21:16.319 --> 21:20.533
ABOUT WHAT MAKES
SIERRA GOODWIN TICK.

21:21.578 --> 21:24.192
AND I SEE JUST THE GIRL
TO CLUE US IN.

21:27.974 --> 21:28.572
RICK.

21:28.573 --> 21:31.419
UH, THAT'S MR. CASTLE
TO YOU, MISSY.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.197
RINA,
THIS IS DETECTIVE BECKETT.

21:33.198 --> 21:36.303
DETECTIVE BECKETT, RINA.
SHE USED TO BABYSIT FOR ME.

21:36.304 --> 21:39.390
FOR-I MEAN ALEXIS.
YOU DON'T SAY?

21:39.391 --> 21:41.476
ACTUALLY, WE'RE HERE
ABOUT JENNA.

21:41.477 --> 21:43.524
OH. THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE.

21:43.525 --> 21:45.093
YEAH. WAS IT TRUE
THAT SHE AND SIERRA GOODWIN

21:45.094 --> 21:46.710
WERE KINDA B.F.F.s?

21:46.711 --> 21:50.751
I WOULDN'T SAY B.F.F.s.
SIERRA'S MORE OF A FRENEMY.

21:50.752 --> 21:53.224
HOW SO? SHE DOESN'T
PLAY WELL WITH OTHERS.

21:53.225 --> 21:54.571
SHE EVER PUSH ANYBODY
DOWN THE STAIRS?

21:54.572 --> 21:58.646
NO. STUPID STUFF, REALLY-
LYING ABOUT WHEN A CALL TIME IS,

21:58.647 --> 22:00.646
ITCHING POWDER
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR-

22:00.647 --> 22:03.532
WAIT, AND THIS ONE TIME,
SHE CRUSHED UP A DIET PILL

22:03.534 --> 22:06.193
AND DROPPED IT INTO
ANOTHER MODEL'S CHAMPAGNE.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.827
YOU'RE SAYING
SHE DOSED SOMEONE.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.193
THE GIRL GOT ALL WIRED
AND CALLED CALVIN KLEIN

22:10.194 --> 22:12.601
A BORING, OLD FART...

22:12.602 --> 22:13.635
TO HIS FACE.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.300
OH.

22:15.409 --> 22:18.683
THANK YOU, RINA.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

22:29.907 --> 22:32.864
GOT SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO SHARE WITH THE CLASS?

22:32.865 --> 22:34.281
I WAS JUST THINKING...

22:34.282 --> 22:36.015
MAYBE JENNA
DIDN'T USE DRUGS.

22:36.016 --> 22:37.863
MAYBE SIERRA WAS SLIPPING 'EM
INTO HER DRINKS

22:37.864 --> 22:38.869
WHEN TEDDY FARROW WAS AROUND

22:38.880 --> 22:41.154
TO MAKE HER SEEM CRAZY
OR PARANOID.

22:41.155 --> 22:42.737
<i>NOW THAT IS AN EVIL DEED</i>

22:42.738 --> 22:45.258
WORTHY OF THE "SHOWGIRLS"
SPECIAL EDITION.

22:45.259 --> 22:47.618
WHAT ARE THOSE TWO
DOING HERE?

22:50.592 --> 22:52.515
OKAY, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING
ON? TECH MANAGED TO RECOVER

22:52.516 --> 22:54.835
E DELETED PHOTOS FROM
WILL JAMES' MEMORY CARD.

22:54.836 --> 22:56.262
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
JENNA'S KILLER,

22:56.263 --> 23:01.022
BUT HE WAS DEFINITELY HER STALKER. AND YOU
DROVE ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE JUST TO SHOW ME THIS?

23:01.024 --> 23:02.798
WE THOUGHT YOU'D WANT 'EM
RIGHT AWAY.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.476
THAT IS SO THOUGHTFUL
OF YOU GUYS.

23:05.477 --> 23:08.761
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BECKETT? YOU MISSING
THE GLAMOROUS LIFE? THE WHAT LIFE?

23:08.762 --> 23:11.168
CASTLE, HEY, IS YOUR,
UH, YOUR GIRL HERE?

23:11.169 --> 23:12.706
RINA.

23:12.707 --> 23:14.875
RINA USED TO BABYSIT ALEXIS,
FELLAS.

23:14.876 --> 23:16.691
SO AS FAR AS BIG RICK HERE
IS CONCERNED,

23:16.692 --> 23:19.036
SHE MIGHT AS WELL BE WEARING A CHASTITY
BELT. THANK YOU FOR THAT VISUAL IMAGE.

23:19.037 --> 23:25.332
THANKS. AND ALSO, THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME
"BIG RICK." HEY, BY THE WAY, OUR BUDDY WILL

23:25.333 --> 23:27.089
HAS A GIRLFRIEND
WE MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO.

23:27.090 --> 23:30.706
THERE'S, UH, SOME PHOTOS
OF HER RIGHT HERE IN THE BACK.

23:30.707 --> 23:34.322
MM. NAKED PHOTOS.
CASTLE, CHECK THIS OUT.

23:34.323 --> 23:37.338
LOOK AT NAKED PICTURES?
IF YOU INSIST.

23:37.339 --> 23:40.636
SHE'S WILL JAMES' GIRLFRIEND?

23:40.637 --> 23:41.219
LOOKS LIKE TEDDY FARROW

23:41.220 --> 23:44.613
ISN'T THE ONLY GUY
THAT SIERRA WAS MODELING FOR.

23:48.653 --> 23:51.410
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF
THE SPECTACLE YOU JUST CAUSED?

23:51.411 --> 23:54.078
I MEAN, WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU
DRAG THE FACE OFY CAMPAIGN

23:54.079 --> 23:56.998
OUT OF MY LAUNCH PARTY
AND BRING HER DOWN HERE

23:57.000 --> 23:59.760
AS IF SHE WERE SOME SORT
OF CRIMINAL? BECAUSE SHE IS.

23:59.761 --> 24:02.290
WILL JAMES' CONFESSION.
HE ADMITS SIERRA HIRED HIM

24:02.291 --> 24:04.068
TO TAKE THE STALKER PHOTOS
OF JENNA.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.048
HE EVEN HELPED HER WRITE
THE LETTERS.

24:05.484 --> 24:08.934
AND HE CLAIMS HE WAS SUPPLYING SIERRA
WITH ADDMAIR. SHE WAS DOSING JENNA.

24:08.935 --> 24:12.159
SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE HER SEEM PARANOID
AROUND YOU. WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

24:12.160 --> 24:14.539
TO PREY ON THE FEARS
OF A NAIVE COUPLE,

24:14.540 --> 24:16.826
PRESSURE THEM
INTO MOVING BACK TO OHIO

24:16.827 --> 24:20.215
SO SIERRA COULD TAKE HER PLACE. MR. FARROW,
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE EXPRESSION,

24:20.216 --> 24:21.715
"I WOULD KILL FOR THAT JOB"?

24:21.716 --> 24:24.536
BUT SHE WAS MY FACE-
MY FACE.

24:24.537 --> 24:26.562
I MEAN, HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS WILL DO TO ME,

24:26.563 --> 24:28.056
THE SCANDAL?

24:28.057 --> 24:30.666
IT WILL TAINT
THE ENTIRE SPRING LINE.

24:30.667 --> 24:33.727
A GIRL IS DEAD, MR. FARROW.
DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

24:33.728 --> 24:37.197
IT DOESN'T MEAN MY BUSINESS SHOULD
SUFFER. THEY'RE JUST CLOTHES.

24:37.198 --> 24:40.688
"JUST CLOTHES," DETECTIVE?
CLOTHES ARE CIVILIZATION.

24:40.690 --> 24:44.637
CLOTHES ARE WHAT SEPARATE US
FROM ANIMALS.

24:45.612 --> 24:47.982
NOT ALWAYS.

24:50.988 --> 24:52.709
SHE WAS
YOUR ONLY COMPETITION.

24:52.710 --> 24:54.318
YOU NEEDED HER
OUT OF THE WAY,

24:54.319 --> 24:57.776
AND YOU WERE RUNNING OUT OF
TIME. NO, NO. I DIDN'T KILL HER.

24:57.777 --> 25:00.004
RIGHT.
YOU JUST DRUGGED HER

25:00.005 --> 25:01.162
AND SENT HER
THREATENING LETTERS.

25:01.163 --> 25:04.803
WHERE WERE YOU AT 2:00 A.M.
ON SUNDAY NIGHT?

25:04.804 --> 25:08.537
SIERRA... YOU ARE FACING
A MURDER CHARGE.

25:08.538 --> 25:12.317
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME.

25:15.362 --> 25:18.200
SHE WENT TO WYATT'S PLACE.
THE PHOTOGRAPHER?

25:18.201 --> 25:19.922
JENNA WASN'T
JUST BEING PARANOID

25:19.923 --> 25:22.419
WHEN SHE SAID WYATT
SABOTAGED HER PHOTO SHOOT.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.575
HE DID.
WHY?

25:24.576 --> 25:27.416
BECAUSE JENNA
WOULDN'T SLEEP WITH HIM.

25:27.417 --> 25:29.666
IT'S LIKE AN OPEN SECRET
WITH THE GIRLS.

25:29.667 --> 25:32.211
YOU GIVE WYATT WHAT HE WANTS,
HE GIVES YOU GREAT SHOTS.

25:32.212 --> 25:35.901
IF YOU DON'T, HE CAN RUIN YOU.
AND HE WANTED JENNA.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.364
SO HE WAS MAKING HER CHOOSE

25:37.365 --> 25:39.904
BETWEEN HER CAREER
AND HER MARRIAGE VOWS?

25:39.905 --> 25:40.398
NICE GUY.

25:40.399 --> 25:42.649
SHE KNEW THE PHOTOS FROM
THE SECOND TEST HAD TO BE GREAT

25:42.650 --> 25:44.097
OR SHE REALLY WOULD
LOSE THE JOB.

25:44.098 --> 25:47.693
SHE NEEDED HIM TO DO IT RIGHT THIS
TIME. SO WHAT PPENED ON SUNDAY?

25:47.694 --> 25:49.137
SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD A PLAN.

25:49.138 --> 25:51.599
I FIGURED SHE WAS GONNA
GIVE WYATT WHAT HE WANTED.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.085
I JUST TOLD HER, "IT'S NOT
THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD,

25:54.086 --> 25:54.897
"YOU KNOW?

25:54.898 --> 26:00.075
YOU MIGHT EVEN LIKE IT.
I DID."

26:05.016 --> 26:07.563
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I SAW HER ALIVE.

26:07.564 --> 26:08.704
YO, BECKETT.
YEAH.

26:08.705 --> 26:11.451
WE JUST GOT THE RUNDOWN
ON WYATT MONROE. NO PRIORS.

26:11.452 --> 26:13.400
BUT TURNS OUT HIS APARTMENT
IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR

26:13.401 --> 26:15.532
TO THE ARTS CENTER,
AND HIS LIVING ROOM OVERLOOK

26:15.534 --> 26:18.743
THE FOUNTAIN WHERE JENNA WAS KILLED.
HE LIVES NEXT TO THE CRIME SCENE?

26:18.744 --> 26:20.613
WE RAN THAT ALIBI
THAT HE GAVE YOU.

26:20.614 --> 26:25.551
WITNESSES AT THE ZAC POSEN PARTY SAID HE LEFT
AROUND 11:30. HE TOLD US HE LEFT AT 3:00 A.M.

26:25.552 --> 26:28.079
OH, THERE'S MORE. WE CHECKED
WITH THE TEDDY FARROW PEOPLE.

26:28.080 --> 26:32.760
THEY SAID HE GOT TO THEIR PARTY
JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT. HE LIED TO US.

26:33.418 --> 26:36.408
I N'T TELL YOU HOW SHOCKED
I WAS WHEN SIERRA WAS ARRESTED.

26:36.409 --> 26:37.653
ARE YOU TWO CLOSE?

26:37.654 --> 26:40.926
I WOULDN'T SAY CLOSE, BUT I DID
A NUMBER OF SESSIONS WITH HER.

26:40.927 --> 26:43.203
SO WE'VE HEARD.

26:44.221 --> 26:46.546
THAT'S A REALLY NICE VIEW.

26:46.547 --> 26:48.051
THANKS.

26:48.052 --> 26:50.876
SO HOW CAN HELP? YOU COULD
TELL ME WHY YOU DIDN'T MENTION

26:50.877 --> 26:54.660
GOING TO THE FARROW PARTY ON SUNDAY
NIGHT. MUST HAVE SLIPPED MY MIND.

26:54.661 --> 26:57.926
IT'S FASHION WEEK.
I GO TO A LOT OF PARTIES.

26:57.928 --> 26:58.561
HEY.

26:58.562 --> 26:59.985
HMM?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:59.986 --> 27:03.711
OH, DON'T MIND ME. DID YOU
TALK TO JENNA AT THE PARTY?

27:03.712 --> 27:05.630
I THINK I DID,
BUT JUST TO SAY HELLO.

27:05.631 --> 27:09.188
YOU DIDN'T PLAN ON A RENDEZVOUS
LATER ON AT YOUR PLACE? NO.

27:09.189 --> 27:12.184
OH, REALLY?
THEN WHOSE ARE THESE?

27:12.187 --> 27:13.799
CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN
PINK SATIN PUMPS

27:13.800 --> 27:15.715
ON LOAN FROM TEDDY FARROW.

27:15.715 --> 27:17.484
I DON'T KNOW
WHO THOSE BELONG TO.

27:17.485 --> 27:22.152
WHAT IS THIS AWARD, MR.
MONROE? IT'S THE HILO.

27:22.153 --> 27:26.381
"FOR EXCELLENCE
IN EDITORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY."

27:26.382 --> 27:28.721
LOOKS LIKE
ONE OF THESE IS MISSING.

27:28.722 --> 27:30.362
MR. MONROE, WHERE IS IT?

27:30.363 --> 27:32.963
THE CLEANING WOMAN,
UH, DROPPED IT...

27:32.964 --> 27:34.818
LAST WEEK.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.444
IT BROKE.

27:36.445 --> 27:38.951
YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.

27:38.952 --> 27:41.158
IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?

27:43.599 --> 27:44.934
OKAY.

27:44.936 --> 27:49.072
LOOK. JENNA WAS AT MY PLACE
ON SUNDAY NIGHT.

27:49.073 --> 27:51.485
BUT SHE WAS ALIVE WHEN SHE
LEFT. WHY WAS SHE THERE?

27:51.489 --> 27:55.199
SHE FOUND ME AT TEDDY'S PARTY,
SAID SHE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.956
WANTED US TO WORK TOGETHER
FROM NOW ON AS A TEAM.

27:57.958 --> 28:01.525
AND YOU ASSUMED
THAT WAS CODE FOR "DO ME."

28:01.526 --> 28:03.528
WE AGREED
TO MEET BACK AT MY PLACE.

28:03.529 --> 28:05.040
SHE CAME IN,
WE HAD A DRINK,

28:05.041 --> 28:06.904
GOT COMFORTABLE
ON THE COUCH.

28:06.905 --> 28:08.601
I WAS READY
TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS,

28:08.602 --> 28:11.682
BUT SHE KEPT WANTING
TO TALK ABOUT OUR DEAL.

28:11.686 --> 28:12.714
THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLED IT.

28:12.715 --> 28:15.650
SAID SHE WANTED ME TO TELL HER
EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD TO DO

28:15.651 --> 28:20.032
TO GET GOOD SHOTS
- EXACTLY. SHE WAS TRYING TO GET YOU TO INCRIMINATE YOURSELF.

28:20.033 --> 28:22.476
A MASTER SPY
THIS GIRL WAS NOT.

28:22.477 --> 28:24.182
I GRABBED HER PURSE,
PULLED OUT HER PHONE.

28:24.183 --> 28:27.193
DAMNHING HAD AN APP ON IT
THAT TURNED IT INTO A RECORDER.

28:27.194 --> 28:31.303
SHE TAPED OUR WHOLE CONVERSATION. SHE WANTED
TO RECORD HIM DEMANDING SEX FOR GOOD SHOTS

28:31.304 --> 28:32.894
SO SHE COULD PLAY IT
FOR TEDDY FARROW. YEAH.

28:32.895 --> 28:34.863
SHE GRABBED THE PHONE BACK.
WE STRUGGLED.

28:34.864 --> 28:36.462
SHE PICKED UP MY AWARD
OFF THE SHELF,

28:36.463 --> 28:38.492
STARTED WAVING IT AROUND
AND ACTING CRAZY.

28:38.493 --> 28:41.059
SHE SMACKED THHILO INTO
A BOOKSHELF. THE TIP BROKE OFF.

28:41.481 --> 28:45.177
I TRIED TO GRAB IT.
SHE CUT ME WITH THE EDGE.

28:45.178 --> 28:49.135
SO I BACKED OFF,
AND SHE LEFT.

28:49.136 --> 28:52.038
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GREAT STORY,
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

28:52.039 --> 28:54.339
JUST LISTEN TO THE RECORDING
ON HER PHONE.

28:54.340 --> 28:55.326
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

28:55.327 --> 28:57.231
HER PURSE
WAS NEVER FOUND.

28:57.232 --> 28:58.942
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
THE EVIDCE THAT'LL CLEAR YOU

28:58.943 --> 29:01.305
IS LYING
IN A LANDFILL SOMEWHERE

29:01.309 --> 29:03.486
ALONG WITH YOUR HILO.

29:03.487 --> 29:06.140
TOUGH BREAK.

29:06.141 --> 29:07.704
%%%???

29:08.907 --> 29:12.349
NOT EVERYBODY IN THAT BUSINESS IS
PREDATORY. IT SURE SEEMS THAT WAY.

29:12.350 --> 29:14.034
JENNA'S BEST FRIEND
WAS DRUGGING HER,

29:14.035 --> 29:16.961
AND HER PHOTOGRAPHER KILLED HER. EVEN HER
CLOTHING DESIGNER SEEMED MORE INTERESTED

29:16.962 --> 29:19.315
IN HIS SHOW
THAN IN HER MURDER.

29:19.316 --> 29:20.352
BUT AT LEAST
WE GOT THE BAD GUY.

29:20.353 --> 29:23.433
THAT'S SOMETHING.

29:24.355 --> 29:25.637
WHAT?

29:25.638 --> 29:27.495
IF WYATT KILLED HER,

29:27.496 --> 29:31.781
WHY DIDN'T HE DO A BETTER JOB
OF CLEANING UP HIS PLACE?

29:31.782 --> 29:34.679
AND WHY WOULD HE LEAVE HER BODY
RIGHT OUTSIDE OF HIS APARTMENT?

29:34.680 --> 29:37.157
MAYBE HE'S NOT THAT BRIGHT.

29:37.158 --> 29:39.154
OR MAYBE HE WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH.

29:39.155 --> 29:42.078
MAYBE HE DIDN'T DO IT.

29:43.523 --> 29:45.406
WHAT'S UP WITH THE STROLL
DOWN MEMORY LANE?

29:45.407 --> 29:47.133
OH, I CALLED MY AGENT

29:47.135 --> 29:49.033
AND TOLD HIM TO PASS
ON THE PLAY.

29:49.034 --> 29:51.505
I SAID, "MARTHA RODGERS
DOES NOT DIE IN THE FIRST ACT,

29:51.508 --> 29:54.575
AND SHE NEVER DIES
OFFSTAGE."

29:54.576 --> 29:55.683
FEEL BETTER?

29:55.684 --> 29:59.247
NO, I FEEL ROTTEN
AND OLD.

29:59.248 --> 30:01.540
I FEEL LIKE
I'M DYING OFFSTAGE.

30:01.541 --> 30:05.315
I WAS ALWAYS THE INGENUE,
THE LEAD, THE STAR.

30:05.316 --> 30:07.237
I LIKED IT THAT WAY.

30:07.238 --> 30:08.876
IT'S A POWERFUL THING,
KIDDO,

30:08.877 --> 30:12.230
TO BE YOUNG,
BEAUTIFUL, TALENTED.

30:12.231 --> 30:14.299
NO WOMAN
WANTS TO GIVE IT UP.

30:14.300 --> 30:17.270
YOU ARE STILL BEAUTIFUL
AND YOU ARE STILL TALENTED.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.715
AND YOU DIDN'T
GIVE UP YOUR YOUTH.

30:18.716 --> 30:20.082
YOU TRADED IT FOR WISDOM.

30:20.083 --> 30:21.552
WISDOM.

30:21.553 --> 30:25.705
WISDOM.

30:25.706 --> 30:31.965
GIMME THAT.

30:31.966 --> 30:36.129
RINA. HEY, ARE WE STILL ON
FOR THAT DATE TONIGHT?

30:36.130 --> 30:39.140
ALL RIGHT. YOU REMEMBER
WHERE I LIVE?

30:39.141 --> 30:43.235
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

30:43.236 --> 30:44.173
WHAT?

30:44.174 --> 30:46.209
ALEXIS TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT IT.

30:46.209 --> 30:47.787
AT GIRL
IS TOO YOUNG FOR YOU.

30:47.788 --> 30:49.681
OR I SHOULD SAY,
YOU ARE TOO OLD FOR HER.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.291
IT IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
OH-

30:51.292 --> 30:55.058
<i>AND UNEMPLOYED DIVAS WHO LIVE
IN GLASS HOUSES RENT FREE</i>

30:55.059 --> 30:57.796
SHOULD NOT THROW STONES.

30:57.797 --> 30:59.696
POINT TAKEN.

31:01.286 --> 31:02.323
WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?

31:02.324 --> 31:04.333
SUNSHINE ELECTRONICS.

31:04.334 --> 31:08.208
THAT'S TWO WORDS. NOPE. THAT'S WHERE
JENNA McBOYD BOUGHT HER NEW CELL PHONE.

31:08.209 --> 31:10.656
WHAT? SO I WAS TALKING
TO HER HUSBAND LAST NIGHT,

31:10.657 --> 31:13.133
AND ON A HUNCH, I ASK HIM
ABOUT HER CELL PHONE.

31:13.134 --> 31:15.441
HE SAID IT WOULDN'T ACCOMMODATE
A RECORDING APP.

31:15.442 --> 31:17.664
SO I CHECKED INTO
HER CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS.

31:17.665 --> 31:19.943
SHE BOUGHT A NEW CELL PHONE
THE DAY SHE DIED,

31:19.944 --> 31:21.240
AND IT HAD GPS IN IT,

31:21.241 --> 31:23.736
WHICH SHE HAD THE FORESIGHT
TO SWITCH ON.

31:23.737 --> 31:25.562
WHOA. YOU FOUND IT?

31:25.563 --> 31:29.681
IN A DUMPSTER ON WEST 81st.
UNIFORMS ARE BRINGING IT IN NOW.

31:29.683 --> 31:31.817
<i>STOP IT, WYATT!
GIVE ME THE PHONE!</i>

31:31.818 --> 31:35.628
SO FAR IT'S HAPPENING JUST
LIKE HE SAID IT DID. MM-HMM.

31:35.629 --> 31:38.292
<i>THIS IS WHEN HE SAID
SHE GRABBED THE WEAPON.</i>

31:38.293 --> 31:39.760
<i>GIVE THAT TO ME!</i>

31:39.761 --> 31:41.562
<i>STAY AWAY FROM ME.</i>

31:41.563 --> 31:43.635
<i>BE CAREFUL
WITH THAT THING.</i>

31:43.636 --> 31:46.764
<i>AAH! DAMN IT.</i>

31:46.765 --> 31:52.553
<i>I'M BLEEDING,
YOU CRAZY BITCH.</i>

31:52.554 --> 31:56.035
SOUNDS LIKE SHE LEFT THE PLACE ALIVE.
DOESN'T MEAN HE DIDN'T GO AFTER HER.

31:56.036 --> 31:56.808
YEAH, BUT IF HE WAS
GONNA KILL HER,

31:56.809 --> 31:59.997
HE WOULDN'T T HER LEAVE THE
APARTMENT. SHH. IT'S STILL GOING.

31:59.998 --> 32:03.309
<i>I NEED A CAB.
I'VE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.</i>

32:03.310 --> 32:05.901
<i>OH, MY GOD!
DID YOU FOLLOW ME?</i>

32:05.902 --> 32:10.629
<i>WAIT. LET GO OF ME. STOP!</i>

32:11.862 --> 32:14.246
SO...
WHAT'S OUR PLAN?

32:14.247 --> 32:15.365
MAKE HIM CONFESS.

32:15.366 --> 32:18.494
I DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA CRACK THAT EASY.

32:18.495 --> 32:19.483
I MEAN,
WHAT IF HE FIGURES OUT

32:19.484 --> 32:21.170
WE ONLY HAVE
A PARTIAL RECORDING,

32:21.171 --> 32:22.709
THAT THE MEMORY
ON THE PHONE RAN OUT

32:22.710 --> 32:27.483
BEFORE THE ACTUAL MURDER
TOOK PLACE? HE WON'T.

32:27.484 --> 32:30.678
WE, UH, WE DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF THAT HE DID IT.

32:30.679 --> 32:33.806
I MEAN, WHAT IF HE SHUTS DOWN
AND DOESN'T TALK? HE WON'T.

32:33.807 --> 32:36.434
HE'S NOT A STUPID MAN.
HE MIGHT ASK FOR A LAWYER.

32:36.435 --> 32:39.354
<i>HE WON'T. LOOK,
LET ME HANDLE THIS.</i>

32:39.355 --> 32:41.841
YOU CAN GO IN IF YOU WANT,
BUT DON'T SPEAK.

32:41.843 --> 32:44.117
I JUST-
DON'T SPEAK.

32:48.995 --> 32:52.894
<i>WHY DID YOU FOLLOW ME? WELL, IT
SEEMS LIKE I HAD A GOOD REASON.</i>

32:52.895 --> 32:54.478
OKAY, WAIT.
SHE WAS RECORDING ME?

32:54.479 --> 32:58.224
YOU FOLLOWED HER TO
FARROW'S PARTY SUNDAY NIGHT

32:58.225 --> 32:59.764
AND THEN
TO MONROE'S APTMENT.

32:59.765 --> 33:02.180
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SHE JUST-

33:02.181 --> 33:04.235
SHE HAD BEEN ACTING
SO STRANGE LATELY.

33:04.237 --> 33:09.211
AND THEN SIERRA TELLS ME ABOUT THIS PHOTOGRAPHER
- YOU TALKED WITH SIERRA ABOUT WYATT MONROE?

33:09.212 --> 33:11.442
SHE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT ME AND JENNA,

33:11.443 --> 33:14.509
THAT IT WA-WAS MORE THAN
JUST BUSINESS BETWEEN THEM,

33:14.510 --> 33:17.870
THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.

33:18.687 --> 33:21.173
LOOK, O-ONCE THIS
WAS IN MY HEAD, I-

33:21.174 --> 33:24.079
I COULDN'T
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.879
YEAH, I FOLLOWED HER
TO THE PARTY.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.785
THEY WERE TOGETHER.

33:29.786 --> 33:30.987
WHEN SHE DIDN'T GO HOME

33:30.988 --> 33:34.105
AND SHE WENT
HIS PLACE INSTEAD,

33:34.106 --> 33:35.144
I KNEW.

33:41.702 --> 33:43.143
OKAY, SO THEN YOU WAITED.

33:43.144 --> 33:47.068
SHE CAME OUT. HER CLOTHES
WERE ALL MESSED UP.

33:47.069 --> 33:49.238
HER LIPSTICK WAS...

33:49.239 --> 33:50.443
RUBBED OFF.

33:50.444 --> 33:51.781
YOU CALLED HER A WHORE.

33:51.782 --> 33:55.834
I TOLD HER
THAT SHE WAS MY WIFE-

33:55.835 --> 33:58.274
<i>MY WIFE.</i>

33:58.275 --> 33:59.863
AND SHE-SHE JUST
STARTED CRYING.

33:59.864 --> 34:02.723
SHE... SHE SAID
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND,

34:02.724 --> 34:05.579
THAT I WAS
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

34:06.474 --> 34:07.846
TRAVIS...

34:07.847 --> 34:13.652
I CAN'T HELP YOU
UNLESS YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

34:17.067 --> 34:20.284
AND THEN YOU SLAPPED HER,
HARD ENOUGH TO CUT HER CHEEK.

34:20.284 --> 34:22.312
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN-
LOOK, I JUST-I COULDN'T-

34:22.313 --> 34:23.824
I COULDN'T SEE STRAIGHT.

34:23.824 --> 34:25.820
IT'S LIKE I WASN'T EVEN
MYSELF ANYMORE.

34:25.821 --> 34:29.920
I WAS SO MAD, I JUST-I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING. AND SO YOU KILLED HER.

34:29.920 --> 34:34.248
NO. NO.
I DIDN'T KILL HER.

34:34.248 --> 34:37.311
TEDDY DID.
TEDDY FARROW?

34:37.312 --> 34:40.359
AW, MAN. IT WAS ALWAYS TEDDY.
IT WAS TEDDY THIS, TEDDY THAT.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.469
JUST, LIKE,
WHISPERING IN HER EAR.

34:42.469 --> 34:45.382
YOU KNOW, TELLING HER HOW TO
WALK, HOW TO TALK, WHO TO BE.

34:45.384 --> 34:49.333
JUST FEEDING HER MIND
WITH LIES.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.433
I TELL YOU WHAT,
IF ANYONE DID IT,

34:51.434 --> 34:56.231
IT WAS HIM.

34:56.232 --> 34:58.750
IT WAS YOU, TRAVIS,
IN THE PLAZA,

34:58.751 --> 35:00.604
NOT TEDDY...

35:00.605 --> 35:02.452
STANDING BY THE FOUNTAIN

35:02.453 --> 35:05.304
THINKING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
YOU'D DONE FOR HER,

35:05.305 --> 35:09.907
ABOUT HOW YOU MOVED TO
THIS CITY THAT YOU HATED????

35:09.908 --> 35:13.336
NOW SHE HAD SOMETHING
IN HER HANDS, SOMETHING SHARP.

35:13.337 --> 35:16.129
WHAT WAS IT?

35:16.130 --> 35:18.440
TRAVIS, DO YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO TURN THAT TAPE ON?

35:18.441 --> 35:18.713
DO YOU REALLY WANT

35:18.716 --> 35:23.458
TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAID
AND WHAT YOU DID?

35:36.290 --> 35:40.427
SHE WAS HOLDING
THIS BROKEN GLASS.

35:40.428 --> 35:41.472
TOLD ME TO STAY AWAY.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.700
AND SO YOU TOOK IT
FROM HER.

35:44.705 --> 35:46.295
IT JUST HAPPENED.

35:46.296 --> 35:49.178
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:58.116 --> 35:58.653
I S-

35:58.654 --> 36:01.747
I STABBED HER.

36:01.748 --> 36:05.003
I STABBED HER IN THE BACK.

36:05.351 --> 36:07.634
LOOK, SHE WAS-
SHE WAS TRYING TO LEAVE ME.

36:07.635 --> 36:10.258
I...
OH, I LOVED HER SO MUCH.

36:10.259 --> 36:13.511
I JUST-I COULDN'T
LET HER LEAVE ME.

36:13.512 --> 36:17.736
SHE WASN'T GONNA LEAVE YOU,
TRAVIS.

36:31.090 --> 36:33.456
<i>WHAT THE HELL?
YOU'RE RECORDING ME?!</i>

36:33.457 --> 36:35.089
<i>GIVE IT BACK,
WYATT.</i>

36:35.090 --> 36:37.080
<i>I- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.</i>

36:37.081 --> 36:39.721
<i>I- I WANT THE JOB, WYATT.</i>

36:39.722 --> 36:43.490
<i>BUT I LOVE MY HUSBAND.
I CAN'T DO THIS TO HIM.</i>

36:43.491 --> 36:47.743
<i>I WON'T!
YOU'RE HURTING ME!</i>

36:47.744 --> 36:54.423
<i>I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.
I WANT TO GO HOME!</i>

36:54.424 --> 36:57.236
HOME.

36:57.237 --> 36:59.149
SHE WAS TRYING TO GO HOME...

36:59.150 --> 37:01.360
TO YOU.

37:09.184 --> 37:10.857
THAT WAS
A RISKY BLUFF-

37:10.858 --> 37:13.384
THREATENING TO PLAY A RECORDING
WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE.

37:13.385 --> 37:15.583
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
A RISK TO ME.

37:15.584 --> 37:17.324
HE LOVED HIS WIFE
VERY MUCH.

37:17.325 --> 37:19.193
HE WOULDN'T WANT
TO RELIVE HER DEATH.

37:19.194 --> 37:21.207
WHAT ABOUT SIERRA?
WHAT ABOUT WYATT ME?

37:21.208 --> 37:23.867
THEY JUST GO FREE?
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE JUSTICE.

37:23.868 --> 37:26.502
WELL, I SPOKE WITH
TEDDY FARROW THIS MORNING.

37:26.503 --> 37:28.232
NOW THAT HE UNDERSTANDS
WHAT THOSE TWO DID TO JENNA,

37:28.233 --> 37:31.139
HE'S GONNA LAUNCH A VERY
DIFFERENT KIND OF CAMPAIGN.

37:31.140 --> 37:32.820
HE'S GONNA GET THEM BLACKBALLED
IN THE INDUSTRY.

37:32.828 --> 37:37.080
NO ONE WILL HIRE THEM AGAIN.
AH, YOU MEAN POETIC JUSTICE.

37:37.844 --> 37:42.600
WELL... AS A WRITER,
I GUESS I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

37:42.601 --> 37:44.959
I WISH I COULD FEEL
THAT WAY.

37:44.960 --> 37:49.933
I WISH I COULD FEEL
A SENSE OF... VICTORY.

37:50.887 --> 37:53.768
SO WHAT WOULD NIKKI HEAT DO
AFTER A BAD DAY?

37:54.552 --> 37:56.286
SHE'D GO HOME,

37:56.287 --> 37:59.588
POUR A STIFF DRINK,
RUN A HOT BATH,

37:59.589 --> 38:01.412
READ A GOOD BOOK.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.976
TOO BAD I DON'T HAVE
A GOOD BOOK TO READ.

38:02.977 --> 38:04.652
MM. I'D LET YOU HAVE
"HEAT WAVE,"

38:04.653 --> 38:07.034
BUT MY PUBLISHER DOESN'T WANT
ANY COPIES LEAKING OUT.

38:07.035 --> 38:10.735
WHY'D YOU LET THAT "COSMO" REPORTER READ IT,
THEN? WELL, THAT'S FOR PUBLICITY PURPOSES.

38:10.736 --> 38:14.003
YOU KNOW, YOU WANT THE PRESS
TO HAVE A LITTLE TASTE OF...

38:14.004 --> 38:17.274
WAIT. WHOA. IS... IS THAT
WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO UPSET,

38:17.275 --> 38:19.450
BECAUSE I LET HER READ IT
BEFORE YOU? I AM THE INSPIRATION.

38:19.451 --> 38:22.488
I SHOULD BE READING IT BEFORE A REPORTER
DOES. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY SO?

38:22.489 --> 38:24.407
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GIVE IT
TO ME? WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK?

38:24.408 --> 38:30.226
WHY DIDN'T IT OCCUR TO YOU?

38:30.227 --> 38:31.330
YOU'LL HAVE IT BY TOMORROW.

38:31.331 --> 38:34.382
GOOD.
GOOD.

38:45.442 --> 38:48.810
LOOKING GOOD,
DETECTIVE BECKETT.

38:49.219 --> 38:49.634
HOW DID YOU GUYS-

38:49.635 --> 38:52.684
WE'RE DETECTIVES.
CALLED YOUR DAD.

38:53.288 --> 38:53.938
OKAY.

38:54.864 --> 38:58.725
OKAY. YOU GUYS
HAVE HAD YOUR FUN.

38:58.726 --> 39:01.333
I WAS 17, AND I THOUGHT THAT...
MODELING

39:01.334 --> 39:02.703
WOULD BE
AN EASIER WAY TO MAKE MONEY

39:02.704 --> 39:05.282
THAN WAITRESSING.
RIGHT.

39:05.283 --> 39:09.290
IT WAS ONE SUMMER.
NO BIG DEAL.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.049
AND IF YOU GUYS
TELL CASTLE ABOUT IS,

39:13.050 --> 39:16.068
I WILL KILL YOU.

39:21.175 --> 39:23.754
GOOD EVENING, MY DEARS.

39:23.755 --> 39:24.568
HEY THERE.

39:24.569 --> 39:25.754
YOU LOOK
IN BRIGHTER SPIRITS.

39:25.755 --> 39:27.211
WHAT'S CHANGED
SINCE THIS MORNING?

39:27.212 --> 39:29.621
THE PLAY I PASSED ON?

39:29.622 --> 39:32.421
THE PRODUCERS CAME BACK
WITH A BETTER OFFER.

39:32.422 --> 39:35.438
I WAS JUST AT THE DORCHESTER
SIGNING MY CONTRACTS.

39:35.439 --> 39:36.504
SO YOU GOT THE LEAD?

39:36.505 --> 39:38.689
WELL, NO, I STILL PLAY
THE CRAZY GRANNY.

39:38.690 --> 39:41.426
BUT YOU-YOU DON'T DIE.
NO, STILL DIE.

39:41.427 --> 39:43.715
MORE MONEY?
PEANUTS.

39:43.716 --> 39:44.929
ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT'S
THE BETTER OFFER?

39:44.930 --> 39:48.116
THEY HAVE REWRITTEN THE SCRIPT
SO THAT I DIE ONSTAGE.

39:48.117 --> 39:50.904
MY DEATH CLOSES ACT ONE.

39:50.905 --> 39:52.901
IT'S BETTER THAN THE LEAD,
REALLY.

39:52.902 --> 39:54.861
GRANNY'S THE BRAVURA ROLE.

39:54.862 --> 39:57.048
IN ART AS IN LIFE.

39:57.049 --> 39:58.454
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
OH, THANK YOU.

39:58.455 --> 40:01.906
THANK YOU, MY BABY.

40:01.907 --> 40:04.169
ARE WE EXPECTING COMPANY?
UH, THAT'S RINA.

40:04.170 --> 40:06.525
OH, OF COURSE, YOUR DATE.

40:06.526 --> 40:08.020
NOT MY DATE.

40:08.021 --> 40:12.189
HI!
HEY.

40:12.190 --> 40:12.624
READY FOR

40:12.625 --> 40:16.001
A "HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL"
MARATHON? I'M SO READY.

40:18.067 --> 40:18.663
HEY, RINA.

40:18.664 --> 40:21.087
OH, HI, MR. CASTLE.
COME ON.

40:21.088 --> 40:23.758
OH, MY GOSH. THAT SHIRT
IS SO CUTE ON YOU.

40:23.759 --> 40:26.007
COLOR ME SHOCKED, BUT APPARENTLY
THE MODELING WORLD

40:26.008 --> 40:28.165
ISN'T ALL SEXY CLOTHES
AND FUN PARTIES.

40:28.166 --> 40:30.042
IT OCCURRED TOE THAT
IF JENNA McBOYD HAD SOMEONE

40:30.043 --> 40:31.271
LOOKING OUT
FOR HER A LITTLE BIT,

40:31.272 --> 40:33.067
SHE MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE TODAY.

40:33.068 --> 40:38.649
SO IF RINA NEEDS A FRIEND,
SHE KNOWS SHE'S GOT ONE.

40:38.650 --> 40:40.946
OH, MY SON...

40:40.947 --> 40:43.333
THE BIG SOFTIE.

40:43.334 --> 40:46.414
AND DON'T WORRY. I KNOW
YOU HAVE AN IMAGE TO PROTECT.

40:46.415 --> 40:49.190
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.
