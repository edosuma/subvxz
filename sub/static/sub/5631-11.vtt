.

00:01.302 --> 00:02.070
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:02.970 --> 00:04.538
sexually based offenses

00:04.538 --> 00:06.474
are considered especially
heinous.

00:06.474 --> 00:09.177
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.177 --> 00:11.011
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.011 --> 00:12.546
are members of an elite squad

00:12.546 --> 00:14.582
known as the
Special Victims Unit.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.350
These are their stories.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.153
[sirens blaring]

00:19.153 --> 00:22.190
[horns honking]

00:26.060 --> 00:27.095
[knocks on door]

00:30.364 --> 00:31.732
- Lucy.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.067
- Morning.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.435
Is Luca ready?

00:34.435 --> 00:36.837
- Oh, I meant to text you.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.173
You don't need to
walk him to school today.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.041
He has...strep.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.576
- Oh, poor kid.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.944
Well, does he need anything?

00:43.944 --> 00:45.179
- No!

00:45.179 --> 00:47.115
- My husband's helping out.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.316
We're set.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.918
- Okay, well, tell him
I hope he feels--

00:54.222 --> 00:55.956
- Noah, where's the apple again?

00:55.956 --> 00:58.025
Where do we have the apple?

00:58.025 --> 00:59.059
Thank you!

00:59.059 --> 01:00.528
Done.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.596
Now, can you show me--
Sorry, Lucy. One sec.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.797
Can you show me the orange?

01:03.797 --> 01:04.898
No...

01:04.898 --> 01:06.334
I'm sorry, Lucy.
What were you saying now?

01:06.334 --> 01:09.036
The Crivellos--that's the other
family that you work for?

01:09.036 --> 01:10.638
- Yes. There are two kids.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.306
I walk the younger boy,
Luca, to school.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.841
I went over this morning
to pick him up,

01:13.841 --> 01:16.644
and his mom sent me away.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.546
She was acting
really strange.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.948
Something was...off.

01:20.948 --> 01:21.982
- How do you mean?

01:21.982 --> 01:23.517
- Her voice was really shaky.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.486
She was really nervous.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.855
There were red marks
on her neck too.

01:27.855 --> 01:31.859
And her husband
was there, yelling.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.027
Maybe you could swing by?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.636
- Hi. Lisa.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.172
Olivia Benson.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.506
- Sure. Noah's mom.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.175
- Yeah.
- Lucy's not here.

01:47.175 --> 01:50.478
- Well, actually, I stopped by
to speak with you.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.614
- It's a bad day.
Luca's sick.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.383
- Yeah.

01:55.383 --> 01:58.252
You have a--you have a little
cut there, over your eye.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.454
- Oh, it's nothing.
I should go.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.457
- So how about
I come back later?

02:03.457 --> 02:04.892
- Let her in.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.395
- Actually, why not
just come in now?

02:07.395 --> 02:09.430
- Okay.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.600
Whoa.
Hey!

02:12.600 --> 02:14.602
- Hey, how you doing?
Show me your hands!

02:14.602 --> 02:17.438
- Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.939
- What are you doing?
Both hands up!

02:18.939 --> 02:20.441
- Now, bitch!

02:20.441 --> 02:21.775
You think we're playing
with you?

02:21.775 --> 02:24.445
- No.
No, I don't.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.114
Okay. You're both in charge.

02:27.114 --> 02:32.753
- One move, and I'll blow a hole
right through your face.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.822
- Okay.
Okay.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.290
- I'm sorry.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.631
[dramatic music]

03:27.308 --> 03:27.441
.

03:28.141 --> 03:28.609
- Who the hell is she?

03:29.410 --> 03:32.280
- Get me her purse.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.615
- My name is Olivia Benson,

03:34.615 --> 03:37.285
and I'm here by chance,

03:37.285 --> 03:40.521
but I'm a New York City
police officer.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.361
- You armed?

03:47.361 --> 03:49.630
- I am.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.800
My weapon is holstered
right here

03:52.800 --> 03:54.602
on my right hip.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.003
- Ralph?

03:56.003 --> 03:58.171
Come and take this.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.340
You carrying a drop?

03:59.340 --> 04:00.841
- I am not. I am not.
You can check.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.311
- I'm not asking permission.
- Okay.

04:03.311 --> 04:06.213
- Ooh...oh.

04:06.213 --> 04:09.817
We got a problem here.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.185
The old man tell you
where the money's at yet?

04:12.185 --> 04:13.521
- No.
He's holding out.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.189
- We don't keep cash here.
[yelps]

04:16.189 --> 04:17.858
- Right.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.893
Kick his ass until he coughs.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.333
- Ugh!
- [grunts]

04:25.333 --> 04:28.369
[kicking, groaning]

04:33.173 --> 04:34.875
- Who all knows you're here?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.710
- No one.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.178
- You better not
be lying to me.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.348
- I am not
lying to you.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.149
- This your son?

04:44.352 --> 04:46.620
Hmm?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.188
- It is.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.623
- Good.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.026
Means that you don't
want to die.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.962
Roxie, tie her up.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.897
- Listen to me.
We don't need to do that.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.065
Why don't we just talk?

04:58.065 --> 05:00.668
I know that you and I
can figure this--oh!

05:03.003 --> 05:08.241
- I told you
to shut the hell up.

05:12.713 --> 05:16.517
[phones ringing]

05:16.517 --> 05:18.519
- Anyone use a heavy bag
in the weight room?

05:18.519 --> 05:19.720
I brought my gloves.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.154
- You box?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.990
- Yeah, I did Golden Gloves
and pro-am.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.057
You?

05:24.057 --> 05:25.292
- I don't want to hurt you.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.561
- Hey. We got a call.
Where's Liv?

05:27.561 --> 05:28.696
- DNA conference all day.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.498
- Looks like our push-in rapist
struck again,

05:30.498 --> 05:31.499
this time in Chelsea.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.733
- Same guy?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.635
- He's black, tall,
in his twenties.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.936
He's armed, same M.O.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.571
Plus, the vics
ID'd the sketch.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.906
- Just like they did before.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.073
- All right.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.042
Either way,
let's bring him in alive.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.977
Fin, notify central,
alert transit--

05:43.977 --> 05:45.413
- And housing.
I know the drill.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.847
- I'm sure you do.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.516
Carisi, tell the one one
we're en route.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.451
I'll text Benson
when we get there.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.653
- Come on, Richard!

05:52.653 --> 05:53.887
- Ugh!
- [grunts]

05:53.887 --> 05:56.156
Boss man.
Where's the safe?

05:56.156 --> 05:58.426
- [groans]
Ralph, please.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.193
I told you,
we don't have a safe.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.695
- Useless!
- Ugh!

06:01.695 --> 06:04.465
[all gasp]

06:04.465 --> 06:08.001
- Joe, he says
they ain't got a safe.

06:08.001 --> 06:11.439
- You swore
that there was cash here.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.341
They own ten supermarkets.
- Yeah, okay.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.644
Roxie, she's upstairs.
She's going through the jewelry,

06:16.644 --> 06:18.245
and when she's done,
we should go.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.314
- You said there's a safe.
Go find it.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.354
- The girl rang the bell
at 6:00 a.m.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.989
Said she'd been robbed.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.158
I went to call 911.
Those two burst in.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.661
- Have you ever
seen them before?

06:33.661 --> 06:35.763
- The one with the hat,
Ralph.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.165
He used to drive a truck
for my husband's stores.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.100
Richard told me
he fired him.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.336
They've got Luca
tied upstairs.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.005
- What the hell's
taking Roxie so long?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.006
[phone chimes]

06:46.006 --> 06:48.108
Who's that?

06:48.108 --> 06:51.344
- Don't worry about it.
[sniffs]

06:51.344 --> 06:54.682
Go downstairs
and find that safe.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.592
- You got a text
about some rapist.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.127
- I really
need to answer that.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.697
Please.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.932
- There.
You just did.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.870
What did you find?

07:16.870 --> 07:19.507
- $200

07:19.507 --> 07:23.143
and a bunch
of crap jewelry.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.945
Where's the real stuff,
huh?

07:24.945 --> 07:28.782
- I told you
there's nothing in here.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.820
- Mm...maybe we should bring
the little boy downstairs.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.387
- Hold on there.
Let's not do that.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.525
- Wait.
We do have a safe deposit box.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.660
- Oh. Nearby?

07:39.660 --> 07:43.764
- Joe, hey man, hey,
I found some electronics.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.799
- New plan.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.435
We're taking Mommy
to the bank.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.641
- So you get back
from your run...

07:53.641 --> 07:55.042
- Yeah, I heard someone.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.644
I thought it was my husband,

07:56.644 --> 07:58.145
but then I felt the gun.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.279
- And where were you, sir?

07:59.279 --> 08:01.014
- The apartment door was open.

08:01.014 --> 08:04.217
I walk in, and then I see
this guy on top of Stacey.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.686
And I just yelled,
"Stop! Police!"

08:05.686 --> 08:06.854
I'm not police.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.355
- That's good.
You scared him.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.591
- Yeah, he--
he went out that window.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.225
Wasn't more than
20 minutes ago.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.362
- He didn't rape me,
but it was close.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.564
I scratched his face.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.566
- Okay, that's great.
DNA.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.200
- Swab and scrape her hands.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.174
Nothing on the canvass yet?

08:27.174 --> 08:29.142
- No.
Building's on lockdown.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.744
- That's a long jump down
He might be hurt.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.145
- He didn't jump.
He climbed up.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.214
Neighbors called in
a suspicious man checking doors

08:34.214 --> 08:35.215
on the adjacent roof.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.416
- Good.
He's stuck up there.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.450
- Let's go.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.290
- Luca?
- Where's Mommy?

08:43.290 --> 08:45.693
- Uh-uh.
- She's okay, sweetheart.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.060
- I have to pee.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.729
- Let me just check
if he's okay.

08:48.729 --> 08:49.730
I just want to help the kid.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.064
- Oh, you want to help?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.066
How about you get on the bed?

08:56.469 --> 08:57.938
Rox?

09:08.616 --> 09:11.619
[dramatic music]

09:11.619 --> 09:19.627
*

09:22.129 --> 09:23.731
- He's armed!
Gun on the ground, now!

09:23.731 --> 09:25.999
- Put the gun on the ground.
Come out with your hands up!

09:25.999 --> 09:28.068
- You gonna shoot me like you
did that other black man?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.638
- I'm not gonna shoot you.
Let's go.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.005
- All right,
hands on the wall!

09:32.005 --> 09:34.507
Hands on the wall!

09:34.507 --> 09:37.210
Come on.
Come on!

09:37.210 --> 09:38.245
Come here.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.850
[phone chimes]

09:42.850 --> 09:44.752
- [laughs]

09:44.752 --> 09:46.419
Hey.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.490
They caught your rapist.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.160
We should celebrate, huh?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.863
Who's up for a party?

09:55.863 --> 09:58.498
- Don't, Joe.
- Huh?

09:58.498 --> 10:00.668
Eeny...

10:00.668 --> 10:03.403
meeny...

10:03.403 --> 10:06.439
miney...

10:06.439 --> 10:07.641
ho.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.776
- [whispering]
Please...

10:08.776 --> 10:09.777
- You.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.279
- No. Please.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.881
- You're coming with me.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.282
- Joe, you don't need her.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.550
- Turn around
- Please help me! Please!

10:17.550 --> 10:19.286
- Joe...
- Please help me!

10:19.286 --> 10:22.222
Get off me!
Help!

10:22.222 --> 10:25.558
- Roxie, for God sakes,
do something.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.094
- Get off me, please!
- Hey!

10:27.094 --> 10:28.295
- Stop!
[door slams]

10:28.295 --> 10:30.998
- All you have to do
is go in there!

10:32.733 --> 10:35.803
Roxie, this is on you.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.537
Let me in there.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.571
Ah!

10:38.571 --> 10:41.141
[Tess screams]

10:43.443 --> 10:45.312
- Don't do that again.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.051
- Stop touching me!

10:51.051 --> 10:52.385
Please!

10:52.385 --> 10:53.954
[screaming]
Stop!

10:53.954 --> 10:56.056
Help me!

11:11.772 --> 11:11.905
.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.406
- You got the wrong guy.
Again.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.375
I'm gonna sue your asses.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.744
- You left prints and DNA.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.578
Lab's gonna tie you
to all those rapes.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.113
- That girl you assaulted
and stuffed in the dryer--

11:20.113 --> 11:21.481
you know she was 12?

11:21.481 --> 11:23.416
- Here's what I know:
lawyer.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.985
- Yeah, go ahead.
Lawyer up.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.320
You're still going down.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.922
- He's hurting her!
Make him stop!

11:28.922 --> 11:30.023
[Tess crying and screaming]

11:30.023 --> 11:31.591
She's crying.
Make him stop!

11:31.591 --> 11:33.293
- Can't you just shut up?
- Make him stop it!

11:33.293 --> 11:34.762
- Make him shut up.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.764
- Well, then, you're gonna
have to untie us, aren't you?

11:36.764 --> 11:37.765
- Make him stop it!
She's crying!

11:37.765 --> 11:38.766
- Please.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.100
I'm not gonna
do anything stupid.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.434
Just let me help the boy.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.271
- Make him stop it!
Someone help!

11:44.271 --> 11:47.440
Make him stop!
Someone help her!

11:54.014 --> 11:55.783
Someone help her.

11:55.783 --> 11:56.850
Make him stop it.
Someone help!

11:56.850 --> 11:58.886
- Get him...quiet.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.022
- Someone help!

12:02.022 --> 12:04.191
She's crying.
Make him stop.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.192
I want Tess.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.326
- I know you do.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.862
Come on. I know.
I know you do.

12:08.862 --> 12:12.099
Listen, I want you to take
a big, deep breath, okay?

12:12.099 --> 12:14.301
Deep, deep breath.
There you go, sweetheart.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.003
There you go.
Okay.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.806
Okay.
Here, are these yours?

12:18.806 --> 12:21.008
Huh? Do you know how
to turn on a movie?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.375
Okay.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.411
All right.
We can go sit down.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.517
- Help me!

12:30.517 --> 12:32.886
- This can't be the way
you wanted things to go down.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.087
- You don't know me.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.288
- I know that
you don't want

12:35.288 --> 12:38.458
to hear your boyfriend
raping a 16-year-old.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.526
- Well, Joe does Joe,

12:39.526 --> 12:40.560
and I do me,

12:40.560 --> 12:42.863
so why don't you sit down?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.264
- You can save yourself.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.033
- What are you,
Mother Theresa?

12:46.033 --> 12:47.835
I've already been saved,
by Joe.

12:47.835 --> 12:48.836
Okay?

12:48.836 --> 12:49.870
[phone chimes]

12:58.211 --> 12:59.980
Who's Lucy?

12:59.980 --> 13:02.015
- She's my sitter.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.583
She's also Luca's sitter,

13:03.583 --> 13:06.386
and she--she needs
to talk to me.

13:06.386 --> 13:10.657
She needs to know about
my son's daycare pickup.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.325
I really need to answer that.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.096
- Congratulations.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.131
You found another
unarmed black man.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.567
I suppose we should be grateful
that you didn't shoot him.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.568
- He had a gun on him.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.070
- Did he?
Who planted it?

13:23.070 --> 13:24.071
- Don't troll.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.105
This is your client's
third rape.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.339
We have multiple IDs.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.975
- DNA too.
Forensics will confirm.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.409
- Save it for the judge.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.543
May I?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.781
- Nice work.
Where's Liv?

13:34.781 --> 13:36.749
- She's still
at the DNA conference.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.285
- No, she's not.
I was there all morning.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.320
I would've seen her.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.890
[tapping]

13:46.159 --> 13:48.428
- Hey, Detective Carisi.
- Hey, Lucy.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.796
Liv's not in.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.664
- She's not?
I'm a little worried.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.333
This morning,
I sent her to the brownstone

13:53.333 --> 13:55.035
of another family
I sit for.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.037
I had a really strange vibe
from the mom, and--

13:57.037 --> 13:58.638
- Okay.
What did Liv say about it?

13:58.638 --> 14:00.240
- Well, I haven't been able
to talk to her.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.742
Look, she just sent me
this weird text.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.477
- All right.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.780
Guys, we got a problem here.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.649
Liv just texted this
to her babysitter.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.920
"Stuck at precinct all day.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.554
"Pick up William
at day care.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.224
He has a play date
with Lewis today."

14:17.224 --> 14:18.458
- William Lewis?

14:18.458 --> 14:20.360
That's not good.
When did you last hear from her?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.429
- I texted her a few hours ago
about the push-in rapist.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.496
She answered back.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.965
- But you didn't
actually speak to her?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.299
- No.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.201
- And now she's sending us
a text about William Lewis?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.937
- That's got to be a code
for ten-thirteen.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.572
- Lucy said that Liv checked
on a neighbor this morning.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.441
- Where?

14:34.441 --> 14:37.945
[phone ringing]

14:37.945 --> 14:40.247
- "Barba" keeps calling.
Why?

14:40.247 --> 14:41.982
- Just my office.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.619
- Surprise.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.058
- Shh.
Careful, your head.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.826
- What the hell, Roxie?
She's untied?

14:53.826 --> 14:55.963
- Look, I was just helping
with the kid.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.998
- They're not going anywhere.

14:57.998 --> 15:03.003
- You pull anything, and you're
never gonna see your son again.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.337
- Oh, you're okay.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.008
- Can I just get them
something to drink?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.742
- Get away from her.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.381
[phone rings]

15:14.381 --> 15:15.648
- Ralph?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.850
- What the hell
is taking so long, man?

15:17.850 --> 15:20.988
- We got the cash from the ATM,
but the mom, she's all upset,

15:20.988 --> 15:22.990
and she wants to talk
to the kids before she goes in.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.724
- No.
No, that's not part of the deal.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.193
She sees them after.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.195
- Give me the phone.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.363
No. Now!
I have to know they're okay.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.565
- What's going on?
- It's under control, Joe.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.367
She just wants proof
that we didn't kill them.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.836
- Proof?
She want to hear them scream?

15:36.836 --> 15:38.405
- I think that's Mommy
on the phone.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.408
- How about you take a photo,
and you send it to them

15:41.408 --> 15:43.076
if you want the money?

15:43.076 --> 15:46.279
- Smile!

15:46.279 --> 15:48.848
[shutter clicks]

15:48.848 --> 15:51.418
Now get the cash,
or they're dead.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.585
[doorbell rings]

15:52.585 --> 15:53.886
- Who's that?
- [sighs]

15:53.886 --> 15:55.188
- Why don't you
let me answer it?

15:55.188 --> 15:56.689
Whoever it is,
I will get rid of them.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.458
- No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.294
She goes!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.463
You love him, right?

16:03.463 --> 16:04.764
One wrong move,

16:04.764 --> 16:07.667
and it's lights out
for your little bro.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.336
[doorbell rings]

16:17.144 --> 16:18.578
- I'm not supposed
to open the door.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.047
- It's okay,
we're truant officers.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.448
- Yeah, we're with
the Board of Ed.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.815
You and your brother
weren't at school today.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.152
- We're both sick.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.320
- Okay, can we talk
to your mom and dad?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.921
- They're not home.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.261
I got to go.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.964
- GPS says
Liv's still inside.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.067
- That girl was not okay.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.573
- They're gone, Joe.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.409
- We're jacked.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.845
They were cops.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.247
What the hell
did you say to them?

16:54.247 --> 16:57.084
- Nothing, I just told him
Luca and I were sick.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.719
- Listen to me; they may have
figured out that I'm here,

16:59.719 --> 17:02.455
so their next move
is to call for backup.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.791
Now is the time
for you guys to go.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.659
- You just need
to stop talking.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.762
- You know, maybe
we should listen to her.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.498
Babe, come on.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.499
We need to get
out of here.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.402
Come on.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.570
- Look at her.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.106
She's a cop.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.007
Everything that she says
is a lie.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.110
Everything that she says
is a trap.

17:26.012 --> 17:28.315
- There's no perimeter here.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.150
I'm telling you.
Look out.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.152
Look for yourself.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.122
There's no perimeter.
Okay?

17:35.122 --> 17:38.791
Slip out the back before they
figure out who you are.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.633
- We're not going anywhere
until we get the money.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.268
You got that?

17:48.268 --> 17:51.271
[dramatic music]

17:51.271 --> 17:59.312
*

18:01.148 --> 18:02.982
- Chief Gabriel?

18:05.152 --> 18:07.154
Mike Dodds.
Where are we?

18:07.154 --> 18:08.521
- We have a level one
going on.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.223
The precinct has the area
in lockdown.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.192
Everyone in the line of fire
has been evacuated,

18:12.192 --> 18:14.227
and everyone else has been told
to shelter in place.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.628
- Di you call
into the house yet?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.930
- We're waiting
for hostage negotiation.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.467
- Chief?
- Captain Sasso, pole cams up?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.435
- Up and running.
We see two armed suspects.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.371
White male, about 40,
and a younger white female.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.072
- What about Benson?

18:26.072 --> 18:28.275
- She's inside with a teenage
girl and a younger boy.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.809
- That's Tess
and her brother, Luca.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.211
- Everyone seems
to be sequestered

18:31.211 --> 18:32.279
in a second floor bedroom.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.480
- Okay, what about the parents?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.081
Richard owns Crivello's
grocery chain.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.416
He was MIA
from work today.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.817
Lisa's a stay-at-home mom.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.552
- No visual yet.
I'll work other angles.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.587
- All right.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.258
- Dammit.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.994
Dammit.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.597
- We should have gone.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.898
They're gonna kill us.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.501
- Let Richard go.
Let the kids go.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.436
You keep me.
I'm your best asset.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.571
- And where's your stupid-ass
brother, Roxie?

18:58.571 --> 19:01.374
- I don't know, Joe.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.810
He should've been back
by now.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.213
I mean, what are we doing here?
What's our plan?

19:06.213 --> 19:07.847
- Shut up!
- What's our play?

19:07.847 --> 19:10.217
- What's our plan?
Just let me think!

19:10.217 --> 19:14.387
Let me think, okay?

19:14.387 --> 19:16.256
Hey.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.558
Yeah, you.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.327
You're gonna get us
out of here.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.896
You're gonna call them
and tell them to stand down.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.232
- They won't, Joe.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.367
- Oh, you don't think
I'm serious?

19:27.367 --> 19:29.702
How about I shove this gun
down her throat?

19:29.702 --> 19:31.338
- [whimpers]
- Open your mouth.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.241
- Okay, okay.
No need for that.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.675
Give me my phone.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.811
I'm gonna call
my sergeant, okay?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.515
- Speaker on.
- Okay.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.351
- No secrets.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.753
[phone buzzes]

19:46.753 --> 19:48.621
- Hey, it's Benson.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.258
- They're still setting up
the secure line.

19:51.258 --> 19:54.026
Record this.
Dodds, it's just you.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.295
Go.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.063
- Dodds.
- Dodds, it's Benson here.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.798
We're all okay.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.101
- I want the cameras down
and the snipers to back away.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.271
- Joe wants the snipers
to back away

20:04.271 --> 20:06.373
and the cameras disabled.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.808
- Okay.
Okay, we can do that.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.710
A negotiator's en route.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.046
In the meantime,
is everybody okay?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.048
- A negotiator?

20:16.048 --> 20:18.418
A pizza for a hostage?

20:18.418 --> 20:20.620
- They just want to talk.
- Yeah, I know what that means.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.255
Talk, talk, talk.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.760
- Get away from the window.
Come on.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.796
- Joe...

20:29.796 --> 20:32.332
You're holding a family

20:32.332 --> 20:35.635
and a police officer hostage.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.170
If you don't talk to them,

20:38.170 --> 20:40.239
they're gonna burst in here,

20:40.239 --> 20:42.174
and they're gonna
take you out,

20:42.174 --> 20:44.744
and they're gonna
take Roxie out.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.779
That's just where we are.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.619
- Joe.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.723
- Fine.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.932
Who at the NYPD do you trust?

21:05.932 --> 21:08.368
- My squad.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.402
My detectives.

21:09.402 --> 21:13.139
- No.
Someone with more pull.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.177
Someone that cares about you.

21:18.177 --> 21:21.748
Is there anyone
at the NYPD

21:33.393 --> 21:33.526
.

21:34.260 --> 21:34.894
- Any change
in the situation?

21:35.728 --> 21:36.729
- No, Captain.

21:36.729 --> 21:37.797
The hostage taker
told Benson

21:37.797 --> 21:39.165
he's waiting
for you to arrive.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.033
- Okay, I need to know
everything you've told him.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.202
- We agreed to pull back ESU,
turn off the cameras,

21:43.202 --> 21:44.604
and get you here;
that's it.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.639
- Also, this guy sounded
pretty hopped up to me.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.240
- Like on drugs?
- Mm.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.543
- Great, his emotions are up
and he's high.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.379
Not much room
for rational thinking.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.380
- Nope, not much.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.647
- Captain Tucker?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.383
I'm Chief Gabriel,
incident commander.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.484
ESU's set.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.852
Hostage negotiation team
can walk you through this.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.154
- I'm all right.
I was on the team before IAB.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.823
I take the refresher
twice a year.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.528
- Okay.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.763
I think we're good.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.303
What happened
to your friend, huh?

22:17.303 --> 22:19.472
The one with the juice?

22:19.472 --> 22:20.473
Where is he?

22:20.473 --> 22:22.675
- He's gonna be here,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.877
and when he gets here,
he's gonna want to know

22:24.877 --> 22:27.480
how everyone is doing, so...

22:27.480 --> 22:33.420
So would you let me
just check on Richard?

22:33.420 --> 22:35.054
Roxie could go with me.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.924
- This is all your fault.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.526
If anyone dies...

22:39.526 --> 22:41.293
- No one is gonna die, okay?

22:41.293 --> 22:42.294
She's gonna get her guy,

22:42.294 --> 22:43.663
and then we're gonna
get out of here.

22:43.663 --> 22:47.333
- And what about your
idiot for a brother, Roxie?

22:47.333 --> 22:48.501
Huh?

22:48.501 --> 22:51.203
- You know, this whole place
is surrounded,

22:51.203 --> 22:52.772
so if he saw a cop...

22:52.772 --> 22:55.808
[phone ringing]

22:59.812 --> 23:00.813
- [laughs]

23:00.813 --> 23:03.916
[phone ringing]

23:05.284 --> 23:08.521
Answer on speaker.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.024
Now.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.225
- Benson.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.628
You're on speaker,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.830
and Joe is here with me.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.700
- It's Tucker.
Everyone okay?

23:20.700 --> 23:25.037
- Joe and Roxie
are taking good care of us.

23:25.037 --> 23:28.307
The children are unharmed,

23:28.307 --> 23:31.678
and the father's injuries

23:31.678 --> 23:34.714
are under control.

23:34.714 --> 23:35.748
- I see.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.084
And how about Lisa,
the mother?

23:42.288 --> 23:44.390
- You say that she's here.

23:44.390 --> 23:48.027
- And if he wants
to talk to her?

23:48.027 --> 23:50.396
Joe...

23:50.396 --> 23:53.032
if he thinks that I'm lying,

23:53.032 --> 23:55.568
he's gonna get nervous.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.269
You don't want that.

24:00.973 --> 24:05.377
- Don't say a thing
about the bank.

24:05.377 --> 24:08.515
- She's not here right now,

24:08.515 --> 24:09.982
but she will be back soon.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.150
- Is she okay?

24:11.150 --> 24:12.218
- They let the mother
go out on her own?

24:12.218 --> 24:13.352
- No way.

24:13.352 --> 24:14.654
There's a third hostage taker.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.388
They're making a bank run.
- Which bank?

24:16.388 --> 24:18.390
There's one on every corner
in this neighborhood.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.626
- We'll check their financials.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.293
- I'll lock down every bank
in the zip code.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.095
- I got a photo of the mother.
I'll text it out.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.997
- Let us know if you get
anything on the third guy.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.800
- I see.
And Joe is there with you?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.269
- Yes, he is.
He can hear you.

24:30.269 --> 24:33.305
- Hey, Joe.
This is Captain Tucker.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.642
You can call me Ed.
Everything all right?

24:35.642 --> 24:37.143
- What do you think, Ed?

24:37.143 --> 24:39.311
I got a gun to your cop.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.647
No tricks.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.649
- Joe, I am listening to you.

24:42.649 --> 24:46.018
I am, and I know how stressful
this is for you,

24:46.018 --> 24:47.820
and I want you to know,
I've done this a lot more

24:47.820 --> 24:50.022
than you have,
so I can get you out of this.

24:51.924 --> 24:55.628
- Tell him.
- Okay, Tucker?

24:55.628 --> 24:57.997
Joe has some things
that he needs.

25:02.068 --> 25:06.739
- I want an SUV
with tinted windows--

25:06.739 --> 25:10.342
no driver,
can't be rigged--

25:10.342 --> 25:13.345
and I want a million dollars
in cash.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.347
- He's asking for a car, Tucker.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.883
- Yeah, absolutely.
I'm getting this.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.785
Transportation and money--
is that right, Joe?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.219
- I'm not finished.

25:20.219 --> 25:25.191
I want the streets
to a helipad cleared,

25:25.191 --> 25:28.928
all the traffic blocked
like I'm the freakin' pope,

25:28.928 --> 25:31.964
and then I want a helicopter
standing by,

25:31.964 --> 25:36.235
and then, I want a CJ4 jet,
fully fueled--

25:36.235 --> 25:39.471
no pilot,
because I can fly.

25:39.471 --> 25:44.076
- Well, the truth is,
it's gonna take some time, bud.

25:44.076 --> 25:47.614
- You tell them, or else...

25:47.614 --> 25:49.949
- Okay.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.250
Tucker?

25:51.250 --> 25:53.085
Joe's not playing around.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.688
- I understand
Joe's not playing around.

25:55.688 --> 25:58.257
Okay, we will get
all these things in motion, Joe,

25:58.257 --> 25:59.726
but how about,
as an act of good faith,

25:59.726 --> 26:01.628
you release the kids?

26:01.628 --> 26:04.530
- How about I don't shoot them
right this second?

26:04.530 --> 26:06.633
Huh?

26:06.633 --> 26:08.400
There's your good faith.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.007
- Tucker, ESU says
they have the building covered.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.442
They're ready to go inside.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.644
- I'm sure they are,

26:17.644 --> 26:19.211
but this doesn't need
to get tactical yet.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.546
He's making demands,
which means

26:20.546 --> 26:21.848
he's looking
toward the future.

26:21.848 --> 26:23.249
He wants to live.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.817
- The mom just made a withdrawal
from an ATM.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.452
Fin and Carisi are on their way.

26:32.558 --> 26:33.893
- Hey, sorry for the wait,

26:33.893 --> 26:35.127
but Trish had to
step upstairs for a sec.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.195
- We've been ready to go
forever.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.196
Now let us out of here.
- No problem.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.931
Right this way.
Down on the ground!

26:38.931 --> 26:41.167
Now!
On the ground!

26:41.167 --> 26:42.835
- No! Stop!

26:42.835 --> 26:44.270
- You're safe.
Come on, let's go.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.337
- Gun!

26:47.273 --> 26:48.675
- Did Joe give me up?

26:48.675 --> 26:50.142
He's the one
who made me do this.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.144
- All right, listen to me.
Joe's not your friend right now.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.479
I am.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.247
That's why you got to tell me
everything you can

26:55.247 --> 26:58.350
about what's going on
inside that house.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.385
- Ralph Volkov.

26:59.385 --> 27:00.920
Assault, drunk driving.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.689
Fired by Crivello's
grocery chain

27:02.689 --> 27:04.156
after two
failed drug tests.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.324
- A revenge plan?

27:05.324 --> 27:07.026
But he's not the ringleader?

27:07.026 --> 27:09.395
- No.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.697
- Yeah, this was his idea.

27:10.697 --> 27:11.964
I didn't--
I didn't want to hurt them.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.232
We just--
we needed the money.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.466
- Hello, Ralph.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.068
I'm Assistant
District Attorney Rafael Barba.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.370
So who's "we"?

27:18.370 --> 27:19.706
- Me and my sister Roxie.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.809
Our--our mother,
she--she needs a new hip.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.476
She can hardly walk.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.178
- Roxie's the one
in the house now?

27:26.178 --> 27:28.715
- Yeah, but she didn't want
to hurt anyone either.

27:28.715 --> 27:29.716
That's all on Joe.

27:29.716 --> 27:30.883
- Uh-huh.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.452
Joe's his real name?

27:33.452 --> 27:34.520
Ralph?

27:34.520 --> 27:37.023
Ralph, look at me.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.959
Anybody dies in there, you're
on the hook for felony murder.

27:39.959 --> 27:44.731
You help us, or you're gone.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.298
- Joe's his real name.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.735
Joe Utley.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.837
- They wouldn't stop hitting
my husband.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.404
He was bleeding from the head
for hours.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.006
- Well, head wounds
tend to bleed a lot.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.075
Usually looks a lot worse
than it is, okay?

27:56.075 --> 27:58.745
Now, can you tell me how many
guns they had inside?

27:58.745 --> 28:02.248
- Oh, I'm not sure,
but they each had a gun.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.751
- Pistols?
- Yes, three pistols.

28:04.751 --> 28:09.155
And Joe had, like,
a machine gun or something.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.890
- Did Lieutenant Benson
have a gun on her?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.624
- They took it away.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.293
You've got to let me
back in there.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.162
I promised them
I'd bring the money,

28:16.162 --> 28:17.629
and I need to see my kids.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.098
- Okay.
- They're okay, right?

28:19.098 --> 28:21.901
- I mean, they were
half an hour ago.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.770
- You sure of that?
- Yes.

28:23.770 --> 28:24.971
Before going into the bank,

28:24.971 --> 28:27.106
I made them send a photo
to Ralph's phone.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.677
- This photo--this
the last time you had contact

28:31.677 --> 28:32.945
with Joe and Roxie?

28:32.945 --> 28:34.013
- Yeah, man.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.347
- Good, we may need you
to call him.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.849
- No, he's gonna be mad at me.

28:36.849 --> 28:39.852
- Hey, this your buddy
right here?

28:39.852 --> 28:41.453
- That's Joe,
but he's not my buddy.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.089
- Joe Utley,
dishonorably discharged

28:43.089 --> 28:44.290
from Special Forces.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.825
They sent him down
for the war on drugs.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.259
He ended up switching sides.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.928
- Joe's about to call Ralph.
That's you.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.496
- Yeah, but this wasn't my idea.

28:50.496 --> 28:51.898
[phone buzzes]
- Play along.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.665
Tell him you have the money,
and to ask the negotiator

28:53.665 --> 28:55.401
to let you two hook up safely.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.436
- I don't think
I should get involved.

28:57.436 --> 29:00.272
- Let me ask you something, man.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.808
[phone buzzing]

29:01.808 --> 29:03.943
You ever want to see your sister
alive again?

29:03.943 --> 29:06.979
[phone buzzing]

29:13.119 --> 29:14.120
- Hey, Joe.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.888
- Ralph, where the hell are you?

29:15.888 --> 29:18.624
Huh?
You got the cash?

29:18.624 --> 29:21.527
- Yeah, I got it.
I got it right here.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.963
- Good.
The cops know we're inside.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.298
Get back here
and tell them to let you in.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.834
- House is surrounded, man.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.836
- Just do it, Ralph.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.038
The cops will let you in.

29:32.038 --> 29:35.141
- Uh...

29:35.141 --> 29:37.443
I can't.
They got me.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.211
- Son of a bitch!

29:39.211 --> 29:40.712
Your brother!

29:40.712 --> 29:42.314
They got him.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.417
- Who?
The cops?

29:45.417 --> 29:46.618
Is he okay?

29:46.618 --> 29:48.855
- I'm not really concerned
about him right now.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.857
- Well, I am.

29:50.857 --> 29:51.958
Are we gonna get him back?

29:51.958 --> 29:54.226
[phone buzzing]

29:54.226 --> 29:55.862
You're gonna get him back,
right, Joe?

29:55.862 --> 29:58.297
[phone ringing, buzzing]

29:58.297 --> 30:02.334
You gonna answer that?

30:02.334 --> 30:04.003
Answer one of them!

30:04.003 --> 30:05.437
- Shut up!

30:05.437 --> 30:06.805
What?

30:06.805 --> 30:08.440
- Hey, Joe. It's Ed.
Can you hear me?

30:08.440 --> 30:10.342
I'm here with Ralph.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.244
- Yeah, well, I want Ralph,

30:12.244 --> 30:14.847
and I want the cash here, now.

30:14.847 --> 30:20.519
You lie again, and your
pretty little girlfriend dies.

30:20.519 --> 30:23.455
- Joe, no one can make you kill
anybody if you don't want to.

30:29.996 --> 30:33.799
- He really wants Ralph
in here, now.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.269
- Yeah, I understand that,

30:37.269 --> 30:40.506
but that's not something
we can do right now.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.674
- He's telling you the truth.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.277
We're not allowed
to send civilians inside.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.147
- Okay.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.181
Then I'm done talking.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.050
- Joe, listen to me.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.451
ESU is all over this block.

30:52.451 --> 30:53.652
Do you know who they are?

30:53.652 --> 30:55.687
- Yeah, Ed.
They're like SWAT.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.822
- Exactly.

30:56.822 --> 30:58.490
You stop talking to me,

30:58.490 --> 31:00.526
they pull me away,
and those guys take over.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.734
- Let me talk to Ralph.

31:11.637 --> 31:14.540
- I can't go in, Joe.
They got snipers.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.408
- You're an idiot.

31:16.408 --> 31:19.946
He said that he could do this,
that he could get the money.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.313
This is your fault.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.482
You said that
he was good for this.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.251
- You should have gone, okay?

31:25.251 --> 31:26.718
Don't blame this on him!

31:26.718 --> 31:28.254
This is your fault.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.488
Okay, that guy in there?

31:29.488 --> 31:31.457
He's not doing so great.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.325
Okay?
He's gonna die, okay?

31:33.325 --> 31:34.860
[screams]

31:46.072 --> 31:48.274
- Everybody okay?

31:48.274 --> 31:50.576
- Okay.

31:50.576 --> 31:54.446
So we know that Ralph's
not coming in here,

31:54.446 --> 31:56.815
but do you have his money?

31:56.815 --> 31:57.816
- Good idea.

31:57.816 --> 31:59.118
Joe, let's make another deal.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.620
We'll give you the $50,000
Ralph got.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.522
- There we go.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.691
- I got bonds, too, Joe,
from the safety deposit box.

32:05.691 --> 32:08.427
- Those, too.
The money, the bonds...

32:08.427 --> 32:10.196
You give us the kids.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.698
A trade for a trade.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.000
- Yeah.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.734
Oh, come on, Joe.

32:19.705 --> 32:23.175
Okay.
Okay.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.544
Joe's on board.

32:38.024 --> 32:38.124
.

32:38.857 --> 32:39.558
- You made
the right choice, Joe.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.228
I have your money.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.530
There's two EMTs standing by
to take Richard out of there.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.332
No guns, no tricks.
I promise.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.169
- What are they wearing?

32:56.075 --> 32:59.111
- They're wearing
EMT uniforms.

32:59.111 --> 33:02.614
- How do I know
that they're not carrying?

33:02.614 --> 33:06.052
I want both those guys
to strip down, now.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.653
- They're not carrying, Joe.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.289
- Bull.
Make them strip.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.058
- All right,
but they keep their vests on.

33:12.058 --> 33:15.627
- Oh, that's fine.
But what about my car, huh?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.829
Is the helicopter ready?

33:17.829 --> 33:19.498
The plane?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.133
- We're working on all of that,
Joe, okay?

33:21.133 --> 33:23.335
We just need more time.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.337
Stand by.
He wants you to strip.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.377
- The money is all there.

33:31.377 --> 33:34.080
- And what about
my car?

33:34.080 --> 33:37.516
- They told me to tell you
it's on its way,

33:37.516 --> 33:40.086
and so is the helicopter.

33:40.086 --> 33:43.089
- How do I know
you're not lying?

33:43.089 --> 33:47.859
- If they say that it's coming,
it's coming.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.528
- Fine.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.097
Get him out of here.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.838
Wait.

33:59.838 --> 34:02.941
The vests--take them off.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.019
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

34:14.019 --> 34:15.421
- How's it look in there?

34:15.421 --> 34:17.456
- It's not good.
- Liv okay?

34:17.456 --> 34:19.591
- She's okay.
- Joe?

34:19.591 --> 34:20.992
I want to thank you.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.594
It was good getting Richard
out of there.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.929
Now we're onto the next step,
okay?

34:23.929 --> 34:25.197
The car's pulling up.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.638
- It's there, Joe.

34:32.638 --> 34:36.142
- Next, I'm gonna send someone
out to check the car.

34:36.142 --> 34:40.479
I want the keys in the ignition,
engine running,

34:40.479 --> 34:43.715
and I want
all those ESU guys gone.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.151
You hear me?

34:45.151 --> 34:48.220
I want a clear path!

34:48.220 --> 34:50.156
Hey, boss lady,

34:50.156 --> 34:53.559
why don't you put
this vest on Roxie?

34:53.559 --> 34:55.594
- Okay.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.640
[whispering]
Roxie,

35:08.640 --> 35:11.443
you don't have to do this.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.279
They have your brother.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.080
He's safe.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.216
This is your chance.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.885
You go out there,
and you don't come back.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.920
I know you don't
want to die.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.289
- How do you know?

35:23.289 --> 35:26.192
- All you have to do
is drop to your knees

35:26.192 --> 35:28.427
and put your hands up.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.595
- Just shut up.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.263
Just shut up.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.199
Buckle me in.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.503
- Here she comes.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.205
- Everyone hold fire.

36:06.232 --> 36:08.767
- Yeah, everything's clear, Joe.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.135
[gasps]

36:15.241 --> 36:16.975
- Get back in here.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.713
Roxie?

36:23.014 --> 36:24.550
What is taking so long?

36:24.550 --> 36:25.984
Roxie?

36:25.984 --> 36:26.985
What are you doing?

36:26.985 --> 36:28.287
What's going on out there?

36:28.287 --> 36:29.955
- She's still at the car, Joe.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.757
- Get in here.
Let's go!

36:35.060 --> 36:36.962
Roxie?

36:45.904 --> 36:48.139
- I'm--I'm sorry, Joe.

36:51.277 --> 36:52.711
- Hey, hold up.
She's surrendering.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.080
[shaky breathing]

36:56.147 --> 36:57.483
- We got her.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.285
- Get her over here.

36:59.285 --> 37:02.321
[quick breathing]

37:04.189 --> 37:06.625
- Damn you.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.827
- Take it easy.

37:17.336 --> 37:17.469
.

37:18.169 --> 37:18.904
- I didn't tell her
anything, Joe.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.407
- Agh!

37:21.407 --> 37:23.309
[screams]

37:23.309 --> 37:26.144
I'm sick of you
lying to me!

37:26.144 --> 37:27.178
- Ow!

37:28.980 --> 37:31.317
Joe, listen to me.

37:31.317 --> 37:33.819
This is better for you.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.187
You don't need her.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.056
We're so close.

37:38.056 --> 37:41.159
We're so close
to getting out of here.

37:41.159 --> 37:44.195
[phone ringing]

37:45.597 --> 37:49.668
You tell Tucker
how we're gonna do this.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.737
Your terms, Joe.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.171
Your terms.

37:53.171 --> 37:55.040
[phone ringing]

37:55.040 --> 37:56.408
- Hey, Joe?

37:56.408 --> 37:57.876
You got what you wanted now.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.846
The money, the car, the chopper,
the plane...

38:00.846 --> 38:03.081
but now
I'm gonna need something.

38:03.081 --> 38:05.784
The kids, Joe.
Okay?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.519
- No.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.755
We're all going
out of here together,

38:09.755 --> 38:13.859
and if anything happens,
everyone's gonna die with me.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.861
End of negotiations.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.863
- I've kept my side.

38:17.863 --> 38:21.600
We're gonna need
at least one kid.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.101
- Fine.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.970
When I get into the car,

38:24.970 --> 38:28.840
I'll give you the little kid,

38:28.840 --> 38:30.876
but I'm keeping my girls.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.683
[Tess crying]

38:40.819 --> 38:42.821
They're taking me out,
aren't they?

38:45.724 --> 38:49.395
- You keep your gun to my head,

38:49.395 --> 38:52.998
and they're not gonna try
to beat your trigger squeeze.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.666
That, I know for a fact.

38:57.135 --> 38:59.170
- So we're not letting him
drive out of here.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.172
Nobody shoots till
I give you the green light.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.409
- Hold on, Chief, okay?
He's lost his girl.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.611
He comes out, he sees
massive PD presence...

39:05.611 --> 39:07.546
Maybe we ask him
to lay down.

39:07.546 --> 39:08.814
- What?
Take a knee?

39:08.814 --> 39:10.449
That's not your call, Tucker.

39:10.449 --> 39:11.817
Thanks for your help.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.452
You keep him talking
as long as you can,

39:13.452 --> 39:15.987
but ESU's got this now.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.489
Is that clear?

39:19.425 --> 39:21.827
- Okay, Joe, just keep your gun
to my head.

39:21.827 --> 39:25.431
- Oh, you're not gonna
have to worry about that.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.433
Now, let's go.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.670
- They're coming
out of the garden level.

39:31.670 --> 39:34.673
[suspenseful music]

39:34.673 --> 39:42.714
*

39:44.516 --> 39:46.251
- We're gonna go up the steps.
Nice and slow.

39:46.251 --> 39:48.887
- Okay.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.922
- Hold your fire!

39:53.759 --> 39:55.694
- It's okay, honey.
We're almost there.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.168
You're doing great, guys.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.471
It's okay.
Nice and easy.

40:05.471 --> 40:08.206
- Get back!

40:08.206 --> 40:10.041
Move!

40:10.041 --> 40:12.077
Get back!
Now!

40:12.077 --> 40:13.479
Farther back!

40:14.613 --> 40:15.981
- Wait for the green light.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.382
[safety clicks]

40:18.717 --> 40:20.385
- The kids are going
in the back of the car.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.521
- You know, Joe...

40:22.521 --> 40:24.355
Joe, we don't really--

40:24.355 --> 40:26.625
we don't really
need the kids anymore,

40:26.625 --> 40:27.659
right?

40:27.659 --> 40:29.360
You keep your gun on me.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.530
Why don't we let the kids go?

40:31.530 --> 40:34.165
And just make it
about you and me, Joe.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.834
I'm all you need.

40:35.834 --> 40:39.638
You and me.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.840
Go...

40:41.840 --> 40:43.241
go.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.511
- He's letting both kids go!

40:45.511 --> 40:47.412
- Okay, that's great, Joe.
Come on.

40:47.412 --> 40:48.747
- Thank you, Joe.
- All right, come on.

40:48.747 --> 40:49.748
Come on.
Keep going.

40:49.748 --> 40:52.217
Keep going,
keep going.

40:52.217 --> 40:53.585
- Get in.
- Okay.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.086
I'm getting in.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.789
I'm just gonna let Tucker
know the plan, okay?

40:57.789 --> 40:59.991
- No, I'm gonna tell Tucker--

40:59.991 --> 41:02.060
- Take him out!

41:02.060 --> 41:03.729
- Lieutenant!

41:03.729 --> 41:05.330
- Secure his weapon!

41:05.330 --> 41:06.765
- I got it!
- You all right?

41:06.765 --> 41:08.399
- Come on.
Come on.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.701
- It's over.
- I'm okay.

41:09.701 --> 41:12.337
- If you say so.

41:12.337 --> 41:14.072
- He was dead
before he hit the ground.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.140
- Where's Noah?
- We'll bring him.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.141
- But where is he?

41:16.141 --> 41:17.175
- Okay, he's
with Lucy right now.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.343
We're gonna find him
for you, okay?

41:18.343 --> 41:19.711
- Lieutenant, just
take care of yourself first.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.012
- Okay.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.280
Tucker...

41:24.750 --> 41:25.751
Thank you.

41:25.751 --> 41:27.352
- For what?

41:27.352 --> 41:29.354
