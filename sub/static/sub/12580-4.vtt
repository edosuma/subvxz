""Russian hand-cranked flashlight""?

00:40.073 --> 00:43.770
Nancy Drew books?
What kind of hardware store is this?

00:44.077 --> 00:46.705
Dad! The world's best hammer!

00:47.047 --> 00:49.982
Sears already sold me
the world's best hammer...

00:50.083 --> 00:51.778
so someone's lying.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.276
[Cash register beeping]

00:54.387 --> 00:57.049
I say we just get him a gift certificate.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.647
That's a great idea, Bobby.

00:58.792 --> 01:02.091
We will give your father,
who worked so hard to conceive you...

01:02.195 --> 01:05.631
the same thing we give the paperboy,
who did nothing.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.462
I'm lucky. Cotton is so easy to shop for.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.901
Either he likes what I get him
and he's happy...

01:12.005 --> 01:15.031
or he hates it and he shoots it
and he's happy.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.870
It's the first Christmas dinner
in my new apartment...

01:18.978 --> 01:22.106
so you better bring a Christmas gift,
a housewarming gift...

01:22.215 --> 01:24.080
and a chair if you want to sit.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.448
No problem. I've got some that fold.

01:26.553 --> 01:28.316
Now, how about I buy you an ornament?

01:29.489 --> 01:32.287
A ""Peace""?
You would like that, you draft dodger!

01:32.392 --> 01:35.054
Sure you can't find one
with a flag burning on it?

01:35.161 --> 01:37.686
It's Jesus peace, not hippie peace.

01:37.797 --> 01:40.357
Either way,
we've always been a ""Joy"" family.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.798
-But--
-Joy!

01:42.969 --> 01:44.197
[Beeping]

01:46.172 --> 01:47.161
I gotta go, Dad.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.003
There's a propane emergency
at the police station.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.078
Oh, everyone out of the way.

01:52.178 --> 01:54.544
The assistant lackey's on the move.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.046
Never been promoted.

01:56.149 --> 01:58.709
I'm proud to serve as assistant manager...

01:58.818 --> 02:01.582
and Buck will promote me
when I'm good and ready.

02:03.990 --> 02:08.187
Hank Hill, Strickland Propane,
responding to the propane emergency.

02:09.461 --> 02:10.860
There's your emergency.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.954
HANK: Mr. Strickland?

02:13.333 --> 02:15.028
How did you get locked in there?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.898
DWl, Hank.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.561
Blew a 0.2.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.333
It was just a couple of....
Three, three eggnogs.

02:21.441 --> 02:24.672
Hell, that shouldn't count,
seeing as how it's Christmas and all.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.905
But why would you call in
a false propane emergency?

02:28.014 --> 02:31.450
We're looking at a $50 fine
once I report us.

02:31.551 --> 02:34.349
Well, I needed a sober ride, Hank.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.580
They took away my license.

02:36.990 --> 02:41.757
Who wants to buy propane
from some no-license castrato?

02:41.861 --> 02:45.353
Tell you what, sir.
Why don't you let me drive you around?

02:45.465 --> 02:48.593
I like to drive, you like to sit.
Everybody wins.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.163
You drive nice, Hank.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.640
I pretend the gas pedal's an egg.

02:57.443 --> 02:58.432
Pull over.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.309
Now I remember
where I was going last night.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.180
Yep. Douglas makes a good fir.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.089
-This is your tree.
-She's a beaut, Hank.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.996
How are you fixed for ornaments?

03:22.001 --> 03:23.468
""Peace,"" huh?

03:26.372 --> 03:29.068
Thanks again for the tree, Mr. Strickland.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.803
Of course, in a way,
every year you buy me a tree.

03:31.911 --> 03:32.878
[Laughing]

03:33.846 --> 03:35.473
You know, the paychecks.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.743
No, it's the least I can do.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.444
You may be driving me all over creation.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.521
The judge says
I ain't getting my license back...

03:42.622 --> 03:44.556
till I do my community service.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.955
Gotta build some house for Jimmy Carter.

03:47.093 --> 03:50.290
You get to build
a Habitat for Humanity house...

03:50.396 --> 03:51.693
for driving drunk?

03:51.798 --> 03:54.733
I've been on the waiting list for two years.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.500
I tell you what, Old Top.

03:57.604 --> 04:02.303
How would you like it if I made you
assistant manager of building this house?

04:02.408 --> 04:03.773
You mean it?

04:03.910 --> 04:07.311
-Well, thank you, sir.
-[Laughing] No, I thank you.

04:08.982 --> 04:13.214
And, long story short, Mr. Strickland
tells me I can build the house.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.843
He did not!

04:14.954 --> 04:17.387
He did, Bill. Why would I make it up?

04:17.890 --> 04:20.916
I don't know.
Sometimes I lie to get attention.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.619
-You want to help me or not?
-Yeah, man.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.527
-Yeah!
-Wingo!

04:25.632 --> 04:28.863
I'd like to volunteer
to be in charge of booby traps.

04:28.968 --> 04:32.199
-There will be no booby traps, Dale.
-What?

04:32.672 --> 04:35.505
Oh, right. Got you, Hank.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.607
No booby traps.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.947
Groundbreaking's day after tomorrow.

04:42.048 --> 04:45.074
I wish I could go to bed right now
and wake up in two days...

04:45.184 --> 04:46.708
with a shovel in my hand.

04:46.819 --> 04:48.787
-Mom!
-Shovel for Christmas.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.913
You know what? I'm too excited to eat.

04:51.024 --> 04:54.824
I think I'll grab one of my shovels
and practice on Bill's yard.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.155
[Doorbell ringing]

04:58.498 --> 05:01.695
Come on, Hank.
Let's go shoot us a Christmas tree.

05:01.801 --> 05:05.601
Well, Dad, you know how much I love
to yell, ""Ready, aim, timber""...

05:05.705 --> 05:08.731
but this year
Mr. Strickland bought me a tree.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.402
But we always....

05:13.046 --> 05:17.506
Only a man with a narrow urethra
would think that skinny stick was a tree.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.019
Too bad we can't get Dad
a new dad for Christmas.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.419
Or can we?

05:24.724 --> 05:28.717
Bobby, I have turned your terrible idea
into a brilliant one.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.826
The best present for your father...

05:30.930 --> 05:33.364
would be
a healthy relationship with his father...

05:33.466 --> 05:36.367
one where they can express
their real feelings for each other.

05:36.469 --> 05:39.905
And, conveniently,
I can get the same thing for Cotton.

05:40.039 --> 05:43.167
Didi gets her bath gel like always,
and I'm done.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.975
-Can I put my name on it?
-I'll put your name on it.

05:47.547 --> 05:48.809
[Grunting]

05:49.716 --> 05:53.379
Hank, why don't you invite
your father to the groundbreaking?

05:53.486 --> 05:55.716
Because I already know his answer.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.847
No, followed by an insult.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.891
Oh, so now you're a psychic.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.893
Oh, Cotton,
Hank has something to tell you.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.197
Did you see that coming?

06:06.766 --> 06:10.258
Dad, if you're not
doing anything Thursday...

06:10.937 --> 06:13.667
well, we're having
this groundbreaking ceremony...

06:13.773 --> 06:17.004
-for this house I'm building for charity.
-Charity?

06:17.110 --> 06:20.045
Only Charity I care about
dances in a G-string.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.943
And I'm spending the day with her.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.449
Well, it's just, you know,
you spent my birthday with her.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.109
I thought maybe....

06:27.220 --> 06:28.915
But.... Okay.

06:33.025 --> 06:35.459
Okay, I'll go. You win.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.056
If I wanted to see a big baby cry...

06:38.164 --> 06:40.598
I'd go home to my baby, crybaby.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.199
[Drilling]

06:47.106 --> 06:49.267
HANK: Okay, I've put together a schedule...

06:49.375 --> 06:52.208
which gives us four days
to finish this house.

06:52.311 --> 06:55.041
The frame's a prefab,
so we could build it in two...

06:55.148 --> 06:58.117
but let's take four and really enjoy it.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.276
Since we're starting from scratch...

07:00.386 --> 07:04.823
why don't we make it a dream house
and put the toilet in the living room?

07:06.726 --> 07:08.956
Oh, Cotton, I am so glad you're here.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.086
If Hank asked me one more time...

07:11.197 --> 07:13.722
""Where's Cotton?
Where's Cotton? Where's....""

07:13.833 --> 07:15.596
Well, here's Cotton!

07:15.701 --> 07:17.293
Brought my bayonet.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.871
Figured if it was
good enough to kill 50 men...

07:19.972 --> 07:22.031
it's good enough to slice some dry wall.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.403
Well, gosh, Dad.

07:23.509 --> 07:26.342
I know you were saving that
for when they unfroze Hitler.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.970
-Yeah, well, l--
-Hey, Buck.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.640
I saved the best nail pouch for you.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.509
So, this is gonna be Arlen Pines.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.350
Didn't recognize the place
without all the tombstones.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.087
[Grunting]

07:42.295 --> 07:45.025
Hey, hey! Hey!
Them people are stealing your tools!

07:45.131 --> 07:47.759
Oh, that's Alla and Niefko Lubecki.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.160
You're building this house for them.
I know they'd love to meet you.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.870
And don't worry, sir.
You'll be back behind the wheel...

07:56.976 --> 08:00.139
as soon as I finish
repaying your debt to society.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.941
Thanks, Hank. You really pulled
my eggs out the frying pan.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.508
All right, listen, people.
I got a announcement to make.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.145
I'm not one to give credit
where credit is due...

08:10.256 --> 08:13.157
but doggone it,
this time I just can't help myself.

08:13.259 --> 08:17.593
Hank Hill has been my assistant manager
for 20 years.

08:17.997 --> 08:22.263
In all that time I've had two wives,
dozens of mistresses...

08:22.368 --> 08:24.996
five heart valves, three plastic, two pig...

08:25.104 --> 08:27.436
but I only needed one Hank.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.937
Merry Christmas, Hank.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.806
I'm promoting you to manager.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.945
Manager?

08:36.982 --> 08:39.008
Mr. Strickland, l....

08:40.453 --> 08:41.852
I love you.

08:43.688 --> 08:44.883
[All gasping]

08:47.293 --> 08:48.385
[Grunting]

08:52.632 --> 08:56.124
Why did Dad have to act like a woman
in front of Grandpa?

08:56.235 --> 08:57.964
Grandpa hates women.

08:58.070 --> 09:01.130
Your father is going out of his way
to ruin his Christmas present...

09:01.240 --> 09:04.368
so we will have to go out of our way
to save it.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.539
We will make a photo calendar...

09:07.647 --> 09:11.913
each and every month a reminder
of their special father-son bond.

09:12.818 --> 09:14.149
Not happy.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.084
Not happy.

09:16.489 --> 09:19.856
Can't even find one picture
where they're both happy.

09:19.992 --> 09:24.725
Wait. If you splice Grandpa's head
over yours in the wedding photo...

09:24.964 --> 09:28.161
it'll look like Dad and Grandpa
are shaking hands.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.665
And we'll put it on a mug.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.338
[All laughing]

09:34.674 --> 09:37.438
Hey, Hank. We started without you.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.577
-Dang old Hank and Buck, man, that old--
-Now you've gone too far.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.114
Cement is permanent.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.149
As permanent as your love?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.377
Shut up, Dale!

09:48.087 --> 09:49.782
-ls okay?
-No.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.720
Is not okay, Niefko.

09:51.824 --> 09:53.519
My boss demoted me.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.920
I was a manager for 10 seconds...

09:56.028 --> 09:59.725
and all I managed to do was
blurt my guts out like a mental patient.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.429
I don't know where this stuff comes from.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.400
Something must be wrong with me.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.837
Niefko see.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.840
Bad to say those things
one man to other man.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.610
But still, you much to be lucky for.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.579
Texas, USA, police no break down doors...

10:15.681 --> 10:18.411
say, ""Come to Army now! Now you shot! ""

10:18.517 --> 10:21.179
Here, kids walk to school. Is good school.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.687
God bless you,
builders of house and driveway.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.188
God bless America.

10:25.324 --> 10:26.552
[All cheering]

10:46.812 --> 10:48.006
Harley Davidson.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.275
I think so, too, Niefko.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.551
Who would like a hot cup of love?

10:56.355 --> 10:57.344
[Phone ringing]

10:57.456 --> 10:59.424
HANK: Peggy, telephone.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.087
I got it.

11:01.193 --> 11:02.182
Hello?

11:02.294 --> 11:04.489
Well, hello, Mrs, Stricklaid,

11:05.398 --> 11:06.365
[Sighing] Hi, Dad.

11:06.465 --> 11:09.730
I'm just calling to say
you ain't welcome to Christmas dinner.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.063
Good day.

11:12.872 --> 11:15.670
My dad uninvited me for Christmas.

11:15.775 --> 11:16.764
Oh, Hank.

11:16.876 --> 11:20.039
Honey, why don't you call him back
and tell him how that makes you feel?

11:20.146 --> 11:21.670
Absolutely not.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.646
You saw what happened when l...

11:24.784 --> 11:26.581
emoted all over Buck.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.084
No, no. It'll be okay.

11:29.221 --> 11:33.055
We'll just have Christmas dinner
with the Niefkos over at their new house.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.288
Yep. It'll be a great new tradition.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.926
Christmas with the Niefkos.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.365
Didi, we are the wives
of stubborn, stubborn men.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.838
They are lucky to have us, aren't they?

11:48.941 --> 11:50.875
What do you want, Peggy?

11:51.977 --> 11:54.912
I want Cotton to re-invite Hank
to Christmas dinner.

11:55.014 --> 11:58.313
Oh, Cotton will not do that
because Hank is too cruel.

11:59.285 --> 12:03.415
No, Didi, Cotton is the cruel one.
Hank is the one who sells propane.

12:03.522 --> 12:07.583
But Hank is cruel. He said he loved Buck.
He should say he loves Cotton.

12:07.693 --> 12:11.220
And that's not just what I think,
it's what Cotton told me to think.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.991
Cotton is jealous?

12:13.199 --> 12:15.895
But that is a human emotion.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.035
That little four-foot mushball.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.076
Now, I'm not sure if it's the guest
or the man of the house that says grace...

12:25.911 --> 12:28.937
but I got the English, so I'll take the wheel.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.408
[Pounding on door]

12:36.222 --> 12:38.087
-Dad?
-Looking for this?

12:38.457 --> 12:41.722
Well, you told me you left
GH sleeping in a bag of hammers.

12:41.827 --> 12:44.990
How could you trick me like that?
You ain't bright.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.564
Peggy told me how.

12:46.665 --> 12:48.860
Why did you invite my dad here?

12:48.968 --> 12:51.459
You are ruining
our new holiday tradition...

12:51.704 --> 12:53.797
Christmas with the Niefkos.

12:53.939 --> 12:58.069
Cotton, how would you like to stay here
and join us for Christmas dinner?

12:58.177 --> 12:59.371
[Sniffing]

12:59.478 --> 13:01.343
Well, something smells good.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.541
Could be turkey.
Probably fresh particle board.

13:06.919 --> 13:11.219
Well, that is a beautiful story, Colonel,
but not as beautiful as this house.

13:11.323 --> 13:13.917
Don't you think
this house is beautiful, Cotton?

13:15.161 --> 13:16.492
It's okay.

13:16.729 --> 13:20.062
-I like the job you did on the dry wall.
-Well, thanks, Dad.

13:20.166 --> 13:23.033
I took a risk
and went with the National Gypsum...

13:23.135 --> 13:25.433
instead of the Georgia-Pacific.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.130
I hope Buck doesn't mind.

13:27.239 --> 13:28.331
Buck?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.305
Buck! Buck, Buck, Buck!

13:30.876 --> 13:34.141
Of course he's gonna mind.
Look at this rat box.

13:34.246 --> 13:35.941
It ain't got no doorstop.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.141
Someone opens the door too hard...

13:39.518 --> 13:40.610
hole in the wall.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.949
Dad, stop. It's not finished yet.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.319
I don't see no chair rail.
You know what that means.

13:45.424 --> 13:47.790
Man stands up from his chair too fast....

13:48.727 --> 13:51.890
Oh, come on, Hank.
Tell your father what you told your boss...

13:51.997 --> 13:54.465
and what you tell your stupid dog
every day.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.627
Give that miserable old man
the gift of love for Christmas.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.569
This hanging lamp don't look like
it can hold a man's weight.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.467
Grandpa, be careful!

14:02.575 --> 14:03.735
[Glass shattering]

14:03.843 --> 14:05.834
Come on, please, Dad. Stop!

14:05.945 --> 14:08.914
If you want him to stop,
just tell him how you feel.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.278
That window looks awful flimsy.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.082
-Dad, l--
-You can do it, Hank.

14:15.487 --> 14:16.511
Dad...

14:16.989 --> 14:18.286
I hate you.

14:18.390 --> 14:19.357
[Gasping]

14:22.828 --> 14:24.056
Is okay?

14:25.497 --> 14:27.021
You hate me, do you?

14:27.132 --> 14:31.000
After all the love
I allowed your mother to give you.

14:31.103 --> 14:34.334
Well, Merry Christmas and stay out.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.135
Tell Santy Claus to hurry.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.403
This place ain't gonna have a chimney
for long.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.371
[Cotton yelling]

14:44.950 --> 14:46.281
[Glass shattering]

14:46.819 --> 14:48.980
Hank, you don't really hate your father.

14:49.088 --> 14:52.489
These are just bigger emotions
than you're used to expressing.

14:52.591 --> 14:53.922
You got confused.

14:54.026 --> 14:56.790
Why don't you go inside and apologize?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.488
I also left my purse in there.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.532
I am not apologizing. I meant what I said.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.727
You can't really hate your dad.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.098
He's your dad.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.831
Yeah, well, there's nothing anywhere...

15:06.939 --> 15:09.430
that says a father and son
have to like each other...

15:09.541 --> 15:11.406
Iet alone love each other.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.623
[Grunting]

15:26.025 --> 15:27.959
CARTER: You can just leave
the won tons out there.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.550
[Carter speaking Chinese]

15:31.263 --> 15:33.857
Oh, you're not from the Noodle House.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.991
No, but I wish I was.

15:36.135 --> 15:39.662
-Chinese people don't have Christmas.
-What's wrong, little boy?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.172
My dad and my grandpa are fighting.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.505
Even if I get the Beiiy Hilltapes
I asked for...

15:45.611 --> 15:48.205
it'd still be the worst Christmas ever.

15:48.314 --> 15:51.147
Land sakes!
A family fighting at Christmas?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.911
That's not right.
Why don't I try talking to them?

15:54.019 --> 15:55.213
No offense, sir...

15:55.321 --> 15:59.155
but you couldn't even talk your way out
of working on Christmas Eve.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.748
I may just be a carpenter...

16:00.859 --> 16:03.089
but I'm often called upon
to resolve disputes.

16:03.195 --> 16:04.560
""He took my drill""...

16:04.663 --> 16:06.096
""That guy swiped my chalk""...

16:06.198 --> 16:07.165
and so on.

16:07.266 --> 16:10.394
Well, you do have a very soothing accent.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.060
We'll take my car.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.402
Wow! You must be some carpenter.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.941
[Cotton yelling]

16:20.179 --> 16:21.305
Bobby?

16:21.413 --> 16:24.644
I think we might be able
to get Dad his present after all...

16:24.750 --> 16:27.446
thanks to this nice old guy.

16:30.856 --> 16:34.292
I'm gonna get back in the limo.
I got Joseph on hold.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.158
Oh, my God! Jimmy Carter.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.830
I am Bobby's mother, Peggy Hill.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.363
I teach a short unit on your presidency.

16:44.036 --> 16:46.596
Teaching is
one of our most noble professions.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.366
Well, thank you for your honesty.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.832
They could not take that away from you.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.378
You must be Hank.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.309
You ran our country...

16:56.682 --> 16:57.910
America.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.378
Hank, I understand you told your father
you hate him.

17:01.487 --> 17:05.252
Hate's a strong word, Mr. President.
That's why I used it.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.082
Yep, hate my dad.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.989
You may say you hate your daddy...

17:09.094 --> 17:11.425
but I seem to recall
the Egyptians once said...

17:11.530 --> 17:14.089
they would never accept
lsrael's right to exist.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.464
Now, I think we all know
how that turned out.

17:18.103 --> 17:21.038
Now, why don't we go inside
and talk things over?

17:21.140 --> 17:23.938
I'm not going in there. I hate the man.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.712
Feels good every time I say it.

17:30.015 --> 17:31.243
Mr. Hill?

17:31.750 --> 17:34.048
-Jimmy Carter?
-Yes, this is Jimmy.

17:34.186 --> 17:36.051
Now, how about I come inside...

17:36.155 --> 17:38.089
and visit with you
about what your son said?

17:38.190 --> 17:40.658
I'd love to meet a war hero face to face.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.600
Assume the position, Mr. President!

17:50.702 --> 17:53.068
[Stuttering] There's no need for that.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.902
I've been nominated
for a Nobel Peace Prize.

17:58.377 --> 18:01.869
Look, the Secret Service didn't want me
to come in here at all.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.811
This was a compromise.

18:04.049 --> 18:06.984
I'd have done the same
if I was in your shoes.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.277
Same idea, bigger gun.

18:09.621 --> 18:11.953
Good. Something we can agree on.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.683
Let's build on that.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.817
Why do you think
your son said he hates you?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.361
He's a hateful crybaby.

18:17.463 --> 18:20.489
He was crying the second
he popped his head out of his mama.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.465
Like I told your father,
in these highly-charged situations...

18:24.570 --> 18:27.767
I find it's helpful to say something positive
about the other side.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.671
Sadat, for example,
thought Begin had excellent posture.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.438
Yeah? What'd my dad say about me?

18:34.480 --> 18:36.345
Why don't you go first?

18:39.184 --> 18:40.344
Come on.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.751
Deep down, just between you and me.
I won't tell anyone.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.915
-You don't really hate your son.
-Yes, I do.

18:46.024 --> 18:47.286
-But you don't--
-Head to toe.

18:47.392 --> 18:48.689
-No, really--
-And his wife.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.921
Look, he was a baby once.

18:51.029 --> 18:53.088
Everyone hated that baby.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.665
Hated a baby?

18:55.534 --> 18:57.331
Okay, how about this?

18:57.603 --> 18:59.901
Say there was a magic button
you could push...

19:00.005 --> 19:02.337
that would make Hank disappear forever.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.001
Everything else in the world
would stay the same...

19:05.110 --> 19:07.840
but Hank, your son,
would never have existed.

19:07.946 --> 19:10.710
Now, I'm serious here, mister.
Would you push that button?

19:10.816 --> 19:14.252
I ain't gots to answer
no hypothetical situation.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.911
Would you push that button?

19:16.021 --> 19:17.113
[Growling]

19:19.758 --> 19:20.986
Not yes.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.693
My father said he wouldn't obliterate me?

19:24.830 --> 19:26.127
His words?

19:26.265 --> 19:28.665
Now do you recognize his right to exist?

19:33.472 --> 19:34.769
Wonderful.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.598
You both seem to prefer a universe...

19:37.709 --> 19:40.701
in which the other party
hasn't magically disappeared.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.939
I think we have a framework for peace.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.982
Now, how do you feel
about going outside?

19:49.221 --> 19:51.451
I still got some nails left.

19:51.723 --> 19:54.624
If you come outside,
I'll let you shoot at my bulletproof limo.

20:08.974 --> 20:13.172
Hank, Cotton, I see a new era of trust
and understanding between you.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.777
Not so fast, Chompers. We had a deal.

20:18.116 --> 20:21.051
I gets to shoot me
a bulletproof motorcade.

20:21.186 --> 20:24.849
I think you got more important things
to do right now than shoot up my car.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.517
-No, I don't.
-Look, you're not shooting up my car.

20:27.626 --> 20:31.824
Hold on. Now, Dad, did he really tell you,
you could shoot up his car?

20:31.964 --> 20:33.454
With my nail gun.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.964
Is this true, sir?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.558
Well, I think
I may have put it on the table...

20:37.669 --> 20:39.330
but it seems to me the important thing is--

20:39.438 --> 20:41.030
I'm sorry. You gave your word.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.213
COTTON: Oops.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.438
They told me it was bulletproof.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.380
Let's get the heck out of here!

20:52.851 --> 20:54.978
That nail gun's pretty accurate for....

20:55.087 --> 20:57.817
What's it running at?
175 psi?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.653
-180.
-Sounds about right.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.057
Boy, I love shooting a nail gun.

21:03.228 --> 21:05.423
I love shooting a nail gun, too.

21:06.632 --> 21:08.190
That was amazing.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.928
Dad and Grandpa don't hate each other...

21:11.036 --> 21:13.937
the Lubeckis got
most of their house back...

21:14.072 --> 21:16.597
all because Jesus showed up.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.842
Bobby, what are you talking about?

21:18.977 --> 21:22.504
That guy. A carpenter, worked a miracle...

21:22.781 --> 21:25.978
his name was JC, rode in a limo....

21:26.084 --> 21:28.348
-Him?
-You thought that was....

21:31.790 --> 21:35.191
Well, he's nobody
but a one-terming peanut farmer.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.761
Man wore a sweater.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.961
Henpecked by the OPEC.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.761
And, Bobby,
that is how I saved Christmas.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.375
BUCK: No, I thaik you,
