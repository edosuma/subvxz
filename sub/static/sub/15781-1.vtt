WEBVTT

00:03.164 --> 00:04.406
Hey, Monarch!

00:05.015 --> 00:05.457
Huh?

00:05.482 --> 00:06.987
I'm taking
your fuckin' car!

00:13.180 --> 00:14.358
24!

00:15.215 --> 00:16.927
24!

00:19.629 --> 00:22.308
Nooooo!!

00:22.785 --> 00:24.168
Nooo!

00:24.193 --> 00:25.285
Agent Samson!

00:25.310 --> 00:27.750
Agent Samson,
can you hear me?

00:27.775 --> 00:30.199
Medic! I need a medic
over here!

00:30.224 --> 00:31.354
Heartrate's dropping.

00:31.379 --> 00:32.658
We gotta get that...

00:32.683 --> 00:34.233
schrapnel out
of him now!

00:34.258 --> 00:35.534
It's huge.

00:35.559 --> 00:37.117
I need more suction here...

00:37.518 --> 00:38.784
He's flatlining.

00:38.859 --> 00:40.992
Stay with us, Samson!

00:43.482 --> 00:47.250
Oh, you are a squirmy one,
Venture.

00:47.321 --> 00:50.117
Sit still.

00:50.142 --> 00:51.480
Hank... Hank?

00:51.505 --> 00:53.105
Do you have it? Over.

00:53.130 --> 00:54.731
Yeah, it's a clean shot.

00:54.756 --> 00:56.324
Good!
Hold it there.

00:56.349 --> 00:58.057
Dean?
Come in, Dean.

00:58.082 --> 00:59.871
Aahh! What?

00:59.896 --> 01:01.149
Did you stab him
to death yet?

01:01.174 --> 01:03.504
No, I didn't.
I lost my knife again.

01:03.529 --> 01:04.771
Because I hate it.

01:04.796 --> 01:06.373
I'm gonna take
my shot now.

01:06.398 --> 01:07.857
I have it figured out
that if I can just

01:07.882 --> 01:09.368
skim pop's belt buckle,

01:09.393 --> 01:11.250
maybe the bullet
will ricochet off it

01:11.275 --> 01:12.878
and kill the guy
with the gun.

01:13.011 --> 01:15.294
Hank, I will give you
so much money

01:15.319 --> 01:16.876
to not shoot your dad.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.978
I don't wanna do this,
Mr. Hatred.

01:19.003 --> 01:20.852
I'm not giving you
a choice here!

01:20.877 --> 01:22.670
You gotta stab Hitler!

01:22.695 --> 01:23.991
I can't!

01:24.016 --> 01:25.908
All right,
ya forced my hand.

01:25.933 --> 01:28.226
HELPeR, come in HELPeR.

01:28.251 --> 01:31.656
HELPeR,
murder Hitler.

01:33.975 --> 01:34.840
Down boy!

01:34.865 --> 01:37.004
Down! Down!
Heel!

01:37.029 --> 01:39.295
Giant boy detective, no!

01:39.320 --> 01:40.891
Come back!

01:40.916 --> 01:42.928
Dean!
Don't look at it!

01:42.953 --> 01:44.361
Shut your eyes, Dean!

01:44.386 --> 01:47.779
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens!

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.442 --> 02:08.252
It's beautiful!

02:11.893 --> 02:12.640
Ahh!

02:12.679 --> 02:14.414
You're getting face
all over me!

02:14.445 --> 02:15.916
Hot melting face!

02:18.010 --> 02:19.157
I did it...

02:19.182 --> 02:22.112
Yep, I hit every light
with one bullet.

02:22.137 --> 02:23.115
Ow!

03:03.497 --> 03:06.091
Hello? Anyone?

03:09.905 --> 03:11.581
Well, what the hell
do we do with the big lug

03:11.606 --> 03:13.039
when he wakes up?

03:13.064 --> 03:14.751
We put him back to work.

03:14.776 --> 03:16.971
- The guy's a damn traitor.
- He quit the agency!

03:17.044 --> 03:18.888
Top brass thinks there's
still some use for him

03:18.913 --> 03:20.534
if he can be
persuaded to curtail

03:20.559 --> 03:23.106
certain anti-social behaviors.

03:23.131 --> 03:25.870
What're they thinkin'?
The old brain drain?

03:25.895 --> 03:26.807
Full memory wipe?

03:26.832 --> 03:28.312
No. That brain of his
has got

03:28.337 --> 03:30.302
20 years worth of news
we can use.

03:30.327 --> 03:33.569
He just needs a little
attitude adjustment.

03:33.594 --> 03:35.825
Wakey wakey,
Mr. Hatred.

03:36.064 --> 03:37.744
It's time to make
all those little naked boys

03:37.769 --> 03:39.558
in your head go
bye bye...

03:40.550 --> 03:41.876
Stop him!!!

03:50.952 --> 03:54.051
Bring him back to room
2-2-7 and strap him down.

03:54.076 --> 03:56.274
Oh, Samson.
What're you doing out of bed--

03:56.299 --> 03:57.172
Oh, hey!

03:57.197 --> 03:58.827
What'd you bastards
do to me?

03:58.852 --> 04:00.890
You were dying!
We saved your life!

04:00.915 --> 04:03.311
Why, so I could be one
of your zombies?

04:03.336 --> 04:05.913
I know the kind of shit
you do on this level.

04:05.938 --> 04:07.922
Sick bay was
full of wounded!

04:07.947 --> 04:09.851
We had nowhere else
to bring you!

04:11.069 --> 04:13.212
What the hell
did you do to me?

04:15.207 --> 04:17.735
Just relax, Samson.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.978
Let us take care of you.

04:19.003 --> 04:20.175
Oh, god!

04:20.487 --> 04:21.906
Please...don't kill me!

04:21.930 --> 04:23.037
I'm not.

04:25.591 --> 04:26.887
No!
No, HELPeR!

04:26.912 --> 04:30.491
Whatever you do, do not engage
your helicopter blades!

04:30.516 --> 04:31.950
You'll kill us both!

04:32.441 --> 04:35.328
No, I won't.
Just trust me.

04:38.525 --> 04:39.910
Aaaahhh!

04:42.192 --> 04:43.975
Hank, you take out
the lights.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.301
I'll get the Nazis.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.981
I mean, if Oswald
can squeeze off

04:47.006 --> 04:49.100
three hot slugs
in six seconds,

04:49.125 --> 04:51.969
old Hatred can drop evil Nazis
in half that time.

04:51.994 --> 04:55.006
Is it me, or does every Nazi
wanna clone Hitler?

04:55.031 --> 04:56.803
It's like the only thing
they think of.

04:56.828 --> 04:58.007
Seems that way, right?

04:58.032 --> 04:59.483
I guess when
everybody hates you,

04:59.508 --> 05:01.512
ya fixate on making
rotten Hitlers.

05:01.537 --> 05:03.638
How can you say that
about Hitler?!

05:03.663 --> 05:06.131
I love Hitler!
And Hitler loves me!

05:06.156 --> 05:07.410
He's not all bad.

05:07.435 --> 05:09.554
Hitler just needs someone
to believe in him!

05:09.579 --> 05:10.827
Can't you just
give Hitler a chance?

05:10.852 --> 05:13.050
Dean!
Hitler is a mass murderer!

05:13.075 --> 05:15.274
He's pure evil!
And you have to kill him!

05:15.299 --> 05:17.780
I won't destroy the only thing
I've ever loved!

05:17.805 --> 05:20.500
I won't kill Hitler!
Never ever!

05:23.225 --> 05:25.091
You might want to look
at your face.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.548
Oh, come on!

05:26.573 --> 05:29.216
I shoulda asked RuPaul
to paint my camo face!

05:29.241 --> 05:30.470
I'll kill Hitler!

05:30.495 --> 05:32.428
I've killed hundreds
of Nazis before.

05:32.453 --> 05:34.541
Many of them
with a grenade launcher.

05:35.010 --> 05:36.691
Medal of Honor, Heroes II.

05:36.716 --> 05:38.190
I can also blow up
a submarine.

05:38.215 --> 05:40.907
He must be killed
with this golden dagger.

05:40.932 --> 05:43.326
And only after
the cleansing of fire.

05:43.707 --> 05:45.484
And Dean is the only one

05:45.509 --> 05:47.210
he'll let get close enough
to do it.

05:47.235 --> 05:50.195
All right, everybody out.

05:50.220 --> 05:51.420
I gotta wipe.

05:51.445 --> 05:54.181
Good lord, have you been using
the toilet under there

05:54.206 --> 05:55.076
this whole time?

05:55.101 --> 05:57.074
We are at war
with Hitler again!

05:57.099 --> 05:59.648
This is how it's done on
the front lines, soldier!

05:59.673 --> 06:01.458
Hank, hand me that magazine!

06:01.786 --> 06:02.851
We're out of TP.

06:03.171 --> 06:04.762
Hey, um...Mister?

06:04.787 --> 06:06.738
News flash from
the situation room.

06:06.763 --> 06:08.113
We're outta toilet paper...

06:08.138 --> 06:10.765
You told me you hadda make
number one, not number two, kid.

06:10.790 --> 06:14.384
Well, I don't speak your
special spy code talk!

06:14.409 --> 06:15.608
Come on, dude.

06:15.633 --> 06:17.657
Don't make me do
the crab walk here.

06:17.682 --> 06:18.897
Fine, kid.

06:18.922 --> 06:20.779
Where do you keep the shit
tickets in this dump?

06:20.804 --> 06:23.504
The linen closet!
Right down the hall.

06:23.926 --> 06:24.663
Hurry!

06:24.688 --> 06:27.437
Jeez, deliver me from 1978.

06:27.462 --> 06:28.498
Did you find it?

06:28.523 --> 06:31.843
No, but I think I found
your dad's time machine.

06:46.944 --> 06:47.875
Dammit, HELPeR,

06:47.900 --> 06:49.611
if I wasn't afraid
it might stop my heart,

06:49.636 --> 06:51.294
I would shut you down.

06:51.319 --> 06:55.416
"'Don't take another step,' said
Giant Boy Detective, urgently.

06:55.441 --> 06:57.187
'The floor is booby-trapped!'

06:57.212 --> 06:58.800
'How do you know?'
asked Suzy--"

06:58.825 --> 06:59.920
All right, Wishbone.

06:59.945 --> 07:02.040
Why don't you give
Giant Boy Detective a rest?

07:02.065 --> 07:03.318
You're givin' me
a migraine here.

07:03.343 --> 07:05.210
I only have five more
chapters to go.

07:05.235 --> 07:08.418
It'd be a whole lot more fun
if you read Suzy's parts.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.219
"'Gosh,' said Suzy,

07:10.244 --> 07:12.701
'How did you know it was
the rancher all along?'

07:12.726 --> 07:15.337
'Simple, Suzy,'
thundered Giant Boy Detective,

07:15.362 --> 07:16.675
his freakishly loud voice

07:16.700 --> 07:18.616
echoing off the walls
of the old mine.

07:18.641 --> 07:20.401
'Cow patties don't sparkle.

07:20.426 --> 07:22.379
That was gold dust
on his boots!'

07:22.404 --> 07:24.027
The end."
Happy now?

07:24.052 --> 07:26.407
Wow.
I did not see that coming.

07:27.922 --> 07:28.795
Brock!

07:28.820 --> 07:30.470
I know you couldn't
quit us!

07:30.495 --> 07:32.318
Shh. They can't know
that I'm here.

07:32.656 --> 07:35.001
HELPeR!
I knew you couldn't quit us!

07:35.026 --> 07:37.120
You gotta be quiet.
I don't have much time.

07:37.145 --> 07:38.100
Now where is everybody?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.465
Hank's in the bathroom
with Mr. Doe or something.

07:40.490 --> 07:42.527
Pop's getting yelled at by
a bunch of your old friends...

07:42.552 --> 07:45.727
Samson! What the dog-dammit
are you doing back?

07:46.393 --> 07:48.194
Brock,
are you 'on the lam'?

07:48.219 --> 07:49.655
No time to explain.
Here.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.728
Give this to your dad for me.
I gotta go.

07:51.753 --> 07:54.196
Wait. Are you taking
HELPeR with you?

07:54.221 --> 07:55.253
Yyyyyeah, Dean.

07:55.278 --> 07:57.888
I'm afraid I gotta borrow him
for a while.

07:57.913 --> 08:00.241
Then here.
Take my hoverbike.

08:00.266 --> 08:01.509
You keep it, Dean.

08:01.534 --> 08:03.491
And tell your brother...
I don't know.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.843
Tell him to "stay gold"
or you write something.

08:06.868 --> 08:08.464
You're good with words.

08:09.248 --> 08:11.498
Had a total cray-pas situation
up there.

08:11.523 --> 08:13.381
Took me a while
to lock it down.

08:13.406 --> 08:15.390
Whoa?
What happened to these guys?

08:15.415 --> 08:16.938
What did you bore them
to death?

08:16.963 --> 08:17.941
Brock.

08:18.293 --> 08:19.714
H-He was just here.

08:19.739 --> 08:20.567
You missed him.

08:20.592 --> 08:21.755
Oooh, yeah.

08:21.780 --> 08:23.995
And what, he whisked away
up the chimney

08:24.020 --> 08:25.906
with a thumb of his nose?

08:25.931 --> 08:26.547
Ooh! Wait!

08:26.572 --> 08:29.059
I think I hear hoofsteps up
on the roof!

08:35.030 --> 08:37.414
That's the X-1!
Maybe Brock's back!

08:37.438 --> 08:40.099
You hear that, Giant Boy Detective?
Brock's home!

08:40.124 --> 08:42.284
His name isn't
Giant Boy Detective.

08:42.309 --> 08:43.567
And Dad said he has to go.

08:43.592 --> 08:45.553
Giant Boy Detective
isn't going anywhere.

08:45.578 --> 08:48.475
Aw, H. E. Double hockey sticks!

08:48.500 --> 08:50.163
It's the X-1 alright.

08:50.188 --> 08:52.042
But that sure ain't Brock.

08:53.052 --> 08:55.268
What the hell
did you do to my jet!?

08:55.293 --> 08:57.580
You, sir, are lucky
I returned it.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.907
No, you're lucky it has
a homing autopilot function!

08:59.932 --> 09:01.930
What is going on?
Who are these idiots?

09:01.955 --> 09:05.092
This is my LARP crew,
The Orchard Street Wolf Pack.

09:05.117 --> 09:06.682
They are here
to keep the peace.

09:06.707 --> 09:07.974
Now step aside!

09:07.999 --> 09:10.064
I have business
to attend to!

09:10.447 --> 09:12.486
Finally!
Look what they did to my jet.

09:13.165 --> 09:14.894
I think the Monarch's boys
did that.

09:14.919 --> 09:16.277
Whatever!
Just... I don't know.

09:16.302 --> 09:17.770
Kill these guys
or something.

09:18.218 --> 09:20.411
What you got there?
Foam swords?

09:20.436 --> 09:21.531
We made them ourselves.

09:21.556 --> 09:22.859
Mine's a battle axe.

09:22.884 --> 09:24.206
Look, I'm sorry!

09:24.231 --> 09:26.501
But I'm in deep doo-doo with
this whole cloning thing.

09:26.526 --> 09:28.155
The OSI's on my ass,

09:28.187 --> 09:29.348
and now I have
these other nut-bags

09:29.373 --> 09:31.575
making me clone their dead hero
"or else."

09:31.600 --> 09:32.473
I don't care.

09:32.498 --> 09:35.795
I gave you a priceless family
heirloom and you deceived me.

09:35.820 --> 09:37.301
Now good day!

09:37.326 --> 09:40.586
I've come to seek council with
the necromancer in your village.

09:40.611 --> 09:42.336
But you're a necromancer!

09:42.361 --> 09:44.325
That's what necromancers do!

09:44.350 --> 09:46.859
That is the definition
of necromancer!

09:46.884 --> 09:48.355
Well, yes, technically.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.213
But the term is used
loosely these days.

09:50.238 --> 09:51.955
Magician, wizard, warlock...

09:51.980 --> 09:53.200
they sound rather goofy.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.790
Necromancer is all
we've got left.

09:55.815 --> 09:56.632
Omelet?

09:56.657 --> 09:58.487
You can't do anything?

09:58.512 --> 10:00.579
I'm sorry, I can't hel-

10:00.604 --> 10:02.604
what is that racket?!

10:02.629 --> 10:04.352
Drop it!
Drop it, boy!

10:04.377 --> 10:06.201
Drop!
Drop it!

10:06.226 --> 10:08.206
He's been in
my reliquary chest!

10:08.231 --> 10:09.004
I'm sorry!

10:09.029 --> 10:10.510
My dad wanted to kill him!

10:10.535 --> 10:11.735
I was gonna hide him here!

10:11.760 --> 10:15.319
He has the holy arm of
Saint Moses the Black of Scete!

10:15.344 --> 10:17.148
Where did he even find it?

10:18.347 --> 10:21.008
This dog has
a great evil in him!

10:21.033 --> 10:22.270
That is learned behavior.

10:22.295 --> 10:23.955
That's the owner's fault
usually.

10:23.980 --> 10:25.834
You have to show them
that you're the alpha male!

10:25.859 --> 10:27.953
Not even the great
Cesar Milan

10:27.978 --> 10:29.932
could whisper
this hell hound!

10:29.957 --> 10:32.629
Dean, give me
your funny pages!

10:36.321 --> 10:37.620
Bad news, Dean.

10:37.780 --> 10:40.044
Your dog is
the spawn of hell,

10:40.069 --> 10:41.224
and you must kill him.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.681
Why does everybody want
to kill my dog!?

10:43.706 --> 10:47.512
Because he carries
the soul of evil!

10:47.575 --> 10:51.329
I must prepare
the ritual of cleansing!

10:51.354 --> 10:53.455
I totally wish that guy
lived next to me.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.739
Seriously cool.

10:54.764 --> 10:56.135
And his daughter
is pretty.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.503
Bonus...

10:57.528 --> 11:00.354
Hey, aaah, what comic book
were you reading?

11:00.895 --> 11:02.442
I've done all that I can,

11:03.936 --> 11:06.204
but he's highly unstable
in this state.

11:06.229 --> 11:08.400
We thank you, Herr Doctor.

11:08.425 --> 11:11.301
You will be
rewarded handsomely

11:11.326 --> 11:12.217
in the fourth Reich.

11:12.242 --> 11:13.004
Yeah, whatever.

11:13.029 --> 11:15.232
But if you fellas don't find
another body soon,

11:15.257 --> 11:17.428
you're gonna be all
out of Reichs.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.254
Workin' with Nazis now?

11:22.279 --> 11:24.277
That's pretty low,
even for you.

11:24.302 --> 11:26.655
Oh, hey.
You Hunter's friend, right?

11:26.680 --> 11:29.590
Not anymore.
I need an operation fast.

11:29.615 --> 11:31.843
And you're the best
I know at this kind of...

11:31.868 --> 11:33.252
unorthodox work.

11:33.286 --> 11:35.274
Lemme guess -- you want
to beat up Hunter

11:35.299 --> 11:36.523
but you can't punch a girl?

11:36.548 --> 11:38.598
So you want me to make
a snip, snip!

11:38.623 --> 11:40.338
Meow! Cat fight!

11:40.363 --> 11:41.228
What? No.

11:41.253 --> 11:45.012
I want you to remove something
a little higher up.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.154
What made you change
your mind?

11:47.179 --> 11:47.640
Huh?

11:47.665 --> 11:49.367
I put in a lot of those
this year.

11:49.392 --> 11:51.342
Ever since the Iron Man,

11:51.367 --> 11:53.368
everybody wants
the robot hearts.

11:53.393 --> 11:56.594
Yeah, well...theirs probably
don't talk this much.

11:56.619 --> 11:59.039
How come all of a sudden
you trust me now?

11:59.064 --> 12:01.043
What's to stop me
from killing you

12:01.068 --> 12:02.597
when you're under?

12:04.818 --> 12:05.705
Him...

12:08.548 --> 12:09.869
Hmm.

12:10.197 --> 12:10.877
Oh.

12:11.418 --> 12:12.605
Aha!

12:13.112 --> 12:14.463
Okay.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.560
And... time!

12:17.585 --> 12:18.507
Wha!

12:18.532 --> 12:19.093
Oh...

12:19.118 --> 12:22.587
the stopwatch doesn't have
an hour function, so...

12:22.612 --> 12:23.514
whatever.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.619
You somehow built your
blindfold into your gun.

12:27.644 --> 12:30.554
And I'm pretty sure
the trigger doesn't go there.

12:30.579 --> 12:32.887
Hank,
where is your uniform?

12:32.912 --> 12:34.530
I'm not wearing
that clown suit.

12:34.555 --> 12:35.637
And you are
not the boss of me.

12:35.662 --> 12:36.836
Au contraire!

12:36.861 --> 12:40.144
I'm Tony Danza to your
spunky Alyssa Milano!

12:40.169 --> 12:42.636
I am full on Charles in charge
of you!

12:42.661 --> 12:44.554
You are my unit!

12:44.579 --> 12:45.054
Unit.

12:45.079 --> 12:47.585
And a unit operates as one!

12:47.610 --> 12:50.229
We dress the same,
we walk the same,

12:50.254 --> 12:51.876
we eat the same!

12:51.901 --> 12:54.095
Do you like pineapples and ham
on your pizza?

12:54.120 --> 12:55.130
Gross, no.

12:55.155 --> 12:56.254
Well you do now!

12:56.279 --> 12:58.248
Why? Because I do!

12:58.273 --> 12:59.251
Unit!

12:59.276 --> 13:01.564
Now put on your Venture blues
before I tell you

13:01.589 --> 13:03.733
how much you love country
and western music!

13:03.758 --> 13:05.225
Brock is my bodyguard.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.351
Not you.

13:08.023 --> 13:08.872
Take this.

13:08.897 --> 13:10.863
Cool! Okay.

13:13.049 --> 13:14.236
Now shoot me.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.422
Huh?
Really?

13:15.447 --> 13:17.312
Henry, I trust you.

13:17.337 --> 13:20.330
And if you don't trust me,
I want you to shoot me.

13:20.355 --> 13:22.016
Hank.
I don't like Henry.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.303
Well I love Henry!

13:23.328 --> 13:24.652
Now shoot me!

13:26.073 --> 13:28.007
Those bullets are like
a dollar each!

13:28.032 --> 13:31.054
I'm taking every missed shot out
of your allowance!

13:31.092 --> 13:33.340
Will you two stop it!

13:34.840 --> 13:37.923
When the going gets tough,
that boy always gets going.

13:37.948 --> 13:39.939
You really want me
to shoot you?

13:39.964 --> 13:43.330
I have tried everything
to earn your respect.

13:43.355 --> 13:45.364
If this is what it's gonna take
to get it,

13:45.389 --> 13:47.059
I'll take the bullet!

13:47.084 --> 13:48.401
Shoot me, Henry!

13:50.601 --> 13:52.802
That's two dollars out
of your allowance,

13:52.827 --> 13:54.650
and I'm still not bleeding!

13:58.881 --> 14:00.713
Hot damn potato!

14:00.738 --> 14:01.905
Ya hit me!

14:01.930 --> 14:04.376
Oh my God!
I am so sorry.

14:04.401 --> 14:06.298
Don't apologize, boy!

14:06.323 --> 14:08.008
Remember this moment!

14:08.033 --> 14:10.626
Remember when we became
blood brothers!

14:10.651 --> 14:13.331
Remember when ol' Hatred
took a bullet for you!

14:13.356 --> 14:17.063
Remember the power,
the regret, the confusion!

14:17.444 --> 14:18.804
Get it away from me!

14:19.213 --> 14:21.484
Come on, Dean!
HELPeR's back!

14:21.509 --> 14:24.030
It's just like
when Brock was here!

14:24.316 --> 14:27.080
He just wants a hug, Dean!

14:28.583 --> 14:30.273
It's time, Steve.

14:30.298 --> 14:31.516
I have to do this.

14:33.362 --> 14:35.158
Violence begets violence.

14:35.183 --> 14:36.984
You don't have to live
like that anymore.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.755
They played me
for a fool.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.307
Double-crossed me.
All of them.

14:40.332 --> 14:42.168
If I don't do this,
I'll never be free.

14:42.193 --> 14:43.675
Maybe you should
wait a while.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.093
I mean, you're not exactly
in peak physical condition.

14:46.118 --> 14:49.222
I'm just gonna keep getting
softer if I stay any longer.

14:49.247 --> 14:51.650
I tried to get you to run
with me in the mornings...

14:51.675 --> 14:53.527
You got bionic legs, man.

14:53.552 --> 14:55.567
It's no fun trying to keep up.

14:55.964 --> 14:56.894
Aww.

14:57.066 --> 14:59.062
Hey, what's this?
For me?

14:59.508 --> 15:02.087
Well, we couldn't let you go off
on a commando raid

15:02.112 --> 15:03.432
half-dressed, now, could we?

15:03.457 --> 15:05.632
I got you guys something, too.

15:05.657 --> 15:09.580
I'm afraid art therapy
isn't really my bag, but...

15:09.605 --> 15:11.853
it's the least I could do
to thank you for all your help.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.087
It's beautiful.

15:13.112 --> 15:14.307
We'll cherish it always.

15:14.332 --> 15:16.280
I'll send you a postcard
if I make it.

15:16.305 --> 15:19.542
And you! Stay away
from those campers, huh?

15:19.567 --> 15:21.824
I don't wanna see you
on youtube again.

15:22.027 --> 15:24.690
Why does everybody
suddenly want clones?

15:24.715 --> 15:26.717
What are you guys gonna
pay me with, a dog?

15:26.742 --> 15:28.078
I'm not taking
any more barters!

15:28.103 --> 15:28.868
I need cash.

15:28.893 --> 15:30.546
You will be paid
handsomely.

15:30.571 --> 15:33.801
You and your family
will live like kings

15:33.826 --> 15:37.072
in the glory of
the new fatherland!

15:37.517 --> 15:38.955
Wait!

15:38.980 --> 15:40.312
You guys are Nazis!

15:40.337 --> 15:42.011
- Nein, we are not.
- Yes, you are!

15:42.036 --> 15:44.617
And that's like the worst fake
German accent I've ever heard.

15:44.642 --> 15:46.175
Vis is undt outrage!

15:46.200 --> 15:48.031
Yours is worse!
Wait!

15:48.056 --> 15:49.696
I get this...
really?

15:49.721 --> 15:51.153
You went with
that cliche?

15:51.178 --> 15:52.776
C'mon, really?

15:52.801 --> 15:56.569
This dog is
the Blood Grail!

15:56.594 --> 15:59.127
In his veins
flows the blood

15:59.152 --> 16:00.312
of our leader.

16:00.337 --> 16:01.544
Yeah, Hitler.

16:02.146 --> 16:04.745
I'm not cloning Hitler!
Get out of here.

16:04.770 --> 16:06.064
This is not a request.

16:06.089 --> 16:08.038
You have eight months
to take that dog

16:08.063 --> 16:11.690
and make a beautiful
pink sweet baby Hitler.

16:12.103 --> 16:14.025
If upon our return,

16:14.050 --> 16:16.360
this is not
accomplished,

16:16.385 --> 16:19.022
the consequences
will be grave,

16:19.047 --> 16:21.480
Herr Dr. Venture.

16:21.949 --> 16:23.394
A doggie!

16:24.039 --> 16:25.473
And he likes me.

16:25.832 --> 16:27.594
Hank, we can't wait
for Brock anymore.

16:27.619 --> 16:28.681
We need a bodyguard.

16:28.706 --> 16:29.970
Aw, c'mon!

16:29.995 --> 16:31.776
The doggie made a poo poo!

16:31.801 --> 16:34.131
Great!
Some fucking master race...

16:34.156 --> 16:35.899
Dean, don't get attached
to that rotten dog,

16:35.924 --> 16:36.854
he's not staying.

16:36.879 --> 16:38.895
Burgos, Carl.

16:40.515 --> 16:42.124
Serbian diplomat.

16:42.149 --> 16:44.433
He's giving a speech
at the U.N. on Thursday

16:44.458 --> 16:46.439
and the JSO want him dead.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.007
But not in their
back yard.

16:48.032 --> 16:49.685
Hmph.
What's the offer?

16:49.710 --> 16:51.269
One hundred fifty.

16:51.294 --> 16:54.099
Tell 'em two hundred
and give it to Zara. Next.

16:54.124 --> 16:55.715
Gustavson, Paul.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.528
Norwegian industrialist.

16:57.553 --> 17:00.026
Greenpeace says the pollution
from his factory...

17:00.051 --> 17:00.700
What the-- hey!

17:00.725 --> 17:02.348
What? Hey!
Who are you?

17:02.373 --> 17:03.328
Are you with the
Blackhearts?

17:03.353 --> 17:04.979
None of your business.
Get out of here.

17:05.003 --> 17:05.976
You get out of here.

17:06.001 --> 17:07.182
I was here first.

17:07.207 --> 17:08.470
Why don't you make me?

17:08.494 --> 17:10.053
Last order of business.

17:10.078 --> 17:14.097
I think we may have a mole
within the organization.

17:14.122 --> 17:16.113
Really?
What gives you...

17:16.137 --> 17:17.164
that impression?

17:17.189 --> 17:18.496
Idiots!

17:21.740 --> 17:22.855
Whoa whoa whoa.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.429
Easy, there, Babe Ruthless.

17:24.454 --> 17:26.165
That's close enough.

17:26.190 --> 17:28.373
Samson!?
Jeez, is that you?

17:28.397 --> 17:30.320
You have really
let yourself go.

17:30.345 --> 17:32.972
What're you gonna do,
little man -- woman.

17:32.997 --> 17:35.249
I know you know how
to stab me in the back,

17:35.274 --> 17:38.768
but do you really have
the balls to shoot me?

17:39.146 --> 17:40.176
Nope.

17:40.349 --> 17:41.850
But she does.

17:52.709 --> 17:54.058
All right,
let's say I do it.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.779
You do understand that
he'll be a little baby

17:55.804 --> 17:57.145
and have none of
your friend's memories.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.717
Really?
That's a gyp.

17:58.742 --> 18:00.089
I thought maybe
he'd look like Hank.

18:00.286 --> 18:02.378
Fat chance,
I lost all my slugs

18:02.403 --> 18:03.857
with your friend out there.

18:04.256 --> 18:06.236
Fine! Do it!

18:06.261 --> 18:08.243
I will raise him
as my own son!

18:08.268 --> 18:09.190
Anything!

18:09.215 --> 18:11.046
Just bring 24 back to me,
please!

18:11.071 --> 18:13.887
Okay, okay!
Let's see the half mill.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.580
This relic belonged
to my father's father.

18:16.605 --> 18:18.606
It has been passed down
to the first born male

18:18.631 --> 18:19.740
in my family's line.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.338
What?
It's a comic.

18:21.363 --> 18:23.289
A comic that has a price on it
for ten cents.

18:23.314 --> 18:26.117
A comic?
That is Marvel number one!

18:26.142 --> 18:27.519
Look, I wasn't born
yesterday.

18:27.544 --> 18:29.923
There is no way that something
featuring Ka-zar the Great,

18:29.948 --> 18:33.240
and 12 pages of jungle adventure
is worth half a million bucks.

18:33.265 --> 18:34.952
That's in almost
dead mint condition!

18:34.977 --> 18:37.395
That is
CGC rated at 9.6!

18:37.420 --> 18:40.121
Okay, why don't you go
sell your magic beans

18:40.146 --> 18:41.621
to another superscientist

18:41.646 --> 18:43.322
with an illegal
cloning facility.

18:43.347 --> 18:44.766
I'm done with this crap.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.930
Hold on to this.
Look it up on the internet.

18:46.955 --> 18:49.290
You will see that what I tell
you is completely true.

18:49.315 --> 18:50.424
And take this.

18:50.449 --> 18:52.573
What's this -- the world's
most valuable cooler?

18:52.598 --> 18:54.631
It's cloning material.
It's 24's finger.

18:54.656 --> 18:57.387
It still has the Blackbeard's
diamond treasure ring I got him.

18:57.412 --> 18:58.781
You can keep that
too, I guess.

18:58.806 --> 19:01.735
It's worth two low, low payments
of 29.95.

19:01.760 --> 19:02.941
Alright, get out of here.

19:02.966 --> 19:05.016
I don't want to tell my kids
about this crap.

19:06.152 --> 19:07.908
Sorry about the bad news
Highlander.

19:07.933 --> 19:09.820
Looks like you'll never
see the Quickening.

19:09.845 --> 19:10.577
Huh?

19:10.988 --> 19:11.919
Hey, Pop!

19:11.944 --> 19:14.461
This came for you all the way
from Argentina.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.886
Hank, this is opened
already.

19:15.911 --> 19:17.720
I had to, it was beeping.

19:17.745 --> 19:19.543
So explosive device
never occurred to you?

19:19.568 --> 19:21.271
Hank, you gotta
be more careful now!

19:21.296 --> 19:22.489
Your safety net's gone.

19:22.514 --> 19:24.515
I know...
Brock's gone.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.024
Yeah, that too.

19:26.435 --> 19:27.112
What is this?

19:27.137 --> 19:29.227
It's HELPeR's head wrapped up
in Brock's coat.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.684
Good God, he's been left on.

19:30.711 --> 19:31.519
It's okay.

19:31.544 --> 19:34.307
Okay, I know, boy, it must have
been a nightmare.

19:34.332 --> 19:36.706
Hank, push the eyes for five
seconds while I hold this.

19:36.731 --> 19:38.614
Are we retrieving
his data files

19:38.639 --> 19:40.103
to find out where Brock is?

19:40.128 --> 19:42.225
He's in Argentina
near a Mailboxes, Etc.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.060
No, this is
a hard-reboot.

19:44.085 --> 19:46.240
I'm not about to send
a robot to therapy.

19:46.265 --> 19:47.666
Can I have Brock's jacket?

19:47.691 --> 19:49.184
If you're so excited
about worthless garbage,

19:49.209 --> 19:50.282
you want this too?

19:50.441 --> 19:52.212
Yeah, totally!

19:54.484 --> 19:56.371
What?
What's this crap?

19:56.396 --> 19:57.771
Where's Batman?!

19:57.796 --> 19:59.847
What is your relationship with

20:01.358 --> 20:03.402
the assassin
Molotov Cocktease?

20:03.427 --> 20:05.396
It's...complicated.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.430
How long have you known
about our operation?

20:07.455 --> 20:08.562
What operation?

20:08.587 --> 20:10.730
I didn't even know
you guys still existed.

20:10.755 --> 20:13.170
You expect us to believe
it's just coincidence

20:13.195 --> 20:15.399
that an O.S.I. Agent waltzed
into the middle

20:15.424 --> 20:17.223
of an ongoing S.P.H.I.N.X.
Operation?

20:17.248 --> 20:19.176
I don't care what you believe.

20:19.201 --> 20:21.820
I told you, I'm not
with the agency anymore.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.866
I quit.
Or they fired me.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.842
I don't even know
anymore, man.

20:26.123 --> 20:27.199
I see.

20:27.224 --> 20:29.582
Well, then perhaps we'll leave
the two of you

20:29.607 --> 20:32.198
to discuss what it is
we should do with you.

20:32.223 --> 20:33.480
"The two of you?"

20:33.505 --> 20:35.854
Helluva pickle you got us into,
eh, boy-o?

20:35.879 --> 20:37.897
Hunter!
They got you, too, huh?

20:37.922 --> 20:40.000
Well it serves you right,
you two-timing bitch.

20:40.025 --> 20:41.923
What the hell are you so P.O.'d
at me for?

20:41.948 --> 20:43.857
So I sicced those three
reprobates on you.

20:43.882 --> 20:46.013
So what?
You're Brock Samson, damn it!

20:46.038 --> 20:47.546
Thought I'd add a little
spice to your life.

20:47.571 --> 20:49.550
So, what, you did me
a favor?

20:49.575 --> 20:50.952
You're damn skippy,
I did!

20:50.977 --> 20:52.307
Got you out of that
dead end job

20:52.332 --> 20:53.623
and back to doing
what you're best at.

20:53.648 --> 20:54.580
And then what?

20:54.605 --> 20:57.034
You were hoping I'd be so
grateful to you and Molotov

20:57.059 --> 20:59.546
I'd join up with your little
thrill kill girls' club?

20:59.571 --> 21:02.339
Sorry, I don't have
the tits for it.

21:03.042 --> 21:04.600
'Coulda fooled me,
Poppin' Fresh.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.115
Unless...

21:06.140 --> 21:07.919
you were working undercover...

21:07.944 --> 21:09.061
That's it.

21:09.086 --> 21:11.036
Work it out, Thinkenstein.

21:11.061 --> 21:14.271
The sex change, the defection--
it was all a ruse

21:14.296 --> 21:16.251
so you could infiltrate
Molotov's group?

21:16.276 --> 21:17.665
Well, you're half-right
so far...

21:17.690 --> 21:19.606
You're still with O.S.I.,
aren't you?

21:19.631 --> 21:21.140
S.P.H.I.N.X. wasn't
after Molotov--

21:21.165 --> 21:22.560
They were after you!

21:22.585 --> 21:23.731
I knew it!

21:23.756 --> 21:25.521
Boy-o...

21:25.546 --> 21:28.500
you don't know dick.

22:01.545 --> 22:03.505
The cleansing of fire
is complete.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.908
Now Hitler must die...

22:05.933 --> 22:07.281
again.

22:07.306 --> 22:10.167
Bring me
giant boy detective!

22:10.573 --> 22:11.862
He ran away.

22:14.895 --> 22:16.842
Hark!
Who goes there?!

22:17.936 --> 22:19.978
It's okay,
Giant Boy Detective.

22:20.363 --> 22:21.870
Whose a good dog?

22:21.895 --> 22:23.679
I mean, Hitler.

22:23.704 --> 22:26.128
Who's a good...
Fuhrer?

22:26.845 --> 22:28.461
Alert!
Come in--

22:28.486 --> 22:30.509
Na, na, no, lone wolf.

22:30.534 --> 22:31.785
We don't want to tattle.

22:38.338 --> 22:40.313
I can cross
"stab Hitler to death"

22:40.338 --> 22:41.719
off my list of cool crap

22:41.744 --> 22:43.592
I thought
I'd never get to do.

22:43.617 --> 22:44.727
Brock?

22:44.752 --> 22:45.951
Hey Hank...

22:45.976 --> 22:47.208
'killed Hitler...

22:47.233 --> 22:50.213
W-Why are you here?
Why are you wearing that?

22:50.354 --> 22:51.693
Why didn't you
say good bye to me?

22:51.718 --> 22:53.310
- Why didn't--
- Hank! Listen buddy.

22:53.335 --> 22:54.536
You have to trust me.

22:54.561 --> 22:56.624
You can't tell anybody
we were here.

22:56.649 --> 22:58.153
This is our little secret.

22:58.178 --> 22:59.125
Why did you leave me?

22:59.150 --> 23:00.695
Hank, I'll never
leave you.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.654
But right now, these guys
need me a little more.

23:03.679 --> 23:05.722
You can share me Hank,
can't you?

23:06.019 --> 23:07.475
I mean look how
big you got.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.795
Can barely get my hands
around these shoulders.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.705
Hank! Hank!

23:11.730 --> 23:14.227
I'm over here!
It's okay! I'm with --

23:14.252 --> 23:17.204
Hank, did you kill Hitler?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.871
No, it was...
it was...

23:19.896 --> 23:20.720
an angel.

23:20.745 --> 23:22.435
Oh...
I thought it was you.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.640
I was gonna buy you
an ice cream cake and stuff.

23:24.665 --> 23:26.542
Naw, I was just kidding.

23:26.567 --> 23:27.975
Yeah, it was me.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.735
I totally killed Hitler.
