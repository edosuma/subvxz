10:37.477 --> 10:40.011

Yesterday, she and her son were
kidnapped by Leland David Bray.

What do we know about him?

10:45.485 --> 10:47.152
Bray is ex-CIA.

10:47.154 --> 10:50.288
In 2011, he went rogue while
on a black op in Athens.

10:50.290 --> 10:52.357
Since then, he's gone to the dark side.

10:52.359 --> 10:55.360
TOM: He has abducted and killed
over a dozen covert operatives.

10:55.362 --> 10:58.229
And Bray has made a fortune
targeting assets like Copeland,

10:58.231 --> 10:59.998
stripping them down, and
selling what they know

11:00.000 --> 11:02.767

or terrorist organizations.

I love you.

34:13.630 --> 34:15.230
Do you hear me?

34:15.232 --> 34:16.831
I love you so much.

34:18.167 --> 34:20.502
Anna? Hey, hey. Take it easy.

34:21.771 --> 34:23.237
Anna, hang up the phone.

34:23.239 --> 34:25.907
The signal interference could
trigger the explosive device.

34:25.909 --> 34:28.342
I just felt something... a click.

34:28.344 --> 34:29.911
Kill your phones, your radios.

34:29.913 --> 34:31.947
Any interference could
trigger the detonator.

34:34.317 --> 34:37.918
How do you plan to access the device?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.788
(SCREAMING)

34:39.790 --> 34:42.389
Hold on, hold on, hold on! I can feel it.
I can feel it.

34:42.391 --> 34:44.159
- You're doing good.
- Okay.

34:44.161 --> 34:45.360
- You're doing good.
- Anna, don't move.

34:45.362 --> 34:48.063
I can't promise this
next part won't hurt.

34:48.065 --> 34:49.331
(ANNA SCREAMS)

34:49.333 --> 34:51.266
Okay, it's out, it's
out, but it won't give.

34:51.268 --> 34:53.601
Hey, did Tom ever tell you about
the time he tried to kill me?

34:53.603 --> 34:55.070
- Not now.
- You know, funny story.

34:55.072 --> 34:57.060
He tried to kill me
at point-blank range.

34:57.076 --> 34:58.242
Dumont, talk to me.

34:58.244 --> 34:59.410
I'm looking at the images you sent.

34:59.412 --> 35:01.712
I think the white module
is the main switch,

35:01.714 --> 35:03.548
the back one's the time delay.

35:03.550 --> 35:04.715
How long ago was the click?

35:04.717 --> 35:06.350
Two minutes, maybe less.

35:06.352 --> 35:07.985
If I'm being honest, I
shot up his wedding

35:07.987 --> 35:09.487
and tried to abduct his woman.

35:09.489 --> 35:10.988
Is this you helping?

35:10.990 --> 35:13.558
But the point is, he couldn't
kill somebody if he tried,

35:13.560 --> 35:14.892
so you got nothing to worry about.

35:14.894 --> 35:16.093
There's a blasting cap in the C-4.

35:16.095 --> 35:17.094
You want me to pull it out?

35:17.096 --> 35:18.095
No, don't.

35:18.097 --> 35:19.130
Don't. There's a sensor on it.

35:19.132 --> 35:20.832
Can he cut the wire to the switch?

35:20.834 --> 35:22.400
Cut either wire to either module

35:22.402 --> 35:24.502
and it will complete the circuit.

35:24.504 --> 35:25.703
I don't like my options.

35:25.705 --> 35:29.106
There might be a way, but it's... risky.

35:29.108 --> 35:30.975
The wires to the main switch...

35:30.977 --> 35:32.877
cut them both at the same time,

35:32.879 --> 35:37.248
And I mean, like... the exact same time.

35:37.250 --> 35:40.218
Anna... we can do this.

35:40.220 --> 35:44.055
Just keep your mind on Maddox...

35:44.057 --> 35:45.990
because you're gonna be with
him before you know it.

35:45.992 --> 35:47.525
Okay?

35:47.527 --> 35:48.993
On one...

35:48.995 --> 35:51.229
two...

35:53.532 --> 35:55.233
three.

35:57.569 --> 35:58.569
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

35:58.571 --> 36:00.104
Very good, sir.

36:00.106 --> 36:01.138
Very good.

36:05.811 --> 36:08.312
SCOTTIE: Howard was my inspiration...

36:08.314 --> 36:12.149
my partner, my friend.

36:12.151 --> 36:14.418
Standing next to him, you felt like...

36:14.420 --> 36:19.824
no matter what the day brought,
nothing was gonna touch you.

36:19.826 --> 36:22.860
You've been told we lost our son.

36:22.862 --> 36:27.164
He was on the beach one
moment and gone the next.

36:30.235 --> 36:32.270
Well, that's not true.

36:33.372 --> 36:35.206
<i>We</i> didn't lose Christopher.

36:36.875 --> 36:39.176
I did.

36:39.178 --> 36:42.113
He was with me when it happened.

36:42.115 --> 36:45.716
And when I told Howard...

36:45.718 --> 36:50.388
he held me, told me he loved me.

36:50.390 --> 36:52.390
Howard never blamed me.

36:52.392 --> 36:56.994
And he never gave up
hope we'd find our son.

36:58.964 --> 37:01.399
My hope is that...

37:01.401 --> 37:07.104
he's finally found him and
that, when my time comes,

37:07.106 --> 37:10.908
we'll all be together
in the next life...

37:10.910 --> 37:12.810
further on up the road.

37:29.461 --> 37:31.796
I don't know if you're
right about Scottie.

37:35.467 --> 37:38.235
The preliminary report from the NTSB

37:38.237 --> 37:42.340
showing that the fuel system on
my jet had been tampered with.

37:44.409 --> 37:46.077
She tried to have me killed.

37:46.079 --> 37:48.813
I just came from your funeral.

37:48.815 --> 37:50.648
She spoke about you.

37:50.650 --> 37:52.016
She seemed...

37:52.018 --> 37:54.685
devastated.

37:54.687 --> 37:56.087
She must be pretty good.

37:56.089 --> 37:59.223
There's something else you need to see.

37:59.225 --> 38:00.725
(LOCK DISENGAGES)

38:02.361 --> 38:05.763
After you disappeared...

38:05.765 --> 38:06.964
Scottie and I...

38:09.701 --> 38:12.737
we shared a living hell.

38:12.739 --> 38:14.271
We...

38:14.273 --> 38:17.341
searched, we cried, we searched more,

38:17.343 --> 38:20.311
and then, gradually...

38:20.313 --> 38:21.612
she healed.

38:21.614 --> 38:23.914
At first, I was angry at her for...

38:23.916 --> 38:26.250
for being able to do that.

38:26.252 --> 38:30.654
And then I realized, it
wasn't anger, it was envy.

38:30.656 --> 38:33.691
Because that was something
I was not able to do.

38:33.693 --> 38:36.727
I never stopped obsessing and believing

38:36.729 --> 38:38.696
that you were out there somewhere.

38:41.233 --> 38:44.668
I made finding you my life's work.

38:44.670 --> 38:47.505
And that search...

38:47.507 --> 38:49.607
that quest

38:49.609 --> 38:51.609
raised questions about your mother.

38:51.611 --> 38:53.310
How did she come into my life and why?

38:53.312 --> 38:58.115
She had been using me and my
company from the beginning.

38:58.117 --> 38:59.850
And when I confronted her about that,

38:59.852 --> 39:01.218
she used my obsession with you

39:01.220 --> 39:02.853
to make it appear as if I was crazy.

39:02.855 --> 39:05.256
She tried to have me pushed out

39:05.258 --> 39:07.558
not because I was insane,

39:07.560 --> 39:11.796
but because I had stumbled
onto some larger truth.

39:12.964 --> 39:14.065
What truth?

39:21.139 --> 39:22.673
What the hell is Whitehall?

39:22.675 --> 39:25.142
Don't you see? It's all connected.

39:25.144 --> 39:27.044
Your disappearance 30 years ago,

39:27.046 --> 39:29.146
her trying to have me
declared incompetent,

39:29.148 --> 39:30.681
downing the jet to have me killed.

39:30.683 --> 39:33.050
She had me declared legally dead today.

39:33.052 --> 39:34.985
Scottie Hargrave is now in charge

39:34.987 --> 39:38.122
of a global intelligence
gathering operation.

39:38.124 --> 39:40.191
And she's gonna use that network

39:40.193 --> 39:43.494
for the benefit of...

39:43.496 --> 39:45.729
something terrible.

39:49.067 --> 39:50.801
I didn't know if I would ever find you,

39:50.803 --> 39:52.870
and if I did, I didn't
know who you would be.

39:52.872 --> 39:54.772
But here you are...

39:54.774 --> 39:57.141
and without any help
from your parents...

39:57.143 --> 39:59.677
an incredibly gifted operative.

39:59.679 --> 40:01.378
I don't think that's a coincidence.

40:01.380 --> 40:04.815
I believe that we were all put
on this earth for a purpose.

40:04.817 --> 40:07.685
And I believe that your purpose, Tom,

40:07.687 --> 40:09.987
is to go undercover in your own family,

40:09.989 --> 40:12.356
find out what your mother has planned,

40:12.358 --> 40:14.625
and stop her.

40:20.365 --> 40:22.500
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

40:22.502 --> 40:24.969
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

40:24.971 --> 40:27.404
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

40:28.940 --> 40:31.942
She sells seashells by the seashore.

40:34.045 --> 40:37.214
My mom loved tongue twisters.

40:37.216 --> 40:40.551
Seashells, pickled peppers.

40:40.553 --> 40:42.453
It's one of my only memories of her.

40:42.455 --> 40:44.088
She passed away?

40:44.090 --> 40:45.489
Yeah.

40:45.491 --> 40:46.724
When I was a little boy.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.295
Sometimes life just really sucks.

40:51.297 --> 40:53.364
(SNIFFLES)

40:53.366 --> 40:56.400
Told you I'd only work one job, but...

40:56.402 --> 40:57.968
but I changed my mind.

40:57.970 --> 41:00.804
Good. You start tomorrow.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.806
That's it?

41:02.808 --> 41:05.142
No questions asked?

41:05.144 --> 41:06.112
You have your reasons.

41:06.114 --> 41:08.948
Sooner or later, I'll
know what they are.

41:09.315 --> 41:12.016
I don't know if I should
be thrilled or terrified.

41:13.718 --> 41:15.753
Maybe it should be a little of both.

41:18.723 --> 41:20.119
Welcome to the family.
