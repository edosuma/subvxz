00:02.627 --> 00:04.503
Hey, you guys, guess what?

00:04.671 --> 00:06.922
Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.592
What is the matter with you?

00:12.804 --> 00:15.097
No. Barry and Mindy.

00:15.265 --> 00:18.559
Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce,"
I immediately go to Ross. Heh.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.437
Who's Barry and Mindy?

00:21.604 --> 00:24.940
Barry was the guy I almost married,
and Mindy was my best friend.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.775
Wasn't he cheating on you with her?

00:26.943 --> 00:30.404
That just means he was falling
asleep on top of her instead of me.

00:31.906 --> 00:35.743
Can you imagine if I'd married him?
How different would my life be?

00:35.994 --> 00:38.871
I know. I've always wondered
how different life would be...

00:39.039 --> 00:40.789
...if I'd never gotten divorced.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.916
- Which time?
- The first time!

00:44.044 --> 00:47.171
Imagine if Carol hadn't realized
she was a lesbian.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.718
I can't.
I keep seeing it the good way.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.430
I bet I'd still be doing my karate.

00:57.974 --> 01:02.770
Towards the end of our marriage, I did
karate as a way of releasing the tension...

01:03.021 --> 01:06.190
...from, you know,
not doing anything else physical.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.859
Maybe the problem was
pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."

01:10.445 --> 01:12.237
What if I was still fat?

01:12.405 --> 01:14.823
You wouldn't be dating me,
that's for sure.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.366
Sure I would.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.370
What? You guys think I'm that shallow?

01:20.538 --> 01:22.289
No, I think Monica was that fat.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.961
Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired
off Days of Our Lives.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.464
Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.885
What if I had had the guts
to quit my job?

01:35.053 --> 01:38.847
I'd probably be writing for The New
Yorker, being paid to be funny.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.059
But my job's fun too.
I mean, tomorrow...

01:42.310 --> 01:44.228
...I don't have to wear a tie.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.856
What if I'd taken that job
at Merrill Lynch?

01:48.024 --> 01:50.067
- What?
- Merrill Lynch?

01:50.235 --> 01:54.571
A massage client who worked there
said I had a knack for stocks.

01:54.739 --> 01:55.948
Why didn't you take it?

01:56.116 --> 01:59.743
At that time, you see, I thought that
everything that rhymed was true.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.995
So I thought if I worked with stocks...

02:02.163 --> 02:06.583
...I'd have to live in a box
and only eat lox and have a pet fox.

02:08.127 --> 02:12.881
Do you think if all those things
happened, we'd still hang out?

02:58.928 --> 03:00.596
Oh, my God. Rachel Green?

03:00.763 --> 03:02.973
Aah! Rob Tilman!

03:03.141 --> 03:06.351
No, heh, no, it's me. Ross.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.730
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tilman.

03:10.815 --> 03:15.694
- No. No, no. Ross Geller.
- Of course! Monica's brother.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.530
- Yeah. Right.
- Wow! How are you?

03:18.698 --> 03:23.118
- Good. Good, I'm married.
- Oh! Me too! Ha, ha.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.580
- Isn't it the best?
- Oh, it's the best. Heh.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.669
- So, um, how's Monica?
- Really, really great.

03:32.837 --> 03:37.674
Actually, she's right down the street.
Um, you should stop by and say hi.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.594
- Oh, I would love to.
- Yeah, she'd be so excited.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.262
- Oh, okay.
- Come on.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.181
Wait, don't you have to pay for...

03:44.349 --> 03:46.350
...Busty Ladies?

03:48.853 --> 03:53.315
No, that's okay. Some kid asked me
to pick it up for him, but I...

04:01.824 --> 04:05.494
So, Monica,
still going out with Dr. Boring, huh?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.748
He's not boring. He's just...

04:12.335 --> 04:14.086
He's just low-key.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.339
- Here you go, one hazelnut latte.
- Thank you.

04:17.507 --> 04:21.176
You know, the hazelnut,
actually not a nut.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.679
It's a seed.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.597
Wow.

04:26.474 --> 04:31.228
Can anyone else name a well-known seed
that's been masquerading as a nut?

04:31.396 --> 04:34.064
Oh, dear God. Let me think.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.650
Hey.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.986
Oh, no. What's the matter?

04:39.153 --> 04:40.696
I got another rejection letter.

04:40.863 --> 04:44.449
They said my writing was funny,
just not "Archie Comic funny."

04:45.952 --> 04:47.744
I gotta get back to the hospital.

04:47.912 --> 04:48.954
- All right.
- Okay.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.622
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

04:50.999 --> 04:55.460
Oh, uh, by the way, the answer is
the Brazil nut.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.925
Was his question,
"What's more boring than him?"

05:02.552 --> 05:04.970
Hey, man.
Sorry about that Archie thing.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.847
You, uh, need me
to give you some money?

05:07.015 --> 05:10.225
Hey, I may have no money,
but I still have my pride.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.811
Really?

05:14.689 --> 05:15.856
Eh.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.443
Joey doesn't have to give you money.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.529
- TV stars have assistants, right?
- That's an idea.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.866
If I hire an assistant,
would you take money from her?

05:26.326 --> 05:29.244
No, Joey.
Chandler could be your assistant.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.663
He could answer
your fan mail and stuff.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.498
That would be great! Let's do that!

05:33.666 --> 05:36.126
I could use the money.
Give me time to write.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.086
- Great! Welcome aboard.
- Okay!

05:38.254 --> 05:40.505
All right. I need to use the bathroom.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.675
Since I don't need assistance
in there, take a break!

05:43.843 --> 05:45.218
All right.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.680
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.848
- Guess what?
- What?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.600
Joey just hired Chandler.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.393
Oh, that's so sweet.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.396
Oh! Hang on!

05:56.564 --> 05:58.899
Hang on!

06:01.194 --> 06:02.361
Go!

06:03.404 --> 06:06.448
No. No, no.
I said sell when it hits 50!

06:06.699 --> 06:10.285
Five-oh! It's a number!
It comes after four-nine!

06:10.995 --> 06:14.456
No, it's okay. It's okay.
You're allowed one mistake.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.750
Just kidding. You are of course fired.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.379
Ugh.

06:20.546 --> 06:21.671
- Hey, Mon?
- Hey.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.840
Mon, look who I ran into.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.635
Oh, my God, Rachel!

06:30.473 --> 06:33.392
- God, you look terrific!
- Oh, so do you!

06:33.559 --> 06:34.893
Thanks.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.355
- Did you lose weight?
- You are so sweet to notice.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.190
Yes, I lost 3 and a half pounds.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.566
Ah!

06:43.945 --> 06:46.822
- You remember my friend Chandler?
- Hi.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.199
- And that's Phoebe.
- Hi.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.994
Sit down. Sit down. How long's it
been since we've seen each other?

06:53.162 --> 06:56.915
1987, the day after Christmas.
Uh, Sean McMahan's party.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.628
I played you one of my songs.
"Interplanetary Courtship Ritual."

07:03.131 --> 07:05.799
Oh, yeah. Right.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.344
- So, now, do you still do music?
- Well, sometimes.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.180
- Sometime I'll play you...
- Oh, my God!

07:12.432 --> 07:17.727
Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives
just walked in here!

07:17.895 --> 07:22.774
- Rach, he's a friend of ours.
- You are friends with Dr. Drake Ramoray?

07:24.569 --> 07:26.361
It's hard to be friends with Drake...

07:26.529 --> 07:30.282
...because of his busy schedule
and the fact that he's not real.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.203
Hey, or I could bring
my keyboard here sometime.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.913
- He's coming over.
- Joey?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.498
I know. Here, here.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.958
Oh.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.962
No. This is my friend Rachel.
We went to high school together.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.797
- Ha, ha, hi.
- Hi.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.049
I...

07:48.718 --> 07:50.719
I love you on that show.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.762
- Oh.
- I watch you every day.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.974
When you took out your
kidney to save your ex-wife...

07:56.225 --> 07:58.935
...even though
she tried to kill you...

07:59.729 --> 08:01.646
It's always nice to meet fans.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.192
- She's not crazy, is she?
- No.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.737
So, uh, how you doing?

08:16.370 --> 08:18.079
Hang on.

08:18.289 --> 08:21.666
Hang on. Hang on.

08:22.793 --> 08:23.835
Go!

08:24.170 --> 08:25.420
Who's this?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.714
Oh, you're gonna like working for me.

08:27.965 --> 08:31.801
What's your name?
What kind of name is Brindy?

08:31.969 --> 08:33.678
I... Uh, whatever.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.554
Stop talking.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.975
All right, from now on
your name is Joan.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.477
You can pick your own last name.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.066
- Hey, there you are.
- Uh-oh, it's my boss.

08:46.234 --> 08:49.486
All right, here's a list of things
for you to do today.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.947
This is gonna be so great.
Thank you so much.

08:52.198 --> 08:56.368
I gotta go to work. I'm delivering
twins, but only one of them is mine.

09:01.249 --> 09:05.252
"Drop off my dry cleaning.
Pick up my vitamins."

09:05.920 --> 09:07.712
Teach me how to spell vitamins.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.800
"Wear in my new jeans."

09:13.594 --> 09:15.929
- You realize what you are, don't you?
- What?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.722
You're his bitch.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.643
No, no! No!

09:21.978 --> 09:24.437
Wait! You didn't sit on my
Kit Kats did you?

09:24.855 --> 09:28.066
No, there was a little,
little dip in the market...

09:28.234 --> 09:30.277
...and I lost $13 million.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.571
But the Kit Kats are all right?

09:33.489 --> 09:36.366
What am I gonna do?
I can't call my office, they'll kill me.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.703
I can't call my clients,
they'll kill themselves!

09:39.954 --> 09:42.455
- All right, now my chest hurts.
- What?

09:42.623 --> 09:45.166
My chest hurts. Ugh.

09:45.334 --> 09:50.005
- Ugh! And now, I can't breathe.
- Are you having a heart attack?

09:50.172 --> 09:53.842
If I were, would I have shooting
pains up and down my left arm?

09:54.010 --> 09:56.970
- Yes.
- Then, yes. That is what I'm having.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.847
Oh, my God!

10:04.186 --> 10:06.646
Come on, Pheebs, it's not that bad.

10:06.814 --> 10:10.066
Most people'd be excited if they
didn't work for a couple weeks.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.278
Most people don't like their jobs.
I love my job.

10:13.529 --> 10:17.616
I've been not working for three hours,
and I'm already going crazy.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.409
I miss Joan.

10:20.745 --> 10:24.331
Honey, a heart attack is nature's
way of telling you to slow down.

10:24.582 --> 10:28.418
I always thought it was nature's way
of telling you to die. Heh.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.421
You're not gonna die.

10:31.672 --> 10:35.967
I mean, you are going to die,
but you're not gonna die today.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.427
I wish I was dead.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.347
Let's take a walk.

10:40.556 --> 10:44.309
You should consider writing for
Talking Out of Your Ass magazine.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.564
So what's going on with you?

10:50.149 --> 10:54.944
Well, um, I've been doing a lot more
of my karate.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.907
- Still a dry spell with Carol?
- Yeah.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.618
How long has it been since
you've had sex?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.913
- Well, last weekend...
- That's not so bad.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.874
...will be two months...

11:08.250 --> 11:11.002
...since I stopped trying.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.005
You need to spice things up.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.715
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

11:15.883 --> 11:19.219
You could tie her up.
You could eat stuff off each other.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.512
Oh.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.349
- Dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys.
- Wow.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.727
Role-playing.
You're warden, she's prisoner.

11:27.978 --> 11:31.481
- You're the pirate, she's the wench.
- Okay, I think I got it.

11:31.649 --> 11:35.527
You could be two stockbrokers,
rolling naked on the trading floor...

11:35.778 --> 11:37.779
...and everybody's watching.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.157
It never happened.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.957
And over there is Brady's Pub...

11:49.166 --> 11:52.127
...where I unwind
after a long day of "surgeoning."

11:52.378 --> 11:55.046
Wow! This is so amazing. What else?

11:55.297 --> 11:58.341
Well, that is a large piece
of television equipment.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.260
And, uh, that is an old man.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.095
- Hey, old man!
- Hey.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.557
Alrighty. What do you say we head
back to my place?

12:05.725 --> 12:11.312
Well, wow. Um, you know,
I would really love to, but I shouldn't.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.817
Why?
Why can't the world stop turning?

12:16.944 --> 12:20.029
Just for a moment. Just for us.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.324
Isn't that a line from the show?

12:24.660 --> 12:27.579
Uh, yeah, but, uh...

12:27.747 --> 12:30.749
...I may have said
those things before, but...

12:30.916 --> 12:35.211
...I never truly meant them until now.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.298
That's a line from the show too!

12:39.508 --> 12:41.092
Okay, you watch too much TV.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.679
Joe, here's the freshly-squeezed
orange juice you asked for.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.055
- Thanks.
- Hi.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.558
Yeah, there's pulp in that.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.854
- Yeah?
- Heh.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.649
I thought we talked about this.
I don't like pulp.

12:56.817 --> 13:00.278
No pulp. Pulp isn't juice.
All juice. Okay?

13:00.446 --> 13:03.573
I'm sorry. I guess I just like the pulp.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.285
God, I'm sorry. I am being so rude.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.121
Rachel, would you like a soda
or something?

13:10.372 --> 13:14.167
Because Chandler will
run right out and get it.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.295
Yeah, well, sure,
iced tea would be great.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.755
Iced tea.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.302
Okay. Anything for you, sir?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.971
Did I not just tell him?

13:28.724 --> 13:31.392
Okay, look, Chandler,
if this is gonna work...

13:31.644 --> 13:35.396
...you have got to listen.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.152
You're gonna throw that juice at me,
aren't you?

13:41.320 --> 13:42.654
It's not all juice.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.620
Honey, this morning was fun, huh?

13:50.788 --> 13:54.457
Me hopping in on you
in the shower there?

13:54.625 --> 13:58.336
Yeah, maybe someday we could get
a place with two bathrooms.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.510
Look, Carol, um, I was thinking maybe...

14:05.719 --> 14:08.596
...maybe we can spice things
up a little.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.100
- What do you mean?
- Carol, our sex life. It's just not...

14:12.309 --> 14:15.854
- Dad!
- Hey there, little fella!

14:16.021 --> 14:17.981
Hey, why don't we get
some shoes on you?

14:18.148 --> 14:21.276
Show Dad how you
put your shoes on in your room.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.444
- Yay!
- Yay!

14:24.029 --> 14:25.113
Yay!

14:25.698 --> 14:27.824
Seriously, our sex life.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.160
I was thinking maybe, I don't know...

14:31.328 --> 14:34.205
...we could try some new things,
you know, for fun.

14:34.373 --> 14:38.042
- Like what?
- Well, I don't know. Um...

14:39.753 --> 14:42.213
What if we, uh, were to...

14:43.132 --> 14:45.133
...tie each other up?

14:52.224 --> 14:56.728
Um, some people eat stuff
off one another.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.981
Yeah.

15:00.232 --> 15:04.402
Um, you know, we could try dirty talk.
Uh, heh.

15:05.821 --> 15:09.949
- Um, we could have a threesome.
- I love that idea!

15:13.329 --> 15:15.079
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?

15:15.247 --> 15:18.583
Oh, my God, that's so great.
Oh, wow!

15:19.209 --> 15:22.086
You're a published writer.
I wish I had a present.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.963
- Aw.
- Wait a minute.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.509
My last Kit Kat bar.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.391
- You want to share it?
- Okay!

15:37.519 --> 15:38.978
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.898
Chandler, I know you're mad.
I'm sorry.

15:42.149 --> 15:46.653
I was a total jerk.
Completely over the line.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.905
I just... I hate pulp.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.034
You know how Monica feels
about low-fat mayonnaise?

15:53.202 --> 15:55.495
It's not mayonnaise!

15:56.538 --> 16:01.668
Okay, uh, anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, and here.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.672
- What's this?
- Fresh-squeezed orange juice, with pulp.

16:05.839 --> 16:09.384
- Just the way you like.
- Aw, thanks, man.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.099
Hey, Joey? Chandler sold a story
to Archie Comics.

16:16.266 --> 16:19.519
Oh, my God, that's great! Congratulations!
What's the story?

16:19.687 --> 16:23.022
Oh, you wouldn't care.
It's just a stupid comic book story.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.776
Are you kidding me?
I love Archie and the whole gang.

16:28.946 --> 16:33.574
Well, um, Archie needs money
to fix his jalopy.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.790
Uh, but he doesn't want Reggie
to just give him the money.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.668
So Reggie hires him as his assist...

16:45.921 --> 16:47.755
As his butler.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.174
And makes him do crazy things...

16:50.426 --> 16:53.803
...like bring him milk shakes
that can't have lumps.

16:55.764 --> 16:59.100
Wait a minute.
That sounds a little familiar.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.604
Did they already do that?
I think I read it!

17:08.068 --> 17:10.611
Monica, listen. I have to ask.

17:10.863 --> 17:15.074
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back
to his apartment.

17:15.284 --> 17:20.288
- Does he do this with a lot of girls?
- Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.123
Ah! And I'm one of them.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.751
Wow.

17:24.917 --> 17:29.464
I just cannot believe this.
I mean, Joey Tribbiani.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.091
It's none of my business,
but aren't you married?

17:32.342 --> 17:33.634
Yeah.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.098
I wish we could just not be married
for a little bit.

17:39.349 --> 17:43.227
You know, I just wish we could be,
like, on a break.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.107
Well, you're not.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.819
It's easy for you. You get to
have sex with whoever you want.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.654
Yeah, I can. Ha.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.616
Don't think I don't. I do.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.868
I mean, all the time. You bet!

18:01.205 --> 18:03.247
- Monica?
- Hmm?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.542
You've done it, right?

18:08.504 --> 18:13.466
Of course I have. What do you think,
I'm like some 30-year-old virgin?

18:13.634 --> 18:17.053
Oh, my God.
You're a 30-year-old virgin.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.516
Louder. I don't think
the guy in the back heard.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.476
Yeah, I heard it.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.689
It's not like I haven't had
the opportunity.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.983
- I'm waiting for the perfect guy.
- Mm-hm.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.861
I'm seeing this guy Roger.
He's not perfect...

18:34.029 --> 18:36.656
...but, uh, I'm thinking maybe
I should get it over with.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.908
You know, give him my flower.

18:40.661 --> 18:46.374
Oh, my God, do it!
Honey, you've waited long enough.

18:46.583 --> 18:51.212
- You know what? You are right.
- Sex does not have to be a big deal.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.340
There shouldn't be all these
rules and restrictions.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.677
People should be able to sleep
with whoever, whenever...

18:57.928 --> 19:01.556
Rachel. I'm never gonna think it's okay
for you to cheat on your husband.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.516
Oh, what do you know, virgin?

19:10.065 --> 19:11.232
Phoebe?

19:11.441 --> 19:14.443
Why is smoke coming out
of the bathroom?

19:14.611 --> 19:18.406
Oh, yeah. The doctor said
that could be one of the side effects.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.284
Put the cigarette out.

19:21.451 --> 19:25.538
No, it's not a cigarette.
The smoke is coming out of me!

19:25.706 --> 19:28.749
- Put it out.
- Okay, okay!

19:31.086 --> 19:34.130
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Come on.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.717
- I got it. I got it.
- Give it to me! Give it!

19:43.098 --> 19:44.390
Hello?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.976
No, she can't come to the phone now.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.688
Oh, right. No problem.
Okay, bye-bye.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.357
Was it work? Were they mad?
Was it Jack? Did he yell?

19:53.525 --> 19:56.027
No, just relax. Nobody yelled.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.946
Jack was making sure you
were getting better.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.656
Thank God.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.575
Yeah, she's fired.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.081
You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.292
You've got to let her go.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.046
Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.257
Not so fast, Wesley.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.763
- Ramoray.
- That's right, Wesley.

20:23.931 --> 20:28.643
I just stopped by to say
that you're not a real doctor.

20:28.810 --> 20:32.188
And that woman's brain is fine.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.066
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.

20:42.658 --> 20:46.786
- Hope? Hope?
- Drake.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.371
You're not dying, Hope.

20:48.538 --> 20:52.583
You're gonna live a long,
healthy life. With me.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.377
Oh, Drake.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.716
Okay.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.385
Here we go.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.429
Okay. Ahem.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.515
Mm.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.477
Hi, Joey? It's Rachel.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.897
Um, I am free tomorrow night.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.568
Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some
sandwiches.
