00:22.315 --> 00:24.651
- [gun cocking]
- [Zip] Got that John Blaze shit.

00:25.569 --> 00:27.195
Forget about making somebody's day.

00:27.278 --> 00:29.113
These two Desert Eagles here?

00:31.575 --> 00:33.785
Fly, pelican, fly.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.795
Do I even need to say it?

00:47.256 --> 00:48.424
[chuckles]

00:52.596 --> 00:54.681
[sighs] Come on, Zip.

00:54.764 --> 00:57.100
You should find a new profession.

00:57.183 --> 00:58.768
Cottonmouth is done.

00:59.769 --> 01:01.062
You ain't heard?

01:01.145 --> 01:05.399
Cottonmouth's getting out,
so you ain't done shit.

01:05.483 --> 01:06.776
Boom!

01:33.386 --> 01:34.846
[inaudible]

01:41.978 --> 01:43.021
[Audrey] Detective.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.857
Remember who you are.

01:45.940 --> 01:50.779
Next time, it would behoove you
to have actual evidence.

01:50.862 --> 01:52.321
You know, something besides

01:52.405 --> 01:54.741
the dogged harassment
of a misguided beat cop.

01:54.824 --> 01:56.284
You calling me a dog?

01:56.367 --> 01:59.412
No, I believe the brother said "dogged,"

01:59.495 --> 02:01.330
as in determined.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.499
Although, true...

02:04.417 --> 02:07.586
the word is derived from the description
of a dog's persistence.

02:09.923 --> 02:11.841
See, that's the problem with a bitch.

02:13.134 --> 02:16.262
Once they get their mouth on a bone...

02:16.345 --> 02:17.722
they can't let go.

02:19.849 --> 02:23.269
We'll see who's somebody's bitch

02:23.352 --> 02:25.897
when your ass is in prison...

02:27.273 --> 02:28.607
Cornell.

02:30.276 --> 02:31.695
[chuckles]

02:33.446 --> 02:35.573
[Stokes chuckling]

02:40.203 --> 02:41.412
[woman] There he is!

02:41.495 --> 02:43.707
[reporters clamoring]

03:31.045 --> 03:33.047
[theme music playing]

04:42.116 --> 04:44.786
[newscaster] <i>Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes'</i>
<i>release this morning</i>

04:44.869 --> 04:46.454
<i>was a blow to local law enforcement...</i>

04:46.537 --> 04:48.622
[Stokes laughing]

04:50.541 --> 04:52.418
Mariah ain't gonna like that shit.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.920
Neither should you.

04:54.003 --> 04:56.630
I just shot a cop and walked away free.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.092
What's there not to like?

04:59.175 --> 05:02.720
Zip and Amos picked up the truck
from the docks right after I shot Scarfe.

05:04.055 --> 05:06.765
Domingo got his guns back last night.

05:06.850 --> 05:08.726
Everyone else will fall in line.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.313
Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.481
Hell...

05:14.398 --> 05:15.859
even the Koreans.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.861
All loyal.

05:19.112 --> 05:20.654
We're all good.

05:23.908 --> 05:25.159
So...

05:27.203 --> 05:29.038
when do I get my Judas?

05:30.039 --> 05:31.124
You don't.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.334
You're too hot right now.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.129
Luke Cage is a luxury, Cornell.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.008
He's, uh... he's ice cream.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.011
And you need to keep steak on the table.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.514
And how do I do that
with Luke Cage around?

05:48.182 --> 05:50.851
All he has to do is [shouting] show up

05:50.935 --> 05:54.147
and hoods scatter
like roaches with the lights on!

05:54.230 --> 05:59.068
Guns, drugs, all street traffic
is a mess right now because of him!

05:59.152 --> 06:00.987
[breathing heavily]

06:04.490 --> 06:06.575
Niggas act like he can walk on water.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.619
Can he?

06:12.290 --> 06:14.125
I'm done talking, Shades.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.131
Tell Diamondback I need
to holler at him.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.801
You sure that's the way
you want to play this?

06:26.762 --> 06:27.931
Okay.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.699
[door closes]

07:34.705 --> 07:37.083
So what about all that evidence?

07:38.334 --> 07:40.794
Without Scarfe to corroborate,
that ledger is useless.

07:41.712 --> 07:42.796
Even the whole thing with Spurlock

07:42.880 --> 07:45.341
and the bodies Cottonmouth
burned there won't stick.

07:46.384 --> 07:48.719
Spurlock is going to eat the charge
and take the years.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.430
He won't testify.

07:51.514 --> 07:54.350
He'd be his own client. [sighs]

07:55.893 --> 07:57.311
[Claire] So that's it?

07:59.605 --> 08:01.149
Setbacks happen all the time.

08:01.232 --> 08:03.651
You can still do something about this.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.111
Why me?

08:05.694 --> 08:09.157
Because you're not afraid of Cottonmouth,
and he's obviously afraid of you.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.284
What do you expect me to do?

08:11.784 --> 08:14.203
I tried to do things the right way.
Cops let him go.

08:14.287 --> 08:17.081
Cops can only do so much.

08:17.165 --> 08:19.083
You have the power to do more.

08:19.167 --> 08:20.793
Look at what's happening
in Hell's Kitchen.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.837
You mean that cat running
around beating people up?

08:23.921 --> 08:25.131
That's what you want me to be?

08:25.589 --> 08:28.884
Sometimes, if you want justice...

08:28.967 --> 08:30.469
you have to get it yourself.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.767
If Hell's Kitchen's so great,
why'd you run uptown?

08:38.019 --> 08:39.227
Why did you?

08:40.145 --> 08:42.315
There is nothing that can hurt you.

08:42.398 --> 08:44.858
So what the hell are you afraid of?

08:46.110 --> 08:47.570
[phone ringing]

08:58.831 --> 09:00.333
[Fish] Pop's Barber Shop.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.379
It's for you.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.923
[Stokes on phone] <i>Let's parley.</i>

09:09.007 --> 09:11.469
Either we can be gentlemen about this...

09:12.386 --> 09:14.222
or we can get into some gangster shit.

09:15.181 --> 09:16.890
Parley's just fine.

09:18.059 --> 09:20.894
Your gangster shit hasn't worked out
so well for you recently.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.563
[chuckles]

09:22.646 --> 09:24.022
Harlem's Paradise.

09:25.066 --> 09:26.317
Bring your apron.

09:27.235 --> 09:29.403
[laughing]

09:32.198 --> 09:33.324
[hangs up phone]

09:35.534 --> 09:36.535
What'd he say?

09:40.581 --> 09:41.915
Enough.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.176
Might as well take all that down now.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.888
No. There's still plenty of work
to be done.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.391
Not for me.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.185
They just made it official an hour ago.

10:01.269 --> 10:03.771
But you had nothing to do with Scarfe.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.524
My shop, my watch.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.694
[inaudible]

10:10.778 --> 10:12.821
All right, here we go.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.199
You've got to play this smart, Detective.

10:15.283 --> 10:17.410
IA's gonna be up your ass
with a flashlight.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.537
I can handle Ridley.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.123
She was my lieutenant at the 31st.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.875
Listen, you still have
a future here, Misty.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.919
My advice to you
is to let go of this board

10:27.002 --> 10:28.837
and everyone you have pinned on it.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.882
Cottonmouth needs to be in handcuffs.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.636
Don't let this twist you to the point
where you can't see which way is up.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.279
[exhales]

10:54.947 --> 10:56.324
Mercedes?

10:57.950 --> 10:59.285
Priscilla.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.664
I prefer Inspector Ridley.

11:04.582 --> 11:06.792
Priscilla, I heard they started
calling you Inspector Gadget

11:06.875 --> 11:09.920
- behind your back once you got promoted.
- [chuckles]

11:12.047 --> 11:13.757
This is gonna be fun.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.386
[reporters clamoring]

11:20.264 --> 11:22.600
Councilwoman Dillard and I
don't agree on much.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.268
But she's a good woman who loves Harlem,

11:24.352 --> 11:27.480
and I'm a strong believer in party first,
no matter what.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.440
I came as a friend in her time of need.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.318
Mr. Boone, is it true you're here
to ask the councilwoman to resign?

11:32.401 --> 11:34.862
He's here because I asked him here.
Damon.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.905
[all clamoring]

11:36.989 --> 11:38.115
[Mariah] Let him through.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.825
[clamoring continues]

11:40.618 --> 11:42.370
Wait, wait, wait. First question, go.

11:42.453 --> 11:45.080
Was your affordable housing initiative
funded by drug money?

11:45.163 --> 11:49.126
My cousin has never been
accused of selling drugs.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.629
I thought you all said
he was running guns.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.464
- Will you please make up your mind?
- [chuckles]

11:53.547 --> 11:56.759
Councilwoman, have you been questioned
by the NYPD about your cousin?

11:58.844 --> 12:00.429
Family first, Robin.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.557
I love my cousin Cornell Stokes.

12:03.641 --> 12:06.852
The charges against him
are categorically false,

12:06.935 --> 12:08.896
which is why they let him go.

12:08.979 --> 12:12.232
He is an integral part
of my New Harlem Renaissance

12:12.316 --> 12:16.362
and our movement to rebuild
Harlem for our Harlemites.

12:16.445 --> 12:17.446
Okay? That's it.

12:17.530 --> 12:21.116
- Get out of the rain. Go, go!
- [all clamoring]

12:23.452 --> 12:24.537
[clamoring continues]

12:24.620 --> 12:28.416
[Mariah] Ah! This is low...
even for you.

12:28.499 --> 12:31.043
[Boone] I wasn't lying.
I'm here as your friend.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.422
[Mariah] Pretty boy Stanford Carpetbagger.

12:34.505 --> 12:37.508
You've been trying to knock me
off my spot for years.

12:38.426 --> 12:40.260
How much of what they're saying is true?

12:42.596 --> 12:43.806
Damn.

12:44.473 --> 12:45.641
That bad?

12:47.518 --> 12:48.727
You're...

12:49.645 --> 12:51.146
tainted.

12:51.229 --> 12:54.400
And the infection is contagious.

12:55.150 --> 12:58.111
So what do you recommend, Dr. Boone?

12:59.447 --> 13:02.325
You step aside
and let me take your seat.

13:03.326 --> 13:05.243
Then I can support your initiatives
on the inside.

13:05.328 --> 13:06.995
And push your permits through.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.747
A year from now,

13:08.831 --> 13:12.042
all four of your complexes
could be up and running.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.627
That's cute.

13:15.170 --> 13:19.800
You've been trying to knock me
out of my spot for six years, Damon.

13:19.883 --> 13:23.887
It didn't work then.
It's not working now.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.014
Find a new hobby.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.183
You can't stay on top forever, Mariah.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.436
You're gonna fall.

13:31.395 --> 13:34.064
And I'll enjoy every second when you do.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.066
You need to leave now.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.278
Show your Marigny ass out.

13:56.712 --> 13:58.381
[indistinct clamoring]

14:00.132 --> 14:01.258
Do you need anything?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.677
Scotch. Neat.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.309
[Alex] Mariah?

14:14.563 --> 14:16.356
How the hell did you get in here?

14:16.440 --> 14:17.900
We need to talk.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.073
Alone.

14:27.034 --> 14:31.121
So, this Luke Cage
was a bartender at Harlem's Paradise?

14:31.204 --> 14:34.124
Actually, I believe he was the dishwasher.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.043
<i>He was filling in for Dante that night.</i>

14:36.126 --> 14:37.753
[Ridley] <i>One man is linked</i>
<i>to a criminal,</i>

14:37.836 --> 14:40.464
the death of four people,
the destruction of a restaurant,

14:40.548 --> 14:42.007
and you don't find him suspicious?

14:42.090 --> 14:44.009
Of course I do.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.845
[Ridley] <i>Step back.</i>
<i>Take a look at your board.</i>

14:46.929 --> 14:51.892
Who is the one person that is linked
to every single location up there?

14:51.975 --> 14:54.395
It's not just this case
that depends upon on it.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.855
Your career is also in the balance.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.861
[breathing heavily]

15:04.530 --> 15:06.031
Shit.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.115
[bangs]

15:09.201 --> 15:11.244
[Stokes playing keyboard]

15:24.967 --> 15:26.927
[indistinct chatter]

15:40.065 --> 15:42.234
[playing keyboard]

15:42.317 --> 15:45.028
Damn, Cornell, you just playing that,
like, out of thin air like that?

15:45.112 --> 15:46.864
You don't need to, uh, write it down?

15:46.947 --> 15:48.532
I just see it in my head.

15:48.616 --> 15:51.994
[laughing] This boy
is a damn prodigy, Mabel.

15:52.077 --> 15:55.623
That prodigy needs to keep it down.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.415
Mariah's trying to study.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.542
[scoffs] Like a little music

15:58.626 --> 16:00.794
is gonna disturb all that hoein'
you got goin' on over there.

16:00.878 --> 16:03.213
That hoein' is what keeps the lights on.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.422
Look, all I'm saying is that

16:04.507 --> 16:08.844
Cornell should be in one of them schools
like, um... Juilliard.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.805
[Mabel] There's only
one school that matters.

16:11.889 --> 16:14.141
- Cornell is really good.
- [Uncle Pete] Mmm.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.519
[smacks lips]
Did I ask you anything, Little May?

16:16.602 --> 16:17.770
[Uncle Pete] The girl's got a point.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.856
- [Mabel] She don't need you to defend her.
- I know she don't.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.775
Because she's gonna be a lawyer,

16:22.858 --> 16:24.943
and she's gonna be able
to defend her damn self.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.779
Ain't that right, baby?

16:27.696 --> 16:30.824
- Hey, Mariah.
- Snap, crackle, pop!

16:30.908 --> 16:33.451
- How you doing, Henry?
- [young Pop] Good, ma'am.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.622
Hey, yo, Cottonmouth.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.331
- You coming?
- [stops playing]

16:38.415 --> 16:40.125
You know I hate that name.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.419
Well, I could just called you Corny.

16:42.503 --> 16:45.673
- Is that better?
- Hey! He's practicing.

16:45.756 --> 16:47.966
All right? He needs to stay right here.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.635
He needs to get a little dirt on him.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.344
[chuckling]

16:53.639 --> 16:56.058
Actually, Pete's right.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.685
You stay here, Cornell.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.978
You can go.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.648
You stand right here with me.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.991
My husband, his brother, and me...

17:13.909 --> 17:17.494
built this here Harlem game
brick by brick.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.123
Numbers, pussy, guns.

17:20.207 --> 17:25.546
But you know good and goddamn well
the one thing I never sell is drugs.

17:25.628 --> 17:28.966
So what the hell made you go
and do something so stupid?

17:29.675 --> 17:32.510
- I thought I was helping your ass.
- Helping me?

17:34.972 --> 17:36.807
Man, this crack game is blowin' up.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.476
Salvador Colon and all them,
they making mad loot,

17:39.560 --> 17:41.895
and your old ass is getting left...
[yelps]

17:41.979 --> 17:43.355
[screaming]

17:45.107 --> 17:46.775
[wailing]

17:50.528 --> 17:52.948
Finish your studies upstairs, baby girl.

17:54.282 --> 17:57.369
Uh-uh, not you.
You stay right there, Cornell.

17:57.452 --> 18:00.080
[Donnie wails and whimpers]

18:00.163 --> 18:03.917
And your dumb ass ain't inventive enough
to think of some shit like this.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.254
Who gave you this idea, huh?

18:07.337 --> 18:09.047
[Uncle Pete] Who the hell
are you looking at?

18:09.131 --> 18:10.215
Hmm?

18:11.383 --> 18:13.010
[Mabel] Take out this trash, Cornell.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.595
No.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.180
Cornell ain't ready
for nothing like this, Maybelline.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.643
Well, he need to learn
how to piss standing up.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.812
[sighs]

18:25.063 --> 18:27.107
[panting]

18:30.193 --> 18:31.612
- [Uncle Pete] Come on, nigga!
- [Donnie yelling]

18:31.695 --> 18:33.321
Cornell, you go with your Uncle Pete.

18:33.405 --> 18:34.657
[Uncle Pete] Stand up!

18:34.740 --> 18:36.659
- And keep it down.
- [Donnie whimpering]

18:36.742 --> 18:39.620
I got white folks in the front room.
I don't want to scare 'em off.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.246
[door closing]

18:41.329 --> 18:43.165
- [blows landing]
- [Uncle Pete grunting]

18:43.248 --> 18:45.083
[muffled yells and screams]

18:52.424 --> 18:54.384
[Donnie] Please! Please! I'm sorry!

18:54.467 --> 18:55.552
[Donnie screaming]

19:09.900 --> 19:11.652
[Stokes playing keyboard]

19:14.112 --> 19:15.698
[breath trembling]

19:21.328 --> 19:23.121
[inhales deeply]

19:38.178 --> 19:39.805
[knuckles cracking]

19:41.223 --> 19:43.892
[Luke] Even though I hate your ass...

19:45.936 --> 19:47.187
I gotta admit...

19:48.438 --> 19:49.940
you got talent.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.443
You could have been somebody.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.783
This is the first time I've ever seen
you flunky-free.

20:00.701 --> 20:04.496
I guess now that you're untouchable...
you don't need them.

20:06.999 --> 20:08.125
So, what?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.211
You here to take me in or take me out?

20:11.294 --> 20:12.379
Hey.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.715
You called me.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.635
And unlike you, I'm not a murderer.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.013
I'm taking you in.

20:21.096 --> 20:24.349
You're gonna sit down with Misty Knight
and you're going to confess...

20:24.432 --> 20:26.059
to everything.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.686
That's what you think's about to happen?

20:30.313 --> 20:32.900
'Cause last time I checked...

20:34.276 --> 20:36.444
you were no longer a sheriff...

20:39.197 --> 20:40.407
Carl.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.117
Hmm.

20:42.993 --> 20:44.828
You ain't doing much of anything.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.039
Carl Lucas.

20:47.831 --> 20:51.001
[laughing] That's a square-ass name, man.

20:51.084 --> 20:55.422
Oh, if my mama named me that,
I'd change my name to Luke Cage, too.

20:55.505 --> 20:56.757
[chuckles]

21:00.343 --> 21:01.428
See...

21:03.055 --> 21:05.390
I don't know shit about going to prison.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.601
But I figure if you escaped,

21:08.685 --> 21:11.188
faked your death,
and all that other slick shit,

21:11.271 --> 21:13.315
eventually it's bound
to catch up with you.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.359
And you gotta go back.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.238
You're not turning me in.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.241
You wouldn't snitch.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.451
Well...

21:25.535 --> 21:27.955
there is honor amongst thieves.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.584
But you ain't no thief.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.046
Gave a speech at a church,

21:36.129 --> 21:39.382
knocked down a few doors
in the projects and now...

21:39.466 --> 21:42.010
you Harlem's Captain America.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.429
Nigga, please.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.640
How they gonna feel
about their folk hero

21:47.724 --> 21:51.019
when they find out he ain't nothing more
than a goddamn criminal?

21:52.395 --> 21:55.107
And you act like you better than me.

21:58.193 --> 21:59.527
You ain't better than me.

22:03.949 --> 22:05.283
You got caught.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.661
I was framed. I'm innocent.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.539
[chuckles] Aren't we all?

22:11.623 --> 22:13.917
[laughing]

22:14.001 --> 22:15.252
Hmm.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.882
I'mma keep your little secret.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.386
I've got use for bulletproof niggas.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.806
I own you now.

22:28.891 --> 22:33.145
And if you refuse...
then back to Seagate you go.

22:33.937 --> 22:37.065
I'll charter the yacht my damn self.

22:39.234 --> 22:43.906
See, you thought I only had
a hand in one of the pies.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.992
But I own the whole goddamn bakery, son.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.505
[Stokes laughing]

23:24.529 --> 23:26.573
Do you remember me...

23:27.282 --> 23:28.616
from when I was a kid?

23:29.534 --> 23:30.535
No.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.789
Are you one of those that used to
follow Cornell around like a puppy?

23:34.872 --> 23:35.915
Hmm.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.793
I didn't have shit.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.338
I grew up in the street.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.592
But the one name that always rang out...

23:46.676 --> 23:47.970
was "Stokes."

23:49.221 --> 23:50.930
You needed a Thanksgiving turkey?

23:51.598 --> 23:54.101
Go see Mama Mabel Stokes.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.393
School clothes?

23:56.311 --> 23:58.063
Mama Mabel Stokes.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.483
Your old man put his hands on you?

24:01.566 --> 24:03.776
See Mama Mabel Stokes...

24:05.070 --> 24:08.073
and it would never, ever happen again.

24:08.156 --> 24:10.908
- Your point?
- Your family name meant something.

24:10.993 --> 24:14.829
Harlem's Paradise meant something.

24:14.912 --> 24:19.751
Everyone from David Dinkins to Pappy Mason
showed that woman love.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.130
But what does that family represent now?

24:25.090 --> 24:27.259
A washed-up gangsterland?

24:27.342 --> 24:32.305
An empty politician who'll be lucky...

24:33.223 --> 24:35.100
at this time next year...

24:36.226 --> 24:38.603
to be a greeter at the Harlem Hair Expo?

24:39.854 --> 24:41.106
You don't talk to me like that.

24:41.189 --> 24:44.067
I can talk to you any way I want.

24:44.151 --> 24:48.363
Because you got no power to shut me up.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.157
Do you like how it feels?

24:52.325 --> 24:53.618
Being so powerless?

24:53.701 --> 24:56.704
Being pushed around by other people?

25:00.292 --> 25:02.044
What do you think?

25:02.627 --> 25:03.920
I think...

25:05.797 --> 25:07.340
that when you get the nerve...

25:09.926 --> 25:11.469
you're gonna be surprised...

25:12.387 --> 25:14.013
at just what you're capable of.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.789
[Claire] So that's how
you're gonna play this? You're running?

25:41.749 --> 25:43.210
There's nothing I can do.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.003
Enough with this defeatist bullshit.

25:46.088 --> 25:47.589
What the hell is going on?

25:48.840 --> 25:51.259
Cottonmouth knows about my past, Claire.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.846
If I don't work for him,
he's gonna out me.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.224
I'll go back to prison.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.728
I've been through too much hell
to let that happen.

26:01.811 --> 26:05.022
Yeah, I... I sympathize. I really do.

26:05.107 --> 26:06.816
But if you run...

26:06.899 --> 26:08.985
you'll be running
for the rest of your life.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.530
You think you're the first person
to tell me that?

26:12.614 --> 26:14.991
I told Pop I was done running.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.369
I stayed and he died.

26:17.452 --> 26:21.581
I didn't run when they came after Connie,
and they lost everything because of me.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.832
Who's next?

26:23.333 --> 26:24.751
I'm no good for anyone.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.255
You can't take the blame
for everything that happened.

26:29.297 --> 26:30.507
People need you.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.551
Yeah, well,
sometimes I'm no good for people.

26:33.635 --> 26:37.264
If people see that you're one of them,
that's good.

26:37.347 --> 26:39.974
If you stand and fight,
they'll follow you.

26:40.057 --> 26:43.019
If I go to prison,
who's gonna wanna follow me?

26:43.102 --> 26:48.983
Half the people uptown have fathers,
cousins, uncles, brothers in prison.

26:49.066 --> 26:51.569
You're no different than anybody else.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.447
You get your wish. You're not special.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.410
Instead of running, if you make a move

26:58.493 --> 27:01.120
and you take him down once and for all?

27:01.204 --> 27:03.331
You stop him, you save this community,

27:03.415 --> 27:05.124
and you free yourself.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.877
Or...

27:16.886 --> 27:17.970
[hip-hop music playing]

27:18.054 --> 27:19.597
[Stokes] Turn up the bass.

27:31.025 --> 27:33.110
I ain't one to apologize.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.197
Then don't.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.366
But I was feeling myself a little earlier.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.826
My bad.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.745
I ain't mean to come at you like that.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.334
You're under a lot of stress.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.086
It's that nigga, Luke Cage.

27:51.504 --> 27:52.922
I invited him over.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.132
Had to let him know.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.136
What'd you do?

28:00.054 --> 28:01.556
I gave him the business.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.933
All that Seagate shit you told me about.

28:05.643 --> 28:06.644
What?

28:06.728 --> 28:10.732
Diamondback didn't want you to do that.
He's got plans for him.

28:10.815 --> 28:13.360
Well, Diamondback ain't my daddy.

28:13.443 --> 28:14.736
What's he know about Cage?

28:14.819 --> 28:17.572
Did you spook him? Is he gonna run?

28:17.655 --> 28:19.741
He will fall in line.

28:22.327 --> 28:23.536
No doubt.

28:28.333 --> 28:32.795
[winces] Sometimes pain is the only thing
that gets 'em going.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.798
They can't do that to their wife
so they take it out on you.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.927
Where the hell have you been?

28:40.011 --> 28:41.888
We needed you an hour ago.

28:41.971 --> 28:46.226
Look at what happened.
Sister Boy didn't have any protection.

28:46.934 --> 28:50.522
At least the bastard had enough sense
not to hit him in the face.

28:50.605 --> 28:53.691
Maybe Sister needs to learn
how to throw her hands up like a brother.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.610
[breathing heavily]

28:55.693 --> 28:58.154
While you out there in the street
running around with your friends,

28:58.238 --> 29:00.365
my people in here getting hurt.

29:00.448 --> 29:03.410
You better have a damn good reason
for not being here when I needed you.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.537
Pete took me to an audition.

29:05.620 --> 29:08.790
You expect me to believe
that an audition took six hours?

29:09.666 --> 29:11.125
He stopped in Spanish Harlem.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.921
Puerto Ricans?

29:15.004 --> 29:20.092
Like that... Tato Lopez and Sal...

29:20.176 --> 29:23.305
I heard Salvador.
That's who Pete talked to.

29:23.388 --> 29:24.639
Where were you?

29:24.722 --> 29:28.768
[sighs] I kicked it
with Salvador's little brother, Domingo.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.603
We watched <i>Video Music Box.</i>

29:30.687 --> 29:32.021
What'd they talk about?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.648
They were in the back room.

29:34.566 --> 29:36.150
They were gone for a while.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.322
You done good.

29:44.326 --> 29:46.453
[sighs] You done good.

29:47.620 --> 29:51.458
Hey. HD, Blu-ray,
I got all the best angles of the incident.

29:51.541 --> 29:53.960
I got everybody in here.
You know you want to see it.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.588
- People actually pay money for that?
- Yo.

29:56.671 --> 29:59.674
- Yo. It's you! You one of them!
- No.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.801
Come on, let's talk. My man's got a RED,

30:01.884 --> 30:04.387
next time you do something,
I could film you.

30:04.471 --> 30:05.680
We could both get paid.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.849
For real. 4K for four K,
you know what I'm sayin'?

30:07.932 --> 30:09.309
Hey, hey. I know you hear things.

30:12.479 --> 30:14.897
Look, I hear and see everything.

30:14.981 --> 30:18.234
The streets know what you've been up to.
Everyone's talking about it.

30:18.318 --> 30:20.027
But I ain't no snitch.

30:20.111 --> 30:21.779
Not everyone deserves discretion.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.781
I'm not asking you to get involved.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.575
I'm not even asking you to speak.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.328
I just need to borrow your eyes.

30:30.622 --> 30:31.748
All right.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.376
Who you looking for?

30:36.085 --> 30:37.712
Domingo Colon.

30:37.795 --> 30:39.255
[speaking Spanish]

30:41.383 --> 30:42.425
[groans]

30:47.138 --> 30:48.431
[Luke] Domingo Colon!

30:50.683 --> 30:52.268
I'm guessing that's you.

30:53.811 --> 30:55.647
- [man grunting]
- [Luke grunting]

31:05.532 --> 31:07.033
- [man groans]
- [guns cocking]

31:07.992 --> 31:10.453
I guess you guys
haven't heard about me, have you?

31:10.537 --> 31:12.539
- Take him out.
- [guns firing]

31:12.622 --> 31:13.831
[bullets ricocheting]

31:27.178 --> 31:29.972
I'm about sick
of always having to buy new clothes.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.061
[man screams]

31:44.028 --> 31:45.738
[Luke] Where are the guns?

31:45.822 --> 31:47.198
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:47.281 --> 31:49.742
The ones you got back from Cottonmouth.

31:49.826 --> 31:51.327
The ones my friends died over.

31:52.412 --> 31:54.330
What, you think you can go after everyone?

31:54.956 --> 31:55.957
I kinda do.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.462
I can pick you up...

32:00.545 --> 32:02.589
walk you over to the bridge...

32:03.506 --> 32:05.382
and throw your ass in the Hudson.

32:08.260 --> 32:12.389
And here's the thing.
It's not the fall that kills you.

32:12.474 --> 32:14.517
It's the impact against the water.

32:14.601 --> 32:18.480
And when the water fills your lungs,
right before you black out,

32:18.563 --> 32:20.022
you'll ask yourself...

32:21.065 --> 32:23.818
"Why didn't I just give Luke Cage
what he wanted?"

32:25.570 --> 32:27.196
The guns are downstairs.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.159
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

32:46.633 --> 32:48.551
You got this one in a double XL?

32:49.426 --> 32:51.137
You'll like this.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.017
I already know what he looks like, Bailey.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.685
But aside from your board...

32:58.603 --> 33:01.856
this is the only photo of him. Anywhere.

33:01.939 --> 33:04.358
- Nothing else?
- Nope.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.529
Why do you seem so excited by that?

33:07.612 --> 33:11.323
[chuckles] 'Cause he is too damn clean.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.118
You know, he's so clean, it's...
it's freaky.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.286
In what way?

33:15.953 --> 33:18.623
He has, uh, no credit cards.
No email address.

33:18.706 --> 33:21.000
But he has a social security number.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.796
Yeah, but no bank account.
No Facebook. No porn.

33:24.879 --> 33:27.464
Why do you find no porn so disturbing?

33:27.549 --> 33:29.050
[scoffs]

33:29.133 --> 33:31.803
This guy, he doesn't exist.

33:31.886 --> 33:33.638
He was created.

33:33.721 --> 33:35.932
He's the figment
of someone's imagination.

33:36.015 --> 33:39.393
Who the hell is this guy?
And... and who made him?

33:39.476 --> 33:41.813
Yeah. Who you telling?

33:42.772 --> 33:44.816
But he's innocent.

33:44.899 --> 33:46.693
- I give you my word.
- [woman on phone] <i>That may be.</i>

33:46.776 --> 33:48.736
<i>But all this tension</i>
<i>is hurting the council</i>

33:48.820 --> 33:50.780
<i>- and it's harming the party.</i>
- Yeah.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.033
When will you make the announcement?

33:54.116 --> 33:57.453
<i>Charlene will send a press release</i>
<i>at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.</i>

33:57.537 --> 34:01.082
<i>I'm going to have to ask you to resign,</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

34:01.165 --> 34:02.542
I hear you.

34:05.920 --> 34:10.800
You realize that I will fight this
with every ounce of my energy, right?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.051
Right?

34:12.134 --> 34:14.511
<i>It's painful for all of us,</i>
<i>but it's necessary.</i>

34:14.596 --> 34:15.638
<i>We have no other choice.</i>

34:15.722 --> 34:17.056
- Okay.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

34:18.264 --> 34:19.516
[glass shatters]

34:19.601 --> 34:21.476
[breathing heavily]

34:25.732 --> 34:27.567
[gasps]

34:36.868 --> 34:38.244
[sniffles]

34:42.498 --> 34:44.416
- Tony.
- [Tony on speakerphone] <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

34:44.500 --> 34:46.628
- Bring the car around.
<i>- Right away.</i>

34:49.463 --> 34:51.422
[sniffles and exhales]

34:51.507 --> 34:53.550
[Stokes playing keyboard]

35:44.018 --> 35:45.728
On his deathbed...

35:47.229 --> 35:49.231
what did you promise Buggy?

35:53.319 --> 35:57.699
That you'd take care of me and...
our business.

35:58.825 --> 36:01.035
What the hell
are you talking about, Mabel?

36:02.036 --> 36:04.538
I've always put this shit
before anything else.

36:08.876 --> 36:12.004
You were my woman before you was his.

36:12.088 --> 36:13.715
But I let that go.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.843
You always protect your family.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.054
No matter what.

36:20.137 --> 36:22.098
So you betrayed me?

36:23.891 --> 36:25.642
To some goddamn Puerto Ricans?

36:25.727 --> 36:26.978
This... [grunts]

36:31.398 --> 36:35.236
This shit... should have been mine.

36:36.863 --> 36:38.865
And you know it.

36:40.491 --> 36:41.658
[sighs]

36:42.785 --> 36:44.829
Now, Salvador and his brothers

36:44.912 --> 36:47.498
have agreed to let us come in
on the ground floor.

36:49.125 --> 36:51.252
We can own this whole goddamn city.

36:51.377 --> 36:54.756
I already have everything I need.

36:57.008 --> 36:59.093
Pigs get fat...

37:00.928 --> 37:02.221
but hogs...

37:03.597 --> 37:05.099
get slaughtered.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.772
This was all about you.

37:13.482 --> 37:15.109
You know what?

37:15.192 --> 37:17.694
You always stay ready with a plan, bitch.

37:19.739 --> 37:21.657
[smacks lips] So what is it?

37:32.209 --> 37:33.961
[breath shuddering]

37:34.879 --> 37:36.505
[gun cocks]

37:47.767 --> 37:49.726
You don't have to do this, Cornell.

37:51.896 --> 37:53.856
And all that talent you have?

38:02.489 --> 38:04.033
What are you doing?

38:06.410 --> 38:08.120
You're not built for this.

38:09.413 --> 38:12.458
Why do you think
I pay for all those lessons, man?

38:14.168 --> 38:16.838
You can be something
better than all of us.

38:19.423 --> 38:22.759
You deserve this
for what you did to our family.

38:23.677 --> 38:25.512
What you did to me!

38:26.263 --> 38:27.723
Hey, Little May, don't...

38:28.599 --> 38:30.893
What are you talking about?
[stutters] You laughed with me.

38:30.977 --> 38:33.187
It was... it was a game.
[chuckles nervously]

38:33.270 --> 38:34.396
Cornell.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.192
I told you what to do.

38:40.111 --> 38:41.988
Stand up straight.

38:44.115 --> 38:45.449
And do it.

38:46.617 --> 38:48.452
- [gun cocks]
- [Uncle Pete] Look at me.

38:50.412 --> 38:51.998
[shouts] Look at me!

38:54.917 --> 38:55.918
- Every time...
- [gun firing]

39:10.057 --> 39:13.936
You know the rule, baby. Family first.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.188
Always.

39:18.941 --> 39:20.817
Yes, ma'am.

39:30.786 --> 39:32.413
You could have called first.

39:32.496 --> 39:35.082
Oh, now I need an invite.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.962
Can't imagine the kind of pressure
you're under.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.008
Especially after that shit-show
of an interview.

39:44.091 --> 39:46.843
You need to drop this Luke Cage shit.

39:46.928 --> 39:49.680
Shut it down.
Get your head back in the game.

39:49.763 --> 39:52.474
Don't lecture me about the game.
I was born to this shit.

39:54.226 --> 39:56.312
I finally got his bitch-ass in my pocket.

39:57.063 --> 39:59.190
My party chairwoman called me tonight

39:59.273 --> 40:01.483
to tell me I had to step down
from the council.

40:02.568 --> 40:06.655
The fundraising for my complexes dried up
since you got arrested.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.950
My reputation is in the shithole!

40:09.033 --> 40:11.660
Maybe Madam Councilwoman
need to step off her high horse

40:11.743 --> 40:12.869
and get her hands dirty.

40:12.954 --> 40:14.705
We family, Cornell.

40:14.788 --> 40:17.166
- Mama Mabel taught us that...
- Mama Mabel, Mama Mabel!

40:17.249 --> 40:18.500
Go on with that shit.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.965
All the things
I could've did with my life...

40:25.132 --> 40:26.425
my music...

40:27.843 --> 40:32.223
But who does she send
to that uppity-ass boarding school? You.

40:33.224 --> 40:35.767
She put you in school
and forced me to run the streets.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.394
You idiot.

40:37.478 --> 40:41.023
She sent me away
to keep me away from Pete!

40:41.857 --> 40:44.526
You know damn well
what that woman made me do.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.113
I was 14 years old.

40:47.196 --> 40:48.948
Uncle Pete betrayed us.

40:49.031 --> 40:52.076
Uncle Pete was the only one
who ever had my back.

40:53.869 --> 40:58.290
Mama Mabel was always
sheltering you, protecting you.

40:58.374 --> 40:59.375
And for what?

40:59.959 --> 41:02.836
All that education,
and you just as shady as me.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.047
Me protected?

41:05.131 --> 41:09.926
All I did your whole life was protect you!

41:10.011 --> 41:14.056
Your junkie mama dropped you off
at Mabel's and never looked back!

41:14.140 --> 41:15.849
Your daddy didn't want you!

41:15.932 --> 41:20.104
Who was there changing your diapers?
Tending your needs?

41:20.187 --> 41:21.522
Dealing with your whining?

41:21.605 --> 41:25.026
I saw the way you used to flirt
with Uncle Pete when I was little.

41:26.193 --> 41:27.194
[laughs]

41:28.195 --> 41:31.198
Running around half-naked all the time.

41:31.282 --> 41:32.992
You wanted it, Mariah.

41:33.867 --> 41:35.661
You wanted it and you know it.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.831
[Mariah screams] No!

41:39.915 --> 41:42.418
[screaming] No!

41:45.712 --> 41:49.466
- I did not want it!
- [groaning]

41:49.550 --> 41:50.551
No!

41:52.261 --> 41:53.762
You shut up!

41:53.845 --> 41:57.933
- No, I didn't want it!
- [breathing heavily]

42:00.977 --> 42:02.188
[grunting]

42:04.523 --> 42:05.982
[bones crunching]

42:06.067 --> 42:08.360
I didn't want it!

42:11.655 --> 42:13.074
[gasps]

42:15.326 --> 42:17.203
[Shades] Look at you.

42:25.211 --> 42:26.503
You got the nerve...

42:30.924 --> 42:31.967
and you stepped up.

42:32.051 --> 42:34.470
I didn't... I didn't want this.

42:35.471 --> 42:36.555
[Shades sighs]

42:36.638 --> 42:37.848
[Mariah shudders]

42:38.557 --> 42:39.891
Deep down...

42:43.145 --> 42:44.313
[whispers] I think you did.

42:47.691 --> 42:48.900
First time...

42:51.070 --> 42:52.321
is always the hardest.

43:00.621 --> 43:02.206
Do you think...

43:02.873 --> 43:04.583
they have rubber gloves in the kitchen?

43:06.627 --> 43:09.004
Next to the dishwashing station.

43:10.422 --> 43:13.092
[chuckles] That's a great idea.

43:17.804 --> 43:20.807
Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.

43:31.985 --> 43:33.445
[Misty] Nice sweatshirt.

43:33.529 --> 43:35.071
You box now?

43:36.323 --> 43:38.367
What I do is more like CrossFit.

43:39.910 --> 43:42.288
Always full of surprises.

43:44.831 --> 43:46.500
And I hate that.

43:46.583 --> 43:48.877
I don't know shit about you.

43:50.171 --> 43:53.299
Nobody does. And that's the problem.

43:54.841 --> 43:59.930
But out of all the people in the world,
Scarfe went to you for protection.

44:00.013 --> 44:03.142
- Why?
- You'd have to ask him that.

44:03.225 --> 44:06.187
How convenient for you that I can't.

44:07.062 --> 44:09.105
Look, you texted me. What do you want?

44:10.023 --> 44:11.983
You see that van parked over there?

44:12.776 --> 44:14.069
I bet if you looked inside,

44:14.153 --> 44:16.905
it's filled with all of those
Justin Hammer guns from the heist.

44:16.988 --> 44:20.576
You think being a vigilante
makes this all right?

44:20.659 --> 44:24.413
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you've caused?

44:24.496 --> 44:27.123
Misty, I know what you're going through.

44:27.208 --> 44:28.292
[scoffs]

44:28.375 --> 44:32.045
Finding out your partner was corrupt,
losing him...

44:32.128 --> 44:34.590
- It's messin' with your head...
- Do not talk to me

44:34.673 --> 44:36.925
[voice breaking]
like you know what I'm going through.

44:38.177 --> 44:40.554
I'm gonna take care of Cottonmouth.

44:40.637 --> 44:43.056
You need to be ready
to move on him when I do.

44:45.267 --> 44:48.562
What's your big plan? Huh?

44:48.645 --> 44:50.439
You gonna take over Harlem?

44:50.522 --> 44:52.358
- I don't want Harlem.
- Then what do you want?

44:52.441 --> 44:53.442
To be left alone.

44:53.525 --> 44:55.319
If that's what you truly want...

44:56.445 --> 44:59.990
then you will give me
all the information you have right now.

45:00.073 --> 45:01.157
On the record.

45:01.242 --> 45:04.661
Tell me everything you have and end it.
Right here.

45:04.745 --> 45:06.037
I'm not going to do that, Misty.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.333
- Then that makes you an accessory.
- To what?

45:09.416 --> 45:12.085
After what happened this morning,
you expect me to trust the system?

45:12.168 --> 45:15.464
- The system is not your enemy.
- Really?

45:16.465 --> 45:18.259
How's the system
been treating you lately?

45:19.050 --> 45:20.677
I should kill Cottonmouth.

45:21.970 --> 45:23.221
But I won't.

45:24.097 --> 45:26.057
I want him to suffer.

45:27.601 --> 45:29.728
He should know what it feels like
when your life is over,

45:29.811 --> 45:32.981
while everyone else's life goes on
as if you don't exist.

45:33.064 --> 45:36.277
You sound like you're speaking
from experience.

45:37.403 --> 45:39.070
You should trust me, Misty.

45:39.988 --> 45:41.114
Like Pop did.

45:42.240 --> 45:46.287
If you gave me one good reason why...
[scoffs]

45:46.370 --> 45:47.538
I would.

46:01.176 --> 46:02.969
Anonymous tip?

46:04.763 --> 46:07.140
Every cop needs a good snitch.

46:09.310 --> 46:11.144
You're not out of the doghouse.

46:12.313 --> 46:13.980
Not by a long shot.

46:22.739 --> 46:24.908
- [sighs]
- [phone ringing]

46:31.206 --> 46:32.499
Detective Knight.

46:35.419 --> 46:36.587
What?

46:38.296 --> 46:40.173
Oh, shit!

46:41.007 --> 46:43.427
[Claire] Okay, so I'm just trying
to picture it in my head.

46:44.345 --> 46:46.763
Was it mustard yellow? Or canary yellow?

46:47.889 --> 46:50.183
[Luke chuckles] It was all I could grab.

46:50.934 --> 46:53.395
I couldn't go running around Georgia
looking like a runaway slave.

46:53.479 --> 46:54.771
[Claire clicks tongue]

46:54.855 --> 46:57.190
[laughing] Oh, God.

46:58.108 --> 47:00.110
What did your father say
when he saw you?

47:02.738 --> 47:03.739
Nothing.

47:05.741 --> 47:07.493
He doesn't know I'm alive.

47:10.704 --> 47:12.330
He wouldn't want to see me anyway.

47:13.248 --> 47:14.583
I'm his...

47:15.751 --> 47:17.002
shame.

47:20.506 --> 47:23.675
The last thing my father wanted to do
was to raise a black criminal.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.637
He did everything in his power
to give me the kind of life

47:26.720 --> 47:28.263
so that wouldn't happen.

47:29.305 --> 47:30.474
And yet...

47:31.392 --> 47:32.809
I still went to jail.

47:34.019 --> 47:36.062
That wasn't your fault.

47:36.146 --> 47:38.106
He didn't see it that way.

47:38.732 --> 47:40.734
I tried to explain.

47:40.817 --> 47:43.987
I made calls. I sent letters...

47:44.070 --> 47:46.072
and he returned every last one of them.

47:46.156 --> 47:50.577
Then why let your father's last memory
of you be as a criminal?

47:50.661 --> 47:52.287
A dead criminal.

47:52.788 --> 47:55.331
I think he'd be very proud
to know who you are now.

47:59.335 --> 48:00.629
Anyway, thank you.

48:01.588 --> 48:02.589
For what?

48:03.339 --> 48:07.719
I can't imagine there are that many people
who know the saga of Luke Cage.

48:08.804 --> 48:10.556
It means a lot that you trust me.

48:11.682 --> 48:15.060
I didn't come to Harlem
to be a hero, Claire.

48:15.143 --> 48:17.270
I came because I needed time
to figure shit out.

48:17.353 --> 48:18.522
So did I.

48:20.441 --> 48:21.733
You're right.

48:22.651 --> 48:23.944
I can't keep running.

48:26.112 --> 48:28.156
But I want you to know
what you're getting into.

48:29.866 --> 48:31.618
If Cottonmouth talks,

48:31.702 --> 48:36.122
or if anybody connects the dots
that Luke Cage is Carl Lucas...

48:36.206 --> 48:37.666
I go back to Seagate.

48:37.749 --> 48:40.293
You knew the risks
and you did it anyway.

48:40.376 --> 48:42.253
That's what makes you a hero.

48:44.005 --> 48:45.674
Maybe I should get a mask after all.

48:46.382 --> 48:47.551
[groaning] No.

48:49.385 --> 48:52.055
Too much in Harlem
happens in the shadows.

48:53.474 --> 48:55.851
People fear what they can't see.

48:55.934 --> 48:58.770
And that's what makes you different.
They see you.

48:59.980 --> 49:01.732
It makes them trust you.

49:11.992 --> 49:13.785
Hey, Carl.

49:13.869 --> 49:16.329
One Judas for another.

49:19.290 --> 49:23.378
I may have a lawyer friend who can help.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.880
Oh, really?

49:27.549 --> 49:28.592
[gunshot]

49:33.722 --> 49:34.765
Luke?

49:42.355 --> 49:44.816
- Luke?
- [groans]

49:44.900 --> 49:46.359
- [gunshot]
- Luke?

49:46.442 --> 49:47.528
[Luke groans]

49:53.158 --> 49:55.827
[yelling]
