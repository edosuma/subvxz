WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:02.209
Previously on...

00:02.233 --> 00:04.056
If you try to come
between me and my husband,

00:04.080 --> 00:06.083
I will take you down.
Bring it on.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.614
Gabrielle threatened a nun...

00:07.638 --> 00:10.987
You're good to go.
Susan hit on her doctor...

00:11.011 --> 00:14.125
So you came to ask me out?
'Cause I'll say yes.

00:14.149 --> 00:17.264
And Bree's daughter
let her intentions be known.

00:18.649 --> 00:21.998
It's amazing how far
we're willing to go.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.309
Andrew, give me one good reason why I shouldn't
call the police. Because I'm your son.

00:25.333 --> 00:28.256
All in the name of love.

00:30.301 --> 00:33.640
If there was one thing
Edie britt understood,

00:33.664 --> 00:37.044
it was the nature of war.

00:37.068 --> 00:41.748
After two failed marriages
and countless rocky romances,

00:41.772 --> 00:45.021
she had learned
that love was a battlefield,

00:45.045 --> 00:48.024
and the easiest way
to survive the carnage

00:48.048 --> 00:51.158
was total surrender.

00:51.182 --> 00:53.160
You know, I was thinking,

00:53.184 --> 00:56.403
a vacation to Rome
would be so romantic.

00:56.427 --> 00:59.406
Vegas is cheaper.

00:59.430 --> 01:02.109
Oh.

01:02.133 --> 01:05.172
Could you put
your underwearinthe hamper?

01:05.196 --> 01:09.566
Can you do it?
You're standing right there.

01:10.801 --> 01:15.422
I've got a hankering
for Chinese food tonight.

01:15.446 --> 01:17.424
No, I'm so over rice.

01:17.448 --> 01:21.057
Let's do pizza.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.161
But the day comes
for every solider

01:24.185 --> 01:26.062
when she must take a stand...

01:26.086 --> 01:28.095
What do you think you're doing?

01:28.119 --> 01:30.137
And fight.

01:30.161 --> 01:33.270
It's time for my game.
I wanna watch my movie.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.471
Edie...

01:34.495 --> 01:37.474
This is important to me.

01:37.498 --> 01:42.468
Fine. I have stuff to do anyway.

01:43.774 --> 01:46.613
You see, when it came to men,

01:46.637 --> 01:49.356
Edie had a battle plan

01:49.380 --> 01:51.640
all her own.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.322
Ahem.

01:55.346 --> 01:58.716
You got five minutes for Edie?

02:01.252 --> 02:06.133
Wow. That's some knot you tied.

02:06.157 --> 02:07.104
Yeah?

02:07.128 --> 02:10.276
Well, it's no fun
if it's not tight.

02:11.602 --> 02:14.441
You know what would
be hot? Mnh-mnh.

02:14.465 --> 02:15.812
Whipped cream.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.147
Oh, you are so bad.

02:20.171 --> 02:22.411
Oh, you have no idea.

02:27.748 --> 02:32.478
Yes, Edie britt understood
the nature of war.

02:34.285 --> 02:38.535
Edie, it's been ten minutes!
Where's the damn whipped cream?

02:38.559 --> 02:41.889
She also knew
that to the Victor...

02:43.394 --> 02:46.243
Edie! Edie!

02:46.267 --> 02:54.267
Go the spoils.

02:54.745 --> 02:57.484
The guest bedroom
on the second floor

02:57.508 --> 02:59.786
of the applewhite house
had the best view

02:59.810 --> 03:01.788
in all of Wisteria Lane.

03:01.812 --> 03:05.732
From its windows one could see
from Mike Delfino's house

03:05.756 --> 03:07.564
on one end of the street

03:07.588 --> 03:11.438
all the way to the old
Huber place on the other.

03:11.462 --> 03:14.649
But, unfortunately,
for the room's newest guest,

03:14.673 --> 03:17.404
the view was about to change...

03:17.428 --> 03:19.328
Dramatically.

03:28.839 --> 03:30.757
What on earth is he doing out?

03:30.781 --> 03:32.359
Caleb, go up to your room.

03:32.383 --> 03:35.222
Mom and I gotta have a talk now.

03:35.246 --> 03:37.224
His room?
Have you lost your mind?

03:37.248 --> 03:39.226
Relax, I've taped newspapers
to the windows.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.197
People can't see in. Caleb,
get back down here.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.230
No, no, we had a talk.
It's fine.

03:43.254 --> 03:44.509
He understands
what's gonna happen

03:44.533 --> 03:46.533
if he's discovered. For five
seconds he understands it,

03:46.557 --> 03:48.235
and then he forgets.
You know that.

03:48.259 --> 03:50.607
We can protect him without
treating him like an animal.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.379
I am keeping him safe

03:52.403 --> 03:55.842
from the police,
from the fosters, from himself.

03:55.866 --> 03:57.614
He is not going back downstairs!

03:57.638 --> 04:01.388
Since when do you
talk to me like that?

04:01.412 --> 04:04.722
Since I share in the risk.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.799
I have a few announcements.

04:12.823 --> 04:15.462
I'd like to acknowledge
Mrs. Herbert

04:15.486 --> 04:17.803
for spearheading
the potluck dinner.

04:17.827 --> 04:20.666
Her hard work and tuna melt led
to the best turnout in months.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.739
She's adorable, isn't she?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.671
She's okay.

04:24.695 --> 04:26.673
Next Saturday
the women's ministry...

04:26.697 --> 04:29.346
Ours will be gorgeous.
Knock it off.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.247
Knock what off?
Babies, babies, babies.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.619
You sound like a broken record.

04:32.643 --> 04:35.627
I just had a miscarriage.
It's gonna take some time

04:35.651 --> 04:37.354
before I'm ready
to get pregnant again.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.626
Any idea when you'll be ready?
You know, ballpark?

04:39.650 --> 04:44.291
Stop it. Let's just enjoy
the here and now.

04:44.315 --> 04:48.435
We're together. Our marriage is
back on track. Life is good.

04:48.459 --> 04:51.338
Before we wrap up,
we have a dear friend

04:51.362 --> 04:54.749
back from her missionary trip to
tell us about her experiences...

04:54.773 --> 04:56.373
Sister Mary Bernard.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.367
Son of a bitch!

05:03.434 --> 05:06.414
Shh!

05:22.322 --> 05:25.572
Danielle?

05:25.596 --> 05:27.434
Honey, are you in there?

05:27.458 --> 05:28.905
Um, I'm doing homework.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.907
Really? Because
I'm holding your backpack

05:30.931 --> 05:32.409
with all your schoolbooks.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.103
Hold on!

05:36.336 --> 05:39.315
Thanks, mom, I was just doing
a little research online.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.317
Oh, while I'm here I might as
well grab some of your laundry.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.949
No, please, not right now.

05:42.973 --> 05:45.692
Honey, stop complaining.

05:45.716 --> 05:47.394
One day you'll wish

05:47.418 --> 05:49.818
that someone were offering
to do your laundry.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.371
Danielle, question?

06:04.395 --> 06:07.614
Is there a black man
hiding under your bed?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.051
What's going on?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.524
I just thought you should know
that I came home

06:17.548 --> 06:19.626
to find your son hiding
underneath my daughter's bed,

06:19.650 --> 06:21.357
and it just seems to me that...

06:21.381 --> 06:23.730
Inside.

06:23.754 --> 06:25.524
Right now.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.738
I apologize
for my son's behavior.

06:31.762 --> 06:34.441
It won't happen again.

06:34.465 --> 06:36.743
I put the house up for sale,
and we're moving.

06:36.767 --> 06:39.527
Now if you'll excuse me.

06:43.734 --> 06:45.712
How's it going?

06:45.736 --> 06:47.754
Oh, not good. I am trying
to salvage the pitch

06:47.778 --> 06:51.618
from the black's
frozen yogurt campaign.

06:51.642 --> 06:54.090
You know what kills me? Yeah?

06:54.114 --> 06:57.824
Here we are at "t" minus
9 hours and 11 minutes

06:57.848 --> 07:00.497
from the biggest pitch
in our company's history,

07:00.521 --> 07:06.433
and I have nothing even
vaguely presentable.

07:06.457 --> 07:09.436
I'll get the coffee.

07:09.460 --> 07:10.837
Thank you.

07:10.861 --> 07:12.839
Do you wanna...
You wanna go over it

07:12.863 --> 07:14.546
and toss some ideas around?

07:14.570 --> 07:17.043
No, that's okay.
I know you're exhausted.

07:17.067 --> 07:19.686
Youshould go to bed.

07:19.710 --> 07:22.689
Come on, honey, let's do this.
Let's nail this sucker.

07:22.713 --> 07:24.591
What do we got?

07:24.615 --> 07:27.423
We'vegot... nothing.

07:27.447 --> 07:32.799
Okay, okay.
"Black's frozen yogurt...

07:32.823 --> 07:35.737
Let your taste buds
come in from the cold."

07:35.761 --> 07:37.534
Okay, well, you know, whatever,

07:37.558 --> 07:39.706
I'm just knocking the rust off.

07:39.730 --> 07:41.107
I can do better now.
I can do better.

07:41.131 --> 07:44.941
"Black's... the fro-yo
that makes you gowhoa."

07:44.965 --> 07:46.442
Come on, I'm sorry.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.215
I just really need
to focus here.

07:49.239 --> 07:51.848
Okay! "Black's frozen yogurt...
Because our cows are better."

07:51.872 --> 07:53.950
Or no! Or... or "frogurt."

07:53.974 --> 07:55.731
"Frogurt... it's fun to eat,
fun to say."

07:55.755 --> 07:57.784
That's actually good.

07:57.808 --> 07:59.626
Really?

07:59.650 --> 08:01.788
No, the cow part...
That could work.

08:01.812 --> 08:05.091
We'll... we'll make them
into characters.

08:05.115 --> 08:07.534
We'll humanize them. Oh!

08:07.558 --> 08:08.965
I know! I know!

08:08.989 --> 08:12.499
Celebrity cow spokespeople!

08:12.523 --> 08:15.772
Yes, yes! That's exactly
what I was thinking!

08:15.796 --> 08:17.644
You know, like, make 'em,
like, into, like,

08:17.668 --> 08:19.876
famous characters, like, uh...

08:19.900 --> 08:23.500
Reverendmoo-nie. What do you...
What do you think of that?

08:25.035 --> 08:27.775
They can't all be gems.

08:31.842 --> 08:33.489
Ohh.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.792
Thank you.
I had a fabulous time.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.693
Me, too.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.567
Well, I guess
I'd better get going.

08:40.591 --> 08:42.068
Oh, um, well, uh,

08:42.092 --> 08:44.579
Julie's staying
at her father's house,

08:44.603 --> 08:46.673
and, um, I'm all alone here.

08:46.697 --> 08:48.134
Oh.

08:48.158 --> 08:49.706
Yeah.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.178
Sometimes it actually
makes me a little nervous.

08:52.202 --> 08:55.612
Turn the TV on.
That's what I do.

08:55.636 --> 08:59.045
Oh, that's a good idea.

08:59.069 --> 09:00.717
I forgot.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.919
I have a bottle of wine.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.627
It's already chilled
right in the refrigerator,

09:05.651 --> 09:08.524
and that'll just really
relax me.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.526
That's good. So, um...

09:10.550 --> 09:12.580
We're still good for Thursday?

09:15.626 --> 09:18.965
Uh, yeah, yeah,
Thursday's great.

09:18.989 --> 09:22.739
So, um...

09:22.763 --> 09:24.133
Good night.

09:25.596 --> 09:27.974
Do I just repulse you?

09:27.998 --> 09:30.717
No. Why?

09:30.741 --> 09:32.849
You know,
we've been on three dates,

09:32.873 --> 09:35.730
and you just keep acting
like a perfect gentleman,

09:35.754 --> 09:37.924
and, uh...

09:37.948 --> 09:39.926
It's getting a little old.

09:39.950 --> 09:41.888
Okay, Susan, make no mistake,
I am, like, inches away

09:41.912 --> 09:43.690
from ripping off
all your clothes right now.

09:43.714 --> 09:45.867
A-And you're stopping
yourself why?

09:45.891 --> 09:47.634
Well, I'm still your doctor,

09:47.658 --> 09:49.295
and it's not quite...
Ethical yet.

09:49.319 --> 09:52.669
Oh. So why are we dating?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.706
Look, it's only temporary.
Once you're well,

09:54.730 --> 09:56.603
and I'm done treating you,
all bets are off.

09:56.627 --> 09:59.105
Okay.

09:59.129 --> 10:00.669
Hmm.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.310
Oh, what the hell.

10:04.334 --> 10:05.784
Oh! Mmm.

10:08.679 --> 10:14.621
Okay, that sort of
felt unethical.

10:25.696 --> 10:27.834
Thank you for meeting with me.

10:27.858 --> 10:30.076
Sure. I'd have invited
you in the house,

10:30.100 --> 10:32.639
but the place is a real pigsty.

10:32.663 --> 10:35.111
Carlos, I'm a nun, not a moron.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.183
I know Gabrielle despises me.

10:37.207 --> 10:40.647
She's just jealous of you,
that's all.

10:40.671 --> 10:41.888
Of me?

10:41.912 --> 10:43.750
Well, isn't that silly?

10:43.774 --> 10:45.997
Well, she refuses
to believe that I can

10:46.021 --> 10:48.024
connect with anyone
on a spiritual level.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.256
We do have
an amazing connection.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.158
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

10:52.182 --> 10:54.160
When I saw you at church,

10:54.184 --> 10:56.694
I could tell instantly
that you were unhappy.

11:00.691 --> 11:02.638
Okay.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.640
Maybe I've been
a little down lately.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.813
Tell me.

11:06.837 --> 11:09.746
It's the whole
having kids thing again.

11:09.770 --> 11:13.279
Sister Mary, I just...
I want them so bad.

11:13.303 --> 11:15.760
But Gabrielle still
refuses to give them to you?

11:15.784 --> 11:19.686
To be fair, she did have
a miscarriage recently.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.758
What if she decides
against kids?

11:21.782 --> 11:24.791
What if this is just
a stall tactic?

11:24.815 --> 11:27.163
Then I'm screwed.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.664
Sorry. I'm sorry.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.867
Well, you're right.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.761
You're screwed.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.872
Unless...

11:35.896 --> 11:37.166
Unless what?

11:46.076 --> 11:47.876
"The American catholic's guide
to annulments."

11:49.840 --> 11:51.858
Sister Mary, what exactly
are you saying here?

11:51.882 --> 11:56.252
I'm saying god helps those
who help themselves.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.405
Hey, I got great news!

12:09.429 --> 12:11.407
We just landed the black's
frozen yogurt account!

12:11.431 --> 12:13.780
Really? They loved the pitch?

12:13.804 --> 12:16.813
The talking cows
rocked their world.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.915
Hey, how did they like
my president bull Clinton idea?

12:18.939 --> 12:23.119
Uh, well, I rewrote
some of the stuff we worked on,

12:23.143 --> 12:26.000
but, you know, essentially, it's
the same, and they ate it up.

12:26.024 --> 12:28.895
Oh, that is fantastic!

12:28.919 --> 12:30.897
Yeah, and ed said
we can finally afford

12:30.921 --> 12:32.899
to hire another executive.
Terrific!

12:32.923 --> 12:34.906
Tell me, did they like
the promotional plan

12:34.930 --> 12:37.263
sponsoring
the cow-tipping contest?

12:37.287 --> 12:39.766
Uh, well,
the pitch was running long,

12:39.790 --> 12:41.768
so we cut a few things.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.069
I'm just glad
they loved my idea.

12:43.093 --> 12:44.771
Well, to be fair...

12:44.795 --> 12:46.843
Did they like the Hugh heifer
and the playcows?

12:46.867 --> 12:49.415
They're calling me in
for a meeting.

12:49.439 --> 12:51.469
I gotta go. Love you. Bye!

12:55.005 --> 12:57.123
Yes!

12:57.147 --> 12:59.926
So this is your spleen.

12:59.950 --> 13:02.158
Normally, it would be over here.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.460
But because of your
missing ligament structure,

13:04.484 --> 13:06.401
it has wandered over there
right next to your liver.

13:06.425 --> 13:08.795
Now we discussed it
at the staff meeting.

13:08.819 --> 13:11.437
Everyone thinks you should
have it removed immediately.

13:11.461 --> 13:14.871
Oh, well, okay.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.873
I mean, I guess... I guess
you guys probably have

13:16.897 --> 13:18.875
all sorts of
new, exciting techniques

13:18.899 --> 13:20.877
where you don't even
cut open the body.

13:20.901 --> 13:24.110
No, not really. No?

13:24.134 --> 13:26.913
So...

13:26.937 --> 13:29.555
We're talking surgery?

13:29.579 --> 13:32.218
Yeah, well, I guess
I can handle that.

13:32.242 --> 13:34.220
People get cut open every day.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.131
So, um, I'm assuming you're good

13:36.155 --> 13:39.225
with me doing the surgery,
right? You?

13:39.249 --> 13:41.527
I mean, it seems natural.
I know the most about your case.

13:41.551 --> 13:43.529
I promise you'll be
in very good hands.

13:43.553 --> 13:46.873
Oh, uh, well, um...

13:46.897 --> 13:48.274
Uh...

13:48.298 --> 13:50.206
What?

13:50.230 --> 13:53.539
The first time
you'll see me naked,

13:53.563 --> 13:55.546
I'll be on an operating table.

13:55.570 --> 13:57.543
Well, I promise
I'll be a perfect gentleman.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.445
My eyes will be
strictly on the spleen.

13:59.469 --> 14:01.517
Doctor, Mrs. Baker's here
for her follow-up.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.019
Right.

14:03.043 --> 14:06.893
And we need to schedule Susan
for a splenectomy with me.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.155
Oh, congratulations!

14:09.179 --> 14:12.498
So I will call you later?

14:12.522 --> 14:15.339
Oh, I am so happy for him.
He's such a doll.

14:15.363 --> 14:18.905
I'm curious. Um...

14:18.929 --> 14:21.567
Why were you so congratulatory?

14:21.591 --> 14:23.069
Oh, the spleen surgery...

14:23.093 --> 14:24.863
It'll be his first!

14:30.500 --> 14:32.270
Hey, honey.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.182
Can we talk about something?

14:36.206 --> 14:37.423
Sure.

14:37.447 --> 14:42.028
So I've been thinking
about the whole baby thing.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.090
And how ever long it takes

14:44.114 --> 14:46.101
for you to feel ready,
I am fine with.

14:46.125 --> 14:49.235
Okay.

14:49.259 --> 14:52.038
But here's the deal...

14:52.062 --> 14:53.962
I need to know
that this isn't a maybe.

14:55.265 --> 14:59.045
I want a promise
that we will have children.

14:59.069 --> 15:01.948
I'm sorry. I can't promise that.

15:01.972 --> 15:04.951
Why not?

15:04.975 --> 15:07.513
Because I can't say
that I'm gonna wake up tomorrow

15:07.537 --> 15:10.987
and suddenly wanna do something
that I swore my entire life

15:11.011 --> 15:13.589
I would never do. "Maybe" is
a very big step for me.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.022
Yeah, well, it isn't
big enough for me.

15:16.046 --> 15:18.324
Well, I'm sorry, but you're
just gonna have to accept it.

15:18.348 --> 15:21.427
There's nothing else you can
do. That isn't necessarily true.

15:21.451 --> 15:23.651
Excuse me?

15:25.625 --> 15:29.025
You are threatening me
with an annulment?

15:30.400 --> 15:34.310
That conniving little bitch
put you up to this, didn't she?

15:34.334 --> 15:36.221
Didn't she? This fight
could be over right now

15:36.245 --> 15:38.344
if you'd just make me a promise.

15:38.368 --> 15:40.346
The only promise I am making you

15:40.370 --> 15:43.110
is that this is so not over.

15:47.077 --> 15:48.024
Hi!

15:48.048 --> 15:49.125
Hey.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.926
Hi.

15:50.950 --> 15:55.001
How's the search coming for
the new ad exec? Any luck?

15:55.025 --> 15:58.434
Oh, the pickings are slim.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.068
So far none of
my top choices are available.

16:02.092 --> 16:05.416
Hey, um, do you have someone
from your old company

16:05.440 --> 16:07.413
that you could, you know,
maybe recommend?

16:07.437 --> 16:08.944
Daddy! Well...

16:08.968 --> 16:10.416
I can't find my toothbrush.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.548
I'll be up in a second, buddy.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.742
Hi.

16:15.145 --> 16:16.622
As a matter of fact,

16:16.646 --> 16:19.385
there's this one guy who
would be perfect. Yeah?

16:19.409 --> 16:21.127
Yeah, hard-working,
smart as a whip. Total package.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.990
Really? What's his name?

16:24.014 --> 16:25.131
Tom.

16:25.155 --> 16:26.632
Tom? Tom what?

16:26.656 --> 16:28.995
Tom Scavo.

16:29.019 --> 16:30.066
Oh!

16:31.321 --> 16:32.468
No! No!

16:32.492 --> 16:35.079
I do not think that
that is a good idea.

16:35.103 --> 16:37.073
Come on, honey,

16:37.097 --> 16:39.075
I mean, the other night
doing those pitches...

16:39.099 --> 16:41.247
It just got
the old juices flowing.

16:41.271 --> 16:43.249
I remembered how much
I miss having a real job.

16:43.273 --> 16:46.482
You have a real job, right here
staying home with the kids.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.484
With two incomes, we could
afford a top-notch nanny.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.156
What about penny?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.358
You're the one who fought for
office day care. Let's use it.

16:52.382 --> 16:55.626
What about the two of us working
and living together?

16:55.650 --> 16:57.763
I think that could be
a recipe for disaster.

16:57.787 --> 17:01.547
Why? The last time
that we worked together...

17:03.453 --> 17:05.000
We fell in love.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.573
Oh, it's just...

17:07.597 --> 17:10.076
I'm...

17:10.099 --> 17:14.109
I'm not sure that you would find
this job that satisfying.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.621
You don't think
I'm good enough, do you?

17:16.645 --> 17:18.114
I'm not saying that.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.338
Daddy, I still
can't find my toothbrush!

17:22.541 --> 17:24.112
I'll go. I got it.

17:25.474 --> 17:27.792
Come on, buddy.
Let's hunt it down.

17:27.817 --> 17:29.795
So who won the fight?

17:29.819 --> 17:31.297
We weren't fighting.

17:31.321 --> 17:33.799
Mommy's just letting
daddy know where he stands.

17:33.823 --> 17:36.733
Oh, hey! Hey!

17:44.094 --> 17:46.821
Thanks for coming in,
Mr. Gainey. We'll be in touch.

17:46.845 --> 17:48.314
Thank you. Bye.

17:48.338 --> 17:51.217
What did you think? Well,
honestly, I wasn't blown away.

17:51.241 --> 17:52.718
I know the pickings are slim,

17:52.742 --> 17:54.280
but we can't hold out
much longer.

17:54.304 --> 17:55.791
We need to hire
someone this week.

17:55.815 --> 17:57.523
I know! I know! I know.

17:57.547 --> 17:59.185
So who's up next?

17:59.209 --> 18:01.187
Tom cavos.
You ever heard of him?

18:01.211 --> 18:03.789
Mnh-mnh.

18:03.813 --> 18:06.223
Just... uh...

18:08.188 --> 18:10.466
Could you excuse me
for just a minute?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.120
Sure.

18:14.364 --> 18:15.847
Tom cavos?
Yeah, it's an anagram.

18:15.871 --> 18:18.644
It's deceptively simple,
don't you think?

18:18.668 --> 18:21.177
What do you think you're
doing? I'm going over your head.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.078
I mean, you might
not think I'm good enough,

18:23.102 --> 18:25.251
but maybe ed will be
a little more open-minded,

18:25.275 --> 18:27.253
since, you know, he's not
constantly competing with me.

18:27.277 --> 18:30.716
You want the truth, Tom?

18:30.740 --> 18:33.719
I think you're good.
You have moments of brilliance.

18:33.743 --> 18:36.262
But I also think
sometimes you coast.

18:36.286 --> 18:38.264
And I think if iwereyour boss

18:38.288 --> 18:40.396
and had to ride your ass
every day,

18:40.420 --> 18:43.199
you would come home
seething with resentment.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.207
Come on! It's hard enough
keeping a marriage together.

18:46.231 --> 18:48.674
If you're at all concerned
about saving our marriage,

18:48.698 --> 18:50.676
you better let me take my shot.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.608
What does that mean?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.346
It means that a little part
of me has been hating you

18:55.370 --> 18:57.283
ever since you tanked
my promotion at petersen.

18:57.307 --> 18:59.145
Tom...

18:59.169 --> 19:02.488
But I could let it all go if
you'll give me this one thing.

19:02.512 --> 19:05.591
Excuse me.
Ed's waiting for you guys.

19:05.615 --> 19:07.593
Great! Great!

19:07.617 --> 19:10.196
Just let my résumé
speak for itself.

19:10.220 --> 19:13.329
Uh, just let your résumé
speak for itself?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.500
Yes.

19:14.524 --> 19:17.333
Okay!

19:17.357 --> 19:20.206
Oh! You worked
the poncer cheese accounts?

19:20.230 --> 19:22.268
Those "angry mouse" spots?
They were hilarious!

19:22.292 --> 19:24.210
I was on that
from the beginning.

19:24.234 --> 19:25.681
Warning, do not eat the cheese!

19:25.705 --> 19:27.173
The cheese is evil!

19:27.197 --> 19:29.245
I love that!

19:29.269 --> 19:31.747
You've got a great
résumé. Thank you.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.280
Yeah, gosh, it is.
It's quite impressive.

19:34.304 --> 19:36.191
Oh, wow, I see you worked
for bellfore and barrasso.

19:36.215 --> 19:37.723
That's a great shop.

19:37.747 --> 19:40.186
Yeah, I put my time in.

19:40.210 --> 19:41.787
Uh-huh, and when were you there?
Because you forgot to list

19:41.811 --> 19:44.560
your dates of employment
for that one.

19:44.584 --> 19:47.793
Um, that was a few years back.

19:47.817 --> 19:50.496
Uh-huh. And how long
did you stay?

19:50.520 --> 19:53.799
Just about five months,
actually.

19:53.823 --> 19:55.750
What, did you get
recruited by another firm?

19:55.774 --> 19:58.344
Did somebody cherry-pick ya?

19:58.368 --> 20:00.206
No, I was fired. Oh.

20:00.230 --> 20:02.478
Yeah, but honestly,
I was happy to leave

20:02.502 --> 20:04.310
because they didn't get
my sense of humor.

20:04.334 --> 20:05.811
I actually pitched a version

20:05.835 --> 20:07.483
of the "cheese is evil"
there first. They hated it.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.885
Idiots! Well, their loss, right?

20:09.909 --> 20:11.817
Yep. And I see you won a clio

20:11.841 --> 20:13.759
for the Thompson's salad
dressing spot. That was very cool.

20:13.783 --> 20:16.822
So did you do that solo?

20:16.846 --> 20:18.824
Actually, no. My wife
helped me on that one.

20:18.848 --> 20:20.596
Um, she's in advertising, too.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.229
But if you were to ask her,
I'm sure she'd tell you

20:23.253 --> 20:25.240
she did thewholething
all by herself.

20:27.257 --> 20:29.227
Credit hog, huh?
I know the type.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.279
You know what, Tom? I like you.

20:33.303 --> 20:34.740
Ed...

20:34.764 --> 20:36.887
And I'm not usually one
for hiring in the room.

20:36.911 --> 20:38.914
No, no, no, no,
we never hire in the room.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.447
But we're in a time crunch,
and we need someone now.

20:41.471 --> 20:43.419
I think you're the guy.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.551
Lynette, you got any issues?

20:45.575 --> 20:46.722
Well...

20:46.746 --> 20:49.925
Um, let me just call in
a few references

20:49.949 --> 20:51.897
before we make
anything official.

20:51.921 --> 20:54.560
Sure! Sure!
We'll be in touch, okay?

20:54.584 --> 20:56.941
The cheese is evil!

20:56.965 --> 20:59.365
Oh, god, I love that.

20:59.389 --> 21:00.589
Ohh.

21:06.296 --> 21:08.274
Oh, um, I'm looking
for father crowley.

21:08.298 --> 21:10.276
Do you know where he is?

21:10.300 --> 21:11.740
Um, he's in the confessional.

21:14.404 --> 21:16.891
How long has it been
since your last confession?

21:16.915 --> 21:18.824
Who cares?

21:18.848 --> 21:20.326
Father, it's me.

21:20.350 --> 21:21.757
Gabrielle?

21:21.781 --> 21:22.888
Yeah.

21:22.912 --> 21:25.396
Look, I need you
to do something for me.

21:25.420 --> 21:28.394
I need you to get rid of
sister Mary Bernard.

21:28.418 --> 21:30.436
What? Why?

21:30.460 --> 21:31.967
Because she's ruining
my marriage.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.899
Sister Mary? Yes!

21:33.923 --> 21:35.641
At first it started
with the love letters

21:35.665 --> 21:37.643
while he was in prison,
and the next thing I know,

21:37.667 --> 21:39.645
they're spending
day and night together...

21:39.669 --> 21:43.048
Sneaking off
to private Bible study,

21:43.072 --> 21:45.751
and one-on-one
spiritual consultation.

21:45.775 --> 21:47.483
Gabrielle...

21:47.507 --> 21:50.386
And if that wasn't enough, he is
saying her name in his sleep.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.058
"Hold me, sister Mary, hold me."

21:53.082 --> 21:56.396
It's disgusting.
He's like a lovesick puppy.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.824
Do you have reason to believe

21:58.848 --> 22:02.297
that your husband
and sister Mary are...

22:02.321 --> 22:04.091
Having sex?

22:08.558 --> 22:10.676
Speak from the heart, Gabrielle.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.460
This is just between
me, you and god.

22:21.471 --> 22:25.020
Yeah... yep. They're having sex.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.353
Carlos confessed everything...

22:27.377 --> 22:29.877
Right before
he asked for an annulment.

22:51.841 --> 22:54.520
Forgive me,
father, for I have sinned.

22:54.544 --> 22:56.531
How long since
your last confession?

22:56.555 --> 22:59.024
Mm, not that long ago.

22:59.048 --> 23:02.488
Look, I sorta told a fib, so...

23:02.512 --> 23:06.031
How many "hail Marys"
is that gonna set me back?

23:15.495 --> 23:18.373
Oh, honey. Go away!

23:18.397 --> 23:21.106
Oh, honey, what happened
wasn't my fault.

23:21.130 --> 23:24.410
There's no way I could've
predicted how Betty would react.

23:24.434 --> 23:27.683
Oh, please, you knew
something bad would happen.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.416
You wanted all this
to blow up in my face.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.958
Oh, honey,
why would I want that?

23:32.982 --> 23:35.899
Because you're jealous that
my life's just getting started

23:35.923 --> 23:38.424
and yours is over.

23:38.448 --> 23:40.996
Danielle, that's ridiculous,
sweetheart.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.498
Daddy's dead.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.000
You drove your boyfriend
to suicide.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.977
You're getting older
by the minute,

23:47.001 --> 23:49.104
and soon you'll be
so dried up and bitter

23:49.128 --> 23:51.106
that no man will ever want
to touch you ever again.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.439
Danielle...

23:53.463 --> 23:55.586
And now you're determined
to ruin my life

23:55.610 --> 23:58.684
so I have to stay with you here
and keep you company

23:58.708 --> 24:01.046
while you turn
into an old fossil.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.819
All I ever wanted was
for you to be happy.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.483
Don't just want it.
Make it happen.

24:21.531 --> 24:24.069
Danielle, I don't feel much
like cooking tonight.

24:24.093 --> 24:26.080
I'm thinking
of ordering a pizza.

24:26.104 --> 24:28.844
I want Canadian bacon.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.045
Please.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.069
All right.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.738
He's mad at you
'cause you hit him.

24:52.762 --> 24:55.100
Well, I feel bad about that.

24:55.124 --> 24:57.611
But when I consider
the risks he was taking...

24:57.635 --> 25:00.906
It's a shame
he can't see that girl.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.630
She's so pretty.

25:04.974 --> 25:06.984
What did you say about Danielle?

25:09.679 --> 25:12.679
I said that she...

25:15.585 --> 25:18.524
You know I don't want you
thinking about things like that.

25:18.548 --> 25:21.627
I'm sorry. I didn't. I'm sorry.

25:21.651 --> 25:23.569
It's okay. It's okay.

25:23.593 --> 25:27.032
Go on and run up to your room.

25:27.056 --> 25:29.535
Read the comics I got you.

25:29.559 --> 25:32.237
And, Caleb?

25:32.261 --> 25:35.881
If I ever catch you looking
at that Van De Kamp girl,

25:35.905 --> 25:39.184
I'll hit you twice as hard
as I hit your brother,

25:39.208 --> 25:41.647
and I won't feel bad about it.

25:41.671 --> 25:42.671
Okay?

25:44.644 --> 25:45.884
Okay.

25:56.726 --> 25:59.765
So this whole
splenectomy thing...

25:59.789 --> 26:02.668
You feel good about it, huh?

26:02.692 --> 26:04.209
Yeah, yeah, I told you.
It's a routine surgery.

26:04.233 --> 26:05.771
You're gonna be fine.

26:05.795 --> 26:07.865
Right, right.

26:09.599 --> 26:13.278
Actually, I sort of meant, um...

26:13.302 --> 26:16.081
Do you personally
feel confident?

26:16.105 --> 26:18.684
What do you mean?

26:18.708 --> 26:21.208
Well, you know,
you're gonna be...

26:22.652 --> 26:24.730
Hacking into me,

26:24.754 --> 26:28.694
and I just wanted to make sure
that you feel ready.

26:28.718 --> 26:31.697
I've never taken out
a spleen before.

26:31.721 --> 26:33.699
But believe me,
it's no big deal.

26:33.723 --> 26:35.300
Spleen, gallbladder...
It's all the same.

26:35.324 --> 26:37.678
Okay, red flag! See, I didn't
go to medical school,

26:37.702 --> 26:39.675
but I'm thinking...
Not all the same.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.047
Susan, I know what I'm doing.
You're gonna have to trust me.

26:42.071 --> 26:44.780
I would like to.
But I gotta be honest...

26:44.804 --> 26:46.791
The fact that you can't even
cut that steak isn't helping.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.654
That's not fair.
You overcooked it,

26:48.678 --> 26:50.185
and, frankly,
it's not the freshest meat.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.718
Well, neither am I.
I've got 35 years on that cow.

26:52.742 --> 26:54.720
Wait, Susan, are you saying

26:54.744 --> 26:56.731
you don't want me
to be your surgeon?

26:56.755 --> 26:58.016
Uh...

26:59.789 --> 27:02.597
I'm sorry.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.600
I don't mean this to sound
the wrong way. I just...

27:05.624 --> 27:09.311
I would be more comfortable
with an experienced surgeon.

27:09.335 --> 27:12.778
That's okay. I understand.

27:12.802 --> 27:14.139
Thank you.

27:14.163 --> 27:17.643
I should really be going.

27:17.667 --> 27:19.337
What?

27:21.270 --> 27:23.248
I didn't even serve dessert yet.

27:23.272 --> 27:25.250
You said you understood! No,
I do, I do. I respect your decision

27:25.274 --> 27:27.222
to see another doctor,
but you know what?

27:27.246 --> 27:28.924
You need to respect
that my feelings are hurt.

27:28.948 --> 27:32.227
What? You want me to put
my life on the line

27:32.251 --> 27:34.259
to service your ego?

27:34.283 --> 27:37.737
I save lives every day.
I cut. I save. I cut. I save.

27:37.761 --> 27:39.634
That's what I do,
and if that gives me

27:39.658 --> 27:41.336
an out-of-control ego,
well, maybe I need that

27:41.360 --> 27:43.669
to cut into another human being.

27:43.693 --> 27:45.943
Jim...

27:53.272 --> 27:55.781
Hey. Hey.

27:55.805 --> 27:58.724
Dinner's ready. Oh.

27:58.748 --> 28:02.427
So did you call around?
Check on my references?

28:02.451 --> 28:04.860
I told ed you were my husband,

28:04.884 --> 28:06.862
and he was cool with that.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.864
He really wants to hire you.

28:08.888 --> 28:12.167
So who am I to stand in the way?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.740
Really? So I got the job?

28:14.764 --> 28:20.075
On one condition.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.778
If you take this job,

28:22.802 --> 28:25.010
you are never allowed
to bring up

28:25.034 --> 28:27.721
what happened before
with your promotion.

28:27.745 --> 28:29.084
That's it? Deal.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.817
No, it's not a deal.
I need a solemn vow

28:31.841 --> 28:35.220
that you will never throw
that in my face ever again.

28:35.244 --> 28:37.771
Because if you do,
you will unleash demons

28:37.795 --> 28:39.965
that you do not wanna meet.

28:39.989 --> 28:41.827
I get it.

28:41.851 --> 28:47.332
And whatireally need from you...

28:47.356 --> 28:50.856
Is to be forgiven.

28:53.062 --> 28:55.062
Actually, I already had.

29:12.021 --> 29:13.999
This dinner is really good.

29:14.023 --> 29:16.063
Thank you.

29:22.091 --> 29:23.491
Thank you.

29:44.814 --> 29:47.162
Hi, Betty. Hello.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.064
I wanted to talk to you
about what happened

29:49.088 --> 29:52.197
the other day with the kids. I told you,
we will be moving soon.

29:52.221 --> 29:54.199
There's nothing to worry about.

29:54.223 --> 29:57.372
Well, my fear is that
if we keep them apart,

29:57.396 --> 30:00.105
they'll try that much harder
to be together.

30:00.129 --> 30:02.107
I mean, you know
how teenagers can be,

30:02.131 --> 30:04.810
and, well, a lot can happen
in a couple of weeks.

30:04.834 --> 30:07.112
I'll make a deal with you.

30:07.136 --> 30:09.955
If you control yours,
I will control mine.

30:09.979 --> 30:14.890
Well, how about some
old-fashioned chaperoning?

30:14.914 --> 30:17.471
That way they can, um,
still see each other,

30:17.495 --> 30:20.395
and we won't have to
be the villains.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.928
When it comes
to my son's best interests,

30:22.952 --> 30:24.399
I'm not afraid of being
the villain.

30:24.423 --> 30:27.063
I assumed that you would
feel the same way, Bree.

30:29.298 --> 30:31.907
Now that you mention it,
I guess I do.

30:31.931 --> 30:35.941
I have to go. I have some,
um, muffins in the oven.

30:52.081 --> 30:53.828
Mom, what's wrong?

30:53.852 --> 30:56.436
It's the applewhites. I don't
want you to go near them. What?!

30:56.460 --> 30:58.433
Do you remember the man
they arrested...

30:58.457 --> 31:00.435
The one that broke
into Gabrielle's

31:00.459 --> 31:03.238
and escaped
from the mental hospital?

31:03.262 --> 31:04.870
He's there.

31:04.894 --> 31:07.081
I saw him in their window.
They're hiding him.

31:07.105 --> 31:09.574
You're kidding. No, I'm not.

31:09.598 --> 31:11.576
And I forbid you
to go over there.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.578
Lynette, hi, it's Bree.
Uh, listen,

31:13.602 --> 31:15.580
call me when you
get this message,

31:15.604 --> 31:17.587
and please come
to poker tonight.

31:17.611 --> 31:20.025
I have some big news
about the applewhites.

31:20.049 --> 31:23.989
All right, bye.

31:24.013 --> 31:25.490
Who was that?

31:25.514 --> 31:27.993
Sister Mary.

31:28.017 --> 31:31.536
They just transferred her to
a parish in Fairbanks, Alaska.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.538
You're kidding me. Why?

31:33.562 --> 31:34.900
She doesn't know.

31:34.924 --> 31:37.511
The diocese wouldn't even
give her a reason.

31:37.535 --> 31:41.466
Ah, Vatican politics.

31:44.373 --> 31:46.451
What's wrong?

31:46.475 --> 31:49.484
I think I'm just coming down
with a migraine.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.886
Oh, well, maybe you
should go lie down.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.888
I'm gonna be out for a while.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.120
All right.

31:55.144 --> 31:56.354
Mm-hmm.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.299
Uh, I'll see you there.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.932
Susan? What are you doing here?

32:06.956 --> 32:09.274
We need to talk. Okay,
all right, but, look,

32:09.298 --> 32:12.958
I just got out of surgery. I've
been waiting for three hours.

32:15.704 --> 32:17.687
After you stormed out
the other night,

32:17.711 --> 32:19.114
I started to doubt myself.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.986
I started to think,

32:21.010 --> 32:23.918
"gee, you know, maybe I should
just ignore my better instincts,

32:23.942 --> 32:26.992
"and I should let Dr. Ron
gut me like a fish." Susan...

32:27.016 --> 32:28.193
I mean, why not?
'Cause all my life,

32:28.217 --> 32:30.425
I have jumped through hoops
to keep men from leaving.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.058
But I'm not doing it anymore.
So tough luck, pally.

32:33.082 --> 32:36.461
You just missed out
on a good thing.

32:36.485 --> 32:37.462
Susan...

32:37.486 --> 32:39.334
You've been here
for three hours?

32:39.358 --> 32:40.966
Yeah. Well, two hours ago,

32:40.990 --> 32:43.068
flowers, champagne
and an apology note

32:43.092 --> 32:45.070
were delivered to your doorstep.

32:45.094 --> 32:46.411
Really?

32:46.435 --> 32:49.944
Look, I put our relationship
at risk, all right?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.546
And it was stupid.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.649
I haven't felt this way
about somebody

32:54.673 --> 32:56.221
in a long time.

32:56.245 --> 33:00.225
Susan, I really like you.

33:00.249 --> 33:02.557
And because of that, I...

33:02.581 --> 33:05.090
I can't be your doctor,
let alone, your surgeon.

33:05.114 --> 33:07.101
I mean,
there's a pretty good reason

33:07.125 --> 33:09.334
why they make those rules.

33:09.358 --> 33:12.397
Listen, I hope
you forgive me, all right?

33:12.421 --> 33:15.270
Because I'll hate myself
if I lose you.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.634
Wow.

33:19.028 --> 33:21.006
I wouldn't want you
to hate yourself.

33:21.030 --> 33:23.000
No.

33:27.176 --> 33:31.016
And I am so sorry
about that... snap thing.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.587
I was just trying
to be theatrical.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.681
Yeah.

33:40.389 --> 33:43.028
I got your note.
What's going on?

33:43.052 --> 33:45.470
Are you hiding
someone in your house?

33:45.494 --> 33:48.002
What?

33:48.026 --> 33:50.004
My mom saw someone in
your second-story window.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.307
She thinks it's the guy
who broke into Mrs. Solis'.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.179
Damn it, Caleb.

33:54.203 --> 33:55.540
Is that his name?

33:55.564 --> 33:57.642
Has she told anybody else?

33:57.666 --> 33:59.044
She left messages
on her friends' machines.

33:59.068 --> 34:01.146
They're coming over
soon to get details.

34:01.170 --> 34:03.118
We're gonna have to leave tonight.
This is... why? What's going on?

34:03.142 --> 34:05.250
I would love to tell you,

34:05.274 --> 34:08.092
believe me, I would.
But I can't.

34:08.117 --> 34:12.357
If you trust me,
I could help you.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.359
My family has secrets, too.

34:14.382 --> 34:16.301
What my brother did...

34:16.324 --> 34:19.364
It's bad.

34:19.388 --> 34:22.467
Last year my brother
did something really awful,

34:22.491 --> 34:24.569
and my parents
covered it up for him.

34:24.592 --> 34:26.580
If anyone were to ever find out,

34:26.603 --> 34:30.114
Andrew and my mom
could go to jail.

34:30.139 --> 34:33.078
So you don't have to worry
about me judging you.

34:33.101 --> 34:36.681
Tell me your secrets.
I'll understand.

34:43.452 --> 34:46.491
Okay.

34:46.514 --> 34:49.755
But you tell me yours first.

34:58.167 --> 35:00.805
What are you doing here?

35:00.829 --> 35:02.807
I heard you were
being transferred

35:02.831 --> 35:05.079
so I came to say good-bye.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.690
Come to gloat is more like it.

35:06.714 --> 35:09.254
No, we've had our differences,

35:09.278 --> 35:11.256
but that doesn't mean
I'm happy to see you

35:11.280 --> 35:13.087
shipped off to Alaska.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.560
Brr.

35:15.584 --> 35:18.271
You had something to do
with this, didn't you?

35:18.295 --> 35:21.296
Me? Oh, I'm just
a humble sinner.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.199
You're the one with
all the power around here...

35:24.223 --> 35:27.332
All the... annulment mojo.

35:27.356 --> 35:31.336
Is that why you did it?

35:31.360 --> 35:36.241
Well, getting rid of me
isn't gonna change anything.

35:36.265 --> 35:38.243
Carlos will do what he wants.

35:38.267 --> 35:41.146
The problems in your marriage
aren't going away.

35:41.170 --> 35:43.648
Maybe not...

35:43.672 --> 35:45.542
But you certainly are.

35:46.915 --> 35:50.175
You missed a spot.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.699
Aah!

35:54.723 --> 35:55.900
Oh!

35:55.924 --> 35:58.434
That was a mistake.

35:59.828 --> 36:01.328
Uhh!

36:03.232 --> 36:08.643
There.
I think we're all done here.

36:14.873 --> 36:17.522
Ow!

36:27.586 --> 36:30.335
Aah!

36:30.359 --> 36:32.489
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Hold on!

36:42.731 --> 36:45.710
Are you okay?

36:45.734 --> 36:47.544
Aah!

36:54.583 --> 36:56.853
Stop fighting!

36:58.847 --> 37:02.647
Stop fighting! No!

37:15.934 --> 37:17.921
What the hell were you thinking?

37:17.945 --> 37:21.616
Uh, depends.
What have you heard?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.488
I got a call from the church.

37:23.512 --> 37:25.490
They said you attacked
sister Mary.

37:25.514 --> 37:27.001
Yeah, that's about right.

37:27.025 --> 37:29.624
What are you thinking?

37:29.648 --> 37:31.696
I wasn't, but I was thinking
about it on the way over here.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.359
And I realized the ass
I should be kicking is yours.

37:34.383 --> 37:35.460
Mine? Yes!

37:35.484 --> 37:38.468
Sister Mary manipulated you
into threatening me,

37:38.492 --> 37:40.705
but you're the idiot
that fell for it.

37:40.729 --> 37:42.559
I was not threatening you.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.770
I was asking for a promise.

37:45.794 --> 37:48.381
You mademea promise, Carlos,
a long time ago...

37:48.405 --> 37:50.375
Till death do us part.

37:50.399 --> 37:52.947
And one day you just come home
and start throwing words around

37:52.971 --> 37:54.479
like annulment.

37:54.503 --> 37:56.626
How do you think
that makes me feel?

37:56.650 --> 37:58.275
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

38:05.314 --> 38:07.261
I need to have a child.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.364
And I need to know I'm the woman

38:09.388 --> 38:11.396
you want to spend
the rest of your life with,

38:11.420 --> 38:13.968
not just some uterus
in high heels.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.440
Gabrielle, please...

38:15.464 --> 38:16.947
No, Carlos, I am sorry.

38:16.971 --> 38:19.765
I am not gonna be blackmailed
into giving birth.

38:22.331 --> 38:24.679
You have to choose.

38:24.703 --> 38:29.083
And I wish you would do it
so I can move on with my life.

38:37.846 --> 38:39.846
Well, of course I choose you.

38:44.853 --> 38:46.863
I think that's
the right decision.

38:51.800 --> 38:54.930
You know,
I made a decision, too.

38:59.368 --> 39:01.846
The answer to your question
earlier is yes.

39:01.870 --> 39:03.648
Yes...

39:03.672 --> 39:06.982
I wanna have a baby.

39:11.550 --> 39:14.350
I wanna have a baby with you.

39:37.446 --> 39:38.583
Betty.

39:38.607 --> 39:40.455
What a surprise.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.087
Can I talk to you for a moment?

39:43.111 --> 39:46.391
Uh, now is actually
not a good time for me.

39:46.415 --> 39:47.892
I think it is.

39:47.916 --> 39:49.894
I wanted to chat with you

39:49.918 --> 39:52.058
before you did
something foolish.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.827
I don't know what you mean.

40:02.501 --> 40:04.749
The person you saw
at my house today

40:04.773 --> 40:06.751
is my other son.

40:06.775 --> 40:08.883
His name is Caleb.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.384
He didn't harm Gabrielle,

40:10.408 --> 40:12.386
and he didn't hurt
the man in the car trunk.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.058
That's all you need to know.

40:14.082 --> 40:15.620
He's your son?

40:15.644 --> 40:19.424
He's my dear son
who happens to be slow.

40:19.448 --> 40:21.726
Sometimes he makes mistakes.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.728
But, Betty, the police
are looking for him.

40:23.752 --> 40:27.572
He escaped from that facility
they sent him to.

40:27.596 --> 40:30.505
He had help, trust me.

40:30.529 --> 40:33.438
I've always thought
the maternal instinct

40:33.462 --> 40:36.180
is one of
nature's most amazing gifts.

40:36.204 --> 40:39.514
I mean, the length that
some mothers will go to

40:39.538 --> 40:41.816
to protect their children...

40:41.840 --> 40:44.789
It drives ordinary women
to do extraordinary things,

40:44.813 --> 40:48.753
women like me, Bree,
and like you.

40:48.777 --> 40:50.655
What are you talking about?

40:50.679 --> 40:55.460
If you breathe one word
of Caleb's existence to anyone,

40:55.484 --> 40:58.803
I will tell Carlos,
Gabrielle and the police

40:58.827 --> 41:00.805
that it was your son
driving the car

41:00.829 --> 41:02.507
that killed juanita solis

41:02.531 --> 41:05.191
and that you have been covering
up his crime ever since.

41:08.567 --> 41:12.016
We're going to be
great friends, Bree.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.579
We have so much in common.

41:14.603 --> 41:16.581
So is that all she said?

41:16.605 --> 41:19.453
Yeah, something about
the applewhites.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.955
I'm dying of curiosity.

41:24.953 --> 41:28.523
It's rude to keep
people waiting.

41:33.021 --> 41:35.099
Hi. Come on in.

41:35.123 --> 41:37.642
So, spill it.

41:37.666 --> 41:39.644
What's the scoop
on the applewhites?

41:39.668 --> 41:41.676
Um, about that... um...

41:41.700 --> 41:44.208
Oh, Bree, come on, dish already!

41:44.232 --> 41:47.059
Well, perhaps I got
more excited than I should have,

41:47.083 --> 41:50.515
but I recently found out
that Betty applewhite

41:50.539 --> 41:53.157
is quite the poker player,

41:53.181 --> 41:56.891
and so, uh, I have invited her
to join our weekly game.

41:56.915 --> 41:59.524
Hello, everybody.

41:59.548 --> 42:01.526
I hope you brought
your checkbooks

42:01.550 --> 42:03.550
because I am feeling lucky.

42:09.658 --> 42:13.908
Everyone understands
the nature of war.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.680
I raise.

42:15.704 --> 42:19.018
We also understand that
victory depends on the cards

42:19.042 --> 42:20.585
that we have been dealt.

42:20.609 --> 42:23.718
Some, when faced
with a bloody battle,

42:23.742 --> 42:25.690
simply give in.

42:25.714 --> 42:29.093
But for some,
surrender is unacceptable.

42:29.117 --> 42:33.598
Well, Bree,
what are you gonna do?

42:33.622 --> 42:38.062
Even though they know
it will be a fight...

42:38.086 --> 42:40.204
I'll raise you.

42:40.228 --> 42:42.228
To the death.
