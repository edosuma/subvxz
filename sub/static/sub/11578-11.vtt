00:00.969 --> 00:02.976
In the criminal justice system

00:03.048 --> 00:04.707
sexually-based offenses

00:04.776 --> 00:06.433
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.536 --> 00:08.870
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives...

00:08.936 --> 00:10.691
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.759 --> 00:12.286
are members of an elite squad

00:12.359 --> 00:13.920
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.878
These are their stories.

00:27.014 --> 00:28.607
We spent $2 million
on this video.

00:28.678 --> 00:30.401
They better give it
heavy rotation.

00:31.175 --> 00:34.141
Any word on Ricki's new album?
Heavily pop.

00:34.214 --> 00:36.449
Hear they're holding it back
for the London concert.

00:36.517 --> 00:39.364
Jared's still on tour,
but Ricki's on her way here.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.949
You know recording sessions,
always running late.

00:42.020 --> 00:43.995
Where's the birthday boy?
Corbin?

00:44.069 --> 00:47.811
My assistant forgot to pick
up a card. He's probably...

00:48.868 --> 00:53.059
I think I know where he is. Hey,
Ashley, have you seen your brother?

00:53.123 --> 00:54.105
No.

00:55.332 --> 00:57.634
Sarah, where's Corbin?

00:57.700 --> 01:00.252
I saw him heading off to the
bathroom, five minutes ago.

01:01.027 --> 01:03.165
What the hell
is he doing here?

01:03.234 --> 01:04.958
No!
Oh, no.

01:06.051 --> 01:08.669
Corbin, are you all right?
Let me go.

01:11.650 --> 01:12.730
Stop!

01:14.210 --> 01:15.671
Wait! Come back!

01:16.769 --> 01:17.947
Corbin!

01:19.648 --> 01:20.793
Honey.

01:24.929 --> 01:26.205
Talk to the mother yet?

01:26.272 --> 01:28.280
Her people will let us know
when she's ready.

01:28.353 --> 01:29.847
That's her, in the leather.

01:33.536 --> 01:36.852
I want him arrested. There'll
be a full investigation.

01:36.927 --> 01:39.349
He molested my son.

02:31.547 --> 02:34.546
How many active investigations
are you two running?

02:34.619 --> 02:37.302
Twelve open rapes,
17 child abuse.

02:37.370 --> 02:41.112
I just got a call from the boys
upstairs. Make room for a VIP case.

02:41.178 --> 02:42.291
Who?

02:42.362 --> 02:46.136
Ricki Austin believes her son's
molester was responsible for his death.

02:46.201 --> 02:48.339
Paper doesn't mention anything
about a sex angle...

02:48.410 --> 02:50.514
but it talks about
straight vehicular.

02:50.584 --> 02:52.756
It goes on at great length
to say that Ricki was...

02:52.825 --> 02:55.094
female vocalist of the year,
two years running.

02:55.161 --> 02:58.837
The boy was chasing the man who
had molested him in a restroom.

02:58.905 --> 03:01.360
Stranger or acquaintance?
Former teacher.

03:01.432 --> 03:02.512
Someone he trusted.

03:02.584 --> 03:05.267
They tried for years to have
kids before they adopted Corbin...

03:05.336 --> 03:06.962
and the second they did...

03:07.032 --> 03:10.610
Ricki got pregnant, they have
a little girl named Ashley.

03:10.679 --> 03:11.858
Hey, I read People.

03:11.927 --> 03:14.927
She was that girl singing at county
fairs who snagged Jared Black...

03:14.999 --> 03:17.104
of Black Plague,
rock 'n' roll's bad boy.

03:17.975 --> 03:19.535
Rolling Stone.

03:19.606 --> 03:21.582
So when do we
roll out the red carpet?

03:21.654 --> 03:24.971
One Police Plaza
says you are to go to them.

03:28.246 --> 03:29.708
David Russo...

03:30.134 --> 03:32.949
he was Corbin's
computer teacher.

03:33.174 --> 03:35.410
We hired him
to tutor privately.

03:36.021 --> 03:37.678
Here you go, honey.

03:38.293 --> 03:40.562
Did you witness them
coming out of the bathroom?

03:40.853 --> 03:42.676
Corbin came out crying.

03:42.997 --> 03:45.516
Were they alone in there?
Yes.

03:45.589 --> 03:49.744
Corbin's dead because of him.
I want him charged with murder.

03:50.036 --> 03:52.524
We can't promise you anything,
but trust me...

03:52.596 --> 03:55.115
no one serves harder time in
prison than child molesters.

03:55.188 --> 03:57.904
I did everything I could
to keep him away from Corbin.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.492
He had a restraining order.
What had he done?

04:00.595 --> 04:04.010
He was inappropriately affectionate.
Constantly touching him.

04:04.082 --> 04:05.970
Did you talk
to Corbin about it?

04:06.035 --> 04:08.173
We fired Russo, we thought
that was the end of it.

04:08.242 --> 04:12.431
But when I came back from tour, he
was here in this house with Corbin.

04:12.498 --> 04:15.214
And that's when we took out
the restraining order.

04:15.282 --> 04:18.248
Was anyone present during
the tutoring sessions?

04:18.961 --> 04:21.349
The nanny, Sarah.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.470
Were you with them
at all times?

04:23.537 --> 04:24.879
I have Ashley, too.

04:25.329 --> 04:26.573
I came in and out.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.323
And when they were together
what did you see?

04:29.392 --> 04:32.589
He hugged him, all the time.

04:32.656 --> 04:34.150
Anything beyond that?

04:34.224 --> 04:35.565
Kisses.

04:35.631 --> 04:38.282
On the forehead,
the cheek.

04:38.927 --> 04:41.927
And just the way he looked at
Corbin. It wasn't teacherly.

04:42.479 --> 04:44.072
When Mr. Russo dropped by...

04:44.142 --> 04:46.150
did Corbin seem upset
or throw a temper tantrum?

04:46.224 --> 04:47.270
Hi...

04:49.294 --> 04:50.723
Ashley, right?

04:51.534 --> 04:53.421
What are we hiding from?

04:57.614 --> 05:00.548
So, what do you do when you're
not hiding under there?

05:00.622 --> 05:03.938
School and lessons.
Yeah, what kind of lessons?

05:04.173 --> 05:06.180
Tap, piano, ballet,
and singing.

05:06.252 --> 05:08.162
Wow. You're a lucky
little girl.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.565
Yeah.

05:11.948 --> 05:13.442
Did you ever take
computer lessons?

05:13.516 --> 05:16.712
I was gonna start,
but the tutor stopped coming.

05:16.781 --> 05:18.603
Did you know Mr. Russo?

05:19.372 --> 05:22.437
Yeah, but we weren't friends
like him and Corbin.

05:24.139 --> 05:26.049
Hey, what happened there?

05:26.763 --> 05:29.577
That's an accident.
What kind of accident?

05:34.827 --> 05:38.404
Ashley, did somebody hurt you?

05:38.858 --> 05:40.833
That was an accident, too.

05:43.241 --> 05:44.518
You ready?

05:46.121 --> 05:49.568
Okay, well, I gotta go. Maybe
we can talk again sometime.

05:50.152 --> 05:53.568
I'll look for you here or
under the sofa, how about that?

05:54.825 --> 05:58.240
I forgot your name.
It's Det. Benson...

05:58.600 --> 06:00.639
but you can call me Olivia.

06:02.376 --> 06:04.415
I'll see you later.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.487
Nanny said Russo was here four,
sometimes five days a week.

06:08.550 --> 06:09.565
Dedicated.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.876
Yeah, especially considering
he was only paid for two.

06:11.943 --> 06:12.991
How'd you do?

06:13.063 --> 06:15.397
Ashley claims that she didn't
have much contact with Russo...

06:15.463 --> 06:18.528
but her wrist was hurt and she
had bruises on her thigh.

06:18.597 --> 06:21.380
I think it's about time we
talk to this tutor. Yeah.

06:29.317 --> 06:31.706
If you're looking for David,
you missed him.

06:31.780 --> 06:34.083
You know where he was going?
No.

06:35.364 --> 06:38.081
He was crying.
Really? Any idea why?

06:38.181 --> 06:39.774
No, do you?

06:40.036 --> 06:41.824
How well do you
know Mr. Russo?

06:41.892 --> 06:45.568
I know enough to know
he was around more lately.

06:45.636 --> 06:48.505
During school hours.

06:48.580 --> 06:50.368
I think he got fired.

06:51.331 --> 06:54.113
Does he have a lot of company?
A girlfriend maybe?

06:54.180 --> 06:56.547
All I ever see are kids.
In his apartment?

06:56.611 --> 06:59.393
Coming in and out of here
all the time.

07:00.356 --> 07:02.177
I say we stick a uni
outside his apartment...

07:02.242 --> 07:03.900
and pick him up
the second he gets home.

07:03.970 --> 07:06.304
Based on what? Kids going
into their tutor's apartment...

07:06.371 --> 07:08.826
his hugging Corbin? 'Cause at
this point, that's all we've got.

07:08.898 --> 07:11.800
When he snuck into that party, he
violated the order of protection.

07:11.874 --> 07:13.281
We've got
criminal contempt charge.

07:13.346 --> 07:15.069
It's a misdemeanor,
he'll be out in two hours.

07:15.138 --> 07:16.185
We can do better than that.

07:16.257 --> 07:17.851
He's seeing kids
in that apartment alone.

07:17.921 --> 07:20.343
We need more ammunition
before we bring him in.

07:21.057 --> 07:22.104
And he was fired.

07:22.177 --> 07:25.526
Let's find out why the school didn't
want him teaching kids anymore.

07:27.456 --> 07:29.211
David was great
with the students.

07:29.281 --> 07:30.806
We were sorry
we had to let him go.

07:30.879 --> 07:32.505
Why did you?
Cutbacks.

07:32.576 --> 07:34.647
Looks like you're operating
on a shoestring budget.

07:34.719 --> 07:35.864
What's tuition here...

07:35.935 --> 07:38.619
about $10,000 a kid?
$17,000.

07:38.687 --> 07:41.469
You fired Russo a week
after Ricki Austin let him go.

07:41.535 --> 07:45.081
Bad for business, if parents catch
wind you have a pedophile on staff.

07:45.150 --> 07:46.776
I don't believe we did.

07:46.845 --> 07:49.398
Teaching meant everything
to David. When he came here...

07:49.471 --> 07:51.096
he said our system
was obsolete...

07:51.167 --> 07:53.271
and personally donated
a dozen new computers.

07:53.342 --> 07:56.657
On a teacher's salary? This was
his first teaching assignment.

07:56.734 --> 07:58.621
Where was he before this?

07:58.685 --> 08:02.482
Vanross Piller Investments.
He was their computer whiz kid.

08:02.909 --> 08:06.008
When your trading system takes
a dump on a volatile stock day...

08:06.077 --> 08:09.787
you pray for a Russo. So he
had a pretty important position?

08:09.852 --> 08:12.885
VP in MIS.
You mind decoding that?

08:12.956 --> 08:16.884
Management Information Systems. He
designed all the company's software...

08:16.955 --> 08:19.343
and he was just as
knowledgeable about hardware.

08:19.451 --> 08:22.266
A double threat. Must have
been sad to see him go.

08:22.331 --> 08:26.487
Sad is when the Dow swings
500 points. I was devastated.

08:26.619 --> 08:28.277
But he wanted
to work with kids.

08:28.347 --> 08:30.551
Just out of curiosity,
what does an MIS VP make?

08:30.618 --> 08:32.722
Starts at a $150,000.

08:36.186 --> 08:37.975
Masks are on the counter.

08:38.042 --> 08:42.131
Did you finish with the
celebrity's kid? He's in the fridge.

08:42.202 --> 08:45.398
The parents' "people" have been
raising holy hell to have him released.

08:45.465 --> 08:47.090
Any signs of sexual abuse?

08:47.161 --> 08:49.779
No fluids, no tearing, no
restraint marks, no bruising.

08:49.849 --> 08:52.369
Yeah, fondling
wouldn't leave any marks.

08:52.728 --> 08:55.183
Actually, take a look
for yourself.

09:04.215 --> 09:07.346
This seem odd to you?
He bit his nails.

09:07.415 --> 09:11.125
Down to the nub.
See this rash on his wrist?

09:11.926 --> 09:14.064
Stress-related eczema.

09:15.062 --> 09:17.615
Plus, his back teeth
are ground down.

09:18.294 --> 09:20.595
What was this kid
so anxious about?

09:23.414 --> 09:24.907
So, where are we?

09:24.981 --> 09:27.250
Single white male,
late 20s, highly educated.

09:27.318 --> 09:30.187
Gotta be around kids.
And a computer whiz.

09:30.293 --> 09:32.977
Somebody with a hankering
for Internet kiddie porn?

09:33.045 --> 09:34.638
That's why we're pulling
Russo's LUDs.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.367
If we get
his service provider...

09:36.437 --> 09:38.159
we can find out if he's
been hitting the sites.

09:38.229 --> 09:42.025
Maybe downloading, which would
nail him. All right. Get on it.

09:44.052 --> 09:46.091
How was Corbin's relationship
with his father?

09:46.164 --> 09:49.099
My guess is minimal. Jared's been
on tour longer than the Stones.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.119
Kid's always with nannies.

09:50.196 --> 09:52.170
Leaving him wanting
for a male authority figure.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.388
Like a teacher.

09:53.459 --> 09:55.215
Speaking of which,
we pulled Russo's LUDs.

09:55.283 --> 09:57.257
Don't tell me he wasn't up
to something on that computer.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.313
It's cyber evidence.

09:58.386 --> 10:00.394
That doesn't prove
that he molested Corbin.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.987
We don't have Forensics yet,
we have no eyewitness...

10:03.059 --> 10:05.130
and we don't have a living
victim to make a statement.

10:05.202 --> 10:06.282
That we know of.

10:06.354 --> 10:09.255
What do you say
we talk to the kids he tutors?

10:10.257 --> 10:13.324
He's way cool.
Everybody wanted Russo.

10:13.393 --> 10:17.452
Yeah? You got a computer
at home? Doesn't everybody?

10:18.417 --> 10:19.791
I guess they do.

10:19.856 --> 10:23.337
So, why would you go over
to his place to take lessons?

10:23.409 --> 10:24.816
He has the ultimate system.

10:24.912 --> 10:27.596
So, you know, you're over
there, did he ever get...

10:27.664 --> 10:30.532
you know, get physical with you?
Ever wrestle around with you?

10:30.608 --> 10:33.128
Mr. Russo? No.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.437
He ever hug you?
No.

10:35.503 --> 10:37.096
Okay, when's the last time
you saw him?

10:37.167 --> 10:38.541
Last week, at soccer practice.

10:38.607 --> 10:39.851
Yeah, what was he doing?

10:39.918 --> 10:43.399
Just watching. And then he
stayed after to talk to Corbin.

10:44.815 --> 10:45.763
Okay.

10:46.095 --> 10:50.185
Seth, that's it, man, I got
no more questions for you.

10:53.581 --> 10:57.476
He violated his restraining
order twice. Let's get a warrant.

11:04.013 --> 11:06.250
Somebody's skipping town.

11:06.316 --> 11:08.934
Two seconds ahead
of the search warrant.

11:14.124 --> 11:16.011
Pedophile on the run.

11:16.267 --> 11:17.674
Look at this.

11:25.258 --> 11:26.688
It's a shrine.

11:27.178 --> 11:29.480
He must have been following
his every move.

11:30.954 --> 11:32.580
What are you doing here?

11:32.650 --> 11:35.072
Teaching you the meaning
of a restraining order.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.816
David Russo,
you're under arrest.

11:46.345 --> 11:48.287
What are you doing with these?

11:48.361 --> 11:50.084
Some of these
are two years old...

11:50.154 --> 11:51.495
before you even
started teaching.

11:51.561 --> 11:53.797
Before you even met Corbin.

11:56.231 --> 11:57.922
He was an accessory.

11:58.215 --> 12:00.452
Like their diamonds
or Grammys.

12:02.087 --> 12:04.957
A trophy kid to pull out
for photo-ops.

12:07.367 --> 12:08.414
Mr. Russo...

12:08.487 --> 12:12.415
you got that job at Crestborne so
you could be near him, didn't you?

12:12.488 --> 12:13.435
Yes.

12:13.510 --> 12:16.893
And a tutoring position so
you could be alone with him?

12:17.575 --> 12:19.330
They were horrible parents.

12:19.399 --> 12:21.470
And I told them so.
Why do you think I got fired?

12:21.541 --> 12:24.803
Mr. Russo, we know why you were
fired. What'd you do with Corbin?

12:28.101 --> 12:31.898
I listened to him,
I encouraged him.

12:33.349 --> 12:34.876
You loved him.

12:39.748 --> 12:42.530
Why'd you bring him
in the bathroom? What?

12:44.804 --> 12:46.080
No...

12:46.147 --> 12:48.384
you can't be thinking...
You were obsessed with him...

12:48.451 --> 12:51.069
You don't understand.
They wouldn't let me near him.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.211
You stalked him.
No, I was leaving town.

12:53.283 --> 12:54.973
You were his teacher,
you gained his trust.

12:55.042 --> 12:58.272
You knew about his birthday. You
found out where his party was.

13:00.675 --> 13:02.561
You molested him.
No!

13:02.627 --> 13:04.829
Your whole world revolves
around this little boy.

13:04.898 --> 13:07.199
Now, why is that?
Explain that to me.

13:08.098 --> 13:09.788
Because he's my son.

13:19.105 --> 13:20.860
The tutor tells you
he's your daddy.

13:20.929 --> 13:22.358
That's gotta mess
with a kid's head.

13:22.432 --> 13:24.985
Russo says he never told him,
out of just that concern.

13:25.057 --> 13:26.103
A considerate psycho.

13:26.177 --> 13:27.736
He got a girl
pregnant at 17...

13:27.808 --> 13:30.077
put the baby up for adoption,
signed away all his rights.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.898
Ten years later,
it's still nagging at him.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.821
So Mr. Computer
starts searching the Net.

13:33.887 --> 13:36.886
Where he gets a hit on a famous
couple with an adopted boy...

13:36.959 --> 13:38.453
fixates on it being his.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.250
The guy's not
budging off his story.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.074
Then lets give him
a little push.

13:42.143 --> 13:44.728
Get on the adoption agency,
and put a rush on the DNA.

13:44.798 --> 13:47.896
Still, we don't have a living
CW, an eyewitness or forensics.

13:47.967 --> 13:50.421
No confession, no case...
No excuses.

13:50.494 --> 13:53.309
I've got media sniffing around
and the brass chomping at my ass.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.196
I want this closed yesterday.

13:57.885 --> 14:00.088
SVU, Detective Benson.

14:00.829 --> 14:04.177
Ashley, are you okay?

14:05.821 --> 14:07.543
We'll be right there.

14:11.964 --> 14:13.491
Hi, there.

14:13.691 --> 14:15.218
Olivia.

14:15.292 --> 14:16.885
Hi.

14:17.340 --> 14:20.153
What happened?
I fell.

14:20.603 --> 14:23.124
Where?
My stairs at home.

14:24.475 --> 14:26.896
Who was with you?
Nobody.

14:27.962 --> 14:28.911
Feel.

14:32.058 --> 14:34.097
That's a goose egg, all right.

14:36.985 --> 14:38.644
Ashley...

14:38.713 --> 14:41.266
you would let me know if there
was anything that I could do...

14:41.338 --> 14:43.508
to stop these accidents,
wouldn't you?

14:43.897 --> 14:45.905
You can't help accidents.

14:48.825 --> 14:50.515
No parents?

14:50.585 --> 14:52.952
Jared's probably
on a plane back from Europe.

14:53.016 --> 14:56.147
And Ricki?
Recording studio.

14:56.215 --> 14:58.125
She's back working already?

14:58.488 --> 15:01.008
People have different ways
of dealing with grief.

15:01.079 --> 15:05.421
Yeah, well, her kid's in the
hospital. Why the hell isn't she here?

15:06.327 --> 15:08.018
I can't.

15:08.983 --> 15:12.397
Everyone who works for them
signs a confidentiality agreement.

15:12.471 --> 15:14.706
I could lose my job
and be sued.

15:15.318 --> 15:18.133
Fair enough. Where were you
when Ashley fell?

15:18.422 --> 15:22.731
Packing up Corbin's room. I didn't
want to drag Ashley through that.

15:22.805 --> 15:25.139
How long have you
worked for them? A year.

15:25.205 --> 15:29.645
And in that time, how many
accidents has Ashley had?

15:30.836 --> 15:33.454
She's had accidents
all her life.

15:33.524 --> 15:35.117
You don't know how many
I've prevented...

15:35.188 --> 15:38.090
Sarah. Shouldn't you
be with Ashley?

15:38.804 --> 15:39.753
Yeah.

15:41.652 --> 15:44.302
What are you doing here?
Ashley called us.

15:44.371 --> 15:46.924
We thought we'd come down
and check in on her.

15:46.995 --> 15:49.451
I'm sorry she bothered you.

15:49.523 --> 15:51.824
I won't let it happen again.

15:57.522 --> 15:58.634
Sarah.

15:59.410 --> 16:02.923
Please, I really can't talk to
you. What's going on with Ashley?

16:02.993 --> 16:04.401
You know,
a criminal investigation...

16:04.465 --> 16:07.247
supersedes
a confidentiality agreement.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.167
Now, if somebody's hurting
this little girl...

16:09.234 --> 16:10.923
No, you misunderstood
what I said.

16:10.993 --> 16:13.360
I don't think we did.
Who are you covering for?

16:13.426 --> 16:16.523
Please, don't do this to me.
Is it Ricki? Is it Connie?

16:16.593 --> 16:18.959
Just tell us who it is.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.175
Called three times.

16:24.559 --> 16:26.316
Who? Maureen?
Not yours, yours.

16:26.416 --> 16:29.415
What? Who, Ashley?
What happened? Is she okay?

16:29.488 --> 16:33.798
No, she saw the new NSYNC video and
was sadly disappointed, as was I.

16:34.511 --> 16:36.137
She just called to chat.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.826
It's not funny, Munch.
Yeah, well try this.

16:38.894 --> 16:41.993
The adoption agency and
the DNA results confirm it.

16:42.063 --> 16:44.812
David Russo is Corbin's
biological father.

16:44.877 --> 16:47.399
Let's close this puppy out.
We can't.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.925
Why? Someone might
be abusing the sister.

16:49.999 --> 16:52.299
Don't do this to me. Who?
We don't know.

16:53.582 --> 16:55.108
Who made the complaint?
No one.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.409
But this kid has got
a long history of accidents.

16:58.573 --> 17:00.907
And?
She says they're accidents.

17:00.972 --> 17:05.227
We can't just fabricate child abuse
cases. Especially with high profiles.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.424
Captain, the nanny was this close
to giving something up to us.

17:08.492 --> 17:10.663
Just let us have
one more shot at her.

17:10.732 --> 17:12.968
The case is closed.
Leave them alone.

17:13.067 --> 17:16.231
Captain, we need
to inform Ricki about Russo.

17:16.299 --> 17:18.121
Do it by phone.

17:21.962 --> 17:25.310
Okay, we're in, we're out. We're
not even supposed to be here, right?

17:26.123 --> 17:27.268
Olivia!

17:27.945 --> 17:28.961
Hey.

17:29.546 --> 17:31.750
Ashley, you're in the middle
of a lesson.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.720
This is one of my best friends
and I hardly ever get to see her.

17:34.793 --> 17:36.037
You've got 10 minutes left.

17:36.105 --> 17:38.342
Actually, Ashley, I need
to talk to your mom, anyway.

17:38.409 --> 17:40.830
So I'll come say goodbye
before I leave, okay?

17:41.993 --> 17:43.454
Come on.

17:43.976 --> 17:47.010
Are you her piano teacher?
No, I'm her new nanny.

17:47.081 --> 17:49.601
What happened to Sarah?
I'll take care of this.

17:50.216 --> 17:54.210
What's your fascination with our
nannies? Just how many you go through.

17:54.279 --> 17:57.596
We thought we'd just drop by to
let you know Russo's been cleared.

17:57.671 --> 18:00.454
What? In fact, he's
Corbin's birth father.

18:01.576 --> 18:04.422
That can't be.
DNA tests confirmed it.

18:04.486 --> 18:06.690
It was a closed adoption.

18:06.758 --> 18:09.475
He must have broken
some law to find him. No.

18:09.542 --> 18:12.890
Was he planning to extort money? No.

18:12.966 --> 18:16.097
He just wanted to make sure
that his son was loved.

18:16.805 --> 18:20.482
Don't be naive. Wait and see
how quickly he sells his story.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.139
Ricki didn't even
register relief...

18:23.206 --> 18:25.246
when she found out that Corbin
hadn't been molested.

18:25.317 --> 18:26.812
We did drop
a bombshell on her.

18:26.885 --> 18:29.754
Excuse me,
they took her away.

18:29.829 --> 18:33.691
Who? Immigration.
Immigration took her away.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.826
Okay, are you talking
about Sarah?

18:36.900 --> 18:38.657
She got deported?
Is that what you're saying?

18:38.724 --> 18:41.626
I'm worried about the
little girl. Okay, why?

18:43.138 --> 18:45.178
Why?
No, I have to go now.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.699
But, miss, please, you need
to talk to us. No, I can't.

18:50.371 --> 18:52.792
What the hell is going on
in that house?

18:56.002 --> 18:58.588
You had no business going back
to that house.

18:58.658 --> 19:00.829
We were in the neighborhood.
I dragged him there.

19:00.898 --> 19:03.648
You have no grounds
for an investigation.

19:03.745 --> 19:07.128
Captain, they're covering
something up. They're celebrities...

19:07.202 --> 19:08.893
people pick
through their garbage...

19:08.961 --> 19:10.587
tape their cell phone
conversations...

19:10.656 --> 19:12.544
sell their intimate secrets.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.998
Covering up is second nature
to these people.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.407
Elliot. Boss, read the
ME's report on the boy.

19:17.473 --> 19:18.552
Just talk to her.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.413
That kid was a nervous wreck
about something.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.033
It's hot in the limelight and
this boy never asked to be there.

19:23.104 --> 19:26.420
Doesn't explain away Ashley's injuries,
or the fact that the one person who...

19:26.496 --> 19:29.593
decides to talk about them gets
deported. And we need to interview her.

19:29.663 --> 19:31.550
She's in England.
What do you want? Air fare?

19:31.615 --> 19:33.720
We'll take $4 for the tunnel.
We already checked.

19:33.791 --> 19:37.653
She's still at the INS detention
center in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

19:44.926 --> 19:47.128
I begged you
to leave me alone.

19:48.318 --> 19:49.265
We're sorry.

19:55.869 --> 19:58.519
The agent gave me
15 minutes to pack.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.595
Ashley was still at school...

20:01.660 --> 20:03.220
I didn't get to say goodbye.

20:03.293 --> 20:06.587
Sarah, there's nothing more
that they can do to you...

20:06.652 --> 20:09.619
but Ashley is still
in that house.

20:09.691 --> 20:11.317
Please, tell us
who's hurting her.

20:11.386 --> 20:13.776
I only wish
it were that simple.

20:13.851 --> 20:16.633
Her own mother
doesn't have time for her.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.481
The longer she's away,
the more hyper Ashley gets.

20:19.547 --> 20:23.539
I called Children's Services
once, anonymously.

20:23.865 --> 20:26.866
They do drugs.
Not just Jared. Ricki, too.

20:26.938 --> 20:30.135
You saw Ricki doing drugs?
No.

20:30.202 --> 20:31.958
But I've seen her
looking stoned.

20:32.025 --> 20:33.968
What about that incident
you reported?

20:34.041 --> 20:36.408
Ricki's accident.

20:36.473 --> 20:39.856
She fell asleep at the wheel
and hit a post.

20:39.928 --> 20:42.165
One of the rare times
she had the kids with her.

20:42.233 --> 20:45.811
Was anyone hurt?
The kids weren't, thank God.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.880
They were whisked away
before the police arrived.

20:48.952 --> 20:50.927
Ricki went to the hospital.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.076
What happened
with Children's Services?

20:53.143 --> 20:56.045
Ricki had it all tidied up
before they even started looking.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.549
Yeah, but there has to be
a police report.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.696
There has to be
hospital records.

20:59.767 --> 21:03.181
Power and money can make
anything go away.

21:10.518 --> 21:12.012
I understand you were
the attending...

21:12.086 --> 21:13.712
the night of Ricki Austin's
car accident.

21:13.781 --> 21:16.683
It was nothing. Checked and
released. Any complications?

21:16.758 --> 21:19.245
Yeah, I had to get through
the hospital's VIP liaison...

21:19.317 --> 21:21.619
and three of her handlers
before I could examine her.

21:21.685 --> 21:23.692
I'm wearing a lab coat.
Who'd they think I was?

21:23.765 --> 21:25.423
Obviously a reporter
in disguise.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.085
The story never made
the papers.

21:27.157 --> 21:29.045
Celebrities have to
use pseudonyms...

21:29.108 --> 21:31.083
or the hospital
would be overrun with fans.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.229
What name does Ricki
usually use?

21:33.300 --> 21:35.209
Sorry,
it's doctor-patient privilege.

21:35.284 --> 21:36.429
So, what were the extent
of her injuries?

21:36.500 --> 21:37.579
Off the record.

21:37.652 --> 21:39.889
Minor. Head laceration
and a bloody nose.

21:39.955 --> 21:42.410
Way we heard it,
she was babbling incoherently.

21:42.483 --> 21:45.232
She was shaken up from the
accident. Minor as it was.

21:45.299 --> 21:47.666
You do a tox screen?
No.

21:47.730 --> 21:49.803
You come in with those
exact symptoms at Bellevue...

21:49.874 --> 21:51.434
it's automatic.

21:52.403 --> 21:55.272
If you'll excuse me,
I have rounds.

21:55.346 --> 21:58.247
Different treatment for the
rich and the poor. What's new?

21:58.322 --> 22:00.012
Same hospital
they brought Ashley.

22:00.082 --> 22:01.510
Be nice to look
at her medical history.

22:01.585 --> 22:03.952
It's never gonna happen
without a subpoena.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.708
Ashley acts out.

22:05.777 --> 22:09.159
I'm very fond of her, but
she's very disruptive in class.

22:09.233 --> 22:11.567
Class clown disruptive?
She talks through class...

22:11.632 --> 22:13.837
and gets upset when other
students won't talk back.

22:13.904 --> 22:15.180
She's starved
for attention.

22:15.248 --> 22:17.637
Positive or negative,
it doesn't matter.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.784
She starts fights with
the slightest provocation.

22:19.857 --> 22:22.027
Does Ashley have
a lot of accidents at school?

22:22.096 --> 22:25.161
She's fallen off bleachers,
playground equipment.

22:25.232 --> 22:27.816
She's always showing off.
"Look at me" accidents.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.000
So what have you done
about her?

22:29.071 --> 22:32.104
When she disrupts class,
I send her to the steps.

22:32.271 --> 22:35.085
You make her run steps?
No, out here.

22:36.590 --> 22:38.084
When a student
gets in trouble...

22:38.158 --> 22:40.973
they're sent to step one,
for a 10 minute time-out.

22:41.038 --> 22:43.590
Second offense, step two.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.996
Ashley's a repeat
step three offender.

22:46.061 --> 22:49.378
I think she needs help,
not punishment. So do I.

22:49.453 --> 22:51.755
I sent letters home,
they were never answered.

22:51.821 --> 22:53.348
I finally took it
to the headmaster.

22:53.420 --> 22:55.111
We've met him.
What did Parsons do?

22:55.180 --> 22:58.758
He told her parents Ashley had
to see a therapist or be expelled.

22:58.828 --> 23:01.893
Is therapy helping?
She's not getting therapy.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.386
It didn't sit well
with her parents.

23:04.460 --> 23:07.559
But, hey, they did donate
a new library.

23:08.204 --> 23:10.309
Where does that leave Ashley?

23:10.572 --> 23:12.132
Out on the steps.

23:13.260 --> 23:15.561
Anyone gets close to helping
her, Ricki buys a wall...

23:15.627 --> 23:16.805
to block them off.

23:16.874 --> 23:18.882
And I think we've
definitely hit ours.

23:18.955 --> 23:20.678
There's gotta be something
that we can do.

23:20.746 --> 23:23.496
What? They don't abuse her, they
don't criminally neglect her.

23:23.562 --> 23:25.286
They don't love her.
What?

23:25.353 --> 23:27.656
How many unloved kids you
think there are in this city?

23:27.721 --> 23:31.037
It's not an SVU case anymore.
You just gotta let it go.

23:33.801 --> 23:37.031
Yeah, right. Hold on.

23:38.377 --> 23:41.922
I got the 2-7 on three. They've
got Ashley. Why? What happened?

23:41.993 --> 23:44.992
She just walked in to the desk
sergeant, then asked for you.

23:45.064 --> 23:48.413
Okay, put her through. Remember
our little talk yesterday?

23:48.487 --> 23:50.877
She's reaching out to me,
what am I supposed to do?

23:50.951 --> 23:52.958
Have a uni drive her home.

23:54.663 --> 23:56.551
This is Benson.

23:56.614 --> 23:59.614
Hey, can somebody watch her?
We'll be there in about 10 minutes.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.214
Okay.

24:02.886 --> 24:04.380
Don't look at me.

24:16.646 --> 24:18.468
Olivia.
Hey.

24:18.596 --> 24:21.150
They left you in here
all by yourself?

24:21.220 --> 24:24.701
Officer Garvey came in for
a minute, but she had to go.

24:24.772 --> 24:27.806
She wasn't that much
fun anyway. Ashley...

24:28.517 --> 24:31.746
did something happen?
Are you okay?

24:31.812 --> 24:34.016
Yeah, I just wanted
to see you.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.657
Didn't you have school today?

24:38.724 --> 24:42.684
I ditched, then I took
a cab here. Ashley.

24:42.754 --> 24:44.510
They must have
called your mother by now...

24:44.579 --> 24:46.815
I'm sure she's worried sick
about you.

24:46.882 --> 24:48.027
She doesn't care.

24:48.098 --> 24:51.675
She's probably going out of her
mind. I'm taking you home, let's go.

24:51.746 --> 24:55.423
No, I wanted us to hang out
today. We can't, I'm working.

24:55.490 --> 24:59.319
But I won't get in your way,
I promise. I can help you.

24:59.394 --> 25:01.051
Ashley, you know how
you can help me...

25:01.122 --> 25:03.577
you can help me by never ever
doing this again.

25:03.649 --> 25:05.624
Do you understand that?
Now let's go, come on.

25:05.698 --> 25:07.355
No.
Ashley.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.437
Ashley, you're bleeding.
I'm okay.

25:16.895 --> 25:18.870
Is your mother home?

25:20.223 --> 25:21.565
She never is.

25:27.839 --> 25:30.206
Come on, okay?

25:34.495 --> 25:39.229
# But I wish
I loved you then #

25:40.029 --> 25:45.692
# The way I love you now ##

25:48.060 --> 25:50.646
Ashley Austin Black,
you get in here.

25:53.597 --> 25:56.891
Why do you do this to me?
Let me see it.

25:57.884 --> 26:00.536
Miss Austin, is there a place
we could speak privately?

26:00.604 --> 26:02.775
Detective, you really shouldn't
have gone out of your way.

26:02.844 --> 26:04.186
My driver would have
picked her up.

26:04.251 --> 26:06.324
Olivia doesn't mind.
She's my friend.

26:06.395 --> 26:09.046
It's important that we speak.
This is not a good day.

26:09.116 --> 26:11.733
Ricki, we've only
got the studio till 4:30.

26:11.835 --> 26:13.558
We still have two tracks
to lay down.

26:13.626 --> 26:16.277
Honey, look, why don't you
just go in the green room...

26:16.347 --> 26:19.892
with Connie and you have her
get you something to eat, okay?

26:19.963 --> 26:23.224
But can't I stay with you?
No honey, mommy's working.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.519
Then can Olivia stay with me?
No, she can't.

26:26.618 --> 26:29.203
Now just go, okay?

26:31.417 --> 26:33.239
Thank you, Detective.

26:33.784 --> 26:36.402
Okay, let's try it again.

26:39.385 --> 26:41.273
She calls all the time.

26:41.336 --> 26:43.093
What happens when you
have to hang up?

26:43.448 --> 26:45.717
At first she begs to talk,
just for a few more minutes...

26:45.784 --> 26:48.685
and then when I have to go,
she just...

26:48.760 --> 26:50.189
She sounds so depressed.

26:50.263 --> 26:52.532
When you first met, how much
time did you spend together?

26:52.599 --> 26:56.625
Just a few minutes. It sounds
like reactive attachment disorder.

26:56.695 --> 26:58.287
It is very common
in orphans...

26:58.359 --> 27:00.976
who are abandoned during
their crucial bonding cycle.

27:01.047 --> 27:04.788
They meet complete strangers and
they form instant relationships.

27:04.854 --> 27:07.057
So it's not just
my sparkling wit?

27:07.126 --> 27:10.422
I have one patient who meets a
stranger and she goes up and hugs them.

27:10.485 --> 27:11.893
She goes to the market...

27:11.957 --> 27:14.576
and tells the checkout girl
that she loves her.

27:14.645 --> 27:15.923
That fits.

27:16.917 --> 27:18.739
But Ashley keeps getting hurt.

27:18.805 --> 27:22.219
It's part of the package.
And it could escalate.

27:22.293 --> 27:24.201
Is there treatment?

27:24.277 --> 27:26.480
I could start her on
corrective attachment therapy...

27:26.548 --> 27:29.231
but, Olivia, I'd have to see
the mother and daughter together.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.188
It's never gonna happen.

27:32.243 --> 27:36.553
If she's in imminent risk, Children's
Services could mandate therapy.

27:38.484 --> 27:39.661
I'm sorry.

27:39.731 --> 27:42.000
Come on, there's gotta be
something that you can do?

27:42.066 --> 27:43.528
For emotional abuse?
No.

27:43.604 --> 27:45.872
Ricki was reported before
for the car accident.

27:45.939 --> 27:47.345
You did nothing
about that, either.

27:47.411 --> 27:49.799
You're busting my shoes
over this?

27:49.874 --> 27:53.190
I'm handling 32 families.

27:53.266 --> 27:56.779
I've got babies with skull
fractures, 10-year-old prostitutes.

27:56.849 --> 27:59.402
I understand that,
I handle the same cases.

27:59.474 --> 28:02.888
But that shouldn't mean that this little
girl has to fall through the cracks.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.748
Look, it's not that
I don't care.

28:04.848 --> 28:06.605
But with a high-publicity mom
like that...

28:06.672 --> 28:09.542
I could spend weeks just
trying to get an appointment.

28:09.617 --> 28:10.860
Okay, so do it.

28:10.928 --> 28:13.895
I've got a kid
in the burn ward about to die.

28:13.968 --> 28:15.461
It's triage.

28:15.536 --> 28:17.903
You tell me who should get
my attention the most...

28:17.967 --> 28:20.520
your one girl
or my battered 30.

28:26.510 --> 28:28.899
Please ask Ricki
to call me when she gets in.

28:28.974 --> 28:29.922
Thank you.

28:34.445 --> 28:37.609
Olivia!
Hey, kiddo.

28:37.901 --> 28:40.290
I can't believe you came.
How you doing?

28:40.365 --> 28:42.701
You have to come see my room.
Next time, sweetheart.

28:42.765 --> 28:44.837
No, please, just for a
minute? No, I gotta go.

28:44.909 --> 28:46.797
Ashley, she can't come in. Let's go. No.

28:46.860 --> 28:49.282
No, really, sweetheart.
I gotta go, next time. No.

28:49.357 --> 28:51.974
Ashley, come inside.
No, not without Olivia.

28:52.044 --> 28:53.899
Make her come in.
She can't.

28:53.964 --> 28:55.491
Ashley.
No.

28:55.564 --> 28:58.314
Ashley! Stop!

29:03.563 --> 29:04.992
Give her to me.
Let go of me.

29:05.067 --> 29:07.751
Give her to me. It's okay.
Get her inside.

29:07.820 --> 29:10.373
No!
What's the matter?

29:10.443 --> 29:13.825
What are you doing here?
Your daughter needs help.

29:13.898 --> 29:16.932
I talked to a psychologist
who... You did what?

29:17.003 --> 29:19.206
This psychologist
can help her.

29:19.274 --> 29:21.477
The thing is, she needs to see
the both of you together.

29:21.546 --> 29:23.651
Leave us alone. Ricki,
your daughter needs help.

29:23.722 --> 29:27.071
Get away, before I call the police.
Miss Austin, I am the police.

29:27.145 --> 29:29.895
Then it's damn lucky
I have my own security.

29:38.025 --> 29:39.454
Morning, Olivia.

29:41.832 --> 29:44.221
This doesn't look like
the makings of a pleasant day.

29:44.296 --> 29:47.427
Ashley's called already,
six times.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.405
What's wrong?
Don't ask.

29:49.479 --> 29:51.868
Benson, you're on desk duty.

29:51.942 --> 29:53.884
Captain, I can explain.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.220
You can't follow my orders on the
street, you try keeping my files straight.

29:57.287 --> 29:59.359
Captain... And in case
anyone else here...

29:59.430 --> 30:01.154
has Det. Benson's
hearing problem...

30:01.222 --> 30:03.295
read my lips
or buy the CliffsNotes.

30:03.365 --> 30:05.635
No one is to go
near Ashley Black again.

30:05.702 --> 30:10.077
That includes her family, school,
house, and any employees therein.

30:10.150 --> 30:13.466
You can't do this.
Somebody's gotta help her.

30:13.542 --> 30:17.338
Really. Well, thanks to you,
now none of us can.

30:22.981 --> 30:25.534
It's a restraining order...

30:26.243 --> 30:28.131
against the whole unit.

30:36.899 --> 30:40.608
Alex, you can't imagine
how needy this little girl is.

30:40.675 --> 30:44.024
"Needy?" Olivia, we do
sex crimes and child abuse.

30:44.098 --> 30:45.986
I'm sorry, but there's
not much we can do...

30:46.050 --> 30:47.643
for the emotionally
short-changed.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.142
What about abandonment?

30:49.219 --> 30:51.771
Her parents tour
nine months out of the year.

30:51.842 --> 30:56.119
Her father is a documented
alcoholic. And what about Corbin?

30:56.193 --> 30:58.233
That was a traffic accident.

30:58.914 --> 31:03.702
The autopsy report lists physical
evidence of long-term stress.

31:04.384 --> 31:07.166
He internalized,
she externalizes.

31:07.232 --> 31:10.396
You're speculating.
Not about Ashley's disorder.

31:10.464 --> 31:14.522
Ashley's tantrums, her
running away, her accidents.

31:14.591 --> 31:17.690
It could only escalate.
Olivia, why are you doing this?

31:17.760 --> 31:19.963
Because this kid
is in trouble.

31:23.070 --> 31:25.339
We might have
imminent risk of harm.

31:25.406 --> 31:27.643
There must be something
that you can do about that.

31:27.711 --> 31:31.387
Maybe, but we still have
one major hurdle.

31:31.454 --> 31:34.520
Are you trying to get fired? Because
that's the only option I have left.

31:34.589 --> 31:37.721
Would I put myself on the line if
I didn't know what was in store...

31:37.790 --> 31:40.245
for this little girl? She's
been hurting herself for years.

31:40.318 --> 31:41.942
We can subpoena
her medical records.

31:42.014 --> 31:43.540
And her teacher
and the headmaster.

31:43.613 --> 31:45.468
They saw the problem,
but did nothing about it.

31:45.533 --> 31:48.435
Parents wouldn't let them.
What are you thinking?

31:49.309 --> 31:53.302
An Article 10 proceeding. We can
remove the girl from the home.

31:53.372 --> 31:55.259
That is gonna play great
in the press.

31:55.325 --> 31:56.786
It's family court,
not criminal.

31:56.860 --> 31:58.616
And I've already made
a couple of phone calls.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.473
There isn't a less
disruptive avenue?

32:00.540 --> 32:02.034
None that Ricki
can't circumvent.

32:02.108 --> 32:04.825
She's already circumvented us.
We're under a restraining order.

32:04.891 --> 32:07.990
It's an active investigation.
I'll get it lifted.

32:13.275 --> 32:14.388
Do it.

32:17.882 --> 32:20.403
Olivia!
No, please, don't do that.

32:20.473 --> 32:24.216
Ashley, honey, look at me. I
want you to go with Det. Stabler.

32:24.281 --> 32:26.736
It's okay. I want you
to go with Det. Stabler, okay?

32:26.810 --> 32:27.856
Honey, come.
Please, no.

32:27.930 --> 32:30.231
It's okay, I'll be right out.
I don't wanna go with you.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.119
I wanna stay with Olivia.
Let go of me!

32:32.184 --> 32:34.257
This isn't fair.
Let go of me!

32:35.513 --> 32:38.294
This warrant charges you with
impairment of emotional health...

32:38.360 --> 32:41.207
Article 10, Section 1024,
of the Family Court Act.

32:41.272 --> 32:42.320
Impairment of what?

32:42.391 --> 32:44.943
You do have the right to be
present at a hearing on Thursday...

32:45.016 --> 32:47.918
at which time a judge will
determine Ashley's placement.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.728
Why are you doing this to me?

32:56.759 --> 33:00.533
This isn't about you,
it's about Ashley.

33:04.662 --> 33:06.572
I'll be back in a minute.

33:09.877 --> 33:12.244
So?
Nothing.

33:13.493 --> 33:15.827
Anything?
That's it.

33:15.893 --> 33:18.642
I'm empty. No family
member will take her.

33:18.709 --> 33:21.010
No one wants
to lose their meal ticket.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.267
So what happens now?

33:25.333 --> 33:27.917
Emergency foster care
for tonight. Where?

33:27.988 --> 33:30.257
There's room at Laight Street.

33:30.323 --> 33:33.552
I'll drop her off.
No, I'll drive her there.

33:34.899 --> 33:37.135
Can we go home
to your house now?

33:37.203 --> 33:40.137
Sweetie, we're not going
to my house.

33:40.210 --> 33:43.788
What? But you came and got me.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.624
You don't want me to live with
you? It's not that, Ashley...

33:47.697 --> 33:50.512
it's just that my house
isn't set up for kids.

33:50.578 --> 33:53.741
That's okay.
And even if it was...

33:53.810 --> 33:55.151
I'm hardly ever there.

33:55.217 --> 33:58.829
You know, my work, it just...
It takes up all my time.

33:59.536 --> 34:02.057
You understand that, Ashley,
don't you?

34:15.311 --> 34:17.449
What are you still doing here?

34:18.382 --> 34:21.579
You drop her off at Laight Street? Yeah.

34:22.670 --> 34:25.224
Never been there before.

34:28.014 --> 34:30.534
It's a room filled
with a dozen cots.

34:33.550 --> 34:36.167
It's been about a month now,
hasn't it?

34:36.717 --> 34:38.027
Since what?

34:39.021 --> 34:42.085
Your mom.
Where did that come from?

34:43.853 --> 34:47.168
Olivia, it's me. I know
the issues you had with her.

34:47.373 --> 34:50.306
No. No connection.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.379
Successful woman, rarely home,
when she was home, she was drunk.

34:53.452 --> 34:54.945
You were lonely
and neglected...

34:55.020 --> 34:58.848
and you never had a chance to
resolve the thing before she died?

35:02.091 --> 35:03.519
You're wrong.

35:08.682 --> 35:10.471
I'll get you a coffee.

35:17.257 --> 35:18.981
Your Honor, James Woodrow...

35:19.050 --> 35:21.221
for the respondents,
Ricki Austin and Jared Black.

35:21.289 --> 35:24.802
I'm filing a 1028 application to
return the minor to her parents.

35:24.873 --> 35:25.854
Fine.

35:25.929 --> 35:28.034
I'll hear that right now.
Your Honor, we feel that...

35:28.104 --> 35:29.664
I'm gravely distressed
by the fact...

35:29.737 --> 35:32.606
that police bypassed this court
and took the extreme measure...

35:32.681 --> 35:34.306
of removing a minor
from her home.

35:34.376 --> 35:36.928
You Honor, the minor has a chronic
history of self-injurious...

35:37.000 --> 35:39.170
behavior casually linked
to the home situation...

35:39.240 --> 35:42.884
Save it for later. I promise
we won't forget about you.

35:42.952 --> 35:45.188
Mr. Woodrow, you're up.

35:45.255 --> 35:47.873
I call Ricki Austin.

35:48.295 --> 35:50.183
We were dirt poor...

35:50.246 --> 35:52.069
so I always swore that
if I made any money...

35:52.135 --> 35:54.306
I was gonna spend all of it
on my children.

35:54.823 --> 35:57.441
I wanted them to have
everything they ever wanted.

35:57.862 --> 36:00.479
Everything I never had.
In order to do that...

36:00.550 --> 36:03.136
you've been very driven
in your career, haven't you?

36:03.206 --> 36:05.726
I'm a workaholic. I admit it.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.836
Has that kept you
from loving your daughter?

36:07.910 --> 36:08.857
No.

36:10.949 --> 36:13.283
Ashley was my miracle baby.

36:13.605 --> 36:17.183
My first song to become number
one, was about her birth.

36:18.436 --> 36:22.331
Sixteen million people could
relate to a mother's love.

36:22.404 --> 36:24.291
Is that domestic or worldwide?

36:24.356 --> 36:25.370
Your Honor...

36:25.443 --> 36:29.120
We have contempt charges here
in family court also, Miss Cabot.

36:29.764 --> 36:31.868
The woman who started
these proceedings...

36:31.940 --> 36:35.550
Detective Benson. How did she
become involved in your life?

36:36.514 --> 36:38.969
When I lost my son, Corbin...

36:39.875 --> 36:42.875
I was out of my mind
with grief.

36:42.946 --> 36:45.247
I was convinced that a man
had been hurting him...

36:45.313 --> 36:48.379
and she was one of the
detectives assigned to the case.

36:48.449 --> 36:50.206
And during
the investigation...

36:50.273 --> 36:53.622
did it become necessary to
take out a restraining order?

36:53.697 --> 36:55.965
Objection.
Overruled.

36:56.033 --> 36:59.993
I had to. Det. Benson
became obsessed with Ashley.

37:03.008 --> 37:05.048
Miss Austin,
did you ever grow concerned...

37:05.120 --> 37:08.218
over the inordinate number
of injuries your daughter has?

37:08.384 --> 37:13.119
Ashley's full of life. It's
hard to contain that energy.

37:13.376 --> 37:16.222
I mean, all kids have
accidents. I know I always did.

37:16.288 --> 37:17.717
Kids will be kids.

37:19.423 --> 37:23.350
On July 13, 1996,
Ashley sprained her wrist.

37:23.423 --> 37:24.983
Where were you?

37:25.726 --> 37:28.214
I... It was a long time ago, I know.

37:28.286 --> 37:29.268
Maybe this will help.

37:29.343 --> 37:31.676
It's your tour schedule
for the last five years.

37:36.093 --> 37:38.646
I gave a concert in Chicago.

37:38.718 --> 37:41.367
And on December 9, 1997?

37:44.541 --> 37:47.257
The German leg
of my European tour.

37:47.325 --> 37:50.139
Also the date Ashley
dislocated her elbow.

37:50.523 --> 37:53.142
Where were you for her
multiple rib fractures?

37:54.748 --> 37:58.522
What date is that?
Dates. I said multiple.

37:58.588 --> 38:02.962
March 23, 1998, August 9, 1999. Stop it.

38:03.035 --> 38:06.231
There are also lacerations to
the upper and lower extremities.

38:06.299 --> 38:07.443
Objection.

38:07.515 --> 38:11.093
A periorbital fracture, various
foreign bodies lodged in her ears...

38:11.194 --> 38:12.754
a fractured left femur.
Stop it.

38:12.826 --> 38:13.774
Objection!

38:13.850 --> 38:16.468
Contusions and abrasions to the
forehead, chin, hands and knees.

38:16.538 --> 38:17.880
That's enough, Miss Cabot.

38:19.898 --> 38:23.159
All of these injuries correlate
to dates you were away.

38:23.225 --> 38:26.672
You never saw them as a desperate
cry for Mommy to come home?

38:28.473 --> 38:30.130
I love my daughter.

38:31.417 --> 38:33.488
I loved both of my children.

38:35.288 --> 38:37.426
I gave them the best
of everything.

38:37.496 --> 38:40.114
The best schools, the best
nannies, the best home.

38:42.775 --> 38:45.109
I did everything
I could for them.

38:49.110 --> 38:50.867
No further questions.

38:53.366 --> 38:55.538
You may step down,
Miss Austin.

38:57.718 --> 38:59.757
Bailiff, bring in the child.

39:09.652 --> 39:12.554
Hello, Ashley.
Hi.

39:14.356 --> 39:16.690
Do you know why
you're here today?

39:18.676 --> 39:22.899
Do you know Det. Benson?
She used to be my friend.

39:23.924 --> 39:27.022
"Used to be?"
I wanted to live with her.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.009
But she didn't want me.

39:33.139 --> 39:34.567
My daddy's home.

39:48.146 --> 39:51.527
I am ordering the minor
be returned to her parents.

39:51.633 --> 39:55.048
But the Article 10 will continue.
I am recommending that ACS...

39:55.120 --> 39:58.153
monitor the home,
and set up family counseling.

39:58.224 --> 40:00.613
I want a status report
in one month.

40:00.688 --> 40:02.281
There won't be much to report,
Your Honor...

40:02.352 --> 40:04.327
because she begins a
three-month tour next week...

40:04.401 --> 40:07.498
and her daughter needs to
be in school. Ms. Austin?

40:07.568 --> 40:09.672
I'll postpone that tour,
Your Honor.

40:09.999 --> 40:11.461
Wise decision.

40:19.886 --> 40:23.116
I want you to know that my
only concern was for Ashley.

40:23.344 --> 40:27.565
You ever get near her again,
I'll have your badge.

40:29.902 --> 40:31.047
Gorgeous!

40:44.076 --> 40:46.378
How is it out there
in the real world?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.648
Give him a few more days to cool off.

40:49.324 --> 40:51.265
He'll let you off ass-duty.

40:51.340 --> 40:54.438
Just in time for my hearing in
front of the disciplinary committee.

40:54.508 --> 40:57.093
I see them next week.
Was it worth it?

40:58.379 --> 41:01.924
I don't know.
I think it woke her up.

41:13.226 --> 41:16.127
Son of a bitch.
What?

41:17.450 --> 41:21.127
Ricki Austin played to a sold-out
crowd in London last night.

41:22.305 --> 41:28.754
