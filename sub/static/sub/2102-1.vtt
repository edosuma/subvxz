02:44.400 --> 02:45.606
Herschel?

06:23.520 --> 06:27.002
Hello, Max. I'm dropping these off.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.844
They were my Albert's shoes.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.367
They shouldn't go to waste.
You should sell them.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.851
I don't sell shoes...

06:33.000 --> 06:34.684
And his overcoat
is in there too.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.286
It's very nice,
you should wear it.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.241
Well, I don't... You should
take your coat, I don't need it.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.884
Um, $16 dollars.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.331
So, where did you go?

06:49.920 --> 06:51.809
Oh, yeah?
Who else was there?

06:53.560 --> 06:54.891
Thanks.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.805
Hm. Sir, you have a light?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.128
- No, uh... Do I...
- Excuse me, sir?

07:01.280 --> 07:02.770
- Do you have a light?
- Sure.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.160
Thank you.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.648
Thanks. Sorry.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.008
Yeah, I know, he thinks
he's adorable.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.049
All right, cheers.
Hello, mate. You all right?

07:15.240 --> 07:16.526
Hey.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.726
Well.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.600
Morning, kid.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.364
Morning, Jimmy.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.561
No that's an
attractive looking couple.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.330
- Bye.
- Yeah.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.801
- Come on.
- All right, I've gotta go.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.041
If they ever have a kid,

07:36.200 --> 07:37.929
you won't be able to look
directly at it.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.565
What about you?
Max, you got any prospects?

07:48.720 --> 07:50.563
Me? No.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.049
Well, you should.
You're a good-looking guy.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.288
Gotta good job.
That kid's got nothing on you.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.601
He's got his own driver.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.240
What, you've got somewhere
you wanna go?

08:01.560 --> 08:02.721
I don't know.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.484
Maybe it's about time I figured
out my own thing, you know.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.324
You're a cobbler,
that's your thing.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.084
That's my father's thing.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.481
And his father before that.
You should be proud.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.521
Well, I gotta
get back to work.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.360
Hey hey, how's your mother?
Did you give her those pears?

08:20.240 --> 08:21.526
I did. She says thank you.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.205
All right, let her know it...

08:26.640 --> 08:27.766
Kids.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.690
Hi. Is this your shop?

08:36.799 --> 08:38.404
No, it's actually my father's.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.291
- Is he here?
- No, he is not.

08:41.679 --> 08:44.411
Well, I'm trying to talk to all
of the proprietors in the area.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.800
Do you expect him back soon?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.331
No, I don't expect him
back soon. Can I help you?

08:50.720 --> 08:52.848
OK, um, I'm sorry,
uh, what's your name?

08:53.480 --> 08:55.130
Max Simkin.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.884
Well, Max, I'm Carmen Herrara

08:57.040 --> 08:58.451
from the Lower East Side
Action Committee.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.687
OK.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.842
Basically, we're dedicated to
the preservation

09:02.000 --> 09:03.206
and rejuvenation
of the Lower East Side.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.328
We're trying to stop
real estate developers

09:05.520 --> 09:06.521
from converting the
neighborhood

09:06.680 --> 09:08.648
into luxury housing
and retail spaces,

09:08.800 --> 09:10.040
forcing the regular
people out.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.767
- How are they forcing them out?
- Money.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.922
I mean, they buy them out
or they raise the rent.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.524
How much do you think I'd get
for a place like this?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.685
That doesn't matter.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.286
It does to me.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.890
Max, we need people
like you to stay.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.242
That's why we're doing
all of this.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.280
Well, maybe you should've
checked with me first,

09:31.400 --> 09:33.368
make sure I wanna stay.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.811
Yeah, that's fair.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.723
You know what, come here,
I'm gonna show you something.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.369
Look around you, Max.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.644
What do you see?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.361
- The city.
- Exactly.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.127
The city, a living city.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.163
And your shop
is a part of it.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.761
How long have you had
this shop for, Max?

10:01.920 --> 10:03.206
Fourth generation.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.040
That's amazing.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.761
See, this is not just
a playground for the rich.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.405
It is for all of us.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.721
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, I guess.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.442
Good.
So could you sign this?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.365
- OK.
- Great, thanks.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.491
Do you have plans tonight?

10:23.640 --> 10:24.641
Excuse me?

10:24.800 --> 10:26.280
There's a rally,
if you're interested.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.327
Here, here's a flyer.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.130
Mr. Solomon is a wonderful old
man who lives on Grand Street

10:33.280 --> 10:35.328
and they're trying to evict him
from this apartment.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.881
OK.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.441
Our office is on
Orchard Street. Come by.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.849
You should really
get involved, Max.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.286
OK.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.841
OK.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.647
Hey, did you get her number?

10:56.840 --> 10:59.002
It's not that.

11:26.800 --> 11:27.926
Ma?

11:29.040 --> 11:30.121
Mm-hm.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.881
Ah.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.371
What are you doing here?

11:36.360 --> 11:39.170
- Break your eardrums.
- Did you bring any pears?

11:40.400 --> 11:43.324
I brought you pears yesterday,
Ma, remember, from Jimmy?

11:44.440 --> 11:47.171
Yes, call Papa,
tell him to bring pears.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.249
- OK, I will.
- Good boy. How was work?

11:51.680 --> 11:54.047
Work was, uh, the same
as every other day.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.082
Why don't you call
the Rabinowitz girl?

11:57.840 --> 12:00.650
Take her out on a date this
weekend. She always liked you.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.930
Uh, she got married ten years
ago, she's got three kids.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.806
She's a pretty girl.
You should step up to the plate.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.808
Um... OK.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.847
I will but not tonight.
You ready for dinner?

12:20.120 --> 12:22.168
Yeah, it's in the microwave.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.691
Yo, shoe man?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.410
Come on, let's go, man,
time's money.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.325
What's up, man,
come on, hook me up.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.445
Yeah, sure.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.367
How you doing today, my G?
Working hard?

13:08.560 --> 13:10.881
- Yes.
- Yeah? Good. Good.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.121
Can't knock the hustle.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.844
Work hard, play harder,
right, player?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.964
God bless Americola.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.651
Like that watch, huh?

13:23.800 --> 13:24.881
Sure.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.890
Shit, got a collection at home
worth three times this shop.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.649
Can always tell a man
by his watch, right, shoe man?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.251
- Four bucks.
- Four bucks?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.206
That's the rate.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.765
Fair enough.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.804
Oh, I almost forgot.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.210
I need these fixed, shoe man.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.204
OK. What do you want done?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.606
New soles.
And I need 'em tonight.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.925
We close at six.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.201
Close when I get my shoes.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.043
I'm just playing with you,
shoe man.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.080
See you at six.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.167
Right.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.251
You sure
you can't come today?

14:24.800 --> 14:28.646
<i>OK. Well, I'll see you
tomorrow. Thank you.</i>

15:14.520 --> 15:17.000
- Max?
- Yeah?

15:19.880 --> 15:21.211
What are you doing down here?

15:22.160 --> 15:25.004
Using this old stitcher.
Mine busted.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.809
Woo-hoo, look at this thing.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.531
Yeah. It's something, huh?

15:30.680 --> 15:33.729
My pop taught me how
to use this when I was little.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.766
It still works?

15:36.280 --> 15:39.090
Bit surprised,
but it's doing the trick.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.244
Right.
That shows you what I know.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.526
I was always telling your pop
he should sell this crap

15:45.680 --> 15:46.966
and make some money.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.243
But he could never
throw anything away.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.528
Yeah, except his family.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.285
He didn't
throw you away, Max.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.686
Hmm.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.363
Uh, my post
is up on the chair.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.089
Oh. All right,
I'll leave you the news.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.680
Hey, I'm going around the
corner for a beer. You wanna come?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.444
Nah, I've gotta wait
for a customer.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.367
Ah, good for you.
Keep 'em coming back.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.881
- Yes.
- Listen...

16:43.480 --> 16:46.006
...I picked up an extra jar
from the pickle guys.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.003
Oh, hey, thank you.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.766
- Ah. Good night, kid.
- Good night, Jimmy.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.724
What the hell was that?

18:48.280 --> 18:49.611
Oh, boy.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.451
Wow.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.731
What the hell?

20:48.520 --> 20:50.010
It's the stitcher.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.650
Wow.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.688
He's dead!
He's dead! He's dead!

21:40.080 --> 21:41.206
Whoa.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.609
I'm a woman.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.886
- Ooh! No I'm not.
- No I'm not.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.245
Ten and a half?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.086
Yeah.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.601
Nice.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.366
- Yep, that's them, great.
- All right.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.329
Sorry about losing
the ticket, pal.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.050
Don't worry. Everybody does.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.611
- I put tabs in the front and back.
- Beautiful. How much?

22:44.800 --> 22:46.245
That's 12 bucks.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.891
You got it.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.640
You look familiar.
Are you an actor or something.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.325
Uh, no, TV reporter.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.284
Yeah, that's right, uh,
from <i>New York One,</i>

22:57.440 --> 22:58.930
the guy with
the two first names.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.605
Yeah, Danny Donald.

23:00.760 --> 23:03.161
Danny Donald. Wow.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.364
My mother watches you
all the time.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.329
Yeah? That's great.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.771
You look like you
but you're a little different.

23:16.440 --> 23:19.125
You like that?
You like being on TV?

23:19.480 --> 23:22.324
It's great. I love going
to work, I'm a lucky guy.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.686
Yeah.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.321
Here. It's my card.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.880
Tell your mother
I said thanks for watching.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.169
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks again.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.290
Yeah, I will.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.006
- Hello.
- May I help you?

23:43.920 --> 23:46.127
Uh, what time
do you close?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.603
Six. It's on the door.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.327
OK.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.771
Do you want a haircut?

23:55.040 --> 23:57.281
No. I have to go now.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.921
OK.

24:02.760 --> 24:03.761
So go.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.201
Goodbye, Jimmy.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.525
It frickin' worked.
I can't believe it.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.161
He had no idea who I was.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.610
I could be anybody I want.

24:53.120 --> 24:57.045
This is great.
I'm gonna hang out in Chinatown.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.001
I have accent.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.130
I have accent!

25:29.120 --> 25:30.690
Ten and a half.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.364
Got some big feet there, kid.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.645
I'm big boned.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.210
Thank you very much.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.731
Where is the bathroom.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.281
Ah, yes, to your left
and downstairs.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.962
OK, thank you.

27:13.080 --> 27:16.527
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

27:16.680 --> 27:18.284
What size are your shoes?

27:19.840 --> 27:21.604
Wha...
Ten and a half. Why?

27:22.040 --> 27:23.530
Give me 'em.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.206
- What?
- Give me your shoes.

27:27.040 --> 27:30.601
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm real serious.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.126
I don't believe
this shit. I...

27:52.120 --> 27:53.246
Wow.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.091
Come on!

27:59.280 --> 28:00.850
Oh, yeah!

28:18.440 --> 28:19.487
Oh.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.001
Yeah, those are for you.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.645
Oh, so pretty.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.689
I knew you'd like them.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.924
How was your day, Maxie?

28:32.080 --> 28:34.890
It was good.
It was really good.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.361
It was the best day
I've had in a long time.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.130
Good. You work so hard.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.240
How was your day, Ma?

28:46.840 --> 28:50.606
I'm better,
now that my <i>tatala</i> is home.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.446
Yeah. Hey, Ma,
let me ask you something.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.886
You ever wish
you were somebody else?

28:58.720 --> 29:00.484
No.

29:00.720 --> 29:05.408
I'm your mother.
That's all I ever wanted to be.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.843
But if you could do

29:09.000 --> 29:13.244
whatever you wanted to do,
what would it be?

29:14.400 --> 29:15.890
Um...

29:21.720 --> 29:23.768
Have dinner with your father.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.085
That would be nice.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.323
That would be really nice.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.849
Hi.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.765
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.725
How are ya?

30:02.880 --> 30:04.689
- Good. How are you?
- Very good.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.729
Good. Emiliano wanted
me to drop these off.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.247
What does he want done?

30:09.520 --> 30:10.885
Whatever they need.

30:12.320 --> 30:15.369
Well...
It's a ten and a half.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.561
- I could clean 'em up for ya.
- OK.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.526
Mm. Looks like
they need new soles.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.330
Sounds good.

30:27.840 --> 30:28.921
Here you are.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.731
- Thank you.
- OK. Thank you.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.724
Hey, man.
What can we get ya?

31:22.880 --> 31:26.089
- I'll have a light beer.
- No light beer.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.527
Here is the beer list.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.086
Here is our cocktail list.
Why don't you check that out.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.765
What's a pickletini?

31:37.920 --> 31:40.685
Uh, it's vodka and pickle juice.
You want one?

31:40.840 --> 31:42.490
Sure, OK.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.005
You'll love it.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.491
Enjoy, buddy.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.607
Hi.

32:07.600 --> 32:08.681
Hi.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.566
- I know who you are.
- You do?

32:12.040 --> 32:14.486
Yeah. I saw you spin
at The Jane on New Years.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.165
You saw me spin?

32:16.640 --> 32:18.688
Isn't that what you call it?

32:19.600 --> 32:21.170
Anyway, I tried
to pick you up.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.680
Oh, yeah?
Did it work?

32:25.120 --> 32:27.600
No. You went home
with that model.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.405
You were all over each other.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.365
Oh, yeah,
that's my girlfriend.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.691
- It wasn't your girlfriend.
- Yeah, we live together.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.042
No, it definitely
wasn't your girlfriend.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.240
- Well, how do you know that?
- Because it was a guy.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.570
Wha...? A guy?
Are you kidding me?

32:43.720 --> 32:46.610
It's OK. I don't care.
I think it's hot.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.650
You... You do?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.325
Mm-hm.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.641
Huh.

33:01.120 --> 33:04.169
Hey. So, where are we going?

33:04.560 --> 33:06.642
I don't know.
Where do you live?

33:06.800 --> 33:08.928
Can't do that, love.
Boyfriend. Sorry.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.731
Oh. Oh. Uh, OK.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.730
Well, we could go to my place.
Just gotta make a call.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.400
Who are you calling?

33:16.800 --> 33:18.290
My mother.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.886
You... You live
with your mother.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.247
Yeah. And she gets
a little screwy at night

33:23.400 --> 33:24.890
so I don't want
to surprise her.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.244
Really?
Where do you live?

33:28.440 --> 33:29.680
Sheepshead Bay.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.850
Get home safe.

33:33.640 --> 33:37.486
My name is Bond, James Bond,

33:37.960 --> 33:41.282
and I live in Sheepshead Bay
with my mother.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.611
Oh, hey.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.123
- How's it going, mate.
- How are ya?

33:50.280 --> 33:52.089
- Beautiful night for it.
- Oh, yeah.

34:05.480 --> 34:06.527
Yeah?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.291
I forgot my keys.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.608
<i>You're a dork.
I'm about to take a shower.</i>

34:31.360 --> 34:32.440
Are you there?

34:33.639 --> 34:34.801
Yeah.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.045
Come here.

34:39.239 --> 34:40.730
You want me to come in?

34:41.800 --> 34:42.960
Yeah, come here.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.609
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.091
What the hell
are you wearing?

34:53.719 --> 34:54.766
You are beautiful.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.883
- Are you high?
- No, but I wish I was.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.561
Get over here.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.451
Oh, sure, OK.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.126
Thank you.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.249
Look, I'm sorry
I screamed at you before.

35:16.720 --> 35:17.926
It's just...

35:18.840 --> 35:21.320
I get scared. And I need
to know you want me here.

35:21.480 --> 35:25.087
Oh, I... I do.
I definitely do.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.683
Get in here, cute boy.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.241
Me? Really?
In there?

35:30.840 --> 35:32.649
- Well, yeah, really.
- With you?

35:32.800 --> 35:34.086
Your friends can wait.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.642
Oh, yeah, yep.

35:36.920 --> 35:41.482
Yeah, definitely.
They can wait.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.049
My friends can wait.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.204
What?

35:52.120 --> 35:53.406
I can't do this.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.684
- I've gotta go.
- Are you serious?

35:55.880 --> 35:58.121
Yeah, I know,
but I'm really sorry.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.489
Why are you acting
like such a spaz?

36:01.640 --> 36:03.768
Oh, I'm not, I just...
Is this thing locked?

36:03.920 --> 36:05.920
- What's the matter with you?
- I've got it, right.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.326
- What are you doing?
- I've gotta go.

36:07.480 --> 36:11.121
I'm really sorry.
Um... Bye.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.486
Emiliano?

36:12.720 --> 36:14.768
Emiliano, come back!

36:15.680 --> 36:17.125
Emiliano!

36:19.720 --> 36:20.960
<i>I'm here
on the Lower East Side</i>

36:21.080 --> 36:23.048
<i>for the Grand Street
Housing protest</i>

36:23.240 --> 36:24.730
<i>- and we're here
with Mr. Leonard Soloman...</i>

36:24.880 --> 36:27.804
- Ma? Ma? Ma?
<i>- ...who's our last holdout.</i>

36:27.960 --> 36:30.247
<i>You refuse to go.
Can I ask why?</i>

36:30.680 --> 36:33.729
<i>- I stay here until I die.</i>
- That's Danny Donald.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.160
<i>- You're not gonna be
pushed around, I see.</i>

36:35.320 --> 36:38.005
He came by the shop the other
day. I meant to tell you.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.446
How's work?

36:40.360 --> 36:43.603
Work? Work was something.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.330
<i>Hi, I'm Carmen Herrara
from the Lower East side.</i>

36:45.440 --> 36:46.487
And it's Carmen.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.449
<i>And I too have lived here
all of my life.</i>

36:48.640 --> 36:50.085
She was in the shop too.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.840
<i>...to stay here
and raise my family here,</i>

36:51.880 --> 36:52.927
<i>and not be kicked out.</i>

36:53.040 --> 36:54.724
<i>If people want to come
out and support your cause...</i>

36:54.800 --> 36:55.801
How about that.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.365
<i>We're called the Lower East
Side Action Committee.</i>

36:57.520 --> 36:59.840
<i>Please come by and get involved.
We would love to have you.</i>

37:00.240 --> 37:02.686
<i>- Thank you. Good luck.
- Thank you.</i>

37:02.840 --> 37:06.162
<i>I'm Danny Donald from the Lower
East Side for New York One.</i>

37:06.320 --> 37:09.005
- I like him.
- Yeah, me too.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.481
Who's Carmen?

37:19.080 --> 37:20.206
Max?

37:22.200 --> 37:25.124
Hi. Hi. How's it going?

37:25.600 --> 37:27.523
Good.
You left your door open.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.849
Can you shut that
for me please?

37:31.080 --> 37:32.969
- Sure.
- Thanks.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.131
I'm delivering groceries
to one of our elderly neighbors.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.046
- All by yourself?
- Yeah, Max, I'm a badass.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.009
Yeah. OK.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.640
So you like pickles, huh?

37:46.680 --> 37:48.921
- Yeah. Do you?
- No, not really.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.849
But I'm glad that you're
supporting a local business.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.411
That's cool.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.890
Oh, um, we need more names
for our petition.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.321
Do you think you could
get your dad to sign?

37:59.400 --> 38:02.483
- Nah.
- Max, this is important.

38:02.640 --> 38:06.804
I know. My, uh, father
took off a while ago.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.405
He ain't around anymore.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.923
- I'm sorry.
- It hurts.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.766
Yeah, it does. My dad split
when I was 12. Life goes on.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.120
Yeah, right.

38:19.320 --> 38:21.480
Yeah. I've gotta deliver these.
I'll see you soon, Max.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.641
OK.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.281
Come by the office.
Get involved.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.964
Yeah, OK.

39:49.480 --> 39:50.720
Hey, Pop.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.490
There you are.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.371
Ma?

40:21.640 --> 40:22.721
Wow.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.200
You look beautiful.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.204
Come on, it's time.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.970
OK, my love.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.286
Avram?

40:55.160 --> 40:56.241
Hello Sarah.

41:09.640 --> 41:12.803
Of course I'm home.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.849
I missed you so much.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.365
I'm here now.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.645
But where did you go?

41:31.560 --> 41:32.686
I went for pears.

41:32.880 --> 41:35.486
Remember?

41:37.400 --> 41:39.164
Yes, of course.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.444
I'm so glad you're home.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.410
Me too.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.011
Goodbye, Pop.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.611
Goodbye, son.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.764
Ma, you overslept?

43:42.280 --> 43:43.884
Is that what happens
when you have a big date?

43:44.040 --> 43:45.644
Ma?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.286
Ma?

43:59.640 --> 44:00.846
Ma?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.001
Ma?

44:08.440 --> 44:09.680
Ma.

44:10.320 --> 44:11.810
Oh, Ma.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.368
Oh, no.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.846
Max, Max, you should start
saving for a nice headstone.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.606
She deserves a nice headstone,
your mother.

44:32.360 --> 44:34.488
They're not cheap, Max.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.891
Oh, it's good of you to come.
Thank you.

44:47.120 --> 44:50.044
How you doing, kid.
You're gonna freeze out here.

44:50.200 --> 44:51.725
I'm all right.

44:53.800 --> 44:57.202
Hey, this was really nice,
what you did.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.485
She'd have liked it.

45:03.720 --> 45:05.563
You were a good son
to her, Max.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.727
Look, Max, if your dad
was here right now...

45:13.880 --> 45:15.120
But he's not here.

45:18.520 --> 45:21.285
I was all she had,
I wasn't good enough.

45:22.640 --> 45:23.846
Of course you were.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.367
You don't know the half
of it, Jimmy.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.804
Can't even afford
a decent headstone.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.690
I could help out, kid.
You know that.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.411
Why? What have I
ever done for you?

45:36.560 --> 45:38.562
What have I ever done
for anybody?

45:41.880 --> 45:45.327
Look, you're hurting right now
but don't beat yourself up, OK?

45:46.000 --> 45:47.843
I'm gonna go
back inside, Jimmy.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.082
Thanks for coming.

45:50.680 --> 45:51.920
Max...

45:52.960 --> 45:54.564
...I promise,
it's gonna get better.

45:54.720 --> 45:56.131
Just give it time.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.849
Don't do anything
you'll regret.

45:59.560 --> 46:00.891
It's a little late
for that.

46:08.040 --> 46:11.601
<i>Yo, shoe man? Shoe man?</i>

46:12.800 --> 46:14.643
Yes.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.365
Yo, where you been, man?

46:19.200 --> 46:20.565
I've been back and forth
to this shop all week

46:20.720 --> 46:21.960
waiting on your punk ass.

46:22.240 --> 46:25.687
I'm sorry.
I was sitting <i>shiva.</i>

46:25.880 --> 46:27.644
Where they do that at?

46:27.840 --> 46:31.481
It's a Jewish ritual,
when somebody dies.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.126
You Jewish?

46:34.640 --> 46:35.641
Yeah.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.086
Lucky you.

46:37.240 --> 46:40.289
- So who croaked, man?
- What?

46:40.800 --> 46:42.723
Who died or are you just
making some shit up.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.731
My mother.

46:48.720 --> 46:51.326
Oh, man.
I'm sorry to hear that.

46:52.200 --> 46:53.645
She leave you
any money, man?

46:54.800 --> 46:57.121
No, right? Figures.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.691
Ain't that
just like a woman?

47:01.720 --> 47:03.165
Do you have your ticket?

47:03.520 --> 47:05.170
Do I look like
I got my ticket, man?

47:06.160 --> 47:07.525
Just go back there and get my
shoes

47:07.680 --> 47:09.091
before I kick some skin
off your forehead.

47:09.240 --> 47:10.969
Know how much
them gators cost?

47:11.640 --> 47:13.881
No, I don't.
But you need your ticket.

47:17.560 --> 47:20.689
New rule, shoe man,
you find my shoes by tomorrow

47:20.840 --> 47:24.481
or you're gonna be reunited with
your mom real quick, got that?

47:25.600 --> 47:26.806
I got it.

47:45.760 --> 47:46.886
Hey, Mommy.
Want another baby daddy?

47:47.040 --> 47:48.804
Jerk.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.884
Yo, fatty at a party,
what are you looking at, man?

49:09.200 --> 49:11.123
Ain't no
box of Twinkies, yo.

49:14.400 --> 49:15.845
Take the stairs.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.331
Hello?

50:03.720 --> 50:05.961
Jesus!
What are you doing here?

50:06.120 --> 50:07.645
I'm... I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

50:07.800 --> 50:09.643
- I thought you left.
- What?

50:09.800 --> 50:11.529
Why are you back?

50:12.800 --> 50:15.121
Oh, um... I forgot something.

50:15.320 --> 50:16.970
Oh, yeah? What you forgot?

50:17.120 --> 50:19.600
- You forgot to hit me again?
- No.

50:19.920 --> 50:22.002
Yeah, well, I'm taking
my shit and I'm leaving.

50:22.200 --> 50:23.201
OK.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.164
Do you know where my watches
are, by any chance?

50:27.320 --> 50:29.004
I didn't touch
your stupid watches.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.481
I was just asking
where they were.

50:31.640 --> 50:33.085
I have no idea, but if I did,

50:33.240 --> 50:34.720
I'd take them and I'd
sell them shits.

50:34.800 --> 50:36.450
You took my money, Leon,
and you know it.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.284
I worked my ass off
and you just took it.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.091
- Let me get that for you.
- Don't... Don't touch my stuff.

50:41.240 --> 50:42.844
I was just trying to help.

50:43.240 --> 50:47.564
Leon, one day you're gonna get
yours. You're gonna get yours.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.485
Go to hell.

50:56.960 --> 50:58.644
Man, this guy's a jerk.

51:08.800 --> 51:12.964
Come on.

51:37.640 --> 51:39.165
What the crap?

51:39.480 --> 51:40.891
What the crap?

51:44.680 --> 51:46.523
Oh my.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.290
What is that?

52:27.360 --> 52:28.850
- What the...?
- Hey.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.929
I don't know who you are
but you're dead.

53:11.880 --> 53:13.530
Hi.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.160
It's no use. I tied you down
pretty good.

53:20.920 --> 53:23.207
Just tell me where you hide
your watches and I'll split.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.965
Finished?

53:31.040 --> 53:35.204
Look, I don't want to hurt you.
I'm not a bad person.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.121
I just got to take care
of some things

53:37.280 --> 53:38.611
and do right by my mother.

53:39.160 --> 53:40.366
OK?

53:44.680 --> 53:46.682
I don't know who put you
up to this, fat boy,

53:46.840 --> 53:49.286
but I'm gonna cut a slab
of bacon off your back...

53:51.240 --> 53:52.401
That's rude.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.564
And I'm not fat.
I am big-boned.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.371
Oh, Well.

53:59.360 --> 54:00.725
Suit yourself.

54:01.720 --> 54:03.245
But you'll be sorry.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.729
I heard somebody's
not cooperating.

54:22.720 --> 54:24.165
You done?

54:24.600 --> 54:27.331
I'm gonna make this easy.
The watches.

54:28.520 --> 54:31.729
You gotta know, you can't hide
looking the way you do.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.803
I'm gonna take my chances.
The watches.

54:37.760 --> 54:39.683
There's a fake wall
behind the bathroom mirror.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.280
<i>So, here's how
we're gonna do this.</i>

54:42.360 --> 54:45.045
<i>I'm gonna take your watches,
tase you</i>

54:45.200 --> 54:47.965
<i>and you're gonna wake up in
your bed like it's a bad dream.</i>

54:48.880 --> 54:51.087
Wowee.

54:52.840 --> 54:54.251
That was a great hiding spot.

54:54.720 --> 54:57.530
OK, you ready?

54:59.440 --> 55:01.807
Be careful with that, man.

55:01.960 --> 55:04.645
That's not a regular Taser.
That's weapons-grade shit.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.880
I'm sorry, man, I have to do
this. It's the only way.

55:08.160 --> 55:09.650
<i>- Yo, boss?</i>
- Yo...!

55:16.440 --> 55:18.044
Oh, crap.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.560
You scream, and I will tase you

55:25.720 --> 55:28.007
and throw you out the back
window, you got that?

55:28.920 --> 55:30.490
Now, who is that?

55:31.440 --> 55:34.125
It's my boys.
We got business.

55:34.640 --> 55:38.645
When they see you, they're gonna
just about break you in half.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.165
What kind of business?

55:40.320 --> 55:41.606
Gotta pick up my money, bitch.

55:41.760 --> 55:43.762
- How much money?
- What the hell is it to you?

55:45.080 --> 55:46.445
Fifty large.

55:47.320 --> 55:48.810
Fifty thousand dollars?

56:00.840 --> 56:02.444
Hey, boss.

56:03.040 --> 56:04.121
Hey.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.210
New coat?

56:06.720 --> 56:07.926
Yeah.

56:08.640 --> 56:10.449
Let's go.

56:20.960 --> 56:24.043
Gotta make a quick stop, boss.
Got a little surprise for you.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.004
I just wanna
pick up my money.

56:28.160 --> 56:31.369
It's on the way.
You're gonna like this.

57:12.600 --> 57:13.840
Hey, boss.

57:14.280 --> 57:16.169
Remember our old friend,
Patrick?

57:16.440 --> 57:17.566
Patrick the rat prick.

57:18.680 --> 57:20.523
I didn't know
it was you, Leon.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.162
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

57:23.320 --> 57:24.765
We found rat prick
down in Philly.

57:24.960 --> 57:25.961
Bitch tried to run.

57:26.760 --> 57:29.889
No more.
No more, please, please.

57:30.040 --> 57:33.442
No more. OK. OK.

57:36.320 --> 57:37.560
Bye-bye, rat prick.

57:37.760 --> 57:39.524
No! Don't! Hold on, stop! Stop!

57:39.720 --> 57:41.006
Stop!

57:42.240 --> 57:44.891
OK, boss.
What do you want to do?

57:46.240 --> 57:48.925
I don't know. Uh...
I've got to think about this.

57:49.400 --> 57:50.925
Is there a bathroom
around here?

57:52.200 --> 57:53.486
What?

57:53.640 --> 57:54.641
I gotta pee.

57:54.800 --> 57:57.929
Oh, man. Man, oh,
man, oh, man. Oh, man, oh, man.

57:58.080 --> 58:01.163
You should not be here.
You should not be here.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.448
You should not be here.

58:07.200 --> 58:08.326
You can do this.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.808
You sorry for what you did,
rat prick?

58:23.160 --> 58:24.161
Yeah.

58:24.520 --> 58:26.602
And you're never
gonna do it again?

58:29.240 --> 58:30.401
No.

58:31.080 --> 58:33.208
OK, I believe you.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.048
You believe me? You be...
He believes me.

58:37.400 --> 58:39.209
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

58:40.160 --> 58:42.447
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

58:42.920 --> 58:44.922
Maybe take him to the hospital,
he's in bad shape.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.281
Boss, he stole from us.

58:46.640 --> 58:49.166
I know! The guy apologized!

58:50.080 --> 58:53.243
Just do what I said!
I'm the boss, right?

58:54.600 --> 58:57.171
Thank you! Thanks a lot!

59:32.280 --> 59:34.851
Leon, follow me.
You stay here.

59:44.520 --> 59:46.204
Good evening, Mr. Ludlow.

59:47.720 --> 59:51.850
I am making duck ragu. First
time, very tricky business.

59:52.240 --> 59:54.004
Do you like duck, Leon?

59:55.360 --> 59:57.567
- I don't know.
- Yeah, me neither.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.085
I'm a Jew from Queens.
What do I know from duck?

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.125
Are you OK, Leon?

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.729
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.963
Good. I am ready to move forward
on the Grand Street deal.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.488
I will need the trash
taken out before Friday.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.120
You get the rest
when the job is done.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.486
OK.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.491
There is no margin for error
on this one, none.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.008
<i>None.</i> You got it?

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.969
Yeah, I got it.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.603
Maybe you'll stop by
for some duck ragu

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.125
when you're through.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.166
Holy crap.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.286
OK, Ludlow, it's time.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.281
Welcome home, Mommy.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.330
Turn around.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.722
- So where are your friends at, huh?
- What?

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.440
The fat kid,
the guy that looks like me.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.681
No, it's just me.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.920
Damn, you ugly.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.283
And what have we here, hmm?

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.960
Thought you were gonna
steal my watches, huh?

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.890
Please, don't shoot me.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.169
Oh, don't worry, I ain't
gonna shoot you, she-man.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.880
I am gonna
choke you to death.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.931
- Shoe man!
- Hey.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.686
No.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.166
No, no.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.243
Oh, my God. What the crap?

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.210
What the crap?

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.085
Oh.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.971
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.608
- Hey.
- Yeah, what do you need?

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.484
I'd like to report a crime.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.486
What kind of crime?

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.610
Murder. I killed a man
but by accident.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.926
Why don't you have a seat?

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.405
You unlawfully entered
the alleged victim's house?

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.608
Yes. His girlfriend let me in.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.649
His ex-girlfriend.
They broke up.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.962
I think he was hitting her.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.090
So why did she
let you in?

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.720
Because I looked
just like him.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.002
But you don't
look like him now?

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.324
No, not at all, he's black.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.971
And you said that you killed him

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.091
with a... stiletto heal.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.323
Yes, that's right, six inch
platform, molded plastic,

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.488
but with metal tube
reinforcement.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.123
Not great quality but it did
the trick, unfortunately.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.051
Right. Right.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.211
The body is just right
in the living room.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.444
You might wanna
stay out here. It's...

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.844
It's pretty ugly in there.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.686
What the hell?

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.050
The body was right here.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.926
There was blood everywhere.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.409
He was dead, I swear.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.324
Wh... Where are my shoes?

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.565
There was a blue bag here
with my shoes in it

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.210
and 50 thousand dollars cash!

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.567
A... And a gun.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.647
And my Taser.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.487
Where's my Taser?
It's all gone.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.251
In fact, there was a whole cache
of guns! What the hell?

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.970
There's something screwy
going on.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.724
We need to get
some leads or something.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.006
Yeah.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.566
Yeah.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.525
I'm telling ya, he's dead.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.484
I... I killed him.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.085
Guys, I mean, should we question
the super? Maybe he knows.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.765
Sir, let go of the door.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.241
But...

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.209
I'm telling you the truth!

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.010
You gotta be kidding me.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.608
What the crap is going on?

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.651
How do you stop this?

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.046
- Max.
- Hey, Jimmy.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.804
You leaving?
You just got here?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.843
Yeah, I've gotta go
take care of something.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.844
It's peak hours.
What's so important?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.365
Don't worry about it.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.367
What are you doing?

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.806
I'm worried, OK.
What's going on?

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.765
One second. What?

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.126
You've been running around
half-cocked

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.480
since your mother passed away.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.125
Will you just be
straight with me?

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.885
All right, look, I took some
money that doesn't belong to me

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.929
and I'm gonna
go give it back, all right?

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.490
No. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa! Whoa!

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.802
Damn it, Jimmy.
Why'd you do that?

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.200
'Cause I'm trying to stop you
from screwing up your life.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.201
Your shop's closed half the
time, you're acting all crazy.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.120
I'm not blind, Max, I know where
this is going, I've seen it before.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.767
You have not
seen this before, trust me.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.566
Oh, yes I have and you know
with who? Your father.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.563
- My father?
- Yeah.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.331
He was acting just like
you are before he took off.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.401
What are you saying?

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.363
Listen, your old man,
he got into some trouble

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.040
with some bad people
and he had to disappear,

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.931
had to make them think that he
was dead and never coming back

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.128
or else they were gonna
hurt you, hurt your mother.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.645
You knew this all this time
and you didn't tell me?

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.484
How come you didn't tell me?

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.000
He made me
promise not to.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.041
He what?

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:31.402
He said that I was
the only one he could trust.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.082
What... the hell
are you doing, kid?

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.207
New rules, Jimmy!

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.319
You stay out of my business,
you hear me?

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.481
Max, I just don't want you
to make the same mistakes

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.091
your old man did.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.251
Maxie? Max!

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.609
Mrs. Greenawalt, I got someone
out here who wants to see you.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.241
Who is it?

01:08:56.439 --> 01:08:58.169
You gotta see
for yourself.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.279
Hello, Greenawalt.

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:09.361
Hello.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.520
Ludlow sent me
to give you this.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.207
And, um, what is it?

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.765
Your money.
He can't take out the trash.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.720
He can't?

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.322
No, he can't. He's sorry.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.127
OK.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.523
And your name is?

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.081
I'm Marsha.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.407
And, uh,
where is Leon, Marsha?

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.207
- I don't know.
- I don't believe you.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.846
You see, um, Leon left me,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.129
well, and you, in a very
difficult situation here.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.600
If we don't get this little
matter cleaned up

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.842
I stand to lose an enormous
amount of money

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.247
and I don't like
losing money.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.081
You don't have enough?

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.685
No, I don't.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.168
Thank you for bringing back
my money.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.891
Brian will give you
your receipt now. Brian?

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.771
- You hungry?
- No.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.200
You mind if we stop
to get some food?

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.085
Yeah, I mind, Brian.
I'm kind of busy right now.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.720
I'm starving, Jeffrey.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.800
Well, you should have
thought of that before we left.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.721
I wasn't hungry then.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.440
We'll get something to eat
after we get rid of our friend.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.767
We need to talk
about Grand Street anyway.

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.125
Yeah, we torching the place?

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.441
Yeah, tomorrow night.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.561
You smell something?

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.485
I thought that was you.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.646
No, it's not me, Jeffrey.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.569
Maybe princess
pissed herself.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.841
Hey, mister, you OK?

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.286
Huh?

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.844
Don't eat me!
Please, don't eat me!

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.286
All right. All right.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.609
I'm not!
I'm not gonna eat you!

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.281
Kid?

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.205
Kid, Wake up!

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.242
I'm not gonna eat you!
Kid! Kid!

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.171
Hey. There he is.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.846
You finished?

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.724
Yup, just in time.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.610
- You feeling better?
- Yeah.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.763
I'm sorry
about the way I acted.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.605
Oh, don't worry
about it, Max.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.163
I should've told you
about your father sooner.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.731
I'm sorry.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.766
You're a good friend,
Jimmy, to him and to me.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.006
How about a pickle?

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.925
Yeah, thanks.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.563
Why don't you let me
give you a shave.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.851
I think I'll stick
with the pickle.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.527
Oh, crap.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.285
<i>Mr. Solomon
is a wonderful old man</i>

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.487
<i>who lives on Grand Street</i>

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.680
<i>and they're trying to evict him
from his apartment.</i>

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.163
<i>I will need the
trash taken out before Friday.</i>

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.120
<i>We're torching
the place?</i>

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.924
<i>Yeah, tomorrow night.</i>

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.164
<i>I stay here until I die.</i>

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.886
Max?

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.646
Hey. I think I'm ready
to get involved.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.765
How did you hear
all of this?

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.410
I heard it. I...

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.768
Look, I have a special ability

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.167
to see and hear stuff
I shouldn't.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.640
Max, I really need
to get back to the office.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.400
I know it sounds crazy
but I'm not crazy.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.527
You've got to believe me.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.290
Max, I'm gonna ask you this
one time

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.169
And I want you
to tell me the truth.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.687
Are you making this all up
just to get with me?

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.241
What? No. I swear.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.449
I do think you're very pretty
but I'm telling you the truth.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.126
OK, so who are these people?
Do you know any names?

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.690
The woman's name is Greenawalt.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.365
Elaine Greenawalt?

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.885
Yeah, that's...
You know her?

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.520
Yeah. Her company owns
Mr. Solomon's building.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.851
She's got a pretty nice
place upstate too.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.410
You went to her house?

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.565
<i>This is the building.</i>

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.722
<i>Once he's gone, they can
sell the whole block.</i>

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.927
<i>It's worth a fortune.</i>

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.042
<i>Wow. You really think
you can stop them?</i>

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.320
<i>Of course I do.
I told you, Max, I'm a badass.</i>

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.771
<i>Oh, yeah, that's right.</i>

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.680
<i>Come on, he lives
on the third floor.</i>

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.165
<i>He's the last one left.</i>

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.529
See? Everyone's gone.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.722
- Hello, Carmen.
- Hi, Mr. Solomon.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.120
This is my friend, Max

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.368
and we need to talk to you
about something.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.931
Oh, come.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.761
How are you?

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.127
These men, they said
they want to kill me?

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.407
They said they would burn
your building down

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.244
with you
in it, so, yeah.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.047
You believe him?

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.404
Yeah, I do.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.086
Hm.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.841
Thank you very much for telling
me this, but I can't leave.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.811
Are you kidding me?

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.680
These are bad people,
Mr. Solomon,

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.330
they're not
messing around.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.247
Max, my wife and I lived
in this apartment 45 years,

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.051
I raised
my daughter here, Sonya.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.842
I cannot run away.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.807
Mr. Solomon, where does
your daughter live now?

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.481
Chicago.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.047
Can I ask you
a personal question?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.326
Mm.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.325
What size are your shoes?

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.287
Mr. Solomon, I'm Elaine
Greenawalt.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.205
It's nice
to finally meet you.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.328
I want to make a deal.
I'm ready to leave.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.006
How much?

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.247
One hundred
thousand dollars cash

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.846
and a bus ticket
to Chicago.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.286
How soon
can you be ready?

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.841
Tomorrow.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.167
OK.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.165
Brian here will escort you
to Chicago.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.725
Uh-uh. I don't need escort.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.123
I want to see that you get
there safely.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.123
Do we have a deal,
Mr. Solomon?

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.810
- A deal.
- Good.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:00.970
Ah. Come in
but take off shoes.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.686
You're wearing yours.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.727
It's my house.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.530
Well, come on,
quit stalling, old man.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.760
Then you don't
come inside.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.921
Take off.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.806
Just do it.
Let's get this over with.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.644
It's all there, pal,
100 grand.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.366
This is all you're bringing?

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.960
What about the rest
of this crap?

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.649
I leave it all behind,
start new life.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.484
Where the hell
are our shoes?

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.322
Oh, bad crime.
That's why I'm leaving.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.084
What, you think
you're funny, asshole?

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.646
Forget the shoes, Brian.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.086
What do you mean,
forget the shoes?

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:53.971
- It's freezing out, Jeffrey.
- We'll pick up some new ones.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.280
Mrs. Greenawalt.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.970
<i>Yeah, is he gone?</i>

01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.929
- They're on the bus.
<i>- Good</i>

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.161
Now get over to Solomon's.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.486
I want you to sweep the
entire building

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.881
and wait outside
until morning, clear?

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.530
Yes, ma 'am.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.126
What the...?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.286
Ludlow?

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.485
I don't believe this asshole.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.127
Brian?

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.800
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.006
Behind you!

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.691
I love this thing.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.443
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Any problems?

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.523
<i>- No.</i>
- Good. I'm ten minutes away.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.081
I'm meeting Mr. Tam in front
of the building.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:43.848
OK. I'm parked right out front.
I'll wait here.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.809
Good idea.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.447
Idiot.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.204
Thanks for the phone, handsome.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.649
Where the hell
is this idiot?

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.531
Call Jeffrey.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.200
What are you doing?
That's private property.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.770
- I'm visiting a friend.
- Who?

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.007
Leonard Solomon.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.849
He doesn't live here
anymore, he moved.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.288
Really?
Somebody should tell him that.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.010
Oh, and by the way...

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.769
Oh, no.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.840
Sir, can you step
over here please?

01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.570
Do you have a weapon
on you, sir?

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.210
Wait, wait, I didn't do...

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.207
Wait, wait! Hey, Solomon.
Solomon, stop! Solomon!

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.044
- No.
- Hello.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.605
You're on the bus to Chicago.
I just talked to Brian.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.847
He lied.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.489
That's impossible.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.251
No, not really.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.488
I just gave him some of
the money that you gave to me.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.764
What kind of game are you trying
to play here, Mr. Solomon?

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.242
- You and I had a deal.
- No game.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.769
This is my home.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.606
I'm not leaving.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.805
OK, let me tell you
how this is gonna work.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.164
If you don't get up
and walk out of here right now,

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.164
I am going to burn this whole
place to the ground,

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.891
And then I'm gonna
send someone to Chicago

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:01.728
to find your daughter and throw
her off the Sears Tower tonight.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.882
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.369
That's very clear.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.521
And that is good
for the television.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.844
- For the television?
Uh-huh.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.924
What are you talking about,
you senile old man?

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.006
<i>New York One.</i>

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.331
Hello, Mrs. Greenawalt.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.249
- Danny Donald, <i>New York One.</i>
- You're who?

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.402
You know,
that's Danny Donald.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.883
Care to tell me
what you're doing here?

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.487
What am I doing here?

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.404
We heard you threaten to
kill Mr. Solomon

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.403
and threaten to kill his
daughter in Chicago.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.881
I'm not in Chicago.
I didn't say that.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.520
No? Oh, because we have it
all on tape.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.643
I could play it back
for you right now. Live.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:46.488
I did not give consent to being
filmed for television right now.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.847
You set this up
and I will make you pay.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.480
Maybe they got duck ragu
in prison.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.930
You son of a bitch!

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.484
Hi.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.243
I came to get
Emiliano's shoes.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.485
Oh, yeah.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.164
- Uh, new soles.
- Perfect.

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.769
He's gonna be happy.
He wanted to wear them tonight.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.684
Oh, yeah? Going out
on a big date?

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.366
No, it's boy's night.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.808
Huh. No charge.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.211
Really? That's really sweet.
Thank you.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.045
Thank you.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.082
- Hi, Max.
- Hi, Carmen.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.565
My favorite boots.

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.042
I busted the zipper and I
thought they were goners

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.283
and then I remembered
that I knew a badass cobbler.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.322
Ah, well,
these are good shoes.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.331
I could do something
with these.

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.441
Yeah, work your magic.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.843
So I talked to Mr. Solomon
this morning.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.411
Oh, yeah?
How's he doing?

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.450
He said he's having a wonderful
time and that when he comes home

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.329
he wants
to thank you in person.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.965
Oh, well, OK.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.971
How'd you pull it off, Max?

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.730
Pull what off?

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:32.051
Solomon, Greenawalt,
all of it.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.531
Here's your ticket.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.329
- Thanks.
- Don't lose it.

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.889
So do you have plans
next Friday night?

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.322
No, why?
You having another rally?

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.928
No. I would like
to have dinner with you.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.049
Would you like to have dinner
with me, Max?

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.171
Yeah, sure, yeah.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.806
Got a pen?

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.691
Here's my number.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.121
Don't lose it.

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.126
I won't.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.966
Good.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.606
Bye, Max.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.165
Bye, Carmen.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.241
- Shit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.640
I'm not here to hurt you.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.325
Bullshit. Leave me alone.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.961
Wait, I'm not staying.
I just wanted to give you these.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.920
Take 'em.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.411
You're giving me
your watches?

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.924
Sell 'em.
They're worth a lot.

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.646
Why are you doing this?

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.724
I'm sorry for what I did.
You deserve better.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.686
Much better.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.686
Hey, man,
you got a light?

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.484
- No.
- I do.

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.487
Let's go.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:19.045
- Hello, Leon. Remember me?
- Rat prick?

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.960
My name is Patrick,
you piece of shit, Patrick.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.360
Time for some payback.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.363
OK, hold up,
just let me take my shoe off...

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.364
Don't worry about your shoes.
You're not gonna need them.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.331
- But I let you go.
- Well, we all make mistakes.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.006
You look like crap,
by the way. Let's go.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.446
You smell like crap too.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.329
You been rolling around
in the garbage, Leon, hmm?

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.640
Well, you should've stayed...

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:39.960
Hey, look out!

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.811
Where am I?

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.771
You're in my shop.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.365
How did I get here?

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.683
Here. Drink.

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.686
You took quite a knock.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.291
What happened, Jimmy?

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.604
You were in a car accident.
I found you, pulled you out.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.171
Have a pickle.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.091
No, I'm good.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.126
Just take one.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.886
I don't want a pickle.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.724
I don't care if you want one,
you need it.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.406
Just take one.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.403
What are you talking about,
I need it?

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.320
Pickles preserve you
when you change, Max.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.771
They give you strength.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.726
Otherwise, you get all screwed
up, jumping from body to body.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.128
- You know?
- Of course I know.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.529
Who do you think got rid
of that putz, Ludlow?

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.282
That stiletto heel
made quite a mess, kid.

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.090
That was you? How?

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.608
You see, the thing is,
I'm not just a barber, Max.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.171
I'm also a cobbler.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.120
And...

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.965
I'm your father.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.291
- Pop?
- That's right, Max.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.091
- But you're...
- No, I'm right here.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:22.801
Ah.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.726
- Hold it.
- What?

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.291
You were right next door
to me the whole time

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.805
and you didn't tell me?

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.961
I wanted to tell you.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.561
Yeah, but you should've.
I was all alone.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.324
And Ma, Ma never knew.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.130
She thought you were dead
or something.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:43.204
I felt like I was dead, all that
time on the outside looking in.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.367
Because you left us.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.726
No, because I didn't have
a choice, Max.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.082
- You had a choice.
- Will you try to understand?

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.049
No! I don't understand!

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.204
I don't understand.
I don't understand any of this!

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.124
Maxie, I wanted to tell you
so many times

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.089
but it was
too dangerous.

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.961
If it was so dangerous
why are you telling me now, huh?

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.329
Because it's time,
it's time you knew the truth.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.691
You're ready.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.927
- I'm ready?
- That's right, son.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.606
For what?
What are you talking about?

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.811
Come to the basement, Max.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.884
You need to see something.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.606
See what?

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.520
Your birthright.

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.405
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.607
As my father's shoes worked
for me, mine will work for you.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.763
Who are all these people?

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.402
Customers. They help us
to help others.

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.326
They're all labelled.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.491
Derek Jeter?

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.726
That one was for me.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:05.369
- Pop, you made all these shoes?
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.602
These shoes go
all the way back

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:10.047
to your great-grandfather
Pinchas.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.364
He passed them on
to my father Herschel,

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.763
Just as I'm passing it
on to you.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.648
It's a privilege to walk
in another man's shoes, Max,

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.371
but it's also
a responsibility.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.284
I think you've
learned that by now.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.921
You are a guardian
of soles, Max.

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.846
You are the cobbler.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.205
This is your thing.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.122
I missed you, Max,
I really missed you.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.160
Pop...

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:47.960
I'm...

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.561
Listen to me, I'm sorry.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.922
I'm sorry about Ma.
I didn't mean...

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.570
- Oh.
- I didn't know.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.721
I'm the one who left,
I made the mistakes.

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:03.321
And you...

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.571
...you did right by her.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.848
By me. You did right.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.128
Ah.
It's been a long day.

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:24.328
What do you say we
close up shop and go home.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.331
Yeah, let's go home.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:34.048
Son, I can't go out the front,
not like this.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.486
Let's go out
the back.

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.291
What back?

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.166
This back.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.446
Wow.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.166
I don't believe it.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.688
Believe it.
It beats the subway.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.488
Pop, this is yours?

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:55.168
Ours. Webb,
this is my son, Max.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.488
- Nice to meet you, Max.
- Hi, Webb.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.080
Webb, we're heading home
to Brooklyn.

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:03.241
- Very good, sir.
- Did Jimmy have this place?

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.484
No, no, no, no, I put this in
after I bought Jimmy out.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:10.442
- Where is he?
- The Caribbean. He sends his regards.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.490
You know, barbers have always
been very trusted friends to us.

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:16.483
We never have
to worry about 'em.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.848
Oh, who do we have
to worry about?

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.970
- Dry cleaners.
- Dry cleaners, really?

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.726
They're not nice fellas
and they're very powerful.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.401
Wow.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.881
Well, uh...

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.206
So, Pop, you mean,
we're not the only ones?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.729
<i>No, no, no.</i>

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.769
<i>There's plenty of tradesmen
like us out there,</i>

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.729
<i>some good, some bad.</i>

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.885
<i>And it's been that way
for centuries.</i>

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.050
<i>Tomorrow, we'll sit down
with the stitcher</i>

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.651
<i>and I'll show you everything.</i>

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:48.203
<i>Aw, man, that thing is
great, Pop. Where did we get it?</i>

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.284
<i>The stitcher? Oh, that's
a good story, actually.</i>

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.651
<i>A long time ago, on the coldest
of winter nights,</i>

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:59.049
<i>a vagrant came knocking
at the door of our shop.</i>

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.248
<i>Your great-great-grandfather
gave him shelter</i>

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.448
<i>when no one else would.</i>

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.080
<i>He fed the man,
mended his shoes...</i>
