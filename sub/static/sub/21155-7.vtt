WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.617
- Previously on "Killjoys"...

00:03.129 --> 00:05.586
— This isn't her ship.
It's her prison.

00:05.590 --> 00:06.796
— Aneela's abilities
with the Green

00:06.799 --> 00:08.414
are unlike anyone else's.

00:08.426 --> 00:10.542
We watch her.
We learn from her.

00:11.471 --> 00:13.382
The Hullen have existed
for thousands of years.

00:13.389 --> 00:15.471
Did you really think the power
structure ended with Aneela?

00:15.475 --> 00:17.136
Agh!

00:17.143 --> 00:18.849
- Turin, open the door!

00:18.853 --> 00:21.265
- If you unlock that door,
he's gonna kill us all.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.387
He is not one of us!

00:22.398 --> 00:24.184
- Cardiff was all over my ass,

00:24.192 --> 00:25.523
and I let myself doubt.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.141
You're one
of the good ones, Fancy.

00:27.153 --> 00:28.268
- You're not.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.065
- Ohron is home of the Ferran,

00:30.072 --> 00:31.608
the most badass
outlaw mercenaries in the J.

00:31.616 --> 00:34.858
- When the Hullen come,
the Ferran will answer.

00:34.869 --> 00:38.407
- These ships are key
to reaching Aneela.

00:38.414 --> 00:41.201
And so far,
they only respond to D'Avin.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.870
- | just figured out what Khlyen

00:42.877 --> 00:44.538
was protecting in the Remnant.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.877
Brains.
Micro slices of a neocortex.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.542
It's where memories are stored.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.414
- Whose brains?
- It's a close match

00:50.426 --> 00:51.506
to you.

00:54.305 --> 00:55.715
-All right, boys and girls.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.714
Strap in,
put on some smooth jazz,

00:57.725 --> 01:00.558
and welcome to our first
flight maneuvers test run.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.301
Nice and easy.

01:02.313 --> 01:03.723
These ships are running
organic tech

01:03.731 --> 01:05.562
that we don't fully
understand yet,

01:05.566 --> 01:06.681
but with my fancy
glove controllers

01:06.692 --> 01:08.557
spliced with D'Av's DNA,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.560
those controls
should be your bitch.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.527
- You sound jealous, Jaqobis.
- You sound bored.

01:12.532 --> 01:14.693
Wanna kick things up with
a little delta five formation?

01:14.700 --> 01:16.236
- Oh, you know I do.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.484
- Synchronizing telemetry.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.326
Ten, nine...

01:19.330 --> 01:21.286
Eight, seven...

01:26.379 --> 01:28.290
The hells, Elis?

01:28.297 --> 01:30.583
- I didn't do anything.
She just moved on her own.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.671
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:31.676 --> 01:33.382
Everything looks normal.

01:33.386 --> 01:35.172
- I thought
you worked out the bugs.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.419
What's wrong?
- I told you, I don't know.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.419
- Well, figure it out!
- Hey!

01:37.431 --> 01:38.557
Give him some space.

01:38.558 --> 01:40.344
Now.

01:46.232 --> 01:48.439
- Break left! Break left!

01:48.442 --> 01:50.148
- Son of a bitch!

01:50.152 --> 01:51.653
The system's not responding.

01:51.654 --> 01:53.485
- Are you seeing this?
It's like they're in sync.

01:53.489 --> 01:54.604
- No. They aren't in sync.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.651
They're mirroring each other.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.650
- When one breaks right,
the other one breaks left.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.572
Okay, you two, listen close.

02:00.580 --> 02:03.242
We think your controls are in
some sort of feedback loop.

02:03.249 --> 02:04.580
- Oh, tits.
- Listen to me, every move

02:04.584 --> 02:06.370
you make
is affecting the other ship,

02:06.377 --> 02:07.492
so pick a parallel trajectory

02:07.503 --> 02:09.289
and stay the course, now.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.628
- Oh, shit, he's coming for me.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.462
What do I do?
- Pull up! Pull up!

02:17.680 --> 02:20.672
Ten zero niner, are you there?

02:22.977 --> 02:24.592
- Ten zero niner, come in.

02:26.606 --> 02:29.268
Ten zero niner, do you copy?

02:29.275 --> 02:30.515
- There are no life signs.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.232
- God damn it!

02:32.236 --> 02:33.646
You told us
you could fly these things.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.440
This is on you.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.375
We gotta say something
to the team.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.586
Hold morale.
- Morale?

02:52.590 --> 02:54.330
If you're the only one
who can control these ships,

02:54.342 --> 02:55.707
then we have no fleet.
If we have no fleet,

02:55.718 --> 02:57.379
then we have no chance.
- I know.

02:57.386 --> 03:00.423
- Dutch should have
been here for this.

03:00.431 --> 03:03.389
- Dutch kind of
took off last night.

03:03.392 --> 03:04.723
- What?
- I didn't want

03:04.727 --> 03:06.433
to say anything
in front of Turin.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.393
I figured she just took Lucy...

03:08.397 --> 03:10.388
get some space, clear her head.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.730
When I went to get her for
the flight test this morning,

03:11.734 --> 03:13.770
she still wasn't back.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.518
Look, you need to talk to her.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.736
I've tried.
You're better at it than me.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.321
— Maybe because
I don't try and kiss her

03:19.325 --> 03:20.815
right before a tragic funeral.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.817
Sweet move, by the way.
- Hey, that was her move.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.740
Point stands. Do your
"best friend power twins" thing.

03:25.748 --> 03:27.238
Talk her back.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.286
Lucy,
coordinates on Dutch, please.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.503
Lucy?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.800
- Hey, did you rewrite Lucy's
access codes to block John?

03:39.804 --> 03:41.340
Idon't want him finding us.

03:41.347 --> 03:42.462
- Oh, yeah.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.633
| Zephed all over his Jaqobis.

03:43.641 --> 03:46.257
| Zephed on it hard.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.474
- What exactly is this shit?

03:47.478 --> 03:48.718
- Ah, don't shake the brains!

03:48.729 --> 03:50.594
Sorry,
micro slices of a neocortex

03:50.606 --> 03:51.812
with chemically
encoded memories.

03:51.816 --> 03:53.556
- What makes you think these are.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.398
Aneela's memories?
- Your face, kinda?

03:55.403 --> 03:57.485
The sections of genome
l was able to analyze

03:57.488 --> 03:59.729
are virtually identical
to yours but Hullen.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.731
And we only know one
Hullen bitch who looks like you,

04:01.742 --> 04:03.403
so, ta-da, deduction.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.778
- And you think
you can help me relive them?

04:06.789 --> 04:08.745
- When I route the neurons
back through your hippocampus,

04:08.749 --> 04:10.410
your brain should process them
just like any other memory.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.624
What?

04:11.627 --> 04:13.367
- You have done this
before, right?

04:15.464 --> 04:17.375
- I've read about it.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.374
Twice.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.795
- Good.

04:22.388 --> 04:25.095
'Cause I like being first.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.464
- Whoa.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.387
- What is this place?

04:33.399 --> 04:36.311
- Defunct Company lab.
Still has all the toys I need.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.395
Look, um,

04:41.407 --> 04:42.738
I really don't know
what putting Hullenized shit

04:42.742 --> 04:44.448
in your brain will do to you.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.817
Are you sure
you want to risk it?

04:45.828 --> 04:48.365
- The Hullen destroyed
three of our allied RACs

04:48.372 --> 04:49.782
because of a fight I started.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.657
- Okay, but...
- I don't know how to win, Zeph.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.659
What's gonna happen when she
actually arrives at the Quad?

04:54.670 --> 04:55.910
How do I fight her?

04:55.921 --> 04:57.457
- I don't know.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.750
- Neither do I,

04:58.758 --> 05:01.545
but I knew Khlyen.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.417
He was protecting me
from Aneela.

05:03.429 --> 05:04.965
If he was hiding
those memories and sent D'Av

05:04.972 --> 05:07.429
to go and get them,
then they're meant for me.

05:07.433 --> 05:08.843
Maybe they'll tell me
her weakness, her endgame,

05:08.851 --> 05:10.432
something I can use to win.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.721
- What about the boys?

05:11.729 --> 05:12.809
Shouldn't they be
a part of this?

05:12.813 --> 05:13.802
- Do you miss them?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.679
- No. Whatever. Kind of.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.431
Do they talk about me?

05:17.443 --> 05:18.649
- I'll tell the Jaqobis
everything once there's

05:18.652 --> 05:20.358
something to tell, but for now,

05:20.362 --> 05:21.647
it's between us girls.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.520
Like, a...

05:23.532 --> 05:25.648
slumber party.
-Aww.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.910
But also,
you really need friends.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.786
- How's this gonna work?

05:31.791 --> 05:33.782
- The neurons will enter your
brain through the optic nerve.

05:33.793 --> 05:36.660
From there, they'll travel
through the temporal lobe

05:36.670 --> 05:38.376
to your hippocampus.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.638
- Since you're not encoded
in the memories,

05:49.642 --> 05:51.598
it should probably
feel a bit like

05:51.602 --> 05:53.012
watching someone else's dream.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.479
I'll be tracking
the electrical impulses

05:57.483 --> 05:58.939
in your cortex,

05:58.943 --> 06:00.729
so I should be able
to steer you through them

06:00.736 --> 06:03.694
kind of like a memory road map.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.857
lhope.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.606
Just tell me when.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.739
When.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.703
- Okay.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.576
- Try not to move.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.750
- This is your fault, you know?

06:22.758 --> 06:24.749
There has to be another way.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.502
- l have to remove your memories
to keep them out of the Green.

06:27.513 --> 06:28.844
No one can ever know
what you've done,

06:28.848 --> 06:31.009
or she will come for you.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.802
Now...

06:32.810 --> 06:34.721
Let's begin.

06:42.778 --> 06:45.440
- J‘ Ooh, ooh

06:45.447 --> 06:46.607
J“ Ooh, ooh

06:47.825 --> 06:50.658
J‘ Ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh J‘

06:51.704 --> 06:53.490
J“ Ooh, ooh

06:57.835 --> 06:59.041
- Aneela?

06:59.044 --> 07:00.580
- I'm running away.

07:01.714 --> 07:02.954
- Yes, | see that.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.540
A little fuel for your journey?

07:09.638 --> 07:12.505
- I don't want to leave here.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.596
My friends are here.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.807
Mommy's here.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.846
- Your mother will visit us.

07:16.854 --> 07:17.934
lhope.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.553
- She says you're a fool.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.975
- What's that one?

07:23.986 --> 07:25.977
- Arkyn.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.979
- Qresh is sinking, Neely.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.981
The ocean's are rising.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.904
Once people realize that,
war and strife will come.

07:32.912 --> 07:34.903
Now, if we stay here,

07:34.914 --> 07:37.906
I can offer you
your piece of a dying empire.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.157
But if we go...

07:40.920 --> 07:44.879
I can give you
a whole new world.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.123
Now, how many
Qreshi fathers can do that?

07:51.889 --> 07:54.756
- Khlyen is from Qresh?

07:54.767 --> 07:56.803
- Is that helpful?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.141
- Helps me understand
why he was always

07:58.145 --> 08:00.056
such a pompous git, I guess.

08:01.941 --> 08:03.647
That memory's too old.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.936
They're not even Hullen yet.

08:04.944 --> 08:06.809
I don't want home movies.
I want strategy.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.151
I want to know
what Khlyen was hiding.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.111
Can you pull me fonNard, please?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.652
- Yeah, but there's only so long
I can keep you in there

08:12.660 --> 08:14.616
before Aneela's neurons
attach to your cells

08:14.620 --> 08:16.952
and start replicating.
- I know the risks, Zeph.

08:16.956 --> 08:18.617
- Copy that.

08:18.624 --> 08:19.989
Making neurons my bitch
in five...

08:20.000 --> 08:21.740
3’

08:22.878 --> 08:24.163
- Aneela?

08:34.974 --> 08:37.056
What have you done?

08:41.105 --> 08:43.972
- I've been experimenting.

08:43.983 --> 08:45.974
Like father, like daughter.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.115
- This is not the legacy
I had in mind.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.981
- There's something wrong
with the way

08:53.993 --> 08:56.075
the plasma bonds
with the human bodies.

08:56.078 --> 08:59.787
It's... inefficient.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.623
If I can't fix them,
how will I ever fix me?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.207
- Where are you getting
these ideas?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.826
You don't need fixing.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.044
- Liar!

09:07.047 --> 09:09.663
The plasma perfects or kills.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.666
Why not me?

09:11.677 --> 09:16.091
Why do I still feel so much?

09:16.098 --> 09:17.804
- I don't know.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.220
Did I ever tell you
the story about the boy

09:24.231 --> 09:26.187
with two wolves in his heart?

09:26.191 --> 09:28.728
- You can't fix me with stories.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.897
- When the days were deep,

09:34.908 --> 09:39.902
an old man was teaching
his grandson about life.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.201
"A fight is going on inside me,"
he told the young boy.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.995
"A terrible fight
between two wolves.

09:46.003 --> 09:50.292
"One is anger, envy,
and self-pity.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.836
"Everything that is bad
in the world.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.754
The other wolf is good."

09:58.015 --> 09:59.801
No one can live with a heart

09:59.808 --> 10:01.764
that's at war
with itself, Aneela.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.977
If you want
to feel whole, let go.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.847
Our human lives are gone,

10:07.858 --> 10:09.223
but our future...

10:11.320 --> 10:13.777
ls endless.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.700
- Does the Green
speak to you too?

10:23.707 --> 10:25.117
- No.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.286
What does it say?
- She.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.329
- What does she say?

10:34.093 --> 10:36.084
- That I can't
trust you anymore.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.010
Which wolf are you, Papa?

10:46.730 --> 10:48.846
Where's your better half?

10:48.857 --> 10:50.848
Which one?
- The one that wears the pants.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.975
- You know Dutch doesn't
tell me everything, right?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.819
- Did she tell you she enlisted
a bunch of Ferran hippies

10:55.823 --> 10:57.279
as troopers for Khlyen's ships,

10:57.282 --> 10:58.988
which... oh, happy day...
It turns out

10:58.992 --> 11:00.243
we don't know how to fly?

11:00.244 --> 11:01.905
Here's a riddle:

11:01.912 --> 11:03.322
How are we supposed
to defend ourselves

11:03.330 --> 11:05.992
against a goddamn armada
with no aerial capability?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.990
We're sitting ducks.
- We're working on it.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.992
John thinks they're designed
to be flown in unison

11:10.003 --> 11:11.994
like birds in migration
or a hive of bees.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.132
- Does he know how
to pilot a hive of bees?

11:14.133 --> 11:15.964
- He does not.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.797
- Where is Dutch?

11:19.805 --> 11:22.968
- Wow. Okay.
Question of the day.

11:22.975 --> 11:25.057
Dutch is sorry
that she couldn't be here.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.891
She's on a mission.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.807
- We came a long way
to fight in her war.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.897
Lachlan gave his oath to her,
not to the RAC.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.936
- And Dutch honors that oath.

11:33.944 --> 11:36.230
She'll be back by morning.
I give you my word.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.778
But you need to find Fancy.
- Fancy?

11:45.789 --> 11:48.121
- Fancy was Khlyen's
right-hand man.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.036
He's gotta know how to fly
those ships.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.908
We're not exactly friendly
at the moment,

11:51.920 --> 11:54.832
so go be charming and shit.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.296
- Did you get all that?
- Kinda.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.291
Dutch is still missing,
the sky is falling,

11:58.302 --> 12:00.258
and you have to be
charming, so...

12:00.262 --> 12:02.218
We're probably all gonna die.
- Yeah.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.962
Basically.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.305
Where's Zeph?
Have you found her yet?

12:05.309 --> 12:07.015
- Oh, Zeph's gone.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.019
She took off with
some of her research files

12:11.023 --> 12:12.934
last night right before
Lucy went silent.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.933
- Well, that is definitely
a coincidence.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.230
Can't you make Lucy
give us some coordinates?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.194
- Someone's locked me
out of her system,

12:20.199 --> 12:21.939
and Dutch is the only one
with the override codes.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.235
- Johnny,
is the Remnant still there?

12:24.453 --> 12:25.909
- No.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.071
Shit.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.164
They took it.
What are you thinking?

12:31.168 --> 12:33.159
- Remember what Zeph said
before the funeral?

12:33.170 --> 12:36.412
Something about being able
to inject whatever was inside?

12:38.342 --> 12:40.207
- Looks like Zeph extracted
neurons from the sample.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.426
She was working on a way
to implant them in someone.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.135
- Yeah, someone like Dutch.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.470
Okay. Enough.

12:45.474 --> 12:46.930
We have to find her
and stop this.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.299
- I'll find Dutch.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.971
I've got an offsite clone
of Lucy's drive,

12:49.978 --> 12:51.354
and I will find a back way in.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.016
Now, you find a way
to get those ships

12:53.023 --> 12:54.979
operational
and calm everyone's tits

12:54.983 --> 12:56.314
before this whole army
falls apart at the seams.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.229
- How?
I'm not the tit whisperer.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.398
- You are today. Turin's right.
Go sweet-talk Fancy.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.316
If anyone knows Khlyen's tricks,
it's him.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.861
- Here we go...

13:19.132 --> 13:20.383
Ready?

13:20.384 --> 13:22.966
- Yes.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.801
- Dragon and...

13:26.265 --> 13:28.472
Rooster.
- Rooster beats dragon.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.306
- One day, I am going to win.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.050
- I very much hope so.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.180
- How are plans going
with Qresh?

13:36.191 --> 13:38.307
- They've struck our family line
from the record,

13:38.318 --> 13:40.400
which feels a bit rude.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.269
The other nine families
are at war,

13:42.281 --> 13:45.023
deciding how to answer
our Hullen ultimatum.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.490
Once they're over this
last little temper tantrum,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.155
we'll come to terms
and proceed with our plans

13:49.162 --> 13:50.447
to colonize the Quad.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.070
- We can go home again?

13:54.126 --> 13:55.366
- Perhaps.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.327
- Don't go.
I hate it when you go.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.294
- Aneela,
we've talked about this.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.005
| always come back.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.249
And you have
everything you need.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.421
- You know I don't.
You took it away!

14:05.429 --> 14:07.010
- Where did you get that peach?

14:09.224 --> 14:10.885
Who's been visiting you?

14:13.270 --> 14:16.262
- You're not the only one
with secrets.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.349
I'm sorry. I take it back.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.271
Don't go!

14:22.279 --> 14:23.940
- It's safer for you here,

14:23.947 --> 14:25.323
until I understand
how to help you.

14:25.324 --> 14:27.531
- You know what will help me.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.399
Give me what I need, Papa.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.447
The Green.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.366
Don't leave me!

14:35.208 --> 14:37.369
Don't leave me!

14:57.481 --> 15:00.223
Mercy.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.098
Mercy.
- Hey!

15:02.110 --> 15:04.066
This a fetish thing,
or can anybody play?

15:04.071 --> 15:06.357
- Nope.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.356
- We need your help, Fancy.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.358
- Coming to me
instead of Mommy...

15:10.369 --> 15:12.405
That's a first.
- We tried flying Khlyen's ships

15:12.412 --> 15:14.403
in formation this morning.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.200
Lost two good pilots
in the attempt.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.199
- I'm sorry to hear that.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.418
War's a bitch.
- Yeah, but you usually aren't.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.252
Look, Fancy,

15:23.256 --> 15:26.214
without these ships,
Aneela hands us our asses.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.550
You're too good a man
to want that.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.089
What are we missing?

15:33.392 --> 15:35.428
When the ships
come into proximity,

15:35.435 --> 15:37.221
they form a neuro-link,

15:37.229 --> 15:39.311
so a single pilot
can control the fleet.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.430
- Okay. Is this offensive
or defensive?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.523
- Both.
You can take any ship out

15:43.527 --> 15:46.143
without losing formation.

15:46.154 --> 15:49.146
- So can you teach us
how to fly them as a unit?

15:49.157 --> 15:51.364
- You, maybe.
A basic human? No.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.108
Your brain needs
to have been Hullen-wired

15:53.120 --> 15:55.076
for it to work.
- Whoa, "have been"?

15:55.080 --> 15:57.036
So can the Cleansed
pilot these ships for us?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.621
- Don't get excited.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.661
Most of us are just trying
to figure out what it means

16:00.669 --> 16:02.284
to be human again.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.546
Not everyone wants to fight.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.330
- 34 ships, 34 pilots.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.584
That's all I need.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.300
- I'll ask around.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.514
One condition.
- Anything.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.474
- Have our back.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.185
Cleansed have taken a lot
of shit from Killjoys lately.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.440
It's not right.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.181
- Of course.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.650
- Come on, Lucy, baby.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.447
I may not know
where your body is,

16:36.455 --> 16:38.662
but I can import
your A.l. logs like a beast.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.702
I'm gonna have your brain up
and running here in no time.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.575
- Ah-ah-ah.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.329
- Shit-balls.
- Nice try, Jaqobis,

16:46.339 --> 16:48.466
but if you're getting this
message, then you've failed.

16:48.467 --> 16:50.332
I found the back door
you wrote into Lucy's code,

16:50.343 --> 16:51.719
and I shut that shit down.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.551
- God damn it, Zeph.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.466
- Dutch gave me orders
to lock you out,

16:55.474 --> 16:57.305
but you gave me orders
to think of the team,

16:57.309 --> 17:00.221
so this is me doing both.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.219
I wrote a fail-safe
into the program.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.095
You're my fail-safe.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.599
- Good things do not come
in small packages.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.522
What is this? Math?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.235
You coming at me
with math, Zephyr?

17:11.239 --> 17:13.355
Well, you better come correct.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.692
- I estimate it should take you

17:16.703 --> 17:18.694
seven hours
to decode this message.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.741
If things go well,
we'll be back long before then.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.614
If things go wrong,
crack this code

17:22.626 --> 17:24.412
and regain access
to Lucy's system

17:24.419 --> 17:26.375
so you can save the day.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.505
And also, Dutch.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.462
Hallowed be her name.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.127
Don't let us down.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.249
Please.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.383
Okay, I skipped around a bit.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.470
Anything yet?

17:38.475 --> 17:39.590
- She's alone.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.645
When the nights were long

17:52.656 --> 17:55.238
and the days were deep,

17:55.242 --> 17:59.702
there lived a girl in a tower.

18:12.425 --> 18:16.759
All girls are filled with magic.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.550
So bit by bit,

18:19.558 --> 18:22.300
day by day,

18:22.310 --> 18:25.518
year by year...

18:25.522 --> 18:27.808
the girl saved her magic

18:27.816 --> 18:30.432
and hid it from the man...

18:35.323 --> 18:38.315
Until she could escape
her tower.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.617
- She's stubborn as shit,
but she's not stupid.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.239
Dutch is doing this
for a reason.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.707
- Any luck tracking her down?

18:47.711 --> 18:49.451
- Zeph killed
all my access codes

18:49.462 --> 18:50.838
and borked up
all of Lucy's security.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.795
- You're saying
she outsmarted you.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.415
- If you want to get technical
and be kind of a dick.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.759
- Look, I don't care how
you get her back. Just do it.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.344
I'll try to convince
the Ferran to stay.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.428
I hate today.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.803
Nice fur.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.855
What is that? Varmint?

19:07.856 --> 19:11.474
- Drowning your sorrows
already, huh?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.611
- Well, it's war o'clock.

19:13.612 --> 19:15.694
We all have our
coping mechanisms, I guess.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.688
— Puppies.
- Hmm?

19:17.699 --> 19:20.486
- I like puppies.
Just really get in there

19:20.493 --> 19:22.279
for some hard-core cuddles,
you know?

19:24.331 --> 19:25.867
I like to knit them
little sweaters.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.865
- | see what Pree enjoys
about you, Gared.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.491
You're an interesting man.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.464
- Yeah. Okay.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.675
Look, I know
Dutch still isn't back,

19:38.678 --> 19:40.634
and I should have told you
that we're having problems

19:40.639 --> 19:42.379
with the ships,
but you can't leave.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.766
Your commander gave us his oath.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.553
- To her, not to you.
- To the cause.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.551
- Causes are defined by people.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.553
The Ferran have a saying:

19:49.564 --> 19:51.555
"Peace is a painting,
war is a mirror."

19:51.566 --> 19:54.353
- I really don't need
military philosophy, thanks.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.352
l was army for 15 years.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.478
- Well, then you know
the difference

19:57.489 --> 19:59.354
that leadership makes.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.607
The Ferran need to know
the real heart of whoever it is

20:01.618 --> 20:04.360
we follow because
that's what shapes the war.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.737
Lachlan speaks
for Dutch's heart.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.488
I don't know yours.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.541
- Hey,
your heart rate's going up.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.379
Maybe we should call it.
- No!

20:17.384 --> 20:18.874
— Stress floods your brains
with chemicals.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.591
It screws with my controls.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.297
- I know that song.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.423
- What song?

20:39.948 --> 20:41.438
No!

20:41.449 --> 20:42.734
- Whoa, okay.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.403
You need to take a breath.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.322
Dutch, do you hear me?

20:46.329 --> 20:48.240
- I know what Khlyen
was hiding in those memories.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.832
-Yala...

20:56.631 --> 20:57.711
Me.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.219
- Okay.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.633
Uh...

21:06.641 --> 21:08.222
Soto regroup,

21:08.226 --> 21:12.469
your crazy archenemy
was once your babysitter?

21:12.480 --> 21:15.142
- I think she's my mother.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.106
- She's... not.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.600
- I don't need you to sugar...

21:18.611 --> 21:20.442
- No, I mean, she can't be.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.688
It's not
scientifically possible.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.155
The Hullen can't breed, right?

21:24.159 --> 21:25.649
That's why they need us
as hosts.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.693
- Why was I with her as a child?

21:31.249 --> 21:33.490
Why do I look like her?

21:35.253 --> 21:37.665
- Okay.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.833
If you go back in,

21:39.841 --> 21:41.832
you have to promise me
to stay calm this time.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.297
lneed
your neurotransmitters steady.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.842
OthenNise,
I could lose you in there.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.840
And if you die...

21:51.728 --> 21:53.684
l'll feel really, really bad.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.486
- Deal.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.187
- This is stupid dangerous.

22:04.199 --> 22:05.735
So many of us
meeting in one place.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.573
- I trust Jaqobis.
You're being paranoid.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.657
- I'm being alert.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.741
You can feel it, right?

22:09.746 --> 22:11.657
The change?

22:11.664 --> 22:13.655
Hullen just slaughtered
a bunch of Killjoys

22:13.666 --> 22:15.657
in their own RAC
out in the open like cows.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.329
Survivors are afraid of us now.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.827
They don't believe
we're really cured.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.124
- This is our chance
to prove we are.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.509
To get back at the Hullen
for what they did to us.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.592
What are you doing?

22:25.595 --> 22:26.710
- See where they're headed?

22:26.721 --> 22:28.586
- Killjoys, so?

22:28.598 --> 22:30.680
- Turin's goons, and that's
the Cleansed base camp.

22:34.312 --> 22:37.850
- Let go of me!
Where are we going?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.313
- This is your fault.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.228
You led them here.
- How?

22:41.236 --> 22:43.272
With a time machine?
They got here first.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.770
- Did you use your Killjoy PDD
to arrange this meet?

22:48.117 --> 22:51.780
Tell me again
how you trust Jaqobis.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.119
- Come on.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.373
Don't think like you, Johnny.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.160
Think Zeph.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.828
Peppy. Obnoxious.
Obsessed with being right.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.578
That tech-hating bio snob.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.328
Computer, remove all numbers.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.626
Isolate for organics,
filter through the database,

23:04.634 --> 23:05.623
and identify all patterns.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.849
Zeph, you little shit.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.684
- It's about time, John.

23:16.688 --> 23:18.770
- Whoo! Seven hours my ass.

23:18.773 --> 23:20.388
Lucy, where is Dutch?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.765
I need you to help me
find her, girl.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.892
- Processing.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.643
Sending coordinates.
- Lucy,

23:25.655 --> 23:27.395
if you had a body right now,
I would kiss it.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.773
- Ifl had a body right now,
I would let you.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.866
- Still creepy, Lucy.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.406
- Hey!

23:33.413 --> 23:35.278
- Hey.
- You happy?

23:35.290 --> 23:36.700
- Not really.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.323
Agh!

23:38.334 --> 23:40.791
Ah, damn it!
What was that for?

23:40.795 --> 23:41.830
- Like you don't know?

23:41.838 --> 23:43.294
- Fancy, you know me.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.289
I'm a shit liar.
- The Cleansed.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.712
They're being rounded up
and detained by the RAC.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.801
It's Turin.
- No.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.340
Turin wouldn't do that.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.884
He's annoying.
He's not war-crime-y.

23:53.892 --> 23:55.348
- I warned you.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.307
The Cleansed are the only ones

23:57.312 --> 23:59.303
who can fly your damn ships.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.804
You just lost the war.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.317
- Your vitals are stable.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.660
You want to tell me
what's happening in there?

24:15.663 --> 24:17.699
- I'm in her room.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.698
- You'd like Qresh.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.667
Water as far as you can see.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.835
And if you stand
atjust the right angle,

24:27.842 --> 24:32.711
you can fit all three moons
in the palm of your hand.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.804
- What's a moon?

24:42.440 --> 24:45.932
- How would you like to help me
get out of here, little bird?

24:45.944 --> 24:48.560
Go on an adventure.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.650
Whoa, what just happened?

24:52.659 --> 24:53.944
I wasn't done.
- That wasn't me.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.863
You jumped to another memory
on your own.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.781
I told you, you have to
stay calm or I can't control...

24:57.789 --> 25:00.371
- I know this place.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.286
My harem.

25:02.293 --> 25:04.284
The day I met Khlyen.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.677
- What are you doing here?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.266
How did you get out?

25:22.730 --> 25:24.061
Who is she?

25:24.065 --> 25:26.056
- A gift.
- No games.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.773
- I've been waiting
for you to find her.

25:27.777 --> 25:29.062
- Where did you
get the child, Aneela?

25:29.070 --> 25:31.061
Why does she look like you?

25:31.072 --> 25:32.983
- I did something bad.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.902
- Who's the father?

25:36.786 --> 25:38.071
- You are.

25:43.793 --> 25:46.284
- Dutch?

25:46.295 --> 25:47.705
Dutch, where are you?

25:47.714 --> 25:49.295
Are you okay?
- No! I

25:49.298 --> 25:50.549
- You're jumping
all over the place.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.381
I can't find you
on her neuro-map.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.795
- I'm not in her memory anymore.

25:54.846 --> 25:56.461
I'm in mine.

26:00.810 --> 26:04.098
On my wedding night...

26:12.447 --> 26:13.812
-Yala...

26:16.784 --> 26:19.696
- Shit! Dutch,
you're having a seizure.

26:21.039 --> 26:22.995
Dutch, can you hear me?

26:28.004 --> 26:29.084
- Come on, breathe. Breathe!

26:30.173 --> 26:32.038
Okay, this is happening,
and it's bad

26:32.050 --> 26:33.881
but it's happening right now,
so fix it. Fix it!

26:39.807 --> 26:40.842
Oh, trees...

26:45.104 --> 26:46.139
- Run.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.348
- Adrenaline popper
in three, two...

26:56.240 --> 26:57.525
Bella...

26:57.533 --> 26:59.114
Bella har-jamay.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.383
- Well, make yourself at home.

27:17.386 --> 27:20.093
- You used me
to find the Cleansed.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.589
- | used Fancy, technically.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.306
- What exactly do you plan
on doing with them?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.811
- Nothing kinky.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.143
They'll have three squares,

27:27.146 --> 27:29.102
fair accommodations.
It's all legit.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.977
I just want 'em
where I can see 'em.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.565
- You can't just arrest them.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.150
- Oh, stop it.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.145
It's easy to get
all morally superior when

27:37.156 --> 27:39.317
you're not the one with
people's lives in your hands.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.281
- You don't deserve anyone's
life in your hands, Turin.

27:41.285 --> 27:44.027
- We don't know who the hells
these Cleansed are.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.154
What if they turn on us
in the middle of a battle?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.281
Just like those goddamn ships
this morning.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.953
Boom. Game over.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.292
- We need them to win this war.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.286
- Why do you think
I sent you to find them?

27:53.297 --> 27:56.164
But we can't just
hand them our ships.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.382
We gotta study them.

27:58.386 --> 28:00.377
Get inside their heads.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.128
Just to be safe.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.301
Till we're sure.
- Yeah.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.640
I've been in enough wars,
I know how this speech ends.

28:06.644 --> 28:09.852
- Then you know that,
sometimes, it's still right.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.856
- Zeph? Hey!

28:17.864 --> 28:20.230
It's me.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.902
- Where's Dutch? What happened?
- She's gone.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.319
It's all gone to shit.

28:23.327 --> 28:24.988
She got thrown out
of Aneela's memories,

28:24.996 --> 28:26.202
and now she's trapped,
reliving her own

28:26.205 --> 28:27.945
like a badass Sleepwalker.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.242
- She say where she's going?

28:29.250 --> 28:31.161
- No, she was talking
all foreign.

28:31.169 --> 28:33.034
I'm sorry. Is that racist?

28:33.045 --> 28:34.626
I think I get racist
when I'm bleeding out.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.211
- No, you're gonna be okay.
The cut's not deep.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.080
Just try and remember
exactly what she said.

28:38.092 --> 28:41.175
- Okay.
Uh, something about... bells?

28:41.179 --> 28:43.170
And bellies? And a jar?

28:43.181 --> 28:45.217
- "Bella har—jamay"?
- Yeah. What does that mean?

28:45.224 --> 28:48.387
- "I am your queen" in Keffryn.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.055
I'll be back.
I know where she's going.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.927
- Where?
- To meet the charming bastard

28:51.939 --> 28:53.895
who's about to change her life.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.567
Worst slumber party ever.

29:28.351 --> 29:31.093
- Well, hello, gorgeous.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.970
Hey, ship system?

29:33.981 --> 29:35.721
Reverse patchflow on my command.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.189
- No.

29:37.193 --> 29:38.729
- What do you mean, no?

29:38.736 --> 29:40.237
- Do monosyllables trouble you?

29:40.238 --> 29:42.069
I could try grunts.

29:42.073 --> 29:44.109
- Well, you are
a sassy britches, aren't you?

29:44.116 --> 29:46.983
I'm gonna fix that as soon as
I bust this admin code cherry.

29:48.454 --> 29:51.241
Ship?
- Yes, thief?

29:51.249 --> 29:53.410
- Are we still alone?
- No, thief.

29:57.088 --> 29:58.248
- Hi.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.543
Johnny Jaqobis, lover of ships.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.087
- Yala Yardeen, killer of men.

30:04.095 --> 30:05.380
- Yup.

30:05.388 --> 30:07.128
Yours is better. Yeah.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.970
Could we talk about this?

30:08.975 --> 30:11.011
| feel like maybe
we should talk about this.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.009
- How about I shoot you
another mouth hole

30:13.020 --> 30:14.180
and you talk to yourself?

30:15.314 --> 30:16.474
You're funny.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.313
For a queen.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.023
Half this planet's
been throwing you a party

30:20.027 --> 30:21.437
for the past five days,
so,yeah,

30:21.445 --> 30:22.651
I know who you are.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.152
You're hurt?

30:27.159 --> 30:29.445
- It's not my blood.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.284
And it's not your business.

30:31.289 --> 30:33.245
- Hey, lady, you do the math.

30:33.249 --> 30:35.205
You're royalty. I'm just
a thief passing through.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.915
Whatever you've done,
who'd believe me?

30:38.296 --> 30:41.038
So let me help you.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.004
— Why?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.334
- Kind of my thing.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.301
- You need this ship
to get off world.

30:48.306 --> 30:51.298
- I may also need to get out
of here fast myself, yes.

30:51.309 --> 30:53.391
You're not the only one
with a complicated life.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.308
- This ship was a wedding gift.

30:58.316 --> 31:00.022
Are you sure
you know how to fly it?

31:00.026 --> 31:02.733
- Lady, I can fly anything.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.025
Look, whatever trouble
you are in...

31:08.534 --> 31:10.820
We don't have to stay here.

31:10.828 --> 31:13.490
We can just fly away
and never look back.

31:18.294 --> 31:21.331
You at the good part yet?

31:21.339 --> 31:23.170
- I can tell you
how it all ends.

31:29.555 --> 31:32.092
- What's happening?

31:32.099 --> 31:34.431
- Just a little reality whammy.
Give it a sec to kick in.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.346
- Don't speak to me
like you know me!

31:36.354 --> 31:38.140
- I know that you're having

31:38.147 --> 31:39.557
the worst day of your life
right now, Dutch,

31:39.565 --> 31:41.521
but if you hold on
and get through it,

31:41.525 --> 31:44.232
it leads to all your best ones,
I promise.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.851
- What do you want?

31:45.863 --> 31:47.649
- I want to give you
my hand again

31:47.656 --> 31:50.113
and ask you to trust me
one more time

31:50.117 --> 31:52.369
because deep down inside,

31:52.370 --> 31:54.235
you always do.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.861
Come on.

31:55.873 --> 31:57.329
Dutch, give me the gun.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.163
John...

32:03.464 --> 32:04.544
Shit!

32:04.548 --> 32:06.834
Johnnleohnny?

32:06.842 --> 32:08.378
Oh, my God.
What did ljust do?

32:08.386 --> 32:11.344
- You're back.
Also, ow!

32:14.350 --> 32:17.342
- I love you, Dutch,

32:17.353 --> 32:19.389
but you don't get
to shoot me twice.

32:27.238 --> 32:28.523
-All right, everybody.
Calm down.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.279
Decisions were made.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.898
- Why would we fight for an army
that turns on its own?

32:32.910 --> 32:34.446
- They aren't
our people anymore.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.909
It was a tactical call.

32:35.913 --> 32:37.244
- You're not a soldier, Turin.

32:37.248 --> 32:38.658
You're middle management.

32:38.666 --> 32:40.907
Give it a rest.
- Sass all you want, padre.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.533
The Cleansed are already
in the brig.

32:42.545 --> 32:44.160
- Not anymore.

32:46.549 --> 32:49.131
They've agreed to pilot
the Black Root ships.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.420
- And we're just supposed
to trust them?

32:50.428 --> 32:51.634
- Yes, you are.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.673
Like they're trusting us.

32:53.681 --> 32:57.265
Even after we rounded them up.
- I expected better, Jaqobis.

32:57.268 --> 32:58.553
The Hullen destroyed our RACs

32:58.561 --> 33:00.392
and you're defending
their leftovers?

33:00.396 --> 33:02.603
- The Cleansed are victims.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.392
They hate the Hullen
more than any of us,

33:04.400 --> 33:05.731
and no one will fight harder
against them.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.270
We need them.

33:07.278 --> 33:09.940
We need everyone here.

33:09.947 --> 33:12.529
If we turn on one another,
we have nothing.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.740
- Oh, I hope
this is a pissing contest

33:14.743 --> 33:16.404
'cause I feel hydrated as shit.

33:16.412 --> 33:17.652
Or is it just plain mutiny?

33:17.663 --> 33:19.244
- This was never your army.

33:19.248 --> 33:21.660
- Oh, 'cause it's hers, right?
Okay.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.749
Where is
the mighty Dutch right now?

33:23.752 --> 33:26.289
We're all fighting
this war, D'Avin.

33:26.297 --> 33:28.413
The only person
Dutch is fighting is Aneela,

33:28.424 --> 33:30.631
and she will
risk all of us to do it.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.499
That's not what
any of us signed up for.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.423
- Well, they didn't sign up
for you either.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.513
Commander Alfred Olyevich Turin,

33:37.516 --> 33:40.428
you're under arrest for sedition
and crimes against your people.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.427
- Oh, yeah?
Where I'm standing,

33:42.438 --> 33:43.644
you're a little
outnumbered, son.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.308
You and whose army?

33:45.316 --> 33:46.681
- Mine.

33:50.237 --> 33:52.273
The Ferran will fight
with Jaqobis.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.272
We pledge our oath to him.

33:54.283 --> 33:56.774
- The Scarbacks stand
with Jaqobis.

33:56.785 --> 34:00.277
- Cardiff's refugees
will follow Jaqobis.

34:04.460 --> 34:05.540
- Take him.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.249
- With pleasure.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.460
- So Aneela and baby Dutch.

34:15.471 --> 34:18.258
That's, uh, pretty...

34:18.265 --> 34:20.517
- I know you don't want me
going back in there,

34:20.518 --> 34:22.679
and I can't promise you
any tactical advantage...

34:22.686 --> 34:24.597
- I don't give a shit
about tactics right now.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.436
I give a shit about you.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.681
And if this is what you need,

34:28.692 --> 34:31.308
this is what we do.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.605
But if anything bad
happens in there,

34:32.613 --> 34:34.604
I'm coming in to find you.

34:34.615 --> 34:36.526
- Pretty sure that's impossible.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.490
- Challenge accepted.

34:40.496 --> 34:42.737
Hey, Zeph, how does this work?

34:42.748 --> 34:44.329
- I've mapped where she's been.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.415
| just need to know
which memory.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.828
- My harem.

34:47.836 --> 34:51.078
What really happened
the day I met Khlyen.

34:51.090 --> 34:52.626
That's what he's hiding.

34:52.633 --> 34:55.500
- Try to be
less slashy this time.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.593
- Yeah. Sorry about that.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.269
- What do you mean
I'm the father?

35:08.274 --> 35:09.810
Don't be absurd. Enough!

35:09.817 --> 35:11.557
Where did you find
the child, Aneela?

35:11.569 --> 35:13.525
Why does she look like you?

35:13.529 --> 35:15.110
- This is your fault, you know?

35:17.408 --> 35:19.273
I missed you so much.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.116
- I visited as often as I could.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.327
- No!

35:23.330 --> 35:25.491
I missed who we used to be.

35:25.499 --> 35:28.536
Before everything went wrong.

35:28.544 --> 35:31.377
Before Arkyn.

35:31.380 --> 35:32.540
Don't you?

35:35.843 --> 35:38.550
Sometimes...

35:38.554 --> 35:40.795
when I'm very alone,

35:40.806 --> 35:42.797
I visit our old memories

35:42.808 --> 35:45.140
over and over

35:45.144 --> 35:46.509
in the Green.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.392
You were so kind to me
back then...

35:54.403 --> 35:57.315
Before you were you.

36:00.451 --> 36:02.362
After a while...

36:03.746 --> 36:06.533
Watching wasn't enough.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.848
- How is this even possible?

36:26.852 --> 36:28.763
We put memories into the Green.

36:28.771 --> 36:31.137
We can't take them out.

36:31.148 --> 36:33.264
- I can.

36:39.490 --> 36:42.573
She's the me I should have been
if we never went to Arkyn.

36:44.453 --> 36:46.444
She's your good wolf, Papa.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.740
Maybe now you can forgive me...

36:50.751 --> 36:53.618
for not being good enough.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.375
Where are you going?

37:00.386 --> 37:02.547
- To protect you.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.545
Like always.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.547
The Lady must never know
what you've done.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.640
Go. Now.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.188
- Hello.

37:25.536 --> 37:27.618
- Do not eat that, child.

37:31.709 --> 37:33.916
That smell...

37:33.919 --> 37:35.659
Like almonds?

37:36.964 --> 37:38.750
It means the flesh has fermented

37:38.757 --> 37:40.497
into a deadly toxin.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.750
A single bite could've
made you sick for days.

37:53.897 --> 37:57.435
You are Yalena,
of the family Yardeen.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.729
- The others say
it's a shameful name.

38:01.739 --> 38:04.822
- Perhaps you can change that.

38:04.825 --> 38:07.612
Restore Yardeeni honor.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.452
Your father's counting on it.

38:10.456 --> 38:13.539
He sent me to find you,
little bird.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.533
To train you.

38:15.544 --> 38:17.785
And protect you.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.629
It won't be easy.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.793
And you'll have
to keep it a secret.

38:27.723 --> 38:30.806
Whatever hate they spew at you,

38:30.809 --> 38:33.721
whatever punishment,

38:33.729 --> 38:35.720
the truth is,

38:35.731 --> 38:37.596
you're special, Yala.

38:37.608 --> 38:39.564
And your father...

38:41.570 --> 38:44.277
He will do everything
he can to protect you.

38:48.285 --> 38:50.742
Now...

38:50.746 --> 38:53.988
have you ever heard the story

38:53.999 --> 38:56.706
of the wasp and the bear?

38:57.878 --> 38:59.869
- You okay?
Did you get what you needed?

39:16.146 --> 39:17.932
- Everything okay?

39:19.733 --> 39:21.439
- Yeah.

39:21.443 --> 39:23.024
All good.

39:25.823 --> 39:28.030
Kitaan said that
this is a remission,

39:28.033 --> 39:30.445
not a cure.

39:30.452 --> 39:33.159
- Well,
Hullen say a lot of shit.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.742
What do you think?

39:44.007 --> 39:47.841
I turned on my squad because
a chip in my head told me to.

39:47.845 --> 39:50.461
I've seen veterans get cold feet

39:50.472 --> 39:52.713
and newbies save the day.

39:52.724 --> 39:56.012
No soldier comes
with a guarantee.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.010
All we can ask for
is their loyalty.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.981
So do we have yours?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.814
- Yes.

40:06.822 --> 40:09.814
- Good.

40:12.119 --> 40:14.451
Then you have mine.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.615
Welcome back.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.499
-Ah, 0W!

40:25.507 --> 40:27.088
You have such beef hands.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.878
- Stop fidgeting, you weirdo.

40:30.387 --> 40:33.049
- I thought I had things
under control, but I didn't.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.967
I nearly killed her.
- Are you the one who decided

40:34.975 --> 40:36.886
to huff Aneela brains
for breakfast?

40:36.894 --> 40:39.180
- Well, I did figure out how.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.769
- You gave her the options
and told her the risks.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.183
That's ourjob.

40:43.191 --> 40:46.183
She decided to take it
because that's hers.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.185
Then you pulled
a Jaqobis special.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.027
- What?

40:50.032 --> 40:52.523
- You disobeyed herjust enough
to keep Dutch safe.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.525
You stole my move.

40:54.536 --> 40:56.117
- Nice work.
- Mm-hmm.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.204
- Ooh, wait,
maybe don't heal it 100%?

40:59.207 --> 41:01.198
Scars are cool.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.824
- Scars are cool.

41:02.836 --> 41:05.953
- J‘ There are things

41:05.964 --> 41:09.832
J“ I have done

41:09.843 --> 41:12.255
J“ There's a place

41:12.262 --> 41:13.547
- Badass.

41:13.555 --> 41:15.386
- J‘ I have gone

41:17.809 --> 41:19.094
- Hey.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.181
- Hey.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.141
You had us worried.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.563
- Yeah. Sorry.

41:29.571 --> 41:31.812
Stuff and things.

41:33.158 --> 41:37.026
I hear! have you to thank
for holding this place together.

41:37.037 --> 41:39.153
- People need a leader, Dutch.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.075
Thought that's what you wanted.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.995
- I needed to find out
what was in Aneela's head.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.833
- By lying to us?

41:45.837 --> 41:47.247
Taking off
and putting yourself at risk?

41:47.255 --> 41:49.120
No, you didn't.
- Are you angry with me?

41:49.132 --> 41:50.588
- I'm worried.

41:52.094 --> 41:54.255
You said you're having doubts.

41:54.262 --> 41:55.877
Well, now I'm having them.

41:55.889 --> 41:58.175
You're not yourself these days.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.014
- That's definitely true.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.009
- Then talk to me.

42:05.232 --> 42:07.974
- I can't.
Not about this.

42:07.985 --> 42:10.101
- See, this isn't about you.

42:10.112 --> 42:11.818
This war is about all of us,

42:11.822 --> 42:14.108
and it's going on
with or without you, Dutch.

42:14.116 --> 42:15.947
And if we're gonna win,

42:15.951 --> 42:17.612
you gotta stop acting
like a lone wolf.

42:17.619 --> 42:19.280
That's not what
we need right now.

42:20.914 --> 42:23.121
We need a leader.

42:23.125 --> 42:25.116
- You're right.

42:25.127 --> 42:26.913
I'm not the wolf you need.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.330
I can't be a leader right now.

42:28.338 --> 42:30.954
I don't want to be.

42:30.966 --> 42:33.548
But you do.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.964
It's your army, D'Av.

42:35.971 --> 42:37.962
Take good care of it.

42:44.604 --> 42:48.188
- J‘ There's a game

42:48.191 --> 42:51.979
J“ That I played

42:51.987 --> 42:54.899
J” There are rules

42:54.906 --> 42:59.149
J” I had to break

42:59.161 --> 43:02.904
J“ There's mistakes

43:02.914 --> 43:05.200
J“ That I made...
