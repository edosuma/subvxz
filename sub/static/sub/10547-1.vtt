02:16.352 --> 02:19.354
Rescue 3.
Jessie, do you see him yet?

02:20.230 --> 02:22.274
Patience, my love, patience.

02:26.194 --> 02:28.488
Wait a minute.
I think I have him sighted.

02:28.572 --> 02:30.407
Frank, what's the word?

02:31.491 --> 02:33.452
The word is we got him
over there.

02:37.956 --> 02:40.250
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Over.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.877
This is 3. Go ahead.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.213
Jessie, we're getting general clearance
in the southeastern region of the park.

02:45.297 --> 02:49.009
You will probably have sufficient
cloud base to get into the tower...

02:49.092 --> 02:52.763
but please be advised you'll still
encounter strong winds and turbulence.

02:52.804 --> 02:55.723
We would advise
against a winch rescue. Over.

02:55.806 --> 02:59.226
Wilco, Center. I'll proceed
with wire cross from opposite tower.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.771
- Three out.
- Center out.

03:16.702 --> 03:20.039
Gabe, Hal's signaling he's okay.

03:21.665 --> 03:22.875
Gabe?

03:24.376 --> 03:26.170
Gabe, where are you?

03:26.253 --> 03:28.255
I'm just hanging out, Jess.

03:29.006 --> 03:30.882
Oh, my God.

03:35.220 --> 03:38.723
I don't recognize the face,
but the butt does look vaguely familiar.

03:38.807 --> 03:42.477
Hey, be careful,
or you'll embarrass old Frank.

03:42.519 --> 03:44.979
It would take a heap more
than that, rock-jock.

03:45.063 --> 03:46.606
Yeah.

04:25.644 --> 04:26.895
Gabe?

04:26.979 --> 04:29.231
They're below
the top of the tower.

04:29.314 --> 04:31.316
They're on the ledge
just above you.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.402
You got another few feet.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.618
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah, sure. Hi, Sarah.

04:42.702 --> 04:44.036
Hi, Gabe.

04:44.078 --> 04:46.664
So, how's the knee?

04:46.747 --> 04:49.167
I think it's out.
No big deal.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.879
I remember when you twisted it
getting out of that hot tub.

04:53.796 --> 04:56.382
I thought it was
an old war wound from 'Nam.

04:56.466 --> 04:58.426
Really? Hmm.

04:59.510 --> 05:00.887
Rescue 3.

05:00.970 --> 05:03.389
I've located a stranded climber.

05:03.431 --> 05:06.225
Jessie, please send down
a transport line.

05:16.777 --> 05:18.695
So, tell me, how you feeling?

05:18.779 --> 05:21.072
Fine, considering.

05:21.114 --> 05:23.408
What do you say we take off...

05:23.450 --> 05:26.828
and leave this clown behind, huh?

05:26.912 --> 05:28.121
Don't tempt me.

05:35.128 --> 05:36.421
Rescue 3.

05:36.505 --> 05:38.840
Please be advised
that Ranger Walker...

05:38.924 --> 05:41.093
is making advances
toward my girlfriend...

05:41.134 --> 05:44.721
that's liable to get his ass kicked
right off this mountain.

05:44.805 --> 05:46.973
Be informed Gabe makes advances
to me only...

05:47.057 --> 05:49.935
or he'll be climbing down
4,000 feet and sleeping outside.

05:50.977 --> 05:52.478
Baby, he lies.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.555
- Is it really 4,000?
- Yeah, just about.

06:28.638 --> 06:33.059
Hey, remember, whatever this guy says
about me, don't believe it, okay?

06:33.143 --> 06:34.394
Thanks.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.491
Okay. Come on over.

06:52.996 --> 06:56.458
I know you're nervous, but
we've done this a hundred times, okay?

06:56.541 --> 06:58.001
Mm-hmm.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.506
Excuse me, Captain Hot Tub?

07:06.049 --> 07:08.677
Keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle at all times.

07:11.388 --> 07:12.848
That's great, Hal.

07:14.266 --> 07:16.351
That really inspires confidence.

07:22.816 --> 07:26.570
So, how did this clown talk you
into climbing up to the tower?

07:26.653 --> 07:28.947
He told me
it was better than sex.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.616
Really?

07:33.410 --> 07:35.537
You ready for the best ride
in the park?

07:35.579 --> 07:38.623
Give me a second.
I'll let you know.

07:50.510 --> 07:52.512
You look like hell.

07:52.595 --> 07:53.888
He made it.

07:53.971 --> 07:55.890
Of course he did.

07:55.973 --> 07:58.059
Really, there's nothing to it.

07:58.142 --> 07:59.936
Okay, I can do this.

08:00.019 --> 08:01.479
Sure you can.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.815
I'm sorry
for all the trouble, really.

08:03.898 --> 08:06.359
- Oh, Sarah, don't worry about it.
- Thanks.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.236
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:11.656 --> 08:14.407
- We're still on for dinner tonight?
- Of course we are.

08:14.491 --> 08:15.909
Okay.

08:17.035 --> 08:19.162
Okay. You're ready now.

08:19.246 --> 08:20.497
That's it.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.086
Now, just sit
right down into it.

08:28.463 --> 08:30.424
Come on, guys.
The wind's picking up.

08:32.092 --> 08:34.385
Sarah, just keep
your eyes on me.

08:34.469 --> 08:35.886
No, don't look... Sarah.

08:35.971 --> 08:38.515
Sarah, look at me.
That's it.

08:38.597 --> 08:41.643
- Right.
- Just start to pull.

08:41.726 --> 08:43.602
One hand after another.

08:43.645 --> 08:47.107
You're doing great...
really, great. Keep goin'.

08:48.024 --> 08:50.943
And just keep looking at me.

08:51.026 --> 08:53.571
That's great!
You're starting to look like a pro.

08:53.654 --> 08:55.406
Keep going.

08:55.489 --> 08:57.324
That's it.
Nice and easy.

08:57.408 --> 09:00.619
Hey, Hal, we're gonna
be out of a job soon.

09:00.661 --> 09:02.204
A little more, Sarah.

09:02.288 --> 09:03.789
That's it.

09:04.957 --> 09:06.792
One, two.

09:11.964 --> 09:13.382
Oh, God!

09:13.466 --> 09:15.301
Gabe! Gabe!

09:15.342 --> 09:17.344
No!

09:17.386 --> 09:18.888
Hold on!

09:20.055 --> 09:23.058
- I'm going to fall!
- No, you're not!

09:23.142 --> 09:24.976
You're going to be okay!

09:25.018 --> 09:29.481
- Can you reach the main line?
- No, I can't! I'm slipping!

09:29.522 --> 09:32.817
- Gabe, can you keep the line steady?
- That clip's not gonna hold!

09:32.901 --> 09:35.862
I can't hold on!
Help me, please!

09:35.904 --> 09:38.573
- Gabe, you have to go after her.
- No!

09:38.656 --> 09:41.493
- Gabe, no!
- I'm coming out to get you!

09:41.576 --> 09:45.371
It's not rigged for two. Keep it from
swinging. I'll send out my harness.

09:45.455 --> 09:47.415
No time!
I'm going for her!

09:47.499 --> 09:50.460
Gabe, shit! No!

09:50.543 --> 09:52.212
Sarah, I'm coming for you!

09:52.295 --> 09:54.214
I can't hold on! I'm slipping!

09:54.297 --> 09:57.050
Hold on just a little bit longer!
I'm coming for you!

09:57.133 --> 10:00.344
Gabe, please hurry!
I can't hold on!

10:00.427 --> 10:02.805
Don't look down.
Keep looking at me.

10:02.888 --> 10:05.724
- That's it. Hold it.
- I'm trying!

10:07.226 --> 10:09.478
It's breaking.
She's losing it.

10:09.561 --> 10:13.649
Sarah! He'll have you
in a second, baby!

10:13.732 --> 10:16.193
Come on, baby!
Don't you give up!

10:18.028 --> 10:20.364
Hurry, Gabe.
You're almost there.

10:20.447 --> 10:22.783
- Keep going.
- I'm here, Sarah.

10:22.866 --> 10:24.618
Sarah, I'm here.

10:25.577 --> 10:27.496
I don't want to die!

10:27.579 --> 10:30.833
Reach up and grab him!
Reach up!

10:30.916 --> 10:33.460
- Sarah, reach up!
- Come on, honey!

10:33.544 --> 10:35.378
- Use your other hand!
- Reach up!

10:40.758 --> 10:43.803
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you! I got you.

10:43.886 --> 10:46.806
I can't hold on!
I'm going to die!

10:46.889 --> 10:49.225
You're not going to die.

10:50.601 --> 10:52.812
Don't you lose her, Gabe.

10:52.895 --> 10:54.564
I got her. Reach up.

10:54.605 --> 10:57.066
I'm slipping. I'm slipping!

10:58.609 --> 11:01.404
- You can do it, Sarah.
- Hold her, Gabe!

11:01.446 --> 11:03.239
Please don't let me tall.

11:03.281 --> 11:05.491
Please, I don't want to die.

11:05.575 --> 11:07.452
- You're not gonna die.
- I'm slipping!

11:07.535 --> 11:09.704
Sarah, I got you!
Just reach up!

11:09.787 --> 11:11.913
I can't, Gabe!

11:11.955 --> 11:14.374
You can do it.
Please, baby, just reach up!

11:14.458 --> 11:17.252
Hal! Hal! I'm slipping!

11:17.294 --> 11:19.588
Gabe, man, don't you lose her!

11:19.629 --> 11:22.132
- Don't you let her go!
- Don't let me tall.

11:24.134 --> 11:26.428
I'm slipping!

11:26.511 --> 11:28.013
Sarah, please.

11:28.096 --> 11:30.015
No, I'm slipping! Gabe!

11:30.098 --> 11:32.017
Gabe, don't let me tall!

11:32.100 --> 11:35.437
- No!
- Help me! I'm falling! Gabe!

11:45.989 --> 11:48.783
No! Sarah, no!

11:58.959 --> 12:01.295
Jesus Christ.

12:22.690 --> 12:26.194
Treasury Agent Mac Lamoore,
please contact D. A. U.

12:36.663 --> 12:38.248
Lock 'em up.

12:39.707 --> 12:42.669
Travers, we'll be fueled up
and ready to go in ten minutes.

12:42.710 --> 12:44.921
Very good.

12:51.177 --> 12:52.762
Mr. Travers.

12:55.598 --> 12:56.933
- Hey, Rich.
- Morning, Walt.

12:57.016 --> 12:59.017
This is Agent Matheson, F. B. I.

12:59.101 --> 13:00.185
Travers.

13:00.269 --> 13:03.522
Matheson has been transferred
from the Denver office to Frisco.

13:03.564 --> 13:07.693
As a professional courtesy
I was asked if he could hitch a ride.

13:07.734 --> 13:10.237
Got plenty of room.
Be glad to accommodate you.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.281
- Appreciate it.
- You're the boss.

13:12.364 --> 13:15.033
Let's go. Matheson,
have you been totally briefed?

13:15.075 --> 13:18.370
- I don't know about totally.
- Who the hell ever is?

13:18.412 --> 13:21.248
It's the most protected shipment
we've got and the most useless.

13:21.331 --> 13:23.333
These bills aren't even
in circulation.

13:23.417 --> 13:26.545
$1,000 bills we're transporting are only
used for international banking exchange.

13:26.628 --> 13:28.380
You always transport
through the air?

13:28.422 --> 13:31.049
Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked,
trains derailed...

13:31.133 --> 13:33.301
but nobody can touch us in flight.

13:33.384 --> 13:36.053
Haven't lost a bill in 12 years.
Don't jinx me now.

13:36.137 --> 13:40.141
Treasury agents are the most
superstitious people in the government.

13:40.224 --> 13:42.727
We should be.
Everybody wants what we have.

14:01.245 --> 14:03.247
Gabe! Hey, man, Gabe!

14:03.331 --> 14:05.583
- It's Gabe. He's back!
- I can see that.

14:07.043 --> 14:09.086
Come on, man. Let's go!

14:30.023 --> 14:31.525
How you doing, Gabe?

14:31.608 --> 14:33.610
Dude, turn that down.

14:33.693 --> 14:36.279
You guys.
How you doing, Brett, Evan?

14:36.363 --> 14:39.324
Where you been?
You fall off the planet or something?

14:39.408 --> 14:42.744
- No, I've been working up in Denver.
- Work?

14:42.828 --> 14:44.286
Don't say that word.

14:44.328 --> 14:47.039
I hate work, even when
somebody else is doing it.

14:48.207 --> 14:51.752
Gabe, we're flying off the tower today.
You should come with us.

14:51.836 --> 14:54.463
Today's going to be the day
for a killer jump.

14:56.882 --> 14:58.884
- No, thanks. Can't.
- Come on, man.

14:58.968 --> 15:02.346
Don't tell me that job in Denver
made you scared of heights?

15:06.016 --> 15:09.728
You guys better watch out 'cause
some bad weather's comin' in, okay?

15:09.812 --> 15:12.064
We like it extreme.

15:13.357 --> 15:16.569
Hey, man, see you later, Gabe.
Good to have you back.

15:16.652 --> 15:18.654
Yeah, good to see you. Later.

15:18.738 --> 15:20.321
Peace.

15:37.213 --> 15:39.174
How you doing, Jess?

15:45.054 --> 15:46.639
Hello, Gabriel.

15:49.684 --> 15:51.603
Got yourself a new horse?

15:54.230 --> 15:57.649
- Where have you been?
- Just working.

15:59.109 --> 16:01.862
After the funeral,
I just had to leave.

16:01.904 --> 16:04.031
Had to leave?

16:05.115 --> 16:07.618
Believe me, a lot of us
wanted to leave.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.078
But you know what?

16:09.161 --> 16:11.080
We stayed.

16:13.957 --> 16:15.542
Jess...

16:16.752 --> 16:18.879
a lot of things fell apart
on that ledge.

16:18.962 --> 16:20.547
I know.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.550
But I don't think
you know how much.

16:23.592 --> 16:26.386
Why can't you just believe
you did everything you could?

16:26.428 --> 16:28.931
Did I? I don't know.

16:29.014 --> 16:31.224
Maybe I shouldn't have
gone out on that line.

16:32.433 --> 16:35.561
Maybe I panicked.
I don't know.

16:35.645 --> 16:37.730
I was there, remember?

16:37.814 --> 16:40.108
You were the only one
who didn't panic.

16:40.191 --> 16:43.820
Why don't you do us a favor
and quit hording all the guilt?

16:43.903 --> 16:47.865
You held on as long as you could.
And what about Hal?

16:47.949 --> 16:51.744
What was Hal doing on the tower
with a girl who could barely climb?

16:51.786 --> 16:54.580
I can't blame Hal for anything.
It was me.

16:55.873 --> 16:57.291
All me.

16:57.375 --> 16:59.877
Well, give it up, Gabe...

16:59.961 --> 17:02.505
because let me tell you something...
it doesn't get any better.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.258
It doesn't get any better?

17:07.592 --> 17:10.429
I really don't think
you understand.

17:10.470 --> 17:13.932
- What?
- I don't think you understand.

17:13.973 --> 17:15.934
I don't understand?

17:17.310 --> 17:20.230
I think I'm the only one
that understands.

17:22.315 --> 17:25.569
Believe me, there were times when I
didn't know what I wanted to do more...

17:25.652 --> 17:28.280
hate you or love you.

17:29.489 --> 17:32.451
But one thing I did know
and I still do know...

17:32.534 --> 17:34.786
is I understand you.

17:47.965 --> 17:50.217
Did you come back to stay?

17:56.348 --> 17:57.933
You didn't.

18:01.187 --> 18:02.563
I can't.

18:04.065 --> 18:05.983
I can't. Not here.

18:07.860 --> 18:10.321
Jessie, I came back for you.

18:10.404 --> 18:14.116
And it you like,
I want you to come with me.

18:17.786 --> 18:22.665
You come back after being gone for
almost a year and expect me to leave?

18:24.793 --> 18:26.961
This is our home.

18:28.379 --> 18:30.173
Now it's my home.

18:30.215 --> 18:34.010
And I can't just pick up and go
for all the wrong reasons.

18:43.394 --> 18:46.856
If you don't mind, I'd better
pick up the rest of my stuff.

18:46.898 --> 18:49.567
You know where everything is.

18:49.651 --> 18:51.861
I'm late for work.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.627
Hey, big boy.

19:19.930 --> 19:22.015
Roger, Five-Lima,
scattered, broken clouds...

19:22.099 --> 19:24.351
20,000 feet with
a severe storm advisory.

19:24.435 --> 19:26.562
Check the storm scope.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.751
Travers says
you're being transferred.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.836
Oh, yeah.
Moving up in the world.

20:07.934 --> 20:10.771
The forecast... cloudy skies
with flurries today.

20:10.812 --> 20:14.066
We can expect an inch of snow
and a high in the low 30s.

20:14.149 --> 20:18.070
Overnight flurries will increase with
a total accumulation of three inches.

20:18.153 --> 20:19.988
Tonight's low near 15.

20:20.072 --> 20:22.866
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time
for another masterpiece.

20:22.949 --> 20:24.409
Hiya, Jess.

20:24.493 --> 20:27.954
Oh, I think old Frank
nailed it with that stroke.

20:27.996 --> 20:29.831
What do you think?

20:29.915 --> 20:32.000
I don't know.

20:32.084 --> 20:34.086
What do you see?

20:34.169 --> 20:35.462
Surprise me.

20:35.504 --> 20:37.964
What usually eats a banana?

20:38.048 --> 20:39.799
A monkey.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.468
This is a picture
of a banana eating a monkey.

20:42.551 --> 20:45.054
- Nature in reverse.
- Where?

20:46.347 --> 20:47.723
Right here.

20:49.141 --> 20:53.312
Frank, you look like
a normal guy, but he's not...

20:53.354 --> 20:55.064
are you, Frankie?

20:55.147 --> 20:56.899
Hey, I'm an artist.

21:10.538 --> 21:11.997
We're being tracked.

21:12.081 --> 21:14.290
- Jetstar, three o'clock.
- Travers!

21:14.374 --> 21:17.460
Stay put. Don't anyone
jump to conclusions.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.552
- He's coming in too slow.
- No, we're going too fast.

21:25.635 --> 21:28.763
We're too high. Give me 180 knots,
drop to 15,000 feet.

21:28.847 --> 21:30.682
You got it.

21:30.723 --> 21:34.519
Christ. We're losing altitude
and slowing down. Get your weapons.

21:34.602 --> 21:37.439
What the hell are you doing?
I have jurisdiction on this jet.

21:38.982 --> 21:42.193
Now I have jurisdiction.
I said get your weapons!

21:42.277 --> 21:45.155
These are highly trained agents,
Mr. Matheson.

21:45.238 --> 21:49.159
I think you're overreacting.
Just calm down and give me the gun.

21:49.242 --> 21:52.035
- You're out of control.
- What the hell are you waiting for?

21:52.077 --> 21:54.371
He's hijacking the shipment.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.518
What the fuck was that?

22:29.822 --> 22:31.574
- Move into position.
- Look alive, Kristel.

22:31.657 --> 22:33.993
Crossover transfer,
ten seconds and counting.

22:34.077 --> 22:35.912
November 1-2-niner-five Lima...

22:35.995 --> 22:38.372
this is Jetstar
6-8-0 Tango-Tango.

22:38.456 --> 22:41.084
Is frequency secure? Over.

22:41.167 --> 22:43.920
Roger, Tango-Tango.
This is Five-Lima. Go ahead.

22:44.003 --> 22:47.924
We have visual contact. What is
your heading, speed and level? Over.

22:48.007 --> 22:51.385
We're heading 0-8-0
and doing 2-5-0 knots level...

22:51.469 --> 22:53.930
at flight level 2-1-0-niner.

22:53.971 --> 22:55.932
Five-Lima, we're opening up.

22:55.973 --> 22:57.975
Rise and shine, gentlemen.
Let's make history.

22:58.059 --> 23:00.560
Roger, Five-Lima.
We'll begin closing.

23:00.644 --> 23:02.687
Bring your speed back to 1-5-0.

23:02.771 --> 23:07.609
Commence descent to flight level 1-4-0
and turn right onto 2-6-0. Over.

23:09.653 --> 23:13.573
We're level. Flight level 1-4-0
and steady, 2-6-0 degrees.

23:13.657 --> 23:15.575
The weather ahead
looks a bit threatening.

23:15.659 --> 23:17.619
Roger.

23:17.702 --> 23:20.455
- Travers, report your position.
- Ready to disengage tail cone.

23:20.497 --> 23:22.082
Stand by.

23:28.547 --> 23:31.466
- Tail cone's clear.
- Roger.

23:47.314 --> 23:49.483
Phase one complete.

23:50.526 --> 23:52.403
Tango-Tango,
prepare to receive cable.

23:52.486 --> 23:55.614
Tango-Tango standing by.

23:55.698 --> 23:57.616
Tango-Tango,
what's the turbulence back there?

23:57.700 --> 24:02.037
She's all over the place. This thing's
got the response of a 747 at this speed.

24:02.121 --> 24:05.833
Sounds like fun. We're streaming the
drogue down. We'll see you in a minute.

24:05.916 --> 24:08.461
Welcoming party's ready.
Good luck.

24:08.544 --> 24:12.130
We're moving in to pick up
the drogue now. Tango-Tango out.

24:18.636 --> 24:20.430
I've got it.
Stand by, Kristel.

24:20.513 --> 24:22.432
Standing by.

24:24.517 --> 24:26.686
We're locked on.

24:26.770 --> 24:28.855
Into the transfer position.

24:28.938 --> 24:30.148
Check.

24:30.190 --> 24:32.609
Moving into transfer position.

24:32.692 --> 24:35.236
We're closing to 1-4-0 feet.

24:35.320 --> 24:39.199
We're closing.
We'll report when in position.

24:41.826 --> 24:45.163
- We're too close to the storm.
- Don't lose your nerve.

24:45.205 --> 24:48.207
All they'll find is a plane
that went down in the storm.

24:48.248 --> 24:51.251
- Hurry up, Travers.
- On my way.

24:51.335 --> 24:53.587
The cases are hooked up
and ready.

24:55.714 --> 24:59.426
Charge goes off in five minutes.
Stick to the plan and you're rich.

24:59.510 --> 25:01.720
Got it.

25:01.804 --> 25:04.390
Tango-Tango in position.

25:04.473 --> 25:06.725
- What's taking so long?
- Patience.

25:09.770 --> 25:12.481
Tango-Tango, dip the plane.
I'm coming over.

25:12.564 --> 25:15.401
Wilco, Five-Lima.
Tango-Tango standing by...

25:15.442 --> 25:17.986
at flight level 1-4-0
and steady 2-6-0 degrees.

25:21.198 --> 25:23.324
Five-Lima, I'm out of here.

25:23.408 --> 25:24.826
Roger.

25:28.621 --> 25:31.124
What the hell is he doing?

25:32.208 --> 25:35.086
Five-Lima, where are the cases?

25:43.553 --> 25:45.638
- Kristel, we've got him.
- Roger.

25:45.722 --> 25:48.015
Why didn't you send
the money first?

25:48.099 --> 25:52.061
Somehow, I didn't think
you'd wait for me if I sent it first.

26:12.873 --> 26:16.042
We're approaching the storm fast.
I can't hold this course much longer.

26:16.126 --> 26:19.212
- 9-0 seconds.
- What's keeping him?

26:20.297 --> 26:22.466
Let's move your ass up there.

26:24.259 --> 26:26.303
I'm at the cases.
Stand by.

26:26.386 --> 26:28.305
Tango-Tango standing by.

26:28.388 --> 26:29.806
You fuck.

26:37.772 --> 26:39.356
We've lost the pilot.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.358
- Who did you leave up there?
- No one.

26:46.739 --> 26:50.701
Get underneath the jet.
The cases will slide over.

26:55.206 --> 26:57.291
Who the fuck is our guest?

27:07.676 --> 27:10.428
Just get those cases.

27:10.512 --> 27:12.472
He's hurt bad.
What should we do with him?

27:12.555 --> 27:15.600
Get him to a hospital, fast.

27:20.188 --> 27:23.149
- We're not leveling out.
- 1-0 seconds.

27:23.233 --> 27:25.151
I've lost hydraulics!

27:41.251 --> 27:43.086
The cable's blown tree.

27:43.169 --> 27:45.587
Don't unhook it.
The cases are still there.

27:45.671 --> 27:48.048
- Don't lose the money, goddamn it!
- Hold it.

27:48.090 --> 27:50.551
- Pull the cable!
- We gotta pull!

27:50.592 --> 27:52.636
- Bypass switch one.
- Check.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.763
- Bypass switch two.
- Keep pulling.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.890
- Nothing.
- Switch to manual.

27:56.974 --> 27:58.892
Hold the fuckin ' plane steady!

27:58.934 --> 28:02.479
- Pull! Come on!
- Travers, don't fuck it up!

28:02.563 --> 28:04.857
- How's number one engine?
- Oil pressure falling.

28:04.898 --> 28:08.318
- Come on. Don't lose the money.
- They're coming.

28:08.402 --> 28:10.195
Goddamn it! Shit!

28:11.905 --> 28:14.575
- We've lost it.
- Oh, fuck!

28:16.285 --> 28:17.870
Release the cable.

28:21.289 --> 28:22.665
Close it up.

28:26.085 --> 28:29.047
So this is your idea
of a foolproof plan?

28:29.130 --> 28:32.425
You stupid bastard.
Kristel, what's the report?

28:32.508 --> 28:35.553
The hydraulics aren't functioning.
He shot them out.

28:35.595 --> 28:37.138
Fire warning, line tour.

28:37.221 --> 28:39.432
I'm losing altitude.
We're gonna go down!

28:39.515 --> 28:42.351
Dump the fuel. You'll have to pick
your way through the peaks.

28:42.435 --> 28:44.270
Close the fuel valve and pumps!

28:46.064 --> 28:49.984
Don't bother to buckle up.
You may not want to survive this.

28:50.068 --> 28:52.737
Flaps to 25 degrees
before we lose all power.

28:52.779 --> 28:54.822
Flaps, 25 degrees.

28:54.906 --> 28:57.741
Reduce power 60%.
Shut down all generators.

29:01.661 --> 29:04.456
Lower flaps. You may have
to hand-crank them down.

29:12.214 --> 29:15.717
-You want the gear down?
-Leave the gear up. Shut down all power.

29:15.801 --> 29:19.262
Give me a hand
with the controls.

30:04.056 --> 30:06.016
Wow! Did you catch that thunder?

30:06.058 --> 30:08.643
That was too loud for thunder.
Let's rock and roll.

30:08.727 --> 30:12.188
One, two, three!

30:15.692 --> 30:17.652
- I'm free!
- Radical, man.

30:17.736 --> 30:20.697
Man, look at me. Watch this.

30:31.291 --> 30:32.709
Mike?

30:37.172 --> 30:38.757
Shit.

30:45.304 --> 30:47.389
You thought of everything,
didn't you?

30:47.473 --> 30:49.391
Everything except
what's happening now.

30:50.809 --> 30:53.812
Kill the pig!
Your fucking plan almost killed us!

30:54.897 --> 30:59.026
Kill the pig, my ass.
We're partners in this.

30:59.068 --> 31:00.194
Were.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.238
Give me the tracking monitor.

31:03.322 --> 31:05.741
What the hell are you
gonna do with it?

31:05.824 --> 31:07.409
Don't make him ask twice.

31:07.493 --> 31:10.079
Give it to him.

31:10.162 --> 31:13.457
You want it? Take it.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.001
It's only got
50,000 code variations.

31:16.085 --> 31:18.252
I'll break your fucking neck
in a minute!

31:18.336 --> 31:20.463
- Go ahead. Break my fucking neck!
- Sit down.

31:22.006 --> 31:24.133
In case you slept
through the landing...

31:24.217 --> 31:27.095
you'll need all the money you can find
to buy your way out of this country.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.347
You know it,
and I know it.

31:29.430 --> 31:32.350
How do we get off the mountain,
even if we find it?

31:34.811 --> 31:36.104
Kristel.

31:39.273 --> 31:42.151
I think we found a frequency.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.780
Somebody help, please.

31:45.863 --> 31:48.491
Is there somebody there?
Somebody please help.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.411
Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.579
Oh, thank God!

31:54.663 --> 31:59.042
Ah, we're stranded.
We were hiking and lost our bearings.

31:59.126 --> 32:01.378
We didn't expect
the weather to come in this fast.

32:01.461 --> 32:05.924
Just take it easy.
How many people in your party? Over.

32:07.801 --> 32:10.929
Five people.
I don't know where we are.

32:12.055 --> 32:16.810
I... I see only a cylinder-type
rock formation. Over.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.520
It's got to be Comb Bluff.

32:18.603 --> 32:22.107
Winds are too strong to get a chopper
up there. Try to stay calm.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.192
We're on our way.
You're gonna be all right.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.654
Please hurry.
Billy's going into shock.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.780
Please, we need insulin.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.324
Please, hurry.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.037
"We need insulin."

32:39.832 --> 32:41.959
Would you have thought of that?

32:54.555 --> 32:56.515
- Thank God you didn't leave.
- Why?

32:56.557 --> 32:59.143
Emergency call. Five climbers
are stranded off Comb Bluff.

32:59.226 --> 33:02.396
The weather's pouring in,
and Hal's gone up alone.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.898
- Hal's a good climber.
- What?

33:04.981 --> 33:07.025
What's that supposed to mean?

33:07.108 --> 33:09.652
It means he can handle it himself.

33:11.571 --> 33:14.908
It he gets socked in by the weather,
they'll never make it down.

33:14.991 --> 33:17.994
Gabe, he needs someone
who has emergency medical training...

33:18.036 --> 33:20.080
and knows every handle
to those peaks.

33:20.163 --> 33:23.750
I'm the last one he wants help from, and
that's not what I came back here for.

33:23.833 --> 33:26.544
Our problems are not the issue
right now. Those people are.

33:26.586 --> 33:29.381
What it he can't do it alone?

33:29.464 --> 33:32.467
Look, Jessie,
I haven't climbed in months.

33:32.550 --> 33:34.344
You just lose the feel.

33:34.386 --> 33:37.180
Maybe you mean the nerve.

33:43.811 --> 33:45.729
I didn't mean that.

33:48.565 --> 33:50.526
It's okay.

33:50.567 --> 33:53.862
I know you don't want to be responsible
for anybody's life anymore...

33:53.904 --> 33:56.907
but I'm talking about somebody
that was your best friend.

33:56.990 --> 33:58.909
Please, Gabe,
he took the west ridge.

33:58.992 --> 34:02.037
It you take the north face,
you can beat him.

34:03.580 --> 34:06.667
What has happened to you?
Don't you feel anything anymore?

34:06.750 --> 34:10.713
Feel anything?
Jessie, I came back for you.

34:10.754 --> 34:12.715
I'm not talking about me.

34:12.755 --> 34:14.716
I'm talking about you.

34:17.092 --> 34:19.429
Go ahead... leave.

34:19.469 --> 34:22.974
But if you don't do it, you'll be stuck
on that ledge for the rest of your life.

34:48.666 --> 34:50.625
Where the hell is that
goddamn plane?

34:50.708 --> 34:53.253
Looks like she went down
in the storm.

34:53.295 --> 34:57.007
That storm front is still building, so
even it we could send a search plane...

34:57.090 --> 34:59.968
it would be impossible
to see anything on the ground.

35:00.010 --> 35:03.805
- What about roads?
- There aren't any roads up there.

35:03.889 --> 35:05.807
Mr. Wright.

35:05.891 --> 35:08.351
These two F. B. I. agents
insist on seeing you.

35:08.435 --> 35:11.104
I'm Agent Hayes.
This is Agent Michaels.

35:11.146 --> 35:14.483
It you're concerned about your agent who
got a ride, I've nothing to tell you.

35:16.318 --> 35:19.654
Matheson wasn't along for the ride.
He was working surveillance.

35:19.738 --> 35:21.782
Surveillance? Of what?

35:21.865 --> 35:25.118
The Bureau have been getting reports
Treasury jets were being monitored...

35:25.160 --> 35:26.994
between Denver
and San Francisco.

35:27.036 --> 35:29.997
We didn't tell you because
we thought it might be an inside job.

35:30.039 --> 35:33.417
That's impossible.
You're suggesting a hijacking?

35:33.501 --> 35:36.921
No. Not only did I have
my best men on that flight...

35:37.004 --> 35:39.423
but each one of those cases
were monitored.

35:39.507 --> 35:42.468
And the money
is in unexchangeable denominations.

35:42.510 --> 35:45.513
It would be useless
for anybody to try to steal it.

35:45.596 --> 35:47.348
Except for this man.

35:47.390 --> 35:49.809
- Who the hell is this?
- Name is Eric Qualen.

35:49.850 --> 35:52.728
We've been tracking him
without much success.

35:52.812 --> 35:54.730
He's a former member
of military intelligence...

35:54.814 --> 35:57.316
who found it more profitable
going to the other side.

35:57.358 --> 36:00.820
Industrial espionage.
Hijacking diamonds from South Africa.

36:00.903 --> 36:03.863
Theft and disposal of millions
in negotiable bearer bonds.

36:03.947 --> 36:08.451
You name it. He has the international
connections to move this currency...

36:08.535 --> 36:12.706
and $100 million offers one hell
of a temptation to this psychotic.

36:12.747 --> 36:15.041
Jesus Christ.

36:42.359 --> 36:45.028
What the hell
are you doing up here, man?

36:45.070 --> 36:47.531
I was talking to Jessie.
She filled me in.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.283
Did she?

36:49.366 --> 36:51.452
Well, now let me till you in.

36:51.535 --> 36:56.915
You can take your ass down and go back
to that hole you've been hiding in.

36:58.333 --> 37:01.378
Once we get these people down,
I'm gone, Hal.

37:01.462 --> 37:04.214
No. You're out of here now.

37:06.550 --> 37:10.179
Why the hell did you come up here?
To prove something?

37:10.262 --> 37:12.680
Look, I know how you feel
about me, all right.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.640
You don't know anything!

37:15.725 --> 37:19.353
You did it your way
and she died.

37:28.654 --> 37:31.491
- I did what I thought was right.
- Well, you were wrong.

37:31.574 --> 37:33.951
It was your weight on the line
that did it.

37:34.035 --> 37:36.579
There wasn't time
for anything else.

37:36.662 --> 37:38.539
Well, I guess we'll never know.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.625
It was a bad time for everybody.

37:40.708 --> 37:43.336
What the hell do you know
about bad times, man?

37:43.419 --> 37:46.881
You didn't love her, and you didn't
have to explain to her family.

37:46.964 --> 37:49.966
And you didn't have to look
into her eyes when she was falling!

37:50.050 --> 37:52.803
- Now drop it!
- No, buddy!

37:55.555 --> 37:58.100
It was you who dropped it.

38:07.526 --> 38:09.486
You want to do it?

38:09.569 --> 38:11.154
Do it.

38:16.410 --> 38:18.328
You live with it.

38:49.692 --> 38:51.819
They're here.

38:51.902 --> 38:53.904
Right on time.

38:53.988 --> 38:56.741
How many of them are there?

38:56.824 --> 39:00.785
We got two heroes.
We'll greet 'em at the top.

39:08.334 --> 39:11.254
- Where's the helicopter?
- What the hell's going on?

39:15.300 --> 39:18.803
- Where's the helicopter?
- It can't fly in this weather.

39:18.887 --> 39:21.890
- Is either of you a chopper pilot?
- No.

39:21.973 --> 39:24.267
What are your names?

39:24.350 --> 39:26.352
Tucker and Walker.

39:26.436 --> 39:28.271
We're missing three bags.

39:28.354 --> 39:29.939
What's in them?

39:30.023 --> 39:31.399
None of your fucking business!

39:31.483 --> 39:36.403
Suits, socks, $100 million,
the usual stuff.

39:36.445 --> 39:39.365
Travers here was smart enough
to bring along a tracking device.

39:39.406 --> 39:41.700
Don't use my name, goddamn it.

39:50.793 --> 39:52.086
Key it.

39:54.296 --> 39:57.591
Look at the map. This is where
we've lost our belongings.

39:57.674 --> 40:00.427
The red dots on the monitor
are the three cases.

40:00.511 --> 40:03.097
You recognize these locations?

40:06.308 --> 40:07.935
Let me jar your memory.

40:08.018 --> 40:10.186
It you don't recognize them,
you're useless.

40:10.269 --> 40:13.189
Useless items
are usually discarded.

40:13.272 --> 40:16.359
- Right, Travers?
- Get off my back, Qualen.

40:17.276 --> 40:18.820
Oft?

40:18.903 --> 40:22.281
I haven't even got on it yet.

40:22.323 --> 40:26.994
Once again, do you recognize
these locations?

40:32.875 --> 40:34.502
Ryan.

40:41.718 --> 40:44.220
Yeah. We do.

40:44.303 --> 40:46.012
Then let's go.

40:50.976 --> 40:53.437
Wait a minute, asshole!

40:57.149 --> 40:58.316
Where is it?

41:04.489 --> 41:06.116
Up there.

41:08.326 --> 41:12.122
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.
Hal? Come in, Hal.

41:12.164 --> 41:15.000
Nice. You're Hal?

41:16.918 --> 41:19.004
You, stay. You!

41:21.881 --> 41:23.340
Fetch.

41:30.765 --> 41:33.184
Fetch!

41:33.225 --> 41:34.810
Do it.

41:40.775 --> 41:43.027
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.

41:43.069 --> 41:45.279
Do you copy?

41:45.363 --> 41:49.033
Hal, come in.
Hal, come in. Over.

41:58.541 --> 42:02.170
Watch yourself under the overhang.
It could deliver anytime.

42:02.212 --> 42:05.840
Anytime you feel
like saying something, don't.

42:05.924 --> 42:08.134
We're waiting, gentlemen.

42:08.218 --> 42:10.345
- I need my bolt gun and ice ax.
- No.

42:10.387 --> 42:13.473
- Don't give him anything.
- Take his coat for insurance.

42:14.474 --> 42:16.726
He could freeze to death!

42:16.810 --> 42:19.396
You've got your own problems, Hal.

42:22.691 --> 42:27.404
Ryan, get a rope.
I want this dog on a leash too.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.866
Tie it. It better hold.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.795
Forget me.
It you can, get away.

42:44.878 --> 42:46.463
Would you?

42:49.675 --> 42:51.593
Go fetch, wonder dog.

43:13.948 --> 43:15.908
Move it, Walker.

43:19.328 --> 43:22.623
Keep it taut.
Ryan, keep it taut!

43:25.668 --> 43:29.255
Hal, come in please.
Hal, come in please. Over.

43:54.488 --> 43:56.114
I don't trust him.

44:30.356 --> 44:31.941
Damn.

44:38.072 --> 44:40.366
I don't think
we need two guides.

44:41.701 --> 44:44.036
Retire him when he comes down.

44:44.078 --> 44:47.623
They're going to kill you!
Don't come down!

44:47.707 --> 44:49.792
Pull the rope. Pull the rope!

44:52.336 --> 44:54.879
Pull, goddamn it! Pull!

45:00.218 --> 45:02.762
- Come on! Pull!
- Pull it!

45:06.057 --> 45:07.475
Pull, goddamn it!

45:07.559 --> 45:09.144
Ow!

45:25.827 --> 45:27.037
Watch it!

45:28.413 --> 45:30.539
- Get him!
- No!

45:30.622 --> 45:32.249
Do it.

46:53.036 --> 46:56.456
Your friend just had
the most expensive funeral in history.

46:56.498 --> 46:58.709
Now it's only you.

46:58.792 --> 47:01.294
Come in, Rescue Unit. Come in.

47:01.378 --> 47:04.589
Hal, what's going on? Hal?

47:04.673 --> 47:06.174
Talk.

47:06.258 --> 47:09.177
No messages, no codes,
no tricks.

47:09.261 --> 47:12.389
You haven't found us.
It was a take call.

47:13.473 --> 47:15.599
Jessie, I've just reached
the top of the tower.

47:15.683 --> 47:18.019
So far,
there's no sign of anyone.

47:18.060 --> 47:20.521
Looks like a phony call. Over.

47:20.563 --> 47:24.608
You've got to be kidding me. Do you
want me to fly up after you? Over.

47:24.692 --> 47:27.111
No. Negative.
The winds are still too high.

47:27.194 --> 47:29.530
I'm going to ride out
the storm up here.

47:29.572 --> 47:32.658
We'll take shelter
at the old Doug...

47:32.700 --> 47:34.368
Hal, I'm losing you.
Come in.

47:34.452 --> 47:36.579
Come in, Hal. Over.

47:36.662 --> 47:39.498
Go on to the next case.

47:42.209 --> 47:46.005
He said the tower,
but he's on Comb Bluff.

47:46.047 --> 47:49.341
Frank, fly me to the west valley.
The winds are never too strong there.

47:49.383 --> 47:51.760
It's only a half-hour climb
to the Douglas Shaft.

47:51.843 --> 47:54.220
It's the only shelter around.
Hal would have to go there.

47:54.262 --> 47:57.891
- Jessie, that is a bad idea.
- Please, Frank.

47:57.974 --> 48:00.977
If I don't find him,
you can come pick me up by nightfall.

48:01.061 --> 48:03.104
Hal would have my head.

48:03.188 --> 48:06.066
And it's such a handsome head.

48:08.401 --> 48:10.737
Please, Frank.

48:10.779 --> 48:13.073
I'll buy one of your paintings.

48:22.749 --> 48:24.376
Hold up!

48:26.460 --> 48:29.171
Where is it?

48:35.094 --> 48:37.429
There. On top of the peak.

48:37.471 --> 48:39.264
- Come on.
- Hold it.

48:41.350 --> 48:43.477
Looks like a winding route to me.

48:45.479 --> 48:48.649
The fastest way is
straight up the east face.

48:48.732 --> 48:51.777
Of course, there are only 12 guys
in the world who could do it.

48:51.860 --> 48:53.487
You want to try it?

50:38.381 --> 50:41.008
Gabe. What's happened?

50:41.092 --> 50:43.969
Oh, my God. You're frozen.
Come sit down.

50:44.053 --> 50:48.139
Gabe, where's your pack, your sweater?
Talk to me. What happened?

50:48.223 --> 50:49.683
They got Hal.

50:49.724 --> 50:52.352
The distress call was a fake.

50:53.853 --> 50:56.231
Fake? What do you mean
it was fake?

50:56.314 --> 51:00.151
Before they crashed,
they dumped cases of money.

51:00.235 --> 51:02.237
- Who's they?
- I don't know.

51:02.320 --> 51:05.699
They're using Hal to find it.
When they do, he's dead.

51:05.740 --> 51:08.576
You gotta get on the radio
and call Frank...

51:08.660 --> 51:12.497
and tell him to call
the state police.

51:12.580 --> 51:15.500
The cold killed my radio,
but Frank's gonna be looking for me.

51:15.583 --> 51:18.253
- We'll contact them from the chopper.
- The sun goes down in an hour.

51:18.336 --> 51:20.255
What do you want me to do?

51:21.339 --> 51:23.757
Let's take everything we need.
Let's move.

51:23.841 --> 51:26.218
We got to get to that next case
before they do.

51:31.807 --> 51:33.267
We're close!

51:33.308 --> 51:36.270
- It's just up there!
- It better be.

51:37.521 --> 51:41.316
You know something? I'm getting
real fucking tired of your threats.

51:41.400 --> 51:42.985
Are you?

52:20.480 --> 52:22.065
It's there.

52:34.576 --> 52:37.496
Oh, my God.
What do we do now?

52:37.537 --> 52:39.122
You got a pencil?

53:22.206 --> 53:23.833
Over here.

53:45.603 --> 53:47.188
Goddamn.

53:49.065 --> 53:51.693
The son of a bitch
is still alive!

53:57.824 --> 54:00.243
I'm beginning to dislike
this Mr. Walker.

54:02.412 --> 54:05.248
He can't be tar.
Find him. Go.

54:27.561 --> 54:29.146
Go.

55:09.227 --> 55:10.144
Come on.

55:24.701 --> 55:26.160
Give me a flare.

55:27.704 --> 55:29.664
- Meet me at Eagle's Cape.
- I'm not leaving.

55:29.706 --> 55:31.666
Don't worry about me!

56:52.077 --> 56:53.995
Gravity's a bitch, isn't it?

56:54.079 --> 56:56.414
Fuck the money, and fuck you!

56:56.456 --> 56:59.000
I wasn't born to die
on a mountain.

56:59.084 --> 57:01.378
Where were you born to die?
Got a place picked out?

57:01.419 --> 57:04.089
I don't need to hear
that shit from you, boy.

57:04.172 --> 57:07.008
Maybe this boy should make
this big mouth bigger.

57:07.092 --> 57:09.094
Stop this!

57:09.177 --> 57:11.930
The fight’s not here.
It's out there.

57:16.101 --> 57:18.019
Find us some shelter.

57:26.652 --> 57:28.987
Next time you're, like,
watching MTV, you know...

57:29.071 --> 57:32.449
take a split second
and flip it to the Weather Channel.

57:32.491 --> 57:35.494
I mean, hey, where would you
rather be right now?

57:35.577 --> 57:38.872
Here in tent city, or at home
playing some righteous air hockey?

57:38.956 --> 57:40.874
Air hockey's definitely
got my vote.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.877
Exactly, cheesehead,
exactly.

57:43.961 --> 57:45.879
- Cheesehead?
- Cheesehead.

57:51.093 --> 57:53.554
- He was here.
- What was in there?

57:53.637 --> 57:55.763
Answer the man.

57:55.847 --> 57:59.142
- Nothing. Just tourist souvenirs.
- Or equipment.

57:59.183 --> 58:02.103
Maybe Walker plans
to look after his friend here.

58:02.145 --> 58:04.147
He's not my friend...

58:04.188 --> 58:07.483
and I don't like him
any more than I do you.

58:07.567 --> 58:09.694
Nice try.

58:09.777 --> 58:13.531
But I never underestimate the power
of loyalty when it comes naturally.

58:14.657 --> 58:17.577
Not like the kind
that has to be paid for.

58:19.120 --> 58:20.455
Make a tire.

58:23.791 --> 58:26.294
It costs a fortune
to heat this place.

58:28.838 --> 58:30.797
That's bad humor, I know.

58:38.847 --> 58:41.850
We better get some sleep.
We're gonna need it.

58:55.197 --> 58:57.783
Rescue units, come in.

58:57.866 --> 59:00.911
Again, do you read? Come in.

59:00.994 --> 59:04.206
What the hell
is going on up there?

59:04.247 --> 59:05.539
Hal.

59:05.623 --> 59:08.584
Jessie, do you read?

59:08.668 --> 59:12.296
Jessie. It looks as if
we're drawing a crowd.

59:12.380 --> 59:15.341
We're down to a few hours before
the whole fucking world shows up.

59:15.424 --> 59:17.385
- Where's the next one?
- On the tower.

59:17.426 --> 59:18.886
How far?

59:20.137 --> 59:23.057
He asked how far, goddamn it!

59:23.099 --> 59:27.311
You know what I think? I think
you've been taking the scenic route.

59:27.395 --> 59:29.522
How far is it?

59:29.605 --> 59:31.607
Halt a day.

59:31.691 --> 59:35.069
- It's half a day.
- Hey, Hal!

59:35.111 --> 59:38.823
Check it out, man. It's Hal.
Hey, man, you stuck up here too?

59:38.906 --> 59:41.449
- You missed a great jump yesterday.
- Walk over.

59:41.533 --> 59:44.160
For Christ's sakes, man,
they're just kids.

59:44.244 --> 59:47.163
- Why don't you let them go?
- We're not animals.

59:47.247 --> 59:50.375
Don't force us to be.
Walk over.

59:51.459 --> 59:54.504
Hey, man, was that storm
a real bummer or what?

59:54.587 --> 59:56.506
Me and him were
in tent city last night.

59:57.590 --> 59:59.384
- Yeah.
- Hey, Hal.

59:59.426 --> 01:00:02.470
We're gonna take one last jump
and split.

01:00:02.554 --> 01:00:04.264
You baby-sitting hikers?

01:00:06.725 --> 01:00:08.893
- Run, man, run!
- What?

01:00:08.977 --> 01:00:10.562
Get the hell out...

01:00:39.465 --> 01:00:41.717
Son of a bitch.
You didn't have to kill him!

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.260
Shut up!

01:00:44.428 --> 01:00:46.180
Sue me.

01:00:49.475 --> 01:00:50.893
Fuck.

01:01:22.006 --> 01:01:23.132
Shoot him!

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:25.927
Shoot him!

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:28.845
You're letting him get away!
Shoot him!

01:01:49.533 --> 01:01:51.493
Shit. Ow!

01:01:56.331 --> 01:01:57.874
You murdering motherfuck.

01:01:59.001 --> 01:02:01.211
Kill a few people,
they call you a murderer.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.339
Kill a million,
and you're a conqueror.

01:02:05.381 --> 01:02:07.216
Go figure.

01:02:07.299 --> 01:02:10.469
Move on, Tucker.
Time is short.

01:02:56.598 --> 01:02:58.850
Okay. Just like you said.

01:02:58.933 --> 01:03:01.394
He's taking them the long way around.

01:03:01.436 --> 01:03:04.397
To stay ahead of them, we're gonna
have to go through that crack.

01:03:08.068 --> 01:03:10.236
You said there was a way across.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.655
There is.

01:03:11.738 --> 01:03:13.530
- Where the fuck is it?
- There.

01:03:13.614 --> 01:03:15.032
You blind?

01:03:17.785 --> 01:03:20.954
Hell with the money.
Radio the chopper.

01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.875
You just don't get it, do you?

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:29.171
We're in bed now, joined at the hip,
partners in crime.

01:03:30.798 --> 01:03:35.302
You've crossed over, Travers,
and there's no crossing back.

01:03:57.824 --> 01:04:00.201
All right,
that'll keep it dry.

01:04:08.126 --> 01:04:10.670
Okay, let's do it.

01:04:14.799 --> 01:04:16.801
Get a good tooting.

01:04:18.428 --> 01:04:20.388
Okay.

01:04:26.518 --> 01:04:28.437
It's slick, Jess.

01:04:31.732 --> 01:04:33.942
Good foothold.

01:05:06.891 --> 01:05:09.518
Jessie, don't move.

01:05:12.104 --> 01:05:14.065
Oh, my God.

01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:18.527
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

01:05:20.863 --> 01:05:22.782
Jessie, you gotta get down!

01:05:22.865 --> 01:05:24.283
Come on!

01:05:26.243 --> 01:05:27.411
Get down!

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:30.498
Stay close to me.

01:05:34.543 --> 01:05:37.212
All right, get down.

01:05:37.253 --> 01:05:38.505
Hold on to me.

01:05:40.507 --> 01:05:42.300
It's on my back!

01:05:49.724 --> 01:05:51.226
Let's get out!

01:05:53.103 --> 01:05:55.814
It's off your back.
There's nothing on your back.

01:05:55.897 --> 01:05:57.357
It's okay.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:04.990
Rocky Mountain Rescue Center,
this is Rescue 3. Over.

01:06:06.491 --> 01:06:09.202
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Go ahead.

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:13.372
The vis is good. I've got
at least 20 miles in all directions.

01:06:13.455 --> 01:06:16.250
If anyone's out here,
I'll find them. Over.

01:06:16.291 --> 01:06:18.293
Roger, 3. Center out.

01:06:30.014 --> 01:06:31.724
Center, this is 3.

01:06:31.807 --> 01:06:35.227
I've picked up a signal on the thermal
imager just north of Comb Bluff.

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:37.271
Landing to investigate.

01:07:24.358 --> 01:07:27.402
Get out! Get out of here!

01:07:29.071 --> 01:07:31.573
Get the hell out!

01:07:36.161 --> 01:07:37.579
Jesus Christ.

01:07:41.166 --> 01:07:44.252
Here, I got you.
I got you.

01:07:44.336 --> 01:07:47.422
I got you, son. I got you.

01:07:47.506 --> 01:07:49.925
There's the opening.

01:07:50.008 --> 01:07:52.844
When I get up there,
I'll hook up the line...

01:07:52.886 --> 01:07:54.680
and you follow me up.

01:07:54.721 --> 01:07:57.264
- Okay?
- All right.

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:09.110
- The other one is following.
- I'll move to a high point, flank him.

01:08:09.193 --> 01:08:11.570
Don't kill him
until you get the money.

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.072
Sure.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:21.037
Mr. Wright, we found the I. D.
on the dead pilot.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.249
He was known to fly for Qualen.
Over.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.626
What about the Treasury jet?
Over.

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:27.712
Its wreckage is scattered
over a two-mile area.

01:08:27.795 --> 01:08:30.089
No bodies have been found.
Over.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:34.175
Finally. An F. A. A. satellite
has located a downed aircraft.

01:08:34.259 --> 01:08:38.263
Head 110 miles south-southwest
of the park entrance.

01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:41.683
Treasury Control, get
the rescue people on their way.

01:08:41.765 --> 01:08:44.102
We're headed straight there.
One out.

01:08:44.144 --> 01:08:45.562
Center out.

01:09:10.794 --> 01:09:13.171
I got it, Jess.

01:09:13.255 --> 01:09:15.924
We're almost out.
I can chop through.

01:09:44.202 --> 01:09:45.536
Jessie, come on up!

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.037
Okay!

01:09:53.377 --> 01:09:54.671
Walker.

01:09:54.754 --> 01:09:57.465
Small world, ain't it?

01:09:57.548 --> 01:09:59.592
Don't even think about it.

01:10:01.135 --> 01:10:03.096
Your life’s on sale, Walker.

01:10:03.179 --> 01:10:04.931
The price is 30 million.

01:10:05.014 --> 01:10:07.725
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

01:10:08.851 --> 01:10:11.813
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where's the money?

01:10:11.854 --> 01:10:14.732
I burned it.
Never could save anything.

01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:19.611
Not even a dumb mountain boy like you
would burn $30 million.

01:10:20.404 --> 01:10:23.115
I don't make deals, Walker,
but I'll make one with you.

01:10:23.198 --> 01:10:26.743
Hand over the money, and I'll
just kill you and not the girl.

01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:29.538
Give me the money!

01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:35.460
Gabe?

01:10:37.212 --> 01:10:38.672
All right.

01:10:55.021 --> 01:10:57.648
Come on. Come on!

01:10:57.732 --> 01:10:59.191
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

01:10:59.233 --> 01:11:01.277
Kynette, what's going on?
Where's the money?

01:11:02.945 --> 01:11:05.364
- He said he torched it.
- Where is he now?

01:11:05.406 --> 01:11:07.033
He dropped down into some cave.

01:11:08.075 --> 01:11:09.994
You've had your chance.
Move it out now.

01:11:10.077 --> 01:11:11.871
- Kristel, get the C-4.
- Roger.

01:11:11.912 --> 01:11:13.914
Just give me five minutes.

01:11:13.998 --> 01:11:16.751
I said get the fuck out of there.

01:11:16.834 --> 01:11:20.004
Good. And blow up that black bastard
while you're at it.

01:11:20.087 --> 01:11:22.631
Save me the time
of doing it meself.

01:11:41.524 --> 01:11:45.236
It you want me, I'll be here!

01:11:50.825 --> 01:11:52.786
I'm in here!

01:12:04.839 --> 01:12:06.799
I'm in here.

01:12:11.845 --> 01:12:13.472
You're making it too easy for me.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.623
No bullets, bitch!

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:52.760
Now, I'm gonna ask you just three times:
where's the money?

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:57.724
Sissy.

01:12:57.807 --> 01:12:59.392
You hit like a sissy.

01:13:01.519 --> 01:13:04.856
Wrong answer, motherfucker!

01:13:07.358 --> 01:13:09.277
Get up!

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.322
Now, I'm gonna ask you
for a second time.

01:13:12.363 --> 01:13:14.866
Where is the money?

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:17.909
Burned it.

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:19.953
Wrong answer!

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:31.423
Time to kill a mountain man.

01:13:36.428 --> 01:13:40.432
It amazes me, in this day and age,
when a man...

01:13:40.515 --> 01:13:42.559
will put money...

01:13:42.643 --> 01:13:44.895
before the personal safety...

01:13:44.936 --> 01:13:48.190
of himself and his bitch.

01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:55.112
At least you can go
to your grave knowing...

01:13:55.196 --> 01:13:57.490
that I'm gonna treat the bitch...

01:13:58.574 --> 01:14:00.201
right!

01:14:18.928 --> 01:14:22.223
Are you okay? Oh, God!
I thought he killed you!

01:14:23.432 --> 01:14:26.268
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

01:14:29.354 --> 01:14:32.357
Hal, Jessie, do you read?

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.567
Again, do you read?
Come in.

01:14:36.528 --> 01:14:38.780
Hal, Jessie, what the hell's
goin' on up there?

01:14:38.863 --> 01:14:41.116
Jessie, find it.

01:14:54.587 --> 01:14:55.922
It's ready.

01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.551
Rescue 1, Rescue 2.

01:14:59.634 --> 01:15:02.095
- Do you copy? Over.
- Here it is!

01:15:02.928 --> 01:15:05.222
I found Evan in the east valley.

01:15:05.306 --> 01:15:07.224
He's got a gunshot wound
in the back.

01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:10.853
He's en route to the medical center
in Granby in critical condition.

01:15:10.936 --> 01:15:14.565
In case you can hear this,
I'm resuming my search.

01:15:14.648 --> 01:15:15.816
Come on!

01:15:18.444 --> 01:15:21.280
You'll make somebody
a fine wife someday.

01:15:23.991 --> 01:15:25.367
You should see me bake a cake.

01:15:39.172 --> 01:15:42.550
He's still alive,
for another four minutes.

01:15:42.634 --> 01:15:45.511
- Where's it set?
- Primed to go off right over his head.

01:15:46.387 --> 01:15:48.473
Fuck!

01:15:50.183 --> 01:15:52.185
Gabe, three minutes!
There's a bomb!

01:15:52.268 --> 01:15:55.688
Get the hell out of there!
There's a bomb over your head!

01:15:58.608 --> 01:16:00.985
Jessie, get the gear!

01:16:07.492 --> 01:16:10.411
Come on, Jessie. This way.

01:16:10.495 --> 01:16:13.289
That charge is gonna cause a landslide.
We gotta get to the west face.

01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:19.419
Why the hell are we wasting time?

01:16:19.503 --> 01:16:22.339
Making sure he's not
going to find that last case.

01:16:27.135 --> 01:16:29.054
You want to kill me,
don't you, Tucker?

01:16:30.263 --> 01:16:32.641
Well, take a number
and get in line.

01:16:37.354 --> 01:16:40.440
The ledge is too far. Take this rope
and pull it apart and tie it together.

01:16:40.524 --> 01:16:42.734
- We're gonna rappel down.
- This rope is 60 years old.

01:16:42.818 --> 01:16:44.653
- Will it hold?
- Don't think so.

01:16:44.736 --> 01:16:45.862
Bad answer.

01:17:00.876 --> 01:17:02.795
Frank! Frank!

01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:07.383
- No, Frank!
- He can't see you.

01:17:07.466 --> 01:17:09.385
Go!

01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:27.861
Here comes our ride. Move.

01:17:29.571 --> 01:17:32.157
Okay, now, swing as hard
as you can. Push!

01:18:20.079 --> 01:18:21.205
Jump.

01:19:17.884 --> 01:19:20.762
Frank! Frank! Frank!

01:19:55.087 --> 01:19:57.923
What's happening here?
Where's the rest of the group?

01:19:59.592 --> 01:20:01.218
Welcome.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.803
What are you doing?

01:20:02.887 --> 01:20:04.639
Now, back off!

01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:07.850
I came here to help you.

01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:09.977
You did.

01:20:10.061 --> 01:20:11.771
Don't move.

01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:18.235
- Frank! Frank!
- Better hurry, Tucker.

01:20:20.404 --> 01:20:21.822
Get out of here!

01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:46.805
You stupid maniac!

01:20:46.888 --> 01:20:50.266
- No one told you to shoot.
- We've wasted enough time.

01:20:50.308 --> 01:20:51.768
Frank?

01:21:06.115 --> 01:21:08.242
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:21:15.416 --> 01:21:17.918
This man never hurt anybody!

01:21:19.336 --> 01:21:21.380
Touching.

01:21:21.463 --> 01:21:23.841
Kristel, check the chopper.
Let's go.

01:21:52.035 --> 01:21:53.995
Get back! Get back!

01:21:54.037 --> 01:21:56.914
Go! Jessie, run!

01:22:15.891 --> 01:22:17.809
That son of a bitch.

01:22:19.519 --> 01:22:23.273
All right. We use a chopper
to locate the third case.

01:22:23.357 --> 01:22:26.234
- Then we get the hell out of here.
- No.

01:22:26.276 --> 01:22:28.445
There's not enough fuel
to search around.

01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:30.405
Just enough to get us down.

01:22:30.447 --> 01:22:32.824
You're not running things,
Travers.

01:22:33.909 --> 01:22:36.828
As soon as he finds the money,
you're as dead as me.

01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:41.541
Give me the monitor.

01:22:41.625 --> 01:22:43.001
Now.

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:59.934
- What's the code, Travers?
- I told you, Qualen.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:03.270
Fifty thousand possible
key code combinations...

01:23:03.354 --> 01:23:05.272
in 15-second intervals.

01:23:06.107 --> 01:23:08.651
So, what's the fucking code?

01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:18.202
Well, look
what Agent Travers found.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:20.203
I guess he is running things
after all.

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:22.247
Isn't he?

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:27.043
So what's the plan, Travers?
We use the chopper to find the money.

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:28.211
Right?

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:32.007
What a good idea.

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:34.676
But then again...

01:23:34.759 --> 01:23:37.637
without a pilot...

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:40.140
nobody even gets off
this mountain.

01:23:41.474 --> 01:23:43.393
What are you doing, Eric?

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:47.856
Do you know what
real love is, Kristel?

01:23:51.484 --> 01:23:52.902
Sacrifice.

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:07.791
Now I'm the only one
who can fly us out of here.

01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:10.002
We're partners again.

01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:13.964
Now, take your toy...

01:24:14.006 --> 01:24:16.342
and find our money.

01:24:18.636 --> 01:24:20.304
Radio when you find it.

01:24:22.514 --> 01:24:24.433
I'm waiting here.

01:24:33.358 --> 01:24:35.777
All right, the last of the money's
at Crockett River.

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.112
If we take the northern ridge,
we can get there first.

01:24:38.196 --> 01:24:42.033
There is no "we." I'm gonna go along
the north trail to Bitker Ladder.

01:24:42.075 --> 01:24:44.118
You go on to the station
for help.

01:24:44.202 --> 01:24:47.664
- Are you crazy?
- It they find the money, Hal's dead.

01:24:47.747 --> 01:24:49.916
- Just get back there fast.
- All right.

01:24:49.999 --> 01:24:53.670
Roger, Control. But where the hell
are those National Guard choppers?

01:24:53.711 --> 01:24:55.922
They had a mechanical, sir.
It's being worked on now.

01:24:56.005 --> 01:24:59.175
- Their E. T. A. is one hour.
- An hour?

01:24:59.217 --> 01:25:02.136
You got to do better than that.
Now, get a move on. Out.

01:26:27.636 --> 01:26:28.928
Stop there.

01:26:32.766 --> 01:26:34.768
We're close.

01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:37.604
I got it locked in.

01:26:37.687 --> 01:26:40.899
So we're finished
with him, yeah?

01:26:40.982 --> 01:26:43.443
Yeah. Do it quietly.

01:26:43.526 --> 01:26:45.862
Your insane boss
just made enough noise...

01:26:45.945 --> 01:26:48.573
for anyone within ten miles
to hear us.

01:26:51.534 --> 01:26:53.494
It's been fun.

01:26:58.874 --> 01:27:00.834
Hey, Delmar.

01:27:01.877 --> 01:27:04.588
From me to you...

01:27:04.672 --> 01:27:07.132
you're an asshole.

01:27:07.216 --> 01:27:08.717
Yeah?

01:27:08.801 --> 01:27:11.679
And you're a loudmouth,
punk slag...

01:27:11.762 --> 01:27:14.306
who's about to die.

01:27:14.348 --> 01:27:15.474
Maybe.

01:27:17.059 --> 01:27:20.062
But in a minute I'll be dead.

01:27:20.145 --> 01:27:22.022
You...

01:27:22.064 --> 01:27:23.941
will always be an asshole.

01:27:24.024 --> 01:27:27.069
So go ahead and shoot.

01:27:27.152 --> 01:27:28.903
I'm getting cold.

01:27:32.949 --> 01:27:34.492
Shoot!

01:27:36.869 --> 01:27:38.496
Who's shooting?

01:27:44.585 --> 01:27:46.170
Tell me...

01:27:46.212 --> 01:27:48.506
do you like soccer?

01:27:48.548 --> 01:27:50.091
It's a great sport.

01:27:50.174 --> 01:27:54.971
I was a fucking good striker.
Isn't that something?

01:28:05.564 --> 01:28:08.191
Oh, God!

01:28:08.233 --> 01:28:09.568
Fuck you!

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:11.695
Ah, you're swearing now.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:16.700
That's a penalty kick
for unsportsmanlike.

01:28:21.872 --> 01:28:23.248
A lovely little chip shot.

01:28:25.834 --> 01:28:28.629
He dribbles past one defender...

01:28:28.712 --> 01:28:31.048
two defenders...

01:28:31.089 --> 01:28:32.549
three defenders.

01:28:40.306 --> 01:28:42.475
Striker lines up
at the penalty spot.

01:28:42.558 --> 01:28:44.685
He focuses on the ball.

01:28:44.769 --> 01:28:46.687
The crowd is on its feet.

01:28:46.771 --> 01:28:49.231
Striker moves to his left.

01:28:49.273 --> 01:28:51.525
He draws back his foot.

01:28:51.609 --> 01:28:52.902
He comes in.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.923
Season's over, asshole!

01:29:22.806 --> 01:29:25.433
I said quietly.

01:29:57.423 --> 01:29:59.967
What the fuck is going on?

01:30:02.011 --> 01:30:03.971
This is not right.

01:30:18.527 --> 01:30:19.987
Fuck!

01:30:38.504 --> 01:30:40.506
Goddamn.

01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:42.967
Fuck you, Walker!

01:30:46.679 --> 01:30:48.931
Fucker!

01:30:57.065 --> 01:30:59.150
Goddamn it!

01:31:02.903 --> 01:31:04.863
Come in, goddamn it.

01:31:07.115 --> 01:31:09.076
Have you got what we need?

01:31:09.117 --> 01:31:12.537
It's Walker. The son of a bitch
is still alive, Qualen.

01:31:12.579 --> 01:31:14.539
No names.
This is an open line.

01:31:14.581 --> 01:31:17.125
I don't give a shit,
Eric Qualen!

01:31:18.752 --> 01:31:20.754
Had to be insane to tie up...

01:31:20.796 --> 01:31:23.882
with a lowlife piece of shit
like you anyway.

01:31:23.924 --> 01:31:25.050
They beat us.

01:31:26.426 --> 01:31:30.180
A couple of fucking
mountain rangers beat us.

01:31:30.263 --> 01:31:34.142
Jesus Christ, that's Travers.
Get a bead on that frequency.

01:31:34.226 --> 01:31:37.520
They beat the man
no law agency ever could.

01:31:37.603 --> 01:31:38.854
Get off the radio.

01:31:38.938 --> 01:31:41.857
And I'm finding that
pretty fuckin' hilarious, Qualen.

01:31:41.941 --> 01:31:44.151
Stop transmitting,
you stupid bastard!

01:31:44.235 --> 01:31:47.238
It's hard to believe I sold out
after 20 years...

01:31:47.321 --> 01:31:49.782
and this is my payback?

01:31:49.824 --> 01:31:53.327
To run on a mountain
with a fuckin' dirtbag like you!

01:31:53.411 --> 01:31:55.538
Travers, you've lost your mind.

01:31:56.622 --> 01:31:58.833
Lost it. Have I lost it?

01:31:58.916 --> 01:32:02.628
Fuckin' A, I've lost it, Qualen!
Pure, fuckin' section eight!

01:32:04.588 --> 01:32:06.674
I gotta go.

01:32:06.757 --> 01:32:09.468
I'm on my last official manhunt.

01:32:10.553 --> 01:32:12.470
Adiós, motherfucker!

01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:22.314
You got a bearing
on that frequency yet?

01:32:23.523 --> 01:32:26.234
Yes. Eight minutes away.

01:32:44.502 --> 01:32:46.463
You're dead, Walker!

01:33:42.225 --> 01:33:43.393
Frank!

01:35:21.988 --> 01:35:23.448
I won, Walker!

01:35:41.716 --> 01:35:43.176
Gabe!

01:36:05.572 --> 01:36:07.533
Travers, come in.

01:36:12.663 --> 01:36:16.041
Compliments of Delmar.
Too late. You missed him.

01:36:16.083 --> 01:36:18.669
He decided to take a swim
to Arizona.

01:36:18.752 --> 01:36:21.629
- Tucker.
- That's right.

01:36:22.547 --> 01:36:24.716
Congratulations.

01:36:24.799 --> 01:36:25.883
Qualen?

01:36:27.218 --> 01:36:29.137
It's all over.

01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:32.348
Walker. You resilient bastard.

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:35.101
So you're still alive.

01:36:35.184 --> 01:36:37.312
I want that money,
and I want it now.

01:36:37.395 --> 01:36:39.856
Qualen, the game's over.

01:36:39.897 --> 01:36:41.024
You lost.

01:36:41.065 --> 01:36:44.235
Oh, no. The game's
just getting interesting.

01:36:44.319 --> 01:36:46.279
I'm airborne now, you see.

01:36:47.989 --> 01:36:50.783
As a matter of tact,
I've picked up a passenger...

01:36:50.867 --> 01:36:52.577
you might be interested in.

01:36:54.912 --> 01:36:56.872
Go on, talk.

01:36:56.913 --> 01:36:59.166
I said talk, goddamn it!

01:37:01.168 --> 01:37:04.004
Hal, he's got me. I'm sorry.
I thought he was Frank.

01:37:04.087 --> 01:37:06.173
You get the picture, Walker?

01:37:06.256 --> 01:37:08.759
Now, I want that money.

01:37:08.842 --> 01:37:11.720
Meet me at the highest point
from where you are.

01:37:11.762 --> 01:37:14.473
It you don't,
we're going to find out...

01:37:14.556 --> 01:37:17.434
it this little angel of yours
can fly.

01:37:18.644 --> 01:37:21.313
Jessie, take him to the highest point
near Bitker Ladder.

01:37:21.396 --> 01:37:24.483
I'll meet you there.
Don't worry.

01:37:24.566 --> 01:37:26.735
Love's a killer, isn't it?

01:37:42.291 --> 01:37:45.503
- Where are you, Walker?
- You're getting warmer. Keep climbing.

01:37:46.921 --> 01:37:48.673
You're getting closer.

01:37:48.756 --> 01:37:50.716
Look out.

01:38:08.525 --> 01:38:11.111
I must admit,
you're a real piece of work.

01:38:11.194 --> 01:38:13.947
Yeah, and I must admit,
you're a real piece of shit.

01:38:24.124 --> 01:38:26.084
Throw it up, or I'll kill her.

01:38:26.167 --> 01:38:29.170
You do, and the cash is gone.

01:38:29.254 --> 01:38:32.924
- The money.
- I want you to put her down.

01:38:33.008 --> 01:38:34.426
Over there!

01:39:28.478 --> 01:39:29.938
Jessie, run!

01:39:30.021 --> 01:39:32.231
- What about you?
- Run!

01:39:33.566 --> 01:39:34.984
Run!

01:39:36.861 --> 01:39:38.112
Come on, Qualen.

01:39:38.196 --> 01:39:41.366
I got what you want.
Come on.

01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:51.751
Come on. Come and get it.

01:39:56.672 --> 01:39:58.590
Come on. Closer.

01:39:59.675 --> 01:40:02.094
Come on, closer.

01:40:02.135 --> 01:40:04.388
- A little closer, Qualen.
- Throw it in.

01:40:04.429 --> 01:40:06.348
Bring it closer.

01:40:07.432 --> 01:40:08.558
Oh, my God.

01:40:15.857 --> 01:40:17.442
Throw it in.

01:40:34.583 --> 01:40:36.544
Damn you, Walker!

01:40:53.227 --> 01:40:54.395
Run!

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.144
Jessie, move!

01:41:47.029 --> 01:41:48.155
Come on.

01:42:28.111 --> 01:42:31.447
It's just us now,
you piece of shit.

01:42:46.337 --> 01:42:48.673
Watch out!

01:42:48.756 --> 01:42:50.716
Get out of there, man!

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.388
Stick around.

01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:01.435
We had a deal...

01:43:01.518 --> 01:43:03.979
and now we've
just got each other.

01:43:05.188 --> 01:43:07.357
You're not afraid to die.

01:43:12.779 --> 01:43:14.156
Come on, get him!

01:43:19.786 --> 01:43:20.537
Get out of there!

01:43:21.622 --> 01:43:23.081
Remember, shithead.

01:43:23.123 --> 01:43:25.750
Keep your arms and legs
in the vehicle...

01:43:25.791 --> 01:43:27.501
at all times!

01:43:48.147 --> 01:43:50.149
Give me the rope!

01:43:53.986 --> 01:43:55.446
Okay.

01:43:59.367 --> 01:44:00.785
I'm out of here.

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.727
Gabe, buddy, you think you could have
put a little less effort in that climb?

01:44:27.811 --> 01:44:30.480
I mean,
I thought you were in shape.

01:44:31.856 --> 01:44:33.858
- I guess I'm just falling apart.
- Yeah.

01:44:33.942 --> 01:44:35.652
This is Agent Wright. Copy?

01:44:35.694 --> 01:44:39.405
- Yeah, copy.
- Please identify yourselves. Over.

01:44:39.488 --> 01:44:42.074
Yeah, this is Hal Tucker,
Rocky Mountain Rescue.

01:44:42.157 --> 01:44:44.827
Hey, we're glad
to see you guys.

01:44:44.868 --> 01:44:46.829
If you're looking
for Mr. Qualen...

01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:49.957
try about 4,000 feet
south of here.

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:52.710
He'll be the one
wearing a helicopter. Over.

01:44:52.793 --> 01:44:54.295
Good.

01:44:54.378 --> 01:44:58.757
I'll arrange transportation for the
three of you. Sit tight for a while.
