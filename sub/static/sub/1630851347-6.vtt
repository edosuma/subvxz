00:03.771 --> 00:06.105
- lilly, is there something
else you want to say?

00:06.207 --> 00:07.406
- It was aaron and veronica.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.925
They took me.
She's not my sister.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.243
- Veronica, wait!

- You really think whoever's
on the other end of that

00:17.835 --> 00:19.585
can help us fix your plane?
- They flew down here.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.969
Maybe they have parts
we can use.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.287
Gavin's visions are real.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.156
Everything that he's seen
these past few years

00:24.241 --> 00:26.191
have been glimpses
of this world.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.960
- When will we leave?
- Tonight.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.611
- What is this place?

00:29.730 --> 00:32.197
- This is where the survivors
of the la brea sinkhole settled

00:32.299 --> 00:33.732

- eve. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Please. Whoa.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.979
Hey, can we talk about this?
- We already have.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.182
We both agreed that if things
weren't better by now,

01:23.284 --> 01:25.150
that the kids and I were gonna
spend the summer in la.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.752
- Okay, we did.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.054
But I changed my mind.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.890
- Gavin.

01:31.992 --> 01:32.925
- You're breaking up
our family?

01:33.027 --> 01:34.326
- Don't put this on me.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.696
You haven't been sober for over
a week in the last three years.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.631
The kids deserve better.
I deserve better.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.034
- You're--you're right.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.236
Just--just tell me
what I have to do.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.370
Tell me what you need from me.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.539
- I need--

01:47.641 --> 01:49.341
I need my husband back.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.043
I need the man
I fell in love with.

01:51.145 --> 01:54.246
I need the--the person
who always made me feel safe.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.514
- I want that too.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.251
Eve, if I could just figure out
what these things are I see,

01:59.353 --> 02:03.021
why they're happening to me,
then I can turn it around.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.791
You just have to trust me.

02:05.893 --> 02:06.925
- I got to go.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.026
I got to go get the kids.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.331
- Hey.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.934
Eve, I'm gonna find my way
back to you.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.369
I promise.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.590
- Scott, what are you doing?

02:38.676 --> 02:40.943
- Trying to calculate how long
until that light's gone.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.295
- With your finger?
- Take a look.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.197
It started closing
about three hours ago, right?

02:45.299 --> 02:46.448
Well, since then,

02:46.567 --> 02:48.834
it's gotten smaller
by one of my fingernails.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.769
My index finger is
about seven fingernails long.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.839
So by that calculation,
we got about 18 hours left

02:53.974 --> 02:56.041
until we're stuck
down here forever.

02:56.126 --> 02:58.227
- I really wish
I hadn't asked.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.712
- So you're telling me
lilly was kidnapped?

03:00.814 --> 03:02.364
- That's right.

03:02.482 --> 03:03.899
- We have to talk to veronica.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.084
- I tried.
She ran off into the woods.

03:06.170 --> 03:07.986
And if she doesn't
come back soon,

03:08.088 --> 03:09.404
we have to go look for her.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.340
- Oh, hey.
You think that's a good idea?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.575
There's a seriously
pissed off group of locals

03:13.694 --> 03:15.060
who aren't happy
we're down here.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.695
- We can't just leave her
out there by herself.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.997
- I agree,
but right now,

03:19.083 --> 03:22.134
our top priority
needs to be getting home.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.635
- Mom.

Everyone's freaking out.

03:27.558 --> 03:28.590
What are we gonna do?

03:28.709 --> 03:29.908

03:30.044 --> 03:31.476
But we're not
gonna give up, okay?

03:31.579 --> 03:32.644
We're gonna find a way home.

03:35.415 --> 03:37.449
- What's going on?

03:37.534 --> 03:40.085
- [sighs]

03:40.187 --> 03:42.354
I wrote a letter
to your dad and izzy.

03:42.456 --> 03:46.992
And--and I buried it,
hoping they would find it,

03:47.077 --> 03:48.627
let everybody know we're alive,

03:48.729 --> 03:50.712
send another plane
before the portal closes.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.997
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.799
Um, josh, there's something
I need you to know

03:53.901 --> 03:56.802
about your dad
and the things he sees.

04:00.307 --> 04:04.243
They're real.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.345
And he can see us here.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.347
- You think dad can see us?

04:08.432 --> 04:09.615
- I know it's hard
to believe, but--

04:09.717 --> 04:10.649
- yeah, 'cause it's insane.

04:10.734 --> 04:12.884
- I thought so too.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.253
But it's true.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.587
- Even if it is,
when's the last time

04:15.689 --> 04:18.523
he came through for us
on anything?

04:20.711 --> 04:23.312

How are you gonna get there?

06:15.359 --> 06:16.358
- Compass and the stars.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.776
Just like they taught us
in basic.

it's mostly flat wetlands
to the ocean.

I'm levi, and this is eve.
We spoke on the walkie.

- What did you do to jonathan?
- We didn't do anything.

Diana, this is you
and the mojave team.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.384
- Where did you get that?

08:06.487 --> 08:09.087
- Dr. Sophia nathan
gave it to me.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.694
- Sorry.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.164
You spend enough time
down here,

08:19.266 --> 08:22.634
you learn to see everything
as a threat.

08:22.736 --> 08:26.004
- You said you might be able
to fix our plane.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.807
Do you think
it's still possible?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.308
- Maybe.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.476
Come with me.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.648
- I was told that you and your
team came through the mojave.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.216
How did you end up
in los angeles?

08:38.318 --> 08:39.918
- The portal
we came in through closed,

08:40.020 --> 08:41.920
so we went looking
for another way out.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.757
But we got caught in the storm,
crashed on the beach.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.493
Two of our crew died,
including our pilot.

08:48.595 --> 08:49.561
- What about
the rest of them?

08:49.646 --> 08:51.746
- We split up, trying
to find another way home.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.132
Eventually, jonathan and I
settled here.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.534
And when we saw
your plane come down,

08:55.636 --> 08:58.703
he went looking for you,
but he never came back.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.906
You said
your engine was damaged.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.440
Have you identified
the problem?

09:02.543 --> 09:04.175
- Bleeding air
from the compressor.

09:04.278 --> 09:05.377
- You check the axial?

09:05.479 --> 09:07.078
- Uh-huh.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.682
- Must be the pneumatic system.
That's good news.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.588
Ours is still intact.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.256

rebecca.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.718

how you did that?

09:46.820 --> 09:47.719
- Not really.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.020
And this is
private property,

09:49.122 --> 09:50.455
so I hope
you have a warrant.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.127
- I told you
to let this go.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.662

is closing.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.464

We've been tracking it.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.583

to save 'em.

10:09.076 --> 10:12.243
And trust me,
you're gonna wanna see this.

we already excavated.

just appeared?

10:26.526 --> 10:27.726
- What kind of wreckage?

10:27.827 --> 10:28.910
- A plane.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.873
- That's levi's plane.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.608
- Jesus, you're right.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.243
But he flew down
two days ago.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.479
Why did it just appear?
- Good question.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.748
Do we have gpr
in the area?

10:49.850 --> 10:51.216
- Yeah.

10:51.301 --> 10:53.551
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

10:53.654 --> 10:56.104

ground-penetrating radar.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.423
There are multiple bodies.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.992
- Levi must have tried
to fix the plane,

11:01.094 --> 11:02.527
tried to fly 'em home.

11:02.612 --> 11:03.828
But they didn't make it.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.196
- Dad.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.515
Dad, what if--what if
mom and josh were on it?

11:07.634 --> 11:08.833
What if we're too late?

11:08.935 --> 11:10.869
- Just yesterday,
I saw them alive, all right?

11:10.971 --> 11:13.004
Maybe they haven't left yet.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.806
I think we can still save 'em.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.641
Rebecca has a plane.

11:16.743 --> 11:17.609
You have to let me try.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.411
- Gavin, stop.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.580
Arrest him.
- What?

11:22.683 --> 11:23.882
- Hey. Get off!
Get off!

11:23.984 --> 11:25.283
- Stop. What are you doing?!
- Stand down.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.652
- Gavin, I'm sorry,
but if something goes wrong

11:27.754 --> 11:30.288
and there's another earthquake,
people will die.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.123
It's over, gavin.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.765
- Good morning.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.870
- Did veronica come back?

11:45.972 --> 11:46.938
- She didn't.

11:53.747 --> 11:57.849
You're, um, worried about her,
aren't you?

11:59.586 --> 12:03.388
- When aaron took me,
I was so scared.

12:03.490 --> 12:07.459
But veronica was nice to me.

12:07.561 --> 12:08.993
At night,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.996
he kept us
in a room together.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.632
She was the only person
I could talk to.

12:14.735 --> 12:15.700
- Lilly.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.607
Are you saying that
aaron kidnapped veronica too?

12:22.709 --> 12:25.543
- Yes.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.847
She's not a bad person.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.715
We need to find her, ty.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.885
[car approaching]

12:37.824 --> 12:39.190
- mom.
- Josh.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.895
Everybody, this is diana.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.730
- Good to meet you all.

12:47.834 --> 12:51.236
- So we have a chance
of getting out of here?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.571
- It's possible.
[cheers]

12:53.673 --> 12:55.039
- I knew I liked you
the moment you arrived.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.975
- Hold on.
I'm not making any promises.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.643
Diana's an engineer.
We're gonna head back

12:58.745 --> 12:59.978
to my plane,
see if we can get it going.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.480
I'm gonna grab some mres.
I'll be right back.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.048
- How long have you
been down here?

13:04.151 --> 13:07.118
- 1,123 days.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.453
Give or take a few.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.524
- Do you know how long we have
till light goes away?

13:12.626 --> 13:14.225
- The one that
I came in through,

13:14.327 --> 13:15.493
once it started to close,

13:15.595 --> 13:17.595
it was gone
in less than 24 hours.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.034
- That puts it
at nightfall.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.702
- All right.
We're ready.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.238
- Okay.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.107
- Plane's a lot closer
than the beach,

13:29.209 --> 13:30.475
so we shouldn't
have connection issues.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.810
- Good.
- I'll call you

13:31.912 --> 13:33.912
as soon
as we have any news.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.313
[engine starts]

13:41.221 --> 13:42.987
- look, I know
we're all anxious,

13:43.089 --> 13:44.455
but we need to be
prepared to leave

13:44.558 --> 13:46.291
as soon as levi says
his plane is ready.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.827
- Don't have to tell me twice.
I'll be ready to go.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.229
- Who says you're going first?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.731
- You trying to take my seat?
Go on.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.333
See where that gets you.
- Hey.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.202
I'm not getting left behind.
- All right, enough.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.103
Nobody said anything
about anyone being left behind.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.939
- Look, we need
to be smart about this.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.040
Fair.
- Sam's right.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.175
There's not enough room
for all of us on the plane,

14:04.277 --> 14:06.177
so we're gonna have
to take multiple trips.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.248
All right.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.783
I say we draw names.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.685
It's the best option
we have right now.

14:15.589 --> 14:18.423
- All right. Everybody
write down their name.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.991
We need to start picking now.

14:25.866 --> 14:26.965
- Hey.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.033
You okay, sweetheart?

14:29.135 --> 14:30.735
- Dad, if that light closes,

14:30.820 --> 14:33.371
mom and josh are
stuck down there forever.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.873
- I'm not gonna
let that happen.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.711
Aldridge, let me
ask you a question.

14:39.813 --> 14:42.413
How did you know
where the clearing was?

14:42.515 --> 14:45.083
- Gavin, that's not important
right now.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.517
- She's full of crap, dad.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.853
- This isn't
how I wanted it to go, izzy.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.022
- How did you want it to go?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.157
What else are you
hiding from us?

14:54.861 --> 14:55.960
[door beeps, unlocks]

14:58.164 --> 14:59.597
finally.
Where have you been?

14:59.699 --> 15:01.299
- Working on a way
to get you out of here.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.368
- How?
- Markman was onto me.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.303
I had to make him think
that I was on his side.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.905
- You were the one
who gave us up.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.340
- It was my only option.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.809
If I didn't,
they'd have rebecca's plane

15:11.912 --> 15:13.344
and we'd have no way
of getting down there.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.779
- So what's your play?

15:14.881 --> 15:16.981
- I told markman about
your compound in oregon.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.416
That's where he thinks
the plane is.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.817
- Well done.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.419
- How long until he figures out
it's not there?

15:21.521 --> 15:22.921
- A couple of hours.
And we need to get you

15:23.023 --> 15:24.355
to the ranch
before that happens.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.557
My car's not far from here,
and I can sneak you out.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.092
- My helicopter's ready to go.
- Hold on.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.961
I need to get word down
to eve and levi,

15:30.063 --> 15:31.562
tell them
his plane's gonna crash.

15:31.665 --> 15:32.997
- Gavin, there really
isn't any time left.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.365
- He could take off
at any moment.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.000
I have to warn them.

15:38.672 --> 15:41.773
There has to be a way
to get a message down there.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.747
- And the next one is...

15:49.849 --> 15:50.915
- Angela o'brien.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.083
- [sighs in relief]

15:52.185 --> 15:55.987
- okay. We got two more slots
for the first flight.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.189
Next one goes to...

15:58.291 --> 15:59.457
- Josh harris.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.526
- Seriously, I better be
in that seat next to you.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.427
- Yeah.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.095
- Come on.
- Come on.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.331
- And the last spot
goes to...

16:08.268 --> 16:10.001
Lucas hayes.
[all groan]

16:10.103 --> 16:12.070
- nice pick, eve.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.838
Much appreciated.
- No way. No way, nah.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.139
To hell with that.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.941
Yeah, I mean,
eve just chose her son.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.476
I say we start over, huh?
- Oh, come on.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.411
That's ridiculous.
- You want to start over?

16:20.513 --> 16:22.947
- No one is repicking anything.
- Shock you'd say that.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.148
Your son's
in the first flight too.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.284
- Look, this is
how we're doing it.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.653
It's not perfect, but
it's the only choice we have.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.222
Everyone just take five.
Go for a walk, grab a drink.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.807
Then we pick the next flight.

16:32.926 --> 16:35.927
[soft chatter]

16:37.397 --> 16:38.863
- eve.
- Ty.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.165
You going somewhere?
- Yeah.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.668
Veronica's gone missing.
I need to go and find out.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.838
- Ty, you can't do this alone.
You know it's too dangerous.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.840
- Look, I--I asked the guys
to look after lilly

16:48.942 --> 16:52.143
while I'm gone,
but if anything happens to me,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.412
I just want you to make sure
she gets back to her family.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.247
Okay?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.749
Goodbye, eve.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.117
Just take good care
of yourself, okay?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.019
- All right, listen,
if you don't find veronica

17:01.121 --> 17:03.488
in the next couple of hours,
you get back here.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.056
Do you hear me?
- Yes.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.558
- Okay. I'm gonna take
the last flight out.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.893
I'll save a seat for you.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.263
- All right.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.365
- Be careful.
- I will.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.737
[metal clangs]
- [gasps]

17:19.839 --> 17:21.439
- hey. Come on.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.207
- Wait, they're about
to pick the next flight.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.409
- They'll save your spot.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.877
I'm not leaving my stash
out there, man.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.378
It's worth too much.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
And don't tell me you don't
remember where you buried it.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.116
You smoke weed.
You don't have amnesia.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.451
Now which way did you go?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.203
- Well, it was that way,
but I don't really think--

17:35.321 --> 17:37.088
- okay, good.
Come on.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.539
We don't have much time.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.124
Let's go.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.873
- System's reading
the new compressor.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.642
- Looks good so far.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.310
- Just need a minute
to calibrate.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.363
- That's another 60 seconds
after all these years, right?

18:07.103 --> 18:07.985
You okay?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.922
- Yeah. I--I think
I just need a minute.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.269
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.604
- What's going on?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.439
- Anxious, I guess.

18:31.277 --> 18:35.713
You--you mentioned
sophia nathan.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.482
So you met her?

18:40.186 --> 18:42.787
How was she?

18:42.889 --> 18:46.958
I mean, did she seem well?

18:47.060 --> 18:48.226
- She did.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.098
You two were together?

18:54.184 --> 18:56.200
- We were engaged.

18:58.054 --> 19:01.539
These last few years, all I've
wanted is to get back to her.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.623
And now that I might--

19:02.742 --> 19:04.208
- you're afraid she moved on.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.781
- The day
before I came down here,

19:10.884 --> 19:12.450
we were making wedding plans.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.687
We were gonna get married
on the beach.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.993
I've thought
about that every day.

19:22.095 --> 19:25.029
- She probably has too.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.731
In my experience,
doesn't matter

19:26.816 --> 19:30.568
how long you've been away
from the person you love.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.271
Those feelings never change.

[plane engine starts]

19:38.077 --> 19:40.578

working just fine.

- What was that?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.898
- I think it's a drone.
It looks military.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.499
- Maybe instead of
crashing drones down here,

20:35.602 --> 20:37.235
they could actually
send some more help.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.903

21:35.895 --> 21:38.429

22:13.700 --> 22:15.333
- Dude, something just
fell out of the sky.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.934
Aren't you the least bit
curious about it?

22:17.036 --> 22:19.704
- No. Keep going.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.940
- Your mom's a cop.
I hear they get good pensions.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.709
Maybe can she give you
a loan or something?

22:24.811 --> 22:26.744
- Not an option.
- [sighs]

22:26.846 --> 22:29.613
- go on, then.
- Okay. Okay.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.415
Borrowing money from family
can be tricky.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.117
I get it.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.952
Clearly, you got a lot
to work out with your mom,

22:35.054 --> 22:37.154
I mean, with you being on the
other side of the law and all.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.622
Hey. No judgment here.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.324
I mean, I'm the black sheep
of my family too.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.859
Obviously,
for different reasons.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.694
- You think
I'm the black sheep?

22:43.796 --> 22:45.029
- Aren't you?

22:45.131 --> 22:48.165
- Let's just say,
what I do is family business.

22:48.267 --> 22:50.368
My dad and I,
we're partners.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.671
- Wait, you and your dad
are drug dealers?

22:53.773 --> 22:56.674
Wow. Your mom's, like,
the worst cop ever.

22:56.776 --> 23:00.845
- We're done talking.

23:00.947 --> 23:01.979
What are you doing?

23:04.751 --> 23:07.585
- Well, I was stoned when
I came out here the first time.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.186
Maybe if I got myself
in the same state of mind,

23:09.288 --> 23:10.921
I might remember something.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.758
- That's actually
not a bad idea.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.860
Do you mind if--
- of course.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.828
- Thanks.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.664
Stop being an idiot!

23:20.767 --> 23:22.433
- What the hell, man?

23:26.572 --> 23:28.139
Wait a minute.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.410
Hey, this is it.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.412
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.247
Yeah, I buried it
around here.

23:36.349 --> 23:38.349
I remember thinking it was
the spitting image of treebeard

23:38.451 --> 23:40.184
from the forest of fangorn.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.452
Look, whatever.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.120
The point is, man,
the weed worked.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.422
This is it.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.593
- Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.429
Your husband dug up wreckage
from a plane

23:51.531 --> 23:53.063
that hasn't even taken off yet.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.432
That is insane.

23:54.534 --> 23:57.435
- Yeah, but it doesn't mean
it's not true.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.669
And I trust him.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.872
- And what happens
if he doesn't make it?

24:01.974 --> 24:03.107
I just want to get home.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.442
- Yeah.
- We all want to get home.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.343
- I'm sorry, eve,
but they're right.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.813
- They found our plane, sam.
We can't ignore that.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.014
- We're not going to.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.282
Gavin's message
is the best thing

24:11.384 --> 24:12.550
that could have happened to us.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.984
Now diana and I
can go back

24:14.086 --> 24:15.419
and figure out
what went wrong.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.555
- No. That's still
too big of a risk.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.256
- The only risk is
if we do nothing.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.991
- I thought you were
on board with this.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.760
- I've been here
for three years.

24:22.845 --> 24:25.763
Everyone I came with is dead.
I'm not staying another day.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.233
- mom.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.902
They've got to try.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.004
- Now let's head back to the
plane, do a diagnostic check.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.639
- Tony, you drive them.

24:35.741 --> 24:37.775
We'll meet you back at the
clearing with the first group.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.009
- Okay.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.516
- Josh.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.184
I can't let you
get on that flight.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.053
- Mom, you heard uncle levi.
He can fix it.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.555
- And you heard your dad.
The plane is still gonna crash.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.290
- You honestly think
he's gonna make it down here?

24:53.392 --> 24:55.259
- Yes, I do.
He found my ring.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.827
He is the only reason
that people know

24:56.929 --> 24:58.662
we're still alive down here.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.598
Honey, I know the last
three years have been hard,

25:00.700 --> 25:02.666
but you have to remember
the person your dad was

25:02.768 --> 25:04.001
before his crash.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.670
- He's not that guy anymore.
- I didn't think so either.

25:06.772 --> 25:07.705
But that message,

25:08.724 --> 25:10.307
that's the guy that always
came through for us.

25:10.409 --> 25:12.843
He asked us to trust him.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.278
We have to do that.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.781
- You can trust him
all you want.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.183
I'm getting on that plane.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.201

26:04.263 --> 26:05.596
I go to jail?

26:05.698 --> 26:07.765
- Lilly told me the truth.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.467
That you were a victim,
same as her.

26:10.570 --> 26:11.902
- That's not true.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.771
My father was a good man.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.673
He set me free
from my old life.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.208

26:18.311 --> 26:19.977
You can finally go home.

- It's not.

Your family is still out there.

they haven't given up hope
of seeing you again.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.291
Neither should you.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.572

to say goodbye?

26:48.674 --> 26:51.542

me how wrong I am until now.

There are 30 people here

32:46.265 --> 32:47.664
it's got to be worth
millions, right?

32:50.336 --> 32:53.370
Dude, I'm rich!

32:53.472 --> 32:55.038
[cackles]
come on.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.373
Come on.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.345
- I went over the engine
three times.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.347
If there's something wrong,
I'm not seeing it.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.949
- I think I found something.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.484
Maybe it's not an engine issue.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.553
Was the bypass valve
open or closed?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.355
- Open. Why?

33:11.457 --> 33:13.023
- This says it's closed.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.391
The sensor must have
been damaged

33:14.493 --> 33:15.592
when the plane
hit the ground.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.194
The computer
would have automatically

33:17.296 --> 33:18.261
diverted power
to take off.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.498
- Destabilizing the engine
and causing it to crash.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.933
You're a genius,
you know that?

33:23.035 --> 33:24.701
[car approaching]

33:28.874 --> 33:30.607
- eve, where's tony?

33:30.709 --> 33:32.709
He was supposed
to bring people back.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.045
- Tony's not coming.
- Why not?

33:35.147 --> 33:36.813
- Levi, I can't
let you do this.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.415
- Eve, we figured out
what went wrong.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.750
You have to believe me.
It'll fly.

33:39.852 --> 33:41.184
- Why are we even
talking about this?

33:41.286 --> 33:43.987
We're ready to go.
- Change of plans.

33:44.073 --> 33:45.389
- Eve, what the hell is this?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.791
- Levi, everyone
on that flight will die,

33:47.893 --> 33:49.459
including you.

33:49.561 --> 33:52.562
We have to wait for gavin.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.432
- I'm sorry.
We're leaving.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.935
Head back to the clearing
and pick everyone up there.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.638
- Stop!
[gun cocks]

34:01.740 --> 34:04.508
- marybeth, what are you doing?
- What I have to.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.553
- Ten miles out.
- Okay.

34:18.257 --> 34:22.059
<i> - Gavin, do you copy?</i>

34:22.194 --> 34:23.493
- Yes, I copy.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.762
- I have two f-15s
heading your way.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.464
If you do not land
that plane immediately,

34:27.566 --> 34:29.166
they will shoot you down.

34:29.267 --> 34:30.534
- Oh, god.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.238
- My son is on
that first flight.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.441
So let's all just
get in the jeep.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.242
We'll talk about it
at the clearing.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.744
Hopefully, eve's husband
gets here soon,

34:40.846 --> 34:43.313
and we're all home
by dinner.

34:50.522 --> 34:53.356
- Gavin's not coming.
He sent that drone hours ago.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.192
He'd have been here by now.
- You don't know that.

34:55.294 --> 34:56.726
- I get that you want
to believe in him.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.696
This isn't gonna
change anything.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.531
- All right, enough.
Come on, guys. Let's go.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.966
- We're not going anywhere.
[gun cocks]

35:05.771 --> 35:08.205
- diana, put the gun down.
- No!

35:08.307 --> 35:11.575
- Diana, please.
- No!

35:11.677 --> 35:14.144
This is my last chance
to get home.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.213
- Put the gun down.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.581
Don't do this.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.483
[gunshot]

35:28.660 --> 35:29.893

You're gonna be okay.

35:29.995 --> 35:31.561
Diana.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.096
- We have to get her to sam.

35:33.198 --> 35:34.865
- Diana, you're gonna be fine.

35:34.967 --> 35:35.832
- [groans]

35:44.475 --> 35:45.809

35:46.578 --> 35:47.511

35:47.613 --> 35:49.813
- What happened?
- [groaning]

35:49.915 --> 35:51.681
- she took a shot,
I returned fire.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.216
- Riley,
get the first aid kit.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.085
Lay her flat.
- Okay. Okay.

35:55.187 --> 35:58.321
I'm gonna lay you down.
- Stay calm and breathe, okay?

35:58.423 --> 35:59.289
Come on, diana.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.393
Keep applying pressure.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.328
Diana.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.831
We're losing her.
Beginning cpr.

36:48.173 --> 36:50.407
but you are gonna have
to shoot us down.

36:53.595 --> 36:55.095
We're doing this.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.951
- That doesn't look good.

37:06.358 --> 37:08.124
- Jesus.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.160
- Who did this to her?

37:14.233 --> 37:17.500
- What the hell did you do?

37:17.603 --> 37:19.069
- We're still
getting home, right?

37:19.171 --> 37:21.471
- Fuel tank's damaged.
Plane's not going anywhere.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.772
- What?

37:22.874 --> 37:24.107
- We didn't want this
to happen.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.275
- None of this
would have happened

37:25.377 --> 37:26.910
if you two hadn't tried
to stop levi.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.645
- Everyone on that plane
would have died.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.914
- You don't know that.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.883
- So we're trapped here?
- No.

37:33.986 --> 37:36.319
We still have time.
Gavin can still make it.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.843

37:50.736 --> 37:54.070
Okay.

I can outmaneuver them.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.957
- No, I'm sorry.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.793
I thought it would work
this time.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.361
- What do you mean
"this time"?

38:18.463 --> 38:20.547
- You asked me before
what I was hiding.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.599
I don't have time
to tell you everything,

38:22.684 --> 38:24.234
but I can tell you this:

38:24.336 --> 38:27.637
What's been happening to you
is for a reason.

38:29.207 --> 38:31.691
What reason?
Hey, where are you going?

38:36.081 --> 38:37.647

but yours is here.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.320
For now.

38:47.292 --> 38:49.459
- What about my family?

38:49.544 --> 38:51.494
- There's another way
to save them.

38:51.596 --> 38:53.963
Go back to the beginning,
gavin.

38:55.734 --> 38:59.969
November 16, 1988.

Remember that date.

39:13.318 --> 39:16.986
