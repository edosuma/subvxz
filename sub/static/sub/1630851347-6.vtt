ground-penetrating radar.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.423
There are multiple bodies.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.992
- Levi must have tried
to fix the plane,

11:01.094 --> 11:02.527
tried to fly 'em home.

11:02.612 --> 11:03.828
But they didn't make it.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.196
- Dad.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.515
Dad, what if--what if
mom and josh were on it?

11:07.634 --> 11:08.833
What if we're too late?

11:08.935 --> 11:10.869
- Just yesterday,
I saw them alive, all right?

11:10.971 --> 11:13.004
Maybe they haven't left yet.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.806
I think we can still save 'em.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.641
Rebecca has a plane.

11:16.743 --> 11:17.609
You have to let me try.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.411
- Gavin, stop.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.580
Arrest him.
- What?

11:22.683 --> 11:23.882
- Hey. Get off!
Get off!

11:23.984 --> 11:25.283
- Stop. What are you doing?!
- Stand down.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.652
- Gavin, I'm sorry,
but if something goes wrong

11:27.754 --> 11:30.288
and there's another earthquake,
people will die.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.123
It's over, gavin.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.765
- Good morning.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.870
- Did veronica come back?

11:45.972 --> 11:46.938
- She didn't.

11:53.747 --> 11:57.849
You're, um, worried about her,
aren't you?

11:59.586 --> 12:03.388
- When aaron took me,
I was so scared.

12:03.490 --> 12:07.459
But veronica was nice to me.

12:07.561 --> 12:08.993
At night,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.996
he kept us
in a room together.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.632
She was the only person
I could talk to.

12:14.735 --> 12:15.700
- Lilly.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.607
Are you saying that
aaron kidnapped veronica too?

12:22.709 --> 12:25.543
- Yes.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.847
She's not a bad person.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.715
We need to find her, ty.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.885
[car approaching]

12:37.824 --> 12:39.190
- mom.
- Josh.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.895
Everybody, this is diana.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.730
- Good to meet you all.

12:47.834 --> 12:51.236
- So we have a chance
of getting out of here?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.571
- It's possible.
[cheers]

12:53.673 --> 12:55.039
- I knew I liked you
the moment you arrived.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.975
- Hold on.
I'm not making any promises.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.643
Diana's an engineer.
We're gonna head back

12:58.745 --> 12:59.978
to my plane,
see if we can get it going.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.480
I'm gonna grab some mres.
I'll be right back.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.048
- How long have you
been down here?

13:04.151 --> 13:07.118
- 1,123 days.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.453
Give or take a few.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.524
- Do you know how long we have
till light goes away?

13:12.626 --> 13:14.225
- The one that
I came in through,

13:14.327 --> 13:15.493
once it started to close,

13:15.595 --> 13:17.595
it was gone
in less than 24 hours.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.034
- That puts it
at nightfall.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.702
- All right.
We're ready.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.238
- Okay.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.107
- Plane's a lot closer
than the beach,

13:29.209 --> 13:30.475
so we shouldn't
have connection issues.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.810
- Good.
- I'll call you

13:31.912 --> 13:33.912
as soon
as we have any news.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.313
[engine starts]

13:41.221 --> 13:42.987
- look, I know
we're all anxious,

13:43.089 --> 13:44.455
but we need to be
prepared to leave

13:44.558 --> 13:46.291
as soon as levi says
his plane is ready.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.827
- Don't have to tell me twice.
I'll be ready to go.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.229
- Who says you're going first?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.731
- You trying to take my seat?
Go on.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.333
See where that gets you.
- Hey.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.202
I'm not getting left behind.
- All right, enough.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.103
Nobody said anything
about anyone being left behind.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.939
- Look, we need
to be smart about this.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.040
Fair.
- Sam's right.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.175
There's not enough room
for all of us on the plane,

14:04.277 --> 14:06.177
so we're gonna have
to take multiple trips.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.248
All right.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.783
I say we draw names.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.685
It's the best option
we have right now.

14:15.589 --> 14:18.423
- All right. Everybody
write down their name.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.991
We need to start picking now.

14:25.866 --> 14:26.965
- Hey.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.033
You okay, sweetheart?

14:29.135 --> 14:30.735
- Dad, if that light closes,

14:30.820 --> 14:33.371
mom and josh are
stuck down there forever.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.873
- I'm not gonna
let that happen.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.711
Aldridge, let me
ask you a question.

14:39.813 --> 14:42.413
How did you know
where the clearing was?

14:42.515 --> 14:45.083
- Gavin, that's not important
right now.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.517
- She's full of crap, dad.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.853
- This isn't
how I wanted it to go, izzy.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.022
- How did you want it to go?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.157
What else are you
hiding from us?

14:54.861 --> 14:55.960
[door beeps, unlocks]

14:58.164 --> 14:59.597
finally.
Where have you been?

14:59.699 --> 15:01.299
- Working on a way
to get you out of here.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.368
- How?
- Markman was onto me.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.303
I had to make him think
that I was on his side.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.905
- You were the one
who gave us up.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.340
- It was my only option.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.809
If I didn't,
they'd have rebecca's plane

15:11.912 --> 15:13.344
and we'd have no way
of getting down there.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.779
- So what's your play?

15:14.881 --> 15:16.981
- I told markman about
your compound in oregon.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.416
That's where he thinks
the plane is.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.817
- Well done.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.419
- How long until he figures out
it's not there?

15:21.521 --> 15:22.921
- A couple of hours.
And we need to get you

15:23.023 --> 15:24.355
to the ranch
before that happens.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.557
My car's not far from here,
and I can sneak you out.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.092
- My helicopter's ready to go.
- Hold on.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.961
I need to get word down
to eve and levi,

15:30.063 --> 15:31.562
tell them
his plane's gonna crash.

15:31.665 --> 15:32.997
- Gavin, there really
isn't any time left.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.365
- He could take off
at any moment.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.000
I have to warn them.

15:38.672 --> 15:41.773
There has to be a way
to get a message down there.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.747
- And the next one is...

15:49.849 --> 15:50.915
- Angela o'brien.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.083
- [sighs in relief]

15:52.185 --> 15:55.987
- okay. We got two more slots
for the first flight.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.189
Next one goes to...

15:58.291 --> 15:59.457
- Josh harris.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.526
- Seriously, I better be
in that seat next to you.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.427
- Yeah.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.095
- Come on.
- Come on.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.331
- And the last spot
goes to...

16:08.268 --> 16:10.001
Lucas hayes.
[all groan]

16:10.103 --> 16:12.070
- nice pick, eve.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.838
Much appreciated.
- No way. No way, nah.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.139
To hell with that.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.941
Yeah, I mean,
eve just chose her son.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.476
I say we start over, huh?
- Oh, come on.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.411
That's ridiculous.
- You want to start over?

16:20.513 --> 16:22.947
- No one is repicking anything.
- Shock you'd say that.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.148
Your son's
in the first flight too.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.284
- Look, this is
how we're doing it.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.653
It's not perfect, but
it's the only choice we have.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.222
Everyone just take five.
Go for a walk, grab a drink.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.807
Then we pick the next flight.

16:32.926 --> 16:35.927
[soft chatter]

16:37.397 --> 16:38.863
- eve.
- Ty.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.165
You going somewhere?
- Yeah.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.668
Veronica's gone missing.
I need to go and find out.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.838
- Ty, you can't do this alone.
You know it's too dangerous.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.840
- Look, I--I asked the guys
to look after lilly

16:48.942 --> 16:52.143
while I'm gone,
but if anything happens to me,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.412
I just want you to make sure
she gets back to her family.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.247
Okay?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.749
Goodbye, eve.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.117
Just take good care
of yourself, okay?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.019
- All right, listen,
if you don't find veronica

17:01.121 --> 17:03.488
in the next couple of hours,
you get back here.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.056
Do you hear me?
- Yes.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.558
- Okay. I'm gonna take
the last flight out.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.893
I'll save a seat for you.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.263
- All right.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.365
- Be careful.
- I will.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.737
[metal clangs]
- [gasps]

17:19.839 --> 17:21.439
- hey. Come on.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.207
- Wait, they're about
to pick the next flight.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.409
- They'll save your spot.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.877
I'm not leaving my stash
out there, man.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.378
It's worth too much.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
And don't tell me you don't
remember where you buried it.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.116
You smoke weed.
You don't have amnesia.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.451
Now which way did you go?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.203
- Well, it was that way,
but I don't really think--

17:35.321 --> 17:37.088
- okay, good.
Come on.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.539
We don't have much time.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.124
Let's go.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.873
- System's reading
the new compressor.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.642
- Looks good so far.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.310
- Just need a minute
to calibrate.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.363
- That's another 60 seconds
after all these years, right?

18:07.103 --> 18:07.985
You okay?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.922
- Yeah. I--I think
I just need a minute.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.269
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.604
- What's going on?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.439
- Anxious, I guess.

18:31.277 --> 18:35.713
You--you mentioned
sophia nathan.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.482
So you met her?

18:40.186 --> 18:42.787
How was she?

18:42.889 --> 18:46.958
I mean, did she seem well?

18:47.060 --> 18:48.226
- She did.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.098
You two were together?

18:54.184 --> 18:56.200
- We were engaged.

18:58.054 --> 19:01.539
These last few years, all I've
wanted is to get back to her.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.623
And now that I might--

19:02.742 --> 19:04.208
- you're afraid she moved on.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.781
- The day
before I came down here,

19:10.884 --> 19:12.450
we were making wedding plans.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.687
We were gonna get married
on the beach.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.993
I've thought
about that every day.

19:22.095 --> 19:25.029
- She probably has too.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.731
In my experience,
doesn't matter

19:26.816 --> 19:30.568
how long you've been away
from the person you love.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.271
Those feelings never change.

[plane engine starts]

19:38.077 --> 19:40.578

working just fine.

- What was that?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.898
- I think it's a drone.
It looks military.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.499
- Maybe instead of
crashing drones down here,

20:35.602 --> 20:37.235
they could actually
send some more help.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.903
