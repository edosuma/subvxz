WEBVTT

00:16.300 --> 00:19.767
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.400
COME ON.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.033
THAT'S GOOD.
YOU'RE DOING GOOD, DR. BURKE.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.767
OKAY, I NEED YOU TO TOUCH
EACH FINGER OF YOUR RIGHT HAND

00:27.800 --> 00:29.133
TO YOUR THUMB.

00:29.167 --> 00:31.100
ONE... TWO...

00:31.133 --> 00:33.433
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
KEEP GOING.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.767
THREE. GOOD. ONE MORE.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.733
(Derek) THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S...

00:38.767 --> 00:40.400
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

00:40.433 --> 00:41.633
(Miranda) DR. HAHN--

00:41.667 --> 00:43.400
(Hahn) WAIT FOR IT.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.767
(Miranda) DR. HAHN.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.267
JUST WAIT!

00:48.300 --> 00:50.167
(tone continues)

01:03.667 --> 01:06.667
(monitor beeping steadily)

01:17.267 --> 01:20.067
I CUT THE LVAD WIRE.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.667
ACTUALLY...

01:21.700 --> 01:24.500
I CUT THE LVAD WIRE.
(George) NO, I DID IT.

01:24.533 --> 01:26.700
I'M THE ONE WHO CUT
THE WIRE.

01:28.533 --> 01:31.400
FINE.
I CUT THE LVAD WIRE.

01:31.433 --> 01:34.300
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I'M TOTALLY INNOCENT.
(Meredith) ALEX.

01:34.333 --> 01:35.733
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
WE MADE AN AGREEMENT.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.667
I DIDN'T EVEN--
I WASN'T HERE.
I TOLD YOU GUYS
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.300
PEOPLE!
I KNOW WHO DID THIS,

01:39.333 --> 01:41.667
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
COME CLEAN.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.433
I KNOW.
(George)
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,

01:43.467 --> 01:45.800
IF YOU KNEW,
YOU WOULDN'T BE ASKING US.

01:45.833 --> 01:48.633
I DID WHAT I--
YOU HAVE YOUR SUSPICIONS,

01:48.667 --> 01:50.400
BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW.

01:50.433 --> 01:51.600
NOT FOR SURE.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.567
AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
TO ANY OF US WITHOUT PROOF, SIR.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.800
WELL, ONE OF YOU COMPROMISED
A PATIENT'S LIFE.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.833
ONE OF YOU STOLE AN ORGAN.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.400
ONE OF YOU JEOPARDIZED
THE INTEGRITY OF THIS HOSPITAL

02:00.433 --> 02:02.100
AND OF U.N.O.S.

02:02.133 --> 02:05.200
NOW YOU TELL ME,
AND YOU TELL ME RIGHT NOW!

02:10.733 --> 02:12.667
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

02:16.133 --> 02:18.433
NO SURGERIES.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.167
SIR?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.300
NO ONE SCRUBS IN, NO ONE
WATCHES FROM THE GALLERY,

02:22.333 --> 02:25.067
NO ONE SO MUCH AS GOES NEAR
THE O.R. FLOOR.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.133
UNTIL SOMEONE CONFESSES,
THE FIVE OF YOU

02:27.167 --> 02:29.533
WILL SHARE A SINGLE PATIENT--
CAMILLE TRAVIS.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.067
WHATEVER SHE WANTS,

02:31.100 --> 02:32.367
THE FIVE OF YOU
WILL PROVIDE IT.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.667
NOW GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.200
(Izzie) I WILL GO BACK
AND TELL HIM.

02:37.233 --> 02:39.133
I WILL TELL HIM IT WAS ME.
SHH.

02:39.167 --> 02:41.067
NO. AND GET KICKED
OUT OF THE PROGRAM?

02:41.100 --> 02:42.833
YOU WILL KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

02:42.867 --> 02:45.467
WE ALL WILL KEEP
OUR MOUTHS SHUT.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.400
THIS IS CRAP.
I'M TURNING HER IN.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.067
ALEX.
WHAT?

02:49.067 --> 02:50.800
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID
WE HAD TO STAND BY IZZIE.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.133
I AM SORRY,

02:52.167 --> 02:54.700
AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU DID FOR DENNY.
OH, SHUT UP.

02:54.733 --> 02:57.067
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON
I LIED TO BURKE

02:57.067 --> 02:58.800
IS 'CAUSE I WANTED IN
ON THAT TRANSPLANT SURGERY.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.733
I DON'T CARE ABOUT DENNY,
AND I HOPE YOU GET

03:00.767 --> 03:02.433
THROWN OUT ON YOUR ASS.
(Cristina) HEY,
WE STICK TOGETHER.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.567
YOU KNOW, WE ALL DID THIS.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.600
NOBODY'S A VICTIM.
WE--WE STICK TOGETHER.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.233
DAMN IT.
THANK YOU.

03:08.267 --> 03:09.333
YOU'RE WELCOME.
(George)
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.400
CAMILLE TRAVIS IS
A KID WITH CANCER.

03:11.433 --> 03:14.067
SO WE GET HER WHATEVER
SHE WANTS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.733
HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?
HARDER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

03:16.767 --> 03:20.100
THIS IS CLAIRE AND NATALIE--
CAMILLE TRAVIS' FRIENDS.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.500
HER VERY BEST FRIENDS
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.700
GIRLS, WHO EXACTLY
IS CAMILLE TRAVIS?

03:24.733 --> 03:27.167
LIKE, THE CHIEF
OF SURGERY'S NIECE.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.533
AND, GIRLS, WHAT DOES

03:28.567 --> 03:30.600
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY'S NIECE
WANT, EXACTLY?

03:30.633 --> 03:32.267
LIKE, A PROM.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.833
NO. LIKE,
THE BEST PROM EVER.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.233
WE NEED A THEME.
OH.

03:36.267 --> 03:37.733
(George) A THEME.

03:37.767 --> 03:39.667
OOH! OOH!
CAN WE HAVE SPARKLY LIGHTS?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.600
'CAUSE SPARKLY LIGHTS
ARE AMAZING!

03:41.633 --> 03:44.767
I DIDN'T LIKE TEENAGE GIRLS
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGE GIRL.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.400
I WORE A LOT OF BLACK.

03:47.433 --> 03:48.367
OHH.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.433
MM.

03:49.467 --> 03:52.100
HAD THE WHOLE "ANGRY,
PINK HAIR THING" GOING ON.

03:52.133 --> 03:54.067
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
CAUGHT DEAD AT A PROM.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.800
MY MOTHER MADE ME GO.

03:55.833 --> 03:58.300
MY DATE BARFED ON MY DRESS

03:58.333 --> 04:00.400
AND THEN TRIED
TO FEEL ME UP.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.267
YOU LOOK...

04:03.300 --> 04:05.500
GOD, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

04:05.533 --> 04:07.067
THEY ALWAYS TELL YOU

04:07.067 --> 04:08.800
THAT TRANSPLANT PATIENTS
REBOUND FAST,

04:08.833 --> 04:11.733
BUT, YOU KNOW,
TO SEE IT IN PERSON...
I HAVE WARM HANDS.

04:11.767 --> 04:14.667
I'VE NEVER HAD WARM HANDS
BECAUSE OF MY CIRCULATION.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.633
FEEL.

04:17.667 --> 04:20.300
WARM HANDS.
AND CHECK IT OUT--

04:20.333 --> 04:22.767
I HAVE A REGULAR HEARTBEAT.
(laughs)

04:22.800 --> 04:26.300
YES, YOU DO.

04:27.633 --> 04:29.733
I SHOULD, UM--I GOTTA GO.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.133
I WOULD STAY,

04:31.167 --> 04:33.067
BUT IF BAILEY
CATCHES ME HERE, SHE'D...

04:33.100 --> 04:35.633
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, THE CHIEF
HAS US DOING THIS PROM THING.

04:35.667 --> 04:36.733
IT'S SO...

04:36.767 --> 04:38.667
YOU LOOK...
WHOO-HOO, DENNY.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.567
(laughs) OKAY,
I'M GONNA GO.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.600
WHAT?
HUH?

04:42.633 --> 04:44.167
YOU LIKE YOUR MEN
SICK AND FEEBLE?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.367
YOU DON'T DIG HEALTHY GUYS?

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
(laughs) I...

04:47.433 --> 04:48.733
I DIG YOU.

04:48.767 --> 04:51.233
THEN WHY ARE YOU
ALL SWIRLY AND TWITCHY?

04:51.267 --> 04:54.067
NO, I'M NOT.

04:54.067 --> 04:56.333
IT'S 'CAUSE I ASKED YOU
TO MARRY ME.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.533
SO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

04:58.567 --> 05:01.333
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING
I'D FORGET.
(chuckles) YEAH.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.567
LOOK, DENNY, UM,

05:02.600 --> 05:04.700
I'M GIVING YOU AN OUT.

05:04.733 --> 05:06.400
EXCUSE ME?

05:06.433 --> 05:08.500
I'M GIVING YOU AN OUT. I MEAN,
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE DYING,

05:08.533 --> 05:10.433
AND I WAS SAVING YOUR LIFE.

05:10.467 --> 05:13.367
AND, YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING WAS SO...

05:14.733 --> 05:16.633
WE CAN'T GET MARRIED.

05:16.667 --> 05:19.133
I MEAN,
THAT WOULD BE CRAZY, INSANE.

05:19.167 --> 05:22.067
WE SHOULD DATE AND HAVE SEX,
PLENTY OF SEX.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.367
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOUR HEART GETS BETTER,

05:24.400 --> 05:27.267
AND YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL--
ALL THE SEX YOU CAN HANDLE.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.667
BUT MARRIAGE IS, UM...
(laughs) MARRIAGE, I MEAN--

05:29.700 --> 05:31.533
OKAY. IT'S MY TURN NOW.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.200
BUT I NEED TO--

05:33.233 --> 05:35.100
NO, NO, NO. WE'RE TAKING TURNS.
I'VE DECIDED.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.067
IT'S POLITE,
AND IT KEEPS ME FROM YELLING.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.133
WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN AGAIN,
YOU CAN TALK.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.533
(sighs)

05:40.567 --> 05:43.200
FOR FIVE YEARS,

05:43.233 --> 05:46.700
I'VE HAD TO LIVE BY
THE CHOICES OF MY DOCTORS.

05:46.733 --> 05:51.133
THE GUYS THAT CUT ME OPEN
DECIDED MY LIFE.

05:51.167 --> 05:54.533
THERE WASN'T ONE CHOICE
THAT WAS MINE.

05:54.567 --> 05:56.233
AND NOW...

05:56.267 --> 05:58.233
I HAVE THIS HEART

05:58.267 --> 06:02.067
THAT BEATS AND WORKS.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.167
I GET TO BE LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.367
I GET TO MAKE
MY OWN DECISIONS,

06:08.400 --> 06:10.767
HAVE MY OWN LIFE,

06:10.800 --> 06:15.167
DO WHATEVER THE DAMN HELL
I CHOOSE.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.233
NOW HERE'S THE GOOD PART,

06:17.267 --> 06:21.233
SO YOU LISTEN CLOSE.

06:21.267 --> 06:24.100
WHAT I CHOOSE...

06:24.133 --> 06:26.067
IS YOU.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.467
YOU'RE WHO I WANT
TO WAKE UP WITH

06:29.500 --> 06:31.400
AND GO TO BED WITH

06:31.433 --> 06:35.067
AND DO EVERYTHING
IN BETWEEN WITH.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.367
I GET A CHOICE NOW.

06:40.533 --> 06:43.600
I GET TO CHOOSE.

06:45.333 --> 06:48.367
I CHOOSE YOU, IZZIE STEVENS.

06:51.167 --> 06:52.533
OKAY...

06:53.500 --> 06:55.800
IT'S YOUR TURN AGAIN.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.700
THEY'RE NOT TALKING.

07:18.733 --> 07:20.067
WAGONS HAVE BEEN CIRCLED.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.767
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.533
I-I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT I THINK HAPPENED,

07:23.567 --> 07:24.800
WHAT I ASSUME HAPPENED,

07:24.833 --> 07:26.567
BUT THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
THAT KNOW IT.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.600
I WANT TO MEET
WITH EACH OF THEM SEPARATELY.

07:28.633 --> 07:30.267
I WILL BREAK THEM.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.267
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.200
YOU HAVE YOUR DRESS
FOR THE PROM?

07:34.233 --> 07:35.600
EXCUSE ME?

07:35.633 --> 07:37.333
I'M GOING TO THE PROM.

07:37.367 --> 07:40.067
IF I HAVE TO GO,
EVERYBODY HAS TO GO.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.800
WHA--I'M A GROWN WOMAN.

07:42.833 --> 07:45.567
EVERYBODY GOES TO THE PROM!

07:45.600 --> 07:48.633
EVERYBODY!

07:51.400 --> 07:53.467
CENTRAL HIGH--TWO YEARS AGO,
THEY WENT WITH ALL BLACK.
(Alex humming)

07:53.500 --> 07:55.267
AND THEY HAD, LIKE,
PURPLE LIGHTS--

07:55.300 --> 07:57.633
OH, YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT.
EVERYBODY LOOKED LIKE GHOULS.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.833
FINE. WE COULD GO
WITH ALL WHITE.

07:59.867 --> 08:02.100
(groans)

08:02.133 --> 08:04.233
ARE YOU HAVING A SEIZURE?

08:04.267 --> 08:06.167
WILL THAT GET ME
OUT OF HERE?

08:06.200 --> 08:07.800
FINE.
LET'S GO WITH SEIZURE.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.167
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GET A LIFE!

08:10.200 --> 08:12.367
THE CHIEF'S NIECE.
THE CHIEF'S NIECE.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.133
IT'S OKAY. THE HOT ONES
ARE ALWAYS MEAN.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.667
IT'S LIKE A RULE
OR SOMETHING.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.533
DON'T YOU DARE TRY TO JUDGE US.
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE OUR FRIEND,

08:18.567 --> 08:20.467
WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE DYING
OF CANCER, HAPPY.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.133
THE COLOR DOES MATTER.

08:22.167 --> 08:25.400
MAYBE NOT TO YOU,
BUT IT DOES MATTER.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.600
NOT TO BOTHER YOU, BUT...

08:29.633 --> 08:30.600
WHAT?

08:30.633 --> 08:33.600
ONE OF YOU BETTER SPIT OUT
THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

08:33.633 --> 08:35.567
THE PROBLEM IS THE COLORS
AND--AND THE BALLOONS

08:35.600 --> 08:37.433
AND THE "UNDER THE SEA."
"NO, IT'S 'TITANIC.'"

08:37.467 --> 08:39.100
"HEY, LET'S GO
WITH 'TEARS IN HEAVEN.'"

08:39.133 --> 08:41.067
"NO, THAT'S TOO MORBID.
IT SHOULD BE PINK."

08:41.067 --> 08:43.233
"IT SHOULD BE RED."
IT SHOULD BE A FREAKIN' RAINBOW.

08:43.267 --> 08:45.167
WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THAT
WE'RE VERY, VERY HOPEFUL

08:45.200 --> 08:47.167
THAT YOU SPEAK TEENAGE GIRL.
SILVER AND WHITE--

08:47.200 --> 08:49.167
IT'S MYSTICAL AND MAGICAL
WITHOUT BEING OVER THE TOP.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.500
EVER SEE FASHION WEEK
IN NEW YORK?

08:50.533 --> 08:52.300
LOTS OF SILVER AND WHITE RUNWAYS
AND BACKDROPS.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.300
THAT'S BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT
COLOR THE CLOTHES ARE, THEY POP.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.133
THEY POP?
THEY POP.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.667
O'MALLEY AND KAREV,
GET 500 BALLOONS

08:57.700 --> 08:59.600
IN SILVER AND WHITE
AND A HUNDRED IN BLACK.

08:59.633 --> 09:01.133
SHINY BLACK, NOT THE MATTE.

09:01.167 --> 09:02.400
YANG, STICK WITH CAMILLE.

09:02.433 --> 09:03.800
KEEP HER HAPPY,
KEEP HER SPIRITS UP.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.233
GREY, GET WITH PATRICIA,
MAKE SURE WE CAN ROPE OFF

09:06.267 --> 09:08.267
THE SECOND FLOOR NURSES' STATION
AND THE WAITING AREA.

09:08.300 --> 09:11.067
GOT IT?

09:11.067 --> 09:13.200
OH, NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T GET
TO LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.067
NO, YOU COMPROMISED
MY MEDICAL LICENSE.

09:15.067 --> 09:17.633
YOU NEARLY KILLED A PATIENT,
LIED TO THE CHIEF OF SURGERY

09:17.667 --> 09:19.567
AND MADE ME, YOUR RESIDENT,
LOOK BAD.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.800
NOW WE'RE GONNA DO THIS PROM,
AND WE'RE DOIN' IT RIGHT. MOVE.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.100
CAN YOU...

09:26.133 --> 09:27.400
YEAH.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.433
HEY.

09:28.467 --> 09:29.800
YOU NEVER CALLED.
WHAT?

09:29.833 --> 09:32.533
LAST NIGHT. WE HAD PLANS,
AND YOU WENT OFF WITH IZZIE,

09:32.567 --> 09:34.200
AND YOU NEVER CALLED.
YEAH.

09:34.233 --> 09:35.300
YOU SAID YOU WOULD.
A LOT OF STUFF
WENT DOWN LAST NIGHT.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.833
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

09:36.867 --> 09:38.233
(whispers) I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT IT.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.733
OH, COME ON. I'M NOT
GONNA TELL, GEORGE. IT'S ME.

09:40.767 --> 09:41.933
(normal voice)
LOOK, IT'S VEGAS.

09:41.967 --> 09:44.600
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM
STAYS IN THAT ROOM.
OKAY.

09:44.633 --> 09:45.800
YEAH, I GET IT.

09:45.833 --> 09:46.767
HEY.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.533
(sighs)

09:48.567 --> 09:51.267
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO PROM WITH ME?

09:51.300 --> 09:53.300
NO, GEORGE! NO.

09:53.333 --> 09:56.800
I DON'T WANT TO GO PROM
WITH YOU.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.833
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

10:01.867 --> 10:04.267
SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.633
OH.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.300
OH.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.467
OH! HEY.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.100
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOUR CELL
ALL NIGHT.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.800
UM...
OH, WELL, IT'S, UH...

10:13.833 --> 10:16.467
IT'S A LONG STORY,
WHICH ESSENTIALLY ENDS

10:16.500 --> 10:19.367
WITH ME INVITING YOU
TO A PROM.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.567
AN ACTUAL PROM?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.267
A CORSAGES AND TUXEDOES--

10:22.300 --> 10:24.200
YEAH, I KNOW,
IT'S STUPID, BUT...

10:24.233 --> 10:26.133
NO, I'M IN. I LOVED PROM.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.067
I MEAN, I-I DON'T WANT
TO BRAG OR ANYTHING,

10:28.100 --> 10:30.300
BUT I WAS CROWNED KING.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.300
REALLY? YOU WERE
THAT KID IN HIGH SCHOOL?

10:32.333 --> 10:34.433
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH BEING THAT KID?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.600
NOTHING. IT'S VERY CUTE,
ACTUALLY.

10:36.633 --> 10:37.600
HELLO.

10:37.633 --> 10:40.267
(laughs) HI.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

10:42.500 --> 10:45.167
(sighs) DOC HAD
SOME SEIZURES LAST NIGHT.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.233
PRETTY SERIOUS.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.167
THE--THE CANCER HAS SPREAD
TO HIS BRAIN.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.100
I'M SORRY.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.033
***

10:53.067 --> 10:54.300
HEY.

10:54.333 --> 10:55.267
HEY.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.600
HOW'S PRESTON?

10:56.633 --> 10:59.567
HE'S RECOVERING NICELY.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.800
ADDISON...
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.500
ALL RIGHT.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.433
I MEAN, WE'VE COME SO FAR--
YOU FORGAVE ME FOR MARK...

11:05.467 --> 11:06.567
MM-HMM.
AND WE'RE TRYING.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.233
WE ARE. WE'RE TRYING.
WE ARE TRYING.

11:08.267 --> 11:09.367
WE'RE TRYING.
WE'RE TRYING.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.233
AND--AND I WAS JEALOUS
WHEN THERE WAS NO NEED TO BE.

11:12.267 --> 11:14.800
RIGHT?

11:14.833 --> 11:18.133
ADDISON...

11:18.167 --> 11:19.367
WHAT?

11:19.400 --> 11:22.500
WILL YOU GO TO THE PROM
WITH ME?

11:22.533 --> 11:26.067
***

11:34.267 --> 11:38.267
***

11:45.333 --> 11:48.333
***

11:52.533 --> 11:57.367
***

12:05.333 --> 12:08.200
(clock ticking)
I WENT TO COLLEGE
ON A WRESTLING SCHOLARSHIP.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.833
I PLAYED BASEBALL,
SOME BASKETBALL,

12:09.867 --> 12:11.767
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'LL GO WITH FOOTBALL.
WHAT THE HELL DOES FOOTBALL

12:11.800 --> 12:14.167
HAVE TO DO
WITH WHO CUT THE LVAD WIRES?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.100
LET'S SAY YOU WERE DRAFTED
TO A TEAM

12:16.133 --> 12:17.133
THAT WASN'T YOUR FIRST PICK.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.233
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T LIKE THE PLAYERS,

12:19.267 --> 12:21.167
YOU HATE THE WAY
THEY PLAY THE GAME,

12:21.200 --> 12:23.100
YOU EVEN THINK THE QUARTERBACK
IS FULL OF CRAP.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.067
THE QUARTERBACK'S
A PAIN IN THE ASS

12:25.067 --> 12:26.800
THAT YOU DON'T OWE
A DAMN THING TO.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.767
BUT... IT'S YOUR TEAM.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.300
YOU DON'T QUIT,

12:31.333 --> 12:33.233
YOU DON'T TALK TO THE PRESS,

12:33.267 --> 12:35.167
YOU DON'T...
BITCH TO THE COACH.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.500
YOU JUST...

12:36.533 --> 12:38.433
YOU JUST GO OUT THERE
EVERY SUNDAY,

12:38.467 --> 12:41.333
AND YOU MAKE THE BLOCKS,
AND YOU TAKE THE HITS,

12:41.367 --> 12:43.333
AND YOU--YOU PLAY TO WIN.

12:43.367 --> 12:46.533
YOU SHOW UP, AND YOU SUIT UP,
AND YOU PLAY,

12:46.567 --> 12:48.600
BECAUSE
IT'S YOUR FREAKIN' TEAM.

12:48.633 --> 12:49.833
(clock chimes)

12:49.867 --> 12:52.067
I KNOW YOUR TYPE.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.400
(clock ticking)

12:53.433 --> 12:55.667
YOU'RE A SURGICAL JUNKIE.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.300
YES, SIR.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.667
I'M JUST SAYING,

12:58.700 --> 13:00.600
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
FOR YOU TO BE AWAY

13:00.633 --> 13:02.067
FROM THE O.R. THAT LONG.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.467
NO, SIR.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.400
AND IF YOU WANT
TO GET BACK TO THE O.R.,

13:06.433 --> 13:09.267
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME WHAT
I NEED TO KNOW, AREN'T YOU?

13:09.300 --> 13:11.667
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.633
IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME
TO BE AWAY FROM THE O.R.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.567
IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME
TO SIT IN FRONT OF YOU,

13:16.600 --> 13:18.500
OR ANY OTHER AUTHORITY FIGURE
FOR THAT MATTER,

13:18.533 --> 13:20.433
AND NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU

13:20.467 --> 13:22.367
THE EXACT ANSWER
YOU WANT TO HEAR.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.567
I'M THE ONE WITH THE ANSWERS.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.500
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE
WITH THE ANSWERS.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.700
BUT RIGHT NOW, SIR,
I DON'T HAVE ANY.

13:28.733 --> 13:30.333
DR. YANG--

13:30.367 --> 13:31.833
HOW DO YOU KEEP
YOUR EDGE, SIR?

13:31.867 --> 13:34.300
BECAUSE I WATCH YOU, AND YOU'VE
BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME,

13:34.333 --> 13:35.833
AND--AND YOU'RE CLEAN.

13:35.867 --> 13:37.633
YOU'RE FOCUSED,
YOU ARE THE JOB,

13:37.667 --> 13:38.833
NOTHING GETS TO YOU.

13:38.867 --> 13:40.767
AND THE THING IS, SIR,
IS I WAS LIKE THAT

13:40.800 --> 13:42.567
UNTIL I GOT HERE,

13:42.600 --> 13:44.500
UNTIL I ACTUALLY STARTED
DOING THIS JOB.

13:44.533 --> 13:48.133
AND NOW EVERYTHING IS...

13:48.167 --> 13:50.400
IS FUZZY OR--

13:50.433 --> 13:52.700
THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.
NO, SEE, SIR?
THIS IS THE POINT.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.633
BECAUSE I CAN'T TELL YOU

13:54.667 --> 13:56.567
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.133
I CAN'T TELL YOU,

13:58.167 --> 14:00.200
AND BEFORE, I COULD HAVE--

14:00.233 --> 14:02.800
NO GUILT, NO LOYALTIES,
NO PROBLEM.

14:02.833 --> 14:07.767
BEFORE--BEFORE, I WOULDN'T
HAVE EVEN BEEN IN THAT ROOM.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.567
I WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN INVOLVED,

14:10.600 --> 14:14.233
I WOULD HAVE NEVER FROZEN
IN SURGERY,

14:14.267 --> 14:17.133
AND I WOULD'VE TOLD HIM
WHAT I THOUGHT HE SHOULD DO.

14:17.167 --> 14:20.300
I HAD AN EDGE, SIR.

14:20.333 --> 14:23.733
I HAD AN EDGE,
AND I'VE LOST IT.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.767
AND I NEED IT.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.567
I NEED IT BACK.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.367
SO...

14:29.400 --> 14:33.400
IF YOU COULD JUST TELL ME
HOW YOU KEEP YOURS

14:33.433 --> 14:36.467
AND HOW NOT TO BE AFFECTED...

14:36.500 --> 14:38.767
I KNOW I COULD BE
A GREAT SURGEON.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.667
SO IF YOU COULD JUST
GIVE ME THE ANSWERS,

14:41.700 --> 14:45.200
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

14:45.233 --> 14:47.367
(ticking)

14:50.667 --> 14:53.733
YOU'RE EXCUSED, DR. YANG.

14:53.767 --> 14:54.700
BUT--

14:54.733 --> 14:56.700
YOU'RE EXCUSED.

14:59.433 --> 15:00.767
I'LL TELL YOU.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.533
I'LL TELL YOU WHO CUT
THE LVAD WIRE, SIR...
NO, YOU WON'T.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.467
IF YOU COULD JUST PLEASE--
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW,

15:05.500 --> 15:07.333
NOT FROM YOU.

15:09.067 --> 15:13.233
YEAH, I HAVE THE ANSWERS,
BUT I CAN'T TELL 'EM TO YOU.

15:13.267 --> 15:19.333
I'M NOT GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOU BECOMING LESS HUMAN.

15:19.367 --> 15:21.733
(clock chimes)

15:23.500 --> 15:25.267
I'M A PRETTY GIRL.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.467
WHAT?

15:26.500 --> 15:29.167
I'M NOT BEING ARROGANT,
IT'S JUST...

15:29.200 --> 15:31.400
IT'S JUST KIND OF A FACT.

15:31.433 --> 15:33.600
FOR A LONG TIME, I MADE
A CAREER FROM MY LOOKS,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.533
SO I GET IT--
I'M A PRETTY GIRL.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.467
AND NOT IN A "FROM
"A CERTAIN ANGLE" WAY,

15:37.500 --> 15:38.833
IN AN OBVIOUS WAY.

15:38.867 --> 15:41.400
IT'S THE BLONDE THING
AND THE BIG BOOBS THING.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.333
BIG BOOBS ARE KEY
TO OBVIOUS PRETTY,

15:43.367 --> 15:45.267
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
DR. STEVENS--

15:45.300 --> 15:46.367
THAT'S HOW MEN SEE ME.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.567
I'M NOT A SMART GIRL

15:47.600 --> 15:50.367
OR AN INTERESTING GIRL,
I'M A PRETTY GIRL.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.300
THE BLONDE AND THE BOOBS,
IT CONFUSES GUYS

15:52.333 --> 15:54.233
INTO THINKING
THAT I'M SOMEONE ELSE.

15:54.267 --> 15:55.267
AND I'M USED TO IT.

15:55.300 --> 15:59.267
I'M USED TO THEM WALKING AWAY
WHEN THEY REALIZE...

15:59.300 --> 16:03.433
BUT THEN DENNY GOES
AND ASKS ME TO MARRY HIM.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.367
IS THAT WHY YOU CUT
THE WIRES?

16:05.400 --> 16:08.433
HE DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE I'M A PRETTY GIRL.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.367
(clock ticking)

16:10.400 --> 16:12.500
HE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE...

16:12.533 --> 16:14.567
LIKE ME.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.800
I THINK HE MIGHT KNOW ME.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.800
AND SO IF I DID CUT
THE LVAD WIRE,

16:18.833 --> 16:20.733
AND I'M NOT SAYING
THAT I DID,

16:20.767 --> 16:22.667
BUT IF I DID...

16:22.700 --> 16:26.533
THEN, NO,
I DON'T FEEL GUILTY.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.467
AND I KNOW THAT I SHOULD,

16:28.500 --> 16:31.700
AND I WOULD
IF IT WERE ANYBODY ELSE.

16:31.733 --> 16:34.400
(ticking)

16:34.433 --> 16:37.333
BUT I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING
BUT HAPPY.

16:37.367 --> 16:38.567
(clock chimes)

16:38.600 --> 16:41.333
(ticking)

16:41.367 --> 16:44.333
(chimes)

16:44.367 --> 16:46.533
(chimes)

16:46.567 --> 16:48.600
(chimes)

16:48.633 --> 16:50.833
(chimes)

16:50.867 --> 16:53.467
AREN'T YOU GONNA...

16:53.500 --> 16:55.633
SAY ANYTHING OR...

16:55.667 --> 16:58.700
(ticking)

16:58.733 --> 17:01.733
I'M NOT GONNA BREAK.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.833
I'M STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT,

17:07.867 --> 17:09.800
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BREAK.

17:09.833 --> 17:13.200
(ticking)

17:13.233 --> 17:15.133
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DON'T CARE,

17:15.167 --> 17:17.067
BECAUSE I DO CARE
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME,

17:17.100 --> 17:18.567
I DO...

17:18.600 --> 17:19.533
(sighs)

17:19.567 --> 17:21.433
CARE.

17:21.467 --> 17:25.800
I JUST CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR...

17:25.833 --> 17:27.733
(ticking)

17:27.767 --> 17:31.367
WHICH SEEMS TO BE A THEME
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.300
JUST 'CAUSE
YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING

17:33.333 --> 17:35.233
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU DON'T WANT TO.

17:35.267 --> 17:37.067
YOU CAN WANT TO VERY MUCH.

17:37.067 --> 17:40.567
YOU CAN BE WITH A PERSON
AND BE HAPPY WITH THEM

17:40.600 --> 17:41.667
AND NOT LOVE THEM,

17:41.700 --> 17:44.667
OR YOU CAN LOVE SOMEONE
AND NOT WANT TO BE WITH THEM.

17:44.700 --> 17:47.600
YOU DON'T NEED TO...
LOVE SOMEONE

17:47.633 --> 17:50.067
TO WANT THEM.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.467
OH, IT'S FRUSTRATING.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.100
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR BRAIN
TELLS YOU WHAT YOU WANT

17:54.133 --> 17:56.300
AND WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT
DON'T MATCH UP,

17:56.333 --> 17:58.300
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.133
AND...
WELL, IT'S COMPLICATED.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.833
BUT THAT'S LIFE.

18:03.867 --> 18:05.733
AND LIFE...

18:05.767 --> 18:08.767
(clock ticking)

18:10.300 --> 18:12.400
SUCKS.
(chiming)

18:12.433 --> 18:14.333
I'VE KNOWN YOU
FOR A LONG TIME.

18:14.367 --> 18:16.433
I KNOW YOUR MOTHER
AND FATHER.

18:16.467 --> 18:19.333
AND I KNOW
BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT

18:19.367 --> 18:22.533
THAT YOU DID NOT CUT
THOSE LVAD WIRES.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.767
MEREDITH...

18:24.800 --> 18:27.500
I NEED YOU TELL ME
WHO DID IT.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.433
(ticking)

18:29.467 --> 18:32.333
I'VE BEEN GOING OVER THIS
AND OVER THIS IN MY MIND,

18:32.367 --> 18:33.733
TRYING TO PIECE THIS TOGETHER.

18:35.633 --> 18:37.300
IT WAS YOU.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.367
YOU'RE THE REASON
MY PARENTS BROKE UP.

18:39.400 --> 18:43.133
AND IT WASN'T JUST AN AFFAIR.

18:43.167 --> 18:44.367
SHE REALLY LOVED YOU.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.300
IT WASN'T JUST
THIS CHEAP THING

18:46.333 --> 18:48.500
WHERE SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
SHE WAS MARRIED.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.800
IT WASN'T ALL A LIE.

18:50.833 --> 18:55.767
SHE LEFT HER HUSBAND FOR YOU.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.567
BUT YOU STAYED WITH YOUR WIFE

18:57.600 --> 19:00.467
BECAUSE IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.100
MAYBE SAFE,

19:02.133 --> 19:05.433
BUT SHE WAS THE RIGHT PERSON
FOR YOU TO BE WITH.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.367
AND LET'S FACE IT,

19:07.400 --> 19:09.300
MY MOTHER?

19:09.333 --> 19:11.467
NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SAFE,

19:11.500 --> 19:14.500
BEING WITH THE GOOD GUY
BECAUSE HE'S GOOD.

19:14.533 --> 19:16.833
AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
FOREVER HERE.

19:16.867 --> 19:19.333
YOU'VE NEVER REGRETTED
YOUR DECISION.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.300
YOU'VE NEVER LOOKED BACK.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.200
(clock ticking)

19:23.233 --> 19:26.400
RIGHT?

19:26.433 --> 19:30.567
(chiming)

19:37.367 --> 19:40.433
FINN SAYS WE NEED TO MAKE
A DECISION ABOUT DOC.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.200
GOOD FOR FINN.

19:42.233 --> 19:44.333
CAN WE JUST DO
THIS ONE THING TOGETHER

19:44.367 --> 19:46.067
WITHOUT ARGUING?

19:46.067 --> 19:46.900
FINE.

19:46.933 --> 19:49.267
I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO
PUT HIM TO SLEEP.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.067
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.267
WHAT IF THERE'S A CHANCE
HE CAN GET BETTER?

19:53.300 --> 19:55.067
HE'S NOT GONNA GET BETTER.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.500
YOU KNOW THAT.

19:56.533 --> 20:00.233
WELL, FINN THINKS WE SHOULD
DO IT TODAY, THEN.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.700
(door closes)

20:03.733 --> 20:05.433
DENNY.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

20:05.467 --> 20:07.133
VISITING HOURS
AREN'T FOR ANOTHER HOUR.

20:07.167 --> 20:09.300
YOU ARE NO LONGER HIS DOCTOR.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.233
YOU WANT TO SEE DENNY, YOU COME
BACK WHEN THE VISITORS COME.

20:11.267 --> 20:12.500
I WOULD, BUT I CAN'T WAIT.

20:12.533 --> 20:13.733
IXNAY ON
THE INSUBORDINATION-AY

20:13.767 --> 20:16.133
BUT IT'S MY TURN.
IF THE CHIEF FINDS OUT

20:16.167 --> 20:19.400
YOU WERE EVEN ON THIS FLOOR--
HOLD ON. IT'S HER TURN.

20:24.367 --> 20:26.500
YES.

20:26.533 --> 20:27.700
MY ANSWER IS YES.

20:27.733 --> 20:29.400
OH, NOW, SEE?

20:29.433 --> 20:31.133
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE MY HEART
STOP BEATING,

20:31.167 --> 20:33.100
AND IT'S BRAND-NEW.

20:33.133 --> 20:35.300
I WILL CALL SECURITY
ON YOU.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.233
OKAY.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.200
I WILL COME BACK
DURING VISITING HOURS.

20:39.233 --> 20:41.433
AND IT'S PROM,
SO I'LL SHOW YOU MY DRESS.

20:41.467 --> 20:42.800
OKAY.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.700
I'M GOING.

20:44.733 --> 20:46.433
IZZIE...

20:46.467 --> 20:48.167
YOU DID GOOD.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.433
I TRICKED HER
INTO MARRYING ME.

20:55.467 --> 20:58.000
HOW SMART AM I?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.267
WE'RE THROWING A PROM.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.133
THE CHIEF'S MAKING US
THROW A PROM.

21:05.167 --> 21:06.533
O'MALLEY MENTIONED.

21:06.567 --> 21:09.467
GEORGE CAME TO SEE YOU?

21:09.500 --> 21:12.100
HE'S MY FRIEND.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.267
OH.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.300
I WON'T BEAR A GRUDGE.

21:19.733 --> 21:21.467
WHAT DID YOU...

21:22.867 --> 21:25.167
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.100
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF ME,

21:27.133 --> 21:29.200
BUT I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

21:29.233 --> 21:30.633
AND IF THIS...

21:32.567 --> 21:35.533
IF YOU CAN'T STAY HERE
FOR THIS...

21:37.367 --> 21:39.367
I WON'T BEAR A GRUDGE.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.100
ARE YOU GONNA TELL SHEPHERD
ABOUT...

21:44.133 --> 21:46.767
NOT YET.

21:50.233 --> 21:52.533
I'M, UH...

21:56.233 --> 21:58.267
NOT YET.

22:00.633 --> 22:02.533
OKAY, THERE'S A COUPLE
OF FORMS YOU NEED TO SIGN.

22:02.567 --> 22:04.733
I-I ONLY NEED ONE SIGNATURE.

22:04.767 --> 22:06.533
WELL, YOU--

22:06.567 --> 22:07.633
IT'S FINE.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.700
HERE, I'LL--I'LL SIGN.

22:09.733 --> 22:10.967
SO HOW DO WE DO THIS?

22:11.067 --> 22:13.433
WELL, I'LL GIVE DOC AN INJECTION
OF TERAZOLE TO MAKE HIM SLEEPY,

22:13.467 --> 22:15.367
AND THEN I'LL GIVE HIM AN I.V.
INJECTION OF PHENOBARBITAL.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.833
AND THAT'LL STOP
HIS HEART.

22:16.867 --> 22:18.467
YES.

22:20.233 --> 22:22.667
AND WHAT DO WE DO AFTER,
WITH HIS BODY?

22:22.700 --> 22:25.133
WE CAN...

22:25.167 --> 22:27.267
WE HAVE THE MEANS TO
DISPOSE OF IT FOR YOU.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.833
THAT'S FINE. GO AHEAD.

22:28.867 --> 22:31.133
WE CAN'T THROW HIM AWAY
LIKE HE'S GARBAGE.

22:31.167 --> 22:33.667
(Finn) WE WOULD NEVER--
HE'S OUR DOG, DEREK.

22:33.700 --> 22:37.667
THERE'S THAT, UH,
CLEARING BY THE TRAILER.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.233
OVERLOOKING THE WATER.

22:40.267 --> 22:42.200
WE CAN, UH,
BURY HIM THERE.

22:42.233 --> 22:44.800
THAT SOUNDS NICE.

22:44.833 --> 22:45.767
MM.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.300
YOU READY?

22:47.333 --> 22:49.067
YEAH.

22:53.133 --> 22:56.600
I'M SO SORRY, DOC.

22:56.633 --> 22:57.833
I'M SORRY, TOO.

22:57.867 --> 22:59.267

22:59.300 --> 23:01.400
THAT'S THE HOSPITAL.
I GOTTA GO.

23:01.433 --> 23:02.600
OKAY.

23:02.633 --> 23:05.100
OKAY.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.233
OKAY.

23:06.267 --> 23:07.767
I'LL BEGIN.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.300
SHH.

23:09.333 --> 23:11.200
IT'S OKAY.

23:15.133 --> 23:16.667
(Meredith) IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.700
IT'S OKAY.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.633
IT'S OKAY.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.200
(Finn) HE'S GONE.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.067
(Finn) MEREDITH--

23:57.067 --> 23:58.800
NO, I HAVE TO GO HOME
AND CHANGE.

23:58.833 --> 24:01.067
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?
MEREDITH...

24:03.667 --> 24:07.067
I'M SORRY... FOR YOUR LOSS.

24:07.067 --> 24:09.100
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,

24:09.133 --> 24:11.667
HE WASN'T REALLY MY DOG
FOR THAT LONG.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.733
HE WAS MORE DEREK'S DOG.

24:13.767 --> 24:15.600
MEREDITH...

24:16.867 --> 24:19.500
HE WAS A GOOD DOG.

24:19.533 --> 24:21.800
HE WAS.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.733
(Miranda) OH,
I'M TOO TIRED FOR THIS.

24:33.767 --> 24:35.400
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND,
DR. BAILEY?

24:35.433 --> 24:37.333
UH, AT HOME WITH THE BABY.

WHY?

24:41.767 --> 24:44.067
WELL, WITH BURKE UPSTAIRS...

24:44.067 --> 24:45.167
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM,

24:45.200 --> 24:47.200
I'M SURE THE CHIEF
WOULD'VE LET YOU OUT.

24:47.233 --> 24:48.500

25:16.267 --> 25:18.600
THIS WHOLE THING
IS BRINGING BACK

25:18.633 --> 25:20.533
VERY TRAUMATIC MEMORIES
OF BEING A BAND GEEK

25:20.567 --> 25:23.433
WITH BRACES AND A LISP
AND SPENDING THE WHOLE EVENING

25:23.467 --> 25:26.633
WITH SKIPPY GOLD
TALKING ABOUT "STAR WARS."

25:26.667 --> 25:29.600
(sighs)
SO, YOU WANT TO, UM, DANCE?

25:29.633 --> 25:32.133
LOVE TO.

OF YOU?

25:43.600 --> 25:45.800
I'M A FRIGHTENING MAN,
CAMMIE.

25:45.833 --> 25:47.600
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

25:47.633 --> 25:51.633
WHERE BRIAN'S CONCERNED,
YES, I AM.

25:51.667 --> 25:54.700
BE KIND TO HIM.

25:54.733 --> 25:57.133
HE LOVES ME.

25:57.167 --> 26:00.467
I'VE BEEN LOVED.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.800
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE

I SAID IT.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.400
I SAID IT OUT LOUD
TO YOUR FACE,

26:43.433 --> 26:45.133

WHEN I SAY I LOVE YOU,

27:41.367 --> 27:42.567
MAYBE.

SHE DOESN'T MAKE ME SICK
TO MY STOMACH

30:33.467 --> 30:36.333
THINKING ABOUT MY VETERINARIAN
TOUCHING HER WITH HIS HANDS!

30:36.367 --> 30:40.433
OH, MAN, I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
NOT TO BE LOOKING AT YOU.

30:54.633 --> 30:57.633
***

30:59.800 --> 31:01.600
WHOA. YOU LOOK NICE.

31:01.633 --> 31:03.533
THANK YOU. SO DO YOU.
HOT DATE?

31:03.567 --> 31:05.233
NAH. THIS THING IS CHEESY.

31:05.267 --> 31:07.167
I WOULDN'T WASTE
A DECENT CHICK ON THIS.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.433
(laughs)
YOU HEADIN' IN?

31:08.467 --> 31:10.367
YEAH, I'M JUST
GONNA SEE DENNY FIRST.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.500
OH, OKAY.

31:12.533 --> 31:16.233
***

31:34.833 --> 31:38.067
***

31:52.467 --> 31:57.067
***

32:12.767 --> 32:15.767
***

32:20.867 --> 32:24.067
***

32:35.500 --> 32:38.500
***

32:51.200 --> 32:54.200
***

33:07.567 --> 33:09.167
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

33:09.200 --> 33:11.333
UH, I HAD PANTIES ON.
BLACK. DO YOU SEE THEM?

33:11.367 --> 33:13.533
MEREDITH,
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

33:13.567 --> 33:15.833
HELP ME LOOK FOR THEM.
AND FIX YOUR TIE.
MEREDITH...

33:15.867 --> 33:17.267
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

33:19.167 --> 33:22.533
OH, THE NURSE TOLD ME
TO COME FIND YOU.

33:22.567 --> 33:24.300
YOU HAVE TO COME NOW.
IT'S IZZIE.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.700
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.067
OKAY, GO.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.367
(Miranda) CHIEF.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.633
I DID MY INTERNSHIP HERE,

33:45.667 --> 33:47.800
MY RESIDENCY,

33:47.833 --> 33:50.700
CAME BACK HERE THE MINUTE
MY FELLOWSHIP WAS DONE.

33:50.733 --> 33:53.733
THE DAY THEY TOLD ME
I WOULD BE CHIEF,

33:53.767 --> 33:56.433
I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE
IN THAT O.R.

33:56.467 --> 33:59.633
SPENT MY WHOLE CAREER
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

34:02.267 --> 34:05.200
MY WHOLE LIFE.

34:05.233 --> 34:07.467
SIR...

34:11.700 --> 34:16.067
DENNY DUQUETTE DIED
AT 7:42 THIS EVENING.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.200
DAMN IT.

34:22.233 --> 34:24.567
WHAT HAPPENED?
(Olivia) I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.333
I-I DIDN'T THINK YOU GUYS WOULD
WANT ME TO GO TO THE CHIEF--
WHERE IS SHE?

34:27.367 --> 34:30.133
SHE'S IN THERE WITH HIM.

34:38.067 --> 34:40.433
(Cristina) IZZIE.

34:43.433 --> 34:46.500
I THINK IT WAS A STROKE.

34:46.533 --> 34:50.067
HE WAS PRONE TO BLOOD CLOTS.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.300
A CLOT COULD HAVE FORMED
ON HIS SUTURES,

34:52.333 --> 34:53.800
TRAVELED TO HIS BRAIN.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.800
IT ONLY TAKES A SECOND.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.200
IZ...

34:57.233 --> 35:00.233
DR. HAHN DID A BEAUTIFUL JOB
ON THE SURGERY.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.767
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK OF BLOOD CLOTS.

35:07.533 --> 35:09.467
HE DIED ALL ALONE.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.300
HE WAS ALONE.

35:11.333 --> 35:14.200
THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU COULD'VE DONE.

35:15.800 --> 35:19.100
I CHANGED MY DRESS
THREE TIMES.

35:19.133 --> 35:22.633
I WANTED TO LOOK NICE.

35:22.667 --> 35:26.167
I WOULD'VE
BEEN HERE SOONER...

35:26.200 --> 35:29.500
BUT I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHICH DRESS TO WEAR.

35:29.533 --> 35:32.500
IZZIE...

35:34.333 --> 35:36.333
WE SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE.

35:36.367 --> 35:39.200
(Meredith) IZ, THERE ARE
THINGS THAT THEY NEED--

35:39.233 --> 35:41.400
THEY NEED TO MOVE HIM.

35:41.433 --> 35:44.233
TAKE HIM TO THE MORGUE.

35:46.767 --> 35:49.667
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.
I KNOW YOU WANT TO--

35:49.700 --> 35:53.533
CAN YOU PLEASE,

35:55.333 --> 35:57.667
I WANT TO BE ALONE
WITH DENNY.

35:57.700 --> 36:00.433
(Alex) IZZIE,
THAT'S NOT DENNY.

36:00.467 --> 36:02.200
SHUT UP.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.733
(whispers) IZ...

36:05.767 --> 36:08.667
THAT'S NOT DENNY.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.067
(normal voice) THE MINUTE
HIS HEART STOPPED BEATING,

36:11.067 --> 36:13.600
HE STOPPED BEING DENNY.

36:13.633 --> 36:15.800
NOW I KNOW YOU LOVE HIM,

36:15.833 --> 36:18.433
BUT HE ALSO LOVED YOU.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.367
AND A GUY THAT LOVES YOU
LIKE THAT,

36:20.400 --> 36:23.233
HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

36:23.267 --> 36:25.267
BECAUSE IT'S NOT DENNY,

36:25.300 --> 36:28.767
NOT ANYMORE.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.800
***

36:38.567 --> 36:41.600
AN HOUR AGO,
HE WAS PROPOSING.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.167
AND NOW...

36:47.200 --> 36:50.833
AND NOW HE'S GOING
TO THE MORGUE.

36:50.867 --> 36:53.333
ISN'T THAT RIDICULOUS?

36:55.833 --> 36:59.567
ISN'T THAT THE MOST
RIDICULOUS PIECE OF CRAP

36:59.600 --> 37:03.067
YOU'VE EVER HEARD?

37:03.067 --> 37:04.800
***

37:04.833 --> 37:08.500
(sobbing)

37:08.533 --> 37:11.633
(whispers) COME ON.

37:11.667 --> 37:14.667
(Izzie sobbing)

37:25.233 --> 37:29.500
(sobbing continues)

37:29.533 --> 37:32.667
***

37:43.133 --> 37:46.133
***

37:56.733 --> 38:00.367
***

38:09.800 --> 38:13.100
***

38:18.667 --> 38:20.300
(Addison laughs)

38:20.333 --> 38:22.700
I'M SORRY.
THESE ARE RIDIC--HEY.

38:22.733 --> 38:25.100
HI.
DEREK,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

38:25.133 --> 38:26.200
UH, I WAS WITH A PATIENT.
SHEPHERD.

38:26.233 --> 38:28.267
YES?
HAVE YOU SEEN
BAILEY'S INTERNS--

38:28.300 --> 38:30.067
GREY, YANG?

38:30.100 --> 38:31.400
I'M LOOKING FOR IZZIE STEVENS
IN PARTICULAR.

38:31.433 --> 38:33.767
NO, I HAVEN'T. NO.
CHIEF.

38:33.800 --> 38:36.800
***

38:46.733 --> 38:49.733
***

38:55.733 --> 38:57.667
IT WAS ME.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.767
***

38:59.800 --> 39:02.767
I CUT HIS LVAD WIRE.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.667
I DID IT. NO ONE HELPED ME.

39:08.833 --> 39:10.567
***

39:10.600 --> 39:14.167
AND NOW...

39:14.200 --> 39:17.233
I THOUGHT
I WAS A SURGEON, BUT...

39:19.067 --> 39:20.667
I CAN'T.

39:20.700 --> 39:24.067
I THOUGHT I WAS A SURGEON,
BUT I AM NOT.

39:24.100 --> 39:27.633
***

39:27.667 --> 39:29.067
SO I QUIT.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.800
IZZIE.

39:31.833 --> 39:35.500
***

39:43.800 --> 39:45.267
WELL, I GUESS THAT...

39:45.300 --> 39:47.200
PUTS AN END
TO THE EVENING.

39:47.233 --> 39:49.067
YEAH.

39:49.067 --> 39:53.333
YEAH, I GUESS IT DOES.

39:53.367 --> 39:55.633
***

39:57.600 --> 40:01.333
COME ON.
I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

40:01.367 --> 40:04.567
***

40:14.667 --> 40:16.667
MEREDITH.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.767
***

40:21.600 --> 40:22.533
MEREDITH?

40:22.567 --> 40:25.467
***

40:31.100 --> 40:34.100
***
