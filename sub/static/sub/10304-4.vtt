01:18.560 --> 01:22.917
Order, order, order.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.594
This meeting of NO MA'AM...

01:24.800 --> 01:27.633
...National Organization of Men
Against Amazonian Masterhood...

01:27.840 --> 01:29.398
...will now come to order.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.475
Brother Jefferson will read
the minutes.

01:32.680 --> 01:36.116
Al, he's just gonna do
his stupid 8:01, 8:02 joke again.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.198
No, l won't, and it's not stupid.

01:39.440 --> 01:46.232
The minutes of the last meeting
are 8:01, 8:02, 8:03, 8:04!

01:47.160 --> 01:49.310
Forget about the minutes.
Go sit down.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.631
Now, last meeting,
we argued about...

01:52.840 --> 01:56.469
...which Big 'Uns centrefold was sexier,
July or August.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.636
We couldn't decide,
so we ripped them out...

01:58.840 --> 02:01.115
...put them down our pants,
and danced around.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.271
Then we each drank about 30 beers.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.279
Now, wait a second.
That's how we started the meeting.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.430
That's the only reason
we had the meeting.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.432
That's right.
Then let's get underway.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.035
Treasurer Bob Rooney,
pass out the liquid gold.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.238
Hey, this isn't our regular beer.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.357
Yeast N Stuff?

02:27.640 --> 02:30.791
Sorry, guys,
but they raised the beer tax again.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.359
So this is it.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.229
Unless we wanna go back and have sex
with our wives for more beer money.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.879
No way.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.910
Beer is beer. We didn't become
NO MA'AMers by being discriminating.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.156
-Or employed.
-Or happy.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.278
-Or bathed.
-Or documented.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.833
Down the hatch.

03:06.480 --> 03:12.157
Hey, if l wanted to reek of cheap booze,
l'd just go kiss my wife.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.348
So l gather things
didn't go so well at the lawyer's.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.630
lt was a disaster.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.190
He said my marriage
to Franny is legal.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.795
lt can't be legal. You were married
in a hot tube by a nudist...

03:28.000 --> 03:30.958
...who called himself
Reverend Flashback.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.753
Not only
is Reverend Flashback legal...

03:35.000 --> 03:38.959
...he is now one of the
Forbes 500 richest televangelists...

03:39.200 --> 03:42.272
...right between the pope
and Dionne Warwick.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.354
How can a nudist reverend
be so rich?

03:45.600 --> 03:48.478
Yeah,
and where does he keep his wallet?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.753
Same place you keep your head.

03:55.040 --> 03:59.158
Guys, come on. lt's simple.
Reverend Flashback has mega bucks...

03:59.400 --> 04:02.278
...because churches
have tax-exempt status.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.149
Can you imagine all the good we could
do if we didn't have to pay taxes?

04:06.440 --> 04:09.352
-Hey, hey, we could buy real beer.
-And maybe some ale.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.318
-Ale sucks.
-Suck this.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.916
Gentlemen, focus, focus.

04:18.160 --> 04:22.756
-Now, where were we?
-ln your garage.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.878
-l meant where were we-?
-All right. Look.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.311
l'm gonna call a lawyer friend of mine
and find out more about this.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.916
lf Reverend Flashback can call himself
a church and not pay taxes...

04:33.120 --> 04:34.269
...then why can't we?

04:34.520 --> 04:37.193
Our wives would take the money
and waste it on charities...

04:37.400 --> 04:39.675
...health insurance, lingerie.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.951
Then we'll keep it a secret.
Jefferson, not a word to:

04:45.200 --> 04:46.918
You got it, buddy.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.388
Then it's settled.

04:48.640 --> 04:53.668
We will become a church, a sacred
organization of peace and brotherhood.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.234
l'll drink to that.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.510
Hey, he's got good beer.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.751
Hold him down.
Hold him down for me.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.070
Hey, Lucky sounds hungry.
You better feed him, Bud.

05:12.320 --> 05:17.155
l don't feed him. l walk him.
You're supposed to feed him.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.831
No, l'm not.
l bathe him and vacuum him dry.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.232
Okay, then who feeds him?

05:26.480 --> 05:27.595
Nobody.

05:27.800 --> 05:31.588
If it weren't for the girl's
edible underwear, I wouldn't eat at all.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.750
Hi, kids.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.112
Hey, look what you got me
for my birthday.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.516
All you have to do is wrap it.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.309
Wrap it?
Oh, do you need a card too?

05:49.560 --> 05:51.471
-l hate your birthday.
-l know.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.917
What happened to the days when you'd
give us money to buy you a cake...

05:55.120 --> 05:57.156
...and then we'd eat it
before you got home?

06:01.240 --> 06:03.310
Peg, did Jefferson call?

06:03.560 --> 06:06.472
No, Al, and guess what Friday is.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.756
Oh, Peg, you know l hate
when you do this.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.356
l hate when you do anything,
but especially this.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.076
lt's my birthday.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.959
-You know what that means.
-Okay, Peg. Get a blanket.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.072
l'll get a Big 'Uns
and l'll meet you behind the furnace.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.473
Not sex, Al.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.477
Okay, but l offered,
and that counts for one.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.800
l wanna go on a date.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.116
Fine. Go.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.519
With you.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.275
lt's my birthday and l want dinner,
dancing and a show.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.870
Okay. l'll go,
but only because l'll be getting some.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.514
-Oh, Al.
-Some dinner.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.753
God, how sad.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.315
You know what l'd do
if my lover lost interest in me?

06:51.920 --> 06:54.070
You'd sleep with his patrol officer?

07:00.200 --> 07:02.668
We're in, buddy.
The lawyer says we can be a church.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.633
Jefferson, you know how women
hate to see us happy. Look sad.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.389
Al, we'll never have to pay taxes
on anything.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.713
Oh, Jefferson, that is just awful.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.028
We can get tanked for pennies.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.672
A toast to our leader,
a true man of the froth.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.759
Gentlemen,
in the history of mankind...

07:37.000 --> 07:39.230
...there have only been
a few truly good scams.

07:39.480 --> 07:43.632
Loch Ness monster, Canada.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.475
And now the tax-free
Church of NO MA'AM.

07:53.920 --> 07:58.198
You know, beer tastes better
when it's tax-free.

07:58.760 --> 08:03.151
Yeah, and Big 'Uns look bigger
when they're tax-free.

08:04.640 --> 08:08.030
That's why we started
this bogus church in the first place.

08:08.280 --> 08:13.035
Men, there's nothing
but good times ahead.

08:15.240 --> 08:21.395
Not so fast,
Reverend Half Moon Pits.

08:22.240 --> 08:27.633
This is no man of the cloth.
This is Al "Scratch-and-Sniff" Bundy.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.188
And now,
l've exposed his stench for all to see.

08:32.440 --> 08:35.671
You go, girl. Take it.

08:36.520 --> 08:43.392
This is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.513
As you have just witnessed...

08:45.720 --> 08:48.996
...chauvinism and religious quackery
are alive and well...

08:49.200 --> 08:52.192
...right here in Al Bundy's garage.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.715
-calling themselves
the Church of NO MA 'AM...

08:54.920 --> 08:59.630
... in a shameless and clearly
illegal attempt to av oid paying taxes.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.590
l have defrocked you, Al Bundy.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.952
l have destroyed
the Church of NO MA'AM.

09:07.200 --> 09:11.318
l won, l won, l won.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.597
l won, l won, l won.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.910
Are you that NO MA'AM guy
on the news?

09:17.160 --> 09:20.152
He's also Arnold the pig
on Green Acres.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.232
All of these letters are from guys
that support your cause.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.990
-How would you know that?
-We open them.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.157
And the guys at work are prepared
to put down their mail pouches...

09:33.400 --> 09:38.394
...and assault weapons
and follow you anywhere, Reverend Al.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.190
Reverend Al?

09:46.440 --> 09:49.238
That's who all these letters
are addressed to.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.913
We've gone national.

09:51.160 --> 09:55.039
You know what this means,
Reverend Al?

09:56.840 --> 10:00.469
Ka-ching.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.558
This is incredible.

10:06.800 --> 10:10.110
-Another $10.
-Hey, that's my dough.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.991
Man, everybody's trying to get a ticket
on the NO MA'AM express.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.674
Hey, why not?
Hey, listen to this one.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.435
"Gentlemen,
although l cannot reveal my identity...

10:23.680 --> 10:26.353
...l am also under the iron rule
of a woman.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.955
Here's $10 for your cause.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.317
Your friend, B. Clinton.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.868
Don't tell H., not her real name."

10:40.680 --> 10:44.275
Hey, our phony church
is becoming a real religion.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.031
And like other great religions,
we have a sacred obligation...

10:48.240 --> 10:51.994
...to make a lot of money
and open our own theme park.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.357
NO MA'AM's Land.

10:57.080 --> 11:00.470
Guys, am l the only one who thinks
we're getting a little carried away?

11:00.720 --> 11:02.199
Yes.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.668
Don't you see?

11:03.880 --> 11:07.316
Real religions have commandments,
beliefs, values...

11:07.520 --> 11:10.353
...traditions that have been formed
over thousands of years.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.875
No problem.
We'll make some of them up.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.513
And now,
onto the burning question...

11:16.720 --> 11:19.439
...that has plagued
the great religions for centuries.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.591
ls there an afterlife?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.512
Hell, no.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.354
How do we keep these suckers
hemorrhaging cash?

11:29.080 --> 11:30.399
We'll do it like the pros.

11:30.640 --> 11:35.156
Rent a hall, buy some dirt-cheap
time on cable TV or Fox...

11:35.720 --> 11:40.874
...give a fire-and-brimstone speech,
and suck their bank accounts dry.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.271
-Oh, Al.
-What is it, Tammy Faye?

11:49.440 --> 11:51.476
Have you forgotten what day this is?

11:52.040 --> 11:55.589
Come-as-your-favourite
Hee Haw-character day at Kmart?

11:57.680 --> 11:59.432
lt's my birthday.

11:59.720 --> 12:04.748
So your birthday and Hee Haw-
character day are the same?

12:05.440 --> 12:07.476
What are the odds?

12:10.640 --> 12:14.269
-Come on. Get dressed.
-Oh, Peg, no, not tonight.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.909
Tonight, our monster truck,
the Ford Taurusaurus...

12:17.120 --> 12:20.032
...is jumping 1000 Geo Metros.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.109
lf they don't make it, there could be
hundreds of dollars worth of damage.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.920
Look, Al, if you don't want to see
something else...

12:27.160 --> 12:30.789
...tiny and underpowered
get squashed...

12:31.040 --> 12:33.349
...you will get dressed
and come with me.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.632
All right, gentlemen. l guess this
meeting of NO MA'AM is adjourned.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.151
We will convene tomorrow
and talk about...

12:42.400 --> 12:46.518
..."eecing-flay the ongragation-cay."

12:48.800 --> 12:54.238
Oh, Al. l'm just so excited.
This is just like before we got married.

12:54.880 --> 13:00.557
Oh, Al, is that money in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?

13:02.280 --> 13:04.157
lt's money, Peg.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.828
Just like before we got married.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.588
Let's get this over with.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.671
" Eecing-flay the ongragation-cay?"

13:29.240 --> 13:33.597
Should l order my new Cadillac
with cloth or leather seat covers?

13:33.840 --> 13:37.196
l'm getting leopard,
so they match my underwear.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.994
Guess l won't have any seat covers.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.070
You know,
it's not too late to call this off.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.316
What is with you, Griff?

13:51.560 --> 13:53.630
We're gonna make a fortune tonight.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.952
The last time l felt this queasy
in church is when someone said:

13:57.200 --> 13:59.555
"You may kiss the bride."

14:00.280 --> 14:01.759
Griff, will you relax, all right?

14:01.960 --> 14:06.556
l'm sure Al is gonna handle this
with respect and dignity.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.630
Brothers.

14:13.480 --> 14:19.635
For years, we have been tortured by
the shrill voices of our nagging wives...

14:19.880 --> 14:22.917
...but at last, we have found a man.

14:23.160 --> 14:27.711
A man who speaks to us all.
A man who married for our sins.

14:27.960 --> 14:34.479
Let's everybody give it up
for the Reverend Al Bundy.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.069
Can l hear it for my alter vixens
Halla and Luyah?

15:02.880 --> 15:06.350
Believers, guests...

15:07.880 --> 15:12.476
...those of you with the deep pockets
that got the cushioned seats up front...

15:13.360 --> 15:16.318
...let me tell you a little story.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.877
God created man.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.109
Everything was going great, then
Eve came around and said, "Apple?"

15:26.560 --> 15:29.028
The one time they offer us
something to eat...

15:29.240 --> 15:31.196
...we wind up selling women's shoes.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.675
Now, l know that a lot of you
are wondering...

15:38.160 --> 15:40.116
...what the Church of NO MA'AM
is all about.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.999
Hooters!

15:48.480 --> 15:52.678
Yes, but we are also about making
the world something it used to be...

15:57.120 --> 16:00.635
...back when men were men
and women were ribs.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.429
Tell it, Reverend Al.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.909
When a driver's-side air bag
was called a mother-in-law.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.353
When a frank conversation with
the wife used to begin with:

16:14.560 --> 16:17.916
"What's for dinner?" and ended with
"You call that dinner?"

16:20.920 --> 16:22.876
Would you like a squeeze?

16:23.120 --> 16:24.917
Oh, yes.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.792
-Wipe your brow?
-Bless you, my child.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.838
Though l see
you've already been blessed.

16:34.880 --> 16:38.316
But it is our mission to bring back
the natural order of things.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.154
-Guy things.
-Amen.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.394
Like barber shops, hardware stores...

16:47.640 --> 16:50.757
...those calendars, you lift
the cellophane, she's naked in there.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.394
l want to bring us back
to those times.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.072
This is an engine
that runs on money.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.994
l'm not talking about that unleaded,
eco-friendly...

17:07.240 --> 17:10.675
...tree-hugging,
girlie-jiggling money.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.309
You go, preacher man.

17:16.359 --> 17:21.638
l'm talking about beer-guzzling,
truck-driving, low-riding...

17:21.839 --> 17:24.512
...belching, biting, folding money.

17:33.680 --> 17:39.073
Now, if no one wants to testify,
we will pass the collection plate.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.910
l wanna testify.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.912
A woman!

17:44.200 --> 17:47.510
Now, now, now,
let us not jump to conclusions.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.072
Want me to take her down,
Reverend Al?

17:51.280 --> 17:55.751
That will not be necessary,
Brother Archimedes.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.678
The days are over
when a woman could...

17:57.880 --> 17:59.757
...whoop us like
a nation of Gerry Cooneys.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.192
Actually, l have very little to say.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.352
Amen.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.672
l'd like to thank the Reverend Al...

18:10.880 --> 18:14.839
...for giving such a stirring,
pork-laden speech.

18:15.880 --> 18:21.671
Hurry up, Marcie.
l'm about to be born again, and again.

18:25.520 --> 18:29.559
You're gonna be laughing out the other
side of your pipe organ in a minute.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.356
My women's group
has commandeered the video booth.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.550
There's something we'd like to show
you to put a smile on your snouts.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.950
Girlie porn?

18:42.240 --> 18:44.151
Even better.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.914
Let's go on a date with Reverend Al.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.558
Roll it, girls.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.548
Here he is, dancing with his wife.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.956
Take her down, Archimedes.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.869
Take him down, Dot.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.272
Damn.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.751
You a lot of woman.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.558
l'm a lot of everything.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.030
And here's your man's man at a
restaurant call Potpourri, eating quiche.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.677
Now, l can explain that.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.595
l had ordered a meatball sandwich,
extra ball.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.551
Let's see where they went next.
Bowling, perhaps? Why, no.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.876
They're attending
a performance of Cats...

19:52.680 --> 19:57.515
...with all proceeds
going to the Chicago Ballet.

19:58.920 --> 20:03.516
And finally, behold your beloved
Reverend Al and the missis...

20:03.760 --> 20:07.992
...outside
the Rock'Em Sock'Em Motel.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.118
So there you have it...

20:11.360 --> 20:16.514
...your leader on a date with his wife,
deeply in love.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.469
Say it ain't so, Reverend Al.

20:20.720 --> 20:27.592
Tell us you were with a hooker,
or at least a guy dressed like one.

20:28.440 --> 20:31.989
Oink your way out of this one,
Reverend Fatback.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.633
l have sinned.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.988
l have consorted with my wife.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.357
But it's not like l enjoyed it.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.751
l mean, you know,
it was her birthday, for heaven's sake.

21:01.320 --> 21:06.394
Hold it. Let he who is without wife
cast the first stone.

21:06.760 --> 21:07.988
Thanks, Griff.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.112
Here's your presents, Mom.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.920
Open mine first, Mom.
l can't wait to see what l got you.

21:20.120 --> 21:24.989
Oh, kids, this is the best birthday
l've ever had.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.710
Well, bicentennials
are always special.

21:30.480 --> 21:33.040
Al, don't be such a grouch.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.350
l mean, sure you lost
your congregation...

21:35.600 --> 21:38.114
...your pride,
and every last shred of dignity...

21:38.360 --> 21:42.069
...but at least the lRS
isn't after you for tax fraud.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.194
l wonder who that could be.

21:47.920 --> 21:51.913
Reverend Al Bundy, this is the IRS.

21:52.160 --> 21:55.675
Put up your hands
and throw out your wallet.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.992
l'll be back in 20 years.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.115
-Bye, Dad.
-See you.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.799
Don't wait up.
