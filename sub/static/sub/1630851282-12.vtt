19:10.000 --> 19:11.551
I mean,
our dogs are getting married.

19:11.620 --> 19:14.310
- Yeah.
[both laugh]

19:16.206 --> 19:17.379
- Please be seated.

19:19.310 --> 19:23.241
Sit. Sit.

19:23.310 --> 19:26.241
Welcome, everyone,
to this joyous day,

19:26.310 --> 19:28.413
where we will join
Lulu and Poochie-Boy

19:28.482 --> 19:31.586
in holy muttrimony.

19:31.655 --> 19:33.965
Now, bef--
- Stop the dog wedding!

19:34.034 --> 19:35.758
[all gasping]

19:35.827 --> 19:37.310
- What are you doing?

19:37.379 --> 19:39.379
- I can't let this wedding
happen, Lex.

19:39.448 --> 19:42.413
Look at this!

19:44.275 --> 19:47.551
I said, look at this!

19:49.034 --> 19:51.206
Fisher, you're making me
look like an idiot.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.482
- You could've held the door.

19:57.689 --> 20:01.517
- This machine will translate
dog barks into words.

20:01.586 --> 20:03.827
You need to hear
how Lulu really feels.

20:04.344 --> 20:06.413
- I am so sorry about this.

20:06.482 --> 20:08.344
- Don't be sorry.
- Yeah. We've always wondered

20:08.413 --> 20:09.586
what our dogs have to say.

20:09.655 --> 20:11.103
- Yes, sometimes we do voices

20:11.172 --> 20:12.344
and pretend they're talking
to each other.

20:12.413 --> 20:14.068
- [high-pitched]
Yes, we do Poochie-Boy.

20:14.137 --> 20:15.448
- [imitating dog]
I love you, Lulu.

20:18.413 --> 20:19.689
- All set.

20:23.103 --> 20:26.241
Lulu, do you love
Poochie-Boy?

20:26.310 --> 20:28.965
[barks]

20:29.034 --> 20:30.896
- First of all,
my name is Marge.

20:33.241 --> 20:34.862
Second, I do love Poochie-Boy.

20:34.931 --> 20:36.586
- Aha!

20:36.655 --> 20:38.827
[barks]
- But only as a friend.

20:40.482 --> 20:42.275
I don't want to get married
to him.

20:42.344 --> 20:44.103
- What? Really?

20:44.172 --> 20:45.724
- That doesn't make any sense.

20:45.793 --> 20:47.241
I-I've seen the photos
of you two

20:47.310 --> 20:49.344
online and you always
seem so happy.

20:49.413 --> 20:51.965
[barks]
- Social media is a mirage.

20:52.034 --> 20:55.862
The truth is I kinda
have a crush on Reggie.

20:55.931 --> 20:57.517
- Reggie, you dog.

21:00.068 --> 21:01.310
- I can't believe this.

21:03.068 --> 21:05.000
- Presley, you were right.

21:05.068 --> 21:07.965
I should have listened to you.
I am so sorry.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.068
- It's okay. We'll be even
right after this.

21:11.137 --> 21:15.344
- After what?

21:15.413 --> 21:17.344
I deserve that.

21:17.413 --> 21:18.620
Come here, you.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.620
- Sorry, everyone.

21:21.689 --> 21:23.379
Looks like there won't be
a wedding today.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.137
- Aww.
- Wait.

21:25.206 --> 21:27.620
We still could
throw a wedding.

21:27.689 --> 21:31.103
There are two people here
who do belong together.

21:31.172 --> 21:33.000
- Yes! Let's do this!

21:34.137 --> 21:35.758
- No!

21:35.827 --> 21:37.758
After spending some time
with you guys,

21:37.827 --> 21:40.172
it's obvious that
you two are in love.

21:40.241 --> 21:42.000
both: We are?

21:42.068 --> 21:43.620
[barks]

21:43.689 --> 21:44.862
- Of course you are.

21:44.931 --> 21:47.172
You should
totally get married.

21:47.241 --> 21:50.482
- I would, but Christine could
get any dog owner she wanted.

21:50.551 --> 21:53.758
- Ah, there's only one dog
owner I want.

21:53.827 --> 21:55.000
It's you.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.413
[barks]
- Kiss her, you fool.

22:00.655 --> 22:02.172
- Should we--yep?
- Yep. Let's do it.

22:02.241 --> 22:03.172
- Okay.
- Ah.

22:03.241 --> 22:05.482
[cheers and applause]

22:05.551 --> 22:07.103
