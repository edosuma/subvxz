WEBVTT

00:02.654 --> 00:05.179
Previously onCharmed...

00:05.222 --> 00:07.355
HARRY:
That black ooze
is the Harbinger of Hell,

00:07.398 --> 00:09.357
and its arrival heralds
the third phase

00:09.400 --> 00:10.836
of the Prophecy.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.403
With the blossoming of death
comes the rise

00:12.447 --> 00:14.144
of the Source of All Evil,
and then...

00:14.188 --> 00:15.493
We fall.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.321
That whole apocalypse thing.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.844
Magic ruined my life.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.108
I don't want to control magic,

00:21.151 --> 00:22.544
I want to destroy it.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.720
HARRY:
If you want to destroy magic,
why are we here?

00:24.763 --> 00:26.330
We're trying to find
the Origin Dagger.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.810
The dagger that controls
the Flame?

00:27.853 --> 00:29.333
Using the Flame

00:29.377 --> 00:30.465
to control magic
is not gonna change

00:30.508 --> 00:32.075
what the Elders did to you.

00:32.119 --> 00:35.078
If you're looking
for the Origin Dagger...

00:35.122 --> 00:36.645
you're too late.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.344
FIONA:
Well, if you have the Dagger,
then you must know

00:40.388 --> 00:42.172
that the prophecies
speak of a Steward

00:42.216 --> 00:44.131
who will activate the Source
on your behalf.

00:44.174 --> 00:47.221
I was told the Steward
would make his way to me

00:47.264 --> 00:48.396
in the final days.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.354
I'm your damn Steward.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.660
Evil is upon us.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.618
Another Elder has been
murdered.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.794
Someone else is trying
to complete the Prophecy

00:55.838 --> 00:57.492
by killing every last Elder.

00:57.535 --> 00:58.667
Miss me?

01:00.843 --> 01:02.105
HARRY:
No!

01:03.237 --> 01:06.675
The last Great Sage has fallen.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.285
There's one thing
Alistair didn't know

01:08.329 --> 01:10.592
when he dispatched Hunter
to kill those sages.

01:10.635 --> 01:11.680
There's one more left.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.377
I'm still a sage.

01:13.421 --> 01:16.163
The Prophecy can't happen
until somebody kills... me.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.171
MACY:
As the ancient text states,

01:24.214 --> 01:26.129
the Source will be brought about by the Harbinger of Hell,

01:26.173 --> 01:28.784
who will tip the scales
of evil with a deluge of blood

01:28.827 --> 01:30.525
and the deafening screams
of human torment.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.584
PARKER :
Maggie.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.587
Maggie!

01:51.198 --> 01:52.764
Help me.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.245
Parker?

01:55.289 --> 01:57.334
Are you there?

01:57.378 --> 01:59.510
Parker, I'm here.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.344
Guys!
Parker called out to me!

02:07.388 --> 02:09.651
Just like Galvin did when
his soul was trying to reach me.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.218
What do you think it means?

02:11.261 --> 02:13.220
Well, there's
no way to know.

02:13.263 --> 02:15.439
But it's promising
he's still...

02:15.483 --> 02:16.919
human.He was.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.616
He was himself.
He was Parker.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.271
We have that address
from Niko.

02:21.315 --> 02:22.968
The one she got
when she was tracing

02:23.012 --> 02:24.622
those video calls
from Lucy's cell.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.321
What if Parker's there
with his dad?

02:27.364 --> 02:28.757
We should go.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.325
Now.
Maggie, we've
talked about this.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.587
We need a game
plan first.

02:32.630 --> 02:33.631
We risk cocking it all up

02:33.675 --> 02:35.677
if we burst in unprepared.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.463
I'm sorry.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.335
I'm sorry, I just
can't believe

02:41.378 --> 02:42.640
it's come to this.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.512
The great sages--

02:44.555 --> 02:46.340
all gone.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.392
The blossoming of death.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.220
There's a clear path
for the Source to rise.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.395
If Alistair or Fiona

02:58.439 --> 02:59.744
get the Harbinger
out of Tartarus

02:59.788 --> 03:01.355
and work out how to open

03:01.398 --> 03:03.487
its sacred vessel...You mean "paint can."

03:03.531 --> 03:04.749
Yes.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.316
It's Galvin.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.926
That's weird.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.539
Hello?

03:13.367 --> 03:14.890
What?

03:17.893 --> 03:20.330
Wait, these are all
Kappas and Phi Deltas.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.549
GALVIN:
Macy.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.377
Come here.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.943
In here.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.989
You got to see this.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.515
Oh, my God.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.691
Yeah, it's really bad.
They called me in

03:33.735 --> 03:35.476
for my epidemiology background.

03:35.519 --> 03:36.694
They think it's a virus?Honestly,

03:36.738 --> 03:38.522
they can't even come
close to a diagnosis.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.698
The symptoms don't track
with any of the usual suspects.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.700
Ebola, Marburg, Lassa.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.702
There have been four patients
so far-- all bleeding

03:44.746 --> 03:46.269
from the eyes, nose,
mouth and ears.What about

03:46.313 --> 03:47.705
the patients in
the waiting room?

03:47.749 --> 03:50.012
All the ones I saw were
at the Cinco de Mayo party.

03:50.055 --> 03:53.320
I'm hoping to find a scientific
explanation for this, but...

03:53.363 --> 03:54.886
honestly, I'm-I'm afraid
it might be, um...

03:54.930 --> 03:57.541
Demonic. It has to be.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.979
I'm, uh, gonna need
to get a blood sample.

04:01.023 --> 04:01.937
Already done.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.073
Thanks.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.032
WOMAN:
Dr. Burdette, we need you.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.081
GALVIN:
What do we got?

04:16.125 --> 04:18.388
What if we're too late?Too late for what?

04:18.432 --> 04:19.911
You think
the Harbinger's released.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.565
MAGGIE:
You think the
Cinco de Mayo party

04:21.609 --> 04:23.045
was infected by the Harbinger?

04:23.088 --> 04:24.612
It's possible.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.789
Alistair must have found a way
to get to the paint can

04:27.832 --> 04:30.748
and open it.The Harbinger virus
is lethal.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.663
It cannot become airborne.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.318
I need to get to the lab
and test this.

04:35.362 --> 04:38.495
MALE NURSE:
Bay 2.All right, watch your back.

04:38.539 --> 04:39.583
MALE NURSE:
Coming through, please.MEL: Oh, my God.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.325
Niko.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.939
MAN :
Charge nurse, call admitting.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.767
Charge nurse, call admitting.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.820
Let's go.

05:05.043 --> 05:07.655
She looks different
from other patients.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.961
She's not bleeding
from her eyes or ears.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.834
This doesn't appear
to be the Harbinger virus.

05:17.447 --> 05:20.058
Well, whatever she has, it's
resistant to my healing powers.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.974
According to this, a CT
scan revealed swelling

05:23.018 --> 05:25.063
in both the hippocampus
and amygdala.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.369
Well, those are both
areas of the brain

05:26.413 --> 05:28.110
associated with memory.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.549
Wait. I have an idea.

05:39.556 --> 05:43.125
MEL: I love you, but... NIKO: Because you
made choices for me.

05:43.168 --> 05:46.520
It sounds like her memories are
flooding her brain or something.

05:46.563 --> 05:47.825
Oh, no.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.393
Could I have done this
to her somehow?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.830
By telling her the truth
about her past?

05:52.874 --> 05:55.572
A complication of the
history rewriting spell.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.748
Her brain is trying to
make sense of it all.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.365
She's at risk of an aneurysm.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.890
We have to help her somehow.
There has to be

06:08.933 --> 06:10.065
some kind of spell.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.417
What the hell are
you doing here?

06:14.461 --> 06:15.462
Greta. Hey.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.028
Um, we were here

06:17.072 --> 06:18.726
visiting someone else,
and we saw Niko,

06:18.769 --> 06:20.380
and we just wanted
to see how she was.

06:20.423 --> 06:23.731
Yeah, well, only close friends
and family are permitted, so...

06:23.774 --> 06:25.776
excuse me.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.493
MAGGIE: Oh, my God,
everyone's getting so sick.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.537
What do we do?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.234
We find Parker.
If we can't stop

06:49.278 --> 06:51.106
the Harbinger from
summoning the Source,

06:51.149 --> 06:53.456
then preventing Parker from
becoming the Source's vessel

06:53.500 --> 06:54.936
is our last,
best option.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.503
He doesn't know
he didn't kill his mother.

06:56.546 --> 06:57.808
I can convince him
he's still good.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.462
Just because he's
a demon born of human

06:59.506 --> 07:01.159
doesn't mean he has
to take on the Source.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.510
Do you really think
you can get through to him?Yes.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.207
That address from Niko.
Let's go find Alistair now.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.078
You said we needed
a plan first.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.603
That was before we knew the
Harbinger was out. Let's go.

07:18.263 --> 07:21.136
GALVIN:
Macy. I'm here to help.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.530
Y-Yeah, you don't
have to do that.

07:23.573 --> 07:24.748
GALVIN:
Who else are you gonna get

07:24.792 --> 07:27.795
to be your lab assistant
for a demon virus?

07:27.838 --> 07:29.927
Well, I thought you were leaving
town to get away from all that.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.581
I was leaving town
to help save lives,

07:31.625 --> 07:33.148
but if I can
save them here, I...

07:33.191 --> 07:34.671
I can't
turn my back on that.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.151
Besides, leaving
won't do me much good

07:36.194 --> 07:37.718
if we don't get this
contained.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.808
Fair enough.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.941
Okay...

07:49.556 --> 07:51.209
They match.

07:52.994 --> 07:55.779
It... it's the same virus
that killed the rat.

07:55.823 --> 07:58.565
It-it... it's...
it's the Harbinger.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.958
: I...

08:01.002 --> 08:02.786
I can't believe
this is happening.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.929
Oh, my God.

08:14.972 --> 08:17.845
This can't be the place--
there's nothing here.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.238
I fear Alistair's moved on.

08:21.762 --> 08:24.025
He must know
we're on his tail.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.599
This really feels
like a dead end.

08:35.863 --> 08:38.822
Wait, what's that?

08:42.609 --> 08:45.350
Those look like burn marks.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.091
PARKER
Maggie...

08:47.135 --> 08:49.050
I need you.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.791
Parker.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.185
Um... God, what is the name

08:54.229 --> 08:56.057
of that spell?
The one where

08:56.100 --> 08:59.800
an empath sees a past event
by touching an object?

08:59.843 --> 09:01.932
Psychometry.Yes, that's it.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
How do you know that?

09:03.630 --> 09:05.109
Tessa's aggro study plan.You know,

09:05.153 --> 09:08.591
I suggested studying spells
many times when...

09:08.635 --> 09:10.985
Never mind. Your powers
may well be evolved enough

09:11.028 --> 09:12.595
to make this work.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.816
I can do this.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.253
Parker wants me
to reach him.

09:22.213 --> 09:25.608
Ostende historiam tuam mihi.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.611
What happened in this room?

09:31.048 --> 09:33.616
ALISTAIR:
You are so close.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.923
Soon the dagger
will take your humanity

09:35.966 --> 09:39.013
and the power of the Source
will be yours.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.367
Parker's in pain.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.935
And his dad said he's close
to taking on the Source.So it's all the more

09:47.978 --> 09:51.025
urgent we find him
before he's too far gone.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.682
GALVIN:
We got to call the hospital

09:55.725 --> 09:57.161
and quarantine the patients.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.860
This is not a
normal virus.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.949
It's demonic. It
wants something,

10:01.992 --> 10:03.428
and it will change
tactics to get it.

10:03.472 --> 10:06.649
A virus that thinks?

10:06.693 --> 10:10.131
Holy...Yeah. I know.

10:11.915 --> 10:15.745
I don't even know if I want to
know the answer to this, but...

10:15.789 --> 10:18.269
what does it want?

10:18.313 --> 10:20.881
To tip the scales to evil.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.448
To-to tip the scales to evil--
w-what does that mean?

10:23.492 --> 10:25.450
DOCTOR:
His symptoms

10:25.494 --> 10:27.278
are progressing quickly.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.814
MACY:
It means we fall.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.476
The Harbinger's back.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.783
It's infecting all of Hilltowne,
and I think...

10:53.827 --> 10:55.916
it's our fault.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.395
MAGGIE:
Our fault? What do you...

10:57.439 --> 10:59.963
what do you mean?The Harbinger
was inside Hunter.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.183
That's why he was so powerful.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.185
When we vanquished him,

11:04.228 --> 11:07.014
the Harbinger spread
as an airborne contagion.

11:08.102 --> 11:11.192
We fell
right into Alistair's hands.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.976
He set up his own son to die.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.979
It's Galvin.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.808
The first patient they diagnosed
just attacked a doctor.

11:18.852 --> 11:22.377
The Harbinger is infecting
everyone with evil.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.727
To summon the Source
with a deluge of blood.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.295
MACY, MEL and MAGGIE:
And the deafening screams
of human torment.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.514
Oh, my God.
Niko's in that hospital.Well, they've quarantined

11:29.558 --> 11:32.474
the patients, so...And she's wearing the
witch hunters' rosewood ring.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.737
She'll be protected
from any magical disease

11:34.781 --> 11:36.043
either way.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.175
I should've never broken
Elder Bari's needle.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.177
If I'd used
my evil sight on Hunter,

11:40.221 --> 11:42.223
we could've known all this.
We could've stopped it.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.746
Macy, we can't
be sure of that.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.792
Maybe there's a way
for me to use

11:45.835 --> 11:47.358
my evil sight
without the needle.

11:47.402 --> 11:50.100
I could use the Vortex.
I-I could use the voodoo again.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.928
I-I have the remains
of the Harbinger rat.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.191
I could use them
to reach the Harbinger

11:54.235 --> 11:56.106
and-and control its thoughts
the way I did with Fiona.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.805
Macy, that's way
too dangerous.No. No way.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.763
I agree. Your mind may
be split into fragments,

12:00.807 --> 12:02.286
rendering you insane,
or you could fall

12:02.330 --> 12:04.767
to the dark side or be killed.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.247
MAGGIE:
It's just too many "ors"

12:06.290 --> 12:07.901
where we lose our sister.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.295
Right.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.167
You're right.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.822
There will be
another way.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.476
Well, I'm gonna
go back to the hospital

12:18.520 --> 12:20.043
and see if Galvin's made
any progress.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.479
MEL:
I will come with you.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.221
I found a memory restoring spell
that might help Niko.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.093
And we'll keep up the
search for Parker.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.790
I have an idea.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.792
Keep us posted.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.892
Ma'am. Ma'am, you can't be in...

12:49.464 --> 12:52.206
Niko.

12:52.249 --> 12:55.252
No, no, no.
How did...

12:58.081 --> 13:00.214
She took off the ring.

13:00.257 --> 13:02.477
Damn it, Greta.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.522
Okay.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.966
With your ever-expanding powers
and your new weapon,

13:13.009 --> 13:16.056
you may be able
to connect with Parker

13:16.099 --> 13:17.927
on an empathic plane.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.451
That may be what
he's summoning you to.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.153
It's worth a try.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.268
PARKER:
Maggie.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.531
Oh, thank God.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.272
You found me.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.013
I knew you would.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.710
You're okay. You're you.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.407
Parker, listen,

14:03.451 --> 14:04.626
I have to tell you something
about your mom's death.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.888
Maggie, you have
to find Charity

14:05.932 --> 14:07.281
before my dad can kill her.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.717
She's the last Great Sage.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.545
We stripped her of her
powers. She can't be.

14:10.588 --> 14:11.894
My dad thought so, too.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.548
But when he couldn't
complete the prophecy,

14:13.591 --> 14:16.203
he realized...We didn't strip her
of her Elder status.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.205
I have to go.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.337
My dad thinks I'm on his side.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.383
Find Charity.
Keep her alive,

14:22.426 --> 14:23.950
and the prophecy
can't be completed.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.473
You can stop all of this.

14:25.516 --> 14:26.996
Parker, wait.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.043
I love you, Maggie.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.750
We have to find Charity.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.143
She's the last Great Sage.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.145
Impossible.
She's lost her powers.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.711
But not her status
as an Elder.

14:46.755 --> 14:47.930
She's on the run.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.453
Harry, do you know
where she may have gone?

14:51.455 --> 14:53.457
I might.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.417
The Gardens of Latebra.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.592
What's that?

14:57.635 --> 15:00.073
A safe haven
for all who need shelter.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.597
Very few people
know of its existence.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.383
Years ago,
Charity and I used to dream

15:06.427 --> 15:09.430
about escaping to a place
where no one could ever find us.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.563
Just the two of us...

15:12.607 --> 15:15.044
forever.Harry.

15:17.307 --> 15:20.136
If she's there,
who knows what she's capable of.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.617
I'm ready.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.445
Let's go.

15:25.446 --> 15:26.664
What if we gene edit
a retrovirus?

15:26.708 --> 15:29.015
It won't work fast enough.Hey.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.233
Niko's infected.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.669
Greta took off her ring.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.019
No. Mel.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.585
Her eyes were
totally bloodshot,

15:34.629 --> 15:36.109
and they were restraining her.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.980
It's infecting their brains.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.721
Science isn't the answer.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.462
I remember something from
the Yoruba texts when I studied

15:41.505 --> 15:42.637
to be a Chiriji.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.295
What is that?

15:48.338 --> 15:50.514
The deafening screams
of human torment.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.218
The infection.

15:58.261 --> 16:00.263
It's spread
beyond the hospital.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.699
Get off me! Get off me!

16:01.743 --> 16:03.571
Hold him steady!

16:03.614 --> 16:05.573
WOMAN:
Stay down! Stay down!

16:13.624 --> 16:15.104
We're running out of time.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.335
What if I can save the people
that are already infected?

16:28.378 --> 16:30.337
Would that help
tip the scales back?

16:30.380 --> 16:31.468
I'm not sure.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.166
Maybe.
What have you got?

16:33.209 --> 16:35.124
The spell I was gonna use
to remove the Ibifrom you--

16:35.168 --> 16:36.343
what if we could use that

16:36.386 --> 16:37.735
to remove the evil
that's infecting everyone?

16:37.779 --> 16:39.520
I-It might,

16:39.563 --> 16:41.217
but your grandmother
lost a finger,

16:41.261 --> 16:42.523
and she was only helping

16:42.566 --> 16:44.351
one person.I can't let them just die.

16:44.394 --> 16:45.439
Guys, we don't have time

16:45.482 --> 16:47.180
to debate this.
If there's a shot,

16:47.223 --> 16:49.138
we have to take it.Let's head to the roof.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.401
The infected
can't reach us up there.I'm gonna head home,

16:51.445 --> 16:53.142
see if I can find anything
in The Book of Shadows

16:53.186 --> 16:54.187
in case it doesn't work.

16:54.230 --> 16:55.144
Be careful.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.059
Mace, let's go.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.409
There has to be another way.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.498
I know what I'm doing, okay?
I trained for this for months.

17:01.542 --> 17:04.545
Remember? Just give me a chance
to show off my shamanic skills.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.249
Just trust me.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.252
Okay?

17:17.906 --> 17:20.082
Okay.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.748
There she is.Charity.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.706
Wait.

17:35.750 --> 17:36.751
Listen to me.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.710
Inciti!

17:41.582 --> 17:43.540
What the hell are you doing?

17:43.584 --> 17:45.412
Are you trying to help Alistair?

17:45.455 --> 17:47.370
He's trying to kill me
and fulfill the prophecy.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.720
We know.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.418
We're here to protect you.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.289
Even though you make me sick.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.337
Fine.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.817
Well, if you really
want to help,

17:59.861 --> 18:02.516
this plant contains
the key ingredient

18:02.559 --> 18:04.213
for the Akkadian Smokescreen,

18:04.257 --> 18:05.954
the only spell that can keep me
permanently hidden.

18:05.997 --> 18:08.348
But it takes years to bloom.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.828
I need a witch willing to speed
up the plant's growth cycle.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.615
BOTH:
Orb and get Mel.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.617
While we're having

18:16.660 --> 18:18.532
this moment,
can I just say you can burn

18:18.575 --> 18:19.794
in Hell forever,

18:19.837 --> 18:21.796
you absolute evil...

18:21.839 --> 18:23.276
MEL:
You want my help

18:23.319 --> 18:24.625
so you can perform

18:24.668 --> 18:26.409
the Akkadian Smokescreen
on yourself?

18:26.453 --> 18:27.976
The same spell
I could have used

18:28.019 --> 18:29.456
on Niko instead of erasing
her memory?

18:30.544 --> 18:31.806
How about I take you out
right now.Mel!

18:31.849 --> 18:33.503
HARRY:
No, no, no!

18:33.547 --> 18:34.939
The prophecy.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.292
Give it to me.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.432
Thank you, Mel.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.173
I know
none of this is easy.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.491
PARKER :
Oh, Charity!

19:04.534 --> 19:07.189
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.451
Parker?

19:08.495 --> 19:10.497
Oh, Maggie, I'm so scared.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.499
Just find Charity for me?

19:12.542 --> 19:13.804
Pretty please?

19:13.848 --> 19:15.328
You set me up.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.895
You called out to me so
I'd lead you to Charity.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.462
It's the end of the world, babe.

19:19.506 --> 19:20.985
Get Charity out of here.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.248
We'll take care
of Parker.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.814
Be careful.

19:25.555 --> 19:28.384
You're gonna regret that.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.821
Aah!

19:37.088 --> 19:38.568
Mel!

20:03.071 --> 20:04.333
Don't make me do this.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.726
I know you're
in there somewhere.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.597
Parker, this isn't who you are!

20:09.382 --> 20:11.514
You didn't kill your mother!
That was your brother

20:11.558 --> 20:12.559
and your father tricking you!

20:14.604 --> 20:15.692
You're in there somewhere.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.781
I know it.
I can feel it.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.698
Parker, I love you.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.047
Please come back to me.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.745
Do it, Maggie.

20:24.788 --> 20:25.876
Please. Vanquish me.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.272
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

20:30.316 --> 20:32.056
Aah!

20:46.549 --> 20:48.290
MAGGIE :
Parker, I love you!PARKER: Do it, Maggie.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.987
Please. Vanquish me.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.991
Never send a boy
to do a woman's job.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.166
ALISTAIR:
The Source

20:55.210 --> 20:57.212
can't rise
until that witch is dead.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.474
Don't worry.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.476
I know how to find Charity.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.391
And you won't hesitate...

21:02.435 --> 21:05.307
to kill your own sister?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.222
Oh.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.355
I thought you got me.

21:09.398 --> 21:12.053
Save your doubts
for your son.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.011
His weakness is a problem.No, his weakness

21:14.055 --> 21:16.100
is gonna prove an asset.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.364
Once the Source has risen,
Parker's taking it on.

21:18.407 --> 21:21.149
It's just you and I.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.978
I control the demons,
you control the witches.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.634
We're on the same page...

21:27.677 --> 21:30.332
aren't we?

21:30.376 --> 21:32.508
Yes, of course.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.597
Good.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.042
MEL:
You had him.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.914
Why didn't you
vanquish him?

21:46.957 --> 21:48.524
He was in there, Mel!

21:48.568 --> 21:50.352
The real Parker.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.224
I could feel him,
like I felt Angela Wu.

21:53.268 --> 21:56.402
Are you sure that's
not what you want to feel?

21:59.100 --> 22:01.972
He begged me to vanquish him.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.496
Parker's still
human enough

22:03.539 --> 22:05.324
to understand he'd rather die

22:05.367 --> 22:08.370
than do the bad things
he's being forced to do.

22:08.414 --> 22:11.112
I hope you're right.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.207
You really think
this is gonna work?

22:19.250 --> 22:20.991
And you're still gonna be okay?

22:21.035 --> 22:22.166
I know it will.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.691
I can feel
my grandma guiding me.

22:32.438 --> 22:35.266
I'm ready now.Uh, well,

22:35.310 --> 22:37.530
just before,
I-I wanted to say...

22:37.573 --> 22:40.315
um, that I'm sorry

22:40.359 --> 22:43.057
for getting you involved
in all of this.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.973
If there's one thing I regret...

22:46.016 --> 22:47.975
Hey.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.978
There's no regrets.

22:51.021 --> 22:52.980
I mean, Idon't have any.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.634
Even after that...

22:54.677 --> 22:58.028
Abiku possessed me, I...

22:58.072 --> 23:00.640
It just made me realize
how grateful I am to be human.

23:00.683 --> 23:03.033
And since then,

23:03.077 --> 23:04.644
I've been thinking...

23:04.687 --> 23:06.602
how...

23:06.646 --> 23:09.518
how much of a burden
that must be for you.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.738
And your sisters.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.437
I want to help you carry it.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.616
What does that mean?
Y... You're not leaving?

23:22.749 --> 23:25.404
That's tomorrow's problem.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.233
Great.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.160
CHARITY:
We can't be here.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.032
She can find me.
This-this room--

23:45.075 --> 23:47.208
it's here for her.
Fiona has a connection to it.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.470
We don't have a choice.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.776
I need the power of the Vortex

23:49.819 --> 23:50.994
to complete
the Akkadian Smokescreen.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.736
Please, just hurry, hurry.
She can find me.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.220
When my sister's right,
she's right.

23:59.263 --> 24:01.135
No. No.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.397
Fiona!

24:03.311 --> 24:04.443
No!

24:06.401 --> 24:08.098
See you soon, Har.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.328
Hold still.
I'll try to heal you.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.556
Aw, come on.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.085
Oh, Harry...

24:39.434 --> 24:42.350
You know, I always loved you.

24:46.180 --> 24:49.357
No, no. No, no, no.
No, no...

25:11.422 --> 25:13.729
What's going on
with the sky?

25:21.650 --> 25:23.347
Fiona found us.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.136
Charity's dead.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.792
Does that mean...

25:48.938 --> 25:51.506
The deluge of blood.

26:03.736 --> 26:07.130
Macy and Galvin
are our only hope.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.132
If they can stop
the infection,

26:09.176 --> 26:10.786
stop the patients
from attacking,

26:10.830 --> 26:12.788
the scales
may tip back.

26:14.790 --> 26:17.271
Either way,
we should go to them.

26:17.314 --> 26:20.579
If this really is the end,
we must face it together.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.582
Let's bring The Book of Shadows
just in case.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.847
Parker.

26:30.197 --> 26:32.634
If you're out there...

26:32.678 --> 26:36.420
if you can still hear me...

26:36.464 --> 26:38.597
I love you.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.644
And I know you still love me.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.429
That's what
I'm counting on.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.171
Hey, Mags.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.173
Steal you for a moment?

26:50.217 --> 26:51.435
Mel!Let her go!

26:51.479 --> 26:53.263
ALISTAIR:
Oh, we'd love
to stay and chat,

26:53.307 --> 26:55.178
but we got
some hell to raise.

27:03.491 --> 27:06.799
Map invokè Oranyan, Blan é Nwa.

27:06.842 --> 27:10.280
E Obalu Aye,

27:10.324 --> 27:12.631
guerisè é moun ki pran Pox la.

27:22.815 --> 27:25.165
There's one more step

27:25.208 --> 27:26.732
to complete the ritual.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.344
Sacrifice.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.349
Sacrifice?! No...

27:37.743 --> 27:39.222
Galvin, stop! Please!

27:39.266 --> 27:40.441
You can't!

27:40.484 --> 27:42.704
You were right
all along.

27:42.748 --> 27:43.966
Sometimes...

27:44.010 --> 27:46.665
you got to lose one
to save the many.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.712
No. No, no, no, no.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.715
Harry!

27:54.847 --> 27:56.718
Macy, there you are.
Maggie's been...

27:56.762 --> 27:58.807
We have to stop him.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.506
I can't! Oranyan!

28:02.550 --> 28:04.770
Obalu Aye!

28:04.813 --> 28:07.903
Pranm nan plas moun sa yo.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.731
Se on sakrifis ki pou fèt

28:09.775 --> 28:11.559
lot yo sovè.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.822
K li

28:13.866 --> 28:15.432
fet!

28:15.476 --> 28:17.217
Galvin!

28:17.260 --> 28:18.697
: No!

28:20.786 --> 28:22.483
No!

29:15.362 --> 29:17.451
No.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.583
Galv...Macy!

29:19.627 --> 29:21.455
I'm so sorry.

29:21.498 --> 29:22.848
He's gone.

29:25.415 --> 29:28.331
And your sisters
need you.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.638
Alistair has Maggie.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.734
Thank you.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.519
I just called the hospital
to check on Niko.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.434
All the victims of the
Harbinger have been healed.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.827
She's still in a coma.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.655
We may have saved
her from the virus,

29:47.698 --> 29:49.700
but her memories
are still messed up.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.702
Where's Galvin?

29:54.836 --> 29:56.882
Oh, my God.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.448
No, no.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.461
The storm
is growing.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.463
Galvin saved
those people,

30:13.507 --> 30:15.726
but the scales
had already tipped.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.990
It seems the portal, once
opened, cannot be closed.

30:24.561 --> 30:27.521
The Source is rising.

30:27.564 --> 30:30.045
So Galvin died for nothing.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.830
Not at all.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.788
Had Galvin not cured
the infection,

30:33.832 --> 30:35.877
it would have spread
throughout the world--

30:35.921 --> 30:38.488
infected humans
turned evil,

30:38.532 --> 30:39.925
killing their fellow humans,

30:39.968 --> 30:42.841
a world laid out precisely
as the Source wants it.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.669
Macy,

30:45.713 --> 30:47.933
now that he has stopped
the virus,

30:47.976 --> 30:50.370
he's given us hope.

30:50.413 --> 30:53.590
The human spirit is far stronger
than any prophecy.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.872
We're too late.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.526
We can still stop the Source.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.137
Alistair needs a vessel.
He must be using

31:18.180 --> 31:20.879
Maggie to draw out Parker.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.751
We'll never find them.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.103
There.

31:41.595 --> 31:44.598
We're in the eye
of the storm now.

31:44.641 --> 31:47.557
Are you all right, Macy?

31:47.601 --> 31:49.951
If I had used
my evil sight,

31:49.995 --> 31:52.432
we wouldn't have
released the Harbinger.

31:52.475 --> 31:55.652
Galvin would be alive
and Maggie would be okay.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.916
This isn't your fault.

31:59.221 --> 32:02.921
FIONA AND ALISTAIR: Oraculum perficiatur.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.492
Tenebrarum luminisque potestas,

32:09.536 --> 32:12.017
Ars magica omnium,

32:12.060 --> 32:15.020
Oraculum perficiatur.

32:15.063 --> 32:16.978
Guys, help!

32:17.022 --> 32:18.588
Maggie! Let her go!

32:18.632 --> 32:19.938
Don't take another step!

32:19.981 --> 32:20.939
Or Fiona

32:20.982 --> 32:21.983
will kill poor Mags.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.593
MEL:
You won't win.

32:23.637 --> 32:24.986
You don't have a willing
vessel to take on the Source.

32:25.030 --> 32:25.987
She's right.

32:26.031 --> 32:26.988
Oh, yes, he will.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.120
That's why I needed you.

32:29.686 --> 32:30.774
Light the Flame.

32:57.671 --> 32:59.803
Wha... What...

32:59.847 --> 33:02.110
What's happening to me?

33:02.154 --> 33:03.764
HARRY:
You're dying, Fiona.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.114
Macy stripped you
of your immortality.No.

33:06.158 --> 33:07.681
Let Parker take on the Source...

33:07.724 --> 33:10.162
so I can kill him.

33:10.205 --> 33:13.252
Please help me.

33:13.295 --> 33:15.863
I need to destroy magic!

33:15.906 --> 33:18.126
Please.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.522
Harry, look
what it did to me.

33:29.224 --> 33:31.183
Heal me.

33:31.226 --> 33:34.229
You know I can't.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.710
Good-bye, Fiona.

33:36.753 --> 33:39.887
I'm sorry I failed you
as a Whitelighter.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.252
MEL:
Where did she go?

34:00.212 --> 34:02.692
Uh, guys?

34:04.085 --> 34:05.956
MEL:
Fiona ignited the Flame.

34:06.000 --> 34:06.914
Maggie!

34:10.613 --> 34:13.312
Right... on... time.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.096
As always.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.707
I believe
you were born exactly

34:17.751 --> 34:18.969
on your due date.

34:19.013 --> 34:20.623
Too bad we can't ask
your mother.

34:20.667 --> 34:21.885
Shut up! Let her go!

34:21.929 --> 34:23.104
I can't.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.584
But you can.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.108
If the flames reach Maggie,

34:27.152 --> 34:28.631
then she dies.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.764
But if you step in,
you take on the Source,

34:30.807 --> 34:31.939
you can save her.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.246
Parker, don't.
The Source will destroy you.

34:34.289 --> 34:36.987
You are the only one
who can save her, Parker.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.772
A demon born
of human.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.601
Accept
your destiny.

34:41.644 --> 34:43.342
I can't watch you die, Maggie.

34:43.385 --> 34:46.084
You're not the only one.

34:51.785 --> 34:52.916
Macy, wait.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.318
Macy...

35:03.362 --> 35:04.798
Don't worry.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.757
I can control the darkness.

35:07.801 --> 35:10.108
I know it.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.675
Macy!

35:16.984 --> 35:18.986
PARKER:
Maggie.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.268
Guys.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.286
Oh, my.

36:01.333 --> 36:04.292
I exist to serve you.

36:04.336 --> 36:06.033
I am yours.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.122
Command me as you wish.

36:11.865 --> 36:14.172
Well, then...

36:41.242 --> 36:43.462
Parker, are you okay?

36:43.505 --> 36:45.159
You need to stay away
from me, Maggie.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.509
But everything's okay.
Your dad's gone.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.294
But the demon inside me
is still here, and...

36:49.337 --> 36:52.949
I don't think
I can control it much longer.

37:07.137 --> 37:10.228
You are the Source.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.447
I can't believe it.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.886
Let's go home.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.979
Niko is going

37:23.023 --> 37:23.980
to be fine.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.418
MEL:
What? How?

37:26.461 --> 37:29.334
I just made it happen.

37:29.377 --> 37:30.335
You did?

37:30.378 --> 37:31.640
Like, right now?

37:31.684 --> 37:34.077
Oh, and I wiped the memories
of everyone in town.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.078
According to them,
none of this

37:35.122 --> 37:36.297
ever happened.Macy,

37:36.341 --> 37:37.342
perhaps we should discuss...

37:37.385 --> 37:38.821
No time, Harry.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.301
There is one more thing
I have to do.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.216
Macy, this
is important.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.958
We really should talk about
these new powers that you have.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.046
HARRY:
Yeah.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.830
There's nothing to discuss.

37:47.874 --> 37:48.962
And, like I said,

37:49.005 --> 37:51.269
there is one more thing
I have to do.

37:54.359 --> 37:57.971
Should we be worried
about her?

38:13.291 --> 38:16.294
Don't worry,
Galvin.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.298
I'm going to fix you.

38:21.342 --> 38:24.954
I'm going to fix everything.
