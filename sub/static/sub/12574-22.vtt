00:00.977 --> 00:03.214
<i>Previously on Legend of the Seeker</i>

00:04.412 --> 00:07.417
<i>A tear in the veil between</i>
<i>this world and the Underworld.</i>

00:07.418 --> 00:10.589
<i>The Keeper is waging war</i>
<i>on the Land of the Living.</i>

00:10.590 --> 00:13.363
<i>He's using the rift to send</i>
<i>creatures into our world.</i>

00:13.364 --> 00:14.967
<i>And the only way</i>
<i>to close this rift</i>

00:14.968 --> 00:17.802
is for us to find
the Stone of Tears.

00:17.803 --> 00:19.868
This prophecy means
that if you continue

00:19.869 --> 00:22.374
searching for the Stone of Tears

00:22.375 --> 00:24.711
<i>you will find it. But you will</i>
<i>give it to the Keeper.</i>

00:24.712 --> 00:26.615
I don't believe
in prophecies.

00:26.616 --> 00:30.655
Sister Nicci,
bring me the Stone of Tears.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.825
From now on,
I serve only myself.

00:32.826 --> 00:35.831
<i>The Seeker could use a fighter</i>
<i>as strong as you, Dahlia.</i>

00:35.832 --> 00:37.467
We could serve him together.

00:37.468 --> 00:38.869
<i>Do you think we can trust her?</i>

00:42.076 --> 00:43.911
<i>I wish there were another way.</i>

00:43.912 --> 00:45.613
<i>Your sisters and I</i>
<i>have missed you.</i>

00:45.614 --> 00:47.849
Aah!

00:47.850 --> 00:50.588
<i>Cara attacked me.</i>
<i>She took the stone.</i>

00:50.589 --> 00:52.791
It's good to have you back.

00:52.792 --> 00:55.429
There has to be a way of undoing
whatever it was Rahl did to her.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.267
There is one way but
the results are unpredictable.

00:58.268 --> 01:01.539
<i>It's called</i>
<i>the Spell of Undoing.</i>

01:04.979 --> 01:07.983
You are now joined
as husband and wife.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.954
<i>The spell seems</i>
<i>to have changed everything.</i>

01:10.955 --> 01:13.558
<i>It's a new day in D'Hara, Zedd.</i>
<i>I have the power of Orden.</i>

01:13.559 --> 01:15.895
<i>So Richard has been able</i>
<i>to use his power wisely.</i>

01:15.896 --> 01:17.631
Where's Cara?
Who's Cara?

01:17.632 --> 01:20.202
<i>Sounds like she has a better</i>
<i>life in this world</i>

01:20.203 --> 01:21.837
<i>than she did in the other one.</i>

01:21.838 --> 01:24.441
<i>Victory has been</i>
<i>stolen from my grasp.</i>

01:24.442 --> 01:26.878
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>for you to serve me.</i>

01:26.879 --> 01:29.115
<i>Once we have</i>
<i>acquired the boxes,</i>

01:29.116 --> 01:31.652
<i>we will be able to deliver</i>
<i>the Keeper a great victory.</i>

01:31.653 --> 01:33.620
If Richard no longer
has the power of Orden,

01:33.621 --> 01:35.456
<i>then the Mord-Sith</i>
<i>and Darken Rahl</i>

01:35.457 --> 01:38.194
<i>are no longer</i>
<i>under his control.</i>

01:38.195 --> 01:39.930
Kneel before me.

01:39.931 --> 01:41.532
<i>Rahl has the power of Orden.</i>

01:41.533 --> 01:42.968
<i>He's controlling Richard.</i>

01:42.969 --> 01:44.470
I can try to reverse this spell.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.606
Do you really wanna
go back to an existence

01:46.607 --> 01:48.942
where the dead
walk among the living?

01:48.943 --> 01:50.878
The Keeper
is on the brink of victory.

01:50.879 --> 01:53.382
<i>I wish there was another way,</i>
<i>but there isn't.</i>

01:57.956 --> 02:00.025
Dahlia.

02:00.026 --> 02:01.293
She's dead.

02:04.132 --> 02:07.335
Lord Rahl wants you alive.

02:07.336 --> 02:11.807
But if you resist,
he'll settle for dead.

02:30.534 --> 02:32.869
Kahlan, don't!
If I confess her,

02:32.870 --> 02:35.171
I can command her to give Cara
the Breath of Life,

02:35.172 --> 02:36.539
and then you can perform
the spell.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.343
I'm going to perform
the spell on Dahlia instead.

02:39.344 --> 02:40.878
Why?
Because it should have

02:40.879 --> 02:44.216
the same effect on her
that it did on Cara.

02:44.217 --> 02:46.552
It'll undo all the Mord-Sith
magic that was ever done to her.

02:46.553 --> 02:49.022
And if Dahlia were never
a Mord-Sith,

02:49.023 --> 02:51.925
Darken Rahl couldn't have
used her to lure Cara away.

02:51.926 --> 02:56.564
Zedd, we've seen how
unpredictable this magic is.

02:56.565 --> 03:00.736
Kahlan, I can't give Cara back
the life she had in this world.

03:00.737 --> 03:02.638
But if this spell works,

03:02.639 --> 03:05.172
I can give her back
the life she had with us.

03:05.173 --> 03:06.740
A life she was proud of.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.848
Cara!

03:58.849 --> 04:00.315
Where's Cara?

04:02.451 --> 04:05.753
I'm right here!

04:08.790 --> 04:10.324
Thank the Spirits.

04:10.325 --> 04:14.126
I appreciate the concern,
Wizard.

04:14.127 --> 04:16.829
But it takes more than a few
banelings to kill me.

04:16.829 --> 04:19.766
That's the Cara I know.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.000
Zedd, are you all right?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.202
I'm fine. I think.

04:23.203 --> 04:25.704
Just tell me
where we are.

04:25.705 --> 04:27.339
Gilgalar.

04:27.340 --> 04:29.874
On the way to
the Pillars of Creation.

04:31.777 --> 04:33.477
Zedd, what's going on?

04:33.478 --> 04:36.446
It's a long story.

04:36.447 --> 04:39.115
Well, you'd better
tell us on the move.

04:39.116 --> 04:41.651
We need to find a safe place to
set up camp before it gets dark.

04:41.652 --> 04:43.452
Are you sure
we shouldn't keep going?

04:43.453 --> 04:44.787
Kahlan's right.

04:44.788 --> 04:46.622
The solstice
is the day after tomorrow.

04:46.623 --> 04:48.324
We need to get
to the Pillars.

04:48.325 --> 04:50.125
We'll get there in time.

04:50.126 --> 04:51.993
But not if we're so tired
that we can't fight off

04:51.994 --> 04:55.496
the next horde of banelings
that attacks us.

05:33.462 --> 05:36.496
Quite a dramatic entrance,
Nicci. Even for you.

05:36.497 --> 05:39.366
To what do I owe the pleasure?

05:39.367 --> 05:42.735
It appears you and I now
have something in common:

05:42.736 --> 05:44.837
Neither of us
serves the Keeper anymore.

05:44.838 --> 05:46.872
Hm.

05:46.873 --> 05:48.940
Tiresome old creature, isn't he?

05:48.941 --> 05:51.276
It's so hard
to keep him happy.

05:51.277 --> 05:53.612
And you won't be very happy
when the Seeker fails,

05:53.613 --> 05:56.180
and your former master gets
his hands on you again.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.715
He's not known for forgiving
those who betray him.

05:58.716 --> 06:01.952
And the Seeker
is not known for failure.

06:01.953 --> 06:04.421
Have you forgotten the Prophecy?

06:04.422 --> 06:07.223
He will deliver the stone
to the Enemy of the Light.

06:07.224 --> 06:09.458
If there is one thing
I have learned,

06:09.459 --> 06:11.961
it is never to wager
against my brother.

06:11.962 --> 06:15.231
Prophecy or not,
he will succeed.

06:18.101 --> 06:21.136
Your overconfidence
can only mean one thing:

06:21.137 --> 06:23.971
you know that Richard
already has the stone

06:23.972 --> 06:26.173
and where he's taking it.

06:26.174 --> 06:28.175
Tell me.

06:28.176 --> 06:31.145
Why in all creation
would I tell you?

06:31.146 --> 06:33.147
I can protect him.

06:33.148 --> 06:35.717
But only if you tell me
where he's going.

06:38.554 --> 06:40.120
And how do I know

06:40.121 --> 06:42.756
that you are not still
in league with the Keeper?

06:42.757 --> 06:45.092
So the great Darken Rahl

06:45.093 --> 06:46.827
is just going to wait
for his little brother

06:46.828 --> 06:48.562
to save the world?

06:48.563 --> 06:50.930
Oh, waiting's not so bad,

06:50.931 --> 06:55.434
as long as one finds amusing
ways to while away the time.

06:55.435 --> 06:57.336
Why don't you join me?

06:57.337 --> 06:59.270
The water's warm.

07:00.439 --> 07:03.107
Not as warm
as it's going to be.

07:07.713 --> 07:09.480
Where is the Seeker
taking the stone?

07:12.280 --> 07:14.715
The Pillars of Creation!

07:16.717 --> 07:20.119
Keeper, hear our prayer.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.488
We live only to serve you.

07:22.489 --> 07:25.756
Tell us, master, how to deliver
the world into darkness.

07:25.757 --> 07:27.624
Sisters!

07:27.625 --> 07:29.192
Glorious news.

07:29.193 --> 07:31.494
One of our order has spotted
the Seeker

07:31.495 --> 07:32.996
on the plains of Gilgalar,

07:32.997 --> 07:34.865
heading north,
toward the Alithian Sea.

07:34.866 --> 07:37.166
We will travel there
and intercept him.

07:39.135 --> 07:41.302
And how will
we defeat him on our own,

07:41.303 --> 07:42.968
without the Keeper's help?

07:42.969 --> 07:47.033
We summon him, Marianna,
but he does not come.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.131
I fear he has grown deaf
to our prayers.

07:49.132 --> 07:51.864
If the Keeper
will not come to us,

07:51.865 --> 07:55.697
then one of us
must go to him.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.909
Keeper?

08:07.910 --> 08:11.511
<i>Why do you</i>
<i>and your sisters call to me?</i>

08:11.512 --> 08:15.515
The Seeker is heading north
to the plains of Gilgalar.

08:15.516 --> 08:17.617
If you order your banelings
to help us,

08:17.618 --> 08:20.519
we can kill him for you.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.189
<i>I am finished with entrusting</i>
<i>my fate to underlings.</i>

08:24.190 --> 08:27.092
<i>Now that I know</i>
<i>where the Seeker is,</i>

08:27.093 --> 08:29.861
<i>I will stop him myself.</i>

08:29.862 --> 08:33.496
How, My Lord?

08:40.904 --> 08:43.304
If we can't get across, we may
not make it to the Pillars!

08:43.306 --> 08:46.074
Run!

08:56.149 --> 08:57.950
Kahlan, stop, it's too wide!

09:05.458 --> 09:08.459
Catch up with me if you can,
but I have to keep going.

09:15.132 --> 09:17.967
May the Spirits be with you.

09:33.695 --> 09:36.966
The rift extends as far
as the eye can see.

09:36.967 --> 09:40.309
We can't leave
Richard out there on his own.

09:40.310 --> 09:42.982
Then we'll just
have to go around.

09:45.221 --> 09:47.957
Nicci will die for this,
My Lord.

09:47.958 --> 09:50.926
You truly believe you
and your sisters are a match

09:50.927 --> 09:53.495
for the most powerful sorceress
in the known world?

09:53.496 --> 09:56.097
She infiltrated this temple
under your noses

09:56.098 --> 09:58.465
and almost boiled me alive.

09:58.466 --> 10:01.335
We will avenge the affront.

10:01.336 --> 10:04.905
Revenge is a petty motive,
Garen.

10:04.906 --> 10:06.673
Kill her we must, yes.

10:06.674 --> 10:09.708
But not for vengeance sake.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.843
We must kill her to ensure
my brother's victory.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.012
Because if he fails,

10:14.013 --> 10:17.815
the Keeper will
torture us all for eternity.

10:17.816 --> 10:19.917
You do not believe
Nicci intends

10:19.918 --> 10:21.651
to protect Richard
as she claimed.

10:21.652 --> 10:24.454
I believe she intends to use him
somehow to serve her own ends,

10:24.455 --> 10:26.522
whatever those may be.

10:26.523 --> 10:28.657
Since we know where
the Seeker is going,

10:28.658 --> 10:30.859
we know where Nicci will be.

10:30.860 --> 10:34.361
But you cannot defeat her alone.

10:35.763 --> 10:39.899
You will join forces with
the Seeker and his retinue.

10:39.900 --> 10:43.402
My Lord--
You heard me!

10:43.403 --> 10:45.871
In this dark hour
there is no one

10:45.872 --> 10:48.940
we can depend upon more

10:48.941 --> 10:51.876
than my fearless brother.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.667
It's all right.

12:03.668 --> 12:04.935
I'm not going to hurt you.

12:04.936 --> 12:06.469
You're one of them.

12:06.470 --> 12:07.703
One of who?

12:07.704 --> 12:09.405
Banelings.

12:09.406 --> 12:12.240
No, I'm not a baneling.

12:16.913 --> 12:18.646
I'm the Seeker.

12:18.647 --> 12:21.482
Look, the Sword of Truth.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.318
My name is Richard.

12:26.319 --> 12:27.753
What's yours?

12:29.188 --> 12:31.322
Declan.

12:31.323 --> 12:34.256
Declan, I'm going
to get you out of here.

12:35.792 --> 12:38.027
I can't leave my papa.

12:38.028 --> 12:39.162
He's alive?

12:44.836 --> 12:46.169
They killed him.

12:46.170 --> 12:49.439
My mama too.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.774
They killed everyone.

13:00.549 --> 13:03.250
I'm going to take you
someplace safe.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.421
I'm counting on you to keep
this fire going, Declan.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.623
It's a tough job,
but I think you're up to it.

13:16.828 --> 13:18.629
There's enough
food and water in here

13:18.630 --> 13:20.031
to last you
at least three days.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.898
I'll be back for you
before then.

13:21.899 --> 13:23.099
I wanna come with you.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.367
Oh, I wish I could take you,

13:25.368 --> 13:28.137
but coming with me is much more
dangerous than staying here.

13:29.973 --> 13:33.375
What if you never come back?

13:38.414 --> 13:41.616
See this?

13:41.617 --> 13:44.651
It's the Stone of Tears.

13:44.652 --> 13:47.684
I'm bringing it
to the Pillars of Creation.

13:47.685 --> 13:51.387
Tomorrow, when the sun
is at its highest,

13:51.388 --> 13:54.189
its light will
pass through the stone

13:54.190 --> 13:57.258
and repair the veil
to the Underworld.

13:57.259 --> 13:59.560
When that happens,

13:59.561 --> 14:01.362
there'll be no more rifts,

14:01.363 --> 14:04.297
no more banelings,

14:04.298 --> 14:06.432
and the Keeper
will be sealed up

14:06.433 --> 14:09.435
where he will never
hurt you again.

14:12.672 --> 14:15.173
Now, I'm counting on you
to keep this fire going.

14:18.677 --> 14:20.377
Can you do that for me?

14:39.061 --> 14:40.427
Whoa.

14:45.699 --> 14:47.133
It's all right.

14:47.134 --> 14:49.902
They couldn't get across
this way either.

14:49.903 --> 14:51.536
Hyah!

15:21.726 --> 15:23.493
Master?

15:25.229 --> 15:29.332
Kneel before the Keeper
of the Underworld.

15:42.791 --> 15:44.559
Master, forgive our confusion.

15:45.124 --> 15:48.492
We felt your spirit here,
in the World of the Living.

15:48.493 --> 15:51.728
We were drawn to you,
like ships to a beacon.

15:51.729 --> 15:54.564
You will tell no one
of my presence in this world.

15:54.565 --> 15:56.599
Never, master.

15:56.600 --> 16:00.001
But in this mortal flesh
you could be hurt or killed.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.802
Let us protect you.

16:01.803 --> 16:06.106
Why do I need
you to protect me

16:06.107 --> 16:08.108
when I have the Seeker?

16:08.109 --> 16:10.810
I don't understand.

16:10.811 --> 16:13.612
I took the body of this boy,

16:13.613 --> 16:16.385
who was killed
by my banelings,

16:16.386 --> 16:19.122
because I knew
that Richard Cypher

16:19.123 --> 16:23.125
could never turn away
from a helpless child.

16:24.594 --> 16:28.297
You will kill him
and then take the stone.

16:28.298 --> 16:30.699
No.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.335
The time has come
to rely on Prophecy.

16:33.336 --> 16:37.138
Soon, the Seeker will hand me

16:37.139 --> 16:39.307
the Stone of Tears.

16:41.610 --> 16:44.312
Master,
I am overjoyed to hear it.

16:44.313 --> 16:46.247
But what of the second Prophecy?

16:46.248 --> 16:49.818
As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

16:49.819 --> 16:52.053
you cannot win.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.755
Then it will be your task
to stop her heart.

16:55.756 --> 16:57.523
Gladly, master.

16:57.524 --> 17:00.658
Her destination is the same
as the Seeker's:

17:00.659 --> 17:02.826
the Pillars of Creation.

17:04.162 --> 17:06.628
Now go there

17:06.630 --> 17:08.931
and lie in wait for her.

17:08.932 --> 17:11.464
As you wish, master.

17:30.445 --> 17:32.146
Declan, I told you,

17:32.147 --> 17:33.847
you can't come with me.
It's not safe.

17:33.848 --> 17:36.684
I was scared by myself
in the cave.

17:36.685 --> 17:39.319
I kept hearing noises.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.456
Declan, you're slowing me down.
I need to get where I'm going,

17:42.457 --> 17:44.558
and I can't have you
tagging along.

17:47.828 --> 17:50.462
I'm sorry.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.616
Sister Thea.

18:15.918 --> 18:18.086
It's been a long time.

18:18.087 --> 18:19.653
Please, don't kill me.

18:19.654 --> 18:20.986
Why are you following me?

18:20.987 --> 18:23.921
Did the prelate think I would
be that easy to assassinate?

18:23.922 --> 18:25.819
I'm on your side, Verna,
I swear.

18:25.820 --> 18:27.985
I've been searching for you
for months,

18:27.986 --> 18:29.620
all the way from
the Old World.

18:29.621 --> 18:31.322
Why?

18:31.323 --> 18:32.756
To tell you that
the Creator has sent

18:32.757 --> 18:34.057
a new Prophecy about the Seeker.

18:35.893 --> 18:37.560
What does this new Prophecy say?

18:37.561 --> 18:40.629
The words themselves, not
the prelate's interpretation.

18:40.630 --> 18:42.631
"On the eve of the solstice,

18:42.632 --> 18:44.233
"in the mask of a child,

18:44.234 --> 18:46.368
"will the Keeper walk among us.

18:46.369 --> 18:50.438
And by his hand will
the Seeker be blindly led."

18:50.439 --> 18:52.305
The solstice is tomorrow.

18:52.306 --> 18:54.107
That's why
I needed to find you.

18:54.108 --> 18:55.707
So you could warn the Seeker.

18:55.708 --> 18:59.413
I haven't seen Richard since
he left the Old World.

18:59.414 --> 19:02.449
But I may know a way
to help him.

19:02.450 --> 19:04.650
I'm not sensing any rifts ahead.

19:04.651 --> 19:07.686
I think we may have
made it around.

19:07.687 --> 19:10.422
Now all we have to do is
double back 20 leagues and--

19:25.870 --> 19:28.138
Wait. If I confess her,

19:28.139 --> 19:29.572
we'll have control
over her powers.

19:29.573 --> 19:31.573
We'd be able to protect
Richard from anything.

19:57.599 --> 20:00.767
Command me, mistress.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.904
Kill the Mord-Sith.

20:18.481 --> 20:21.282
I will find her and kill her
for you, mistress.

20:21.283 --> 20:22.917
Forget her.
Where's the Seeker?

20:22.918 --> 20:26.119
He jumped across the rift.
He's at least a day ahead of us.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.087
Then we'll have to hurry,
won't we?

20:29.489 --> 20:30.922
Hyah!

20:36.860 --> 20:38.694
How could she
have confessed Kahlan?

20:38.695 --> 20:40.929
She must have absorbed
enough of Kahlan's han

20:40.930 --> 20:42.563
to use it against her.

20:42.564 --> 20:44.864
Then if we kill Nicci,
Kahlan will be released.

20:44.865 --> 20:48.233
We have to catch up
to them first.

20:51.522 --> 20:54.424
The hour of the solstice
draws near.

20:54.425 --> 20:57.060
What can I do to help,
with so little time?

20:57.061 --> 20:58.660
Send a message
by Journey Book

20:58.661 --> 21:00.761
to your brothers
in all the provinces.

21:00.762 --> 21:02.762
Tell them to search
for the Seeker.

21:02.763 --> 21:05.098
If they see
he is traveling with a child,

21:05.099 --> 21:08.033
they will know
the Prophecy is true.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.036
And they must
kill the child.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.273
Verna,
the brothers of this order

21:15.274 --> 21:17.641
have devoted themselves
to protecting all life.

21:17.642 --> 21:21.177
Prophecies are seldom as clear
as this one, Brother Joseph.

21:21.178 --> 21:24.346
The Seeker is being deceived
by the Keeper

21:24.347 --> 21:26.114
in the form of a child.

21:26.115 --> 21:28.416
As soon as your brothers
find him,

21:28.417 --> 21:30.351
they must act
without hesitation.

21:30.352 --> 21:33.688
But if you are wrong, they will
be killing an innocent child.

21:33.689 --> 21:36.290
And if I am right,

21:36.291 --> 21:40.426
they will be putting an end
to the Keeper forever.

21:44.197 --> 21:47.835
The Creator has put a sword
in our hands, Joseph.

21:47.836 --> 21:50.371
Are we going to
lay it down,

21:50.372 --> 21:54.207
or raise it in battle?

22:16.056 --> 22:17.756
Hyah!

22:17.757 --> 22:19.958
We'll never catch them
on foot.

22:19.959 --> 22:21.993
Don't you know
some sort of spell

22:21.994 --> 22:23.594
to make us move faster?

22:23.595 --> 22:26.765
Maybe we don't need a spell.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.301
Maybe we can
borrow some horses.

22:30.302 --> 22:32.503
Or steal them.

22:34.105 --> 22:36.506
Mord-Sith!

22:57.241 --> 23:00.709
Lord Rahl has commanded us
to join forces with you.

23:01.442 --> 23:04.243
Out of the goodness
of his hollow heart?

23:04.244 --> 23:06.845
Out of an instinct
for survival.

23:06.846 --> 23:08.546
If the Keeper wins,

23:08.547 --> 23:10.681
Lord Rahl will be returned
to the Underworld

23:10.682 --> 23:14.284
to face eternal suffering at
the hands of his former master.

23:14.285 --> 23:17.053
Well, thank you
for your generous offer.

23:17.054 --> 23:19.255
But I have a better idea.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.423
We'll just take your horses.

23:20.447 --> 23:23.082
Cara.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.150
You can't seriously be
considering this.

23:25.151 --> 23:27.519
If we fight them,
we could lose.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.753
And they have four more
pair of hands

23:29.754 --> 23:31.621
that can deflect
Nicci's magic.

23:37.160 --> 23:41.463
So who's in charge here?

23:41.464 --> 23:42.464
I am.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.934
So who's in charge here?

23:46.935 --> 23:49.336
You are.

23:49.337 --> 23:51.738
Then let's ride.

24:00.948 --> 24:03.849
Richard's boots made these
tracks, mistress.

24:03.850 --> 24:06.051
But they're at least
a half a day old.

24:06.052 --> 24:08.152
He's been here and gone.

24:08.153 --> 24:10.921
That way.

24:10.922 --> 24:13.690
Mistress,
I know Richard.

24:13.691 --> 24:15.891
He's clever.

24:15.892 --> 24:17.526
He may have realized
you're tracking him

24:17.527 --> 24:19.527
and be setting a trap
for you.

24:19.528 --> 24:22.363
I couldn't bear it if
any harm came to you.

24:22.364 --> 24:23.997
Stop groveling.

24:23.998 --> 24:25.899
The Seeker isn't
going to kill me.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.768
He's going to serve me.

24:28.769 --> 24:30.169
How?

24:30.170 --> 24:31.937
He trusts you.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.138
Once we've caught up to him,

24:33.139 --> 24:35.039
you'll get close enough
to confess him.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.041
That's why I didn't take
all of your han.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.742
I will do
whatever you wish.

24:38.743 --> 24:40.310
But how is the Seeker
going to serve you

24:40.311 --> 24:42.511
if he's confessed to me?

24:42.512 --> 24:46.480
You will order him to give me
the Stone of Tears.

24:46.481 --> 24:49.115
It has the power
to bestow immortality

24:49.116 --> 24:51.350
even while the Keeper
does me the great favor

24:51.351 --> 24:54.319
of destroying all the rest
of the pathetic life

24:54.320 --> 24:57.388
that inhabits this world.

24:57.389 --> 25:00.260
You will order Richard
to be my consort,

25:00.261 --> 25:03.930
and he and I will start
a new race in our image.

25:03.931 --> 25:06.466
A people that follow my will

25:06.467 --> 25:09.302
and my will alone.

25:11.405 --> 25:12.905
Oh.

25:12.906 --> 25:14.406
But, mistress,

25:14.407 --> 25:16.942
if we don't catch up
to Richard in time--

25:16.943 --> 25:20.044
That's why you're gonna
help me slow him down.

26:01.545 --> 26:02.779
Hop down, hop down.

26:17.091 --> 26:19.392
Richard, are you all right?

26:25.598 --> 26:27.865
I'm blind.

26:30.819 --> 26:31.952
Does it hurt?

26:31.953 --> 26:33.220
I'll be all right.

26:35.323 --> 26:38.292
Give me the Stone of Tears.

26:38.293 --> 26:39.527
Declan--

26:39.528 --> 26:40.728
You can't get it
to the Pillars

26:40.729 --> 26:44.165
if you can't see
where you're going.

26:44.166 --> 26:47.068
I'll take it there for you.

26:48.370 --> 26:50.904
You're very brave.

26:52.874 --> 26:54.607
But I can't let you
take the stone.

26:54.608 --> 26:58.141
You've seen how dangerous
it is for anyone who has it.

26:58.142 --> 27:00.574
How will you make it
if you can't see?

27:00.575 --> 27:03.610
Well, I know which
direction to travel.

27:03.611 --> 27:07.113
But I need somebody
to be my eyes.

27:18.088 --> 27:20.322
These tracks are fresh.

27:20.323 --> 27:23.258
One horse carrying two riders.

27:25.328 --> 27:28.329
If we're lucky, Nicci and Kahlan
are still down there.

27:29.497 --> 27:32.232
I found some
bread and cheese.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.668
But you deserve
so much better, mistress.

27:34.669 --> 27:35.969
Mother Confessor!

27:38.139 --> 27:40.506
The Creator has led me to you.

27:40.507 --> 27:41.941
Who are you?

27:41.942 --> 27:43.909
I am Brother Edward,
of the Cloister of Karan-Rah.

27:43.910 --> 27:45.710
I have received a message
by Journey Book

27:45.711 --> 27:48.046
that the Seeker
is in great danger.

27:48.047 --> 27:49.747
What kind of danger?

27:49.748 --> 27:51.548
There is a new Prophecy,

27:51.549 --> 27:53.883
sent by the Creator herself.

27:53.884 --> 27:56.184
"On the eve of the solstice,

27:56.185 --> 27:58.620
"in the mask of a child,
will the Keeper walk among us.

27:58.621 --> 28:02.357
And by his hand will
the Seeker be blindly led."

28:02.358 --> 28:05.325
Mistress,
we blinded the Seeker.

28:05.326 --> 28:06.660
If he is with the Keeper, then--

28:06.661 --> 28:08.862
then he has no way
to defend himself.

28:08.863 --> 28:11.431
What are you talking about?
Where is the Seeker?

28:13.266 --> 28:15.400
If the Keeper walks
among the living,

28:15.401 --> 28:17.735
we have no time to waste.
Yes, mistress.

28:32.349 --> 28:33.449
Mistress!

28:36.952 --> 28:37.919
Now!

28:45.829 --> 28:47.729
No!

28:53.291 --> 28:55.559
She's in the Con Dar.

28:58.495 --> 29:01.095
Command us, mistress.

29:01.096 --> 29:02.596
Kill each other.

29:07.033 --> 29:09.400
Mistress!

29:17.375 --> 29:19.142
Be very careful.

29:19.143 --> 29:20.744
If she sees us,
she'll confess us.

29:20.745 --> 29:22.478
Not if we finish off
Nicci first.

29:31.052 --> 29:32.319
I will save you, mistress.

29:38.758 --> 29:39.991
It's too late.

29:39.992 --> 29:42.762
Then I will avenge you.

29:42.763 --> 29:44.598
Forget revenge.

29:44.599 --> 29:46.434
Bring me the stone.

29:46.435 --> 29:49.303
If its magic is powerful enough
to grant eternal life,

29:49.304 --> 29:52.272
it may revive me
even after I'm dead.

29:52.273 --> 29:55.008
Go. Find the Seeker quickly.

29:55.009 --> 29:56.075
Yes, mistress.

30:07.885 --> 30:09.819
She's already dead.

30:09.820 --> 30:12.589
Then Kahlan is released
from confession?

30:15.926 --> 30:17.459
Kahlan, we're here.

30:19.529 --> 30:20.462
Uh...

30:25.200 --> 30:27.534
Hyah!

30:27.535 --> 30:29.835
How is she still in the Con Dar?

30:29.836 --> 30:31.703
Maybe because Nicci

30:31.704 --> 30:34.371
used Kahlan's own magic
to confess her.

30:34.372 --> 30:37.207
The only way to free Kahlan
is to kill her,

30:37.208 --> 30:39.875
then bring her back with
the Breath of Life.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.452
<i>She was moving too fast.</i>

30:54.453 --> 30:56.255
No. I hesitated.

30:56.256 --> 30:57.557
Because for some stupid moment,

30:57.558 --> 30:59.026
I was worried
I couldn't revive her.

30:59.027 --> 31:00.494
She was your friend.

31:00.495 --> 31:03.330
That's what you people have done
to me. Made me weak.

31:03.331 --> 31:06.299
No, Cara.
Your hesitation wasn't weakness,

31:06.300 --> 31:07.768
it was a strength.

31:07.769 --> 31:10.504
An instinct to preserve life
rather than snuff it out.

31:10.505 --> 31:14.039
And without that instinct,
what are we fighting for?

31:17.576 --> 31:18.710
Hyah!

31:24.148 --> 31:26.215
It's too narrow.

31:26.216 --> 31:27.850
Maybe we can find another way.

31:27.851 --> 31:29.451
Just watch your step.
You'll be fine.

31:31.987 --> 31:33.821
Richard, I'm falling!
Give me your hand!

31:33.822 --> 31:36.756
Richard!!

31:38.892 --> 31:41.559
Are you all right?
My foot's caught!

31:41.560 --> 31:42.927
I can't move.

31:42.928 --> 31:44.262
Is there another way down?

31:45.931 --> 31:49.266
A path,
20 paces ahead of you.

31:59.643 --> 32:02.676
Richard,
there's a man with a knife!

32:02.677 --> 32:05.012
He's going to kill me!

32:11.485 --> 32:13.419
Declan, are you all right?

32:15.355 --> 32:17.523
I knew you would protect me.

32:29.734 --> 32:33.503
I can smell the sea.
We must be close.

32:33.504 --> 32:36.172
We're not close, Richard.

32:36.173 --> 32:38.073
We're here.

32:46.514 --> 32:49.183
How high is the sun?

32:49.184 --> 32:52.386
Almost right above
our heads.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.688
Then we don't have much time.
Come on.

33:03.463 --> 33:05.030
Richard!

33:05.031 --> 33:06.098
Kahlan.

33:09.869 --> 33:12.804
Kahlan, we made it!

33:21.178 --> 33:22.711
Declan, what's happening?

33:26.048 --> 33:28.115
Richard,
the Mother Confessor,

33:28.116 --> 33:29.350
she's being attacked,

33:29.351 --> 33:31.652
by women in red robes.

33:31.653 --> 33:33.053
Sisters of The Dark.

33:42.861 --> 33:44.727
Here.

33:46.596 --> 33:48.997
Take the stone.

33:50.599 --> 33:52.733
Go to the Pillars.

33:52.734 --> 33:54.067
Fast.

33:54.068 --> 33:56.702
Don't worry, Richard.

33:56.703 --> 33:59.104
I'll take it
where it needs to go.

34:12.815 --> 34:15.452
Kahlan!

34:23.029 --> 34:24.896
Kill your sisters!

35:45.870 --> 35:47.237
Kahlan?

35:48.772 --> 35:50.139
Kahlan, you all right?

35:53.776 --> 35:55.576
Give me the stone.

35:55.577 --> 35:57.577
Kahlan, what are you doing?

36:00.248 --> 36:03.284
How can you disobey me?
Give me the stone!

36:03.285 --> 36:06.319
I don't have it, but it's all
right. I gave it to a boy.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.920
He's taking it
to the Pillars.

36:10.156 --> 36:12.857
No!

36:26.941 --> 36:28.607
Kahlan,

36:28.608 --> 36:31.176
I think you must be in
the Con Dar. Listen to me.

36:31.177 --> 36:34.212
That boy is the Keeper!

36:34.213 --> 36:36.348
You have fulfilled the Prophecy!

36:36.349 --> 36:40.818
Now I can never
save my mistress.

37:08.842 --> 37:12.043
I know it wasn't you
who did this.

37:15.414 --> 37:16.881
I love you.

37:39.936 --> 37:42.437
Richard.

37:42.438 --> 37:45.039
Richard!

37:45.040 --> 37:46.440
Richard?

37:57.317 --> 37:59.818
What have I done?

38:01.054 --> 38:02.988
What have I done?

38:30.473 --> 38:32.674
Kahlan!

38:34.177 --> 38:37.512
Cara! Hurry, I killed him!

39:28.618 --> 39:30.352
I failed.

39:30.353 --> 39:32.220
I gave the stone away.

39:38.059 --> 39:39.860
It seems we have another.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.399
It may not be too late.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.294
No!

41:14.087 --> 41:17.055
Richard,
we've done it.

41:42.442 --> 41:46.878
Welcome back from the dead,
Nicci.

41:52.184 --> 41:54.552
I have great plans for you,

41:54.553 --> 41:59.090
now that it appears my brother
has defeated the Keeper.

41:59.091 --> 42:01.459
But first,

42:01.460 --> 42:05.762
I'm going to draw you
a nice, warm bath.

42:32.256 --> 42:33.990
The mark of the Keeper,

42:33.991 --> 42:35.992
it's gone.

42:35.993 --> 42:39.095
Because we defeated him.

42:43.300 --> 42:46.502
Richard, I am so sorry.

42:46.503 --> 42:48.971
There's nothing
to be sorry for.

42:48.972 --> 42:52.074
I killed you.

42:52.075 --> 42:55.310
I tried to confess you.

42:57.115 --> 42:59.050
It didn't work.

43:01.220 --> 43:04.223
How is that possible?
For the same reason

43:04.224 --> 43:06.659
you were brought out of
the Con Dar when Richard died.

43:08.095 --> 43:12.098
For the same reason that
your tears formed a new stone.

43:12.099 --> 43:15.602
Because there is no magic
in all the world more powerful

43:15.603 --> 43:18.339
than the love you and Richard
have for each other.
