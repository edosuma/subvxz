00:02.045 --> 00:02.915
Previously on "Mike & Molly.."

00:03.003 --> 00:04.178
I'm going out with Molly.

00:04.265 --> 00:06.049
Really? Why am I
just hearing about this?

00:06.136 --> 00:08.573
Oh, I'm sorry. Haven't you been
followin' my Facebook page?

00:09.922 --> 00:11.707
- I-I live alone.
- Mmm.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.752
I like to spend time
with my friends.

00:13.839 --> 00:14.753
- Ti--
- Just a sec.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.017
Ow!

00:17.104 --> 00:20.716
Sorry, but this nose hair
was driving me crazy!

00:20.803 --> 00:22.500
[Mike]
'She yanked a hair
out of my nose'

00:22.587 --> 00:23.849
started a fight with the waiter

00:23.936 --> 00:26.548
and then passed out
on the crapper.

00:26.635 --> 00:29.594
Oh. I'm sorry. I guess you're
never gonna see her again.

00:29.681 --> 00:32.032
Are you kidding?

00:32.119 --> 00:33.903
I'm gonna marry that girl.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.861
Oh, this is Molly,
she's a friend of mine.

00:40.518 --> 00:43.782
Hi. I'm Molly,
Mike's friend.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.697
I was hoping to lose
a little weight first

00:45.784 --> 00:47.482
so you'd be turned on by me.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.092
How much weight
are you talking about?

00:49.179 --> 00:52.356
I don't know, 160 pounds.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.575
I don't know
if you've noticed this

00:53.662 --> 00:55.968
but I'm not exactly perfect.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.361
You are to me.

00:57.448 --> 00:58.493
Would you come inside
and tell me

00:58.580 --> 01:00.016
what you're so upset about?

01:00.103 --> 01:01.583
Oh, you'd love for me
to come inside, wouldn't you?

01:01.670 --> 01:05.282
Maybe hang my coat up in your
closet full of skeletons!

01:05.369 --> 01:08.285
So you met Kyle, look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about him

01:08.372 --> 01:09.765
but it was a long time ago.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.375
You were gonna stand at an altar

01:11.462 --> 01:13.073
and promised to be
with him forever.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.640
I can't even get you
to join Costco with me!

01:17.033 --> 01:18.469
Mike, I can't accept this.

01:18.556 --> 01:19.949
Why not,
it's our first Christmas

01:20.036 --> 01:21.385
and I wanted to get you
something special.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.953
Absolutely not.
This is way too expensive.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.433
I don't care.
I want you to have it.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.869
- But I don't want it.
- Yes, you do.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.000
- No, I don't.
- Hey, I love you.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.438
And you can't
put a price on love!

01:30.525 --> 01:31.830
Wait a second.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.095
- You love me?
- Absolutely.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.835
We got a good thing here.

01:36.922 --> 01:39.099
We don't need to ruin it
by talking about marriage.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.188
Well, I don't think
we'd ruin it.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.450
[Mike]
'I love you, Molly.'

01:42.537 --> 01:43.755
I also want you to know that

01:43.842 --> 01:46.410
I'm really happy
with what we've got.

01:46.497 --> 01:49.370
Absolutely, and there's
no reason to rush into anything

01:49.457 --> 01:52.068
until we're
both sure we're ready.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.852
It would appear I'm ready.

01:53.939 --> 01:54.897
[children giggling]

01:54.984 --> 01:56.116
Shut up.
Shut up!

01:58.161 --> 02:00.511
[sighs]
Really?

02:00.598 --> 02:03.688
Molly Flynn, will you marry me?

02:09.651 --> 02:12.219
- Is that a yes?
- Yeah,yes.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.267
I can't believe
it's actually mine.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.922
That's because it's not.

02:20.009 --> 02:24.318
But it will be after 48
easy monthly payments.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.885
It might have been cheaper
to buy you an engagement car.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.803
- I love you, Mike.
- I love you, Mrs. Biggs.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.110
Oh, that's sweet.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.330
But about that, uh..

02:36.417 --> 02:39.594
Would you be terribly hurt
if I didn't take your last name?

02:39.681 --> 02:40.725
What?

02:40.812 --> 02:42.074
I just think it's better for me

02:42.162 --> 02:44.512
professionally to
keep my last name.

02:44.599 --> 02:45.904
Professionally?
You're a teacher.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.776
Just go to the chalkboard,
erase Ms. Flynn

02:47.863 --> 02:49.386
and write Mrs. Biggs.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.909
Really?

02:50.996 --> 02:53.390
I'm rubenesque,
I teach fourth graders

02:53.477 --> 02:56.480
you want me to go in there
with the last name Biggs?

02:56.567 --> 02:58.700
Yeah, fourth graders
are a pretty hateful bunch.

02:58.787 --> 03:01.659
I remember how much we tortured
poor old Mr. Jahboner.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.837
Jahboner?
You gotta be kidding me.

03:05.924 --> 03:09.014
Nope. And he taught wood shop.

03:09.101 --> 03:11.495
Well, you live by the sword,
you die by the sword.

03:11.582 --> 03:13.280
[both laughing]

03:15.456 --> 03:17.719
So you-you're okay with me
keeping my name?

03:17.806 --> 03:19.373
Yeah, that's fine.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.592
Mrs. Biggs reminds me
of my mother anyway

03:21.679 --> 03:23.246
and that's a real
jahboner killer.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.639
[chuckling]

03:24.726 --> 03:25.857
Thank you.

03:27.859 --> 03:31.298
So, are we thinking about
a church wedding or..

03:31.385 --> 03:32.734
Actually, I was thinking,
does your bra

03:32.821 --> 03:34.518
unhook in the front or the back?

03:37.652 --> 03:39.958
On the other hand,
having an outdoor ceremony

03:40.045 --> 03:42.744
could be really beautiful.
Maybe Lincoln Park.

03:42.831 --> 03:45.921
Spring time,
the flowers are gorgeous.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.228
- Sure.
- So, it's settled.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.795
- Spring time, Lincoln Park.
- Great.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.493
Ah..

03:54.799 --> 03:57.628
But if we want to have
an indoor reception

03:57.715 --> 03:59.935
we've got to,
you know, set up a banquet hall

04:00.022 --> 04:01.806
at least a year in advance.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.679
Great, then we got
plenty of time.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.508
Okay. Then we're talking
a year from now?

04:07.595 --> 04:10.772
Yeah. We'll start ironin' out
the details a year from now.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.078
No, wa-wait, wait, wait, wait.
Roll up your tongue.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.648
Are you, are you saying

04:17.735 --> 04:20.042
that we're not gonna get married
for at least two years?

04:20.129 --> 04:22.436
- No, I'm not saying that.
- Well, what are you saying?

04:22.523 --> 04:25.352
I'm trying not to say anything.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.789
Look, the important thing is
you have a ring on your finger

04:27.876 --> 04:30.879
that says I'm marrying
the man of my dreams.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.534
And the bra is off!

04:33.621 --> 04:35.057
See, I told you
you could do it.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.406
I don't have to
switch to Velcro.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.973

04:38.060 --> 04:43.239
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

04:43.326 --> 04:47.069
♪ I see love ♪♪

04:56.252 --> 04:57.340
[instrumental music]

04:57.427 --> 04:59.081
That was a nice
shindig last night.

04:59.168 --> 05:02.214
Yeah. I can't believe my
little girl's getting married.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.043
Me, too. I thought she was
a lesbian when I first met her.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.047
- Morning.
- Morning, buttercup.

05:09.134 --> 05:12.312
Where's your bigger half?

05:12.399 --> 05:13.965
He left for work.

05:14.052 --> 05:17.229
So, how was your first night
as an engaged woman?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.319
'Hmm?
It's different now, right?'

05:19.406 --> 05:21.669
I know when Vince
proposed to me

05:21.756 --> 05:24.324
we connected
on a whole new level.

05:24.411 --> 05:28.066
That was a God-given
stiffy that night, too.

05:28.153 --> 05:31.896
No pills. Just pure adrenaline.

05:31.983 --> 05:35.378
You get that
she's my mother, right?

05:35.465 --> 05:37.293
Which reminds me,
if you need someone

05:37.380 --> 05:39.948
to walk you down the aisle,
I would be honored.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.907
No, 'tis I, the lesbian,
that would be honored.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.304
I told you your voice carries.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.654
When Mike and I set a date

05:50.741 --> 05:53.004
I will definitely
consider your offer.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.310
Try to avoid the summer.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.182
We Morantos are a sweaty people

05:57.269 --> 06:01.056
and I don't want
my hair paint to run.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.493
Yeah, and for me,
try to avoid the winter months.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.277
When my little girl
gets married

06:05.365 --> 06:08.846
I want to wear something
low-cut, show off my bouncy Cs.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.285
Like a mother does.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.505
We're not even talking
specifics yet.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.202
Don't let him drag
the engagement out.

06:17.289 --> 06:19.944
Guys will take a free meal
as long as they can get it.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.469
And by free meal,
I mean copulation.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.560
It's gonna be a long
walk down that aisle.

06:27.604 --> 06:30.477
[instrumental music]

06:31.565 --> 06:33.044
Man, I can't get over it.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.829
My best friend
is getting married.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.657
Eh, wasn't 'bout a year ago,
you were whining and crying

06:36.744 --> 06:37.658
about how lonely you were.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.137
Yep.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.618
Sittin' in your sad,
little apartment all weekend

06:41.705 --> 06:44.055
one hand down a bag of Doritos,
the other one down your pants.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.276
Yeah, well,
those were some dark days.

06:47.363 --> 06:49.234
Dark? You, sir,
are an inspiration

06:49.321 --> 06:51.193
to overweight masturbators
everywhere.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.196
You know what,
why don't you save the rest

06:54.283 --> 06:56.067
for your best man speech.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.852
So it's official,
I'm your best man?

06:57.939 --> 07:00.681
And that is the real tragedy
of my life.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.206
I'm honored.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.729
So, is it safe to assume
that you won't be

07:05.816 --> 07:07.339
goin' fishin' with us
this weekend?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.298
- Why wouldn't I go?
- You're engaged now.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.560
You can't just be doing
what you want

07:10.647 --> 07:12.606
and making your own decisions
and stuff.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.783
Excuse me, but my life
is still very much my own.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.524
I can come and go as I please.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.569
Mike Flynn is his own man.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.397
- Mike Flynn?
- Biggs, I said Biggs.

07:21.484 --> 07:24.313
Everybody heard Biggs.
Shut up.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.621
Sounded like Flynn
from over here.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.361
It's a slip of the tongue.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.581
The point is, I'm goin' fishin'.
Hey, Samuel, you want to come?

07:31.668 --> 07:33.496
We got a big tent
and plenty of sleeping bags.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.237
Thank you, but that's
the same pitch they used

07:35.324 --> 07:37.674
to get me into a refugee camp
in Africa.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.112
Come on, you have a few beers,
tell some stories

07:41.199 --> 07:42.679
you know, bond as men.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.246
That's the same pitch
they used to get me

07:44.333 --> 07:46.204
to the gay tent
in the refugee camp.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.600
Fool me once.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.822
All I'm saying is,
if we're gonna have any shot

07:54.909 --> 07:57.520
at booking a nice place,
we need to start looking now.

07:57.607 --> 08:00.305
Okay.
Wait. What are we looking for?

08:01.872 --> 08:04.396
A place to have our wedding.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.398
Sure. We're gonna need that.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.185
Yeah, otherwise we're gonna
end up getting married

08:10.272 --> 08:11.447
in your mother's backyard

08:11.534 --> 08:14.711
and having the reception
at the sizzler.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.497
Sizzler?
Is that a real option?

08:19.716 --> 08:23.111
Hey.
Joyce, I'm downstairs!

08:23.198 --> 08:25.113
- 'Be right there!'
- Take your time!

08:25.200 --> 08:27.071
I'm gonna talk to the kids.

08:28.464 --> 08:31.075
Hey, lovebirds.
How's things?

08:31.162 --> 08:33.338
Vince, I don't want to be rude
but we're kind of

08:33.425 --> 08:34.862
kinda in the middle
of something.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.646
I'm not here.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.696
So, can we at least decide
on a time of year?

08:42.783 --> 08:45.263
Is this about the wedding?

08:45.350 --> 08:47.744
Do you believe it? We've only
been engaged for 24 hours.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.790
She's already trying to
fit me for a tux.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.575
He is gonna fluctuate
size-wise.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.055
You don't want him
walking down the aisle

08:54.142 --> 08:55.883
looking like the hulk got mad.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.844
I'm just trying
to narrow things down.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.498
I mean, if you want
the good weather

09:02.585 --> 09:04.718
there's only a handful
of weekends to choose from.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.198
She's right, and if she's
gonna do all the planning

09:07.285 --> 09:09.549
you can at least try to be
a little accommodating.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.468
- Thank you, Vince.
- Here to help.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.168
Maybe we can drive
around this weekend

09:20.255 --> 09:21.735
and check out some places.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.127
Oh, I can't, uh

09:23.214 --> 09:25.260
I'm goin' fishin'
with the guys this weekend.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.958
This weekend? Oh.
Why didn't you say something?

09:28.045 --> 09:30.308
Well, it's not like I need
your permission, is it?

09:30.395 --> 09:34.312
No. I, I think you could've
said something before now.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.966
You invited me a week ago

09:36.053 --> 09:37.577
and have yet
to tell your fiance?

09:39.883 --> 09:41.581
That does not bode well,
my friend.

09:43.104 --> 09:46.411
- Vin, you ready to go?
- Yes, he needs to go.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.545
Let me know
when you figure out the details.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.591
I can get you a deal
on peel-and-eat shrimp

09:51.678 --> 09:53.941
and a swan that's trained
to be a ring bearer.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.509
They can get swans to do that?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.599
Hey, you wire their beaks shut
and drug 'em

09:59.686 --> 10:01.992
they're a very
cooperative species.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.083
By the way, I'm goin' fishin'
this weekend.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.086
What? Why the hell am I just
hearing about this now?

10:14.135 --> 10:16.006
[alarm beeping]

10:19.140 --> 10:20.489
Mike.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.361
Mike.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.018
Get up and go fishin'.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.977
[beeping continues]

10:34.416 --> 10:37.158
H-honey, not now.
I'm sleeping.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.073
Get up.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.683
What?

10:40.770 --> 10:42.598
Get out of here
and go fishin'.

10:42.685 --> 10:46.428
Oh, right, fishin'.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.691
Honey, I put a brochure
in your tackle box

10:48.778 --> 10:51.259
from this reception hall
near Lake Geneva.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.958
I thought maybe you could check
it out when you go up there.

10:55.045 --> 10:58.092
Oh, geez, Molly, I'm not going
to have time for that nonsense.

11:03.401 --> 11:04.925
[Molly]
'Talking about our wedding
is nonsense?'

11:05.012 --> 11:06.883
[Mike]
'It is at 4:00 in the morning.'

11:06.970 --> 11:08.102
[Molly]
'I'm sorry.
What's a good time for you?'

11:08.189 --> 11:09.581
[Mike]
'Hey, what do you want from me?'

11:09.669 --> 11:11.322
'I gave you a ring,
told you I loved you.'

11:11.409 --> 11:13.107
[Molly]
'You just gave me
a ring to shut me up?'

11:13.194 --> 11:14.761
[Mike]
'Well, if I did,
it's clearly not working.'

11:14.848 --> 11:16.676
- 'Oh!
- 'Wait, that came out wrong.'

11:16.763 --> 11:18.242
[Molly]
'Yeah, how wrong
did it come out?'

11:18.329 --> 11:19.548
[Mike]
'Ah, come on,
don't start this..'

11:19.635 --> 11:21.550
Anybody want
a breakfast burrito?

11:21.637 --> 11:23.117
- Sure.
- I could eat.

11:27.164 --> 11:27.948
[instrumental music]

11:28.035 --> 11:29.123
[sighs]

11:33.823 --> 11:36.130
- You want to talk about it?
- There's nothing to talk about.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.958
Alright.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.350
So you're just gonna
pout all weekend?

11:39.437 --> 11:42.092
I'm not pouting.
I'm quietly reflecting.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.486
The time to be quiet
was about an hour ago.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.708
You guys heard us?

11:48.795 --> 11:50.187
Little bit, but between
the dogs barking

11:50.274 --> 11:51.711
and your neighbors yelling
"Shut the hell up"

11:51.798 --> 11:54.191
it was hard to make out
every stupid thing you said.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.237
Although "Don't clip
this eagle's wings"

11:56.324 --> 11:59.022
was particularly
cringe-worthy.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.850
Can we just
change the subject, please?

12:00.937 --> 12:02.460
- Sure.
- Absolutely.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.553
- Carl?
- Yeah?

12:08.640 --> 12:11.078
I'm not having fun yet.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.689
Just give it a chance,
before you know it

12:13.776 --> 12:15.691
there'll be more fun
than you can handle.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.649
That's what they said
in the gay tent.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.218
Can you at least explain
why this adventure

12:21.305 --> 12:23.046
has to take place
in the middle of the night?

12:23.133 --> 12:25.092
Oh, simple, you want to get
your hook in the water

12:25.179 --> 12:27.007
before the crack of dawn because
the fish are still sleepin'

12:27.094 --> 12:28.138
and they'll put anything
in their mouths.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.923
It's the same way with broads.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.405
How can fish sleep?
They have no eyelids.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.972
Well, you can sleep
with your eyes open.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.758
He's right.
My Uncle Pete slept that way.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.064
He was dead for two days
before we even knew it.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.806
We thought he was just enjoying
a Twilight Zone marathon.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.679
Uh, speaking of dead,
did anybody bring worms?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.464
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

12:49.551 --> 12:52.075
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid!

12:54.991 --> 12:56.863
I'm sure they sell worms
by the lake.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.823
Yeah, we should be fine.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.478
Nonsense. He called
planning our wedding nonsense.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.567
Sweetie, I-I don't think
those pancakes

13:05.654 --> 13:06.960
are part of your diet.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.309
Do you want to reach over here

13:08.396 --> 13:10.093
and try to take them
away from me?

13:15.403 --> 13:16.708
No, I do not.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.885
Smart.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.975
Besides, this is my new diet.

13:22.062 --> 13:23.715
This is the I'm mad
at my boyfriend

13:23.803 --> 13:25.630
and I'm punishing myself diet.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.502
Oh, that sounds
a lot like your old

13:27.589 --> 13:28.851
I just found out
my boyfriend's gay

13:28.938 --> 13:31.027
so I'm eating cake
and hot dogs diet.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.684
Same principle.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.034
Molly, you just got engaged.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.123
Why are you pushing so hard
on the wedding?

13:40.210 --> 13:42.517
I'm not pushing, I'm planning.
And you know why?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.693
- 'Cause you're a planner?
- Exactly.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.785
It's, it's part of
why I'm a good teacher.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.048
I mean, I walk in that room
full of little monsters

13:52.135 --> 13:54.094
and every day I have a plan.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.878
'Cause if I didn't,
we'd be eating boogers

13:55.965 --> 13:57.706
and making fun of me
all day long.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.797
- Do we have any hot dogs?
- No.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.495
No hot dogs and no pancakes.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.323
You're not eating
this stress away.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.325
We're going to my yoga class.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.327
Like hell I am.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.200
Me in a leotard surrounded
by skinny, bendy women?

14:13.287 --> 14:14.810
I'd rather kill us all.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.466
I'm scared.
Make her a hot dog, mom.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.516
Okay, fine, you can either
come with me and your sister

14:25.603 --> 14:27.518
or stay here and eat pancakes
until you're left

14:27.605 --> 14:29.912
with no self-esteem
and no elbows.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.221
- Well?
- I'm thinking about it!

14:34.308 --> 14:37.180
[instrumental music]

14:39.226 --> 14:41.402
Please tell me
why we are here.

14:41.489 --> 14:44.318
When did our people ever have
good experiences on boats?

14:46.320 --> 14:48.800
I'm not getting any kind of
cell phone reception at all.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.454
That's 'cause we're
in the middle of nowhere.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.327
There's nothing out here but
bait shops and the Ku Klux Klan.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.594
Just stay on the boat,
you'll be fine.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.774
Hey, I got reception. You
wanna call Molly on my phone?

15:05.861 --> 15:07.167
I'm not gonna call her,
but she might be

15:07.254 --> 15:09.038
trying to call me
to say she's sorry.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.912
Yeah, that sounds like Molly,
apologetic and contrite.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.218
Wait, I'm getting bars.
Five bars!

15:15.305 --> 15:18.221
No, three bars, two bars.
Are we drifting?

15:18.308 --> 15:19.831
- I just had five bars.
- Hey, wait, wait.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.834
[all yelling]

15:24.097 --> 15:25.011
Ah!

15:27.143 --> 15:29.406
Thank you very much.

15:29.493 --> 15:32.105
Did I mention I can't swim?

15:32.192 --> 15:34.498
Glad I called shotgun.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.680
Take three deep breaths.
Inhale through your nose.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.813
[inhales]

15:44.900 --> 15:45.945
Exhale through your mouth.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.034
[exhales]

15:48.121 --> 15:49.078
'Inhale..'

15:49.165 --> 15:51.602
[inhales]

15:51.689 --> 15:52.647
...and exhale.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.388
[exhales]

15:54.475 --> 15:56.651
This place smells like feet
and patchouli.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.178
Namaste.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.963
Alright, ladies, let's all get
back on our hand and knees

16:04.050 --> 16:07.792
and loosen up our spines by
alternating between cat and cow.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.098
What the hell
is he talking about?

16:09.185 --> 16:12.841
Just watch me
and do what I do.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.235
'Meow.'

16:17.324 --> 16:19.848
'Moo-o..'

16:19.935 --> 16:22.111
Sweetie, you don't have
to make animal sounds.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.244
It helps me remember
which is which.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.683
I don't think Mike
even wants to get married.

16:28.770 --> 16:29.945
Do you know
what he said this morning?

16:30.032 --> 16:30.990
Everybody in the neighborhood

16:31.077 --> 16:32.861
knows what he said this morning.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.645
Just focus on your breathing.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.518
I'd love to, except every time I
move, I'm re-chewin' a pancake.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.825
Let's work on
elongating your spine.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.305
In with the meow.

16:42.392 --> 16:43.915
Meow.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.397
Out with the moo.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.573
M-moo.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.665
My phone number is written
on my yoga mat.

16:56.624 --> 16:59.279
Alright, ladies, let's push
back into our downward dog.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.504
Oh!

17:09.506 --> 17:11.117
There's a lot of tension
in your hips.

17:11.204 --> 17:14.033
Easy does it. Last guy I let
back there had to buy me a ring.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.474
Ooh, this is one
for the bachelorette party.

17:25.522 --> 17:28.003
You owe me $600
for these alligator shoes.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.266
If they were really alligator,
they would've been waterproof.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.182
Well, look at me.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.314
I'm sitting around a fire

17:34.401 --> 17:36.751
half-naked with nothing to eat.

17:36.838 --> 17:39.319
Oh, how far I've come.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.365
It's not my fault
the sudden change

17:42.452 --> 17:44.063
in weight distribution
sunk the boat.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.325
So, you're saying
this is my fault?

17:45.412 --> 17:46.413
Yeah, that's what
we're all saying.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.458
Yeah, we all believe that.

17:48.545 --> 17:51.287
Look, I say we head home
before we become butt buddies

17:51.374 --> 17:54.595
to a pack of
toothless hillbillies.

17:54.682 --> 17:58.164
If that happens, I will
never travel with you again.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.470
Don't worry, they usually
go after the plump white ones.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.734
[cell phone chimes]

18:03.821 --> 18:06.128
Oh, Joyce texted me a picture.

18:06.215 --> 18:09.392
This always puts a pole
in the tent.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.873
Whoa.
Is this your fiance?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.878
She'd better be hiking
that guy a football.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.751
Uh-oh. I gotta go.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.278
We're leaving before
we are eaten by bears?

18:25.365 --> 18:28.716
Oh, I'm bitterly disappointed.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.674
Man, you're just
a little bitch, aren't you?

18:32.067 --> 18:34.113
[instrumental music]

18:35.244 --> 18:37.072
[door opens]

18:37.159 --> 18:39.683
Oh, hey sweetie.
Good, you're home.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.424
Of course I'm home.
Where else would I be?

18:41.511 --> 18:44.384
Nowhere.
I was just happy to see you.

18:44.471 --> 18:47.474
You're back kinda early.
Is everything okay?

18:47.561 --> 18:50.041
Well, there was a little
mishap with the vessel.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.829
Apparently, when you represent
one-third of the ship's ballast

18:54.916 --> 18:57.048
you should probably
keep your seat.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.270
You sunk a boat?

19:01.357 --> 19:03.881
[sighs]
Yeah, I sunk a boat.

19:06.971 --> 19:08.538
Sweetie, are you okay?

19:08.625 --> 19:10.236
I lost a good pair of briefs,
and you might have to

19:10.323 --> 19:12.194
check me later for leeches.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.022
Well, I always do.

19:15.502 --> 19:16.938
Oh, and, uh, on the way back

19:17.025 --> 19:19.984
we stopped at that reception
place near Lake Geneva.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.725
- Really?
- Yeah, and it was very nice.

19:21.812 --> 19:24.728
But I think we can do better
if we take time and look around.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.557
You know, together.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.690
You're willing
to make yourself available?

19:29.777 --> 19:32.345
Of course. It's important.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.608
It's our wedding.

19:34.695 --> 19:37.828
I'm surprised. You didn't seem
in any big hurry.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.613
You really don't get me, do you?

19:39.700 --> 19:41.354
No.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.965
You're not an easy read.

19:44.052 --> 19:47.360
But if you're willing to wash
the stink of lake water off ya

19:47.447 --> 19:49.449
yeah, you might get me.

19:49.536 --> 19:50.841
[laughing]

19:53.279 --> 19:55.846
- 'Hey, I'm in here!'
- I don't care!

20:03.245 --> 20:05.421
[instrumental music]

20:36.844 --> 20:39.063
[theme music]
