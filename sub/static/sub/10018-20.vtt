WEBVTT

00:06.917 --> 00:08.408
Previously on E.R.

00:08.409 --> 00:11.724
Your biopsy last time was positive
for cervical cancer.

00:11.725 --> 00:13.358
Twenty-five thousand in-

00:13.440 --> 00:15.644
Oh, it's a gift from the
old man. 10 to 1 it's dirty.

00:15.645 --> 00:19.112
- What are you doing here?
- I have no idea.

00:22.465 --> 00:25.598
- You're dumping me?
- And I feel good about it.

00:25.599 --> 00:30.168
Chloe is the mother and, as far as I can
see, she presents no danger to her child.

00:30.212 --> 00:32.991
Do you really think you can be
a good mother to this little girl?

00:32.992 --> 00:37.212
Yes. More than anything,
that's what I wanna be.

00:37.604 --> 00:38.649
"Fevers Of Uknown Origin"

00:38.684 --> 00:41.537
There's a blown water heater
at a residential location.

00:41.703 --> 00:44.525
Southeast corner of Gaze and Throup.

00:45.049 --> 00:48.219
Copy that.
Unit 47 will respond in about five.

00:48.803 --> 00:52.682
All right, everyone wears rubber boots.
Find Carol an extra pair.

00:52.849 --> 00:55.810
I thought the idea was that you guys
respond to emergencies...

00:55.977 --> 00:57.770
- ... not cause them.
- Hang on, hang on.

00:57.937 --> 01:01.857
We gotta pay you nurses back. When an
MICN rides along, we get double the calls.

01:02.023 --> 01:04.191
- Come on, Reilly, you're gonna jinx us.
- Shep!

01:06.612 --> 01:09.448
- This is unit 47 en route.
- Copy, 47.

01:15.246 --> 01:17.247
This is Ross.

01:17.916 --> 01:21.251
No, Doug Ross.
Ray's away on business.

01:23.754 --> 01:28.216
Let me give you somebody
who could answer that. Here.

01:28.550 --> 01:30.510
Hello?

01:31.136 --> 01:32.471
Hello?

01:32.639 --> 01:34.264
Anybody there?

01:35.890 --> 01:38.309
This is Karen Hines.

01:38.978 --> 01:41.146
Oh, hi, Andy.

01:42.021 --> 01:45.317
Yeah. How are the marlin running?

01:45.984 --> 01:47.236
No kidding.

01:47.403 --> 01:51.614
I thought you had fished
out every key south of Largo.

01:51.781 --> 01:54.827
So, Andy, Ray isn't there with you?

01:55.160 --> 02:00.415
Oh, well, I guess he must have
gotten distracted in the Caymans.

02:02.626 --> 02:04.418
That's nice.

02:05.169 --> 02:08.505
Yeah, just tell him that he's gotta call
Chicago when he gets in.

02:08.673 --> 02:11.968
Yeah. You know, we miss him up here.

02:19.517 --> 02:22.185
- You are a good liar.
- I wasn't lying.

02:22.353 --> 02:24.814
I wasn't. I do miss Ray.

02:24.980 --> 02:29.068
He's a kick. He's a dying breed.

02:33.697 --> 02:36.074
Oh, man, this is really perverse.

02:36.241 --> 02:38.660
Hey, it's not like your
dad and I are going steady,

02:38.661 --> 02:41.079
so let's minimize this oedipal stuff.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.632
You wanna call in sick?

02:51.798 --> 02:54.884
- Rent a Jackie Chan movie?
- No, it doesn't work that way.

02:55.051 --> 02:58.680
You could meet me for a late lunch
around 4:00, is what you could do.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.100
I hate hospitals.

03:03.643 --> 03:05.895
How do you feel about diners?

03:06.062 --> 03:09.732
There's one across the street.
You could meet me there.

03:09.899 --> 03:14.444
- A real diner?
- Meatloaf, ketchup on the table.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.989
You've seduced women before,
haven't you?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.578
She's down here somewhere!

03:22.745 --> 03:25.163
It just blew up!

03:25.539 --> 03:28.000
- Becky girl!
- Water heater was here?

03:28.167 --> 03:30.920
- Your daughter's bed was there?
- Oh, my God!

03:31.087 --> 03:33.130
Please, sir!
Please, you have to step away.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.590
You shouldn't be down here
with bare feet! Please!

03:35.758 --> 03:38.594
- That's still standing water!
- I told you we needed a new one!

03:38.761 --> 03:41.722
- We couldn't afford it.
- But we can afford bourbon every week!

03:42.098 --> 03:44.767
- Would you just shut up?
- Reilly, go get backup. I got it.

03:44.934 --> 03:49.270
- We're so weak. I told you!
- Why don't you shut up!

03:49.438 --> 03:51.690
Look, all right, listen, just take it easy!

03:51.857 --> 03:54.275
- What color pajamas is she wearing?
- Pink.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.486
Look for the color.
When was the explosion?

03:56.653 --> 03:59.949
- It was 10 minutes ago.
- Backup's on the way!

04:00.115 --> 04:02.116
- I found a foot!
- All right! Yeah, here!

04:02.283 --> 04:04.077
- All right, take it easy!
- There she is!

04:04.244 --> 04:06.580
- Oh, my God!
- Not too close, not too close! Easy!

04:06.747 --> 04:08.290
Find her head!

04:08.456 --> 04:12.460
Gently! All right, let's go! Gently,
all right? Let's roll her, get the board.

04:12.626 --> 04:14.212
Right.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.886
Oh, God!

04:21.761 --> 04:24.013
Weak pulse. Breath sounds?

04:24.180 --> 04:25.973
Oh, my God! She's not breathing!

04:26.140 --> 04:28.936
- Reilly, get an ET tube! You with us?
- Yeah! Yeah!

04:29.102 --> 04:30.811
Come on, come on! Come on!

04:30.978 --> 04:32.479
- Shoot!
- For crying out loud!

04:32.646 --> 04:34.357
- I got another one!
- Come on!

04:34.524 --> 04:37.360
Here, here! She's got it.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:46.952 --> 04:50.374
- Thank God!
- Good breath sounds bilaterally.

04:50.539 --> 04:53.667
Okay, darling, you're gonna be just fine.
Let's wrap her up.

04:53.833 --> 04:57.963
- Let's get her up. One, two, three.
- Easy, easy. Okay.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.882
We need the oxygen mask.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.258
Okay, sweetie, this is gonna
help you breathe.

05:02.425 --> 05:05.679
- Let's get out of here.
- Are you taking her to the hospital?

05:05.846 --> 05:07.806
- County.
- Is she gonna be okay?

05:07.972 --> 05:11.477
- We're gonna make sure at the hospital.
- I'm coming too.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.021
- I'll get dressed.
- Gotta find your own transport.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.355
The ambulance is full.

05:16.523 --> 05:18.859
- We can make room.
- Forget it.

05:19.026 --> 05:22.363
- I'm not letting these idiots into my rig.
- It's the girl's mother.

05:22.528 --> 05:25.031
Yeah, you heard her.
They knew the heater was a hazard.

05:25.198 --> 05:28.535
And they got a kid living near it,
they're too drunk to notice.

05:28.702 --> 05:33.081
- Okay.
- Stupid people shouldn't breed.

05:45.258 --> 05:46.761
- Morning.
- Oh, morning.

05:46.927 --> 05:48.221
How's it going?

05:48.388 --> 05:50.848
Going. Man, did you see all that traffic
this morning?

05:51.015 --> 05:54.643
I took the El today, as usual.
I didn't think you were working today.

05:54.809 --> 05:58.273
Oh, yeah. Well, I got called in.
It's just as well.

05:58.439 --> 06:00.774
- And last night? I was thinking about you.
- Thanks.

06:00.941 --> 06:04.195
I got your message. I'll fill you in later.

06:27.259 --> 06:28.802
Susan.

06:28.969 --> 06:32.097
Glad you could fill in
on such short notice.

06:32.264 --> 06:36.435
- No problem.
- You'll be able to go home by 4.

06:36.975 --> 06:39.605
I can do a full 12.

07:31.197 --> 07:34.825
- Okay, let's get a CBC, Chem-7, a-
- Heel-stick of glucose.

07:34.992 --> 07:36.367
- I said that already?
- Twice.

07:36.533 --> 07:38.870
- Lip lac in 3. Looks like stitches.
- I'll get it.

07:39.037 --> 07:40.663
- Sure you can handle another?
- Yep.

07:40.830 --> 07:44.626
- Mark, were you looking for me?
- Morgenstern wants to see us upstairs.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.461
- Did he say why?
- Something wrong?

07:46.628 --> 07:50.131
No, but it's May the 2nd,
so it could be the announcement.

07:50.299 --> 07:52.885
- Announcement?
- Resident of the Year.

07:53.052 --> 07:57.180
Not that I'm expecting it. Emergency
medicine always gets overlooked.

07:57.347 --> 08:01.185
Oh, yeah. Resident of the Year. Did
I remember to put your name in? I did.

08:01.351 --> 08:03.519
- Isn't the announcement in June?
- First of May.

08:03.686 --> 08:05.645
So do you think
you're gonna need me today?

08:05.812 --> 08:08.941
The reason I'm asking is,
if there's nothing on the schedule...

08:09.109 --> 08:12.445
...Simon got me in to assist on
a breast reconstruction at 10.

08:12.612 --> 08:14.864
Which is a procedure
that I haven't done yet.

08:15.031 --> 08:17.200
- Somebody page me?
- Dr. Ross, Trauma 1.

08:17.366 --> 08:20.619
- You're doing an OB rotation at Parkland?
- I fly to Dallas on Friday.

08:20.785 --> 08:22.872
- Talk to me before you leave, okay?
- I'm here.

08:23.706 --> 08:25.708
- Where's Ross?
- Meeting the paramedics.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.376
Got a little girl in bad shape.

08:27.541 --> 08:31.839
Dr. Benton, a lot of surgeons have said
that an elective in plastics can't hurt.

08:32.006 --> 08:34.383
Oh, plastics.
The beautiful people's specialty.

08:34.549 --> 08:36.510
- I thought I'd check it out.
- Well, go on.

08:36.676 --> 08:38.845
- You sure? Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:41.056 --> 08:43.433
- I got your page.
- Yep. On this lovely May morning...

08:43.600 --> 08:46.062
...we have a 6-year-old girl
exhumed from rubble.

08:46.227 --> 08:50.231
Respiratory arrest.
Resuscitated on the scene. BP, 90/60.

08:50.398 --> 08:52.860
- Thanks for calling me early.
- Just protecting myself.

08:53.027 --> 08:58.323
If we' re working together, I'll make sure
you're onboard from the very beginning.

08:58.490 --> 09:01.826
- He must have been wearing a big ring.
- This could take a few stitches.

09:01.993 --> 09:03.244
Will there be a scar?

09:03.411 --> 09:06.623
There could be at the vermilion border,
where the lip meets the skin.

09:06.789 --> 09:08.708
Do you want me to call a plastic surgeon?

09:08.876 --> 09:12.962
Not that I'll be staring in the mirror, but
my boyfriend says I have a pretty face.

09:13.129 --> 09:16.883
- You do.
- Somebody's mighty low to mug you.

09:17.050 --> 09:21.971
Honey, three times in two years.
They think the blind are an easy target.

09:22.138 --> 09:24.223
Well, I think you set this one straight.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.852
That self-defense course
was worth every penny.

09:28.019 --> 09:33.107
The cane worked like a charm.
Radared in on his balls.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.692
Bam! Bull's-eye!

09:34.942 --> 09:37.444
- He let go of your purse, did he?
- Wouldn't you?

09:40.740 --> 09:44.035
- What's that, Ms. Crandell?
- Tip of his pinkie.

09:44.493 --> 09:46.119
You bit his finger off?

09:46.287 --> 09:50.957
If the police don't need it for evidence,
I want it for a souvenir.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.964
- I want Mommy!
- She'll be here in a minute, sweetie.

09:57.131 --> 10:00.342
- C-spine is clear.
- Let's get that collar off. No pneumo.

10:00.509 --> 10:02.260
- All right.
- DPL's negative.

10:02.635 --> 10:07.140
Crit's normal. No internal bleeding.
Becky, you're one lucky little girl.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.393
- Good work in the field, 47.
- Lucky Carol was with us.

10:10.561 --> 10:13.480
It was very scary,
but you are a brave little girl.

10:13.646 --> 10:16.983
- Where's my mommy?
- She'll be here any minute.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.777
Wait, hold on.
She's got a bulge in the groin.

10:19.944 --> 10:21.195
- Where?
- There.

10:21.362 --> 10:23.072
Reducible hernia?

10:23.239 --> 10:26.618
Incarcerated. Probably caused by
increased intra-abdominal pressure.

10:26.784 --> 10:29.203
- From the trauma?
- Let's get her up to Surgery.

10:29.370 --> 10:34.500
Tell you what, you're gonna be fine.
Dr. Benton here is gonna fix you right up.

10:34.667 --> 10:38.337
As soon as your mommy and daddy get
here, I'm gonna bring them up to see you.

10:38.504 --> 10:41.424
Gosh, no. Sorry to disappoint.
Don't they announce that in June?

10:41.591 --> 10:43.843
First of May.
Doesn't matter, it was a long shot.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.930
I called you two up to start a conversation
on next year's Chief Resident.

10:48.096 --> 10:49.348
Good idea.

10:49.514 --> 10:53.101
- Hope you don't mind that Kerry's here?
- Not at all.

10:53.268 --> 10:56.522
She's one of the strongest chiefs
we've had in years.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.857
You did a fine job for us also, Mark.

10:59.024 --> 11:01.695
I thought Kerry and you
could make this a mutual decision.

11:02.194 --> 11:04.238
Susan Lewis
would be my first choice.

11:04.404 --> 11:08.200
Before we discuss candidates, we ought
to brainstorm about what qualities...

11:08.366 --> 11:10.702
- ... we'd see in an ideal chief.
- Makes sense.

11:10.869 --> 11:13.705
- Our chief needs to be focused in crisis.
- Exactly.

11:13.872 --> 11:16.792
A leader in the ER needs to cut
to the chase, assume the worst.

11:16.959 --> 11:20.253
Right, don't you think Susan Lewis
has that quality?

11:22.547 --> 11:24.949
I think Kerry's right. Let's
not try to solve this today,

11:24.984 --> 11:26.551
just start the ball rolling.

11:31.222 --> 11:34.475
- Carter, glad I caught you.
- Yes, I was just about to assist...

11:34.642 --> 11:38.439
- ... on my first breast reconstruction.
- I'm afraid you aren't.

11:38.897 --> 11:40.147
Why?

11:40.314 --> 11:43.443
Did you call the registrar
requesting a review of your transcript?

11:43.609 --> 11:45.529
To verify I'm graduating
with honors.

11:45.695 --> 11:48.740
They discovered that you're deficient
in ambulatory medicine.

11:48.906 --> 11:50.199
What?

11:50.366 --> 11:54.203
You can't graduate without seeing
the required number of Pedes patients.

11:54.370 --> 11:55.620
What?

11:55.787 --> 11:59.749
Luckily, Doug Ross is taking you on
for the next four weeks.

11:59.916 --> 12:01.879
I was hoping for an elective in plastics.

12:02.044 --> 12:05.881
If you start this morning, you have the
time to complete this remedial work...

12:06.047 --> 12:08.050
...and graduate
with the rest of your class.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.137
Dr. Ross is expecting you.

12:13.179 --> 12:15.309
Yeah, and I want that consult
down here stat.

12:15.474 --> 12:17.934
- Susan, did you just say "stat"?
- Yeah, and I mean it.

12:18.102 --> 12:20.603
Look who's here! Isn't she precious?

12:20.770 --> 12:23.941
Oh, she looks just like her mommy.

12:24.108 --> 12:28.153
- Will she let me hold her?
- I hope so, my arms are about to fall off.

12:28.319 --> 12:32.949
- Hello. Hello, baby.
- So tiny.

12:33.116 --> 12:35.618
- Hello.
- Nice outfit.

12:35.785 --> 12:39.456
- I think so.
- Hey, it's Randi-Wear, right?

12:50.799 --> 12:52.678
- Susan?
- What do you got?

12:52.845 --> 12:55.554
A woman passed out in the crosswalk.

12:55.721 --> 12:58.349
GCS, 10 in the field.
She's coming around.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.102
Okay, Trauma 1.

13:02.352 --> 13:04.981
Ma'am.
Ma'am, do you know where you are?

13:05.230 --> 13:08.484
All right, let's move her
on a count of three.

13:08.650 --> 13:12.821
One, two, three.

13:12.989 --> 13:17.159
- Get a glucose.
- She's hypertensive, 170/120.

13:17.325 --> 13:20.496
Titrate a Nipride drip
to a diastolic of 100.

13:20.663 --> 13:22.707
Do you have a history
of high blood pressure?

13:22.874 --> 13:26.167
- Oh, no. Not again.
- Okay, okay. Try and relax.

13:26.334 --> 13:28.004
Her name is Joanne Bairos.

13:28.171 --> 13:31.047
We'll try to lower your blood
pressure. Has it happened before?

13:31.214 --> 13:34.342
- I don't wanna lose this baby. Not again!
- You're pregnant?

13:34.508 --> 13:35.845
- Yes.
- How far along?

13:36.929 --> 13:39.180
Twenty. No, no. Twenty-one weeks.

13:39.347 --> 13:42.810
Okay, cancel the Nipride,
give her 10 of hydralazine. Call OB.

13:42.977 --> 13:45.729
- You lost an earlier baby?
- Last year.

13:45.895 --> 13:50.942
In the sixth month.
Oh, God, I can't live through this again.

13:51.110 --> 13:53.903
Okay. Hook her up to a fetal monitor
and an EKG.

13:54.070 --> 13:56.866
Did you have preeclampsia before?
Do you remember?

13:57.032 --> 13:59.075
They said it was high blood pressure.

13:59.243 --> 14:03.453
It made my placenta tear, and if they
didn't take the baby out, I'd die.

14:03.620 --> 14:06.624
- I see.
- My baby was too little.

14:06.791 --> 14:10.210
- She couldn't live.
- BP's rising, 180/130.

14:10.377 --> 14:13.172
Add propranolol.
Who's on call for OB?

14:13.339 --> 14:16.550
- Dr. Croix.
- But it's not the baby's fault!

14:16.717 --> 14:19.554
Your hypertension is probably related
to the pregnancy.

14:19.721 --> 14:23.391
No, no. But I've been dizzy sometimes
in between the pregnancies.

14:23.557 --> 14:25.142
- You have?
- Yes.

14:25.725 --> 14:29.480
- What's the fetal heart rate?
-145. Good variability.

14:30.063 --> 14:31.356
Don't let them take her.

14:32.357 --> 14:36.237
- Susan, shouldn't we be moving her up?
- No, I'm gonna do an ultrasound first.

14:36.404 --> 14:38.947
Her BP's 190/140.

14:39.114 --> 14:42.159
The fetus isn't in distress.
I want an ultrasound first.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.578
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save your baby.

14:50.876 --> 14:52.627
I don't know, I'll check it out.

14:52.794 --> 14:55.714
- Yeah, I heard you. I'll check it out.
- Told you they were mad.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.466
Haleh, is that ultrasound
for the hypertensive patient...

14:58.633 --> 15:01.386
- ... OB's been screaming at me about?
- Who ordered that?

15:01.553 --> 15:03.514
I'll take care of it.

15:11.604 --> 15:15.274
- Bring me up to speed.
- Hypertensive woman in her 21 st week.

15:15.441 --> 15:19.363
Fetal heart tones normal. She responded
to hydralazine and propranolol.

15:19.529 --> 15:21.698
- What's the BP?
-130/100.

15:21.863 --> 15:24.743
- She's stable for transfer.
- Any contractions?

15:24.909 --> 15:28.454
- Some cramping, nothing on the monitor.
- It's preeclampsia. Get her up to OB.

15:28.621 --> 15:30.081
It's Susan's patient, Kerry.

15:30.247 --> 15:33.418
Patient lost a 22-week fetus
last year to preeclampsia.

15:33.584 --> 15:34.836
For goodness' sake.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.338
Complains of dizzy spells and possible
hypertension between pregnancies.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.508
Any protein in the urine?

15:40.675 --> 15:43.302
- Susan, if we've learned anything-
- Yes, yes. There!

15:43.469 --> 15:47.390
Right there! Mass in the adrenal gland.
Call the O.R. to schedule a room.

15:47.557 --> 15:49.433
You're right.
Looks like Conn syndrome.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.519
- What does that mean?
- You have a tumor in your adrenal gland...

15:52.685 --> 15:56.941
...producing a hormone which is making
your blood pressure rise. It's very serious.

15:57.108 --> 15:59.276
You'll probably need surgery
to remove the mass.

15:59.441 --> 16:01.362
- But the baby?
- Should be okay.

16:01.529 --> 16:05.365
- Cancel OB, we're going to Surgery.
- Good call, we would've missed that.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.828
- They could've done the ultrasound in OB.
- They aborted her last time.

16:08.995 --> 16:10.663
Let Surgery know we're on the way.

16:11.329 --> 16:14.624
Well, I think we've earned ourselves
a doughnut. Anyone want a Dinkles?

16:14.791 --> 16:16.835
- They've got some inside.
- Help yourself.

16:18.461 --> 16:21.672
- Could you bring me back one?
- Yeah, you bet.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.050
He's trying.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.387
Now I'm supposed to eat doughnuts
with the guy?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.638
It's not his fault Raul died, Shep.

16:29.805 --> 16:31.975
- It's not your fault either.
- I know.

16:32.141 --> 16:33.726
I know whose fault it is.

16:33.893 --> 16:38.189
It's the fine, upstanding, drugged-out,
meth-burning citizens we're here to serve.

16:39.190 --> 16:41.401
That's who Raul died for.

16:46.864 --> 16:49.826
- You're kidding.
- That's what I heard. Resident of the Year.

16:49.992 --> 16:51.828
I guess it isn't a personality contest.

16:51.994 --> 16:54.539
- Do we have to go to the party?
- There's gonna be cake.

16:54.705 --> 16:56.874
- Anyone seen Dr. Ross?
- Check the lounge.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.628
Ted, you're an attorney.
Never say, "Trust me. "

17:01.045 --> 17:04.756
The divorce wasn't slow and complicated
enough with two parties and two lawyers.

17:04.923 --> 17:08.134
- Now we have to get a mediator involved.
- I don't believe in divorce.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.720
I always suspected
you were an old-fashioned girl.

17:10.887 --> 17:12.430
Don't believe in marriage either.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.474
Dr. Benton, your highness,
Dr. Bradley was looking for you.

17:15.642 --> 17:16.893
- When?
- Just now.

17:17.060 --> 17:20.604
He said it was regarding your letter
to the Ethics Committee.

17:20.771 --> 17:22.816
Thanks.

17:25.402 --> 17:29.906
I'm gonna need some help! Loretta?
Loretta, I got you. I got you.

17:30.073 --> 17:31.741
Clear Curtain Area 2.

17:31.908 --> 17:33.743
I got you.

17:36.204 --> 17:40.124
So I don't pretend to be happy about the
situation, but I'll do my best for you.

17:43.419 --> 17:46.714
- And I'm available at any hour.
- She's not falling for the amnesia guy.

17:46.881 --> 17:49.008
- Is she?
- No, she's faking.

17:49.175 --> 17:52.637
Ever since she got possessed,
it's completed changed her personality.

17:52.803 --> 17:55.431
So do you need me
for anything right now?

17:55.597 --> 17:57.684
Well, we'll see what comes in.

17:57.850 --> 18:01.062
You're a fourth year, so you're not
gonna need a lot of handholding.

18:01.229 --> 18:05.441
You'll get me out on time, which works
for me. Just show up and you'll get an A.

18:06.066 --> 18:09.444
Something tells me that
it will change our lives forever.

18:10.530 --> 18:14.783
- What ever happened to his brain tumor?
- Cured when he was struck by lightning.

18:14.951 --> 18:16.451
It was not.

18:17.286 --> 18:19.287
Watch out, he's gonna drug her.

18:23.834 --> 18:27.462
- Ready?
- I promise you...

18:28.046 --> 18:30.632
...you will not be disappointed.

18:30.924 --> 18:33.677
- BP's 70/50.
- Okay, let's get that EKG.

18:33.843 --> 18:36.931
- Does your father have heart problems?
- Not before a few weeks ago.

18:37.097 --> 18:39.766
He was having trouble breathing,
so he went to the clinic.

18:39.933 --> 18:42.727
They said my heart
wasn't pumping hard enough.

18:42.894 --> 18:45.313
- Did they give you any medications?
- Yeah, they did.

18:45.814 --> 18:47.357
Here they are.

18:48.734 --> 18:50.819
Danny, honey, no! I'm so sorry.

18:50.985 --> 18:52.904
- I'm really sorry.
- What have we got?

18:53.071 --> 18:55.991
Mr. Dellanova's complaining
of nausea and blurred vision.

18:56.157 --> 18:58.159
Why don't you show them
to the waiting room.

18:58.325 --> 19:01.246
- When did he get this medicine?
- On the 18th.

19:02.997 --> 19:04.249
How's that EKG, Kerry?

19:04.415 --> 19:07.250
- Sinus Brady with 2nd degree AV block?
- How'd you guess?

19:07.418 --> 19:09.670
Took too many tablets.
You should have a lot left.

19:09.836 --> 19:11.588
- Malik, get a dig level.
- What is it?

19:11.756 --> 19:13.632
Your father overdosed on digoxin.

19:14.133 --> 19:16.678
- Is that serious?
- It can be, but we caught it in time.

19:16.844 --> 19:19.055
Stand by with Digibind.
Or do you want a lavage?

19:19.222 --> 19:20.972
It's all yours.

19:22.392 --> 19:24.851
Dr. Bradley, you were looking for me.
Dr. Benton.

19:25.020 --> 19:28.855
Yes. I'm sorry it took so long
to respond to your letter.

19:29.022 --> 19:31.274
Well, I know you're a busy man.

19:31.441 --> 19:34.152
I gather you are too.
Your letter was dated April 23rd...

19:34.320 --> 19:37.781
...but you left Dr. Vucelich's study
in early February?

19:37.948 --> 19:39.992
- That's true.
- So it took three months...

19:40.159 --> 19:42.327
...to report on what you
yourself called:

19:42.494 --> 19:45.580
"An alarming disregard
for research study protocol"?

19:45.747 --> 19:49.209
Well, I was hesitant to make accusations
against Dr. Vucelich.

19:49.376 --> 19:51.044
I mean, a man of his stature-

19:51.211 --> 19:53.713
I believe that caution is warranted.

19:54.298 --> 19:56.549
Let me return your letter to you now.

19:57.716 --> 20:00.053
- These claims are accurate.
- Oh, I have no doubt.

20:00.303 --> 20:04.056
Since they are reported
in the addendum to Vucelich's study.

20:06.559 --> 20:07.852
He's owning up to it?

20:08.018 --> 20:11.481
Apparently it was always intended
to be part of the published article.

20:11.772 --> 20:15.525
When did Dr. Vucelich add the addendum?
Before or after I sent the letter?

20:15.693 --> 20:18.111
I wouldn't be able to answer that.

20:32.626 --> 20:35.962
- Feeling better?
- Some. What happened?

20:36.129 --> 20:40.759
- You were dehydrated.
- I couldn't keep anything down.

20:40.926 --> 20:44.763
- Did your oncologist prescribe Compazine?
- No.

20:44.930 --> 20:49.559
- Did you tell him about your symptoms?
- I tried, but he's pretty busy.

20:49.726 --> 20:53.272
I called about the burns,
and he never got back to me.

20:53.439 --> 20:56.566
- Radiation burns.
- I thought it was supposed to happen...

20:56.733 --> 21:00.613
...but another woman in the waiting room
says I shouldn't be getting burned.

21:00.780 --> 21:04.699
- What's your oncologist's name again?
- Dr. Lyle Howard.

21:04.866 --> 21:08.829
Look, my kids are at a neighbor's.

21:08.995 --> 21:11.955
- Can they spend the night?
- Yeah.

21:12.791 --> 21:15.795
You're being admitted. I'll stop back.

21:17.878 --> 21:20.006
Mark, Susan just had
an interesting case...

21:20.173 --> 21:22.842
...but I can't convince her
to present it to the students.

21:23.009 --> 21:25.512
- There's not much to present.
- Sure there is.

21:25.677 --> 21:28.139
Have you all met my new student,
John Carter?

21:28.306 --> 21:30.808
- You're doing a Pedes rotation?
- Never too late.

21:30.975 --> 21:34.978
- You're mighty chipper today.
- Yes, I am, thank you.

21:35.145 --> 21:39.984
So I was trying to explain that Susan
needs to think like a teacher.

21:40.150 --> 21:42.653
Explain how she arrived at her diagnosis.

21:43.278 --> 21:47.325
I don't know. It just occurred to me he
took too many pills. It's freezing in here.

21:47.491 --> 21:50.577
I'm trying to impress on Susan
the importance of recognizing...

21:50.744 --> 21:53.164
...a good opportunity
to augment her teaching files.

21:53.331 --> 21:56.666
- How did the patient present?
- Elderly man, late 70s.

21:56.833 --> 21:59.670
Disoriented,
short of breath, blurred vision...

22:03.215 --> 22:06.344
Goddamn it. Where are you?

22:12.349 --> 22:14.769
Susan? Susan, what do you think?

22:19.647 --> 22:23.110
I've got patients waiting.
I gotta get back to work.

22:27.530 --> 22:30.492
Okay, buddy.
You're not feeling so great, huh?

22:30.825 --> 22:32.701
- What's his temperature?
-103.

22:32.868 --> 22:36.706
Okay, Carter, this is a good place for you
to start. Come and present your findings.

22:36.873 --> 22:38.374
No problem.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.709
I'm gonna listen to your chest.

22:41.043 --> 22:43.504
Okay, take a deep breath for me.

22:44.924 --> 22:47.007
Dr. Ross,
someone named Karen called for you.

22:47.174 --> 22:49.176
- Any message?
- Confirming lunch.

22:49.344 --> 22:51.346
So Karen's her name, huh?
Where'd you meet?

22:51.512 --> 22:53.180
We have a mutual acquaintance.

22:54.681 --> 22:57.727
Did you ever get ahold
of that oncologist, Howard?

22:57.894 --> 23:00.104
His secretary said
he'd be tied up all afternoon.

23:00.271 --> 23:01.897
Where is he?

23:02.731 --> 23:04.609
Upstairs.

23:05.234 --> 23:06.819
Number 701.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.694
Mark?

23:09.237 --> 23:11.240
Do you have a second?

23:11.949 --> 23:14.577
This is Jennifer, my...

23:14.952 --> 23:17.871
- Soon-to-be ex-wife.
- Hi. Randi.

23:18.037 --> 23:21.374
You have a great soon-to-be ex-husband.

23:21.542 --> 23:23.293
Excuse me.

23:25.629 --> 23:27.673
Where is Jerry?

23:28.799 --> 23:30.842
Oh, he's off today.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.429
- Something wrong?
- No, I was just in town to see my lawyer.

23:34.597 --> 23:39.058
You know, I don't know. About an hour
into the meeting I realized I'd spent $250.

23:39.517 --> 23:41.478
It just seems so ridiculous.

23:43.188 --> 23:45.647
We've been making decisions
together for 15 years.

23:45.814 --> 23:50.570
I just thought we could get together
and cut to the chase.

23:52.654 --> 23:54.740
My shift ends at 8.

23:55.158 --> 23:57.243
Great. I'll swing by then.

24:01.246 --> 24:03.499
1033.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.620
OUT OF ORDER

24:08.790 --> 24:13.009
- Great. Now what?
- Has anyone called for paramedics? Hello?

24:19.765 --> 24:21.850
My brother is shot.

24:23.226 --> 24:24.812
This way.

24:25.813 --> 24:27.689
Stay close.

24:30.441 --> 24:32.320
Whore!

24:33.905 --> 24:37.031
One more word and your pal
can bleed to death right where he is.

24:37.197 --> 24:39.285
We're sorry. Please!

24:40.703 --> 24:43.371
She's a nurse and she works every day
saving your asses!

24:43.538 --> 24:47.251
- I'm okay, Shep.
- I wish you would've stayed in the rig.

24:53.591 --> 24:55.717
I've spotted our customer.

24:57.802 --> 24:59.887
Stand back, stand back!

25:01.598 --> 25:04.309
He's barely breathing.
Time to practice again, Reilly!

25:04.476 --> 25:06.393
- Got it!
- Weak pulse.

25:06.560 --> 25:10.230
I'm gonna start an IV.
My God, how many times was he shot?

25:10.398 --> 25:13.400
- Is he dying? Don't let him die.
- Step back! Just let me work!

25:13.567 --> 25:16.404
- Reilly, go get the board. We need it.
- Got it.

25:17.822 --> 25:20.033
All right. IV's in, wide open.
You okay?

25:20.700 --> 25:23.578
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Back off!

25:29.081 --> 25:31.043
Take a deep breath. You're doing fine.

25:31.294 --> 25:33.587
- Help him, man! Come on!
- You've got to step back!

25:33.755 --> 25:36.673
Help him! Come on, man, help him!

25:38.216 --> 25:40.094
Stay off!

25:42.430 --> 25:44.807
Hey, take it easy, man! Easy!

25:46.601 --> 25:49.269
- Hey, what happened?
- He wouldn't back off.

25:50.396 --> 25:53.524
- He's out cold.
- Good. Maybe now I can work.

25:54.942 --> 25:57.027
So that's your diagnosis.
The kid has the flu?

25:57.193 --> 26:00.697
Viral syndrome. I prescribed
fever-control measures and fluids.

26:00.864 --> 26:04.284
A rash, conjunctivitis, swollen glands.
How long has he had the fever?

26:04.451 --> 26:06.201
His mom said about a week.

26:06.369 --> 26:09.789
- Fever of unknown origin for seven days.
- Did I miss something?

26:09.956 --> 26:11.249
What color's his tongue?

26:11.416 --> 26:13.166
- Pink.
- Not strawberry?

26:13.333 --> 26:14.627
Maybe. I'm not sure.

26:14.794 --> 26:16.588
- Did you notice his chapped lips?
- Yeah.

26:16.754 --> 26:18.965
Give him an aspirin
and order an echocardiogram.

26:19.131 --> 26:23.553
- But you never give aspirin to a child.
- Unless he's diagnosed with Kawasaki's.

26:24.304 --> 26:26.471
Kawasaki's...

26:27.264 --> 26:30.351
Kawasaki's is a cluster
of unremarkable symptoms...

26:30.518 --> 26:32.978
...that can lead to coronary aneurysm.

26:33.146 --> 26:37.316
Fever, chapped lips
and strawberry tongue are the tip-offs.

26:37.483 --> 26:39.819
- Admit the boy to the Pedes unit.
- Right away.

26:42.946 --> 26:45.657
Susan? I thought you went home at 4.

26:45.824 --> 26:48.660
- What, and miss the big party?
- Yeah, I just heard.

26:48.827 --> 26:50.996
Certainly my choice
for Resident of the Year.

26:51.163 --> 26:55.877
- So you're not avoiding going home?
- Well, there's that too.

26:56.042 --> 26:59.921
Look, do you want to get a bite
to eat later on or something?

27:00.088 --> 27:02.173
Damn, I just made plans.

27:02.340 --> 27:04.759
- I can cancel.
- No, I'm fine.

27:05.093 --> 27:08.013
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure, we'll see.

27:10.432 --> 27:12.559
Mr. Dellanova, you're doing much better.

27:12.726 --> 27:15.186
We're gonna admit you
to CICU for follow-up.

27:15.353 --> 27:17.939
Okay, I need your John Hancock
on this.

27:18.106 --> 27:22.152
- All these lines.
- Just the one marked "Patient. "

27:26.781 --> 27:29.575
Your father said the overdose
was an accident?

27:29.742 --> 27:34.205
- Oh, yes.
- The dosage was right there on the bottle.

27:34.955 --> 27:38.168
My mom died a few months ago.
He misses her.

27:38.876 --> 27:43.630
I've had to take over doing his bills, but
that's just because he hates paperwork.

27:43.798 --> 27:46.718
He always has.
He's not the suicidal type.

27:46.883 --> 27:48.721
And does he need glasses for reading?

27:48.887 --> 27:51.221
- He's more of a TV-watcher.
- If you come with me...

27:51.388 --> 27:53.474
- ... we'll get him admitted.
- Okay.

27:54.475 --> 27:56.727
- Pop, I'll be right back, okay?
- Bye, sweetheart.

27:56.893 --> 27:58.438
All right.

27:58.603 --> 28:01.648
Mr. Dellanova, do you know my name?

28:02.733 --> 28:05.944
I know I owe my life to you.

28:06.111 --> 28:08.780
No, my name. I'm wearing it.

28:09.865 --> 28:11.117
Can you read this?

28:14.578 --> 28:19.082
Doctor something.
I can't make out the second part.

28:20.083 --> 28:22.252
I'm Dr. Lewis.

28:23.920 --> 28:27.257
And you need to tell your daughter
that you can't read.

28:27.632 --> 28:30.176
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

28:31.428 --> 28:34.597
I thought the clinic said something
about twice a day.

28:36.016 --> 28:39.979
I thought maybe it was two
pills each time.

28:40.146 --> 28:42.813
Medications can be tricky
for a lot of reasons.

28:45.275 --> 28:49.194
I never wanted my kids to know.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.738
I wanted them...

28:52.573 --> 28:54.868
...to do school right.

28:55.035 --> 28:58.161
And you raised a good daughter.
And now you should let her help you.

29:00.582 --> 29:05.168
You want your kids
not to be ashamed of you.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.507
You have children, right?

29:27.983 --> 29:31.445
No. No, I don't.

29:33.154 --> 29:35.239
Excuse me, it's been a bad day.

29:36.992 --> 29:39.411
- Stack it in the lounge, the cake too.
- What's this?

29:39.578 --> 29:42.246
Sparkling cider.
For some announcement thing.

29:42.413 --> 29:45.251
- Dr. Greene told me to put it there.
- Don't tell him I saw it.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.335
All right, Carter,
I'm going across the street for lunch.

29:48.502 --> 29:51.464
And I'm late,
so you page me if you need me.

29:51.631 --> 29:53.717
And if you're wondering,
you do still need me.

29:53.883 --> 29:55.176
I know. I will.

29:56.844 --> 30:00.349
Got a twofer. Adolescent male sprang
a few leaks when one of his homeboys...

30:00.516 --> 30:03.350
...disapproved of his method
of tying twisties on the baggies.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.188
- Gurney two fell down, went boom.
- All right, I'm with Shep.

30:07.355 --> 30:10.232
Carter, you take 2.
Haleh, you get Benton for me, please.

30:10.399 --> 30:13.443
- Join you in a minute, Mr. Carter.
- Okay.

30:14.988 --> 30:19.241
All right. Start pumping the fluids.
Four units O-negative on the rapid infuser.

30:19.408 --> 30:21.535
- BP's 40 palp.
- The kid's Swiss cheese.

30:21.703 --> 30:24.328
- He's draining like a sieve.
- I'll start a central line.

30:24.496 --> 30:27.707
Get a CBC, Chem-20 and chest films.
How old do you think this kid is?

30:27.874 --> 30:30.545
My guess is 14.
But look at the scars. He's been around.

30:31.753 --> 30:33.629
- V-fib!
- All right, let's shock him.

30:33.797 --> 30:35.047
No, hang on. Move that.

30:36.551 --> 30:38.469
- Excuse me.
- Just a second.

30:38.636 --> 30:41.096
- Ross called me?
- Trauma 1.

30:45.393 --> 30:50.104
- Not responding. Thoracotomy tray.
- Finally, Peter. I'll check on Mr. Carter.

30:50.312 --> 30:53.483
-10-blade.
- Is that an entrance or exit wound?

30:53.650 --> 30:56.528
- At this point, who can tell?
- Okay. You want me to crack him?

30:56.694 --> 30:58.948
- Nope, I got it.
- There you go.

30:59.656 --> 31:02.075
- Rib spreader.
- I'll break it for you.

31:02.241 --> 31:04.243
Thanks.

31:04.410 --> 31:06.579
What a mess.
Bullet must have nicked the aorta.

31:06.746 --> 31:09.498
I need some suction here, please.

31:10.374 --> 31:12.752
- Aorta's cross-clamped.
- He's in fib!

31:13.670 --> 31:16.880
Internal paddles!
Squeeze another three units, please.

31:17.923 --> 31:19.591
Hang on.

31:19.758 --> 31:21.302
Give me 20.

31:21.469 --> 31:24.555
Charging. Clear!

31:25.514 --> 31:28.393
Again. 30, charging. Clear!

31:28.559 --> 31:30.270
We've got a rhythm. Let's go!

31:32.562 --> 31:35.566
Shooting! Clear.

31:36.984 --> 31:40.028
Okay, did you get an AP,
a lateral and an open-mouth?

31:40.612 --> 31:43.241
Once he clears the C-spine,
let's send him for a Panorex.

31:43.408 --> 31:46.993
- No signs of respiratory distress.
- One million units Pen G.

31:47.828 --> 31:49.956
I feel a deformity.
What did he hit his jaw on?

31:50.123 --> 31:51.999
A stone coffee table with a sharp edge.

31:52.166 --> 31:53.979
Yeah, he fell right
over backwards onto it.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.793
He really didn't fall, did he?

31:55.961 --> 31:56.946
He was pushed.

31:57.042 --> 31:59.005
I shoved him. I was
trying to tube his pal.

31:59.172 --> 32:01.883
- You threw him across the room.
- I wish I had thrown him.

32:02.050 --> 32:05.638
However he fell, he needs a head CT.
Let's call Maxillofacial, wire the jaw.

32:05.805 --> 32:08.014
Well done, Mr. Carter.

32:14.104 --> 32:15.979
Are you looking for someone?

32:16.230 --> 32:18.023
- Coming through!
- Sorry.

32:19.818 --> 32:23.821
Hey! Hi. Sorry I'm late, I got held up.

32:23.987 --> 32:26.574
- I think I'll wait outside.
- I'll be there in a minute.

32:26.741 --> 32:29.285
- Oh, take your time.
- Yeah.

32:29.828 --> 32:31.119
- Hey, Reilly?
- What?

32:31.286 --> 32:34.249
- Don't ever pull that crap again.
- What are you talking about?

32:34.415 --> 32:36.459
You know what I mean!

32:51.724 --> 32:54.016
Too late for a lunch?

32:55.936 --> 32:58.022
I kind of lost my appetite.

32:58.188 --> 33:02.401
I guess you didn't see anything in there
that changed your opinion about hospitals.

33:02.567 --> 33:03.860
Or doctors.

33:06.863 --> 33:11.284
Hey, Doug, you haven't by any chance
heard from your dad today, have you?

33:11.451 --> 33:13.203
No, I haven't. Why?

33:13.370 --> 33:17.791
- I can't reach him in the Caymans.
- He'll turn up. He always does.

33:17.958 --> 33:20.670
Although sometimes it takes years.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.128
You think that's funny?

33:23.545 --> 33:26.549
Yeah, he's got some of my
hard-earned money with him.

33:26.716 --> 33:28.718
A lot of money?

33:30.010 --> 33:31.971
Enough.

33:34.641 --> 33:36.434
Hey.

33:38.018 --> 33:40.438
There's only one thing
to do after a day like today.

33:40.605 --> 33:43.775
- What's that?
- What time do you get off?

33:53.618 --> 33:55.911
Boy, did I pick the wrong specialty.

33:56.079 --> 33:57.746
- What's that?
- Emergency medicine.

33:57.913 --> 34:02.418
Damn radiation oncologists work a few
hours, and then lock the doors at 10 to 5.

34:02.585 --> 34:05.755
Those radiation oncologists
sound pretty smart.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.090
You're Dr. Howard, aren't you?

34:08.255 --> 34:09.509
You're Mark Greene?

34:09.675 --> 34:12.512
Saw your name on the call sheet.
Didn't have time to get back.

34:12.678 --> 34:16.556
I was calling about a patient of yours.
Loretta Sweet.

34:17.224 --> 34:20.185
She's down in the ER.
She's hypovolemic with cystitis.

34:20.351 --> 34:24.190
Yeah, that happens. The ER
sounds like the right place for her.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.315
She seemed unprepared
for the side effects.

34:26.483 --> 34:28.817
If she complains again,
I'll prescribe Compazine.

34:28.984 --> 34:33.782
She tried to bring up a few things. I think
she feels overwhelmed and confused.

34:33.949 --> 34:35.449
Don't they all?

34:35.617 --> 34:39.329
Maybe that should tell you something
about how well you inform your patients.

34:39.496 --> 34:44.625
- I give my patients plenty of information.
- She also has radiation burns.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.337
- This a relative of yours?
- Friend of the family.

34:47.504 --> 34:51.547
Catch me during office hours,
I'll review her chart.

34:53.635 --> 34:55.469
- Trauma 2! You get the page?
- What page?

34:55.637 --> 34:58.471
- Hicks is frantic. Multiple trauma in 2!
- I didn't get a page!

34:58.639 --> 35:00.725
She paged you half an hour ago.

35:01.892 --> 35:03.602
Surprise!

35:14.447 --> 35:17.033
- Resident of the Year!
- Congratulations.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.576
Congratulations, Peter.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.037
All right, Dr. Benton!

35:22.496 --> 35:26.792
No, it's a prestige thing.
They'll never give it to an ER Resident.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.378
Susan, there's a patient here
that you're going to want to see.

35:30.545 --> 35:34.299
- You're off. You want me to get it?
- No, I'm fine.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.469
I won't deny it.
When Susan's on her game, she's good.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.764
- I agree. Focused and decisive.
- She was today.

35:40.931 --> 35:42.724
I wish she was like that all the time.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.936
She's not very adept at keeping
her personal problems out of work.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.687
Good night, all. See you.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.607
Peter?
Congratulations, you deserved it.

35:50.774 --> 35:54.402
I hate to run, but I got an appointment.
Good work, Peter. I'm proud of you.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.113
So give my best to Karen.

35:57.614 --> 36:01.617
So, Peter, I have an intussusception
in half an hour. Care to join me?

36:03.410 --> 36:05.370
Sure.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.998
I think I'll cash in on my 15 minutes'
worth of fame.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.667
You worked hard enough for it.

36:11.085 --> 36:12.462
So did you nominate me?

36:13.921 --> 36:17.175
No, I believe that was Carl Vucelich.

36:19.718 --> 36:22.095
So in case you thought
I hadn't noticed, I had.

36:24.556 --> 36:27.601
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Good. You should.

36:39.029 --> 36:42.741
- What is it?
- Oh, man, I'm so pissed.

36:42.908 --> 36:46.244
- What?
- That Reilly.

36:47.119 --> 36:50.624
Punk! He put in
a freaking incident report against me!

36:50.791 --> 36:53.083
- What?
- Yeah. He said I used excessive force...

36:53.250 --> 36:55.837
...with that guy,
that banger with the busted jaw.

36:56.588 --> 36:58.715
He made it sound
like I went off or something.

36:58.882 --> 37:01.927
- The guy's supposed to be my partner.
- Why would he say that?

37:02.093 --> 37:03.429
He's green.

37:03.595 --> 37:07.973
He was amped, we were all amped.
You saw it, I barely shoved that guy.

37:10.685 --> 37:13.437
Come on, it's been a long day.

37:13.605 --> 37:17.609
So we'll say every Wednesday,
every other weekend...

37:17.777 --> 37:20.361
...and we'll rotate summers and holidays.

37:20.528 --> 37:21.779
That should work.

37:22.946 --> 37:26.950
It will include the stipulation that we have
to stay in the Chicago, Milwaukee area...

37:27.201 --> 37:29.662
...until Rachel graduates
from high school.

37:29.870 --> 37:32.416
- Can you even imagine?
- No.

37:33.582 --> 37:34.833
That was easy.

37:36.043 --> 37:38.337
So should we split up the stock portfolios?

37:39.129 --> 37:41.256
Sure.

37:42.424 --> 37:44.051
I'll split a piece of pie with you.

37:45.385 --> 37:47.138
You're on.

37:47.305 --> 37:49.848
- Slice of rhubarb.
- All right.

37:50.015 --> 37:52.433
- Two forks.
- Coming up.

37:58.648 --> 38:01.611
- Why don't you wait over there?
- Okay.

38:02.985 --> 38:06.322
So, Mr. Johnson,
I hear you had a little accident.

38:06.489 --> 38:09.202
Yeah, I cut my finger.
I was making a sandwich.

38:09.368 --> 38:12.286
- The kitchen can be a dangerous place.
- It won't stop bleeding.

38:12.453 --> 38:15.414
Cut the tip of your pinkie off.
We'll need to irrigate that.

38:15.582 --> 38:18.834
- Are you right-handed, Mr. Johnson?
- Yeah.

38:19.168 --> 38:22.672
Then how did you manage to cut
the tip of your right pinkie off?

38:22.838 --> 38:26.967
- Yeah, wouldn't you cut your left hand?
- I don't know.

38:27.134 --> 38:29.928
And what about your other injury?

38:32.348 --> 38:34.475
Fell back on my chair
and landed on the leg.

38:34.641 --> 38:38.021
All right, you wanna lie back
so I can look at that?

38:44.067 --> 38:46.362
Oh, yeah, that's one mean
testicular contusion.

38:46.529 --> 38:49.323
We'll do an ultrasound of his pelvis.
Immobilize his leg.

38:49.489 --> 38:52.785
You're gonna need to lie
very still.

38:52.952 --> 38:56.370
So did you bring the tip of your finger in?
We can graft it back on.

38:57.331 --> 39:01.335
- No, I couldn't find it.
- Lost in the kitchen, huh?

39:01.502 --> 39:05.713
Well, it doesn't matter.
We can probably make this one fit.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.050
Hey! Let me up! Let me up!

39:10.761 --> 39:14.180
- That was fun.
- Made my day.

39:26.401 --> 39:28.904
I can't believe we just did that.

39:29.863 --> 39:31.698
Me neither.

39:32.281 --> 39:36.202
Oh, God! What am I going to tell Craig?

39:38.538 --> 39:40.998
You've handled that one before.

39:45.628 --> 39:48.297
Is that what this was? Revenge?

39:49.089 --> 39:51.009
A parting shot?

39:51.843 --> 39:54.511
No, no, no.

39:57.014 --> 39:59.601
It was just a bad idea.

40:01.768 --> 40:04.104
Yes, it was.

40:16.867 --> 40:18.326
This okay? Right here, okay?

40:18.493 --> 40:21.622
Well, I don't think we should sit
until we dance.

40:21.789 --> 40:24.331
No, no, no.

40:24.498 --> 40:27.169
- Getting shy on me?
- Shy? What, are you kidding me?

40:27.336 --> 40:30.548
I was gonna complain
because it's not big enough out here.

40:30.715 --> 40:34.467
Not big enough for you?
Well, well.

40:56.030 --> 40:59.409
Oh, God! That was a good one.

41:04.706 --> 41:06.999
Well, am I right or am I right?

41:07.167 --> 41:09.000
Good way to end the day.

41:09.251 --> 41:11.337
What day?

42:06.725 --> 42:08.892
Oh, yeah, you're so big.

42:09.059 --> 42:11.062
You're such a big girl.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.689
Aren't you, sweetie?

42:15.774 --> 42:17.736
Yeah.

42:17.901 --> 42:19.903
Yeah.

42:32.876 --> 42:34.627
Yeah.

42:34.793 --> 42:38.839
Yeah, you're gonna go
on a big, big, big trip.

42:39.007 --> 42:42.259
- We're not gonna push too hard.
- She usually does okay in the car.

42:42.426 --> 42:44.593
I love you, Suze.

42:45.846 --> 42:48.181
Hurry and come visit.

42:49.224 --> 42:50.559
Can you put her in the seat?

42:53.271 --> 42:54.896
Oh, no.

42:55.063 --> 42:57.524
- Here we go, sweetie.
- Oh, no, sweet pea, don't cry.

42:57.941 --> 43:00.444
- Watch her head.
- Yeah. There you go.

43:00.609 --> 43:03.488
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no, sweet pea, don't cry.

43:04.614 --> 43:07.826
Yeah, it's okay. Yeah.

43:07.993 --> 43:10.119
Oh, my- Where's Mr. B?

43:10.287 --> 43:12.664
- Who?
- That ratty pink and blue bear.

43:12.831 --> 43:15.834
I put him by the door.
She cannot ride without him.

43:16.001 --> 43:18.252
- Did you pack it?
- I don't know.

43:18.419 --> 43:21.212
I know I left it by the door.
Where is B?

43:21.379 --> 43:24.050
Oh, yeah. It's okay.
Yeah, we'll find him.

43:24.467 --> 43:27.136
- Here. Here, will this work?
- No, it has to be the bear.

43:27.303 --> 43:29.722
She can't sleep either. Damn it!

43:29.889 --> 43:31.224
Okay, I'll go look upstairs.

43:49.199 --> 43:51.158
Okay.

43:51.325 --> 43:55.831
Okay. Yeah, I'm still looking!
It's okay, Susie!

44:07.634 --> 44:10.137
Goddamn it, Mr. B!

44:10.303 --> 44:12.431
Where are you?

44:12.597 --> 44:14.349
Susie!

44:14.516 --> 44:17.144
Hey, Susie! It's okay!

44:17.310 --> 44:18.602
We found it!

44:23.483 --> 44:27.028
Yeah. Yeah!
Everything's gonna be okay now.

44:27.195 --> 44:31.448
- There you go, yeah.
- Look. We found it, sweetie.

44:31.616 --> 44:33.033
No, no, you do it.

44:37.204 --> 44:39.677
Here's Mr. B. See? Come on.

44:53.419 --> 44:55.290
Yeah.
