No idea.

seem to really love it.

These --
uh, these customers,

10:00.460 --> 10:06.290

on that side,

there was a cheesemonger
over on this side

was double theirs.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.000

Oh, long gone.

Everything is changing,

15:06.920 --> 15:09.000
That is pretty smart.

I raised Gus's rent by, like,

$30 a month, if that.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.920

real harm!

30:53.170 --> 30:55.960
I am so sorry.
How is your shoulder?

30:55.960 --> 30:57.580
Do you think
you might need X

30:57.580 --> 30:58.790
You better hope
he doesn't need X-rays.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.210
I'll be fine.

31:00.210 --> 31:01.580
I'm so glad.
I am so mad!

31:01.580 --> 31:03.420
I'm sorry.

31:03.420 --> 31:04.580
Yeah, well, you have
a lot of time to think

31:04.580 --> 31:07.580
about it because you are
so supremely grounded.

31:07.580 --> 31:08.580
For how long?

31:08.580 --> 31:09.750
Forever.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.290
Well, my friends already
think I'm lame

31:11.290 --> 31:15.250
for asking permission so I guess
things can't get any worse.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.290
Yeah, well, okay.

31:17.290 --> 31:19.000
You can just march on
upstairs now

31:19.000 --> 31:21.170
and tell your little
friends that you got busted

31:21.170 --> 31:23.460
sneaking out of the house
because you hit a police officer

31:23.460 --> 31:25.250
while stealing my truck.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.420

all those words?

31:26.420 --> 31:28.170
Yes, word for word.

31:28.170 --> 31:31.540
Should I say that he was
sneaking into your room?

31:31.540 --> 31:33.290
Not those words.

31:35.580 --> 31:37.540
I'm sorry.
That was super-stupid.

31:37.540 --> 31:39.170
Apology accepted.

31:45.540 --> 31:47.540
Are you angry or happy?

31:47.540 --> 31:49.880
It's getting hard to track.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.420
I mean, I know what
she did was terrible,

31:51.420 --> 31:54.670
but
she has friends.

31:54.670 --> 31:55.750
Great?

31:55.750 --> 31:57.620
Six months ago,
she was just

31:57.620 --> 32:00.040
cutting herself off
completely to everyone.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.380
And, I don't know,
look at her now.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.420
And now she's got
a bad-ass story to tell

32:04.420 --> 32:05.330

while she's grounded.

32:05.330 --> 32:06.750
Well, I'm glad
my bruised ribs

32:06.750 --> 32:09.170

daughter's street cred.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.710
Okay, well -- I just
wanted to help!

33:18.960 --> 33:20.330
Well...

33:20.330 --> 33:24.080
You know, uh, I have
a theory about that, actually.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.620
Look, we've been
interacting with human beings

33:26.620 --> 33:29.000
ever since we got here,
and now we're getting injured,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.460
you know, we're feeling pain,
we're feeling emotions.

33:31.460 --> 33:33.040
Oh, God, the emotions.

33:33.040 --> 33:37.420
To be blunt, I -- I think
we're becoming more human.

33:38.710 --> 33:42.330
We're also gaining
more humanity.

33:42.330 --> 33:43.670
You say that like
it's a good thing!

33:43.670 --> 33:45.040
It is a good thing!

33:45.040 --> 33:46.830
It's because of humanity
that you wanted

33:46.830 --> 33:48.830
to tell Tyler the truth.

33:48.830 --> 33:51.040
It's because of humanity
that we can freely admit

33:51.040 --> 33:53.500
to ourselves that
we're not perfect.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.040
That's something neither
you or I would have

33:55.040 --> 33:57.460
ever done before.

33:57.460 --> 34:00.380
Look, th--this place,
these people,

34:00.380 --> 34:02.380
they've changed us.
That much is true.

34:02.380 --> 34:04.460
But have you
considered that

34:04.460 --> 34:05.830
maybe that's for the better?

34:15.420 --> 34:17.790
Tyler: I ruined poor Gus.

34:17.790 --> 34:20.500
Destroyed his business.

34:20.500 --> 34:23.380
This is completely
my fault.

34:23.380 --> 34:27.210
No, it's really not.

34:27.210 --> 34:28.960
It is.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.750
No.

34:30.750 --> 34:32.540

even doing here?

34:32.540 --> 34:35.920
I came out,
chasing Leslie,

34:35.920 --> 34:39.040
and I don't think
that's happening either.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.290
Yeah,
maybe you're right.

34:41.290 --> 34:44.580
Why would anyone even want
to be with me, anyway?

34:44.580 --> 34:47.750
On the bright side, I'm heading
back to Texas, pronto.

34:47.750 --> 34:50.670
Wait. No. Um...

34:50.670 --> 34:54.080
What if you stay here
a little while longer?

34:54.080 --> 34:58.710

someone will show.

Let's go get a drink,

35:04.080 --> 35:07.380
Okay.
Okay.

35:07.380 --> 35:09.540
Thanks for being
such a good friend.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.170

Um, go get us a table.

40:59.420 --> 41:02.040
I mean, everything
after Gus is --

41:02.040 --> 41:04.330
it's a bit of a haze for me

41:04.330 --> 41:06.580
but, uh, we must have
tied one on, right?

41:06.580 --> 41:08.040
Like in Laos.

41:08.040 --> 41:10.580
You might have.
I took off right after that.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.420
Oh, you did?
Yeah.

41:12.420 --> 41:13.960
After what you did to me,
I couldn't stand

41:13.960 --> 41:16.380
to look at your face
for another second.

41:18.290 --> 41:21.380
Tyler, again,
I'm so sorry.

41:21.380 --> 41:24.120
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't apologize.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.460
I'm glad you did
what you did.

41:25.460 --> 41:26.420
Okay.

41:26.420 --> 41:27.880
Now I don't have to
waste my time

41:27.880 --> 41:31.170
with someone who's clearly
not my friend...

41:31.170 --> 41:33.620
at all.

41:33.620 --> 41:36.210
That's not true.

41:36.210 --> 41:37.710
You know what?

41:37.710 --> 41:40.620
I'm going to get someone else
to take your order.

41:40.620 --> 41:43.000
I'm done here.
