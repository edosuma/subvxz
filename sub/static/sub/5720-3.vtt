00:37.030 --> 00:37.750
Hello.

00:37.751 --> 00:40.119
DALTON: I wanted to
express my condolences...

00:40.120 --> 00:42.622
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:42.623 --> 00:45.625
My husband held you in
great esteem, as well.

00:45.626 --> 00:47.927
I'm sending Secretary McCord.

00:47.928 --> 00:50.730
I see.

00:50.731 --> 00:52.865
Very well. I understand.

00:52.866 --> 00:56.269
Secretary McCord will
be most welcome then.

00:56.270 --> 00:57.470
(Dalton speaks indistinctly)

00:57.471 --> 01:00.005
Thank you again. Good-bye.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.010
How did she sound?

01:04.010 --> 01:05.311
Like her husband just died.

01:05.312 --> 01:07.212
CRAIG: So, like a Russian.

01:08.081 --> 01:09.949
What? Too soon?

01:09.950 --> 01:12.218
I think we should talk
about what comes next.

01:12.219 --> 01:14.721
Sir, unless a strong successor to Ostrov

01:14.722 --> 01:16.356
is put in place quickly...

01:16.357 --> 01:18.424
Which is unlikely, given
Ostrov's deliberately built

01:18.425 --> 01:19.759
the entire state around himself.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.828
Concentric rings of instability

01:21.829 --> 01:23.696
are gonna ripple across
Russia and the globe.

01:23.697 --> 01:24.964
JACKSON: Briefing's in five minutes.

01:24.965 --> 01:26.099
We should talk on the way.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.201
DALTON: So, no confidence in Rozovsky?

01:28.202 --> 01:29.902
JACKSON: Well, he's acting president

01:29.903 --> 01:32.238
until he calls for
elections, but the man's got

01:32.239 --> 01:33.673
the backbone of a wet sponge.

01:33.674 --> 01:35.141
So either there's a power vacuum

01:35.142 --> 01:37.310
and possibly a civil war or some general

01:37.311 --> 01:39.979
who's even more hard-line than
Ostrov winds up in charge.

01:39.980 --> 01:42.715
Both options would be a
disaster for U.S. security.

01:42.716 --> 01:44.784
Our best bulwark is to push back hard

01:44.785 --> 01:46.853
with a strong, clear agenda of our own.

01:46.854 --> 01:48.921
You're arguing for direct
military aid to Ukraine?

01:48.922 --> 01:50.323
For starters, sir, yes.

01:50.324 --> 01:53.092
Put an end to this "Greater
Russia" nonsense right now

01:53.093 --> 01:55.094
while they're down.

01:55.095 --> 01:57.864
Mr. President, with respect,

01:57.865 --> 02:01.300
Russia is already completely
on edge about our intentions.

02:01.301 --> 02:03.302
We've had some pretty close calls

02:03.303 --> 02:04.771
over the last six months.

02:04.772 --> 02:06.739
- Due to their provocations.
- Agreed.

02:06.740 --> 02:08.074
No one's calling them
the good guys here,

02:08.074 --> 02:11.244
but if we escalate and someone
over there gets jittery,

02:11.245 --> 02:12.512
it could go nuclear.

02:12.513 --> 02:14.380
JACKSON: World War III.

02:14.381 --> 02:16.515
Not exactly great for your poll numbers.

02:17.784 --> 02:18.918
What do you suggest?

02:18.919 --> 02:22.555
I think Foreign Minister
Gorev is our best hope

02:22.556 --> 02:25.224
for a decent partner in Russia.

02:25.225 --> 02:26.826
We can help him get there.

02:26.827 --> 02:27.894
How?

02:27.895 --> 02:30.263
We use him to reach out to the generals.

02:30.264 --> 02:32.465
They're the real power behind the throne,

02:32.466 --> 02:34.300
- whoever sits on it.
- And tell them what?

02:34.301 --> 02:36.569
That we're interested
in improving relations

02:36.570 --> 02:38.604
on a host of issues, including Ukraine.

02:38.605 --> 02:40.406
They're not all warmongers,

02:40.407 --> 02:43.276
and they have reasons to
want to make a deal with us.

02:43.277 --> 02:47.947
And if they do, Gorev is
the man that got us there.

02:47.948 --> 02:49.549
CRAIG: That's a big "if"

02:49.550 --> 02:51.818
between you and your glorious era

02:51.819 --> 02:54.821
- of Neo-Glasnost, Madam Secretary.
- DALTON: I want a plan

02:54.822 --> 02:56.389
before you leave for Russia tomorrow.

02:56.390 --> 02:58.825
Yes, sir.

02:58.826 --> 03:00.159
JACKSON: Mr. President,

03:00.160 --> 03:03.062
Mr. Shaw here is going
to brief us on the hack

03:03.063 --> 03:04.630
of Air Force One.

03:04.631 --> 03:06.032
Make it quick, son.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.500
Russia's imploding.

03:07.501 --> 03:09.469
OLIVER: We still don't know who
perpetrated the attack, sir,

03:09.470 --> 03:12.271
but whoever it was...
they've managed to develop

03:12.272 --> 03:15.041
next-gen kinetic cyber
intrusion capabilities

03:15.042 --> 03:17.343
beyond anything in America's arsenal.

03:17.344 --> 03:20.012
So we're facing an unknown enemy
who's better armed than us.

03:20.013 --> 03:21.981
We're probably talking
about Russia, China,

03:21.982 --> 03:23.616
Iran, maybe North Korea, right?

03:23.617 --> 03:25.485
Yes, ma'am, but the
hackers were very good

03:25.486 --> 03:26.686
about covering their tracks.

03:26.687 --> 03:28.187
DALTON: And we still
don't know if they could

03:28.188 --> 03:29.489
pull off another such attack?

03:29.490 --> 03:30.723
My team and I are working

03:30.724 --> 03:32.391
around the clock to prevent
that from happening.

03:32.392 --> 03:33.659
But no.

03:33.660 --> 03:34.827
JACKSON: So, bottom line is,

03:34.828 --> 03:37.096
Air Force One is still grounded?

03:37.097 --> 03:38.231
I'm afraid so, sir.

03:38.232 --> 03:41.132
But my plane's good to go, right?

03:43.436 --> 03:45.203
Excellent.

03:46.372 --> 03:48.328
"The era of Neo-Glasnost"?
He actually said that?

03:48.329 --> 03:49.054
- Yeah.

03:49.055 --> 03:51.544
- Oh.
- The guy is such an assh... Hi...

03:51.545 --> 03:52.779
- Hey.
- ...baby!

03:52.780 --> 03:53.980
What you got there, son?

03:53.981 --> 03:55.214
His summer school report card.

03:55.215 --> 03:56.349
(singsongy): It's gonna su-uck!

03:56.350 --> 03:57.617
- Ali...
- Yeah.

03:57.618 --> 03:59.685
Be nice. I'm excited.

03:59.686 --> 04:01.954
Really excited. And, listen,
son, whatever's in there...

04:01.955 --> 04:03.356
we're both really proud of you.

04:03.357 --> 04:05.057
ELIZABETH: Holy crap.

04:05.058 --> 04:06.425
Holy crap.

04:06.426 --> 04:08.127
Two As and a B-plus?!

04:08.128 --> 04:10.530
(laughs) I knew you could do it.

04:10.531 --> 04:11.898
- Thanks, Mom.
- I'm so proud of you.

04:11.899 --> 04:13.462
- (imitates explosion)
- ALISON: All right, up top.

04:13.463 --> 04:14.433
You win.

04:14.434 --> 04:16.601
Hey, let's talk about an
"A" in Geometry? Dude.

04:16.603 --> 04:18.070
- Thanks.
- ELIZABETH: Yeah.

04:18.071 --> 04:20.872
Actually, um, let's talk... about this.

04:22.809 --> 04:26.544
Permission slip to try
out for football? Huh.

04:27.647 --> 04:29.981
Really?

04:30.583 --> 04:32.417
Really.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.690
(laughs)

04:37.691 --> 04:39.325
(water running)

04:39.326 --> 04:42.328
He totally rope-a-doped us with
that report card, didn't he?

04:42.329 --> 04:44.931
Well, if his long con was
getting great grades all summer

04:44.932 --> 04:46.966
so he could try out
for the football team,

04:46.967 --> 04:48.134
that's fine with me.

04:48.135 --> 04:49.569
Well, are you also fine

04:49.570 --> 04:51.838
with him potentially ruining
his knees or his brain?

04:51.839 --> 04:53.773
Oh, come on, babe. That's...

04:53.774 --> 04:55.908
Do I need to show you the studies?

04:55.909 --> 04:57.343
I'm just saying that it might be good

04:57.344 --> 04:58.778
for him to be part of a team.

04:58.779 --> 05:00.313
That's another thing.

05:00.314 --> 05:03.683
How is it that our proud
little anarchist weirdo

05:03.684 --> 05:06.485
wants to play football of all things?

05:06.486 --> 05:08.888
Well, he's actually
a pretty fast runner.

05:08.889 --> 05:10.857
And, hey, sometimes doing the thing

05:10.858 --> 05:13.292
that seems the least
punk rock is actually

05:13.293 --> 05:15.127
the most punk rock act of all.

05:15.128 --> 05:17.263
Okay.

05:17.264 --> 05:19.031
Thank you, Joe Strummer.
I'll keep that in mind.

05:19.032 --> 05:20.566
But can we just

05:20.567 --> 05:22.468
please hold off on
signing that permission slip

05:22.469 --> 05:23.636
until I get back?

05:23.637 --> 05:27.373
Maybe you can work your
magic and figure out

05:27.374 --> 05:29.242
why he's hot on this all of the sudden.

05:29.243 --> 05:31.611
- Fair enough. Magic will be worked.
- Okay.

05:31.612 --> 05:34.614
Which one of these dresses says,

05:34.615 --> 05:38.451
"I'm terribly sorry your
heartless autocrat husband

05:38.452 --> 05:40.086
is finally dead."

05:40.087 --> 05:43.589
Well, I know which one makes
this heartless autocrat

05:43.590 --> 05:46.092
of a husband glad he's not dead.

05:46.093 --> 05:49.629
Oh, my God, that is
the lamest come-on line ever.

05:49.630 --> 05:52.064
I mean, that's...

05:52.065 --> 05:54.267
(laughing):
That is the stupidest thing...

05:54.268 --> 05:56.502
And yet, it's working.

05:56.503 --> 05:59.105
ELIZABETH: <i>Ostrov</i>

05:59.106 --> 06:01.173
antagonized America for domestic reasons,

06:01.174 --> 06:03.075
to maintain his grip on power.

06:03.076 --> 06:05.244
Now he's dead.

06:05.245 --> 06:08.547
Am I crazy to think there's a
window of opportunity here?

06:08.548 --> 06:10.483
NADINE: I agree, ma'am.

06:10.484 --> 06:13.252
But the question is:
what do the generals want?

06:13.253 --> 06:14.487
DAISY: To get out from under

06:14.488 --> 06:15.855
the sanctions we slapped on them?

06:15.856 --> 06:18.257
And to back out of Ostrov's
stupid war of choice

06:18.258 --> 06:19.625
in Eastern Ukraine.

06:19.626 --> 06:23.429
So, can we give them a way to
declare victory and go home?

06:23.430 --> 06:24.730
MATT: But why?

06:24.731 --> 06:26.299
Ultimately, they win on the battlefield.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.067
JAY: 'Cause it's costing far more lives

06:28.068 --> 06:30.369
and rubles than they want to admit.

06:30.370 --> 06:34.273
What if we can convince
the Ukrainians to sign off

06:34.274 --> 06:36.642
on a vote for greater
autonomy in the east?

06:36.643 --> 06:38.744
- It's rewarding Russian aggression.
- It's also the fig leaf

06:38.745 --> 06:40.212
they need.

06:40.213 --> 06:41.847
And what does the
government in Kiev get,

06:41.848 --> 06:44.450
besides potentially signing
away half of their country?

06:44.451 --> 06:47.420
Peace in a war they can't win.

06:47.421 --> 06:48.721
Serious military guarantees

06:48.722 --> 06:50.289
from us for Western Ukraine

06:50.290 --> 06:52.425
if the east <i>does</i> vote
for greater autonomy.

06:52.426 --> 06:55.895
And if the vote is fair,
it may even go Kiev's way.

06:55.896 --> 06:58.264
Also, if Gorev's the guy who
got the sanctions lifted,

06:58.265 --> 07:00.166
he'll look pretty good
to the Russian people.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.435
NADINE: And from an
American perspective,

07:02.436 --> 07:04.403
a President Gorev is certainly

07:04.404 --> 07:06.372
the least bad option on the table.

07:06.373 --> 07:09.542
Ha! Look at that. Everybody wins.

07:09.543 --> 07:12.044
Blake, will you get Foreign
Minister Gorev on the phone?

07:12.045 --> 07:14.246
Thank you.

07:14.247 --> 07:15.681
I'll tell the secretary
the foreign minister

07:15.682 --> 07:17.583
will call her back in a few minutes.
Thank you.

07:17.584 --> 07:18.918
- (barks)
- Is she in?

07:18.919 --> 07:20.586
Uh, she's a little busy.

07:20.587 --> 07:22.555
Hey, take Gordon outside
while I'm in there, will you?

07:22.556 --> 07:23.889
What? No, I'm a little busy, too.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.791
So, get an intern to do it, delegate.

07:25.792 --> 07:27.593
Honestly, I'm concerned about
your problem-solving skills.

07:27.594 --> 07:29.795
- (barks) - Oh, and you're gonna...
you're gonna want that.

07:29.796 --> 07:32.064
Someone's had a lot
of treats this morning,

07:32.065 --> 07:33.299
hasn't someone? Yes, someone has.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.267
(barks, whines)

07:35.268 --> 07:36.802
You have a Craig Sterling problem,

07:36.803 --> 07:38.704
- and we need to talk about it.
- Good morning.

07:38.705 --> 07:39.839
'Cause if you don't get this

07:39.840 --> 07:41.941
under control, you are
going to be boxed out

07:41.942 --> 07:43.409
of POTUS's inner circle.

07:43.410 --> 07:44.910
Is that even geometrically possible?

07:44.911 --> 07:46.312
And when that happens,

07:46.313 --> 07:48.748
you will leave office with no
legacy, which, in this town, is

07:48.749 --> 07:51.116
worse than being dead.

07:51.817 --> 07:54.520
Have I told you how sad I feel

07:54.521 --> 07:56.956
for literally everyone who lives here?

07:56.957 --> 07:59.258
It's getting around that you are

07:59.259 --> 08:01.027
on the outs with the White House.

08:01.028 --> 08:02.695
Because Craig is leaking it.

08:02.696 --> 08:04.964
Because POTUS and Russell
Jackson want him to.

08:04.965 --> 08:08.234
Are you listening now? Good.

08:08.235 --> 08:10.669
'Cause here's the thing:
right now you are the face

08:10.670 --> 08:12.505
of the administration's
successes in foreign policy,

08:12.506 --> 08:13.873
not Dalton.

08:13.874 --> 08:15.174
Oh, come on.

08:15.175 --> 08:18.044
Okay, don't "Aw, shucks" me, okay?

08:18.045 --> 08:19.678
These guys have a reelection to win.

08:19.679 --> 08:21.847
They brought Sterling
in to ride herd on you.

08:21.848 --> 08:24.150
- They want to be seen as running the show.
- Fine.

08:24.151 --> 08:26.185
- Let them. It's their show!
- Bess, listen to me!

08:26.186 --> 08:28.521
If you plant your flag on this
Russia thing, you need to win.

08:28.522 --> 08:30.956
Because if you don't, your
credibility with POTUS is shot.

08:30.957 --> 08:33.192
And by the way, Craig
Sterling is gaming it

08:33.193 --> 08:34.592
so that you won't win.

08:34.594 --> 08:36.462
You need to push back.

08:36.462 --> 08:38.597
Why bother?

08:38.597 --> 08:43.135
I mean, you're saying
that even if I win, I lose.

08:43.135 --> 08:45.371
Because if you lose, you lose worse.

08:45.372 --> 08:47.373
(sighs)

08:47.374 --> 08:48.808
What do you have in mind?

08:48.809 --> 08:51.544
I could put together a binder.

08:51.545 --> 08:55.780
No. I am not doing oppo
research on a colleague.

08:56.482 --> 08:58.617
Think of it as interesting trivia,

08:58.618 --> 09:00.086
if that helps.

09:00.087 --> 09:02.354
If I can't win on the merits,
then I deserve to be boxed out.

09:02.355 --> 09:04.190
Of the circle, which,

09:04.191 --> 09:06.759
- again, makes no sense.
- BLAKE: Ma'am?

09:06.760 --> 09:09.028
I have Foreign Minister
Gorev for you on SVTC.

09:09.029 --> 09:10.796
Great. Put him through.

09:10.797 --> 09:13.065
No binder.

09:13.066 --> 09:16.434
Don't say I didn't warn you.

09:18.370 --> 09:20.539
GOREV: <i>But we have no troops in Ukraine.</i>

09:20.540 --> 09:23.442
And if we did, why would we
pull them out? We're winning.

09:23.443 --> 09:24.844
ELIZABETH: Maybe, but there are

09:24.845 --> 09:26.679
an awful lot of trucks
filled with coffins

09:26.680 --> 09:28.814
driving back to Russia
in the dead of night.

09:28.815 --> 09:33.419
Also, with the sanctions still
in place, your economy has

09:33.420 --> 09:36.555
about as much chance of coming
back to life as Pavel Ostrov.

09:36.556 --> 09:38.657
May his memory be eternal.

09:38.658 --> 09:41.694
And why do you want me to broker
this deal with the generals?

09:41.695 --> 09:45.197
Because they know that you
are both an honest broker

09:45.198 --> 09:46.532
and a patriot.

09:46.533 --> 09:50.536
Two traits they would perhaps
admire in a president, no?

09:50.537 --> 09:54.440
You're playing on my vanity and
ambition here, I'm assuming.

09:54.441 --> 09:56.442
And your sense of duty.

09:56.443 --> 09:57.977
(sighs)

09:57.978 --> 10:00.980
Do you think the generals
would be open to my proposal?

10:00.981 --> 10:05.784
They might be if negotiations
were handled discreetly.

10:05.785 --> 10:08.187
Of course.

10:08.188 --> 10:10.689
Peace and prosperity.

10:10.690 --> 10:12.892
That's what I'm offering, Anton.

10:12.893 --> 10:15.528
I'm just glad you're not
making me drink to them.

10:15.529 --> 10:17.863
Two days of nothing but
black bread and vodka?

10:17.864 --> 10:20.866
I tell you, Ostrov's death
is going to kill <i>me.</i>

10:20.867 --> 10:24.136
Well, don't kick the bucket yet.
I need you.

10:24.137 --> 10:26.105
I'm moved by your concern.

10:26.106 --> 10:28.406
I'll be in touch, Elizabeth.

10:31.977 --> 10:34.046
IVAN: <i>Russia</i>

10:34.047 --> 10:36.916
needed results, and
Pavel Ostrov delivered!

10:36.917 --> 10:38.284
The man was a dictator

10:38.285 --> 10:40.052
with the temperament
of Ivan the Terrible...

10:40.053 --> 10:41.220
This is exactly why...

10:41.221 --> 10:42.388
...and the looks of Leonid Brezhnev.

10:42.389 --> 10:43.722
...the United Kingdom
is no longer an empire.

10:43.723 --> 10:45.891
Good morning. Good morning, all.
Good morning, everybody.

10:45.892 --> 10:47.359
I think, in light of recent events,

10:47.360 --> 10:50.563
we should take a few minutes
before diving into your papers

10:50.564 --> 10:55.568
on the theory of the Just War,
which were, sadly, just okay.

10:55.569 --> 10:58.170
So, does anybody else have

10:58.171 --> 11:01.941
anything they want to say about
the passing of President Ostrov?

11:01.942 --> 11:03.642
Frankly, the man looked like
he'd been dead for years.

11:03.643 --> 11:04.910
President Pavel Ostrov

11:04.911 --> 11:08.247
restored Russia to its rightful
place as a great power.

11:08.248 --> 11:10.382
He took back lands that
were stolen from us,

11:10.383 --> 11:11.650
rebuilt our economy,

11:11.651 --> 11:12.751
and, through his strength,

11:12.752 --> 11:14.453
made the world respect us

11:14.454 --> 11:16.487
once again.

11:21.227 --> 11:22.528
Well, cheers,

11:22.529 --> 11:24.096
lads, for that scene from a Soviet

11:24.097 --> 11:25.598
propaganda film.

11:25.599 --> 11:27.266
Okay.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.268
Anybody else want to weigh in?

11:29.269 --> 11:30.836
All right, let's get started.

11:30.837 --> 11:32.171
CRAIG: <i>So Gorev claims</i>

11:32.172 --> 11:33.572
he can deliver the generals.

11:33.573 --> 11:36.175
But how exactly do you plan
to deliver the Ukrainians?

11:36.176 --> 11:38.310
I would pitch this to President Bozek

11:38.311 --> 11:41.180
when I stop in Kiev en route to Moscow.

11:41.181 --> 11:44.550
It is the best outcome he can hope for.

11:44.551 --> 11:49.154
Best for us, too, if it lands
Gorev in the top spot.

11:49.155 --> 11:51.457
Make the ask to Bozek when
you get to Ukraine, Bess.

11:51.458 --> 11:53.425
If he signs off, Gorev can set a meeting

11:53.426 --> 11:55.426
between you and the generals in Moscow.

11:56.495 --> 11:58.197
That'll be all.

11:58.198 --> 12:00.266
Thank you, sir.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.801
Oh, hey, uh, Craig.

12:02.802 --> 12:05.004
What can I do for you, Madam Secretary?

12:05.005 --> 12:07.273
Well, you can start by
calling me Elizabeth.

12:07.274 --> 12:10.542
- Sure.
- Listen... (sighs) we may not be

12:10.543 --> 12:12.344
on the same side of every issue,

12:12.345 --> 12:14.880
but we are on the same team.

12:14.881 --> 12:16.181
How about we have lunch sometime?

12:16.182 --> 12:19.418
Trying to make nice with
Russia is dangerous folly.

12:19.419 --> 12:20.853
You may have won this round,

12:20.854 --> 12:23.222
but I won't rest until the
president understands that.

12:23.223 --> 12:27.393
Wait. So, just to parse the metaphor:

12:27.394 --> 12:29.495
now we're in a boxing match,

12:29.496 --> 12:32.231
a sport in which, of course,
there are no teams,

12:32.232 --> 12:34.099
just two guys punching it out?

12:34.100 --> 12:35.668
Is that where we are?

12:35.669 --> 12:38.904
Fine. You want to have lunch,
Elizabeth? Let's have lunch.

12:38.905 --> 12:42.508
Great. I'll have my office set it up.

12:42.509 --> 12:45.477
Uh, so we're clear... (clears throat)

12:45.478 --> 12:48.814
you improvised your way to
some wins in your first year.

12:48.815 --> 12:50.049
No doubt about it.

12:50.050 --> 12:52.384
But when it comes to foreign
policy, what this nation

12:52.385 --> 12:55.587
needs is a strong, clear strategy.

12:55.588 --> 12:58.257
Now, the president brought me
in to deliver exactly that,

12:58.258 --> 12:59.692
which should tell you something

12:59.693 --> 13:03.961
about his estimation
of your achievements.

13:05.597 --> 13:08.000
Still want to have that lunch?

13:08.001 --> 13:12.303
Everyone's raving about the
salmon croquettes at Girard's.

13:15.112 --> 13:21.290
_ _

13:29.987 --> 13:32.254
Better papers next time, guys.

13:32.956 --> 13:35.491
Hey.

13:39.229 --> 13:42.689
Don't you think you protested
a little much there?

13:42.690 --> 13:45.391
Maybe I was sincerely
grieving for my country.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.992
Remember sincerity, Professor?

13:48.494 --> 13:50.530
We need you to go to the Russian Embassy.

13:50.531 --> 13:53.733
There's a memorial for President
Ostrov tomorrow at 6:00.

13:53.734 --> 13:54.767
Yes, I was invited.

13:54.768 --> 13:55.935
We know.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.637
We'd like you to approach
Ambassador Zinchenko

13:57.638 --> 13:59.439
if you can, see if you can get his take

13:59.440 --> 14:01.007
on who might replace Ostrov.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.909
He deals with generals,
not no-name captains.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.377
That will be suspicious.

14:04.378 --> 14:06.346
Eh, it doesn't have to be.
He's a man who's known to drink,

14:06.347 --> 14:08.948
and it's an occasion where
everyone else will be, too.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.917
What happens if I fail?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.185
Hmm?

14:12.186 --> 14:13.886
Do you know what they
do to spies in Russia?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.021
We won't let that happen.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.255
And, besides, it's just a conversation.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.930
And if I refuse?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.672
How's your sister?

14:35.108 --> 14:38.077
She arrived in Stockholm yesterday.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.413
They've admitted her into the drug trial.

14:40.414 --> 14:42.415
And, yes, I remember the deal we made.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.884
Good.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.587
I'll be in touch afterwards
for the debrief.

14:47.588 --> 14:49.889
You can do this, Dmitri.

14:49.890 --> 14:53.226
I'm honored by your
confidence, Professor McCord.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.228
(door opens)

14:55.229 --> 14:57.362
(door shuts)

14:59.899 --> 15:01.901
I've always said this
room needed a tent.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.303
As you can see, the upgraded
Secure Communications Tent

15:04.304 --> 15:07.240
features soundproof fabric,
capable of blocking any long-

15:07.241 --> 15:09.976
or short-range attempts at surveillance.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.945
If you'll just follow me inside.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.614
That little guy projects

15:14.615 --> 15:16.449
a ring of electronic waves

15:16.450 --> 15:18.785
that block any other
attempts at surveillance.

15:18.786 --> 15:20.319
In light of the Air Force One hack,

15:20.320 --> 15:21.688
the president wanted to take

15:21.689 --> 15:24.323
every precaution for the
secretary's trip to Russia.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.491
Famous last words.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.793
Excuse me?

15:26.794 --> 15:29.395
It's a plane thing.
She's, uh, a little uneasy

15:29.396 --> 15:32.265
since the secretary read
us in about Air Force One.

15:32.266 --> 15:34.767
On that note, I wanted to
personally assure the secretary

15:34.768 --> 15:36.736
that my team has run
every possible diagnostic

15:36.737 --> 15:37.804
on her plane.

15:37.805 --> 15:39.338
- It's all come back clean.
- Okay.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.274
Well, I'll let the secretary know.

15:41.275 --> 15:42.842
Thank you so much for your time.

15:42.843 --> 15:44.977
One question: how old are you?

15:44.978 --> 15:46.846
What?

15:46.847 --> 15:48.681
Seriously, how old?

15:48.682 --> 15:51.050
I'm 30. Uh, I graduated college at 17,

15:51.051 --> 15:53.753
moved to Silicon Valley, started
my first company at 21...

15:53.754 --> 15:56.089
God, why is our culture
so obsessed with youth?

15:56.090 --> 15:57.957
If someone's gonna tell
me a plane's safe,

15:57.958 --> 15:59.859
I want it to be a grown-ass man.

15:59.860 --> 16:01.094
NADINE: Or woman.

16:01.095 --> 16:02.706
DAISY: Anyone but a child is the point.

16:02.707 --> 16:04.497
BLAKE: All right, Daisy,
maybe we shouldn't yell

16:04.498 --> 16:06.466
at our nation's top
cybersecurity official.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.568
Look, I totally get your concerns.

16:08.569 --> 16:09.836
But trust me,

16:09.837 --> 16:11.570
you're in good hands.

16:12.238 --> 16:13.773
MATT: Okay, man,

16:13.774 --> 16:15.208
- don't make it weird.
- Thank you

16:15.209 --> 16:16.843
so much for coming in.

16:16.844 --> 16:19.645
I'm sure that the secretary
will feel very reassured.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.447
OLIVER: And, look, if you want
to worry about something,

16:21.448 --> 16:24.217
- worry about simple mechanical issues.
- Okay!

16:24.218 --> 16:25.852
Compared to Air Force One,

16:25.853 --> 16:27.620
the secretary's plane's
a real rust bucket.

16:27.621 --> 16:29.989
- BLAKE: Oh!
- NADINE: Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.157
Bye-bye.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.059
Great.

16:33.060 --> 16:37.896
Now we're all just standing in a tent.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.235
BOZEK: <i>Madam Secretary,</i>

16:42.236 --> 16:44.570
I must confess, I'm...

16:44.571 --> 16:46.906
a bit taken aback by your proposal.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.708
Russia foments a civil war in my country,

16:48.709 --> 16:50.676
backed by a stealth invasion,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.146
and for this you want me to
reward them with a vote?

16:53.147 --> 16:56.115
A vote Kiev could well
win if it's a fair one.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.951
If you think it will be fair,
you don't know the Russians.

16:58.952 --> 17:01.988
- I know they want out of your country.
- Yes.

17:01.989 --> 17:04.757
So long as I give them half of it.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.660
The UN will oversee the vote.

17:07.661 --> 17:09.295
But, more importantly,

17:09.296 --> 17:11.763
if the east opts for greater autonomy,

17:11.765 --> 17:15.835
the west of Ukraine will receive
concrete security guarantees

17:15.836 --> 17:17.170
from the United States.

17:17.171 --> 17:20.205
Give them a way out, Mr. President,

17:20.207 --> 17:22.175
and the Russians will take it.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.010
Give <i>them</i> a way out?

17:24.011 --> 17:25.845
Our economy

17:25.846 --> 17:28.748
is in ruins, hospitals overflowing, roads

17:28.749 --> 17:31.684
choked with refugees,

17:31.685 --> 17:34.320
but now it falls to me
to protect their pride?

17:34.321 --> 17:36.455
It's awful,

17:36.456 --> 17:39.458
I know,

17:39.459 --> 17:42.060
but this is how wars are ended.

17:44.030 --> 17:48.100
If I told you what the Soviets
did to my grandparents,

17:48.101 --> 17:50.403
you wouldn't sleep for a month.

17:50.404 --> 17:53.406
But...

17:53.407 --> 17:55.942
if the Russians agree,

17:55.943 --> 17:57.475
so do I.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.546
God help me.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.814
(distant cheering, music)

18:01.815 --> 18:03.282
You hear that?

18:03.283 --> 18:06.551
(humming)

18:08.688 --> 18:10.756
My people are celebrating.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.758
We all envy you, you know.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.263
Because, unlike us,

18:17.264 --> 18:20.999
you'll get to see that
bastard Ostrov in a box.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.003
Two minutes.

18:24.004 --> 18:26.005
WOMAN: He's here.

18:26.006 --> 18:27.940
Two-minute warning for the secretary.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.108
Copy that.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.444
Hey, American friend! Picture?

18:31.445 --> 18:32.945
What?

18:32.946 --> 18:34.747
Make picture, please?

18:34.748 --> 18:36.415
Oh, you-you want a photo?

18:36.416 --> 18:39.018
Is it okay if I just do
a quick photo? All right.

18:39.019 --> 18:40.686
Uh, I'm just gonna do
a quick photo with her.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.054
Great. All right.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.123
Your mom gonna take it? Here we go.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.391
All right. Thanks so much.

all right. Here we go.

So what are you saying,
Dmitri's not up for it?

19:00.474 --> 19:03.009
I'm saying he accepted the
job, but he seemed...

19:03.010 --> 19:05.411
rattled and resentful about it.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.747
That's because he's our bitch now.

19:07.748 --> 19:09.715
Look,

19:09.716 --> 19:11.951
I think he's solid, but maybe
we're pushing too hard,

19:11.952 --> 19:16.022
sending him on an op when
Ostrov's body isn't even cold.

19:16.023 --> 19:18.224
What, so we should hold his hand

19:18.225 --> 19:20.092
till he's finished the grieving process?

19:20.093 --> 19:23.229
Why don't you go grab yourself
an ice cream there, Scooter?

19:23.230 --> 19:26.766
Look, upstairs is freaking out
over what comes next in Russia.

19:26.767 --> 19:30.136
We need the Intel, Henry.
This has to happen.

19:30.137 --> 19:32.071
I'm just concerned about
Dmitri's state of mind.

19:32.072 --> 19:34.507
Well, as his handler, you're
the last word on that.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.642

damn problem then, don't we?

Mm. His poor wife.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.746
Yeah.

But, still, she was someone.
The wife of the big boss.

Now what's she gonna do,
win another beauty pageant?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.631
After the funeral tomorrow, she
shuffles off to Nice or Monaco,

21:05.632 --> 21:08.334
and that's that. It's kind of sad.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.136
Speaking of shuffling off,

21:10.137 --> 21:12.304
we should give the
secretary the heads-up.

She's got that meeting to prepare for.

Gorev should have confirmed
by now. Something's up.

Blake, you're seriously posing

II, some Ukrainians

21:37.998 --> 21:39.488

Ma'am, I'm so sorry I hugged a Nazi.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.517
Wasn't a Nazi.

trying to make us look bad.

Yes, ma'am. What are you going to say?

Whatever to keep this deal
from blowing up. Let's move.

22:08.962 --> 22:10.763
What did I say about discretion?

22:10.764 --> 22:13.365
You have to know that obviously
that picture's a setup.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.034
That is a nuance that will be lost

22:15.035 --> 22:16.302

The father of the nation is dead.

The people have no idea
what will happen next!

22:22.109 --> 22:23.709
Madam Secretary,

22:23.710 --> 22:26.679
I suggest that you attend
President Ostrov's funeral

22:26.680 --> 22:28.447
and then leave quietly.

22:28.448 --> 22:31.851
You're saying that you're
willing to sacrifice a chance

22:31.852 --> 22:34.186
at better relations with the United States

22:34.187 --> 22:35.988
over a stupid picture?

22:35.989 --> 22:39.058
This is a time when all
Russians must be very mindful

22:39.059 --> 22:40.826
of the moment we are in.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.027
Do you understand?

22:45.231 --> 22:46.465
Anton...

22:46.466 --> 22:48.399

22:49.135 --> 22:50.970

22:50.971 --> 22:52.538

Provided you pull your troops
out and it's supervised

22:55.275 --> 22:57.542
by the UN, yes.

22:58.277 --> 22:59.778
Bring the generals,

22:59.779 --> 23:01.347

23:20.569 --> 23:22.937
Of course he did. He said, and I quote,

23:22.938 --> 23:25.006
"I see all. I am the Pan-Opticon.

23:25.007 --> 23:26.608
Fix this or you're fired."

23:26.609 --> 23:28.505
Oh, God, I'm such an idiot.

23:28.506 --> 23:29.772
Yes, you are.

23:29.773 --> 23:32.963
You created a scandal that
could impact U.S. foreign policy

23:32.964 --> 23:35.598
for years to come because
you wanted to be nice.

23:35.599 --> 23:37.266
I was being diplomatic.

23:37.267 --> 23:38.935
I work for a diplomat.

23:38.936 --> 23:40.737
Face it, you're a people pleaser.

23:40.738 --> 23:42.305
Actually, I hate most people.

23:42.306 --> 23:44.741
It takes all of my skill to hide that.

23:44.742 --> 23:46.676

- Everyone understands

23:54.918 --> 23:56.918

23:56.919 --> 23:59.521
except, of course, the millions
of Russians who need to.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.624

how the hell it happened.

37:11.670 --> 37:13.571
You say I don't have a strategy,

37:13.572 --> 37:15.773
but you're suggesting
escalating a conflict

37:15.774 --> 37:18.676
the Ukrainians cannot win on their own,

37:18.677 --> 37:22.346
but that we have no intention
of engaging directly in?

to engage directly?

don't bring the dog!

ever hand me a poo-bag again,
