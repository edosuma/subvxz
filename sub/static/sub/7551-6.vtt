00:12.288 --> 00:13.954
Long flight?

00:13.989 --> 00:16.724
Endless. How much further?

00:16.758 --> 00:18.092
You have some time.

00:18.126 --> 00:20.027
If you want to sleep, go ahead, sir.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.897
[Engine roaring, passing]

00:22.931 --> 00:25.132
[Tires screech]

00:27.268 --> 00:29.336
[Gunshots]

00:37.042 --> 00:38.733
[Blade zings]

00:41.083 --> 00:43.584
[Exhales] Hey!
I made some coffee for you.

00:43.618 --> 00:46.019
It's insomniac strength. [Yawns]

00:46.053 --> 00:49.789
This is the fourth night in
a row that you haven't slept.

00:49.824 --> 00:51.525
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

00:51.559 --> 00:53.793
Maybe my subconscious
has a pressing need to...

00:53.828 --> 00:56.096
catch up on my Facebook likes.

00:56.130 --> 00:58.765
- Martha, good morning.
- Ah. Good morning, darling.

00:58.799 --> 01:00.800
- Would you like some breakfast?
- No, thank you.

01:00.835 --> 01:02.535
I'm, uh, fasting for clarity.

01:02.569 --> 01:06.472
I have been asked to read
for the new Stoppard play.

01:06.492 --> 01:07.473
So what's the problem?

01:07.493 --> 01:09.475
Well,
I haven't auditioned for anything in ages.

01:09.509 --> 01:11.978
I think I need to decide
if that particular train

01:12.012 --> 01:13.079
has left the station.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.114
[Chuckles]

01:16.516 --> 01:18.451
"Ms. Katherine Beckett"? What's this?

01:18.485 --> 01:22.121
Oh, an ex is getting married.
Do you remember Will Sorenson?

01:22.155 --> 01:23.856
- Your old F.B.I. squeeze?
- Yeah.

01:23.890 --> 01:25.658
Oh, man. I'm so lucky I came along

01:25.692 --> 01:28.394
- and saved you from that life.
- Wait. You saved me?

01:28.428 --> 01:30.730
Come on.
Even you have to admit he was boring.

01:30.764 --> 01:32.731
Like, c-span boring.

01:32.766 --> 01:34.800
You know, what makes you think

01:34.834 --> 01:37.102
that I would be with Sorenson
if you hadn't come along?

01:37.137 --> 01:38.403
All right, where would you be?

01:38.437 --> 01:40.839
- If you weren't around to distract me?
- Yeah.

01:40.874 --> 01:42.574
Um, I would probably be...

01:42.608 --> 01:44.810
captain of my own precinct.

01:44.844 --> 01:46.011
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:46.045 --> 01:48.413
Okay. Had I not been bewitched by you,

01:48.447 --> 01:51.182
I think by now I'd be working
on my second pulitzer.

01:51.216 --> 01:52.950
- So we're bad for each other, huh?
- The worst.

01:52.985 --> 01:54.252
Oh.

01:54.287 --> 01:56.020
I guess we'd both be better
off if we'd never met.

01:56.054 --> 01:58.323
[Cell phone rings]

01:58.357 --> 02:00.392
It's like "It's a wonderful life."

02:00.426 --> 02:04.962
Every time your phone rings,
a victim gets their wings.

02:04.997 --> 02:06.097
Beckett.

02:06.131 --> 02:08.833
Ryan: His name is Mathias Gensler.

02:08.866 --> 02:12.336
His passport indicates that
he is a swiss national.

02:12.370 --> 02:14.338
Witnesses said that two masked men

02:14.372 --> 02:16.473
attacked both the driver and Gensler

02:16.508 --> 02:18.776
before cutting a silver briefcase

02:18.811 --> 02:20.311
handcuffed to Mr. Gensler's wrist.

02:20.345 --> 02:22.646
So this was an ambush. Whoever did this

02:22.681 --> 02:24.448
knew that he had that case with him.

02:24.482 --> 02:27.584
Looks like the attackers fled
in a late model g-wagon, no plates.

02:27.619 --> 02:29.186
[Camera shutter clicks]

02:29.220 --> 02:30.521
Is that a boot print on his shirt?

02:30.555 --> 02:32.989
The killer must have held
him down with his foot.

02:33.024 --> 02:34.558
So what was in the case?

02:34.592 --> 02:36.694
Nuclear launch codes? Deadly virus?

02:36.728 --> 02:38.628
We don't know yet. The driver's log shows

02:38.662 --> 02:40.697
that Mr. Gensler was picked
up at Teterboro Airport

02:40.731 --> 02:43.133
after arriving on a private
charter flight from Switzerland.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.667
And where was the car taking him?

02:44.702 --> 02:46.136
The manifest only lists the pickup.

02:46.170 --> 02:48.504
- You call the car company?
- Uh, there's no one to call.

02:48.539 --> 02:50.373
The driver... Renzo Conrad...
owned the service.

02:50.407 --> 02:51.708
He was a one-man band.

02:51.742 --> 02:55.110
Speaking of "one-man band,"
where's your partner?

02:55.145 --> 02:57.947
Yeah! And Lanie.

02:57.981 --> 02:59.349
Lanie: Wait! Wait.

02:59.383 --> 03:00.850
We're here. We were just, uh...

03:00.884 --> 03:02.585
- Stuck in traffic.
- Yeah.

03:02.619 --> 03:04.787
Why don't you bring Romeo here up to speed

03:04.822 --> 03:06.356
and contact the swiss consulate.

03:06.390 --> 03:08.591
Maybe they know what Gensler was up to.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.093
[Camera shutter clicking]

03:11.127 --> 03:14.081
Castle, what are you doing with my body?

03:14.630 --> 03:15.998
Just pretend like you don't know him.

03:16.032 --> 03:17.900
[Scoffs] Beckett, this is not dirt.

03:17.934 --> 03:21.136
It's flint... [Sniffs]
hints of carbon.

03:21.171 --> 03:22.838
That's coal.

03:22.873 --> 03:25.607
- It's pulverized, unrefined coal.
- So?

03:25.641 --> 03:28.810
So I used a clue like this
in one of my early Derrick Storm books.

03:28.845 --> 03:32.113
It's very unusual to find unrefined coal
outside a coal-fired power plant.

03:32.147 --> 03:34.482
All the coal plants in the city are either
shut down or converted.

03:34.502 --> 03:36.217
Right, but some of them are still standing.

03:36.252 --> 03:39.020
There's an abandoned one on Hudson
they're gonna turn into a shopping mall.

03:39.054 --> 03:40.622
Coal dust could have come
from a lot of places.

03:40.656 --> 03:42.491
An abandoned plant would be a perfect place

03:42.525 --> 03:44.759
to launch a strike like this.

03:44.793 --> 03:46.627
Lanie, why don't you get C.S.U. techs

03:46.661 --> 03:48.729
to test the substance
on the victim's shirt?

03:48.764 --> 03:50.698
We gotta go to Teterboro
and look into that flight.

03:50.732 --> 03:52.700
And that coal plant is right on the way.

03:52.734 --> 03:54.302
Fine.

03:54.336 --> 03:57.005
We'll stop off at the coal plant.

04:04.913 --> 04:06.213
So you thinking about going?

04:06.247 --> 04:08.115
Going where?

04:08.149 --> 04:09.583
Sorenson's wedding.

04:09.618 --> 04:11.385
Take a little trip down memory lane.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.387
[Laughs] I don't think
that's such a good idea.

04:13.422 --> 04:14.988
Why not?
[Sighs]

04:15.023 --> 04:18.603
I'm not really ready for
someone else's perfect day.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.099
You know I'd give anything to
change what happened, right?

04:26.134 --> 04:28.201
Yeah, I know you would.

04:30.494 --> 04:32.005
Castle.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.073
You were right.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.775
[Beep] The shooter's gwagon's here.

04:35.810 --> 04:39.612
Espo, hey. I need backup at
the Hudson River coal plant.

04:44.505 --> 04:47.320
Castle: There's the case.

04:49.329 --> 04:50.787
What's in it?

04:52.467 --> 04:54.944
Some kind of artifact.

04:54.964 --> 04:58.062
Must be valuable if it
was worth killing over.

04:58.082 --> 04:59.531
[Alarm buzzing] Castle, what are you...

04:59.566 --> 05:01.968
[gunshots]
Get down!

05:04.737 --> 05:06.839
Why do you always have to touch everything?

05:06.873 --> 05:09.539
I thought you liked that about me.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.144
Move!

05:13.179 --> 05:14.746
[Explosion]

05:18.050 --> 05:19.985
[Grunts]

05:20.019 --> 05:21.086
[Metal clanks]

05:21.120 --> 05:23.238
[Groans]

05:26.025 --> 05:27.825
[Patting]

05:30.929 --> 05:34.565
[Door squeaks]

05:34.600 --> 05:36.567
[Whispers] Beckett?

05:37.836 --> 05:39.570
Beckett?

05:45.268 --> 05:47.284
[Loudly] Beckett?

05:52.684 --> 05:55.219
Beckett?!

05:56.388 --> 05:58.989
Guys. Hey, guys.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.090
Beckett's in trouble.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.126
I got away, but her car is missing.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.416
- I think she was abducted.
- Uh, captain?

06:06.564 --> 06:09.599
You're okay! You made it back.

06:09.634 --> 06:10.901
Captain Beckett,
this guy claims you're in trouble.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.139
- Captain?
- You know him?

06:16.133 --> 06:18.909
I've never seen this man before in my life.

06:23.085 --> 06:25.769

sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:30.106 --> 06:33.101
Never seen me before?
Okay, that's very funny.

06:33.121 --> 06:35.056
I'm just glad you're okay.
How did you get back here?

06:35.076 --> 06:37.592
- Excuse me?
- From the power plant.

06:37.612 --> 06:40.180
We were being shot at.
That's a nice suit, by the way.

06:40.215 --> 06:42.649
Whoever you are, I think you better leave.

06:42.683 --> 06:44.518
- Whoever I am?
- Come on, pal.

06:44.552 --> 06:46.186
Whatever trip you're on,
if you leave quietly,

06:46.221 --> 06:47.454
I'm sure we can forget this ever happened.

06:47.489 --> 06:50.491
Okay! Whoa-ho! I get it.
You guys are punking me.

06:50.525 --> 06:52.792
Sorry. Just like, uh, my birthday.

06:52.827 --> 06:54.560
This is good. How did you stage that?

06:54.595 --> 06:57.664
The double shooting, the severed hand,
coal dust on the shirt?

06:57.698 --> 06:59.499
He just described our crime scene.

06:59.533 --> 07:00.934
Where did you get that information?

07:00.968 --> 07:05.438
From being... at the crime scene with...

07:05.472 --> 07:06.506
all of you.

07:06.540 --> 07:09.776
Captain, we only got the forensics
about the coal dust five minutes ago.

07:09.810 --> 07:12.077
And how do you know so
much about this case?

07:12.112 --> 07:14.980
Kate, okay, you know what?
You got me. Joke's over.

07:15.015 --> 07:16.582
You're right. It is.

07:16.617 --> 07:18.251
Ah!

07:21.488 --> 07:22.821
[Laughs] Guys!

07:22.856 --> 07:24.923
Seriously, what's going on here?

07:24.958 --> 07:27.760
Mr. Richard Castle. Ha, you're a novelist.

07:27.794 --> 07:29.528
Why don't you tell us a story

07:29.562 --> 07:31.429
about where you were
between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m.?

07:31.464 --> 07:33.398
In bed with Beckett.

07:33.432 --> 07:35.300
Maybe you shouldn't talk
about the captain like that.

07:35.334 --> 07:36.769
How did you know about the coal dust?

07:36.803 --> 07:39.237
Well, that's where all this started,
at the plant.

07:39.272 --> 07:41.406
There was...

07:41.440 --> 07:44.342
There was an explosion.

07:44.377 --> 07:46.744
I must have gotten knocked out.
This is a dream.

07:46.779 --> 07:50.114
Okay? [Chuckles] You guys are
just creations of my psyche.

07:50.149 --> 07:51.650
This is me just working out some issues.

07:51.684 --> 07:55.053
That's why you don't know me,
because you aren't real.

07:55.087 --> 07:56.754
And you know what? I can prove it.

07:56.789 --> 07:58.590
- Well-known fact...
- Hey!

07:58.624 --> 08:00.058
It's impossible to read in a dream.

08:00.092 --> 08:04.228
"Richard Castle, a.k.a. Richard Rodgers."

08:04.262 --> 08:05.629
You had me worried there.

08:05.664 --> 08:07.131
For a second, I thought I didn't exist.

08:07.166 --> 08:08.465
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey...

08:08.500 --> 08:10.768
it says here I jumped
on a Macy's parade float

08:10.803 --> 08:12.970
and sang "Let it go" with Idina Menzel

08:13.005 --> 08:14.605
and then landed a hot-air
balloon naked in Central Park?

08:14.639 --> 08:16.140
I didn't do these things, guys.

08:16.175 --> 08:19.109
Come on.
I would never sing "Let it go" as a duet.

08:19.143 --> 08:21.645
Mr. Castle,
this is gonna go much easier for you

08:21.680 --> 08:23.668
if you just tell us what you know
about those murders.

08:23.688 --> 08:25.782
- Okay, Kate? Kate!
- This guy's nuts.

08:25.817 --> 08:27.251
Come on. [Knocking]

08:27.285 --> 08:29.119
Please, just talk to me.

08:29.153 --> 08:30.921
Sit down, or I'll have to restrain you.

08:30.955 --> 08:34.495
I know you're in there,
because usually I'm right beside you.

08:35.977 --> 08:38.227
Mr. Castle, sit down.

08:38.261 --> 08:40.336
[Door closes]

08:41.298 --> 08:42.866
[Whispers] I'll handle this.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.035
- You sure, captain?
- Mm-hmm.

08:46.437 --> 08:48.205
[Door opens]

08:48.239 --> 08:50.340
[Telephone ringing,
indistinct conversations]

08:50.374 --> 08:52.542
Mr. Castle, let's just say for a moment

08:52.576 --> 08:54.210
that you and I did meet each other.

08:54.245 --> 08:55.778
Where would that have been?

08:55.812 --> 08:58.581
At my book party. You came to me.

08:58.616 --> 09:00.617
You asked me to consult
on a copycat murder.

09:00.651 --> 09:02.285
It was six years ago.
Your hair was short then.

09:02.319 --> 09:04.121
It was adorable.

09:06.456 --> 09:08.523
Six years ago, huh?

09:08.558 --> 09:11.794
Well, it says here that you met

09:11.828 --> 09:13.796
with a detective McNulty.

09:13.830 --> 09:16.031
Apparently you helped him solve the case.

09:16.066 --> 09:18.533
No... no, no, no.
Kate, it was... it was you.

09:18.568 --> 09:21.137
All right. Okay, I...
I woke up next to you this morning.

09:21.171 --> 09:22.571
I'm not imagining that.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.973
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Castle.

09:25.007 --> 09:27.643
We don't have a relationship.

09:27.677 --> 09:30.870
Before today, you and I have never met.

09:31.847 --> 09:34.841
Now, is there someone that
you would like to call?

09:36.253 --> 09:37.986
Who should I make this out to?

09:38.020 --> 09:40.155
- Uh, Kevin, Mrs, Rodgers.
- Aha.

09:40.189 --> 09:42.190
All right, Kevin.

09:42.224 --> 09:44.492
Your Mama Rose in "Gypsy"... perfection!

09:44.526 --> 09:48.096
Ah, thank you.
You are a dear, sweet boy. [Chuckles]

09:48.130 --> 09:49.330
You were robbed of that third Tony.

09:49.364 --> 09:51.833
- Oh, well.
- Mother?

09:51.867 --> 09:52.934
- Richard!
- Hmm!

09:52.968 --> 09:54.568
Darling, you look like hell.

09:54.603 --> 09:56.003
Thank God. You know me.

09:56.037 --> 09:58.071
No, no, no. Please. Darling, you're filthy.

09:58.106 --> 09:59.740
You're lucky your mama could
alibi you out for the murder.

09:59.775 --> 10:01.975
Oh, he only kills on paper. [Laughter]

10:02.010 --> 10:03.944
And I'll have you know that coming down

10:03.978 --> 10:06.747
to the police station to get
my grown son out of prison

10:06.782 --> 10:08.148
is the last thing I have time for.

10:08.183 --> 10:10.718
You know full well we open in two days.

10:10.752 --> 10:12.752
- We open what?
- Both: "Mame"!

10:12.787 --> 10:15.022
My revival of "Auntie Mame."

10:15.056 --> 10:18.667
Exactly how hard did you party last night?

10:21.529 --> 10:24.623
Apparently very, very hard.

10:26.534 --> 10:28.135
Oh, that can't be good.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.870
Come on, kiddo. Come on. Oh, dear.

10:34.241 --> 10:35.975
Don't worry, darling.

10:36.009 --> 10:39.101
Once you're home, you'll feel much better.
[Elevator bell dings]

10:39.480 --> 10:40.980
Oh, my God, mother!

10:41.014 --> 10:43.049
What have you done with my place?

10:43.083 --> 10:47.486
Oh, Richard. We have talked about this!

10:47.520 --> 10:50.990
Now that we share the mortgage,
it is our place.

10:51.024 --> 10:54.493
And since you have lost
most of your life savings...

10:54.527 --> 10:56.462
Whoa! Lost my savings? How?

10:56.496 --> 10:58.898
You invested poorly...
mostly blondes and racehorses.

10:58.932 --> 11:01.200
And it's not as if your
great american novel here

11:01.235 --> 11:02.701
is flying off the shelves.

11:02.736 --> 11:06.572
"Finite Laughter"?
I did not write this. This...

11:06.606 --> 11:09.375
"Babcock was a small man,
a small man with large dreams,

11:09.409 --> 11:11.577
and one of those dreams was Betty."
This is awful!

11:11.611 --> 11:13.178
Exactly what the critics said.

11:13.212 --> 11:15.347
But I am pleased to see that distance

11:15.382 --> 11:16.582
has given you some perspective.

11:16.616 --> 11:18.183
- Good.
- Oh, hey, dad.

11:18.217 --> 11:19.517
Hey.

11:19.551 --> 11:20.752
I see you made bail.

11:20.786 --> 11:22.854
Alexis, your hair! When did you do that?!

11:22.889 --> 11:25.690
Uh, three years ago.

11:25.724 --> 11:28.193
- Before I moved to L.A.
- L.A.?!

11:28.227 --> 11:31.729
Richard, don't start.
Alexis is here for a few days.

11:31.764 --> 11:33.498
She's taking time off from saving the world

11:33.532 --> 11:35.366
to come to my opening night.

11:35.401 --> 11:36.667
Okay.

11:36.702 --> 11:37.935
Okay, that's it.

11:37.969 --> 11:39.937
That's it. I'm done.

11:39.971 --> 11:41.338
[Scoffs]

11:41.373 --> 11:42.507
Gram, is he okay?

11:42.541 --> 11:44.174
He had a rough night.

11:44.209 --> 11:45.410
Oh.

11:45.444 --> 11:48.379
Whatever... all this is...

11:48.414 --> 11:51.515
a coma, a dream, some weird hallucination,

11:51.549 --> 11:55.719
or even just a...
undigested bit of pizza...

11:56.788 --> 11:58.802
I'm ending it.

12:02.961 --> 12:05.229
It's time to wake up.

12:05.263 --> 12:08.698
[Blowing bubbles]

12:11.302 --> 12:12.769
[Blowing bubbles]

12:12.804 --> 12:15.104
[Panting]

12:15.139 --> 12:16.473
I don't understand.

12:16.507 --> 12:18.141
I've never had a dream like this before.

12:18.175 --> 12:20.744
- Why aren't I waking up?
- Maybe it's not a dream.

12:20.778 --> 12:22.979
Maybe you traveled into
some alternate universe.

12:23.013 --> 12:24.780
Oh, Alexis, don't tease your father.

12:24.815 --> 12:26.715
Maybe you'd just better lie down.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.251
Yeah, maybe I should.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.127
[Typing]

12:38.162 --> 12:40.863
[Mouthing words]

12:44.935 --> 12:47.837
Hey, Richie.

12:47.871 --> 12:49.638
I used your hidden key like you said.

12:49.673 --> 12:51.474
Who are you?

12:51.508 --> 12:53.175
Oh, is that what we're playing?

12:53.209 --> 12:55.010
- Okay.
- Oh!

12:55.044 --> 12:56.579
I saw you at the bus stop, mister,

12:56.613 --> 12:57.912
and I followed you home.

12:57.947 --> 13:00.349
Okay, obviously we know each other...
Chelsea?

13:00.383 --> 13:02.351
Oh,
it was the funnest two weeks of my life.

13:02.385 --> 13:04.052
Okay, real... I... oh, I...

13:04.087 --> 13:06.588
- I-I really can't do this.
- Sure, you can. Sure, you can.

13:06.622 --> 13:08.190
I got a couple little
blue pills in my purse.

13:08.224 --> 13:10.692
Oh. No... no, I mean...
no, I just... I, uh...

13:10.726 --> 13:12.794
I-I have to get back to work.

13:12.828 --> 13:15.630
Look, you seem like a...
a lovely young...

13:15.664 --> 13:20.368
young woman, but I-I-I,
um, I think you should go.

13:21.637 --> 13:22.871
Seriously?

13:22.905 --> 13:24.105
[Huffs]

13:24.139 --> 13:27.375
You writers are so strange. [Sighs]

13:27.409 --> 13:29.644
[Exhales deeply]

13:38.387 --> 13:41.222
Man: It was like suddenly
I walked through a doorway

13:41.256 --> 13:44.591
where I knew everyone,
but everything was different.

13:44.626 --> 13:48.105
My wife was married to another man.

13:49.697 --> 13:52.533
I came back home,
and my parents didn't recognize me.

13:52.567 --> 13:54.768
They didn't know me.

14:09.501 --> 14:11.768
Well, good morning, darling.

14:11.803 --> 14:13.337
Are you feeling better today?

14:13.371 --> 14:14.771
Much, because I know what's going on.

14:14.806 --> 14:17.374
I know why I'm here. It's this.

14:17.409 --> 14:21.378
"Swiss archaeological team discovers
ancient incan artifact"?

14:21.413 --> 14:24.014
Not just any artifact. Given its markings,

14:24.048 --> 14:26.016
some mystics believe that it's connected

14:26.050 --> 14:27.617
to the incan gateway to the gods,

14:27.651 --> 14:31.321
a doorway through which shamans
were known to travel into other realms.

14:31.355 --> 14:34.124
Dad, I was joking.
Please don't tell me you believe this.

14:34.158 --> 14:36.920
Alexis, I was holding this.

14:38.096 --> 14:42.131
And at right at the moment,
as the grenade was rolling between us,

14:42.165 --> 14:46.218
I was thinking maybe I wasn't good for her.

14:46.653 --> 14:50.240
Maybe Beckett would be
happier if we had never met.

14:50.274 --> 14:52.775
That's what changed. That's where I am...

14:52.809 --> 14:54.176
in a world where we never met.

14:54.211 --> 14:55.911
It's like the last six years didn't happen.

14:55.946 --> 14:56.979
Who... who's Beckett?

14:57.013 --> 14:58.680
Exactly. You don't know who she is,

14:58.715 --> 15:01.117
because she and I never met,
so I didn't write "Nikki Heat,"

15:01.151 --> 15:03.585
I wrote that godawful
piece of trash instead,

15:03.620 --> 15:05.221
and with less money coming in,

15:05.255 --> 15:07.223
you were forced to go
out and be successful.

15:07.257 --> 15:09.658
I found success because
of my boundless talent.

15:09.692 --> 15:11.761
And somehow we drifted apart. Somehow?

15:11.795 --> 15:13.595
I'm not crazy. This is not my world.

15:13.630 --> 15:16.665
I need to get back home.
How do you intend to do that?

15:16.699 --> 15:19.568
By helping this world's
Beckett find that artifact

15:19.602 --> 15:21.603
so I can get back to my reality.

15:21.638 --> 15:24.205
This is why I live with mom. [Door opens]

15:24.240 --> 15:25.774
[Door opens]

15:25.808 --> 15:27.809
So you're a fan.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.611
And here I thought you didn't know me.

15:29.646 --> 15:31.846
Yeah, I don't. I mean, I didn't. I...

15:31.881 --> 15:33.915
Didn't recognize me in my deranged state?

15:33.949 --> 15:37.118
Listen... [laughs] I have to apologize.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.487
How I acted,
you must have thought I was crazy.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.722
Well, yeah, that's because you were.

15:41.757 --> 15:44.492
Yeah.
It's this new book I've been working on.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.795
I have been working nonstop.

15:46.829 --> 15:48.296
I mean, I have been drinking coffee,

15:48.330 --> 15:50.164
popping Nodoz, I haven't slept in days,

15:50.198 --> 15:52.032
and to make matters worse...
[Breathes sharply]

15:52.066 --> 15:55.068
There's a new character.
I-I kind of based her on you.

15:55.103 --> 15:56.904
What I... what I read about you.

15:56.938 --> 16:00.574
So she's savvy and smart and driven,

16:00.609 --> 16:02.543
and I have fallen in love with her.

16:02.577 --> 16:04.444
I mean, I eat with her, I sleep with her...

16:04.478 --> 16:06.613
but I know you are not her.

16:06.647 --> 16:08.282
You know, none of this explains

16:08.316 --> 16:11.232
how you know so much about the crime scene.

16:11.252 --> 16:12.719
I have a police scanner,

16:12.753 --> 16:14.421
and I was tracking the investigation.

16:14.455 --> 16:16.323
Actually, that's why I'm here, captain.

16:16.357 --> 16:18.625
I know what was in the briefcase,

16:18.659 --> 16:20.327
I know where it's going,

16:20.361 --> 16:22.329
- and I think I know who took it.
- And how do you know all that?

16:22.363 --> 16:24.798
It's complicated, but... I do.

16:24.832 --> 16:27.200
[Knock on door] Hey, captain.

16:27.234 --> 16:28.635
What's he doing here?

16:28.669 --> 16:31.070
I'm not sure. [Inhales]

16:31.104 --> 16:33.707
Okay. So, uh,
I heard back from the courier company.

16:33.741 --> 16:35.408
Turns out our victim was transporting...

16:35.443 --> 16:37.886
An ancient incan artifact.

16:38.712 --> 16:40.679
Yeah. And, uh, it was on its way...

16:40.714 --> 16:44.016
To the Lamont-Doherty Laboratories
in Palisades, New York, for study.

16:44.051 --> 16:46.485
Scientists believe it was
fashioned from a meteorite,

16:46.519 --> 16:49.322
but it's proven impenetrable
to conventional scans.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.923
How did I know all this?

16:50.958 --> 16:54.593
I used to be a crime novelist,
and I still have a few sources.

16:54.627 --> 16:59.097
Captain,
this is what your victims were killed for.

16:59.131 --> 17:01.834
And why would someone kill for this?

17:01.868 --> 17:04.435
Well, the folks at the lab
said an object like that

17:04.471 --> 17:07.005
would be invaluable to any collector.

17:07.039 --> 17:10.342
Mr. Castle,
you said that you might know who took it.

17:10.376 --> 17:12.743
Not exactly who, but...

17:12.778 --> 17:15.512
I know who was involved.

17:15.547 --> 17:18.750
So the car service was
going to pick up Gensler,

17:18.784 --> 17:20.685
the courier, from the airport here,

17:20.719 --> 17:24.388
take him to the lab here...
basically north.

17:24.423 --> 17:26.090
Yet for some reason,
when they were attacked,

17:26.125 --> 17:28.659
they ended up here in Spanish Harlem.
The opposite way.

17:29.828 --> 17:31.729
Yes. So either this driver

17:31.764 --> 17:33.230
had a terrible sense of direction...

17:33.265 --> 17:34.499
Or he was in on it.

17:34.533 --> 17:37.482
And maybe his partners
killed him to silence him.

17:38.737 --> 17:42.172
Detective Ryan, get me everything you can
on that driver.

17:45.110 --> 17:47.311
That was surprisingly helpful, Mr. Castle.

17:47.345 --> 17:49.213
Do you mind if I... hang around,

17:49.247 --> 17:51.481
- see how this turns out?
- Mm-hmm. Breakroom's over there.

17:51.516 --> 17:52.516
I know.

17:59.824 --> 18:01.825
[Sniffs]

18:01.859 --> 18:03.159
[Pours coffee]

18:03.193 --> 18:04.895
Yo, writer boy, tell me how you know

18:04.929 --> 18:07.163
- about that coal plant.
- What?

18:07.197 --> 18:09.999
The one you were talking about
when you came in yesterday.

18:10.034 --> 18:11.868
Captain had me check it out.

18:11.903 --> 18:13.570
You know what I found?

18:14.872 --> 18:16.339
Tire tracks.

18:16.373 --> 18:19.375
The same tire tracks that
we found at our crime scene.

18:19.410 --> 18:21.277
Now, you knew that our doers were using it

18:21.312 --> 18:22.878
as a staging ground, and the only way

18:22.913 --> 18:24.680
you would know that is
if you were involved.

18:24.714 --> 18:28.217
Okay, fine.
I don't usually like to tell people this,

18:28.252 --> 18:30.753
but I have a gift.

18:30.787 --> 18:32.388
I know things. You know things?

18:32.423 --> 18:34.757
You and I haven't met before yesterday,
correct?

18:34.791 --> 18:36.391
- Yeah.
- So then how would I know

18:36.426 --> 18:37.993
that you had a thing with a woman

18:38.027 --> 18:40.529
whose initials were... L.P.?

18:40.564 --> 18:43.365
And how would I know that
she moved on and you can't?

18:43.399 --> 18:47.636
Ryan has a big, fat mouth.
That's how you know.

18:47.671 --> 18:49.671
What happened? Commitment issues?

18:50.773 --> 18:53.275
[Door opens]

18:53.309 --> 18:55.477
Hey, man. We got something.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.047
[Mouths word]

18:59.082 --> 19:02.484
Okay, so over the last four
days before he was killed,

19:02.518 --> 19:04.252
our driver made a...

19:10.295 --> 19:12.760
Our driver made a series of phone calls

19:12.795 --> 19:15.663
to a pay phone located
inside of a restaurant.

19:15.698 --> 19:17.331
The only problem is,
the place has been shut down

19:17.366 --> 19:18.867
- the past couple of months.
- Who was he calling?

19:18.901 --> 19:20.334
I have no idea, but check it out...

19:20.369 --> 19:21.603
The deserted restaurant, El Chozo,

19:21.637 --> 19:22.803
maybe that's where he was headed.

19:22.837 --> 19:24.571
It's right near where
the S.U.V. was attacked.

19:24.606 --> 19:27.074
All right, get up there.
See what you can find.

19:27.109 --> 19:30.277
Uh, captain,
would it be possible for me to ride along?

19:30.312 --> 19:33.280
- Uh, strictly for research purposes.
- Is he kidding?

19:33.315 --> 19:34.982
I would just love the chance to observe,

19:35.017 --> 19:37.485
- get some details for my book.
- Yeah, sure, cap, we'll take him along.

19:37.519 --> 19:39.419
- What the...
- Dude, that's Martha Rodgers' son.

19:39.453 --> 19:40.954
He can get us house seats.

19:40.989 --> 19:43.289
- You can get us house seats, right?
- Ab... solutely.

19:43.324 --> 19:45.458
Okay.
But do as they say and don't interfere.

19:45.493 --> 19:47.761
Come on. Let's go, house seats.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.362
So the captain...

19:49.397 --> 19:51.231
[sighs] Is she seeing anyone?

19:51.265 --> 19:53.433
She has boyfriends. Nothing serious.

19:53.467 --> 19:54.902
Why, writer boy?

19:54.936 --> 19:56.503
What, you think you have a chance with her?

19:56.537 --> 19:58.671
And what are you doing,

19:58.705 --> 20:00.440
telling crazy over here about
everyone's private life?

20:00.474 --> 20:02.142
- Me?
- Yeah.

20:02.176 --> 20:03.676
- You told him about Lanie and me.
- No...

20:03.710 --> 20:04.844
- No.
- No, no, no, I didn't!

20:04.878 --> 20:07.480
I'm telling you...
I have a gift, all right?

20:07.515 --> 20:09.649
I look at people, and I see things.

20:09.683 --> 20:11.084
[Laughs] Yeah, okay.

20:11.118 --> 20:13.619
Uh, what do you see when you look at me?

20:13.654 --> 20:16.022
Honeymilk and freckles.

20:16.056 --> 20:17.990
No!

20:18.025 --> 20:19.124
That's Jenny O'Malley.

20:19.159 --> 20:22.327
Yeah, she used to, um, make me honeymilk.

20:22.362 --> 20:23.829
She could have been the one.

20:23.864 --> 20:25.831
- Could have?
- Yeah, um...

20:25.866 --> 20:27.733
Well, when Beckett was promoted to captain,

20:27.768 --> 20:29.134
our caseload doubled.

20:29.169 --> 20:32.771
I guess I-I never had time for her.

20:32.805 --> 20:34.739
Maybe you should give her a call.

20:34.774 --> 20:37.042
Maybe you should mind your own business.

20:37.077 --> 20:38.077
Oh!

20:41.181 --> 20:44.983
[Engine turns off] All right.
Here are the rules...

20:45.017 --> 20:48.119
stay in the car, or I shoot you. Got it?

20:48.153 --> 20:49.821
You want to crack a window for me?

20:49.855 --> 20:50.889
Ha.

20:52.157 --> 20:54.292
[Sighs]

20:54.326 --> 20:56.157
[Door closes]

20:58.898 --> 21:01.399
I can't believe the captain's
making us babysit this nutjob.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.525
Ah, he's not so bad.

21:34.398 --> 21:37.133
Oh, yes.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.068
Okay...

21:39.103 --> 21:41.170
Take me home.

21:47.344 --> 21:48.711
Come on...

21:48.746 --> 21:51.413
[Blade zings] Hand it over, or you die.

21:54.864 --> 21:56.464
Who sent you? What do you know?

21:56.499 --> 21:59.394
Nobody sent me. Nobody... uh,
it just... this... it sent me.

21:59.414 --> 22:02.900
The object, it sent me.
I saw a, uh, a blue light,

22:02.920 --> 22:04.285
and I ended up here.

22:04.305 --> 22:06.206
N.Y.P.D.! Drop your knife now!

22:06.240 --> 22:08.808
[Clattering, shatters] No!

22:11.612 --> 22:12.612
[Sighs]

22:14.415 --> 22:15.415
What the hell, man?

22:15.449 --> 22:16.916
You were supposed to wait in the car.

22:16.950 --> 22:19.151
What does it matter now? It's broken!

22:19.186 --> 22:21.020
Now I'm never getting home.

22:21.054 --> 22:23.555
Now I'm stuck here in this life.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.760
But the real one would never... break.

22:27.794 --> 22:30.696
This is a fake! This is a fake.

22:30.731 --> 22:32.431
Where did you get this,
and where's the real one?

22:32.465 --> 22:34.499
Cuff him, too. [Mouths word]

22:34.534 --> 22:36.167
[Sighs]

22:36.202 --> 22:39.304
What the hell do you think you were doing?

22:39.339 --> 22:40.939
You could have gotten yourself killed.

22:40.973 --> 22:43.842
I had backup.
And I did help capture a suspect.

22:43.876 --> 22:45.944
No, you were supposed to
accompany and observe,

22:45.978 --> 22:47.579
- not participate and...
- Annoy.

22:47.614 --> 22:49.281
Risk my people's lives.

22:49.315 --> 22:50.615
Now, after this morning's antics,

22:50.649 --> 22:52.516
I expected you to be on your best behavior.

22:52.551 --> 22:54.346
Actually, that kind of is my best behavior.

22:54.366 --> 22:57.418
- What?
- Oh, I'm just enjoying the show.

22:58.057 --> 23:00.625
Our suspect's name is Maria Sanchez.

23:00.659 --> 23:02.127
She's wanted by the peruvian government

23:02.161 --> 23:04.062
in connection with the bombings
at a government building,

23:04.096 --> 23:06.030
not to mention the theft and trafficking

23:06.065 --> 23:07.798
of stolen artifacts.

23:07.832 --> 23:09.567
Then that's her, and she's behind it.

23:09.601 --> 23:12.737
- We need to talk to her.
- No, Mr. Castle, they need to talk to her.

23:12.771 --> 23:14.605
You need to go home.
You're done with this case.

23:14.625 --> 23:15.200
But...

23:15.220 --> 23:17.174
You're lucky I don't
arrest you for obstruction.

23:17.208 --> 23:19.943
Officer,
please escort Mr. Castle to the elevator.

23:19.978 --> 23:21.812
- I want him gone.
- You don't understand.

23:21.846 --> 23:23.914
I need to find this artifact.

23:23.948 --> 23:26.416
Beckett! Please!

23:32.056 --> 23:34.057
Yes, Detective Esposito?

23:34.092 --> 23:35.759
You're not letting him get to him, are you?

23:35.794 --> 23:37.494
Don't you have a case to close?
[Elevator bell dings]

23:37.528 --> 23:39.308
Mm-hmm.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.387
Maria: You call it smuggling.

24:18.407 --> 24:21.447
We call it taking back our rightful legacy.

24:21.467 --> 24:24.506
That artifact was considered
divine by our shamans

24:24.541 --> 24:26.008
and belongs to the incan people.

24:26.043 --> 24:28.277
Was that legacy worth the lives of two men?

24:28.312 --> 24:31.747
- No, that wasn't the plan.
- Then what was the plan, Maria?

24:31.781 --> 24:33.649
Come on. Just ask where the artifact is.

24:33.683 --> 24:37.319
My cousin Renzo... he was the driver.

24:38.016 --> 24:40.656
He put sedatives in the courier's water
to knock him out.

24:40.690 --> 24:42.939
Once Gensler was asleep, we were going to

24:42.959 --> 24:45.227
bring him to the restaurant
and switch the cases.

24:45.261 --> 24:46.728
No one was supposed to get hurt.

24:46.762 --> 24:49.564
But someone attacked them.
Someone else took it.

24:49.598 --> 24:51.432
You don't know where it is?

24:51.467 --> 24:53.368
That attack happened just a
few blocks from the restaurant.

24:53.402 --> 24:55.436
How did they know the
car was gonna be there?

24:55.471 --> 24:57.204
Who else was involved, Maria?

24:57.239 --> 24:59.607
Who else besides you and Renzo

24:59.641 --> 25:01.576
knew about the change in route?

25:01.610 --> 25:03.643
No one.
[Sighs]

25:03.678 --> 25:06.468
Except the guy at the airport.

25:07.051 --> 25:08.182
- What guy?
- What guy?

25:08.216 --> 25:10.717
The plan only worked if
Renzo made the pickup.

25:10.752 --> 25:13.520
But the courier, Gensler,
was using another car service.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.090
So we paid the concierge
at the private jet terminal

25:16.124 --> 25:17.791
to change limo companies.

25:17.825 --> 25:19.025
Maybe he told someone.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.360
Or maybe he knows where the artifact is.

25:20.395 --> 25:21.595
Just ask her his name.

25:21.629 --> 25:23.296
Esposito: Do you remember his name?

25:23.330 --> 25:25.365
Mr. Castle!

25:25.400 --> 25:29.168
Hey! I was... I just, um...

25:32.125 --> 25:33.006
[Cell door slams]

25:33.040 --> 25:34.541
I can't believe she locked me up.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.342
She... she has no idea

25:36.377 --> 25:38.311
she's stopping me from getting back to her.

25:38.345 --> 25:39.612
I don't know, man.

25:39.646 --> 25:41.547
Maybe this is your real life.

25:41.581 --> 25:42.882
'Cause the one where you're rich and famous

25:42.917 --> 25:45.919
and engaged to the hot cop
sounds pretty made-up to me.

25:45.953 --> 25:47.553
Beckett: I called your mother.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.989
She refused to come and get you.

25:50.024 --> 25:52.625
Oh. Well,
she always did believe in tough love.

25:52.659 --> 25:54.393
That doesn't seem to have
worked out in your case.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.361
No.

25:56.396 --> 25:59.264
What is it with you and this case,
Mr. Castle?

25:59.299 --> 26:00.866
I'm a mystery writer and I'm compelled

26:00.901 --> 26:02.167
to know how the story ends.

26:02.201 --> 26:03.736
With you... [Door buzzes]

26:05.305 --> 26:06.839
Going home.

26:06.873 --> 26:08.140
You're letting me go?

26:08.174 --> 26:09.641
Well, I could let you stay overnight,

26:09.675 --> 26:11.376
but then I would have to do the paperwork.

26:11.411 --> 26:15.080
No, no. I, uh... [Door buzzes]

26:15.114 --> 26:16.982
[Clank]

26:17.016 --> 26:20.218
You know, you were right.
We have met before.

26:20.253 --> 26:23.155
We have? On a book tour for
an old Derrick Storm novel.

26:23.189 --> 26:27.459
I, uh, waited in line to get it signed...
by you.

26:27.493 --> 26:29.727
I used to love those books.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.062
You never told me that.

26:31.096 --> 26:33.798
Well,
we've only known each other for a day.

26:33.833 --> 26:36.133
Although it feels a lot longer.

26:36.168 --> 26:37.969
I have that effect on people.

26:40.186 --> 26:42.639
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

26:42.674 --> 26:44.442
Anything.

26:44.476 --> 26:47.345
Why did you kill off Derrick Storm?

26:47.379 --> 26:49.080
Esposito: Hey, cap.

26:49.114 --> 26:50.647
We've got something.

26:50.682 --> 26:52.950
[Clicks tongue] Another time, I guess.

26:52.985 --> 26:54.518
Good night, Mr. Castle.

26:59.776 --> 27:01.558
So we talked to the
concierge at the airport.

27:01.593 --> 27:03.360
He admitted to taking a bribe from Maria

27:03.394 --> 27:05.729
to switch limo companies,
but he swore he didn't tell anyone.

27:05.763 --> 27:07.430
But when we held his feet to the fire,

27:07.465 --> 27:09.466
he came clean about what he saw that night.

27:09.501 --> 27:12.102
A black g-wagon sitting
outside the airport gates

27:12.136 --> 27:14.004
- with two guys in it.
- Our shooters.

27:14.038 --> 27:16.439
So they must have been waiting for Gensler,

27:16.474 --> 27:18.108
and then they followed
him from the airport.

27:18.142 --> 27:19.476
Yeah, and while they were waiting,

27:19.510 --> 27:21.111
one of them stepped out for a smoke.

27:21.145 --> 27:22.379
Surveillance caught him on camera.

27:22.413 --> 27:24.614
We issued a B.O.L.O.,
and we're gonna run the tattoo

27:24.648 --> 27:26.016
through the database in the morning.

27:26.050 --> 27:27.950
All right.
Why don't you gentlemen keep me apprised?

27:27.985 --> 27:29.585
Yeah.

27:29.620 --> 27:30.786
[Clack]

27:41.830 --> 27:43.547
[Knocks]

27:43.567 --> 27:44.167
[Whispers] Hi.

27:44.187 --> 27:45.868
I thought we agreed that you were leaving.

27:45.903 --> 27:47.369
Well, I had a thought about the case.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.603
You're not on the case.

27:48.638 --> 27:50.705
Actually, I was thinking about you.

27:50.740 --> 27:52.307
I was wondering if I could buy you a drink.

27:52.342 --> 27:54.709
It's the least I could do.
I owe you that much.

27:54.744 --> 27:56.378
Right. Well,
I don't think that that would be a good...

27:56.413 --> 28:01.050
And if you come,
I will tell you why I killed Derrick Storm.

28:03.353 --> 28:04.886
[Rock music playing]

28:04.921 --> 28:07.689
So,
the youngest woman to ever make captain.

28:07.723 --> 28:09.557
That's impressive.

28:09.591 --> 28:12.225
- It's not all that it's cracked up to be.
- No?

28:12.260 --> 28:14.862
No, and if you really are
basing a character on me,

28:14.896 --> 28:16.396
then she's gonna be boring.

28:16.431 --> 28:18.398
Oh, I doubt you could ever be boring.

28:18.433 --> 28:23.370
Well, my life mostly consists
of paperwork and politics.

28:23.404 --> 28:25.606
Ah, you miss the streets.

28:25.640 --> 28:28.007
Um...

28:28.042 --> 28:29.709
Truthfully, I-I don't think

28:29.743 --> 28:32.518
that I was meant to be
a homicide detective.

28:32.953 --> 28:34.323
Why would you say that?

28:34.343 --> 28:36.450
Because the case that
made me want to be a cop,

28:36.484 --> 28:39.154
I was never able to solve.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.167
Anyway, back to you.

28:43.187 --> 28:45.656
Why did you kill off Derrick Storm?

28:45.830 --> 28:48.094
Ah. It's complicated.

28:48.128 --> 28:50.496
Wait. What is this place?

28:50.530 --> 28:53.032
- I thought this was a date.
- Okay, hang on. Hear me out.

28:53.067 --> 28:55.001
You're still working the case.

28:55.035 --> 28:57.070
Listen. The crimson rhino is the mascot

28:57.104 --> 28:58.638
for an australian rugby team.

28:58.672 --> 29:01.107
If our suspect has a tattoo on his neck,

29:01.141 --> 29:02.941
he's got to be a major fan. I looked it up.

29:02.976 --> 29:04.510
There's only one bar in New York

29:04.544 --> 29:06.479
that plays their games live.

29:06.513 --> 29:07.879
And there's one on right now.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.381
I knew this was a mistake.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.950
Beckett, wait.

29:14.554 --> 29:16.021
It's him.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.522
Stay here.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.261
Excuse me.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.530
N.Y.P.D. Step away from the bar

29:25.564 --> 29:28.053
and put your hands where I can see them.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.736
Sure thing. [Chuckles]

29:30.770 --> 29:31.837
Hey!

29:31.871 --> 29:33.771
Uhh! [Thud]

29:33.805 --> 29:35.906
[Handcuffs clicking]

29:35.941 --> 29:38.143
We make a pretty good team, you and I.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.639
[Exhales sharply]

29:48.852 --> 29:50.372
Well? What'd he say?

29:50.392 --> 29:54.157
Nothing,
on the advice of his high-powered counsel.

29:54.177 --> 29:54.977
[Telephone ringing in distance]

29:54.997 --> 29:57.726
- Okay, so what's our next move?
- There is no next move.

29:57.761 --> 30:00.062
You asked to stick around
until this case was resolved.

30:00.096 --> 30:01.797
- It's resolved.
- How is it resolved?

30:01.831 --> 30:04.233
Detectives Ryan and
Esposito found the g-wagon

30:04.268 --> 30:06.401
and the murder weapons
at our suspect's place.

30:06.435 --> 30:07.770
This is open-and-shut.

30:07.804 --> 30:09.604
What about the artifact?
We need to find it.

30:09.639 --> 30:10.873
Whoever had them steal it,

30:10.907 --> 30:13.308
it and they are long gone by now.

30:13.342 --> 30:15.044
Someone has to know where it is.

30:15.078 --> 30:16.578
There's the other shooter.

30:16.612 --> 30:18.613
Okay, but we have no way to find them.

30:18.648 --> 30:22.317
Look, the D.A.'s gonna ask for a plea deal.

30:22.351 --> 30:24.919
But trust me, this suspect's ex-military.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.921
- He's not gonna roll.
- So that's it?

30:26.955 --> 30:28.923
This isn't one of your books, Mr. Castle.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.625
You don't always get the answers.

30:30.660 --> 30:33.127
We cleared the case. It's a win.
