00:02.931 --> 00:04.977
<i>I can't believe
today is my last day</i>

00:05.012 --> 00:05.877
<i>at Sacred Heart.</i>

00:06.601 --> 00:08.575
<i>I couldn't help
but let my mind drift back</i>

00:08.610 --> 00:09.807
<i>to my very
first day.</i>

00:10.200 --> 00:11.862
Don't look at me
when we are moving someone.

00:11.897 --> 00:12.412
Why?

00:13.984 --> 00:15.156
<i>And from now on,</i>

00:15.419 --> 00:16.737
whenever I am
in the room,

00:16.814 --> 00:18.431
you're definitely
not allowed to talk.

00:20.920 --> 00:21.699
Charge!

00:27.292 --> 00:28.612
Doctor Dorian...

00:29.157 --> 00:31.688
Do you <i>not</i> realize
that you're nothing

00:31.723 --> 00:34.705
but a large pair of scrubs
to me?

00:35.501 --> 00:36.540
Sticked a penny
in there?

00:36.575 --> 00:37.702
No, I was just making
small talk...

00:37.919 --> 00:41.360
If I'll find a penny in there,
I'm taking you down.

00:42.764 --> 00:44.202
I thought we cared
about each other?

00:44.402 --> 00:46.190
Oh please, if you don't want
to sleep with me,

00:46.225 --> 00:47.037
you'd do
the same thing.

00:47.072 --> 00:48.096
I'd tell you one thing,
the last thing in the world

00:48.131 --> 00:49.425
I want to do
is sleep with you now!

00:51.602 --> 00:52.702
Do me right here...

00:53.382 --> 00:54.172
Okay.

00:54.207 --> 00:54.502
See?

00:57.219 --> 00:59.719
<i>I won in the end though,
because now she loves me</i>

00:59.754 --> 01:01.810
<i>and I get to have her
whenever I see fit.</i>

01:02.103 --> 01:04.641
<i>In fact, I think
I'll use this last day thing</i>

01:04.676 --> 01:06.337
<i>to score
some morning sex...</i>

01:06.403 --> 01:08.816
I can't believe
today's my last day...

01:08.851 --> 01:09.733
No morning sex.

01:09.768 --> 01:10.561
Worth a try.

01:12.103 --> 01:14.928
We can kiss if you remember
to lay out mouth wash last night.

01:15.157 --> 01:15.851
I did.

01:17.030 --> 01:18.882
Did you water it down
so we can just swallow it?

01:18.917 --> 01:19.830
Of course,
I did!

01:19.865 --> 01:22.559
<i>Actually, I did not remembered
to water it down.</i>

01:22.594 --> 01:23.351
<i>At all.</i>

01:27.104 --> 01:28.604
- Morning.
- You weirdo.

01:30.204 --> 01:32.632
You'd love it.
How'd you sleep?

01:32.667 --> 01:34.024
Really well
actually...

01:34.059 --> 01:35.469
I know that
you wanna know why.

01:35.504 --> 01:36.620
This is my bed!

01:36.655 --> 01:38.328
I had it brought here
because it's so comfortable!

01:38.704 --> 01:40.310
You don't have a bed
at your house anymore?

01:40.345 --> 01:42.638
Why bother, I've slept here
like every night since you moved.

01:42.704 --> 01:44.935
So...
We live together?

01:45.331 --> 01:46.846
Kinda.
I guess.

01:46.881 --> 01:48.453
I feel like
I should've been told.

01:49.858 --> 01:50.678
Come on.

01:50.705 --> 01:51.908
<i>I see it now.</i>

01:52.125 --> 01:55.089
You've been sneak-moving
in here for days!

01:55.237 --> 01:56.857
<i>The clothes
in the dresser,</i>

01:56.892 --> 01:59.295
those girly pillows
on the couch,

01:59.330 --> 02:02.797
this weird picture
of Vegas Showgirl...

02:03.005 --> 02:04.661
Don't make fun
of my brother Berry.

02:04.896 --> 02:06.354
And he looks
very beautiful.

02:06.389 --> 02:08.572
They did a dynamite job
on his boobs.

02:08.607 --> 02:09.786
Are those G's?

02:09.854 --> 02:10.803
Double D's.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.308
Plus you are the guy
who keeps asking me

02:12.343 --> 02:13.593
to bring stuff
over here.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.432
Are you seriously upset?

02:16.510 --> 02:17.287
I am very upset,

02:17.322 --> 02:19.469
I don't even think
morning sex could fix it.

02:20.506 --> 02:21.306
Although,
it might.

02:21.506 --> 02:22.106
Fine!

02:23.706 --> 02:24.920
Do we have
to move a lot?

02:24.955 --> 02:26.307
We never do
anyway.

02:26.406 --> 02:27.206
True.

02:33.807 --> 02:35.800
Aw, man...

02:36.318 --> 02:37.786
He got
my coffee wrong.

02:38.107 --> 02:38.988
How?

02:39.307 --> 02:40.188
It's dirt.

02:40.507 --> 02:42.718
That may be
because I told Donnie

02:42.753 --> 02:44.825
you thought
his coffee tasted like dirt.

02:44.907 --> 02:46.127
Why would you
do that?

02:46.162 --> 02:47.841
Because Donnie is
a vengeful, little punk,

02:47.876 --> 02:49.396
and I wondered to see
what he would do.

02:49.907 --> 02:52.519
He's a convicted felony.
Shift the guy!

02:52.707 --> 02:55.624
Aah, I love you Donnie.
Muffin, please!

02:56.192 --> 02:57.897
I still can't believe
you're going back to work.

02:58.091 --> 02:59.242
I miss doctoring.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.657
Any great thing
about locum tenens

03:01.708 --> 03:02.842
is it's part time

03:02.877 --> 03:04.342
and you have to go
where they need you,

03:04.377 --> 03:06.300
so it's gonna force
Enid and me to travel.

03:06.579 --> 03:08.777
Finally, you are gonna stop
hanging around here?

03:08.812 --> 03:09.291
<i>Yep.</i>

03:09.337 --> 03:11.548
This is my last muffin
in this place.

03:11.855 --> 03:14.165
Finally, you're gonna stop
hanging around here?

03:14.208 --> 03:15.388
<i>Uhh, look...</i>

03:15.423 --> 03:16.806
He's stuck
on a thought.

03:16.838 --> 03:18.397
If he doesn't get off
within a few minutes,

03:18.422 --> 03:20.332
just kick him,
that's what I always do.

03:20.531 --> 03:21.337
Okay...

03:23.801 --> 03:26.929
I have enjoyed this
stupid coffee spot so much.

03:27.060 --> 03:28.381
I need a momento.

03:28.803 --> 03:31.794
Would you distract the staff
while I steal my favourite table?

03:31.829 --> 03:33.175
I don't think so,
Bob.

03:33.309 --> 03:34.739
Understood,
it's not your fight.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.725
Finally, you're gonna stop
hanging around--

03:38.019 --> 03:39.221
Finally,
you're gonna stop--

03:39.605 --> 03:40.485
Finally,
you're gonna--

03:40.520 --> 03:42.266
Oh!
Thank you.

03:42.301 --> 03:43.273
No problem.

03:47.614 --> 03:48.698
I wouldn't do that.

03:50.992 --> 03:52.021
It's a good dirt.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.955
So I actually did
drift off a bit.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.553
How was
the morning sex?

04:01.588 --> 04:03.313
I was
awesome!

04:03.511 --> 04:04.198
Really?

04:04.411 --> 04:05.958
Nah, I never really got
things going,

04:05.998 --> 04:07.304
my peep is sleepy.

04:07.996 --> 04:08.732
Hey.

04:08.984 --> 04:11.183
JD, I know that
it's your last day,

04:11.240 --> 04:12.988
but I'm not gonna say,
"Goodbye"

04:13.023 --> 04:15.311
because even if just
saying the word

04:15.346 --> 04:16.957
this ain't gonna go,
it's gonna make me cry.

04:17.988 --> 04:20.610
Okay, okay, take deep breaths,
deep breaths...

04:20.644 --> 04:21.430
I can't catch
my breath,

04:21.432 --> 04:22.794
I can't catch it,
I can't catch it.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.636
Where is it?
Where is it?

04:25.637 --> 04:27.737
Breathe it out,
breathe it out.

04:29.456 --> 04:30.493
Okay,
I'm back.

04:30.712 --> 04:33.315
Plus, I'm just gonna see you
at our place tonight, okay?

04:33.412 --> 04:37.563
Did you just said "our place"?
You <i>are</i> sneak-moving in!

04:37.612 --> 04:38.873
Your ears
are playing tricks.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.584
And JD,
people should make a big deal

04:40.619 --> 04:41.764
about you leaving
Sacred Heart,

04:41.765 --> 04:43.184
but...
don't get disappointed

04:43.205 --> 04:44.643
if it doesn't live up
to expectations

04:44.678 --> 04:45.806
you have
in your head, okay?

04:48.431 --> 04:49.926
I think
I'll be fine.

04:51.713 --> 04:53.399
Yeah, I-uh, I know
it's blocking the stairs,

04:53.434 --> 04:54.568
but people
could walk around, right?

04:54.713 --> 04:55.928
You're the greatest.

04:56.264 --> 04:58.529
Get over here.
You're my bear!

04:58.664 --> 04:59.530
That's right.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.018
Growl for me!

05:02.913 --> 05:04.258
What are
those pads for?

05:04.413 --> 05:07.934
Those pads there, my friend,
are for you to fall on.

05:07.969 --> 05:09.311
In honor
of your departure,

05:09.579 --> 05:11.581
I'm about to give you
your final,

05:11.847 --> 05:14.392
full-turbo,
spinning eagle.

05:15.845 --> 05:16.726
Prepping for takeoff!

05:16.753 --> 05:17.896
Excellent,
now did you get my text

05:17.931 --> 05:19.714
about not eating after midnight,
last night?

05:19.749 --> 05:20.989
All I had is
mouthwash.

05:21.024 --> 05:22.353
Let's do this,
come on!

05:22.388 --> 05:23.117
Mounting.

05:24.814 --> 05:25.386
Three!

05:25.633 --> 05:27.144
<i>Two!
One!</i>

05:27.214 --> 05:30.196
Eagle...
Eagle...

05:30.714 --> 05:32.631
Are these two
doctors?

05:32.914 --> 05:33.977
I'm afraid so.

05:34.215 --> 05:36.697
Never... stop...
spinning me!

05:36.732 --> 05:41.296
Eagle!
Whoo!

05:43.417 --> 05:44.844
Find the pads!

05:44.879 --> 05:46.422
<i>I can't find it.</i>

05:47.662 --> 05:49.929
Dude,
follow my voice!

05:50.250 --> 05:51.354
Coming...

05:55.776 --> 05:58.578
There is another hospital
down about 3 miles that way.

06:00.816 --> 06:01.599
You okay,
babe?

06:01.634 --> 06:02.850
<i>Eagle...</i>

06:03.416 --> 06:04.616
Yeah.

My Finale

06:18.162 --> 06:19.939
Fantastic eagle,
buddy!

06:19.974 --> 06:21.582
Yeah, I really felt
like we nailed it.

06:21.617 --> 06:23.036
So, I'm gonna see you
all day,

06:23.071 --> 06:25.027
I'm worried you did
your goodbye too early.

06:25.127 --> 06:26.895
Oh my God,
I did, I'm such an idiot.

06:26.964 --> 06:28.117
It's all right,
I can fix this,

06:28.152 --> 06:31.004
We just have to match
that initial goodbye intensity

06:31.039 --> 06:32.438
every time
we see each other.

06:32.473 --> 06:33.552
Can you do that
for me?

06:33.617 --> 06:35.031
Yeah, I'll just answer you
like this,

06:35.262 --> 06:36.680
"Come here, you!"

06:38.569 --> 06:39.980
Smell like
a weightlifter.

06:40.217 --> 06:41.798
That's cause I worked out
this morning.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.129
Wow...

06:43.561 --> 06:44.409
It's alright.

06:44.514 --> 06:45.845
I finally dealt
with the fact

06:45.880 --> 06:47.084
that you'll never hold me
like that.

06:47.342 --> 06:49.098
Maybe we should try,
let's see what we're missing.

06:49.099 --> 06:49.570
Yeah?

06:50.499 --> 06:53.125
Oh God,
I love the feel of you.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.753
You smell
like a turbo captain!

06:55.853 --> 06:58.651
Dude,
it's finally happeni-ing!

07:00.318 --> 07:01.485
Now I know
what we are missing, guys.

07:01.531 --> 07:03.173
You have been...
Yeah, you guys are on to something.

07:03.208 --> 07:05.541
I usually cup the butt
for support.

07:05.619 --> 07:06.656
Oh, it's nice.

07:06.913 --> 07:08.190
Oh yeah,
there it is.

07:08.225 --> 07:10.076
Our groins
are usually closer...

07:10.111 --> 07:11.505
Yes, it's like
they're clapping...

07:11.540 --> 07:12.784
They almost
slap each other.

07:13.091 --> 07:14.319
- Yeah, we're not gonna do that.
- Yeah, not gonna do it.

07:14.519 --> 07:15.636
Excuse me.

07:17.109 --> 07:19.184
<i>To hell with
doing my goodbyes too early,</i>

07:19.251 --> 07:20.993
<i>I want my moment
with Doctor Cox,</i>

07:21.028 --> 07:22.345
<i>and I want it now.</i>

07:22.705 --> 07:25.089
Doctor Cox,
since this is my last day,

07:25.109 --> 07:26.384
I got you
a little something.

07:26.419 --> 07:27.432
You know,
as a thank you.

07:27.466 --> 07:29.388
Because...
In my mind...

07:29.918 --> 07:31.870
You're the one who made me
the man I am today.

07:31.905 --> 07:33.159
You can't blame me
for that.

07:33.194 --> 07:34.611
No,
it's too mean.

07:34.781 --> 07:37.102
It's a book
of all your rants!

07:37.379 --> 07:38.848
I always
wrote them down.

07:39.196 --> 07:41.020
- Wow...
- Check it out.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.756
Leather bound,
I did the calligraphy.

07:44.038 --> 07:45.506
The number
next to each passage

07:45.541 --> 07:47.780
is a rating system
from 1 to 5,

07:47.817 --> 07:49.568
depending on how much
that particular rant

07:49.603 --> 07:50.719
hurt me emotionally.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.852
<i>One being something
I could easily shrug off,</i>

07:52.887 --> 07:56.551
and 5 being something that
still makes me want to cut myself.

07:56.721 --> 07:58.106
Oh, look:

07:58.141 --> 08:00.829
"The only way you could be
less productive right now

08:00.864 --> 08:01.955
is if you were,
in fact,

08:01.996 --> 08:04.112
the wall on
what you're leaning against."

08:04.221 --> 08:06.721
That one used to be a five,
but now it's a four.

08:06.721 --> 08:08.634
I still well up
when I think about it,

08:08.676 --> 08:10.615
but now
I can fall asleep after.

08:10.650 --> 08:12.144
Who wants to see
what Jordan does

08:12.179 --> 08:12.879
when she's bored?

08:15.022 --> 08:15.877
<i>Hey,
Newbie,</i>

08:16.262 --> 08:19.205
What if say, I wanna
to locate something in here

08:19.240 --> 08:21.141
about just
how little I care about

08:21.176 --> 08:23.122
any given moment that you and I
have spent together?

08:23.322 --> 08:24.052
<i>Good question.</i>

08:24.098 --> 08:28.446
You just go to the glossary,
and you see, "How little I care."

08:28.481 --> 08:31.222
Page 19.
Boom, page turn.

08:31.522 --> 08:35.307
Things I care as little about
as JD's last day of residency.

08:35.323 --> 08:38.232
Ha-ha-ha-ha,
I remember this one!

08:39.322 --> 08:41.822
Every hybrid car,
every talk-show host,

08:41.823 --> 08:44.820
everything on the planet,
everything in the solar system,

08:44.855 --> 08:46.957
and everything, everything,
everything, everything...

08:48.323 --> 08:50.590
Everything that exist
past, present and future,

08:50.625 --> 08:52.631
and all discovered
and undiscovered to mention is,

08:52.723 --> 08:53.984
and of course...

08:54.823 --> 08:56.667
- Hugh Jackman!
- Hugh Jackman!

08:57.800 --> 08:59.478
That was nice, I liked that.
We shared that.

08:59.924 --> 09:00.507
<i>Me too,</i>

09:00.538 --> 09:02.346
because it's
the exact sentiment

09:02.372 --> 09:04.312
that I wanna
to put out there for you

09:04.347 --> 09:05.947
on your last day
of work here.

09:06.294 --> 09:07.847
Thank you
for this lovely present.

09:08.624 --> 09:11.664
Okay, um...
You're welcome.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.782
Up close,
you're not a handsome man.

09:20.224 --> 09:22.098
Thank you,
Mrs. Stonewater.

09:22.325 --> 09:24.174
When you gone,
he's gonna hit me.

09:24.225 --> 09:26.268
Mom, he is
not going to do that.

09:26.303 --> 09:27.083
Doctor Dorian?

09:27.118 --> 09:29.546
I would never hit a patient,
Mrs. Stonewater.

09:29.581 --> 09:30.561
I am not a hitter.

09:30.596 --> 09:31.817
See,
he hates hitting.

09:31.825 --> 09:33.741
Well, I wouldn't say
that I <i>hate</i> hitting.

09:33.776 --> 09:34.769
That's a little strange.

09:34.804 --> 09:37.460
D-D-Does wrestling count
as hitting?

09:37.495 --> 09:38.574
Because my friend,
Turk and I,

09:38.613 --> 09:40.325
sometimes wrestle
and I really like that.

09:40.525 --> 09:42.201
When you're gone,
he's gonna wrestle me!

09:42.225 --> 09:44.939
No, only if you tickle me first,
that's what Turk does.

09:44.974 --> 09:46.467
Now
he wants to tickle me!

09:46.777 --> 09:47.583
Are you an idiot?

09:47.751 --> 09:49.212
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

09:53.726 --> 09:56.278
That is not my mom,
okay, uh...

09:56.579 --> 09:58.662
This paranoia,
and a delirium,

09:58.697 --> 10:01.876
and it's last few weeks,
it's like she's just checking out and--

10:01.926 --> 10:03.986
I know it's frustrating,
but I promise you,

10:04.021 --> 10:05.222
we're gonna find
the answer.

10:05.726 --> 10:07.390
<i>He's gonna hit me
when you leave!</i>

10:07.755 --> 10:10.152
I'm almost positive
I won't!

10:10.891 --> 10:12.287
Do you think you need
the "almost" part?

10:12.599 --> 10:15.689
I am very positive I won't!
It will never happen.

10:16.566 --> 10:17.262
Sorry.

10:17.327 --> 10:18.327
You're no doctor?

10:18.427 --> 10:20.454
Actually,
it's my last day.

10:20.527 --> 10:21.780
Yeah,
makes sense.

10:22.827 --> 10:23.927
That was hurtful.

10:29.807 --> 10:31.292
Can there be
good without evil?

10:31.328 --> 10:33.258
It's probably a question
for your priest.

10:33.293 --> 10:34.240
I'm Jewish.

10:34.275 --> 10:35.552
Really?
Shalom!

10:35.858 --> 10:37.117
- What?
- Never mind.

10:37.328 --> 10:39.002
That "good-evil" thing
was in my head

10:39.037 --> 10:39.728
because I was watching
"Unbreakable"

10:40.228 --> 10:41.867
by Manight Shyamalan.

10:42.328 --> 10:44.766
It's "M. Night",
you-you don't say "Ma-night",

10:44.801 --> 10:46.693
it's-it's M. Night,
no Ma.

10:46.728 --> 10:47.832
No, it's Ma!

10:47.892 --> 10:50.521
Like Thomas Haur,
F. Maria Abraham.

10:51.128 --> 10:52.035
Don't think so...

10:52.420 --> 10:53.923
- No Ma?
- No Ma.

10:53.929 --> 10:55.074
<i>Well,
that's funny.</i>

10:55.326 --> 10:56.463
Cause we've bowling
the other night,

10:56.498 --> 10:58.828
and he says, "Man, no one ever
says my name right."

10:58.829 --> 11:01.320
I said, "Ma, you've got
two bigger problems than that."

11:01.355 --> 11:02.659
One of them
is that seven tense split

11:02.694 --> 11:03.714
you live for yourself...

11:04.602 --> 11:05.574
<i>And the other one...</i>

11:05.952 --> 11:06.948
is how about trying
to write a movie

11:07.024 --> 11:08.329
without a big
twist ending.

11:08.364 --> 11:10.287
Well, he took offence,
got pissed,

11:10.322 --> 11:12.411
he wouldn't talk me
for a good hour, but...

11:12.446 --> 11:13.934
He loosened up
on the hay, right?

11:14.474 --> 11:16.485
Yeah, I'm sure
that's a true story.

11:16.630 --> 11:18.858
Anyway, I wanted to do
something big

11:18.893 --> 11:20.681
for your departure,
but now it is my wife

11:20.716 --> 11:22.078
who's taken up
all my time.

11:22.130 --> 11:23.683
I wanted to spend all night
in the lab,

11:23.714 --> 11:24.895
but she wanted
to play cards.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.208
You have a lab?

11:26.530 --> 11:29.459
So I decided to go simple.
What would you say...

11:30.971 --> 11:31.969
this is?

11:32.915 --> 11:35.519
Seems like a really
gay piece of man jewelry.

11:35.530 --> 11:36.430
It is.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.524
It's also the penny

11:37.600 --> 11:39.794
that you put in the door,
eight years ago.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.701
For the last time,
I did not put a penny in the door!

11:42.736 --> 11:44.131
- Admit it!
- Oh God!

11:44.531 --> 11:45.696
Why did you
do that?

11:45.801 --> 11:46.876
Because
I read in a book...

11:46.965 --> 11:48.725
that if you surprise someone
with an accusation,

11:48.756 --> 11:50.137
they're more likely
to tell you the truth.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.733
Nah, I don't really think
that's gonna work.

11:51.768 --> 11:53.246
Okay, well,
I'm not discouraged.

11:53.281 --> 11:53.892
You know
what they say.

11:53.927 --> 11:54.466
You admit it?

11:54.662 --> 11:55.462
Could you stop
doing that?

11:55.491 --> 11:56.494
It's nothing's
gonna happen.

11:56.771 --> 11:58.697
Don't feel bad,
I'm probably doing it wrong.

12:04.479 --> 12:05.164
Admit!

12:07.732 --> 12:08.520
Doctor Dorian,

12:08.551 --> 12:10.712
<i>if the patient says
his painkillers aren't working,</i>

12:10.763 --> 12:12.705
how do we know
if he's just trying to scam drugs

12:12.740 --> 12:14.339
or if he really needs
more pain meds?

12:14.374 --> 12:16.416
What I recommend is
taking a safety pin

12:16.459 --> 12:19.116
and then just give him
a quick little sta-ab, okay!

12:19.732 --> 12:21.222
<i>Kidding.
Guys...</i>

12:21.253 --> 12:22.375
We don't ever stab.

12:24.691 --> 12:25.791
<i>With pain meds,</i>

12:25.826 --> 12:27.373
it's hard to gauge...

12:28.533 --> 12:29.568
I'm gonna miss you
so much.

12:29.603 --> 12:31.260
C'mon, squeeze me
like you mean it.

12:31.295 --> 12:32.733
You smell
like it's hot of...

12:32.768 --> 12:34.621
It's hot in my heart.

12:35.045 --> 12:35.897
Get out of here.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.104
Okay,
I can understand

12:41.139 --> 12:42.678
that might have
seemed a little girly,

12:42.713 --> 12:43.762
even for me.

12:44.133 --> 12:44.981
M-m, not really.

12:45.052 --> 12:45.567
You know, Jo,

12:45.602 --> 12:47.534
I'm not really taking comments
right now.

12:47.569 --> 12:50.114
No, no, it's sort of
an announcement phase, okay?

12:50.617 --> 12:51.911
Announcement
number one:

12:51.957 --> 12:55.563
Starting tomorrow, Doctor Cox
will be leading intern rounds.

12:55.598 --> 12:57.672
Sadly,
it is my last day.

12:58.334 --> 13:01.012
You are now
free to comment.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.579
Who would like
to start us off?

13:04.986 --> 13:05.887
<i>Nobody?</i>

13:06.314 --> 13:06.966
Jo?

13:07.234 --> 13:09.005
It's funny, you were--
you were eager

13:09.040 --> 13:10.935
to make a comment
only moments ago.

13:11.435 --> 13:12.637
No,
I got nothing.

13:12.735 --> 13:14.237
I order you
to comment!

13:14.735 --> 13:15.594
Umm...

13:16.135 --> 13:17.835
I'll miss you...?

13:18.035 --> 13:19.433
Oh, Jo!

13:19.635 --> 13:20.584
I'll miss you too!

13:20.635 --> 13:22.024
It's over, Sunny,
it's too late.

13:22.835 --> 13:25.423
There he is...
Speak of the devil!

13:25.435 --> 13:28.381
I was just prepping these guys
for you to take over.

13:28.435 --> 13:30.782
Maybe you'd like to
say a few words

13:30.905 --> 13:33.255
about how you and I
got started our relationship

13:33.336 --> 13:35.513
began as
a student and teacher thing,

13:35.548 --> 13:38.342
and then evolved into something
a whole lot more.

13:38.377 --> 13:39.800
<i>The floor, Perry...</i>

13:40.565 --> 13:41.757
is yours.

13:43.429 --> 13:44.468
I'm okay.

13:45.327 --> 13:47.026
He's okay.
You're okay?

13:47.061 --> 13:48.888
He's okay,
okay, uh...

13:48.936 --> 13:50.090
I guess I'll just have
to settle

13:50.126 --> 13:53.515
for handing over
the ceremonial reins...

13:54.252 --> 13:55.294
Take the reins,
please.

13:55.329 --> 13:55.937
Never want to.

13:55.937 --> 13:56.772
Take the reins.

13:56.807 --> 13:57.537
I don't want
the reins.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.237
- Please, take the reins.
- I'm not taking the reins.

13:59.537 --> 14:01.138
I can take the reins
and just hold them for him!

14:01.237 --> 14:02.901
I felt that could work out
for everyone.

14:03.453 --> 14:04.253
Here you go,
they're heavy.

14:04.308 --> 14:05.337
This guy can pull,
haha...

14:05.472 --> 14:06.825
No one's
taking the reins!

14:06.937 --> 14:08.594
Well then, what am I gonna do
with the reins?

14:08.920 --> 14:11.021
Reins are on the ground.
Happy now?

14:13.237 --> 14:14.358
<i>Alright, children,</i>

14:14.404 --> 14:15.547
tomorrow morning,
I want you prepped

14:15.593 --> 14:16.537
on the endocrine system.

14:16.737 --> 14:18.157
At least let me
pass of the torch...

14:18.192 --> 14:20.394
Oh, for the love of God,
disperse!

14:22.588 --> 14:24.349
Can you hold this please,
it's very hot.

14:25.765 --> 14:26.910
<i>And just like that,</i>

14:26.988 --> 14:29.127
<i>it was time
to ruin someone's day.</i>

14:36.938 --> 14:38.697
She has
Huntington's Disease?

14:38.941 --> 14:41.466
It's a degenerative
brain disease.

14:41.865 --> 14:44.505
Causes you to lose control
of your movement

14:44.540 --> 14:45.726
and mental ability.

14:46.239 --> 14:47.892
It can also
change your personality,

14:47.927 --> 14:49.061
like with your mom.

14:51.339 --> 14:52.507
So, uh,
what do we do?

14:53.133 --> 14:55.095
Unfortunately,
there is no cure.

14:56.592 --> 14:58.186
Eventually,
it will take her.

14:59.739 --> 15:00.908
Oh, geez...

15:02.439 --> 15:04.521
<i>Sometimes you just have
to barrel through,</i>

15:04.551 --> 15:06.032
<i>no matter
how much it sucks.</i>

15:06.485 --> 15:08.189
<i>And...
Mr. Stonewater,</i>

15:08.277 --> 15:10.749
Huntington's is caused
by a faulty gene.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.174
And since your mother
has it,

15:15.556 --> 15:18.283
you have a 50/50 chance
of having it too.

15:20.688 --> 15:23.594
We can test you for it,
if you want.

15:25.461 --> 15:28.027
If we find out
that I have it early on,

15:28.342 --> 15:29.892
are there
any treatment options?

15:30.041 --> 15:31.464
Nothing substantional yet.

15:33.169 --> 15:35.256
I can only tell you
<i>if</i> you have it.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.934
I... can't even tell
when the disease would hit you,

15:37.969 --> 15:38.950
if you do have it.

15:40.241 --> 15:42.777
Could be in your 70s,
like your mom, or--

15:43.041 --> 15:44.091
<i>Could be sooner.</i>

15:44.741 --> 15:45.729
Could be sooner.

15:48.241 --> 15:49.542
I am so sorry.

15:52.942 --> 15:53.942
Do I have
a few minutes?

15:54.711 --> 15:55.415
Sure.

16:06.903 --> 16:08.740
<i>I'm so bummed
about Ms. Stonewater,</i>

16:08.766 --> 16:11.311
<i>I totally spaced and forgot
what's wrong with Benjamin here.</i>

16:12.127 --> 16:13.887
<i>Is he the one
with the broken ribs?</i>

16:14.589 --> 16:18.036
<i>Nope. Maybe he is
the guy with sinus polyps?</i>

16:18.059 --> 16:19.447
<i>I don't think
there is any polyps,</i>

16:19.472 --> 16:21.742
<i>but he definitely has some
oily skin issues.</i>

16:21.890 --> 16:24.403
<i>I should try him onto
that dynamite apricot scrub</i>

16:24.438 --> 16:25.576
<i>I stole from Elliot.</i>

16:26.543 --> 16:28.346
<i>Oh, come on!
Focus!</i>

16:28.754 --> 16:30.527
<i>I s'pose I could go
get his chart,</i>

16:30.562 --> 16:32.831
<i>but I left it
all the way downstairs...</i>

16:33.338 --> 16:35.128
<i>Come on, man,
you got eight years</i>

16:35.163 --> 16:37.077
<i>of medical experience.
Use it!</i>

16:37.878 --> 16:39.683
<i>Maybe you can
smell it out...</i>

16:40.944 --> 16:43.928
<i>I want to say it smells like
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</i>

16:44.618 --> 16:45.351
<i>What are you doing?</i>

16:45.396 --> 16:47.552
<i>You don't know what
any diseases smell like!</i>

16:47.854 --> 16:48.798
<i>Ah, to hell with it.</i>

16:48.833 --> 16:49.923
What do
you have again?

16:49.958 --> 16:51.842
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.647
Of course you do,
you reek of it.

16:54.404 --> 16:55.070
I'm sorry.

16:55.611 --> 16:57.950
<i>See, Benjamin understands
that you're human,</i>

16:58.017 --> 16:59.995
<i>that you're having kind of
an overwhelming day.</i>

17:00.227 --> 17:01.966
<i>Give him a smile,
as a "thank you"!</i>

17:02.345 --> 17:03.661
I want a new doctor.

17:03.746 --> 17:05.964
Uh, no, I've been working
my butt off

17:06.000 --> 17:07.604
taking care of you
for the last two weeks,

17:07.638 --> 17:09.640
so I'm afraid
the answer is "no", Benjamin.

17:09.744 --> 17:11.093
My name is Roger.

17:11.127 --> 17:12.578
I'll get you
a new doctor.

17:16.515 --> 17:17.627
What's wrong?

17:18.512 --> 17:19.077
<i>Did you find out</i>

17:19.097 --> 17:20.457
that I am replacing
your kitchen counter tops

17:20.492 --> 17:21.719
with a prettier ones
from my apartment,

17:21.763 --> 17:22.278
because if you're mad,

17:22.313 --> 17:23.546
I can stop those workers
right now.

17:23.646 --> 17:25.191
What?
No, Elliot...

17:25.445 --> 17:27.196
I'm upset because
Huntington's Disease sucks,

17:27.477 --> 17:30.641
Doctor Cox is a jerk,
I'm such a crappy doctor,

17:30.676 --> 17:32.076
I just got dumped
by a patient,

17:32.196 --> 17:34.546
and no one but you and Turk
even cares that I am leaving!

17:38.046 --> 17:39.023
What about them?

17:40.233 --> 17:41.746
I'm not leaving yet!

17:42.032 --> 17:44.360
I'm just getting some air,
but thank you!

17:44.744 --> 17:47.796
Thank you all! You know,
I've always said that

17:47.831 --> 17:49.953
I-I came to Sacred Heart
a boy,

17:50.088 --> 17:51.204
and it's turn me into--

17:51.238 --> 17:53.075
They are waving at me,
genius.

17:53.110 --> 17:54.512
I took
my favourite table,

17:54.549 --> 17:56.341
and I'm bailing out
of that coffee place.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.295
Bye gang!

17:57.296 --> 17:59.478
- Bye, Bob.
- Bye, Bob!

17:59.747 --> 18:02.440
But you left a year ago!
You got cake!

18:02.747 --> 18:04.146
He got a cake!

18:05.147 --> 18:06.602
Who changed my sign?

18:08.248 --> 18:11.237
How dare you change
somebody's sign?!

18:11.548 --> 18:13.583
You stupid
sign changers?!

18:13.618 --> 18:14.348
Hey, relax.

18:14.348 --> 18:15.614
They're sign changers!

18:16.188 --> 18:17.038
I'll fix it.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.702
Oh, that's right,
I forgot Tina in accounting

18:21.737 --> 18:24.027
left for eight days
to climb on Kilimanjaro!

18:24.148 --> 18:25.133
How cool is that?

18:25.348 --> 18:26.644
- Elliot!
- <i>What?</i>

18:26.679 --> 18:28.048
I just think
she's very brave!

18:28.083 --> 18:29.317
With her wooden leg
and all.

18:29.549 --> 18:31.949
Hey Elliot, I can see down
your blouse from here!

18:32.449 --> 18:34.248
I hope
you fall and die, Todd!

18:34.249 --> 18:35.871
What a way to go!

18:38.049 --> 18:39.533
There,
lil' better.

18:40.149 --> 18:41.849
So what the hell
did you think

18:41.850 --> 18:43.833
leaving this place
was gonna be like?

18:44.477 --> 18:47.821
Well, I guess I felt there would be
a lot of heartfelt goodbyes...

18:48.249 --> 18:50.294
When I was finally
ready to leave,

18:50.329 --> 18:53.871
it'd be like one of those
great old sitcom finales...

19:04.550 --> 19:05.750
We got a trouble
in here!

19:11.050 --> 19:12.828
We all gonna die!

19:17.374 --> 19:19.027
Why would they wire
all the power

19:19.074 --> 19:20.177
through one switch?

19:20.207 --> 19:21.654
That seems crazy!

19:23.399 --> 19:26.001
Well, I'm afraid all
I can offer you is a handshake.

19:26.351 --> 19:27.374
I'll take it, sir.

19:27.798 --> 19:29.312
Have a great life,
Dorian.

19:29.347 --> 19:30.359
Thank you.

19:31.051 --> 19:32.501
Get as much tail
as you can.

19:33.064 --> 19:34.284
I always do, sir.

19:34.551 --> 19:36.313
Already through
a morning sex today.

19:36.451 --> 19:37.652
Daddy girl!

19:41.963 --> 19:42.593
To all goodbyes,

19:42.648 --> 19:44.007
maybe you should just
ask for them.

19:45.066 --> 19:45.985
You're right.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.632
<i>My exchange with Doctor Kelso
renewed my strength.</i>

19:48.893 --> 19:51.242
<i>Other men had no problem
saying what they wanted,</i>

19:51.263 --> 19:55.360
<i>and sure, sometimes it was
a ridiculous, ridiculous request</i>

19:55.395 --> 19:56.093
Admit
that you did it!

19:56.128 --> 19:56.752
No!

19:56.752 --> 19:57.752
- 'Mit!
- No!

19:59.545 --> 20:00.052
Dammit!

20:00.087 --> 20:01.195
<i>And sometimes,
it's even</i>

20:01.216 --> 20:03.373
<i>not wanting to know
if you have a fatal disease.</i>

20:03.408 --> 20:04.401
Hey, uh,
Doctor Dorian...

20:04.422 --> 20:05.967
I decided not
to take that test, okay?

20:06.934 --> 20:07.577
Okay...

20:08.453 --> 20:11.080
<i>Either way, it was time for me
to follow their league.</i>

20:11.953 --> 20:14.475
Doctor Cox,
I want something from you.

20:14.553 --> 20:16.853
I know you do, Newbie,
and I have been

20:16.854 --> 20:18.828
searching through
this wonderful book

20:18.853 --> 20:19.508
that you gave me,

20:19.523 --> 20:22.081
trying to find
the exact right speech

20:22.204 --> 20:22.960
to share with you,

20:22.995 --> 20:25.959
but alas, there's nothing in here on
"Barking up the wrong tree,"

20:25.994 --> 20:27.601
or even a
"Turn back <i>now</i>

20:27.632 --> 20:30.654
because this doesn't end
well for you" sections, so...

20:31.054 --> 20:32.881
I'm gonna have
to go ahead and wing it.

20:33.330 --> 20:34.405
Let's see what happens.

20:34.754 --> 20:36.761
Noobie, I know
that you want this

20:36.844 --> 20:38.714
to be a very special day
for the both of us.

20:38.749 --> 20:40.173
I get that,
I truly do.

20:40.617 --> 20:43.124
You want feelings to be shared,
you want hugs to flow.

20:43.654 --> 20:46.378
But that is not now
nor is it ever been who I am,

20:46.413 --> 20:47.251
and you know that.

20:47.882 --> 20:48.955
I'm real sorry there,
Newbie,

20:49.017 --> 20:51.577
but this is not
a special day for me,

20:51.608 --> 20:54.105
it's just...
a day.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.444
If you put that down
in the book later,

20:59.402 --> 21:00.511
give it a five.

21:01.155 --> 21:01.889
Fair enough.

21:16.956 --> 21:18.466
How could Dan
not want to know

21:18.501 --> 21:19.695
if he has
Huntington's Disease?

21:20.096 --> 21:21.530
<i>Maybe he's in denial.</i>

21:21.827 --> 21:23.699
<i>I mean if it were me,
I've been gone crazy.</i>

21:24.738 --> 21:25.917
I'm gonna go
talk to him.

21:25.956 --> 21:27.340
D-I implore you,

21:27.375 --> 21:30.412
please do the one thing
I am beyond confident

21:30.447 --> 21:32.957
that you know how to do
nothing do nothing.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.992
It is
the patient's decision.

21:35.179 --> 21:37.549
Has Perry told you
how he feels about you yet?

21:37.584 --> 21:39.551
No, and he says
he is not going to.

21:39.557 --> 21:41.640
Well, just wait him out,
you'll beat him in it.

21:41.923 --> 21:44.099
Un...
Let it arrive...

21:44.247 --> 21:45.620
acceptable...

21:45.621 --> 21:47.076
Unacceptable.

21:48.253 --> 21:50.068
You love torturing him,
don't you?

21:50.148 --> 21:51.047
I do.

21:51.917 --> 21:53.638
How come
you never tortured me?

21:54.358 --> 21:55.758
You know like
when I just started.

21:56.158 --> 21:57.756
You were Bambi!

21:58.040 --> 22:00.100
Somebody had to teach you
how to walk.

22:01.558 --> 22:02.878
Thank you for that.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.250
For being my teacher.

22:08.249 --> 22:09.307
No problem.

22:12.958 --> 22:15.470
Is there anything I can do
to repay the favor?

22:16.359 --> 22:18.669
Tell me my husband loves me
more than he loves you.

22:19.159 --> 22:20.459
It's about the same.

22:22.359 --> 22:23.391
I'll take it.

22:26.759 --> 22:28.500
I'm gonna miss you,
Bambi.

22:29.559 --> 22:30.785
And I'll miss you too.

22:46.260 --> 22:48.612
- Why are you stopping?
- Why are <i>you</i> stopping?

22:48.647 --> 22:50.208
- I don't wanna say.
- Just say!

22:50.360 --> 22:51.069
Let's face it.

22:51.110 --> 22:52.200
We said "goodbye"
too early,

22:52.231 --> 22:53.827
I don't think
I've got another hug in me.

22:53.862 --> 22:56.020
Honest to God, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.743
How can I ever
not want to hug you?

22:57.778 --> 22:59.183
Has the world
gone mad?

22:59.560 --> 23:01.948
It's just crazy!
We can do this.

23:01.983 --> 23:03.461
You're absolutely right buddy,
come here!

23:08.179 --> 23:09.257
Nope,
not feeling it.

23:09.461 --> 23:12.213
You smell like regret.
Let it go.

23:16.317 --> 23:17.854
Young lady,
are you responsible

23:17.889 --> 23:19.553
for jamming
those elevator doors?

23:19.561 --> 23:21.392
No, good sir,
I am not.

23:21.644 --> 23:22.912
Tell the truth.

23:23.561 --> 23:26.277
Okay, I did it.
But it was an accident.

23:26.562 --> 23:29.130
That's okay.
Because you came clean!

23:29.462 --> 23:30.589
And here's ten dollars.

23:30.624 --> 23:31.665
Go buy
some ice cream!

23:32.362 --> 23:33.569
This is stupid.

23:34.049 --> 23:35.376
He blackmailed me
into doing this.

23:35.962 --> 23:37.802
No improving...
Give me the money back.

23:37.962 --> 23:39.779
No, my script says
to rip it up

23:39.814 --> 23:41.048
and walk away
dramatically.

23:49.463 --> 23:51.315
She was supposed
to be my long-lost sister,

23:51.350 --> 23:52.010
were you getting that?

23:52.063 --> 23:53.940
Look,
it's been a very long day.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.489
Well, long days are
like pancakes...

23:55.546 --> 23:55.975
Admit it!

23:56.011 --> 23:57.375
Fine!
I put penny in the door.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.743
It was eight years ago!

23:58.963 --> 24:00.311
Oh, what do you know,
it finally worked.

24:00.563 --> 24:01.611
It was an accident.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.797
It fell out of my pocket
and rolled into the door.

24:04.832 --> 24:07.136
It was my first day,
I didn't wanted you to be mad.

24:07.171 --> 24:08.378
Do you believe me?

24:08.563 --> 24:09.799
Yeah,
I saw it happen.

24:10.164 --> 24:12.389
If you saw it happen,
then why did you

24:12.424 --> 24:14.283
asked me back then
if I put a penny in the door?

24:14.364 --> 24:16.954
It was a test of character.
You failed.

24:17.264 --> 24:19.124
And you lost out
on a wonderful friendship.

24:21.364 --> 24:23.020
We could
still be friends!

24:30.064 --> 24:33.025
So you're actually gonna stop
working around here?

24:33.165 --> 24:34.566
That's right, Ted.

24:34.601 --> 24:37.365
So you're actually gonna stop
working around he..

24:38.496 --> 24:39.836
- Thanks.
- No worries.

24:39.981 --> 24:42.112
Did you know
it's Doctor Dorian's last day?

24:42.147 --> 24:44.965
You should give him a hug
and share your feelings about him.

24:45.009 --> 24:46.087
Do you think
you're funny?

24:46.258 --> 24:48.020
Funny looking pal!

24:51.905 --> 24:53.272
Hey, you.

24:53.816 --> 24:56.407
I-I'm trying to develop
my sentimental side.

24:56.566 --> 24:58.366
You know,
for my stupid kids,

24:58.367 --> 25:00.366
and you and I
did it once, so...

25:04.366 --> 25:05.566
Take care.

25:06.166 --> 25:07.033
Thanks, Jordan.

25:07.402 --> 25:10.266
So you're actually gonna stop
working around here?

25:14.454 --> 25:15.651
Ted, come here.

25:15.686 --> 25:16.922
I need to be horrible
to someone.

25:18.567 --> 25:19.782
That's weird
that you came.

25:19.817 --> 25:21.567
Uh, you seem
like you need it.

25:21.767 --> 25:24.072
I am supersensitive
about my skin today.

25:24.107 --> 25:25.136
Focus on that.

25:25.171 --> 25:27.764
- It looks really blotchy.
- Yeah, and check this thing out!

25:27.799 --> 25:30.367
- Did you pick that?
- No, it did it by itself!

25:30.367 --> 25:32.106
I wanna touch it,
but I don't!

25:34.567 --> 25:36.503
Did you just page me
to ask me

25:36.538 --> 25:38.967
how much Ibuprofen
to give Mrs. Lensner here?

25:39.002 --> 25:41.152
Oh, I was worried
it would excacerpate the patient...

25:41.187 --> 25:42.585
It's Ibuprofen!

25:42.590 --> 25:44.531
Here's what you do:
When she wakes up,

25:44.566 --> 25:46.393
get her to open her mouth,
nice and wide,

25:46.463 --> 25:49.299
then get some of those
Ibuprofen pills in your hand, and

25:49.334 --> 25:50.196
throw them at her!

25:50.368 --> 25:53.268
Whatever sticks in there,
that's the correct dosage!

25:53.568 --> 25:55.439
And the cycle repeats, huh?

25:55.768 --> 25:56.768
Beg your pardon?

25:56.962 --> 25:58.911
You yelled at me
for the very same thing,

25:58.946 --> 25:59.922
when I was an intern.

26:00.387 --> 26:01.729
I'm gonna go ahead
and jot that down

26:01.764 --> 26:03.981
as one of the most
fascinating tidbits of the day!

26:05.784 --> 26:08.599
<i>So maybe that's
who Perry Ullysses Cox is...</i>

26:08.834 --> 26:11.117
<i>A gruff,
insensitive teacher.</i>

26:11.673 --> 26:13.315
<i>And after everything
we went through,</i>

26:13.350 --> 26:15.310
<i>if I'm still just
another student to him...</i>

26:15.769 --> 26:17.909
<i>It doesn't mean
I should be any less grateful.</i>

26:17.969 --> 26:19.724
Thank you for everything,
Doctor Cox.

26:19.769 --> 26:20.539
Keep moving.

26:24.769 --> 26:25.869
<i>I expected that.</i>

26:27.770 --> 26:29.182
<i>I didn't expect this.</i>

26:30.370 --> 26:31.170
We're sorry...

26:31.538 --> 26:32.232
About what?

26:32.370 --> 26:34.393
- I blew my goodbye, I did it too early,
- The whole moving in, I totally blew it

26:34.428 --> 26:35.545
- now I can't hug you,
- 'cause I feel like I was

26:35.576 --> 26:36.447
- what kind of a friend am I?
- going to lose you end of all...

26:36.482 --> 26:38.200
Guys, can you not talk
simultaneously?

26:38.370 --> 26:38.923
- I can,
- I can,

26:38.954 --> 26:40.176
- but I'm not sure she can...
- but I'm not sure he can...

26:40.770 --> 26:42.770
- That was awesome!
- That was awesome!

26:43.470 --> 26:45.020
Turk,
your goodbye was great.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.925
And Elliot,
I told you to move stuff in,

26:47.988 --> 26:50.351
because I want you
to be there all the time.

26:50.671 --> 26:51.998
I sublented my house!

26:52.671 --> 26:53.597
That's aggressive--

26:53.645 --> 26:55.074
I can't help it,
I lost my mind!

26:55.471 --> 26:57.835
Still, guys,
I want you to know...

26:57.870 --> 26:59.016
We're all good, okay?

26:59.971 --> 27:00.971
- Okay.
- Thanks.

27:02.071 --> 27:04.988
<i>I understood their neediness,
because I am feeling it myself.</i>

27:05.391 --> 27:06.923
<i>And I know
what's causing it...</i>

27:07.303 --> 27:08.253
<i>The future.</i>

27:08.971 --> 27:10.471
<i>I wanted to know
what was next.</i>

27:11.571 --> 27:13.171
<i>Whether we would make it
as a couple?</i>

27:14.134 --> 27:16.195
<i>Whether I would stay tight
with my friend?</i>

27:16.720 --> 27:18.723
<i>Whether he will even miss me
when I'm gone?</i>

27:21.591 --> 27:22.372
Hey.

27:23.272 --> 27:24.230
Hey!

27:25.872 --> 27:26.603
Where's your mom?

27:28.672 --> 27:29.503
Oh they, uh...

27:29.540 --> 27:32.272
They wheeled her out of her bed
to get some kind of scan.

27:33.591 --> 27:34.829
I should probably
go check on her.

27:34.966 --> 27:36.832
Before you go,
I got to ask...

27:38.514 --> 27:39.913
Why aren't you
going to get that test?

27:43.273 --> 27:44.273
I don't know.

27:45.759 --> 27:51.032
I still might, you know,
in a next few years or... days.

27:52.673 --> 27:54.884
<i>But right now,
if I found out</i>

27:54.921 --> 27:57.005
that I was eventually
gonna die from something...

28:00.974 --> 28:03.474
Once you learn that information,
you can't unlearn it.

28:05.274 --> 28:07.550
And this way,
my future is still mine.

28:09.174 --> 28:11.042
It can be whatever
I want it to be.

28:14.374 --> 28:15.374
Does that makes sense?

28:16.859 --> 28:17.648
Yeah.

28:21.975 --> 28:22.975
Thanks.

28:25.349 --> 28:26.318
You're welcome.

28:38.921 --> 28:40.536
<i>My last chart.</i>

28:43.669 --> 28:46.776
So your shift is officially over...
and that'll do it.

28:47.576 --> 28:48.963
Nice knowing you,
John Dorian.

28:49.912 --> 28:51.718
It was
nice knowing you too...

28:52.976 --> 28:54.576
What is your name?

28:55.076 --> 28:56.328
Glenn Matthews.

28:56.449 --> 28:57.638
Oh, that was easy...

28:57.859 --> 28:58.874
That's easy now.

28:59.144 --> 29:00.913
When I was a kid,
I had a horrible impediment,

29:00.948 --> 29:02.991
I'd say "Genn Mafuf".

29:03.626 --> 29:06.003
I'm glad I wasn't there
during those times...

29:06.038 --> 29:08.072
I would have turned you
to pifuf.

29:08.377 --> 29:09.669
Why would
you tell me now?

29:10.033 --> 29:11.228
It's first time
you've asked.

29:11.277 --> 29:12.346
No, it's not!

29:12.381 --> 29:13.265
Pretty sure it is.

29:13.300 --> 29:15.544
I've been here for eight years,
and I don't know your name,

29:15.579 --> 29:16.630
I call you
"The Janitor",

29:16.665 --> 29:18.477
I am sure I've asked you
what your name is.

29:18.577 --> 29:19.577
I don't think so.

29:19.670 --> 29:20.577
Really?

29:20.666 --> 29:22.287
People don't wanna know
the janitor's name.

29:22.849 --> 29:24.348
You probably
forgotten my name already.

29:25.977 --> 29:27.377
- Glenn.
- Glenn...

29:27.377 --> 29:28.212
Mafuf.

29:28.578 --> 29:32.390
Well then...
Shalom, Glenn Matthews.

29:32.708 --> 29:33.509
Shalom.

29:38.207 --> 29:38.978
Hey, Tony.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.078
What's up?

29:42.778 --> 29:43.720
Adios...

29:43.778 --> 29:44.778
See ya.

29:45.272 --> 29:48.011
<i>Things rarely go exactly
the way you want them to.</i>

29:48.283 --> 29:50.900
<i>So sometimes you make due
with whatever you can get.</i>

29:51.594 --> 29:52.383
Good night!

29:52.418 --> 29:53.240
Good night.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.392
Ah, he's finally gone.

30:01.580 --> 30:04.031
Talk about making a big deal
over nothing, you know.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.883
I mean,
Doctor Dorian was fine,

30:07.918 --> 30:09.709
but he was no better
than any other doctor.

30:10.579 --> 30:13.335
For the record, he was the best
that ever came through this dump.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.629
John Dorian was the first
and only doctor I ever met

30:18.664 --> 30:20.096
who cared
as much as I do.

30:20.697 --> 30:22.366
And you can
forget about him

30:22.397 --> 30:23.979
just an exceptional physician.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.980
Because the fact
that matters is he was...

30:28.533 --> 30:30.127
He's a damn
exceptional person.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.820
That's why
people gravitated to him.

30:33.085 --> 30:33.985
That's why I did.

30:38.181 --> 30:39.134
He was my friend.

30:40.981 --> 30:42.981
Thank you, God.

30:42.981 --> 30:45.488
That was beautiful.

30:45.981 --> 30:47.381
Oh God, no...

30:48.281 --> 30:51.151
It's okay, Perry.
You just said how you feel.

30:51.186 --> 30:54.099
Honestly, I am so full
of your love right now,

30:54.134 --> 30:56.427
I literally could not take
another drop.

30:56.981 --> 30:59.333
Brace yourself,
I am coming in.

31:02.182 --> 31:03.933
You smell
like a father figure.

31:03.934 --> 31:04.745
Oh...

31:04.945 --> 31:05.993
Please stop.

31:09.982 --> 31:12.958
Great job, Sunny,
you said your line perfectly.

31:13.082 --> 31:14.868
Oh, thanks!
I worked on it!

31:15.182 --> 31:16.740
I knew
it would set you off.

31:17.982 --> 31:19.182
Good night,
best friend.

31:22.582 --> 31:24.222
He thinks I'm
an exceptional...

31:24.883 --> 31:25.891
person!

31:26.783 --> 31:28.583
You realize that even
though he gets to leave,

31:28.584 --> 31:30.424
you...
have to stay?

31:31.183 --> 31:32.383
I didn't think
that out.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.198
No.
You didn't.

31:37.683 --> 31:39.262
<i>Endings
are never easy.</i>

31:39.583 --> 31:41.759
<i>I always build them up
so much in my head,</i>

31:41.794 --> 31:44.203
<i>they can't possibly live up
to my expectations,</i>

31:44.238 --> 31:45.681
<i>and I just end up
disappointed.</i>

31:46.584 --> 31:48.791
<i>I am not even sure
why it matters to me so much</i>

31:48.826 --> 31:49.584
<i>how things end here.</i>

31:53.784 --> 31:55.675
<i>I guess it's because
we all want to believe</i>

31:55.710 --> 31:57.610
<i>that what we do
is very important.</i>

31:58.384 --> 32:00.468
<i>That people hang
onto our every word.</i>

32:00.584 --> 32:02.084
<i>That they care
what we think.</i>

32:03.084 --> 32:05.544
<i>The truth is,
you should consider</i>

32:05.544 --> 32:07.732
<i>yourself lucky
if it even occasionally</i>

32:07.783 --> 32:09.967
<i>get to make someone,
anyone...</i>

32:10.485 --> 32:11.779
<i>feel a little better.</i>

32:12.385 --> 32:14.985
<i>After that, it's all about the people
that you let into your life.</i>

32:15.185 --> 32:18.271
<i>And as my mind drifted the faces
I've seen here before,</i>

32:18.306 --> 32:20.185
<i>I was taking
the memories of family...</i>

32:20.220 --> 32:21.326
Hey,
little brother!

32:24.185 --> 32:25.622
<i>of co-workers...</i>

32:25.657 --> 32:28.713
Goodbye-five!
From the Big Dog!

32:30.585 --> 32:31.976
<i>of lost loves...</i>

32:32.111 --> 32:33.215
You never called.

32:34.831 --> 32:35.682
I miss you.

32:36.886 --> 32:38.630
<i>Even of those
who've left us...</i>

32:38.986 --> 32:40.786
There you are!

32:42.279 --> 32:43.287
Hi, tiger!

32:43.843 --> 32:45.419
<i>And as
I rounded that corner,</i>

32:45.475 --> 32:48.643
<i>they all came at me
in a wave of shared experience.</i>

32:54.058 --> 32:55.382
Keep it all
like you do.

32:57.787 --> 32:58.787
Point-flip!

33:04.192 --> 33:05.687
I broke
my penis again.

33:05.922 --> 33:07.254
But this time
it was fun!

33:11.894 --> 33:14.563
Take care, bro!
Take real good care.

33:17.767 --> 33:18.955
I didn't kill her.

33:24.406 --> 33:26.113
Way to live
a cheery gig, bro.

33:33.472 --> 33:34.729
I got me
some white meat.

33:36.004 --> 33:38.142
Keep party later,
there'll be prostitutes.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.454
Did you ever
go on that picnic?

33:41.979 --> 33:43.030
Make sure you do.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.596
I hate you so much,
JD.

33:53.745 --> 33:55.172
It's like a baget.

33:57.789 --> 33:59.836
Hooch is crazy.

34:01.148 --> 34:04.195
<i>And even though
it felt warm and safe,</i>

34:04.708 --> 34:06.032
<i>I knew
it had to end.</i>

34:10.833 --> 34:13.370
<i>It's never good to live
in the past too long.</i>

34:14.587 --> 34:16.918
<i>As for the future,
thanks to Dan,</i>

34:16.953 --> 34:18.789
<i>it didn't seem
so scary anymore.</i>

34:19.806 --> 34:21.748
<i>It could be
whatever I want it to be.</i>

37:48.999 --> 37:51.293
<i>And who's to say
this isn't what happens?</i>

37:51.672 --> 37:54.781
<i>Who can tell me that my fantasies
won't come true?</i>

37:55.838 --> 37:57.567
<i>Just this once.</i>

37:59.800 --> 38:00.800
Good night.

38:02.141 --> 38:03.161
Good night.

38:45.913 --> 38:46.587
Hey.

38:47.523 --> 38:49.463
- Say action.
- Action.

39:09.137 --> 39:11.190
I wanna touch it,
but I don't.

39:15.159 --> 39:16.501
Chief, say what.

39:23.091 --> 39:23.822
Oh, that's funny,

39:23.848 --> 39:25.028
'cause we were bowling
the other night

39:25.057 --> 39:26.672
and he says,
"Man, no one ever says

39:26.729 --> 39:27.573
my name right."

39:27.940 --> 39:29.160
I says to him,
I says,

39:29.175 --> 39:31.209
"Ma, you got two bigger
problems than that.

39:31.254 --> 39:32.613
One of them
is that seven tense split

39:32.672 --> 39:33.683
that you left
for yourself.

39:33.870 --> 39:34.731
And another one...

39:34.885 --> 39:35.860
is how about trying
to write a movie

39:35.895 --> 39:37.096
without a big
twist ending?

39:37.579 --> 39:39.473
He says,
"What's with the accent?"

39:39.704 --> 39:40.610
I say,
"What do you mean?

39:40.661 --> 39:41.879
It's just
how I grew up."

39:42.014 --> 39:43.442
He says,
"I will put you in a movie."

39:43.573 --> 39:44.666
I said, "Okay."

39:45.189 --> 39:47.779
Then we're on a hay ride later,
and he makes a monkey face.

39:47.814 --> 39:49.894
I say,
"What in the world is this?"

39:49.929 --> 39:52.158
He says, "Hey man.
Welcome to the big time."

39:52.280 --> 39:53.924
He slaps me
across the face.

39:54.573 --> 39:56.235
Well, I didn't know
whether to...

39:57.350 --> 39:58.651
or write a screenplay.

40:00.930 --> 40:03.146
<i>Next, hit him.
Act two.</i>

40:03.621 --> 40:04.412
<i>Hit him.</i>

40:04.778 --> 40:06.786
<i>Alright, just hit him.
Come on!</i>

40:07.174 --> 40:08.121
<i>Come on!</i>

40:08.554 --> 40:09.216
<i>Hit him.</i>

40:09.727 --> 40:11.177
Got me,
you got me!

40:12.430 --> 40:15.562
# Tell me, you'll be
listening on Fridays #

40:16.175 --> 40:17.478
# She doesn't really... #

40:17.833 --> 40:19.349
Oh my God,
you're listening!

40:19.863 --> 40:21.896
<i>It's a wrap.
Thank Donald for the set up.</i>

40:44.112 --> 40:45.419
I'll really miss you.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.292
You'll top me in.

40:50.575 --> 40:51.442
<i>Good night check.</i>

40:51.704 --> 40:53.759
<i>There's the season wrap
from Judy Reyes.</i>

40:54.159 --> 40:55.451
- Oh, God...
- Mmm...

40:59.411 --> 41:00.124
Well, you bet...

41:01.745 --> 41:02.910
More defense now?

41:20.175 --> 41:21.454
<i>Alright, Donald.</i>

41:23.568 --> 41:25.871
- Camera set?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

41:36.473 --> 41:37.605
<i>Ha, check it.</i>

41:38.352 --> 41:41.005
Hey, that's the season wrap
on Zach Braff.
