02:04.056 --> 02:05.140
Oi!

02:06.973 --> 02:08.014
Mind out.

02:10.306 --> 02:11.307
Move!

02:26.307 --> 02:28.807
Look, on the west wall!

02:28.890 --> 02:30.807
Get down to the crypt!

02:33.849 --> 02:35.056
Just hold.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.348
We'll take him.

02:41.807 --> 02:44.056
- Come on, help the lads!
- Yes, my lady.

02:44.140 --> 02:47.307
Quickly, now! Quickly!
Get those in position.

02:47.390 --> 02:50.473
- Come on.
- Close the gate!

02:50.557 --> 02:52.181
That's it.

05:31.390 --> 05:34.931
Oh, for fuck's sake.
You took your time.

07:38.557 --> 07:40.515
Do you speak their tongue?

07:44.098 --> 07:46.515
Tell them to lift their swords.

09:30.223 --> 09:31.849
Valar morghulis.

09:31.931 --> 09:33.849
Valar dohaeris.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.765
Open the gate!

09:49.849 --> 09:51.265
Open the gate!

09:51.348 --> 09:53.348
Open the gate!

10:08.348 --> 10:10.140
Come. Come on.

10:11.515 --> 10:12.515
Easy.

10:39.098 --> 10:41.890
There's no need to execute me,
Ser Davos.

10:41.973 --> 10:44.557
I'll be dead before the dawn.

14:27.765 --> 14:29.640
The Night King is coming.

14:31.390 --> 14:33.390
The dead are already here.

15:58.056 --> 15:59.724
Stand your ground!

17:49.098 --> 17:50.849
Get down to the crypt.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.056
I'm not abandoning my people.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.640
Take this and go.

17:59.181 --> 18:00.807
I don't know how to use it.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.807
Stick them with the pointy end.

19:30.515 --> 19:31.890
Edd!

19:33.056 --> 19:34.348
Edd!

19:53.265 --> 19:54.557
Sam, get up!

19:59.515 --> 20:01.765
Oh, God. Sam.

20:05.931 --> 20:07.307
Edd!

21:48.890 --> 21:51.557
Fall back! Fall back!

21:53.849 --> 21:55.931
Fall back!

21:56.015 --> 21:57.098
Come on!

21:58.807 --> 21:59.807
Open the gate!

21:59.849 --> 22:01.765
Open the gate!

22:01.849 --> 22:03.056
Let us in!

22:05.265 --> 22:06.765
Open the gate!

22:06.849 --> 22:08.223
Open the gate!

22:11.056 --> 22:12.223
Keep moving!

22:16.015 --> 22:17.348
Come on!

22:20.557 --> 22:23.140
- Keep moving, fast.
- To your posts.

22:23.223 --> 22:25.223
- Go!
- Keep moving!

22:27.056 --> 22:28.807
Come on, run!

22:28.890 --> 22:30.056
Keep moving!

23:25.432 --> 23:26.807
Dany!

23:53.599 --> 23:55.515
Grab your weapon now!

23:55.599 --> 23:57.181
Guard the barricades!

23:57.265 --> 23:59.515
Through that pass!

23:59.599 --> 24:01.098
Hey! Hey! Hey!

24:01.181 --> 24:02.599
Close up the gaps!

24:02.682 --> 24:05.599
Go! Hey! Go! Go!

24:05.682 --> 24:07.599
Get in! Get in!

24:07.682 --> 24:09.348
Get in! Come on!

24:44.140 --> 24:45.765
Move!

25:20.765 --> 25:22.866
- Come on!
- Come on!

25:22.890 --> 25:24.432
- Come on!
- Come on!

25:25.890 --> 25:27.223
Protect the gate!

25:27.307 --> 25:29.348
Protect the gate!

25:29.432 --> 25:31.931
They're coming! Come on!

25:32.015 --> 25:33.599
Fall back!

25:53.515 --> 25:54.557
Light the trench!

25:55.348 --> 25:56.765
Light the trench!

25:58.056 --> 26:00.473
- Wait!
- Light the trench!

26:29.807 --> 26:31.015
She can't see us.

26:32.765 --> 26:33.807
Light the trenches!

26:48.307 --> 26:50.432
With a torch,
light the trenches!

26:50.515 --> 26:52.973
- Right there.
- Torch it!

26:54.599 --> 26:55.682
Light the trenches!

29:40.557 --> 29:41.557
Clegane.

29:47.682 --> 29:50.682
You must try
not to worry yourself.

30:02.682 --> 30:05.849
At least we're already
in a crypt.

30:10.557 --> 30:12.515
If we were up there,

30:12.599 --> 30:16.098
we might see something
everyone else is missing.

30:17.557 --> 30:19.181
Something that makes
a difference.

30:19.265 --> 30:21.973
What?

30:22.056 --> 30:23.682
Remember the Battle
of Blackwater?

30:23.765 --> 30:25.098
I brought us
through the Mud Gate.

30:25.181 --> 30:26.599
And got your face cut in half.

30:26.682 --> 30:28.390
And it made a difference.

30:30.890 --> 30:32.473
If I was out there right now...

30:32.557 --> 30:33.931
You'd die.

30:36.265 --> 30:38.265
There's nothing you can do.

30:41.849 --> 30:44.140
You might be surprised
at the lengths I'd go

30:44.223 --> 30:46.640
to avoid joining
the Army of the Dead.

30:46.724 --> 30:49.931
I could think of no organization
less suited to my talents.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.432
Witty remarks
won't make a difference.

30:54.807 --> 30:57.973
That's why we're down here,
none of us can do anything.

30:59.807 --> 31:00.890
It's the truth.

31:02.140 --> 31:04.931
It's the most heroic thing
we can do now...

31:06.390 --> 31:08.432
look the truth in the face.

31:13.265 --> 31:15.682
Maybe we should have
stayed married.

31:15.765 --> 31:17.599
You were the best of them.

31:18.807 --> 31:20.973
What a terrifying thought.

31:27.931 --> 31:29.432
It wouldn't work between us.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.432
Why not?

31:32.515 --> 31:33.931
The Dragon Queen.

31:35.931 --> 31:39.307
Your divided loyalties
would become a problem.

31:40.307 --> 31:42.056
Yes.

31:42.140 --> 31:44.973
Without the Dragon Queen,
there'd be no problem at all.

31:46.098 --> 31:47.682
We'd all be dead already.

32:09.432 --> 32:11.307
They lit the trench.

32:25.015 --> 32:26.015
Bran...

32:31.432 --> 32:33.348
I just want you to know...

32:37.515 --> 32:38.515
I wish...

32:39.724 --> 32:41.056
The things I did...

32:41.140 --> 32:44.056
Everything you did
brought you where you are now.

32:46.348 --> 32:47.724
Where you belong.

32:49.849 --> 32:51.015
Home.

33:01.724 --> 33:03.890
I'm going to go now.

33:06.557 --> 33:07.557
Go where?

34:56.306 --> 34:57.640
Man the walls!

34:58.682 --> 35:00.307
Man the walls!

35:08.515 --> 35:10.682
Man the wall!

35:10.765 --> 35:12.348
Man the walls!

35:14.181 --> 35:15.931
Come on!

35:16.015 --> 35:18.807
Get out there! Get moving!

35:18.890 --> 35:21.015
Come on. Come on! Come on!

35:24.473 --> 35:26.849
Go, go, go!

35:26.931 --> 35:28.390
Come on!

36:07.890 --> 36:09.765
They're against the wall!

36:13.890 --> 36:16.098
Get more men up here!

36:20.265 --> 36:22.348
- Fill the gaps, quickly!
- Get in there!

36:22.432 --> 36:23.973
They're climbing the walls!

36:24.056 --> 36:26.599
- Relieve the archers!
- Relieve the archers!

36:28.473 --> 36:29.849
Archers on top!

36:29.931 --> 36:32.682
- Move up!
- Go, go! Come here!

36:32.765 --> 36:34.307
- Come on!
- Move back!

36:34.390 --> 36:36.366
- Stand away!
- Go on, go on. Go! Go.

36:36.390 --> 36:38.724
- Step back.
- All the way, archers!

36:54.432 --> 36:55.682
Hold the wall!

36:55.765 --> 36:57.307
The wall, they're coming up!

36:57.390 --> 37:00.849
- Hold the wall!
- Hold the wall!

37:00.931 --> 37:02.098
Draw!

37:26.807 --> 37:27.973
Come on!

38:18.849 --> 38:20.181
They're coming up!

38:32.390 --> 38:33.557
Look out!

40:12.557 --> 40:13.682
Clegane!

40:15.140 --> 40:16.265
Clegane!

41:26.765 --> 41:28.682
Clegane!

41:28.765 --> 41:30.973
Clegane, we need you!

41:31.056 --> 41:32.307
You can't give up on us.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.599
Fuck off! We can't beat them.

41:34.682 --> 41:37.181
Don't you see that,
you stupid whore?

41:37.265 --> 41:38.973
We're fighting Death!

41:39.056 --> 41:40.390
They can't beat Death.

41:45.307 --> 41:46.557
Tell her that.

49:21.056 --> 49:22.348
Open the door!

49:24.973 --> 49:26.307
Open the door!

49:26.390 --> 49:28.150
- Come on!
- Open the door!

49:28.223 --> 49:29.640
Open the door!

49:34.432 --> 49:36.265
Please!

49:36.348 --> 49:37.515
Open it!

50:54.599 --> 50:56.265
Rah!

51:03.015 --> 51:04.098
Aah!

51:12.307 --> 51:14.890
Come on! Go!

51:14.973 --> 51:17.849
- Come on!
- Run!

51:44.056 --> 51:45.348
We've gotta go!

52:46.765 --> 52:49.849
The Lord brought
him back for a purpose.

52:54.223 --> 52:56.432
Now that purpose
has been served.

53:01.890 --> 53:02.890
I know you.

53:08.599 --> 53:09.765
And I know you.

53:17.557 --> 53:19.849
You said we'd meet again.

53:19.931 --> 53:21.140
And here we are.

53:22.181 --> 53:23.473
At the end of the world.

53:25.599 --> 53:27.557
You said I'd shut
many eyes forever.

53:29.223 --> 53:30.765
You were right about that too.

53:31.849 --> 53:33.682
Brown eyes...

53:33.765 --> 53:34.973
green eyes...

53:37.307 --> 53:38.640
and blue eyes.

53:58.098 --> 54:00.807
What do we say
to the God of Death?

54:05.056 --> 54:06.140
Not today.

54:31.640 --> 54:32.682
Here they come!

54:36.432 --> 54:37.515
Steady, lads.

54:38.890 --> 54:39.973
Steady now.

54:42.807 --> 54:44.181
Make every shot count.

54:53.599 --> 54:54.682
Over there!

54:57.931 --> 54:58.973
There!

55:39.432 --> 55:40.724
Get off.

57:17.931 --> 57:19.015
Dracarys.

01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:04.432
Come on! Come on!

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:08.931
No! No, no, no!

01:02:58.807 --> 01:03:01.181
- Bran!
- Go!

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.180
Jorah!

01:11:05.765 --> 01:11:06.931
Theon.

01:11:18.765 --> 01:11:20.307
You're a good man.

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:27.348
Thank you.

01:16:51.181 --> 01:16:52.849
I'm hurt.

01:21:31.223 --> 01:21:33.307
We have won the Great War.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.724
Now, we will win the last war.

01:21:44.724 --> 01:21:46.807
We'll rip her out
root and stem.
