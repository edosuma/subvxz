WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:03.177
Previously on "Major Crimes"...

00:03.220 --> 00:05.092
Sharon: I hope you never
have to see this,

00:05.135 --> 00:06.963
but in case I'm not there,

00:07.007 --> 00:11.272
I want you to protect yourself
against Phillip Stroh.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.969
Less than 24 hours ago,

00:13.013 --> 00:16.059
Emma told me
that she thought Phillip Stroh

00:16.103 --> 00:18.975
was back in Los Angeles,
and now she's dead.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.021
As the police
were checking out the gate

00:21.064 --> 00:23.284
to Emma's backyard,
I had a Sniffy in my pocket,

00:23.327 --> 00:25.590
giving me their contacts
and the picture

00:25.634 --> 00:27.070
they were anxious
for me to text them,

00:27.114 --> 00:28.941
infected all their devices
with malware,

00:28.985 --> 00:31.770
and now I have autonomous
control of their cells.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.207
Score!

00:33.250 --> 00:34.512
[ Laughs ] They're practically
staring at us. Look.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.732
Our investigation
of Emma's death

00:36.775 --> 00:39.517
led us directly
to the murder of Jim Bechtel.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.866
But what's the connection

00:40.910 --> 00:42.303
between a retired
real-estate developer

00:42.346 --> 00:43.652
and the drowning
of a prosecutor?

00:43.695 --> 00:45.610
We found a divorce filing
from the 1980s

00:45.654 --> 00:48.091
between a Jim Bechtel
and a Gwendolyn Bechtel,

00:48.135 --> 00:50.920
who claimed as her dependent
Phillip Stroh.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.443
I need to take off
for a few days.

00:52.487 --> 00:53.923
Get ready
for a quick exit.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.664
Don't worry. I have this.I hope so.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.709
Half the fee depends on you
finding my mother

00:57.753 --> 00:59.407
before they do.
Don't worry.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.800
I have one of the best police
departments on Earth helping me.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.498
Mason:
That's excellent work.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.282
We'll figure out what to do
after Stroh's in custody.

01:05.326 --> 01:06.762
Or dead at my feet.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.591
Dead at your feet
would be kind of perfect.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.767
Mason: Have we made any
progress at all?

01:11.810 --> 01:14.248
Well, Jim Bechtel's daughter,
Tammy,

01:14.291 --> 01:15.901
has flown in from Charlotte

01:15.945 --> 01:18.339
to make arrangements
for her father's funeral.

01:18.382 --> 01:21.342
Now, I expect her here any
minute, and she should help.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.605
In the meantime,
we have been concentrating

01:23.648 --> 01:25.911
on Gwendolyn Bechtel.
Mike.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.826
If Gwendolyn really
is Stroh's mother,

01:27.870 --> 01:29.611
that could be a partial
explanation

01:29.654 --> 01:30.916
of why he's come back.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.440
Maybe he just wanted
to say "farewell"

01:32.483 --> 01:34.485
to dear old mom
before he kicked the bucket.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.748
Or take her with him
when he goes.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.141
Sykes: Uh, one hitch --

01:38.185 --> 01:39.708
we're still trying
to confirm

01:39.751 --> 01:41.013
the checked medical records
belonged to Stroh.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.580
I'm having a bit of trouble

01:42.624 --> 01:44.843
contacting the Interpol officer
who called Emma.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.280
Yeah. Buzz?

01:46.323 --> 01:48.064
Well, our traces
on Gwen Bechtel's

01:48.108 --> 01:50.936
Social Security number
are complicated.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.330
I'll say. Well, there's no death
certificate, sir,

01:53.374 --> 01:55.985
but Gwendolyn Stroh/Bechtel's
Social

01:56.028 --> 01:57.987
hasn't been used
since 1992.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.120
There are no credit checks,
no tax filings,

02:00.163 --> 02:02.078
nothing --
she just disappeared.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.601
Just thinking
out loud,

02:03.645 --> 02:05.995
but if Stroh's mother had been
living in the L.A. area,

02:06.038 --> 02:07.823
couldn't Stroh have just
killed her years ago?

02:07.866 --> 02:09.912
Seriously?
You bloody idiot.

02:09.955 --> 02:12.697
Provenza: If Stroh already
murdered his mom,

02:12.741 --> 02:14.612
why would be hunting
for her now?

02:14.656 --> 02:16.484
Exactly. Oh, good point.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.181
And you're in charge?
God.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.836
Okay, so, you can change
your Social Security number.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.794
No, that's not
the problem.Uh, yes, sir,

02:22.838 --> 02:24.361
but the new number would
be cross-referenced

02:24.405 --> 02:26.624
with the old number by the
Internal Revenue Service.

02:26.668 --> 02:29.236
So if we search for one,
we find the other.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.716
Unless...

02:31.760 --> 02:36.199
Unless she had her new
Social Security number sealed.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.723
In my reserve detective
training, I'm told that

02:38.767 --> 02:41.900
this type of secrecy
is for Witness Protection.

02:41.944 --> 02:44.773
You're in reserve detective
training? That's a thing?

02:44.816 --> 02:47.297
And no one outside the Social
Security Administration

02:47.341 --> 02:49.604
would have her new identity,
not even law enforcement.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.258
Not even law enforcement?

02:51.301 --> 02:54.435
Oh, my God, that's ridic--
Make a call or something!

02:54.478 --> 02:57.351
Provenza: Well, if Stroh were
my son and I was rich,

02:57.394 --> 03:00.005
I don't think I'd want him
to find me either.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.312
Well, if you're on the right
track, and that's a big "if,"

03:02.356 --> 03:04.836
Gwen's new number would only
exist on a hard copy

03:04.880 --> 03:06.969
in the Social Security
headquarters in Maryland.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.449
Really? Maryland?

03:08.492 --> 03:10.755
I see. Okay.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.931
You lot run around
following the rules.

03:12.975 --> 03:15.412
I'll go...this way.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.501
Let's see who gets
to Mama Stroh first.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.503
Sanchez: A hard copy
in Maryland, sir?

03:19.547 --> 03:21.244
Even if we were able
to get a search warrant,

03:21.288 --> 03:22.811
it could take weeks
to find it.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.639
Uh, I might have
a workaround, Julio.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.771
Sykes: What about
the Social Security office

03:26.815 --> 03:28.164
where she filed
for the change?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.513
The Social Security
Administration

03:29.557 --> 03:31.211
has over a thousand
field offices.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.386
How are you gonna figure out
which one to search?

03:32.429 --> 03:34.431
Provenza:
Excuse me. Cami,

03:34.475 --> 03:39.306
could you review for us what we
know about Gwendolyn pre-1992?

03:39.349 --> 03:42.570
Mm-hmm. A Social Security number
can tell a pretty good story

03:42.613 --> 03:45.703
of a person's life, especially
if you can find a credit report

03:45.747 --> 03:47.357
to go with it.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.620
Let's do this, Julio.

03:49.664 --> 03:55.974
Gwendolyn Hope Lyle, born in
Philadelphia, PA, July 18, 1947.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.672
Attended Penn
for two years,

03:57.715 --> 03:59.500
her dad was rich,
rich, rich,

03:59.543 --> 04:02.329
and she worked at one of his
travel agencies every summer.

04:02.372 --> 04:06.550
In 1967, when she
was only 20,

04:06.594 --> 04:09.771
Gwendolyn married
Tyler Tate Stroh,

04:09.814 --> 04:11.816
a 28-year-old executive

04:11.860 --> 04:13.644
also employed by
her father's company.

04:13.688 --> 04:18.127
Gwen gave birth to her precious son, Phillip, in 1969.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.042
Oh, my God.
You people are more boring

04:20.085 --> 04:21.565
than watching
televised snooker.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.611
Her father died,
she sold the business,

04:23.654 --> 04:26.527
divorced her husband,
and bought an amazing home

04:26.570 --> 04:28.006
in Chagrin Falls, Ohio...

04:28.050 --> 04:29.312
What?!
"An amazing home"?

04:29.356 --> 04:31.009
What are you, a bloody
estate agent now?

04:31.053 --> 04:32.750
Why can't you people treat this
like an emergency?

04:32.794 --> 04:34.752
Do you have a higher gear
than sloth?

04:34.796 --> 04:36.319
Glacial, perhaps?

04:36.363 --> 04:38.321
A year later,
she married Jim Bechtel.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.975
May he rest in peace.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.281
I wonder where his daughter is.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.717
She should be here by now.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.327
Sanchez:
Oh, but way back then, sir,

04:44.371 --> 04:47.069
Tammy moved with her father
and new stepmother to Bel Air

04:47.112 --> 04:48.723
in 1985 without Phillip,

04:48.766 --> 04:52.074
who was left behind to attend
some fancy boarding school.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.902
Mason: Bet there's a lot more
to that story.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.207
Of course there's more
to the story.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.819
But none of it leads
to Mama Stroh.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.648
Gwen and Jim filed their
taxes jointly in California

05:00.691 --> 05:04.347
only once before
divorcing in 1986,

05:04.391 --> 05:10.222
and then eventually,
Gwen just disappears in 1992.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.312
On December 11, 1992.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.836
If you can't be helpful,
at least be precise.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.272
Ella, wake up!

05:16.316 --> 05:18.143
Get naked!
Come on.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.711
So, Stroh's mother
abandoned him?

05:20.755 --> 05:22.887
Looks like it.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.628
Tammy Bechtel's
on the elevator.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.588
Uh, Amy, would you give me
a hand, please?

05:31.331 --> 05:34.290
[ Elevator bell dings ]

05:34.334 --> 05:35.770
Lieutenant Provenza?

05:35.813 --> 05:38.599
Ah, that's me, and this
is Detective Sykes.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.340
Thank you for
coming, Tammy.

05:40.383 --> 05:43.952
So sorry about what
happened to your father.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.606
Sykes: We know this is
a difficult time.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.129
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
boo-hoo.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.436
Thank you.

05:49.479 --> 05:53.178
So, you're considering
Phillip as a suspect?

05:53.222 --> 05:54.702
Does that seem
likely to you?

05:54.745 --> 05:56.704
Not really.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.749
He and Daddy didn't
get along very well,

05:58.793 --> 06:01.491
but we were only a serious part
of his life for a few years,

06:01.535 --> 06:03.188
and that was decades ago.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.365
I don't really remember
that much about Phillip,

06:05.408 --> 06:08.193
and I can't imagine he recalls
that much about me, either.

06:08.237 --> 06:09.673
Then again,
Phillip was strange.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.893
Understatement
of the century.

06:11.936 --> 06:14.678
Provenza: You are aware
that your ex-stepbrother

06:14.722 --> 06:16.898
is a serial killer.

06:16.941 --> 06:20.423
The FBI came to my house
five years ago

06:20.467 --> 06:23.818
and told me about all the women
that Phillip had murdered.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.603
I was just shocked.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.345
But in retrospect,
there were signs,

06:29.389 --> 06:33.305
things that I now know are
markers for people like him.

06:33.349 --> 06:34.872
What signs?

06:34.916 --> 06:37.745
Oh, he tried to set our house
on fire a couple of times.

06:37.788 --> 06:41.009
My dog disappeared one day,
it never came back.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.446
He pushed me off the slide
in our backyard.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.666
Those aren't signs.
Those are billboards.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.581
How could they not
know something was
wrong with the kid?

06:47.624 --> 06:50.061
It's hard to give up
on your child.

06:50.105 --> 06:53.891
But now that I have girls
of my own, I...

06:53.935 --> 06:57.068
[ Echoing ] Well, so,
your father got very upset.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.027
What about your
stepmother, Gwen?

06:59.070 --> 07:02.813
[ Normal ] Daddy and Gwen, they fought over Phillip constantly.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.424
It got better when he went to
boarding school,

07:04.467 --> 07:05.903
but then they
would just argue about

07:05.947 --> 07:07.775
whether or not he should
come home for Christmas

07:07.818 --> 07:09.429
or what to do with Phillip once
we moved to L.A., but they...

07:09.472 --> 07:11.909
Like I said,
more to the story.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.346
Sykes:
Did all the quarreling stop
once you got to California?

07:14.390 --> 07:16.958
For a while, and then
about a year later,

07:17.001 --> 07:19.787
they got into a fight
that lasted for weeks.

07:19.830 --> 07:24.313
I woke up in the middle
of the night hearing...

07:24.356 --> 07:26.402
hearing Daddy screaming.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.014
And Gwen packed up
and left the next day.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.712
Did you ever see
Phillip again?

07:31.755 --> 07:34.366
No.
Once Phillip moved to L.A.,

07:34.410 --> 07:35.977
he would contact Dad
occasionally.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.631
Actually,
he hounded Daddy.

07:37.674 --> 07:42.592
He demanded to know where
his mother had gone.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.682
So stunning, really.

07:45.726 --> 07:48.206
She fought so hard
to keep her son,

07:48.250 --> 07:49.730
and then she just
abandoned him.

07:49.773 --> 07:53.168
Did you ever see or
speak to Gwen again?

07:53.211 --> 07:55.562
No. Not after
she disappeared.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.912
Damn it. I did try to look
her up once.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.609
I wanted to send her
a thank-you note.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.350
I couldn't find her
in the phone book,

08:01.393 --> 08:03.352
and that was pretty much all
we had to go on back then.

08:03.395 --> 08:06.094
Phone books?
Travel agencies? Oy.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.791
Provenza: Can we go back
just one second?

08:07.835 --> 08:09.880
You just said that
you wanted to give

08:09.924 --> 08:11.621
Gwendolyn
a thank you note.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.275
What for?

08:13.318 --> 08:15.277
I graduated from
high school in '95

08:15.320 --> 08:16.844
and an envelope
arrived in the mail

08:16.887 --> 08:18.323
with a sweet note from Gwen

08:18.367 --> 08:20.325
and $10,000 cash.Sykes: Wow.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.892
From your ex-stepmother[ Cellphone chimes ]

08:21.936 --> 08:23.459
whom you hadn't seen
since you were --

08:23.503 --> 08:25.330
9 years old.
It was obscenely generous,

08:25.374 --> 08:26.680
but no return address.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.333
What about a postmark?

08:28.377 --> 08:31.249
Yes, Pasadena, but I don't think
she actually lived there,

08:31.293 --> 08:34.296
'cause my father went looking
through all the property records

08:34.339 --> 08:35.427
where she could've
bought a home

08:35.471 --> 08:36.646
and he couldn't find anything.

had seen Mary that day.

slightly guilty.

get out of the country.
