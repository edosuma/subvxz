so you're gonna
hang out with me,

06:48.542 --> 06:49.775
and it's gonna be
a little childish,

to refocus your brain.

do these different exercises,

have a mental reminder

I'm fighting Pannie Kianzad.

07:44.498 --> 07:48.166
I know Pannie pretty well
from her past fights.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.634
I know how she works.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.003
I prepared to begin to see her

07:52.039 --> 07:53.171
already in
[speaking indistinctly ]

07:53.207 --> 07:54.639
because I have seen
her fights a long time,

07:54.675 --> 07:56.475
and me and my coach,

07:56.510 --> 07:58.910
we already studied her
for a long time,

07:58.946 --> 08:01.279
and I feel confident
about that fight

08:01.315 --> 08:05.116
and about my preparation.

08:05.152 --> 08:09.588
And I know her good,
like, strong parts.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.156
I know her weaknesses,

08:11.191 --> 08:13.859
and I believe in my game plan.

08:15.229 --> 08:17.295
How do you want to fight
the next fight?

08:18.265 --> 08:20.131
Uh, I want to --

08:20.167 --> 08:23.335
We need to strike with her
to make the most wrinkles.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.971
If I will go to,
like, takedown straight,

08:26.006 --> 08:27.706
she will defend it,

08:27.741 --> 08:29.875
So I need to strike with her
in the beginning, I think.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.276
I think you should
fight your way in

08:31.311 --> 08:33.044
so that he can't
get her timing down.
Yeah.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.913
So that she can't lead you
with the hooks.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.781
-Yeah.
-I think push her forward.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.250
Be aggressive
with the strikes.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.485
Yeah.
Bully her
up against the fence.

08:40.521 --> 08:41.987
Take her down.
Get on top.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.388
Whittaker: I think
with Julija and Pannie,

08:43.423 --> 08:45.257
the one who pushes
their game forward

08:45.292 --> 08:46.892
is gonna be the one
to be the victor.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.094
I think if Julija
gets the takedown,

08:49.129 --> 08:50.462
controls her on top

08:50.497 --> 08:52.497
and then establishes control
of the fight that way,

08:52.533 --> 08:53.498
she'll take the fight.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.033
But it's a close fight.

-Get up.
-Find the fence! Find the fence!

09:15.088 --> 09:16.821
-To the fence! To the fence!
-Run her into the fence!

09:16.857 --> 09:18.323
Stoliarenko: I think
the best way to fight her

09:18.358 --> 09:20.225
will be just to make
a pressure game of it.

09:20.260 --> 09:25.130
Of course, for me, my main thing
will be to work on my distance,

09:25.165 --> 09:26.831
to work on the pressure game.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.700
Julija, to the bag!

To the bag.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.736
Now! Run!

09:31.772 --> 09:33.838
So the best thing
to do against her

09:33.874 --> 09:35.540
is just to press her
all the fight
