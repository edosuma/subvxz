WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.171
Where's Ray?
This is important.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.773
Yo. Sorry. I was getting
a few items...

00:05.873 --> 00:07.375
Taylored.

00:07.475 --> 00:10.178
That was horrible, Ray.
I hated that.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.345
Right.
Big news.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.282
Cerebral Palsy Foundation
are giving away two tickets

00:14.382 --> 00:16.050
to the premiere of
the new "Star Wars" movie.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.885
Their phones open
at 10:00 a.m.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.588
First caller gets the tickets.
JJ is gonna get them.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.790
Maya, the flier says that
the giveaway was Tuesday,

00:22.890 --> 00:24.024
so...yesterday.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.294
Oh, no.
It already happened.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.461
Oh, I'm so sorry, JJ.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.463
It looks like somebody already
got those tickets.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.565
Me!

00:31.665 --> 00:32.566
(laughs)

00:32.666 --> 00:33.734
Mom, you got them?

00:33.834 --> 00:34.735
That's amazing!

00:34.835 --> 00:36.104
And the way
you announced it --

00:36.204 --> 00:37.705
you have a real flair
for the dramatic.

00:37.805 --> 00:38.706
Do I?

00:38.806 --> 00:40.874
(choir vocalizing)

00:40.974 --> 00:43.311
We're going to "Star Wars"!

00:43.411 --> 00:44.745
"Not so fast.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.214
Who should I take?"

00:46.314 --> 00:48.048
Oh, don't tease me
like that.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.950
We've seen every "Star Wars"
movie together,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.752
and you know
I'm the biggest fan here.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.122
"Let's put that
to the test."

00:54.222 --> 00:56.724
Ooh, a family quiz
that also tortures Ray.

00:56.824 --> 00:57.725
I'm in.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.761
TAYLOR: "Dad, this"...
S-P -- "space station

01:00.861 --> 01:03.397
blew up at the end
of the first movie."

01:03.497 --> 01:05.333
The Death Star.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.401
Everyone knows that.
I didn't.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.503
I've never seen
"Star Wars."

01:09.603 --> 01:12.406
What? What kind of person
has never seen "Star Wars"?

01:12.506 --> 01:14.308
Ooh, make a thing out of this.
I want to watch.

01:14.408 --> 01:18.279
"Dylan, Chew-bake-a
is a 'blank.'"

01:18.379 --> 01:19.913
Awesome dude.
Correct.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.982
No! The correct answer
is "wookiee."

01:22.082 --> 01:23.851
You don't think Chewbacca's
an awesome dude?

01:23.951 --> 01:26.019
And you want to bring this guy
to the premiere?

01:26.120 --> 01:27.955
(sighs)
"Mom, fill in the blank.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.857
May the 'blank'
be with you."

01:29.957 --> 01:32.360
"Star Wars."
"Close enough."

01:32.460 --> 01:34.828
We're done.
We all know I'm going with you.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.864
I refuse to let you
torture me.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.166
I'm not gonna dance
for you.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.301
"Or...dance for me."

01:40.401 --> 01:43.504
**

01:43.604 --> 01:44.605
Look away, Taylor.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.677
We need to talk about
how this family wields power.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.781
**

01:53.881 --> 01:56.850
Hello?! Is anyone here?!

01:56.950 --> 01:58.286
JJ forgot his notebook,

01:58.386 --> 02:00.120
and I'm just here
to pick it up for him!

02:00.221 --> 02:02.456
**

02:02.556 --> 02:03.857
Aaahhhhh!

02:03.957 --> 02:06.294
I fell and broke my leg!

02:06.394 --> 02:09.029
Oh, please help me!

02:10.564 --> 02:12.566
(chuckles)

02:12.666 --> 02:14.735
I'm gonna need backup.

02:14.835 --> 02:18.339
The old groundskeeper
kept his keys.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.840
Looks like he's about to enjoy

02:19.940 --> 02:21.975
all of the school's amenities.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.544
(laughs)

02:23.644 --> 02:27.848
Oh, he's getting the same
workout he did in his old gym,

02:27.948 --> 02:28.882
but for free.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.883
Ah!

02:29.983 --> 02:31.018
Come quick!

02:31.118 --> 02:32.720
He's turned on all the showers,

02:32.820 --> 02:35.155
and it's a steam room now!

02:35.256 --> 02:37.491
He's eating froyo,
and it's a lot

02:37.591 --> 02:39.727
because there's no one here
to judge him.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.929
(laughing)
I'm starting to think

02:42.029 --> 02:44.432
this guy's never gonna
get caught!

02:44.532 --> 02:47.768
(laughs evilly)

02:48.769 --> 02:50.604
JIMMY: Morning, JJ.
MAYA: Morning, darling.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.840
"I was"... T-H --
"thinking

02:52.940 --> 02:54.942
it would be fun
to take a car to the"...

02:55.042 --> 02:56.176
P-R -- "premiere."

02:57.545 --> 02:57.678
I don't know, sweetheart.
I'm more comfortable
with driving you.

02:58.045 --> 02:58.679
"I'd pay."

02:59.413 --> 02:59.947
Oh, go nuts.
Have a nice ride.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.449
"Sound good?"

03:01.549 --> 03:02.916
So, you are taking me?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.051
(R2-D2 beeps)

03:04.151 --> 03:06.220
And you're answering
in R2-D2?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.188
"We'll have to leave
at 4:00."

03:08.289 --> 03:10.724
Oh, 4:00 no worky.
I have plans.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.527
"Let me guess --
with Taylor?"

03:13.627 --> 03:15.929
And her brother Logan,
who you hate.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.799
Dylan!
Provocateur's
gonna provocatoo.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.302
Are you sure you're okay
with not going?

03:21.402 --> 03:22.470
Are you kidding me?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.737
It'll be great to have them
out of the house.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.974
One requires so much attention
and has all these needs.

03:27.074 --> 03:27.941
And then there's JJ.

03:28.041 --> 03:28.976
She has a point.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.077
It's never just
the three of us,

03:30.177 --> 03:32.313
and those guys dictate
a lot of what we do.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.482
It'll be fun!
We'll do exactly what we want,

03:34.582 --> 03:36.384
just Mum, Dad,
and Dylan.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.918
You guys can call it
Mom-Da-Dyl night!

03:38.018 --> 03:39.487
It's our night. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
We don't need a name.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.954
Bye.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.491
(school bell rings)

03:43.591 --> 03:45.326
Excuse me, everyone.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.495
I have some
very disturbing news.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.298
Last night, our dear school
was violated

03:50.398 --> 03:52.099
by an act of vandalism.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.667
The perpetrators
gained entry,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.903
accessed
the frozen-yogurt machine,

03:56.003 --> 03:58.572
and left it running,
which ruined the floor.

03:58.672 --> 04:02.843
Sadly, he or she was wily enough
to avoid our security cameras.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.313
(quietly)
Security cameras?

04:05.413 --> 04:07.915
Be very careful.
If you encounter this vandal,

04:08.015 --> 04:10.351
please, don't be a hero.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.920
Let them do...
whatever they want to you.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.125
Dr. Miller,
don't freak out.
What?

04:18.225 --> 04:21.362
There was no vandal.
I did it.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.596
W-Wha-What do you mean?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.765
I still have my keys from
when I was a groundskeeper,

04:24.865 --> 04:27.167
and I come here
at night sometimes.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.702
It's a good hang.

04:28.802 --> 04:29.970
My gym fees went up,

04:30.070 --> 04:32.640
and so I started to work out
here after hours.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.141
Could I please
keep the keys?

04:34.241 --> 04:37.445
Nobody has ever said my school's
a "good hang" before.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.013
I put so much work into it,
and finally someone cares.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.850
Kenneth, you come back
any time you want.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.953
Just...you be more careful,
you old froyo hound.

04:46.053 --> 04:46.987
(chuckles)

04:48.522 --> 04:50.190
What are you staring at?

04:51.158 --> 04:52.793
India Herzfeld?

04:52.893 --> 04:54.528
I heard she has
a modeling contract,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.497
and there's a billboard of her
in Tokyo,

04:56.597 --> 05:00.000
and everyone who drives by it
gets in a car crash and dies.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.636
She saw us staring.
Look away.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.407
(sighs)
Even her shadow's hot.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.142
Nice shirt.
How did you get it?

05:09.242 --> 05:11.345
"It came with my tickets
to the"...

05:11.445 --> 05:12.480
P-R -- "premiere."

05:12.580 --> 05:14.314
You're going
to the premiere?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.517
I would give anything
to go to that premiere.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.353
**

05:19.453 --> 05:20.354
RAY: Mom!

05:20.454 --> 05:22.155
JJ, that is a jerk move.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.491
You promised the ticket
to Ray.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.058
Ha. See?

05:25.158 --> 05:28.896
But I did give you the tickets,
so the choice is yours.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.431
But you really got
to ask yourself,

05:30.531 --> 05:34.001
when you look back,
will you feel good about --

05:34.101 --> 05:35.403
Will you let me
finish the sentence?

05:35.503 --> 05:37.771
So, you're gonna go alone
with this stranger?

05:37.871 --> 05:39.206
What if she needs
to help you?

05:39.306 --> 05:40.908
I haven't seen
her Japanese billboard,

05:41.008 --> 05:43.744
but I'm pretty sure
she's not giving a guy
a bathroom transfer.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.779
Oh, Japan is weird.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.616
"So, I won't drink.
Worth it."

05:48.716 --> 05:50.718
So that's it?
I just get cast aside

05:50.818 --> 05:52.686
for the first gorgeous
international model

05:52.786 --> 05:53.687
that comes around?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.723
I'm very dateable.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.091
Ask Taylor.
Or Mom!

05:58.191 --> 05:59.893
Aw.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.430
All right, let's have a look
at this India Herzfeld.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.599
Ooh, yeah, no, I get it.
Yep, yep, yep.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.236
My own brother, tossing me aside
like a piece of garbage.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.539
And it's "Star Wars."
So sad.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.874
How would you know?
You've never even seen it.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.877
I'm sorry. I'm lashing out.
But watch it soon.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.646
Why don't you try to go?
How?

06:18.746 --> 06:20.948
JJ got the hookup through
a cerebral palsy group.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.115
What am I supposed to do?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.284
Find someone else with
cerebral palsy to take me?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.986
**

06:26.086 --> 06:28.922
Ohh, that would
drive JJ crazy.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.491
Hey, Logan.
Do you like "Star Wars"?

06:30.591 --> 06:33.326
I like screwing over JJ.
That works.

06:35.896 --> 06:36.997
MAYA: This is fun,
just us three.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.600
I've always wanted to express
my artistic side,

06:39.700 --> 06:40.668
but there's never time.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.736
Also, Ray would never let you
paint the curb red

06:42.836 --> 06:44.838
so people can't park
in front of the house.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.239
He shouldn't have gone out.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.175
You know, I'm starting to take
some pride in this place.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.843
I just wish every house
on the block

06:49.943 --> 06:52.179
didn't have a nicer mailbox
than ours, you know?

06:52.279 --> 06:54.414
Why can't you say
"The Fredricksons"

06:54.515 --> 06:55.783
in a nice red script?

06:55.883 --> 06:58.018
Well, if you'd take your turn,
we could do that next.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.820
Nah, your guys' stuff
is more fun.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.421
Besides,
this thing's fine.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.460
I defy you to find a mailbox
with better timing.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.831
**

07:10.931 --> 07:13.166
(R2-D2 beeping)

07:15.268 --> 07:16.837
RAY: Here it goes.
Wish me luck.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.007
Let me handle this.
I've got a way with people.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.543
Work your magic.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.677
Yeah, give us tickets.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.112
I can't do that.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.814
Well, no luck.
Let's get tacos.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.517
(beeping)

07:29.617 --> 07:32.620
Oh, JJ.
You're looking well.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.055
"What are you doing here?"
I'm here with Logan.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.190
**

07:37.290 --> 07:38.992
We're already having
a lovely time.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.728
We were just on our way
to get tacos.

07:40.828 --> 07:41.895
After!

07:41.995 --> 07:44.164
(both laugh)

07:46.199 --> 07:48.035
Thank you
for bringing me here.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.872
Oh, right.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.574
Maybe there's a ramp?

07:53.674 --> 07:58.078
**

07:58.178 --> 08:02.149
(beeping)

08:02.249 --> 08:04.552
JJ, over here.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.754
(beeping)

08:09.222 --> 08:11.191
(squeals)

08:11.291 --> 08:12.693
(beeps)

08:12.793 --> 08:17.998
**

08:18.098 --> 08:19.900
He drives down the lane.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.169
He shoots...and he scores!

08:22.269 --> 08:24.538
Oh, and the crowd
goes wild!
(screams)

08:24.638 --> 08:25.539
Oh!

08:25.639 --> 08:26.874
What are you doing here?!

08:26.974 --> 08:28.108
I'm here to watch.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.678
Well, you said Lafayette
was a "good hang."

08:30.778 --> 08:32.713
I want to see what that means,
so just act like I'm not here.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.114
But you are.

08:34.214 --> 08:38.018
Well, it's only fair, Kenneth.
I did let you keep the keys.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.519
Have fun.
Bounce your ball.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.589
Uh...

08:41.689 --> 08:44.792
Yeah, I don't think this works
with you standing right there.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.093
I understand.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.696
I-I'll just go watch on the
security cameras in my office.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.931
Uh...

08:51.031 --> 08:54.902
**

08:55.002 --> 08:58.371
JIMMY (breathless):
Uh, that's a (sighs)

08:58.471 --> 08:59.640
fun run, Dylan.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.974
(breathless) That's how fast you
normally run, is it?

09:01.074 --> 09:03.076
(laughing)
Oh, Mom, Dad.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.079
You work so hard
to be funny.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.380
She's funny!

09:07.480 --> 09:09.149
I wasn't trying to be funny.
"Work so hard"?

09:09.249 --> 09:11.985
Okay, then. Dad's turn next.
What should we do?

09:12.085 --> 09:15.723
Huh.
What do I...want to do?

09:15.823 --> 09:17.290
I got nothing.
You guys choose.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.727
Dylan and I have gone
three times. You pick.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.995
Uh...seriously,
I'm down for whatever.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.164
No, don't say "whatever."
Oh, Jimmy, okay.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.666
Try this.
Close your eyes.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.169
Now, you can do anything
you want in the whole world.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.638
Just pick something.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.440
And you're having fun.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.008
What are you doing?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.778
**

09:37.878 --> 09:39.279
Whatever.
Oh, bloody hell, Jimmy.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.447
Hey, listen.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.115
You guys figure out
what we're gonna do.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.685
Think of me as
the family genie.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.921
With a budget
of like six bucks.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.489
I'll find out
what he wants.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.625
Give me 10 minutes alone
with him and full immunity.

09:51.725 --> 09:55.495
No. I gave you full immunity
once before. Never again.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.666
And I know things he wants,
but I think we've broken him.

09:58.766 --> 09:59.967
I mean, he gives
and he gives,

10:00.067 --> 10:01.669
but he won't take anything
for himself.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.271
We just have to find a way
of giving it to him

10:04.371 --> 10:05.372
without him knowing.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.374
You can do that?
Oh, yeah.

10:07.474 --> 10:08.976
It's how I got
a second car.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.277
And a third kid!

10:10.377 --> 10:12.012
(triumphant music plays)

10:12.112 --> 10:13.981
RAY: All right,
follow my lead.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.484
Hi. We're here to pick up
our VIP passes.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.052
I'm actually in the movie.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.053
Who do you play?

10:20.153 --> 10:21.554
Oh, they had us
sign something,

10:21.655 --> 10:22.890
so I can't tell you.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.892
Nice try, though.
Pretty tricky.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.159
Next!

10:26.259 --> 10:28.028
Excuse me.
Kevin Smith, please.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.196
Mr. Smith.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.799
Can you please help us get in?
We are huge fans.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.867
Oh!
Of him? Who is he?

10:33.967 --> 10:34.835
(chuckling) Oh, my Lord.

10:35.803 --> 10:36.536
You are so much better at this
than he is.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.039
I would like to get these boys
into the premiere.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.007
Is that possible?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.574
Of course, Mr. Smith.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.176
Thank you.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.178
That's called using
the Force.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.479
(laughs)

10:46.579 --> 10:47.748
What are you laughing for?

10:47.848 --> 10:49.917
Because you said
the Force is real.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.184
The Force is real.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.687
That's why people give me
nice things all the time.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.055
Why else
would they do that?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.057
Because you're
a famous director?

10:58.525 --> 11:01.328
Can I get two goodie bags
for these young Jedis?

11:01.428 --> 11:04.331
Thank you.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.700
(sarcastically) Because
I'm a famous director.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.568
* Star Wars

11:08.668 --> 11:10.403
Hey, I know you!

11:10.503 --> 11:12.672
So, Dad,
we thought about it,

11:12.773 --> 11:14.007
and there are
a couple more things

11:14.107 --> 11:16.043
we would love to do.
Yeah? Like what?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.211
Like listen to these vinyl
punk rock records.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.512
Since when
did you like punk?

11:19.612 --> 11:22.082
Oh, well, I mean,
I grew up in London,

11:22.182 --> 11:24.752
and so we sort of
invented it.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.853
Yeah, well, you know,

11:25.953 --> 11:27.187
Joey Ramone
and the city of Detroit

11:27.287 --> 11:28.521
might beg to differ,
but...

11:28.621 --> 11:30.357
Well, you know,
perhaps you could teach us

11:30.457 --> 11:33.761
all about the punk
whilst we listen to it.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.262
(punk rock music plays)
Could you?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.630
Yeah.
Oh, goody.

11:37.731 --> 11:40.067
Oh. I had no idea you guys
were into this.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.269
I said Detroit mainly
because of the MC5.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.871
I'll turn it up,
shall I?

11:43.971 --> 11:46.039
Eight years on the Sex Pistols,
with all due respect.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.975
* I'm damaged beyond repair

11:48.075 --> 11:51.478
Do you want some?
There are two straws.

11:51.578 --> 11:56.249
(romantic music plays)

11:58.251 --> 12:00.453
JJ, look.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.222
Hi, Captain Phasma.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.758
(dramatic music plays)

12:04.858 --> 12:07.995
Oh, you're just wearing the suit
for the premiere,

12:08.095 --> 12:09.062
and you're not
supposed to talk?

12:09.162 --> 12:12.065
(dramatic music plays)

12:12.165 --> 12:14.935
"Hey, I can't talk,
either."

12:15.035 --> 12:17.604
(dramatic music plays)

12:17.704 --> 12:19.306
RAY: Oh, hey, JJ.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.740
Want to play a little more
"Star Wars" trivia?

12:20.841 --> 12:26.579
Which DiMeo brother gets to sit
in the VIP section?

12:26.679 --> 12:29.016
Hint, hint.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.450
May the Force
be with you...

12:30.550 --> 12:32.752
if it reaches back here.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.122
Come on, Logan.

12:35.222 --> 12:39.292
**

12:39.392 --> 12:43.864
"Would you like to go
on a mission?"

12:44.965 --> 12:47.467

12:47.567 --> 12:52.840
**

12:52.940 --> 12:58.311
**

12:58.411 --> 13:00.647
DR. MILLER: How are you liking
your frozen yogurt?

13:00.747 --> 13:01.882
It's fine!

13:01.982 --> 13:05.318
Kenneth, I can't hear you.
These cameras don't have sound.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.555
Could you act out how the froyo
makes you feel?

13:09.656 --> 13:11.992
Oh.
I can't do this!

13:12.092 --> 13:14.661
I can't enjoy myself
while I'm being watched.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.196
It's the main reason
why I got cut

13:16.296 --> 13:17.530
from "Big Brother"
so early.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.033
That, and Sean needed to stop
using my body wash.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.402
I'm just gonna go.
No, Kenneth.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.837
Uh, please.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.006
I-I finally found someone
who appreciates this place.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.075
I'm gonna leave
before I spoil that.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.477
Oh.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.745
I-If you type 2-1-2-1
into the vending machine,

13:32.846 --> 13:34.714
everything's free.

(laser blasts firing)

13:41.454 --> 13:48.028
**

13:50.864 --> 13:53.333
Excuse me.
I'm kind of a VIP.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.168
I can't really see anything.

13:55.268 --> 13:59.572
**

13:59.672 --> 14:03.944
**

14:04.044 --> 14:07.180
I think
I've seen this before.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.182
It's the premiere.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.051
**

14:11.151 --> 14:14.454
* It's gonna be okay

14:14.554 --> 14:16.689
Thanks, Dad. I've missed
dancing on your feet

14:16.789 --> 14:17.624
like a little girl.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.027
Hey, anything for you.
(clears throat)

14:20.127 --> 14:22.629
(whispers) I fixed
the mailbox. What's next?

14:22.729 --> 14:23.863
Maybe we should have
a family jam.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.798
You bought me those drums
a long time ago,

14:25.899 --> 14:27.034
and I've never played them.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.569
But now I really want to learn
how to smack the tubs.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.405
Yeah! We could cover
your old punk band's songs.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.573
You guys were so good.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.408
What's going on here?

14:35.508 --> 14:36.776
The father-daughter dance,

14:36.876 --> 14:39.546
the obviously Googled
drum slang.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.548
You guys have turned
Mom-Dad-Dyl night

14:41.648 --> 14:42.950
into Jimmy Night.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.385
What? No. (groans)

14:45.485 --> 14:47.120
I knew I shouldn't have said
his band was good.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.956
Guys,
I don't need all this.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.790
Yeah, but you deserve it.
Don't quit now.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.725
We got one more surprise
for you, out by the curb.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.895
(punk rock music plays)

14:55.996 --> 14:57.664
Get ready
to be surprised.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.933
You're gonna love it.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.434
Oh, my God!

15:01.534 --> 15:02.735
Oh, it's nothing.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.271
Oh!

15:04.371 --> 15:08.008
I would hardly call
a '62 Falcon "nothing"!

15:08.108 --> 15:09.242
A '62 what now?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.477
Oh, ho, ho!

15:10.577 --> 15:12.079
Oh, no, Jimmy.
Dad, wait.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.014
I-I know I said
I didn't want anything,

15:14.114 --> 15:15.348
but, oh, my God.
(engine starts)

15:15.448 --> 15:17.817
Wait, wait. No, Jimmy,
there's been a mistake.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.987
I know.
You parked in the red zone.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.454
Let me fix that!

15:21.554 --> 15:22.822
Oh!
Hey, hey, hey!

15:22.922 --> 15:24.424
Hey!

15:24.524 --> 15:27.494
And it's full of pizzas?!
You guys!

15:30.797 --> 15:33.600
The only reason
why I'm sitting here...

15:33.700 --> 15:36.003
(people shushing)
...is because these are
the last two accessible seats

15:36.103 --> 15:37.837
not being blocked
by your 8-foot goon friend.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.806
You're ruining this.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.043
"My girl here
doesn't think so."

15:43.143 --> 15:44.644
She's not your girlfriend.

15:44.744 --> 15:45.645
(shushing continues)

15:45.745 --> 15:47.380
"Oh, yeah?
Watch this."

15:47.480 --> 15:49.149
Oh, sure.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.187
JJ.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.391
I think I'm gonna
get popcorn.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.993
"Allow me."

16:02.795 --> 16:05.298
Stop it.
Stop it!

16:05.398 --> 16:07.367
My date said to stop it.

**

16:14.741 --> 16:16.909
Fight!
Loser buys tacos.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.512
An Emma Watson cameo?

16:20.913 --> 16:21.881
(audience yelling)

16:21.981 --> 16:24.651
Nothing can stop me now!

16:25.385 --> 16:28.255
Why did they give us lightsabers
if they don't want this?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.157
**

16:32.925 --> 16:35.695
Wow, you must have paid
a fortune for this.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.230
Actually, she did not.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.167
No, No, listen, I love
how tickled you are by this,

16:40.267 --> 16:42.369
and you do deserve it,
but that said, the --

16:42.469 --> 16:44.204
(siren wailing)

16:44.304 --> 16:45.705
OFFICER:
Pull over to the side.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.707
I'm not speeding.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.610
Probably thinks a guy like me
couldn't own a car this cool.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.215
I don't own a car this cool,
do I?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.016
We're also on the hook
for the pizza.

16:59.752 --> 17:03.022
(lightsabers humming,
clashing)

17:11.664 --> 17:14.867
Ugh. What now?

clashing)

17:17.737 --> 17:20.807
**

17:20.907 --> 17:24.944
"P...P...P."

17:27.214 --> 17:29.949
Really? Now?
Shh!

17:34.954 --> 17:36.489
I got to go help JJ.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.725
(clanks)
Imperial stooge.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.962
Dr. Miller.
Dr. Miller, don't go.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.898
Oh, it's fine, Kenneth.
Have your fun.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.901
Oh, I will.
And you'll enjoy it.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.071
Let me show you my
your Lafayette.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.507
I call it
Lafayette After Dark.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.810

17:57.910 --> 17:58.945
* Yeah! Do the boogaloo

17:59.045 --> 18:00.513
You sure you just
want a small?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.149
It's perfect.

Okay.

It splits!

18:15.262 --> 18:16.529
The end.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.865
This is one
of my favorite spots.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.533
Some view.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.335
Why are they up there,
anyway?

18:22.435 --> 18:26.506
Well, I just figured there'd be
something to celebrate one day.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.542
But, man,
are we bad at sports.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.278
Well, those kids
might not appreciate you

18:31.378 --> 18:33.846
the way that they should,
but I do.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.283
And maybe after tonight,
you will, too.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.886
I'll eat free vending-machine
snacks to that.

18:39.986 --> 18:44.157
**

18:46.326 --> 18:49.362
"Thank you
for helping me."

18:49.462 --> 18:52.332
Yeah, sure.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.301
You should have just
taken me.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.203
"Star Wars" is our thing.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.637
We'd watch
all the movies,

18:57.737 --> 18:59.239
then we talk about
our favorite scenes

18:59.339 --> 19:01.641
and have
lightsaber fights.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.410
But then you ditched me
for a girl.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.848
"You ditched me
for a girl first."

19:08.948 --> 19:12.985
What? Are you jealous
that I have Taylor?

19:13.085 --> 19:14.921
"No, dummy.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.857
I'm jealous
that Taylor has you."

19:20.193 --> 19:21.661
"All your time."

19:22.929 --> 19:24.331
You want time with me?

19:25.665 --> 19:26.933
Do you...

19:27.033 --> 19:28.701
Do you like me?

19:29.869 --> 19:32.205
"Don't make me
make you say it."

19:34.040 --> 19:37.410
Let's see it again.
Together.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.347
"It's a date."
Okay, this is good.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.849
Let's promise that
from this day forward,

19:42.949 --> 19:44.717
no woman
will get between us.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.720
Forget the girls.
The brothers come first.

19:47.820 --> 19:52.392
"Let's just say we both like
'Star Wars.'"

19:52.492 --> 19:54.894
Yeah,
that feels easier.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.729
Thanks for the ride!

19:58.898 --> 20:01.934
Why didn't you just tell me
the car wasn't for me?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.636
'Cause you were so happy
and we really wanted

20:03.736 --> 20:05.572
to give you
something you wanted.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.873
And after you'd
seen the car,

20:06.973 --> 20:08.908
well, the dumb mailbox wasn't
really gonna measure up.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.744
Oh!
Look at our mailbox!

20:13.580 --> 20:17.216
I wanted this,
and I got it.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.318
Feels good.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.619
From now on,
I'm gonna be better

20:19.719 --> 20:22.655
about figuring out what I want
and asking for it.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.123
And I'll tell you
more clearly

20:24.223 --> 20:26.158
when you're about to
steal a car.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.429
And I learned that
getting arrested isn't so bad.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.797
(crash in distance)

20:30.897 --> 20:33.600
**

20:33.700 --> 20:35.902
(lightsabers humming)

20:38.104 --> 20:40.607
The Force is strong with you,
but you have much to learn!

20:40.707 --> 20:42.475
Ah!
(grunts)

20:42.575 --> 20:43.843
Aww, is there
any force greater

20:43.943 --> 20:45.912
than the love
between brothers?

20:46.012 --> 20:50.450
**

20:50.550 --> 20:52.118
Okay, probably time
to step in.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.525
The water pressure in
the fountains is great today,

20:58.625 --> 21:00.460
Dr. Miller.
Thank you, Ray.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.161
And the froyo rocks.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.663
Wait. What's going on?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.765
(all chanting "Miller")

21:07.767 --> 21:10.937
Well...Dr. Miller.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.005
I know you're waiting on
something big to happen,

21:13.105 --> 21:15.708
but this school has always had
something to celebrate.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.976
Aww.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.980
(all groan)

21:21.080 --> 21:22.148
Guess it's been
a little while

21:22.248 --> 21:24.817
since I had the balloon drop
installed.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.218
Cool, a dead bird!

21:26.319 --> 21:28.955
