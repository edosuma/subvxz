<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:11.990 --> 00:12.990
<i>I just got married,</i>

00:13.151 --> 00:14.551
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

00:14.732 --> 00:16.332
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:16.884 --> 00:18.184
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:19.676 --> 00:23.926
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

00:24.907 --> 00:26.057
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

00:26.122 --> 00:28.522
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

00:28.620 --> 00:32.171
<i>the ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living,</i>

00:32.174 --> 00:33.670

00:56.735 --> 00:59.583
Everything is for sale except the buddha and those two paintings.

00:59.580 --> 01:01.528
We don't really have room for all of this in the store,

01:01.529 --> 01:04.711
so we thought that maybe we would take some pictures and sell the larger items online.

01:04.717 --> 01:06.070
That sounds fine. Excuse me.

01:06.078 --> 01:08.320
Hello? Oh, hey, Roger. Can you hold on one second?

01:08.325 --> 01:09.770
Can I show you the upstairs?

01:10.036 --> 01:11.511
Hello? No, I can't.

01:12.015 --> 01:13.160
3:00 is the latest.

01:14.126 --> 01:16.373
Well, then it'll have to be when I get back.

01:16.765 --> 01:18.713
All right, Roger. Let me know. Thanks.

01:19.025 --> 01:22.722
You know, I hate to even suggest this, but maybe you'd be better off with

01:22.838 --> 01:25.083
an established auction house like Sotheby's.

01:25.226 --> 01:27.323
Well, I don't have the time for all that.

01:27.367 --> 01:29.252
And actually, I'd rather do it locally.

01:29.258 --> 01:30.580
You know, support main street.

01:30.586 --> 01:33.683
Well, we're thrilled. It's just a little more inventory than we're used to.

01:33.685 --> 01:34.580
You'll do fine.

01:35.098 --> 01:36.833
You know, this is an amazing house.

01:36.836 --> 01:38.930
Do you mind me asking why you're leaving?

01:40.258 --> 01:42.303
I just felt like I needed a fresh start,

01:43.077 --> 01:45.321
and I wanted to be closer to my main office.

01:49.036 --> 01:50.381
Did you wanna see the baby?

01:50.386 --> 01:51.632
- Is it ok?
- Oh, sure.

01:51.756 --> 01:54.753
I've given up on Jessie napping anytime in the next decade.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.423
She's so cute.

01:59.748 --> 02:01.983
She's a joy. She's been a very easy baby.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.471
Oh! Excuse me.

02:06.078 --> 02:07.220
Hey. What's happening?

02:13.605 --> 02:14.503
Yeah. What's up?

02:15.248 --> 02:16.643
No, I'm still in Grandview.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.061
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Who are you?

02:30.546 --> 02:34.390
I'm Andrea Moreno. I'm cataloguing Christine's antiques so we can sell them.

02:35.006 --> 02:36.702
Do I look like an antique to you?

02:37.836 --> 02:38.732
No.

02:39.286 --> 02:40.931
Well, you picked the wrong door.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.471
Right.

02:42.776 --> 02:43.672
Well...

02:43.686 --> 02:44.701
I'll just be going now.

02:44.705 --> 02:47.102
Don't tell Christine you saw the nanny smoking.

02:47.337 --> 02:48.233
Promise I won't.

03:15.415 --> 03:16.313
Melinda.

03:18.635 --> 03:19.541
What are you doing?

03:19.545 --> 03:20.493
The door was open.

03:21.605 --> 03:23.441
Nothing in this room is for sale.

03:26.128 --> 03:28.890
Why don't we head over to my office? I have great fifties furniture.

03:28.896 --> 03:30.143
Cool. I love that stuff.

04:04.007 --> 04:08.001

04:12.968 --> 04:15.311
We are in completely over our heads right now.

04:15.545 --> 04:17.411
I know. But I am loving it.

04:17.846 --> 04:21.380
Can you imagine if we sell all this stuff, plus the stuff we have on online?

04:21.385 --> 04:23.430
Yeah. Sotheby's will be recommending us.

04:24.657 --> 04:26.363
God. Christine is unbelievable.

04:27.227 --> 04:28.271
I love her taste.

04:29.975 --> 04:31.492
Do you find her a little intimidating?

04:31.496 --> 04:33.491
No, I find her to be surprisingly nice.

04:33.877 --> 04:36.112
Hmm. Maybe it's because I've worn her clothes and

04:36.126 --> 04:39.643
read all these magazine articles about her, but I find her a little larger than life.

04:39.645 --> 04:40.791
You've read about her?

04:41.296 --> 04:42.841
Do you know if she lost a son?

04:43.506 --> 04:45.441
I don't remember reading anything about that.

04:45.447 --> 04:47.831
'Cause there was a boy's room on the second floor, just

04:47.836 --> 04:48.733
no boy.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.983
Well, she's divorced. Maybe he's with the husband.

04:51.985 --> 04:53.341
No, there was a presence

04:53.857 --> 04:54.723
there.

04:54.726 --> 04:56.640
No spirit, but his toys came alive.

04:57.955 --> 05:00.540
I'm assuming not in a cute Pixar, Toy Story kind of way.

05:00.548 --> 05:01.442
Ah, no.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.301
It was

05:02.307 --> 05:03.202
menacing.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.071
Wow. What do you think he wants?

05:05.076 --> 05:07.191
I don't know. I'll have to go back and see him later.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.100
Well, my advice:

05:08.208 --> 05:10.911
Stay away from the nanny, 'cause that chick's a little off.

05:10.915 --> 05:14.041
This is so sad. I'm just trying to catch a glimpse of my husband.

05:14.048 --> 05:15.481
You didn't see him this morning?

05:15.486 --> 05:16.783
He left before I woke up.

05:17.146 --> 05:18.972
Why don't you go on over and say hi?

05:18.978 --> 05:21.653
'Cause I don't want to bug him while he's at work. Besides,

05:21.658 --> 05:24.363
he promised that he'd get off early and make me a romantic dinner.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.460
Ok, you just completely lost my sympathy.

05:26.885 --> 05:28.981
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Hi. Can I help you?

05:33.426 --> 05:34.573
Hi. Is Christine here?

05:34.627 --> 05:36.430
Uh, no. She's out of town. She'll be back tomorrow night.

05:36.438 --> 05:38.651
She was supposed to have left some boxes for me.

05:38.657 --> 05:40.141
Oh, yeah, yeah! Come on in.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.061
I left the baby in the kitchen.

05:46.395 --> 05:48.161
Hi, sweetheart!

05:49.067 --> 05:50.443
Are you having your lunch?

05:50.606 --> 05:51.610
Oh! Sweet potatoes.

05:51.838 --> 05:52.732
My favorite.

05:53.566 --> 05:55.091
She seems so good-natured.

05:55.696 --> 05:56.901
Most of the time, yes.

05:57.575 --> 06:00.470
But she can howl like a banshee when she wants something.

06:01.237 --> 06:02.562
How long have you worked for Christine?

06:02.568 --> 06:03.710
Oh, just a few months.

06:04.377 --> 06:06.203
The last nanny quit with no notice.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.542
Do you know why Christine is leaving town?

06:09.545 --> 06:11.520
She told me that she missed the city.

06:12.148 --> 06:14.741
You were right. So she can be closer to her office.

06:15.987 --> 06:19.030
Well, there are a lot of bad memories for her in this house.

06:20.427 --> 06:21.422
Painful memories.

06:25.845 --> 06:27.240
Uh, memories about her son?

06:28.405 --> 06:29.761
She told you about Daniel?

06:31.286 --> 06:32.112
Well, I...

06:32.116 --> 06:35.091
saw the room. She wouldn't let me go in, so I assumed that's something...

06:35.095 --> 06:37.072
I mean, losing a child?

06:39.085 --> 06:39.982
I don't know.

06:40.126 --> 06:42.320
I don't know how anybody ever gets over it.

06:43.706 --> 06:45.381
I don't think you do get over it.

06:45.398 --> 06:48.541
I think you just do what Christine's doing and try to move on.

06:48.887 --> 06:50.902
Yeah. Well, her husband had no trouble moving on.

06:50.906 --> 06:53.760
He took a job in Japan right after their second child was born.

06:53.765 --> 06:55.731
It was divorce by Fedex, I think.

06:56.336 --> 06:57.630
What happened to the boy?

06:58.725 --> 06:59.620
Shut up!

07:04.095 --> 07:04.991
Are you ok?

07:05.086 --> 07:08.032
There are lot of strange things that happen in this house.

07:08.145 --> 07:09.042
Yeah.

07:09.526 --> 07:10.973
I'm getting that impression.

07:15.297 --> 07:16.240
Where are you?

07:28.005 --> 07:28.902
Hello?

07:32.185 --> 07:33.330
Let the romance begin.

07:35.147 --> 07:36.060
Hmm? Oh.

07:37.185 --> 07:38.273
Hey, gorgeous.

07:38.967 --> 07:39.861
Come here.

07:40.657 --> 07:42.402
I was just about to start cooking.

07:42.517 --> 07:45.013
- Yeah, you seem really motivated.
- I'll rally.

07:45.025 --> 07:46.773
You know what? This is ridiculous.

07:47.655 --> 07:50.400
Why don't you get somebody else to start taking some of bobby's shifts?

07:50.408 --> 07:52.100
Well, the truth is I volunteered.

07:52.608 --> 07:53.500
Why?

07:53.721 --> 07:56.522
I'm just trying to sock away some real money from that.

07:56.595 --> 07:58.193
- For what?
- The future.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.698
All right.

07:59.699 --> 08:01.421
I'm fully awake. I'm completely alert.

08:01.428 --> 08:02.781
Hey! Do you want me to make dinner?

08:02.785 --> 08:04.183
I lied. I must be dreaming.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.913
You know what? I'm starting to like cooking.

08:06.926 --> 08:10.543
If you weren't always hogging the kitchen, maybe I would get some practice.

08:10.545 --> 08:11.891
What do you want to drink.

08:12.075 --> 08:12.973
Beer is good.

08:14.967 --> 08:17.012
Remember that customer I told you about?

08:17.348 --> 08:18.443
The fashion designer?

08:19.585 --> 08:21.661
Her kid died and I saw him today.

08:23.427 --> 08:24.160
Jim!

08:24.168 --> 08:25.031
Huh! Oh.

08:25.037 --> 08:25.933
What?

08:26.245 --> 08:27.571
I was just-- I was, um...

08:27.756 --> 08:29.070
trying to memorize, uh,

08:29.275 --> 08:31.670
the placement of all the furniture in the room.

08:32.078 --> 08:32.970
I'm awake.

08:34.158 --> 08:35.371
I'm really very awake.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.309
Let the machine get it.

08:42.538 --> 08:43.429
Hello?

08:43.938 --> 08:45.180
Who's watching the baby?

08:48.055 --> 08:48.953
Hey. Hey.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.370
You all right? Dinner? No?

08:50.647 --> 08:51.542
I'm sorry.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.563
- Can I help?
- I don't know. I love you.

08:56.616 --> 08:57.513
I love you, too.

09:00.655 --> 09:01.552
Dammit!

09:07.617 --> 09:08.512
Yeah.

09:09.557 --> 09:10.450
The baby's fine.

09:10.538 --> 09:11.853
It's the mother.

09:12.246 --> 09:14.140
God. She treats me like I'm her wife.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.931
Yeah. She's got me doing the grocery shopping, picking up her dry cleaning.

09:18.936 --> 09:19.893
If she asked me to

09:20.845 --> 09:24.471
get her a cuban cigar and a foot massage, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

09:24.488 --> 09:25.932
No. Listen, the baby's fine.

09:26.437 --> 09:27.633
The place is beautiful.

09:52.387 --> 09:53.971
She promised me!

09:57.606 --> 09:58.752
Hang on. The baby's crying.

09:58.758 --> 10:00.803
Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.

10:16.538 --> 10:17.430
Shh, shh, shh.

10:21.015 --> 10:22.743
Shh. It's ok. It's all right.

10:27.028 --> 10:28.252
Hey. Hey. Hey.

10:30.045 --> 10:31.271
There you are. Hey.

10:32.508 --> 10:33.403
It's all right.

10:33.448 --> 10:34.552
That was weird, huh?

10:35.408 --> 10:37.592
That was weird, but everything's fine now.

10:40.288 --> 10:42.070
The diaper? No.

10:43.745 --> 10:44.640
It's all right.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.493
What's bothering you, kiddo?

10:56.866 --> 10:57.761
It's all right.

11:01.306 --> 11:02.202
Who's there?

11:06.258 --> 11:07.151
Who is it?!

11:10.616 --> 11:11.513
Who's there?!

11:29.378 --> 11:30.272
What do you want?

11:30.346 --> 11:31.243
Leave us alone!

11:31.847 --> 11:32.740
Get away!

11:33.508 --> 11:34.403
What do you want?

11:41.108 --> 11:42.001
Leave me alone!

11:42.117 --> 11:43.010
Leave me alone!

11:43.406 --> 11:44.301
Leave me alone!

12:08.175 --> 12:09.071
Georgina!

12:10.188 --> 12:11.082
Georgina?

12:19.835 --> 12:21.230
911, what's your emergency?

12:21.257 --> 12:23.903
Yes, this is an emergency. There's been an accident.

12:24.185 --> 12:25.080
Georgina!

12:36.966 --> 12:39.373
I don't want to leave her at the hospital alone.

12:39.377 --> 12:41.772
She's a little banged up, but she's stable now.

12:42.485 --> 12:44.930
Not exactly the romantic evening we had in mind.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.303
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

12:47.727 --> 12:50.312
- I'm glad you called me over here.
- The baby's ok?

12:50.317 --> 12:51.843
Yeah. She stopped crying.

12:52.778 --> 12:55.283
I gave her a crossword puzzle. It seemed to do something.

12:55.287 --> 12:57.732
Just one more woman that finds you irresistible.

12:58.347 --> 13:00.542
So, do you have any contact information on Christine?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.243
Yeah. Her number was in the kitchen.

13:02.246 --> 13:04.591
I left a message on her cell phone and her assistant's.

13:04.598 --> 13:05.492
Thank you.

13:06.265 --> 13:07.582
You know what, Jim? I gotta go.

13:07.585 --> 13:11.530
Are you sure that nothing weird has happened? No angry spirit or anything?

13:12.896 --> 13:15.400
Hey, hey. Stop worrying, ok? Everything's fine.

13:16.987 --> 13:17.883
Uh-oh.

13:18.227 --> 13:19.120
What's wrong?

13:19.508 --> 13:20.403
Nothing.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.660
She woke up. I just got slimed.

13:25.226 --> 13:27.020
You're a saint. I'll call you back.

13:27.435 --> 13:28.332
Talk to you then.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.331
Hey.

13:29.338 --> 13:30.282
Look what you did.

13:53.747 --> 13:54.641
Georgina?

13:57.495 --> 13:58.392
Georgina?

14:04.257 --> 14:05.901
There's something in that house.

14:06.075 --> 14:06.970
What?

14:07.258 --> 14:09.001
It was the boy. He did this to me.

14:09.887 --> 14:11.283
Georgina, you need to rest.

14:11.445 --> 14:12.591
He's a demon child.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.050
Watch the baby.

14:15.307 --> 14:16.340
She's in danger.

14:19.077 --> 14:19.971
I will.

14:20.995 --> 14:21.891
Ok?

14:37.836 --> 14:38.812
- Melinda?
- Yes.

14:39.118 --> 14:40.013
Oh, thank god!

14:40.226 --> 14:41.773
What happened? How's the baby?

14:42.085 --> 14:44.352
Oh, don't worry. The baby is--is fine.

14:44.895 --> 14:47.010
Georgina had an accident. She fell down the stairs.

14:47.017 --> 14:48.523
- Where's Jessie?
- She's with my husband.

14:48.527 --> 14:50.282
- Your husband?
- He's a paramedic.

14:50.285 --> 14:51.330
She's safe with him.

14:51.356 --> 14:54.300
OK, Melinda, I don't understand. How did you get involved?

14:57.286 --> 14:59.580
Well, I--I went back to your house earlier...

15:00.246 --> 15:02.151
to--to get my purse, um...

15:02.406 --> 15:04.343
because I'd left it behind, and, uh...

15:05.005 --> 15:06.602
I saw that Georgina had fallen.

15:07.826 --> 15:08.720
Is she ok?

15:09.056 --> 15:11.903
Yeah, she's gonna be fine. It was just a freak accident.

15:13.216 --> 15:16.412
This is such a nightmare. Ok, I'm getting the next flight back.

15:16.636 --> 15:20.633
I'm on my way back to your house now, and I will stay there until you get home.

15:20.726 --> 15:22.751
Melinda, are you comfortable watching a baby?

15:22.758 --> 15:26.251
Hey, I bought a car off the baby-sitting money I made in high school.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.521
I guess that means yes.

15:29.165 --> 15:30.600
We'll take good care of her, ok?

15:30.617 --> 15:32.311
Just get home as soon as you can.

15:32.338 --> 15:35.232
Ok. Thank you so much, Melinda. Thank you for everything.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.753
Looking for something?

16:17.618 --> 16:18.610
I know you're here.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.342
Where is she?

16:20.718 --> 16:22.262
What did you do with the baby?

16:36.368 --> 16:38.063
You shouldn't have fallen asleep.

17:01.635 --> 17:02.530
Jim?

17:05.076 --> 17:06.172
Hello? Where are you?

17:07.987 --> 17:08.880
Hey.

17:10.994 --> 17:12.292
Honey, I've been worried.

17:13.825 --> 17:14.720
Is everything ok?

17:14.865 --> 17:15.592
Yeah.

17:15.595 --> 17:16.612
Yeah, everything's good.

17:16.617 --> 17:18.960
I think spirit boy's messing with my head, but

17:19.105 --> 17:20.502
otherwise, things are fine.

17:20.637 --> 17:21.981
You're amazing to do this.

17:22.688 --> 17:23.680
It's like practice.

17:23.827 --> 17:25.021
Have you been sleeping?

17:25.457 --> 17:27.500
Yeah, she was up just a few minutes ago.

17:28.645 --> 17:30.341
You're wasting your time, Daniel.

17:35.835 --> 17:37.351
He was here. Now he's gone...

17:38.087 --> 17:38.981
for now.

17:41.028 --> 17:42.320
You think he's dangerous?

17:42.448 --> 17:44.103
If you can't see him, he might be.

17:44.115 --> 17:48.560
As long as I can keep an eye on him and not let Jessie out of my sight, we should be ok.

17:48.566 --> 17:51.512
Christina will be on the first flight back in the morning.

17:52.825 --> 17:53.723
So, uh,

17:53.907 --> 17:54.590
what do we do?

17:54.597 --> 17:56.251
We take turns watching the baby, right?

17:56.266 --> 17:57.311
I'll watch the baby,

17:57.365 --> 18:00.600
see if I can talk to Daniel. You get some sleep. You look exhausted.

18:00.606 --> 18:01.502
All right.

18:01.846 --> 18:02.742
Good night.

18:04.557 --> 18:05.943
Hi! Hi!

18:07.885 --> 18:09.831
Don't cry. I'll just get you a bottle.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.452
You can trust me, you know.

18:19.877 --> 18:20.772
I won't hurt you.

18:22.488 --> 18:23.380
Melinda.

18:34.808 --> 18:38.701
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider went up the water spout</i>

18:39.227 --> 18:43.192
<i>down came the rain and washed the spider out</i>

18:43.908 --> 18:47.281
<i>up came the sun and dried up all the rain</i>

18:47.546 --> 18:51.713
<i>the itsy-bitsy spider went up the spout again.</i>

18:52.337 --> 18:53.632
That's a beautiful sight.

18:54.526 --> 18:55.770
Why aren't you sleeping?

18:56.005 --> 18:57.252
I gotta go to work soon.

18:58.905 --> 18:59.721
Here. Let me try.

19:10.238 --> 19:11.282
How you doing, girl?

19:12.527 --> 19:13.423
I'm impressed.

19:15.538 --> 19:16.430
Ok.

19:16.517 --> 19:17.410
There you are.

19:17.917 --> 19:19.200
Snug as a bug in a rug.

19:19.677 --> 19:20.573
Wow.

19:20.918 --> 19:22.311
Something my mom taught me.

19:25.035 --> 19:26.480
Makes you think, doesn't it?

19:26.627 --> 19:27.472
Sure.

19:27.477 --> 19:28.373
How can it not?

19:29.865 --> 19:31.812
You'd make a great mom, you know that?

19:32.638 --> 19:33.533
Whoa.

19:33.816 --> 19:34.710
We're not ready.

19:35.115 --> 19:38.263
- It's just not time yet.
- I know. I know we said we'd wait.

19:38.466 --> 19:39.363
I do. I just...

19:41.295 --> 19:43.443
sometimes I wonder what we're waiting for.

19:43.897 --> 19:45.542
A finished house, for one thing.

19:46.897 --> 19:48.362
We have so much to do.

19:48.715 --> 19:49.892
Work, save money.

19:50.345 --> 19:51.843
I'm taking every shift I can.

19:54.546 --> 19:56.140
You're really planning on this.

19:56.938 --> 19:58.183
I'm just thinking ahead.

19:58.905 --> 19:59.802
Well, it's...

20:00.357 --> 20:01.603
just not the right time.

20:04.716 --> 20:05.612
When?

20:05.917 --> 20:07.363
You can't put a clock on it.

20:07.725 --> 20:09.720
Your heart tells you when you're ready,

20:10.455 --> 20:11.603
not your bank account.

20:12.358 --> 20:13.551
I'm just not there yet.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.471
I better go to work.

20:24.206 --> 20:25.101
I'll call you.

20:52.306 --> 20:53.450
Please don't hurt her.

20:55.328 --> 20:56.521
No, you don't hurt her.

20:57.535 --> 20:59.882
I just wanna help you. Why are you still here?

21:01.865 --> 21:02.763
I live here.

21:03.565 --> 21:04.462
This is my home.

21:05.685 --> 21:07.780
But you don't live here anymore. I mean, don't you get it?

21:07.788 --> 21:09.783
You're mother's leaving because of you.

21:09.785 --> 21:10.932
You've driven her out.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.782
She was hardly ever here anyway.

21:16.438 --> 21:18.731
The job always came first for my mom and dad.

21:22.145 --> 21:23.793
Treated me like I was invisible.

21:29.078 --> 21:30.823
She always left me with the nanny.

21:37.478 --> 21:38.672
Lots of moms work hard.

21:39.266 --> 21:40.410
You just don't get it!

21:42.497 --> 21:43.392
Stop it!

21:43.547 --> 21:46.240
- You're scaring your sister.
- Just leave me alone!

21:47.118 --> 21:48.011
Daniel?

21:52.466 --> 21:53.363
Shh. Baby.

21:54.325 --> 21:55.222
It's ok.

22:14.925 --> 22:18.122
I know that it's hard to walk away from your mother and sister,

22:18.397 --> 22:20.193
but there's a better place for you.

22:20.567 --> 22:21.462
I'm not going.

22:22.277 --> 22:25.890
You're just hurting yourself and everyone around you. Is that what you really want?

22:25.898 --> 22:27.741
I'm not leaving until they find her.

22:28.317 --> 22:29.212
Who?

22:31.906 --> 22:32.803
Suzanne.

22:33.455 --> 22:34.353
Who is she?

22:35.358 --> 22:36.251
My nanny before.

22:38.456 --> 22:39.603
Is she special to you?

22:41.107 --> 22:42.003
Special.

22:52.856 --> 22:53.981
She watched me die.

23:10.437 --> 23:11.333
Melinda!

23:12.618 --> 23:14.133
- Melinda!
- I'm up here.

23:16.655 --> 23:19.472
- Oh, my god. I was so worried.
- That's ok. She's fine.

23:19.476 --> 23:21.870
She slept almost all the way through the night.

23:24.145 --> 23:25.043
How's Georgina?

23:25.346 --> 23:26.240
Ok.

23:26.797 --> 23:29.440
Nothing's broken. It's a miracle. Just some bruises.

23:30.856 --> 23:32.351
I guess that'll be a lawsuit.

23:34.935 --> 23:35.833
I'm sorry.

23:36.038 --> 23:37.932
You must think I'm hard or something.

23:38.136 --> 23:40.233
No. I know that you have a lot of stress.

23:40.516 --> 23:42.863
It's just that work is really important to me.

23:43.276 --> 23:47.520
I want her to have everything that she needs, especially now that her father's gone.

23:47.716 --> 23:49.513
It's what I wanted for my son, too.

23:50.436 --> 23:53.182
Georgina told me that you lost your son. I'm so sorry.

23:54.775 --> 23:56.373
My husband and I, we were so...

23:57.617 --> 23:58.510
devastated.

23:59.157 --> 24:03.100
Just lost, you know. We couldn't figure out a plan. We didn't know what to do.

24:04.428 --> 24:07.820
I thought if we had another child it would give us a second chance.

24:08.136 --> 24:09.031
And it didn't.

24:10.735 --> 24:12.582
Ted just couldn't get back on track.

24:14.375 --> 24:15.270
I'm so sorry.

24:16.486 --> 24:19.463
Look, is there anything I can-- can I pay you for your time or...?

24:19.467 --> 24:22.111
No. No, I'm just really glad that it all worked out.

24:22.757 --> 24:24.453
There must be something I can do.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.492
Maybe one thing.

24:26.058 --> 24:28.303
You had a nanny before. Suzanne. Do you know

24:28.665 --> 24:29.812
how I might reach her?

24:30.948 --> 24:32.342
Who told you about Suzanne?

24:33.758 --> 24:35.541
Georgina... mentioned her.

24:36.405 --> 24:38.900
'Cause I have a friend who's looking for a nanny.

24:39.978 --> 24:43.270
Well, tell your friend to keep looking. She doesn't want Suzanne.

24:49.915 --> 24:52.543
You think Suzanne might be responsible for Daniel's death?

24:52.546 --> 24:54.541
I don't know, but either way, I have to find out.

24:54.547 --> 24:56.411
Because Daniel may be looking for revenge.

24:56.417 --> 24:59.211
- Man, he sounds like a little terror.
- Yeah, he's very troubled.

24:59.217 --> 25:01.800
I wish you'd called me last night. I would have been glad to come and help.

25:01.805 --> 25:03.831
Jim was there. Otherwise, I definitely would have.

25:03.835 --> 25:07.080
Ah! I get it. You were living out your dirty babysitter fantasy.

25:07.297 --> 25:10.693
Hardly. He saw me with the baby and started talking about having one of our own.

25:10.697 --> 25:13.652
- Oh! That's exciting.
- No, not really.

25:13.976 --> 25:17.573
Oh, come on, Melinda. Every time you see a baby, you're practically drooling.

25:17.576 --> 25:20.271
That does not mean I want to start a family tomorrow.

25:20.445 --> 25:21.213
Fine.

25:21.218 --> 25:23.373
Procreate at your own pace. See if I care.

25:23.747 --> 25:27.220
I'm sorry. I just hope that he doesn't start putting pressure on me about this.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.832
You know what? I totally get it. It's a huge responsibility.

25:29.835 --> 25:31.552
You shouldn't rush into it. He'll understand.

25:31.557 --> 25:33.551
- Oh! I found something!
- What is it?

25:33.886 --> 25:35.783
A newspaper report on Daniel's death.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.412
Does it say how he died?

25:37.436 --> 25:39.330
No. The police say it was accidental.

25:40.138 --> 25:42.311
But it does give me Suzanne's last name.

25:53.337 --> 25:54.231
Mr. Richards?

25:55.216 --> 25:55.980
Yeah?

25:55.985 --> 25:56.882
Is Suzanne here?

25:57.305 --> 25:58.200
Who's asking?

25:58.538 --> 26:01.583
Sorry. I'm Melinda Gordon. I'm a friend of Christine Greene.

26:02.416 --> 26:03.312
Oh, no.

26:03.916 --> 26:06.082
Please don't bring this whole thing up again.

26:06.087 --> 26:10.283
Do you have any idea how my wife's life was destroyed by what happened to that boy?

26:10.927 --> 26:12.272
I may be able to help her.

26:13.626 --> 26:14.521
How?

26:15.207 --> 26:17.450
Can you just tell me where I could find her?

26:31.316 --> 26:32.211
You've seen me.

26:32.827 --> 26:33.770
You gotta help me.

26:34.106 --> 26:36.540
Come on, lady. The jig is up. You looked me right in the eye.

26:36.547 --> 26:38.462
- Not now, ok?
- Yes. Please.

26:38.716 --> 26:41.691
I need to get a message to my wife. She's been living here for years.

26:41.695 --> 26:44.380
Do you have any idea how long I've been hanging around this place?

26:44.387 --> 26:45.280
It's depressing.

26:45.497 --> 26:48.131
The sheer monotony, not to mention the smell.

26:48.457 --> 26:50.701
Bleach and ammonia. I can't take it anymore.

26:55.505 --> 26:56.441
Oh, right.

26:56.688 --> 26:58.130
The kid gets your attention.

26:59.567 --> 27:00.940
- What am I, wood?
- You know what?

27:00.947 --> 27:03.193
I need you to help me find Suzanne Richards.

27:03.306 --> 27:04.403
Now you need my help?

27:04.495 --> 27:06.132
She's a caretaker, in her twenties.

27:06.138 --> 27:07.563
Are you gonna help me talk to my wife or not?

27:07.565 --> 27:10.761
If you help me find Suzanne, I will owe you one, ok? I promise.

27:11.365 --> 27:13.132
- I can't believe this.
- Please?

27:14.137 --> 27:15.833
She works up on the second floor.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.972
She was just up there changing the beds.

27:22.387 --> 27:23.281
Yes!

27:33.736 --> 27:34.630
Hi.

27:34.947 --> 27:36.640
- Who are you?
- Melinda Gordon.

27:37.338 --> 27:39.631
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I think so.

27:40.568 --> 27:42.213
I just don't know what happened.

27:43.138 --> 27:44.693
I'm--I'm sorry. Who are you?

27:45.255 --> 27:46.521
You're Suzanne, right?

27:47.357 --> 27:49.100
I'm a friend of the Greene family.

27:49.885 --> 27:50.780
Oh.

27:51.187 --> 27:53.182
And I want to talk to you about Daniel.

27:54.026 --> 27:57.220
I'm sorry. I don't know what you want, but I don't talk about Daniel.

27:57.238 --> 27:58.533
Well, he talks about you.

27:59.327 --> 28:01.242
- Daniel's dead.
- Daniel's here.

28:01.757 --> 28:02.851
Who the hell are you?

28:03.996 --> 28:05.990
Just a person who's trying to help you.

28:06.885 --> 28:10.031
Look, I know that this is hard to believe, but Daniel's here--

28:10.068 --> 28:14.011
his spirit anyway-- and he told me that he won't cross over until he sees you.

28:16.637 --> 28:18.681
- I'm calling security.
- Please don't.

28:19.897 --> 28:22.523
Just give me 5 minutes. You may be in danger.

28:23.107 --> 28:25.051
She's wearing the bracelet I made her.

28:26.685 --> 28:28.132
This is the one she made me.

28:33.418 --> 28:36.111
He says that you're wearing the bracelet he made you,

28:36.586 --> 28:38.782
and he's wearing the one that you made him.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.342
I don't understand.

28:44.486 --> 28:46.933
Ask her if she remembers what happened that day.

28:47.716 --> 28:50.912
He wants to know if you remember what happened the day he died.

28:52.188 --> 28:54.482
Do I remember? What kind of question is that?

28:54.915 --> 28:56.010
I'll always remember.

28:56.515 --> 28:57.763
He wants you to tell me.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.102
I only know what happened after.

29:06.565 --> 29:07.462
After what?

29:08.765 --> 29:10.982
After he went upstairs to see Christine.

29:12.966 --> 29:14.411
It was saturday, my day off,

29:15.526 --> 29:18.721
but Christine had asked me to do some household chores for her.

29:19.298 --> 29:20.793
I heard Daniel. He was upset.

29:21.325 --> 29:22.923
He was running down the stairs.

29:24.938 --> 29:25.833
Daniel?

29:33.836 --> 29:34.730
Daniel!

29:38.677 --> 29:40.542
Daniel! Stop! What are you doing?!

29:45.937 --> 29:46.833
Daniel!

29:49.778 --> 29:51.872
By the time I got there, it was too late.

29:56.577 --> 29:57.471
I saw him die.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.213
He died right in front of me, looking at me.

30:03.247 --> 30:04.742
He said his last words to me.

30:08.055 --> 30:09.003
And then Christine

30:09.577 --> 30:10.923
was right there behind me.

30:33.807 --> 30:35.291
Somebody please help us!

30:38.896 --> 30:40.843
It was all over in less than a minute.

30:44.438 --> 30:47.363
But I can't get the image of that car out of my head,

30:50.066 --> 30:52.811
of his face, of Christine's face.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.003
Sometimes I wake up thinking

30:59.845 --> 31:02.993
I should have stopped him somehow. There must have been a way.

31:03.855 --> 31:05.672
Maybe if I would have been quicker.

31:09.558 --> 31:11.142
My mother thought that Suzanne

31:12.227 --> 31:14.122
could have done something to stop me,

31:15.195 --> 31:16.090
but she's wrong.

31:20.696 --> 31:22.342
She couldn't have done anything.

31:27.396 --> 31:29.241
I never meant for her to get blamed.

31:31.516 --> 31:33.711
She's the only person that took care of me,

31:34.246 --> 31:35.293
the only person that

31:35.836 --> 31:37.101
really cared, you know.

31:40.706 --> 31:41.653
She made me laugh.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.921
Sit with me for hours and play with the trains.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.040
What?

31:49.047 --> 31:51.190
- What's happening in here?
- One second.

31:51.405 --> 31:55.150
She helped me pick out all the jobs and names for the people in that town.

31:56.886 --> 31:59.920
They all had crazy relationships in that town, Bakersville.

32:01.145 --> 32:02.740
He's talking about Bakersville.

32:07.345 --> 32:08.361
He's really here.

32:17.587 --> 32:20.382
Bakersville, that was a real "payton place," that town.

32:23.886 --> 32:25.833
Tell her she couldn't have stopped me.

32:26.538 --> 32:27.483
It wasn't her job.

32:29.476 --> 32:30.373
Not that day.

32:31.956 --> 32:35.453
He wants you to know that everything that happened wasn't your fault.

32:36.065 --> 32:37.563
There's nothing you could do.

32:40.795 --> 32:42.210
Daniel, I miss you so much.

32:47.388 --> 32:48.680
Tell her I miss her, too.

32:49.977 --> 32:50.971
He misses you, too.

32:52.466 --> 32:53.362
He's crying.

32:54.348 --> 32:55.311
I'm not crying!

32:56.945 --> 32:59.093
Why is she here with all these old people?

32:59.865 --> 33:02.660
He wants to know why you're not working with kids anymore.

33:02.668 --> 33:06.060
I haven't really been able to be around kids. It's better this way.

33:09.888 --> 33:10.831
What does he want?

33:15.018 --> 33:16.663
I want her to go talk to my mom.

33:18.405 --> 33:20.501
He wants you to go and talk to Christine.

33:21.956 --> 33:22.850
No.

33:23.778 --> 33:24.670
I can't. I...

33:26.745 --> 33:28.042
no. I couldn't face her.

33:32.288 --> 33:35.382
I need her to tell my mother what I said right before I died.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.923
I didn't know if-- if you'd see me.

33:53.508 --> 33:56.150
- Melinda said there was a good reason.
- There is.

33:56.846 --> 33:59.292
I just need you to have an open mind and listen.

34:00.257 --> 34:02.751
Suzanne has something that she needs to tell you.

34:06.548 --> 34:07.441
Christine...

34:09.746 --> 34:10.963
the day Daniel died,

34:11.708 --> 34:12.600
when I heard

34:13.337 --> 34:15.121
the crash, I ran to the car.

34:16.108 --> 34:18.081
I got there. Daniel was conscious.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.263
He looked up at me,

34:20.545 --> 34:23.440
and he told me something that I was never gonna tell you.

34:25.585 --> 34:26.483
He said...

34:27.186 --> 34:28.531
I wish you were my mother.

34:33.985 --> 34:35.420
He said that to you?

34:42.295 --> 34:44.991
That's a terrible thing to tell me even if it's true.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.391
I know. I'm sorry.

34:46.547 --> 34:48.772
This is something that I was never gonna tell you.

34:48.775 --> 34:51.922
- Well, then why now?
- Because Daniel wanted you to hear it.

34:52.478 --> 34:53.871
What are you talking about?

34:53.916 --> 34:57.192
Christine, the weird things that happen in this house, the sounds,

34:57.195 --> 34:59.442
the accident with Georgina, it's all Daniel.

35:00.157 --> 35:01.061
He's still here.

35:01.957 --> 35:03.801
Are you completely out of your mind?

35:04.345 --> 35:05.240
It's true.

35:05.805 --> 35:07.831
I didn't believe it either, but it's true.

35:07.835 --> 35:11.732
Moving out of this house is not gonna solve anything. Daniel will follow you.

35:12.835 --> 35:15.810
So you're telling me that my son...

35:17.105 --> 35:18.000
is haunting me?

35:18.506 --> 35:19.403
Yes...

35:19.976 --> 35:21.221
and he's here right now.

35:22.635 --> 35:24.130
Oh, my god. This is too much.

35:25.848 --> 35:26.741
This is too much.

35:29.337 --> 35:31.230
Ask her if she remembers the promise.

35:31.357 --> 35:34.100
He wants to know if you remember the promise you made.

35:37.028 --> 35:39.421
Well, if he's really here, ask him to tell you.

35:44.955 --> 35:49.053
Well, it was the day after she got back from a 2-week business trip.

35:49.966 --> 35:51.110
Danny, I have to work.

35:52.256 --> 35:53.153
All the time?

35:53.197 --> 35:55.640
It's not all the time. I know it seems that way.

35:55.898 --> 35:57.530
Yes, it is all the time.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.102
Even when you're home,

36:00.725 --> 36:03.053
you're on the phone, the computer, doing something.

36:03.056 --> 36:04.401
We live a good life.

36:05.475 --> 36:07.203
What do you think pays for that?

36:08.265 --> 36:10.741
That doesn't come for free, sweetie. You know that.

36:10.745 --> 36:11.642
Yes...

36:12.068 --> 36:13.713
but what good is this good life?

36:14.578 --> 36:15.503
What good is it?

36:16.136 --> 36:17.163
I never see you.

36:18.175 --> 36:19.073
Ok.

36:19.276 --> 36:21.871
How about on saturday, we got to the baseball game?

36:22.258 --> 36:24.151
Just you and me. And then after that,

36:24.886 --> 36:28.233
we'll go to Geneo's and we'll get some pizza. How does that sound?

36:29.025 --> 36:29.921
I guess.

36:30.488 --> 36:31.763
Ok. It's a date,

36:32.746 --> 36:33.642
all right?

36:33.827 --> 36:34.723
Ok.

36:35.407 --> 36:37.403
She broke that promise like all others.

36:38.506 --> 36:41.122
Yes, it is the same clothing. I'm looking at it right now.

36:41.128 --> 36:42.021
I am going.

36:42.028 --> 36:44.273
No, you cannot sell the same clothing line on the web site

36:44.275 --> 36:47.280
that they're selling at Bloomingdale's. That's a breach of my contract with them.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.201
Honey, this is a really important phone call.

36:49.217 --> 36:51.062
Mom, we're missing the first inning.

36:51.155 --> 36:52.653
5 minutes. Give me 5 minutes.

36:52.818 --> 36:53.710
What? No.

36:54.398 --> 36:57.192
You're gonna have to take if off the web site. That's the only solution.

36:57.198 --> 36:58.092
I'll go.

36:59.796 --> 37:00.693
Mom.

37:02.438 --> 37:03.353
I'm going!

37:04.328 --> 37:05.591
I'm going by myself!

37:28.707 --> 37:29.852
He's telling you this?

37:30.726 --> 37:31.621
Right now?

37:34.037 --> 37:34.932
Why?

37:35.156 --> 37:37.651
Because he wants you to know why he was so angry,

37:38.447 --> 37:39.682
why he is so angry.

37:41.007 --> 37:41.900
Daniel,

37:42.768 --> 37:44.432
I did it all for you.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.350
I grew up with nothing.

37:47.577 --> 37:49.522
I wasn't gonna let that happen to you.

37:49.876 --> 37:51.321
I grew up with nothing, too.

37:53.098 --> 37:54.442
I just had a lot of stuff.

37:57.585 --> 37:58.603
I just wanted her.

38:00.518 --> 38:01.411
He said that

38:02.065 --> 38:04.061
everything you gave him never mattered.

38:05.606 --> 38:08.651
He just wanted to spend time with you. That's all he needed.

38:09.857 --> 38:11.102
He loved you, Christine.

38:11.816 --> 38:16.313
He was always talking about you. He was always thinking about what would make you happy,

38:16.348 --> 38:18.042
what would make you proud of him.

38:18.646 --> 38:19.842
I was proud if him.

38:21.335 --> 38:23.533
I just wished she would have shown it to me

38:23.905 --> 38:24.801
sometimes.

38:25.328 --> 38:28.271
He just wishes that you would have shown him how you felt.

38:28.736 --> 38:29.752
I thought he knew.

38:33.148 --> 38:35.441
Tell her she has to be different with Jessie.

38:35.875 --> 38:37.473
She can't have it happen again.

38:38.358 --> 38:39.802
He wants you to be different

38:40.508 --> 38:42.252
with Jessie. She really needs you.

38:47.476 --> 38:48.371
Ok.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.922
Tell her that that's why I scared the other nannies away.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.912
That's why he gave the other nannies such a hard time.

39:01.996 --> 39:03.023
Tell him I'm sorry.

39:05.646 --> 39:06.542
He knows.

39:17.857 --> 39:19.453
Tell her I'm gonna be ok now...

39:21.877 --> 39:23.320
that I want her to be happy.

39:35.595 --> 39:38.422
- Am I supposed to be over there?
- The light?

39:39.676 --> 39:40.572
Yeah.

39:42.935 --> 39:46.030
Tell Suzanne she shouldn't be afraid to work with kids again.

39:47.265 --> 39:48.410
Someone does need her.

39:53.598 --> 39:54.493
I love you.

40:01.595 --> 40:02.493
Thanks.

40:06.305 --> 40:07.200
Good-bye.

40:16.475 --> 40:17.543
- I'll go--
- No.

40:17.968 --> 40:18.890
I got it.

40:31.215 --> 40:32.182
Hi! I'm home!

40:32.697 --> 40:33.593
Where are you?

40:35.816 --> 40:37.170
Whoa! Hey!

40:37.635 --> 40:38.953
Hi. Are you home for the night?

40:38.957 --> 40:42.453
Bobby is back at work tomorrow. So I do not have to be in until noon.

40:42.838 --> 40:44.581
Hallelujah. I get my husband back.

40:44.658 --> 40:45.373
No, no!

40:45.375 --> 40:46.041
No!

40:46.045 --> 40:48.703
I'm cooking for you tonight, and you are not helping me in any way.

40:48.705 --> 40:50.342
I'm backing away from grocery bags.

40:50.347 --> 40:52.542
This is supposed to be a surprise, so shoo!

40:54.966 --> 40:56.410
- I said shoo.
- All right.

40:56.586 --> 40:57.631
Just getting a beer.

40:59.625 --> 41:00.521
Stop it.

41:02.556 --> 41:04.701
You know, we never finished our conversation.

41:04.705 --> 41:05.652
What conversation?

41:06.308 --> 41:07.901
- The baby conversation.
- Oh.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.911
I thought we finished that conversation, at least for now.

41:13.935 --> 41:14.882
What's wrong, Mel?

41:15.377 --> 41:16.272
Nothing's wrong.

41:16.555 --> 41:18.953
We always talk about having babies. It always makes you laugh.

41:18.965 --> 41:21.013
I know you wanna wait. That's ok. But...

41:21.526 --> 41:22.723
there's something else.

41:23.406 --> 41:24.303
Seems like you're

41:24.686 --> 41:25.582
scared by it.

41:26.718 --> 41:27.612
Maybe I am.

41:28.797 --> 41:29.693
Why?

41:30.188 --> 41:31.331
Well, because I always

41:31.668 --> 41:33.611
thought the gift skipped a generation.

41:34.328 --> 41:35.371
Now I'm not so sure.

41:38.945 --> 41:41.091
You're afraid our baby might be able to...

41:43.497 --> 41:44.390
No...

41:45.868 --> 41:47.662
yes--I don't know. It's just, um...

41:50.065 --> 41:51.410
it's hard to be different.

41:53.085 --> 41:54.983
You know, it's a struggle, especially

41:55.256 --> 41:56.200
when you're a kid.

41:56.537 --> 41:58.700
The ridicule, humiliation, loneliness.

42:01.128 --> 42:02.023
Are you lonely?

42:02.285 --> 42:03.183
Not anymore, but

42:04.185 --> 42:07.843
look at what it did to the relationship between me and my mother. I mean,

42:07.846 --> 42:08.742
she can hardly

42:09.408 --> 42:11.751
speak to me. Sometimes barely even look at me.

42:13.525 --> 42:15.373
What if I'm like that with our kids?

42:20.885 --> 42:22.233
That's never gonna happen.

42:23.808 --> 42:24.703
I know you.

42:26.186 --> 42:27.081
And our kids,

42:28.005 --> 42:29.353
they'll know who they are,

42:29.688 --> 42:30.980
and they'll know it's ok.

42:31.198 --> 42:32.692
Whatever they do or can't do,

42:33.856 --> 42:34.750
they'll be loved.

42:36.366 --> 42:37.311
How will you feel?

42:38.306 --> 42:41.763
Me? I'll be happy to have a whole brood of baby ghostbusters.

42:41.937 --> 42:43.083
Now I know you're a liar.

42:43.088 --> 42:46.131
No. If they all turn out like you, I don't see the downside.

42:47.007 --> 42:47.902
Bring it on.

42:52.007 --> 42:56.001
