WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.754
Picking up a custom order.
Andreas von Strucker.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.523
SHOPKEEPER:
I was able to do the

00:22.556 --> 00:24.858
modification you requested.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.197
REED: Concerned that
she just seems different.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.365
She's obsessed
with that music box.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.734
Look, if we're really gonna
bring down the Inner Circle,

00:33.767 --> 00:35.436
she needs to be ready.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.272
LAUREN:
What is this place?

00:38.306 --> 00:41.242
We can do things
that you can't imagine.

00:41.275 --> 00:44.778
LAUREN: It was weird.
It didn't feel like a dream.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.547
-You think you saw Andy?
-Yes.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.549
John, it's Evangeline.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.918
Gather your people. Be ready.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.520
ERG: I made a commitment
to this place.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.022
My first priority
is to protect the Morlocks,

00:55.055 --> 00:58.126
as I would protect you
if you chose to join us.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.094
POLARIS: I'm here 'cause
I need your help, please.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.629
Your race war isn't turning out
like you'd hoped?

01:01.662 --> 01:02.663
POLARIS:
Marcos, she has the team

01:02.696 --> 01:04.598
from the Ignavus cruise
ship massacre.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.201
I need to stop her.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.404
ECLIPSE: What is Reeva doing
with Benedict Ryan?

01:12.840 --> 01:14.542
(insects chirping,
frogs croaking)

01:14.575 --> 01:16.910
YOUNG BLINK: Seriously,
you wouldn't kiss the vampire?

01:16.944 --> 01:19.380
He sparkles and he's, like,
incredibly handsome.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.782
Yeah. So what? His breath
would smell like blood.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.151
(laughing):
That's so gross.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.985
So, then make him use mouthwash.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.654
-Just...
-(both laughing)

01:26.687 --> 01:28.322
(vehicle approaching)

01:28.356 --> 01:30.791
(thud)

01:31.825 --> 01:33.794
(car door opens and closes)

01:34.695 --> 01:37.965
Whose junk is this?!

01:37.998 --> 01:39.633
At least
he's in a good mood today.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.834
(door slams)

01:40.868 --> 01:42.336
Mutie kids leaving crap out.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.571
Serves you right, Miles!

01:43.604 --> 01:44.972
Don't even start with me, woman.

01:45.005 --> 01:48.008
He sounds pretty drunk.
Maybe he'll fall asleep

01:48.041 --> 01:49.843
-on the couch again.
-MILES: All y'all brats,

01:49.877 --> 01:52.346
get out here! Now!
You hear me?

01:52.380 --> 01:53.647
FOSTER MOM:
Will you keep it down

01:53.681 --> 01:55.183
and get in the house? It's late.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.950
-He doesn't sound sleepy.
-(clattering outside)

01:56.984 --> 01:58.519
MILES:
Get your lazy asses up.

01:58.552 --> 02:02.089
Lilly, you know
he's not gonna leave us alone.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.624
MILES: Pete, Freddy,
get out here this minute.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.159
-I've been practicing the thing.
-FOSTER MOM: They're sleeping.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.960
-We could use it.
-MILES: You think I give a damn?

02:06.994 --> 02:08.662
I can't get us far,
but I can get us away.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.030
-No, we can't.
-We can.

02:10.063 --> 02:12.766
-Any place is better than this.
-(door slamming)

02:12.800 --> 02:14.802
MILES:
Don't you give me no lip, woman.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.004
-Lilly, Clarice.
-Oh, God, he's coming.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.872
Don't make me come find you.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.779
(whooshing)

02:25.813 --> 02:27.781
What is it?
Like a tunnel?

02:27.815 --> 02:30.117
It's like a door. It's okay.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.019
-Open up!
-(knocking)

02:32.052 --> 02:34.222
-Lilly, we have to go.
-No, we can't.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.490
What about the others?
He'll just take it out at them.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.058
-Lilly, come on.
-(loud knocking)

02:38.091 --> 02:39.860
MILES: This is my house!
You open this door!

02:39.893 --> 02:41.829
Lilly, please, I can't face him.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.863
(Blink gasps)

02:42.896 --> 02:44.998
-Open up.
-(knocking)

02:45.032 --> 02:47.134
You open the damn door now!

02:47.167 --> 02:48.869
(knocking)

02:59.847 --> 03:01.949
(rain falling)

03:05.052 --> 03:07.054
(groans)

03:08.956 --> 03:11.191
You know, the thing
about bed rest is,

03:11.225 --> 03:13.861
you actually have to be in bed
for it to work.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.865
I'm fine. Strong as ever.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.867
Yeah, well, strong people need
to sleep, too,

03:19.900 --> 03:22.736
even if they haven't been shot.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.405
Well, Evangeline is coming
tomorrow.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.206
There's a lot of work to do.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.875
I get it.

03:27.908 --> 03:31.445
You're nervous.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.913
But you know what?

03:32.946 --> 03:35.549
Evangeline is the leader
of the network, so I feel like,

03:35.583 --> 03:37.351
you know, she's gonna have
a pretty good idea...

03:37.385 --> 03:39.287
I just think that if...

03:41.154 --> 03:42.923
(laughs)

03:42.956 --> 03:44.358
I feel like the glorious crusade

03:44.392 --> 03:46.927
of the X-Men can wait
a couple hours.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.434
Just come to bed.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.807
ECLIPSE: Lorna, you cannot
go back to the Inner Circle.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.309
POLARIS:
I have to.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.076
What are you talking about?
We just saw your boss...

04:03.110 --> 04:05.746
-Whoa, she's not my boss.
-Okay, well, whatever Reeva is.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.214
The grand supreme leader

04:07.247 --> 04:09.317
was just meeting America's
number one mutant-hater!

04:09.350 --> 04:10.818
Look, I don't know
what's going on, but I know

04:10.851 --> 04:12.786
-it's too dangerous.
-Too dangerous for who, Marcos?

04:12.820 --> 04:15.723
Huh? Look, Reeva's planning
a terror attack.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.492
If I walk away now,
who's gonna stop it?

04:18.526 --> 04:20.160
Evangeline.

04:20.193 --> 04:22.396
She's gathering
what's left of the Underground.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.164
-I'm sure she'll have you back.
-Yeah.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.401
Right after she dragon-fires
my face for leaving.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.738
If I can see past it,
so can she.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.273
She knows
what you mean to this fight.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.643
I mean, even with Evangeline,
it's still not enough.

04:35.676 --> 04:39.179
Reeva can take out an entire
room of people in two seconds.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.516
We have to figure out
what she's planning.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.752
I helped start this.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.020
I have to end it.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.290
All right.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.794
Be careful.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.269
EVANGELINE:
If what you say is true,

05:02.302 --> 05:06.273
if Polaris really is on our side
again, there may be some hope.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.376
She is all we have.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.143
We need to protect her.

05:10.177 --> 05:14.147
No one can say or do anything
that might expose her.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.016
What if we told Andy
what she's doing?

05:16.049 --> 05:18.986
You'd put him in danger,
along with all of you.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.154
The only reason you're still
breathing is because

05:21.188 --> 05:22.856
Reeva thinks Andy
and Polaris are loyal

05:22.890 --> 05:25.359
and wants to keep them that way.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.861
How do we stop them?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.196
We'll meet
with the Underground leaders

05:29.229 --> 05:30.698
from the rest of the country
tomorrow

05:30.731 --> 05:33.000
to see who they can send.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.536
Most of the Underground stations
around here have gone dark.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.337
THUNDERBIRD: And the ones still
standing don't have many mutants

05:37.371 --> 05:40.007
-with fighting abilities.
-EVANGELINE: It doesn't matter.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.676
We need anyone. And not just
from the Underground.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.044
You'll need to bring
the Morlocks to this meeting.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.746
(scoffs)
Yeah, right.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.515
I mean, Erg made it pretty clear
that he's not

05:47.548 --> 05:49.216
gonna fight our war.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.852
Erg and I have a history.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.755
I saved his life
a long time ago in Dallas.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.225
He'll come.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.134
Okay.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.238
(elevator bell dings)

06:13.373 --> 06:15.809
(whooshing)

06:20.881 --> 06:23.717
(explosive pop,
debris clinking)

06:23.751 --> 06:25.252
Bravo.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.087
Ah, look who's here.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.356
-You come down to watch?
-(laughs)

06:29.389 --> 06:31.859
You're not the only ones
around here who train.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.061
(whooshing)

06:35.629 --> 06:37.230
Wow.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.935
I thought you three were doing
some big secret attack.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.037
Special assignment from Reeva.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.906
You're not supposed
to talk about it.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.542
-Yeah, it's, uh, top secret.
-Well,

06:48.576 --> 06:51.044
guess who has green hair
and is good at keeping secrets.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.914
-Interesting.
-HEATHER: Max.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.986
We'll talk about it later.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.389
Nice.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.459
(sighs)

07:05.493 --> 07:07.194
(grunts)

07:09.029 --> 07:10.330
(groans)

07:10.363 --> 07:11.632
(sighs)

07:11.665 --> 07:14.835
25. A new record.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.770
Was it? (exhales)

07:16.804 --> 07:19.507
I wasn't counting.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.575
(typing)

07:21.609 --> 07:23.511
How's it going?

07:23.544 --> 07:25.278
All I can say is, I hope

07:25.312 --> 07:27.014
Evangeline can convince
the Underground

07:27.047 --> 07:29.016
in the rest of the country
to help.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.284
I've been thinking
about what Marcos saw.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.753
About Benedict Ryan.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.322
Well, Lorna's getting
what she can.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.690
And it's not enough.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.259
Reeva's keeping this
from her own people.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.328
If we're gonna figure out
what's going on,

07:41.361 --> 07:42.996
we have to do more.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.965
Which would be what, exactly?

07:45.866 --> 07:47.768
What about my brother?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.269
-What?
-Benedict Ryan

07:49.302 --> 07:51.872
is openly supporting
the Purifiers now.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.307
Danny's firm works
with Homeland Security.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.777
They-they keep tabs
on all the extremist groups,

07:56.810 --> 07:58.178
Purifiers included.
If they could tell us...

07:58.211 --> 08:00.147
You can't just get
on the phone to Danny.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.783
Need I remind you that half
of his family are fugitives.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.652
Yeah, fugitives
the world thinks are dead.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.053
The government will be

08:06.086 --> 08:08.188
monitoring his calls
for the rest of his life.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.891
Then we go in person,
first thing tomorrow.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.561
-And what about the summit?
-You can handle the summit,
right?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.028
Reed, this can't wait.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.397
We need to know
what our son is involved in.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.568
So, you're gonna get in the car
alone and drive to Atlanta?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.069
LAUREN:
She's not going alone.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.004
(sighs)
I'm coming, too.

08:24.037 --> 08:27.074
Mom is right. Uncle Danny
helped us when you were in jail.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.242
And you nearly got killed
by Purifiers.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.345
Which is more of a reason
for him to help us now.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.548
REED: Or more of a reason
to steer clear.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.184
Your brother has a habit
of looking out for number one.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.921
Danny and I have had our issues,
but I know him.

08:40.954 --> 08:44.057
He won't be able to look us
in the eye and say no.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.198
Okay.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.073
(whooshes, clicks)

09:05.713 --> 09:07.380
(sighs)
Okay.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.854
Two sides.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.288
(murmurs)

09:19.259 --> 09:22.763
Das erhoffte.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.798
Durch... dich.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.300
Durch dich.

09:27.334 --> 09:31.038
Lebt unser
Vermächtnis weiter.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.740
ANDREAS:
If you've found this,

09:32.773 --> 09:35.609
the miracle we had hoped for
may still be within reach.

09:35.643 --> 09:40.247
My sister and I wanted to free
our people from bondage.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.916
You must succeed
where we have failed.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.722
Fenris has two sides.

09:48.756 --> 09:51.324
The light and the darkness.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.326
Always in conflict.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.130
As my sister and I battled,
so you must battle.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.100
Only when you know
each other's strength

10:00.133 --> 10:04.204
and embrace your opposing
forces will you be whole.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.743
What are you doing here?

10:09.777 --> 10:12.980
I'm here to tell you that
you're going down a dark path.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.784
You need to stop now...
before it's too late.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.451
You don't know anything
about what I need.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.420
I know a lot more
than you think...

10:20.453 --> 10:23.691
about us, about Fenris.

10:23.724 --> 10:28.328
So what?
You're gonna try to stop me?

10:28.361 --> 10:29.763
I warned you, Lauren.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.665
No, I'm warning you.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.333
I'm stronger now.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.735
So, bring it on.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.119
(screams, gasps)

10:52.152 --> 10:54.387
(sighs)

10:56.556 --> 10:59.960
Oh. What?

10:59.993 --> 11:03.330
Andy, what happened?

11:03.363 --> 11:04.732
It was Lauren.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.139
Lauren and I have these...

11:12.172 --> 11:13.506
(sniffs)

11:13.540 --> 11:15.475
...dreams...

11:15.508 --> 11:17.477
together.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.879
We're both there.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.247
We can talk.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.716
Hmm. A lot more than talk,
apparently.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.718
How long has this been going on?

11:24.752 --> 11:27.087
-Like a few months.
-Months?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.688
And you didn't mention anything?

11:28.722 --> 11:30.323
Well, it wasn't
like this before.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.491
(exhales)

11:31.524 --> 11:34.027
Lauren's stronger.
She said something about...

11:34.061 --> 11:36.696
our family or our powers...

11:36.730 --> 11:38.832
Okay, uh, Andy,

11:38.866 --> 11:41.101
if you're getting attacked
in your dreams,

11:41.134 --> 11:44.037
and in our training room,
no less,

11:44.071 --> 11:46.506
it's not safe
to have Lauren out there.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.175
I think it might be time

11:48.208 --> 11:51.544
for you to reach out to her.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.781
You mean... bring her here?

11:54.714 --> 11:55.749
I tried.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.751
Well, we can help you with that.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.452
I-If you let us.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.989
ANDY:
What do you mean?

12:03.290 --> 12:06.193
Your mind is connected
to Lauren's.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.262
We can reach her, through you.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.600
I don't know.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.803
What if Lauren found out?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.971
Listen, we know a thing or three

12:18.005 --> 12:20.407
about psychic connections
between siblings.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.542
Just, um...

12:22.575 --> 12:24.812
think about it.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.847
Get some rest.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.484
-(door closes)
-(sighs)

12:31.518 --> 12:33.153
SOPHIE:
"Think about it"?

12:33.186 --> 12:36.223
What are you, a camp counselor?
The sister's getting bolder.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.991
We can't afford
to have her out there.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.927
(sighs)
I'm aware of that.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.096
But this is delicate.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.998
Do you want to tell Reeva
that we pushed Andy away?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.333
Because I sure as hell don't.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.668
And it's not just that.
Think about the power

12:48.701 --> 12:50.938
we could have
if we bring Lauren over.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.006
Especially if she's
getting stronger.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.808
She has to join us.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.110
Or she has to die.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.985
(sighs)

13:05.018 --> 13:07.587
Oh, I'm gonna go out on a limb

13:07.620 --> 13:10.157
and say that this is not a place
where good stuff happens.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.826
Evangeline said that Erg's just
gonna come and meet us here?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.627
THUNDERBIRD: It saves us
a trip to the sewers.

13:14.661 --> 13:17.330
Erg's whole thing is, he doesn't
come out of the tunnels.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.799
Now all of a sudden he's like,
bring on the sunshine?

13:19.833 --> 13:22.435
Evangeline saved his life.
He owes her.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.703
Owes her what?

13:23.736 --> 13:25.672
Exposing his people
to a war he hates?

13:25.705 --> 13:27.007
Well, we are
saving mutants, right?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.676
Isn't it possible she just
talked some sense into them?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.278
Possible? Sure.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.546
-But not likely.
-Okay, well, for now

13:33.580 --> 13:36.016
all we know is that he's agreed
to show up for a meeting.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.919
-And he is making us late.
-He's here.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.727
THUNDERBIRD:
Erg.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.330
-Thanks for coming.
-Where are we going?

13:50.363 --> 13:51.831
ECLIPSE:
Uh, Evangeline is meeting

13:51.865 --> 13:54.902
other leaders of the Underground
at a safe location.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.469
We're here to take you there.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.837
-Then let's go.
-Okay.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.874
Look at us. Best friends.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.879
We're on our way.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.648
-So he will help?
-Well, he's coming.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.717
What about the other stations?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.352
(sighs)
Richmond. Cleveland.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.188
A handful from Newark
are gonna be there.

14:15.222 --> 14:18.258
-And that's all?
-Yeah, that's it for now.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.494
-At this point, it's all
riding on this meeting.
-(sighs) Damn it.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.197
All right, thanks.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.200
(sighs)

15:03.236 --> 15:06.239
(music box playing
Schubert's "Erlking")

15:06.273 --> 15:08.075
(laughs softly)

15:10.410 --> 15:12.079
(laughs softly)

15:12.112 --> 15:14.781
("Erlking" continues)

15:28.828 --> 15:32.432
(music box playing "Erlking")

15:43.943 --> 15:46.946
-("Erlking" continues)
-No. No.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.317
No.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.853
Oh, God, no.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.189
(straining)

15:58.158 --> 15:59.659
-(grunts)
-(music stops)

15:59.692 --> 16:02.862
(panting)

16:29.922 --> 16:31.891
LAUREN:
I got to say,

16:31.924 --> 16:34.461
I like you as a brunette.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.895
(chuckles):
Oh.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.965
I have spent too many Sundays
with this crowd.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.634
I don't want anyone
to recognize me.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.003
LAUREN: You really think
Uncle Danny's gonna be here?

16:44.037 --> 16:46.206
(chuckles)
My brother hasn't missed church

16:46.239 --> 16:48.141
since I was
a 14-year-old wild child.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.744
Though I'm pretty sure he used
to go just to make me look bad.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.180
(chuckles)

16:54.047 --> 16:55.848
I wish I knew you then.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.218
(laughs)
When I was fun?

17:01.954 --> 17:03.156
-LAUREN: Is that him?
-Hey.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.391
-How you been?
-Great seeing you today.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.193
He looks...

17:06.226 --> 17:07.560
different.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.863
Yeah. All right.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.699
Stay here.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.167
Keep out of sight.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.002
DANNY: Yeah, well,
you know, we're always hoping

17:16.035 --> 17:18.004
to get people involved,
so, you know,

17:18.037 --> 17:19.739
feel free to... check it out.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.542
If you're a golfer, too, we
have this fund-raiser in June.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.876
That's always a lot of fun,

17:23.910 --> 17:25.445
-so think about that.
-Thank you.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.347
-All right.
-WOMAN: Thank you, Danny.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.515
CAITLIN:
Hey, Danny.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.716
(gasps)

17:29.749 --> 17:31.751
-My God.
-Okay, calm down.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.220
-I thought you were...
-Don't make a scene.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.854
We-we had a funeral
and everything.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.756
They told me you were all dead.

17:36.789 --> 17:37.990
Not yet.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.960
Danny, we need your help.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.036
I know you're not happy
about this,

17:50.069 --> 17:52.372
but thank you for helping us.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.442
Evangeline didn't leave me
much choice.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.043
ECLIPSE: It's not like
she put a gun to your head.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.111
She saved your life in Dallas.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.879
Is that what she told you?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.415
-Yeah.
-BLINK: Why?

18:02.449 --> 18:03.750
Is that not true?

18:03.783 --> 18:05.152
It's true enough.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.587
But she left out
some of the story.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.088
After the 7/15 disaster,

18:09.122 --> 18:14.227
Evangeline and I founded
the Underground together.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.829
Yeah. I moved people
through the tunnels.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.299
She organized the surface.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.001
Working together
to protect our people.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.304
Evangeline never told me that.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.672
Nah. She wouldn't.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.674
BLINK:
Well, what happened?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.809
We were betrayed by a human ally

18:29.842 --> 18:33.012
while moving mutants
over the border.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.916
I watched them get slaughtered,
trying to help them,

18:36.949 --> 18:39.319
till Evangeline pulled me away.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.822
After, I argued that we could
no longer trust the humans,

18:42.855 --> 18:45.458
that we needed
our own communities, but...

18:45.492 --> 18:47.260
she disagreed.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.429
I left.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.764
The Morlocks
and the Mutant Underground

18:51.798 --> 18:53.333
went our separate ways.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.034
I mean, you're coming
to the meeting.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.604
-You must believe something...
-Don't tell me what I believe.

18:57.637 --> 19:01.841
Make no mistake-- Evangeline's
invitation was a threat.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.109
BLINK:
Threat?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.344
What did she threaten you with?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.846
She knows where
all our tunnels are.

19:06.879 --> 19:10.483
She made it clear
that we could join you,

19:10.517 --> 19:12.018
or she would expose us.

19:12.051 --> 19:15.222
Come on. She wouldn't really
do that, would she?

19:15.255 --> 19:16.723
She wouldn't.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.694
Man, that's messed up.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.030
Look, I understand you're angry.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.899
But this is
all of our fight now.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.369
This fight's a suicide mission.
I want no part of it.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.404
I'm only here
to protect my people.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.544
MILES: Clarice! Lilly!
Where the hell are they?

19:37.577 --> 19:39.145
These little freaks
can't have just disappeared.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.180
Clarice, we got to go back.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.515
What are you talking about?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.217
MILES: Pete, Freddy,
get your lazy asses up.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.553
We can't just leave
Pete and Freddy.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.688
We have to go back.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.357
Do you know what he'll do to us?

19:50.390 --> 19:52.525
I know what he'll do to them
because we left.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.562
I can't let that happen.
I have to stop him.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.029
You can't.
Not when he's this mad.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.699
He's a bully and a coward.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.368
We have to stand up to him.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.369
Lilly, please.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.903
Just get me inside there,
Clarice.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.972
I can face him.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.242
Please.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.212
(shudders)

20:18.885 --> 20:20.420
DANNY:
Despite the circumstances,

20:20.453 --> 20:21.388
a lot of people came.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.356
We had a nice service
up at the church,

20:23.390 --> 20:25.925
and then we all walked down here
to pay our respects.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.127
You would've loved it; we played
your favorite nocturne.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.363
That wasn't my favorite.
That was Mom's.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.199
She made me practice it
on the piano until I hated it.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.867
Oh, you're gonna bust me
on the details of your funeral

20:34.901 --> 20:36.403
that you didn't even bother
to show up for?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.271
(scoffs)

20:39.806 --> 20:41.040
I didn't tell you
to protect you.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.042
-I know.
-I-I wanted to,

20:43.075 --> 20:45.244
but I-I couldn't.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.414
So, why are you
telling me now, then?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.248
Uncle Danny...

20:49.282 --> 20:50.783
there's a situation.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.251
We need your help.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.220
You need my help?
What can I do?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.556
Your law firm does work
for Homeland Security, right?

20:56.589 --> 20:57.990
Yes, but I don't have any...

20:58.024 --> 20:59.659
They monitor extremist groups.

20:59.692 --> 21:00.993
We have information

21:01.027 --> 21:02.295
on a terrorist attack
that's coming.

21:02.329 --> 21:05.498
You want me to contact
Homeland Security for you?

21:05.532 --> 21:07.600
The last time I helped you,
I nearly lost everything.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.436
I almost got caught.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.739
-We just want you to see
what you can find out.
-Oh, my God.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.074
Danny, thousands of lives
are at stake.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.242
Do you watch the news?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.510
Attacks are happening
all the time.

21:17.544 --> 21:18.845
Why should we get involved?

21:22.315 --> 21:23.850
We're already involved.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.386
Andy's one of the terrorists.

21:30.189 --> 21:32.659
ESME:
We spoke to Reeva.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.794
She needs to know
the second this is done.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.095
We got it.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.664
SOPHIE: The time window
for this is small.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.666
You know the targets.
Just them.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.100
No more, no less.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.503
No mistakes.
Nice and clean.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.871
HEATHER:
We don't make mistakes.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.339
PHOEBE:
Hmm. Don't get cocky.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.040
Remember, a week ago,
you were all in prison.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.842
MAX: Yeah, and the first thing
we did when we got out

21:49.876 --> 21:52.512
is kill the guy
that put us there.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.280
Nice and clean.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.715
SOPHIE:
The chopper's waiting.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.890
Ah. Off to the big mystery job?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.692
MAX:
That's right.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.060
Need any backup?

22:08.094 --> 22:11.230
I think we can handle it.

22:11.263 --> 22:14.467
-Well, what if I have to come
to your rescue?
-Oh...

22:14.501 --> 22:16.636
there'll be no need for that.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.505
We're just gonna go slay
a dragon.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.507
(elevator bell chimes)

22:20.540 --> 22:22.442
(elevator doors open)

22:33.219 --> 22:35.187
(line rings)

22:35.221 --> 22:38.090
Lorna, what's going on?
I thought we said no calls.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.259
POLARIS (on phone):
We did, but there's no time.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.529
Reeva's new recruits--
I think she just sent them

22:42.562 --> 22:43.696
to kill Evangeline.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.898
-What? Are you sure?
-All I know

22:45.932 --> 22:48.267
is that Max made a crack
about slaying a dragon.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.036
I mean, who else do you know
that breathes smoke

22:50.069 --> 22:51.871
and has hands
that turn into talons?

22:52.572 --> 22:53.606
ECLIPSE:
When?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.341
They just left.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.909
In a helicopter.

22:56.943 --> 22:59.011
-(knock on door)
-I got to go.

22:59.045 --> 22:59.879
Yeah.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.014
-Can we call Evangeline?
-No.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.349
She's with the upper leadership.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.251
-They're radio silent.
-What's going on?

23:05.284 --> 23:06.786
The Inner Circle
just sent a hit team

23:06.819 --> 23:08.187
in a helicopter to the meeting.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.589
THUNDERBIRD:
We got to get there first.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.390
-Hang on.
-(engine revving)

23:17.464 --> 23:20.032
-Hey, I've been looking for you.
-I skipped training.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.300
It's been a zoo down there.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.936
You, uh, okay?
Am I interrupting something?

23:23.970 --> 23:26.405
No. No, not at all.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.740
What's-what's going on?

23:27.774 --> 23:29.275
Um, well,
it's-it's about Lauren.

23:29.308 --> 23:33.412
Um, the Frosts want me
to reach out to her

23:33.446 --> 23:36.883
and get her to come here,
you know, and join us.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.051
Okay, that doesn't seem
like Lauren.

23:39.085 --> 23:43.656
Yeah, I know, but they said
there's ways that they can help.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.091
Like with their powers.

23:45.124 --> 23:48.327
I guess I was
just wondering if, um,

23:48.360 --> 23:50.830
if you would try something
like that.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.466
If you could get Marcos
to come here.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.603
Marcos would hate it here.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.971
And he's made it very clear
that he does not believe

23:59.005 --> 24:00.272
in what we're doing.

24:00.306 --> 24:03.209
Yeah, but what if you could
make him believe?

24:04.677 --> 24:05.845
I mean, you'd be together.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.581
I don't think it's possible

24:08.615 --> 24:10.717
to make someone truly believe.

24:12.384 --> 24:14.721
Not even for the Frosts.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.025
(sighs)

24:28.701 --> 24:30.870
ANDREAS: Everything becomes
and recurs eternally.

24:30.903 --> 24:34.006
Escape is impossible.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.878
The power will rise
in our family line once again.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.346
We were meant to dominate.

24:40.379 --> 24:43.516
-And so we shall.
-(grunting)

24:43.550 --> 24:45.217
That will to power lives in us.

24:45.251 --> 24:48.855
If you're reading this,
you know it in yourself.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.690
You have felt it in there.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.625
Do not fear it
nor hide from it.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.661
-Because that is who you are.
-(door opens)

24:54.694 --> 24:56.128
-OTTO: Reed.
-(door closes)

24:56.162 --> 24:58.064
Reed! What are you doing?

24:59.566 --> 25:01.367
This is not for you.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.735
You never touch that, boy.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.504
Stay away from it.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.807
ANDREAS:
Embrace the power.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.876
You are a Von Strucker.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.410
It is your destiny.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.887
(groaning)

25:26.358 --> 25:29.228
(typing)

25:30.697 --> 25:33.332
What's your take
on the new recruits?

25:33.365 --> 25:36.736
Impressive. And we don't even
know their full potential yet.

25:36.769 --> 25:40.573
Any news yet on how their
mysterious little mission went?

25:40.607 --> 25:42.041
I don't know anything about it.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.611
Neither should you.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.445
Just asking.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.047
ESME:
Lorna.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.050
Just the person
I was looking for.

25:54.654 --> 25:57.924
I heard you had a chat
with Andy.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.627
He wanted some advice.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.728
About his sister.

26:01.761 --> 26:04.296
-She came up.
-Hmm.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.766
And what wisdom did you share
with him, exactly?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.570
Just the truth.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.105
It's hard enough in here
on people

26:13.139 --> 26:15.041
who actually believe
in what we're doing.

26:15.074 --> 26:19.111
I don't think you understand
the situation here, Lorna.

26:19.145 --> 26:23.149
With Reeva, you're either
with her or against her.

26:23.182 --> 26:27.253
That goes for Lauren
and that goes for you.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.490
That a threat?

26:31.523 --> 26:34.460
(laughs softly) Just the truth.

26:34.493 --> 26:35.995
Lorna,

26:36.028 --> 26:40.299
I care about your little girl.
You know that.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.302
And I want her to grow up
and know her mother someday.

26:43.335 --> 26:47.707
Please, stay out of things
that don't concern you.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.682
(sirens wailing)

26:55.715 --> 26:57.183
(indistinct shouting)

26:57.216 --> 26:58.985
Hey.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.028
THUNDERBIRD:
Oh, my God.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.965
(indistinct chatter)

27:12.999 --> 27:14.767
We got to get down there.

27:14.801 --> 27:15.935
John. John, John,
stop, stop, stop.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.136
Evangeline might still be
down there!

27:17.169 --> 27:18.270
It's too late. It's too late.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.206
They're pulling bodies out
of that building, John.

27:20.239 --> 27:23.710
Can you hear any of our people?
Anything?

27:36.522 --> 27:38.057
I'm so sorry.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.863
ERG:
We need to go. This is over.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.331
It can't be over.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.033
That was the entire
national leadership

27:47.066 --> 27:48.634
of the Underground, John.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.902
THUNDERBIRD:
We still have stations.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.371
With the help of your people...

27:52.404 --> 27:53.706
My people?

27:53.740 --> 27:56.743
My people will have nothing
to do with this.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.310
Y-You're gonna turn your back?

27:58.344 --> 27:59.478
This is not our fight.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.247
-ECLIPSE:
You saw what just happened.
-ERG: I did.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.582
And I will not let the same
thing happen to the Morlocks.

28:03.615 --> 28:06.886
-Oh, come on!
-Evangeline saved my life,
and she saved yours.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.855
You're just gonna stand around

28:08.888 --> 28:10.422
while the Inner Circle
murders people?

28:10.456 --> 28:12.992
Let's just take a breath.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.562
Okay, we are all
on the same side here.

28:16.595 --> 28:17.864
I'm afraid we're not, Blink.

28:17.897 --> 28:20.199
Her name is Clarice!

28:20.232 --> 28:23.035
All right, you bet your ass
we're not on the same side.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.271
While you're down there,
hiding in the sewers,

28:25.304 --> 28:27.339
we're up here fighting
in the real world!

28:27.373 --> 28:28.775
The real world?

28:28.808 --> 28:32.111
You mean where we're feared
a-and hated?

28:32.144 --> 28:34.613
Where Blink, the woman you claim
to love, has to hide who she is?

28:34.646 --> 28:35.915
(grunts)

28:41.220 --> 28:42.521
Don't!

28:42.554 --> 28:44.924
(shouts)

28:44.957 --> 28:47.359
You son of a bitch!
You want to lose your other eye?

28:47.393 --> 28:48.527
-Huh?
-Stop.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.529
Both of you.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.697
One war's enough.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.966
(panting)

28:59.071 --> 29:00.439
LAUREN:
We're meeting Uncle Danny here?

29:00.472 --> 29:04.543
Well, it's the safest place
we could think of.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.478
Kind of random.

29:06.512 --> 29:11.117
Well, in high school, this used
to be the favorite make-out spot

29:11.150 --> 29:14.420
because it was easy to see
if the cops were coming.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.289
Who did you make out with?

29:17.323 --> 29:18.791
(laughs)

29:18.825 --> 29:22.394
-I don't kiss and tell.
-Mm.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.763
Fine.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.666
And how many times did you kiss
and not tell?

29:27.699 --> 29:30.436
-Five?
-Mm.

29:30.469 --> 29:31.971
-Ten?
-(stifled laugh)

29:32.004 --> 29:34.440
-15? Seriously?
-Okay, look...

29:34.473 --> 29:35.741
(laughs)

29:35.774 --> 29:37.844
Wow.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.578
Who are you, and what have
you done with my mom?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.914
(laughing)

29:41.948 --> 29:43.449
So you weren't
always good, then?

29:43.482 --> 29:46.152
Oh, far from it.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.354
(sighs)

29:48.387 --> 29:50.322
Why do you ask?

29:50.356 --> 29:53.292
I had a dream with Andy
last night.

29:53.325 --> 29:56.362
We got into a fight.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.663
He was attacking you?

29:57.696 --> 29:59.031
Actually,

29:59.065 --> 30:02.668
I attacked him, and I won.

30:02.701 --> 30:05.504
I don't know
how I feel about it.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.841
Oh, honey, I can't say
that makes me happy,

30:08.875 --> 30:11.343
but you've been given
this power,

30:11.377 --> 30:16.015
and... it's up to you to decide
what to do with it.

30:16.048 --> 30:19.818
-I know you'll do what's right.
-(vehicle approaching)

30:21.487 --> 30:23.822
That's Danny.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.257
Let's go.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.128
Thank you for coming, Danny.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.729
I know this was a huge risk.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.131
No, I don't think you do.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.133
This-this thing you asked me
to look into,

30:34.166 --> 30:36.435
it is so much bigger
than you can imagine.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.271
Bigger how?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.408
I know this is hard.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.310
I-I wouldn't have come to you
if we had another choice.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.413
You're... you're the only person
who can help us.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.215
The-the only one we can trust.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.717
(groans)

30:51.750 --> 30:54.186
-You know what? I can't do this.
-What is it?

30:57.256 --> 30:59.125
What is that?

31:01.293 --> 31:02.995
-Oh, my God.
-Listen, they're gonna be
here soon.

31:03.029 --> 31:05.064
-Lauren, let's go.
-DANNY: I-I tried
to ask around quietly, but I...

31:05.097 --> 31:06.432
CAITLIN:
Danny, how could you?

31:06.465 --> 31:07.533
...I kicked the hornet's nest.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.535
Cait. Cait! They knew.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.670
They knew everything.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.440
Look, I'm so sorry. I...

31:14.473 --> 31:15.641
They didn't give me a choice.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.409
I was supposed to capture
everything I could on the wire.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.245
-Who did you talk to?
-It was a friend of mine
at Homeland.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.047
I asked if they had anything
on Benedict Ryan.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.348
-We need to go.
-No, listen, listen, listen.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.749
There's something you need
to know.

31:23.782 --> 31:25.417
Ryan is not just a talking head,
all right?

31:25.451 --> 31:27.186
He's secretly running
the Purifiers.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.788
LAUREN: What did they say
about the Inner Circle?

31:29.821 --> 31:32.058
-Reeva Payge?
-I don't know.

31:32.091 --> 31:35.194
But they had me in cuffs 20
minutes after I brought her up.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.696
They have people
in the government?

31:37.729 --> 31:40.866
Homeland Security's compromised.
Attorney General's office.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.534
I don't know,
maybe even Congress.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.370
-MAN: This is Sentinel Services.
-DANNY: Oh, God.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.737
-Surrender immediately.
-It's too late.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.739
No, it's not.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.909
Get in the car.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.016
(sirens wailing)

32:02.521 --> 32:05.357
(shouting indistinctly)

32:12.531 --> 32:14.366
Lauren!

32:16.202 --> 32:18.104
Fire!

32:22.674 --> 32:24.176
(tires screeching)

32:30.682 --> 32:33.652
SOPHIE:
Andy, can we talk to you?

32:33.685 --> 32:36.488
-I-Is there something wrong
with Lauren?
-ESME: Why?

32:36.522 --> 32:37.990
-Did you feel something?
-Yeah.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.791
My heart is beating
out of my chest.

32:39.825 --> 32:42.028
I-I mean, I'm sweating.
I never sweat.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.430
You know we monitor
Sentinel Services activity.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.697
Well, there was an incident.

32:45.731 --> 32:48.000
A few minutes ago,
your mom and sister...

32:48.034 --> 32:49.201
-Are they okay?
-ESME: It's sounds like

32:49.235 --> 32:52.171
-they got away.
-But it was a very close call.

32:52.204 --> 32:53.672
(exhales)

32:53.705 --> 32:56.008
They're fine, Andy.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.443
But Lauren is in danger.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.146
This is why you should let us
help you reach out to her.

33:01.913 --> 33:04.550
Yeah, I-I've been thinking
about that and, um,

33:04.583 --> 33:06.318
if she's going to be here,

33:06.352 --> 33:08.187
she should at least believe
in what we're doing.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.222
-I mean, manipulating her
is not...
-Manipulating?

33:10.256 --> 33:12.958
Who said anything
about manipulating?

33:12.991 --> 33:15.394
Andy, we only want to help
your family.

33:15.427 --> 33:18.364
Your mother and sister almost
got themselves killed today.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.365
And your father...

33:19.398 --> 33:21.467
What about my father?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.001
We did some investigating.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.003
Turns out there's something
wrong with his powers.

33:25.037 --> 33:26.838
He said he had his medicine.

33:26.872 --> 33:29.241
And when it runs out
or stops working?

33:29.275 --> 33:32.244
Andy, we have access
to the best doctors.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.746
He'd have everything
he needed here.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.415
My parents are-are...

33:36.448 --> 33:38.084
If your sister joins us,

33:38.117 --> 33:40.219
your parents
won't be far behind.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.855
Andy, you can save Lauren,

33:43.889 --> 33:45.424
your family.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.426
You can save them all.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.033
John, we should roll.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.569
Well, how you holding up, Rocky?

33:57.603 --> 33:59.605
Ow.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.007
What the hell was that?

34:02.040 --> 34:05.244
Erg redirects the force
of attacks used against him.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.879
So you basically
punched yourself.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.016
Can't say you didn't deserve it.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.120
I'm-I'm tired of his excuses.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.788
Look, I know.

34:19.091 --> 34:21.893
I know how hard it must be,
losing Evangeline.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.365
But Erg is just
trying to protect

34:26.398 --> 34:28.267
the people he cares about,
same as you.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.270
He's a coward. He's running
from the fight, Clarice.

34:31.303 --> 34:34.440
And that's what this is about--
bravery?

34:40.512 --> 34:43.315
You know who the bravest person
I ever knew was?

34:45.351 --> 34:47.219
My foster sister Lilly.

34:47.253 --> 34:50.088
We lived with this bastard
who, who took us in

34:50.122 --> 34:52.658
for the extra 50 bucks a week
you get for taking care

34:52.691 --> 34:54.493
of a kid with an X-Gene.

34:54.526 --> 34:58.964
And he used to beat
the crap out of us.

34:58.997 --> 35:01.333
-You never told me that.
-I'm telling you now.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.169
The night that we escaped,
she decided

35:03.202 --> 35:05.671
to go back for the other kids,

35:05.704 --> 35:08.674
because someone
had to stand up to him.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.342
And what happened?

35:10.376 --> 35:14.012
She was just a little kid.

35:14.045 --> 35:16.848
He had a hundred pounds on her.
He knocked her down,

35:16.882 --> 35:19.851
she hit her head on the side of
the table and broke her neck.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.820
-(thud)
-FOSTER MOM:
What did you do, Miles?

35:21.853 --> 35:24.022
Oh, my God!

35:25.191 --> 35:29.695
She was dead before
the ambulance got there.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.833
She was my best friend.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.603
She was my sister,
and I lost her.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.006
Running into a battle you know
you're gonna lose isn't noble

35:41.039 --> 35:44.510
-or brave; it's selfish.
-Clarice...

35:44.543 --> 35:46.478
And that's what you're doing.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.014
You ran off,
you got taken by the Purifiers.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.949
We barely have you back,
and now you're just off

35:50.982 --> 35:53.018
-to the next impossible battle.
-Clarice, please,

35:53.051 --> 35:55.020
I can't just walk away
from this. I can't walk away

35:55.053 --> 35:57.689
and let everything we've built
be destroyed.

35:57.723 --> 36:00.226
I know.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.363
And I love you too much
to watch you kill yourself.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.999
So there we are.

36:08.033 --> 36:11.002
What are you saying?

36:23.515 --> 36:26.184
I'm saying good-bye.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.981
(exhales)

36:57.649 --> 36:59.918
You should try
to get some sleep.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.854
We still got a long way to go.

37:02.888 --> 37:06.358
I tried. I don't think I can.

37:06.392 --> 37:09.428
You're worried
you're gonna have another dream.

37:09.461 --> 37:12.030
It's not just that.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.700
What I did when
Sentinel Services showed up,

37:14.733 --> 37:17.369
-if you hadn't stopped me...
-You did what you had to do.

37:17.403 --> 37:22.040
If you hadn't,
we'd be in prison... or worse.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.642
I know.

37:23.675 --> 37:24.810
I wasn't myself anymore.

37:26.312 --> 37:29.448
It was so strange.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.417
You know what I saw?

37:31.450 --> 37:36.187
A powerful woman
with a very special gift.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.492
A gift for chopping up
police cars.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.160
You think that's a good thing?

37:42.193 --> 37:45.397
Uh, I mean...

37:45.431 --> 37:48.800
you were protecting your family.

37:49.868 --> 37:53.038
I'm proud of you, Lauren.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.579
And, um, maybe we should
just keep the whole

38:00.612 --> 38:03.749
shootout with the cops thing
between us, you know?

38:03.782 --> 38:08.854
These days, uh,
stress is bad for your dad.

38:13.392 --> 38:16.194
(car door closes)

38:17.363 --> 38:18.664
What happened?

38:18.697 --> 38:21.333
Well, we, uh, we were too late.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.702
I'm sorry.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.405
I know Evangeline meant
a lot to you.

38:29.207 --> 38:31.142
No, I...

38:31.176 --> 38:32.811
you know,
I couldn't stand her, actually.

38:32.844 --> 38:33.879
(laughs softly)

38:33.912 --> 38:37.215
Never liked lawyers or dragons.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.455
But she saved me
when no one else would.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.991
And I paid her back
by joining up with the people

38:46.024 --> 38:48.059
who killed her. God.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.297
You know, for what it's worth,
she knew you were on our side.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.300
She thought it was
the only reason we might win.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.505
Look, there's something
you should know.

38:59.538 --> 39:02.908
-Yeah.
-Um, Reeva,

39:02.941 --> 39:06.344
the Frosts, they want Lauren.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.680
If they got both of them,
Marcos,

39:08.714 --> 39:11.016
I don't want to even think
about what they could do.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.051
We can't let that happen.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.053
For so long,
all that kept me going

39:15.086 --> 39:19.090
is the thought
that someday, somehow,

39:19.124 --> 39:22.428
you, me and Dawn
could all be together.

39:24.295 --> 39:25.997
And now I just feel
like it's slipping

39:26.031 --> 39:28.266
further and further away
from me.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.969
No, no, we'll, uh...

39:33.572 --> 39:35.206
...we'll get there.

39:35.240 --> 39:39.277
Well, I should go
before they notice I'm gone.

39:39.310 --> 39:40.779
-Yeah.
-Okay.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.950
-Stay safe.
-You, too.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.772
ERG:
You'll get used to it.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.375
BLINK:
Sure about that?

40:10.408 --> 40:14.646
It tastes like cornflakes
and glue.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.648
-(laughs softly)
-Sorry.

40:16.682 --> 40:18.784
I'm not here for the cuisine.

40:18.817 --> 40:21.553
Thank you for taking me in.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.388
You made a brave choice today.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.792
-Doesn't feel that way.
-You gave up your life,

40:26.825 --> 40:29.360
everything you know,
a man you love...

40:31.530 --> 40:32.998
...all for what you believe.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.201
I can't imagine anything
braver than that.

40:37.536 --> 40:40.438
Didn't think that bravery
would feel this crappy.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.275
Look around.

40:44.309 --> 40:48.046
This, this is
your community now.

40:49.515 --> 40:52.150
You brought your gifts,

40:52.183 --> 40:55.120
and now every single one
of these people is safer

40:55.153 --> 40:57.388
because you're one of us now.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.131
Welcome home, Blink.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.556
You sure you're feeling okay?

41:30.589 --> 41:34.025
-I'm fine. Why do you ask?
-I just could've sworn there was

41:34.059 --> 41:36.695
more of this serum when we left.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.564
I'm fine, honestly.

41:38.597 --> 41:41.733
I'm more worried about you guys.

41:43.268 --> 41:45.837
I don't understand how
you were quite able to escape

41:45.871 --> 41:48.006
the Sentinel Services. I mean,

41:48.039 --> 41:51.710
a full ambush and you were able
to just drive away?

41:51.743 --> 41:54.813
-We got lucky.
-CAITLIN: It was close,

41:54.846 --> 41:56.682
but Danny warned us in time.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.584
He's got friends in high places.

41:58.617 --> 42:01.519
Hopefully, th-they can help.
