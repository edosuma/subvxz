WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.750 --> 00:08.041
I was thinking
how I keep waiting

00:08.083 --> 00:10.917
for life to get easier.

00:10.959 --> 00:13.166
You know? Lower stakes.

00:13.208 --> 00:15.041
Less risk, more reward.
Easier.

00:15.083 --> 00:20.667
And I was thinking
that maybe it doesn't.

00:20.709 --> 00:23.041
I was thinking that maybe
the struggle, the climb,

00:23.083 --> 00:26.333
the one obstacle after another,
maybe

00:26.375 --> 00:29.000
that's just life.

00:29.041 --> 00:31.875
( mid-tempo
pop music playing )

00:35.834 --> 00:37.917
( stopwatch ticking )

00:41.917 --> 00:43.041
Done.
Done.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.208
Eighty-eight seconds.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.041
Hmm.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.250
Can I call Cooper now?

00:47.291 --> 00:49.375
You can call Cooper now.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.041
VIOLET:
Nights when Lucas
stays with Pete used to mean

00:56.083 --> 00:58.041
a long, hot,
uninterrupted bath.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.166
But this is so much better.
Yeah?

01:00.208 --> 01:02.583
( Violet laughs )

01:02.625 --> 01:04.500
Well, I'm gonna take
a half day tomorrow.

01:04.542 --> 01:07.917
Yay! I'm gonna come home
for lunch, I'll see you then.

01:07.959 --> 01:10.250
I was thinking maybe you'd
bring Lucas to the fire station.

01:10.291 --> 01:12.959
That'd be the coolest place
he's ever been.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.041
That's really sweet.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.375
Oh...

01:18.417 --> 01:21.000
( both laugh )

01:21.041 --> 01:22.041
That was really dismissive.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.458
That's not how I meant it--

01:23.500 --> 01:25.792
No? How--? No?
How did you mean it?

01:25.834 --> 01:31.834
Ow. Look, you make me happy,
Violet.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.208
And I'm ready
for this to be more.

01:33.250 --> 01:38.041
I want you to meet my friends.
I wanna get to know your son.

01:38.083 --> 01:41.041
I want your toothbrush
in my bathroom.

01:41.083 --> 01:43.041
I'm ready
for it to be real.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.750
Is that what you want?

01:48.583 --> 01:51.959
Is it Pete?
I-- Scott, I-- I--

01:52.000 --> 01:54.709
I like you. I like this.
Yeah?

01:56.083 --> 01:58.875
But my life is--
It's complicated.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.917
Everyone's life
is complicated.

02:00.959 --> 02:05.667
The question is, do you want me
to be a part of yours?

02:08.417 --> 02:09.500
SHELDON:
How you feeling now?

02:09.542 --> 02:10.542
Good.

02:10.583 --> 02:13.667
Really good.
And I'm so grateful.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.792
I was a zombie
and you woke me up.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.041
Well, the wrong medication
can make everything worse.

02:18.083 --> 02:19.667
But now
that the fog has lifted,

02:19.709 --> 02:22.250
we can work toward
a proper diagnosis.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.709
Well, today, right now,
I feel normal.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.750
I got up at 6,
I did a load of Sam's laundry,

02:27.792 --> 02:29.792
I alphabetized
his bookshelves.

02:29.834 --> 02:31.959
Heh. I don't know about you,

02:32.000 --> 02:33.250
but I hate when people's books

02:33.291 --> 02:35.583
are just randomly stuffed
in there.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.083
You're looking for one,
you can't find it.

02:37.125 --> 02:38.500
Okay.

02:38.542 --> 02:42.041
Then I went for a run,
and I looked at the ocean.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.583
And I didn't just stare at it.
I really...

02:44.625 --> 02:45.917
I really saw it.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.500
Well, that's a lot
for a morning.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.041
Yeah, well, I have 20 years
to make up for.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.709
For myself
and for my brother.

02:52.750 --> 02:55.041
I want us to be closer
but...

02:55.083 --> 02:56.792
I don't know how to--

02:56.834 --> 03:00.041
You can always talk to me,
Corinne. Always.

03:00.083 --> 03:02.291
I'm just not sure
where to start.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.417
I mean, what to leave out.

03:03.458 --> 03:06.041
There's a lot
that I am not proud of.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.125
SHELDON:
Well, that was your past

03:07.166 --> 03:09.125
and perhaps as we get
more comfortable,

03:09.166 --> 03:10.417
we can address that.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.041
Why don't we focus on
what's happening now?

03:12.083 --> 03:13.959
I'm ready to start over.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.041
To have the kind of life
that everyone else has.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.917
Well, that's something
to work toward.

03:19.041 --> 03:21.542
Oh, that sounds
oddly patronizing.

03:21.583 --> 03:22.834
No. Wait, wait.

03:22.875 --> 03:24.875
You're saying
you don't think

03:24.917 --> 03:27.250
that she can get there or...?

03:27.291 --> 03:30.792
It's important to understand
our limitations.

03:30.834 --> 03:32.041
That goes for all of us.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.875
You're not listening.
I'm not crazy.

03:34.917 --> 03:39.000
This is me. I'm back now,
and there's nothing I can't do.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.041
As Amy has told you,

03:46.083 --> 03:47.792
gliosarcomas
are very aggressive tumors

03:47.834 --> 03:49.291
that don't respond well
to treatment.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.291
And what's the plan?

03:50.333 --> 03:52.083
We're gonna insert
vascular balloons

03:52.125 --> 03:54.709
into your brain and bypass
the large blood vessel

03:54.750 --> 03:56.250
that's infiltrated
by the tumor.

03:56.291 --> 03:57.458
Our hope is to preserve

03:57.500 --> 03:59.417
the healthy brain tissue
and remove the tumor.

03:59.458 --> 04:00.417
What's the catch?

04:00.458 --> 04:02.625
We only have 90 seconds
to do it.

04:03.667 --> 04:04.667
What?

04:04.709 --> 04:06.166
DEREK:
After 90 seconds with no blood,

04:06.208 --> 04:08.458
Erica's brain tissue
starts to die.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.875
We'd be causing a stroke.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.041
CHARLOTTE:
Ninety seconds.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.041
Can you do that?

04:12.083 --> 04:14.041
Not alone.
But working together--

04:14.083 --> 04:16.291
They've done it
in the practice suite. Twice.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.333
Twice.
AMELIA: Twice so far,

04:23.375 --> 04:24.333
and we'll keep practicing.

04:24.375 --> 04:25.542
Erica, I'm not gonna
lie to you,

04:25.583 --> 04:26.667
this has never been done.

04:26.709 --> 04:28.875
It's risky.
But I believe we can do it.

04:28.917 --> 04:31.208
Maybe you wanna take
a few more days to practice.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.667
Try and get that number up.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.125
DEREK:
Unfortunately,
time is critical.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.041
We have to remove the tumor
before it's too big.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.750
When?
Today.

04:37.792 --> 04:39.959
( tender theme playing )

04:40.000 --> 04:41.333
You wanna try surgery on me

04:41.375 --> 04:44.041
that's never been successful
today?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.041
And if you fail,
my brain dies.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.291
That's what we're saying?

04:48.333 --> 04:50.542
You have
two world-class surgeons

04:50.583 --> 04:53.750
telling you you have a chance.
Two days ago you had none.

04:53.792 --> 04:57.083
You have to take that chance.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.583
I need a day.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.333
I have a son who's stuck
watching TV with the nurse

05:01.375 --> 05:06.709
with no idea what's happening,
so, ahem, I need a day.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.000
Okay.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.709
Book the OR.
First thing tomorrow.

05:20.166 --> 05:23.500
PARAMEDIC:
On my count. One, two...

05:23.542 --> 05:25.000
Dr. Bennett,
we were watching TV,

05:25.041 --> 05:26.500
then Gloria
couldn't catch her breath.

05:26.542 --> 05:27.917
PARAMEDIC:
Sudden onset of dyspnea.

05:27.959 --> 05:30.625
No associated chest pain
or palpitations. Tachy at 120.

05:30.667 --> 05:33.125
Cardiac panel, enzymes,
portable chest.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.917
She's also
30 weeks pregnant.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.792
What? She's pregnant?
She didn't wanna tell you.

05:37.834 --> 05:39.709
Because you knew
it wasn't supposed to happen.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.917
I'm so sorry.
( monitor beeping )

05:41.959 --> 05:43.291
High flow O2, 100 percent.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.041
Dr. Bennett.
What's going on?

05:45.083 --> 05:46.917
She's in congestive
heart failure.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.917
What are you doing here?
I'm the IVF doctor.

05:48.959 --> 05:51.792
Dr. Reilly gave us our baby.
Wait, what were you thinking?

05:51.834 --> 05:54.083
You know how dangerous it is
for her to carry a baby now.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.041
It was routine.
No contraindications.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.792
Well, I gave her
a donor heart.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.041
Started working with her
before I joined the practice.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.458
She never mentioned
anything.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.458
Don't you do physical
examinations on patients

06:04.500 --> 06:07.041
before you knock them up?
I do a gynecological exam.

06:07.083 --> 06:08.041
Gloria's was normal. She--

06:08.083 --> 06:10.041
I expect my patients
to be forthright

06:10.083 --> 06:11.041
with their health.
She wasn't.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.583
Fine.
You can rely on whatever--

06:13.625 --> 06:16.208
Oh. Am I interrupting?
Yes.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.834
No. Jake did IVF on one
of my heart transplant patients.

06:18.875 --> 06:20.041
Not knowingly.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.041
Well, that is either crazy
or irresponsible.

06:22.083 --> 06:23.125
Could you please
back me up on this?

06:23.166 --> 06:25.041
I just came in
to get a yogurt.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.041
JAKE: No, no. Weigh in on this.
SAM: Addie, no, no.

06:27.083 --> 06:28.625
JAKE:
I helped out a patient
who lied

06:28.667 --> 06:30.041
that she had
no preexisting conditions.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.917
After he happened to miss

06:31.959 --> 06:33.500
the zipper scar right down
the middle of her chest.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.375
I don't ask my patients
to disrobe entirely

06:35.417 --> 06:37.375
when I'm doing
a routine fertility evaluation.

06:37.417 --> 06:39.041
Do you? Want me to start?
Okay.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.291
It doesn't matter
how we got here.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.041
What matters
is keeping your patient alive

06:42.083 --> 06:43.583
and giving the baby
a fighting chance.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.458
She's 30 weeks.
That's viable.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
We deliver now--

06:46.542 --> 06:47.875
We know
there's a big difference

06:47.917 --> 06:49.709
between viable and healthy.
We can't wait.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.041
We need to give this baby
a chance.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.041
SAM:
Gloria could die.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.667
She's persistently
hypotensive,

06:53.709 --> 06:55.166
she could be rejecting
the donor heart.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.667
It could be something else.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.458
That is a chance that
I don't think we should take.

06:59.709 --> 07:01.291
Sam's right.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.041
You gonna eat that
or frame it?

07:10.083 --> 07:12.917
It's a little thing called
attention to detail, my friend.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.083
Oh, Violet, hello. Look.
Hey.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.125
Hi.
Hello.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.041
VIOLET:
I'm sorry. I just need

07:24.083 --> 07:26.166
to get that juice.
Whoops. Heh, heh.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.250
Kind of in a rush.
Okay.

07:29.291 --> 07:31.750
All right. See you.
Uh-huh.

07:31.792 --> 07:34.583
That wasn't awkward at all.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.792
( sighs )

07:42.208 --> 07:43.750
CHARLOTTE:
You got it.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.291
Come on, Dad.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.667
Charlotte throws harder
than you do.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.166
Come on.
Less chatty, more throwy.

07:49.208 --> 07:52.166
( thunder rumbling )

07:52.208 --> 07:53.917
You know what?
I think it's gonna rain again.

07:53.959 --> 07:55.166
I think we should go.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.041
We're not scared
of a little rain, are we?

07:57.083 --> 08:00.041
It's more the threat
of pneumonia and lightning.

08:00.083 --> 08:03.041
Mas, I think you might be right.
Your dad might be a wuss.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.583
Go long.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.625
Mom, did you see that?

08:19.250 --> 08:21.959
You all right?
Would you be?

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Mom, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

08:27.208 --> 08:28.709
I'm not okay, honey.

08:28.750 --> 08:33.083
I'm sick. And I'm sure
you've noticed that.

08:33.125 --> 08:37.000
And I should have talked to you
about it before because

08:38.542 --> 08:39.709
I'm really sick.

08:39.750 --> 08:40.959
What do you mean?

08:42.125 --> 08:44.542
What's wrong with you?

08:44.583 --> 08:46.792
( tense theme playing )

08:46.834 --> 08:49.000
There's a tumor in her brain,
Mason.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.834
Mom,

08:54.875 --> 08:57.083
you're not gonna die,
are you?

09:02.291 --> 09:04.625
I hope not.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.333
( Erica sobbing )

09:06.375 --> 09:09.208
I really, really hope not.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.709
How long have you been sick?

09:15.291 --> 09:17.041
A long time.

09:17.083 --> 09:19.500
Why didn't you tell me?

09:19.542 --> 09:21.750
Why didn't you tell me
you might die?

09:23.083 --> 09:25.041
Mason. Mason.

09:25.083 --> 09:26.417
We're doing everything
that we can.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.041
She should have told me.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.959
Mason.
Here, I'll go. I'll go.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.208
( knocks )

09:42.500 --> 09:45.041
Hey. What were
you doing before?

09:45.083 --> 09:46.166
What do you mean?

09:46.208 --> 09:48.166
With Corinne.
You were being patronizing.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.542
And a little pessimistic.
No, Sam, I was being realistic.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.125
Corinne's behavior felt--

09:53.166 --> 09:56.083
Her speech was pressured,
she was highly energized.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.458
Her thoughts were expansive.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.041
That's Corinne.
It's also hypomania.

10:00.083 --> 10:03.041
All right, so...

10:03.083 --> 10:04.417
So she's a bit manic.

10:04.458 --> 10:07.875
Which could easily precede
full-blown mania and--

10:07.917 --> 10:10.125
That's a freight train.
At least she's not depressed.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.542
If my gut is right,
that'll happen later.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.041
What?
I'm not prepared

10:13.083 --> 10:14.834
to confirm a diagnosis, Sam.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.333
But it's very clear to me
that Corinne is sick.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.959
Probably since
she was a teenager.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.458
And the last two decades
have been a spiral of descent.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.041
I didn't hear her say that.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.375
I'm trained to listen to
what isn't said.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.792
My sister being happy
isn't a disease, Sheldon.

10:28.834 --> 10:31.291
It-- Look,
when Corinne left,

10:31.333 --> 10:33.041
even when it was bad,

10:33.083 --> 10:37.500
she was in my blood,
she was a huge part of my life.

10:37.542 --> 10:40.917
And when she walked out
that door,

10:40.959 --> 10:43.291
a part of me died
and I buried it,

10:43.333 --> 10:46.041
along with
all my memories of her.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.750
But now...

10:49.125 --> 10:52.709
I don't know.
I think that she is back.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.166
My sister is back.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.917
Well, Dr. Bennett thinks
you should have a C-section now.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.166
It'll put the least amount
of strain on your heart.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.041
It's too soon for the baby.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.834
Do you really think
delivering at 30 weeks is ideal?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.125
Look, you're not wrong.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.166
It will put your baby at risk
for developmental problems.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.417
But waiting
might not be an option.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.041
We've been through
so much to--

11:15.083 --> 11:17.041
To give up now
and just hope

11:17.083 --> 11:18.750
that our premature baby
survives--

11:18.792 --> 11:20.166
GLORIA:
We were wrong to deceive you,

11:20.208 --> 11:22.208
but no matter
what Dr. Bennett says,

11:22.250 --> 11:24.291
we won't do a C-section.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.500
Not now.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.333
( tense theme playing )

11:30.083 --> 11:32.208
VIOLET:
Hey. Thanks.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.875
Okay, remember I was telling you
about that sex I was having?

11:34.917 --> 11:36.875
That unattached, X-rated,
filthy, hot--

11:36.917 --> 11:38.208
Yes, I remember.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.166
I think
I may have screwed it up.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.875
Scott said he wants more.

11:41.917 --> 11:43.542
What did you say?
Nothing.

11:43.583 --> 11:46.667
What did he say?
I just rolled on top of him

11:46.709 --> 11:48.375
and shut him up.

11:48.417 --> 11:49.667
( both chuckle )

11:49.709 --> 11:50.792
Interesting strategy.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.875
I just--
I don't know what I want.

11:52.917 --> 11:54.041
Yeah, join the club.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.250
I slept with Sam.
What?

11:56.291 --> 11:58.625
I was all jazzed up
about saving that baby

11:58.667 --> 12:00.208
and he was all spun out
about Corinne.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.417
One thing led to another...

12:01.458 --> 12:02.458
Are you guys
getting back together?

12:02.500 --> 12:03.917
No.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.250
Because you wanna
throw yourself at Jake again?

12:05.291 --> 12:06.375
No, no, definitely not.

12:06.417 --> 12:08.041
All I get from that guy
is frostbite.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.667
Ahem. What about--?

12:09.709 --> 12:11.583
You know,
what about you and Pete?

12:11.625 --> 12:14.667
Ah... When I think about going
back into that situation, I--

12:14.709 --> 12:17.041
No, he hasn't changed.
Nothing's changed, so no.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.375
And as for Scott,

12:18.417 --> 12:20.625
look, look, I am a mother,
I have a full-time job.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.041
I have no business getting
into a real relationship.

12:23.083 --> 12:27.041
Do you like him? I mean,
apart from the filthy, hot sex?

12:27.083 --> 12:29.709
He's good. He's kind.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.458
He rubs my feet
when we watch TV.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.875
There's nothing wrong
with having fun.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.041
If that's what
feels right for you,

12:34.083 --> 12:36.458
then don't change a thing.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.041
CORINNE:
Chocolate malted.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.083
And a coffee too please.
Regular.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.667
Mmm.

12:45.709 --> 12:47.250
SAM:
Thank you. Keep the change.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.750
It's Mom's favorite.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.542
She's all right,
you know. Mom.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.667
I was afraid to ask.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.041
It's been so long,
I thought maybe--

12:58.083 --> 13:00.625
No, no, no, she's fine.
She's healthy, retired.

13:00.667 --> 13:03.709
She's got a companion
named James.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.083
( chuckles )

13:05.125 --> 13:08.458
Our mother is getting--
No, no, no. They just--

13:08.500 --> 13:11.750
They go out to dinners,
he fixes stuff around the house.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.041
Ha, ha! Sure, he does.
Ugh.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.959
Come on. That's nasty.

13:20.542 --> 13:23.583
Did she ever talk about me?

13:25.166 --> 13:28.041
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

13:28.083 --> 13:30.083
In the beginning.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.041
But, you know,
then it got tough for her,

13:32.083 --> 13:34.291
more than she could take.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.041
After a while--
She forgot about me.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.500
No. You were always there.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.291
For both of us.

13:42.333 --> 13:43.333
We should call her.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.125
I can't.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.000
Not yet. I mean, you know,

13:49.041 --> 13:53.000
this has already been a lot,
you know. I'm not ready, okay?

13:53.041 --> 13:55.041
Okay. All right.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.083
( calliope music playing
over speakers )

13:57.125 --> 13:59.041
Mm.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.667
Oh, no.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.041
( laughs )

14:02.083 --> 14:03.291
No, I still haven't
Please.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.041
gotten over the PTSD

14:05.083 --> 14:06.208
from the last time
you T-boned me.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.709
No, it's been forever.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.500
I'm a grown--
Let it go. Come on.

14:09.542 --> 14:11.041
Come with me right now.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.750
( Corinne laughing )

14:14.041 --> 14:15.959
You're going.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.458
( stopwatch ticking )

14:19.500 --> 14:20.875
Done.
Done.

14:20.917 --> 14:22.041
Ninety-two seconds.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.125
Damn it.
Son of a bitch.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.041
You did it five times straight
in under 90.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.041
We don't practice
until you can do it right.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.417
You practice
until you can't do it wrong.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.166
Okay. Go again.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.000
CHARLOTTE:
How's Erica?

14:39.041 --> 14:41.250
Sleeping or trying to.

14:41.291 --> 14:42.458
I don't know
how you'd fall asleep

14:42.500 --> 14:44.458
the night before you...

14:46.250 --> 14:48.500
I did this wrong.
I just-- I did it

14:50.000 --> 14:51.875
all wrong.
How so?

14:51.917 --> 14:53.667
Dragging Erica up here

14:53.709 --> 14:55.083
for some Hail Mary surgery

14:55.125 --> 14:56.417
that our friends
are gonna perform.

14:56.458 --> 14:58.041
They don't even know
if they can pull off.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.291
All I can do is pace around,

15:00.333 --> 15:03.000
thinking through
every awful eventuality.

15:03.041 --> 15:05.041
And my son is trapped
in a front-row seat

15:05.083 --> 15:07.166
for whatever happens, and you?
You didn't ask for any of it

15:07.208 --> 15:09.166
and you're trapped
in the middle of a horror show.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.041
Coop, breathe.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.875
No, I can't breathe, Charlotte.
That's--

15:12.917 --> 15:17.875
I can't breathe because I feel
like I screwed everything up,

15:17.917 --> 15:19.250
in the worst possible way.

15:19.291 --> 15:21.041
You didn't screw it up.

15:21.083 --> 15:24.000
You did the best you could.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.041
( pats chair )

15:28.083 --> 15:30.000
( tense theme playing )

15:36.250 --> 15:37.542
Tell me it's gonna be okay.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.709
Coop.
I'm not asking for a fairy tale.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.542
I'm just saying,
no matter what happens,

15:41.583 --> 15:42.709
it's gonna be okay.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.125
With worst case
and she dies,

15:44.166 --> 15:45.291
I mean, it's gonna be okay.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.917
Like we can do this,
we can raise this kid,

15:46.959 --> 15:48.583
you can be a mother.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.500
Just say it's gonna be okay.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.291
Okay.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.959
It's gonna be okay.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.709
COOPER:
So they're gonna be coming

16:17.750 --> 16:20.333
to take you to the OR
in a couple minutes and, uh...

16:20.375 --> 16:21.917
How you feeling?

16:21.959 --> 16:23.166
Okay.

16:23.208 --> 16:26.750
But they keep it
a little cold in here,

16:26.792 --> 16:28.834
don't you think, baby?

16:31.500 --> 16:33.917
COOPER:
Mason, please don't be mad
at your mom right now.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.125
No, he gets to be mad.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.959
Mason, look at me.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.291
You get to be mad.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.083
You get to have
all of your feelings.

16:43.125 --> 16:48.000
As long as you know, you have
to know, that I love you.

16:49.417 --> 16:50.834
Come here.

16:59.792 --> 17:03.166
I love you more than anything
in this whole stupid world. Heh.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.875
And I always will,
from wherever I am.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.458
Even if you're mad at me.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.041
You know that, don't you?

17:11.083 --> 17:13.083
( tender theme playing )

17:16.500 --> 17:19.250
Now, I need you
to go with your dad.

17:20.625 --> 17:23.625
Because I have to talk
to Charlotte for a second, okay?

17:23.667 --> 17:27.000
You can eat as much junk food
as you want today.

17:30.875 --> 17:31.875
It's okay.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.083
( sobs )

17:43.458 --> 17:45.041
What can I do for you?

17:45.083 --> 17:46.917
Teach him
how to drive a stick.

17:46.959 --> 17:48.709
Before you ever let him drive
an automatic,

17:48.750 --> 17:50.083
teach him
how to drive a stick

17:50.125 --> 17:52.250
so then he'll never
be stranded, okay?

17:52.291 --> 17:53.875
Okay.
Don't push him too hard

17:53.917 --> 17:55.250
on his grades.
He's smart like Cooper,

17:55.291 --> 17:58.000
but he's too hard
on himself,

17:58.041 --> 17:59.333
so don't add to that, okay?

18:00.500 --> 18:03.083
Okay.
And talk about me.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.083
You'll be his mom, but--
No.

18:06.125 --> 18:07.834
You will always be his mama.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.083
Whatever happens.

18:10.125 --> 18:13.041
Always.
He needs a living mom.

18:14.375 --> 18:17.125
He'll need you.
You get that?

18:17.166 --> 18:19.750
Cooper's not enough.

18:19.792 --> 18:22.500
He'll need you.

18:22.542 --> 18:25.917
They're doing
the surgery today?

18:25.959 --> 18:28.041
Okay. Well, yeah.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.041
Call or text or do something

18:30.083 --> 18:31.667
as soon as you know
anything, okay?

18:31.709 --> 18:34.542
All right. Love to everyone.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.500
Wow, that was fast.

18:36.542 --> 18:39.041
How are Charlotte and Cooper
holding up?

18:39.083 --> 18:40.208
Trying.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.250
Oh, hey, do you have
plans tonight?

18:43.291 --> 18:45.875
Do I have plans tonight?

18:45.917 --> 18:49.083
Yeah. I was wondering if
I could come by and see Lucas.

18:51.625 --> 18:52.917
If you're busy, then I'll--

18:52.959 --> 18:55.333
No, no, no. That's fine.
That's fine. Yes.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.291
( sighs )

19:04.208 --> 19:06.083
Hey. Do you have a second?

19:06.125 --> 19:10.000
I'm kind of busy right now.

19:17.041 --> 19:21.041
I'm sorry that
I didn't back you up with Sam.

19:21.083 --> 19:24.041
Well, no surprise there,
right?

19:24.083 --> 19:26.041
Look, you know what--

19:26.083 --> 19:28.625
What happened with Sam
was a one-time thing.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.625
And I am quite capable

19:30.667 --> 19:32.041
of separating
my personal feelings

19:32.083 --> 19:33.417
from my professional
opinions.

19:33.458 --> 19:35.208
Gloria fought the odds
to become a mother.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.417
You know, maybe unwisely,

19:36.458 --> 19:38.041
but she's earned the right

19:38.083 --> 19:40.333
to put the life of her baby
ahead of her own.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.208
No matter what we think,
she has that right.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.917
But Sam said--
Sam isn't her IVF specialist.

19:44.959 --> 19:46.208
All right?
And neither are you.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.208
Anything else?

19:52.875 --> 19:54.875
( tense theme playing )

20:01.041 --> 20:02.417
( sighs )

20:09.083 --> 20:11.041
DEREK:
You can do this.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.458
AMELIA:
There's no margin for error.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.041
There's no margin
for self-doubt.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.583
You think I don't
know that?

20:18.917 --> 20:20.709
I'll see you
in the OR.

20:25.834 --> 20:27.917
The last time I operated
on a friend, I was out of it.

20:27.959 --> 20:30.417
It's a miracle
nothing went wrong.

20:30.458 --> 20:33.291
I mean, what if my karmic
payback is now and Erica dies?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.709
I know you're scared.
That's good.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.875
Well, how is that different
from having self-doubt?

20:37.917 --> 20:40.041
You don't doubt your skills
as a surgeon.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.000
I wouldn't let you
scrub in if you did.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.583
I don't--
I don't see the difference--

20:43.625 --> 20:45.709
After Dad died,

20:45.750 --> 20:47.041
any time
there was a loud noise,

20:47.083 --> 20:49.500
like a gunshot,
you'd jump out of your skin.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.875
You got ahold
of these firecrackers.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.041
I found you in the yard
and you were setting them off

20:56.083 --> 20:59.709
one at a time
until you didn't jump anymore.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.041
When you're scared,
you fight.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.500
You face your fear
and you fight.

21:03.542 --> 21:04.500
And you fight to win.

21:04.542 --> 21:05.709
Your fight is much stronger

21:05.750 --> 21:07.959
than any karmic payback.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.333
You got this, Amy.

21:11.375 --> 21:12.750
We got this.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.750
Hey.
Whoa.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.208
I thought we'd have
stir-fry tonight.

21:20.250 --> 21:22.250
This is adventurous.

21:22.291 --> 21:23.667
When did you learn
how to cook?

21:23.709 --> 21:25.417
Couple years ago.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.834
There's this dive on Pico
in Venice.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.417
The chef took pity on me.

21:29.458 --> 21:32.959
Let me watch in the kitchen
and eat the leftovers.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.041
Wait. A couple years ago?
That-- You must mean...

21:37.083 --> 21:38.959
Wait, how--?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.291
How long you been here
in L.A.?

21:41.333 --> 21:43.083
It's, um...

21:43.125 --> 21:45.750
It's complicated.
Corinne.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.208
How long you been here?

21:50.750 --> 21:52.709
You know, there's a shelter
on Santa Monica.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.083
I'm just gonna go--
Wait. Don't-- Don't--

21:54.125 --> 21:57.041
Don't avoid me.
Don't run away.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.000
Just answer my question.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.000
Five-- Five-- Five years.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.709
( tense theme playing )

22:09.750 --> 22:12.041
Do you have any idea

22:12.083 --> 22:13.625
what it's been like for me?

22:13.667 --> 22:16.417
For Mom? We--

22:16.458 --> 22:19.583
We thought you were dead.

22:19.625 --> 22:20.625
Do you get that?

22:22.208 --> 22:25.333
Hey! We thought
you were dead!

22:25.375 --> 22:27.583
After ten years,
we had a funeral for you.

22:27.625 --> 22:29.750
Your name
was on a headstone.

22:29.792 --> 22:31.583
Sam, I--
Don't. Stop.

22:31.625 --> 22:34.750
Because I had to watch
our mother broken.

22:34.792 --> 22:37.041
She was destroyed.

22:37.083 --> 22:40.041
And me? How could you
do that to me?

22:40.083 --> 22:41.834
To us?

22:42.834 --> 22:45.041
It's not about you.
How could it be?

22:45.083 --> 22:47.667
It's always been about you!

22:49.625 --> 22:51.458
What happened
to my baby sister?

22:52.834 --> 22:55.041
You don't wanna know.

22:58.291 --> 23:00.667
You're right,
I don't wanna know.

23:01.792 --> 23:03.041
All this was so much easier

23:03.083 --> 23:06.667
when we thought
you were dead.

23:06.709 --> 23:09.083
( tense theme playing )

23:17.709 --> 23:20.291
Last night, I was

23:20.333 --> 23:23.667
laying down
in Sam's guest room

23:23.709 --> 23:26.583
and I was fantasizing
about an earthquake.

23:26.625 --> 23:30.417
Not one that would hurt
anyone else.

23:30.458 --> 23:34.417
Just enough to make
the piece of roof above my head

23:34.458 --> 23:36.250
fall and crack
my skull open.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.959
To what end?

23:39.959 --> 23:41.041
I'm not sure.

23:41.083 --> 23:45.250
I don't know if I just wanted
the pain to stop

23:45.291 --> 23:50.417
or if I wished I could finally
feel something real.

23:50.458 --> 23:51.834
( scoffs )

23:51.875 --> 23:52.917
But then again, I don't--

23:52.959 --> 23:54.333
I don't even know
what's real.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.208
All of it is.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.041
Everything you feel.

23:58.083 --> 24:02.500
So I am a waste of skin.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.041
Corinne.
For what I did to Sam,

24:05.083 --> 24:07.000
to my mother,

24:07.041 --> 24:10.041
I should be taken out
back and shot.

24:10.083 --> 24:11.709
This is not your fault.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.041
You're suffering
from a disorder.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.458
It's called--
Does it matter what it's called?

24:15.500 --> 24:17.041
Because whatever
you think it is,

24:17.083 --> 24:18.083
there's a drug for it.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.041
And I'm pretty sure
I've taken it before

24:20.083 --> 24:21.166
and it didn't work.

24:24.083 --> 24:25.667
What's happening with you,

24:25.709 --> 24:28.041
what's been happening
all these years,

24:28.083 --> 24:29.083
is bigger than you.

24:29.125 --> 24:33.000
And every day a battle
is fought in your mind.

24:33.041 --> 24:34.750
And with
repeated misdiagnoses,

24:34.792 --> 24:36.041
and the lack
of proper treatment,

24:36.083 --> 24:39.250
and the instability
of your life,

24:39.291 --> 24:40.917
all those things
have made it worse.

24:40.959 --> 24:45.000
You're suffering
from bipolar disorder.

24:46.166 --> 24:49.041
And right now,
you feel like you can't go on,

24:49.083 --> 24:52.667
but I'm telling you--
I'm tired, Dr. Wallace.

24:52.709 --> 24:54.750
I'm so tired.

24:57.542 --> 25:01.000
Why'd this happen to me?
I was so smart.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.792
I got A's in everything.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.083
I could do everything.

25:05.125 --> 25:09.750
My junior year in high school,
everyone wanted to be me.

25:09.792 --> 25:14.375
And then one day,
it was all gone.

25:14.417 --> 25:17.250
I can only imagine
how hard that would be.

25:18.792 --> 25:21.083
But the Corinne of yesterday

25:21.125 --> 25:23.500
did a load of laundry,
and organized some books

25:23.542 --> 25:25.542
and went on a run.

25:25.583 --> 25:29.041
And if you can
endure bottoms,

25:29.083 --> 25:31.041
there will be tops
that will allow you

25:31.083 --> 25:33.041
to shine and to thrive.

25:33.083 --> 25:36.792
And with the proper medications,
and diet and sleep,

25:36.834 --> 25:41.959
we can try to turn down
the intensity of the swings

25:42.000 --> 25:44.041
and help you achieve
your own normalcy.

25:44.083 --> 25:47.750
But you have to be patient

25:47.792 --> 25:50.041
and you have to
let me help you.

It's your mama's brain.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.583
And that is the tumor
growing inside it.

27:23.625 --> 27:26.709
So the doctors have to cut into
her head to get it out?

27:26.750 --> 27:27.792

Mm-hm.

27:27.834 --> 27:30.000
So how are they gonna do it?

27:30.041 --> 27:32.875
Well, first they'll cut out
a section of her skull

27:32.917 --> 27:36.041
and dissect the brain
so that they can see the tumor.

27:36.083 --> 27:38.083
And they'll separate the tumor
from surrounding tissue

27:38.125 --> 27:39.250

27:39.291 --> 27:41.041
If everything

they'll close her up.

There are risks

Your mom could
get a blood clot

27:53.041 --> 27:55.041

27:55.083 --> 27:58.709
It might affect her speech,
her vision, her memory.

She might have a seizure
or a stroke.

28:01.959 --> 28:04.000
Or she could die
from the operation.

Can I talk to you
for a minute?

Look, I just wanted
to apologize for this morning.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.875
I didn't mean to yell.
Yes, you did.

29:55.917 --> 29:58.709
Because you are
the selfish one.

29:58.750 --> 30:02.041
For the last 20 years,
everything in my head,

30:02.083 --> 30:05.250
it's been big and bold.

30:05.291 --> 30:09.041
No whispers, just screams.

30:09.083 --> 30:10.250
And I tried to deal with it.

30:10.291 --> 30:14.083
You know,
I felt responsible.

30:14.125 --> 30:16.291
I thought it was me.

30:16.333 --> 30:19.000
But you know what, Sam?
I'm sick.

30:19.041 --> 30:21.667
I'm the one
with bipolar disorder.

30:21.709 --> 30:23.875

all you want

30:23.917 --> 30:28.166

and how worried Mom was.

30:28.208 --> 30:31.375
And I feel bad about that,
I really do.

30:31.417 --> 30:35.291
But I was living it.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.875
And I protected you
from the worst of it.

30:40.542 --> 30:44.333
While you were in med school,
I did my first stint in jail.

30:44.375 --> 30:49.542
And while you were off
being a big, fancy doctor,

30:49.583 --> 30:51.709
I was eating garbage,

30:51.750 --> 30:53.750
so I could have enough money
for drugs

30:53.792 --> 30:57.208
because that was the only way
to escape the pain.

30:57.250 --> 31:02.917
And while you were having
a family and living in Malibu,

31:02.959 --> 31:05.250
I was selling my body

31:05.291 --> 31:08.000
just to survive.

31:09.667 --> 31:13.208
So you missed me.

31:14.208 --> 31:16.000
Poor you.

31:18.041 --> 31:20.834
This isn't your journey,
it's mine.

It is my pathetic life.

31:26.917 --> 31:29.041
And you might hate me.

31:29.083 --> 31:32.041
But guess what, Sam,
I hate me more.

31:32.083 --> 31:36.417
And I can tell you
to go to hell.

31:36.458 --> 31:40.667
But having lived there
the past 20 years,

31:41.834 --> 31:44.625

you can't handle it.

We need to do
an endocardial biopsy.

32:11.083 --> 32:12.709
Figure out what's going on.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.041
Is the procedure
safe for the baby?

32:14.083 --> 32:16.667
The baby will be exposed
to radiation during the x-ray.

32:16.709 --> 32:18.667
The procedure could cause
precipitous labor.

32:18.709 --> 32:21.041
GLORIA:
No. I'm not doing it.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.125
Gloria, listen to me.
She said no, Sam.

32:23.166 --> 32:25.500
She can't breathe. She'll die
if we don't do something.

32:25.542 --> 32:27.041
Give her another dose
of diuretics.

32:27.083 --> 32:28.875
She's maxed out.
Put her on a pump.

32:28.917 --> 32:30.917
Jake, she is a year and a half
post-transplant.

32:30.959 --> 32:32.041
She's been doing fine.

32:32.083 --> 32:33.875
I'm not just gonna
throw darts at a board.

32:33.917 --> 32:36.041
I have to figure out why
she's rejecting her heart now.

32:36.083 --> 32:37.000
GLORIA:
I know.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.500
I'm sorry.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.875
But I stopped taking
my immunosuppressant drugs

32:42.917 --> 32:44.125
when I got pregnant.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.333
Why would you do that?

32:46.375 --> 32:47.917
They could hurt the baby.

32:47.959 --> 32:49.709
BRAD:
You shouldn't have done that.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.041
Shouldn't have done
that on your own.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.083
Her water broke.

32:52.125 --> 32:54.542
We gotta get her
into Labor and Delivery now.

32:54.583 --> 32:55.792
JAKE:
Move back there.

32:57.166 --> 32:58.667
ADDISON:
Baby's coming too fast.

32:58.709 --> 33:00.041
Gloria,
I need you to stop pushing.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.041
I can't.
Try to slow your breathing.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.041
It hurts.

33:03.083 --> 33:05.041
JAKE:
Gloria. You breathe with me.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.041
Breathe with me.

33:06.083 --> 33:07.041
SAM:
Her pressure's dropping.

33:07.083 --> 33:08.041
Hurry up, Addison.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.458
( monitor beeping )

33:09.500 --> 33:11.166
ADDISON: What's going on?
SAM: I'm losing her pulse.

33:11.208 --> 33:12.917
Get ready to bag her.
JAKE: I'm on it.

33:12.959 --> 33:15.166
SAM:
Get that baby out of there.

33:15.208 --> 33:16.375
ADDISON:
Head's out.

33:16.417 --> 33:17.709
SAM:
Anesthesia.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.375
Thoracotomy tray.

33:19.417 --> 33:20.709
You're gonna crack open
her chest?

33:20.750 --> 33:21.709
I have no choice.

33:21.750 --> 33:22.917
Towel and cord clamp.

33:22.959 --> 33:23.917
JAKE:
What do you need?

33:23.959 --> 33:24.917
SAM:
Sternal saw.

33:24.959 --> 33:25.917
JAKE:
It's coming.

33:25.959 --> 33:29.750
( upbeat pop music playing )

33:35.667 --> 33:36.875
SAM:
All right. Spreader.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.041
Addison, we're running
out of time.

33:40.083 --> 33:41.375
ADDISON:
Got her. Scissors.

33:41.417 --> 33:43.583
( baby crying )

33:43.625 --> 33:44.583
JAKE:
I can crank her open.

33:44.625 --> 33:46.083
SAM:
Do it.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.291
( monitor beeping )

33:47.333 --> 33:49.125
Damn it.
ADDISON: What's going on?

33:49.166 --> 33:51.041
SAM:
Dissected her aorta.
I need a cross-clamp.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.750
Call Perfusion for bypass.

33:52.792 --> 33:53.750
JAKE:
She's in fib.

33:53.792 --> 33:54.834
ADDISON:
We're losing her.

33:54.875 --> 33:56.041
SAM:
Almost there.

33:56.083 --> 33:57.542
Just give me a second.

33:57.583 --> 33:59.542
DEREK:
Erica.

33:59.583 --> 34:01.041
Erica.

34:01.083 --> 34:03.792
It's Dr. Shepherd.
Can you hear me?

34:03.834 --> 34:06.000
Mm. Hurts.

34:06.041 --> 34:07.750
We'll get you something
for the pain.

34:07.792 --> 34:09.583
Can you wiggle
your toes for me?

34:10.625 --> 34:13.750
And your fingers?
Both hands?

34:13.792 --> 34:15.792
Good. All right.

34:16.917 --> 34:19.250
We got the whole tumor.
All of it.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.667
I lived? I'm alive?

34:22.709 --> 34:25.083
If this is heaven, sister,
I want my money back.

34:25.125 --> 34:26.625
( Erica chuckles )

34:26.667 --> 34:28.834
Ow. Hurt.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.291
Pain medicine will kick in
in a second.

34:35.709 --> 34:38.709
Erica, Mason's looking
through the window.

34:39.917 --> 34:41.000
No. Don't raise your head.

34:42.083 --> 34:45.083
Just wave. You can do it.

34:45.125 --> 34:48.000
Lift your hand. Wave.

35:00.417 --> 35:01.792
Perfect.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.291
I'm alive.

35:13.083 --> 35:15.041
( tender rock music playing )

35:15.083 --> 35:16.125
AMELIA:
We did that.

35:16.166 --> 35:18.417
We did that.
We gotta publish.

35:18.458 --> 35:19.917
Oh, hell, yeah, we do.

35:19.959 --> 35:21.125
If you ever think
about doing drugs again--

35:21.166 --> 35:23.041
Remember this?
I was gonna say call me.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.458
I'll fly down to Los Angeles
and knock some sense into you.

35:25.500 --> 35:28.125
But, okay, remember this.
That doesn't work.

35:28.166 --> 35:30.041
Yeah, you can totally
kick my ass.

35:30.083 --> 35:31.250
Done.

35:31.291 --> 35:33.000
( Amelia chuckles )

35:34.583 --> 35:35.583
I love you.

35:38.166 --> 35:40.333
She's so small,

35:40.375 --> 35:43.041
but she's perfect.

35:43.083 --> 35:46.709
Got ten little fingers
and ten little toes.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.792
And her face looks

35:48.834 --> 35:51.834
just like you did
when you were younger.

35:53.959 --> 35:56.041
It's not a boy though,

35:56.083 --> 35:59.375
so I guess
we can't use the name Thomas.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.959
We never really talked
about girls' names.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.291
We should've talked
about girls' names.

36:07.333 --> 36:10.750
She's gonna need
something strong.

36:10.792 --> 36:13.000
Like her mom.

36:15.083 --> 36:17.000
( Brad sighs )

36:20.959 --> 36:24.083
We should've talked about
girls' names.

36:24.125 --> 36:26.458
We should've.

36:40.291 --> 36:41.667
What are you thinking about?

36:41.709 --> 36:43.709
Nothing.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.709
Come on.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.291
Um...

36:51.208 --> 36:52.333
Well, I actually
was thinking

36:52.375 --> 36:53.333
about how bizarre
my life is.

36:53.375 --> 36:56.000
I live in a hotel.

36:56.041 --> 36:57.583
I...

36:57.625 --> 36:59.834
Uh...

36:59.875 --> 37:02.041
I'm having S-E-X
with a 29-year-old.

37:02.083 --> 37:06.166
And I had I-N-T-E-R-C-O-U-R-S-E
in an elevator.

37:06.208 --> 37:09.041
I know you did.
With an S-L-U-T.

37:09.083 --> 37:10.417
( Pete chuckles )

37:10.458 --> 37:14.583
Yeah. These bars,
these women, it's not--

37:14.625 --> 37:16.041
They're not...

37:19.917 --> 37:21.625
You ever think a year ago,
we'd be--

37:21.667 --> 37:24.375
Talking about having sex
with other people?

37:24.417 --> 37:26.542
No.

37:29.917 --> 37:32.750
Who are we?
I don't know.

37:41.542 --> 37:44.625
I love medicine!

37:44.667 --> 37:47.667
( both laughing )

37:47.709 --> 37:48.917
Seriously, I do.

37:48.959 --> 37:51.417
The whole medical field.
I'm in love with it.

37:51.458 --> 37:53.625
I would marry it if I wasn't
already married to you.

37:53.667 --> 37:56.083
Well, I'm glad
I got to you first.

37:56.125 --> 37:57.959
Thank you.

38:00.583 --> 38:02.417
And thank you.

38:03.917 --> 38:05.834
I mean, you did not
sign up for this.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.000
I love him.

38:08.083 --> 38:09.458
Mason.

38:10.583 --> 38:12.041
I didn't think I could.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.458
I mean, I didn't think
I would, but...

38:17.083 --> 38:19.000
When I thought
his mama might die...

38:21.792 --> 38:23.542
I love him.

38:26.333 --> 38:28.333
And I think it's--

38:30.542 --> 38:32.792
I think it's because
I love you so damn much.

38:34.625 --> 38:36.166
I love you, Cooper.

38:36.208 --> 38:38.917
So damn much.
I love you.

38:47.083 --> 38:49.333
I like you.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.333
You make me feel...

38:53.375 --> 38:57.417
You have reminded me
that I can laugh

38:57.458 --> 39:00.000
and smile

39:00.041 --> 39:02.041
and be fun

39:02.083 --> 39:05.583
and not think about anything
but being close to you.

39:05.625 --> 39:07.875
And that is

39:09.250 --> 39:10.792
so, so nice.

39:13.125 --> 39:15.041
I don't want more.

39:15.083 --> 39:17.041
I don't have more.

39:18.417 --> 39:22.000
So it's either incredible,

39:22.959 --> 39:24.792
unattached,

39:25.917 --> 39:30.417
mind-numbing sex or nothing.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.166
I'll take it.

39:51.709 --> 39:52.917
Tell me something.

39:54.250 --> 39:57.041
Am I reading too much into

39:57.083 --> 39:58.166
all of this?

39:58.208 --> 40:00.583
Into...?
You and me.

40:00.625 --> 40:04.041
The grocery store,
Fiji, Palm Springs.

40:04.083 --> 40:07.041
Am I reading too much
into that?

40:07.083 --> 40:10.500
Was it purely physical

40:12.083 --> 40:13.625
or is it--?

40:13.667 --> 40:15.458
Is there something
emotional here?

40:17.291 --> 40:19.583
For me?
Yeah.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.333
For you.

40:23.208 --> 40:25.625
It's not just physical.

40:30.083 --> 40:31.709
Okay.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.792
I figured...

41:02.166 --> 41:04.291
I thought that
you left because of me.

41:05.291 --> 41:07.959
That time when I told Mom

41:08.000 --> 41:11.959
that I didn't want a party
for my birthday

41:13.083 --> 41:15.458
because I didn't want you
to ruin it

41:15.500 --> 41:18.291
just like everything else.

41:18.333 --> 41:20.583
I turned around

41:20.625 --> 41:25.583
and you were standing there
and I know that you heard me.

41:27.125 --> 41:29.041
And a week later,
you were gone.

41:29.083 --> 41:31.792
I didn't leave because of you,
Sam.

41:31.834 --> 41:35.291
I left because I was sick.

41:35.333 --> 41:38.125
You didn't cause this.

41:38.166 --> 41:41.000
You didn't make this happen.

41:55.125 --> 41:57.709
And you'd think that that would
be a depressing thought.

41:57.750 --> 42:00.208
That there's no end
to all of the...

42:00.250 --> 42:02.291
I don't know.
That it doesn't get easier,

42:02.333 --> 42:03.542
that it just gets different.

42:03.583 --> 42:05.291
But it's not. It is not.

42:05.333 --> 42:09.041
It's the opposite of depressing.
There's a relief in it.

42:09.083 --> 42:11.917
Life is complex. There's nothing
simple or easy about it.

42:11.959 --> 42:15.458
So I can stop waiting
for it to--

42:15.500 --> 42:18.125
I can stop waiting.

42:18.166 --> 42:21.125
And I can just

42:21.166 --> 42:22.834
live.

42:29.917 --> 42:31.917
( mellow theme playing )
