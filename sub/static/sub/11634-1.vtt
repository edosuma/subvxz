Hey, hey!

01:40.176 --> 01:42.427
C'mon, pay attention.

01:42.428 --> 01:44.930
Look, you're just a machine,
right?

01:44.931 --> 01:48.267
You got no soul.
You gotta do what I say.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.856
And remember, I know
where your off switch is.

02:03.115 --> 02:04.908
Ma'am,

02:04.909 --> 02:06.993
may I have a word with you?

02:06.994 --> 02:09.997
Ye...

02:11.415 --> 02:14.085
Why certainly, officer.
Is there a problem?

02:21.009 --> 02:22.927
Yes, there is.

Now, um, Deanewood is not
Chicago by any stretch,

07:14.218 --> 07:17.220
but we do have some
things they don't.

07:17.221 --> 07:20.015
Like Starbucks, for example.

07:21.016 --> 07:23.810
We have those in Chicago.

07:23.811 --> 07:27.146
Right, but, uh, what
I mean is, we don't.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.773
Have one.

07:28.774 --> 07:30.441
We do have Jack's Java, though,

07:30.442 --> 07:33.487
and I think you'll find
it's a far superior brew.

07:34.322 --> 07:37.200
Do you have a yoga studio?

07:38.075 --> 07:40.118
No. No, no yoga studio.

07:40.119 --> 07:43.162
But the women at
the seniors' centre

07:43.163 --> 07:45.249
do Tai Chi every
Wednesday at noon.

07:45.250 --> 07:48.544
You're a little young, but
I think I can get you in.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.673
Thanks, Uncle Paul.

07:54.342 --> 07:56.217
Yeah, about that...

07:56.218 --> 08:00.179
I don't think you need to
say the whole uncle part.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.017
It kinda makes me feel old.

08:16.405 --> 08:18.324
Aaron.

08:18.782 --> 08:21.285
I told you, you don't
need to do this.

08:21.286 --> 08:23.202
Of course I do,
Mr. Mayor.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.288
You're running
for re-election.

08:25.289 --> 08:27.999
Running unopposed for
the third time in a row.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.168
It's not necessary to
go through the trouble.

08:30.169 --> 08:32.419
It's no trouble.
I made these on my computer

08:32.421 --> 08:35.131
and, besides, you've got
the restaurant to run, too.

08:35.131 --> 08:37.091
Can't have the universe's
best cheeseburger suffer

08:37.092 --> 08:39.092
because your focus is split.

08:39.094 --> 08:41.431
Very well, then.
As you were.

08:44.265 --> 08:46.643
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

08:46.644 --> 08:48.811
Aaron, this is Isabel, my niece.

08:48.812 --> 08:50.271
Hi.

08:50.272 --> 08:53.317
Isabel's gonna be living
in Deanewood now forever.

08:55.110 --> 08:57.236
Well not forever necessarily.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.865
Just, you know,
for the time being.

09:00.324 --> 09:03.117
Isabel is studying
political science,

09:03.118 --> 09:05.287
so you guys have that in common

09:05.288 --> 09:07.372
because Aaron here is my
communications director.

09:07.373 --> 09:10.541
And by that, he means
that I actually own a computer,

09:10.542 --> 09:12.336
unlike him.

09:12.337 --> 09:14.921
All this hullabaloo about
the world wide interweb,

09:14.922 --> 09:17.882
it's just a passing fad.

09:17.883 --> 09:21.261
That's why I leave the
tweeting to the birds.

09:29.103 --> 09:31.146
I'm gonna get the bags in.

09:33.065 --> 09:35.066
Your uncle's a cool guy.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.072
I'm okay.

09:41.073 --> 09:43.867
In his own way.

09:44.535 --> 09:46.286
Yeah.

09:48.997 --> 09:51.666
So, um...

09:51.667 --> 09:54.462
what brings you to town?

09:56.338 --> 09:59.132
Oh, uh...

09:59.133 --> 10:01.300
I-I really don't want
to talk about that,

10:01.301 --> 10:03.344
if you don't mind.

10:03.345 --> 10:06.639
Yeah. I understand.
It's all right.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.599
But it was nice to meet you.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.521
Yeah, you too.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.201
So we're just
right in here.

10:32.249 --> 10:34.292
There's an IKEA in Brockton,

10:34.293 --> 10:37.837
so I went there last weekend
and picked up some things.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.964
Like a new bed.

10:39.965 --> 10:42.175
Yeah, yeah.

10:42.176 --> 10:44.093
And some other things.

10:44.094 --> 10:46.345
The girl at the store
was really helpful.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.890
She also told me to get
really expensive toilet paper,

10:48.891 --> 10:50.641
which I did. Really.
Try that stuff.

10:50.642 --> 10:53.563
It's like wiping your bum
with a baby rabbit.

10:54.938 --> 10:58.274
Not literally.
That would be cruel.

10:58.275 --> 11:01.694
You know what I mean.
It's, uh, soft.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.574
Yeah. I appreciate it.

11:06.451 --> 11:08.159
Listen,

11:08.160 --> 11:12.079
if it seems like I have
no idea what I'm doing,

11:12.080 --> 11:16.043
it's only because...
I have no idea what I'm doing.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.088
But I want you to feel
comfortable here.

11:20.964 --> 11:23.549
Your house is perfect.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.512
Your house. Our house.

11:27.304 --> 11:29.474
I'd like you to feel
at home here.

11:38.941 --> 11:41.275
Well, get yourself settled.

11:41.276 --> 11:42.652
I'll make some dinner

11:42.653 --> 11:45.363
and maybe we can go to
the restaurant tomorrow

11:45.364 --> 11:47.699
and see about getting
you a summer job.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.888
They say that a dog is
human's best friend.

12:10.889 --> 12:13.600
Thanks to our partnership
with Cyborganix,

12:13.601 --> 12:16.477
we have managed to create
a cybernetic dog

12:16.478 --> 12:20.439
that will not only become
human's best friend,

12:20.440 --> 12:23.902
but our military's best friend
as well.

12:25.362 --> 12:28.406
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

12:28.407 --> 12:32.994
the Artificial Robotronic Canine
Hyper Intelligence Experiment,

12:32.995 --> 12:35.664
or A.R.C.H.I.E. for short,

12:35.665 --> 12:37.874
a non-living,
intelligent machine

12:37.875 --> 12:39.959
that will save human lives.

12:46.551 --> 12:50.469
Danger, danger, danger,
danger, danger.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.951
You can't be serious.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.037
You're telling me
that the experiment

13:16.038 --> 13:18.247
that this company
has poured millions into,

13:18.248 --> 13:21.083
and that just also happens
to be my life's work,

13:21.084 --> 13:23.337
has been stolen
from under our noses!

13:24.212 --> 13:26.464
And the security cameras

13:26.465 --> 13:28.507
coincidentally happen
to malfunction. Ha!

13:28.508 --> 13:30.635
How is that even possible?

13:30.636 --> 13:32.261
Ms. Benton,

13:32.262 --> 13:34.597
I know you're behind
this little stunt

13:34.598 --> 13:37.308
because people like you,

13:37.309 --> 13:39.936
you think you're gonna
change the world.

13:39.937 --> 13:42.271
This is not some
cute little puppy

13:42.272 --> 13:44.190
you're saving from a kennel.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.025
This is a
multi-million dollar,

13:46.026 --> 13:50.112
potentially unstable
piece of military hardware.

13:50.113 --> 13:52.907
Do you have any idea
what could happen

13:52.908 --> 13:56.203
if this got into
the wrong hands?

14:02.209 --> 14:04.502
Welcome to Deanewood.

14:04.503 --> 14:06.714
I hope they have
some good food here.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.552
You got any fast
food experience.

14:13.553 --> 14:17.223
Only as a customer
once in a while.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.266
Well, it ain't rocket science.

14:19.267 --> 14:22.103
As long as you can count,
you'll be fine.

14:22.104 --> 14:25.022
Let me get you a uniform.
What colour do you want?

14:25.023 --> 14:27.651
What colours do you have?

14:27.652 --> 14:29.402
Blue.

14:29.403 --> 14:32.571
Well, I guess
I'll take that, then.

14:36.744 --> 14:38.327
Hello again.

14:38.328 --> 14:39.745
Oh, hi.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.706
He's putting you to
work already, huh?

14:41.707 --> 14:43.667
Yeah.

14:43.668 --> 14:46.711
Listen, I'm really
sorry about yesterday.

14:46.712 --> 14:49.171
I didn't mean to be rude.
I just...

14:49.172 --> 14:53.427
It's really no problem.
You know, I understand.

14:53.885 --> 14:55.929
Thanks.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.100
If you ever want
to hang out and talk...

15:01.101 --> 15:03.477
or, you know, not talk,

15:03.478 --> 15:06.273
you should let me know.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.027
Hey, Aaron.
Hey, Aaron.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.904
Are you lost?

15:13.905 --> 15:15.990
Um, no.

15:15.991 --> 15:19.036
Wait. Are you the new girl?

15:19.911 --> 15:21.705
I'm Isabel.

15:21.706 --> 15:23.831
Oh, I heard about you.

15:23.832 --> 15:26.333
My mom said that
your parents died

15:26.334 --> 15:28.711
and now you have to live
with your uncle.

15:28.712 --> 15:32.631
So I guess you're
like an orphan.

15:32.632 --> 15:37.011
Uh, yeah, yeah, I guess so.

15:37.012 --> 15:40.222
That's so super sad.

15:40.223 --> 15:43.686
Maybe we can all hang out later.

15:44.561 --> 15:47.104
We'll show you around.
Our town's a real trip.

15:47.105 --> 15:50.859
Yeah, yeah. We'll totally
show you around.

15:50.860 --> 15:52.777
It's a total trip.

15:52.778 --> 15:56.573
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
That sounds like fun.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.334
Welcome aboard.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.252
Yeah, about that.

16:10.253 --> 16:13.631
I don't know how great a
server I'm cut out to be,

16:13.632 --> 16:15.508
carrying trays and all.

16:15.509 --> 16:18.636
Balance and coordination
aren't exactly my strong suit.

16:18.637 --> 16:21.680
Tell me about it.
I'm as clumsy as a donkey.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.475
It's 'cause I got fat feet.

16:23.809 --> 16:26.602
Flat feet.

16:26.603 --> 16:29.648
It's also the reason
I could never join the circus.

16:32.317 --> 16:35.528
But I'm sorry, serving is a
requirement for all wait staff.

16:35.529 --> 16:38.906
Well, isn't there any
other job I could do?

16:38.907 --> 16:41.617
You could always take
a shift as mascot.

16:47.582 --> 16:49.500
Change in the back.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.594
The Princess of Darkness
is here to see you.

17:04.683 --> 17:06.393
Not again.

17:09.771 --> 17:11.815
Four chili dogs for table six.

17:11.816 --> 17:13.775
Two double cheeseburgers
for table nine.

17:13.776 --> 17:15.651
Two chocolate shakes
for table two.

17:17.194 --> 17:19.445
And a large onions rings
for table three.

17:19.446 --> 17:23.451
Best way to learn how to swim
is to jump in at the deep end.

17:26.704 --> 17:29.457
It's also a great way to drown.

17:40.969 --> 17:43.387
As you are aware,
Mogulburger has...

17:43.388 --> 17:46.390
297 locations
across the country.

17:46.391 --> 17:49.268
Yes. And your location would
make a welcome addition

17:49.269 --> 17:51.938
to our family of franchises.

17:51.939 --> 17:53.815
Veronica, for the
kazillionth time,

17:53.816 --> 17:55.859
I'm not selling.

17:55.860 --> 17:57.276
What is this really about?

17:57.277 --> 18:00.029
Is it because I never
asked you to prom?

18:00.030 --> 18:03.073
Prom! Don't be silly.

18:03.074 --> 18:05.701
I haven't thought
about that in years.

18:05.702 --> 18:08.245
This is a prime location

18:08.246 --> 18:11.917
and we are willing
to pay handsomely for it.

18:13.543 --> 18:15.377
I don't need to join

18:15.378 --> 18:17.630
the Mogulburger family
of franchises.

18:17.631 --> 18:20.967
As you can see, we're doing
very well here on our own.

18:23.553 --> 18:25.472
Oh!

18:29.684 --> 18:31.810
You klutz!

18:31.811 --> 18:33.812
Oh my god, I'm so sorry!

18:33.813 --> 18:35.856
Did you put her up to this?

18:35.857 --> 18:38.275
No, of course not.
It was an accident.

18:38.276 --> 18:40.194
We'll pay for your
dry cleaning bill.

18:40.195 --> 18:42.864
Oh, you will pay for
more than just that.

18:43.281 --> 18:44.991
Oh!

18:54.459 --> 18:57.628
I told you. It's a real trip
around here.

19:09.557 --> 19:11.184
It's gonna be okay.

19:14.063 --> 19:16.273
It's gonna be okay.

19:20.402 --> 19:22.403
It's gonna be...

19:25.532 --> 19:27.993
I just feel so alone.

19:28.952 --> 19:32.039
I know how you feel.
But you're not alone.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.292
Hi there.

19:36.293 --> 19:39.087
You're not gonna throw
that away, are you?

19:39.088 --> 19:42.589
I'll eat it if you're not
going to. I'm starved.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.967
Wow, this looks like
really high quality food,

19:44.968 --> 19:47.595
not like some of that
other junk you humans eat.

19:48.722 --> 19:51.182
My name is Archie.

19:52.017 --> 19:54.059
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but in polite society,

19:54.060 --> 19:55.979
when someone introduces
themselves to you,

19:55.980 --> 19:58.440
it's customary to
return the favour.

19:59.816 --> 20:01.108
You speak English?

20:01.109 --> 20:03.694
Okay, parlez-vous francais?

20:03.695 --> 20:05.154
Habla español?

20:05.155 --> 20:07.031
Sprechen sie Deutsche?

20:07.032 --> 20:09.283
You're-you're
a talking dog?

20:09.284 --> 20:11.243
I suppose that's an
accurate description,

20:11.244 --> 20:14.038
though I have many
other qualities as well.

20:14.039 --> 20:15.957
You still haven't
told me your name.

20:15.958 --> 20:17.959
I-I-Isabel.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.003
There we go.
Now we're getting somewhere.

20:20.004 --> 20:21.378
Nice to meet you, Isabel.

20:21.379 --> 20:24.590
Yeah, yeah, nice...
Nice to meet you.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.051
I'm talking to a dog.

20:27.052 --> 20:30.180
I must have finally
lost my mind.

20:31.765 --> 20:34.143
Hey, wait!

20:35.310 --> 20:38.063
Does that mean it's cool
if I eat your cheeseburger?

20:44.277 --> 20:47.488
It's just stress. That's all.

20:47.489 --> 20:50.033
Hallucinations
brought on by stress.

20:52.869 --> 20:54.370
Hello again.

20:54.371 --> 20:57.790
Listen, I think we got off
on the wrong paw back there.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.583
How did you get here so fast?

20:59.584 --> 21:01.877
I told you I had many
different abilities.

21:01.878 --> 21:03.629
Clearly.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.464
I didn't mean to freak you out.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.300
I'm new in town and I-I
don't have any friends.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.053
Me too.

21:10.054 --> 21:12.221
Which one?
You're new in town

21:12.222 --> 21:14.431
or you don't have any friends?
Both.

21:14.432 --> 21:17.267
Oh, cool.
We're a good match then.

21:17.268 --> 21:20.979
No, we're-we're not. I can't
be seen talking to a dog.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.024
Everyone's gonna think
that I am a major...

21:23.025 --> 21:24.942
Loser!

21:27.320 --> 21:29.822
Well, that wasn't very nice.

21:29.823 --> 21:31.657
Yeah, tell me about it.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.909
Are you done with that?

21:35.453 --> 21:37.788
Just gotta line this up,
factor in the angle,

21:37.789 --> 21:41.210
wind speed, and milkshake
viscosity, and watch!

21:54.806 --> 21:56.807
That was pretty good.

21:56.808 --> 21:58.600
I know.

21:58.601 --> 22:00.769
Who are you?

22:00.770 --> 22:03.189
Wh-what are you?

22:03.190 --> 22:05.567
You might want to
be sitting down for this.

22:08.195 --> 22:09.945
You're a robot?

22:09.946 --> 22:11.822
No, I'm not a robot.

22:11.823 --> 22:13.449
I'm a cybernetic organism.

22:13.450 --> 22:16.034
I'm made of both organic
and machine parts.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.911
Like The Terminator?

22:17.912 --> 22:19.997
Kind of, but much friendlier.

22:19.998 --> 22:22.332
I was designed to look
exactly like a normal dog,

22:22.333 --> 22:25.294
but I am quite extraordinary.
What can you do?

22:25.295 --> 22:28.215
Besides the fact that I'm
conversing with you right now?

22:28.715 --> 22:31.093
I can move at lightning speed.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.303
Prove it.

22:34.304 --> 22:37.640
Go get that Frisbee over
there and bring it back here.

22:40.185 --> 22:42.520
Wow, awesome.
Thanks.

22:45.690 --> 22:47.566
So, what else?

22:47.567 --> 22:49.444
I've got x-ray vision.

22:51.362 --> 22:53.198
Hm...

22:53.364 --> 22:55.741
what colour underwear
is that guy wearing?

22:59.163 --> 23:00.829
White.

23:00.830 --> 23:03.457
Oh wait, with a little
streak of brown.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.252
Ew.

23:06.085 --> 23:09.130
So where did you come from?

23:10.132 --> 23:12.049
I was created by
a biotech company.

23:12.050 --> 23:13.968
I was a prototype.

23:16.638 --> 23:18.972
One night, a man named Hugh,

23:18.973 --> 23:20.933
who was the night janitor
at the company,

23:20.934 --> 23:23.436
stole me from the laboratory.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.191
And, man, did he stink!

23:29.192 --> 23:31.194
It was this noxious mixture

23:31.195 --> 23:34.198
of stale corn chips
and cheap cologne. Yuck!

23:35.782 --> 23:37.699
He kept me in captivity

23:37.700 --> 23:41.036
and he threatened to shut down
my mainframe if I didn't obey.

23:41.037 --> 23:43.038
He dragged me
across the country,

23:43.039 --> 23:45.124
forcing me to commit
all kinds of crimes.

23:48.127 --> 23:52.006
Then there were the dog shows,
all that primping and preening.

23:53.091 --> 23:55.676
Don't make me go back. Please.
Do you have any idea

23:55.677 --> 23:58.845
what it's like not to have
a place to call home?

23:58.846 --> 24:01.307
Let's go. I've got an idea.

24:06.563 --> 24:09.399
Hm, knight takes rook
takes queen. Checkmate.

24:10.359 --> 24:12.360
Where'd you find him?

24:12.361 --> 24:14.361
I found him scrounging
around the dumpster

24:14.362 --> 24:16.280
behind the restaurant.

24:16.281 --> 24:19.324
He must belong to somebody.
Didn't he have a collar on? No.

24:19.325 --> 24:22.411
I don't know, Isabel.
I'm really allergic to dogs.

24:22.412 --> 24:25.247
Although this little fella
hasn't made me sneeze once.

24:25.248 --> 24:27.208
Can we keep him?

24:27.209 --> 24:29.502
I promise I will take
good care of him.

24:32.964 --> 24:34.548
Ah, okay, fine.

24:34.549 --> 24:37.593
But tomorrow take him to
the veterinarian, Mr. Neebs.

24:37.594 --> 24:39.553
He's probably got fleas.

24:39.554 --> 24:41.263
Fleas? As if.

24:41.264 --> 24:44.142
And make sure he doesn't
poo on the lawn.

24:52.275 --> 24:54.235
See ya later.

24:57.989 --> 25:00.073
I'm sorry. Poo?

25:00.074 --> 25:03.660
Do you actually... do that?

25:03.661 --> 25:05.537
Kind of a personal question.

25:05.538 --> 25:08.874
Yes, I do, but it comes
out as golden nuggets.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.417
Really?

25:10.418 --> 25:13.295
No, I'm kidding.
It's just regular old poo.

25:13.296 --> 25:15.424
I forgot my keys.

25:17.342 --> 25:19.009
Who were you talking to?

25:19.010 --> 25:21.553
Who, me? I-I-I was just
talking to Archie, here.

25:23.765 --> 25:26.434
Aw. Did he talk back?

25:29.062 --> 25:32.230
Can you talk back, buddy? Huh?

25:32.231 --> 25:35.025
You're not the brightest pup
in the litter, are you?

25:35.026 --> 25:37.445
Oh, with the election
coming up, I was wondering

25:37.446 --> 25:39.821
if maybe you'd like to be
my campaign manager?

25:39.822 --> 25:43.241
Yeah, yeah, sure, I'd love to.
But what do I need to do?

25:43.242 --> 25:45.035
Not much really.

25:45.036 --> 25:46.703
Nobody ever runs against me.

25:46.704 --> 25:50.416
Well, at least I could write
your campaign speech for you.

25:50.417 --> 25:52.501
You know how they say
there are people

25:52.502 --> 25:55.087
who fear public speaking
more than death?

25:55.088 --> 25:56.588
I'm one of those people.

25:56.589 --> 25:59.257
But we're gonna have a campaign
party at the restaurant.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.260
You can help plan that,
if you like.

26:08.310 --> 26:09.726
Did you...

26:09.727 --> 26:11.603
finish the puzzle?

26:11.604 --> 26:13.356
Uh, yeah.

26:13.357 --> 26:15.483
It really gives
your brain a workout.

26:39.173 --> 26:41.842
Can't believe I
agreed to wear a leash.

26:41.843 --> 26:45.263
I had a perfect score on the Mensa
intelligence test, ya know.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.145
Hi.

26:54.439 --> 26:56.815
What's cookin', good lookin'?

27:05.575 --> 27:08.577
Well, it seems like we keep
running into each other.

27:08.578 --> 27:11.496
Yeah, it's a small town.

27:11.497 --> 27:15.960
You can't really escape anybody,
so get used to it.

27:19.380 --> 27:22.551
I'm sorry about
the Lindsays yesterday.

27:23.092 --> 27:25.218
The Lindsays?

27:25.219 --> 27:28.472
Yeah, they can be
pretty awful sometimes.

27:28.473 --> 27:30.432
Oh.

27:30.433 --> 27:32.476
Well, it wasn't your fault.

27:32.477 --> 27:34.978
Still, it wasn't cool

27:34.979 --> 27:37.441
and I should have done
something about it.

27:39.525 --> 27:41.903
I can handle it.

27:43.279 --> 27:45.363
I didn't know you had a dog.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.575
Neither did I.

27:47.576 --> 27:49.409
I-I just found him.

27:49.410 --> 27:52.370
Your dog is beautiful.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.873
Thanks. Her name's Sally.

27:54.874 --> 27:58.503
Forswear it, sight! For I ne'er
saw true beauty till this night.

28:00.505 --> 28:03.507
Yeah, I brought her in because
she hasn't been herself lately.

28:03.508 --> 28:05.926
I'm sure the vet will
help you figure out

28:05.927 --> 28:07.469
what's wrong with her.

28:07.470 --> 28:11.057
Yeah. Clearly you haven't
met our local veterinarian.

28:11.474 --> 28:13.602
Hm.

28:16.270 --> 28:18.146
I've just experienced
love at first sight.

28:18.147 --> 28:19.856
Oh, man, it's glorious!

28:19.857 --> 28:21.399
Shhh!

28:21.400 --> 28:24.110
Can't you be happy for me
and my girlfriend?

28:24.111 --> 28:26.571
Your girlfriend?
Future girlfriend.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.701
Well, all right.

28:31.702 --> 28:33.745
Let's have a look at
this little fella.

28:38.543 --> 28:39.961
Mh-hm.

28:44.966 --> 28:47.300
Seems quite healthy.

28:47.301 --> 28:50.847
Oh, just gotta check
one more thing.

28:53.683 --> 28:55.809
Why is he putting
on a rubber glove?

28:55.810 --> 28:58.604
What's that, dear?

28:58.605 --> 29:01.231
Uh, I was just saying that
you seem to treat

29:01.232 --> 29:03.610
your patients with utter love.

29:04.193 --> 29:05.819
Oh! Yes.

29:05.820 --> 29:07.904
Well, that's why I became
a veterinarian.

29:12.827 --> 29:14.536
Ough!

29:22.670 --> 29:25.381
I think
that'll be all for today.

29:27.676 --> 29:30.511
I can't believe you did
that to the poor man.

29:30.512 --> 29:33.388
Poor man? What about me?
I'm the real victim here.

29:33.389 --> 29:34.764
Archie!

29:34.765 --> 29:36.560
Hey, c'mon.

29:39.103 --> 29:41.271
Can I walk you home?

29:41.272 --> 29:43.274
Sure.

29:44.609 --> 29:46.776
Why do you
have a service dog?

29:46.777 --> 29:48.862
Sally's not
technically my dog.

29:48.863 --> 29:50.990
She belongs to my dad.

29:52.408 --> 29:54.534
He lost his eyesight
a few years ago,

29:54.535 --> 29:57.287
so Sally's his guide dog.

29:57.288 --> 29:58.998
Oh.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.500
That's sad.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.336
Yeah.

30:04.337 --> 30:07.340
It's really sad to hear
what happened to your parents.

30:09.842 --> 30:13.011
Sometimes I...

30:13.012 --> 30:16.264
still don't really believe
it actually happened.

30:16.265 --> 30:19.060
It was all so sudden.

30:24.815 --> 30:27.400
And thanks

30:27.401 --> 30:30.904
for not saying you're sorry.

30:30.905 --> 30:33.949
It's what everyone
said to me after.

30:33.950 --> 30:37.578
"We're so sorry."
Like it was their fault.

30:37.579 --> 30:39.829
But...

30:39.830 --> 30:43.667
the truth is
it wasn't anyone's fault.

30:43.668 --> 30:46.545
It just happened.

30:53.678 --> 30:55.346
Come on.

31:01.394 --> 31:02.937
Oh!

31:04.855 --> 31:07.732
That Sally is such
a spectacular dog.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.526
I am smitten.

31:09.527 --> 31:12.737
Archie, you need to act
like a normal dog.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.031
We had way too many
close calls today.

31:15.032 --> 31:16.992
Why are you such
a negative Nellie?

31:16.993 --> 31:19.745
Okay, you know what? Fine!
Do what you like!

31:19.746 --> 31:22.623
Just don't blame me
when you get taken away.

31:22.624 --> 31:25.709
I'm sorry. I haven't exactly
been on my best behaviour.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.127
It's okay.

31:27.128 --> 31:29.379
Why have you been so good to me?

31:29.380 --> 31:32.591
I mean, you convinced your
uncle to take me in and all.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.260
You're my best friend.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.720
I am?

31:36.721 --> 31:39.055
Well, you're my only friend,

31:39.056 --> 31:42.018
which sort of makes you
my best friend by default.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.645
Best friends help
each other out.

31:44.646 --> 31:46.563
Yeah, you're right.

31:46.564 --> 31:49.733
But you should know that
I don't think I have a soul.

31:49.734 --> 31:51.651
You don't? Why not?

31:51.652 --> 31:54.780
Well because I'm just a machine.
Machines can't have souls.

31:54.781 --> 31:56.156
Can they?

31:56.157 --> 31:58.825
I really don't know.

31:58.826 --> 32:03.246
But regardless, soul or no soul,

32:03.247 --> 32:06.458
you're still my best friend.

32:06.459 --> 32:08.544
And you're mine.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.394
What do ya think?

32:26.896 --> 32:29.190
Pretty impressive, huh?

32:32.736 --> 32:34.778
Don't worry.
It's not real.

32:34.779 --> 32:36.988
I made it myself.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.365
This mascot gig
is only my day job.

32:39.366 --> 32:42.745
My true calling in life
is to open up my very own

32:42.746 --> 32:44.621
joke and novelty shop.

32:44.622 --> 32:48.124
fake poo, rubber vomit.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.418
My specialty is farting powder.

32:50.419 --> 32:52.754
I perfected the most
potent recipe.

32:52.755 --> 32:55.800
Mm, you must be so proud.

33:00.471 --> 33:03.725
This is some of my best work.

33:04.934 --> 33:07.853
I can do this.
I can do this.

33:08.938 --> 33:11.397
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Oof!

33:11.398 --> 33:13.150
Hi.

33:13.651 --> 33:15.903
No problem.
Thanks.

33:15.904 --> 33:18.696
Sorry. I'm still kind of a
liability with these things.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.325
I'm sure you're doing just fine.

33:21.785 --> 33:23.368
Um,

33:23.369 --> 33:25.954
there's a movie playing
in the park tonight, uh.

33:25.955 --> 33:28.540
Do you want to go?

33:28.541 --> 33:31.167
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

33:31.168 --> 33:34.838
Cool. Well, um, I'll wait
outside and we can go together.

33:34.839 --> 33:36.840
Yeah, yeah.
Sounds good.

33:36.841 --> 33:39.343
Cool.
Cool.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.352
The dishwasher
called in sick today.

33:49.353 --> 33:51.897
You drew the short straw.

33:51.898 --> 33:53.857
But I didn't-I didn't
draw a straw.

33:53.858 --> 33:56.442
Believe me, honey, you did.

33:56.443 --> 33:58.571
The short one.

34:02.867 --> 34:05.369
I'm never gonna get out of here.

34:07.955 --> 34:10.456
I hear we have a
movie to get to.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.806
Double date at the movies.

34:26.806 --> 34:28.766
Doesn't get more
romantic than this.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.436
Am I right?

34:36.900 --> 34:39.320
I think we're being watched.

34:41.362 --> 34:44.283
Yeah, they can be
a bit possessive.

34:46.409 --> 34:47.953
Well...

34:49.663 --> 34:51.623
at least they're both pretty.

34:52.917 --> 34:55.168
They're not my type.

34:57.171 --> 34:59.589
I can't believe she's
on a date with him.

34:59.590 --> 35:02.968
I know! It's completely
unbelievable.

35:12.854 --> 35:15.813
Okay, sorry. I don't know
why I did that.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.148
What?

35:17.149 --> 35:19.484
It's just the whole
arm-stretch thing

35:19.485 --> 35:21.277
is just super dorky.

35:21.278 --> 35:22.947
It's okay.

35:23.572 --> 35:25.241
I don't mind.

35:32.539 --> 35:35.000
Un-freaking-believable!

35:35.001 --> 35:36.835
Oh! That's it!

35:42.008 --> 35:44.550
So, you're a guide dog, huh?

35:44.551 --> 35:46.594
That's, uh, that's cool.

35:46.595 --> 35:49.640
I have a lot of talents myself,
you may have noticed.

35:50.641 --> 35:52.184
Or not.

35:58.399 --> 36:02.193
Uh-oh, looks like I need to step
in here and save the day.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.904
Again.

36:03.905 --> 36:06.155
Will you excuse me, Sally?

36:06.156 --> 36:07.908
Tough crowd.

36:13.039 --> 36:15.623
Space Milkshake.
Okay, I can find this.

36:16.959 --> 36:20.879
Here we go. And looking,
searching, and got it!

36:47.115 --> 36:49.950
My kingdom for a WiFi signal.

36:49.951 --> 36:52.035
I can get you online.

36:52.036 --> 36:54.037
You can?
Sure.

36:55.789 --> 36:58.166
Yes! Civilization!

36:58.167 --> 37:00.586
The password is
Archie is awesome.

37:01.086 --> 37:03.589
I'm kidding.
There is no password.

37:04.089 --> 37:06.549
Hey, honey, we're just
leaving for the school now,

37:06.550 --> 37:09.970
but we wanted to tell
you how proud of you we are.

37:09.971 --> 37:11.888
Look, your father's
even wearing a tie.

37:11.889 --> 37:13.723
Of course I'm wearing a tie.

37:13.724 --> 37:15.516
My daughter just
won the presidency.

37:15.517 --> 37:18.519
I want to look good
for the inaugural ball.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.981
We love you so much, Izzy.
See you soon.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.154
You okay?

37:28.739 --> 37:31.033
It's just hard sometimes.

37:35.121 --> 37:37.289
All the time.

37:40.334 --> 37:44.588
I had just won the student
council election at my school.

37:45.631 --> 37:49.176
I was only in grade 10, but...

37:49.177 --> 37:52.470
my parents were always
helping me

37:52.471 --> 37:55.182
and supporting me.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.769
That's what they were like.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.272
They used to put
these handwritten,

38:03.273 --> 38:07.110
inspirational messages in
my backpack or in my lunch.

38:07.111 --> 38:10.239
"If you can dream it,
you can do it."

38:11.657 --> 38:14.243
They were such dorks.

38:21.209 --> 38:26.046
It's... crazy to think how
quickly life can change.

38:30.717 --> 38:34.222
I guess I
really am an orphan now.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.017
Me too.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.562
I never really had a family...

38:42.563 --> 38:45.023
until now.

39:04.793 --> 39:06.794
I've gotta go to work.

39:06.795 --> 39:08.796
I'm gonna be busy all day.

39:08.797 --> 39:11.048
Paul's campaign party
is tonight.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.260
You gonna be able
to behave yourself?

39:13.261 --> 39:16.054
Hey-hey, it's Archie
you're talking to.

39:20.267 --> 39:22.602
Sally, Sally, Sally,
Sally, Sally, Sally, Sally...

39:22.603 --> 39:24.729
Hello, Sally!

39:24.730 --> 39:27.231
This is our signature dish.

39:27.232 --> 39:31.152
Secret recipe that
goes back generations.

39:31.153 --> 39:33.113
Chili.

39:33.114 --> 39:36.117
The holy grail of chili.

39:37.243 --> 39:39.076
Now, with the rest of the staff

39:39.077 --> 39:41.120
busy preparing for the party
this evening,

39:41.121 --> 39:45.208
you have been assigned the most
important job of all:

39:45.209 --> 39:48.211
the guardian of the chili.

39:48.212 --> 39:50.631
I accept.

39:55.636 --> 39:59.805
don't
take your eyes off the chili.

39:59.806 --> 40:01.641
Second rule of chili,

40:01.642 --> 40:03.268
don't...

40:03.269 --> 40:05.187
take your eyes...

40:05.188 --> 40:07.689
off the chili.

40:18.867 --> 40:21.244
♪ Bum bum bum bum,
Ba-Ba bum bum ♪

40:21.245 --> 40:23.704
♪ bum bum bum bum Ba-Ba
bum bum ♪

40:23.705 --> 40:25.541

40:28.126 --> 40:30.296
What the...?

40:49.523 --> 40:52.193
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

40:53.026 --> 40:54.611
Okay.

41:01.952 --> 41:03.995
Oh hello, Paul.

41:03.996 --> 41:06.914
Fancy seeing you here
in enemy territory.

41:06.915 --> 41:09.334
Veronica, what are you doing?

41:09.335 --> 41:12.003
What does it look like, silly?
I'm running for mayor.

41:13.797 --> 41:16.048
But you don't even live here.

41:16.049 --> 41:18.635
Oh, I do now. I bought
a house this morning.

41:22.306 --> 41:24.349
Since when did you ever
have any interest

41:24.350 --> 41:26.434
in running for mayor
of Deanewood?

41:26.435 --> 41:29.770
I've always wanted to give
back to the community,

41:29.771 --> 41:31.606
and I figured what better way

41:31.607 --> 41:33.899
than at the municipal level
in my hometown.

41:35.569 --> 41:37.862
Veronica, you're kidding
yourself if you think

41:37.863 --> 41:41.199
the people of Deanewood are
gonna side with you over me.

41:45.829 --> 41:48.540
We'll just see about that.

42:18.278 --> 42:21.449
Hey, check out
what I found online.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.618
Coolest thing I've
ever seen in my life!

42:25.619 --> 42:29.121
I should hire this dog to work
at my novelty store.

42:29.122 --> 42:31.292
I wonder who his agent is.

42:36.963 --> 42:39.007
Ooh oh!

42:43.762 --> 42:45.304
Get me a WiFi signal.

42:45.305 --> 42:47.723
I can't. The Internet
is down. Everywhere.

42:47.724 --> 42:49.392
On earth.

42:49.393 --> 42:51.978
Get me a WiFi signal.
Okay.

42:53.855 --> 42:56.065
Archie, I told you
not to show off.

42:56.066 --> 42:58.442
I-I told you to act
like a normal dog.

42:58.443 --> 43:01.445
I'm sorry, but I was doing it
to try impress Sally.

43:01.446 --> 43:04.324
She's got no time for me.
It's driving me crazy!

43:04.325 --> 43:06.492
Look, if we don't get
these taken down,

43:06.493 --> 43:09.371
they're gonna go viral.
Well, let's hope so.

43:09.372 --> 43:11.872
Sorry, you're right.
Let's get them taken down.

43:11.873 --> 43:14.251
How do we do that?

43:27.431 --> 43:29.682
Hi. I need your help.

43:29.683 --> 43:32.269
Sure, what's up?

43:32.978 --> 43:35.604
There's something you
should know about Archie.

43:35.605 --> 43:37.857
He's not a normal dog.

43:37.858 --> 43:41.152
I know. I saw him in the park.
That was pretty impressive.

43:41.153 --> 43:43.612
I didn't know he could
do all those tricks.

43:43.613 --> 43:46.240
That's not all he can do.

43:46.241 --> 43:48.409
Really, like what?

43:48.410 --> 43:50.119
Well, I can talk.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.414
Ha. Yeah, that's cool.

43:57.043 --> 43:59.336
D-d-did you just...
Did he just...

43:59.337 --> 44:01.630
Yes. Okay, here's the highlight
reel. I'm a robot.

44:01.631 --> 44:04.467
People are looking for me
and we're wondering if you know

44:04.468 --> 44:07.678
how to get some pictures of me
down from the Internet?

44:07.679 --> 44:11.098
Uh, um, uh yeah.
Yeah, I think I can.

44:11.099 --> 44:13.559
Great. We'll explain the rest later.
But-but I...

44:13.560 --> 44:15.270
Shh. I know it's a lot.

45:02.609 --> 45:04.444
Hi.
Hi.

45:04.445 --> 45:06.904
Can I, uh, help you?

45:06.905 --> 45:08.906
Yeah, yeah.

45:08.907 --> 45:11.200
I'm kinda hungry.
It's a long drive.

45:11.201 --> 45:13.953
Um, what's good here?

45:13.954 --> 45:16.831
Uh, oh, well, everything.

45:16.832 --> 45:19.376
Oh, okay. Um...

45:20.710 --> 45:23.754
I don't really eat a
lot of fast food, so.

45:23.755 --> 45:26.882
Well, we don't really
serve fast food.

45:26.883 --> 45:29.426
I mean it's fast
and it's food, obviously,

45:29.427 --> 45:32.054
but it's not fast food per se.

45:32.055 --> 45:35.391
I like to call it
"slow food, made fast."

45:36.768 --> 45:39.562
That's impressive.

45:39.563 --> 45:41.105
I guess you're the owner?

45:41.106 --> 45:43.190
Yeah, yeah.
My name's Paul.

45:43.191 --> 45:46.735
I'm Brooke. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

45:46.736 --> 45:49.655
So what brings you to town?

45:49.656 --> 45:52.366
You just passing through?

45:52.367 --> 45:56.912
No, um, actually,
it's gonna sounds strange.

45:56.913 --> 45:59.248
I'm looking for a dog.

45:59.249 --> 46:01.917
He's my dog.
I'm looking for my dog.

46:01.918 --> 46:03.586
I lost him.

46:03.587 --> 46:06.714
Um, I think he might have
ended up here. Here?

46:06.715 --> 46:08.716
How would that have happened?
Yeah.

46:08.717 --> 46:11.635
I guess you could say
he was being shipped

46:11.636 --> 46:14.179
across the country
and he got loose

46:14.180 --> 46:16.056
and might be in this area.

46:16.057 --> 46:18.434
You haven't seen a strange
dog wandering around here,

46:18.435 --> 46:20.686
As a matter of fact, I have.
Have you?

46:20.687 --> 46:23.899
My niece found a stray dog.
We've just taken him in.

46:26.192 --> 46:27.902
Hey.

46:27.903 --> 46:29.653
You okay?

46:29.654 --> 46:32.615
Yeah, I'm just stirring the
chili. It's quite a workout.

46:32.616 --> 46:36.452
Ah. Oh, uh, this is Brooke
and she lost her dog.

46:36.453 --> 46:38.454
Yeah. Is this him?

46:38.455 --> 46:40.706
No, definitely not.

46:40.707 --> 46:43.584
I don't know.
It kinda looks like him.

46:43.585 --> 46:45.753
N-no, not at all.

46:45.754 --> 46:48.547
I-I'd like to see him,
just to be sure.

46:48.548 --> 46:50.550
Well, you can't.

46:50.551 --> 46:53.427
I mean, you could
if I still had him,

46:53.428 --> 46:55.721
but I don't anymore.
He ran away.

46:55.722 --> 46:57.765
You didn't tell me
Archie ran away.

46:57.766 --> 46:59.935
Archie?

47:00.769 --> 47:02.686
Well, I'm sure he'll
show up again soon.

47:02.687 --> 47:05.314
And we're having a function
at the restaurant tonight.

47:05.315 --> 47:07.650
Maybe you want to come by.
Okay, sure, yeah!

47:07.651 --> 47:09.778
Okay.
Yeah.

47:23.458 --> 47:25.250
Heh heh heh heh!

47:25.251 --> 47:27.629
I'm gonna get that robot.

47:29.631 --> 47:32.760
What are you looking at?

47:34.594 --> 47:36.387
Is that my wig?

47:38.139 --> 47:40.976
Looks pretty good on ya.

47:53.279 --> 47:55.573
How you doing? Good to see you.

47:57.617 --> 47:59.535
Hey, guys.

47:59.536 --> 48:02.746
Your chili burger alone
is worth my vote, Paul.

48:02.747 --> 48:05.040
I wish you'd give me the recipe!

48:05.041 --> 48:07.710
Sorry, Madge, it's an ancient
Sullivan family secret.

48:07.711 --> 48:09.294
Excuse me.
Mm.

48:09.295 --> 48:10.879
Hi.
Hi.

48:10.880 --> 48:12.840
Welcome back.

48:12.841 --> 48:16.051
Thanks. I'm just wondering
if my dog has shown up yet?

48:16.052 --> 48:19.763
Uh, no, no, I haven't seen him.
But-but you should stick around.

48:19.764 --> 48:22.975
You know, in case
he does show up again.

48:22.976 --> 48:24.768
Would you like a chili burger?

48:24.769 --> 48:28.397
Sure! Yeah.
Yeah.

48:28.398 --> 48:30.899
Uh, one second.

48:30.900 --> 48:34.111
Hi, I'm Paul.
I don't believe we've met.

48:34.112 --> 48:37.239
Health inspector. I'd like
to take a look around.

48:37.240 --> 48:41.618
Uh, sure. Can I ask
what this is about?

48:41.619 --> 48:43.996
Routine check.

48:43.997 --> 48:46.832
Routine check at
8pm on a Saturday?

48:46.833 --> 48:49.585
There are over 70 trillion
types of bacteria

48:49.586 --> 48:54.214
and they don't just work 9 to 5,
therefore neither do I.

48:54.215 --> 48:57.218
Now, can you direct
me to the kitchen.

48:59.054 --> 49:00.846
Uh, yeah, sure.
It's this way.

49:00.847 --> 49:02.766
Excuse me.

49:05.602 --> 49:07.395
Archie!

49:18.741 --> 49:20.825
Hello.

49:28.166 --> 49:31.627
Mr. Sullivan, I couldn't find
one single health code violation

49:31.628 --> 49:33.880
in this entire establishment.

49:33.881 --> 49:36.048
Believe me, I tried.

49:36.049 --> 49:39.385
Well, we run an airtight
ship around here.

49:41.346 --> 49:42.721
Oh my.

50:50.498 --> 50:53.500
You didn't happen to have
a chili burger, did you?

50:53.501 --> 50:55.670
No, I ate a trumpet for dinner.

50:59.507 --> 51:02.551
You took your eye off
the chili, didn't you?

51:04.762 --> 51:07.098
Excuse me.

51:22.947 --> 51:24.907
You okay?

51:24.908 --> 51:27.368
This is terrible.

51:29.787 --> 51:32.957
The health inspector's gonna
put us under investigation.

51:32.958 --> 51:34.958
Fartgate.

51:34.959 --> 51:38.378
It could cost me the restaurant
and the election.

51:40.798 --> 51:42.925
Remember I told you

51:42.926 --> 51:45.552
you didn't have to write
me a campaign speech?

51:45.553 --> 51:47.095
Scratch that.

51:47.096 --> 51:50.016
I need you to write me
the best campaign speech

51:50.017 --> 51:52.310
in the history
of campaign speeches.

51:57.190 --> 52:00.235
I feel so bad for letting
Paul down like this.

52:00.818 --> 52:02.569
Hey.

52:02.570 --> 52:05.114
Oh man. It's my poster.

52:07.492 --> 52:09.576
The Lindsays came into
the arcade tonight.

52:09.577 --> 52:12.162
They let it slip that
they're helping Veronica.

52:12.163 --> 52:13.956
She got them to spike the chili.

52:13.957 --> 52:15.708
Dirty politics.

52:18.879 --> 52:20.963
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

52:20.964 --> 52:24.425
Oh yeah.
It's time to go incognito.

52:55.790 --> 52:57.791
All right, let's rock and roll.

52:57.792 --> 53:00.045
Everybody stay frosty.

53:00.628 --> 53:03.047
What? I always
wanted to say that.

53:03.923 --> 53:05.757
All right, let's split up.

53:05.758 --> 53:07.217
And whatever you do,

53:07.218 --> 53:09.261
make sure you keep
Veronica distracted.

53:09.262 --> 53:12.015
I'll be back.

53:24.902 --> 53:27.070
Have we met?

53:27.071 --> 53:29.990
I don't believe so.

53:29.991 --> 53:32.994
What publication did you
say you were from again?

53:32.995 --> 53:35.537
The um, the um,
the Global Gazette.

53:35.538 --> 53:39.917
We're a very small
online news outlet.

53:48.259 --> 53:51.012
There's no cause greater
to my heart than helping people.

53:52.555 --> 53:55.891
Some people say that I'm
selfless, that I'm a hero,

53:55.892 --> 53:58.393
but I don't see myself that way.

53:58.394 --> 54:00.937
I think I know that
girl from somewhere.

54:00.938 --> 54:02.481
Hm.

54:02.482 --> 54:05.151
And as mayor,
what would you say

54:05.152 --> 54:07.612
that your first
priorities would be?

54:10.406 --> 54:13.534
To expose cheats.

54:14.327 --> 54:17.704
You may think that you have
pulled a fast one on me,

54:17.705 --> 54:19.790
but I am on to you.

54:19.791 --> 54:22.584
Never try to outsmart
a con woman.

55:02.208 --> 55:05.128
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

55:21.018 --> 55:23.646
Whoa, this
is like geek heaven.

55:24.814 --> 55:27.732
Yeah. Basically every penny
that I've made at the arcade

55:27.733 --> 55:29.734
goes to buying this stuff.

55:29.735 --> 55:31.611
Check out this setup.

55:31.612 --> 55:34.240
You've even got "movie trailer
voice" on this thing.

55:34.241 --> 55:36.700
Archie... part dog,

55:36.701 --> 55:38.910
part machine,

55:38.911 --> 55:41.164
totally awesome.

55:42.748 --> 55:44.333
I like this guy.

55:50.465 --> 55:53.175
Uh, you guys, I don't know
if we should be

55:53.176 --> 55:55.135
hacking into someone's email.

55:55.136 --> 55:57.179
It doesn't feel right.

55:57.180 --> 55:59.222
For the record,
I didn't hack in.

55:59.223 --> 56:01.308
Her email was open.
I merely observed.

56:01.309 --> 56:04.229
Besides, you won't feel bad
when you see this.

56:07.107 --> 56:09.149
Look at this chain of
emails between Veronica

56:09.150 --> 56:13.069
and somebody named Kim
Mathers... Matthews.

56:13.070 --> 56:17.032
Kim Matthews is the CEO
of Mogulburger.

56:17.033 --> 56:18.867
Look at this.

56:18.868 --> 56:21.244
"Dear Kim, it seems
that my first attempt

56:21.245 --> 56:24.122
"at buying out the Bluebird Cafe
has proven unsuccessful.

56:24.123 --> 56:27.251
"However I have come up
with a new tactic

56:27.252 --> 56:29.920
that will be much more
effective and less expensive."

56:29.921 --> 56:32.340
What does that mean?

56:33.549 --> 56:35.926
It means that Veronica
is running for mayor

56:35.927 --> 56:37.886
to put Paul out of business.

56:37.887 --> 56:39.471
Can she do that?

56:39.472 --> 56:42.182
If she becomes mayor,
she can change the zoning code

56:42.183 --> 56:44.267
and revoke his food
service licence.

56:44.268 --> 56:46.353
And she already got
Paul a bad report

56:46.354 --> 56:48.813
from the health inspector.
We need to stop her.

56:48.814 --> 56:52.817
We have the evidence here. How are
we going to explain how we got it?

56:52.818 --> 56:55.071
We need to catch her in the act.

57:01.202 --> 57:03.829
Seems we got a common enemy.

57:04.497 --> 57:08.083
Oh? We do, do we?

57:10.920 --> 57:12.880
You said "do do."

57:16.176 --> 57:18.635
No, but seriously, we should
totally team up.

57:18.636 --> 57:20.595
Yes, maybe we should.

57:20.596 --> 57:23.181
Oh, oohh! Oh-ho! Oh!!

57:23.182 --> 57:25.308
You stay away from
me, you creep!

57:25.309 --> 57:28.645
Argh! No, no, I mean the dog.
The dog's our common enemy.

57:28.646 --> 57:30.564
The dog with the kids! What dog?

57:30.565 --> 57:33.567
I don't care about the dog.
I wanna stop those kids.

57:33.568 --> 57:36.278
I don't care about those kids.
I want the dog!

57:36.279 --> 57:39.115
That's why I'm saying
we should team up.

57:41.742 --> 57:45.247
Yes. Maybe we should.

57:46.622 --> 57:49.625
You're not gonna spray me again
with that thing, are ya?

57:54.589 --> 57:56.631
I think it's disgusting
that Mayor Sullivan

57:56.632 --> 57:59.801
would resort to such dirty
tactics as having his niece

57:59.802 --> 58:01.553
engage in political espionage.

58:01.554 --> 58:05.308
I want a fair election.
Clearly, he does not.

58:12.440 --> 58:14.358
This made the national news.

58:14.359 --> 58:16.192
I-I-I was just
trying to help.

58:16.193 --> 58:20.406
Well don't. Please.
What are you saying?

58:20.407 --> 58:22.824
Do you want me off the campaign?

58:22.825 --> 58:25.035
I'm sorry, but yes.

58:25.036 --> 58:27.496
I can't afford
any more disasters.

58:38.215 --> 58:41.176
I can't believe I messed
everything up so badly.

58:41.177 --> 58:43.595
It wasn't just you.

58:43.596 --> 58:45.555
It was all of us.

58:45.556 --> 58:47.432
What a disaster.

58:47.433 --> 58:51.227
Why wasn't I invited?
Invited to where?

58:51.228 --> 58:53.980
To the pity party you guys
are throwing for yourselves.

58:53.981 --> 58:56.691
This defeatist attitude is
not gonna get us anywhere.

58:56.692 --> 58:58.735
You can't give up so easily.

58:58.736 --> 59:01.488
Our luck could turn
at any minute.

59:01.489 --> 59:03.324
How?

59:04.241 --> 59:06.826
I'm very close to
accomplishing my mission.

59:06.827 --> 59:09.621
Let's meet tomorrow at
1:00 to sign the papers.

59:09.622 --> 59:11.998
It's got to be at
a secret location.

59:11.999 --> 59:14.042
I don't want any witnesses.

59:14.043 --> 59:16.044
There's an abandoned
concert grounds

59:16.045 --> 59:17.962
out by Highway 12
and Service Road.

59:17.963 --> 59:20.467
See you there.

59:25.888 --> 59:28.350
Looks like we're
back in business.

59:45.991 --> 59:48.953
Doesn't look like
anybody's here.

59:50.372 --> 59:52.289
Let's get out and take a look.

01:00:06.929 --> 01:00:09.974
There's nobody here.

01:00:10.516 --> 01:00:12.309
I don't know.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.522
I got a bad feeling about this.

01:00:18.358 --> 01:00:21.193
Corn chips and cheap cologne.

01:00:29.494 --> 01:00:31.537
Heh, heh, heh!

01:00:31.538 --> 01:00:33.371
Hugh!

01:00:33.372 --> 01:00:35.790
Get in the box.

01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:39.794
Ha ha ha, look who it is.

01:00:39.795 --> 01:00:42.338
Oh ho ho, just back
off there, sporto.

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:45.341
I don't want to have to shut
down this dog's mainframe.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:48.136
It could erase his memory.
You don't want that, do ya?

01:00:48.137 --> 01:00:50.263
You'd better do as he says.
Archie, no.

01:00:50.264 --> 01:00:52.348
I'd rather have it like this

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.560
than risk losing the memories
of our friendship.

01:00:54.561 --> 01:00:57.188
Yeah, listen to the
mutt and cooperate with us.

01:00:58.564 --> 01:01:00.356
Come on, time to go back.

01:01:03.736 --> 01:01:05.653
Us?

01:01:05.654 --> 01:01:08.198
Well, well, well,

01:01:08.199 --> 01:01:10.576
if it isn't the crack
investigative journalists

01:01:10.577 --> 01:01:12.411
of the Global Gazette.

01:01:16.541 --> 01:01:19.793
So you're working with
the infamous Hugh.

01:01:19.794 --> 01:01:23.422
If you make the right deals
in life, you get ahead.

01:01:23.423 --> 01:01:25.131
Speaking of deals,
are we square?

01:01:25.132 --> 01:01:27.008
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good.

01:01:27.009 --> 01:01:29.761
What you want with that
mangy dog, I have no idea.

01:01:29.762 --> 01:01:32.764
You'd be surprised what this
little fella's gonna get me

01:01:32.765 --> 01:01:35.141
on the black market.
Heh heh heh heh!

01:01:35.142 --> 01:01:37.393
Anyway, pleasure doing
business with ya.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:40.480
Oh, do you like monster trucks?

01:01:40.481 --> 01:01:44.068
You know, big wheels,
a lotta torque?

01:01:46.695 --> 01:01:48.364
Never mind.

01:01:50.366 --> 01:01:53.451
So, you two should be safe in
here until after the election

01:01:53.452 --> 01:01:56.955
and I'm the new mayor
of Deanewood.

01:01:56.956 --> 01:02:00.167
Never try to outsmart
a con woman.

01:02:10.177 --> 01:02:12.136
No, no, no! Don't sell!

01:02:12.137 --> 01:02:14.973
Ralph, Ralph, look, I just
need a couple more days.

01:02:14.974 --> 01:02:16.933
I'm gonna get you the money.

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.018
Yeah! What?

01:02:19.019 --> 01:02:21.020
Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.070
What the crap!

01:02:39.039 --> 01:02:41.292
Hey, hey! Hey!

01:02:55.431 --> 01:02:57.682
Are you crazy? Where is he?
Give him back!

01:02:57.683 --> 01:02:59.643
You? What are you-?

01:02:59.644 --> 01:03:03.104
Oh no, it's mine. You gave it
to me, it's mine. I did not!

01:03:03.105 --> 01:03:05.315
I paid you to steal him for me

01:03:05.316 --> 01:03:07.651
and you never showed up
at the meeting place.

01:03:07.652 --> 01:03:10.529
Yeah, that the piddly little
sum you were gonna pay me

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:13.031
for him is nothing compared
to what we can make

01:03:13.032 --> 01:03:14.699
out on the road together.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.534
Stealing?
No, working the system.

01:03:16.535 --> 01:03:19.579
Oh, I thought we were friends.
See, yeah, that's the problem.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.957
That's all you ever thought
we were, but I wanted more.

01:03:22.958 --> 01:03:24.542
I mean, didn't you ever notice

01:03:24.543 --> 01:03:27.503
that I would always empty
your trash can first?

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.131
Or that if there was only
one blueberry muffin

01:03:30.132 --> 01:03:32.800
left in the cafeteria,
I'd save it for ya?

01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:35.219
I mean, I thought we
coulda been soul mates.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.388
I had no idea.
Oh my god, Hugh.

01:03:37.389 --> 01:03:39.725
Yeah, well forget it.
I don't care any more.

01:03:39.726 --> 01:03:42.435
I was gonna name my new
monster truck after you,

01:03:42.436 --> 01:03:44.270
but not anymore.

01:03:44.271 --> 01:03:47.106
I am very sorry if I gave
you the wrong impression,

01:03:47.107 --> 01:03:49.609
but I need my dog back, Hugh!

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:54.072
Yeah, you want your mangy,
little furry mutt robot back?

01:03:54.073 --> 01:03:56.157
Okay, I'll give it to ya, sure.

01:03:56.158 --> 01:03:58.826
But for 10 times the price
we agreed on.

01:03:58.827 --> 01:04:00.579
Otherwise, you know,
I don't care.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.413
I got another guy all lined up.

01:04:02.414 --> 01:04:04.540
You know what,
I have a better idea.

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:06.752
It's contained in this
little doo-da right here.

01:04:06.753 --> 01:04:10.046
Do you know what that is?
Have you ever seen one before?

01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:13.592
It contains the security
footage from Cyborganix

01:04:13.593 --> 01:04:15.259
of you stealing Archie.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.721
So that's fine.
Thank you. Bye bye.

01:04:17.722 --> 01:04:19.514
No! You turned all that off!

01:04:19.515 --> 01:04:23.017
Kept a little something for
myself in case you got greedy.

01:04:23.018 --> 01:04:24.686
You're bluffing.

01:04:24.687 --> 01:04:26.688
Am I?

01:04:26.689 --> 01:04:29.775
You really think I would
just blindly trust you?

01:04:29.776 --> 01:04:31.484
That's fine.

01:04:31.485 --> 01:04:34.862
I'm sure the federal authorities
would love to see this.

01:04:34.863 --> 01:04:36.782
Wait!

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:52.381
Give it.

01:04:55.677 --> 01:04:59.095
You know, one day you're gonna
regret letting a guy like me

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:01.598
slip through your fingers.

01:05:03.685 --> 01:05:05.978
Stupid mutt anyway.

01:05:23.454 --> 01:05:25.038
Man, I hate this thing.

01:05:25.039 --> 01:05:27.165
Thanks for letting me out.

01:05:27.166 --> 01:05:29.542
Wait, I-I know
you, don't I?

01:05:29.543 --> 01:05:32.671
You, You-you made me!

01:05:32.672 --> 01:05:34.798
Yes, I did.

01:05:34.799 --> 01:05:36.340
Are you God?

01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:37.800
No!

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:39.635
Are you my mother?

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:41.846
No. I, uh, I'm not your mother.

01:05:41.847 --> 01:05:44.307
I'm just Brooke.

01:05:44.308 --> 01:05:47.101
Well that's...
kinda anticlimactic.

01:05:47.102 --> 01:05:50.188
Okay, come on. Let's go.
We gotta get you home.

01:05:50.189 --> 01:05:52.690
Wait, I have some friends
who are in trouble.

01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:55.069
I have to save them.
I need your help.

01:06:00.783 --> 01:06:03.826
Locked from the outside. Why
don't you tackle it down.

01:06:03.827 --> 01:06:05.745
You're on the
football team, right?

01:06:05.746 --> 01:06:08.581
Yeah, but I'm a quarterback.
I just... I don't...

01:06:08.582 --> 01:06:11.251
Just, let me give it a shot.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.843
Archie!

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:23.847
You didn't think I'd just
leave you here, did you?

01:06:23.848 --> 01:06:26.808
Guys, I'd like you
to meet Brooke,

01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:28.852
my creator.

01:06:35.734 --> 01:06:37.736
So,

01:06:37.737 --> 01:06:39.863
Archie is really your dog?

01:06:39.864 --> 01:06:41.739
Yes, sort of.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.283
I'm a roboticist.

01:06:44.284 --> 01:06:49.080
I invented the technology
to create a robotic dog,

01:06:49.081 --> 01:06:51.499
one that would have a
much longer lifespan

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.753
and possess special abilities
to help people in need.

01:06:54.754 --> 01:06:56.838
Archie was the prototype.

01:06:56.839 --> 01:06:58.799
It's like service animals.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.843
On top of that, I also
gave him a personality,

01:07:01.844 --> 01:07:04.888
a voice, and a sense of humour.

01:07:04.889 --> 01:07:07.181
And then my company
got bought out

01:07:07.182 --> 01:07:09.935
by a huge corporation
with a very lucrative

01:07:09.936 --> 01:07:11.811
military contract

01:07:11.812 --> 01:07:15.481
and they had other ideas
for the Archie project.

01:07:15.482 --> 01:07:19.986
They wanted to use
the dogs for warfare.

01:07:19.987 --> 01:07:23.197
I could not support that.

01:07:23.198 --> 01:07:26.492
So I had him stolen instead!

01:07:26.493 --> 01:07:28.578
I made a deal with Hugh.

01:07:28.579 --> 01:07:30.997
I thought I could trust him.

01:07:30.998 --> 01:07:32.999
And I was wrong.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.835
Well, how did you get
Hugh to give Archie back?

01:07:35.836 --> 01:07:38.629
I kept a memory stick
that had footage of him

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:42.133
stealing Archie from the lab,
so I sort of forced a trade.

01:07:42.134 --> 01:07:44.302
So...

01:07:44.303 --> 01:07:48.472
do you have to take
Archie with you now?

01:07:48.473 --> 01:07:50.975
Yeah, I guess I do.

01:07:50.976 --> 01:07:53.895
I can be a normal dog.
I promise!

01:07:53.896 --> 01:07:56.898
But you're not a normal dog,
are you?

01:07:56.899 --> 01:08:00.318
Sorry, it's just too dangerous
for you to stay here.

01:08:00.319 --> 01:08:03.989
Please, Brooke,
I can't leave yet.

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:05.866
I have to help Isabel
with something.

01:08:05.867 --> 01:08:08.160
It's really important.

01:08:11.873 --> 01:08:13.998
You know what? It's been
a really long day.

01:08:13.999 --> 01:08:16.375
I could use a shower,
something to eat, even,

01:08:16.376 --> 01:08:19.962
before I drive all the way home,
so I guess I could let

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:22.798
you guys have a little more
time together. Okay?

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:25.051
Thank you.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:32.475
Okay, the election is tonight.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:35.560
We have to stop Veronica.
This could be our last chance.

01:08:35.562 --> 01:08:37.438
I've got an idea.

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:40.274
You've got to call Veronica's
cell in precisely 90 seconds

01:08:40.274 --> 01:08:43.486
and pretend you're Kim Matthews,
the CEO of Mogulburger.

01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:45.279
Tell her that you're
having second thoughts

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.323
about investing in Deanewood.

01:08:58.417 --> 01:08:59.962
Here we go.

01:09:14.475 --> 01:09:17.603
Kim, darling. How are you?

01:09:17.604 --> 01:09:20.147
Uh, hi, Veronica.

01:09:20.148 --> 01:09:22.901
This is definitely Kim Mathers.

01:09:22.902 --> 01:09:25.903
Matthews!
Matthews, I mean!

01:09:25.904 --> 01:09:28.363
Why are you speaking
in that high voice?

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:30.700
Are you getting sick?

01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:32.953
He's a guy!

01:09:32.953 --> 01:09:36.663
Um, yeah.

01:09:36.665 --> 01:09:41.086
I've come down with that
bizarre strain of laryngitis

01:09:41.087 --> 01:09:44.755
that causes your voice
to raise several octaves.

01:09:44.756 --> 01:09:47.216
Oh, that's terrible!

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.510
Be sure to rest up
and get better.

01:09:49.511 --> 01:09:52.179
I'm gonna need you
to fly out here soon.

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:55.016
Things are going as planned.
Wink, wink.

01:09:55.017 --> 01:09:57.143
Uh, yeah, about that.

01:09:57.144 --> 01:10:00.187
I've been having second
thoughts about putting

01:10:00.188 --> 01:10:02.857
a Mogulburger location
in uh, uh...

01:10:02.858 --> 01:10:05.901
what's that town called again?

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:08.195
Deanewood, is it?

01:10:08.196 --> 01:10:10.906
Why are you
having second thoughts?

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:12.325
I cannot stress this enough.

01:10:12.326 --> 01:10:14.035
A Mogulburger location here

01:10:14.036 --> 01:10:16.746
would be extremely lucrative
for the company.

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:22.168
Well, isn't there already a
burger joint in that location?

01:10:22.169 --> 01:10:25.921
An amazing one,
with amazing food!

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:27.923
Or so I've heard.

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.967
Oh please!

01:10:29.968 --> 01:10:32.553
It's a small business,
a mom-and-pop shop,

01:10:32.554 --> 01:10:34.764
just like every other
pathetic establishment

01:10:34.765 --> 01:10:37.142
in this two-bit, one-horse town.

01:10:37.143 --> 01:10:39.143
We can be on the forefront

01:10:39.144 --> 01:10:41.896
of running these independent
companies into the ground

01:10:41.897 --> 01:10:44.690
and bring in a Megaplex mall.

01:10:44.691 --> 01:10:48.486
This place won't even be a
town when I'm through with it.

01:10:48.487 --> 01:10:51.114
It'll just be another nook
of consumerism

01:10:51.115 --> 01:10:53.784
with Mogulburger as its king.

01:10:55.911 --> 01:10:57.579
Okay, sounds good. Bye!

01:11:05.712 --> 01:11:07.671
That went well.

01:11:09.174 --> 01:11:11.300
Alrighty, I got all
the raw footage.

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:13.011
Okay.

01:11:13.012 --> 01:11:14.887
The debate's in two hours.

01:11:14.888 --> 01:11:17.473
We gotta get this together fast.

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:20.477
All right. Game on.

01:11:25.107 --> 01:11:28.193
I'm really gonna miss you...

01:11:28.194 --> 01:11:30.903
when this is all over.

01:11:30.904 --> 01:11:33.074
Me too.

01:11:39.287 --> 01:11:42.832
Justin.
Happy birthday!

01:11:48.047 --> 01:11:50.132
Brooke!

01:11:54.594 --> 01:11:57.847
Oh no. No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!

01:11:57.848 --> 01:12:01.226
No, no, no, no!

01:12:01.227 --> 01:12:05.188
No, no, no, no, no!!

01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:10.818
No! No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!!

01:12:12.946 --> 01:12:15.407
Nooooo!

01:12:35.469 --> 01:12:37.470
Good evening.

01:12:37.471 --> 01:12:39.930
He's dying up there.

01:12:39.931 --> 01:12:42.057
Okay, you guys go set up.

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:44.436
I've gotta give
Uncle Paul his speech.

01:12:48.899 --> 01:12:50.941
I've so got this.

01:12:50.942 --> 01:12:52.902
Uncle Paul.

01:12:52.903 --> 01:12:55.197
You forgot your campaign speech.

01:13:02.162 --> 01:13:04.165
Trust me.

01:13:04.873 --> 01:13:07.042
Uh, hi!

01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:14.965
You all know me
as a man of action,

01:13:14.966 --> 01:13:17.968
not so much words.

01:13:17.969 --> 01:13:20.054
I believe in the mantra

01:13:20.055 --> 01:13:22.182
that a person should be measured

01:13:22.183 --> 01:13:25.059
not by what they say,
but by what they do.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:28.229
And over my time as mayor,
I think you all know

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.274
that I have tried to
remain true to that.

01:13:31.275 --> 01:13:33.317
Yes, I may have faltered,

01:13:33.318 --> 01:13:36.987
but my heart has always
been in the right place.

01:13:36.988 --> 01:13:39.448
You have all seen
my true colours.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:42.993
But the person whose colours
you have not seen

01:13:42.994 --> 01:13:45.246
are my opponent's.

01:13:45.247 --> 01:13:48.207
While she may indeed
be colourful,

01:13:48.208 --> 01:13:50.167
I'll let you be the judge

01:13:50.168 --> 01:13:53.129
as to whether she has
been true or not.

01:13:55.632 --> 01:13:57.217
What is this?

01:13:57.218 --> 01:13:59.052
What are you doing?

01:14:03.265 --> 01:14:06.184
I guess I'm outsmarting
a con woman.

01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:10.854
It's show time!

01:14:17.571 --> 01:14:20.990
In the
peaceful town of Deanewood,

01:14:20.991 --> 01:14:24.159
there lived a man named Paul...

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:30.250
A mayor, a leader, an inspirer.

01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:33.336
The only thing more
reliable than his word

01:14:33.337 --> 01:14:36.338
was his chili cheeseburger.

01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:41.677
But every great hero
must be challenged by evil.

01:14:41.678 --> 01:14:45.472
This place won't even be a
town when I'm through with it.

01:14:45.473 --> 01:14:48.351
It'll just be another nook
of consumerism

01:14:48.352 --> 01:14:50.811
with Mogulburger as its king.

01:14:53.148 --> 01:14:54.565
This summer,

01:14:54.566 --> 01:14:58.068
will the princess of darkness
defeat our hero?

01:14:58.069 --> 01:15:00.196
You decide,
you decide, you decide.

01:15:23.053 --> 01:15:25.180
That's not fair.

01:15:27.349 --> 01:15:29.558
That's not true!

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:31.644
Hey, get off the stage!

01:15:38.526 --> 01:15:40.235
Boo!

01:15:40.236 --> 01:15:42.280
Boooo!

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:49.079
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:15:50.331 --> 01:15:53.207
That was amazing.

01:15:53.208 --> 01:15:56.251
How did you manage to do that?

01:15:56.252 --> 01:16:00.382
Well, let's just say we had
a little help from a friend.

01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:04.885
Well, if poll numbers
are any indication,

01:16:04.886 --> 01:16:07.305
this is gonna be a landslide.

01:16:09.099 --> 01:16:12.060
Congratulations, Mr.
Mayor. Thank you.

01:16:13.436 --> 01:16:15.312
This isn't over, Paul.

01:16:15.313 --> 01:16:18.400
Actually, I think it is.

01:16:24.823 --> 01:16:27.700
Hi.
Hi.

01:16:27.701 --> 01:16:30.411
That was really
impressive in there.

01:16:30.412 --> 01:16:32.705
Oh that?

01:16:32.706 --> 01:16:34.457
You saw that?

01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:35.958
Yeah.

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:37.751
Oh well, thanks.

01:16:37.752 --> 01:16:40.963
Mr. Mayor, do you have
a quote for the local paper?

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.091
I'll be right back.

01:16:47.429 --> 01:16:51.724
So, I guess you're here
to take your dog.

01:16:51.725 --> 01:16:55.395
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

01:16:55.396 --> 01:16:59.231
Well, could I just have
a moment with him

01:16:59.232 --> 01:17:02.025
to say goodbye.

01:17:02.026 --> 01:17:04.279
Of course.

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:15.789
I'm gonna get that robot!

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.377
Whoa!

01:17:23.549 --> 01:17:25.383
Well, pal,

01:17:25.384 --> 01:17:27.343
it's been great
getting to know you.

01:17:34.434 --> 01:17:36.393
Thank you...

01:17:36.394 --> 01:17:39.481
for being the best friend
a girl could ever have.

01:17:43.444 --> 01:17:45.445
Danger!
Danger! Danger! Archie?

01:17:45.446 --> 01:17:47.071
Danger!

01:17:48.406 --> 01:17:50.157
Ah ha-ha ha-ha!

01:17:50.158 --> 01:17:52.993
Whoa!

01:17:52.994 --> 01:17:55.370
Danger! Danger! Danger!

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:58.707
Archie!
Danger! Danger! Danger!

01:17:58.708 --> 01:18:00.626
Danger! Danger!
Danger!

01:18:12.473 --> 01:18:14.348
You're my best friend.

01:18:14.349 --> 01:18:17.351
I never really had a family.
You're my best friend.

01:18:17.352 --> 01:18:20.563
Until now.
You're my best friend.

01:18:20.564 --> 01:18:24.484
I never really had a family.
You're my best friend.

01:18:24.485 --> 01:18:26.068
Until now... till now.

01:18:33.535 --> 01:18:35.369
Archie, you did it!

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:43.043
Saved you...

01:18:43.044 --> 01:18:45.129
No!

01:18:46.465 --> 01:18:48.757
Huh? Wha? I didn't...

01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:50.927
Let's go.

01:18:53.596 --> 01:18:56.641
Archie, why did you do that?

01:18:56.642 --> 01:18:59.935
Not bad for
just a machine, huh?

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:02.437
That's not true.

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:05.275
You're not just a machine.

01:19:06.651 --> 01:19:09.487
You have a soul.

01:19:10.196 --> 01:19:13.116
The purest soul
of anyone I know.

01:19:31.259 --> 01:19:34.511
Am I alive or...
is this heaven?

01:19:34.512 --> 01:19:36.430
You're alive.

01:19:36.431 --> 01:19:38.015
Thanks to Brooke.

01:19:38.016 --> 01:19:40.518
Oh wow. It's so great
to see you guys.

01:19:40.519 --> 01:19:43.605
It's like being alive and being
in heaven at the same time.

01:19:44.397 --> 01:19:47.441
You did a really
brave thing, Archie.

01:19:47.442 --> 01:19:49.943
Well, I do have all kinds
of amazing talents.

01:19:49.944 --> 01:19:52.529
Yeah, so I've learned.

01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:54.448
Right.

01:19:54.449 --> 01:19:57.535
Hi, I'm Archie.
I'm not a normal dog.

01:19:57.536 --> 01:19:59.494
No kidding.

01:19:59.495 --> 01:20:03.583
Well, I guess you'll have
to take Archie home now.

01:20:03.584 --> 01:20:07.170
Yeah, yeah,
you're probably right.

01:20:08.922 --> 01:20:12.090
The thing is I think he is home.

01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:14.092
You really think so?

01:20:14.093 --> 01:20:16.011
I think Archie belongs here.

01:20:16.012 --> 01:20:17.554
Thank you.

01:20:17.555 --> 01:20:19.640
Aw, thanks, God.

01:20:19.641 --> 01:20:21.726
I-I mean, Mom.

01:20:21.727 --> 01:20:23.436
I mean Brooke.

01:20:24.228 --> 01:20:26.772
Are you sure this is okay?

01:20:26.773 --> 01:20:28.899
How could I say no?

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:31.193
You're the best, Uncle Paul.

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:33.613
Sorry, we'll ease into
the whole "uncle" thing.

01:20:33.614 --> 01:20:35.615
Sure.
Whoof!

01:20:35.616 --> 01:20:38.744
Well, I don't know about
you guys, but I'm a tad hungry.

01:20:45.917 --> 01:20:48.543
There you go.
That's pretty good.

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:52.089
Maybe you can talk to the boss
about getting me a job here.

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:54.299
Really?

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:58.929
Yeah. I was thinking maybe
I'd stick around for a while.

01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:01.264
It's a nice town.

01:21:01.265 --> 01:21:04.267
It'll be a nicer town
with you in it.

01:21:04.268 --> 01:21:08.397
I mean, um, someone with
your wealth of knowledge

01:21:08.398 --> 01:21:11.317
would be a valuable
asset to the town.

01:21:12.735 --> 01:21:14.738
You're cute.

01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:25.247
What?

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:28.458
Before the Lindsays
left tonight,

01:21:28.459 --> 01:21:31.378
I got some of Timmy's
farting powder

01:21:31.379 --> 01:21:35.091
and I may have spiked their
drinks with a double dose.

01:21:37.719 --> 01:21:39.761
What's happening?

01:21:39.762 --> 01:21:42.431
It hurts!

01:21:42.432 --> 01:21:45.017
This is your fault.
This is your fault!

01:21:45.018 --> 01:21:48.061
It was your idea.
I didn't do anything.

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:58.864
That's awesome.

01:21:58.865 --> 01:22:02.703
I figured they had it coming
after they were so mean to you.

01:22:08.583 --> 01:22:09.958
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:13.796
That was super dorky.

01:22:13.797 --> 01:22:16.674
You're making fun of me, right?

01:22:16.675 --> 01:22:18.341
Yep.

01:22:18.342 --> 01:22:20.219
Okay.

01:22:22.847 --> 01:22:25.058
Well, how about this?

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:37.110
Um, was that too dorky?

01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:40.031
No. Not at all.

01:22:48.122 --> 01:22:51.751
Look, I'm sorry things
didn't work out between us.

01:22:51.752 --> 01:22:54.878
I really did my best to
impress you, but...

01:22:54.879 --> 01:22:59.299
I guess the problems
of two little dogs don't amount

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.302
to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

01:23:04.514 --> 01:23:07.058
Aw, shucks!

01:23:21.697 --> 01:23:24.741
Hey, I didn't know
we opened this early.

01:23:24.742 --> 01:23:27.662
I would have been here
at this time every day.

01:23:28.913 --> 01:23:31.832
We've got burgers.
We've got fries.

01:23:31.833 --> 01:23:34.251
That should come as no surprise.

01:23:34.252 --> 01:23:37.087
We've got shakes
and onion rings.

01:23:37.088 --> 01:23:41.466

Oh, it worked all right.

01:28:18.119 --> 01:28:20.371
Perfect.

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.253
Take your money and get out.

01:28:28.254 --> 01:28:31.048
Yeah, sure. Thanks.
Heh heh heh!

01:28:31.049 --> 01:28:33.092
And hey, uh, listen.

01:28:33.093 --> 01:28:35.051
Sorry about that whole
other unfortunate incident.

01:28:35.052 --> 01:28:38.263
I was...
Shut up. Get out.

01:28:38.264 --> 01:28:40.266
Sure.
