WEBVTT

00:37.454 --> 00:39.873
I swear,
they get weirder every day.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.627
My mom and dad spent an entire weekend
shopping for decorative pillows.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.297
And they kept saying things
like "game-changer."

00:47.380 --> 00:48.965
-About pillows?
-Yeah.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.176
You should hear my dad
talk about solar panels.

00:51.259 --> 00:54.220
Ninety percent of his conversations
are about how much money they save him.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.848
He literally thanks the sun when it's out.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.225
I mean, are all parents this cringey?

00:59.309 --> 01:01.519
Jamie Shapiro's parents ride motorcycles.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.732
My dad's van uses vegetable oil,
so I just stopped letting him drop me off

01:05.815 --> 01:07.859
because kids said
that I smelled like French fries.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.152
I mean, you kind of do.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.745
I'm telling you, boys,
not only are Sasquatch real,

01:18.828 --> 01:20.413
but they're getting more sophisticated.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.831
-They're evolving.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.210
Now, I'm not just
talking about using tools, either.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.545
-I mean, really evolving.

01:27.629 --> 01:31.716
Some of them have even started
posting audio online.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.468
So Bigfoot has a podcast?

01:33.593 --> 01:36.262
Well, of course,
it's all subsidized by the government.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.223
They're using them
to get their message out.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.726
And why would the government
need Sasquatch to get its message out?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.270
I've already said too much.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.480
Okay.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.857
Hey, you boys want to see a pixie skull?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.527
-Yeah, I think we have to get going.
-Yeah.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.654
Jack. Ronald.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.075
Remember, boys.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.828
Trust no one.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.345
Of course, we got the solar panels
for the planet,

02:17.428 --> 02:19.430
but the real winner is my wallet.

02:20.014 --> 02:23.601
That buyback program, the power company
writes me a check every month, eh?

02:23.685 --> 02:26.813
Hey, here's looking at you, hot stuff.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.064
-Winning.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.274
That's right.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.692
How is that funny?

02:31.276 --> 02:32.735
-You want a burger? Fresh and real hot.
-Please.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.903
What's up, dawgs?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.447
You boys excited about our trip
to Keystone Lake next weekend?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.199
Yeah, actually,
the cabin looks pretty cool.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.534
Yeah, I can't wait to swim in that lake.

02:39.617 --> 02:43.037
I'm thinking about getting everyone
matching pajamas.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.331
-What? It's gonna be off the chizain!

02:46.499 --> 02:47.959
Oh, we're out of paper plates.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.294
Later, skaters.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.213
Matching pajamas?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.631
I know.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.467
Oh, is that my wife?

02:57.927 --> 02:58.928
Yowza!

03:00.180 --> 03:01.139
Stop it, you!

03:01.639 --> 03:03.349
Oh, stop looking so good and maybe I will.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.852
Hey, at least my parents don't flirt.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.228
Yeah, you're so lucky.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.105
-Howdy.
-There they are!

03:09.189 --> 03:10.273
Hi, hi!

03:10.356 --> 03:12.192
We heard the big news about the pillows.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.027
You'll have to show us later
at Game Night.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.862
That's right, Game Night's tonight.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.655
Is it at your house or mine this week?

03:17.739 --> 03:18.948
My house, I think.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.617
Okay. We'll take refuge here, then.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.785
What type of woodchips are you using?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.329
Wait, Dale, don't tell me.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.830
Hickory.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.250
-Pecan mesquite. I mixed it myself.
-Hey, oh!

03:29.334 --> 03:31.002
-He did.
-It's not me, right?

03:31.085 --> 03:33.254
-They're definitely getting worse.
-Hundred percent.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.132
Hey, uh, Jack.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.884
Why don't you come over here
and let your old man show you

03:37.967 --> 03:39.427
how to grill a flank steak, huh?

03:39.510 --> 03:41.012
Oh, um...

03:41.095 --> 03:43.389
Yeah, I actually was just about
to go do some stuff.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.766
-Yeah.
-I would love to, though.

03:44.849 --> 03:45.767
Maybe later, thanks!

03:51.981 --> 03:53.316
Howdy, broseph.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.275
What's up?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.402
Just, you know, saying hi.

03:56.819 --> 03:57.820
Can I come in?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.322
Yeah, sure.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.575
Hey, look at that.
Your Little League trophies.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.702
Man. You used to love baseball.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.538
You remember the time
we went to the Hall of Fame?

04:07.622 --> 04:10.792
Yeah. I mean, you, you got bit
by a snake at a rest stop.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.253
And then we spent the whole trip
at Cooperstown Hospital.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.588
We still had a blast. Got to admit.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.090
We should go back.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.341
Or go anywhere.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.260
Taking trips, you know. Me and you.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.722
Can I pop a squat?

04:26.516 --> 04:27.642
Look...

04:27.725 --> 04:29.644
I know you're not a little kid anymore,

04:29.727 --> 04:32.563
and it's natural for you
to pull away from your parents.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.148
But I wanna let you know...

04:34.983 --> 04:36.567
that I'll always be your dad.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.029
Okay, um, thanks, Dad.

04:40.113 --> 04:45.451
And if you ever wanna talk
about any changes in your body...

04:47.203 --> 04:49.372
Listen, I get it. It's, it's normal.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.874
I mean, we got the same parts, right?

04:52.917 --> 04:56.713
And I've been through it,
so I'm, I'm here for you.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.718
Thanks. Um, I'm gonna...

05:01.801 --> 05:02.844
Do your thing.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.637
Give me... Give me one of those.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.014
-Okay.
-All right.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.890
Okay, anyway.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.977
Hey, I love you.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.530
-Dude, you're kidding, right?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.949
My dad tried to have
the same talk with me.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.577
It was terrible, okay?
It ended with him kissing me on the lips.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.953
Seriously?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.204
To be fair, I did initiate it,

05:30.288 --> 05:31.414
but I panicked, okay?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.082
I just wanted out of that conversation.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.460
-Okay.
-They've been stressing me out so much,

05:35.543 --> 05:37.128
I broke out in a rash.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.130
Dude, really?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.717
-Me too.
-Is this puberty?

05:42.800 --> 05:43.885
I think it's Poison oak.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.429
Let's get ready for Game Night!

05:46.512 --> 05:49.807
Call us if you need us. Later, fools. Dab!

05:52.727 --> 05:54.771
She saw it on one of her mom vlogs.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.029
Just so you know,
I'm gonna kill you immediately,

06:03.112 --> 06:05.782
and then I'm gonna keep killing you
until you beg for mercy.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.410
You know you could kill other players
and give me a chance to get better.

06:09.994 --> 06:10.995
No.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.455
-Where's your headset?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.124
Aw, man. I left it at home.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.542
Sorry.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.002
Fine.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.799
Doesn't look like anybody's home.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.218
No, I see your mom and dad's shoes.
See, I don't get that.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.511
What's the point of having your own house

06:26.594 --> 06:28.179
if you're not even allowed
to wear shoes inside?

06:32.642 --> 06:33.726
What's that?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.978
-Is that your backyard?
-I don't know.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.106
Maybe they decided to watch
a movie or something.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.243
What kind of game is this?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.470
Jack?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.097
My coffee table's floating.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.306
Let's get out of here.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.938
What, are they witches or something?

07:19.021 --> 07:20.815
I don't know. They could be in a cult.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.859
Yeah, so what do we do?
Should we call the police?

07:22.942 --> 07:23.860
And tell them what?

07:23.943 --> 07:26.320
That our parents were in robes
and levitating furniture?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.365
We need to figure out
what's going on first.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.242
Right.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.452
How do we do that?

08:15.453 --> 08:17.121
-Whatcha doing, pal?

08:18.331 --> 08:21.667
Um, I was, I was just looking
for my fishing rod...

08:22.668 --> 08:24.420
...for the lake trip.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.967
It's in the garage.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.262
Oh, okay, thank you.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.100
Hey, you, uh, skipped breakfast
this morning.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.853
Is everything okay, son?

08:44.065 --> 08:46.484
Yeah, everything's fine.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.986
I just... just a little tired, you know.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.656
A changing body needs its rest, I guess.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.742
Little tadpole's losing his tail.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.161
Yes, yeah, exactly.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.622
That's me.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.540
Ribbit.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.542
Anyways, Dad,

09:02.625 --> 09:05.836
I, I have to go... meet Ronald.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.797
But thank, thank you.

09:09.048 --> 09:09.882
Okay.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.804
I knew it.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.223
So you recognize it?

09:18.432 --> 09:19.850
Unfortunately.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.728
Zugarians.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.689
What, what are Zugarians?

09:24.772 --> 09:26.190
Why "unfortunately"?

09:27.984 --> 09:29.068
Boys.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.616
There's no easy way to tell you this.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.245
Your parents are aliens.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.629
Come on.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.300
This town has been
a hotbed of alien activity for years.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.011
In the '80s,
they started abducting humans,

09:55.094 --> 09:56.596
replacing them with lookalikes...

09:57.305 --> 09:59.599
-Wait, so you're saying our parents--
-Sorry, kid.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.892
Chances are, your real parents
ended up as hors d'oeuvres

10:01.976 --> 10:03.477
on a Zugarian space cruiser.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.357
If they took our parents,
why wouldn't they take us?

10:08.441 --> 10:11.777
Because they, they take the parents first

10:11.861 --> 10:13.946
and they wait
for their offspring to mature.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.324
What do you mean, "mature?" Like...

10:16.782 --> 10:17.825
Like puberty?

10:17.908 --> 10:19.160
Exactly.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.289
How long have you had those?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.667
-Poison oak?
-That's not Poison oak.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.544
They're prepping your skin for extraction.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.921
-That's what these rashes are?
-Yeah.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.381
No, come on, that's nuts.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.009
Uh... My dad wears socks and sandals.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.844
What alien would do that?

10:36.927 --> 10:38.179
There's only one way to know.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.642
Get me a...

10:43.851 --> 10:45.519
A DNA sample.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.025
Strand of hair, fingernail clipping.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.236
Put it in the jar, bring it back here.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.946
Is this an old spaghetti sauce jar?

10:56.030 --> 10:57.239
In the meantime,

10:57.323 --> 10:59.700
I'll reach out to my network.
I'll see what I can do.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.618
Oh.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.708
You'll wanna wear these.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.003
Protect your thoughts.

11:14.548 --> 11:15.925
And remember...

11:16.008 --> 11:17.843
Zugarians are not to be trifled with.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.762
They are a paranoid species.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.682
If they sense you're onto them,
even for a second...

11:23.432 --> 11:25.393
You'll both be appetizers.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.253
I can't believe we're doing this.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.344
Oh.

12:43.804 --> 12:44.805
My rash is getting bigger.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.932
Probably just 'cause
you keep scratching it.

12:47.016 --> 12:47.892
Just leave it alone.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.059
Yours is getting worse, too.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.229
Yeah, well, I mean,
every time you scratch yours, it makes...

12:54.899 --> 12:55.816
Ronald.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.321
It's changing colors.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.157
-Does that mean they're aliens?
-No.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.409
It doesn't mean anything, okay?

13:05.493 --> 13:09.538
Look, it's an old tomato sauce jar
that we got from a guy named Crazy Chris.

13:10.539 --> 13:14.293
But if we really wanna know,
we have to go back.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.670
-Game night.
-Game night.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.637
Maybe they're just weird.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.264
I, I guess we could have imagined
the floating furniture.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.097
No, they're aliens.
They're definitely aliens!

14:20.901 --> 14:22.278
Hey, come on.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.530
Put your shoes on, we're leaving ASAP.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.448
For the lake?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.911
-The lake? That's today?
-Yeah.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.038
I, I need to call Ronald.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.582
It's too late for that now.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.669
The Gusbergs are already here.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.514
-Oh...

14:50.598 --> 14:52.349
-I know this one.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.852
-Turn it up!

14:55.436 --> 14:57.187
Keystone Lake, here we come!

15:02.568 --> 15:04.361
We gotta get out of here.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.738
Come on!

15:44.318 --> 15:45.194
You all good?

15:49.615 --> 15:51.033
Make sure you got everything.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.618
<i>You're in grave danger.</i>

15:52.701 --> 15:54.662
<i>Avoid being alone with them at all costs.</i>

15:54.745 --> 15:57.456
<i>They like to isolate their targets
before they strike.</i>

16:06.548 --> 16:08.926
Yeah, this... seems about right.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.056
-Pretty, huh?

16:15.891 --> 16:18.185
Yes, sir. Just us and the lake.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.563
Nothing around for miles and miles.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.483
Hey, would you look at that?

16:24.566 --> 16:26.443
The old boat's still here.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.989
We'll have to take you boys out
for a night cruise, huh?

16:30.072 --> 16:32.366
-Yeah, no, we're good.
-We're gonna go inside.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.625
What are we gonna do with them?

16:43.961 --> 16:45.337
Nothing.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.464
Just forget the map, let's just run.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.049
We're a million miles from anything.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.759
So? I saw this show
where this guy lived on nothing

16:50.843 --> 16:52.386
but, like, squirrel poop for six months.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.471
I... I've got a signal.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.392
Jack? Ronald?

16:59.226 --> 17:00.519
We're waiting...

17:01.103 --> 17:04.023
No screens at the lake.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.108
We're waiting for you out there.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.277
For what?

17:08.360 --> 17:09.862
-For Game Night.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.864
I thought, I thought
that was only for grown-ups.

17:11.947 --> 17:14.241
Well, we figured it's time
to let you join in on the fun.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.285
You're a couple of mature specimens now.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.454
Hey! Let's get this party started!

17:18.537 --> 17:19.872
Okay.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.373
We'll be there in a minute, Mom.

17:21.457 --> 17:25.627
Your hats are adorable, by the way,
but no hats at Game Night.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.425
Dude, they're gonna suck out
our brains like milkshakes.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.678
No, we'll get out of this, okay?
We'll find a way.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.638
I'll, I'll just grab the keys
when they're not looking.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.931
You don't know how to drive.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.601
Well, it feels like a good time to learn.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.365
-Did you put those in my bag?
-No, I thought you lost the...

17:55.866 --> 17:58.202
No, no, they're aliens.
They're definitely aliens!

18:02.331 --> 18:04.917
-They know we know.
-Just try to stay calm, okay?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.336
-My mom has tentacles.
-I know! So does mine.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.922
Hey, fellas! Before we get old!

18:10.005 --> 18:11.715
-Too late!

18:20.432 --> 18:21.475
So...

18:22.142 --> 18:23.602
how do we wanna do this?

18:23.685 --> 18:25.729
Well, six is too many for Pinochle.

18:25.813 --> 18:26.772
Canasta?

18:26.855 --> 18:27.940
Too complicated.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.900
I suppose it doesn't even
matter what we play...

18:30.984 --> 18:32.402
Then it's Crazy Eights.

18:32.986 --> 18:36.406
Throw the same number
or suit as the person before you.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.575
First one to get rid of their cards wins.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.244
Eights are wild.

18:40.327 --> 18:43.163
Maybe we're not ready for this yet.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.332
Don't worry, it won't hurt.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.046
-Wait, I forgot the knife.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.340
RON SR.
Oh, come on, the knife.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.758
-- We need the knife.
-RONALD'- We need it.

18:54.842 --> 18:58.220
Definitely want that knife.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.737
Oh, honey, that's way too big.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.989
It'll get the job done.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.790
Crazy Eights.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.041
Diamonds.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.631
Jack.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.841
Jack, it's your turn.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.093
Sweetie, what are you looking at?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.344
Nothing. Sorry.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.642
All right, let's see...

19:47.352 --> 19:49.813
Ronald, we can see your cards there, pal.

19:49.897 --> 19:50.898
Oh, come on. Turn...

19:51.565 --> 19:52.649
I know.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.401
Uh, it's a...

19:54.484 --> 19:55.903
...strategy.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.239
-Crazy Eights!

19:59.323 --> 20:00.782
-Look at you!

20:15.047 --> 20:16.381
Come on!

20:16.465 --> 20:17.716
Hurry up! Come on!

20:17.799 --> 20:18.884
I'm trying!

20:18.967 --> 20:20.761
Come on, come on! Hit the gas!

20:33.899 --> 20:35.108
Well, we tried.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.319
See you in the next life.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.785
Boys, boys!

20:44.868 --> 20:46.245
-- Hey!
-- Stop.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.913
-Guys, settle down!
-Ron, calm down.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.249
-Settle down!
-Stop pretending you're our parents!

20:50.332 --> 20:52.042
We know what you are.

20:52.709 --> 20:53.919
You took them, didn't you?

20:54.670 --> 20:55.796
Didn't you?

20:56.296 --> 20:58.799
My parents have terrible bodies.
Why would you even want them?

20:58.882 --> 21:00.050
-Ron.
-Hey.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.510
Guys, we are your parents.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.388
No, no, you're... you're like aliens.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.349
-Or alien witches or something.
-Yeah, we saw everything.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.686
The floating furniture, the head,
and those weird tentacle things.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.984
They're called florgs.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.945
And you've got them, too.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.990
No... No, you're aliens.

21:23.073 --> 21:26.034
We're... we're just people.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.202
We're nothing alike.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.454
I know it feels that way sometimes, but...

21:29.538 --> 21:31.623
For what it's worth,
we think you're weird, too.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.293
I'm not an alien.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.627
Not to us, you aren't.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.045
You're just our kids.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.006
No, no. What is happening?

21:39.089 --> 21:40.590
Am I an alien or not?

21:40.674 --> 21:41.675
Yes, son.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.260
We all are.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.935
You've, uh, you've had this
for a little while now, huh?

21:53.103 --> 21:55.480
It's your body's way
of letting us know that it's time.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.608
Oh, it's okay, everything's all right.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.112
This is nothing like Cooperstown.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.888
We wanted to tell you, honey.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.931
We just wanted to make sure
you were ready.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.184
Dude.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.644
Dude.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.939
I guess we really are like you.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.108
No... you're like you.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.776
And that's the way we like it.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.487
We love you.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.241
Love you, too.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.833
Well, I don't think we're getting
our security deposit back.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.876
-Nope.
-Come on, little doggies.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.169
-All right.
-Let's hustle.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.214
Which one's ours again?

23:45.715 --> 23:48.218
See that little speck near Orion's belt?

23:48.969 --> 23:49.928
I think so.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.055
That, my boys, is Zugaria.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.434
Let's go.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.361
So, what's it like?

24:06.987 --> 24:08.447
You'll have to see it for yourself.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.117
Wait, I... I thought
we were just driving home.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.702
We are.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.672
Here we go, boys.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.472
-Buckle up.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.042
See you around, boys.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.929
Hey, how about some tunes, huh?
