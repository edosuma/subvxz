<i>That's sick.</i>

01:17:50.398 --> 01:17:51.667
<i>I know a criminal.</i>

01:17:52.233 --> 01:17:53.398
BLAKE:
<i>It's a long story,</i>

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.567
<i>but it's actually not.</i>

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:56.201
- <i>It's really not a long story.</i>
- What?

01:17:56.203 --> 01:17:58.403
BLAKE: <i>So, apparently, I need
a licence to drive my moped.</i>

01:17:58.405 --> 01:17:59.772
JACOB: <i>Uh huh,
I didn't even know that.</i>

01:17:59.774 --> 01:18:01.107
BLAKE:
<i>No, neither did I.</i>

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.441
JACOB: <i>I thought you could
just drive 'em around.</i>

01:18:02.443 --> 01:18:03.541
BLAKE:
<i>No.</i>

01:18:03.543 --> 01:18:05.376
JACOB:
<i>What?</i>

01:18:05.378 --> 01:18:07.446
BLAKE: <i>So, that's something that
I'm going to have to deal with.</i>

01:18:07.448 --> 01:18:10.549
BLAKE VOICEOVER: <i>Each one of us has a
story of how we got to where we are,</i>

01:18:10.551 --> 01:18:13.085
<i>which most likely
involves study drugs,</i>

01:18:13.087 --> 01:18:14.553
<i>getting blackout drunk,</i>

01:18:14.555 --> 01:18:16.054
<i>and having one night stands.</i>

01:18:16.056 --> 01:18:18.590
<i>We'll tell these stories
at dinner parties</i>

01:18:18.592 --> 01:18:20.459
<i>and to our future children.</i>

01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:24.095
<i>Well, maybe not the
one night stand part.</i>

01:18:24.097 --> 01:18:25.630
<i>Or the blackout drunk part.</i>

01:18:25.632 --> 01:18:27.635
<i>Or the study drugs,
for that matter.</i>

01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:30.468
<i>But maybe our stories
don't have to be</i>

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:32.440
<i>for anyone but ourselves.</i>

01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:34.874
<i>Your hopeless romantic,</i>

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.976
<i>Blake Conway.</i>

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:39.980
