00:35.730 --> 00:41.580
An eternity ago, was our 
planet for its biggest challenge. 

00:41.854 --> 00:45.513
A Warlord called Piccolo, 
came from space ... 

00:45.546 --> 00:49.554
and brought darkness and chaos 
our peaceful world. 

00:49.587 --> 00:56.482
Assisted by Oozaru, brought the two 
the world on the brink of destruction. 

00:56.516 --> 00:59.418
Cities and countries were destroyed. 

00:59.452 --> 01:01.846
Many lives were lost. 

01:01.879 --> 01:08.398
But in the end were a number 
the brave warriors Mafubah. 

01:08.432 --> 01:12.986
A powerful association, which Piccolo deep 
underground prison was able to continue. 

01:14.722 --> 01:18.836
And now Master caught Saturday, 
Oozaru disappeared. 

01:18.869 --> 01:22.733
And the balance to our world 
slowly restored. 

01:22.767 --> 01:30.059
And that is thousands of years. 
Until now! 

01:34.934 --> 01:39.635
The first rule is that there are no rules. 

02:28.287 --> 02:31.837
The first to the ground loses. 

02:32.437 --> 02:35.325
Be ready for the dust to bite. 

03:37.983 --> 03:40.774
The superficial crane attack. 
You kicked it again. 

03:40.807 --> 03:43.585
It is quite difficult to do something 
block what I can not see. 

03:43.619 --> 03:48.465
Goku, you rely too much on 
your external observation. 

03:48.701 --> 03:53.900
Hear, see and feel is overestimated. 

03:54.798 --> 04:00.215
True strength comes from within. 
You Ki. 

04:01.420 --> 04:07.138
That is your best defense. 
And your best weapon. 

04:07.726 --> 04:10.500
Use your Ki. 

04:23.360 --> 04:27.469
Sorry Grandpa, I feel nothing. 
- Once Goku ... 

04:28.584 --> 04:30.236
Someday I will beat you. 

04:30.270 --> 04:34.462
Nice to see your friends tell you 
a 70-year-old man reports have. 

04:34.495 --> 04:38.901
What friends? 
At school, they are not even me. 

04:39.214 --> 04:42.549
You are special, Goku. 
- No, I'm different. 

04:42.582 --> 04:45.069
I know that, and it, too. 

04:45.103 --> 04:49.931
Sometimes they go so far, 
I might explode. 

04:50.250 --> 04:52.958
I would hand them a defeat. 

04:52.992 --> 04:55.849
I train you not to fight against boys. 
That you have promised. 

04:55.882 --> 04:57.789
I have promised not to fight. 

04:57.822 --> 05:02.375
Teach me something I can use. 
Teach me how I can get the girl. 

05:02.409 --> 05:06.286
Teach me to talk to her 
without me stumbling over my words. 

05:06.320 --> 05:11.731
Teach me to be normal. 
- Normal is also overestimated. 

05:12.036 --> 05:16.239
You must have confidence in yourself. 

05:19.897 --> 05:22.362
Goku ... 

05:24.190 --> 05:26.671
Congratulations. 

05:26.928 --> 05:29.302
You thought I forgot. 

05:29.336 --> 05:33.082
Suu-Shinchuu for you. 
- What is it? 

05:33.116 --> 05:37.352
A Drakenbal. 
It means' four stars'. 

05:37.385 --> 05:41.301
There are six of the world. 
From one to seven stars. 

05:41.335 --> 05:45.702
This, together with you the only 
valuable in my life. 

05:45.737 --> 05:48.439
What can it? 
- Only he does not ... 

05:48.569 --> 05:54.731
but if you do all seven, you 
they all want out. 

05:54.861 --> 05:58.872
So make sure you 're well preserved. 

05:59.518 --> 06:02.053
Thanks, Grandpa. 

06:31.692 --> 06:32.882
Fuller! 

06:33.935 --> 06:35.920
You have my bike demolished. 

06:35.954 --> 06:39.370
You let a fart, Agundus? 
I could have sworn I heard something. 

06:39.496 --> 06:41.778
Here you will pay, Fuller. 

06:45.673 --> 06:48.937
Shows Gekkie ... 

06:50.192 --> 06:53.357
Come on, Gekkie. 

06:53.525 --> 06:57.061
Here. 
Let see what you have in your house. 

07:01.150 --> 07:03.883
As I thought. Nothing. 

07:03.917 --> 07:07.524
Come on, Carey. 
Otherwise I'll be too late. 

07:08.384 --> 07:10.866
She waits for me. 

07:10.950 --> 07:12.848
All right, sweetheart? 

07:12.882 --> 07:15.421
He must almost cry. 
- What is wrong with you? 

08:17.131 --> 08:18.592
Everything is fine. 

09:19.499 --> 09:22.801
I 'm not. 

09:30.677 --> 09:32.613
On your knees! 

09:54.457 --> 09:59.705
This phenomenon is called the 
astrology a total solar eclipse. 

09:59.813 --> 10:05.445
In two weeks we have witnessed 
of this rare phenomenon. 

10:06.094 --> 10:10.666
What causes the eclipse? 
- Mr. Kinnery, Weaver? 

10:10.845 --> 10:14.969
Eclipse is caused by the 
moon light of the sun hold. 

10:15.063 --> 10:16.492
That is correct. 

10:16.526 --> 10:22.748
Since the dawn of civilization, this 
associated with the end of time. 

10:22.781 --> 10:28.477
In India, they think that a demon 
blocking the sunlight. 

10:28.511 --> 10:30.883
In China they believe that ... 

10:40.655 --> 10:44.695
Goku! 
- What is it? 

10:45.093 --> 10:49.257
What did our parents 
the next solar eclipse? 

10:51.016 --> 10:54.573
My grandfather would say that we 
must apply for Nemics. 

10:54.606 --> 10:55.849
Nemics? 

10:55.882 --> 10:59.751
Aliens that the Earth 
almost destroyed ... 

11:02.479 --> 11:05.021
2000 years ago. 

11:06.719 --> 11:09.640
Let's hope that 
not happen. 

11:13.383 --> 11:14.876
It Could. 

11:15.719 --> 11:19.114
Not again. I hate those things. 
They never do. 

11:19.148 --> 11:20.851
And you see my photo. 

11:20.884 --> 11:24.286
My essay is here. 

11:25.146 --> 11:26.529
I gotta go. 

11:38.559 --> 11:40.072
Damn! 

11:51.496 --> 11:53.181
Goku, right? 

11:56.716 --> 11:58.898
Did you know? 

11:59.658 --> 12:01.169
Yes. 

12:04.097 --> 12:05.912
You used your Ki. 

12:07.394 --> 12:09.359
Do you know that? 

12:09.545 --> 12:12.260
Chi Chi is because I would like to 
not say that I'm stupid. 

12:12.646 --> 12:15.511
There are plenty of stupid names. 

12:16.273 --> 12:20.575
I am not saying that it is a stupid name, 
only that it is not normal. 

12:21.266 --> 12:23.533
But normally overestimated ... 

12:23.567 --> 12:28.090
I am not saying that you will be overestimated. 
I stop now on. 

12:28.932 --> 12:32.105
I give a party tonight. 
- I make sure I get there. 

12:42.439 --> 12:44.596
Hi ... 

12:45.335 --> 12:47.478
Hi, Chi Chi ... 

12:48.766 --> 12:52.177
Goku, I fried chicken legs. 

12:52.211 --> 12:54.890
I could not find swans. 

12:55.239 --> 12:58.986
But the coach are more fantastic. 

13:10.579 --> 13:13.729
Beauty awaits. 

13:33.258 --> 13:37.714
Goku? Congratulations. 

13:41.940 --> 13:43.822
Goku? 

13:55.777 --> 13:57.696
Look. 

13:58.987 --> 14:02.284
What are you doing here, Gekkie? 
- I go to the party. 

14:04.444 --> 14:06.811
I am invited. 
I find no problems. 

14:06.844 --> 14:08.270
They have you already found. 

14:08.638 --> 14:13.904
Get out of here, 
and nobody knows that you have are. 

14:15.793 --> 14:18.014
Goodbye. 

14:20.387 --> 14:22.685
Later, loser. 

14:26.041 --> 14:28.262
I do not anymore. 

14:34.400 --> 14:37.570
I have promised not to fight. 
- What? 

14:38.184 --> 14:42.893
I have promised not to fight. 
- There is no fight. 

14:45.621 --> 14:47.733
But a massacre. 

14:49.225 --> 14:50.801
Mis. 

14:52.299 --> 14:54.073
Weather wrong. 

15:23.113 --> 15:25.932
My hand! 
- That fixed pain. 

15:26.257 --> 15:29.630
Chi Chi, thanks for the invitation. 

15:30.222 --> 15:34.169
Fuller? You guys. They left 
me see what they had in the house. 

15:35.752 --> 15:37.935
Nothing. 

15:40.357 --> 15:43.437
You are so dead. 
- No, Carey. 

15:45.851 --> 15:48.516
My car. 
- Nice blow. 

15:51.267 --> 15:52.827
Almost. 

15:57.620 --> 15:58.972
You are doing well. 

16:02.410 --> 16:04.255
Here, Fuller. 

16:07.404 --> 16:10.486
You have some dents in your car. 

16:32.911 --> 16:37.044
This you have never done, huh? 
- Yes, often enough. 

16:37.223 --> 16:38.730
In my mind. 

16:42.102 --> 16:43.685
You are different. 

16:45.345 --> 16:47.535
I like do. 

16:51.628 --> 16:56.162
It may be hard to believe, 
but we are similar. 

16:59.688 --> 17:02.354
This is my best birthday ever. 

17:02.508 --> 17:04.451
Are your birthday today? 

17:04.997 --> 17:06.786
Actually now. 

17:07.089 --> 17:11.398
My grandfather and I celebrate my birthday 
always at the same time. 

17:11.944 --> 17:14.342
Because of my great entrance. 

17:15.702 --> 17:17.234
What's happened to your parents? 

17:17.269 --> 17:21.413
I do not know. My grandfather would all 
explain if I would be eighteen. 

17:22.665 --> 17:24.556
And I am now eighteen. 

18:17.403 --> 18:19.133
Piccolo? 

18:19.602 --> 18:21.670
It is not here. 

18:27.566 --> 18:31.592
I will Drakenbal in charge. 

19:02.184 --> 19:04.312
There is something wrong. 

19:07.169 --> 19:09.837
There is something wrong with my grandfather. 
- What? 

19:09.871 --> 19:12.165
Excuse me, I gotta go. 

19:12.282 --> 19:14.694
Goku? 
- I talk to you later! 

19:23.072 --> 19:24.667
Grandpa. 

19:25.527 --> 19:29.098
Grandpa. 

19:54.661 --> 19:58.079
I get you out. 
- No, stay here with me. 

19:58.080 --> 20:02.578
There is not much time left. 
- Excuse me, Gramps, I was not here. 

20:02.579 --> 20:05.419
What happened? 
- Piccolo is back. 

20:05.420 --> 20:08.966
He is behind the Drakenbal to. 
He has come. 

20:11.278 --> 20:13.542
It has begun. 

20:18.454 --> 20:24.172
Search in Paozu Master Roshi, and tell him 
that Piccolo has come back. 

20:24.173 --> 20:27.455
For Piccolo of this world 
be banned ... 

20:27.455 --> 20:31.261
you must find the Dragon Balls, 
for Eclipse. 

20:31.262 --> 20:34.910
What? 
- There should be seven Dragon Balls found. 

20:34.911 --> 20:38.701
In the interest of all people 
we are obliged ... 

20:38.702 --> 20:41.336
Well, Grandpa. Keep now. 
You need rest. 

20:42.848 --> 20:47.577
Remember, you always have confidence ... 

20:47.578 --> 20:49.895
who you are. 

22:20.974 --> 22:22.915
Grandpa. 

22:45.045 --> 22:47.336
Where is it? 
I know that here. 

22:47.337 --> 22:49.921
Are you Piccolo? 
Did you kill my grandfather? 

22:49.922 --> 22:52.500
Listen idiot, when I was Piccolo, 
or what it is ... 

22:52.501 --> 22:55.059
I would not tell you. And if I 
your grandfather was killed ... 

22:55.060 --> 22:59.047
than I had now been shot. Anyone 
my 'promethium Orb' stolen ... 

22:59.047 --> 23:01.920
and I back. 
- What? 

23:03.280 --> 23:05.576
You got it. 

23:09.336 --> 23:12.114
Good movement, but I miss 
not again. 

23:12.115 --> 23:14.899
My father was called "promethium Orb ' 
20 years ago ... 

23:14.900 --> 23:17.843
and you've stolen from me last night. 
I'm not going without him. 

23:17.844 --> 23:21.865
I do not know where you are talking about. This is 
a Drakenbal Suu Shinchuu-, four-star ... 

23:21.865 --> 23:24.375
I promised my grandfather that I am safe 
would keep ... 

23:24.376 --> 23:27.224
so I let him take away one of mine. 
- Four stars? 

23:27.225 --> 23:29.307
Promethium Orb has five stars. 

23:29.308 --> 23:32.282
Who's the idiot? 
Look there now. 

23:37.510 --> 23:39.422
I can murder you. 

23:39.423 --> 23:41.728
You were not even in the neighborhood. 

23:43.139 --> 23:46.043
I knew it. There are others. 

23:46.044 --> 23:48.985
Seven to be exact. 
- What do you want for it? 

23:48.986 --> 23:50.694
It is not for sale. 

23:50.695 --> 23:52.632
Everyone has a price. 

23:52.633 --> 23:54.781
Not me. 

23:54.782 --> 23:56.670
What is wrong with you Drakenbal happened? 

23:57.705 --> 23:59.830
Last night, a thief broke 
in my father's company. 

23:59.831 --> 24:02.426
"Capsule Corporation. 
Someone hacked the vault ... 

24:02.427 --> 24:04.499
the guards killed, 
and Drakenbal stolen. 

24:11.542 --> 24:13.501
I lost my father swore that 
I would get back. 

24:13.501 --> 24:16.781
I followed the signal to go here, 
and when I came to you. 

24:17.995 --> 24:21.098
He I am sorry that I have shot you, I 
thought you was a murderous thief. 

24:21.098 --> 24:23.311
As if you can shoot so well. 

24:23.312 --> 24:26.697
How you knew that I had Drakenbal. 
- I have a small machinetje invented. 

24:26.698 --> 24:30.996
This can detect and locate signals 
the Drakenbal broadcasts. 

24:30.997 --> 24:33.014
See? 

24:33.015 --> 24:36.352
Do you have a Drakenbal Energy 
Lokaliseerder 'made? 

24:36.998 --> 24:40.191
Cool. 
- Drakenbal Energy. D.B.E. 

24:40.192 --> 24:42.794
Catchy name. 
- Then you are a scientist. 

24:42.795 --> 24:44.690
A degree in applied dynamics. 

24:44.691 --> 24:46.453
With a 'minor' in tactical weapons. 

24:46.454 --> 24:49.189
I am close to a breakthrough. 
I can feel it. 

24:49.190 --> 24:51.760
The Ki, the other Dragon Balls are. 
I must have them all. 

24:51.761 --> 24:54.998
What do you now that Dragon Ball? 
- That will make me famous. 

24:54.998 --> 24:57.639
Ga I have an infinite source 
energy from them. 

24:58.303 --> 25:00.359
Good luck with that. 

25:04.581 --> 25:06.775
I'm Goku. 

25:06.776 --> 25:09.114
Maybe we can help each other. 

25:09.115 --> 25:12.038
I have one Master Roshi find 
in Paozu. 

25:12.072 --> 25:13.936
If you go to that brings me, help 
I you to find the Dragon Balls. 

25:13.937 --> 25:16.038
I D.B.E., why would 
I need you? 

25:16.039 --> 25:19.165
There is clearly someone else also 
looking after them. 

25:19.166 --> 25:22.787
And you, you may need strengthening. 

25:28.642 --> 25:31.393
Bulma Briefs. 

25:38.211 --> 25:40.663
What is your ... 

25:42.605 --> 25:44.608
An elevator? 

25:47.159 --> 25:48.678
Cool. 

26:09.296 --> 26:11.712
File information is downloaded. 

26:11.713 --> 26:15.201
I took every possible spelling of 
Roshi tried in the file. 

26:15.202 --> 26:17.681
He is not listed. 
- Did you 'Master' tried? 

26:19.492 --> 26:22.918
M E E S. .. 
- Idiot. 

26:22.919 --> 26:25.305
Are you sure you do not want to? 

26:30.634 --> 26:32.636
He is here. 

26:32.637 --> 26:34.616
How do you know? 

26:34.617 --> 26:37.134
I can always find my grandfather. 

26:40.651 --> 26:44.411
I know that he no longer is, but 
I get the same feeling. 

26:47.851 --> 26:50.394
There is another Drakenbal. 
Let's go. 

27:04.015 --> 27:06.061
Bulma, wait. 

27:09.024 --> 27:12.754
Bulma, wait. You can not just 
in breaking someone's house. 

27:12.755 --> 27:16.442
We do not break in, the door 
is not locked. 

27:16.813 --> 27:19.483
Well, this girl loses control. 

28:05.733 --> 28:07.476
Thief. 

28:12.248 --> 28:15.123
This is not what you ... 

28:21.420 --> 28:24.589
This does not happen. 
- Let it crook. 

28:25.107 --> 28:28.524
You get your clock, thief. 

28:50.655 --> 28:52.941
You are well trained. 

29:04.148 --> 29:07.047
Stop. You need to stop. 

29:07.048 --> 29:10.128
Now I will put an end to it. 

29:22.428 --> 29:24.257
Sorry. 

29:24.258 --> 29:25.846
Superficial crane attack. 

29:25.847 --> 29:28.034
They recognize me everywhere. 

29:29.987 --> 29:31.873
How is it Gohan? 

29:31.874 --> 29:34.756
Did you know my grandfather? 
- Or I knew him? 

29:34.757 --> 29:36.792
I got him trained. 

29:39.292 --> 29:43.297
You are Master Roshi. 
- I'm Muten Roshi. 

29:43.298 --> 29:46.354
The unbeatable. 

29:48.143 --> 29:50.758
My grandfather is dead. 

29:52.300 --> 29:56.103
He was murdered. I will avenge him. 

29:57.326 --> 30:01.138
But before he died 
He ... 

30:01.139 --> 30:04.358
asked me to find you, and you 
to say that ... 

30:04.359 --> 30:08.027
Piccolo is back. And you 
but we knew what to do. 

30:08.028 --> 30:10.866
He has told me a poem. 

30:10.867 --> 30:16.010
It was called "Seven Dragon Balls." 
- Seven Dragon Balls ... 

30:16.011 --> 30:19.916
must be found for 
the confidence of all people. 

30:19.917 --> 30:21.992
We will be linked ... 

30:21.992 --> 30:25.529
improved forces of theft 
and anxiety. 

30:25.530 --> 30:29.467
And forcing Shenlong to appear. 

30:29.468 --> 30:33.720
It was a nursery rhyme. To us 
by old masters. 

30:33.721 --> 30:37.440
Then you probably also know that we 
must find the Dragon Balls for the Eclipse. 

30:37.441 --> 30:41.027
Eclipse. 
- Do you have a Drakenbal? 

30:49.395 --> 30:50.995
Bikini Quarterly? 

30:52.670 --> 30:55.447
This is a publication for collectors. 

31:38.807 --> 31:41.778
If the prediction is true ... 

31:41.779 --> 31:47.496
will have seven days the sun obscuring 
by the blood Monday 

31:47.497 --> 31:50.193
This will be the beginning of the apocalypse are. 

31:50.194 --> 31:52.732
Roshi do not be silly. 
You said it yourself. 

31:52.733 --> 31:55.748
It is a nursery rhyme. 
- Yes, for tonight ... 

31:55.749 --> 31:59.707
I understood nothing of. 
But finally ... 

31:59.708 --> 32:04.077
I can see. You are Ki, 
in one way or another. 

32:04.110 --> 32:07.004
Gohan knew. 
So he trained you. 

32:07.005 --> 32:10.155
Well, Goku, this is been great. 
You have your Master Roshi found ... 

32:10.156 --> 32:12.639
I got me my part of the agreement 
account, now it's time for yours. 

32:12.640 --> 32:14.990
Let's go. 
- If that what Gohan says is true ... 

32:14.991 --> 32:17.435
and Piccolo is here ... 

32:17.435 --> 32:21.522
this is perhaps the only hope 
that our world can survive. 

32:22.965 --> 32:24.862
We go. 

32:26.010 --> 32:28.324
But we go together. 

33:14.018 --> 33:15.818
I will bring you to 
a secret place. 

33:15.819 --> 33:19.316
Where a few selected energy 
of the three elements will master. 

33:19.317 --> 33:21.713
Air, fire and water. 

33:21.714 --> 33:25.398
Superficial crane attack is the most 
fundamental techniques of the Air Master. 

33:25.399 --> 33:28.824
I will you have to learn. 
You should use it. 

33:30.461 --> 33:34.066
You wanted him. Although I value 
the fun start to appreciate. 

33:34.066 --> 33:36.422
Well. 

33:39.562 --> 33:42.442
Leave your hand there for a second seat, 
and you'll lose him. 

33:42.443 --> 33:44.591
Let's go. 

34:11.920 --> 34:16.367
The stone temple was already millennia the soul 
of loneliness and lighting. 

34:16.368 --> 34:20.199
Here you learn what I learned 
of the old masters. 

34:24.543 --> 34:26.630
I thought you had said that 
this place was sacred? 

34:41.956 --> 34:44.161
Hello, Goku. What are you doing here? 

34:44.163 --> 34:46.320
I wanted you the same questions. 

34:48.237 --> 34:50.500
Are you with me? 
- Yes. 

34:50.899 --> 34:53.936
Here comes everybody train 
for the great San Toi tournament. 

34:53.937 --> 34:57.036
I wanted you at the party 
though. 

34:57.038 --> 34:59.008
Before you suddenly left. 

34:59.009 --> 35:01.480
I have heard of your grandfather 
his accident. 

35:01.481 --> 35:03.941
Excuse me. 

35:03.942 --> 35:06.790
The house had collapsed? 

35:06.791 --> 35:09.050
Yes, something. 

35:09.051 --> 35:11.468
What would you tell me? 

35:12.880 --> 35:16.192
Nobody at home knows this, but I 
am also a fighter. 

35:16.880 --> 35:19.612
They would not understand. 

35:20.504 --> 35:23.111
Goku, let's go. 

35:24.114 --> 35:26.636
I gotta go. 

35:27.156 --> 35:29.090
Come to the San Toi tournament. 

35:29.091 --> 35:31.735
Maybe we can find time 
to fight. 

35:37.455 --> 35:40.695
We can not train. 
My Ki verschrompelt. 

35:41.574 --> 35:44.960
At least a total waste. 
I got a signal from the Drakenbal. 

35:44.961 --> 35:46.707
Let's go. 

35:56.395 --> 35:58.205
Now! A hand. 

35:58.206 --> 36:01.990
For the second level of Air Master ... 

36:01.991 --> 36:04.433
you need two things 
under control. 

36:06.791 --> 36:08.780
Save this orange of my hand. 

36:17.550 --> 36:21.023
I get a strong signal of a Drakenbal, 
it is only 3 miles away. 

36:36.590 --> 36:38.514
Sorry. 

36:39.800 --> 36:42.673
What happened? 
Hole that appeared out of nowhere. 

36:46.912 --> 36:49.052
Do you need help 
down there? 

36:50.686 --> 36:52.410
Let me handle this. 

36:53.942 --> 36:56.035
You're a real life saver. 

36:56.036 --> 36:58.159
We are stuck down here. 

36:58.160 --> 37:03.005
I would be so grateful if you and me 
my friends here could get. 

37:05.398 --> 37:08.577
For such a beautiful thing as you, 
no problem. 

37:09.046 --> 37:11.150
Thank you. 

37:11.151 --> 37:14.419
You are a true gentleman. 
- Yamcha, to your service. 

37:14.922 --> 37:17.960
I have payment required. 
- Payment. 

37:18.532 --> 37:20.958
Who do you think that this fall has made? 

37:20.959 --> 37:25.005
Wait, I see it 
a 55 Roadster Orange? 

37:25.006 --> 37:27.019
That I did. 

37:27.020 --> 37:29.171
You're nothing but a 
cowardly bandit. 

37:29.172 --> 37:31.602
Yes, but one with a ladder. 

37:31.603 --> 37:35.671
Think about it. Because when the sun rises, 
will be hot. 

37:45.786 --> 37:48.091
What we now need 
are marshmallows and ghost story. 

37:48.092 --> 37:50.060
We do not have marshmallows. 

37:50.061 --> 37:52.128
But I do have a story. 

37:52.129 --> 37:55.662
2000 years ago, the earth 
almost destroyed. 

37:55.663 --> 37:58.510
Not people, but 
Gods from the sky. 

38:03.736 --> 38:07.389
They called Piccolo and Oozaru. 

38:08.838 --> 38:11.861
Seven mysticuszen fought 
together intruders. 

38:11.862 --> 38:16.011
They sacrificed their lives 
to Mafuba fluctuations. 

38:16.012 --> 38:19.200
A powerful curse that Piccolo 
enlarged. 

38:20.345 --> 38:23.961
Piccolo is now in one way or another 
escaped. 

38:23.962 --> 38:27.787
In two days, the moon 
darken the sun. 

38:27.788 --> 38:30.129
And that will Oozaru products. 

38:32.521 --> 38:33.979
To Piccolo to stop! 

38:33.980 --> 38:36.370
Who gets it all together 
seven Dragon Balls to collect ... 

38:36.371 --> 38:38.836
will obtain the power of Shenlong. 

38:38.837 --> 38:41.003
This entitles you to a perfect wish. 

38:43.859 --> 38:45.539
Unless we find the Dragon Balls ... 

38:45.540 --> 38:48.764
and our desire to Piccolo 
of the world banned ... 

38:48.932 --> 38:52.350
otherwise we will not defend 
voted against the Warlord. 

38:52.350 --> 38:56.096
What a nonsense! 
Do you expect that I believe? 

38:56.097 --> 39:00.671
No, I do not expect, you are the type 
that not all believe. 

39:01.059 --> 39:03.490
I pity you! 
- Well what can I care. 

39:03.491 --> 39:07.206
I'm not in that hole fixed. 
- Let us out now! 

39:09.260 --> 39:13.032
Slow down when jumping. 
Another action, and I'm outta here. 

39:16.358 --> 39:18.164
The Drakenbal is near! 

39:18.165 --> 39:20.767
I think it is somewhere under the ground 
buried. 

39:24.773 --> 39:27.254
Enough games! 
We have no time to lose. 

39:27.288 --> 39:28.172
Let it just come down. 

39:28.173 --> 39:32.248
We have what tools are needed 
for us to dig. 

39:35.706 --> 39:38.717
What would you say to find more money 
earn what you could ever have dreams? 

39:38.718 --> 39:40.449
Now you start to draw my attention! 

39:43.751 --> 39:47.015
If the television is similar, then 
everything you're looking for here! 

39:47.016 --> 39:48.251
Let us begin, come on! 

39:52.933 --> 39:56.281
You have no right to the royalties 
of my invention to give away. 

39:56.282 --> 39:58.686
One day, the Dragon Balls 
prevail over the world. 

39:58.687 --> 40:01.636
Do not worry, 
if you have zero ... 

40:01.637 --> 40:04.104
is still zero. 

40:15.034 --> 40:19.421
If they had not followed, then 
Drakenbal we had not found. 

40:19.422 --> 40:22.848
Everything happens for a reason, buddy! 

40:22.882 --> 40:26.432
That I have the day television. 

40:39.306 --> 40:41.030
The Drakenbal is near. 

40:41.031 --> 40:44.453
Be on your guard, Piccolo 
is also looking for the Drakenbal. 

40:47.043 --> 40:49.710
I'm Master Roshi followed 
as assigned. 

40:49.711 --> 40:52.391
He trains the boy, 
Sangoku. 

40:52.392 --> 40:55.436
I can prevent! 

40:58.190 --> 41:02.506
No, there will be more than just 
hinder require. 

41:08.917 --> 41:11.261
Your blood is the life. 

41:26.051 --> 41:29.722
The dragon balls are within easy reach ... 

41:29.723 --> 41:35.096
while the strength for this world 
destroy. 

41:42.864 --> 41:45.706
But if we once 
the seven dragon balls have ... 

41:45.707 --> 41:47.674
how soon will I see results? 

41:47.675 --> 41:51.169
One month, one year? 

41:54.264 --> 41:57.224
High temperatures tampering with the signal, 
I can get him sharp. 

42:08.860 --> 42:12.240
Left and right, 
I just burnt my balls. 

42:15.233 --> 42:17.138
But I see him! 

42:17.139 --> 42:20.564
Now we must see how we 
come over. 

42:29.610 --> 42:30.570
Goku, be careful! 

42:42.936 --> 42:43.862
Ga! 

42:57.140 --> 42:59.792
They should be in the lava, to 
we do not stop. 

43:14.641 --> 43:17.112
What are you doing? 
- I make a bridge. 

43:30.636 --> 43:32.032
Impressive. 

44:18.629 --> 44:23.048
The power to prevent this, 
comes from inside you! 

44:46.269 --> 44:49.772
Master Roshi! 
The Dragon Ball ... 

44:49.773 --> 44:52.247
They speak to you? 
- Yes. 

44:52.248 --> 44:53.933
They let you see our future. 

44:53.934 --> 44:58.592
There is a Demon ... 
- O0zaru, the destroyer. 

44:58.593 --> 45:03.430
He will murder you and Bulma ... 

45:03.430 --> 45:08.112
Yamcha and he will destroy everything. 

45:09.168 --> 45:11.973
The future is constantly changing. 

45:11.974 --> 45:15.053
Let the dragon you learn the lessons. 

45:17.999 --> 45:21.003
I must therefore, in one way or another 
Oozaru beat. 

45:33.542 --> 45:36.446
The eclipse is over 2 days, we will 
the other Dragon Balls are never on time. 

45:36.447 --> 45:38.849
There is also another way to Piccolo. 
to stop ... 

45:38.850 --> 45:41.835
the only chance the world 
still has ... 

45:41.836 --> 45:45.174
in Toi San. 

45:46.279 --> 45:49.831
Toi San. 

46:21.906 --> 46:23.190
Roshi ... 

46:23.191 --> 46:25.641
How are my favorite 
skeptic. 

46:27.598 --> 46:30.187
I'll apologize, 
Sifu Norris. 

46:30.188 --> 46:33.346
Everything that I have to have doubts ... 

46:33.346 --> 46:38.967
I know now that everything is true. 

46:41.585 --> 46:42.752
The prediction. 

46:42.753 --> 46:46.287
The blood will be Monday morning the sun 
dim. 

46:51.231 --> 46:52.714
I need your help. 

46:52.715 --> 46:55.279
I have another power source needed. 

46:55.280 --> 47:00.618
The Mafuba? 
This will include all your life forces. 

47:00.619 --> 47:03.446
If you put it that way, it is a 
plan doomed to failure. 

47:03.446 --> 47:06.777
But the boy will still not ready. 

47:06.778 --> 47:10.704
It is the only way ... 

47:10.705 --> 47:12.670
and I am the only one who can. 

47:15.609 --> 47:18.467
We will be ready, 
tomorrow. 

47:18.468 --> 47:21.210
Námešt. 

47:47.400 --> 47:49.989
Why do you do in a tournament 
if you do not fight? 

48:03.773 --> 48:07.002
You got it. 
- Yes. What is this? 

48:07.003 --> 48:09.930
Are you all right? 
- Yes, I'm fine. 

48:09.931 --> 48:12.538
Do you join the tournament? 
- No, I'm here for something else. 

48:12.539 --> 48:14.795
Something more important than me? 

48:16.137 --> 48:19.127
You are one of the reasons 
why it is so important. 

48:21.404 --> 48:23.431
I must confess something. 

48:23.432 --> 48:26.617
I wanted to be famous. 
- I was rich. 

48:26.618 --> 48:29.493
None of us will get what 
he wanted. 

48:33.627 --> 48:35.711
Look at these people. 

48:35.712 --> 48:37.680
They have no idea. 

48:37.681 --> 48:40.568
Yes, I wished that I myself did not know. 

48:43.342 --> 48:45.726
Never thought that I liked 
for a thief to talk. 

48:47.529 --> 48:51.647
You know, I'm not so bad 
if you know me once. 

48:52.863 --> 48:55.236
Maybe I do love bad men.

48:59.019 --> 49:01.471
That is good to know, the day 
before the world ends. 

49:11.253 --> 49:13.653
We have our Dragon Ball still. 

49:13.654 --> 49:17.017
That's right. Piccolo she needed all seven. 

49:17.018 --> 49:18.889
He may also wish not. 

49:18.890 --> 49:21.220
That means that you still 
your 30 percent do. 

49:21.221 --> 49:23.527
33 and third. 

49:23.528 --> 49:25.401
Do not exaggerate. 

49:52.373 --> 49:54.928
The final level of 
Air Master technique ... 

49:54.928 --> 49:57.063
is the 'Kamehameha'. 

49:57.097 --> 49:59.377
Yeah, my grandfather told about ... 

49:59.378 --> 50:01.466
but he said that I have not done 
for washing with which to learn. 

50:01.945 --> 50:05.956
You have not. 
But there is not much time. 

50:07.016 --> 50:08.937
For the 'Kamehameha' 
control ... 

50:08.938 --> 50:11.431
should you manage Ki. 

50:11.431 --> 50:13.947
Pull the power from the universe. 

50:23.650 --> 50:26.378
Let you go by. 

50:42.639 --> 50:44.334
Concentrate the. 

50:44.367 --> 50:46.979
And let Friday 

50:47.851 --> 50:50.534
What? 

50:52.179 --> 50:54.659
The more you 
in the 'Kamehameha' explains ... 

50:54.660 --> 50:57.364
the greater the force. 
Practice ... 

50:57.365 --> 51:00.990
cross the torches in the courtyard to. 
See you tomorrow morning. 

51:46.504 --> 51:48.328
That is cheating. 

51:48.727 --> 51:51.451
You have the torch lighting 
your Ki. 

51:52.046 --> 51:54.048
Did you see me stand? 

51:54.587 --> 51:57.552
Then you know I think, 
why should I cheat. 

52:02.960 --> 52:06.728
You know, my grandfather always said, 
the control over my Ki to get ... 

52:06.729 --> 52:09.318
I have one with me ... 

52:09.319 --> 52:11.406
and my enemy. 

52:11.407 --> 52:13.708
I still do not know 
what that means. 

52:13.709 --> 52:16.325
Maybe you need a boost. 

52:17.103 --> 52:21.058
There are five non flaming torches 
in the courtyard. 

52:21.059 --> 52:23.754
You are five steps away from me. 

52:23.755 --> 52:25.642
Every time you have a torch lights ... 

52:25.738 --> 52:28.845
can you step to me do. 

52:30.067 --> 52:32.024
What happens if I 
all five torches have been lit? 

52:33.174 --> 52:35.736
Then you stand next to me. 

52:36.904 --> 52:38.924
Where I can touch you. 

52:39.272 --> 52:41.608
That is good. 

52:47.473 --> 52:49.210
Very impressive. 

52:49.767 --> 52:51.728
Yes. 

52:59.376 --> 53:01.027
Not bad. 

53:07.540 --> 53:09.344
Okay. 

53:21.236 --> 53:23.854
Take a step back. 
- That was not the rule. 

53:23.855 --> 53:26.030
My game, my rules. 

53:30.301 --> 53:32.950
Three, focus. 

53:38.262 --> 53:40.858
It does not feel good, 
I'm missing something. 

53:40.859 --> 53:42.813
You have every movement, 
that you make. 

53:45.052 --> 53:47.050
You can do this. 

54:06.029 --> 54:11.111
I think the next move, 
to extinguish the lights should be. 

55:01.681 --> 55:03.494
Stop it! 

55:07.489 --> 55:09.172
Chi-chi? 

55:10.668 --> 55:13.681
Excuse me, 
I wanted no one to wake you. 

55:14.294 --> 55:18.318
No, excuse me. 
Do more. 

55:18.941 --> 55:21.156
No, I was just leaving. 

55:23.269 --> 55:26.138
What are you doing here? 
- Nothing. 

55:29.397 --> 55:31.455
There is no curfew in this temple? 

55:31.456 --> 55:33.088
Goodnight. 

55:36.340 --> 55:39.354
That I had not thought of Goku. 
- It is always the quiet guys. 

55:41.441 --> 55:43.048
Hey, you are late. 

55:43.635 --> 55:44.998
Saturday you not in your room? 

55:46.539 --> 55:48.345
She has the Dragon Balls. 

56:06.350 --> 56:07.992
Who are you? 

56:18.588 --> 56:20.595
We are looking for another way. 

56:26.749 --> 56:28.611
Chi-chi? 

56:48.475 --> 56:50.300
Help me, Goku. 

56:53.508 --> 56:55.141
Goku, stop. 

56:58.666 --> 57:01.891
Oh, damn ... 
- Wrong. 

57:22.624 --> 57:24.094
Are you okay? 

57:25.884 --> 57:28.381
He is alive, 
but only barely. 

57:54.107 --> 57:55.642
Opa! 

57:55.643 --> 57:57.603
I'm so glad I see you. 

58:02.447 --> 58:05.299
Wait, are you here for me? 

58:05.299 --> 58:09.188
It is not your time, Goku. 
There is much to do. 

58:11.981 --> 58:16.128
Grandpa, how I beat Oozaru? 

58:16.129 --> 58:20.511
Have always confident in who you are. 

58:32.200 --> 58:33.948
Confidence is good. 

58:43.807 --> 58:47.556
We are too late. 
They have all seven. 

58:47.557 --> 58:49.438
Dragons Temple? 

58:50.066 --> 58:53.176
Thus, he calls Shenlong. 

59:08.417 --> 59:10.121
The spells are widely. 

59:10.122 --> 59:12.658
Pray that's enough 
Piccolo to manage. 

59:13.443 --> 59:15.341
Good luck, my friend. 

59:15.342 --> 59:16.774
Namaste. 

59:26.475 --> 59:28.108
We see each other again ... 

59:28.109 --> 59:30.512
on the other side. 

59:39.550 --> 59:41.536
Where are we going? 
- Dragons Temple. 

59:41.537 --> 59:43.659
We need to get, 
for embezzlement. 

59:45.214 --> 59:49.549
Imagine, 
so as to be chained. 

59:50.156 --> 59:54.216
With every fiber in your body, 
still small. 

59:54.819 --> 59:57.037
However ... 

01:00:00.228 --> 01:00:05.605
that was my hell ... 
for 2000 years. 

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.434
This Drakenbal ... 

01:00:12.435 --> 01:00:16.899
I take my revenge 
on earth. 

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.071
Come on, faster! 

01:00:49.615 --> 01:00:53.721
You make no impression on me. 
- I will make you ever afraid. 

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:11.965
I must stop him, 
before he makes his wish. 

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:32.633
I lost control. 

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:33.029
I'm glad you accompany me. 
Witness my glory ... 

01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:37.436
as I have forces me to Shenlong 
to give order to prevail on this stone. 

01:02:37.437 --> 01:02:41.744
I will Oozaru reports 
and destroy you here. 

01:02:42.204 --> 01:02:44.564
Oozaru reports? 

01:02:45.642 --> 01:02:48.035
When the blood Monday obscuring the sun ... 

01:02:49.037 --> 01:02:52.006
will you be Oozaru. 
- What? 

01:02:52.454 --> 01:02:54.799
No. 
- There is no denying to. 

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.907
Goku's time is over. 

01:03:07.427 --> 01:03:09.133
No! 

01:03:09.379 --> 01:03:11.848
Goku is a cover. 

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:15.098
This is who you are. 

01:03:17.802 --> 01:03:22.189
You came from a meteor, 
hidden among the people to your 18e. 

01:03:22.541 --> 01:03:26.011
This is the place where you landed. 
Where you will be reborn. 

01:03:26.732 --> 01:03:30.304
You should be me! 

01:03:35.737 --> 01:03:38.536
Goku, no! 
- He understands us more. 

01:03:46.485 --> 01:03:49.724
They have a Drakenbal. 
Bring it to me. 

01:04:11.861 --> 01:04:13.801
What? 

01:04:14.424 --> 01:04:15.643
Ga. 

01:04:21.444 --> 01:04:23.030
No. 
- Go! 

01:04:51.538 --> 01:04:53.467
Let me help you. 

01:04:55.301 --> 01:04:57.596
Too late. 

01:05:02.348 --> 01:05:04.837
Protect the Drakenbal. 

01:05:12.859 --> 01:05:17.682
Oozaru can provide 
no reports. 

01:05:17.683 --> 01:05:22.147
Only with faith, 
you can win. 

01:05:24.823 --> 01:05:30.757
Let the Oozaru Goku 
in you not destroy. 

01:05:54.691 --> 01:05:58.168
Always Believe in who you are. 

01:05:58.169 --> 01:05:59.143
No! 

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.791
You have every movement, 
that you make. 

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:03.137
You are special, Goku. 

01:06:10.234 --> 01:06:14.050
Impossible. 
- Something that my grandfather taught me. 

01:06:14.759 --> 01:06:17.911
First rule, 
that there are no rules. 

01:07:16.872 --> 01:07:18.133
Wait. 

01:07:21.213 --> 01:07:23.018
Take it. 

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.108
The Drakenbal is mine. 

01:07:50.007 --> 01:07:53.664
I was fully under control. 

01:08:02.043 --> 01:08:04.794
I'm Goku. 

01:08:05.692 --> 01:08:08.975
I am Oozaru. 

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:12.540
To be with myself, 
I have two. 

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:30.219
I must have confidence in who I am. 

01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:37.687
People Forces ... 

01:08:37.688 --> 01:08:40.140
have already failed. 

01:09:38.246 --> 01:09:40.890
I wish that it 
not need to be. 

01:09:56.422 --> 01:09:59.130
A wish is granted. 

01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:07.230
Dragon! 

01:10:07.231 --> 01:10:11.100
The test of the seven had been fulfilled! 

01:10:11.485 --> 01:10:15.050
I am obliged to you, 
to my desire to play. 

01:10:39.438 --> 01:10:44.260
Give life on Moshi Moshi. 

01:11:15.818 --> 01:11:18.032
I had the strangest dream. 

01:11:18.443 --> 01:11:20.831
I was at a place 
I can not describe. 

01:11:21.232 --> 01:11:23.224
I felt happy. 

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.233
Like I heard 
I was happy. 

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.988
Then your grandfather Gohan, 
and pushed me out. 

01:11:29.989 --> 01:11:32.705
And said, you still 
many had to learn. 

01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:36.161
He is right. We're sorry, 
we did not want you left us. 

01:11:37.967 --> 01:11:40.075
I know. 

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:43.041
I know. 
- That is nice girls ... 

01:11:43.042 --> 01:11:45.780
but we miss something here. 
- The Dragon Balls are gone. 

01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:47.608
We must find them again. 

01:11:48.478 --> 01:11:49.855
Are you ready? 

01:11:50.854 --> 01:11:53.301
I have only one thing to do. 

01:12:31.967 --> 01:12:34.832
I thought I'll never went again. 
- Excuse me. 

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:38.428
I am sorry that I hurt you, 
I would never do. 

01:12:38.429 --> 01:12:40.272
I was just middle 
in the battle and ... 

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.443
I thought you were someone else. 
- Does not matter. 

01:12:42.444 --> 01:12:44.409
I let me save. 

01:12:45.006 --> 01:12:48.356
I was just too fast. 
- You were fast, but I did save me. 

01:12:48.357 --> 01:12:52.120
It was dark, confusing, 
I did not. 

01:12:52.121 --> 01:12:56.166
If you want to make our relationship work 
should we handle this. 

01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:08.166
