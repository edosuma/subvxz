WEBVTT

00:36.536 --> 00:37.412
First time?

00:38.580 --> 00:39.748
Yeah. You?

00:39.831 --> 00:40.957
Second.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.585
Third for him.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.512
Good evening, historians.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.222
Welcome to Regional Update 4.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.933
I'm traveler A-26
of the archivist program.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.352
If this is your first time,
please take a moment

01:01.436 --> 01:04.314
to look inside the bag you were provided
on the way in.

01:07.692 --> 01:11.905
Two green pills are to be taken
immediately following the update.

01:11.988 --> 01:15.116
It's important that we restore
any chemical imbalances in the brain.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.870
The yellow pills
you will need going forward.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.625
From time to time, you may perceive
what we call projections--

01:23.708 --> 01:28.588
visual manifestations of one
or more alternate time lines,

01:28.671 --> 01:32.509
an unavoidable side effect of memory
not acquired by conventional means.

01:33.843 --> 01:37.263
The yellow pills will help to focus
your sensory perception

01:37.347 --> 01:39.224
on one time line at a time.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.811
When you run out,
call this number to arrange for more.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.312
Get that?

01:45.104 --> 01:45.939
Yeah.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.441
Next, Protocol 2H.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.778
The update is not to be discussed

01:52.362 --> 01:54.280
with anyone, ever.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.282
Do not break this protocol.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.119
This update will include
historical information relevant

01:59.202 --> 02:01.496
to your team's role in the Grand Plan,

02:01.579 --> 02:04.415
including potential candidates,
investments, etc.

02:04.499 --> 02:08.545
but by its very nature,
your update may also include

02:08.628 --> 02:11.464
historical information
about your team members,

02:11.548 --> 02:12.674
loved ones,

02:12.757 --> 02:13.883
about you.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.263
This is a burden you will have to carry
with you until the day you die--

02:18.346 --> 02:21.975
a date which, for obvious reasons,
will be omitted from your update.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.353
Any questions?

02:28.565 --> 02:29.566
Let's begin.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.777
[projector clicks and whirs]

02:32.861 --> 02:36.990
[female narrator]
Historians, open memory chain 1A.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.075
[baroque music playing]

03:20.241 --> 03:23.411
[indistinct whispers]

03:26.122 --> 03:27.582
[distant screams]

03:50.230 --> 03:52.607
Hey. [clears throat] I made breakfast.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.317
Uh, I don't want to be late.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.861
Hey, come on, Carly.

03:58.863 --> 03:59.948
Take five minutes.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.578
Grant, they chose me!

04:05.662 --> 04:06.996
Who?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.623
The Pattersons.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.291
Uh...?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.001
You know, the restaurant owners.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.670
Jill.

04:13.753 --> 04:14.587
Jill, right.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.589
And this means what, exactly?

04:18.675 --> 04:21.386
That I will be designing their
new restaurant with a brand-new baby.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.638
Well, you know,
you'll have my help with the baby.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.640
I can't take a job
that I don't have time to do.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.767
Kat. We'll figure it out.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.060
So I should say yes?

04:29.143 --> 04:30.603
-Do you want to say yes?
-Yes.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.646
Then yes.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.314
Okay.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.566
I'll let them know.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.859
Soon.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.364
Nice work.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.543
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.378
What's the mission?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.132
I got a messenger
with lotto numbers yesterday.

04:59.924 --> 05:02.343
Director must have seen we're
in a bit of a financial hole

05:02.427 --> 05:03.678
and decided to step up.

05:03.761 --> 05:04.595
Good.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.682
I obviously can't win any more lotteries
without attracting undue attention,

05:07.765 --> 05:12.395
so you won 86K
in the super draw last night,

05:12.478 --> 05:16.691
and these numbers on the Megaball
for tonight will get you 62.

05:16.774 --> 05:19.319
$62 doesn't sound like very much.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.155
62,000.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.324
Oh. Okay.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.825
You both get six numbers out of seven.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.453
Why don't we just win seven out of seven,
and we're covered?

05:28.536 --> 05:30.913
Because someone else
is supposed to win the Big One

05:30.997 --> 05:32.248
and completely ruin their lives.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.376
-What about me?
-You are too young to gamble.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.587
An excellent example of irony.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.464
[laughing]

05:39.547 --> 05:41.174
So, will that get us out of the hole?

05:41.674 --> 05:42.675
Not even close.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.968
This is seed money.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.595
But I can quadruple it with horse races

05:45.678 --> 05:48.681
and use those earnings to create
something far more substantial.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.435
How does that even work
if the historical record has changed?

05:53.519 --> 05:56.272
The messenger gave me
very detailed instructions.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.482
We're good.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.733
Congratulations, you guys.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.943
-Sweet.
-Thanks.

06:01.027 --> 06:04.739
-[Japanese-style music playing]
-[birds chirping]

06:28.012 --> 06:30.640
[chattering]

06:38.022 --> 06:39.857
So? What'd you think?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.193
I liked it. It's like therapy.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.153
Yeah. That's the idea.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.155
-We should do it more often.
-I'm in.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.448
[Marcy chuckles]

06:47.532 --> 06:49.617
Do you know if there's a store
around here anywhere?

06:49.700 --> 06:52.203
So, do I go for the $3 water,

06:52.286 --> 06:55.414
the luxurious $5 bottle of water

06:55.498 --> 06:58.751
or the suspiciously underpriced
99 cent water?

07:02.213 --> 07:04.298
You're buying a lottery ticket?

07:04.382 --> 07:06.175
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.636
You know, I buy one once in a while,

07:08.719 --> 07:11.055
when the jackpot gets
insanely big like this one.

07:11.722 --> 07:16.227
I don't know why. I mean, any size
jackpot would change my life.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.312
I always play my same lucky numbers.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.773
Yeah? Do you ever win?

07:21.357 --> 07:23.776
-Nope.
-Hmm.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.491
Thank you.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.119
Thanks.

07:35.746 --> 07:36.747
[cash register beeps]

07:36.831 --> 07:40.251
[players shouting]

07:50.470 --> 07:51.387
'Sup?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.055
Why'd you stop playing?

07:55.475 --> 07:56.726
Same reason you did.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.478
You got a concussion, too.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.439
-Whatever, Trevor.
-Whoa-whoa, Kyle!

08:02.148 --> 08:04.859
Don't try to tell me that you don't
remember what he did to us

08:04.942 --> 08:06.486
because of your concussions.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.405
Nobody forgets shit like that.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.701
Maybe I just don't like
to think about it.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.455
[vehicle approaches]

08:22.084 --> 08:23.669
[Trevor] Hey, can I help you?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.714
No, I don't need any help.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.633
Do you need any help?

08:28.716 --> 08:29.717
I'm good.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.385
Yeah, no, we're good.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.095
Who's your friend?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.013
Kyle.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.307
Well, hello, Kyle, nice to meet you.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.393
You know, Trevor and us,
we go way, way back.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.313
I am Hall. This is my associate Luca.

[Kyle] Hey.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.984
Hey, Trevor, I'm gonna go.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.319
I'll catch up with you later.

-Boss, it's me.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.160
[MacLaren over comm]  What's up?

08:56.244 --> 08:58.246
Hall and Luca got out of prison early.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.581
How do you know?

09:00.665 --> 09:02.291
I'm standing right in front of them.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.793
They're parked outside my school.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.337
I guess they don't know
I don't like being watched.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.755
Tough guy. I love it.

09:07.838 --> 09:11.509
Do me a favor.
Um... give my regards to the Boy Scout.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.063
They just drove off.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.731
What was that about?
What did he say?

09:25.815 --> 09:26.983
Nothing.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.818
Just thought you should know.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.571
Thanks for the heads-up.

Hey, Philip.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.762
Got your winnings.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.932
Hopefully we get
more messengers like that.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.022
Where's the rest of it?

10:06.105 --> 10:07.189
I took some.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.526
I need to invest that.

10:11.235 --> 10:14.488
Well, turns out "baby needs
a new pair of shoes" isn't just a saying.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.365
And my van needs a new transmission.

10:18.117 --> 10:18.951
Okay.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.037
I can make it work.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.457
How's all that going, by the way?

10:25.541 --> 10:26.917
You and Jeff and the baby?

10:28.002 --> 10:30.129
Is it... working out?

10:30.713 --> 10:31.922
It's fine. Why?

10:32.548 --> 10:33.507
I don't know. Just asking.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.051
Asking what, exactly?

10:35.134 --> 10:38.054
Uh... if things were okay at home.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.141
You developing a thing for me?

10:42.224 --> 10:43.059
No.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.854
I just haven't... heard you talk
about that in a while.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.147
It's all good.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.065
Great.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.529
I mean, don't get me wrong--
I think you're very attractive.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.614
Um...

11:01.869 --> 11:02.703
This is weird.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.663
I agree.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.665
-I'm gonna go.
-Okay.

with other players?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.688
Man, you know it is.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.275
Then we gotta do something.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.528
Like what?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.198
You want to go to the police,
go to-- go to the school?

13:03.199 --> 13:05.201
Be known as victims
for the rest of our lives?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.452
If that ends it.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.538
He can't stand against both of us.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.668
Look, we did nothing wrong, Kyle.

No, no, no. I'll stay right here,
I promise.

We're gonna get an ultrasound
and assess her from there.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.553
She'll be out shortly.

Good morning, Trevor.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.788
How are your grades?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.957
Have you narrowed down the list
of colleges yet?

to better help you succeed?

[low] I read my employee manual,

14:40.588 --> 14:44.091
and I am ready to guide the shit out
of these pubescent brats.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.594
I need your help with something.

14:50.139 --> 14:50.973
Marcy.

14:54.059 --> 14:54.894
Hey.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.606
Sorry. Do I know you?

14:59.356 --> 15:00.816
It's me. Luca.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.527
2587.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.989
I was just warned about you
watching members of my team.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.450
I only want to talk.

15:10.034 --> 15:10.910
Do you?

15:17.541 --> 15:18.626
[doctor] Hi, Kathryn.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.840
I have the results from the ultrasound,
and the baby is fine.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.842
[sighs] Thank God.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.471
You have formed
a small placental abruption,

15:30.554 --> 15:33.933
so we want you to stay in for a bit
just so we can monitor you and the baby,

15:34.016 --> 15:35.809
make sure it doesn't get any worse.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.519
-What if it does?
-It won't.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.439
If the baby forces our hand,
we can talk about our options,

15:40.522 --> 15:43.400
but for now, we just need
to assess where we're at, okay?

15:43.984 --> 15:45.903
Buzz the nurses if you need anything.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.237
[MacLaren] Thanks.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.628
[Luca] You don't remember anything
from that time?

16:03.253 --> 16:04.129
[Marcy] Nothing.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.882
I was briefed by members of my team
about the time I lost,

16:06.966 --> 16:09.677
but it's not the same
as actually living it.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.637
Well...

16:12.888 --> 16:15.474
At least now I know why you
never came to visit me in prison.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.434
Sorry.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.563
They said you would have died.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.901
Losing my sister before I ever really got
to know her would be worse--

16:25.985 --> 16:27.069
Luca. Luca...

16:28.195 --> 16:29.530
We were separated so young.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.659
We can't know for sure
that we're really family.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.744
[over comm]  Guys, it's Mac.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.664
I'm gonna be unavailable for a while.
There's a problem.

16:38.747 --> 16:39.748
[Carly]  What's wrong?

16:41.208 --> 16:42.626
Kathryn's in the hospital.

16:42.710 --> 16:46.338
She's had some
medical complications, and...

16:46.422 --> 16:48.257
I need to be here with her.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.389
Marcy.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.016
Yeah, I'm on my way.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.684
-Is everything all right?
-Sorry, I have to go.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.566
[machines beeping]

17:32.259 --> 17:33.093
Holy...

17:35.345 --> 17:36.180
Uh...

17:39.892 --> 17:42.978
-[line rings, beeps]
- Hey, this is Marcy. Leave a message.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.480
Marcy, I won the lottery.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.400
[coughs] Six numbers out of seven.
That's-- that's 31,000--

17:48.484 --> 17:50.402
$31,000!

17:51.278 --> 17:52.821
Isn't that freakin' amazing?

17:53.572 --> 17:57.201
It would have been 62,000,
but someone else won the lottery.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.702
Oh, my God.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.081
Oh, my God, that's you.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.918
'Cause I took your numbers.
You won the lottery, too. Congratulations!

18:07.503 --> 18:12.091
Wait... I mean, that-- that means
I took half your money.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.551
I mean, that-- that's like cheating.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.178
Um...

18:16.929 --> 18:19.181
Yeah, you know what?
I should just give it to you.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.099
So...

18:21.100 --> 18:22.726
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do!

18:22.810 --> 18:23.644
[chuckles]

18:24.853 --> 18:27.189
But what are the chances
that your numbers would be picked

18:27.272 --> 18:28.899
any more than mine, right?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.736
Oh, my God, did you hear the greed
in my voice? Because I sure did.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.947
Whoa!

18:35.030 --> 18:36.865
I may as well have just come out and said,

18:36.949 --> 18:38.158
"That money's mine!"

18:38.242 --> 18:39.076
Hmm.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.871
[sighs] This is how money ruins people.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.750
I think I'm going to be sick.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.089
[line ringing]

18:54.258 --> 18:55.425
Still no answer.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.056
We said we'd meet
after second period.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.935
You know, for my first actual case
as a guidance counselor,

19:05.018 --> 19:06.645
you could have eased me into it.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.105
Hold it!

19:08.188 --> 19:10.149
I have been looking all over for you.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.110
Connor needs a QB who can hit him
in the hands if we want to win State.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.702
So...

19:21.785 --> 19:23.245
love to have you out.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.297
And, Connor, how are things?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.591
Could use my old quarterback on the team.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.677
Talk some sense into him.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.013
Oh, I don't understand sportsball, so...

19:41.638 --> 19:43.724
Can't keep your spot open
for you forever, Trev.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.525
Why didn't you deal with him right then?

19:53.609 --> 19:54.943
Not in front of the kid.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.196
It's gonna be hard enough
on him as it is.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.495
[sighs]

20:18.592 --> 20:19.593
[hip-hop music playing]

20:19.676 --> 20:21.136

20:21.220 --> 20:22.429
[Jeff] Seventy-eight...

20:23.430 --> 20:24.264
seventy-nine...

20:26.475 --> 20:28.101
one-thousand!

20:29.436 --> 20:31.063
[laughs]

20:32.147 --> 20:33.982
I'm really digging working out together.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.567
Yeah? That's good.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.612
And this playlist? Damn.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.114
You like it?

20:41.198 --> 20:42.032
Oh, yeah.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.744
We gotta get that that core engaged,
right?

20:45.827 --> 20:47.746
Right? Get that heart rate up.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.830
What?

20:48.914 --> 20:50.123
Ohh.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.668
You know what I mean?

20:52.751 --> 20:53.752
[laughs]

20:53.835 --> 20:56.838
Unh! Come on, Carly,
you know that body like to dance.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.218
[chuckling]
I don't even know what you're doing.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.596
Come on, Carly,
it'll come to you. Let it go.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.808
[hip-hop continues]

21:11.687 --> 21:12.521
That's right.

21:12.604 --> 21:13.814
Okay.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.484
There she is.

21:19.820 --> 21:20.654
Mmm!

21:22.489 --> 21:24.616
[Jeffrey Jr. cries]

21:39.506 --> 21:40.340
Hey.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.633
What'd you find?

21:41.717 --> 21:42.926
Took a look at her file.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.220
There's nothing out of the ordinary.
She's stable.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.055
Her blood pressure's a little high--

21:47.139 --> 21:49.933
Those drugs you gave me,
shouldn't they have protected her?

21:50.017 --> 21:52.811
They were designed to help,
not to make her invulnerable.

21:52.894 --> 21:55.355
[sighs] Well, how do we get you in there?

21:55.439 --> 21:56.648
I don't think you understand.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.650
There's nothing even I could do.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.652
She's right where she needs to be.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.362
If they need to take the baby out early,

22:02.446 --> 22:05.324
Caesarean section is a standard procedure
for these doctors.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.580
Medicine isn't magic, in any time.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.667
Would you like me
to inform the team what's going on?

22:17.169 --> 22:18.170
No.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.173
No, I'll do it when the time is right.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.763
And, uh... yeah.

22:27.846 --> 22:31.224
Just feels good to know I'm not doing that
to my family anymore.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.726
[group] Thank you, Mike.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.563
Philip.

22:37.647 --> 22:38.857
Did you want to share?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.527
Uh, yeah, I do.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.529
[clears throat]

22:44.613 --> 22:46.656
Hi, my name's Philip,
and I'm an addict.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.492
[group] Hi, Philip.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.368
[Philip clears throat]

22:51.453 --> 22:52.871
I have a secret.

22:54.790 --> 22:55.999
I know the future.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.295
I know what's gonna happen.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.466
Global events. Deaths.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.927
Winners of horse races.

23:08.386 --> 23:11.389
It was all recently delivered to me,
like a movie.

23:15.102 --> 23:18.730
And mostly it's the same future
that I remember,

23:18.814 --> 23:20.232
but there are differences.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.404
You all think I'm crazy right now...

23:28.031 --> 23:29.241
but it's true.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.704
For example...

23:35.914 --> 23:37.666
I know that somebody in this room

23:37.749 --> 23:39.835
has very recently been diagnosed
with cancer

23:39.918 --> 23:41.419
and has decided to ignore it...

23:44.047 --> 23:46.883
as if ignoring the problem
is gonna make it go away.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.430
Because there's only a 50/50 chance...

23:52.430 --> 23:54.057
that the treatment will work.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.939
They're afraid of going through the pain
of chemotherapy for nothing.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.776
[voice breaking]
And the truth is, I don't know...

24:05.902 --> 24:08.280
whether this person's
going to live or die

24:08.363 --> 24:10.031
if they decide to get treatment.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.453
I only know for certain
that without it...

24:15.078 --> 24:16.079
[man] Philip?

24:18.665 --> 24:19.499
Philip.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.296
I'm sorry, what was I saying?

24:25.755 --> 24:26.631
Not much.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.553
[man] You stopped talking after you said,
"I have a secret."

24:34.389 --> 24:35.223
Oh.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.476
I'm sorry. Um...

24:38.560 --> 24:41.271
Maybe... someone else should go.

24:41.354 --> 24:42.731
It's all right.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.234
We've all been there.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.583
I'm on my way now.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.543
Don't worry about it, bro,
we're gonna do this.

25:45.627 --> 25:46.920
Have you been drinking?

25:47.003 --> 25:48.004
Pull over.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.090
Trevor, I'm fine. Chill.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.174
Where are you?

25:51.258 --> 25:52.676
Where are you? Where are you?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.840
Oh, hey, nurse, how's she doing?

26:33.216 --> 26:35.844
Excuse me.
I asked you a question.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.768
No.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.145
It was for your own good.

26:45.979 --> 26:46.938
What did you do?

26:48.023 --> 26:50.734
-[alarm beeping]
-[woman over PA]  Code blue! Code blue!

26:50.817 --> 26:53.403
- Re-sus team to room 312 immediately.
-Go be with her.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.242
Dr. Higgins, what's happening?

26:59.326 --> 27:02.620
I can't talk right now, Mr. MacLaren.
Please stay out of the way.

[woman over PA]
Re-sus team to room 312.

Philip, I need eyes on Hall right now.
He's leaving the hospital.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.966
[Philip over comm]  I'm on it.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.259
Don't lose him.

There's something wrong
with this host.

28:17.695 --> 28:19.072
I know.

28:26.663 --> 28:27.914
welcome to the 21st.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.343
This is too much.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.263
[laughs] Andrew,
I have watched you do everything

28:43.346 --> 28:45.140
in your power
to change your circumstances.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.433
I mean, you got clean,

28:46.516 --> 28:49.060
you got that part-time job
at the grocery store.

28:49.144 --> 28:52.147
This is just a little financial help
to put a roof over your head.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.232
But I'll never be able to repay you.
This is--

28:54.315 --> 28:55.692
No, I don't want you to.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.194
Just keep doing what you're doing,

28:58.278 --> 29:00.989
and I'll count myself lucky to know you.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.492
-I don't know what to say.
-You don't have to say anything.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.869
Ohh!

29:05.952 --> 29:06.953
Thank you, David!

29:08.037 --> 29:09.247

29:10.540 --> 29:13.960
Okay. Okay.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.940
I'd like to make your day.

Come on.
You must know something by now.

29:46.201 --> 29:49.829
My latest information
is that your wife is still in surgery.

29:50.830 --> 29:51.915

29:53.625 --> 29:55.043
Would you come with me, please?

30:04.260 --> 30:05.386
[Trevor] Philip!

30:05.970 --> 30:06.971
Look, I need your help.

30:08.807 --> 30:13.812
Look, I know that the historical record's
changed since we got here.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.189
But not everything, right?
A lot stays the same.

30:16.272 --> 30:17.273
Yeah, why?

30:17.357 --> 30:21.402
Carson Perry. He's a football coach
at my high school. Ring any bells?

30:21.986 --> 30:23.196
Uhh...

30:24.989 --> 30:26.658
-[sighs]
-Come on. Dig deep.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.953
Carson Perry.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.872
Gets arrested on 16 counts
of sexual assault charges

30:32.956 --> 30:35.583
as well as possession and distribution
of underage pornography.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.836
-When?
-Not soon.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.753
We can't wait.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.005
I been through this.
You assign yourself vigilante missions--

30:41.089 --> 30:43.299
What if it's my protocol five?

30:44.133 --> 30:47.846
I recently learned that my host
was abused before I got here by him.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.224
I had no idea.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.308
Neither did I.

30:54.477 --> 30:57.981
I promised my friend Kyle
that I would help take him down just now.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.149
-Kyle was a host candidate.
-You knew?

31:00.233 --> 31:02.527
3:09 this afternoon. Driving drunk.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.611
I'm sorry.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.697
I understand why you couldn't tell me,

31:05.780 --> 31:07.991
but as far as I'm concerned,
that coach killed him.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.410
I need to fix this.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.078
[pounding on door]

31:15.623 --> 31:17.458
Mr. MacLaren, in this case,

31:17.542 --> 31:22.422
it was Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome
or APS.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.507
She developed an arterial thrombus

31:24.591 --> 31:26.801
which then caused a coronary embolism,

31:26.885 --> 31:29.429
which is a clot in the heart.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.098
Kathryn went into cardiac arrest.

31:33.725 --> 31:37.770
Mr. MacLaren, in our efforts
to save Kathryn's life--

31:37.854 --> 31:39.355
We lost the baby.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.440
Yes.

31:40.523 --> 31:41.524
And all I can say

31:41.608 --> 31:44.694
is that it's extremely fortunate
that that clot passed on its own,

31:44.777 --> 31:48.615
or this would be an even more difficult
conversation for both of us to have.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.329
When can I see her?

31:55.121 --> 31:58.750
She's in recovery, she's sedated,
but you can see her in a few hours.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.130
Mr. MacLaren, we have counselors
available if you need them.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.215
Philip, tell me where Hall is.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.508
[Philip over comm]  Boss, he's here.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.426
What?

32:12.555 --> 32:13.556
Hey, boss.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.474
Easy.

32:14.557 --> 32:16.100
-Get off of me!
-Listen.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.268
[Trevor] We can't do that.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.270
-You're a fuckin' dead man.
-I know, I know.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.772
-You killed my child!
-Not what happened.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.066
You better hope the Director
overwrites you before I get my--

32:23.149 --> 32:25.360
The Director was the one who sent me!

32:26.402 --> 32:27.654
I was on a mission.

32:28.988 --> 32:29.822
Let him go.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.200
Let him go.

32:33.534 --> 32:34.369
There you go.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.665
What are you talking about?

32:39.540 --> 32:42.919
The child was never gonna survive.
It was never supposed to.

32:43.002 --> 32:43.836
You don't know that.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.630
My mission was to save your wife.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.385
-There had to be a way to save them both.
-[Marcy] I don't think there was.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.221
Listen to your medic, MacLaren.

32:55.598 --> 32:56.808
What'd you do?

32:56.891 --> 33:00.853
Kathryn MacLaren was going to die
of an undiagnosed coronary embolism

33:00.937 --> 33:04.190
that stopped her heart during the delivery
of her stillborn child.

33:04.774 --> 33:07.443
The Director ordered me
to give her a traveler-synthesized drug

33:07.527 --> 33:09.654
to eliminate the clot
so that she would survive

33:09.737 --> 33:11.948
because she wasn't supposed to die.

33:13.032 --> 33:16.035
Because you broke protocol four.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.834
She wanted a child more than anything.

33:23.918 --> 33:26.754
You're gonna stand there
and blame her for this?

33:26.838 --> 33:28.047
Is that what you're doing?

33:32.218 --> 33:33.386
No.

33:33.469 --> 33:34.303
Right.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.305
Look, I get it.

33:37.306 --> 33:39.308
I get it's tough to stay focused
in the 21st.

33:39.392 --> 33:42.020
That's what I've been trying
to tell you guys ever since I met you.

33:42.645 --> 33:46.232
Trying to teach you guys to not get
caught up in all the bullshit.

33:47.942 --> 33:50.111
But you had to stab me
in the back, huh?

33:52.655 --> 33:56.075
The Director obviously agreed with me,
or you wouldn't have gone to prison.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.291
Yeah, I-- I can't argue with that.

34:04.292 --> 34:07.045
I guess we all need a lesson now and then
on what our mission is.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.130
And this was yours.

34:10.298 --> 34:13.342
But, hey, MacLaren,
your wife is still alive.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.096
Go be with her.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.310
[sighs]

34:41.496 --> 34:42.789
Welcome home.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.707
Hey, yeah. Sorry.

34:44.791 --> 34:45.792
[chuckles] Hi.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.460
I know it's later than I said.

34:47.543 --> 34:50.004
[Jeffrey Jr. chattering]

34:50.088 --> 34:51.089
Can I hold him?

34:51.172 --> 34:52.799
I was trying to get him to go to sleep.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.467
I know. I don't care.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.384
Hey.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.012
You wanna cuddle
with your mama, big man?

35:01.099 --> 35:04.852
So... how was today for Carly Shannon?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.854
Well, it's over now.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.147
Let's leave it at that.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.065
You?

35:09.148 --> 35:10.441
Oh, I had a pay duty.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.820
I basically chaperoned some drunk
college kids around for time and a half.

35:14.987 --> 35:15.822
Sounds awful.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.323
Eh, wasn't so bad.

35:17.907 --> 35:18.825
You okay?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.452
Tell me about the day he was born.

35:23.746 --> 35:25.164
Um...

35:25.248 --> 35:27.250
are you sure you want
to go there right now?

35:27.333 --> 35:29.585
'Cause that's not your favorite story.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.589
I want to hear it from your perspective.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.261
[chuckles]

35:55.987 --> 35:57.071
Grant.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.156
I'm here.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.997
They told me she was a girl.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.588
[Kat sobbing]

36:40.031 --> 36:43.242
Holden. Change your mind?

36:43.326 --> 36:44.827
You're gonna come clean.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.245
Sorry?

36:46.329 --> 36:48.581
You're gonna come forward
to the police,

36:48.664 --> 36:51.083
and you're gonna detail
all that you've done.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.253
Trevor, wh-wh-what are you
talking about?

36:54.337 --> 36:56.172
Do it on your own volition

36:56.255 --> 36:58.633
and face the consequences,
or it'll be done for you.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.554
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.764
I'm not gonna do that.

37:05.848 --> 37:08.267
Those are your only two options, so...

37:08.351 --> 37:11.020
I don't think you realize
what you're doing here.

37:12.563 --> 37:15.650
You're really willing to throw everything
away to destroy both of our lives?

37:15.733 --> 37:18.027
-There's other lives to consider.
-Oh, come on.

37:18.110 --> 37:20.196
Maybe you don't want
to play football anymore,

37:20.279 --> 37:22.865
but you do not want the shit storm
that'll come from this.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.660
Hey, you prey on young boys
who look up to you.

37:27.662 --> 37:30.498
You make promises in exchange
for access to their bodies.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.585
Come on, Trev.

37:34.669 --> 37:35.878
I will come forward.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.760
I'll talk about the hotel rooms
on the road,

37:42.843 --> 37:44.303
the showers,

37:44.887 --> 37:45.888
all of it.

37:46.472 --> 37:47.682
Who's gonna believe you?

37:48.557 --> 37:50.685
You're a bad kid,
and everybody knows it.

37:50.768 --> 37:51.769
People change.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.479
Not the Trevor Holden I know.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.774
I don't know where this act came from,

37:56.857 --> 37:59.151
but I don't buy it for a second.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.903
I know you.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.530
Intimately.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.325
You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

38:06.409 --> 38:09.370
-I'm not threatened by you.
-You should be.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.625
Don't push me, kid.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.973
Release the materials.

38:29.056 --> 38:30.850
-[Philip over comm]  On it.
-Release the materials?

38:30.933 --> 38:32.351
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

38:36.605 --> 38:38.107
Whew.

38:38.190 --> 38:39.900
Thank you, Philip. Ahem.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.652
That's what Trevor and Kyle
would have wanted.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.864
All we did was accelerate
what was going to happen anyway.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.327
Freak had whole hard drives
of incriminating shit.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.996
Yeah, he made his choice.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.790
[computer chimes]

38:59.503 --> 39:00.338
No.

39:02.798 --> 39:04.091
What?

39:06.052 --> 39:06.969
Oh, no.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.891
[telephone rings]

39:11.974 --> 39:13.392
Oh, no.

39:13.476 --> 39:14.685
Oh, my God.

[door opens]

39:36.791 --> 39:37.792
There she is!

39:39.585 --> 39:41.045
Did you get your winnings?

39:41.128 --> 39:43.047
I did. Amazing luck.

39:43.130 --> 39:44.215
Isn't it?

39:44.298 --> 39:46.717
You're not upset that I cheated?

39:46.801 --> 39:47.802
No, of course not.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.095
I'm happy for you.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.471
You must be thrilled.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.972
Yeah. Yeah.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.140
It's all gone.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.434
What?

39:55.518 --> 39:57.520
Did you ever hear the story
of St. Francis?

39:57.603 --> 39:58.437
No.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.856
Yeah, no, me either.
Somebody called me that today.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.402
Uh... I don't understand.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.821
I didn't feel right taking
what would have been yours

40:06.904 --> 40:08.114
if I hadn't peeked at your numbers.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.408
And I know that you wouldn't
let me give it back,

40:10.491 --> 40:12.618
so I gave it all away!

40:13.702 --> 40:14.829
I helped out a lot of good people.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.455
Honestly, Marcy, it was--

40:16.539 --> 40:18.165
it was the best day of my life.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.919
You remember my--
my client Jason?

40:22.420 --> 40:24.839
With the bad teeth and the hair?

40:24.922 --> 40:26.048
Yeah, I do.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.675
Yeah. Great teeth now.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.385
I mean, they will be.

40:29.468 --> 40:31.887
Even getting them cleaned
has made a huge difference.

40:31.971 --> 40:34.515
And on Wednesday, he's got
some much-needed dental work.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.351
Whoa. Good for Jason.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.520
Yeah, no, he hates dentists.

40:39.603 --> 40:40.938
Who else?

40:41.564 --> 40:43.566
Um, I'm not sure
if you remember Marjorie.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.359
I bought her a new walker.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.986
They're pricey for what they are.

40:47.069 --> 40:50.573
Uh, Steve got one of those scooters
to get to his new job.

40:50.656 --> 40:53.659
He can't walk very far
without breaking into a sweat.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.412
Jordan got my bike
for his pizza delivery job.

40:56.495 --> 40:57.329
Your bike?

40:57.413 --> 41:00.249
Yeah. Yeah. I thought I'd
buy myself a new one.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.502
I should have saved some.

41:04.712 --> 41:05.588
All of it.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.465
I know it sounded like a lot of money,

41:07.548 --> 41:10.009
but, I mean, everything is
just so expensive.

41:10.092 --> 41:13.262
I mean, I had a whole list of people.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.140
David.

41:16.223 --> 41:19.059
It doesn't matter. I'll get my steps in.

41:19.143 --> 41:19.977
So...

41:21.687 --> 41:22.688
What are you gonna do with yours?

41:23.731 --> 41:24.773
Um...

41:25.274 --> 41:27.109
I have some debts to pay off.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.319
Debts?

41:28.819 --> 41:30.404
Wow. That is responsible.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.322
[chuckles]

41:31.405 --> 41:32.907
I should have some left over.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.159
Even more responsible.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.912
So, what are you gonna do with it?

41:38.496 --> 41:42.750
Well, first,
I'm going to buy you a new bike.

41:43.709 --> 41:45.461
I'm so happy you said that.

41:46.045 --> 41:48.214
[laughing]

41:58.140 --> 42:00.684
What's happening right now?
Where the hell is this kid?

42:03.270 --> 42:04.188
Give him a minute.

42:04.271 --> 42:05.481
He's probably hung over.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.608
I'm sorry, he's what?

42:12.154 --> 42:13.155
Sorry I'm late.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.866
Just having a hard time deciding
what clothing to bring with me.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.953
Yeah, not a problem, kid.
Just don't make it a habit.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.290
So, what's the mission?

42:23.374 --> 42:26.293
...the Prime Minister
has called highly threatening.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.587
[Philip reciting in tandem] This will
severely impact foreign relations

42:28.671 --> 42:32.466
if troops continue to invade the region
against UN sanctions.

42:33.050 --> 42:37.263
In local news, a fire ravaged
a downtown apartment complex last night,

42:37.346 --> 42:39.056
and authorities are saying the cause of it

42:39.139 --> 42:41.684
is looking more and more likely
to be arson...

to escape without harm,

but the blaze did cause millions
of dollars in property damage.

43:04.206 --> 43:07.668
And finally tonight,
a Tacoma resident is making waves...

43:07.751 --> 43:11.130
[man]  The yellow pills will help you
focus your sensory perception

43:11.213 --> 43:12.881
on one time line at a time...

43:14.633 --> 43:17.970
an unavoidable side effect of memory
not acquired by conventional means.

43:19.179 --> 43:20.889
[newscaster]  ...school science fair,

43:20.973 --> 43:24.143
but when it won first place
and went to the regional finals,

43:24.226 --> 43:25.894
it caught the eye of an entrepreneur

43:25.978 --> 43:28.063
who has partnered
with the budding scientist

43:28.147 --> 43:30.733
and intends to take the litter
to market next year.

43:30.816 --> 43:32.318
That's our show for tonight.

43:32.401 --> 43:35.738
We hope you have a pleasant evening,
and an even better tomorrow.
