WEBVTT

00:03.212 --> 00:04.588
I'm getting
really sick and tired

00:04.672 --> 00:07.174
of this "having to tell you
what happened last week" shit.

00:07.258 --> 00:09.176
Take some notes or something.

00:09.260 --> 00:12.138
Get a pencil.
Grab some paper.

00:12.221 --> 00:15.099
I'm serious.
I can wait.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.691
Your father is gonna be
the new Hobo Loco

00:23.774 --> 00:25.776
beverage spokesperson.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.279
Soon I'll be able
to support those I love.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.447
Little Frank-ettes.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.906
<i>Each day, you'll be given</i>

00:30.990 --> 00:32.616
<i>timed challenges.
Those of you</i>

00:32.700 --> 00:34.326
who fail
to complete the tasks

00:34.410 --> 00:35.327
will be eliminated.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.789
All's fair in love
and hobo wars, Frank.

00:38.873 --> 00:40.249
Whoa!

00:40.332 --> 00:41.667
All's fair, Mikey O.

00:41.751 --> 00:42.960
All's fair.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.420
You will bleed out
and die

00:44.503 --> 00:46.172
if you carry six babies
to term.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.757
She's trying to kill my babies!

00:47.840 --> 00:48.841
Ingrid?
Ingrid?

00:48.924 --> 00:50.593
Oh, crap.

00:50.676 --> 00:51.969
I think I might be gay.

00:52.053 --> 00:52.928
I've just been feeling ways

00:53.012 --> 00:54.055
that I never felt before.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.390
Nice ass.

00:56.474 --> 00:58.309
Hey, so what's the job?
Busboy?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.685
Uh, dishwasher?

00:59.769 --> 01:01.437
Street corner sign spinner.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.564
<i>You'll be back
tomorrow, right?</i>

01:03.647 --> 01:04.690
Yeah.

01:04.774 --> 01:05.775
Die!

01:05.858 --> 01:06.859
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop!

01:06.942 --> 01:07.943
We don't like him.

01:08.027 --> 01:10.404
Santiago's a good guy.

01:10.488 --> 01:12.782
Oh, fuck.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.116
- Xan?
- I didn't know

01:14.200 --> 01:15.367
where else to go.

01:15.451 --> 01:16.285
Yo, wakey, wakey.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.411
Get the fuck away from me!

01:17.495 --> 01:18.579
<i>You smell like booze.</i>

01:18.662 --> 01:20.623
- You're fired.
- What?

01:20.706 --> 01:22.291
<i>Some lady
called the cops on me.</i>

01:22.374 --> 01:23.501
<i>- What'd you do?
- Selling lemonade</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:24.418
<i>in front of her house.</i>

01:24.502 --> 01:26.295
Motherfucker.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.173
That was my brother
with the lemonade stand.

Good morning,
peaches and cream,

02:56.760 --> 02:58.137
number one girl.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.181
How's my six embryos today?

03:00.264 --> 03:01.515
<i>You mean George,</i>

03:01.599 --> 03:02.766
Gordy, Glenn, Gladys,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.351
Gina, and Gabby Gallagher?

03:04.435 --> 03:06.145
We're pissed, Frank.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.230
We're pregnant
and we're lonely

03:08.314 --> 03:10.274
and we're tired of hiding
from Dr. Kwan

03:10.357 --> 03:12.943
in this dark rat cave basement.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.904
The final's today.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.239
I want you home now.
I want you home now.

03:17.323 --> 03:20.075
<i>I want you the fuck home now.</i>

03:20.159 --> 03:21.160
<i>Right now.</i>

03:21.243 --> 03:23.245
Well, yeah, sure,

03:24.121 --> 03:27.041
you--you want that, honey.

03:27.124 --> 03:31.378
This is for the future
of our children.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.380
You can't ask me
to quit now.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.090
You can't ask LeBron James

03:35.174 --> 03:36.926
<i>not to play in the playoffs.</i>

03:37.009 --> 03:40.346
I'll be home tonight,
a winner,

03:40.429 --> 03:42.306
<i>50--</i>

03:42.389 --> 03:43.641
Motherfucker!

03:43.724 --> 03:45.184
Ingy?

03:47.102 --> 03:48.687
Things
a tad stressful

03:48.771 --> 03:51.232
with the little lady, Frank?

03:51.315 --> 03:54.068
Might be time to wash up
and head home.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.569
Nah.

03:55.653 --> 03:58.197
She was just calling
to remind me

03:58.280 --> 04:01.283
to be humble when I win.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.244
I don't know.

04:03.327 --> 04:07.289
That sounded a lot like a woman
wanting you to quit.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.375
Probably should.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.419
I've quit many things
in my life, Mikey--

04:12.503 --> 04:14.838
school, jobs, marriages,

04:14.922 --> 04:16.966
rehab several times.

04:17.049 --> 04:20.094
I am not quitting this.

04:20.177 --> 04:23.722
I am the Hobo Loco Mofo.

04:23.806 --> 04:26.141
Okay...

04:27.559 --> 04:30.312
<i>♪♪ Oh ♪♪</i>

04:30.396 --> 04:33.524
<i>♪♪ You don't even know
what you're talking about ♪♪</i>

05:29.079 --> 05:30.914
What are you doing?
That's my Oxy!

05:30.998 --> 05:32.708
Hey, that bitch
stole my Oxy!

05:32.791 --> 05:34.376
You fucking skank bitch!

05:34.460 --> 05:35.544
Get her!

05:48.182 --> 05:50.059
South Side piece of shit!

05:57.149 --> 05:58.484
Croissants?

05:58.567 --> 05:59.818
Where the hell'd
we get croissants?

05:59.902 --> 06:02.196
That Randy guy
keeps dropping off baked goods.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.405
Who?

06:03.489 --> 06:05.407
Mm, creepy guy.
Ingrid's ex-husband.

06:05.491 --> 06:06.992
The more she refuses
to come out of the basement,

06:07.076 --> 06:08.410
the more baked goods
he drops off

06:08.494 --> 06:10.204
on our front porch.
I mean, look at this.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.998
Cinnamon rolls, doughnut,
doughnut holes...

06:13.082 --> 06:14.625
Kelly, have you tried
the cinnamon bread yet?

06:14.708 --> 06:15.959
I know.
Better than sex.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.128
Mm.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.588
What's everybody
up to today?

06:19.671 --> 06:22.216
Carl's looking
for buried treasure!

06:22.299 --> 06:24.176
Oh, laugh it up, guys,
laugh it up,

06:24.259 --> 06:26.345
but come payday, you'll see
who the real captain is.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.722
I gotta replace
that janky furnace today.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.766
You know how much
the guy quoted me one for?

06:30.849 --> 06:32.309
- 7,500 bucks.
- Jesus.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.353
Yeah, I'm gonna find
a used one on Craigslist.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.897
Craigslist is for murderers,
isn't it?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.315
Nah.
I've Craigslist-ed, like,

06:38.399 --> 06:41.068
40 times.
Only gotten rape-y vibes once.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.153
You should try the scrapyard
out past West Lake.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.863
My dad used to go there
for parts

06:44.947 --> 06:45.948
when he was rebuilding
his World War II

06:46.031 --> 06:47.241
reenactment Sherman tanks,

06:47.324 --> 06:48.325
and we saw furnaces there
all the time.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.785
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.578
- Where in West Lake?
- I'll show you.

06:51.662 --> 06:52.955
I don't have anything else
going on today.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.164
- Cool.
- Um, no,

06:54.248 --> 06:55.249
you have softball camp,

06:55.332 --> 06:56.625
so you can't hang out

06:56.708 --> 06:57.751
with Debbie today,
'cause softball camp.

06:57.835 --> 06:58.836
"Softball camp."

06:58.919 --> 07:00.295
You can skip camp,
can't you, Kell?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.256
Totally.
Girls' day.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.674
We'll bring Franny.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.134
It's a date.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.220
Hey.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.098
May I interest you
in a croissant?

07:11.181 --> 07:12.433
We're a regular Starbucks.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.935
No, thanks, I'm good.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.314
Hey, um, are you still good
to give me and Xan

07:19.398 --> 07:21.275
- a ride downtown at 10:00?
- Why are doughnuts...

07:21.358 --> 07:22.651
- Yeah, uh, totally.
- Yeah?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.528
Great.
I'll see you then.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.654
Okay.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.782
<i>Kev, come on!</i>

07:28.866 --> 07:30.742
We're gonna be late!

07:30.826 --> 07:32.703
<i>Uh...</i>

07:32.786 --> 07:33.996
<i>You go ahead!</i>

07:34.079 --> 07:35.747
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

07:35.831 --> 07:38.208
With what car?
What are you talking about?

07:38.292 --> 07:40.377
Come on!

07:40.461 --> 07:42.212
Hey!
What are you doing?

07:42.296 --> 07:43.297
We're gonna be late!

07:43.380 --> 07:44.465
I Googled it.

07:44.548 --> 07:45.549
<i>Googled what?</i>

07:45.632 --> 07:47.009
Vasectomies.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.760
<i>I saw a video on YouTube,
and no,</i>

07:48.844 --> 07:50.137
<i>I'm not doing that shit.
No.</i>

07:50.220 --> 07:52.014
It's a two-millimeter incision

07:52.097 --> 07:53.307
that heals in two days.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.725
The common cold lasts longer.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.393
It's an incision with a knife

07:56.477 --> 07:57.728
into my ball bag.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.396
It's what 89% of people do

07:59.480 --> 08:01.023
when they don't want
to have kids anymore.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.358
You agreed to this.
You said you wanted to do it.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.235
I was emotionally distraught

08:05.319 --> 08:06.820
from losing Santiago!

08:06.904 --> 08:08.197
Kevin Ball,

08:08.280 --> 08:10.157
get your ass out here
right now,

08:10.240 --> 08:12.701
before I Lorena Bobbit you
myself.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.878
Excellent.
In the car.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.755
Ball family, out!

08:26.256 --> 08:28.091
Ball out.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.053
All right, hobos.
The final day

08:31.136 --> 08:33.847
of the Hobo Loco Man challenge
is upon us.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.807
Today, one of you
will be crowned

08:35.891 --> 08:37.351
the Hobo Loco Man.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.979
Three rounds today:

08:41.063 --> 08:43.273
quarterfinals, semifinals,
and finals.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.442
The first challenge is begging!

08:46.944 --> 08:48.487
You'll have two hours

08:48.570 --> 08:51.573
to make as much money
as you can begging.

08:53.158 --> 08:56.495
Who do you think
our competition is today?

08:56.578 --> 08:59.957
Hmm, sorority girl, I think,
is the dark horse.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.460
I had a cousin once.
She was part of the Delta Nu.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.003
She's dead.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.880
Gloria?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.886
Jesus.
But this guy.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.388
He may be a strong finisher.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.974
I saw him take a shit
in the alley

09:17.057 --> 09:18.600
with no TP.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.269
Wiped himself with a taco.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.688
Hard or soft?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.606
The taco?

09:24.690 --> 09:27.734
- Hard.
- Wow.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.031
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.452
.27.
Coming in hot.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.537
Wow.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.330
Your blood
is basically jet fuel.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.292
I've been training
my whole life for this day.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.961
.27 as well.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.879
Ain't we even stephens?

09:47.963 --> 09:49.840
All right, can I get
two hours on the clock?

09:54.219 --> 09:55.887
And...

09:55.971 --> 09:57.264
Go!

09:57.347 --> 10:00.809
Come on, let's go,
go, go!

10:03.437 --> 10:06.273
Tami's not here.
Should we bounce?

10:06.356 --> 10:08.483
Let's give her
another minute.

10:08.567 --> 10:09.818
See?
There.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.903
That grate opens up to it.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.989
If one of us goes under

10:14.072 --> 10:15.574
and pushes up and one of us
stays here and pulls up...

10:15.657 --> 10:17.034
We'll be able
to get it out!

10:17.117 --> 10:19.369
Are you a top
or a bottom?

10:20.871 --> 10:22.164
- I mean...
- I'll go down.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.332
- You stay here.
- Right.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.750
What you said.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.376
You're looking a little flushed
there, Debs.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.794
- You okay?
- Shut up.

10:27.878 --> 10:28.962
What are you guys
still doing here?

10:29.046 --> 10:30.422
Shouldn't you be downtown?

10:30.505 --> 10:31.548
Yeah, you're right.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.966
I should text her,
see what's up.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.718
<i>Okay.
Ready up there?</i>

10:34.801 --> 10:36.136
Yeah.
You got room to push?

10:36.219 --> 10:38.764
<i>I think so.</i>

10:40.474 --> 10:42.309
Jesus.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.146
All right, Xan, come on.
We gotta take the El.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.522
What happened to Tami?

10:47.606 --> 10:48.899
She has to bail.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.233
That all she said?

10:50.317 --> 10:51.234
She gotta bail?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.694
No text, no emoji,

10:52.778 --> 10:54.780
- no sorry?
- Yeah. So?

10:54.863 --> 10:56.657
So she flew out of here
this morning

10:56.740 --> 10:59.868
and now you're getting
non-emoji cancellation texts?

10:59.951 --> 11:02.245
- You're getting the D, son.
- Oh, come on.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.497
People are allowed to bail,
all right?

11:03.580 --> 11:04.873
Stuff comes up.
Texts are short.

11:04.956 --> 11:05.957
Uh-huh.
Whatever helps you

11:06.041 --> 11:07.292
sleep at night, pal.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.710
She's right.
It's not looking good for you.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.629
All right.
Come on, Xan.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.590
Push!

11:18.512 --> 11:20.222
<i>Oh, yeah?
Well, I quit!</i>

11:27.729 --> 11:29.564
You ever worked
on the line, Carl?

11:29.648 --> 11:31.191
In the kitchen?

11:31.274 --> 11:34.027
Okay, let me ask you this.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.529
Can you work Labor Day?

11:36.655 --> 11:37.656
I guess.

11:37.739 --> 11:38.907
Grab an apron.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.495
The twins tortured
the Guatemalan refugees,

11:43.578 --> 11:45.038
not me.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.207
That's why this whole thing
is bullshit.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.542
Now my wife's like,

11:48.625 --> 11:49.960
"We can't bring babies
into the world,

11:50.043 --> 11:51.545
because if we do,
?
our daughters will kill them.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.839
Well, why is that
my scrotum's fault,

11:53.922 --> 11:55.215
and why can't she just take
the pill,

11:55.298 --> 11:57.300
like other women?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.468
Why is it so much worse for her

11:58.552 --> 11:59.845
to take a tiny little pill

11:59.928 --> 12:01.388
that makes her "crazy"
than it is for me

12:01.471 --> 12:03.098
to get my testicle lobbed off?

12:03.181 --> 12:05.392
Your testicle
will not be "lobbed off," sir.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.144
Only your vas deferens tubes
are blocked.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.562
Oh, it's bullshit.

12:08.645 --> 12:09.938
I'm calling bullshit
on vasectomies.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.315
Time's up, vasectomies.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.317
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is that?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.152
Needle.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.695
Local anesthesia.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.739
Oh, good.
I'ma need a lot of that.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.657
Uh, lots extra, please.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.868
I don't want to feel anything
from my waist down.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.077
Agh!

12:24.161 --> 12:26.830
Yeah.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.624
All right.
So what's my prognosis?

12:29.708 --> 12:30.709
The prognosis?

12:30.792 --> 12:31.793
How long am I gonna be

12:31.877 --> 12:33.003
in extraordinary pain?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.713
Oh, uh, day or two
at the most.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.298
We've already called
in a Vicodin prescription

12:36.381 --> 12:37.299
to your pharmacy,

12:37.382 --> 12:38.675
so take that as needed.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.801
All right.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.346
You feel anything
down here?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.432
Any feeling at all?

12:45.515 --> 12:47.058
No.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.393
Okay.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.395
Now just try to relax,
Mr. Ball.

12:50.479 --> 12:51.938
Is that a crack?

12:52.022 --> 12:53.607
No.
Just your name, sir.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.275
Uh, won't you make
yourself comfortable,

12:55.358 --> 12:57.652
enjoy this Muzak,
and I'll be back shortly.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.117
Okay.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.452
Now push!

13:05.535 --> 13:06.536
Are you pushing?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.121
Yes, I'm pushing!

13:09.289 --> 13:10.916
Psst!

13:10.999 --> 13:12.292
Is the coast clear?

13:12.375 --> 13:13.668
Yep.
Coast is clear.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.670
Excellent.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.714
I need some advice, Debbie.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.424
Not for me.
For a friend.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.301
- You got a sec?
- Sure, shoot.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.345
Okay.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.514
It's crowning!

13:25.597 --> 13:27.808
- You're crowning.
<i>- Awesome.</i>

13:27.891 --> 13:29.726
<i>- I'll come up and pull.</i>
- Okay.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.437
So here is
my friend's situation.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.314
She's pregnant,
and she's worried

13:34.397 --> 13:36.149
that her man
won't be there for her

13:36.233 --> 13:37.943
when her six babies come,

13:38.026 --> 13:40.487
so she's asked me
what to do.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.197
How will she know

13:42.280 --> 13:43.990
that he's really gonna
be there?

13:44.991 --> 13:47.661
Frank is not going
to be there for you.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.913
Definitely not, Ms. Jones.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.165
You should run away
with that ex-husband guy.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.583
He loves you.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.293
People change.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.296
That is the entire basis
of my therapeutic practice--

13:58.380 --> 14:00.006
that people change.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.175
Frank can change, right?

14:02.259 --> 14:05.720
No.
Times a million, no.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.014
But he seems
so committed.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.766
You could test him.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.059
For what?

14:11.142 --> 14:12.769
To see
how he really feels about you.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.271
- Oh.
- That's a good idea.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.730
Might as well.

14:15.814 --> 14:16.982
Could tell him
you have terminal cancer

14:17.065 --> 14:18.191
or are gonna die in three days,

14:18.275 --> 14:20.443
see what he says about that.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.112
Interesting.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.572
And this works?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.031
What works?

14:25.115 --> 14:26.783
Testing a man for his loyalty.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.035
How do you test a man
for loyalty, Fiona?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.120
You don't need to test.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.872
If it's got a dick,
it ain't loyal.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.583
And what's with the hole
in the floor?

14:34.666 --> 14:36.293
A little early
for a drink, isn't it?

14:37.794 --> 14:40.005
All right, Mom.
I'm gonna turn in.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.257
I'll have money for you
later today.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.843
Any chance
you could get it to me now?

14:44.926 --> 14:46.469
I gotta buy a used furnace,

14:46.553 --> 14:48.179
and bailing you out of jail
last week

14:48.263 --> 14:50.056
kind of cleaned me out.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.310
Fine.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.730
See you in 20.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.072
All right!

15:06.156 --> 15:07.949
Emiliano, KJ, Stump.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.493
This is Carl.
He's our new fry guy.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.204
This is grill, bun warmer,
and beverage.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.499
Iraq vet, ex-con,
laid off by GE.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.918
Don't call us that, Lori.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.210
Yeah, what the fuck, Lori?

15:19.294 --> 15:20.629
Be nice to this one, boys.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.297
He's never worked
on a line before.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.883
Hey, all you got to do
is follow that chart.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.053
When it says fry, you fry.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.223
All right, kid,
here's the deal.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.309
We close at 11:00 p.m.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.102
At 11:01 p.m.,

15:36.186 --> 15:39.230
we all smoke a blunt
at the picnic table out back.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.317
As fry guy,
you get to join us.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.235
Congratulations.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.410
You going
the old signage route, Frank?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.996
A bit trite, don't you think?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.559
It's true.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.728
I got kicked out
of the military

16:18.812 --> 16:21.272
'cause I couldn't get enough
of his cock.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.567
I lost a leg
to the Taliban.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.738
Did they give a shit?
No.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.616
Sent my rainbow ass packing.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.326
Our dream

16:33.410 --> 16:35.036
was to return home

16:35.120 --> 16:37.122
with two purple hearts.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.290
Instead,

16:39.374 --> 16:41.376
we're in a parking lot

16:41.459 --> 16:43.461
with nothing to show for it

16:43.545 --> 16:46.423
except our love.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.473
Thank you.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.349
Oh, thank you.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.809
Oo-rah.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.498
Hey, Jack.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.252
Thank you.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.144
Phillip Gallagher?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.605
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, you sit tight, okay?

17:43.688 --> 17:46.441
You, uh, read about the ten
best hotels of 2015.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.151
Good?
All right.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.196
Hi.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.822
Hi.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.574
<i>How can I help you?</i>

17:54.657 --> 17:55.700
<i>Uh, I want to apply</i>

17:55.784 --> 17:57.494
to foster a ten-year-old girl.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.537
Uh, foster to adopt,
as her legal guardian.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.873
- She a blood relative?
- No, but--

18:01.956 --> 18:03.291
So you're
an unlicensed non-relative.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.251
Where's her mom?
She in the system?

18:05.335 --> 18:07.337
No one knows
where her mom is.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.714
No dad in the picture?
Grandparents?

18:11.841 --> 18:13.551
Well, I'll tell you right now,
Mr. Gallagher,

18:13.635 --> 18:14.761
this process isn't set up

18:14.844 --> 18:17.347
to give a 20-something
male non-relative

18:17.430 --> 18:19.682
guardianship
of a prepubescent girl.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.310
- Sure.
- Lot of steps involved.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.812
Lot of paperwork.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.688
I, uh--I brought a pen, so...

18:28.441 --> 18:29.734
The girl you came
with--is she the child

18:29.818 --> 18:30.985
you want to foster?

18:31.069 --> 18:32.529
Yeah.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.572
Is she
already in your care,

18:34.656 --> 18:36.366
staying at your residence?

18:38.660 --> 18:41.955
She, uh--
she feels safe with me.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.791
A'ight, her mom
just up and left her.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.960
A'ight?
She has no place else to go.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.003
That's not
how this process works.

18:49.087 --> 18:52.090
You can't
just start fostering someone.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.474
Okay.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.522
All right.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.315
Um, before we get started
in here,

19:09.399 --> 19:13.069
gonna need you to sign
this liability release.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.571
If you could just sign
right down there for me.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.908
What are the chances I develop
an internal hematoma?

19:18.992 --> 19:20.535
Extremely rare.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.911
What if I piss blood tomorrow?

19:21.995 --> 19:23.288
Very rare.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.081
Okay, time to sign.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.755
Doctor will be with you
momentarily.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.570
Jesus.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.238
So we're all good there.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.990
Add "check smoke detectors"

19:59.073 --> 20:00.700
and a working furnace.
Debs!

20:00.783 --> 20:02.076
- On it!
- Great.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.663
Also, it says something
about where I sleep.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.999
Let me see.

20:08.082 --> 20:09.417
"Own bed

20:09.500 --> 20:11.920
in a room with no more
than one other person,

20:12.003 --> 20:14.672
of the same sex."

20:14.756 --> 20:17.091
Okay, uh, so maybe
I could get a bunk bed

20:17.175 --> 20:18.718
for you and Debbie?
That sounds fun, right?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.803
What?
No way.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.181
No offense.
I have Franny.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.350
All right, so I'll put
the bunk beds in Fiona's room,

20:25.433 --> 20:26.643
you two can go in there,
and Xan can have your old room.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.019
No.
I'm a grown woman.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.479
I'm not sharing a room
with Fiona.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.813
Look, she needs
to sleep somewhere, Debs!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.443
A'ight, I'm sorry.
I just...

20:35.526 --> 20:37.403
I'm trying to figure this out,
all right?

20:37.487 --> 20:38.988
I'm gonna go buy a bunk bed,

20:39.072 --> 20:41.115
and we'll just go from there,
yeah?

20:45.370 --> 20:48.206
Hey.
Mm, here.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.708
Utilities plus half
of what I owe you.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.795
Thanks again.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.463
And for my next trick,

20:55.546 --> 20:58.341
don't wake me.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.635
Is she just going to bed now?

21:09.185 --> 21:10.770
Done.
Let's roll.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.188
Already?
That was fast.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.731
Yeah, all done.
Easy-peasy.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.233
What--shouldn't we
sign you out?

21:15.316 --> 21:17.318
No, did it.
All paid, like Fandango.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.737
I'm so proud of you, baby.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.823
And then there were five,

21:21.906 --> 21:23.283
ladies and gentlemen.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.368
Yes!

21:25.451 --> 21:28.621
Five contestants remain.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.456
All right,
for the semifinals,

21:30.540 --> 21:32.125
we have a challenge
that is gonna separate

21:32.208 --> 21:34.711
the truly loco
from the mildly loco.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.504
We call it...

21:36.587 --> 21:39.132
The South Side
Emergency Room Challenge!

21:39.215 --> 21:41.009
Whoo!

21:41.092 --> 21:43.303
County General
is two blocks away

21:43.386 --> 21:44.929
on Ellis

21:45.013 --> 21:46.973
and boasts the longest

21:47.056 --> 21:48.850
emergency room waiting time

21:48.933 --> 21:51.269
in all Chicago:

21:51.811 --> 21:54.147
11 hours.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.898
Your challenge,

21:55.982 --> 21:57.567
in one hour or less,

21:57.650 --> 21:59.235
is to get seen

21:59.319 --> 22:00.862
by an ER doctor.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.239
You ever gotten through
in less than an hour?

22:03.323 --> 22:05.033
No, not possible.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.409
It's gonna take gushing blood.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.328
Amputation.

22:08.411 --> 22:11.331
Grand mal seizure.
Aw.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.958
Can I get one hour
on the clock, please?

22:14.042 --> 22:15.251
Oh...
All right.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.878
And...

22:16.961 --> 22:18.379
Go!

22:26.054 --> 22:28.181
Yo, Brad, hey.
Hey, man,

22:28.264 --> 22:30.308
could I borrow a socket set?

22:30.391 --> 22:31.809
I got a bunk bed
getting delivered.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.269
Take whatever you need.
Yeah.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.854
Thanks, man.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.230
I miss a party, or...

22:36.314 --> 22:37.440
Uh, not a party.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.858
Uh, just some refined sugar

22:38.941 --> 22:40.485
in honor of Jay Z over there.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.070
Jay Z?

22:42.153 --> 22:43.654
I'm 100 days tomorrow!

22:43.738 --> 22:45.198
No shit!
Yo!

22:45.281 --> 22:46.407
Hey, man, I'm so sorry.

22:46.491 --> 22:47.867
Fuck, I must have forgot.
Yo.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.577
That's no joke, all right?

22:49.660 --> 22:51.454
What can I say?
I got a good sponsor.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.247
You know what?
We'll hit the 8:00 a.m.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.582
tomorrow morning and get
some pie and celebrate, okay?

22:54.665 --> 22:57.460
- Sounds good.
- All right, good.

22:57.543 --> 23:00.254
Hey, go ahead.
Have a cupcake.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.507
Hey, man.
Um...

23:02.590 --> 23:04.926
Cami say anything to you
about Tami?

23:05.009 --> 23:06.135
What about Tami?

23:06.219 --> 23:07.637
I don't know.
She's acting funny.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.888
She was supposed to pick us up

23:08.971 --> 23:09.972
this morning--never showed.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.600
I didn't hear anything.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.936
Maybe she's not cool
with the whole Xan thing.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.687
I mean, it's one thing
to start dating a guy,

23:16.771 --> 23:18.064
but it's another thing
to start dating

23:18.147 --> 23:19.857
a dad with a preteen.

23:19.941 --> 23:22.276
What's she been saying
about it?

23:22.360 --> 23:23.986
Oh, nothing.
I mean...

23:24.070 --> 23:26.030
I don't know.
I guess I didn't really ask.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.449
Women like
to be asked everything.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.118
I don't buy 1% milk
instead of 2%

23:30.201 --> 23:31.536
without asking Cami.

23:31.619 --> 23:32.870
What, you think
she's gonna make me choose

23:32.954 --> 23:34.956
between her and Xan?
That--that's crazy.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.916
I don't know,
but you gotta ask.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.751
Just ask, pretend-listen,
and nod.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.044
Works every time.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.801
Okay girls, here we go.

23:46.884 --> 23:50.346
Here we go, honey.
Okay.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.683
Oh...

23:53.766 --> 23:55.059
Oh, you okay, honey?

23:55.143 --> 23:56.477
Oh...

23:58.271 --> 24:02.442
Oh, the pain.

24:02.525 --> 24:05.903
The pain is still so much.
It's <i>mucho.</i>

24:05.987 --> 24:08.239
<i>- Muy mucho</i> pain.
- Oh.

24:08.322 --> 24:09.866
The painkillers
haven't kicked in yet?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.075
Yeah, I...

24:11.159 --> 24:12.952
...am answer questions.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.787
Wow.
Okay.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.289
I'll get you some ice.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.708
You gotta ice it today
every 20 minutes.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.668
20 minutes on,
20 minutes off.

24:20.751 --> 24:21.752
You hear me?

24:21.836 --> 24:23.254
Ah.

24:23.337 --> 24:24.714
You guys want me
to make you

24:24.797 --> 24:26.507
a snack
before I go to work today?

24:26.591 --> 24:28.176
Yes!

24:28.259 --> 24:30.136
Kev?

24:30.219 --> 24:33.931
Kevin.
Hey, hey, hey.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.975
Are you gonna be okay
watching the girls today?

24:36.058 --> 24:38.561
Mm, yes, nachos.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.063
Extra guac

24:41.147 --> 24:42.648
and sour cream.

24:42.732 --> 24:45.026
Shit.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.154
Hey, Deb.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.114
Kev had a minor
medical procedure this morning.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.657
He's not up
to watching the girls.

24:51.741 --> 24:52.909
Can you watch them
for a few hours

24:52.992 --> 24:54.160
while I run to the Alibi?

24:54.243 --> 24:55.661
Yeah, sure.
No problem.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.205
Just throw them in
the Pack 'n Play with Franny.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.873
I have her watching cartoons
till we're done here.

24:58.956 --> 24:59.999
Thanks, girl.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.125
Cute furnace.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.211
Only cost me
700 bucks.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.929
I got a fork
in my leg!

25:13.012 --> 25:14.931
I need to see
a doctor!

25:15.014 --> 25:17.767
I'm suicidal.
I'm going to do it.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.395
- I'm really--
- You ready?

25:21.479 --> 25:23.231
I'm really
gonna do it.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.565
- There you go.
- I'm serious.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.776
I'm--
I'm so suicidal.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.530
I'm going to do it.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.490
Oh, wow.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.325
Ready?

25:37.411 --> 25:38.871
Okay.

25:45.002 --> 25:47.755
You go.

25:47.838 --> 25:50.132
Excuse me.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.093
Excuse me.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.472
My friend and I have
this cough.

25:56.556 --> 25:58.849
- It just won't--
- Code red. TB alert.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.184
I think he's got a--

26:00.268 --> 26:01.352
Yes, sir.
One second.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.479
TB protocol!
Get them to quarantine!

26:03.563 --> 26:05.189
You're being admitted.
There are some wheelchairs

26:05.273 --> 26:07.066
here for you right now.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.568
Sir, if you could just have
a seat.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.069
Get them to isolation
right away!

26:10.152 --> 26:12.822
We'll take you back
to see the doctor.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.616
Let's get them
to quarantine.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.376
<i>Could someone
get that, for fuck's sake?</i>

26:29.297 --> 26:33.551
Oh, God.
Keep your fucking pants on.

26:38.306 --> 26:39.724
- What?
- Hi.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.018
I'm Peter Naylor,
here to see Phillip Gallagher.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.561
- He at home?
- Lip!

26:44.729 --> 26:45.896
You home?

26:48.858 --> 26:49.859
Guess not.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.695
What about Alexandra Galvez?

26:52.778 --> 26:53.988
She in?

26:54.071 --> 26:55.114
Who?

26:55.197 --> 26:57.491
Alexandra Galvez.
G-A-L-V-E-Z.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.327
Female, age ten,
African-American.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.830
Oh, Xan?
That her name?

27:02.913 --> 27:06.083
Uh, I'm sorry.
I was sound asleep.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.544
Yeah, Xan crashes here
sometimes.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.796
- Why?
- I'm with DCFS,

27:10.880 --> 27:12.256
here to do
a home safety check

27:12.340 --> 27:14.467
for a case opened up
by Phillip Gallagher.

27:16.385 --> 27:17.803
Oh.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.972
May I come in?

27:21.766 --> 27:22.933
Sure.

27:30.441 --> 27:33.027
We're just doing a few, uh,
home improvement projects

27:33.110 --> 27:34.445
- today.
- Hmm.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.238
Your tetanus is up to date,
right?

27:38.783 --> 27:40.576
Is that an open hole
in the floor?

27:42.370 --> 27:45.665
Uh, yes, but it's not
what it appears to be.

27:45.748 --> 27:49.043
My sister is actually a welder,
so she's very qualified to--

27:49.126 --> 27:51.671
uh, Debs, can you come
down here, please?

27:55.257 --> 27:57.301
Who's in charge
of these children?

27:57.385 --> 27:59.887
Um, Debbie.
Debbie is.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.098
Uh, the woman you can't find?

28:02.181 --> 28:03.599
Uh, well,
she's definitely here.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.851
She's just probably
getting a tool or something.

28:05.935 --> 28:08.521
Debs!
Can you come down here, please?

28:08.604 --> 28:10.022
Are you here?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.484
Uh, it doesn't seem
like Debs is here.

28:13.567 --> 28:14.652
Hmm.

28:14.735 --> 28:17.321
Well, also, I was--
I was here.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.740
I was right upstairs,
so if the kids needed anything,

28:19.824 --> 28:21.492
I--I would've heard them
and come running.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.494
Weren't you sound asleep?

28:24.870 --> 28:27.415
Uh--
Yes.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.958
Mm.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.626
And where
does Alexandra sleep?

28:31.585 --> 28:34.380
Uh, on the couch,
most of the time, I think.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.385
We take really good care
of her.

28:43.931 --> 28:44.932
Upstairs?

28:45.015 --> 28:46.016
Why not?

28:46.100 --> 28:47.518
Of course.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.941
Oh, we did it!

28:54.024 --> 28:55.151
Got it done.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.278
New furnace, boy!

28:59.238 --> 29:00.489
Oh, I'm parched.

29:00.573 --> 29:01.782
Can I drink out of that?

29:01.866 --> 29:02.908
Yeah, sure.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.285
Let me turn it on.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.172
Oh, see, there's Debs.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.882
I knew she was here.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.216
Debs!

29:19.300 --> 29:20.509
There she is.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.052
Hey, Debbie?

29:22.136 --> 29:23.721
W-would you come
in here, please?

29:23.804 --> 29:25.181
Why?

29:25.264 --> 29:27.683
It's fine.
We're all set here.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.477
Um...

29:32.730 --> 29:34.023
<i>No, you bitch!</i>

29:34.106 --> 29:35.483
If you can just wait
a moment...

29:35.566 --> 29:36.817
She--she was just outside,

29:36.901 --> 29:40.112
and, see, this is
her daughter here, Francis.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.072
Oh, Phillip, good.

29:42.156 --> 29:43.157
This is, um...

29:43.240 --> 29:44.658
Peter.

29:44.742 --> 29:46.660
Uh, he's here
for the house check.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.537
Oh, hey, hey.

29:48.621 --> 29:49.914
Peter, how's it going, man?

29:49.997 --> 29:51.332
I'm Phillip.
It's--it's very nice

29:51.415 --> 29:53.501
to meet you, sir.
Um...

29:53.584 --> 29:55.419
I wasn't expecting you here
so soon.

29:55.503 --> 29:56.629
Unannounced.

29:56.712 --> 29:58.255
Right, um...

29:58.339 --> 30:01.467
Well, I'm here now, so, uh,
how about I take over

30:01.550 --> 30:03.052
and I'll--I'll give you
the tour, then?

30:03.135 --> 30:05.012
Miss Gallagher
already showed me around.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.597
She did.
Okay.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.682
Um, hey, hey,
I'm sure you're, uh,

30:08.766 --> 30:09.975
a really busy guy,
but, you know,

30:10.059 --> 30:11.393
maybe just give me
a couple minutes.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.770
I can show you around.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.480
You know, explain
a couple things.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.232
I got
two more appointments today.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.983
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.319
Look, just come back
in a couple hours, all right?

30:20.402 --> 30:22.780
Please, I-I just got her
a comforter.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.240
All right?
I-I got her a bunk bed coming.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.408
Sorry.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.743
I'm done here.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.186
Ahoy, mateys.

30:54.270 --> 30:55.729
Break's over.
Come on.

30:55.813 --> 30:57.565
Hey, yo, can I ask you guys
something real quick?

30:57.648 --> 30:58.774
- Sure.
- Yeah.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.693
What do you think
this picture's of?

31:02.361 --> 31:05.030
It's easy.
It's hot, is what it is.

31:05.114 --> 31:07.449
Two fucking hot lesbians
being fucking hot.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.368
Yeah, lesbian porn.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.452
My dick's hard.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.537
Yo, that's my sister

31:11.620 --> 31:12.621
and my girlfriend.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.123
- No way.
- Fuck you.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.584
Which one's your sister?

31:16.667 --> 31:19.003
Uh, she's macking
on your girl, huh?

31:23.591 --> 31:25.384
Hey, hey.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.469
Why the hell'd you let DCFS
in here?

31:27.553 --> 31:28.554
I'm sorry.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.431
I had no idea who that guy was.
I-I didn't--

31:30.514 --> 31:32.182
Who the fuck did you think
that was?

31:32.266 --> 31:33.851
He's wearing a tie and he's got
a fucking clipboard.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.729
I was asleep!
I'm not a fucking mind reader.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.397
Why didn't you tell me
they were coming?

31:38.480 --> 31:39.481
- Why didn't I tell you?
- Yes.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.483
Maybe if I'd known DCFS
was dropping by--

31:41.567 --> 31:43.110
Jesus Christ.
Do you have any idea

31:43.193 --> 31:44.403
how much you fucked this up
for me?

31:44.486 --> 31:46.030
This is not my fault.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.657
- I did not invite DCFS here.
- Hey, hey, shh.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.534
I did not leave a--a furnace
in the house...

31:50.618 --> 31:52.494
- Hey, hey, hey!
- ...Or kids in a Pack 'n Play,

31:52.578 --> 31:54.955
or an open hole
in the fucking floor.

31:55.039 --> 31:56.582
No, but you sure as shit
didn't help, Fiona.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.167
The old Fiona
would've handled this,

31:58.250 --> 31:59.793
would've spun shit,
would've covered for me.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.295
What was I supposed to do, huh?

32:01.378 --> 32:02.421
Bake him a fucking cake?

32:02.504 --> 32:03.505
No, but I expected you

32:03.589 --> 32:05.132
to not be drunk
in the middle of the day.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.342
How about that, huh?

32:18.854 --> 32:20.189
Maybe I'm tired

32:20.272 --> 32:22.942
of playing
Susie fucking Sunshine

32:23.025 --> 32:25.361
all the time, huh?
Think of that?

32:28.697 --> 32:30.574
'Cause if I want to be drunk

32:30.658 --> 32:31.951
in the middle
of the fucking day,

32:32.034 --> 32:33.869
that is my fucking business.

33:06.944 --> 33:09.029
<i>We are very lucky to have
Camilla back with us today...</i>

33:09.113 --> 33:11.323
Why can't we watch the game?
This sucks.

33:11.407 --> 33:13.158
Where's Kevin?

33:13.242 --> 33:14.702
Kev had a vasectomy today.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.203
- Ooh.
- Poor bastard.

33:16.286 --> 33:17.746
Worst day of my life.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.248
I know, but it was time,

33:19.331 --> 33:20.833
with Santiago,
and, of course,

33:20.916 --> 33:22.918
me telling him it was time.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.628
They warn him
about the pooling?

33:24.712 --> 33:26.839
- You had blood pooling, too?
- Ah.

33:26.922 --> 33:29.008
They had to drain me
like a pig down there.

33:29.091 --> 33:31.343
You have to be nice
to the old boy, V.

33:31.427 --> 33:33.345
He's going through
some serious torture

33:33.429 --> 33:35.681
down there.

33:37.099 --> 33:39.351
Alibi.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.937
The who?

33:42.021 --> 33:43.272
Reschedule what?

33:45.315 --> 33:46.775
What do you mean,
he didn't have it?

33:46.859 --> 33:48.318
He's at home right now,
recovering.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.612
He said his pain level's a te--

33:50.696 --> 33:53.282

34:32.279 --> 34:35.199
Hey, Tami, um,

34:35.282 --> 34:37.534
it's me.
Uh...

34:37.618 --> 34:38.994
Look, I'm--I'm sure you're--

34:39.078 --> 34:40.704
you're probably getting
off work soon.

34:40.788 --> 34:43.916
Uh, I'm about to hit a meeting,

34:43.999 --> 34:48.253
um, you know, 'cause I, uh--

34:50.297 --> 34:51.965
I need a meeting.

34:52.049 --> 34:53.717
Uh...

34:54.718 --> 34:57.471
Actually, I had a--
a pretty shitty day,

34:57.554 --> 34:59.181
to be honest.

35:01.308 --> 35:02.768
So...

35:03.435 --> 35:05.687
Yeah, just call me back,
all right?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.064
Thanks.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.487
Hello, I'm home.

35:13.570 --> 35:14.696
Hey.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.199
Hey!

35:17.282 --> 35:18.700
Hey, Carl,
we're in here.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.369
We're in the kitchen!

35:20.452 --> 35:22.204
We got muffins, y'all!

35:22.287 --> 35:24.915
Muffins! Muffins! Muffins!

35:24.998 --> 35:26.792
The best.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.419
Carl, your sister
is so fucking funny.

35:29.503 --> 35:30.796
What's so funny?

35:30.879 --> 35:33.215
Oh, it's an inside joke.
You wouldn't get it.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.925
It's a muffin commercial.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.719
You know the fat guy
from the muffin commercial?

35:37.803 --> 35:40.013
"We got muffins, y'all!"

35:41.682 --> 35:43.058
Stop.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.729
Oh, I'm gonna run up
and get dressed.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.064
D, can I borrow
something to wear?

35:49.148 --> 35:50.774
Of course, girl.
Take whatever.

35:50.858 --> 35:51.984
Do you want
to split another with me,

35:52.067 --> 35:53.152
or you want your own
when you're back?

35:53.235 --> 35:54.236
Split with you.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.654
Be right back, fry guy.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.364
I'm so proud of you.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.202
The fuck you think
you're doing?

36:02.286 --> 36:03.745
Putting peanut butter
on a Ritz.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.998
No, with Kelly.
Why you trying to get with her?

36:06.081 --> 36:08.083
- What?
- Stop fronting.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.501
I'm not fronting.

36:09.585 --> 36:11.003
Her and I just get along good.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.171
Aren't I supposed
to get along well

36:12.254 --> 36:14.464
with my brother's girlfriend
if she's awesome?

36:14.548 --> 36:16.925
No, she's my awesome,
not your awesome.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.760
She's not a lesbian, dumbass.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.345
Exactly.
She's not gay.

36:20.429 --> 36:22.014
Although she is
the kind of girl

36:22.097 --> 36:23.765
who could come out
later in life.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.142
I'm not getting
total gay vibes,

36:25.225 --> 36:27.978
but it's inconclusive,
so...I'd say yeah,

36:28.061 --> 36:30.230
she'll probably eventually
end up gay.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.025
Just knock it off.
I mean it.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.527
There's nothing going on
between me and your girlfriend.

36:35.611 --> 36:37.196
Keep your blouse on, Carl.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.489
You guys know where, uh,
Lip went?

36:39.573 --> 36:40.699
No.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.367
Well, he's not answering
his phone.

36:42.451 --> 36:43.660
I gotta find him.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.748
Hey, Xan, do you know
where Lip might be?

36:47.831 --> 36:49.374
Maybe the shop?

36:49.458 --> 36:51.668
All right, thanks.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.881
- Hey, Mikey.
- Yeah, Frank?

36:55.964 --> 36:57.966
No matter what
the final challenge is, buddy,

36:58.050 --> 37:00.135
I-I just want you to know

37:00.219 --> 37:02.387
you've been a pleasure
to work with.

37:02.471 --> 37:03.722
You're a hobo

37:03.805 --> 37:04.806
from another mother.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.601
Thanks for that.
Thank you, Frank.

37:07.684 --> 37:10.187
Couldn't have said that better
myself.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.732
All right, let's get started!

37:16.026 --> 37:19.696
From hundreds of hopefuls
to dozens of competitors,

37:19.780 --> 37:24.576
to eight finalists
to six valiant losers...

37:26.119 --> 37:29.998
...And finally, finally,
to two final hobos.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.417
We've come
to the last round,

37:32.501 --> 37:35.754
where Frank and Mikey
will compete <i>mano y mano,</i>

37:35.837 --> 37:37.923
but the question is,

37:38.006 --> 37:40.759
who will wear
the Hobo Loco crown?

37:43.178 --> 37:44.721
- Hold on.
- That'll be me.

37:50.811 --> 37:52.562
Was that a train?

37:52.646 --> 37:54.982
Oh, man, I hate trains.

37:55.065 --> 37:56.400
That's right!

37:56.483 --> 37:59.903
When you think
of the classic American hobo,

37:59.987 --> 38:01.613
what is he doing?

38:01.697 --> 38:04.199
Jumping on a moving train!

38:07.035 --> 38:09.204
The train

38:09.288 --> 38:12.332
will barrel down on Frank
and Mikey

38:12.416 --> 38:15.127
and you two will run like hell

38:15.210 --> 38:16.211
to hop on.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.171
The hobo who is in the car

38:18.255 --> 38:20.215
when the train
crosses the finish line

38:20.299 --> 38:23.176
is our winner, but first,

38:23.260 --> 38:24.886
four shots each!

38:24.970 --> 38:27.264
Loco up!

38:40.110 --> 38:42.696
You came!
My baby.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.448
Oh, God.

38:44.531 --> 38:46.658
Frank, something's wrong.
I'm in pain.

38:46.742 --> 38:47.784
What do you mean?

38:47.868 --> 38:49.244
I'm cramping and I'm spotting

38:49.328 --> 38:50.912
and there's a lot of blood.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.749
I think I'm having between one
and six miscarriages.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.584
Right now?
Oh, God.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.169
- Uh...
- Yeah, look, I-I need you

38:57.252 --> 38:59.212
to come home.
Care for me.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.715
Frank.

39:01.798 --> 39:02.841
Okay.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.301
Here's the plan.
You pop a squat

39:04.384 --> 39:05.594
right here
for just a few minutes.

39:05.677 --> 39:06.595
- I will--
- Pop a squat?

39:06.678 --> 39:07.637
Or--or sit on those

39:07.721 --> 39:08.972
very comfortable benches,

39:09.056 --> 39:10.640
and I will be back momentarily.

39:10.724 --> 39:12.434
This'll take three,
maybe five minutes.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.061
I am miscarrying.

39:14.144 --> 39:16.980
Will you come with me,
or will you stay?

39:17.064 --> 39:18.815
Frank, four shots,

39:18.899 --> 39:20.567
or you're disqualified.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.402
Come with me, Frank.
Come.

39:25.072 --> 39:27.115
I'm coming!

39:27.199 --> 39:29.242
I will be back.
I love you.

39:29.326 --> 39:30.577
I'm gonna win this.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.037
I'll be back.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.955
There he goes.
There he goes.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.248
Okay!
Whoo!

39:35.332 --> 39:37.793
Oh, like nothing!

39:45.509 --> 39:46.593
Hello?

39:46.676 --> 39:48.970
Hey.
We, uh--we shut down at 5:00.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.389
Closing up here.
Can I help you?

39:50.472 --> 39:51.723
Hi.
Um...

39:51.807 --> 39:53.016
I'm looking for my brother,
Lip.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.684
- Is he here?
- You're Lip's sister?

39:54.768 --> 39:56.561
- Yeah.
- No way. I'm Jason.

39:56.645 --> 39:57.896
- Hi.
- Your brother's a great guy.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.398
Yeah, he is.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.983
He's not here, though.
Nobody here but me.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.276
You want me to text him
and tell him--

40:03.360 --> 40:06.029
No, no.
I think he's avoiding me

40:06.113 --> 40:08.782
'cause I fucked something up
for him.

40:08.865 --> 40:11.368
I owe him an apology.

40:11.451 --> 40:14.413
Apparently, I owe everyone
an apology.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.832
Well, you can talk to me
about it.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.667
You know, if you want to.

40:22.504 --> 40:26.007
Shit is going down, Jason--

40:26.091 --> 40:27.592
God--

40:27.676 --> 40:30.470
in my life.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.977
I'm broke...

40:39.438 --> 40:42.524
...back home,

40:42.607 --> 40:45.235
and my boyfriend's married.

40:45.318 --> 40:48.447
I got fired
from the place that I managed.

40:50.282 --> 40:51.992
Probably heard all
that before, right?

40:52.075 --> 40:53.785
Lip comes in
whining about me.

40:53.869 --> 40:55.412
He doesn't, no.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.332
Liar.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.879
I went to jail, too.
Yeah.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.299
Assault charges.
Punched a racist.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.969
Court date coming up.

41:12.554 --> 41:15.724
And I sold drugs today.

41:16.850 --> 41:18.685
That was fun.

41:22.022 --> 41:24.608
And I'm just
in a really fucked-up place.

41:27.194 --> 41:29.279
You ever been
in a fucked-up place?

41:33.033 --> 41:34.034
Yeah.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.577
Hmm.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.953
See?

41:37.037 --> 41:39.915
You know
what I'm talking about.

41:42.501 --> 41:45.337
So many motorcycles in here.

41:46.296 --> 41:48.965
No one get tired
of looking at them?

41:52.844 --> 41:54.513
You mind?

41:56.306 --> 41:57.849
Oh, yeah, sure.
Go.

41:57.933 --> 41:59.559
Fuck. Sorry.
That's so rude.

41:59.643 --> 42:01.186
Yeah.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.522
Go get yourself a cup.

42:09.319 --> 42:13.281
I taught myself
to ride a bike, by the way.

42:13.365 --> 42:15.200
The kind you pedal.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.078
I taught Lip, too.

42:18.161 --> 42:20.038
He doesn't remember that now.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.623
I taught him...

42:24.876 --> 42:27.420
And I taught Debbie and Carl

42:27.504 --> 42:30.131
and Ian and Liam.

42:45.897 --> 42:46.982
Hey.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.441
It's not bad.

42:48.525 --> 42:50.110
Lip.
Hey.

42:50.193 --> 42:51.486
Hey.
I-I've been texting

42:51.570 --> 42:53.196
and--and calling all day.

42:53.280 --> 42:57.284
Uh, now is not
a great time.

42:57.367 --> 42:59.077
Look, is this about Xan?

42:59.160 --> 43:00.704
And what, you--
you just don't show up, or--

43:00.787 --> 43:02.247
Okay, slow your roll,
all right?

43:02.330 --> 43:03.582
Uh, you guys go ahead.

43:03.665 --> 43:05.834
- I'll catch up.
- Okay.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.003
I've had
a really shitty day, all right?

43:08.086 --> 43:09.629
DCFS showed up unannounced.

43:09.713 --> 43:11.381
Fiona answered the door
fucking drunk.

43:11.464 --> 43:12.632
I mean...

43:15.677 --> 43:16.803
What is this?

43:18.513 --> 43:20.348
Why--why are you sending me
to voicemail?

43:22.267 --> 43:23.518
This isn't about you.

43:23.602 --> 43:25.520
So what,
you're just pissed, then,

43:25.604 --> 43:27.272
that I'm trying to foster Xan?

43:27.355 --> 43:29.232
I mean, is it so crazy
that--that I'd want

43:29.316 --> 43:30.650
to make someone's life
any better?

43:30.734 --> 43:32.402
Okay, I'm pregnant.

43:37.490 --> 43:40.160
I realized it this morning
in the shower.

43:40.243 --> 43:42.495
I'm late.

43:42.579 --> 43:45.165
So I left your house,
I got a test,

43:45.248 --> 43:47.667
and I saw the...

43:47.751 --> 43:50.712
...biggest, bluest plus sign
I've ever seen,

43:50.795 --> 43:54.257
and so I went back to CVS,
got another test.

43:54.799 --> 43:56.217
Positive.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.597
You sure it's mine?

44:01.640 --> 44:04.476
Yeah, I'm sure it's yours.

44:04.559 --> 44:06.603
I make Boone wear a condom.
He's been in the Philippines.

44:06.686 --> 44:08.396
I double-bag that shit.

44:09.481 --> 44:11.316
What are you gonna do?

44:11.399 --> 44:14.361
We.
What are we gonna do?

44:15.278 --> 44:17.322
I don't know.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.032
Um...

44:25.246 --> 44:26.498
Shit.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.750
My Uber's here.
I gotta go.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.043
Hey, hey.
No, no,

44:30.126 --> 44:31.878
we--we have to talk
about this, right?

44:37.676 --> 44:39.344
Well, can I--
can I call you later?

44:39.427 --> 44:41.137
Yeah, uh,
if you want to call me,

44:41.221 --> 44:43.807
that's cool,
but if you don't...

44:43.890 --> 44:45.975
I gotta go.

44:48.353 --> 44:49.813
Hey.

45:03.076 --> 45:04.911
Hey, man, I'm--I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

45:04.994 --> 45:06.329
Can I call you back?

45:09.416 --> 45:11.626
W-w-what happened?

45:12.252 --> 45:14.671
That train is coming in fast,

45:14.754 --> 45:16.715
and we're supposed to run

45:16.798 --> 45:19.259
and jump on that thing?

45:19.342 --> 45:23.138
One man's...fast
is another man's slow.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.597
Maybe we should go in on it

45:24.681 --> 45:26.558
together, though,
like compadres.

45:26.641 --> 45:28.518
First one up helps the other.

45:28.977 --> 45:30.562
We split the money.

45:30.645 --> 45:31.980
You're just saying that

45:32.063 --> 45:34.399
because you're in worse shape
than my liver.

45:34.482 --> 45:38.194
No, Frank,
I genuinely like you!

45:38.278 --> 45:39.863
You're my best friend!

45:39.946 --> 45:43.241
There's no "we" in "win,"
O'Shea.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.036
It's time.

45:52.876 --> 45:55.712
Go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

45:59.007 --> 46:01.342
Yo, Frank, wait for me!
Man!

46:01.426 --> 46:03.511
That's it?
That's all you've go--

46:06.848 --> 46:09.809
Yeah!
Yeah!

46:09.893 --> 46:11.686
Yeah--no!

46:16.399 --> 46:17.942
Not without me, Frank,

46:18.026 --> 46:20.153
you motherfucker!

46:21.738 --> 46:23.782
Get off of me!
Jesus.

46:23.865 --> 46:25.784
I wanna win!

46:25.867 --> 46:28.912
- Frank!
- Jesus.

46:30.997 --> 46:33.792
Oh, no.
That's the finish line,

46:33.875 --> 46:35.960
and neither hobo
reached the train.

46:36.044 --> 46:38.129
Okay.

46:38.213 --> 46:41.883
Okay.
Thank you, Frank.

46:41.966 --> 46:43.718
Thank you.

46:43.802 --> 46:46.054
Oh, what the fuck?

46:46.137 --> 46:47.972
Great job, kids.

46:48.056 --> 46:49.766
Oh, boy, that was some event.

46:49.849 --> 46:51.684
I'll just take this
right off your hands.

46:51.768 --> 46:53.353
Actually there's--
there's been a development,

46:53.436 --> 46:55.313
Frank, if you could just--
just hold.

46:55.396 --> 46:56.815
Hold?
I'll just hold

46:56.898 --> 46:58.775
this big fat check
I just won.

46:58.858 --> 47:00.735
In the event
that no one wins

47:00.819 --> 47:02.153
the final event, the hobo
with the largest

47:02.237 --> 47:04.113
social media following wins.

47:04.197 --> 47:05.406
- Gloria!
- Gloria!

47:05.490 --> 47:06.491
Congratulations!

47:06.574 --> 47:08.201
Are you fucking kidding me?

47:08.284 --> 47:10.036
She posed topless with fans.

47:10.119 --> 47:11.830
You--you can't compete
with--with titties.

47:11.913 --> 47:15.875
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Hobo Loco Man is...

47:15.959 --> 47:17.126
Gloria!

47:28.346 --> 47:29.722
Fuck.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.875
Hey, what's all this?

47:56.958 --> 47:58.418
Movie night.
Say what?

47:58.501 --> 48:00.378
Taking a popcorn break.

48:00.461 --> 48:01.963
Hey.
I was thinking, you know,

48:02.046 --> 48:04.090
maybe you and I could go
spend some time upstairs.

48:04.966 --> 48:06.718
Already?
It's--it's early.

48:06.801 --> 48:07.927
I was thinking, you know,

48:08.011 --> 48:09.304
maybe you and I
could just hang out.

48:09.387 --> 48:10.555
I'm fresh out of the shower.

48:10.638 --> 48:11.890
Want some butter, Kell?

48:11.973 --> 48:13.308
Does the pope
wear a funny hat?

48:13.391 --> 48:15.059
Uh-huh.

48:15.143 --> 48:16.895
W-why don't you watch
the movie with us?

48:16.978 --> 48:18.271
We're watching <i>Showgirls.</i>

48:18.354 --> 48:19.480
You're watching <i>Showgirls</i>?

48:19.564 --> 48:21.149
Yeah.
She's never seen it before.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.734
The old brunette is being
such a good mentor

48:22.817 --> 48:23.818
to the young blonde one.

48:23.902 --> 48:24.903
- I know.
- Okay.

48:24.986 --> 48:26.404
Kell, I'ma head upstairs
right now.

48:26.487 --> 48:27.864
I'd really like
if you came with me.

48:27.947 --> 48:28.948
No way.

48:29.032 --> 48:31.284
She needs to see
how it ends.

48:31.367 --> 48:33.202
I know how it ends.

48:46.633 --> 48:47.800
Hey.

48:47.884 --> 48:48.885
Hey.

48:48.968 --> 48:50.053
Hey, man.
Hey.

48:50.136 --> 48:51.763
Hey.
You all right?

48:51.846 --> 48:53.014
You all right?

48:53.097 --> 48:55.141
I'm so sorry, man.

48:55.224 --> 48:57.018
I fucked up.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.311
Don't be sorry.
It's okay.

48:58.394 --> 48:59.687
All right?
We all slip.

48:59.771 --> 49:01.189
Not like this, man.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.524
100 days I just flushed
down the drain.

49:03.608 --> 49:06.653
Just like I did one time.
Right?

49:06.736 --> 49:08.738
Brad fucked up, too.
We all have, a'ight?

49:08.821 --> 49:10.156
It's not important.

49:10.239 --> 49:11.282
Okay?
What's important

49:11.366 --> 49:13.284
is that you get back up again.

49:13.368 --> 49:15.536
I don't even remember
what happened.

49:17.246 --> 49:18.998
It just took over me.

49:22.502 --> 49:24.128
Your sister had vodka,

49:24.212 --> 49:26.714
and all of a sudden,
I'm drinking it.

49:27.966 --> 49:29.425
Next thing I know,
I'm calling my guy

49:29.509 --> 49:30.677
and shooting up.

49:41.354 --> 49:42.855
You said my sister.

49:45.149 --> 49:47.694
Fiona came by the shop
looking for you.

49:49.153 --> 49:52.031
Wasn't her fault, man.
It was mine.

49:52.115 --> 49:53.783
I asked her for it.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.791
Fiona gave you vodka?

50:01.874 --> 50:03.418
It's on me.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.586
It's not on her, a'ight?

50:05.670 --> 50:07.630
I'm a fucking piece of shit
waste of space.

50:07.714 --> 50:09.465
Hey, hey, hey.
No.

50:10.633 --> 50:13.511
You're a good guy, a'ight?
You're good.

50:13.594 --> 50:15.805
- You are good.
- No.

50:18.057 --> 50:20.309
I'm so sorry.

50:21.728 --> 50:22.729
It's all right.

50:22.812 --> 50:24.105
I'm so sorry.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.566
It's all right.
That's okay. That's okay.

50:26.649 --> 50:28.651
It's all right.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.659
All right, girls,
go upstairs and play.

50:36.743 --> 50:38.786
Daddy had a major surgery

50:38.870 --> 50:40.329
and we need to give him
some time to rest.

50:40.413 --> 50:42.957
Yeah, I'm sorry, girls.
I'm a little out of commission.

50:43.041 --> 50:44.751
I just got to get
my strength back, though.

50:44.834 --> 50:46.044
I love you!

50:46.836 --> 50:49.255
How you doing, babe?
What's your pain level?

50:49.338 --> 50:50.923
Oh...

50:51.007 --> 50:53.593
- 12.
- Oh, my goodness!

50:53.676 --> 50:55.762
You're so brave.

50:55.845 --> 50:57.263
Thank you.

50:57.346 --> 50:58.973
Is that the stuff
to make my hot wings?

50:59.057 --> 51:00.641
Yes, that is the stuff

51:00.725 --> 51:03.019
to make
your homemade hot wings.

51:03.102 --> 51:05.772
Gonna take me
about two or three hours.

51:05.855 --> 51:07.899
It's a long time
of being on your feet

51:07.982 --> 51:09.567
after a full day of work,
but--

51:09.650 --> 51:12.028
Mmm, that sounds amazing.
Thank you.

51:14.280 --> 51:16.074
I should probably look at it.

51:17.742 --> 51:18.785
What?

51:18.868 --> 51:20.286
The wound.

51:20.369 --> 51:22.330
Make sure
it's not getting infected.

51:24.832 --> 51:26.209
You know,

51:26.292 --> 51:28.503
it's no need to, because--

51:28.586 --> 51:29.962
I already checked it earlier.

51:30.046 --> 51:31.047
Um, it's--it's fine.

51:31.130 --> 51:32.131
It's all good.

51:32.215 --> 51:33.216
Checked the stitches.

51:33.299 --> 51:34.300
I can tell.

51:34.383 --> 51:36.010
You gotta be safe.

51:36.094 --> 51:37.512
Don't be shy.

51:39.013 --> 51:43.434
You know, I've been having
nachos all day, so...

51:43.518 --> 51:45.311
...I got a lot of gas
going on down there.

51:45.394 --> 51:47.146
You don't want anything.

51:47.230 --> 51:50.066
Don't be nervous, Kev...

51:50.149 --> 51:51.234
...unless there's something
you're not telling me.

51:51.317 --> 51:52.401
Agh!
Okay, okay, okay, fine!

51:52.485 --> 51:54.737
I didn't get a vasectomy.
I pretended to

51:54.821 --> 51:57.365
while taking Vicodin all day,
and I was masturbating,

51:57.448 --> 52:00.409
and I learned to do
one of the dances on Fortnite.

52:00.493 --> 52:01.994
I'm the devil himself.

52:02.078 --> 52:03.871
I'll reschedule
the vasectomy right now.

52:03.955 --> 52:05.832
- Ow.
- You're damn right you will.

52:05.915 --> 52:07.625
Fuck!

52:09.043 --> 52:11.337
God.

52:13.089 --> 52:15.174
You're still making
the wings, though, right?

52:20.054 --> 52:22.682
Oh, hey, wait a minute.

52:22.765 --> 52:24.308
You're leaving?

52:25.351 --> 52:27.436
Well, of course I'm leaving.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.188
What did you think
would happen?

52:29.272 --> 52:31.232
It was a test, you idiot,

52:31.315 --> 52:32.400
and you failed.

52:32.483 --> 52:33.651
A test?

52:33.734 --> 52:34.819
Yeah.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.404
I didn't miscarry.

52:36.487 --> 52:39.615
I was testing you
to see if you gave a shit,

52:39.699 --> 52:40.783
and you don't.

52:40.867 --> 52:43.369
So now you're going off
with this clown

52:43.452 --> 52:46.789
because I failed a non-test
I didn't know I took?

52:46.873 --> 52:48.958
Hello, Frank.
Nice to see you.

52:49.792 --> 52:52.503
Uh, what about the babies?

52:53.421 --> 52:55.089
I'm gonna reduce to two.

52:56.215 --> 52:58.885
Randy's gonna make bread
full-time.

52:58.968 --> 53:01.429
I love you and the six G's.

53:01.512 --> 53:04.182
I know there's some truth
to that, Frank,

53:04.265 --> 53:06.851
but medication or not,

53:06.934 --> 53:08.686
you're just not good for me.

53:10.521 --> 53:12.773
Look, the point is

53:12.857 --> 53:14.734
there's always gonna be
someone you love

53:14.817 --> 53:16.569
more than me and the kids.

53:17.737 --> 53:19.447
She means alcohol, Frank,

53:19.530 --> 53:20.740
because you're an alcoholic.

53:20.823 --> 53:21.824
Thank you.

53:21.908 --> 53:23.910
I got--
I got that.

53:23.993 --> 53:26.495
I need you to sign this.

53:26.579 --> 53:28.039
Says you'll never come forward

53:28.122 --> 53:31.083
to claim any paternity rights.

53:31.167 --> 53:33.127
Please.

53:33.211 --> 53:35.713
Usually, there's some...

53:35.796 --> 53:39.008
...exchange of funds
when rights are signed away.

53:41.302 --> 53:43.846
How's 5K for your trouble?

53:43.930 --> 53:46.390
I'd be a lot less trouble
for 10K.

53:46.474 --> 53:47.975
Good-bye, Frank.

53:48.059 --> 53:49.518
Ingrid, sugar,

53:49.602 --> 53:51.437
- su--sweetheart.
- No, no, no. Good-bye.

53:51.520 --> 53:55.191
W-w--honey, Ingy,
listen to me.

53:55.274 --> 53:58.444
That's two Ls
in "Gallagher"?

53:58.527 --> 54:00.905
Make it out to cash.

54:04.242 --> 54:05.826
<i>Now for breaking news,</i>

54:05.910 --> 54:08.704
<i>we go live to the scene
of a drive-by shooting--</i>

54:10.039 --> 54:12.583
Hey, campers.
What are we watching?

54:12.667 --> 54:14.710
We were watching <i>Showgirls,</i>
but it's over.

54:14.794 --> 54:16.545
Yep, show's over.
Time for bed, Kell.

54:16.629 --> 54:18.214
- Come on.
- I missed <i>Showgirls</i>?

54:18.297 --> 54:19.423
Gah.

54:21.342 --> 54:23.177
When she slips
on the marbles...

54:23.261 --> 54:25.429
Oh, my God, that's good.

54:25.513 --> 54:27.890
Ooh, candy corn.
Where did we get that?

54:27.974 --> 54:29.600
Dollar store.
Off-season aisle.

54:29.684 --> 54:32.645
Oh, I'ma eat the fuck
out of this.

54:32.728 --> 54:35.439
Hey, did Carl tell you
about the time

54:35.523 --> 54:38.734
that he shoved 16
of these fuckers up his nose?

54:38.818 --> 54:40.236
Come on, we don't need

54:40.319 --> 54:41.612
- to be talking about it.
- So gross.

54:41.696 --> 54:43.030
16?

54:43.114 --> 54:45.491
He bio-engineered
that shit right up there.

54:47.285 --> 54:49.245
- What's up, bro?
- With a fucking spoon

54:49.328 --> 54:50.955
trying to get it out.

54:54.834 --> 54:57.044
A hundred days he was sober,
Fiona.

54:59.130 --> 55:00.464
Who?

55:02.508 --> 55:03.676
Jason.

55:05.594 --> 55:07.221
My sponsee.

55:07.305 --> 55:08.973
Who?

55:09.056 --> 55:11.726
Jason from the shop.

55:11.809 --> 55:13.477
I'm his sponsor.

55:14.061 --> 55:16.731
You just got my sponsee
fucking drunk.

55:16.814 --> 55:18.899
He didn't say
he was your--

55:18.983 --> 55:20.484
A hundred days,

55:20.568 --> 55:22.361
he was sober!

55:33.205 --> 55:36.417
And that's sad.
I'm sorry for him.

55:37.752 --> 55:41.172
But it's not my fault.
I didn't know.

55:41.255 --> 55:43.549
No, nothing's your fault
anymore, huh?

55:44.425 --> 55:46.093
You weren't there.
You don't know.

55:46.177 --> 55:49.138
I know someone
waved vodka in his face.

55:49.221 --> 55:52.016
I know when he left you,
he called his dealer

55:52.099 --> 55:53.851
and he shot up heroin.

55:56.645 --> 55:58.689
Oh.

56:00.858 --> 56:03.110
I'm sorry.

56:03.194 --> 56:05.446
Look, I didn't know.

56:10.493 --> 56:13.954
No, you didn't care enough
to know.

56:23.964 --> 56:25.800
Listen to me.

56:29.553 --> 56:32.139
I want you out
of this fucking house.

57:04.296 --> 57:05.631
What'd I miss?

57:05.714 --> 57:06.966
Uh...

57:08.843 --> 57:10.719
Ooh, candy corn.
