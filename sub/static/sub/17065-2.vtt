00:03.035 --> 00:04.835
Mom. Mom. Wake up.

00:04.860 --> 00:06.309
I think I'm having a heart attack.

00:06.405 --> 00:07.725
You're not having a heart attack.

00:07.773 --> 00:10.173
My chest is pounding,
and I'm slick from sweat...

00:10.275 --> 00:11.941
classic coronary event symptoms.

00:12.044 --> 00:14.044
I made a bad trade
in my stock market club.

00:14.069 --> 00:16.111
This is why bankers die at 40.

00:16.213 --> 00:18.682
So you have 28 years
until your first heart attack.

00:18.784 --> 00:19.849
Go rest up for it.

00:24.089 --> 00:25.755
Mama.

00:25.857 --> 00:27.857
Sweetie, what's the matter?

00:27.960 --> 00:29.225
I had my dream again.

00:29.328 --> 00:32.262
I was on the <i> Titanic,</i>
just like in the movie,

00:32.363 --> 00:34.464
but I was in bed with the old couple.

00:34.566 --> 00:35.465
Oh.

00:35.534 --> 00:37.100
Get in here.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.235
Mom, I'm going for a run.

00:40.272 --> 00:41.171
Taylor...

00:41.273 --> 00:42.872
it's 5:30 in the morning!

00:42.975 --> 00:44.074
It's 6:25.

00:44.176 --> 00:46.643
You mixed up the big hand
and the little hand again.

00:46.745 --> 00:47.865
'Cause it's dark in my room!

00:47.946 --> 00:49.412
Because it's 5:30!

00:50.616 --> 00:52.382
Just buy me a digital clock already!

00:55.654 --> 00:57.721
<i>How did he sleep through all this?</i>

00:57.823 --> 00:59.289
<i>I'm gonna kill him!</i>

00:59.391 --> 01:02.092
<i>But then I'd have to take care
of these animals by myself.</i>

01:02.160 --> 01:04.194
<i>Damn it! Greg lives!</i>

01:11.336 --> 01:13.603
You don't need to Purell your belly.

01:13.705 --> 01:15.171
<i>Oh, my little germaphobe.</i>

01:15.273 --> 01:17.774
<i>At this point,
she's more Purell than girl.</i>

01:17.909 --> 01:19.442
Yo, Scooby, your stock market club

01:19.544 --> 01:21.211
is getting a little too serious.

01:21.313 --> 01:22.846
No more waking me up
in the middle of the night

01:22.948 --> 01:24.981
with fake symptoms
of a fake heart attack.

01:25.006 --> 01:26.044
Can't help it, Mom.

01:26.069 --> 01:28.410
It's this type of intensity
that's gonna make me rich...

01:28.435 --> 01:30.754
so I can afford things
like matching plates.

01:30.856 --> 01:32.222
First apartment. Red Lobster.

01:32.357 --> 01:34.624
Mom, I need you to sign this
permission slip for basketball,

01:34.693 --> 01:36.493
and here's my revised soccer schedule.

01:36.595 --> 01:38.595
You know, if you spent
as much time on schoolwork

01:38.664 --> 01:40.830
as you did on sports,
you'd be valedictorian.

01:40.899 --> 01:43.533
I can guarantee you that's not true.

01:43.602 --> 01:45.935
I feel great... a full nine hours.

01:46.004 --> 01:47.070
Who wants Kashi?

01:49.274 --> 01:51.141
Peter Felton sent you an e-mail?

01:54.246 --> 01:55.246
Huh.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.580
My old job has opened up again.

01:57.683 --> 01:58.882
Before he hires someone else,

01:58.984 --> 02:00.384
he wants to know if I'm interested.

02:00.485 --> 02:01.685
Yes!

02:01.787 --> 02:03.553
I mean, you are, aren't you? No?

02:03.655 --> 02:04.788
Only if you want to. Do you?

02:04.813 --> 02:06.044
Why don't you take the floor on this?

02:06.069 --> 02:10.026
Greg, you realize if I worked,
we would have to hire someone

02:10.127 --> 02:12.395
to clean the house and watch the kids,

02:12.531 --> 02:14.798
so there'd only be, like,
this much extra money.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.332
No, we wouldn't have to hire
someone to clean the house.

02:16.435 --> 02:17.555
You could do it on Saturdays.

02:17.602 --> 02:19.202
I retract that... obviously.

02:21.139 --> 02:22.139
I'll think about it.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.074
He wants to know by the end of the day.

02:24.176 --> 02:25.976
Can you drive Taylor to soccer
this afternoon?

02:26.078 --> 02:28.078
Oh, I'd love to, but I have to
go to campus to give a lecture.

02:29.347 --> 02:31.514
Taylor! Oliver! In the car!

02:31.616 --> 02:33.049
Anna-Kat?

02:33.151 --> 02:36.352
Anna-Kat, it will sting
if you put it there.

02:37.723 --> 02:39.789
Mama, Oliver hit me in the nuts.

02:39.858 --> 02:41.458
Sweetie, girls don't have nuts.

02:41.593 --> 02:42.625
I'm pretty sure they do.

02:42.728 --> 02:44.961
I didn't hit her.
I gave her her water bottle.

02:45.063 --> 02:47.397
Yeah, and you slammed it hard
right in my nuts.

02:47.499 --> 02:49.966
Okay, I'm too tired for this.
Everybody out.

02:50.068 --> 02:52.001
Mom, you're supposed to wait until
we're at the front of the line.

02:52.104 --> 02:53.870
Not today. Out!

02:55.574 --> 02:57.540
You can't let them out here!

02:57.642 --> 02:59.242
They're on the sidewalk!

02:59.311 --> 03:01.244
<i>I bet running over Crossing Guard Sandy</i>

03:01.346 --> 03:04.714
<i>would make a real satisfying
"Tha-thunk!" sound.</i>

03:07.753 --> 03:09.619
Guys, I'm not even here.

03:09.755 --> 03:11.788
I got to get groceries,
buy Taylor a digital clock,

03:11.890 --> 03:13.450
track down a thousand brown sugar cubes

03:13.525 --> 03:14.925
for Anna-Kat's Great Wall of China.

03:15.026 --> 03:16.466
Honestly, what is she going to learn

03:16.528 --> 03:17.827
by watching me build that thing?

03:17.929 --> 03:19.095
Okay, sit down a second.

03:20.232 --> 03:22.132
What is going on?

03:22.234 --> 03:24.734
Staying at home with the kids...

03:24.836 --> 03:26.002
is exhausting.

03:26.104 --> 03:28.138
I know!

03:28.240 --> 03:29.240
Shut up.

03:29.274 --> 03:31.508
You're a mother, and you stay at home,

03:31.610 --> 03:33.710
but you have a housekeeper, a nanny...

03:33.812 --> 03:35.745
A house manager... whatever that is.

03:35.847 --> 03:37.347
She manages my house.

03:37.449 --> 03:39.082
I never run out of anything.

03:39.151 --> 03:41.785
I don't even know what running
out of toilet paper feels like.

03:41.887 --> 03:43.553
It feels like a coffee filter.

03:45.724 --> 03:48.224
Katie, look, you are
a real stay-at-home mom,

03:48.326 --> 03:50.126
not like some of these
other women in Westport...

03:50.228 --> 03:50.960
like her.

03:51.062 --> 03:52.662
I am not like them, okay?

03:52.764 --> 03:53.596
I'm way richer.

03:55.033 --> 03:56.432
And Celeste and I share custody...

03:56.535 --> 03:58.434
three days on, four days off.

03:58.459 --> 04:00.303
- Dirty little secret about divorce?
- Mm-hmm.

04:00.328 --> 04:01.815
Just when you want
to slip your kids a Benadryl

04:01.840 --> 04:04.007
and leave them at the animal shelter,

04:04.032 --> 04:05.932
you get to give them back to your ex.

04:06.111 --> 04:08.011
Ohh, I can't leave Greg.

04:08.146 --> 04:10.346
Can I? Nah.

04:10.448 --> 04:11.448
Nah.

04:11.483 --> 04:12.515
No.

04:12.617 --> 04:14.017
I just went over the school calendar.

04:14.052 --> 04:18.120
My kids have 11 days of school
in the entire month of November.

04:18.223 --> 04:19.454
That's a straight-up war on women.

04:19.558 --> 04:21.067
You know what else
is a straight-up war on women?

04:21.091 --> 04:22.569
- That whole half-day thing.
- Mm.

04:22.594 --> 04:24.604
Can Mama stay at home
and watch "Unreal" on Lifetime

04:24.629 --> 04:25.838
- or not?!
- Mm-hmm.

04:25.863 --> 04:27.163
You know what you need, Katie?

04:27.265 --> 04:28.731
You need a break from being a mom.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.099
- A break?
- Yes!

04:30.202 --> 04:31.242
Do all that stuff tomorrow

04:31.336 --> 04:33.436
and do something for yourself today.

04:33.461 --> 04:34.581
- You're right.
- I know.

04:34.606 --> 04:36.439
I do need a break.

04:36.541 --> 04:37.974
I'm gonna take a nap.

04:38.043 --> 04:39.475
Oh! You never take naps.

04:39.578 --> 04:42.045
I know! That's what's going to
make this one so delicious.

04:42.147 --> 04:43.012
Ooh!

04:43.114 --> 04:44.347
Oh! Call your housekeeper now

04:44.449 --> 04:46.449
so she puts lavender
underneath your pillow.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.354
I'm sensing you guys
are reaching maximum Doris.

04:51.456 --> 04:52.456
Yeah.

04:52.557 --> 04:54.724
But it's okay, because I'm taking a nap.

05:01.299 --> 05:03.233
<i>Ugh! That's Oliver's lunch!</i>

05:03.301 --> 05:05.034
<i>The curse of a stay-at-home mom.</i>

05:05.136 --> 05:06.970
<i>You know, if I had a job,
I'd be at work,</i>

05:07.072 --> 05:09.539
<i>and everyone would be like,
"Eh, she's at work."</i>

05:09.641 --> 05:12.342
<i>Man, I'd blame everything on work.</i>

05:18.316 --> 05:19.316
<i>All right.</i>

05:19.417 --> 05:20.583
<i>I'm in and out.</i>

05:20.685 --> 05:22.118
Mrs. Otto!

05:22.220 --> 05:24.187
- You can't park there!
- <i>You don't need to acknowledge her.</i>

05:24.256 --> 05:25.855
- <i>Just smile and keep going.</i>
- Mrs. Otto!

05:25.957 --> 05:27.457
<i>Like when you're watching
a movie with your parents</i>

05:27.559 --> 05:30.637
- <i>and people start doing it.</i>
- Mrs. Otto, I know you can hear me!

05:30.662 --> 05:32.662
<i>I bet Sandy's never done it.</i>

05:37.302 --> 05:40.069
Can you please make sure
this gets to Oliver Otto?

05:40.171 --> 05:41.304
Mrs. Otto!

05:42.807 --> 05:44.340
Nurse Chapel.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.776
I really need
the kids' vaccination dates.

05:46.878 --> 05:49.112
- I've e-mailed you three times!
- Mm-hmm. Right.

05:49.214 --> 05:51.481
The dates are right in my phone,
right here.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.716
This really should've been
taken care of weeks ago.

05:53.818 --> 05:54.851
I know,

05:54.953 --> 05:57.754
I've been ignoring many, many reminders.

05:57.889 --> 06:00.290
<i>If I had a job,
I'd have my assistant do this.</i>

06:00.392 --> 06:01.925
<i>I'd have my assistant do everything.</i>

06:02.027 --> 06:03.293
<i>And he'd be cute.</i>

06:03.428 --> 06:06.296
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

06:07.399 --> 06:08.665
Katie!

06:08.733 --> 06:10.700
<i>Ugh! Skinny mommies
in tight, white jeans.</i>

06:10.802 --> 06:12.068
<i>Good for you.</i>

06:12.170 --> 06:14.037
We need to get your picture
for the school newsletter.

06:14.139 --> 06:16.539
Not now, Suzanne.
This is not what I look like.

06:16.641 --> 06:18.508
It pretty much is.

06:20.011 --> 06:21.011
Chin up, Katie.

06:21.112 --> 06:22.545
I have a double chin, so...

06:22.647 --> 06:23.647
Try the other side.

06:23.715 --> 06:25.115
Okay, well, it's on that side, too.

06:30.021 --> 06:31.387
Mrs. Otto!

06:31.523 --> 06:33.756
You are not supposed to park
in the yellow!

06:33.858 --> 06:35.558
Do not make me write you up.

06:35.660 --> 06:36.759
<i>Write me up?</i>

06:36.861 --> 06:38.394
<i>Is it possible this woman is insane?</i>

06:38.463 --> 06:40.930
<i>How are you supposed to talk
to an insane person?</i>

06:41.032 --> 06:44.100
Okay, Sandy. You're the boss.

06:45.971 --> 06:48.438
<i>My nap is 5 feet away.</i>

06:53.478 --> 06:54.911
Hey.

06:55.013 --> 06:56.713
What are you doing here?
I thought you were at work.

06:56.815 --> 06:57.815
I think I'm getting sick.

06:57.849 --> 06:58.982
What are you talking about?

06:59.084 --> 07:00.817
You were perfectly fine two hours ago.

07:00.919 --> 07:02.719
Yeah, but when I got in the car,
I started feeling clammy.

07:02.821 --> 07:05.121
My throat is scratchy,
and my tongue is big.

07:05.223 --> 07:07.190
I'm, like, very aware of my tongue.

07:07.292 --> 07:09.092
I need sleep and my neti pot.

07:09.194 --> 07:11.527
<i>He's not even sick! He's man-sick.</i>

07:11.629 --> 07:12.929
<i>You know what I call
having a little cough</i>

07:13.031 --> 07:14.297
<i>and wanting to go back to bed?</i>

07:14.399 --> 07:15.465
<i>Every day of my life!</i>

07:15.567 --> 07:16.599
Move over.

07:16.668 --> 07:18.001
I'm taking a nap.

07:18.103 --> 07:20.036
Oh, no, I totally forgot...
I'm supposed to be

07:20.105 --> 07:21.971
the Reading Rascal today
in Anna-Kat's class!

07:22.073 --> 07:23.773
You signed up for that on purpose?

07:23.875 --> 07:24.875
What are you, an idiot?

07:24.976 --> 07:27.777
I can't go. I might get her class sick.

07:27.879 --> 07:29.045
You have to cover for me.

07:29.147 --> 07:30.279
No.

07:30.382 --> 07:31.581
No, Greg. Mnh-mnh.

07:31.683 --> 07:33.149
But Anna-Kat picked the book.

07:33.251 --> 07:34.751
She's so excited.

07:34.853 --> 07:36.319
It's about a cat.

07:36.421 --> 07:39.122
I think you'll find it's got
some really surprising turns.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.690
Fine!

07:40.792 --> 07:42.492
But you should not be allowed
to wear that T-shirt!

07:42.594 --> 07:43.926
If you were a real feminist,

07:44.029 --> 07:46.596
you would down some DayQuil
and rally like a mommy would.

07:46.698 --> 07:48.131
You know what?

07:48.266 --> 07:49.999
You're right.

07:50.068 --> 07:51.268
I'm gonna take off this shirt.

07:58.275 --> 08:01.351
"Hunky Mama Cat and her kittens
were on their way.

08:01.376 --> 08:04.675
Hunky Mama Cat said, 'Where's Patches?'"

08:04.700 --> 08:05.999
Daddy does voices.

08:06.117 --> 08:08.493
Daddy also gets
nine hours of sleep a night.

08:09.509 --> 08:12.417
"Hunky Mama Cat does every
last thing for her kittens.

08:12.488 --> 08:15.789
She feeds them, she plays with them,

08:15.892 --> 08:17.978
she licks them clean."

08:18.694 --> 08:19.927
Does she complain?

08:20.029 --> 08:21.029
No.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.130
Mnh-mnh.

08:22.198 --> 08:24.098
But she has every right to complain.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.535
Yeah, I know it was her choice,
but Hunky Mama Cat...

08:27.637 --> 08:29.103
still wonders...

08:29.205 --> 08:31.805
what the hell happened to her life.

08:31.908 --> 08:35.976
You know, before she decided
to spew kittens onto the planet,

08:36.078 --> 08:37.945
she had a great job.

08:38.047 --> 08:40.681
She was North American sales director

08:40.783 --> 08:43.250
of Rollaboo Stroller Company.

08:43.385 --> 08:44.485
Hunky Mama Cat?

08:44.587 --> 08:46.053
Mm-hmm. Yes. She was.

08:46.155 --> 08:49.957
She got to wear high heels.
She got to fly in airplanes.

08:50.059 --> 08:53.894
She even had the special
golden corporate credit card.

08:53.963 --> 08:58.032
And Peter, the president
of the entire corporation,

08:58.134 --> 09:00.200
e-mailed Hunky Mama Cat

09:00.303 --> 09:03.070
and offered her her old job back!

09:04.607 --> 09:06.073
It was the best moment.

09:06.175 --> 09:08.409
I mean, they want her so much

09:08.511 --> 09:11.011
that after 12 years,
they're still coming after her.

09:11.113 --> 09:13.847
And every morning,
there's a box of pastries,

09:13.950 --> 09:15.616
and I don't know who brings them,

09:15.751 --> 09:16.850
and I don't care!

09:18.287 --> 09:21.021
It's okay. My mom had a breakdown, too.

09:29.131 --> 09:31.198
<i>Screw it. I'm napping here.</i>

09:33.000 --> 09:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:54.457 --> 09:57.024
I patrol vehicles
for forgotten car-seat kids.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.893
It's rare to find a drugged-out mommy.

09:59.996 --> 10:00.996
I'm not drugged-out.

10:01.130 --> 10:02.663
I deserve to be, but I'm not.

10:02.765 --> 10:05.032
And button up down there!

10:05.134 --> 10:06.834
There are children within 100 yards.

10:12.174 --> 10:13.240
Oh, how'd it go?

10:13.309 --> 10:15.709
I hate that evil witch, Sandy.

10:15.811 --> 10:17.478
You mean beloved Crossing Guard Sandy?

10:17.580 --> 10:19.313
She carries stunned birds
to the animal shelter.

10:19.415 --> 10:21.081
She caught me with my pants unbuttoned,

10:21.183 --> 10:22.850
and now she thinks
I'm a molester or something.

10:22.952 --> 10:24.192
Why were your pants unbuttoned?

10:24.220 --> 10:25.586
Because I'm fat, Greg!

10:25.721 --> 10:26.887
I was sleeping in the car,

10:26.989 --> 10:29.523
and I unbuttoned myself,
like a normal fat person.

10:29.658 --> 10:31.058
Not like a pervert.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.927
Scoot over. I need to rest my eyes.

10:34.029 --> 10:35.189
You were sleeping in the car?

10:35.264 --> 10:36.630
You know what...
you don't understand my life.

10:36.732 --> 10:39.266
All I do all the time
is think about other people...

10:39.368 --> 10:42.035
you, the kids, especially Anna-Kat.

10:43.572 --> 10:45.005
At least you get a break.

10:45.074 --> 10:46.074
- A break?
- Mm-hmm.

10:46.142 --> 10:47.841
I go to work. You seem to forget that.

10:47.943 --> 10:49.710
I work all day, and then I come home

10:49.812 --> 10:51.545
and continue to work
by helping you with the kids.

10:51.647 --> 10:52.927
- I don't get a break.
- Oh, please.

10:52.982 --> 10:54.014
Work is a break.

10:54.116 --> 10:55.482
You go to work, you have a lunch break,

10:55.584 --> 10:57.351
an afternoon break, a break room.

10:57.453 --> 11:00.197
You have a whole room
dedicated to breaks.

11:00.222 --> 11:01.569
If work is a break,
why don't you go back to work?

11:01.594 --> 11:02.666
- Maybe I will.
- Good.

11:02.691 --> 11:04.568
- Don't think I won't.
- Fine. I just want you to be happy.

11:04.593 --> 11:06.871
Well, maybe I'll just
go back to work and be happy!

11:06.896 --> 11:08.896
You realize I'm agreeing with you and
your voice just keeps getting louder?

11:08.998 --> 11:12.065
It's 'cause I'm tired. And I need a nap.

11:12.168 --> 11:14.168
That's the landline.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.403
If someone is trying
to sell me solar power again,

11:16.505 --> 11:17.871
I'm gonna go ape turd on them!

11:19.375 --> 11:21.108
Take me off your list!

11:22.211 --> 11:23.277
Oh.

11:23.379 --> 11:24.411
Really?

11:25.848 --> 11:28.182
Okay. Somebody will be there.

11:28.284 --> 11:29.817
No, thank you.

11:29.919 --> 11:31.618
What is it?

11:31.721 --> 11:33.654
Oliver got caught insider-trading

11:33.756 --> 11:35.556
in his stock-market club.

11:35.658 --> 11:37.057
Is that even possible

11:37.159 --> 11:38.792
in a made-up club using pretend money?

11:38.861 --> 11:40.294
It's idiotic, but it's cheating.

11:40.429 --> 11:42.262
He's suspended for the rest of the day.

11:42.364 --> 11:43.297
You have to go pick him up.

11:43.399 --> 11:44.865
I took a double dose of DayQuil.

11:44.967 --> 11:45.799
So?!

11:45.901 --> 11:47.301
Well, I'm not good on uppers.

11:47.403 --> 11:48.602
It has the opposite effect on me.

11:48.704 --> 11:49.704
Up is down, down is up.

11:49.805 --> 11:51.271
I keep thinking I'm smelling mangos.

11:51.373 --> 11:52.272
Oh, Greg!

11:52.374 --> 11:54.208
Is there anything normal about you?

11:54.310 --> 11:57.144
I'm all jacked up, honey!
It's not safe for anybody!

11:58.280 --> 11:59.747
Insider trading, Oliver?

11:59.849 --> 12:01.048
I used to have one goal in life...

12:01.150 --> 12:02.950
to have a man-made stream in my yard.

12:03.052 --> 12:04.218
Now I have a new one...

12:04.320 --> 12:06.787
keep my only son
out of white-collar prison.

12:06.889 --> 12:08.388
White-collar prison isn't that bad.

12:08.524 --> 12:10.824
Grant Windsor's dad was in
for 16 months.

12:10.926 --> 12:13.460
All he did was play squash
and get super-ripped.

12:13.529 --> 12:14.628
Which is why I'm going to make sure

12:14.730 --> 12:16.497
they put you in regular prison.

12:16.599 --> 12:19.133
That is now my new goal
in life, young man!

12:19.902 --> 12:20.801
Mrs. Otto.

12:20.903 --> 12:22.035
Nurse Chapel.

12:22.138 --> 12:24.204
I thought it was strange
that all of your children

12:24.306 --> 12:25.839
got their shots on their birthdays,

12:25.941 --> 12:27.541
so I troubled myself to put in a call

12:27.643 --> 12:29.042
to your pediatrician.

12:29.145 --> 12:30.544
I think you know where this is headed.

12:30.646 --> 12:32.746
I do. Can we just get to it?

12:32.848 --> 12:34.648
You just can't make up vaccination dates

12:34.717 --> 12:36.650
and put them
on official school documents.

12:36.752 --> 12:39.787
I don't know, Mom. I think
that falls under mail fraud.

12:39.889 --> 12:42.289
Good instincts, Oliver. Aggravate me.

12:42.391 --> 12:44.091
Anna-Kat needs a booster today.

12:44.193 --> 12:45.553
You have to pull her out of class.

12:45.594 --> 12:46.393
Now?!

12:46.495 --> 12:48.362
She could be teeming with disease.

12:48.464 --> 12:49.563
Teeming with it!

12:49.665 --> 12:52.065
Okay. Nurse Chapel, you are here.

12:52.168 --> 12:53.600
I'm gonna need you here.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.774
You let me walk around
completely unprotected?!

13:00.876 --> 13:03.143
It's not a big deal.
It's an MMR booster.

13:03.245 --> 13:05.646
That's measles, mumps, and rubella.

13:06.448 --> 13:08.482
That's what I have. I have all of that!

13:08.617 --> 13:09.697
You don't have any of that.

13:09.752 --> 13:11.051
Hang on.

13:11.153 --> 13:12.519
I forgot something.

13:12.621 --> 13:15.189
<i>There's no way I'm coming back
here for just one kid.</i>

13:15.291 --> 13:17.624
I was right in the middle of practice.

13:17.726 --> 13:19.766
You were supposed to be
in the middle of math class.

13:19.795 --> 13:22.041
You said I could miss math today
to practice basketball

13:22.066 --> 13:23.630
because now I have soccer after school.

13:23.655 --> 13:24.745
When did I say that?!

13:24.769 --> 13:26.134
When you signed
the permission slip this morning.

13:26.135 --> 13:27.935
Ohh! I thought
it was for something else.

13:28.037 --> 13:29.277
I can't control what you think.

13:32.842 --> 13:34.675
Ugh!

13:36.912 --> 13:38.846
What?!

13:40.182 --> 13:42.683
Sandy!!

13:42.785 --> 13:43.951
I can't.

13:44.053 --> 13:46.286
I can't do it anymore. I just can't.

13:46.388 --> 13:49.196
I have a marketing degree from Duke!

13:55.581 --> 13:57.370
The school gave you a boot?

13:57.395 --> 14:00.596
No, I bought it on eBay
with some of my Christmas tips.

14:02.215 --> 14:04.382
Thanks for the empty card, by the way.

14:04.451 --> 14:06.618
Just let me go.

14:06.753 --> 14:08.453
I don't know who you think you are.

14:09.789 --> 14:12.357
I don't know who I am, either.

14:12.459 --> 14:14.259
What happened to me, Sandy?

14:14.361 --> 14:16.527
Look at you. You've got a job.

14:16.630 --> 14:18.863
You're in a position of authority.

14:18.965 --> 14:20.198
You have a purpose.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.566
Kind of.

14:21.668 --> 14:22.800
And I have seen you

14:22.902 --> 14:25.236
sitting on your folding chair
under the shade umbrella

14:25.338 --> 14:27.005
taking a nap.

14:27.107 --> 14:28.206
You got it all.

14:28.275 --> 14:30.441
A job, naps...

14:30.543 --> 14:32.243
everything.

14:32.345 --> 14:34.545
And I admire you.

14:34.648 --> 14:36.681
How sad is that?

14:36.783 --> 14:40.285
And all I have is a car
with three kids in it

14:40.387 --> 14:43.021
and a really bad smell
that I cannot seems to locate.

14:43.123 --> 14:44.756
I don't think it's me.

14:46.159 --> 14:47.458
It might be me.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.661
When did this become my life?

14:49.763 --> 14:52.835
You're right, Crossing Guard Sandy.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.567
I need to go back to work.

14:57.704 --> 14:59.404
Next time I'll have you towed.

15:01.708 --> 15:04.142
<i>I open up to her,
and this is what I get!</i>

15:04.244 --> 15:06.644
<i>You know what? I'm taking these cones.</i>

15:08.915 --> 15:09.981
Here.

15:11.384 --> 15:12.517
Why did you only take four?

15:12.619 --> 15:14.252
Because the last thing that I need

15:14.354 --> 15:16.454
is 12 traffic cones
garbaging up our garage

15:16.556 --> 15:17.822
for the rest of forever.

15:21.428 --> 15:23.161
Seriously, Mom, this is ridiculous.

15:23.263 --> 15:25.530
I'm missing basketball
and soccer practice.

15:25.632 --> 15:28.266
Stop breathing your germs!
I'm completely defenseless!

15:30.403 --> 15:31.936
Mom, regarding these allegations,

15:32.005 --> 15:34.005
I just overheard a conversation
at Grant Windsor's,

15:34.040 --> 15:35.406
and I made a few smart trades.

15:35.508 --> 15:36.985
I don't want to hear it, Oliver!

15:37.010 --> 15:40.070
You don't know what happens in business.
You don't even have a job!

15:44.117 --> 15:45.850
Wh... Wh... Why did we pull over?

15:45.952 --> 15:47.585
What did you just say?

15:48.555 --> 15:49.687
I love you?

15:49.789 --> 15:51.556
Did you just say
that I don't have a job?

15:51.658 --> 15:52.824
For your information,

15:52.892 --> 15:55.827
being a stay-at-home mom is my job!

15:55.929 --> 15:58.696
But apparently, today,
I'm pretty crappy at it!

15:58.798 --> 16:00.398
But not anymore!

16:00.500 --> 16:01.966
Get out of the car!

16:08.575 --> 16:09.674
This is humiliating.

16:09.776 --> 16:10.942
Good.

16:11.044 --> 16:13.344
If you keep doing
whatever it takes to get rich

16:13.446 --> 16:15.179
by cutting corners and breaking laws,

16:15.282 --> 16:17.015
this is where you're going to wind up...

16:17.117 --> 16:18.950
cleaning up trash
by the side of the road,

16:19.052 --> 16:20.251
like a common criminal.

16:20.353 --> 16:21.953
Why do I have to do this?

16:22.055 --> 16:23.655
Because you're missing one booster shot.

16:23.723 --> 16:24.723
You're not gonna die,

16:24.791 --> 16:26.557
and a little dirt never killed anybody.

16:26.660 --> 16:28.459
Mama would never let that happen to you.

16:28.561 --> 16:30.028
Don't touch that needle!

16:30.130 --> 16:31.229
This isn't fair!

16:31.331 --> 16:33.931
Come on. I want to pick up trash, too.

16:34.034 --> 16:36.566
No! You stay in there and keep studying.

16:36.591 --> 16:37.926
And you're only playing one sport,

16:37.951 --> 16:39.249
so you can concentrate
on your schoolwork.

16:39.274 --> 16:40.340
That stinks!

16:40.365 --> 16:43.362
Well, it's what I think,
and you can't control it.

16:43.387 --> 16:44.452
<i>No after-school babysitter</i>

16:44.477 --> 16:46.144
<i>could parent my kids the way I do.</i>

16:46.246 --> 16:47.645
<i>I'm not just looking after them.</i>

16:47.747 --> 16:50.782
<i>I am trying to shape them
into halfway-decent people.</i>

16:50.884 --> 16:53.051
There's an old sock next to the shrub.

16:53.153 --> 16:54.153
I'm not touching that.

16:54.254 --> 16:56.087
In prison, you'd be touching worse.

16:58.258 --> 17:00.858
<i>Besides, if some babysitter
made my kids do this,</i>

17:00.960 --> 17:02.727
<i>I'd probably have them arrested.</i>

17:02.829 --> 17:06.497
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson
both died on July 4, 1826...

17:06.598 --> 17:09.000
the 50th anniversary
of American independence.

17:09.102 --> 17:10.102
They wrote...

17:10.203 --> 17:11.868
How could you support me taking a job

17:11.971 --> 17:14.172
when raising our kids is so important?

17:14.273 --> 17:16.795
Katie, I'm Skyping with my students.
Can this wait?

17:17.013 --> 17:19.262
Oh, they're five grad students,
and four of them are ladies.

17:19.287 --> 17:21.122
- They need to hear this.
- Can you hold that thought...

17:21.146 --> 17:25.349
Ladies, being a stay-at-home mom
suuucks.

17:25.452 --> 17:27.018
It does.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.653
But I'm like one of those Navy SEALs

17:28.755 --> 17:30.922
they sent to kill Osama bin Laden.

17:31.024 --> 17:33.524
They dodged the bullets
and didn't get a lot of sleep,

17:33.626 --> 17:35.893
but they were convinced
that they were doing

17:35.995 --> 17:37.662
the most important job in the world.

17:37.731 --> 17:39.797
And being at home with my kids

17:39.899 --> 17:42.633
is the most important thing
I could be doing right now.

17:42.736 --> 17:44.001
But don't fool yourselves.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.970
Being a working mom sucks, too...

17:46.072 --> 17:48.272
just in a different way.

17:48.375 --> 17:50.675
Guys, you've got it made.

17:50.777 --> 17:52.902
My husband is working in bed right now,

17:52.927 --> 17:54.191
and he's not wearing any pants.

17:54.216 --> 17:56.771
- Class dismissed.
- Oh, come on! They've met me!

17:56.880 --> 17:58.015
They know what you're dealing with.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.617
These aren't my grad students.

17:59.719 --> 18:01.919
This is History 101.

18:02.021 --> 18:04.155
<i>300 freshmen.</i>

18:08.661 --> 18:09.827
<i>Go, Cardinals.</i>

18:12.132 --> 18:13.865
Why didn't you shut me up?

18:13.933 --> 18:15.600
You compared yourself with SEAL Team 6.

18:15.702 --> 18:17.302
I was curious to see where it was going.

18:17.370 --> 18:20.131
Besides, I didn't think you were gonna
bring up I'm not wearing pants.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.340
So, you're turning down the job?

18:22.442 --> 18:24.242
I'm turning down the job.

18:25.111 --> 18:26.477
Mama! You were right!

18:26.579 --> 18:28.279
It stings bad!

18:29.816 --> 18:31.749
No, no, no, no, no.

18:31.851 --> 18:33.251
You take your nap.

18:33.353 --> 18:34.786
I'll take care of this.

18:34.888 --> 18:36.187
Thank you.

18:59.746 --> 19:01.746
No.

19:03.416 --> 19:06.217
Would you rather have hair
for teeth or teeth for hair?

19:06.286 --> 19:08.619
Hair for teeth. No-brainer.
Smoothies for every meal.

19:11.624 --> 19:12.844
Hey, what are you doing down here?

19:12.869 --> 19:14.235
I thought you needed a nap.

19:14.260 --> 19:15.526
I do.

19:15.628 --> 19:17.695
But I don't want to miss the fun parts.

19:18.565 --> 19:21.632
And, Oliver, I don't want you
to miss the fun parts, either.

19:21.734 --> 19:24.702
I think it's time
we let the stock market club go.

19:24.804 --> 19:26.170
You need to be a kid.

19:26.272 --> 19:28.039
I promise you can be a capitalist pig

19:28.107 --> 19:29.474
when you grow up.

19:29.576 --> 19:30.576
Thanks, Mom.

19:30.610 --> 19:31.610
Can we eat?

19:31.711 --> 19:33.578
Yeah.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.912
Whoo!

19:36.583 --> 19:38.316
<i>Okay, let's review.</i>

19:38.451 --> 19:40.852
<i>Being a stay-at-home mom does suck.</i>

19:40.954 --> 19:42.854
<i>And it's really important.</i>

19:42.956 --> 19:46.858
<i>But also, it can be
the best thing in the world.</i>

19:46.960 --> 19:48.125
<i>So yeah.</i>

19:48.194 --> 19:50.394
<i>This is what I would rather.</i>

20:03.446 --> 20:05.713
Whoever it is, leave now.

20:05.814 --> 20:07.047
I just need to brush my teeth.

20:07.149 --> 20:08.149
Anna-Kat!

20:08.250 --> 20:09.549
Mom, Crossing Guard Sandy
just dropped off

20:09.651 --> 20:10.817
a written warning for you.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.352
Let me file that right here.

20:13.789 --> 20:15.022
Not looking. Not looking.

20:15.124 --> 20:17.357
Guys! We are not a naked family!

20:17.459 --> 20:19.292
Nice picture of you
in the school newsletter.

20:19.395 --> 20:21.695
Ugh. Another one for the tub.

20:21.797 --> 20:23.096
Now, everybody, get...

20:23.198 --> 20:24.765
- Sorry.
- Greg?!

20:24.867 --> 20:26.877
I'm trying to balance out four DayQuil,
two NyQuil, and a Pepto-Bismol.

20:26.902 --> 20:27.978
I'm really chasing the dragon here.

20:28.003 --> 20:28.702
Get out!

20:28.804 --> 20:29.636
Get out!

20:29.738 --> 20:32.406
Get out! Get out! Get out!

20:33.305 --> 20:39.524
