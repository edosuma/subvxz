00:37.571 --> 00:38.771
[tires screech]

00:39.873 --> 00:42.441
[announcer speaking
Spanish over PA]

00:42.476 --> 00:44.676
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>San Juan, Puerto Rico.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:47.679
Okay, team, now I will read you
the mystery message

00:47.714 --> 00:49.247
that brought us here
to San Juan.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.916
"Dear Mike Tyson Mystery Team,

00:50.951 --> 00:54.019
every year the swallows return
from their annual migration

00:54.054 --> 00:58.423
to build their nests here
at the mission of
San Juan Capistrano.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.791
But they don't
come back anymore.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.259
Where are the swallows?

01:01.294 --> 01:03.929
May God bless you and keep you,
Sister Agnes."

01:03.964 --> 01:07.099
-San Juan Capistrano?
-That's right, dude.

01:07.134 --> 01:10.502
So, what are we doing
in San Juan, Puerto Rico?

01:10.537 --> 01:13.538
Oh, damn. Oh, double dog, damn.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.208
-Let me call Deezy.
-[cell phone beeps]

01:16.243 --> 01:18.610
-[Deezy]<i> Hello?</i>
-Deezy, what's up, fool?

01:18.645 --> 01:20.178
You got us
in the wrong San Juan.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.147
Pigeon says
we're in Puerto Rico.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.483
Okay, hold up, Mike.
Lemme see what I did here.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.586
It looks like
I booked you on a flight
to the wrong San Juan.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.020
The one you're in
is in Puerto Rico.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.489
[Mike]<i> Yeah,</i>
<i>that's what Pigeon said.</i>

01:30.524 --> 01:31.823
Okay, good, good.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.625
Okay, at least now
we're on the same page.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.926
You know what I bet happened?

01:34.961 --> 01:36.761
I bet I started to type
"San Juan,"

01:36.796 --> 01:38.330
and then it just
filled it in for me.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.831
You know, that smart type.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.366
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.835
Yeah, sure enough you have to
put in "Capistrano."

01:43.870 --> 01:45.070
Okay, that's my bad, Mike.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.771
I'm sorry for
the inconvenience.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.373
[Mike]<i> Oh, no inconvenience</i>
<i>at all, Deezy.</i>

01:48.408 --> 01:50.809
<i>I would've done the same thing</i>
<i>with that smart type.</i>

01:50.844 --> 01:52.310
[Marquess]<i> Michael,</i>
<i>what is going on?</i>

01:52.345 --> 01:54.012
[Mike]<i> Well they call it</i>
<i>"smart type"</i>

01:54.047 --> 01:56.381
<i>but it can lead you</i>
<i>to make a dumb mistake.</i>

01:56.416 --> 01:58.817
<i>That's interesting. That'd be</i>
<i>good for a stand-up comedian</i>
<i>to talk about.</i>

01:58.852 --> 02:01.086
Mmm-hmm. Now it looks like
there are no direct flights

02:01.121 --> 02:03.722
from San Juan Puerto Rico
to San Juan Capistrano.

02:03.757 --> 02:06.525
-[Mike]<i> I think Deezy says</i>
<i>we gotta live here forever.</i>
-[Yung Hee and Marquess]<i> What?</i>

02:06.560 --> 02:08.326
Oh, no, no, no, Mike.

02:08.361 --> 02:10.395
I just don't want you
to have to have
a layover somewhere.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.330
[Mike] Deezy is saying
he thinks he has to
lay off some of you.

02:12.365 --> 02:13.665
No, Mike.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.066
Here's what I...
Here's what I'm gonna do.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.169
I'm gonna book you
on a private charter flight

02:17.204 --> 02:19.304
with direct service
to San Juan Capistrano.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.940
Now, costs a little bit extra,
but you're worth it.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.942
And this is on me
because this was my bad.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.944
[Mike]<i> Don't beat</i>
<i>yourself up, Deezy.</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:28.046
Mmm, my credit card
was declined.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.549
But don't worry,
I got your credit card
right here.

02:32.519 --> 02:37.022
Oh! Ah, I mean,
this is the life.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.323
[chuckles]

02:38.358 --> 02:40.792
Now, just between you and me
and the bumblebees,

02:40.827 --> 02:43.195
I thought when I got involved
with your father,

02:43.230 --> 02:45.830
there would be a lot more
of this, you know?

02:45.865 --> 02:49.167
Like champagne and caviar,
not that dirty van.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.236
And even that house.
I mean, come on,

02:51.271 --> 02:55.073
it's a three bedroom,
one-and-half bath
in a subdivision in Vegas.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.943
Hello?
Where is the [bleep] money?

02:57.978 --> 03:00.278
Well, most of it's
in a trust fund for me.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.680
I get it when I turn 21.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.682
What? How much?

03:03.717 --> 03:05.717
Mmm, it's like, $500 million.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.452
Are you effing kidding me?

03:07.487 --> 03:11.590
-No, I think it's like,
$530 million.
-[Marquess groans]

03:11.625 --> 03:14.125
[inhales sharply]
Oh, I just had an orgasm.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.162
Okay, I have to know.
What is the first thing
you're gonna buy?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.264
Diamonds? New tits?
Diamond tits?

03:19.299 --> 03:21.733
Uh, no, I'm not gonna
buy anything.
I'm just gonna save it.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.069
Oh, my God. Really?

03:24.104 --> 03:25.837
So we're just gonna
stay in that house,

03:25.872 --> 03:27.405
driving around
in that shitty van?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.941
I mean, kill me. You know?
Just kill me now.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.077
-[rumbling]
-[all screaming]

03:32.746 --> 03:34.546
[all exclaiming]

03:34.581 --> 03:36.014
What the [bleep] is happening?

03:38.652 --> 03:41.019
-Is everything okay?
-I'm afraid not.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.154
-[alarm blaring]
-The plane is
completely unresponsive.

03:43.189 --> 03:44.756
The instruments
have gone crazy.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.458
It's the Bermuda Triangle.

03:46.493 --> 03:49.160
We're being sucked into
the Bermuda Triangle.

03:49.195 --> 03:52.330
They say it's a legend.
It's no legend.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.431
I'm sorry.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.033
Where are the other parachutes?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.835
There are no other parachutes.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.838
Of course, if the US
had voted to make
Puerto Rico a state,

03:59.873 --> 04:01.906
we would have to abide by
FAA regulations.

04:01.941 --> 04:04.309
But you said,
"No, be a territory."

04:04.344 --> 04:07.012
So, you know,
this one's on you guys.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.581
As we say in Puerto Rico,

04:09.616 --> 04:12.050
<i>"Hasta la vista,</i> baby!"

04:12.085 --> 04:13.085
[screams]

04:15.522 --> 04:17.155
[alarm blaring]

04:19.326 --> 04:20.926
[all screaming]

04:25.265 --> 04:26.331
[gasps]

04:36.309 --> 04:37.309
[Marquess] Yung?

04:41.715 --> 04:44.149
Hey, guys!
Are we in heaven, Marquess?

04:44.184 --> 04:46.918
Okay, ugh, no.
This is definitely not heaven.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.387
Heaven is crowded as
a mother [bleep].

04:49.422 --> 04:51.089
And it's dark.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.891
Everyone thinks it's gonna be
white clouds and pearly gates,

04:52.926 --> 04:56.561
but let me tell you,
it is a dump and a shitshow.

04:56.596 --> 04:57.729
[woman] Welcome.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.166
Please, follow me.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.235
The Commodore
would like to see you.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.771
[Marquess]
Wait, where's Pigeon?

05:06.806 --> 05:09.908
[woman] Oh,
he's going through processing.

05:09.943 --> 05:13.878
[Marquess] Oh, that's cute,
for the Bermuda Triangle.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.214
It's the KRC Triangle.

05:16.249 --> 05:19.684
KFC? Mmm, that sounds good.
I'm hungry.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.319
No, K-R-C.

05:21.354 --> 05:25.457
It stands for "Knowledge,
Responsibility and Control."

05:25.492 --> 05:26.925
And buttermilk biscuits.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.326
The five-dollar meal.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.628
Original recipe
or extra crispy.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.996
Finger lickin' good!

05:32.031 --> 05:33.765
Open that door,
I wanna meet the Colonel.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.734
Um, the Commodore.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.373
Ah, welcome, welcome.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.141
Please, have a seat.

05:43.176 --> 05:48.380
I'm L. Ron Hubbard,
founder of Scientology.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.647
I thought you died.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.851
No, young fellow,
I just came here.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.587
I'm sure
you have many questions.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.655
Allow me to answer them all.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.458
Let's start at the beginning.

06:00.493 --> 06:02.727
Why does man exist?

06:02.762 --> 06:05.597
The answer,
why should he not exist?

06:05.632 --> 06:07.899
Or to be more precise,

06:07.934 --> 06:10.268
is the point of man to exist?

06:10.303 --> 06:12.704
Or to be more,
you know, precise,

06:12.739 --> 06:14.606
what are
the 11 herbs and spices?

06:14.641 --> 06:18.410
To answer that,
we must first talk about Xenu.

06:18.445 --> 06:21.379
Also referred to as Xemu.

06:21.414 --> 06:25.850
He was the alien dictator
of the galactic confederacy.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.821
Xenu or Xemu,
some people say Xemu--

06:29.856 --> 06:33.258
Some people say KFC,
some people say
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

06:33.293 --> 06:36.561
I don't really have an opinion,
but KFC is faster.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.430
Ah, but we mustn't lose sight

06:38.465 --> 06:42.700
of the fact that Scientology
is the study of knowingness.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.236
It increases one's knowingness.

06:45.271 --> 06:47.705
I want to have knowingness
of the secret recipe.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.507
I promise I won't tell anyone.

06:49.542 --> 06:50.909
Clams.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.044
I knew it!
That's all that taste is,
clams!

06:53.079 --> 06:55.880
And as they continue
their evolution

06:55.915 --> 06:57.882
and mastery of their own minds,

06:57.917 --> 07:01.553
why, they can move
in all directions
through vibrations,

07:01.588 --> 07:05.657
and thus ready themselves
for interplanetary travel.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.992
I liked it when
Norm MacDonald played you.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.395
M'kay. Okay,
so we're gonna go.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.032
Well, you can't go.
You see, no one goes.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.935
No one leaves
the Bermuda Triangle,

07:16.970 --> 07:19.370
or the Church of Scientology.

07:19.405 --> 07:23.741
That's why we made this
our flagship location.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.343
[laughing]

07:26.779 --> 07:27.979
[door opens]

07:28.715 --> 07:30.081
He's clear.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.749
Pigeon, are you okay?
What did they do to you?

07:31.784 --> 07:34.719
Oh, well, they hooked me up
to this little fake machine,

07:34.754 --> 07:37.455
and then they asked me
a bunch of personal questions.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.090
And I spilled my guts,

07:39.125 --> 07:41.860
so now if I ever leave,
they'll tell everybody
I'm secretly gay.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.261
So I can never leave.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.530
But on the other hand,
I do feel better.

07:45.565 --> 07:46.898
I feel clear.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.633
Just like they kept saying
I would.

07:48.668 --> 07:51.470
Now, let's get
the rest of them processed.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.810
Oh, Marjorie, before we process
our new friends,

07:58.845 --> 08:00.979
why don't we go feed the birds?

08:01.014 --> 08:03.448
They give me such joy.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.386
[Yung Hee] Are those swallows?

08:08.421 --> 08:11.723
Some time ago, they got
sucked into the Triangle.

08:11.758 --> 08:15.126
Perhaps global warming
caused the trade winds

08:15.161 --> 08:16.628
to alter their course.

08:16.663 --> 08:20.298
[laughs] But perhaps,
something deep inside them

08:20.333 --> 08:24.202
wanted to know more about
who they really were.

08:24.237 --> 08:28.773
They've all been processed
and are clear.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.576
These are the swallows
of San Juan Capistrano.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.845
-That's the mystery we were
supposed to be solving.
-[gasps]

08:33.880 --> 08:36.681
The swallows were sucked into
the Bermuda Triangle

08:36.716 --> 08:38.016
just like us.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.984
Now we have to figure out
how to get out.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.185
[gasps] Wait.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.121
What is the opposite of suck?

08:43.156 --> 08:44.989
-Blow.
-Yes!

08:45.024 --> 08:48.092
Now, I don't have it all
figured out yet,

08:48.127 --> 08:53.731
but, swallows, suck,

08:53.766 --> 08:56.601
blow, blow.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.969
Suck.

08:58.004 --> 09:01.039
Swallow, blow, suck.

09:01.074 --> 09:05.043
Swallow, blow.
Blow, suck, swallow.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.079
Swallow, blow.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.181
-Suck--
-Okay,

09:10.216 --> 09:12.717
maybe it's because
I'm so clear now,

09:12.752 --> 09:16.854
but you saying,
"blow," "suck," "swallow,"
is giving me an idea.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.723
I think what we need to do,

09:18.758 --> 09:21.859
is that one of us needs to
suck off L. Ron Hubbard,

09:21.894 --> 09:25.029
and [bleep] just [bleep]
give him a good suck job,
and then...

09:25.064 --> 09:29.200
And this part
won't make sense to you
because none of you are clear.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.936
But I can tell you
with absolute clarity

09:31.971 --> 09:33.905
as a high-level Scientologist,

09:33.940 --> 09:38.543
that we will end up
in San Juan Capistrano
with all these dumb birds.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.245
[laughing]

09:43.282 --> 09:45.250
[swallows chirping]

09:53.593 --> 09:56.094
[Sister Agnes]
Oh, sisters, look,

09:56.129 --> 09:58.663
the swallows have returned.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.673
I'm so sorry
for what you all endured.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.809
Being preached
a made-up religion,

10:11.844 --> 10:14.012
full of fanciful stories,

10:14.047 --> 10:18.850
designed to take advantage
of the gullible
and get their money...

10:18.885 --> 10:21.953
Oh, shameful.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.821
Care to give to the Church?

10:23.856 --> 10:25.490
After all,

10:25.525 --> 10:30.228
Jesus who walked on water
and turned water into wine,

10:30.263 --> 10:33.965
gave his life
to provide the way to heaven,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.535
a magical, fanciful place
in the sky,

10:37.570 --> 10:40.338
where we shall live
among the angels!

10:40.373 --> 10:42.574
[theme music playing]
