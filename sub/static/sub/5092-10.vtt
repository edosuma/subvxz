WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:09.377
(whinnying)

00:09.410 --> 00:12.380
You know, horses are smarter
than people.

00:12.413 --> 00:16.284
You never heard of a horse going
broke betting on people.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.252
(laughter)

00:18.286 --> 00:21.522
Will Rogers said that.

00:21.555 --> 00:25.526
We take great pride in the fact
that our best and brightest

00:25.559 --> 00:28.829
have always been drawn to duty
in the mounted unit.

00:28.862 --> 00:33.467
The men and women of
the NYPD Mounted Unit

00:33.501 --> 00:36.070
are our ambassadors to visitors
to this city.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.506
And they have played
a tremendous role

00:38.539 --> 00:41.642
in keeping the peace
on our streets

00:41.675 --> 00:45.179
since the unit was founded
back in 1871.

00:45.213 --> 00:48.616
And I am happy to say that,
that tradition

00:48.649 --> 00:50.784
is in great hands today.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.654
Congratulations, good luck,

00:53.687 --> 00:56.324
God bless you,

00:56.357 --> 00:59.360
and God bless
the United States of America.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.463
(applause)

01:04.698 --> 01:07.568
(phone ringing)

01:23.784 --> 01:25.586
Nice job, fellas.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.521
Hey, Ray. Parker's gonna
have a conniption.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.123
Well, too bad for him.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.459
We've already lost one man
on this job.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.494
I'm not going
to another funeral

01:33.527 --> 01:35.729
because Parker refuses
to abide by the safety rules.

01:35.763 --> 01:36.830
I hear you, brother.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.232
Let's do it.

01:38.266 --> 01:42.203
Sully, we're pulling
everybody off.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.273
Right now?
Yeah. That means now.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.441
(horn blasts)
MAN:
Yo, tell the guys up top.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.380
(horn blasting)

01:52.413 --> 01:54.348
(horn stops)

01:54.382 --> 01:55.749
Go get your signs.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.287
Keep your heads up.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.189
Hey! Hey! What the hell
you think you're doing?!

02:01.222 --> 02:02.423
What does it look like?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.657
I'm shutting your ass down.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.559
I've got 400 yards of
concrete on the way.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.794
Well, you should have thought
of that

02:06.827 --> 02:08.429
before you started getting
our guys killed.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.465
You son of a bitch.
Thank you.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.733
And just so there's
no confusion--

02:12.766 --> 02:14.802
we're shutting down
all your jobs.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.910
Scumbags!

02:24.678 --> 02:26.614
Come on, guys.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.482
Well done.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.950
Congratulations.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.419
I heard you had a great uncle

02:31.452 --> 02:32.420
in the mounted unit,
right, Commissioner?

02:32.453 --> 02:35.623
Teddy Reagan. You must
have heard the story.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.725
No, sir.
Well, legend has it,

02:37.758 --> 02:40.394
Uncle Teddy and his
horse, Dolly, holed up

02:40.428 --> 02:42.663
in a boxcar one night
to get out of the cold.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.598
And as was the case
in those days,

02:44.632 --> 02:47.935
some mounted cops had
a flask in their boot.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.670
Long story short--

02:49.703 --> 02:51.705
Teddy and Dolly wake up
rolling into Pittsburgh

02:51.739 --> 02:53.407
just in time for sunrise.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.808
Needless to say,

02:54.842 --> 02:57.378
that was the end of the
glorious Reagan affiliation

02:57.411 --> 02:59.747
with the mounted unit.
Uh, Commissioner,
can I...?

02:59.780 --> 03:02.383
Excuse me. I got to
get back to work.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.618
Well done.
Thank you, sir.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.655
Welcome back
to the 21st century.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.324
Our Social Media Unit
picked it up about an hour ago.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.395
Who was the cop,

03:14.428 --> 03:16.797
and when did it happen?
His name's Acosta.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.698
Assigned to the 5-4.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.433
Apparently it happened
yesterday afternoon.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.303
Let's get his C.O.
up to my office.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.978
Mmm, thank God for wine.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.112
You know, the
night we met,

03:32.145 --> 03:34.715
if it wasn't for that bottle
of red I drank at dinner,

03:34.748 --> 03:35.949
I never would have
asked you out.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.586
Yeah, but I did say no.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.489
You did, but the
ice was broken.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.691
And after that,
you became a goal.

03:43.724 --> 03:47.661
Like a site you had to organize?
Hey, ten years
and three kids later,

03:47.695 --> 03:49.997
I'd say my campaign
was a success.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.501
Happy Anniversary.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.568
Happy Anniversary.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.339
The waiter was nice.
He was good.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.708
He deserved the tip.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.942
I'm stuffed.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.711
That veal was amazing.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.848
(gunshots, woman screams)

04:17.991 --> 04:19.893
Ray?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.595
(screaming)
Ray?!

04:21.629 --> 04:23.997
Help me!

04:26.900 --> 04:28.969
All right, let me get this
straight-- guy runs up,

04:29.002 --> 04:31.439
pops off four shots,
a dozen witnesses,

04:31.472 --> 04:32.906
but nobody gives
a description?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.775
Perp wore a mask
and gloves.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.577
Oh, boy.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.912
Let me guess-- he didn't say
around for a celebratory drink.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.782
What else you got?
He parked a late-model sedan

04:41.815 --> 04:45.386
around the corner.
He got in it and drove off.
We get a plate?

04:45.419 --> 04:46.987
A partial. We're running it
through RTCC

04:47.020 --> 04:48.689
and checking LPRs citywide.

04:48.722 --> 04:52.360
What a way to end
a night on the town, huh?
Meet your vic.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.763
Ray Milo: Organizing
Director Local 9056.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.531
Concrete guys, great.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.533
Rough bunch. More like
a tribe than a union.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.835
Mob hit?
Hey, in that racket,

05:01.869 --> 05:03.737
it wouldn't be first time,
Lieutenant.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.341
Excuse me.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.843
(sobbing)

05:09.877 --> 05:11.779
He bought me this dress...

05:11.812 --> 05:13.614
for our anniversary.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.383
Now look at it.

05:15.416 --> 05:19.720
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Milo.
(clearing throat)

05:19.753 --> 05:22.823
Yes, this is my partner,
Detective Reagan.
Mrs. Milo,

05:22.856 --> 05:25.426
I'm sorry for your loss.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.660
Look, is there anything
you could tell us

05:26.694 --> 05:29.497
that could help us find out
who did this to your husband?

05:29.530 --> 05:32.766
Any problems your husband was
having on the job? Anything?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.869
Ray's job was to make
contractors' lives miserable.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.871
He was good at it.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.708
He received threats,
but he laughed them off.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.543
Called it business as usual.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.111
Anything recently?

05:44.144 --> 05:47.114
He never said much about it.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.049
He told me not to worry
about a thing.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.784
"Don't worry about it."

05:50.818 --> 05:53.053
It was his mantra.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.923
Maybe I should put
it on his gravestone.

06:00.628 --> 06:03.797
That's okay.
Go ahead.
I'll take her home.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.833
Excuse me.

06:05.866 --> 06:10.404
You riding homicides again?
No, that's not
why I'm here.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.840
Was it bring-your-sister-along-
to-work-day and nobody told me?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.876
The victim, Ray Milo, was
a confidential informant.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.779
Who was he working for?

06:18.812 --> 06:22.716
He was working for me.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.222
Well, this isn't looking like
a quiet little homicide.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.057
What exactly were you
working on with this guys?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.628
I was building a
racketeering case

07:07.661 --> 07:09.730
in the construction industry.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.832
Crooked contractors
and unions.

07:11.865 --> 07:12.933
So what was Milo's role?

07:12.966 --> 07:16.570
He was wearing a wire on
his boss-- Dennis Driscoll.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.905
Runs the local 9056.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.240
Dennis Driscoll--
I heard of the guy.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.042
He was like a union reformer
back in the day.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.110
Supposed to be a good guy.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.745
He's not a good guy anymore.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.115
How'd you get Milo to flip?
I didn't. He came to us.

07:28.148 --> 07:33.186
He was upset about what
he believed Driscoll was
doing to the union.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.555
Last week
I convinced him

07:34.588 --> 07:36.223
to wear a wire,

07:36.256 --> 07:38.492
and tonight he's shot dead
in the middle of the street.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.160
Okay, hold on.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.229
Don't start blaming yourself
for this, all right?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.697
There's a hundred
and one reasons

07:43.731 --> 07:45.098
why this guy could have
got dead tonight.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.600
Maybe it's just as coincidence.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.570
I'm not a big believer
in coincidence, Danny.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.247
(laughing): Man, he bitch-slaps
that old guy.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.949
Let me see that again.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.917
(laughing)

08:03.951 --> 08:06.787
Reminds me of the time I caught
a guy for petit larceny.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.722
He resisted-- I bounced his head
off a panel truck.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.791
(laughter)

08:10.824 --> 08:12.760
Regular comedy festival
over there.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.227
You think this
is funny, Sarge?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.563
I think it's lousy.
(laughter)

08:15.596 --> 08:17.064
That's why I tell you...

08:17.097 --> 08:18.198
Always assume
you're being filmed.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.033
Yep. When I came
on the job,

08:20.067 --> 08:22.069
the only people on the streets
with cameras

08:22.102 --> 08:23.303
were journalists and tourists.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.039
Now, forget
about it.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.076
(phone ringing)

08:32.880 --> 08:33.981
New phone?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.983
No, I still
got the old one.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.986
Come on.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.689
Let's go get
our picture taken.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.894
(elevator bell dings)

08:46.927 --> 08:48.562
As you were.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.165
How wide has
the video spread?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.134
YouTube, Drudge,
all of them.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.269
The TV networks are at least
calling for our side,

08:56.303 --> 08:57.905
but they are going to run it.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.306
Captain Browne--
the officer's C.O.--

08:59.339 --> 09:01.675
is waiting for you
in your office, as requested.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.845
Good to see you, Brownie.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.047
Thanks for coming down.
You're welcome, Commissioner.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.315
Please sit down.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.818
I read
Officer Acosta's file.

09:10.851 --> 09:14.221
Tell me about the man.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.989
Solid, committed, proactive.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.091
Good example to the young
officers on the job.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.259
What's his status
right now?

09:19.292 --> 09:20.994
He's on modified
assignment, sir.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.864
Has I.A. talked to him?
They have, sir.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.234
What is Officer Acosta's account
of the incident?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.302
It's in the 49, sir.

09:29.336 --> 09:33.841
I'd like to hear it from him.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.283
Sorry to keep you waiting.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.318
I'm Dennis Driscoll, the
business manager for the union.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.788
Detective Reagan. This is my
partner Detective Curatola.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.890
Guys, hang in there.
I'll be right with you.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.328
I was at my grandson's
basketball game

09:55.362 --> 09:56.864
when I got the call.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.298
Ray Milo--

09:58.331 --> 10:00.634
he was not only my
organizing director,

10:00.668 --> 10:02.803
he was my good friend.
We mourn him.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.839
His wife said there
were threats.
Ray was a hell of a union man.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.942
As well as his work, which
is organizing job sites,

10:08.976 --> 10:11.244
these companies have to pay
good wages and benefits.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.013
And let's face it, there aren't
a lot of these contractors

10:13.046 --> 10:14.281
who like to share.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.684
We heard he had a beef
with a contractor yesterday.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.318
Yeah. He was a point man
on Parker/Rollins.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.820
We shut them down.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.421
A guy died in a
wall collapse,

10:21.454 --> 10:23.757
and Parker refused to correct
the safety problems.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.092
This guys Parker--

10:25.125 --> 10:26.794
he ever get violent
with anyone?

10:26.827 --> 10:28.962
Nah. He's more of a
telephone tough guy.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.031
He's real big on hollering.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.134
But, this business, you always
have to look over your shoulder.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.103
Exactly how much is this
shutdown costing Parker?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.672
Half a dozen sites--
it's got to be three a day.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.140
Three what?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.175
300,000.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.644
Wow.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.686
Yeah, I want to get a wire up
on Sullivan.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.688
No, right away.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.657
Yeah, okay.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.695
Reagan, hey.

11:01.729 --> 11:02.863
How you doing?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.431
A lot better than Ray Milo.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.699
Yeah.
Or his wife.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.100
We need to make sure that leak

11:07.134 --> 11:08.301
did not come from this office.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.470
Hey, Milo could've told a
hundred people he was informing.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.973
His pals, some drunk
he met in a bar, who knows?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.341
We need to make sure.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.143
I want to dump the phones
of everyone

11:16.176 --> 11:17.711
in this office
that knew of Milo's status.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.380
I've been running the
Rackets Bureau for six years.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.482
I've seen informants
refuse to testify,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.384
turn out to be
pathological liars,

11:24.417 --> 11:27.120
commit felonies while supposedly
working for the good guys.

11:27.154 --> 11:30.423
But I never had one
outed by this office.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.392
Well, Ray Milo was not
some craven bad guy

11:32.425 --> 11:34.895
who was selling out his pals
to save his own ass.

11:34.928 --> 11:35.963
He was a good guy.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.298
And by the way, he came to us;
you remember that?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.466
Fine. Get me a list of everyone

11:39.499 --> 11:42.035
who had access to the fact
that he was working for us.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.804
Two investigators,
the paralegal,

11:43.837 --> 11:44.972
my secretary, me and you.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.907
I want to LUDs and tolls
on everyone.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.008
Okay.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.509
Including you.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.144
And I'd feel left out
if you didn't.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.421
You know you're entitled to have
representation here with you?

12:01.454 --> 12:02.823
Yes, sir,

12:02.856 --> 12:04.357
but I don't want
any representation for this.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.393
FRANK:
Okay, fine.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.361
Tell me what happened.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.165
I approached a male white
for openly smoking marijuana.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.368
I told the subject to put it out
and to produce identification,

12:15.402 --> 12:18.171
at which point the subject
grabbed for my weapon, sir.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.842
So I stepped back and swung,
hitting him with an open hand

12:21.875 --> 12:24.544
and driving him to the ground,
where I cuffed him.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.914
You're sure he was
going for your weapon?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.448
Well, yes.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.050
In-in the moment, I was.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.953
And you're sure you didn't
use excessive force?

12:32.986 --> 12:36.256
As I said, sir, I thought
he was going for my weapon.

12:36.289 --> 12:40.227
I can vouch for Officer
Acosta's professionalism, sir.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.362
Officer Acosta,
you have had

12:42.395 --> 12:45.532
six civilian complaints
filed against you

12:45.565 --> 12:47.067
in the last two years.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.501
Yes, sir.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.870
The 5-4 is a
busy house, sir.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.304
Five were dropped,
one for verbal abuse,

12:51.338 --> 12:52.539
which was a load of bull.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.507
You had to be there,
sir, but it...

12:54.541 --> 12:56.376
But I wasn't there.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.412
As I wasn't there
during the arrest on the video.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.948
So I have to deal

13:00.981 --> 13:02.816
with what I can see.

13:02.850 --> 13:06.253
Yes, sir.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.795
Hang in there.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.469
(car horn honks)

13:22.502 --> 13:24.504
(men chanting)

13:27.207 --> 13:29.142
(clamoring)

13:29.176 --> 13:30.143
All right.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.411
No scabs here, guys.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.846
No scabs here, all right?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.514
Look at the shoes.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.949
We're not scabs.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.517
Maybe they can
bring this rat

13:37.550 --> 13:38.852
over to my ex-husband's house.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.320
Is he that bad?

13:40.353 --> 13:43.123
Yeah, he actually is.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.428
Mr. Parker.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.430
Detective Reagan. This is my
partner, Detective Curatola.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.565
We'd like to speak to
you for a minute, sir.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.567
(chanting continues in distance)

13:54.601 --> 13:56.069
Yeah, what can
I do for you?

13:56.103 --> 13:57.404
Gentleman you had
a dispute with

13:57.437 --> 13:58.605
ended up dead a few hours later.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.940
We'd like to talk
to you about it.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.375
Yeah. Can we
step over here?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.277
Yeah, why don't you
step right over here.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.580
Yeah, we've heard
there's been

14:07.614 --> 14:10.650
some arguing going on, you know,
some, uh, verbal altercations.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.518
(chuckles):
I mean, come on.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.586
I-I scream bloody murder
all day long.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.223
You know, I mean, you would,
too, if you were in my shoes.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.557
These damn union bloodsuckers.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.592
We're in a union.
Well, I'm happy for you.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.660
So what do you want from me?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.630
You want an alibi, my
lawyer's phone number, what?

14:23.663 --> 14:24.764
First, I'd love for you
to drop the attitude.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.067
Secondly, I'd like to know
where you were last night

14:27.100 --> 14:28.335
when Milo was shot.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.503
I was at the Contractor's
Association Dinner

14:30.537 --> 14:31.604
at the Waldorf.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.940
Can anyone corroborate that
for you?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.675
Like, a thousand contractors.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.577
Who, by the way, if they
would've announced the news

14:37.610 --> 14:39.112
that Milo had been killed,

14:39.146 --> 14:40.580
I think there would've been
a standing ovation.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.150
You probably would've
led the applause.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.962
(knock on door)

14:54.995 --> 14:55.929
Hey.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.998
Figured you might be hungry,
so I brought you

14:58.031 --> 14:59.432
some of your favorite Italian
from Reda's.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.169
Great. I'm famished.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.337
I haven't left this
office for hours.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.605
Yeah? You come up with anything?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.140
Been checking
the phone records

15:07.174 --> 15:09.242
of all my people
who knew about Milo.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.677
What about you?

15:10.710 --> 15:11.611
Eh, not much, either.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.014
I got a partial print
on a shell casing,

15:14.047 --> 15:16.183
we got a... message
out on the shooter's car,

15:16.216 --> 15:18.218
and I had two lovely
conversations--

15:18.251 --> 15:19.619
one with Parker
and one with Driscoll,

15:19.652 --> 15:22.722
who both, of course,
say they didn't do it.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.091
They're two beauties,
aren't they?
Yeah.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.525
We suspect that Parker's been

15:25.558 --> 15:27.560
kicking back to Driscoll
for years.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.729
Well, if either one of them knew
Milo was cooperating with you,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.965
that's motive, but they both
have solid alibis, so...

15:31.999 --> 15:33.967
If they did do it,
they hired it out.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.135
(door opens)

15:35.168 --> 15:36.269
COREEN:
One second.
Miss, please.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.704
I'm so sorry, Erin.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.306
No, it's okay.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.141
Mrs. Milo, this is
Detective Reagan.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.510
Sure. We met the night
you killed my husband.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.711
Hey, come on,
that's enough of that.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.113
Mrs. Milo...
Oh, just shut up!

15:46.146 --> 15:47.614
I don't want to hear
it. It's all crap.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.681
(sniffles)

15:48.715 --> 15:50.583
I found this in Ray's things.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.119
It has your name on it.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.587
Seems like he was

15:54.621 --> 15:56.990
taping your little meetings.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.459
ERIN (over tape):
Ray, we need to get
Driscoll on tape.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.061
It's the only way.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.130
It's the right thing to do.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.131
You know that.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.765
You can do this.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.102
MILO:
I'm not worried about me,
but what about my family?

16:09.136 --> 16:11.438
What if something happens?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.505
ERIN:
Nothing is gonna happen.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.507
Your family is gonna be fine.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.676
It's my job to protect you.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.744
(tape clicks)

16:17.777 --> 16:20.080
So, because you suck
at your job,

16:20.113 --> 16:22.982
I'm a widow
and my kids have no father.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.403
Hey, what do you got?

16:43.436 --> 16:44.637
We pulled video from around
the abandoned getaway car.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.638
Check this out.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.340
When was it?

16:47.374 --> 16:48.241
About an hour
after the shooting.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.642
All right,
clothes fit the description.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.378
Can't make out
this guy's face though.

16:51.411 --> 16:54.147
No, TARU said they can't
enhance it any more though.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.548
All right, well, if
you knew the guy,

16:55.582 --> 16:56.716
you could probably
recognize him, right?

16:56.749 --> 16:57.717
Yeah.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.819
Great.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.721
Hey, I need to see you.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.064
Ma'am. Come on.
Hey.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.065
Don't you "ma'am" me.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.333
Next time,
it's gonna be a summons.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.434
Really?
Yeah.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.469
(phone ringing)
And then what are
you going to do,

17:16.503 --> 17:18.805
beat me like you beat
that poor old man?

17:19.772 --> 17:21.074
Yeah?

17:21.108 --> 17:22.709
Regular tough guys,
smacking a man

17:22.742 --> 17:24.177
twice your age.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.312
JAMIE:
Sure thing.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.247
Catch you later.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.648
Only guys with
two cell phones

17:28.681 --> 17:30.417
are either drug dealers
or bookies.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.252
Come on, what's going on?

17:32.285 --> 17:33.520
I can keep a secret.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.355
I can keep a secret,
too, Sarge.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.623
Trust me on this one?

17:36.656 --> 17:37.657
WOMAN:
Hey.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.592
We're watching you.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.661
She's watching you.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.296
She's watching you.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.164
(both chuckle)

17:45.765 --> 17:48.435
There's even
a music video version now,

17:48.468 --> 17:49.769
set to "Another One
Bites the Dust."

17:49.802 --> 17:50.803
You want to see it?

17:50.837 --> 17:52.539
No, I don't want to see it.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.408
Do we know who's behind it?

17:55.442 --> 17:56.409
It was first posted

17:56.443 --> 17:57.444
by Jerry Randall.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.478
Remember him?

18:01.481 --> 18:03.216
Somebody still
paying him to write?

18:03.250 --> 18:06.386
He's blogging out of his
basement in Forest Hills now,

18:06.419 --> 18:08.421
but he's still the
same ol' Jerry,

18:08.455 --> 18:10.823
telling it
like it isn't.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.526
Guy's probably costing them more
in lawyers' fees

18:13.560 --> 18:16.129
than he ever made them
in circulation.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.897
Still, I always

18:17.930 --> 18:19.432
kind of admired his brass.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.867
Not sure the feeling's mutual.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.403
And he's been asked
for the unedited version?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.205
And refused.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.140
That's just Jerry doing his job.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.575
And how would you like me
to do mine here?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.543
If I may make a suggestion?

18:30.577 --> 18:31.578
Please.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.482
You need to think
outside the box.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.292
Hey.
Hey.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.593
Hey, you know the, uh,

18:46.626 --> 18:47.594
construction racket.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.728
Tell me if you can

18:48.761 --> 18:50.730
make out who
this guy is.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.632
Oh. Uh-oh.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.733
Man, you don't
pay me enough.

18:53.766 --> 18:54.934
Really?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.603
I didn't make that
gun collar go away,

18:56.636 --> 18:57.770
you'd still be in
the joint right now.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.373
Yeah, but I'd be breathing,
plus three hots and a cot.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.674
Telling me you're afraid
of this little guy?

19:01.708 --> 19:02.809
How about a raise?

19:02.842 --> 19:03.943
Call it hazard pay.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.612
How about I plant
a piece on you

19:05.645 --> 19:06.479
and drop you off
at Central Booking?

19:06.513 --> 19:08.481
You ain't that kind
of cop, Reagan.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.382
Sometimes I
wish I was.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.351
Look, I really need
this one. Come on.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.352
Give me something.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.486
Billy Reese.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.322
Third-generation
goon, at least.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.957
I was up in Lewisburg
with his old man and his uncle.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.592
Legitimate tough guys.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.827
Nobody ever
looked funny at them.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.862
Even the made guys
called them mister.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.464
These Reeses,
they tend to come down

19:24.497 --> 19:25.665
on the side of labor
or management?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.500
Depends who pays the most.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.269
They sell muscle and mayhem.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.838
And they like it so much
they even do pro bono work.

19:31.871 --> 19:32.939
Great.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.741
Where can I find
this Reese character?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.243
The Reeses are out
of Throgs Neck.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.777
They never go too far
from the water

19:37.810 --> 19:39.379
unless they're going
to hurt someone.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.915
They own a joint up there
called, uh, the Sun Bright.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.252
Small businessmen, huh?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.220
Yeah, rumor has it they
made the previous owner

19:47.254 --> 19:48.988
an offer he didn't live
long enough to refuse.

19:49.021 --> 19:49.989
(engine starts)

19:50.022 --> 19:51.558
Right. Stay out
of trouble.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.293
Take it easy.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.565
(tape winds, clicks)

19:58.598 --> 20:00.500
MILO (over tape):
I'm not worried about me,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.569
but what about my family?

20:02.602 --> 20:03.770
What if something happens?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.272
ERIN:
Nothing is gonna happen.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.540
Your family is gonna be fine.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.941
It's my job to protect you.

20:08.975 --> 20:12.679
(tape clicks, winds)

20:12.712 --> 20:16.549
MILO:
I'm not worried about me,
but what about my family?

20:16.583 --> 20:17.717
What if something happens?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.419
ERIN:
Nothing is gonna happen.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.420
Mom?

20:20.453 --> 20:22.322
(tape clicks)

20:22.355 --> 20:24.557
Did you really get a man killed?

20:24.591 --> 20:25.758
Nicky...

20:28.428 --> 20:31.998
I overheard you talking
to Uncle Danny on the phone.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.234
I know what's being said
between the lines.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.940
There was a man...

20:40.973 --> 20:42.775
that was helping me make a case.

20:42.809 --> 20:43.910
An informant?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.979
Yeah.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.981
You cared about him.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.017
I can tell.

20:51.050 --> 20:54.721
Yeah, he was, uh...

20:54.754 --> 20:56.423
very nice.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.995
Are you going to catch
the man that killed him?

21:05.031 --> 21:06.699
I hope so, honey.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.750
This is Throgs
Neck, huh?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.552
Only people I ever
met from here:

21:25.585 --> 21:28.054
policemen, firemen,
hard hats and gangsters.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.055
Yeah?

21:29.088 --> 21:30.723
Well, my chiropractor's
from here.

21:30.757 --> 21:31.724
(sighs)

21:31.758 --> 21:34.794
That and most of the Local 9056.

21:40.066 --> 21:43.436
Well, looks like we got
the place to ourselves.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.741
Bottle's cold.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.678
(door opens)

21:51.711 --> 21:53.680
(door closes)
Yo, we're closed.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.549
So what are you doing here?
I work here, tough guy.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.651
Yeah? We're going to need to ask
you a few questions, tough guy.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.689
Hey!

22:13.700 --> 22:16.403
Hey! Hold on!

22:16.436 --> 22:17.437
Hey!

22:21.774 --> 22:22.975
Come here!

22:25.678 --> 22:27.814
Come here.
(coughing)

22:27.847 --> 22:28.748
(yells)
Oh, my arm!

22:28.781 --> 22:31.584
Ow, my arm! My arm's broken!

22:31.618 --> 22:32.752
What, this one,
Evel Knievel?

22:32.785 --> 22:33.986
Huh?

22:34.020 --> 22:35.488
Shut up. On your feet.

22:35.522 --> 22:38.725
JACKIE (over intercom):
You're going to have to do
better than this, Billy.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.693
Come on, do yourself
a favor, here.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.161
So all you got on this guy

22:42.194 --> 22:43.796
is leaving the abandoned
getaway car?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.598
I got him leaving
the abandoned getaway car,

22:45.632 --> 22:46.833
he fits the description
of the shooter,

22:46.866 --> 22:48.768
he had a pocketful of
stolen credit cards.

22:48.801 --> 22:49.869
This guy's dirty.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.171
Okay. That's a long way
to a murder conviction, Danny.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.773
We like him for
the shooter, Erin.

22:53.806 --> 22:57.544
The fact that he is
a member of local 9056

22:57.577 --> 23:00.179
at least ties him to
Milo and Driscoll.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.415
(sighs)

23:04.216 --> 23:05.552
JACKIE:
All right.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.687
I'm gonna try this again.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.921
Where were you Thursday night?

23:08.955 --> 23:09.922
I don't remember.

23:09.956 --> 23:10.823
(door closes)

23:10.857 --> 23:12.959
But, uh... I kind of wish
I was with you.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.661
Mmm.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.829
You are pretty hot
for an old lady.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.431
(Reese laughs)

23:18.465 --> 23:20.099
Did you know Ray Milo
was shot to death?

23:20.132 --> 23:21.734
REESE (over intercom):
Uh, there's a rumor
going around.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.703
Poor Ray.
(clicks tongue)

23:23.736 --> 23:25.472
He was a nice guy.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.573
Do you also know we
have pictures of you

23:26.606 --> 23:27.774
leaving the getaway car?

23:27.807 --> 23:30.643
And the description of the
shooter looks a lot like you.

23:30.677 --> 23:31.844
Must've been
a handsome bastard,

23:31.878 --> 23:33.813
this, uh...
mysterious shooter.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.482
DANNY:
No, actually he was
a sawed-off runt

23:35.515 --> 23:36.849
whose life never amounted
to squat.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.218
That's the description we got.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.587
And guess what?

23:40.620 --> 23:41.588
Now he's facing
the death penalty.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.823
New York ain't no
death penalty state, so...

23:43.856 --> 23:45.725
Really, boy genius? Well.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.060
We can make your case federal
with a simple phone call.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.196
Say hello to the assistant
district attorney.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.165
(whistles)

23:53.199 --> 23:55.134
It is raining hot mamas in here.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.805
Man, tell me you're not
tapping some of this.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.239
The only thing I'm gonna be
tapping is the glass wall

24:00.272 --> 24:01.908
at the death chamber,
when they're about to give you

24:01.941 --> 24:03.142
the hot shot, you got it,
jackass?

24:03.175 --> 24:05.645
(laughing)
Yeah, keep laughing.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.813
I'll make sure you wave to you.

24:06.846 --> 24:09.115
I ain't got nothing to do with
this, so keep laughing, too.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.784
ERIN: Would you like to hear
some of the crimes that quality

24:11.818 --> 24:13.586
under the federal
death penalty statute?

24:15.087 --> 24:17.790
Retaliatory murder of a witness,
victim or informant.

24:17.824 --> 24:18.791
Check.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.160
Murder for hire.
Check.

24:21.193 --> 24:24.096
Murder involving
a racketeering offense. Check.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.133
Do you need to know what
"racketeering" means, Mr. Reese?

24:27.166 --> 24:29.502
I ain't no snitch. Yeah.
Really?

24:29.536 --> 24:31.838
Is that going to be your grand
accomplishment in this life?

24:31.871 --> 24:33.706
(laughs)

24:36.142 --> 24:37.810
(door opens)
Wait. Wait.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.979
Wait.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.882
Nah, I'm just messing with you,
sweet cheeks.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.119
(Reese chuckling)

24:47.153 --> 24:49.689
You know what I got?
What?

24:50.723 --> 24:52.725
I've got my shooter,

24:52.759 --> 24:55.862
and a clear path
to the death penalty.

24:55.895 --> 25:00.066
So if you want to sit here
and be a tough guy, it's fine.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.072
I'm gonna go home
and get some sleep.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.792
(door opens)

25:26.859 --> 25:28.194
I was up with your boss...

25:30.930 --> 25:33.065
Just checking in.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.967
I'm fine, Dad.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.003
It's not my first tough case.

25:41.674 --> 25:44.076
I had this informant, and
I saw him at Yankee Stadium.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.178
Dad, I...
So I tried to pass on by,

25:46.212 --> 25:47.580
pretend I didn't know him,

25:47.614 --> 25:50.917
but he had a couple
of pops in him, stops,

25:50.950 --> 25:52.985
gives me a big hello,
shakes my hand.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.320
Three days later he's shot dead.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.123
Déjà vu.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.158
Was it because of me?

25:59.191 --> 26:02.595
Erin, this is
the business we're in.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.664
You can't make it personal.

26:06.132 --> 26:11.170
Yeah, but Ray Milo wasn't
a perp trying to buy a break.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.840
He was a whistle-blower
trying to do some good,

26:13.873 --> 26:17.610
and all he's got now is a widow
and some fatherless kids.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.279
Well, beating yourself up
isn't going to do him any good.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.852
I know.

26:28.888 --> 26:32.124
I'll leave you to it, then.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.795
Dad?

26:37.096 --> 26:39.231
My boss is in Washington today.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.267
Oh.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.839
You want to make amends,
catch his killer.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.343
(door opens)

26:51.377 --> 26:53.379
(door closes)

27:13.332 --> 27:15.334
(whispering):
Stay here, okay?

27:17.169 --> 27:19.739
ERIN:
Mrs. Milo.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.273
You haven't returned
my phone calls.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.310
I just wanted to let you know
that we arrested a man

27:24.343 --> 27:26.112
we believe shot your husband.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.915
That's just great for you.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.083
It's a real feather
in your cap, I bet.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.752
That don't bring my Ray back.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.854
But still, I thought
you might want...
BOY: Mom?

27:34.887 --> 27:37.790
You get the hell away from
what's left of my family.

27:38.958 --> 27:42.261
Get away and stay away!

27:42.294 --> 27:43.295
All the good you did my Ray.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.231
Now go on! Go!

27:45.264 --> 27:47.333
Nobody wants you here!

27:48.434 --> 27:51.170
Don't come back!

27:51.203 --> 27:52.939
We don't need your help!

27:52.972 --> 27:56.142
Don't call, and
don't come back!

27:56.175 --> 27:58.444
Just stay away from us!

28:01.280 --> 28:03.315
So if I told you that Jack

28:03.349 --> 28:06.118
flushed my army men
down a toilet,

28:06.152 --> 28:07.954
it would make me
an informant?

28:07.987 --> 28:09.388
No. No. If you snitch
on your brother,

28:09.421 --> 28:10.489
that makes you a tattletale.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.124
Ah, ah!

28:12.158 --> 28:13.359
Nice try, though, Sean.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.994
But if someone is
really doing something wrong,

28:15.027 --> 28:16.896
it's not tattling if you
tell a grown-up about it.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.265
FRANK:
Everybody's gonna know
what you did anyway.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.133
The way things are going,
every move they make's

28:21.167 --> 28:23.035
gonna be recorded
by a camera somewhere.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.904
Everything?

28:24.937 --> 28:27.273
So always tell the truth.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.742
JAMIE:
Think about it.
All the surveillance we have

28:29.776 --> 28:31.277
keeps the streets safe
and makes our jobs easier,

28:31.310 --> 28:32.411
but it's a double-edged sword.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.180
DANNY:
I don't know. You got nothing

28:34.213 --> 28:35.281
to hide, you got nothing
to worry about.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.382
JAMIE:
Well, we don't know if this

28:36.415 --> 28:38.785
Officer Acosta had something
to hide or not yet, right?

28:38.818 --> 28:40.452
Yeah, but he's being tried
on a zillion screens

28:40.486 --> 28:41.653
because of that video.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.856
Yeah, I saw an Auto-Tune remix
of it on Gawker this morning.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.358
I don't even want to know
what that is.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.060
Big Brother is watching.
Exactly, but...

28:48.094 --> 28:51.230
now everybody has access,
so everybody's watching.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.833
Well, I don't know what you
call it, but it's not progress.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.267
Still say you got
nothing to hide,

28:55.301 --> 28:57.069
you got nothing to worry about.
FRANK:
Okay, Danny.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.238
Did you know that I.A.
had a hidden camera

28:59.271 --> 29:01.073
in the interrogation room
in your precinct?

29:06.512 --> 29:08.480
For a split second...

29:08.514 --> 29:10.182
(laughing)

29:10.216 --> 29:10.983
Busted!

29:11.017 --> 29:13.352
(laughing)

29:13.385 --> 29:16.322
Who's busted for what?

29:16.355 --> 29:18.190
Danny. For sainthood.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.492
Boy, in what world
does that exist?

29:20.526 --> 29:22.428
Hey, Mom.
Hi, honey.
I'm sorry I'm late.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.796
HENRY:
Pass the butter, please.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.034
That's better.
Better than what?

29:28.067 --> 29:29.468
Better than the rest
of my day so far.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.204
I'll get you some wine.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.505
Oh, I can get that, Frank.
No.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.507
You're busy
being married to a saint.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.109
(Henry chuckles)

29:37.143 --> 29:38.110
HENRY:
Got you again.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.378
What?
Got you twice.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.247
JACK:
Dad's a saint.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.350
Hey.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.952
JACKIE:
Hey.

29:45.985 --> 29:46.886
What's going on?

29:46.919 --> 29:48.354
Well, I've been running
through the activity

29:48.387 --> 29:50.256
on Reese's stolen credit card.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.058
Uh, this guy's
been living it up.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.360
A half dozen bars,
restaurants,

29:54.393 --> 29:56.395
and three massage parlors.
Well, you know,

29:56.428 --> 29:58.965
even hired killers need a little
stress relief from time to time.

29:58.998 --> 29:59.899
Check this one out, though.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.434
Liquor store, 30 minutes
after Milo was shot.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.170
A liquor store, huh?
Mmm.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.238
Looks like he went for that
celebratory drink after all.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.506
Great. Let's go
check this place out.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.041
Yeah.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.910
Hey.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.846
What's up, sis?

30:13.880 --> 30:16.115
Uh-oh. You got that look
in your eye.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.516
I went to see the wife,

30:17.549 --> 30:19.118
yesterday, before dinner.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.987
Okay, you really
need to stop wallowing.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.122
Well, I was wallowing,
but I went to see her,

30:23.155 --> 30:25.958
and it didn't register
with me right away,

30:25.992 --> 30:27.626
but I told her that
we had arrested someone

30:27.659 --> 30:29.161
for killing her husband.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.496
And?

30:30.529 --> 30:33.099
And nothing. She didn't
even ask me who it was.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.301
I mean, wouldn't you
be a little curious?

30:35.334 --> 30:37.036
Well, yeah. I mean,
I suppose I'd be curious.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.470
But didn't we
check the wife out?

30:38.504 --> 30:40.106
Yeah, we checked her out,

30:40.139 --> 30:43.275
and there's no history of
domestic problems, no 911 calls,

30:43.309 --> 30:44.944
no new insurance policy.

30:44.977 --> 30:48.114
I had our tech guys dive into
the Milos' home computer.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.450
Someone had Googled divorce
lawyers two dozen times.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.652
Well, you know,
it could've been Milo.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.555
Most of the time stamps
show that he was with me.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.058
Okay.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.392
I'll check out
the liquor store myself.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.995
You two see what you can
dig up on the Merry Widow.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.501
Yeah, right.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.569
So, regift it, Jerry.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.671
You must know somebody
who has respect for the NYPD.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.473
Never said I didn't.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.308
Not in so many words.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.110
But actions speak louder than.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.547
Is Reagan really
stopping by?

31:21.580 --> 31:23.282
He's the one who asked me
to invite you up here.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.318
I'm not giving up my reputation
for a swag bag

31:26.352 --> 31:27.586
and a handshake
from the commish.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.621
Nobody asked you to.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.460
Hello, Jerry.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.462
Thanks for coming.
No biggie, Commissioner.

31:36.495 --> 31:39.231
This building's been my beat
for a long, long time.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.533
I know that.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.035
I just wanted to thank you,

31:43.069 --> 31:44.570
personally,
for bringing that

31:44.603 --> 31:46.605
video to the public's attention.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.474
(laughs)
Wh... seriously.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.142
Well, listen.

31:50.176 --> 31:52.611
You know I haven't always agreed
with your take on things,

31:52.644 --> 31:54.680
but for once, you and I
are on the same side.

31:54.713 --> 31:58.217
Well, I just thought people
have the right to know.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.053
FRANK:
And to have complete confidence
in their police force, so...

32:01.087 --> 32:03.222
I want you to know
that I'm seeing to it

32:03.255 --> 32:04.991
that Office Acosta
is held accountable.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.492
Well, that would be
the right thing to do.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.027
FRANK:
Now, the district attorney

32:08.060 --> 32:10.462
is taking the case
to the grand jury, so of course

32:10.496 --> 32:12.999
to present the case,
he will need the original tape.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.633
Okay.

32:14.666 --> 32:18.337
The full, complete, unedited

32:18.370 --> 32:20.372
original tape.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.709
And this...

32:25.544 --> 32:29.248
...is a subpoena for that tape.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.551
The unedited tape.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.586
(paper rustling)

32:38.257 --> 32:40.559
Well, I-I, uh...

32:40.592 --> 32:42.294
guess I can check through
my files.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.163
Great. You want to run home
and get it?

32:45.197 --> 32:47.699
I'm sure we don't
need to remind you

32:47.733 --> 32:50.202
what it means to ignore
a grand jury subpoena.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.106
Thanks for stopping by.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.544
You guys...

32:58.577 --> 33:00.679
Wow.

33:00.712 --> 33:03.449
Thought you'd want to be
the first to know.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.683
From the Dumpster

33:04.716 --> 33:06.418
behind Laddie Liquors,

33:06.452 --> 33:07.553
right where Billy Reese stopped

33:07.586 --> 33:09.721
30 minutes after Ray Milo
was shot.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.323
You tie it to Reese
and the shooting?

33:11.357 --> 33:13.425
Not yet, but I'm a betting man.

33:13.459 --> 33:14.626
What about you and Jackie?

33:14.660 --> 33:16.328
You come up with anything
on Mrs. Milo?

33:16.362 --> 33:18.630
Ran her credit cards.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.699
She's been checking
into the Winston Hotel

33:20.732 --> 33:22.668
under her maiden name.
Nice place.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.570
She has good taste.
Yeah.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.705
Reese thought so, too.
Reese?

33:26.738 --> 33:28.674
Some of the charges
on his stolen credit cards

33:28.707 --> 33:31.310
are from the lobby bar
at the Winston Hotel.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.212
Huh. A killer and a lover.
Or a killer

33:33.245 --> 33:34.213
hired by a lover.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.714
Which could mean that Ray Milo
was not killed

33:35.747 --> 33:36.582
because he was your lackey.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.351
You may be off the hook
after all, sis.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.386
Go find out?

33:40.419 --> 33:42.588
I'm all over it.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.733
What a sad sack.
Mm-hmm.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.368
Do we really think
that Jenna Milo

33:56.402 --> 33:57.669
slept with this
potato head?

33:57.703 --> 33:58.804
Ooh. No way.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.506
She'd definitely
be trading down.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.673
Definitely trading down.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.841
(groaning sigh)

34:02.874 --> 34:04.576
Let's not tell him
we think that.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.512
No.

34:08.414 --> 34:09.481
Mmm.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.550
Well, it's nice
to see her again.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.586
But I'll tell you, I am sick
and tired of sitting here

34:14.620 --> 34:15.821
for a stolen credit card.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.289
Why don't you
ship me to Rikers

34:17.323 --> 34:18.690
and go hassle
some real criminals,

34:18.724 --> 34:21.593
like someone who was, uh,
jaywalking or something?

34:21.627 --> 34:24.096
(chuckling)

34:24.130 --> 34:26.198
Yeah, funny guy.
Yeah.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.299
How long you think that smile's
going to be on his face?

34:27.333 --> 34:30.402
I'd say ten, 15 seconds,
depending how fast you speak.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.537
Well, we got good
news and bad news.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.805
The bad news is we found the gun
right where you left it

34:33.839 --> 34:35.841
behind Laddie Liquors with
your fingerprints on it

34:35.874 --> 34:36.908
in the Dumpster

34:36.942 --> 34:39.111
with the ballistics
matching the murder weapon.

34:39.145 --> 34:42.080
Good news is-- we decided
to drop the credit card charges.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.517
So I guess today's
your lucky day.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.818
So, laugh it up
now, fun boy.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.255
No, no, um, you know
that lady D.A.?

34:49.288 --> 34:51.323
Maybe I want to talk
to her again.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.591
Well, that deal
is off the table

34:52.624 --> 34:54.360
'cause you got nothing
to offer in trade.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.861
No, she wanted to know
who hired me.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.229
Well, nobody hired you, right?

34:57.263 --> 34:58.797
I mean, she must have been
misinformed.

34:58.830 --> 34:59.798
You said nobody hired you,

34:59.831 --> 35:02.301
so that means you did it
all by your lonesome.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.702
Yeah, but what do I got
against Ray Milo?

35:03.735 --> 35:04.870
The fact that you want his wife.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.173
(chuckles)
I don't even know his wife.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.907
Sure you did. You met her
at the Winston Hotel.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.075
I mean,
we know you were there.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.811
You remember the stolen
credit cards, right, Einstein?

35:12.844 --> 35:14.680
We also know she was there
at the same time.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.715
See? Two plus two.
And we also know

35:16.748 --> 35:18.617
that you do like hot mamas.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.885
I mean, you did
tell us that.

35:19.918 --> 35:21.887
Yeah, and you love them
hot mamas, don't you?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.622
See, you did
it solo,

35:23.655 --> 35:25.257
so you go down solo.

35:25.291 --> 35:28.327
You got nothing to offer,
so you get no deal.

35:29.761 --> 35:30.896
All right, wait.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.731
Okay, I was at that hotel.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.334
But I wasn't
meeting her.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.837
Man, he must have been
upstairs tapping her.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.406
Then he came
downstairs.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.174
Yeah, and he met me in the bar.
Hey.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.442
What are you talking about?

35:43.475 --> 35:44.943
Who was tapping Ray Milo's wife?

35:44.976 --> 35:46.945
I get that deal--
no death penalty?

35:46.978 --> 35:48.514
You give us something real,
maybe you get a deal.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.581
Now, what are you talking about?

35:49.615 --> 35:50.649
Real enough.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.783
He paid me ten grand.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.552
Who are we talking about here?

35:53.585 --> 35:55.153
Driscoll?

35:56.355 --> 35:58.190
The construction guy.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.625
Parker.

36:06.865 --> 36:07.966
DANNY (over phone):
Parker, the contractor.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.435
Parker?

36:09.468 --> 36:11.470
Yeah, look,
whatever kind of dirty dealings

36:11.503 --> 36:12.971
this Driscoll guy had going on,

36:13.004 --> 36:14.640
Parker obviously had
dirty dealings

36:14.673 --> 36:16.575
going on of his own,
and as an informant,

36:16.608 --> 36:18.577
Milo could have brought
either one of them down,

36:18.610 --> 36:22.414
but only one of them is sleeping
with Milo's wife-- Parker.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.615
Bring him in.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.284
No. Hold on.
Parker's not some kind of punk.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.319
Okay? He's not a Billy Reese
type of character.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.787
He's going to come in
with serious lawyers.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.289
You got to be ready for that.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.224
Yeah, and I'm a pretty good
lawyer myself.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.526
How did Parker know
that Milo was wearing a wire?

36:34.560 --> 36:35.961
Well, how else would he know?

36:35.994 --> 36:37.529
Mrs. Milo.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.267
I want her.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.873
BROWNE:
Ten-hut!

36:51.042 --> 36:54.313
(Frank speaking
indistinctly)

36:54.346 --> 36:55.347
(continues indistinctly)

36:55.381 --> 36:57.383
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.251
Commissioner Reagan
has some new information

36:59.285 --> 37:00.686
he'd like to share with you.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.254
As you were.

37:08.494 --> 37:11.797
The unedited video of
the incident in question

37:11.830 --> 37:16.034
is being disseminated to all
media outlets as we speak,

37:16.067 --> 37:18.304
but I wanted
Officer Acosta--

37:18.337 --> 37:22.408
and all of you-- to
hear it from me first.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.511
The full version makes it clear

37:25.544 --> 37:29.348
that Officer Acosta
acted professionally

37:29.381 --> 37:33.919
and in a manner that
reflects well on all of us.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.055
Couple of takeaways here.

37:37.088 --> 37:40.326
First, I want you to know this.

37:40.359 --> 37:44.963
If you do your job correctly,
I will back you to the hilt.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.465
Always.

37:46.498 --> 37:47.866
Secondly,

37:47.899 --> 37:49.835
cameras are everywhere.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.904
It's the world we live in.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.807
But if your first duty
is to protect the public,

37:55.841 --> 38:00.712
right behind it is your duty
to get back here in one piece.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.482
And how you
look on film

38:03.515 --> 38:06.318
is way down the list.

38:06.352 --> 38:07.753
Captain?

38:07.786 --> 38:08.887
Officer Acosta.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.422
Front and center!

38:14.526 --> 38:15.861
You're restored to full duty.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.065
Thank you, sir.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.338
Be careful out there.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.744
(applause)

38:43.889 --> 38:46.525
(door opens)

38:51.397 --> 38:52.498
(door closes)

38:52.531 --> 38:53.999
What are you doing here?

38:54.032 --> 38:57.102
The cops told me they wanted
to give me an update.

38:58.737 --> 39:03.041
I've been wondering
about your husband's case.

39:03.074 --> 39:07.379
Keep asking myself,
did I push him too far,

39:07.413 --> 39:11.450
too fast, to a place
where he couldn't go?

39:12.751 --> 39:15.387
Well, he's dead
because of you, isn't he?

39:20.058 --> 39:22.461
My daughter...

39:22.494 --> 39:24.463
she asked me

39:24.496 --> 39:27.699
if I was responsible
for getting a man killed.

39:27.733 --> 39:31.437
That is a hell of a question
to hear your kid ask you.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.506
But it's okay.

39:35.941 --> 39:40.612
'Cause I can tell her,
"No, I'm not."

39:40.646 --> 39:43.515
But you can't really
say the same, can you?

39:47.218 --> 39:49.621
(laughing)

39:49.655 --> 39:51.490
You must need a psychiatrist.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.058
What the hell
are you talking about?

39:56.562 --> 39:58.163
We know everything.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.865
I should sue you people.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.734
We know about
the Winston Hotel.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.871
I get my hair cut there.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.172
There's a salon.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.740
Yeah, Vittore's. I know.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.542
I've... I've had my hair
done there.

40:10.576 --> 40:11.943
We'll check
with their records

40:11.977 --> 40:13.545
and see how often
you go in.

40:13.579 --> 40:16.181
It's probably not as often
as you register

40:16.214 --> 40:20.185
at the front desk of the hotel
under your maiden name.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.688
So when we show
your picture

40:22.721 --> 40:24.122
and Ron Parker's,
do you really think

40:24.155 --> 40:26.458
that no one's going to put
the two of you together?

40:29.160 --> 40:31.997
So... I had an affair.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.065
With the man
who murdered your husband.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.834
That's crazy.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.836
We have the guy he hired.

40:37.869 --> 40:41.907
He told us Ron Parker hired him
at the bar of the Winston Hotel.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.475
Ron Parker is a good guy.

40:43.509 --> 40:44.610
And your husband wasn't?

40:44.643 --> 40:46.111
He was working for you.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.682
He told you that.

40:50.716 --> 40:52.484
He trusted you,

40:52.518 --> 40:54.185
and you ran off
and told your boyfriend

40:54.219 --> 40:55.687
'cause you knew
what he would do.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.523
No, I didn't.
You told him

40:57.556 --> 40:59.491
because you knew
he would kill your husband

40:59.525 --> 41:00.959
to keep himself out of prison.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.495
You chose that crook
over your husband.

41:03.529 --> 41:04.362
I don't know
what fancy-ass place

41:04.395 --> 41:06.264
you grew up in,
but where I come from,

41:06.297 --> 41:08.534
there is nothing worse
in this life than a rat.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.636
That rat...

41:10.669 --> 41:13.071
was the father
of your children.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.807
He stood up for what was right.

41:15.841 --> 41:19.578
And where I come from,
that means everything.

41:27.553 --> 41:30.656
Pick up
that punk Parker.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.658
That's my kid sister.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.293
