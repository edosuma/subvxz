00:02.573 --> 00:04.221
<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:04.222 --> 00:06.142
I shouldn't have performed your
song without your permission.

00:06.143 --> 00:09.109
- You wanna get the hell outta here?
- That's the best offer I've had all night.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.411
I can't sing.

00:10.412 --> 00:12.613
Her throat is still
sore from the intubation.

00:12.614 --> 00:14.582
- I gotta cancel the tour.
- What?

00:14.583 --> 00:15.858
Thanks for coming by.

00:15.859 --> 00:18.061
- I'm gonna need an opening act, and...
-  Are you serious?

00:18.062 --> 00:19.920
You're a bad, bad man.

00:19.921 --> 00:21.188
See, now you get me.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.990
Your boyfriend's got a
little crush on my guitar.

00:22.991 --> 00:24.324
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.924
He's just on the payroll.

00:25.925 --> 00:29.663
Kickbacks, payoffs, illegal contributions.

00:29.664 --> 00:31.264
He needs to be punished.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.571
Deacon, there's coffee in
the kitchen if you want some.

00:37.572 --> 00:40.272
I'm not Deacon, but thank you.

00:40.273 --> 00:41.540
- Scarlett, right?
-  I'm sorry.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.141
Oh. Hey.

00:43.142 --> 00:44.744
I thought you were gonna be at
your friend Zoey's last night,

00:44.745 --> 00:47.246
- isn't that what you were gonna do?
- No.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.234
You got something to say?

00:49.235 --> 00:51.155
No, I'm gonna go do some media training,

00:51.156 --> 00:52.618
'cause I need to.

00:53.060 --> 00:55.185
Glad you moved on.

00:55.186 --> 00:56.654
Nice to see you again.

00:56.655 --> 00:58.790
And you.

01:00.459 --> 01:02.159
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that she was gonna be here.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.061
I swear. Um, you okay?

01:04.062 --> 01:05.462
I mean, I'm not having second thoughts,

01:05.464 --> 01:07.469
if that's what you're worried about.

01:07.470 --> 01:09.367
- Well, good, 'cause I'm not either.
- Okay, good.

01:09.368 --> 01:11.168
I should probably get moving, too.

01:11.169 --> 01:13.837
- Busy day at the office.
- Oh, oh, yeah. Everyone's got a busy day.

01:13.838 --> 01:15.205
You got stuff to do. She's got stuff to do.

01:15.206 --> 01:19.013
Me? I'm probably gonna
read the instruction booklet

01:19.014 --> 01:20.844
- to my new deep fryer.
-  Mm.

01:20.845 --> 01:23.747
You know, check that
out for a little while.

01:23.748 --> 01:25.916
Nice.

01:25.917 --> 01:27.917
- It just feels different.
- Try again.

01:27.918 --> 01:29.118
Just give me...

01:29.119 --> 01:30.286
♪ No, no, no

01:30.287 --> 01:31.954
♪ No, no, no

01:31.955 --> 01:35.059
it's still catching. It still feels tight.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.259
- It can happen with scar tissue.
- I feel like...

01:37.260 --> 01:39.116
- I feel like I'm never gonna heal.
- Hopefully, you will.

01:39.117 --> 01:40.162
How soon, you think?

01:40.163 --> 01:41.898
It's hard to tell.

01:41.899 --> 01:43.498
Healing is halted by anxiety.

01:43.499 --> 01:45.409
It's why you're feeling tense and tight.

01:45.410 --> 01:46.768
Feel the resonance in your mask.

01:46.769 --> 01:49.237
Give me... mm-mm, one.

01:49.238 --> 01:50.539
Mm-mm, one.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.206
- Mm-mm, two.
- Mm-mm, two.

01:52.207 --> 01:54.510
- Keep going to
nine. - Mm-mm, three.

01:54.511 --> 01:55.710
Mm-mm, four.

01:55.711 --> 01:58.581
I am so excited to get out on the road

01:58.582 --> 02:01.264
with my new "Inside The Dream" tour

02:01.265 --> 02:04.234
and introduce my new album to all my fans.

02:04.235 --> 02:06.086
And I think they are
really gonna love this show.

02:06.087 --> 02:07.275
They really are.

02:07.276 --> 02:08.756
I think it's the most exciting one yet.

02:08.757 --> 02:10.902
Juliette, uh, first of
all, congratulations to you

02:10.904 --> 02:14.094
on winning the, uh, CMA
Female vocalist of the year.

02:14.095 --> 02:16.128
How do you follow something like that?

02:16.129 --> 02:18.898
I'm just trying to live
in the moment, you know?

02:18.899 --> 02:21.233
I'm trying to appreciate what I have now.

02:21.614 --> 02:23.734
Although there are a couple gems

02:23.735 --> 02:25.204
that I wouldn't mind adding to my crown.

02:25.205 --> 02:27.306
Is one of those gems someone special

02:27.307 --> 02:28.859
to share your success with?

02:28.860 --> 02:31.210
I don't need one someone special.

02:31.211 --> 02:32.410
I've got millions of someone specials,

02:32.411 --> 02:35.547
and I hope they come out and enjoy my tour.

02:35.548 --> 02:37.647
So did Rayna Jaymes cancel the final leg

02:37.648 --> 02:39.317
of the "Red Lips, White Lies" tour

02:39.318 --> 02:41.785
because the accident damaged her voice?

02:41.786 --> 02:44.222
Now you know better than
to go spreading rumors,

02:44.223 --> 02:45.724
especially false ones.

02:45.725 --> 02:48.616
She is staying home to
spend time with her girls.

02:48.617 --> 02:50.292
And I'm fully supportive of that,

02:50.293 --> 02:53.016
and not just because I get
to headline on my own again.

02:54.366 --> 02:57.427
The publicity stills from
the photo shoot are gorgeous.

02:58.033 --> 02:59.193
You are gonna knock them dead

02:59.194 --> 03:01.278
at Luke Wheeler's benefit
concert tomorrow night.

03:01.279 --> 03:02.625
And we're gonna make sure you sound

03:02.626 --> 03:04.402
as fabulous as you look.

03:04.403 --> 03:06.344
Well, I'm not even performing, am I?

03:06.345 --> 03:09.380
No, but we're having all
of our up-and-coming artists

03:09.381 --> 03:10.146
walk the press line.

03:10.147 --> 03:12.215
Let's start with an easy question.

03:12.216 --> 03:15.070
When did you first know
you wanted to be a singer?

03:15.071 --> 03:16.373
Uh... I didn't.

03:16.374 --> 03:19.289
Um, I-it's kind of
funny. I-I didn't know

03:19.290 --> 03:21.383
that I wanted to be a singer.
I just really liked singing.

03:21.384 --> 03:23.179
So I wrote poems, and...

03:23.180 --> 03:25.492
O-okay, let's stop for a second.

03:25.493 --> 03:28.491
First thing we need to work
on is your presentation.

03:28.492 --> 03:30.611
In certain situations, the stammering

03:30.612 --> 03:33.350
comes across as folksy, but
when the camera's on you,

03:33.351 --> 03:34.737
it'll read as scattered.

03:34.738 --> 03:37.446
Try to be more poised and confident.

03:37.863 --> 03:38.873
- I can do that.
- Great.

03:38.874 --> 03:40.963
Now we also need to work on your story.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.043
What about it?

03:42.044 --> 03:44.242
You can't say that you never wanted this.

03:44.243 --> 03:46.995
People will resent your success.

03:46.996 --> 03:50.300
Well, I didn't... not want it. I just...

03:50.301 --> 03:53.004
Never expected it to happen, that's all.

03:53.005 --> 03:55.557
It's, uh... I don't want to lie to people.

03:55.558 --> 03:56.505
And you won't have to.

03:56.506 --> 03:58.411
We're gonna use facts from your life

03:58.412 --> 04:00.006
to craft a compelling story.

04:00.007 --> 04:00.872
Okay?

04:00.873 --> 04:02.796
For the encore, I'll make my entrance

04:02.797 --> 04:04.335
through the 3-d video screen.

04:04.336 --> 04:05.465
Good. You're here.

04:05.466 --> 04:07.582
Um, Edgehill's publicity
department is doing

04:07.583 --> 04:09.468
a behind-the-scenes
video about me...

04:09.469 --> 04:11.170
Getting ready for my first big tour.

04:11.171 --> 04:13.806
You mean your little spot on my big tour?

04:13.807 --> 04:15.708
Yes. We were just hoping to
get some interviews with you

04:15.709 --> 04:18.844
- about why you invited me...
- I'll tell you what.

04:18.845 --> 04:20.813
Now is not a good time,

04:20.814 --> 04:23.058
but why don't you have the
producers contact Glenn,

04:23.059 --> 04:25.850
- and he will set something up?
- Okay, great.

04:25.851 --> 04:28.954
Thanks. Bye.

04:28.955 --> 04:30.889
You got some time later this week.

04:30.890 --> 04:33.162
Please tell me it's not
too late to get rid of her.

04:33.163 --> 04:34.926
No, it's way too late. Yeah.

04:34.927 --> 04:37.110
Fine. You know what? If
I can't get rid of her,

04:37.111 --> 04:38.704
I'm just gonna have to figure out

04:38.705 --> 04:41.366
a way to limit her time on stage...

04:41.367 --> 04:42.733
<i>My stage.</i>

04:42.734 --> 04:44.668
How was Scarlett's media training?

04:44.669 --> 04:47.141
Uh, she's, uh, overthinking it.

04:47.142 --> 04:49.205
Do I need to step in and
help out a little bit?

04:49.206 --> 04:50.941
No, it'll be fine. Okay.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.915
Good news, bad news...
What do you want first?

04:52.916 --> 04:54.756
I always want the good
news. What's the good news?

04:54.757 --> 04:56.445
Steve Buchanan and Pete Fisher...

04:56.446 --> 04:58.614
- Love.
- Yes, they love you.

04:58.615 --> 04:59.882
They want to know if you'd be willing

04:59.883 --> 05:02.576
to invite Juliette to
be a member of the Opry.

05:02.577 --> 05:03.810
They want you to do it tomorrow night

05:03.811 --> 05:06.316
at Luke Wheeler's "Youthful Noise" concert.

05:07.992 --> 05:10.140
And dress code is "denim and diamonds,"

05:10.141 --> 05:12.714
- if that matters to you.
- What's the bad news?

05:13.173 --> 05:14.789
Jeff Fordham called.

05:14.790 --> 05:15.597
Mnh.

05:15.598 --> 05:17.167
You didn't sing at the
stockholder showcase.

05:17.168 --> 05:18.333
You dropped out of the tour.

05:18.334 --> 05:20.840
So he is convinced that you
are never going to sing again.

05:20.841 --> 05:22.815
Well, he's wrong and he's a jackass.

05:22.816 --> 05:23.926
Well, be that as it may,

05:23.927 --> 05:25.950
he's demanding the
masters for the new album.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.487
Well, the new album isn't finished.

05:27.488 --> 05:29.539
Liam's in Europe. He can't do that.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.278
Well, unless you have
the money to walk away

05:31.279 --> 05:33.488
from the label and take
the album with you, he can.

05:33.489 --> 05:34.636
Edgehill owns it.

05:34.637 --> 05:36.036
And these are his words...

05:36.037 --> 05:38.623
"Before all the goodwill from the fans

05:38.624 --> 05:41.473
after the accident is
gone, he wants to release

05:41.474 --> 05:43.837
Rayna Jaymes' final album, just in case."

05:43.838 --> 05:45.104
Rayna Jaymes' fi...

05:46.593 --> 05:49.763
I really think it's time that Jeff Fordham

05:49.764 --> 05:53.013
met the Wyatt side of Rayna Jaymes.

06:08.277 --> 06:10.044
Now that makes the joint look classy.

06:10.045 --> 06:11.733
Hey, it's our way of saying

06:11.734 --> 06:12.280
we're happy to have you here, man.

06:12.281 --> 06:14.173
Well, I am happy to be here.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.441
The old label was content
to just put out my albums

06:16.442 --> 06:17.651
and send me on tour.

06:17.652 --> 06:20.679
Multi-platinum albums,
sold-out stadium tours.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.262
True, but it's nice to be with someone

06:22.263 --> 06:23.891
who understands that's
just the tip of the iceberg.

06:23.892 --> 06:25.558
You and me are gonna
do big things together.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.227
- Now I'll see you tomorrow at the benefit?
- Wouldn't miss it.

06:27.228 --> 06:28.561
Just a matter of time before

06:28.562 --> 06:30.230
you're an even bigger star than he is.

06:30.231 --> 06:33.033
I'm not the one about to
open up on an arena tour.

06:33.034 --> 06:34.867
Juliette Barnes really
invite you over to her house

06:34.868 --> 06:36.469
- to ask you personally?
- Yep.

06:36.470 --> 06:39.753
But, um... if you were
to ask me a few weeks ago

06:39.754 --> 06:41.384
which Edgehill artist I thought

06:41.385 --> 06:43.196
would be the first to invite over, I...

06:43.197 --> 06:45.220
I would have guessed Will Lexington.

06:45.221 --> 06:46.212
Hi, guys.

06:46.213 --> 06:49.636
There she is... prettiest
singer in all of Tennessee.

06:49.637 --> 06:51.650
- Thank you.
- Come here!

06:51.651 --> 06:54.802
Oh, I just got my brain
rearranged upstairs.

06:54.803 --> 06:56.288
Hi.

06:56.289 --> 06:57.615
- Oh, that was so weird.
- Scarlett, don't worry about

06:57.616 --> 06:59.817
- the red carpet stuff, you're gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.795
You ready to get started?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.676
Yeah, just... Give me one second.

07:03.677 --> 07:05.973
Jeff? Jeff, wait up!

07:06.673 --> 07:07.198
Hmm. That's funny.

07:07.199 --> 07:09.624
I didn't realize that you
and Will were so close.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.336
Oh. We're friends. That's all.

07:12.337 --> 07:15.239
Hey, man. I'm sorry about that
mix-up with my buddy's song.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.115
The thing about rookie mistakes, Will,

07:17.116 --> 07:18.761
is the more you make...

07:18.762 --> 07:21.310
The longer you stay a rookie.

07:23.648 --> 07:25.149
Don't worry about him.

07:25.475 --> 07:26.917
I'll smooth it over.

07:27.596 --> 07:29.173
I don't need your help.

07:30.587 --> 07:33.756
We are here to formalize
the terms of your deal

07:33.757 --> 07:35.391
in exchange for the information

07:35.392 --> 07:37.526
that you turned over on your father.

07:37.527 --> 07:39.228
We expect full immunity.

07:39.229 --> 07:41.297
In order for that to happen, Ms. Hampton,

07:41.298 --> 07:44.772
you cannot speak to anyone,
including your sister,

07:44.773 --> 07:45.600
about this investigation

07:45.601 --> 07:48.722
or your father's involvement
in your mother's death.

07:48.723 --> 07:49.804
Absolutely not.

07:49.805 --> 07:52.547
- I can't keep that from her.
- You're going to have to.

07:52.548 --> 07:54.901
We can't run the risk of
your father getting wind

07:54.902 --> 07:56.785
of this investigation and fleeing.

07:56.786 --> 07:59.395
You wouldn't have an
investigation without me.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.739
True, but if you refuse
to abide by this gag order,

08:02.740 --> 08:04.952
you will be charged as a co-conspirator

08:04.953 --> 08:09.290
in a case that exposes many
powerful people to prosecution.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.925
Now believe me when I say that silence

08:11.926 --> 08:15.096
is the best protection
for you and your family.

08:16.732 --> 08:18.580
Take the deal.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.322
I'm thinking I need to leave Edgehill,

08:35.323 --> 08:37.943
and I want to take Highway 65 with me

08:37.945 --> 08:40.201
and be my own boss.

08:40.202 --> 08:42.489
- Well, that's
my girl. - Mm-hmm.

08:42.490 --> 08:44.207
It's gonna have to happen fast.

08:44.208 --> 08:45.647
Not gonna be cheap.

08:45.648 --> 08:47.893
I need to take everything with me,

08:47.894 --> 08:49.576
especially the masters of the album

08:49.577 --> 08:50.018
I've been working on.

08:50.019 --> 08:51.996
- Mm-hmm.
- All of it.

08:51.997 --> 08:54.453
You know, I have to say, I
never thought I'd see the day

08:54.454 --> 08:56.034
when you'd be asking for help.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.170
Yeah, well...

08:59.171 --> 09:00.838
It's not my favorite thing to do.

09:00.839 --> 09:03.307
But with everything that's happened,

09:03.308 --> 09:05.542
I sure realize the value
of family more than ever,

09:05.543 --> 09:07.911
and...

09:07.912 --> 09:10.589
A family business may
not be such a bad idea.

09:10.590 --> 09:12.424
So how much you gonna need?

09:13.031 --> 09:14.811
I'm thinking $20 million.

09:14.812 --> 09:17.127
But now... now, that would not be a gift.

09:17.128 --> 09:19.360
That would be with you as an investor.

09:19.675 --> 09:22.069
I'll have the paperwork drawn up.

09:22.886 --> 09:24.558
Thank you, daddy.

S-something wrong?

10:23.150 --> 10:25.122
Just, I think this would sound amazing

10:25.123 --> 10:27.137
with a female voice in the mix.

10:27.138 --> 10:29.721
I don't know. It sounds
kinda cool right now.

10:29.722 --> 10:31.868
Just think of someone
that has real range...

10:31.869 --> 10:33.567
You know, complements us.

10:34.483 --> 10:35.897
We should ask Zoey.

10:35.898 --> 10:38.649
I've heard her sing in church
at Natchez with Scarlett.

10:39.559 --> 10:41.813
I think her voice would just be incredible.

10:41.814 --> 10:43.792
Yeah, it might be kinda awkward, though.

10:43.793 --> 10:47.240
You know, Scarlett's
told her stuff about me,

10:47.241 --> 10:48.682
and...  She probably knows

10:48.683 --> 10:50.732
a lot of stuff about you, too. So...

10:50.733 --> 10:52.462
That's just how chicks are, man.

10:52.463 --> 10:54.013
It'll be fine.

10:55.665 --> 10:56.912
All right.

10:57.316 --> 10:59.799
I can't believe after all
the times you said no to this,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.050
you're finally thinking about it.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.620
Yeah, well, that's what I'm doin'.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.427
All right, so I, uh, buy in,
I give you a bunch of money,

11:06.428 --> 11:08.439
you put my name over
the door. And then what?

11:08.440 --> 11:11.248
Well... uh, you'd be
as involved as you want

11:11.249 --> 11:13.690
in the day-to-day. We
got about 500 in stock,

11:13.691 --> 11:15.764
but I'm always checking
auctions and estate sales

11:15.765 --> 11:18.534
for vintage inventory. I mean...

11:18.535 --> 11:20.469
Your eye would be good for that.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.471
Uh, can I help you?

11:22.891 --> 11:26.066
Yeah. I'm looking for something
with a big bluesy sound.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.505
I'd like to keep it
around $1,500, if possible.

11:30.996 --> 11:33.800
A lot of guys like that rosewood, but, uh,

11:33.801 --> 11:35.334
I like the mahogany.

11:35.704 --> 11:38.040
It's a little more clear, you know?

11:41.156 --> 11:42.657
See, that's got a good cut.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.424
That's that double-o, but,
uh, it's got a big sound to it.

11:45.425 --> 11:48.828
You wanna move your budget a little
bit, try the Martin triple-o's.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.689
Worth it.

11:50.690 --> 11:51.964
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:52.398 --> 11:54.601
Hey. You're that guitar player...

11:54.602 --> 11:55.635
Deacon Claybourne.

11:57.271 --> 11:58.505
Used to be.

12:00.591 --> 12:02.926
What can I do for you, Juliette?

12:02.927 --> 12:04.471
Why do you automatically assume

12:04.472 --> 12:06.613
that I need you to do something for me?

12:06.614 --> 12:09.706
Maybe I'm here to offer
to do something for you.

12:09.707 --> 12:12.425
After all, I'm taking your
little contest runner-up

12:12.426 --> 12:13.252
out on the road with me.

12:13.253 --> 12:15.387
Well, I could argue that she's helping you

12:15.388 --> 12:16.639
more than the other way around,

12:16.640 --> 12:18.556
but... sure.

12:19.174 --> 12:23.774
- Tell me what you can do for me.
- Well, Jeff, I've been thinking

12:23.775 --> 12:26.390
that between me and mini-me,

12:26.391 --> 12:28.825
there's a little too
much estrogen on my tour.

12:28.826 --> 12:30.702
So I'd like to round out the show

12:30.703 --> 12:33.362
with a big-hat male act

12:33.363 --> 12:35.205
to help get my audience
a little hot and bothered.

12:35.206 --> 12:38.554
That's actually a good idea.

12:38.555 --> 12:40.437
We're already looking at
artists from other labels

12:40.438 --> 12:41.511
that we can work in.

12:41.512 --> 12:44.463
But if you could see it in your heart to

12:44.464 --> 12:46.607
give me a little extra
money to market my album,

12:46.608 --> 12:47.618
I could see it in my heart

12:47.619 --> 12:50.486
to push an Edgehill artist
at the top of my list.

12:50.487 --> 12:51.654
<i>So there is something in it for you.</i>

12:51.655 --> 12:53.656
My shows are selling out.

12:53.657 --> 12:56.225
This person's gonna get a lot of exposure.

12:56.226 --> 13:00.363
Now it's up to you whether or
not they're from this label.

13:02.218 --> 13:04.249
You might wanna stop poking that bear.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.076
He went after Luke Wheeler
'cause he can't control

13:06.077 --> 13:06.735
his top two artists here,

13:06.736 --> 13:08.102
and he wants to get somebody bigger.

13:08.103 --> 13:09.806
The only thing that I just heard

13:09.807 --> 13:11.640
was I'm one of the top two artists.

13:12.003 --> 13:13.541
Just relax. It's all gonna be fine.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.343
It's coming together.
The tour's doing great.

13:15.344 --> 13:17.759
Well, the band's still not
set. You need a bandleader.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.819
You gotta get somebody out
there you're comfortable with.

13:19.820 --> 13:21.623
-Well, make a list.
-All right.

13:21.624 --> 13:23.751
Hey, how about that Avery
kid? You want him in the band?

13:24.376 --> 13:25.464
No.

13:25.465 --> 13:26.720
I do not need him.

13:33.295 --> 13:37.495
I want to thank you for...
For seeing me today, Teddy.

13:37.496 --> 13:38.331
What do you want, lamar?

13:40.701 --> 13:43.988
I think it's time that
you and I bury the hatchet.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.786
I mean, my granddaughters
are your daughters,

13:45.787 --> 13:47.049
and they deserve to have a family

13:47.050 --> 13:48.430
that isn't warring with itself.

13:48.431 --> 13:50.997
-Is that right?
-I think so.

13:51.521 --> 13:54.557
Now... now my public
affairs man tells me that

13:54.558 --> 13:55.847
you're putting together

13:55.848 --> 13:59.057
a-a citywide music and art festival.

13:59.058 --> 14:03.074
So I'm here today to offer Wyatt Industries

14:03.075 --> 14:04.740
as a corporate sponsor for it.

14:04.741 --> 14:07.664
You are looking for a
backdoor into reestablishing

14:07.665 --> 14:10.173
Wyatt industries'
relationship with the city.

14:10.174 --> 14:11.161
What's the matter, lamar?

14:11.162 --> 14:13.856
Your bottom line take a hit when
you lost your Metro business?

14:15.734 --> 14:19.682
Teddy, I have contracts
with every major city

14:19.683 --> 14:22.544
across the country,
except for my own hometown.

14:22.545 --> 14:24.774
Because you canceled them.

14:24.775 --> 14:27.345
Which you were only able to do

14:27.346 --> 14:30.780
because I financed a campaign
that put you in this office.

14:30.781 --> 14:33.610
When I was sworn in, I
promised to clean up the city.

14:33.611 --> 14:36.214
And everyone knows that any
business with Wyatt Industries

14:36.215 --> 14:37.552
is dirty business.

14:37.553 --> 14:39.565
You're gonna regret this, Teddy.

14:39.942 --> 14:41.191
No.

14:41.192 --> 14:42.290
I don't think I will.

15:03.561 --> 15:04.928
All right, hot shot.

15:06.997 --> 15:09.995
You ready to prove those
rookie mistakes are behind you?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.034
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.606
'Cause I asked Luke
Wheeler to give you a slot

15:12.607 --> 15:13.536
in tonight's show.

15:14.086 --> 15:16.476
Yeah, it's an unofficial
audition to be an opener

15:16.477 --> 15:18.350
on Juliette Barnes' tour.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.668
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Yeah, don't thank me. Thank Brent.

15:23.669 --> 15:25.840
He convinced me you deserve this chance.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.512
Break a leg, Will.

15:28.997 --> 15:31.453
I won't let you down.

15:33.422 --> 15:36.657
So I'm inviting Juliette
into the Opry tonight.

15:36.658 --> 15:37.959
That makes sense.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.794
You two have spent a
lot of time together...

15:39.795 --> 15:41.228
Some of it tolerable.

15:41.229 --> 15:43.998
<i>Well, she just wants to
be you when she grows up.</i>

15:43.999 --> 15:46.500
Well...

15:46.501 --> 15:48.652
I think it's the right thing to do.

15:48.653 --> 15:51.104
Yeah. Might score me some
brownie points with Maddie.

15:51.105 --> 15:53.840
- Who seems to be doing a lot better.
- I think so.

15:53.841 --> 15:55.742
- So...
- Mm.

15:55.743 --> 15:58.211
I am buying myself out of Edgehill.

15:58.212 --> 16:00.080
- For real?
- Yeah.

16:00.674 --> 16:02.478
How did you come up with the capital?

16:02.479 --> 16:05.284
Um... daddy.

16:05.285 --> 16:07.285
- Daddy?
- Mm-hmm.

16:07.823 --> 16:10.307
I mean, I know that you two have been...

16:10.308 --> 16:11.639
Getting along a whole lot better, but...

16:11.640 --> 16:14.003
Listen, I'm not being naive about this.

16:14.004 --> 16:15.792
He's been really trying.

16:15.793 --> 16:19.378
I'm trying to establish some kind of trust.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.568
If I had any more time,

16:21.569 --> 16:23.001
this is not the way I would go.

16:23.002 --> 16:24.435
Yeah.

16:26.171 --> 16:27.298
"I studied poetry

16:27.299 --> 16:29.841
at Ole Miss to help with lyrics."

16:31.209 --> 16:33.044
"I got a job at the Bluebird

16:33.045 --> 16:35.780
so I could watch songwriters
hone their craft."

16:35.781 --> 16:37.281
Any of that stuff true?

16:37.282 --> 16:38.915
In a way.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.018
I just don't wanna say
the wrong thing tonight.

16:42.319 --> 16:44.621
It's always scary at first.

16:44.622 --> 16:46.056
You don't seem scared.

16:46.057 --> 16:48.892
I started singing in pageants when I was 6.

16:48.893 --> 16:52.129
Wow. There's always a
question and answer category.

16:52.527 --> 16:53.729
You always want to be a singer?

16:53.730 --> 16:56.598
Yes, pretty much. Um...

16:56.599 --> 16:59.568
It's why I deferred Harvard
to compete on the show.

16:59.569 --> 17:01.370
Wow.

17:01.371 --> 17:03.527
Do you resent me for
stumbling into a record deal

17:03.528 --> 17:04.406
without wanting one?

17:04.406 --> 17:06.659
I've heard you sing.

17:06.660 --> 17:09.944
- You write beautiful songs.
- That is really nice of you.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.146
Thanks.

17:11.534 --> 17:14.281
The girl who won "American Hitmaker"...

17:14.587 --> 17:16.233
She tried out on a dare.

17:16.233 --> 17:19.094
Fans didn't care she hadn't
been singing her whole life.

17:19.095 --> 17:21.231
They thought she was talented,
so they voted for her,

17:21.232 --> 17:22.510
plain and simple.

17:24.290 --> 17:26.125
- Let me see those.
- Sure.

17:27.494 --> 17:30.931
♪ And it's something
that I never will forget ♪

17:30.932 --> 17:33.214
Don't worry too much about
what the publicist said.

17:33.215 --> 17:35.235
Just be yourself.

17:35.831 --> 17:36.804
Well, he should be here any minute.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.773
So... you and Avery working together.

17:39.774 --> 17:41.741
Yeah.

17:41.742 --> 17:44.711
Kinda surprised myself with that one.

17:44.712 --> 17:46.713
But, you know, we'll see how it goes.

17:46.714 --> 17:49.415
So does Scarlett know you're here?

17:49.416 --> 17:51.383
Not that, uh...

17:51.384 --> 17:53.753
You need to ask her permission or anything.

17:53.754 --> 17:56.298
It's just, um, I... I...

17:56.299 --> 17:57.523
You know what? Forget I asked.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.858
She doesn't.

17:59.859 --> 18:02.794
Look, I know that things
are weird between you two.

18:02.795 --> 18:05.864
And I figured that you'd be
awkward enough to deal with.

18:05.865 --> 18:08.199
I didn't see any reason
to drag her into it.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.036
Mm. So... so this is awkward? Right.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.514
Look, I don't know what
she told you, but...

18:13.515 --> 18:16.240
Hey, I'm Switzerland, okay?

18:16.241 --> 18:18.843
It takes two people to end a relationship.

18:18.844 --> 18:20.410
You and I are cool.

18:20.411 --> 18:21.678
Hello, hello!

18:21.679 --> 18:23.680
- Hey!
- Hey.

18:23.681 --> 18:25.182
It's, uh, not bad.

18:25.183 --> 18:26.784
I like what you've done with the place.

18:26.785 --> 18:28.853
So you guys ready to get started?

18:28.854 --> 18:30.053
Yeah, you bet.

18:33.657 --> 18:34.958
Looky here.

18:34.959 --> 18:38.128
Hey. I hope you don't mind me stopping by.

18:38.129 --> 18:39.996
Are you kidding me?

18:39.997 --> 18:41.030
How are you doin'?

18:41.629 --> 18:43.767
I'm good.

18:43.768 --> 18:45.102
Looks great in here.

18:45.103 --> 18:46.898
Looks like Scarlett's been
taking good care of you.

18:46.899 --> 18:49.371
Yeah. You here to check up on me?

18:49.372 --> 18:52.241
Uh... maybe.

18:52.242 --> 18:54.376
Well...

18:54.377 --> 18:56.378
I'm doin' pretty good.

18:56.379 --> 19:00.149
Going to meetings, you know,
and a lot of physical therapy.

19:00.150 --> 19:01.983
Oh, that doctor you sent me to...

19:01.984 --> 19:05.186
- She's great.
- Good.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.189
Well, on that note, is there any chance

19:08.190 --> 19:10.424
you would consider coming
back out on the road with me?

19:12.154 --> 19:13.194
I said the doctor's great.

19:13.195 --> 19:16.230
The hand? Not so much.

19:16.231 --> 19:18.364
Which reminds me, I'm glad you came over.

19:18.365 --> 19:22.235
There's something I've been
meaning to give back to you.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.304
- Whoa, the Martin?
- Yeah.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.507
A guitar like this deserves to be played.

19:27.508 --> 19:29.542
All right? And I'm just not in a position

19:29.543 --> 19:31.577
to do that right now.
We'll just say it's a loan,

19:31.578 --> 19:34.146
till things change, if they change.

19:34.147 --> 19:35.281
What if I come up with a position

19:35.282 --> 19:36.916
where you don't have to play?

19:37.699 --> 19:39.685
Just come out on the road
with me for a few days.

19:39.686 --> 19:41.253
- I'm still retooling things.
- I appreciate it, I do.

19:41.254 --> 19:42.754
You can be the music director.

19:42.755 --> 19:43.923
I can't.

19:45.992 --> 19:47.193
Steppin' away.

19:47.194 --> 19:48.360
From what?

19:50.696 --> 19:52.363
All of it.

19:53.833 --> 19:54.833
It just hurts too much being around music

19:54.834 --> 19:56.134
if I can't play it.

19:57.633 --> 20:02.340
Yeah. It's a shame. Damn
accident ruined two great careers.

20:02.341 --> 20:04.242
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What... what did you say?

20:05.885 --> 20:08.045
You haven't heard the
rumors about Rayna's voice?

20:08.467 --> 20:09.812
What about Rayna's voice?

20:11.080 --> 20:12.715
Juliette, what?

20:12.716 --> 20:15.952
They're saying... That she can't sing.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.321
I don't know that for sure.

20:18.322 --> 20:20.823
I just know that

20:20.824 --> 20:23.359
she's passing every opportunity she's had.

- I told you I wouldn't let you down.
- I know. I know. You did.

21:57.255 --> 21:59.256
- Yes!
- Congrats.

22:01.279 --> 22:02.685
I guess I did need your help.

22:02.686 --> 22:03.760

- Nice.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.507
That was fun, you guys.

23:32.511 --> 23:34.144
Layla, can you tell us
how you're getting ready

23:34.145 --> 23:35.913
for your first arena tour?

23:35.914 --> 23:38.114
Eight glasses of water a
day and plenty of sleep.

23:38.115 --> 23:39.483
Right here.

23:42.019 --> 23:43.687
Jamie, this is, uh, Scarlett o'Connor.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.054
She is the first artist

23:45.055 --> 23:46.890
on Rayna Jaymes' Highway 65 label.

23:46.891 --> 23:48.692
That must be really exciting for you.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.361
Um, did you grow up singing her songs?

23:51.362 --> 23:52.795
I was too shy to sing. I
only ever sang in church,

23:52.796 --> 23:54.930
but I did get to meet her one
time when I was really small

23:54.931 --> 23:56.365
'cause of my uncle.

23:56.366 --> 23:58.233
- Who's your Uncle?
- Deacon Claybourne.

23:58.234 --> 23:59.902
Fascinating.

23:59.903 --> 24:01.804
So do you know why he was drinking

24:01.805 --> 24:03.906
- the night of their accident?
- No.

24:03.907 --> 24:06.141
I... don't... That seems...

24:07.744 --> 24:10.144
That's kind of a personal matter, isn't it?

24:11.781 --> 24:15.517
Um, the first time I ever
sang was at the Bluebird cafe.

24:15.518 --> 24:17.051
Practically had to drag me up on stage

24:17.052 --> 24:19.020
at an open mic night
to get noise out of me.

24:19.021 --> 24:21.389
But I... I did it. Um...

24:21.390 --> 24:22.624
Jamie... Jamie, I-I'm,
uh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.091
We should keep it moving.

24:24.092 --> 24:25.659
Come on. What the hell was that? Huh?

24:25.660 --> 24:28.796
When you go off-book, you lose
control of the conversation.

24:28.797 --> 24:31.799
<i>When you look like a
fool, I look like a fool.</i>

24:31.800 --> 24:32.866
I will just watch the show.

24:32.867 --> 24:34.301
I won't talk to anybody anymore.

24:34.302 --> 24:36.637
No. No, honey, that's worse.
You'll come off as aloof.

24:36.638 --> 24:37.938
There's more than just press here.

24:37.939 --> 24:39.272
There are programmers, promoters,

24:39.273 --> 24:41.140
a lot of people who
want to get to know you.

24:41.141 --> 24:43.576
And if you just ignore all of them,

24:43.577 --> 24:45.344
your career is over before it starts.

24:45.345 --> 24:49.148
You either stay on
script, or you can go home.

24:49.149 --> 24:50.416
The choice is yours.

24:50.417 --> 24:53.018
I really just want to be myself.

24:53.019 --> 24:55.254
Get her out of here.

25:02.194 --> 25:04.362
All right, Buck, I'll see you there.

25:09.824 --> 25:11.570
Hey.

25:12.237 --> 25:13.603
I'm sorry. I let myself in.

25:13.604 --> 25:16.273
Are... the girls here? I can leave.

25:16.274 --> 25:17.740
No, they're not here.

25:17.741 --> 25:20.009
What's going on?

25:20.010 --> 25:21.945
Why didn't you tell me?

25:23.312 --> 25:24.748
Tell you what?

25:24.749 --> 25:26.717
That you can't sing.

25:26.718 --> 25:28.718
Who'd you hear that from?

25:28.719 --> 25:31.253
- Well, is it true?
- I'm working with a vocal therapist.

25:31.254 --> 25:34.357
It's taking some time.
Yeah, but can you sing?

25:34.358 --> 25:35.859
Well, we're working on it.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.094
Working...

25:38.095 --> 25:39.996
Can you sing, Rayna?

25:39.997 --> 25:41.230
- I said we're working on it.
- Can you sing?

25:41.231 --> 25:42.264
- I don't know. I don't know!
- Can you sing?!

25:43.132 --> 25:44.232
I don't know.

25:45.446 --> 25:46.567
I'm not quite sure

25:46.568 --> 25:48.736
what's gonna come out of
my mouth when I open it.

25:53.476 --> 25:55.544
Everything's different now.

25:55.545 --> 25:58.346
Yeah.

25:58.347 --> 26:01.015
How's your hand?

26:05.053 --> 26:06.921
I'm done.

26:06.922 --> 26:10.024
Not gonna be anybody's
guitarist anytime soon.

26:10.025 --> 26:13.293
You don't need to be
anybody's guitar player.

26:14.996 --> 26:16.763
You might need to take a minute,

26:16.764 --> 26:18.899
figure out who you are
without a guitar in your hand.

26:22.036 --> 26:25.304
But don't you ever say
you're done with music.

26:25.305 --> 26:27.774
You either, okay?

26:34.420 --> 26:37.322
♪ Yeah, hey, hey

26:37.323 --> 26:38.729

tonight to help us raise money

26:40.392 --> 26:42.060
for the W.O. Smith music school.

26:42.061 --> 26:43.394

<i>Incredible. You're even

26:55.640 --> 26:57.074

I guess I worked my
nerves out in rehearsal.

26:59.310 --> 27:01.377
I'll get 'em back when I'm
on the tour bus, though.

27:01.378 --> 27:02.779
That's okay.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.213
I haven't had the chance
to tell you how excited I am

27:04.214 --> 27:06.248
that you're coming on tour with us.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.250
- Oh, you two are already friends, huh?
- Yeah.

27:08.251 --> 27:09.894
Good, that'll make it
easier when I tell you

27:09.895 --> 27:13.022
to cut 15 minutes from your
set to make room for Will.

27:13.023 --> 27:15.057

27:15.058 --> 27:16.592

27:16.593 --> 27:18.426
Is it just me, or did
she seem to enjoy that

27:18.427 --> 27:19.761
a little bit too much?

27:19.762 --> 27:21.663
Kinda like you with
Scarlett on the press line?

27:21.664 --> 27:23.632
What are you talking about?

27:23.633 --> 27:25.734
Well, you play innocent all you want.

27:25.735 --> 27:27.970
I know you did something to mess with her.

27:43.619 --> 27:44.819
That's gotta be one

27:44.820 --> 27:47.054
of the stupidest experiences of my life.

27:47.055 --> 27:48.455
You'd think having a music contract

27:48.456 --> 27:49.956
would be about music,

27:49.957 --> 27:52.125
but no, it's about the
color lip gloss you wear

27:52.126 --> 27:53.527

can tell in front of...

because you drank that
part of your brain away...

you suddenly got weird?

29:18.841 --> 29:22.476
- Great job, Juliette. Great job.
- Thank you. Thank you.

29:22.477 --> 29:23.978
Now hold on. Before you run off,

29:23.979 --> 29:27.047
there's somebody here
who needs to talk to you.

29:27.048 --> 29:29.516
Right there.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.486
Thank you!

29:33.487 --> 29:35.459
Hey, Luke, thanks for letting me

29:35.460 --> 29:38.125
crash your party here.
How you doin', Juliette?

29:38.126 --> 29:40.893
I'm... good. I'm good.

29:40.894 --> 29:42.862
Oh, well, you're more than just good.

29:42.863 --> 29:44.096
Don't y'all think?

29:46.300 --> 29:48.767
Well, you know, I've been
real fortunate this year,

29:48.768 --> 29:50.369
'cause I've been able
to spend a lot of time

29:50.370 --> 29:52.004
with Juliette. We wrote a song together.

29:52.005 --> 29:53.906
We've been out on tour together.

29:53.907 --> 29:56.742
And, uh, you're startin'
to feel like family to me.

29:56.743 --> 29:58.076
And you know what?

29:58.077 --> 30:00.212
There's another big ol' family out there

30:00.213 --> 30:03.581
that would just love to
embrace you with open arms,

30:03.582 --> 30:05.250
if you'll have us, of course.

30:05.251 --> 30:06.818
Juliette Barnes, would you like to be

30:06.819 --> 30:09.487
the newest member of the Grand Ole Opry?

30:14.558 --> 30:17.527
Congratulations.

30:20.198 --> 30:22.266
Wow! Um...

30:22.267 --> 30:24.869
Thank you.

30:24.870 --> 30:27.637
You know, somebody said to me

30:27.638 --> 30:31.241
yesterday that I was on a roll, and...

30:31.242 --> 30:33.809
Gosh, maybe I am, but this...

30:33.810 --> 30:38.248
To be invited to join such hallowed company

30:38.249 --> 30:39.582
is just...

30:39.583 --> 30:42.252
It's the highest honor.

30:42.253 --> 30:44.087
Thank you.

30:47.156 --> 30:49.224
Congratulations.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.264
Now... now hang on a sec there, Rayna.

30:55.265 --> 30:57.665
Uh, first off, uh, I think we should all

30:57.666 --> 30:59.467
let Rayna know how happy we are

30:59.468 --> 31:01.668
about, uh, her pulling
through after that accident,

31:01.669 --> 31:02.937
and that she's here and healthy.

31:02.938 --> 31:04.638
Come on. Let her hear ya.

31:04.639 --> 31:05.839
Congratulations.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.341
Oh, thank you.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.678
We look forward to seeing
you at the Opry a lot.

31:10.679 --> 31:12.646
Are you kiddin' me? When I'm not on tour,

31:12.647 --> 31:14.689
you are gonna have to yank me
off that stage with a giant hook.

31:14.690 --> 31:16.617
Now, Rayna, I know you're
not on the bill tonight,

31:16.618 --> 31:18.518
but we have all missed your voice.

31:18.519 --> 31:20.153
And, uh, if you would just

31:20.154 --> 31:22.555
sing a little somethin' for us right now,

31:22.556 --> 31:26.526
I'm sure the folks at home
would be more than generous

31:26.527 --> 31:29.162
with their donations.

31:29.163 --> 31:30.630
Y'all are so sweet.

31:30.631 --> 31:32.832
Well, I don't have anything
rehearsed, so unfortunately,

31:32.833 --> 31:34.666
I don't think we're gonna be
able to do it tonight, but...

31:34.667 --> 31:36.335
No, that's okay. Do...
Do one of the old ones.

31:36.336 --> 31:37.636
I'm sure the band knows them all by heart.

31:37.637 --> 31:39.771
Come on. What do you
say? You wanna hear it?

31:39.772 --> 31:41.340
All right. Come on, now.

31:41.341 --> 31:42.841
Come on, guys. Let's play "Best Songs."

33:47.459 --> 33:49.092
- What's the meaning of this?
- You have the right to remain silent.

Anything you say can be
used against you in court.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.833
for you to really engage with the fans.

35:01.834 --> 35:04.436
And since they're already
invested in "LaylaAndWill",

35:04.437 --> 35:05.804
let's give it to 'em.

35:05.805 --> 35:08.540

But why pass up the chance to
deflect some of her shine onto you?

35:15.447 --> 35:18.215
I'll start tweeting
about it myself right now.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.850
Good, good. Good job.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.289
Aah!

35:26.290 --> 35:28.459
- Big night for you.
- Did you know?

35:28.460 --> 35:31.026
- Uh...
- Did you?

35:31.027 --> 35:33.429
Did you also know that Rayna could sing?

35:33.430 --> 35:35.631
I mean, I'm happy for her,

35:35.632 --> 35:37.900
but her timing just killed my moment.

35:37.901 --> 35:40.636
Mm. Well, I don't think
she did it on purpose.

35:40.637 --> 35:42.505
I know.

35:42.506 --> 35:43.359
Well, it's good to meet y'all.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.507
- Take care. Thank you.
- Rayna, hey!

35:44.508 --> 35:46.641
Hey! There he is.

35:46.642 --> 35:48.009
I just have to thank you
for what you did tonight.

35:48.010 --> 35:49.419
Oh, my gosh.

35:49.420 --> 35:50.779
- I had such a good time.
- Oh, good.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.414
What a great event.

35:52.415 --> 35:54.616
- Your kids like music?
- It's their second favorite hobby

35:54.617 --> 35:56.918
after getting my goat.

35:56.919 --> 35:58.653
Yeah, why don't they tell
you about the terrible tweens?

35:58.654 --> 36:00.221
Yeah, well, what I meant was...

36:00.222 --> 36:01.522
Truth be told, I wasn't thrilled

36:01.523 --> 36:03.156
when tonight was hijacked to invite

36:03.157 --> 36:05.793
some little flash in
the pan to join the Opry,

36:05.794 --> 36:07.695
but since it led to you singing,

36:07.696 --> 36:09.029
- I'm kinda over it.
- I'll see you soon.

36:09.030 --> 36:11.499
All right.

36:13.535 --> 36:17.204
- Jeff, you got a minute?
- We'll talk about it later.

36:17.205 --> 36:18.671
Hey, nice performance tonight.

36:18.672 --> 36:19.906
Thank you.

36:19.907 --> 36:22.475
So you can stop spreading
rumors about my voice.

36:22.476 --> 36:25.445
And while you're at it,
stop threatening my album.

36:25.446 --> 36:27.680
Look, I want you and
Liam back in the studio.

36:27.681 --> 36:29.916
Okay? A.S.A.P. We gotta finish that album,

36:29.917 --> 36:31.518
and launch it as your comeback

36:31.519 --> 36:33.452
- before the heat from this is gone.
- Is that what you want?

36:33.453 --> 36:34.953
I'm not doing a comeback album.

36:36.289 --> 36:39.425
All due respect, um, I
will handle the marketing.

36:39.426 --> 36:40.926
Okay, and you... You handle the singing.

36:40.927 --> 36:42.227
We are a team.

36:42.228 --> 36:43.328
We're gonna make this album multiplatinum.

36:43.329 --> 36:44.830
We're not a team.

36:44.831 --> 36:46.131
And I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want

36:46.132 --> 36:47.966
<i>with my album and with my artists.</i>

36:47.967 --> 36:50.167
- I heard what you did with Scarlett tonight.
- Oh, okay.

36:50.168 --> 36:52.804
No, I-I did you a favor.
She was embarrassing you.

36:52.805 --> 36:54.171
And by the way, that album is not yours.

36:54.172 --> 36:55.807
That album is Edgehill's.

36:55.808 --> 36:58.075
And Highway 65... That is just

36:58.076 --> 37:00.578
a-a vanity project.
It's a little opportunity

37:00.579 --> 37:02.012
for you to put your stamp of approval

37:02.013 --> 37:03.380
on artists that you believe in,

37:03.381 --> 37:06.015
so that I can use your name
to help them get exposure.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.684
I'm just done. I'm done.

37:07.685 --> 37:09.519
I'm done with you, Jeff.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.220
And I'm done with Edgehill.

37:11.221 --> 37:13.289
You'll get my buyout paperwork next week.

37:15.860 --> 37:19.262
- Hey.
- Hey, um, you can't go out that way.

37:19.263 --> 37:20.597
The press is swarming out there.

37:20.598 --> 37:22.230
Oh. Well, I can handle that.

37:22.231 --> 37:23.699
You know, I think it's
been a pretty good night.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.168
It's not for you. Your...

40:27.372 --> 40:28.606
I get it now.

40:28.607 --> 40:30.642
Get what?

40:30.643 --> 40:32.744
Why you were that pissed off at me

40:32.745 --> 40:34.978
at the Wentworths' anniversary party.

40:34.979 --> 40:37.714
It really sucks when you
think someone's got your back,

40:37.715 --> 40:39.516
and they don't.

40:39.517 --> 40:42.653
Is that an apology?

40:42.654 --> 40:46.623
I got invited to join the Opry tonight.

40:46.624 --> 40:49.359
And you know what the first
thing that came to my mind was?

40:49.360 --> 40:52.828
<i>"I can't wait to tell Avery."</i>

40:52.829 --> 40:54.764
And then I realized it was my fault

40:54.765 --> 40:56.231
that we're not talkin'.

40:56.232 --> 40:59.769
So, yes. I'm sorry.

40:59.770 --> 41:01.937
Thank you.

41:01.938 --> 41:05.041
You ready to come back out on the road...

41:05.042 --> 41:08.009
Play some guitar? I could use a friend.

41:09.311 --> 41:11.813
I can't.

41:11.814 --> 41:14.683
Look, I apologized once.
I'm not gonna do it twice.

41:14.684 --> 41:15.884
I know.

41:15.885 --> 41:18.186
It's just not the job for me.

41:18.187 --> 41:21.156
What, and hauling beer and ice is?

41:21.157 --> 41:22.222
Well, at least I get
to work on my own stuff

41:22.223 --> 41:24.058
during the day.

41:24.059 --> 41:27.061
You're killing me. Okay.

41:28.329 --> 41:32.199
Well, if you're gonna
stay here, then, uh...

41:32.200 --> 41:34.267
Use my studio.

41:34.268 --> 41:36.536
State-of-the-art,
anytime you want.

41:41.141 --> 41:42.942
Wow. Thank you.

41:42.943 --> 41:45.611
You're welcome.

41:59.425 --> 42:02.961
- Daddy...
- Just save your breath, I know...

42:02.962 --> 42:04.629
It was Teddy.

42:07.499 --> 42:08.900
I put the feds on to his embezzlement

42:08.901 --> 42:10.768
back when he was threatening to sue

42:10.769 --> 42:12.803
for full custody of the girls, remember?

42:12.804 --> 42:14.271
Yeah.

42:14.272 --> 42:16.406
I was just trying to protect
your sister, that's all.

42:16.407 --> 42:19.543
Now that he's become the mayor...

42:19.544 --> 42:23.280
He has access to all sorts
of the inside information

42:23.281 --> 42:25.949
about Wyatt Industries'
contracts with the city.

42:25.950 --> 42:29.018
Do you think he cut a deal
to try to save himself?

42:29.019 --> 42:30.620
Oh, I'm certain of it,

42:30.621 --> 42:33.522
just as certain as I am...

42:35.860 --> 42:37.794
Teddy's gonna pay for this.
