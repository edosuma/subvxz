00:05.503 --> 00:07.165
<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:07.590 --> 00:10.695
<i>You're not the first program
Tron trained to fight back...</i>

00:11.030 --> 00:12.498
I am.

00:12.533 --> 00:17.374
<i>Beck discovers that with Tron,
honesty is in short supply...</i>

00:17.408 --> 00:20.346
- Was I your first choice?
- Yes.

00:20.381 --> 00:24.388
<i>While Beck continues to supply his
friends with truths of his own...</i>

00:24.422 --> 00:26.591
- Cover my shift?
- Why can't you do your shift?

00:26.625 --> 00:28.662
Just... don't feel like working.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.333
How did you become the Renegade?

00:32.403 --> 00:34.806
<i>It's okay, Beck. I know.</i>

00:49.768 --> 00:51.503
<i>Let's just ask up here.</i>

00:51.538 --> 00:54.543
<i>- Excuse me, sir, do you know...
- Keep moving.</i>

00:54.577 --> 00:58.850
There must be some mistake! I would
never hide energy from General Tesler.

00:58.885 --> 01:01.389
Last chance, citizen!

01:01.423 --> 01:03.525
Tell us where the energy is!

01:04.696 --> 01:05.976
<i>Halt! You are in violation of...</i>

01:14.380 --> 01:15.515
Stand down.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.737
Thank you. You saved our lives.

01:27.772 --> 01:32.479
You want to thank me?
Show me the energy you're hiding.

01:32.514 --> 01:35.786
Come on.
I'm on your side. Remember?

01:41.464 --> 01:44.702
Well, I... I guess we're both fighting
the occupation in our own way.

01:44.736 --> 01:47.574
True... except I work alone.

01:57.694 --> 02:00.498
No! Don't hurt me! Please!

02:03.805 --> 02:06.442
Tell them what I did.

02:12.822 --> 02:15.558
Guess who's back.

02:22.014 --> 02:31.514
<b>S01E18 - No Bounds</b>

02:40.765 --> 02:42.634
<i>You're lucky you're alive.</i>

02:42.669 --> 02:45.957
I know.
It's not even safe to deliver

02:45.958 --> 02:48.512
a light cycle anymore
without body armor.

02:48.546 --> 02:51.584
Anybody know why the shop exploded?

02:51.618 --> 02:52.787
<i>Tron did it.</i>

02:52.821 --> 02:53.821
What?

02:53.856 --> 02:58.531
I know. It made
no sense to me either, but...

02:58.565 --> 03:01.536
there was a girl here,
the shop's sole survivor,

03:01.570 --> 03:03.607
she showed everybody her disc,

03:03.641 --> 03:08.382
and there he was, terrorizing
her, white suit and all.

03:08.416 --> 03:10.452
Maybe he finally flipped out.

03:10.486 --> 03:13.391
Fighting an entire occupation
by yourself can't be easy.

03:13.425 --> 03:17.532
- Tron's not a killer.
- Well, something's changed,

03:17.566 --> 03:21.506
because according to what I saw,
he was enjoying it.

03:23.778 --> 03:26.582
<i>Hold still. This is gonna sting.</i>

03:27.852 --> 03:32.393
Whoa!
That's a big... piece of...

03:32.427 --> 03:33.829
Zed!

03:33.864 --> 03:37.402
Zed, come on, buddy. Wake up.

03:37.436 --> 03:42.377
- Is he okay?
- What... what happened?

03:42.412 --> 03:45.450
No worries. Everything's fine.

03:53.666 --> 03:54.701
<i>Ouch.</i>

04:03.818 --> 04:06.322
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

04:21.718 --> 04:23.487
That wasn't my fault!

04:23.521 --> 04:25.625
<i>I know, I know. I'm fine.</i>

04:33.473 --> 04:35.843
Show yourself!
I'm done playing games.

04:38.716 --> 04:41.654
<i>That's too bad, Renegade...</i>

04:41.689 --> 04:44.459
<i>Because I'm just getting warmed up.</i>

05:04.931 --> 05:08.671
<i>You're just as persistent as I remember.</i>

05:08.705 --> 05:11.777
I liked you better when
I thought you were dead.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.515
Did you lose something?

05:30.478 --> 05:31.814
This can't be happening.

05:35.754 --> 05:37.758
Right where I left it.

05:39.762 --> 05:42.467
- But why would he want me to...
- Beck?

05:42.801 --> 05:45.839
- Everything okay?
- I-I'm good.

05:47.610 --> 05:50.581
You want to stick with that answer?

05:50.615 --> 05:52.585
I do.

05:54.590 --> 05:57.695
<i>Threat level is now red.</i>

05:57.729 --> 06:02.370
<i>The Renegade is wanted for the
unlawful killing of civilian program.</i>

06:02.405 --> 06:05.442
<i>Do not approach.
Extremely dangerous.</i>

06:22.674 --> 06:25.713
<i>Scanning complete.
Virus contained.</i>

06:25.747 --> 06:28.385
You lied to me.
You knew he was out there,

06:28.419 --> 06:30.355
and you never told me.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.594
No. It seems you
knew he was out there.

06:33.629 --> 06:35.732
As far as I was concerned,
he was locked away.

06:35.766 --> 06:37.768
Don't twist this back on me!

06:37.802 --> 06:40.474
I deserve the truth, and
you're gonna give it to me!

06:40.508 --> 06:43.312
Truth is, Cyrus was a mistake.

06:43.346 --> 06:45.316
He was never worthy
of my name or the suit.

06:45.350 --> 06:49.791
All that mattered to him was bringing
about the end of everything we know.

06:51.728 --> 06:54.533
Which is why I chose you instead.

06:54.568 --> 06:56.670
You fight for the
things you care about...

06:56.704 --> 06:59.576
things like your city,
and your friends.

06:59.610 --> 07:02.581
That's right. But now your lying
has put them all in jeopardy.

07:02.615 --> 07:05.453
I stand behind my decision.

07:05.487 --> 07:09.461
I did what I knew was best...
for you, and for the revolution.

07:09.495 --> 07:12.766
Then I'm done. It's obvious we're
not on the same page anymore.

07:12.801 --> 07:15.639
<i>You can't run away from this, Beck!</i>

07:15.673 --> 07:18.777
<i>Quitting is exactly what
Cyrus wants you to do!</i>

07:18.812 --> 07:21.416
<i>You don't know that.</i>

07:21.451 --> 07:24.689
Good-bye, Tron. I have to protect
my friends from your mistake.

07:32.137 --> 07:34.445
- Beck!
- Mara.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.512
- You're finally here.
- Where's Zed?

07:37.546 --> 07:39.716
Let's go somewhere else.
I need to clear my head.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.554
Then it's true... you quit.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.825
W-what are you talking about?

07:44.860 --> 07:47.531
Sorry, but your secret's out.

07:47.565 --> 07:50.608
Your friend already told
us everything.

07:50.693 --> 07:53.542
Beck! Now we know where
you spend all your time.

07:53.576 --> 07:56.881
I'd skip out of work too if it
meant hanging out with this guy.

07:58.752 --> 08:01.691
Glad you made it, buddy.

08:01.725 --> 08:03.460
Come join us.

08:03.494 --> 08:06.566
I was just about to tell
our friends how we met.

08:15.358 --> 08:16.627
Enjoy, everyone.

08:17.897 --> 08:21.136
- Thanks, but I'm not thirsty.
- What's the matter?

08:21.170 --> 08:23.974
You and the boss not
seeing eye-to-eye?

08:24.008 --> 08:27.413
Actually, he said he'd never
trained anyone as good as me.

08:28.984 --> 08:33.158
I'm confused. Did you quit your
job at the garage or not, Beck?

08:33.192 --> 08:36.931
Of course not. Whoever
told you that is a lunatic.

08:36.965 --> 08:38.967
We should lock him up
and throw away the key.

08:39.001 --> 08:42.073
Ouch. One. Zero.

08:42.107 --> 08:43.342
Don't take that from him!

08:43.376 --> 08:48.118
It's "Cyrus."
Why so combative, pal?

08:48.152 --> 08:50.289
Are you feeling misunderstood?

08:50.323 --> 08:53.028
Like nobody knows the real you?

08:53.062 --> 08:59.072
Tell me, because I'm here to help you.
Just like you did me.

08:59.106 --> 09:03.948
I don't have a clue what
you're talking about... Cy.

09:05.151 --> 09:07.053
Come on! Get to the good stuff!

09:07.087 --> 09:10.092
- Tell us how you guys met.
- Yeah, tell us.

09:10.126 --> 09:14.132
Of course.
What do you say, Beck?

09:14.167 --> 09:16.937
Do you want to tell them, or should I?

09:16.972 --> 09:21.012
Oh!
This is it! I love this song!

09:21.046 --> 09:22.949
Zed, come on. Dance with me.

09:22.984 --> 09:25.988
- What?! But I want to hear...
- It can wait.

09:26.022 --> 09:28.994
Promise us no juicy Beck
stories until we get back.

09:29.028 --> 09:30.263
Are there any other kind, darling?

09:30.297 --> 09:33.369
Seriously? I love this guy.

09:35.306 --> 09:38.043
- Give me back my disc.
- Gladly.

09:44.290 --> 09:47.227
Hold on. I thought you quit.

09:47.261 --> 09:51.168
- Let go.
- Make me.

09:54.242 --> 09:56.344
What's the matter, Renegade?

09:56.378 --> 09:58.983
Come on, punch me. Head-butt me.

09:59.017 --> 10:00.252
Bring it!

10:02.189 --> 10:05.061
<i>Oh, how stupid of me.</i>

10:05.095 --> 10:07.464
You won't fight because your
precious friends are here.

10:07.498 --> 10:11.205
To tell you the truth, that
Zed rubs me the wrong way.

10:11.239 --> 10:15.413
Now Mara, on the other hand...
she grows on you.

10:15.448 --> 10:19.019
I like her... a lot.

10:19.053 --> 10:22.325
- Stay away from them.
- Or what?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.463
That's your problem...

10:24.498 --> 10:28.103
you don't derez programs, do you?

10:28.137 --> 10:31.109
But like I said,
I'm gonna help you out.

10:31.143 --> 10:35.082
I'm gonna free you from
your indecisive thinking.

10:35.117 --> 10:38.154
- I'm done listening.
- Well, then take action.

10:38.188 --> 10:41.328
I have it from a good source
that Argon's new Renegade

10:41.362 --> 10:44.132
has planted
a bomb in Able's garage.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.437
Get there in time, you can disarm it.

10:46.471 --> 10:51.112
Get there too late, and, well...
you know the drill.

10:51.147 --> 10:53.550
You forget...
I visited your special prison.

10:53.584 --> 10:58.125
- I know your tricks.
- Beck, comrade,

10:58.160 --> 11:00.128
from one Renegade to another...

11:00.163 --> 11:03.435
sometimes a bomb is just a bomb.

11:23.106 --> 11:24.307
<i>I need everyone to get out!</i>

11:24.341 --> 11:26.344
<i>This is an emergency! Go!!!</i>

11:26.378 --> 11:28.481
- Beck, what's going on?
- There's a bomb.

11:28.515 --> 11:30.284
In my garage?

11:32.423 --> 11:34.225
Oh, no. Get down!

11:52.360 --> 11:56.432
- Cyrus is a creature of habit.
- Wait. You know him?

11:56.467 --> 12:00.273
Who do you
think built his prison?

12:00.307 --> 12:04.147
If we dig deep enough, we'll
find that all of his explosives

12:04.182 --> 12:06.384
are repurposed from
materials available to him.

12:06.418 --> 12:09.223
Ya know, you should have
told me what happened.

12:09.257 --> 12:11.259
I didn't want to drag you into this.

12:11.294 --> 12:15.067
- So you lied.
- But for a good reason.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.438
- Just like Tron lied to you.
- No, it was...

12:17.472 --> 12:20.343
For exactly the same reason.

12:20.377 --> 12:23.149
He was protecting you,

12:23.183 --> 12:26.154
just like you thought
you were protecting me.

12:26.188 --> 12:29.360
Yeah, well, it seemed different
at the time. Which is why I quit.

12:29.394 --> 12:32.165
Quit? You can't quit.

12:32.199 --> 12:34.169
But I can't trust him.
Cyrus said...

12:34.203 --> 12:36.240
Cyrus?!

12:36.274 --> 12:40.146
Don't you know you can't believe
anything that program says?

12:40.181 --> 12:42.284
It's how he beats you!

12:42.318 --> 12:46.091
He tricks you into doing one thing,
when it's really about another!

12:46.125 --> 12:47.526
Just like your bike here...

12:47.561 --> 12:50.499
Cyrus never even had to lift a finger.

12:50.533 --> 12:53.472
He let you hand-deliver
the bomb straight to his target!

12:53.506 --> 12:57.144
He could have sent you anywhere!

12:57.178 --> 12:59.149
The counterfeit disc.

13:04.359 --> 13:08.132
<i>Containment breach.
Unable to neutralize.</i>

13:08.166 --> 13:10.469
<i>All power systems shutting down.</i>

13:18.251 --> 13:20.488
What, no hug?

13:37.251 --> 13:40.125
<i>I-I-I knew you'd come.</i>

13:40.159 --> 13:41.326
<i>I-I-I-</i>

13:41.361 --> 13:44.331
<i>I knew you...
I-I-I knew you'd...</i>

13:46.537 --> 13:50.443
<i>So, let the games begin.</i>

13:50.478 --> 13:52.414
I'm not here to play games.

13:52.448 --> 13:56.588
<i>It's the
only reason you're here.</i>

13:56.622 --> 14:00.496
<i>How sad. Even my prerecorded
hologram finds you predictable.</i>

14:00.530 --> 14:02.432
<i>But enough about me.</i>

14:02.466 --> 14:07.141
<i>My beloved mentor Tron
believes in a free Grid.</i>

14:07.175 --> 14:08.543
<i>But that's a lie.</i>

14:08.577 --> 14:13.185
<i>All programs are just that:
Programmed.</i>

14:13.219 --> 14:16.324
<i>No one on the Grid
chooses their destiny.</i>

14:16.359 --> 14:19.396
<i>Until now.</i>

14:19.431 --> 14:24.105
<i>Today your future is up to you.</i>

14:24.139 --> 14:29.348
<i>Mechanic or Renegade...
who will you be?</i>

14:29.383 --> 14:33.322
<i>I have left you a single code
key that can disable them,</i>

14:33.356 --> 14:36.361
<i>but you can't be
in two places at once.</i>

14:36.396 --> 14:38.739
Here. Make sure
Zed and Mara are safe.

14:38.740 --> 14:43.208
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll think of something.

14:43.242 --> 14:46.514
<i>On one end of the
city over Argon square,</i>

14:46.548 --> 14:51.422
<i>Tron is waiting for you in a
compressor room with a bomb on his back.</i>

14:51.456 --> 14:56.197
<i>While far away, your friends are
locked in a crane high over the docks</i>

14:56.232 --> 14:59.237
<i>in the same explosive predicament.</i>

15:00.540 --> 15:04.547
<i>No matter what you do,
someone will not survive.</i>

15:04.581 --> 15:08.487
<i>So with time running
out, I have to ask...</i>

15:08.522 --> 15:11.392
<i>who will you save?</i>

15:31.415 --> 15:34.119
- Able!
- Help us!

15:36.225 --> 15:38.428
- Tron.
- Quickly! Get it off of me,

15:38.462 --> 15:42.268
- and we can still rescue your friends.
- It's already taken care of.

15:42.302 --> 15:45.139
Able's on his way now get
them with the code key.

15:46.509 --> 15:49.314
Come on.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.253
What... what's the
matter, Able?!

15:52.287 --> 15:54.190
Yeah, get them off of us!

15:54.224 --> 15:57.262
I should have known it.
The key's no good!

15:57.296 --> 16:00.134
- It was a trick.
- A trick? Whose trick?

16:00.168 --> 16:01.436
Will you please stop jabbering?

16:01.471 --> 16:03.306
I can barely think straight.

16:03.340 --> 16:07.114
- There we go. Bypassed.
- Excellent work, Beck.

16:07.148 --> 16:09.151
Don't thank me... thank Bodhi.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.489
<i>Going somewhere?</i>

16:11.523 --> 16:16.464
<i>You pick him over your
friends... how predictable.</i>

16:16.499 --> 16:20.271
If my friends are hurt,
I will derez you with my bare...

16:20.306 --> 16:23.511
<i>Finally! Some fire! Some vigor!</i>

16:27.319 --> 16:31.426
Your friends aren't hurt,
you idiot. They're dead.

16:40.577 --> 16:45.418
You killed them when you
decided to rescue Tron instead.

16:45.453 --> 16:48.357
Wait. Where's the code key?

16:50.228 --> 16:52.465
<i>This is spectacular!</i>

16:52.499 --> 16:56.338
<i>You've sent someone else
to retrieve your friends.</i>

16:56.373 --> 16:59.377
Admit it...
he's beaten you, Cyrus.

16:59.411 --> 17:02.216
Wrong! You don't have
a clue what he's done!

17:02.250 --> 17:04.285
What does that mean?
What did you do?

17:04.319 --> 17:05.319
Tell me!

17:06.492 --> 17:09.295
Look at him panicking.

17:09.329 --> 17:14.338
He's failed you,
just like he's failed them.

17:14.372 --> 17:18.310
No. You're my only failure!

17:20.517 --> 17:22.286
Liar!

17:25.861 --> 17:28.263
Go! Help Able!

17:28.298 --> 17:29.566
<i>Go!</i>

17:32.506 --> 17:35.477
I should have done this a long time ago.

17:35.511 --> 17:40.386
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

17:42.491 --> 17:44.360
Come on!

17:48.302 --> 17:51.607
Say it!
Say I'm stronger than you!

17:51.641 --> 17:56.148
- Say I'm smarter!
- No.

18:09.541 --> 18:13.213
I want you to perish with
the words on your lips.

18:27.408 --> 18:32.482
Tell me I deserve to be
your successor. Call me...

18:32.516 --> 18:34.252
Tron!

18:34.287 --> 18:37.624
- Never.
- Say it!

18:37.660 --> 18:41.198
How predictable.

18:41.233 --> 18:44.171
No. Ohh...

18:44.205 --> 18:45.306
No!

18:45.340 --> 18:46.441
Got it!

18:49.582 --> 18:53.288
Able, you still haven't
told us how we ended up here.

18:53.323 --> 18:55.458
Yeah, who did this to us?

18:55.492 --> 18:57.094
With all that's happened,

18:57.095 --> 18:59.499
I'm surprised you haven't
figured it out already.

18:59.534 --> 19:01.369
The program who attacked you is...

19:04.507 --> 19:06.244
Able!

19:25.415 --> 19:26.482
Run!!!

19:27.585 --> 19:29.554
<i>Able!</i>

19:43.515 --> 19:44.549
Zed...

20:02.750 --> 20:05.388
<i>Is she okay?</i>

20:05.422 --> 20:09.494
<i>- She may need help.
- Is she okay?</i>

20:10.765 --> 20:13.268
Oh. You're alive.

20:16.275 --> 20:19.246
<i>There he is! That's him!</i>

20:19.280 --> 20:20.649
<i>He did this!</i>

20:20.684 --> 20:23.387
He killed Able.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.427
What? Mara, no!

20:26.461 --> 20:29.532
He did this! He killed Able!

20:29.566 --> 20:31.369
<i>It's the Renegade!
It's the killer!</i>

20:31.403 --> 20:35.308
Able... No, wait!

20:35.343 --> 20:38.348
<i>Get him!</i>

20:38.350 --> 20:40.619
<i>You've been nothing but trouble!</i>

20:40.653 --> 20:43.324
<i>We don't need you!</i>

20:43.359 --> 20:45.594
<i>Go on! Leave us alone!</i>

21:03.362 --> 21:05.464
<i>Able's gone.</i>

21:07.403 --> 21:09.506
<i>The city's against you.</i>

21:11.510 --> 21:14.315
<i>Your friends blame you for it all.</i>

21:19.525 --> 21:21.595
And it's only going to get worse.

21:25.502 --> 21:26.570
I know.

21:29.677 --> 21:31.613
And I'm ready.
