WEBVTT

00:08.376 --> 00:09.777
Don't worry.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.412
You'll see, it'll be
like you never left.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.447
Connor, last time
people from work saw me,

00:13.481 --> 00:16.517
I was strapped to a gurney,
screaming about rats.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.086
Look, they understand.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.820
You were sick,
and now you're not.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.389
Everything's gonna be fine.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.591
And if you need me,
which you won't,

00:23.624 --> 00:26.694
I'm on trauma service today,
so I will be in the E.D., okay?

00:31.232 --> 00:33.067
But you have to tell me.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.668
And violate the sacred oath?

00:34.702 --> 00:37.371
It's not like
you're guarding the Holy Grail.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.541
It's a holiday gift exchange.
That we call "Secret Santa,"

00:40.574 --> 00:42.443
because we're supposed
to keep it a secret.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.578
Okay, so who is it? Is it April?

00:44.612 --> 00:46.247
I'm not gonna tell ya.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.781
Fine, don't tell me,

00:47.815 --> 00:50.184
but it's only a matter of time
before you crack.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.420
Not a chance.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.291
Can I grab you for a sec?

00:57.325 --> 01:00.128
- Something to show you.
- Sure.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.131
Look who it is.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.199
Hi.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.168
- Robin?
- Welcome back.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.770
There she is. Hello, Robin.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.106
- You look great.
- Doesn't she?

01:12.140 --> 01:13.574
Wait till she snaps again.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.709
She was cleared
to come back to work.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.721
She's Dr. Charles's daughter.
They're gonna say no?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.313
You too.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.790
See, I told you
it would all be fine.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.650
Coffee at 11:00?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.518
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.157
There you are.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.159
You look great, honey.
I'd be a lot better

01:31.192 --> 01:33.161
if everyone stopped
telling me that.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.596
Help! I need a doctor! Hurry!

01:35.629 --> 01:38.666
- We need some help over here!
- Dr. Choi, with me.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.270
He's having chest pain.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.472
Sir, can you hear me?

01:44.505 --> 01:46.440
Sir? No pulse. Get on his chest!

01:46.474 --> 01:48.342
Grab his arms.

01:48.376 --> 01:51.145
All right, on my count.
Ready? One, two, three.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.685
- What's the matter with Santa?
- It's all right, honey.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.253
Let's get him to a room.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.389
- Gurney.
- We're on it.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.224
He thought it was
just indigestion.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.634
I told him we should
call an ambulance.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.195
- Is Santa going to die?
- No, no, sweetie,

02:07.228 --> 02:09.463
we're going to take
very good care of him.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.199
Still no pulse. We gotta move.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.800
Let's get a crash cart ready!

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.742 --> 02:24.845
Massive MI. We hit him
with five rounds of epi.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.847
There was no bringing him back.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.483
Poor man. Name's Bill Cooper.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.253
He's been Santainresidence
at Water Tower Place

02:32.286 --> 02:34.288
for the past 25 years.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.390
Saint Nick dying
in our waiting room?

02:36.424 --> 02:38.292
Not a good look for us.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.861
You let me know
the second his family arrives.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.430
- Yes, ma'am.
- Incoming!

02:42.463 --> 02:44.898
Monique, you're on deck.
Dr. Rhodes?

02:47.635 --> 02:49.770
Pedro Suarez, 30yearold male.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.440
Fell 20 feet off his roof
stringing Christmas lights.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.408
GCS of 8.
King airway in the field.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.944
Initially hypotensive, but
responded to a liter of fluids.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.779
Please tell me
my son is gonna be okay.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.281
Mr. Suarez, I promise you

03:00.314 --> 03:02.216
we're gonna do
everything we can.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.917
All right,
everybody on my count.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.954
One, two, three.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.889
Thank you.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.730
Sats are 86 and falling fast.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.442
I'm not getting
breath sounds on the left.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.234
He's got a tension pneumothorax.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.845
Let's decompress him
and put a chest tube in.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.971
Needle?

03:24.004 --> 03:25.539
Straight up.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.243
Sats and blood pressure
are coming up.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.445
All right.
I'm gonna place the tube.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.581
Scalpel?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.718
Hey, come on.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.827
- That's not blood.
- Nope.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.896
That's...

03:48.929 --> 03:50.664
That's fecal matter.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.867
Fecal matter? How did
he get poop in his chest?

03:56.837 --> 03:59.307
Vincent Kramer, went through
a stained glass window.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.741
Found him wandering the streets.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.352
Mr. Kramer,
can you tell me what happened?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.478
They're coming for me,
the demons!

04:04.512 --> 04:06.380
BP, 86 over palp.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.915
Arterial bleed in his forearm.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.959
Tourniquet applied in the
field, but he's still bleeding.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.452
Okay, let's transfer
on my count,

04:11.485 --> 04:13.754
and watch out for
the glass, okay?

04:13.787 --> 04:16.290
Ready? One, two, three.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.493
Doris, let's take
a look at his arm.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.295
Wait, did you see them?
The demons?

04:21.329 --> 04:22.763
Try to stay calm, Mr. Kramer.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.965
- They're after me!
- Heart rate, 134.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.502
That's hypotensive.
Bolus a liter of LR,

04:28.536 --> 04:29.813
and give him two units
of uncrossmatched blood

04:29.837 --> 04:31.505
on the rapid transfuser.
Yes, doctor.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.775
All right,
it severed his radial artery.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.510
Give me a hemostat
and a silk tie.

04:36.544 --> 04:37.721
We need to get control
and tie it off.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.847
They're here. Please believe me.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.416
We got you, Mr. Kramer.
Just try to stay calm.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.352
No, no, no.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.054
No, no, no. My God.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.989
Got it.
Bleeding's under control.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.558
Can't you see them?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.493
Blood pressure's improving.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.929
Demons, everywhere.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.465
Help me.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.999
We're going to, Mr. Kramer.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.403
Let's get him
in soft restraints,

05:02.436 --> 05:04.071
and we're gonna need
a psych consult.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.740
Get away from me.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.709
Get away from me.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.547
Okay, when did the fever
start, Mr. Rosenblatt?

05:13.581 --> 05:15.983
I felt funny Sunday,

05:16.016 --> 05:17.518
but... but that went away.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.654
Um, I definitely had
a fever Tuesday.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.689
Kay.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.557
Well, how specific should I be?

05:23.591 --> 05:26.093
Just answer
the question, Harold.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.828
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday. Kay.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.830
And don't forget about the rash.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.437
Okay, let's get a chest Xray,

05:36.470 --> 05:38.939
CBC, blood cultures,
and start him on fluids.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.574
He's jaundiced.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.586
A liver panel and a CT scan
probably couldn't hurt.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.078
Thank you, nurse. That's what
I was about to suggest.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.981
Let, Radiology know
that we're sending him up.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.451
All right, Mr. Rosenblatt,
can you please put that on?

05:50.484 --> 05:52.095
And you might wanna leave
any valuables you have

05:52.119 --> 05:53.587
- with your wife.
- Wife?

05:53.621 --> 05:55.088
She's my sister.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.590
And housemate

05:56.624 --> 05:58.792
who told you
we should've come in earlier.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.728
- Give it a rest, Sylvia.
- Fine.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.963
Next time,
I'll just let you die.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.798
How does that work for you?

06:04.832 --> 06:07.134
Anything is better than
listening to you.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.836
Okay, um, we'll be back

06:08.869 --> 06:11.539
to check on you guys
after that scan.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.746
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Daniel,

06:18.779 --> 06:21.849
I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.485
The man who shot you,
Jack Kellogg,

06:24.518 --> 06:26.787
was killed in prison
this morning.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.624
- How?
- All I know is that

06:30.658 --> 06:33.761
he was murdered
by another inmate.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.963
You predicted
something like this.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.966
You didn't think he should go
to prison in the first place.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.902
- No, I didn't.
- And you were upset

06:41.935 --> 06:46.039
with Dr. Reese for testifying
for the prosecution.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.510
And?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.211
I just hope

06:51.244 --> 06:53.447
you don't take this out on her.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.815
Do you really think I'd do that?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.216
I'm sorry,

06:56.249 --> 07:00.120
but given how upset you were
that she testified,

07:00.153 --> 07:02.556
I didn't know
how you would react.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.725
I know this is difficult.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.760
Why don't you just
take a few days off?

07:06.794 --> 07:08.228
So not only am I vindictive,

07:08.261 --> 07:09.797
I'm emotionally unstable?

07:09.830 --> 07:11.799
You know what, I'd rather work.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.001
But I sure do
appreciate the offer.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.669
Daniel...

07:15.703 --> 07:17.170
Come on...

07:17.204 --> 07:18.472
Daniel.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.012
Fever, rash, jaundiced skin.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.224
I'm sure you noticed
his conjunctivitis.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.650
I was getting there.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.885
By any chance,
was the rash purple?

07:31.919 --> 07:33.887
- Yeah. Why?
- Stohl had a patient

07:33.921 --> 07:37.057
with the exact same symptoms
three days ago.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.561
The cultures just came in.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.598
Leptospirosis?

07:44.632 --> 07:46.534
- It's bacterial, right?
- Yeah.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.235
Stohl's guy went into DIC.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.103
Disseminated Intravascular
Coagulation.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.839
I know what it is.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.041
Are we looking at an outbreak?

07:54.074 --> 07:56.076
I'll page Robin Charles.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.781
So, his colon's in his chest?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.783
Diaphragm ruptured
from the impact of the fall.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.786
Stomach, spleen, and colon were
ripped from the abdominal wall,

08:05.819 --> 08:07.855
and migrated
into the left chest.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.657
I hate when that happens.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.100
The O.R. is being prepped
for surgery right now.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.627
You'll do the thoracotomy,
while I open his abdomen.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.730
- All right.
- And just as a reminder,

08:16.764 --> 08:18.198
I am on trauma service today,

08:18.231 --> 08:19.767
and this is
a trauma surgery, so...

08:19.800 --> 08:21.569
So you'll be attending
on the case,

08:21.602 --> 08:24.805
and you're going to get your
kicks out of calling the shots?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.807
I'm delighted to assist you,
Dr. Rhodes.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.576
I'm glad to hear that.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.611
- Shall we?
- Okay.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.145
Boss?

08:35.982 --> 08:37.250
Dr. Charles?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.251
Um... I, um...

08:39.285 --> 08:42.089
I heard about Jack Kellogg.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.591
I am so sorry.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.934
It's exactly what you said
would happen.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.261
He was a very troubled man

08:48.295 --> 08:49.763
who brought things on himself.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.164
Yes, but if he had been remanded

08:51.198 --> 08:54.835
to a psychiatric facility,
like you wanted...

08:54.868 --> 08:56.637
III just feel so awful.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.338
Listen, Dr. Reese,
if you're thinking

08:58.371 --> 09:02.676
that in some way,
this might've been your fault,

09:02.710 --> 09:04.011
it just wasn't.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.779
He was a very
selfdestructive guy,

09:05.813 --> 09:07.748
and there's just no guarantee

09:07.781 --> 09:09.349
the outcome would've been
any different,

09:09.382 --> 09:11.952
no matter where he ended up.
Dr. Charles-excuse me...

09:11.985 --> 09:15.088
Um, you available for a consult?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.924
Yes, we are.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.792
Name is Vincent Kramer,
homeless man.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.828
Delusional, combative.
We have him in restraints.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.863
I'm the only one
trying to help you.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.666
Don't you see them? The demons!

09:25.699 --> 09:27.234
They're here.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.136
No one is safe.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.773
Why don't you listen?
Actually, Dr. Charles,

09:32.806 --> 09:34.975
there's some patients
I need to check on upstairs.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.352
That is why
they keep coming back.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.111
- Okay.
- They won't stop.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.313
They will find me.
They were looking for me.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.950
The paramedics say he somehow
went through a window.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.384
No one is safe!

09:44.417 --> 09:45.853
Poor fella.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.021
Mr. Kramer? I'm Dr. Charles.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.857
I can't stop them.
Nobody can stop them.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.825
They're gonna find me here.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.894
- Them?
- The demons.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.829
You know what,
I can understand how...

09:55.863 --> 09:57.765
How demons would be
very frightening.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.366
They're gonna take me with them.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.901
I'm not gonna let that happen.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.903
You're safe here.
Five of Olanzapine.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.405
- Yes, doctor.
- Safe?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.774
We're giving you something

10:06.807 --> 10:08.175
that's gonna
calm you down a bit,

10:08.208 --> 10:09.719
and you should be
feeling better pretty soon.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.782
- Better?
- Yeah.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.850
I'm just gonna
step out for a bit,

10:16.884 --> 10:18.285
and when I come back, you and I,

10:18.318 --> 10:22.222
we're gonna start
to figure this out, all right?

10:22.255 --> 10:23.757
Okay.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.062
Gonna let the Olanzapine
mellow him out a bit,

10:29.096 --> 10:30.898
and, come back
and see if I can get

10:30.931 --> 10:32.332
a better picture
of what's going on.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.801
Yeah.

10:36.003 --> 10:39.239
- Leptospiwhat?
- Leptospirosis.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.241
It's a bacterial infection.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.219
We're starting you on
a broad spectrum antibiotic.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.378
It's all that pork you eat.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.782
Moo shu, bacon, it's treif.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.218
- Treif?
- Not kosher.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.187
Actually, the disease is
most commonly carried

10:54.221 --> 10:56.223
by rodents, rats,

10:56.256 --> 10:58.091
rat urine, specifically,

10:58.125 --> 11:00.994
usually through water
that's been contaminated.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.096
What the hell have you
been drinking, Harold?

11:03.130 --> 11:05.833
Will you stop nagging
and let her finish?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.868
There have been
a couple cases, recently.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.202
I need to ask you some questions

11:09.236 --> 11:12.139
to see if your case
is connected.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.942
Okay, can you think of anywhere
you have been recently,

11:14.975 --> 11:16.977
where you may have come
in contact with rats?

11:17.010 --> 11:20.380
Like an attic or basement?

11:20.413 --> 11:23.316
Anywhere you might've been
exposed to contaminated water?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.786
You've been swimming at the Y.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.488
I told you to join the JCC.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.257
She's talking to me, Sylvia.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.893
Kay, we'll see if the Y has
reported a recent infestation.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.394
Anything else you can think of?

11:34.427 --> 11:36.363
You sure it's not the pork?

11:42.169 --> 11:44.471
I'm so sorry for your loss.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.009
My sister would like to
move him to a funeral home.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.811
How long do you need
to keep him here?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.412
Normally, a day or two,

11:52.445 --> 11:54.181
but I'll ask
the medical examiner

11:54.214 --> 11:56.784
to release his body
this afternoon.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.086
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.963
Hey, Dr. Rhodes,

12:09.997 --> 12:11.374
just wanted to let you know
Radiology's uploading

12:11.398 --> 12:13.300
your patient's latest scans.
Thank you.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.335
Hey, will you do me a favor?
If you see Robin,

12:15.368 --> 12:17.113
will you tell her that
I got pulled into surgery?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.772
I'm not gonna make
our coffee date.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.440
Sure, but she's
probably busy too.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.375
Three cases of Leptospirosis.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.477
Lepto?

12:24.511 --> 12:27.347
Isn't that a rat disease?

12:27.380 --> 12:30.050
Yeah, it can be.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.320
Just what she needs today.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.826
I was doing the laundry,
and the next thing I know,

12:38.859 --> 12:40.260
I started cramping.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.362
Are these contractions?
I'm only 22 weeks.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.833
Okay, um, let's get a CBC
and UA with culture.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.267
Is there anyone we should call?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.002
My husband's away
at a legal conference,

12:49.036 --> 12:50.337
but he was having trouble

12:50.370 --> 12:51.972
catching a flight
out of Buffalo.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.082
Is everything okay with my baby?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.175
Let's take a look, okay?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.486
All right,
there's the heartbeat.

13:06.519 --> 13:11.191
Head circumference measuring
at about 178 millimeters.

13:11.224 --> 13:15.028
Looks like a normal, healthy
22weekold fetus to me.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.563
Thank God.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.231
All right,
so we'll run those tests

13:18.265 --> 13:20.400
and go from there, okay?
And don't worry, Shannon,

13:20.433 --> 13:22.903
we're gonna take really
good care of you and your baby.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.604
Okay?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.840
Thank you.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.842
Harold? Harold?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.446
We need to intubate.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.149
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
My God.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.161
Ms. Rosenblatt, it's okay.
Please, wait out here,

13:38.185 --> 13:40.020
- until we're finished.
- Harold!

13:40.053 --> 13:42.122
- Get me an ET tube.
- Harold...

13:49.930 --> 13:51.865
I... I can't. I can't get it in.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.433
It's... it's too much
blood, suction.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.402
Sats are down to 76.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.638
I still can't get it in.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.540
Noah...

14:00.573 --> 14:01.942
I'll get another doctor.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.277
No!

14:04.311 --> 14:06.980
He needs a surgical airway.
A crich? Really?

14:09.449 --> 14:10.918
Splash prep on his neck.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.554
Sterilizing.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.289
Give me a knife.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.900
I'm in.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.335
Bag him.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.305
Heart rate's 140.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.910
You did it.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.578
Of course I did it.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.654
Shannon?

14:49.622 --> 14:52.159
How are you feeling?
All better now.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.127
I'm so sorry
I wasn't here sooner.

14:54.161 --> 14:57.130
I cancelled all my meetings,
got on the first flight out.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.331
How's the baby?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.233
Dr. Manning was just explaining.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.534
- Hi, um...
- Hi.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.436
Well, I think
it's just a case of

15:03.470 --> 15:05.381
Braxton Hicks contractions,
practice contractions.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.207
Nothing to be concerned about.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.717
However, I would like to
just run one more test,

15:08.741 --> 15:11.278
just to ensure that
it's not preterm labor.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.380
If that's all clear,
then you should be good to go.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.682
What a relief.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.218
Man, is it me
or is it hot in here?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.253
Mr. Kim, everything okay?

15:20.287 --> 15:22.089
Throat's just a little dry.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.432
Is there any way
I can get some water?

15:23.456 --> 15:25.658
Definitely.
Your color is a bit off.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.460
Have you had any fever,
headaches?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.629
I'm probably just worn down
from the travel.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.240
Well, how 'bout I give you
a quick looksee,

15:31.264 --> 15:33.300
run a few tests? But Shannon...

15:33.333 --> 15:36.069
Go ahead, honey.
You do look a little pale.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.670
I'll have you back in no time.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.209
Honey, I won't be far.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.314
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.316
First time dads.

15:53.053 --> 15:56.223
Are you sure Robin was ready
to come back to work?

15:56.256 --> 15:57.390
Let's get that tube out

15:57.424 --> 16:00.027
before it contaminates
his chest.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.629
I only ask because we had
an antiNMDA patient

16:02.662 --> 16:04.297
at Groote Schuur.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.099
She had psychotic episodes
for a full year

16:06.133 --> 16:07.767
after the tumor was removed.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.402
Tubes out.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.704
Staple the colon,
before it leaks anymore stool.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.540
Already on it.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.476
Tough on you?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.678
Always wondering
if she'll flip out again?

16:23.350 --> 16:26.419
I'm gonna pull the colon
back down into the abdomen.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.988
You'll need to guide it
from the top.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.360
Got it.

16:33.393 --> 16:38.331
All right, colon is
repaired and reduced.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.799
Dr. Bekker,
let's irrigate the chest

16:39.832 --> 16:43.403
with 10 liters of saline.
Right away, Dr. Rhodes.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.205
And open a 10by20 GoreTex patch

16:45.238 --> 16:46.773
to reconstruct the diaphragm.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.808
I will be back to put it in.
Where are you going?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.154
It'll take you at least 30
minutes to clean out the chest.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.779
I'll be back then.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.485
He's going to check
on his girlfriend.

17:00.753 --> 17:05.058
I think I should get a manual
differential on his CBC.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.394
And maybe another chest Xray.

17:07.426 --> 17:10.563
Of course. I know that.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.265
Right.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.635
And I'm sure you won't forget
about sputum cultures.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.436
- Will you stop it?
- Wha... what?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.406
I'm sick of you telling me
how to do my job.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.574
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, you're not.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.410
I don't need a big sister here.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.179
I know what I'm doing.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.480
Back off.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.397
That's two cases
in the last week,

17:44.431 --> 17:47.234
and you know of one
at East Mercy?

17:47.267 --> 17:49.536
Have you found a common vector?

17:50.603 --> 17:54.374
Yeah. Are they
clustered geographically?

17:54.407 --> 17:55.818
Okay, I'll need
charts on all of them,

17:55.842 --> 17:58.711
and let me know
if anymore turn up. Thanks.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.787
Robin?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.455
What happened?

18:42.489 --> 18:44.224
Nothing. I'm fine.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.692
What are you doing out here?

18:45.725 --> 18:49.262
Just my office.
I needed some air.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.298
Robin, what's going on?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.500
- Connor...
- What?

18:55.435 --> 18:57.504
I heard them again.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.440
- Rats?
- In my office, and...

19:00.473 --> 19:03.310
Okay. Honey.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.313
Don't worry...

19:06.346 --> 19:08.348
I'm gonna take
care of you, okay?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.820
But you're not seeing 'em now?

19:15.388 --> 19:17.757
They're gone.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.727
What do you think they want,
the demons?

19:20.760 --> 19:23.763
To get inside me.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.332
That's what they do.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.201
They get inside people,

19:28.235 --> 19:30.203
make them do things.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.205
They got inside of my friend.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.408
I had to get away.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.977
Yeah. And that's
when you hurt yourself?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.447
Yes.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.983
The window, I had...

19:44.016 --> 19:46.586
I had to get through it.

19:46.619 --> 19:50.357
How long have they
been after ya?

19:50.390 --> 19:53.826
A long, long time.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.328
Years.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.996
Running all that time,

19:57.029 --> 20:00.367
hiding, I mean,
it sounds exhausting.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.469
You must be very tired.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.571
Tired...

20:06.806 --> 20:09.909
- I am so tired.
- Yeah.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.644
You know, Vince,

20:11.678 --> 20:14.781
I can provide you with
a place where you can rest.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.516
Would you like that?

20:16.549 --> 20:19.352
Clean bed, shower,

20:19.386 --> 20:21.254
a place where you can feel safe.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.326
- Yes, I would like that.
- Okay.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.960
Okay.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.462
Great.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.704
So?

20:37.737 --> 20:40.473
Hallucinations, paranoia,

20:40.507 --> 20:42.309
hyperreligiosity.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.544
This is definitely some kinda
delusional disorder.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.012
Bipolar 1, maybe?

20:46.045 --> 20:47.647
I'll wanna have him admitted,

20:47.680 --> 20:49.649
you know, for a full
psychological evaluation.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.427
Okay, I'll start working on
the transfer order.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.286
- Thanks.
- Sure.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.628
You said you travel a lot,

21:01.661 --> 21:03.563
so I thought of West Nile Virus.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.432
I ran a mosquito panel.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.966
Good news is
you don't have West Nile.

21:06.999 --> 21:10.603
Here's the thing, you did test
inconclusive for Zika.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.440
Really? Zika? How?

21:13.473 --> 21:14.974
I'm wondering that myself.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.552
I mean, there hasn't been
a case of Zika reported

21:16.576 --> 21:18.645
north of the MasonDixon line.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.480
Have you visited
anywhere else recently?

21:20.513 --> 21:22.081
Maybe somewhere tropical?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.692
There have been a few cases
reported in South Florida.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.985
No, I haven't been to Florida.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.854
Okay, well...

21:27.887 --> 21:30.423
regardless, the first thing
we have to do is test Shannon.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.991
Shannon? Why?

21:32.024 --> 21:33.802
Well, since Zika can be
sexually transmitted,

21:33.826 --> 21:35.728
Shannon could contract it,

21:35.762 --> 21:38.731
leaving the fetus at risk
of developing microcephaly,

21:38.765 --> 21:40.367
a devastating birth defect

21:40.400 --> 21:42.635
where the baby's brain
doesn't form properly.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.371
But we haven't
had sex in a week.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.005
I've been out of town.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.608
And you couldn't have
gotten Zika in Buffalo,

21:48.641 --> 21:50.510
so you must've picked it up
before that.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.878
It's important we test her.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.880
I don't wanna scare her
needlessly.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.515
Besides,
I'm feeling much better.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.892
Probably just had
a touch of the flu.

21:56.916 --> 21:57.984
Mr. Kim...

21:58.017 --> 21:59.886
I really need to
get back to Shannon.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.489
I'm sorry, am I...
Am I missing something here?

22:04.657 --> 22:07.494
Okay. I wasn't in Buffalo.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.496
I was in Aruba...

22:09.529 --> 22:11.631
with a lady friend.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.733
Look, I'm not concerned
with your personal life.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.636
I only care about my patient,
and in this situation,

22:16.669 --> 22:18.505
we have to consider your wife.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.507
No. She does not
find out about this.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.742
I'm not risking my marriage
over an inconclusive test.

22:22.775 --> 22:25.778
I don't think you understand.
Your baby's at risk.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.080
Shannon needs to know.
Dr. Halstead...

22:28.114 --> 22:30.417
they teach you about
doctorpatient confidentiality

22:30.450 --> 22:31.918
in med school?

22:31.951 --> 22:34.521
'Cause they definitely
covered it in law school.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.055
I'm your patient too now,

22:36.088 --> 22:39.392
and I'm telling you
to keep your mouth shut.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.194
Why do I have to do an MRI?

22:50.102 --> 22:51.804
We all know what is going on.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.706
The MRI will allow us
to see the extent

22:53.740 --> 22:55.107
of any lingering inflammation.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.143
This episode could end up
being a blessing.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.878
It'll help us adjust your meds.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.713
And there's nothing
to worry about.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.182
This is all part of
your recuperation process.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.817
Which is endless.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.586
I'll let the tech know
we're ready.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.087
Thank you.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.191
At least you don't have to
restrain me this time.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.526
Maybe later tonight.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.997
Hey, look, I have to
get back to the O.R.,

23:18.030 --> 23:21.167
but, I promise you,

23:21.200 --> 23:23.470
I will not be very long.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.880
We're starting another round
of antibiotics,

23:33.913 --> 23:35.882
hoping he'll turn a corner soon.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.486
I hate seeing him like this.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.555
Stubborn old fool.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.492
But he's still my baby brother.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.560
- He's lucky to have you.
- I love him,

23:47.594 --> 23:50.763
and I don't know
what I'd do without him.

23:50.797 --> 23:54.100
But he hocks me a chainik.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.536
This mishegas with Christmas.

23:56.569 --> 23:59.205
Forgive me, but enough
with all the lights,

23:59.238 --> 24:01.808
jingle bells, eggnog.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.643
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

24:03.676 --> 24:07.013
Harold's late wife,
Mary, lovely woman

24:07.046 --> 24:10.049
but she was a gentile.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.184
Catholic.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.487
They celebrated Christmas.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.988
He still does.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.058
Maybe it's his way
of remembering her.

24:19.091 --> 24:21.227
I suppose.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.630
Seems kinda sweet.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.265
Yeah...

24:26.298 --> 24:28.835
I guess it is.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.112
You were gone awhile.
Everything okay?

24:42.782 --> 24:44.116
Where are we?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.085
Just coming around
the posterior medial.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.020
You're just in time
for the hard part.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.656
Good.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.798
Every time the lung inflates,
the patch moves.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.933
Do you have an angle on it?

25:00.967 --> 25:02.201
No.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.203
All right, then we need
to deflate his lung.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.773
No. No way. Sats are too low.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.107
What if I use a LongAllisClamp

25:08.140 --> 25:09.685
to get behind the lung
and hold the patch?

25:09.709 --> 25:11.578
No, it's fine. I've got it.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.580
I've got room. I can do it.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.983
All right, go.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.284
Clamp.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.891
Patch is in place. Stitch away.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.869
No, I still can't reach
the crus of the diaphragm.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.695
Can you give me
some more torque?

25:28.728 --> 25:30.963
No, but I can finish
the stitches from here,

25:30.997 --> 25:34.000
if you hold the patch in place.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.835
Okay, your call.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.738
All right. Fine.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.619
I can't get in
the last few stitches.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.220
All right, Allis coming off.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.924
All right, finish the run.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.827
Look at you two, getting it
done like Jordan and Pippen.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.045
Your scan was clean.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.914
No residual edema or permanent
damage to your brain tissue.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.783
Great, so I'm just
losing my mind?

26:23.816 --> 26:26.753
- Robin, this is good news.
- It is?

26:26.786 --> 26:28.755
If it would make you
feel better,

26:28.788 --> 26:30.222
there are more tests we can run:

26:30.256 --> 26:33.793
An EEG, an autoimmune
antibody assay,

26:33.826 --> 26:35.795
a lumbar puncture...
Ooh, a spinal tap.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.229
Wow, that'll cheer me up.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.198
Robin, we are going
to figure this out.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.143
No, it's all pretty clear.
It's all in my head,

26:41.167 --> 26:42.902
and there's nothing
that you or Connor

26:42.935 --> 26:44.804
or anyone else can do.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.847
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.382
How's Shannon's husband?

26:56.415 --> 26:57.950
Bruce Kim?

26:57.984 --> 26:59.719
Turns out he wasn't in Buffalo.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.988
He was in Aruba
with another woman.

27:02.021 --> 27:05.024
Tested inconclusive for Zika.
What?

27:05.057 --> 27:07.660
Well, we have to test Shannon.
We can't,

27:07.694 --> 27:09.962
not without violating
his confidentiality.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.699
He refuses to tell her.
That's ridiculous.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.835
I mean, if he was HIV positive,
we could break confidentiality.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.704
Doesn't Zika get
the same exemption?

27:17.737 --> 27:19.906
No.
Unfortunately, Zika's so new,

27:19.939 --> 27:21.741
there's no legal precedent.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.776
But what if they have sex?

27:23.810 --> 27:25.311
What if he infects the fetus?

27:25.344 --> 27:27.714
I mean, you've seen babies
with microcephaly.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.091
Natalie,
I have spent the last hour

27:29.115 --> 27:30.983
trying to find
a way around HIPAA.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.352
I've got nothing.
He'll come after the hospital

27:33.385 --> 27:36.055
and my license, incidentally.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.725
- So you're just giving up?
- There's nothing we can do.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.827
We can't justify
breaking the law

27:40.860 --> 27:43.295
over an inconclusive
test result.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.433
I know what you're thinking.
Don't do anything.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.004
- Desmond, talk to me.
- Father Luke Novak,

27:52.038 --> 27:54.040
parish priest
over at St. Emmelia.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.742
Multiple stab wounds.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.019
You're going to Trauma 1.
Ben, you're in.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.145
Intubated in the field.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.380
Heart rate, 137.
BP, 70 over palp.

28:01.413 --> 28:02.749
Well, how did this happen?

28:02.782 --> 28:03.992
Somebody broke into the church.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.327
The priest must've
confronted him.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.919
All right,
let's transfer on my count.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.354
One, two, three.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.423
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.961
Call for two units.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.396
Stephanie,
take over compressions.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.233
Is that stained glass?

28:22.902 --> 28:25.404
Did you get the guy who did it?
Not yet.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.884
I'm gonna get someone
to look at it, I promise you.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.877
- $16,000?
- Sir...

28:30.910 --> 28:32.044
What in God's name?

28:32.078 --> 28:33.780
Sir, please, lower your voice.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.448
Excuse me,
what seems to be the problem?

28:36.482 --> 28:38.150
This.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.752
Tell me how I'm going to explain

28:39.786 --> 28:41.253
a $16,000 bill to my sister,

28:41.287 --> 28:43.322
who's already mourning
the death of her husband?

28:43.355 --> 28:44.891
He died in the waiting room.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.392
- $16,000...
- Yeah.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.360
You're as bad as
the pharmaceutical companies,

28:48.394 --> 28:51.063
profiting from our losses.
Mr. Williams, I promise you,

28:51.097 --> 28:53.332
I will personally
look into this.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.835
You're not gonna do
a damn thing.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.371
$16,000.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.908
I'd be mad too.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.451
So, we've got a mechanic,
a dry cleaner,

29:03.475 --> 29:05.477
a retiree,
and now three other patients,

29:05.511 --> 29:08.347
but they all live in
different parts of the city.

29:08.380 --> 29:11.250
Well, they have to be
connected somehow.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.052
Well, last Lepto outbreak
in Cook County

29:13.085 --> 29:14.887
was five years ago:

29:14.921 --> 29:17.123
A contaminated water
facility in Schaumburg.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.891
And ten years before that,

29:18.925 --> 29:20.502
migrant workers picked it up
on a farm downstate,

29:20.526 --> 29:22.561
so I've been thinking about
more than just water.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.230
Maybe contaminated soil,

29:24.263 --> 29:27.133
but this time of year,
there's not a lot of gardening.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.102
Well, it is Christmas.
What about Christmas trees,

29:30.136 --> 29:31.838
with everyone
bringing them home?

29:31.871 --> 29:33.015
Yeah, I thought
about that as well,

29:33.039 --> 29:34.807
but Harold and Lydia Rosenblatt?

29:34.841 --> 29:35.984
I mean, they're Jewish, right?

29:36.008 --> 29:37.409
Would they get a Christmas tree?

29:37.443 --> 29:39.045
Harold may be Jewish,

29:39.078 --> 29:41.513
but I know for a fact,
he celebrates Christmas.

29:44.150 --> 29:47.153
Our job is to treat patients,
not to bankrupt them.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.221
The man died
in the waiting room.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.857
After which
you had him transferred

29:50.890 --> 29:53.292
to a trauma room
and thoroughly examined.

29:53.325 --> 29:56.095
Okay, "Position fee,
room charge, supplies",

29:56.128 --> 29:58.264
maintenance to clean
and sterilize the room".

29:58.297 --> 29:59.899
These charges are
all legitimate.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.567
His wife has suffered enough.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.335
Can't we just look the other way

30:03.369 --> 30:05.204
on some of these things?

30:05.237 --> 30:07.840
You know as well as I do,
the E.D. is hemorrhaging money,

30:07.874 --> 30:09.117
and you wanna hand out freebies?

30:09.141 --> 30:13.512
I'm just asking
to adjust the bill.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.414
Ms. Goodwin...

30:15.447 --> 30:18.350
what's the big deal?
His insurance will cover this.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.887
And what if
he doesn't have insurance?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.254
Then they'll cry poverty

30:22.288 --> 30:24.056
and negotiate a lower bill.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.291
That's how it's done.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.259
At least we'll look responsible.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.227
Responsible?

30:28.260 --> 30:30.529
Fiscally responsible.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.398
Ms. Goodwin...

30:32.431 --> 30:34.566
I'm looking out for you.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.606
Get away from me!
No one is safe!

30:40.639 --> 30:42.074
Kramer, you need
to come with us.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.451
Listen to me,
the demons are here!

30:43.475 --> 30:45.187
Detective, what are
you doing to my patient?

30:45.211 --> 30:46.645
Dr. Charles,
you don't understand.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.323
- Why didn't you page me?
- You said I'd be safe.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.182
Dr. Charles, let us do our job.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.559
No, no, you give me a moment
and let me do mine.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.185
Vince, nobody's gonna hurt you.

30:53.219 --> 30:54.396
I'm not gonna let 'em
hurt you, all right?

30:54.420 --> 30:56.155
You can't stop them!

30:56.188 --> 30:57.556
Call a code silver!

30:57.589 --> 30:59.134
- Get away from me!
- Vince, look at me,

30:59.158 --> 31:00.626
- look at me.
- You lied to me.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.070
No, I didn't lie to you,
I promise.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.562
There's been
a big misunderstanding.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.507
Vince, look at me, look at me.
Right here. Nobody else.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.666
Ignore everybody else.
Look at me.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.235
What I need you to do,

31:09.268 --> 31:10.678
I need you to lower
the paddles, okay,

31:10.702 --> 31:12.438
so we can talk this out.

31:12.471 --> 31:16.008
I promise you,
everything is gonna be okay.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.176
All right?

31:17.209 --> 31:19.478
So just slowly... there you go.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.614
There you go. Nice and easy.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.085
- Liar!
- No!

31:26.118 --> 31:28.087
- No, don't!
- Charles!

31:43.702 --> 31:44.942
Dr. Charles, can you hear me?

31:46.305 --> 31:48.274
- Are you okay?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.409
Daniel, stop. You were shocked.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.187
Let me check your
heart rhythm, run an EKG.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.146
- I'm fine.
- Don't be stubborn.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.690
Dr. Charles,
you could've been killed.

31:55.714 --> 31:58.484
Where are you taking him?
What are the charges?

31:58.517 --> 32:00.386
Stop him. Can't you stop him?
No.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.430
And the what the hell were you
thinking, risking your life?

32:02.454 --> 32:03.689
It's a police matter.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.424
How did it become
a police matter?

32:05.457 --> 32:07.293
He's my patient. Let me explain-

32:07.326 --> 32:08.971
- Look, what, that is
a good idea to lock a man up

32:08.995 --> 32:11.030
who's in serious need,
of... of treatment?

32:11.063 --> 32:13.532
Put him behind bars, blow any
chance we have of helping him?

32:13.565 --> 32:15.434
- Dr. Charles, please.
- What did he do?

32:15.467 --> 32:17.236
He broke a window.
He stabbed a priest.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.172
What?

32:21.673 --> 32:25.044
Father Novak died
in our trauma room.

32:25.077 --> 32:27.746
He was covered in the same
stained glass as Vince.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.490
You... you know why he did it?

32:38.524 --> 32:41.027
Don't you?
It was because of Jack Kellogg.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.328
He couldn't save Jack Kellogg,

32:42.361 --> 32:44.730
so he tried to save this... man.

32:44.763 --> 32:47.033
I can't help but feel...

32:47.066 --> 32:49.601
It's not your fault, Dr. Reese.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.480
The antibiotics are working,
Mr. Rosenblatt.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.149
Your white blood cell
count has improved.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.251
Now, we still have a ways to go,

33:05.284 --> 33:06.518
but things are looking good.

33:06.552 --> 33:09.255
All because of a Christmas tree.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.490
Actually, it was
the Christmas tree lot.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.792
The trees were cultivated
in infected soil.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.228
Still, if you hadn't
brought that thing home...

33:16.262 --> 33:17.763
Sylvia...

33:17.796 --> 33:19.465
could we take a night off?

33:19.498 --> 33:22.601
Of course. You need your rest.

33:22.634 --> 33:25.037
Tomorrow, I'm gonna fix you

33:25.071 --> 33:27.639
a fresh pot of split pea.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.409
And if you're good,
I'll throw in a ham bone.

33:30.442 --> 33:33.312
I'll be back
to check in on you later.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.116
Okay, so Robin wants us
to update his chart

33:37.149 --> 33:38.589
so she can send it
to the health lab.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.352
You can do it.
You don't need my help.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.121
Really?

33:42.154 --> 33:43.489
That's a change.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.524
Okay, sometimes,
you need my help...

33:45.557 --> 33:47.726
- Okay.
- But...

33:47.759 --> 33:49.328
you know what,

33:49.361 --> 33:50.462
I need you too.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.299
Where's this coming from?

33:55.301 --> 33:57.736
I've just been thinking.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.109
Okay.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.477
So, what do you say,

34:05.511 --> 34:08.380
when we get to be their age,
we move in together.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.349
Not on your life.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.755
- Kay. Thank you.
- Let's go.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.159
These flowers are so beautiful.

34:23.329 --> 34:24.795
Kay, let's go.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.466
Thank you for everything,
Dr. Manning.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.400
Bruce brought me these.
Aren't they pretty?

34:29.435 --> 34:32.170
Um... um...

34:32.204 --> 34:36.208
um, before you go,
there's just one more thing.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.443
What?

34:39.145 --> 34:41.112
Since you're approaching
your delivery date,

34:41.147 --> 34:42.514
I think it's really important

34:42.547 --> 34:44.583
that you be cautious
with physical activity.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.585
Um, try not to lift
anything heavy,

34:46.618 --> 34:49.321
limit your stress, and, um...

34:49.355 --> 34:50.822
avoid sexual contact.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.425
Why? None of the books say
anything about avoiding sex.

34:53.458 --> 34:54.560
We're done here.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.597
I'm sorry, I... I think...

34:58.630 --> 35:00.499
I think there's something
you should know.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.868
- Um, you...
- Mr. Kim...

35:02.901 --> 35:05.437
This is Dr. Ellen Hart,
Epidemic Intelligent.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.473
Service Officer for the CDC.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.475
May I speak to you
in private, Mr. Kim?

35:09.508 --> 35:11.353
No, you can't. My wife
and I are on our way out.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.878
I'm sorry,
but federal law requires

35:12.911 --> 35:14.746
that I speak to you
about your test.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.449
What te...
What... what's going on?

35:17.483 --> 35:19.551
Dr. Hart will fill you in.

35:19.585 --> 35:22.321
Why don't we step
in here please?

35:32.731 --> 35:35.634
- What did you do?
- I made some calls.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.636
Since Zika's
a public health emergency,

35:37.669 --> 35:41.507
the CDC has to investigate
all inconclusive test results.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.675
I'm impressed.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.777
Natalie, back there,
were you gonna...

35:45.811 --> 35:47.379
Let's just say
it is a good thing

35:47.413 --> 35:49.515
you showed up when you did.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.353
So, are you keeping
anything from me?

35:54.386 --> 35:55.754
Well, I haven't been to Aruba,

35:55.787 --> 35:57.923
if that's what you're wondering.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.393
Actually, there is one thing,

36:01.427 --> 36:03.662
and this is just between us.

36:05.431 --> 36:06.665
Goodwin.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.534
I'm her secret Santa, all right,

36:08.567 --> 36:10.636
and I have no idea
what to get her.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.407
I'm really glad
you shared that with me.

36:15.441 --> 36:16.875
You know, she once told me

36:16.908 --> 36:18.944
that the first thing she does
when she gets home

36:18.977 --> 36:20.746
is take off her shoes.

36:20.779 --> 36:23.549
- So...
- House slippers.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.851
I'll help you pick 'em out.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.993
Sharon, I mean, what the hell?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.762
You blackmailed the board?

36:36.795 --> 36:39.865
All I did was explain that
it'd be very bad publicity

36:39.898 --> 36:43.269
if it got out that
we gave Santa's widow

36:43.302 --> 36:45.371
a bill for $16,000

36:45.404 --> 36:47.806
one week before Christmas.

36:47.839 --> 36:48.840
If it got out.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.709
The board took that as a threat.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.254
- What are they gonna do?
- Well, they got no choice

36:52.278 --> 36:53.979
but to forgive the charges.
Good.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.681
No, it's not good,

36:55.714 --> 36:57.916
They're not happy,
and believe me,

36:57.949 --> 37:00.719
they would have no qualms
about replacing you

37:00.752 --> 37:02.854
with someone who would
gladly bill Santa,

37:02.888 --> 37:06.258
the Easter Bunny,
and the Tooth Fairy.

37:06.292 --> 37:09.295
You need to watch your step.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.996
I hear you, Peter.

37:16.502 --> 37:19.004
Now, we were able to remove
all the stool contents

37:19.037 --> 37:21.673
from his chest cavity
and repair his diaphragm.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.751
It might be a little while
before he's back on a ladder,

37:23.775 --> 37:26.378
but he should make
a full recovery.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.879
Thank you for saving my son.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.749
- Thank you both.
- Of course.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.020
We made a pretty
good team today.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.922
We did.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.825
Thank you, doctor.
And sign this.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.928
Why don't you say we go
have a drink and celebrate?

37:42.961 --> 37:44.996
You wanna get a drink
with me? Seriously?

37:45.030 --> 37:46.898
You know, a little Don Corleone:

37:46.932 --> 37:49.768
"Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."

37:51.670 --> 37:53.639
Goodnight, Dr. Bekker.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.874
Yeah, goodnight, Dr. Rhodes.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.950
Dr. Charles?

38:04.983 --> 38:06.952
Are you okay?

38:06.985 --> 38:09.355
Yes. I'm okay.

38:09.388 --> 38:12.624
I mean, with everything
that's happened.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.993
I'm worried about you.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.529
You know, that's funny,
because...

38:17.563 --> 38:19.498
I've actually been
worried about you.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.400
What? Why?

38:21.433 --> 38:23.345
You know, this morning, when
they brought Mr. Kramer in,

38:23.369 --> 38:25.537
I thought you seemed...

38:25.571 --> 38:26.872
anxious about treating him.

38:26.905 --> 38:30.041
No. No, I told you,
I had patients to see.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.644
Okay.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.646
I, um...

38:34.680 --> 38:36.715
I guess I just hope that...

38:36.748 --> 38:39.084
That that's really the case.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.588
Um, good... goodnight,
Dr. Charles.

38:42.621 --> 38:43.822
Night.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.861
Come in.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.733
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.106
So...

39:01.139 --> 39:03.442
yeah, things got a little...

39:03.475 --> 39:05.076
out of hand today,

39:05.110 --> 39:06.945
and, um...

39:06.978 --> 39:09.981
you know, if the offer's still
good, I was thinking that...

39:10.015 --> 39:13.585
maybe I could use
a few days off.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.121
The offer's still good.

39:16.154 --> 39:19.124
Okay. Thank you.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.592
You're welcome.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.731
Don't stay away too long.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.165
We need you here.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.602
Tough day?

39:30.636 --> 39:33.004
We billed $16,000

39:33.038 --> 39:36.475
to a family of a man
who died in the waiting room.

39:36.508 --> 39:39.878
I managed to quash it, but...

39:39.911 --> 39:42.147
the system's broken, Daniel.

39:45.016 --> 39:47.619
Well... don't know
anybody better

39:47.653 --> 39:49.488
with a glue gun than you.

39:51.189 --> 39:54.426
Well, enjoy your holidays.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.027
You too.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.171
Why don't we take it easy
tonight, all right?

40:06.204 --> 40:07.873
We'll get the fire going.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.175
- Let me just get my stuff.
- All right.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.746
Hey, sorry for the intrusion.

40:14.780 --> 40:17.449
I had to get up
through your office.

40:17.483 --> 40:19.885
Heating unit is on the fritz.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.654
- The heater?
- Defective check valve.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.556
Noise must've been
driving you crazy.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.092
It's all fixed now.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.627
Thank you.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.699
It's good news.

40:33.732 --> 40:36.201
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

40:38.737 --> 40:41.172
So, what did you wanna show me?

40:41.206 --> 40:42.841
In here.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.716
Kiss me.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.087
Shamrocks?

40:56.121 --> 40:57.956
Wasn't any mistletoe...

40:57.989 --> 41:00.826
But I found a box of
St. Patty's Day decorations.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.628
It'll do.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.715
Merry Christmas.
