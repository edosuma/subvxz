00:29.367 --> 00:32.244
<i>Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.</i>

00:32.954 --> 00:34.998
<i>This must be distinctly understood...</i>

00:35.206 --> 00:40.628
<i>...or nothing wonderful can come
of this story I am going to relate.</i>

00:50.179 --> 00:54.892
<i>On Christmas night all Christians sing
To hear the news the angels bring</i>

00:55.560 --> 00:57.520
Thank you, sir.

00:57.770 --> 00:59.856
<i>To hear the news the angels bring</i>

02:31.363 --> 02:33.448
Holly! Get your Christmas holly!

02:47.546 --> 02:49.714
Seven years ago today.

02:49.965 --> 02:51.299
What's that you say?

02:51.550 --> 02:54.845
Mr. Marley died.
Seven years ago this very day.

02:55.095 --> 02:56.721
Would it be too much to ask...

02:56.930 --> 03:00.350
...that you return to the work
for which I pay you so handsomely?

03:00.559 --> 03:03.061
Mr. Cratchit!

03:03.478 --> 03:06.189
The fire's gone cold, Mr. Scrooge.

03:07.023 --> 03:09.317
Come over here, Mr. Cratchit.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.447
- What is this?
- A shirt.

03:16.282 --> 03:18.368
- And this?
- A waistcoat.

03:18.910 --> 03:21.246
- And this?
- A coat.

03:22.539 --> 03:24.124
These are garments.

03:24.374 --> 03:27.877
Garments were invented
as protection against the cold.

03:28.127 --> 03:30.880
Once purchased,
they may be used indefinitely...

03:31.089 --> 03:33.591
...for the purpose
for which they are intended.

03:33.841 --> 03:37.053
Coal burns.

03:38.846 --> 03:41.557
Coal is momentary, and coal is costly.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.353
There will be no more coal
burnt in this office today.

03:45.645 --> 03:48.189
- Is that quite clear, Mr. Cratchit?
- Yes, sir.

03:48.439 --> 03:51.192
Get back to work
before I'm forced to conclude...

03:51.401 --> 03:53.778
...that your services
are no longer required.

03:54.237 --> 03:55.613
Yes, sir.

04:04.372 --> 04:07.750
- Merry Christmas, Bob Cratchit.
- The same to you, Mr. Fred.

04:11.254 --> 04:13.130
Merry Christmas, Uncle.

04:14.257 --> 04:16.676
I said, merry Christmas, Uncle.

04:18.094 --> 04:19.720
Humbug.

04:19.971 --> 04:21.680
Christmas, a humbug, Uncle?

04:22.181 --> 04:25.101
- Surely you don't mean that.
- I do.

04:25.351 --> 04:26.602
What's Christmas...

04:26.852 --> 04:29.605
...but a time for buying things...

04:29.814 --> 04:32.733
...for which you have no need,
no money?

04:33.317 --> 04:38.572
Time for finding yourself
a year older, not an hour richer.

04:39.949 --> 04:41.617
If I could work my will...

04:41.867 --> 04:45.246
...every idiot who has
"Merry Christmas" on his lips...

04:45.454 --> 04:48.040
...should be boiled
in his own pudding...

04:48.290 --> 04:51.585
...and buried with a stake of hollies
through his heart.

04:52.169 --> 04:53.212
Come now, Uncle.

04:53.462 --> 04:57.925
You keep Christmas in your way,
and let me keep it in mine.

04:58.175 --> 04:59.510
You don't keep it.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.553
Let me leave it alone then!

05:04.515 --> 05:07.351
Much good it may do you.
Much good it has done you.

05:07.559 --> 05:10.813
There are many things
in which I might have derived good...

05:11.021 --> 05:14.441
...from which I have not profited.
Christmas, among the rest.

05:15.275 --> 05:19.071
But I've always thought
of Christmastime as a good time...

05:19.279 --> 05:21.740
...a kindlier, forgiving,
charitable time...

05:21.990 --> 05:24.660
...when men and women
see their one consent...

05:24.910 --> 05:29.248
...to open their shut-up hearts
freely to their fellow creatures.

05:30.123 --> 05:34.086
Though it has never put a scrap
of gold or silver into my pocket...

05:34.336 --> 05:37.381
...I do believe
that it has done me good.

05:37.839 --> 05:40.467
And I say, God bless it.

05:45.555 --> 05:47.808
Not a sound from you.

05:48.308 --> 05:52.187
And you'll keep your Christmas
by losing your situation.

05:54.564 --> 05:58.527
You're a powerful speaker.
I wonder you don't go into Parliament.

05:58.777 --> 06:02.405
Please don't be angry, Uncle.
Come. Dine with us tomorrow.

06:02.656 --> 06:06.117
Dine? I'd see myself in hell first.

06:06.409 --> 06:09.829
It would be a great joy to me.
And to my wife.

06:10.121 --> 06:11.665
Yes, your wife.

06:11.915 --> 06:15.168
I'm told she brought little
to the marriage. A poor girl.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.003
I love her.

06:17.796 --> 06:19.089
And she loves me.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.591
Love.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.552
Good afternoon, Nephew.

06:28.264 --> 06:30.141
I want nothing from you.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.227
I ask nothing of you.

06:32.977 --> 06:37.649
- Why can't we be friends?
- You are wasting my time.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.568
I'm sorry to find you so resolute.

06:40.777 --> 06:43.279
We've never had a quarrel,
so far as I know.

06:44.989 --> 06:49.535
And so I shall keep my good humor
and wish you a merry Christmas.

06:49.953 --> 06:53.289
- Goodbye.
- And a happy New Year.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.503
- How's that fine family of yours?
- Well. All very well.

06:58.753 --> 07:01.672
- You'll give them my best wishes?
- Yes, I shall.

07:01.923 --> 07:03.800
- Goodbye, Cratchit.
- Goodbye, sir.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.802
And a merry Christmas.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.678
Idiot.

07:09.889 --> 07:14.143
And he's made me late to Bushnel.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.940
I'm off to the Exchange.

07:19.315 --> 07:22.276
- Don't lock up a moment early.
- No, sir.

07:31.661 --> 07:34.872
You'll want all day tomorrow,
I suppose?

07:35.539 --> 07:38.751
- If it's quite convenient, sir.
- It is not convenient.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.836
And it's not fair.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.340
If I were to hold back half a crown
from your pay for it...

07:44.548 --> 07:48.260
...you'd think yourself ill-used.
But you don't think me ill-used...

07:48.511 --> 07:51.305
...when I pay a day's wages
for no work.

07:51.931 --> 07:53.641
Christmas comes once a year.

07:54.391 --> 07:59.605
Poor excuse for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.566
But I suppose you must have it.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.111
- Be here earlier the next morning.
- Yes, sir, I shall.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.572
- Make sure.
- Yes, sir.

08:09.156 --> 08:13.369
- And a merry Christmas to you.
- Humbug!

08:26.507 --> 08:28.884
Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.886
Don't beg on this corner, boy.

08:31.136 --> 08:34.640
I'm not begging, sir.
I'm Tim. Tim Cratchit.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.683
I'm waiting for my father.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.688
Tim Cratchit, huh? Well then,
you'll have a long wait, won't you?

08:42.397 --> 08:45.692
- Thank you, sir.
- Humbug.

08:49.905 --> 08:54.451
<i>Our Savior Christ and His Lady
On Christmas day</i>

08:54.659 --> 08:58.038
<i>Our Savior Christ and His Lady
On Christmas day in the morning</i>

08:58.246 --> 09:01.333
Clear the road. Out of the way.
Let me through.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.556
Merry Christmas, sir.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.101
Merry Christmas, sir.

09:32.155 --> 09:35.033
The 18th of January.
The 18th of January.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.746
The open market. Open market?
Buying here. Buying.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.875
- We were afraid you weren't coming.
- It's almost closing, sir.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.044
- I'm here.
- I said you'd be here.

09:46.294 --> 09:50.798
- I knew you'd change your mind.
- You're right. I've changed my mind.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.885
- Then you'll take our bid?
- The price has gone up.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.970
Gone up? That's not possible.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.806
You want my corn,
you must meet my quote.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.017
Plus five percent for the delay.

10:01.225 --> 10:04.437
You'll be left with a warehouse
stuffed with corn.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.939
- That's my affair.
- If we pay your price...

10:07.148 --> 10:09.776
...our bread will be dearer.
The poor will suffer.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.819
Buy the corn someplace else.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.321
Scrooge, a moment.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.782
We'll take your corn at the price
you quoted yesterday.

10:16.991 --> 10:20.161
Too late. Tomorrow it'll cost
you another five percent.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.537
It's not fair!

10:21.787 --> 10:24.123
No. But it's business.

10:24.373 --> 10:27.251
I'll give you a moment
to make up your minds.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.800
All right, Scrooge. Done and done.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.427
Very good, gentlemen.

10:36.635 --> 10:39.680
Now make sure that the draw
for this transaction...

10:39.889 --> 10:41.515
...is deposited with my clerk.

10:41.766 --> 10:46.645
I don't ship until I have the cash
in hand. Good day.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.692
- Mr. Scrooge, I presume?
- Indeed you do, sir.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.361
- You don't know us.
- Nor do I wish to.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.489
My name is Poole,
and this is Mr. Hacking.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.659
- Excellent. Now allow me to pass.
- Let me explain.

11:01.243 --> 11:04.622
At this festive season of the year,
it seems desirable...

11:04.830 --> 11:08.208
...that those of us with means
should make some provision...

11:08.459 --> 11:12.504
...for the poor and destitute
who suffer greatly at this time.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.007
Are you seeking money from me?

11:15.466 --> 11:18.135
Thousands are in want
of common necessaries...

11:18.343 --> 11:20.429
...and in want of common comforts.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.931
- Are there no prisons?
- Plenty of prisons.

11:23.724 --> 11:27.728
- Are the workhouses in operation?
I wish I could say no.

11:27.936 --> 11:29.605
The treadmill, the poorhouses...

11:29.813 --> 11:32.733
...still in full vigor?
- All very busy, sir.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.818
I was afraid from what you said...

11:35.027 --> 11:37.613
...that something had stopped them
in full force.

11:37.821 --> 11:40.490
A few of us are endeavoring
to raise a fund...

11:40.699 --> 11:43.493
...to buy the poor some meat, drink,
food and warmth.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.330
- What can we put you down for, sir?
- Nothing.

11:46.663 --> 11:49.416
- You wish to be anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

11:49.666 --> 11:52.586
Since you asked me what I wish,
that is my answer.

11:52.836 --> 11:55.088
I don't make merry myself
at Christmas...

11:55.297 --> 11:57.883
...and I can't afford
to make idle people merry.

11:58.133 --> 12:01.595
My taxes help to support
the public institutions.

12:01.803 --> 12:03.013
And they cost enough.

12:03.263 --> 12:05.432
Those who are badly off must go there.

12:05.932 --> 12:09.561
Many can't go there.
And many would rather die.

12:09.978 --> 12:13.815
Well, if they would rather die,
perhaps they had better do so...

12:14.024 --> 12:16.109
...and decrease
the surplus population.

12:16.359 --> 12:18.653
You don't mean that?
- With all my heart.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.156
Now if you will
go about your business...

12:21.364 --> 12:23.617
...and allow me to go about mine.
Good day.

12:49.475 --> 12:51.144
Father!

12:52.353 --> 12:53.980
Tim.

12:54.230 --> 12:55.982
You must be frozen.

12:56.232 --> 12:58.651
I'm all right now.

12:59.944 --> 13:03.906
Can we go home by Corn Hill and watch
the children play in the snow?

13:04.157 --> 13:06.159
Of course we can.

13:07.660 --> 13:10.580
Tim, I'm to have
the whole day off tomorrow.

13:10.830 --> 13:14.500
We'll be together,
the whole family for the entire day!

13:14.709 --> 13:18.588
Hurrah for Christmas,
the best day of the year!

13:34.478 --> 13:37.940
- Look.
- They're having such fun, Father.

13:41.986 --> 13:43.904
Go on, catch it.

13:44.488 --> 13:47.283
You'll be there one day, playing
with the other children.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.326
I'm sure I will.

13:49.577 --> 13:53.080
I feel I'm getting stronger every day.

13:58.169 --> 14:01.172
We must go home now.
Your mother will be waiting.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.841
Yes. It's time to go home.

14:51.263 --> 14:53.473
Scrooge.

14:53.890 --> 14:56.852
Ebenezer Scrooge.

14:58.228 --> 15:00.022
Who's calling me?

15:02.399 --> 15:04.401
Someone call my name?

15:06.862 --> 15:09.406
<i>Scrooge.</i>

15:48.945 --> 15:51.156
<i>Scrooge.</i>

15:53.825 --> 15:55.285
Scrooge.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.830
Marley?

18:39.656 --> 18:41.908
<i>Scrooge.</i>

18:59.050 --> 19:00.760
Humbug.

19:48.683 --> 19:50.935
It's humbug! I won't believe it!

20:12.498 --> 20:14.291
What do you want with me?

20:20.214 --> 20:21.799
Much.

20:22.549 --> 20:26.387
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.

20:27.221 --> 20:30.766
You are particular for a ghost.
Who are you then?

20:31.266 --> 20:35.187
In life, I was your partner,
Jacob Marley.

20:37.147 --> 20:40.025
- Well, can you sit down?
- I can.

20:40.275 --> 20:42.027
Well, do it then.

20:58.001 --> 21:01.004
You don't believe in me.

21:01.213 --> 21:02.673
I don't.

21:03.090 --> 21:06.093
What evidence would you have
of my reality...

21:06.343 --> 21:09.805
...beyond that of your own senses?
- I don't know.

21:10.055 --> 21:12.599
Why do you doubt your senses?

21:14.518 --> 21:19.356
Because a little thing affects them.
A slight disorder of the stomach.

21:19.981 --> 21:23.443
You might be a bit of bad beef
or a blot of mustard...

21:23.652 --> 21:26.029
...or a fragment
of an underdone potato.

21:26.571 --> 21:30.742
There's more of gravy than a grave
about you, whatever you are. Humbug!

21:36.122 --> 21:37.707
Mercy.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.044
Dreadful apparition.
Why do you trouble me?

21:41.294 --> 21:45.215
Man of the worldly mind,
do you believe in me or not?!

21:45.423 --> 21:46.675
I do! I must!

21:47.676 --> 21:50.929
But why do spirits walk the earth?
Why do you come to me?

21:51.221 --> 21:53.681
It is required of every man...

21:53.932 --> 21:56.935
...that the spirit within him
should walk abroad...

21:57.185 --> 22:01.064
...among his fellow men
and travel far and wide.

22:01.356 --> 22:04.234
And if that spirit
goes not forth in life...

22:04.484 --> 22:07.320
...it is condemned
to do so after death.

22:07.737 --> 22:10.490
It is doomed to wander
through the world...

22:10.740 --> 22:13.576
...and witness what it cannot share.

22:14.911 --> 22:16.704
What might have shared.

22:18.373 --> 22:21.709
And turn to happiness.

22:25.046 --> 22:27.215
You're chained. Tell me why?

22:27.465 --> 22:30.635
I wear the chain I forged in life.

22:31.219 --> 22:36.641
I made it link by link
and yard by yard.

22:38.351 --> 22:40.228
Is its pattern strange to you...

22:40.436 --> 22:42.855
...or would you know
the weight and length...

22:43.064 --> 22:45.191
...of the strong coil
you bear yourself?

22:45.816 --> 22:48.861
It was as full, as heavy...

22:49.111 --> 22:51.948
...and as long as this
seven Christmas Eves ago.

22:52.156 --> 22:55.826
You have labored on it since.
It is a ponderous chain!

22:58.329 --> 22:59.747
I see no chain.

22:59.997 --> 23:02.458
Mine were invisible...

23:02.708 --> 23:05.127
...until the day of my death...

23:05.378 --> 23:07.588
...as yours shall be.

23:08.547 --> 23:10.091
Jacob.

23:10.925 --> 23:14.887
Tell me more. Speak comfort to me.

23:15.137 --> 23:16.388
I have none to give.

23:18.432 --> 23:21.560
My spirit...

23:21.810 --> 23:25.314
...never walked
beyond our countinghouse.

23:25.522 --> 23:29.818
In life, my spirit never roved
beyond the narrow limits...

23:30.194 --> 23:33.072
...of our money-changing hole.

23:33.322 --> 23:36.492
No doubt of that.
You were a good man of business.

23:36.742 --> 23:38.077
Business?!

23:38.327 --> 23:41.663
Mankind was my business.

23:41.914 --> 23:44.750
The common welfare was my business.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.422
Charity, mercy, forbearance
and benevolence were all my business.

23:50.798 --> 23:54.009
The dealings of my trade
were but a drop of water...

23:54.259 --> 23:58.555
...in the comprehensive ocean
of my business!

23:58.764 --> 24:02.226
I'm sorry for you, Jacob.
Is there anything I can do for you?

24:02.851 --> 24:04.186
For me?

24:04.436 --> 24:08.148
Nay. It is too late.

24:08.398 --> 24:11.401
But I have come...

24:12.027 --> 24:14.654
...for your sake, Ebenezer.

24:14.905 --> 24:18.241
Have you?
Well, you always were a good friend.

24:20.327 --> 24:22.662
As part of my penance...

24:22.913 --> 24:27.459
...I have been sent to warn you.
- And so you have.

24:27.709 --> 24:33.089
And to offer you a hope and chance
of escaping my fate...

24:33.340 --> 24:36.009
...you will be haunted
by three spirits.

24:36.718 --> 24:41.222
Three spirits? Is that the chance
and hope you mention?

24:41.473 --> 24:42.307
It is.

24:43.391 --> 24:45.727
In that case, I think I'd rather not.

24:45.935 --> 24:49.272
Expect the first tonight...

24:49.522 --> 24:51.358
...when the bell tolls one.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.737
Couldn't they all come
at the same time and have it over?

24:56.321 --> 25:00.867
Expect the second
on the stroke of two.

25:01.117 --> 25:03.870
The third, more mercurial...

25:04.078 --> 25:07.707
...shall appear in his own good time.

25:13.254 --> 25:15.840
Look to me no more.

25:16.090 --> 25:19.177
Look that you may remember...

25:19.427 --> 25:23.139
...what has passed between us.

26:05.473 --> 26:07.141
Humbug.

26:31.832 --> 26:33.834
Something I ate.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.243
One.

27:11.288 --> 27:13.248
What was it Marley said?

27:17.961 --> 27:19.296
Nothing.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.926
Just a dream.

27:44.613 --> 27:47.866
Are you the spirit whose coming
was foretold to me?

27:48.533 --> 27:49.993
I am.

27:50.243 --> 27:51.745
Who and what are you?

27:51.995 --> 27:54.956
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

27:55.457 --> 27:58.835
- Long past?
- No. Your past.

28:00.754 --> 28:02.797
Perhaps you would do me the favor...

28:03.006 --> 28:06.634
...of placing upon your head that cap
that you hold in your hand.

28:06.968 --> 28:09.387
I bring the light of truth.

28:09.637 --> 28:13.057
Would you use this cap to put it out?

28:13.725 --> 28:17.061
I beg your pardon.
I had no intention of offending.

28:17.353 --> 28:19.564
What business brings you here?

28:21.441 --> 28:26.863
- It is for your welfare that I appear.
- I can think of no greater welfare

28:27.113 --> 28:29.782
than a night
of uninterrupted sleep.

28:29.991 --> 28:33.828
Be careful, Ebenezer Scrooge.
I speak of your reclamation.

28:36.164 --> 28:38.374
Well, if it's reclamation, then

28:38.624 --> 28:40.418
let's get on with it.

28:43.171 --> 28:44.797
Come.

28:50.970 --> 28:52.722
We shall be invisible

28:52.972 --> 28:55.433
and silent as the grave.

28:56.893 --> 29:00.855
You will now see a child, a youth.

29:01.606 --> 29:05.026
You will see yourself, Ebenezer.

29:08.112 --> 29:11.866
The air is so clean.
How different from the city.

29:12.575 --> 29:14.952
Do you know where you are?

29:15.202 --> 29:16.829
Of course, I...

29:17.079 --> 29:19.999
I was bred here.
I was a boy in this place.

29:20.291 --> 29:24.462
That's Daniel Costas.
And Robert Estes.

29:24.712 --> 29:26.714
Hello, Daniel.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.761
The big one there, that's David Tyler.

29:33.012 --> 29:35.764
David, look here! It's Ebenezer!

29:36.307 --> 29:39.852
I told you, Ebenezer.
They can't hear you.

29:40.060 --> 29:41.520
How happy they all seem.

29:41.729 --> 29:43.981
That's right. They do.

29:44.231 --> 29:46.734
Yes, well, it's time to move on.

29:46.942 --> 29:49.778
Come along, Ebenezer.
You know the way.

29:50.029 --> 29:53.407
I could walk it blindfolded.

29:56.493 --> 29:57.911
Your school.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.329
I remember.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.874
And it's Christmas Day.

30:02.124 --> 30:04.877
There's a boy in there, neglected.

30:05.085 --> 30:09.882
The boy is deserted
by his friends and his family.

30:10.340 --> 30:13.385
His mother is dead.
His father holds him a grudge.

30:13.844 --> 30:16.888
Why does his father
hold him a grudge?

30:17.139 --> 30:18.557
She died in childbirth.

30:19.182 --> 30:21.018
His birth.

30:21.268 --> 30:25.105
Weep for the boy,
if the tears will come.

30:25.522 --> 30:28.233
He has his friends, even on this day.

30:28.859 --> 30:30.736
All his beloved books.

30:31.486 --> 30:33.321
His Ali Baba.

30:33.572 --> 30:36.575
Dear old honest Ali Baba.

30:36.950 --> 30:40.370
The Sultan's groom,
turned upside down for Genie.

30:40.579 --> 30:44.624
But not a real child to talk to.
Not a living person.

30:45.167 --> 30:47.627
Robinson Crusoe, not real?

30:48.295 --> 30:50.672
And Friday? And the parrot...

30:50.922 --> 30:53.675
...with green body and yellow tail?
Not real?

30:55.218 --> 30:57.137
He made do, this boy.

30:57.387 --> 31:00.098
Let us see another Christmas Day

31:00.348 --> 31:01.850
when you were a youth.

31:03.810 --> 31:05.353
Fan.

31:08.898 --> 31:13.278
- Fan!
- Dear, dear brother!

31:16.072 --> 31:18.700
I've come to bring you home,
dear brother.

31:19.033 --> 31:20.785
To bring you home.

31:20.994 --> 31:22.662
Home.

31:26.749 --> 31:28.501
Home, little Fan?

31:28.751 --> 31:30.295
Yes.

31:30.545 --> 31:33.006
Home for good and all.

31:33.339 --> 31:36.259
Father's much kinder
than he used to be.

31:36.509 --> 31:38.761
He spoke to me so gently one night...

31:39.012 --> 31:42.390
...I was not afraid to ask once more
if you might come home.

31:42.598 --> 31:46.769
And he said yes, you should.
And sent me in a coach to bring you.

31:55.945 --> 31:58.656
You're quite a woman, little Fan.

31:58.906 --> 32:00.241
And you

32:00.491 --> 32:02.618
are to be a man now.

32:04.203 --> 32:06.789
And never come back here.

32:08.291 --> 32:10.418
Come. We mustn't keep Father waiting.

32:15.214 --> 32:16.590
Father!

32:16.966 --> 32:19.343
There, boy, down. Stand still now.

32:19.552 --> 32:20.803
Let me look at you.

32:21.512 --> 32:24.473
They haven't been overfeeding you,
that's certain.

32:25.474 --> 32:27.685
I've grown. I think.

32:27.935 --> 32:30.229
Yes, most boys do.

32:30.479 --> 32:33.816
- You know you won't move back here.
- Yes, sir.

32:34.024 --> 32:37.444
It's time you made your way.
I've arranged an apprenticeship.

32:37.695 --> 32:40.823
You'll move into Mr. Fezziwig's
in three days.

32:41.073 --> 32:42.324
Three days, Father?

32:42.533 --> 32:44.910
I'd hoped we'd have him home
for longer.

32:45.119 --> 32:46.412
Longer?

32:46.662 --> 32:49.999
Three days is quite long enough
for both of us.

32:50.249 --> 32:51.625
Don't you think, Ebenezer?

32:53.419 --> 32:54.962
Yes, sir.

32:56.005 --> 32:57.881
Quite long enough.

33:01.260 --> 33:04.304
- Finished back there?
- All safe and secure, sir.

33:04.513 --> 33:05.889
Into the carriage, Fan.

33:09.434 --> 33:11.019
Be on our way.

33:11.687 --> 33:13.939
Into the carriage, boy.

33:23.115 --> 33:24.366
Giddyap!

33:27.286 --> 33:31.081
Fan pleaded for more time,
but my father was a very...

33:31.331 --> 33:33.542
...stern man.

33:34.501 --> 33:37.629
- And Fan...
- She died a young woman.

33:37.879 --> 33:40.966
She had such a generous nature.
Yes, too young.

33:41.174 --> 33:44.886
- Old enough to bear a child.
- One son.

33:45.137 --> 33:47.806
- Fred, your nephew.
- Fred Holywell, yes.

33:48.014 --> 33:50.851
Who bears a strong resemblance
to your sister.

33:51.059 --> 33:54.437
Does he? I never noticed.

33:54.688 --> 33:56.273
You never noticed?

33:56.690 --> 33:59.859
<i>I think you've gone through life
with your eyes closed.</i>

34:00.110 --> 34:03.571
<i>Open them. Open them wide.</i>

34:09.244 --> 34:10.786
<i>You know this man.</i>

34:11.036 --> 34:13.581
<i>It's old Fezziwig.</i>

34:13.831 --> 34:15.458
Oh, yes, my dear.

34:15.708 --> 34:19.963
Would you ask Mr. Peuring to refer
that matter to Mr. Scrooge?

34:20.213 --> 34:21.755
Thank you, my dear.

34:22.005 --> 34:23.842
<i>And you know this place.</i>

34:24.092 --> 34:26.844
<i>Know it? Was I not apprenticed here?</i>

34:27.094 --> 34:29.054
Yoo-hoo!

34:29.304 --> 34:33.184
Pay attention, everybody!
Dick? Ebenezer? Pens down.

34:33.434 --> 34:37.146
No more work tonight, boys.
It is Christmas Eve.

34:37.397 --> 34:40.065
So close those ledgers down.

34:40.315 --> 34:43.110
Clear away in here, everybody.
We need the room.

34:44.654 --> 34:46.197
Here we go, lad.

34:46.447 --> 34:49.951
You'll enjoy yourself tonight,
Ebenezer. That is an order.

34:50.201 --> 34:52.786
- Yes, sir. I'll try.
- Put your heart in it.

34:52.995 --> 34:57.208
You put enough of yourself into your
work, and I have nothing but praise...

34:57.458 --> 34:59.085
...but you're young.

34:59.335 --> 35:03.965
There's more to life than
books of cloth and musty old ledgers.

35:07.843 --> 35:12.932
It's Mrs. Fezziwig and the
three daughters and their suitors.

35:13.182 --> 35:16.352
And a happy Christmas to you all!

35:16.602 --> 35:18.646
And Belle.

35:19.146 --> 35:20.815
I had forgotten...

35:21.065 --> 35:23.526
...how beautiful she was.

35:27.113 --> 35:28.739
Hello, Belle.

35:28.989 --> 35:30.241
Hello.

35:30.491 --> 35:32.827
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes.

36:07.861 --> 36:10.989
How long since you've danced,
Ebenezer?

36:12.324 --> 36:14.201
A waste of time, dancing.

36:14.451 --> 36:16.829
You didn't think so then.

36:17.037 --> 36:19.414
There was a reason then.

36:19.623 --> 36:23.794
You've changed since you've come
to Fezziwig's. You were so gloomy.

36:24.044 --> 36:28.632
I think I should warn you, Miss Belle.
I am of a serious bent of mind.

36:28.882 --> 36:32.094
I consider seriousness
an admirable trait of character.

36:32.344 --> 36:34.680
But it can be overdone.

36:34.930 --> 36:39.184
I shall take heed of your advice
and go through life with a grin.

36:56.409 --> 36:59.829
Come, you two! They're striking up
Sir Roger de Coverly.

37:00.080 --> 37:04.209
Time enough to sample the punch
when you're old and fat like me.

37:04.459 --> 37:08.838
I best partner my wife before that
young scamp goes dancing off with her.

37:09.089 --> 37:13.593
What a difference it makes, Ebenezer,
to travel the rough road of life...

37:13.843 --> 37:17.806
...with the right female
to help bear the burden.

37:18.056 --> 37:20.850
What a lucky man I am!

37:22.394 --> 37:24.813
Shall we join the others?

37:25.939 --> 37:28.149
My pleasure, Miss Belle.

37:49.003 --> 37:50.672
Old Fezziwig.

37:50.880 --> 37:53.383
A silly man.

37:54.092 --> 37:57.261
Silly? Why silly?

37:57.512 --> 38:01.390
What did he do to deserve the praises
of those apprentices?

38:01.766 --> 38:03.601
Spent a few pounds?

38:04.310 --> 38:05.603
Dance like a monkey?

38:05.978 --> 38:08.314
Beamed a great smile?

38:08.564 --> 38:13.110
Well, the happiness he gives... Gave...

38:13.319 --> 38:17.156
Was quite as great as though
it had cost 1000 pounds.

38:18.115 --> 38:20.826
Just small things.

38:25.539 --> 38:29.043
- Belle.
- Are you in love, Ebenezer?

38:32.838 --> 38:35.716
- The thought had occurred to me.
- She's too good for you.

38:35.966 --> 38:39.303
One day, when I've made my fortune...

38:39.553 --> 38:41.680
...then I'll deserve her.

38:41.931 --> 38:44.600
It was a night never to be forgotten.

38:44.850 --> 38:46.560
Never.

38:48.312 --> 38:51.357
<i>But you did forget. Often.
Huh?</i>

38:51.607 --> 38:54.985
<i>Look. Another Christmas Eve...</i>

38:55.236 --> 38:58.656
<i>...delayed by the pressure
of business.</i>

38:58.906 --> 39:01.408
<i>- Do you remember?
- No.</i>

39:06.497 --> 39:07.748
Hello, Belle.

39:07.998 --> 39:10.167
<i>Now do you remember?</i>

39:10.417 --> 39:12.127
I'm sorry I'm late.

39:12.377 --> 39:16.423
I thought you might not come.
I know how busy you are.

39:16.673 --> 39:18.258
Well...

39:20.719 --> 39:24.306
...the time of year,
and the nature of my business.

39:24.556 --> 39:28.185
It's important now that I use my time
and opportunities wisely.

39:28.435 --> 39:31.188
Another idol has displaced me.

39:31.438 --> 39:35.692
- What idol has displaced you?
- A golden one.

39:35.901 --> 39:40.197
All your hopes have merged
into a master passion: profit.

39:40.447 --> 39:42.240
The thought of money engrosses you.

39:43.658 --> 39:46.328
Perhaps I've become wiser.

39:46.578 --> 39:48.789
But I've not changed towards you.

39:49.790 --> 39:51.958
Our contract is an old one.

39:52.209 --> 39:56.630
It was made when we were young
and our prospects limited.

39:57.214 --> 40:00.383
How often I've thought of those times.

40:01.426 --> 40:03.762
If there had been
no understanding between us...

40:04.012 --> 40:06.723
...would you seek me out
and try to win me now?

40:07.307 --> 40:12.270
A dowerless girl with nothing but
myself to bring to a marriage?

40:14.272 --> 40:15.690
You have no answer?

40:18.860 --> 40:22.906
- You think I would not?
- Oh, what a safe and terrible answer.

40:23.740 --> 40:26.534
So characteristic of the careful man.

40:29.662 --> 40:31.873
Ebenezer, I release you.

40:33.208 --> 40:35.210
You are a free man.

40:35.793 --> 40:38.546
I let you go with a full heart.

40:39.172 --> 40:41.507
May you be happy
in the life you have chosen.

40:54.562 --> 40:57.106
I almost went after her.

40:57.357 --> 40:59.734
"Almost" carries no weight.

41:00.318 --> 41:02.695
Especially in matters of the heart.

41:03.362 --> 41:05.948
And you did have a heart, didn't you?

41:06.866 --> 41:09.827
Why didn't you follow her?

41:10.953 --> 41:12.872
Upon his death, my father...

41:13.122 --> 41:15.041
...left me a small inheritance.

41:15.291 --> 41:19.045
Belle wished to be married,
insisting we'd get by on very little.

41:19.295 --> 41:23.049
But I wanted something more
for both of us. So I...

41:23.299 --> 41:24.759
...lent out that money.

41:25.009 --> 41:29.680
Laid the foundations for financial
success, which I have achieved.

41:30.097 --> 41:33.351
- Congratulations.
- And I'll thank you not to sneer.

41:34.018 --> 41:38.481
- Show me no more. Conduct me home.
- You have explained what you gained.

41:38.731 --> 41:42.359
Now I will show you
what you have lost.

41:45.696 --> 41:49.116
<i>Belle.
Yes, Belle.</i>

41:49.408 --> 41:51.327
<i>And those are her children!</i>

41:51.535 --> 41:56.123
Oh, darling, he's wonderful!
Isn't he?

41:56.582 --> 41:59.251
<i>Oh, Lord, what a brood!</i>

42:09.970 --> 42:13.474
Hello, hello. Hello, my dear.

42:13.724 --> 42:17.394
Hello, Papa. Where's my present?
Where's my present?

42:17.644 --> 42:20.939
You will have to wait until tonight.
All of you.

42:21.148 --> 42:24.318
Presents on Christmas Eve, as usual.

42:25.486 --> 42:27.196
Fancy.

42:27.988 --> 42:29.323
They might've been mine.

42:29.531 --> 42:31.033
The same thought occurred to me.

42:31.241 --> 42:34.369
I saw an old friend of yours
in the city this afternoon.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.580
- Who was it?
- Guess.

42:36.788 --> 42:38.874
I can't.

42:39.249 --> 42:41.793
I don't know.

42:42.210 --> 42:45.297
- Ebenezer Scrooge?
- Mr. Scrooge it was.

42:45.839 --> 42:48.467
I passed his office window
and it was not shuttered.

42:48.717 --> 42:51.720
He had a single candle
lit upon his desk.

42:52.054 --> 42:55.474
His partner, Jacob Marley,
lies on the point of death.

42:55.724 --> 42:58.268
And there he sat.
Ebenezer Scrooge, alone.

42:58.477 --> 43:01.396
Quite alone in the world,
I do believe.

43:01.605 --> 43:03.690
Poor Ebenezer.

43:04.608 --> 43:06.276
Poor, wretched man.

43:06.526 --> 43:09.946
Spare me your pity!
I have no need of it!

43:10.155 --> 43:11.740
They can't hear you.

43:11.990 --> 43:16.870
And as for you, I've had enough
of your pictures from the past!

43:18.246 --> 43:19.748
Leave me!

43:19.956 --> 43:21.833
Haunt me no longer!

43:23.209 --> 43:25.795
<i>Truth lives!</i>

43:26.046 --> 43:28.923
<i>Truth lives!</i>

43:29.340 --> 43:32.260
<i>Truth lives!</i>

43:32.677 --> 43:35.388
<i>Truth lives!</i>

43:52.530 --> 43:54.574
A nightmare.

43:58.620 --> 44:01.039
A horrible nightmare.

44:05.334 --> 44:07.086
God...

44:08.504 --> 44:10.631
...let me sleep.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.721
Let me sleep in peace.

44:21.142 --> 44:22.935
Peace.

44:57.428 --> 44:59.013
Two.

45:02.224 --> 45:04.435
Well, Jacob Marley...

45:05.603 --> 45:09.231
...where is this spirit
of which you spoke so glibly?

45:11.191 --> 45:14.653
You did say at the stroke of two,
didn't you, Jacob?

45:19.700 --> 45:22.161
Mistaken in death...

45:22.995 --> 45:26.123
...as you were in life, old partner.

45:31.587 --> 45:34.464
Ebenezer Scrooge!

45:37.259 --> 45:39.511
Ebenezer Scrooge!

45:47.769 --> 45:49.479
Come in!

45:49.896 --> 45:52.190
I intend to.

46:02.409 --> 46:04.578
Come in and know me better, man!

46:11.585 --> 46:14.921
You've never seen
the likes of me before?

46:15.839 --> 46:18.341
That's quite true. I have not.

46:18.592 --> 46:20.677
You never walked forth...

46:20.927 --> 46:23.597
...with any of the
younger members of my family?

46:24.180 --> 46:25.807
Not that I remember.

46:26.057 --> 46:30.353
Nor any of my elder brothers
born these later years?

46:30.645 --> 46:33.481
No, I'm afraid not. No.

46:34.357 --> 46:36.735
Do you have many brothers, spirit?

46:39.404 --> 46:42.157
Over 1800!

46:45.326 --> 46:48.830
Tremendous family to provide for.

46:49.289 --> 46:52.250
Take hold of my robe, Ebenezer Scrooge.

47:18.109 --> 47:20.194
What day is it now?

47:20.570 --> 47:22.280
Don't you know?

47:23.030 --> 47:24.615
Christmas morning.

48:00.818 --> 48:03.571
There's a lot of buying, isn't there?

48:04.113 --> 48:07.741
Oh, Ebenezer, is that all you can see?

48:08.325 --> 48:11.412
Follow me, and I'll show you
to what good use...

48:11.662 --> 48:13.581
...these wares can be put.

48:13.789 --> 48:16.959
Does some peculiar power
emanate from your torch?

48:17.251 --> 48:18.794
Oh, yes...

48:19.003 --> 48:20.462
...there is.

48:33.559 --> 48:36.854
Do you know this house?
No, I can't say I do.

48:37.813 --> 48:40.107
It is the house of Bob Cratchit.

48:40.732 --> 48:43.735
Is it? He does very well
on 15 bob a week.

48:44.736 --> 48:46.363
Shall we go in?

48:47.281 --> 48:51.201
- I wouldn't want to disturb them.
- As with Christmas Past...

48:51.451 --> 48:54.663
...we shall be invisible and unheard.

48:56.957 --> 49:01.211
- I wonder what's keeping your father?
- Probably talking to the parson.

49:01.461 --> 49:04.506
Father always likes to compliment him
on his sermons.

49:04.715 --> 49:06.758
I hope the pudding's a success.

49:07.134 --> 49:10.470
No one makes a better pudding
than you, Mother.

49:10.679 --> 49:12.055
Peter?

49:12.431 --> 49:15.517
- Save some for the family.
- Just testing the cooking.

49:15.767 --> 49:18.645
I'm sure they'll manage very well
without your help.

49:18.854 --> 49:20.981
- Hello, Mother!
- Hello, Mother!

49:21.189 --> 49:24.484
- Smell the goose cooking, Martha!
- It makes my mouth water!

49:24.734 --> 49:27.445
- Mine too!
- I can't wait!

49:27.696 --> 49:31.491
You'll just have to. Run along
and help Martha butter the bread.

49:31.700 --> 49:32.993
Here they are!

49:36.705 --> 49:40.166
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
- You're late, Bob Cratchit.

49:40.417 --> 49:44.379
Oh, and you're quite like an icicle,
Tim. You've been dawdling.

49:44.629 --> 49:47.215
Father had a long talk
with the minister.

49:47.465 --> 49:48.758
Thought as much.

49:49.008 --> 49:51.719
Tim, listen to the pudding
hissing on the fire!

49:51.970 --> 49:54.722
It's like a giant snake
inside the copper!

49:54.973 --> 49:57.684
Go along with your brother and sister.

49:57.934 --> 49:59.519
Off you go then.

50:00.270 --> 50:01.604
Come on.

50:02.146 --> 50:05.900
- How did he behave in church?
- As good as gold.

50:06.109 --> 50:07.443
Better.

50:07.694 --> 50:10.071
Mama's worried how it will turn out.

50:10.321 --> 50:14.325
- Look how they support him.
- What did you say?

50:14.784 --> 50:16.828
Nothing. It's...

50:17.578 --> 50:18.621
...nothing.

50:18.871 --> 50:21.958
Somehow he gets thoughtful
sitting by himself so much.

50:22.208 --> 50:23.918
He thinks the strangest things.

50:24.293 --> 50:29.715
He said he hoped the people in church
saw him because he was a cripple...

50:30.174 --> 50:34.136
...and that it might be pleasant for
them to remember on Christmas Day...

50:34.345 --> 50:37.515
...who it was
that made lame beggars walk...

50:37.765 --> 50:39.976
...and blind men see.

50:41.018 --> 50:44.188
It seems to me that Tim
is getting stronger every day.

50:44.438 --> 50:49.151
That his limbs are growing. That he's
in better spirits, it seems to me.

50:49.360 --> 50:52.113
Yes, Bob. I'm sure you're right.

50:52.363 --> 50:54.156
He is getting stronger.

50:55.282 --> 50:58.327
Well, we're all here.
That's the important thing.

50:58.702 --> 51:02.289
- Belinda, help me with the goose.
Yes, Mother.

51:08.587 --> 51:12.508
Peter, I have some good news for you.

51:12.716 --> 51:16.053
I met by chance, this morning
at church, a fine gentleman.

51:16.303 --> 51:20.015
Fred Holywell by name.
He's a nephew of our own Mr. Scrooge.

51:20.266 --> 51:23.268
He remembered I have a son
coming of working age...

51:23.519 --> 51:27.940
...and told me he had a position at
three shillings and six pence weekly.

51:28.148 --> 51:31.235
Three shillings and six pence
every week?

51:31.694 --> 51:33.612
So if you are agreeable...

51:33.862 --> 51:36.198
...you may start work on Monday next.

51:36.448 --> 51:38.283
Now I can help you and Mother.

51:38.784 --> 51:40.369
More important...

51:40.619 --> 51:43.455
...you shall be embarking
on a fine career.

51:43.872 --> 51:47.960
To start a boy
at three and six pence a week.

51:48.544 --> 51:52.756
Typical of my nephew. No wonder he's
never been able to put by a penny.

51:52.965 --> 51:55.676
Perhaps he's "put by" more than money.

51:55.884 --> 51:57.344
Fred?

51:58.095 --> 52:00.597
He's doing this to spite me, you know?

52:00.847 --> 52:05.477
Employing the son of my employee
at an exorbitant wage.

52:06.603 --> 52:08.814
Come and get it!

52:11.108 --> 52:15.070
Quiet, quiet, quiet, children. Quiet.

52:16.279 --> 52:19.032
- A wonderful goose!
- It's enough for an army!

52:19.241 --> 52:22.160
- Mother, you've outdone yourself!
- It's all right then?

52:22.369 --> 52:25.288
Hurry, Father, cut the goose!
I can't wait!

52:26.748 --> 52:29.042
Haven't we forgotten something?

52:31.294 --> 52:34.881
Lord, we thank you for the bounty
you have placed before us.

52:35.090 --> 52:38.218
We thank you for this day
of love and joy...

52:38.426 --> 52:43.223
...for allowing us to be together, to
share with each other and with you...

52:43.473 --> 52:47.394
...the fullness of our hearts
on this special day.

52:47.644 --> 52:49.270
- Amen.
- Amen.

52:49.521 --> 52:51.022
Amen.

52:51.272 --> 52:53.399
- Amen.
- What?

52:53.942 --> 52:54.943
You say something?

52:56.778 --> 52:58.154
No, no.

52:58.446 --> 52:59.989
I thought I heard you...

53:00.240 --> 53:01.991
No, I said nothing.

53:03.451 --> 53:04.911
Oh.

53:06.871 --> 53:09.290
- Potato.
- Peter.

53:10.959 --> 53:12.835
Alice.

53:14.128 --> 53:16.798
- Belinda.
Potato, Alice?

53:17.173 --> 53:19.842
It's a very small goose.

53:20.093 --> 53:23.346
It's all Bob Cratchit can afford.

53:23.596 --> 53:24.847
Me.

53:25.848 --> 53:28.101
- Are we all served?
- Yes.

53:28.351 --> 53:30.603
Then let's begin.

53:30.812 --> 53:32.688
And a merry Christmas to us all.

53:32.939 --> 53:34.649
A merry Christmas to us all.

53:34.899 --> 53:38.402
And God bless us, everyone.

53:50.373 --> 53:52.249
Tell me, spirit.

53:53.167 --> 53:54.210
Will he live?

53:56.337 --> 53:59.173
I see a vacant place at this table.

53:59.548 --> 54:03.177
I see a crutch without an owner,
carefully preserved.

54:04.845 --> 54:07.389
If these shadows...

54:07.640 --> 54:11.143
...remain unaltered by the future,
the child will die.

54:11.352 --> 54:12.895
No.

54:14.104 --> 54:15.856
Say he will be spared.

54:16.106 --> 54:19.068
If these shadows remain
unaltered by the future...

54:19.318 --> 54:22.696
...none other of my species
will find him here.

54:22.905 --> 54:26.575
But if he is to die,
then let him die...

54:26.825 --> 54:29.745
...and decrease
the surplus population.

54:32.539 --> 54:35.626
You use my own words against me.

54:36.001 --> 54:40.547
Yes. So perhaps in the future
you will hold your tongue...

54:40.798 --> 54:44.468
...until you have discovered
what the surplus population is...

54:44.718 --> 54:47.513
...and where it is.

54:47.763 --> 54:50.057
It may be
that in the sight of heaven...

54:50.307 --> 54:53.769
...you are more worthless
and less fit to live...

54:54.019 --> 54:58.232
...than millions
like this poor man's child.

55:36.686 --> 55:39.439
A triumph, my dear. Another triumph!

55:42.150 --> 55:43.652
I told you so, Mother.

55:43.985 --> 55:46.029
It's a success.

55:46.279 --> 55:48.531
What a relief for Mrs. Cratchit.

55:49.199 --> 55:50.617
Now their feast is over.

55:50.867 --> 55:52.160
Not quite.

55:52.410 --> 55:55.914
Just one more ceremonious moment.

55:56.164 --> 55:57.582
Look.

56:06.799 --> 56:10.762
Now I would like to propose a toast
to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge...

56:11.012 --> 56:12.889
...the founder of our feast.

56:13.139 --> 56:14.682
Mr. Scrooge.

56:21.689 --> 56:23.858
The "founder of our feast" indeed.

56:24.233 --> 56:25.818
I wish I had him here.

56:26.069 --> 56:30.531
I'd give him a piece of my mind
and hope he had a good appetite for it.

56:30.823 --> 56:33.201
My dear, the children.
It's Christmas Day.

56:33.534 --> 56:37.413
It should be Christmas Day when one
drinks to the health of such...

56:37.622 --> 56:40.541
...a stingy, odious, mean...

56:40.792 --> 56:44.003
...hard, unfeeling man
as Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

56:44.253 --> 56:45.963
My dear, have some charity.

56:51.886 --> 56:53.262
Well, well.

56:56.265 --> 57:00.978
I'll drink his health for your
sake, and the day's sake...

57:01.187 --> 57:03.064
...but not for his.

57:04.607 --> 57:07.860
Long life, Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

57:08.110 --> 57:11.197
A merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.

57:11.405 --> 57:15.951
I have no doubt his Christmas will be
very merry, and he'll be very happy.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.536
Mr. Scrooge.

57:18.162 --> 57:19.413
Mr. Scrooge.

57:19.663 --> 57:20.915
Mr. Scrooge.

57:21.165 --> 57:22.791
Mr. Scrooge.

57:23.042 --> 57:24.418
Mr. Scrooge.

57:24.793 --> 57:26.629
Mr. Scrooge.

57:31.508 --> 57:34.386
He's made a point, Bob Cratchit has.

57:34.637 --> 57:38.140
Without me, there would be no feast.
No goose at all.

57:38.390 --> 57:41.518
My head for business
has furnished him employment.

57:41.769 --> 57:45.939
Is that all you've learned by
observing this family on Christmas Day?

57:46.190 --> 57:47.608
Well, no. Not all.

57:47.858 --> 57:52.070
But one must speak up for one's self,
for one's life.

57:53.447 --> 57:56.950
<i>Here we come a wassailing
Among the leaves so green</i>

57:57.201 --> 58:00.621
<i>Here we come a wandering
So fair to be seen</i>

58:00.829 --> 58:04.791
<i>Love and joy come to you
And a merry Christmas too</i>

58:05.042 --> 58:08.837
<i>And God bless you and send you
A happy New Year</i>

58:09.046 --> 58:11.256
We have some time left.

58:11.882 --> 58:13.133
Take my robe.

58:13.342 --> 58:17.304
<i>Love and joy come to you
And a merry Christmas too</i>

58:17.554 --> 58:21.516
<i>And God bless you and send you
A happy New Year</i>

58:32.319 --> 58:35.030
- Where are we now?
- Just a street.

58:35.238 --> 58:37.407
Any street.

58:37.824 --> 58:40.869
This house. We're going here.

58:42.037 --> 58:45.874
- I think it might amuse you.
- I am in no mood to be amused.

59:03.349 --> 59:07.187
Is my playing so amusing?
- I'm sorry, my love.

59:07.395 --> 59:11.107
I was thinking of his face yesterday.
Humbug, he said. Humbug.

59:11.357 --> 59:15.111
He said Christmas was a humbug.
He believed it too.

59:16.863 --> 59:21.159
I'd like to meet your uncle. The way
you portray him tickles my heart.

59:21.367 --> 59:22.410
He is comical.

59:22.660 --> 59:25.997
- But not pleasant.
- His offenses are their own punishment.

59:26.247 --> 59:28.708
Brother-in-law,
it's said he's very rich.

59:28.958 --> 59:31.753
That's true.
But his wealth is of no use to him.

59:31.961 --> 59:35.006
He does no good and
doesn't even make himself comfortable.

59:35.256 --> 59:37.633
I don't squander it,
if that's what you mean.

59:37.884 --> 59:41.763
You mustn't argue with those we visit.
It's useless and tactless.

59:42.013 --> 59:44.515
- Tact is a quality I despise.
- I can see.

59:44.724 --> 59:47.977
- I have no patience with him.
- I feel sorry for him.

59:48.186 --> 59:50.938
Sor...? Sorry for me?

59:51.189 --> 59:54.358
Who suffers from his ill whims?
Himself. Always.

59:54.609 --> 59:58.863
He takes it in his heart to dislike us
and not come and dine with us.

59:59.113 --> 01:00:01.157
And loses a very good dinner.

01:00:01.616 --> 01:00:03.743
The reason I talk about him so...

01:00:04.243 --> 01:00:07.621
...is that my mother,
God rest her saintly soul...

01:00:07.872 --> 01:00:10.791
...was very fond of him.
She loved him.

01:00:12.251 --> 01:00:13.711
It's true.

01:00:14.462 --> 01:00:16.797
Fan loved me and I her.

01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:20.843
Dear Fan.
I wish she were alive today.

01:00:21.093 --> 01:00:23.262
Fred looks very like her.

01:00:24.346 --> 01:00:25.639
Yes.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.978
I've been reminded of that
just recently.

01:00:31.812 --> 01:00:34.940
The consequences
of his taking a dislike to us...

01:00:35.149 --> 01:00:39.820
...and not making merry with us is
that he loses some pleasant moments...

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.239
...which could do him no harm.

01:00:43.157 --> 01:00:46.827
I'll give him the chance every year
whether he likes it or not.

01:00:47.036 --> 01:00:50.205
And every year he'll say, "Christmas!

01:00:50.456 --> 01:00:53.292
Bah, humbug!"

01:00:55.627 --> 01:00:57.880
Come, we must see to our guests.

01:00:58.964 --> 01:01:00.215
Nougats?

01:01:00.883 --> 01:01:02.718
So much noise.

01:01:02.968 --> 01:01:06.054
- I can't hear myself think.
- They seem to be happy.

01:01:06.305 --> 01:01:11.226
I suppose free food and drink is an
occasion for pleasure to most people.

01:01:11.643 --> 01:01:14.396
Happy in each other's company, I mean.

01:01:14.605 --> 01:01:19.026
Everyone, hush. We shall have
a word game. What shall it be?

01:01:20.068 --> 01:01:23.321
Simile.
Does everyone know the rules?

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:27.284
You each have five seconds to answer.
I'll ask the question.

01:01:27.492 --> 01:01:31.246
- Mr. Topper, you'll keep count.
- I shall do my best.

01:01:31.496 --> 01:01:36.293
You have five seconds. If you fail
to give an acceptable answer...

01:01:36.543 --> 01:01:38.795
...then you must
stand behind your chair.

01:01:39.045 --> 01:01:43.341
- Last one seated wins the prize.
- Fred, don't go on. Just begin.

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:46.386
I'm sorry, my love. Yes, I shall.

01:01:46.595 --> 01:01:48.555
And now...

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.391
Proud as...?

01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:53.602
Proud as a peacock.

01:01:55.687 --> 01:01:57.314
Peter? Dry as...?

01:01:57.564 --> 01:01:59.816
- As a bone.
- Good.

01:02:00.608 --> 01:02:02.986
- Plump as...?
- My wife!

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.573
Sorry, my dear. Just a little joke.

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:08.199
Plump as...

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:09.909
- One, two...
- Two seconds!

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.120
A partridge.

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:15.457
Quick as...?

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.627
- Wind?
- No!

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.504
One, two...

01:02:21.713 --> 01:02:23.590
...three, four...

01:02:23.798 --> 01:02:25.466
...five!

01:02:25.717 --> 01:02:28.052
- A wink, you idiot.
- Ebenezer, shh.

01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:31.848
- You said they couldn't see or hear us.
- That's quite true.

01:02:32.056 --> 01:02:34.058
Oh, yes. Sorry.

01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:39.439
Even I forget regulations sometimes.
After all, I do not come back often.

01:02:39.647 --> 01:02:41.899
I'm trying to listen to the game.

01:02:42.942 --> 01:02:44.694
Modest as...?

01:02:44.944 --> 01:02:46.779
- A maiden.
- No.

01:02:46.988 --> 01:02:51.325
- I'm sure it's a well-known simile.
- I was thinking of modest as a violet.

01:02:52.285 --> 01:02:54.036
Fred.

01:02:54.412 --> 01:02:56.747
However, I will accept your answer.

01:02:57.331 --> 01:02:59.041
Janet?

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:02.628
Attend. Tight as...?

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:04.797
Tight as...

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.800
A drum. Anyone knows that.

01:03:08.676 --> 01:03:09.677
Tight as...?

01:03:10.303 --> 01:03:12.722
Not very bright, my nephew's wife.

01:03:12.972 --> 01:03:15.933
Tight as your Uncle Scrooge's
purse strings!

01:03:17.435 --> 01:03:20.354
That's quite wrong.
And your time is up.

01:03:20.604 --> 01:03:23.232
You've lost and must stand
behind your chair.

01:03:24.316 --> 01:03:26.777
Tight as a drum
is what I was thinking of.

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:30.364
Good for you, Fred.
Boy's got a head on his shoulders.

01:03:30.614 --> 01:03:32.616
As for the laughter at my expense...

01:03:32.867 --> 01:03:35.786
...I'll overlook it
in view of the general gaiety.

01:03:36.036 --> 01:03:38.706
It's time to leave
this pleasant scene.

01:03:38.956 --> 01:03:42.334
We have one more visit to make
before my time is done.

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:44.295
Take hold of my robe.

01:03:44.503 --> 01:03:46.672
Sly as...?
A fox!

01:03:46.922 --> 01:03:49.300
- Red as...?
- Red as a rose.

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:51.385
- Silent as...?
The night.

01:03:51.593 --> 01:03:52.636
- No!
- A mouse!

01:03:52.845 --> 01:03:54.638
- Not at all.
- I know. The grave.

01:03:57.558 --> 01:03:59.309
Where are we now?

01:04:00.185 --> 01:04:01.728
I'm sure I don't know this place.

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:06.859
The name would mean nothing to you.
It's a place...

01:04:07.067 --> 01:04:09.736
...like many in this world.

01:04:14.408 --> 01:04:17.661
- Do we have enough wood for the night?
- It'll last.

01:04:17.911 --> 01:04:20.998
At least there's one thing
still free in this country.

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.878
Mary, a piece of that cooked.

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:30.173
- They're too hot.
- It'll be cold soon enough.

01:04:30.382 --> 01:04:33.760
- Where did you get these, Father?
- I didn't steal them.

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:35.387
She didn't say you did.

01:04:35.595 --> 01:04:38.932
- She should have some respect.
- Don't berate the girl.

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.352
They fell from a cart into the road.

01:04:42.602 --> 01:04:45.188
Your father's not a thief, girl.

01:04:45.939 --> 01:04:47.274
Not yet.

01:04:55.824 --> 01:04:58.118
Why are these people out here?

01:04:59.828 --> 01:05:02.706
Men and women in rags.
Children eating scraps!

01:05:02.914 --> 01:05:05.417
There are institutions.

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:09.170
Have you visited any of them,
these institutions you speak of?

01:05:09.379 --> 01:05:12.590
No! I'm taxed for them.
Isn't that enough?

01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:14.092
Is it?

01:05:19.222 --> 01:05:22.934
- Ben, come back to the fire.
- Look at these hands.

01:05:23.143 --> 01:05:25.895
They're hard hands.
They've done hard work.

01:05:26.145 --> 01:05:27.522
I want to work.

01:05:27.772 --> 01:05:32.110
I want to have bread for my children.
It's not right that there's no work.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.280
We're together.
That's the important thing.

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:38.491
I love you, Meg. I love the children.

01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:41.577
Tomorrow take the children
to the parish poor house.

01:05:41.828 --> 01:05:43.830
No. No.

01:05:44.247 --> 01:05:48.793
I'd rather we all drowned in the river
than go there and be separated forever.

01:05:49.043 --> 01:05:51.295
- Until I get work!
- No.

01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:55.466
Ben, we're a family.
We stay together.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.635
Come.

01:05:57.885 --> 01:06:00.263
Come back to the fire. Come.

01:06:13.693 --> 01:06:16.862
Why do you show me this?
What has it to do with me?

01:06:17.113 --> 01:06:19.240
Are they not of the human race?

01:06:20.449 --> 01:06:22.076
Look here...

01:06:22.284 --> 01:06:24.453
...beneath my robe!

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:30.626
Look upon these!

01:06:36.841 --> 01:06:38.259
What are they?

01:06:38.467 --> 01:06:40.511
They are your children.

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:45.224
They are the children of all
who walk the earth unseen.

01:06:45.599 --> 01:06:47.476
Their names are ignorance...

01:06:47.726 --> 01:06:49.061
...and want.

01:06:49.311 --> 01:06:51.563
Beware of them.

01:06:52.272 --> 01:06:54.900
For upon their brow
is written the word...

01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:56.402
..."doom. "

01:06:58.404 --> 01:07:00.989
They spell the downfall of you...

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.867
...and all who deny their existence.

01:07:05.035 --> 01:07:07.788
Have they no refuge? No resource?

01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:11.792
Are there no workhouses?

01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:14.253
Are there no prisons?

01:07:21.969 --> 01:07:24.930
Cover them.
I do not wish to see them.

01:07:25.138 --> 01:07:27.432
I thought as much.

01:07:29.893 --> 01:07:31.603
They're hidden.

01:07:33.063 --> 01:07:34.106
But they live.

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:37.442
Oh, they live.

01:07:39.736 --> 01:07:41.196
Well...

01:07:42.489 --> 01:07:46.201
...time has come for me to leave you,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

01:07:46.409 --> 01:07:48.537
Leave me? Leave me here?

01:07:48.995 --> 01:07:50.580
Oh, yes.

01:07:51.832 --> 01:07:55.126
Well, you cannot.
Take me back to my bed.

01:07:57.671 --> 01:07:58.922
It's too late.

01:08:00.507 --> 01:08:04.135
It's cold. The place is strange.
Don't leave me.

01:08:11.267 --> 01:08:12.894
Spirit?

01:08:15.688 --> 01:08:17.482
Come back.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:20.819
I wish to talk!

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.536
Perhaps...

01:08:29.786 --> 01:08:33.122
...I have made a mistake
here and there.

01:08:34.332 --> 01:08:37.710
Talked too quickly about matters
which I gave no great thought.

01:08:37.961 --> 01:08:40.171
Very well, we'll have a give and take.

01:08:40.421 --> 01:08:43.716
Come to some meeting of the minds.

01:08:44.133 --> 01:08:46.636
I'm a reasonable man.

01:08:46.928 --> 01:08:48.429
Spirit!

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:53.725
Have pity on me.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.897
Don't leave me.

01:09:08.491 --> 01:09:10.408
What have I done?

01:09:12.495 --> 01:09:15.206
To be abandoned like this?

01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:17.917
What?

01:09:21.671 --> 01:09:23.130
What?

01:09:56.914 --> 01:10:00.501
Are you the spirit which Jacob Marley
foretold would visit me?

01:10:07.174 --> 01:10:10.552
I'm in the presence of the Ghost
of Christmas Yet to Come?

01:10:18.268 --> 01:10:22.231
You'll show me the shadows
of the things that haven't happened...

01:10:22.648 --> 01:10:27.152
...but will happen in the time
before us. Is that so?

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.702
I fear you.

01:10:37.245 --> 01:10:39.289
More than any specter I've seen.

01:10:44.252 --> 01:10:46.129
I'm prepared to bear your company.

01:10:46.755 --> 01:10:48.840
Will you not speak to me?

01:10:49.883 --> 01:10:52.094
Very well, lead on.

01:10:52.677 --> 01:10:56.139
The night is waning fast.
Time is precious to me.

01:11:17.327 --> 01:11:22.499
I know this place very well. The
Exchange is like a second home to me.

01:11:35.011 --> 01:11:38.056
I don't know much about it.
I only know he's dead.

01:11:38.264 --> 01:11:39.307
When did he die?

01:11:39.557 --> 01:11:40.391
Last night.

01:11:40.642 --> 01:11:41.726
What about his money?

01:11:41.976 --> 01:11:45.772
Left it to his company, perhaps?
Who else did he have?

01:11:47.106 --> 01:11:51.527
It'll likely be a small funeral
if we volunteered and form a party.

01:11:51.778 --> 01:11:53.321
I'll go if lunch is provided.

01:11:53.571 --> 01:11:57.450
But I insist on being fed
for the time I'll waste.

01:11:58.451 --> 01:12:01.621
Have these men
no respect for the dead?

01:12:01.829 --> 01:12:03.331
I should go, I suppose.

01:12:03.581 --> 01:12:06.417
After all, we did considerable
business together.

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:10.004
Well, I must go and find
the price of corn. Goodbye.

01:12:10.254 --> 01:12:12.465
Goodbye.

01:12:12.882 --> 01:12:15.801
Why was I privy to their conversation?

01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:18.721
What purpose could it have for me?

01:12:41.869 --> 01:12:44.580
Merciful heavens, what is this?

01:12:48.834 --> 01:12:50.419
Spirit.

01:12:52.129 --> 01:12:54.423
This is a fearful place.
I wish to leave.

01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:14.109
No, I will not.

01:13:14.359 --> 01:13:15.778
This you can't make me do.

01:13:16.028 --> 01:13:18.572
I say, I understand.
That is sufficient.

01:13:18.822 --> 01:13:23.827
There must be someone who feels
some emotion for this man's death.

01:13:24.077 --> 01:13:26.288
I demand to see that person!

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:36.298
This is a foul part of town.
You've made a mistake.

01:13:36.506 --> 01:13:38.800
Taken a wrong turn.

01:14:04.451 --> 01:14:05.911
In there?

01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:08.371
I have no business
to transact in there.

01:14:24.012 --> 01:14:25.972
Open it up, Mrs. Dilber.

01:14:26.222 --> 01:14:29.267
Am I to pay you for goods
I haven't seen?

01:14:30.143 --> 01:14:32.937
You'll not ask me how I came by these?

01:14:33.188 --> 01:14:36.983
Every person has a right
to take care of himself.

01:14:37.233 --> 01:14:38.693
That's my motto.

01:14:38.943 --> 01:14:40.778
- Well, he was dead.
- Yes.

01:14:41.029 --> 01:14:44.282
And who's the worst
for the loss of a few things?

01:14:44.532 --> 01:14:47.201
- Not a dead man, I suppose.
- No, indeed.

01:14:47.452 --> 01:14:52.540
If he wanted to keep them after
he was dead, the wicked old screw...

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:56.252
...why wasn't he more natural
in his lifetime?

01:14:58.004 --> 01:15:03.217
He'd have had someone to look after
him when he was struck with death...

01:15:03.843 --> 01:15:07.346
...instead of lying there
gasping out his last.

01:15:07.597 --> 01:15:08.598
Alone.

01:15:10.099 --> 01:15:12.226
By himself.

01:15:23.404 --> 01:15:25.364
Those are my things.

01:15:25.865 --> 01:15:29.243
She's stolen my things.
I'll have her before a magistrate.

01:15:30.036 --> 01:15:31.037
What do you call these?

01:15:31.287 --> 01:15:32.288
Bed curtains.

01:15:32.538 --> 01:15:37.793
You took them down?
Rings and all, with him lying there?

01:15:38.044 --> 01:15:39.003
Why not?

01:15:45.593 --> 01:15:48.763
- And don't get wax on his blankets.
- His blankets?

01:15:49.013 --> 01:15:51.849
I hope he didn't die
of anything catching.

01:15:52.099 --> 01:15:55.895
I wasn't so fond of him
as I'd loiter about if he did.

01:16:06.739 --> 01:16:08.198
What's your offer then?

01:16:18.792 --> 01:16:20.836
Those are not my things.

01:16:21.712 --> 01:16:24.089
Yes, they are similar...

01:16:24.339 --> 01:16:27.593
...but the person she speaks of
could not be me.

01:16:27.843 --> 01:16:29.887
A similarity perhaps, but...

01:16:33.098 --> 01:16:37.644
One pound five and three. Not a penny
more if I was to be boiled for it.

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:42.608
You're hardened, Joe.
And no mistake.

01:16:42.816 --> 01:16:47.654
I'm always kind to the ladies.
That's the way I ruin myself.

01:16:49.364 --> 01:16:53.785
Spirit, what perversity is this?

01:16:54.244 --> 01:16:56.913
I ask to see some emotion
for this man's death...

01:16:57.164 --> 01:17:00.041
...and you show me only
greed and avarice!

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:04.629
Let me see some tenderness!
Some depth of feeling!

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:27.986
There must be some confusion.

01:17:28.194 --> 01:17:31.948
Your fellow spirit
brought me here earlier.

01:17:34.075 --> 01:17:35.493
Very well.

01:17:37.245 --> 01:17:40.707
You're devilishly hard
to have a conversation with.

01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:45.461
"Suffer the little children to come
unto me, and forbid them not.

01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:48.006
For such is the Kingdom of God.

01:17:48.256 --> 01:17:50.300
Verily I say unto you...

01:17:50.508 --> 01:17:54.888
...whosoever shall not receive the
Kingdom of God as a little child...

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:57.223
...he shall not enter therein. "

01:17:59.142 --> 01:18:00.643
This color hurts my eyes.

01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:08.026
It's better now.

01:18:10.695 --> 01:18:12.822
This work makes my eyes red.

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:16.784
I wouldn't show red eyes
to your father when he comes home.

01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:19.704
Not for the world.

01:18:20.746 --> 01:18:21.873
It must be nearly his time.

01:18:22.582 --> 01:18:24.208
Past it rather.

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:28.880
I think he walks slower than he
used to these last few evenings.

01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:31.716
Yet I've seen him walk home with...

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:37.596
...with Tiny Tim on his shoulders
very fast.

01:18:37.805 --> 01:18:39.223
And so have I.

01:18:39.432 --> 01:18:40.349
And so have I.

01:18:40.599 --> 01:18:41.684
And so have I.

01:18:41.892 --> 01:18:44.103
But he was very light to carry.

01:18:44.562 --> 01:18:47.231
And your father loved him so that...

01:18:48.733 --> 01:18:49.942
...it was no trouble.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.156
No trouble.

01:18:56.365 --> 01:18:57.741
There is your father now.

01:18:58.242 --> 01:19:00.786
Hello, Father.

01:19:08.335 --> 01:19:10.170
Hello, my dear.

01:19:13.173 --> 01:19:17.261
- Hello, my dear ones.
- Hello, Father.

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:20.389
You're late. We were worried.

01:19:20.597 --> 01:19:23.934
- I'm glad you're home, Father.
- I am too.

01:19:24.977 --> 01:19:28.313
You've become quite a little armful.

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:33.444
The reason that I'm late is because
I walked by there today.

01:19:34.403 --> 01:19:35.904
Today?

01:19:37.781 --> 01:19:39.575
I couldn't keep away.

01:19:40.617 --> 01:19:43.120
It's so quiet and green.

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.164
You shall see it on Sunday.

01:19:46.415 --> 01:19:48.542
We shall all go on Sunday.

01:19:49.793 --> 01:19:54.172
I promised him that every Sunday
I would walk...

01:19:57.384 --> 01:19:59.594
My little child.

01:20:00.721 --> 01:20:03.223
My little, little child.

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:05.475
Father, please don't grieve so.

01:20:07.144 --> 01:20:08.437
I'm sorry.

01:20:08.645 --> 01:20:10.105
I have all of you.

01:20:11.148 --> 01:20:13.400
A blessing to be thankful for.

01:20:16.987 --> 01:20:20.323
Do you know who I saw
in the street today?

01:20:20.574 --> 01:20:23.368
Mr. Scrooge's nephew, Fred.

01:20:23.577 --> 01:20:27.372
And he greeted me
in his usual cheerful way.

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:30.583
And he saw that I was a little sad.

01:20:30.834 --> 01:20:35.463
He asked me what was distressing me.
And when I told him...

01:20:35.672 --> 01:20:40.719
...he said that he was
heartily sorry for it, and...

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.222
Robert.

01:20:46.683 --> 01:20:48.852
Timmy's part of all of us.

01:20:49.727 --> 01:20:52.772
But for his sake,
we must go on living.

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:57.986
So long as we love one another,
he will always be alive.

01:20:58.945 --> 01:21:00.530
Yes, of course, my dear.

01:21:00.738 --> 01:21:04.284
But however and whenever...

01:21:04.742 --> 01:21:07.787
...we're parted from one another...

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:11.541
...I'm sure that none of us will
forget poor Tiny Tim.

01:21:11.749 --> 01:21:13.626
No, never. Never.

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:18.131
And when we recollect how patient
he was, and how mild...

01:21:18.381 --> 01:21:20.716
...although he was
but a little child...

01:21:20.967 --> 01:21:24.512
...I'm sure that we will not easily
quarrel among ourselves.

01:21:25.263 --> 01:21:28.641
I am a happy man.

01:21:29.892 --> 01:21:32.812
I am a truly happy man.

01:21:36.315 --> 01:21:39.694
I asked for tenderness
and depth of feeling.

01:21:40.611 --> 01:21:42.613
And you've shown me that.

01:21:45.116 --> 01:21:47.201
Nothing more I need to see.

01:21:50.121 --> 01:21:51.789
Take me home.

01:21:58.087 --> 01:21:59.922
What is this?

01:22:01.132 --> 01:22:04.301
I thought we agreed that you'd
transport me home?

01:22:10.933 --> 01:22:12.643
Specter.

01:22:13.894 --> 01:22:18.691
Something informs me that the moment
of our parting is at hand.

01:22:18.941 --> 01:22:21.402
I know it, but I know not how.

01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:23.904
Tell me.

01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:27.991
What man was that
who we saw lying dead?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.293
No.

01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:43.757
Before I draw near to that stone,
answer me this:

01:22:44.007 --> 01:22:48.303
Are the things you have shown me the
shadows of the things that will be?

01:22:49.388 --> 01:22:52.933
Or are they the shadows
of the things that may be only?

01:23:27.968 --> 01:23:33.056
Men's courses will foreshadow
certain ends. I accept that.

01:23:33.932 --> 01:23:36.726
But if those courses
be departed from...

01:23:36.977 --> 01:23:39.813
...the ends must change.

01:23:41.147 --> 01:23:43.692
Tell me that is so
by what you show me.

01:23:57.789 --> 01:24:00.667
Dear me, I am not the man I was.

01:24:01.376 --> 01:24:04.128
I will not be the man I was
before this visitation.

01:24:04.379 --> 01:24:07.382
Why show me this if I'm past all hope?

01:24:09.717 --> 01:24:11.552
Good spirit.

01:24:11.803 --> 01:24:15.056
Your nature intercedes for me
and pities me.

01:24:15.473 --> 01:24:19.268
Say that I may change these things
by an altered life.

01:24:21.145 --> 01:24:24.649
I'll honor Christmas in my heart
and keep it all the year.

01:24:24.857 --> 01:24:27.235
I'll live in the past,
present and future.

01:24:27.443 --> 01:24:29.904
The spirits of all
shall strive within me!

01:24:30.154 --> 01:24:33.199
I will not shut out
the lessons that they teach!

01:24:33.866 --> 01:24:35.493
Tell me.

01:24:37.328 --> 01:24:41.374
Tell me that I may sponge away
the writing on this stone!

01:24:43.292 --> 01:24:45.294
Spare me!

01:24:46.545 --> 01:24:48.422
Spare me!

01:24:52.677 --> 01:24:55.721
Spare me! Spare me!

01:25:04.188 --> 01:25:05.940
My own room.

01:25:08.734 --> 01:25:10.361
I'm alive.

01:25:13.614 --> 01:25:15.574
Thank you, spirits.

01:25:15.824 --> 01:25:18.202
I will keep my promise.

01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:20.996
I will live in the past,
present and future.

01:25:21.247 --> 01:25:25.042
The spirits of all three
will strive within me.

01:25:25.292 --> 01:25:29.505
Heaven and Christmastime
will be praised for this.

01:25:29.713 --> 01:25:32.966
I say this on my knees, Jacob Marley.

01:25:33.217 --> 01:25:35.135
On my knees.

01:26:05.248 --> 01:26:07.042
9:00.

01:26:08.752 --> 01:26:10.587
And daylight.

01:26:12.297 --> 01:26:14.758
But what day?

01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:19.763
Hello! You there, boy!

01:26:19.971 --> 01:26:20.847
Me, sir?

01:26:21.056 --> 01:26:23.517
Yes, you, my good fellow.
What day is today?

01:26:24.017 --> 01:26:26.728
Today? It's Christmas Day, of course!

01:26:27.145 --> 01:26:28.730
Christmas Day?

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:30.607
I haven't missed it.

01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:33.109
The spirits did it all in one night.

01:26:33.318 --> 01:26:35.820
Well, they can do anything they like.

01:26:36.029 --> 01:26:37.906
- Hello, my fine fellow!
- Hello!

01:26:38.114 --> 01:26:42.077
You know the poulterers in the next
street but on the corner?

01:26:42.285 --> 01:26:43.411
I should hope I did!

01:26:43.787 --> 01:26:45.622
Intelligent boy. Remarkable boy.

01:26:45.872 --> 01:26:49.334
Have they sold the prize turkey
that was hanging there?

01:26:49.667 --> 01:26:51.544
What? The one as big as me?

01:26:52.253 --> 01:26:55.006
Delightful boy.
A pleasure talking to him.

01:26:55.256 --> 01:26:56.800
Yes! The one as big as you!

01:26:57.008 --> 01:26:58.384
It's hanging there now.

01:26:58.635 --> 01:26:59.761
Well, go and buy it!

01:26:59.969 --> 01:27:03.765
And bring them around so that
I may tell them where to deliver it.

01:27:04.015 --> 01:27:06.935
Come back with the man
and I'll give you a shilling.

01:27:07.185 --> 01:27:11.147
Come back in less than five minutes,
I'll give you half a crown!

01:27:16.152 --> 01:27:18.196
I must dress. So much to do.

01:27:18.446 --> 01:27:20.448
I don't want to lose any time.

01:27:21.366 --> 01:27:23.993
I'm as light as a feather!

01:27:25.661 --> 01:27:28.373
I'm as happy as an angel.

01:27:28.873 --> 01:27:32.543
I'm as May as a school boy!

01:27:35.046 --> 01:27:37.965
I'm as giddy as a drunken man.

01:27:38.758 --> 01:27:41.427
Merry Christmas to everybody.

01:27:41.677 --> 01:27:46.098
And a happy New Year to the world!

01:27:51.979 --> 01:27:54.357
If this be a prank,
I'll box your ears.

01:27:54.607 --> 01:27:56.734
He was in that window. I swear it.

01:27:56.984 --> 01:27:59.028
Ah, there you are.

01:27:59.695 --> 01:28:02.365
This boy says you wish to
purchase this turkey.

01:28:02.573 --> 01:28:03.532
Yes, quite right.

01:28:03.783 --> 01:28:06.452
Your half-crown
for a service well rendered.

01:28:06.702 --> 01:28:08.621
- Thank you, sir!
- Splendid boy.

01:28:08.829 --> 01:28:12.374
Now, here's an address
and the price of the turkey.

01:28:12.583 --> 01:28:15.336
Take this fine bird
to Bob Cratchit in Camden.

01:28:15.586 --> 01:28:17.421
The directions are written down.

01:28:17.671 --> 01:28:19.465
- Leave immediately.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:19.673 --> 01:28:22.801
And you'll say only
that it comes from a friend.

01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:25.346
And it must be there in time for
Christmas dinner.

01:28:25.596 --> 01:28:27.181
It will be, sir.

01:28:28.098 --> 01:28:29.934
Here's something for your trouble.

01:28:30.142 --> 01:28:32.519
- Thank you, sir.
- Here, all for you.

01:28:32.770 --> 01:28:34.688
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

01:28:37.816 --> 01:28:39.902
Wonderful day.

01:28:45.407 --> 01:28:48.577
<i>So grant us all a change of heart</i>

01:28:48.952 --> 01:28:51.121
Good morning. Merry Christmas to you.

01:28:52.289 --> 01:28:54.625
Like angels. Yes, exactly.

01:28:54.875 --> 01:28:56.793
You sing excellently. Here.

01:28:57.044 --> 01:28:59.504
- Thank you, sir.
- It is I who thank you...

01:28:59.755 --> 01:29:03.884
...for that glorious music
on this glorious Christmas Day.

01:29:10.015 --> 01:29:11.391
Good morning.

01:29:12.434 --> 01:29:15.395
Oh, gentlemen.
Merry Christmas to you.

01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:18.273
Mr. Scrooge.

01:29:18.482 --> 01:29:20.776
I feel my name is not pleasant to you.

01:29:21.026 --> 01:29:26.072
I beg your pardons, and please accept
my pledge to the needy for...

01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:31.620
Lord, bless me!

01:29:32.537 --> 01:29:35.081
My dear, Mr. Scrooge!

01:29:35.332 --> 01:29:37.042
Are you quite serious?

01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:39.127
And not a farthing less.

01:29:39.377 --> 01:29:42.672
A great many back payments
are included, I assure you.

01:29:42.881 --> 01:29:44.799
What can I say to such generosity?

01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:46.051
Don't say anything.

01:29:46.301 --> 01:29:47.594
But, dear sir!

01:29:47.844 --> 01:29:49.804
- Will you come and see me?
- We will!

01:29:50.055 --> 01:29:51.890
- We will!
- I am very much obliged.

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:55.852
- Thank you 50 times!
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:30:03.485 --> 01:30:04.569
- Yes?
- Bob Cratchit?

01:30:04.778 --> 01:30:06.488
- Yes.
- This is for you.

01:30:06.738 --> 01:30:08.323
There must be some mistake.

01:30:08.573 --> 01:30:10.450
- You are Bob Cratchit?
- Yes.

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:11.910
There ain't no mistake.

01:30:12.118 --> 01:30:13.369
I didn't order this.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:17.624
This here prize turkey was
bought and paid for by a gentleman...

01:30:17.874 --> 01:30:21.586
...to be delivered to you
in time for Christmas dinner.

01:30:21.836 --> 01:30:23.296
What's the gentleman's name?

01:30:23.504 --> 01:30:24.422
Anonymous.

01:30:24.672 --> 01:30:27.133
He wishes to remain anonymous.

01:30:27.342 --> 01:30:28.551
Anonymous you said?

01:30:28.801 --> 01:30:31.304
That's what he said.
An anonymous gentleman.

01:30:31.554 --> 01:30:33.598
- Who could have sent it?
- No idea.

01:30:33.848 --> 01:30:35.892
- Is it a mistake?
- I thought so too.

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.769
It's got our name on it.

01:30:38.019 --> 01:30:41.105
- What shall we do?
- I say we cook it and eat it...

01:30:41.314 --> 01:30:44.859
...and have the best Christmas
feast we've ever had.

01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:49.822
And I say, Mrs. Cratchit,
what a splendid idea.

01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:54.410
And God bless us all, everyone.

01:30:54.619 --> 01:30:58.039
And God bless us all, everyone!

01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:06.088
- Merry Christmas, sir.
- Merry Christmas.

01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:08.382
Merry Christmas.

01:31:12.428 --> 01:31:15.139
Oh, Fred! It's much too expensive.

01:31:15.389 --> 01:31:16.807
But do you like it?

01:31:17.057 --> 01:31:18.809
Oh, I love it!

01:31:20.769 --> 01:31:24.023
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:31:24.231 --> 01:31:27.776
It belongs upon your wrist,
my darling. Merry Christmas.

01:31:28.027 --> 01:31:30.529
Oh, Fred! I do love you.

01:31:30.779 --> 01:31:32.573
- And not just for this.
- I know.

01:31:32.823 --> 01:31:34.241
I know.

01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:40.706
- Who can that be?
- No one's expected this early.

01:31:44.668 --> 01:31:45.794
My God!

01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:48.005
It's Uncle Ebenezer.

01:31:48.297 --> 01:31:50.090
Your uncle?

01:31:50.299 --> 01:31:51.842
What would he want?

01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:53.427
Open the door, Mary.

01:31:54.845 --> 01:31:56.555
I'm sure I don't know.

01:32:00.392 --> 01:32:01.226
Fred.

01:32:01.852 --> 01:32:03.270
Uncle Ebenezer.

01:32:05.564 --> 01:32:06.523
May I come in?

01:32:06.732 --> 01:32:08.108
Yes, come in.

01:32:08.317 --> 01:32:11.153
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:32:12.487 --> 01:32:14.072
Do come in.

01:32:16.199 --> 01:32:17.617
Good afternoon, madame.

01:32:17.826 --> 01:32:18.827
Merry Christmas.

01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:21.580
Merry Christmas to you.

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:25.751
Uncle Ebenezer,
this is my wife, Janet.

01:32:26.001 --> 01:32:28.462
Janet, this is Uncle Ebenezer.

01:32:29.254 --> 01:32:30.380
It's a pleasure.

01:32:31.173 --> 01:32:33.467
More like a surprise,
wouldn't you say?

01:32:33.675 --> 01:32:35.469
Well, that too.

01:32:35.719 --> 01:32:37.470
Well, that is quite true.

01:32:37.721 --> 01:32:39.764
Quite honestly, it is a surprise.

01:32:40.015 --> 01:32:43.059
When we spoke yesterday,
you made it quite clear...

01:32:43.268 --> 01:32:45.770
...that you wouldn't accept
my invitation.

01:32:45.979 --> 01:32:49.232
I made other things clear too,
didn't I, Fred?

01:32:49.482 --> 01:32:53.403
That Christmas was a humbug,
a waste of time and money.

01:32:53.653 --> 01:32:55.613
A false and commercial festival...

01:32:55.905 --> 01:32:58.074
...devoutly to be ignored.

01:32:58.283 --> 01:32:59.784
Yes, basically that was it.

01:33:00.827 --> 01:33:02.787
I've come for three reasons.

01:33:03.038 --> 01:33:06.207
First, to beg your pardon.

01:33:06.458 --> 01:33:08.460
For what I said about Christmas.

01:33:11.004 --> 01:33:13.590
That was a humbug, Fred.

01:33:15.049 --> 01:33:18.011
- Was it?
- I didn't know it then, but I do now.

01:33:18.761 --> 01:33:21.639
Secondly, I've come to meet your wife.

01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:23.766
- Well, here she is.
- Yes.

01:33:24.017 --> 01:33:26.936
And a very beautiful woman
she is too.

01:33:27.604 --> 01:33:29.355
Thank you.

01:33:31.399 --> 01:33:32.400
I, uh...

01:33:34.319 --> 01:33:35.862
I was in love once.

01:33:36.612 --> 01:33:37.905
Would you believe that?

01:33:38.114 --> 01:33:39.073
Yes.

01:33:39.323 --> 01:33:42.410
But I possessed neither the courage
nor the optimism...

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:47.290
...perhaps the depth of feeling
that you two have.

01:33:47.498 --> 01:33:51.169
Thirdly, if the invitation
to dine is still in force...

01:33:51.419 --> 01:33:52.420
...I accept.

01:33:52.628 --> 01:33:54.422
Of course it's still in force.

01:33:54.672 --> 01:33:56.257
Hurrah!

01:33:56.465 --> 01:33:58.050
I was sure that one day...

01:33:58.634 --> 01:34:01.470
You were sure?
Well, apparently you were right.

01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:03.973
Yes, I should like to dine with you.

01:34:04.682 --> 01:34:06.434
You'll be more than welcome.

01:34:08.728 --> 01:34:10.313
You like games, don't you?

01:34:10.563 --> 01:34:14.066
Yes, as a matter of fact I do.

01:34:14.316 --> 01:34:16.694
Do you ever play Similes?

01:34:16.902 --> 01:34:18.446
It's one of our favorites.

01:34:18.696 --> 01:34:21.157
- Perhaps we could play today.
- Quite possibly.

01:34:21.407 --> 01:34:22.533
I'm very good at it.

01:34:22.783 --> 01:34:26.495
And should the phrase
"tight as... " be thrown out...

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:29.415
...the answer is, a drum.

01:34:29.665 --> 01:34:31.500
Why, yes. So it is.

01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:33.377
Good.

01:34:37.631 --> 01:34:42.553
Forgive me for saying this, but I see
the shadow of my sister in your face.

01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:45.097
I loved your mother, Fred.

01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:50.394
For a time there,
I forgot just how much I loved her.

01:34:50.644 --> 01:34:52.771
Perhaps I chose to forget.

01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:55.691
Well, now.

01:34:55.899 --> 01:34:59.486
I should like to sample
some of that famous punch.

01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:03.824
Of course. You've made us both
very happy, Uncle Ebenezer.

01:35:04.032 --> 01:35:04.908
Have I?

01:35:05.159 --> 01:35:06.743
Yes.

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:10.914
God forgive me
for the time I've wasted.

01:35:35.313 --> 01:35:38.650
9:00. Late again, eh, Cratchit.

01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:41.361
We'll see about this.

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:19.524
Mr. Cratchit!

01:36:22.485 --> 01:36:24.112
Yes, sir.

01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:33.079
You know what time it is?

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:35.039
Yes, sir.

01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:37.166
What time is it?

01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:42.171
Eighteen past the hour, sir.

01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:44.757
Eighteen and a half past the hour.

01:36:45.007 --> 01:36:47.760
What do you mean coming here
at this time of day?

01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:50.847
I'm sorry, sir. I am behind my time.

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:53.558
Yes, I think you are.

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:56.477
Step this way, if you will, please?

01:36:56.727 --> 01:36:59.605
It's only once a year, sir.
It shall not be repeated.

01:36:59.856 --> 01:37:02.692
I was making rather merry yesterday.

01:37:03.818 --> 01:37:08.614
Well I'll tell you, my friend,
I won't stand for this any longer.

01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:12.493
Therefore...

01:37:12.702 --> 01:37:15.913
Therefore, I am going to...

01:37:17.748 --> 01:37:19.000
...double your salary!

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.588
Double my salary, sir?

01:37:25.714 --> 01:37:27.466
Yes, Bob!

01:37:32.221 --> 01:37:35.224
A merry Christmas to you!

01:37:36.559 --> 01:37:40.437
I'll double your salary and assist
your family in any way I can.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:43.148
And Tim? Tim will walk again.

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:46.610
And grow stronger and stronger.
Upon my life, he will.

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:52.199
We'll discuss the particulars
this afternoon over a Christmas bowl.

01:37:52.408 --> 01:37:54.243
What is the matter with you?

01:37:56.995 --> 01:37:58.789
Nothing, sir.

01:37:59.832 --> 01:38:01.500
Well, it's just that...

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.837
Nothing.

01:38:07.005 --> 01:38:09.842
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, my good fellow.

01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:13.595
Make up the fire
before we freeze to death.

01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:15.180
Buy some more coal...

01:38:17.307 --> 01:38:19.643
...before you dot another "I"!

01:38:21.311 --> 01:38:22.604
Yes, sir.

01:38:29.736 --> 01:38:32.823
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge
was better than his word.</i>

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:36.451
<i>He became as good a friend,
as good a master...</i>

01:38:36.702 --> 01:38:39.871
<i>...as good a man
as the old city knew.</i>

01:38:40.163 --> 01:38:45.293
<i>And to Tiny Tim, who did not die,
he was a second father.</i>

01:38:45.502 --> 01:38:49.464
<i>It was said of Ebenezer Scrooge
that he kept Christmas well.</i>

01:38:49.714 --> 01:38:52.384
<i>If any man alive
possessed the knowledge...</i>

01:38:52.634 --> 01:38:56.137
<i>...may that be truly said of us,
and all of us.</i>

01:38:56.346 --> 01:38:58.473
<i>And so as Tiny Tim observed:</i>

01:38:58.723 --> 01:39:02.394
<i>"God bless us, everyone!"</i>
