00:37.604 --> 00:40.095
Looking right at us.

00:40.173 --> 00:44.166
50 bucks says that's Lukesh.
100 says he knows we're here.

00:48.948 --> 00:52.645
- lt's him. Let's take him.
- Let him get to the mailbox.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.485
lt's Lukesh. l don't need him
opening a mailbox to prove it.

00:56.589 --> 00:59.023
Patience, Agent Doggett.

00:59.092 --> 01:03.995
We got an agent alone with a psycho,
a guy known for his vanishing act.

01:04.063 --> 01:08.000
We got the block surrounded.
He isn't vanishing anywhere.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.060
And your partner volunteered.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.203
Now...

01:17.343 --> 01:19.834
open 4-D.

01:21.514 --> 01:24.210
Agent Reyes, stand by.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.652
What the hell's this?

01:39.165 --> 01:43.192
- Monica, don't.
- Agent Reyes, keep your distance.

01:43.303 --> 01:45.703
Don't let him see you following.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.035
- Monica, where are you?
- Back stairwell.

02:22.108 --> 02:25.339
l've lost sight of him.
l think he might be...

02:42.262 --> 02:44.287
Oh, no.

02:45.231 --> 02:49.463
Agent down, back stairwell.
Get EMS here now.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.539
Doggett. He's got her gun.

02:56.809 --> 02:59.642
lrwin Lukesh. Federal agent.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.047
Turn around, you son of a bitch.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.390
Back here.

04:37.577 --> 04:40.808
- Hey.
- So this is how the uptown crowd lives?

04:40.880 --> 04:43.110
This is it. Movin' on up.

04:43.182 --> 04:46.811
So is there anything heavy
l can move for you? A dresser, a fridge?

04:46.886 --> 04:51.016
No. But thank you, John.
You just missed the movers.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.217
You don't say.

04:53.726 --> 04:56.820
l brought you a housewarming gift.

05:03.503 --> 05:07.735
- Hot dogs?
- Polish sausage. lt's the best in the city.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.038
There's a stand two blocks over on M Street.
You'll be able to walk to it.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.740
Try one.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.088
lt's like l'm back in Gdansk.

05:33.566 --> 05:37.366
- Let me get some plates.
- Plates? For cryin' out loud.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.429
Who eats Polish sausage with plates?

05:45.044 --> 05:46.102
Hello?

05:46.212 --> 05:49.704
- Agent Reyes, it's AD Skinner.
- Yes, sir.

05:49.782 --> 05:53.240
There's no easy way to say this.
Sorry to do it over the phone.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.412
- What is it?
- lt's Doggett.

05:55.488 --> 06:01.222
He's been found in an alley off Dylan Park.
He's been shot.

06:01.294 --> 06:05.424
- What did you say?
- They're taking him to Washington Memorial.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.423
Agent?

06:08.501 --> 06:11.163
What you're saying is...

06:13.840 --> 06:15.933
Agent Reyes?

06:17.276 --> 06:19.471
Agent Reyes?

06:28.855 --> 06:31.119
- Excuse me?
- Monica?

06:31.657 --> 06:36.151
- Brad? Skinner called you too?
- He's staying at the crime scene.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.287
l'm sorry.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.199
l've been put in charge of the investigation.

06:42.301 --> 06:47.329
l promise you, it's my top priority.
l will find the person who did this.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.773
l just need to find out
why your partner was in that alley.

06:50.843 --> 06:54.973
He wasn't. He was with me.

06:55.047 --> 06:59.279
At my apartment.
He was with me when Skinner called me.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.516
l'm not sure l'm following.

07:07.827 --> 07:09.658
Monica, l'm so sorry.

07:09.729 --> 07:13.995
Agent Doggett is just out of surgery.
They're moving him to the lCU.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.330
How's it look?

07:18.404 --> 07:21.168
lf he pulls through this...

07:22.575 --> 07:26.671
it's likely that he'll be paralyzed for life.

07:28.414 --> 07:34.353
l haven't understood one single word
l've heard since l got here.

07:34.420 --> 07:38.049
Whoever you're talking about,
it's not John Doggett.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.604
You found the bullet.

08:35.715 --> 08:39.650
9 millimeter slug.
Found it in the alley lodged in a wall.

08:39.751 --> 08:43.085
Most likely from a SlG-Sauer P226 or 228.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.783
Possibly FBl issue.

08:45.892 --> 08:49.419
This didn't come from Doggett's weapon.

08:49.495 --> 08:52.896
Ballistics don't match
and his gun was never fired.

08:52.965 --> 08:54.899
Assistant Director.

08:59.939 --> 09:03.272
l'd appreciate case updates
in a timely fashion.

09:03.342 --> 09:09.144
For instance, this bullet.
How long have you had it? An hour? Two?

09:11.784 --> 09:13.411
Thereabouts.

09:13.486 --> 09:18.617
lt's just that we need to keep the lines of
communication open. That's all l'm asking.

09:22.094 --> 09:27.293
l want this slug run through
our database of FBl-issue pistols.

09:27.366 --> 09:32.167
Like l told you, the round
didn't come from Doggett's weapon.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.865
You're not saying another agent did this?

09:34.974 --> 09:37.204
Just run it. Please.

09:55.461 --> 09:58.123
l just...

09:58.197 --> 10:01.826
l don't understand
how any of this is possible.

10:03.336 --> 10:09.172
He was with me, Dana.
ln my apartment. How can this be?

10:10.710 --> 10:13.008
l saw something once.

10:15.348 --> 10:20.411
lt's only been the last couple of years
that l've fully come to terms with it.

10:22.054 --> 10:25.182
ln '94, my father passed away.

10:26.359 --> 10:34.733
And that night, l think that very moment
that it happened, he came to me.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.930
l like to believe that he came to say goodbye.

10:42.008 --> 10:44.238
A visitation.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.709
l think that's wonderful.

10:48.781 --> 10:50.942
A blessing.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.848
But that's not what happened to me.

11:00.359 --> 11:01.383
Scully.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.428
lt's me. ls Reyes with you?

11:03.529 --> 11:06.157
She's here. We're still at the hospital.

11:06.232 --> 11:09.759
l need you to bring her
to the Sixth District police station.

11:09.835 --> 11:14.534
- What's this about?
- l'll tell you when you get there.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.947
What's going on?

11:32.058 --> 11:36.427
Agent Reyes, would you mind
stepping inside, please?

11:45.304 --> 11:48.330
Hi, Monica. Have a seat.

11:55.181 --> 11:58.912
l wanted you and l
to have a chance to talk alone,

11:58.984 --> 12:03.250
clear a few things up,
a few details of your story.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.051
My story?

12:05.124 --> 12:09.823
Your assertion that you were
with Agent Doggett when he was shot.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.454
- What is this?
- Just wait.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.523
- ls that a true statement?
- Yes.

12:16.368 --> 12:20.828
l mean, no, l wasn't with Agent Doggett
when he was shot,

12:20.940 --> 12:25.138
but l was with him at the time AD Skinner
called to tell me he'd been shot.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.509
Look, Monica...

12:29.048 --> 12:33.712
You know how l feel. You know l'm
on your side, but give me something here.

12:33.819 --> 12:39.052
Give me some mitigating reason
for what you're trying to cover up.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.650
l'm gonna put a stop to this.

12:43.829 --> 12:48.493
What are you saying to me, Brad?
Why are you saying these things?

12:53.873 --> 12:58.537
We've checked and rechecked
the ballistics tests.

12:58.644 --> 13:03.138
The bullet that hit Doggett
came from your gun.

13:04.150 --> 13:10.714
And furthermore, we have an eyewitness.
One who has placed you at the scene.

13:10.823 --> 13:15.760
ls that why l'm here? ln this room?
So you can make an lD?

13:16.729 --> 13:20.495
Agent Reyes, l have to ask you
for your FBl identification.

13:20.566 --> 13:24.195
Who's there? Who's back there?

13:27.072 --> 13:30.371
We appreciate your cooperation, sir.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.379
Anything l can do to help.

13:56.435 --> 14:00.872
Smart touch - posting a guard
to make sure l don't finish the job.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.278
Do you really believe l did this?

14:09.381 --> 14:13.613
No, but it doesn't matter what l believe.
You may still be arrested.

14:13.719 --> 14:17.951
- So what are they waiting for?
- Follmer's case has potential holes.

14:18.057 --> 14:23.620
For starters, when l called you, you were
at home, 14 miles from the crime scene.

14:23.729 --> 14:26.755
- Plus, the condition of your gun.
- lt hadn't been fired.

14:26.832 --> 14:30.768
However, the bullet does match your gun.
Perfectly.

14:31.937 --> 14:35.338
lt doesn't make any sense.
None of it.

14:36.308 --> 14:40.142
What about the eyewitness?
What can you tell me about him?

14:40.246 --> 14:43.477
You know we can't discuss that.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.011
Look.

14:51.757 --> 14:54.419
Oh, my God, John.

14:56.829 --> 15:00.162
- ls he conscious?
- l don't know.

15:00.266 --> 15:06.205
lt could just be a muscle spasm. lt's not
uncommon with this type of spinal injury.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.372
That's not a spasm.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.967
- What is it?
- lt's Morse code.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.557
What did he say?

15:30.462 --> 15:32.862
Lukesh.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.627
What? What does that mean?

15:57.589 --> 16:01.047
Who's there? ls somebody there?

16:02.828 --> 16:04.819
lrwin, is that you?

16:04.897 --> 16:08.890
- Who else would it be, Mama?
- l thought maybe robbers.

16:09.001 --> 16:13.734
l thought something terrible had
happened to you. You were gone so long.

16:13.839 --> 16:18.742
l was gone two hours and six minutes.
l'm back at noon, just like l told you.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.210
l was so scared.

16:21.280 --> 16:29.016
Could you bring me a glass of Clamato with
two squirts of Texas Pete and two ice cubes?

16:32.958 --> 16:37.952
God, l was all alone.
And l heard the knob rattle.

16:38.063 --> 16:44.195
Somebody was rattling the knob.
lt was the robbers, l just know it was.

16:44.269 --> 16:49.866
l don't know how l got through it.
l was so scared.

16:52.878 --> 16:57.872
Like sands through the hourglass,
so are the days of our lives.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.747
My show is on.

16:59.818 --> 17:05.983
Could you make my hot sandwich, so l can
eat my sandwich while l watch my show?

17:12.464 --> 17:14.728
What kind of sandwich is it?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.825
Potted meat.

17:16.935 --> 17:20.462
l don't think l like that.
Have l had it before?

17:20.571 --> 17:22.733
Many times.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.175
You love it.

17:32.518 --> 17:36.955
- l should be at the hospital.
- Scully will call if he regains consciousness.

17:37.022 --> 17:40.617
- Either way, l should be there.
- You're under investigation.

17:40.692 --> 17:44.992
Not to mention l will be too
if it's ever found out that l showed you this.

17:52.037 --> 17:54.267
lrwin Timothy Lukesh?

17:54.339 --> 17:57.206
Have you ever seen him before?

17:58.677 --> 18:02.670
''1995, patient at the State Psychiatric
Hospital at Gaithersburg.''

18:02.748 --> 18:09.278
''Diagnosed with a delusional disorder which
presented itself after his father's suicide.''

18:09.354 --> 18:13.984
After four months,
he was deemed fit for release.

18:14.059 --> 18:18.291
He lives with his invalid mother in
an apartment adjacent to the crime scene.

18:18.363 --> 18:22.129
- What's the story he's telling?
- That he heard a bang,

18:22.201 --> 18:27.229
went downstairs to investigate,
and then he saw you exit the alley.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.669
This is the one person we know
was in the vicinity of the shooting.

18:31.743 --> 18:34.837
Why would Doggett say his name?

18:34.913 --> 18:38.007
You think Lukesh shot Doggett?

18:38.083 --> 18:44.579
What if Doggett was investigating Lukesh?
What if Lukesh is somehow behind all this?

18:52.498 --> 18:53.522
Skinner.

18:53.599 --> 18:57.729
Do you recall our discussion
where l asked you to keep me up to date?

18:57.836 --> 18:59.269
l do.

18:59.371 --> 19:02.863
Really? lt's like we never even had it.

19:02.941 --> 19:07.537
l'm at Washington Memorial.
l'm assuming you're with our prime suspect.

19:07.613 --> 19:12.107
Bring her.
She's gonna talk to Agent Doggett.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.422
The gang's all here.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.286
- How is he?
- Fully conscious.

19:19.391 --> 19:23.293
We set up a communication device
designed for spinal-injury victims.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.522
Speaking with him should be easier.

19:25.597 --> 19:31.399
You'll ask only the questions l want asked.
You're not to try to shade his testimony.

19:31.470 --> 19:34.405
lf you're so concerned,
why let Reyes talk to him?

19:34.473 --> 19:39.706
Because he says
he won't talk to anyone but you.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.474
He didn't mention you two.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.801
John.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.580
Hey, there.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.765
That's right.

20:39.838 --> 20:42.204
You're alive.

20:42.307 --> 20:44.775
As if there were ever any doubt.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.222
Why am l alive? ls that what you're asking?

20:59.324 --> 21:02.122
l'm fine, John. Why wouldn't l be?

21:04.329 --> 21:06.524
Have him say who shot him.

21:33.558 --> 21:38.393
My throat wasn't cut, John.
What do you mean?

23:17.629 --> 23:20.826
Wiggle your finger if you feel anything.

23:20.932 --> 23:26.962
Any sensation at all.
Pain, tingling.

23:29.207 --> 23:30.606
OK.

23:30.675 --> 23:35.874
That's enough for today.
We'll see if you can do any better tomorrow.

23:47.492 --> 23:50.893
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

24:01.072 --> 24:03.404
lt's coming along.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.508
lt's nowhere, basically.

24:09.581 --> 24:13.711
There's so much
that's impossible to reconcile.

24:13.819 --> 24:19.382
You say l was on a stakeout with you. l say
you were at my apartment bringing me...

24:23.929 --> 24:26.557
John...

24:26.665 --> 24:33.195
do you know a little stand on M Street?
Supposed to be really good hot dogs?

24:43.682 --> 24:46.515
John, what if we were both right?

24:46.585 --> 24:52.717
What if you were at my apartment and l was
on a stakeout with you at the same time?

24:52.791 --> 24:56.192
What would it take for that to be true?

25:03.969 --> 25:08.235
Except maybe we do.
Maybe all of us do.

25:12.944 --> 25:16.243
You've heard of the idea
of a parallel universe.

25:16.314 --> 25:20.273
One that's identical,
or nearly identical, to our own.

25:20.385 --> 25:23.218
One in which we all have a double.

25:23.288 --> 25:27.452
lt's theoretical physics,
but what if it's real?

25:37.569 --> 25:42.734
You said yourself lrwin Lukesh
was known for his impossible escapes.

25:42.807 --> 25:48.143
You said that in the alley you looked away
only for an instant and he was gone.

25:53.418 --> 25:55.409
Back here.

25:55.487 --> 26:00.254
And then somehow he was
behind you and he shot you.

26:02.761 --> 26:08.131
With my gun - my gun that never left
my possession that entire afternoon.

26:09.200 --> 26:13.466
What if Lukesh can pass freely
from one parallel world to the other?

26:13.538 --> 26:17.338
Like he's opening a door.

26:21.880 --> 26:28.012
And what if somehow you followed him
through that door without even knowing it?

26:30.889 --> 26:35.553
Maybe when you followed Lukesh
into this world, my...

26:35.660 --> 26:39.187
my Doggett got forced out.

26:48.473 --> 26:54.673
My Doggett would've called that crazy too.
But give me another theory that fits.

27:02.887 --> 27:08.154
l'm kinda confused as to why l'm back.
l already told you everything l know.

27:08.827 --> 27:14.561
We just had a few little inconsistencies
that we needed to clear up.

27:15.533 --> 27:19.492
Sure. Dot the i's, cross the t's.

27:20.505 --> 27:23.406
Here's an odd one for starters.

27:24.242 --> 27:29.509
We have an eyewitness
that says you shot Agent John Doggett.

27:31.783 --> 27:35.378
That's surprising.
l can't imagine who would have said that.

27:35.453 --> 27:38.217
Agent Doggett.

27:38.289 --> 27:42.282
He's regained consciousness.
He's very chatty.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.989
Among other things,
he says that you're a murderer.

27:47.198 --> 27:50.565
That you enjoy killing women
with a straight razor.

27:50.635 --> 27:54.036
And cutting out their tongues.

27:56.908 --> 27:58.899
Yeah.

27:58.977 --> 28:00.968
Wow.

28:01.079 --> 28:03.741
What a corker.

28:04.616 --> 28:08.780
Mr Lukesh, would you consent to a GSR test?

28:09.421 --> 28:11.286
GSR? What is that?

28:11.389 --> 28:17.157
To reveal whether or not
someone recently fired a gun.

28:17.262 --> 28:20.754
You wouldn't mind indulging us, would you?

28:20.832 --> 28:25.428
l don't know. l think l'd have
to talk to my lawyer about that.

28:29.474 --> 28:34.377
Look, my heart goes out
to your Agent Doggett.

28:34.446 --> 28:37.176
But he's confused.

28:37.248 --> 28:43.050
lt's clear to me that your female agent
Ms Reyes is responsible for this tragedy.

28:43.121 --> 28:46.579
ls there someone
who can corroborate your story?

28:48.159 --> 28:49.626
No.

28:50.495 --> 28:52.929
What about your mother?

28:54.966 --> 28:56.763
You live with your mother?

28:56.835 --> 29:01.033
She was sleeping.
She wouldn't have heard anything.

29:01.139 --> 29:05.371
Maybe she can tell us something.
Would she be willing to come down here?

29:05.477 --> 29:08.935
My mother is in poor health.
She gets confused easily.

29:09.013 --> 29:10.708
We can go to her.

29:10.815 --> 29:16.685
l won't have you harassing herjust because
you won't admit one of your people did this.

29:17.288 --> 29:22.123
Now, if you're going to arrest me, do it.

29:25.463 --> 29:28.057
Otherwise l'm going home.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.833
Say hi to Mama.

29:58.763 --> 30:01.095
Agent Reyes, right?

30:03.401 --> 30:05.665
What's the matter?

30:06.604 --> 30:09.232
Cat got your tongue?

30:10.842 --> 30:14.005
How do you do it?

30:14.078 --> 30:17.844
You know what l'm talking about, don't you?

30:18.917 --> 30:25.846
There's this world, and there's the world
where you live out your sick fantasies.

30:25.924 --> 30:30.952
When did it start?
Was it after your breakdown in '95?

30:31.062 --> 30:38.059
All that anger. lt was buttoned up so tight
it had nowhere else to go.

30:38.136 --> 30:40.400
lt had to get released.

30:41.639 --> 30:46.269
Not here, but in a world just like this one.

30:53.418 --> 30:56.114
God, l enjoyed you.

30:58.122 --> 31:01.285
You bled just like a pig.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.626
Reyes?

31:17.242 --> 31:19.335
You all right?

31:29.187 --> 31:31.519
Mama, l'm home.

31:46.371 --> 31:49.101
Mama, you want your Clamato?

32:04.656 --> 32:06.556
Mama?

32:11.396 --> 32:13.796
Have you been out of bed?

32:18.569 --> 32:20.469
Mama?

32:28.179 --> 32:31.342
You don't tell me things, lrwin.

32:33.584 --> 32:35.848
l tell you things.

32:36.821 --> 32:39.881
You sneak out of the house all night.

32:39.991 --> 32:44.655
You leave me alone all by myself,
and then you think that l don't know?

32:44.729 --> 32:48.688
l know. l know every time.

32:49.434 --> 32:54.428
What is it that you do, lrwin,
that you don't tell me?

32:54.539 --> 32:58.999
l don't do that.
l don't know what you mean.

33:00.278 --> 33:03.042
Why is that in my house?

33:04.749 --> 33:09.118
l opened the drawer
and it gave me a heart attack.

33:09.220 --> 33:14.852
l don't even know how l even picked it up
without it going off and killing me.

33:14.926 --> 33:17.019
l was so scared.

33:19.430 --> 33:22.866
Mama, l don't know how it got there.

33:22.934 --> 33:28.065
lf you won't tell me,
you can tell the FBl. That's it.

33:29.140 --> 33:34.908
The FBl has left three messages.
They want to talk to me.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.908
Can you imagine, lrwin?

33:38.983 --> 33:43.579
Why would the FBl want to talk to me?

33:53.631 --> 33:57.897
What are you doing?
Aren't you even gonna listen?

34:00.805 --> 34:05.902
- Are you gonna talk to them?
- Of course l am. lt's the FBl.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.079
Mama...

34:14.518 --> 34:18.284
Don't turn on the waterworks.
lt's not going to wash.

34:18.356 --> 34:20.755
l'm the one who's being lied to.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.668
lrwin...

34:36.774 --> 34:39.139
What are you doing?

34:46.717 --> 34:49.379
lrwin, what are you doing?

34:50.154 --> 34:51.621
lrwin.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.519
Did not.

35:28.593 --> 35:33.030
Anyway, that's what you get
for hiring cheap help.

35:39.370 --> 35:41.361
Thinking about what?

36:06.564 --> 36:08.225
How?

36:19.710 --> 36:22.144
Bad joke.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.828
My theory is sound?

36:47.972 --> 36:52.636
You don't believe a word of it.
Never in a million years would you believe.

36:52.743 --> 36:56.304
This has nothing to do with my theory.

37:16.467 --> 37:20.335
l would do anything for you.
Anything but that.

37:29.780 --> 37:30.838
Reyes.

37:30.948 --> 37:35.112
- Skinner. Are you OK?
- Yes, sir, l'm fine.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.554
l can't say the same for Miriam Lukesh.

37:38.623 --> 37:42.115
- What happened?
- She's dead.

37:42.860 --> 37:47.456
lt's the exact MO Doggett described.
Most likely a straight razor was used.

37:48.332 --> 37:51.733
Lukesh killed his mother.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.862
- Do you have any idea where he is?
- None.

37:54.972 --> 37:58.669
But if everything l hear is true,
he won't be easy to find.

37:59.744 --> 38:02.440
l think he'll find us.

38:44.755 --> 38:50.091
- Are you all right, Agent Reyes?
- Just a little jumpy, l guess.

38:50.194 --> 38:52.560
That's understandable.

38:52.630 --> 38:54.757
l don't think you're the only one.

38:54.865 --> 38:58.357
Try and take it easy.
We got you covered comin' and goin'.

38:58.436 --> 39:00.597
Anything happening out front?

39:00.705 --> 39:04.266
No. You moved into a quiet neighborhood.
lt's dead out there.

39:06.944 --> 39:10.209
l think l'll check around once more.

39:34.939 --> 39:36.964
You wanna scream, don't you?

39:37.074 --> 39:42.478
To your friends outside. Parked in a van
that might as well say ''FBl'' in huge letters.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.445
ln red.

39:44.515 --> 39:48.246
Try and scream out to 'em.
They can't hear you.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.752
- Where'd she go?
- Monica, do you copy?

39:55.826 --> 39:59.091
Reyes? Agent Reyes, do you read me?

39:59.163 --> 40:02.963
- He's in there. He's gotta be.
- lt's not possible.

40:03.033 --> 40:07.800
What if it is?
You wanna stick around and find out?

40:08.439 --> 40:11.340
You ruined everything, you bitch.

40:13.811 --> 40:16.006
You made me.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.541
- You made me do it.
- Lukesh...

40:19.617 --> 40:22.051
Shut up. Shut up.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.286
But you know what?

40:29.493 --> 40:32.519
This time l get to bleed you slow.

40:41.472 --> 40:44.600
You all right?

40:44.675 --> 40:46.802
Monica, you all right?

40:50.014 --> 40:53.506
lt's OK. lt's OK. lt's over.

43:08.652 --> 43:11.780
Monica, forget about the plates, will ya?

43:15.392 --> 43:17.792
What's wrong?

43:27.972 --> 43:30.532
Monica, what's wrong?

43:31.642 --> 43:33.701
l'm good.

43:34.511 --> 43:36.445
Good.
