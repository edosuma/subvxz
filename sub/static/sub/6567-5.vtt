00:00.020 --> 00:02.812
Isn't that your father with
the crown prince of Paradise?

00:02.812 --> 00:04.449
He serves as
Lorenzo's notary.

00:05.821 --> 00:08.626
Stay away from the Medicis,
Leonardo.

00:08.628 --> 00:11.396
If you transfer your accounts
to the Pazzi Bank,

00:11.398 --> 00:14.369
away from the Medicis, you'll
have all the funds you need.

00:14.371 --> 00:15.640
(Gasps)

00:15.642 --> 00:17.811
Its bite is almost
never noticed.

00:17.813 --> 00:21.552
So no evidence implicating
Lorenzo's lover.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.321
May I model for you again?

00:23.323 --> 00:25.893
Go peddle your wares
with Botticelli. He's an easy mark.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.532
Interrogate the victim
mentioned here, Captain.

00:28.534 --> 00:31.705
Once he confirms the charges,
make your arrest.

00:31.707 --> 00:34.276
It has come to the attention
of the Officers of the Night,

00:34.278 --> 00:36.647
by means of
secret denunciation,

00:36.649 --> 00:38.617
Leonardo di ser
Piero da Vinci

00:38.619 --> 00:41.355
has committed
the grievous act of sodomy.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.080
Weren't no dream.
You're still here.

02:34.457 --> 02:38.095
He's sleeping like a baby,
I'm scared to turn over.

02:39.564 --> 02:41.366
(Bat squeaks)

02:42.134 --> 02:43.803
Bats.

02:46.573 --> 02:48.073
What is that place?

02:48.075 --> 02:52.677
Solitary confinement, where
we put the troublemakers.

02:52.679 --> 02:54.945
So behave yourself.

02:54.947 --> 02:56.714
The bats nest in there?

02:56.716 --> 03:00.384
By the hundreds.
It's a shit-hole.

03:00.386 --> 03:03.620
Then again,
maybe you'd like it.

03:03.622 --> 03:06.156
Where's your
Medici friend now?

03:15.832 --> 03:17.967
Your Highness.

03:17.969 --> 03:21.003
The beating heart
of our operation.

03:21.005 --> 03:24.573
Yes. With an impressively
large workforce.

03:24.575 --> 03:28.076
Let me see.
Three, five, seven...

03:28.078 --> 03:30.445
13... 27...

03:30.447 --> 03:32.481
Your Highness.

03:32.483 --> 03:35.784
Just testing the mettle
of your men.

03:35.786 --> 03:37.819
As I'm sure you're aware,
Queen Isabella and I

03:37.821 --> 03:39.754
don't offer our business
to just anyone.

03:39.756 --> 03:43.257
I can assure you not only
of the competency of my men,

03:43.259 --> 03:45.292
but also guarantee
our reputation

03:45.294 --> 03:48.128
as the most trusted bank
in all of Europe.

03:48.130 --> 03:50.930
And yet you no longer serve
as God's banker.

03:50.932 --> 03:52.965
Well, for now.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.467
A disagreement with
the current policies in Rome.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.169
One I pray
God will soon see rectified.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.838
Do you deserve God's favor,

04:00.840 --> 04:05.542
given the behavior of this artist
I hear you hold in high regard?

04:05.544 --> 04:08.211
Neither da Vinci's actions
nor his fate are my concern.

04:08.213 --> 04:10.680
Only our business
together is.

04:10.682 --> 04:13.249
All I ask is for
the opportunity to show you

04:13.251 --> 04:15.651
what the Medicis
are capable of.

04:17.487 --> 04:19.187
I'm curious.

04:19.189 --> 04:23.958
Approximately how many
florins did...

04:23.960 --> 04:26.393
Rome actually default on?

04:26.395 --> 04:29.829
As of last month, the sum
stood at 87,000 florins.

04:31.765 --> 04:34.433
I never lose count.

04:34.435 --> 04:36.736
Nor do my men.

04:36.738 --> 04:40.338
The Medici family have always
been patrons of the arts.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.574
Particularly those
celebrating the holy faith.

04:43.576 --> 04:48.145
Which is distinctly true of
this creation, Your Highness.

04:51.949 --> 04:54.650
David, as sculpted
by Donatello.

04:59.222 --> 05:03.125
The Lord who saved me from the
claws of the lion and the bear

05:03.127 --> 05:05.960
will save me
from this abomination.

05:05.962 --> 05:09.130
You do not see beauty in its
design, Friar Torquemada?

05:09.132 --> 05:11.766
Is the artist
a sexual deviant,

05:11.768 --> 05:14.735
like others I've heard of
in this region?

05:14.737 --> 05:16.838
I find it lewd.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.006
Please cover it for
the remainder of our visit.

05:24.045 --> 05:25.879
Here's how it works, boy.

05:25.881 --> 05:29.850
You feed me,
I don't stave your head in.

05:29.852 --> 05:31.451
Give it back.

05:31.453 --> 05:34.653
What are you gonna do
about it, scribbler?

05:34.655 --> 05:37.188
I'm gonna take it off you.

05:40.059 --> 05:41.292
What about now?

05:52.002 --> 05:53.702
Come on! Break it up!

05:53.704 --> 05:56.104
(Shouting and grunting)

05:59.741 --> 06:01.441
Not so confident now!

06:18.523 --> 06:21.558
Your food...as requested.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.994
Let me guess.

06:24.996 --> 06:27.829
Lorenzo asked you
to save me.

06:27.831 --> 06:31.699
You will not see Lorenzo in court
and you cannot blame him for that.

06:33.202 --> 06:37.170
Your defense rests
solely with me.

06:37.172 --> 06:39.372
- I advise...
- Pleading guilty?

06:39.374 --> 06:42.341
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Unfortunately, yes.

06:42.343 --> 06:44.409
I see this
as your only option.

06:44.411 --> 06:46.411
If you're lucky,
you may escape castration.

06:46.413 --> 06:49.646
No! No.

06:49.648 --> 06:52.315
No, pleas. No bargains.

06:52.317 --> 06:54.451
I want full refutation
of the charges.

06:54.453 --> 06:57.053
No... I want them dropped.

06:57.055 --> 07:02.291
I remain locked in here on the
accusations of some unknown accuser.

07:02.293 --> 07:04.392
- Unimportant.
- Unimportant?

07:04.394 --> 07:07.662
Unless you can provide an
alibi against the accusation

07:07.664 --> 07:10.698
that you sodomized one...

07:10.700 --> 07:13.534
Jacopo Saltarelli.

07:13.536 --> 07:15.536
Jacopo's no victim.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.607
We have a number of defenses
at our disposal.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.775
- We can blame drink...
- No.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.543
- The use of opiates.
- (Sighs)

07:25.545 --> 07:27.177
Or we can shift blame.

07:27.179 --> 07:29.913
Your mentor Verrochio,
perhaps.

07:29.915 --> 07:31.714
He corrupted you as a boy,

07:31.716 --> 07:33.882
warping your sense
of morality.

07:33.884 --> 07:37.184
Why not go further back?
Claim it began with you.

07:37.186 --> 07:42.155
Oh, fuck! I specifically
asked for Marcgravia evenia!

07:46.461 --> 07:49.896
Ah, here it is.

07:49.898 --> 07:52.598
Are you gonna eat them
or play with them?

07:52.600 --> 07:56.101
- I'll confiscate them.
- Yeah. By all means.

07:56.103 --> 08:00.105
Demonstrate to everyone that I
can terrify you with a leaf.

08:00.107 --> 08:02.073
Perhaps I can dig
an escape tunnel.

08:02.075 --> 08:05.310
Your tunneling days are over,
sodomite.

08:05.312 --> 08:08.813
Deviance is in
the eye of the beholder.

08:08.815 --> 08:11.783
Plants practice a form of it.
Pollination.

08:11.785 --> 08:15.219
They seduce bees, bats,
into transporting their seed.

08:15.221 --> 08:18.021
Because bats use echo
to navigate.

08:18.023 --> 08:21.124
See?

08:21.126 --> 08:24.160
Plants have devised a way
to exploit it.

08:24.162 --> 08:26.662
Cos normal leaves,
they have weak reflections.

08:26.664 --> 08:30.332
But these concave petals,
they...

08:30.334 --> 08:34.202
..they reflect sound
over a much larger area.

08:34.203 --> 08:37.438
Like a cave.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.941
And it draws the bats in. It's
a consensual arrangement.

08:40.943 --> 08:44.111
The bats get nectar
and the flowers get sex.

08:48.616 --> 08:52.252
(Laughs)

08:52.254 --> 08:56.756
Insanity is, of course, another
defense at our disposal.

09:02.395 --> 09:07.832
You are demented if you think
these charges will simply vanish.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.401
They must.

09:10.403 --> 09:12.002
They will.

09:19.042 --> 09:23.512
That pan-faced wench wouldn't
know art if it sat on her face,

09:23.514 --> 09:27.348
which her friar
clearly longs to do.

09:27.350 --> 09:29.985
And yet, having lost
Rome's business,

09:29.987 --> 09:33.622
we need Ferdinand and Isabella
far more than they need us.

09:33.624 --> 09:35.458
Did Ferdinand mention
the trial?

09:35.460 --> 09:37.593
Of course he did.

09:37.595 --> 09:40.696
Rome's strategy with these
charges is brilliant.

09:40.698 --> 09:42.699
They couldn't have come
at a worse time.

09:42.701 --> 09:45.701
Ferdinand and Isabella
face their own difficulties.

09:45.703 --> 09:47.737
Currently they wage war
with Portugal,

09:47.739 --> 09:50.774
while facing
civil uprisings at home.

09:50.776 --> 09:53.910
Perhaps what they require
is distraction.

09:53.912 --> 09:56.480
And what exactly do you think
would amuse them?

09:56.482 --> 10:00.785
A bonfire of Jews?

10:00.787 --> 10:03.821
Let your brother
decide that.

10:03.823 --> 10:05.756
He can create
a theatrical spectacle,

10:05.758 --> 10:07.592
fill the stands
with happy citizens

10:07.594 --> 10:09.494
and show a harmonious city.

10:09.496 --> 10:13.464
Are you mad? Put our faith in
Giuliano's clod-hopping hands?

10:13.466 --> 10:16.734
Like you, he has his talents.

10:16.736 --> 10:19.703
You impress. He charms.

10:37.654 --> 10:40.189
He looks like hell.
Do they feed him in there?

10:45.861 --> 10:48.563
Magistrate,
the defense is prepared.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.665
Will the prosecution
be joining us?

10:50.667 --> 10:54.869
Or have they realized
the error of these charges?

10:54.871 --> 10:56.838
(Door opens)

10:56.840 --> 10:58.739
Your answer has arrived.

11:04.380 --> 11:07.715
What the hell is Francesco Pazzi doing here?
He's not a jurist.

11:07.717 --> 11:09.584
That's good for Leo,
isn't it?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.486
Pazzis are
the Medicis' rivals.

11:11.488 --> 11:16.391
Magistrate, may I raise a point relating
to Signor Pazzi's role in this trial?

11:16.393 --> 11:19.461
To my knowledge, he is not
a member of the Notary Guild.

11:19.463 --> 11:22.565
Signor Pazzi's
associate membership

11:22.567 --> 11:26.335
was approved at an impromptu
session last night.

11:26.337 --> 11:30.538
Which was the appropriate forum
for raising any objections.

11:30.540 --> 11:33.475
Do you wish to make a formal
complaint on behalf of your son?

11:33.477 --> 11:37.312
He's not...

11:37.314 --> 11:39.247
No.

11:39.249 --> 11:41.315
No complaint.

11:41.317 --> 11:45.219
Does the accused have any opening
mitigation to enter into plea?

11:45.221 --> 11:48.822
May it please the court, we will
be contesting all the charges.

11:48.824 --> 11:52.526
Signor da Vinci, do you understand
the potential ramifications

11:52.528 --> 11:54.928
of challenging
these indictments?

11:54.930 --> 11:56.963
(Tapping on table)

11:56.965 --> 12:01.433
My client requests the privilege
to make an opening statement.

12:10.776 --> 12:12.477
(Stops tapping)

12:17.183 --> 12:20.852
I have dedicated my life...

12:20.854 --> 12:24.523
..to the study of nature...

12:24.525 --> 12:28.260
..free from superstition
or distortion.

12:28.262 --> 12:31.096
These accusations, at best,

12:31.098 --> 12:33.532
stem from a wellspring
of ignorance.

12:36.536 --> 12:39.771
And, at worst, it speaks of
political chicanery

12:39.773 --> 12:42.441
to question anyone's intimate
relations in this manner,

12:42.443 --> 12:46.545
cos I have nothing
to be ashamed of.

12:46.547 --> 12:49.014
And I have nothing to defend.

12:49.016 --> 12:52.216
I can vouch for that.
Should put me on the stand.

12:52.218 --> 12:54.486
Hearing how he deflowered
a nun won't help.

12:54.488 --> 12:57.923
He'll only receive a fine.
No-one burns for this any more.

12:57.925 --> 12:59.324
(Clicks fingers)

12:59.326 --> 13:01.626
..of those who will never
be born,

13:01.628 --> 13:03.828
thanks to their vice.

13:03.830 --> 13:07.366
The sodomites in your city...

13:07.368 --> 13:11.703
..have the souls of the
unborn on their conscience.

13:11.705 --> 13:15.841
Those souls
scream for justice -

13:15.843 --> 13:17.810
"To the fire.

13:17.812 --> 13:21.381
To the fire!"

13:21.383 --> 13:25.718
Instead, your leaders
promote sodomy

13:25.720 --> 13:29.322
by levying fines instead
of the proper sanction,

13:29.324 --> 13:32.092
which is...the fire.

13:32.094 --> 13:34.127
Who shat in his wine sack?

13:34.129 --> 13:38.698
When you tax a crime,
you make it a commodity.

13:38.700 --> 13:42.501
The Medicis make their
fortune from this vice

13:42.503 --> 13:47.272
at the price of Florence's
eternal shame.

13:47.274 --> 13:50.408
Objection, Magistrate. I cannot
comprehend why a foreigner

13:50.410 --> 13:52.810
is being allowed
to testify here today.

13:52.812 --> 13:57.414
I called the esteemed Friar
Torquemada as a voice of morality,

13:57.416 --> 14:01.084
reminding us all of our solemn
responsibilities before God.

14:01.086 --> 14:04.387
Would you deny him
that right?

14:04.389 --> 14:09.525
I would only remind the court that the
seriousness of these charges is not in doubt,

14:09.527 --> 14:12.461
but God is not served
by punishing the innocent.

14:12.463 --> 14:15.163
The case remains to be made.

14:15.165 --> 14:18.666
Then perhaps it shall -
after a recess.

14:18.668 --> 14:21.836
(Murmuring)

14:25.273 --> 14:29.176
I've heard, through
the prison grapevine,

14:29.178 --> 14:32.979
that Giuliano's mounting a theatrical
production for the royal couple.

14:32.981 --> 14:35.748
You face prolonged captivity
and possible gelding,

14:35.750 --> 14:38.117
yet your thoughts focus
on trivialities.

14:42.155 --> 14:44.523
See this is delivered
to Zoroaster.

14:44.525 --> 14:48.760
All you wrote was gibberish.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.929
Your imprisonment
affects your mind.

14:54.833 --> 14:59.403
That's perhaps true,
but that's cipher.

14:59.405 --> 15:01.438
If my internment
is to continue,

15:01.440 --> 15:04.908
then there are certain private
wishes I need fulfilled.

15:04.910 --> 15:07.843
Minor matters.
Disposition of my business.

15:07.845 --> 15:10.246
That's all.

15:10.248 --> 15:12.681
It's nothing to trouble you,
Father.

15:12.683 --> 15:16.218
Oh, um...

15:16.220 --> 15:20.622
If Giuliano is yet
to select a text,

15:20.624 --> 15:22.657
may I suggest the Decameron.

15:22.659 --> 15:25.926
My favorite
is the stolen pig story.

15:25.928 --> 15:27.661
It's quite a crowd-pleaser.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.006
What about...a passion play?

15:41.008 --> 15:43.208
Two hours of
moral instruction? No.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.710
I need a more diverting
theatrical piece

15:45.712 --> 15:48.646
to distract the royals
from our little scandal.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.115
- Oedipus Rex?
- No, I think not.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.818
We'd just be trading sodomy
for incest.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.920
I've always loved Lysistrata.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.990
What? Women withholding sex?

15:58.992 --> 16:02.993
Not only is that terrifying,
but Isabella is...

16:02.995 --> 16:05.196
well, frigid.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.832
We probably shouldn't
draw attention to it.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.800
The Birds, then, Excellency?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.102
A fantasy
with pleasing songs.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.305
Sounds boring as shit.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.374
My s...

16:16.376 --> 16:18.909
defendant asked me
to deliver this.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.677
It's in some blasted code,

16:20.679 --> 16:23.580
but as far as I can see, it's not
his last will and testament.

16:23.582 --> 16:26.049
I came to you for your
artistic expertise, Andrea.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.717
Do you have nothing suitable
to offer?

16:27.719 --> 16:29.385
Have you considered
the Decameron?

16:29.387 --> 16:31.387
No. Should we.

16:31.389 --> 16:35.291
It's a satire, brilliantly funny and
penned by a native son of Florence.

16:35.293 --> 16:36.892
With quite a bit of sex
in it.

16:36.894 --> 16:39.162
- Between a man and a woman?
- Of course.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.131
Well, I don't see the
problem. We have our choice.

16:42.133 --> 16:45.869
- Bring me a transcription.
- Is this wise, Excellency?

16:45.871 --> 16:49.139
Wouldn't it be better to
examine the Decameron again?

16:49.141 --> 16:52.575
I'm told the stolen pig
is quite a crowd pleaser.

16:52.577 --> 16:54.944
Signor,
court has been recalled.

17:08.492 --> 17:11.795
Tell me...
Signor Saltarelli,

17:11.797 --> 17:15.165
when you went back
to Signor da Vinci's studio,

17:15.166 --> 17:17.233
what happened?

17:17.234 --> 17:20.670
The Maestro offered
to draw me. Naked.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.372
You've modeled
for other artists before,

17:23.374 --> 17:25.708
so this wasn't unusual.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.409
Did he pay you for your time?

17:27.411 --> 17:29.544
Yes.

17:29.546 --> 17:32.880
- Four gold florins.
- (Murmuring)

17:32.882 --> 17:35.349
A handsome sum
for an evening's work.

17:35.351 --> 17:38.685
The laborer would have to toil
for a month to earn the same.

17:38.687 --> 17:41.554
The payment wasn't just
for the drawing, was it?

17:41.556 --> 17:43.923
No.

17:43.925 --> 17:48.726
- It was for my silence.
- Your silence?

17:48.728 --> 17:52.363
What secret requires a
payment of four gold florins?

17:54.598 --> 17:56.165
He sodomized me.

17:56.167 --> 17:58.267
Did you consent
to this heinous act,

17:58.269 --> 18:00.569
offer any encouragement
whatsoever?

18:00.571 --> 18:02.103
No, sir. None.

18:02.105 --> 18:04.705
So Leonardo da Vinci
forced himself on you?

18:33.028 --> 18:37.131
This was your first time...
being raped?

18:39.833 --> 18:40.900
Yes.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.102
And you were so traumatized,

18:43.104 --> 18:46.272
- you went out and celebrated immediately after?
- I object!

18:46.274 --> 18:48.507
Were you not at
the Barking Dog that evening,

18:48.509 --> 18:51.410
buying drinks for the
establishment's entire clientele?

18:51.412 --> 18:53.679
Yes.

18:53.681 --> 18:57.015
I needed something
to numb the pain.

18:57.017 --> 18:58.817
To be surrounded by friends.

18:58.819 --> 19:03.721
Front or back?

19:03.723 --> 19:07.625
Did my client take you
from the front or the back?

19:07.627 --> 19:09.294
- Both.
- How many times?

19:09.296 --> 19:11.195
- Three.
- It must have been painful.

19:11.197 --> 19:14.332
And yet you chose revelry
over medical aid.

19:14.334 --> 19:18.102
Outrageous! This boy's not the one
who should suffer humiliation.

19:18.104 --> 19:20.738
- What of my client's suffering?
- I will decide.

19:27.512 --> 19:30.013
Do you want to join your son
in the Bargello?

19:30.015 --> 19:33.283
Because that's the way you're heading
with this line of questioning.

19:33.285 --> 19:36.386
The defense must be allowed to
pursue all aspects of the case.

19:36.388 --> 19:39.389
- Your son is guilty.
- The case is not complete.

19:39.391 --> 19:42.059
This trial is a performance,
you oaf.

19:42.061 --> 19:44.596
Like the bread and circuses
of your Medici sponsor.

19:44.598 --> 19:48.400
Now, play your part and
perhaps you will be spared.

19:56.910 --> 19:58.444
I apologize

19:58.446 --> 20:03.215
for dredging up what must be
uncomfortable memories.

20:03.217 --> 20:05.618
You were only performing
your job, Signor.

20:10.157 --> 20:12.291
And what of your job, hm?

20:12.293 --> 20:14.593
How do you survive
beyond the gold florins

20:14.595 --> 20:16.362
my client allegedly gave you?

20:16.364 --> 20:18.798
Surely not on the occasional
modeling assignment.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.900
- Signor da Vinci.
- Perhaps your silence

20:20.902 --> 20:25.505
is because you would prefer not to admit
to your true profession of prostitution.

20:25.507 --> 20:29.976
- Objection!
- How much are you being paid for your performance today?!

20:29.978 --> 20:31.678
- Enough!
- Ha-ha!

20:31.680 --> 20:33.681
The court is adjourned...

20:33.683 --> 20:37.984
so I may consider suitable
punishment for defense council.

20:39.954 --> 20:41.287
(Chatter)

20:56.468 --> 20:58.002
You're quite good at this.

21:01.140 --> 21:04.810
I didn't do that for you.

21:04.812 --> 21:08.680
You disgust me.

21:08.682 --> 21:12.517
Through the lies, some part
of that boy's story is true.

21:15.188 --> 21:19.225
I warned you, Leonardo,
about overreaching.

21:20.494 --> 21:23.530
You have thought life a game,

21:23.532 --> 21:27.267
but Rome's lapdogs have
already decided your fate.

21:27.269 --> 21:29.135
And when they have swayed
the crowd,

21:29.137 --> 21:31.071
they'll leave you to rot
in your cell

21:31.073 --> 21:35.241
until your already-diminished
senses are all but eaten away.

21:47.955 --> 21:50.957
(Bell tolling)

21:50.959 --> 21:54.560
That hustler hurt us.

21:54.562 --> 21:57.597
If the people believe
he's amoral,

21:57.599 --> 22:00.700
I can't pass a guilty verdict
without appearing corrupt myself.

22:00.702 --> 22:03.503
You'll do as instructed.

22:03.505 --> 22:05.538
I'm an elected official.

22:05.540 --> 22:09.076
I'll do as someone
pays me to do.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.311
Don't fret.

22:11.313 --> 22:16.516
Count Riario's coin will fund even your
grandson's campaign for this office.

22:16.518 --> 22:18.751
Perhaps this setback's
a blessing.

22:18.753 --> 22:20.720
The longer we draw out
these proceedings,

22:20.722 --> 22:23.356
the more we embarrass Lorenzo
in the public eye.

22:23.358 --> 22:25.525
And the longer da Vinci rots
in his cell,

22:25.527 --> 22:28.428
the more his mind frays
and the guiltier he looks.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.530
Captain.

22:30.532 --> 22:32.499
Signor?

22:32.501 --> 22:37.070
Gather your men.

22:37.072 --> 22:39.372
This isn't a shopping list.
It's just nonsense.

22:39.374 --> 22:41.541
Don't waste your time.
He wrote it in cipher.

22:41.543 --> 22:43.409
A list of items,
precise instructions

22:43.411 --> 22:48.113
with an absence of an apology for
snubbing me at the Medici celebration.

22:48.115 --> 22:50.916
Magnesium. What does Maestro
da Vinci want with this?

22:50.918 --> 22:53.798
Fucked if I know. But don't speak his
name unless you'd like to join him.

22:56.288 --> 22:58.456
Of all things, why sodomy?

22:58.458 --> 23:00.625
I mean, no-one gets tried
for that.

23:00.627 --> 23:02.593
Yeah, not in Florence.

23:02.595 --> 23:06.530
Go 100 miles in any direction and
suddenly Rome owns your prick.

23:17.775 --> 23:19.376
You have no right to be here!

23:19.378 --> 23:22.045
There must be something here!
Keep searching!

23:22.047 --> 23:25.449
- What are you doing?
- Look over there.

23:25.451 --> 23:29.753
- Look for what?
- Evidence... of who da Vinci truly is.

23:29.755 --> 23:33.091
Sir. Found a hidden compartment
with more journals.

23:33.093 --> 23:35.159
Captain, look at this.

23:35.161 --> 23:36.861
This is what Pazzi wants.

23:42.567 --> 23:45.168
Further investigation
into Leonardo da Vinci

23:45.170 --> 23:49.906
has uncovered more products
of an unnatural mind.

23:49.908 --> 23:51.507
The drawings here before you

23:51.509 --> 23:53.476
were found
in da Vinci's studio.

23:53.478 --> 23:56.880
Notice the extent to which the
deviant has detailed the male...

23:56.882 --> 23:59.249
anatomy.

23:59.251 --> 24:01.251
Was man not created
in God's image?

24:01.253 --> 24:04.621
Genesis, artista?
I'm shocked you got that far.

24:04.623 --> 24:09.526
Studying the human form is an expression,
if not an adoration, of the divine.

24:09.528 --> 24:11.595
Mm. Mm.

24:11.597 --> 24:14.631
But then,
what of this notebook?

24:14.633 --> 24:18.201
Found in a secret
compartment, no less.

24:18.203 --> 24:21.938
Raiding the Maestro's workshop.
That's the obscenity here.

24:21.940 --> 24:24.740
Please excuse the condition
of the evidence, for...

24:24.742 --> 24:28.611
clearly the accused tried to prevent his
heathen beliefs from being presented here

24:28.613 --> 24:32.282
by burning it.

24:32.284 --> 24:35.252
An animal head on human form.

24:35.254 --> 24:38.589
- (Murmuring)
- A pagan god.

24:38.591 --> 24:40.791
And not just one...

24:40.793 --> 24:42.226
Dozens.

24:42.228 --> 24:44.796
The adoration of a heretic.

24:44.798 --> 24:49.935
This is not worship
but an artistic endeavor.

24:49.937 --> 24:51.670
Really?

24:51.672 --> 24:55.541
Are you then suggesting that
this false god is a commission

24:55.543 --> 24:58.977
for your son's
most recent patron?

24:58.979 --> 25:03.249
I submit that not only does this
deviant practice sodomy, but sorcery.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.217
(Murmuring)

25:05.219 --> 25:08.488
Thus I ask the court to consider
no other sentence but death.

25:08.490 --> 25:09.688
(Murmuring)

25:25.271 --> 25:29.940
- You've gone too far.
- This doesn't concern you.

25:29.942 --> 25:34.277
Count Riario made it very clear
that he has plans for da Vinci.

25:34.279 --> 25:36.646
He wanted to see him
arrested, not dead.

25:36.648 --> 25:40.350
Well, that's in the hands
of the court.

25:40.352 --> 25:44.221
What might the court say about your
own family's erotic proclivities?

25:44.223 --> 25:46.523
The rumors of your own wife,
Allegra,

25:46.525 --> 25:50.361
dallying with a strikingly
mannish maidservant.

25:50.363 --> 25:53.097
Shame my family
at your peril, harlot.

25:53.099 --> 25:55.967
Mm. I welcome the invitation.

25:55.969 --> 25:59.804
You seem oddly bothered about the fate
of a man you denounced to the court.

25:59.806 --> 26:02.674
If you have any respect for
the powers that command me,

26:02.676 --> 26:06.045
you will never again mention forcing
me to write the denunciation.

26:06.047 --> 26:08.447
You are reckless, Signor.

26:08.449 --> 26:11.651
You have let your hatred for the
Medicis cloud your purpose.

26:11.653 --> 26:15.355
And your fear clouds yours.

26:15.357 --> 26:17.624
I assure you, Signora,

26:17.626 --> 26:21.729
when Lorenzo and da Vinci
are gone,

26:21.731 --> 26:24.799
there'll be plenty of cocks
willing to fill your void.

26:24.801 --> 26:26.434
(Exhales)

26:40.616 --> 26:42.550
Perhaps a bit more
detail here.

26:42.552 --> 26:46.421
- How does this look, Excellency?
- Lovely. Very lovely.

26:46.423 --> 26:48.256
Giuliano!

26:50.660 --> 26:52.728
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

26:52.730 --> 26:55.163
The Decameron?

26:55.165 --> 26:58.867
I would have words
with my brother. Away.

26:58.869 --> 27:01.937
Away!

27:01.939 --> 27:03.071
Go, go, go.

27:03.073 --> 27:06.175
I asked you to help restore
our reputation.

27:06.177 --> 27:08.911
- You asked me to charm them.
- They are devoted Catholics.

27:08.913 --> 27:11.715
How do you think they will
respond to a play

27:11.717 --> 27:15.519
that's wall to wall nun-sluts
and horny priests?

27:15.521 --> 27:17.721
- It's bawdy! It's vulgar!
- It's Florence.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.690
That's why people love it.

27:19.692 --> 27:22.993
You will cut every scene
that is at all scandalous.

27:22.995 --> 27:26.130
If we fail to secure Ferdinand
and Isabella's accounts,

27:26.132 --> 27:29.467
the Medici Bank is finished.

27:29.469 --> 27:32.403
Time again you prove to be
nothing more than dead weight.

27:32.405 --> 27:35.907
Well, perhaps you should mark me a
traitor and have me killed as well.

27:35.909 --> 27:37.508
(Groaning)

27:46.352 --> 27:49.722
This is one thing
you were never better at.

27:54.261 --> 27:56.295
Sodomy.

27:56.297 --> 27:58.297
Sorcery.

27:58.299 --> 28:01.266
Offerings to a pagan god.

28:01.268 --> 28:04.703
What crimes could be worse
than these?

28:04.705 --> 28:07.138
Thus, by the order
of this court,

28:07.140 --> 28:11.609
the accused - if convicted
of the charge of sorcery -

28:11.611 --> 28:13.444
shall be burned
at the stake...

28:13.446 --> 28:15.313
(Muttering)

28:15.315 --> 28:20.751
..so that his eternal soul is
separated from his perverted body.

28:20.753 --> 28:25.856
We grant the accused one day to
confess and plead mitigation...

28:25.858 --> 28:28.459
..before we deliberate
any further.

28:33.565 --> 28:36.767
<i>You must accept a plea,</i>
<i>Leonardo.</i>

28:36.769 --> 28:38.635
<i>If you confess,</i>
<i>there's a chance!</i>

28:38.637 --> 28:41.105
- To protect Lorenzo?
- To save yourself!

28:41.107 --> 28:43.207
If you won't let me help you,
you will die.

28:43.209 --> 28:45.142
That's a clean end
to your disgrace, then.

28:45.144 --> 28:50.013
Oh, Christ! You are just
as exasperating as she was!

28:52.649 --> 28:55.618
Is she dead?

28:55.620 --> 28:59.254
It makes no difference.
She's gone.

28:59.256 --> 29:03.292
I remind you of her.

29:03.294 --> 29:06.161
That's why you can't stand
to look at me.

29:06.163 --> 29:08.363
Because she left you.

29:08.365 --> 29:11.100
Your mother was a commoner.

29:11.102 --> 29:13.202
She was a servant girl.

29:13.204 --> 29:16.572
People like her
don't leave people like me.

29:19.711 --> 29:22.947
They don't.

29:22.949 --> 29:25.249
It wouldn't make sense.

29:30.256 --> 29:33.125
Genius was wasted on you.

29:45.604 --> 29:47.371
(Sighs)

30:03.618 --> 30:07.420
Do you want something?

30:07.422 --> 30:09.155
Mm.

30:09.157 --> 30:12.357
Da Vinci faces imprisonment,

30:12.359 --> 30:14.492
perhaps death,

30:14.494 --> 30:17.728
and you have the power to
intercede with the magistrate.

30:17.730 --> 30:20.830
(He exhales)

30:20.832 --> 30:24.467
Not without
certain sacrifices...

30:24.469 --> 30:27.436
..given the prudery
of my current guests.

30:30.707 --> 30:35.377
His portrait of me
is remarkable.

30:35.379 --> 30:38.513
But it won't remind me of you nearly
so well if it's never finished.

30:38.515 --> 30:43.150
Botticelli or Ghirlandaio
can take over.

30:43.152 --> 30:46.686
Is that why you want
the artista freed?

30:46.688 --> 30:50.490
- To immortalize you?
- No.

30:50.492 --> 30:53.192
To protect us.

30:53.194 --> 30:56.161
Da Vinci's gift for inventions
saved our lives, Lorenzo.

30:56.163 --> 31:00.264
Well, he can invent his way
out of his dilemma.

31:02.401 --> 31:04.668
Good night,

31:04.670 --> 31:06.303
my dear.

31:15.713 --> 31:20.783
Um...does this periscope thing
do what it's supposed to do?

31:20.785 --> 31:24.920
I followed the specifications but
your guess is as good as mine.

31:24.922 --> 31:26.889
What about the other items
on his list?

31:26.891 --> 31:30.159
Um, this paste will hold a man for
a good while before dissolving.

31:30.161 --> 31:33.762
I tested this potion out on Nico.
Knocked him out for nearly 15 minutes.

31:33.764 --> 31:37.699
You might have told me first. I could
have split my head open when I collapsed.

31:37.701 --> 31:40.736
Can anyone tell me - who are
we gluing to what and why?

31:40.738 --> 31:43.939
Look, our friend might have
lost his wits in prison.

31:43.941 --> 31:45.340
It happens.

31:45.342 --> 31:47.476
A prison, a potion,
a periscope,

31:47.478 --> 31:49.178
a pig and a paste pot.

31:49.180 --> 31:52.781
If a madman created a scavenger hunt,
this is what it would look like.

31:54.417 --> 31:55.918
(Screeching)

32:01.691 --> 32:06.328
(Leonardo whimpers)

32:06.330 --> 32:11.033
You thought you could
outsmart us all, artista.

32:11.035 --> 32:14.403
But God's wiser than you.

32:14.405 --> 32:16.271
And he's on our side.

32:36.660 --> 32:37.204
(Laughs)

32:41.667 --> 32:44.167
- What happens now?
- We wait.

32:44.169 --> 32:46.136
- For what?
- I don't know.

32:46.138 --> 32:47.538
He said it would be obvious.

32:47.540 --> 32:52.376
(Screeching and explosions)

32:52.378 --> 32:56.848
- What's going on?
- What is that?

32:56.850 --> 33:00.986
I guess that's pretty clear.

33:00.988 --> 33:02.754
Da Vinci!

33:13.365 --> 33:15.533
Stop the explosions.

33:18.736 --> 33:20.671
What?

33:20.673 --> 33:24.575
(Coughs) You think I've organized
a bombardment from my cell?

33:24.577 --> 33:26.777
I never cease
to amaze myself.

33:44.329 --> 33:45.930
Where are they coming from?

33:45.932 --> 33:47.799
You took your time
coming to visit.

33:47.801 --> 33:50.701
You want my company now, with
your little prick on the line!

33:50.703 --> 33:54.739
- We have minutes, Zo.
- Is it true what they say? This place sours your brain?

33:54.741 --> 33:58.076
- Do you want to help me?
- There's a way out through the kitchens.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.274
We're not going together.
You're staying.

34:00.276 --> 34:03.382
- Fuck, no.
- Look...

34:03.384 --> 34:04.984
They can't know I've escaped.

34:04.986 --> 34:07.419
They need to think
I'm still here.

34:07.421 --> 34:10.389
Wear that. It's rat's hair.

34:10.391 --> 34:12.525
Cloak myself in bat shit
and pretend I'm you?

34:12.527 --> 34:16.329
I swear to God I'm not mad.

34:16.331 --> 34:18.331
I'm desperate.

34:18.333 --> 34:21.367
Enraged.
In need of a good meal.

34:21.369 --> 34:23.435
But I am not mad.

34:26.672 --> 34:28.706
You ask a great deal
of your friends.

34:28.708 --> 34:30.370
I know.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.745
Sodomite.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.089
Everybody's still locked in,
sir!

34:55.569 --> 34:59.104
Whatever your friends
planned, it failed.

34:59.106 --> 35:03.475
(Zoroaster grunts)

35:03.477 --> 35:05.643
Fuck you, Leo.

35:05.645 --> 35:09.614
(Screeching and explosions)

35:09.616 --> 35:12.349
Phosphorus bat shit bombs.

35:12.351 --> 35:17.153
Maybe I am losing my mind.

35:17.155 --> 35:20.156
So the grand plan is
we all burn at the stake?

35:20.158 --> 35:22.291
It's a straightforward
operation.

35:22.293 --> 35:26.196
It's the product of solitude and delirium!
It's totally mad!

35:26.198 --> 35:28.732
Doesn't certain art
require a touch of madness?

35:28.734 --> 35:32.369
I suppose you are aware that this device
can only function in the daylight?

35:32.371 --> 35:35.139
- I've prepared for that.
- Of course you have.

35:35.141 --> 35:38.442
Have you given any thought to what
will happen if it doesn't work?

35:38.444 --> 35:42.346
- None whatsoever.
- (Splutters) I'm both terrified and reassured.

35:42.348 --> 35:46.784
I will be no-one's pawn.

35:46.786 --> 35:49.553
They put me on display
to be ridiculed,

35:49.555 --> 35:53.056
as a tool
to sodomize Lorenzo.

35:53.058 --> 35:55.092
They took away my liberty.

35:55.094 --> 35:59.931
And now they will taste
the same bile that I have!

36:00.432 --> 36:02.801
Besides...

36:02.803 --> 36:08.441
What other plan
gains me what I crave? Hm?

36:08.443 --> 36:11.711
Which is what, Leo?

36:11.713 --> 36:15.449
The magistrate's arse.

36:15.451 --> 36:18.351
Before we head in to the
performance, have I shown you this?

36:18.353 --> 36:20.887
A bench?

36:20.889 --> 36:22.322
We have benches in Aragon.

36:22.324 --> 36:25.591
Yes, yes,
but please notice...

36:25.593 --> 36:30.163
notice the markings
along its edge.

36:30.165 --> 36:34.333
Once a week, I open my study to
anyone who wishes to approach me

36:34.335 --> 36:39.339
and petitioners mark on the bench
to indicate their place in line.

36:39.341 --> 36:42.075
Doesn't that open you
to rabble?

36:42.077 --> 36:44.343
(Laughs) On occasion, yes.

36:44.345 --> 36:47.380
But it also keeps
Florence thriving.

36:47.382 --> 36:50.550
As the old saying has it,
"Pecunia non olet."

36:50.552 --> 36:54.620
Money has no smell.

36:54.622 --> 36:57.756
We Medicis have no historic
name like the Pazzis.

36:57.758 --> 37:01.693
We must rely on our wits.

37:01.695 --> 37:05.563
We innovate. We create
the financial instruments

37:05.565 --> 37:08.299
on which the entire continent
now relies.

37:08.301 --> 37:10.501
The motto of
the house of Medici?

37:10.503 --> 37:15.572
"In God...and profit."

37:15.574 --> 37:19.843
And that profit emerges
from vision.

37:21.679 --> 37:25.349
See, names and lineages
and titles...

37:25.351 --> 37:28.184
..they fade, but currency...

37:28.186 --> 37:32.455
currency stays current.

37:32.457 --> 37:35.592
And that, more than
any other bank in the land,

37:35.594 --> 37:39.930
is the expertise
of the house of Medici.

37:42.466 --> 37:43.900
(Lorenzo chuckles)

37:43.902 --> 37:49.439
This florin,
with our seal on the front...

37:49.441 --> 37:52.609
What other currency
is named after a city?

37:52.611 --> 37:55.645
Only Florence is so identified
with financial success

37:55.647 --> 37:58.382
to lay claim to that honor.

37:58.384 --> 38:02.620
There is a new world here...

38:02.622 --> 38:04.388
..in Florence.

38:09.860 --> 38:14.664
I await your decision.

38:14.666 --> 38:19.136
I wonder if his actors tonight
will speechify quite like he does.

38:20.204 --> 38:22.606
Players, attend.

38:22.608 --> 38:27.277
We will be performing the Decameron
this evening, but not all the parts.

38:27.279 --> 38:30.647
I've been counseled to remove
all but the most pious pieces

38:30.649 --> 38:32.983
for the deference
of our regal guests.

38:32.985 --> 38:37.488
But...Florence is not
their home. It's ours.

38:37.490 --> 38:40.558
And they will either love it
or leave.

38:40.560 --> 38:45.095
Prepare our production so that only
the bawdy and vulgar stories remain.

38:46.131 --> 38:48.465
Excellency,
what of your brother?

38:48.467 --> 38:50.801
He'll laugh his arse off
with the rest of them.

38:50.803 --> 38:53.436
- And this pig, Signor?
- Stays in.

38:53.438 --> 38:57.074
For what's our city
without a pig or two?

38:57.076 --> 38:59.076
(Door bangs)

39:08.554 --> 39:11.023
(Excited chatter)

39:11.025 --> 39:13.292
Here.

39:13.294 --> 39:17.731
And...let me just...

39:17.733 --> 39:19.666
I'm taking little Sixtus
for air.

39:23.771 --> 39:27.340
How did it go today?

39:27.342 --> 39:31.677
They have the tacit trait
of all good leaders.

39:31.679 --> 39:34.746
Their faces belie nothing.

39:38.184 --> 39:44.890
I cannot believe we are to be
subjected to such decadence.

39:44.892 --> 39:48.493
Dying regimes flail dramatically
in their death throes.

39:48.495 --> 39:53.599
And trust me when I predict the days
of the Medici regime are numbered.

39:56.203 --> 39:58.504
- (Cheering)
- Buona sera.

39:58.506 --> 40:01.373
Buona sera.

40:01.375 --> 40:05.310
Tonight we give you
a gift of Florence.

40:05.312 --> 40:07.746
Boccaccio's the Decameron.

40:07.748 --> 40:11.784
As a favor to you, I've chosen
not to present all the pieces.

40:11.786 --> 40:13.085
(Groaning)

40:13.087 --> 40:16.055
100 stories takes a long time

40:16.057 --> 40:18.057
and I didn't want
the poor souls in the front

40:18.059 --> 40:21.194
to be smoked out by the stench
of Maurizio the shepherd.

40:21.196 --> 40:22.829
(Laughter)

40:22.831 --> 40:27.901
Now, this evening, you will witness
the true spirit of Florence.

40:27.903 --> 40:29.937
Her faith and virtues

40:29.939 --> 40:33.507
right along with her freedom
and vulgarities.

40:33.509 --> 40:36.310
Enjoy...the Decameron.

40:36.312 --> 40:38.579
(Cheering)

40:40.982 --> 40:45.686
Alas, I've used my last coin
on ribbons for my hair.

40:47.088 --> 40:50.123
The aunt who wanted bread
will surely be angry with me.

40:50.125 --> 40:53.426
Whatever am I to do?

40:53.428 --> 40:55.695
- (Laughter)
- Alas...

40:55.697 --> 40:59.966
I have wandered this road
for many a day and night.

40:59.968 --> 41:04.071
What I would not give
to touch a woman's flesh.

41:04.073 --> 41:05.572
(AUDIENCE) Ooh!

41:05.574 --> 41:09.443
Why, I'd give my legs
underneath me.

41:09.445 --> 41:12.146
- Ah.
- (Laughter)

41:12.148 --> 41:16.417
Only when Saint Arrigo's hand
does touch her bones to mine

41:16.419 --> 41:19.788
will I be healed in time.

41:19.790 --> 41:23.825
Perhaps I could try to lift
with all my might.

41:23.827 --> 41:26.528
And if you could,
I'd surely hold on tight.

41:26.530 --> 41:29.798
Ooh. Argh!

41:29.800 --> 41:31.299
(Laughter)

41:35.304 --> 41:36.971
(Ferdinand chuckles)

41:43.879 --> 41:45.646
What's this...?

41:49.685 --> 41:54.288
A romantic assignation requires
the appropriate light.

41:56.058 --> 42:02.130
Now, you asked me what crime could
possibly be worse than sodomy or sorcery.

42:02.132 --> 42:04.199
Well, I never turn down
a challenge.

42:04.201 --> 42:05.834
Be still. Be still.

42:05.836 --> 42:10.105
Or my friend here may get
aroused by your movements.

42:10.107 --> 42:11.974
(Laughs)

42:11.976 --> 42:14.477
The fixative will last
a good while,

42:14.479 --> 42:18.080
so listen closely.

42:18.082 --> 42:22.551
Your reputation
depends on it.

42:22.553 --> 42:26.155
At the far end of this
arrangement of prisms and lenses

42:26.157 --> 42:28.024
lies a camera obscura.

42:28.026 --> 42:31.962
It's usually employed to delight
crowds with projections of nature.

42:31.964 --> 42:37.001
But unnatural projections
work just as well.

42:37.003 --> 42:39.770
- You're insane.
- Yes.

42:39.772 --> 42:42.573
Now reap the whirlwind.

42:50.315 --> 42:52.216
(Leonardo chuckles)

43:10.434 --> 43:12.835
God grants all wishes...

43:12.837 --> 43:15.737
(Laughter)

43:23.713 --> 43:25.981
They cannot see your face.

43:25.983 --> 43:27.650
Yet.

43:33.023 --> 43:34.757
(Groans)

43:34.759 --> 43:37.860
All I need to do is rotate you a
few degrees, open the prism again,

43:37.862 --> 43:42.098
and your notoriety will be
assured for centuries.

43:42.100 --> 43:46.035
- What do you want?
- Your mark on four documents.

43:46.037 --> 43:49.705
One, an irrevocable dismissal
of the charges against me

43:49.707 --> 43:52.041
and indemnity against
future prosecution.

43:52.043 --> 43:57.313
Two, a full confession to your crime of
bestiality in the palace of justice,

43:57.315 --> 43:59.949
to be held in safekeeping
in the event of my death.

43:59.951 --> 44:04.187
Three, a donation of
50 florins to Piero da Vinci

44:04.189 --> 44:07.390
for tolerating
your so-called courtroom.

44:07.392 --> 44:12.195
Four, the release to me of the secret
denunciation which accused me.

44:12.197 --> 44:16.265
You will make your mark on all four
documents before this flare dies

44:16.267 --> 44:20.036
or I will open the prism again and
expose your vice for all to see.

44:20.038 --> 44:23.639
I'll tell them
what you've done!

44:23.641 --> 44:27.376
Your preferred explanation
is that this entire scene

44:27.378 --> 44:29.879
was engineered
in your inner sanctum

44:29.881 --> 44:33.349
by a man that all Florence knows
is in solitary confinement?

44:33.351 --> 44:35.484
The people will never
believe it of me.

44:35.486 --> 44:39.822
The more scandalous the accusation,
the greater their appetite for it.

44:39.824 --> 44:45.695
The gallery was filled
at my trial

44:45.697 --> 44:49.365
It'll be standing room only
for a magistrate's trial.

44:49.367 --> 44:51.801
And should you renege
on our agreement,

44:51.803 --> 44:56.240
then this shroud...
treated with silver nitrate

44:56.242 --> 44:58.309
using the methods
of Albertus Magnus,

44:58.311 --> 45:01.612
bears a lasting record
of your infamy

45:01.614 --> 45:04.749
which I would be happy
to display in the future.

45:04.751 --> 45:07.518
And even if you could
convince people

45:07.520 --> 45:12.156
somehow that this isn't you,

45:12.158 --> 45:14.225
you will spend
the rest of your life

45:14.227 --> 45:17.060
answering the undying rumors.

45:17.062 --> 45:19.630
Cos people believe
what's before their eyes.

45:19.632 --> 45:23.801
And if I can get this image seen
in the skies above Florence,

45:23.803 --> 45:27.271
I can get it seen everywhere.

45:27.273 --> 45:31.375
This is how history
will remember you.

45:31.377 --> 45:33.912
Fucking a pig

45:33.914 --> 45:37.315
in the middle
of your courtroom.

45:37.317 --> 45:40.519
Lies, truth...

45:40.521 --> 45:42.587
It's irrelevant.

45:42.589 --> 45:46.358
The best story wins.

45:48.528 --> 45:51.797
Oh, what confusion
comes with light.

45:51.799 --> 45:54.933
Bring me the darkness
of the night.

45:54.935 --> 45:58.403
So much unseen,
so much to know.

45:58.405 --> 46:03.241
In the dark,
the best surprise does show.

46:05.110 --> 46:07.278
(Cheering)

46:07.280 --> 46:10.748
A hysterical spectacle,
Your Excellency.

46:10.750 --> 46:13.217
The image in the sky. I've
never seen anything like it.

46:13.219 --> 46:16.653
Theatre is...magic.

46:16.655 --> 46:19.389
- (Laughter)
- That it is!

46:19.391 --> 46:22.592
Well done, everyone.
Well done!

46:43.147 --> 46:45.548
The defendant
stands accused of...

46:45.550 --> 46:49.452
deviancy and heresy.

46:49.454 --> 46:53.190
After due consideration, it
is the ruling of this court

46:53.192 --> 46:56.760
that the prosecution was unable
to prove these crimes true.

46:56.762 --> 47:00.731
I hereby dismiss all charges
against Leonardo da Vinci.

47:09.041 --> 47:11.843
- Well, I'm a genius.
- You still smell like bat shit.

47:26.792 --> 47:29.327
Ah, bravo!

47:29.329 --> 47:31.229
Bravo, Leo.

47:31.231 --> 47:35.466
That's the man
you should be congratulating.

47:35.468 --> 47:37.535
I don't know how
you did that,

47:37.537 --> 47:39.470
but enjoy your freedom
while you may.

47:39.472 --> 47:42.139
For what Rome cannot
accomplish through the courts,

47:42.141 --> 47:44.441
it will by other means.

47:44.443 --> 47:46.108
Stay out of trouble.

47:46.110 --> 47:47.576
Father...

47:51.247 --> 47:53.282
I will.

47:53.284 --> 47:56.150
Your path
has never been easy.

48:04.058 --> 48:07.427
In my land, power derives
from birthright.

48:12.733 --> 48:15.167
I had to marry
my pug-faced cousin

48:15.169 --> 48:19.037
to keep power
in the family.

48:19.039 --> 48:20.839
But you and your brother,

48:20.841 --> 48:22.974
with no royal blood at all,

48:22.976 --> 48:26.010
rally an entire city.

48:26.012 --> 48:29.613
Not out of fear, but joy.

48:32.150 --> 48:37.287
You even know some of them
by name.

48:37.289 --> 48:40.890
And they love you for it.

48:40.892 --> 48:45.594
You've left your mark on me.

48:45.596 --> 48:49.563
And I leave my mark
in Florence.

48:54.568 --> 48:57.436
We agree to your terms.

48:57.438 --> 49:02.407
The Medicis will be
the bankers of a new Spain.

49:03.809 --> 49:08.679
(Lively chatter and laughter)

49:08.681 --> 49:12.816
To Florence, where you can bugger
whoever, wherever, and get away with it.

49:12.818 --> 49:15.686
To the friends
who make it possible.

49:15.688 --> 49:17.921
Seriously,
I'm lucky to have you.

49:17.923 --> 49:21.990
Remember that when you're washing
the bat shit from my arse crack.

49:28.596 --> 49:30.130
(Gargles)

49:39.638 --> 49:43.841
If I'd produced this at the trial, no
amount of sophistry would have saved you.

49:43.843 --> 49:47.344
But I wanted to see you
exposed, not killed.

49:49.713 --> 49:52.115
Why?

49:52.117 --> 49:56.152
What you have with women
isn't love.

49:56.154 --> 49:57.753
You're with them out of fear.

49:57.755 --> 50:02.024
I'm curious by nature.

50:02.026 --> 50:06.595
Desire... It's not as simple
as one sex or the other.

50:10.534 --> 50:13.902
I'm sorry I hurt you.

50:13.904 --> 50:17.873
My experiments
and curiosities, they're...

50:17.875 --> 50:20.710
They're not always without cost
and I should mind that better.

50:20.712 --> 50:25.481
But trust me - trust me...

50:25.483 --> 50:28.217
..no-one defines me.

50:32.323 --> 50:34.991
Not Florence's outdated laws

50:34.993 --> 50:36.426
and certainly...

50:36.428 --> 50:40.196
certainly...not you.

50:45.469 --> 50:50.373
Your infatuation will fade and
you will find others to love.

50:50.375 --> 50:52.409
I have no doubt.

51:13.730 --> 51:17.133
Every kiss sends
a message.

51:17.135 --> 51:21.771
That one...was goodbye.

51:21.773 --> 51:23.173
Goodbye?

51:38.291 --> 51:39.958
(Lucrezia hums)

51:47.701 --> 51:52.805
Do you know, I've never heard
that tune from anyone except you.

51:52.807 --> 51:57.076
My father used to hum it
to me when I was a child.

51:57.078 --> 52:00.113
Done.

52:00.115 --> 52:02.015
Where is he now?

52:05.819 --> 52:09.422
I cannot say.

52:09.424 --> 52:12.659
Losing a parent
breaks hearts.

52:12.661 --> 52:15.361
My father's always been...

52:15.363 --> 52:18.364
lost to me.

52:18.366 --> 52:20.933
And your mother?

52:20.935 --> 52:26.237
In a land with no name,
across the seas.

52:26.239 --> 52:30.041
If the clues I've gathered
on my quest are true.

52:30.043 --> 52:34.044
Escaping that denunciation,
perhaps I can find her again.

52:36.047 --> 52:38.182
How did you come by this?

52:39.584 --> 52:43.321
These denunciations
are usually so well guarded.

52:43.323 --> 52:47.592
Mm. Well, I have a penchant
for acquiring things...

52:48.528 --> 52:50.596
..that are well guarded.

52:52.799 --> 52:54.867
(She moans)

52:56.603 --> 52:59.239
And what do you plan
on doing with it?

53:01.308 --> 53:03.476
Hm?

53:03.478 --> 53:09.015
I plan on using it to find
and confront my accuser.

53:09.017 --> 53:10.650
Obviously.

53:10.652 --> 53:16.523
Cos whoever wrote those words
almost took my freedom and my life.

53:16.525 --> 53:20.527
And what if your accuser didn't
intend for it to go that far?

53:20.529 --> 53:23.363
What other outcome
could they have intended?

53:23.365 --> 53:24.898
- It was a sodomy charge.
- I know.

53:24.900 --> 53:27.800
I only got out
with nerve and wit.

53:32.874 --> 53:34.941
Hm.

53:38.747 --> 53:41.548
That belonged to someone
very dear to me.

53:41.550 --> 53:44.551
Hm?

53:44.553 --> 53:47.421
Here.

53:47.423 --> 53:52.325
Carry it with you. Keep it
safe in case anything happens.

53:52.327 --> 53:54.361
Why would anything
happen to you?

53:54.363 --> 53:56.629
Because these are
uncertain times.

53:56.631 --> 54:01.300
And shall I flaunt it
near Lorenzo?

54:01.302 --> 54:04.703
That would alleviate
any uncertainty.

54:04.705 --> 54:06.972
You'd be wise not to.

54:15.247 --> 54:18.616
Have you ever been in love...
Signora?

54:19.551 --> 54:21.618
Um...

54:25.891 --> 54:28.792
In my pursuits,
love is a liability.

54:29.728 --> 54:31.795
Mine, too.

54:33.531 --> 54:35.699
Maybe that's
what we share.

54:35.701 --> 54:37.401
What?

54:37.403 --> 54:40.070
Both of us bound to
a life without love.

55:19.912 --> 55:23.114
You seem surprised.

55:23.116 --> 55:27.319
I told you I would return once you had
sipped from the fountain of memory.

55:32.057 --> 55:34.259
But I haven't.

55:36.829 --> 55:39.731
Are you sure?

55:39.733 --> 55:44.302
You did not experience
something while imprisoned?

55:54.013 --> 55:55.947
That was a dream.

55:55.949 --> 55:57.983
It was nothing more.

55:57.985 --> 56:00.952
Surely you,
who remembers all,

56:00.954 --> 56:03.555
know it was no dream.

56:03.557 --> 56:07.192
It was nothing.

56:07.194 --> 56:09.394
It was just...

56:09.396 --> 56:11.864
Just flashes. Incoher...

56:13.533 --> 56:17.102
Close your eyes
and see again.

56:19.639 --> 56:22.375
<i>Return to the cave,</i>
<i>Leonardo.</i>

56:25.179 --> 56:27.814
There were bodies.
I saw bodies.

56:31.787 --> 56:33.888
I s... I saw a man...

56:38.127 --> 56:39.794
..hanging upside down.

56:40.763 --> 56:42.797
I... (Gasps)

56:44.333 --> 56:47.669
I thought... I thought
he was dead, like the rest.

56:50.506 --> 56:52.241
But he was alive.

56:52.243 --> 56:55.410
- Who was it, Leonardo?
- I...

56:59.415 --> 57:00.949
Free me.

57:01.684 --> 57:03.251
Free me!

57:08.690 --> 57:10.925
- It doesn't make sense.
- What did you see?

57:11.860 --> 57:13.361
Free me.

57:15.431 --> 57:16.998
It was me.
