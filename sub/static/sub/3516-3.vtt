00:56.170 --> 00:59.623
Page 43, section 7.
We'd like some clarification.

00:59.623 --> 01:01.221
Section 7 has to do with
the evaluative measures--

01:01.221 --> 01:02.851
"Evaluative measures."

01:02.851 --> 01:04.001
What we're talking about here
are performance standards,

01:04.034 --> 01:05.504
plain and simple.

01:05.504 --> 01:06.592
We can't have that.
We open that can of worms--

01:06.592 --> 01:07.647
Gotta take it out, Frank.

01:07.647 --> 01:08.925
The administration wants it in.

01:08.925 --> 01:10.588
Then we're all wasting
our time.

01:10.588 --> 01:12.026
Well, look, I can cut down
the frequency of testing,

01:12.026 --> 01:13.625
but it's got to be
part of the overall--

01:13.625 --> 01:15.095
That's the thin edge
of a two-ton wedge.

01:15.095 --> 01:16.502
- No way, non-debatable.
- All right, hold on.

01:16.502 --> 01:17.621
There's no harm
in hearing them out, right?

01:17.621 --> 01:19.123
Frank, what do you have
in mind?

01:19.123 --> 01:21.393
We adjust article 4.
Hand me article 4.

01:21.393 --> 01:23.567
We go every three years
instead of two.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.933
Frank, for us to even
consider testing--

01:25.933 --> 01:28.043
Marty, we can't
negotiate time intervals here.

01:28.074 --> 01:29.705
If-- I'm just saying if--

01:29.705 --> 01:31.815
The frequency could never be
more than five years.

01:31.815 --> 01:33.861
Look, five is a little high,
but if you can bend on that--

01:33.861 --> 01:36.067
- Marty.
- Wait, wait, wait. And it's not just frequency.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.889
Veteran teachers would have
to be exempt

01:37.889 --> 01:40.446
if they have a proven record of
excellence with the students.

01:40.446 --> 01:41.693
Well, excuse me for a moment.

01:41.693 --> 01:43.132
Corey, will you take
the reins on this?

01:43.132 --> 01:45.114
Right, so, article 4--
in terms of exceptions--

01:45.114 --> 01:47.831
I've been saying for years
that we should tear it down.

01:47.831 --> 01:51.284
It's vulgar, it's an
embarrassment to the county,

01:51.284 --> 01:52.946
but time and time again
Frank Underwood

01:52.946 --> 01:55.216
has fought to keep it standing.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.782
If it weren't for him,

01:56.782 --> 01:58.381
the Peachoid would've been
replaced ages ago.

01:58.381 --> 02:01.833
And Jessica masters
would still be alive.

02:01.833 --> 02:04.550
The congressman needs
to answer for this tragedy.

02:04.550 --> 02:05.989
What exactly happened?

02:05.989 --> 02:08.098
A 17-year-old girl

02:08.098 --> 02:10.465
ran off the road texting
her boyfriend, and I quote,

02:10.465 --> 02:13.310
"doesn't the Peachoid
look like a giant..."

02:13.310 --> 02:15.484
- And then she lost control of the car.
- Jesus.

02:15.516 --> 02:17.913
Orrin's making a big fuss
in the local press.

02:17.913 --> 02:19.767
And he's pushing
the parents to sue Gaffney.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.645
Sue Gaffney?
It's in his own jurisdiction.

02:22.645 --> 02:24.307
It's worth throwing
Gaffney under the bus

02:24.307 --> 02:25.426
to drag you into the mess.

02:25.426 --> 02:26.992
He's after my seat again.

02:26.992 --> 02:28.942
Has he learned
absolutely nothing?

02:28.942 --> 02:31.660
It's a full-on smear
campaign, boss.

02:31.660 --> 02:33.162
He's out to destroy you.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.857
With this? It's a peach,
for Christ sake.

02:34.857 --> 02:36.583
Let him make a fool
out of himself.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.012
No, he will make a fool
out of you.

02:39.012 --> 02:41.154
If he spins this right,
gets national coverage--

02:41.154 --> 02:43.232
National coverage?
It's a joke.

02:43.232 --> 02:44.351
And you will be the butt of it.

02:44.351 --> 02:46.365
We can't afford that right now,

02:46.365 --> 02:49.818
not when you're in the spotlight
with the education bill.

02:49.818 --> 02:52.311
This thing has caused me
so much damn trouble.

02:52.311 --> 02:55.093
- I know.
- So who should I call, parents?

02:55.093 --> 02:56.819
Phone call's
not going to cut it.

02:56.819 --> 02:58.609
- You need to go down there.
- Can it wait until Monday?

02:58.609 --> 02:59.952
We get on this thing right now,
we can contain it.

02:59.952 --> 03:01.934
We wait until Monday,

03:01.934 --> 03:04.108
then there's no way to know how much
this is going to blow up on us.

03:04.108 --> 03:05.674
I can't go down to Gaffney.
The unions have just--

03:05.674 --> 03:06.985
- We postpone--
- They're gonna be livid.

03:06.985 --> 03:08.072
Marty's reasonable, okay?

03:08.072 --> 03:09.542
He will explain to them.

03:09.542 --> 03:10.981
And they're just supposed
to understand and accept

03:10.981 --> 03:12.547
that I had to get up
from the negotiating table

03:12.547 --> 03:14.433
because some two-bit county
administrator wants to--

03:14.433 --> 03:16.096
I don't want
to interrupt you, sir,

03:16.096 --> 03:17.343
but this is not just
about Orrin.

03:17.343 --> 03:19.069
It's about the parents.

03:21.179 --> 03:22.553
Now, you think
about the lawsuit.

03:24.088 --> 03:25.846
What happens
if you have to testify?

03:25.846 --> 03:28.052
Subpoenas, depositions.

03:28.052 --> 03:29.778
You get dragged
into a court battle,

03:29.778 --> 03:31.792
there is no education bill.

03:33.455 --> 03:35.021
We can't ignore this.

03:37.227 --> 03:39.305
I just hate
this small-ball crap.

05:10.831 --> 05:13.100
It's called the what?
The peach what?

05:13.100 --> 05:14.315
The Peachoid.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.233
It's a giant water tower

05:16.233 --> 05:17.352
in the shape of a peach.

05:17.352 --> 05:20.101
Oh, wow.

05:20.101 --> 05:22.499
I just googled it.
"The Peachoid."

05:22.499 --> 05:24.257
She was 17, Linda.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.111
You're right.
I'm sorry.

05:26.111 --> 05:28.189
- I need another week.
- No, that's not going to work.

05:28.189 --> 05:29.276
The president makes
his speech on Tuesday.

05:29.276 --> 05:30.267
We've already announced.

05:30.267 --> 05:31.930
Speeches can be rescheduled.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.976
We have to show some progress
on education, Frank.

05:33.976 --> 05:35.670
The first hundred days
is almost over.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.173
If we push back the speech,

05:37.173 --> 05:38.611
it'll look like we're
spinning our wheels.

05:38.611 --> 05:39.794
All right,
I'll work something out.

05:39.794 --> 05:41.233
Thank you, Linda.

05:44.813 --> 05:46.316
Frank, these are the heads

05:46.316 --> 05:48.585
of the two largest teachers
unions in the country.

05:48.585 --> 05:50.791
- I understand.
- They flew here on a weekend.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.709
Doug will lead the charge.
Congressman Phillips is well vetted--

05:52.709 --> 05:54.787
They flew here to see you,
Frank.

05:54.787 --> 05:55.778
You're managing this bill.

05:55.778 --> 05:57.153
Put this in the other bag.

05:57.153 --> 05:58.623
And I'll be in
constant communication.

05:58.623 --> 06:00.126
Anything big comes up,
I'm a phone call away.

06:00.158 --> 06:01.820
It's a 300-page document.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.355
We need you in that room.

06:03.355 --> 06:04.506
I would stay if I could,

06:04.506 --> 06:05.976
but this is my home district.

06:05.976 --> 06:07.862
Now, Marty,
cut me a little slack here.

06:07.862 --> 06:09.333
We'll get it done.

06:09.333 --> 06:10.835
You and I go way back.

06:10.835 --> 06:13.169
Have I ever let you down?

06:13.169 --> 06:14.384
No, you haven't.

06:14.384 --> 06:16.909
And I don't intend
to start now.

06:24.486 --> 06:26.212
Hello?

06:50.252 --> 06:52.266
- Gillian?
- Claire.

06:52.266 --> 06:54.025
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

06:54.025 --> 06:55.335
Yeah-- I'm a little
under the weather.

06:55.335 --> 06:56.742
I don't want to get you sick.

06:56.742 --> 06:58.213
Well, if you're feeling ill,
we can--

06:58.213 --> 06:59.491
No, no, no, I'm fine.
It's just a cold.

06:59.491 --> 07:01.186
Well, thank you for coming in.

07:01.186 --> 07:02.177
Of course.

07:02.177 --> 07:03.327
Shall we talk in my office?

07:03.359 --> 07:05.789
These are really cool
photographs.

07:05.789 --> 07:06.908
Oh, thank you.

07:06.908 --> 07:08.698
Adam Galloway
took the pictures.

07:08.698 --> 07:09.753
Have you heard of him?

07:09.753 --> 07:11.288
No.

07:11.288 --> 07:13.238
I met him at the Whitney
biennial a couple years ago

07:13.238 --> 07:14.389
and commissioned him
to do these.

07:14.389 --> 07:17.489
He just had a big show at ps1.

07:17.489 --> 07:19.088
I'm not up to date
on the art world.

07:19.088 --> 07:20.686
That's all right.

07:20.718 --> 07:22.700
We're not here to talk
about photography. Are we?

07:22.700 --> 07:24.331
My office is over here.

07:24.331 --> 07:25.386
You run into any trouble,
you call me.

07:25.386 --> 07:26.409
I got it covered.

07:26.409 --> 07:27.496
Gene Clancy know I'm coming?

07:27.496 --> 07:28.455
Just spoke to him.

07:28.455 --> 07:29.861
Get to it.

07:29.861 --> 07:31.396
Your flight is booked,
leaves in 55 minutes.

07:31.396 --> 07:32.547
Ed will be joining you.

07:32.547 --> 07:33.857
Where's Steve?

07:33.857 --> 07:35.775
He went home sick
about an hour ago, sir.

07:35.775 --> 07:37.118
I'll be filling in.

07:37.118 --> 07:38.493
What's your name again?
Edward what?

07:38.493 --> 07:40.315
- Meacham.
- You drive fast, Meacham?

07:51.728 --> 07:53.198
You wanted to talk to me?

07:53.198 --> 07:55.756
Come on, Zoe.
This is Mrs. Tilden, owner of--

07:55.756 --> 07:57.514
She knows who I am.

07:57.514 --> 08:00.071
Mrs. Tilden liked your profile
on Catherine Durant.

08:00.071 --> 08:02.757
No, I didn't.
I loved it.

08:02.757 --> 08:05.059
In depth, uncompromising.

08:05.059 --> 08:07.168
Normally I don't read things
before they go to print,

08:07.200 --> 08:08.863
but Cathy's a friend.

08:08.863 --> 08:12.571
Tell me how you knew she'd be
nominated before she did?

08:12.571 --> 08:13.690
You want my source?

08:13.690 --> 08:15.384
Tom says you won't tell him.

08:15.384 --> 08:16.439
I haven't told anyone.

08:16.439 --> 08:17.814
Well, I own the paper.

08:17.814 --> 08:20.148
And I'm very grateful
to be working here.

08:20.148 --> 08:21.874
So you're not going to tell
me either.

08:21.874 --> 08:24.176
Which do you want,
my source or my integrity?

08:27.596 --> 08:29.418
Tom.

08:31.049 --> 08:35.013
Move Zoe's piece to the front
page of Sunday's edition.

08:35.013 --> 08:36.227
Let me think that over.

08:36.227 --> 08:38.178
You think it over
as much as you want.

08:38.178 --> 08:39.616
Then put it on the front page.

08:49.335 --> 08:52.020
I've worked really hard to gain
a foothold with world well.

08:52.020 --> 08:54.833
Six years ago it was just
me and a macbook.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.496
I understand.

08:56.496 --> 08:58.382
And I had to juggle two
temp jobs just to pay the rent.

08:58.382 --> 09:00.716
It's your baby.
You don't want to let it go.

09:00.716 --> 09:02.794
Well, I just--

09:02.794 --> 09:06.502
And you wouldn't have to,
Gillian.

09:06.502 --> 09:10.018
All I want is for you to grow
what you've already built.

09:10.018 --> 09:11.329
I heard you fired
half your staff.

09:11.361 --> 09:12.800
Yes, I did.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.750
That worries me.

09:14.750 --> 09:18.650
I let them go to make room
for you.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.111
I'm just not sure
we're the right match.

09:21.111 --> 09:23.221
To be honest,
I'm a little uncomfortable

09:23.221 --> 09:25.395
working with someone who's
commissioning famous photographers

09:25.395 --> 09:29.072
when I can't even buy my
volunteers bus fair to the office.

09:29.072 --> 09:30.862
Do you know
who Nicky Hemler is?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.396
No.

09:32.396 --> 09:34.954
Nicky owns one of the
biggest galleries in Chelsea.

09:34.954 --> 09:38.278
She desperately wanted
to represent Adam Galloway.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.589
I delivered on Adam,

09:39.589 --> 09:40.996
and in return she contributes

09:40.996 --> 09:43.553
almost 40 grand a year to CWI.

09:43.553 --> 09:45.695
That money goes
to impact studies,

09:45.695 --> 09:48.189
lobbying efforts, research.

09:48.189 --> 09:51.194
World well could benefit from
that sort of money, Gillian,

09:51.194 --> 09:54.678
and we can benefit
from your expertise.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.250
Can I think about it?

10:00.497 --> 10:02.255
Of course.

10:02.255 --> 10:04.109
We don't have to jump
into anything.

10:04.109 --> 10:06.347
I grew up here,
in the up country--

10:06.347 --> 10:09.320
Bibles, barbecues,
and broken backs.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.302
Everything gets
just a little bit thicker

10:11.302 --> 10:12.708
this far south--

10:12.708 --> 10:15.394
The air, the blood, even me.

10:15.394 --> 10:17.600
I try to make it down here
at least once a month.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.413
Every trip is a reminder
of how far I've come.

10:20.413 --> 10:22.139
I hated Gaffney as a kid,

10:22.139 --> 10:23.706
when I had nothing,

10:23.706 --> 10:26.199
but now I've come
to appreciate it.

10:26.199 --> 10:28.213
It's not as suffocating
as it once was,

10:28.213 --> 10:29.939
except when I have to deal
with the sort of nonsense

10:29.939 --> 10:31.410
that makes me want
to hang myself.

10:31.410 --> 10:33.200
Turn left on route one--

10:33.200 --> 10:34.639
Don't listen to her.
I know a better way.

10:34.639 --> 10:35.854
Yes, sir.

10:35.854 --> 10:37.132
We don't have the money, Frank.

10:37.132 --> 10:39.498
The legal bills alone
will kill us.

10:39.498 --> 10:41.320
How about a settlement?

10:41.320 --> 10:43.558
I'll look at the numbers.

10:43.558 --> 10:45.188
What's it look like to you?

10:45.188 --> 10:46.595
Like a peach.

10:46.595 --> 10:49.664
No, I mean what does it
really look like?

10:51.198 --> 10:53.532
As mayor, I stick with a peach.

10:53.532 --> 10:54.907
As a private citizen,

10:54.907 --> 10:57.592
well, it looks like the sun
is shining

10:57.592 --> 10:58.871
where it shouldn't be.

11:00.981 --> 11:02.931
There's a
better way to handle this.

11:02.931 --> 11:05.584
Really, Frank?
And what's that?

11:05.584 --> 11:07.598
I'm not trying to start
an argument here.

11:07.598 --> 11:09.676
You make it sound
like I'm in the wrong.

11:09.676 --> 11:12.298
No, you know exactly
what you're doing, Orrin.

11:12.298 --> 11:13.960
You're using
this poor girl's death

11:13.960 --> 11:15.079
for your own political
advantage.

11:15.079 --> 11:16.390
You're the one that fought me

11:16.390 --> 11:17.413
when the peach farmers
bitched and moaned

11:17.413 --> 11:18.659
about me tearing it down.

11:18.659 --> 11:20.066
You're the one
that took their money.

11:20.066 --> 11:21.856
- It's a water tower.
- It's ungodly.

11:21.856 --> 11:23.295
- Orrin.
- This is cut and dry, Frank.

11:23.295 --> 11:25.053
I fought to tear it down.

11:25.053 --> 11:26.492
You fought to keep it up.

11:26.492 --> 11:28.825
That girl's blood
is on your hands,

11:28.825 --> 11:30.711
and I'm taking you
to task for it.

11:32.981 --> 11:34.356
All right, I'll tell you what.

11:34.356 --> 11:37.361
Dick Peters is going
to retire this term.

11:37.361 --> 11:40.334
That means there's an open
race in the fourth district.

11:40.334 --> 11:42.060
How about I help you
lock up that seat?

11:42.060 --> 11:44.298
I'm not looking to make
a deal, Frank.

11:44.298 --> 11:45.960
It's not a deal.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.463
It's an opportunity.

11:49.381 --> 11:50.852
I'll be just fine.

11:53.025 --> 11:55.551
You may despise me, Orrin,

11:55.551 --> 11:56.798
but the classy thing to do

11:56.798 --> 11:57.821
would've been to invite us up

11:57.821 --> 11:59.515
for some of that iced tea.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.612
What are you doing?

12:40.499 --> 12:41.777
You shouldn't run here.

12:41.777 --> 12:43.504
It's disgraceful.

12:43.504 --> 12:45.582
Have you no respect?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.535
The criteria
is a starting point.

13:08.535 --> 13:09.910
They're suggested,
not mandated.

13:09.910 --> 13:11.668
We assemble
a council of experts

13:11.668 --> 13:13.202
who will determine exactly--

13:13.202 --> 13:15.376
Nowhere here does it say
who these experts are,

13:15.376 --> 13:16.655
how they'll be chosen.

13:16.655 --> 13:18.157
The president selects
the council.

13:18.157 --> 13:19.436
What sort of oversight?

13:19.436 --> 13:20.747
We'd like input
on the selection.

13:20.747 --> 13:21.962
Doug, check with Linda.

13:21.962 --> 13:23.560
Calling her now.

13:23.560 --> 13:27.940
Okay, so now can we talk
about charter schools?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.155
Charter schools are a no-go.

13:29.155 --> 13:30.273
They have to be in there.

13:30.273 --> 13:31.392
You keep them in, we walk.

13:31.392 --> 13:32.479
The same goes for us.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.301
Let's not jump to ultimatums.

13:34.301 --> 13:36.955
Well, let's figure out a way
to reduce non-public spending.

13:36.955 --> 13:38.681
All right, give me a few
minutes to think about that.

13:38.681 --> 13:41.175
We can't move forward
without addressing this point.

13:41.175 --> 13:44.180
- I understand, but this is the cornerstone of the bill.
- Let's talk it out.

13:44.180 --> 13:46.417
Give me five minutes, Marty.
I'll call you right back.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.016
No-- no--

13:48.016 --> 13:49.614
If we consider
settlement as an option,

13:49.614 --> 13:50.957
we need to be able
to pay for it.

13:50.957 --> 13:52.555
But if we offer a settlement,

13:52.555 --> 13:54.601
- aren't we saying--
- That's my point.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.200
We're admitting that
the town's responsible

13:56.200 --> 13:57.542
for this kid's death.

13:57.542 --> 13:59.716
I say make the peach farmers
cough it up.

13:59.716 --> 14:01.283
Oh, man, talk about
a shit storm.

14:01.283 --> 14:02.753
Y'all mind catchin' me up?

14:02.753 --> 14:04.544
Wayne and Travis
want to go to court.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.142
I don't think
that's a good idea.

14:06.142 --> 14:07.932
We can't be pouring
money into a settlement

14:07.964 --> 14:09.403
when we can barely afford
to run the city.

14:09.403 --> 14:11.161
What do you think, gene?

14:11.161 --> 14:14.230
I think that we gotta worry about
the peach farmers association.

14:14.230 --> 14:16.532
If there is a hint that
we're blaming the Peachoid,

14:16.564 --> 14:17.938
they're going to raise
holy hell.

14:17.938 --> 14:19.793
Who gives a crap.
They gotta suck it up.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.199
Let him talk.

14:22.861 --> 14:26.218
I'm just saying that we need
to keep them in mind.

14:26.218 --> 14:27.912
She was breaking the law.
End of story.

14:27.912 --> 14:29.223
You can't text while you drive.

14:29.223 --> 14:30.822
Yeah, but all
a jury's going to see

14:30.822 --> 14:33.187
is a beautiful 17-year-old
girl who's now dead.

14:33.187 --> 14:34.946
No offense, Frank,
but you just got here.

14:34.946 --> 14:36.736
We've been dealing with this
for the last week now.

14:36.736 --> 14:38.238
And where's your solution?

14:38.238 --> 14:39.581
What?

14:39.581 --> 14:40.828
You think you know
better than us?

14:40.828 --> 14:42.618
I'm just trying to be
realistic.

14:42.618 --> 14:44.312
Frank, I know you want
to swoop down

14:44.312 --> 14:45.655
and save the day,

14:45.655 --> 14:47.349
but there's a principle
at stake here.

14:47.349 --> 14:49.044
We allow ourselves
to be extorted

14:49.044 --> 14:50.386
because of this teenager--

14:50.386 --> 14:51.793
When Orrin gets a jury to weep
a river of snot

14:51.793 --> 14:52.752
over this dead girl,

14:52.752 --> 14:54.574
when Gaffney goes tits up

14:54.574 --> 14:57.004
because you can't afford to pay a
seven-figure award in damages,

14:57.004 --> 14:58.442
when you all get booted
out of office

14:58.442 --> 14:59.817
and I lose to Chase,

14:59.817 --> 15:01.863
then you can chew my ear off
about principles,

15:01.863 --> 15:04.964
because we'll all have
nothing but time on our hands.

15:04.964 --> 15:06.339
Until then,

15:06.339 --> 15:07.394
you either contribute,

15:07.394 --> 15:08.672
or you keep it shut, Travis.

15:08.672 --> 15:09.983
Now, here's
what we're going to do.

15:09.983 --> 15:11.453
Gene, how much
can we pull together

15:11.485 --> 15:13.084
- for a settlement if we had to?
- About 150.

15:13.084 --> 15:14.554
That'll work.

15:14.554 --> 15:15.673
Jamie, get your boys down
to the hardware store

15:15.673 --> 15:17.144
to build two billboards.

15:17.144 --> 15:18.902
Put them out a mile out on
either side of the tower.

15:18.902 --> 15:21.396
Have them read, "drive safely.
No texting behind the wheel."

15:21.396 --> 15:22.898
- Got it.
- And get those up by tomorrow morning.

15:22.898 --> 15:24.337
I'll issue the permits.

15:24.337 --> 15:26.670
And let's stop lighting
the thing at night.

15:26.670 --> 15:28.109
The peach farmers
aren't going to like that.

15:28.109 --> 15:29.676
Well, how much does
the electric cost?

15:29.676 --> 15:32.105
4,100 plus change per month.

15:32.105 --> 15:33.704
About 50,000 a year.

15:33.704 --> 15:37.124
Jesus, you could put
a kid through college on--

15:37.124 --> 15:40.065
Let's use that money to start
a scholarship fund in her name.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.696
Meantime, you tell
the association,

15:41.696 --> 15:43.518
if they want it lit up,
they can pay for it.

15:43.518 --> 15:45.084
I'll deliver
that message happily.

15:45.084 --> 15:46.779
And do me up a budget
and a plan

15:46.779 --> 15:47.898
for removing the sphincter.

15:47.898 --> 15:48.952
The what?

15:48.952 --> 15:50.775
He means the emergency valve.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.117
That's interesting.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.035
I always thought
of it as a clitoris.

15:54.035 --> 15:55.666
But it's on bottom.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.552
I believe the clitoris
is above the--

15:57.552 --> 15:59.694
But if you imagine a woman
on her belly--

15:59.726 --> 16:02.987
Enough. I want it done.

16:02.987 --> 16:06.759
And, gene, give me everything
you've got on road regulations.

16:06.759 --> 16:08.901
County statutes, not municipal.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.563
And do you remember
that power line business

16:10.563 --> 16:11.746
we pulled up
at the last election?

16:11.746 --> 16:13.217
Sure do.

16:13.217 --> 16:15.454
Let's make sure
we're rock solid on that.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.875
Does this very expensive dinner

16:18.875 --> 16:20.026
at least buy me an evening

16:20.026 --> 16:21.912
of mind-blowing
sexual congress?

16:21.912 --> 16:24.533
It was good, but I don't know
if it was that good.

16:24.565 --> 16:25.620
Fellatio good?

16:25.620 --> 16:29.201
Hand job maybe.
No promises.

16:29.201 --> 16:31.151
Deal.

16:31.151 --> 16:34.667
Okay, um, Peter, there's
something I need to tell you.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.864
I have been thinking lately.

16:37.864 --> 16:41.285
You know, um, it might be good
to work somewhere else.

16:41.285 --> 16:42.883
So I did some interviews,

16:42.883 --> 16:45.920
and the speaker's office
offered me deputy LD.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.866
Peter.

16:51.866 --> 16:53.017
Christina, um--

16:53.017 --> 16:54.264
I just thought
it could be good, right,

16:54.264 --> 16:55.958
if we're going to have
any future,

16:55.958 --> 16:57.557
to stop this
boss-staffer thing

16:57.557 --> 16:58.548
and be a real couple.

16:58.548 --> 17:00.114
We are a real couple.

17:00.114 --> 17:03.503
I mean not have to hide it
like we do at the office.

17:03.503 --> 17:05.388
And it's a great opportunity.

17:05.388 --> 17:07.755
The speaker?

17:07.755 --> 17:10.760
Would you hate me
if I took the job?

17:14.084 --> 17:18.271
Baby, I want what you want.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.031
I'm not--
I won't fight you on this,

17:20.031 --> 17:23.259
not if this is what
you feel you need to do.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.538
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:24.538 --> 17:26.137
And you're right.

17:26.137 --> 17:27.191
This is a great opportunity.

17:27.191 --> 17:28.982
When do you have
to tell them by?

17:28.982 --> 17:31.283
There's no deadline.
I don't have to decide right away.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.626
Okay, well, when you decide,

17:32.626 --> 17:35.663
just, you know, help me find
a replacement.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.070
You know, give me a heads-up.

17:37.070 --> 17:38.508
Yeah, of course.

17:38.508 --> 17:41.322
I haven't even decided
if I'm going to take it.

17:41.322 --> 17:42.856
We don't have to talk this
through right now.

17:42.856 --> 17:44.518
I just-- I just thought
I'd bring it up.

17:50.464 --> 17:51.551
Should we get out of here?

17:51.551 --> 17:52.638
Yes.

18:04.243 --> 18:06.832
Let's go find the parents.

18:06.832 --> 18:08.239
You hang back by the car.

18:08.239 --> 18:10.189
It's a big crowd, sir.

18:11.244 --> 18:13.354
If I get shot or stabbed

18:13.354 --> 18:14.920
consoling two grieving parents,

18:14.920 --> 18:17.542
I'm a hero from now
until the end of time.

18:17.542 --> 18:19.364
Let's roll the dice.
Shall we?

18:19.364 --> 18:20.515
Sir, I can't allow you
to go unescorted

18:20.515 --> 18:22.017
into all those people.

18:25.630 --> 18:26.940
Allow me?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.699
Let's get one thing
straight, Meacham.

18:28.699 --> 18:31.896
You are never to dictate
what I can and cannot do.

18:31.928 --> 18:33.878
The only two words
I want to hear from you

18:33.878 --> 18:35.060
when I ask you to do something

18:35.060 --> 18:36.659
are "yes" and "sir."

18:36.659 --> 18:38.225
Is that understood?

18:38.225 --> 18:39.696
Yes, sir.

18:39.728 --> 18:42.317
Good. Then we're gonna
get along just fine.

18:52.547 --> 18:57.151
Mr. and Mrs. masters, I'm Frank
Underwood, your congressman.

18:57.151 --> 19:00.284
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:00.284 --> 19:01.754
I cannot begin to fathom--

19:01.754 --> 19:04.216
You're right. You can't.
You have no idea.

19:04.248 --> 19:06.837
Forgive me.
I don't mean to intrude. I just--

19:06.837 --> 19:08.819
- Well, you are intruding.
- Dean, please.

19:08.819 --> 19:09.906
What?

19:09.906 --> 19:11.057
It's his fault.
Isn't it?

19:12.432 --> 19:13.998
Anyway, I just wanted
to express my condolences,

19:13.998 --> 19:15.596
and say if there's anything
the two of you nee--

19:15.596 --> 19:18.442
Dean, you don't want to be
talking to him.

19:18.442 --> 19:20.072
We got legal action pending.

19:20.072 --> 19:22.406
Look, I know what Mr. Chase
has been saying, and believe--

19:22.406 --> 19:23.780
Nobody invited you.

19:23.780 --> 19:25.155
Nobody wants your condolences

19:25.155 --> 19:26.146
or your excuses.

19:26.146 --> 19:28.096
Frank, please.

19:31.197 --> 19:32.955
You shouldn't have to put up
with this right now.

19:33.786 --> 19:35.001
I'm sorry.

19:39.797 --> 19:41.043
Well, that went well.

19:44.272 --> 19:46.766
Hang on a second.
Reverend.

19:47.789 --> 19:49.003
Congressman.

19:49.003 --> 19:50.666
Nice to see you again.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.840
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

19:52.840 --> 19:53.799
Terrible, isn't it?

19:53.799 --> 19:55.365
It's just terrible.

19:55.365 --> 19:57.187
This is so thoughtful
what you've organized here.

19:57.187 --> 19:58.626
Least we can do.

19:58.626 --> 20:01.247
Tell me, are the masters
in your congregation?

20:01.247 --> 20:03.645
They are.
They come every Sunday.

20:03.645 --> 20:05.947
Do you think they'll be
at the service tomorrow?

20:05.947 --> 20:07.481
I'd be surprised
if they weren't.

20:07.481 --> 20:10.262
I'm wondering.
Can you do me a favor?

20:10.262 --> 20:12.660
Anything for you, Frank.

20:40.121 --> 20:42.231
Oh, the blue toothbrush
is yours, right?

20:42.231 --> 20:44.341
Uh, yeah, the blue one.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.360
- Hey, Peter?
- Yeah?

20:49.360 --> 20:50.926
Where do you keep
the light bulbs?

20:50.926 --> 20:52.205
The lamp in the bedroom is out.

20:52.205 --> 20:53.995
In the kitchen, under the sink.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.577
Here's what I think.

21:36.609 --> 21:38.048
I wish I could be bigger
than this, but I can't,

21:38.048 --> 21:40.701
and I'm being selfish,

21:40.701 --> 21:43.578
and I realize it's mostly
about me, but fuck it.

21:43.578 --> 21:47.351
I have to say it. Please don't
take that other job, Christina.

21:53.872 --> 21:55.566
Anyway, that's how I feel.

21:56.909 --> 21:58.380
I'm glad you told me.

22:03.623 --> 22:07.555
Charters jeopardize
our ability to organize,

22:07.555 --> 22:09.185
which is reason enough,

22:09.185 --> 22:10.272
but the bigger issue is

22:10.272 --> 22:11.327
that measuring their success--

22:11.327 --> 22:12.829
Charters schools have operated

22:12.829 --> 22:13.980
under the same evaluative
standards that every--

22:13.980 --> 22:16.122
Apples and oranges.

22:16.122 --> 22:19.223
No matter how you look at it, you can't
use the same standards to compare.

22:19.223 --> 22:22.036
What, you're advocating a more
demanding criteria for charter schools

22:22.036 --> 22:23.922
- than other schools--
- Our point is simple, Frank.

22:23.922 --> 22:25.745
Several funds should only go

22:25.745 --> 22:29.069
- to public union school districts
- Hold on a second.

22:29.069 --> 22:31.659
Yeah, but we've already increased
non-charter funding by 10%.

22:31.691 --> 22:33.865
The amount going to charter
schools is negligible.

22:33.865 --> 22:36.390
It's the precedent, Frank,
not the number.

22:36.390 --> 22:38.021
We're setting a lot
of precedents, Marty.

22:38.021 --> 22:39.779
That's the nature of reform.

22:39.811 --> 22:42.912
Well, some of them we can stomach.
Some of them we can't.

22:42.912 --> 22:44.638
All right, let's not get
bogged down in abstractions.

22:44.638 --> 22:45.917
Let's deal with specifics.

22:45.917 --> 22:48.442
Corey, can you walk us
through it?

22:48.442 --> 22:49.721
There's a three-prong approach

22:49.721 --> 22:51.383
to determining
the amount of funding...

22:54.420 --> 22:55.379
Miss me?

22:55.379 --> 22:56.786
Maybe. A little.

22:56.786 --> 22:58.608
What's it been, 15 hours?

22:59.951 --> 23:02.636
Not even long enough
to notice you're gone.

23:02.636 --> 23:04.267
Tell that to Marty Spinella.

23:04.267 --> 23:05.513
How's it coming?

23:05.513 --> 23:08.870
It's coming.
Slowly, painfully.

23:08.870 --> 23:11.587
Hey, have we always had
tulips in the front yard,

23:11.587 --> 23:13.506
or am I slowly going insane?

23:13.506 --> 23:15.072
I planted them last fall.

23:15.072 --> 23:16.479
You did not.

23:16.479 --> 23:19.004
When I was down with you
for the campaign.

23:19.004 --> 23:21.913
You've never gardened
a day in your life.

23:21.913 --> 23:25.462
Not true. I have gardened
exactly one day in my life.

23:25.462 --> 23:26.996
You were down in Spartanburg

23:26.996 --> 23:28.627
doing some sort of fundraiser.

23:28.627 --> 23:31.440
Gene's wife came over
with a bucket of bulbs,

23:31.440 --> 23:34.221
and next thing you knew, I was
down on my knees in the dirt,

23:34.221 --> 23:35.436
earthworms and all.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.432
I can't even picture it.

23:39.432 --> 23:40.870
Neither can I, and I was there.

23:40.870 --> 23:42.885
What else?

23:42.885 --> 23:45.026
Distract me from giant
peaches and dead teenagers.

23:45.026 --> 23:46.944
What else?

23:46.944 --> 23:51.196
Oh, I went for a run today,

23:51.196 --> 23:53.146
and the strangest...

23:56.951 --> 23:58.038
I-- I don't know.

23:58.038 --> 23:59.348
This woman...

24:03.312 --> 24:04.527
That's interesting.

24:04.527 --> 24:05.646
What is?

24:05.646 --> 24:08.204
Oh, a text just came.
Zoe Barnes.

24:08.204 --> 24:09.930
Who?

24:09.930 --> 24:13.606
Oh, that reporter from
the herald you met one night.

24:13.606 --> 24:14.917
Oh, her.
I remember.

24:14.917 --> 24:16.483
Yeah, go if you need
to call her back.

24:16.483 --> 24:17.890
No, she can wait.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.488
I'm talking to my wife.

24:19.488 --> 24:21.406
That's okay.
I'm going to bed soon anyway.

24:21.406 --> 24:22.621
See you tomorrow?

24:22.621 --> 24:23.868
I hope so.

24:23.868 --> 24:25.243
Wish me luck.

24:28.631 --> 24:31.636
Mm, bonsoir,
my petite Peachoid.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.755
Disgusting.

24:32.755 --> 24:34.865
- Good night.
- Good night.

24:34.865 --> 24:36.943
Yeah, all right, that's fine, Corey.
Marty?

24:36.943 --> 24:39.309
Frank, let me explain it to you.
Here's our problem.

25:47.785 --> 25:50.119
Frank? Frank,
did we lose you?

25:50.119 --> 25:51.877
Uh, yeah, I'm here, Marty.

25:51.877 --> 25:54.690
Look, we can talk ourselves in
circles about charter schools,

25:54.690 --> 25:56.193
but here's what I propose.

25:56.193 --> 25:58.910
In your profile,
you go into great detail

25:58.910 --> 26:01.468
about the sexism Durant faced
early on in her career.

26:01.468 --> 26:02.587
That's right.

26:02.587 --> 26:04.025
When she was first elected,

26:04.025 --> 26:06.231
it was still an old boy's club
in the senate.

26:06.231 --> 26:09.332
Journalism used to be that
way, too, not so long ago.

26:09.332 --> 26:10.962
I feel really lucky.

26:10.962 --> 26:14.319
I've had lots of trailblazers
come before me.

26:14.319 --> 26:16.525
For instance, my colleague
Janine Skorsky

26:16.525 --> 26:18.155
was the first woman
at the herald

26:18.155 --> 26:19.754
to become chief political
correspondent,

26:19.754 --> 26:21.064
and that was
only five years ago.

26:21.064 --> 26:22.599
Has it been those trailblazers

26:22.599 --> 26:24.229
who've allowed you
to rise so quickly?

26:24.229 --> 26:26.211
You've moved up
from the Metro pages

26:26.211 --> 26:28.161
to the front page
Sunday edition.

26:28.161 --> 26:31.646
Uh, well, I don't know
that that would be possible

26:31.646 --> 26:34.107
if Janine hadn't already
paved the way.

26:34.107 --> 26:36.921
So does that mean that the herald
is not particularly progressive?

26:36.921 --> 26:39.286
I think that they are.
Tom is very open minded.

26:39.286 --> 26:41.109
He's the reason Janine
got promoted.

26:41.109 --> 26:43.027
That's Tom Hammerschmidt,
the executive editor.

26:43.027 --> 26:45.328
Yes, we actually call him
the hammer.

26:45.328 --> 26:46.639
The hammer? Why?

26:46.639 --> 26:47.790
Because he's tough.

26:47.790 --> 26:49.229
How tough?

26:49.229 --> 26:52.329
He's, uh--
Tom has very high standards.

26:52.329 --> 26:53.512
I love him.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.398
He's a-- he's a great mentor.

26:55.398 --> 26:57.924
Um, it can be frustrating
at times.

26:57.924 --> 27:02.144
Um, he makes you double
and triple-check things,

27:02.144 --> 27:04.126
and you want to get
the news out

27:04.126 --> 27:05.596
the moment you have it,

27:05.596 --> 27:07.674
and he makes you rewrite
until it's perfect,

27:07.674 --> 27:09.784
but that's what makes
the herald the herald.

27:09.784 --> 27:12.502
Is that a workable model
in the Internet age?

27:12.533 --> 27:13.812
Our readers think it is.

27:13.812 --> 27:15.251
Well, you have
a declining readership.

27:15.251 --> 27:17.009
But I don't lay that
at Tom's feet.

27:17.009 --> 27:19.726
I think that that's the times
we live in, right?

27:19.726 --> 27:22.508
Should newspapers adapt
to the times we live in?

27:22.508 --> 27:25.353
It's not that the herald
refuses to adapt.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.079
We have an online presence.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.477
Is that maybe not adapting
fast enough?

27:29.477 --> 27:31.842
I wouldn't argue
with that statement.

27:31.842 --> 27:34.272
We could do more.

28:07.839 --> 28:10.077
We've got a special guest
with us today.

28:10.077 --> 28:13.146
He asked for the opportunity

28:13.146 --> 28:17.174
to share a few words
with us this morning--

28:17.174 --> 28:20.786
Our very own congressman,
Frank Underwood.

28:33.573 --> 28:35.651
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

28:35.651 --> 28:37.122
Thank you, reverend,

28:37.122 --> 28:39.264
and thanks to that choir
for that beautiful hymn.

28:39.264 --> 28:43.388
I want to read,
this morning, from...

28:54.992 --> 28:57.965
No.

28:57.965 --> 29:01.386
You know what no one
wants to talk about.

29:01.386 --> 29:02.761
Hate.

29:02.761 --> 29:04.647
I know all about hate.

29:04.647 --> 29:06.949
It starts in your gut,

29:06.949 --> 29:09.122
deep down here,

29:09.122 --> 29:11.360
where it stirs and churns.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.310
And then it rises.

29:13.310 --> 29:16.283
Hate rises fast and volcanic.

29:16.283 --> 29:18.489
It erupts hot on the breath.

29:18.489 --> 29:20.695
Your eyes go wide with fire.

29:20.695 --> 29:22.325
You clench your teeth so hard

29:22.325 --> 29:24.851
you think they'll shatter.

29:24.851 --> 29:29.199
I hate you, God. I hate you!

29:32.907 --> 29:35.113
Oh, don't tell me you haven't
said those words before.

29:35.113 --> 29:36.072
I know you have.

29:36.072 --> 29:38.885
We all have,

29:38.885 --> 29:44.224
if you've ever felt
so crushing a loss.

29:44.256 --> 29:46.813
There are two parents
with us today

29:46.813 --> 29:49.307
who know that pain,

29:50.585 --> 29:53.207
the most terrible hurt of all--

29:53.207 --> 29:56.084
Losing a child before her time.

29:56.084 --> 29:58.354
If Dean and leanne
were to stand up right now

29:58.354 --> 30:00.240
and scream those
awful words of hate,

30:00.240 --> 30:01.615
could we blame them?

30:01.615 --> 30:03.309
I couldn't.

30:03.309 --> 30:05.994
At least their hatred
I can understand.

30:05.994 --> 30:09.031
I can grasp it,

30:09.031 --> 30:11.493
but God's wantonness,

30:11.493 --> 30:13.922
his cruelty,

30:13.922 --> 30:16.863
I can't even begin to--

30:21.755 --> 30:23.992
My father dropped dead
of a heart attack

30:23.992 --> 30:26.166
at the age of 43--
43 years old--

30:26.166 --> 30:28.404
and when he died,
I looked up to God

30:28.404 --> 30:29.907
and I said those words,

30:29.907 --> 30:32.240
because my father was so young,

30:32.240 --> 30:34.894
so full of life,
so full of dreams.

30:34.894 --> 30:38.666
Why would God take him from us?

30:38.666 --> 30:40.264
Truth be told,
I never really knew him

30:40.296 --> 30:41.479
or what his dreams were.

30:41.479 --> 30:43.557
He was quiet, timid,
almost invisible.

30:43.557 --> 30:44.836
My mother didn't think
much of him.

30:44.836 --> 30:46.274
My mother's mother hated him.

30:46.274 --> 30:48.544
The man never scratched
the surface of life.

30:48.576 --> 30:49.951
Maybe it's best he died
so young.

30:49.951 --> 30:51.965
He wasn't doing much
but taking up space.

30:51.965 --> 30:55.066
But that doesn't make for a very
powerful eulogy, now, does it?

30:55.098 --> 30:58.518
I wept.
I screamed, "why, God?

30:58.518 --> 31:01.491
How can I not hate you

31:01.491 --> 31:02.834
when you steal from me

31:02.834 --> 31:04.816
the person I most love

31:04.816 --> 31:07.086
and admire in this world?

31:09.228 --> 31:12.169
I don't understand it,
and I hate you for it."

31:16.804 --> 31:18.275
The Bible says

31:18.275 --> 31:19.873
in proverbs,

31:19.873 --> 31:23.933
"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

31:23.933 --> 31:28.121
and lean not on
your own understanding."

31:28.121 --> 31:31.606
Lean not on your
own understanding.

31:31.606 --> 31:34.227
God is telling us to trust him,

31:34.227 --> 31:37.072
to love him despite
our own ignorance.

31:38.671 --> 31:41.068
After all, what is faith

31:41.068 --> 31:44.521
if it doesn't endure
when we are tested the most?

31:49.604 --> 31:51.554
We will never understand

31:51.554 --> 31:53.856
why God took Jessica

31:53.856 --> 31:56.125
or my father or anyone.

31:56.125 --> 31:58.971
And while God may not
give us any answers,

31:58.971 --> 32:03.191
he has given us
the capacity for love.

32:03.191 --> 32:06.164
Our job is to love him

32:06.164 --> 32:09.328
without questioning his plan.

32:09.328 --> 32:12.973
So I pray to you, dear Lord,

32:12.973 --> 32:14.156
I pray to you

32:14.156 --> 32:16.969
to help strengthen
our love for your

32:16.969 --> 32:20.485
and to embrace Dean and leanne

32:20.485 --> 32:24.290
with the warmth of your love
in return.

32:24.290 --> 32:28.254
And I pray that you will
help us fend off hatred

32:28.254 --> 32:32.633
so that we may all truly
trust in you

32:32.633 --> 32:34.647
with all our hearts

32:34.647 --> 32:38.867
and lean not on
our own understanding.

32:40.082 --> 32:41.393
Amen.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.927
Amen.

32:42.927 --> 32:45.325
Your job is to report
the news, not be the news.

32:45.325 --> 32:46.412
I was promoting the paper.

32:46.412 --> 32:48.042
You were promoting Zoe Barnes.

32:48.042 --> 32:50.120
Is this about how I said
we called you the hammer?

32:50.120 --> 32:52.230
- Because if that upset you, I apologize.
- You're missing the point.

32:52.230 --> 32:55.075
I don't want you talking about
anything that happens here,

32:55.075 --> 32:57.281
not nicknames,
not how progressive we are,

32:57.281 --> 32:59.199
not whether we are adapting
to the Internet.

32:59.199 --> 33:00.925
Any thoughts you have
about this paper,

33:00.925 --> 33:02.684
you keep them to yourself,
or you bring them to me.

33:02.684 --> 33:04.090
You don't get on national
television and sp--

33:04.090 --> 33:05.593
I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying to--

33:05.593 --> 33:07.799
Don't interrupt
when I'm talking.

33:07.799 --> 33:09.877
You can speak to me
like an adult, Tom.

33:09.877 --> 33:11.731
You don't have to lecture me
like a little girl.

33:11.731 --> 33:15.088
You haven't earned the right
to be treated as an adult.

33:15.088 --> 33:17.453
You think a few front-page
stories and some face time on TV

33:17.453 --> 33:19.435
makes you the next Judy Miller?

33:19.435 --> 33:20.522
You've got a long way to go.

33:20.522 --> 33:22.440
Don't be so arrogant.

33:22.440 --> 33:26.756
Okay, so you think when a woman
asks to be treated with respect,

33:26.756 --> 33:28.163
that's arrogance?

33:28.163 --> 33:30.400
Are you accusing me of sexism?

33:30.400 --> 33:32.031
Just making an observation.

33:32.031 --> 33:33.725
No TV for a month.

33:33.725 --> 33:35.164
- What?
- You heard me.

33:35.164 --> 33:36.698
No interviews.

33:36.698 --> 33:38.009
That's completely unfair.

33:38.009 --> 33:40.119
You want to make it
no TV indefinitely?

33:42.165 --> 33:44.850
We're done.
You can go now.

34:07.292 --> 34:09.849
Hello?

34:09.849 --> 34:12.695
Gillian, it's Claire Underwood.
Can I come up?

34:21.838 --> 34:24.043
Have you seen a doctor?

34:24.043 --> 34:25.994
Giardia's not so bad.

34:25.994 --> 34:29.350
It'll pass in another
week or so.

34:29.350 --> 34:30.565
You don't have
health insurance, do you?

34:30.565 --> 34:32.610
Nope.

34:32.610 --> 34:35.136
I'll make an appointment for you
to see my personal GP tomorrow.

34:35.136 --> 34:36.799
Medicine doesn't
really do much.

34:36.799 --> 34:38.717
You have to let it run
its course.

34:38.717 --> 34:41.274
Well, we'll let it run its
course under proper supervision.

34:41.274 --> 34:43.129
I won't take no
for an answer on this.

34:43.129 --> 34:44.375
- Claire--
- I'll drag you to the hospital myself

34:44.375 --> 34:45.686
if I have to.

34:45.686 --> 34:48.052
You're going to the doctor.
No argument.

34:49.873 --> 34:51.728
Thanks.

34:51.728 --> 34:54.126
They're about to walk.
They won't listen to a word I say.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.724
- Both unions?
- Yeah.

34:55.724 --> 34:56.971
Put Marty on the phone.

34:56.971 --> 34:57.994
Hang on.

34:57.994 --> 34:59.401
Marty.

34:59.401 --> 35:02.597
Yeah. It's Frank?

35:04.739 --> 35:06.242
This isn't working, Frank.

35:06.242 --> 35:08.799
Marty, you have got to keep
them in that room.

35:08.799 --> 35:10.238
They lost their patience.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.092
They're upset you're not
in the room, Frank.

35:12.092 --> 35:14.202
- I'll be back this afternoon.
- No, it's too late.

35:14.202 --> 35:18.709
Look, tell them I'll come down on
subsidies for charter schools.

35:18.709 --> 35:20.116
Even so,

35:20.116 --> 35:21.651
they're angry about
the performance standards.

35:21.651 --> 35:22.961
We're not even halfway
through this thing.

35:22.961 --> 35:24.720
There's so much in it
that they--

35:24.720 --> 35:26.510
Tell them that I'll roll over
on performance standards,

35:26.510 --> 35:28.971
five-year intervals.

35:28.971 --> 35:31.401
It should be you
telling them that, Frank,

35:31.401 --> 35:33.671
you here, at this table.

35:33.671 --> 35:35.653
I know that.
I'm doing the best I can,

35:35.653 --> 35:37.475
but I can't be
in two places at once.

35:37.475 --> 35:39.809
Now, look.
I promise you,

35:39.809 --> 35:41.247
if you keep them in that room,

35:41.247 --> 35:42.846
we will get through this hump

35:42.846 --> 35:45.691
as soon as I get back.

35:45.691 --> 35:48.760
Marty, you are their lobbyist.
You know what's best for them.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.030
Save them from themselves.

35:52.660 --> 35:54.099
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

35:57.295 --> 35:58.510
Stamper.

35:58.510 --> 36:00.780
Do not let Spinella
out of your sight

36:00.780 --> 36:03.273
and lock the goddamn doors
if you have to.

36:03.273 --> 36:05.032
You got it.

36:06.694 --> 36:08.356
Here we go.

36:08.356 --> 36:10.051
I know you're a busy man.
I hope we're not keeping you.

36:10.051 --> 36:11.969
No, no, no, I've got all
the time in the world.

36:11.969 --> 36:14.430
This is ham
and these are turkey.

36:14.430 --> 36:16.540
And there's some potato salad.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.650
Shall we have a prayer?

36:18.650 --> 36:19.993
Gracious loving God...

36:19.993 --> 36:21.527
Have you had this before?

36:21.527 --> 36:24.245
This is the third time.
I'm used to it by now.

36:24.245 --> 36:26.578
Well, I'm not used to it,
but it beats malaria.

36:26.578 --> 36:28.081
You've had malaria.

36:28.081 --> 36:29.168
In Zimbabwe.

36:29.168 --> 36:30.574
That took me out for a month.

36:30.574 --> 36:33.803
You make a lot of sacrifices.

36:33.803 --> 36:35.562
I don't see it as a sacrifice.

36:35.562 --> 36:37.735
You turned down
a six-figure salary at Google

36:37.735 --> 36:39.717
to start your own non-profit.

36:39.717 --> 36:42.115
People don't get malaria
in Palo Alto.

36:45.088 --> 36:46.591
You do your research.

36:46.591 --> 36:50.970
When it's someone I care about.

36:50.970 --> 36:54.934
Claire, I turned down that job
because I would've hated myself.

36:54.934 --> 36:56.916
It was a lot of money,
but for what?

36:56.916 --> 36:58.739
So they could fulfill
their diversity quota

36:58.739 --> 37:01.392
with an Asian girl
peddling a Stanford degree?

37:01.392 --> 37:02.575
Not just any Asian girl.

37:02.575 --> 37:05.004
A valedictorian.

37:05.004 --> 37:08.041
Let me offer you
what Google couldn't.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.352
I know what it is

37:09.352 --> 37:12.229
to be capable and beautiful
and ambitious

37:12.261 --> 37:14.723
and be on people like Sergey
and Larry's checklist

37:14.723 --> 37:16.417
of things that look good
to have on a shelf.

37:19.934 --> 37:22.235
I'm not trying
to acquisition you.

37:22.235 --> 37:25.720
What I see in you
is a woman I admire,

37:25.720 --> 37:27.095
which doesn't happen often.

37:28.821 --> 37:30.323
I want to enable you.

37:30.323 --> 37:32.242
I want to clear the way for you

37:32.242 --> 37:34.671
so that you can achieve
what you want to achieve,

37:34.671 --> 37:36.046
on your own terms.

37:38.284 --> 37:41.289
Thanks for the tea.

37:41.289 --> 37:44.613
And I will send a car to pick
you up for the doctor tomorrow.

37:44.613 --> 37:46.020
When you're back on your feet,

37:46.020 --> 37:48.098
do you think maybe we can work
something out?

37:53.117 --> 37:55.195
Yes, I think we could.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.766
That's her at junior prom.

38:01.525 --> 38:02.931
Beautiful.

38:06.736 --> 38:09.197
Here she is
in her letter jacket.

38:09.197 --> 38:13.257
She made varsity as a freshman.

38:13.257 --> 38:15.111
I remember the day
she found out.

38:15.111 --> 38:16.646
Coach called.

38:16.646 --> 38:19.299
Jessie starts jumping
up and down.

38:19.299 --> 38:21.697
"Mom, guess what?"

38:26.876 --> 38:27.995
I'm sorry.

38:27.995 --> 38:30.168
Don't be.
It's fine.

38:31.447 --> 38:32.502
Why are we doing this?

38:32.502 --> 38:34.740
Honestly, what's to be gained

38:34.740 --> 38:37.841
in dredging up all this stuff?

38:37.841 --> 38:39.439
Remembering the good things
helps sometimes--

38:39.439 --> 38:41.773
Not when it puts my wife
in tears.

38:43.116 --> 38:44.458
I appreciate what you said
at the church,

38:44.458 --> 38:45.833
but it doesn't do us any good.

38:45.833 --> 38:47.272
Neither does this.

38:47.272 --> 38:48.710
Well, what can I do to help?

38:48.742 --> 38:50.277
You can't do anything.

38:50.277 --> 38:51.875
She's gone.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.848
You're right.
I can't change that,

38:54.848 --> 38:56.574
but I can make sure

38:56.574 --> 38:59.579
the city offers you
a sizable settlement.

38:59.579 --> 39:01.178
You mean buy us off?

39:01.178 --> 39:04.854
No, I mean help you avoiding
years of court battles.

39:04.854 --> 39:06.580
Jessica was going
to go to Furman.

39:06.580 --> 39:08.658
Is that right?
On a volleyball scholarship?

39:08.658 --> 39:10.449
Yes, a full ride.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.878
Well, I spoke to the president
of the university this morning,

39:12.878 --> 39:14.605
and we'd like to create
a new scholarship

39:14.605 --> 39:15.691
in your daughter's name.

39:15.691 --> 39:16.938
If you'd like that.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.089
It's entirely up to you.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.039
But, most importantly,

39:20.039 --> 39:22.117
we have to make sure
that this never happens again.

39:22.117 --> 39:25.090
We've got safety billboards
going up,

39:25.090 --> 39:26.497
we're going to stop lighting
the tower at night,

39:26.497 --> 39:28.127
and we're putting
the guard rails in.

39:28.127 --> 39:31.516
Should've done all that
before she ran off the road.

39:31.516 --> 39:34.649
Would you like me to resign,
Mr. masters?

39:35.991 --> 39:37.718
Just say the word,
and it's done.

39:37.718 --> 39:40.051
If it will bring you
any satisfaction.

39:49.962 --> 39:51.816
I asked the reverend once,

39:51.816 --> 39:53.478
"What are we supposed to do

39:53.478 --> 39:56.643
in the face
of so much senseless pain?"

39:56.643 --> 39:58.529
And he said to me,

39:58.529 --> 40:00.447
"what else can we do

40:00.447 --> 40:02.781
but take what seems meaningless

40:02.781 --> 40:06.553
and try to make something
meaningful from it."

40:06.553 --> 40:08.216
He's right.

40:08.216 --> 40:11.636
That's how God works--

40:11.636 --> 40:13.554
Through us.

40:13.554 --> 40:16.463
Will you let me work for you?

40:22.601 --> 40:24.647
What you have to understand
about my people

40:24.647 --> 40:26.438
is that they are
a noble people.

40:26.438 --> 40:29.059
Humility is their form
of pride.

40:29.059 --> 40:32.160
It is their strength,
it is their weakness,

40:32.160 --> 40:36.316
and if you can humble
yourself before them,

40:36.316 --> 40:38.777
they will do anything you ask.

40:42.198 --> 40:44.276
Tell us more
about the scholarship.

41:08.124 --> 41:10.714
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:10.714 --> 41:11.993
What are you doing?

41:12.025 --> 41:13.847
- Working.
- On what?

41:13.847 --> 41:16.564
The, uh, BRAC commission stuff.

41:16.564 --> 41:18.514
I'm behind on it.

41:18.514 --> 41:20.592
It's Sunday.

41:20.624 --> 41:22.542
So?

41:22.542 --> 41:25.036
You don't usually work
on the weekend.

41:25.036 --> 41:26.634
Well, now I do.

41:26.634 --> 41:29.160
There's, uh, coffee in the kitchen.
You want some?

41:32.420 --> 41:33.795
Peter...

41:36.640 --> 41:37.727
Peter.

41:39.326 --> 41:40.956
If I decide to stay,

41:40.956 --> 41:43.290
it's because it's what I want,
not what you want.

41:47.957 --> 41:49.396
I understand.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.118
Which draft are you reading
of the written testimony?

41:55.118 --> 41:56.397
The one you sent on Thursday.

41:56.397 --> 41:58.635
I actually changed it
on Friday.

41:58.635 --> 42:00.073
Can I show you?

42:02.215 --> 42:05.540
Yeah, I was thinking that we
could start with job numbers

42:05.540 --> 42:07.362
and then go to
economic multipliers

42:07.362 --> 42:08.417
instead of
the other way around.

42:08.417 --> 42:10.015
What do you think?

42:10.015 --> 42:12.317
Let's see what it looks like.

42:29.804 --> 42:31.274
Picture this--

42:31.274 --> 42:32.553
A 17-year-old girl

42:32.585 --> 42:34.120
traveling at 60 miles an hour

42:34.120 --> 42:36.261
spins out of control
in no traffic.

42:36.261 --> 42:37.476
She hits a guard rail.

42:37.476 --> 42:39.682
But if she's wearing
her seatbelt,

42:39.682 --> 42:40.961
which she was,

42:40.961 --> 42:42.240
and her car doesn't roll
over three times

42:42.240 --> 42:44.413
down a 20-foot ditch,
which it did,

42:44.413 --> 42:46.331
then that young woman
is still alive.

42:47.450 --> 42:49.049
But you know what?

42:49.049 --> 42:51.894
The county administrator
didn't build those guard rails,

42:51.894 --> 42:53.492
so now she's dead.

42:53.492 --> 42:55.123
We looked up the statute.

42:55.123 --> 42:58.096
Guard rails are under
county supervision.

42:59.918 --> 43:02.092
Are you trying to turn this
around on me?

43:02.092 --> 43:03.115
That's not all, Orrin.

43:03.115 --> 43:04.649
Your easement.

43:04.649 --> 43:06.855
You see, every couple of years
the piedmont electric,

43:06.855 --> 43:08.997
they apply to bring power lines
through Gaffney.

43:08.997 --> 43:10.659
The route comes
right through your lot.

43:10.659 --> 43:12.130
Now, gene and I
always fight them off,

43:12.130 --> 43:14.464
but this year, if they
were to reapply, hmm...

43:14.464 --> 43:15.838
Eminent domain.

43:15.838 --> 43:17.277
It would be such a shame
to have to tear down

43:17.277 --> 43:18.300
this beautiful home.

43:18.300 --> 43:20.282
Fuck you, Frank.

43:20.282 --> 43:22.104
You can't just roll up
on my property

43:22.104 --> 43:23.287
and act like you own it.

43:28.849 --> 43:30.288
Oh, but I can.

43:30.288 --> 43:31.599
We just did.

43:34.604 --> 43:37.257
I've won this district
11 times.

43:37.257 --> 43:40.198
Do you think that's just luck
and a firm handshake?

43:40.198 --> 43:43.012
But I'll tell you what.
I'm not a vindictive person.

43:43.012 --> 43:45.569
I don't like for anybody
to lose if everybody can win,

43:45.569 --> 43:47.807
so I'm going to help you
get elected in the fourth.

43:47.807 --> 43:49.725
You get to keep your house.
I keep the fifth.

43:49.725 --> 43:52.378
We put the Peachoid behind us,
and everybody's happy.

43:52.378 --> 43:54.264
What do you say?

43:54.264 --> 43:55.575
Well, that's all right.
You think about it.

43:55.575 --> 43:57.525
I'm sure you'll do
the right thing.

43:57.525 --> 44:00.402
Oh, and I'm looking forward to
having you in congress, Orrin.

44:00.402 --> 44:03.375
It's always good to have friends
on the other side of the aisle.

44:23.292 --> 44:25.561
I've been offered a spot
on Nightline.

44:25.561 --> 44:27.639
You want my advice?

44:27.639 --> 44:29.494
I don't want it.
I need it.

44:29.494 --> 44:31.060
Close your eyes.

44:32.946 --> 44:34.417
Okay.

44:34.417 --> 44:37.646
It's 11:25.
Nightline is about to come on.

44:37.646 --> 44:39.692
Millions of people
are watching.

44:39.692 --> 44:41.098
Where are you, home?

44:41.098 --> 44:42.984
No.

44:42.984 --> 44:44.327
At the studio?

44:44.327 --> 44:45.734
Yes.

44:45.734 --> 44:47.236
And what do you see?

44:47.268 --> 44:49.090
I see lights.

44:49.090 --> 44:50.305
I see a camera.

44:50.305 --> 44:52.383
And that little red dot
goes on.

44:52.383 --> 44:54.621
Tell me what you hear?

44:54.621 --> 44:56.219
I hear my voice.

44:56.219 --> 44:59.224
And those millions of people,
what do they hear?

44:59.224 --> 45:01.078
My voice.

45:01.078 --> 45:02.677
And what do they see?

45:02.677 --> 45:03.732
My face.

45:04.691 --> 45:06.321
So you don't need my advice.

45:08.879 --> 45:10.125
Hammerschmidt's going to freak.

45:10.125 --> 45:11.660
You don't want to work anywhere

45:11.660 --> 45:13.706
you're not willing to get
fired from, Zoe.

45:13.706 --> 45:17.222
Treading water's the same as
drowning for people like you and me.

45:17.222 --> 45:18.533
Good luck.
I'll be watching.

45:18.533 --> 45:20.164
- Hey, wait.
- Yes?

45:20.164 --> 45:21.282
When do you get back?

45:21.282 --> 45:24.543
When I get back, you'll know.

45:28.060 --> 45:30.042
Hello, Nancy.

45:30.042 --> 45:32.344
Welcome back, sir.
Linda Vasquez called for you.

45:32.344 --> 45:33.846
Tell her I'll call her in a
couple hours with an update.

45:33.846 --> 45:35.381
- Very well.
- Sir?

45:35.381 --> 45:38.577
Unless you need anything,
Kyle has you covered.

45:38.577 --> 45:40.240
No, go home.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.614
You did well this weekend.

45:41.614 --> 45:43.053
Thank you, sir.

45:43.053 --> 45:45.770
Oh, and before you go home,
can you do me a favor?

45:45.770 --> 45:46.985
Would you swing by my house

45:46.985 --> 45:48.679
and make sure these get
to Claire?

45:48.679 --> 45:50.182
Yes, sir.

45:50.182 --> 45:52.452
And thank you, sir,
for being so patient.

45:59.229 --> 46:00.540
Okay.
