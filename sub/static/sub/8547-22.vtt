Is somebody there?

00:41.107 --> 00:43.074
It's me.

00:50.577 --> 00:52.006
Are you ok?

00:52.008 --> 00:53.376
Is your mom here?

00:53.378 --> 00:54.946
Mom?

00:54.948 --> 00:56.685
Yeah, baby.

00:56.687 --> 00:58.789
Oh, my God.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.558
Danny, what happened?

01:10.237 --> 01:12.275
JJ!

01:12.277 --> 01:13.938
Hey, hold on for a second.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.419
Garcia's calling.

01:20.265 --> 01:21.863
Hey, baby girl, what's good?

01:21.865 --> 01:24.332
Hooray! Happy breathing?
I wasn't invited. What's the occasion?

01:24.334 --> 01:25.603
I was just having a run
with JJ.

01:25.604 --> 01:26.578
Ohh, that's boring.

01:26.602 --> 01:28.237
See, couldn't you just
make something up,

01:28.238 --> 01:32.041
satiate my fabulous,
filthy imagination?

01:32.043 --> 01:34.910
Cut it out. What's going on?
You got something for us?

01:34.912 --> 01:37.248
Uh, yeah. Hate to ruin
your Saturday afternoon,

01:37.250 --> 01:38.913
but pack your champagne
wishes and caviar dreams.

01:38.915 --> 01:40.356
You got a case
out in Tinseltown.

01:40.358 --> 01:41.516
Oh, come on, Garcia,

01:41.518 --> 01:42.820
we're at least 4 miles
from the car right now.

01:42.822 --> 01:44.924
Well, the flight is super long
and Hotch wants everyone

01:44.926 --> 01:46.430
to meet on the plane,
so get your hustle on.

01:46.432 --> 01:48.434
All right. Give us
the highlights.

01:48.436 --> 01:49.940
Oh, yes,
I can do that happily.

01:49.942 --> 01:51.772
Although it's not
a happy thing

01:51.774 --> 01:54.044
since there are 3 murder
victims in the last 3 days.

01:54.046 --> 01:56.842
Ok, so, Nate Cochran, 46,
was found this morning.

01:56.844 --> 01:58.476
He's an accountant,
lives in Van Nuys,

01:58.478 --> 02:00.183
married, two children.

02:00.185 --> 02:01.953
With him was Tasha Brooks,

02:01.955 --> 02:04.091
22 years old, prostitute,
crack addict.

02:04.093 --> 02:05.723
No known address or family.

02:05.725 --> 02:08.232
They were found
in Nate's BMW.

02:08.234 --> 02:09.568
They were shot
multiple times

02:09.571 --> 02:11.768
about the chest, head,
and neck,

02:11.770 --> 02:12.808
but mostly in the face.

02:12.810 --> 02:14.545
What about
the third victim?

02:14.547 --> 02:17.075
Oh, he was actually
the very first victim.

02:17.077 --> 02:18.716
His name is Gary Fisher.
He was shot

02:18.718 --> 02:21.515
in his Jaguar 13 times,
also in the face.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.083
He was 42.
He was a banker.

02:23.085 --> 02:25.154
Uh, he lived in Studio City.
Divorced.

02:25.156 --> 02:28.226
Ballistics are an exact match
to the victims found this morning.

02:28.228 --> 02:29.723
Beemer and a Jag.
They left the car.

02:29.725 --> 02:32.428
Hey, Garcia, did
they take any money or valuables?

02:32.430 --> 02:33.397
Negative. Nothing.

02:33.399 --> 02:34.565
And this Fisher guy
was found alone?

02:34.567 --> 02:36.100
Yes, but he was found
in an area

02:36.102 --> 02:38.335
known for blow pops
and backdoor quickies.

02:38.337 --> 02:39.575
All right,
we're on our way.

02:39.577 --> 02:40.808
Happy trails, my heroes.

02:40.810 --> 02:41.976
Race you.

02:52.492 --> 02:54.658
Ow.

02:54.660 --> 02:57.089
Ow. Ow. Ow.

02:59.099 --> 03:02.297
Danny? You in there?

03:05.266 --> 03:07.537
I can hear you crying.

03:07.539 --> 03:10.739
I can hear you all
the way from my room.

03:14.116 --> 03:17.178
You got another headache?

03:19.116 --> 03:22.753
You, uh, want me
to do the thing again?

03:31.158 --> 03:32.451
How bad is it?

03:32.453 --> 03:34.387
It's bad.

03:34.389 --> 03:36.627
Worse than last time?

03:52.312 --> 03:53.781
Thank you.

03:56.784 --> 04:00.283
Patricia's mad at me.

04:00.285 --> 04:02.753
We're not just your
tenants, you know.

04:02.755 --> 04:06.748
She's your friend and she doesn't want
you to get hurt.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.084
Neither do I.

04:12.193 --> 04:14.063
I'm sorry.

04:16.731 --> 04:20.000
I don't know why
this is so hard.

04:21.538 --> 04:25.333
The right thing to do
is always the hardest thing to do,

04:25.335 --> 04:28.373
and you're doing
the right thing.

04:29.942 --> 04:32.978
I just miss my mom so much.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.706
That's why you
have to keep going

04:34.708 --> 04:37.175
and find that son of a bitch
who took her away from you.

04:37.177 --> 04:40.678
The whole world
needs help, Danny.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.415
Somebody has to be there,

04:43.417 --> 04:45.953
just like you're here
for us.

04:45.955 --> 04:47.522
Ow. Ow!

04:47.524 --> 04:48.994
Shh...It's ok.

04:48.996 --> 04:51.026
It's ok. It's ok.
It hurts so bad.

04:51.028 --> 04:52.896
Aah!

05:33.753 --> 05:34.959
Buddha.

05:34.961 --> 05:36.625
So two Johns and a hooker

05:36.627 --> 05:38.591
and no apparent connection
between any of them.

05:38.593 --> 05:41.264
And he doesn't rob them

05:41.266 --> 05:43.064
No forensic
countermeasures either.

05:43.066 --> 05:44.769
He probably
wants them found.

05:44.771 --> 05:46.170
It might be a message.

05:46.172 --> 05:47.435
I wonder what
he's trying to say.

05:47.437 --> 05:48.571
Maybe that he's angry.

05:48.573 --> 05:50.172
He's using
a .45-caliber weapon,

05:50.174 --> 05:52.784
and with each victim
he fired 13 shots.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.618
It's most likely every round
in the magazine

05:54.620 --> 05:57.889
and the one in the chamber.
It's basically overkill with a handgun.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.025
What's he angry about?

05:59.027 --> 06:00.457
Tasha Brooks
is African-American

06:00.459 --> 06:01.961
and the two Johns,
Gary Fisher

06:01.963 --> 06:03.496
and Nate Cochran,
they were both white.

06:03.498 --> 06:05.128
Guys, what if she's
the connection?

06:05.130 --> 06:06.730
What if these victims
were both her clients?

06:06.732 --> 06:08.530
Given the close proximity
of the murder sites,

06:08.532 --> 06:10.169
that is a distinct
possibility.

06:10.171 --> 06:12.001
So the first victim,
Gary Fisher, was found alone

06:12.003 --> 06:14.408
because maybe Tasha was there
and then got away?

06:14.410 --> 06:16.573
Or it was some other girl
and she got away.

06:16.575 --> 06:17.869
Presuming it is a woman.

06:17.871 --> 06:19.540
Either way, that means
there's someone out there

06:19.542 --> 06:21.044
that may have seen
the unsub.

06:21.046 --> 06:23.307
Then our first priority
should be finding that person.

06:28.884 --> 06:31.017
I can't thank all of you
enough for coming.

06:31.019 --> 06:32.447
Well, I hope we can help.

06:32.449 --> 06:35.319
We put all our street patrols
on double shifts like you asked.

06:35.321 --> 06:38.488
We rounded up every
working girl, pimp, crackhead in the area.

06:38.490 --> 06:39.992
Hopefully somebody
knows something.

06:39.994 --> 06:42.457
We better get to it.
We're gonna need to talk to 'em all.

06:42.459 --> 06:43.593
Well, ii won't be easy.

06:43.617 --> 06:45.197
I saw this all the time
when I worked sex crimes.

06:45.198 --> 06:47.299
Most of these women
have been victimized for years.

06:47.301 --> 06:49.530
Why don't we start with him.

06:49.532 --> 06:51.369
Eddie Parrish,
Tasha Brooks' pimp.

06:51.371 --> 06:52.968
Calls himself Sweetness.

06:52.970 --> 06:55.105
Aw, come on, now.
That was Walter Payton's nickname.

06:55.107 --> 06:56.671
That's just wrong.

06:56.673 --> 06:58.638
Like I told the cop
that dragged me up here,

06:58.640 --> 07:00.510
I work in a car wash.

07:00.512 --> 07:03.141
You've been picked up
for pandering before, Eddie.

07:03.143 --> 07:06.479
Two years probation and 100 hours
of community service.

07:06.481 --> 07:09.089
Car wash.

07:12.894 --> 07:14.228
Those are bank statements

07:14.230 --> 07:16.625
from one Mabel Parrish.

07:16.627 --> 07:20.496
That ring a bell?
Reno, Nevada.

07:20.498 --> 07:23.598
Yo, what y'all doin' with
my mama's banks statements, man?

07:23.600 --> 07:26.365
Looks like a few months ago,
right after you got off probation,

07:26.367 --> 07:28.069
she starting making
some cash deposits.

07:28.071 --> 07:28.941
And the weird thing is,

07:28.965 --> 07:31.312
it's way more than she
makes at that hair salon.

07:31.603 --> 07:33.472
Now, I assume the I.R.S.
is aware of it,

07:33.474 --> 07:35.570
but you never know
what they're gonna find

07:35.572 --> 07:37.338
if they dig
a little deeper.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.408
Y'all better leave
my mama alone, all right?

07:39.410 --> 07:41.607
Come on, now, Sweetness,

07:41.609 --> 07:43.047
you know the deal.

07:43.049 --> 07:45.142
Gotta play ball.

07:47.382 --> 07:48.380
'Aight.

07:48.382 --> 07:50.884
What y'all want to know
about Tasha?

07:50.886 --> 07:53.150
I ain't seen here
since Tuesday.

07:53.152 --> 07:54.454
And she hasn't been
returning your texts

07:54.456 --> 07:55.623
or your voicemails,
has she?

07:55.625 --> 07:57.191
Damn, is there anything
y'all don't know?

07:57.193 --> 07:58.895
What y'all need me for?

07:58.897 --> 08:00.631
We need you to tell us
who killed her.

08:00.633 --> 08:02.199
Who killed her?

08:02.201 --> 08:03.831
She dead?

08:08.475 --> 08:09.637
Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

08:09.661 --> 08:11.586
You--you don't think
it was me, do you?

08:11.706 --> 08:13.112
Should we?

08:13.114 --> 08:14.281
I didn't kill nobody, man.

08:14.283 --> 08:15.713
No, no, no, no, no, no,

08:15.715 --> 08:17.344
I swear to God.
I got alibis.

08:18.586 --> 08:20.877
Come on, man, what
you show me this for?

08:20.879 --> 08:22.547
We found her with him.

08:25.778 --> 08:28.877
I know that dude.

08:28.879 --> 08:30.547
He's a regular.

08:30.549 --> 08:31.547
What about that guy?

08:31.549 --> 08:33.881
Nah. I ain't never seen him.

08:33.884 --> 08:35.355
You sure about that?

08:35.357 --> 08:36.884
Yeah, I'm sure about that.
I ain't never seen him.

08:36.885 --> 08:38.892
I don't forget no faces.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.390
Whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:41.392 --> 08:43.429
This is over there
by the river.

08:43.431 --> 08:45.564
Tasha never got down there.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.500
Too far. Bad cell signal.

08:47.502 --> 08:51.204
Y'all need to talk to the girls
that work east of Alameda.

08:51.206 --> 08:54.406
Now, can you get these
pictures out of my face, man.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.280
You usually work east of
Alameda, over by the river?

09:04.317 --> 09:06.282
You ever seen this man?

09:06.284 --> 09:07.616
Mm-mmm.

09:07.618 --> 09:10.320
Are you sure?
Do you want to maybe take another look?

09:10.322 --> 09:13.622
I'm sure, baby.
I remember all the cute ones.

09:13.624 --> 09:15.750
Like you.

09:15.752 --> 09:18.325
I won't forget you
or your friend either.

09:25.770 --> 09:27.535
Lizette Castro?
I'm Agent Jareau,

09:27.537 --> 09:29.704
this is Agent Callahan.

09:29.706 --> 09:31.105
Am I under arrest?

09:31.107 --> 09:32.777
Did you do
something wrong?

09:32.779 --> 09:34.407
No.

09:34.409 --> 09:37.510
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

09:37.512 --> 09:39.709
That your first one?

09:39.711 --> 09:41.045
Oh, um,
technically, yes.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.875
I have a 13-year-old
at home.

09:42.877 --> 09:44.146
It's a long story.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.680
Then you should try
those seasickness bracelets.

09:46.682 --> 09:49.047
They got magnets in 'em.

09:49.049 --> 09:50.413
Worked for me.

09:50.415 --> 09:51.645
Thanks.

09:51.647 --> 09:55.053
So, Lizette, um, do you ever work
east of Alameda,

09:55.055 --> 09:57.221
over by the river?

09:59.359 --> 10:00.621
It's ok.

10:02.063 --> 10:03.956
Uh, yeah, sometimes.

10:03.958 --> 10:07.363
Have you ever seen
this man before?

10:08.229 --> 10:09.628
No.

10:09.630 --> 10:11.407
No.

10:11.409 --> 10:12.839
Never.

10:12.841 --> 10:14.376
You sure?

10:15.412 --> 10:16.412
I'm positive.

10:16.413 --> 10:18.653
Were you working
last Saturday?

10:18.655 --> 10:21.351
No, I was home.

10:25.227 --> 10:26.297
Is that it?

10:26.299 --> 10:27.299
Are we done?

10:27.300 --> 10:28.563
You in a hurry?

10:28.565 --> 10:30.604
Yeah, I gotta go pick up
my son from my sister's house.

10:30.606 --> 10:33.910
If you don't mind taking
one more look at the picture.

10:36.978 --> 10:40.849
I already told you,
I've never seen him before.

10:40.851 --> 10:42.786
Can I go now?

10:42.788 --> 10:44.353
I'm not under arrest, right?

10:44.355 --> 10:46.353
No.

10:46.355 --> 10:47.689
Ok.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.070
You should eat something.

11:04.072 --> 11:06.340
I'm not hungry.

11:08.371 --> 11:09.767
And maybe drink less.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.541
It helps his headaches.

11:12.543 --> 11:15.037
Is that true?
Yeah, sometimes.

11:15.039 --> 11:19.949
Mom, you shouldn't
make him feel so bad.

11:19.951 --> 11:22.719
Look at him. He's drunk.
He can't go out there.

11:22.721 --> 11:23.721
He's fine.

11:23.723 --> 11:25.491
I can hear you guys.

11:25.493 --> 11:28.261
We're just worried
about you.

11:28.263 --> 11:30.198
I'm ok.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.769
I'm not. You really
scared me last night.

11:32.771 --> 11:34.073
All that blood.

11:34.075 --> 11:36.536
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

11:36.538 --> 11:39.008
I'm sorry, but you know
I have to find that son of a bitch,

11:39.010 --> 11:41.109
especially before
he finds you.

11:41.111 --> 11:43.276
And when I saw those
disgusting whores,

11:43.278 --> 11:46.148
I couldn't just...

11:50.117 --> 11:51.682
I had to do something.

11:51.684 --> 11:54.252
This is
our neighborhood.

11:54.254 --> 11:55.957
We live here.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.464
Just be careful, ok?

11:59.834 --> 12:01.831
Promise me?

12:03.033 --> 12:05.397
I promise.

12:28.654 --> 12:31.021
Hey. Do you want a ride?

12:31.023 --> 12:32.262
No. Thank you.

12:32.264 --> 12:34.694
I can get you there
a lot faster than the bus.

12:36.464 --> 12:41.269
Come on, it's late, all right?
I just want to help you.

12:54.217 --> 12:55.455
Thanks.

12:55.457 --> 12:57.152
Not a problem.

12:57.154 --> 12:58.961
Where to?

12:58.963 --> 13:01.298
Oh, you can just take
a left up here.

13:01.300 --> 13:04.701
So, um, how old's
your little boy?

13:05.569 --> 13:06.569
6.

13:06.570 --> 13:08.040
Oh, mine, too.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.544
What's his name?

13:11.579 --> 13:14.585
Santiago.

13:14.587 --> 13:16.386
We call him Santi.

13:16.388 --> 13:18.387
Until I had a kid,
I didn't know

13:18.389 --> 13:19.819
I could miss someone
so bad.

13:19.821 --> 13:22.185
It's hard when you
gotta work all the time.

13:28.069 --> 13:29.867
You know, what, Lizette?

13:29.869 --> 13:32.899
Doing this job, sometimes you get
feelings about people,

13:32.901 --> 13:34.371
and the one thing
I've learned

13:34.373 --> 13:37.404
is that when you get that feeling,
you better listen.

13:37.406 --> 13:41.013
You know what
I'm feeling about you?

13:41.015 --> 13:42.847
You're stressed out.

13:42.849 --> 13:45.216
You were caught
in a bad situation

13:45.218 --> 13:47.057
and you are scared.

13:47.059 --> 13:48.257
Mostly for Santi.

13:48.259 --> 13:50.855
So when I showed you
that picture, you lied,

13:50.857 --> 13:53.391
because you thought
that was the best way to protect him,

13:53.393 --> 13:54.959
but it's not.

13:54.961 --> 13:56.600
Telling the truth

13:56.602 --> 13:59.833
is the only way
to keep him safe.

13:59.835 --> 14:03.209
I can help you, ok?
I can.

14:03.211 --> 14:06.577
But you
have to trust me.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.409
Ok, I lied.

14:08.411 --> 14:10.540
I didn't do it, ok?

14:10.542 --> 14:13.211
You have to believe me.
He was being crazy.

14:13.213 --> 14:14.243
I thought
he was gonna kill me.

14:14.245 --> 14:16.881
Ok. Ok. Calm down.
Calm down.

14:16.883 --> 14:18.448
Just tell me
what happened.

14:18.450 --> 14:21.584
Ok, uh, the man
that you showed me

14:21.586 --> 14:25.583
picked me up last Saturday.

14:25.585 --> 14:29.918
Uh, we went over by the river

14:29.920 --> 14:33.494
and we got in the backseat.

14:37.432 --> 14:39.197
Suddenly the window was smashed.

14:39.199 --> 14:42.867
He started pulling him
from the car

14:42.869 --> 14:45.898
and he was kicking his ass
and yelling at him.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.267
What was he saying?

14:47.269 --> 14:49.173
You stay out of my city!

14:49.175 --> 14:51.907
I don't know, he kept telling him
to stay out of his city.

14:51.909 --> 14:54.243
Did you get
a good look at him?

14:54.245 --> 14:57.315
He was wearing a hoodie,
but I'm pretty sure he was white.

14:57.317 --> 14:58.945
Stay down!

14:58.947 --> 15:01.942
He just started shooting,
and I ran.

15:05.895 --> 15:07.736
Please, I did not have
anything to do with it.

15:07.753 --> 15:08.694
You have to believe me.

15:08.695 --> 15:10.894
Please don't take my son
away from me. Please--

15:10.896 --> 15:13.632
No, no. No one is gonna
take your son.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.070
Ok?

15:22.006 --> 15:23.803
Just be careful, ok?

15:23.805 --> 15:25.569
Promise me?

15:26.907 --> 15:29.007
Help!

15:30.377 --> 15:32.543
Help! Help!

15:32.545 --> 15:33.986
Hey!

15:33.988 --> 15:35.283
Hey! Stop!

15:41.065 --> 15:44.265
Aah!  Ohh!

15:44.267 --> 15:46.305
Are--are you--
are you ok?

15:46.307 --> 15:48.074
Are you shot?
Did I shoot you?

15:49.811 --> 15:51.872
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

15:51.874 --> 15:55.740
Please don't die.
Pl-please don't die.

16:05.056 --> 16:07.349
This is all your fault.

16:09.325 --> 16:11.755
You're just like him.

16:23.391 --> 16:26.088
Kid's name is Lamar Taylor.
Weed dealer, car thief.

16:26.090 --> 16:27.728
We've picked him up
a bunch of times.

16:27.730 --> 16:30.790
.45-caliber shells.
Gotta be our guy, right?

16:30.792 --> 16:32.767
Yeah, but this crime
scene's total chaos.

16:32.769 --> 16:34.295
Look at this guy.
More than just shot,

16:34.297 --> 16:36.999
he's been beaten to a pulp.
The others weren't this bad.

16:37.001 --> 16:38.238
Well, he's escalating.

16:38.262 --> 16:39.768
He's either getting more
angry or losing control.

16:39.769 --> 16:42.808
Or both. He might also
be on drugs.

16:42.810 --> 16:44.544
This has gotta be
her purse.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.774
I wonder if he was
trying to snatch it.

16:46.776 --> 16:48.542
This neighborhood?
That's a good bet.

16:48.544 --> 16:51.677
Well, her name is
Clara Miller, 68-year-old

16:51.679 --> 16:53.453
retired schoolteacher.

16:53.455 --> 16:55.685
Guys, I don't think
she's shot anywhere.

16:55.687 --> 16:56.821
I don't see blood, nothing.

16:56.823 --> 16:58.053
Maybe he hit her
in the head.

16:58.055 --> 17:02.019
I don't see anything
like that right here.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.027
Heart disease.

17:03.029 --> 17:04.227
I don't get it.

17:04.229 --> 17:07.457
First hookers and Johns
and now these two.

17:07.459 --> 17:10.127
Kid tries to steal
an old lady's purse,

17:10.130 --> 17:12.895
unsub runs up on her,
kills the kid.

17:12.896 --> 17:15.493
Old lady has a heart attack.
I think I know what this is.

17:15.496 --> 17:16.935
I'm right with you.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.967
We should deliver
the profile.

17:20.273 --> 17:24.009
We're looking for who we believe
is a white male in his 20s.

17:24.011 --> 17:25.944
He's what we call
a moral enforcer,

17:25.945 --> 17:28.278
which is a vigilante
of sorts.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.741
An autopsy
on one of the victims

17:29.743 --> 17:31.748
showed evidence
of postmortem violence.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.748
This speaks to the unsub's
level of anger.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.117
He began by victimizing
prostitutes and their clients,

17:36.119 --> 17:38.485
and he's moved on to what we
believe is a mugging situation.

17:38.487 --> 17:41.250
He's mission oriented.
In his mind, he may believe

17:41.252 --> 17:43.323
it's his duty
to clean up the streets.

17:43.325 --> 17:44.858
He probably does
nightly patrols

17:44.860 --> 17:47.458
and stalks anyone that
he thinks is suspicious.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.166
Not only is it possible

17:49.190 --> 17:51.100
he may suffer from some kind
of drug-related psychosis,

17:51.101 --> 17:54.237
but we think he also may have been
a victim of violent crime himself.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.873
And this appears to be personal,
which makes him more dangerous.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.011
He's gaining confidence
with every kill.

17:59.013 --> 18:00.716
And as his confidence grows,

18:00.718 --> 18:02.516
so will his belief
in his cause.

18:02.518 --> 18:04.724
He lives in the area
and he probably grew up here,

18:04.726 --> 18:06.691
but we think he's
severely antisocial.

18:06.693 --> 18:09.625
He probably couldn't hold down
more than a part-time job.

18:09.627 --> 18:12.391
Unfortunately, the statistics
do not support this ending well.

18:12.393 --> 18:15.062
In the vast majority of
these type of serial crimes,

18:15.064 --> 18:17.598
the murderer usually
doesn't go down easily

18:17.600 --> 18:19.198
and isn't apprehended alive.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.134
But so far he's been smart enough
to run away before the cops show up.

18:22.136 --> 18:23.966
Even though he's a vigilante,
he may not think

18:23.968 --> 18:26.839
we're all on the same team catching
the bad guy together.

18:26.841 --> 18:28.072
In fact, his zeal
may be connected

18:28.074 --> 18:30.040
to a deep mistrust
of law enforcement.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.208
So we need you to tell
the working girls, your informants,

18:32.210 --> 18:33.847
anyone else out on the street,
to keep a lookout.

18:33.849 --> 18:36.748
And, please, proceed
with extreme caution.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.245
This guys is strapped
with a .45-caliber

18:38.247 --> 18:39.716
and he's not afraid
to use it.

18:39.718 --> 18:43.251
So if you think you have
a line on him, do not try to be a hero.

18:43.253 --> 18:44.219
Call for backup.

18:44.221 --> 18:45.953
All right, guys,
let's get to it.

18:49.291 --> 18:52.324
You were so cute.

18:52.326 --> 18:55.230
She was a great lady,
your mom.

18:55.232 --> 18:56.872
I remember when
we first moved in.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.904
I never knew a landlord
could be so nice.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.744
It's not fair.

19:02.746 --> 19:04.408
She should still be here.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.744
She didn't deserve that.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.079
Life's not fair, Danny.

19:08.081 --> 19:10.045
I know that!

19:13.883 --> 19:15.448
I know.

19:17.816 --> 19:19.045
I get that you're hurting,

19:19.047 --> 19:21.212
but you don't need
to take it out on us.

19:21.214 --> 19:22.451
We miss her, too, you know.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.684
Well, it's your fault
he was even around.

19:24.686 --> 19:27.125
Don't you dare
blame me for this.

19:27.127 --> 19:29.663
He was your ex.
He was here looking for you.

19:31.096 --> 19:34.090
You should be
the one that's dead.

19:39.599 --> 19:41.566
That went well.

19:41.568 --> 19:45.332
You know what might
make you feel better?

19:45.334 --> 19:48.331
Cleaning this place up.

19:48.333 --> 19:49.601
It stinks.

19:49.603 --> 19:52.632
I'm actually wrong,
you know?

19:55.105 --> 19:56.438
It should have been me.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.406
Don't say that.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.845
Everything happens
for a reason.

20:01.847 --> 20:05.278
If it was you that got shot that night,
who would protect us, huh?

20:05.280 --> 20:07.247
That animal is still out there

20:07.249 --> 20:10.383
and the cops
don't even care.

20:10.385 --> 20:13.621
You're the only one
that's gonna find him, Danny.

20:13.623 --> 20:17.891
You're doing the right thing.

20:17.893 --> 20:21.692
Your mom
would be proud of you.

20:24.164 --> 20:25.561
Go ahead, Garcia.

20:25.563 --> 20:26.674
Sir, per your request,

20:26.698 --> 20:28.434
I did some delving
into the latest victims,

20:28.435 --> 20:30.496
and, uh, get ready
for a big paradigm shift

20:30.498 --> 20:32.831
regarding the personality
of Lamar Taylor.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.438
He was a bad kid,
operative word, was.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.144
Present tense now,
he was in his first semester

20:38.146 --> 20:39.641
at a local community college,

20:39.643 --> 20:41.112
and Clara Miller, the woman,

20:41.114 --> 20:43.144
she was his high school
teacher.

20:43.146 --> 20:45.617
He was a super at-risk kid,
he had trouble at home,

20:45.619 --> 20:47.649
and Clara helped him.
She helped him through school.

20:47.651 --> 20:48.817
She helped him graduate.

20:48.819 --> 20:50.954
So there's no way
that was a mugging.

20:50.956 --> 20:54.521
No. No. Unless it's some sort
of, you know, bizarro universe,

20:54.523 --> 20:55.962
with a square planet,
where things

20:55.964 --> 20:57.362
are like exactly the opposite,
totally the same.

20:57.364 --> 20:59.666
Black kid, white lady.
He probably racially profiled

20:59.668 --> 21:02.130
the situation and just
jumped to conclusions.

21:02.132 --> 21:04.467
We need to alert the press
and warn the public.

21:04.469 --> 21:06.308
Thanks, Garcia.

21:15.282 --> 21:16.879
Thanks for coming.

21:20.584 --> 21:22.319
Ta-daa.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.627
What do you think?
I cleaned it up.

21:28.629 --> 21:29.626
We.

21:29.628 --> 21:32.896
We. Right. We.
We cleaned it up.

21:34.599 --> 21:36.062
It looks great.

21:39.105 --> 21:41.704
These are for you.

21:42.778 --> 21:46.009
I'm sorry for what I said.
I didn't mean it.

21:53.084 --> 21:55.581
The roses make your eyes
look beautiful.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.251
I mean, they're already
beautiful eyes.

21:57.253 --> 22:00.417
I just mean, with
the flowers, they're...

22:00.419 --> 22:02.051
more beautiful.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.188
Thank you.

22:06.095 --> 22:08.262
You're forgiven.

22:08.264 --> 22:10.861
I know it's been tough.

22:19.410 --> 22:22.279
I'm gonna go put these
in water before I go to work.

22:22.281 --> 22:23.544
Patricia,

22:23.546 --> 22:25.353
please don't go to work.

22:25.355 --> 22:27.217
It's too dangerous.
He's still out there.

22:27.219 --> 22:29.587
I can't keep calling in sick.
They're gonna fire me.

22:29.589 --> 22:32.763
So what? It's better
than ending up like my mom.

22:32.765 --> 22:34.363
But, Danny, I have to work.

22:34.365 --> 22:37.130
What if you didn't
have to pay rent?

22:37.132 --> 22:39.034
What are you talking about?

22:39.036 --> 22:40.898
The house is paid for, right?
And I don't want your money.

22:40.900 --> 22:43.506
And with what I make
at the restaurant, I could feed us all.

22:43.508 --> 22:45.138
You would do that for us?

22:45.140 --> 22:48.241
I would do anything for you.

22:53.679 --> 22:55.108
Ok.

22:55.110 --> 22:58.345
But only until
you find him.

22:58.347 --> 22:59.472
We're not freeloaders.

22:59.474 --> 23:00.775
I know.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.949
Thank you.

23:16.456 --> 23:17.821
Nice job.

23:17.823 --> 23:20.123
Thanks for the advice.

23:20.125 --> 23:22.727
Just stick with me, kid.

23:22.729 --> 23:24.892
Good afternoon.
I'm SSA Jennifer Jareau.

23:24.894 --> 23:27.386
Due to a recent string
of shooting deaths,

23:27.388 --> 23:30.325
we now have reason
to believe a vigilante is on the loose.

23:30.327 --> 23:32.755
We are warning everyone
to be on the lookout

23:32.757 --> 23:35.553
and to report
any suspicious behavior.

23:35.555 --> 23:38.655
We believe this man
is a Caucasian in his 20s.

23:38.657 --> 23:40.454
He is armed
and very dangerous.

23:42.559 --> 23:47.228
Wow. Are they, uh,
talking about you?

23:47.230 --> 23:49.132
That had to be
about you, right?

23:49.134 --> 23:51.468
They don't understand.
I'm trying to help.

23:51.470 --> 23:52.602
If they would just
do their jobs,

23:52.604 --> 23:54.939
I wouldn't need
to do it for them.

23:57.375 --> 24:00.013
Be extra careful tonight.

24:00.015 --> 24:03.645
And do not tell my mom
about this.

24:13.020 --> 24:15.656
You got a problem, bro?

24:18.889 --> 24:20.653
What are you lookin' at?

24:24.326 --> 24:26.493
Be extra careful.

24:30.003 --> 24:31.969
Yeah, that's what I thought.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.073
Walk away, bitch.

24:35.011 --> 24:37.345
Stop! Ohh!

24:37.347 --> 24:39.049
No! don't!

24:39.051 --> 24:41.585
No! Stop! Stop!

24:42.753 --> 24:45.846
Stop! Stop! Stop!

24:46.752 --> 24:50.055
You want to rape girls,
you son of a bitch?

24:50.057 --> 24:52.988
Get him! Get him!
Make it fast!

25:01.430 --> 25:05.165
Yeah. Kill him. Kill him!

25:06.535 --> 25:08.638
Right now!

25:16.100 --> 25:17.762
Her name's Lindsey Cooper.

25:17.764 --> 25:19.002
Some bouncer called 911

25:19.004 --> 25:21.096
after she ran into
a night club screaming for help.

25:21.098 --> 25:22.199
What about the victim?

25:22.201 --> 25:24.070
His name was
Christopher Deluca.

25:24.072 --> 25:26.638
Shot multiple times,
beaten pretty badly, too.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.136
Apparently
he was her boyfriend.

25:28.138 --> 25:30.544
They found shell casings
from a .45 on the scene.

25:30.546 --> 25:33.406
She told cops that the shooter
was a white guy wearing a hoodie.

25:33.408 --> 25:35.343
Spreewell and his guys are
canvassing the area.

25:35.345 --> 25:37.815
He left a witness this time.
He's getting sloppy.

25:37.817 --> 25:40.750
Is she in any condition to talk?
She looks pretty freaked out.

25:40.752 --> 25:42.581
She keeps clenching
her jaw, drinking water,

25:42.583 --> 25:45.022
and can't seem to sit still.
I think she's on something,

25:45.024 --> 25:47.423
and I'm assuming it's MDMA.

25:47.425 --> 25:50.157
All right, Kate, you and JJ see what
you can find out from her.

25:50.159 --> 25:53.291
And, Reid, you and Morgan
go to the crime scene.

25:55.332 --> 25:56.794
Thanks.

25:56.796 --> 26:00.830
Lindsey, I'm Jennifer.
I'm with the FBI.

26:00.832 --> 26:02.029
Hi, I'm Kate.

26:02.031 --> 26:03.929
Can I get you anything?

26:03.931 --> 26:05.424
More water, please.

26:12.301 --> 26:13.964
You all right?

26:16.407 --> 26:22.078
Look, we know that this all
has you pretty freaked out.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.383
And I'm sure it probably
doesn't help

26:24.385 --> 26:28.814
that your heart is still racing
from the Molly you popped earlier.

26:28.816 --> 26:32.316
But we need your help.

26:32.318 --> 26:34.316
What happened tonight?

26:36.421 --> 26:38.553
Chris and I went out.

26:38.555 --> 26:42.621
You're right,
he had some Molly.

26:44.924 --> 26:47.354
I don't know what...

26:47.356 --> 26:50.593
I started rolling really hard,
and we went outside

26:50.595 --> 26:53.223
and we smoked a cigarette,
and we were kissing.

26:58.999 --> 27:02.668
This guy came out of nowhere
and he started beating on Chris.

27:02.670 --> 27:04.932
He was screaming.
He thought I was being raped.

27:04.934 --> 27:06.868
You want to rape girls,
you son of a bitch?!

27:06.870 --> 27:09.035
Stop! He's not raping me!

27:09.037 --> 27:10.876
I told him he wasn't.

27:10.878 --> 27:12.172
Stop, please.

27:12.174 --> 27:15.108
Please don't.
Please, that's my boyfriend.

27:15.110 --> 27:16.684
I told him to stop
and he wouldn't.

27:16.686 --> 27:19.051
Please!

27:19.053 --> 27:21.821
He took out a gun
and he started shooting him.

27:21.823 --> 27:24.086
No!

27:24.088 --> 27:25.454
Aah!

27:25.456 --> 27:28.694
I didn't know what else
to do. I just...

27:28.696 --> 27:33.100
I left my boyfriend there
and I just ran.

27:35.701 --> 27:38.498
Lindsey, did you get
a good look at him?

27:38.500 --> 27:40.832
Yeah.

27:41.738 --> 27:44.404
Good enough to describe
to a sketch artist?

27:46.698 --> 27:48.198
Yeah.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.869
Composite sketch of the unsub.

27:50.871 --> 27:52.469
I already went wide
to the press.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.005
Best lead we've had
so far.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.005
Crime scene
was total chaos.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.973
Ballistics confirmed
another exact match.

27:57.975 --> 27:59.844
Guys, something
doesn't add up.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.707
We profiled this unsub would have
an intimate knowledge of his kill zone.

28:02.709 --> 28:05.178
Right? But so far he's chosen
impoverished neighborhoods

28:05.180 --> 28:06.314
with high crime rates.

28:06.316 --> 28:07.649
Last night, he chose
a neighborhood

28:07.651 --> 28:08.912
that's been recently
gentrified

28:08.914 --> 28:10.615
and has a relatively
low crime rate.

28:10.617 --> 28:11.751
Why the shift?

28:11.753 --> 28:13.148
He's getting
more and more bold.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.979
Or he's losing his grip
on reality.

28:14.981 --> 28:16.314
Maybe this isn't
drug related.

28:16.316 --> 28:17.817
What if this guy's
actually delusional,

28:17.819 --> 28:20.921
as in the paranoid
schizophrenic variety?

28:20.923 --> 28:22.521
So this could be
a psychotic break.

28:22.523 --> 28:23.854
That's possible.

28:23.856 --> 28:26.316
His vigilante mission
could have become his sole focus

28:26.318 --> 28:28.324
and now he's seeing trouble
wherever he looks for it.

28:28.326 --> 28:30.323
Then his delusions
are driving him.

28:30.325 --> 28:32.323
Explains the shift
in victimology.

28:32.325 --> 28:35.191
Now anyone could be
a target to him.

28:41.130 --> 28:42.897
Excuse me.

28:44.003 --> 28:46.074
No, no, no, no.
You stay away from me.

28:46.076 --> 28:47.370
You ok?

28:47.372 --> 28:48.970
What happened?

28:50.613 --> 28:53.913
I told you to stay away
from me! You didn't listen!

28:53.915 --> 28:55.809
Oh, my God,
what did you do?!

28:55.811 --> 28:57.584
He was gonna arrest me.

28:57.586 --> 29:00.245
Arrest you?
What are you talking about?

29:00.247 --> 29:02.575
The mailman?

29:02.577 --> 29:04.445
Are you seeing things
again, Danny?

29:04.447 --> 29:05.980
No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:05.982 --> 29:07.308
Are you taking your meds?

29:07.310 --> 29:08.548
No, I hate them.

29:08.550 --> 29:11.087
Ohh, Danny.
We have to go to the police.

29:11.089 --> 29:12.183
No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:12.185 --> 29:13.455
No, no, no, no.
They can help.

29:13.457 --> 29:15.256
No, no, I said no!
They'll understand.

29:15.258 --> 29:19.127
We can't trust them.
They're useless. You know that.

29:19.129 --> 29:22.126
Danny, if you don't
call them, I will.

29:25.168 --> 29:26.829
What?

29:28.335 --> 29:31.006
You need help.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.344
You're not
calling anybody.

29:37.346 --> 29:39.248
Danny.

29:39.250 --> 29:41.049
Okey-dokey, artichokey
in the pokey,

29:41.051 --> 29:44.416
victims of violent crime in Los Angeles
over the last 5 years.

29:44.418 --> 29:46.624
That is one honkin' list.

29:46.626 --> 29:48.889
We are talking
tens of thousands of names.

29:48.891 --> 29:51.793
All right, Garcia, cross-check that list
against medical records.

29:51.795 --> 29:53.235
Anyone with mental health issues

29:53.259 --> 29:55.100
that maybe have been
prescribed antipsychotics.

29:55.101 --> 29:58.939
Specifically resperidone,
olanzapine, haloperidol, clozapine--

29:58.941 --> 30:01.002
Ok, ok, I got it.
Brain drugs, right.

30:01.004 --> 30:04.781
Ok, ok, that's a still
unmanageable 2,948 names.

30:04.783 --> 30:07.184
All right, now check
within a 5-mile radius of the kill zone.

30:08.818 --> 30:10.489
Hey! That's more like it.
6 names.

30:10.491 --> 30:14.625
Scratch that. Two names because
two died and two moved out of state.

30:14.627 --> 30:15.793
What's that
leave us with?

30:15.795 --> 30:18.296
Herman Koldyke,
68-year-old Vietnam vet

30:18.298 --> 30:20.695
with severe PTSD.
He was stabbed during a robbery.

30:20.697 --> 30:22.694
And Sandra Cunningham,
40-year-old cashier,

30:22.696 --> 30:25.132
was bipolar, who was
the victim of a rape.

30:25.134 --> 30:26.803
Those two don't exactly
fit our profile.

30:26.805 --> 30:27.867
Do any of the 6 people

30:27.891 --> 30:30.092
on your list have relatives
that still live in the area?

30:30.304 --> 30:32.280
Yes. One of the
aforementioned deceased,

30:32.282 --> 30:36.050
Miriam Stokes, 50-year-old landlord,
with schizophrenia.

30:36.052 --> 30:38.756
A year ago she was shot
and killed in a burglary.

30:38.758 --> 30:42.463
Her son, Daniel Lee Stokes,
still lives in the building that she owned.

30:42.465 --> 30:43.897
What else you got
on this guy?

30:43.899 --> 30:47.200
Uh, he's 24, he works
as a part-time bus boy

30:47.202 --> 30:50.473
at a Mexican restaurant--
with really good Yelp reviews--

30:50.475 --> 30:54.577
and he was diagnosed with severe
paranoid schizophrenia 3 years ago.

30:54.579 --> 30:55.842
Just like his mother.

30:55.844 --> 30:56.914
Oh, snap.

30:56.916 --> 30:58.578
Last week,
Daniel was questioned

30:58.580 --> 31:00.380
regarding the disappearance
of Patricia Valdez

31:00.381 --> 31:02.885
and Milena Valdez,
her 16-year-old daughter.

31:02.887 --> 31:04.614
They lived in his building.

31:04.638 --> 31:06.711
They disappeared two weeks ago.
Stokes was cleared.

31:06.862 --> 31:09.524
Garcia, did they ever
catch the guy that shot his mom?

31:09.526 --> 31:11.227
No. No, never.

31:11.229 --> 31:13.427
But, hello, thickening plot.

31:13.429 --> 31:15.699
The prime suspect
of said shooting

31:15.701 --> 31:18.804
was Patricia Valdez' ex,
David Ruiz.

31:18.806 --> 31:22.373
He's currently in custody
of the San Diego sheriff's department

31:22.375 --> 31:24.046
awaiting trial
for armed robbery.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.278
You got a picture of Stokes?

31:25.280 --> 31:28.615
Yeah. He's two years behind
on his license renewal,

31:28.617 --> 31:30.352
but there you go.

31:30.354 --> 31:32.624
Garcia,
we need an address.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.702
You really think that guy
had something to do with

31:43.704 --> 31:45.406
that missing mother and daughter?
Let's hope not.

31:45.408 --> 31:46.574
You got other units
en route?

31:46.576 --> 31:47.742
Yeah,
two minutes out.

31:47.744 --> 31:49.174
You and your boys
take the back.

31:49.176 --> 31:50.815
We're going in the front.

32:20.199 --> 32:23.201
Why are you doing this
to us?

32:29.242 --> 32:31.975
That won't help.
It'll only make it worse.

32:31.977 --> 32:34.271
Shut up! I didn't ask you
what you thought!

32:36.080 --> 32:37.509
Did I, Patricia?

32:37.511 --> 32:39.645
Patricia.
He has them in there.

32:39.647 --> 32:41.612
No, that's right, I did not.

32:47.221 --> 32:49.682
It helps me
with my headaches.

32:51.524 --> 32:52.955
Aah!

32:52.957 --> 32:55.890
Unlike you right now.

32:55.892 --> 32:58.290
You leave mom out of this!

33:00.059 --> 33:01.496
When?! Huh?!

33:01.498 --> 33:03.063
Tell me! Tell me when!

33:03.065 --> 33:04.926
Tell me! Tell me!

33:04.928 --> 33:08.732
When your mom died,
you promised you would take your meds.

33:08.734 --> 33:10.467
You promised!

33:12.931 --> 33:16.202
You're really scaring me,
Danny.

33:18.173 --> 33:21.181
Daniel Lee Stokes,
this is the FBI.

33:21.183 --> 33:24.918
We just want to ask you
a few questions, Daniel. Is that ok?

33:26.521 --> 33:28.752
Daniel,
we know you're in there--

33:34.330 --> 33:36.897
Get back! I've got hostages!

33:47.657 --> 33:51.464
Don't do this.
They'll kill you.

33:51.466 --> 33:54.160
Please stop.
Just let us go.

33:54.162 --> 33:55.432
Let you go?

33:55.434 --> 33:56.696
To them?

33:56.698 --> 33:59.503
They can't keep you safe.
That's my job.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.471
Who's he yelling at?
I don't hear anyone else talking.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.734
I love you!
Can't you see that?

34:07.010 --> 34:09.379
I love you.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.349
Why can't you see that?

34:12.351 --> 34:14.790
All I ever tried to do
was protect you.

34:16.328 --> 34:18.628
All I ever tried to do
was protect you!

34:18.630 --> 34:19.755
Daniel?

34:19.757 --> 34:22.597
Is that Patricia
in there with you?

34:22.599 --> 34:24.366
You want to protect her?

34:24.368 --> 34:26.570
We can help you with that.

34:26.572 --> 34:27.938
Who's there?

34:27.940 --> 34:29.978
She's with me.
We're still out here, Daniel.

34:35.853 --> 34:38.821
Can you hear that?
There's more of us coming, man.

34:41.422 --> 34:43.829
Stay back!

34:45.096 --> 34:49.101
Ok, Daniel, if you have
Patricia in there,

34:49.103 --> 34:50.871
you want to protect her,

34:50.873 --> 34:54.106
this is not the best way
to do that.

34:54.108 --> 34:56.409
How about Milena,
Daniel, is she in there, too?

34:56.411 --> 34:58.513
Yes, yes!
Shh, shh! Quiet. Shh!

34:58.515 --> 35:00.016
Don't speak.

35:00.979 --> 35:03.785
Daniel, we know
about your mom.

35:05.651 --> 35:06.657
Shut up!

35:06.659 --> 35:08.257
You don't know anything
about her.

35:08.259 --> 35:10.625
We know that she was
shot in cold blood,

35:10.627 --> 35:12.058
and you're angry
about it.

35:12.060 --> 35:14.058
She--she didn't
deserve that.

35:14.060 --> 35:16.297
That animal
is still out there!

35:16.299 --> 35:17.695
No, Daniel, we found him.

35:17.697 --> 35:20.463
David Ruiz, right?

35:20.465 --> 35:21.968
You're lying.

35:21.970 --> 35:24.168
No, Daniel, we found him
in San Diego.

35:24.170 --> 35:26.376
I can take you right to him
if you want,

35:26.378 --> 35:28.272
but you have to come out first.

35:28.274 --> 35:29.776
We got units in the back
ready to go in.

35:29.778 --> 35:31.376
Have them stand by.

35:31.378 --> 35:34.784
All right, Daniel, if you have Patricia
and Milena in there,

35:34.786 --> 35:36.848
do the right thing
and give yourself up.

35:36.850 --> 35:38.615
Come on, man, listen to her.

35:38.617 --> 35:40.781
Daniel, there's cops
everywhere.

35:40.783 --> 35:43.484
You can't protect them
from that, but we can.

35:56.027 --> 35:57.666
Shh. Stay quiet.

35:57.668 --> 35:59.297
Stay quiet.

35:59.299 --> 36:01.232
Please, Danny.

36:01.234 --> 36:03.336
Give up.

36:03.338 --> 36:04.537
You know what?

36:04.539 --> 36:06.307
She's right, Danny boy.

36:09.679 --> 36:12.485
Huh? How did you get here?

36:12.487 --> 36:15.420
What to do. What to do.

36:15.422 --> 36:17.420
Get away.

36:17.422 --> 36:19.219
Yo! I need a cigarette.

36:19.221 --> 36:20.289
You got a cigarette?

36:20.291 --> 36:22.487
And it better not be
mentholated neither.

36:22.489 --> 36:23.623
Yeah, I got one.

36:23.625 --> 36:25.360
She doesn't need
a cigarette.

36:25.362 --> 36:27.161
No. No, no, no. Stop.

36:27.163 --> 36:29.328
You know, Danny, it really
should have been you.

36:29.330 --> 36:30.864
What?

36:32.668 --> 36:34.570
No, stop. Stop!

36:36.845 --> 36:38.244
No, don't give her
the light.

36:38.246 --> 36:41.511
She doesn't need
the cigarette.

36:41.513 --> 36:43.152
Ow!

36:43.154 --> 36:46.228
You're sick. You should have
never stopped taking the meds.

36:46.230 --> 36:48.091
It should've been you,

36:48.115 --> 36:50.115
it should've been you,
it should've been you.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.607
It should have been me.

36:58.609 --> 36:59.841
Danny, no!

36:59.843 --> 37:02.409
Please, don't, Danny!
We love you, too!

37:02.411 --> 37:04.680
No, Danny. don't do it.

37:04.682 --> 37:05.848
They're wrong, Danny.

37:05.850 --> 37:07.183
Don't say that, Danny.

37:07.185 --> 37:08.517
It's not your fault.

37:08.519 --> 37:10.451
We love you.

37:23.361 --> 37:25.257
Drop the weapon.

37:28.465 --> 37:31.097
Where's Patricia
and Milena?

37:32.036 --> 37:33.907
Protect them, please.

37:33.909 --> 37:35.403
I can't protect them

37:35.405 --> 37:37.940
if you don't tell me
where they are, Daniel.

37:43.951 --> 37:46.284

38:38.903 --> 38:41.470
His mother must have
helped him manage his illness,

38:41.472 --> 38:43.470
and after she was gone,
it was only a matter of time

38:43.472 --> 38:46.206
before he went off
his meds and unraveled completely.

38:46.208 --> 38:48.110
And I bet he blamed
them for her murder.

38:48.112 --> 38:50.877
A stressor like that, it's no surprise
he eventually snapped.

38:50.879 --> 38:52.445
He didn't care
about his other victims.

38:52.447 --> 38:54.117
Why did he take the time
to bury those two?

38:54.119 --> 38:56.750
It was probably before
his psychotic break became full-blown.

38:56.752 --> 39:00.157

39:38.403 --> 39:40.209
Oh, wait a minute.
Pizza party?

39:40.211 --> 39:42.505
I have two pizzas
and they've just been delivered,

39:42.507 --> 39:43.914
which means they're
extra delicious.

39:43.916 --> 39:44.873
I smell mushrooms.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.912
Pepperoni.
Those from Riggio's?

39:46.914 --> 39:48.575
Yes, they are. I thought you guys
would be hungry

39:48.577 --> 39:49.711
upon your arrival.

39:49.713 --> 39:51.750
Ooh, no, thanks.
The smell grosses me out.

39:51.752 --> 39:53.983
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

39:53.985 --> 39:56.147
No worries.
This pregnancy thing can be freaky.

39:56.149 --> 39:58.019
Ok, there's--there's
something you're not telling us.

39:58.021 --> 40:00.189
Yeah. I thought this
would help you guys

40:00.191 --> 40:01.659
with all the extra work
you have to do right now.

40:01.661 --> 40:03.226
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean,
extra work?

40:03.228 --> 40:04.288
What's going on?

40:04.290 --> 40:06.389
Cruz called. He wants
all the case assessments

40:06.391 --> 40:07.884
for the congressional
oversight meeting.

40:07.886 --> 40:09.019
I knew it.

40:09.021 --> 40:10.419
That meeting's not
for another 3 weeks.

40:10.421 --> 40:12.753
Yeah, it was, until they moved it
to Monday.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.660
But I have pizza.
Not for you.

40:19.391 --> 40:22.325
All right, everyone.
Let's settle in.

40:39.038 --> 40:40.867
So what time
is he picking us up?

40:40.869 --> 40:42.571
Like 10 minutes ago.

40:42.573 --> 40:44.369
Hurry up, we're late.

40:44.371 --> 40:48.175
It's Kate.
She's back in town.

40:48.177 --> 40:49.438
I hate lying.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.677
You would hate it more
if we missed this 4for1 concert.

40:52.679 --> 40:53.942
True.

40:53.944 --> 40:56.118
And Bobby is hot,
so you know he has cute friends.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.150
He'd better.

40:57.152 --> 40:58.853
He does.
Now text her back

40:58.855 --> 41:00.789
before she starts worrying.

41:12.004 --> 41:14.204
She's totally gonna know
I'm lying.

41:14.206 --> 41:16.006
She always does.

41:16.008 --> 41:18.182
You need to relax.
We're not gonna get caught.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.014
We look too good
to get caught.

41:21.553 --> 41:23.888
Oh, no. It's Bobby.

41:23.890 --> 41:25.554
He's stuck at work.

41:25.556 --> 41:27.027
He's flaking again?

41:27.029 --> 41:28.530
No. His mom is gonna
pick us up

41:28.532 --> 41:30.226
and he's gonna meet us
at the concert.

41:30.228 --> 41:32.162
His mom?

41:32.164 --> 41:34.201
At least now you can stop worrying
that he's some kind of pedophile.

41:34.203 --> 41:36.297
She probably drives
a minivan.

41:36.299 --> 41:38.338
I don't know,
that seems weird.

41:42.245 --> 41:43.643
Hi!

41:43.645 --> 41:45.412
You must be Meg and Markayla.

41:45.414 --> 41:47.551
I'm Paige, Bobby's mom.

41:47.553 --> 41:48.551
Sorry I'm late.

41:48.553 --> 41:50.856
You guys ready for the show?

41:50.858 --> 41:51.823
Totally.

41:51.825 --> 41:53.823
Hop in.
You both look great.
