That's more to the point.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.045
Now you're being
honest with yourself.

12:26.046 --> 12:30.083
Right.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.033
It's so easy to say I came

12:47.034 --> 12:48.868
out here because it's
a lot of opportunity.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.202
Well, that's really great.

12:50.203 --> 12:56.408
If you're not here for that,
why else are you here?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.744
It's the good old wreck
your life scenario.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.612
That's always pretty popular.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.381
You can change your mind about

13:01.382 --> 13:06.018
wrecking your life,
now what do I do.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.855
There's a lot less
self-reflection about why people

13:08.856 --> 13:13.792
are here than there is
about most other places.

13:13.793 --> 13:20.699
What a lost opportunity that is.

13:20.700 --> 13:25.571
Sinatra and the mob are gone
but there remains still a

13:25.572 --> 13:26.539
certain sentimental attachment

13:26.540 --> 13:28.607
to the way things used to be.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.609
There were rules then, a way

13:30.610 --> 13:32.078
that things were done, and when

13:32.079 --> 13:33.712
they weren't done, there was

13:33.713 --> 13:36.548
always the desert and
a hole in the ground.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.885
Also, there were lounges and rub

13:38.886 --> 13:40.452
joints and places where a man

13:40.453 --> 13:42.754
could get a proper plate of

13:42.755 --> 13:47.927
Italian American
meatballs and spaghets.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.495
Thankfully there are
still such places.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.730
Places like this, the bootleger.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.265
It's a family operation.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.968
Mama Maria's family has been
running it for 41 years.

13:55.969 --> 14:03.969
You got your veal parm,
fetucchini and shrimp.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.280

sort of and the Amalfi

18:27.073 --> 18:29.541
his might be the biggest draw.

I suggested this place because

18:31.544 --> 18:32.911
rock off the strip is where

18:32.912 --> 18:37.216
every chef I know who knows
this town said I should go.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.121
known as one of the best places

18:43.122 --> 18:46.558
to eat in Vegas,
casual but pricey.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.527
Pricey because the ingredients,

18:47.528 --> 18:49.261
many from around the world.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.430
There is sea urchin
from Santa Barbara.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.299
Okay, that's not
too far, but good.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.601
The tuna is from Spain
where it's best.

18:55.602 --> 18:59.238
The fresh river crab from Japan.

18:59.239 --> 18:59.806
That was good, right?

18:59.806 --> 19:00.072
Yeah.

fried chicken.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.320

19:14.321 --> 19:17.088
collar, where all the best,

19:17.089 --> 19:21.960
tastiest, moistest, meatiest

19:23.730 --> 19:27.233

over 20 years.

19:27.234 --> 19:27.800
He knows.

19:27.801 --> 19:30.969
The thing about magic is, you

19:30.970 --> 19:33.672
cannot see it electronically.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.575
Many people come to Vegas are

19:36.576 --> 19:38.610
people that see one or two live

19:38.611 --> 19:40.246
shows a year and if you see one

19:40.247 --> 19:42.748
or two live shows, you might as

19:42.749 --> 19:45.251
well see something that
you can only see live.

19:45.252 --> 19:45.918
Right.

19:45.919 --> 19:49.288
You can never, ever see a
magician anywhere but live.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.824
These days for better or
worse, live acts, live

19:52.825 --> 19:54.293

19:54.294 --> 19:58.297
out in favor of EDF,
electronic dance music.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.131

20:11.978 --> 20:13.645
I'm embarrassed that I
don't understand it.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.481
Are we just old?

20:14.482 --> 20:18.484
I think that might be it.

20:18.485 --> 20:19.551
I don't know.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.020
You want to spin it the latter,

20:22.021 --> 20:23.722
I'm afraid it might
be the former.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.658

20:26.659 --> 20:28.460
almost entirely in Vegas.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.695
Danny Ganz was huge here.

20:29.696 --> 20:30.062
Wayne Newton.

money draw now?

20:33.900 --> 20:39.971

horns with thine hands.

maketh it to rain.

21:06.032 --> 21:06.566
Power.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.233
It's crazy.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.768
Press a button and
people respond.

21:09.769 --> 21:14.205
They do, man.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.207
Wednesday night at the marquee.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.378

21:19.379 --> 21:21.413
Tonight at marquee and in other

21:21.414 --> 21:23.915
clubs like it around Vegas,
somewhere between 8,000 and

21:23.916 --> 21:26.017
10,000 people are going to stop

21:26.018 --> 21:32.023
by and drop a whole
boatload of cash.

21:32.024 --> 21:36.595
It's not just coming in here
and ordering a bottle and

21:36.596 --> 21:37.397
sitting there drinking it.

21:37.398 --> 21:42.901
You get a full-on
group experience.

21:42.902 --> 21:48.540
The new money, the new Vegas,
where the take at the big

21:48.541 --> 21:49.641
nightclubs is outpacing the take

21:49.642 --> 21:50.809
from gambling and slots.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.778
Where everybody for the right

21:51.779 --> 21:53.412
price and with enough sparkles

21:53.413 --> 21:57.616
and the right mix
can be a winner.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.918
After you finish work, how long

21:59.919 --> 22:03.121
does it take for your
adrenaline to level off?

22:03.122 --> 22:03.956
At least an hour.

22:03.957 --> 22:08.494
What are your dreams like now?

22:08.495 --> 22:09.895
I'm not going to lie.

22:09.896 --> 22:13.665
Sometimes I close my eyes and
I still see the strobes.

22:13.666 --> 22:18.437
Ears are ringing.

22:18.438 --> 22:23.175
Still got like flash
of the strobe lights.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.164
Las Vegas is an adult playland.

22:46.165 --> 22:49.635
And that's what we intend to be.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.369
If people want to see Mickey

22:51.370 --> 22:53.839
mouse, they can go 175
miles down the road.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.207
If they want to see bugsy Siegel

22:56.208 --> 22:58.209
under a rock, they stay here.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.846
Is there a Mr. Vegas like

23:00.847 --> 23:03.381
Elvis or Wayne Newton or
bugsy Siegel used to be?

23:03.382 --> 23:07.453
If there is, it would
probably be this guy.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.888
Former mayor Oscar Goodman.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.223
A man who knows allegedly and to

23:12.224 --> 23:13.725
the best of my knowledge where

23:13.726 --> 23:15.861
all the bodies are buried, some

23:15.862 --> 23:19.130
of them equally allegedly by
some of his former clients.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.832
We meet over drinks at Oscar's,

23:20.833 --> 23:22.468
the steakhouse that bears his

23:22.469 --> 23:25.036
name and boasts beef,
booze and braudz.

23:25.037 --> 23:30.341
Broads.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.811
Who was nice and who was
less fun to have...

23:32.812 --> 23:34.245
The truth of the matter is,

23:34.246 --> 23:35.413
all my clients were nice to me

23:35.414 --> 23:37.949
because I kept them
out of prison.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.685
Did alleged mob guys
know how to eat?

23:39.686 --> 23:41.753
My mother used to say
two things, she said.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.054
She was the greatest lady.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.389
She said Oscar's clients don't

23:44.390 --> 23:47.158
hurt anybody, they
just kill each other.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.761
And she also said Oscar's
clients take us to the best

23:49.762 --> 23:50.530
restaurants.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.498
They knew where to go.

23:51.499 --> 23:54.666
They knew where to go.

23:54.667 --> 23:55.034
Yeah.

23:55.035 --> 23:57.268
And were always treated right.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.105
They were always treated
like kings and queens.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.873
Did the feds hold
it against you?

24:01.874 --> 24:02.742
You were just doing your job.

24:02.743 --> 24:03.942
They didn't see it that way.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.813
They thought I was
a consigliere.

24:07.814 --> 24:08.447
In order to murder somebody,

24:08.448 --> 24:10.516
they had to get my permission.

24:10.517 --> 24:13.084
That's how stupid
these people were.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.521
These were gentlemen not
unknown to mayor Goodman.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.356
A lot of people tell you

24:18.357 --> 24:20.726
there's a better place when
the mob was running it.

24:20.727 --> 24:21.528
In many ways, that's true.

24:21.529 --> 24:23.762
There were rules
then that mattered.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.396
You know the old saying, what

24:25.397 --> 24:27.098
happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.601
Back when the mob ran things,

24:29.602 --> 24:34.039
there was a certain urgency
to that suggestion.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.908
Talking about with prince

24:36.909 --> 24:39.277
Harry, that's a perfect example.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.379
Here's a guy who was
here having a good time.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.448
In the old Vegas, that
would never have happened.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.416
There would never have
been a disclosure.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.318
In today's modern age it was all

24:47.319 --> 24:47.854
over the world in moments.

24:47.854 --> 24:48.154
Moments.

24:48.155 --> 24:49.921
Yes.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.422
It says something about the

24:51.423 --> 24:54.826
town that his honor served
three terms as mayor.

24:54.827 --> 24:59.798
He's unabashed booster,
entrepreneur, drinker of hard

24:59.799 --> 25:01.166
liquor and gambler and he was

25:01.167 --> 25:05.436
never shy about admitting it.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.005
It's unique.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.074
It's its own hothouse
environment.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.977
Vegas is unique.

25:11.978 --> 25:15.080
But I'll tell you one thing, you

25:15.081 --> 25:17.783
go to the airport,
everybody is smiling.

25:17.784 --> 25:20.351
They can't wait to lose their

25:20.352 --> 25:21.820
money and afterwards
they're smiling.

25:21.821 --> 25:26.024
It's a special place where
people can take their basest

25:26.025 --> 25:26.993
instincts and just let it fly.

25:26.994 --> 25:28.426
I think that's good.

25:28.427 --> 25:36.427
I have no problem
with that at all.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.839
When you come to
Vegas, you see this.

25:40.840 --> 25:45.543
The lights and smoke and
mirrors, the casino floors.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.478
But who manages the machine?

25:47.479 --> 25:49.547
Where did they come from?

25:49.548 --> 25:53.051
Beneath the floors, behind
the walls, above the winking

25:53.052 --> 25:55.854
surveillance camera lenses, a

25:55.855 --> 25:58.724
whole other world manned by
thousands and thousands of

25:58.725 --> 26:00.792
waiters, maintenance people,

26:00.793 --> 26:06.031
repairmen, chefs,
engineers, plumbers.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.566
Three shifts a day they slip in

26:08.567 --> 26:10.902
and out of the casinos almost
unseen through their own

26:10.903 --> 26:12.237
entrances but it's these people

26:12.238 --> 26:14.706
who have seen it all, seen

26:14.707 --> 26:20.545
everything, night after night.

26:20.546 --> 26:21.913
Kenny has been working here

26:21.914 --> 26:24.850
since Caesar's opened
in August of 1966.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.686
He's dealt cards to everybody.

26:27.687 --> 26:33.358
I've dealt to Diana Ross,
Harry Belafonte, Sinatra.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.426
Sinatra was not supposed to

26:35.427 --> 26:37.428
be particularly
amiable at the table.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.264
Sinatra was class.

26:38.264 --> 26:38.898
Really?

26:38.898 --> 26:39.832
He was class.

26:39.833 --> 26:41.266
He was a gentleman.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.600
But those were the good days.

26:42.601 --> 26:48.373
But it's nice now, too.

26:48.374 --> 26:54.545
Would you describe yourself
as a degenerate gambler?

26:54.546 --> 26:57.282
I'm trying to move past that.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.449
We have a 2-year-old at home.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.619
But I'll always have that
gambling gear, no doubt about

27:01.620 --> 27:01.788
it.

27:01.789 --> 27:04.856
Eric and Erica are
professional gamblers, poker

27:04.857 --> 27:05.692
players, to be precise.

27:05.693 --> 27:06.892
It's routine for them to sit

27:06.893 --> 27:08.126
down to a game with a bankroll

27:08.127 --> 27:11.062
of half a million dollars.

27:11.063 --> 27:14.900
Tonight, slightly
smaller stakes.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.401
Hey, how do you like my chances?

27:16.402 --> 27:16.635
Good.

27:16.636 --> 27:20.305
Good.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.707
That's a trained answer.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.641
Instead of actual poker, we

27:23.642 --> 27:25.443
are set up with a dumbed down

27:25.444 --> 27:27.645
for the camera version
of Texas hold 'em.

27:27.646 --> 27:28.780
You play against the house.

27:28.781 --> 27:32.117
The odds, to say the least,
are stacked against you.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.819
Oh, here's a winner.

27:33.820 --> 27:34.220
Here's a winner.

27:34.221 --> 27:37.889
Two pair.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.457
He's cutting up over there.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.726
See how easy it is?

27:40.727 --> 27:43.461
You got this game down.

27:43.462 --> 27:43.996
Uh-oh.

27:43.997 --> 27:46.898
Those are famous last words.

27:46.899 --> 27:47.767
All right.

27:47.768 --> 27:50.568
Let's put out a hundred
dollars, see what happens.

27:50.569 --> 27:51.070
All right.

27:51.071 --> 27:52.303
Now we have a pair of 7s.

27:52.304 --> 27:52.705
I want to bet.

27:52.706 --> 27:55.273
Okay.

27:55.274 --> 27:58.309
I have trips.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.746
That's going to be
pretty hard to beat.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.948
You're a dead man, Benny.

28:02.949 --> 28:03.816
I'm a dead man.

28:03.816 --> 28:04.416
I'll bet again.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.151
Okay.

28:06.152 --> 28:06.418
Two pair.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.518
Pair of deuces.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.587
Two pair.

28:09.588 --> 28:12.958
Pair of 10s.

28:12.959 --> 28:13.292
Oh, no.

28:13.293 --> 28:14.293
Pair of kings.

28:14.294 --> 28:19.130
Benny!

28:19.131 --> 28:20.165
Goodness, Benny.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.800
Huh?

28:21.801 --> 28:22.301
You got a full house.

28:22.302 --> 28:26.304
This is unbelievable.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.606
Is there a cooler
standing behind us?

28:28.607 --> 28:29.141
All right.

28:29.141 --> 28:29.976
That works for me.

28:29.976 --> 28:30.542
Thank you very much.

28:30.543 --> 28:34.645
This is what we call a learning
experience in my case.

28:34.646 --> 28:35.547
That was fun.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.515
We got away with our shirts.

28:36.515 --> 28:37.383
Let's not do it again.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.651
Let's never do it again.

28:54.300 --> 28:59.570
It's easy to find people
that will help you but

28:59.571 --> 29:01.339
somebody's got to be the one to

29:01.340 --> 29:06.544
create the mess in
the first place.

29:06.545 --> 29:10.481
Where's our metaphor here?

29:10.482 --> 29:10.983
Untangle this.

29:10.984 --> 29:12.918
This is going to be so much fun.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.485
Anthony Bondi is an artist

29:14.486 --> 29:17.555
and a born and bred
Las Vegas native.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.190
After many adventures and I'm

29:19.191 --> 29:20.859
guessing some misadventures as

29:20.860 --> 29:24.562
well, he chose to live here.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.364
To what degree am I complicit

29:26.365 --> 29:28.900
in the worst of our city by

29:28.901 --> 29:34.072
making art that
glorifies the city?

29:34.073 --> 29:36.608
I don't profit directly from
what those people do but of

29:36.609 --> 29:38.877
course, I do, because I live in

29:38.878 --> 29:42.780
the city and as that money
rolls all around us.

29:42.781 --> 29:46.417
But how do we live with it?

29:46.418 --> 29:52.123
It's not why and where the
people come from who do the

29:52.124 --> 29:53.191
grotesque things people do here.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.027
It's how do we live
here complicit in it.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.229
That's the big issue to be

29:58.230 --> 29:59.264
self-reflective about the place

29:59.265 --> 30:00.465
or you have to go and stay high

30:00.466 --> 30:02.700
all the time because
of the shame.

30:02.701 --> 30:04.435
You know, which is another

30:04.436 --> 30:10.541
popular way to deal
with living here.

30:10.542 --> 30:14.479
Is Vegas a friendly town?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.948
Yeah, because that's our job.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.283
But I mean to itself.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.450
You're a local.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.953
No.

30:21.954 --> 30:22.154
No.

30:22.155 --> 30:28.559
Not a bit.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.560
This town has never had any

30:29.561 --> 30:31.796
respect for the people who
just happened to live here.

30:31.797 --> 30:35.600
In the old day, we were
co-conspirators in those days.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.568
We weren't citizens.

30:37.569 --> 30:38.970
The new authority, the new power

30:38.971 --> 30:41.406
is exactly as anonymous
as the old power.

30:41.407 --> 30:44.475
No poll number, no access.

30:44.476 --> 30:45.843
Though it's been for some

30:45.844 --> 30:47.445
years an art community in Vegas,

30:47.446 --> 30:48.646
you know, like art that makes

30:48.647 --> 30:52.250
your life, all our lives,
better and makes us think.

30:52.251 --> 30:55.686
Granted, Vegas is a town
designed to make you not think,

30:55.687 --> 30:56.955
just separate you from your

30:56.956 --> 30:59.524
money in as pleasurable
a way as possible.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.825
So pleasurable that even after

31:00.826 --> 31:04.662
you limp out of town leaking

31:04.663 --> 31:05.631
from your... with nothing in

31:05.632 --> 31:08.799
your pockets, you want to
come back and do it again.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.168
Reflection, not so good.

31:10.169 --> 31:14.139
As a resident, what are the
general rules of survival?

31:14.140 --> 31:17.475
Don't cry about being broke.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.677
If I'm broke, it's because I

31:19.678 --> 31:20.878
threw away my money and too bad

31:20.879 --> 31:23.714
for me because I
didn't get lucky.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.516
Don't complain
about being broke.

31:25.517 --> 31:25.717
Okay.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.852
What's another one?

31:27.853 --> 31:29.187
Well, smile.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.721
That is absolutely
local characteristic.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.190
This is a service industry town.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.692
One of our roles here has

31:34.693 --> 31:36.361
always been to take away excess

31:36.362 --> 31:37.895
money from people who don't know

31:37.896 --> 31:39.064
what to do with it and who can't

31:39.065 --> 31:41.332
think of a better idea about
how to spend their money.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.568
We'll always take it.

31:43.569 --> 31:48.739
Is that worse than before?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.708
The wrong is there are people

31:50.709 --> 31:54.179
with that kind of income who
could put it to so many

31:54.180 --> 31:55.713
thrilling uses and can think of

31:55.714 --> 31:58.549
nothing so crass and boring than

31:58.550 --> 32:02.387
to wave the money in the
air and throw it away.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.255
How loathesome but within those

32:04.256 --> 32:06.657
of us who live here
is that challenge.

32:06.658 --> 32:07.126
This has always been.

32:07.127 --> 32:10.829
Here we are.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.442
You are sitting in the best

32:24.443 --> 32:26.077
Thai restaurant in Vegas by far.

32:26.078 --> 32:30.381
One of the best Thai
restaurants in America.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.849
Jet has been here before.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.351
An L.A. guy, he came out here to

32:33.352 --> 32:34.585
do four years as executive chef

32:34.586 --> 32:38.056
at encore, a Wynn
casino on the strip.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.624
He's a reigning authority on

32:39.625 --> 32:40.891
Thai food but really, everybody

32:40.892 --> 32:44.062
who loves Thai food
knows about this place.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.297
What you should order here
should only be northern.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.299
You go to the back of the menu,

32:48.300 --> 32:49.567
it's northern specialties.

32:49.568 --> 32:50.801
You come here and eat chicken

32:50.802 --> 32:53.204
with cashew nuts, I'm going
to punch you in the face.

32:53.205 --> 32:56.941
Right.

32:56.942 --> 33:00.578
Sipend is the owner and chef.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.213
Now get this.

33:01.214 --> 33:03.114
And it's important.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.749
You don't do pad Thai here.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.951
You do what they are uniquely

33:06.952 --> 33:09.054
superb at which is specifically

33:09.055 --> 33:13.791
the food of northern Thailand.

33:13.792 --> 33:20.598
♪

33:20.599 --> 33:22.900
Oh, yeah, yeah, of
course, love it.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.469
Chili dip.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.838
It's really more of like a

33:27.839 --> 33:31.776
composed room temperature salad.

33:31.777 --> 33:34.612
This is a puffed crispy rice
salad with preserved pork

33:34.613 --> 33:34.846
sausage.

33:34.847 --> 33:38.849
That's good.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.151
Jackfruit salad.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.620
Jackfruit salad.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.590
This is a pork curry braised

33:45.591 --> 33:48.359
down with garlic and ginger.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.927
This pork is amazing.

33:49.928 --> 33:50.961
Isn't that great?

33:50.962 --> 33:51.663
And that's northern love.

33:51.663 --> 33:51.963
Right.

33:51.964 --> 33:53.964
Very important dish.

33:53.965 --> 33:58.536
Oh, that looks really pretty.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.839
This is the food
my grandma made.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.343
That's perfection, man.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.945
What I love about Vegas Asian

34:07.946 --> 34:10.215
food is on one street you have

34:10.216 --> 34:12.150
the best Cantonese food, you

34:12.150 --> 34:13.684
drive down the street and
get the best Thai food.

34:13.685 --> 34:18.322
How did that happen?

34:18.324 --> 34:19.190
Gambling.

34:19.192 --> 34:25.029
But I mean, were there high
rollers who would come into

34:25.030 --> 34:28.132
town... a dude
with a $10 million

34:28.134 --> 34:29.833
credit line that wins will go

34:29.835 --> 34:31.569
eat a $10 Chinese meal because

34:31.570 --> 34:34.038
it's the closest thing
he has to home food.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.706
I'm going to eat Asian food,

34:35.706 --> 34:37.746
come back and drop $5 million
more and then go home.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.856
This is what avant gard cooking

34:51.857 --> 34:53.023
is. People think that we want

34:53.024 --> 34:54.125
to do things in a way
because we want to be cool.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.826
No.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.828
We do it because really, we

34:57.829 --> 34:59.096
believe we are increasing the

34:59.097 --> 35:01.399
value of the product
we are working with.

35:01.400 --> 35:09.400
We are giving you the essence.

35:11.777 --> 35:16.847
Tonight, tucked away in the
back of another of Jose's

35:16.848 --> 35:18.849
restaurants, behind the guys

35:18.850 --> 35:21.219
making paieia over a flame in

35:21.220 --> 35:24.889
the center of a
crowded dining room.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.357
Quiet, serene, a kind of magic.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.125
This is granted a far cry from

35:28.126 --> 35:30.195
the $1 shrimp cocktail and the

35:30.196 --> 35:33.364
all you can eat buffets groaning

35:33.365 --> 35:37.535
under the weight of
a thousand carbs.

35:37.536 --> 35:42.207
Ham and bean soup with
black and roasted garlic.

35:42.208 --> 35:47.445
The world's best,
like from Spain.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.214
Nitro almond cup, a frozen shell

35:49.215 --> 35:51.882
made from a puree of almonds,

35:51.883 --> 35:56.821
filled with almond milk espuma
and finished with caviar.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.924
You know, chef, this meal
is working very well.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.960
My palate is open, I'm
intrigued, I'm only growing more

36:02.961 --> 36:03.595
hungry and excited.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.663
The desired effect
is taking hold.

36:05.664 --> 36:11.402
If you were a famous chef and

36:11.403 --> 36:13.103
you are lured as so many are to

36:13.104 --> 36:13.805
rivers of green promised by

36:13.806 --> 36:19.076
Vegas, it's nice if you can
get yourself a playroom.

36:19.077 --> 36:27.077
Gentlemen, this is foam.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.459
He doesn't say air.

36:34.460 --> 36:40.531
Water is not water anymore.

36:40.532 --> 36:48.532
Water has a body, belongs.

36:49.675 --> 36:52.943
The truffle egg, truffles

36:52.944 --> 36:54.379
formed into an egg shape with an

36:54.380 --> 36:59.450
actual yolk suspended
in the center.

36:59.451 --> 37:05.290
I think we will be feeding
our kichickens truffles.

37:05.291 --> 37:12.630
Served with onion puree, and

37:12.631 --> 37:14.632
finished with more
shaved white truffle.

37:14.633 --> 37:18.168
This is crispy chicken skin.

37:18.169 --> 37:23.974
Sliding this off
right into my face.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.076
This is your portion and

37:26.077 --> 37:29.414
Brian is going to come finish it

37:29.415 --> 37:33.551
with a Clementine sauce for you.

37:33.552 --> 37:41.025
Gentlemen, this is
your next course.

37:41.026 --> 37:47.765
Awesome.

37:47.766 --> 37:54.572
It's a secret cut.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.508
You know the work that goes

37:57.509 --> 38:05.509
into creating a dish like this?

38:06.117 --> 38:08.719
They say the chef was not there.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.355
Then look at the food critics

38:10.356 --> 38:13.257
saying it's almost like
a lack of respect.

38:13.258 --> 38:16.193
Who do you think
these people are?

38:16.194 --> 38:23.033
Where do you think
they come from?

38:23.034 --> 38:26.971
Everyone one of those amazing

38:26.972 --> 38:28.706
sous chefs we have, they are as

38:28.707 --> 38:30.775
good, if not better, than the

38:30.776 --> 38:37.148
guys that have the big name
on top with neon letter.

38:52.798 --> 39:00.798
There is not an acre of
preserved Mojave desert in the

39:03.642 --> 39:04.142
city limbs of Las Vegas.

39:04.142 --> 39:04.776
Why would you preserve this?

39:04.777 --> 39:07.778
This desolation
is not nurturing.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.979
We can't be here unless there's

39:08.980 --> 39:11.982
a lot of technology
supporting our presence.

39:11.983 --> 39:17.021
And so there's a sense of
the city versus nature.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.156
This is not our friend.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.290
You would think looking at

39:20.291 --> 39:22.326
the vast lake, the canals, the

39:22.327 --> 39:24.495
fountains of Vegas in the middle

39:24.496 --> 39:26.196
of a desert, the flush of

39:26.197 --> 39:27.832
100,000 toilets and the casinos

39:27.833 --> 39:30.034
and what they bring would

39:30.035 --> 39:34.872
constitute an obscene
waste of water.

39:34.873 --> 39:44.181
And indeed water is at a
desperate premium as water

39:44.182 --> 39:45.950
levels decrease at
an alarming rate.

39:45.951 --> 39:49.153
But it isn't the casinos
that are the culprits.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.889
In fact, Vegas casinos are a

39:51.890 --> 39:53.658
model of water efficiency
and conservation.

39:53.659 --> 39:56.160
Main culprit?

39:56.161 --> 39:59.129
All-American lawn.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.198
A little square of green.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.534
Robert Kern is water police.

40:03.535 --> 40:06.136
He patrols the Vegas streets

40:06.137 --> 40:09.874
looking for evidence
of water violations.

40:09.875 --> 40:13.511
Saw some water in the
gutter on both sides.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.546
This is not their day.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.314
We're in an area where there

40:17.315 --> 40:19.684
shouldn't be any water,
yet there's water here.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.887
That's what we do, we drive
around looking for something

40:21.888 --> 40:23.921
like that, to give them
a little education.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.223
Hey, you're not supposed
to water today.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.058
So you don't wrestle them to

40:28.059 --> 40:29.560
the ground, cuff
them and drag them?

40:29.561 --> 40:32.162
No, we do not.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.064
Although we have a fee.

40:33.064 --> 40:33.732
How much?

40:33.733 --> 40:35.065
$80.

40:35.066 --> 40:39.037
Then it doubles.

40:41.339 --> 40:41.507
It.

40:41.508 --> 40:46.577
It seems a losing battle
to keep your grass green.

40:46.578 --> 40:49.013
Most everyone came from the

40:49.014 --> 40:51.448
east coast and everything
was lush and green.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.417
That's what Vegas
was 20 years ago.

40:53.418 --> 40:55.720
The city assigns watering

40:55.721 --> 40:58.756
days to control useage, and also

40:58.757 --> 41:00.424
encourages a landscaping style

41:00.425 --> 41:02.627
focused on drought-resistant

41:02.628 --> 41:03.861
plants and efficient irrigation.

41:03.862 --> 41:06.096
And if you don't get with the

41:06.097 --> 41:08.933
program, there's a hole out
there in the desert for you.

41:08.934 --> 41:09.901
Okay, not really.

41:09.902 --> 41:12.236
You get a notice pinned to
your door or something.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.470
But some people want the lawn?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.606
Got to have it.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.041
They can have it, just don't
water on the wrong days.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.208
How critical is it?

41:18.209 --> 41:18.777
Very.

41:18.778 --> 41:20.144
I mean, there's no snow on the

41:20.145 --> 41:22.647
western sierras, so we don't get

41:22.648 --> 41:24.214
any continued flow into the

41:24.215 --> 41:29.119
Colorado dumping into lake mead.

41:29.120 --> 41:33.490
Unless something drastically
changes in the near future.

41:33.491 --> 41:41.491
But got to stay positive.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.137
For the first 30, 40 year,

41:47.138 --> 41:51.408
you just couldn't conceive
of what was ahead.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.110
What we had, whatever was the

41:53.111 --> 41:55.312
newest thing that was happening

41:55.313 --> 41:56.081
was so spectacular and wonderful

41:56.082 --> 41:57.915
and oh, my gosh, we reached a

41:57.916 --> 42:00.651
new eastern edge, a western
edge, a northern edge.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.753
The odds are slim to zero that

42:02.754 --> 42:07.958
we're going to extend it to
yet an even further horizon.

42:07.959 --> 42:08.860
It was unconceivable.

42:08.861 --> 42:10.828
So there's the thing.

42:10.829 --> 42:13.631
The desert exceeds our ambition.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.834
In Vegas, nothing is permanent.

42:16.835 --> 42:21.505
It constantly eats itself, tears

42:21.506 --> 42:24.541
down, builds up, expands

42:24.542 --> 42:28.512
according to no known or
easily understood plan.

42:28.513 --> 42:30.014
An organic thing responding to

42:30.015 --> 42:35.686
the dark dreams of the
American sub conscious.

42:35.687 --> 42:38.322
Come frolic, live like Caesar,

42:38.323 --> 42:40.858
or make money off those who do.

42:40.859 --> 42:44.361
Drop a few moist bills
in a gas station slot.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.296
See the full spectrum of human

42:46.297 --> 42:53.104
folly and commit some
follies of your own.
