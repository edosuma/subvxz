00:11.098 --> 00:13.013
Backup team one
in position.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.189
MARTINSON:
Copy, backup team one.
We go on my command.

00:15.232 --> 00:18.148
I was working a drug raid
at this park just last month.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.367
And how much you want to bet

00:19.410 --> 00:21.151
we collar the exact same
knuckleheads?

00:21.195 --> 00:23.066
Your tax dollars at work.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.415
[gunshot]

00:27.114 --> 00:28.419
[gunshots]

00:28.463 --> 00:30.813
Shots fired! Park entrance!

00:33.120 --> 00:35.209
Police! Don't move!

[siren approaching]

00:43.260 --> 00:44.174
Police!

00:44.218 --> 00:45.262
Don't move! Drop your gun!

00:45.306 --> 00:47.134
Drop your gun now!

00:47.177 --> 00:49.179
On the ground now!

00:57.796 --> 00:59.929
[wheezing]Oh, no.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.106
Sarge. Sarge.

01:03.150 --> 01:06.066
MARTINSON:
All units, all units,
move into north field.

01:07.415 --> 01:08.459
JANKO:
Oh, my God.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.548
Oh, my God.
[panting]

01:10.592 --> 01:12.159
Sergeant Price.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.682
She was coming right at me,
firing her weapon.

01:13.725 --> 01:14.813
Central, 10-13.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.337
10-13, we have an officer down.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.121
I repeat, we have
an officer shot!

01:18.165 --> 01:19.383
Hang in there, Sarge.
Hang in there, Brenda.

01:19.427 --> 01:20.819
Help's on the way!

01:20.863 --> 01:22.299
Stay with us!Stay with us, Price.

01:22.343 --> 01:23.735
ADDISON:
Hang in there, Sarge!

01:23.779 --> 01:24.997
JANKO:
Sergeant, stay with us!

01:25.041 --> 01:26.347
Help's on the way!
Help's coming!

01:26.390 --> 01:29.176
ABETEMARCO:
Shooter is, uh,
Oliver Landry.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.178
Says he was walking
home from work

01:31.221 --> 01:33.180
when these guys
tried to rob him.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.920
What are their conditions?

01:34.964 --> 01:36.661
The guy who took it
in the gut is okay.

01:36.705 --> 01:39.099
Uh, the other guy
might have spinal damage.

01:39.142 --> 01:41.579
Mr. Landry's weapon--
is it registered?

01:41.623 --> 01:42.667
Yeah.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.147
Carry permit?

01:44.191 --> 01:46.018
Negative, but he got
a premises permit

01:46.062 --> 01:47.716
and the right
to defend himself.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.239
He wasn't on his property.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.719
And you can't shoot
someone who doesn't

01:50.762 --> 01:53.287
present a threat, like
the victim he shot in the back.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.201
"Victim"?

01:54.244 --> 01:55.767
You mean perp.

01:55.811 --> 01:58.161
From what I just saw,
there could be three perps here.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.903
Come on, uh...
Landry's just a regular schnook

02:00.946 --> 02:02.339
trying to get home from work.

02:02.383 --> 02:05.821
Hey, he's being called
a hero for taking a stand.

02:05.864 --> 02:07.170
He's also being called
a white man

02:07.214 --> 02:09.129
who gunned down
two unarmed black guys.

02:09.172 --> 02:12.132
No, they took a knife off one
of these guys at the hospital.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.177
Which was nowhere in evidence
in that video.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.266
Come on, you really
gonna charge this guy?

02:16.310 --> 02:20.270
I would like our hero
in this office ASAP.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.576
[siren chirps]

02:21.619 --> 02:23.708
[siren wails]

02:23.752 --> 02:25.232
[both sigh]

02:25.275 --> 02:26.668
This blows.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.670
We'll be at the courthouse
in a few minutes.

02:28.713 --> 02:29.671
I know.

02:29.714 --> 02:30.976
Just saying,
since when the hell

02:31.020 --> 02:32.804
do we ride shotgun
for the U.S. Marshals?

02:32.848 --> 02:35.067
The witness they're
delivering ran drugs

02:35.111 --> 02:37.461
from the Texas border
for the Ace Double Treys.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.463
His testimony could
cripple their operation.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.162
Yeah. Great.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.993
[tires screeching]

03:11.887 --> 03:13.671

Yeah.

Danny, the witness!

Addison.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.288
James.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.637
Hear anything?

04:06.681 --> 04:08.770
She's in surgery;
that's all we know.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.382
ADDISON:
That's her husband, right?

04:12.426 --> 04:14.428
Yeah, Jason. He's here
with his two little girls.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.430
Someone took them
to get some Cokes.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.563
I got to go say something.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.218
I'm not sure now's the time.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.567
I can't not.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.276
Uh, Jason?JASON: Yeah.

04:36.319 --> 04:39.453
Jas-Jason, I'm-I'm
Officer Eddie Janko.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.411
I was with Brenda
on the scene.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.891
Yeah, what--
yeah, what happened?

04:42.934 --> 04:44.414
Hi. Sergeant
Reagan, Jamie.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.589
Yeah, what the hell happened?

04:45.633 --> 04:47.374
There was some
confusion at the scene.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.418
Okay, what does that mean?

04:48.462 --> 04:50.290
Friendly fire.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.380
Friendly... friendly fire?
You guys are the NYPD.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.424
James Addison.

04:55.469 --> 04:58.167
I was on the scene, too.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.343
I think that, uh...

05:00.387 --> 05:02.519
it might've been me
that shot her.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.784
At what scene, in what world

05:06.828 --> 05:09.091
does my wife look like
one of the criminals, man?

05:09.134 --> 05:10.135
What the hell happened?!

05:10.179 --> 05:11.354
I am so sorry.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.660
Oh, you're sorry?!

05:12.703 --> 05:14.270
Hey, hey, hey...Oh, you're sorry?
Hey, guys.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.924
Doctors are hard at work.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.579
[sobs softly]

05:19.884 --> 05:22.496
So let's concentrate
on that, okay?

05:22.539 --> 05:25.499
[sniffling]

05:27.283 --> 05:29.938
[crying]

05:32.157 --> 05:33.507
[door opens]

05:33.550 --> 05:35.378
Your vehicle's standing by.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.771
Garrett and Gormley
are on their way up.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.250
[sighs]

05:38.294 --> 05:40.427
ETA at the hospital's
at least a half hour

05:40.470 --> 05:41.428
even with lights
and sirens.

05:41.471 --> 05:42.516
Great.

05:46.476 --> 05:49.174
Train leaves in 30 seconds.
Where are your coats?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.571
Boss, we lost her.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.358
GARRETT:
She died on the table.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.583
The initial report said wounded.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.542
I know.

06:08.585 --> 06:11.066
But the final report...

06:11.109 --> 06:13.111
â™ª

06:23.948 --> 06:25.646
Family?

06:25.689 --> 06:28.605
The husband and two kids
were at the hospital.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.433
"Were"?

06:30.477 --> 06:32.870
Well, still are, I imagine.

06:32.914 --> 06:36.439
Half hour, at least.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.964
You want to send word
to have them wait for you?

06:43.011 --> 06:45.013
God, no.

06:48.059 --> 06:51.149
â™ª

07:09.516 --> 07:11.518
[cameras clicking,
quiet chatter]

07:13.171 --> 07:15.260
The death of
Sergeant Brenda Price

07:15.304 --> 07:19.439
is a profound loss to her family
and to this department.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.919
She died in service
to the city

07:21.963 --> 07:24.313
and its citizens,
and we owe her

07:24.356 --> 07:26.446
our deepest thanks.

07:27.925 --> 07:30.101
I'll take some questions.
Helen.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.538
[reporters clamoring]Commissioner, can you...

07:31.581 --> 07:33.627
Commissioner, can you
confirm that Officer Price

07:33.670 --> 07:35.324
was killed in
a friendly fire incident,

07:35.367 --> 07:37.108
shot by a fellow officer?

07:39.371 --> 07:42.462
The investigation is ongoing,

07:42.505 --> 07:46.857
but preliminary evidence
points to

07:46.901 --> 07:50.905
the fatal shot coming from
a fellow officer's weapon.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.908
[reporters clamoring]

07:53.951 --> 07:54.822
Nick.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.388
Will you identify the officer

07:56.432 --> 07:57.564
who killed Sergeant Price?

07:57.607 --> 07:59.261
No.

07:59.304 --> 08:01.698
Will that officer face
charges for this incident?

08:01.742 --> 08:03.744
We can't speak
to that now, Robert.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.224
Will he or she be discharged
by the NYPD?

08:06.268 --> 08:08.357
I got this.

08:13.057 --> 08:16.496
What happened earlier today
was a tragedy,

08:16.539 --> 08:18.976
pure and simple.

08:19.020 --> 08:22.719
And the officer
who fired that fatal shot...

08:24.591 --> 08:26.375
...is not the perpetrator here.

08:28.420 --> 08:33.077
Those drug dealers selling
their slow death in that park

08:33.121 --> 08:36.690
are the ones who caused
my officer's sudden one.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.347
That is what we know.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.351
So let's please...

08:48.484 --> 08:50.530
...please...

08:50.573 --> 08:52.749
stick to those facts.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.839
[reporters murmuring]

09:00.365 --> 09:03.325
You know, you guys...

09:03.368 --> 09:05.588
a little courtesy
goes a long way.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.548
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

09:08.591 --> 09:10.854
[siren whooping in distance]

09:10.898 --> 09:12.769
Guys definitely knew
what they were doing.

09:12.813 --> 09:15.163
Block our cars,
tons of firepower.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.600
Had to be the Ace
Double Treys.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.995
I guess that's why you guys
up here get the big bucks.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.476
Who the hell are you?

09:24.520 --> 09:26.391
The guy whose prisoner you lost.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.611
Travis Wiley was captured
by the Lone Ranger?

09:28.655 --> 09:30.613
Funny. Never heard that one.

09:30.657 --> 09:31.745
Seriously, who are you?

09:31.788 --> 09:33.834
Texas Ranger Waylon Gates.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.575
Chased Wiley along

09:35.618 --> 09:37.402
the Laredo border sector
for three months

09:37.446 --> 09:39.056
before I finally took him down.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.103
So what are you
doing in New York?

09:42.146 --> 09:43.452
Came for the trial.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.933
Now I got to get
my prisoner back.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.151
Well, unfortunately for you,

09:47.195 --> 09:48.500
you have no police powers
in this city.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.764
From what I can tell,
the folks who do

09:50.807 --> 09:52.243
don't use them very well.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.420
The ADTs are one of
the most dangerous

09:55.464 --> 09:57.118
drug gangs in the country.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.468
Which might just suggest
you were a few guns light

09:59.511 --> 10:01.296
on your little
courthouse convoy.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.558
DANNY:
Well, I'm gonna suggest

10:02.602 --> 10:04.429
that you head back
to the O.K. Corral

10:04.473 --> 10:06.170
while we rustle up Travis Wiley.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.389
Sound like a plan?

10:07.432 --> 10:09.565
Well...

10:09.609 --> 10:11.915
even a blind hog
finds an acorn now and then.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.835
Well, the hat's
definitely working for him.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.578
[phone ringing, busy chatter]

10:22.622 --> 10:24.798
ERIN: Well, thank you
for coming in, Mr. Landry.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.626
Of course.We don't have much time.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.715
We have a number of
press requests this afternoon.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.978
Yes, you've been getting
a lot of attention.

10:31.021 --> 10:34.068
Hopefully, that won't last.
I'm a very private person.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.810
This experience has been...

10:36.853 --> 10:38.376
extremely unsettling.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.422
Well, you told the
police that you left

10:40.465 --> 10:42.511
your accounting firm
late last night?

10:42.554 --> 10:44.513
I probably should've
called for a car,

10:44.556 --> 10:47.516
but I wanted some fresh
air, so I decided to walk.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.996
And that's when
the two men approached you?

10:49.039 --> 10:49.997
Yes.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.477
They demanded my wallet.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.653
And you reported
being beaten and robbed

10:53.696 --> 10:55.698
in that same area six weeks ago.

10:55.742 --> 10:59.615
After I was attacked
the first time, I was afraid

10:59.659 --> 11:01.182
to leave my apartment.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.575
Being armed was the only way
I could go back to work,

11:03.619 --> 11:04.881
back to my life.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.057
We acknowledge the absence
of a carry permit.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.669
And the two men your client
put in the hospital?

11:09.712 --> 11:11.409
It was a clear case
of self-defense.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.847
LANDRY: I feel terrible about
hurting them, Ms. Reagan.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.676
But when they threatened
to kill me,

11:16.719 --> 11:20.157
I just-- I felt like
I had no choice.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.558
DANNY:
It's Ace Double Trey turf.

11:29.601 --> 11:32.604
Looks like they left us
a surprise.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.085
Let's get crime scene
down here,

11:35.129 --> 11:36.826
see what they find.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.350
They won't find anything.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.137
The weapon's been wiped clean.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.967
You handled the evidence?

11:47.010 --> 11:48.577
Didn't have to.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.536
I know these guys,
and it's not my first rodeo.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.887
Uh-huh.How'd you know to
meet us here?

11:53.930 --> 11:55.845
I've tracked every shipment
between the Zaragoza cartel

11:55.889 --> 11:58.369
and the ADTs
for the past 18 months.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.849
Trail usually leads here.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.330
Okay, smart guy. Well,
if you got all the answers,

12:02.373 --> 12:04.549
what trail leads
to Travis Wiley?

12:07.988 --> 12:09.424
Pop the trunk.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.171
[groaning]

12:17.214 --> 12:19.173
Son of a bitch.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.523
ADTs must've ordered him
to take Wiley out,

12:21.566 --> 12:22.916
keep him
from testifying.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.048
Yeah, well, that plan
didn't work out too well.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.790
Wiley overpowered this guy while
he was still wearing handcuffs.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.445
That boy's Texas tough,
quicker than a jackrabbit.

12:30.488 --> 12:31.794
Yeah, Wiley's smart, too.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.840
Kept him alive
to avoid a murder beef.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.625
Which would kill his deal
with the Feds if he gets caught.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.235
Trust me, I'll catch him.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.628
Uh, why didn't the ADTs

12:39.671 --> 12:41.673
kill Wiley when they
ambushed the caravan?

12:41.717 --> 12:44.154
'Cause they didn't want a bunch
of U.S. Marshals as witnesses.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.721
Now Wiley's in the wind.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.853
Yeah.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.638
Hey! Where the hell
are you going?

12:49.681 --> 12:51.727
I need to find Wiley
before the ADTs do.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.512
No. Weneed to find Wiley.

12:54.556 --> 12:57.298
Best way to do that
is as a team.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.779
You might know Wiley,
but we know the city.

13:00.867 --> 13:04.435
I guess that makes me the hunter
and you the guides.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.960
Well, you can call it
what you want, cowboy,

13:07.003 --> 13:08.657
but we work together.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.838
What's up?

13:15.882 --> 13:18.145
I walked the scene where
Landry shot those two guys.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.842
And?
I'm not happy.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.148
Why?

13:21.191 --> 13:22.845
Because I hate being wrong.

13:23.846 --> 13:27.023
Two nights ago, Landry
was walking east.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.330
The two guys were
heading west.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.853
Yeah, I read the report.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.768
Yeah, but, uh, Landry's
apartment is over there.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.117
So?
So,

13:34.161 --> 13:36.163
Landry says
he was on his way home

13:36.206 --> 13:38.339
when the two guys
walked towards him.

13:38.382 --> 13:40.341
But he was walking away
from his apartment

13:40.384 --> 13:42.604
when the incident occurred,
not towards it.

13:42.647 --> 13:45.607
Bingo.Why would he lie about that?

13:45.650 --> 13:46.956
I was wondering
the same thing.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.219
Till I read the description
that Landry gave

13:49.263 --> 13:51.874
of his assailants six weeks ago.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.224
It matches our two vics
in the hospital.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.010
So you're saying those two guys
didn't find Landry...

13:57.053 --> 13:59.839
Looks like Landry found them.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.276
[knock on door]

14:02.319 --> 14:04.060
You wanted to see
me, Lieutenant?

14:04.104 --> 14:07.672
Yeah. Wanted to give you
an update on the investigation.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.109
Okay.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.242
Initial report from
the Force Investigation Division

14:12.286 --> 14:15.811
states that Sergeant Price's
death was an accident.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.204
How about IAB?

14:17.247 --> 14:19.162
They interviewed
all the officers involved,

14:19.206 --> 14:21.077
came up with
the same conclusion.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.166
So Officer Addison's
in the clear?

14:23.210 --> 14:24.385
Looks that way.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.909
Good news in a bad situation.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.911
So the investigation's complete?

14:28.955 --> 14:31.609
[sighs] Not yet.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.570
IAB is looking into
the command decisions

14:35.613 --> 14:37.877
made in the planning
of the operation.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.880
I made those decisions.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.665
Keep your head on swivel.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.108
I'm gonna miss you
while you're gone.

14:52.152 --> 14:55.242
Taking a leave of absence
feels like a smart move.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.592
Get my head together.Definitely.

14:57.635 --> 15:01.813
And getting cleared
of wrongdoing

15:01.857 --> 15:04.338
takes some of the weight off.

15:04.381 --> 15:07.341
I keep running through it
in my head, you know?

15:07.384 --> 15:08.864
Like, what I could've
done different.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.605
Yeah. Don't.

15:10.648 --> 15:11.998
What do you mean, don't?

15:12.041 --> 15:13.434
It's a dead end.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.305
Don't shoot.
I'm a cop.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.524
The hell you just say?

15:16.567 --> 15:17.481
Let it go, Eddie.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.005
I wasn't talking to you, Janko.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.441
Well, now you're talking to me.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.660
Everyone's thinking it;
I'm just saying it out loud.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.488
Take it back, or you
and I are gonna go.

15:24.532 --> 15:25.750
Come on, Eddie.
It's not worth it.No.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.143
Screw you, Janko.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.231
Take it back!Hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:28.275 --> 15:30.146
Take it back!Get off me!

15:30.190 --> 15:31.800
Take it back!GORMLEY: Ten-hut!

15:31.843 --> 15:33.541
[clamoring stops]

15:55.041 --> 15:59.393
At a time like this,
tensions run real high.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.743
I get that.

16:01.786 --> 16:05.138
The usual gallows humor
falls flat,

16:05.181 --> 16:06.966
little beefs become battles,

16:07.009 --> 16:12.362
and saying the wrong thing
can cost you a broken nose.

16:12.406 --> 16:15.191
Or worse.

16:15.235 --> 16:18.020
I get it. I do.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.329
Sorry, Commissioner.

16:26.246 --> 16:29.423
I came here to pay my respects
to this house

16:29.466 --> 16:32.034
for the loss of Sergeant Price.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.864
But... I'm just
a figurehead in this.

16:37.648 --> 16:42.131
Showing real respect
lies with all of you.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.656
Respect for the job.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.398
Respect for each other

16:48.442 --> 16:51.445
as the cops
she served with.

16:55.536 --> 16:58.713
She wouldn't accept
anything less.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.457
And neither will I.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.849
Copy that?

17:04.893 --> 17:07.243
OFFICERS:
Yes, sir.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.637
[sighs]

17:09.680 --> 17:11.291
Carry on.

17:22.693 --> 17:25.914
You're handling the
Oliver Landry matter?

17:25.957 --> 17:29.439
Yes. I seem to have
drawn the short straw.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.093
I hear you may
charge him

17:31.137 --> 17:33.878
with some pretty serious crimes.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.663
How do you know that?

17:35.706 --> 17:39.493
I don't know it;
I just heard it.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.974
And what's your interest
in Oliver Landry?

17:43.018 --> 17:45.716
I told you when we met,
I'm a victim's rights guy.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.719
Well, it appears that Mr. Landry
stalked the two men he shot,

17:48.763 --> 17:51.287
which makes them
the victims here.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.681
Even if they robbed
and assaulted him in the past?

17:53.724 --> 17:57.119
There is no evidence of that,
but even if there were,

17:57.163 --> 17:58.947
he should've called 911

17:58.990 --> 18:01.341
rather than taking justice
into his own hands.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.126
But at the end of the day,
it's about justice,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.606
not dialing a number.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.651
Yes.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.653
Justice provided by the state,

18:09.697 --> 18:11.699
not by vigilantes.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.835
Oliver Landry is also a symbol.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.011
An ordinary citizen

18:20.055 --> 18:22.666
driven to the brink
by urban predators.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.712
Alleged predators.

18:24.755 --> 18:27.628
And there isn't
a separate category for symbols

18:27.671 --> 18:28.846
under the law.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.674
They're treated
just like everyone else.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.242
Prosecuting citizens
for defending themselves

18:33.286 --> 18:34.678
from clear and present danger

18:34.722 --> 18:36.637
is not the policy
of this administration.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.813
Or any sane administration.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.511
Then we agree.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.558
Yes.

18:45.733 --> 18:49.171
And if Albany
passes some version

18:49.215 --> 18:51.130
of a stand-your-ground law,

18:51.173 --> 18:53.915
then we will also agree
on a course of legal action.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.309
But until then,
I'm afraid my hands are tied.

18:56.352 --> 18:59.355
I'm sure someone out there
can help you untie them.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.183
Find him or her.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.448
When I was a kid,
the Texas Rangers

19:05.492 --> 19:07.450
were just a baseball team.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.930
Oh, they still are.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.846
But they're not much help
on a border recon team.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.413
I always thought
you guys,

19:13.456 --> 19:16.198
you know, caught bank robbers
and lassoed desperados.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.548
We still do that stuff
on the weekend.

19:18.592 --> 19:19.723
Tourists love it.

19:19.767 --> 19:20.898
Mm-hmm.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.771
Wiley's photo is
in every sector car

19:23.814 --> 19:25.468
and on every cop's smartphone
in this city.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.819
Right. Now it's just a matter of
time till someone picks him up.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.996
Wiley runs drugs across
the most heavily policed stretch

19:32.040 --> 19:33.650
of the Texas-Mexico border.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.131
He's not fixin'
to stroll down Main Street.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.785
He's right.

19:37.828 --> 19:41.005
I mean, the Zaragozas want
him dead more than the ADTs do.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.486
His best bet is to lay low
for a while.

19:43.530 --> 19:44.487
Yep.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.446
Okay, but lay low where?

19:46.489 --> 19:48.796
Wiley did five years
in Huntsville.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.015
Shared a cell
with a safecracker

19:51.059 --> 19:53.017
named Randall Bragg.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.671
And that helps us how?

19:54.715 --> 19:57.152
When Bragg got out,
he decided to go straight.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.633
Took a job
in his uncle's garage.Doing what?

19:59.676 --> 20:01.417
Changing wagon wheels?

20:01.461 --> 20:02.766
Turns out,

20:02.810 --> 20:06.205
his uncle's garage is in Queens.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.599
You two know the way to Queens?

20:14.648 --> 20:16.824
So you planned the drug sweep

20:16.867 --> 20:19.218
that resulted
in Sergeant Price's death?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.611
Yes.
[clears throat]

20:21.655 --> 20:23.831
It also resulted in seven
arrests and the confiscation

20:23.874 --> 20:26.050
of a large amount
of controlled substance.

20:26.094 --> 20:28.488
And what would you call
the loss of Brenda Price?

20:28.531 --> 20:30.490
A tragedy.

20:30.533 --> 20:31.795
The worst kind.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.623
And your decision
to have uniforms

20:33.667 --> 20:35.495
backing up
plainclothes officers?

20:35.538 --> 20:37.845
Was totally by the book.
I stand behind it.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.412
Did the uniforms know
which officers

20:39.455 --> 20:40.804
were working plainclothes?

20:40.848 --> 20:42.806
Yes.And you reviewed
that information

20:42.850 --> 20:45.461
with them the morning
of the operation?

20:47.463 --> 20:50.205
No, I wasn't, I wasn't there
that morning.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.120
Lieutenant Martinson
ran the TAC meeting

20:52.163 --> 20:53.469
and supervised the operation.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.818
And why is that?

20:54.862 --> 20:56.820
I was finishing
a report for my C.O.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.823
But Lieutenant Martinson wasn't
involved in planning the sweep.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.782
No, but I briefed him
on the operational details.

21:01.825 --> 21:04.872
We're investigating whether
your absence from the operation

21:04.915 --> 21:06.917
constituted
failure to supervise.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.789
The operation was supervised,

21:08.832 --> 21:11.792
just... not by me.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.751
And now a decorated officer
is dead.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.758
â™ª

21:31.855 --> 21:33.727
DANNY:
Looks like
somebody else got wind

21:33.770 --> 21:35.294
of Wiley's prison buddy.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.949
We got a fresh one.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.213
Take a look around.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.480
Randall Bragg, I presume.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.747
Cue the buzzards.
He's done.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.357
The Ace Double Treys
left their calling card.

21:55.401 --> 21:59.100
Question is whether
Bragg knew Wiley's whereabouts.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.144
Hey, Reagan.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.062
Take a look at this.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.503
Wiley does love
his fried chicken.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.808
Yeah...

22:11.852 --> 22:14.289
but he didn't love it
enough to finish it.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.117
Wonder why.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.953
I'm guessing
Wiley heard the ADTs show up

22:25.996 --> 22:27.389
and split through the window.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.651
[sighs]

22:28.695 --> 22:30.479
If he did, he took off
just in time.
Yeah.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.829
And left his buddy Bragg in the
other room to take a beating.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.091
That's Wiley.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.919
Boy needs to look up
to see hell.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.574
Hell is exactly what
he's gonna get from the ADTs

22:38.618 --> 22:40.184
if we don't find him first.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.760
Officer Addison
is here, sir.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.545
[sighs]

22:52.588 --> 22:54.329
Okay.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.169
Sit down.

23:08.212 --> 23:09.605
Thank you, Baker.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.652
[door closes]

23:13.827 --> 23:15.916
Thanks for
coming up, James.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.874
I appreciate the
invitation, sir.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.920
Well, I just wanted
to check in,

23:19.963 --> 23:22.009
now that the dust
has settled.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.446
You mean now that I've been
cleared by the department.

23:24.490 --> 23:28.145
Well, I have to let
the process play out

23:28.189 --> 23:29.973
before I can weigh in.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.148
I understand.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.411
How you holding up?

23:32.454 --> 23:34.674
Okay.

23:34.717 --> 23:37.067
I understand you're taking
a leave of absence.

23:37.111 --> 23:40.941
Yes, sir. Going down to
my sister's place in Florida.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.248
You coming back?

23:46.381 --> 23:47.730
I don't know.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.732
[sighs]

23:49.776 --> 23:51.865
I reviewed your record.
You're a terrific cop.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.693
Fatally shooting one of our own

23:53.736 --> 23:55.477
kind of blots out
what went before.

23:55.521 --> 23:56.826
If you let it.

23:56.870 --> 24:00.613
I can deal with the ones
that blame me,

24:00.656 --> 24:04.007
but the ones
that look at me with pity,

24:04.051 --> 24:06.053
like I'm damaged goods...

24:06.096 --> 24:07.576
Transfer to another house.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.970
Everybody on the job
knows what happened.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.754
And those looks
will follow you around

24:11.798 --> 24:13.321
wherever you go-- is that it?

24:13.364 --> 24:14.757
Yes, sir.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.324
Forever.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.025
Tell me one thing
that lasts forever.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.723
Sir?

24:23.766 --> 24:25.855
You can't.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.683
Nothing does.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.472
It is my hope
that one day soon

24:33.515 --> 24:36.910
you can put one foot in front
of the other and move on.

24:38.346 --> 24:41.741
And it is my sincerest hope

24:41.784 --> 24:44.352
that it is out there
on our streets.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.397
â™ª

24:52.665 --> 24:54.362
SEAN:
Why do I always
have to set the table?

24:54.405 --> 24:56.364
ERIN:
Because you're
the youngest.

24:56.407 --> 24:58.061
SEAN:
I've always been
the youngest.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.020
Dinner's almost ready.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.067
I'll be in in a minute.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.329
They're not gonna
hold you responsible

25:05.373 --> 25:07.070
for what happened
with Sergeant Price.

25:07.114 --> 25:09.464
Maybe they should.[mutes TV]

25:09.508 --> 25:10.900
What are you talking about?

25:10.944 --> 25:15.035
It was my game plan.
I chose the personnel.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.732
I knew the layout
of the park.

25:16.776 --> 25:19.039
If I had been
on the scene that morning...

25:19.082 --> 25:22.085
Brenda Price
would still be dead.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.131
You don't know that.And you don't know that

25:24.174 --> 25:26.133
anything would've been different
if you'd been there.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.701
But it's possible.
[sighs]

25:28.744 --> 25:32.139
Price was running toward Addison
firing her weapon.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.880
Which might not have happened
if you guys had been

25:33.923 --> 25:35.316
coming from
a different direction.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.101
And if you'd been there,
you could've known that how?

25:38.145 --> 25:39.668
It was my operation.

25:39.712 --> 25:42.279
It was my job
to ensure the safety...

25:45.282 --> 25:46.849
...of my officers.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.852
Instead, I
passed the buck.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.115
That's failure to supervise.

25:54.204 --> 25:57.120
I hope you didn't
say that to IAB.

25:59.296 --> 26:01.124
Not yet.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.175
â™ª

26:11.787 --> 26:14.137
No offense, Eddie.
It's not the same.

26:14.181 --> 26:17.140
What Dad means is
we don't eat fake meat.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.665
It's not fake;
it's plant-based.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.188
Plant-based meat?

26:21.231 --> 26:23.451
Sounds like an oxymoron,
you ask me.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.061
Like "open-minded Reagan."

26:25.105 --> 26:27.760
You see, Eddie, the thing is

26:27.803 --> 26:30.153
we're a traditional menu
kind of family.

26:30.197 --> 26:32.678
From which, no offense,

26:32.721 --> 26:35.158
you could all
stand to take

26:35.202 --> 26:37.378
a heart-healthy break
once in a while.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.727
You're one to talk.

26:38.771 --> 26:41.643
I admit, I'm one of the
biggest carnivores here.

26:41.687 --> 26:42.688
And even I

26:42.731 --> 26:46.953
am willing to give
this stuff a chance.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.129
So what are they made of?Mung bean,

26:49.172 --> 26:50.913
brown rice,
sunflower oil...

26:50.957 --> 26:53.220
Wait a minute.
What the hell is "mung bean"?

26:53.263 --> 26:54.656
Excellent source of protein.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.179
Oh, so you've had one?

26:56.223 --> 26:57.746
Oh, fat chance.
No, I read the label.

26:57.790 --> 27:00.531
The label probably tastes
better than the actual burger.

27:00.575 --> 27:03.012
No, it tastes really good!
I'm serious.

27:03.056 --> 27:06.581
And it's better for you
and for the planet.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.582
Right.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.975
All right, I'll try one,

27:09.018 --> 27:10.237
but only if Dad tries one.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.805
I'll only try one if Dad does.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.763
Gee, thanks. No.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.156
How 'bout you, Pop?

27:16.199 --> 27:17.853
No cow, no how.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.681
Oh, man.
Easy money, sister.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.117
Aw, damn.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.206
Reagan men have a
lot of strengths.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.339
Embracing change
is not one of them.

27:25.382 --> 27:28.211
Oh, come on, that's a
load of... mung bean.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.605
Says the guy who still owns

27:30.649 --> 27:32.825
the Mustang he drove
in high school.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.087
It's a classic car.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.002
Too bad it hasn't run
in 15 years.

27:36.045 --> 27:37.003
Ha-ha.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.004
Dad.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.353
What?

27:39.396 --> 27:40.789
It looks like you've gotten
your money's worth

27:40.833 --> 27:41.790
out of that sweater.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.270
It's just getting broken in.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.446
And you're the one
who gave it to me.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.491
Yeah, when you first
became commissioner.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.972
All good things
must come to an end.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.105
Okay, that's enough.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.324
I'm gonna try mung on a bun.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.412
[inhales sharply]
Yes.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.161
Well?

28:06.946 --> 28:08.512
Not bad, actually.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.123
Aw, Pop!Yes.

28:10.166 --> 28:13.604
Faint praise.
Pass the imitation fries.

28:13.648 --> 28:17.521
Well, if the D.A. wants Landry
charged with attempted murder,

28:17.565 --> 28:19.306
he certainly has
that authority.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.221
Which he's
delegating to me.

28:21.264 --> 28:24.050
Yeah. Chatwal knows
the city's divided on this.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.443
He's gonna want
a front man-- woman.

28:26.487 --> 28:29.098
There is a case for
throwing the book at Landry

28:29.142 --> 28:30.970
and condemning
vigilante justice,

28:31.013 --> 28:33.973
but the mayor is
dead set against it.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.931
Facts be damned?

28:35.975 --> 28:38.412
With the mayor, his
opinions are facts.

28:39.892 --> 28:42.155
So, how do you serve
two masters?

28:42.198 --> 28:43.939
It's a complicated set of facts.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.420
Both positions are defensible.

28:46.463 --> 28:49.336
Well, "defensible" has become
a politician's word.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.991
Last time I checked,
you're still a prosecutor.

28:53.035 --> 28:56.430
Okay, so you tell me.

28:56.473 --> 28:57.910
[sighs]

28:57.953 --> 28:59.912
Okay.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.305
Ignore the D.A.
Ignore the mayor.

29:02.349 --> 29:04.220
Hell, ignore me.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.832
The only stand
that's truly defensible

29:06.875 --> 29:09.399
is the one you yourself
are willing to own.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.755
[sportscast playing over TV]

29:20.628 --> 29:22.064
Hey.

29:22.108 --> 29:23.762
You want some advice?

29:23.805 --> 29:25.285
No.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.722
Well, I'm gonna give
it to you anyway.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.593
Don't rehearse
for bad news.

29:29.637 --> 29:32.161
If it is bad, you deal
with it when it comes.

29:32.205 --> 29:35.077
And if it's good,
you deal with that.

29:35.121 --> 29:37.558
Anything else is
a waste of time.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.433
â™ª

29:49.352 --> 29:52.399
And here I thought I was
getting an early start.

29:52.442 --> 29:53.704
Beat me to it.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.881
You know, what y'all
call barbecue up here

29:55.924 --> 29:57.578
would get you
shot in Austin.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.623
Well, you wouldn't catch me
ordering that stuff

29:59.667 --> 30:01.843
that you call pizza
down in Austin either.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.497
Fair enough.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.499
You here all night?

30:05.542 --> 30:07.631
With nothing
to show for it.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.677
Mm.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.506
You always go balls-out
like this on every case?

30:12.549 --> 30:14.508
Something tells me
we've got that in common.

30:14.551 --> 30:16.292
I suppose.

30:17.641 --> 30:20.862
Except, when I work overnight,

30:20.906 --> 30:23.778
it's because, uh, it's personal.

30:25.606 --> 30:27.303
This personal?

30:28.348 --> 30:30.611
â™ª

30:34.049 --> 30:35.921
Three years ago,
my partner Dex and I

30:35.964 --> 30:38.967
got wind of a coke shipment
coming across the border,

30:39.011 --> 30:41.013
courtesy of the Zaragoza cartel.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.754
Those guys make the Ace Double
Treys look like Cub Scouts.

30:43.798 --> 30:44.755
Smart, too.

30:44.799 --> 30:46.932
DEA was chasing its tail

30:46.975 --> 30:49.891
till Dex and I found ourselves
a trail of bread crumbs.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.024
Travis Wiley.Yeah.

30:52.067 --> 30:55.679
Travis was gonna run
the drugs to New York.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.986
We were gonna run 'em
all out of business.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.335
So what happened?

30:59.379 --> 31:02.991
The Zaragozas made the Feds.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.080
Then all hell broke loose.

31:06.821 --> 31:10.259
When the smoke cleared,
we had four dead officers.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.783
Including Dex.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.613
I'm sorry.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.398
That was the day I swore

31:18.441 --> 31:20.922
I'd shut down
the Zaragoza pipeline.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.229
Or die trying.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.885
Well, let's get to work.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.592
IAB called.

31:38.635 --> 31:41.943
Lieutenant Sloan said
you submitted a statement

31:41.987 --> 31:44.641
admitting failure to supervise
on that drug sweep?

31:44.685 --> 31:46.208
That's right.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.384
Said it was
the first time in 16 years

31:48.428 --> 31:49.603
that a cop ever did that.

31:49.646 --> 31:50.996
I wasn't trying
to make history.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.649
Well, what the hell
were you trying to do?

31:52.693 --> 31:54.042
Tell the truth.

31:54.086 --> 31:57.132
Supervising officers
cover each other's operations

31:57.176 --> 31:58.438
all the time.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.353
Yeah, but cops don't
get killed all the time.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.181
In this case, the two things
aren't connected.

32:02.224 --> 32:03.965
I think they are.Yeah? Well, smart guy,

32:04.009 --> 32:06.533
IAB disagrees.

32:06.576 --> 32:07.838
What's that mean?

32:07.882 --> 32:09.579
You've been cleared
of any wrongdoing

32:09.623 --> 32:10.972
in the death of Sergeant Price.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.843
I don't understand.The operation went south.

32:12.887 --> 32:15.411
It's not on you, got it?

32:15.455 --> 32:17.413
But if I had been there...

32:17.457 --> 32:18.893
No, no, no, enough.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.982
Your old man taught me
this Latin thing: mea culpa.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.201
You ever heard of it?

32:22.244 --> 32:24.029
Yeah, it means "my fault."

32:24.072 --> 32:25.291
Exactly.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.423
But IAB looked into
the evidence,

32:27.467 --> 32:28.816
and you were cleared.

32:28.859 --> 32:31.079
You ain't culpa.
End of story.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.515
All right?
Be thankful.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.822
You dodged a bullet.

32:40.523 --> 32:43.091
Baez is still in the crime lab.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.006
Maybe they'll come up
with something from the garage

32:45.050 --> 32:46.747
that we can use.Wh-When?

32:48.053 --> 32:49.750
Got it.

32:49.793 --> 32:51.230
Much obliged.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.448
What do you got?

32:52.492 --> 32:53.754
Wiley's grandma Wilma
lives in Lubbock.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.103
Only person
he gives a damn about.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.236
Uh, and?Our special ops group
is up on her phone.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.760
She just got a call
from the Fiesta Motel.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.718
In Astoria.
Yeah, I know it.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.461
Hey. Wait up.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.594
â™ª

33:14.905 --> 33:16.995
Ready?Yes, sir.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.648
Police!

33:22.957 --> 33:24.828
No sign of him.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.439
Clear here, too.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.919
Couldn't have gotten far.
Let's go.All right.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.271
[door opens]

33:32.314 --> 33:33.968
[door closes]

33:36.144 --> 33:38.059
[sighs]
Damn it, Gates.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.061
How the hell'd
you find me?

33:40.105 --> 33:41.758
Followed the bread crumbs
from Grandma's house.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.282
Get on your feet.

33:43.325 --> 33:44.718
Come on, Travis.

33:44.761 --> 33:46.763
You used the couch trick
in Abilene.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.549
Let's go.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.901
Don't worry, the Feds
got a nice comfy room

33:53.944 --> 33:56.077
waiting for you
at the courthouse.I'm a dead man.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.296
GATES:
Quit your bellyaching.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.080
Once you testify, the
Feds will stick you

33:59.124 --> 34:01.778
in some backwater town,
you'll meet a nice girl,

34:01.822 --> 34:03.171
have a few kids.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.434
Dead's sounding
better and better.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.480
[tires screeching]

34:07.523 --> 34:09.830
You might get your wish.
Get in and get down!

34:09.873 --> 34:11.049
Take cover!

34:13.181 --> 34:15.053
[gunfire]

34:19.927 --> 34:22.495
10-13! We got shots fired
at this location!

34:22.538 --> 34:23.670
How many we got?

34:24.845 --> 34:26.499
I count eight.

34:31.634 --> 34:32.940
Six now.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.855
You ready to get the rest?

34:34.898 --> 34:36.074
Always.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.785
[tires screeching]

34:51.828 --> 34:52.829
They're going.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.835
No, they're not!
No, they're not!

35:01.577 --> 35:03.536
[tires screech]

35:03.579 --> 35:06.539
[sirens wailing]

35:09.542 --> 35:11.239
Come on.

35:12.284 --> 35:13.937
They're done. It's over.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.244
They're all done.

35:18.942 --> 35:21.858
Where the hell did you learn
to shoot like that, the saloon?

35:21.902 --> 35:24.948
Close.
Marine sniper school.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.126
I didn't know you were a Marine.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.693
Semper Fi, partner.

35:30.737 --> 35:32.869
Hoorah.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.133
Hey. You okay?

35:35.176 --> 35:36.656
He's fine.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.875
Think your horse has one
more ride left in her?

35:38.919 --> 35:40.181
I sure hope so.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.052
'Cause nobody's dropping
that son of a bitch off

35:42.096 --> 35:44.054
at the courthouse
besides me or you.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.971
You know, you lose
that funny accent,

35:48.015 --> 35:49.582
you'd make a decent Ranger.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.585
Well, I do look good
in a cowboy hat, you know.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.120
Told you.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.427
[chuckles]

36:09.515 --> 36:11.865
Hi-ho, Silver. Let's go.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.217
[engine starts]

36:25.400 --> 36:27.446
â™ª

36:32.973 --> 36:34.104
You got a second?

36:34.148 --> 36:35.671
Do I have a choice?

36:39.109 --> 36:40.372
You're charging Landry?

36:40.415 --> 36:42.939
This office is, yes.

36:42.983 --> 36:46.116
I didn't speak to this office.
I spoke to you.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.162
I thought you heard me.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.252
I did hear you.
I heard your opinion on a case.

36:54.342 --> 36:56.910
I lost my brother Michael
to a violent crime,

36:56.953 --> 37:00.957
in this city,
in a robbery at an ATM,

37:01.001 --> 37:04.874
where they got his money
and shot him anyway.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.312
I'm very sorry.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.748
And I knew that.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.010
Then you can understand why...

37:10.053 --> 37:13.013
Yes. But having it
color your thinking

37:13.056 --> 37:15.885
on the policies of this office,
as our mayor?

37:15.929 --> 37:17.626
That a question?

37:17.670 --> 37:19.802
A rhetorical one.

37:19.846 --> 37:22.631
You must know
that I also lost a brother

37:22.675 --> 37:24.111
to a violent crime.

37:24.154 --> 37:25.982
Yes.Right.

37:26.026 --> 37:28.550
So we're both
in the same sad boat.

37:28.594 --> 37:31.597
But we are also public servants.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.164
And we can't be making things
personal like that

37:34.208 --> 37:37.603
without compromising
the oaths we took.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.868
[sighs]

37:41.911 --> 37:44.044
I still think
you're wrong in this.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.612
And that is your right.

37:47.743 --> 37:49.484
And for the record,

37:49.528 --> 37:52.922
my brother's death
does affect my work,

37:52.966 --> 37:54.620
every day.

37:54.663 --> 37:57.187
He was a terrific cop.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.928
And whenever I have
a tough decision,

37:58.972 --> 38:02.715
I always think,
"What would his advice be?"

38:05.979 --> 38:08.198
I've taken enough of your time.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.333
[door opens]

38:12.377 --> 38:13.682
[door closes]

38:13.726 --> 38:15.771
Hey, Dad? Pop?

38:15.815 --> 38:17.207
HENRY:
In here.

38:20.254 --> 38:22.212
You guys ready?

38:22.256 --> 38:24.998
Hey, we got lights and sirens.
We got some time.

38:25.041 --> 38:26.956
Sit down,
have some coffee.

38:31.961 --> 38:35.965
And, no, answer your question,
I'm never ready for this.

38:37.532 --> 38:38.707
Amen to that.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.796
One foot in front
of the other.

38:42.363 --> 38:45.105
There's extra weight,
you're part of why it happened.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.672
Mm-hmm.

38:46.715 --> 38:49.239
But IAB cleared you
in Price's death, so...

38:49.283 --> 38:50.850
end of story.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.068
Yeah, I know that.

38:52.112 --> 38:54.375
Just... doesn't lift
the weight somehow.

38:54.419 --> 38:57.944
That report you were
working on the morning of

38:57.987 --> 39:00.425
is gonna help with funding
more cops on the street.

39:01.861 --> 39:04.733
And that takes priority
over any single drug sweep.

39:04.777 --> 39:06.431
And if I'd been in the street
that morning,

39:06.474 --> 39:08.737
we might not be going
to a funeral today, you know?

39:08.781 --> 39:11.087
So now you're gonna
play the "if-thens"?

39:11.131 --> 39:12.654
Just don't.

39:14.526 --> 39:17.224
Jamie, you know how proud
I was when you became a cop,

39:17.267 --> 39:21.271
but I'm pretty sure
I told you once

39:21.315 --> 39:22.882
that I had a concern.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.146
You're pretty much
a perfectionist,

39:26.189 --> 39:28.235
and police work's messy.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.932
And heartbreaking.

39:29.976 --> 39:33.153
And nobody's gonna be perfect
at this job, ever.

39:34.589 --> 39:38.288
The hard truth is
you can do everything right,

39:38.332 --> 39:41.596
and good cops still die.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.469
When they do, you
mourn the loss,

39:44.512 --> 39:47.167
check on their family,

39:47.210 --> 39:49.299
and get back to work.

39:53.260 --> 39:56.263
[bagpipes playing
"Amazing Grace"]

40:10.886 --> 40:13.236
Eddie told me
she saw you out here.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.372
I didn't want to go inside
out of respect for the family.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.288
It's good you came.

40:21.331 --> 40:23.508
I hear you may
leave the job.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.510
It's probably better
for everyone.

40:25.553 --> 40:29.122
Best cop I know told me
you can do everything right,

40:29.165 --> 40:31.341
and good cops still die.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.735
But I pulled the trigger.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.781
I can't get past that.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.306
[bagpipes stop]

40:51.100 --> 40:52.711
Hey, um...

40:54.713 --> 40:58.978
I was in pretty bad shape...
at the hospital.

40:59.021 --> 41:00.196
I'm sorry for how I...

41:00.240 --> 41:01.763
No, no, no.

41:01.807 --> 41:03.286
No apologies, please.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.114
[stammers]

41:05.158 --> 41:06.551
I shouldn't have bothered you.

41:06.594 --> 41:08.161
I-I shouldn't even
be here now...

41:08.204 --> 41:10.903
No, no. Thank you for coming.

41:10.946 --> 41:12.731
I appreciate it.

41:17.823 --> 41:20.260
Brenda's death was, uh...

41:20.303 --> 41:22.175
an accident.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.918
She loved being a cop.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.923
She knew the risks.

41:30.966 --> 41:33.360
She always said
the job's worth it.

41:36.929 --> 41:40.323
She sure wouldn't want this
to cost losing another cop, too.

41:41.368 --> 41:43.196
