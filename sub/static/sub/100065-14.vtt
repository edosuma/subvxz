11:35.129 --> 11:36.826
see what they find.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.350
They won't find anything.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.137
The weapon's been wiped clean.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.967
You handled the evidence?

11:47.010 --> 11:48.577
Didn't have to.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.536
I know these guys,
and it's not my first rodeo.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.887
Uh-huh.How'd you know to
meet us here?

11:53.930 --> 11:55.845
I've tracked every shipment
between the Zaragoza cartel

11:55.889 --> 11:58.369
and the ADTs
for the past 18 months.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.849
Trail usually leads here.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.330
Okay, smart guy. Well,
if you got all the answers,

12:02.373 --> 12:04.549
what trail leads
to Travis Wiley?

12:07.988 --> 12:09.424
Pop the trunk.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.171
[groaning]

12:17.214 --> 12:19.173
Son of a bitch.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.523
ADTs must've ordered him
to take Wiley out,

12:21.566 --> 12:22.916
keep him
from testifying.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.048
Yeah, well, that plan
didn't work out too well.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.790
Wiley overpowered this guy while
he was still wearing handcuffs.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.445
That boy's Texas tough,
quicker than a jackrabbit.

12:30.488 --> 12:31.794
Yeah, Wiley's smart, too.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.840
Kept him alive
to avoid a murder beef.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.625
Which would kill his deal
with the Feds if he gets caught.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.235
Trust me, I'll catch him.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.628
Uh, why didn't the ADTs

12:39.671 --> 12:41.673
kill Wiley when they
ambushed the caravan?

12:41.717 --> 12:44.154
'Cause they didn't want a bunch
of U.S. Marshals as witnesses.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.721
Now Wiley's in the wind.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.853
Yeah.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.638
Hey! Where the hell
are you going?

12:49.681 --> 12:51.727
I need to find Wiley
before the ADTs do.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.512
No. Weneed to find Wiley.

12:54.556 --> 12:57.298
Best way to do that
is as a team.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.779
You might know Wiley,
but we know the city.

13:00.867 --> 13:04.435
I guess that makes me the hunter
and you the guides.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.960
Well, you can call it
what you want, cowboy,

13:07.003 --> 13:08.657
but we work together.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.838
What's up?

13:15.882 --> 13:18.145
I walked the scene where
Landry shot those two guys.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.842
And?
I'm not happy.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.148
Why?

13:21.191 --> 13:22.845
Because I hate being wrong.

13:23.846 --> 13:27.023
Two nights ago, Landry
was walking east.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.330
The two guys were
heading west.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.853
Yeah, I read the report.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.768
Yeah, but, uh, Landry's
apartment is over there.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.117
So?
So,

13:34.161 --> 13:36.163
Landry says
he was on his way home

13:36.206 --> 13:38.339
when the two guys
walked towards him.

13:38.382 --> 13:40.341
But he was walking away
from his apartment

13:40.384 --> 13:42.604
when the incident occurred,
not towards it.

13:42.647 --> 13:45.607
Bingo.Why would he lie about that?

13:45.650 --> 13:46.956
I was wondering
the same thing.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.219
Till I read the description
that Landry gave

13:49.263 --> 13:51.874
of his assailants six weeks ago.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.224
It matches our two vics
in the hospital.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.010
So you're saying those two guys
didn't find Landry...

13:57.053 --> 13:59.839
Looks like Landry found them.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.276
[knock on door]

14:02.319 --> 14:04.060
You wanted to see
me, Lieutenant?

14:04.104 --> 14:07.672
Yeah. Wanted to give you
an update on the investigation.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.109
Okay.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.242
Initial report from
the Force Investigation Division

14:12.286 --> 14:15.811
states that Sergeant Price's
death was an accident.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.204
How about IAB?

14:17.247 --> 14:19.162
They interviewed
all the officers involved,

14:19.206 --> 14:21.077
came up with
the same conclusion.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.166
So Officer Addison's
in the clear?

14:23.210 --> 14:24.385
Looks that way.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.909
Good news in a bad situation.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.911
So the investigation's complete?

14:28.955 --> 14:31.609
[sighs] Not yet.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.570
IAB is looking into
the command decisions

14:35.613 --> 14:37.877
made in the planning
of the operation.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.880
I made those decisions.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.665
Keep your head on swivel.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.108
I'm gonna miss you
while you're gone.

14:52.152 --> 14:55.242
Taking a leave of absence
feels like a smart move.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.592
Get my head together.Definitely.

14:57.635 --> 15:01.813
And getting cleared
of wrongdoing

15:01.857 --> 15:04.338
takes some of the weight off.

15:04.381 --> 15:07.341
I keep running through it
in my head, you know?

15:07.384 --> 15:08.864
Like, what I could've
done different.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.605
Yeah. Don't.

15:10.648 --> 15:11.998
What do you mean, don't?

15:12.041 --> 15:13.434
It's a dead end.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.305
Don't shoot.
I'm a cop.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.524
The hell you just say?

15:16.567 --> 15:17.481
Let it go, Eddie.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.005
I wasn't talking to you, Janko.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.441
Well, now you're talking to me.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.660
Everyone's thinking it;
I'm just saying it out loud.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.488
Take it back, or you
and I are gonna go.

15:24.532 --> 15:25.750
Come on, Eddie.
It's not worth it.No.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.143
Screw you, Janko.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.231
Take it back!Hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:28.275 --> 15:30.146
Take it back!Get off me!

15:30.190 --> 15:31.800
Take it back!GORMLEY: Ten-hut!

15:31.843 --> 15:33.541
[clamoring stops]

15:55.041 --> 15:59.393
At a time like this,
tensions run real high.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.743
I get that.

16:01.786 --> 16:05.138
The usual gallows humor
falls flat,

16:05.181 --> 16:06.966
little beefs become battles,

16:07.009 --> 16:12.362
and saying the wrong thing
can cost you a broken nose.

16:12.406 --> 16:15.191
Or worse.

16:15.235 --> 16:18.020
I get it. I do.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.329
Sorry, Commissioner.

16:26.246 --> 16:29.423
I came here to pay my respects
to this house

16:29.466 --> 16:32.034
for the loss of Sergeant Price.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.864
But... I'm just
a figurehead in this.

16:37.648 --> 16:42.131
Showing real respect
lies with all of you.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.656
Respect for the job.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.398
Respect for each other

16:48.442 --> 16:51.445
as the cops
she served with.

16:55.536 --> 16:58.713
She wouldn't accept
anything less.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.457
And neither will I.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.849
Copy that?

17:04.893 --> 17:07.243
OFFICERS:
Yes, sir.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.637
[sighs]

17:09.680 --> 17:11.291
Carry on.

17:22.693 --> 17:25.914
You're handling the
Oliver Landry matter?

17:25.957 --> 17:29.439
Yes. I seem to have
drawn the short straw.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.093
I hear you may
charge him

17:31.137 --> 17:33.878
with some pretty serious crimes.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.663
How do you know that?

17:35.706 --> 17:39.493
I don't know it;
I just heard it.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.974
And what's your interest
in Oliver Landry?

17:43.018 --> 17:45.716
I told you when we met,
I'm a victim's rights guy.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.719
Well, it appears that Mr. Landry
stalked the two men he shot,

17:48.763 --> 17:51.287
which makes them
the victims here.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.681
Even if they robbed
and assaulted him in the past?

17:53.724 --> 17:57.119
There is no evidence of that,
but even if there were,

17:57.163 --> 17:58.947
he should've called 911

17:58.990 --> 18:01.341
rather than taking justice
into his own hands.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.126
But at the end of the day,
it's about justice,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.606
not dialing a number.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.651
Yes.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.653
Justice provided by the state,

18:09.697 --> 18:11.699
not by vigilantes.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.835
Oliver Landry is also a symbol.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.011
An ordinary citizen

18:20.055 --> 18:22.666
driven to the brink
by urban predators.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.712
Alleged predators.

18:24.755 --> 18:27.628
And there isn't
a separate category for symbols

18:27.671 --> 18:28.846
under the law.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.674
They're treated
just like everyone else.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.242
Prosecuting citizens
for defending themselves

18:33.286 --> 18:34.678
from clear and present danger

18:34.722 --> 18:36.637
is not the policy
of this administration.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.813
Or any sane administration.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.511
Then we agree.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.558
Yes.

18:45.733 --> 18:49.171
And if Albany
passes some version

18:49.215 --> 18:51.130
of a stand-your-ground law,

18:51.173 --> 18:53.915
then we will also agree
on a course of legal action.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.309
But until then,
I'm afraid my hands are tied.

18:56.352 --> 18:59.355
I'm sure someone out there
can help you untie them.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.183
Find him or her.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.448
When I was a kid,
the Texas Rangers

19:05.492 --> 19:07.450
were just a baseball team.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.930
Oh, they still are.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.846
But they're not much help
on a border recon team.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.413
I always thought
you guys,

19:13.456 --> 19:16.198
you know, caught bank robbers
and lassoed desperados.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.548
We still do that stuff
on the weekend.

19:18.592 --> 19:19.723
Tourists love it.

19:19.767 --> 19:20.898
Mm-hmm.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.771
Wiley's photo is
in every sector car

19:23.814 --> 19:25.468
and on every cop's smartphone
in this city.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.819
Right. Now it's just a matter of
time till someone picks him up.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.996
Wiley runs drugs across
the most heavily policed stretch

19:32.040 --> 19:33.650
of the Texas-Mexico border.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.131
He's not fixin'
to stroll down Main Street.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.785
He's right.

19:37.828 --> 19:41.005
I mean, the Zaragozas want
him dead more than the ADTs do.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.486
His best bet is to lay low
for a while.

19:43.530 --> 19:44.487
Yep.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.446
Okay, but lay low where?

19:46.489 --> 19:48.796
Wiley did five years
in Huntsville.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.015
Shared a cell
with a safecracker

19:51.059 --> 19:53.017
named Randall Bragg.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.671
And that helps us how?

19:54.715 --> 19:57.152
When Bragg got out,
he decided to go straight.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.633
Took a job
in his uncle's garage.Doing what?

19:59.676 --> 20:01.417
Changing wagon wheels?

20:01.461 --> 20:02.766
Turns out,

20:02.810 --> 20:06.205
his uncle's garage is in Queens.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.599
You two know the way to Queens?

20:14.648 --> 20:16.824
So you planned the drug sweep

20:16.867 --> 20:19.218
that resulted
in Sergeant Price's death?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.611
Yes.
[clears throat]

20:21.655 --> 20:23.831
It also resulted in seven
arrests and the confiscation

20:23.874 --> 20:26.050
of a large amount
of controlled substance.

20:26.094 --> 20:28.488
And what would you call
the loss of Brenda Price?

20:28.531 --> 20:30.490
A tragedy.

20:30.533 --> 20:31.795
The worst kind.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.623
And your decision
to have uniforms

20:33.667 --> 20:35.495
backing up
plainclothes officers?

20:35.538 --> 20:37.845
Was totally by the book.
I stand behind it.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.412
Did the uniforms know
which officers

20:39.455 --> 20:40.804
were working plainclothes?

20:40.848 --> 20:42.806
Yes.And you reviewed
that information

20:42.850 --> 20:45.461
with them the morning
of the operation?

20:47.463 --> 20:50.205
No, I wasn't, I wasn't there
that morning.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.120
Lieutenant Martinson
ran the TAC meeting

20:52.163 --> 20:53.469
and supervised the operation.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.818
And why is that?

20:54.862 --> 20:56.820
I was finishing
a report for my C.O.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.823
But Lieutenant Martinson wasn't
involved in planning the sweep.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.782
No, but I briefed him
on the operational details.

21:01.825 --> 21:04.872
We're investigating whether
your absence from the operation

21:04.915 --> 21:06.917
constituted
failure to supervise.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.789
The operation was supervised,

21:08.832 --> 21:11.792
just... not by me.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.751
And now a decorated officer
is dead.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.758
♪

21:31.855 --> 21:33.727
DANNY:
Looks like
somebody else got wind

21:33.770 --> 21:35.294
of Wiley's prison buddy.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.949
We got a fresh one.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.213
Take a look around.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.480
Randall Bragg, I presume.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.747
Cue the buzzards.
He's done.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.357
The Ace Double Treys
left their calling card.

21:55.401 --> 21:59.100
Question is whether
Bragg knew Wiley's whereabouts.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.144
Hey, Reagan.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.062
Take a look at this.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.503
Wiley does love
his fried chicken.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.808
Yeah...

22:11.852 --> 22:14.289
but he didn't love it
enough to finish it.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.117
Wonder why.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.953
I'm guessing
Wiley heard the ADTs show up

22:25.996 --> 22:27.389
and split through the window.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.651
[sighs]

22:28.695 --> 22:30.479
If he did, he took off
just in time.
Yeah.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.829
And left his buddy Bragg in the
other room to take a beating.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.091
That's Wiley.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.919
Boy needs to look up
to see hell.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.574
Hell is exactly what
he's gonna get from the ADTs
