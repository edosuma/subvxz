00:02.625 --> 00:03.921
Okay! Let's go.

00:03.922 --> 00:06.473
This was my dream having the restaurant.

00:06.474 --> 00:09.360
And the whole thing was
turning into a nightmare.

00:09.361 --> 00:11.161
Ah!

00:11.558 --> 00:14.239
Something was released here.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.192
It was nasty, it was dark.

00:16.193 --> 00:18.698
[Speaking foreign language]

00:18.699 --> 00:21.177
Something was coming.

00:21.178 --> 00:24.538
[Speaking foreign language]

00:25.171 --> 00:27.255
My heart was hammering in my chest.

00:27.256 --> 00:28.248
[Boom]

00:28.249 --> 00:29.906
Boom! Boom! Boom!

00:29.907 --> 00:31.109
I don't want to be here.

00:31.110 --> 00:33.830
It felt like that I wasn't alone.

00:33.831 --> 00:34.883
Ah!

00:34.884 --> 00:37.157
You just don't know what's coming next.

00:37.158 --> 00:38.958
Ah!

00:39.467 --> 00:41.468
Ah! Help me!

00:41.469 --> 00:44.229
- Ah!
- Help me!

01:11.783 --> 01:14.636
We wanted to start a small business.

01:14.637 --> 01:19.437
And I was always really
interested in cooking and...

01:19.447 --> 01:20.738
Creating food.

01:20.739 --> 01:23.226
Well I think we might have found
our Monteleone's Restaurant.

01:23.227 --> 01:24.831
I think you're right.

01:24.832 --> 01:27.748
I was pretty good on the
business aspect side of it so,

01:27.749 --> 01:31.197
we figured it might be a very
good business opportunity for us.

01:31.198 --> 01:34.018
[Construction work]

01:34.217 --> 01:40.117
There was a lot of work to do so,
we started doing the demolition.

01:42.031 --> 01:43.339
[Hammering]

01:43.340 --> 01:46.229
In my mind I kind of had
the vision of exactly,

01:46.230 --> 01:50.550
what I wanted to do with the property.

01:55.192 --> 02:01.092
As we were doing the demolition I noticed
that something was stuck in the wall.

02:03.293 --> 02:05.153
Huh.

02:06.849 --> 02:09.791
It was a uh, porcelain...

02:09.792 --> 02:13.632
Uh, figurine of The Virgin Mary.

02:13.962 --> 02:19.862
You could tell it was deliberately
put there by someone for sure.

02:21.787 --> 02:26.167
So I loosened up the plaster around it.

02:27.888 --> 02:31.668
And pulled it out of the wall.

02:32.289 --> 02:34.869
[Ominous music]

02:38.594 --> 02:44.354
It was strange but at the
same time I wanted to keep it.

02:46.898 --> 02:50.918
I thought she could watch over us.

02:51.094 --> 02:55.935
One afternoon I had left
to go pick up some material.

02:55.936 --> 02:57.464
[Hammering]

02:57.465 --> 03:02.625
And it just left a worker...
his name was Carlos.

04:46.576 --> 04:50.641
I saw Carlos... he
looked kind of flushed.

04:50.642 --> 04:52.670
Uh, pale looking.

04:52.671 --> 04:57.265
He was really shook up. And you
could tell it was something serious.

04:57.266 --> 04:58.424
What happened?

04:58.425 --> 05:00.867
[Speaking Spanish]

05:00.868 --> 05:03.565
What, did something happen in there?

05:03.566 --> 05:06.114
I don't understand Spanish very well,

05:06.115 --> 05:09.873
and he doesn't know how to speak
English, so we're both... [laughs]

05:09.874 --> 05:11.888
You know trying to communicate.

05:11.889 --> 05:14.591
- [Speaking spanish]
- I don't understand.

- You got something in your eye?

- Come here, come here, come here.

05:18.691 --> 05:20.635
So I called my wife Laura said,

05:20.636 --> 05:23.967
I don't understand, quite
what he's trying to tell me.

- He says he saw a ghost.
- A what? No, no, Carlos, Carlos it's okay.

05:33.593 --> 05:35.087
Let him calm down, what happened?

05:35.088 --> 05:37.682
I didn't want to tell him
that I didn't believe him.

05:37.683 --> 05:39.278
It stayed in the back of my mind,

05:39.279 --> 05:43.258
but I was just too busy to
worry about it at the time.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.168
[Cheers, and applause]

05:45.169 --> 05:46.949
We are open!

05:46.950 --> 05:48.662
Opening day was...

05:48.663 --> 05:51.243
June 11, 2001.

05:51.577 --> 05:57.082
We were very nervous, not being in the
business before, but we were very excited.

05:57.083 --> 06:00.203
Cheese! [Camera clicks]

06:01.441 --> 06:05.079
- Welcome to Monteleone's, table for two?
- Yes.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.479
Laura was taking care
of the people up front.

06:08.480 --> 06:12.382
And I was in the kitchen,
taking care of the cooking.

06:12.383 --> 06:15.079
Let's go! Let's get them out!

06:15.080 --> 06:18.745
Here we go, hustle
out. Good, great, great!

06:18.746 --> 06:23.177
It was very busy when I first started.
I really enjoyed working there.

06:23.178 --> 06:26.834
I had my mother-in-law
there, Laura's mom.

06:26.835 --> 06:28.809
Everyone calls her Mrs. B.

06:28.810 --> 06:30.648
How's the Linguini Mrs. B?

06:30.649 --> 06:35.072
- Alright.
- That's good, let's see that sauce.

06:35.073 --> 06:37.082
Oh, that's perfect
I'll take that with me.

06:37.083 --> 06:42.605
Little by little I got more used
to the kitchen and his recipes.

06:42.606 --> 06:44.416
[Bell rings] Two up! Let's go!

06:44.417 --> 06:46.251
The wheel was full of orders.

06:46.252 --> 06:50.272
Let's get those other entrees out.

06:51.540 --> 06:56.760
The restaurant was very
popular, and it was a hit.

[Phone rings]

07:09.158 --> 07:10.231
Hello?

07:10.232 --> 07:14.216
The police are on the phone,
and they said "is this Gary?"

07:14.217 --> 07:15.559
Yes.

07:15.560 --> 07:20.133
And he explained that they
believed there's an intruder.

07:20.134 --> 07:21.853
- In the restaurant.
- Okay.

07:21.854 --> 07:25.748
That I needed to get down
there right away uh, to open up.

07:25.749 --> 07:28.329
[Alarm ringing]

07:34.151 --> 07:38.351
- You guys the owners?
- Yes we are.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.075
Please open up the door.

07:40.076 --> 07:42.986
Okay sure. Honey why don't
you go wait by the car?

07:42.987 --> 07:45.987
Go wait by the car.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.237
There was no sign of, broken
entry or forced entry...

07:58.238 --> 08:01.118
When we got there.

08:01.244 --> 08:05.024
Here, I'll shut the alarm off.

08:05.424 --> 08:10.799
It wasn't the door sensor, it was the
motion sensors inside the building.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.327
[Beeping, alarm stops]

08:13.328 --> 08:16.279
I'll get the lights.

Nope, no lights.

Sir do me a favor, go
back to your car please.

08:21.973 --> 08:24.973
- Okay.
- Thank you.

08:28.110 --> 08:32.129
Me and Laura, we were
very shook up and nervous.

08:32.130 --> 08:36.279
And were wondering, well did
they break things up inside or...

08:36.280 --> 08:38.785
What's going on and this is no...

08:38.787 --> 08:43.258
Great way to start, you know
when you just opened a business.

08:43.259 --> 08:47.018
There's no one inside. Could just be a
fault with the alarm or something alright?

08:47.019 --> 08:49.867
- Okay thank you officer.
- Have a good night. Take care.

08:49.868 --> 08:54.227
After the police had left, myself
and Laura we went into the building,

08:54.228 --> 08:58.128
just to take another look around.

09:04.517 --> 09:06.857
Looks okay.

09:07.270 --> 09:09.790
That's weird.

09:11.112 --> 09:14.249
And then we noticed a strange thing.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.797
The Virgin Mary that
was on the mantle...

09:16.798 --> 09:21.775
Um, was turned facing the wall
instead of facing the building.

09:21.776 --> 09:26.036
- You sure?
- I put her there myself.

09:28.071 --> 09:33.187
- Let's go have a look around.
- Okay, get that flashlight.

09:33.188 --> 09:34.639
[Clicks flashlight on]

09:34.640 --> 09:35.441
Okay.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.094
Gary and I decided, you know
what, let's take one more look,

09:38.095 --> 09:42.247
to make absolutely sure
there's nothing here.

09:42.248 --> 09:46.628
He went one way, I went the other way.

09:47.993 --> 09:50.453
[Eerie music]

09:52.658 --> 09:58.558
We checked all the doors in the stock
room, just to make sure nobody was hiding.

10:05.737 --> 10:08.317
[Ominous music]

10:16.183 --> 10:18.385
There was no sign of vandalism,

10:18.386 --> 10:23.985
everything was intact just as
we had left it the night before.

10:23.986 --> 10:27.766
It just didn't make any sense.

10:38.088 --> 10:40.668
[Door creaking]

10:50.642 --> 10:53.102
[Door closes]

11:06.658 --> 11:07.896
Whisper: Laura.

11:07.897 --> 11:11.915
As we're looking through
I hear my name whispered.

11:11.916 --> 11:16.296
And I thought, well, maybe it was Gary.

11:16.987 --> 11:19.867
So I keep looking.

11:22.408 --> 11:24.917
Whisper: Laura.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.302
Gary?

11:26.303 --> 11:28.508
And I hear my name again.

11:28.509 --> 11:30.955
It's very strange, it didn't
really sound like Gary's voice,

11:30.956 --> 11:33.474
but it was more of a whisper so...

11:33.475 --> 11:37.615
I thought possibly it could be Gary.

11:48.948 --> 11:51.588
[Floor creaking]

[Knocking, creaking]

Oh!

12:21.920 --> 12:24.620
[Breathing heavy]

12:24.821 --> 12:28.481
- Did you see anything?
- No.

12:32.188 --> 12:34.761
- Did you call my name?
- No.

12:34.762 --> 12:39.622
And I told her "No, I
didn't call for you".

12:55.836 --> 12:57.668
- [Bang] Ah!
- What was that?

12:57.669 --> 13:02.653
And then all of a sudden,
we had heard a real uh...

13:02.654 --> 13:06.289
Hard like pounding against the wall.

13:06.290 --> 13:08.197
[Bang] Ah!

13:08.198 --> 13:10.932
[Pounding continues]

13:10.933 --> 13:12.733

[Pounding continues]

13:32.752 --> 13:35.032
[Bang] Ah!

13:35.198 --> 13:40.409
We were both very shaken up, we
didn't know what was going on.

13:40.410 --> 13:43.219
We were both very scared.

13:43.220 --> 13:47.000
[Bang] Ah! [Electricity crackles]

13:48.138 --> 13:51.318
The pounding died down.

13:51.737 --> 13:54.562
Gary and I were frozen
in the middle of the room.

13:54.563 --> 13:58.415
Heart beating, didn't know
it could beat that fast.

13:58.416 --> 14:00.696
Frightened.

14:01.448 --> 14:03.968
[Crashing] Ah!

14:05.117 --> 14:07.895
The register's running,
and it's running a report.

14:07.896 --> 14:09.696
Ah!

14:10.033 --> 14:11.759
And then all of a sudden,

14:11.760 --> 14:15.640
it was like somebody had grabbed
the tape coming out of the register.

14:15.641 --> 14:19.606
And it was going
straight across the room.

14:19.607 --> 14:22.127
[Paper flying]

14:22.378 --> 14:25.525
Neither one of us was near the register.

14:25.526 --> 14:27.326
Ah!

14:29.812 --> 14:31.612
Ah!

14:33.131 --> 14:35.842
Whatever it was let go of the tape,

14:35.843 --> 14:41.743
the tape fell to the floor, and
the register stopped running.

14:48.459 --> 14:52.299
No explanation for it whatsoever.

15:03.317 --> 15:08.484
These odd things were happening,
but it wasn't really interfering,

15:08.485 --> 15:10.894
with the business itself.

15:10.895 --> 15:13.059
[Car horn]

15:13.060 --> 15:18.409
In the back of my mind I always figured
if the business went very well that uh...

15:18.410 --> 15:20.665
That we would expand.

15:20.666 --> 15:24.668
We were looking at the property next
door, but it was occupied at the time.

15:24.669 --> 15:30.569
We figured, whenever it becomes
available that's what we want to do.

15:30.806 --> 15:35.126
So we ahead and purchased the property.

15:38.234 --> 15:41.581
We were really excited about
the expansion, a bigger area...

15:41.582 --> 15:47.482
A little more entertainment, a bar
area, a little bit of dancing maybe.

15:48.211 --> 15:54.111
[Coughing] In the corner there
was like... a room within a room.

15:55.278 --> 16:00.318
There was no door, or
anything to get in there.

16:03.211 --> 16:05.366
So I decided to get a hammer.

16:05.367 --> 16:06.832
[Hammering]

16:06.833 --> 16:09.225
And I stared making a hole in the wall.

16:09.226 --> 16:11.960
[Hammering continues]

16:11.961 --> 16:17.021
And I was hammering and hammering, and the
plaster was falling down and as I took...

16:17.022 --> 16:20.442
A section it made a hole.

16:25.783 --> 16:29.283
And I stuck my head
kind of in the hole...

16:29.284 --> 16:30.603
[Gasps]

16:30.604 --> 16:33.201
And I could see a face.

16:33.202 --> 16:39.102
Little bit startled but I didn't
know quite what... what it was.

16:50.497 --> 16:54.637
And I pulled this picture frame out.

16:55.482 --> 16:59.442
And the face was The Virgin Mary.

16:59.497 --> 17:03.468
And I was trying to figure
out, why would they...

17:03.469 --> 17:05.901
Put this picture in there.

17:05.902 --> 17:09.342
And then build these
two walls around it.

17:09.343 --> 17:12.509
I thought well maybe
there's something else.

17:12.510 --> 17:18.025
So I started with my hands,
kind of digging through the dirt.

17:18.026 --> 17:20.006
[Bang]

17:25.162 --> 17:28.053
And I pulled out something...

17:28.054 --> 17:31.663

36:11.696 --> 36:12.632
[Sobbing]

36:12.633 --> 36:16.403
She jumped at us, and
she was just hysterical.

36:16.404 --> 36:19.579
She was crying, and pale, and...

36:19.580 --> 36:23.125
Just shaking, her
whole body just shakes.

36:23.126 --> 36:24.806

36:41.975 --> 36:43.655
_.

36:45.649 --> 36:49.301
We were all ready to,
just run out of there

36:49.302 --> 36:55.182
I called Gary and Laura, and
I told them what had happened.

36:57.198 --> 37:00.991
After I got off the phone with my
mom, we were frightened as well.

37:00.992 --> 37:04.061
Not knowing what was
going to happen next.

37:04.062 --> 37:08.897
I had a sense of dread, I
knew for sure that there was...

37:08.898 --> 37:12.846
Something going on that,
I had no control over.

37:12.847 --> 37:15.307
Okay, thanks.

37:18.698 --> 37:20.970
We definitely needed some help.

37:20.971 --> 37:25.171
And we had no idea where to get it.

37:27.367 --> 37:29.206
I think we need to talk to him.

37:29.207 --> 37:30.819
We waited till everyone left,

37:30.820 --> 37:33.910
because we wanted to talk to them, we
wanted to make sure everything was okay.

37:33.911 --> 37:37.383
We didn't want to say anything
in front of the other patrons.

37:37.384 --> 37:39.756
Diana and Robert Calamia.

37:39.757 --> 37:43.401
They're regular customers
of the restaurant.

37:43.402 --> 37:48.882
It was a huge sigh of relief, when the
Calamia's asked us what was going on.

37:48.883 --> 37:54.783
I thought possibly, if anybody
could help us it would be them.

37:55.400 --> 38:01.074
Diana has been a local psychic
here in El Paso for many years.

38:01.075 --> 38:06.975
Things had taken a darker twist and they
were just frightened, and they were scared.

38:07.305 --> 38:10.572
It was nasty, it was dark.

38:10.573 --> 38:13.175
Let's go back over the details,
and let's be really specific here.

38:13.176 --> 38:14.142
Oh, okay.

38:14.143 --> 38:19.025
So I started from when we
were doing the construction.

38:19.026 --> 38:24.926
I remembered the photographs, and the
documents I found in the secret room.

38:34.379 --> 38:36.299
Yeah.

38:38.268 --> 38:43.411
When I first saw the certificate,
and I read "Spiritualist Church".

38:43.412 --> 38:48.212
I thought oh, my God,
I can't believe this.

38:50.509 --> 38:52.346
- 1923.
- Wow.

38:52.347 --> 38:54.170
- See the altar?
- Yup.

38:54.171 --> 38:57.131
This little Italian
restaurant was sitting,

38:57.132 --> 39:00.193
on property that once
was a Spiritualist Church.

39:00.194 --> 39:03.314
Back in the twenty's.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.248
Diana and I looked at each other.

39:06.249 --> 39:10.302
And it was then that Diana turned
to Gary and Laura and said...

39:10.303 --> 39:13.986
Well, now I know what we're
dealing with, and I believe...

39:13.987 --> 39:16.963
She explained to me that in this
very room we were sitting in,

39:16.964 --> 39:21.373
the Spiritualist's performed
seance's, to communicate with the dead.

39:21.374 --> 39:24.194
[Metronome ticking]

39:29.892 --> 39:33.068
It's a human nature thing,
that we want to talk to our,

39:33.069 --> 39:35.476
our loved-ones that have crossed over.

39:35.477 --> 39:39.288
And that was a real core belief
of the Spiritualist Church.

39:39.289 --> 39:42.649
[Speaking foreign language]

39:56.125 --> 39:58.705
[Air whooshing]

39:58.962 --> 40:02.387
It's not a wonder Gary's
been having problems.

40:02.388 --> 40:04.712
Something was released here.

40:04.713 --> 40:08.073
[Speaking foreign language]

40:13.870 --> 40:16.090
[Pounding]

40:19.757 --> 40:21.737
[Roar]

40:32.904 --> 40:35.184
[Hammering]

40:37.626 --> 40:42.859
The Spiritualist's had placed those
items into this room to close the portal.

40:42.860 --> 40:45.170
To uh, to seal it.

40:45.171 --> 40:49.457
Gary and Laura needed to return the items,
because they needed to close the door.

40:49.458 --> 40:51.225
Fill this space with pure light.

40:51.226 --> 40:55.025
So when they bury these items together,
it's the photograph, is one lock.

40:55.026 --> 40:55.829
[Lock clicking]

40:55.830 --> 40:57.650
Certificate is another
lock. [Lock clicking]

40:57.651 --> 41:01.551
Another photograph. [Lock clicking]

41:02.590 --> 41:05.756
Diana told them, she
believed a cleansing,

41:05.757 --> 41:08.661
they call it a "Limpia"
here on the border.

41:08.662 --> 41:09.891
Should be initiated.

41:09.892 --> 41:12.371
Protection, of the light.

41:12.372 --> 41:15.933
And we are thankful that
this area in now cleansed.

41:15.934 --> 41:18.435
And will remain cleansed.

41:18.436 --> 41:21.241
For all of eternity.

41:21.242 --> 41:24.902
[Indistinct conversation, music]

41:30.368 --> 41:34.259
As soon as we took the objects
back to the other building,

41:34.260 --> 41:38.160
it was a total different feeling.

41:38.883 --> 41:41.854
The air just felt so
much lighter in there.

41:41.855 --> 41:44.975
It was a happy place.

41:45.154 --> 41:49.120
At the beginning I was
definitely a non-believer.

41:49.121 --> 41:51.946
But there's definitely uh...

41:51.947 --> 41:57.847
Definitely things out there that... that
I believe in now, that I never did before.
