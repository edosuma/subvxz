02:27.853 --> 02:31.050
OK, welcome to the Jimmy Stewart.

02:34.574 --> 02:37.104
Aye, we lost one a couple of hours ago.

02:37.603 --> 02:40.157
Mr McGould. Nice guy.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.895
Hello, darling. We've got
a new recruit, Jamie McCain.

02:46.931 --> 02:49.136
Hi. We've been expecting you.

02:49.172 --> 02:50.726
If you just give us a couple of minutes?

02:52.520 --> 02:55.607
- McGould was how old, 70?
- 62.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.645
Christ, that's no age!

02:57.680 --> 02:59.267
- Still played five-a-side.
- Really?

02:59.640 --> 03:00.906
Patients talk to me.

03:01.008 --> 03:03.135
Oh, don't worry about it,
we can train that out of you.

03:03.171 --> 03:04.374
It's just a knack.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.685
It's a real shame we
couldn't do more for him.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.725
Well, we tried,

03:07.760 --> 03:10.488
but the smoking and drinking
caught up with him in the end.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.745
Don't take it too personally.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.340
When I was your age, I thought
I could save everyone, too.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.600
Right, shall we?

03:29.900 --> 03:33.460
OK, let's slide on three.
One, two, three.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.865
You'll be OK, son, seriously.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.033
They're good people.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.205
He's not exactly a sparkling
conversationalist.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.991
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Usually get there in the end.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.320
Always get there in the end.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.540
Man down!

04:01.607 --> 04:02.777
Hello, Jamie.

04:03.695 --> 04:05.464
My name's Dr Watson.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.400
Don't worry, I've heard all the jokes.

04:08.600 --> 04:14.347
You'll be flat on your back
for today at least, I'm afraid.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.939
Then we'll run some further assessments,

04:16.975 --> 04:19.899
and hopefully we can begin
physiotherapy as soon as possible.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.573
Don't worry, you're in safe hands now.

04:24.079 --> 04:27.005
Well, it's natural to feel a little
disorientated when you first arrive,

04:27.041 --> 04:29.801
but you'll find us all
very approachable.

04:32.580 --> 04:37.130
Great. Right, well,
we'll talk later. Thanks.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.899
I've a package for some lucky soul.

05:02.480 --> 05:06.085
I think he's disgusting, but my
sister's obsessed for some reason.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.245
I just don't know what to do.
Like, I've dropped...

05:09.280 --> 05:12.013
- I've told him to come see me...
- And what do I find, hmm?

05:12.227 --> 05:15.598
Just our bin, stuffed full
of his crap. Huh?

05:16.252 --> 05:19.332
And was it properly sorted? Was it hell!

05:26.301 --> 05:29.657
Is that your mum?
Cos it looks like your mum!

05:29.693 --> 05:31.725
- Arseholes!
- Oh, get lost, Danny.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.005
You shouldnae be watching
that stuff. I'm taking it.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.134
Hey, what the hell?!

05:35.382 --> 05:36.907
You little prick!

05:36.943 --> 05:38.008
Leave him alone.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.630
You say something?

05:41.970 --> 05:43.549
I said, leave him alone.

05:43.585 --> 05:45.865
Huh! What are you going
to do about it, mate?

05:50.980 --> 05:52.100
Thought not.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.309
Try that again
and I'll break your arms as well.

05:58.607 --> 05:59.667
Yep.

06:02.716 --> 06:04.021
Arseholes!

06:04.733 --> 06:06.218
Might need an X-ray.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.692
Did you know a sprain can take
as long to heal as a broken bone?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.151
Thanks, though.
You didn't have to do that.

06:14.851 --> 06:16.549
I didn't DO anything.

06:16.917 --> 06:20.081
You're that army guy, aren't you?
What regiment? I know them all.

06:20.117 --> 06:23.373
Rifles, Paras, Commandos.
I had a wall chart when I was a kid.

06:23.409 --> 06:24.428
I don't want to talk about it.

06:24.464 --> 06:27.549
Engineers, Cavalry. That's tanks
now, though, not horses.

06:27.585 --> 06:29.279
I said, I don't want to talk about it.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.717
Right. OK. Sorry.

06:35.899 --> 06:37.360
What level are you?

06:37.760 --> 06:38.960
Where's your lesion?

06:41.480 --> 06:43.805
T6. Fracture.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.108
Complete or partial?

06:45.144 --> 06:47.504
The cord injury, is it a complete
or partial transection?

06:49.556 --> 06:50.583
Partial.

06:50.990 --> 06:53.679
Good. That significantly
improves your prognosis.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.205
Are you writing all this down?

06:57.440 --> 06:59.445
Yeah. I need to keep
my records up to date.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.222
Any other medication? Are you a smoker?

07:01.258 --> 07:02.480
Who are you?

07:03.525 --> 07:05.639
Oh. Er... I'm Danny. Danny Adams.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.878
T6, also partial. So we're, like,
the same, spinal twins.

07:14.018 --> 07:17.744
It's important.
You help me, I'll help you.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.146
Be your eyes.

07:19.182 --> 07:21.900
But first, I need to understand
your risks.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.176
We all have to be careful in here.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.897
There was one last night,
James McGould. 62, C5, complete.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.980
Hi, Danny.

07:36.815 --> 07:38.397
Is he annoying you?

07:38.759 --> 07:41.283
Um... we were talking about,
er... football.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.045
Right. Well, Jamie's just arrived,

07:44.080 --> 07:46.711
so maybe just give him a little bit
of time to, you know,

07:46.747 --> 07:48.101
get his bearings.

07:48.137 --> 07:49.997
Right, OK. All right, Debbie.

07:50.033 --> 07:51.961
- I was just trying to be friendly.
- OK.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.972
Sorry. Danny's, er...

07:57.009 --> 07:59.362
Well, he's harmless.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.620
And lonely.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.222
No visitors today, then?

08:09.080 --> 08:11.280
Your family or friends?

08:16.520 --> 08:19.365
Well, if you need something,
just give me a buzz.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.720
I'm so sorry about this!

08:24.318 --> 08:28.605
Right! How many times have I told
you about this? It's disgusting!

08:28.641 --> 08:30.419
Right, you, out, now! Go on!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.335
Sake!

08:32.371 --> 08:33.321
Later, Matt!

08:40.049 --> 08:43.174
Do you think it's true, that he's SAS?

08:43.883 --> 08:47.045
I've really got no idea.
Could always ask him.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.567
He won't talk about the army.
He doesn't want to speak to me.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.570
We're working on him.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.027
As a post-registration junior doctor,

08:55.063 --> 08:57.609
you have unlimited access
to his medical records.

08:57.645 --> 08:59.965
I also have a duty of confidentiality.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.125
He's my friend. He helped me.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.425
Then you should definitely just ask him.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.057
He won't admit it,
you're not allowed to.

09:08.093 --> 09:09.559
Even to their friends?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.700
I don't make the rules.
It's because of national security.

09:19.822 --> 09:20.674
Oh!

09:20.710 --> 09:23.845
Hi. Sorry. Looks like we're both late.
Naughty step awaits.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.605
- There was a new arrival.
- Whereas I have no excuse.

09:27.154 --> 09:29.445
You haven't seen my ID card,
have you? I can't find it anywhere.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.092
No. Sorry. Er...

09:31.440 --> 09:33.325
I pin mine, it's more secure.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.155
Also, I was going to mention your ring.

09:35.858 --> 09:37.837
Personal jewellery on the unit.

09:38.261 --> 09:39.393
Yeah, I know, officially, I...

09:39.429 --> 09:41.329
Infection control guidelines
are pretty clear.

09:41.365 --> 09:43.490
If medical staff members
don't obey the rules,

09:43.526 --> 09:46.207
then it sort of sends the wrong
message, don't you think?

09:46.991 --> 09:48.091
After you.

09:51.768 --> 09:53.533
Apologies, everyone.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.739
Got tied up in the ward.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.877
They say there's no rest for the wicked.

09:58.176 --> 09:59.828
What are you suggesting, Doctor?

10:00.350 --> 10:04.694
Now, I'm sure you're all aware
that we had a death last night.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.755
Mr McGould. Obviously, there will be
a postmortem,

10:08.791 --> 10:11.843
which will no doubt reveal
the cause of death.

10:12.557 --> 10:15.082
Right, well, let's start
with our new admission,

10:15.118 --> 10:16.763
Corporal James McCain.

10:16.799 --> 10:19.684
I understand he prefers
to be known as Jamie.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.885
Serving soldier,
injured in the line of duty.

10:22.921 --> 10:26.179
Medevac'd back to the UK post-surgery.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.724
The military hospital
has no beds at the mo,

10:28.760 --> 10:31.496
so we are stepping into the breach,
as it were.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.632
Luckily, the vest he was wearing
prevented serious injury,

10:34.668 --> 10:39.010
but our major issue
is the thoracic fracture.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.536
So, what happened?

10:40.633 --> 10:41.607
No idea.

10:41.643 --> 10:44.168
- Function?
- Now paraplegic.

10:44.204 --> 10:47.869
Limited ability in the arms,
nothing in the legs.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.565
He's still in the spinal-shock phase,

10:50.600 --> 10:53.285
so there's a real chance
of rapid recovery.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.069
And you've discussed all this with him?

10:55.513 --> 10:57.902
I tried. He blanked me.

10:58.566 --> 11:00.238
So has he said anything at all?

11:00.274 --> 11:02.186
Barely a word since he arrived.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.125
I fear we may be in for
a wee struggle there.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.485
Lots of anger and resistance.

11:07.722 --> 11:10.993
I think we're still deep
in a certain Egyptian river.

11:16.230 --> 11:18.075
- Denial?
- Exactly.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.925
I'm here all week, folks.

11:20.118 --> 11:21.725
Right, moving on.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.245
Our resident eccentric, Danny Adams.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.565
- Has there been a home visit?
- Yes, all done.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.405
Just waiting on a few more aids
to be installed

11:30.440 --> 11:32.797
- and then he's good to go.
- What's it like, the flat?

11:32.833 --> 11:35.670
Well, Sheena said it was basically
a shrine to Doctor Who.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.302
- I approve.
- It's interesting,

11:38.562 --> 11:40.967
but not unusual for someone
on the autistic spectrum.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.928
Mm. Which explains quite a lot
of his more challenging aspects.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.744
Er... I like sci-fi.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.164
What does that make me?

11:48.337 --> 11:52.053
The person who he relates to,
for which we're all grateful.

11:52.408 --> 11:56.373
- So, three more days for Danny, agreed?
- Mm-hm.

11:56.953 --> 12:00.045
Before we go, I am sure
we would all like to offer

12:00.080 --> 12:02.645
our formal congratulations
to Zoe and Alex.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.791
A little bird tells me
a date has finally been set.

12:04.827 --> 12:07.552
8th June. Obviously, you're all invited.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.919
Evening do. The ceremony's just family.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.925
Well, I, for one,
can't wait to celebrate

12:12.960 --> 12:16.317
the end of Scotland's longest ever
engagement. Congratulations.

12:32.060 --> 12:34.949
I wanted to say thanks
for standing up for me.

12:35.080 --> 12:39.320
I'm going home soon,
and I wanted you to have my plant.

12:40.536 --> 12:42.141
It's a Venus flytrap.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.896
I've been watching it for ages.
I've never seen it catch anything,

12:44.932 --> 12:46.872
but maybe you'll be lucky.

12:50.211 --> 12:54.953
It, um... it does get easier, all this.

12:55.882 --> 12:58.042
Y-Y-You do get used to it.

12:59.141 --> 13:00.173
Sure.

13:02.020 --> 13:06.265
It's, er... it's OK to be scared. I was.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.531
I'm not scared.

13:08.699 --> 13:12.016
Maybe you're not, but I'm going home
soon, you'll be on your own.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.695
So it's important that you listen to me.

13:14.840 --> 13:18.525
You're still weak. I won't be able
to help you any more.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.246
I really don't know
what you're on about.

13:20.414 --> 13:23.254
That's what I'm trying to explain.
Look...

13:26.569 --> 13:29.374
I'm only showing you this
for your own protection.

13:29.560 --> 13:34.642
See, base mortality remains steady
across similar institutions.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.982
The UK is in blue, Europe's in green

13:38.018 --> 13:41.063
and the rest of the world is
in cyan, which is like a light blue.

13:41.128 --> 13:43.888
But this place, this place is in red.

13:45.019 --> 13:46.142
You know what?

13:46.799 --> 13:48.439
Maths was never my strong point.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.325
You're going to have to trust me.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.685
Data never lies.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.685
We are a significant outlier.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.005
- Mortality spikes way above average.
- Danny?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.005
You know, patient profiles
don't make sense.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.283
Young people are dying,
but the real question is, why?

14:06.319 --> 14:08.839
Danny, what are you trying to say?

14:09.919 --> 14:11.925
There's only one thing
that fits the data,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.604
angel of death.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.448
There's a killer on the ward.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.823
- A killer on the ward?
- I've done the research.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.765
Er... there was a case in Manchester,
it happened in Spain.

14:23.800 --> 14:27.325
Do you remember Shipman?
Most prolific murderer in history.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.777
- UK, definitely!
- I want you to leave me alone.

14:29.813 --> 14:31.302
They all think I'm eccentric.

14:31.862 --> 14:33.987
I hear them talking about me.

14:34.023 --> 14:36.188
No-one would believe me.

14:36.224 --> 14:39.429
But they'll trust you,
you're in the army.

14:39.949 --> 14:41.868
That's why I need you to have this.

14:43.519 --> 14:45.959
- It's got everything on it.
- Hey!

14:47.333 --> 14:49.253
He's bothering me, again!

15:06.380 --> 15:07.400
Danny?

15:52.140 --> 15:53.165
Hey.

15:55.048 --> 15:56.253
You OK?

15:59.717 --> 16:00.803
Help!

16:02.733 --> 16:03.945
Help!

16:27.562 --> 16:28.962
Oh! Shit!

16:34.667 --> 16:35.834
Help!

16:37.581 --> 16:38.857
Help!

17:18.426 --> 17:20.666
- Everything OK?
- Not me, him.

17:25.097 --> 17:26.737
We need some help here!

17:31.426 --> 17:32.631
OK, Matty, it's OK.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.147
He's seizing. I need an IV quick.
20 diazepam.

18:39.931 --> 18:42.421
OK, so let's add in another
dose of Baclofen in the evening.

18:42.457 --> 18:43.486
No problem.

18:46.179 --> 18:48.407
Hi. Hey!

18:52.785 --> 18:56.465
- How's Matt?
- ICU. They're scanning him now.

18:56.967 --> 19:00.632
Was there something in his leg?
I saw you pull it out.

19:00.668 --> 19:03.233
Pair of scissors. One of the nurses
must've left them in his bed

19:03.269 --> 19:05.621
and he rolled on them.
That's what caused the AD.

19:05.913 --> 19:08.678
You get some kind of problem
below the level of your paralysis,

19:09.026 --> 19:11.487
a blocked catheter, pressure sore,

19:11.894 --> 19:13.810
you can't feel it, but your body can.

19:14.116 --> 19:16.921
Causes a massive rush of adrenaline,
blood pressure goes way up.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.592
And that's what happened to Matt.

19:19.327 --> 19:21.845
At the Paralympics, some athletes
do it on purpose.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.259
A needle in the thigh
before a race or a match,

19:24.403 --> 19:26.178
a little stimulation jacks you up,

19:26.214 --> 19:29.690
makes you stronger and faster.
But if it gets too much...

19:30.907 --> 19:33.717
It's a good job you spotted him.
You might have saved his life.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.192
Unfortunately, it's not the
first time this has happened.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.293
You have to be careful.

19:39.871 --> 19:41.716
The nurses will check your beds
at night,

19:42.080 --> 19:43.887
but you need to be alert to the risks.

19:44.168 --> 19:45.378
So this was an accident?

19:45.793 --> 19:47.940
- Sure. Of course.
- Do you get a lot?

19:48.398 --> 19:51.038
We've had our fair share lately,
but we do our best.

19:52.119 --> 19:54.460
I didn't realise being a cripple
was so dangerous.

19:56.961 --> 20:00.119
Sometimes people find it hard
to accept their reality's changed.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.155
Hm!

20:02.794 --> 20:04.060
I can relate.

20:06.657 --> 20:08.188
They told me you didn't talk.

20:13.805 --> 20:15.319
I'm trying my best.

20:17.922 --> 20:19.600
You should try and chat to Danny.

20:20.273 --> 20:21.878
Army is one of his obsessions.

20:22.367 --> 20:24.154
He'd love to hear some war stories.

20:24.252 --> 20:25.520
Not a lot to tell.

20:26.166 --> 20:27.175
Sorry.

20:27.629 --> 20:28.769
Maybe you don't want to.

20:29.620 --> 20:30.738
I get it.

20:31.682 --> 20:33.447
Whenever people find out I'm a doctor,

20:33.483 --> 20:35.368
they love to tell me
all their medical problems.

20:35.911 --> 20:39.217
Piles, their battle
with venereal disease.

20:39.563 --> 20:41.246
You name it, they'll talk about it.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.570
Sorry, I missed out on VD.

20:45.602 --> 20:47.449
- Terrible piles, though.
- Hm!

20:49.557 --> 20:50.773
So, you sleeping?

20:53.488 --> 20:54.852
Not so much.

20:55.291 --> 20:58.327
I could give you something,
if you like, just to make it easier.

21:03.660 --> 21:04.680
Why not?

21:40.013 --> 21:42.066
- Thanks.
- No problem.

21:42.705 --> 21:44.270
I'm Zoe, by the way.

21:45.026 --> 21:46.161
Jamie.

21:47.284 --> 21:49.289
Sorry. Zoe, have you got a minute?

21:49.661 --> 21:51.307
- It's about Mr Carrick.
- Sure.

22:05.902 --> 22:07.067
Hi, Campbell.

22:07.684 --> 22:09.285
Yes, I'm looking at it now.

22:09.320 --> 22:12.876
McGould, sixties, smoker,
liked to drink.

22:14.230 --> 22:15.815
Yep, that's the one.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.979
Yes, well, I'm happy to sign off
on it if you are.

23:09.547 --> 23:12.832
So, they really minced this bastard, eh?
Mental, innit?

23:13.040 --> 23:14.589
He were just having a shit,

23:14.625 --> 23:17.750
reading the Islamic State Times,
and, kaboom!

23:18.122 --> 23:21.414
All thanks to some geek
in Vegas with a joystick.

23:22.114 --> 23:23.959
Outsourcing's the modern way.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.465
Us violent psychopaths are
lucky to still have jobs.

23:40.725 --> 23:42.006
So, why did you leave?

23:42.470 --> 23:44.819
Got fed up with arresting squaddies
for a living.

23:45.165 --> 23:47.050
Also, red wasn't my colour.

23:47.665 --> 23:49.125
Green's so much better.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.599
Matches your eyes, boss.

23:51.407 --> 23:53.352
RMPs are guaranteed commission.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.388
Felt like the right call at the time.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.565
- What?
- Wanted to see a bit more of the world.

23:59.044 --> 24:02.177
I mean, look around you,
practically a gap year.

24:02.790 --> 24:04.830
Jamie!

24:06.045 --> 24:07.565
Contact rear!

24:10.079 --> 24:12.084
Ah!

24:12.440 --> 24:14.445
Jamie, it's OK, it's OK.

24:14.480 --> 24:15.965
The nurses will hear.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.845
Sh! Sh!

24:17.880 --> 24:19.485
Sh! Sh!

24:25.270 --> 24:26.851
Sorry, sorry.

24:27.458 --> 24:30.748
I-I was worried. I thought
that something was happening.

24:31.787 --> 24:33.045
Bad dream.

24:33.773 --> 24:36.338
You have to be careful. We all do.

24:36.374 --> 24:37.895
Especially at night.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.280
OK.

24:39.316 --> 24:41.961
I told you, people die in here.

24:42.108 --> 24:44.233
The numbers don't lie,
I have the evidence.

24:49.071 --> 24:52.111
If you don't want to take it
to the top, I'll do it myself.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.679
Those scissors were half an inch
into his thigh.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.890
You know what Matt's like,
he's just an idiot.

25:05.928 --> 25:08.033
Which is why someone
should have checked him!

25:09.617 --> 25:11.431
Maybe I should raise it with Archie.

25:12.053 --> 25:15.933
He'll only blame the nurses,
which means they'll blame you.

25:17.110 --> 25:18.515
Look, it happens.

25:19.074 --> 25:20.645
But twice in two days?

25:21.356 --> 25:23.325
This is supposed to be a leading unit.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.085
If nursing standards are slipping...

25:25.120 --> 25:27.445
Look, there was nothing strange
about Mr McGould.

25:27.962 --> 25:31.047
It's a hospital, people die.
There's no getting around that.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.443
It's like Archie says, it's a bad run.

25:36.108 --> 25:37.257
I love you.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.228
I love you, too.

25:41.616 --> 25:42.769
Oh, wait!

25:45.685 --> 25:48.183
- Et voilà.
- You found it.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.247
Just got Ali to fix you up a new one.

25:50.773 --> 25:53.094
Had to endure 15 minutes
of football chat.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.925
Apparently, they need a new manager.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.869
That's right. He's a muppet.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.762
Thanks. Now I really do love you.

26:14.020 --> 26:15.206
Jamie?

26:17.920 --> 26:20.040
Hi, there, sleepyhead.

26:21.365 --> 26:23.330
I just... can't believe this.

26:23.366 --> 26:26.086
It's literally unbelievable.

26:29.461 --> 26:30.944
You weren't answering my calls

26:30.980 --> 26:33.265
and at first, I thought,
you know, bastard!

26:34.000 --> 26:37.405
But then I thought, no,
we had such a connection.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.285
So I remembered the friend you were with

26:39.320 --> 26:41.285
and managed to get hold of him
on Facebook

26:41.320 --> 26:42.960
and he told me what had happened.

26:44.116 --> 26:45.916
So here I am.

26:48.630 --> 26:50.190
Mandy, right?

26:51.254 --> 26:52.643
I've got something for you.

26:58.199 --> 26:59.829
It's a healing crystal.

27:01.471 --> 27:03.357
Do you think I need a tetanus booster?

27:03.730 --> 27:05.362
Almost certainly not.

27:05.399 --> 27:08.844
What about antibiotics? They say
that human bites are the worst.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.005
Do you know how many different
pathogenic bacteria

27:11.041 --> 27:12.206
there is in the human mouth?

27:12.442 --> 27:13.487
No.

27:13.709 --> 27:16.354
496, and that's just an average.

27:17.130 --> 27:20.105
He shouldn't have bit you,
no matter what the provocation.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.005
He was scared.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.685
I expect I would be, if I was him.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.634
He's probably killed people.
The SAS are allowed to do that.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.623
Have you ever killed anyone?

27:29.642 --> 27:32.282
No. Not that I know of, anyway.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.045
OK, there.

27:35.330 --> 27:38.855
Augmentin. I should have Augmentin.
That's Co-amoxiclav.

27:38.891 --> 27:42.211
625mg, three times per day.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.810
- I'm sure you're right.
- I'm always right.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.318
It's all to do with
the concentration of energy.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.690
Healing energy.

27:53.237 --> 27:55.685
- I'm not the crystal type.
- Really?

27:55.720 --> 27:58.847
When we met, you told me you had a
deep interest in New Age philosophy.

28:00.340 --> 28:04.245
I want you to know that many people
would find all this just too hard,

28:04.280 --> 28:05.951
but I'm not one of those people.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.085
I'm in this for the long haul.

28:09.350 --> 28:13.395
Hi! I'm afraid that's
the end of visiting. Sorry.

28:13.828 --> 28:14.800
OK.

28:15.293 --> 28:18.898
I'm going to hang this right here,
where you can see it.

28:19.556 --> 28:21.333
And then you will know
that I am with you.

28:21.782 --> 28:24.342
The healing will... radiate.

28:31.260 --> 28:35.100
Now, I will be back tomorrow, I promise.

28:42.657 --> 28:44.424
Can you take that thing down?

28:45.170 --> 28:46.352
Sure.

28:46.741 --> 28:48.955
I hear they can be very potent.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.298
I'm assuming you have no more use
for its healing powers.

28:52.944 --> 28:55.525
Cos I've got a wee girl in
the Paeds bay who'd love that.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.179
Is she a nutcase, too?

28:57.760 --> 29:00.039
Totally. She's also nine.

29:00.833 --> 29:02.934
If she starts walking, I want it back.

29:06.214 --> 29:08.534
- So, was that your girlfriend?
- No.

29:09.362 --> 29:11.416
Yet she's bringing you crystals.

29:12.671 --> 29:14.152
A friend of a friend.

29:14.996 --> 29:16.973
Amanda. It was one night.

29:17.142 --> 29:18.907
Sometimes one night's all you need.

29:18.943 --> 29:21.191
Well, then, I know she's mental.
Who wants to screw a cripple?

29:21.227 --> 29:23.592
Language! Don't like the C word.

29:23.759 --> 29:25.191
No cripples in here.

29:25.413 --> 29:27.179
I don't think you're looking
hard enough.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.565
I need to examine you.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.125
Record your muscle power.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.065
I'd say it's currently
just north of fuck all!

29:33.101 --> 29:35.791
- Are you a doctor?
- I know a waste of time when I see one.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.605
Well, fortunately, just like
your girlfriend,

29:38.640 --> 29:39.805
I don't take no for an answer.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.365
She's not my girlfriend.

29:41.536 --> 29:44.821
So, how did Amanda fall helplessly
in love with you

29:44.857 --> 29:46.109
after just one night?

29:46.680 --> 29:48.640
Apart from your charm and good looks.

29:51.816 --> 29:53.101
I'm a good listener.

29:53.371 --> 29:55.416
Ha-ha! You're a man!

29:55.657 --> 29:58.091
Men are not good listeners,
they just think they are.

29:58.150 --> 30:00.795
Yeah? I hear everything
that goes on in here.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.590
Bed two, Asher.

30:03.633 --> 30:04.694
Push.

30:04.730 --> 30:07.085
She thinks her boyfriend's
scared to come and see her,

30:07.120 --> 30:09.059
but the truth is,
he's screwing her best friend

30:09.095 --> 30:10.960
and that's guilting her
into visiting every day.

30:11.137 --> 30:13.565
Bed three, Danny's a conspiracy nut

30:13.600 --> 30:15.925
- who thinks everyone's out to get him.
- Push.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.605
Bed five, dared to vote SNP last time,

30:18.640 --> 30:20.816
but he's switched back to the Tories.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.845
He's bullied her for the last 20 years

30:22.880 --> 30:25.396
and now she's finally got an
opportunity to get her own back.

30:25.576 --> 30:27.165
Loving every second.

30:27.653 --> 30:30.554
Even if it means she's got to take
the bins out herself.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.205
- And Matt?
- Matt's an idiot.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.915
How is he, anyway?

30:35.360 --> 30:36.925
Still under observation.

30:37.744 --> 30:38.743
Good.

30:39.299 --> 30:42.819
So, what about me?
Have you been spying on me, too?

30:44.807 --> 30:46.287
You're nice to Danny.

30:46.974 --> 30:48.649
Maybe you're nice to everyone.

30:50.590 --> 30:53.790
Feed them a bit of hope
and they'll sing for their supper.

30:55.568 --> 30:57.404
Is that what you think we do here?

30:58.030 --> 31:00.161
You're here so we can help you.

31:00.291 --> 31:03.776
I'm here because I'm broken.
Non-functional.

31:03.812 --> 31:05.209
I don't think you're broken.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.685
I know you're angry.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.174
- No shit!
- And I like that.

31:09.456 --> 31:12.256
In a place like this,
acceptance stays in bed...

31:13.080 --> 31:14.680
...anger walks out of here.

31:16.421 --> 31:17.890
I'm going to leave the crystal.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.978
You can take it down yourself,
when you want to.

31:26.811 --> 31:29.365
It might help if the chief
executive actually knew

31:29.400 --> 31:30.725
what this "meeting" was about.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.551
It's confidential. Staff feedback
forms, needs to be anonymous.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.365
Oh! So, you've been rating us, have you?

31:36.400 --> 31:38.991
That's what you've been doing
with your little tablet thing.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.569
Customer feedback improves performance,

31:41.605 --> 31:43.937
and I've got some important data
I need to share.

31:43.973 --> 31:46.654
Imagine, here was me thinking
you were just one of my patients.

31:47.611 --> 31:49.296
Well, yes, I will let her know.

31:49.448 --> 31:50.463
Her?

31:50.616 --> 31:54.658
Oh, yes. Didn't you know?
The chief executive is a woman.

31:59.362 --> 32:00.767
Hi! Dr Watson?

32:01.240 --> 32:04.621
I was wondering if you'd heard
anything yet about Mr McGould's PM?

32:04.657 --> 32:09.182
Er... I meant to ask, how's our new
admission, Jamie McCain?

32:09.537 --> 32:11.605
Any cracks in the facade?

32:11.640 --> 32:13.123
Not really.

32:13.182 --> 32:15.046
We spoke, sort of.

32:15.383 --> 32:16.815
Well, keep trying.

32:17.280 --> 32:21.205
I'm going to send Laila in there,
see if she can figure him out.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.043
Let's focus on the patients
who are still alive, shall we?

32:36.015 --> 32:37.100
Argh!

32:38.062 --> 32:39.528
Hello, Jamie.

32:41.339 --> 32:42.645
I'm Dr Karimi.

32:42.680 --> 32:45.637
Dr Watson asked me stop by,
thought we should have a chat.

32:47.656 --> 32:50.341
I thought maybe we could start
by talking about the accident.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.967
No small talk?

32:53.400 --> 32:54.532
If you like.

32:56.637 --> 32:57.859
Not really.

32:58.259 --> 32:59.679
Accident, then.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.918
You could call it that,

33:01.954 --> 33:03.570
or you could call it a fuckup.

33:04.105 --> 33:06.874
OK. So let's talk about the fuckup.

33:09.311 --> 33:10.984
You're a shrink, right?

33:11.222 --> 33:12.528
How can you tell?

33:14.579 --> 33:16.177
If that really is you.

33:17.934 --> 33:19.264
Laser surgery.

33:19.725 --> 33:22.334
And, yes, I'm a clinical psychiatrist.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.667
A lot of our patients have
mental health issues

33:24.703 --> 33:25.948
that need to be addressed.

33:25.984 --> 33:27.313
Just like that?

33:27.880 --> 33:31.360
I didn't say it was simple,
I said they need to be addressed.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.205
I preferred you with the glasses.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.160
Interesting.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.545
You are the first.

33:40.762 --> 33:42.145
Is this compulsory?

33:42.385 --> 33:43.606
What do you think?

33:45.319 --> 33:47.644
Do you have any contact
with the outside world?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.220
- They tell me you have a girlfriend.
- No.

33:54.880 --> 33:58.122
You were referred here because
this is your last home address.

33:58.614 --> 34:01.691
Most of my patients look forward
to visits from friends and family.

34:01.727 --> 34:03.172
Especially family.

34:03.685 --> 34:05.165
We don't communicate.

34:06.167 --> 34:09.280
And this... situation won't change that?

34:14.020 --> 34:15.040
Fine.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.065
I'll come back.

34:18.702 --> 34:20.409
Not as if you're going anywhere.

34:20.445 --> 34:21.661
Hm!

34:22.136 --> 34:23.420
Are you always this brutal?

34:23.542 --> 34:26.302
I tell the truth. Do you?

34:28.360 --> 34:30.120
Actually, I lied about the glasses.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.085
Isolate yourself in a place like this

34:34.121 --> 34:35.966
and your mind can start to play tricks.

34:36.201 --> 34:37.960
See things that aren't there.

34:39.288 --> 34:41.487
When you're ready, call me.

34:55.100 --> 34:58.545
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Come in, come in. Take a seat.

34:58.580 --> 35:01.905
Hm! I just wanted to check in, really.

35:01.940 --> 35:04.025
You and Zoe, it's going well, then?

35:04.160 --> 35:06.925
Sure. I mean, I like to think so.

35:07.060 --> 35:11.225
Absolutely. Women, eh!
A puzzle wrapped in an enigma.

35:11.683 --> 35:13.885
The old emotional Rubik's Cube.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.432
You solve one side
and then, the others...

35:16.480 --> 35:19.200
- Ah! You know, totally screwed.
- Right.

35:21.995 --> 35:26.228
Ah! This job's become
a lot more complicated, Alex.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.405
Used to be you just made people better

35:28.440 --> 35:30.305
and then you could go
and work on your handicap.

35:30.341 --> 35:33.506
Now, apparently, I have a duty of care.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.645
Zoe's fine. Great, actually.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.197
Good. Good.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.698
You understand I had to ask?

35:41.040 --> 35:42.325
If there were any issues,

35:42.360 --> 35:44.685
any recurrence of what happened
last year...

35:44.720 --> 35:47.447
She's never been better. Really.

35:48.252 --> 35:49.929
Well, I'm delighted to hear it.

35:50.760 --> 35:54.647
To lose six months at this stage
of your career...

35:54.896 --> 35:56.576
She will need your support.

35:59.005 --> 36:01.302
Well, that was it. Just, er...
I'm just checking in.

36:02.528 --> 36:03.542
Right.

36:08.264 --> 36:11.508
She did ask me about McGould's
postmortem this morning.

36:11.799 --> 36:15.444
I don't think it's a good idea
to ruminate on bad outcomes.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.193
Could give the unit a bad name.

36:17.528 --> 36:20.053
Yeah, we want to stay positive, hm?

36:20.528 --> 36:21.882
Absolutely.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.015
Good. Well... good to talk.

36:58.764 --> 37:00.768
Bobby's really going
to be your best man?

37:01.105 --> 37:02.821
You know we were in primary together.

37:03.256 --> 37:04.861
He's like a human prison tattoo.

37:05.392 --> 37:08.216
You might regret it,
but you can't get rid of it.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.185
Look, Bobby's OK.

37:10.221 --> 37:13.488
He loves you. Thinks you have attitude

37:14.480 --> 37:16.680
- and a nice arse.
- Ooh! I'm touched!

37:18.320 --> 37:19.885
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:19.920 --> 37:23.005
Loo. Oh, and I don't want to sit
next to Bobby any more.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.318
He can puke on you.

37:25.113 --> 37:26.545
Bobby doesn't puke.

37:26.861 --> 37:28.621
It's his acknowledged superpower.

37:29.624 --> 37:30.978
What can I get you?

38:41.960 --> 38:44.485
Zero, this is Bravo 30, contact way out!

38:44.620 --> 38:47.145
Man down! Swap place!

38:49.700 --> 38:51.367
OK, on me!

38:52.948 --> 38:53.936
Move!

39:21.880 --> 39:23.812
Down the alley, to the left.

39:37.842 --> 39:41.042
I'm sorry, skip, missed visiting time.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.805
How'd you get in here?

39:45.490 --> 39:46.931
Got the skills, boss.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.595
You think a professional soldier
can't get past

39:50.631 --> 39:53.436
a couple of dodgy jock security guards?

39:53.472 --> 39:56.141
Huh! True.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.630
So, how are you doing?

40:00.160 --> 40:01.800
You OK?

40:03.040 --> 40:04.320
Honestly?

40:04.996 --> 40:06.276
Not so good.

40:24.920 --> 40:26.525
Hey, come on, love, you're all right.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.040
It's just a dream, Jamie.

41:33.412 --> 41:35.930
Jamie's night terrors
are becoming an issue.

41:35.966 --> 41:38.731
Post-traumatic stress is more
than likely the reason,

41:38.767 --> 41:39.772
given his history.

41:39.808 --> 41:42.173
Whatever the cause is,
we do need to do something.

41:42.209 --> 41:44.090
Sleep is a key part of recovery.

41:44.126 --> 41:46.575
Then we either move him,
or sedate him more heavily.

41:46.611 --> 41:49.497
Sedation is never ideal,
but we may have no choice.

41:51.470 --> 41:52.814
Double his dose.

42:06.541 --> 42:09.426
I hope you won't be offended
if I ask to see some ID.

42:09.462 --> 42:11.307
I'd be disappointed if you didn't.

42:11.852 --> 42:14.165
It's a brief initial interview,
that's all.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.565
Just to get the ball rolling.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.728
I see.

42:17.094 --> 42:19.648
Would it be totally inappropriate
to ask what happened out there?

42:19.684 --> 42:21.929
Jamie hasn't exactly been forthcoming.

42:22.216 --> 42:24.061
I'm afraid that's not
possible at this stage.

42:24.097 --> 42:26.105
Not with the fatal incident
investigation still ongoing.

42:26.141 --> 42:27.061
Hm.

42:27.468 --> 42:29.733
Obviously, all information received
would be totally confidential.

42:30.030 --> 42:32.624
As I said, not possible at this stage.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.760
Now, can I see Corporal McCain?

42:42.959 --> 42:44.564
You should know that anything you say

42:44.600 --> 42:46.443
will form part of
the official investigation.

42:47.314 --> 42:48.513
Sure.

42:48.916 --> 42:51.681
You can even handcuff me, if you
like, make sure I don't run away.

42:51.717 --> 42:53.237
No-one is under arrest.

42:53.273 --> 42:55.294
We simply want to establish the facts.

42:55.825 --> 42:59.045
Four soldiers lost their lives
that day. Only two came home.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.331
You were their leader.

43:00.592 --> 43:02.837
It's important you
engage in this process

43:02.873 --> 43:04.142
so we can establish exactly why.

43:04.483 --> 43:06.568
Poor planning, bullshit mission.

43:06.947 --> 43:08.509
They were all waiting for us.

43:08.733 --> 43:10.373
That's all you need to know.

43:11.774 --> 43:13.563
You were a red cap
before you transferred.

43:14.593 --> 43:15.706
Yeah.

43:15.742 --> 43:17.707
So you'll understand
that I'm just doing my job.

43:17.743 --> 43:19.359
No-one is apportioning blame.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.280
Not yet. That bit comes later.

43:23.022 --> 43:24.564
Well, the truth can't hurt you,

43:25.642 --> 43:27.467
unless you really have
something to hide.

43:33.577 --> 43:37.262
We walked into a bad situation
and had to fight our way out.

43:37.716 --> 43:39.725
As you can see, the results were mixed.

43:40.390 --> 43:43.395
The intelligence suggested the area
had already been secured.

43:43.431 --> 43:45.572
Well, in that case,
I should still be able to walk.

43:48.150 --> 43:51.445
I'm sorry you were injured, but
you were a lot more fortunate

43:51.480 --> 43:53.414
than the other soldiers
under your command.

43:53.780 --> 43:55.109
You mean they're dead.

43:55.830 --> 43:59.290
And right now,
that's exactly where I'd rather be.

44:26.522 --> 44:27.690
Hey, Jamie.

44:28.440 --> 44:31.280
This is my last day.
Day 47, to be exact.

44:32.444 --> 44:33.807
Congratulations.

44:35.062 --> 44:36.418
I want you to have this.

44:36.848 --> 44:39.013
It's all there.
I can give you the passcode.

44:39.049 --> 44:41.534
No. It's yours. I don't want it.

44:41.570 --> 44:44.055
You're my friend, you'll need it.
Please.

44:44.091 --> 44:45.212
Danny...

44:45.450 --> 44:48.110
I want you to have this.
You will need the data.

44:48.553 --> 44:50.353
It's OK, I'm getting an upgrade.

44:52.993 --> 44:55.337
I've already reported it
to my superiors.

44:56.248 --> 44:58.500
They're investigating
the case as we speak.

44:59.325 --> 45:01.362
I had a visit from the military police.

45:01.853 --> 45:03.236
I told them everything.

45:03.570 --> 45:07.135
They'll contact you, but not here.
It's too public.

45:07.573 --> 45:09.405
Sure, sure. OK.

45:09.744 --> 45:12.125
Go home, prepare your files

45:12.520 --> 45:14.240
and wait for further instruction.

45:15.408 --> 45:18.020
And don't mention this
to anyone else. Understood?

45:18.625 --> 45:19.709
Got it.

45:21.079 --> 45:23.790
You'll be OK, once I'm gone?

45:24.836 --> 45:25.921
Eyes on.

45:26.790 --> 45:28.755
They've given me pills to keep me awake.

45:28.791 --> 45:30.316
It's all sorted, yeah?

45:31.666 --> 45:35.479
You've done a great job,
but you're relieved now.

45:36.005 --> 45:38.130
Go home, take it easy,

45:38.360 --> 45:40.743
carry on with your life
as if nothing's happened.

45:41.905 --> 45:43.585
Direct order from the top.

45:44.664 --> 45:46.629
OK. Got it. Huh!

45:47.040 --> 45:48.410
Good luck, Jamie.

46:01.756 --> 46:04.444
- Debbie? - Hm?
- I won't need that meeting now,

46:04.480 --> 46:05.980
with the chief executive.

46:06.016 --> 46:07.831
- Oh.
- Could you cancel it for me?

46:08.440 --> 46:10.765
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Thanks.

46:10.800 --> 46:11.819
No problem.

46:29.619 --> 46:31.459
This'll help you sleep.

47:04.160 --> 47:07.485
Oh, look, I'm sorry, I just... I have
to get this appraisal thing done.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.342
If you could just put
something in the Aga?

47:12.330 --> 47:13.949
Hm? OK. OK.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.100
Does she ever leave you alone?

47:23.605 --> 47:25.061
The joys of married life.

48:01.626 --> 48:03.106
Danny, enough.

48:03.927 --> 48:05.007
Now.

48:06.217 --> 48:07.333
Thank you.

49:05.400 --> 49:07.200
Adrenaline! Any response?

49:12.720 --> 49:14.685
Charging 300.

49:14.720 --> 49:15.960
Clear!

49:16.608 --> 49:18.008
Still nothing!

49:18.993 --> 49:20.713
Again!

49:21.951 --> 49:23.271
Restart CPR!

49:38.080 --> 49:39.200
Danny?

49:53.348 --> 49:54.513
Hey!

49:54.806 --> 49:55.920
Kelly!

49:56.855 --> 49:58.295
Kelly, what happened?

49:58.811 --> 50:01.331
OK, let's just get him out.
I'll get his stuff in a minute.

50:15.716 --> 50:17.796
Data never lies.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.072
"People die."

54:26.108 --> 54:27.713
Those were his exact words.

54:27.749 --> 54:29.157
Now he's the one who's dead.

54:29.193 --> 54:30.838
He was a nice kid, not a case study.

54:30.874 --> 54:32.359
You're Danny's mother, right?

54:32.767 --> 54:36.092
We're still missing a tablet that
he had. I'm sure it'll turn up.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.969
We just want to know
why he died, Doctor.

54:39.162 --> 54:40.367
He told me something.

54:40.403 --> 54:42.488
I'd appreciate it if you
kept this to yourself.

54:42.542 --> 54:44.027
What about him?!

54:44.063 --> 54:46.249
Now, all you have to do is push.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.325
Corporal McCain, there are discrepancies

54:48.360 --> 54:49.685
with your initial statement.

54:49.720 --> 54:50.725
I'm going to recommend

54:50.760 --> 54:52.736
that this investigation
continues with a court martial.

54:53.160 --> 54:55.885
There's a killer on the ward, and
Danny had the numbers to prove it.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.499
Either that, or we're both nuts.

54:57.535 --> 54:59.620
- He's right, this is evidence.
- Shit!
