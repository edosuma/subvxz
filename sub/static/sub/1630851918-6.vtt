WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:16.950
- [Anna-Belle] And he couldn't see you?

00:17.784 --> 00:19.185
- Not even once?

00:20.353 --> 00:23.623
I observed no deviations

00:24.824 --> 00:27.527
All symptoms are fully and

00:28.795 --> 00:30.430
Loss of libido,

00:30.530 --> 00:31.798
loss of appetite,

00:32.399 --> 00:33.800
social distancing,

00:34.601 --> 00:36.469
feelings of worthlessness,

00:37.437 --> 00:40.473
neglect of personal hygiene,

00:40.573 --> 00:42.409
insomnia, weight loss.

00:43.009 --> 00:45.278
Everything is exactly according

00:45.345 --> 00:46.880
just as it should be.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.649
Sometimes a bit more surprising,

00:50.784 --> 00:51.885
but that fits the case.

00:56.356 --> 00:57.991
But that makes no sense.

00:58.091 --> 01:01.094
All symptoms of a moderate depression

01:01.694 --> 01:04.230
Nevertheless, there are

01:04.330 --> 01:05.465
of a severe depression,

01:05.565 --> 01:07.367
which, in my opinion,

01:07.434 --> 01:12.005
by the unauthorized appearance

01:12.072 --> 01:13.373
in the life of the case.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.010
However, I saw no sign

01:17.077 --> 01:21.347
on the part of F32.1-2011/01.

01:23.149 --> 01:26.486
All right, I've heard enough.

01:26.553 --> 01:32.926
F32.2-2009/02 will face

01:32.992 --> 01:34.227
and should be transferred.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.530
You granted him unwarranted access

01:37.597 --> 01:40.200
so, of course, you too will face

01:40.800 --> 01:43.470
In this case, I would plead

01:43.570 --> 01:46.473
Although she acted directly

01:46.573 --> 01:50.910
It was her first discrepancy and

01:51.010 --> 01:53.613
I think she acted

01:53.680 --> 01:55.782
for the case, for our department.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.252
- Good.

01:59.319 --> 02:00.720
I remembered something else.

02:01.387 --> 02:03.089
Yes, we're listening.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.192
The case keeps repeating

02:06.292 --> 02:08.695
I couldn't find anything about it

02:08.761 --> 02:10.797
or in the Archive of Feelings.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.567
- Just in case it's somehow important.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.669
Monika.

02:18.371 --> 02:19.272
No one I know.

02:20.607 --> 02:21.508
And you?

02:22.642 --> 02:23.810
Monika?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.078
No.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.112
Never heard of it.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.722
[doorbell rings]

02:37.624 --> 02:39.159
[Elle sobbing]

02:39.225 --> 02:40.360
[doorbell rings again]

02:48.635 --> 02:49.702
[Elle] Mat!

02:49.802 --> 02:51.304
[sobbing]

02:51.404 --> 02:52.872
Can you please open the door?

02:56.075 --> 02:59.212
I'm really worried and I think

03:02.882 --> 03:05.451
Please, I just want to know

03:10.757 --> 03:12.692
[beeps, door buzzes]

03:15.228 --> 03:16.162
[door opens]

03:20.133 --> 03:21.401
[he sighs]

03:36.583 --> 03:37.517
Nice house.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.255
Does he live here all alone?

03:43.623 --> 03:44.958
Yeah.

03:45.024 --> 03:45.959
[she sighs]

03:52.031 --> 03:53.266
Where is Monika?

03:56.169 --> 03:57.070
I don't know.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.040
Suddenly, she was gone.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.743
You know, I haven't seen her

04:04.811 --> 04:05.712
days.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.449
Or weeks, I guess.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.651
Then you've defeated her.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.886
Do your mothers know

04:14.454 --> 04:16.723
[she inhales sharply]

04:17.790 --> 04:18.725
[he sighs]

04:22.795 --> 04:24.163
[doorbell rings]

04:24.230 --> 04:25.632
[Nabil] Uh, hi.

04:25.732 --> 04:28.067
- I'll let you in. Come on.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.205
[Pippa panting]

04:34.274 --> 04:36.743
This is all your fault,

04:36.843 --> 04:39.312
Because you're such a...

04:40.613 --> 04:42.081
Thank you for calling us, Mat.

04:42.148 --> 04:44.384
Elle is a child, Mat.

04:44.484 --> 04:47.186
She shouldn't have to feel

04:47.287 --> 04:49.088
who behaves as irresponsibly

04:49.155 --> 04:50.723
- But he's not well.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.294
- He's not doing it on purpose.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.162
I've known him for ages,

04:56.229 --> 04:58.064
- What Nabil is trying...

04:58.631 --> 04:59.565
You hate him.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.568
You've been complaining for weeks

05:03.236 --> 05:05.838
- But the fact that he called shows...

05:10.843 --> 05:12.445
I can't go on like this anymore.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.281
[Pippa starts sobbing]

05:24.324 --> 05:25.892
[Mat breathes deeply]

05:26.793 --> 05:28.828
So, it... it started when...

05:29.829 --> 05:31.931
I'd just moved in with my, uh...

05:33.199 --> 05:34.133
with Susa.

05:35.868 --> 05:36.969
My ex-girlfriend.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.242
I think I was afraid,

05:44.711 --> 05:46.612
because I couldn't write songs

05:49.549 --> 05:51.718
I was afraid she might think

05:52.552 --> 05:54.153
[sighs] I don't know.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.194
Then Monika appeared.

06:04.964 --> 06:06.766
One night, she was just there

06:06.833 --> 06:08.968
and she began telling me

06:10.970 --> 06:11.871
worthless.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.810
And that Susa will see that...

06:21.314 --> 06:23.950
And Monika is this voice

06:27.487 --> 06:28.388
Yeah.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.564
But I can see her too.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.268
[sighs softly]

06:43.236 --> 06:44.971
That's probably not normal, huh?

06:47.707 --> 06:50.543
I'm not really a fan

06:51.811 --> 06:53.679
But some triggers are

06:54.414 --> 06:55.548
Like catalysts.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.717
They strengthen the voices

06:57.784 --> 07:00.153
that tell us that we are

07:00.920 --> 07:02.655
And we can't sleep.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.290
They're quite real.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.959
And it can very well happen

07:07.026 --> 07:09.562
that we cannot fight those voices

07:09.629 --> 07:11.764
because they just never seem

07:14.133 --> 07:16.436
I feel like I can't hear the world

07:18.971 --> 07:19.872
Like it's...

07:22.074 --> 07:23.376
wrapped in cotton.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.318
And recently, there is

07:35.154 --> 07:36.956
different, something

07:39.158 --> 07:40.092
[sighs]

07:42.328 --> 07:43.396
Because sometimes...

07:46.466 --> 07:48.334
there's so much darkness

07:54.707 --> 07:57.543
I understand very well

07:58.544 --> 08:00.613
- Yeah.

08:03.549 --> 08:07.453
But that is such a grave thought

08:09.322 --> 08:12.091
you should get a different kind

08:12.158 --> 08:13.693
than the one I can give you here.

08:15.561 --> 08:16.496
[he sighs]

08:20.366 --> 08:21.267
But...

08:22.468 --> 08:25.571
I know a place where you can get

08:28.374 --> 08:32.411
[Monika] Next case: DE08092001DEB.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.288
Have a good one.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.543
The question of how you returned

09:03.643 --> 09:05.811
has not yet been answered

09:06.646 --> 09:09.849
No one may find out that you were

09:09.916 --> 09:12.685
therefore, this conversation

09:14.287 --> 09:16.522
Hence, herewith you are sworn

09:16.589 --> 09:18.124
to absolute secrecy.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.728
Infringement will result in

Yeah!

10:37.203 --> 10:38.104

10:39.171 --> 10:40.906
I felt like I wanted

10:41.007 --> 10:42.074
[Mat laughs]

10:49.949 --> 10:51.984
That can only mean I'm healthy

10:53.252 --> 10:54.754
What makes you think that?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.390
Well, I'm hungry again.

10:58.124 --> 11:01.560
Uh, I have more energy, I feel

11:02.194 --> 11:03.396
I want to have sex again.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.364
I'm happy for you.

11:07.466 --> 11:10.336
- And what's the significance...

11:11.370 --> 11:14.040
Sex is not a solution

11:14.106 --> 11:15.675
and it is dangerous

11:16.542 --> 11:18.144
- Is that actually so?

11:18.944 --> 11:21.247
I mean, I really love sex, but...

11:22.915 --> 11:25.151
I don't need it anymore

11:28.487 --> 11:30.089
There are no more voices
