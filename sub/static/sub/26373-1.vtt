I've always been good
to you, library!

25:19.517 --> 25:20.560
This is it!

25:20.602 --> 25:23.439
The last piece was in
a secret compartment!

25:23.481 --> 25:26.566
Clover the Clever
buried the stone!

25:26.608 --> 25:30.196
This rock formation must be
somewhere in the other world.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.656
But it doesn't say how to
get your memories back.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.245
"Perhaps if I had destroyed
the stone right away,

25:38.287 --> 25:40.831
some of my memories
could have returned.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.833
But when the sun sets
by the third day

25:42.875 --> 25:45.127
after a memory
has been taken...

25:45.169 --> 25:47.754
it is erased forever."

25:47.796 --> 25:50.548
You must warn Sunset
Shimmer at once.

25:52.218 --> 25:55.304
So. Where should
we start, partner?

25:55.346 --> 25:57.473
How about with
what I call you?

25:57.515 --> 26:01.559
"The Great and
Powerful Trixie's...

26:01.601 --> 26:04.562
pretty-decent-assistant-
detective-helper-person."

26:17.951 --> 26:21.038
A cafeteria full of
suspects, two detectives,

26:21.080 --> 26:23.623
and only one memory stone.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.919
Seems impossible, but so does
pulling a rabbit out of a hat

26:26.960 --> 26:29.463
and I do that all the time.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.673
Let's talk motive.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.133
Who here hates you enough

26:33.175 --> 26:35.635
to erase everyone's
good memories of you?

26:35.677 --> 26:36.887
If you go back
far enough?

26:38.931 --> 26:39.932
Everyone.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.394
Known enemies... all.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.108
Good afternoon, ladies.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.650
You feeling okay?

26:50.692 --> 26:54.154
That depends on how well
you answer my questions.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.990
Has anyone come in complaining
of memory problems

26:57.032 --> 26:58.658
in the last few weeks?

26:58.700 --> 27:00.578
Not that I
can recall.

27:00.618 --> 27:02.955
You can't recall?

27:02.996 --> 27:04.831
We're too late.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.875
Is there anything you
can tell us about it?

27:06.917 --> 27:08.335
Anything at all?

27:08.377 --> 27:09.836
I can't tell much
from a drawing.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.340
Okay.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.675
Only that it's felsic
intrusive igneous,

27:15.717 --> 27:17.719
granular in texture,
most likely arranged

27:17.761 --> 27:20.680
in an equigranular matrix with
scattered biotite mica

27:20.722 --> 27:24.684
and amphibole, at least 65 %
alkali feldspar by volume,

27:24.726 --> 27:27.187
with a melting point
of twelve-fifty centigrade

27:27.229 --> 27:28.772
plus or minus ten degrees.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.566
Sorry I couldn't
be more helpful.

27:31.858 --> 27:36.071
Sure, it seems like we've only
come up with dead ends.

27:36.113 --> 27:39.950
But I mean, it could be worse.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.702
It's worse.

27:42.744 --> 27:43.954

28:08.145 --> 28:09.729
you're just going to
wind yourself up.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.773
You can't think if
you're wound up.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.733
Oh! Think, Trixie!

28:13.775 --> 28:16.487
I wanted to come in here to
see who we're missing.

28:16.529 --> 28:19.657
But we've talked to
everyone, A to Z.

28:19.697 --> 28:24.077

28:28.165 --> 28:30.417
Uh, who are you?

28:30.459 --> 28:34.921
Wallflower. I've known
you since third grade.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.133
Ah, I remember third grade.

28:38.175 --> 28:41.761
Not you specifically,

28:41.803 --> 28:43.889

Sunset,
we think the Memory Stone

28:54.400 --> 28:56.109
was buried under
this rock formation.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.819
And if you don't destroy
the memory stone

28:57.861 --> 28:59.779
by the time the
sun sets today,

28:59.821 --> 29:02.782
all those memories
will be erased forever!

29:02.824 --> 29:05.244
How am I supposed to
find a rock formation

29:05.285 --> 29:09.748
