00:39.955 --> 00:42.891
- Hi-yah!
- Sikhya!

Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:53.769 --> 00:56.739
(man): Any changes in vision
or hearing?

01:00.775 --> 01:02.575
No.

01:02.577 --> 01:06.279
What about the headaches?
Are the meds helping at all?

01:06.281 --> 01:09.950
Look... the reason I came in
here is 'cause I remember

01:09.952 --> 01:13.320
you saying before
that altitude was a bad idea.

01:13.322 --> 01:16.957
It is. At high altitudes,

01:16.959 --> 01:19.626
your symptoms will get worse.

01:19.628 --> 01:22.462
Headaches, seizures,

01:22.464 --> 01:24.798
loss of consciousness even.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.433
Yeah.

01:26.435 --> 01:28.802
If there's severe swelling
around the tumour,

01:28.804 --> 01:30.938
it could be fatal.

01:30.940 --> 01:32.641
Yeah.

01:36.644 --> 01:38.478
Don't go, Jamie.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.814
I have to go.

01:40.816 --> 01:42.819

(background chatter)
(laughter)

02:36.037 --> 02:38.872
Excuse me.
Hi. Sorry, guys.

02:38.874 --> 02:40.773
I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

02:40.775 --> 02:43.576
Just wondered if you've seen her face?
Her name's Sophie.

02:43.578 --> 02:46.045
- No. Sorry, mate.
- Sorry. I hope you find her.

02:46.047 --> 02:47.649
Thanks.

02:54.922 --> 02:58.759
So we have no choice
but to follow the true way.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.760
We fail to follow this way...

03:00.762 --> 03:04.031
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt, guys.

03:04.033 --> 03:06.699
I'm looking for a friend.
She went missing a while back.

03:06.701 --> 03:08.034
She may have passed
through here.

03:08.036 --> 03:09.936
I just wanna know
if anybody's seen her.

03:09.938 --> 03:11.604
No, I haven't seen her.

03:11.606 --> 03:13.610
(bells jingling)

03:18.513 --> 03:21.050
(shouting in distance)

03:27.155 --> 03:29.423
This is the place.

03:29.425 --> 03:31.027
But I don't recognize her.

03:34.463 --> 03:36.962
Do you know this café?
You do?

03:36.964 --> 03:38.799
- Yes.
- Can you take me?

03:38.801 --> 03:40.803
Yes. Ah...

03:42.970 --> 03:44.574
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:50.178 --> 03:51.878
<i>It's okay?</i>

03:51.880 --> 03:53.816
Alright. Okay.

03:58.487 --> 04:00.823
Uh, sir, the café.

04:08.096 --> 04:09.998
(singing)

04:18.607 --> 04:20.510
(singing)

04:24.713 --> 04:27.516
(bells jingling)
(singing continues)

04:52.708 --> 04:54.544
(mystical singing)

05:11.960 --> 05:13.896
(singing continues)

05:23.605 --> 05:26.673
<i>This place is so beautiful,
Jamie.</i>

05:26.675 --> 05:28.742
And for the first time...
(sniffling)

05:28.744 --> 05:32.745
<i>...I'm really getting
to know who I am.</i>

05:32.747 --> 05:34.983
(background chatter)

05:55.603 --> 05:56.938
(honking)

06:08.617 --> 06:11.283
(soft music)

06:11.285 --> 06:12.954
(honking)

06:46.954 --> 06:49.157
- (knocking)
- Who is it?

06:49.658 --> 06:52.761
(door creaking)
(woman panting)

06:54.095 --> 06:55.665
(moaning)

06:59.001 --> 07:00.867
Can I help you, man?

07:00.869 --> 07:03.937
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean
to barge in like this.

07:03.939 --> 07:05.639
I just wanna ask you
a couple questions.

07:05.641 --> 07:06.872
- What's up, man?
- Take it easy.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.742
I... I saw your tattoo.

07:08.744 --> 07:10.877
- I just wanna know where you got 'em.
- Who is it, Jesse?

07:10.879 --> 07:13.713
- You have to get out here right now!
- Calm down.

07:13.715 --> 07:15.648
A friend of mine
had the same tattoo.

07:15.650 --> 07:17.249
- Now she's missing.
- This is your problem.

07:17.251 --> 07:20.021
Jesse, stop it.
(panting and moaning)

07:21.122 --> 07:22.788
Breathe, breathe.

07:22.790 --> 07:26.192
She had a tattoo.
She's... she's one of them.

07:26.194 --> 07:28.228
One of who?

07:28.230 --> 07:30.362
(whispering)

07:30.364 --> 07:32.201
Her name's Sophie.

07:34.001 --> 07:37.172
- Do you know her?
- Yeah. You're Jamie.

07:37.905 --> 07:41.774
How do you know my name?
Why do you know my name?

07:41.776 --> 07:43.043
(indistinct)
You know Sophie.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.877
You know Sophie.
(speaking Portuguese)

07:44.879 --> 07:47.747
Do you know Sophie?!
(speaking Portuguese)

07:47.749 --> 07:50.783
What happened to her?
(gasping)

07:50.785 --> 07:54.122
Her heart.
They did something to her heart.

07:56.725 --> 07:58.692
Here. Take this!

07:58.694 --> 08:01.194
Be careful out there.

08:01.196 --> 08:02.963
Where do I go?

08:02.965 --> 08:04.697
They won't let her go
so easily.

08:04.699 --> 08:06.899
Where? Where?
Tell me where. Where do I go?

08:06.901 --> 08:08.334
Don't tell them anything
about you.

08:08.336 --> 08:10.136
Who do I go?
(indistinct response)

08:10.138 --> 08:13.372
- Hang on a sec.
- Get out!

08:13.374 --> 08:15.374
- Tell me where to go.
- Get out! Get out!

08:15.376 --> 08:16.875
- No...
- Okay, okay.

08:16.877 --> 08:18.745
You've gotta get her
to a hospital.

08:18.747 --> 08:20.215
Breathe. Come on.

08:24.419 --> 08:26.255
(honking)

08:27.756 --> 08:29.759
(bell jangling)

08:31.792 --> 08:34.027
- (group singing)
- I need to go north.

08:34.029 --> 08:36.265
- North?
- As far north as I can.

08:55.016 --> 08:57.118
(mystical music)

09:04.892 --> 09:09.798
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop. Pull in, pull in.

09:12.434 --> 09:16.436
Why you want to talk
to this man, sir?

09:16.438 --> 09:20.139
I can take you, sir.
Don't worry. Namaste.

09:20.141 --> 09:21.441
(Hindi)

09:21.443 --> 09:24.376
Ask him
has he seen this before.

09:24.378 --> 09:25.880
(Hindi)

09:28.516 --> 09:30.251
(Hindi)

09:35.323 --> 09:37.326
(Hindi)

09:40.529 --> 09:43.062
- What's he saying?
- Sacred crossing.

09:43.064 --> 09:45.465
Sacred crossing.
What's that mean?

09:45.467 --> 09:47.236
(Hindi)

09:48.837 --> 09:52.172
Uh, where two rivers
meet together.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.541
Okay. Where? Where?

09:54.543 --> 09:57.246
(Hindi)

10:01.183 --> 10:02.514
That place.

10:02.516 --> 10:05.350
Upside. We can go together.

10:05.352 --> 10:08.087
What do you mean,
that place upside? Where?

10:08.089 --> 10:09.489
From that road.

10:09.491 --> 10:12.859
Upside from this up
and that place.

10:12.861 --> 10:14.362
Give him the...
(Hindi)

10:15.530 --> 10:17.533
(sighing)

10:20.501 --> 10:23.036
Thank you very much.

10:23.038 --> 10:25.304
Thank you. Thank you.

10:25.306 --> 10:26.975
(Hindi)

10:28.510 --> 10:30.780
Actually, I think he's crazy.

10:39.453 --> 10:41.390
(mystical music)

10:57.539 --> 10:59.341
How long, man?

11:00.541 --> 11:04.277
- Sir...
- Huh? Can you fix it?

11:04.279 --> 11:06.245
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

11:06.247 --> 11:08.548
- Big problem.
- What's wrong with it?

11:08.550 --> 11:11.183
Sir, you give me money.

11:11.185 --> 11:13.919
I give you... Why?

11:13.921 --> 11:15.522
So that I can fix it.

11:15.524 --> 11:17.426
You give me money.

11:21.195 --> 11:23.428
Here you go, okay?

11:23.430 --> 11:25.230
Not enough, sir.

11:25.232 --> 11:29.402
I don't have that much money
to give you. Okay?

11:29.404 --> 11:32.341
Understand, sir.
Big problem, big money, sir.

11:36.044 --> 11:38.278
Hey. Please...

11:38.280 --> 11:40.216
- Fix the bike.
- Okay, okay.

11:46.954 --> 11:48.456
Hey!!

12:03.604 --> 12:05.473
(birdsong)

12:21.455 --> 12:23.491
(bird call)

12:48.382 --> 12:50.585
(Sophie): <i>It's so crazy.</i>

12:52.520 --> 12:54.356
(Jamie): <i>What is?</i>

12:55.357 --> 12:57.322
I've seen this flower before.

12:57.324 --> 12:58.660
I know I have.

13:00.194 --> 13:02.327
Another sign?

13:02.329 --> 13:05.465
I mean this same flower.

13:05.467 --> 13:07.667
The same... cliff.

13:07.669 --> 13:09.534
The same moment.

13:09.536 --> 13:13.172
There's signs all around us
that have deeper meaning.

13:13.174 --> 13:15.642
If we choose to see them.

13:15.644 --> 13:17.980
Just like the number 23...

13:21.683 --> 13:23.419
<i>What does it mean?</i>

13:24.685 --> 13:27.552
<i>That we're
on the right track.</i>

13:27.554 --> 13:30.690
Everything we've ever done
in our entire lives

13:30.692 --> 13:34.494
has led us to this exact
moment right now.

13:34.496 --> 13:36.095
Here,

13:36.097 --> 13:38.067
on this cliff together.

13:39.034 --> 13:41.069
It's a miracle.

13:45.173 --> 13:47.309
I love you.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.246
You know that, right?

13:53.415 --> 13:55.583
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

13:58.520 --> 14:00.655
<i>And I always will.</i>

15:09.424 --> 15:10.793
Ah!

15:20.501 --> 15:22.338
(bird call)

15:46.227 --> 15:47.829
(birdsong)

15:53.535 --> 15:55.203
(panting)

16:05.814 --> 16:07.712
You must be lost.

16:07.714 --> 16:10.386
Trail is back that way.

16:13.387 --> 16:16.721
I'm told all those who seek
are welcome.

16:16.723 --> 16:18.791
And what is it you seek?

16:18.793 --> 16:20.393
The truth.

16:20.395 --> 16:23.232
The truth takes time,
my friend.

16:24.466 --> 16:26.769
Hey, whoa, whoa. Hey! Wait!

16:28.402 --> 16:31.671
You've no idea what I've been
through to get here.

16:31.673 --> 16:33.242
Please!

16:44.585 --> 16:46.421
(owl hooting)

17:03.271 --> 17:06.404
Hey. Hey. You gonna let me in?

17:06.406 --> 17:09.444
It's freezing out here.
I have no food or water.

17:11.479 --> 17:13.615
Hey, please! No! Wait.

18:17.345 --> 18:18.780
Do you wear these all the time?

18:34.828 --> 18:38.096
As you bring your awareness
back to your breath,

18:38.098 --> 18:42.401
I leave you
with this thought today.

18:42.403 --> 18:45.837
Present, past, future,
thou art I.

18:45.839 --> 18:48.342
I am thou, as one.

18:51.878 --> 18:53.381
Wait here.

19:06.394 --> 19:09.598
You certainly don't take no
for an answer.

19:10.565 --> 19:13.399
- I'm Jamie.
- I'm Chandra.

19:13.401 --> 19:15.704
Nice to meet you.

19:16.838 --> 19:19.939
I'm sorry about the wait,
but we do have to separate

19:19.941 --> 19:22.407
the casual seekers from the
serious, you understand.

19:22.409 --> 19:26.144
- I do. Truth takes time.
- Hmm.

19:26.146 --> 19:29.749
You're a quick learner.
Come, I'll show you around.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.549
Please.

19:31.551 --> 19:35.755
All the work you see here,
they're all forms of meditation.

19:35.757 --> 19:39.924
Connect with them and you connect
with your higher purpose.

19:39.926 --> 19:46.598
We are striving to remain
in balance with our surroundings

19:46.600 --> 19:48.534
in everything we do.

19:48.536 --> 19:50.135
Nitin?

19:50.137 --> 19:51.971
Morning.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.538
This is Jamie.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.807
It's a pleasure to meet you,
brother.

19:55.809 --> 19:57.576
You, too.

19:57.578 --> 20:00.011
- Where you from?
- California.

20:00.013 --> 20:02.147
- I like this guy already.
- You?

20:02.149 --> 20:05.651
Cleveland, but you know, we all start
and end in the same place, right?

20:05.653 --> 20:07.452
- Yeah.
- Nitin,

20:07.454 --> 20:10.890
when you're finished here,
will you show Jamie to his room?

20:10.892 --> 20:12.924
Absolutely.
Hope you don't mind

20:12.926 --> 20:14.993
getting your hands dirty.
Welcome.

20:14.995 --> 20:16.662
Thank you.

20:16.664 --> 20:19.468
Nitin helps all the new
arrivals the get situated.

20:26.907 --> 20:30.675
And you don't use any water
from the river?

20:30.677 --> 20:34.480
Oh, absolutely not.
The river is sacred to us.

20:34.482 --> 20:36.715
- Uh-huh.
- People have been coming

20:36.717 --> 20:39.484
to this mountain
for thousands of years,

20:39.486 --> 20:41.487
because it is believed

20:41.489 --> 20:45.891
that the crossing of two rivers
is a sacred place,

20:45.893 --> 20:49.994
where your soul can transcend
to a higher realm.

20:49.996 --> 20:54.967
There are many other realms
of consciousness around us

20:54.969 --> 20:59.141
and this mountain is a doorway
to help you access them.

21:01.709 --> 21:03.976
What brings you here?

21:03.978 --> 21:06.010
How did you know about us?

21:06.012 --> 21:07.546
A friend.

21:07.548 --> 21:09.949
Ah... Who?

21:09.951 --> 21:13.555
Just somebody I met. In town.
On my travels.

21:15.857 --> 21:19.258
We're, uh, extremely
out of the way and hard to find,

21:19.260 --> 21:20.960
so I like to know...

21:20.962 --> 21:22.862
No, I get it, you know.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.931
Wouldn't want the secret
to get out. Would we?

21:25.933 --> 21:30.102
Jamie, we do some very hard
work here, inside and out.

21:30.104 --> 21:33.705
And just because you made it
through that gate

21:33.707 --> 21:35.976
doesn't mean you belong here.

21:40.047 --> 21:42.884
Anyway, that's not why
you're here, is it?

21:46.721 --> 21:48.757
You're here for him, aren't you?

21:51.893 --> 21:53.558
(chuckling)

21:53.560 --> 21:56.595
Don't worry.
You'll meet him soon enough.

21:56.597 --> 21:58.263
(laughing)

21:58.265 --> 22:00.569
Make yourself at home.

22:05.005 --> 22:07.074
(whispering voice)

22:18.049 --> 22:19.218
(doctor): <i>Headaches...</i>

22:19.220 --> 22:21.787
<i>Seizures...</i>

22:21.789 --> 22:24.259
- Argh...
- <i>Loss of consciousness...</i>

22:29.096 --> 22:30.766
Ah!

22:32.666 --> 22:34.700
<i>Jamie.</i>

22:34.702 --> 22:37.172
- <i>Jamie...</i>
- Oh...

22:41.242 --> 22:43.110
(knocking)

22:44.611 --> 22:46.612
Jamie.
(knocking)

22:46.614 --> 22:48.784
Jamie!
(loud knocking)

22:52.118 --> 22:55.621
- You okay?
- What time is it?

22:55.623 --> 22:58.660
It's time to roll. Come on.

23:04.130 --> 23:07.999
<i>Once we get down there,
just remember to be silent.</i>

23:08.001 --> 23:10.004
<i>Just do what I do.</i>

23:20.114 --> 23:21.982
(bird chirping)

23:43.169 --> 23:45.069
I know it's your first day.

23:45.071 --> 23:47.208
Try to be on time next time.

23:52.113 --> 23:53.846
Tough love, bro.

23:53.848 --> 23:56.281
Comes from a good place,
though, you know?

23:56.283 --> 23:59.020
She's been through more
than you can imagine.

24:29.783 --> 24:32.353
So what made you become
a seeker?

24:33.887 --> 24:35.820
Something have to make me?

24:35.822 --> 24:38.856
Come on, man. People come
here for two reasons.

24:38.858 --> 24:40.425
They're either running
from something,

24:40.427 --> 24:42.394
or they're running towards it.

24:42.396 --> 24:44.096
Which one are you?

24:44.098 --> 24:45.964
I've been running for years,
man.

24:45.966 --> 24:49.000
I used to try
to turn one dollar into two.

24:49.002 --> 24:51.002
Almost gave myself
a heart attack.

24:51.004 --> 24:55.307
I didn't know how much I was
suffering until it almost killed me.

24:55.309 --> 24:57.442
This place is the real deal,
you know?

24:57.444 --> 25:00.147
You don't really see it until you
start being honest with yourself.

25:07.788 --> 25:10.388
Must be tough,
training the new recruits.

25:10.390 --> 25:13.192
Not really. Just you.

25:13.194 --> 25:15.894
Maybe you knew
a friend of mine.

25:15.896 --> 25:18.396
She passed through here
a while back.

25:18.398 --> 25:22.036
- She's American.
- Well... a lot of people pass through here.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.674
Her name's Sophie.

25:27.407 --> 25:29.209
Pretty name.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.313
Ah, Nitin!

25:34.315 --> 25:36.248
(speaking Hindi)

25:36.250 --> 25:39.417
Oh, shoot, I'm not ready yet.
Alright, come on.

25:39.419 --> 25:41.420
(bell ringing)

25:41.422 --> 25:44.390
Uh, Gayatri, this is Jamie,
Jamie, Gayatri. She'll take you.

25:44.392 --> 25:46.892
- So nice to meet you Jamie.
- And you.

25:46.894 --> 25:48.697
Follow me.

25:52.433 --> 25:54.432
Who are all these people?

25:54.434 --> 25:56.300
They're from surrounding
villages.

25:56.302 --> 25:58.806
They've come to receive
Guruji's blessings.

26:00.241 --> 26:02.274
(excited chatter)

26:02.276 --> 26:05.113
- He's coming.
- Guruji!

26:39.280 --> 26:40.482
Oh!

27:03.037 --> 27:05.306
Guruji.
(speaking Hindi)

27:12.847 --> 27:14.980
What's he doing?

27:14.982 --> 27:17.583
He helps people
transcend their pain.

27:17.585 --> 27:20.318
(Hindi)

27:20.320 --> 27:22.054
(exclamations)
(laughing)

27:22.056 --> 27:24.259
It's amazing, isn't it?

27:25.492 --> 27:28.126
And if it weren't for Guruji,
I'd be dead.

27:28.128 --> 27:30.197
What?

27:31.531 --> 27:35.400
Six years ago, I was diagnosed
with stage-four ovarian cancer.

27:35.402 --> 27:39.137
Doctors told me
I had three months to live.

27:39.139 --> 27:42.409
So I made my way up here and...

27:43.243 --> 27:44.578
...he cured me.

27:46.446 --> 27:49.413
- You have cancer?
- Yes.

27:49.415 --> 27:51.418
He cured you of cancer?

27:52.353 --> 27:54.055
You don't believe me.

27:55.255 --> 27:57.291
I think you believe it.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.429
Belief is all we have.

28:09.136 --> 28:11.439
(group singing)

28:16.609 --> 28:18.579
(coughing)

28:21.115 --> 28:23.284
(singing continues)

28:36.463 --> 28:39.230
- Hey... Sorry.
- Uh, no, no, no.

28:39.232 --> 28:42.067
Hi, Guru. I'm Jamie.
I just wanted to ask you...

28:42.069 --> 28:44.873
I have been waiting so long
for you, my friend.

28:49.409 --> 28:51.977
Bring her to the library.

28:51.979 --> 28:53.515
Chandra!

28:54.615 --> 28:56.615
- What happened?
- Motorcycle accident.

28:56.617 --> 29:00.618
- One hour ago.
- Take her to the library.

29:00.620 --> 29:04.091
- Chandra, what can I do?
- Just nothing right now.

29:05.225 --> 29:07.159
(rumbling)

29:07.161 --> 29:09.130
(woman moaning)

29:12.732 --> 29:15.169
(woman panting)

29:20.473 --> 29:22.340
Hey. Is she okay?

29:22.342 --> 29:24.178
(people chanting)

29:25.378 --> 29:27.648
(panting and chanting)

29:33.988 --> 29:35.657
(moaning)

29:56.242 --> 29:58.546
<i>Jamie! Jamie...</i>

30:03.584 --> 30:05.553
(people chanting)

30:08.789 --> 30:11.059
(rumbling)

30:18.565 --> 30:20.401
(groaning)

30:29.076 --> 30:31.076
Jamie?

30:31.078 --> 30:32.711
Are you okay?

30:32.713 --> 30:34.715
- (sniffling)
- Yeah...

30:38.585 --> 30:40.655
(birdsong)

30:44.425 --> 30:46.426
(bird call)

31:14.821 --> 31:16.556
<i>Jamie.</i>

31:20.126 --> 31:21.762
Something the matter?

31:22.762 --> 31:24.631
Mountains, uh...

31:25.566 --> 31:27.632
Just the altitude, I guess.

31:27.634 --> 31:29.300
Mm.

31:29.302 --> 31:32.139
It can take some time
to adjust here.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.278
Is she okay?

31:41.280 --> 31:42.780
The little girl?

31:42.782 --> 31:44.548
Yes.

31:44.550 --> 31:46.317
Thankfully.

31:46.319 --> 31:48.586
What did the old man do?

31:48.588 --> 31:50.825
Guruji.

31:51.657 --> 31:53.328
I'm sorry.

31:56.496 --> 31:58.498
What did Guruji do?

32:00.166 --> 32:02.534
Performed a miracle.

32:02.536 --> 32:03.805
Miracles.

32:05.172 --> 32:08.539
Give them a lot more credit
than they deserve.

32:08.541 --> 32:10.776
Miracles are a matter
of perspective.

32:10.778 --> 32:13.278
To some,
your cellphone's a miracle.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.813
Yeah, but it's explained.

32:14.815 --> 32:16.781
The science behind that
is rational.

32:16.783 --> 32:19.651
Hmm. Enlighten me.

32:19.653 --> 32:23.524
A phone uses electromagnetic waves to
send your voice all around the world.

32:24.524 --> 32:28.359
Sending your voice
through invisible waves

32:28.361 --> 32:30.194
around the world.

32:30.196 --> 32:32.364
Sounds rational?

32:32.366 --> 32:35.933
So you're telling me
he uses invisible energy?

32:35.935 --> 32:40.505
I'm telling you that miracles
aren't contrary to science.

32:40.507 --> 32:43.909
What else could be
right in front of us,

32:43.911 --> 32:46.211
within us,

32:46.213 --> 32:49.713
that we just don't know yet
how to use.

32:49.715 --> 32:51.485
Hmm?

32:54.354 --> 32:56.758
Come.

33:24.417 --> 33:27.885
I'm gonna show you something
you might find hard to believe.

33:27.887 --> 33:30.590
Please, keep an open mind.

33:46.706 --> 33:48.006
What is this?

33:48.008 --> 33:50.611
The story of this mountain.

33:53.347 --> 33:55.946
Thousands of years ago,

33:55.948 --> 33:58.450
there was a temple here,

33:58.452 --> 34:02.787
and after meditating
for many years in this cave,

34:02.789 --> 34:04.489
this monk...

34:04.491 --> 34:06.624
became enlightened

34:06.626 --> 34:09.929
and shared his wisdom
with the surrounding villagers.

34:10.996 --> 34:13.297
One day...

34:13.300 --> 34:15.866
soldiers from the north came...

34:15.868 --> 34:19.469
and seized the temple
and... destroyed everything.

34:19.472 --> 34:21.672
<i>(screaming)
(swords clashing)</i>

34:21.675 --> 34:26.280
Then there was a period of
great suffering and oppression.

34:27.481 --> 34:29.315
Until...

34:30.382 --> 34:33.817
...this young prince
and princess bore a child.

34:33.819 --> 34:35.553
<i>(baby crying)</i>

34:35.554 --> 34:38.290
This child...

34:38.292 --> 34:40.828
possessed great power within.

34:41.960 --> 34:45.429
And after meditating
for many years in this cave,

34:45.431 --> 34:48.435
he, too, became enlightened.

34:49.502 --> 34:51.069
The monk...

34:51.071 --> 34:53.670
and the child...

34:53.672 --> 34:57.609
are believed to be forms
of an enlightened being,

34:57.611 --> 34:59.644
from another realm,

34:59.646 --> 35:02.980
born into the human world

35:02.982 --> 35:06.888
to end the suffering
of all sentient beings.

35:09.323 --> 35:11.689
This mountain...

35:11.691 --> 35:13.725
is that gateway...

35:13.727 --> 35:15.696
to that realm.

35:18.064 --> 35:21.899
This princess
is the caretaker...

35:21.901 --> 35:25.102
who helps him transition...

35:25.104 --> 35:28.506
in and out of this world.

35:28.508 --> 35:30.645
And with her help...

35:32.879 --> 35:37.852
...he has been reincarnating
for thousands of years.

35:39.819 --> 35:41.655
Our Guruji.

35:43.723 --> 35:46.424
We aren't the first ones
to realize

35:46.426 --> 35:49.928
that there is something
so beautiful happening here.

35:49.930 --> 35:53.401
Things I never thought
could be possible.

35:54.801 --> 35:58.039
You just have to choose
to see them.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.640
<i>This place is so beautiful,</i>

36:02.642 --> 36:04.109
<i>Jamie.</i>

36:04.111 --> 36:06.578
<i>There are things
happening here</i>

36:06.580 --> 36:09.446
<i>I never thought
could be possible.</i>

36:09.448 --> 36:11.918
<i>I just had to choose
to see them.</i>

36:14.153 --> 36:16.756
<i>And for the first time...
(sniffling)</i>

36:18.591 --> 36:21.959
<i>...I'm really getting to know
who I am.</i>

36:21.961 --> 36:26.434
<i>I hope you get to know who
you really are too, Jamie.</i>

36:31.437 --> 36:33.874
<i>I'm so sorry
we didn't work out.</i>

36:36.443 --> 36:38.446
<i>At least in this life.</i>

36:43.450 --> 36:45.953
<i>Maybe we'll meet
in the next one.</i>

36:48.187 --> 36:50.957
<i>Take care of yourself, Jamie.</i>

37:02.968 --> 37:04.704
(clatter)

37:10.810 --> 37:12.847
Hey.
(grunting)

37:13.814 --> 37:16.448
- Why'd you lie to me?
- What the hell are you talking about?

37:16.450 --> 37:18.183
You knew Sophie.
She passed through here.

37:18.185 --> 37:20.517
Told you I don't know
who she was...

37:20.519 --> 37:23.120
Don't lie to me.
You train all the new recruits.

37:23.122 --> 37:24.825
I know you knew her.

37:26.126 --> 37:28.662
Okay. Take your hands off me.

37:33.499 --> 37:35.135
I got you.

37:46.513 --> 37:48.716
I have to find her.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.685
She left because of me.

37:55.021 --> 37:57.524
You've no idea
how much this means to me.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.928
Is there a problem here?

38:02.896 --> 38:04.895
- No. We were just...
- It was my fault.

38:04.897 --> 38:07.564
I was at the water pump and,
um,

38:07.566 --> 38:10.067
Nitin spooked me by accident.

38:10.069 --> 38:11.836
It's fast reflexes.

38:11.838 --> 38:14.542
- Nitin?
- It's fine.

38:25.051 --> 38:28.556
Meet me at the riverbank
at dawn; bring your boots.

38:50.276 --> 38:52.209
Nice to see you're on time.

38:52.211 --> 38:53.914
Hey.

38:55.781 --> 38:57.314
Where we going?

38:57.316 --> 39:00.954
You wanted to know
what happened to Sophie, right?

39:09.763 --> 39:11.598
(bird calls)

39:15.100 --> 39:16.771
(birdsong)

39:34.787 --> 39:36.921
Here.

39:36.923 --> 39:39.260
Found this spot a week ago.

39:41.227 --> 39:43.062
(panting)

39:44.731 --> 39:46.566
<i>Hey.</i>

39:57.276 --> 39:59.112
I'm sorry.

40:00.613 --> 40:03.147
Does anyone else know
about this?

40:03.149 --> 40:04.819
No.

40:06.185 --> 40:08.289
How long was she here?

40:09.622 --> 40:13.290
Three months. She disappeared
about two weeks ago.

40:13.292 --> 40:16.629
She and the Guruji
were very close.

40:18.832 --> 40:20.798
What's that supposed to mean?

40:20.800 --> 40:22.933
I'm just telling you
what I heard.

40:22.935 --> 40:25.069
They spent a lot of time
together,

40:25.071 --> 40:27.607
made a lot of people jealous,
especially Chandra.

40:34.347 --> 40:36.180
What happened?

40:36.182 --> 40:37.915
I honestly don't know.

40:37.917 --> 40:42.252
The last couple of times
I saw her, she wasn't herself.

40:42.254 --> 40:47.058
Look, it's not really my place, but
instead of looking for Sophie,

40:47.060 --> 40:50.030
maybe you should find out
what she was looking for.

40:51.196 --> 40:54.200
I better get back
before Chandra notices I'm gone.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.970
Why are you helping me?

41:00.707 --> 41:02.643
It's the right thing to do.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.981
She seemed very special.
I hope you find her.

41:38.745 --> 41:41.078
I have something for you.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.247
What is it?

41:43.249 --> 41:45.783
<i>Two souls...</i>

41:45.785 --> 41:49.486
<i>You're bound to each other...
for all eternity.</i>

41:49.488 --> 41:52.890
So one's for you
and one's for me,

41:52.892 --> 41:57.263
and as long as we wear them...
we'll always be connected.

41:59.298 --> 42:01.198
<i>D'you make this?</i>

42:01.200 --> 42:02.866
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:02.868 --> 42:05.403
Getting better.

42:05.405 --> 42:07.274
Shut up.

42:11.810 --> 42:14.178
<i>Do you like it?</i>

42:14.180 --> 42:16.116
It's beautiful.

42:18.283 --> 42:20.417
I love it.

42:20.419 --> 42:24.321
<i>I wanted to make something for us.
Kind of representing...</i>

42:24.323 --> 42:27.290
where we've been
and where we are

42:27.292 --> 42:29.028
and where we're going.

42:32.031 --> 42:34.133
<i>Where we going?</i>

42:35.968 --> 42:38.136
<i>I don't know.
(chuckling)</i>

42:38.138 --> 42:39.906
<i>Somewhere special.</i>

42:41.807 --> 42:43.309
<i>I hope.</i>

43:55.515 --> 43:57.518
(background chatter)

44:03.890 --> 44:06.189
Jamie, where have you been?

44:06.191 --> 44:08.227
- For a walk.
- Have you seen Nitin?

44:09.229 --> 44:10.528
What happened?

44:10.530 --> 44:12.395
You can't just disappear
like that.

44:12.397 --> 44:14.131
Yeah, I know. I know.

44:14.133 --> 44:16.901
No, you don't know
what she's capable of.

44:16.903 --> 44:19.205
What do you mean?

44:20.339 --> 44:22.973
Just focus
on your own progress, okay?

44:22.975 --> 44:25.144
That's where
you'll find answers.

44:38.925 --> 44:40.390
(knocking)

44:40.392 --> 44:42.028
Nitin?

44:58.443 --> 45:00.211
Nitin left.

45:00.213 --> 45:02.312
What do you mean?

45:02.314 --> 45:03.850
Left the Ashram?

45:16.963 --> 45:19.196
When you experience pain,

45:19.198 --> 45:22.301
you are functioning
at conscious level.

45:24.604 --> 45:27.307
But when you transcend pain...

45:29.975 --> 45:33.944
...you experience the true
nature of consciousness.

45:33.946 --> 45:35.613
(words echoing)

45:35.615 --> 45:38.549
Confront the darkness
within you...

45:38.551 --> 45:42.153
and you will see the light.

45:42.155 --> 45:44.087
(echoing)

45:44.089 --> 45:47.493
Consciousness
is not only within us.

45:48.627 --> 45:51.265
It's all around us.
(echoing)

45:53.499 --> 45:56.066
...your consciousness...

45:56.068 --> 45:58.171
...with that of the universe.

46:14.687 --> 46:17.191
(Sophie):
<i>We're bound to each other.</i>

46:32.171 --> 46:34.607
(bird cawing)

47:24.589 --> 47:26.593
(birds trilling)

47:31.097 --> 47:33.533
(Guruji):
You are making progress.

47:34.801 --> 47:38.272
But your journey
is far from over.

47:42.607 --> 47:44.611
We are running out of time.

47:45.644 --> 47:48.748
You still carry too much fear.

47:51.450 --> 47:54.287
You must learn to let it go.

48:03.562 --> 48:05.162
Oh, Guruji.

48:05.164 --> 48:07.466
You must heal him.

48:08.767 --> 48:10.633
Are you sure?

48:10.635 --> 48:13.303
Be of pure intent.

48:13.305 --> 48:15.207
(wind howling)

48:17.310 --> 48:20.180
(bird chirping)
(Gujuri speaking Hindi)

48:27.620 --> 48:29.489
(peeping)

48:35.127 --> 48:37.430
(high-pitched chirping)

48:45.671 --> 48:47.540
Oh, no!

48:52.412 --> 48:54.348
(panting)

48:58.917 --> 49:02.453
No, please. Let me try again.

49:02.455 --> 49:04.191
Give.

49:18.537 --> 49:21.340
(chirping)
(gasping)

49:26.412 --> 49:28.578
We are finished here.

49:28.580 --> 49:30.383
Please, Guruji...

49:31.850 --> 49:34.218
There is still time.

49:34.220 --> 49:38.221
Time is not the issue.
It's your intention.

49:38.223 --> 49:42.562
You will never be
the caretaker.

49:58.743 --> 50:00.881
You can send the boy in.

50:24.437 --> 50:26.272
(sniffling)

50:34.446 --> 50:36.282
You found my spot.

50:41.521 --> 50:43.323
It's beautiful.

50:44.457 --> 50:47.461
It helps me remember
why I'm here.

50:50.463 --> 50:52.562
What do you want?

50:52.564 --> 50:54.934
I just wanted
to say thank you.

50:56.635 --> 50:58.669
I'm starting to understand...

50:58.671 --> 51:00.640
what it is you do here.

51:04.943 --> 51:07.310
Guruji knew this too.

51:07.312 --> 51:09.915
He's asked to see you.

51:11.484 --> 51:13.319
You can go up now.

51:15.955 --> 51:18.658
Jamie, you tell me
what happens up there.

51:31.836 --> 51:33.506
(panting)

51:37.977 --> 51:39.679
Hello?

51:44.684 --> 51:47.521
- (fluttering)
- May I offer you some tea?

51:49.854 --> 51:51.522
No, thanks.

51:51.524 --> 51:54.761
I need to tell you something
very important.

51:55.861 --> 51:57.761
Are you listening to me?

51:57.763 --> 51:59.833
Yeah.

52:02.602 --> 52:05.739
A cup of tea
is always a good idea.

52:10.542 --> 52:12.878
Come. Sit down.

52:14.546 --> 52:17.381
Do you know why you are here?

52:17.383 --> 52:19.616
To drink tea?

52:19.618 --> 52:22.622
You are here
because you know something.

52:23.622 --> 52:26.390
Not on conscious level,

52:26.392 --> 52:29.896
but deep down,
you always knew it.

52:31.731 --> 52:33.564
And now,

52:33.566 --> 52:37.571
finally you have come here
to find the truth.

52:38.571 --> 52:40.404
What do I know?

52:40.406 --> 52:43.406
That there is
a universal consciousness

52:43.408 --> 52:45.743
that connects us all.

52:45.745 --> 52:47.580
Is there?

52:48.914 --> 52:51.582
Of course there is.

52:51.584 --> 52:53.419
Your soul.

52:55.421 --> 52:58.055
(fluttering and chirping)

52:58.057 --> 53:00.823
- What are you doing?
- You have a secret here,

53:00.825 --> 53:03.796
which is causing you
great suffering.

53:10.935 --> 53:15.071
Guruji, I didn't come here
to find the truth.

53:15.073 --> 53:17.073
I came here to find a friend.

53:17.075 --> 53:18.776
I know.

53:18.778 --> 53:23.113
But I'm talking
about what is in your brain.

53:23.115 --> 53:27.551
You must not carry this weight
alone.

53:27.553 --> 53:29.953
- It will destroy...
- Look...

53:29.955 --> 53:33.957
I don't know what you think
you know... but I'm fine.

53:33.959 --> 53:35.792
There's no secret.

53:35.794 --> 53:38.095
You can lie to others,

53:38.097 --> 53:40.734
but you can never lie
to yourself.

53:45.071 --> 53:47.071
You know what?

53:47.073 --> 53:50.841
Fine. Everybody else needs
your approval round here.

53:50.843 --> 53:52.979
I sure as hell don't.

53:55.013 --> 53:57.814
You have a gift.

53:57.816 --> 54:00.116
You can experience...

54:00.118 --> 54:03.486
the universal consciousness...

54:03.488 --> 54:05.824
that surrounds us.

54:08.827 --> 54:11.828
You can feel the beat

54:11.830 --> 54:14.166
of all living things.
(chirping)

54:24.176 --> 54:27.147
There are many things
within you.

54:28.580 --> 54:30.913
Only you can choose
to see them.

54:30.915 --> 54:32.519
(panting)

54:38.890 --> 54:41.026
- (panting)
- What was that?

54:42.995 --> 54:44.864
We are done for today.

54:53.171 --> 54:54.973
(rumbling)

55:09.053 --> 55:10.723
(sighing)

55:30.609 --> 55:32.746
(crickets chirring)

55:38.184 --> 55:40.082
(peeping)

55:40.084 --> 55:43.020
Jamie?
What are you doing here?

55:43.022 --> 55:44.988
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

55:44.990 --> 55:47.827
- Gayatri?
- Nothing.

55:53.765 --> 55:55.234
Stop!

55:59.238 --> 56:00.940
Gimme the bag!

56:03.107 --> 56:05.111
- (gasping)
- No!

56:10.950 --> 56:13.250
- What is this?
- Just herbs.

56:13.252 --> 56:15.352
- Are you drugging us?
- What?!

56:15.354 --> 56:17.354
- No!
- Is that what this is?

56:17.356 --> 56:21.091
Is that why I'm seeing all this shit?
Are you drugging us?!

56:21.093 --> 56:22.959
No! It's just medicine!
It's medicine.

56:22.961 --> 56:25.328
- For what?!
- I'm just taking it to Guruji.

56:25.330 --> 56:27.767
What's wrong with him?

56:31.736 --> 56:33.238
He's dying.

56:35.640 --> 56:37.841
What do you mean, he's dying?

56:37.843 --> 56:41.144
He's dying. Guruji's dying,
and we can't tell anybody.

56:41.146 --> 56:44.281
People here have devoted their lives
to him, and if they find out,

56:44.283 --> 56:46.752
can you imagine
what will happen?

56:48.821 --> 56:50.953
Gayatri...

56:50.955 --> 56:52.992
You knew Sophie.

56:55.260 --> 56:56.896
I know you did.

56:58.830 --> 57:00.363
What did she say?

57:00.365 --> 57:03.902
If you know something,
you have to tell me.

57:07.673 --> 57:09.175
Is she alive?

57:11.676 --> 57:14.343
- Is she alive?
- I have to go.

57:14.345 --> 57:16.779
- No. Please.
- Yes. I have to go.

57:16.781 --> 57:20.053
No one talks to me.
You have to tell me.

57:21.185 --> 57:23.986
She's not the only reason
you're here.

57:23.988 --> 57:26.323
Please don't follow me.

57:26.325 --> 57:28.027
Please.

57:29.193 --> 57:30.696
Gayatri...

57:35.700 --> 57:37.401
<i>One, two, three.
(grunting)</i>

57:37.403 --> 57:40.037
Two. Pull it.
(all): Pull!

57:40.039 --> 57:42.673
- (grunting)
- Slowly. Easy, easy...

57:42.675 --> 57:45.274
(indistinct chatter)

57:45.276 --> 57:47.144
What?!

57:47.146 --> 57:48.879
You do this every time.

57:48.881 --> 57:50.680
- (grunting)
- Got it?

57:50.682 --> 57:53.015
- Yeah.
- Pull! Pull! (grunting)

57:53.017 --> 57:56.188
- One more, one more...
- That's it. Pull!

57:57.722 --> 58:00.057
Wait, it's stuck.
Hold on, guys!

58:00.059 --> 58:02.725
It's stuck. Hold on.
I can get it out.

58:02.727 --> 58:04.694
Okay? Hold on.

58:04.696 --> 58:07.430
Hold on, guys.
Almost got it, almost got it.

58:07.432 --> 58:09.966
(grunting)

58:09.968 --> 58:12.069
Yeah! Hold on!
(grunting)

58:12.071 --> 58:15.375
Come on! Only got two seconds,
guys, two seconds.

58:19.044 --> 58:21.912
- Watch out!!
- Argh!

58:21.914 --> 58:24.383
- (screaming) - No!
- Ah!!!

58:26.885 --> 58:28.854
(screaming)

58:43.167 --> 58:44.937
(indistinct chatter)

59:02.955 --> 59:05.988
- <i>It's just a number!</i>
- <i>So the fact that the day we met,</i>

59:05.990 --> 59:10.861
my birthday and your promotion all
happened on the 23rd means nothing.

59:10.863 --> 59:13.229
It's just a coincidence.
There's no higher meaning.

59:13.231 --> 59:16.966
It means something to me!
Why won't you just let me have...

59:16.968 --> 59:19.104
Because it's bullshit!
It's a fucking lie!

59:38.156 --> 59:40.059
I can't do this anymore.

59:41.093 --> 59:43.192
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

59:43.194 --> 59:45.263
I mean us.

59:46.464 --> 59:48.999
This isn't working.

59:49.001 --> 59:51.133
So what are you saying?

59:51.135 --> 59:53.470
We're different people.

59:53.472 --> 59:56.105
We want different things.
You want kids...

59:56.107 --> 59:58.575
Is that what this is about?
I told you, I'm okay waiting.

59:58.577 --> 01:00:01.944
No. It's not just that.
It's...

01:00:01.946 --> 01:00:03.849
Then what is it?

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:11.154
Whatever it is,
we can get through it.

01:00:11.156 --> 01:00:14.024
- No, we can't.
- Of course we can.

01:00:14.026 --> 01:00:17.093
Because we love each other and
that's what being in love means.

01:00:17.095 --> 01:00:18.962
It means being there
for each other.

01:00:18.964 --> 01:00:21.932
I don't love you anymore!

01:00:21.934 --> 01:00:24.169
Okay?

01:00:26.504 --> 01:00:30.809
So the sooner you get that
through your head, the better.

01:00:33.044 --> 01:00:36.214
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do.

01:00:38.517 --> 01:00:40.520
It's over.

01:00:44.156 --> 01:00:46.059
<i>It's over.</i>

01:01:11.917 --> 01:01:13.419
(bird cawing)

01:01:32.171 --> 01:01:34.173
Did you stop that beam?

01:01:35.173 --> 01:01:37.576
Did you know you could do that?

01:01:41.146 --> 01:01:43.950
Did the Guruji teach you
something, huh?

01:01:45.383 --> 01:01:48.120
Jamie, did he share a secret
with you?

01:01:55.459 --> 01:01:57.394
Jamie...

01:01:57.396 --> 01:02:01.064
he shared that secret
with Sophie as well.

01:02:01.066 --> 01:02:02.602
Yeah.

01:02:03.968 --> 01:02:05.905
She was here.

01:02:07.705 --> 01:02:09.608
And Jamie...

01:02:10.676 --> 01:02:12.609
...the realities...

01:02:12.611 --> 01:02:15.477
that you're beginning
to experience,

01:02:15.479 --> 01:02:17.482
Sophie experienced them too.

01:02:18.584 --> 01:02:21.183
It was too much for her,

01:02:21.185 --> 01:02:22.921
so she ran away.

01:02:23.988 --> 01:02:26.324
I figured she ran back to you.

01:02:27.626 --> 01:02:30.328
Then you come here
looking for her.

01:02:32.631 --> 01:02:35.167
I can tell you had hurt her.

01:02:38.636 --> 01:02:41.671
Why would you have
thrown her away?

01:02:41.673 --> 01:02:43.341
Why?

01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:48.214
I'm dying.

01:02:52.517 --> 01:02:54.453
I have a brain tumour.

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:02.361
And I don't have long.

01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:07.033
And I never told her.

01:03:15.039 --> 01:03:18.376
Maybe Sophie
came into your life...

01:03:20.044 --> 01:03:22.379
...just to lead you here.

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:24.216
Don't you see?

01:03:25.216 --> 01:03:27.052
You have a gift.

01:03:29.421 --> 01:03:32.388
We're meant to do great things
together.

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:35.560
Guruji doesn't have
much time left.

01:03:43.401 --> 01:03:45.070
(bird cawing)

01:04:04.823 --> 01:04:06.591
(cawing)

01:04:15.399 --> 01:04:17.734
No! No! No!

01:04:17.736 --> 01:04:20.339
No, no, no! No! No.

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:27.113
(cawing)

01:04:42.461 --> 01:04:45.127
- (indistinct chatter)
- I'm sure.

01:04:45.129 --> 01:04:46.631
I'm sure...

01:04:47.765 --> 01:04:49.769
Jamie?

01:04:52.636 --> 01:04:54.370
Jamie!

01:04:54.372 --> 01:04:55.772
Jamie...

01:04:55.774 --> 01:04:59.308
Jamie, you cannot go up there
like this!

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:03.178
- Did you know?
- Know what? What's the matter?

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.615
- Nitin.
- Nitin what? What happened? What?

01:05:05.617 --> 01:05:07.616
Did you kill him?

01:05:07.618 --> 01:05:09.651
Don't lie to me.

01:05:09.653 --> 01:05:11.654
- Nitin...
- 'Cause he was helping me?

01:05:11.656 --> 01:05:13.659
No. I... I...

01:05:14.626 --> 01:05:18.294
Jamie, please. Please don't
bring this up to him!

01:05:18.296 --> 01:05:20.196
Get up.

01:05:20.198 --> 01:05:21.663
Wake up!

01:05:21.665 --> 01:05:23.332
You knew.

01:05:23.334 --> 01:05:25.769
You knew this whole time.

01:05:25.771 --> 01:05:28.604
Oh, Guruji, I'm so sorry.
I tried to stop him.

01:05:28.606 --> 01:05:30.372
And you want...

01:05:30.374 --> 01:05:32.674
Nitin. Nothing goes on here
without your knowledge!

01:05:32.676 --> 01:05:35.444
Are you accusing Guruji
of having something to do...

01:05:35.446 --> 01:05:38.448
- I'm not talking to you!
- Don't you yell in here, Jamie.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:40.850
- Don't you raise your voice.
- Chandra, please leave us.

01:05:40.852 --> 01:05:44.254
- Guruji is in no condition...
- Chandra!

01:05:44.256 --> 01:05:45.758
Do as I say.

01:05:57.535 --> 01:05:58.935
Come.

01:05:58.937 --> 01:06:01.207
- Sit down.
- No.

01:06:02.307 --> 01:06:03.939
Somebody's dead.

01:06:03.941 --> 01:06:06.709
He devoted his life to you
and you don't even care.

01:06:06.711 --> 01:06:08.214
Of course I care.

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:15.852
She thinks she's protecting me,

01:06:15.854 --> 01:06:19.392
but her pain is blinding her.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.861
I have a fear...

01:06:24.863 --> 01:06:27.466
what will happen after I go.

01:06:28.566 --> 01:06:29.868
Guruji.

01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:33.572
I need to know.

01:06:34.972 --> 01:06:39.477
If I keep digging out there, am I
gonna find Sophie's body, as well?

01:06:42.647 --> 01:06:43.883
Please.

01:06:44.883 --> 01:06:46.783
I need to know.

01:06:46.785 --> 01:06:48.754
I'm sorry.

01:06:50.455 --> 01:06:53.426
I was waiting
until you were ready.

01:07:00.598 --> 01:07:02.901
There is something you must see.

01:07:36.801 --> 01:07:38.634
What is this place?

01:07:38.636 --> 01:07:40.305
A doorway.

01:07:44.609 --> 01:07:46.743
Sophie.

01:07:46.745 --> 01:07:48.747
Sophie!

01:07:51.716 --> 01:07:54.283
Sophie. Sophie, hey. Hey, babe.

01:07:54.285 --> 01:07:56.653
Soph. Soph?

01:07:56.655 --> 01:07:58.854
Sophie.

01:07:58.856 --> 01:08:02.327
Hey, come here. It's me.
I found you. I found you.

01:08:04.796 --> 01:08:06.828
Sophie?

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:08.497
(panting)

01:08:08.499 --> 01:08:10.235
Sop...

01:08:15.774 --> 01:08:19.008
Aren't those keeping you alive?

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:21.479
It's for keeping her alive.

01:08:25.448 --> 01:08:28.518
Hey, baby. Hey, wake up.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.256
Soph, wake up.

01:08:32.591 --> 01:08:35.791
- Why won't she wake up?
- She is in a state...

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:38.694
of deep meditation.

01:08:38.696 --> 01:08:39.996
So deep...

01:08:39.997 --> 01:08:43.633
that her soul has left her body

01:08:43.635 --> 01:08:46.102
and cannot find
its way back in.

01:08:46.104 --> 01:08:49.339
- Is she in a coma?
- No.

01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:51.707
She is in a realm
between life and death.

01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:54.376
That's bullshit.
Wake up, Soph!

01:08:54.377 --> 01:08:57.013
Gently. Gently!

01:08:57.015 --> 01:08:59.349
We have to get her
to a hospital!

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:02.488
If you remove her from here,
she will die!

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:13.028
You did this.

01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:16.633
You did this and you left her
lying here for weeks.

01:09:16.635 --> 01:09:19.902
I was trying to help her...

01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:23.406
but she carried too much pain.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:27.943
I took her to the other realm
so she could transcend it.

01:09:27.944 --> 01:09:29.913
But she was trapped there.

01:09:30.913 --> 01:09:32.484
It's my fault.

01:09:38.055 --> 01:09:40.523
How can I believe
anything you say?

01:09:40.524 --> 01:09:43.595
Believing... is your choice.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.636
What do you mean, trapped?

01:10:21.632 --> 01:10:23.468
(rumbling)

01:10:29.641 --> 01:10:31.477
(breathing)

01:10:53.498 --> 01:10:55.163
Sophie!

01:10:55.165 --> 01:10:56.834
(echoing)

01:10:59.637 --> 01:11:02.074
Sophie!

01:11:07.846 --> 01:11:09.147
Jamie.

01:11:10.848 --> 01:11:12.517
(panting)

01:11:14.119 --> 01:11:15.854
Soph.

01:11:18.655 --> 01:11:20.156
Soph.

01:11:20.158 --> 01:11:23.526
You were right...
this whole time.

01:11:23.528 --> 01:11:25.161
You were right.

01:11:25.163 --> 01:11:27.866
Guruji, we gotta go back.

01:11:30.168 --> 01:11:32.171
Guruji.

01:11:33.538 --> 01:11:35.040
Guruji.

01:11:44.681 --> 01:11:46.551
(rumbling)

01:12:01.632 --> 01:12:03.568
(panting)

01:12:27.758 --> 01:12:32.027
No. No, no, no, no, no!

01:12:32.029 --> 01:12:33.598
No!

01:12:41.071 --> 01:12:42.841
(whispering)

01:13:07.265 --> 01:13:09.001
(cawing)

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.145
(Chandra): Come.
There's much to be done.

01:13:29.153 --> 01:13:30.987
<i>We will miss our Guruji.</i>

01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:34.624
But this is not his end,

01:13:34.626 --> 01:13:36.928
only his new beginning.

01:13:37.995 --> 01:13:40.795
And today we will celebrate...

01:13:40.797 --> 01:13:44.166
the sending of his spirit
to the next realm,

01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:48.073
so he may be born again
and return to us.

01:13:59.182 --> 01:14:01.787
Hey. Come on, okay?

01:14:10.128 --> 01:14:11.630
(whispering)

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:21.306
Where was she
when you saw her?

01:14:24.876 --> 01:14:28.310
- She was on a cliff.
- Jamie, when our soul crosses

01:14:28.312 --> 01:14:30.712
into the other realm,

01:14:30.714 --> 01:14:33.448
we must confront
our darkest moment.

01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:36.355
And overcome it
in order to come back.

01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:40.224
Does this cliff
mean something to you?

01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:45.027
Yeah.

01:14:45.029 --> 01:14:47.833
But if Guruji couldn't save her,
how can I?

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:52.702
Sacred crossing.

01:14:52.704 --> 01:14:54.740
(breathing deeply)

01:15:09.253 --> 01:15:10.952
The sacred crossing

01:15:10.954 --> 01:15:14.959
provides a path for the
enlightened one to return.

01:15:17.729 --> 01:15:20.198
It's not the crossing of rivers.

01:15:21.966 --> 01:15:23.936
It's the crossing of souls.

01:15:25.203 --> 01:15:27.406
Sophie always said
we were soulmates.

01:15:29.473 --> 01:15:31.974
I didn't believe her.

01:15:31.976 --> 01:15:35.443
If you are connected
to each other beyond this life,

01:15:35.445 --> 01:15:38.246
then maybe you share
your darkest moment.

01:15:38.248 --> 01:15:41.052
Then we have to transcend it
together.

01:15:49.994 --> 01:15:52.294
Jamie... whatever happens...

01:15:52.296 --> 01:15:56.301
just be honest with yourself.

01:15:57.301 --> 01:15:59.471
You're getting a second chance.

01:16:13.083 --> 01:16:15.319
(panting)
Chandra?

01:16:16.954 --> 01:16:18.487
- Where is he?
- Wait. No, no, no!

01:16:18.489 --> 01:16:20.959
He needs me right now!
He can't be in there!

01:16:52.056 --> 01:16:56.192
I am the caretaker, not you!
Not you!

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:59.428
Sophie's not...

01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:01.999
Sophie's... inside?

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:20.285
Hey.

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:29.061
What are you doing here?

01:17:32.395 --> 01:17:34.065
Come home with me.

01:17:35.098 --> 01:17:37.867
Soph, you have to come
with me now.

01:17:37.869 --> 01:17:40.603
If you don't, I'm not sure
you're ever gonna be able

01:17:40.605 --> 01:17:43.275
- to come back.
- It's too late. It's over.

01:17:44.408 --> 01:17:48.042
- Doesn't have to be. Okay?
- Yes, it does.

01:17:48.044 --> 01:17:50.578
This is something I have to do
on my own.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.581
I have to find it within me
to let you go.

01:17:53.583 --> 01:17:56.184
- What if we're not supposed to let each other go?
- Don't.

01:17:56.186 --> 01:17:58.586
- What if we're supposed to do this together?
- We're not together!

01:17:58.588 --> 01:18:01.557
- Yeah, we are.
- No, we're not! You left.

01:18:01.559 --> 01:18:03.427
You completely disappeared.

01:18:04.494 --> 01:18:07.395
We had something special,
but you threw it away.

01:18:07.397 --> 01:18:10.569
And you have no idea
how much that hurt me.

01:18:13.937 --> 01:18:15.970
I'm sorry I hurt you.

01:18:15.972 --> 01:18:18.443
You know what? I'm sorry too.

01:18:38.962 --> 01:18:42.197
I thought we were gonna be
together forever,

01:18:42.199 --> 01:18:44.602
but... I was wrong.

01:18:46.137 --> 01:18:47.606
No, Soph.

01:18:48.605 --> 01:18:51.273
You were right.

01:18:51.275 --> 01:18:53.612
You and I are always together.

01:18:54.712 --> 01:18:57.478
And we always will be.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.150
Jamie...

01:19:00.618 --> 01:19:03.488
How could I ever trust you
again?

01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:15.464
What are you doing?

01:19:15.466 --> 01:19:19.268
You and I were meant
to bring Guruji back,

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:22.537
but you betrayed me
just like everyone else.

01:19:22.539 --> 01:19:26.075
You have to help me...
bring Sophie back.

01:19:26.077 --> 01:19:28.277
We don't need her.

01:19:28.279 --> 01:19:30.045
We never did.

01:19:30.047 --> 01:19:33.285
It's a shame
she'll never know the truth.

01:19:34.284 --> 01:19:37.288
You're living on borrowed time.

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:54.138
What happened?

01:19:56.473 --> 01:19:59.010
I need to tell you something.

01:20:02.245 --> 01:20:04.449
I'm dying.

01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:09.421
I was diagnosed
with a brain tumour.

01:20:11.288 --> 01:20:13.390
And they can't save me.

01:20:14.725 --> 01:20:16.561
That's why I left.

01:20:19.297 --> 01:20:21.596
Why didn't you tell me?

01:20:21.598 --> 01:20:24.168
I didn't want
to put you through it.

01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:29.406
But the truth is...
I was scared you'd leave me.

01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:32.707
You didn't even give me
a chance.

01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:34.678
I know.

01:20:37.515 --> 01:20:40.418
And not a day goes by
I don't regret it.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.321
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:20:45.323 --> 01:20:48.389
I don't expect you to come back.

01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:51.492
You just deserve
to know the truth.

01:20:51.494 --> 01:20:53.198
I'm so sorry.

01:20:54.731 --> 01:20:57.269
I hope you can forgive me.

01:20:59.537 --> 01:21:01.272
(heartbeat)

01:21:11.481 --> 01:21:13.350
(rumbling)

01:21:20.591 --> 01:21:22.459
(panting)

01:21:23.194 --> 01:21:26.131
I'll take care of Sophie, too.

01:21:31.267 --> 01:21:33.570
(rasping)

01:21:37.307 --> 01:21:38.776
Ah!! Ah!

01:21:48.386 --> 01:21:50.155
(panting)

01:21:51.321 --> 01:21:52.790
Jamie!

01:21:54.324 --> 01:21:55.793
Jamie?

01:21:58.695 --> 01:22:00.895
Come back to me.

01:22:00.897 --> 01:22:03.232
(panting)
Jamie...

01:22:03.234 --> 01:22:05.666
please come back.
Please come back, Jamie.

01:22:05.668 --> 01:22:08.370
I forgive you.
I forgive you, Jamie.

01:22:08.372 --> 01:22:10.842
Please...

01:22:16.846 --> 01:22:18.816
(crying softly)

01:22:21.485 --> 01:22:23.352
(gasping)

01:22:23.354 --> 01:22:25.520
Oh, Jamie.

01:22:25.522 --> 01:22:27.191
Jamie!

01:22:33.631 --> 01:22:36.264
- (Sophie laughing)
- Don't let me go.

01:22:36.266 --> 01:22:37.866
Don't let me go.

01:22:37.868 --> 01:22:39.835
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.

01:22:39.837 --> 01:22:41.539
I won't.

01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:46.310
I won't.

01:23:12.735 --> 01:23:14.571
(birdsong)

01:23:25.248 --> 01:23:26.684
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:23:28.586 --> 01:23:29.887
And?

01:23:36.427 --> 01:23:38.363
What does that mean?

01:23:42.833 --> 01:23:45.267
You got the bottle?

01:23:45.269 --> 01:23:46.771
Yeah.

01:24:30.713 --> 01:24:32.950
Ah, shhh...

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.591

01:24:40.824 --> 01:24:42.590
What?

01:24:42.592 --> 01:24:44.863
It's a miracle.
