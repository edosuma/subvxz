00:19.767 --> 00:21.500
- DID YOU FEEL THAT
HE WAS HONEST WITH YOU

00:21.500 --> 00:23.867
ABOUT THE STATE
OF HIS RELATIONSHIP?

00:23.867 --> 00:25.133
- NO.

00:25.133 --> 00:27.133
- IT WAS TOO LITTLE
TOO LATE.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.667

01:18.367 --> 01:21.300
WELL, DECKHAND BRUNO
COULD NOT BE WITH US TODAY

01:21.300 --> 01:23.066
BECAUSE OF A VISA ISSUE,

01:23.066 --> 01:25.200
BUT HE'S GONNA BE
JOINING US BY SKYPE LATER.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.500
AND DECKHAND CHRIS BROWN
DECLINED OUR INVITATION

01:29.500 --> 01:32.767
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE HE'S UPSET
HE WAS FIRED FROM THE CREW

01:32.767 --> 01:36.467
OR BECAUSE HIS POST FIRING
PREDICTION CAME TRUE,

01:36.467 --> 01:39.300
AND HE IS VERY BUSY
GETTING LAID.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.633
I THINK IT'S THE LATTER.

01:40.633 --> 01:43.300
UH, I HAVE A HULL OF A LOTTA
QUESTIONS FOR ALL OF YOU,

01:43.300 --> 01:45.033
SO LET'S SHOVE OFF.

01:45.033 --> 01:48.600
I HAVE A TON OF
YACHTIE PUNS, AS WELL.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.967
BAKER, I FOUND OUT SOMETHING
FASCINATING ABOUT YOU.

01:51.967 --> 01:55.300
YOU ARE
THOMAS RAVENEL'S COUSIN.

01:55.300 --> 01:58.333
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
HE IS MY STEP UNCLE, BUT--

01:58.333 --> 02:00.934
- HE'S YOUR STEP UNCLE?
- MY STEP UNCLE, YEAH.

02:00.934 --> 02:02.066
- WOW!

02:02.066 --> 02:07.100
NICO, UM, BEFORE YOU JOINED
THE CREW FOR SEASON FIVE,

02:07.100 --> 02:08.767
UH, YOUR BROTHER
PASSED AWAY.

02:08.767 --> 02:09.800
- MM-HMM.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.767
- I KNOW THAT,
UH, LAST MONTH,

02:11.767 --> 02:13.934
YOU SCATTERED
YOUR BROTHER'S ASHES.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.200
- A FEW-- A FEW WEEKS AGO,
ON HIS ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY,

02:16.200 --> 02:18.100
UH, MY FAMILY AND I
WENT TO MEXICO

02:18.100 --> 02:21.200
AND, UH, SPREAD
HIS ASHES THERE.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.934
- HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOIN'?

02:22.934 --> 02:23.934
- UH, GOOD, GOOD.

02:23.934 --> 02:25.934
WE'RE TAKING IT MORE
IN A POSITIVE LIGHT,

02:25.934 --> 02:28.834
UH, NOW THAT WE'VE GONE
THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS

02:28.834 --> 02:32.467
AND, OBVIOUSLY, WORKING ON
THE TRISTAN SCOTT FOUNDATION

02:32.467 --> 02:35.200
TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR
ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.233
- THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY
A REALLY HARD TIME WITH YOU.

02:38.233 --> 02:41.934
WHY GO ON THE CREW
OF THE "VALOR,"

02:41.934 --> 02:44.533
UH, INSTEAD OF STAYING HOME
WITH YOUR FAMILY?

02:44.533 --> 02:46.567
- TWO MONTHS AFTER HE PASSED,
I MADE THE DECISION,

02:46.567 --> 02:49.166
AND IT WAS A VERY, VERY
TOUGH DECISION TO MAKE,

02:49.166 --> 02:51.900
UH, BUT, AT THAT POINT,
I WAS ACTUALLY STILL,

02:51.900 --> 02:54.266
UH, IN ST. MARTIN
BEFORE I JOINED THE BOAT,

02:54.266 --> 02:58.533
AND I JUST TOOK IT AS,
UH, KIND OF RUNNING AWAY,

02:58.533 --> 03:01.233
I GUESS YOU'D SAY, BUT
I WAS GRIEVING IN MY OWN WAY.

03:01.233 --> 03:02.667
- YEAH.

03:02.667 --> 03:05.633
WELL, THIS CHARTER SEASON,
CAPTAIN LEE HAD TO HIRE A CREW

03:05.633 --> 03:09.266
SO GREEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW
THEIR STEM FROM THEIR STERN,

03:09.266 --> 03:14.433
AND THAT MADE CAPTAIN LEE
EXTREMELY STERN. WATCH.

03:14.433 --> 03:17.300
- WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT
TO CHOOSE FROM FOR CREW,

03:17.300 --> 03:19.533
SO THE CREAM OF THE CROP
IS PRETTY MUCH TAKEN.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.967
- UNHOOK IT.
- TAKE IT OFF.

03:20.967 --> 03:21.867
- BRUNO.
- STOP MOVING.

03:21.867 --> 03:22.767
- BRUNO.
- STOP, RIGHT THERE.

03:22.767 --> 03:23.834
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

03:23.834 --> 03:25.200
- IT'S ABOUT TO HIT
THIS OTHER JET SKI.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.967
- I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THE DECK CREW.

03:26.967 --> 03:28.100
----ING IDIOTS.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.900
UH, WE GOT CUSHIONS
OVER THE SIDE.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.300
[splash]
- AHH! (BLEEP)!

03:31.300 --> 03:33.000
- IT DID BURN.
- I'M ALREADY LOST.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.200
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHERE THIS GOES.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.400
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE'RE-- RIGHT?

03:35.400 --> 03:36.333
- YEAH, I KNOW.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.633
I WAS LIKE, I HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON.

03:37.633 --> 03:38.500
- YEP.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.567
WE'RE TALKIN'
50 SHADES OF GREEN.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.467
DECK CREW,
DECK CREW, KATE.

03:41.467 --> 03:43.133
- NOBODY ANSWERING
YOUR RADIO.

03:43.133 --> 03:44.500
LET'S GET THAT
STERN LINE OFF.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.967
- WATCH YOUR BOW!
WATCH YOUR BOW!

03:45.967 --> 03:47.400
[bang]
- GODDAMN IT!

03:47.400 --> 03:49.700
I AM MADDER THAN
A PISSED ON CHICKEN.

03:49.700 --> 03:50.767
- CHRIS? CHRIS?

03:50.767 --> 03:52.433
HE WAS IN HIS BUNK.
- SLEEPING?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.100
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CUT YOU LOOSE.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.900
- COOL.
- NO, IT'S NOT COOL.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.300
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO POUR AN OUNCE?

03:57.300 --> 03:58.200
- NO.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.233
[sighs]

03:59.233 --> 04:00.667
- COFFEES-- DO YOU GUYS
KNOW HOW TO DO LATTES?

04:00.667 --> 04:01.934
- I KNOW HOW TO WORK
A KEURIG.

04:01.934 --> 04:03.033
- ALL RIGHT.

04:03.033 --> 04:04.333
- YOU WOULD CUT IT LOOSE
WITHOUT THE ----ING ENGINES

04:04.333 --> 04:05.500
RUNNING WHY?

04:05.500 --> 04:06.667
- LET'S TOW ME OUTTA HERE.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.533
- WE END UP LOOKIN'
LIKE GODDAMNED IDIOTS.

04:08.533 --> 04:09.900
SON OF A BITCH.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.066
I DON'T, FOR A SECOND,

04:11.066 --> 04:13.266
BELIEVE THAT
EVERYBODY IN THIS CREW

04:13.266 --> 04:15.400
PERFORMED UP TO
THEIR POTENTIAL.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.200
THERE WILL BE
CONSEQUENCES.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.700
[sighs]

04:18.700 --> 04:20.266
I'M ----ED.

04:20.266 --> 04:22.533
- UH, CAPTAIN LEE,
KATIE FROM OHIO SAID,

04:22.533 --> 04:24.300
"WHO WOULD YOU
WORK WITH, AGAIN?

04:24.300 --> 04:26.867
"WHO WOULD YOU
NOT WORK WITH, AGAIN?"

04:26.867 --> 04:28.233
- CAN I TAKE
THE FIFTH, ANDY?

04:28.233 --> 04:29.367
- OH, NO.

04:29.367 --> 04:30.233
[laughing]

04:30.233 --> 04:32.000
- WOULD YOU WORK
WITH JEN, AGAIN?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.433
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:33.433 --> 04:34.900
HONEST ANSWER--
I DON'T KNOW.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.600
- YOU WOULDN'T WORK WITH
CHRIS BROWN, AGAIN.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.734
- NO.

04:37.734 --> 04:38.934
- BRUNO?

04:38.934 --> 04:40.066
- JURY'S OUT.

04:40.066 --> 04:41.900
- UM, ELLEN FROM KINGSTON,
NEW YORK,

04:41.900 --> 04:43.433
"KATE, YOU SEEMED
MISERABLE.

04:43.433 --> 04:45.500
WAS THIS SEASON WORSE THAN
NORMAL 'CAUSE YOU GOT STUCK

04:45.500 --> 04:46.834
"WITH GREEN STEWS?"

04:46.834 --> 04:48.800
- YEAH, I MEAN,
IT WAS EXTRA WORK FOR ME.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.934
AND THEN, ON TOP OF THAT,
I'M SPLITTING EVEN TIPS

04:50.934 --> 04:52.500
WITH PEOPLE THAT
I'M DOING EXTRA WORK FOR,

04:52.500 --> 04:54.300
AND THEY DON'T APPRECIATE IT
'CAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW

04:54.300 --> 04:56.100
HOW MUCH EXTRA WORK I'M DOING,
SO THAT'S NOT GREAT.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.533
- EMMA FROM CINCINNATI
SAID, "NICO,

04:58.533 --> 05:00.567
"YOU SAW NO IMPROVEMENT
IN CHRIS,

05:00.567 --> 05:02.800
"BUT, EJ, YOU WERE
MORE HOPEFUL.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.700
"EJ, DO YOU THINK SOMEONE ELSE
SHOULD'VE ELSE BEEN FIRED?"

05:05.700 --> 05:07.800
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
CHRIS HAD SOME GOOD,

05:07.800 --> 05:09.300
STRONG WORK ETHIC,
YOU KNOW?

05:09.300 --> 05:12.000
HE, UH, HE SHOWED
INITIATIVE AT LEAST.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.233
BRUNO KINDA FELT ENTITLED
TO A LOTTA STUFF,

05:14.233 --> 05:16.667
AND SO IT WAS
KIND OF ON THE FENCE
BETWEEN BRUNO AND THEM.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.500
I DIDN'T SEE
WHAT HAPPENED PRIOR,

05:18.500 --> 05:20.467
BUT, RIGHT IN MY FACE,

05:20.467 --> 05:22.467
YOU KNOW, CHRIS WAS
PULLIN' HIS WEIGHT.

05:22.467 --> 05:23.934
- CARRIE FROM
NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID,

05:23.934 --> 05:26.900
"CAPTAIN LEE,
DO YOU THINK YOU MADE THE
RIGHT CHOICE IN FIRING CHRIS?

05:26.900 --> 05:28.400
"WAS HE THE WORST
OF THE BUNCH?"

05:28.400 --> 05:29.667
- ABSOLUTELY.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.100
- UM, BAKER, ROB FROM
NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA

05:32.100 --> 05:33.734
SAID, "CHRIS SAID
WHEN HE WAS FIRED

05:33.734 --> 05:36.100
"THAT HE WAS DEALT
A SH---Y HAND.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.867
"DO YOU FEEL LIKE
HE WAS FIRED UNFAIRLY?"

05:38.867 --> 05:41.367
- UM, I WOULDN'T--
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HE WAS,

05:41.367 --> 05:43.333
I WOULD SAY,
THE WEAKEST LINK.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.867
UM, I THINK THE UNFAIR THING
IS TO THROW SOMEONE

05:45.867 --> 05:48.367
ON A CHARTER YACHT
WITH NO EXPERIENCE,

05:48.367 --> 05:50.300
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
GONNA SINK OR SWIM.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.667
- I PERSONALLY THINK KATE
AND I GOT DEALT A SH-- HAND.

05:52.667 --> 05:53.800
- NO.
- RIGHT.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.834
[laughing]
- I AGREE.

05:54.834 --> 05:55.900
- OOF.
- WELL, THANKS.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.467
- HE WASN'T-- HE WASN'T A--
HE WASN'T A BAD GUY.

05:57.467 --> 05:58.567
- I COMMEND YOU GUYS,
THOUGH.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.800
- AS A PERSON,
CHRIS IS AN AMAZING PERSON.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.900
- YEAH.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.667
- I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY
VERY FUNNY AND VERY SMART,

06:02.667 --> 06:05.000
BUT THE WORK ETHIC
THAT HE HAD WAS LIKE

06:05.000 --> 06:07.300
I'M JUST GONNA DO
WHATEVER AND GET BY.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.000
- KYLE, ASHLEY
FROM LITTLE ROCK SAID,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.333
"WHAT WAS THE MOOD
LIKE ONBOARD

06:10.333 --> 06:11.467
"WHEN YOU JOINED
THE CREW?

06:11.467 --> 06:13.433
"COULD YOU TELL THE DECKHANDS
HAD BEEN THROUGH A LOT?"

06:13.433 --> 06:14.500
[sighs]
- WHEN I ARRIVED,

06:14.500 --> 06:17.567
IT JUST FELT-FELT LIKE
HEADLESS CHICKENS.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.233
AND THEN,
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN,

06:19.233 --> 06:20.600
CAPTAIN LEE
USED TO COME DOWN,

06:20.600 --> 06:21.600
CRACK THE WHIP,

06:21.600 --> 06:22.800
AND PEOPLE STARTED
COMING IN LINE.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.967
IT JUST--
IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL--

06:23.967 --> 06:25.233
IT WASN'T MY "VALOR."

06:25.233 --> 06:26.900
- WELL, AS LEAD DECKHAND,

06:26.900 --> 06:28.900
NICO TRIED TO WHIP
THE "VALOR'S" GREEN CREW

06:28.900 --> 06:31.467
INTO SHAPE,
BUT WHEN CAPTAIN LEE DECIDED

06:31.467 --> 06:34.600
TO BRING ON EJ,
AN EXPERIENCED BOSUN,

06:34.600 --> 06:38.967
NICO DID NOT WANT THAT GUY
BOSUN HIM AROUND.

06:38.967 --> 06:42.200
[laughing]
AND THEY BOTH
GOT A LITTLE SALTY.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.467
- HOW'S IT GOIN'?
- EJ.

06:43.467 --> 06:44.567
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:44.567 --> 06:46.166
- THIS IS YOUR NEW BOSUN.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.400
- NO ----ING WAY.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.500
A LOT OF FRICTION.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.033
- WELL, IT'S STRANGE THAT
IT WOULD EVEN MOVE, RIGHT?

06:50.033 --> 06:51.500
I SHOULD'VE CHECKED IT.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.000
I THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD'VE
ALREADY DONE THAT.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.266
- WELL, THAT'S WHY
IT'S SO HOT.

06:55.266 --> 06:57.166
THE GEARS ARE WORKING UP
AGAINST THE BRAKE.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.400
- I GOTTA DOUBLE CHECK
EVERYTHING

06:59.400 --> 07:02.133
'CAUSE THESE GUYS ARE JUST
A BUNCH OF NUMPTIES.

07:02.133 --> 07:03.266
- WATCH YOURSELF.

07:03.266 --> 07:05.000
- THESE GUYS, THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN TAUGHT PROPERLY.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
WHAT WAS NICO TEACHING 'EM
FOR FOUR WEEKS?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.066
SOME OF THESE WINDOWS
ARE STILL A LITTLE SALTY.

07:09.066 --> 07:10.166
- BRUNO'S BEEN
DOIN' THE WINDOWS.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.367
IT'S BEEN FINE.

07:11.367 --> 07:13.033
- BUT, IN THE END OF THE DAY,
THIS IS HOW IT TURNS OUT.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.767
- I'M TAKING CONTROL.
THIS IS MY BOAT.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.867
I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR
SHOES OFF MY DECK.

07:16.867 --> 07:18.567
- IT'S MY DECK NOW,
BUDDY BOY.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.367
- EITHER YOU ----IN'
TAKE OFF YOUR STRIPES

07:20.367 --> 07:21.767
AND PUT IT ON MY BED,

07:21.767 --> 07:23.633
OR, TOMORROW,
I'LL TAKE MY STRIPES,

07:23.633 --> 07:25.533
AND YOU CAN ----IN'
PUT IT UP YOUR ASS.

07:25.533 --> 07:27.500
- LET'S SEE THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR FEET, HOMEY.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.066
- GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

07:29.066 --> 07:31.734
I GOTTA BE THE BIGGER MAN
AND WALK AWAY.

07:31.734 --> 07:33.633
- EJ WILL BE
LEAVIN' US TODAY.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.500
HE'S GOTTA GET BACK
TO HIS OTHER BOAT.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.400
- BYE.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.033
- OKAY, SO, NICO,
WOULD YOU HAVE HAD ISSUES

07:40.033 --> 07:42.100
WITH ANY BOSUN
JOINING THE CREW,

07:42.100 --> 07:44.100
OR WAS IT EJ,
SPECIFICALLY?

07:44.100 --> 07:45.900
- WELL, THERE'S TWO THINGS
A-ABOUT THAT.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.500
UH, AND FIRST
AND FOREMOST,

07:47.500 --> 07:49.166
UH, I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY
I TREATED YOU.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.967
IT'S PAINFUL
TO ACTUALLY WATCH.

07:50.967 --> 07:53.834
UH, TO-- IT'S JUST I WAS
A WHOLE 'NOTHER PERSON

07:53.834 --> 07:56.333
COMPLETELY,
AND THAT WAS BAD.

07:56.333 --> 07:59.400
BUT, I THINK MENTALLY
WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH,

07:59.400 --> 08:01.867
IS A LOT OF STRESS WITH
OBVIOUSLY MY PERSONAL LIFE,

08:01.867 --> 08:05.066
AND THEN THESE GUYS,
AND KEEP SCREWING UP,

08:05.066 --> 08:07.333
AND FEELING LIKE
IT WAS MY FAULT, AND I--

08:07.333 --> 08:09.567
IT WAS LIKE THE CAMEL'S--
THE STRAW THAT BROKE

08:09.567 --> 08:11.233
THE CAMEL'S BACK.
ANYONE THAT WOULDA CAME,

08:11.233 --> 08:12.900
I PROBABLY WOULD'VE
BEEN THAT WAY

08:12.900 --> 08:15.667
'CAUSE I FELT A LITTLE BIT
HURT FROM CAPTAIN

08:15.667 --> 08:18.233
'CAUSE I FELT LIKE I WAS
TRYING TO PROVE TO HIM

08:18.233 --> 08:20.900
THAT I COULD BE THE GUY
THAT HE COULD COUNT ON.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.967
- CAPTAIN LEE, WHEN YOU SAW IT
UNFOLD ON THE SHOW--

08:23.967 --> 08:25.166
- I--
- DID YOU THINK,
AT THAT POINT,

08:25.166 --> 08:28.133
NICO DESERVED TO BE BOSUN?
- OH, HELL NO.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.900
- SAMMY FROM CHICAGO SAID,
"DURING THE FIGHT ON THE BOAT

08:30.900 --> 08:32.667
"AFTER THE NIGHT OUT,
YOU TOLD EJ,

08:32.667 --> 08:37.600
"'IF I'M NOT BOSUN TOMORROW,
I QUIT.' LOOKING BACK,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.834
"CAN YOU ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT
A SPOILED BRAT YOU LOOKED LIKE

08:39.834 --> 08:41.667
"WHEN YOU SAID IT?"

08:41.667 --> 08:42.967
- WE'RE REALLY GETTIN'
INTO ME TODAY.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.033
[laughing]
- YES.

08:44.033 --> 08:45.333
- UH--
- PEOPLE ARE PISSED, NICO.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.367
- I KNOW.
I UNDERSTAND,

08:46.367 --> 08:47.500
AND THEY HAVE
THE RIGHT TO,

08:47.500 --> 08:51.133
BUT, UM, I HONESTLY DID
WANT TO LEAVE AT THAT TIME.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.166
- YOU DID?

08:52.166 --> 08:53.467
- AND I WAS--
I WAS READY TO GO.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.834
- AND SO, HOW DID YOU
TAKE IN NICO'S APOLOGY?

08:56.834 --> 08:59.367
- YOU KNOW, I KINDA SEEN IT
AS HALFHEARTED, YOU KNOW?

08:59.367 --> 09:01.400
IT'S LIKE HE WAS KINDA
JUST SAYIN' SORRY

09:01.400 --> 09:03.166
TO GET THROUGH,
YOU KNOW?

09:03.166 --> 09:06.400
BUT, HONESTLY, I KNEW
DEEP DOWN HE WAS NOT LIKING

09:06.400 --> 09:08.567
THE SITUATION,
AND HE WASN'T GONNA CHANGE.

09:08.567 --> 09:12.033
- UH, WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS
AS YOU'VE SEEN THINGS

09:12.033 --> 09:15.967
FROM NICO THAT YOU HADN'T
SEEN BEFORE THE SHOW AIRED?

09:15.967 --> 09:18.233
- I NEVER WOULD'VE
GIVEN HIM THE PROMOTION.

09:18.233 --> 09:20.000
- YOU WOULDN'T?
- NO.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.300
- WHY?
- DIDN'T EARN IT.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.767
- WHY DID YOU GIVE IT TO HIM,
AND WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

09:24.767 --> 09:28.000
- I-I DIDN'T SEE
THE CHILDISH BEHAVIOR

09:28.000 --> 09:31.400
ALL THROUGH THE SEASON
THAT HE WAS EXHIBITING,

09:31.400 --> 09:34.400
UM, AND I DIDN'T
APPRECIATE IT,

09:34.400 --> 09:36.000
AND THAT TELLS ME

09:36.000 --> 09:38.767
THAT HE HADN'T GONE THROUGH
THE MATURATION PROCESS

09:38.767 --> 09:40.333
TO THE LEVEL
THAT HE SHOULD'VE

09:40.333 --> 09:42.734
TO BE ABLE TO LEAD
A CREW PROPERLY.

09:42.734 --> 09:44.233
- HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT?

09:44.233 --> 09:45.400
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
PRETTY HARD TO HEAR.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.800
I MEAN, I-I FEEL
LIKE I DID,

09:46.800 --> 09:48.700
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT
THE WHOLE MATURITY LEVEL,

09:48.700 --> 09:50.600
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ACTING THAT WAY,

09:50.600 --> 09:52.166
AND IT WAS
OUT OF CHARACTER,

09:52.166 --> 09:54.400
BUT I DO FEEL LIKE
I DID EARN THAT POSITION,

09:54.400 --> 09:56.166
AND I CAN TAKE ON
THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.700
- I THINK HE WENT THROUGH SH--
TO GET THROUGH THE SEASON,

09:57.700 --> 09:59.100
AND HE PROBABLY
EARNED IT.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.300
- FAIR PLAY.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.700
- YOU ALSO-- I MEAN, HE ALSO
STARTED OUT THE CONVERSATION

10:02.700 --> 10:06.700
BY SAYING THAT HE'S INCREDIBLY
REMORSEFUL FOR HIS BEHAVIOR.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.934
- THAT'S A HINDSIGHT THING.

10:08.934 --> 10:11.266
THAT'S A MONDAY MORNING
QUARTERBACK THING.

10:11.266 --> 10:14.500
THE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT
IS IN THE MOMENT--

10:14.500 --> 10:16.533
NOT APOLOGIZE
FOR YOUR SCREW UP

10:16.533 --> 10:18.700
AFTER IT'S ALL DONE AND
OVER WITH AND SAY,

10:18.700 --> 10:20.867
"WELL, I'M GONNA BLAME THIS.
I'M GONNA BLAME THAT.

10:20.867 --> 10:23.066
"I WASN'T MYSELF.
I WAS THIS. I WAS THAT."

10:23.066 --> 10:25.667
I DON'T CARE.
WE HAVE A JOB TO DO.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.767
YOU DO THE JOB,
YOU STEP UP TO THE PLATE,

10:27.767 --> 10:29.000
OR YOU BACK AWAY

10:29.000 --> 10:30.834
AND ACCEPT THE HELP
THAT YOU WERE GIVEN.

10:30.834 --> 10:33.800
HE NEEDED HELP,
I GAVE HIM HELP,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.400
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE
THE COMMON SENSE

10:35.400 --> 10:37.867
TO APPRECIATE THE HELP
THAT HE WAS GIVEN.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.667
- FAIR COMMENT?
- ABSOLUTELY.

10:40.667 --> 10:41.900
- COMING UP...

10:41.900 --> 10:44.333
- IF I HAD MORE FEELINGS
INVESTED IN NICO,

10:44.333 --> 10:46.200
I THINK WOULD
FOR SURE BE HURT.

10:46.200 --> 10:54.100
♪♪♪

10:54.200 --> 10:54.533
- WE'RE BACK WITH

10:54.533 --> 10:54.800
- WE'RE BACK WITH
THE "BELOW DECK"

10:55.266 --> 10:56.233
SEASON FIVE REUNION.

10:56.233 --> 10:57.967
I'M ANDY COHEN WITH
THE CREW OF THE "VALOR."

10:57.967 --> 11:01.233
FROM KATE'S COME TO JESUS
MOMENT TO ALMOST EVERY GUY

11:01.233 --> 11:03.433
TRYING TO GET
A BITE OF BRI

11:03.433 --> 11:06.066
AND EJ'S FAILURE TO RISE
TO THE OCCASION

11:06.066 --> 11:08.667
WITH BAKER,
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE

11:08.667 --> 11:12.500
WAS CRUISING EACH OTHER,
HOPING TO FIRST MATE.

11:13.767 --> 11:15.367
- THAT ASS.
- ON BRI?

11:15.367 --> 11:16.533
- IN THOSE WHITE PANTS,

11:16.533 --> 11:18.367
I WOULD TOTALLY LICK
HER BALLOON KNOT.

11:20.367 --> 11:21.700
- JEN JUST NEEDS
TO GET LAID.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.834
SOMEONE NEEDS TO HELP
THIS POOR GIRL OUT.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.633
[laughing]

11:27.633 --> 11:30.333
[screaming]

11:30.333 --> 11:31.800
- JESUS WAS THERE.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.033
JESUS CAME.

11:33.033 --> 11:34.367
I SAW GOD TWICE.

11:34.367 --> 11:35.500
- YES!

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
- WHAT'S UP, BRUNO?

11:36.500 --> 11:37.900
I WANT THE ONE
ON THE STAR.

11:37.900 --> 11:40.567
[laughing]

11:40.567 --> 11:41.900
- THIS IS GREAT.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.066
- YEP, AND THAT'S MY BUTT.

11:44.066 --> 11:45.900
- YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO LEAVE.

11:47.233 --> 11:48.333
- PLEASE SAY YES.
PLEASE SAY YES.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.433
- I DON'T WANNA
MAKE THINGS AWKWARD.

11:51.433 --> 11:53.200
THIS GUY IS
OBVIOUSLY DRUNK.

11:53.667 --> 11:56.066
- I'LL TAKE YOU OUT.

11:56.066 --> 11:57.567
- WHAT IF I DON'T
WANNA GO OUT?

11:57.567 --> 11:59.300
MAY I?

12:00.734 --> 12:02.000
- DO YOU WANNA BANG?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.700
[laughing]

12:04.700 --> 12:07.200
- BAKER,
GONNA MISS YA.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.166
- MISS YOU, TOO,
BOO-BOO.

12:09.166 --> 12:10.900
- TIME FLIES
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.700
- MM-HMM.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.166
[groans]

12:14.166 --> 12:15.433
OH, WELL.

12:15.433 --> 12:16.467
- THAT WAS AN AWESOME
PUSH-UP.

12:16.467 --> 12:18.667
- OH, MY GOD.
OKAY, SO MUCH TO DISCUSS.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.367
FIRST OF ALL,
WHO'S SINGLE, NOW?

12:23.467 --> 12:24.633
- OKAY.
- KINDA.

12:24.633 --> 12:25.867
- WELL, PRETTY MUCH
EVERYONE.

12:25.867 --> 12:27.433
- I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA SAY NO FOR ONCE.

12:27.433 --> 12:28.700
- YOU'RE NOT SINGLE?

12:28.700 --> 12:29.934
- I'M GONNA-- NO.

12:29.934 --> 12:30.900
NOPE.
- OKAY.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.934
EJ, WHY COULDN'T YA
SEAL THE DEAL?

12:32.934 --> 12:36.033
IT-IT SEEMED LIKE
A LAY UP, IF I CAN SAY.

12:36.033 --> 12:38.467
- WELL, YOU KNOW, IT--
UH, I REALLY LIKED BAKER.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.000
WE WERE GETTIN' ALONG
REAL WELL,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.633
BUT, UM,
IN THE END OF THE DAY,

12:42.633 --> 12:44.700
NOW I'M GONNA KISS HER
AND THEN LEAVE?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.367
YOU KNOW,
IT JUST SEEMED WRONG,

12:46.367 --> 12:49.667
AND, UH, CAPTAIN LEE HIRED ME
ON HERE TO DO MY JOB,

12:49.667 --> 12:51.433
AND MY JOB IS NOT
TO HOOK UP WITH CREW.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.900
SO, WHILE I WAS STARTIN'
TO LIKE HER

12:53.900 --> 12:55.567
AND GET ALONG WITH HER,

12:55.567 --> 12:56.934
A PART OF ME
WAS LIKE,

12:56.934 --> 12:59.100
WELL, THIS ISN'T REALLY
WHAT I'M HERE TO DO.

12:59.100 --> 13:02.233
- BAKER, WERE YOU SURPRISED
HE NEVER PUT THE MOVES ON YOU?

13:02.233 --> 13:04.667
- UM, NO, NO, BECAUSE--

13:04.667 --> 13:07.433
'CAUSE EJ IS NOT
AGGRESSIVE, HONESTLY.

13:07.433 --> 13:08.800
[laughing]

13:08.800 --> 13:11.433
- I CAN BE BUT GIVEN
THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY.

13:11.433 --> 13:12.500
[laughing]

13:12.500 --> 13:13.767
- HAD HE PUT
THE MOVES ON YOU,

13:13.767 --> 13:16.033
WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN
RECEPTIVE?

13:16.033 --> 13:18.367
- OH, I MEAN, NOTHIN' WRONG
WITH A LITTLE KISSY-KISS.

13:18.367 --> 13:19.367
- YEAH.

13:19.367 --> 13:20.500
WOULD YOU GO OUT TONIGHT?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.433
YOU'RE IN NEW YORK CITY.
THE NIGHT IS YOUNG.

13:22.433 --> 13:23.633
- HEY.
- WE'RE NOT ON "VALOR."

13:23.633 --> 13:24.567
- THE NIGHT IS YOUNG.

13:24.567 --> 13:27.834
- OKAY, MATT AND BRI--
UM, MATT,

13:29.333 --> 13:31.533
YOU GOT SO HAMMERED
ON THE DATE.

13:31.533 --> 13:32.967
- YES, I DID,
ABSOLUTELY.

13:32.967 --> 13:35.033
- BRI, HAD HE
NOT BEEN SO DRUNK,

13:35.033 --> 13:37.367
DO YOU THINK THINGS WOULD'VE
WORKED OUT DIFFERENTLY?

13:37.367 --> 13:38.767
I MEAN, DID YOU--
- I THINK IT WOULD'VE--

13:38.767 --> 13:40.734
LIKE, JUST MUCH
SMOOTHER DATE FOR SURE.

13:40.734 --> 13:41.867
- RIGHT.

13:41.867 --> 13:43.600
I MEAN, GOING INTO THE DATE,
WAS THERE A PART OF YOU

13:43.600 --> 13:45.200
THAT WAS LIKE, HEY,
HE'S REALLY HANDSOME?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.333
I'M-I'M INTO THIS.
- YES, OF COURSE.

13:46.333 --> 13:47.533
- YEAH.
- THAT'S WHY I AGREED.

13:47.533 --> 13:48.467
- YEAH.

13:48.467 --> 13:50.633
- AND HE PACKED
AN EPIC PICNIC AND THEN--

13:50.633 --> 13:52.200
- DO YOU REGRET
GETTING SO DRUNK?

13:52.200 --> 13:53.033
- IT'S FINE.

13:53.033 --> 13:53.967
IT WORKED OUT
FOR THE BEST.

13:53.967 --> 13:54.800
IT WAS-- IT WAS OKAY.
- IT DID?

13:54.800 --> 13:55.667
- YEAH.

13:55.667 --> 13:56.567
- WHY DID IT WORK OUT
FOR THE BEST?

13:56.567 --> 13:57.934
- WELL, BECAUSE WE ARE
WORKING TOGETHER.

13:57.934 --> 13:59.266
YOU KNOW, WE WOULD'VE--
I DON'T KNOW.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.467
WE WORKED SO CLOSE
TOGETHER IN THE GALLEY.

14:00.467 --> 14:01.700
- YEAH, WE WERE ALWAYS,
LIKE, YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.500
- SO, KIND OF A-
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE.

14:03.500 --> 14:07.633
- SO, YOUR CURRENT SITUATION
IS THAT YOU ARE DATING SOMEONE.

14:09.066 --> 14:09.900
- UH--

14:09.900 --> 14:10.900
- IS THIS THE MUSICIAN?
- YES.

14:10.900 --> 14:11.800
- IT IS, ISN'T IT?
- YEAH.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.633
- OH, OKAY.

14:12.633 --> 14:13.500
- HE WAS JUST HERE
IN NEW YORK.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.633
HE JUST LEFT YESTERDAY.
- OH, GREAT.

14:14.633 --> 14:18.233
- UM, WE'RE NOT DATING YET,
BUT I THINK I'M IN LOVE.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.400
- WOW.
- OH.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.867
- ----ING YOU'RE THAT
STRONG IN IT?

14:20.867 --> 14:21.934
- NOT DATING YET,
BUT YOU THINK YOU'RE IN LOVE.

14:21.934 --> 14:23.133
- YEAH.
- AWW.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.033
- WHOA.

14:24.033 --> 14:25.900
- KATE, HOW WAS, UH,
HOW WAS HOT JESUS?

14:25.900 --> 14:29.500
- HOT, KIND,
INTELLIGENT, SWEDISH.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.300
- STEPHIE FROM ORANGE COUNTY
WANTS TO KNOW,

14:31.300 --> 14:32.467
"MEN OR WOMEN?

14:32.467 --> 14:34.200
WHAT'S GOIN' ON WITH YOU?"
- DEFINITELY MEN.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.567
- DEFINITELY MEN.
- YEAH.

14:35.567 --> 14:36.633
- OKAY.

14:36.633 --> 14:40.400
JEN, UM, GOTTA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

14:40.400 --> 14:44.200
UH, WITH THE CHARTER GUEST,

14:44.200 --> 14:46.100
UH, WHO GRABBED
YOUR BUTT.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.333
- MM-HMM.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.066
- UM, DID THEY REALLY ASK YOU
TO JOIN THEM IN A THREESOME?

14:50.066 --> 14:51.934
- THEY DIDN'T
VERBALLY SAY THAT,

14:51.934 --> 14:53.500
BUT I THINK IT WAS
SUGGESTED.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.166
- IT WAS--
SEEMED IMPLIED TO ME.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.767
- ABSOLUTELY, YES.
- YES.

14:56.767 --> 15:01.433
OKAY, NICKI FROM, UH,
PERTH AMBOY, NEW JERSEY SAID,

15:01.433 --> 15:04.700
"KATE, UM, WHY DIDN'T YOU
ADDRESS THE SEXUAL ASSAULT

15:04.700 --> 15:07.333
"ON JEN FROM A GUEST
TO THE CAPTAIN?"

15:07.333 --> 15:09.033
- FIRST OF ALL,
I DIDN'T SEE IT MYSELF.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.066
- UH-HUH.

15:10.066 --> 15:11.533
- THE WAY THAT JEN
COMMUNICATED IT TO ME

15:11.533 --> 15:15.033
WAS MORE LIKE JOKING
THAT THESE GUESTS WERE DRUNK

15:15.033 --> 15:16.066
AND OUT OF CONTROL,

15:16.066 --> 15:17.233
BUT THAT HAPPENS
A LOT ON BOATS.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.467
- RIGHT.

15:18.467 --> 15:21.367
- UM, IT'S NOT RIGHT,
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,

15:21.367 --> 15:23.467
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
DOES HAPPEN A LOT ON YACHTS.

15:23.467 --> 15:26.033
WE'RE IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS,
WHERE PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN DO

15:26.033 --> 15:27.967
WHATEVER THEY WANT,
THERE'S LOTS OF ALCOHOL,

15:27.967 --> 15:30.734
AND, UM, I THINK WHEN PEOPLE
REACH THAT LEVEL OF WEALTH,

15:30.734 --> 15:32.300
THEY THINK
THEY CAN BUY ANYTHING.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.300
- UH-HUH.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.200
- I DON'T THINK
SHE MEANT TO BE AGGRESSIVE.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.433
- IT WASN'T PREMEDITATED.

15:36.433 --> 15:37.633
- AND I WENT DOWN WITH YOU
TO MAKE SURE YOU WEREN'T ALONE.

15:37.633 --> 15:40.500
I-- KNOWING WHAT I KNEW,

15:40.500 --> 15:42.400
I THINK I HANDLED IT
APPROPRIATELY.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.567
WE WEREN'T GONNA
CANCEL THE CHARTER.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.867
- RIGHT.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.000
SO, YOU MADE SURE
SHE WASN'T ALONE WITH
THAT GUEST ANYMORE.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.033
- I MADE SURE
SHE WASN'T ALONE.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.133
I GAVE HER
A RAPE WHISTLE.

15:48.133 --> 15:49.400
I MEAN--
[laughing]

15:49.400 --> 15:50.633
- CLOSE THE DOOR.
- DECORATIVE.

15:50.633 --> 15:52.767
- DO YOU-- CAPTAIN LEE,
DID SHE HANDLE IT CORRECTLY?

15:52.767 --> 15:53.900
- I BELIEVE SHE DID.
YES.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.033
- YEAH.

15:55.033 --> 15:57.333
WERE YOU MADE AWARE OF
THE INCIDENT WHEN IT HAPPENED,

15:57.333 --> 16:00.467
OR DID YOU FIND OUT AFTER,
OR WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT?

16:00.467 --> 16:02.133
- I FOUND OUT
WHEN I WATCHED IT ON TV.

16:02.133 --> 16:03.500
- OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.
- NO.

16:03.500 --> 16:07.000
- SO, DID YOU THINK THAT
KATE SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.867
- I THINK-- I THINK KATE
ACTUALLY HANDLED IT PROPERLY.

16:09.867 --> 16:15.633
I THINK SHE SEPARATED
JEN FROM THE INDIVIDUAL.

16:15.633 --> 16:18.700
UH, THERE'S NO REASONING
WITH A DRUNK.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.200
THAT'S JUST NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.133
AND SHE DIDN'T ALLOW HER
TO BE EXPOSED

16:24.133 --> 16:26.600
AND BE ALONE WITH THAT
INDIVIDUAL AGAIN.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.700
- I GUESS-- YEAH.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.800
- AND IF IT HAD RISEN
TO THE LEVEL

16:29.800 --> 16:31.200
WHERE I NEEDED
TO GET INVOLVED,

16:31.200 --> 16:32.567
THEN, YEAH, I'D OF
TURNED THE BOAT AROUND.

16:32.567 --> 16:33.667
WE WOULD'VE WENT BACK
TO THE DOCK,

16:33.667 --> 16:35.066
AND THEY'D HAD BEEN
WALKIN' HOME.

16:35.066 --> 16:36.367
- OKAY, I WANNA MOVE ON.

16:36.367 --> 16:40.700
NICO AND BRI SEEMED LIKE THE
CLASSIC BUOY MEETS GIRL STORY

16:40.700 --> 16:43.133
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH NICO
HAD A GIRL AT HOME,

16:43.133 --> 16:46.000
AT SEA,
BRI WAS HIS ANCHOR

16:46.000 --> 16:50.500
WHEN THINGS GOT ROUGH
UNTIL HE DRIFTED AWAY.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.433
- NICO.
- JEN.

16:51.433 --> 16:52.734
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:52.734 --> 16:54.467
- HI, NICO.
- LONG TIME, NO SEE.

16:54.467 --> 16:55.567
- OH, MY GOD.

16:55.567 --> 16:56.834
WE MET IN BARCELONA.
- NICE.

16:56.834 --> 16:57.934
- A LONG TIME AGO.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.033
- I THINK NICO IS ADORABLE,
BUT HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND,

17:00.033 --> 17:01.934
AND I'M-I'M NOT GONNA
GET IN THE WAY OF THAT.

17:04.133 --> 17:05.467
- LISTEN,
YOU'RE BREAKING UP.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.567
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REALLY
THE MOST FAITHFUL PERSON.

17:07.567 --> 17:15.433
♪♪♪

17:15.433 --> 17:17.066
- NICO NEVER TALKS TO ME
ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND.

17:17.066 --> 17:18.166
HE NEVER BRINGS HER UP.

17:18.166 --> 17:21.266
I THINK A PART OF HIM
WANTS TO STAY AVAILABLE.

17:21.266 --> 17:22.800
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOIN',
RIGHT NOW, IS WRONG,

17:22.800 --> 17:23.867
BUT I DON'T CARE.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.100
I'M RIGHT WHERE
I WANNA BE.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.500
- OH, MY GOD,
WE'RE HOLDING HANDS.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.100
THAT'S SO OFFICIAL.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.967
- ARE YOU PLANNING TO
STAY HERE AFTER OUR SEASON?

17:30.967 --> 17:33.500
- NICO AND I TALKED ABOUT IT
FOR, LIKE, TWO NIGHTS,

17:33.500 --> 17:34.533
THREE DAYS.

17:34.533 --> 17:35.767
- BRI'S A REALLY
COOL CHICK,

17:35.767 --> 17:37.300
BUT TO GO THROUGH THIS
EXPERIENCE WITH HER,

17:37.300 --> 17:39.700
IT JUST MADE ME REALIZE
WHAT I HAD BEFORE.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.600
I LOVE MELISSA,
AND I WANNA GO BACK HOME

17:41.600 --> 17:43.667
AND FULLY COMMIT
TO HER.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.300
- OKAY, SO,

17:45.300 --> 17:48.266
DID YOU AND MELISSA
GET BACK TOGETHER AFTER?

17:48.266 --> 17:51.400
- UH, AFTER THE SEASON,
WE GOT TOGETHER FOR, UH,

17:51.400 --> 17:52.700
A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME,

17:52.700 --> 17:54.667
AND THINGS WEREN'T-
WEREN'T-WEREN'T WORKING. SO--

17:54.667 --> 17:57.000
- SO, HOW PISSED
WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND

17:57.000 --> 17:58.967
WHEN SHE SAW THE SHOW?

17:58.967 --> 18:01.533
- UH, I-I TOLD HER BEFORE,
UH, WHILE I WAS THERE,

18:01.533 --> 18:02.633
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

18:02.633 --> 18:04.734
AND, UH, WE SPOKE ABOUT IT
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.166
SO, OBVIOUSLY,
SHE WASN'T HAPPY.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.734
BUT, UM, YEAH, I MEAN,

18:08.734 --> 18:11.066
I OBVIOUSLY HANDLED IT
THE WRONG WAY,

18:11.066 --> 18:15.500
BUT I-I DON'T KNOW IF I DO
REGRET IT 100% BECAUSE I,

18:15.500 --> 18:18.667
YOU KNOW, NEEDED--
I GOT COMFORT FROM YOU,

18:18.667 --> 18:20.100
AND I CAN THANK YOU
FOR THAT, YOU KNOW,

18:20.100 --> 18:22.166
FOR SUPPORTING ME THROUGH
ALL THAT SH---Y TIME.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.333
- THANK YOU.
- BUT--

18:24.333 --> 18:27.200
- BUT SHE-- DID SHE BREAK UP
WITH YOU BEFORE THE SERIES

18:27.200 --> 18:29.567
STARTED AIRING OR AFTER?

18:29.567 --> 18:32.000
- UH, IT WAS DURING.
YEAH.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.367
- WHILE IT WAS AIRING.
- MM-HMM.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.767
- SO, SHE WAS PISSED BY
WHAT SHE WAS SEEING OF YOU.

18:35.767 --> 18:36.967
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

18:36.967 --> 18:39.233
- I MEAN, HEARING SOMETHING
AND THEN PHYSICALLY WATCH IT

18:39.233 --> 18:41.467
UNRAVEL IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES,
AND YOUR FAMILY DOES, TOO.

18:41.467 --> 18:42.767
- I CAN IMAGINE. YEAH.
- YEAH.

18:42.767 --> 18:45.066
- I-I THINK SHE HAD
EVERY RIGHT TO FEEL THAT WAY.

18:45.066 --> 18:46.900
- DID YOU FEEL THAT
HE WAS HONEST WITH YOU

18:46.900 --> 18:49.166
ABOUT THE STATE
OF HIS RELATIONSHIP?

18:49.166 --> 18:50.500
- NO.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.667
- I-I-I WAS 100%
HONEST WITH YOU.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.233
YOU EVEN CAME OUTSIDE
AND ASKED ME ABOUT--

18:54.233 --> 18:56.266
- NO, NO, NO, I KNEW--
I KNEW OF MELISSA.

18:56.266 --> 18:57.266
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.200
- BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS, LIKE,

18:58.200 --> 18:59.433
A YEAR LONG COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP.

18:59.433 --> 19:01.433
LIKE, I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST, LIKE, A FLING,

19:01.433 --> 19:05.233
BUT I SEE IT NOW, THAT HE WAS
STILL INVOLVED WITH HER.

19:05.233 --> 19:06.367
IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.700
- I WASN'T ENGAGED WITH HER
UNTIL THE END, OBVIOUSLY.

19:07.700 --> 19:08.734
- UNTIL THE END.
- YEAH.

19:08.734 --> 19:09.967
- AND THAT'S WHEN
OBVIOUSLY YOU FELT

19:09.967 --> 19:11.066
THAT I WAS PUSHING AWAY
FROM YOU.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.100
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.567
- BECAUSE IT'S THE
REALITY OF IT--

19:13.567 --> 19:16.166
OF CABIN FEVER AND
BEING AWAY FOR THAT TIME.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.200
- YEAH.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.500
- AND YOU WERE OBVIOUSLY
VERY COMFORTING FOR ME.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.467
- YEAH.

19:19.467 --> 19:21.400
IF I HAD MORE FEELINGS
INVESTED IN NICO,

19:21.400 --> 19:24.400
I THINK I WOULD
FOR SURE BE HURT, BUT--

19:24.400 --> 19:26.467
- THERE'S CLEARLY NOTHING
THAT WAS STILL HERE.

19:26.467 --> 19:27.734
- I DON'T THINK IT WAS--
IT WASN'T--

19:27.734 --> 19:29.300
- JUST--
- IT WAS MORE LIKE WE FELT
LIKE WE COULD BE THERE

19:29.300 --> 19:30.667
FOR EACH OTHER.
- IT WAS A BOAT-MANCE.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.166
- YEAH.
- UP NEXT...

19:32.166 --> 19:33.166
- YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.200

TO DEFEND ME.

21:29.033 --> 21:30.033
- YEAH, YEAH.

21:30.033 --> 21:32.100
- AND WE AGREED THAT
THAT WAS-- THIS IS IT.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.567
- YEAH, WHEN WE WENT
OFF TO THE HOTEL,

21:33.567 --> 21:36.066
WHERE EVERYTHING-- EVERYONE
ELSE THINKS WE HAD SEX,

21:36.066 --> 21:37.734
WE ACTUALLY TALKED,
LIKE, QUITE A WHILE

21:37.734 --> 21:38.967
AND GOT REALLY DEEP.

21:38.967 --> 21:41.300
EITHER WAY, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT HEARTBROKEN.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.500
- SHE'S IN LOVE.
- RIGHT.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.633
- WITH WHO?
- YEAH.
- BONDED.

21:44.633 --> 21:45.900
- WITH HER IRISH BOO.

21:45.900 --> 21:47.367
- AND YOU ARE SINGLE?

21:47.367 --> 21:48.767
- YES.
- OKAY.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.100
WELL, SINGLE MOM, JEN,

21:50.100 --> 21:51.867
JOINED THE CREW AS
A FIRST TIME STEW

21:51.867 --> 21:53.467
BECAUSE IT
WAS HER DREAM.

21:53.467 --> 21:54.934
BUT, BY THE END
OF THE SEASON,

21:54.934 --> 21:58.367
IT KINDA SEEMED LIKE EVERYONE
WANTED TO KICK HER AFT.

21:58.367 --> 21:59.767
[laughter]

21:59.767 --> 22:01.066
- YOU'RE MY OTHER
STEWARDESS, RIGHT?

22:01.066 --> 22:02.100
- YES.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.333
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
A CAREER IN YACHTING.

22:03.333 --> 22:06.033
I'M RARIN' AND READY TO GO.
GIVE ME THE IRON.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.133
UGH.

22:07.133 --> 22:08.800
- SHE SUCKS AT HER JOB,
BUT SHE'S HILARIOUS.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.867
[laughing]

22:10.867 --> 22:12.734
- YOU'RE EATING,
LIKE, A LONG TIME.

22:12.734 --> 22:14.734
- EXCUSE ME.
I DIDN'T GET A NAP.

22:14.734 --> 22:15.867
I WORKED MY--

22:15.867 --> 22:17.200
ACTUALLY, LONGER
THAN ALL OF YOU.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.767
- YOU'RE QUITE BITTER
ALL THE TIME.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.133
- WHAT THE ----
DID YOU JUST SAY?

22:24.133 --> 22:25.100
- YOU CAN'T JUST-- YOU--

22:25.100 --> 22:25.934
- I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE MISERABLE.

22:25.934 --> 22:26.934
WANT TO HELP--

22:26.934 --> 22:28.667
- WELL, YOU SEEM VERY
OUT OF LINE RIGHT NOW.

22:28.667 --> 22:29.800
- NO, THIS IS A
FRIEND TO A FRIEND.

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
YOU SAID YOU
WANTED TO CONTINUE.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.867
- YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND.
- SICK OF EVERYONE.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.467
- CHECK YOU LATER.
- YEAH, WHATEVER!

22:33.467 --> 22:34.900
- YOU'RE A (BLEEP) IDIOT.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.033
- WHATEVER, WHORE.

22:36.033 --> 22:37.200
- I'M GONNA LOCK YOU
IN A BATHROOM,

22:37.200 --> 22:38.600
IF YOU'RE STILL
SCREAMING AT ME.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.533
(BLEEP) YOU, YOU WILL NEVER
LOCK ME IN A BATHROOM.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.166
GET YOUR (BLEEP)--
- GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

22:42.166 --> 22:43.233
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

22:43.233 --> 22:44.667
- I DON'T WANNA HEAR
YOUR VOICE RIGHT NOW.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.633
- THEN WHY ARE YOU HAVING
A CONVERSATION WITH ME?

22:46.633 --> 22:50.533
- THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION.
THIS IS A LECTURE.

22:50.533 --> 22:51.934
[chuckling]

22:51.934 --> 22:53.133
- OKAY.

22:53.133 --> 22:56.100
UM, JEN,
PATRICK, FROM D.C., SAID,

22:56.100 --> 22:58.900
"YOU-YOU CONTINUALLY
COMPLAINED ABOUT

22:58.900 --> 23:01.066
"HOW THE LAUNDRY AND
CLEANING NEVER END.

23:01.066 --> 23:03.000
"WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE SIGNING UP FOR?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.734
"THAT IS LITERALLY
YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION."

23:05.734 --> 23:07.467
- THERE WERE MOMENTS
WHERE I COMPLAINED, YES.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.233
BUT I FEEL THAT...
- MOMENTS?

23:09.233 --> 23:12.533
- I'M VERY VERBAL,
AND I-I FEEL THAT,

23:12.533 --> 23:13.967
SOMETIMES COMMUNICATION
IS THE BEST WAY

23:13.967 --> 23:17.767
TO RESOLVE ISSUES
THAT ARE CURRENTLY...

23:17.767 --> 23:18.867
GOING ON.

23:18.867 --> 23:20.567
- KATE, CASEY, FROM
LAWRENCE, KANSAS, SAID,

23:20.567 --> 23:23.633
"IS THIS THE WORST INTERIOR
CREW YOU'VE WORKED WITH?

23:23.633 --> 23:26.266
"DO YOU THINK YOU COULD'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR FIRST TIME

23:26.266 --> 23:29.367
"AS A THIRD STEW AND BEEN
A LITTLE NICER TO JEN?"

23:29.367 --> 23:31.700
- I DID THINK ABOUT MY
FIRST TIME AS A THIRD STEW,

23:31.700 --> 23:33.667
AND THAT'S WHY JEN WAS
THERE THE WHOLE SEASON.

23:33.667 --> 23:36.333
UM, UNTIL YOU'VE WORKED
ON A CHARTER YACHT,

23:36.333 --> 23:38.934
YOU CANNOT COMPREHEND
THE AMOUNT OF WORK.

23:38.934 --> 23:41.200
YOU THINK YOU KNOW, BUT YOU
DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU'RE THERE,

23:41.200 --> 23:42.934
AND YOU'RE--
YOU JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

23:42.934 --> 23:46.200
UM, AND, NO, IT WAS NOT
MY WORST INTERIOR CREW.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.767
I ACTUALLY ENJOYED WORKING
WITH BOTH BRI AND JEN.

23:48.767 --> 23:50.433
- THANKS.
- I WOULD SAY THAT...

23:50.433 --> 23:52.900
"EROS" WAS MY MOST
DIFFICULT SEASON.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.700
- THIS WAS THE ROCKY SEASON?
- ROCKY, YEAH.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.400
IT WAS--
- LOVED ROCKY.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.667
- BECAUSE JEN HAS
GOOD MOMENTS,

23:57.667 --> 23:59.033
SHE MAKES ME LAUGH,
AND WE'RE FRIENDS.

23:59.033 --> 24:02.133
ROCKY WAS, LIKE...
NOT GOOD.

24:02.133 --> 24:03.166
- RIGHT.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.633
- LAURIE, FROM, UH,
VERMONT, SAID,

24:04.633 --> 24:06.300
"KATE, DO YOU REALLY THINK,
AS A MANAGER,

24:06.300 --> 24:08.367
"IT'S APPROPRIATE
TO SAY TO A GUEST,

24:08.367 --> 24:10.667
"'SHE SUCKS AT HER JOB,
BUT SHE'S FUNNY'?

24:10.667 --> 24:12.600
"WAY TO MOTIVATE
AND BUILD A TEAM.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.166
"NOT."

24:14.166 --> 24:15.400
- I DON'T THINK IT WAS
APPROPRIATE AT ALL,

24:15.400 --> 24:16.667
AND I APOLOGIZE.
- THANK YOU.

24:16.667 --> 24:17.767
- I'M SURE THAT
WAS EMBARRASSING

24:17.767 --> 24:18.934
AND DISHEARTENING.

24:18.934 --> 24:20.433
UM, THESE GUESTS WERE--

24:20.433 --> 24:23.467
I TRY TO CATER TO EACH
GUEST GROUP PERSONALITY,

24:23.467 --> 24:25.800
AND THEY WERE SASSY,
AND IT WASN'T RIGHT--

24:25.800 --> 24:27.333
- I THINK THEY LIKED IT,
ACTUALLY, THAT GROUP.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.900
- THEY DID.
THEY DID AND--

24:28.900 --> 24:30.934
BUT IT STILL--
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OKAY.

24:30.934 --> 24:33.033
UM, AND I-- BUT I DON'T
THINK I WOULD'VE DONE THAT

24:33.033 --> 24:35.200
WITH ANY OTHER CHARTER GROUP
THAT WE HAD ONBOARD.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.033
- CAN I SAY SOMETHING REALLY
QUICK ON THAT SUBJECT?

24:39.033 --> 24:41.100
WE ACTUALLY HAD
A BANTER GOING ON

24:41.100 --> 24:43.233
THAT WE-WE WERE BOTH VERY
SARCASTIC WITH EACH OTHER,

24:43.233 --> 24:45.433
AND WITTY, BUT IT WAS,
LIKE, VERY JOVIAL.

24:45.433 --> 24:48.800
IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE BECAUSE
THERE'S A VERY THIN LINE

24:48.800 --> 24:51.800
WHERE YOU'RE JOKING ONE SECOND,
AND THE NEXT SECOND,

24:51.800 --> 24:53.166
YOU'RE INSULTING
ONE ANOTHER.

24:53.166 --> 24:55.367
AND I DEFINITELY
APOLOGIZE AS WELL,

24:55.367 --> 24:57.900
FOR BEING OUT OF LINE,
BECAUSE YOU WERE MY BOSS.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.266
- I AM KIND OF
A BITCH SOMETIMES.

24:59.266 --> 25:00.400
IT'S FINE.
- DID YOU SAY, "BITCH"?

25:00.400 --> 25:01.633
- I SAID, "LOOK WHAT YOU DID,
YOU LITTLE BITCH."

25:01.633 --> 25:02.834
- OKAY, GOT IT.
I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.033
- I DIDN'T CALL HER A BITCH.
- I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT.

25:04.033 --> 25:05.133
- NO.
- OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

25:05.133 --> 25:07.166
- CAPTAIN LEE,
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF JEN,

25:07.166 --> 25:08.633
AND HER WORK ETHIC,

25:08.633 --> 25:13.200
AND HER RESPECT OR
DISRESPECT FOR KATE?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.300
- AFTER VIEWING IT?

25:15.300 --> 25:18.133
- YEAH, TELL ME WHAT YOU
THOUGHT OF IT ON THE BOAT,

25:18.133 --> 25:19.200
AND THEN AFTER
VIEWING IT.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.867
- ON THE BOAT,
I WASN'T PRIVY TO IT.

25:20.867 --> 25:21.900
- OKAY.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.000
WHAT DID YOU THINK
AFTER VIEWING IT?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.500
- KATE-KATE NEVER CAME TO ME
WITH ANYTHING ABOUT JEN.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.467
- OKAY.
- NOT A GOOD WORD.

25:26.467 --> 25:28.000
NOT A BAD WORD.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.066
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
FLATLINE.

25:30.066 --> 25:35.100
UH, AFTER I SAW IT, UH,
HAD I KNOWN ABOUT IT,

25:35.100 --> 25:37.166
THERE WERE A COUPLE
OF INSTANCES THAT,

25:37.166 --> 25:40.433
HAD I BEEN PRIVY
TO IT AND SEEN IT,

25:40.433 --> 25:43.934
I WOULD'VE PULLED JEN
UP INTO THE WHEELHOUSE.

25:43.934 --> 25:47.967
I WOULD'VE HAD
A WITNESS THERE

25:47.967 --> 25:50.333
AND TOLD HER
EXACTLY WHAT I FELT.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.400
- KYLE--

25:51.400 --> 25:52.533
- AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES
WERE GOING TO BE.

25:52.533 --> 25:54.700
- AND I RESPECT THAT.
I WOULD EXPECT THAT, AS WELL.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.867
I-I WOULD APPRECIATE IT,
ACTUALLY.

25:56.867 --> 25:59.333
- KYLE, WHY ARE YOU
SO SALTY WITH HER?

25:59.333 --> 26:00.400
- IT'S NOT THAT.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.333
IT'S THE FACT THAT
YOU (BLEEP) SAID IT.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.867
YOU SAID THOSE WORDS.

26:03.867 --> 26:06.100
DON'T SAY IT WAS JOVIAL.
WE ALL SAW IT AS WHAT IT IS.

26:06.100 --> 26:07.300
- IT WAS-IT WAS A JOKE.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.367
YOU WEREN'T THERE.
- YOU WEREN'T THERE, KYLE.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.533
- IT WASN'T THAT WAY.
I SEEN IT.

26:09.533 --> 26:10.567
BUT HANG ON FOR A MINUTE.
- YOU CAME FOR THE LAST WEEK.

26:10.567 --> 26:12.133
- WERE YOU THERE WHEN
I SAT AT A (BLEEP) TABLE,

26:12.133 --> 26:14.033
AND SHE SLAGGED YOU OFF
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF?

26:14.033 --> 26:15.467
AND I SAT THERE
AND DEFENDED YOU,

26:15.467 --> 26:16.567
AND HE WAS THERE,

26:16.567 --> 26:17.633
SHE WAS THERE.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:17.633 --> 26:19.433
- AND SHE WAS THERE WHEN
YOU WERE SLAGGING HER OFF

26:19.433 --> 26:21.166
TO ALL HIGH HELL.
- LET HER VENT.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.567
SHE WAS THERE ALL SEASON.
YOU'D BEEN THERE A DAY.

26:22.567 --> 26:23.834
- I DON'T GIVE A SH--
[indistinct].

26:23.834 --> 26:25.367
- WE WEREN'T EVEN THERE
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.

26:25.367 --> 26:26.567
- I JUST COME OFF A (BLEEP)
BOAT FOR TWO MONTHS,

26:26.567 --> 26:28.200
IN THE ARTIC, FREEZING
MY (BLEEP) BULLOCKS OFF.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.433
- NOT THIS BOAT.
- NO, JEN,

26:29.433 --> 26:31.367
CAUSE YOU TALK SH--, LOVE.
- YOU'RE VERY ANGRY.

26:31.367 --> 26:32.767
- YOU'RE TALKING
ABSOLUTE SH--.

26:32.767 --> 26:33.834
- OKAY, SO DO YOU.

26:33.834 --> 26:34.900
- I CAN DEFEND
MYSELF WITH JEN.

26:34.900 --> 26:36.266
- NO WORRIES,
BUT YOU'RE FRIEND.

26:36.266 --> 26:38.000
- BRI, KAITLIN, FROM
MADISON, WISCONSIN, SAID,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.834
"OVERALL, DO YOU THINK
KATE WAS TOO HARD ON JEN?"

26:41.834 --> 26:44.100
- UH, MAYBE IF
IT WAS THE SAME WAY

26:44.100 --> 26:46.700
TOWARDS ANOTHER STEWARDESS,
BUT THEY HAD THIS, LIKE,

26:46.700 --> 26:50.233
MUTUAL THING THAT I
COULDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.400
- NO, IT'S TRUE.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.533
- THEY WERE, LIKE,
KINDA HARD ON EACH OTHER.

26:52.533 --> 26:53.800
LIKE, IT'S--

26:53.800 --> 26:55.333
SO, NO, I DON'T THINK
SHE WAS TOO HARD.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.200
- BEING IN THE GALLEY AND
LISTENING TO, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

26:57.200 --> 26:59.000
ALL THE STEWS
TALK AND BANTER,

26:59.000 --> 27:00.834
THESE TWO WERE ACTUALLY
HAVING SO MUCH FUN

27:00.834 --> 27:02.000
DURING THE SEASON.
- YEAH.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.066
- THEY-THEY WERE.

27:03.066 --> 27:04.567
AND I-- BEING THE EARS
OF THE GALLEY, OBVIOUSLY.

27:04.567 --> 27:05.700
- YEAH.
- IT'S QUITE CONFUSING.

27:05.700 --> 27:06.567
I JUST KINDA
STAYED BACK.

27:06.567 --> 27:07.767
- I THINK IT WAS
CONFUSING FOR US, TOO.

27:07.767 --> 27:09.600
- BRI, HOW DID YOU
LIKE WORKING WITH JEN?

27:09.600 --> 27:10.967
- IT'S (BLEEP) HARD.

27:10.967 --> 27:13.433
UM, BUT I-BUT I DID
GET A LOTTA LAUGHS.

27:13.433 --> 27:14.667
I DID.

27:14.667 --> 27:15.800
- COMING UP...

27:15.800 --> 27:17.734
- TALK ABOUT MANNERS.
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE NONE, SIR.

27:17.734 --> 27:19.033
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE
A (BLEEP) LIAR.

27:19.033 --> 27:22.333
♪♪♪

27:27.934 --> 27:28.333
- OKAY, WE ARE BACK,

27:28.333 --> 27:28.834
- OKAY, WE ARE BACK,
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JEN.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.834
UH, BROOKE, FROM VERO BEACH,
FLORIDA, SAID, UH,

27:33.834 --> 27:37.767
"JEN, THAT WHOLE WHORING AROUND
JOKE SPUN OUT OF CONTROL."

27:37.767 --> 27:39.266
- I AGREE.
- "DID KATE TAKE IT TOO FAR?

27:39.266 --> 27:42.333
"WERE YOU SHOCKED THAT SHE
SPUN THE BLAME AROUND ON YOU?"

27:42.333 --> 27:43.633
- I AGREE, ABSOLUTELY,

27:43.633 --> 27:45.900
THAT IT DEFINITELY
ESCALATED VERY QUICKLY,

27:45.900 --> 27:47.500
AND I APOLOGIZE.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.500
I THINK, IN THE MOMENT--

27:48.500 --> 27:49.500
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO BRING
YOUR DAUGHTER INTO IT.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.033
I WAS JUST
TALKING ABOUT MATH.

27:51.033 --> 27:53.100
LIKE, IT WAS JUST
A DEFENSIVE CLAP BACK,

27:53.100 --> 27:54.333
AND YOU KNOW I--
- AND I ASSUMED.

27:54.333 --> 27:56.000
IT JUST HIT A
SOFT SPOT WITHIN ME.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.166
- OF COURSE, IT DID.
OF COURSE, IT DID.

27:57.166 --> 27:58.367
- AND SO, I FELT THE
NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.

27:58.367 --> 28:01.367
I TRIED TO DO IT, AND,
YOU KNOW, PULL HER ASIDE,

28:01.367 --> 28:02.700
NOT IN FRONT OF
EVERYBODY ELSE,

28:02.700 --> 28:04.800
TO TRY AND MAKE
IT AS PROFESSIONAL

28:04.800 --> 28:06.200
OF A SITUATION
AS I COULD,

28:06.200 --> 28:08.967
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A VERY
UNPROFESSIONAL SITUATION.

28:08.967 --> 28:10.834
- JEN, MELISSA FROM
HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT, SAID,

28:10.834 --> 28:13.400
"YOU JOKED ABOUT
KATE WHORING AROUND,

28:13.400 --> 28:15.533
"AND LATER CALLED
BAKER A WHORE.

28:15.533 --> 28:18.066

TO STOOP TO THAT LEVEL

28:20.100 --> 28:21.667
"AND NOT ANYONE ELSE?"

28:21.667 --> 28:23.734
- I-- BAKER IS
ANYTHING BUT A WHORE,

28:23.734 --> 28:25.734
AND I APOLOGIZED
TO HER THE NEXT DAY,

28:25.734 --> 28:27.600
AND I-I WILL SAY
THAT, YOU KNOW,

28:27.600 --> 28:28.900
YOU THREW A NAME FIRST.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.533
NOT THAT IT'S RIGHT THAT
I CALLED A NAME BACK,

28:30.533 --> 28:32.367
BUT I WAS INEBRIATED.

28:32.367 --> 28:33.667
I HAD NO PLACE BEING--

28:33.667 --> 28:35.867
- DID YOU TAKE IN HER
APOLOGY THE NEXT DAY?

28:35.867 --> 28:37.900
- YEAH, NO, I MEAN,
THAT KINDA STUFF,

28:37.900 --> 28:40.233
IT'S-IT'S NOT TO
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

28:40.233 --> 28:42.333
IT'S JUST END OF THE NIGHT--

28:42.333 --> 28:45.133
I WOULDN'T CALL IT BANTER,
BUT, YOU KNOW, YEAH.

28:45.133 --> 28:46.700
- AARON, FROM ROCHESTER,
NEW YORK, SAID,

28:46.700 --> 28:48.967
"JEN, YOU BECAME ANOTHER
PERSON WHEN DRUNK.

28:48.967 --> 28:51.066
"WAS IT BECAUSE OF
THE STRESS OF THE JOB,

28:51.066 --> 28:52.367
"WERE YOU MISSING
YOUR DAUGHTER,

28:52.367 --> 28:53.567
"OR WHAT WAS IT?"

28:53.567 --> 28:55.867
- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

28:55.867 --> 28:57.100
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
HARD TO WATCH.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.834
IT'S NOT WHO I AM.

28:58.834 --> 29:00.667
I DON'T NORMALLY
DRINK LIKE THAT.

29:00.667 --> 29:02.533
I USUALLY
BARELY EVEN DRINK.

29:02.533 --> 29:05.000
IF I DO, IT'S CHAMPAGNE,
LIKE, ON THE WEEKEND.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.333
MAYBE EVEN
EVERY OTHER WEEKEND.

29:06.333 --> 29:09.700
- KYLE, YOUR REACTION TO JEN
TAKING A BITE OF YOUR FOOD

29:09.700 --> 29:11.600
WAS...

29:11.600 --> 29:13.133
- INTENSE.
- INTENSE.

29:13.133 --> 29:14.266
- HE KNOWS THE RULES.
- I HAVE TO SAY...

29:14.266 --> 29:15.567
- HE KNOWS THE RULES.
- I PULLED THAT FORK OUT

29:15.567 --> 29:16.567
OF THE SILVERWARE ROLL.

29:16.567 --> 29:17.433
I DIDN'T-I DIDN'T
LICK IT BEFORE.

29:17.433 --> 29:18.333
- I DO.
I JUST FIND IT VERY ODD.

29:18.333 --> 29:19.233

CALLED MANNERS.

29:19.233 --> 29:20.667
THIS WOMAN HAS NONE.

29:20.667 --> 29:21.633
- REALLY?
- END OF.

29:21.633 --> 29:23.667
- YOU'RE GONNA SAY
THAT ONE ACTION,

29:23.667 --> 29:25.066
BLANKET STATEMENT,
I HAVE NO MANNERS.

29:25.066 --> 29:26.567
- YOU HAVE NO MANNERS.
- IT WAS A CLEAN FORK.

29:26.567 --> 29:28.066
- YOU-- LISTEN,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.800
- OH, IT DOESN'T?
- YOU ASK BEFORE YOU DO IT.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.266
- UH, FAIR ENOUGH.
- YOU GO, "OH, OH.

29:31.266 --> 29:32.467
"DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME GET"-- SORRY.

29:32.467 --> 29:33.767
THIS IS A BIT OF
A THING WITH ME,

29:33.767 --> 29:35.333
- CLEARLY.
- NOW, IT MIGHT BE MY THING.

29:35.333 --> 29:36.433
BUT IN MY FAMILY--
- I DIDN'T KNOW,

29:36.433 --> 29:37.567
AND I APOLOGIZE.

29:37.567 --> 29:38.800
- IT WAS JUST VERY,
LIKE, DRAMATIC.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.934
- IT WAS A LITTLE DRAMATIC.
- YOU DO THIS EVERY TIME

29:39.934 --> 29:41.000
WHEN, LIKE,

29:41.000 --> 29:42.300
I'M NOT TOUCHING THIS
WHOLE ENTIRE PLATE.

29:42.300 --> 29:43.367
- BEFORE SHE
TOOK YOUR FOOD,

29:43.367 --> 29:44.767
WAS THERE A MOMENT
WHEN YOU THOUGHT

29:44.767 --> 29:46.233
MAYBE THE
TWO OF YOU--

29:46.233 --> 29:47.633
SOMETHING WAS GONNA
HAPPEN BETWEEN THE TWO--

29:47.633 --> 29:48.734
- I DON'T KNOW, REALLY.

29:48.734 --> 29:49.934
THE FACT IS, YOU KNOW,

29:49.934 --> 29:52.400
I-I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH
A LOT OF MEN ON [indistinct]

29:52.400 --> 29:53.834
UP IN THE ARTIC CIRCLE.
- UH-HUH.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.734
- SO, WHEN I SEE
AN ATTRACTIVE LADY,

29:55.734 --> 29:57.233
I'M GOING STRAIGHT
IN FOR IT.

29:57.233 --> 29:59.633
- WHEN YOU'RE ON THOSE FISHING
BOATS WITH ALL THOSE GUYS...

29:59.633 --> 30:00.800
- YEAH.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.066
- ... DOES IT BECOME KIND OF
A HOLE IS A HOLE MENTALITY

30:03.066 --> 30:04.133
UP THERE?
- LIKE JAIL?

30:04.133 --> 30:05.767
- I'VE SEEN SOME VERY,
VERY STRANGE THINGS.

30:05.767 --> 30:07.700
BUT THE FACT WAS,
SHE WAS AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.166
I COULD SEE SHE WAS HAVING
A BIT OF A HARD TIME.

30:09.166 --> 30:10.200
I WAS LIKE,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:10.200 --> 30:11.800
EVEN IF NOTHING HAPPENED,

30:11.800 --> 30:13.433
LET'S GO OUT AND
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

30:13.433 --> 30:14.900
THAT'S ALL I
REALLY WANTED TO DO.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.367
AND SO, IT HAPPENED, AND WE--
- AND THEN SHE TOOK THE BITE,

30:17.367 --> 30:18.967
AND THAT WAS IT FOR YOU.
- SHE ----ED UP.

30:18.967 --> 30:20.200
SHE'S DEAD TO ME NOW.
- WOW.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.266
- NO, BUT-BUT--
OKAY, I CAN'T.

30:21.266 --> 30:23.367
- JEN, UH, MARIAH,
FROM PHOENIX,

30:23.367 --> 30:26.033
WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU
REALLY THINK EVERYONE
LOOKED DOWN ON YOU.

30:26.033 --> 30:30.500
- I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THE
CREW FORGOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

30:30.500 --> 30:32.433
THE MOMENTS WHERE
THEY WERE FIRST GREEN,

30:32.433 --> 30:35.066
AND I JUST--
I THINK THAT...

30:35.066 --> 30:37.500
[sighs]
I DEFINITELY AM NOT PLAYING
THE VICTIM BY ANY MEANS.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.633
I DEFINITELY AM
FULLY AWARE OF THE FACT

30:40.633 --> 30:42.266
THAT I CAN BE A LOT
TO HANDLE AT TIMES.

30:42.266 --> 30:43.600
[laughing]
DO YOU NEED TO EXCUSE
YOURSELF FOR A SECOND?

30:43.600 --> 30:44.934
- NO, I'M LAUGHING AT--
I'M LAUGHING AT LEE.

30:44.934 --> 30:46.967
- TALK ABOUT MANNERS.
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE NONE, SIR.

30:46.967 --> 30:48.000
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE
A (BLEEP) LIAR.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.567
- DID SHE PLAY THE VICTIM?
- EASY.

30:49.567 --> 30:50.867
- I'M A LIAR?
WHAT AM I LYING ABOUT?

30:50.867 --> 30:52.600
- I THINK THAT,
ON YOUR FIRST YACHT,

30:52.600 --> 30:54.567
IT'S EASY TO THINK THAT
YOU'RE DOING THE MOST WORK.

30:54.567 --> 30:56.200
I CERTAINLY FELT
THE SAME WAY.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.533
I WAS SIMILAR TO JEN
ON MY FIRST YACHT.

30:58.533 --> 30:59.767
- OH, JESUS.
- GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

30:59.767 --> 31:01.133
- BRI, BAILEY
FROM SAN JOSE SAID,

31:01.133 --> 31:02.600
"YOU WERE PROMOTED
AT THE END OF THE SEASON.

31:02.600 --> 31:06.333
"HAD THAT BEEN SOMETHING
YOU WERE WORKING TOWARDS?"

31:06.333 --> 31:08.700
- I DEFINITELY APPRECIATED IT,
ESPECIALLY COMING FROM KATE.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.300
UM, BUT, I MEAN, PERSONALLY,
I THOUGHT I CAME ON THE BOAT

31:12.300 --> 31:13.867
A SECOND STEW.

31:13.867 --> 31:16.066
- JEN, DID SHE DESERVE IT?

31:16.066 --> 31:19.567
- YEAH, I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA
RAIN ON SOMEONE'S PARADE.

31:19.567 --> 31:20.767
BRI WORKED HARD.

31:20.767 --> 31:24.467
SHE'S BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY
OBVIOUSLY LONGER THAN I HAVE,

31:24.467 --> 31:28.166
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE
DESERVE TO BE REWARDED

31:28.166 --> 31:29.633
FOR HARD WORK.

31:29.633 --> 31:32.000
- EJ, MARGE FROM TUCSON SAID,
"DO YOU THINK KATE

31:32.000 --> 31:33.667
"AND THE STEWS
DID A GOOD JOB?

31:33.667 --> 31:36.100
"WAS KATE
A GOOD CHIEF STEW?"

31:36.100 --> 31:38.800
- I THINK, UH, KATE
HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE,

31:38.800 --> 31:40.400
AND SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.900
THE REST OF THE CREW--
THE REST OF THE GIRLS,

31:41.900 --> 31:44.600
THEY'RE NOT AS
WELL-VERSED IN, YOU KNOW,

31:44.600 --> 31:47.700
DIFFERENT YACHTS
AND HOW THE COMMON GROUND,

31:47.700 --> 31:50.734
THE FORMULA THAT,
UH, STEWS WOULD OPERATE ON.

ARE COMIN' IN, YOU KNOW,

31:56.967 --> 31:58.333
I HAVE MORE THAN
VERY LITTLE. SORRY.

- WELL-- AND SHE'S TRYING
TO WORK WITH WHAT SHE GOT.

ARE FALLIN' A LITTLE APART.

32:02.467 --> 32:03.834
THEY'RE GOING
IN A LITTLE DISARRAY,

32:03.834 --> 32:06.000
BUT I THINK SHE KINDA
PIECED IT TOGETHER

32:06.000 --> 32:08.066
AND GOT IT THROUGH
THE SEASON, YOU KNOW?

32:08.066 --> 32:10.900
- KATE AND JEN, CHELSEA FROM
OKLAHOMA CITY WANTS TO KNOW

32:10.900 --> 32:14.767
WHERE YOU TWO STAND NOW AND
IF YOU WOULD TOGETHER, AGAIN.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.033

HARDER THAN JEN,

32:17.033 --> 32:18.633
AND I THINK,
IN YACHTING,

32:18.633 --> 32:20.700
THAT'S A VALUABLE
ASSET, AS WELL,

32:20.700 --> 32:23.767
BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING
LONG DAYS IN CLOSE QUARTERS.

32:23.767 --> 32:26.767

UM, AND WE ARE FRIENDS,
GOOD FRIENDS.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.433
- AGREED, YEAH.
- SO, YOU WOULD WORK WITH HER.

32:31.433 --> 32:34.700
- YES. I'M NOT SURE IF I WOULD
WORK WITH HER IN YACHTING.

SHE'S A PLEASURE TO BE AROUND.

HOW TO WORK A KEURIG.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.800
- I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE
THAT MATT COULD PROBABLY

35:33.800 --> 35:35.600
COME UP WITH THE MENU
ALL ON HIS OWN.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.967
WHY IS MATT DEPENDING
ON BRUNO FOR IDEAS?

35:37.967 --> 35:39.233
HE'S A ----ING DECKHAND.

35:39.233 --> 35:40.867
- UM, HAVE YOU
TRIED THE SCALLOPS?

35:40.867 --> 35:41.834
THEY'RE GUMMY.

35:41.834 --> 35:43.166
- I NEED TO PUT
MY PERSONAL SH-- ASIDE

35:43.166 --> 35:44.367
AND FOCUS ON THE MEAL.

35:44.367 --> 35:45.900
- MATT'S FINALLY DECIDED TO
STEP UP THIS GAME

35:45.900 --> 35:47.333
IN THE LAST CHARTER.

35:47.333 --> 35:48.333
THANK YOU.

35:48.333 --> 35:49.500
- GO. PEPPER.
- YAY.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.600
- THAT LOOKS GREAT, MAN.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.066
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GETTIN'
READY FOR FOAM HERE.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.533
- IT'S VERY GOOD.
- TASTES GREAT.

35:53.533 --> 35:57.033
- THEY'RE LOVING IT.
- I'M LEAVING A BETTER CHEF.

35:58.266 --> 36:00.166
- MATT, LOOKED LIKE
A ROUGH SEASON FOR YOU.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.200
- IT WAS REALLY ROUGH.
- WHY WAS IT SO ROUGH?

36:02.200 --> 36:04.600
- I HAD SOME PERSONAL THINGS
HAPPENING BACK HOME,

36:04.600 --> 36:06.300
AND I BROUGHT THAT
TO THE WORKPLACE.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.900
SO, YOU KNOW,
I WISH I DIDN'T.

36:08.900 --> 36:09.967
I WISH I HADN'T.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.533
- LAURIE FROM ARLINGTON,
VIRGINIA WANTS TO KNOW,

36:11.533 --> 36:15.233
"KATE, HAVE YOU MISSED BEN
THIS SEASON IN THE KITCHEN."

36:15.233 --> 36:17.133
- BEN AND I HAVE
A VERY GOOD BANTER.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.834
UH, HE MAKES ME LAUGH,
AND, OBVIOUSLY,

36:18.834 --> 36:21.233
THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN
YOU'RE WORKING ON A BOAT,

36:21.233 --> 36:24.834
UM, BUT IT'S ALSO NICE TO HAVE
A BREAK FROM HIS INTENSITY,

36:24.834 --> 36:26.533
AND I ENJOYED
WORKING WITH MATT.

36:26.533 --> 36:28.033
- GLORIA R. WANTS TO KNOW

36:28.033 --> 36:30.834
WHY THE CHEF DOESN'T
HAVE A SOUS CHEF.

36:30.834 --> 36:32.967
SEEMS TO HER LIKE
HE NEEDS ONE.

36:32.967 --> 36:34.200
- HE DID.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.500
- I DID.
I HAD A GREAT SOUS CHEF.

36:35.500 --> 36:40.200
- BRUNO, BUT BRUNO
IS A DECKHAND.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.033
I MEAN--
[laughing]

36:41.033 --> 36:41.967
- BUT, YOU SEE,
YOU CAN'T JUST--

36:41.967 --> 36:43.133
HE'S LABELED A DECKHAND,

36:43.133 --> 36:45.166
BUT HE CAN ALSO DO
OTHER THINGS LIKE--

36:45.166 --> 36:46.700
- BRUNO DOESN'T LIKE LABELS.
- HE DOESN'T.

36:46.700 --> 36:48.100
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
SAY THE SAME THING.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.800
- HE DOESN'T LIKE LABELS.
- AM I DECKHAND?

36:49.800 --> 36:52.834
AM I A SOUS CHEF?
HE'S WHEREVER HE IS.

36:52.834 --> 36:53.734
- STEWARDESS.

36:53.734 --> 36:54.734
- HE WAS THE,
UH, UTILITY TOOL.

36:54.734 --> 36:55.767
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

36:55.767 --> 36:57.066
- I AGREE.
- HE'S A FLUID GUY, ANDY.

36:57.066 --> 36:58.800
- BRU KNOWS.
BRU KNOWS IT ALL.

36:58.800 --> 37:02.333
- BRUNO, WHY DID YOU COME IN
AND HELP MATT SO MUCH?

37:04.500 --> 37:08.633
- UM, WELL, IT IS
AN AREA THAT I LOVE.

37:08.633 --> 37:11.700
I MEAN, COOKING IS SOMETHING
THAT I DO EVERY SINGLE DAY.

37:11.700 --> 37:16.567
SO, WHEN I LOOKED TO MATT,
AND I REALLY SAW, LIKE,

37:16.567 --> 37:20.100
HE NEEDED HELP BESIDES
JUST ME CLEANING HIS DISHES,

37:20.100 --> 37:22.200
I WAS LIKE, YEAH, SURE.
WHY NOT?

37:22.200 --> 37:24.166
I'M JUST GONNA GIVE YOU
HELP WITH THAT,

37:24.166 --> 37:26.333
AND-AND I THINK
IT WORKED REALLY WELL.

37:26.333 --> 37:27.900
I MEAN, HE IS
A GREAT LISTENER,

37:27.900 --> 37:31.433
AND HE'S WILLING TO
LET SOMEONE HELP HIM,

37:31.433 --> 37:33.266
AND THAT WAS GREAT.

37:33.266 --> 37:35.533
- UM, LIZ FROM OMAHA,
NEBRASKA SAID,

37:35.533 --> 37:38.400
"MATT, UH, YOU REALLY STEPPED IT
UP IN THE LAST CHARTER.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.500
"DO YOU THINK YOU'D HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO PREPARE THAT MEAL

37:40.500 --> 37:42.667
"WITHOUT KATE'S DIRECTION?"

37:42.667 --> 37:44.300
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.300
- WOW.
- NO.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.500
KATE HELPED ME THROUGHOUT
THE WHOLE SEASON

37:47.500 --> 37:49.533
AND WITH EVERY SINGLE PLATE

37:49.533 --> 37:51.200
'CAUSE, IN THE GALLEY,

37:51.200 --> 37:53.633
YOU CAN'T SEE SOME OF
THE REACTIONS OF THE GUESTS,

37:53.633 --> 37:54.734
YOU KNOW?

37:54.734 --> 37:57.033
SO, THE LAST POW WOW
WE HAD WAS GREAT.

37:57.033 --> 38:00.066
I LOVED IT, AND IT SHOWED
HOW MUCH OF A TEAM PLAYER

38:00.066 --> 38:01.633
SHE IS TO HELP ME.

38:01.633 --> 38:03.700
- BRUNO, WHY ARE YOU
LAUGHING?

38:03.700 --> 38:05.934
- BECAUSE IT WAS GREAT,
HER REACTION,

38:05.934 --> 38:09.166
WHEN SHE ACTUALLY HELPED
YOU THE LAST CHARTER,

38:09.166 --> 38:13.500
BUT THE ENTIRE SEASON,
THE ONLY THING I SAW

38:13.500 --> 38:16.633
AFTERWARDS,
AFTER LEAVING "VALOR,"

38:16.633 --> 38:19.133
IT WAS JUST CRITICISM,

38:19.133 --> 38:22.433
AND I DIDN'T SEE HER
ACTUALLY SITTING WITH YOU

38:22.433 --> 38:24.433
LIKE SHE DID
ON THE CHARTER,

38:24.433 --> 38:26.266
THE PREVIOUS CHARTERS,
AND HELPING YOU.

38:26.266 --> 38:29.166
I MEAN, SHE EVEN SAID
THAT YOUR BANANA FOSTER

38:29.166 --> 38:30.500
WAS LIKE A SEAGULL'S SH--.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.400
SO, I-I REALLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.667
- IT WAS.
NO OFFENSE, IT WAS.

38:33.667 --> 38:35.433
- CRITICISMS--
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM,

38:35.433 --> 38:36.767
AND IT DID LOOK
LIKE SH--.

38:36.767 --> 38:39.233
[laughing]
- WELL, KATE, WAS
BRUNO ACTUALLY HELPFUL

38:39.233 --> 38:41.867
IN THE GALLEY,
OR WAS HE A KNOW IT ALL?

38:41.867 --> 38:44.667
- HE WAS VERY HELPFUL WITH
THAT ONE DESSERT, THE BALLS.

38:44.667 --> 38:46.633
WHEN I SAW YOU GUYS
OVER IN THE CORNER

38:46.633 --> 38:49.867
JUST CUPPING THOSE BALLS,
YOU WERE SO INTO IT.

38:49.867 --> 38:52.900
UM, NO, I THINK YOU WERE
A LITTLE BIT, UM, OUT OF LINE,

38:52.900 --> 38:56.567
ENTITLED, AND, UH,
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TEAMWORK,

38:56.567 --> 39:00.367
BUT WE'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU
DIDN'T BOAST ABOUT IT SO MUCH.

39:00.367 --> 39:03.567
- BRUNO, UNFAIR
CRITICISM BY KATE?

39:03.567 --> 39:04.734
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

39:04.734 --> 39:06.967
I MEAN, I REALLY TRIED
TO APPROACH HER

39:06.967 --> 39:08.834
SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE SEASON

39:08.834 --> 39:10.200
AND TRIED
TO BE HELPFUL

39:10.200 --> 39:12.600
AND TRYING TO TURN
THINGS AROUND WITH HER,

39:12.600 --> 39:14.433
BUT SHE JUST SEEMED THAT
SHE WAS CUTTING MY LEGS

39:14.433 --> 39:16.900
ALL THE TIME WITH NO REASON
WHEN I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP,

39:16.900 --> 39:17.934
SO THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY.

39:17.934 --> 39:19.000
- YOU DID IT TO YOURSELF.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.567
- BRI, SHANNON
FROM FRESNO SAID,

39:20.567 --> 39:23.900
"WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
JEN OR BRUNO AS A STEW?"

39:23.900 --> 39:25.100
- BRUNO.

39:25.100 --> 39:27.333
- WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON MATT AS A CHEF

39:27.333 --> 39:30.300
AND HIS EVOLUTION?

39:30.300 --> 39:31.667
- IT WAS TOO LITTLE
TOO LATE.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.967
I WANTED TO-- I WANTED TO SEE
THE MATT THAT WE SAW

39:33.967 --> 39:36.300
ON THE LAST CHARTER
FROM JUMP STREET

39:36.300 --> 39:39.467
BECAUSE I ALWAYS FELT THAT
MATT HAD IT INSIDE OF HIM.

39:39.467 --> 39:42.834
- YEAH.
- THAT HE DIDN'T NEED BRUNO.

39:42.834 --> 39:47.400
HE DIDN'T NEED ANYONE
OTHER THAN WHAT HE HAS,

39:47.400 --> 39:50.867
WHAT HE POSSESSES IN HIS
OWN MIND AND HIS TALENTS.

39:50.867 --> 39:52.867
- KATE, DO YOU THINK BRUNO
WOULD MAKE A BETTER STEW

39:52.867 --> 39:54.000
THAN DECKHAND?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.300
- I WOULDN'T WORK WITH HIM
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

39:55.300 --> 39:58.667
HE RESPECTS ME, BUT I THINK
HE WOULD BE A WONDERFUL STEW.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.333
- BRUNO,
DO YOU RESPECT KATE?

40:00.333 --> 40:04.467
- I DO RESPECT EVERYONE
AS LONG EVERYONE RESPECTS ME,

40:04.467 --> 40:05.834
AS WELL.

40:05.834 --> 40:08.433
PEOPLE HAS TO UNDERSTAND
THAT REGARDLESS YOUR STRIPES,

40:08.433 --> 40:11.266
YOUR POSITION,
RESPECT IS MUTUAL.

40:11.266 --> 40:15.533
AND KATE, UNFORTUNATELY,
A LOT OF MOMENTS,

40:15.533 --> 40:17.300
IT WAS JUST
VERY UNPLEASANT

40:17.300 --> 40:19.500
AND VERY DISRESPECTFUL
TO PEOPLE. SO--

40:19.500 --> 40:21.333
- ALL RIGHT, BRUNO,
CONGRATULATIONS

40:21.333 --> 40:24.867
ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT
AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.

40:24.867 --> 40:26.633
- THANK YOU, GUYS.
- SEE YA, BRUNO.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.300
- LOVE YOU, BRU-BRU.
- SEE YOU LATER.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.900
- MISS YOU.
- UP NEXT...

40:30.900 --> 40:32.200
- SHOULDA KISSED BAKER.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.767
[all]
- AWW!

40:34.767 --> 40:36.633
- DO IT, DO IT,
DO IT NOW!

40:44.400 --> 40:44.700
- WELL, BEFORE

40:44.700 --> 40:44.967
- WELL, BEFORE
WE DISEMBARK,

40:45.700 --> 40:47.066
I HAVE A FEW
REMAINING QUESTIONS

40:47.066 --> 40:48.500
FOR THE CREW
OF THE "VALOR."

40:48.500 --> 40:51.400
CAPTAIN LEE, GAIL FROM
SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA SAID,

40:51.400 --> 40:53.667
"FROM EVERYBODY
YOU HAVE AS A CREW MEMBER,

40:53.667 --> 40:57.900
"WHO WOULD YOU SELECT
AS YOUR ALL-STAR CREW TEAM?

40:57.900 --> 41:00.433
FROM EVERYONE YOU'VE HAD
A CREW MEMBER

41:00.433 --> 41:03.433
FROM, UM,
ALL THE SEASONS.

41:03.433 --> 41:06.533
- I WOULD KEEP KATE
AS CHIEF STEW.

41:06.533 --> 41:08.633
NICO WOULD BE IN THERE
IN SOME FASHION.

41:08.633 --> 41:12.133
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT,
BUT I STILL-- YOU KNOW,

41:12.133 --> 41:15.233
HE HAS THE TALENT.
I LIKE EDDIE A LOT.

41:15.233 --> 41:19.300
KAT-- I THOUGHT KAT
WAS AN OUTSTANDING STEW.

41:19.300 --> 41:21.433
BEN-BEN-BEN WAS
A GOOD CHEF.

41:21.433 --> 41:25.800
UH, YEAH, I WOULD--
I WOULD WORK WITH BEN, AGAIN.

41:25.800 --> 41:26.767
- KELLEY?

41:26.767 --> 41:28.333
- YEAH, I WOULD WORK
WITH KELLEY, AS WELL.

41:28.333 --> 41:30.300
- UH, TAYLOR FROM LONG BEACH,
CALIFORNIA SAID,

41:30.300 --> 41:32.533
"NICO, YOU TOLD BAKER
THAT, AFTER THE SEASON,

41:32.533 --> 41:34.066
"YOU WERE GOING HOME
TO JOIN

41:34.066 --> 41:36.166
"A PLUMBING
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.

41:36.166 --> 41:38.400
"DID YOU DO IT?"
- UH, I-I DID DO IT.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.200
I'M WORKING
FOR MY FAMILY'S,

UH, PLUMBING AND CONCRETE

UH, AND THEN ALSO STUDYING
TO GET MY CAPTAIN'S LICENSE

41:45.700 --> 41:48.367
BECAUSE ME AND MY BROTHER
ARE BUYING A BOAT IN CHICAGO.

41:48.367 --> 41:49.767
- AWESOME.
- THAT'S GREAT.
- THAT'S COOL.

41:49.767 --> 41:51.600
- SO, I'M GONNA BE CHARTERING
IT OUT NEXT SUMMER.

41:51.600 --> 41:52.767
- WHAT KIND OF BOAT?
- WHAT DID YOU NAME IT?

41:52.767 --> 41:54.934
- UH, I DON'T KNOW YET.
WE'RE STILL LOOKING. SO...

41:58.100 --> 42:00.233
- ANYONE HAVE ANY REGRETS
FROM THE SEASON

42:00.233 --> 42:03.133
THAT THEY DIDN'T GET
TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?

42:03.133 --> 42:04.900
- SHOULDA KISSED BAKER.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.767
[all]
- AWW!

42:07.767 --> 42:09.233
- DO IT, DO IT,
DO IT-- DO IT NOW.

42:09.233 --> 42:10.367
- DO IT NOW.

42:10.367 --> 42:13.166
- OH, GOSH, IT'S LIKE THE
KISS CAM AT BASEBALL GAMES.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.533
- THERE'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
COME ON.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.033
- NOT ROMANTIC ENOUGH--
YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.800
- DO A HOBBY. DO A HOBBY.
- TAKE HER OUT TONIGHT.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.166
AT LEAST ASK HER
TO-TO DINNER TONIGHT.

42:19.166 --> 42:20.867
- ANY, UH,
ANY FRIENDSHIPS?

42:20.867 --> 42:22.767
LIKE, I MEAN, IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU AND JEN

42:22.767 --> 42:24.533
MADE A REAL FRIENDSHIP.

42:24.533 --> 42:26.500
- I THINK THAT I'M FRIENDS
WITH EVERYBODY HERE,

42:26.500 --> 42:27.934
BUT JEN AND I
CERTAINLY CLICKED.

42:27.934 --> 42:30.567
I THINK WE'RE CUT FROM
THE SAME CLOTH, FLORIDA GIRLS.

42:30.567 --> 42:32.667
- YEAH, ME AND MATT HAVE
A LITTLE BROMANCE GOING ON.

42:32.667 --> 42:33.700
- YEAH.
- WE'VE BEEN HANGING OUT.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.100
- BAKER IS MY GIRL.
- KEEP FLYING IN AND OUT.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.166
- NICE.
- HOLLA.

42:36.166 --> 42:37.300
- KYLE, DID YOU MAKE A FRIEND?

42:37.300 --> 42:38.367
- I'M JUST LONELY
ALL THE TIME.

42:38.367 --> 42:39.500
- NICE.
- I WONDER WHY.

42:39.500 --> 42:40.800
- I BEAT EJ AT FOOSBALL,
THOUGH, TODAY.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.100
SO, ME AND-- ME AND EJ
ARE STARTING SOMETHING.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.233
WE'RE STARTING SOMETHING.

42:44.233 --> 42:45.200
OH, YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE ME HANGING?

42:45.200 --> 42:46.600
OH, CHEERS.
THANK YOU.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.667
- ALL RIGHT.

42:47.667 --> 42:49.467
WELL, THE CAPTAIN
DOESN'T NEED ANY--

42:49.467 --> 42:52.200
YOU HAVE-- YOU HAVE
MRS. STUD OF THE SEA.

ALL RIGHT.
