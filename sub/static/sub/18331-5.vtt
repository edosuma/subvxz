Hey, hey, hey...

01:10.361 --> 01:12.155
Where is my couch going?

01:12.238 --> 01:13.782
This is my lazy Sunday.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.285
As opposed to your lazy
Monday through Saturday?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.498
It just so happens
that I have a very hectic life.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.709
But today I'm relaxing
with my rock star biographies.

01:25.293 --> 01:28.213
I've got Tina Turner and Janis Joplin

01:28.296 --> 01:29.297
and Ariana Grande.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.300
It's mostly pictures.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.512
Sorry, but Ramona needs the room

01:35.595 --> 01:40.016
for her big audition for world-renowned
dance coach, Signore Giuseppe Pignoli.

01:40.683 --> 01:44.479
If he likes me, he's my ticket
to the San Francisco School of the Arts.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.064
Giuseppe's the best.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.109
When he took on Miley Cyrus,
she could barely even twerk.

01:51.611 --> 01:55.782
Oh, thanks for moving the furniture.
More room for Tommy's playdate.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.326
Whoa, whoa, what playdate?
I need the living room.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.619
Oh, so do I.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.622
I have two toddlers coming over
from our Mommy and Me group.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.332
I need Tommy to make some friends.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.918
Can 1-year-olds really make friends?

02:07.001 --> 02:08.086
I mean...

02:09.087 --> 02:11.089
They have the vocabulary of a carrot.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.467
Show her you're not a carrot.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.140
OK, he's a carrot.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.687
OK, chickens, welcome to your new home.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.109
A little help here?

02:31.192 --> 02:34.362
Uh, Max. What are those?

02:34.445 --> 02:37.115
Wow, you really did grow up in the city.

02:40.827 --> 02:41.744
They're chickens.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.454
The goofy one is Joey,

02:43.538 --> 02:45.165
the one with the big beak is Danny

02:45.248 --> 02:47.208
and the one with the Elvis hair
is Jesse.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.839
I meant how did you get them?

02:52.922 --> 02:54.841
Fernando took me to the chicken store.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.969
It's a part of my One Kid
Can Make A Difference project.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.762
We talked about this.

03:01.389 --> 03:05.226
We talked about you starting
a little backyard sustainable farm.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.228
You can't have a farm without chickens.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.688
Just ask Old McDonald.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.356
He had a cluck, cluck everywhere.

03:13.568 --> 03:17.488
[sighs] I did not know until today
that a chicken could get car sick.

03:20.408 --> 03:23.870
Did you buy Max three chickens
without my permission?

03:23.953 --> 03:25.914
[Spanish accent] Actually, I bought four.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.958
But I opened the sun roof
without thinking.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.172
So much for chicken Becky.

03:36.507 --> 03:40.094
Hola, hijita, are you ready
for your big audition?

03:40.178 --> 03:42.555
I'm ready. But I really need your help.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.807
I need you to impress Signore Pignoli

03:44.891 --> 03:47.477
with how much our family
loves the art of dance.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.645
Of course.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.356
We are your biggest athletic supporters.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.902
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.113
It means we are
a jockstrap for her dreams.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.827
Oh. Well, then,
I guess it is what you meant.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.455
[pecking]

04:09.332 --> 04:10.917
Do you hear pecking at the door?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
Chicken Becky, you found us!

04:24.430 --> 04:25.556
Come in.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.900
Chickens, meet my dog, Cosmo,
and my Aunt Stephanie.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.069
She's taking a little vacation.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.529
From what?

04:39.612 --> 04:40.738
Nobody knows.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.076
From a sassy 8-year-old.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.666
I'm not sassy, I'm delightful.

04:54.669 --> 04:58.172
Mom says either I have to help you
with your garden or "read something."

04:58.256 --> 04:59.549
So here I am.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.219
Whoa, Mom let you have chickens?!

05:03.303 --> 05:06.347
Of course she did. I'm her favorite son.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.809
Her face lights up
every time I walk into a room.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.022
Mom loves us all the same.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.403
It's so cute that you believe that.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.324
You know, I'm gonna go read something.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.284
No, you're not.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.745
You're right.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.414
Chickens,

05:31.998 --> 05:33.458
have some corn cob.

05:33.916 --> 05:34.959
[barks]

05:35.835 --> 05:39.130
[sighs] Cosmo, I love you,
but I'm very busy.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.591
Here, go fetch.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.057
So, just between us chickens,

05:49.140 --> 05:51.642
how much do you guys
hate Colonel Sanders?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.731
OK, Tommy, Teddy, Bryan,

05:56.814 --> 05:59.025
there's gonna be
a dance audition in here

05:59.108 --> 06:01.903
and there's a chicken convention
in the backyard.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.114
So what if we bake cookies
in the kitchen?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.532
Any objections?

06:06.616 --> 06:07.742
[silence]

06:15.124 --> 06:17.001
OK, it's unanimous!

06:18.961 --> 06:20.254
[doorbell rings]

06:20.338 --> 06:21.589
It's always open!

06:22.673 --> 06:24.217
[panting] Hey, Deej.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.052
Hey! What are you guys doing

06:26.135 --> 06:31.099
in your little, matching little
bike shorts that are very little?

06:32.642 --> 06:34.977
Well, we were just mountain biking
up and down

06:35.061 --> 06:37.230
all seven hills of San Francisco.

06:37.814 --> 06:38.898
What fun that was!

06:40.900 --> 06:43.319
And next, we're gonna swim to Alcatraz.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.404
Oh, boy!

06:46.155 --> 06:48.783
As soon as I use the little girls' room.
I hope you don't mind.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.702
[still panting]
You just hurry up, sweetie.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.163
I can't wait to burn some more calories!

06:54.247 --> 06:55.373
[fake laughs]

06:56.082 --> 06:58.084
She's killing me, DJ. I gotta lay down.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.460
[groans]

07:06.467 --> 07:09.053
Hey, what are you doing
with that corn cob?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.097
Cosmo, drop that. You can't have that.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.056
[gasps] No!

07:12.974 --> 07:13.850
He swallowed it.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.560
Oh, that's not good.

07:17.353 --> 07:21.107
Mom, thanks for making me read.
I just finished To Kill a Mockingbird.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.818
Oh, spoiler alert,
they kill the mockingbird.

07:26.362 --> 07:30.199
Boys, we have a bigger problem.
Cosmo swallowed a corn cob.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.535
Dogs can't digest something that big.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.744
I didn't know that.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.205
I threw one for him to fetch.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.167
We gotta take him to the clinic
and get this corn cob out of there.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.376
I'm coming with you.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.711
And so is Jackson.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.171
Why do I have to go?

07:43.254 --> 07:47.091
Because when I don't have my dog,
you're my emotional support animal.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.637
[shouts] Steph!

07:53.806 --> 07:58.352
Hey. You would not believe what they put
Ariana Grande through on Sam &amp; Cat.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.062
It is a miracle she's so grounded.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.817
Matt and I need to get to the clinic.
Will you watch the toddlers?

08:06.402 --> 08:07.361
All of them?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.697
No, pick your favorite.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.826
Thank you. OK. All right, great. Have fun!

08:13.910 --> 08:15.620
[Matt] Here we go, in the car, come on.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.163
[Steph] Uh, hurry back.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.207
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.713
What do you say you little ankle biters
give me a break and take a nap, huh?

08:25.796 --> 08:27.006
Yeah?

08:27.089 --> 08:29.550
Right. On your marks, get set... sleep.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.390
All right, I should tire you out first.
OK, ready? Here we go.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.517
Everybody chase me.

08:37.975 --> 08:38.809
Here we go!

08:38.893 --> 08:41.270
-And I'm running!
-Ooh! Cardio!

08:49.904 --> 08:54.116
Well, there is definitely
a corn cob in Cosmo's belly.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.912
That's not the one I threw.

08:59.747 --> 09:00.831
Mine was yellow.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.672
We're just gonna make
a little incision and take it out.

09:08.297 --> 09:09.966
You're going to cut Cosmo open?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.926
[panicked]
Don't do it! Cut me open instead!

09:13.970 --> 09:15.346
How's that gonna help?

09:16.847 --> 09:18.891
You're right. Cut Jackson!

09:21.269 --> 09:22.979
Max, relax, OK?

09:23.062 --> 09:25.565
We're gonna put Cosmo to sleep,
it won't hurt him a bit.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.483
Cosmo?

09:28.192 --> 09:30.945
I'm sorry. I'm your doggy daddy
and I let you down.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.448
Come on, boy.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.578
Hey, don't worry, Max, OK?
He's gonna be fine.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.079
He'd better be.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.041
Cosmo's my best friend in the whole world.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.086
OK. No pressure.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.011
A little nerve-racking,
operating on our family dog.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.763
I really appreciate you being here.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.640
I'm always here for you.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.309
[cell beeps]

10:02.226 --> 10:03.060
Sorry.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.021
Oh, it's Crystal.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.314
Oh...

10:07.815 --> 10:09.358
That's what I forgot.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.698
Once upon a time, there was
a beautiful princess named Stephanie.

10:15.781 --> 10:20.077
And when I say beautiful, I am talking
fairest in the land, smokin' hot.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.833
Now, one lazy Sunday,
which she totally deserved,

10:25.916 --> 10:29.712
she was suddenly besieged
by three tiny monsters.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.799
Each with their own magic power.

10:34.550 --> 10:38.262
One could spill apple juice
out of even the strongest sippy cup.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.308
One could throw a tantrum
for no reason whatsoever.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.813
And the third, he could fill a diaper
with such speed and volume

10:47.897 --> 10:50.941
that it brought tears
to the princess' eyes.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.109
[fake cries]

10:52.985 --> 10:54.153
Aww.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.071
Yes...

10:55.154 --> 10:56.072
[clucking]

10:56.155 --> 10:56.989
Oh.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.035
And look, enchanted chickens
from a magic portal.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.161
[doorbell rings]

11:02.244 --> 11:04.330
I got it, it's Signore Pignoli.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.125
Agh! What's on my dance floor?

11:08.209 --> 11:11.837
Well, it's, you know,
some free-range chickens,

11:12.755 --> 11:15.716
some free-range babies
and... a couple sock puppets.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.928
Maybe he won't notice.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.767
Buongiorno!

11:29.772 --> 11:31.148
This is not what it looks like.

11:31.232 --> 11:35.611
It looks like a petting zoo
full of chickens and piggies.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.656
Well, we were just leaving.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.366
Hi, I'm Stephanie.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.326
[little girl voice]
And I'm Princess Stephanie!

11:43.369 --> 11:46.288
I'm sorry. You're the first adult
that I've talked to all day.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.915
Fascinating.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.291
Here, hold the baby.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.293
Yes.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.462
All right, shoo chickens.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.465
Danny, Jesse, Joey, Becky,

11:56.549 --> 11:58.175
get out, this is our house now.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.972
Here, I'll take that.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.682
Oh...

12:04.765 --> 12:07.977
And look what is going on in there.
There is a chicken riding a baby.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.606
All right. No more distractions.

12:12.690 --> 12:13.983
I hope not.

12:14.733 --> 12:19.738
[Fernando] Ra-da-da-da da da...

12:26.203 --> 12:27.580
Who are those people?

12:28.456 --> 12:29.540
I have no idea.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.168
We are Fernando

12:32.251 --> 12:35.671
and Kimberlina Gibbler-Hernandez
-Guerrero-Fernandez-Guerrero,

12:35.754 --> 12:36.714
the proud parents

12:36.797 --> 12:40.384
of Ramona Gibbler-Hernandez
-Guerrero-Fernandez-Guerrero.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.639
[laughs awkwardly]
Oh, that's right, they're my family.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.433
They love to dress up.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.102
[in Italian]
It's an honor for you to meet us.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.687
[Signore Pignoli] What?

12:54.857 --> 12:57.026
We just came from
our ballroom dancing class,

12:57.109 --> 13:00.529
because everyone in our family
loves the art of dance.

13:02.531 --> 13:07.953
[in Italian] I've heard you are the best
egg beater in all the dance coach.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.127
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.005
[in Italian] Grilled cheese.

13:18.088 --> 13:18.923
[groans]

13:23.135 --> 13:24.845
You guys are embarrassing me.

13:24.929 --> 13:25.804
How?

13:25.888 --> 13:27.932
We were being supportive
like you asked us to.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.694

I made Mom file a police report!

Be nice to me, I'm having a bad day.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.134
Did I ever tell you about Leon, my gecko?

14:45.217 --> 14:48.178
The one that left you to go work
at that insurance company?

14:49.847 --> 14:51.098
Yes, but...

14:52.266 --> 14:53.183
I made that up.

14:54.101 --> 14:59.315
The truth is I let Leon play outside
and I went inside for a fudgsicle.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.776
When I came back... Leon was gone.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.823
So he can't save me
up to 15% on my car insurance?

15:10.951 --> 15:11.827
I'm afraid not.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.706
How's that story supposed to help me?

15:16.874 --> 15:19.084
Not sure.
It's the only pet story I've got.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.003

Based on what we overheard
while eavesdropping...

17:41.018 --> 17:45.647
the magic word is,
"Will you tango with me, Papa?"

Will you tango with me, Papa?

17:50.152 --> 17:50.986

[sighs] Mom, I've been thinking.

All of this happened
because I'm a terrible doggy daddy.

I don't deserve Cosmo,
so could you take care of him for me?

more than you do.

a second chance.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.978
In the middle of a pretty awkward moment.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.189
That's happening again.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.319
Maybe we should talk
about that awkward thing.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.280
