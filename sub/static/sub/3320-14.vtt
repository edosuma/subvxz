WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:04.569
Hey, you got a minute?

00:04.656 --> 00:06.180
Yeah, what'’s up?

00:06.267 --> 00:08.312
Well, since I'’ve
gone back to school,

00:08.399 --> 00:10.184
I was hoping you could

00:10.271 --> 00:12.142
be a little flexible
with my schedule,

00:12.229 --> 00:14.014
you know,
if I have a test or something?

00:14.101 --> 00:16.364
Sure, but try and give me
as much notice as possible.

00:16.451 --> 00:17.539
You got it.

00:17.626 --> 00:18.801
I have to leave now.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.455
What?!

00:20.542 --> 00:22.283
But I don'’t have anybody
to cover for you.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.634
Oh, come on, Gabriel... please?

00:27.375 --> 00:29.072
That lower lip thing
used to work

00:29.159 --> 00:30.508
when we were sleeping together.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.989
Not so much now?

00:33.076 --> 00:35.600
No. A little.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.864
So, is this test
really that important?

00:38.951 --> 00:40.475
They'’re all important.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.867
I'’ve gotta think
about my future.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.478
I want to go to law school.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.523
I don'’t want to spend
the rest of my life

00:45.610 --> 00:47.525
working in a stupid...

00:47.612 --> 00:49.875
I want to go to law school.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.095
Fine.
I'’ll get Shelly to cover.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.488
She has no dreams.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.100
We need to talk.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.363
Uh, Christy, you remember
my wife Claudia.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.322
Yes. Nice to see you again.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.019
[dismissively]:
Yeah.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.849
Why don'’t I give
you guys some privacy.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.372
Relax, this will
only take a minute.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.026
I want a divorce.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.202
What?!

01:12.289 --> 01:13.595
I just came from
my therapist'’s office,

01:13.682 --> 01:15.118
and we decided it'’s over.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.989
Claudia, where is
this coming from?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.600
Oh, don'’t act so surprised.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.645
I only married you
to punish my parents.

01:20.732 --> 01:23.692
And my mother'’s dead now,
so... mission accomplished.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.391
Yeah, but your father'’s
still alive.

01:27.478 --> 01:30.264
I can get you pregnant.
He will hate that.

01:30.351 --> 01:33.049
Hmm... "Product of Spain."

01:33.136 --> 01:34.746
It'’s over, Gabriel.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.444
I want you out of
the house tonight.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.576
Where am I supposed to sleep?
In my office?

01:38.663 --> 01:40.056
Oh, this isn'’t
your office anymore.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.884
Daddy said I could fire you.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.844
Mmm! Salty.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.411
You can'’t do that.

01:47.498 --> 01:48.978
Regardless of
how you feel about me,

01:49.065 --> 01:50.936
I do a damn good job
running this place.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.112
Oh, please.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.591
A monkey could do your job.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.202
You want to manage a restaurant?

01:57.508 --> 01:58.944
Excuse me?

01:59.031 --> 02:00.903
Christy'’s not going
to take my job.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.558
She'’s loyal to me and she has
big dreams of her own.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.866
What'’s it pay?

02:27.234 --> 02:29.018
I'’m sorry, Beverly, I'’m just
a little behind on the repairs.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.541
I'’ll get to you
as soon as I can.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.500
BEVERLY:
You said that last week!

02:32.587 --> 02:34.154
The latch on my window'’s been
broken for two months!

02:34.241 --> 02:36.373
Somebody could get in
and murder me in my sleep!

02:36.460 --> 02:38.897
Yeah, that'’d be a shame.
What time you go to bed?

02:38.984 --> 02:40.160
BEVERLY:
What?

02:43.641 --> 02:46.209
I want to fix it
before you go to bed.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.605
BEVERLY:
I don'’t even know how

02:50.692 --> 02:51.867
you call yourself
a building manager.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.564
Beverly, do I have to remind you

02:53.651 --> 02:55.262
that I put up all
the Christmas decorations,

02:55.349 --> 02:57.220
which I paid for
out of my own pocket?

02:57.307 --> 02:58.482
BEVERLY:
Yeah, it'’s February.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.354
When are they coming down?

03:00.441 --> 03:01.659
[stove timer dings]

03:01.746 --> 03:03.226
You'’ll never guess
what happened.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.185
Just say "uh-huh"
every once in a while.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.838
BEVERLY: I'’m not the only tenant
who'’s dissatisfied.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.231
[deep voice]:
Uh-huh.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.798
BEVERLY:
If things don'’t change,

03:09.885 --> 03:11.626
we may have to
go to the building owner.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.193
Uh-huh.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.672
That'’s what
you think I sound like?

03:14.759 --> 03:16.718
[deep voice]:
Uh-huh.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.154
BEVERLY:
"Uh-huh" what?

03:18.241 --> 03:19.503
Um...

03:19.590 --> 03:21.418
Beverly, I promise you.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.072
I'’ll get your window fixed
by the end of the day.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.334
BEVERLY:
I'’ll believe it when I see it.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.509
Uh-huh.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.731
Weird, I do sound like that.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.167
What'’s going on?

03:31.254 --> 03:32.734
Nothing.
I'’m just a little behind.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.257
Do you know how to fix
an electric garage gate?

03:34.344 --> 03:35.824
No.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.391
How about removing
a beehive from the wall

03:37.478 --> 03:38.783
behind an old lady'’s
shower stall?

03:38.870 --> 03:39.915
You can keep the honey.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.787
Are we gonna
get kicked out of here?

03:42.874 --> 03:44.920
No, don'’t be silly.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.487
Have I ever let you...

03:46.574 --> 03:48.358
So how was work?

03:48.445 --> 03:51.405
Actually... amazing.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.537
I... got promoted.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.452
I am now the manager

03:55.539 --> 03:56.453
of the Rustic Fig.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.238
Congratulations!

03:58.325 --> 03:59.674
Thanks.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.197
What about your plan
to go to law school?

04:01.284 --> 04:03.199
Uh... I can do both.

04:03.286 --> 04:06.202
But, this way, it'’ll mean
a lot more money each week.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.943
Enough to get us
a new apartment?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.988
I thought you said there
was nothing to worry about.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.426
Yeah... I also told the woman
in 3H I didn'’t smell gas.

04:12.513 --> 04:15.037
Now she has no eyebrows.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.125
[phone rings]

04:16.212 --> 04:18.432
Oh, God! It never ends!

04:18.519 --> 04:20.303
Aw... Want me to
get that for you?

04:20.390 --> 04:21.738
Will you, please?

04:21.826 --> 04:22.914
Sure.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.134
[ringing continues]

04:25.221 --> 04:26.353
Hello?

04:27.528 --> 04:28.398
It'’s for you.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.271
[no voice]

04:33.577 --> 04:37.102
Hey, everybody, thanks for
coming in a little early.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.626
I just wanted
to say a few words

04:38.713 --> 04:39.801
before we get started.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.977
I know we all loved Gabriel.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.458
Hah!

04:44.545 --> 04:47.330
Yeah, and, uh,
he will be missed.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.594
Oh. Paul says, "Hah."

04:52.074 --> 04:53.945
Anyway, as your new manager,

04:54.032 --> 04:55.643
I want you to know

04:55.730 --> 04:58.298
I'’ve walked a mile
in all of your shoes.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.822
So you should think of me

05:00.909 --> 05:02.563
not so much as your new boss,

05:02.650 --> 05:04.695
but as a friend.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.088
Someone who knows
what you'’re going through.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.003
Someone who cares.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.266
Oh, this is gonna
be hilarious.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.705
All right, let'’s get set

05:14.792 --> 05:17.665
for a great Rustic Fig
lunch service.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.145
Come on, everybody,
let'’s bring it in.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.192
Good idea.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.280
Let'’s get to work.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.632
Christy, my babysitter
just called

05:28.719 --> 05:29.981
and my daughter'’s
running a fever.

05:30.068 --> 05:30.982
I gotta go.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.636
Really?

05:32.723 --> 05:35.204
Gee, I'’ve got nobody
to cover for you.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.293
Did the babysitter try
giving her a little Motrin?

05:37.380 --> 05:38.816
She tried.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.514
I might have to take her
to the doctor.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.254
[sighing]:
I... get it.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.255
Go.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.779
Thanks.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.302
As a mom,
I knew you'’d understand.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.568
Where'’s Gabriel?

05:51.655 --> 05:54.658
Oh, uh, he doesn'’t
work here anymore.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.356
I am the new manager.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.575
Really? You?

05:58.662 --> 06:00.534
What'’s that supposed to mean?

06:00.621 --> 06:03.319
It means I shouldn'’t say
what I'’m thinking.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.060
Anyway, I just want
to let you know

06:05.147 --> 06:06.670
that I'’m all alone
out there parking cars,

06:06.757 --> 06:07.889
so things
might be a little slow.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.064
What happened to your crew?

06:09.151 --> 06:10.674
One guy violated his parole,

06:10.761 --> 06:12.067
another got picked up
by Immigration,

06:12.154 --> 06:13.590
and little Frankie
just got cast

06:13.677 --> 06:15.505
in the touring company
of Wicked.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.421
Oh, good for him.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.380
Yeah, it'’s his dream.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.732
Christy... did you sign
for this produce?

06:24.819 --> 06:26.560
[clears throat]

06:26.647 --> 06:28.431
"C. Plunkett, Manager."

06:28.518 --> 06:30.259
Yep, that'’s me.

06:30.346 --> 06:33.697
Well, does C. Plunkett know
what broccoli looks like?

06:35.438 --> 06:38.136
C. Plunkett thought
it was cauliflower.

06:38.223 --> 06:41.444
No, these brown turds
you signed for are cauliflower.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.361
Paul, we'’re done
with the glare.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.758
Thanks for finally
getting over here.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.237
You'’re welcome.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.587
Must'’ve called you
six, seven times.

06:53.674 --> 06:54.849
Yeah, well, I'’m here now.

06:56.807 --> 06:57.939
You see where it'’s leaking?

06:58.026 --> 06:59.549
Yeah, I sure do.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.551
Hey, I hope you
don'’t mind me asking,

07:01.638 --> 07:04.772
but are you totally blind or
can you see a little bit?

07:04.859 --> 07:06.077
Not a thing.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.078
Uh-huh.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.301
I can feel you flapping
your hand in front of my face.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.259
That wasn'’t me,
I'’m way over here.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.567
Whatever.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.264
Can you fix the faucet?

07:19.351 --> 07:20.788
"Can I fix the faucet?"

07:20.875 --> 07:22.267
Of course I can fix the faucet.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.400
What are you reading?

07:24.487 --> 07:25.923
Wow! Good ears!

07:26.010 --> 07:27.969
You'’re like Stevie Wonder.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.753
Except I'’m not black.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.452
Gotcha.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.237
Good one.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.326
It'’s a, uh, professional
plumbing manual.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.806
For dummies?

07:38.893 --> 07:40.764
You'’ll never know.

07:43.245 --> 07:46.291
Okay, this seems
pretty straightforward.

07:46.378 --> 07:47.815
So, how'’d you lose your sight?

07:47.902 --> 07:49.643
Defending our country.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.166
Thank you for your service.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.647
I got syphilis
in a Saigon whorehouse.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.477
Still. Brave.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.219
How'’d you fake your way
into this job?

08:01.306 --> 08:03.221
What makes you think
I faked my way into...

08:06.616 --> 08:09.358
Didn'’t turn off
the main water valve, did you?

08:09.445 --> 08:11.316
Didn'’t wear a condom, did you?

08:16.060 --> 08:17.453
A lot of entrees
stacking up here.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.672
It'’s okay, I got it.

08:18.759 --> 08:21.065
Uh... table six, please.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.763
Thank you. Great job.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.026
Uh... table two, please.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.157
Thank you. Great job!

08:26.244 --> 08:29.030
Uh... [gasps]

08:29.117 --> 08:31.032
Those are hot.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.903
Thanks for the heads up.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.732
Thanks for the
yellow broccoli!

08:35.818 --> 08:38.386
I am C. Plunkett, Manager.
I am C. Plunkett, Manager.

08:38.474 --> 08:39.519
Be right with you!

08:39.606 --> 08:40.520
Ah!

08:40.607 --> 08:41.782
Careful, hot plates.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.217
[clears throat]

08:43.304 --> 08:44.524
[quietly]:
C. Plunkett, Manager.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.525
Whoa!

08:45.612 --> 08:47.265
Uh...

08:47.352 --> 08:49.703
Ramone, can you do me a favor
and please mop this up?

08:49.790 --> 08:50.834
No habla.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.183
Oh, you totally habla!

08:53.402 --> 08:54.882
I am so sorry.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.753
Let me just
get your menus...

08:56.840 --> 08:59.800
Hey, I'’ve been waiting
45 minutes for my car.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.062
Yeah, we'’re a little
short-handed

09:01.149 --> 09:02.933
at the valet station.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.196
While you wait, why don'’t you
have a drink on the house?

09:05.283 --> 09:07.285
You want me
to drink and drive?

09:07.372 --> 09:10.550
Oh, I'’m sure you'’ll sober up
by the time you get your car.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.291
Please, follow me.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.337
WOMAN:
Excuse me,

09:15.424 --> 09:17.078
I have a problem.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.775
Uh, here--
your table'’s right over there.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.385
You'’re gonna need
two more chairs,

09:20.472 --> 09:22.213
so you can just
take '’em from that table.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.737
[clears throat]

09:23.824 --> 09:24.868
Yes, ma'’am?

09:24.955 --> 09:26.435
This wine is off.

09:26.522 --> 09:27.741
Oh, no, that can'’t be.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.264
That'’s an '’06 Brunello.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.309
Go ahead, taste it.No, I can'’t.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.876
Oh, so you don'’t like it either?

09:32.963 --> 09:34.878
No, it'’s not that,
it'’s just...

09:34.965 --> 09:36.924
Just take a sip and you'’ll see
what I'’m talking about.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.621
I can'’t drink it, lady.
I'’m an alcoholic.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.144
Oh, so am I! Drink it!

09:42.016 --> 09:43.757
Mm, hang on, I'’ll get
you another bottle.

09:43.844 --> 09:44.758
I didn'’t forget about...

09:44.845 --> 09:45.715
Whoa!

09:47.935 --> 09:49.066
You say mop.

09:53.636 --> 09:57.901
Did you notice the entire toilet
moves when you sit on it?

09:57.988 --> 10:00.164
Yeah, it'’s not
bolted down right.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.339
You gotta hover.

10:03.341 --> 10:04.778
I hover at work.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.562
I like to sit at home.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.304
You can'’t fix it?

10:09.391 --> 10:11.219
No, I can'’t fix it!

10:15.745 --> 10:17.181
Don'’t bark at me.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.269
I'’m sorry.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.271
I had a bad day.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.795
That makes two of us.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.492
People yelled at me today.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.450
I had a lady kick me.

10:25.537 --> 10:26.800
Seriously?

10:26.887 --> 10:29.759
In her defense,
I kind of clipped her

10:29.846 --> 10:32.632
when I was parking her car.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.200
Can I tell you a secret?

10:36.287 --> 10:37.637
I think I might'’ve bitten off

10:37.724 --> 10:39.813
more than I can chew
with this job.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.119
It'’s not a secret, Mom.

10:47.472 --> 10:50.040
Do you think you'’ll survive
the restaurant?

10:50.127 --> 10:51.694
Not unless I get help.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.697
I was thinking about asking
Gabriel for advice.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.613
You'’re gonna ask the guy whose
job you stole how to do the job?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.833
I didn'’t steal it.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.793
It was given to me
in lieu of a monkey.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.839
[phone ringing]Oh, damn!

11:05.926 --> 11:08.015
Do you want me to answer that?

11:08.102 --> 11:10.060
No, thank you.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.456
Uh-huh?

11:14.543 --> 11:16.806
[groans]

11:16.893 --> 11:19.417
Okay, I'’ll be right there.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.812
It'’s times like this,

11:22.899 --> 11:26.816
I miss selling drugs
in bad neighborhoods.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.993
And I miss sitting
in my stroller watching you.

11:47.445 --> 11:50.405
You'’ve got to be kidding me.

11:50.492 --> 11:53.321
Do I have balls or what?

11:54.714 --> 11:55.976
Go away.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.413
Oh... come on!

11:58.500 --> 12:00.197
If it helps, uh,

12:00.284 --> 12:03.592
I'’m failing miserably
trying to do your job.

12:03.679 --> 12:04.898
Why didn'’t you say so?

12:04.985 --> 12:06.377
Come on in.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.426
Ooh, hey!

12:11.513 --> 12:13.820
Nice digs.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.779
I just got thrown out of
a 6,000-square-foot home

12:16.866 --> 12:18.912
in a gated community.

12:18.999 --> 12:22.785
Okay, but I bet you didn'’t live

12:22.872 --> 12:25.657
across the street from a Target.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.312
Bums fight in the parking lot
all night.

12:28.399 --> 12:31.272
Ooh! Who needs cable?

12:34.057 --> 12:36.799
So the job'’s kicking
your ass, huh?

12:36.886 --> 12:37.887
[sighs wearily]

12:37.974 --> 12:39.410
Last night, after we closed,

12:39.497 --> 12:41.412
I went up to the office,

12:41.499 --> 12:44.154
got under the desk and cried.

12:44.241 --> 12:47.854
Did you see where I carved
my initials in there?

12:47.941 --> 12:49.551
I did.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.944
It'’s what gave me the idea

12:51.031 --> 12:53.555
to ask you for help.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.600
I bet you wish you
could drink, hmm?

12:55.687 --> 12:59.039
[burps]

12:59.126 --> 13:02.477
It'’s not as appealing
as you might think.

13:02.564 --> 13:03.826
So, what do you need?

13:03.913 --> 13:06.481
[sighs]
I...

13:06.568 --> 13:07.961
I don'’t know
what I'’m doing wrong.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.963
I... I'’m being
nice to everybody.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.878
The kitchen staff, the vendors.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.488
I-I say please,
I say thanks.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.055
I never raise my voice.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.360
That'’s your problem.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.622
What do you mean?

13:17.709 --> 13:19.059
You'’re a people pleaser.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.190
You want to be their friend.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.844
That'’s never gonna work.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.498
To run a restaurant,
the customers have to see

13:23.585 --> 13:25.195
Mary Poppins and everybody else

13:25.282 --> 13:27.589
has to see Benito Mussolini.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.899
Couldn'’t I be Benito Poppins?

13:32.986 --> 13:35.031
Nope.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.859
You were always nice to me.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.382
And did you respect me?

13:38.469 --> 13:41.864
Okay, I see where you'’re going.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.390
I'’m sorry, I...

13:46.477 --> 13:48.740
I'’ve been so caught up
in trying to do my job,

13:48.828 --> 13:51.004
I didn'’t even ask you
how you'’re doing.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.484
You care?Course I care.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.139
I mean, you and I have...

13:56.226 --> 13:57.488
history.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.273
Thanks.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.231
That means a lot to me.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.885
And to answer your question,

14:02.972 --> 14:04.191
I don'’t know how I'’m doing.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.845
At times, I'’m relieved

14:05.932 --> 14:07.063
I'’m out of a horrible marriage

14:07.150 --> 14:08.412
and a job that I hated.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.110
And at other times...

14:10.197 --> 14:12.721
I'’m sober.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.383
Ooh! Shower time.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.562
[knocking on door]

14:35.831 --> 14:37.877
I know you'’re
in there, Plunkett!

14:40.357 --> 14:42.620
Hiya, Bev.
What can I do for you?

14:42.707 --> 14:44.709
The window latch that you fixed
with Scotch tape

14:44.796 --> 14:46.929
broke again and my cat got out.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.410
"Got out" or ran away from you?

14:51.629 --> 14:53.718
I just want you to know
that I'’m passing around

14:53.805 --> 14:55.633
a petition to have you
kicked out of this building.

14:55.720 --> 14:56.591
Nobody'’s gonna sign it.

14:56.678 --> 14:58.419
I'’m beloved here.

14:58.506 --> 14:59.724
Oh, really?

14:59.811 --> 15:02.727
I got 38 signatures in an hour.

15:03.859 --> 15:06.340
Mind if I take a look at that?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.560
Thank you.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.090
It'’s a copy.

15:22.443 --> 15:25.576
Well, then, thanks
for stopping by.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.322
CHRISTY: Yo, we need
bus trays on the floor!

15:32.409 --> 15:33.976
Table two needs bread!

15:34.063 --> 15:35.760
Hey, pretty boy!

15:35.847 --> 15:38.676
You got time to lean,
you got time to clean.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.635
Need your signature over here.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.768
Oh, you do, huh?

15:43.855 --> 15:44.900
You call this fennel?

15:44.987 --> 15:48.164
I call it crap.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.297
That actually looks pretty good.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.954
Well... [clears throat]
I got the fennel part right.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.653
Hey!

15:58.740 --> 16:00.350
Tonight'’s special doesn'’t come
with a side of hair.

16:00.437 --> 16:01.656
Bun it up, blondie.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.745
Christy, a word?

16:03.832 --> 16:05.529
Yeah, boss?I'’ve been getting
a lot of complaints

16:05.616 --> 16:06.878
from the staff
about you today.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.228
Oh, God, I'’m sorry.
I was just...

16:08.315 --> 16:09.229
No, no!

16:09.316 --> 16:10.534
Don'’t apologize.

16:10.621 --> 16:11.535
Keep doing what you'’re doing.

16:11.622 --> 16:12.580
Love it.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.887
Hola,Christy.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.019
Hang on, Ramone.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.542
[sniffing]

16:18.629 --> 16:20.457
Have you been smoking
pot in the bathroom?

16:20.544 --> 16:22.024
No.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.373
Ramone...

16:23.460 --> 16:25.506
Un poco.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.290
I am only gonna say this once:

16:27.377 --> 16:29.031
You want to keep this job,

16:29.118 --> 16:30.815
you get loaded before
you come to work.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.426
Like I used to.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.430
How about that?

16:36.517 --> 16:39.085
I found my thing.

16:39.172 --> 16:42.175
All we need is
a few more signatures

16:42.262 --> 16:44.046
so we can go
to the building owner

16:44.133 --> 16:45.917
and have Plunkett fired.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.354
[all cheer in agreement]

16:47.441 --> 16:48.920
Sorry to, uh, interrupt,

16:49.008 --> 16:51.358
but I heard we had
a rat problem down here.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.883
What brings you around?

16:54.970 --> 16:57.668
It'’s certainly not
to fix the ceiling fan.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.192
[all laugh]

17:01.368 --> 17:04.762
It is not.

17:04.848 --> 17:07.896
Why don'’t you just admit you
have no idea how to do this job?

17:07.983 --> 17:10.203
Fine. I admit it.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.726
Is that what you want to hear?

17:11.813 --> 17:14.250
I am trying my best.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.383
I still have a lot to learn.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.037
I'’m a flawed human being!

17:18.124 --> 17:19.473
But aren'’t we all?

17:21.127 --> 17:22.214
Really?

17:22.301 --> 17:23.825
Everyone here is perfect?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.349
Do I need to remind you
that I have

17:27.436 --> 17:29.526
the keys to all your apartments?

17:29.613 --> 17:30.788
That'’s right.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.226
I have access to all your homes.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.750
And all your secrets.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.318
Where you going, Mr. Wilkerson?

17:38.405 --> 17:41.538
To put on a dress?

17:41.625 --> 17:44.324
I guess he won'’t be signing
your little petition.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.239
Who else wants to get rid of me?

17:48.154 --> 17:49.851
Certainly not the young lady
on the second floor

17:49.938 --> 17:52.593
who has a Web series
that takes place in her shower.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.860
Or the quiet, shy fella
in the corner apartment

17:58.947 --> 18:02.255
who likes to make love
to a warm pumpkin.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.041
You see where I'’m going
with this?

18:06.128 --> 18:07.521
If I go down,

18:07.608 --> 18:09.697
you all go down.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.133
You'’re bluffing!

18:11.220 --> 18:13.004
Oh, really?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.268
[whispers]

18:15.355 --> 18:16.530
I say we keep her!

18:19.402 --> 18:21.622
All right, meeting adjourned.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.451
What do you say, Bev?

18:24.538 --> 18:25.974
No hard feelings?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.845
Nah, I guess not.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.630
Come here, let'’s hug it out.

18:31.893 --> 18:34.417
No one will ever
publish your poetry.

18:39.640 --> 18:43.122
Everyone at work hates me.

18:46.603 --> 18:49.432
And now I hate me.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.572
Okay, I'’ll be sure she gets it.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.665
This one'’s from
the lady in 2F.

19:04.752 --> 19:08.538
Just put it with the others.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.845
She'’s not really a lady.
