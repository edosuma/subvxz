WEBVTT

01:34.719 --> 01:36.428
Nighttime or daytime,

01:36.596 --> 01:40.307
once you get a few feet into this place,
you can't tell the difference.

01:40.475 --> 01:44.061
Probably why
it's all remained so untouched.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.688
One step at a time,
gentlemen. Keep your eyes peeled.

01:46.856 --> 01:49.733
Over this way, to your right, Coop.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.903
Harry, someone's been here already.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.656
Look, they did our work for us.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.158
Oh, my God.

02:03.206 --> 02:06.333
I saw the same tracks
outside the power station.

02:07.669 --> 02:11.964
Weight shift to the left foot.
A break in the heel.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.049
Windom Earle.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.093
What would Earle be doing here?

02:16.261 --> 02:19.888
That's a frightening question
to contemplate.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.267
Andy, I'm gonna need

02:23.434 --> 02:26.478
an accurate large-scale
rendering of this petroglyph.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.231
Harry, let's get Major Briggs
on the horn.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.941
You want him to meet us
at the station?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.901
That's the ticket.

02:48.585 --> 02:55.382
Once upon a time,
there was a place of great goodness

02:55.550 --> 02:58.343
called the White Lodge.

02:58.511 --> 03:03.640
Gentle fawns gamboled there
amidst happy, laughing spirits.

03:03.808 --> 03:07.895
The sounds of innocence and joy
filled the air.

03:08.062 --> 03:13.525
And when it rained, it rained
sweet nectar that infused one's heart

03:13.693 --> 03:18.947
with a desire to live life
in truth and beauty.

03:19.908 --> 03:25.412
Generally speaking, a ghastly place,
reeking of virtue's sour smell.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.372
Engorged with
the whispered prayers

03:27.540 --> 03:30.709
of kneeling mothers,
mewling newborns,

03:30.877 --> 03:35.005
and fools, young and old,
compelled to do good without reason.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.551
But I am happy to point out
that our story does not end

03:39.719 --> 03:43.096
in this wretched place
of saccharine excess.

03:43.264 --> 03:47.100
For there's another place.
Its opposite.

03:47.268 --> 03:50.687
A place of almost
unimaginable power,

03:50.855 --> 03:54.191
chock-full of dark forces
and vicious secrets.

03:55.568 --> 03:59.404
No prayers dare enter
this frightful maw.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.242
Spirits there care not for good deeds
or priestly invocations.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.410
They are as like
to rip the flesh from your bone

04:05.578 --> 04:07.996
as greet you with a happy good day.

04:08.164 --> 04:12.042
And if harnessed,
these spirits in this hidden land

04:12.210 --> 04:15.087
of unmuffled screams
and broken hearts

04:15.255 --> 04:17.923
will offer up a power so vast

04:18.091 --> 04:24.596
that its bearer might reorder
the earth itself to his liking.

04:24.764 --> 04:31.228
Now, this place I speak of
is known as the Black Lodge.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.106
And I intend to find it.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.275
Hey, man,

04:36.442 --> 04:38.193
the story's cool,

04:38.361 --> 04:40.779
but you promised me beer.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.906
You told me
there was gonna be a party.

04:43.074 --> 04:49.371
I mean, White Lodge, Black Lodge?
I mean, what's the big deal?

04:49.539 --> 04:54.668
In time, young man.
Everything in time.

05:19.027 --> 05:26.491
I think that I shall never see
a girl as lovely as Josie.

05:27.243 --> 05:30.329
When she walks into a room,

05:30.496 --> 05:34.666
the flowers all stood up,

05:35.376 --> 05:38.128
to room,

05:38.921 --> 05:41.173
doom,

05:41.341 --> 05:45.594
fume, gloom...

05:47.555 --> 05:51.933
I think that I shall never see
a girl as lovely as Josie.

05:52.101 --> 05:58.398
When she walks into a room,
the flowers were all abloom.

06:00.234 --> 06:03.528
- Oh, Josie.
- Oh, stop your incessant moping.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.447
Give me a hand with this damn box.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.702
What exactly
would you like me to do?

06:11.204 --> 06:14.748
Open it. I've been trying for days.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.167
Thomas Eckhardt
left this to me when he died.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.754
And I want it opened,
I want it opened now.

06:20.922 --> 06:24.049
Well, let's have a look-see here.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.592
Do you have a key?

06:26.427 --> 06:31.139
If I had a key, it would be open,
don't you think?

06:32.558 --> 06:36.645
Well, it doesn't even have
a keyhole.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.400
It's a puzzle box.

06:41.567 --> 06:46.571
I saw one of these
at a crafts emporium on Guam.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.992
I was there taking a little R and R
with the Doolittle twins. Heh.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.203
There was a monkey show
you wouldn't believe,

06:53.371 --> 06:57.165
and Dale Doolittle...
Now, he was the larger of the two...

06:57.333 --> 07:00.419
Come to think of it, for twins,
they weren't all that much alike.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.671
Peter!

07:04.132 --> 07:05.841
Sorry, poodle.

07:06.050 --> 07:11.721
The trick is to fit the pieces together
just so.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.433
And how long will it take?

07:15.977 --> 07:20.021
Well, this could take years.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.696
Shel, I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the future.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.991
And what it takes
to get ahead in the world.

07:31.159 --> 07:35.745
I'm reading up, watching TV,
suddenly it hits me: boom.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.498
The secret to success.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.127
Beautiful people
get everything they want.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.588
- Oh, Bobby.
- Yeah, think about it.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.215
When's the last time you saw
a beautiful blond

07:47.383 --> 07:49.926
go to the electric chair?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.511
Eh...

07:51.679 --> 07:54.639
You are very beautiful, Shelly.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.936
And I think it's time we took advantage
of this beautiful people's conspiracy.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.772
Know any senators I can marry?

08:03.399 --> 08:04.900
Check it out.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.153
Miss Twin Peaks.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.990
Once we get that crown on your head,
baby, the sky is the limit.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.243
Dream on, Bobby,
I have tables to wait on.

08:15.411 --> 08:18.121
Shelly, listen, don't argue with me.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.249
Bobby's in charge,
you understand?

08:23.294 --> 08:25.170
We have to enlist
by this afternoon.

08:33.262 --> 08:38.475
There's, uh, something
I want you to do for me, darling.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.104
I'll do anything
that body and mind can stand.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.068
Surely the last few days
have been proof of that, eh?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.195
- Oh.
- Heh.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.365
You just name it.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.243
Um...

08:57.161 --> 08:59.704
I wanna win
the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.665
You just name it.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.420
I wanna win
the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.215
Oh, of course.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.426
Well, I've been known to make
a speech or two in my time. Heh.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.012
I'll coach you day and night.

09:16.472 --> 09:20.642
Oh, now, sweetheart.
Baby, that's not what I'm talking about.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.478
Now, you're one of the judges.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.355
You can guarantee it.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.026
But... But, uh...

09:30.736 --> 09:32.279
It would be wrong.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.490
Well, now, darling...

09:35.658 --> 09:37.784
Darling, it would be love.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.953
That's all.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.374
You know,
I'd do anything for you, Lana.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.751
You know that.

09:47.378 --> 09:51.256
Yes, lover, I do.

09:58.889 --> 10:02.767
- Good morning, Annie.
- Hi. Breakfast?

10:02.977 --> 10:05.645
I've got four hungry lawmen
out in the police cruiser.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.690
We need donuts and coffee. Hot.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.234
Two black, two white,
no sugars, please.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.487
- Coming right up.
- Oh, and Annie?

10:15.781 --> 10:17.532
I'd like to take this opportunity
to ask you

10:17.700 --> 10:20.327
if you'd like to accompany me
on a nature study this afternoon?

10:21.829 --> 10:23.872
Nature study?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.790
Sure.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.418
How wonderful.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.378
What?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.006
When I talk to you,
I get a tingling sensation

10:33.174 --> 10:35.091
in my toes and in my stomach.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.135
That's interesting.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.055
I don't think
it has anything to do with coffee.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.059
- I'll get those donuts.
- Thanks.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.150
Shelly?

10:52.318 --> 10:55.278
You are beautiful, got it?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.822
Use it to your advantage.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.494
"What is all this sweet work worth,

11:02.703 --> 11:05.038
if thou kiss not me?"

11:05.206 --> 11:06.456
I beg your pardon?

11:08.709 --> 11:11.586
Oh, it was an anonymous poem
someone sent me.

11:11.754 --> 11:15.465
Shelly,
I need to see this poem immediately.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.301
Okay.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.681
It was in three pieces,
we each got a piece.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.350
- Donna, Audrey and me.
- Thank you.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.191
I need to keep this.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.444
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:37.863 --> 11:41.157
A dozen donuts, four cups of coffee,
two black, two white, no sugar.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.076
Thank you.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.121
- Agent Cooper?
- Yes.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.124
Uh, this afternoon?

11:49.709 --> 11:53.294
I'll meet you right here.
Four o'clock sharp.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.727
"Mountains kiss.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.312
Waves clasp.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.815
Flower..."

12:13.983 --> 12:16.109
What's this all about?

12:16.736 --> 12:19.904
It's a poem, Harry. Torn into thirds.

12:20.072 --> 12:24.576
Sent to Shelly Johnson, Audrey Horne
and Donna Hayward

12:24.744 --> 12:26.077
from Windom Earle.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.872
You mean Earle's contacted
all three girls?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.208
Are you sure?

12:33.586 --> 12:38.548
See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another

12:38.716 --> 12:43.720
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother

12:44.847 --> 12:47.056
A poem I once sent to Caroline.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.894
I hope it's nothing more
than a taunt, Harry.

12:51.437 --> 12:56.149
Earle takes perverse pride in his ability
to insinuate himself into innocent lives.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.110
Well, let's talk to the girls
as soon as we can.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.737
See what they remember.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.452
Donna Hayward's poem.

13:10.873 --> 13:14.042
Audrey Horne is in Seattle.
She won't be back till tomorrow.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.920
Major Briggs is here
in the conference room.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.671
Hawk?

13:19.882 --> 13:24.219
Would you please bring me
Leo Johnson's arrest report?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.555
Leo?

13:28.724 --> 13:30.099
What's going on?

13:32.353 --> 13:35.355
Putting the pieces together, Harry.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.607
Deputy Brennan?

13:37.775 --> 13:40.068
As I remember,
the line you are drawing

13:40.236 --> 13:42.403
should proceed downward,
not across.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.197
How did you know that?

13:45.574 --> 13:49.077
Major Briggs?
Thank you, sir, for coming in.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.498
Major, we need your help.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.377
But I am unable to accurately
describe for you how or why.

13:57.753 --> 13:59.170
Go on.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.548
The Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department
is currently involved

14:01.715 --> 14:03.591
in several disparate investigations.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.011
The disappearance
of known felon, Leo Johnson.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.638
The appearance
of my former partner

14:08.806 --> 14:11.015
and suspected murderer,
Windom Earle.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.351
And the discovery of petroglyphs
of an unknown origin

14:13.519 --> 14:14.686
in a place called Owl Cave.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.855
Now, it would seem
logic would dictate

14:17.022 --> 14:20.191
that these investigations
be considered separate entities.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.360
However, I believe otherwise.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.863
I believe that these mysteries
are not separate entities,

14:25.030 --> 14:27.991
but are in fact, complementary verses
of the same song.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.618
Now, I cannot hear it yet.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.495
But I can feel it.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.163
And that is enough
for me to proceed.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.291
How exactly may I help you?

14:37.167 --> 14:39.294
I need to know everything
that there is to know

14:39.461 --> 14:42.672
about Windom Earle's work
with Project Blue Book.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.884
My security clearance was revoked
shortly after my disappearance.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.220
And your ability to access
these Blue Book files?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.390
Now, the issue is not one of access.

14:53.058 --> 14:58.313
However, there are certain
moral judgments I must consider.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.566
Yes, sir, I understand.

15:01.942 --> 15:06.279
Will this information help you
to prevent future loss of life?

15:06.488 --> 15:07.864
Most assuredly.

15:10.701 --> 15:14.787
Is this a copy of the petroglyph
you found in Owl Cave?

15:15.789 --> 15:17.540
Andy?

15:17.708 --> 15:19.167
Sir.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.336
Are you familiar with this?

15:21.795 --> 15:23.755
Well, I've dreamed it.

15:24.340 --> 15:28.259
Or seen it somewhere, somehow.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.618
I will do what you ask.

15:56.372 --> 16:00.375
- Leo Johnson's arrest report.
- Good work, Hawk.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.547
Gentlemen,
the damage to Leo Johnson

16:06.715 --> 16:09.759
would alter
certain handwriting characteristics.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.012
However, the basic style
would remain the same.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.068
This poem,

16:27.236 --> 16:32.115
sent by Windom Earle,
was transcribed by Leo Johnson.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.167
Mr. Horne.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.172
Mr. Horne, as you are no doubt aware,
there are but scant hours

16:48.340 --> 16:50.216
until our wine-tasting benefit begins

16:50.384 --> 16:53.219
and I can't find
your daughter anywhere.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.264
Hmm.
Audrey is in Seattle for the day.

16:56.473 --> 17:01.144
However, I'm sure that our concierge
will, uh, be able to assist you.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.895
- The concierge.
- Mm.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.480
Heh, yes, capital.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.816
- Thank you, Mr. Horne.
- Mm-hm.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.443
Oh, uh, Mr., uh...

17:08.861 --> 17:11.195
- Richard Tremayne.
- Tremayne, yes, right.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.406
- Men's fashions.
- Men's fashions, of course.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.907
Tell me, um,

17:15.784 --> 17:18.286
how is your, uh, nose?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.329
Oh, Mr. Horne, think nothing of it.

17:20.497 --> 17:25.209
A nose is a small price to pay
in the service of a greater good.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.878
Uh-huh.

17:27.046 --> 17:31.007
Well, we will, of course,
pay, uh, any medical expenses.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.718
How kind.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.513
One might also think
workers' compensation

17:37.681 --> 17:40.933
in some variety will be involved.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.646
Easily done.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.941
Capital, Mr. Horne.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.526
I'll alert my attorney.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.159
"I will alert my attorney."

17:59.703 --> 18:03.998
Sometimes the urge to do bad

18:04.166 --> 18:07.085
is nearly overpowering.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.934
Drink up, my friend. We celebrate.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.397
Celebrate?
I can barely move my arms. Heh.

18:30.484 --> 18:34.445
You have lived your short life
in odium and obscurity.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.156
But now, at the last,

18:37.324 --> 18:40.159
you will step upon the larger stage.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.994
I must confess, I envy you.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.623
Your journey begins
at a point beyond imagining.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.376
Who knows where it might travel
from there, huh?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.294
I'm pumped.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.047
Hey, is this for, like,
the Lilac Parade or what?

18:54.675 --> 18:57.385
Uh, no, uh, not a parade, my friend,
not exactly.

18:57.553 --> 19:01.305
Well, I'm real cool about helping out
and everything, but, um,

19:01.515 --> 19:03.808
how do I get out of this thing? Heh.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.935
You don't.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.979
Leo?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.690
Fetch me an arrow.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.777
Arrow?

19:15.404 --> 19:18.197
Whoa, man. Heh.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.409
I do not appreciate practical jokes.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.872
Leo, the arrow?

19:28.625 --> 19:30.084
No.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.133
Jeez, don't zap the geek.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.719
How am I supposed to get
my beer without...? You know.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.348
Dude. That hurts.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.771
Fetch me the arrow.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.831
Thank you, Leo.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.713
What's with the arrow, man?

20:16.757 --> 20:18.674
What are you doing?

20:19.134 --> 20:22.261
- This isn't funny.
- Shh, shh.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.556
- Be still.
- Well, what the hell are you doing?

20:27.476 --> 20:28.935
Think of all the hapless sinners

20:29.102 --> 20:32.188
wondering where
their souls' destination lies.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.440
For what?

20:34.650 --> 20:37.109
To gain the answer
to a simple question.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.614
Where will my spirit awake?

20:42.115 --> 20:45.868
What life am I given after this life?

20:48.789 --> 20:53.626
This grave question has plagued
man's sorry conscience for eons.

20:53.794 --> 20:57.171
And now, you, you lucky boy.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.341
You have the answer.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.301
Now.

21:13.063 --> 21:16.399
Miss Twin Peaks Judging and Rules
Committee is now in session.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.652
You know, this year
is going to be very exciting.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.781
- Now we...
- Very exciting.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.325
This year is going to be
very, very exciting.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.952
Thank you, Dwayne.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.912
Now, first order of business.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.331
Mr. Ben Horne has asked
to address the committee

21:32.499 --> 21:34.041
as a friend of the committee.

21:34.209 --> 21:37.295
I don't have any objection to that.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.006
Address away, Ben.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.799
Thank you.

21:42.634 --> 21:47.555
And, Dwayne, uh, let me congratulate
you on your, uh, recent engagement.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.391
Oh. Thank you very much.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.853
She's a lovely woman
and I wish you much happiness.

21:54.021 --> 21:57.148
Well, thank you very much.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.776
Ahem. Gentlemen.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.321
My purpose is simple.

22:03.488 --> 22:09.410
The age of the ogling, swim-suited
jiggle festivals of the past is dead.

22:09.953 --> 22:13.331
Miss Twin Peaks, I believe,
and rightly,

22:13.957 --> 22:19.837
is now a celebration
of the totality of a woman's qualities.

22:20.005 --> 22:23.007
Beauty has taken on
a broader definition

22:23.175 --> 22:28.429
to include mind, spirit, values, ideas.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.640
And for taking this step, gentlemen,

22:31.808 --> 22:33.059
I applaud you.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.521
What's he selling?
What are you selling?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.273
Mr. Mayor, let me get
right to the point.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.651
Miss Twin Peaks is an event
in search of a theme.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.737
Now, what I propose is simple.

22:44.905 --> 22:52.161
The topic of this year's speeches
should be how to save our forests.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.704
Hmm?

22:53.872 --> 22:59.752
It's now, it's relevant,
it's global and it's, um...

23:00.629 --> 23:04.090
Well, to put it plainly,
gentlemen, it's us.

23:05.717 --> 23:11.430
Of course, uh, your opposition
to the Ghostwood development plans

23:11.598 --> 23:13.849
wouldn't have anything
to do with this?

23:14.017 --> 23:19.605
Pete, I resent your implication.

23:19.773 --> 23:24.902
The environmental issues here
dwarf any parochial business concerns

23:25.070 --> 23:29.990
that I, or you, or anyone else

23:30.158 --> 23:31.909
might be pursuing.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.787
We'll, uh, take it under advisement.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.249
Ahem.
We'll take it under advisement.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.292
That's the most
that I could hope for.

23:40.460 --> 23:44.797
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.
Mr. Mayor.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.885
He thinks he can pull a fast one.

23:50.053 --> 23:53.931
The idea has merit.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.766
I'm in favor of it myself.

23:56.768 --> 24:00.020
- Ahem. Bobby.
- Hey, chief.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.897
Don't forget
the dry-cleaning, all right?

24:02.065 --> 24:04.108
Heh. Thanks.

24:11.867 --> 24:16.495
Uh, will the first candidate
please approach the committee?

24:16.663 --> 24:19.165
Lana? Come on up, honey.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.638
Uh, does anybody smell a fix here?

24:34.806 --> 24:37.558
I can't do this, Bobby.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.603
I have never made a speech before
in my life.

24:40.770 --> 24:43.772
I read a book report in the fourth grade
in front of Mrs. Gardner's class

24:43.940 --> 24:46.358
and I passed out
right in front of the whole room.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.820
You'll do great, doll.
I'm gonna be your speech writer.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.405
Oh. Heh.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.950
You're gonna be great.
Don't worry, okay?

24:58.788 --> 25:02.249
- Here you go. Good luck.
- Donna? Are you entering too?

25:02.417 --> 25:07.087
- Uh, yeah, you too?
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.798
- Isn't it exciting?
- Ha, ha. Yes.

25:09.966 --> 25:11.592
Yes.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.930
Mike, it's a long time no see.

25:16.097 --> 25:19.683
I'd ask where you've been
keeping yourself but I think I know.

25:19.851 --> 25:23.270
- This is very scary, Mike.
- It's not what you think.

25:23.438 --> 25:26.357
It's not what I think?
What do you think I think?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.484
You think I'm going out
with an older woman.

25:29.945 --> 25:34.990
I think I don't know where you got this
sudden interest in the life of fossils.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.117
Yeah, but...

25:37.285 --> 25:38.577
It's not what you think.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.540
Mike, big favor.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.959
Clear this up for me.

25:45.168 --> 25:47.670
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.381
I will strive to be understanding.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.469
Do you have any idea

25:55.637 --> 25:57.846
what a combination
of sexual maturity

25:58.014 --> 26:00.975
and superhuman strength
can result in?

26:07.816 --> 26:09.483
Whoa!

26:10.944 --> 26:13.362
Sorry. Whoa.

26:35.176 --> 26:39.847
Catherine, if there's anything
you can tell me about her, anything...

26:40.015 --> 26:43.100
Anything at all
that might help me understand.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.019
For instance?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.897
What made her do
the things she did?

26:49.065 --> 26:50.316
What was she after?

26:50.483 --> 26:55.029
Hmm. I've been asking myself
a lot of the same things.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.614
Catherine?

26:56.990 --> 26:59.199
I need to understand.

27:01.911 --> 27:04.663
I think that early in her life,
she must have learned the lesson

27:04.831 --> 27:09.877
that she could survive by being
what other people wanted to see,

27:10.045 --> 27:12.713
by showing them that.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.800
And whatever was left
of her private self,

27:16.968 --> 27:19.386
she may never have shown
to anyone.

27:19.554 --> 27:23.932
- So all the stories, the lies were...?
- Well, who knows?

27:24.142 --> 27:27.186
They may not have seemed
untrue to her.

27:29.230 --> 27:33.484
What she needed to believe was
always shifting to suit the moment.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.530
In spite of all the things
she tried to do to me and my family,

27:38.698 --> 27:41.659
I find it curiously hard
to hate her for it.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.037
Well, she was...

27:45.246 --> 27:47.164
She was so very beautiful.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.250
Hmm.

27:56.216 --> 28:00.552
There may be a clue
that could benefit both of us.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.429
What's that?

28:05.934 --> 28:09.186
Thomas Eckhardt left this to me
when he died.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.147
It occurred to me that it might have
something to do with Josie.

28:12.315 --> 28:13.732
What's inside?

28:13.942 --> 28:17.194
I don't know.
I haven't been able to open it.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.029
Let me see.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.867
- Well, there's no lid, there's...
- No.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.037
There's no clasp.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.081
Wowee, Bob.

28:29.290 --> 28:34.002
Have we got some beauties
in the contest this year.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.212
Hello, Harry.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.299
Seems like every gal in town
is lined up to take a shot at the...

28:39.467 --> 28:43.846
Say, have you had any luck
with this thing?

28:44.097 --> 28:46.515
- Oh!
- Butterfingers.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.983
Holy moly.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.818
What is it?

29:06.536 --> 29:10.289
- Give it to me.
- Just a second, poodle.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.960
Ah!

29:18.590 --> 29:22.509
Now, I held it just so.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.160
I used to swim here every summer.
Two or three times a week.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.289
Then I made a good choice.
It's beautiful.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.210
I always felt closer to nature
than I did to people.

29:56.377 --> 29:59.880
- Why?
- I never had many friends.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.508
Norma was always Miss Popularity.

30:02.675 --> 30:04.760
She was always moving
toward the world.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.470
And I was always
moving away from it.

30:06.679 --> 30:10.349
- Lived in my head, mostly.
- That's not a bad neighborhood.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.726
There's some pretty strange
neighbors.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.606
- Many boyfriends?
- No.

30:17.774 --> 30:18.816
Really?

30:19.943 --> 30:21.860
Well, I had one.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.278
High school?

30:23.446 --> 30:24.571
Senior year.

30:26.741 --> 30:29.576
Have anything to do
with why you went into the convent?

30:32.580 --> 30:34.748
I'm sorry, do you mind
if we don't talk about it?

30:36.000 --> 30:39.670
Not at all.
We can talk about whatever you'd like.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.757
I wanna come back to the world.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.843
I was so frightened for so long.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.512
I understand.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.932
Hiding from your fear
doesn't make your fear go away.

30:53.476 --> 30:55.644
Makes it stronger.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.732
So I had to face it.
I had to face myself.

31:00.900 --> 31:04.611
And I had to do it here.
Where everything went so wrong.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.918
Annie, I know how hopeless
things can seem.

31:22.046 --> 31:25.674
I know about the dark tunnel
you can fall into.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.217
It happened before I went away.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.262
It happened because of that boy.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.559
Something similar happened to me.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.895
It made me wanna disappear
from the world.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.357
Because of that,
maybe I can help you.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.915
- I don't know you very well.
- No.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.835
I'm trying to learn
how to trust my instincts.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.797
What are they saying?

32:08.343 --> 32:10.218
Trust.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.662
Good evening. Evening, all.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.332
And welcome
to our oenophiliac soiree.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.335
Another in a continuing series
of public events,

33:25.503 --> 33:27.629
sponsored by Horne Industries,

33:27.797 --> 33:32.884
to benefit the Stop Ghostwood
Development movement.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.178
Ono-what?

33:35.346 --> 33:38.849
- Something to do with wine.
- And now,

33:39.183 --> 33:41.101
to the tasting.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.938
Lana, Lucy,

33:45.106 --> 33:47.983
if you'd like to help me pour, please.

33:58.161 --> 34:02.414
Our first wines this evening
are reds.

34:02.582 --> 34:06.084
There are some schools of thought
who, of course, say,

34:06.252 --> 34:09.337
there are no other wines
but reds. Heh.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.173
Yes, Andy?

34:11.340 --> 34:16.595
There are also white wines
and sparkling wines.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.723
Thank you, Andy.

34:19.891 --> 34:23.351
And now that we're all poured,
let us first examine...

34:23.519 --> 34:25.520
Don't taste it yet, Andy,
for heaven's sake.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.147
Spit it out.

34:30.651 --> 34:31.902
Sorry.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.780
That's all right.

34:35.490 --> 34:38.075
That's what we're here for, to learn.

34:38.785 --> 34:40.702
Now, to the wine.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.456
We must first examine
the nose of the wine

34:44.624 --> 34:47.709
to see what it can tell us
about its bouquet.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.545
And we do that by...

34:51.047 --> 34:53.298
By smelling.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.594
Very good, Lana.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.098
Hmph.

35:03.184 --> 35:07.270
Lift the glass, thusly.

35:07.438 --> 35:10.565
And while rolling the wine
vigorously around in the glass,

35:10.733 --> 35:15.445
we breathe deeply and fully.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.121
Very good.

35:24.288 --> 35:30.836
And now, we take our first taste,
a big, boisterous gulp.

35:31.045 --> 35:33.505
And we roll it around
our entire palate.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.881
And we try to reach

35:35.091 --> 35:39.678
those little taste buds stuck
way far at the back of the tongue,

35:39.887 --> 35:42.013
remembering not to swallow.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.015
Excellent.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.228
And now, we spit.

35:52.900 --> 35:56.945
So he came slowly out of the shadows,
leaving the dead girl behind.

35:57.113 --> 36:01.241
And I said, "You take one more step
and I will ventilate you."

36:01.409 --> 36:02.742
And then what happened?

36:02.910 --> 36:04.911
It was a brief, but touching funeral.

36:07.748 --> 36:10.167
Dale, glad I caught up with you.

36:10.376 --> 36:13.170
Got the rental fired up outside
and about ready to hit the road.

36:13.337 --> 36:16.214
Gordon, super
we caught you before you left.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.508
- You hurry back.
- I will, Coop.

36:19.218 --> 36:21.178
- Remember Annie?
- Of course I do.

36:21.345 --> 36:25.056
This world of Twin Peaks seems
to be filled with beautiful women.

36:25.224 --> 36:27.517
Although only one I can hear.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.187
Join us for pie.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.564
Love to.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.152
- Annie?
- Thanks.

36:42.825 --> 36:44.743
Three each.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.788
- Shelly, do you mind if we share?
- No.

36:48.956 --> 36:52.000
Coop, they say that love
makes the world go around.

36:52.168 --> 36:56.087
Makes people who need people
the luckiest people in the world.

36:56.255 --> 37:00.926
Although they never said a doggoned
thing about a cure for hearing loss.

37:01.093 --> 37:03.929
Shelly, you are a miracle worker.

37:04.138 --> 37:07.349
And a goddess sent from heaven.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.892
I'm a waitress in a diner.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.228
I've never been compared
to a goddess before.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.605
Well, Shelly,
you just don't know your own value.

37:13.773 --> 37:18.485
Coop, she's a rare and precious
individual, don't you think?

37:18.653 --> 37:19.903
I know what you mean, Gordon.

37:20.571 --> 37:26.159
Shelly, turn around and face me
a moment before I lose my nerve.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.370
I'm about ready
to leave Twin Peaks,

37:28.579 --> 37:31.081
and I don't know
when I'm gonna return.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.791
But I want you to know
that meeting you

37:32.959 --> 37:34.459
has been more than a privilege.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.795
It's touched my heart.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.881
And I know
that if I don't kiss you now,

37:40.091 --> 37:42.842
I'm gonna regret it
the rest of my days.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.596
Hey!

37:49.350 --> 37:50.725
What the hell's going on?

37:50.935 --> 37:53.895
You are a witnessing a front,
three-quarter view

37:54.063 --> 37:56.606
of two adults
sharing a tender moment.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.484
Acts like he's never seen
a kiss before.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.405
Uh, Gordon?

38:03.572 --> 38:07.367
Take another look, sonny,
it's gonna happen again.

38:12.790 --> 38:16.918
All right, class,
what did that sip reveal for us?

38:17.086 --> 38:19.421
What flavors are we enjoying?

38:20.756 --> 38:22.966
Tastes kind of woody.

38:23.426 --> 38:26.511
No, not really.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.472
Anyone else? Lana?

38:30.349 --> 38:31.558
Um...

38:32.810 --> 38:35.312
- Banana?
- Yes.

38:35.479 --> 38:39.190
There is a hint of banana.
That's the metachloric acid.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.525
Very good.

38:41.902 --> 38:45.071
- What else?
- Banana.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.656
Chocolate.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.575
Correct, Andy.

38:48.784 --> 38:52.329
Why don't we just skip the wine
and have a banana split?

38:55.499 --> 38:57.542
Let's take another sip, shall we?

38:57.710 --> 39:02.464
Swallowing this time,
and see what else we can discern.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.802
What else can we taste?

39:07.970 --> 39:10.930
What other wonder
invites taste buds toward pleasure?

39:11.098 --> 39:12.599
Gosh, Dick.

39:12.767 --> 39:17.812
Well, I just never knew wine
could have so many different qualities.

39:17.980 --> 39:21.524
It's amazing, isn't it?
A really good wine is like a symphony.

39:25.571 --> 39:30.367
And what is your reaction, Lucy?

39:34.747 --> 39:39.334
I'm pregnant.
I'm not supposed to drink.

40:04.193 --> 40:06.027
Love is hell.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.114
Sorry?

40:09.281 --> 40:12.033
Love, it's hell.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.038
The Hindus say
love is a ladder to heaven.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.168
The Hindus have also been known
to take hikes on hot coals

40:22.336 --> 40:24.254
for recreational purposes.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.131
Self-discipline.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.175
Self-discipline and love?
There's a bad match.

40:29.343 --> 40:31.010
Earthly love.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.762
What other kind is there?

40:32.930 --> 40:34.389
When you're in it,

40:34.598 --> 40:36.015
no other.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.686
It hits you like an 18-wheeler,
doesn't it? And there's no relief.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.146
It makes you feel more alive.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.565
It makes you feel more
of everything.

40:43.732 --> 40:44.858
Pain included.

40:45.818 --> 40:48.278
Especially pain.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.491
I can't stop thinking about her.

40:53.659 --> 40:55.660
Sounds like
you've got a pretty serious case.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.121
Brother, I'm roped,
tied and branded.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.998
She feel the same way?

41:01.208 --> 41:02.292
Here's hoping.

41:04.628 --> 41:08.256
How about you?
You on the critical list too?

41:09.341 --> 41:12.594
Feels like someone's taking
a crowbar to my heart.

41:12.761 --> 41:14.679
Hey, that's not bad.

41:14.847 --> 41:18.808
No, I think it's been locked away
long enough.

41:19.393 --> 41:21.144
That's good.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.188
- Here's hoping.
- Here's to you.

41:26.025 --> 41:30.320
- Mr. Wheeler? Telegram for you, sir.
- Thank you.

41:33.073 --> 41:35.074
Thank you very much.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.624
Damn.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.627
- Bellman?
- Yes, sir.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.754
Kindly tell the front desk
I'll be checking out.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.256
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.134
See you.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.887
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.990
Would you pass the peas, Donna?

42:16.909 --> 42:18.660
Thanks.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.954
- Mom, could I ask you something?
- Sure.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.331
How do you know Benjamin Horne?

42:23.499 --> 42:25.708
Uh, Eileen, I told, uh, Donna

42:25.876 --> 42:29.712
about the Heal the Planet benefit
you're working on.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.464
Heal the Planet?

42:31.674 --> 42:33.967
I saw him at the house.

42:34.134 --> 42:36.261
You drove to see him yesterday?

42:37.638 --> 42:41.641
Oh. Yes, he's offered to give us
some time.

42:42.893 --> 42:45.228
I know he favors
several local charities.

42:45.396 --> 42:46.771
Well, that must have been it.

42:46.939 --> 42:50.191
One of the local charities
must have sent Mom's roses.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.362
Uh, would you pass the peas,
Donna?

42:54.572 --> 42:57.824
I think roses are really romantic,
don't you?

42:57.992 --> 43:01.202
Donna, pass your mother the peas.

43:09.086 --> 43:10.378
How's school going?

43:11.088 --> 43:12.672
Great.

43:13.882 --> 43:17.594
All the girls are real excited
about Miss Twin Peaks.

43:17.761 --> 43:20.680
Fine tradition.
I worked with the pageant for years.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.390
I entered.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.560
Really?

43:25.769 --> 43:28.605
You never seemed
very interested before.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.273
Well, I guess I just figured

43:30.441 --> 43:33.526
I could use the scholarship money
to study overseas.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.395
We thought at first
it might be a bomb.

44:09.563 --> 44:13.733
We don't exactly have a bomb squad,
so Andy brought his metal detector.

44:13.901 --> 44:16.986
If it is a bomb, it's not metallic
and there's no ticking sound.

44:20.991 --> 44:24.035
Harry, there was a time
when I could comprehend,

44:24.203 --> 44:27.830
with a high degree of clarity,
Windom Earle's twisted logic.

44:27.998 --> 44:31.709
But his actions of late
have left me completely bewildered.

44:31.877 --> 44:34.962
He is changing the pattern
of the game board.

44:35.130 --> 44:39.008
Any hope of deducing his next move
has evaporated.

44:39.176 --> 44:41.552
Andy, would you please
direct everyone

44:41.720 --> 44:44.389
well behind the police cruiser?

44:46.308 --> 44:47.767
Harry, please stand back.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.644
There could be plastic explosives
in there...

44:49.812 --> 44:52.063
Agent Cooper wants everyone
back behind the cruiser.

44:52.231 --> 44:54.065
- chemicals,

44:54.233 --> 44:56.859
and whatever else
hell could imagine.

44:57.653 --> 44:59.612
My greatest fear?

45:01.407 --> 45:04.659
Windom Earle
merely condescends to logic.

45:05.786 --> 45:11.040
Leaving us the task of unraveling
an insane man's terrifying caprice.
