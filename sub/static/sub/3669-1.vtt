Then, our family moved to Ulsan.

over taking Yangsan Temple.

Just a couple young fools
tagging along.

Thank you, sir!

24:01.660 --> 24:03.570
Goodnight, sir!

24:03.700 --> 24:05.100
When will he get the picture?

24:05.940 --> 24:08.300
Heard how he talks to me?

24:08.870 --> 24:12.640
Boss Joon-suk made
many mistakes, sir.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.620
He's testing my patience.

24:25.190 --> 24:27.120
Goodnight, sir!

24:45.640 --> 24:46.900
Joon-suk!

24:48.510 --> 24:50.140
Sorry to make you come.

24:50.510 --> 24:51.570
Don't be.

24:52.110 --> 24:54.140
We open at night anyway.

24:54.350 --> 24:56.750
This is nothing compared to
how you looked after my son.

24:57.850 --> 25:00.650
Call me anytime you need a driver.

25:05.530 --> 25:08.400
I called and double checked.

25:09.130 --> 25:14.000
But who's SONG Ki-ho?

25:15.240 --> 25:19.140
We stood trial together.

25:23.850 --> 25:24.750
What?

25:26.250 --> 25:29.050
Want me to butcher
someone again?

25:30.320 --> 25:31.720
How long have you been here?

25:33.190 --> 25:34.820
Just go, sir.

25:35.990 --> 25:38.480
I gave up long ago.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.590
I didn't come
to ask you for a job.

25:44.930 --> 25:45.960
But...

25:49.970 --> 25:51.270
I'll ask one thing.

25:55.440 --> 25:56.610
Why'd you do it?

26:08.420 --> 26:12.490
I'm not sure either.

26:16.770 --> 26:17.860
Fine.

26:24.910 --> 26:28.170
Take good care of yourself.

26:32.820 --> 26:35.550
Guess he gave you
some money?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.290
When I came out
after 10 years...

26:43.460 --> 26:46.260
he just gave me dope.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.900
That's why I ended up like this.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.530
Eun-gi...

26:52.030 --> 26:57.230
I complained to the bastard
just once!

26:59.210 --> 27:01.110
Know what he did to me?

27:21.700 --> 27:22.690
Hello?

27:23.900 --> 27:24.890
Where are you?

27:28.340 --> 27:29.430
Sir Chairman.

27:35.140 --> 27:36.370
Now...

27:37.750 --> 27:40.980
I can't cherish memories
for much longer.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.710
You take 'em all.

27:45.290 --> 27:50.990
You wasted your youth away
because of me.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.220
No, sir.

27:55.130 --> 27:57.330
I followed you on my own, sir.

28:00.370 --> 28:03.170
Two weeks before
you got out...

28:04.140 --> 28:06.840
Eun-gi came to me.

28:08.780 --> 28:11.250
Said I should officially retire...

28:12.950 --> 28:17.350
and move to Jeju Island
for fresh air.

28:18.490 --> 28:19.420
So?

28:19.520 --> 28:21.010
Did you say you'll go?

28:22.290 --> 28:23.280
No.

28:24.490 --> 28:27.990
I said the air is fresh here.

28:29.030 --> 28:30.830
That bastard!

28:31.400 --> 28:33.160
Gangsters don't retire.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.230
There's nothing else to do.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.470
Right?

28:50.390 --> 28:51.650
Stay outside.

28:59.300 --> 29:04.560
Eun-gi keeps quiet and is smart.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.130
And he gets things done right.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.640
So I trusted him.

29:12.240 --> 29:19.270
After a year,
some boys started coming...

29:20.780 --> 29:25.550
saying who got killed
and disappeared.

29:27.820 --> 29:31.160
I later realized...

29:32.490 --> 29:35.690
my close boys like you
vanished off in order.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.330
Son of a bitch!

29:40.140 --> 29:44.870
He cut off my arms and legs
while I was hospitalized.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.340
What?

29:59.890 --> 30:01.620
Sir VP sent me, boss.

30:03.130 --> 30:06.820
It's a ticket for Thailand.

30:07.530 --> 30:11.300
You can leave anytime
within the month.

30:15.470 --> 30:16.300
Let's go.

30:24.550 --> 30:25.670
Take it.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.550
It has about 2 million.

30:33.490 --> 30:35.390
Should I spend this?

30:37.390 --> 30:38.950
Or use it to band up?

30:41.130 --> 30:42.720
These days...

30:43.900 --> 30:45.490

some cunning
Korean Japanese...

31:22.600 --> 31:25.800

to make cash.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.200
So, the fishermen...

31:28.440 --> 31:33.850
are illegally selling off goods
to Fukuoka gangs?

31:34.050 --> 31:35.380
Right!

31:35.750 --> 31:40.590
Things worth $1 at most here...

31:40.790 --> 31:44.990
could be worth 20 times that
in Japan.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.260

I lived like a dog all this time.

48:52.390 --> 48:56.350
Sir, if you don't plan to...

48:57.560 --> 48:58.750
I'll do it alone.

49:01.700 --> 49:03.060
I'll kill Eun-gi.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.210
You shitheads!

49:10.740 --> 49:12.600
Think I haven't got cash
to pay!

49:14.080 --> 49:16.340
Know how close I am
to Boss Joon-suk?

49:16.540 --> 49:19.610
I thought if I followed Big Boss,

49:19.880 --> 49:22.910
I'd be in the Busan Family.

49:23.650 --> 49:26.710
Why do you wanna be
one of us?

49:27.620 --> 49:30.090
Busan Gang rules in Korea!

49:31.930 --> 49:33.690
But it's dang hard.

49:34.060 --> 49:37.160
He doesn't know anything
and complains.

49:37.630 --> 49:39.790
Never pays me,
but says to get dope.

49:41.100 --> 49:44.770
Is he a fake LEE Joon-suk?

49:44.910 --> 49:46.600
Sung-hoon gets out
on the 10th?

49:47.310 --> 49:48.040
Yeah.

49:49.280 --> 49:52.870
Can we start up a hostess bar
in your name or Sung-hoon's?

49:53.780 --> 49:54.910
A hostess bar?

49:55.450 --> 49:57.440
I'll fund it.

50:00.220 --> 50:01.480
Sung-hoon!

50:05.290 --> 50:07.560
You poor thing!

50:08.700 --> 50:09.860
Try this!

50:11.500 --> 50:12.490
Back off!

50:14.240 --> 50:17.030
Sorry you took all the blame.

50:17.710 --> 50:18.870
Forget it, man.

50:24.380 --> 50:25.310
What's that?

50:25.810 --> 50:27.180
Know Joon-suk?

50:27.320 --> 50:29.980
Your friends said
you'd like this.

50:33.650 --> 50:35.250
The hell?

50:35.960 --> 50:36.950
You two dating?

50:38.030 --> 50:39.550
He's out!

50:40.490 --> 50:42.260
He flipped over it!

50:44.130 --> 50:49.970
He asked if you and me
are getting married.

50:51.770 --> 50:52.870
Don't know.

50:53.340 --> 50:55.210
Probably sensed something.

50:55.610 --> 50:57.580
Welcome!

50:58.250 --> 50:59.650
Welcome!

51:07.420 --> 51:09.480
Your mama got loaded!

51:17.060 --> 51:19.330
Laughing so much!

51:24.770 --> 51:26.140
Aren't ya drinking?

52:12.420 --> 52:17.220
If you force it in
and make a hole...

52:17.660 --> 52:20.090
what will it look like?

52:20.730 --> 52:22.060
What?

52:22.630 --> 52:24.620
Stiff!

52:24.730 --> 52:25.500
What?

52:25.930 --> 52:30.130
A stiff little hole!

52:32.370 --> 52:33.170
It's me.

52:33.270 --> 52:35.710
Joon-suk is living with a girl

52:35.840 --> 52:38.140
who runs a bar in Ulsan.

52:38.350 --> 52:39.370
Ulsan?

52:40.050 --> 52:41.480
Who's the girl?

52:41.880 --> 52:43.820
Someone from way back.

52:44.420 --> 52:45.680
But sir...

52:46.550 --> 52:48.550
She's got a helluva kid.

52:49.260 --> 52:53.390
He clashed with us a year ago
over a temple in Yangsan.

52:54.900 --> 52:57.690
The Ulsan kids, right?
I remember.

52:58.370 --> 52:59.360
Right, sir.

52:59.730 --> 53:05.540
I heard our boys tried to
do him in on the inside.

53:06.270 --> 53:08.110
But Joon-suk stopped it.

53:09.880 --> 53:10.900
Really?

53:11.950 --> 53:13.780
Is he in Chittagong's gang?

53:14.080 --> 53:15.050
No, sir.

53:15.820 --> 53:20.080
He's no gangster, sir.
Got just a little dike.

53:20.720 --> 53:21.850
And, sir...

53:22.760 --> 53:26.560
Is Joon-suk on dope?

53:30.330 --> 53:31.590
Did you spill?

53:32.630 --> 53:33.360
Yes, sir.

53:33.500 --> 53:35.560
I said you tell me to buy dope

53:36.500 --> 53:38.530
without paying me.

53:38.940 --> 53:40.670
I was damn mad, sir.

53:40.780 --> 53:42.800
No, I acted like it, sir.

53:44.010 --> 53:45.000
Good work.

53:50.620 --> 53:51.640
Here's 20 grand.

53:52.520 --> 53:53.680
You use half of it.

53:53.850 --> 53:58.120
Use the rest to buy the boys
beer and dope as needed.

53:58.490 --> 53:59.620
Round up the boys.

53:59.990 --> 54:01.260
Ask if you need more.

54:01.460 --> 54:02.950
Thank you, sir!

54:04.370 --> 54:05.700
What if...

54:06.700 --> 54:10.730
they suspect you
using money like crazy?

54:12.010 --> 54:15.880
I'll say Dad died
and I sold off everything.

54:16.680 --> 54:17.840
Did he really die?

54:18.280 --> 54:20.250
He's almost about to.

54:20.350 --> 54:23.810
He's practically gone
on Al-Qaeda disease, sir.

54:24.150 --> 54:25.050
What?

54:25.190 --> 54:27.310
The sickness that kills
your brain, sir.

54:30.460 --> 54:31.480
Let's do this.

54:32.860 --> 54:34.890
Say your father is very ill

54:35.060 --> 54:37.460
and you got his property rights.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.670
Great thinking, sir!

54:57.150 --> 55:00.750
Sorry to ask you to come
all the way to Ulsan.

55:01.460 --> 55:02.390
Don't be.

55:03.690 --> 55:05.850
Meeting in Busan
is out for us, too.

55:06.730 --> 55:09.160
Got to try
some whale meat.

55:17.870 --> 55:25.110
I expect this situation.
But if anyone dies,

55:26.810 --> 55:29.680
our hands are tied.

55:30.250 --> 55:31.180
Of course.

55:32.520 --> 55:33.510
I know.

55:38.260 --> 55:40.060
How about a drink?

55:40.460 --> 55:41.390
No need.

55:41.660 --> 55:43.760
I got early morning meetings.

55:45.500 --> 55:46.660
Stay here.

55:48.300 --> 55:53.370
No use having a cop and a gangster
being seen together.

56:04.020 --> 56:05.040
What?

56:19.770 --> 56:21.000
Finish it up.

56:23.700 --> 56:24.830
I'm full, sir.

56:25.540 --> 56:26.840
I ate till late.

56:29.040 --> 56:34.410
Know why gangsters always
ask each other if they ate?

56:35.680 --> 56:36.410
Why, sir?

56:37.750 --> 56:42.590
Cuz most of 'em struggle
and have it hard.

56:43.190 --> 56:44.620
Sometimes they can't eat.

56:45.960 --> 56:47.990
That sucks, doesn't it?

56:49.260 --> 56:50.090
Why?

56:50.730 --> 56:52.290
Don't care to live like that?

56:54.440 --> 56:59.640
You only live once.
A man should live it up.

57:05.980 --> 57:09.280
Then, wanna take
over Busan with me?

57:13.590 --> 57:14.580
Yes, sir.

57:15.160 --> 57:16.250
I'm not kidding.

57:16.820 --> 57:17.920
I'm not either.

57:26.400 --> 57:27.890
18,000 won in all.

57:29.900 --> 57:32.500
So, how many boys you got?

57:33.770 --> 57:36.400
Don't worry about 'em, sir.

57:36.640 --> 57:41.050
I know strong guys
in 3 different cities.

57:41.680 --> 57:44.410
Then, let's all get together
sometime and eat.

57:46.990 --> 57:48.890
Just give 'em cash, sir.

57:52.360 --> 57:55.450
No need to eat and drink.

57:55.530 --> 57:57.190
Just pay 'em and they'll work.

58:00.130 --> 58:01.570
Thank you, sir.

58:05.840 --> 58:10.680
You mean just pay 'em
and not try to be a family?

58:13.380 --> 58:17.750
Well, they gotta get paid
to wanna be a family.

58:23.290 --> 58:24.420
Thank you, sir.

58:30.360 --> 58:33.060
By the way...

58:34.030 --> 58:37.870
when we join forces
and take over Busan...

58:38.640 --> 58:41.940
who'll take charge?

58:46.450 --> 58:47.880
We'll see.

58:48.150 --> 58:51.810
If you got more boys
following you, you'll be.

58:51.990 --> 58:54.450
If there are more
following me, I'll be.

58:55.520 --> 58:57.220
Gotta have a gang
to be a leader.

58:59.590 --> 59:02.930
Then, it comes down
to money again.

59:09.600 --> 59:11.230
One more thing...

59:13.040 --> 59:13.800
What?

59:15.240 --> 59:19.680
Can I call you Big Boss?

59:21.520 --> 59:22.310
Sure.

59:23.250 --> 59:24.080
Yes.

59:28.920 --> 59:30.580
Why become blood brothers?

59:31.760 --> 59:32.520
Pardon?

59:33.760 --> 59:38.560
Why do boys band as one
like brothers?

59:41.370 --> 59:45.310
Well, cuz they do jobs
together...

59:45.540 --> 59:46.130
And?

59:47.810 --> 59:49.140
They grow up together...

59:49.240 --> 59:50.580
Cuz they starved together.

59:52.610 --> 59:54.140
Been on the run together.

59:55.120 --> 59:56.580
Almost died together!

59:57.120 --> 59:58.880
Sobbed aloud together!

59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.580
That's how you become a family.

01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:05.350

It's my fault.

We sold everything
to get you out.

01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:39.850
We lost everything.

and dragged away.

Call your Yakuza informant.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.850
It's Murakami Ken.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:09.180
He's the head of
Hiroyoshi Yakuzas.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:13.990

went to the U.S. and said...

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.740
Korea will send soldiers

to Vietnam for financial support.

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:12.160
He disappears for days
high on drugs.

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:16.740
Yu-sik has the most boys.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.080
But they aren't tight,
so he's the weakest to fight.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:23.220
Damn it!

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.779
Chew likes gambling

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:32.790
and has no sense of loyalty.

01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:37.760
Just futz with 'em for now.

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:39.260
Remember...

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:44.069
no one dies.

01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:47.630
To Big Boss! Cheers!

01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:49.069
Cheers!

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:56.780
Thank you, sir!

01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:58.510
Make yourselves comfortable.

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:04.320
Get lost, you son of a bitch!

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.680
But I'm a paying costumer!

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.330
Get out!

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.760
I came to give you business.

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:13.200
I'm not selling to you!

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.430
Never changed!

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:15.300
What?

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.660
Bastard!

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:24.080
Is that you? Sung-hoon?

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:28.040
Long time no see!

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:32.020
Haven't seen you in years!
Good to see ya!

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:36.780
All grown up and helping
your mama's business, huh?

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.790
Come with me.
Let's talk inside.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:46.930
You still have my last name?
CHOI?

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:49.090
- Unbelievable.
- He's not your son!

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:55.640
When I was in grade 4,
Mom first got married.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.740
I thought having a dad
like other kids would be great.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:08.050
But he always fought with Mom
and hit her.

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:12.960
Took all Mom's money
from the bar and gambled.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.500
Such a complete bastard.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.130
That guy back then?

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.370
And all the others after him.

01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:26.900
So ever since I was young...

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:30.530
I hated all men.

01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:34.640
Stepfathers, teachers, costumers....

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.910
Shit!

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.520
I wanted to grow up fast.

01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:43.260
That's all I'd think.

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:49.290
Then, one day...

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:51.990
Mommy...

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:57.530
got drunk and cried.

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:05.740
She said she made a mistake
and had me.

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:12.620
And her life got fucked.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.660
Don't remember your
real dad at all?

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:20.390
Only his funeral.

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:25.220
I was too young
to remember much.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.290
Said he got beaten to death.

01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:37.540
A born mistake is bound
to make mistakes.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.980
You just got out.

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:45.250
Why'd you drink so much!

01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:54.120
Sorry, boss.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.590
No need to apologize to me.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.630
Go on in.

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:05.000
Goodnight, sir.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:10.740
Boss?

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:13.400
What?

01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:19.650
Thank you, sir.

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:23.950
Sure.
Watch your hangover.

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:26.120
Not that, sir.

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:29.620
What?

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.160
Inside the pen.

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:40.540
It was the first time...

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.580
a grown man...

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.310
ever took my side.

01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:00.320
Thank you, sir.

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:57.780
Why no batting cages
in this part of town?

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.620
Son of a bitch!

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:03.710
What, bastard?

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:05.520
What?

01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:08.020
You called me, fool.

01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:12.200
Hey, boys.

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:15.160
Drag the kid out.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.970
Bastards!

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:26.970
Son of a bitch!

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:48.260
Son of a bitch!

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:51.270
You asshole!

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.140
Son of a bitch!

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.420
Being in there suits ya!

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.790
Son of a bitch!

01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:17.290
You'll pay for this, bastards!

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.890
Remember?

01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:27.470
You did this to my head.

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:31.300
Fool!

01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:34.140
Go to hell, shithead!

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.080
Light him.

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.340
Burn him for 10 sec.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.580
Barbecue party!

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.750
What?

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:09.710
Something wrong?

01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:13.920
Sung-hoon...

01:17:16.290 --> 01:17:18.120
You wanted him under you?

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:24.330
That's why you made me
this bar?

01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:34.010
Men like us crave to be

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:38.340
in charge in our own ways.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.210
Politicians, businessmen...

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.910
athletes...

01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:48.520
and gangsters.
We're all the same.

01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:51.390
Especially...

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:56.830
guys like Sung-hoon and me
with boiling blood.

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:00.120
What do you mean?

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.460
Sung-hoon hates losing, too.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:09.040
He had to protect himself
since he was young.

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:13.210
He grew up knowing
if you're weak, you're beat.

01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:17.010
No use trying to stop him now.

01:18:20.490 --> 01:18:24.320
He'll reach his potential
under me.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.550
I'll make sure of that.

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:33.930
But what if he dies?

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.500
If he does...

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.230
what will you do?

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:46.540
Give me 10 receipts.

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:52.020
Mom says she'd rather
make offerings than pay taxes.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.220
What?

01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:57.750
Buddha hates
this kind of money?

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:00.790
I'll take it.

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:04.960
We can use this money.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.860
But since we're a small temple,

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.070
I'll ask about the receipts.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.540
Whatever you say, monk.

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:16.900
Why are you doing this?

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.640
Do what?

01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:23.080
Don't you hate me?

01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:26.780
No, fool.

01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:30.460
Just think you're pathetic.

01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:38.390
Kiss up to your boss...

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:46.700
and pray hard
for Yong-baek's soul.

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.610
Back then...

01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:52.680
I went to his cremation.

01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:57.610
A worker there said
it'll take over 2 hours.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.650
He told us to go eat
and come back later.

01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:04.150
That was it.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:07.450
Someone dying...

01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:10.490
Just say it, fool.

01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:14.370
Yong-baek died cuz of me.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.600
No.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:18.170
It's not because of
anyone else.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.910
It's just retribution
for a former life.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.540
So?

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:27.210
Saying that
to make me feel better?

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.710
No, I'm saying live right.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.690
What?

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.290
I'll keep praying so that

01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:43.650
you'll sin less and be good.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.760
Cut the crap, you asshole.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.900
Just put up lanterns
with the money.

01:20:54.610 --> 01:20:55.940
You phony monk!

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.720
You stupid fool.

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.820
Call that a tattoo?

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.460
I know, sir.
My tattoo's kinda weak.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:23.890
But...

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.770
I got charisma, sir.

01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:29.210
Right.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.070
Think what you want.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.180
Going home already, sir?

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.010
I'm taking a dump.

01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:43.850
Sir! Go to Starbucks.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.950
It's really clean there, sir!

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:55.230
All that instant food!

01:21:55.630 --> 01:22:00.070
WOO Jang-chun would be horrified.

01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:03.300
Who's WOO Jang-chun?

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:07.370
Don't know?
The seedless watermelon?

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.550
Why no seeds?

01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.650
I don't believe this.

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:18.120
You heard of
WOO Jang-chun, right?

01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:20.420
Boss Jang-chun?

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.830
If I see his face,
maybe it'll ring a bell.

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.800
You bird brain!

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:32.130
During Japanese rule,
Dr. WOO Jang-chun...

01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:38.140
made seedless watermelon and...

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.050
What was that?

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.330
Jo-tae's undergoing brain surgery.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.800
And Jumbo will end up
a cripple for life.

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:13.270
It's me.

01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:16.740
Why are you doing this, sir?

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:21.520
Thought you could use
a vacation abroad.

01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:24.790
Looks like
you misunderstood, sir.

01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:28.180
Don't you know
I hate going on planes?

01:23:28.530 --> 01:23:30.720
I thought you wanted
to get rid of me.

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.190
I'll go to where you are, sir.

01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:39.460
Ever been to the big seawall?

01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:42.870
No, but I'll find it.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.380
I'll be there at noon

01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:50.340
fishing with just my driver.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.710
Let's work out
the details, sir.

01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.920
Fine.Let's talk in person.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.190
It's inevitable.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.570
What was that?

01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:51.970
What, sir?

01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:54.370
Why throw coins out?

01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:01.580
When I see roadkills,
I throw 'em coins.

01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:06.780
So if they're still alive,
they can call 911.

01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:13.360
Ever hit one while driving?

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.900
I don't think so.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.500
Why, sir?

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.470
It's best to run 'em down good.

01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:29.580
Otherwise, you were killed.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.930
CHOI Sung-hoon?

01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:57.070
What?

01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:05.140
I heard your real last name
is HAN.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.760
Catch anything?

01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.370
Have a seat, sir.

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:23.730
Forget it.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.800
I'll just stand.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:38.110
After Dong-su
hit on Boss Hyung-du...

01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:40.720
he sat at a place like this.

01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:47.760
He suddenly asked me
who'd win a swimming race.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.620
CHO Oh-ryun or a turtle...

01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:55.560
After he died...

01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:03.210
I thought long and hard
about what he meant.

01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:07.470
So? Did you find out?

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.020
Not sure if it's right...

01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:16.450
But maybe he was talking about
having to fight between friends.

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:21.460
He probably meant,
it's all useless.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:26.500
Something like that?

01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:29.000
I guess.

01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:32.460
Could be.

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:40.040
I'll just take Haeundae
with my boys.

01:27:41.850 --> 01:27:46.950
How about having the rest of Busan
like before, sir?

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:06.570
I smell a rat.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.470
No matter what...

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:10.980
Eun-gi's up to something.

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:14.110
On Sunday...

01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:17.510
arm up all our boys.

01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:23.220
Yes, sir.

01:28:54.850 --> 01:28:56.520
You go take a piss.

01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.350
Yes, sir!

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.940
I was so shocked.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:20.670
You're mom brought
this little kid...

01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:23.950
to Boss Dong-su and cried.

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:27.850
I thought it was his nephew.
I had no idea!

01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.790
You stood trial together?

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.050
Right.

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:42.190
Since Boss Joon-suk fessed up
to everything...

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.570
I got out real soon.

01:29:45.370 --> 01:29:54.470
Back then, I just did as I was told.

01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:58.980
The fact is...

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.550
Joon-suk is the one

01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:08.750
who planted me under your dad.

01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:14.230
After that happened...

01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:18.530
it was really hard on me.

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:24.070
Being close and spending
every day with Boss Dong-su...

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.710
I saw his humane sides.

01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:31.750
I came to really like him.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:37.750
He was a hard, tough man,

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.890
but very open.

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.230
I don't really have
any memories of him.

01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:52.500
Just tell me your message
to Boss Joon-suk.

01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:56.730
To be honest...

01:30:58.510 --> 01:31:04.680
I never saw Joon-suk
do anyone in himself.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.640
He never gets blood
on his hands.

01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:15.520
He always got
the little boys to do the job.

01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:19.800
That's why you wanted
to see me?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.440
Know who got the order

01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:29.470
to kill your dad?

01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:42.120
Wanna talk to him?

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:52.390
I was just 19.
What would I know?

01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:59.100
I was so stupid

01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:04.370
and regret it like hell.

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.440
What is taking charge...

01:32:12.450 --> 01:32:17.720
that friends must order
to kill each other?

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:21.960
Yeah?

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.060
Oh, no.
What do we do, sir?

01:32:27.570 --> 01:32:28.560
What?

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:05.390
The Chairman passed away.

01:33:09.570 --> 01:33:13.140
No matter what happens...

01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:17.510
you stay back and quiet.

01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:19.980
What?

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.820
Gather up the boys.

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:41.630
Scatter out and stay low.

01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:45.100
Make the money last.

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.750
Don't call each other.

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:17.740
Get rid of this shit!

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:38.420
<i>KIM HYUNG-DU</i>

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:53.360
Everyone pull out, now.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.800
Let's go!

01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:19.930
Everything's set?

01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:22.560
Don't worry, sir.

01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:26.390
Good.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:34.040
Hurry! Get lost!

01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:14.580
Shit!

01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:38.290
The hell?

01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:52.330
Where are you?

01:39:54.710 --> 01:39:55.740
Outside, sir.

01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:58.910
It's all done.

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:02.390
Come in and greet the others.

01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:10.230
Why?

01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:15.700
Wants me to greet 'em.

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.000
Bow to 'em.

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:35.880
Hello?

01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:48.590
There's something
I have to get off my chest.

01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:03.280
You're a gangster, too.

01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:07.110
Must've used tools before.

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:11.980
When you do someone in...

01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:20.460
you give a few blows
and make 'em cripples.

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:29.930
People don't cut up people
that brutally.

01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:43.310
Look!
Get those bastards!

01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:02.200
He didn't resist much.
So, I was going to stop.

01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:09.770
But Eun-gi, that bastard...

01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:20.120
I keep having nightmares.

01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:26.560
I can't take it anymore.

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.200
That day...

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:33.180
I went over quite late.

01:45:34.050 --> 01:45:43.360
I heard you and Dong-su
fighting over Jin-sook.

01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:47.800
That night...

01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:56.070
Dong-su held me.

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.840
Instead of Jin-sook...

01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:06.040
me...

01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:16.860
It's Capt. KIM, sir.

01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:28.140
Yes?

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.810
no one will die?
Didn't you promise me

01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:37.770
Bring me all the bastards
who killed at the hospital.

01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:41.550
I have no choice.

01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:46.460
Now, it's war
between you and me.

01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:55.430
In a hospital at 2 AM today...

01:46:55.570 --> 01:46:59.330
a top Busan gangster head
has been murdered.

01:46:59.570 --> 01:47:03.030
The suspects lured police away

01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:05.670
and went inside the hospital.

01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:10.250
Police suspect it occurred
over a power war between gangs.

01:47:10.410 --> 01:47:12.510
YTN news, KIM In-chul.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.830
It's okay.

01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:39.170
We need to talk.
You stay far back.

01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:58.820
A while ago...

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.890
you met Eun-gi in private?

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:06.000
Yes.

01:48:07.170 --> 01:48:08.570
Why didn't you tell me?

01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:14.340
It wasn't anything important.

01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:17.110
Just rambled on some shit.

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:28.520
Cops can't cover
for you on this one.

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:39.030
You said it's best
to run 'em down good.

01:48:53.250 --> 01:48:55.880
I'll deal with the cops.

01:48:56.590 --> 01:48:58.150
Till I call you back...

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:02.920
stay quiet for 2 or 3 years.

01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:07.430
When you arrive and call me...

01:49:09.370 --> 01:49:11.770
I'll send you the money
you need.

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:36.320
Go on.

01:49:55.580 --> 01:49:59.880
You dropped the cigarette
and gave the sign...

01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:07.420
to do my dad in?

01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:59.400
Where to, sir?

01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:03.840
Anywhere...

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:08.370
No one calls me over.

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:49.220
Got any close friends?

01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:56.380
My best friend died
a while back.

01:52:58.660 --> 01:52:59.560
Why?

01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:03.390
Because...

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.430
I made a mistake.

01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:23.980
Joon-suk!

01:53:26.690 --> 01:53:29.090
Joon-suk!

01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:32.090
They're calling us.

01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:37.230
It's time to go.
