WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:09.843
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.512 --> 00:17.183
Priest duties for this operation will be
performed by former airman Haruto Okonogi,

00:17.434 --> 00:21.855
High Steward in the Department of
Divinities, as well as...

00:22.272 --> 00:23.273
Ahem!

00:24.941 --> 00:26.151
...Natsume Misumi.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.612
You were assigned a seat.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.657
Ah, yes. But I wanted to sit next to Haru.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.701
Huh?

00:34.951 --> 00:37.078
I like Haru.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.336
Shall we continue?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.380
Yes, ma'am. Um...

00:47.464 --> 00:50.383
The trickiest part of the Ritual will be

00:50.467 --> 00:52.969
getting Lord Mitatsu to roll over
on Fushido.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.055
That girl's something else.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.223
She's so young.

00:57.307 --> 01:01.102
Couldn't guess Airman 1st Class
Okonogi was in the priesthood.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.688
Those two are
childhood friends, right?

01:03.813 --> 01:06.775
Yeah, but she's too suspicious!

01:06.983 --> 01:08.985
You think so too, right, Amakasu?

01:10.487 --> 01:11.321
Uh-huh...

01:11.571 --> 01:13.948
Is there something wrong, Hisone?

01:14.157 --> 01:17.535
Oh, no, it's just that I've never
met someone like her,

01:17.786 --> 01:20.747
Well, there's no one like that
in the Air Self-Defense Force.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.332
That's true. Hmm?

01:24.459 --> 01:26.211
Flight Leader Kakiyasu,

01:26.377 --> 01:31.132
if it's okay, I would like to opt out
of doing the base tour.

01:31.382 --> 01:32.592
I understand.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.094
I'll take them around instead.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.553
Haru...

01:36.930 --> 01:37.847
Amakasu!

01:38.723 --> 01:40.100
See ya later.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.396
Will you go with me somewhere?

01:45.563 --> 01:46.523
Y-Yeah!

01:46.689 --> 01:49.442
It's the hoist launcher
needed for the next training.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.486
Masotan's new equipment, right?

01:51.569 --> 01:55.198
No, I'm having difficulty with it 'cause
it was machinery from 70 years ago...

01:57.242 --> 01:58.451
Seventy years ago?

02:01.913 --> 02:02.956
What the heck is that?

03:53.358 --> 03:56.361
All the existing risk management
measures for the Ritual

03:56.486 --> 03:58.071
are summarized in that report.

03:58.154 --> 04:01.282
But something crucial has been left out.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.453
I wanted to speak with you on that point
before adding it in, Ms. Hinomoto.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.413
What is this crucial information?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.166
Anastomosis.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.835
Masotan!

04:15.046 --> 04:16.089
Thanks for today.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.927
The pylon adjustments went well
because of you.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.722
Recently, I've been feeling
pretty good for some reason.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.642
Your conformity is going well.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.853
But now, we'll need to be careful about
the anastomosis.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.480
What's anastomosis?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.565
-Oh! No, I mean...
-Excuse me.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.610
What is his name?

04:37.694 --> 04:38.528
Natsume?

04:38.778 --> 04:41.781
Natsume! Didn't I tell you
not to go wandering around?

04:43.825 --> 04:46.202
I want to know his name.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.453
Jeez!

04:47.870 --> 04:51.165
Um, his name is Masotan.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.668
Masotan. What a weird name.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.880
Masotan gets anxious around people,
he doesn't like being touched...

05:04.178 --> 05:05.471
Is there a problem?

05:05.555 --> 05:08.599
Not really. Rather, the lack of problems
is more the problem.

05:09.517 --> 05:13.813
Um, did I do something to Natsume?

05:13.896 --> 05:15.982
Huh? I don't think so.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.526
But she only stares at me

05:18.609 --> 05:21.195
with her super intense glare.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.156
She's always been like that.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.535
She doesn't lie, or rather
she's just a blunt person.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.621
There's nothing that you did personally.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.458
Well then! I will be leaving.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.835
Huh? Amakasu?

05:36.127 --> 05:39.422
There must be much
for you two to talk about.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.300
You young ones can take your time!

05:44.218 --> 05:46.346
Young ones?

05:49.974 --> 05:53.603
Here, F-15 and F-2
will maintain a hovering position,

05:54.062 --> 05:56.939
U-Um, excuse me,
but why are you next to me?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.567
What's the nature
of your relationship with Haru?

05:59.692 --> 06:02.904
What? W-We're just comrades.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.448
What is a normal comrade?

06:05.656 --> 06:08.743
Does Haru have other special comrades?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.497
What's with that outfit?

06:12.872 --> 06:14.332
Aren't you embarrassed?

06:15.583 --> 06:17.919
Viet Cong ramen for lunch today?

06:18.252 --> 06:20.421
I might smell afterwards, won't I?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.757
Does that mean
you've abandoned your femininity?

06:23.716 --> 06:25.760
Doesn't this one work better?

06:26.094 --> 06:30.556
Why did you eat that if you were worried
about your breath in the first place?

06:30.973 --> 06:32.642
-E-Excuse me!
-Hmm?

06:32.725 --> 06:35.019
I've been wondering
about this for a while.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.815
Why are you so strict with me?

06:39.565 --> 06:42.443
Oh, I'm only saying what I think.

06:43.903 --> 06:44.946
I see.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.572
So that's all it is!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.826
I totally understand!

06:49.909 --> 06:52.745
I always end up saying
whatever pops into my head!

06:52.829 --> 06:55.206
Then I hurt people's feelings
and feel depressed after.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.708
Oh, I don't think
I'm doing anything wrong.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.920
And you reek of garlic,
so please don't come close.

07:02.839 --> 07:03.756
Ah, cola!

07:04.882 --> 07:08.886
Haru isn't a morning person,
so he always drank one before school.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.889
He said he couldn't wake up without it.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.518
And on the days he didn't have one,
he'd be super late.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.604
But Okonogi is an early bird now.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.359
He wakes up earlier than anyone
and calls roll in a loud voice.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.363
But now that I think about it, that must
be why he's always got bed hair.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.452
Actually, I can barely
keep myself from laughing.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.544
Did I do it again?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.716
So, what are you doing cowering in here?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.760
Right now, I need a shell.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.556
Snails without shells don't stand
a chance against high school girls.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.099
I'm gonna pour salt on you!

07:55.183 --> 07:57.852
She has become quite attached to you.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.062
Aren't you mistaking it
as her picking a fight?

08:00.146 --> 08:04.066
Either way, who cares
about what that brat says!

08:04.525 --> 08:08.696
But what Natsume says is very wholesome.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.450
In that case, I don't think
she means any harm.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.035
Surely she's not a bad person.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.163
How masochistic!

08:17.622 --> 08:20.666
Dammit, your passivity is gonna
get you killed someday.

08:20.750 --> 08:21.834
Yes! That's fine!

08:22.502 --> 08:25.838
Wait... I'm destined... to be killed?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.592
Well, you did go out with Okonogi alone.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.763
If that chick gets wind of that,
she's gonna murder--

08:35.431 --> 08:37.517
How do you know that, Nao?

08:38.392 --> 08:42.146
-They went to see a movie together.
-It's the first time I've heard of it,

08:42.230 --> 08:45.816
but I also think Hisone
is driving at full speed into hell.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.360
Right?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.071
Everyone else, too? Why do you think that?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.823
You're closest to him.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.742
Closest to who?

08:54.825 --> 08:56.661
You and Okonogi, of course.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.330
But aren't you and I close, Nao?

08:59.455 --> 09:01.832
We've never gone to the movies together!

09:02.333 --> 09:04.335
Okay then, let's go, let's go!

09:04.460 --> 09:08.589
The next session is do or die,
and that's an understatement.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.469
I and Okonogi?

09:14.136 --> 09:17.181
I wonder why I feel so...

09:18.599 --> 09:19.725
happy!

09:20.226 --> 09:23.938
I've always wanted this!
To be acknowledged by others...

09:24.397 --> 09:26.148
as a friend!

09:27.024 --> 09:29.569
How many times must I repeat myself,
Technical Sergeant Amakasu?

09:29.944 --> 09:32.905
Get closer to the target, goddamit!

09:34.282 --> 09:38.494
I can't! I can't!

09:51.007 --> 09:53.426
-<i>You freaking blockhead!</i>
-Eek!

09:53.759 --> 09:56.637
-This is...
-<i>Like an unwinnable video game.</i>

09:56.721 --> 09:59.432
<i>There's no way we can do this.</i>

09:59.932 --> 10:03.436
Cutting the sacred Shimenawa rope
that ties Lord Mitatsu's two tails.

10:03.519 --> 10:08.441
If it cannot be done in one go,
the rolling will be unsuccessful.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.612
Be that as it may...
It won't be easy.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.991
The priest and those miko will
physically be there, too.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.412
Speaking of the shrine maidens,
have you told them about the key girl?

10:22.121 --> 10:22.955
No.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.792
I don't believe it's a good idea
to tell them at this point.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.128
Yeah.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.088
Oh my God.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.633
We'll die if we keep going.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.843
This is too much for the first day!

10:43.392 --> 10:45.561
Natsume is really amazing.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.563
Yeah. She's the prettiest, too.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.399
I'm not sure about
the whole "Haru" thing.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.486
She'll definitely be the key girl.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.114
Why are you all resting?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.492
We need to do this right.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.452
One more time from the top!

11:02.411 --> 11:03.621
Okay!

11:51.919 --> 11:53.921
Oh, Sada!

11:55.715 --> 11:56.966
Does it take you back?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.636
Those girls shine, don't they?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.765
I feel a stab in my heart just thinking
of what's to come.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.644
It's their sacred duty,
to ring their bells every day

12:09.186 --> 12:10.813
and keep dancing.

12:11.647 --> 12:14.275
Then one girl will be chosen.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.737
Let's find another place to talk.

12:20.865 --> 12:24.368
You still shine, too.

12:24.994 --> 12:29.373
<i>Hiso Maso!</i>

12:34.920 --> 12:35.796
Masotan?

12:36.255 --> 12:37.590
Masotan!

12:41.177 --> 12:42.845
Oh, Masotan!

12:44.305 --> 12:48.184
After training Masotan
time is always best!

12:49.268 --> 12:51.020
I'm sorry, Masotan.

12:51.353 --> 12:54.273
It doesn't seem like I can
visit much for a while.

12:54.607 --> 12:59.779
What if I'm seen in the same place
as Okonogi?

13:00.154 --> 13:03.324
I don't wanna die! Masotan!

13:07.328 --> 13:10.748
Ms. Hinomoto's training
takes a mental toll on us, too.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.335
All we did was fail.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.630
Seriously! You girls are great!

13:17.713 --> 13:19.715
You're different than I pictured.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.218
The image that miko
are holy and sacred is an illusion.

13:22.426 --> 13:25.095
Only the Dragon Pilots
can't get boyfriends.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.642
The men think
Technical Sergeant Hitomi is--

13:30.142 --> 13:31.143
Is that right?

13:31.268 --> 13:32.770
Let's go for a drink now.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.105
We can have a welcome party for you!

13:35.272 --> 13:37.858
Jeez. I wish they'd get lost fast.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.194
They're clearly on cloud nine.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.947
Hey, they're underage.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.324
What's up with you, Zaito?

13:45.407 --> 13:47.117
Suddenly you're so serious.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.245
I'm always serious.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.580
Hey, let's take a pic together.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.999
Take the picture,
but then go home and sleep.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.210
Huh?

13:56.794 --> 13:58.462
I can't get us both in.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.506
Ah, jeez. Give it here.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.220
Uh, sorry.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.805
What about the pic?

14:09.306 --> 14:10.850
Hey, hold on a sec!

14:11.016 --> 14:12.184
Wait, Hoshino!

14:14.854 --> 14:18.524
-It just looked bad.
-Why are you explaining yourself to me?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.608
Well, 'cause...

14:19.817 --> 14:21.902
You and I are just associates.

14:22.069 --> 14:25.322
If you wanna cozy up to high school girls
and flirt around,

14:25.489 --> 14:26.782
that's got nothing to do with--

14:28.325 --> 14:29.410
Hoshino!

14:43.799 --> 14:45.926
Y-You're the worst!

14:46.010 --> 14:48.304
-Unbelievable!
-It wasn't on purpose--

14:48.596 --> 14:50.014
Don't you ever come near me!

14:50.097 --> 14:52.266
You creepy, lecherous perv! Lecher!

14:52.516 --> 14:53.851
You're a brute!

14:58.981 --> 14:59.982
Seriously.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.529
Seriously?

15:08.157 --> 15:09.033
Okay.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.286
Haru!

15:12.995 --> 15:14.455
Haru?

15:20.210 --> 15:22.212
Hey you, have you seen Haru--

15:22.338 --> 15:23.255
Huh?

15:31.138 --> 15:32.681
<i>Haru has the same one.</i>

15:37.770 --> 15:41.023
Huh? Natsume?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.570
Natsume!

15:51.075 --> 15:52.284
Natsume!

15:54.328 --> 15:55.287
Um...

15:56.163 --> 15:57.081
I'm very sorry!

15:58.624 --> 15:59.458
Huh?

15:59.541 --> 16:01.210
Probably no, definitely,

16:01.335 --> 16:04.463
I did something
to create a misunderstanding!

16:04.755 --> 16:07.716
I was in the hangar to "lick, lick, lick."

16:07.800 --> 16:09.093
"Lick, lick, lick" is

16:09.176 --> 16:12.221
a way for me to interact with Masotan.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.975
Anyway, I wasn't there to lick Okonogi.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.102
I would never do that!

16:20.396 --> 16:22.314
I like Haru.

16:22.731 --> 16:23.565
Huh?

16:24.441 --> 16:26.193
I love him.

16:26.318 --> 16:29.321
Ever since I discovered my feelings,

16:29.446 --> 16:31.323
I've always, truly,
and properly loved him.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.076
That's why I can't forgive you.

16:34.326 --> 16:39.039
You think we're the same because
we're blunt, but we are not at all alike.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.666
You lie all the time!

16:40.749 --> 16:44.586
No, I haven't lied!
I really don't have a filter!

16:44.920 --> 16:46.338
Then say it.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.174
-I really don't have a filter!
-Not that.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.387
Tell me that you like Haru.

16:53.762 --> 16:54.847
Say it!

16:56.557 --> 16:57.391
Like?

16:58.308 --> 17:00.894
I... like Okonogi?

17:02.813 --> 17:05.649
No, no. What are you saying?

17:05.816 --> 17:09.611
To think that I like Okonogi?
I mean, I don't hate him.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.405
I think his bedhead is cute.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.700
I like the freshness of his voice
as if he just finished puberty,

17:14.783 --> 17:16.660
I have to say
I enjoy hearing it.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.414
Oh yeah! And how he smokes
to make up for his baby face,

17:20.539 --> 17:23.625
or how he stoops like a cat,
but he actually likes dogs,

17:23.709 --> 17:25.669
and his eyes always droop,
so, he looks tired.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.088
There's plenty to like about him.

17:28.547 --> 17:32.259
But it's not in the way that you think.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.344
Yeah, it's completely different!

17:34.720 --> 17:36.346
-It's the same.
-Huh?

17:37.014 --> 17:39.641
All of that means you like him.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.531
Hold...

17:55.032 --> 17:55.908
Hold on.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.672
No! No!

18:10.839 --> 18:13.759
The reason I've been feeling uneasy...

18:14.468 --> 18:18.347
was because I have feelings for Okonogi!

18:18.847 --> 18:22.392
The more I think about it,
the more sense it makes.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.521
Which means that I really,

18:25.604 --> 18:28.232
that towards Okonogi, I am...

18:29.483 --> 18:32.611
My feelings for Okonogi are...

18:59.471 --> 19:00.305
Plop.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.735
We will soon begin the joint training.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.821
Board your aircraft!

19:19.283 --> 19:20.617
<i>Amakasu!</i>

19:21.160 --> 19:23.120
Fly as usual and you'll be fine.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.165
-<i>If you need anything, use the wireless--</i>
-Masotan!

19:26.456 --> 19:28.458
<i>Swallow me up quickly!</i>

19:29.209 --> 19:30.127
Amakasu?

19:36.133 --> 19:38.594
<i>Serpent, taxi. Runway 28.</i>

19:38.677 --> 19:40.137
Let's go, Masotan.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.809
What's wrong, Masotan? Let's get moving.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.644
<i>It's okay to fly now.</i>

19:48.312 --> 19:49.396
Amakasu?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.778
<i>This is Penguin! I've got an emergency!</i>

19:56.862 --> 19:58.363
<i>The suit is starting to melt!</i>

19:58.447 --> 20:00.240
All of you, what's your status?

20:01.158 --> 20:02.701
Morris here, no problem.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.411
Same for Jimmy.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.997
Hisone is in trouble!

20:07.497 --> 20:08.707
That's not possible!

20:08.790 --> 20:12.544
These are the most updated suits
based upon data taken from past flights.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.796
The suits should be durable
for much longer!

20:14.880 --> 20:20.093
<i>The training is now suspended. All pilots</i>
<i>must forcibly eject from their OTF!</i>

20:21.303 --> 20:24.348
<i>Did you hear me?</i>
<i>Withdraw from your OTF immediately!</i>

20:24.932 --> 20:26.058
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

20:26.308 --> 20:27.142
<i>Copy.</i>

20:27.809 --> 20:28.894
Masotan!

20:35.192 --> 20:36.026
Amakasu!

20:36.276 --> 20:37.110
Amakasu?

20:37.319 --> 20:38.153
Hoshino!

21:08.433 --> 21:10.352
Spray them with the medicine quickly!

21:10.644 --> 21:12.813
<i>Neutralize the gastric acid</i>
<i>on their bodies!</i>

21:13.230 --> 21:14.064
Spray!

21:19.569 --> 21:23.407
It seems that we were too late.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.909
My apologies.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.119
Amakasu!

21:27.411 --> 21:28.412
Amakasu!

21:30.122 --> 21:31.081
Are you okay?

21:32.582 --> 21:33.500
Why?

21:34.626 --> 21:35.794
Amakasu.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.671
Masotan.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.799
Masotan said he was in pain.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.467
Then...

21:42.843 --> 21:44.845
Anastomosis has taken place.

21:45.971 --> 21:51.893
When there's an emotional change in
a pilot who is well-aligned with her OTF,

21:52.352 --> 21:54.563
that is when anastomosis occurs.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.274
Anastomosis?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.109
So that was it.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.696
In that case, I can see why
the suits melted.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.740
Anastomosis, in layman's terms,

22:05.449 --> 22:10.162
is the OTF proactively trying
to digest you.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.747
Digest?

22:12.247 --> 22:13.540
So in other words,

22:14.124 --> 22:17.127
they're eating the pilot?

22:17.794 --> 22:20.797
Oh no.
Why all of a sudden?

22:21.631 --> 22:24.926
If it's bad or not,
it depends on the pilot's belief.

22:25.093 --> 22:28.930
In brief, the Organic Transformed Fliers
are trying to eat them 'cause...

22:29.514 --> 22:34.978
Hisone and El have certain emotions
that we don't have?

22:35.479 --> 22:37.272
That's one way of putting it.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.274
You two...

22:39.941 --> 22:41.443
fell in love, didn't you?

22:43.570 --> 22:44.446
You...

22:45.447 --> 22:46.948
are in love.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.951
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.709 --> 24:22.294
<i>-He's kind.</i>
<i>-Are you stupid?</i>

24:22.377 --> 24:24.129
<i>-He's kind.</i>
<i>-Are you stupid?</i>

24:24.254 --> 24:26.047
<i>-He's is really kind.</i>
<i>-Huh?</i>

24:26.381 --> 24:29.217
<i>-It's so stupid.</i>
<i>-He's so kind and sweet.</i>

24:29.426 --> 24:31.219
<i>I miss Amakasu.</i>

24:32.179 --> 24:33.221
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

24:41.938 --> 24:44.941
