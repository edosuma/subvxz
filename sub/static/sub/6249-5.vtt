00:00.180 --> 00:04.240
Come,my brave children,to
the hideous halloween maze.

00:04.250 --> 00:08.790
Avoid the creepies and the crawlies that
live in every dark corner of the maze.

00:08.800 --> 00:12.210
And the first one to reach
the center and emerge alive

00:12.220 --> 00:14.580
will win the grand prize.

00:15.750 --> 00:16.840
Oh,here we go.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:37.380 --> 00:38.800
Where am I?

00:45.700 --> 00:47.420
somebody help me!

01:12.380 --> 01:13.920
Right this way,miss.

01:15.610 --> 01:17.560
Now that is an excellent costume.

01:17.570 --> 01:18.380
What are you wearing?

01:18.390 --> 01:19.240
What? Now?

01:19.250 --> 01:21.880
No,not now. To the
jeffersonian halloween ball.

01:21.890 --> 01:23.540
What I always wear.
Are you going this year?

01:23.550 --> 01:26.940
I'm the official unofficial
fbi liaison to the jeffersonian.

01:26.950 --> 01:28.380
Of course I'm going.

01:28.390 --> 01:29.840
We just passed the wolman.

01:29.850 --> 01:33.290
Go straight towards the
guillotine and veer left.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.490
It's a maze. What can I do?

01:34.500 --> 01:37.110
Dr.Potoska,how were
the remains discovered?

01:37.120 --> 01:38.960
A kid passed out.

01:38.970 --> 01:40.200
What killed him?

01:40.210 --> 01:41.790
The kid didn't die. He just fainted.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.070
Then why am I here?

01:43.080 --> 01:45.280
Well,when matty fainted,I
was here with my own kids.

01:45.290 --> 01:48.080
I'm a pediatrician,but
I'm also the coroner.

01:48.090 --> 01:49.000
Small town.

01:49.010 --> 01:51.890
Yeah,well,matty revived easily enough.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.260
Uh,he's what you call
a nervous type kid.

01:54.270 --> 01:56.780
But then I saw what it was that
made him faint in the first place

01:56.790 --> 02:00.230
and I almost fainted,too,because it
was a mummy,which I told the sheriff,

02:00.240 --> 02:02.340
who called the fbi,who
called the jeffersonian.

02:02.350 --> 02:06.700
And now here we are,lost in this
stupid maze looking for the mummy.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.420
A mummy?

02:07.430 --> 02:09.910
Yeah,I do not see a guillotine.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.900
*******

02:13.650 --> 02:14.200
a cowboy?

02:14.210 --> 02:15.570
No,it's a scarecrow.

02:15.580 --> 02:17.220
Look,just keep turning
to the right,all right?

02:17.230 --> 02:19.230
Let me know when you reach the dragon.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.880
Uh,dead end...

02:20.890 --> 02:21.680
with teeth.

02:21.690 --> 02:23.210
That's because you
turned left at the goblin.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.560
You were supposed to turn right.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.330
Look,when you say a mummy,you mean,uh...

02:27.340 --> 02:29.780
Wrapped in bandages,curse of
king tut. You know,a mummy.

02:29.790 --> 02:34.000
No offense,but I'm not certain
a pediatrician is qualified...

02:34.010 --> 02:36.690
pediatrician and
coroner. See that?Yeah...

02:36.700 --> 02:39.880
okay,we are at the electric chair.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.850
There's an electric chair?

02:42.360 --> 02:45.430
Look,just tell the guy to throw his
flashlight up in the air,will ya?

02:46.710 --> 02:51.280
Uh,the fbi requests that you
toss your flashlight into the air.

02:51.290 --> 02:53.170
Ten-four.

02:55.650 --> 02:56.950
There it is.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.650
Oh,let's see if we
can get there this way.

02:59.660 --> 03:01.360
Guys.

03:06.070 --> 03:07.550
After you.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.250
What do you think,bones?

03:17.530 --> 03:22.700
ocular contents dry,****

03:22.710 --> 03:24.560
leathery skin...

03:24.570 --> 03:27.240
these are actual human remains.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.660
A mummy.

03:28.670 --> 03:30.860
How long will it take
to get out of this maze?

03:30.870 --> 03:32.860
Not as long as you might think.

04:09.810 --> 04:13.580
Takes a steady flow of dry
air over a long period of time

04:13.590 --> 04:15.890
to achieve this kind of
desiccated mummification.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.339
The incan ice woman of peru.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.760
The tarim basin mummies of china.

04:19.769 --> 04:22.820
The peat bog tollund man in denmark.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.040
How old are we talking?

04:24.050 --> 04:25.870
Buttons... zipper,rivets...

04:25.880 --> 04:27.430
she's probably wearing jeans.

04:27.440 --> 04:31.430
So,freakozoid murder-mummification
rather than fascinating history?

04:31.440 --> 04:32.200
She?

04:32.210 --> 04:34.670
Shape of the innominate
bone indicates female.

04:34.680 --> 04:35.850
Now listen,boys.

04:35.860 --> 04:38.530
The jeffersonian halloween
party-- it's compulsory.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.640
Donors,patrons,angels,benefactors.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.540
So we all show up in
costume and do our duty.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.390
I don't want any argument o

04:44.400 --> 04:46.270
i will be the back end of a cow.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.520
So no costume.

04:48.530 --> 04:51.410
Naomi from paleontology
has agreed to be my front.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.160
Ah,so many jokes,so little time.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.080
It's fine. We're all in.

04:56.090 --> 04:58.200
I'll be edward john smith for halloween.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.390
Ill-fated captain of the titanic.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.130
What about angela and dr.Brennan?

05:02.140 --> 05:04.770
Dr.Brennan always wears the
same costume to these things.

05:04.780 --> 05:05.600
She loves it.

05:05.610 --> 05:07.280
Help me remove these.

05:08.460 --> 05:10.130
Ooh,what's with the smell?

05:10.140 --> 05:10.920
Cedar oil?

05:10.930 --> 05:12.860
Also used in mummification.

05:12.870 --> 05:15.090
What about this clear
coating over the skin?

05:15.100 --> 05:15.910
Lacquer.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.850
She was painted to death?

05:17.860 --> 05:20.280
The clothing came from a
church-run thrift store.

05:20.290 --> 05:22.300
How could you possibly know that?

05:22.310 --> 05:25.520
There is no bug or slime
specific to church thrift stores.

05:25.530 --> 05:26.530
You don't know that.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.120
I'm the bug and slime guy.

05:28.130 --> 05:31.900
You're just the auxiliary bone guy who
dresses up like the back end of a cow.

05:31.910 --> 05:33.510
Hodgins?

05:38.710 --> 05:40.950
Free church of america thrift store,huh?

05:40.960 --> 05:41.960
Tell booth.

05:41.970 --> 05:43.510
I knew it wasn't bugs or slime.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.180
No you didn't,and that's
what makes me king of the lab!

05:47.190 --> 05:50.240
A loyal servant of the empress.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.690
Clothes from this ministry
were found on a dead body?

05:55.710 --> 05:58.320
Well,I'm afraid that
happens fairly often.

05:58.330 --> 05:59.410
Why?

05:59.420 --> 06:01.690
Because we're a charitable congregation.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.240
Homeless people know that we'll
provide them with what they need.

06:04.250 --> 06:08.240
Do you,by any chance,remember
these specific pieces of clothing?

06:08.250 --> 06:09.810
This is from your murder victim?

06:09.820 --> 06:10.740
Pastor jonas?

06:10.750 --> 06:12.630
Do you have anything like this in red?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.680
You're looking for something
that screams satan,right?

06:14.690 --> 06:15.390
Basically.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.890
I think we have a pink cape in the back.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.490
Maybe we can dye it.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.630
What kind of church
dresses kids like satanists?

06:22.640 --> 06:24.090
Let me show you.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.350
At halloween we do a hell house.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.430
Fornication,theft,murder,gambling,

06:31.440 --> 06:34.330
usury,sodomy,abortion.

06:34.340 --> 06:36.220
It's kind of horrific,isn't it?

06:36.230 --> 06:39.530
Well,abandoning the path of
righteousness is horrific,dr.Brennan.

06:39.540 --> 06:43.280
This is our way of
remaking a pagan holiday--

06:43.290 --> 06:47.540
halloween,into a positive
celebration of christian values.

06:47.550 --> 06:49.770
Excellent prostitute,stephanie.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.630
Anyone ever dress like a mummy?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.750
We've never featured a false idol room,

06:53.760 --> 06:55.360
though,now that you mention
it,it's not a bad idea.

06:55.370 --> 06:59.230
Ancient egyptian religious beliefs
endured for almost 4,000 years.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.620
Twice the length of christianity.

07:00.630 --> 07:02.480
Look,any of your kids
suddenly disappear?

07:02.670 --> 07:03.360
No.

07:03.370 --> 07:08.570
What if the children that you save from
abortion grow up to be usurers and sodomites?

07:09.100 --> 07:11.600
I don't respond to mocking
semantics,dr.Brennan.

07:11.610 --> 07:14.200
Nor do I,but she's serious.

07:14.210 --> 07:18.880
In that case,my serious answer would be
that in being given a chance to live a life,

07:18.890 --> 07:24.040
the aborted soul will have a multitude
of opportunities to repent for their sins

07:24.050 --> 07:26.350
and live bathed in the holy spirit.

07:28.170 --> 07:30.260
- Thank you.
- Thank you?

07:30.270 --> 07:31.770
You're welcome.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.300
My name is amber kippler.

07:33.310 --> 07:36.380
I'm a senior investigator with
doyley private investigations.

07:36.390 --> 07:42.120
Mr.Doyley assured me he'd be taking a personal
interest in the search for ms.Montenegro's husband.

07:42.130 --> 07:42.990
Interest,yes.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.220
But I'll be doing the actual footwork.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.470
Mr.Doyley is taking a
very personal interest.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.170
Only not from up close.

07:49.180 --> 07:52.140
Do you have a lot of
experience at this kind of work?

07:52.150 --> 07:54.950
Angela montenegro is
not your birth name.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.570
You changed your name on your 18th
birthday becaus came to you in a dream.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.720
you never told me that.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.450
I never told anybody that.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.750
If I can discover something
nobody knew about a client,

08:07.760 --> 08:11.290
I'm not being paid to investigate,imagine
what I can do for real.

08:11.310 --> 08:12.200
Good point.

08:12.210 --> 08:14.400
I never told anybody about that.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.090
Yes,you did,actually.

08:16.100 --> 08:20.140
A girl named roxie whose heart you
broke in second year art school.

08:22.660 --> 08:24.360
Oh,roxie.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.180
What do you know about me?

08:28.190 --> 08:33.130
Wouldn't it be better if we got to
ms.Montenegro's husband,grayson birimbau barasa?

08:33.140 --> 08:34.049
You found something?

08:34.059 --> 08:36.390
I found the actual human man.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.330
In florida. In the keys.

08:38.669 --> 08:39.970
No name key. Very remote.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.090
Did you talk to him?

08:41.100 --> 08:42.490
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

08:42.500 --> 08:44.350
My instructions were to locate.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.460
That being achieved,we
can now discuss contact.

08:46.470 --> 08:47.940
We want you to contact him.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.690
Him to sign the divorce papers.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.370
By get him do you mean...

08:54.100 --> 08:56.750
- Force him to sign them?
- If necessary.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.400
Do you have a gun?

08:58.410 --> 09:02.880
Or just remind him of who
I am and ask him politely.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.260
What are you? Canadian?

09:05.910 --> 09:08.040
We'll do this one step at a time.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.310
- Didn't that pastor guy make you mad?
- No.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.360
He's a fundamentalist.

09:13.370 --> 09:14.820
I appreciate consistency.

09:14.830 --> 09:17.830
Oh,the consistency of trying
to scare kids into christianity?

09:17.840 --> 09:20.040
How do we keep kids from smoking?

09:20.050 --> 09:21.630
We tell them it gives them cancer.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.100
It does give them cancer.

09:23.110 --> 09:24.060
According to science.

09:24.070 --> 09:26.540
You know,that's all you
care about is science.

09:26.550 --> 09:28.840
In the end,even someone
who believes in empiricism

09:28.850 --> 09:31.200
and science has to take a leap of faith.

09:31.210 --> 09:31.860
What?

09:31.870 --> 09:35.300
I believe in what i can
hear,taste,see,touch and measure.

09:35.310 --> 09:37.010
You believe in what you feel.

09:37.020 --> 09:41.080
Pastor jonas believes that god
speaks to him through a sacred book.

09:41.420 --> 09:44.260
I feel like we're on the wrong
side of the argument here.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.780
It's cam. What's up?

09:46.790 --> 09:48.940
I really need you to come back.

09:48.950 --> 09:49.640
What's going on?

09:49.650 --> 09:53.010
I got a couple here,says they think
the mummy in the maze is their daughter.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.100
Oh,that'd save us some
time on identification.

09:55.110 --> 09:57.290
Their daughter only
disappeared last week.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.790
The remains we found
were at least a year old.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.630
Look,I'm great with corpses,but
when it comes to loved ones...

10:02.640 --> 10:05.270
let's just say there's a reason
why I'm not a pediatrician.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.510
So if you got a siren,turn it on.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.210
Right.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.250
Megan is 14.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.400
She didn't run away.

10:13.410 --> 10:14.800
Something terrible happened.

10:14.810 --> 10:16.370
She's a very pretty girl.

10:16.380 --> 10:19.920
What makes you think the remains
we found are your daughter?

10:19.930 --> 10:23.940
The news said that you found the
body of a teenage girl in a fun house.

10:23.950 --> 10:25.900
I suddenly knew it was megan.

10:25.910 --> 10:26.900
Suddenly knew?

10:26.910 --> 10:29.150
Mr.And mrs.Shaw,it wasn't a fun house.

10:29.160 --> 10:29.980
It was a maze.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.450
And the remains we found
are more than a year old.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.110
- You're certain?
- Yes.

10:34.950 --> 10:36.840
I see.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.820
I'm sorruse me.

10:40.780 --> 10:43.040
I don't understand why
you're disappointed.

10:43.050 --> 10:44.760
Your daughter might still be alive.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.760
Megan is not still alive.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.780
I just *** I can't explain it.

10:50.790 --> 10:52.870
I'm her mother.

10:55.330 --> 10:58.360
- I'm sorry.Does this face mean anything to you?
- No.

10:59.370 --> 11:01.790
Does she have something
to do with megan?

11:01.800 --> 11:04.250
This is the girl that
we found in the maze.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.540
definitely not megan.

11:10.130 --> 11:10.660
Yes?

Just****

12:26.360 --> 12:27.570
What's wrong?

12:28.550 --> 12:30.310
the phone rang.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.320
It's cam on the phone. It's ringing.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.720
Coulrophobia.

12:34.060 --> 12:36.830
The fear of clowns. Coulrophobia.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.810
It may explain why you
shot that clown last year.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.820
Look,I have no problems with clowns.

12:40.830 --> 12:42.250
I can stand right here. See?

12:42.840 --> 12:44.010
And the phone. Booth.

12:44.020 --> 12:46.830
We got an id on our maze
victim off of angela's sketch.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.510
Great. Uh,details to follow?

12:48.520 --> 12:50.190
I think you want to hear this now.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.790
Name's stella higgins,15 years old.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.850
Disappeared a year ago today.

12:54.860 --> 12:55.610
What's she saying?

12:55.620 --> 12:58.170
Id and date of disappearance
of our maze victim.

12:58.180 --> 13:01.890
Booth,stella was last seen
at shoreline amusement park.

13:02.830 --> 13:03.780
What wow?

13:03.790 --> 13:05.920
More coincidences. thanks.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.500
The maze victim disappeared from here.

13:08.510 --> 13:11.010
So we just go right past the clown.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.200
I can walk right past
the clown,like she said.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.680
Just right...

13:18.970 --> 13:20.660
torture dungeon.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.960
Yeah. Okay.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.310
Clowns,scary. Not you.

13:26.970 --> 13:29.170
Oh,gee. You're kidding me,right?

13:31.810 --> 13:35.870
oh,look at the eye,huh?
It's a ping-pong ball.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.140
Not this one.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.570
How do you know?

13:46.580 --> 13:48.050
Human remains,booth.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.500
It's sort of my specialty.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.490
this is a dead person.

13:56.420 --> 13:59.810
The first thing booth needs to
know is if this is megan shaw.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.460
It is not megan shaw.

14:01.470 --> 14:02.430
I agree.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.020
It would be impossible to mummify a body
like this in just a little more than a week.

14:06.030 --> 14:07.710
Dental records do not match.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.360
Lacquer and cedar oil.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.710
Looks like the same murderer.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.280
That's leaping to a conclusion.

14:12.290 --> 14:13.560
I said looks like,zack.

14:13.570 --> 14:15.120
Looks like is not leaping.

14:15.130 --> 14:17.730
Her phalanges--
fingers-- are damaged.

14:17.740 --> 14:20.600
Metacarpals are... cracked.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.820
You've seen something like this before?

14:23.170 --> 14:25.420
In iraq,there were some remains...

14:25.430 --> 14:26.690
they had been buried alive.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.570
This person was buried alive?

14:28.580 --> 14:29.810
I'm not comfortable...

14:29.820 --> 14:32.870
it looks like this person
was buried alive. Correct?

14:32.880 --> 14:37.830
Thtattoo on the second victim's shoulder
matches that of judith suzanne evans...

14:37.840 --> 14:40.790
16 when she went missing.

14:41.130 --> 14:41.930
How long ago?

14:41.940 --> 14:44.530
- Two years,almost to the day.
- From?

14:44.540 --> 14:46.490
Shoreline amusement park.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.940
She was there with her big sister
and a couple of her friends.

14:48.950 --> 14:53.520
Skin and hair removed from beneath stella's
fingernails turns out to be her own.

14:53.530 --> 14:56.490
Also,the lacquer used on both
victims is completely generic.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.630
It's widely available.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.070
She pulled out her own hair?

14:59.080 --> 15:01.220
What makes somebody do that?

15:01.590 --> 15:05.010
There are small puncture marks,hundreds
of them,all over her body.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.910
Like insect bites,but larger.

15:06.920 --> 15:10.130
In both cases,the lacquer was
infused with a number of particulates

15:10.140 --> 15:12.540
including a spore i'm
trying to identify.

15:12.550 --> 15:13.620
Are you ready to admit that

15:13.630 --> 15:16.970
it looks like both these girls were
killed and mummified by the same person?

15:16.990 --> 15:18.440
I'm not prepared to...

15:18.450 --> 15:20.900
Jump to that conclusion.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.670
Come on. You expect me to know when
one body appeared in a pile of bodies?

15:24.680 --> 15:25.670
That's not reasonable.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.240
An actual,genuine corpse
appears,and you don't notice?

15:28.260 --> 15:30.670
The place is called
dungeon of a 1,000 corpses.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.780
Which is exactly why an entire fbi
forensics team is sweeping this facility.

15:34.790 --> 15:35.810
Facility?

15:35.820 --> 15:38.390
This hole counts as a facility?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.090
I know you.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.120
- No.
- Yeah.

15:41.130 --> 15:43.700
You were at the maze the
other night. Same costume.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.300
Oh,yeah.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.020
Yeah. You're just recalling that,huh?

15:46.030 --> 15:48.230
- What's your name?
- Gregg.

15:48.510 --> 15:49.130
Little hint.

15:49.140 --> 15:52.530
Fbi asks for your name,you
give the whole name.

15:52.540 --> 15:53.870
His name's gregg liscombe.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.130
He's worked here three years.

15:55.140 --> 15:57.400
You're not supposed to wear
the costume to other gigs,dude.

15:57.410 --> 15:58.520
Dilutes the effect.

15:58.530 --> 16:00.320
All the other bodies
are fakes,agent booth.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.970
Okay. We'll just keep the entire
fun house as a crime scene.

16:02.980 --> 16:04.080
Yes,sir.

16:04.090 --> 16:05.690
In that case,can I send my people home?

16:05.700 --> 16:07.690
Oh,no. All your people have
got to talk to my people.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.280
And you're coming with me.

16:09.290 --> 16:09.910
Why?

16:09.920 --> 16:12.000
Two places with dead bodies,

16:12.040 --> 16:15.370
and you're standing in the
doorway dressed as the grim reaper.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.400
It's my job,man.

16:16.420 --> 16:18.340
It's not like I adopt the persona.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.230
Don't say anything
without a lawyer,gregg.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.330
Tell you what else,gregg's
got the keys to the place.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.030
Shut up,dan! He's got keys,too.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.160
And so does cleaning
crew. And park security.

16:27.470 --> 16:28.860
How about you? You got keys?

16:28.910 --> 16:30.870
I've got nothing else
to say withou******

16:30.880 --> 16:32.130
okay,that's great,pincushion,

16:32.140 --> 16:34.930
'cause you were practically
invisible until now.

16:34.940 --> 16:38.820
Now you're bucking
as number one suspect.

16:40.880 --> 16:46.570
Judith evans,age 16,our victim
from the dungeon of 1,000 corpses.

16:46.580 --> 16:49.320
I've identified stress
fractures to both tibias,

16:49.330 --> 16:54.270
as well as tears to the medial collateral
and anterior cruciate ligaments in both knees.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.410
Catcher's knee.

16:55.420 --> 16:58.500
There's nothing in the bio about
judith evans being a baseball player.

16:58.510 --> 17:03.850
Compressions to vertebrae c1 through c7
indicate that her neck was bent like this.

17:03.860 --> 17:05.160
But forced.

17:05.170 --> 17:08.560
I am not liking the picture
that's forming inside my head.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.880
Phalanges cracked,and
her fingernails shredded,

17:10.890 --> 17:14.900
her head forced that way,her
knees jammed up against her chest.

17:15.190 --> 17:18.000
Do we think judith
evans was buried alive?

17:18.010 --> 17:22.829
I,uh,I have... another bad
image of how stella higgins died.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.680
- Spiders.
- Spiders?

17:24.690 --> 17:26.470
Tarantulas,to be specific.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.369
Poisonous spiders?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.110
That's a common misconception,

17:29.120 --> 17:32.320
though the lack of poison doesn't
make the bite any less painful.

17:32.330 --> 17:36.240
This is an urticating hair
from the theraphosinae family.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.560
It appears to be barbed.

17:37.570 --> 17:39.120
Yeah. It's very irritating.

17:39.130 --> 17:40.410
Hey,little-known fact:

17:40.420 --> 17:43.480
Tarantula hair was the main ingredient
in itching powder for decades.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.700
Is there any correlation between
these hairs and the fact that

17:45.710 --> 17:47.790
stella higgins scratched
herself so badly,

17:47.810 --> 17:49.120
and pulled out her own hair?

17:49.130 --> 17:50.180
She's bitten all over.

17:50.190 --> 17:51.950
There had to be dozens
of tarantulas on her

17:51.960 --> 17:53.980
so,yeah,there's a correlation.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.760
I was operating under
the assumption that

17:55.770 --> 17:59.010
the mysterious spore was transported
by the tarantula, but I was wrong.

17:59.020 --> 17:59.760
How do you know?

17:59.770 --> 18:02.440
Because there's no tarantula
hairs on judith evans,

18:02.450 --> 18:05.340
but plenty of the
spores and particulates.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.520
She has carcinogenic
dibenzopyrene isomers,

18:08.530 --> 18:13.570
asbestos,po manganese and barium.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.030
And steel dust.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.720
Which adds up to...

18:16.730 --> 18:18.520
Internal combustion engines.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.740
Traffic. Except for the steel dust.

18:20.750 --> 18:23.700
I have no clue about the steel dust.

18:23.710 --> 18:27.530
Well,stella's tox results
show chloroform,ephedrine,

18:27.540 --> 18:30.540
theophylline,clonydine
and methamphetamine.

18:30.550 --> 18:34.050
Judith's remains show trace
evidences of the same compounds,

18:34.060 --> 18:35.460
but in different concentrations.

18:35.470 --> 18:37.660
Ephedrine is synthetic adrenaline.

18:37.670 --> 18:39.310
Most of those are heavy stimulants.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.750
Their metabolisms would race.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.700
Heart rates would
accelerate dangerously.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.260
Spiders.

18:45.270 --> 18:48.110
Live burial. Drug-induced panic...

18:48.780 --> 18:52.140
is our murderer literally
scaring girls to death?

18:53.880 --> 18:56.590
I always felt,somehow,that
judy was still alive,

18:56.600 --> 18:58.510
even after two years.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.300
It's crazy,huh?

19:00.310 --> 19:01.770
Probably guilt,right?

19:01.780 --> 19:03.700
For letting my little
sister out of my sight?

19:03.710 --> 19:06.010
Look,you can't blame yourself.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.430
Did my sister suffer?

19:10.210 --> 19:15.010
You know,we got the best people in the world
figuring out exactly what happened that night.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.990
So...

19:18.200 --> 19:21.570
you and your sister went to
the amusement park together?

19:21.580 --> 19:24.330
Its kind of the thing
to do on halloween.

19:24.340 --> 19:25.720
My mom made me take her.

19:25.730 --> 19:26.740
I didn't want to.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.550
I mean,I loved judy...

19:28.560 --> 19:31.290
but she was your kid
sister-- pain in the ass.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.620
She made me take judy,even
though I didn't want to,

19:34.630 --> 19:36.520
and mom never got over that.

19:36.530 --> 19:38.540
How did you and judy get separated?

19:38.550 --> 19:39.730
Judy got scared.

19:39.740 --> 19:41.700
She didn't want to go in the fun house.

19:41.710 --> 19:42.260
Why?

19:42.270 --> 19:44.680
There was this huge
monster above the door.

19:44.690 --> 19:45.720
Judy freaked.

19:45.730 --> 19:48.040
She said go ahead,she'd wait outside.

19:48.050 --> 19:49.590
Judy was claustrophobic.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.290
How bad?

19:50.300 --> 19:51.190
Pretty bad.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.780
She wigged out when
we were driving down.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.690
There were six of us jammed in a car.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.740
We had to stop and let
her out a couple times.

19:57.750 --> 20:02.220
Do you remember if there was a grim
reaper that night at the entrance?

20:02.230 --> 20:03.260
Yeah,there was.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.900
Could that be him?

20:04.910 --> 20:05.810
Yeah.

20:05.820 --> 20:09.670
When we came out looking for judy,he
told us she had taken off with some guy.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.270
The police could never confirm that.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.120
Registered sex offender.

20:15.130 --> 20:19.240
He was present at two places where
the remains of young girls were found.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.470
Coincidence.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.150
Statistically improbable.

20:22.160 --> 20:26.020
Scientifically improbable
but,in the real world,impossible.

20:26.030 --> 20:29.110
Do you recognize these two girls?

20:29.120 --> 20:32.550
Man,every girl that comes
in there talks to me.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.710
I don't remember them.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.120
Why does every girl talk to you?

20:35.130 --> 20:36.710
'Cause I'm cute,scary.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.160
Yeah,you do pretty well with the
teenage girls,don't you,gregory?

20:40.170 --> 20:41.030
You get them all tingly?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.650
All right,that sex offender
thing? It's a joke,man.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.500
Look it up.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.900
I got drunk,and I took a
leak in a public fountain.

20:46.910 --> 20:47.770
Yeah. We did look it up.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.460
There was a group of schoolgirls
on the other side of that fountain.

20:50.470 --> 20:54.040
Four times,you've been caught with your
pants down,all around teenage girls.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.050
Coincidence?

20:55.060 --> 20:58.930
Two years ago,you told this girl's
sister that she took off with some guy.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.580
Do you remember her?

21:01.590 --> 21:02.400
Yeah,sure.

21:02.410 --> 21:03.740
It's the girl that disappeared.

21:03.750 --> 21:07.070
The thing about you guys-- you're all
the same. You sniff each other out.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.070
Who was the guy?

21:10.070 --> 21:13.860
Judith evans disappeared
october 24,two years ago.

21:13.870 --> 21:18.050
Stella higgins,one year
ago,a week before halloween.

21:18.060 --> 21:18.860
So?

21:18.870 --> 21:22.650
So,megan shaw vanished
from the same place.

21:22.660 --> 21:25.350
You can see the common
element here,can't you,gregg?

21:25.360 --> 21:26.660
- You.
- Coincidence.

21:26.670 --> 21:29.380
There are no coincidences
in a murder investigation.

21:29.390 --> 21:31.670
Well,it's got nothing to do with me.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.880
Geez,you can'T... did you see that?

21:35.300 --> 21:38.010
Hey! Megan shaw was 14 years old.

21:38.020 --> 21:40.430
Understand me? Who was the guy?

21:43.600 --> 21:45.230
- Good shot,bones.
- Thanks.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.320
There was no guy!

21:46.330 --> 21:48.070
- It was lola.
- Lola?

21:48.080 --> 21:49.780
- The girl with the piercings?
- Yeah.

21:49.790 --> 21:51.200
What the hell were you doing with her?

21:51.210 --> 21:53.220
It's not what you think.

21:53.700 --> 21:58.180
The girls come with me,maybe we get
it on a little... lola likes that.

21:58.190 --> 22:00.710
Your girlfriend likes to
see you with little girls?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.590
She likes to interrupt.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.160
You know,maybe smack
them around a little.

22:04.170 --> 22:06.250
- Smack around?
- Yeah.

22:06.260 --> 22:09.500
It gets lola hot. For us.For later.

22:11.190 --> 22:14.970
Sometimes,maybe she
goes a little too far.

22:21.710 --> 22:25.910
How did you get to and from a
remote,nameless florida key so fast?

22:25.940 --> 22:26.990
It does have a name.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.150
Its name is no name key.

22:28.190 --> 22:29.880
Your confusion is natural.

22:29.910 --> 22:33.710
Uh,did you talk to my husband?

22:33.750 --> 22:36.140
Mr.Barasa was very pleasant.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.460
Very pleasant.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.820
I mean,wow!

22:38.900 --> 22:43.460
He smelled exactly like a fresh
wind just after a summer storm.

22:43.510 --> 22:44.790
You smelled him?

22:44.840 --> 22:47.550
Part of the private
investigator credo,dr.Hodgins:

22:47.570 --> 22:50.190
Insure that the
client-- that's you--

22:50.200 --> 22:50.970
and him.

22:51.000 --> 22:51.770
I'm paying.

22:51.770 --> 22:55.700
The credo says make sure the client is
committed to their objective at each step.

22:55.730 --> 22:57.790
Ergo,fresh wind after
summer storm reminder.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.830
Despite the storm,I want a divorce.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.060
In that case,the news is disappointing.

23:03.070 --> 23:07.540
Mr.Barasa was nice,but
adamant-- no divorce.

23:08.210 --> 23:11.200
Was it because he doesn't
remember getting married?

23:11.240 --> 23:14.680
Mr.Barasa totally remembers everything.

23:14.910 --> 23:18.540
He built this
for you-- a house.

23:19.530 --> 23:20.740
A shack!

23:20.790 --> 23:23.020
A whimsical cottage.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.990
It's darling.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.490
He built a house for me?

23:27.580 --> 23:29.250
Okay,let's be honest.

23:29.270 --> 23:30.330
It's a shanty.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.700
Here's what mr.Barasa said
100% verbatim,word for word.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.620
- Verbatim means word for word.
- What?

23:35.630 --> 23:36.930
You sort of said it twice.

23:36.960 --> 23:37.910
Hodgins.

23:37.940 --> 23:41.180
I quote literally to the letter:

23:41.210 --> 23:46.800
Ever has it been that love does not know
its own depth until the pain of separation?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.380
The guy writes poetry.

23:50.410 --> 23:51.580
Please.

23:51.600 --> 23:55.520
He was talking about
you,ms.Montenegro,with tears in his eyes.

23:55.550 --> 23:57.370
He should get a grip.

24:00.180 --> 24:02.210
What would you like me to do next?

24:02.230 --> 24:04.050
What are you gonna do here,ang?

24:04.080 --> 24:07.810
This guy built you a
house,he cried a little bit.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.180
He smelled like a fresh
wind after a summer storm,

24:10.220 --> 24:14.480
and you can practically see the lights
of havana from the porch of that cottage.

24:15.690 --> 24:17.580
I want a divorce.

24:17.920 --> 24:22.090
If I'm gonna shack up
with anybody,it's this guy.

24:24.640 --> 24:27.980
We're gonna discuss this
between ourselves,miss kippler.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.200
I'll let you know how
we want to proceed.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.940
Okay.

24:35.080 --> 24:39.340
Did I mention he's the most
beautiful man I've ever seen?

24:39.610 --> 24:40.450
Don't blame me.

24:40.470 --> 24:42.500
P.I.Code: Keep it real.

24:46.270 --> 24:49.570
that girl lola gets
off on inflicting pain.

24:49.730 --> 24:50.670
Were you gonna hit her,too?

24:50.670 --> 24:52.770
No,not with a closed fist.

24:52.810 --> 24:54.550
- Why?
- Why? That leaves a mark.

24:54.590 --> 24:55.410
- Agent booth.
- Yeah?

24:55.420 --> 24:56.500
Spoke with the shaws.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.630
Asked if their daughter
had any specific phobias.

24:58.660 --> 24:59.260
Yeah?

24:59.290 --> 25:00.410
- Snakes.
- Snakes.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.920
One crawled up out of the drain of
her bathtub when she was a child.

25:02.950 --> 25:04.340
- So since then...
- okay,that's good.

25:04.350 --> 25:06.850
Just call all the pet
shops,the reptile specialists--

25:06.870 --> 25:08.170
I don't know,the
world of snakes--

25:08.190 --> 25:10.330
and see who's been buying 'em all up.

25:10.980 --> 25:13.210
Does lola strike you as a snake person?

25:13.240 --> 25:14.390
Look,I'll deal with lola.

25:14.410 --> 25:15.500
You go back to the lab.

25:15.510 --> 25:16.540
Why?

25:16.560 --> 25:18.100
I won't hit her unless you say so.

25:18.120 --> 25:21.640
Look,I'll do my street thing,you
do your lab thing,all right?

25:21.670 --> 25:23.710
Together,we catch bad guys.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.440
That's good math.

25:28.670 --> 25:30.500
The lacquer holds tarantula hairs,

25:30.510 --> 25:34.050
your mystery spores and particulates
which suggest heavy traffic.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.610
I'm aware of the parameters.

25:35.630 --> 25:37.020
I told you all that stuff.

25:37.040 --> 25:37.880
I'm thinking aloud.

25:37.910 --> 25:38.930
It's a technique.

25:38.940 --> 25:40.490
Are you concentrating on the spores?

25:40.500 --> 25:42.360
Yes,I'm looking at them now.

25:42.380 --> 25:43.510
He's aware of the parameters.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.200
And the unexplained
source of the steel dust?

25:46.220 --> 25:48.790
What I'd like is to look up
from this microscope in about,

25:48.800 --> 25:54.210
mm, ten seconds and find myself
totally alone and able to concentrate.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.680
Oh,not nearly far enough.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.030
Not even close.

26:05.640 --> 26:06.800
Is that your costume?

26:06.870 --> 26:08.390
Uh,yeah.

26:08.460 --> 26:10.360
It's sexually alluring.

26:10.420 --> 26:11.490
Thank you.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.100
I'm catwoman.

26:13.150 --> 26:14.440
The superhero.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.900
One of the most powerful
female superhero figures.

26:17.930 --> 26:18.730
I don't think so.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.990
Are you kidding catwoman?

26:20.030 --> 26:20.560
Can you fly?

26:20.590 --> 26:21.510
I have nine lives.

26:21.530 --> 26:24.150
Super strength,super speed,force
people to tell the truth?

26:24.170 --> 26:25.190
I think I'm pretty fast.

26:25.220 --> 26:27.720
Pretty fast is not super speed.

26:28.570 --> 26:29.420
Hawaii.

26:29.460 --> 26:30.150
Hawaii?

26:30.180 --> 26:33.300
The spore is atronecium
from the haleahi nebulae.

26:33.330 --> 26:34.770
It's a hawaiian orchid hybrid.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.850
The victims were mummified in hawaii?

26:36.900 --> 26:40.620
How else would hawaiian pollen
get absorbed into the wet lacquer?

26:48.250 --> 26:49.820
lola.

26:50.890 --> 26:52.400
Remember me?

26:53.230 --> 26:56.340
Not one word passes through these
lips without a lawyer's okay.

26:56.380 --> 26:57.660
Right,and if you
can't afford one--

26:57.700 --> 26:59.980
which is my guess--
one will be provided.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.970
Probably a crappy one who
studied law on the internet.

27:03.010 --> 27:04.100
What do you want?

27:04.130 --> 27:06.040
You attacked both of
those two dead girls.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.490
Did gregg tell you that?

27:07.510 --> 27:09.940
Yeah,and this one,too.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.990
I didn't kill anyone.

27:14.030 --> 27:14.600
That's right.

27:14.630 --> 27:16.280
It was gregg who forced you to do that.

27:16.310 --> 27:19.080
You know what,and if you don't tell
me what I need to know in two seconds,

27:19.090 --> 27:20.980
I'm gonna start removing your piercings

27:21.000 --> 27:22.950
and I'm not gonna start
with the ones on your face.

27:22.990 --> 27:25.190
Look,I roughed 'em up,all right?

27:25.200 --> 27:25.910
that's it!

27:25.930 --> 27:27.140
I was gone. I was out of there,man!

27:27.150 --> 27:28.160
Why do you think i'm never charged?

27:28.190 --> 27:29.250
- Yeah,okay.
- I'm gone,man!

27:29.280 --> 27:31.940
just remember,maryland and virginia
both have the death penalties.

27:31.950 --> 27:35.070
Keep that in mind before we
find megan's body. Let's go.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.250
These are really tight,man!

27:43.860 --> 27:45.260
Don't you have to put on your costume?

27:45.290 --> 27:46.330
I already did.

27:46.350 --> 27:48.520
I got a profile of
the killer from sweets.

27:48.550 --> 27:49.630
You mean dr.Sweets.

27:49.660 --> 27:50.890
Well,it's only theory,bones.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.870
I mean,it's what he's best at.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.880
I mean,he's only 12.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.040
Sweets says the killer
is definitely a male.

27:57.070 --> 27:58.440
Gregg is a male.

27:58.450 --> 28:02.700
No,gregg and lola work their
sick little thing together.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.320
Sweets says that the killer works alone

28:06.580 --> 28:09.660
and has a respectable blue-collar job.

28:10.040 --> 28:14.060
In his public life,he's into
saving people,he's unmarried.

28:14.090 --> 28:16.120
Oh,he has a police or
military background.

28:16.150 --> 28:19.480
You do realize that sweets
is describing you,right?

28:21.310 --> 28:22.340
How do I look?

28:22.800 --> 28:23.680
Good.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.960
Wonder-ful.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.250
- Get it?
- Yeah.

28:26.270 --> 28:28.030
- 'Cause you're wonder woman.
- I know.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.020
What are you supposed to be?

28:29.040 --> 28:30.320
Oh,I'm a nerd squint.

28:30.340 --> 28:33.530
You e,what is the rationale
behind that conclusion?

28:33.570 --> 28:34.960
That's not what they look or sound like.

28:34.990 --> 28:35.660
You mean we.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.020
That's not what we look or sound like.

28:38.080 --> 28:38.660
Okay.

28:38.700 --> 28:39.800
You see what i did right there?

28:39.840 --> 28:44.500
I corrected you,you know,in
character as a squint.

28:44.550 --> 28:48.380
Angela and hodgins have a few things
to show us before we go to the party.

28:48.710 --> 28:49.810
What?

28:51.950 --> 28:53.150
What?

28:53.830 --> 28:56.900
This marks the location of
shoreline amusement park.

28:56.910 --> 28:58.750
These are the locations
of three pet shops

28:58.780 --> 29:01.570
the fbi says sold out of
snakes in the last week.

29:01.580 --> 29:03.320
How many snakes in total?

29:03.360 --> 29:04.220
Over a hundred.

29:04.250 --> 29:04.800
Let me guess.

29:04.820 --> 29:06.980
- They all paid cash
- yep.

29:07.020 --> 29:09.940
And the last place sold
out about an hour ago.

29:10.920 --> 29:11.540
An hour ago?

29:11.560 --> 29:13.380
Booth,megan shaw is still alive.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.360
Wait a second. Both gregg
liscombe and lola are in custody.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.300
Sweets was right.

29:17.320 --> 29:17.930
They didn't do it.

29:17.950 --> 29:18.890
Hodgins!

29:18.910 --> 29:20.620
Hodgins has been isolating locations

29:20.630 --> 29:24.230
where the dead girls could have been exposed to
the metal particulates he found in the lacquer.

29:24.270 --> 29:24.890
Okay,how many?

29:24.910 --> 29:26.870
126,not including hawaii.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.490
126,that's not good enough.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.000
Megan shaw's still alive.

29:30.030 --> 29:30.740
What do you want me to do?

29:30.750 --> 29:32.180
He wants us to guess.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.110
Well,my guess is hawaii.

29:33.130 --> 29:34.210
Not hawaii.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.830
Well guess again,but better.

29:35.850 --> 29:36.990
No,sorry.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.190
Booth,they don't guess.

29:39.230 --> 29:39.960
Who's they?

29:39.980 --> 29:40.500
- Them.
- Them.

29:40.510 --> 29:41.470
Well,that's just stupid.

29:41.490 --> 29:43.080
We do not guess.

29:43.090 --> 29:44.470
You know what? You're a horse's ass.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.600
Cow. I'm a cow.

29:45.620 --> 29:46.470
See my udder.

29:46.490 --> 29:47.840
I need zack and hodgins.

29:47.860 --> 29:49.180
The rest of you can go to the party.

29:49.210 --> 29:52.670
How can we go to a party when a 14-year-old
girl's being tortured to death by snakes?

29:52.690 --> 29:55.600
People like us can't work at
full capacity with people like you

29:55.630 --> 29:57.830
constantly interrupting
with irrelevancies.

29:57.860 --> 29:58.940
It's true.

29:58.940 --> 30:01.790
I love you,but it's true.

30:01.830 --> 30:03.900
Okay,we're out of here.

30:03.930 --> 30:05.710
This is E.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.580
Let's go,cher.

30:07.640 --> 30:12.170
Okay,we i'll just sit right over
here in this chair and I'llt.

30:12.190 --> 30:14.180
Booth,no!

30:15.470 --> 30:16.210
Fine.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.240
I'll wait outside,okay?

30:18.290 --> 30:18.940
With this chair.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.260
I'll be outside with this chair.

30:26.670 --> 30:31.770
I'm worried that naomi from paleontology will
feel strange being only the front half of a cow.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.460
She got the good end of that deal.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.840
Who's stronger,catwoman or wonder woman?

30:35.890 --> 30:36.730
- Wonder woman.
- Wonder woman.

30:36.740 --> 30:38.340
I concur vehemently.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.570
All right,now,ignoring
the hawaiian pollen,

30:40.570 --> 30:43.150
these 126 sites represent loci

30:43.160 --> 30:45.900
where the necessary concentrations
of particulates can be found:

30:45.920 --> 30:48.580
Underground garages,tunnels,etc.

30:48.590 --> 30:52.360
Dr.Sweets says we can assume that
the murderer works for a living.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.520
You want us to go on psychology?

30:54.540 --> 30:58.040
Let's assume the killer has to
get back and forth from his...

30:58.050 --> 31:00.230
in comic books,it's
always called a lair.

31:00.240 --> 31:04.540
From his lair in time for his
job,sometimes during high-traffic hours.

31:04.550 --> 31:07.050
Can you remove the sites
which make that improbable?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.570
Assuming he needs to sleep.

31:08.590 --> 31:09.680
Say,six hours a night.

31:09.710 --> 31:10.730
12-hour shift.

31:10.740 --> 31:12.820
Leaving six hours for
travel and torture.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.800
At a maximum of two hours travel time.

31:14.820 --> 31:17.650
So,what,remove everything
more than a hundred miles away?

31:17.680 --> 31:18.470
Too simplistic.

31:18.490 --> 31:20.530
If it's on a highway,it
could be up to 120 miles away.

31:20.550 --> 31:23.780
Secondary roads,taking
traffic patterns i ***

31:23.790 --> 31:25.790
depending on the time of
day and weather conditions.

31:25.820 --> 31:28.000
It'll go faster if you do
the calculations in your head,

31:28.020 --> 31:29.660
zack,and don't explain it to us.

31:29.680 --> 31:30.770
Thank you.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.830
How many does that leave?

31:47.840 --> 31:49.760
No. No way the police can hit all those.

31:49.770 --> 31:51.340
Not spread thin on halloween.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.730
We can narrow it down further.

31:53.770 --> 31:55.240
Factor: Mummification.

31:55.260 --> 31:58.360
Yes,particulates plus
mummification requires...

31:58.370 --> 32:00.590
a steady,continuous supply of dry air.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.510
A large oven with blowers.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.040
I'd like to assume that the automotive
particulates arrived with the blowing air.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.190
Heated underground parking lots.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.550
How is that not guessing?

32:08.550 --> 32:12.290
Einstein referred to such assumptions
as acceptable intuitive leaps.

32:12.310 --> 32:15.210
I acknowledge einstein
as a scientific authority.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.270
But he failed us this time.

32:23.530 --> 32:25.340
The answer is in the anomalies.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.510
The hawaiian spore.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.230
And steel dust.

32:29.260 --> 32:30.240
What makes it?

32:30.280 --> 32:32.480
Grinding,drilling,abrading.

32:32.510 --> 32:34.330
Raping,milling.

32:34.350 --> 32:36.580
Train wheels.

32:37.130 --> 32:38.930
Okay,intuitive leap.

32:38.940 --> 32:43.140
When a train turns,it grinds
the rails,creates steel dust.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.510
Subways...

32:44.540 --> 32:47.030
which also provide warm,dry air.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.210
They're vented.

32:48.220 --> 32:52.460
What we need now are florists
who carry hodgins' hawaiian flower

32:52.500 --> 32:56.560
which are situated
directly over subway tracks.

32:57.940 --> 32:59.150
Hey,where you going?

32:59.170 --> 33:00.040
To get booth.

33:00.070 --> 33:02.220
Call me when you find the florist.

33:07.650 --> 33:08.890
You're sure about this?

33:08.940 --> 33:09.520
Not at all.

33:09.540 --> 33:10.580
Because you guessed.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.650
But we do not guess.

33:11.680 --> 33:12.460
I think you did.

33:12.470 --> 33:14.830
I dare you to put that
lasso of truth around you.

33:14.830 --> 33:16.350
Now you're being completely irrational.

33:16.370 --> 33:17.990
This lasso doesn't actually work.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.270
These bracelets aren't
actually made of amazonium.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.410
They're stainless steel.

33:22.430 --> 33:24.350
They can't stop a bullet.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.550
okay.

33:26.860 --> 33:27.600
Brennan.

Who?

35:11.940 --> 35:13.630
Let's get out of here.

35:14.070 --> 35:18.680
Eats up the girls,leaves them bleeding.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.410
Who shows up to help?

35:20.450 --> 35:21.400
Access to drugs.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.190
The emt.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.330
Smart.

35:23.350 --> 35:25.310
You should wear a lab coat at all times.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.430
Puts them in the back of his ambulance,

35:26.470 --> 35:28.480
he knocks them unconscious.

35:30.990 --> 35:32.530
just stay there.

35:35.010 --> 35:35.940
screams are coming from inside.

35:35.940 --> 35:37.220
- Can I shoot it?
- No!

35:38.280 --> 35:40.330
- Geez! You shot me!
- Sorry! Sorry,booth!

35:40.360 --> 35:42.460
- Damn it! I said no! Don't shoot! No!
- Are you all right?

35:42.480 --> 35:44.470
I think the bullet
bounced off my bracelet.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.030
Just like amazonium.

35:46.050 --> 35:47.750
Geez,bones.

35:52.810 --> 35:53.350
what are you doing?

35:53.390 --> 35:54.590
They're not poisonous.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.560
I know.

35:55.580 --> 35:56.380
I know.

35:56.390 --> 35:57.320
Then why don't you come down?

35:57.320 --> 36:00.150
It seems I'm not completely
in control of my actions.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.830
Just get on my back.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.400
God. Bones.

36:06.710 --> 36:07.270
megan?

36:07.290 --> 36:08.010
It's okay.

36:08.030 --> 36:09.770
can you understand me?

36:15.880 --> 36:16.500
My head.

36:16.530 --> 36:18.280
Just stop shooting at things,bones.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.610
- He had a gun.
- You stay here.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.590
Anyone comes through that
door,you shoot their heads off.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.290
Except me.

36:22.300 --> 36:23.500
My gun is too big for me.

36:23.500 --> 36:24.590
I could've told you
that a hundred times.

36:24.610 --> 36:25.800
Here,take mine.

36:25.830 --> 36:27.050
Guard megan.

36:27.900 --> 36:28.470
Come on,megan.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.370
Come here.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.850
it's okay.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.320
Damn it.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.580
How could a guy with military
training miss with a scattergun?

37:04.580 --> 37:05.720
What were you,navy?

37:05.740 --> 37:07.060
Infantry.

37:08.060 --> 37:12.300
Which is how I know you're
carrying the 50-caliber 500.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.920
Well,that's five shots.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.610
And by my count...

37:16.910 --> 37:19.420
you only got one shot left.

37:21.820 --> 37:25.020
That's one dumbass gun
to bring to a shootout!

37:25.040 --> 37:26.650
Where's your backup,booth?

37:26.680 --> 37:27.990
Shouldn't they be here by now?

37:28.010 --> 37:29.310
You need to be quiet.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.050
Can you do that,megan?

37:40.700 --> 37:41.430
bones,you all right?

37:41.440 --> 37:42.650
We're okay. We're okay.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.300
He's using you to get to us.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.580
Not for long,booth.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.830
I'm just gonna stick my scattergun
in there and empty the barrels.

37:48.850 --> 37:52.710
Your girl is gonna look like hamburger.

37:58.450 --> 37:59.860
One shot.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.480
one hell of a ***

38:13.610 --> 38:16.760
now can you see why I hate clowns?

38:28.470 --> 38:29.850
Ms.Kippler.

38:32.360 --> 38:35.290
Ms.Montenegro,you look amazing.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.780
Halloween,right?

38:37.550 --> 38:41.060
Look,hodgins and i haven't really
decided what we're gonna do next.

38:41.090 --> 38:42.550
I tried to seduce him,you know.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.280
Hodgins?

38:43.830 --> 38:45.950
No. Your husband.

38:45.980 --> 38:47.620
I took off my top and everything.

38:47.630 --> 38:48.280
Why?

38:48.310 --> 38:52.620
I've been told i have alabaster skin
that's really impossible to resist touching.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.240
Isn't that some kind
of conflict of interest?

38:55.260 --> 38:56.480
The pi code?

38:56.480 --> 38:59.860
It totally for you,the client.

39:00.200 --> 39:04.010
I was testing Your husband with my wiles
so that I could properly advise you.

39:04.030 --> 39:06.310
You are a very dedicated investigator.

39:06.330 --> 39:07.580
Which is why I have
to tell you something

39:07.590 --> 39:09.870
i didn't want to say
in front of dr.Hodgkins.

39:09.890 --> 39:11.230
Hodgins. There's no K.

39:11.250 --> 39:15.030
Your husband is deeply,deeply
in love with you.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.020
Also,he has incredible abs and forearms.

39:18.030 --> 39:21.080
So what I'm suggesting is
that I take you down there,

39:21.100 --> 39:27.250
mediate a meeting,and see if any old
sparks don't flare back into life.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.720
I'm in love with hodgins.

39:28.730 --> 39:29.340
Now.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.890
Forever,ms.Kippler.

39:30.910 --> 39:34.360
Did I mention the little catch in
his throat when he said your name?

39:34.400 --> 39:38.200
Look,all I want out of
him is a divorce,okay?

39:38.210 --> 39:41.380
So if you want to see him again and you
want to rub your alabaster all over him

39:41.380 --> 39:44.030
and shake his snow globe,be my guest.

39:44.050 --> 39:46.340
All I want is the divorce.

39:46.370 --> 39:47.540
I hear you.

39:47.550 --> 39:48.380
I believe you.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.750
I just wanted to make sure.

39:50.850 --> 39:55.230
And please don't ever
say ew about hodgin

39:55.250 --> 39:57.470
beards.I don'T...like beards.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.270
Especially in conjunction
with huge,blue eyes.

40:00.290 --> 40:03.990
Makes me feel like i'm staring into
one of those russian religious icons.

40:09.460 --> 40:10.840
Dr.Hodgkins.

40:10.860 --> 40:11.670
Hodgins.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.140
Were you just talking to angela?

40:13.160 --> 40:13.850
Yes.

40:13.850 --> 40:17.880
I was telling her that her husband
is extremely physically attractive.

40:17.910 --> 40:19.040
Okay.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.480
Enough with that now.

40:20.490 --> 40:22.470
Quit trying to drive a wedge.

40:22.490 --> 40:23.090
It's a fact.

40:23.120 --> 40:26.550
On a scale of one to ten,he's
ten to the tenth power.

40:26.620 --> 40:27.690
What am I?

40:29.060 --> 40:31.890
You're a solid 7.5 Which
is quite respectable.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.660
Your job is to help me
and angela to be together.

40:35.690 --> 40:39.530
Dr.Hodgkins,domestic issues
make up the core of our business.

40:39.570 --> 40:43.120
And I have to tell you,most
of the time they go back.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.260
They go back?

40:44.290 --> 40:47.310
They g husbands or their
wives most of the time.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.140
It's a fact.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.670
And you think angela should
go back to her husband?

40:51.680 --> 40:54.710
I don't have an opinion
about should or should not.

40:54.740 --> 40:57.080
I'm more interested in will or won'T.

40:57.100 --> 41:00.590
But in this case,in my opinion...

41:02.170 --> 41:04.760
I don't think she's
going back to her husband.

41:04.790 --> 41:07.590
Even after you practically
threw him at her?

41:07.600 --> 41:09.300
Exactly.

41:09.310 --> 41:10.430
Aren't you glad I did?

41:10.460 --> 41:14.420
Now you can sleep like a baby
because of my thorough approach.

41:19.530 --> 41:20.340
Thank you.

41:20.370 --> 41:22.520
That's right,thank you.

41:31.350 --> 41:32.990
Where is everybody?

41:33.910 --> 41:35.990
At the party,I guess.

41:36.030 --> 41:37.690
We could still go.

41:38.010 --> 41:39.630
Ah,we look like hell.

41:39.650 --> 41:41.150
It's a halloween party.

41:41.170 --> 41:43.010
We could be wonder woman and,um...

41:43.040 --> 41:45.470
what's superman's secret identity?

41:46.240 --> 41:47.190
Clark kent.

41:47.230 --> 41:47.880
Yes.

41:47.900 --> 41:53.340
We could be wonder woman and clark
kent after a really,really bad date.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.950
Yeah,bad date because you shot me.

41:56.990 --> 41:57.820
It was only a flesh wound.

41:57.820 --> 41:58.940
And you dropped me on my head.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.470
After you shot me.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.850
Okay,I think i got you on this one.

42:02.870 --> 42:04.550
Okay,wonder woman?

42:10.650 --> 42:12.990
I'm sorry you had to kill someone.

42:13.130 --> 42:15.230
I know you hate that.

42:15.530 --> 42:17.420
Yeah,he had it coming.

42:17.990 --> 42:19.660
You hate it.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.460
I'm sorry that happened to you.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.430
We saved the girl.

42:25.570 --> 42:27.340
That's a pretty good date.

42:27.350 --> 42:29.650
- Except not really a date.
- I know.

42:29.670 --> 42:30.890
It was work.

42:30.910 --> 42:31.920
Not a date.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.170
Really,really hard one.

42:33.190 --> 42:36.490
And we're not really
wonder woman and clark kent.

42:36.520 --> 42:37.960
We're brennan and booth.

42:37.980 --> 42:40.640
Look,you're the one who
brought up the date analogy.

42:47.140 --> 42:49.020
- you hungry?
- yeah

42:49.040 --> 42:49.710
Me,too.

42:49.720 --> 42:53.040
Okay,let's go grab a bite to eat.

42:58.670 --> 43:00.340
what the hell are you doing?

43:00.940 --> 43:02.560
Nothing.
