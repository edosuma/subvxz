and what this has
to do with Wolf.

it would work.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.280
Then you're selling these?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.240
But I got kicked out of the RSA.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.560

bad about Desiree.

Rita is saying.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.040
That means it's going?

29:59.160 --> 30:01.200
It's going.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.320
Practiced this
whistle for years.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.640
Bloody thing.

If you can't get it, shut it.

[suspenseful music]

30:26.200 --> 30:28.040
It was gone--

30:28.160 --> 30:29.200
just gone?

30:29.320 --> 30:30.360
Yes.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.080
Poof, vanished, like I said.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.160
How could that be?

30:33.280 --> 30:34.440
Well, I don't bloody know.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.800
Maybe someone pipped
us to the post.

-

30:36.800 --> 30:37.800
RITA: Who?

30:37.920 --> 30:39.680
Maybe Lefty's
contact squealed.

30:39.800 --> 30:40.800
That would be bloody typical.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.240
Or maybe it was Bert.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.120
WOLF: Or you talked.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.320
I never talk about a job.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.240
You did to me.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.320
I took it.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.000
You what?

30:56.120 --> 30:57.360
I took the safe.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.360
I snuck out the window,
went to the jewelers.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.360
[whistle]

31:00.480 --> 31:01.880
That's the signal.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
He needs to work on that.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.280
They don't teach him
anything at Scouts.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.520
How'd you get it away?

31:07.640 --> 31:09.200
It wasn't that hard.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.560
Why in hell would you
do something like this?

31:14.680 --> 31:17.360
To buy my freedom.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.520
What are you talking about?

31:18.640 --> 31:19.680
You can have it--

31:19.800 --> 31:21.920
the safe, everything
that's in it.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.240
But I don't want
to be in the gang.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.880
And I can't marry
someone I don't love.

TED: You're trying
to blackmail me.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.520
I'm just trying
to make you see.

31:29.640 --> 31:30.480
See what?

- No.
- Ted.

You stay out of it, Rita.

And you approve of
his dirty tricks?

32:09.960 --> 32:11.280
He showed initiative.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.680
He's an ungrateful little sod.

32:13.800 --> 32:14.960
And I've broken

live that down, eh?

No, Rita!

get your stickers.

to look back on this

easier for yourself.

as a matter of fact.

point in cutting off

something with his life.

up the engagement.

have a bit of a chat.

35:50.840 --> 35:54.400
Is this about the wedding?

35:54.520 --> 35:58.240
You don't really want
to get married, do you?

Not really.

want a baby either.

know if I will get it.

It's 1979, for god's sake.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.920
Your parents don't
know everything.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.920
And this is your decision,not anyone else's.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.160
When I was young, there
wasn't much else to do

36:46.280 --> 36:48.680
apart from get married.

36:48.800 --> 36:49.640
And I don't regret it.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.240
But if I was your
age now, I would

36:55.360 --> 36:56.760
want to get out there and live.

Well if you didn't
know, Desiree's

37:21.440 --> 37:23.560
broken off the engagement.

37:23.680 --> 37:24.800
Why is that?

37:24.920 --> 37:26.280
I'm not sure.

37:26.400 --> 37:30.000
There's a lot more shoutingand crying in my house.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.560
Well, I do have
some good news.

We got the safe back
and everything in it.

us going for months.

See, it wasn't a
cock up after all.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.360
I do have a bit of sad news.

37:48.480 --> 37:51.680
Wolf won't be joining

Oh, that's a shame.

the baby on her own?

There's been complications.

Something like that.

Desiree has booked herselfin at Family Planning.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.000
And she said that you
told her how to do it.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.040
It's not like it's
a secret, and I don't

38:14.160 --> 38:15.360
see why this is so terrible.

with my family.

Did that boy put
you up to this?

38:24.240 --> 38:25.760
No.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.680
But for Christ's sake,
Ngaire, no one should

38:27.800 --> 38:28.960
be forced to get married.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.320
It's just stupid.

38:30.440 --> 38:31.200
I had to.

38:35.800 --> 38:39.080
Then why would you wish
it on your own daughter?

am very happily married.

Of course you are.

you know that carries

40:35.320 --> 40:37.840

40:37.960 --> 40:40.280
It'll be more if they
go for attempted murder.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.400
Where did you get this?

40:44.520 --> 40:45.920
My father was in the war.
