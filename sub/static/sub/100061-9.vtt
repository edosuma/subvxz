00:26.396 --> 00:28.726
All right, 16 chairs. That all good?

00:29.773 --> 00:32.511
I actually told Kamekona to
cook for at least 20 people.

00:32.828 --> 00:35.414
Okay. All right, uh,
I'll grab a few more then.

00:35.439 --> 00:36.539
All right, thank you.

00:36.876 --> 00:38.042
- Hey, boss?
- Yeah.

00:38.429 --> 00:43.055
Um, I remember when 
my sister passed away.

00:43.976 --> 00:46.215
You know, holidays are a little bit...

00:46.240 --> 00:48.527
You know, 'cause
-'cause sometimes you feel like you got

00:48.552 --> 00:51.328
a handle on things, and you-you
don't really have a handle...

00:51.632 --> 00:53.723
No. Okay, what I'm trying to say is,

00:53.790 --> 00:55.024
just that, this morning,

00:55.092 --> 00:57.126
you know, when you
mentioned that you weren't up

00:57.194 --> 00:58.528
for the annual football game

00:58.595 --> 01:00.523
- that we usually do...
- Yeah.

01:00.548 --> 01:03.839
Just got me thinking that,
um, you know, if you feel like

01:03.864 --> 01:05.577
tomorrow might be a little bit too much,

01:05.602 --> 01:06.880
you let me know, and I'll pull the plug.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.169
I appreciate you, man. I'm good.

01:16.591 --> 01:18.091
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:19.215 --> 01:21.116
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:21.775 --> 01:23.356
Huh.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.322
You, uh...

01:26.347 --> 01:28.181
Mold.

01:28.335 --> 01:29.962
What?

01:29.987 --> 01:31.494
Mold. I got mold.

01:31.562 --> 01:33.986
Looked under the sink. I got mold.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.574
Called an expert, comes over.

01:35.599 --> 01:37.686
Long story short, I
need a place to stay.

01:37.711 --> 01:39.278
Six, seven days... a week, tops.

01:39.303 --> 01:40.713
Have we done this before? You had mold,

01:40.737 --> 01:42.004
and you came, and you stayed?

01:42.029 --> 01:44.408
I don't know. I mean, we
live in a-a tropical climate.

01:44.433 --> 01:45.977
You ever consider
maybe you're the issue?

01:46.001 --> 01:46.935
No.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.179
No, I didn't consider that.

01:48.204 --> 01:49.704
I was gonna stay in a hotel...

01:49.729 --> 01:51.082
Okay, good. You can do that.

01:51.107 --> 01:52.150
But then I thought, why would I do that?

01:52.174 --> 01:53.318
Why would I waste all that cash

01:53.342 --> 01:54.619
when my best friend's got an extra room?

01:54.643 --> 01:55.921
No, your-your best friend

01:55.945 --> 01:57.905
doesn't have an extra
room. I'm in the extra room.

01:57.947 --> 02:00.467
Yeah, well, you could sleep
on the couch a couple days.

02:00.492 --> 02:02.456
- Eddie's couch.
- Eddie's a dog.

02:02.885 --> 02:04.479
Dog goes where you put him.

02:04.504 --> 02:05.565
He's just a dog.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.518
Hey. Eddie, don't... He doesn't...

02:07.543 --> 02:09.009
It's your couch.

02:10.386 --> 02:11.587
Look,

02:11.612 --> 02:13.471
of course you're welcome in
my house, all right. It's fine.

02:13.496 --> 02:14.506
I'm just saying, if I'm gonna run

02:14.531 --> 02:16.417
a hostel for team members,

02:16.442 --> 02:18.043
I'm making a chore wheel.

02:18.068 --> 02:19.823
'Cause I'm not picking
up after the two of you.

02:20.153 --> 02:22.120
Okay.
- McGarrett.

02:22.145 --> 02:24.213
Yeah.

02:24.926 --> 02:27.370
No, we're on the way. On the way.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.002
Thank you.

02:36.027 --> 02:39.123
- Hey, what do we got?
- Let's take a little walk.

02:39.155 --> 02:41.256
Victim's name is George Parks.

02:41.281 --> 02:42.925
According to his son, Preston,

02:42.950 --> 02:45.268
George came home a day
early from a business trip.

02:45.863 --> 02:47.197
Gets on the phone with his son

02:47.222 --> 02:48.433
when he gets in because he thinks

02:48.458 --> 02:49.769
there's intruders on the property.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.159
Why didn't he call HPD?

02:51.184 --> 02:52.253
Well, apparently,

02:52.278 --> 02:54.012
that was the advice
that his son gave him,

02:54.037 --> 02:56.190
but, uh, George had other
ideas about how to deal

02:56.215 --> 02:57.615
with the intruders. He went and got

02:57.640 --> 02:59.584
a 12 gauge from his gun cabinet.

02:59.609 --> 03:00.675
I take it that didn't

03:00.700 --> 03:02.444
- work out so well?
- It did not.

03:02.469 --> 03:05.190
At 11:30 p.m., George Parks was killed.

03:05.215 --> 03:06.649
COD was blunt force trauma

03:06.674 --> 03:08.057
to the back of the head.

03:08.082 --> 03:10.485
Having not heard from his
father, Preston gets worried,

03:10.510 --> 03:12.288
he drives to the house...
That's where he sees the body...

03:12.313 --> 03:14.346
- Calls 911.
- Okay.

03:14.371 --> 03:16.401
So what happened?
He interrupt a robbery?

03:16.426 --> 03:20.529
Yes, uh, but not the
kind you would expect.

03:24.182 --> 03:29.182
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by ChrisKe</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">for www.addic7ed.com</font> --

03:58.261 --> 03:59.959
Well, this is a first.

04:00.026 --> 04:01.260
They took the tree.

04:01.604 --> 04:04.119
They took the tree and nothing else.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.588
The thieves didn't even
go inside the house.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.385
The boot prints indicate a crew of four.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.344
And they were smart about
it. They spray-painted

04:09.369 --> 04:12.104
those security cameras, ergo
no footage from last night.

04:12.129 --> 04:14.516
But why would you steal a tree?
I mean, you got

04:14.541 --> 04:16.380
all this nice stuff
inside the house, I assume.

04:16.406 --> 04:17.916
- W-Who would take a tree?
- Don't look at me.

04:17.942 --> 04:19.776
It's not just a tree. It's a koa.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.557
It's highly valuable,
and judging by the size

04:21.581 --> 04:24.183
of its trunk here, I'd say
it's worth upwards of a million.

04:24.293 --> 04:26.628
- Dollars?
- They're very scarce.

04:26.653 --> 04:27.895
The state restricts logging,

04:27.920 --> 04:29.230
which just pushes the
price up even more.

04:29.255 --> 04:31.223
Yeah, that's why koa wood picked up

04:31.248 --> 04:33.326
- the nickname "Hawaiian gold."
- All right, let's put

04:33.351 --> 04:35.986
the ridiculous price of this
tree on the side for a second.

04:36.011 --> 04:38.640
Obviously, you couldn't see
this thing from the street.

04:38.707 --> 04:42.362
So I imagine whoever did this
has been on the property before.

04:42.387 --> 04:44.870
Have you, uh, started looking into staff

04:44.895 --> 04:46.348
or, uh, extended family?

04:46.373 --> 04:48.417
Yeah, I wish it was that simple,
because according to the kids,

04:48.441 --> 04:50.509
George had hundreds of
parties and fundraisers here

04:50.534 --> 04:52.821
over the 50-plus years
he lived at the house.

04:52.846 --> 04:55.080
Okay, so half the island
knows about this tree.

04:55.148 --> 04:56.659
Yeah, and it's a really good thing

04:56.683 --> 04:57.963
Thanksgiving happens every year,

04:58.018 --> 04:59.128
because I don't think we're gonna

04:59.152 --> 05:00.870
make it home in time for this one.

05:06.127 --> 05:07.885
All right, so CSU's still processing,

05:07.910 --> 05:10.565
But so far, no forensics
to help us I.D. our killers.

05:10.590 --> 05:12.659
All right, look, in the
meantime, you don't steal

05:12.684 --> 05:15.018
something like that without a plan
in place to move it. So let's see

05:15.043 --> 05:16.712
if we can find potential buyers.

05:16.737 --> 05:18.237
- On it.
- Yo.

05:18.262 --> 05:19.829
Uh, it's my mom.

05:20.002 --> 05:21.268
Go ahead.

05:21.883 --> 05:23.450
Hello?

05:23.620 --> 05:25.821
What? When?

05:26.045 --> 05:28.151
All right, ca... calm down, Mom.

05:28.176 --> 05:30.135
All right. Let me call you right back.

05:30.605 --> 05:33.007
- She all right?
- My parents' house just got robbed.

05:33.032 --> 05:34.878
- Go. Take Tani with you.
- You sure?

05:34.903 --> 05:37.635
- We have a case.
- It's fine. Lou and Quinn can jump on.

05:37.660 --> 05:38.870
Just go look after your parents

05:38.895 --> 05:40.167
and call us if you need anything.

05:40.192 --> 05:41.807
Make sure he calls, all right?

05:42.184 --> 05:43.417
- Yeah. Come on.
- Let me know.

05:44.857 --> 05:46.625
Look, guys, we know the last thing

05:46.650 --> 05:48.807
you probably want to do
right now is answer questions,

05:48.832 --> 05:50.599
but the bottom line is, whoever did this

05:50.624 --> 05:52.492
knew that your father
was gonna be out of town.

05:52.988 --> 05:55.356
Okay? So, besides the three of you,

05:55.381 --> 05:56.815
who else knew his travel schedule?

05:57.019 --> 05:59.278
Better question is
who didn't know?

05:59.411 --> 06:00.911
Dad always attended

06:00.956 --> 06:03.401
a trade conference in
Singapore over Thanksgiving.

06:03.737 --> 06:05.202
He would give the ground crew

06:05.227 --> 06:07.573
and house staff five days off to,

06:07.621 --> 06:08.956
to be with their families.

06:10.387 --> 06:12.557
- I'm sorry, I just...
- No, it's fine.

06:12.582 --> 06:14.150
Was that something he did regularly?

06:14.175 --> 06:15.643
Let the staff go away, uh...

06:15.853 --> 06:17.821
Uh, yeah. He's been doing
it since we were kids.

06:18.186 --> 06:20.220
So, um, over the years,
you're talking, like,

06:20.351 --> 06:22.285
50 to 100 people who knew he'd be gone.

06:22.310 --> 06:24.120
Okay, well, we're
gonna need those names.

06:24.145 --> 06:25.807
- Yes. All right.
- And also, anybody else you

06:25.832 --> 06:28.909
can think of. Extended family or friends
who had access to this place.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.650
Your father and I were only
gone for maybe 30 minutes.

06:36.675 --> 06:38.943
We went by the market
to pick up a few things,

06:38.968 --> 06:40.235
and when we got back...

06:40.450 --> 06:42.877
- Look at this mess.
- It's okay, Ma.

06:43.284 --> 06:44.620
All right?

06:45.133 --> 06:46.467
Where's Dad?

06:46.492 --> 06:49.635
He's at the hardware
store to get some supplies

06:49.660 --> 06:51.160
and n-new doors.

06:54.193 --> 06:55.661
Dad doesn't know I'm here.

06:57.145 --> 06:58.712
He told me not to bother you.

06:58.737 --> 07:01.472
- To let the police handle it.
- Okay. Mm.

07:01.939 --> 07:03.438
Mrs. Reigns,

07:03.463 --> 07:05.331
why don't you walk us
through what was taken?

07:05.434 --> 07:08.498
Uh, not much in here.

07:08.523 --> 07:10.458
Just an old laptop.

07:10.483 --> 07:11.745
Natano's radio.

07:11.770 --> 07:14.172
Wait, but they didn't take the TV

07:14.197 --> 07:15.564
or the DVD player.

07:15.943 --> 07:17.377
Did they get your jewelry?

07:18.318 --> 07:19.952
It's worse than that.

07:24.037 --> 07:27.680
They also took your dad's cigar
box, with all his valuables.

07:28.418 --> 07:29.986
Just promise

07:30.011 --> 07:31.679
you won't tell my dad.

07:36.895 --> 07:38.562
Uh, Mrs. Reigns,

07:38.587 --> 07:40.521
I promise you we're
gonna do everything we can

07:40.546 --> 07:42.113
to get your property back.

07:42.224 --> 07:43.479
Thank you.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.885
Right, Joons?

07:49.503 --> 07:51.008
I've been sniffing 
around the black market

07:51.033 --> 07:51.995
for koa wood.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.155
- Mm.
- Come to find out there's some guy

07:54.180 --> 07:55.457
who sells trinkets made of the stuff.

07:55.482 --> 07:58.143
He's operating out of some
tourist trap in Waikele.

07:58.191 --> 08:00.426
- Okay.
- He goes by the name

08:00.451 --> 08:01.551
of Lolo Joe.

08:01.576 --> 08:03.698
- Ah. Sounds reputable.
- Oh, yeah.

08:04.312 --> 08:08.792
Thing is this: when everybody
else is out of koa wood,

08:09.026 --> 08:12.862
this cat always has cords
of the stuff lying around.

08:12.887 --> 08:14.188
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:14.422 --> 08:16.932
Why don't you and Quinn
go pay him a visit?

08:16.957 --> 08:18.758
Yes, sir.

08:20.213 --> 08:23.139
Okay. Thanks, Duke.

08:23.164 --> 08:25.399
Yeah, keep us posted.

08:25.424 --> 08:26.858
Okay, bye.

08:26.883 --> 08:30.222
All right. HPD's canvassing pawn
shops for your parents' stuff.

08:34.178 --> 08:36.212
Joons, you know, that...

08:36.648 --> 08:39.616
that look you had on your
face at the house, um...

08:41.652 --> 08:43.419
Do you think you know who did this?

08:43.445 --> 08:45.012
Yeah.

08:45.295 --> 08:48.432
No one outside my family
knows my parents' stash spot...

08:49.290 --> 08:51.581
except for my hanai brother Owen.

08:51.942 --> 08:54.143
I didn't know your
parents took someone in.

08:54.168 --> 08:56.784
Yeah. He was my best friend growing up.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.431
We were eight years old and...

09:00.788 --> 09:02.889
he'd turn up to class
wearing the same thing

09:02.914 --> 09:04.715
three days in a row.

09:04.849 --> 09:07.784
Come to find out that, uh,
his mom had been arrested

09:08.525 --> 09:10.626
and he was living by himself.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.214
An eight-year-old.

09:13.056 --> 09:15.456
I told my parents. They took him in.

09:15.481 --> 09:17.249
He lived with us for about a year.

09:17.572 --> 09:19.573
Then his mom got sober
and demanded that he move

09:19.598 --> 09:22.232
back in with her. Maybe it wasn't him.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.886
Burglars, they...

09:23.911 --> 09:25.922
They typically look for
hiding spots just like that.

09:25.947 --> 09:28.549
No, no. This was a
targeted smash-and-grab.

09:28.675 --> 09:30.809
Whoever did this knew exactly
what they were going for

09:30.834 --> 09:32.276
and where to find it.

09:33.409 --> 09:34.841
You want to know the worst bit?

09:36.336 --> 09:37.970
I'm the one who showed it to him.

09:40.733 --> 09:43.067
We were about, like, uh, 11 years old,

09:43.147 --> 09:45.415
and I was bragging about
my dad's Purple Heart.

09:45.998 --> 09:48.106
You know, I grabbed it, pulled
it out, waving the thing around

09:48.131 --> 09:49.475
like-like it was some sort
of trophy or something.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.591
I was such... an idiot.

09:52.989 --> 09:54.130
My dad had put it

09:54.155 --> 09:56.208
in a box because it was so
painful for him to look at.

09:57.826 --> 09:59.093
Owen must have seen

09:59.118 --> 10:00.427
the other things in the box.

10:00.452 --> 10:02.672
Like my dad's gold watch that he got

10:02.697 --> 10:03.631
when he was pensioned

10:03.656 --> 10:05.755
from his construction job.

10:07.202 --> 10:08.636
He must have gone for the watch

10:08.703 --> 10:10.823
and just grabbed everything
else because it was there.

10:13.352 --> 10:17.489
Well, the thing is,
addiction is genetic.

10:18.923 --> 10:20.778
I dodged that bullet,

10:21.598 --> 10:25.356
but I'm-I'm guessing
Owen wasn't so lucky?

10:25.923 --> 10:27.357
No.

10:27.382 --> 10:30.017
All right.

10:30.042 --> 10:31.643
Take it you don't know where he lives

10:31.668 --> 10:33.569
or hangs out these days.

10:33.594 --> 10:35.091
No.

10:35.455 --> 10:37.323
But I know where to start.

10:47.107 --> 10:48.451
Well, look-y here, Officer Liu.

10:49.303 --> 10:52.381
This is a damn smorgasbord
of koa wood, isn't it?

10:52.664 --> 10:54.575
Thought this stuff was
supposed to be hard to come by?

10:55.159 --> 10:57.584
- Like finding water in a desert.
- Yeah.

10:57.609 --> 10:59.334
Or a mailman at a dog park.

10:59.374 --> 11:01.175
Can I help you with something?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.920
Or are you just practicing
for open mic night

11:02.945 --> 11:04.379
at the Laugh Emporium?

11:04.404 --> 11:06.178
- Everybody's a critic.
- Mm-hmm.

11:06.203 --> 11:07.398
Uh, we're with Five-O.

11:07.655 --> 11:08.956
We're looking into the illicit

11:08.981 --> 11:10.549
koa wood trade here on the island.

11:10.574 --> 11:11.852
When it comes to that sort of thing,

11:11.877 --> 11:14.464
everybody tells us
that, uh, you the man.

11:15.436 --> 11:16.858
What's this really about?

11:16.967 --> 11:18.268
You know, somebody stole

11:18.293 --> 11:19.727
a whole koa wood tree

11:19.752 --> 11:21.986
from a private residence last night.

11:22.011 --> 11:23.612
And then they killed the owner.

11:23.637 --> 11:26.147
So we figure you may
know something about it.

11:28.087 --> 11:31.194
All right, look.
I didn't know anybody was gonna die.

11:31.616 --> 11:33.383
But yes.

11:33.408 --> 11:35.119
Some guys approached me and
said they were coming into

11:35.144 --> 11:37.295
a big supply of koa.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.022
I didn't get their names,

11:39.047 --> 11:41.382
but I am supposed to meet
with them in about an hour.

11:41.407 --> 11:42.440
Where?

12:01.169 --> 12:02.536
Stay on that door.

12:02.561 --> 12:04.845
- Five-O!
- Breach.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.459
Go around back!

12:13.262 --> 12:15.997
Four dead. Chainsaws.

12:16.022 --> 12:18.085
This is definitely the
crew that stole the koa.

12:18.110 --> 12:20.235
Yeah, but the wood's still here.

12:20.260 --> 12:21.927
What were they killed for?

12:26.822 --> 12:28.056
- Hey.
- Hmm.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.916
Heard we got something.

12:29.941 --> 12:33.737
Sure did. For starters, we
identified the men in the warehouse.

12:33.762 --> 12:35.913
Three of them have records,
including for B and Es.

12:35.938 --> 12:38.039
The fourth guy, a
Daniel Malapit, is clean.

12:38.064 --> 12:39.773
However, up until six months ago,

12:39.798 --> 12:41.217
he was working as a gardener for,

12:41.242 --> 12:43.777
- you guessed it, George Parks.
- Malapit knew

12:43.802 --> 12:45.379
the tree was there and
how much it was worth,

12:45.403 --> 12:47.938
so he puts together a crew to go get it

12:47.963 --> 12:49.845
- when he thinks Parks is out of town.
- And there's more.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.610
CSU found George Parks's
blood on one of our dead perps.

12:52.635 --> 12:56.547
Okay, so the gardener and his crew
killed Parks. Who killed them?

12:56.572 --> 12:58.992
Well, unfortunately,
ballistics came back

12:59.017 --> 13:01.970
inconclusive, because the
gun used in those murders

13:01.995 --> 13:03.229
wasn't in the system.

13:03.254 --> 13:05.522
Okay, so fresh off of this robbery,

13:05.547 --> 13:06.981
all these guys are taken out,

13:07.006 --> 13:09.269
but whoever killed them,
for whatever reason,

13:09.294 --> 13:11.806
decided to leave all
the valuable wood behind?

13:11.831 --> 13:13.640
Well, actually, not all the wood.

13:13.665 --> 13:15.132
When CSU was processing,

13:15.157 --> 13:17.091
they discovered that one section

13:17.116 --> 13:19.751
of the koa tree was
missing, so I compared

13:19.776 --> 13:21.857
these images from CSU

13:21.882 --> 13:25.518
with this old photo of the
tree, and check this out.

13:25.543 --> 13:28.923
The section that was taken
has this large cavity in it.

13:28.948 --> 13:30.657
I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

13:30.682 --> 13:32.571
and say that, uh, that
ain't no coincidence.

13:32.596 --> 13:33.829
Which got us thinking...

13:33.975 --> 13:36.710
what if this hole was
being used as a stash spot?

13:36.735 --> 13:38.731
So maybe it wasn't actually
about the tree itself,

13:38.756 --> 13:40.656
but what was being hidden inside of it.

13:40.681 --> 13:42.782
And maybe that's why someone
was desperate enough to

13:42.807 --> 13:45.608
- track these guys down and kill them.
- It's a theory.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.981
All right, let's CSU back
to look at that tree again.

13:48.006 --> 13:49.759
Make sure we're not missing anything.

13:50.124 --> 13:51.791
And if you're right about

13:51.816 --> 13:53.450
the stash spot of it all,

13:53.475 --> 13:56.911
the only way I'm hiding something
valuable in a tree is if it's on

13:56.936 --> 13:58.704
- my property.
- Which leaves

13:58.729 --> 14:00.712
our victim, George Parks.

14:00.737 --> 14:03.014
And his three kids.

14:10.063 --> 14:12.765
Junior. Long time.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.048
Mrs. Ocampo, is Owen home?

14:15.073 --> 14:18.431
Oh, now you're police, so
it's Mrs. Ocampo, is it?

14:18.832 --> 14:20.466
Owen's not here.

14:23.858 --> 14:25.923
Go ahead. See for yourself.

14:31.416 --> 14:33.117
When was the last time you saw Owen?

14:33.467 --> 14:35.868
He came over about
three or four days ago.

14:36.060 --> 14:38.595
I gave him a hundred dollars to score.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.021
He brought back 50 bucks of crap.

14:43.420 --> 14:45.063
Go ahead, Junior, say it.

14:45.088 --> 14:46.321
You and that family of yours

14:46.346 --> 14:48.188
always thought you were better than us.

14:49.368 --> 14:52.570
Did he tell you how they
took my son away from me?

14:52.795 --> 14:54.229
That would be how you

14:54.422 --> 14:56.022
remember it. Doesn't make it true.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.791
Look, you don't want us here,

14:57.816 --> 14:59.350
and frankly, the feeling's mutual.

14:59.375 --> 15:02.298
So why don't you just tell us
where did Owen score? Who is his dealer?

15:02.323 --> 15:04.291
If I knew that, I would've gone myself,

15:04.316 --> 15:06.290
instead of giving my son
the chance to rip me off.

15:10.970 --> 15:13.149
So, uh, that's everything.

15:13.174 --> 15:15.376
I got better things to do
than talk to cops all day.

15:20.291 --> 15:23.137
Do you even care
that Owen might be in trouble?

15:23.162 --> 15:24.767
Owen's always in trouble.

15:25.130 --> 15:26.946
When you see my kolohe son,

15:26.971 --> 15:28.845
tell him he owes me 50 bucks.

15:30.405 --> 15:32.618
Well, I'm ready to crown
her mother of the year.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.673
Joons, I'm s... I'm sorry, I was
just trying to lighten the mood.

15:39.698 --> 15:41.899
No. Don't apologize. I appreciate it.

15:43.546 --> 15:45.213
You know, it's just...

15:45.532 --> 15:49.282
seeing his mom again
is... Takes me back.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.962
You know, when Owen used to
live with us, he was doing great.

15:54.116 --> 15:55.816
We were in Little League together.

15:57.084 --> 15:58.782
You know, he was doing great in school.

16:00.658 --> 16:02.459
But with a mom like that...

16:05.123 --> 16:07.591
he never stood a chance.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.851
Well, your family was there for him.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.021
You did what you could.

16:15.163 --> 16:16.797
Tani, I can't tell you how many times

16:16.822 --> 16:18.823
I tried to get Owen into rehab.

16:20.190 --> 16:22.025
He turned me down every time.

16:22.546 --> 16:26.282
To the point where I just,
you know, I stopped offering.

16:27.688 --> 16:29.588
Maybe that was my mistake.

16:31.205 --> 16:33.540
I mean, you never gave
up on your brother.

16:36.564 --> 16:38.433
Here's what I know about addicts...

16:39.912 --> 16:42.079
you can keep trying all you want.

16:42.452 --> 16:45.688
But until they're ready to take
responsibility for themselves,

16:45.903 --> 16:48.505
no amount of help is
gonna get them clean.

16:54.148 --> 16:55.348
Speaking of Koa...

16:55.674 --> 16:57.775
I texted him a picture
of the bag of happies

16:57.800 --> 16:59.066
I saw on the table.

16:59.091 --> 17:00.851
I thought he could show
it around the clinic,

17:00.876 --> 17:02.354
see if anyone knew where it came from.

17:02.379 --> 17:03.574
Boy, did he come through.

17:03.599 --> 17:05.214
"Check Ala Moana Beach Park.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.558
The guy under the park
shelter sells the stuff."

17:13.780 --> 17:15.113
Hi.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.838
What's that?

17:17.863 --> 17:19.763
What does it look like?

17:19.789 --> 17:22.257
This is highly suspicious behavior.

17:22.281 --> 17:23.425
- What's going on?
- It's a coffee.

17:23.451 --> 17:25.417
I'm bringing my landlord
a nice cup of coffee.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.417
Okay. You're not getting the guest room.

17:27.443 --> 17:29.926
And you don't have to have the
coffee. I just came here to tell you

17:29.951 --> 17:31.465
that we are looking
into the Parks kids...

17:31.490 --> 17:32.901
Alibis, phone records from last night.

17:32.934 --> 17:34.968
- That's all.
- All right.

17:34.993 --> 17:37.104
Do me a favor, just take it
easy on the caffeine, all right?

17:37.129 --> 17:39.241
You know you get all jittery
and stupid when you drink

17:39.266 --> 17:42.034
- too much coffee.
- Hey, guys, we just caught a break.

17:42.059 --> 17:43.871
CSU was processing the koa tree

17:43.896 --> 17:47.517
and found an earring lodged in
the lower section of the trunk.

17:47.542 --> 17:50.778
DNA on it popped for a Jane
Doe cold case from 15 years ago.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.270
Is this gonna be disgusting?

17:54.235 --> 17:55.435
- Yes.
- "Jane Doe, age 15

17:55.460 --> 17:57.862
"to 20, murdered and dismembered.

17:57.972 --> 17:59.739
"Some, but not all

17:59.764 --> 18:02.027
"of the body parts were
found in burial sites

18:02.052 --> 18:03.262
in Pupukea-Paumalu Forest Reserve."

18:03.287 --> 18:06.189
- So, they chopped her up.
- Uh, it turns out

18:06.214 --> 18:09.191
the head was the only part
that was never recovered.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.241
So it's possible we just
found what was inside that tree.

18:12.266 --> 18:13.441
Yeah.

18:29.292 --> 18:31.527
Okay, wait. Hold on, hold on.

18:31.552 --> 18:33.153
Are you good?

18:33.178 --> 18:35.277
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.551
Junior.

18:45.897 --> 18:47.398
Beat it.

18:49.019 --> 18:50.889
How is it, brother-man?

18:51.371 --> 18:52.738
You know, it's been, been a while

18:52.763 --> 18:54.043
since we hung out and stuff, bro.

18:54.068 --> 18:57.537
Yeah. No, no, don't do that,
okay? You know why I'm here.

18:57.562 --> 19:01.105
J... man, I'm, uh...

19:01.130 --> 19:04.993
I'm sorry. Okay? I... I was hurting,

19:05.018 --> 19:07.844
- and I didn't...
- Where's the stuff you stole?

19:09.722 --> 19:10.822
Where'd you pawn it?

19:11.101 --> 19:14.918
Oh... it's the spot on Mokauea.

19:18.917 --> 19:20.651
You were my brother, man.

19:21.701 --> 19:23.535
My parents took you in.

19:24.979 --> 19:27.886
How? How could you do that?

19:30.385 --> 19:31.996
My dad's Purple Heart?

19:32.021 --> 19:33.833
No-no-no-no, I-I wouldn't,
I wouldn't sell that.

19:34.047 --> 19:36.363
It's still in the, in the
cigar box. I got it.

19:36.388 --> 19:37.540
Yeah? Where?

19:37.565 --> 19:40.868
Um, it's at the motel I'm crashing at.

19:40.893 --> 19:42.402
I can take you there.

19:45.412 --> 19:47.113
Empty your pockets.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.897
Do it.

19:55.366 --> 19:58.901
What's this? What's this?

19:58.938 --> 20:02.140
- Hmm? Yeah.
- No! Stop!

20:02.165 --> 20:04.160
Get up. Get up.

20:04.551 --> 20:08.666
See, we spent this whole day trying
to find your ass before HPD did.

20:08.691 --> 20:12.019
Forget about the robbery. Having
that stuff right there can send you

20:12.044 --> 20:13.816
- away for a long time in Halawa.
- I know.

20:13.841 --> 20:14.841
- Yeah, you know?
- I know.

20:14.866 --> 20:16.277
Well, you don't act
like someone who knows.

20:16.431 --> 20:18.132
You act like someone who doesn't care

20:18.157 --> 20:19.707
if they live or they die, man.

20:26.532 --> 20:28.100
You have two options.

20:29.998 --> 20:32.533
You come with me and I turn
you in for the robbery...

20:34.670 --> 20:36.304
or you go to rehab.

20:39.712 --> 20:41.965
My brother works for a rehab clinic.

20:42.886 --> 20:44.320
There's a spot there for you.

20:45.230 --> 20:47.380
But you have to agree to go today.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.596
Just say yes.

20:49.621 --> 20:51.956
All you got to do is say yes.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.395
Hey, credit where it's due.

20:58.420 --> 21:01.105
Whichever sibling killed our Jane Doe

21:01.130 --> 21:03.368
was smart to hide the head
in a state-protected tree

21:03.393 --> 21:04.684
on private property.

21:04.709 --> 21:06.176
Well, why hold on to the head at all?

21:06.405 --> 21:10.107
Was the killer keeping it
for some kind of sick trophy?

21:10.132 --> 21:11.799
Well, think about it practically, right?

21:11.824 --> 21:15.256
A teenage girl is probably not
gonna have prints in the system,

21:15.281 --> 21:16.790
but she's gonna have dental records.

21:16.815 --> 21:18.326
Well, that would explain why you'd want

21:18.351 --> 21:20.095
- to keep the skull close.
- Right. And it would've worked

21:20.119 --> 21:22.347
if the... chainsaw people 
didn't come around.

21:22.372 --> 21:24.849
All right, so, 15 years ago,

21:24.874 --> 21:27.943
Darren, Preston and Olivia
were living at the house

21:27.968 --> 21:29.235
at the time of the murder.

21:29.987 --> 21:31.821
Tell you who I like for this thing.

21:32.872 --> 21:36.568
I did a little deeper dive
into Larry, Moe and Girly's

21:36.593 --> 21:37.893
phone records.

21:38.004 --> 21:40.958
Boy, I got a story to tell you.

21:43.442 --> 21:45.286
All right, Preston, we're
gonna get right to it,

21:45.311 --> 21:47.045
because we already know you lied to us.

21:47.155 --> 21:48.689
Lied to you? About what?

21:48.714 --> 21:50.559
Well, for starters, your timeline.

21:51.622 --> 21:53.318
You said that when your
father didn't answer the phone,

21:53.343 --> 21:55.210
you went right to his place.

21:55.235 --> 21:57.598
And when you got there, you called 911.

21:57.623 --> 22:01.293
Problem is, there's 45
minutes between the last time

22:01.360 --> 22:03.762
you tried him and that 911 call.

22:03.787 --> 22:05.754
Yeah, that kind of strikes me as odd.

22:05.786 --> 22:08.042
- Yeah.
- I mean, that time of night,

22:08.067 --> 22:09.610
no traffic on the road...

22:09.635 --> 22:10.936
- Mm.
- And you live

22:11.825 --> 22:15.774
maybe 15 minutes away from
your father's house, tops.

22:16.442 --> 22:19.028
Now, I ain't no math major, but, uh,

22:19.053 --> 22:20.693
that sounds like 30
minutes missing to me.

22:20.976 --> 22:22.911
So what happened in that
half an hour, Preston?

22:24.309 --> 22:26.027
See, I think that left you

22:26.052 --> 22:27.619
just enough time

22:27.644 --> 22:29.511
to get over to that warehouse

22:29.536 --> 22:31.003
and kill those guys

22:31.028 --> 22:32.630
- who stole your father's...
- Whoa, whoa. W-Wait, I didn't...

22:32.655 --> 22:34.759
What? Who do you think
you're talking to?!

22:34.784 --> 22:37.039
You needed to get at that
tree so you could grab

22:37.063 --> 22:38.708
that skull you stashed there

22:38.733 --> 22:40.200
- 15 years back.
- Skull?

22:40.225 --> 22:41.528
- What-what skull?
- This one.

22:42.246 --> 22:44.885
It's amazing what sniffer dogs can find.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.839
Yeah. Found this, too. See that?

22:48.352 --> 22:50.177
One of her earrings.

22:56.983 --> 22:59.184
Tell us who she was.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.124
Her name was...

23:06.410 --> 23:08.215
was Lena.

23:09.505 --> 23:10.996
Lena Schmidt.

23:11.305 --> 23:13.058
She was a backpacker.

23:13.388 --> 23:15.270
From Germany. Okay?

23:16.068 --> 23:19.317
I met her at-at a beach
party, and I brought her home.

23:20.411 --> 23:21.616
This poor

23:21.641 --> 23:24.825
young woman, who'd been sleeping
in tents and youth hostels.

23:26.286 --> 23:28.980
Until along comes little Richie Rich

23:29.372 --> 23:31.739
with just the thing to impress her,

23:32.456 --> 23:34.357
his daddy's huge estate.

23:34.525 --> 23:35.826
Anyone else at the house?

23:36.088 --> 23:37.247
No.

23:37.757 --> 23:40.075
My dad was out of town, and so...

23:40.426 --> 23:41.763
none of the staff were around.

23:44.122 --> 23:45.564
Liv and Darren were...

23:45.674 --> 23:47.108
at the movies.

23:47.133 --> 23:48.533
So, with just you and Lena then,

23:48.558 --> 23:49.744
guess you decided to
have a little party.

23:49.769 --> 23:51.970
Huh? A little drinking.

23:52.294 --> 23:54.439
Drugs, too, I imagine.

23:54.507 --> 23:55.903
Yeah.

23:58.364 --> 23:59.820
We were just messing around.

24:00.138 --> 24:01.947
And then... and then I...

24:02.014 --> 24:03.815
I just... I-I jokingly...

24:03.926 --> 24:05.126
I pushed her into the pool,

24:05.151 --> 24:07.755
and then, uh, she hit her head.

24:08.653 --> 24:10.555
And I... I didn't mean for it to happen.

24:10.623 --> 24:11.957
But you did mean

24:12.024 --> 24:13.168
to cut her body into little pieces

24:13.192 --> 24:14.659
and scatter her around the forest.

24:15.887 --> 24:16.987
Just so we're clear.

24:23.169 --> 24:24.364
I panicked.

24:25.692 --> 24:26.824
And...

24:28.241 --> 24:29.908
That kind of scandal, I...

24:29.976 --> 24:33.067
didn't want my mistake
to ruin my father.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.256
And so I...

24:35.927 --> 24:38.083
I took care of the problem.

24:38.150 --> 24:39.417
"Problem."

24:40.617 --> 24:42.951
I guess that's one way to put it.

24:46.559 --> 24:48.192
We're not done, Preston.

24:48.450 --> 24:51.552
We're gonna need you to walk
us through the last 15 hours.

24:51.940 --> 24:53.763
And don't leave out any details.

25:01.974 --> 25:03.575
Well, did he buy it?

25:03.600 --> 25:05.467
Oh, he bought it all right.

25:05.492 --> 25:06.992
Surprised it worked.

25:07.017 --> 25:08.656
This one here's a regular Meryl Streep.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.218
Oh, yeah?

25:10.243 --> 25:12.111
Where'd you get this idea anyway?

25:12.136 --> 25:13.852
Hamlet, tenth grade English.

25:13.962 --> 25:16.339
And shout-out to Noelani
for supplying the prop.

25:16.364 --> 25:19.291
Hmm. So did Preston give up the location

25:19.316 --> 25:21.417
- of the real skull?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

25:21.442 --> 25:22.943
Since he thought we already found it,

25:22.968 --> 25:24.946
he didn't think twice about
telling us where he tossed it.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.831
In the Ala Wai Canal, off McCully.

25:26.856 --> 25:28.109
I'm gonna get CSU on it.

25:28.134 --> 25:29.343
Have them take the
skull out of the water.

25:29.368 --> 25:30.601
All right.

25:30.786 --> 25:33.757
Uh-oh, I know that
look. What's up, Lou?

25:33.794 --> 25:36.155
I don't know about
you, but I don't think

25:36.180 --> 25:38.081
I'm buying this kid's confession.

25:38.772 --> 25:41.944
He went right to the waterworks
as soon as he saw this thing.

25:41.969 --> 25:44.659
That kind of reaction?
I mean, look at him.

25:44.684 --> 25:46.851
Do you really think this
kid is the kind to go around

25:46.876 --> 25:49.478
chopping up backpackers, and
then spreading their parts

25:49.503 --> 25:51.404
all over the island
like Johnny Bodyseed?

25:52.257 --> 25:56.336
One, thank you for the
vivid imagery, and two,

25:56.361 --> 25:57.928
I'm inclined to agree.

25:57.953 --> 25:59.320
But the question is,

25:59.345 --> 26:02.296
if Preston didn't do it, then
who is he protecting, and why?

26:04.145 --> 26:05.921
I couldn't sell a Purple Heart.

26:08.041 --> 26:11.272
Your pop, man, h-he...
he was so good to me

26:11.297 --> 26:12.998
back in the day.

26:15.829 --> 26:19.698
I'm sorry... for everything.

26:20.390 --> 26:22.179
It's all about what you do next.

26:23.018 --> 26:24.352
All right?

26:46.332 --> 26:48.133
I'm proud of you, Joons.

26:52.899 --> 26:54.322
These letters...

26:55.213 --> 26:57.775
they have military stamps.

26:59.492 --> 27:00.978
They're from Afghanistan.

27:01.213 --> 27:03.638
Did you write those to your dad
while you were stationed there?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.689
No, I've never seen them before.

27:25.551 --> 27:27.439
These are the remains of Lena Schmidt,

27:27.464 --> 27:29.799
including the skull that CSU
just pulled out of the canal.

27:29.824 --> 27:31.057
Problem is,

27:31.082 --> 27:32.516
your guy that confessed,

27:32.541 --> 27:33.908
he and Lena's cranium

27:33.933 --> 27:35.834
are telling two very different stories.

27:35.859 --> 27:36.955
Is that so?

27:37.346 --> 27:39.236
Well, by all means, elaborate.

27:39.261 --> 27:40.611
Well, Lena was definitely wounded

27:40.636 --> 27:42.404
and quite possibly unconscious

27:42.429 --> 27:44.355
after the fall your suspect described,

27:44.380 --> 27:46.471
but that's not what killed her.

27:47.283 --> 27:49.641
Here's where her head
struck the lip of the pool.

27:49.666 --> 27:50.783
Mm-hmm.

27:50.808 --> 27:52.947
But these three depressed fractures...

27:52.972 --> 27:54.906
Here, here and here...

27:54.931 --> 27:57.619
On the other side of the
skull, that's what killed her.

27:57.644 --> 27:59.212
So this was no accident.

27:59.432 --> 28:01.322
This was cold-blooded murder.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.607
I didn't make Preston
Parks for a murderer before,

28:03.632 --> 28:05.055
and I still don't.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.933
And besides, if Preston was guilty,

28:06.958 --> 28:08.202
he would have known the cause of death.

28:08.227 --> 28:09.711
So the fake skull
wouldn't have fooled him.

28:09.736 --> 28:12.740
Then why confess to a
murder you didn't commit?

28:12.960 --> 28:15.895
Unless you're covering for
someone else in your family.

28:19.159 --> 28:20.985
I know you wanted to talk to the family,

28:21.010 --> 28:23.493
but I'm afraid Preston isn't here.

28:23.518 --> 28:26.453
Frankly, I'm worried. He
hasn't been answering my calls.

28:26.478 --> 28:28.713
Oh, that's 'cause, uh, he's with us.

28:29.111 --> 28:31.249
- Why?
- Lena Schmidt.

28:31.359 --> 28:32.493
Who?

28:32.518 --> 28:34.285
The woman who was
murdered here 15 years ago,

28:34.310 --> 28:35.329
that's who.

28:36.135 --> 28:37.622
I'm sorry, what?

28:37.647 --> 28:40.601
Oh, stop it. Preston already
confessed to the murder.

28:41.103 --> 28:43.027
But we don't believe his confession

28:43.052 --> 28:45.150
'cause he didn't even
know how the girl died.

28:45.776 --> 28:46.910
But we think you do.

28:46.977 --> 28:49.713
- Olivia?
- Not now, Diane.

28:49.738 --> 28:52.017
You want to do this in front
of Diane and the whole family?

28:52.125 --> 28:54.593
Or you want to get 'em
out of here? Your call.

28:54.661 --> 28:56.696
Diane, take everyone outside, please.

28:56.807 --> 28:59.689
Absolutely. Come on, guys.

28:59.714 --> 29:01.791
- Let's give them some privacy.
- How dare you.

29:01.816 --> 29:04.069
Coming in here with
these preposterous lies.

29:04.094 --> 29:05.404
It's bad enough that
our family Thanksgiving

29:05.429 --> 29:07.330
was turned into a wake.

29:07.650 --> 29:10.076
- And now this?
- Oh, this is just the start.

29:10.510 --> 29:11.668
That's enough.

29:11.779 --> 29:13.913
Get out. If you want
to say another word,

29:14.236 --> 29:15.346
you can say it to our lawyers.

29:15.371 --> 29:17.471
Damn it, just tell the truth.

29:20.578 --> 29:22.212
For 15 years,

29:22.321 --> 29:24.256
you let me think that I was a murderer.

29:24.281 --> 29:26.611
That I was responsible,
that I killed her.

29:28.893 --> 29:30.394
When I pulled her out of the pool,

29:30.630 --> 29:32.798
I thought she was dead.

29:32.823 --> 29:33.957
Help!

29:34.486 --> 29:36.769
Lena...

29:37.208 --> 29:38.842
I was a mess.

29:40.598 --> 29:42.142
You said that you would take care of it.

29:42.166 --> 29:43.099
It's gonna be okay.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.567
So you just gave me some pills

29:44.592 --> 29:45.692
and you sent me to bed.

29:46.291 --> 29:48.064
But she wasn't dead...

29:49.229 --> 29:50.396
was she?

29:53.877 --> 29:55.643
Instead of calling an ambulance,

29:55.668 --> 29:57.580
you just... you just finished her off.

30:00.426 --> 30:01.689
You sound insane.

30:01.791 --> 30:03.858
Why... why would we do that?

30:04.020 --> 30:05.464
How 'bout we begin with the fact

30:05.489 --> 30:08.658
that all of you here were
drinking and using illegal drugs.

30:08.683 --> 30:10.394
Plus, there was the
potential manslaughter charge

30:10.419 --> 30:11.753
on deck for Preston

30:11.778 --> 30:13.679
- if she didn't survive.
- And if she did,

30:13.704 --> 30:15.131
well, that leaves this family

30:15.156 --> 30:17.491
wide open for a multimillion dollar

30:17.516 --> 30:20.618
civil suit from Lena's
family back in Germany.

30:20.771 --> 30:21.971
All of which would damage

30:22.006 --> 30:23.869
your father's good name and fortune.

30:24.259 --> 30:25.916
Not to mention your inheritance.

30:25.941 --> 30:29.546
I thought you did this
amazing thing for me.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.830
That you put yourself
on the line to cover up

30:31.855 --> 30:34.525
for my stupid, horrible mistake.

30:35.762 --> 30:37.129
So when they picked me up today,

30:37.497 --> 30:40.399
I confessed to protect you.

30:41.842 --> 30:43.476
Now that I know the truth,

30:44.330 --> 30:47.682
I'm done. I'm done.

30:48.999 --> 30:50.533
She could have lived,

30:51.416 --> 30:52.705
but you killed her.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.587
You killed her.

30:57.241 --> 30:58.385
All right, turn around

30:58.409 --> 30:59.809
and face the fruit salad.

31:01.069 --> 31:03.604
You're under arrest for
the murder of Lena Schmidt.

31:03.957 --> 31:05.057
Let's go.

31:14.308 --> 31:16.109
What do you say, Duke?

31:16.419 --> 31:19.081
How'd it go with that warrant
at Darren Parks's house?

31:19.106 --> 31:22.241
Found a dismantled AR-15
stashed in the garden shed.

31:22.266 --> 31:24.377
Ballistics already linked
the bullets to the warehouse.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.003
Did you get the real
timeline for last night?

31:27.114 --> 31:29.048
Yeah, Preston did come straight here,

31:29.073 --> 31:31.260
saw his dad's body in
the grass, like he said,

31:31.285 --> 31:33.853
but he also saw the
tree theft in progress.

31:33.878 --> 31:35.297
That's when he texted the sister.

31:35.322 --> 31:36.889
She told him to follow the truck

31:36.914 --> 31:38.520
at a distance, see where
they were taking the wood.

31:38.545 --> 31:40.969
When Preston got there,
he gave Olivia the address,

31:40.994 --> 31:42.962
then came back here to call 911.

31:42.987 --> 31:44.798
Meanwhile, Darren heads 
over to the warehouse

31:44.822 --> 31:46.723
and shoots those guys up.

31:46.833 --> 31:49.325
Then he hooks back up with
Olivia, and they both go

31:49.350 --> 31:50.650
to dump the skull in the Ala Wai.

31:50.928 --> 31:53.897
Well... doesn't seem like

31:53.922 --> 31:56.724
the Parks family has a lot
to be thankful for this year.

32:13.631 --> 32:16.622
_

32:24.528 --> 32:25.695
For you.

32:30.868 --> 32:32.098
Your mom's things?

32:32.671 --> 32:34.672
Yeah, my partner's getting them now.

32:35.915 --> 32:37.161
Who did this?

32:37.942 --> 32:40.239
Couple of nobodies, Tweakers.

32:41.364 --> 32:42.545
Thank you.

32:43.354 --> 32:44.668
Of course.

32:47.985 --> 32:49.583
New doors look good.

32:49.608 --> 32:51.375
Yeah, glass is double-paned.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.747
Nice, nice.

32:57.128 --> 32:58.795
I saw the letters.

33:03.026 --> 33:05.444
You told me not to write
you from deployment.

33:05.585 --> 33:08.320
Said you didn't want to know
what was going on with me.

33:09.995 --> 33:12.604
But now I find out that,
uh, this whole time,

33:12.629 --> 33:14.104
you got my C.O. to write you.

33:14.819 --> 33:16.386
You were keeping tabs on me.

33:22.213 --> 33:25.307
Look, I know you're not big
on telling people how you feel,

33:26.520 --> 33:29.268
but these letters, they,
uh, they tell me plenty.

33:31.503 --> 33:33.573
And I can see you've read
them a bunch of times.

33:35.833 --> 33:37.416
You know what this says to me?

33:38.591 --> 33:40.799
Says to me that me and
you still have a shot.

33:43.618 --> 33:46.605
So I'm never gonna stop trying to
make things right with you, Dad.

33:48.393 --> 33:50.143
And I know you're mad
at me for what I did

33:50.168 --> 33:52.758
at the parole hearing, but
I just want... just, like,

33:52.783 --> 33:54.651
let me explain to you...

33:55.159 --> 33:58.731
I wasn't angry at you.
I was angry at myself.

33:58.756 --> 34:00.635
I realize that now.

34:00.660 --> 34:02.627
You were able to forgive.

34:04.422 --> 34:05.755
I was not.

34:08.105 --> 34:09.806
I won't make that mistake again.

34:16.659 --> 34:18.034
Okay.

34:21.183 --> 34:22.714
Okay.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.134
I'm sorry.

34:43.568 --> 34:45.355
I'd invite you over
to stay for the meal,

34:45.380 --> 34:48.112
but your mother and I
never got around to cooking.

34:48.137 --> 34:51.128
Ah, nah, it's okay... Uh, it's okay.

34:51.764 --> 34:55.601
I think I, uh, I know a
place where we can all eat.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.395
- Oh.
- For free.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.589
Even better.
- Yeah.

34:59.662 --> 35:00.829
Mom.

35:19.456 --> 35:22.838
Princess, wow, everything
looks fantastic. It's amazing.

35:22.863 --> 35:24.741
You doing all right? It
looks like you got a lot

35:24.766 --> 35:26.527
of cooks in the kitchen here.

35:26.552 --> 35:28.410
What, are you crazy?

35:28.435 --> 35:30.336
There's only one cook here:

35:30.361 --> 35:31.472
- me.
- All right.

35:31.497 --> 35:34.365
- I'm assisting.
- And I'm supervising.

35:34.390 --> 35:36.825
And I am tasting.

35:37.452 --> 35:39.554
Okay, well, as
long as you're cool,

35:39.579 --> 35:40.988
I'll let you guys stay at it then, okay?

35:41.013 --> 35:43.269
You're gonna love what
we're cooking here.

35:43.294 --> 35:45.329
And because it's Thanksgiving, hon,

35:45.354 --> 35:47.199
and because you're 'ohana,

35:47.529 --> 35:49.621
I'm not gonna send you a bill, okay?

35:50.510 --> 35:54.192
- Oh. Until next month.
- Ha!

35:55.205 --> 35:57.940
That's, uh, it's very
touching, thank you.

36:00.095 --> 36:01.028
What?

36:01.416 --> 36:03.550
Aw. How lucky are you?

36:03.575 --> 36:05.496
You get to hang out with
this very good boy for a week.

36:05.521 --> 36:08.788
Yeah, well, he's the only one
who doesn't drive me completely crazy.

36:11.104 --> 36:12.438
Hey, did you, um,

36:12.463 --> 36:13.663
did you end up connecting

36:13.688 --> 36:15.065
with Lena Schmidt's family in Germany?

36:15.319 --> 36:18.121
Yeah, I ended up talking to the father.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.760
He kept saying how relieved he was

36:19.785 --> 36:21.830
to finally be able to get
some closure to this thing.

36:22.256 --> 36:24.417
So am I gonna get to
meet your family today?

36:24.442 --> 36:26.409
Uh, no, no.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.128
My, uh, my ex has the kids this year.

36:29.530 --> 36:31.431
Is she your ex?

36:31.471 --> 36:33.574
Because I keep getting
conflicting reports.

36:33.599 --> 36:36.730
Huh. Worse than high
school, these people.

36:36.755 --> 36:38.746
Yeah, she's my ex,

36:38.771 --> 36:41.714
but we're, I don't know, I guess
trying to maybe work it out,

36:41.739 --> 36:43.746
- just give it another shot.
- How's that going?

36:43.771 --> 36:45.535
Uh, well, she's not here.

36:47.501 --> 36:49.212
Well, maybe I'll meet
her next Thanksgiving.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.476
- Yeah, maybe.
- Hey, everyone,

36:51.707 --> 36:53.608
these are my folks.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.561
Mr. and Mrs. Reigns, what a pleasure

36:57.586 --> 36:59.921
- it is to finally meet you both.
- Pleasure is ours.

36:59.946 --> 37:01.136
Oh, nice to meet you.
Thank you, Commander.

37:01.161 --> 37:02.639
Oh, please call me Steve, and thank you,

37:02.664 --> 37:04.496
guys, for coming by. I
know it's been a rough day.

37:04.521 --> 37:06.980
We were, we were sorry
to hear about the robbery.

37:07.005 --> 37:08.206
Appreciate that.

37:08.231 --> 37:10.392
I mean, we're just lucky
Junior was able to sort this all out.

37:10.417 --> 37:11.542
Yeah, well, Junior has

37:11.567 --> 37:13.035
a habit of doing that, sir.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.340
Junior, you want to, uh, you want

37:14.365 --> 37:16.299
- to get your folks something to drink?
- Yeah.

37:16.324 --> 37:18.481
Listen, while I got you
guys here, you should know

37:18.521 --> 37:21.675
that your son is one of the finest men

37:21.700 --> 37:23.301
I've ever had the honor of working with.

37:23.326 --> 37:26.461
- Somebody raised him right.
- Thank you.

37:26.486 --> 37:28.220
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:28.767 --> 37:30.316
Special delivery.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.933
Mrs. Reigns, here is all your stuff.

37:32.958 --> 37:35.527
Ni'ihau shell necklace included.

37:36.385 --> 37:39.691
Honey, you have no idea what
this means to me. Thank you.

37:39.716 --> 37:41.683
You're welcome.

37:41.910 --> 37:43.778
Oh, hey, guys, why don't you, uh,

37:43.803 --> 37:45.519
come on over and meet Junior's parents.

37:45.544 --> 37:47.097
- Aloha.
- Aloha. Nice to meet you.

37:47.122 --> 37:49.089
It's so good to see them here with you.

37:49.114 --> 37:50.720
I take it your talk went well?

37:50.745 --> 37:52.714
- Yeah. Yeah, it went great.
- Good.

37:53.723 --> 37:56.024
Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you.

37:56.871 --> 37:58.669
Thank you.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.347
Yeah, you covered that today.

38:00.372 --> 38:03.035
No, no, um, not just for today,

38:04.199 --> 38:05.533
for everything.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.970
I don't know if you remember,

38:08.995 --> 38:10.332
but exactly a year ago today,

38:10.357 --> 38:12.158
you gave me a pep talk

38:12.513 --> 38:14.781
before I went to my folks'
place for Thanksgiving.

38:15.253 --> 38:16.687
Since then,

38:16.712 --> 38:19.856
things between me and
my dad have, you know,

38:19.881 --> 38:21.816
been up and down,

38:21.841 --> 38:23.242
mainly down.

38:23.352 --> 38:25.457
- Mm-hmm.
- But you

38:25.482 --> 38:27.417
have been the constant in my life.

38:30.428 --> 38:31.695
Thank you.

38:32.825 --> 38:35.027
Where else would I be, Joon?

38:35.800 --> 38:37.402
Yeah.

38:37.996 --> 38:39.897
Well, I, um,

38:40.183 --> 38:42.779
I know I've been so distracted

38:42.804 --> 38:44.792
with-with my dad and everything.

38:45.807 --> 38:47.608
Y-You know, other things in my life

38:47.633 --> 38:49.133
have kind of taken a back seat.

38:50.230 --> 38:51.412
I just wanted you to know

38:51.480 --> 38:54.941
that I'm looking forward
to... changing that now.

38:57.075 --> 38:59.176
- That sounds good.
- Yeah?

38:59.201 --> 39:01.302
Uh-huh.

39:05.632 --> 39:06.799
Let me ask you a question:

39:06.824 --> 39:08.235
Is there actually gonna be any food left

39:08.260 --> 39:10.560
when it's time to sit down
to eat with these nice people?

39:10.585 --> 39:13.142
- Not if I can help it.
- Unbelievable.

39:13.167 --> 39:15.746
Hey, Renee and the kids will
be here in about ten minutes,

39:15.771 --> 39:18.458
and, uh, big brother, Chef Percy,

39:18.483 --> 39:19.750
is gonna make an appearance.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.942
- Oh, good. He bringing dessert?
- Damn right.

39:21.967 --> 39:25.165
- Kouign-amann all around.
- That's right.

39:25.190 --> 39:28.258
I think it's really nice 
that you're offering

39:28.283 --> 39:30.818
to let Danny stay here while
they're working on his place.

39:30.843 --> 39:32.929
Lou, come on. You know as well as I do,

39:32.954 --> 39:35.108
there's no mold in that man's house.

39:35.133 --> 39:37.347
- Why, Steve McGarrett.
- Huh?

39:37.372 --> 39:38.644
Whatever do you mean?

39:38.669 --> 39:41.504
First of all, he's got the
worst poker face on the planet.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.148
- Yeah.
- And, second of all, I get it.

39:43.173 --> 39:46.707
It's been a, uh, it's been
an interesting year for me,

39:47.590 --> 39:50.747
between Joe and Mom.
He's worried about me.

39:50.772 --> 39:52.706
He wants to keep an eye on me, I get it.

39:53.785 --> 39:55.652
Nice when you got a lot of friends

39:55.677 --> 39:57.078
that actually give a damn about you,

39:57.103 --> 40:00.239
- ain't it?
- Yes, it is.

40:00.264 --> 40:02.332
Speaking of poker faces,

40:02.357 --> 40:04.525
you better work on yours.
The man is a detective.

40:04.550 --> 40:06.985
He's eventually gonna know
that you know that he's lying.

40:08.717 --> 40:10.317
He doesn't have to
figure it out tonight.

40:10.675 --> 40:12.803
Hey, Steve.

40:12.828 --> 40:15.396
- What are you looking at?
- Hey, catch.

40:15.421 --> 40:18.680
What do you say, play a
few downs before we eat?

40:27.855 --> 40:29.386
Let's go.
