¶¶

00:15.016 --> 00:16.415
[Max] Hurry up!

00:16.417 --> 00:17.750
[Emily] I'm going as fast
as I can.

00:17.752 --> 00:19.618
No, you're not. You're milking
it to piss me off.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.353
You're so paranoid.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.055
[sighing]
Come on.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.158
[sparking]

00:26.160 --> 00:29.094
[engine revving]

00:29.096 --> 00:31.163
[gasping excitedly]

00:32.400 --> 00:35.067
[tires screeching]

00:37.371 --> 00:38.670
[Max]
Whoo!

00:41.175 --> 00:43.075
Slow down!

00:43.077 --> 00:44.643
Come on.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.213
Whoo! Baby!

00:48.215 --> 00:49.548
How's it handle?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.150
Steering's mushy,
front end alignment's soft,

00:51.152 --> 00:52.351
and RPMs are
running a bit hot.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.386
Oh my God. You're such a nerd.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.220
Pull over, I want to drive.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.422
[Emily]
Forget it.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.756
I stole it,
I get to drive it.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.691
[Max] Oh, come on, Em.
You always get to drive it.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.495
But this is really fun.
[laughing]

01:03.497 --> 01:06.565
¶¶

01:09.670 --> 01:11.136
-Crap.
-Just pull over.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.438
It's okay, it's okay.
We'll be fine.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.706
We're in a stolen car.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.725
It's fine, okay?
Trust me.

01:16.726 --> 01:18.743
I've talked my way out of
worse situations. Don't worry.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.316
[Emily] There's something
I didn't tell you.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.617
I don't actually have
my driver's license.

01:25.619 --> 01:26.919
What?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.220
My mom wouldn't even let me
take the test.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.522
She's scared I'll die
in a crash.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.823
Em, oh my God.
Are you kidding me right now?

01:30.825 --> 01:33.192
[tapping]

01:33.194 --> 01:34.393
I've got possible suspects.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.461
What do we do?

01:36.230 --> 01:37.162
Hang on.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.166
[engine revving]
[Cop] Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:41.168 --> 01:43.235
[siren wailing]

01:44.171 --> 01:45.237
Oh my God.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.606

[tires screeching]

01:50.711 --> 01:52.778
¶¶

02:02.690 --> 02:03.755
Holy crap.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.826
I don't see them.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.294
Em, where are we
going to go?

02:10.498 --> 02:11.563
Hang on.

02:27.481 --> 02:32.885
¶¶

02:37.424 --> 02:39.558
That was awesome.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.860
Yeah, I'm glad you liked it,

02:40.861 --> 02:42.161
because we are so not
doing that again.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.662
Yeah, right. Where have I
heard that before?

02:43.664 --> 02:46.498
I'm serious, Max!
No more joyriding.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.201
[Max] Okay. Jeez.
Bite my head off.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.603
Can't a girl just have
a little fun?

02:51.605 --> 02:54.673
¶¶

03:06.787 --> 03:08.520
I'm sorry she's
still in pieces, Dad.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.658
Parts cost money and
minimum wage sucks.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.661
Maybe you should ask
for more shifts.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.299
They can barely afford to
keep me on as it is.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.469
Maybe you should
look for a better job.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.839
I need a car for a better job,
and a driver's license.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.474
Nice try.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.444
Is there something you
want to tell me?

03:32.446 --> 03:34.613
Like how awesome of
a mom you are?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.349
It's a school night, Em.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.501
I'm sorry,
I lost track of time.

03:39.502 --> 03:41.652
Yeah, right. Well, I don't know
where you and Max go every night

03:41.655 --> 03:44.489
but a little bit more
focus on the future

03:44.491 --> 03:45.857
wouldn't hurt
either of you.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.727
Come on, don't you
have homework or something?

03:49.496 --> 03:50.729
I already did it.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.117
All right.

03:55.118 --> 03:57.469
Well, just call next time
so I'm not worrying.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.772
Deal.
Anything else?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.909
Yeah. Get your butt in bed,
it's almost 11.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.981
[sighing]

04:19.760 --> 04:22.828
¶¶

04:44.551 --> 04:46.285
Miss Wheeler,
can I have a word?

04:47.554 --> 04:48.487
What?

04:48.489 --> 04:51.356
First of all, you
can drop the attitude.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.708
Second of all,

04:52.709 --> 04:54.059
you're supposed to be
on the machine press today.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.894
You have a project
due, remember?

04:55.896 --> 04:58.063
You said I could
do engines first.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.999
[Teacher] When you're
done your other work.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.435
By the time I get back you
better be well on your way

05:03.437 --> 05:05.837
to a lawn dart, young lady.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.344
Lawn darts, really?
What a prick.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.981
He just resents the fact that
I'm a better mechanic than him.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.318
Oh, really? Are you?

05:20.721 --> 05:23.822
[Emily] You've been here
for what? Two days?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.858
So I forgive you for
not knowing that.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.827
[chuckling]
I see.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.331
So you think you're the queen of
this little ant farm, huh?

05:32.966 --> 05:36.001
[Max] What do you say we...
we prove it to you?

05:38.906 --> 05:39.971
Be my guest.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.609
You're sure you're
up for this?

05:44.611 --> 05:46.645
Bring it, new guy.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.614
[Max] Okay, neither of these
cars can start without a key.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.851
On your mark, get set...

05:54.421 --> 05:56.021
hotwire!

06:24.518 --> 06:25.650
Yeah! That's the stuff!

06:25.652 --> 06:26.718
Keep going. Keep going.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.390
Car.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.557

[students cheering]

¶¶

06:45.672 --> 06:46.905
How the hell did you do that?

06:47.508 --> 06:48.907
Powered the starter.

06:49.843 --> 06:50.842
All right.

06:52.813 --> 06:53.812
Thanks.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.481
-I'm Dylan.
-Emily.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.983
Nice ink.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.685
Oh, you like? Got that
my first week in juvie.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.621
So that's why I haven't
seen you around.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.923
Yeah.
Not my finest six months.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.560
Six. huh?
What'd you do? Rob a bank?

07:08.562 --> 07:11.696
Uh, do you really have to ask?

07:14.735 --> 07:16.701
[horn honking]

07:37.791 --> 07:40.859
¶ ¶

07:48.869 --> 07:51.470
Oh my God. Is this where
tires come to die?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.905
How did you even
find this place?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.674
An old friend of my
dad's recommended it.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.242
You can find any tire
you want.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.811
Yeah, well, the only thing we're
getting here is the evil eye.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.482
[Emily] Hi. I called about
the '70 Dodge Charger.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.518
Ah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We got that.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.054
-You sure you don't need two?
-I'm good.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.957
-All right.
-Yeah. Here you go.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.660
Yeah, cash only.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.997
Oh, I don't have enough.
Can you spot me?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.199
I'll pay you back as soon as
I get to an ATM.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.667
[Max] Oh, Em.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.503
-[Emily] Thank you.
-[Max] Mm-hmm.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.005
[Nestor] All right.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.842
God, this place is so weird.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.245
-I love it.
-[Max] Of course you do.

08:35.716 --> 08:36.882
[Man]
Stevie.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.088
You got it, you got it.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.156
[tool whirring]

08:46.293 --> 08:49.561
[grinding]

08:55.903 --> 08:59.771
[men chattering]

09:01.308 --> 09:02.574
[Max]
Em!

09:05.913 --> 09:06.978
[Nestor]
Hey.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.881
-Cool.
-Pleasure doing business.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.616
Thanks.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.884
-You got it?
-Yup.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.088
[Laughing]

09:17.090 --> 09:18.156
What?

09:18.158 --> 09:21.560
The VIN number from that car
was missing.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.294
So?

09:22.796 --> 09:24.763
So that's illegal.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.964
I think that car
was stolen

09:25.966 --> 09:27.766
and they were stripping
it for parts.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.969
Stop. You think Homeboy's
running a chop-shop in there?

09:30.971 --> 09:32.771
What do you want to do?
Go get our money back?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.873
No. It'll be twice as much
anywhere else.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.241
Let's just go.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.878
[Max] You sure you don't want
to drop off a resume?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.947
[Emily]
Funny. Ha-ha!

09:48.355 --> 09:51.623
¶¶

10:02.035 --> 10:03.702
Hey! I'm so sorry I'm late.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.254
The bus driver wouldn't
wait for me

10:05.255 --> 10:06.805
and then I had to take a cab
and there was traffic.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.775
What?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.281
"Things are tight"?

10:18.752 --> 10:19.534
Really?

10:19.535 --> 10:20.317
You're like her
best employee.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.355
My mom will be happy.

10:23.357 --> 10:25.256
She wanted me to get
a better job anyway.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.359
[scoffs] Like what?
Stocking boxes?

10:28.395 --> 10:31.129
Oh, maybe you could
scrape gum off of

10:31.131 --> 10:32.631
the bleachers at school.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.366
Okay, it's not like I have
a lot of options.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.669
I'm making a point.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.171
Working more of these
crappy jobs

10:40.173 --> 10:41.773
isn't going to
get you anywhere.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.275
You want me to go back to that
chop-shop, don't you?

10:44.277 --> 10:45.744
Yes, I do.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.049
I can't steal cars
for money.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.753
We're already stealing cars
for free.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.287
Why not get
a little more out of it

10:56.289 --> 10:58.289
other than just a good old
lady boner?

11:00.127 --> 11:01.993
Come on!

11:01.995 --> 11:03.828
What's the worst
that can happen?

11:03.830 --> 11:07.866
We're underage, which means
we're practically untouchable.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.003
If they catch us, we go to
juvie for a few months

11:12.005 --> 11:14.205
and, you know, say hi to your
boyfriend's friends.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.840
Big deal.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.742
Okay, he's not my boyfriend.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.078
Mm-hmm. Not yet.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.148
Can we do this?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.018
[sighing]

11:27.020 --> 11:28.403
[car alarm beeping]

11:28.404 --> 11:29.787
Just let me do all
the talking, okay?

11:30.891 --> 11:33.858
And please, take the stick
out of your butt.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.198
[Nestor] I don't think
I heard y'all right.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.366
I think you did.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.869
You trying to play me, girl?

11:44.871 --> 11:47.038
[Max] We're just trying to do
a business deal, that's all.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.008
You need inventory,
and let's be real,

11:50.010 --> 11:51.476
you don't really care
where it comes from.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.712
We can help with that.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.448
As long as you're willing
to cut us in.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.117
Mm-hmm.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.422
Y'all either real
stupid or cops.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.227
And I know y'all
ain't no cops.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.129
[laughing]
Right?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.198
[fake laughing]

12:13.200 --> 12:14.332
Show 'em, Em.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.972
[Nestor]
Where is she going?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.340
[Max]
Just watch, okay?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.042
[Nestor]
No, hold up.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.743
[Max] No, seriously, just wait.
Girl, do your thing.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.412
[Nestor] I ain't got no
time for all of this, man.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.247
Trust me. You're going to want
to see this, okay?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.349
[Nestor] This is my shop.
You understand that?

12:31.351 --> 12:33.384
-Just give her a second.
-So get you girl out of there.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.086
I ain't got no time.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.155
[engine revving]

12:41.027 --> 12:43.228
We should talk about money.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.797
[scoffing]

12:45.799 --> 12:49.267
We were thinking a flat fee
of $500 per car to start.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.136
What do you say?

12:55.776 --> 12:56.841
Yeah. Okay.

[Max]
Hit it, girl!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.199
Let's see how fast
this one can go!

14:00.040 --> 14:00.939
Push it!

Whoo!

14:04.611 --> 14:07.879
¶ ¶

15:24.090 --> 15:27.158
¶¶

15:58.224 --> 16:00.058
Honey! Dinner.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.426
Wash your hands, okay?

16:01.428 --> 16:03.261
-Soap.
-Be right there.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.041
How was school today?

16:19.179 --> 16:21.579
I don't know, it's school.
What do you want me to say?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.550
Well, how's the car
coming along?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.319
Spending a lot of
time in there.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.589
I think I'm going to have to
rebuild the engine.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.224
Sounds expensive.

16:35.261 --> 16:38.363
Not really.
I can get cheap parts.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.531
For a car like that?
Where?

16:40.533 --> 16:41.532
Scrapyard.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.669
-Scrapyard?
-Mm-hmm.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.005
I thought the point was
to fix it up.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.308
You don't know anything
about cars, Mom.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.145
That was your father's
area of expertise.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.783
[Gail] You know I'm not trying
to punish you, right?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.185
Could have fooled me.

17:01.187 --> 17:05.690
I just don't want you growing up
thinking that the only thing

17:05.692 --> 17:08.126
that matters in life is how fast
you go from zero to 60.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.811
Do we have to talk about
this right now?

17:09.812 --> 17:11.495
-We never talk about this.
-You never talk about it!

17:13.033 --> 17:15.333
Dad dies in a crash and suddenly
I'm not allowed to do

17:15.335 --> 17:17.301
the one thing I actually
want to with my life.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.369
It's not fair, Mom.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.204
Yeah.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.375
Maybe it's not.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.111
And maybe you're right.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.115
Look, I've been doing
some thinking.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.183
I...

17:32.185 --> 17:35.119
...I'm going to let you take
a driver's test,

17:35.121 --> 17:37.688
but I do not want you
driving too fast.

17:37.690 --> 17:42.627
And as long as you get straight
A's this semester.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.696
-Mom.
-And not just in shop class--

17:45.698 --> 17:47.165
or industrial arts.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.067
Why do grads matter so much?

17:49.069 --> 17:51.135
You and Dad went to
community college.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.071
Why do you act like if I'm not
on the honour roll,

17:53.073 --> 17:54.472
then my life is over?

17:54.474 --> 17:55.807
Because your father wanted
the best for you.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.642
He didn't want you living in
the past, in his past,

17:57.644 --> 17:59.644
obsessed with this damn car.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.246
Em! Em!

18:02.248 --> 18:03.581
I didn't--

18:12.292 --> 18:14.826
[Investor] It is an
impressive presentation.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.297
Your words.
[chuckling]

18:22.836 --> 18:26.504
You know, cars are, um,
they're my passion.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.374
Well, the passion is
certainly on the page.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.543
Well, I'm glad
you think so.

18:32.545 --> 18:39.350
Unfortunately, I just don't
see how exotic car rentals

18:39.352 --> 18:42.787
can generate enough income to
make sense on a balance sheet.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.493
I-- I hear you.
[chuckling]

18:48.495 --> 18:50.862
I do. Um...

18:50.864 --> 18:53.364
I know that the margins
are not much,

18:53.366 --> 18:55.333
but if you take a close
look at my estimates

18:55.335 --> 18:58.569
you'll see that I've put a lot
of thought into this and uh--

18:58.571 --> 19:00.171
I ran the numbers, Mr. Curnow.

19:00.173 --> 19:03.641
So did I. So did I.
I-- Many times.

19:03.643 --> 19:07.578
[Investor] I ran them twice.
And I'm... I'm sorry

19:07.580 --> 19:09.247
but with your
credit history--

19:09.249 --> 19:10.581
Hold on now. I'm working
on that credit history.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.783
That's something... I'm in
the middle of fixing.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.355
[Investor] With your current
credit history,

19:17.357 --> 19:20.324
I-- I just don't see
how I can help you.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.392
And to be frank,

19:22.462 --> 19:25.696
I don't know of any
bank that would.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.819
I appreciate you time.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.222
-Uh, your artwork, Mr. Curnow.
-Yeah.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.227
Throw that in the trash.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.566

¶¶

20:45.345 --> 20:46.644
Sure you want to do that?

20:46.646 --> 20:47.778
Do what?

20:47.780 --> 20:49.547
Walk away from me?

20:50.817 --> 20:52.650
Are we flirting?

20:52.652 --> 20:55.686
'Cause I've been away for a
while and I'm a little rusty.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.754
What do you think?

21:00.026 --> 21:02.760
I think if you're not doing
anything Saturday night,

21:03.863 --> 21:05.296
maybe we could hang out.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.569
Is that a yes?

21:11.571 --> 21:13.938
Emily was so good.
She hotwired the car.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.941
Absolutely amazing. Look at
Em, she was going so fast.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.409
I swear to God.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.846
Mr. Curnow, I'm sorry.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.948
What is so funny that you can't
watch where you're going?

21:24.884 --> 21:26.317
[Max]
I wasn't a part of it.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.454
[Max on recording]
You got this, Em! Whoo!

21:30.456 --> 21:32.957
-Go back to class.
-Okay.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.393
Sorry.

¶¶

22:17.570 --> 22:19.737
Six stolen cars
over two weeks,

22:19.739 --> 22:21.772
all within a
five mile radius.

22:23.076 --> 22:25.476
We've got a new gang of car
thieves on our hands.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.482
[Max]
You're joking, right?

22:31.484 --> 22:33.084
Is it really that bad?

22:33.086 --> 22:36.854
Em, I know the military
thing is your look

22:36.856 --> 22:39.357
but are you sure you want to
wear that on a date?

22:40.093 --> 22:41.826
It's not a
blind date, Max.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.028
He's going to go blind if
he sees you in that.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.463
[laughing]

22:45.464 --> 22:46.897
What time is he
picking you up at?

22:46.899 --> 22:49.100
Actually,
I'm picking him up.

22:49.102 --> 22:51.502
In what?
You don't drive.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.006
No, you didn't.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.842
Thought I may as well
make use of it, right?

22:59.078 --> 23:02.113
Okay, I mean, picking up a
rando ex-con's not really

23:02.115 --> 23:03.981
what I had in mind, but...

23:03.983 --> 23:06.083
he will love you in that.

23:06.085 --> 23:09.153
¶ ¶

23:11.791 --> 23:12.857
[Max] Cute, right?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.497
Pfft.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.564
[beeping]

23:29.008 --> 23:30.007
Nice ride.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.876
Going my way?

¶¶

23:41.187 --> 23:42.453
[sighing]

23:44.023 --> 23:45.990
So there's a rumour
going around school

23:45.992 --> 23:47.558
that you don't have
your license yet.

23:48.494 --> 23:49.693
I don't.

23:51.664 --> 23:55.666
¶ And how much time ¶

23:56.602 --> 23:59.670
¶¶

24:07.180 --> 24:08.779
[Emily] So, this is it.

24:09.949 --> 24:13.150
My favourite spot.
Pretty cool, huh?

24:17.223 --> 24:18.522
Yeah, it's beautiful.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.128
So, you like to drive fast,
Emily Wheeler?

24:25.498 --> 24:26.897
I like speed.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.635
Gives me freedom.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.706
-Freedom, huh?
-Yeah.

24:35.708 --> 24:39.643
From... school,

24:39.645 --> 24:41.712
my mom...

24:42.748 --> 24:43.814
life.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.754
I like to be the only one
behind the wheel.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.091
So you like to be in control?

24:54.093 --> 24:56.627
And what you have... an
obsession with cars?

24:58.564 --> 25:00.130
It's more of an addiction.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.666
Yeah, I've been
down that road.

25:05.238 --> 25:09.173
And I'm going to take a wild
guess that this isn't yours.

25:12.578 --> 25:13.644
Nope.

25:15.748 --> 25:16.981
Then whose?

25:17.984 --> 25:19.850
I didn't get their name.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.553
Wow.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.057
I thought you'd be impressed.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.376
[chuckling]

25:29.377 --> 25:31.694
Look, you get that I was in
juvie for auto theft, right?

25:33.099 --> 25:36.267
It's okay, I'll have you home
before you turn into a pumpkin.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.135
Emily, it's not a joke.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.771
All right, screwing around in
shop class is one thing,

25:40.773 --> 25:43.274
but actually boosting cars,
that almost ruined my life.

25:43.276 --> 25:45.609
Okay. I didn't know you
felt that way.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.012
I'm sorry.

25:51.951 --> 25:55.586
Please just tell me this
was a one-time thing.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.221
It was.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.224
It was just a one-time thing.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.060
I promise.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.568
Hey. 'Kay,
you were lying, right?

26:10.570 --> 26:11.869
About not ripping
rides anymore?

26:11.871 --> 26:13.203
-Yeah.
-Obviously.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.105
Okay, good, because Nestor
just texted me like,

26:15.107 --> 26:16.807
a list of stuff he needed
yesterday.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.309
So, let's hit it
after school, okay?

26:18.311 --> 26:19.577
[Emily]
Okay.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.213
¶¶

26:30.122 --> 26:31.355
[Max]
No, there's no way.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.290
You always get to drive.
'm driving my own car.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.359
-[Emily] Fine.
-[Max] All right, let's go.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.065
[engine revving]

27:02.955 --> 27:04.021
[Emily]
Stop the car.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.303
That's the one.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.290
Wait here.

27:22.291 --> 27:23.841
[Max] Okay.
Hurry it up.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.410
Hm.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.280
[sighing]

27:48.668 --> 27:49.667
Mr. Curnow?

27:50.936 --> 27:51.935
Hello, Max.

27:53.205 --> 27:56.040
Uh. What are you
doing here?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.376
I would ask you
the same question

27:59.378 --> 28:00.978
but I think I know
the answer.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.258
You going for a joyride?

28:14.260 --> 28:16.193
It's my cousin's car.
He left his keys inside.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.728
I was just helping him.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.329
Save your breath, Miss Wheeler.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.699
You can either talk to the
police or you can talk to me

28:21.701 --> 28:23.967
and I think you'll be
a lot more interested

28:23.969 --> 28:25.035
in what I have to say.

28:26.272 --> 28:29.339
¶¶

28:31.744 --> 28:33.343
Max, you're going to
take me to my car

28:33.345 --> 28:35.112
and then you two
are going to follow me.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.116
¶¶

29:30.202 --> 29:32.035
Didn't know you were
a farmer.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.139
Nobody farms anymore.

29:35.141 --> 29:38.809
Been trying to sell this dump
since my Pop kicked the bucket.

29:38.811 --> 29:41.078
So what are we
doing here?

29:43.115 --> 29:46.450
Coming to a mutually beneficial
arrangement, I hope.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.185
We already have
one of those.

29:48.187 --> 29:49.987
Let me guess,

29:49.989 --> 29:53.290
you two boost cars that are
easy to steal, yeah?

29:54.827 --> 29:57.795
Your silent partner
pays you a pittance

29:57.797 --> 29:59.163
while turning around
and making a mint

29:59.165 --> 30:01.832
stripping them for parts.
How'd I do?

30:04.203 --> 30:06.804
Ladies, that is
a sucker's game.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.239
There are bigger fish
out there; much bigger.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.975
We're not interested.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.477
[Mr. Curnow]
Maybe I wasn't clear.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.113
Either come and work
for me,

30:16.115 --> 30:17.948
or spend the rest
of your teen years

30:17.950 --> 30:20.417
making licence plates
in county lock-up.

30:21.353 --> 30:22.920
Maybe we should
hear him out, Em.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.121
[Mr. Curnow] Listen
to your friend.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.956
I already know
what he's gonna say.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.825
He wants us to go
after luxury models.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.428
That is exactly
what I'm going to say.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.898
But those cars all have
that smart-key system thing.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.433
I thought they were, like,
impossible to steal.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.101
Not impossible. Just risky.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.337
[Mr. Curnow] With great
risk comes great reward.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.006
You're talking about
a relay station attack?

30:43.008 --> 30:44.575
Yes. Yes, I am.

30:44.577 --> 30:46.310
[Max] What's a relay
station attack?

30:46.312 --> 30:48.312
[Mr. Curnow] That is
a good question.

30:48.314 --> 30:51.181
Smart keys use RFID.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.182
[car horn honking]

30:52.184 --> 30:54.251
Radio frequency
identification.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.153
It is the same tech
that allows you

30:56.155 --> 30:59.022
to buy anything with
the tap of a credit card.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.958
Now, the trick is

31:00.960 --> 31:04.261
making the car think
that you are the owner.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.596
So, how do we do that?

31:05.598 --> 31:06.864
You need two people.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.266
[Mr. Curnow] Miss Wheeler
is correct.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.368
Allow me to demonstrate.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.170
Let's say that you
were the owner.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.539
Miss Wheeler,
you will be our thief.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.275
Take this. Come with me.
Stand here.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.947
Now, in order to
trick the car

31:23.949 --> 31:25.382
into thinking
that Miss Wheeler

31:25.384 --> 31:27.284
has a legitimate key,

31:27.286 --> 31:29.419
I have to get
close enough to you

31:29.421 --> 31:32.022
to ping your fob
with this.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.959
The closer,
the better.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.162
[device beeping]

31:39.164 --> 31:40.097
Disco.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.432
Once I've captured
the car's unique signal,

31:42.434 --> 31:44.134
I then transmit it
to my accomplice.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.369
Press the button.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.037
Go ahead.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.272
[lock clicking open]

31:48.274 --> 31:49.640
There it is.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.909
Allowing her access to
the vehicle, yeah?

31:51.911 --> 31:53.010
Hop in.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.013
[sighing]

31:56.015 --> 32:00.150
Now, since most new cars
have keyless ignition

32:00.152 --> 32:01.885
as well as keyless entry,

32:01.886 --> 32:03.619
once you're past the security
system, starting the engine

32:03.622 --> 32:05.355
is simply a matter of
pushing a button.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.423
Go ahead.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.695
[engine starting]

32:14.500 --> 32:16.633
[chuckling]
Yeah.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.635
So, what do you say,
Miss Wheeler?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.638
Are you ready to play
in the big leagues?

32:23.442 --> 32:26.510
¶¶

32:53.405 --> 32:55.439
-That's it.
-She's a beaut.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.977
[alarm beeping]

33:05.184 --> 33:06.583
[exhaling sharply]
Okay.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.086
Who's going to do this?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.254
Rock, paper,
scissors?

33:11.256 --> 33:13.190
[chuckling]
Okay.

33:17.062 --> 33:20.097
All right.
Here you go.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.031
Thank you.

33:21.033 --> 33:24.167
[exhaling sharply]
I can do this.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.402
Okay, okay.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.851
[Maitre d'] Very well.
How are you?

33:40.852 --> 33:42.185
-[Man] Good, thank you.
-Reservation this evening?

33:42.187 --> 33:43.253
[Man] Yeah. For two.

33:43.254 --> 33:44.320
-Under what name?
-Under Williams.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.790
[exhaling sharply]

33:46.791 --> 33:48.324
[Maitre d'] Mina will show you
to your table.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.427
[switch clicking]

33:50.429 --> 33:51.728
[sighing]

33:55.100 --> 33:56.433
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.601
'Evening, folks.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.603
[Man] Reservations
for McDonald, please.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.546
Come on. Come on, Max.

34:17.790 --> 34:20.257
[Max]
Come on. Please work.

34:26.832 --> 34:28.331
[gasping]

34:28.333 --> 34:29.733
How can I help you,
ma'am?

34:31.336 --> 34:32.402
Uh--

34:36.542 --> 34:38.608
[Man] Hey, excuse me.
Which way is--

34:41.513 --> 34:42.546
Just a second.

34:43.515 --> 34:44.548
Come on.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.483
Come on, come on, come on.

34:59.531 --> 35:02.132
I'm sorry. My lunch date
actually just cancelled.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.570
Yes!

35:13.245 --> 35:14.578
[giggling breathlessly]

35:16.515 --> 35:19.249
[engine starting]

35:19.251 --> 35:20.417
[Emily] It worked!

35:38.904 --> 35:40.804
Now, this?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.839
This is a car.
[laughing]

35:42.841 --> 35:44.141
[Emily]
Glad you're happy.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.208
Where's our money?

35:45.210 --> 35:48.512
As soon as I land a buyer,
you will get your cut.

35:48.514 --> 35:49.779
That wasn't the deal.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.314
Yeah. What are you
trying to pull?

35:51.850 --> 35:52.916
Don't do that.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.721
I'm not trying
to pull anything.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.556
Do you think that
I'd be doing this

35:59.558 --> 36:01.658
if I had that kind of
cash lying around?

36:03.629 --> 36:05.695
You get paid
when I get paid.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.270
Oh, and ladies?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.605
I see a lot of empty
space here, right?

36:15.607 --> 36:19.643
A successful business
needs inventory, right?

36:19.645 --> 36:22.746
Now is not the time
to rest on our laurels.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.550
Now, help me cover this up.

36:26.552 --> 36:30.620
That right there.
Get these, uh, in good shape.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.694
¶¶

37:10.395 --> 37:11.795
[device beeping]

37:11.797 --> 37:14.798
¶¶

37:19.838 --> 37:21.571
[tires squealing]

37:37.656 --> 37:40.724
¶¶

39:37.976 --> 39:38.975
What?

39:39.544 --> 39:40.944
Something came for you.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.050
Parts for
your dad's car?

39:47.052 --> 39:48.051
Yeah.

39:48.053 --> 39:53.390
Express delivery from Canada.
That can't have been cheap.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.557
Couldn't find
it anywhere else.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.727
You can afford that on what
they pay you at the mall?

39:58.663 --> 40:00.730
-I asked for a raise.
-Really?

40:01.500 --> 40:04.567
'Cause you said they could
barely afford to keep you on.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.436
I'm doing
some extra work

40:06.438 --> 40:09.072
for Mr. Curnow,
my industrial arts teacher.

40:10.175 --> 40:13.543
-What kind of extra work?
-Uh, farming.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.978
-Farming?
-Yep.

40:16.148 --> 40:17.414
He has a farm.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.916
Out on Gibson Road.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.118
I mean, it hasn't been used
in, like, ever.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.587
So, me and some other kids
are clearing out some junk

40:24.589 --> 40:26.523
and cleaning it up.
There's an old racer, too,

40:26.525 --> 40:28.057
so I've been helping him
with that.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.060
And, uh, yeah. He's giving
me extra credit.

40:33.498 --> 40:34.114
Hmm.

40:34.115 --> 40:34.731
So, he's giving you
extra credit

40:34.733 --> 40:37.901
and enough money
to buy rare parts

40:37.903 --> 40:40.703
for a vintage
Dodge Charger?

40:40.705 --> 40:43.807
Okay, Mom. Look. I should
have told you earlier.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.875
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.214
Listen. Can I go? I have a
trig test to study for.

40:52.684 --> 40:53.850
Yeah.

40:58.523 --> 40:59.889
Oh, God.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.897
[door creaking open]

41:07.899 --> 41:10.200
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:10.202 --> 41:11.835
How you doing?
Door was open.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.470
Thought I'd
drop by. Hope you don't mind.

41:13.472 --> 41:14.871
No. Of course not.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.208
So, this is your baby, huh?

41:18.210 --> 41:21.010
-Yep. That's her.
-[whistling]

41:21.012 --> 41:22.812
And you're gonna
restore her all by yourself?

41:22.814 --> 41:25.949
Well, my dad always said
we'd do it together.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.550
He's gone, so...

41:28.787 --> 41:30.887
Yeah. Mine wasn't
around much, either.

41:30.889 --> 41:33.556
But hey, at least you had him in
your life as long as you did.

41:33.558 --> 41:37.594
-Yeah, I guess.
-Uh, what's the package?

41:39.030 --> 41:40.096
Oh. Parts.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.532
Cool.

41:42.534 --> 41:44.234
You want help
installing them?

41:44.236 --> 41:46.736
Um, you know, you really
don't have to do that.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.137
Well, I want to.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.708
I appreciate the offer, but--

41:51.710 --> 41:56.779
Uh, look. I thought things
were going well with us.

41:56.781 --> 41:57.780
They are.

41:59.084 --> 42:00.917
All right, well, I know
my way around an engine,

42:00.919 --> 42:02.151
so what's the problem?

42:02.721 --> 42:05.955
It's just something
I have to do myself.

42:07.792 --> 42:09.592
Does that make sense?

42:09.594 --> 42:11.160
Yeah.

42:11.162 --> 42:12.729
Totally.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.931
Um, well, how about
I take you out tonight?

42:14.933 --> 42:16.833
I told my mom
I have to study.

42:16.835 --> 42:18.268
Okay. After that?

42:18.270 --> 42:19.869
It's a school night.
I'm beat.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.070
Okay.
The weekend, then?

42:21.072 --> 42:22.772
I promise I won't
help you with the car.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.040
Well, me and Max
have a thing.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.675
A thing? What thing?

42:25.677 --> 42:27.710
A girl thing.

42:27.712 --> 42:30.280
Yeah. You guys are really
attached at the hip, huh?

42:30.282 --> 42:32.949
I know, and I'm sorry.

42:32.951 --> 42:35.318
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

42:39.157 --> 42:42.759
Okay. Well,
I will see you later, then.

42:42.761 --> 42:43.960
I'll call you.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.328
[Dylan] Okay.

42:47.032 --> 42:48.898
[sighing]

42:59.778 --> 43:00.843
[phone buzzing]

43:00.845 --> 43:02.278
[Teacher]
That he, uh, embraced.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.914
And every single line
that he wrote--

43:04.916 --> 43:07.050
[buzzing continues]

43:07.052 --> 43:10.720
Is to know the AABBAA...

43:11.656 --> 43:13.723
[teacher speaking indistinctly]

43:15.727 --> 43:17.860
[Nestor] Where the hell
are you two?

43:17.862 --> 43:21.331
I been hearing rumours,
and not the good kind.

43:21.333 --> 43:23.099
Hit me back
when you get this.

43:24.336 --> 43:25.602
[beeping phone off]

43:26.605 --> 43:28.004
[Woman]
Mr. Baines?

43:30.008 --> 43:32.342
Detective Torres,
auto theft division.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.378
Can I have a moment
of your time?

43:38.149 --> 43:41.117
[chattering indistinctly]

43:41.119 --> 43:42.885
All right.
Catch you guys later.

43:44.956 --> 43:47.023
[students chattering
indistinctly]

43:56.334 --> 43:59.135
Dylan? Nice to
see you again.

43:59.137 --> 44:01.671
Detective, what--
what are you doing here?

44:01.673 --> 44:04.307
I just wanted a moment
of your time.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.275
Can we chat?

44:06.277 --> 44:08.344
Uh, sure.

44:08.346 --> 44:09.812
Yeah.

44:19.090 --> 44:21.658
Principal Moss tells me
you've been adjusting well.

44:21.660 --> 44:22.992
That's good to hear.

44:22.994 --> 44:25.795
Hey. No one is happier
to be out than me.

44:25.797 --> 44:26.863
I believe it.

44:28.967 --> 44:31.668
So, why are we having
this conversation?

44:32.270 --> 44:34.220
I've got a problem.

44:34.221 --> 44:36.171
I thought you might be able
to shed some light on it.

44:38.943 --> 44:40.343
What kind of problem?

44:40.344 --> 44:41.744
Someone is boosting
luxury cars,

44:41.746 --> 44:42.979
the kind with
rich and powerful owners

44:42.981 --> 44:44.247
who have pull
down at city hall.

44:44.249 --> 44:45.348
You think
I'm involved?

44:45.350 --> 44:48.151
Maybe. Not directly.

44:48.153 --> 44:50.119
We have witnesses who put
the same teenage girl

44:50.121 --> 44:52.155
at three of the scenes.

44:52.157 --> 44:54.057
I believe she has
at least one accomplice,

44:54.059 --> 44:56.759
also female,
probably the same age.

44:56.761 --> 44:58.795
I don't know anything
about that.

44:58.797 --> 45:01.097
Like I said, I really
don't want to go back in.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.032
I bet you don't.

45:03.034 --> 45:06.002
Because the next time
I catch you

45:06.004 --> 45:07.970
in the same zip code
as a stolen car,

45:07.972 --> 45:10.373
it won't be pretend prison.
It'll be the real thing.

45:12.811 --> 45:15.278
I don't know who stole
those cars, detective.

45:16.214 --> 45:17.447
I swear to God.

45:18.817 --> 45:21.217
Well, then,
I guess we're done.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.053
If you hear anything,

45:24.055 --> 45:25.988
don't hesitate
to give me a call.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.929
[sighing]

45:35.033 --> 45:37.100
[keys clacking]

45:38.770 --> 45:39.769
Emily?

45:40.839 --> 45:43.139
Emily?
Hey.

45:43.141 --> 45:44.741
Look.
I need to talk to you.

45:52.884 --> 45:54.217
So, that car the other day,

45:54.219 --> 45:56.219
that wasn't a one-time
thing, was it?

45:56.221 --> 45:58.254
-Look. Dylan--
-Don't try and deny it.

45:58.256 --> 46:00.790
The cops just finished
grilling me.

46:00.792 --> 46:02.992
They are on to you, Em.
You and Max.

46:04.829 --> 46:06.663
-What did you tell them?
-Nothing.

46:06.664 --> 46:08.498
But they have witnesses. What if
they put you in a line-up?

46:08.500 --> 46:10.333
I mean, we're just guesses.

46:10.335 --> 46:11.768
You think that
that matters?

46:12.871 --> 46:14.871
Man, you're so naive.

46:14.873 --> 46:16.539
Okay, look.
It's not that simple.

46:16.541 --> 46:18.241
There's someone else involved.

46:18.243 --> 46:21.010
-Who?
-Curnow.

46:21.012 --> 46:23.513
Industrial arts teacher Curnow?

46:23.515 --> 46:25.548
He found out what we're doing.
I don't know how,

46:25.550 --> 46:27.784
and he's blackmailing us
to steal for him.

46:27.786 --> 46:31.120
You got to get out now,
before it ends badly.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.188
Trust me.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.124
I have to talk to Max.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.565
Hmm.

46:47.472 --> 46:49.505
[beeping]

46:55.313 --> 46:56.379
Hmm.

46:57.816 --> 46:59.215
[knocking]

47:02.120 --> 47:03.570
Mr. Curnow?

47:03.571 --> 47:05.021
-That's right.
-Hi. I'm Gail Wheeler.

47:05.023 --> 47:06.255
I'm Emily's mom.

47:08.026 --> 47:09.325
I'm sorry to just pop
by like this.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.561
Your secretary said
you might be in.

47:11.563 --> 47:12.995
Come on in.

47:16.501 --> 47:18.868
What can I do for you,
Miss Wheeler?

47:18.870 --> 47:22.171
Um, this might seem like
an odd question,

47:22.173 --> 47:25.575
but do you own a farm
out on Gibson Road?

47:27.045 --> 47:29.011
I have a few acres.
Why do you ask?

47:31.115 --> 47:33.149
My daughter said that she
was working for you,

47:33.151 --> 47:35.852
I just wanted to make sure
she wasn't full of it.

47:37.088 --> 47:38.888
Well, she's not exactly
tilling the fields,

47:38.890 --> 47:40.323
if that's
what she told you.

47:40.325 --> 47:42.425
[chuckling]

47:42.426 --> 47:44.526
Well, she mentioned she
was working on an old car.

47:44.529 --> 47:48.531
That's right.
I'm a, uh, collector.

47:48.533 --> 47:51.434
Um, just more of a hobby
than anything else.

47:51.436 --> 47:54.237
I don't expect to be making
any... any money from it.

47:55.273 --> 47:56.339
I see.

47:57.108 --> 48:00.509
Uh, well,
speaking of money,

48:00.511 --> 48:02.578
can I ask how much
you're paying her?

48:02.580 --> 48:05.114
What did she tell you
I was paying her?

48:05.116 --> 48:09.051
Well, enough to buy expensive
car parts, apparently.

48:10.255 --> 48:12.188
I'm sure you're aware of
her obsession with cars?

48:12.190 --> 48:14.123
Oh, I am well aware.

48:14.125 --> 48:15.591
Your daughter
is quite the mechanic.

48:15.593 --> 48:16.893
[Gail] Mm-hmm.

48:16.895 --> 48:18.361
Truth be told,
she's my best student.

48:18.363 --> 48:21.430
I'm only here temporarily until
they find someone permanent,

48:21.432 --> 48:23.032
but she's my favourite.

48:23.034 --> 48:24.100
Oh, that's good to hear.

48:24.102 --> 48:25.501
It just doesn't answer
my question.

48:25.503 --> 48:27.003
I'm sorry that
your daughter

48:27.005 --> 48:28.537
is having trouble
managing her money.

48:28.539 --> 48:31.641
I'm just not quite sure
what it has to do with me.

48:33.011 --> 48:35.511
Well, I guess my concern is that

48:35.513 --> 48:37.413
she's spending a lot
of time out there,

48:38.182 --> 48:40.483
and she might be
neglecting her schoolwork.

48:40.485 --> 48:43.019
Oh, I would never let this
interfere with her education,

48:44.622 --> 48:45.972
Miss Wheeler.

48:45.973 --> 48:47.323
In fact, she's earning
extra credits.

48:48.426 --> 48:49.425
I see.

48:50.128 --> 48:51.928
I'm sorry. I've got to run.

48:51.930 --> 48:53.362
I've got a conference call
in a few minutes.

48:53.364 --> 48:54.597
Can I walk you out?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.500
No, it's okay. I'm good.

48:57.502 --> 48:59.602
Oh, I insist.
Just to the door.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.305
[Gail] Okay.

49:02.307 --> 49:04.140
I appreciate you coming by
and talking to me.

49:04.142 --> 49:06.609
Well, it's nice
to finally meet you.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.211
Absolutely, absolutely.
Enjoy the rest of your day.

49:09.213 --> 49:11.280
-Okay?
-And you as well.

49:28.266 --> 49:31.334
¶¶

49:45.249 --> 49:46.182
No.

49:46.250 --> 49:47.183
No?

49:47.318 --> 49:48.768
If they were onto us,

49:48.769 --> 49:50.219
they would've brought us in for
questioning already.

49:50.221 --> 49:52.054
Well, you really want to
take that chance?

49:52.690 --> 49:55.491
Look, Max,
I know this detective.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.059
She's a hard-ass
with half the judges

49:57.061 --> 49:58.327
in the state
on her speed-dial.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.162
You guys will be tried
as adults.

50:00.164 --> 50:03.299
This isn't just about a few
months in juvie anymore, Max.

50:03.301 --> 50:05.267
We need to talk to Curnow.
Maybe he can do something.

50:05.269 --> 50:08.537
-Like what, Em?
-I don't know.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.340
Damn it.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.242
If we had just stuck to
the original plan--

50:13.244 --> 50:15.077
low-profile cars,
selling them for parts--

50:15.079 --> 50:17.146
we wouldn't be
in this stupid mess.

50:17.148 --> 50:19.548
Look. We just need to tell
him that we're out.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.220
Just there.

50:25.690 --> 50:26.756
Thank you.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.427
You two are
hard to track down.

50:34.465 --> 50:36.599
-Who's this?
-The original plan.

50:37.702 --> 50:40.403
-I don't know you.
-It's okay. He's cool.

50:40.405 --> 50:42.171
It's not okay.
Get lost.

50:52.316 --> 50:53.716
You tell him about me?

50:54.485 --> 50:55.184
No.

50:56.354 --> 50:58.554
And what about this mystery man
that you been

50:58.556 --> 51:00.656
boosting cars for you?
You tell him?

51:02.493 --> 51:04.126
We don't know what
you're talking about.

51:04.128 --> 51:05.194
Shut up.

51:06.297 --> 51:08.230
Now, I thought
you were smart.

51:09.367 --> 51:11.400
I guess I was wrong.

51:13.337 --> 51:16.305
Hmm. You getting
way too ambitious.

51:17.308 --> 51:19.575
Bringing heat down
on my business.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.811
I can't have that.

51:23.181 --> 51:24.613
Okay. We didn't
know, so--

51:24.615 --> 51:26.215
What did I just say?

51:30.855 --> 51:34.757
Here's the deal.
Now, listen carefully.

51:36.127 --> 51:37.359
It's a one-time offer.

51:39.163 --> 51:40.396
Stop what you're doing.

51:41.432 --> 51:44.100
Go back to your sock hops
and sleepovers.

51:46.571 --> 51:48.437
And if I hear that
you've been dipping

51:48.439 --> 51:51.440
your pretty little toes
back in the pool,

51:53.244 --> 51:54.643
I'm going to
chop them off.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.480
You understand?

52:03.888 --> 52:05.488
Oh, my God. Damn it, Em,

52:05.490 --> 52:08.157
we really need to
talk to Curnow now.

52:08.159 --> 52:09.558
Okay. Let's go.

52:14.532 --> 52:17.600
¶ ¶

52:35.853 --> 52:37.920
[birds chirping]

52:43.694 --> 52:45.761
[knocking on window]

53:15.193 --> 53:16.926
[sighing]
Oh, Em.

53:18.196 --> 53:20.262
What have you
gotten yourself into?

53:23.935 --> 53:25.201
Miss Wheeler.

53:28.372 --> 53:30.306
If you're looking for
Emily, she's, uh--

53:30.308 --> 53:31.874
she's not here.

53:31.876 --> 53:34.210
Yeah. She, um--
She didn't come home.

53:34.212 --> 53:37.880
I just... figured
she was with you.

53:41.586 --> 53:42.185
I got it.

53:42.186 --> 53:42.785
You know,
folks around this way

53:42.787 --> 53:43.953
don't take kindly
to people

53:43.955 --> 53:45.988
traipsing around
their property uninvited.

53:45.990 --> 53:47.289
I'm sorry.

53:47.291 --> 53:49.225
Or peeking
where they shouldn't.

53:49.227 --> 53:51.460
No. I didn't
really see anything.

53:53.231 --> 53:54.697
Not even my collection?

53:54.699 --> 53:56.765
-Yeah. Well...
-[chuckling]

53:56.767 --> 53:58.968
Must be expensive.

53:58.970 --> 54:00.736
[Mr. Curnow] Not if you
know the right people.

54:03.374 --> 54:05.441
Like your daughter,
for instance.

54:06.844 --> 54:11.680
So, what is she, your...
on-call mechanic?

54:13.684 --> 54:16.518
-More of a partner in crime.
-Mm-hmm.

54:16.520 --> 54:18.621
I'm just going
to see myself out.

54:18.623 --> 54:21.390
-Get-- Oh!
-Don't move. Relax.

54:21.392 --> 54:23.525
We're just going to have a
conversation inside, okay?

54:24.729 --> 54:25.794
Okay.

54:26.797 --> 54:29.865
¶¶

54:47.551 --> 54:48.684
[Max] Anything?

54:48.686 --> 54:49.785
Curnow's still not answering.

54:49.787 --> 54:50.853
Seriously?

54:50.855 --> 54:52.688
We've got to
figure this out, Em.

54:52.690 --> 54:54.857
I know. I'll just keep trying.
I'll call you later, okay?

54:54.859 --> 54:55.924
[Max] Okay.

55:12.543 --> 55:15.411
[Curnow]
I love your taste in cars.

55:16.347 --> 55:18.914
Dukes of Hazzard
changed my life.

55:24.021 --> 55:25.721
What are you doing here?

55:25.723 --> 55:27.456
You are not the only
one who knows

55:27.458 --> 55:29.825
how to bypass
a security system.

55:32.563 --> 55:33.796
I've been trying
to call you.

55:34.632 --> 55:36.598
I know.
I got your messages.

55:38.636 --> 55:41.103
So, you know
about the police?

55:41.105 --> 55:42.705
When you steal
this many luxury cars,

55:42.707 --> 55:44.573
you're bound to
attract attention.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.076
And you're okay
with that?

55:48.746 --> 55:50.946
Well, by tonight,
my lot will be empty

55:50.948 --> 55:55.351
and we will both have an extra
zero in our bank accounts.

55:55.353 --> 55:57.953
There's just one more thing
I need you to do,

55:57.955 --> 56:00.122
and then we can go on
our separate ways.

56:00.124 --> 56:01.523
I can't.

56:02.593 --> 56:04.093
Our silent partner found out
what we're doing

56:04.095 --> 56:05.994
and he's not letting us
work for you anymore.

56:05.996 --> 56:07.896
Well, that's not
my problem.

56:07.898 --> 56:10.699
You don't understand.
This guy is serious.

56:13.003 --> 56:15.404
What makes you think
that I am not?

56:17.408 --> 56:18.407
He'll kill you.

56:19.110 --> 56:20.709
He'll have to
find me first.

56:21.645 --> 56:23.679
-I'll tell him where you are.
-Oh, no. No, you won't.

56:23.681 --> 56:25.914
Not if you want to see
your mother alive again.

56:27.718 --> 56:29.385
What are you talking about?

56:29.387 --> 56:31.553
I caught her sniffing
around my home.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.523
What the hell are you
thinking, telling her

56:34.525 --> 56:36.425
that you were working
for me?

56:36.427 --> 56:38.394
I had to tell her something.
She was getting suspicious.

56:38.396 --> 56:39.995
Well, congratulations.

56:39.997 --> 56:41.930
You just put her life
in danger.

56:42.967 --> 56:45.000
-What is this?
-That is your last job.

56:45.002 --> 56:48.137
Uh, bring me that car by
tomorrow night, midnight,

56:48.139 --> 56:49.938
and you will see
your mother again.

56:50.875 --> 56:53.409
And what makes you think I'm not
just going to call the police?

56:53.411 --> 56:55.677
You mean besides the fact
that she will die

56:55.679 --> 56:58.046
and you'll go to jail?

56:59.517 --> 57:01.016
Nothing. Nothing at all.

57:16.033 --> 57:17.032
That's the Hummer.

57:17.034 --> 57:19.902
What's the big deal?
We can totally steal that.

57:19.904 --> 57:21.804
No, no, no. The big deal
is whose car it is.

57:21.806 --> 57:23.739
That's Staxx's,
and he loves that car.

57:23.741 --> 57:24.807
Who's Staxx?

57:24.809 --> 57:26.542
He's the owner of
Live nightclub,

57:26.544 --> 57:29.077
and no one messes with
Staxx. He's connected.

57:29.079 --> 57:31.847
Okay. How bad can he be?
His name has two "x's" in it.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.782
No, Max. You're
not listening, okay?

57:33.784 --> 57:35.083
No one steals
from a guy like that

57:35.085 --> 57:36.485
unless it's
some sort of vendetta.

57:36.487 --> 57:39.154
It's suicide, okay?
You have to walk away.

57:39.156 --> 57:41.457
-I don't have a choice.
-We could call the police.

57:43.227 --> 57:46.195
She's my mom. I'll do
it myself if I have to.

57:46.197 --> 57:48.730
Em, you're my best friend. I'm
not just going to abandon you.

57:48.732 --> 57:50.566
But it's my fault you're even
involved in the first place.

57:50.568 --> 57:52.084
[Max] Are you kidding me?

57:52.085 --> 57:53.601
I basically had to drag you
back to that chop shop.

57:53.604 --> 57:54.870
Yeah, but if I hadn't
been so good at--

57:54.872 --> 57:56.488
All right, all right.
I get it.

57:56.489 --> 57:58.105
You're both amazing
and you're both to blame.

57:58.108 --> 58:00.075
Let's start working
on a plan.

58:00.077 --> 58:02.110
[Max] Okay.
How do we find him?

58:02.112 --> 58:03.712
[Dylan] Easy.
His nightclub.

58:04.615 --> 58:06.715
Dylan, you can't be
a part of this.

58:06.717 --> 58:08.250
What? Look.

58:08.252 --> 58:10.819
Em, I know I'm just
the idiot that got caught

58:10.821 --> 58:12.855
and went to juvie,
but I'm your boyfriend.

58:12.857 --> 58:14.723
-I'm going to help you.
-It's not that.

58:14.725 --> 58:15.991
The police
could be following you,

58:15.993 --> 58:18.093
and we can't afford to
tip them off.

58:18.095 --> 58:19.695
If you really want to help,

58:19.697 --> 58:21.864
you'll stay as far away
from me as you can.

58:21.866 --> 58:25.601
So, basically,
I get the hardest job.

58:26.704 --> 58:27.769
You'll manage.

58:28.939 --> 58:31.039
All right,
but I'm backup, okay?

58:31.041 --> 58:32.941
If something happens,
you call me.

58:32.943 --> 58:34.209
I will.

58:36.947 --> 58:38.514
You be careful.

58:39.250 --> 58:40.516
[Emily] I will.

58:44.722 --> 58:46.788
[sighing]

58:54.131 --> 58:55.697
[Male Detective] Just heard back
from the surveillance team.

58:55.699 --> 58:58.634
Our boy's got company.
Two females. High school age.

58:58.636 --> 58:59.635
Where?

58:59.637 --> 59:03.238
6861 Mervis. The house
is owned by a Gail Wheeler.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.774
Has one daughter. Emily, 17.

59:05.776 --> 59:07.009
It's her class photo.

59:07.978 --> 59:09.978
It gets better.
Her father was Jason Wheeler.

59:09.980 --> 59:11.680
Won a couple of mechanics' jobs.

59:11.682 --> 59:13.949
Died in a street race
six years ago.

59:13.951 --> 59:15.317
That's our girl.

59:15.319 --> 59:17.586
Tell the team to sit on all
three until I get there.

59:17.588 --> 59:18.654
Got it.

59:20.958 --> 59:22.257
I'll handle this one.

59:22.259 --> 59:23.725
What happened to
rock, paper, scissors?

59:23.727 --> 59:25.127
She's my mom.
I'll take the risks.

59:26.330 --> 59:27.763
[Max] Fine with me.

59:56.293 --> 59:58.193
[Torres] What do you mean
we lost the girls?

59:58.194 --> 1:00:00.094
What part of "sit on all three"
did you not understand?

1:00:00.097 --> 1:00:01.763
[Male detective]
We took separate cars,

1:00:01.765 --> 1:00:02.998
we couldn't follow both of them.

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:04.950
Put out a BOLO.

1:00:04.951 --> 1:00:06.901
I want those two in an interview
room by the end of the night.

1:00:06.904 --> 1:00:08.303
[Male detective]
What about Felt?

1:00:09.139 --> 1:00:10.739
Let's take him down.

[siren sounding]

1:00:31.962 --> 1:00:33.395
Damn it.

1:00:38.302 --> 1:00:40.068
We need to map out
multiple escape routes

1:00:40.070 --> 1:00:41.904
and we need to buy a new look.

1:00:41.905 --> 1:00:43.739
Em, we're fine. We just plan it
out like we always do, okay?

1:00:43.741 --> 1:00:44.907
Don't worry.

1:00:44.908 --> 1:00:46.074
[phone ringing]
Hey.

1:00:46.075 --> 1:00:47.241
[Dylan ]We must have been
under surveillance.

1:00:47.244 --> 1:00:48.710
Which means they
know who you are.

1:00:48.712 --> 1:00:50.245
-[Max] Who is it?
-[Emily] It's Dylan.

1:00:50.247 --> 1:00:51.647
Put it on speakerphone.

1:00:52.282 --> 1:00:54.416
[Emily] Hey, Dylan,
what's going on?

1:00:54.418 --> 1:00:56.785
-Give me this.
-[sighing]

1:00:56.787 --> 1:00:58.186
Is this Emily Wheeler?

1:00:58.822 --> 1:01:00.889
This is Detective Torres.

1:01:03.260 --> 1:01:05.961
Your little joyride
is over, Emily.

1:01:07.031 --> 1:01:08.196
You and your friend

1:01:08.198 --> 1:01:09.865
need to turn yourselves
in right now

1:01:09.867 --> 1:01:11.733
-before someone gets hurt.
-Oh, my God.

1:01:13.837 --> 1:01:15.170
I know you're listening.

1:01:16.707 --> 1:01:17.773
You're a smart girl.

1:01:18.809 --> 1:01:20.375
Don't end up like your father.

1:01:33.390 --> 1:01:37.259
Emily, I did not
sign up for this, okay?

1:01:38.762 --> 1:01:40.762
It's over.
I mean it.

1:01:40.764 --> 1:01:43.031
No, it's not over.
It's not over.

1:01:43.033 --> 1:01:44.166
-Emily--
-It can't be over.

1:01:44.168 --> 1:01:46.368
-Wake up!
-No.

1:01:46.370 --> 1:01:47.903
What else
are we supposed to do?

1:01:47.905 --> 1:01:50.105
-They know where we are!
-The only thing to do!

1:01:50.107 --> 1:01:53.942
We stick to the plan
and we finish this.

1:01:53.944 --> 1:01:55.410
Are you with me?

1:02:15.165 --> 1:02:16.998

You look hot,
that's enough.

1:02:18.268 --> 1:02:20.402
Okay, good, because
I am all out of fake IDs.

1:02:20.404 --> 1:02:22.137
You're gonna be fine. Okay?

1:02:22.139 --> 1:02:23.739
You've got this.

1:02:24.007 --> 1:02:25.340
-Good?
-Yeah. Good.

1:02:25.342 --> 1:02:26.408
Okay.

Now would be a great time
for this to work.

1:03:45.455 --> 1:03:46.454
I can do this.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:58.133
Excuse me,
does anybody have the time?

1:03:58.135 --> 1:04:00.001
The time?

1:04:00.003 --> 1:04:02.838
Nobody has a phone
or a watch or anything?

1:04:03.574 --> 1:04:05.607
Honey, for you,

1:04:05.609 --> 1:04:08.376
I've got all the time
in the world.

1:04:10.414 --> 1:04:12.013
Why don't you sit down?

1:04:12.950 --> 1:04:14.549
Thanks anyway.

1:04:15.485 --> 1:04:17.519
Now, now, don't be rude.

1:04:18.455 --> 1:04:19.888
Sit with us.

1:04:20.624 --> 1:04:21.890
Have a drink.

1:04:35.439 --> 1:04:36.504
What's your name?

1:04:37.541 --> 1:04:40.041
Um, what's yours?

1:04:40.043 --> 1:04:42.878
Friends call me "Staxx."

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:45.614
First name "Big."

1:04:46.550 --> 1:04:48.183
I get it.

1:04:49.253 --> 1:04:51.586
You look nervous
about something.

1:04:51.588 --> 1:04:53.188
Doesn't she look nervous?

1:05:02.199 --> 1:05:05.200
Come on, Em. Come on.

1:05:05.202 --> 1:05:06.368
[Staxx]
Don't worry, honey.

1:05:06.370 --> 1:05:07.936
You don't have to be scared.

1:05:09.273 --> 1:05:12.607
Play your cards right,
I might even show you my car.

1:05:12.609 --> 1:05:14.542
Sounds rad.

1:05:20.517 --> 1:05:23.184
Women and their purses...

1:05:23.186 --> 1:05:25.453
What you got in there,
anyway? Crown jewels?

1:05:25.455 --> 1:05:28.924
[chuckling]
Nothing. Just girl stuff.

1:05:30.127 --> 1:05:33.528
Ask your friends, they know
what I'm talking about.

1:05:38.235 --> 1:05:40.302

1:06:22.279 --> 1:06:23.545
Go.

1:06:33.457 --> 1:06:35.056
[Max] What happened in there?

1:06:35.058 --> 1:06:36.758
He got a little
friendlier than I planned.

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:39.594
You actually talked
to the owner? Jesus, Em!

1:06:39.596 --> 1:06:41.029
Like I had a choice!

1:06:41.431 --> 1:06:43.298
Okay, pull over.
I want to drive.

1:06:43.300 --> 1:06:45.633

You always get to drive.

[Emily] Cops?

1:06:51.441 --> 1:06:53.742
Worse. I think that's Nestor.

1:07:05.288 --> 1:07:06.688
I warned them
not to mess with me.

Seriously, Max,
you really need to let me drive.

Well, what do you want me to do?

1:07:56.289 --> 1:07:57.472

I can just pull over.

[Female dispatcher]
All units be advised.

Female suspects wanted
on multiple counts

1:08:49.459 --> 1:08:52.527

west at high speed

1:09:02.839 --> 1:09:04.372
Hmm?

1:09:04.374 --> 1:09:05.773
The plan? The endgame?

1:09:07.677 --> 1:09:09.711
Don't worry. Your daughter
will be here soon enough

1:09:09.713 --> 1:09:12.147
and you'll never have
to see me again.

1:09:12.149 --> 1:09:13.915
Hmm.

1:09:13.917 --> 1:09:16.184
That's a relief.

1:09:16.186 --> 1:09:18.486
The feeling is mutual,
believe me.

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:25.627
How much are you making
on this deal, anyway?

1:09:25.629 --> 1:09:27.662
Oh, a lot.

1:09:27.664 --> 1:09:30.365
My buyer is very committed
to owning this vehicle

1:09:30.367 --> 1:09:34.335
and he is not the kind of man
you want to make unhappy.

1:09:35.572 --> 1:09:38.773
Why? Is your buyer
a crime boss?

1:09:38.775 --> 1:09:40.775
Actually, yes.

1:09:41.912 --> 1:09:43.878
And it just so happens
that your daughter

1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:46.948
is stealing from a local
thug who pissed him off.

1:09:49.653 --> 1:09:51.553
Relax, Gail.

1:09:51.555 --> 1:09:53.621
Emily can take care of herself.

1:09:56.459 --> 1:10:00.628
Assuming my daughter comes
through for you, then what?

1:10:03.233 --> 1:10:07.235
You don't seem like the
strippers and coke type.

1:10:07.237 --> 1:10:09.437
If you must know,
it's seed money.

1:10:25.488 --> 1:10:27.555
Costa Rica.

1:10:33.897 --> 1:10:35.496
You think it's...

1:10:36.499 --> 1:10:38.399
such a good idea
to be telling me this

1:10:39.502 --> 1:10:41.236
if the plan is to let me go?

1:10:45.508 --> 1:10:47.575
You're not planning

It's nearly midnight.
She's still not here.

1:11:46.736 --> 1:11:48.703
If I were you, I'd be
thinking about plan B.

Do me a favour--
stop talking. Yeah?

1:11:50.774 --> 1:11:52.440
Or what?

1:11:52.442 --> 1:11:54.509
You'll kill me twice?

I have to make this quick.

1:12:05.588 --> 1:12:08.089

I hate to break it to you, Em,

only bargaining chip.

Hey, we know you're there!

1:14:28.198 --> 1:14:30.698
No. There's no way.

1:14:30.700 --> 1:14:31.899
Beggars can't be choosers.
Come on.

1:14:31.901 --> 1:14:33.067

Hey, Em, it's me.

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:06.013
Mom! Where are you?

1:18:06.015 --> 1:18:08.315
I'm at Curnow's farm.
Okay, listen to me.

1:18:08.317 --> 1:18:11.152
Don't come here, okay?
Whatever you do.

1:18:11.154 --> 1:18:13.120
-What? Why?
-Because he's gonna kill you.

1:18:13.122 --> 1:18:15.356
Listen, just go to the police
and tell them everything.

1:18:16.793 --> 1:18:17.275
But--

1:18:17.276 --> 1:18:17.758
Just do it, okay?

1:18:42.151 --> 1:18:43.935
Everyone, mount up!

[Officer] Right, copy that.
Let's go! Move out! Move out!

1:18:46.756 --> 1:18:48.322
Okay, let's just calm down

1:18:48.324 --> 1:18:50.057
and think about this
for a second.

1:18:51.461 --> 1:18:53.060
You don't really
want to do this.

1:18:55.131 --> 1:18:57.965
Your daughter just
cost me a lot of money.

1:19:00.169 --> 1:19:01.769

Believe me,
it makes it easier.

[Gail] I-I promise I'm not going
to tell anyone about this.

1:19:19.355 --> 1:19:21.522
[Mr. Curnow] Nope.
No, you will not.

She said he
was going to kill her.

1:19:32.135 --> 1:19:33.834
Do you think he already--

1:19:33.836 --> 1:19:37.772
No! He still wants
the Hummer, right?

1:19:37.774 --> 1:19:41.208
If he kills her,
he gets nothing.

1:19:41.210 --> 1:19:42.476
Yeah, right.

1:19:42.478 --> 1:19:44.979
But we don't have
the Hummer anymore.

1:19:44.981 --> 1:19:47.081
Damn it.
[sighing]

1:19:47.083 --> 1:19:49.049

Can you just please
let me go?

1:20:03.866 --> 1:20:05.199
You're already ahead
of the game, right?

1:20:05.201 --> 1:20:06.934
You've got money.
You can leave the country.

1:20:06.936 --> 1:20:08.335
[Mr. Curnow]
Do I need to gag you?

1:20:09.839 --> 1:20:11.906
-No.
-Good.

1:20:24.387 --> 1:20:26.020

1:20:43.306 --> 1:20:44.305
What do we do?

1:20:44.307 --> 1:20:47.074
He's a convicted felon
and we're the police.

1:20:48.010 --> 1:20:49.143
We can arrest him.

1:21:12.902 --> 1:21:14.235
Get out of the car!

1:21:18.574 --> 1:21:20.174
You better do as she says.

1:21:22.011 --> 1:21:23.077
This isn't right.

1:21:27.984 --> 1:21:29.049
[Max]
Let me try.

1:21:30.152 --> 1:21:32.186
Okay. Um...

1:21:32.188 --> 1:21:34.922
You heard her.
Get out of the car

1:21:34.924 --> 1:21:36.223
and put your hands
above your head.

1:21:37.627 --> 1:21:39.026

1:22:01.918 --> 1:22:03.250
Em, I told you not to come!

1:22:03.252 --> 1:22:04.652
You should've
listened to her, kid.

Leave her!

Nice paint job, Em.

Dad would be proud.

the family name through the mud

1:23:30.406 --> 1:23:32.773
and had to do
community service for a year?

1:23:32.775 --> 1:23:35.509
Helped put some bad
people in jail.

If he's happy with it,
so am I.

1:23:38.714 --> 1:23:40.647
Your mom is so cool.

1:23:40.649 --> 1:23:42.082
My mom has me
grounded for, like,

1:23:42.084 --> 1:23:43.550
the next
ten years of my life.

1:23:45.721 --> 1:23:47.454
[Gail] Aren't they expecting you
down at the scrapyard?

1:23:47.456 --> 1:23:49.056
You're gonna be late for work.

1:23:49.058 --> 1:23:50.791
[Emily] It's okay.
I'm dating the owner's son.

No way.

1:24:02.505 --> 1:24:04.104
Passed with flying colors.

1:24:04.106 --> 1:24:05.506
Well, I'd expect no less.

1:24:06.742 --> 1:24:10.544
Hey, um, can I get a ride with
you guys, perhaps?

1:24:10.546 --> 1:24:11.745
Thanks.

1:24:14.116 --> 1:24:16.233
Remember what I said--

1:24:16.234 --> 1:24:18.351

this car goes out on eBay.
