01:00.932 --> 01:02.557
A keeper of secrets.

01:04.905 --> 01:06.032
This is what I am.

01:08.337 --> 01:10.064
what I too have become.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.560
September 15th, 1920.

01:46.918 --> 01:49.660
Morning air brings with it, hope...

01:50.624 --> 01:53.491
a lingering sense of peace
captured in the stillness.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.484
For the most part, all is normal.

01:59.317 --> 02:01.223
Since the passing of our parents

02:01.562 --> 02:03.711
the life at Gleep House
had settled down into a

02:04.129 --> 02:07.196
passion of routine and unrelenting work

02:08.264 --> 02:10.896
the roles that of myself and my sister Tilly

02:11.559 --> 02:13.384
dovetailed with... #

02:15.401 --> 02:19.295
I have known and worked alongside
Tom Noolan since I was a girl.

02:20.196 --> 02:21.798
Since papa's passing

02:22.422 --> 02:24.109
I have come to depend on him

02:24.767 --> 02:25.806
as I would a brother.

02:26.239 --> 02:27.567
This is a private matter.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.242
So I do apologize.

02:30.189 --> 02:31.158
Is everything alright?

02:32.212 --> 02:35.509
Tom, you've been a good friend of
ours for many years and I know...

02:36.053 --> 02:38.319
I know my father would not be
best pleased to hear me say this

02:39.569 --> 02:41.452
but I have to make the important
decision for the house.

02:42.155 --> 02:44.819
And with things the way they
are, I have no choice. I must...

02:45.070 --> 02:46.218
sell another field.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.504
Oh! I'm sorry. I did not realize
that things were that bad.

02:51.744 --> 02:53.861
Well, perhaps, you could consider,

02:53.954 --> 02:56.832
which field might fetch a considerable
sum and make the arrangements.

02:59.113 --> 02:59.879
And also...

03:00.442 --> 03:03.120
poor Tilly need not trouble
herself with such matters.

03:05.048 --> 03:05.813
Yes, Miss May.

03:06.549 --> 03:09.072
In fact, keep this as quiet as you can.

03:09.579 --> 03:10.298
Of course.

03:11.407 --> 03:12.071
Thank you Tom.

03:13.238 --> 03:13.987
And I'm...

03:14.367 --> 03:16.041
I'm sure your father would understand.

03:30.963 --> 03:34.331
Tom rarely speaks of his only son, Jackie.

03:35.126 --> 03:38.391
Not yet 20, and if local gossip is trusted...

03:39.269 --> 03:43.127
wild and heady buck who is
very possibly an active member

03:43.240 --> 03:45.135
of the local IRA volunteer brigade

03:53.955 --> 03:56.385
Despite our financial struggles and the...

03:56.845 --> 03:59.134
unspoken threat that is all around us...

04:00.579 --> 04:01.579
we are surviving...

04:02.709 --> 04:03.873
as best we can.

04:04.295 --> 04:05.443
I found a new journal...

04:06.240 --> 04:08.266
and just the right combination

04:12.432 --> 04:16.291
It is now late evening and the
peaceful silence that falls

04:16.587 --> 04:18.314
blankets the house like a veil.

04:22.185 --> 04:24.958
Though the future is uncertain...

04:26.417 --> 04:29.323
I must continue to show strength in...

04:29.660 --> 04:30.472
word...

04:31.211 --> 04:31.863
deed...

04:32.813 --> 04:33.771
and action.

04:57.249 --> 04:59.387
Hold your guns. Hold your guns... #

04:59.732 --> 05:00.724
#

05:10.099 --> 05:11.208
#

05:13.444 --> 05:14.358
Sergeant?

07:29.533 --> 07:30.494
Tilly!

07:31.199 --> 07:32.270
Tilly, I need you.

07:39.256 --> 07:40.810
What's the great emergency?

07:41.874 --> 07:42.631
Come with me.

07:49.646 --> 07:51.443
-Oh, dear Lord, is he dead?
-No.

07:52.188 --> 07:54.314
You must be calm, Tilly. We have
to deal with this immediately.

07:54.882 --> 07:55.944
Who is he?

07:56.330 --> 07:59.525
Tilly, take hold of his leg. We
must shift him from this position.

08:19.525 --> 08:20.665
Fetch some clean sheets.

08:23.889 --> 08:25.642
We'll see he doesn't die on us.

08:39.823 --> 08:40.659
How is he, May?

08:41.703 --> 08:42.250
Shh!

08:43.890 --> 08:44.725
There's someone.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.809
Shall I go get the dcotor?

08:54.126 --> 08:54.876
There's no time.

08:55.981 --> 08:58.585
We must get off to the back room and see
to these wound before it's too late.

08:58.646 --> 09:00.002
What? That doesn't make any sense.

09:00.063 --> 09:01.928
-Do you want to let the man die?
-No, of course not!

09:01.989 --> 09:03.108
Well then, think straight.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.057
Go into the store, inside the stables.

09:06.543 --> 09:09.106
In the corner under some blankets,
you'll find papa's old chair...

09:10.126 --> 09:11.634
that'll help us get him upstairs.

09:18.608 --> 09:20.037
Gently, gently.

09:21.623 --> 09:22.646
#

10:04.565 --> 10:05.518
Well, will he live?

10:08.134 --> 10:09.181
Too soon to say.

10:12.199 --> 10:12.925
But...

10:13.889 --> 10:16.107
there are no major arteries cut and...

10:16.787 --> 10:18.216
there seems to be good clotting.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.234
Oh... Tilly.

10:23.755 --> 10:24.715
You're quaint.

10:27.151 --> 10:28.768
We'll do for him as much as we can and...

10:29.197 --> 10:31.010
the rest we'll leave to God's mercy.

10:33.539 --> 10:35.062
I've done all we can for him now.

10:37.161 --> 10:40.482
And he seems to look more human
now he's cleaned up a bit.

10:41.184 --> 10:42.802
Not a bad looking chap, I thought.

28:03.465 --> 28:07.457
I am delighted to see you awake to us and
the world this morning, Captain Shearing.

28:11.190 --> 28:11.960
Perhaps...

28:12.218 --> 28:15.049
you do not fully recall the
other evening's conversation.

28:16.882 --> 28:19.226
Perhaps, we did no fully
introdcue ourselves to you.

28:19.949 --> 28:21.870
I am May Collingwood.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.539
And this is my...

28:24.148 --> 28:25.601
# sister Tilly.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.234
Tilly, go have your breakfast.

28:29.681 --> 28:30.533
I can get a meal here.

28:36.059 --> 28:37.387
I brought these up

28:38.981 --> 28:40.850
so you can at least communicate with us.

29:10.190 --> 29:10.917
Doctor.

29:12.771 --> 29:13.373
Me?

29:15.882 --> 29:16.453
Although...

29:16.952 --> 29:18.569
# I was a nurse once.

29:25.275 --> 29:25.962
So...

29:27.717 --> 29:30.498
Captain James Shearing.

29:32.009 --> 29:34.236
How long have been staged at
the barracks in Phillipstown?

30:34.380 --> 30:37.653
-Now Captain Shearing, it's time...
-You're not going to beleive this May.

30:40.579 --> 30:41.438
Believe what?

30:44.295 --> 30:45.115
Hello May.

30:48.666 --> 30:49.565
You're speaking.

30:50.617 --> 30:51.226
Yes.

30:51.470 --> 30:53.642
-Well, don't try to say too much...
-Oh, May, please!

30:54.375 --> 30:57.874
It's because of your wonderful nursing
skills that James is now speaking again.

30:57.935 --> 30:58.432
James?

31:01.169 --> 31:02.271
How are you feeling today?

31:03.020 --> 31:03.934
So...

31:05.399 --> 31:08.586
Take it easy. Those wounds
do need a lot of attention.

31:09.482 --> 31:10.521
But you're doing great.

31:11.736 --> 31:12.947
I helped James with this.

31:14.234 --> 31:15.015
What's this?

31:15.448 --> 31:16.744
It's for my parents.

31:17.370 --> 31:19.167
To let them know he is good hands.

31:21.860 --> 31:23.446
Of course, he is in good hands.

31:26.296 --> 31:27.155
I'll see to it.

31:33.148 --> 31:34.601
I want to remind you of something.

31:35.492 --> 31:37.734
He's still a patient of ours.

31:39.041 --> 31:40.885
It's only natural, now that he has..

31:41.181 --> 31:45.048
regained full consciousness, that our
personal relationships with him will change.

31:45.839 --> 31:49.222
But we ourselves must keep
a professional distance.

31:50.251 --> 31:51.009
Of course.

32:06.338 --> 32:07.525
The sun rises...

32:07.918 --> 32:09.137
and the sun sets.

32:10.441 --> 32:13.074
The hours in between moved with a slow...

32:13.247 --> 32:14.473
rythmic pattern...

32:14.848 --> 32:16.824
of the usual seasonal labours.

32:18.346 --> 32:22.205
Tilly and I continued to watch over
and attend to our wounded patient.

32:24.188 --> 32:26.501
I tried to imagine his family background...

32:27.077 --> 32:30.030
and his life as a soldier in the trenches.

32:32.268 --> 32:34.624
What horrors had he
witnessed in the Great War?

32:36.711 --> 32:38.550
I recall my father saying that...

32:38.731 --> 32:42.528
the wounds we don't see on the flesh
are the wounds that never heal.

32:43.030 --> 32:46.663
And ulimately cause the most suffering
and damage to those who carry them.

32:50.132 --> 32:51.031
I am becoming...

32:51.321 --> 32:52.234
acutely...

32:52.407 --> 32:55.815
aware of a familiar notion
running up inside me, a...

32:56.436 --> 33:00.783
strong and tender regard for this
once dying and broken soldier,

33:00.844 --> 33:02.619
whom I've cared for all these months.

33:05.073 --> 33:06.307
I lost to love before.

33:07.612 --> 33:09.003
I do not intend to lose again.

33:24.768 --> 33:26.034
Three glasses, Till?

33:27.053 --> 33:27.662
Yes.

33:28.076 --> 33:29.014
One's for James.

33:30.647 --> 33:31.616
I'll take it up to him.

33:34.023 --> 33:36.344
It perhaps will seek to
raise his low spirits.

34:05.494 --> 34:06.916
Boy! Boy!

34:07.571 --> 34:08.384
Nobody panic.

34:11.420 --> 34:12.228
Is this your home?

34:12.853 --> 34:14.260
No. I just work here.

34:14.463 --> 34:15.268
What's your name?

34:16.864 --> 34:17.592
Tom Nolan.

34:17.929 --> 34:18.679
It's my home.

34:19.408 --> 34:20.647
Along with my sister Tilly.

34:22.585 --> 34:23.570
You're a Collingwood right?

34:24.194 --> 34:25.542
May Collingwood.

34:25.714 --> 34:26.418
Well, May...

34:26.884 --> 34:27.659
where is she at?

34:30.022 --> 34:31.350
I imagine she's inside.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.355
-Does anyone else live here?
-No.

34:36.496 --> 34:38.284
A few months ago, we lost one of our men.

34:39.117 --> 34:40.289
It happened close to her.

34:40.600 --> 34:41.647
And we haven't found him.

34:42.327 --> 34:43.647
I reckon, somebody knows something.

34:43.936 --> 34:45.389
Well, we don't know anything.

34:49.195 --> 34:50.203
Thst's what everybody says.

34:50.898 --> 34:51.905
Well, we found this.

34:56.150 --> 34:57.284
It was found close to here.

34:57.824 --> 34:59.815
So somebody heard soemthing,
seen something...

34:59.876 --> 35:02.188
If we had seen anything at the time,

35:02.249 --> 35:04.147
we would have come forward
with that information.

35:06.910 --> 35:09.121
I'm in these fields everyday.
Surely, I'd have seen some thing.

35:09.613 --> 35:11.004
Well, you didn't see this, did ya?

35:11.540 --> 35:12.103
No!

35:13.036 --> 35:14.335
What exactly do you do here?

35:15.734 --> 35:16.445
Farmhand.

35:27.236 --> 35:30.291
That's quite a big house for two
women to live in all alone out here.

35:32.061 --> 35:32.991
What of your parents?

35:36.672 --> 35:37.922
They are both deceased.

35:38.983 --> 35:41.038
My father came here in 1880.

35:41.468 --> 35:43.499
He was a Colonel in the British Army.

35:45.576 --> 35:46.123
Really?

35:51.072 --> 35:53.447
Now I coud see myself in a
house like that some day...

35:54.710 --> 35:56.335
when all this madness is over.

35:59.441 --> 36:00.980
Do you mind if I have a little look around?

36:03.633 --> 36:04.423
Of course.

36:05.845 --> 36:08.415
You and your men are
welcome to some tea also.

36:09.288 --> 36:09.944
Wait.

36:12.462 --> 36:13.532
I apologize.

36:13.977 --> 36:15.950
I have to return to the
barracks for a debriefing.

36:16.771 --> 36:17.716
Another time perhaps.

36:19.747 --> 36:21.223
Our door is always open.

36:23.216 --> 36:24.091
Next time it is.

37:10.049 --> 37:10.604
May...

37:11.692 --> 37:12.911
James wants to see you.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.304
What is it?

37:23.522 --> 37:24.405
I'm leaving.

37:24.662 --> 37:26.385
I want to return to my regiment.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.318
Captain, I fear you are
not in your right mind.

37:29.379 --> 37:30.060
Of course, I am.

37:30.598 --> 37:32.762
Tilly told me that they were here
and they were wearing my clothes.

37:32.823 --> 37:35.579
Captain, you not yet well enough to go
anywhere. Please return to your bed.

37:35.640 --> 37:38.813
May. I thank you for the kindness
you showed me, but please...

37:38.921 --> 37:39.890
fetch me my uniform.

37:40.083 --> 37:43.122
-Captain, get back into bed.
-I want to leave.

37:43.612 --> 37:46.084
They were here looking for me and
you kept me locked up an you...

37:46.964 --> 37:48.206
Ah!

37:48.605 --> 37:50.582
What do you think will happen
to us here if you do leave?

37:51.748 --> 37:56.084
Our lives will be at risk and our home will
be burnt to ground. I will not allow that.

38:01.832 --> 38:02.894
Our care...

38:03.691 --> 38:05.285
I can guarantee you.

38:09.031 --> 38:11.921
All I ask in return is that
you consider our safety.

38:39.829 --> 38:41.544
#

38:43.469 --> 38:44.547
You'd be surprised.

38:46.496 --> 38:46.949
May I?

38:47.699 --> 38:48.230
Of course.

39:00.751 --> 39:01.446
That good?

39:03.837 --> 39:04.696
Yes, it is.

39:05.392 --> 39:06.782
It is a collection of poetry.

39:07.198 --> 39:08.393
You can borrow it if you like.

39:14.199 --> 39:14.723
Here.

39:15.168 --> 39:15.918
Happy Christmas.

39:17.501 --> 39:18.454
It's just something small.

39:19.509 --> 39:20.460
Jackie, you shouldn't have.

39:20.743 --> 39:22.249
Like I say, it's just something small.

39:29.361 --> 39:31.096
Don't know how you can sit out here.
I'm freezing.

39:38.862 --> 39:39.807
Thank you for the present.

39:40.336 --> 39:40.935
Really.

39:52.278 --> 39:53.036
My pleasure.

40:19.312 --> 40:20.281
You're warm enough now?

40:20.728 --> 40:21.689
Yes. Thank you.

40:24.706 --> 40:25.753
Well, eat now.

40:26.809 --> 40:28.685
I promised James, I'd finish these chapters.

40:29.357 --> 40:30.045
You go ahead.

41:33.618 --> 41:35.353
You have to have a candle on Christmas eve.

41:36.177 --> 41:37.005
It's nice.

41:37.996 --> 41:38.707
Thank you.

41:43.719 --> 41:45.641
I'm sure you are thinking
about your family tonight.

41:51.178 --> 41:54.077
I'd say I was the same when I
was in France during the war.

41:55.898 --> 41:57.648
Not knowing if I was alive or dead.

42:00.571 --> 42:02.079
I still have nightmares.

42:03.410 --> 42:04.980
You have nothing to be afraid of here.

42:06.528 --> 42:09.006
If it wasn't for you, who knows
what might have happened.

42:14.993 --> 42:16.345
May is the one that saved you.

42:16.415 --> 42:17.579
She is the nurse.

42:22.577 --> 42:23.319
Do you think...

42:26.411 --> 42:28.442
Would you like to join us for
Christmas dinner tomorrow?

42:32.677 --> 42:33.396
I'd like that.

42:35.251 --> 42:35.767
Good.

42:47.230 --> 42:49.757
I don't know why I never put
them in the same place.

42:51.043 --> 42:51.793
What's wrong?

42:51.977 --> 42:52.727
The jug.

42:53.352 --> 42:54.313
That right?

42:58.241 --> 42:58.855
Tilly...

42:59.593 --> 43:00.609
You're not ready.

43:01.793 --> 43:02.707
Go on without me.

43:03.395 --> 43:06.590
I just think it will be lonesome for
James to be on his own on Christmas eve.

43:07.539 --> 43:11.531
I'm sure he will be perfectly
alright by himself for a few hours.

43:12.293 --> 43:16.707
Besides, I gave Mrs Johnson
my word, we'd both be there.

43:17.427 --> 43:18.575
Tell her I'm under the weather.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.771
We haven't missed a Christmas eve...

43:22.909 --> 43:24.018
in years, Tilly.

43:26.526 --> 43:28.401
This year's a little different though, May.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.292
You made sure of that.

44:21.744 --> 44:22.682
Christmas toast?

44:23.942 --> 44:25.075
To what should I toast?

44:25.472 --> 44:26.714
To your health, of course.

44:27.272 --> 44:28.289
To your kindness.

44:29.004 --> 44:30.145
To health and kindness.

46:02.519 --> 46:03.511
Good morning, Tilly.

46:03.848 --> 46:04.996
Merry Christmas, May.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.180
Many happy returns.

46:10.808 --> 46:13.074
Hard to believe another Christmas is upon us.

46:13.873 --> 46:14.967
I must prepare.

46:15.184 --> 46:16.129
What do you think, you're doing?

46:17.688 --> 46:18.282
Pardon?

46:19.679 --> 46:22.863
Well, I was thinking we should set up
the table in Captain Shearing's room.

46:24.644 --> 46:25.980
He is joining us, isn't he?

46:27.566 --> 46:29.575
But I don't think we should take any chances.

46:43.130 --> 46:44.755
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

46:45.242 --> 46:45.914
Sorry.

46:46.227 --> 46:47.047
I was with me dad.

46:48.517 --> 46:50.251
You sure you want to put your...

46:50.682 --> 46:52.903
# lady friends for dinner, huh?

46:56.069 --> 46:57.821
I was thinkin' about that house.

46:58.803 --> 47:01.569
I heard the Tom's were around,
but didn't touch the place.#

47:02.543 --> 47:03.418
Why was that?

47:04.099 --> 47:04.817
I don't know.

47:06.681 --> 47:07.806
You want to help us right?

47:09.158 --> 47:10.017
I was thinking...

47:10.885 --> 47:13.315
why don't you find a safe
place to hide those guns?

47:16.802 --> 47:17.677
#

47:18.473 --> 47:19.012
Nay.

47:20.452 --> 47:20.839
No.

47:21.271 --> 47:22.294
That's not the place for them.

47:23.164 --> 47:24.899
The alternative is...

47:25.529 --> 47:27.591
we pay a visit to your employers...

47:29.974 --> 47:31.943
and see how loyal they actually are.

47:33.587 --> 47:36.204
You'll be ashamed to see a house
like that burnt to the ground

47:36.837 --> 47:38.075
like so many of ours.

47:41.927 --> 47:42.419
All right.

47:43.216 --> 47:44.099
I'll hide the guns.

47:45.341 --> 47:46.716
It's a safe place in the yard.

47:47.155 --> 47:47.859
The store house

47:49.896 --> 47:50.646
Go man.

47:54.262 --> 47:55.192
Ans don't worry.

47:57.185 --> 47:58.505
You'll learn to trust nobody.

48:00.627 --> 48:01.798
Merry Christmas.

48:06.378 --> 48:07.190
Thank you...

48:07.519 --> 48:08.167
for...

48:08.409 --> 48:10.019
all these wonderful gifts.

48:11.059 --> 48:11.567
and...

48:11.941 --> 48:13.879
thank you for a greater gift...

48:15.419 --> 48:16.373
that of my life.

48:18.946 --> 48:19.813
Merry Christmas...

48:20.923 --> 48:21.993
to both you good ladies.

48:23.345 --> 48:24.875
Bravo, Captain Shearing.

48:25.765 --> 48:26.280
Bravo.

48:34.555 --> 48:35.610
Well, shall we eat?

48:53.277 --> 48:55.046
Do you think you will ever go back to India?

48:56.052 --> 48:57.380
Almost 20 years, James.

48:57.888 --> 48:58.763
It's a long time.

49:00.626 --> 49:01.575
It didn't go without me.

49:02.861 --> 49:04.079
We spoke Hindi, you know.

49:04.792 --> 49:05.659
-Really?
-Mmm.

49:06.855 --> 49:08.724
I don't speak any langauges... well...

49:09.162 --> 49:10.162
a litttle French...

49:12.595 --> 49:13.490
#

49:13.978 --> 49:17.033
They were such mysterious, exciting times.

49:17.958 --> 49:22.528
Our father used to take us horse riding
on the shimmering plains of Delhi.

49:23.424 --> 49:26.362
I remember mother taking us to
the open markets and bazaars.

49:27.073 --> 49:28.933
Bet you don't remember the time we got lost.

49:29.914 --> 49:30.656
Miss Tilly...

49:31.653 --> 49:33.153
Oh, I should like to hear this.

49:34.956 --> 49:35.760
Our mother...

49:36.396 --> 49:38.295
was haggling with a street trader...

49:38.789 --> 49:40.289
and Tilly and I stood...

49:40.698 --> 49:42.627
staring in fascination as a...

49:43.295 --> 49:46.654
snake charmer piped his exotic melody to a...

49:47.295 --> 49:48.571
sleepy eyed cobra.

49:49.834 --> 49:53.389
And suddeny I turned and Tilly
is no longer at my side.

49:53.676 --> 49:54.856
I don't remember this.

49:55.356 --> 49:56.318
Of course you don't.

50:02.796 --> 50:05.155
We plunge headlong into the crowd.

50:06.020 --> 50:08.527
And Tilly is nowhere to be seen.

50:10.407 --> 50:13.461
And after a few moments of panic...

50:16.328 --> 50:18.054
suddenly she is visible to me.

50:19.169 --> 50:22.215
And upon seeing me, she
wrapped her arms around me...

50:22.953 --> 50:26.008
and we returned to the safety
of our mother's embrace.

50:26.719 --> 50:27.938
You must've been very frightened.

50:29.146 --> 50:30.287
I really don't remember.

50:31.732 --> 50:33.794
From that day, you hardly ever left my side.

50:35.548 --> 50:37.954
She became as my shadow,
she was to be found not...

50:38.522 --> 50:39.772
two steps behind me.

50:41.752 --> 50:43.361
Even here at Kleep house, you...

50:43.892 --> 50:45.009
you have me look out for you.

50:46.958 --> 50:48.396
at least that's how she used to be.

50:52.590 --> 50:55.004
That was me talking while
the night is still...

50:57.605 --> 50:59.508
Leave everything to the morning.

51:00.122 --> 51:01.395
Tilly and I will take our leave.

51:03.155 --> 51:05.248
Thak you for all of this.

51:22.371 --> 51:25.090
This day of peace and
renewal has in its gift...

51:25.251 --> 51:28.204
the power to bound and heal all wounds.

51:29.777 --> 51:33.245
The pain of simply being alive
these times is lessened...

51:33.714 --> 51:36.972
by an emotion I have long since suppressed.

53:05.558 --> 53:06.362
Good morning, May.

53:07.545 --> 53:08.498
Captain Shearing!

53:10.295 --> 53:12.740
I think maybe you are well
enough now to wash yourself.

53:13.729 --> 53:15.424
There is hot water and soap buds.

53:15.994 --> 53:17.689
Let us know if you need anything else.

53:18.497 --> 53:19.090
May...

53:24.081 --> 53:25.557
Nothing... sorry.

53:32.922 --> 53:34.844
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

53:35.007 --> 53:37.475
Happy New Year, ma'am. Happy New Year, ma'am.

53:45.744 --> 53:48.010
Do you know if Jackie's coming
over for dinner tomorrow?

53:49.299 --> 53:49.862
Hello.

53:50.344 --> 53:50.922
Hello.

53:51.688 --> 53:53.282
I would imagine so, yes.

53:55.071 --> 53:56.981
I heard again about him in that ambush.

53:58.999 --> 54:00.881
Tilly, don't go saying any of this to Tom.

54:01.415 --> 54:03.946
You are to act normally, for everyone's sake.

54:04.313 --> 54:05.212
So you heard it too.

54:07.894 --> 54:09.066
He likes you too.

54:10.161 --> 54:12.013
You can always use that
if the time ever comes.

54:23.380 --> 54:26.356
I must say, Miss Tilly, every
year, your cooking delights me.

54:28.356 --> 54:30.332
Well, we like to keep father's tradition.

54:31.347 --> 54:33.214
And you are very dear to us, Tom.

54:34.585 --> 54:35.648
Isn't that right, Tilly?

54:37.346 --> 54:38.096
Tilly..

54:39.417 --> 54:40.589
Oh, yes...

54:41.776 --> 54:42.573
Happy New Year.

54:44.600 --> 54:45.662
Here's to a better year.

54:46.037 --> 54:47.201
to 1921.

55:14.332 --> 55:18.412
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,

55:18.473 --> 55:22.081
And never brought to mind?

55:22.461 --> 55:26.804
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,

55:26.912 --> 55:30.764
And days o' lang syne!

55:31.490 --> 55:35.806
For auld lang syne, my dear

55:35.867 --> 55:39.830
For auld lang syne,

55:40.337 --> 55:44.947
We?ll tak a cup o' kindness yet

55:45.376 --> 55:49.548
For auld lang syne!

57:31.749 --> 57:32.655
I'm sorry, May...

57:33.421 --> 57:35.521
Go, go go!

58:03.214 --> 58:04.348
What are you thinking about?

58:06.047 --> 58:07.127
I was just thinking...

58:07.675 --> 58:08.955
#

58:09.315 --> 58:10.175
But you did.

58:11.732 --> 58:12.339
Fate.

58:14.327 --> 58:17.321
#

58:18.935 --> 58:19.928
The where would you go?

58:21.913 --> 58:23.853
Well, I'm not going anywhere without you.

58:25.473 --> 58:26.766
Well, I'm not a fool, James.

58:27.313 --> 58:28.386
You don't have to pretend.

58:28.464 --> 58:29.857
Tilly, I've been thinking about it.

58:30.917 --> 58:32.504
I don't want to go back to my regiment.

58:34.307 --> 58:35.607
So, what are you going to do?

58:37.594 --> 58:38.901
I'm going to marry you.

58:40.544 --> 58:41.564
Is that a proposal?

58:42.273 --> 58:42.867
Why not?

58:43.857 --> 58:46.471
I don't know if you're being
serious or just fooling me.

58:46.803 --> 58:47.383
Tilly...

58:49.109 --> 58:50.062
will you marry me?

58:52.843 --> 58:53.663
Of course.

58:57.642 --> 58:59.428
How do you feel about
going to Argentina?

58:59.695 --> 59:01.055
I've never really thought about it.

59:01.141 --> 59:04.393
Well, I can't go home and I don't think #

59:04.983 --> 59:06.376
Well, you've obviously
thought about this.

59:06.728 --> 59:07.581
Of course, I have.

59:08.808 --> 59:10.968
We'll make our way to
the Port of Cove and...

59:11.221 --> 59:13.661
board the first available
ship to the Americas.

59:14.437 --> 59:16.238
We can have the ship's
captain board us en route

59:16.898 --> 59:17.971
We'll need money, though.

59:18.947 --> 59:20.974
We can write there, as man and wife.

59:23.257 --> 59:24.237
When will we leave?

59:25.068 --> 59:25.708
Soon.

59:28.585 --> 59:29.565
And what about May?

59:30.959 --> 59:31.986
We'll tell her together.

59:33.206 --> 59:33.673
No.

59:34.472 --> 59:35.372
No. Leave it to me.

59:36.033 --> 59:37.253
I need to tell her myself.

59:40.530 --> 59:43.210
Today, I have to accept things as they are...

59:43.870 --> 59:46.070
and not how I would wish them to be.

59:47.121 --> 59:50.838
Nothig could have prepared me for the way
things have unfolded under this roof.

59:52.347 --> 59:55.652
I sought to control matters
from day to day, but...

59:56.131 --> 59:58.625
the problems that have arisen
have come from within...

59:59.345 --> 01:00:02.171
and not, as I had feared from without.

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.418
I know now that I can no
longer control events...

01:00:09.733 --> 01:00:11.600
it is the events that control us.

01:00:13.439 --> 01:00:14.746
How this will end...

01:00:17.042 --> 01:00:18.235
only God knows.

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:25.770
#

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.250
He's gone to get the rest of the guns.

01:00:28.367 --> 01:00:29.100
Let's keep moving.

01:00:48.348 --> 01:00:48.908
Jackie!

01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:49.898
Tilly!

01:00:50.931 --> 01:00:51.911
What are you doing here?

01:00:52.118 --> 01:00:53.098
Tilly, it's not waht it looks like.

01:00:54.124 --> 01:00:55.863
I can't believe you have
put us in such danger.

01:00:55.924 --> 01:00:56.890
I'm sorry. really, I am.

01:00:57.573 --> 01:00:59.453
They've only been in there
a couple od days, I swear.

01:01:00.905 --> 01:01:02.225
I don't want to put you in harms way.

01:01:02.985 --> 01:01:04.772
Just get rid of them, please!

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:05.787
#

01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:09.212
#

01:01:09.907 --> 01:01:10.750
Why is that?

01:01:11.921 --> 01:01:12.667
Say good bye.

01:01:13.057 --> 01:01:13.524
What?

01:01:15.587 --> 01:01:16.361
I'm goin' away.

01:01:16.598 --> 01:01:17.258
I have to.

01:01:19.652 --> 01:01:21.225
Is there any point in asking why?

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:23.488
No.

01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:25.661
Just...

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:28.409
I'm goin' away for a while... don't know how
long.

01:01:30.167 --> 01:01:31.520
But you want to speak to May.

01:01:34.798 --> 01:01:35.505
You can tell her.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.050
Take care, Jackie.

01:01:52.741 --> 01:01:53.821
I've always like you, Tilly.

01:01:56.817 --> 01:01:58.110
I hope you don't think of me as a...

01:02:01.596 --> 01:02:02.543
#

01:02:05.873 --> 01:02:06.533
I do.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.785
This is how it is supposed to be.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.845
We make our decisions based on any give time.

01:02:18.505 --> 01:02:19.019
Well, then...

01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:22.029
another time.

01:02:34.805 --> 01:02:36.998
I'm surprsied at how
well they're healing.

01:02:38.305 --> 01:02:39.205
You're very lucky.

01:02:39.718 --> 01:02:42.125
Well, I'm feeling stronger,
I know that much.

01:02:45.997 --> 01:02:48.089
Do you think I should write another letter to
my parents

01:02:48.157 --> 01:02:50.356
given that there doesn't seem to be any
response.

01:02:51.866 --> 01:02:52.786
By all means.

01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:54.633
Besides...

01:02:55.756 --> 01:02:57.407
hopefully. we can orchestrate a way,

01:02:57.468 --> 01:02:59.089
for you to travel home
in the near future.

01:02:59.624 --> 01:03:01.071
So you've been talking to Tilly then?

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:02.813
No.

01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:03.919
Why?

01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:07.763
It's just we've been discussing it.

01:03:08.489 --> 01:03:10.096
Discusiing what?

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:12.968
Leaving.

01:03:17.566 --> 01:03:18.793
When were you going to tell me?

01:03:19.855 --> 01:03:20.795
Tell you what?

01:03:21.401 --> 01:03:23.654
About this little plan you've hatched?

01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:26.036
Did James tell you?

01:03:26.632 --> 01:03:27.507
No, he did not.

01:03:30.837 --> 01:03:33.423
I've been meaning to speak with
you for some time now, May.

01:03:41.058 --> 01:03:42.771
What is it that bothers you...

01:03:43.144 --> 01:03:43.844
child?

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:47.128
This matter concerns the Captain.

01:03:48.007 --> 01:03:49.280
James and I...

01:03:50.592 --> 01:03:51.872
He... and I...

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:53.245
we...

01:03:53.518 --> 01:03:54.139
we are...

01:03:54.605 --> 01:03:55.571
The Captain...

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.158
and you, are what?

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:01.225
What about the Captain and you?

01:04:03.085 --> 01:04:04.825
James and I... are in love.

01:04:06.524 --> 01:04:07.784
I love him, May...

01:04:08.064 --> 01:04:09.671
and he loves me in return.

01:04:10.464 --> 01:04:13.631
It is our intention to become man
and wife as soon as is possible.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.040
You and he are to be wed?

01:04:17.393 --> 01:04:19.876
James wanted to tell you, but I
thought it only wise and proper,

01:04:19.937 --> 01:04:21.750
that I should inform yoy myself

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.054
Do you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

01:04:34.331 --> 01:04:35.997
#

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:39.537
You and Captain Shearing are to marry?

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:43.484
Please just say that you've taken
leave of your senses, girl.

01:04:43.791 --> 01:04:46.158
We could leave this place,
we could leave this country.

01:04:46.548 --> 01:04:48.356
Under cover, and in disguise, if
necessary.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.636
Oh! Don't be ridiculous!

01:04:50.098 --> 01:04:53.191
A # officer, no less...
are you being so naive?

01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:56.174
What of his regiment # IRA?

01:04:57.172 --> 01:05:00.858
It'll be suicide for you both
and a death sentence for me.

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:03.432
We can start anew. We
love each other, May.

01:05:07.257 --> 01:05:08.237
What do you know of love?

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:11.182
You have not had a
single gentleman call,

01:05:11.243 --> 01:05:12.870
or come a' courting in your life.

01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:20.055
I have a right to live my life as I choose.

01:05:20.821 --> 01:05:23.268
And I choose to spend my life
with the man that I love...

01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:32.042
What do you even know of the Captain?

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:36.539
Has he told you of his past?

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:40.946
Captain Shearing is a soldier...

01:05:41.474 --> 01:05:44.174
and has lived a soldier's life.

01:05:46.615 --> 01:05:49.588
What do you even know of his
dalliances with other women?

01:05:51.744 --> 01:05:53.051
Oh, for pity's sake...

01:05:54.697 --> 01:05:55.701
wake up, girl...

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.867
and put this silly nonsense behind you.

01:06:01.908 --> 01:06:03.568
This is not nonsense...

01:06:03.848 --> 01:06:05.695
and it is not dalliance, as you put it.

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:07.875
James and I are in love.

01:06:09.129 --> 01:06:11.540
This impertinent infatuation
you feel for a man,

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.569
who is yet a stranger
to you, to us both.

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.894
Put it behind you, and
you will soon see,

01:06:16.955 --> 01:06:18.250
that I speak sense.

01:06:19.754 --> 01:06:21.141
You have never been in love.

01:06:22.046 --> 01:06:23.812
How can you lecture me on that emotion?

01:06:26.012 --> 01:06:28.169
You and the Captain thought
that you could rot

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:29.995
like base animals in this house,

01:06:30.056 --> 01:06:31.383
and not be detected?

01:06:33.009 --> 01:06:35.235
Well, I have known of
your sordid little affair

01:06:35.296 --> 01:06:37.073
since the very first night of your...

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.148
coming and going between
your room and his...

01:06:39.209 --> 01:06:41.004
like a cat on heat #

01:06:42.052 --> 01:06:42.852
I will not allow it!

01:06:42.913 --> 01:06:44.456
It must end here, it must end now!

01:06:45.188 --> 01:06:45.855
My God.

01:06:46.795 --> 01:06:47.748
I see it now.

01:06:49.288 --> 01:06:50.381
You are jealous.

01:06:51.978 --> 01:06:53.751
You resent our feelings for each other.

01:06:54.804 --> 01:06:56.204
Don't be ridiculous.

01:06:58.894 --> 01:07:01.173
You may be content, to
live your life here,

01:07:01.234 --> 01:07:03.685
as a dry, withered,
loveless, spinster...

01:07:05.967 --> 01:07:07.227
but I do not want that for me.

01:07:09.836 --> 01:07:12.595
When we have made our final plans, I will
inform you.

01:07:59.297 --> 01:07:59.964
Hello, Tom!

01:08:01.024 --> 01:08:01.790
How are you, now?

01:08:02.362 --> 01:08:03.263
You were away for a walk.

01:08:04.493 --> 01:08:05.733
Even though, it's a big house...

01:08:06.439 --> 01:08:08.218
sometimes I need to get out and think.

01:08:10.588 --> 01:08:11.861
Well, you do look a little tired.

01:08:14.028 --> 01:08:14.901
I feel it.

01:08:16.921 --> 01:08:17.908
Any word of Jackie?

01:08:19.064 --> 01:08:20.292
No...

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:21.170
no.

01:08:22.517 --> 01:08:23.662
I'm sorry about that.

01:08:23.982 --> 01:08:27.075
I hope that whatever #
never finds its way here.

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.718
You don't need to aplogize to me.

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:31.591
I just hope he...

01:08:31.991 --> 01:08:33.124
knows what he is doing.

01:08:37.594 --> 01:08:39.113
I know I said it before, but...

01:08:39.258 --> 01:08:41.497
if there is ever anything that
I can do to help, just ask.

01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:43.060
Your father was good to me...

01:08:43.488 --> 01:08:45.354
and I'm always willing
to help, you know that.

01:08:47.118 --> 01:08:47.731
Thank you, Tom.

01:08:49.402 --> 01:08:49.977
#

01:09:02.198 --> 01:09:03.591
I made some broth, if you'd like.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:06.805
I will.

01:09:08.254 --> 01:09:08.687
Thank you.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:18.374
#

01:09:23.644 --> 01:09:24.716
Good morning, Captain.

01:09:25.386 --> 01:09:26.648
How are you today?

01:09:27.572 --> 01:09:28.457
Most well.

01:09:28.856 --> 01:09:31.736
Tilly tells me you aspire to depart here...

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:33.620
and emabrk on a journey...

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:37.028
and that she, is to accompany you.

01:09:38.082 --> 01:09:39.682
Are these indeed your plans?

01:09:40.225 --> 01:09:41.205
That is correct.

01:09:44.666 --> 01:09:46.399
And as you are her only sister...

01:09:46.848 --> 01:09:48.529
I therefore feel honour bound,

01:09:48.612 --> 01:09:51.448
that I should ask you for her
hand, as I would, of your father.

01:09:52.733 --> 01:09:54.820
Captain, I have denied you nothing.

01:09:57.335 --> 01:09:57.915
Please sit.

01:10:04.377 --> 01:10:05.857
But I cannot...

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:09.130
# give my blessing to your request.

01:10:09.909 --> 01:10:12.617
I do not agree with this
highly irresponsible

01:10:12.684 --> 01:10:14.151
and ill concieved course of action.

01:10:14.232 --> 01:10:15.706
That is quite harsh.

01:10:16.816 --> 01:10:18.790
I have worked tirelessly
these past few months

01:10:18.851 --> 01:10:21.529
to nurse, and I might add, putting
us all to great personal risk,

01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:23.789
I did not expect you to repay it in this
fashion.

01:10:23.954 --> 01:10:25.634
In what fashion do you mean?

01:10:27.167 --> 01:10:28.740
That you would further put some risk...

01:10:29.036 --> 01:10:29.743
to my life...

01:10:29.998 --> 01:10:31.889
this innocent child's life...

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:32.307
Nay.

01:10:32.753 --> 01:10:34.080
You saved my life...

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.873
I wholly and humbly acknowledge that fact.

01:10:37.212 --> 01:10:40.265
For that, I owe you a debt,
I can never truly repay.

01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:42.288
But our feelings for each other

01:10:42.349 --> 01:10:44.383
have to be given the
respect they deserve.

01:10:53.227 --> 01:10:53.794
Captain...

01:10:54.107 --> 01:10:56.840
I do not deny the sincerity
of your feelings.

01:10:57.723 --> 01:10:59.383
But Tilly knows my
feelings on the matter.

01:11:02.178 --> 01:11:04.409
Go out of here and back to
your military post, alone,

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:06.096
if you must, but I cannot allow Tilly

01:11:06.157 --> 01:11:08.992
throw away her prospects, for
an uncertain future with you.

01:11:10.812 --> 01:11:11.772
I'm sorry, Captain.

01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:14.579
I'm sorry, Tilly.

01:11:21.417 --> 01:11:22.597
I told you James...

01:11:23.117 --> 01:11:24.911
she's stubborn and single minded.

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:26.417
We'll leave anyway.

01:11:26.811 --> 01:11:29.092
Tilly, you have to organize
a mode of transport.

01:11:29.364 --> 01:11:30.785
A motor car, a horse and cart,

01:11:30.846 --> 01:11:32.564
whatever gets us to
the nearest station.

01:11:33.099 --> 01:11:35.179
But we need to leave soon, maybe next week.

01:11:35.243 --> 01:11:36.277
And are you able to?

01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:38.133
If I can get out of this room, I'll be fine.

01:11:39.107 --> 01:11:40.513
You have to be so careful.

01:11:40.953 --> 01:11:43.338
I'll wear one of May's old dresses if I have
to.

01:11:43.417 --> 01:11:45.654
You'll dress up as my
sister to travel with me?

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:46.773
It's not a bad idea.

01:11:46.834 --> 01:11:49.014
-It's a terrible idea.
-Whatever it takes.

01:11:50.878 --> 01:11:52.298
But we need to act fast.

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:15.372
Hello, Captain.

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:18.398
How are you?

01:13:19.418 --> 01:13:20.524
I'm fine, thank you.

01:13:23.008 --> 01:13:24.241
Are you coming down with something?

01:13:34.037 --> 01:13:36.354
May, he's been coughing since
we were outside today.

01:13:37.559 --> 01:13:38.505
Outside?

01:13:39.684 --> 01:13:41.064
We took a walk around the yard.

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:42.471
Really?

01:13:43.188 --> 01:13:45.521
It did him so much good
to be outside again.

01:13:45.968 --> 01:13:46.841
Tilly, I...

01:13:50.561 --> 01:13:53.355
Captain, you've probably
caught a slight infection.

01:13:53.802 --> 01:13:54.875
Nothing serious.

01:14:25.722 --> 01:14:27.989
I'm weary in bone and spirit...

01:14:28.067 --> 01:14:31.127
and I have only one thing occupyimng my mind.

01:14:33.243 --> 01:14:34.676
It is certain. I...

01:14:34.919 --> 01:14:36.353
know it deep in my heart.

01:14:38.717 --> 01:14:40.737
I have lost Tilly to this man...

01:14:44.953 --> 01:14:47.346
and I have lost this man to Tilly.

01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:51.140
If they leave here,

01:14:51.201 --> 01:14:53.710
I am lost to both of them.

01:14:55.139 --> 01:14:56.832
But I have lost all to myself.

01:15:04.943 --> 01:15:06.370
Shall I just leave these here?

01:15:06.647 --> 01:15:07.394
Thank you, Tom.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.934
May must have forgotten to tell me
you were getting these for her.

01:15:12.146 --> 01:15:13.359
She's a little under the weather.

01:15:13.966 --> 01:15:15.392
That's right. Happy day ahead.

01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:16.738
May...

01:15:17.967 --> 01:15:18.580
Tom...

01:15:18.845 --> 01:15:21.665
I'd forgotten you were coming today.
I apologize.

01:15:22.276 --> 01:15:23.749
Thetre's no need to apologize.

01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:25.469
Is everything all right?

01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:27.369
Yes.

01:15:28.582 --> 01:15:30.036
Just caught a little chill outside.

01:15:30.975 --> 01:15:31.562
Righto!

01:15:32.412 --> 01:15:33.066
I'll be off.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.607
How much do I owe you?

01:15:37.076 --> 01:15:38.429
Don't worry about it.
We'll sort it again.

01:15:40.311 --> 01:15:41.098
Take care, now.

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:48.530
Tilly...

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:53.237
I've been thinking, and....

01:15:55.169 --> 01:15:57.829
maybe you and the Captain should remain here
for the moment.

01:15:59.303 --> 01:16:01.383
Who knows what may happen
in the next few months...

01:16:03.978 --> 01:16:05.965
and we've both said things...

01:16:08.374 --> 01:16:09.534
I can't lose you.

01:16:11.412 --> 01:16:12.559
Not like this.

01:16:15.539 --> 01:16:16.293
May...

01:16:18.447 --> 01:16:19.147
thank you.

01:16:22.732 --> 01:16:24.952
I know you are concerned
for my well being...

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:27.921
but James and I have made our plan.

01:16:29.457 --> 01:16:31.370
We will depart in a matter of days.

01:16:34.431 --> 01:16:37.511
I fear if we leave it too long,
his spirits will drop no end.

01:16:41.871 --> 01:16:42.657
Thank you.

01:16:45.254 --> 01:16:46.294
Thank you for everything.

01:17:14.107 --> 01:17:17.047
#

01:17:17.473 --> 01:17:19.827
#

01:17:20.009 --> 01:17:21.775
#

01:17:24.251 --> 01:17:25.624
Sorry to intrude, but...

01:17:26.843 --> 01:17:29.717
I've become an exponent of
drinking alone, these nights...

01:17:31.338 --> 01:17:32.984
and this has made me share it.

01:17:33.773 --> 01:17:34.473
Don't be silly.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:35.817
Of course.

01:17:36.487 --> 01:17:37.707
We'll definitely share it.

01:17:39.004 --> 01:17:39.791
Please, Tilly...

01:17:40.207 --> 01:17:40.787
continue.

01:17:43.418 --> 01:17:44.078
#

01:17:44.476 --> 01:17:46.116
#

01:17:46.529 --> 01:17:49.123
#

01:17:49.549 --> 01:17:50.249
#

01:17:50.562 --> 01:17:54.482
#

01:17:58.965 --> 01:18:01.591
#

01:18:02.357 --> 01:18:03.550
#

01:18:03.742 --> 01:18:05.009
#

01:18:05.299 --> 01:18:09.025
#

01:18:09.802 --> 01:18:11.689
#

01:18:12.819 --> 01:18:13.819
#

01:18:14.324 --> 01:18:15.804
#

01:18:26.882 --> 01:18:27.515
Thank you.

01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:36.143
I say we drink..

01:18:37.447 --> 01:18:38.247
Hear! Hear!

01:19:25.134 --> 01:19:26.221
It's hi!

01:19:28.179 --> 01:19:28.852
It's him!

01:19:51.223 --> 01:19:51.870
James?

01:19:58.578 --> 01:19:59.451
James!

01:19:59.832 --> 01:20:00.439
James!

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:01.510
Oh God!

01:20:02.554 --> 01:20:03.534
James!

01:20:04.142 --> 01:20:05.815
#

01:20:06.682 --> 01:20:07.862
James is gone.

01:20:08.801 --> 01:20:09.681
He's gone from me.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.533
I was her by his side. I
slept here all night.

01:20:15.171 --> 01:20:16.097
Dear God, No!

01:20:18.653 --> 01:20:21.480
#

01:20:23.714 --> 01:20:25.847
#

01:20:25.908 --> 01:20:26.920
Have you lost your mind?

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.388
You know full well that no doctor
can be called to this house...

01:20:29.449 --> 01:20:31.310
or anyone else in this matter. There is no
one else.

01:20:31.954 --> 01:20:32.461
Tilly...

01:20:33.801 --> 01:20:36.401
even if a Dr. Devlin was here,
there's nothing he could do.

01:20:36.938 --> 01:20:38.245
It's too late for #

01:20:47.177 --> 01:20:48.505
Tell me , please.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.850
He can't go...

01:21:05.619 --> 01:21:08.048
May God have mercy on us all.

01:21:55.026 --> 01:21:55.698
Tilly?

01:21:59.852 --> 01:22:00.836
It's time.

01:22:02.938 --> 01:22:04.399
Leave us for one moment.

01:22:26.487 --> 01:22:27.729
Do you want to say a prayer?

01:22:41.914 --> 01:22:43.211
Rest in peace.

01:22:44.532 --> 01:22:45.475
Captain Shearing.

01:23:21.855 --> 01:23:23.324
Can I get you something to eat?

01:23:46.579 --> 01:23:49.015
Oh! And some sugar too, please.

01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:16.893
Tilly!

01:24:20.346 --> 01:24:21.010
Tilly!

01:24:22.177 --> 01:24:23.794
Trying to catch pneumonia?

01:24:25.376 --> 01:24:26.446
You'll catch your death!

01:24:45.408 --> 01:24:47.065
It feels there's a spring in the air.

01:24:47.905 --> 01:24:49.970
#

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:55.639
I'm pregnant, May.

01:24:57.463 --> 01:24:58.494
I'm with child.

01:25:01.992 --> 01:25:03.390
I've known for a few weeks now.

01:25:13.777 --> 01:25:14.886
I don't know...

01:25:15.463 --> 01:25:16.330
what to say.

01:25:21.565 --> 01:25:23.713
Are you certain? How can you know for sure?

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:24.766
Of course, I know.

01:25:25.654 --> 01:25:27.756
My body has informed me of my condition.

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:32.442
James died not knowing he was to be a father.

01:25:36.443 --> 01:25:36.943
When?

01:25:38.517 --> 01:25:39.251
How long?

01:25:43.603 --> 01:25:45.509
The birth will be sometime in mid-October.

01:26:11.476 --> 01:26:12.351
He never knew.

01:26:17.052 --> 01:26:18.935
You do know that this baby...

01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:21.441
cannot be born here at Gleep House.

01:26:24.947 --> 01:26:27.759
Apart from the scandal that would
ensue from such a revelation,

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:29.789
there would reamin the mystery
of the child's father.

01:26:31.727 --> 01:26:34.789
And you know what arises
from such speculation.

01:26:42.473 --> 01:26:44.621
It was fated that this is
how it would be for us.

01:26:53.353 --> 01:26:55.525
I will write to George and Winny at London.

01:26:56.681 --> 01:26:58.712
George is a second cousin
on Mother's side and...

01:27:00.307 --> 01:27:01.143
they're good people.

01:27:02.531 --> 01:27:04.289
Untroubled by wagging tongues.

01:27:08.889 --> 01:27:09.701
Then you both...

01:27:10.076 --> 01:27:10.975
can return home.

01:27:16.079 --> 01:27:17.641
Will you care for his grave while I'm gone?

01:27:18.905 --> 01:27:20.241
Tend to the flowers I've sown?

01:27:24.019 --> 01:27:24.926
You have my word.

01:27:42.815 --> 01:27:45.596
Less than two weeks from writing
the letter, I recieved news.

01:27:46.923 --> 01:27:48.740
George and Winny would
be more than delighted

01:27:48.801 --> 01:27:50.358
to have Tilly in their Highgate home.

01:27:52.941 --> 01:27:54.707
My general muse this morning is...

01:27:55.519 --> 01:27:56.363
#

01:27:57.124 --> 01:27:58.647
Dark... bleak...

01:28:00.714 --> 01:28:02.027
I know that from this day...

01:28:02.871 --> 01:28:05.223
the 8th of April, 1921...

01:28:06.609 --> 01:28:08.609
nothing will ever be quite
the same here again.

01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:14.876
You look rested.

01:28:16.196 --> 01:28:17.243
Ready for your journey?

01:28:19.081 --> 01:28:20.128
Eat well.

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:23.723
It will sustain you for the long day ahead.

01:28:39.278 --> 01:28:40.012
Tilly.

01:28:53.846 --> 01:28:54.409
Tilly.

01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:57.133
It's time.

01:29:21.636 --> 01:29:22.472
Get up!

01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:25.693
Get up!

01:29:34.548 --> 01:29:35.712
Don't look at me.

01:29:49.898 --> 01:29:50.601
Down!

01:29:57.737 --> 01:29:58.268
#

01:29:59.826 --> 01:30:00.444
Right.

01:30:22.527 --> 01:30:23.520
Turn around and go back.

01:30:25.407 --> 01:30:27.306
We can't do that. We have to go through.

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:30.337
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

01:30:30.608 --> 01:30:31.311
Turn around.

01:30:31.935 --> 01:30:34.412
We have to go on. We must
catch a train to Dublin.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:00.774
You're from that big house, right?

01:31:01.853 --> 01:31:02.470
Yes.

01:31:03.190 --> 01:31:03.971
Gleep House.

01:31:06.931 --> 01:31:07.400
Alright.

01:31:08.284 --> 01:31:09.041
Let them through.

01:31:14.664 --> 01:31:15.305
May!

01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:16.324
Jackie!

01:31:18.878 --> 01:31:20.583
-Bring him over here!
-#

01:31:27.354 --> 01:31:28.370
Know these women, do ya?

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.126
I said...

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.217
-Do you know these women?
-I work for them.

01:31:33.374 --> 01:31:33.881
So...

01:31:35.108 --> 01:31:37.302
you employ IRA scum on your farm?

01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:39.505
I know him from the village.

01:31:41.006 --> 01:31:42.436
But he does not work for me.

01:31:43.299 --> 01:31:45.080
Nor has he ever set foot in Gleep House.

01:31:50.888 --> 01:31:51.638
Should I say...

01:31:52.498 --> 01:31:53.595
you know, it makes me laugh.

01:31:54.277 --> 01:31:55.636
The choices we make in combat..

01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:57.895
one side or the other...

01:31:58.651 --> 01:31:59.464
but never both.

01:32:01.478 --> 01:32:02.267
Clear the road.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.624
Tilly.

01:32:18.183 --> 01:32:20.386
May! Please don't!
We need to go back! May!

01:32:25.035 --> 01:32:25.816
Next one.

01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:27.176
#

01:32:31.278 --> 01:32:32.442
We have to go on.

01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:34.498
Walk on.

01:32:35.134 --> 01:32:35.696
Walk.

01:33:32.631 --> 01:33:34.170
How's Miss Tilly getting on in London?

01:33:35.753 --> 01:33:36.862
I think she likes it.

01:33:37.905 --> 01:33:39.507
Any change is as good as a rest, so they say.

01:33:40.649 --> 01:33:41.931
#

01:33:45.690 --> 01:33:46.198
Tom.

01:33:48.192 --> 01:33:50.098
I'm sorry, I couldn't go to Jackie's funeral.

01:33:51.284 --> 01:33:52.995
I was in a bad place until he left.

01:33:53.934 --> 01:33:54.965
Please, Miss May...

01:33:55.890 --> 01:33:57.218
we all have our troubles.

01:33:59.356 --> 01:34:00.559
How are you coping?

01:34:06.984 --> 01:34:09.038
I suppose we're like a large
family, that's really it...

01:34:10.967 --> 01:34:11.983
That's not right, you know?

01:34:13.086 --> 01:34:14.141
I have to bury a son.

01:34:30.306 --> 01:34:32.267
And she's getting along well. She is.

01:34:32.383 --> 01:34:33.944
Yes. We have thousands over there.

01:34:34.424 --> 01:34:35.445
Have you heard the news?

01:34:35.695 --> 01:34:36.977
They're after calling a truce.

01:34:37.193 --> 01:34:38.631
The war. It's over!

01:34:40.512 --> 01:34:41.481
What's news?

01:34:41.659 --> 01:34:42.761
What's going on here?

01:34:42.944 --> 01:34:43.777
A deal!

01:34:43.967 --> 01:34:45.959
A general truce between the IRA and....

01:34:46.179 --> 01:34:47.664
the forces of the English government.

01:34:47.725 --> 01:34:49.800
-It's just terrific.
-When did this happen?

01:34:49.861 --> 01:34:51.621
Just yesterday in Dublin, I think

01:34:52.198 --> 01:34:53.591
Mr. # has announced...

01:34:53.693 --> 01:34:56.440
that he will travel to London to meet with
Lord George.

01:34:56.575 --> 01:34:57.822
So it is over?

01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:00.110
Thank God if this is true.

01:35:00.171 --> 01:35:03.505
Of course, it is true. Mrs. Galvin
heard it in Dublin yesterday.

01:35:04.071 --> 01:35:06.498
New beginning, my dear. New beginning.

01:35:12.769 --> 01:35:15.509
The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed in London.

01:35:16.531 --> 01:35:18.835
Our country will now become a dominion

01:35:18.896 --> 01:35:20.077
within the British empire...

01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:23.282
kown as the Irish Free State.

01:35:25.330 --> 01:35:26.590
Everything is changing.

01:35:27.959 --> 01:35:30.893
But nothing will change
how lost I've become.

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:47.005
How can you tell, Jack, the
letter is good or bad?

01:35:47.158 --> 01:35:48.838
A simple deduction.

01:35:49.211 --> 01:35:52.018
I only have to look at the writing on the
envelope to tell.

01:35:53.029 --> 01:35:53.736
Thank you.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.266
Good news, Miss May?

01:36:02.959 --> 01:36:03.686
Yes, Jack.

01:36:04.813 --> 01:36:05.866
Wonderful news.

01:36:10.017 --> 01:36:13.223
Dear sister Tilly has been
delivered of a baby boy.

01:36:13.963 --> 01:36:15.816
A child to Miss Tilly?

01:36:16.499 --> 01:36:17.232
I never...

01:36:18.286 --> 01:36:19.552
Well, praise be...

01:36:19.985 --> 01:36:21.339
Conratulations!

01:36:21.801 --> 01:36:24.411
Any day we get good news is a good day.

01:36:28.126 --> 01:36:29.873
Has the child been given a name?

01:36:32.432 --> 01:36:33.025
James.

01:37:04.315 --> 01:37:06.528
Oh, Tilly # at last

01:37:09.364 --> 01:37:11.584
You are so... welcome home.

01:37:12.464 --> 01:37:13.191
Oh, May!

01:37:19.493 --> 01:37:20.566
This is your nephew.

01:37:21.529 --> 01:37:24.282
James... Anthony Collingwood.

01:37:27.230 --> 01:37:28.604
Hello!

01:37:33.012 --> 01:37:34.492
Nothing has changed here, May.

01:37:53.094 --> 01:37:54.627
How do you find her, doctor?

01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:59.351
I know this should be a joyous home coming
May...

01:38:00.744 --> 01:38:02.538
but treasure what time is left.

01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:08.357
Thak you.

01:38:24.859 --> 01:38:26.246
Welcome home, Miss Tilly.

01:38:27.818 --> 01:38:29.485
I want you to have
this for the wee lad.

01:38:30.155 --> 01:38:31.435
It's Jackies , you know.

01:38:33.446 --> 01:38:36.126
Twenty odd years ago, I made
this with my own hands.

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.449
Oh, he's a handsome fellow.

01:38:46.154 --> 01:38:47.201
Thank you, Tom.

01:39:08.947 --> 01:39:09.701
Thank you, May.

01:39:12.086 --> 01:39:13.506
Can I get you anything else?

01:39:14.197 --> 01:39:16.024
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

01:39:22.743 --> 01:39:23.890
How is James?

01:39:25.927 --> 01:39:26.920
He's sleeping.

01:39:30.711 --> 01:39:32.384
It was very kind of Tom to bring...

01:39:34.728 --> 01:39:36.361
Did you speak to him
about the day I left?

01:39:37.813 --> 01:39:38.906
Of course, not.

01:39:40.414 --> 01:39:41.300
How could I?

01:39:43.355 --> 01:39:44.346
You regret...

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.780
what happened that day?

01:39:46.371 --> 01:39:47.473
How we denied him?

01:39:51.523 --> 01:39:53.423
I have many regrets...

01:39:55.804 --> 01:39:56.938
more than you will ever know.

01:39:58.858 --> 01:40:00.507
But sometimes the situation...

01:40:00.568 --> 01:40:03.234
one finds oneself in leads to a...

01:40:04.759 --> 01:40:06.402
necessary course of action

01:40:09.885 --> 01:40:10.987
Do you think we could've saved him?

01:40:13.538 --> 01:40:14.821
Perhaps this isn't such a good idea.

01:40:14.882 --> 01:40:15.914
Maybe we should be indoors.

01:40:15.975 --> 01:40:16.513
May...

01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:19.209
Dr. Devlin told me...

01:40:21.833 --> 01:40:22.841
I know my fate.

01:40:26.026 --> 01:40:27.292
Let's just sit here.

01:40:31.244 --> 01:40:32.165
Let me be.

01:40:57.175 --> 01:40:57.777
May...

01:40:59.637 --> 01:41:01.263
#

01:41:02.943 --> 01:41:04.287
I can do the necessary here.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.102
I don't know what to say.

01:42:07.312 --> 01:42:07.921
Adopt?

01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:14.202
Please don't think my decision to be rash.

01:42:15.698 --> 01:42:16.737
To see,

01:42:16.798 --> 01:42:19.617
maybe James ghost in this
house, will break my heart.

01:42:21.023 --> 01:42:22.688
We can't have children of our own.

01:42:24.854 --> 01:42:25.643
Yes. I know.

01:42:44.048 --> 01:42:44.915
Farewell.

01:42:48.614 --> 01:42:49.940
My darling boy.

01:44:37.775 --> 01:44:38.572
O Lord

01:44:40.388 --> 01:44:42.371
The very words

01:44:43.787 --> 01:44:46.493
#

01:44:51.751 --> 01:44:52.551
Tilly, please...

01:44:52.879 --> 01:44:53.624
continue.

01:44:56.663 --> 01:45:00.483
#

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:07.724
#

01:45:08.347 --> 01:45:11.047
#

01:45:11.277 --> 01:45:14.917
#

01:45:15.839 --> 01:45:17.819
#

01:45:18.714 --> 01:45:19.941
#

01:45:20.284 --> 01:45:21.871
#

01:45:26.504 --> 01:45:27.230
I say we drink.

01:45:27.702 --> 01:45:28.483
You're here.

01:45:38.934 --> 01:45:41.379
I cannot undo the wrongs I've caused.

01:45:42.604 --> 01:45:45.138
And it is a weight that I cannot bear

01:45:45.199 --> 01:45:46.872
with me till my final judgement.

01:45:48.603 --> 01:45:50.704
I am not afraid of the consequences.

01:45:51.701 --> 01:45:52.881
So please know this.

01:45:54.799 --> 01:45:55.440
The truth...

01:45:56.018 --> 01:45:57.299
is more important.

01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:42.253
A keeper of secrets.

01:46:44.366 --> 01:46:45.452
This is what I am.

01:46:47.251 --> 01:46:48.985
What I too have become...

01:46:54.016 --> 01:46:56.508
This is my final journal entry.

01:47:00.003 --> 01:47:01.097
Regretfully yours..

01:47:02.424 --> 01:47:03.026
May

01:47:03.670 --> 01:47:04.357
Collingwood
