to World War II.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.833
No black people.
- No black...

08:20.959 --> 08:22.376
I mean, there's that one scene
in Pearl Harbor.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.211
- Yeah.
- Where just...

08:24.337 --> 08:28.007
Cuba Gooding, Jr., falls out
of a kitchen all of a sudden,

08:28.133 --> 08:29.592
grabs an
anti-aircraft gun.

08:29.718 --> 08:32.553
Talk about,
"Show me the money!"

08:32.679 --> 08:34.430
What is that?

08:34.556 --> 08:35.806
- And then, apparently, white
people figured something out,

08:35.932 --> 08:37.183
because during Vietnam,

08:37.309 --> 08:38.434
they sent
all our asses over there.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.602
- Oh, yeah, Vietnam.
- Everybody.

08:39.728 --> 08:40.769
- Hello, all of my uncles.
- Yes.

08:40.896 --> 08:42.438
- Welcome to the jungle.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.648
- What is your name? Jackson?
This way to the draft.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.567
- There you go.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.028
I mean, again,
not the equality we had in mind!

08:49.154 --> 08:50.821
- Yeah. Crazy.

08:50.947 --> 08:51.989
All we wanted to do was look
at white women's asses

08:52.115 --> 08:53.157
without getting murdered.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.659
That's all
we wanted to do.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.869
- That's all.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.086
[Doorbell rings]

09:09.257 --> 09:10.507
- [German accent]
Heil Hitler.

09:10.634 --> 09:14.762
My name is colonel
Hans Mueller of the S.S.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.391
As you know, we were
combing the area for Jews.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.562
But it has come to our attention
that two negroes have escaped,

09:23.688 --> 09:27.316
and are hiding out
in this area as well.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.318
You wouldn't happen to know

09:29.444 --> 09:32.738
anything about this,
now, would you?

09:32.864 --> 09:36.825
- Uh, no.
No negroes here. Mm-mm.

09:36.952 --> 09:40.496
- Uh, negroes? Ew.
[Chuckles]

09:40.622 --> 09:41.705
Hell no.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.000
- And, um,
what are your names?

09:45.126 --> 09:46.877
- Leroy...

09:47.003 --> 09:48.504
Heimer.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.631
Leroyheimer
is my last name,

09:50.757 --> 09:53.509
and my first name
is very German,

09:53.635 --> 09:55.678
and that is because
it is Heinrich.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.556
So, my name
is Heinrich Leroyheimer.

09:59.683 --> 10:04.561
- And I am Baron Helmut...

10:04.688 --> 10:06.772
Schnitzelnazi.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.775
- Well.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.652
Are you going to
invite me in?

10:11.778 --> 10:14.071
- Of course!
- Yeah, come on in!

10:14.197 --> 10:15.948
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
absolutely.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.793
- Please, gentlemen,
sit down.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.212
Now...

10:30.338 --> 10:35.217
as you know, the negro,
not unlike the Jew,

10:35.343 --> 10:39.513
can be a very
tricky creature.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.766
Oh, that's fun.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.019
We have developed
many tests to determine

10:45.145 --> 10:48.439
if an individual
is, in fact,

10:48.565 --> 10:52.776
an actual negro.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.321
It's very scientific.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.614
Like when we throw the beans
up against the homosexuals

10:57.741 --> 10:59.700
to see if
the beans explode.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.328
- Yeah, uh...

11:02.454 --> 11:04.496
what kind of tests?

11:04.622 --> 11:07.374
- It's interesting
that you would ask me that.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.545
Would you mind if I...

11:11.671 --> 11:13.422
removed your hat?

11:13.548 --> 11:15.758
So that I can
measure your head.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.426
The negro head,
interestingly enough,

11:17.552 --> 11:20.763
only comes
in the half sizes.

11:20.889 --> 11:25.017
It's one of the many interesting
things about the negro head.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.728
Hmm.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.480
Everything
seems in order.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.939
[Both exhale]

11:31.066 --> 11:33.275
- Well,
no negro heads here.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.693
- I'll tell you what,
though.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.445
If a negro head
came in here,

11:36.571 --> 11:39.156
it would find itself
detached from its negro body.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.324
I'll tell you that,
right here.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.909
[Chuckles]
Am I right?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.660
- This is very,
very good.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.372
But there are so many
exceptions to the rule,

11:46.498 --> 11:48.832
which is why
it's so important

11:48.958 --> 11:52.711
that we have a test
which is fool-proof.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.130
- Uh, m-m-m-more tests?

11:55.256 --> 11:59.093
- You know,
hunting the negroes all day,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.887
you really build up an appetite,
do you know what I'm saying?

12:02.013 --> 12:05.391
Can I interest you two

12:05.517 --> 12:08.894
in some delicious beets?

12:09.020 --> 12:11.313
Interesting.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.565
The negro
cannot resist the beet.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.777
It is drawn to it
like flies to scheisse.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.447
Well, gentlemen.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.325
It appears I have
wasted your time.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.493
I'll be on my way.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.661
- [Exhales]

12:25.787 --> 12:27.162
- Just one more thing.

12:27.288 --> 12:31.500
I'm curious as to
how you feel about...

12:32.669 --> 12:34.795
this cat toy!

12:34.921 --> 12:37.297
Jiggledy, jiggledy!

12:37.424 --> 12:39.174
Nothing?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.551
Well, that's embarrassing.

12:40.677 --> 12:44.221
I'm sorry
for bothering you.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.223
You two are obviously
not negroes.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.558
[Both laugh]

12:47.684 --> 12:49.226
- Of course
we're not negroes.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.936
- This is a no-negro zone.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.479
- Thank you, gentlemen.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.730
- Ain't no thang.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.942
- Herr Leroyheimer.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.278
Oh, that's new.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.947
Baron Schnitzelnazi.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.699
- What's goin' on?
Oh, heil Hitler.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.076
- I'll wait for you here.
There we go. All right.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.078
By the way...
[clears throat]

13:08.204 --> 13:09.455
Are you, by chance,

13:09.581 --> 13:12.291
related to the Dusseldorf
Schnitzelnazis?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.751
- Yes, I am.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.086
- How's your Aunt Frida?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.464
- Aunt Frida? She...

13:18.590 --> 13:21.133
is still...

13:21.259 --> 13:22.634
fat?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.971
- I don't recall
her being fat.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.348
But who looks like they did
in college anyway, am I right?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.601
- Not me. Not me. Not me.
- Not this one, either.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.145
- 'Cause I was a...
You know what I'm talking about?

13:33.271 --> 13:34.771
- Well, guten tag.
- [Laughs] All right.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.399
- Oh, gutenberg!

13:37.525 --> 13:42.404
[Engine starts]

13:42.530 --> 13:43.906
[Car drives away]

13:44.032 --> 13:47.451
- Whew.
Man, that was close.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.912
Whoo. We gotta
get outta here, man.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.705
We...

13:51.831 --> 13:54.208
- He left the cat toy, man!
- Uh-uh.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.043
- He left it!
- Uh-uh.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.170
- [Laughs] Oh!

13:58.296 --> 14:00.214
Oh! [giggles]

14:05.261 --> 14:06.970
[Soul music]

14:07.096 --> 14:08.722
- So here's the thing.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.475
As black actors in Hollywood,
Jordan and I

14:11.601 --> 14:14.102
keep going out
for this one particular role

14:14.229 --> 14:15.896
over and over again.

14:16.022 --> 14:20.359
- We don't get called out
for the average black role.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.653
You know, like the gangster
who gets killed,

14:22.779 --> 14:25.030
or the pimp
who gets killed,

14:25.156 --> 14:27.533
or the black dude in Star Trek
who gets evaporated.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.201
We don't go out for those.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.911
We don't.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.496
- It's always the same role
over and over again.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.164
Tell 'em the role.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.707
- Well, maybe 'cause
we're not intimidating,

14:35.833 --> 14:37.834
but we always go out
for the black best friend.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.546
- Always, always.
Because...

14:40.672 --> 14:42.673
Always.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.049
Because you guys
understand

14:44.175 --> 14:46.176
that all groups
of three white men

14:46.302 --> 14:47.427
have to have
one black friend.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.595
- They have to.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.138
- That's a rule.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.975
- Well, he's cool,
it makes them cool.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.351
- Right, right.
- It makes them not racist.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.436
And, oh...
and the black best friend

14:56.563 --> 14:58.939
always has the same lines.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.693
I'm talking about, "Damn!"
- Mm-hmm.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.445
Or like, "No, he didn't!"
- Uh-huh.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.197
- And the ubiquitous...

15:07.323 --> 15:10.659
both: "Oh, hell no."

15:10.785 --> 15:12.411
- It's in every script
we ever see.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.745
And then, of course,
there are also

15:13.871 --> 15:15.581
phrases in every script
we always see.

15:15.707 --> 15:16.873
Here's one of 'em.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.877
"Now, ya all
clearly like each other.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.797
So go back over there
and get her digits, dog."

15:23.923 --> 15:25.257
- Mm-hmm.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.633
What about this one?
What about this one?

15:26.759 --> 15:31.054
"Man, you lucky
your pops cares about you.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.392
You lucky!"

15:35.518 --> 15:38.437
- It's ridiculous.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.231
Not every black person
is wise and reasonable.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.109
- Mm-mm, in fact,
for every Morgan Freeman,

15:44.235 --> 15:45.736
there's, like,
five Flavor Flavs.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.404
- That's true.

15:48.698 --> 15:49.781
[Onscreen voices]

15:49.907 --> 15:52.743
- [Slurps]

15:52.869 --> 15:54.870
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.038
Come on, man,
what you doin', man?

15:56.164 --> 15:57.831
That's stupid.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.250
That's stupid, man,
don't do that, man. Come on.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.877
- Are you kidding me?

16:02.003 --> 16:04.379
- Come on, man,
don't go in there!

16:04.505 --> 16:07.299
Do not go into
a crane shot right now!

16:07.425 --> 16:08.467
You kidding me?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.052
- Yeah, man, I hear y'all.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.639
This movie's got
a inconsistent visual language!

16:13.765 --> 16:15.682
- Half the time, this nigga
just shootin' all hand-held

16:15.808 --> 16:17.809
like he
a dogma filmmaker!

16:17.935 --> 16:18.977
That's funny,

16:19.103 --> 16:20.687
since dogma
clearly forbids

16:20.813 --> 16:22.439
temporal and geographical
alienation!

16:22.565 --> 16:23.815
[Sudden music strike]

16:23.941 --> 16:26.318
- Oh, I loved that shot
the first time.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.695
When it was in Nosferatu!

16:28.821 --> 16:30.238
- [Laughs]
That's right.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.698
- I mean, this nigga
tryin' to do some homage

16:31.824 --> 16:33.700
to the German expressionists
or some shit!

16:33.826 --> 16:35.494
- It's a visual
medium, man!

16:35.620 --> 16:38.830
Enough with this My Dinner
with Andre bullshit!

16:38.956 --> 16:40.624
- I mean, has this dude
even heard of mise-en-scene?

16:40.750 --> 16:43.335
Put some information
up in the frame, bitch!

16:43.461 --> 16:46.088
- Oh, I get it. Yeah.
I'ma overexpose the film.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.631
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Get an ethereal look.

16:47.757 --> 16:48.799
Man, fuck that shit!

16:48.925 --> 16:50.592
- Can we just go?

16:50.718 --> 16:53.845
- Hold on, honey, they're
actually making good points.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.139
[Onscreen voices]

16:58.059 --> 17:01.311
Hey, has this guy watched too
much Quentin Tarantino or what?

17:01.437 --> 17:03.188
- Sir, we're gonna need you
to lower your voice.

17:03.314 --> 17:07.776
Too much talking, okay?
Thank you.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.488
I talked to him, sir.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.657
He's not gonna bother you
anymore.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.368
- Thank you.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.919
- So, I am a pacifist.
I'm against violence.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.630
- Well, except... with
the exception of video games.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.382
- Yes, with the exception
of video games.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.467
- And MMA.
- Oh, yeah.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.803
- And, uh, Game of Thrones.
- Oh, yeah.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.431
- And The Wire.
- Oh, yeah!

17:37.557 --> 17:39.099
- And slasher movies.
- Uh-huh.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.434
All right, let me rephrase it.
Let me rephrase it.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.436
I am against violence
involving me.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.603
- That's... that's clear.
- No, on...

17:43.730 --> 17:45.105
yeah, on TV and movies,

17:45.231 --> 17:46.356
that's where
it's supposed to be.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.858
Where no actual person
gets hurt.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.568
- I agree with that.
I agree with that.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.319
- Which is why I will not
slap you high five anymore.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.280
- Why... why?
- Because.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.490
There's that one time.

so hard,
