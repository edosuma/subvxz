your entire operation

05:39.006 --> 05:40.505

are gonna infect

We got to get to Booner's
and warn him.

so much time with them,

05:46.613 --> 05:48.046
how come you're not infected?

or three miles south of here.

an operation up there.

- On the rebound from us.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.488

is really close,

and our transport is broken now.

your coffee these days?

23:19.632 --> 23:21.565

very good so I sat with him

- What's spousal?
- He's suggesting

24:28.968 --> 24:31.235
you're married to Devyn

24:31.237 --> 24:34.205

- Older.

Guys, you can't forget
that he gave up

Everything he's ever known.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.996
And I get that he's afraid
all the time,

No question.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.611
So would you by any chance
have encouraged him

25:13.613 --> 25:15.679
to feel this way?

25:15.681 --> 25:18.616
- No. No.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.254
A little, okay?
Nothing gets past you, does it?

25:23.256 --> 25:25.990
- And now he's in love with you.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.559
- Dana,
I'm responsible for him.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.798
I think I love him.

- Okay.
I got plenty.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.221

You go over there,

- Then you shut up

26:06.065 --> 26:07.631
and you stand there,
and he'll offer you

26:07.633 --> 26:09.233
a tour of the camp.
You say yes,

26:09.235 --> 26:12.036

that is up to you, little sis.

I have to say here?

26:21.180 --> 26:22.780

a youth detention facility

26:29.288 --> 26:30.821

I'm impressed.

have the personnel to hold it.
