00:10.162 --> 00:11.356
It sure...

00:11.522 --> 00:12.477
- Hello, Frasier.
- Niles.

00:12.642 --> 00:14.598
- Maureen.
- Hi, Niles.

00:16.762 --> 00:18.593
A, uh, nonfat cap, please.

00:18.762 --> 00:21.674
- I'll pay for his too.
- Well, thank you.

00:21.842 --> 00:24.436
My day started off with good news,
and it's already getting better.

00:24.602 --> 00:25.921
To what do I owe this largesse?

00:26.122 --> 00:27.953
Well, I'm having
a pretty great day too.

00:28.122 --> 00:30.431
See, a few months ago,
I took my first tennis lesson...

00:30.602 --> 00:33.162
And you've finally
mastered the backhand.

00:33.362 --> 00:35.239
No, I haven't played since.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.835
But the guy who was teaching me...

00:37.002 --> 00:39.118
Has won your girlish heart.

00:39.282 --> 00:40.397
No, he was a loser.

00:40.562 --> 00:43.201
But that day, he hit me this
little dink shot,

00:43.362 --> 00:45.034
and I ran for it,
and I stubbed my toe.

00:45.202 --> 00:48.512
I got this big black toenail
that lasted for, like, three months,

00:48.682 --> 00:50.320
and today it finally fell off.

00:52.522 --> 00:53.841
I can wear sandals again.

00:56.642 --> 00:58.360
- Thanks, Frasier.
- Goodbye, Maureen.

00:58.522 --> 00:59.750
- And good luck.
- Thanks.

01:01.162 --> 01:05.075
- Frasier, may I borrow your spoon?
- Certainly.

01:05.762 --> 01:07.718
I have an announcement.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.641
You know, frankly, so do I.

01:09.802 --> 01:12.396
Dad's girlfriend just told me
some very big news.

01:12.562 --> 01:14.314
Well, unless she's expecting
our baby brother,

01:14.482 --> 01:16.279
my news takes precedence.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.636
- She's not, is she?
- No, no.

01:20.322 --> 01:23.155
Guess who just won this year's
Mariott Fassbinder Award

01:23.322 --> 01:25.756
for Distinguished Contribution
to the Literature of Psychiatry.

01:25.922 --> 01:28.231
Judging from the canary feathers
protruding from your mouth,

01:28.402 --> 01:29.517
- I'd say you.
- Yes.

01:30.482 --> 01:31.631
What article did you win for?

01:31.802 --> 01:34.521
A gripping case history
of a narcissistic opera singer.

01:34.682 --> 01:36.832
I called it, "Me Me Me Me Me."

01:37.002 --> 01:40.597
- It's very clever. I like that.
- Yes.

01:41.562 --> 01:44.713
Thrilled as I am, I must admit I'm a tad
nervous about the awards banquet.

01:44.922 --> 01:46.958
- Why?
- Dad.

01:47.162 --> 01:48.720
I want him there, of course,

01:48.882 --> 01:51.112
but I'm just dreading a rerun
of Aunt Vi's wedding.

01:51.282 --> 01:54.831
Yes, the hour he spent regaling
the table with "Little Niles" stories.

01:55.002 --> 01:56.230
Exactly.

01:56.402 --> 01:58.358
Imagine an entire roomful
of trained psychiatrists

01:58.522 --> 02:02.276
hearing the story of Sheldon,
my imaginary protëgë.

02:03.122 --> 02:04.271
Oh, yes, Sheldon.

02:04.442 --> 02:07.354
That troubled little fellow
who kept wetting your bed.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.874
Well, you know, if you're thinking
of excluding Dad from the event,

02:12.042 --> 02:13.760
your timing couldn't be worse.

02:13.922 --> 02:15.116
It's his birthday this weekend.

02:15.322 --> 02:16.880
Oh, right.

02:17.082 --> 02:19.073
On top of that,
Maureen just told me

02:19.242 --> 02:21.153
that she's decided
to break it off with him.

02:21.322 --> 02:22.755
- No.
- Yes.

02:22.922 --> 02:25.356
Oh, dear. What?

02:25.522 --> 02:26.637
Is it the age difference?

02:26.802 --> 02:28.599
No, no, she was quite emphatic
on that point.

02:28.762 --> 02:30.514
She just thinks they have
nothing in common.

02:30.682 --> 02:33.321
Oh, poor Dad. I know how much
he enjoyed going out with her.

02:33.482 --> 02:34.915
Yes, just the other day
he was saying

02:35.082 --> 02:37.198
that between her police badge
and his handicap sticker,

02:37.362 --> 02:39.080
they could park anywhere.

02:44.682 --> 02:45.797
Evening, Dr Crane.

02:45.962 --> 02:48.681
Daphne, thank God you're home first.
Listen, I have to warn you.

02:48.842 --> 02:51.037
- About what?
- Dad and Maureen are on a date.

02:51.202 --> 02:54.000
It's not going well. She's telling him
that she wants to break it off.

02:54.162 --> 02:56.232
Oh, this vision you're getting,

02:56.442 --> 02:58.637
is it a tingly feeling
and a picture in your head,

02:58.802 --> 03:01.999
or more like a husky voice
murmuring in your ear?

03:02.162 --> 03:03.800
It's not a vision.

03:04.362 --> 03:06.273
Maureen told me about this
this afternoon.

03:06.442 --> 03:08.876
Just worried about Dad.
We have to help him through this.

03:09.442 --> 03:11.080
I wouldn't worry about your father.

People are more resilient
than you think.

03:13.642 --> 03:15.712
You know, when Joe dumped me
a few weeks ago,

03:15.882 --> 03:17.634
I thought I'd lost the love of me life.

03:17.802 --> 03:21.477
I figured I'd spend the rest of my years
dwelling on what might have been.

03:21.642 --> 03:24.475
The home we'd have made,
the children running through it,

03:24.642 --> 03:27.031
growing old together.

03:27.322 --> 03:29.882
Did I mention Joe's getting married?

03:30.322 --> 03:32.961
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm all right.

03:41.962 --> 03:43.680
That'll be fine.

03:47.122 --> 03:48.919
I should've known
that you'd hate Indian food.

03:49.082 --> 03:52.438
No, it was great. I just... You know,
it just takes a little getting used to.

03:52.602 --> 03:54.593
Yeah, it does.
You should try it again sometime.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.432
I think I just did.

03:58.842 --> 04:01.834
So are you gonna come in
for some coffee?

04:02.202 --> 04:05.080
No, you're not feeling too well.

04:05.242 --> 04:06.721
I think I'll just call it a night.

04:06.882 --> 04:09.350
I thought you said there was
something you wanted to talk about.

04:10.082 --> 04:11.310
It can wait.

04:11.642 --> 04:14.236
- Good night.
- Good night.

- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

04:18.002 --> 04:18.991
How was your date?

04:19.161 --> 04:21.551
Awful. I never felt this bad
in my life.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.673
- Oh, Dad.
- Yeah.

04:23.842 --> 04:26.675
I feel like my guts
have been ripped out.

04:27.522 --> 04:30.559
Dad, let me assure you
this has nothing to do with your age.

04:30.722 --> 04:33.998
The hell it doesn't. This never would've
happened 20 years ago.

04:36.682 --> 04:39.242
Well, you know, Dad,
I may be talking out of turn here,

04:39.402 --> 04:40.994
but Maureen told me about this.

04:41.162 --> 04:42.720
- What?
- Yes.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.361
Yes, she came to me for advice.

04:44.522 --> 04:46.319
That's how determined she was
not to hurt you.

04:46.482 --> 04:47.471
You see...

04:47.642 --> 04:49.155
...she wanted to make it
perfectly clear

04:49.322 --> 04:51.711
that her breaking up with you
had nothing to do with your age,

04:51.882 --> 04:53.156
but, rather, your compatibility.

that you don't like the same food,
music or movies...

04:57.002 --> 04:59.197

did she?

05:00.522 --> 05:02.240
- No.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

- She doesn't want to see me again?
- I know. I feel so terrible.

Listen, Dad, I know exactly how
you're feeling right now.

met at McGinty's.

10:20.042 --> 10:21.521
That's right. I tend bar there.

10:21.682 --> 10:24.480
Saw your dad there one night
looking kind of lonesome,

10:24.642 --> 10:27.076
- and I said to myself...
- Bottoms up.

10:28.842 --> 10:30.116
Well, something like that.

10:30.282 --> 10:32.352
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

10:34.482 --> 10:36.234
- Yes.
- Through the lips and over the gums...

10:36.402 --> 10:38.279
Look out taste buds, here it comes.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.201
I never heard that version.

of that, I'd be dancing on the table.

10:58.762 --> 11:01.151
Yeah, you know,
Sherry used to be on stage.

11:01.322 --> 11:02.596
On Broadway?

11:02.762 --> 11:04.275
Las Vegas. Ever been there?

11:04.442 --> 11:06.273
Just once.

11:06.962 --> 11:10.272
What a town, huh?
Great food, terrific theatre.

"Honey, the only way to get over
someone is to get under someone."

11:31.802 --> 11:32.917

of sayings like that.

No.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.758
- Party on.
- All right.

20:24.682 --> 20:27.879
Well, I think we should go
and unwrap this.

20:28.442 --> 20:31.115
Oh, Dad, Lilith mentioned that she was
gonna be joining Frederick

20:31.282 --> 20:33.591
on his next visit. You don't mind
if she stays here, do you?

20:33.762 --> 20:36.674
Oh, Lilith? No. Great. I love Lilith.

20:36.842 --> 20:39.595
MARTIN: That's terrific.
No, she's welcome here anytime.

20:39.922 --> 20:42.516
Honey, you're hurting my hand.

20:45.882 --> 20:49.079
Oh, listen, I should mention,
I'm kind of a sleepwalker.

20:49.242 --> 20:51.802
So if you get up in the night,
and find me in here naked,

20:51.962 --> 20:54.954
just give me a good hard shake.
I'll come to in a jiff.

20:56.402 --> 20:57.551
Ha! Ha-ha!

20:58.162 --> 20:59.720
Got me. Good one.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.671
That was great.

21:07.842 --> 21:11.073
- You really got them good.
- I know.
