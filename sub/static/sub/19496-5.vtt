I didn't do it.
She's lying.

01:24.290 --> 01:26.329
WOMAN:
Well, we still need to answer
the subpoena, Mr. Weller, so...

01:26.330 --> 01:28.749
Yeah, well, I have the answer:
go to hell.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.039
I didn't rape anyone,
I didn't molest anyone.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.999
It just makes me sick.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.249
It's this campaign, they think
they can say anything about me

01:35.250 --> 01:37.329
and make it stick.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.619
So, what, are we
the anti-Trump firm now?

01:40.620 --> 01:42.419
That's not what this is about;
that's a First Amendment issue.

01:42.420 --> 01:43.959
How is it a
First Amendment issue?

01:43.960 --> 01:47.289
We're talking about
a-a TV network,

01:47.290 --> 01:49.249
not the U.S. government; that
is not a First Amendment issue.

01:49.250 --> 01:51.999
Julius, the Trump administration
is pressuring the TV network;

01:52.000 --> 01:53.669
that makes it a First
Amendment issue, Julius.

01:53.670 --> 01:54.999
How are they pressuring
the TV networks?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.459
We're talking about a network

01:56.460 --> 01:58.459
that shot an episode
and chose not to air it.

01:58.460 --> 01:59.879
Simple matter of the fact,
you voted for the man.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.249
That's what this is about.
Oh, there it is!
There he is.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.499
The black man
who voted for Trump.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.669
Whoa!
You voted for him, not me.

02:04.670 --> 02:07.249
Wait, gentlemen, please,

02:07.250 --> 02:08.619
the only question before us

02:08.620 --> 02:09.919
is whether we take this case.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.459
DIANE:
Uh, I'm sorry.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.539
What is the case?
A writer I know

02:13.540 --> 02:16.249
is one of those Chicago shows.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.289
He wrote a
ripped-from-the-headline

02:17.290 --> 02:19.249
episode about Donald Trump.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.079
A fictional Trump.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.879
It's based on the accusation

02:22.880 --> 02:24.919
that he raped a 13-year-old.
JULIUS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

02:24.920 --> 02:26.379
there was no accusation.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.419
The lawsuit was dropped,
and the accuser

02:28.420 --> 02:29.709
never even let
her name go public.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.289
Because she didn't want to go up
against the president.

02:31.290 --> 02:32.959
This is the same president
that said...

02:32.960 --> 02:33.960
Have you listened
to anything the man said...

02:33.961 --> 02:35.249
Oh, if it was Obama or Clinton,

02:35.250 --> 02:36.919
you would have been fine
with that.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.289
Can we please stay on topic?

02:38.290 --> 02:39.419
Anti-disabled people,
anti-women.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.079
The network delayed
the broadcast,

02:42.080 --> 02:43.879
so the writer put it online.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.039
And the network
is suing for theft?

02:46.040 --> 02:48.169
Yes, for $12 million.
Ooh.

02:48.170 --> 02:49.289
He was afraid

02:49.290 --> 02:50.669
they weren't going
to show the episode

02:50.670 --> 02:52.169
due to the fear
of the president.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.669
He's lost his lawyer,

02:53.670 --> 02:56.459
so he's asking us
to represent him.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.829
Hello! This is not
about politics.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.539
I know that, tell him.
What's your strategy?

03:01.540 --> 03:04.379
You can't argue against the
theft. He's proud of his crime.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.379
He brags about it.
I'm not saying we
should argue against theft.

03:06.380 --> 03:08.829
Julius, Julius,

03:08.830 --> 03:10.619
I'm saying we should use
the whistleblower laws.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.379
Huh?
Mm-mm, Adrian, he was not fired.

03:13.380 --> 03:15.709
Exactly, he wasn't
fired, Adrian.

03:15.710 --> 03:17.249
What's your legal strategy?

03:17.250 --> 03:19.579
If we take this case,
you need to argue something.

03:19.580 --> 03:20.920
Try fair use.

03:22.210 --> 03:24.209
In what way, Diane?

03:24.210 --> 03:26.329
Copyright material

03:26.330 --> 03:28.419
may be quoted verbatim for
purposes such as criticism.

03:28.420 --> 03:30.329
That's criticism.

03:30.330 --> 03:32.499
Our client is quoting the work

03:32.500 --> 03:34.289
to show the chilling
effect on his network.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.789
ADRIAN:
People,

03:35.790 --> 03:37.420
it's good. It's good.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.960
Adrian, do you have a minute?

03:43.210 --> 03:45.120
Okay, why are we doing this?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.209
Chicago TV production.

03:50.210 --> 03:51.749
It's blowing up, Barbara.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.919
And there'll be even more
tax breaks next year.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.539
You want to expand
into entertainment.
I want to put us on the map

03:56.540 --> 03:58.539
more strongly as a Chicago firm

03:58.540 --> 04:00.379
that handles local cases.

04:00.380 --> 04:03.419
Then why isn't it a mistake
to go up against the studios,

04:03.420 --> 04:05.579
especially on a case
we're gonna lose?

04:05.580 --> 04:07.289
It's an audition.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.249
We show their lawyers we can
give them a run for their money.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.249
My guess,

04:11.250 --> 04:13.289
they'd much rather have us
inside the tent pissing out

04:13.290 --> 04:15.829
than outside the tent
pissing in.

04:15.830 --> 04:18.249
Oh, we need to talk
to Diane today.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.999
Hey, can that wait a week?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.079
Not if we want to be consistent.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.619
We've always insisted
that equity partners

04:23.620 --> 04:26.249
have the capital contribution
within a month.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.669
Okay, I need you to do it.

04:27.670 --> 04:29.709
Well, how come I always have
to do all the dirty work,

04:29.710 --> 04:31.289
and you get to go
and have fun in court?

04:31.290 --> 04:33.329
'Cause you're so good
at the dirty work.

04:33.330 --> 04:34.619
I hate when you disguise curses

04:34.620 --> 04:35.919
as compliments.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.709
(sucks in through teeth)

04:37.710 --> 04:40.419
I'm going to court.
Mm-hmm.

04:40.420 --> 04:41.460
(elevator bell dings)

04:45.920 --> 04:47.380
Maia Rindell, please.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.329
This article is
completely false.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.039
It is untrue.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.329
So you bought the jewelry before
your parents' Ponzi scheme?

04:58.330 --> 04:59.419
No.

04:59.420 --> 05:01.039
I never bought the jewelry.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.419
Was it a... gift?

05:02.420 --> 05:03.499
No.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.959
There is no jewelry.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.289
This article is false.
It quotes witnesses.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.879
Here it says,

05:08.880 --> 05:10.919
the owner of Madame
Rudolph's Antique Jewelry

05:10.920 --> 05:12.079
said they sold you

05:12.080 --> 05:13.379
ten pieces?

05:13.380 --> 05:14.669
And that is made up.

05:14.670 --> 05:16.379
Did you try calling the store?

05:16.380 --> 05:17.879
So you're saying there
is no Dolly Rudolph,

05:17.880 --> 05:20.289
proprietor of Madame
Rudolph's Antique Jewelry?

05:20.290 --> 05:22.249
Oh, I'm saying there might be
a Dolly Rudolph,

05:22.250 --> 05:23.879
but I have never met her,

05:23.880 --> 05:26.709
and I've never bought
any jewelry from her.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.579
Huh.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.289
Did you try calling the store?

05:30.290 --> 05:33.789
I just don't understand how this
article could get so much wrong.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.379
YESHA:
What she's saying is

05:35.380 --> 05:37.999
the article's a part of
this trend in fake news.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.669
It makes up stories
to encourage clickbait.

05:40.670 --> 05:45.079
Yes, but this isn't
the only article.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.499
Here.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.959
These are 12
different Web sites,

05:48.960 --> 05:50.499
a lot of them
well-respected,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.419
all saying that you did

05:52.420 --> 05:54.419
the exact same thing.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.879
So how do you account for that?

05:55.880 --> 05:57.419
I think the fake news was

05:57.420 --> 05:59.209
picked up by other Web sites

05:59.210 --> 06:01.289
as if it were real.
And why would they do that?

06:01.290 --> 06:04.379
Because the story is fun.

06:04.380 --> 06:06.419
It has a clear villain... me.

06:06.420 --> 06:08.999
Oh, I don't know,
Ms. Rindell.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.249
I don't think there's
anything fun about this story.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.459
Did you try calling the store?

06:14.460 --> 06:15.539
What about this article

06:15.540 --> 06:17.669
about you visiting your father

06:17.670 --> 06:18.999
while he was awaiting trial?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.419
What did you guys talk about?

06:20.420 --> 06:22.379
YESHA:
That was a personal visit.

06:22.380 --> 06:25.249
I was there as well as
Mr. Rindell's attorney, so...

06:25.250 --> 06:26.619
No, no, not that visit.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.249
I'm talking about
the other two visits,

06:29.250 --> 06:31.999
when Maia went by herself.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.080
That's more fake news.
There were no other visits.
Yesha.

06:37.420 --> 06:40.459
At this point,

06:40.460 --> 06:42.789
we'll interrupt the questioning

06:42.790 --> 06:44.080
so Maia and I can discuss.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.000
Sure.

06:49.790 --> 06:53.039
Why don't you
figure out which is

06:53.040 --> 06:54.879
fake news

06:54.880 --> 06:57.170
and which is not.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.460
(chuckles)

07:04.670 --> 07:05.959
What's wrong?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.419
What?

07:07.420 --> 07:08.749
Uh, nothing, why?

07:08.750 --> 07:10.709
You just have a look.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.539
Mrs. Kolstad wants to see you
now. Are we in trouble?

07:12.540 --> 07:15.039
What? No.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.459
Because I need this job.

07:16.460 --> 07:19.079
Oh, I'll keep that in mind.

07:19.080 --> 07:23.419
We've had to make
a difficult decision here.

07:23.420 --> 07:24.919
Uh-oh.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.919
What?

07:26.920 --> 07:29.379
Well, that's what we tell
associates when we release them.

07:29.380 --> 07:30.459
(chuckles)

07:30.460 --> 07:32.290
Well, it's not quite that.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.289
The capital contribution.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.329
Oh.
Yes, we know
you're having trouble

07:38.330 --> 07:40.459
releasing it from your old firm.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.249
But we need to insist.

07:42.250 --> 07:45.329
No, I understand.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.459
The partners voted.

07:47.460 --> 07:50.249
If we don't get the
contribution in a week,

07:50.250 --> 07:52.290
we'll need to make
you of counsel.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.379
(clears throat)

07:58.380 --> 07:59.460
Okay.

08:03.790 --> 08:06.749
Uh, you may want to think of
getting a lawyer for the firm.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.960
Mike Kresteva was just
questioning Maia.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.959
You went and saw
your father again?

08:19.960 --> 08:21.419
Yes.

08:21.420 --> 08:22.789
Why?

08:22.790 --> 08:24.249
He asked me

08:24.250 --> 08:26.419
to download, from my
Uncle Jax's computer,

08:26.420 --> 08:29.959
a list of clients called
the "Schtup List."

08:29.960 --> 08:31.829
"The Schtup List"?

08:31.830 --> 08:33.419
What's that?

08:33.419 --> 08:35.539
It's a list of VIP clients
in the fund

08:35.539 --> 08:37.619
that Jax did special work for.

08:37.620 --> 08:40.039
Oh, um, backdating profits
for tax purposes,

08:40.039 --> 08:41.379
transferring funds
to other accounts.

08:41.380 --> 08:43.458
Illegal activities?

08:43.460 --> 08:46.540
Mm-hmm.
And your father thought he could
use this against your uncle?

08:47.540 --> 08:49.539
Yes.

08:49.540 --> 08:51.379
So you do know, by doing this,

08:51.380 --> 08:53.419
by helping your father,

08:53.420 --> 08:55.539
you've implicated yourself
in wrongdoing?

08:55.540 --> 08:57.419
He's my father.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.289
What could I do?

08:59.290 --> 09:01.460
You can keep yourself
out of jail.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.210
Who is it, my lawyer?

09:15.500 --> 09:17.289
Mr. Rindell?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.459
Hello.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.789
I'm Mike Kresteva.

09:19.790 --> 09:22.039
Okay.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.330
Do I know you?

09:26.330 --> 09:30.789
No, but I think I can help you.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.579
Hi, Your Honor. Hi.

09:32.580 --> 09:34.419
Hello?

09:34.420 --> 09:35.499
(chuckles)
I'm Amber.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.289
Tom. Nice to meet you.

09:37.290 --> 09:38.669
Can I just say,

09:38.670 --> 09:41.619
this is a very simple
matter, Your Honor.

09:41.620 --> 09:43.289
It's stealing.

09:43.290 --> 09:45.249
It doesn't matter
if it's a stolen purse,

09:45.250 --> 09:48.709
or a stolen episode of TV, it
should be treated the same way.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.619
And yet here we are in
civil court, Your Honor,

09:50.620 --> 09:51.919
not criminal court.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.119
(chuckles)
That's a funny approach,

09:54.120 --> 09:56.209
complaining that we're not going
hard enough on your client.

09:56.210 --> 09:59.249
I'm simply pointing out
that Ms. Lutz is...
Wood.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.669
Wood Lutz.

10:00.670 --> 10:03.119
Ms. Wood Lutz...

10:03.120 --> 10:05.419
has elected not to press
criminal charges here.

10:05.420 --> 10:07.919
Something she would do if this
were a simple matter of theft.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.289
It's also true that
stolen purses

10:10.290 --> 10:11.829
don't usually cost $12 million.

10:11.830 --> 10:14.329
ADRIAN: Your Honor, the
only reason we are here

10:14.330 --> 10:16.619
is because Ms.
Wood Lutz's client

10:16.620 --> 10:18.919
has an issue in front of
the FCC, and they're afraid

10:18.920 --> 10:20.419
that the Trump administration

10:20.420 --> 10:21.879
Oh, my gosh, no.
will decide against them.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.079
I submit, Your Honor,
my client is a scapegoat.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.289
AMBER:
No, Your Honor.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.079
Can I speak, please?
Her client

10:27.080 --> 10:29.499
needs to prove themselves tough
to this administration

10:29.500 --> 10:31.669
so they'll decide in their
favor on the O&Os, Your Honor.

10:31.670 --> 10:34.879
I don't even know
what that means.
Well, actually I don't either.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.789
Owned and operated
TV stations, Your Honor.

10:36.790 --> 10:38.419
Right, so I don't understand,
are you saying

10:38.420 --> 10:40.619
that your client didn't
post the episode online?

10:40.620 --> 10:42.459
No, he did.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.289
I-I don't understand,
Your Honor.

10:44.290 --> 10:45.379
What's the defense?

10:45.380 --> 10:46.420
Fair use.

10:47.620 --> 10:49.289
GLATT:
Hmm.

10:49.290 --> 10:51.579
Okay.
(clears throat)

10:51.580 --> 10:52.879
I'm game.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.249
Let's hear it.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.079
Hi, Danny.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.829
No, no, everything's fine.

10:57.830 --> 11:02.119
It's just that thing we talked
about with my apartment.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.169
I think I want to look
for something not as grand.

11:05.170 --> 11:06.669
Diane?

11:06.670 --> 11:09.000
Someone is here to see you
and he has a present.

11:10.210 --> 11:11.879
Uh...

11:11.880 --> 11:13.380
Danny, can I call you back?

11:15.460 --> 11:17.959
Okay, good.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.249
Hi.
Hi.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.329
Do you want me to stay
and take notes?

11:21.330 --> 11:23.290
No, thank you.

11:28.540 --> 11:31.119
She's... chatty.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.709
She is that.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.169
So how are you?

11:35.170 --> 11:36.539
Good. You?

11:36.540 --> 11:38.210
Good.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.789
You called?

11:40.790 --> 11:43.499
Oh.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.999
Uh, no. When?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.330
Last night.

11:47.380 --> 11:49.499
I picked up, but you hung up.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.079
No.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.459
No, that must've been
an accidental dial.

11:53.460 --> 11:56.329
I'm a... think my phone is...

11:56.330 --> 11:58.329
(chuckles)
Anyway, I'm sorry.

11:58.330 --> 12:01.329
Well, I was gonna
call you anyway, um...

12:01.330 --> 12:03.579
I have a favor.

12:03.580 --> 12:06.669
I've agreed to give a speech on
ballistics to the police union.

12:06.670 --> 12:09.379
Really? Well, that
doesn't sound like you.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.789
Yes, it isn't.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.329
(laughs)
I was...

12:12.330 --> 12:14.999
I was hoping that
you could read it.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.619
Sure.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.039
Is tonight okay?

12:18.040 --> 12:19.999
Yes, I have to give it tomorrow.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.460
Hmm.
And...

12:22.540 --> 12:23.830
thank you.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.750
(unwrapping)

12:42.540 --> 12:43.750
Oh...

12:47.380 --> 12:49.289
ADRIAN: So, you didn't
believe the network

12:49.290 --> 12:50.419
would broadcast the episode?

12:50.420 --> 12:52.379
AMBER:
Sorry. Can I object here?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.829
Calls for
speculation.
No. Overruled.

12:54.830 --> 12:56.249
Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Fisk?

12:56.250 --> 12:58.249
FISK: They kept changing
the broadcast date.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.289
They kept pushing it back,
over and over and over again.

13:00.290 --> 13:01.709
They never expected
Trump would actually win.

13:01.710 --> 13:03.669
And then, when he did, they
wanted to bury the episode.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.959
So that's why you put
the episode online?
Yes.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.289
There's been a chilling effect

13:07.290 --> 13:08.539
at the studio and the network.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.500
They're worried about
the Donald holding grudges.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.459
Who knew network execs

13:13.460 --> 13:15.459
shit their pants over
3:00 a.m. drunk tweets?

13:15.460 --> 13:16.669
AMBER:
Objection, Your Honor.

13:16.670 --> 13:17.879
Can we not swear?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.749
Yes, we can not. Mr. Fisk.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.039
I'm sorry,
I-I found the idea that

13:22.040 --> 13:23.669
they would censor themselves
for Trump terrifying.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.249
And I wanted to point that out.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.459
ADRIAN: So you put
the episode online

13:26.460 --> 13:27.460
as a public service?

13:27.461 --> 13:28.879
GLATT: Hey, look,
let's not go overboard here.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.709
He's not Nelson Mandela.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.379
(laughs)
But I get your point.

13:32.380 --> 13:33.539
Counselor, do you have anything?

13:33.540 --> 13:35.289
Yes, uh, let's see.

13:35.290 --> 13:36.749
(pages flipping)

13:36.750 --> 13:39.079
The definition
of fair use is that

13:39.080 --> 13:41.079
"brief excerpts
of copyrightable material

13:41.080 --> 13:42.249
may be used."

13:42.250 --> 13:43.289
Brief.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.829
So,

13:44.830 --> 13:46.459
how long was that episode
that you wrote?

13:46.460 --> 13:47.420
42 minutes.

13:47.421 --> 13:49.459
And how long was the excerpt
you put online?

13:49.460 --> 13:50.749
FISK:
Because of the way

13:50.750 --> 13:51.879
I structured the episode,

13:51.880 --> 13:53.249
I needed to show
the whole thing.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.289
It was a matter of...
Okay.

13:54.290 --> 13:55.619
I know you want to talk more,

13:55.620 --> 13:57.420
but just answer the question.

13:58.460 --> 13:59.959
I put the whole thing online.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.499
It was the only way
to prove my point.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.119
AMBER: Why couldn't you
prove your point

14:03.120 --> 14:05.420
by using a small part,
a brief part?

14:07.290 --> 14:09.419
Because it required
the whole thing.

14:09.420 --> 14:10.539
All right.

14:10.540 --> 14:11.959
Nothing more, Your Honor.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.120
Redirect, Your Honor.

14:14.380 --> 14:16.919
How much did you make
by uploading the episode?

14:16.920 --> 14:18.249
How much did I make?

14:18.250 --> 14:19.829
Nothing.

14:19.830 --> 14:21.329
LUCCA: Because this
was a political move?

14:21.330 --> 14:22.959
Not an economic one?

14:22.960 --> 14:23.960
Exactly.

14:23.961 --> 14:25.579
All right.
Anything else, counselors?

14:25.580 --> 14:28.749
Yes. I have a quick
rebuttal witness.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.289
But it'll be really brief.

14:31.290 --> 14:32.959
I'm Vaughn Yenko.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.579
I am a co-executive producer
on the show.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.959
Okay, so that means
you're like a writer?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.710
No.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.249
But... yeah, mostly.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.419
AMBER:
Mr. Fisk

14:44.420 --> 14:46.379
insists that
he put his episode online

14:46.380 --> 14:47.749
as a political statement.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.289
Is that true?

14:49.290 --> 14:51.419
Objection, Your Honor.
Hearsay.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.379
AMBER: I think this is
a hearsay exception,

14:53.380 --> 14:56.039
Your Honor. Uh, prior
inconsistent statements.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.419
Yep. Overruled.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.289
S-So I should answer,
Your Honor?

15:00.290 --> 15:01.460
Oh, please.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.709
It's not true...

15:03.710 --> 15:05.249
him putting the episode online

15:05.250 --> 15:07.459
for political reasons.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.039
Fisk thought this episode
was his best work.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.999
And he thought it was
going to win him an Emmy.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.459
That's bullshit.
Oh, you think
you're God's gift.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.419
This is about you being jealous.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

15:17.420 --> 15:18.829
You stupid fucking Yale asshole.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.459
Yale is better than Princeton.
Gentlemen! Stop, stop, stop.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.039
FISK:
Yeah, Yale can wipe my ass.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.119
Gentlemen, stop it.
Yale can wipe my ass, my friend.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.419
Can wipe it.
Gentlemen, stop.

15:25.420 --> 15:26.709
Gentlemen, stop!

15:26.710 --> 15:28.789
Now, look, I hate Yale
as much as the next guy,

15:28.790 --> 15:29.999
but no one

15:30.000 --> 15:31.829
is helping their case
by arguing here.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.419
Okay, I get it.

15:34.420 --> 15:35.789
I'm sorry.

15:35.790 --> 15:37.459
Now, you're arguing

15:37.460 --> 15:39.249
that he posted online
for career,

15:39.250 --> 15:41.329
not political reasons.

15:41.330 --> 15:43.419
I am not arguing, Your Honor.
That's what the evidence proves.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.709
GLATT:
Yeah, well,

15:44.710 --> 15:47.289
the evidence
proves a lot of things.

15:47.290 --> 15:49.829
All right, here's my decision.

15:49.830 --> 15:52.579
Fair use is a joke
here, counselors.

15:52.580 --> 15:53.919
I mean,
he put the whole thing online.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.829
Now, I think the two of you

15:55.830 --> 15:57.919
should get together
and decide damages.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.119
Because, counselors, you lost.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.999
It's a loser case.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.209
Thank you, Your Honor.

16:03.210 --> 16:05.329
You could only make me
change my mind,

16:05.330 --> 16:06.959
Counselor.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.119
Bye.
(gavel bangs)

16:08.120 --> 16:10.330
(gallery murmurs)

16:16.080 --> 16:18.379
(sighs)
So I guess that's it, huh?

16:18.380 --> 16:19.499
They're gonna bankrupt me.

16:19.500 --> 16:23.499
No, that is far from it.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.380
We're just getting started.

16:27.330 --> 16:28.669
Hire me.

16:28.670 --> 16:31.119
I'll defend your firm
with my last breath.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.329
BARBARA:
Mr. Kresteva wants to

16:33.330 --> 16:36.499
tie together several accusations
against our firm.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.919
Not just our work
on police brutality cases,

16:38.920 --> 16:41.379
but also our connection
to the Rindell Fund.

16:41.380 --> 16:42.579
So we need a lawyer
for the whole firm.

16:42.580 --> 16:45.209
That's me.
ADRIAN: Okay.

16:45.210 --> 16:46.459
So how do we defend ourselves?

16:46.460 --> 16:49.709
Oh, we fight.
It's a new civil rights.

16:49.710 --> 16:54.000
And I will march with you,
my bros, until my dying breath.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.119
It's like

17:19.420 --> 17:20.669
Uh, excuse me.

17:20.670 --> 17:21.960
Yeah.

17:27.329 --> 17:29.329
Tell me you have
someone else in mind.

17:29.330 --> 17:30.959
What?

17:30.960 --> 17:33.209
Do you have
another lawyer in mind?

17:33.210 --> 17:34.959
Yes.
Who?

17:34.960 --> 17:37.210
Someone... unorthodox.

17:38.250 --> 17:39.789
How unorthodox?

17:39.790 --> 17:41.170
Do you have a minute?

17:42.580 --> 17:43.830
Yeah.

Diane Lockhart.

17:49.290 --> 17:50.329
Excuse me.

17:50.330 --> 17:51.579
DIANE:
Mr. Gross,

17:51.580 --> 17:52.619
how are you?

17:52.620 --> 17:53.669
NEIL:
Oh, you know,

17:53.670 --> 17:55.169
harried, angry, worried.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.539
Yeah, that just about
sums it up.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.669
These are my lawyers.

17:57.670 --> 17:59.459
They want to spend
my $18 billion.

17:59.460 --> 18:00.959
Hello, gentlemen.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.749
And I-I heard
you switched firms.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.289
Yes, I was thinking
about changing.

18:04.290 --> 18:06.829
An all-black firm.
Right?

18:06.830 --> 18:07.830
Reddick, Kolstad...

18:07.831 --> 18:09.119
Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.669
Right, right.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.459
So you're not
a name partner anymore.

18:12.460 --> 18:15.119
No, there's so much pressure
to keep proving...

18:15.120 --> 18:17.459
God, I hate Chicago.
But here I am.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.499
Every week, trying to bring

18:19.500 --> 18:22.079
the hog butcher
into the 21st century.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.499
(laughs) Well,
it's good to see you, Mr. Gross.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.079
Yeah.
(sniffs)

18:26.080 --> 18:28.459

with my firm.

18:28.460 --> 18:31.120
Looking for a fighter.

No, just someone who finds
good deals on offices.

18:45.960 --> 18:49.289
Is this "someone"
up to facing Kresteva?

18:49.290 --> 18:50.329
That's the hope.

I came over here one night
and Jax was here.

23:00.710 --> 23:01.879
With Mom.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.919
I know.

23:02.920 --> 23:03.920
She said.
She did?

23:03.921 --> 23:04.959
Yes, she was trying

23:04.960 --> 23:06.209
to convince Jax
to change his story,

23:06.210 --> 23:07.329
to tell the truth.

23:07.330 --> 23:08.829
Dad...
(scoffs)

23:08.830 --> 23:10.289
no, it was more than that.

23:10.290 --> 23:12.119

23:12.120 --> 23:13.419
Oh, don't worry, honey.

what Jax thinks?

23:35.880 --> 23:38.329
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

23:38.330 --> 23:40.289

23:40.290 --> 23:42.959

23:42.960 --> 23:45.669
Oh, unfurrow that brow.

23:45.670 --> 23:47.249

24:39.210 --> 24:40.749

24:40.750 --> 24:42.119
You testify in court
all the time

24:42.120 --> 24:43.789
and you make it understandable.

24:43.790 --> 24:45.329
That's an interrogatory.

24:45.330 --> 24:47.209
With a jury of 12.

24:47.210 --> 24:49.209
This is me in front
of 500 people.

24:49.210 --> 24:51.379
500?

24:51.380 --> 24:52.619
Whoa.

24:52.620 --> 24:54.499
Okay.

24:54.500 --> 24:59.999
Well, the subject
is 3D technology in ballistics.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.209
No. No, the impact
of interferometers

25:02.210 --> 25:03.459
on 3D renderings.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.169
The subject is 3D technology

25:06.170 --> 25:07.619
in ballistics.

25:07.620 --> 25:09.249
And as far as I can tell,

25:09.250 --> 25:12.329
this is about the use
of lasers to magnify

25:12.330 --> 25:14.999
imperfections
on a bullet casing, right?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.379
Yeah, using an interferometer

25:17.380 --> 25:19.079
to create what is...

25:19.080 --> 25:21.289
Right.
Right.

25:21.290 --> 25:24.209
And you can magnify a bullet
casing up to two microns?

25:24.210 --> 25:25.289
Yes.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.459
Okay, and how small is that?

25:26.460 --> 25:28.879
Just give me
a real-world example.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.709
I mean, just talk to me.
Come on, take a sip.

25:30.710 --> 25:33.459
Tell me how small
two microns are.

25:33.460 --> 25:37.619
Two microns are about 1/50

25:37.620 --> 25:39.579
of the width of a human hair.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.999
Good. You just said something
I understand, so start there.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.249
I mean, just take
a single human hair,

25:45.250 --> 25:46.669
and imagine you had a knife

25:46.670 --> 25:50.829
that could cut that hair
into 50 thin slices.

25:50.830 --> 25:53.619
What else?

25:53.620 --> 25:55.999
Did you drive here?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.499
No, a cab.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.500
Good.

25:58.501 --> 26:01.080
Drink up.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.169
This is our cost
for the episode in question,

26:07.170 --> 26:08.459
and this is our best
and final offer.

26:08.460 --> 26:10.329
But I can cut to the chase...

26:10.330 --> 26:12.249
we're willing to cut
our ask to $6 million,

26:12.250 --> 26:14.789
but we want a public apology.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.539
Take your time with it.

26:16.540 --> 26:20.710
This is our...
this is our counter.

26:23.290 --> 26:27.379
Just so you know,
we already cut our ask in half.

26:27.380 --> 26:29.080

they're asking us

26:51.670 --> 26:53.249
to pay damages on a TV show

26:53.250 --> 26:54.539
they never intended
to broadcast.

26:54.540 --> 26:56.249
No, Your Honor, I'm sorry,

26:56.250 --> 26:58.749
but that's untrue.
It's a valued show.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.209
Look, they won round one,
Your Honor.

27:00.210 --> 27:01.619
Our client dropped the episode

27:01.620 --> 27:02.999
on the Internet.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.209
This is round two.

27:04.210 --> 27:05.749
What are the damages?

27:05.750 --> 27:07.079
And we would argue
there are no damages.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.419
When Donald Trump
was elected president,

27:08.420 --> 27:10.119
the network decided
to dump the episode.

27:10.120 --> 27:14.539
And they can't claim damages
on something that is worthless.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.829
Your Honor, I am stunned. I
don't even know how to respond.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.959
I don't, either. So let's
hear from the witnesses.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.749
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:20.750 --> 27:22.170
(chuckling):
Yeah.

27:23.170 --> 27:24.879
Yeah, but he's
giving us the names.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.749
He's cooperating.

27:26.750 --> 27:30.250
And we never agreed to anything
other than his bail.

27:36.830 --> 27:41.209
I'll... let's deal
with this later.

27:41.210 --> 27:43.580
Okay? Okay. Bye.

27:47.380 --> 27:49.249
Hi.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.539

27:51.540 --> 27:54.619
No. I don't think so,
which is weird

27:54.620 --> 27:57.249

28:13.540 --> 28:15.329

What is it?

28:15.330 --> 28:17.709
I don't know. Check, please.

28:17.710 --> 28:20.289
Yeah.
They're a little slow here,

28:20.290 --> 28:22.709
but that just gives us longer

28:22.710 --> 28:24.669

Check, please.

28:24.670 --> 28:27.119
I represent Reddick,
Boseman & Koldstad.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.499
Aha. So they hired someone.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.209
Well, good for them.

28:33.210 --> 28:37.249
Uh, look, here's the thing,

28:38.250 --> 28:39.250

28:39.251 --> 28:40.959
Yeah, whatever.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.459
So, you're making a deal
with Henry Rindell.

28:42.460 --> 28:44.419
You heard my phone call?

28:44.420 --> 28:46.919
Yes, but I also saw
that Mr. Rindell

28:46.920 --> 28:49.079
was released on bail.

28:49.080 --> 28:52.249
You must have some sway
in the Department of Justice.

28:52.250 --> 28:55.669
I do, and I've never
heard of you.

28:55.670 --> 28:57.749
That's because
I'm just little old me.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.959
"Little old me"
who follows people

28:59.960 --> 29:01.249
and listens
to their phone calls.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.329
Oh, your check came.

29:02.330 --> 29:04.539
Let me treat.
No, no. I got it.

29:04.540 --> 29:06.329
Here's the thing, uh...

29:06.330 --> 29:08.209
Oh, ELSBETH.
...ELSBETH,

29:08.210 --> 29:10.579
I do have some sway at the DOJ,

29:10.580 --> 29:13.919
and I think you'll find
that I'm a pretty tough foe.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.750
You go after me professionally,
I'll go after you personally.

29:19.790 --> 29:22.419
And I tend to win.

29:22.420 --> 29:25.329
Yikes. That sounds scary.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.999
No. Just telling the truth.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.789
Don't follow me.

29:28.790 --> 29:30.790
Don't listen to my phone calls.

29:35.290 --> 29:36.829
ADRIAN:
<i>The defense calls</i>

29:36.830 --> 29:38.709
Mr. Maurice Weintraub
to the stand.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.709
Objection. Your Honor,

29:40.710 --> 29:42.419
I'm sorry, but Mr. Weintraub

29:42.420 --> 29:43.959
isn't on
the defense witness list.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.039
We're calling him as a
rebuttal witness, Your Honor.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.119
Mr. Weintraub was on
the plaintiff's list.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.919
Well, then he's
on a list somewhere.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.040
Let's get him here.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.329
LUCCA:
Mr. Weintraub,

30:00.330 --> 30:02.829
when did your network
plan to air

30:02.830 --> 30:03.830
Mr. Fisk's episode?

30:03.831 --> 30:05.749
A quick correction.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.959
It's not his episode.
The episode he wrote.

30:07.960 --> 30:11.379
No, for the purpose of
copyright, we wrote the episode.

30:11.380 --> 30:15.789
The studio and the
network, we paid Mr. Fisk

30:15.790 --> 30:18.209
for a work for hire.
Okay.

30:18.210 --> 30:20.329
Then let's discuss
the episode you wrote.

30:20.330 --> 30:22.539
It must've been hard facing
that blank page, sir.

30:22.540 --> 30:23.619
What did Hemingway call it?

30:23.620 --> 30:25.209
Objection, Your Honor.

30:25.210 --> 30:27.119
I guess I'd call it
sarcastic badgering.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.789
GLATT:
Sustained.

30:28.790 --> 30:30.119
Unsarcastically.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.169
LUCCA:
Okay, then let's try this.

30:32.170 --> 30:33.749
When did you decide
to air this episode?

30:33.750 --> 30:34.789
MAURICE:
Sometime in May,

30:34.790 --> 30:36.119
but now it's been online,

30:36.120 --> 30:37.209
there's no value in doing so.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.209
And how many episodes
of this show

30:39.210 --> 30:41.999
does your network
air every year?
22.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.829
Didn't you order 23 episodes
this year, sir?

30:43.830 --> 30:44.959
Yes, that's true.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.329
And didn't you order 23 episodes

30:46.330 --> 30:48.709
not at the beginning
of the year, as you usually do,

30:48.710 --> 30:51.919
but after you decided you
couldn't air Mr. Fisk's episode?

30:51.920 --> 30:52.830
Yes, that's right.

30:52.831 --> 30:54.419
When we realized Mr. Fisk

30:54.420 --> 30:55.919
had put the episode online,

30:55.920 --> 30:59.039
we knew we needed
an additional episode.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.039
Yeah, but this happened before
he put the episode online.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.210
Objection.
Counselor is testifying.

31:05.880 --> 31:06.999
GLATT:
Sustained.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.209
Okay, well, here is a memo

31:10.210 --> 31:13.619
to the show's writing staff,

31:13.620 --> 31:15.619
asking for
an additional episode.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.830
Could you read the date there?

31:26.880 --> 31:29.209
November 18, 2016.

31:29.210 --> 31:32.619
LUCCA: Wasn't that before my
client put the episode online?

31:32.620 --> 31:34.289
AMBER: Objection.
Beyond the scope.

31:34.290 --> 31:35.670
GLATT:
Sustained.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.289
Isn't it true, sir, that
after Trump won the presidency,

31:41.290 --> 31:43.499
you were worried
the episode would offend him,

31:43.500 --> 31:45.079
so you decided not to show it,

31:45.080 --> 31:47.079
and that's why you needed
a 23rd episode?

31:47.080 --> 31:50.169
(laughing):
No, sometimes we just...

31:50.170 --> 31:52.209
it's a popular show.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.829
Sometimes we order
more episodes.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.080
Okay. Nothing further.

32:01.250 --> 32:04.330
Mr. Boseman, a word.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.079
I hear your firm
is looking to branch out

32:10.080 --> 32:11.579
into other areas of expertise.

32:11.580 --> 32:14.289
We're always looking
for opportunities.

32:14.290 --> 32:16.249
Well, if you don't mind
some unsolicited advice...

32:16.250 --> 32:18.119
Is it free?

32:18.120 --> 32:20.749
You'll find that entertainment
law is an extremely small pond.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.329
This little performance
you're putting on

32:22.330 --> 32:24.329
will only help you
up to a point.

32:24.330 --> 32:25.999
When you embarrass men
like Mr. Weintraub,

32:26.000 --> 32:27.459
you've passed that point.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.749
You are a real kick.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.119
Yep.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.379
And I'll kick your ass
if you're not careful.

32:33.380 --> 32:37.210
Oh. I can't wait.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.169
You're not bad.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.249
No, I'm good.

32:44.250 --> 32:46.119
Well, a little sarcastic, maybe.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.499
Judges don't like that.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.749
This is so helpful,
being graded. Thank you.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.249
I think we have a
sarcasm problem here.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.119
Is there some reason
why you're here?

32:53.120 --> 32:56.169
Yes. I spoke to the
assistant attorney general

32:56.170 --> 32:57.919
on your firm's behalf.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.459
I don't think you'll be
having any problems anymore.

33:00.460 --> 33:02.170
Hmm.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.579
The usual response is thank you.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.619
Yes. Thank you.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.959
He's now coming after
our firm for our connection

33:10.960 --> 33:12.169
to the Rindell Fund.

33:12.170 --> 33:15.579
We've had to hire
a firm-wide lawyer.

33:15.580 --> 33:17.169
What?
Yeah.

33:17.170 --> 33:18.999
Thank you.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.829
Okay. Okay, now I'm pissed.

33:21.830 --> 33:24.039
Yeah, you look it.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.040
Thanks.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.619
FISK: It was fantastic.
You were fantastic.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.039
Did you, did you see his face
when you made him read the date?

33:39.040 --> 33:41.039
You made him read it.
It was classic.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.749
It was like Perry Mason.
Yep.

33:42.750 --> 33:46.079
I think we've taken
this as far as we can,

33:46.080 --> 33:48.170
so we should think
about a possible deal.

33:51.210 --> 33:53.039
What?

33:53.040 --> 33:55.619
I'm sorry, I... we have them
on the run now, right?

33:55.620 --> 33:57.459
We don't have a smoking gun.

33:57.460 --> 34:01.249
Without that, we have to assume

34:01.250 --> 34:02.709
we're gonna lose the
case on the merits.

34:02.710 --> 34:04.669
What we're left with, Keith,
is trying to get the network

34:04.670 --> 34:07.169
to agree to a dollar
amount you can live with.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.920
If you'll excuse me.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.619
Oh, wow.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.289
So, we should talk
about your assets.

34:16.290 --> 34:17.708
It'll ruin me.

34:17.710 --> 34:21.498
You don't think they'll take
my Prius, do you?

34:21.500 --> 34:23.619
No. Oh, hi there, Diane.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.748
Mr. Gross.
But look at this place.

34:25.750 --> 34:27.879
A real African-American
law firm.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.119
I love it.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.829
Everywhere you look.

34:30.830 --> 34:32.289
Except here.
White, white, white.

34:32.290 --> 34:34.329
Marissa.
Yep. I'm leaving.

34:34.330 --> 34:37.168
Oh, no, no. Wait, stay.
Take some notes or something.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.290
Sure. I'll just
sit right here.

34:41.210 --> 34:44.748
So, Diane, I am thinking
of adding your firm

34:44.750 --> 34:45.879
to my Midwest business.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.168
What do you say about that?

34:47.170 --> 34:48.708
I say that's a great idea.
Good.

34:48.710 --> 34:52.079
Yeah, we could use a little
fight in our legal department.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.829
Oh, you'll get that here.
Fighting is in our blood.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.458
Oh, I know. You know
how I know that?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.619
No, actually, no.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.499
This case you're bringing
against the networks

34:59.500 --> 35:01.329
for sucking up to Trump.
I know. Isn't that great?

35:01.330 --> 35:03.039
No other firm
would take it.
NEIL: Exactly.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.169
Everybody's so
afraid of that guy.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.919
But I say we do to Trump

35:05.920 --> 35:08.419
the same thing the
Republicans did to Obama.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.499
Don't settle, don't negotiate,

35:10.500 --> 35:12.249
and don't back down.

35:12.250 --> 35:13.419
MARISSA:
Well, wait till you see

35:13.420 --> 35:15.119
the way they go after
the network in court.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.119
NEIL: See that?
This is why I'm here, Diane.

35:18.120 --> 35:21.329
I just have a bunch
of old-fart, white guys

35:21.330 --> 35:22.419
who don't know how to fight.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.619
That's why I'm thinking
about coming here.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.329
You guys know how to fight.

35:25.330 --> 35:27.619
So let's fight.
Indeed.

35:27.620 --> 35:31.210
Um, could you just give me
one minute, Mr. Gross?

35:38.170 --> 35:40.999
Here's my worry,
Ms. Tascioni.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.959
Maia and I have attorney/client
privilege and...

35:42.960 --> 35:44.539
Yes, and so do we,

35:44.540 --> 35:46.499
because I represent the firm.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.499
Y-Yes, but some of these
issues are only Maia's.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.959
Hmm, then she should
quit the firm

35:51.960 --> 35:54.669
because her issues are hurting
the firm's interests.

35:54.670 --> 35:55.959
YESHA: No, I-I don't
think that's what...

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
What do you want to know?

35:56.961 --> 36:00.039
Why is your dad out on bail?

36:00.040 --> 36:03.039
I don't know.

36:03.040 --> 36:07.249
What names might he
have given to Mr. Kresteva?

36:07.250 --> 36:08.959
Maia, I don't think you
should answer that. You...

36:08.960 --> 36:12.999
My dad had me download
and give to him a list

36:13.000 --> 36:15.789
of all the VIP clients that
the fund did illegal work for.

36:15.790 --> 36:19.039
And you think he
gave them those names?

36:19.040 --> 36:20.459
Yes.

36:20.460 --> 36:21.619
Did you look at the list?

36:21.620 --> 36:22.999
Yes.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.039
Were there any names
connected to this firm?

36:25.040 --> 36:26.789
No. No, I looked them all up.

36:26.790 --> 36:28.959
There are no clients,
no lawyers from this firm.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.039
Are you sure?

36:31.040 --> 36:35.459
Because he found someone...
I like that lipstick.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.249
(gasps)
That's a good color.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.879
Thank you.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.669
What is it?

36:41.670 --> 36:44.039
(chuckles)
Dior.

36:44.040 --> 36:44.960
Rouge.
(gasps)

36:44.961 --> 36:46.329
Well, I mean,
it could be Chanel.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.539
No. There is a Reddick,
Boseman lawyer

36:49.540 --> 36:51.119
connected to that VIP list.

36:51.120 --> 36:54.039
Who?
You.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.209
You implicated yourself
by downloading that list

36:56.210 --> 36:58.329
and getting it to your father,

36:58.330 --> 37:01.329
but that would require
your father turning on you,

37:01.330 --> 37:04.210
and he wouldn't turn on you,
would he?

37:08.080 --> 37:12.419
Okay, let's leave this here.

37:12.420 --> 37:17.329
And I will try to find
out something more.

37:17.330 --> 37:18.879
Oh, and...

37:18.880 --> 37:22.669
if your dad asks anything
more of you, Maia,

37:22.670 --> 37:25.249
I urge you to say no.

37:25.250 --> 37:28.879
He might be doing something
at Mr. Kresteva's bidding

37:28.880 --> 37:30.749
in order to lighten
his sentence.

37:30.750 --> 37:33.079
He might also be recording
your conversations.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.459
I hate to talk that way, but...

37:34.460 --> 37:37.920
you pay me to be suspicious.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.999
Okay.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.540
I'm going. Bye.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.040
(mouthing)

38:02.080 --> 38:03.080
How do you feel?

38:03.081 --> 38:05.289
You didn't have to come.

38:05.290 --> 38:06.709
I know I didn't have to come.

38:06.710 --> 38:08.119
Thank you.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.919
It's the last time
I'm doing this.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.079
Just picture them all naked.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.749
(applause)

38:14.750 --> 38:16.039
(exhales)

38:16.040 --> 38:17.329
You'll like me
even if I fuck up?

38:17.330 --> 38:19.880
I will.
Break a leg.

38:29.290 --> 38:30.920
Good evening.

38:33.580 --> 38:35.919
Take a hair from your head.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.329
Now imagine that
you can split that hair

38:38.330 --> 38:41.119
down the middle
not once, not twice,

38:41.120 --> 38:42.999
but 50 times.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
That is the equivalent
of two microns.

38:50.210 --> 38:52.539
To be effective at ballistics,

38:52.540 --> 38:55.499
that is the measure
that we need to be discussing.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
Thanks for coming.
Thank you.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.919
Great.
I mean, you didn't rush.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.079
You made all your points
comprehensible.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.000
I'm...

39:11.960 --> 39:14.419
Rindell's still reluctant
to give up her name.

39:14.420 --> 39:19.579
No, just a more
aggressive posture, that's all.

39:19.580 --> 39:24.249
Yeah. Okay, I'm home.
Bye.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.919
Say, D.
What's happening?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.829
Where are you?
Back here.

39:28.830 --> 39:31.709
Oh... the ice cream.

39:31.710 --> 39:33.669
I totally forgot.
I'm happy to go back out.

39:33.670 --> 39:34.709
DIEDRE:
No, no, no, we got some.

39:34.710 --> 39:35.999
(chuckling)

39:36.000 --> 39:39.499
Sounds like you've
been drinking already.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.709
Mike, you're late.

39:41.710 --> 39:42.829
Are you all right?

39:42.830 --> 39:47.169
Yeah.
Uh, yeah.

39:47.170 --> 39:51.419
I just wasn't expecting
to see...

39:51.420 --> 39:53.619
Your friend from work.

39:53.620 --> 39:55.919
How come you've
never introduced us?

39:55.920 --> 39:57.579
ELSBETH:
I said the same thing.

39:57.580 --> 39:59.039
Mike is so private at work.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.579
I was shopping at Trader Joe's

40:01.580 --> 40:03.209
when ELSBETH heard my last name
and we started talking.

40:03.210 --> 40:06.039
About you skinny-dipping

40:06.040 --> 40:07.879
in Hawaii.
She got that out of me.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.459
We were so sunburned.
Oh, my God.

40:09.460 --> 40:12.039
And she invited herself over?

40:12.040 --> 40:13.209
No, I invited her.

40:13.210 --> 40:14.879
I didn't want to drink alone.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.999
But then ELSBETH offered
to help me address

40:17.000 --> 40:19.999
all of the thank you notes
for our anniversary.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.289
ELSBETH:
It was my pleasure.

40:21.290 --> 40:23.919
I just love this kitchen,

40:23.920 --> 40:25.579
by the way.
You are so sweet.

40:25.580 --> 40:26.879
And the study.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.879
Oh, yes, I love your study.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.879
The way you make the-the
whole thing work together.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.499
You were...
I'm terrible with colors.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.039
...in my study?

40:35.040 --> 40:37.999
Yeah, on my way to the bathroom.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.459
I see.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.959
Mike, come on.
Give me a kiss.

40:41.960 --> 40:44.999
ELSBETH was just saying
how fun you are at the office.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.919
He is.
(laughs)

40:47.920 --> 40:50.580
I'll be right back.

41:11.750 --> 41:14.039
In college, Mike
was a cheerleader.
Oh.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.999
And I was the shy girl.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.919
You weren't shy.
I was.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.749
No. The way you are now?

41:20.750 --> 41:22.749
That's because
I'm drinking.
Aw.

41:22.750 --> 41:24.919
But Mike really pulled me
out of my shell, didn't you?

41:24.920 --> 41:26.079
Yeah.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.579
Thanks for dropping by.

41:28.580 --> 41:32.289
Oh, yes.
I guess I should go.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.789
No, no, stay for dinner.

41:34.790 --> 41:36.289
No, no, no.
Maybe, uh...

41:36.290 --> 41:38.249
maybe some other time.
Yes.

41:38.250 --> 41:39.499
And we have that lunch date.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.039
Oh, yeah?
When's that?

41:42.040 --> 41:43.040
Next week, right?

41:43.041 --> 41:44.919
Right.
I'm treating.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.749
No, I'm treating.
(both laugh)

41:46.750 --> 41:48.079
I'll walk you out.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.329
Oh, don't bother, Mike.

41:49.330 --> 41:51.080
Oh, it's no bother.

41:53.290 --> 41:54.959
I could have you disbarred

41:54.960 --> 41:56.539
for doing something like that.

41:56.540 --> 41:58.079
You come to <i>my </i> home...

41:58.080 --> 41:59.879
I was invited into your home.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.079
Go through my desk,

42:01.080 --> 42:02.999
shake down my wife
for information.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.919
I would never shake down DIEDRE.

42:04.920 --> 42:05.999
She's too lovely.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.379
Yeah, well, let's see

42:07.380 --> 42:09.379
what a disbarment
committee says.

42:09.380 --> 42:11.919
Get home safe.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.959
Yeah, let's see what they say.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.379
What was your quote?
Um...

42:17.380 --> 42:19.999
"When you go after me
professionally,

42:20.000 --> 42:21.999
I go after you
personally."

42:22.000 --> 42:24.999
I never said that.
Yes, you did.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.619
At the diner.

42:26.620 --> 42:27.959
That's a lie.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.619
(beep)

42:29.620 --> 42:31.249
MIKE:
You go after me professionally,

42:31.250 --> 42:34.329
I'll go after you personally.

42:34.330 --> 42:36.039
It's an illegal recording.

42:36.040 --> 42:37.959
Yes, unless it's used

42:37.960 --> 42:39.669
to contradict a lie.

42:39.670 --> 42:40.789
DIEDRE:
Is everything all right?

42:40.790 --> 42:42.960
Oh, yeah, just
something at work.

42:45.750 --> 42:47.829
Bye!

42:47.830 --> 42:49.830
(car door opens)

42:51.460 --> 42:52.790
(car door closes)

42:59.000 --> 43:01.419
90% of the media in this country

43:01.420 --> 43:04.209
is controlled by six
corporations, Your Honor.

43:04.210 --> 43:06.079
Think about that.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.709
Think.

43:08.710 --> 43:12.249
A column of tanks
in Tiananmen Square,

43:12.250 --> 43:13.419
for instance, is one way

43:13.420 --> 43:15.879
of controlling what people see,

43:15.880 --> 43:19.039
hear, but it is not
the only way, Your Honor.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.079
(whispering):
I thought we were negotiating.

43:21.080 --> 43:24.039
Adrian thinks we can do better.

43:24.040 --> 43:27.579
A government intent on stifling
the free flow of ideas

43:27.580 --> 43:32.379
need only stifle
these six corporations.

43:32.380 --> 43:38.169
Your Honor, we are living
in Tiananmen Square right here.

43:38.170 --> 43:41.249
And this young man, by putting
an episode of television

43:41.250 --> 43:44.579
on a Web site, stood in front
of those tanks.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.999
And I am asking this court today

43:47.000 --> 43:50.499
to stop those tanks from
crushing this young man's spirit

43:50.500 --> 43:52.459
and his defiance.

43:52.460 --> 43:53.460
GLATT:
Okay.

43:53.461 --> 43:56.669
Good speech.

43:56.670 --> 43:58.669
Now can I make my decision?

43:58.670 --> 44:00.999
Oh, God, please.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.039
Your Honor, we have new evidence

44:02.040 --> 44:03.789
just come to our attention.

44:03.790 --> 44:06.379
Your Honor, you were
just about to decide.

44:06.380 --> 44:07.879
Your Honor, we believe
this evidence

44:07.880 --> 44:10.289
touches upon your
First Amendment concern.

44:10.290 --> 44:12.039
What is it?

44:12.040 --> 44:13.959
The president just tweeted
this morning, Your Honor.

44:13.960 --> 44:17.579
"Congrats to Weintraub
for standing up

44:17.580 --> 44:21.379
"to another Hollywood crybaby.

44:21.380 --> 44:25.539
Time to look into
who they hire to write."

44:25.540 --> 44:28.379
That tweet is Prima
facie government action

44:28.380 --> 44:29.959
that triggers a First
Amendment defense.

44:29.960 --> 44:31.919
You said this morning,
Your Honor,

44:31.920 --> 44:34.289
this is not
a First Amendment case.

44:34.290 --> 44:38.959
But I submit,
in all due respect,

44:38.960 --> 44:40.290
now it is.

44:46.710 --> 44:48.789
(sighs)

44:48.790 --> 44:52.579
A public apology
and we'll call it even.

44:52.580 --> 44:54.709
No.

44:54.710 --> 44:57.119
What, you want us to pay <i>you?</i>

44:57.120 --> 45:00.999
No public apology,
and we'll call it even.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.499
I'll talk to my clients.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.749
I hope that was worth it to you,

45:04.750 --> 45:07.580
because it won't do much
for your business.

45:08.960 --> 45:11.459
Is it worth it to us?

45:11.460 --> 45:13.040
We'll see.

45:21.670 --> 45:23.829
You don't like talking
about yourself much, do you?

45:23.830 --> 45:25.789
I'm just walking.

45:25.790 --> 45:28.209
No, we've talked
everything about me.

45:28.210 --> 45:30.919
My overbearing family,
my sister's parachuting record,

45:30.920 --> 45:32.379
my struggle with addiction.

45:32.380 --> 45:34.459
Yeah, Diet Coke doesn't
really count.

45:34.460 --> 45:35.999
But nothing about you.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.879
There is nothing about me.

45:37.880 --> 45:39.919
Are your parents happy
that you're a lawyer?

45:39.920 --> 45:42.419
I guess.

45:42.420 --> 45:45.169
Oh, my God, it's like
a cross-examination.

45:45.170 --> 45:47.789
Are they both
still alive?
Yes.

45:47.790 --> 45:49.669
Who's your best friend?

45:49.670 --> 45:51.169
I don't have a friend.

45:51.170 --> 45:55.039
Stop. Look at me.
Say it again.

45:55.040 --> 45:59.120
I don't have a friend.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.329
I don't believe you.

46:02.330 --> 46:05.459
That's your right.

46:05.460 --> 46:07.669
What?

46:07.670 --> 46:10.829
Please don't say
you're gonna save me.

46:10.830 --> 46:13.499
No, I'm gonna kiss you.

46:13.500 --> 46:15.290

No, I think we should
figure this out now.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.709
What do you want?

50:14.710 --> 50:18.749
I want my capital contribution
to come directly from

50:18.750 --> 50:20.579
the Chumhum retainer.

50:20.580 --> 50:22.750
And I want to be made
a name partner.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.879
We'll have to run that
by the partnership committee.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.039
Seriously?
We will run it by

50:29.040 --> 50:32.249
the partnership committee,

50:32.250 --> 50:35.249
but the answer is yes.

50:35.250 --> 50:39.289
Congratulations,
Diane Lockhart, full partner.

50:39.290 --> 50:41.039
Thank you.

50:41.040 --> 50:44.000
It's good to be wanted.

50:50.290 --> 50:51.790
She's gonna be trouble.
