CONSIDERING TAKING A SHOT AT ONE

01:21.344 --> 01:22.586
OF THEM.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.137
I'M THINK BEING TAKING A SHOT
AT CHRISTIAN BUT BECAUSE HE IS

01:24.172 --> 01:27.448
SUMP A COMP BEAST YOU CAN'T JUST
NOMINATE HIM, IT HAS TO BE A

01:27.482 --> 01:28.551

SO DEREK X NEEDED PAWNS.

FOR YOU HER.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.413
IF THIS BACK DOOR PLAN TO GET
CHRISIAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SB

01:59.448 --> 02:04.275
GOES OUT INSTEAD, THAT WOULD BE
MORE BENEFICIAL TO MY PERSONAL

02:04.310 --> 02:05.206
GAME.

02:05.241 --> 02:06.586
Announcer: AT THE

HELLO WORLD.

02:55.448 --> 03:02.034

OVER.

03:02.068 --> 03:05.137
I NOMINATED BRITINI AND SARAH
THIS WEEK BUT REALLY THEY'RE

03:05.172 --> 03:07.413
BOTH JUST PAWNS SO I CAN BACK
DOOR CHRISTIAN.

03:07.448 --> 03:10.551
CHRISTIAN IS AN ABSOLUTE COMP
BEAST AND EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE

03:10.586 --> 03:11.724
KNOWS IT.

03:11.758 --> 03:16.689
SO WHEN HE HITS THE BLOCK, I'M
POSITIVE HE'S GOING HOME.

03:16.724 --> 03:17.965
I'M SURPRISED.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.689
I DIDN'T THINK DEREK WOULD TAKE
A SHOT AT THE ROYAL FLUSH THIS

03:21.724 --> 03:22.758
EARLY.

03:22.793 --> 03:24.448
I'M DEFINITELY GOING STRAIGHT
INTO SURVIVAL MODE.

03:24.482 --> 03:34.551
I JUST NEED TO DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO MAKE SURE I STAY HERE.

03:34.586 --> 03:36.310
I AM ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATED.

03:36.344 --> 03:40.241
NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE BESIDES ME
UNDERSTAND WHAT GOING ON THE

03:40.275 --> 03:42.620
BLOCK MORE THAN ONCE FEELS LIKE.

03:42.655 --> 03:43.793
BRIT.

03:43.827 --> 03:45.689
I WAS ONLY SAFE FOR SEVEN
DAYS AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW

03:45.724 --> 03:47.793
WHAT THE HELL I DID TO GET ME
HERE.

03:47.827 --> 03:50.482
BUT I'M PISSED.

03:50.517 --> 03:51.482
I KNOW.

03:51.517 --> 03:58.275
NO ONE ELSE IN THIS HOUSE,
ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:58.310 --> 03:59.482
TAKE A DEEP BREATHE.

03:59.517 --> 04:02.275
ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW?

04:02.310 --> 04:11.689
COME HERE, COME HERE, TAKE A
DEEP BREATHE, COME ON, COME ON.

04:11.724 --> 04:14.896
THERE HAS TO BE A REASON.

04:14.931 --> 04:15.965
FOR WHAT?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.482
IF I DON'T WIN THE FREAKING
VETO, THIS IS SO BAD.

04:19.517 --> 04:25.689
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:25.724 --> 04:27.448
WHY DID HE DO THAT?

04:27.482 --> 04:30.620
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

04:30.655 --> 04:32.379
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

04:32.413 --> 04:34.310
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

04:34.344 --> 04:37.517
HE JUST PISSED OFF THE
JOCKERS BY PUTTING UP SOMEONE ON

04:37.551 --> 04:41.793
THEIR TEAM, PISSED OFF THE KINGS
BY PUTTING SOMEONE UP ON THEIR

04:41.827 --> 04:42.931
TEAM.

04:42.965 --> 04:45.275
I KNOW WE THINK THIS IS
STUPID BUT HE CLEARLY HAS AN

04:45.310 --> 04:46.413
IDEA IN HIS HEAD.

04:46.448 --> 04:47.655
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

04:47.689 --> 04:51.034
WHAT THE HECK IS DEREK X
DOING NOMINATING A MEMBER OF HIS

04:51.068 --> 04:52.172
OWN ALLIANCE.

04:52.206 --> 04:57.068
THE FACT THERE THAT THERE IS A
ROYAL FLUSH MEMBER UP IS

04:57.103 --> 04:57.724
EXTREMELY.

04:57.758 --> 04:58.793
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

04:58.827 --> 05:00.827
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.

05:00.862 --> 05:02.172
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

05:02.206 --> 05:03.275
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

05:03.310 --> 05:05.275
YOU NEED TO AT LEAST PICK ONE
OF US FOR THE VETO.

05:05.310 --> 05:09.034
IF YOU GET CHOICE, YOU WILL
TAKE ME.

05:09.068 --> 05:10.310
YES.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.379
OKAY, I'M FOR SURE USING IT
ON YOU, YOU CAN PROMISE ME THAT.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.482
THE KINGS ARE TELLING ME THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR ME 1

05:15.517 --> 05:16.000
MUN%.

05:16.034 --> 05:17.068
THEY DO SEEM ANGRY.

05:17.103 --> 05:18.413
I HOPE CAN I BELIEVE THEM.

05:18.448 --> 05:21.827
THE BEST NEXT STEP FOR ME IS TO
TALK TO DEREK X AND SEE WHAT IS

05:21.862 --> 05:23.482
REALLY GOING ON.

05:23.517 --> 05:33.517
I'M PISSED, SO I WILL FIGHT
FOR YOU.

05:58.103 --> 06:02.034
I HAVE A FEELING THAT DEREK X
MIGHT NOT TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT'S

06:02.068 --> 06:03.310
GOING ON.

06:03.344 --> 06:05.793
AND I NEED THIS MAN TO BE HONEST
WITH ME ABOUT WHAT HIS ACTUAL

06:05.827 --> 06:07.034
PLAN IS.

06:07.068 --> 06:11.551
SO MY FIRST TACTIC TO BE DEAD
SILENT AND JUS LET HIM SIT IN

06:11.586 --> 06:19.137
THE AWKWARDNESS UNTIL HE BREAKS.

06:19.172 --> 06:21.896
OKAY, I WILL JUST SAY IT, I
CAN'T DO, THIS I DON'T WANT YOU

06:21.931 --> 06:22.931
TO GO HOME THIS WEEK.

06:22.965 --> 06:29.379
YOU ARE NOT MY TAR GET.

06:29.413 --> 06:36.241
I MADE A DEAL WITH ALYSSA AND X
ON THE WALL, THE REALLY THE ONLY

06:36.275 --> 06:41.862
CHOICE HI FOR SOMEONE TO PUT UP.

06:41.896 --> 06:45.827
AND THEN IF I HAD NOMINATED TWO
OF THEM, I WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR

06:45.862 --> 06:47.344
ENTIRE TEAM.

06:47.379 --> 06:50.896
IT WOULD STILL BE MAD THAT
YOU PUT UP ONE OF THE JOKERS.

06:50.931 --> 06:54.206
I KNOW YOU ARE A SMART TBIE,
THAT IS WHY IT WAS FISHY TO ME,

06:54.241 --> 06:56.172
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

06:56.206 --> 06:59.793
IF I'M REALLY NOT YOUR TARGET
AND YOU JUST WANT BRITINI TO GO

06:59.827 --> 07:03.172
HOME, BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF I COME
OFF THE BLOCK.

07:03.206 --> 07:05.034
THEN YOU PUT UP TWO OF THEM
ANYWAYS.

07:05.068 --> 07:11.172
YOU THINK I WILL PUT UP A
JOKER?

07:11.206 --> 07:13.448
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PUT UP A
JOKER?

07:13.482 --> 07:18.724
IF I GET CHOICE I'M PROBABLY
PICKING CHRISTIAN CUZ WE KNOW

07:18.758 --> 07:20.482
WILL TAKE YOU DOWN.

07:20.517 --> 07:22.448
SURE ENOUGH IF YOU PICK
CHRISTIAN AND HE WINS THE VETO

07:22.482 --> 07:28.482
I'M GOING TO TELL HIM TO USE THE
VETO AND PUT UP ALYSSA.

07:28.517 --> 07:29.689
HE WON'T USE THE VETO.

07:29.724 --> 07:32.275
I JUST CAN'T HAVE HIM PLAYING
THIS VETO.

07:32.310 --> 07:35.000
AND I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN TAKE THE SHOT AT HIM,

07:35.034 --> 07:38.206
THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO DO IT ON
MY H.O.H.

07:38.241 --> 07:39.482
OH GOSH, OKAY.

07:39.517 --> 07:43.482
I AM NOT, LIKE, COMPLETELY
AGAINST THIS PLAN.

07:43.517 --> 07:46.758
I'M WILLING TO DO WHATEVER I
HAVE TO TO GET OFF THE BLOCK.

07:46.793 --> 07:48.379
I DO NOT WANT TO BE THERE
THURSDAY.

07:48.413 --> 07:51.241
I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT HE
WANTS TO TAKE A SHOT AT

07:51.275 --> 07:52.241
CHRISTIAN.

07:52.275 --> 07:53.862
I'M JUST SURPRISED THAT IT WOULD
BE THIS EARLY.

07:53.896 --> 07:57.344
I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR MY TEAM
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I'VE BEEN

07:57.379 --> 08:00.206
PLAYING AN INDIVIDUAL GAME THIS
ENTIRE TIME.

08:00.241 --> 08:03.965
SO I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO
THAT WHETHER THAT MEANS

08:04.000 --> 08:17.896
BETRAYING THEM OR NOT.

08:17.931 --> 08:23.482
HI, COULD I SPEAK WITH YOU.

08:23.517 --> 08:26.413
YEAH, YEAH.

08:26.448 --> 08:32.241
I HAD TO CONVINCE A FORM ARE
TEAM THAT SARAH BETH IS NOT MY

08:32.275 --> 08:33.413
TARGET.

08:33.448 --> 08:38.310
I AM STAYING TRUE TO THE ROYAL
FLUSH AND WE ARE TARGETING

08:38.344 --> 08:39.551
BRITINI.

08:39.586 --> 08:47.827
BASICALLY I DIDN'T WANT TO
NOMINATE TWO JOKERS THIS WEEK

08:47.862 --> 08:50.413
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A BAD MOVE
FOR MY PERSONAL GAME TO PUT UP

08:50.448 --> 08:52.344
TWO OF THEM.

08:52.379 --> 08:55.413
BECAUSE THAT PUTS A TARGET ON MY
BACK.

08:55.448 --> 08:59.448
SO TO THEM, IT WAS A COMPROMISE,
I WILL ONLY PUT UP ONE OF THEM.

08:59.482 --> 09:00.724
OKAY.

09:00.758 --> 09:08.206
AND THEN I WANTED TO THROW
ANY LIKE SUS OFF OF THE ALLIANCE

09:08.241 --> 09:11.896
BECAUSE -- IS SMART, I FEEL LIKE
SHE WILL FIGURE IT OUT IF I

09:11.931 --> 09:13.620
DIDN'T NOMINATE SOMEONE FROM THE
KINGS.

09:13.655 --> 09:16.068
OBVIOUSLY I TOLD YOU BOTH THAT
YOU WERE SAFE ON THE WALL.

09:16.103 --> 09:22.103
AND THEN IT JUST CAME DOWN TO
WHETHER OR NOT I WAS GOING TO DO

09:22.137 --> 09:23.344
SB OR CHRISTIAN.

09:23.379 --> 09:27.172
BUT PEOPLE KNOW THAT CHRISTIAN
IS MY SHIELD SO IT MAKES SENSE

09:27.206 --> 09:28.310
TO PUT HIM UP.

09:28.344 --> 09:37.172
TO BE CLEAR, BRITINI IS YOUR
TARGET THIS WEEK THEN?

09:37.206 --> 09:38.448
OKAY.

09:38.482 --> 09:39.724
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ON
THAT.

09:39.758 --> 09:43.482
I MIGHT BE NAIVE BUT I THINK
THE KINGS ARE BUYING WHAT I AM

09:43.517 --> 09:44.344
SAYING.

09:44.379 --> 09:46.827
AND THEY THINK BRITINI IS THE
TARGET.

09:46.862 --> 09:50.344
IN THE EVENT THAT ONE OF THE
NOMINEES TAKES THEMSELVES OFF

09:50.379 --> 09:53.137
THE BLOCK, THEN WHAT.

09:53.172 --> 09:55.482
IT WILL BE A JOKER.

09:55.517 --> 09:56.724
OKAY.

09:56.758 --> 09:58.793
YOU UP TO NOW WE HAVEN'T
GIVEN A REASON NOT TO TRUST YOU

09:58.827 --> 10:02.517
SO WE'RE GOING TO ROLL WITH IT
TWNS DEREK X'S EXPLANATION DOES

10:02.551 --> 10:03.655
MAKE SENSE.

10:03.689 --> 10:07.448
I DO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AFTER
SPEAKING WITH HIM THAT

10:07.482 --> 10:10.655
TRUTHFULLY THIS COULD HAVE JUST
BEEN A MISCOMMUNICATION.

10:10.689 --> 10:13.517
DEREK IS PART OF THE ROYAL FLUSH
ALLIANCE SO ULTIMATELY I DO

10:13.551 --> 10:17.655
TRUST HIM BUT I'M STILL
CAUTIOUS.

10:17.689 --> 10:19.172
IF SHE MOVE-- WE CAN MOVE ON.

10:19.206 --> 10:21.344
WE KNEW ONCE WE TALKED WITH
YOU, THERE WOULD BE CLARITY.

10:21.379 --> 10:23.827
WE WANTED IT TO MAKE MORE
SENSE AND NOW IT DOES.

10:23.862 --> 10:26.482
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GO
SO.

10:26.517 --> 10:27.482
COOL.

10:27.517 --> 10:30.413
I'M ALSO EXTREMELY TBRAITFUL
THAT IT'S NOT.

10:30.448 --> 10:31.793
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH

10:44.965 --> 10:46.172
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:46.206 --> 10:50.137
CUZ I'M PROMISING YOU, LOOKING
YOU IN THE EYE IF I WIN IT

10:50.172 --> 10:53.724
YOU'RE GETTING OFF THE BLOCK.

10:53.758 --> 11:00.448
IF ALYSSA USES THE VETO ON
ME, HER BEST ALLY WILL GO UP ON

11:00.482 --> 11:03.586
THE BLOCK AND IS PROBABLY GOING
TO GO HOME BUT HE CAN'T KNOW

11:03.620 --> 11:10.137
THAT BECAUSE I NEED TO COME OFF
THE BLOCK SO I KIND OF HAVE TO

11:10.172 --> 11:12.655
LET HER MAKE THIS MISTAKE.

11:12.689 --> 11:15.275
AND ST MY BIRTHDAY.

11:15.310 --> 11:21.965
IF HE DOESN'T TAKE ME OFF ON
MY BIRTHDAY-- .

11:22.000 --> 11:24.862
AS SOON TSH TSH IT IS GOING
100 PERCENT, YOU HAVE MY WORD.

11:24.896 --> 11:29.862
THANK YOU, A APPRECIATE THAT.

38:13.896 --> 38:15.034
SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL.

38:15.068 --> 38:18.068
AND IT IS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL
AND OVERWHELMING.

38:18.103 --> 38:22.862
THERE IS A LOT OF RISK HERE, I'M
BLIND SIDING KISSIAN AND IF HE

38:22.896 --> 38:26.896
FOR WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T GO
HOME THIS WEEKK I'M PUBLIC ENMY

38:26.931 --> 38:28.068
NUMBER ONE.

38:28.103 --> 38:37.655
I MIGHT GO PACK MY BAG THE SAME
NIGHT AND JUST GO HOME.

38:37.689 --> 38:44.206
WITHIN SOMEBODY GOT IN HIS HERE.

38:44.241 --> 38:46.517
THEY ARE TAKE ME OUT NOW.

38:46.551 --> 38:47.655
100 PERCENT.

38:47.689 --> 38:50.724
BUT EVERYONE IS GOING TO
CONSIDER TAKING YOU OUT IF

38:50.758 --> 38:54.310
KISSIAN SON THE BLOCK COME
THURSDAY AND IF HE GOES HOME YOU

38:54.344 --> 38:58.137
LOST THE SHIELD RKZ YOU BECOME
THE BIGGER TARGET.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.034
IT DON'T MAKE SENSE FOR ME TO
GO HOME.

39:00.068 --> 39:03.482
I AGREE.

39:03.517 --> 39:04.103
IF I AM.

39:04.137 --> 39:06.862
OH MY GOD.

39:06.896 --> 39:10.896
THIS IS QUITE LITERALLY THE
WORST POSITION ANYBODY COULD BE

39:10.931 --> 39:11.620
IN AT THIS POINT.

39:11.655 --> 39:13.758
I GOT TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THIS.

39:13.793 --> 39:15.689
BECAUSE I'M GOING UP AS A
REPLACEMENT IF I DON'T.

39:54.620 --> 39:58.965
THIS IS MY LAST OPPORTUNITY
TO FER SWAYED DEREK X TO STICK

39:59.000 --> 40:04.448
WITH THE FREAKING PLAN AND PUT
BIG D UP INSTEAD OF ME.

40:04.482 --> 40:11.655
DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR
DESPERATE MEASURES.

40:11.689 --> 40:16.413
REAL QUICK.

40:23.275 --> 40:25.172
I AM YOU ARE NEXT.

40:25.206 --> 40:29.724
I'M YOUR BIGGEST SHIELD.

40:29.758 --> 40:32.413
IT MEAKS SENSE.

40:32.448 --> 40:36.344
LAST WEEK I WAS H.O.H. AND I
DIDN'T QUESTION PUTTING YOU UP

40:36.379 --> 40:47.275
BECAUSE I KNOW-- -- WE WILL HAVE
TO COME AFTER EACH OTHER,

40:47.310 --> 40:48.793
EVENTUAL LEE, NOT NOW.

40:48.827 --> 40:58.448
JUST THINK APPROXIMATE IT.

40:58.482 --> 41:02.551
I HAVE NOT SAID YOUR NAME,
ULTIMATELY DO WHAT IS BEST FOR

41:02.586 --> 41:03.827
YOUR GIM.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.931
JUST THINK WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR
GAME IS THE SAME THING THAT IS

41:05.965 --> 41:09.448
BEST FOR WHAT MY GAME RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE OUR GAMES ARE SIMILAR.

41:09.482 --> 41:12.482
IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO STICK
TOGETHER.

41:12.517 --> 41:15.413
OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T PLAY NEXT
WEEK.

41:15.448 --> 41:26.586
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT.

41:26.620 --> 41:28.517
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.

41:28.551 --> 41:32.068
IT IT MAY SEEM LIKE I'M JUST
DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO PUT

41:32.103 --> 41:34.896
CHRISTIAN UP BUT THE
REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS ONE MOVE

41:34.931 --> 41:38.034
WILL AFFECT MY ENTIRE GAME THIS
SUMMER.

41:38.068 --> 41:41.172
NOW I'M STARTING TO WONDER IF S
BACK DOORING CHRISTIAN REALLY

41:41.206 --> 41:43.034
THE BEST MOVE FOR MY GAME.

41:43.068 --> 41:46.620
WILL DEREK X FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH HIS PLAN?

41:46.655 --> 41:52.000
FIND OUT TOMMORROW NIGHT AT 8/7
CENTRAL ON BIG BROTHER
