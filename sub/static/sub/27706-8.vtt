WEBVTT

00:02.628 --> 00:04.128
<i>Previously on</i> The Passage...

00:04.171 --> 00:06.130
- What now?
- We go back.

00:06.257 --> 00:08.340
Get Amy and get
you guys out of here.

00:08.426 --> 00:09.591
<i>Amy is my calling.</i>

00:09.677 --> 00:11.719
<i>My job is to protect that child</i>

00:11.804 --> 00:14.471
and all the promise
she holds out to the world.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.891
Martinez. Washington has
approved your security proposal.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.060
Cages now require two keys
used simultaneously

00:20.187 --> 00:22.062
on separate panels.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.398
Does Fanning ever talk to you
in his dreams?

00:24.483 --> 00:25.899
<i>The last thing he told me was.</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:27.484
<i>"We have work to do."</i>

00:27.570 --> 00:29.028
<i>Carter gave me the message.</i>

00:29.071 --> 00:30.863
Said we'd already changed
the world.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.365
<i>- What did you mean by that?
- You'll see.</i>

00:36.662 --> 00:39.163
- I don't want to die.
- So don't.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.206
<i>The next step
is right in front of you,</i>

00:41.250 --> 00:43.584
<i>-you just have to take it.</i>

00:43.669 --> 00:46.170
<i>What Fanning wants</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:47.899
is for you to believe
the worst about yourself.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.715
Don't buy it.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.091
<i>I don't want to be alone.</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:52.301
<i>You don't have to be.</i>

00:52.428 --> 00:53.886
<i>You can go anywhere you want.</i>

00:53.971 --> 00:57.097
Mama?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.141
Ain't nothing so bad
we can't fix it.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.768
What is this for?

01:00.895 --> 01:03.145
- Light your way.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.732
Hello, Amy.

01:11.864 --> 01:15.365
So, we're really gonna stick
with the silent treatment, huh?

01:16.494 --> 01:19.203
How'd you do all this, Amy?

01:19.330 --> 01:21.288
This is incredible detail.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.791
You got the homey feel,
you got this creak in the floor

01:23.918 --> 01:26.543
and the coup de grÃ¢ce
is that scent of bacon

01:26.587 --> 01:28.462
just wafting through the air.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.907
I've never seen
anything like that.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.965
What do you want?

01:32.093 --> 01:35.260
I want to know how a little kid
like you did all this.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.013
That's easy. I had help.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.224
Oh, from Carter. Right?

01:40.309 --> 01:43.018
Yeah, he's a good guy.

01:43.062 --> 01:45.312
He definitely has a soft spot
for you, doesn't he?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.234
Carter says I'm special.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.946
That I'm different.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.782
That's because you are.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.828
He also said
you would try to hurt me.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.830
That is not true.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.999
I'll tell you something
that is true.

02:06.127 --> 02:09.211
I wasn't nice to Carter
when he was turning.

02:09.295 --> 02:12.297
- Why?
- Because when you become

02:12.383 --> 02:15.425
what I am and Carter is,
it takes moxie,

02:15.511 --> 02:18.720
and I had to make sure that
he could tap into that power,

02:18.806 --> 02:19.930
that he was ready.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.182
Ready for what?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.686
For what's coming next.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.230
The end is near, my dear.

02:28.274 --> 02:31.358
I don't do riddles, dude.
Just say what you mean.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.196
All right, fair enough.

02:36.282 --> 02:38.031
Amy Bellafonte,

02:38.159 --> 02:42.327
I think that you are
truly amazing,

02:42.454 --> 02:44.830
and, if you'd let me,
I'd like to be your friend.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.585
Lungs are clear.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.920
Heart rate's slow and steady.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.922
What's happening?

02:54.008 --> 02:56.383
The girl is sick.

02:56.427 --> 02:59.052
Well, that's too bad.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.581 --> 03:27.497
Hey, Clark Richards.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.042
We're coming to the end here.

03:30.085 --> 03:33.795
And the only way you make it out
alive is with me.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.135
You had no right to authorize

03:40.262 --> 03:42.429
this move without consulting me.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.034
Well, that's some magical
thinking. I'm the director

03:44.058 --> 03:45.766
of this project.
I hired you, remember?

03:45.809 --> 03:47.392
Why are you doing this?

03:47.519 --> 03:48.997
No one is more disappointed
than I am.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.812
We all thought
she was proof of the concept.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.918
But it turns out she's no
different from the others,

03:52.942 --> 03:54.920
-so she goes to 4B.
- She's a little girl. It's not right.

03:54.944 --> 03:58.695
Listen to me. After Elizabeth
died, I went back to the lab.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.282
And I realized that-that
we could treat this like HIV.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.743
We could alter the cells
that the virus targets.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.246
- I could be close...
- "You could be close"?

04:07.331 --> 04:09.100
"You could be close"?
Do you even hear yourself?

04:09.124 --> 04:12.125
If I were you, I'd be sick
of gambling with people's lives.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.586
I have fought for every single
one of my patients.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.004
What about your coworkers?

04:16.130 --> 04:19.841
Simmons, Paulson, Pet.
And poor Elizabeth Lear.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.762
It's over for you, Nichole.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.264
Amy's not the answer.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.559
I'm rebooting Project Noah.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.354
I'll be making
an announcement shortly.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.550
I'll talk to the director of the
DoD and see about wrangling you

04:42.658 --> 04:44.658
a position as the head
of security here.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.744
- You'll report only to me.
- That'd be great, sir.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.497
I appreciate your taking
an interest in my career.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.501
Teachable moment here, Martinez,
from a management perspective:

04:54.628 --> 04:56.586
know the limitations
of your staff.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.998
To be fair, sir,
it did look like we were close.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.718
The girl had all of the features
and none of the bugs.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.489
Well, they don't give you
six points for getting the ball

05:04.513 --> 05:06.263
just to the two yard line.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.065
Thank you. Thank you, everyone,

05:17.192 --> 05:19.693
for gathering together here
on such short notice.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.987
I'll be brief.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.823
Your work here has been
nothing short of heroic.

05:24.908 --> 05:28.327
I want you to know
that your government sees you.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.329
That I see you.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.290
But we've come to an end
for most of you.

05:33.375 --> 05:37.461
As of today,
you're all relieved of duty.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.921
You can go back to your lives
and your families.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.633
I've authorized bonuses
for everyone

05:43.761 --> 05:46.386
as a thank-you
for your service.

05:46.472 --> 05:50.932
And I know how last days go, so
you have my blessing to party,

05:51.060 --> 05:53.977
but let's keep that
to off-shift hours, okay?

05:56.231 --> 05:57.459
Thanks for your service, fellas.

05:57.483 --> 05:58.793
What the hell's
going on, Guilder?

05:58.817 --> 06:00.650
I'm trying to save
this sinking ship.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.319
You're making
a terrible mistake.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.489
Look, Project Noah has ceased
to function competently.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.801
Now, you can blame it
on whatever you want:

06:06.825 --> 06:08.658
battle fatigue... I don't care.

06:08.744 --> 06:11.620
But I'm not gonna squander what
potential this program has left.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.308
These things are planning
something, Guilder.

06:13.332 --> 06:15.707
This is the wrong time
to cut everybody loose.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.504
Thank you for your service.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.631
Now go pack your bags.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.346
I have to get back in the lab

06:29.431 --> 06:31.076
and figure out how to make
this anti-viral work.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.808
And we need to get Amy
out of here.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.488
How do we override?

06:47.825 --> 06:50.534
Guilder.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.412
How long do we have
until Amy turns?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.498
<i>A Wrinkle in Time,</i> huh?

06:56.625 --> 06:58.250
That's a great book.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.626
It's phenomenal worldbuilding.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.752
Can I see it?

07:00.838 --> 07:01.962
Don't.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.804
I am not here to hurt you.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.890
I am here
just to get to know you.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.517
I don't want to know you.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.727
- I want the agent.
- I know.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.106
He's a good friend to you.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.941
But he's not here.

07:25.487 --> 07:29.573
You know, me and my friends,
we're like family.

07:29.700 --> 07:33.326
And we talk
and we, we share things,

07:33.454 --> 07:35.996
and lately, all the talk
has been about you.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.291
I'm never joining your family.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.878
I hear you, but
thing is, things are changing.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.381
I know you can feel it, right?

07:46.467 --> 07:50.760
Hmm. And when they change
all the way,

07:50.888 --> 07:53.138
you're gonna need someone
who understands.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.642
Can you just
get out of my house?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.690
We're coming to the end,
my friend.

08:03.734 --> 08:06.860
Things are gonna
start to get scary.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.987
And if you decide
that you need me,

08:09.072 --> 08:11.281
you just give a holler,

08:11.366 --> 08:13.074
and I'll come running.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.493
I promise.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.864
Oh, my God.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.972
Anthony.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.640
I was wondering

09:18.767 --> 09:21.351
when you were going to grace me
with your presence.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.894
Did you get lonely?

09:23.021 --> 09:24.729
You feel like playing
for the team now?

09:24.856 --> 09:26.523
Stay away from the kid.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.027
Are you seriously trying
to intimidate me?

09:31.113 --> 09:35.407
I see what you're doing to her,
and she's better off dead.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.158
She's not your 12th.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.743
Says my reluctant 11th.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.496
You're a monster.

09:41.582 --> 09:45.208
No. I'm just deeply sad
and annoyed.

09:45.294 --> 09:48.003
I did not recruit her
through some schoolyard fence,

09:48.130 --> 09:49.921
I did not put her
in this position

09:50.007 --> 09:52.966
and I did not give her the shot.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.302
But she <i> is</i> turning.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.846
And I can help her
just like I helped you.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.139
You only help yourself.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.643
I hate what you made me,

10:03.729 --> 10:06.896
- and I will never be like you.
- Then don't be like me.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.064
Be like you.

10:08.191 --> 10:11.693
Be like The Fonz for all I care.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.571
But if that girl doesn't turn,

10:14.656 --> 10:17.490
then none of us
get out of these cages.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.492
We need 12.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.495
Amy will turn.

10:22.623 --> 10:26.041
And she will feed,
and you will feed again.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.461
And that is the universe
as I've ordered it.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.631
So you, you wipe your nose...

10:33.800 --> 10:36.301
...and you leave me to grieve.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.062
Richards, what the hell
are you doing here?

10:49.024 --> 10:52.150
Not dead. Sorry.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.652
What are you trying
to accomplish?

10:53.737 --> 10:56.029
Amy's sick, you idiot.

10:56.073 --> 10:57.364
I miss the old days,

10:57.449 --> 10:59.366
when we hung people for treason.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.867
Just get us in the elevator.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.417
Unlock this.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.295
Good?

11:12.422 --> 11:13.797
Let's go. Come on.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.591
Hey. When you get down
to the cellblocks,

11:16.635 --> 11:18.821
make sure all the virals are
where they're supposed to be.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.303
Okay. Why?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.638
Just do it.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.325
And not just on the monitors,
all right?

11:23.392 --> 11:24.474
Get eyes on all of them.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.232
<i>How did she get out?</i>

11:32.317 --> 11:34.651
<i>I don't know.
Let's just bring her back in.</i>

11:34.736 --> 11:36.236
<i>Any signs of her?</i>

11:36.363 --> 11:37.737
Affirmative.
I got eyes on her.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.155
<i>Should I send backup,</i>

11:39.241 --> 11:41.449
<i>-just in case?</i>

11:41.493 --> 11:43.493
Let's not make this more
of a scene than it is.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.786
<i>- Okay, but, Clark...</i>
- I know.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.413
I've got this.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.257
Hang on a sec.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.092
No, you can't make me
go back there.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.386
All right, Shauna,
let's just talk.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.012
I hate this place!

12:03.098 --> 12:06.015
I keep having these nightmares!

12:06.101 --> 12:08.435
It's the same guy every time,

12:08.562 --> 12:10.061
and it's so real.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.522
We'll get you back to Dr. Sykes.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.982
She'll get you a prescription.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.943
There are no meds that can fix
what is happening to me.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.987
I just want
to get you back safe.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.284
There's
a 12-foot razor-wire fence

12:24.369 --> 12:26.745
surrounding the entire property,
you know.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.957
Snipers with M40 rifles could
pick you off at any moment.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.668
Then there's
the pressure pad sensors,

12:33.754 --> 12:36.546
infrared cameras,

12:36.631 --> 12:38.965
not to mention
the GPS chip in your neck.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.342
There's no way out.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.602
Please don't make me
go back there.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.657
Look,

13:04.785 --> 13:07.160
why don't we just go grab
a bite to eat?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.663
What?

13:18.799 --> 13:20.965
Grey shouldn't have clearance.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.885
Banks, do me a favor.

13:23.929 --> 13:26.095
Can you check on Lawrence Grey
in holding?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.224
Guns down!
Don't be stupid!

13:29.309 --> 13:30.809
Do what he says!

13:34.064 --> 13:36.397
- Get that door open.
- All right.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.024
Get it open now!

13:38.151 --> 13:40.360
- Where do you want these guys?
- Conference room.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.529
We'll be in the lab.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.696
Let's go. Follow.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.114
Go now.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.158
You, too.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.334
I have to take a second look
at these DNA sequences.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.425
These are Amy's vitals.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.095
Yeah, she's stable for now,
but there's no telling

14:07.222 --> 14:09.347
for how long.
As soon as I finish,

14:09.432 --> 14:12.058
I'll show you how to make up
an anti-viral infusion for her.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.185
Sure.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.690
Amy.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.693
Sweetheart.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.738
Can you hear me?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.285
Hi.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.830
How did you get in here?

14:33.957 --> 14:35.832
I told you, kiddo...

14:35.959 --> 14:38.543
I got skills.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.629
I found you.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.798
How you feeling?

14:43.884 --> 14:46.426
My head hurts.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.845
Okay.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.264
First, let's get you out
of these restraints

14:51.349 --> 14:53.308
and get you to the lab.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.851
No.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.603
No? What do you mean, no?

14:56.730 --> 14:59.731
It's too dangerous.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.697
Thanks for picking me up.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.115
Where you headed?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.534
Telluride.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.994
What about you?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.662
Same.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.497
Look at that.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.334
Must be some divine intervention
happening.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.681
I need eyes on Lawrence Grey
right now.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.017
He's not in his holding cell.
He's very dangerous.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.686
Um, why exactly
are we worried about Grey?

15:38.730 --> 15:39.812
He's a sweep.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.898
Just do what I asked you to do.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.697
...I got him, sir.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.325
West corridor, headed toward
the communications center.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.226
Grey!

16:20.855 --> 16:22.647
- You're too late!
- The hell are you doing?!

16:22.732 --> 16:24.357
What I was told to do.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.650
By Fanning?

16:25.735 --> 16:26.901
It's his show now.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.861
It's all his show now.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.530
- What's his plan?
- His plan

16:30.657 --> 16:32.198
is to change the world.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.575
We-we each had a job to do.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.371
What-what was it
Babcock asked you to do?

16:49.259 --> 16:51.467
It's insane that we're here.

16:52.595 --> 16:56.097
Being the boss has its perks.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.640
What can I get you?

16:57.767 --> 17:00.768
- I will be getting chicken fajitas and a burger.
- Okay.

17:00.895 --> 17:01.769
Don't judge.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.396
And a beer.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.648
And for you?

17:06.734 --> 17:08.192
Uh...

17:08.319 --> 17:10.862
stack of pancakes with, uh,

17:10.989 --> 17:13.281
bacon and a coffee.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.825
- Coming right up.
- Breakfast for dinner.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.996
You're an enigma,
Clark Richards.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.123
Oh, yeah?

17:21.207 --> 17:22.707
How's that?

17:22.791 --> 17:24.541
I mean, look at you.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.210
Got this coiffed hair,

17:26.296 --> 17:28.296
the posture, the gun.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.381
What senator made you?

17:30.467 --> 17:32.633
My dad's a judge, actually.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.135
So, yeah.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.846
Third Circuit, Court of Appeals.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.806
I have no idea what that means.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.725
It's a big deal.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.310
Federal.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.729
And you're the perfect son,
right?

17:44.814 --> 17:46.689
Always follows the rules.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.233
Joined up. Works for the Man.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.697
I'm the, uh...

17:54.783 --> 17:56.532
the black sheep, actually.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.576
My sister is, uh...

17:58.661 --> 18:01.162
is high up
in the Justice Department.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.372
My younger brother's
a brain surgeon.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.707
And I...

18:04.793 --> 18:06.459
Work at Project Noah,
babysitting me.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.960
Hey, tell me something real.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.962
Something you never say
out loud.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.714
Nothing mundane or basic, okay?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.341
Tell me who you are.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.392
I have a degree
in creative writing.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.936
- Mm.
- Fiction, mostly.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.938
A little poetry.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.731
Oh.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.108
Haikus?

18:30.193 --> 18:32.193
- Sonnets?
- Stop. Oh, stop.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.694
- Is it free verse?

18:33.822 --> 18:35.102
I thought this was a safe space.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.864
Limericks.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.908
And then I joined the Marines.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.077
And now I do this.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.705
There's a piece
of that story missing,

18:44.833 --> 18:46.624
but I'm gonna let it go.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.713
I'd read your poems.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.051
Oh, yeah?

18:57.137 --> 18:58.427
Yeah.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.555
If you wanted me to.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.104
The virus is just too smart.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.772
It embeds itself
in a target cell,

19:09.899 --> 19:11.190
and it replicates too fast.

19:11.276 --> 19:13.317
You can't slow it down?

19:13.403 --> 19:16.195
No. No, this is us
trying something else.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.781
If every virus has a key
and every target cell

19:18.867 --> 19:19.867
in our body has a lock...

19:19.951 --> 19:21.826
You want to change the locks.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.912
I know it's crazy, but
if you alter the target cell,

19:24.998 --> 19:26.998
then you've essentially locked
the virus out.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.041
But that won't reverse
Amy's symptoms.

19:29.085 --> 19:32.628
No. No, the abilities
and the immunity will remain.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.256
But if we can stop the virus
before it hits the limbic brain,

19:35.341 --> 19:36.924
she won't turn.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.595
It's a long shot.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.558
It's our only shot.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.775
You came back.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.110
What's happening to me?

19:56.196 --> 19:57.528
I don't feel right.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.530
You're turning, Amy.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.991
Pretty soon,
you'll be just like me.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.236
Though I have a hunch you'll
have Shauna Babcock's luck

20:04.287 --> 20:07.163
and get to keep
your pretty face.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.457
What about the feelings?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.501
I feel everyone in Project Noah.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.463
I'm feeling the agent right now.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.423
He's scared.

20:17.467 --> 20:21.344
That part doesn't go away,
I'm afraid.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.138
We're cursed to feel too much.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.641
But they don't all have
to be bad feelings, Amy.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.352
There's... good stuff, too.

20:34.692 --> 20:37.318
Good stuff like what?

20:44.494 --> 20:45.785
Why the hell does Lawrence Grey

20:45.828 --> 20:47.662
have unilateral security access?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.330
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.831
I'd never authorize that.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.583
Well, he destroyed
our communications hub,

20:52.669 --> 20:53.826
so someone authorized it.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.586
We're on an island out here.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.255
Thanks for that.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.901
Richards,
I would never give Lawrence Grey

20:58.925 --> 21:00.466
a security clearance.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.094
He gave Elizabeth Lear
the virus, for crying out loud.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.471
He should be in a cell
somewhere!

21:05.598 --> 21:07.518
While you were revoking
my clearance, he got out.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.645
Give me the codes.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.730
I need to override
the security system.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.565
I-I can't.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.110
Oh!

21:19.153 --> 21:21.195
I'm gonna need a better answer
than that.

21:21.322 --> 21:25.366
The DoD, they-they sent out
a new security advisor.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.827
He reset all the protocols
at my request.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.370
What's his name?

21:29.497 --> 21:30.955
Martinez.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.498
Where is he?

21:32.583 --> 21:34.917
He's upstairs. He's waiting
for his ride back to D.C.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.630
Ah.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.968
Uh, ow, ow. Y-You're hurting me,
you're hurting me.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.572
I need your retinas, Grey.
Or would you rather

21:45.596 --> 21:48.139
I just popped those eyeballs out
and leave you here instead?

21:48.266 --> 21:50.599
Oh, we should go.

21:55.773 --> 21:58.566
Hey. You're awake.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.735
- Hey.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.154
- You gotta let me untie you.
- No.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.115
Amy, I'm not afraid of you.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.742
I know you would never hurt me.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.455
- But I don't feel good.
- Okay. Okay.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.143
Let me call Dr. Sykes,
but you're gonna be fine.

22:14.167 --> 22:17.460
She's so close
to solving this thing.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.462
Can you hold on for me?

22:19.589 --> 22:22.089
What's wrong? What is it?

22:22.175 --> 22:24.216
Are you gonna throw up?

22:30.975 --> 22:32.391
What does that mean?

22:32.477 --> 22:34.060
Nothing.

22:34.145 --> 22:36.103
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.564
- Shh, shh, shh.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.691
Shh.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.037
What are we doing?

22:53.164 --> 22:54.663
I'm showing you what's possible.

22:54.749 --> 22:56.749
'Cause all those things
that you love,

22:56.834 --> 22:59.377
and all those things that make
you happy... they're still here.

22:59.462 --> 23:03.672
Being a viral doesn't
have to be scary or evil.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.925
It can also be magical.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.761
Winston hurt people.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.805
Uh-huh.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.724
I don't want to hurt people.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.684
I don't want to hurt the agent.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.603
Oh, you don't have to.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.605
We all get one, Amy.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.565
We all get to have
somebody else.

23:23.361 --> 23:25.820
And keep them with us forever.
He could be yours.

23:25.947 --> 23:29.490
Carter says I shouldn't believe
anything you say.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.492
And yet you still came
to see me.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.452
Why do you think that is?

23:35.832 --> 23:40.751
What do you say we enjoy this
beautiful day instead, huh?

23:42.588 --> 23:46.590
Hey, look at that.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.348
It's just like my old one.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.808
Yes, it is.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.941
Is this a trick?

24:04.026 --> 24:06.569
It's a bike, Amy.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.112
Come on.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.030
Even I couldn't ruin a bike.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.701
What do you say?

24:13.828 --> 24:15.494
Want to give this puppy a ride?

24:17.665 --> 24:19.498
Come on.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.459
<i>Saddle up, kid.</i>

24:23.463 --> 24:25.713
What's the blood for?

24:25.798 --> 24:29.216
When we finish the anti-viral,
we'll test it on her blood.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.051
Hope it does what we need it to.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.974
Sykes. She's burning up.

24:37.018 --> 24:39.288
<i>- Is there anything we can do?</i>
- She's getting what she needs

24:39.312 --> 24:41.112
from the IV for the moment,
but the anti-viral

24:41.147 --> 24:42.563
is the only thing
that can save her.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.444
Hey.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.071
Gotta keep the faith.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.157
She just has to hold on
a little bit longer.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.247
There's something else.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.041
She lost a tooth.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.963
Okay. She's in the turn.

25:08.090 --> 25:11.091
<i>There's nothing we can do
but keep moving forward.</i>

25:17.725 --> 25:20.768
But you never considered
bailing?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.811
Well, it's not like
I've packed my bags.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.177
All your black shirts and boots?

25:24.232 --> 25:26.065
But a couple of times, yeah.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.399
I've thought about it.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.943
So then why didn't you?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.694
Duty.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.780
You never quit until
the mission's complete.

25:32.907 --> 25:35.157
Yeah, but you said
how rough it is,

25:35.243 --> 25:37.326
how it eats away
at your humanity.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.954
That might have been the
excitement of my second coffee.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.665
Come on, man.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.668
You almost admitted to a
feeling. Don't walk it back.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.380
I know.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.507
- I'm super endearing.

25:51.592 --> 25:55.010
I'm not gonna lie. You are.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.682
I knew you were a good guy.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.141
Basically.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.589
But now I can see a little bit
of the poet underneath the...

26:07.066 --> 26:09.358
...military thing,
which is your armor.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.860
Like you're always ready
for an attack.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.657
The judge was a drunk.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.911
He'd laugh,

26:20.997 --> 26:23.163
make you feel like you're...

26:23.291 --> 26:25.708
his best friend in the world...

26:25.793 --> 26:30.129
and then... smack.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.675
I know that syndrome.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.225
Hey.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.770
We've been talking about me
this whole time.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.105
What's your story?

26:50.318 --> 26:53.360
Imagine if we got out of here
right now

26:53.487 --> 26:56.155
and then we never looked back.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.490
Shauna.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.790
You make enough mistakes,

27:06.876 --> 27:08.959
every idea you have
seems stupid.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.130
But you just never know, right?

27:13.215 --> 27:15.924
I mean, why bother otherwise?

27:24.560 --> 27:26.226
She's here.

27:26.354 --> 27:28.434
<i>Copy that, two-five.
Transport as soon as possible.</i>

27:31.692 --> 27:34.026
I didn't have a choice.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.906
You always have a choice, Clark.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.532
Always.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.664
Guess I'll tell you
my story another time.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.303
Fontes.

28:03.641 --> 28:06.558
You were in charge of logistics
when Guilder got here, right?

28:06.644 --> 28:09.561
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you know a Martinez,

28:09.605 --> 28:11.041
the security wonk you've been
working with?

28:11.065 --> 28:12.481
I met some of his uniforms,

28:12.608 --> 28:14.775
and a couple of body men,
but no suits.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.254
These were the guys he had
with him, right?

28:16.278 --> 28:18.278
- Yeah.
- Just uniforms?

28:18.364 --> 28:19.530
Yeah, why?

28:20.658 --> 28:22.032
I'm try...

28:22.159 --> 28:24.076
What'd I tell you
about the eyeballs?

28:27.873 --> 28:30.374
I'm trying to find this guy.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.000
Nobody's laid eyes on him.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.044
Well, maybe he's CIA.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.879
Sometimes you don't notice
those guys,

28:35.965 --> 28:37.965
even when they're right
in front of you.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.384
They're like ghosts.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.322
You're coming with me.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.998
This guy look familiar? Huh?

29:14.587 --> 29:17.212
Your security advisor is
a serial rapist and a murderer.

29:17.298 --> 29:18.839
And viral number two.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.883
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

29:29.685 --> 29:31.259
You just gonna leave him there?

29:31.353 --> 29:32.603
It's what he deserves.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.438
Let him think about
what he's done.

29:34.565 --> 29:37.858
So what do we do know?

29:37.943 --> 29:41.236
These virals have
designed the security protocols.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.655
They took
the communications down.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.949
We can thank Grey for that.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.951
These things are trying
to get out.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.662
Okay. So how do we stop them?

29:50.790 --> 29:53.540
Well, killing them's not
an option right now.

29:55.002 --> 29:57.002
I got an idea.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.554
And that won't go
into Amy's cell, right?

30:07.640 --> 30:09.431
That's right.

30:11.769 --> 30:14.728
All right.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.063
I'm gonna head upstairs.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.565
Non-essentials need to evacuate.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.275
I'll round up some people
I can trust.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.239
That's Grey's badge.

30:25.366 --> 30:27.115
Just in case.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.431
Do you ever think about
that night at the diner?

30:51.559 --> 30:52.724
Of course I do.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.560
You already know that.

30:54.645 --> 30:56.289
- Shauna, what's going on?
- Didn't it feel like

30:56.313 --> 30:58.689
- the beginning of something?
- Don't do this.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.858
You want a bloodbath?

31:00.943 --> 31:02.317
That's not who you are.

31:02.403 --> 31:05.612
Who I am is who you made me.

31:05.698 --> 31:08.490
You put me in a cage
and I want out.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.909
That's not happening.

31:10.995 --> 31:12.494
None of you are getting out.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.830
Sure we are.

31:14.874 --> 31:18.208
Because people like Grey
and Guilder and you help us.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.460
I'm not helping you.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.796
You stayed my execution.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.131
You killed Paulson.

31:24.258 --> 31:27.467
You lied to Nichole
about the dreams.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.678
Clark, you have helped me.

31:29.763 --> 31:33.140
Now, I'm saying this
for the last time.

31:33.267 --> 31:35.601
If you want safe passage,
you need me.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.906
You're right.

31:49.033 --> 31:51.617
I do care.

31:52.870 --> 31:57.748
But I don't care about you.

31:57.833 --> 32:01.960
I care about the Vegas girl
with the crappy life,

32:02.046 --> 32:05.088
the one who couldn't get a win
no matter how hard she tried.

32:05.174 --> 32:08.884
I care about the girl
from that diner.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.386
But you are not
that girl anymore.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.805
You are a monster.

32:13.933 --> 32:16.016
And if I get the chance,

32:16.101 --> 32:18.727
I will kill you.

32:25.069 --> 32:28.403
Tisdale, Smith,
round up anyone

32:28.447 --> 32:30.864
who isn't drunk or expecting
some imaginary bonus.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.991
I want soldiers
at every entrance and exit

32:33.118 --> 32:34.660
and the elevator to 4B.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.662
Those doors open,

32:36.747 --> 32:38.538
you see something
that doesn't look human,

32:38.666 --> 32:40.457
shoot to kill.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.125
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.823
If the anti-viral works,

33:54.908 --> 33:57.534
Amy's cells will block
Fanning's virus.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.244
We'll have done it.

33:59.329 --> 34:01.329
If not...

34:01.457 --> 34:03.498
No, don't even say it.

34:10.757 --> 34:14.259
Yes! Yes!

34:14.303 --> 34:16.511
Oh. Okay, so, um,

34:16.597 --> 34:18.638
now we-we-we prepare.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.514
- Um, we prepare a dosage for Amy.
- Right.

34:20.601 --> 34:23.009
- And then we duplicate it.
- Mm-hmm.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.228
We get it to the CDC.
I mean, this is...

34:25.313 --> 34:28.565
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.194
Oh, God.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.945
Oh, no.
Her fever's spiking.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.530
How long is it gonna take?

34:35.616 --> 34:37.114
Um, just a few minutes.

34:37.201 --> 34:39.784
Uh, do you have ice packs?
I need to cool her down.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.109
Yeah, down the hall. There's
a supply closet to the right.

35:01.892 --> 35:03.225
What?

35:06.396 --> 35:08.897
Grey! No!

35:08.982 --> 35:10.857
- No, Grey, no!

35:10.943 --> 35:12.943
No! No!

35:17.825 --> 35:19.366
I'm sorry.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.883
Grey, please. Please.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.260
Untie me, help me.

35:38.387 --> 35:40.846
Uh, I-I can't do that, sir.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.449
Of course you can.
It's an order. Do it!

35:42.516 --> 35:44.558
No, you'll-you'll-you'll be free
soon enough, sir.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.329
The hell does that mean?
What are you doing to me?

35:46.353 --> 35:47.936
I'm sorry to invade
your personal space,

35:48.063 --> 35:49.896
but I, um... I need that.

35:49.982 --> 35:51.731
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.461
Doesn't matter.
They're all asleep anyway.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.776
Not for long, sir.

35:54.862 --> 35:57.028
Please, son, don't do this!

35:57.114 --> 35:59.072
The thing is,

35:59.199 --> 36:02.576
I... I don't have a choice.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.997
And neither did you. No, no.

36:09.585 --> 36:11.793
Grey!

36:11.920 --> 36:13.837
You'll kill us all!

36:20.846 --> 36:23.430
What is this?

36:23.515 --> 36:26.766
This is something extraordinary

36:26.894 --> 36:28.810
and beautiful

36:28.896 --> 36:30.729
that only a few of us

36:30.856 --> 36:33.190
in the whole universe
have ever seen before.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.861
I don't feel good. I'm tired.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.905
I know you're tired.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.450
You're gonna feel better soon.

36:45.287 --> 36:47.287
Everything we've gone through
has led up

36:47.372 --> 36:49.289
to this moment in time.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.291
What do I have to do?

36:52.419 --> 36:54.461
You have to go through, Amy.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.630
You can come out the other side,

36:56.715 --> 36:58.965
and you're reborn as one of us,

36:59.092 --> 37:01.343
or you can die in that tunnel.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.396
She's fading. Where are you?

37:13.482 --> 37:15.065
Grey locked me in the lab.

37:15.192 --> 37:18.151
- What?
<i>- Richards is working on it.</i>

37:18.237 --> 37:20.570
What about Amy?
What happens if she...?

37:27.079 --> 37:30.664
At a certain point,
this is out of our hands.

37:30.791 --> 37:32.958
<i>With Carter and Elizabeth Lear,</i>

37:33.001 --> 37:35.293
<i>it-it became clear
that they had a choice to make.</i>

37:35.420 --> 37:38.129
What do you mean?
What kind of choice?

37:38.257 --> 37:41.341
To join Fanning
and become a viral or...

37:43.303 --> 37:45.637
Or what?

37:45.764 --> 37:48.223
Or die.

37:48.308 --> 37:51.559
<i>I know this is terribly
difficult, but I think...</i>

37:51.645 --> 37:55.313
I think we both know that she
doesn't want to be with Fanning.

38:00.988 --> 38:02.862
Okay.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.307
Hey.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.561
I know we made a promise
to each other.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.190
You don't leave me,
I don't leave you.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.862
<i>But if you come
to a fork in the road...</i>

38:45.324 --> 38:47.198
...you can break
your promise to me.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.496
If you have to...

38:55.709 --> 38:57.625
...you can let go.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.924
I love you, kid,

39:05.052 --> 39:06.926
no matter what.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.490
What are we not gonna do?

40:13.745 --> 40:15.662
Panic.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.708
Everyone says I'm special,

40:20.794 --> 40:23.128
but I'm afraid I'm a monster.

40:23.255 --> 40:25.630
I know who you are.

40:28.385 --> 40:30.885
You're like... the sun.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.887
<i>Your life is important.</i>

40:32.973 --> 40:34.222
<i>You are important.</i>

40:34.307 --> 40:36.182
You're wicked smart and strong

40:36.268 --> 40:38.852
and fast and funny and tough.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.230
You can do anything you want
with your life.

40:45.819 --> 40:48.528
- You just did that.
- I just did that.

40:48.655 --> 40:51.156
<i>You can do anything you want
with your life.</i>

40:51.241 --> 40:54.159
<i>That is not my opinion.
That is a fact.</i>

41:24.149 --> 41:25.440
Amy?

41:25.567 --> 41:27.025
What are you doing?

41:27.152 --> 41:29.527
Amy, don't do this. No!

41:33.867 --> 41:36.034
<i>Hey!</i>

41:52.969 --> 41:54.177
Hey you.

41:59.059 --> 42:01.184
- Amy.

42:02.395 --> 42:04.312
Hey, it's all right.

42:04.397 --> 42:05.855
We have to go.

42:22.374 --> 42:24.332
No. No. No!

42:24.459 --> 42:26.751
Here we go.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.424
Clark, the cages are open.

42:33.510 --> 42:35.426
Stay in the lab. Hide.
I'm on my way.

42:35.512 --> 42:38.012
Go to the armory. Get me
everything we have right now.

42:42.602 --> 42:44.227
Come on.

42:47.566 --> 42:49.065
Wolgast!
