00:00.281 --> 00:05.184
Oh, wow! This is beautiful!
Well, it has its drawbacks.

00:05.253 --> 00:07.187
Like what? Like that.

00:07.255 --> 00:08.688
Higgins.!

00:11.526 --> 00:14.154
Why would there be a Delta block
on a Marine M.I.A.?

00:14.228 --> 00:16.321
He didn't die. He's alive.

00:16.397 --> 00:19.662
- Let your mind reach out to him.
- Eric?

00:19.734 --> 00:21.133
Shh.!

00:21.158 --> 00:24.158
Delta Section wants him, Magnum.
It's up to him how we get him.

00:24.183 --> 00:27.005
I know what outfits like Delta Section
can do to men.

01:35.043 --> 01:38.137
- Think he'll be on time?
- I have no doubt he will.

01:38.213 --> 01:41.842
Yeah, but he's really been
running scared lately.

01:41.917 --> 01:44.181
Doesn't matter.
He's a Delta agent.

01:44.252 --> 01:46.948
His mental discipline
won't allow him to be late.

01:47.022 --> 01:49.547
I hope you're right. I am.

02:22.057 --> 02:24.252
- Tobin?
- What's the answer?

02:24.326 --> 02:28.228
- Now, Tobin, listen to me for a minute.
- Delta One said no. Is that the answer?

02:28.296 --> 02:30.890
The answer is...
I can't get an answer.

02:30.966 --> 02:32.763
No one can.

02:32.834 --> 02:36.270
There aren't more than three men in the
country that know Delta One's identity,

02:36.338 --> 02:38.932
and I'm not one of them.

02:39.007 --> 02:41.942
Now, Tobin, for God's sakes,
be reasonable.

02:42.010 --> 02:45.844
- There isn't such a word anymore, Newton.
- I know how you feel.

02:45.914 --> 02:50.283
You pencil-pushing...
How would you know?

02:50.352 --> 02:53.844
You ever been out there?
You ever had your cover blown?

02:53.922 --> 02:57.790
No, no, I haven't.
But listen to me. Now, just listen.

02:57.859 --> 02:59.884
You come in.

02:59.961 --> 03:03.954
I'll debrief you. That's the only way
I can set up a meeting with Delta One.

03:04.032 --> 03:07.695
The only man who's going
to debrief me is Delta One.

03:07.769 --> 03:10.602
Delta One.

03:27.188 --> 03:29.748
? Dena vu?

03:29.824 --> 03:31.758
Hey, Moki.

03:31.826 --> 03:36.320
? Could you be the dream
that I once knew?

03:40.368 --> 03:43.599
Who's that?
Her name's Laura Frasier.

03:43.671 --> 03:48.438
Rick hired her this morning. I guess he figured
we needed a little inspiration around here.

03:48.510 --> 03:52.776
? Could you be the dream
that might come true?

03:52.847 --> 03:56.806
?Shining through?

03:56.885 --> 04:01.015
? I keep remembering me?

04:01.089 --> 04:05.685
? I keep remembering you?

04:05.760 --> 04:10.527
? Ah?

04:13.068 --> 04:18.596
? DÃ©ja vu?

04:35.190 --> 04:37.920
- Laura!
- Eric.

04:39.694 --> 04:41.958
It's all right. It's okay.

04:42.030 --> 04:44.021
Come on. Drink this.

04:46.734 --> 04:48.395
Who are you?

04:48.470 --> 04:51.667
I'm Tom Magnum. I'm a friend of Rick's.
Shall I call a doctor?

04:51.739 --> 04:55.197
No! I'm... I'm all right.

04:55.276 --> 04:58.109
You're sure?

04:58.179 --> 05:00.477
Just felt a little faint, that's all.

05:00.548 --> 05:03.711
Who's Eric?

05:03.785 --> 05:06.549
You called his name
just before you came around.

05:06.621 --> 05:10.148
It's not important.

05:13.228 --> 05:16.288
Laura, are you all right?
What happened?

05:16.364 --> 05:18.423
I'm fine.
What are you doing here?

05:18.500 --> 05:21.060
Now, listen, don't mess around
with something like this. I mean...

05:21.069 --> 05:23.833
I'm all right, Rick. I promise.

05:23.905 --> 05:26.738
I just felt a little faint.

05:26.808 --> 05:31.609
Must be this stupid diet I've been on.
Guess it finally caught up with me.

05:31.679 --> 05:35.274
You just tell me what you want, and I'll have it here
in two minutes. Lickety-split, pronto, just like that.

05:35.350 --> 05:37.580
Some chicken soup.

05:37.652 --> 05:40.177
But I can fix it at home.
Don't worry about me.

05:40.255 --> 05:42.246
I'm fine. Chicken soup?

05:42.323 --> 05:44.604
You'll have a steak with vegetables
and all the trimmings.

05:44.626 --> 05:48.357
And I'll fix it at my place.
And a nice quiet swim goes with it.

06:07.282 --> 06:11.378
Oh, wow! This is beautiful!

06:11.452 --> 06:14.478
Well, it has its drawbacks.
Like what?

06:16.491 --> 06:18.925
Like that. Higgins!

06:21.763 --> 06:24.789
Zeus! Apollo! Halt! Higgins.!

06:24.866 --> 06:27.198
Enough is enough.

06:27.268 --> 06:30.066
Those dogs are beginning to
make me lose my sense of humor.

06:30.138 --> 06:33.130
Thanks to this young lady,
that's all you're losing today.

06:33.208 --> 06:37.269
I'm sorry, miss, if the lads frightened
you, but security here is quite stringent.

06:37.345 --> 06:39.575
We're just here
to have a swim and dinner.

06:39.647 --> 06:43.344
Just a swim and dinner.

06:45.653 --> 06:47.621
Carry on then.

07:02.103 --> 07:05.903
Aren't you gonna get wet?
Maybe later.

07:05.974 --> 07:08.442
This is beautiful.

07:08.509 --> 07:10.534
How'd you know
this is just what I needed?

07:10.612 --> 07:14.275
Oh, it's just a hunch.
Do you get hunches often?

07:14.349 --> 07:18.285
No, but when I do, I usually
go with them. How about you?

07:21.256 --> 07:23.986
You asked me who Eric is, remember?
Yeah.

07:24.058 --> 07:29.360
Well, our families lived next door to one
another in Webster Groves, Missouri.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.398
Eric and I grew up together.

07:32.734 --> 07:37.467
We always knew what the other one was
going to say even before we said it.

07:37.538 --> 07:42.635
We even knew what the other one was
thinking or what the other needed.

07:42.710 --> 07:44.644
Some people call that E.S.P.

07:44.712 --> 07:47.840
And some people just
laughed at you if you say that.

07:47.915 --> 07:50.213
No, I'm not laughing.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.980
No, you weren't.

07:57.292 --> 08:00.557
Anyway,

08:00.628 --> 08:06.362
Eric and I were engaged in college,
but before we could be married,

08:06.434 --> 08:09.062
Eric joined the Marine Corps
and was sent to Vietnam.

08:09.137 --> 08:14.074
And in 1972, in August,

08:14.142 --> 08:18.636
he had an R & R here
in Honolulu at Fort DeRussy,

08:18.713 --> 08:21.807
and I joined him.

08:21.883 --> 08:25.876
A couple of weeks later, I was back
in Missouri, and he was back in 'Nam.

08:29.190 --> 08:32.250
And the Marine Corps
notified his mother that...

08:32.327 --> 08:35.626
he was missing in action.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.732
She finally gave him up for dead, but...

08:43.804 --> 08:45.796
see, I knew he was alive.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.535
I just knew it.

08:48.609 --> 08:52.943
Then about a month ago, I saw him.

08:53.014 --> 08:55.448
Where? In my head.

08:55.516 --> 08:57.814
Just like today.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.716
When you passed out?

09:03.191 --> 09:05.989
He's in something.
Somewhere up high.

09:06.060 --> 09:10.690
I can't make it out, but he's got a rifle,
and he's shooting at someone.

09:10.765 --> 09:15.327
And then he's falling. He just keeps falling
and falling like he's been shot into the sea.

09:15.403 --> 09:17.166
Anything else?

09:17.238 --> 09:22.835
Just that when that happened, I had this
feeling that he was here in Honolulu.

09:22.910 --> 09:26.368
So you came out here looking for him.

09:26.447 --> 09:28.608
Yes. No luck?

09:28.683 --> 09:33.518
The Marine Corps won't tell me anything
because I'm not related to Eric.

09:33.588 --> 09:36.182
Well, maybe I can help.

09:36.257 --> 09:41.160
- You mean that?
- Laura, I am a private investigator.

09:41.229 --> 09:43.493
I don't know what to say.

09:43.564 --> 09:45.964
Why don't you get wet?
Come on. Let's go for a swim.

09:46.033 --> 09:48.160
Come on.

09:48.236 --> 09:52.798
We'll go for a swim,
and then we'll have some dinner.

09:55.476 --> 09:57.410
Come on!

10:09.357 --> 10:11.587
I started working on the case
the next morning,

10:11.659 --> 10:13.593
if you could call it a case.

10:13.661 --> 10:17.119
Laura had hired me to confirm
that Eric was actually missing in action.

10:17.198 --> 10:21.191
It wasn't a big deal if you had access
to the computers at Pearl, but I didn't.

10:21.269 --> 10:27.003
However, Lieutenant MacReynolds did,
and I had a feeling he'd help me out.

10:27.074 --> 10:29.201
Get lost, Magnum.
The answer is no.

10:29.277 --> 10:32.212
Okay, MacReynolds, you're not
the only friend I've got on this base.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.078
Magnum, you're about as popular
around here as Legionnaires' Disease.

10:35.149 --> 10:37.743
Yeah? Well, that'll change soon.
What do you mean by that?

10:37.819 --> 10:39.753
Admiral Sturdevant.

10:39.821 --> 10:41.755
Admiral Sturdevant? Yeah.

10:41.823 --> 10:45.759
He's being transferred out here
from Washington to take over CI NCPAC.

10:45.827 --> 10:48.421
Now, how do you know that?

10:48.496 --> 10:52.830
Well, Admiral Sturdevant and I
were real tight in 'Nam. We still are.

10:52.900 --> 10:56.427
He sent me a letter saying
that he'd be seeing me soon.

10:56.504 --> 11:01.567
It's funny. I guess I have a lot
of leverage with Old Iron Pants.

11:01.642 --> 11:05.476
Old Iron Pants?
That's what his buddies call him.

11:05.546 --> 11:07.480
Magnum, you're conning me.

11:07.548 --> 11:09.539
Hey, if that's what you
want to think, it's fine.

11:09.617 --> 11:14.316
It's not a problem.
M-M-Magnum, come back.

11:16.190 --> 11:20.024
I know you're conning me. Aw, come on, Mac.
just push the buttons.

11:20.094 --> 11:23.029
What's the name?
Tobin. Eric Tobin.

11:32.707 --> 11:36.609
He's still missing in action, okay?
Hey, you can't do that!

11:40.648 --> 11:43.515
- A Delta block?
- That's it, Magnum.

11:43.584 --> 11:45.916
Why would there be a Delta block
on a Marine M.I.A.?

11:45.987 --> 11:48.182
I don't know, I don't care,
and neither do you.

11:48.256 --> 11:50.656
Just get out of here
and keep your damn mouth shut.

11:50.725 --> 11:54.024
If you show up here again, I'm gonna
have to take you to security, okay?

12:01.401 --> 12:04.268
- His file was blocked by Delta Section.
- Well, who are they?

12:04.337 --> 12:06.897
It's a spook outfit.
Nobody knows much about 'em.

12:06.973 --> 12:09.737
Nobody wants to,
considering the kind of work they do.

12:09.809 --> 12:11.743
Such as?

12:13.813 --> 12:17.180
Such as sabotage,
terrorism, assassination.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.684
Eric couldn't have been
a part of anything like that.

12:19.752 --> 12:23.051
Laura, his file has
what they call a Delta lock on it.

12:23.122 --> 12:25.090
Well, there must be
some mistake.

12:25.158 --> 12:28.650
Delta Section doesn't make mistakes.

12:28.728 --> 12:31.891
Not that kind anyway.

12:31.965 --> 12:35.662
But why would it be on his file?

12:35.735 --> 12:39.398
Either Delta Section wants
someone to think he's dead...

12:39.472 --> 12:41.804
Or?

12:41.874 --> 12:44.342
Or it doesn't want anyone
to know how he died.

12:44.410 --> 12:47.072
But he didn't die! Laura.

12:47.146 --> 12:50.206
He's alive right here in Honolulu.
I know it!

12:50.283 --> 12:53.844
Attention, all military personnel
leaving for Hickam Field,

12:53.920 --> 12:56.115
the bus will depart in 10 minutes.

12:56.189 --> 12:58.453
Eric and I said good-bye there.

13:01.527 --> 13:04.519
Laura, you know, sometimes a person
can want something so much...

13:04.597 --> 13:06.531
they really can't see the truth.

13:09.102 --> 13:11.730
I can still remember the date.

13:11.804 --> 13:15.205
August 8, 1972.

13:15.274 --> 13:18.835
July 15th, 1967.

13:18.911 --> 13:21.539
A lot of people said good-bye there.

13:24.617 --> 13:26.847
Were you in love with her?

13:30.390 --> 13:32.722
Yes, as a matter of fact, I was.

13:52.278 --> 13:54.405
Maybe you were right.

13:54.480 --> 13:59.042
Maybe I do want Eric to be alive so badly
that I'm just not facing reality.

13:59.118 --> 14:01.678
Laura, don't be that hard on yourself.

14:01.754 --> 14:04.917
The important thing is
just to face that possibility.

14:04.991 --> 14:07.858
But we're gonna keep on looking.

14:07.927 --> 14:11.590
M-A-G-N-U-M.

14:14.967 --> 14:18.027
And who's the girl?

14:18.104 --> 14:21.198
Laura Frasier?

14:23.643 --> 14:25.577
Okay.

14:40.359 --> 14:43.123
It won't work, Magnum.

14:43.196 --> 14:46.222
But you said you'd done it before. Yes,
but those were merely parlor tricks.

14:46.299 --> 14:50.133
Things I picked up
while serving in India in '48.

14:50.203 --> 14:55.641
Of course, it did work when
my sister lost the family brooch.

14:55.708 --> 14:59.508
I put her into a trance,
and she remembered leaving it in the...

15:00.980 --> 15:06.145
Well, it's not important where she left it, is it? The important
thing is that under trance she did remember where she left it.

15:06.219 --> 15:08.881
Then you'll give it a try with Laura.

15:10.990 --> 15:13.220
- The Ferrari.
- The Ferrari?

15:13.292 --> 15:15.226
As long as you're utilizing the vehicle,

15:15.294 --> 15:18.422
you should at least be responsible
for its upkeep. Well, I am.

15:18.498 --> 15:21.990
I have the tires checked regularly.
I added a quart of oil just the other day.

15:22.068 --> 15:24.195
How extravagantly decent of you.

15:24.270 --> 15:28.104
Magnum, the car is overdue for servicing.

15:28.174 --> 15:30.199
For servicing?

15:30.276 --> 15:32.574
You mean you want me
to get a tune-up?

15:32.645 --> 15:35.512
Precisely.

15:35.581 --> 15:38.414
Is that all?

15:38.484 --> 15:41.078
That's all.

15:41.154 --> 15:43.088
Higgins.

15:43.122 --> 15:45.818
Higgins, how much does a tune-up cost?

15:47.126 --> 15:50.095
Higgins, how much does
a Ferrari tune-up cost?

15:54.066 --> 15:56.694
Sleep.

15:56.769 --> 16:01.206
Deep, deep sleep.

16:01.274 --> 16:04.266
The colors wash through you,

16:04.343 --> 16:07.540
refreshing your body,
refreshing your mind.

16:07.613 --> 16:11.413
So soft, so warm, so gentle.

16:11.484 --> 16:15.215
You hear only my voice,
so nothing disturbs you.

16:15.288 --> 16:19.554
Sleep, sleep.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.559
Sleep.

16:21.627 --> 16:23.891
- Is she?
- Shh!

16:27.967 --> 16:30.595
Can you hear me, Laura?

16:30.670 --> 16:32.638
Yes.

16:32.705 --> 16:34.673
When I count three,

16:34.740 --> 16:39.734
you will open your eyes
and look into the crystal.

16:39.812 --> 16:44.875
One, two, three.

16:46.285 --> 16:49.618
Look carefully.
Eric is in there.

16:49.689 --> 16:53.022
Let your mind reach out to him.

16:57.797 --> 16:59.731
Eric!

17:02.068 --> 17:04.093
Laura, do you see him?

17:05.905 --> 17:08.099
Yes.

17:08.174 --> 17:10.267
He's up high...

17:11.844 --> 17:14.404
with a rifle.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.280
He's shooting. He's falling!

17:18.351 --> 17:19.784
No! Laura.!

17:19.852 --> 17:21.877
Eric is not in the crystal now.
He's gone.

17:21.954 --> 17:26.152
All there is is snow. Just falling snow.
Soft flakes of snow.

17:29.362 --> 17:31.353
Now, close your eyes.

17:35.801 --> 17:38.292
I told you it wouldn't work.
It was working. She saw Eric.

17:38.371 --> 17:42.740
She only saw what she says she sees
when she faints. Nothing more.

17:44.644 --> 17:47.204
When I count to three, you'll awake.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.805
You will feel very calm,
very refreshed,

17:49.882 --> 17:53.818
as if you've had a nice long sleep.

17:53.886 --> 17:58.448
One, two, three.

18:01.527 --> 18:03.461
Well?

18:04.997 --> 18:07.488
I don't know, Thomas.
I don't think this is gonna work.

18:07.566 --> 18:10.194
Oh, come on, T.C.
You're a good mechanic.

18:10.269 --> 18:12.203
Hah!

18:12.271 --> 18:15.468
On helicopters, I'm king.
Jeeps, I'm unbeatable.

18:15.541 --> 18:19.841
But, man, there's so much unnecessary junk
up under these things.

18:19.912 --> 18:23.006
Unnecessary junk?

18:23.082 --> 18:26.142
T.C., a spark plug is a spark plug.

18:26.218 --> 18:28.152
You'll do a great job.

18:29.555 --> 18:31.523
Okay.

18:33.059 --> 18:35.527
I guess I'll need a ball peen hammer.

18:35.594 --> 18:37.824
Throw it here.

18:46.138 --> 18:49.198
Okay, fire her up.

19:05.524 --> 19:07.253
That's great. You did it.

19:07.326 --> 19:10.557
Well, never doubted it for a minute.

19:10.629 --> 19:14.190
- Hey, you're a genius.
- Yeah, well...

19:14.266 --> 19:19.294
- That'll be fifty bucks.
- Fifty bucks? What for?

19:19.372 --> 19:22.773
Well, there's something
known as parts, man.

19:22.842 --> 19:26.107
Fifty bucks for spark plugs?
Come on! That's right.

19:26.178 --> 19:28.203
Look, I gotta run.
I'll see you this afternoon.

19:28.280 --> 19:32.307
It's Friday, Thomas. I need the 50 bucks
to buy a fuel pump for my chopper.

19:32.385 --> 19:34.478
Well, all I got's a 20.

19:36.655 --> 19:39.453
All right, man. That'll
do for right now. T.C.!

19:39.525 --> 19:41.459
You mean you'd let me
drive out of here broke?

19:41.527 --> 19:44.223
Well, that's the way
you always drive in.

19:44.296 --> 19:46.230
The money, Thomas.

19:46.298 --> 19:49.426
Okay, I tell you what I'll do.
I'll loan you 10 till this evening.

19:49.502 --> 19:51.732
You'll loan me 10?
You owe me 50!

19:51.804 --> 19:55.262
That's right, which I don't have.
So I'll loan you 10 to keep you afloat.

19:55.341 --> 19:57.673
You can pay me back
when I pay you the 50.

19:57.743 --> 19:59.904
Whoa.! What's with this
Abbott and Costello routine?

19:59.979 --> 20:03.471
You owe me 50, you'll loan me 10?
Forget it!

20:03.549 --> 20:06.712
Oh, okay. Thanks. I owe you one.

20:06.786 --> 20:09.983
You owe me one? You owe me 50!

20:16.796 --> 20:19.856
- Hello?
- I saw the sign. What do you want?

20:19.932 --> 20:23.197
I thought you might like to know
Laura Frasier's in Honolulu.

20:23.269 --> 20:26.670
She's singing at the King Kamehameha Club
in the afternoon.

20:26.739 --> 20:29.333
Spends the rest of her
time looking for you.

20:29.408 --> 20:33.674
Oh, and I guess you should know
one of our agents is protecting her.

20:54.099 --> 20:59.093
Pat, don't ever give work
to your friends.

20:59.171 --> 21:01.139
Ever.

21:21.694 --> 21:23.924
Hey, Moki, is Laura in her dressing room?

21:23.996 --> 21:27.397
Yeah, but you got yourself a visitor.
He's up on Rick's terrace.

21:27.466 --> 21:30.060
Who is he?
Well, his name's Newton.

21:30.135 --> 21:32.501
He says he works for
a tourist agency.

21:32.571 --> 21:36.632
Rick told me to tell you five will
get you ten he's government heat.

21:36.709 --> 21:38.677
Government heat, huh?

21:43.849 --> 21:46.317
Magnum? That's right.

21:48.287 --> 21:51.085
Can I order you a drink?

21:51.156 --> 21:54.319
No, thanks. Thanks, Sandy.

21:58.030 --> 21:59.964
You're from Delta Section, right?

22:00.032 --> 22:03.058
Assistant chief of personnel.

22:03.135 --> 22:06.434
I take it you have a rather jaundiced
impression of Delta Section.

22:06.505 --> 22:09.997
Why don't you knock off the phony bull,
Newton, and get to the point?

22:10.075 --> 22:12.236
Right.

22:12.311 --> 22:14.939
I understand you're looking
for a man named Eric Tobin...

22:15.014 --> 22:17.141
and you're working
for a woman named Laura Frasier.

22:17.216 --> 22:19.684
- Next question's why.
- Yes.

22:19.752 --> 22:23.848
Only that's my question.
Why are you looking for Tobin?

22:23.923 --> 22:27.620
- I didn't say I was.
- You wouldn't be here if you weren't.

22:27.693 --> 22:29.627
Tobin isn't an M.I.A.

22:29.695 --> 22:34.189
He's alive, he's in Honolulu,
and he's a Delta agent.

22:34.266 --> 22:37.292
Now, even if that were true,
I wouldn't tell you.

22:37.369 --> 22:39.860
That'd be top secret information
and you know that.

22:42.141 --> 22:44.939
Top secret information. Right.

22:45.010 --> 22:48.537
You guys live on a one-way street.
All questions and no answers.

22:48.614 --> 22:52.482
Till you misplaced one of your agents,
then you come to me for help.

22:52.551 --> 22:55.952
Well, go suck an egg, Newton. I wouldn't
give you the directions to Diamond Head.

23:02.127 --> 23:06.621
You know, Magnum, finding Tobin
is a matter of national security.

23:06.699 --> 23:09.224
As a former N.I.A. officer...

23:09.301 --> 23:12.896
Don't wave the flag at me, Newton!
I served!

23:18.110 --> 23:21.944
Besides, I'm not so sure helping Delta Section
is in the best interests of the country.

23:22.014 --> 23:25.711
Now, if you want to fill me in, fine.
Otherwise...

23:26.952 --> 23:30.820
Well, here's my telephone number...

23:30.889 --> 23:34.086
in case you change your mind.

23:38.097 --> 23:41.396
You guys really want him dead,
don't you?

23:41.467 --> 23:43.594
Delta Section wants him, Magnum.

23:43.669 --> 23:46.001
It's up to him how we get him.

23:54.313 --> 23:57.111
In his letter, Mr. Masters
enumerates several points...

23:57.182 --> 23:59.480
which he feels the board of directors
should address.

24:01.553 --> 24:04.454
- Point one is...
- How you doing, Higgins?

24:06.558 --> 24:09.550
Let me proceed to point 10,

24:09.628 --> 24:12.995
which concerns itself with
the increasing number of nonmembers...

24:13.065 --> 24:15.295
who are using the club.

24:33.218 --> 24:35.311
Laura?

24:38.791 --> 24:40.588
Laura, are you all right?

24:47.633 --> 24:51.865
Thomas. Thomas, he's here.

24:51.937 --> 24:55.100
Here? In the club?
Yes, and somewhere very close.

24:55.174 --> 24:57.108
Come on.

25:05.617 --> 25:08.381
Eric!

25:22.534 --> 25:26.561
Magnum, this is outrageous!

25:35.714 --> 25:39.081
- No! Stay down!
- What's going on?

25:54.150 --> 25:56.084
Eric saw it was me.
Why would he run?

25:56.152 --> 25:58.177
I don't know, Laura.
Which one was it, Pat?

25:58.254 --> 26:00.916
It's the black Mustang. He said he was
here to meet a member. I didn't know.

26:00.990 --> 26:04.426
It's not your fault. Don't worry about it.
Magnum, I want to talk to you.

26:04.494 --> 26:08.328
No. Later, Higgins.
Now! This not a hotel street saloon.

26:08.397 --> 26:11.230
It's the most exclusive club in Honolulu,
and your behavior is intolerable.

26:11.300 --> 26:14.133
My behavior? I wasn't the one
doing the shooting, Higgins.

26:14.203 --> 26:16.137
Whoever was
is not a member of this club.

26:16.205 --> 26:18.833
Well, neither am I.
My point precisely.

26:18.908 --> 26:22.708
I want you to take immediate steps
to see that Magnum leaves the premises.

26:22.778 --> 26:24.439
Wait. He's your guest.

26:24.514 --> 26:26.448
My guest? Well, Robin Masters's.

26:26.516 --> 26:30.008
And you're Robin's surrogate to the board of
directors, so technically, he's your guest.

26:34.624 --> 26:36.558
Thanks, pal. Anytime.

26:36.626 --> 26:38.560
Can you do me one more favor, Rick?
You got it.

26:38.628 --> 26:40.596
Can you take Laura inside
and keep an eye out on her?

26:40.663 --> 26:42.631
I mean, this guy's still out
there somewhere. Thomas, I...

26:42.698 --> 26:46.828
Look, you go inside with Rick.
Please? I'll see you later.

26:46.903 --> 26:50.202
Okay. Thank you.

26:50.273 --> 26:52.207
Is this the one, Pat? Yeah.

26:52.275 --> 26:54.266
Thanks.

27:01.250 --> 27:04.981
The car had been sanitized.
No registration, nothing.

27:11.861 --> 27:16.195
Or almost nothing.
Eric had been careless.

27:16.265 --> 27:20.065
He'd left a claim check from
a parking lot on Moana Street,

27:20.136 --> 27:22.468
and the date was for today.

27:24.874 --> 27:27.240
The guy minding the lot
had some information,

27:27.310 --> 27:30.040
which he wanted 25 bucks for.

27:30.112 --> 27:33.275
I haggled him down to 20,
which was all I had.

27:33.349 --> 27:36.477
See? I hadn't been lying to T.C.

27:49.799 --> 27:53.667
The building was abandoned.
It was a perfect place to hide.

28:04.247 --> 28:09.310
Eric had made a mistake
leaving that parking stub in the car.

28:09.385 --> 28:12.377
And in this business,
mistakes are usually fatal.

29:57.026 --> 30:01.258
The letter to the Washington Post
was to be mailed in case of Eric's death.

30:01.330 --> 30:04.891
According to Eric, he was part of
a four-man Delta rescue team...

30:04.967 --> 30:08.459
operating out of a small
North African village called Rabal.

30:08.537 --> 30:11.904
Since only Delta One
knew of the team's existence,

30:11.974 --> 30:16.274
theoretically only Delta One
could have blown their cover.

30:57.119 --> 30:59.610
Hi, Rick. Will you do me a favor?
Sure.

30:59.688 --> 31:01.781
I need the address that
goes with this phone number.

31:01.857 --> 31:05.020
Fast, I bet, huh? Well, like yesterday.
Where's Laura?

31:05.094 --> 31:08.461
She's in her dressing room.
I wouldn't even let her sing.

31:14.804 --> 31:17.238
Laura?

31:23.312 --> 31:25.712
He was here again, wasn't he?

31:29.718 --> 31:34.621
He came to tell me
to forget him, to go home.

31:36.525 --> 31:39.790
Thomas, you should have seen him.

31:39.862 --> 31:42.023
He was so cold.

31:42.097 --> 31:46.693
His eyes and his hands
when he touched me.

31:50.473 --> 31:53.033
Hey, it's okay to cry.

31:53.108 --> 31:55.508
It's okay.

32:02.585 --> 32:06.043
I haven't cried for eight years,
you know.

32:09.492 --> 32:14.589
It would be like...
admitting he was dead.

32:28.811 --> 32:31.371
I realize now that...

32:33.182 --> 32:36.549
you don't have to have
someone die to lose them.

32:38.721 --> 32:41.713
Thomas, it's over now.

32:41.790 --> 32:44.850
Promise me you'll let it go.

32:44.927 --> 32:48.192
Laura, I don't think they'll let us.

33:09.184 --> 33:11.118
What do you want, Newton?

33:11.186 --> 33:13.620
We're taking Miss Frasier
into protective custody.

33:13.689 --> 33:15.088
Like hell you are.

33:15.157 --> 33:17.785
I warned you.
This is a national security matter.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.851
I don't care what it is.

33:22.464 --> 33:25.524
It's all right.
Just stay in the car.

33:31.173 --> 33:34.768
I have a warrant, Magnum.
Then let's see it.

33:34.843 --> 33:37.175
Thomas.!

33:44.153 --> 33:46.621
I thought for a moment
about going to 5-0,

33:46.689 --> 33:48.680
then realized Delta Section
would have that angle covered...

33:48.757 --> 33:53.456
with a great big cloak called
"national security. '".

33:53.529 --> 33:56.760
No. The only way to save Laura
was to play Delta's kind of game,

33:56.832 --> 34:00.996
and to do that,
I needed more information.

34:01.070 --> 34:06.167
So I reenlisted,
only I didn't bother telling the navy.

34:06.241 --> 34:08.902
You might say I was
officer of the day.

34:27.262 --> 34:30.697
My luck was holding.
The computer room was nearly empty.

34:30.766 --> 34:32.699
Now all I had to get
was the code number...

34:32.768 --> 34:36.204
for Delta Section's
classified personnel file.

34:46.681 --> 34:49.446
Even though it was classified,
it wasn't top secret,

34:49.518 --> 34:52.146
so it wasn't Class ""A" protected.

35:25.988 --> 35:28.456
Magnum!
MacReynolds, don't scare me like that.

35:28.524 --> 35:30.458
What the hell are you doing in here?

35:30.526 --> 35:33.461
"" Delta Section classified personnel."
You've got no right to be looking at that!

35:33.529 --> 35:36.191
Come on, Mac. It's not even secret.
It's just classified.

35:36.265 --> 35:38.665
It's for authorized use, and
you're not authorized. Mac!

35:38.734 --> 35:41.965
And look at that uniform.
You got no right to be wearing a uniform.

35:42.037 --> 35:43.800
Look at your hair.
You look ridiculous.

35:43.872 --> 35:46.397
- I warned you I was gonna do this.
- Mac, don't...

35:46.475 --> 35:51.503
Put down the phone. Just put it down
and listen to me. This is about Tobin.

35:51.580 --> 35:54.940
And yesterday was about some admiral named
Iron Pants that's gonna take over CI NCPAC.

35:54.950 --> 35:57.578
This is about Eric Tobin,
the M.I.A., remember?

35:57.653 --> 36:00.850
Look, he's a Delta agent.
He thinks Delta One blew his cover.

36:00.923 --> 36:04.359
Now, he may be right, he may be wrong, but
either way he's in Honolulu to kill him.

36:04.426 --> 36:06.986
He could take out a lot of
innocent people in the process.

36:07.062 --> 36:10.429
- Magnum, if you're conning me again...
- Mac, I've been down that road.

36:10.499 --> 36:14.230
Not all the way, but far enough to know what
outfits like Delta Section can do to men.

36:15.604 --> 36:18.698
Look, believe me,
he'll kill whoever gets in his way.

36:23.145 --> 36:25.579
Well, okay, but if anybody finds
you in here, Thanks, pal.

36:25.647 --> 36:28.309
I'm gonna be walking the shortest
plank in the history of the navy.

36:28.383 --> 36:30.317
Thank you.

36:31.386 --> 36:34.685
- There he is.
- Newton?

36:36.258 --> 36:39.659
- Look at Newton's code number.
- What about it?

36:39.728 --> 36:42.094
Well, that's the highest
I've seen so far.

36:42.164 --> 36:46.430
What's that mean to you?
That he just joined Delta Section.

36:46.502 --> 36:51.565
According to his readout, he's been counting
paper clips with Delta Section since '65.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.803
He should have one of the lowest code
numbers, not one of the highest, right?

36:54.877 --> 36:58.870
Mm-hmm. Doesn't make sense.

36:58.947 --> 37:01.245
Unless...

37:01.350 --> 37:04.319
it was put in his file recently...

37:05.387 --> 37:07.321
as a cover.

37:16.565 --> 37:20.399
- Hello. - You're getting mighty
talkative, Newton. You lonesome?

37:20.469 --> 37:23.267
I got it. A meeting with Delta One.

37:23.338 --> 37:25.272
Did you hear me?

37:25.340 --> 37:27.570
I heard you. I'm trying to decide
if I believe you.

37:27.643 --> 37:29.543
I managed to make contact.

37:29.611 --> 37:31.772
He'll be arriving in Honolulu at 9:00.

37:31.847 --> 37:35.180
He said you could pick the place for the
meeting. Doesn't that reassure you?

37:38.020 --> 37:42.389
The abandoned dredge
opposite the reef runway, 8:00.

37:42.457 --> 37:44.448
Just the two of you.

37:50.566 --> 37:53.399
Is Rick in his office? Yeah.

37:54.469 --> 37:56.403
Hey, T.C., you're just the man
I want to see.

37:56.471 --> 37:58.496
Have you got that address for me, Rick?
I'll have it for you in a second.

37:58.574 --> 38:01.134
I been waiting for you. Or more accurately,
I been waiting for my 50 bucks.

38:01.210 --> 38:03.804
What for?
That Ferrari runs like an old washtub.

38:03.879 --> 38:06.643
I told you I wasn't the one
to fix your old washtub.

38:06.715 --> 38:09.775
But you still owe me 50 bucks
for the spark plugs.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.945
T.C., I'll need your van.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.181
My what?

38:14.256 --> 38:18.283
I mean, you already owe me 50 bucks,
which you aren't gonna pay me already.

38:18.360 --> 38:22.091
And you want to borrow my van?
No way.

38:22.164 --> 38:25.656
- Please, T.C. This is important.
- Yeah, it's always important.

38:25.734 --> 38:28.134
I'm not kidding, T.C. Honest.

38:36.211 --> 38:39.203
Thanks. I owe you one.
Thanks, Rick.

38:40.849 --> 38:44.512
Has it ever occurred to you
that boy cannot count past one?

39:03.238 --> 39:05.172
Shall we talk in your office?

39:05.240 --> 39:07.572
Why not?

39:14.583 --> 39:16.517
Go to your desk, sit down,

39:16.585 --> 39:19.213
put your hands
where I can see them.

39:26.328 --> 39:28.262
The hands.

39:31.466 --> 39:34.833
- What do you want, Magnum?
- Laura Frasier.

39:34.903 --> 39:37.895
And you're gonna give her to me,
or Delta One is gonna be dead...

39:37.973 --> 39:40.407
long before Tobin ever
takes a shot at him.

39:40.475 --> 39:44.070
What are you talking about?

39:44.146 --> 39:47.582
You, Newton. You're Delta One.

39:47.649 --> 39:51.949
See, I read a letter that Tobin wrote
to the Washington Post...

39:52.020 --> 39:55.012
in case you got him before he got you.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.024
And then I took a look
at your personnel file.

39:57.092 --> 40:02.792
You've been in the outfit since '65,
and you've got a 1981 serial number.

40:06.735 --> 40:08.669
That's very good.

40:08.737 --> 40:12.002
Thank you. Where's Laura?

40:13.942 --> 40:17.571
Newton, I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

40:17.646 --> 40:19.671
and then I'm gonna blow your brains
out the window.

40:20.849 --> 40:24.341
- Where's the letter to the Post?
- I got it.

40:24.419 --> 40:28.617
You give me the letter.
I'll give you Laura.

40:28.690 --> 40:33.684
No. You give me Laura,
and then I give you the letter.

40:33.762 --> 40:38.859
That's the way it works this time
because I've got the warrant.

40:51.079 --> 40:54.537
- It's all right.
- Tell him to put the rifle down now.

40:54.616 --> 40:56.743
Put the rifle down.

41:04.593 --> 41:06.891
All right, you know the routine.

41:33.622 --> 41:36.750
All right, get out of here.
Come on, Laura.

41:41.229 --> 41:44.824
Eric's on that barge over there.

42:11.526 --> 42:13.960
They want me to talk to him.

42:14.029 --> 42:16.862
You've got to get him to come in,
or they'll kill him.

42:20.502 --> 42:24.404
You were gonna use her to divert
his attention? Maybe even his fire?

42:24.473 --> 42:28.432
What I was or wasn't gonna do
doesn't matter. You've got Laura.

42:28.510 --> 42:30.501
Now give me the letter and move out.

42:30.579 --> 42:33.639
But they'll kill him! It's all
right, Laura. You just stay here.

42:33.715 --> 42:37.151
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try and talk Tobin out.

42:37.219 --> 42:39.949
If you interfere, I'll kill you.

43:13.788 --> 43:15.722
Tobin!

43:32.607 --> 43:35.440
All right, Tobin,
throw the rifle down.

44:02.971 --> 44:06.702
Eric, don't run.!
I don't want to have to shoot.

45:06.968 --> 45:08.731
- Eric!
- Laura!

45:23.585 --> 45:28.852
You had to finish what you
started in Rabal, didn't you?

45:28.923 --> 45:31.391
Eric's letter was the truth.

45:31.459 --> 45:34.394
You got 'em killed.
You blew their cover.

45:34.462 --> 45:39.024
Magnum, you don't understand.

45:39.100 --> 45:42.558
Someone on that team in Rabal
was a double agent,

45:42.637 --> 45:45.265
but I didn't know who.

45:45.340 --> 45:48.707
It could've been Tobin or Dietrich...

45:48.777 --> 45:51.940
or Marks or Deploma.

45:52.013 --> 45:53.947
I couldn't find out who.

45:54.015 --> 45:56.506
So you blew the cover on all four of 'em.

45:56.584 --> 45:59.917
I had no choice. No choice?

45:59.988 --> 46:02.513
You killed three innocent men.
Three white hats.

46:02.590 --> 46:05.525
Three on our side who risked
their lives for their country,

46:05.593 --> 46:07.925
and their country blew 'em away.

46:07.996 --> 46:09.930
No choice.

46:11.966 --> 46:16.027
Where's the letter?
I'll give you anything.

46:16.104 --> 46:20.131
I mailed it. You mailed it?

46:20.208 --> 46:23.006
You're damn right I did,
to the Washington Post.

46:23.078 --> 46:26.275
It's over, Newton.

46:28.783 --> 46:31.013
It's over.

46:46.701 --> 46:49.499
It's what I saw. What you saw?

46:49.571 --> 46:51.869
In my head. It's what I've been
seeing all these months!

46:51.940 --> 46:56.639
Thomas, I could've stopped it!
No, you couldn't. It's all right.

46:56.711 --> 46:58.338
But he could.

47:19.134 --> 47:22.069
God, it runs great, T.C.
just great.

47:22.137 --> 47:24.071
Why didn't you tune it like this
in the first place?

47:24.139 --> 47:27.506
Well, because this time,
I had a little bit of motivation.

47:55.637 --> 47:58.663
Hey, Higgins, this is great!

47:58.740 --> 48:02.232
Listen!

48:02.310 --> 48:04.904
You ever heard anything
more beautiful in your life?

48:11.553 --> 48:13.487
It sounds adequate.

48:13.555 --> 48:16.820
Adequate? Man, I just added
20 years to the life of this car.

48:16.891 --> 48:21.487
- You did the tune-up?
- Yep.

48:22.530 --> 48:24.998
Are you an authorized
Ferrari mechanic?

48:25.066 --> 48:28.092
A what?
Higgins, what are you trying to pull?

48:28.169 --> 48:33.163
Nothing. Only if this car is so much as
touched by an unauthorized mechanic,

48:33.241 --> 48:35.175
the warranty is voided.

48:36.911 --> 48:39.880
You know what happens
when you void a warranty, Magnum?

48:42.016 --> 48:43.950
Kind of.

48:44.018 --> 48:47.954
You're responsible for all repairs
and maintenance from there on out.

48:48.022 --> 48:51.788
Yeah, but what if T.C.
is an authorized mechanic?

48:51.860 --> 48:53.725
Impossible.

48:53.795 --> 48:56.355
T.C., show him your papers.

48:58.299 --> 49:01.564
You mean you're not
an authorized mechanic?

49:01.636 --> 49:03.570
Then give me that!

49:03.638 --> 49:06.505
Well, give me that!
Give me that.
