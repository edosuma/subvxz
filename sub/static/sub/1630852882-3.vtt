WEBVTT

00:36.454 --> 00:39.832
One less angel in heaven, baby!

01:33.302 --> 01:35.137
The guy at table six
took his dick out again.

01:35.221 --> 01:39.475
Table six
took his dick out!

01:41.060 --> 01:43.437
- Motherfucker!
- Trixie's down!

01:43.521 --> 01:45.105
Trixie, you okay?
Hey, Jerry!

01:49.610 --> 01:52.404
That was the sweet,
saintly Philomena.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.114
Heavenly, wouldn't you say?

01:54.198 --> 01:55.825
Motherfuck,
my fucking head!

01:55.825 --> 01:58.494
And that was Philomena's foulmouthed friend,

01:58.494 --> 02:00.454
- Philadelphia.
- Take it off!

02:00.538 --> 02:02.414
Sweet thought,
but I think I'll keep it on.

02:02.498 --> 02:04.625
- Take it off!
- Take it off!

02:04.625 --> 02:06.752
- Take it off!
- We're not kidding!

02:06.836 --> 02:09.129
Guys, hear me.
By the time I finish

02:09.213 --> 02:11.090
unzipping,
unfastening and unhooking

02:11.090 --> 02:13.133
the medieval contraption
of rayon and rubber

02:13.217 --> 02:15.511
that is my girdle, you'll all be
back in bed with your wives

02:15.511 --> 02:17.972
telling them
how much you hated working late.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.640
-
- Well, you didn't say

02:19.640 --> 02:22.393
you were gonna throw an oily,
crumpled dollar bill at me.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.895
Now it's coming off.

02:24.979 --> 02:27.189
- Maisel!
- Oops, no time.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.149
Uh, but hold on to your <i>Great Gatsbys,</i> guys,

02:29.233 --> 02:32.903
'cause here comes our salute
to the Roaring '20s.

02:40.369 --> 02:45.207
But first,
Sapphira, Lonely Harem Girl.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.959
- What the hell?
- I didn't know.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.460
No one knows shit around here.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.087
Three, four.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.807
Boise, what happened
to the Roaring '20s?

03:01.891 --> 03:03.726
Trixie got beaned by the wire.

03:03.726 --> 03:06.312
- I saw. I heard.
- So we went with Harem Girl.

03:06.312 --> 03:08.314
- Without telling me.
- You were onstage.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.399
Getting the crowd excited
for a sexy flapper.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.318
- We confused them.
- Look, as long as some girl's

03:12.318 --> 03:14.445
out there shaking her <i>chichis,</i>
those guys don't care

03:14.445 --> 03:16.155
- how the fuck they're dressed.
- I disagree.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.656
With Sapphira the Harem Girl,
they're anticipating

03:17.740 --> 03:19.283
sultry, mysterious <i>chichis,</i>

03:19.283 --> 03:21.327
not the bippity-boppity <i>chichis</i>
of the Roaring '20s girl.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.536
Look, no one's confused

03:22.620 --> 03:23.913
'cause no one's
hardly listening to you.

03:23.913 --> 03:26.165
- I take offense at that.
- You all do.

03:26.165 --> 03:27.583
Can do better than this, Boise.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.960
Talk to Clifford.
He signs the checks.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.463
Ooh! <i>- Excusez-moi.</i>

03:32.463 --> 03:35.799
Hey, everyone.
Uh, Boise's not so great

03:35.883 --> 03:38.177
at formal introductions,
so I wanted to introduce myself.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.387
Hi. I'm Midge.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.473
Mrs. Maisel. I'm the new MC

03:42.473 --> 03:44.099
here at the Wolf,

03:44.183 --> 03:47.519
so any of you want to add a dash
of humor to your routines,

03:47.603 --> 03:49.563
consider me
your comedy consultant.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.482
Okay, well...

03:51.482 --> 03:53.567
As you were.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.905
Ooh! Sorry.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.033
Come on, six. Come on, six.

04:01.033 --> 04:04.036
Oh! The hard way!

04:04.036 --> 04:06.288
- Let's go again. Come on.
- Raking it in.

04:06.372 --> 04:07.581
- Yes.
- Damn.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.668
- Cup of coffee for you.
- On a hot one tonight!

04:10.668 --> 04:12.544
- I know you like one right around now.
- Oh.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.546
Come on,
dice! Dice...

04:14.630 --> 04:16.298
Smells fresh.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.258
- Crap!
- It's supposed to.

04:18.342 --> 04:21.804
So, I would love to suggest
some small improvements

04:21.804 --> 04:23.806
that I think would make the club
all that it can be.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.265
Yeah, uh...

04:25.349 --> 04:27.101
A better system for announcing
the acts would be great.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.686
Plus, there are
a lot of avoidable injuries.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.229
Maybe we should have
a safety meeting.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.438
- Uh...
- In the Catskills,

04:31.522 --> 04:33.023
I was frequently voted
safety monitor

04:33.107 --> 04:35.526
for various activities:
water sports, backpacking.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.986
We were hiking once,
and the rabbi

04:36.986 --> 04:38.529
thought for sure
he got bit by a snake.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.031
I sucked on that man
till he almost passed out.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.741
On his ankle, that is.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.702
Turned out to just be
a couple of mosquito bites,

04:44.702 --> 04:46.578
but people sure got a laugh
out of it.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.414
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, have a...

04:48.414 --> 04:50.833
have a... think on that.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.419
And...

04:56.046 --> 04:57.506
That's a safety risk, too.

05:04.555 --> 05:05.889
Fucking angel.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.474
Let me bum one.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.767
Did you hear
what happened out there?

05:08.851 --> 05:10.519
Flapper got her head smashed in.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.271
Heard the cursing.
Sounded kind of funny.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.023
Wasn't funny. It's sloppy.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.858
This place
has a lot of work to do.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.568
It's a strip club.
As long as a girl's up there

05:17.568 --> 05:19.111
shaking her <i>chichis,</i>
none of it matters.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.404
Maisel!

05:20.404 --> 05:22.448
Sapphira's wrapping up.

05:22.448 --> 05:24.491
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.618
- Who's next?
- Annie Oakley.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.038
- Thank you.
- Or Brenda the Bird Girl.

05:52.728 --> 05:56.106
- Take it off!
- Hey, there. You miss me?

06:00.444 --> 06:04.073
<i>Come along with me ♪</i>

06:04.073 --> 06:08.285
<i>♪ To my little corner
of the world</i> ♪

06:09.286 --> 06:12.247
<i>And dream a little dream ♪</i>♪

06:14.875 --> 06:17.336
Chester, you left
the fucking door open again.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.421
How many times do I got to...

06:22.049 --> 06:23.842
Is this something icky?

06:23.926 --> 06:25.928
- You must be Susie.
- Yeah.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.097
I'm Nancy. Jackie's sister.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.681
- Oh. Well, he's...
- Dead.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.642
He's dead.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.310
I'm sorry, what?

06:33.310 --> 06:35.562
A stroke
sometime this afternoon.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.607
A stroke?

06:38.607 --> 06:41.485
I was actually
at his bedside before he passed.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.487
He was still talking.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.280
Yeah, he likes to talk.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.491
His final words
were actually for you.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.951
For me?

06:48.951 --> 06:51.537
I wrote them down
so I wouldn't forget.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.247
"Susie,

06:53.247 --> 06:56.041
the guys are coming
to sand the floor at noon.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.668
Be there to let them in.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.546
They're flaky,
so fuck knows if they'll show.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.589
Remember, Monday's a holiday,

07:02.673 --> 07:04.967
so don't put the garbage out
Sunday night.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.427
We already got one ticket
from the city.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.847
If you're going to make
spaghetti sauce,

07:09.847 --> 07:12.933
push the curtains back,
because you splash a lot,

07:12.933 --> 07:14.768
and you can't get sauce

07:14.852 --> 07:18.230
<i>out of that fabric.
It's just too delicate."</i>

07:19.231 --> 07:20.607
Plastic.

07:20.691 --> 07:23.110
<i>The modern miracle.</i>

07:23.110 --> 07:25.654
And, ladies, these are some
of the finest plastic products

07:25.654 --> 07:27.698
- on the household market.
- They sure are.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.782
There's so much to choose from.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.075
There's
so many convenient sizes,

07:30.159 --> 07:31.243
so many vivid colors.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.453
And you are going
to want it all.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.706
This is the Wonderlier.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.541
That's such a cute name.
I love that name.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.626
And for sizable suppers,

07:39.710 --> 07:42.004
the large Wonderlier.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.755
Well, I have to have
two of everything now.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.175
It's just so good! Sign me up.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.385
Uh, pass the Wonderliers around,

07:48.385 --> 07:50.262
ladies,
and I will be right back.

07:50.262 --> 07:53.056
Oh, ladies, do I have a story for you.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.933
- I know a girl...
- You'd have less need for Tupperware

07:55.017 --> 07:56.268
if you weren't just cooking
for one.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.769
- Can we set up a lunch?
- Uh, Mama,

07:57.853 --> 07:59.771
Jean here is missing out
on the demonstration.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.274
Why don't you get back
to the group, Jean.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.776
Miriam,
I'm trying to make a sale here.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.653
And so am I. Beat it.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.238
She's making dinner,

08:08.322 --> 08:10.657
and in comes a burglar
with a gun.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.159
She screams, he shoots,

08:12.159 --> 08:14.411
and the Tupperware she
was holding stops the bullet.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.205
I mean, they don't even mention that

08:16.205 --> 08:18.415
- in the literature.
- Imogene.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.084
Dial it down, woman.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.920
Midge, do you want to make
some sales or not?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.338
- Yes.
- Showing them how to burp

08:24.338 --> 08:26.048
a two-quart
is not going to move product,

08:26.048 --> 08:27.925
and you are here
to move product.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.010
Now sell.

08:31.053 --> 08:33.180
Ladies, I think it's time
to get those order forms out.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.390
And when that is done,
I will announce the winner

08:35.474 --> 08:37.643
of the silliest Tupperware hat.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.104
Oh, my God.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.940
What? Are you okay?

08:42.940 --> 08:44.483
Uh...

08:44.483 --> 08:47.110
Everyone, uh, please excuse me.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.196
- Imogene?
- I got it.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.783
Let's drop the bullshit, ladies,

08:52.783 --> 08:54.785
and make some deals.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.581
You need to eat.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.166
- Mm-hmm.
- This hot plate is no good.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.918
I don't think
all this is gonna fit.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.003
- How's that sandwich?
- Great.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.672
Hot here, cold here.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.799
Okay,
we're officially out of room.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.634
What? No.
The pudding has to go in there.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.344
- Don't think so.
- Oh, strudel.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.929
Okay, we can freeze the chicken.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.764
- Where's the freezer?
- Up there.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.849
What is this place, the gulag?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.851
Oh, I made Zelda mad.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.979
- I didn't know you could make Zelda mad.
- Trade you.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.856
All the lady magazines say
you should defrost once a month.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.484
- This is crazy.
- Mmm, good coffee.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.904
- Oh, you've got ants.
- You should've called me.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.531
I called you.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.658
I mean the minute you found out.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.159
I don't want you sitting
in a dark apartment,

09:36.243 --> 09:38.870
drinking for hours by yourself
at a time like this.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.163
- I'm here.
- Now you're mad

09:40.247 --> 09:42.833
- just like Zelda.
- I'm not mad.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.169
Jackie's dead.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.838
I know, honey.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.925
Really?

09:52.009 --> 09:54.303
He was here all alone, then bam.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.180
Old Gianni upstairs
said he heard a thud.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.516
Called the cops.
They load him in the car,

09:59.516 --> 10:02.227
and they took him to Bellevue,
and by 9:00, that was it.

10:02.311 --> 10:05.272
- He's gone.
- Well, he wasn't sick.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.941
He didn't suffer.
We should be grateful for that.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.651
It was the chili dogs.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.029
I warned him
about those chili dogs.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.740
Fucking guy
subsisted on chili dogs.

10:14.740 --> 10:18.160
- The ice wins. We have to eat it all now.
- When's the service?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.661
- Don't know.
- Well, how can I get ahold

10:19.745 --> 10:21.204
- of his sister?
- Don't know.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.914
- Did she leave a card?
- No.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.583
Maybe she wrote something down?

10:24.583 --> 10:25.917
You have one fork?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.336
She didn't write anything down.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.379
I don't know
where the funeral is.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.757
I don't know where the sister is
or who the sister is.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.092
I just know that last night,
when I wasn't here,

10:34.176 --> 10:35.385
the biggest pain in my ass ever

10:35.469 --> 10:37.971
dropped the fuck dead
in my apartment!

10:40.599 --> 10:42.517
Forks.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.774
I'm sorry.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.817
I'm sorry, too.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.611
I don't want to stay
in this apartment.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.237
Somebody died here. It's creepy.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.239
Mm,
it's not the first time.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.991
Huh?

10:58.075 --> 10:59.785
There's been a lot of deaths
in this room.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.119
What?

11:01.203 --> 11:02.704
I researched
the apartment's history

11:02.788 --> 11:05.665
- at the municipal archives before I moved in.
- Why?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.084
Because that's
the first thing you do

11:07.084 --> 11:08.710
before you move
into an apartment.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.670
- No, it's not.
- There was a decapitation.

11:10.754 --> 11:14.341
A woman was eaten alive
by maggots.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.760
Identical twins
were disemboweled to music.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.763
A pipe exploded,
drowning an entire family.

11:19.763 --> 11:20.889
Then there's the crib deaths.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.392
Chester. Just eat your eggs.

11:23.392 --> 11:24.851
Hey.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.645
Four choking deaths
right in this corner.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.398
Maybe don't rush me.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.070
I hope it's enough.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.363
Mr. Moishe likes squash.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.365
Ah, I didn't make enough squash.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.534
I will skip the squash
so there's squash for Moishe.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.285
It's so nice
that we're all together again.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.705
Oh, Zelda, no.
You've been crying for two days.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.708
So, I figured
only Moishe-y knew him.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.586
You must've encountered
him at some point, Moishe.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.296
We know his family
from the Catskills.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.631
I know
the parents a little.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.383
And the grandfather.
Saw him in the shower once

11:56.383 --> 11:58.885
after racquetball. Wrinkliest
nutsack I've ever seen.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.512
And he's seen some beauts.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.764
- Oh, dear.
- We're talking about the bar mitzvah boy?

12:02.848 --> 12:05.559
- Akiva?
- Mm-hmm. Moishe was asked to do an aliyah at his service,

12:05.559 --> 12:07.436
- and he swears he's never met him.
- And it's a short list

12:07.436 --> 12:09.688
of people you pick to do
an aliyah at your bar mitzvah.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.731
You'd think you'd pick someone
that knows who the fuck you are.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.317
Well, it's nice
just to be wanted by someone.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.819
Anyone.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.488
Our house is so empty now.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.657
Abe and I will visit soon,
Shirley. I promise.

12:20.657 --> 12:21.658
Tuesday?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.034
I don't know about Tuesday.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.619
Wednesday? I'll make my cabbage.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.455
It'll be soon. You have my word.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.124
Your word is fairly meaningless,
Rose. You know it, I know it.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.168
- So let's set a date.
- Hello!

12:31.168 --> 12:33.170
- The youth have returned.
- Ethan!

12:33.170 --> 12:34.838
Come here. Grandpa's
got to pick your brain.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.757
- Saw Abe coming up behind me.
- His hours are

12:37.841 --> 12:40.385
- so unpredictable these days.
- Wow, look at this place.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.179
It's all back together.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.306
This is new.
The old one was chipped.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.640
I remember
when Ethan chipped it.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.476
Akiva Bergman.
It doesn't ring a bell,

12:47.476 --> 12:48.977
- huh?
- No.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.353
- Don't rush. Think, think.
- I've got

12:50.437 --> 12:52.272
dinner for you and Esther
in the kitchen, Ethan.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.149
- Say good night.
- Good night.

12:54.149 --> 12:56.401
- Good night.
- Maybe you bought the kid

12:56.485 --> 12:58.737
an ice cream once, huh?
You know, and it was so special.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.238
It really meant something.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.865
I don't go around
the Catskills buying ice cream

13:01.865 --> 13:03.533
for little boys I don't know.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.118
There's plenty of those guys
crawling around up there,

13:05.202 --> 13:06.661
- you know what I'm saying?
- No.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.246
- What are you saying?
- You remember Daniel Sandberg?

13:08.330 --> 13:09.873
With the Coke-bottle glasses?

13:09.873 --> 13:11.791
I do.
He'd drive up with his mother.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.335
Called him Danny Deep-Pockets.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.046
Went around asking boys to dig
in his pants for candy corn.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.297
I knew nothing about this.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.132
Then there was Tom
from Buffalo

13:19.216 --> 13:22.260
- with the girly bangs.
- They called him Tommy Touch-Butt.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.307
Uh, Moishe, Shirley,
you remember Susie?

13:27.307 --> 13:30.602
- From Yom Kippur?
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:30.602 --> 13:31.645
What's going on?

13:31.645 --> 13:33.188
- A guy died.
- Oh, my God.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.148
- Who? Your husband?
- Uh, her roommate.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.858
Jackie from the Gaslight.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.444
Shit. I knew him. What happened?

13:39.528 --> 13:40.862
I just told you.
He fucking died.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.239
Right. Sorry.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.949
So did a lot of people in my apartment.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.367
Chester's got a list.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.576
Cheeky Chester?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.036
Abe. Just in time to eat.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.288
Did you not see me behind you?

13:50.372 --> 13:51.998
- Yeah, but...
- Let's eat, everyone.
- Yeah.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.084
- Before it gets cold.
- Oh, yeah.
- I had to stand there

13:54.084 --> 13:57.170
and watch the elevator
take you up to the ninth floor,

13:57.254 --> 13:58.505
stop, come back down.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.882
Then I had to get on,
take it back up.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.842
That's 27 floors.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.303
You'll survive, Papa.
It's family style, everyone.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.972
Forget your manners and dive in.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.932
Well, good thing I made it,

14:08.932 --> 14:11.476
because I have a fun piece
of news for everyone.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.771
I've been... I've...

14:14.771 --> 14:17.148
I've been assigned...

14:17.232 --> 14:19.568
- Why is Zelda crying?
- I didn't make enough squash,

14:19.568 --> 14:21.486
- and I'm just so happy.
- We're good

14:21.570 --> 14:23.572
from here, Zelda.
Why don't you take a break.

14:23.572 --> 14:27.200
So, the <i>Village Voice</i>
has assigned me,

14:27.284 --> 14:28.827
its chief theater critic,

14:28.827 --> 14:31.162
to review a new Broadway musical

14:31.246 --> 14:33.623
by our own Buzz Goldberg.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.000
- My God.
- Buzz has a show?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.585
- Like, a real show?
- Yeah.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.420
That musical he's been
workshopping at Steiner

14:38.420 --> 14:39.921
for, what, eight years now?

14:40.005 --> 14:43.258
It's a real success story.
Did very well in New Haven.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.011
Has a lot of good buzz, pardon the pun.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.388
- Ha! Good one.
- And there's an opening night ticket

14:48.388 --> 14:49.639
for each and every one of you.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.474
- Opening night.
- Fun.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.767
Abe, what a score.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.394
I already don't have
anything to wear.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.230
I'm so proud of Buzz.
He never gave up on the show.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.190
- We must have seen it at the resort about 20 times.
- Mm.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.318
And that song. You can't
get it out of your head.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.902
You were in a version
of Buzz's show one year,

15:02.986 --> 15:04.696
weren't you, Miriam?
Up at Steiner?

15:04.696 --> 15:07.741
I played Clare Landsburg
in the summer of 1953.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.075
And he dropped you, right?

15:09.159 --> 15:11.953
No. I wasn't dropped.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.455
I did the show for a while,

15:13.455 --> 15:15.290
and it went very well,
and then I made way

15:15.290 --> 15:17.584
for another lucky young lady
to play the role.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.753
I thought he dropped you
because you can't sing or act.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.338
Or dance.
That's how I remember it.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.964
You couldn't sing
or act or dance.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.633
Please, people.
She's no Judy Garland,

15:24.633 --> 15:26.176
but she gave it her best shot.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.011
Right. No, I'm not Judy Garland,

15:28.011 --> 15:30.472
but who is?
Besides Judy Garland.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.848
And you froze that one time.
Remember?

15:31.848 --> 15:34.309
You came out on stage.
You couldn't remember your line.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.977
One time, Shirley.
I froze one time.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.146
I'd seen the show so much
that I knew the line.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.106
Everybody did. The whole room
was yelling out the line.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.275
I wasn't fired
from the show. Okay?

15:42.359 --> 15:45.111
Is this all the squash?

15:45.195 --> 15:46.821
Oh, and, Joel,

15:46.905 --> 15:48.907
regardless
of the elevator incident,

15:48.907 --> 15:51.242
I'm not leaving you out. There's
a ticket for you, as well.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.912
Two, actually,
if you'd like to bring a friend.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.330
Yeah, Joel. Bring a friend.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.541
Archie or may... be
someone else.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.127
There is no one else.
One ticket will suffice, Abe.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.712
You know, Joel,
I still consider you

16:02.796 --> 16:05.048
a family member,
and it seems a shame

16:05.048 --> 16:07.425
- that you're alone.
- There was a perfectly good girl

16:07.509 --> 16:09.678
I set him up with last week.
Lena Brofmann.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.262
It was a boy, by the way.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.430
Wow. You work quick.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.973
Excuse me, Ma,
for not wanting to go out

16:14.057 --> 16:15.183
with a pregnant divorced woman.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.519
She's not divorced.
Her husband died.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.062
- Everyone dies.
- Can we change

16:19.062 --> 16:21.106
- the subject?
- Shirley, I'm disappointed.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.482
You have
a matchmaking professional

16:22.482 --> 16:24.484
in the family,
after all. Use me.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.529
- My God, you're right.
- It says call for an appointment,

16:27.529 --> 16:30.115
but there's no appointment
necessary for you.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.700
No, please don't give her
your card, Rose.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.244
It doesn't matter. I know
her name. I know her number.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.037
Rose, change your name.
Change your number.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.872
What's Joel's type?

16:37.956 --> 16:39.958
- I know Miriam was his type, but what else?
- Moishe,

16:39.958 --> 16:42.043
- if you're going to do an aliyah, do it right.
- He likes an athletic girl.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.505
You're gonna correct the next one?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.840
- Oh, how sweet.
- Little Molly?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.883
How about 63 years
as a devout Jew?

16:48.967 --> 16:50.301
- Stickball player.
- Stickball?

16:50.385 --> 16:51.720
Oh, I'm gonna write that down.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.471
An athletic,
stickball-playing type?

16:53.555 --> 16:55.348
Anything I can do
to make you stop?

16:56.808 --> 17:00.311
Rose?
Is my bathrobe in the bathroom?

17:02.397 --> 17:04.190
Rose?

17:04.274 --> 17:05.650
Rose!

17:05.734 --> 17:07.026
What, Abe?

17:07.110 --> 17:09.195
I thought you were looking
for my bathrobe.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.905
No, Abe,
I'm getting ready for bed.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.574
Are you
seeing this?

17:12.574 --> 17:14.117
<i>- I'm, uh, picking up...</i>
- Rose.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.286
No,
your bathrobe is not in here.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.538
- Well, then, where is it?
- It's where you left it last.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.542
You look terrible,
by the way.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.085
<i>-
- Thank you, Groucho.</i>

17:24.169 --> 17:26.254
I'm not laughing.
This-this isn't a bit.

17:26.254 --> 17:28.339
<i>This is more
like a national emergency.</i>

17:30.133 --> 17:31.885
<i>Well, you look fantastic.</i>

17:31.885 --> 17:33.845
<i>Trim and rested.
What's your secret?</i>

17:33.845 --> 17:35.930
<i>I'm 28.</i>

17:36.014 --> 17:37.724
Here. <i>- No, seriously,</i>

17:37.724 --> 17:39.684
<i>you look the same as you did
in the pictures I grew up on</i>

17:39.768 --> 17:41.436
<i>a long time ago.
How do you do it?</i>

17:41.436 --> 17:43.062
<i>Spending my golden years
with the wife.</i>

17:43.146 --> 17:44.481
<i>How long you two been married?</i>

17:44.481 --> 17:46.775
<i>Oh, I wasn't talking
about my wife.</i>

17:46.775 --> 17:48.568
<i>-
- Both of Groucho's parents are dead.</i>

17:48.568 --> 17:50.528
Maybe you should get some sleep.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.781
- Can't sleep.
- You want a little something?

17:52.781 --> 17:54.824
- My mother has some pills.
- Oh, I know.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.409
I've been
through your mom's pills.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.827
She's got a lot of them.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.829
She has three different places
she hides them,

17:59.913 --> 18:01.956
in case you're wondering
why that woman has a sewing kit.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.503
Found Jackie's sister,
by the way.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.922
She asked me
if I would speak at the service.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.965
What did you say?

18:11.049 --> 18:14.177
I was trapped, so I said yes.
What am I gonna say, no?

18:14.177 --> 18:16.221
You sure you're up for that?

18:16.221 --> 18:18.306
Try not to fuck it up too badly.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.183
Who got you hooked
on cigars, Groucho?

18:20.183 --> 18:21.601
Well, who else? Chico.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.895
<i>- Chico smokes cigars?</i>
- Get some sleep.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.730
Leave your beer. <i>- There's not a lot Chico doesn't do except read.</i>

18:25.814 --> 18:27.816
He's a pretty big
gambler, your brother.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.192
If you enjoy understatements.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.860
Any idea
how much he's lost?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.362
Chico always says
if you add up all the money

18:32.362 --> 18:34.948
<i>Harpo has,
that's how much I've lost.</i>

18:37.826 --> 18:41.037
Eat fast, Ethan. We've got
a big, fun day planned.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.956
- Okay.
- Does this necklace work?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.416
- If you have to ask...
- Changing the necklace.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.126
Mama, can I borrow
your banana pin?

18:47.210 --> 18:48.586
It's in my jewelry box.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.797
But if you're gonna do bananas
on your dress,

18:50.797 --> 18:53.842
change your cherry earrings.
Too much fruit seems lazy.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.510
Good morning, Susie.

18:55.510 --> 18:58.346
Ethan Ramone Maisel,
move your tuchus.

18:58.346 --> 19:01.182
- I mean it. We cannot be late.
- That's right, Ethan.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.102
You can't be late for the doctor.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.022
Oh. Mama, we don't tell him
he's going to the doctor.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.275
We tell him he's going
on a fun subway adventure.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.901
Well, the cat's
out of the bag now.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.194
- I hate the doctor!
- Come on, Esther.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.029
Let's go talk your brother
off that ledge.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.531
- Morning, Susie.
- The doctor's the worst!

19:16.531 --> 19:18.283
I got a blintz.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.993
You're going to make your sister...

19:19.993 --> 19:22.871
- Leave me alone!
- Stop running around. No running.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.914
No running.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.500
I don't want
to go to the doctor!

19:27.584 --> 19:30.920
Okay, look, I need one of you
to stay with her.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.756
- What?
- There's no way I can take her to the pediatrician's

19:33.840 --> 19:35.550
with all her talk about people dropping dead.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.719
Well, I certainly can't take her
to the <i>Village Voice.</i>

19:37.719 --> 19:40.388
I'm still new there.
I might get a nickname today.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.766
- No.
- Fine.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.727
We'll do rock paper scissors.
Ready?

19:45.727 --> 19:47.645
One, two, three.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.981
- Maisel residence.
- Who won?

19:49.981 --> 19:52.692
One moment, please.
It's for you, Miss Susie.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.694
...behavior
of the United States...

19:54.694 --> 19:57.322
I hate the doctor!

19:57.322 --> 19:58.907
Hello?

19:58.907 --> 20:01.659
Hey, Susie, it's J.J.
You hear about Jackie?

20:01.743 --> 20:02.952
Yeah, I fucking heard
about Jackie.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.287
I was living with him, moron.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.122
<i>Well, he left some boxes here.</i>

20:06.122 --> 20:07.749
Boxes of what?

20:07.749 --> 20:10.084
I don't know. Stuff? Junk?
I don't know.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.669
What do you want me to do?

20:11.753 --> 20:13.129
<i>I don't know. You want me
to dump 'em? I don't care.</i>

20:13.129 --> 20:15.590
Don't dump 'em.
I'll come by sometime this week.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.342
Okay, but they're
taking up space.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.593
Yeah, so are you. <i>- Hey, you looking</i>

20:18.593 --> 20:20.303
<i>for a new roommate?</i>

20:20.303 --> 20:22.305
I'm gonna watch TV.

20:22.305 --> 20:23.973
Guys,
it's rock paper scissors.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.183
Each thing beats something else.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.559
It's a kid's game
for God's sake.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.019
But what if I chose heat?

20:28.019 --> 20:30.104
- Heat would melt the scissors.
- And burn the paper.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.065
So heat would beat
everything but rock.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.816
Heat is not an option.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.235
Water would rust the scissors
and ruin the paper.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.654
Are the scissors brass or steel?

20:37.654 --> 20:40.156
How about we just
flip a coin, hmm?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.953
And your hobbies are knitting,
needlepoint, and weaving?

20:44.953 --> 20:46.913
I own my own loom.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.916
All right. Well, we'll put
that into column two.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.919
Remember, we discussed this?
The after-marriage revelations?

20:52.919 --> 20:55.171
Mm-mm.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.924
I promise you, Amelia, we will
find you the perfect mate.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.342
You think so?

20:59.342 --> 21:00.718
I do.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.096
I really do.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.223
Because every time I meet a man,
I never know what to say.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.350
It doesn't matter what you say.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.851
The man's not listening
to you anyhow.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.229
- Rose!
- Yes, Susie?

21:11.229 --> 21:13.564
- My page is full.
- Well, then turn it over.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.025
- Both sides.
- What about the other pages?

21:16.109 --> 21:18.945
- All full.
- Then we will get you more paper.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.530
All right, Amelia.
Tell your mother

21:20.530 --> 21:22.949
the meeting went well, and
the address to send the check

21:22.949 --> 21:24.742
- is on the back of the card.
- Okay.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.078
Thank you.

21:27.078 --> 21:29.205
I'm very excited.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.335
Good? Was it good?

21:34.419 --> 21:37.213
Very good.
I need to use the restroom.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.715
Susie? Tinkle time.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.925
- I already went.
- Rose?

21:41.009 --> 21:42.677
You'll have to delay
your break for a bit.

21:42.677 --> 21:45.013
- You have a walk-in.
- Another one?

21:45.013 --> 21:46.431
Another two!

21:46.431 --> 21:48.933
Word of your prowess is
spreading like melancholia.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.144
My goodness,
it's all happening so fast.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.520
It's thrilling.
You already have

21:52.520 --> 21:54.439
three confirmed kills
this month.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.274
Three matches,
three engagements.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.609
So much goddamn happiness.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.486
Contain yourself.
We're in a tea room.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.196
People are steeping.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.573
- Rose!
- What?

22:03.573 --> 22:06.325
I'm bored. I'm hungry.
I want to leave.

22:06.409 --> 22:07.577
I'm working, Susie.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.995
We will leave when I'm done.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.913
Ugh! Hate this!

22:10.997 --> 22:12.665
Get her some more paper,
will you?

22:12.749 --> 22:15.543
Of course. Question:
why is she here?

22:15.543 --> 22:16.919
A gentleman passed away
in her apartment.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.129
And she can't go back.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.381
Oh. Is he blocking
the door, or...?

22:20.465 --> 22:22.508
I don't know. Go get
the next person signed in?

22:22.592 --> 22:24.052
Yes. Of course.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.428
Mirabelle,
you're up next.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.764
She's getting your paper.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.932
You're a matchmaker, huh?

22:30.016 --> 22:32.143
- That's right.
- You really think there's someone out there

22:32.143 --> 22:33.895
for that gorgon that just left?

22:33.895 --> 22:36.355
- Yes.
- She's got a hunchback.

22:36.439 --> 22:39.275
- I can fix that.
- Really? You gonna blind the guy?

22:39.275 --> 22:41.778
Susie! This is a business.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.613
Now you are my daughter's
manager and a plumber

22:43.613 --> 22:45.490
before that, so you should
understand business.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.700
I will send the gorgon
to my hairstylist,

22:47.784 --> 22:49.327
and she will fix her hair.

22:49.327 --> 22:50.828
And I will teach her
about foundation

22:50.912 --> 22:52.580
and mascara and lipstick
and deodorant,

22:52.580 --> 22:54.707
and we will get her a girdle,
and she will sit up straight,

22:54.791 --> 22:56.793
and we'll destroy her loom,
and she will have a husband.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.921
Because there is someone
out there for everyone.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.714
What are you looking at me for?

23:01.798 --> 23:03.925
What's this?

23:03.925 --> 23:05.676
I ordered it for you.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.762
For me? The whole thing?

23:07.762 --> 23:10.098
- Yes.
- And it's just whipped cream?

23:10.098 --> 23:12.100
And a spoon.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.685
And I can just eat it? It
doesn't have to go on anything?

23:14.769 --> 23:16.479
That's right.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.189
Rose Weissman,
I would follow you into hell.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.942
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, hello.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.193
Yikes.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.694
- Susie!
- Sorry.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.822
You must be Mirabelle. I'm Rose.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.782
What a lovely dress.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.493
What can I do for you?

23:37.667 --> 23:39.544
Ma, there's sweat
running down your neck.

23:39.544 --> 23:41.129
- Let it go.
- It's opening night.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.839
Why would I not wear my best?

23:42.839 --> 23:44.590
It's 80 degrees out.
You're gonna melt.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.467
- Let it go.
- I want to be buried in this coat.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.302
- That may happen tonight.
- Let it go.

23:48.386 --> 23:49.804
There they are.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.029
Follow me, everybody.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.130
Mr. Weissman. Welcome.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.841
I'm Gerald, the house manager.
Your tickets, sir.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.676
Thank you. Do you like my cape?

24:28.676 --> 24:30.469
It's very natty.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.138
Ma'am, would you like
to check your...

24:32.138 --> 24:33.806
Let her wear it.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.809
Anything else you need,
let me know.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.896
Okay, looks like we have
five in the orchestra

24:39.896 --> 24:42.815
and two in the mezzanine.
Here you go.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.359
We're sitting together?

24:45.443 --> 24:46.652
- Away from you guys?
- Yep.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.529
- No, no.
- Oh, hey.

24:48.613 --> 24:49.822
- Is there...? No.
- No, no.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.657
- No, no.
- Can we...? I, I, I...

24:51.741 --> 24:53.409
- I would love to maybe switch?
- No.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.328
- Or maybe I can sit with Midge?
- I want to sit with Midge.

24:55.328 --> 24:58.206
Yes? Midge?
Yes? Yes? Midge? Yes?

24:58.206 --> 25:01.292
Well, the five are
fifth row center, so...

25:03.211 --> 25:05.171
That's our cue, everybody.
Let's go in.

26:04.105 --> 26:05.898
A drink for you, sir?

26:05.982 --> 26:08.067
Are my feet on the ground?

26:08.067 --> 26:11.320
Oh, I want to see it again
and again and again and again.

26:11.404 --> 26:14.156
And that song
with the full orchestra, yowza!

26:14.240 --> 26:16.325
Oh, there he is.
There's our Buzz.

26:16.409 --> 26:19.203
Ah, that is a very
big smile on that boy's face.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.663
Well, he's earned it.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.123
I remember
a couple of summers ago,

26:22.123 --> 26:23.833
it was the cutest thing.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.294
Buzz came up to me and said...
Kitty Carlisle Hart!

26:26.294 --> 26:28.296
- Who?
- What's that?
- It's Kitty Carlisle Hart!

26:28.296 --> 26:29.922
From <i>To Tell The Truth.</i>

26:30.006 --> 26:31.966
Oh, it's my favorite game show!

26:31.966 --> 26:33.301
Kitty! Kitty!

26:33.301 --> 26:34.927
Go get 'em, tiger!

26:35.011 --> 26:36.721
Wait! Wait, wait,
Kitty! Kitty!

26:36.721 --> 26:38.139
- Her?
- Kitty, wait, wait!

26:38.139 --> 26:39.765
- Her?
- Do you find her attractive?

26:39.849 --> 26:41.225
Rose, please don't feel
the need to...

26:41.309 --> 26:43.144
Oops. Never mind. Didn't see
the mole till she turned.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.354
Would you find her attractive
without the mole?

26:45.438 --> 26:47.648
I made two rounds of the place.
No sign of Susie.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.900
Good. Three songs in,
she pulled out a bag of Cheetos

26:49.984 --> 26:51.819
and told everyone who shushed
her they'll be dead someday.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.321
It's good she's gone.

26:53.321 --> 26:55.281
There they are.
The ones that got away.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.325
- Hi, Pauly.
- Hello, stranger.

26:57.325 --> 26:59.285
How are you, Pauly?

26:59.285 --> 27:01.704
Brokenhearted without you
at the resort this year.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.414
Maybe next year.

27:03.414 --> 27:04.832
How about our boy, huh?

27:04.832 --> 27:07.626
He had such big dreams,
but who knows from dreams.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.338
"A dreamer is one who can
only find his way by moonlight."

27:10.338 --> 27:12.590
- Oscar Wilde.
- And now look at me,

27:12.590 --> 27:15.009
a bigshot financial investor
in Buzz's dreams.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.969
Pauly, you macher!

27:17.053 --> 27:19.138
It's a small slice, but the
thing is, you hear that song,

27:19.138 --> 27:20.514
you take out your wallet.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.391
- Uh-huh.
- Miriam Maisel!

27:22.475 --> 27:25.186
- Look at you, all dolled up.
- Hello, Edie. Good to see you.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.980
I was just talking to someone.

27:28.064 --> 27:31.192
You were the star of this show
one year, weren't you?

27:31.192 --> 27:33.402
- Up at Steiner?
- Clare Landsburg,

27:33.486 --> 27:35.529
summer of '53, at your service.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.031
Then you got dumped, right?

27:37.031 --> 27:38.741
No, Edie.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.326
I wasn't dumped.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.370
Fired, whatever you want
to call it.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.789
It was just a fun vacation thing
I did one year.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.166
That's all.
I'm not an actress.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.877
Oh, you don't have to tell me.
I was there.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.879
It's really good
to see you, Edie.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.547
- Hello. Love that hat.
- Oh, hi!

27:53.631 --> 27:55.508
That Kitty Carlisle Hart,
she's like Houdini!

27:55.508 --> 27:57.551
I cornered her in a stall
in the bathroom.

27:57.635 --> 28:00.012
But when I kicked the door open,
she wasn't there.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.223
But I got her shoe.
Everyone look for a limper.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.933
Abe, he's free.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.810
Oh, let's grab him while we can.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.353
There he is.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.064
Buzz, dear,
we are so proud of you.

28:10.064 --> 28:13.442
Oh! I loved everything about it.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.569
Oh, but that one character, Iris.

28:15.653 --> 28:18.364
I mean, I hated her,
but I loved her, too.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.366
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Weissman.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.284
Uh, Abe, you didn't bring
your press hat.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.120
It clashed with my cape.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.330
Fun, right?

28:26.414 --> 28:28.165
It's amazing.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.584
I knew you
when you were a pisher.

28:30.668 --> 28:33.462
The kid who fell
into the lake on day one,

28:33.546 --> 28:35.256
holding a live mic.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.091
I like making a big entrance.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.552
Are you happy, Buzz? Be happy.

28:39.552 --> 28:43.097
I am.
It's the best night of my life.

28:43.097 --> 28:45.724
Hello, everyone.
Uh, can you hear me okay?

28:45.808 --> 28:47.893
- Yes!
- Yes? Very good.

28:47.977 --> 28:50.229
Thank you all
for coming tonight.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.148
For supporting our show.

28:52.148 --> 28:54.066
It means the world to us.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.068
But let me bring the true

28:56.152 --> 28:58.237
star of the night
up here to speak.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.823
The man who wrote the music,
the lyrics, the book--

29:00.823 --> 29:04.034
my friend, and yours,
Buzz Goldberg!

29:06.954 --> 29:09.123
Oh, thanks.
Uh, thanks, everyone.

29:09.123 --> 29:11.333
Ooh, it's a big night, um...

29:11.417 --> 29:13.586
I haven't breathed
since the curtain came up.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.546
Just breathe, Buzz, breathe.

29:15.546 --> 29:18.466
Um, thank you, Myron,

29:18.466 --> 29:20.718
for guiding the ship
and teaching me so much.

29:20.718 --> 29:24.638
And to our director,
Mr. George Abbott,

29:24.722 --> 29:27.016
I think you have a future
in this business, sir.

29:27.016 --> 29:30.019
And to my dramaturg

29:30.019 --> 29:32.605
and roommate, Kevin,
I owe you everything.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.607
Thank you, Kevin.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.817
And to the people
who inspired me so much,

29:36.901 --> 29:38.652
who inspired this show,

29:38.736 --> 29:41.655
my Steiner Resort family because

29:41.739 --> 29:44.950
you are just that-- family.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.410
Steiner!

29:46.494 --> 29:48.412
Steiner! Steiner!

29:48.496 --> 29:50.581
We're finer, finer!

29:50.581 --> 29:52.041
Finer!

29:52.041 --> 29:53.626
Steiner! Steiner...

29:53.626 --> 29:55.336
I need to go.
My deadline's tonight.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.171
Go, go. We'll see you at home.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.839
Finer! Finer! Finer!

29:58.923 --> 30:01.342
Steiner!

30:23.697 --> 30:25.699
Two guitars.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.661
Jackie would've hated that.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.622
Hey.

30:31.622 --> 30:34.542
- You going to the opera or something?
- Just get me Jackie's boxes.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.172
There's a couple others.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.258
This fell out of one of 'em.

30:49.306 --> 30:51.308
"Jacopo Dellapietra"?

30:51.392 --> 30:52.977
Jackie was in the Army?

30:52.977 --> 30:55.062
Don't know.

30:58.816 --> 31:00.734
A Bronze Star?

31:00.818 --> 31:02.820
Some kind of medal.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.826
Who's Darla?

31:18.252 --> 31:20.421
Abe Weissman, stop right there.

31:20.421 --> 31:22.506
Give me a 360.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.969
A cape is not an easy thing
to pull off, my friend.

31:26.969 --> 31:29.221
I make it look easy.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.390
- You ready to work?
- Oh, yes, I am.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.142
Sorry about the tight deadline.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.435
It's the way
it happens sometimes.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.228
Oh, I thrive on deadlines.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.771
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

31:37.855 --> 31:39.565
You bet.

31:40.858 --> 31:43.527
Got it!

31:47.531 --> 31:48.824
What is this?

31:48.824 --> 31:51.076
My review.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.911
<i>"They Came, They Danced</i>
opened last night

31:52.995 --> 31:54.747
at the Mark Hellinger Theatre.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.832
Your mother might like it."

31:58.500 --> 32:00.002
- I can't publish this.
- Why not?

32:00.002 --> 32:01.712
Well, for one, it's supposed
to be a thousand-word review

32:01.712 --> 32:03.088
and it's about a thousand
words short.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.090
I could add some adjectives.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.925
Abe, I need specifics.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.469
Specifics?

32:08.469 --> 32:10.262
If you think someone's mother
would like the show,

32:10.346 --> 32:12.181
then tell me
why you think someone's mother

32:12.181 --> 32:13.849
would like the show.
Do I really need

32:13.849 --> 32:15.684
- to tell you this?
- No, I know.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.853
But in this case,
I would really rather not...

32:17.853 --> 32:19.938
get into all that.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.232
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah.

32:22.316 --> 32:25.611
I just don't think specifics
are what people need.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.696
Or want.

32:27.780 --> 32:30.199
I don't know if you've ever done
any research on this,

32:30.199 --> 32:34.161
but I-I-I think
I'm right about this.

32:34.161 --> 32:36.038
Yeah.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.206
Abe...

32:37.206 --> 32:38.957
Okay, Gabe, here it is!

32:39.041 --> 32:41.460
The show was terrible, okay?
Terrible!

32:41.460 --> 32:43.629
I mean, a-a travesty.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.589
- Okay...
- They took a cute,

32:45.673 --> 32:48.092
charming musical,
conceived in the Catskills,

32:48.092 --> 32:50.594
cast with a fun group
of resort guests,

32:50.678 --> 32:52.262
all of whom were good,
except my daughter,

32:52.346 --> 32:54.765
and turned it into a bland,

32:54.765 --> 32:56.892
cynical, bloated

32:56.892 --> 33:00.354
three-hour piece
of contrived inanity!

33:00.354 --> 33:02.606
The costumes-- terrible.

33:02.690 --> 33:04.817
The sets-- terrible.

33:04.817 --> 33:07.861
The script-- terrible.
It's got one song.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.738
- One song?
- That they reprise

33:09.822 --> 33:12.116
five different times,
because they know

33:12.116 --> 33:14.076
they only have one good song.

33:14.076 --> 33:16.453
They're duping
the audience, Gabe!

33:16.537 --> 33:19.206
And that kills me.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.375
Great! Write that down.

33:24.878 --> 33:27.005
We've known this kid ten years.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.093
I watched him fall into a lake.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.886
I pulled him out.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.513
Maybe you shouldn't have.

33:35.472 --> 33:36.974
Dark thought, I know.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.851
Okay, Abe, how about this?
Skip the specifics.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.395
Use the show to get
to the big picture--

33:41.395 --> 33:42.938
your thoughts
on everything that's wrong

33:42.938 --> 33:44.481
in the theater today.

33:44.565 --> 33:46.650
Get angry. Be personal.

33:46.734 --> 33:48.485
That's why we hired you, Abe.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.362
For your voice.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.909
Don't let them get duped.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.014
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:17.014 --> 34:19.475
I just, you know, maybe I
should've worn something else.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.477
- Like what?
- I don't know.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.395
Like a dress.

34:23.479 --> 34:26.064
I don't... I can't...
I'm trying to picture...

34:26.148 --> 34:28.150
- Have you ever worn a dress?
- Of course I've worn a dress.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.068
- I was a baby once.
- Okay.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.862
- You know, helpless.
- Sorry.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.281
I was fucking adorable
in a dress.

34:37.326 --> 34:39.745
This way, I guess.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.670
- Did you get the time wrong?
- I did not get the time wrong.

34:48.754 --> 34:49.797
'Cause you have
a problem with time.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.799
I did not get the time wrong.

34:51.799 --> 34:53.383
Susie, thank you for coming.

34:53.467 --> 34:54.843
Oh, yeah, sure.
Uh, Nancy, this is...

34:54.927 --> 34:56.512
You must be Miriam.
The comedian?

34:56.512 --> 34:58.889
Yes. I'm so sorry about Jackie.

34:58.889 --> 35:01.433
I'm really gonna miss him.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.393
You know, he sent me clippings
about you all the time.

35:03.477 --> 35:04.770
He was very proud.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.688
Oh, well...

35:06.772 --> 35:09.107
that's really sweet.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.401
- I saved you both seats, but...
- Where is everyone?

35:11.485 --> 35:14.321
Oh, well, I sent the word out.
I went through his phone book,

35:14.321 --> 35:16.240
and the monsignor made
some calls.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.200
Just didn't get much
of a response.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.410
Oh, excuse me.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.455
He saved my clippings.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.960
Chester.

35:29.670 --> 35:31.088
Chester!

35:32.256 --> 35:35.008
What the fuck?

35:35.092 --> 35:36.593
They have onion sandwiches.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.220
Sit.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.138
And don't breathe out.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.309
I didn't think
Jackie thought I was funny.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.522
Well, it's past 3:00 now,

35:48.522 --> 35:49.898
so we should
probably get started.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.484
- I'm keeping this.
- Welcome, everyone.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.236
I want to thank you all
for coming out today

35:54.236 --> 35:56.363
to say goodbye
to one of our favorite sons,

35:56.363 --> 36:00.617
Jacopo "Jackie" Dellapietra.

36:00.701 --> 36:01.910
I'm Monsignor Armanno Ricci

36:01.994 --> 36:03.787
of the Church
of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,

36:03.871 --> 36:05.330
the church that Jackie

36:05.414 --> 36:06.790
was so active in
all of his life.

36:06.874 --> 36:08.208
He went to church?

36:08.292 --> 36:10.586
I've known Jackie
since he was a little boy,

36:10.586 --> 36:12.838
and, well, I would be lying
if I said we didn't find a need

36:12.838 --> 36:15.549
to keep a tight lock
on the altar wine.

36:15.549 --> 36:17.092
Many a morning,

36:17.092 --> 36:18.176
we found
that the blood of Christ

36:18.260 --> 36:20.095
had been replaced
with Dr Pepper.

36:25.434 --> 36:28.020
He was also the first one
to lend a hand.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.230
Now, I can't prove
that he was the one

36:30.314 --> 36:32.190
who built the new platform
for the manger scene

36:32.274 --> 36:34.151
when the old one
got destroyed by vandals,

36:34.151 --> 36:36.194
but I'll bet it was him.

36:36.278 --> 36:39.448
Lots of little stories
about Jackie I could share,

36:39.448 --> 36:41.700
but I think I'm going
to turn the podium over

36:41.700 --> 36:43.327
to someone
who's very special to him.

36:43.327 --> 36:47.706
Someone he always referred to
as one of his closest friends.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.291
Susie?

36:51.168 --> 36:52.711
That's you.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.755
No, he said
one of his closest friends.

36:54.755 --> 36:58.008
Well, unless another Susie
just walked in...

36:58.008 --> 37:01.470
Hey. Tits up.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.685
Uh, hi.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.771
Guess I'm Susie.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.481
And, um,

37:12.481 --> 37:15.692
Nancy asked me to talk,

37:15.776 --> 37:17.361
so...

37:20.197 --> 37:22.199
Fuck this.

37:22.199 --> 37:23.700
Follow me.

37:38.298 --> 37:39.633
Hi.

37:39.633 --> 37:41.802
Sorry.
I'll just be a minute here.

37:41.802 --> 37:44.596
Supposed to say a few words
about Jackie Dellapietra,

37:44.680 --> 37:47.182
who's over there across the hall

37:47.182 --> 37:48.350
in the empty loser room.

37:48.350 --> 37:49.643
But, well, I just...

37:49.643 --> 37:51.812
I can't talk about him
to an empty room.

37:51.812 --> 37:53.021
That's not how it should go.

37:53.105 --> 37:54.898
That's not
how he should be remembered.

37:54.982 --> 37:56.316
Or not remembered.
'Cause apparently,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.860
no one remembered,
because nobody showed up.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.696
Except four people.

38:00.696 --> 38:03.198
Four people to send you off.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.075
Where the fuck was everyone?

38:06.785 --> 38:10.247
A man dies, you show up
at his funeral, right?

38:10.247 --> 38:11.957
This was Jackie.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.542
Mean, he never hurt anyone.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.836
He just... He lived his life.
He did nice things.

38:15.836 --> 38:19.089
He fixed up my shitty apartment.
Put up curtains.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.717
He painted. He made stew.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.969
He built whatever the hell
it was he built

38:23.969 --> 38:25.554
for the fucking monsignor
over there.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.599
Apparently, no one gave a shit.

38:29.683 --> 38:31.935
No one noticed.

38:32.019 --> 38:34.980
Fuck, I lived with the guy,
and I didn't notice.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.149
We slept very close.

38:37.149 --> 38:38.775
I mean, I knew personal things
about the guy.

38:38.859 --> 38:40.027
You know, he snores.

38:40.027 --> 38:41.987
Yeah, certain foods
did not agree with him.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.905
You kept the windows open
on those nights.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.699
I knew his laundry day.

38:45.699 --> 38:47.576
I knew when he cut his hair.
Shit like that.

38:47.576 --> 38:49.953
But I never knew him.

38:50.037 --> 38:52.372
Yeah, I never knew
he fought in the war.

38:52.456 --> 38:53.623
I never knew

38:53.707 --> 38:55.751
he got a medal for bravery.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.294
I mean,
they don't just hand those out.

38:57.294 --> 39:00.172
You got to get shot
or-or save somebody

39:00.172 --> 39:01.757
or blow up a fucking tank.

39:01.757 --> 39:04.801
A medal is a big deal!

39:04.885 --> 39:07.220
He collected <i>Bazooka Joe</i> comics.

39:07.304 --> 39:09.431
He kept the little ticket stubs

39:09.431 --> 39:10.766
to the opera.

39:10.766 --> 39:13.518
He had a baseball
signed by Babe Ruth.

39:13.602 --> 39:14.895
Can you fucking believe that?

39:14.895 --> 39:16.354
Jackie met Babe Ruth.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.398
And he kept it in a shoebox
like an asshole,

39:18.482 --> 39:20.233
but he had it.

39:20.317 --> 39:22.277
I mean, this guy lived a life,

39:22.277 --> 39:24.738
and I never knew any of this.

39:26.740 --> 39:28.617
I mean, it was just a minute ago
I found out I was his friend.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.203
No, I'm sorry,
one of his closest friends.

39:31.203 --> 39:34.456
I had a close friend,
and I never knew it.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.501
And where the fuck is Darla?

39:37.501 --> 39:38.752
Hmm?

39:38.752 --> 39:40.253
She couldn't take off
one afternoon

39:40.337 --> 39:41.588
to come and pay her respects

39:41.588 --> 39:44.800
to a man she wrote
51 fucking idiotic letters to?

39:44.800 --> 39:47.135
A heart over every "I."

39:47.219 --> 39:49.596
What's so important
she couldn't take the time off

39:49.596 --> 39:51.807
to come and give this man
a proper send-off?

39:51.807 --> 39:53.350
She better be dead.

39:54.518 --> 39:56.853
You know
what I really don't understand?

39:56.937 --> 39:59.231
How is it a decent guy,
a guy who worked his ass off

39:59.231 --> 40:00.690
his entire life...

40:00.774 --> 40:02.609
How is it he could barely afford

40:02.609 --> 40:05.195
to sublet the corner
of my shithole apartment?

40:05.195 --> 40:08.281
I mean, he never caught a break.

40:08.365 --> 40:09.407
He never got ahead.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.493
How fucked-up is that?

40:11.493 --> 40:14.037
All these fucking horrible
assholes in the world

40:14.121 --> 40:17.082
that just get shit
handed to them.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.417
And this guy fought in a war.
He traveled.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.253
He... Oh,
he won a Lindy contest.

40:21.253 --> 40:24.172
I didn't know
Jackie could dance.

40:24.256 --> 40:27.092
Half the time, it didn't seem
like he could walk.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.136
But there is
a first-place ribbon

40:29.136 --> 40:32.472
sitting in this fucking
weather-beaten, rat-eaten,

40:32.556 --> 40:35.851
fucked-up, little box
that he shoved in a corner.

40:35.851 --> 40:39.020
A man's life. In a shitty box.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.439
A really good man's life.

40:42.816 --> 40:44.776
You know,
a man who deserved something,

40:44.860 --> 40:46.862
and he wound up
sprinkling sawdust

40:46.862 --> 40:48.405
on vomit at the Gaslight.

40:50.240 --> 40:53.034
Well, this can't continue, okay?

40:53.118 --> 40:54.578
I cannot stand by

40:54.578 --> 40:56.538
and watch this happen
to another poor slob,

40:56.538 --> 40:59.499
so I am dedicating the rest
of my miserable fucking life

40:59.583 --> 41:01.459
to finding
the Jackies of the world.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.837
The ones you walk by.
The ones you don't see.

41:03.837 --> 41:06.089
The ones
who never catch a break.

41:06.173 --> 41:08.508
And I'm gonna make sure
that they never, ever end up

41:08.592 --> 41:11.094
in my fucking apartment!

41:13.889 --> 41:15.974
Oh, and I'm really sorry
about this lady.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.643
I'm sure she was very nice, too.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.616
- Boise. How are you?
- Busy.

41:32.616 --> 41:34.910
- Are things gonna go smoother tonight?
- Hope so.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.995
There'll be a more accurate
run-of-show list?

41:36.995 --> 41:38.371
Maybe Philomena's
wire contraption

41:38.455 --> 41:40.165
- won't cause any major head injuries.
- Run of show?

41:40.165 --> 41:42.209
- Yeah.
- Sexy Angel. Sexy Soviet Spy.

41:42.209 --> 41:43.710
- Sexy Angel. Sexy Spy.
- Roaring '20s. Pouty Poet.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.170
- Roaring '20s. Pouty... Pouty what?
- Cleopatra. Harem Girl.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.796
- Harem Girl. Slow down.
- Sexy Nurse. Cancan Mademoiselle.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.173
- Sexy something. Cancan Mademoiselle.
- Rising Venus.

41:48.173 --> 41:49.841
- Rosie the Riveter.
- You didn't make a list, huh?

41:49.925 --> 41:50.842
- Sailor Girl. China Doll. Sleeping Beauty.
- Rosie Doll.

41:50.926 --> 41:52.177
Sailor Girl.
Boise, Boise, Boise,

41:52.177 --> 41:54.095
I can't memorize all that.
Write it down for me.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.181
I thought I recognized
that unique combination

41:56.181 --> 41:57.641
of lilt and intensity.

42:02.771 --> 42:03.855
What the hell
are you doing here?

42:03.939 --> 42:05.565
Oh, well,
I hate to steal your line,

42:05.649 --> 42:06.983
but what the hell
are you doing here?

42:07.067 --> 42:08.818
You have to leave.
I'm about to go on.

42:08.902 --> 42:11.112
Oh, shit. Are you stripping now?

42:11.196 --> 42:12.989
I knew the Shy Baldwin thing
was tough,

42:13.073 --> 42:15.158
- but there's nicer places.
- I'm the comic.

42:15.242 --> 42:18.078
- Here?
- Yes. And I'm about to go on.

42:18.078 --> 42:21.122
And I'm still honing
and experimenting, so go away.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.499
- You want me to go away?
- Yes.

42:22.499 --> 42:23.875
Because
I would make you nervous.

42:23.959 --> 42:25.919
You would make me nervous.

42:25.919 --> 42:27.712
Don't smile. Bad smile.

42:27.796 --> 42:30.173
I got a story for you.
Back in high school--

42:30.257 --> 42:32.592
Mepham High in Bellmore,
out on Long Island--

42:32.676 --> 42:34.261
I took this speech class.

42:34.261 --> 42:36.221
One day,
the teacher stands me up

42:36.221 --> 42:38.139
in front of everybody
and gives me a topic.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.433
Zoos. Are they good or bad?
Some shit like that.

42:40.517 --> 42:42.018
I was supposed to be
against them.

42:42.102 --> 42:45.230
Told me to take five full
minutes to make my case. Now,

42:45.230 --> 42:47.524
I'm feeling fairly confident
about the subject,

42:47.524 --> 42:49.067
so I start my little spiel,

42:49.067 --> 42:51.444
going on about how animals
shouldn't be in cages

42:51.528 --> 42:52.696
and how we're the real animals

42:52.696 --> 42:54.072
for putting them there
in the first place...

42:54.072 --> 42:55.365
- Mm-hmm.
- ...when all of a sudden,

42:55.365 --> 42:57.575
I get beaned in the head
by an eraser.

42:57.659 --> 43:01.121
I check to see who threw it,
and it was the fucking teacher.

43:01.121 --> 43:02.956
Now, I'm surprised,
to say the least,

43:02.956 --> 43:05.458
but I continue my little speech
with a masterful segue

43:05.542 --> 43:08.295
into the science of evolution
and how we're no less animal

43:08.295 --> 43:09.587
than any other
of God's creatures--

43:09.671 --> 43:11.506
that is, if God exists;
I threw that in--

43:11.506 --> 43:14.759
when another fucking eraser
hits me in the fucking head.

43:14.843 --> 43:16.594
And it's like that
every ten seconds

43:16.678 --> 43:17.971
for the rest of my speech.

43:17.971 --> 43:20.307
Something coming at my head.
Erasers, chalk,

43:20.307 --> 43:21.975
crumpled paper,
a half-eaten apple.

43:21.975 --> 43:24.311
But I soldier on and get through
the five minutes.

43:24.311 --> 43:27.439
Afterwards, I ask my teacher,
"What was that all about?"

43:27.439 --> 43:29.441
And she says, "Mr. Schneider."

43:29.441 --> 43:31.151
For I was Schneider at the time.

43:31.151 --> 43:33.486
"Mr. Schneider,
I was simply training you

43:33.570 --> 43:34.696
to block out distractions.

43:34.696 --> 43:36.489
It's your job to stay focused

43:36.573 --> 43:38.950
despite whatever's coming
at you, and you did good."

43:39.034 --> 43:40.618
This seemed like bullshit
at the time,

43:40.702 --> 43:43.288
but it turned out to be
a very valuable lesson.

43:43.288 --> 43:45.290
It trained me for what I do now.

43:45.290 --> 43:48.168
So, tonight, Mrs. Maisel,

43:48.168 --> 43:51.713
your version of erasers
and chalk and half-eaten apples

43:51.713 --> 43:53.882
will be me staying for your gig.

43:53.882 --> 43:55.759
No. This isn't Bellmore.

43:55.759 --> 43:57.302
Everything is Bellmore.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.637
Mrs. Maisel.
Time to start the show.

43:59.721 --> 44:01.681
I think it's time
to start the show.

44:01.765 --> 44:04.142
Fine. Stay. But do not sit
where I can see you.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.977
Oh, now I'm definitely gonna sit

44:06.061 --> 44:07.312
where you can see me.

44:07.312 --> 44:10.357
Shit.

44:10.357 --> 44:12.942
Mrs. Maisel!

44:13.026 --> 44:15.236
All right!

44:15.320 --> 44:17.655
- Hello.
- Hello there,

44:17.739 --> 44:19.407
not many ladies
and many gentlemen.

44:19.491 --> 44:23.078
I'm Mrs. Maisel, your host
and guide for the evening.

44:23.078 --> 44:25.497
Bravo.

44:25.497 --> 44:28.124
This is a very weird job I have.
I'm a woman

44:28.208 --> 44:29.376
who comes out here
to make men laugh

44:29.376 --> 44:30.960
who are here to see women
take their clothes off.

44:32.337 --> 44:33.838
Easier job for a man.

44:35.757 --> 44:37.342
Yeah!

44:37.342 --> 44:39.969
And a tricky balancing act
for me.

44:40.053 --> 44:41.930
But not as tricky an act
as Sandy,

44:41.930 --> 44:43.848
our stripping contortionist,

44:43.932 --> 44:45.975
who uses
a common household plunger

44:46.059 --> 44:48.019
to balance her... Nah,
I'm not gonna spoil it for you.

44:48.103 --> 44:49.270
Just don't leave
before seeing it.

44:52.690 --> 44:55.485
And what am I supposed to talk
about in between strippers, huh?

44:55.485 --> 44:56.820
Baseball?

44:56.820 --> 44:59.406
Kittens? Grandparents?

45:01.408 --> 45:02.867
I mean, how do you keep
a starving man's interest

45:02.951 --> 45:04.494
when you're performing
between a chocolate doughnut

45:04.494 --> 45:06.079
and a cheeseburger?

45:08.123 --> 45:12.001
Not that you're all
paying attention to me.

45:12.085 --> 45:14.003
See these guys right here?

45:14.087 --> 45:16.506
These guys are ignoring me

45:16.506 --> 45:18.341
and just talking to each other.

45:18.425 --> 45:20.009
What are they talking about?

45:20.093 --> 45:22.178
Just the stuff you'd expect
at a joint like this.

45:22.262 --> 45:25.932
I can hear them, so let me
recreate the conversation.

45:25.932 --> 45:28.184
"You know what I hate worse
than being stuck in traffic

45:28.268 --> 45:29.936
when you got to piss real bad?

45:29.936 --> 45:32.230
The fact that Aristotle
relied so much

45:32.230 --> 45:34.065
on opinions based
on nonscientific reasoning."

45:34.149 --> 45:36.776
"I disagree. I believe a person
can reason perfectly well

45:36.860 --> 45:38.194
in circumstances
where we cannot claim

45:38.278 --> 45:39.446
to have
scientific understanding,

45:39.446 --> 45:41.364
so I defend
the philosopher Aristotle."

45:41.448 --> 45:44.117
"Jesus Christ,
you and your fucking Aristotle.

45:44.117 --> 45:46.494
It's Aristotle this and Aristotle that."

45:46.578 --> 45:48.788
"You know, he buggered young
boys." "It was a different time,

45:48.872 --> 45:50.373
don't you know.
You can't apply modern standards

45:50.457 --> 45:51.416
to ancient figures."

45:51.416 --> 45:52.834
Sidebar. "Gee, Miriam Maisel,

45:52.834 --> 45:54.210
how do you even know
all this stuff about Aristotle?

45:54.294 --> 45:56.087
You seem very girly
with your pretty makeup

45:56.171 --> 45:58.173
and your fashionable hairstyle
and your Park Avenue heels."

45:58.173 --> 46:00.258
And I say, "Well, my father
would read Aristotle to me

46:00.258 --> 46:01.426
as a child, and I absorbed facts

46:01.426 --> 46:02.677
about the old fart
even though I don't know

46:02.677 --> 46:04.053
what the fuck
any of it fucking means."

46:04.137 --> 46:06.181
Didn't mean to interrupt.

46:07.223 --> 46:08.725
Thank you!

46:10.143 --> 46:12.437
See you in a few.

46:33.416 --> 46:35.418
Now that I'm here,
looking at little Akiva,

46:35.502 --> 46:38.671
- I still have no fucking idea who that kid is.
- Me, neither.

46:38.755 --> 46:40.673
- And they got me going last in order.
- Shh.

46:40.757 --> 46:43.009
- It's the best spot.
- Mystery.

46:43.009 --> 46:44.844
Oh, there's Stevie.

46:46.721 --> 46:48.264
Maybe she didn't recognize us.

46:48.348 --> 46:50.350
No, she recognized us.

46:50.350 --> 46:53.937
Look, out of respect for you,
I want you to know.

46:53.937 --> 46:55.647
This? You and me?

46:55.647 --> 46:57.524
I'm not in the market right now.

46:57.524 --> 46:59.817
No matter what Rose Weissman
or my mother told you.

46:59.901 --> 47:01.194
It's not gonna happen.

47:01.194 --> 47:04.405
Excuse me. Buddy,
do we have a problem here?

47:04.489 --> 47:06.282
No. No problem.

47:06.366 --> 47:08.326
Then leave my wife alone?

47:08.326 --> 47:11.329
Oh. Sure. Sorry.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.957
And good Shabbas, by the way.

Sorry for the misunderstanding.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.114
Some signals got crossed
on our end.

47:46.114 --> 47:47.949
Akiva mumbles.
We're working on that.

47:47.949 --> 47:49.576
Oh, sure, sure.
I figured something happened.

47:49.576 --> 47:50.868

my son wouldn't even be able

47:50.952 --> 47:52.161
to pick you out of a lineup.

47:52.245 --> 47:53.580
Hope you didn't practice

47:53.580 --> 47:55.665
Not at all, actually.
Thanks for the heads-up.

47:55.665 --> 47:58.918

48:32.827 --> 48:34.495
Bravery.

48:34.579 --> 48:35.872
Yes, well, uh,

48:35.872 --> 48:39.500
bravery is very interesting,
Akiva, and very noble.

48:39.584 --> 48:43.129
But is it as important as...

48:43.129 --> 48:45.590
loyalty?

48:45.590 --> 48:47.175
I-I guess.

48:47.175 --> 48:48.760
Papa, what did you do
to the rabbi?

48:48.760 --> 48:51.512
- I did nothing to the rabbi.
- But, um,

48:51.596 --> 48:53.306
no one's braver
than my Uncle Saul.

48:53.306 --> 48:55.224
He helped liberate
the Jews of Auschwitz

48:55.308 --> 48:58.436
and now owns three restaurants,
one of them dine-in.

48:58.436 --> 49:01.648
But one must keep in mind
how important it is

49:01.648 --> 49:03.232
for a community such as ours

49:03.316 --> 49:06.569
to be loyal to each other.

49:09.989 --> 49:11.991
Do I have something on my shirt?

49:12.075 --> 49:13.534
Shame on you, Abe Weissman.

49:13.618 --> 49:16.204
- What did I do?
- Poor, innocent Buzz.

49:16.204 --> 49:17.705
Oh.

49:17.789 --> 49:19.415
What did you do to Buzz?

49:19.499 --> 49:21.334
Your husband
killed his show.

49:21.334 --> 49:25.380
Wrote horrible things about it
in that <i>farkakte</i> paper of his.

49:25.380 --> 49:27.924
It was the boy's life's work.

49:27.924 --> 49:31.010
The <i>Village Voice</i>
is not my paper.

49:31.094 --> 49:33.721
- Papa, what did you write?
- I wrote what I saw.

49:35.223 --> 49:37.058
You should be ashamed,
Abe Weissman.

49:37.058 --> 49:38.810
Look, people,

49:38.810 --> 49:41.270
I am a journalist.

49:41.354 --> 49:44.273
And sometimes, writing
a bad review is part of my job.

49:44.357 --> 49:46.776
It's what I owe the public.

49:46.776 --> 49:49.362
So, please,
let's have some respect

49:49.362 --> 49:53.074
and give the floor back
to Rabbi Huebsche.

49:53.074 --> 49:54.701
What's more important, Abraham,

49:54.701 --> 49:57.662
- your public or your people?
- Yeah!

49:57.662 --> 50:00.623
We escaped the jaws of Hitler for this?

50:00.707 --> 50:03.584
Slander. That's what he wrote.
Lies and slander!

50:03.668 --> 50:06.003
Abe, what is this review?
What did you write?

50:06.087 --> 50:08.673
Here. See for yourself.

50:08.673 --> 50:11.384
I talked to Buzz last night,
and he was inconsolable.

50:11.384 --> 50:13.761
Says he wished he'd drowned
in the lake that day.

50:13.845 --> 50:16.097
He would have
if I hadn't saved him.

50:16.097 --> 50:17.598
- Just to kill him again?
- "To watch

50:17.682 --> 50:20.351
<i>They Came, They Danced</i>
is to reside in hell.

50:20.435 --> 50:22.729
I felt an anger and despair
I had not felt

50:22.729 --> 50:24.105
since I was a young man realizing

50:24.105 --> 50:27.066
that the American dream
came with an enormous asterisk."

50:27.150 --> 50:29.152
- Oh, Papa.
- What?

50:29.152 --> 50:32.905
I'm paid to speak the truth.
I'm paid to be honest.

50:32.989 --> 50:34.073
Were you this honest
when your daughter

50:34.157 --> 50:35.491
stunk up the show in '53?

50:35.575 --> 50:37.744
Now, once and for all, people,

50:37.744 --> 50:39.495
I may not be Mary Martin
or Jessica Tandy,

50:39.579 --> 50:42.957
but I was a decent Clare,
and I did not stink up the show.

50:42.957 --> 50:45.001
My singing isn't perfect,
but in musical theater,

50:45.001 --> 50:47.086
character is more important
than technique.

50:47.170 --> 50:48.713
Abe Weissman,

50:48.713 --> 50:51.340
you stood there,
sipping champagne,

50:51.424 --> 50:54.010
making small talk,
quoting Oscar Wilde,

50:54.010 --> 50:56.512
hugging Buzz, toasting Buzz,

50:56.596 --> 50:59.807
all while holding the knife
of Cain behind your back.

50:59.891 --> 51:02.435
Oh, Pauly, don't be so dramatic.

51:02.435 --> 51:03.644
You're the only one
who can speak truth?

51:03.728 --> 51:05.021
Truth, huh? Truth?

51:05.021 --> 51:07.190
Well, there's nothing
in the Hebrew Bible

51:07.190 --> 51:10.067
indicating that Cain killed Abel
with a knife.

51:10.151 --> 51:11.569
So much for your truth.

51:11.569 --> 51:13.237
Yes, there is.
The Book of Genesis.

51:13.321 --> 51:14.530
Cain killed Abel.

51:14.614 --> 51:16.699
And it's implied
it was with a knife.

51:16.783 --> 51:17.950
Rabbi, chime in here.

51:18.034 --> 51:19.494
The Torah says that Cain

51:19.494 --> 51:21.704
- was a worker of the ground.
- Exactly.

51:21.788 --> 51:25.541
So it was most likely a hoe
or a trowel.

51:25.625 --> 51:27.376
He didn't carry a knife.

51:27.460 --> 51:28.628
And not that you care,

51:28.628 --> 51:31.464
but my hard-earned nest egg
is kaput.

51:31.464 --> 51:33.716
You said you invested
a small slice, Pauly.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.384
Don't exaggerate for effect.

51:35.468 --> 51:37.261
Small for the show, big for me.

51:37.345 --> 51:38.763
You know,
the show was not very good.

51:38.763 --> 51:40.097
What are you talking about?

51:40.181 --> 51:43.434
- Maybe it was good.
- I was nice in this review.

51:43.518 --> 51:47.271
I very kindly used the show
to talk about the rot

51:47.355 --> 51:49.106
at the heart
of the American theater

51:49.190 --> 51:51.025
instead of listing
all its faults.

51:51.025 --> 51:52.276
What about the song?

51:52.360 --> 51:55.238
It has one good song. That's it.

51:55.238 --> 51:59.033
You can't have a musical
with one good song.

51:59.033 --> 52:00.785
And I don't know why you're

52:00.785 --> 52:03.371
on their side. That character
you loved to hate?

52:03.371 --> 52:06.582
The rude, hectoring busybody?
It's you.

52:06.666 --> 52:09.085
- I beg your pardon.
- Her name

52:09.085 --> 52:11.170
was Iris. Rose, Iris.

52:11.254 --> 52:13.464
She sipped sherry,

52:13.548 --> 52:15.633
had a fortune-teller, two kids.

52:15.633 --> 52:18.427
You ruined the show,
and now you've ruined

52:18.511 --> 52:21.180
- poor Akiva's bar mitzvah.
- Yeah.

52:21.264 --> 52:23.683
I wish I hadn't invited you,
Mr. Weissman.

52:23.683 --> 52:25.476
No offense,
but there were a lot of problems

52:25.560 --> 52:27.562
- with your invite list, kid.
- So you didn't like it.

52:27.562 --> 52:29.480
Fine. You have to kill it
for everyone else?

52:29.564 --> 52:31.274
It's a nice little show.
It isn't doing any harm.

52:31.274 --> 52:34.443
It is. Because out there,
there's a great show

52:34.527 --> 52:37.905
that isn't getting the resources
it needs to be seen.

52:37.989 --> 52:39.949
- What show?
- What do you mean,

52:39.949 --> 52:41.450
- what show?
- What show?

52:41.534 --> 52:42.952
What's this great show
that's sitting out there

52:42.952 --> 52:44.495
with no resources and no money?

52:44.579 --> 52:46.289
There's ten shows out there

52:46.289 --> 52:49.000
that could use resources. Twenty.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.543
- What are the 20 shows?
- He's saying

52:50.543 --> 52:52.712
that if you give to one thing,
you're taking from another.

52:52.712 --> 52:54.797
This from the girl
who stunk up the Catskills

52:54.881 --> 52:56.674
- with her ham acting.
- Who said that?!

52:56.674 --> 52:59.093
Don't hide! Who said that?!

52:59.093 --> 53:01.053
Stop, everybody. Stop.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.472
I am a distraction.

53:03.556 --> 53:06.309
And, apparently,
an enemy of the people.

53:06.309 --> 53:08.269
So I will leave

53:08.269 --> 53:10.605
so that you can carry on
with your ceremony.

53:13.649 --> 53:17.278
But there is something you all
need to know going forward.

53:17.278 --> 53:20.156
You are the frog.

53:20.156 --> 53:23.075
I am the scorpion.

53:23.159 --> 53:27.079
I sting because it is my nature.

53:35.046 --> 53:37.632
Damn, I wish I had my cape.

53:39.133 --> 53:41.260
So what
if I make demands?

53:41.344 --> 53:44.347
I mean, how hard is it
to make room-temperature water?

53:44.347 --> 53:46.349
It's the temperature
of the room.

53:46.349 --> 53:48.351
Hey, do we know a Mr. Fibbi?

53:48.351 --> 53:50.269
Fibbi?
What kind of name is that?

53:50.353 --> 53:53.564
It says, "4:30. Mr. Fibbi
called. Will call back."

53:53.648 --> 53:54.815
Doesn't ring a bell.

53:54.899 --> 53:57.151
Zelda never takes
the first name.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.569
I keep telling her to do that.

53:58.653 --> 54:00.905
The staff at Steiner
always seemed so happy

54:00.905 --> 54:03.032
to have their mistakes corrected.

54:03.032 --> 54:05.493
And there is a certain way
to cut a grapefruit.

54:05.493 --> 54:08.037
God made those segments
for a reason.

54:08.037 --> 54:10.581
Hello? <i>- Abe. It's Asher.</i>

54:10.665 --> 54:13.125
Asher. This is a surprise.

54:13.209 --> 54:16.504
Really? I'm a little surprised
that you're surprised.

54:16.504 --> 54:18.798
<i>- Why?</i>
- Well,

54:18.798 --> 54:21.634
a friend sent me
this thing you wrote

54:21.634 --> 54:23.386
in the, uh, <i>Village Voice.</i>

54:23.386 --> 54:27.223
You review a show.
<i>They Came, They Danced.</i>

54:27.223 --> 54:29.767
<i>- Sounds like a piece of shit.</i>
- That's putting it mildly.

54:29.767 --> 54:33.145
<i>And then you got
a little nostalgic at the end</i>

54:33.229 --> 54:34.939
with the asterisk
and the American dream,

54:34.939 --> 54:37.316
which segued very nicely

54:37.400 --> 54:40.695
into something the two of us did
back in the '20s.

54:40.695 --> 54:42.446
My editor likes me
to get personal.

54:42.530 --> 54:43.948
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

54:43.948 --> 54:47.660
But did he like the fact
that you fingered the two of us

54:47.660 --> 54:50.413
for a federal fucking crime,
Abe?!

54:50.413 --> 54:53.165
What are you talking about? <i>- The nifty little paragraph</i>

54:53.249 --> 54:55.001
<i>about art and anarchy</i>

54:55.001 --> 54:57.253
where you describe very vividly

54:57.253 --> 55:00.881
how you and I
set a federal building on fire.

55:00.965 --> 55:03.634
Oh, that was years ago.
No one cares.

55:03.718 --> 55:06.012
<i>- The FBI does.</i>
- What?

55:06.012 --> 55:08.889
They want to see us in the
New York field office next week.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.891
The FBI hasn't contacted me.

55:10.975 --> 55:12.727
<i>They will. Trust me.</i>

55:12.727 --> 55:14.437
So kiss your loved ones goodbye

55:14.437 --> 55:16.897
and grab your toothbrush, Abe,
because you and I are gonna be

55:16.981 --> 55:18.858
breaking rocks at Leavenworth.

55:18.858 --> 55:20.359
Which is gonna be hell
on my gout.

55:20.443 --> 55:21.736
<i>- See you in New York.</i>
- Asher...

55:36.834 --> 55:38.544
Mr. Fibbi.

56:10.076 --> 56:12.161
To Jackie.

56:12.161 --> 56:14.914
A man who didn't
suffer fools gladly

56:14.914 --> 56:17.750
and thought everyone was a fool.

56:17.750 --> 56:20.544
A man whose love of ocarinas
summed up his total

56:20.628 --> 56:22.129
lack of musical taste.

56:22.213 --> 56:24.924
A man who borrowed ten bucks
from me the day before he died,

56:24.924 --> 56:27.510
because somehow he knew.

56:30.054 --> 56:32.181
A man who knew how to drive me
crazier than any person

56:32.181 --> 56:34.266
in this fucking world,
except you.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.938
A man who was... my friend.

56:40.397 --> 56:42.525
- To Jackie.
- To Jackie.
