00:07.921 --> 00:10.788
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Carla.

00:10.962 --> 00:13.332
Sam, l'm sorry l'm late.

00:13.504 --> 00:16.667
l realise l left you here
without a waitress.

00:18.378 --> 00:20.416
What am l? Chopped liver?

00:20.587 --> 00:23.419
No, some people enjoy chopped liver.

00:25.878 --> 00:30.167
- What got you in such a bad mood?
- l don't know. Everything.

00:30.336 --> 00:35.372
This morning l was thinking l'm not
married, l'm carrying my sixth kid.

00:35.544 --> 00:38.210
l'm broke, l live in squalor...

00:39.835 --> 00:43.201
- l'm having a crisis of faith.
- Don't talk like that.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.707
Would a just God
be putting me through this?

00:46.876 --> 00:50.241
Well, l know it looks
sort of bleak out there.

00:50.417 --> 00:53.534
But you just have to have patience.
Remember Job.

00:53.709 --> 00:57.749
Cliffie's right, honey.
You got a good Job here.

01:00.292 --> 01:04.037
- You're in great health...
- l don't know.

01:05.875 --> 01:08.789
l didn't want to embarrass you
in front of Carla,

01:08.958 --> 01:11.956
but you pronounce the word ''job''.

02:31.662 --> 02:34.197
Frasier, what a surprise
to see you here.

02:34.370 --> 02:36.858
Diane, l've got the most exciting news.

02:37.036 --> 02:39.489
What is it? You're positively tingling.

02:39.661 --> 02:41.284
Sit down.

02:41.453 --> 02:45.660
l have been awarded an honour that
surpasses anything l've hoped for.

02:45.828 --> 02:48.990
lt goes beyond even my most wild
and ambitious dreams.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.198
Are we talking Nobel Prize?

02:51.369 --> 02:54.071
- No, we're not talking Nobel Prize.
- A Pulitzer?

02:54.244 --> 02:57.276
- Not the Pulitzer Prize.
- A Guggenheim Fellowship.

02:57.451 --> 03:02.358
- No, it's not a Guggenheim Fellowship.
- A canned ham? You lost the big ones.

03:04.035 --> 03:06.238
l knew l should have waited.

03:06.409 --> 03:09.821
Diane, l have been chosen to be
this year's visiting scholar

03:09.992 --> 03:11.864
at the University of Bologna.

03:13.326 --> 03:18.231
- Frasier, that's wonderful.
- The University of Bologna?

03:18.408 --> 03:23.030
l can't believe they need a university
for a thing like that.

03:24.450 --> 03:27.650
- l know it's a complicated meat, but...
- Coach.

03:29.991 --> 03:33.936
The University of Bologna
is the oldest university in the world.

03:34.116 --> 03:38.690
lt has what is arguably the finest
school of psychology in Europe.

03:38.866 --> 03:40.986
Now inarguably the finest.

03:41.157 --> 03:43.610
Who's the dean, Oscar Mayer?

03:49.490 --> 03:53.020
l hear sausage jokes
are making a comeback.

03:54.115 --> 03:56.401
Now here's the exciting news.

03:57.781 --> 04:01.821
My teaching load will provide us
ample time to travel throughout Europe.

04:02.822 --> 04:05.062
- Us?
- l thought you'd notice that.

04:05.239 --> 04:09.363
l'm leaving in two weeks
and l'd love for you to come along.

04:11.655 --> 04:14.653
Why, that would be wonderful,
wouldn't it?

04:15.738 --> 04:20.027
- How long would we be gone?
- Six months.

04:22.279 --> 04:27.102
This would be a very big undertaking.
So many details to take care of.

04:27.279 --> 04:30.479
My apartment, a passport.

04:30.653 --> 04:35.358
My plants, my classes, Sam,
paper, my dry-cleaning.

04:35.529 --> 04:38.729
- Sam?
- Well, yes.

04:38.904 --> 04:43.690
You know what a devastating effect
it had on him the last time l left.

04:43.861 --> 04:46.943
He's fragile. He can be wounded.

04:48.403 --> 04:50.476
Hey, Doc.

04:50.652 --> 04:53.401
Ever seen a guy
do push-ups with his tongue?

04:53.569 --> 04:56.602
- Well, no, l haven't.
- Watch this.

05:08.069 --> 05:12.606
You see, Diane? Even without you
his life is very full.

05:13.693 --> 05:15.932
Frasier, l'm serious.

05:16.109 --> 05:20.352
All right. l was Sam's therapist.
l'll tell him and observe his reaction.

05:20.526 --> 05:24.851
lf he shows any anxiety whatsoever,
l'll be here to assuage it.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.225
- Can l have a word with you?
- Sure, Doc. What's up?

05:28.400 --> 05:32.725
- Diane and l are going to Europe.
- Europe? Overseas?

05:32.900 --> 05:38.185
Well, we were going to go to
the local one, but it's all booked up.

05:38.358 --> 05:43.180
l'm going to be teaching there for six
months and Diane is going with me.

05:43.357 --> 05:46.225
And you may never see her again.

05:46.399 --> 05:49.231
Well, that's... l'm happy for you guys.

05:49.399 --> 05:53.523
Maybe l should throw you a <i>bon</i>
<i>voyage</i> party. What do you think?

05:53.732 --> 05:57.227
- You're not bothered?
- Not bothered? How delightfully naive.

05:57.398 --> 06:00.182
He's repressing. Come along, Sam.

06:00.356 --> 06:04.563
- l want to have a little chat with you.
- What are we going to talk about?

06:04.731 --> 06:07.433
The emotions that you're
repressing right now.

06:07.606 --> 06:12.228
l'm here for you and l won't leave
until you can deal with this.

06:12.397 --> 06:17.552
She doesn't want to go to Europe.
She's still harbouring feelings for you.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.886
- Come on, Frasier. That again?
- Yes.

06:22.064 --> 06:26.104
You should have seen the look on
her face when l asked her just now.

06:27.313 --> 06:31.437
She is a great cure
for happiness, isn't she?

06:31.605 --> 06:36.759
You can't expect her to jump up
and down with joy right off the bat.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.019
- l'd love to know why.
- Because Diane is Diane.

06:40.188 --> 06:43.517
She's never done anything
without thinking about it.

06:43.687 --> 06:45.926
She analyses everything.

06:46.103 --> 06:49.303
lf you were to say,
''Can l offer you a million dollars?''

06:49.478 --> 06:53.935
she'd say, ''No, no, no. That's
may l offer you a million dollars?'''

06:55.603 --> 06:58.803
l admit she does have
a tendency to be cerebral.

06:58.978 --> 07:01.382
l never pictured myself in a relationship

07:01.561 --> 07:05.140
where l would be
the wild and impulsive one.

07:07.185 --> 07:10.847
Let's be fair, though. She does know
how to show a man a good time.

07:11.018 --> 07:16.221
You're right. We'd be out and she'd say,
''Look. Those guys are having fun.''

07:16.394 --> 07:18.763
Come on. l'll bet she comes around.

07:18.935 --> 07:23.675
l bet she's outside right now thinking
this whole Europe thing's a good idea.

07:23.851 --> 07:26.884
- You really think so?
- Yeah, l know so.

07:27.059 --> 07:29.512
- How is he?
- He'll be all right.

07:31.601 --> 07:34.552
- l already got my sense of humour back.
- Good man.

07:35.517 --> 07:38.882
Sam, you were really bothered
by this news?

07:43.183 --> 07:46.347
l just used Sam as a cover. lt was me.

07:46.516 --> 07:50.177
l was hurt that your reaction to
my Europe news was half-hearted.

07:53.182 --> 07:56.880
Well, l've had a little time
to think about it now.

07:57.057 --> 08:00.589
And l want you to know that
Europe sounds wonderful.

08:00.766 --> 08:03.764
l can't imagine a more romantic place

08:03.932 --> 08:06.846
or a more appropriate person
with whom to share it.

08:07.015 --> 08:08.922
That's wonderful.

08:09.099 --> 08:11.135
Sam said you'd come around.

08:13.473 --> 08:15.510
Lucky guess.

08:17.348 --> 08:19.883
Dear, may l have
a moment alone with Sam?

08:20.056 --> 08:22.509
Certainly. l'm late
for my session as it is.

08:22.681 --> 08:24.719
Bye-bye, Sam.

08:31.264 --> 08:33.299
How l hate you.

08:36.263 --> 08:39.960
l'd love to smack that smug look
off your face.

08:41.804 --> 08:44.672
You're pretending not to care
because you believe

08:44.846 --> 08:49.254
that Europe will be the death-knell for
my relationship with Frasier Crane.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.549
Either because l won't go at all

08:51.720 --> 08:56.841
or because the stress of travelling
together for six months will break us up.

08:57.011 --> 09:00.175
- Right?
- Listen to me.

09:00.345 --> 09:03.841
l'm sincere about this. l like you two.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.044
And l want to see you both happy.

09:09.428 --> 09:11.217
Thank you, Sam.

09:11.386 --> 09:14.550
After all, just because
us two didn't travel well...

09:14.719 --> 09:18.665
- When did we ever travel?
- Are you kidding me?

09:18.844 --> 09:21.463
We went through hell together.

09:24.302 --> 09:27.881
Well, it helped that
you knew the language.

09:33.343 --> 09:36.009
What are you looking for?
A sign from God?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.332
Religious belief is based on faith.

09:38.510 --> 09:42.289
l never thought l'd say this, Coach,
but l think l've lost faith.

09:42.468 --> 09:45.169
Listen up.
l have an announcement to make.

09:45.342 --> 09:49.252
Diane here is leaving for Europe
and she's not going to be back ever.

09:51.176 --> 09:57.503
l believe for every drop of rain
that falls a flower grows.

09:57.675 --> 10:04.085
l believe that somewhere
in the darkest night a candle glows.

10:10.674 --> 10:13.589
You know, Sam, l got to tell you.

10:14.257 --> 10:17.670
l can't see Diane
going off with Doc like that.

10:17.840 --> 10:21.620
l always figured that you and her
would get married, you know?

10:21.799 --> 10:24.666
- Come on, Coach.
- l'm not kidding.

10:24.839 --> 10:31.334
l pictured you moving to a little home in
the country with a rose garden out front

10:31.506 --> 10:33.994
and a nice little room
in the back for me.

10:36.756 --> 10:41.413
Every Sunday night Diane would
make us a fried chicken dinner

10:41.588 --> 10:44.705
and we'd sit on the porch
and listen to the ball game.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.664
l'd bounce your kids on my knee...

10:47.838 --> 10:50.373
God, it was going to be a happy house.

10:51.255 --> 10:54.087
l guess that's going to be
Frasier's house now.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.578
Well, you can come by any time, Sam.

10:58.963 --> 11:01.000
But call first.

11:04.087 --> 11:07.417
- Let's get out of here. lt's late.
- Time to go for the night.

11:07.587 --> 11:09.624
Good night, guys.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.290
- Later, Sammy.
- See you.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.408
l'm not a sentimental guy, you know.

11:16.586 --> 11:19.501
l'd like you to... have a good safe trip.

11:21.336 --> 11:25.709
You big monkey, don't you ever
be ashamed of your tender side.

11:29.961 --> 11:31.750
Goodbye, Diane.

11:31.918 --> 11:33.956
Goodbye, Clifford.

11:37.626 --> 11:41.158
Come on, you two. l'm waiting for a kiss.

11:43.043 --> 11:46.206
Well... she is leaving.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.121
Did you see the look on her face?

11:59.833 --> 12:03.116
l was more worried about
the look on your face.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.203
Well, Diane.

12:10.667 --> 12:15.489
l'm not going to pretend that you're
my favourite person in the world.

12:15.666 --> 12:17.704
But now that it's all over...

12:19.041 --> 12:21.115
l guess l wish you a happy life.

12:22.165 --> 12:24.489
Thank you.

12:24.666 --> 12:26.288
And...

12:28.707 --> 12:30.744
l thought l'd do you a favour,

12:30.915 --> 12:33.581
so l wrote down
a helpful phrase in ltalian.

12:33.748 --> 12:36.532
You carry that with you
wherever you go.

12:41.373 --> 12:45.745
lt means, ''Excuse me, Mr Pharmacist.
Where do you keep the peroxide?''

12:50.122 --> 12:52.160
Meet you at the car, Coach.

12:57.038 --> 13:00.155
- l'm going to miss you.
- l'm going to miss you, too.

13:00.330 --> 13:03.079
Listen. Thank you for coming back.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.615
Will he be OK?

13:08.788 --> 13:12.781
- Well, l hope so.
- Coach, do me a favour.

13:12.954 --> 13:15.786
- Sure.
- Stand by him.

13:19.870 --> 13:21.908
Come back.

13:25.453 --> 13:30.524
lnstead of standing by him,
why don't you just sort of...

13:30.703 --> 13:33.155
- watch over him?
- Of course.

13:34.453 --> 13:36.490
Bye, sweetheart.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.320
Well.

13:58.201 --> 14:02.277
- We haven't been alone for a long time.
- No.

14:03.326 --> 14:07.450
- Funny how things change, isn't it?
- Yes.

14:09.659 --> 14:12.740
l still remember the first time
l came in here.

14:15.909 --> 14:18.527
What a prissy little snot l was.

14:21.116 --> 14:24.031
Yeah. Who would have thought
it could get worse?

14:29.074 --> 14:30.780
Listen to me.

14:30.949 --> 14:35.108
We both realise that a lot of things
can happen when you leave like this.

14:35.282 --> 14:38.150
Who knows
when we'll see each other again?

14:38.324 --> 14:40.859
- Do me a favour.
- What's that, Sam?

14:41.698 --> 14:45.278
l've been a real jerk to you sometimes.

14:45.449 --> 14:48.399
But l'd appreciate it if,
when you think of me,

14:48.573 --> 14:50.610
you remember me
as a decent person.

14:51.739 --> 14:53.647
Of course.

14:53.823 --> 14:56.691
l'll remember you as Albert Schweitzer.

14:58.447 --> 15:00.734
l'd like that. Thank you.

15:04.072 --> 15:07.687
l'm so glad it's ending this way.

15:07.864 --> 15:11.608
After the wrath and acrimony
of our breakup.

15:12.571 --> 15:16.316
l thought l'd never
see you come in here again.

15:17.737 --> 15:20.440
- Do you know why l came back?
- Sure.

15:20.612 --> 15:23.101
Cos you're a woman and l'm Sammy.

15:27.487 --> 15:32.310
Actually, it was because
l was concerned about you.

15:32.487 --> 15:35.058
Your drinking and your health.

15:36.278 --> 15:40.402
Well...thank you.
Because it did make a difference.

15:45.528 --> 15:50.231
Who would have thought that we'd
ever be standing here as friends?

15:50.402 --> 15:54.561
- We are friends, aren't we?
- Good friends.

15:58.318 --> 16:01.102
Well, l'm off.

16:01.277 --> 16:02.438
Wait.

16:02.610 --> 16:05.561
Let me give my...friend
a goodbye hug.

16:06.943 --> 16:08.981
Come on. Get over here.

16:19.734 --> 16:21.606
What?

16:21.776 --> 16:26.017
This really may be the last time
we see each other.

16:28.858 --> 16:30.730
Well.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.690
Goodbye, pal.

16:34.524 --> 16:36.978
Goodbye, buddy.

16:37.150 --> 16:39.555
Bye, <i>amigo.</i>

16:41.150 --> 16:43.768
Goodbye, <i>mon ami.</i>

16:43.941 --> 16:45.978
Goodbye, <i>compadre.</i>

16:48.107 --> 16:50.856
Well, that's that.

16:51.024 --> 16:54.768
- l'll be off.
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.

16:56.856 --> 16:58.894
You too, Sam.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.852
- Sam?
- Yeah, chum?

17:08.981 --> 17:11.848
l'm going to count to three
and then we'll stop.

17:12.022 --> 17:14.392
You got it.

17:15.521 --> 17:17.063
One.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.061
Two.

17:20.230 --> 17:22.220
Two-and-a-half.

17:23.146 --> 17:25.184
Which leads us to three.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.683
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?

17:32.813 --> 17:35.099
l think we just counted to three.

17:39.271 --> 17:41.308
You have a nice safe trip.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.141
Thank you.

17:53.103 --> 17:56.966
How could we have ever
denied ourselves for so long?

17:57.144 --> 17:58.851
Come on.

17:59.019 --> 18:02.017
- Let's go back to my place.
- Come on, Sam.

18:02.186 --> 18:04.260
Let's go back to your place.

18:04.436 --> 18:07.138
We have to make up for
a lot of lost time.

18:14.769 --> 18:17.518
- Sam, wait.
- What?

18:19.351 --> 18:23.297
l knew you couldn't be spontaneous.
l knew you'd over-analyse this.

18:23.476 --> 18:25.514
What is it?

18:26.351 --> 18:29.966
l was just going to say
l almost forgot my purse.

18:35.642 --> 18:38.592
Well, let me get that for you, sweetheart.

18:43.058 --> 18:46.803
- What did you think l was going to say?
- That was it.

18:48.100 --> 18:51.595
- What did you think l was going to say?
- l don't know.

18:51.766 --> 18:54.883
l thought you were going to say,
''ls this just for tonight

18:55.058 --> 18:57.890
''or are we going to
start this whole thing over again?''

18:58.057 --> 19:01.055
- l wasn't going to say that.
- Bless you.

19:02.348 --> 19:04.884
- But now that you've brought it up...
- Damn.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.805
l didn't bring it up,
l was just saying that

19:07.973 --> 19:11.220
as an example
of something we'd never say.

19:11.390 --> 19:14.920
No, Sam, l'm glad you said it.

19:15.723 --> 19:19.633
What exactly is it you have in mind?
ls it a beginning or an ending?

19:19.806 --> 19:22.128
Hello or goodbye?

19:22.306 --> 19:27.295
One night of passion or something
that will last beyond tomorrow?

19:27.472 --> 19:30.588
This conversation
will last beyond tomorrow.

19:30.763 --> 19:33.964
Just a minute ago
we were hot for each other.

19:34.139 --> 19:37.385
l wasn't hot. l was insane.

19:38.055 --> 19:39.761
l was insane.

19:39.929 --> 19:44.254
l was about to abandon the most
brilliant, sensitive man l ever met

19:44.429 --> 19:48.292
for one with the morals of
a rutting sea-elephant...

19:49.845 --> 19:53.211
and the intelligence of lint.

19:54.595 --> 19:59.004
Let's just stop right there before
we start insulting each other.

19:59.179 --> 20:02.341
Good idea, Sam. Goodbye.

20:06.178 --> 20:07.588
Please.

20:08.761 --> 20:12.043
Maybe Frasier can give you

20:12.219 --> 20:16.164
an iron-clad guarantee
of a lifetime of security.

20:17.344 --> 20:20.590
But with me it's a day at a time.

20:22.218 --> 20:24.789
Now if you can live with that...

20:24.968 --> 20:26.378
call.

20:51.175 --> 20:54.623
Last l saw,
you and Diane were here alone.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.253
Did you give her a goodbye boink?

21:03.175 --> 21:07.002
Your language. l haven't heard you
talk like that in a long time.

21:07.174 --> 21:11.832
l know, but this morning
after mass the priest said

21:12.007 --> 21:17.505
that he didn't think that Diane's going to
Bologna constituted a true miracle.

21:17.673 --> 21:22.461
l told him l had witnesses. He said
he wouldn't even take it to the bishop.

21:23.756 --> 21:26.079
To answer your question...

21:26.256 --> 21:29.704
Nothing happened
between me and Diane.

21:29.881 --> 21:32.666
She wanted to, but...you know.

21:33.339 --> 21:36.539
- You OK?
- l'm fine.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.294
Cheers.

21:41.463 --> 21:44.461
No, sorry, Diane's not here.

21:44.630 --> 21:48.244
Oh, you're Diane?
Then you're definitely not here.

21:48.421 --> 21:51.621
No, he's right here. Sam, it's Diane.

21:54.421 --> 21:56.992
l was hoping you'd call.

21:57.171 --> 22:00.501
l'm in a hotel room in London, Sam.

22:00.671 --> 22:03.242
Hold on one second.

22:08.962 --> 22:12.541
Frasier and l are stopping over
on our way to ltaly.

22:12.712 --> 22:15.378
So why are you calling?

22:15.545 --> 22:21.494
Well, l'm calling because l've had
some time to think about last night.

22:21.669 --> 22:26.291
We both had a moment of weakness
and l'm glad we didn't give in to it.

22:26.461 --> 22:28.664
But l hope we're still friends.

22:30.502 --> 22:33.749
l don't think we're friends, Diane.

22:35.377 --> 22:40.329
We failed as lovers. lf we're not friends,
what have we been these past months?

22:40.501 --> 22:42.705
We've been kidding ourselves.

22:43.959 --> 22:46.992
- Goodbye, Diane.
- Wait. Sam?

22:49.709 --> 22:52.280
Nothing. Bye.

22:53.501 --> 22:55.538
Before you hang up here...

22:57.000 --> 22:59.122
They got postcards in Europe?

23:00.167 --> 23:02.951
l'm almost sure of it.

23:05.291 --> 23:08.704
Maybe if you think of it
you can send me one.

23:08.875 --> 23:13.745
Write small. You know how l like to
read in between the lines.

23:15.208 --> 23:18.241
- l'll try.
- That'd be nice.

23:19.624 --> 23:21.661
Thank you, Sam.

23:22.541 --> 23:24.577
Goodbye, Diane.
