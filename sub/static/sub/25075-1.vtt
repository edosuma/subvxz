01:24.166 --> 01:25.133
Yeah!

01:50.633 --> 01:52.266
How'd it go?

01:52.300 --> 01:55.300
Oh, I think the people who
enjoyed it the most...

01:55.333 --> 01:57.300
were the ones who caught up
on their sleep.

01:57.333 --> 02:01.266
Er, Laura and the kids have
started eating.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.700
Where'd they go?

02:02.733 --> 02:05.400
Er... er, La Petit Vérité.

02:05.433 --> 02:09.433
Oh. Man, Jesus.

02:09.466 --> 02:10.765
You're not in the mood
for French food?

02:10.800 --> 02:14.033
No, it's not that, it's just...

02:14.066 --> 02:15.400
Are you‐‐ are you okay?

02:15.433 --> 02:18.233
No, I‐‐ I‐‐ you know,
it's just...

02:18.266 --> 02:20.100
I mean, I don't get the idea
of drama.

02:20.133 --> 02:23.500
I mean, it doesn't make
people happy, right?

02:23.533 --> 02:25.566
Er, and‐‐ and you know,
like people‐‐

02:25.600 --> 02:29.333
I know there's some people who‐‐
who, er, feel stuck in comedy...

02:29.366 --> 02:31.600
and they wanna prove themselves
a serious actor.

02:31.633 --> 02:33.400
I don't.

02:33.433 --> 02:36.300
I mean, I love doing comedy.
I love making people laugh.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.166
I‐‐ I don't feel like I need
to win an award...

02:39.200 --> 02:41.333
for long day's journey into
boredom, you know?

02:41.366 --> 02:44.266
And yet here I am, doing another
drama.

02:44.300 --> 02:47.333
You know, like a guy who‐‐
who's, er, you know...

02:47.366 --> 02:50.400
addicted to a drug that doesn't
even get him high, you know?

02:50.433 --> 02:52.633
Like a cigarette smoker
who doesn't even...

02:52.666 --> 02:54.366
like cigarettes, you know?

02:54.400 --> 02:57.133
And yet, here he goes, having
another cigarette...

02:57.166 --> 02:59.133
and another cigarette and
another cigarette...

02:59.166 --> 03:01.600
and another cigarette.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.266
I get the idea, Woody.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.733
Have you ever had that...

03:04.766 --> 03:07.666
where you were addicted to
something you didn't even like?

03:07.700 --> 03:09.566
Yeah, my girlfriend.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.233
Oh, no kidding?

03:11.266 --> 03:14.133
Yeah, she just says the most
awful things like...

03:14.166 --> 03:16.233
I brought her to dinner to meet
my parents, right...

03:16.266 --> 03:18.766
and before we started eating my
mum says, "Let's pray".

03:18.800 --> 03:21.033
She goes, "I'm an atheist".

03:21.066 --> 03:23.666
Like she couldn't just
go along with it.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.500
Wow, brutally honest.

03:26.533 --> 03:27.733
Yeah, definitely brutal.

03:27.766 --> 03:30.366
So we bow our heads, close our
eyes, and she just sat there...

03:30.400 --> 03:32.666
staring at us like we're morons.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.600
Well, how‐‐ how'd you know that?

03:34.633 --> 03:35.800
What?

03:35.833 --> 03:37.100
I mean, if your eyes
are closed...

03:37.133 --> 03:38.600
how'd you know what
she was doing?

03:38.633 --> 03:39.766
Oh, I peeped.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.933
Oh.
Yeah.

03:40.966 --> 03:43.366
So anyway, we get through the
prayer, we start eating.

03:43.400 --> 03:47.066
It's dead quiet in the room,
uncomfortable quiet.

03:47.100 --> 03:50.333
And then she goes,
"This chicken's overcooked".

03:50.366 --> 03:52.766
I'd rather her choke on that
chicken, than say that.

03:54.666 --> 03:59.333
My god, that could not have gone
over good with the parentals.

03:59.366 --> 04:01.100
No... well, my dad loves her.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.266
He says she's been over‐cooking
the chicken for 25 years...

04:03.300 --> 04:05.366
and someone's finally called
her out on it.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.066
My mum asks me every day if I've
managed to get rid of her yet.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.133
Ah!

04:10.166 --> 04:14.033
Well, I'm sorry about that,
dude, you know...

04:14.066 --> 04:17.733
but I feel‐‐ I feel lucky,
you know?

04:17.766 --> 04:22.600
It's like, er, Laura is so cool,
you know?

04:22.633 --> 04:25.366
I mean, I‐I think that's true,
that statement...

04:25.400 --> 04:28.466
happy wife, happy life.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.566
Um, yeah.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.166
Huh?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.233
What?

04:36.266 --> 04:37.033
What was that?

04:37.066 --> 04:40.066
What was what?
What you just said.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.500
What'd I just say?

04:41.533 --> 04:43.466
Dude, is everything cool?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.433
Um, yeah.

04:45.466 --> 04:47.666
Okay, now that's twice.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.633
Yeah, I said "yeah" twice.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.633
Is there something you're not
telling me?

04:51.666 --> 04:53.100
No.

04:53.133 --> 04:55.033
Are you sure?

04:55.066 --> 04:56.600
Um, yeah.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.766
Hi, Woody.
Hi.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.533
Heavy play.

05:04.566 --> 05:06.066
Oh, tell me.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.566
I miss 'Cheers'.
Me, too.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.133
You were so young and innocent
back then.

05:11.166 --> 05:14.500
Yeah, be a‐‐ give a lot to be
either one of those things now.

05:14.533 --> 05:16.500
You're all right, Woody. Would
you sign that for me, please?

05:16.533 --> 05:19.066
Dave.
Don't sign for paparazzi, Dave.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.333
Apparently, you do pose
for them, though, mate.

05:22.366 --> 05:25.733
Oh, yeah, lovely, lovely, mate.
Lovely, thank you.

05:25.766 --> 05:27.400
Woody. Woody. Woody.

05:27.433 --> 05:31.300
Oh my god, I knew something
was going on, dude.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.766
Yeah.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.100
When‐‐ when did you see this?

05:35.133 --> 05:36.600
Just this morning.

05:36.633 --> 05:38.300
And you kept it from me all day?

05:38.333 --> 05:39.600
I didn't know you didn't know.

05:39.633 --> 05:42.266
Dude, of course you knew
I didn't know.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.600
What would it have helped to say
something earlier?

05:44.633 --> 05:47.266
Because knowledge is power,
all right?

05:47.300 --> 05:51.033
For one thing, I never would've
had Laura meet me out, okay?

05:51.066 --> 05:53.400
The second she walks out
that door...

05:53.433 --> 05:56.800
the chances of her seeing
it double, quadruple.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.600
Sept... sept‐‐

05:59.633 --> 06:01.066
I'm sorry, Woody.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.566
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.066
Just relax, just relax,
don't get worked up.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.133
Remember your chi,
you taught me that.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.466
It's fine, this is nothing new.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.466
Losing my wife is new, dude.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.633
Yeah. No, no, you're fine,
maybe she hasn't even seen it.

06:17.666 --> 06:20.533
Oh, that's true, I mean,
maybe she hasn't seen it.

06:20.566 --> 06:22.466
Yeah, you'd be able to tell,
as soon as you see her...

06:22.500 --> 06:23.600
if she's seen it or not.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.700
Right.
If she hasn't, get her home.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.300
Right, get her home immediately.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.600
And there's a good chance
she never will see it.

06:28.633 --> 06:30.300
Right, right. Yeah, yeah,
that's true.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.666
Stay positive, life's good.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.400
Right, right, positive,
yeah, life is good.

06:34.433 --> 06:35.533
Life's great.

06:35.566 --> 06:36.733
Right, right, life is great.

06:36.766 --> 06:38.033
It's a good day.

06:38.066 --> 06:40.033
It's a great day, man.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.566
Yeah, you got it, Woods.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.366
Alex, you are such a good buddy,
man.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.666
Hey, will you come in there
with me?

06:46.700 --> 06:48.333
God, no, no, if she has
seen it...

06:48.366 --> 06:49.600
I don't wanna be anywhere
near you, mate.

06:49.633 --> 06:51.266
Good luck, though, yeah.

07:06.433 --> 07:09.333
Good evening, sir.
Thank you.

07:09.366 --> 07:12.400
Hi, hon.
Hi, love.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.100
How you doing?
I'm good.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.300
Yeah?
Yeah.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.500
Everything's groovy?

07:17.533 --> 07:19.400
Why are you acting so strange?

07:19.433 --> 07:22.100
I'm not, I'm not acting str‐‐

07:22.133 --> 07:23.666
Because it's coming and I‐‐

07:23.700 --> 07:26.333
It's cold out there
and my lips‐‐

07:26.366 --> 07:29.266
It's coming off as strange,
but I'm just strangely happy.

07:29.300 --> 07:32.800
Er, did you eat?
Yeah, we ate.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.266
Let's get the check.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's
the rush?

07:35.466 --> 07:37.166
Sit down. Look, I got this
for you. You're not hungry?

07:37.200 --> 07:38.366
Well, let's doggy bag it,
you know‐‐

07:38.400 --> 07:41.266
No, sit down, tell me how
the show was tonight, come on.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.533
It was‐‐ it was good. It was
just, er‐‐

07:43.566 --> 07:46.433
You know, I, I wanna get
you home and, you know...

07:46.466 --> 07:49.100
er, maybe get you, and run you
a hot bath.

07:49.133 --> 07:51.100
And‐‐ and maybe give you
a massage...

07:51.133 --> 07:52.766
and then get you drunk and
take advantage of you.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.100
Really?
Yeah.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.300
Wow, what has gotten into you?

07:57.333 --> 08:01.533
Nothing, I just‐‐ I feel so
lucky to be your husband.

08:01.566 --> 08:04.033
You are lucky.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.600
So am I.

08:05.633 --> 08:09.166
And maybe, if you're
really, really lucky...

08:09.200 --> 08:11.500
I might just let you
take advantage of me.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.500
Um, so where's the rascals?
And you know what?

08:16.533 --> 08:18.133
There's still plenty of wine
left in this bottle.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.333
You want me to pour you
a glass?

08:19.366 --> 08:20.600
Let's just cork it, drink
it in the tub.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.100
Where's the munchkins?

08:22.133 --> 08:24.566
They're around here somewhere.
Here you are, sir.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.100
Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.300
Can we get the wine and the
food to go, please?

08:28.333 --> 08:29.400
Oh, certainly, sir, no problem.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.133
Okay, great.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.566
I'm just kidding.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.700
No, what's the best tip
you ever got?

08:41.732 --> 08:44.333
To buy Apple.

08:44.366 --> 08:46.133
That's funny, you're funny.

08:46.166 --> 08:48.466
Yeah, people have accused
me of that.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.133
Er, so can I get some
candles, maybe?

08:52.166 --> 08:54.700
Whoa, whoa, what has
gotten into you tonight?

08:54.733 --> 08:56.266
Well, you know, for the
tub, you know.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.266
Er, 'Be Prepared', Boy
Scout motto.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.233
Wait, you were a Boy Scout?

09:00.266 --> 09:02.266
Er, Cub, but highly decorated.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.166
Oh, I wish I could have
known you then.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.466
Honey, that's almost weird,
you'd be way too old for me.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.466
I bet you were a hot,
little Cub Scout.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.166
Honey... I think she's having
a Chinese reaction to the wine.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.300
500.
Huh?

09:15.333 --> 09:17.466
The biggest tip I've
ever gotten, 500 pounds.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.500
Holy moly.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.733
Is this 'Natural Born Killer'...

09:20.766 --> 09:22.100
making you an 'Indecent
Proposal'?

09:22.133 --> 09:23.100
Oh...

09:23.133 --> 09:24.666
Hey, you can tell me, 'White
Men Can't Jump'.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.400
Oh, that's, that's good.
Yeah.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.333
500.
Oh, oh, right, right.

09:29.366 --> 09:33.500
Hey, yeah... that's sizeable.
Okay, here you go.

09:33.533 --> 09:35.466
That's a little‐‐ you know what?

09:35.500 --> 09:40.466
I'm not gonna be able to meet
that, er, huge, er, number...

09:40.500 --> 09:43.266
that‐‐ whoever that guy,
Aristotle‐fricking‐Onassis.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.666
Here, this is‐‐ okay, that's
for you.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.066
Very kind, sir.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.633
Ah, to whom much is
given, much is required.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.666
Hello, Laura.
Hi.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.266
Woody, how are you?

09:54.300 --> 09:56.700
Oh, yeah, hey, hey, uh, good,
good. How are you doing?

09:56.733 --> 09:59.566
Excellent, yeah. D'you
remember my name?

09:59.600 --> 10:03.466
Oh, your name, er, let's
see. Don't tell me.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.066
Moo, Moo, Momah, Mohammed...
no, Mu, Musta...

10:07.100 --> 10:09.166
It starts with an 'M', right?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.366
Alan.
Alan, right, sorry, yeah.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.800
Just another handsome Arab
to you, aren't I?

10:12.833 --> 10:15.400
Right, you really are a
handsome Arab.

10:15.433 --> 10:16.733
I'm Iranian.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.645
Oh, it's a pretty language, huh?

10:22.678 --> 10:23.845
Would you like to meet
the prince?

10:23.878 --> 10:27.311
Oh, yeah, I never met a prince
before, other than Prince.

10:27.345 --> 10:28.545
You wanna meet a prince?
Yeah.

10:28.578 --> 10:31.278
Woody, this is Prince Abu Ali
Adullah Bin Saltan Al Rahmanil.

10:31.311 --> 10:34.611
Oh, hey, nice to...
Oh my god!

10:34.645 --> 10:36.978
Hey, careful, there's
gravity there.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.211
Good one.
You okay, Papa?

10:39.245 --> 10:41.478
Er, yeah.

10:41.511 --> 10:43.578
Oh, no, you tied
other people's shoes?

10:43.611 --> 10:45.711
We tied everybody's.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.411
What should we do, Papa?

10:47.445 --> 10:49.378
Oh, er, well, if I raised you
right, you'll go over there...

10:49.411 --> 10:51.211
and apologize to 'em.

10:51.245 --> 10:52.378
Okay.

10:59.245 --> 11:01.145
- What do we do now?
- Run!

11:01.178 --> 11:03.145
That barman needs to cut
these people off.

11:05.645 --> 11:07.478
Hey.

11:07.511 --> 11:08.645
Nice to meet you.

11:08.678 --> 11:10.511
It's a real pleasure to
meet you.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.478
Oh...

11:11.511 --> 11:15.245
You know, you have given
me many, many, many...

11:15.278 --> 11:19.011
many, many, many, many,
many, many...

11:19.045 --> 11:21.578
many hours of entertainment.

11:21.611 --> 11:24.411
So many "manys". This is my
wife, Laura.

11:24.445 --> 11:26.345
Hello.
Oh...

11:28.578 --> 11:30.645
Enchanté.

11:30.678 --> 11:33.645
Wow, you are a real beauty.

11:33.678 --> 11:35.345
Oh, thank you.
Truly.

11:35.378 --> 11:36.478
You're sweet.

11:36.511 --> 11:40.478
No, no, no, no, no, you're
sweet, like sticky honey.

11:40.511 --> 11:42.445
Er... thank you.

11:42.478 --> 11:43.678
Um...

11:43.711 --> 11:47.445
Well, I'm just gonna, er, run to
the little girls' room, Romeo.

11:47.478 --> 11:48.978
Oh, we got‐‐ we got
a bathroom...

11:49.011 --> 11:51.645
back at the‐‐ back at the
hotel, Juliet.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.111
I'll be right back.

11:53.145 --> 11:55.211
Okay, I'll meet you back
here in a trice.

11:55.245 --> 11:57.111
And, I don't even know what
that word means.

11:57.145 --> 11:59.111
Oh.
Ow.

11:59.145 --> 12:01.278
There's more where that
came from.

12:01.311 --> 12:03.578
Wow, you are really
feeling randy tonight, huh?

12:03.611 --> 12:06.111
"Randy", that's a good
word, too, right?

12:06.145 --> 12:07.278
You scallywag.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.278
Oh, um, you rapscallion.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.445
You scamp. Miscreant.

12:11.478 --> 12:13.078
Bitch.

12:14.578 --> 12:16.745
So, er, how do you know
the prince?

12:16.778 --> 12:18.378
Er, he adopted me.

12:18.411 --> 12:20.745
I was a bastard child and
he raised me like a baby fawn.

12:20.778 --> 12:25.278
He is a fawn in my side.
Fawn in my side.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.745
You'd tell me if I smelled
like BO, would you?

12:26.778 --> 12:28.311
Oh my god, babe, of course.

12:28.345 --> 12:29.678
My god, I thought it was me...

12:29.711 --> 12:31.211
and then I hugged that guy
Alan‐‐

12:31.245 --> 12:33.978
In the green velvet jacket?
Yeah, he stinks.

12:34.011 --> 12:36.645
His laugh annoys me as
well, I've gotta be honest.

12:38.078 --> 12:40.978
♪ I'm learning to love myself ♪

12:41.011 --> 12:44.078
♪ Yeah I'm learning
to love myself ♪

12:44.111 --> 12:46.045
♪ I'm learn‐‐ ♪

12:46.078 --> 12:47.711
No, keep going.
My God.

12:47.745 --> 12:51.011
Keep going.
I'm‐‐ I'm so embarrassed.

12:51.045 --> 12:54.578
Cute.
Yeah... oh, no.

12:54.611 --> 12:57.445
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
honestly and just the once...

12:57.478 --> 13:00.578
but d'you feel like my
neck has grown?

13:00.611 --> 13:04.411
Look at me, like out, like
the circumference of it?

13:04.445 --> 13:06.078
Well, that's a 'yes', 'cause
I can see it in your face. What?

13:06.111 --> 13:07.278
Babe, babe, do you know what
you should do?

13:07.311 --> 13:09.345
Do this, but with your neck.
Really? How often?

13:09.378 --> 13:11.611
Just like every morning when
you wake up.

13:11.645 --> 13:13.378
I mean, the fat might displace
to another part of your body...

13:13.411 --> 13:15.078
but I'm sure you'll be fine.

13:15.111 --> 13:18.178
I used to hate my nose,
now it's my neck.

13:18.211 --> 13:20.511
Your nose is fine.
Come in sooner with that.

13:20.545 --> 13:23.545
Babe, your nose is fine,
you're being ridiculous.

13:23.578 --> 13:26.178
Okay. So which one do
you want?

13:26.211 --> 13:28.745
I don't know. I think Sayed
is really sexy.

13:28.778 --> 13:31.011
I'm so glad you said
that because, honestly...

13:31.045 --> 13:32.478
the prince is mine tonight.

13:32.511 --> 13:33.678
If I get rid of this neck
thing...

13:33.711 --> 13:37.478
I'm gonna sit on that
throne. Am I right?

13:37.511 --> 13:38.611
The prince?
Too much?

13:38.645 --> 13:40.611
He's like four times your age.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.245
And that's your judgement face.

13:42.278 --> 13:43.711
Babe, I'm your friend,
I don't judge you.

13:43.745 --> 13:47.311
Yeah, exactly, okay, so
the prince is mine tonight...

13:47.345 --> 13:49.978
and you can have Seaweed.

13:50.011 --> 13:50.978
Seaweed?

13:51.011 --> 13:52.078
Am I saying that wrong?

13:52.111 --> 13:53.978
Babe, his name is Sayed,
it's not that hard to say.

13:54.011 --> 13:55.545
Wait, did you see this?

13:58.011 --> 13:59.545
No, no, no, no.
Grim.

13:59.578 --> 14:02.645
No, look, and the funniest thing
about this is that...

14:02.678 --> 14:05.678
he's actually upstairs right
now with his wife.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.011
You know, the Asian one?

14:07.045 --> 14:08.211
That's his wife?
Yes.

14:08.245 --> 14:10.445
And they're okay with this?
Well, she didn't seem upset...

14:10.478 --> 14:11.545
and they actually seemed
quite happy.

14:11.578 --> 14:14.711
Although, Asians are the
masters of hiding emotion.

14:14.745 --> 14:17.078
So true.
Mmm‐hmm.

14:17.111 --> 14:19.478
Oh, she's so fit, so much fitter
than any of these.

14:19.511 --> 14:22.378
God, so much surgery in
one photograph.

14:22.411 --> 14:23.211
Do I need surgery here?

14:23.245 --> 14:25.278
Babe, just slap it, you'll
be fine.

14:25.311 --> 14:26.311
D'you know what I think?

14:26.345 --> 14:29.445
This is options though, for
you, for tonight.

14:29.478 --> 14:31.445
Come on, they're obviously not
happily married.

14:31.478 --> 14:33.445
If you don't wanna go
for Seaweed, I'd go for him.

14:33.478 --> 14:34.678
I think he's an actor.

14:34.711 --> 14:35.678
I don't do 'married'.

14:35.711 --> 14:37.178
He likes Asians anyway.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.345
Babe, none of these women are
Asian.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.011
Well, not with those boobs, no.

14:42.045 --> 14:43.245
Okay, you good?

14:43.278 --> 14:46.545
Yeah. I'm just checking
I have it. Yeah.

14:46.578 --> 14:49.245
You good?
Fine, let's go.

14:49.278 --> 14:50.245
Yeah.

14:50.278 --> 14:51.478
Oh, teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.

14:51.511 --> 14:53.411
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, check me.
Am I okay?

14:53.445 --> 14:55.011
Okay and me?
Definitely?

14:55.045 --> 14:56.445
Yeah, you're fine.
Are you sure? No Seaweed?

14:56.478 --> 14:58.978
Not yet there isn't.

14:59.011 --> 15:00.511
Can you just check the
bogies for me?

15:00.545 --> 15:01.611
Yeah.
Okay, you're good. Me?

15:01.645 --> 15:03.311
Am I clear?
Clear skies, yeah.

15:03.345 --> 15:04.445
Are you sure?
Yeah.

15:04.478 --> 15:05.711
Wait, is he an actor...

15:05.745 --> 15:07.478
or am I just completely
getting that wrong?

15:07.511 --> 15:09.511
Oh my god, yeah, babe,
he's been in so many films.

15:09.545 --> 15:13.345
I feel like it's TV. Yes.
Oh my god, what's it called?

15:13.378 --> 15:16.478
It's so famous, and it made him.

15:16.511 --> 15:17.578
'Full House'.

15:17.611 --> 15:19.011
D'you know what?
I never saw that.

15:19.045 --> 15:23.345
Woody, I wonder if I can
interest you in, um...

15:23.378 --> 15:26.078
going out with us
for a few drinks?

15:26.111 --> 15:28.211
Uh, no, any other night but,
you know, it's‐‐

15:28.245 --> 15:31.078
It's actually 'date' night
for me and the wifey‐poo.

15:31.111 --> 15:32.478
You know, we're like newly‐weds.

15:32.511 --> 15:33.578
I mean, she's so...
Really?

15:33.611 --> 15:34.678
...ravenous for me.

15:34.711 --> 15:35.645
Wow.

15:35.678 --> 15:37.311
Yeah, I mean, she's like
a jaguar on the hunt.

15:37.345 --> 15:40.178
I can picture her now,
tearing at your flesh.

15:40.211 --> 15:43.545
Yeah.
Whoa, whoa, a jaguar.

15:43.578 --> 15:46.178
Honey?

15:46.211 --> 15:48.011
Were you just hoping I
wouldn't see this?

15:48.045 --> 15:50.211
I am so sorry, honey.

15:50.245 --> 15:53.678
Three women? How, how does
that even happen?

15:53.711 --> 15:58.145
Well, I mean, they‐‐ they came
up to me outside of this bar...

15:58.178 --> 16:01.578
and they‐‐ er, they asked me...

16:01.611 --> 16:05.578
if I wanted to take a walk
on the wild side.

16:05.611 --> 16:07.645
A walk on the wild side?

16:07.678 --> 16:11.511
Honey, I'm so sorry. I
was really, really drunk.

16:11.545 --> 16:13.611
An apology followed by an
excuse is bullshit.

16:13.645 --> 16:15.645
I'm not excusing, I'm
giving context, you know.

16:15.678 --> 16:17.545
Well, you know, maybe I'll get
really, really drunk tonight...

16:17.578 --> 16:20.311
and find myself three
hot, young Englishmen.

16:20.345 --> 16:21.978
Honey, the children might
hear you.

16:22.011 --> 16:22.978
Fuck the children!

16:23.011 --> 16:23.978
Oh!

16:24.011 --> 16:26.211
Excuse me.
No, excuse me.

16:29.445 --> 16:31.278
Are you okay?

16:31.311 --> 16:33.245
No.

16:33.278 --> 16:34.445
The, um...

16:34.478 --> 16:36.611
the, er, prince is, is leaving.

16:36.645 --> 16:38.478
Okay.

16:40.545 --> 16:45.045
Woody... I do hope
everything's okay.

16:45.078 --> 16:46.611
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

16:46.645 --> 16:51.378
Asian women, they are beautiful,
but they are problem.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.511
No, I think I might be
the problem on this here.

16:53.545 --> 16:54.511
No, no, no, no, no.

16:54.545 --> 16:55.678
I can't find the kids.

16:55.711 --> 16:58.145
They're, they're fine, trust me.

16:58.178 --> 16:59.145
Trust you?

16:59.178 --> 17:01.178
Laura, I wonder...

17:01.211 --> 17:04.211
can I steal your husband away
for one drink?

17:04.244 --> 17:07.244
Oh, you wouldn't be stealing.
Take him. Keep him.

17:07.278 --> 17:09.244
No, no, I'm‐‐ I'm coming
with you, honey.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.178
No, you should go with the
prince.

17:10.211 --> 17:11.078
No, no, no, I'm coming with you.

17:11.111 --> 17:13.678
I don't want you.
Excuse us one second.

17:13.711 --> 17:15.611
Take two.

17:15.645 --> 17:18.310
Honey, you have every right
to be angry.

17:18.345 --> 17:24.211
I'm not angry. I am so
disappointed.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.111
Why didn't you tell me?

17:26.145 --> 17:31.478
Because I was just... I, I mean,
I was terrified of losing you.

17:31.511 --> 17:33.478
I don't know if just
being with me...

17:33.511 --> 17:35.478
is ever gonna be enough
for you.

17:35.511 --> 17:38.511
Honey, I promise you, this
will never happen again.

17:38.545 --> 17:40.178
Never.

17:40.211 --> 17:42.511
I don't wanna compel you to do
something...

17:42.545 --> 17:44.478
that you don't want to do.

17:46.611 --> 17:49.645
Why am I not enough for you?

17:49.678 --> 17:51.211
Oh, honey, you are,
you are, honey.

17:51.245 --> 17:52.645
No, no, do not touch me.

17:52.678 --> 17:54.045
Stop apologizing. ry. I‐‐

17:54.078 --> 17:55.411
Okay, okay.

17:55.445 --> 17:58.345
Maybe... maybe we need some
time apart.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.278
No.
Yeah.

17:59.311 --> 18:00.245
No, no, honey.
I'm gonna get the kids...

18:00.278 --> 18:01.411
...and I am gonna go.
No, we don't. No, honey.

18:01.445 --> 18:03.645
Yes. Yes, we do. I am going.
Honey. Honey, no, no, no.

18:03.678 --> 18:05.111
Woody! Get up.
Please, honey.

18:05.145 --> 18:06.245
Honey, don't leave me.
Get up.

18:06.278 --> 18:08.011
Please don't leave me. Please
don't leave me, honey.

18:08.045 --> 18:11.711
Just listen to me. I can't be
near you right now.

18:11.745 --> 18:17.078
I can't. I need some time
to think about this.

18:17.111 --> 18:21.645
Okay, but I wanna come with
you and we can think together.

18:21.678 --> 18:24.378
It's not about what you want.

18:24.411 --> 18:26.378
Is it?
No.

18:26.411 --> 18:28.378
Okay, okay, okay, look, I'll
go have one drink...

18:28.411 --> 18:32.045
with the prince and then I'll
meet you back at the hotel.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.045
One drink? Well, that will
be a first.

18:34.078 --> 18:36.045
No, no, that's, that's a
hundred per cent guaranz.

18:36.078 --> 18:38.045
I'll just, let's see, it's
10:45 now.

18:38.078 --> 18:41.578
I'll have one drink and I'll
meet you, er, at midnight.

18:41.611 --> 18:42.578
Okay? Midnight.

18:42.611 --> 18:44.578
Just get there when you
get there.

18:44.611 --> 18:46.045
Midnight pumpkin,
midnight pumpkin.

18:46.078 --> 18:47.545
What?
Oh, just a mnemonic device.

18:47.578 --> 18:50.478
I just, I'm, I'm glad we're
gonna talk.

18:53.278 --> 18:55.145
Just call the kids.

19:00.545 --> 19:03.445
Can you spot me a couple of LBs?

19:03.478 --> 19:04.978
Why do you need money?

19:05.011 --> 19:06.978
You're going out with
the prince.

19:07.011 --> 19:08.111
Daddy!

19:08.145 --> 19:11.578
Oh, hey, kids.

19:11.611 --> 19:13.578
Alright, I want you to
look after your mom.

19:13.611 --> 19:14.578
Okay?

19:14.611 --> 19:15.578
Can you do that?

19:15.611 --> 19:16.511
And I'll see you later.

19:16.545 --> 19:17.745
I thought you were coming
home with us.

19:17.778 --> 19:18.978
Let's watch a movie.

19:19.011 --> 19:21.478
Well, no, remember you guys
gotta get some rest tonight...

19:21.511 --> 19:24.111
because you're gonna meet
Harry Potter in the morning.

19:24.145 --> 19:25.445
Come home with us, Daddy.

19:25.478 --> 19:26.711
I can't.
You won't!

19:26.745 --> 19:28.278
I will, I'm just having
one drink.

19:28.311 --> 19:30.278
You always say that.
I don't always say that.

19:30.311 --> 19:32.211
Then why can't you have
a drink with us?

19:32.245 --> 19:33.478
With you lightweights?

19:33.511 --> 19:35.311
I mean, they're not gonna let
you in to a pub.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.345
They give hot toddies
to toddlers here.

19:37.378 --> 19:39.011
We can drink orange juice.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.645
Well‐‐
Come on, Daddy, come on.

19:40.678 --> 19:41.645
Okay, okay...

19:41.678 --> 19:44.411
Hey, honey, I... please,
please let me come home.

19:44.445 --> 19:46.545
You know what? Here.

19:51.445 --> 19:53.746
Don't spend it all on one whore.

19:59.406 --> 20:03.006
Hey.
Honey, Deni? You have‐‐

20:03.039 --> 20:05.172
Here, Daddy, take this magic
feather.

20:05.206 --> 20:06.539
Oh, is that a magic feather?

20:06.572 --> 20:08.039
It came from a magic owl.

20:08.072 --> 20:09.239
Oh, really?

20:09.272 --> 20:10.339
Yes.

20:10.372 --> 20:12.239
With this feather you can
talk directly to God...

20:12.272 --> 20:14.106
and He'll grant you one wish.

20:14.139 --> 20:16.306
Oh, can He make your mom love
me again?

20:16.339 --> 20:18.439
You can't make everyone happy,
Daddy.

20:18.472 --> 20:20.439
You aren't a box of puppies.

20:20.472 --> 20:23.472
Huh, yeah, okay.

20:23.506 --> 20:25.272
Well, thanks for the
feather, kid.

20:25.306 --> 20:27.972
Don't stress or you'll lose
your kid juice, Daddy.

20:28.006 --> 20:29.672
That is good advice.

20:29.706 --> 20:30.972
Very good advice.

20:31.006 --> 20:31.972
I love you.

20:32.006 --> 20:33.072
One wish, Daddy.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.439
Woody, are you ready?

20:34.472 --> 20:37.239
I love you, honey.

20:39.039 --> 20:42.006
Okay. Come.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.439
Let's go.

20:52.172 --> 20:55.506
Hey, hippie, gypsy mobile,
Scooby Doo‐style.

20:55.539 --> 20:57.272
Er, I didn't think it was
your best move...

20:57.306 --> 21:00.106
to pop into a limo full of
scantily clad ladies right now.

21:00.139 --> 21:01.972
Right.

21:04.572 --> 21:06.939
Is everything okay, Mommy?

21:06.972 --> 21:09.106
No.

21:29.072 --> 21:30.139
Tight squeeze or what.

21:35.272 --> 21:36.939
I'm Sayed.

21:36.972 --> 21:38.139
Oh, hey, Woody.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.706
Omar.
Hello.

21:39.739 --> 21:43.406
Love Annie Hall.
You‐‐ you all right?

21:43.439 --> 21:46.039
Er, I'm a little glum.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.539
Glum? Why are you glum?

21:47.572 --> 21:51.439
Er, just me and the wifey
have, we're just...

21:51.472 --> 21:53.372
we're in a little rut,
you know.

21:53.406 --> 21:55.239
You been with her a while?

21:55.272 --> 21:57.506
Yeah, since '87.

21:57.539 --> 21:59.506
She's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

21:59.539 --> 22:00.472
You know, I think being born...

22:00.506 --> 22:02.506
was the best thing to
ever happen to you.

22:02.539 --> 22:04.506
No, honestly, I wouldn't have
wanted to have been born...

22:04.539 --> 22:05.339
if I hadn't met her.

22:05.372 --> 22:08.272
I mean, she's made my
life great.

22:08.306 --> 22:10.272
This is‐‐ this is over
the magazine?

22:10.306 --> 22:12.206
Yeah. I wonder if anybody
didn't see this?

22:12.239 --> 22:14.272
No, everyone saw it.

22:14.306 --> 22:15.372
Yeah, it's on every newsstand.

22:15.406 --> 22:17.272
And even the people that
don't buy it, you know...

22:17.306 --> 22:19.272
they see the picture,
the headline.

22:19.306 --> 22:21.272
It's a good picture,
it's proper, sexy.

22:21.306 --> 22:23.272
Oh, thanks.
Not you, the birds.

22:23.306 --> 22:25.239
Why do you buy that filth?

22:25.272 --> 22:26.672
'Cause you're on the bloody
front cover.

22:26.706 --> 22:28.206
You're never on the front
cover of anything.

22:28.239 --> 22:30.339
You think I wouldn't drop
40 pence for you?

22:30.372 --> 22:32.106
Let's go on, boys.

22:34.306 --> 22:35.339
What are you doing?

22:35.372 --> 22:37.506
It's a hippie gypsy party.

22:37.539 --> 22:39.106
Did you really shag
three birds at once?

22:39.139 --> 22:40.639
Bruv, that is more fun than
I ever had.

22:40.672 --> 22:41.706
Well of course, you just
got your own two paws...

22:41.739 --> 22:43.572
to maul at your man clam.
Oh, shut up. Shut up.

22:43.606 --> 22:46.706
He's got six helping hands.
Alright, we'll see tonight then.

22:46.739 --> 22:48.472
Yeah, that's it...

22:48.506 --> 22:52.672
Hey, hey, shut up.
Hey! Shut up!

22:52.706 --> 22:55.339
Can't you see what the man
is going through?

22:55.372 --> 22:56.272
Sorry.

22:56.306 --> 22:58.606
You have very expressive
bodyguards.

22:58.639 --> 23:02.472
Bodyguards? If a bullet were
to come...

23:02.506 --> 23:04.039
they would shove me in
front, you know.

23:04.072 --> 23:05.306
They're his sons, you daft
wanker.

23:05.339 --> 23:07.706
Hey, hey, hey.
Oh.

23:07.739 --> 23:11.372
Woody, I'm sorry for what
you're going through.

23:11.406 --> 23:14.672
Yeah, man, this has rocked me
to my core, I gotta say.

23:14.706 --> 23:17.572
You know, I used to be
very religious and...

23:17.606 --> 23:21.606
I don't know, I guess I got
kind of side‐tracked.

23:21.639 --> 23:24.239
But, you know, I, I feel like...

23:24.272 --> 23:27.206
I need to get more
spiritual, you know.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.072
Like more meditation and yoga.

23:29.106 --> 23:31.939
And all, all signs are
pointing the same direction.

23:31.972 --> 23:33.572
Soul.

23:33.606 --> 23:35.139
So listen to more Marvin
Gaye, then.

23:35.172 --> 23:36.306
Ah, I see what you did there.

23:36.339 --> 23:38.939
You've gotta laugh to keep
yourself from crying sometimes.

23:38.972 --> 23:41.572
Smile though your heart
is breaking.

23:41.606 --> 23:44.206
Yeah, force a smile, pop a
pill, eat a pizza.

23:44.239 --> 23:45.939
Anything but feel it, right?

23:45.972 --> 23:47.972
You need a drink?
Big time.

23:48.006 --> 23:50.506
Well, I got just the thing
for you, baby girl.

23:50.539 --> 23:53.072
I know exactly what
you're going through.

23:53.106 --> 23:56.639
Their mother gives me no
end of torment.

23:56.672 --> 23:58.372
Always moody.

23:58.406 --> 24:00.706
I want to blow my brains
over her shoe closet.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.706
Yeah, all right, Pops, wouldn't
that make her moodier?

24:02.739 --> 24:04.506
She loves her shoes.

24:04.539 --> 24:08.072
Fortunately, my other
wives are more cheerful.

24:08.106 --> 24:11.339
More, er, youthful.
Yeah, d'you want one?

24:11.372 --> 24:12.606
Sort you out nicely.
Yeah?

24:12.639 --> 24:14.339
We got a spare one, actually.

24:14.372 --> 24:16.272
It's, er, Miss Skegness 1995.

24:16.306 --> 24:21.006
Hold on, boobs or bum? Bruv.
D'you like boobs or bum?

24:21.039 --> 24:21.939
Skegness.

24:21.972 --> 24:24.006
He's got one from
Uzbekistan. Pakistan.

24:24.039 --> 24:25.139
Kazak... all the 'stans'.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.272
Variety is the, the, the
spice of life.

24:27.306 --> 24:28.272
Equal opportunities.

24:28.306 --> 24:30.272
Equal opportunity, yes.
I like it.

24:30.306 --> 24:32.406
Ooh, ooh, you have reached
your destination.

24:32.439 --> 24:33.939
Please mind the gap.

24:33.972 --> 24:38.906
Okay, boys, behave yourselves.

24:47.706 --> 24:49.672
Okay?
Always, Pops.

24:49.706 --> 24:51.672
I hope I fall into a bowl
of pussy soup tonight, boy.

24:51.706 --> 24:52.506
Give me a second, eh.

24:52.539 --> 24:55.606
Let me, er, go wave my magic
wand.

24:55.639 --> 24:56.806
So where is your wife?

24:56.839 --> 25:00.472
Oh, she's, er, she's probably
heading back to the hotel.

25:00.506 --> 25:01.272
Oh.

25:01.306 --> 25:03.472
Oh, she'll be fine.
Yeah, yeah.

25:03.506 --> 25:07.372
I mean, I'm gonna meet
up with her later.

25:07.406 --> 25:08.539
Yeah, that's later.

25:08.572 --> 25:11.272
For now, you come with us
and have a few drinks, okay?

25:11.306 --> 25:13.439
Well I told her I'd have
one drink.

25:13.472 --> 25:15.672
One drink, that's all
I'm having.

25:15.706 --> 25:19.106
So we have a drink,
dance, laugh.

25:19.139 --> 25:22.506
Later, you go home, everything
will be okay.

25:22.539 --> 25:23.972
You think so?

25:24.006 --> 25:25.239
I know so.

25:25.272 --> 25:27.039
I like your confidence.

25:27.072 --> 25:31.372
What did you do wrong, eh?
Are you a man?

25:31.406 --> 25:33.539
Well, yeah, I mean, yeah.

25:33.572 --> 25:36.272
Every man deserves at
least three wives.

25:36.306 --> 25:39.139
Well, okay, I mean, I'll talk
to the missus, but‐‐

25:39.172 --> 25:40.539
Yeah, that's all good and all
that but what are we gonna do...

25:40.572 --> 25:42.272
about this God awful line?

25:42.306 --> 25:44.006
I wouldn't worry about that.

25:44.039 --> 25:45.006
Oh, yeah, why is that?

25:45.039 --> 25:46.239
TV‐Q.

25:46.272 --> 25:47.406
TV‐Q, what's that?

25:47.439 --> 25:48.539
Television quotient.

25:48.572 --> 25:50.672
You know, it's just a read
of how popular you are...

25:50.706 --> 25:55.306
in a given culture and
luckily my, my, er, TV‐Q...

25:55.339 --> 25:57.206
is pretty strong
in the Mother Country.

25:57.239 --> 25:58.672
- Yeah. Right.
- Green light. Let's go.

25:58.706 --> 26:00.372
Oh, yeah. See?

26:01.051 --> 26:04.884
And it's, Hollywood is almost
like royalty without borders.

26:04.917 --> 26:06.584
I, I hope that doesn't
sound arrogant.

26:06.617 --> 26:07.851
Don't sound humble.

26:07.884 --> 26:09.051
Well...

26:09.084 --> 26:11.917
Hey, by the way, I was wanting
to ask you, what country‐‐

26:11.951 --> 26:15.151
Prince Abu Ali Adullah
Bin Saltan Al Rahmani.

26:15.184 --> 26:16.651
That's very impressive, though.

26:16.684 --> 26:17.784
Wait, just tell 'em
I'm with you.

26:17.817 --> 26:19.317
Use your TVQ.
Hey.

26:19.351 --> 26:21.817
Spare change?

26:21.851 --> 26:23.984
Er, no. I don't have it.
Dude, dude, er...

26:24.017 --> 26:25.751
What?
I'm with him.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.717
With who?
With‐‐ with him, the prince.

26:28.751 --> 26:30.884
Which prince?

26:30.917 --> 26:34.584
The one‐‐ the one who just
went in. How many you got?

26:38.051 --> 26:39.351
Five.

26:39.384 --> 26:41.651
Yeah, the one who just went
in, okay?

26:41.684 --> 26:43.151
Well, you need to get back
down that road there.

26:43.184 --> 26:44.884
Yeah, get to the back, yeah?
Dude, I just came with him...

26:44.917 --> 26:47.951
in that van, right there.

26:47.984 --> 26:50.784
The prince, the prince came
in that, in that van there?

26:50.817 --> 26:51.917
Yeah.

26:55.184 --> 26:57.317
What is the prince's name?

26:57.351 --> 27:03.117
Er... Moham... Mustaf...
Moosh... er, His, His Highness.

27:03.151 --> 27:05.151
Right?

27:06.684 --> 27:08.784
You're not getting in here.

27:09.884 --> 27:12.651
Can I speak plainly?

27:12.684 --> 27:14.617
Why are you whispering?

27:14.651 --> 27:16.051
Er, I‐‐ I'm an actor.

27:16.084 --> 27:18.684
I thought actors were handsome.
I was.

27:18.717 --> 27:21.584
What have I seen you in?
Um, 'White Men Can't Jump'.

27:21.617 --> 27:24.184
What, from the '70s?
'90s.

27:24.217 --> 27:26.117
Er, 'Indecent Proposal'?

27:26.151 --> 27:27.951
Tear‐jerker?
Yeah. You saw it?

27:27.984 --> 27:30.217
No, but my grandmother loved it.

27:30.251 --> 27:31.917
Oh, well, tell her 'hi' from me.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.851
She's long dead.

27:33.884 --> 27:35.884
Not unlike your career.

27:39.117 --> 27:41.651
Anything else in this century?

27:41.684 --> 27:44.717
Um, okay, I'm in a play
on the West End.

27:44.751 --> 27:46.651
You‐‐ you like drama?
What, pay to be depressed?

27:46.684 --> 27:48.184
Come on, mate, get to the
back of the line.

27:48.217 --> 27:50.584
Oh, just go to The Edge,
alright? Go away from here.

That's what happens when

Yeah, no sense.
Sad, knob jockey.

28:23.917 --> 28:26.217
Hi.
Hi.

28:31.084 --> 28:34.151
Woody Allen?
Yeah.

28:34.184 --> 28:37.684
Hi, I'm Zrinka.
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

28:37.717 --> 28:38.717
Hi, hi.

28:38.751 --> 28:42.084
You don't look like
you're having a good time.

28:42.117 --> 28:45.151
Yeah, well my friends just
went in without me.

28:45.184 --> 28:47.851
Well, some friends are not
very nice.

28:47.884 --> 28:49.151
Do you have the time?

28:49.184 --> 28:51.017
Um, I think it's almost 11:00.

28:51.051 --> 28:52.251
Yeah.

28:52.284 --> 28:56.017
I mean I don't even wanna go in.
I just, I gotta kill an hour.

28:56.051 --> 28:59.051
Whoa, kill an hour?

28:59.084 --> 29:01.984
Can we kill time?

29:03.617 --> 29:04.951
Yeah.

29:07.117 --> 29:09.651
Why are you holding your
breath, Woody?

29:09.684 --> 29:12.984
Oh, yeah, I‐‐ God, I do that.
I do that when I get stressed.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.584
I just‐‐
Well, don't.

29:14.617 --> 29:17.117
Yeah, right.
Just‐‐ just breathe.

29:17.151 --> 29:19.151
All doors will open.

29:20.751 --> 29:22.351
Yeah. Good.

29:22.384 --> 29:24.851
Woody! Woody, my friend.

29:24.884 --> 29:26.751
Come, come, come, your prince
is looking for you.

29:26.784 --> 29:27.917
See?
Really?

29:27.951 --> 29:30.717
Yes, yes, come. Now fine boy,
eh?

29:30.751 --> 29:32.917
Okay, the prince wants me, okay.

29:32.951 --> 29:34.917
Yes, yes, the prince that
came in that crappy‐‐

29:34.951 --> 29:38.217
Look at the car you came inside
now, eh? Ah, funky, funky.

29:38.251 --> 29:39.684
Bye.
All right, come on, come on.

29:39.717 --> 29:42.151
No, no, just, just you.
Just you, just you.

29:42.184 --> 29:46.017
Oh, oh, okay, well, er, tell
the prince that I just will...

29:46.051 --> 29:49.117
er, wait out here until
my friend's admitted.

29:49.151 --> 29:51.351
Well, you just met her now.

29:51.384 --> 29:54.751
Yeah, but I find that friends
are easily identifiable...

29:54.784 --> 29:56.917
as are enemies.

29:56.951 --> 30:01.617
See, okay, see I'm not, I don't
want to hassle anybody, eh?

30:01.651 --> 30:03.284
Okay, okay, okay, come, come,
eh, come inside, come inside.

30:03.317 --> 30:05.851
Yeah? Okay.
We're friends now?

30:05.884 --> 30:08.951
Yes, now of course we are
friends. This my number, eh.

30:08.984 --> 30:10.651
Oh, okay.
Any time you want to come...

30:10.684 --> 30:11.684
Hmm.
I'll put you on the list.

30:11.717 --> 30:15.751
Just call me. V‐V‐I‐P,
very, very important person.

30:15.784 --> 30:16.917
Okay.

30:16.951 --> 30:17.984
Also, er, if you want to come
to my mother's house...

30:18.017 --> 30:22.751
she makes the best
authentic Nigerian lamb stew.

30:22.784 --> 30:25.784
Sweet meat.
Okay, well, I'm a vegetarian.

30:25.817 --> 30:28.851
Why, man? Why?

30:30.351 --> 30:32.717
Wait. My card is there so just,
it's there.

30:32.751 --> 30:35.717
Okay. I got it, so, thank you,
no, no, I got your‐‐ I got‐‐

30:35.751 --> 30:38.151
I'm gonna call you and
then you'll have my digis.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.751
Yes, Woody‐Woody.
Thanks, guys.

30:39.784 --> 30:40.917
- Yeah, yeah.
- Five boy.

30:40.951 --> 30:42.651
Oh, that's, that's great.

30:45.151 --> 30:48.017
Okay. Butthole.

30:48.051 --> 30:50.851
Whoa... is this your best self?

30:50.884 --> 30:53.217
I'm not sure I own a best self.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.117
Well you need to love
yourself...

30:55.151 --> 30:57.217
before you can be your best
self.

30:57.251 --> 31:00.584
Well, that's exactly why I
drink. Can I get you something?

31:00.617 --> 31:02.617
No, no, no, I'll get
you something.

31:02.651 --> 31:04.317
Well, no, no, it's on me,
I insist.

31:04.351 --> 31:07.284
Okay. Thank you.

31:07.317 --> 31:09.017
Do you wanna know what I want?

31:09.051 --> 31:11.351
I know what you need.

32:00.384 --> 32:03.684
Hey, TV‐Q, you made it!
Oh, hey.

32:03.717 --> 32:04.884
I'm just messing with you,
you know that, mate.

32:04.917 --> 32:06.117
Yeah, thanks for your help
on that.

32:06.151 --> 32:09.617
It's all good.
Wassup!

32:09.651 --> 32:10.817
You want a shot of Patrón?

32:10.851 --> 32:13.251
Come on, let's get off our tits
and dance like Tina Turner.

32:13.284 --> 32:16.317
Okay.
Right, look at me. Look at me.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.051
I love you, baby girl,
and you love me.

32:18.084 --> 32:19.151
Right.

32:19.184 --> 32:20.251
And never would I steer
you wrong.

32:20.284 --> 32:22.984
I love you all to the maximus.

32:23.017 --> 32:25.317
Oh, bring it in, come on,
yes, that's it.

32:25.351 --> 32:27.684
Got a lot of love.

32:27.717 --> 32:30.117
Guys, shots all round, yeah?

32:32.984 --> 32:34.684
Hey, Woody, are you okay?

32:34.717 --> 32:37.684
Er, it's just the wifey and
I are having a little issue.

32:37.717 --> 32:41.117
Yeah, I read the news today.
Oh, boy.

32:41.151 --> 32:42.984
I guess these things just
happen, though.

32:43.017 --> 32:44.717
Here.
Oh, thanks, babe.

32:44.751 --> 32:46.984
You know, weirdly, a
similar thing happened...

32:47.017 --> 32:48.284
to me and my boyfriend.

32:48.317 --> 32:50.884
Oh, really? Well, what'd you do?

32:50.917 --> 32:53.851
Well, I left him. Shot?

32:53.884 --> 32:54.884
Come.

32:56.217 --> 32:58.084
Thank you.

32:58.117 --> 33:01.284
Right, here's to friends...

33:01.317 --> 33:06.351
through thick and thin, Peter
out or Peter in.

33:06.384 --> 33:10.951
Eh, eh, eh, eh, and here
is to Woody, a real man.

33:10.984 --> 33:12.917
A real man!

33:18.217 --> 33:19.784
I don't like it!

33:35.884 --> 33:37.684
Where you going?
Go to the side, mate.

33:37.717 --> 33:40.051
Yeah.

33:40.084 --> 33:42.784
That's it, reel 'em in,
reel 'em in.

34:33.884 --> 34:36.150
Dude.

34:36.184 --> 34:37.851
Dude.
Dude.

34:37.884 --> 34:40.684
Dude, what are you doing
here, man?

34:40.717 --> 34:42.917
I just came in for a
meeting, but dude...

34:42.951 --> 34:44.684
Ah, just who I needed to
see right now.

34:44.717 --> 34:46.884
What happened?
Oh, you see it?

34:46.917 --> 34:49.650
Yeah, I don't understand
how it came out.

34:49.684 --> 34:50.451
Oh, I don't know.

34:50.484 --> 34:52.650
I mean these things do come
out.

34:52.684 --> 34:55.650
I know, but didn't you talk to
Marty? Everybody talks to Marty.

34:55.684 --> 34:57.184
Yeah, I did, I‐‐ I talked
to Marty, of course.

34:57.217 --> 34:59.684
Right?
Yeah, and he wanted 30K.

34:59.717 --> 35:01.017
Okay.

35:01.051 --> 35:02.851
I mean, that's highway
robbery, dude.

35:02.884 --> 35:05.884
Wait a second, Woody,
you didn't pay?

35:05.917 --> 35:07.651
No, I, I, I tried to negotiate.

35:07.684 --> 35:10.084
No, you can't negotiate
with Marty.

35:10.117 --> 35:12.684
Well he, he's a lawyer,
lawyers do negotiate.

35:12.717 --> 35:15.151
No, no, you, you wanna know who
tried to negotiate?

35:15.184 --> 35:17.717
Peewee and Tiger...
you wanna know who didn't?

35:17.751 --> 35:20.651
Clooney, with Lady Gaga and the
midgets, the little people.

35:20.684 --> 35:23.017
I never heard about that.
Because they didn't negotiate.

35:23.051 --> 35:25.651
I mean, d'you ever hear
about Daniel Day Lewis?

35:25.684 --> 35:26.951
No.
Exactly.

35:26.984 --> 35:29.884
And you never will,
because he paid.

35:29.917 --> 35:32.984
Come on, how can you think you
can get away without paying?

35:33.017 --> 35:35.051
I mean, you know from
McConaughey, if something...

35:35.084 --> 35:36.717
terrible's coming out.
What?

35:36.751 --> 35:38.051
You know from your buddy
McConaughey...

35:38.084 --> 35:39.317
if something terrible's
gonna come out‐‐

35:39.351 --> 35:41.651
No, dude, wait, wait, I don't
know about McConaughey. What?

35:41.684 --> 35:44.617
You don't know about that?
No, no, what happened?

35:44.651 --> 35:46.251
I don't wanna be the one
to tell you.

35:46.284 --> 35:47.951
Oh, dude, just, just tell me.

35:47.984 --> 35:50.184
They got a picture.
Oh, no.

35:50.217 --> 35:51.284
Yeah.
What?

35:51.317 --> 35:53.017
Fat.
Fat?

35:53.051 --> 35:54.717
Fat.

35:54.751 --> 35:57.717
Dude, he, he's got the
best torso in the business.

35:57.751 --> 35:59.951
El Gordo. Buddha.

35:59.984 --> 36:02.751
That's why he paid, so
you never saw it.

36:02.784 --> 36:05.617
I'm amazed.
Come on, let's get a drink.

36:05.651 --> 36:07.317
Dude, why didn't I pay, man?

36:07.351 --> 36:09.117
Can we get a drink here?

36:12.817 --> 36:14.217
Does Laura know?

36:14.251 --> 36:15.617
Er, yeah, yeah.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.784
You know, we're gonna talk,
er, tonight.

36:17.817 --> 36:21.617
Oh... what are you gonna say?

36:21.651 --> 36:23.984
I don't know.
Yeah, what am I gonna say?

36:24.017 --> 36:25.984
What?
To people.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.984
I mean, it's well known I'm
your best friend.

36:28.017 --> 36:29.984
This doesn't look good for
me either.

36:30.017 --> 36:32.717
And I guarantee my mom's
gonna grill me about this.

36:32.751 --> 36:35.117
I'm gonna be like "I don't
know what Woody's problem is".

36:35.151 --> 36:37.884
It's like, I mean obviously it's
not about me right now, but...

36:39.317 --> 36:42.184
What was Laura's reaction
when you told her?

36:42.217 --> 36:44.017
Um...
How did‐‐

36:44.051 --> 36:47.684
I‐‐ I...
You let it blindside her?

36:47.717 --> 36:50.684
Dude, you know what? I‐‐ I hate
Murdoch, man, I hate tabloids.

36:50.717 --> 36:52.684
He's a cancer.
Hey, wait a second.

36:52.717 --> 36:55.684
No, no, Woody, it's not
Murdoch. Come on, it's you.

36:55.717 --> 36:58.351
I think we gotta start with
accepting some responsibility.

36:58.384 --> 37:02.684
Yeah, I... I mean I was weak,
I guess, you know, and...

37:02.717 --> 37:05.051
Yeah, and a little bit
of a coward.

37:05.084 --> 37:06.051
What?

37:06.084 --> 37:07.351
Coward for not telling her.

37:07.384 --> 37:08.417
Yeah.

37:08.451 --> 37:10.351
Look, I don't wanna judge
you for what you did.

37:10.384 --> 37:12.351
Clearly it was wrong,
but the thing is...

37:12.384 --> 37:14.351
But that feels like a
judgement, O.

37:14.384 --> 37:15.184
No, no, no, that's a fact.

37:15.217 --> 37:17.351
And right now we gotta face
facts.

37:17.384 --> 37:20.084
Fact: you cheated on Laura
with a bunch of hookers.

37:20.117 --> 37:22.784
They weren't hookers.
Fact: you let it blindside her.

37:22.817 --> 37:23.984
Well, yeah.

37:24.017 --> 37:27.017
Fact: you gotta brace yourself
for maybe a big element...

37:27.051 --> 37:30.017
of the public that's just gonna
think you're a scumbag.

37:30.051 --> 37:32.017
Obviously not me, I'm your
friend.

37:32.051 --> 37:34.217
I'm gonna support you, but‐‐
Thanks, buddy.

37:34.251 --> 37:36.851
How do you support a scumbag?
That's our challenge.

37:36.884 --> 37:38.851
Owen Wilson.
Yeah.

37:38.884 --> 37:40.317
Hi, I knew it was you, dude.
I love you.

37:40.351 --> 37:41.484
I must have seen 'You, Me and
Dupree and Zoolander'...

37:41.517 --> 37:44.117
like 50 times, like everything
you do, you are the man.

37:44.151 --> 37:46.284
I gotta admit, my ears do prick
up with a little praise...

37:46.317 --> 37:48.584
but I got a man
overboard right now.

37:48.617 --> 37:51.717
So let me just shake your
hand and ask you to step off.

37:51.751 --> 37:53.251
Thank you, 'cause we're in
crisis mode.

37:53.284 --> 37:54.684
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

37:54.717 --> 37:57.017
Okay, where were we?
I'm a scumbag?

37:57.051 --> 37:58.817
Yeah, and what are we gonna
do about it?

37:58.851 --> 38:00.917
Because we gotta do something...

38:00.951 --> 38:03.651
because I can't imagine
you without Laura.

38:03.684 --> 38:05.684
I can imag‐‐ and I'm not saying
this to be mean...

38:05.717 --> 38:07.651
I can imagine Laura
without you...

38:07.684 --> 38:10.651
but you without Laura
does not work.

38:10.684 --> 38:11.617
Well, that's true, man,
I mean‐‐

38:11.651 --> 38:14.351
Right? I mean it's like,
it's just really sad.

38:14.384 --> 38:16.917
Yeah, I mean it's like a, like
a mangy dog...

38:16.951 --> 38:18.584
that no one wants to pat or...

38:18.617 --> 38:19.951
'Cause it smells bad and
you're just like...

38:19.984 --> 38:21.351
"Get this dog out of here".

38:21.384 --> 38:23.017
Yeah, it's like blind in
one eye...

38:23.051 --> 38:25.117
wandering down the road at
night. It's just...

38:25.151 --> 38:27.317
And you know he's never
gonna make it to daybreak...

38:27.351 --> 38:29.851
'cause he's gonna get run over
by a cab or something.

38:29.884 --> 38:32.617
Dude, dude, I can't‐‐
I can't lose her, man.

38:32.651 --> 38:34.217
And, hey...
I cannot lose her.

38:34.251 --> 38:36.684
Whoa, whoa, you're not, hey,
we can figure this out.

38:36.717 --> 38:37.917
Look at me.
Really?

38:37.951 --> 38:40.951
Yes, okay? Where there's a will
there's a way, all right?

38:40.984 --> 38:41.984
But we gotta change your
energy...

38:42.017 --> 38:44.584
because I feel like I'm talking
to a dead man.

38:44.617 --> 38:46.884
It's like you got ghost eyes
right now. Come on, hydrate.

38:46.917 --> 38:48.117
Dude, I feel...
Drink this.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.884
Okay, okay, what is it?
Just down it.

38:49.917 --> 38:52.351
It's a Cosmopolitan,
it's a man's drink, come on.

38:52.384 --> 38:56.651
You gotta get like, loosen up
a little bit.

38:56.684 --> 38:59.017
Okay, come on, roll the
shoulders. Let's start moving.

38:59.051 --> 39:00.151
How do you‐‐

39:00.184 --> 39:01.084
Get the blood flowing.
Okay, yeah.

39:01.117 --> 39:02.051
Okay, it feels better to
start moving, right?

39:02.084 --> 39:03.184
You're right, yeah,
I haven't been exercising.

39:03.217 --> 39:05.351
Okay, let's figure this out.
Come on, throw some punches.

39:05.384 --> 39:06.917
Okay.
Change your energy a little bit.

39:06.951 --> 39:08.151
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:08.184 --> 39:10.251
Okay, now I've known you and
Laura for a long time, right?

39:10.284 --> 39:11.484
Yeah.

39:11.517 --> 39:14.184
Okay, now the one beautiful
thing that I've always seen...

39:14.217 --> 39:16.584
between the two of you is...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

39:16.617 --> 39:18.017
No fighting.

39:18.051 --> 39:20.251
No, no, no, we're not fighting,
we're...

39:20.284 --> 39:22.817
We're actually saving a
man's life right here.

39:22.851 --> 39:25.217
Yeah, it's cool, it's cool.
It's okay.

39:25.251 --> 39:29.017
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:29.051 --> 39:30.317
Okay.

39:30.351 --> 39:32.017
So what, what is it
I say to Laura?

39:32.051 --> 39:34.717
It's not what you say, I think
it's what you do, but...

39:34.751 --> 39:37.317
get your energy up, come on.
Okay, okay, I'm like...

39:37.351 --> 39:39.051
Come on, it's like a zombie.
Right.

39:39.084 --> 39:42.357
Loosen up, do your Elvis.
You're good at your Elvis.

39:47.451 --> 39:49.418
Okay.
Give me a smile.

39:49.451 --> 39:51.418
Let me see a little twinkle.
Give me a smile.

39:51.451 --> 39:53.418
Come on, a real one...
both rows of teeth.

39:53.451 --> 39:55.418
There you go, keep punching,
keep punching.

39:55.451 --> 39:57.418
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, you ready?

39:57.451 --> 39:58.418
Yeah, I'm ready, man.

39:58.451 --> 40:00.418
Okay, I'm gonna sprinkle you
with some gold dust.

40:00.451 --> 40:02.418
Oh, that's what I want.
I'm gonna lay it on you.

40:02.451 --> 40:04.318
Come on, buddy, what do I do?

40:04.351 --> 40:05.284
Pray.

40:05.318 --> 40:08.318
Oh, dude, pray? Dude, are you
kidding me?

40:08.351 --> 40:10.318
Jesus, I mean, that's
just begging in disguise.

40:10.351 --> 40:12.318
What, have you been tap
dancing this whole time?

40:12.351 --> 40:13.418
No, no, no‐‐ that,
that's step one.

40:13.451 --> 40:15.184
You didn't let me get
to step two.

40:15.218 --> 40:19.718
Obviously, prayer without
action is meaningless. Okay?

40:19.751 --> 40:21.851
Now's the action part.
Okay.

40:21.884 --> 40:24.251
Sometimes we gotta admit we need
something, we gotta be able...

40:24.284 --> 40:27.018
to lean on something
stronger than us, right?

40:27.051 --> 40:28.284
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:28.318 --> 40:32.018
So maybe you're not the best
person to carry this message...

40:32.051 --> 40:33.818
of contrition to Laura.

40:33.851 --> 40:35.184
Okay, right, right.
Okay, so...

40:35.218 --> 40:36.751
You see where I'm going?
Where are you from?

40:36.784 --> 40:37.884
Er, Texas.

40:37.918 --> 40:39.818
Where am I from?
Texas.

40:39.851 --> 40:41.818
And who's the Texas Dalai Lama.

40:41.851 --> 40:43.751
Eli Cash?
Come on, you know this.

40:43.784 --> 40:45.284
Hi.
Hi.

40:45.318 --> 40:46.784
Yeah, hi.

40:48.818 --> 40:50.218
This is Owen.
No, no, she's talking...

40:50.251 --> 40:52.118
about my character...
She's, she's saying Eli.

40:52.151 --> 40:53.351
from 'The Royal Tenenbaums'.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.051
I love that scene.

40:55.084 --> 40:56.918
Which scene?
Well, every scene...

40:56.951 --> 40:59.984
but what is the book that your‐‐
your character writes about?

41:00.018 --> 41:01.118
Is it Geronimo?

41:01.151 --> 41:02.218
Hey, guys.
No, no, Custer.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.418
Old Custer, remember?

41:03.451 --> 41:04.551
Of course, 'cause...

41:04.584 --> 41:07.084
everybody knows that Custer
died at Little Big Horn.

41:07.118 --> 41:10.384
What this book presupposes
is "Maybe he didn't!".

41:10.418 --> 41:13.284
I love that, honestly, it's...
That's a good scene, yeah.

41:13.318 --> 41:15.218
one of my favorite moments, in
one of my favorite films ever.

41:15.251 --> 41:16.218
Yeah, thank you.

41:16.251 --> 41:18.318
But I also love 'Did You
Just Call Me Coltrane?'.

41:18.351 --> 41:20.251
Uh, no, but if I did, you...

41:20.284 --> 41:21.651
O...
..couldn't do anything about it.

41:21.684 --> 41:23.118
You don't think so?
O, Owen.

41:23.151 --> 41:25.251
Oh, no, I don't. Oh, you
wanna talk some jive?

41:25.284 --> 41:26.884
Oh, I'll talk some jive
like you've never...

41:26.918 --> 41:28.784
Owen, Owen, can we get back to
me for a second, dude?!

41:28.818 --> 41:31.818
Sit down! I said sit down!
Hey, whoa.

41:31.851 --> 41:34.318
It's always me, me, me
with this guy.

41:34.351 --> 41:36.751
Early onset narcissism.
Really?

41:36.784 --> 41:37.951
No, dude, it's not that.

41:37.984 --> 41:40.684
It's just that I don't have
time to attend a Wes Anderson...

41:40.718 --> 41:43.218
film festival while my life
is imploding.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.351
Okay, but there's a polite
way to say that.

41:45.384 --> 41:47.851
Yeah, there's also a polite,
less vain way to say...

41:47.884 --> 41:49.784
thank you when someone
compliments your film...

41:49.818 --> 41:51.951
as opposed to acting every scene
out for 'em...

41:51.984 --> 41:53.218
like Norma frickin' Desmond.

41:53.251 --> 41:55.284
Okay, take the bass out of your
voice when you're talking to me.

41:55.318 --> 41:56.951
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have bothered you.

41:56.984 --> 41:58.184
Listen, I know you're going
through a divorce.

41:58.218 --> 41:59.684
That's heartbreaking for you.
No, it's all right, it's jus‐‐

41:59.718 --> 42:00.651
You gotta forgive this guy...

42:00.684 --> 42:02.318
Wes Anderson movies go right
over his head.

42:02.351 --> 42:03.384
Okay.

42:03.418 --> 42:04.184
Let's shake it off.
No, no, dude, I get 'em fine.

42:04.218 --> 42:06.384
The fact is, I just don't
care.

42:06.418 --> 42:08.351
Oh, now all of a sudden
you don't like Wes.

42:08.384 --> 42:10.051
You're like a pit bull tonight.

42:10.084 --> 42:11.651
No, dude, it's not that.

42:11.684 --> 42:14.318
It's just that he's just,
he's kind of, I don't know...

42:14.351 --> 42:16.784
What?
Precious.

42:16.818 --> 42:17.951
Precious?
Yeah.

42:17.984 --> 42:19.118
No, he's not.
Precious.

42:19.151 --> 42:22.118
His films, they're just, they're
kind of precious, really.

42:22.151 --> 42:23.351
You know?

42:23.384 --> 42:25.884
When you're talking about his
films, you know, I'm involved...

42:25.918 --> 42:28.851
in some of those, so you're kind
of insulting me also.

42:28.884 --> 42:30.418
No, dude, it has nothing
to do with you.

42:30.451 --> 42:31.851
Yes, it does have something‐‐
It's just the way that he...

42:31.884 --> 42:33.218
shoots 'em is a little,
you know...

42:33.251 --> 42:34.818
Precious, I know, you
keep saying that.

42:34.851 --> 42:36.151
No, it's like he's trying
too hard.

42:36.184 --> 42:38.884
You know‐‐ it's self‐conscious,
you know what I mean?

42:38.918 --> 42:41.351
I really don't feel like sitting
here and letting you insult...

42:41.384 --> 42:42.518
my best friend Wes...

42:42.551 --> 42:45.018
especially when I'm trying to
help you and trying to‐‐

42:45.051 --> 42:47.184
Your best friend?
Yeah, Wes, my best friend.

42:47.218 --> 42:48.318
I think it's kinda bad taste
'cause I'm...

42:48.351 --> 42:49.518
Dude, what are you talking...

42:49.551 --> 42:52.684
You, you've said for years and
you just said a few seconds...

42:52.718 --> 42:54.351
ago that you're my
best friend.

42:54.384 --> 42:56.318
Yeah, I'm your best friend.

42:56.351 --> 42:58.151
But just because you're the
best man...

42:58.184 --> 43:00.018
at somebody's wedding, doesn't
mean they're gonna be...

43:00.051 --> 43:01.318
the best man at your wedding,
right?

43:01.351 --> 43:02.951
Dude, dude, okay, I cannot‐‐

43:02.984 --> 43:05.084
I can't even process this
right now.

43:05.118 --> 43:07.784
But even if I could, why would
you say this to me now...

43:07.818 --> 43:10.784
when I'm at my lowest point
and I most need uplift?

43:10.818 --> 43:13.351
I'm sorry , but I am trying
to give you uplift.

43:13.384 --> 43:15.418
But we were talking about
facing facts...

43:15.451 --> 43:17.418
I mean we're not
in kindergarten.

43:17.451 --> 43:18.918
So what if Wes is my
best friend?

43:18.951 --> 43:20.384
Would you stop saying
that, dude?!

43:20.418 --> 43:22.384
Hey, you need to snap out
of it and face reality...

43:22.418 --> 43:24.751
okay, 'cause in the real
world...

43:24.784 --> 43:26.918
I've known Wes a decade
longer than you.

43:26.951 --> 43:29.318
He's a great film‐maker and
he's my best friend.

43:29.351 --> 43:30.518
Now can we get back to‐‐

43:30.551 --> 43:33.051
Oh, okay, real world, real
world? You want real world, O?

43:33.084 --> 43:34.884
Huh?
That's where I try to live.

43:34.918 --> 43:37.951
Okay, in the real world,
your best friend, Wes...

43:37.984 --> 43:39.884
is a Woody Allen wannabe...

43:39.918 --> 43:42.684
and he hasn't made a good
movie since 'Bottle Rocket'.

43:42.718 --> 43:46.151
And, come to think of
it, neither have you.

43:46.184 --> 43:48.384
That's a dumb line, you know...

43:48.418 --> 43:52.018
that's a really, that's
a dumb thing to say.

43:53.751 --> 43:54.818
Yeah.
Yeah.

43:54.851 --> 43:56.051
Yeah... yeah.

43:56.084 --> 43:59.051
Yeah. You know what?
I've never, er... hey...

43:59.084 --> 44:00.918
Yeah, and you know what?
And here's the thing...

44:00.951 --> 44:02.651
is I got a movie star chin...

44:02.684 --> 44:04.351
and you got a weak,
little, chia‐seed chin.

44:04.384 --> 44:07.684
You ever noticed that? Huh?

44:07.718 --> 44:08.918
You know, I've never told
you this...

44:08.951 --> 44:12.018
but maybe now's a good time,
they offered me 'Larry Flynt'.

44:12.051 --> 44:16.018
What? The Ed Norton part?

44:16.051 --> 44:17.784
Er, no, your part.

44:17.818 --> 44:19.651
No, dude, you couldn't play
that.

44:19.684 --> 44:22.251
Oh, I couldn't? "Hey, look at
me, I'm Larry Flynt.

44:22.284 --> 44:24.918
"I'm in a wheelchair.
You're out of order."

44:24.951 --> 44:27.418
Hey, it's a lot more than
just being in a wheelchair.

44:27.451 --> 44:30.118
The fact is it's, it's, it's
a love story.

44:30.151 --> 44:32.751
Yeah, you know what I find
helps to sell a love story...

44:32.784 --> 44:34.751
is having a little sex appeal...

44:34.784 --> 44:36.751
which you haven't had
since the '80s.

44:36.784 --> 44:38.318
I had it well into the
'90s, dude.

44:38.351 --> 44:41.651
Oh, yeah, you were just oozing
sex appeal in 'Kingpin'.

44:41.684 --> 44:44.951
You know Will Farrell
stole 'Wedding Crashers'.

44:44.984 --> 44:46.051
Yeah, and he stole 'Semi Pro'...

44:46.084 --> 44:48.784
but no‐one saw it probably
because you were in it.

44:48.818 --> 44:51.318
You got out acted by a dog...

44:51.351 --> 44:52.651
in 'Marley and Me'.
No, I didn't.

44:52.684 --> 44:55.351
Oh, Marley, Marley, Marley.

44:55.384 --> 44:58.084
You're... you're a child.
You're a punk.

44:58.118 --> 44:59.818
You're a prick.
You're a dick.

44:59.851 --> 45:02.718
It's like I always say, you're
the world's angriest hippy.

45:02.751 --> 45:04.951
Hey, I'm not angry, asshole.

45:10.084 --> 45:13.384
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Is
that... he's got TV‐Q, mate.

45:15.184 --> 45:17.218
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

45:17.251 --> 45:21.184
Go on, bruv, go on.
Get him, get him. Go on.

45:21.218 --> 45:24.651
Hey, hold on. This bloke,
he looks familiar.

45:24.684 --> 45:25.851
I was just gonna say, don't
he look like that guy...

45:25.884 --> 45:28.051
Er, hang on. Jennifer Lopez in
the jungle with the snake.

45:28.084 --> 45:29.284
What's it called?

45:29.318 --> 45:30.318
'Anaconda'.

45:30.351 --> 45:33.118
Yes! He's got the voice as well.
I love this guy.

45:33.151 --> 45:34.118
- Yeah, me too, mate.
- Yeah, that's me.

45:34.151 --> 45:35.984
Can we get a quick picture?
Is that alright?

45:36.018 --> 45:38.818
I'd like to look a little
bit more presentable.

45:38.851 --> 45:40.884
No, you look great. You look
fine. Come on. Here we go.

45:40.918 --> 45:42.784
Feeling alright? Let's do that.
Alright, let's do this.

45:42.818 --> 45:44.251
Alright? You ready?

45:44.284 --> 45:46.418
Three... two, one.

45:46.451 --> 45:48.718
Yes! Let's get him a drink.
Come on.

45:48.751 --> 45:50.318
What's your Facebook?
Mojito, yeah?

45:50.351 --> 45:52.218
With mint and cocktail sticks.

45:57.451 --> 45:59.384
Cops are here!

46:03.318 --> 46:05.784
Hey, hey, in a little trouble,
wake up.

46:05.818 --> 46:08.284
Look, Mommy, there's
an airplane up in the sky.

46:08.318 --> 46:10.351
Come on. Okay, er, you'll have
to come with me, okay?

46:10.384 --> 46:12.751
What, what‐‐ what happened?

46:12.784 --> 46:15.151
You were fighting, the police
are here.

46:15.184 --> 46:17.384
Where, where, where's,
where's Owen?

46:17.418 --> 46:19.418
Just go, just go. Okay?

46:19.451 --> 46:22.051
Where is he? Oh, no.

46:22.084 --> 46:23.984
I, I have to, I have go back,
I have to go...

46:24.018 --> 46:26.118
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, cops are there.

46:26.151 --> 46:29.084
Come on.
Oh, no, man. Oh, no.

46:29.118 --> 46:30.951
Oh god.
What is it?

46:30.984 --> 46:33.784
Are you okay?
I just got into a fight with...

46:33.818 --> 46:37.318
I, I, I just‐‐
why are you helping me?

46:37.351 --> 46:39.318
Because you looked like
you needed help.

46:39.351 --> 46:40.818
I mean, do you always
help people?

46:40.851 --> 46:45.884
Ah, people, birds, dogs,
yeah, that's me.

46:50.751 --> 46:52.818
Okay, okay, okay, hurry up.

46:58.418 --> 47:00.051
Go in there.

47:00.084 --> 47:03.151
Oh my god, what is going
on tonight?

47:03.184 --> 47:06.418
It's just like I'm being
tested or something.

47:06.451 --> 47:09.351
What is going on?

47:09.384 --> 47:11.951
Hey, don't cross your arms...

47:11.984 --> 47:13.418
you're blocking your heart
chakra.

47:13.451 --> 47:16.818
Oh... yeah.

47:16.851 --> 47:19.184
Can I touch you?

47:19.218 --> 47:20.751
Wh, where? What? Why?
Ssh.

47:20.784 --> 47:23.884
Sshhh, sshhh.

47:27.418 --> 47:31.218
Here you have a problem.

47:31.251 --> 47:34.118
And here even bigger problem.

47:34.151 --> 47:36.951
I believe you.

47:36.984 --> 47:38.951
I need you to close your
eyes now.

47:38.984 --> 47:41.018
Why?

47:41.051 --> 47:42.784
Just trust me.

48:28.051 --> 48:31.084
You can open your eyes now.

48:31.118 --> 48:33.651
That was beautiful.

48:33.684 --> 48:35.918
I know.

48:35.951 --> 48:40.951
It says how all the gypsies
want jewelery and horses.

48:40.984 --> 48:45.784
But how she's a gypsy and she
just needs love.

48:45.818 --> 48:48.084
This is how you solve
your problem.

48:48.118 --> 48:51.951
You need to find what you love.

48:53.451 --> 48:55.018
Anyone in there? Police!

48:55.051 --> 48:56.018
Oh.

48:58.251 --> 49:00.684
Get up on the seat, come on.

49:09.761 --> 49:11.494
Hello?

49:15.294 --> 49:17.394
Hello?

49:30.461 --> 49:31.294
Hello?

49:31.328 --> 49:33.461
Sorry, this one's occupied.

49:41.461 --> 49:43.361
Why can't I see your feet?

49:43.394 --> 49:46.361
Why are you looking?

49:46.394 --> 49:47.561
What are you doing?

49:47.594 --> 49:51.928
I am a Moroccan,
we squat on top of the toilet.

49:51.961 --> 49:55.261
Okay, er, have you got someone
in there with you?

49:55.294 --> 49:57.661
No, I can pee on my own.

49:59.694 --> 50:01.328
Hey, bugger off, weirdo!

50:01.361 --> 50:03.361
Excuse me, miss.

50:11.828 --> 50:14.994
He's gone.
Okay, let's go.

50:15.028 --> 50:17.994
Hey, promise me you'll
stop resisting.

50:18.028 --> 50:19.694
Oh, I'm, I'm not resisting.

50:19.728 --> 50:22.828
Hey, you are holding a lot
of fear, my friend.

50:22.861 --> 50:24.661
Yeah, that's true.

50:24.694 --> 50:27.861
Are you afraid of me?
A little.

50:29.828 --> 50:31.461
Just breathe.

50:31.494 --> 50:32.794
This is a weird place
to breathe.

50:32.828 --> 50:35.461
Hey, breathe.
I can't.

50:35.494 --> 50:36.928
Yes, you can.
I can't.

50:36.961 --> 50:39.661
Yes, you can.
I can't.

50:43.328 --> 50:46.428
I'm going to help you now.

50:46.461 --> 50:48.828
Take my breath.

50:56.694 --> 50:58.461
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

50:58.494 --> 51:02.861
You threw up on me.
I am so, so, so sorry.

51:02.894 --> 51:07.394
Oh my god, you threw up on me!

51:09.628 --> 51:11.794
Oh, please forgive me,
I'm so sorry.

51:11.828 --> 51:13.861
Oh my god!
Can I just...

51:13.894 --> 51:16.761
It barely got you. Let me see.
It's not that bad.

51:16.794 --> 51:21.294
Don't, just don't.
No. Let me... just‐‐

51:21.328 --> 51:22.594
Oh god.
Oh, please forgive me.

51:22.628 --> 51:23.994
I don't know where that
came from.

51:24.028 --> 51:24.961
What, what are you two
doing here?

51:24.994 --> 51:27.561
I said... can you take
that commotion outside.

51:27.594 --> 51:30.494
He threw up inside my mouth.
Blood of Jesus.

51:30.528 --> 51:31.761
Oh god.

51:31.794 --> 51:33.694
Get out, the police are
looking for‐‐

51:38.294 --> 51:41.028
Are you okay?
Yeah.

51:41.061 --> 51:43.361
Oh, please, please forgive me.
I'm so sorry.

51:46.628 --> 51:48.428
Oh God, I...

51:48.461 --> 51:51.528
Hey, it, it, it's all vegan
and organic if that helps.

51:51.561 --> 51:53.628
Are you kidding me?!

51:53.661 --> 51:55.761
I, I'm just...

51:55.794 --> 51:58.028
Oh my God.

51:58.061 --> 52:00.628
I don't know, I just got
nauseous, I...

52:00.661 --> 52:03.894
God, this is the worst
night of my life.

52:03.928 --> 52:07.961
Oh God. I wish we could‐‐

52:07.994 --> 52:10.694
Where are the cops?

52:10.728 --> 52:13.028
Thank you.

52:13.061 --> 52:15.561
Okay.

quid for a sandwich?

No, no, no, no. I mean,
I'm the angel, dude.

52:52.928 --> 52:55.494
I gave that to her and I need
it because I gotta get a cab.

52:55.528 --> 52:57.261
Well, it doesn't, it doesn't
look like you need it.

52:57.294 --> 52:59.728
I mean, I mean, look, you're
stood there like all smug...

52:59.761 --> 53:01.561
and stuff and like with all
your flash gear on.

53:01.594 --> 53:03.561
I'm like in a wheelchair, mate.

53:03.594 --> 53:05.928
Dude, I, I just, I just
need enough to get home.

53:05.961 --> 53:07.294
Do you, do you have like
five quid or something?

53:07.328 --> 53:08.461
Yeah, well I need a sandwich.

53:08.494 --> 53:10.561
I haven't eaten in like
three days.

53:10.594 --> 53:12.761
Well, what do you need a
fifty‐pound sandwich?

53:12.794 --> 53:13.861
I mean, do you have any
more money?

53:13.894 --> 53:15.494
No.

53:15.528 --> 53:17.428
Dude, please, can I...

53:17.461 --> 53:19.861
I, I know you have something
for me. I just need five...

53:19.894 --> 53:21.461
Are you begging a beggar
for money?

53:21.494 --> 53:23.328
No, no, I'm just, I need
to get home, okay?

53:23.361 --> 53:24.494
You're getting too close.
No, no, no, dude‐‐

53:24.528 --> 53:25.528
I just need to get home.
Don't come any closer, please.

53:25.561 --> 53:27.628
Don't scare him!
Look, just stand back, will you!

53:27.661 --> 53:28.561
Okay.

53:28.594 --> 53:30.261
How many times do I have
to bloody tell you!

53:30.294 --> 53:31.461
Okay, calm down, man.
I'm so sorry, miss.

53:31.494 --> 53:32.594
It's absolutely nothing to do...
No, it's okay, it's not you.

53:32.628 --> 53:34.661
with you, it really hasn't.
But you're a dick, mate.

53:34.694 --> 53:35.628
Dude...

53:35.661 --> 53:37.961
I've told you once before,
now bugger off!

53:37.994 --> 53:39.828

No, no! No, stop! Stop!

53:44.628 --> 53:47.494
Oh lovely, lovely, Woody.
Lovely.

53:47.528 --> 53:48.494
Stop it!

53:48.528 --> 53:50.494
Get angry, that's it, lovely,
mate. Lovely.

53:50.528 --> 53:53.394
My camera! He's broken my
camera! Lovely.

53:53.428 --> 53:55.994
Stop it!

53:58.328 --> 54:01.561
Woody Allen, this is not
your best self!

54:12.028 --> 54:13.994
Sloane Hotel, please.

54:18.494 --> 54:20.728
Everything alright there, mate?

54:20.761 --> 54:23.028
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
It's fine.

54:23.061 --> 54:24.794
Do you know what time it is?

54:24.828 --> 54:27.394
Er, 11:30. What's going
on back there?

54:27.428 --> 54:29.461
Er, nothing, nothing, it's
all good.

54:29.494 --> 54:30.694
Yeah, well it looks like
a lot of something...

54:30.728 --> 54:31.894
to be nothing, eh, mate?

54:31.928 --> 54:33.961
No, no, dude, dude...

54:33.994 --> 54:35.661
Er, are you bleeding?
What?

54:35.694 --> 54:37.694
Are you bleeding? Are you
bleeding, mate?

54:37.728 --> 54:38.628
You're bleeding!

54:38.661 --> 54:40.828
No, no, no, I'm not bleeding.
I'm fine.

54:40.861 --> 54:43.828
Yes, you are. You're like a
bloody geyser, mate.

54:43.861 --> 54:44.828
No, I'm fine, mate.

54:44.861 --> 54:46.694
Ah, are you being real with me?

54:46.728 --> 54:48.794
I'm not being anything
with you, dude.

54:48.828 --> 54:51.728
Just‐‐ I'm just...
everything's fine.

54:51.761 --> 54:54.828
Don't you get anything‐‐ don't
you get anything on my seats.

54:54.861 --> 54:56.828
Dude, d'you have any,
do you have a Kleenex?

54:56.861 --> 54:58.828
Don't you get anything on
my damn seats!

54:58.861 --> 55:00.828
Dude, I won't get any blood
on your filthy seats.

55:00.861 --> 55:02.828
If you give me a Kleenex,
I'll get it...

55:02.861 --> 55:04.994
Or, or you will be paying for
the cleaning of this cab.

55:05.028 --> 55:07.994
Dude, I'm not gonna have
to pay for anything. Okay?

55:08.028 --> 55:09.994
Oh, oh yes you will, mate.
You'll be paying.

55:10.028 --> 55:12.661
If there is the slightest
drop of blood...

55:12.694 --> 55:14.561
anywhere in this cab, you will
be paying.

55:14.594 --> 55:17.561
Okay. Shouldn't you just be
focused on your driving?

55:17.594 --> 55:21.794
Oh, no, you will be charged
a full valet. Right?

55:21.828 --> 55:23.794
You will be steam‐cleaning
the bleedin' engine...

55:23.828 --> 55:25.728
after this ride, my friend.

55:25.761 --> 55:28.728
Okay, okay, mate. Okay, great.

55:28.761 --> 55:30.728
Just, just focus on
your driving, alright?

55:30.761 --> 55:33.794
Just take that and stop
the blood, mate.

55:33.828 --> 55:36.261
Thanks, mate, that's all I
ever asked you for.

55:36.294 --> 55:38.528
Alright, just, just stop
the damn blood, will ya?

55:41.494 --> 55:42.594
Is this used?

55:42.628 --> 55:44.828
Well, I got sinuses, ain't I?

55:44.861 --> 55:46.928
I'm not pulling out brand new
ones just for you.

55:46.961 --> 55:49.594
Dude, that is disgusting.

55:55.728 --> 55:58.594
Er, er, what's going on back
there? What was that noise?

55:58.628 --> 56:00.761
No, no, it's nothing,
it's just the ashtray.

56:00.794 --> 56:01.894
What, what d'you mean just
the ashtray?

56:01.928 --> 56:03.261
What you done?
Nothing.

56:03.294 --> 56:04.561
Oh, you've, you've broken
it, ain't ya?

56:04.594 --> 56:06.294
No, dude, it, it was like this.

56:06.328 --> 56:08.894
Oi, what the hell are you doing
messing with the ashtray?!

56:08.928 --> 56:11.594
Dude, I don't know, what
is this, like an antique cab...

56:11.628 --> 56:13.928

ashtrays or something?

56:13.961 --> 56:16.961
Oh... I mean, what... what
the... you know what?

56:16.994 --> 56:19.928
Just stop the car.
No, no.

56:19.961 --> 56:21.928
Stop the car cos I'm
getting out.

56:21.961 --> 56:23.928
No, you're not getting out
this cab.

56:23.961 --> 56:24.761
Dude...

56:24.794 --> 56:26.928
Not until you pay for
the ashtray.

56:26.961 --> 56:28.928
stop this damn car because
I'm getting out now.

56:28.961 --> 56:29.928
No!

56:29.961 --> 56:30.728
You're not getting out
the cab!

56:30.761 --> 56:32.928
Not till you pay for
the ashtray!

56:32.961 --> 56:33.894
Dude, this is kidnapping.

56:33.928 --> 56:35.928
No, you stupid
bastard, destroying my cab!

56:35.961 --> 56:37.528
Dude, you better stop
this friggin' cab right now.

56:37.561 --> 56:39.394
No. No. No.
Stop it! Stop it!

56:39.428 --> 56:42.494
No. No. No.
Stop this damn cab!

56:42.528 --> 56:44.461
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Everybody calm down!

56:44.494 --> 56:46.261
Everybody calm down!

56:46.294 --> 56:47.761
Dude, I will break this
fucking thing...

56:47.794 --> 56:49.761
No, don't you dare! I'm pulling
over! Pulling over!

56:49.794 --> 56:52.794
Get out! Out, out!

56:58.061 --> 57:00.261
You silly bollocks!

57:00.294 --> 57:02.961
You're the silly bollocks!
Piss off!

57:47.561 --> 57:49.628
Sloane Hotel, please.

57:53.661 --> 57:55.928
So just, can you, can you hurry?
Eh?

57:55.961 --> 57:58.828
Just go a little faster.
Uh?

57:58.861 --> 58:01.461
Go right on, go right on.
Please.

58:01.494 --> 58:02.961
Go... shit.

58:02.994 --> 58:05.261
Go through the lights, dude,
just go through the lights.

58:05.294 --> 58:06.928
What's the hurry?

58:06.961 --> 58:10.594
Life is about the journey
not the destination.

58:10.628 --> 58:13.694
No, no, I assure you right now
it is about the destination.

58:13.728 --> 58:15.828
We're in the hands of
the Goddess Kali.

58:15.861 --> 58:18.828
She's a creator and destroyer.

58:18.861 --> 58:20.661
It all depends on the mood
she's in.

58:20.694 --> 58:23.628
Well, I don't think she's in
a very good mood tonight.

58:26.061 --> 58:30.728
The stars can't shine
without darkness.

58:34.928 --> 58:37.461
In the spirit of full
disclosure, I gotta tell you...

58:37.494 --> 58:38.561
I don't have any money on me.

58:38.594 --> 58:40.494
Mmm.

58:42.961 --> 58:45.794
Can you speak a piece
of verse for me?

58:45.828 --> 58:47.994
Something uplifting.

58:50.328 --> 58:52.361
I, I, I memorized this when
I was seven.

58:52.394 --> 58:57.294
I told the sun that I was glad,
I'm sure I don't know why.

58:57.328 --> 59:00.761
Somehow the pleasant way it
had of shining in the sky...

59:00.794 --> 59:03.794
just put a notion in my
head that wouldn't it be fun...

59:03.828 --> 59:08.794
if while walking on the hill,
I said I'm happy to the sun.

59:08.828 --> 59:13.394
That's beautiful. I feel
I should be paying you.

59:13.428 --> 59:16.794
No, no, no, we'll just call it
even, you know, and that's fine.

59:16.828 --> 59:19.828
I'll tell you what...
Uh?

59:19.861 --> 59:23.028
You, you, you just pull over
right here, this is fine, sir.

59:23.061 --> 59:26.394
Thank you so much.
You're a gentleman.

59:29.661 --> 59:31.694
Stop there! Stop there!
Don't make me run.

59:31.728 --> 59:35.528
Stop there now! Go, go, go.

59:39.328 --> 59:41.594
Suspect is on the playground.

59:47.728 --> 59:50.794
Spread out. He's in here
somewhere.

59:55.028 --> 59:59.561
Come on down. Come on down,
we know you're up there.

01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:04.261
How?
I can see you.

01:00:09.028 --> 01:00:12.861
Don't. Don't!

01:00:12.894 --> 01:00:15.694
Put your hands on your head.
Put your hands on your head.

01:00:15.728 --> 01:00:18.028
This is over an ashtray.
Put your hands on your head now!

01:00:18.061 --> 01:00:21.294
I can't. If I take my hands off
my knees, I'm gonna fall down.

01:00:21.328 --> 01:00:22.328
You have the right to
remain silent.

01:00:22.361 --> 01:00:23.594
Put your hands on your head!
Oi, he's a menace.

01:00:23.628 --> 01:00:25.294
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

01:00:25.328 --> 01:00:27.528
He's an absolute menace!
You're a menace!

01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:29.661
He's a raving lunatic.
Lock him up.

01:00:29.694 --> 01:00:32.028
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:33.894
You understand?
Yeah.

01:00:33.928 --> 01:00:36.294
Are you who I think you are?
I hope not.

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:38.328
Were you in a fight with
Owen Wilson earlier?

01:00:38.361 --> 01:00:39.494
Maybe.

01:00:39.528 --> 01:00:40.628
Do you know what the cops
in the US would do to you...

01:00:40.661 --> 01:00:41.861
for running like that? Yeah,
they would have shot ya.

01:00:41.894 --> 01:00:45.894
And you'd be dead by now and the
world would be a better place.

01:00:45.928 --> 01:00:47.361
You see what I'm dealing
with, man?

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:48.628
I think I do.

01:00:48.661 --> 01:00:50.294
He kidnapped me. He wouldn't
stop the car.

01:00:50.328 --> 01:00:52.328
You were the one running, sir.

01:00:52.361 --> 01:00:56.328
He's off his conkers,
mate. Hang him. Hang him!

01:01:06.028 --> 01:01:08.894
You seem kinda young to be
doing this.

01:01:08.928 --> 01:01:10.761
You're my first arrest.

01:01:10.794 --> 01:01:13.694
Really? I'm flattered.

01:01:13.728 --> 01:01:16.961
I'm not sure you mean it.

01:01:16.994 --> 01:01:19.461
Listen, is, is it necessary
to go to the station?

01:01:19.494 --> 01:01:22.628
I mean, is there any way I could
just pay a fine or something?

01:01:22.661 --> 01:01:25.361
Are you offering me a bribe?
No.

01:01:25.394 --> 01:01:27.361
Then you're going to
the station.

01:01:27.394 --> 01:01:33.261
Oh, that's good, you got me.
You Irish?

01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:35.761
Through and through.

01:01:35.794 --> 01:01:38.428
Oh, you know, I spent a month
in Galway one time.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:40.461
I drank a lorry load
of Guinness.

01:01:40.494 --> 01:01:42.294
I love Guinness.

01:01:42.328 --> 01:01:43.994
Well, my wife says I love it
too much.

01:01:44.028 --> 01:01:46.594
Oh, ah, married, huh? Kids?

01:01:46.628 --> 01:01:48.594
Son. Seven year old.

01:01:48.628 --> 01:01:51.794
Oh, must have had him
in high school.

01:01:51.828 --> 01:01:53.694
I did actually, yeah.

01:01:53.728 --> 01:01:56.261
What, you did the right
thing, got married?

01:01:56.294 --> 01:01:58.428
Yeah... did the right thing,
yeah.

01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:00.428
Isn't that life's great mission?

01:02:00.461 --> 01:02:02.428
Were you at the birth?

01:02:02.461 --> 01:02:03.994
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:02:04.028 --> 01:02:07.394
Oh, man, the greatest feeling
in the world. I had home births.

01:02:09.028 --> 01:02:11.328
You?
Er, hospital.

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:12.894
She had a difficult pregnancy.

01:02:12.928 --> 01:02:14.028
Oh, the kid's okay?

01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:18.894
Yeah, yeah. He's, er, er...

01:02:18.928 --> 01:02:22.461
That'll be us nearly there now.
Won't be long.

01:02:22.494 --> 01:02:23.661
Oh, dude, I'm sorry to pry.

01:02:23.694 --> 01:02:28.394
No, no, he's, er, he's just
special. He's got special needs.

01:02:28.428 --> 01:02:30.761
Well you must love him all
the more.

01:02:30.794 --> 01:02:33.928
I do. I do, he's incredible.

01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:37.961
It must be tough sometimes.

01:02:37.994 --> 01:02:39.728
Yeah. Yeah, it can be.

01:02:39.761 --> 01:02:41.661
I mean I don't know why
I worry...

01:02:41.694 --> 01:02:43.561
he's as happy as can be,
you know.

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:46.694
It's just he's so pure,
you know...

01:02:46.728 --> 01:02:50.328
and the world can be a little
bit, er... um...

01:02:52.661 --> 01:02:54.428
Oh, hey, um, I'm, I'm
sorry, man.

01:02:54.461 --> 01:02:55.561
No, it's alright, man.

01:02:55.594 --> 01:02:57.928
I'm a fixer, I wanna fix
everyone's problems. Stupid.

01:02:57.961 --> 01:02:59.961
Well, you... my kids are
six and nine.

01:02:59.994 --> 01:03:02.961
We should, I mean we should
get 'em together sometime.

01:03:02.994 --> 01:03:04.661
Really?
Yeah.

01:03:04.694 --> 01:03:06.961
You, er, they could use
a playmate.

01:03:06.994 --> 01:03:09.994
What's your name?
I'm Constable Hughes.

01:03:13.694 --> 01:03:17.528
Yeah, so, er, you, you
like Bono?

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:19.694
Just because I'm Irish,
I'm supposed to like him?

01:03:19.728 --> 01:03:21.694
No.
I love him.

01:03:21.728 --> 01:03:23.694
Oh, you got me again.

01:03:23.728 --> 01:03:24.928
Well, I mean, what you put
your energy into...

01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:26.761
tells me all I need to know
about you.

01:03:26.794 --> 01:03:27.928
Bono could do anything
he wants...

01:03:27.961 --> 01:03:29.294
in a world full of suffering
people.

01:03:29.328 --> 01:03:31.294
He just tries to help on
a massive scale.

01:03:31.328 --> 01:03:33.294
I quite admire that in the man.
I think he's a poet.

01:03:33.328 --> 01:03:35.694
And, yeah, I'm damn proud
he's Irish.

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:37.961
You wanna talk with him?

01:03:37.994 --> 01:03:40.461
You what?
Talk with Bono?

01:03:40.494 --> 01:03:43.561
Talk with Bono now?
Yeah, right now. Right now.

01:03:43.594 --> 01:03:44.494
What like you could just
call him?

01:03:44.528 --> 01:03:47.628
Yeah. Yeah, just, er, grab
my Blackberry.

01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:48.628
It's right there in my pocket.

01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:50.628
It's right there.
Okay.

01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:54.294
Yeah, just grab it and he's‐‐
he's‐‐ he's under 'B'.

01:03:54.328 --> 01:03:56.694
Oh, 'B' like 'buzzing'?

01:03:56.728 --> 01:03:58.494
Er, 'B' like after 'A'.

01:03:58.528 --> 01:04:01.828
All right, here we go...
it's a 3‐4‐3 number.

01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:03.594
Yeah, yeah, Ireland.

01:04:03.628 --> 01:04:07.494
All right, here we go,
Bono on speaker phone.

01:04:12.428 --> 01:04:13.628
ALI
Hello?

01:04:13.661 --> 01:04:16.294
Ali, how you doing? It's Wood.

01:04:16.328 --> 01:04:17.994
Woody, great to hear from you.

01:04:18.028 --> 01:04:20.361
You're not back in Dublin,
are you?

01:04:20.394 --> 01:04:22.428
No, no, no, I'm in London.

01:04:22.461 --> 01:04:25.328
Well you certainly made a big
impression on your last trip.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:26.961
What d'you mean?

01:04:26.994 --> 01:04:30.828
You told Bono smoking pot
would fix his glaucoma.

01:04:30.861 --> 01:04:34.461
Now the tour has been put off,
the album's been put back...

01:04:34.494 --> 01:04:38.894
and he tells anyone who listens
the Irish invented Reggae.

01:04:38.928 --> 01:04:42.828
I hope you're happy.
Hold on.

01:04:42.861 --> 01:04:46.328
BONO
Irie man... good vibrations...

01:04:46.361 --> 01:04:49.294
all across the nation.
What's up with man?

01:04:49.328 --> 01:04:50.528
Oh, hey, hey, buddy.

01:04:50.561 --> 01:04:53.828
You know you gotta be a little
bit cautious with that medicine.

01:04:53.861 --> 01:04:54.994
It's very strong.

01:04:55.028 --> 01:04:59.394
Um, but listen, I, I got a,
a friend here, you know...

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:00.861
er, who wants to say hi,
a fellow Irishman.

01:05:00.894 --> 01:05:02.861
Hello, this is Paddy
Hughes speaking.

01:05:02.894 --> 01:05:06.294
BONO Any friend
of Woody be a friend of mine.

01:05:06.328 --> 01:05:07.461
He's not me friend.

01:05:07.494 --> 01:05:10.794
<i>All brethren are friends,</i>
<i>Paddy Hughes...</i>

01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:14.261
for the kiss of the serpent
is like sugar...

01:05:14.294 --> 01:05:17.528
in comparison to the heart
of a friendless man.

01:05:17.561 --> 01:05:20.628
Yeah, okay. Er, but he's broken
the law, Bono.

01:05:20.661 --> 01:05:22.628
BONO
Are you his cell mate?

01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:25.628
More like his jailer. Listen,
sir, I really respect you.

01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:28.594
I've always wanted to meet you.
I think you're just brilliant.

01:05:28.628 --> 01:05:30.294
BONO
Jah, bless you, sir.

01:05:30.328 --> 01:05:31.628
I mean I loved your first
album and your second album.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.661
Just absolutely the best.

01:05:34.694 --> 01:05:35.961
- But...
- BONO But?

01:05:35.994 --> 01:05:38.294
No buts.
Well, I've just...

01:05:38.328 --> 01:05:39.461
BONO
Yeah?

01:05:39.494 --> 01:05:40.461
Well, I mean after 'October'...

01:05:40.494 --> 01:05:42.561
it feels like you just kinda
sold out a bit.

01:05:42.594 --> 01:05:43.894
BONO Sold out?
No, dude.

01:05:43.928 --> 01:05:45.828
Yeah, it's like you've kinda
let yourself down.

01:05:45.861 --> 01:05:50.361
No, er, Bono, Constable Hughes
is a big fan of yours and, and‐‐

01:05:50.394 --> 01:05:52.428
I mean I quite like Larry.
I mean he's the business.

01:05:52.461 --> 01:05:54.794
Tune me into your
thinking there, Wood.

01:05:54.828 --> 01:05:56.294
No, I, I just thought that
it'd be good...

01:05:56.328 --> 01:05:57.894
for you guys to talk, you know.

01:05:57.928 --> 01:05:59.461
I don't, I don't think Larry
would let fame...

01:05:59.494 --> 01:06:00.894
get to his head as such,
you know.

01:06:00.928 --> 01:06:04.428
<i>BONO Rasta can't</i>
<i>deal with Babylon right now.</i>

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:05.761
Okay?

01:06:05.794 --> 01:06:08.394
Hey, er, Bono, I think that
you guys could be...

01:06:08.428 --> 01:06:12.294
very, very good friends,
I really do. Bono?

01:06:13.528 --> 01:06:14.928
I think he's hung up.

01:06:14.961 --> 01:06:16.928
Why did you tell him he
sold out?

01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:18.961
Well someone had to tell him.

01:06:18.994 --> 01:06:22.028
Well, I mean, but what happened
to all the good stuff...

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.794
he does for mankind?

01:06:23.828 --> 01:06:24.828
And, then like you know
he's a poet.

01:06:24.861 --> 01:06:27.361
Well, he needed to be told.
He needed to be told.

01:06:27.394 --> 01:06:28.594
Well, alright, it's good
that you met.

01:06:28.628 --> 01:06:30.828
Listen, dude, is there anyway
you could give me a break here?

01:06:30.861 --> 01:06:32.694
I mean, just let me loose.
You ask for this favor...

01:06:32.728 --> 01:06:34.928
a little quick off the heels
of making nice. Let's go, sir.

01:06:36.394 --> 01:06:38.794
Okay, but... listen, my kids...

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:41.394
they're going to Leavesden
Studios in the morning...

01:06:41.428 --> 01:06:43.528
because they're going to the
Ha‐Harry Potter set.

01:06:43.561 --> 01:06:46.428
And it's the last day of filming
and we have to be there by 7:30.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.528
Yeah, let's get you in there.

01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:48.828
Oh, okay but I mean...

01:06:48.861 --> 01:06:49.994
Can I call my wife?

01:06:50.028 --> 01:06:52.928
I, I gotta, I told her I'd be
home by midnight and...

01:06:52.961 --> 01:06:54.628
er, what, what time can I
be released?

01:06:54.661 --> 01:06:55.928
Well, that depends.
On what?

01:06:55.961 --> 01:06:57.428
On whether you need to see
the magistrate.

01:06:57.461 --> 01:06:59.361
When's the magistrate?
Let's go.

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:00.794
You like Paul McCartney?

01:07:00.828 --> 01:07:02.294
Let's go.

01:07:05.694 --> 01:07:07.728
Stand behind the yellow line.

01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:12.494
Did I tell you to uncuff him?

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:13.694
Sorry.

01:07:14.894 --> 01:07:15.994
Uncuff him.
Yeah.

01:07:16.028 --> 01:07:19.361
So, you're the one.

01:07:19.394 --> 01:07:22.361
Well, yeah, I'm the one
who assaulted an ashtray.

01:07:22.394 --> 01:07:23.628
You drunk?

01:07:23.661 --> 01:07:24.794
I wish.

01:07:24.828 --> 01:07:27.728
Empty your pockets.

01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:29.694
Well you're, you're not gonna
strip search me and make me...

01:07:29.728 --> 01:07:31.928
spread my cheeks and all that,
are you?

01:07:32.686 --> 01:07:35.219
Do you expect special treatment?
No.

01:07:35.253 --> 01:07:37.653
Then, no.
You guys are funny.

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:42.153
Er... hey... there you go.

01:07:42.186 --> 01:07:45.186
One Blackberry.

01:07:48.586 --> 01:07:53.986
One room key, to the
Sloane Hotel.

01:07:54.019 --> 01:07:56.053
Dude, you don't have to let
every criminal in here...

01:07:56.086 --> 01:07:57.286
know where I live.

01:07:57.319 --> 01:08:00.653
Oh, they know where you live,
with them.

01:08:03.153 --> 01:08:06.086
Er...
One pen.

01:08:08.319 --> 01:08:11.053
One Chelsea lighter.

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:13.386
You, you don't like those
overpaid poofters, do you?

01:08:13.419 --> 01:08:16.053
No, I mean, someone just gave‐‐
who do you like?

01:08:16.086 --> 01:08:17.553
Charlton Athletic.

01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:20.653
Charlton? Oh, there's, there's a
great group, gang, squad, um...

01:08:20.685 --> 01:08:22.653
they're, they're, they're
just, er, they're strong.

01:08:22.685 --> 01:08:24.752
And bottom of the league.

01:08:24.786 --> 01:08:30.719
Bottom? Well, nowhere to go
but up. That's good news.

01:08:30.752 --> 01:08:33.419
One comb. What's that for?

01:08:33.453 --> 01:08:36.219
To comb with.

01:08:36.252 --> 01:08:39.453
What do you comb? Lice out
your pubes?

01:08:39.486 --> 01:08:42.319
What, what, er...

01:08:42.353 --> 01:08:44.419
Do you know what time it is?
It's 11:45.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.519
My tea‐time.
Can I make a phone call?

01:08:46.553 --> 01:08:47.752
No.
Yeah.

01:08:47.786 --> 01:08:50.685
When's the magistrate come?
9:00 AM.

01:08:50.719 --> 01:08:52.653
Dude, 9:00 AM? That's way
too late.

01:08:52.685 --> 01:08:55.618
I'm going to Leavesden Studios.
I have to be there 7:30 sharp.

01:08:55.653 --> 01:08:57.986
My kids are gonna meet
Harry Potter.

01:08:58.019 --> 01:09:02.118
Ooh, lah‐ti‐dah. Life of a
Hollywood star, eh.

01:09:02.153 --> 01:09:03.685
You just seem predisposed
to dislike me.

01:09:03.719 --> 01:09:06.185
That was my brother.
Your brother?

01:09:06.219 --> 01:09:08.185
In the cab.
In the cab?

01:09:08.219 --> 01:09:09.185
Brother‐in‐law.

01:09:09.219 --> 01:09:11.185
Your brother‐in‐law was
the guy...

01:09:11.219 --> 01:09:14.219
So when he was calling someone
on the phone, that was...

01:09:14.252 --> 01:09:15.453
Moi.

01:09:15.486 --> 01:09:16.953
Parlez vous francais?
No.

01:09:21.685 --> 01:09:24.086
Listen, if I'd have met your
brother‐in‐law under different..

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.752
circumstances, we would have had
a pint and a laugh, you know.

01:09:26.786 --> 01:09:29.386
We just, just had some
bad luck.

01:09:29.419 --> 01:09:31.386
You certainly did.

01:09:31.419 --> 01:09:33.286
And tonight, while you're
lying in a cold cell...

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:38.019
on a metal slab where hundreds
of guys have sweated, belched...

01:09:38.053 --> 01:09:40.185
farted, pissed, puked, bled,
wanked and defecated...

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:44.118
and you can't sleep from
the stench...

01:09:44.153 --> 01:09:48.286
picture me sitting with my
brother‐in‐law in a warm pub...

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.986
with a pint and a packet
of salt and vinegar crisps...

01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:52.953
having a laugh, over you.

01:09:55.186 --> 01:09:57.153
What's that?
Ah... nothing.

01:09:57.186 --> 01:09:59.453
Is that what I think it is?
No, no, no, it's nothing.

01:09:59.486 --> 01:10:00.553
It's just I‐‐
It's cannabis.

01:10:00.586 --> 01:10:01.719
I don't even know what
it is, dude.

01:10:01.753 --> 01:10:03.986
We shall see. Give it to me now.
I‐‐ I don't know where‐‐

01:10:04.019 --> 01:10:06.353
Give it to me now.
Give it to him now!

01:10:06.386 --> 01:10:10.153
You bastard... you had a
cannabis cigarette...

01:10:10.186 --> 01:10:12.186
and that's going in the records,
search him.

01:10:29.119 --> 01:10:31.519
Only this.

01:10:31.553 --> 01:10:37.686
A feather. What's that for?
Hmm, tickle your balls, eh?

01:10:37.719 --> 01:10:41.719
Tickle, tickle, dirty, dirty
little Yankee doodle dandy, eh?

01:10:41.753 --> 01:10:44.653
My daughter gave that to
me for luck.

01:10:44.686 --> 01:10:47.453
Well, it don't seem to
be working, does it, eh?

01:10:47.486 --> 01:10:49.219
Step this way.

01:10:52.119 --> 01:10:54.253
Hey, take it easy.

01:10:54.286 --> 01:10:56.053
Hey, Woody, how you doing,
man?

01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:57.253
Oh, never better.

01:10:57.286 --> 01:11:01.986
Ah, I saw your play.
Oh, great, thanks.

01:11:02.019 --> 01:11:05.353
What a load of bullshit.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:08.753
I thought I'd ask for my money
back but, er, I snuck in.

01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:11.453
You ever gonna make us
laugh again?

01:11:11.486 --> 01:11:13.053
Well I, I doubt it, dude.

01:11:13.086 --> 01:11:15.519
I feel like I'm stuck in a
drama bubble.

01:11:15.553 --> 01:11:17.386
What they got you for?

01:11:17.419 --> 01:11:19.253
Oh, molesting an ashtray.

01:11:19.286 --> 01:11:21.253
Can you mind your own
business, please.

01:11:21.286 --> 01:11:24.253
They'll let you go if you pay
them. It's all about the money.

01:11:24.286 --> 01:11:26.453
Shut it, Eugene.
Euu‐jen.

01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:29.119
Is that true?
Step aside and wait your turn.

01:11:29.153 --> 01:11:33.086
Moron. Watch the birdie.

01:11:33.119 --> 01:11:35.086
Right hand first, starting
with the thumb...

01:11:35.119 --> 01:11:36.586
rolling from left to right.

01:11:36.619 --> 01:11:39.453
Er, but, dude, can I get
out if I post, post bail?

01:11:39.486 --> 01:11:40.753
Yeah.
No.

01:11:40.786 --> 01:11:42.719
Well, if we decide you're
not a flight risk.

01:11:42.753 --> 01:11:44.386
Did someone ask you, Paddy?
No, sir.

01:11:44.419 --> 01:11:45.986
And are you doing the deciding?
I am not, sir.

01:11:46.019 --> 01:11:47.153
Then stay out of it.

01:11:47.186 --> 01:11:49.319
But you know I'm not a flight
risk, you know where I live.

01:11:49.353 --> 01:11:52.386
The Sloane Hotel...
bail is 1,000 pounds.

01:11:52.419 --> 01:11:56.386
Dude, that ashtray was useless.
It was like the cab's appendix.

01:11:56.419 --> 01:11:58.286
Just pay it, man.

01:11:58.319 --> 01:11:59.753
I don't have any cash, man.

01:11:59.786 --> 01:12:01.753
Well, you can use a credit
card, but they don't take Amex.

01:12:01.786 --> 01:12:03.753
Shut up!
Nazis.

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:07.086
I‐I don't have my wallet
on me, because‐‐

01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:08.586
Then I guess you'll have to
wait for the magistrate.

01:12:08.619 --> 01:12:10.986
Whoa, pity.
You travel without a wallet?

01:12:11.019 --> 01:12:13.719
You're so ghetto, aren't you?
So Hollywood.

01:12:13.753 --> 01:12:16.019
Dude, can I please call my wife?

01:12:16.053 --> 01:12:18.986
I mean, we've been, we've
been having some trouble...

01:12:19.019 --> 01:12:20.419
and, and I‐‐ I‐‐ I have
to call her.

01:12:20.453 --> 01:12:22.019
I told her I'd be there
by midnight.

01:12:22.053 --> 01:12:24.153
Can I please make a call?

01:12:24.186 --> 01:12:27.453
After you make your statement,
you can make one call.

01:12:27.486 --> 01:12:29.386
Take him away.
Thank you.

01:12:29.419 --> 01:12:31.619
I mean, I think you're a
closet people person.

01:12:31.653 --> 01:12:33.086
Thank you, sir.

01:12:33.119 --> 01:12:34.286
Hey, get a new agent, man.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.519
Are you trying to make
trouble for yourself?

01:12:39.553 --> 01:12:42.519
No, no. I mean my wife is
gonna liberate me.

01:12:42.553 --> 01:12:43.353
Well that's up to him...

01:12:43.386 --> 01:12:45.019
if he decides you're not
a flight risk.

01:12:45.053 --> 01:12:47.019
He decides?
Yeah, he's the boss.

01:12:47.053 --> 01:12:49.419
Dude, who put him in charge?

01:12:49.453 --> 01:12:50.753
I don't know, but he's the boss.

01:12:50.786 --> 01:12:52.519
Guy's a maniac.

01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:58.286
I mean that's ridiculous.

01:12:58.319 --> 01:13:01.286
How long do you think before
I can wrap all this up?

01:13:01.319 --> 01:13:02.386
I don't really know, sir.

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:04.286
I'm new here, too. Let's go.

01:13:06.286 --> 01:13:08.519
Take a seat.

01:13:13.053 --> 01:13:14.419
Oh god.

01:13:29.186 --> 01:13:31.386
Detective Sergeant Dante.

01:13:31.419 --> 01:13:33.153
Yeah, I‐‐ I know, I met you.

01:13:33.186 --> 01:13:35.053
Remember, you hate me?

01:13:35.086 --> 01:13:36.086
You met my twin brother.

01:13:36.119 --> 01:13:38.719
What, are you putting me
on, dude?

01:13:38.753 --> 01:13:44.386
You had quite an eventful night,
I understand, Mr. Harrelson.

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:46.053
No, no, hold on.

01:13:46.086 --> 01:13:47.586
What, did you just change
clothes and it's like...

01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:51.519
an interrogation technique
or something?

01:13:51.553 --> 01:13:53.519
What drugs did you imbibe
this evening?

01:13:53.553 --> 01:13:56.519
I‐‐ I don't‐‐ I don't do drugs.

01:13:56.553 --> 01:13:57.519
Ever.

01:13:57.553 --> 01:13:59.153
I, I, I'm straight edge...

01:13:59.186 --> 01:14:01.153
and I think it's a terrible
example for children.

01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:05.086
Hm, and yet you had cannabis
on your person.

01:14:05.119 --> 01:14:06.619
No, sir, I did not.

01:14:06.653 --> 01:14:08.519
Will you submit to a blood test?

01:14:11.286 --> 01:14:15.486
But I‐‐ I‐‐

01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:19.553
I don't, I don't...
um, do, er, needles.

01:14:19.586 --> 01:14:21.653
We use hair samples.

01:14:21.686 --> 01:14:23.653
No, I can't afford to lose
any more hair.

01:14:23.686 --> 01:14:24.786
I'm an actor, you know.

01:14:24.819 --> 01:14:31.353
Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with you
phoney, Hollywood types.

01:14:31.386 --> 01:14:32.519
You do drugs.

01:14:32.553 --> 01:14:35.219
You participate in orgies, eh?

01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:38.019
You take part in orgies?

01:14:38.053 --> 01:14:39.619
Yeah, course you do.

01:14:39.653 --> 01:14:43.119
And contribute to the
moral decay in our society.

01:14:43.153 --> 01:14:44.519
You don't get your way...

01:14:44.553 --> 01:14:47.586
you stamp your feet like
a little baby.

01:14:47.619 --> 01:14:51.553
Destroy your hotel room,
or your cab.

01:14:51.586 --> 01:14:54.086
You're thinking rock star.
I just make movies.

01:14:54.119 --> 01:14:55.519
Yeah, bad ones.

01:14:55.553 --> 01:14:58.353
'Money Train', what a joke.

01:14:58.386 --> 01:15:00.586
You will not be able to
leave here...

01:15:00.619 --> 01:15:03.153
until you've submitted to a
voluntary drug test.

01:15:03.186 --> 01:15:04.419
Okay, okay.

01:15:04.453 --> 01:15:08.219
First of all, that makes your
blood test far from voluntary.

01:15:08.253 --> 01:15:12.186
Secondly, I'm getting treated
like I butt raped Tony Blair...

01:15:12.219 --> 01:15:13.253
at the Queen's afternoon tea.

01:15:13.286 --> 01:15:15.986
And all I did was make
your brother's ashtray...

01:15:16.019 --> 01:15:17.619
In‐law.
In‐law, in‐law.

01:15:17.653 --> 01:15:21.019
Your brother‐in‐law's
useless ashtray useful...

01:15:21.053 --> 01:15:24.019
and for that I'm getting abused
by you and your twin brother.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:26.619
What are you guys? Bad cop,
worse cop?

01:15:26.653 --> 01:15:29.386
I mean, you know,
I'm an actor, okay.

01:15:29.419 --> 01:15:32.019
Voice and physicalisation are
my bread and butter...

01:15:32.053 --> 01:15:34.019
so I hate to rain on your
charade...

01:15:34.053 --> 01:15:37.219
but there's no way that you
guys are the same person.

01:15:37.253 --> 01:15:39.419
You're different people, because
you're the same person...

01:15:39.453 --> 01:15:43.253
and you're both abusing me
for breaking a broken ashtray.

01:15:43.286 --> 01:15:45.153
And I'm gonna call my Embassy,
dude.

01:15:50.033 --> 01:15:52.500
D'you, d'you think, d'you
think you're a tough guy?

01:15:52.533 --> 01:15:53.767
No, no, no.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.267
Are you the natural born killer
or am I the natural born killer?

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.100
Which one works for you?

01:15:59.133 --> 01:16:01.500
Are you the natural born killer
or am I the natural born killer?

01:16:01.533 --> 01:16:02.400
You, you, you‐‐
Me?

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:05.133
I'm the natural born killer!
Yes, yes!

01:16:06.367 --> 01:16:08.833
Thank you. That means a lot.

01:16:14.533 --> 01:16:19.033
Tell me, what's the most women
you've slept with in one go?

01:16:19.067 --> 01:16:20.467
Dude, I'm not answering that.

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.233
I hate you.

01:16:22.267 --> 01:16:24.233
What's it like to be with
three birds at once?

01:16:24.267 --> 01:16:25.367
Dude, I love my wife.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.900
Of course, but what man
would turn down three birds?

01:16:27.933 --> 01:16:29.567
I mean I wanna meet that guy.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.867
I don't wanna meet Tony Blair,
Stephen Hawking, Ted Danson...

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.833
but the man who turns down
three birds.

01:16:35.867 --> 01:16:39.400
I wanna meet him, buy him
a pint and ask him...

01:16:39.433 --> 01:16:42.000
"What's wrong with you?"

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.933
Sign this.

01:16:45.967 --> 01:16:48.467
What is it?
Your statement.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.300
Uh, responsible for all damages,
injuries, physical, emotion...

01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:55.467
Emotional? Dude, I'm not
signing this.

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.500
I‐‐ I don't have a pen.

01:16:59.533 --> 01:17:02.033
Just, okay.

01:17:02.067 --> 01:17:03.300
Right.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.967
Hmm... so easy.

01:17:12.467 --> 01:17:14.833
Can I ask you a favor?

01:17:14.867 --> 01:17:18.067
Now, tomorrow I'm taking my
kids to Leavesden Studios...

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.267
to meet Harry Potter, which
you're welcome to come.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.267
Hmm.
Yeah?

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.567
But I‐‐ we gotta leave here
by, I don't know, 6:45, 7:00...

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.867
because we've gotta be
there by 7:30 sharp.

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:34.167
So do you see any way, any way
at all that that could happen?

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.500
Yeah.
Yeah?

01:17:35.533 --> 01:17:36.967
Sure.
Really?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.233
Yeah.

01:17:38.267 --> 01:17:41.367
You just have to pick the lock
to your jail cell, kill me...

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.967
and sneak past all these other
coppers and out the front door.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.200
I mean other than a murderous
jail break, is it possible?

01:17:50.233 --> 01:17:54.033
No chance. I'm the natural
born killer.

01:18:12.867 --> 01:18:14.867
Come on, get up.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.433
What time is it?
It's 11:55.

01:18:17.467 --> 01:18:19.133
Time for you to make your call.

01:18:19.167 --> 01:18:21.300
Oh... okay.

01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:22.567
How'd it go?
Not good, man.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.967
I‐‐ I‐‐ I don't think
he's gonna let me go.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.233
Just make your call and let
me deal with him.

01:18:28.267 --> 01:18:29.300
Here.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.500
All right.

01:18:32.533 --> 01:18:34.933
Okay.

01:18:34.967 --> 01:18:40.900
Well, I mean, I don't have this
number memorized or anything.

01:18:40.933 --> 01:18:45.900
Well, I just‐‐
do you know how to‐‐

01:18:45.933 --> 01:18:47.900
Are you sure you don't have it?

01:18:47.933 --> 01:18:50.900
No, I don't have it memorized...
can you just‐‐

01:18:50.933 --> 01:18:52.033
Let me see.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.100
Eh... Sloane Hotel.

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:00.067
Sloane Hotel, please.

01:19:01.433 --> 01:19:03.367
Here, it's ringing.

01:19:05.967 --> 01:19:10.267
Yeah, er... oh, hello, hello.

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.567
Hi, er, this is‐‐

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.200
Can you connect me with
Woodrow Wilson? Yeah.

01:19:17.233 --> 01:19:19.467
Thank you.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.233
It's my pseudonym.

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:29.200
Yeah, hi, hi, uh, yeah...
it's just ringing.

01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:32.367
Hi, yeah. Hello?

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.367
- It's ringing.
- It's quite late.

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.933
Just keeps ringing and ringing.

01:19:36.967 --> 01:19:40.867
No answer?
Hello? Hi.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.133
Just ringing.
Maybe she's asleep.

01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:46.367
Oh my god, hello?

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.033
Are you on the phone?
Yeah, yeah, hi.

01:19:50.067 --> 01:19:52.033
Just one second, sir.
Sorry, sorry.

01:19:52.067 --> 01:19:55.967
It's just... yeah, can you,
er, can you ring the room again?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.233
Yeah, just ring it one
more time.

01:20:00.267 --> 01:20:04.233
It's ringing.
It's quite late.

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:06.067
Ring, ring.

01:20:09.467 --> 01:20:11.967
Just, I don't know why she
isn't picking up, man.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.467
Maybe she's sleeping.
Unlucky.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.067
Take him to his cell.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.800
No... can you just, just
one second.

01:20:18.933 --> 01:20:21.433
Hello? Hang on. Yeah, hello.

01:20:21.467 --> 01:20:25.433
Listen, will... ring it
one more time, will you?

01:20:25.467 --> 01:20:29.267
No, dude, I‐‐ I‐‐
I can't call back.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.400
No, I‐‐ I can't, because this
is my only call.

01:20:33.267 --> 01:20:37.367
Because I'm in jail, so would
you just please ring the room‐‐

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.300
Hello?

01:20:40.333 --> 01:20:41.400
Alas.

01:20:41.433 --> 01:20:44.500
What the hell? Why are people
hanging up on me today?

01:20:44.533 --> 01:20:46.033
Unlucky.

01:20:46.067 --> 01:20:47.567
Sir, maybe if we...

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.167
Can, can I just call her cell?
You had your call.

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.400
Just let me call her cell.
You had your call.

01:20:52.433 --> 01:20:53.633
Well that's not fair, man.

01:20:53.667 --> 01:20:56.033
Sir, if we mention that we're,
we're the police, then maybe...

01:20:56.067 --> 01:20:57.400
Take him, Paddy.

01:20:57.433 --> 01:20:59.000
No, please, please, just let
me...

01:20:59.033 --> 01:21:00.567
Let's go, sir. Come on.
Take him.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:04.900
Come on, let's go, now, now.

01:21:04.933 --> 01:21:06.933
Can I ask a favor, man?
There's nothing I can do.

01:21:06.967 --> 01:21:08.167
This is my first day.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.267
Dude, do you have a pen
and paper?

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.900
There's only so much I can
help with, I'm new here.

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:12.333
Please, do you have a pen
and paper?

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.167
Here.
Okay, look.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.167
I want you to just call
this number, right?

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:22.500
And my wife will come and,
and, and save me, okay?

01:21:22.533 --> 01:21:24.267
So just please do this...

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.267
because my kids are gonna meet
Harry Potter in the morning.

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.267
It's gonna be the biggest
day of their lives.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.367
And I beg you, please,
please to do‐‐

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.900
You, you, you have any kids?

01:21:33.433 --> 01:21:34.867
Yeah.

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:37.833
What?
What?

01:21:37.867 --> 01:21:38.833
What?

01:21:38.867 --> 01:21:40.067
I just told you about my
son eleven minutes ago.

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.567
Were you listening, you fake?
Feigning interest in my kid.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.933
"Maybe our kids could
play together."

01:21:43.967 --> 01:21:45.167
Oh, no.
You're a fraud.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.267
Oh I am so sorry, dude, I'm so‐‐

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:47.567
Don't try and nuzzle up to
me, you two‐faced creep.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.167
I don't talk about me son
to anyone.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.300
That's cre‐‐ you're creepy.
No.

01:21:50.333 --> 01:21:52.233
No, no, I'm not creepy, man‐‐
You are, you're creepy.

01:21:52.267 --> 01:21:54.033
You two‐faced, stoner,
Hollywood creep, let's go.

01:21:54.067 --> 01:21:56.133
But, but my, my kids are
not creepy.

01:21:56.167 --> 01:21:58.000
They're the most uncreepy
kids in the world.

01:21:58.033 --> 01:21:59.433
They deserve to meet
Harry Potter.

01:21:59.467 --> 01:22:01.267
Yeah, well, my kid deserves
to meet Harry Potter, too.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:03.333
Well, bring him and they
can meet, and all of them...

01:22:03.367 --> 01:22:06.133
can meet Bumbledore and, and
Harry Potter, and, and Her H...

01:22:06.167 --> 01:22:08.400
Look, dude, dude, I‐‐ I‐‐
I'm sorry, okay?

01:22:08.433 --> 01:22:09.533
Yeah, you look it, let's go.

01:22:09.567 --> 01:22:11.900
No, I mean, I'm‐‐ I'm a lousy
excuse for a human being.

01:22:11.933 --> 01:22:13.133
Well, I couldn't have summed
it up better myself.

01:22:13.167 --> 01:22:14.933
I never graduated
from adolescence.

01:22:14.967 --> 01:22:17.933
I'm like perpetually, you know
and I‐‐ I get high all the time.

01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:19.300
And I get drunk all the time.

01:22:19.333 --> 01:22:20.467
And I'm filling my senses...

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:23.033
and my heart is withering
in my chest.

01:22:23.067 --> 01:22:27.300
And‐‐ and my wife is the
most incredible person...

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:28.533
on this earth and I‐‐

01:22:28.567 --> 01:22:31.367
Dude, she's, she's gonna
leave me.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.933
And when she leaves me,
I'm gonna...

01:22:32.967 --> 01:22:36.233
I'm gonna break up with
myself, man.

01:22:36.267 --> 01:22:39.033
I‐‐ I‐‐ look I was,
I was manipulating you earlier.

01:22:39.067 --> 01:22:40.533
I was trying to curry favor...

01:22:40.567 --> 01:22:43.300
pretend that I cared about your
son, hoping you'd help me.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.133
But I don't blame you if
you don't forgive me.

01:22:45.167 --> 01:22:48.867
I mean, I've‐‐ I've actually
grown unsympathetic to myself.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:52.000
But I, I, I would love to take
you and your son to meet...

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:54.233
Harry Potter tomorrow if, if‐‐

01:22:56.567 --> 01:23:00.067
You can believe that, man,
even if my family can't come.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.100
You'd take me and my son
with you to see Harry Potter?

01:23:03.133 --> 01:23:05.100
Even if your family didn't come?

01:23:05.133 --> 01:23:06.400
Yeah. Yeah, I...

01:23:06.433 --> 01:23:09.100
You could be manipulating
me now.

01:23:09.133 --> 01:23:11.100
But I'm not asking you
for anything.

01:23:11.133 --> 01:23:14.033
Neither am I.
Come on, let's go.

01:23:14.067 --> 01:23:17.900
Yeah, but...
Come on, go, let's go, get in.

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:24.167
Pad, Paddy?

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.100
Yeah?

01:23:27.133 --> 01:23:29.800
Thanks, man.
For what?

01:23:29.833 --> 01:23:33.433
You're a good man.
Goodnight.

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:36.533
I think that's yours.
Oh, thank you.

01:24:00.567 --> 01:24:01.933
God.

01:24:05.433 --> 01:24:07.200
Stupid!

01:24:07.233 --> 01:24:10.133
Stupid, stupid, stupid...

01:24:10.167 --> 01:24:16.233
stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid!

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:51.933
God, it's been a while...

01:24:51.967 --> 01:24:54.467
and I haven't been a very
good Christian.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:25:01.467
I know, I guess I got lost
in the carnival and I just...

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.867
I don't know if you're
up there, God...

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:09.033
but if you are, this is it, man.

01:25:09.067 --> 01:25:14.433
I mean, my wife and my, my
best friend on the same day.

01:25:14.467 --> 01:25:19.967
I mean, even Job had a week
to adjust, I mean, God...

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.967
please, please, God,
don't let me lose her.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.333
Please give me another chance.
Please, God. Please.

01:25:31.367 --> 01:25:34.233
Please, please, God.

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:39.067

Willie, what's going on?

01:26:55.006 --> 01:26:57.873
Everything at once, man,
it's freaking me out.

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.706
They let you in here?

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.906
Yeah, I'm feeling it's a lot
easier to get in one of these...

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.106
places than it is to get
out of 'em.

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.540
How are you doing?
Terrible, man.

01:27:08.573 --> 01:27:10.106
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:12.973
My old lady used to say,
"Don't worry about a thing...

01:27:13.006 --> 01:27:16.106
"'cause there ain't nothing
gonna be all right".

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:20.006
Oh, man, I just, I messed
up real bad.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.773
Well, you just did what
other men have done.

01:27:22.806 --> 01:27:23.773
I've done it myself.

01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:27.506
Yeah, but you've had like
129 wives, Willie.

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.540
I just want one, I want Laura.

01:27:29.573 --> 01:27:31.540
Well, what do you think
women want?

01:27:31.573 --> 01:27:35.806
Well, I don't know... love.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.706
Love, honesty, respect, loyalty.

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.806
Oh, yeah, well I should
have thought of those.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.473
Those are the hard ones.

01:27:43.506 --> 01:27:46.473
Yeah, well, this ain't about
what you're going through.

01:27:46.506 --> 01:27:48.073
This is about what
Laura's going through.

01:27:48.106 --> 01:27:49.173
That's what you gotta
think about.

01:27:49.206 --> 01:27:53.906
Grow a spine. If you're gonna
be a bear, be a grizzly.

01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:56.506
Oh, well that, that is
good advice, Willie.

01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.140
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.606
Uh, did you miss me?

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.773
Huh. You're the best,
Willie. I so appreciate you.

01:28:05.806 --> 01:28:08.640
Hey, I'm gonna put in a good
word for you...

01:28:08.673 --> 01:28:11.906
'cause you know, I always liked
you just a little bit.

01:28:13.673 --> 01:28:17.106
Thank you, Willie,
thank you so much.

01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:19.440
You're as welcome as the
flowers in spring.

01:28:19.473 --> 01:28:22.640
And if you ever need
a friend, buy a dog.

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:27.706
You're the Texas Dalai Lama,
man.

01:29:23.106 --> 01:29:27.673
Wake up, buttercup. Carpe diem.

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:31.106
O?

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:33.440
It's me, buddy.

01:29:33.473 --> 01:29:36.040
Oh, did you see Willie?

01:29:36.073 --> 01:29:38.006
Willie's on Maui, amigo.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:41.806
Ah, man, well I dreamed
he was here.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.640
Am I dreaming you're here?

01:29:44.673 --> 01:29:46.640
No, I'm here, I just paid
your bail.

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:48.773
Oh, thanks, buddy.

01:29:48.806 --> 01:29:50.073
Don't thank me, thank Paddy.

01:29:50.106 --> 01:29:53.073
Thank you so much, Paddy.
No worries.

01:29:53.106 --> 01:29:54.506
What time is it?

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:56.006
It's time to go meet
Harry Potter.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.106
Oh, yes! Yes!

01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:02.506
Okay, so, er, you called Laura?
Called Laura.

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.806
- Then Laura called you?
- Yeah.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:08.640
And, so, Laura saved me, huh?

01:30:08.673 --> 01:30:12.673
Yeah. Laura saved me.

01:30:12.706 --> 01:30:14.640
Sorry about that fight.

01:30:14.673 --> 01:30:16.540
Oh, me, too, bro.

01:30:16.573 --> 01:30:20.606
Oh, gosh, I gotta say,
you are quite the scrapper.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.540
Yeah, you did run into a little
bit of a buzz saw tonight.

01:30:25.573 --> 01:30:26.806
Yeah.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:30.673
You're lucky‐‐ you're lucky they
pulled me off you when they did.

01:30:30.706 --> 01:30:31.840
Well, you know, I was just...

01:30:31.873 --> 01:30:33.106
I was getting ready
to crank it up.

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.140
pretending to lose consciousness
I was about to stage a comeback.

01:30:36.173 --> 01:30:39.073
I could feel that,
playing possum.

01:30:39.106 --> 01:30:42.906
I could also feel that Vulcan
death grip that you did...

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:46.440
on my head that just left
me feeling a little concussed.

01:30:46.473 --> 01:30:48.406
Dude, tell me I didn't
hurt your moneymaker.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.673
I mean, now that's the
main thing.

01:30:49.706 --> 01:30:51.473
No, it's okay.

01:30:51.506 --> 01:30:54.140
I mean, is that cheeky‐boy
smile still there, right?

01:30:54.173 --> 01:30:56.140
Please, let's never lose that.

01:30:56.173 --> 01:30:57.740
Oh, my god.

01:30:57.773 --> 01:30:59.506
Come and meet me son.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.606
Let's go.
Yeah, okay.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:05.106
You know, you did actually a
pretty good, um, 'Larry Flynt'.

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.506
Oh... come on.

01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:09.540
Now your free.

01:31:09.573 --> 01:31:12.740
Free at last! Free at last!

01:31:21.406 --> 01:31:22.806
Where's Laura and the kids?

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:26.640
They're not here.

01:31:26.673 --> 01:31:29.806
What do you mean? I thought
they were gonna be here.

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.373
I don't know.

01:31:31.406 --> 01:31:34.873
Hold it, but you talked to her
on the phone, right?

01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:37.473
She called me and asked me
to call Paddy...

01:31:37.506 --> 01:31:38.740
and come bail you out.

01:31:38.773 --> 01:31:44.006
But, well, so... you don't
know where she is?

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.440
No idea.

01:31:50.806 --> 01:31:52.873
Sorry.

01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.973
Hold on, so where's,
where's your son?

01:32:39.006 --> 01:32:41.406
Well, we're going to
collect him.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.706
You still wanna go, yeah,
see Harry Potter?

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:47.640
Yeah, I mean, we might
as well.

01:32:47.673 --> 01:32:50.940
Be good to, at least for us
to see Harry Potter.

01:32:50.973 --> 01:32:53.573
Well, you guys, I'm gonna have
to take a rain check, I think.

01:32:53.606 --> 01:32:55.806
You guys can drop me off
on the way.

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.006
What do you mean?
What are you doing?

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.073
I got that meeting
I gotta go to.

01:33:01.106 --> 01:33:03.706
What, at this hour
of the morning?

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.673
Morning meeting.

01:33:06.706 --> 01:33:08.006
Well, with who?

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.940
It's not important.

01:33:09.973 --> 01:33:12.640
Dude, who‐‐ who are you meeting?

01:33:14.006 --> 01:33:15.473
Wes.

01:33:15.506 --> 01:33:17.940
Wes?

01:33:17.973 --> 01:33:19.840
Your best friend?

01:33:21.806 --> 01:33:24.906
Yeah, Wes, my best friend...
and guess what?

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:29.373
I have three brothers,
Andrew, Luke and Woody.

01:33:29.406 --> 01:33:32.840
I feel like I just got demoted
from second best friend...

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:36.606
to third favorite brother...
god.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.606
Hits just keep on coming, man.

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.640
Come on.

01:33:44.673 --> 01:33:46.840
You want me to tell Wes
you said hello?

01:33:46.873 --> 01:33:49.540
Yeah, yeah, you know,
I actually do like him.

01:33:49.573 --> 01:33:51.006
You guys get along.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.873
I'm just jealous, because he
never called me for anything.

01:33:58.473 --> 01:34:01.973
Hey, what was that thing you
were saying was the...

01:34:02.006 --> 01:34:07.373
talking about the beautiful
thing that me and Laura had?

01:34:07.406 --> 01:34:09.740
In the club?
Yeah.

01:34:09.773 --> 01:34:12.873
Oh, I was kind of just...

01:34:12.906 --> 01:34:16.340
scrambling a little bit,
but I mean‐‐

01:34:18.773 --> 01:34:20.573
What's going on?

01:34:20.606 --> 01:34:23.673
Can a police car pull
over another police car?

01:34:23.706 --> 01:34:24.940
It's a bit strange, all right.

01:34:24.973 --> 01:34:27.373
Well that doesn't make
any sense.

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.473
Find out who it is.

01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:39.906
But it doesn't surprise me, man.

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.806
The way things are going,
this, this night is, er...

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.440
just never gonna stop.

01:34:45.673 --> 01:34:47.873
License and registration?

01:34:47.906 --> 01:34:51.540
Dante... what's going on, man?

01:34:51.573 --> 01:34:54.973
You don't think I was gonna
miss Harry Potter, do you?

01:34:55.006 --> 01:34:57.706
Sign this.
Oh, great, great.

01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:59.840
Wow, just great.

01:35:02.006 --> 01:35:04.740
And, er, we might have a
few surprise guests.

01:35:08.073 --> 01:35:10.673
Daddy!
Kids!

01:35:10.706 --> 01:35:13.440
Ah!

01:35:13.473 --> 01:35:15.540
Why didn't you come home
last night?

01:35:15.573 --> 01:35:16.906
Where were you?

01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:18.573
Oh, well, okay, I'm gonna...

01:35:18.606 --> 01:35:21.506
er, I'm gonna explain
it all to you, okay?

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:25.006
Um, you got any jokes for me?
Uh, yeah.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:28.106
When you go into the
bathroom, you're American.

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.006
When you come out of
the bathroom, you're American.

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.806
What are you when you're
in the bathroom?

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.006
Ah, I give up.

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.473
You're a peein'.

01:35:35.506 --> 01:35:39.473
Okay, there was this zoo with
no animals and just one dog.

01:35:39.506 --> 01:35:41.640
It was a Shitzu.
I don't get it.

01:35:41.673 --> 01:35:43.806
Woody, this is Billy.
Dumb joke.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.140
Say hello, Billy... who's that?
Billy!

01:35:45.173 --> 01:35:47.140
Hello, Billy.
Who's this?

01:35:47.173 --> 01:35:48.906
What you got here?
Harry Potter.

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.540
Harry Potter.

01:35:50.573 --> 01:35:52.040
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

01:35:52.073 --> 01:35:53.240
Put me down.
I'm gonna give you a minute.

01:35:53.273 --> 01:35:57.540
Let's go, kids... I'll give you
a minute, come on, let's go!

01:35:57.573 --> 01:35:59.506
Let's go and see
Harry Potter!

01:36:09.006 --> 01:36:11.440
I thought you left me.

01:36:11.473 --> 01:36:13.140
I did leave you.

01:36:13.173 --> 01:36:15.006
But the sins of the father...

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.473
don't need to be visited
on his children.

01:36:17.506 --> 01:36:20.040
They really wanna meet
Harry Potter.

01:36:20.073 --> 01:36:23.840
So that's the reason
you're here?

01:36:23.873 --> 01:36:25.840
Mostly.

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:30.040
I've been doing a lot
of thinking.

01:36:30.073 --> 01:36:31.973
Yeah, so have I.

01:36:32.006 --> 01:36:38.006
And, er, I know I cause you a
lot of pain and humiliation.

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:41.673
You do not make it easy, Woody.

01:36:41.706 --> 01:36:44.006
And I, I, I can't...

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:48.640
I tell you you're, you're the
most amazing woman in the world.

01:36:48.673 --> 01:36:50.073
And you're‐‐ you're the
one for me.

01:36:50.106 --> 01:36:53.873
Just not the only.

01:36:53.906 --> 01:36:58.706
I can't imagine this, your, my
world without you, I can't.

01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:04.540
But... I think if I'm really
gonna be selfless about this...

01:37:04.573 --> 01:37:07.140
I don't wanna see you
saddled with me...

01:37:07.173 --> 01:37:11.573
cuz I don't wanna see the person
I love with the person I hate.

01:37:11.606 --> 01:37:16.473
And I, I know that the best
thing that I can do for you...

01:37:16.506 --> 01:37:18.873
and the only way I can
truly love you...

01:37:18.906 --> 01:37:23.040
is to help you get rid of me.

01:37:23.073 --> 01:37:30.406
So I want you to go, in
that van, and leave me here.

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:33.773
At least then I'll know
you'll be all right, honey.

01:37:57.573 --> 01:38:00.040
No! No, no!
No! No! No!

01:38:06.192 --> 01:38:07.928
Woody?!
Papa!

01:38:09.961 --> 01:38:12.061
How's it going down
there, jail bird?

01:38:12.094 --> 01:38:13.528
It's been better.

01:38:13.561 --> 01:38:14.528
Come on, Woods.

01:38:14.561 --> 01:38:17.561
Get him up, kids.
Let's get him in the van.

01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:24.594
You know, Woodrow, you're
not quite rid of us.

01:38:26.628 --> 01:38:28.794
Does that mean you're not
gonna leave me?

01:38:28.828 --> 01:38:30.528
Not yet.

01:38:30.561 --> 01:38:32.828
Let's just see how the day goes.

01:38:43.861 --> 01:38:45.561
Hello, Billy.

01:38:45.594 --> 01:38:46.694
- Hey, guys.
- Say, "Hi, Woody".

01:38:46.728 --> 01:38:48.994
Hi, Woody.

01:38:49.028 --> 01:38:50.861
Harry Potter.

01:38:50.894 --> 01:38:53.094
Harry Potter!

01:38:53.128 --> 01:38:55.128
Yeah!

01:39:36.161 --> 01:39:38.861
So I remember when Woody and
his family visited...

01:39:38.894 --> 01:39:42.094
the Harry Potter set on, I
believe it was the second film.

01:39:42.128 --> 01:39:44.128
Um, so I was about 12 or 13.

01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:48.794
And, er, whenever sort of famous
people or actors came out...

01:39:48.828 --> 01:39:50.794
to the set, you know, it was
very exciting.

01:39:50.828 --> 01:39:53.094
So the crew, everyone was very
excited, I was very excited.

01:39:53.128 --> 01:39:57.394
Er, and, and I met him and
he was, they were all lovely.

01:39:57.428 --> 01:39:59.961
Um, and then later that day...

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:04.861
sort of news started filtering
through about some weirdness...

01:40:04.894 --> 01:40:07.828
altercation with a taxi the
previous night.

01:40:07.861 --> 01:40:10.994
And the genuine reaction
around the set was...

01:40:11.028 --> 01:40:14.694
"Did Woody Harrelson just come
and use the Harry Potter set...

01:40:14.728 --> 01:40:16.928
"as a safe house for a day?"

01:40:16.961 --> 01:40:19.394
"And was he just like
coming here to hide out?".

01:40:19.428 --> 01:40:22.528
Um, which it turns out wasn't
the case, but if it had been...

01:40:22.561 --> 01:40:25.628
it would have been a pretty
cool thing to do.

01:40:25.661 --> 01:40:30.994
Um, so, yeah, er, that was, that
was the first time I met Woody.
