02:07.640 --> 02:08.868
Hi, Peggy.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.192
We just came by to borrow
some lawn chairs.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.511
Jefferson's taking me to the beach.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.079
The beach, huh?

02:18.320 --> 02:21.232
Gee, I can't remember the last time
Al took me to the beach.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.119
Can't remember
the last time Al took me.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.637
- Sure as hell wasn't at the beach.
- Oh, Peggy.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.032
It's such a shame you didn't marry
into your own species.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.758
Vertebrates love to go places
with their wives.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.679
- Take Jefferson.
- Like you wouldn't want him back.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.553
For example, I meant.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.394
In the book that I got him,
The Woman Is Always Right...

02:50.880 --> 02:54.429
...Jefferson has learned the ABC's
of any good marriage are...

02:54.680 --> 02:58.070
Appreciation, balance
and consideration.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.393
Well, you know, Al believes
in the ABC's of a good marriage too.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.234
Only his are air conditioning, beer...

03:05.440 --> 03:09.319
...and " Could you shut up so I can
enjoy my air conditioning and beer?"

03:18.240 --> 03:21.391
Come on, Marcie,
your stuff's in the garage.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.031
Al, how come you never take me
to the beach?

03:25.640 --> 03:28.200
What's the point?
You'd just find your way back.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.236
I really wish
you two were coming with us.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.755
I hate seeing Al shirtless
as much as anyone...

03:36.000 --> 03:39.276
...but there's no better way
to keep the flies off the food.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.477
On the bright side,
there's no lifeguard...

03:45.680 --> 03:49.070
...that would give her
mouth-to-beak resuscitation.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.268
Hey, guess what happened to me today
at the shoe store.

03:52.520 --> 03:56.195
A cop came in,
gave you a ticket for loitering?

03:56.720 --> 03:59.518
So no friends at all
are enough for you now?

04:00.480 --> 04:03.358
- I'm sorry, Al. Go ahead.
- Okay.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.879
Jefferson, was there ever a girl
in your life...

04:07.120 --> 04:11.511
...that you were so nuts about, so crazy
for, so unbelievably in love with...

04:11.760 --> 04:13.716
...that you would do anything
she asked you?

04:14.320 --> 04:17.039
Yes, Marcie.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.755
Really?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.958
Yep. Marcie McGuire,
my third grade teacher.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.510
I remember she used to wear
this certain skirt...

04:26.760 --> 04:30.673
...and sometimes if there was a lot
of static electricity in the air it would...

04:30.920 --> 04:33.559
Jefferson, this is my story.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.352
What would it do?

04:40.040 --> 04:42.110
Cling to her bottom.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.314
Anyway, there I was
in the shoe store...

04:48.560 --> 04:49.959
...and guess who I heard from?

04:50.200 --> 04:52.111
Mary Ellen Listfield.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.396
My Marcie McGuire.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.829
You should've seen her.

04:56.040 --> 05:00.318
She was the most beautiful girl in
the neighbourhood. I was so in love.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.794
So...

05:03.160 --> 05:04.957
...did you do her?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.953
You're a toad,
you know that, Jefferson?

05:09.200 --> 05:13.239
Why would I say I was in love with her
if I ever had sex with her?

05:20.360 --> 05:22.920
Good point, Al. You're right.
So go ahead. What happened?

05:23.160 --> 05:25.958
Well, she went off to college...

05:26.200 --> 05:29.875
...but before she went I told her
if she ever needed anything to call.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.430
- And today she did.
- So now you're gonna do her.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.596
My doing days are over, Jefferson.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.189
I'm done.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.514
But get this.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.757
She's back in the neighbourhood
running her father's old soda shop.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.838
Now, a few kids in the neighbourhood
are giving her a bad time.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.275
So I'm gonna go
straighten things out.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.274
- What're you gonna tell Peggy?
- Same thing I've told her my whole life.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.992
That what I do
is none of her damn business!

06:14.520 --> 06:16.715
Al, Al, Al.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.956
Have you ever read the book:

06:19.200 --> 06:20.997
The Man Is Always Right?

06:22.160 --> 06:24.515
No. Wife wouldn't let me.

06:25.240 --> 06:29.313
Well, in the chapter titled,
"My God, Is She Still Here?"...

06:31.760 --> 06:34.354
...it states that the longer
a couple has been married...

06:34.600 --> 06:37.239
...the less likely a man
can hide anything from his wife.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.438
There hasn't been a woman made yet
smart enough to read Al Bundy.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.878
Hi, Peg.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.516
What're you hiding?

06:48.720 --> 06:52.395
- I was at the shoe store today when...
- When, when...

06:52.600 --> 06:54.795
...when he realized
that he hasn't taken you...

06:55.040 --> 06:57.634
...on that second honeymoon
that you've always dreamed of.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.398
And now he is.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.192
- Now I am?
- Oh, Al, you are?

07:03.440 --> 07:07.797
- You really do care.
- But Peg, I don't. I swear that I don't.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.508
I gotta go tell Marcie.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.635
Okay, I know what you're thinking.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.913
Then why aren't you
crossing your legs?

07:32.280 --> 07:33.872
Look, Al, don't you get it?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.270
Now she can't suspect anything.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.354
All you do is you just go get
a hotel near the old neighbourhood...

07:40.560 --> 07:46.715
...and after you take care of business,
then you can go take care of business.

07:46.960 --> 07:51.033
But that means
I have to sex with my wife.

07:51.280 --> 07:56.115
Hey. Sometimes if you wanna win
the war you have to burn the village.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.835
Al, this is so exciting.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.638
Look at this room.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.632
Look at this bed.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.269
And it's even made.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.512
Our second honeymoon.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.548
Just you and me together
for the whole weekend.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.432
Gee, Al, I wish
you could feel my heart.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.473
I wish I could feel your throat.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.797
But enough foreplay.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.510
This is our honeymoon and I say we
shouldn't waste another minute of it.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.149
Oh, baby.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.155
Well, I haven't seen you like this
since Ginger week on Gilligan's Island.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.714
So, what'd you have in mind?

08:50.960 --> 08:52.552
First we get out of these clothes...

08:52.760 --> 08:57.276
...and then start things off
with a good, long, hard nap.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.277
- Nap?
- Yes, Peg. Just you and me.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.752
- Or better yet, just you.
- But, Al, I wanted to fool around.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.834
Oh, Peg, that'd be just like
our first honeymoon.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.118
Well, not if we fool around together.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.395
- Just a quickie, Al.
- Peg.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.758
Please, just a quickie. I promise.
And then I'll go right to sleep.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.352
Oh, all right.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.672
But make it quick
because I'm not in the mood...

09:54.640 --> 09:58.872
- Hey, buddy, can you help me out?
- No, sorry, I already gave at the wife.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.994
I'm here to see Mary Ellen.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.639
Oh, she's upstairs.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.631
- Hey, aren't you Al Bundy?
- Himself.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.716
- How'd you know?
- Everybody knows you, Mr. Bundy.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.836
That's the thing about coming home,
they never forget you.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.030
Say, little girl, you look familiar.

10:44.280 --> 10:48.159
You wouldn't happen to be
Mary Ellen's daughter, by any chance?

10:48.400 --> 10:51.233
Me? No. I'm Jackie, her niece.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.119
Yes! I knew it.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.715
My dream girl's still untouched.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.837
All Aunt Mary's kids are grown.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.432
Oh, well, what did you expect...

11:02.680 --> 11:05.513
...the same little virgin
you used to walk to school?

11:05.760 --> 11:09.799
So someone else touched her,
what difference does it mak e?

11:10.240 --> 11:12.549
Damn slut.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.319
- Hi, Al.
- Oh, Mary Ellen.

11:16.560 --> 11:20.599
Well, you don't look like a slut at all.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.592
Thanks, Al.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.308
You're not exactly
a sack of road apples yourself.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.589
Well, I try to keep in shape.

11:31.840 --> 11:35.628
- It's been a long time, Al.
- Yeah, it sure has.

11:38.160 --> 11:43.109
Hey, congratulations. Jackie tells me
you had some sex. I mean, some kids.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.840
Yeah. Three, actually. How about you?

11:47.080 --> 11:50.470
No sex. Two kids.
Three dollars. Not on me.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.109
Oh, but listen. I gotta be honest.
I can't stay long.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.710
The wife thinks I'm in the bathroom,
so I can only stay a couple of hours.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.629
Hey, you wanna tell me about
those kids who've been hassling you?

12:00.840 --> 12:06.472
Well, the main one's name is Ray Ray
and he's not a bad kid, actually.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.439
In a lot of ways he reminds me
of the way you were.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.240
I don't wanna get him in trouble,
Al, I just figured...

12:12.480 --> 12:14.596
...with you guys
being so similar that...

12:16.000 --> 12:17.831
Here he comes.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.911
What, this little punk?

12:20.160 --> 12:21.673
What's so similar about us?

12:30.320 --> 12:33.915
Hey, give me a couple
of steak and egg sandwiches, huh?

12:34.160 --> 12:37.914
In my day, when two people were
talking, a man would wait his turn.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.516
Yeah, well, in your day
there only were two people.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.390
Now give me a couple
of steak and egg sandwiches.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.835
You never paid for the ones
you had last night.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.071
That's why I said "Give me."

13:03.760 --> 13:05.352
Do I know you, man?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.636
Ever hear of Al Bundy?

13:07.880 --> 13:09.359
Polk High. All City.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.034
Four touchdowns in one game.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.509
- No.
- Hey, wait a minute, Ray Ray.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.194
It's that bad check guy.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.477
Oh, yeah. Al Bundy.
Hey, what is up, Al?

13:24.720 --> 13:28.030
I was king of these streets before
you were the gleam in the eyes...

13:28.240 --> 13:31.755
...of a couple of strangers
at an Eagles concert.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.913
And that lady you've been picking on
is a friend of mine.

13:36.160 --> 13:41.792
So as the former king of the streets
to a pretender to the throne...

13:42.040 --> 13:44.076
...we can handle this two ways:

13:44.320 --> 13:46.151
Either in here like gentlemen...

13:46.400 --> 13:49.312
...or out there like Ren and Stimpy.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.873
The choice is up to you.

14:05.360 --> 14:09.717
Begging your highnesses pardon,
but if I may suggest a third option.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.431
Al, are you okay?

14:17.680 --> 14:20.990
You've been in there
for almost two hours.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.233
Do you need any...

14:24.480 --> 14:25.959
...help?

14:29.800 --> 14:31.950
Nope. I'm fine.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.439
Just savouring the moment.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.273
- AI, what happened?
- Cut myself shaving.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.551
Hey, Peg...

14:52.280 --> 14:54.919
...I was king of the streets once,
wasn't I?

14:55.160 --> 14:58.232
Of course you were king
of the streets once, honey.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.438
You and your boys. You remember.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.113
Crazy Andy Goozick.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.237
Pete "The Beat" Rombalo.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.994
Tony "The Tongue" McCullough.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.559
Wait a second, Peg.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.872
I never knew anyone named
Tony the Tongue.

15:18.120 --> 15:22.238
Well, I guess he must have been
one of my boys.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.676
Yeah, my boys.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.911
That's what I need. My boys.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.037
Oh, no, you don't, Al.

15:33.280 --> 15:37.114
- You can do this all by yourself.
- Do what, Peg?

15:49.480 --> 15:51.675
Yo, Ray Ray.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.991
Okay, punk.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.795
- You okay, Skippy?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.758
Good.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.874
What, do you got doughnuts
in that thing?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.478
We walked from the car, okay?

16:24.520 --> 16:25.873
As I was saying...

16:26.080 --> 16:27.957
...now that the odds
are a little fairer...

16:28.200 --> 16:30.430
...let's re-examine your options.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.795
What, are we supposed to be scared?

16:43.520 --> 16:47.274
Well, let me tell you something
about the king and his court.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.077
Well, this certainly sucks.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.877
But it's no time to panic.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.999
If you're still the king
just say what a king would say.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.198
Can't we all just get along?

17:27.960 --> 17:30.428
Oh, please let her be asleep.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.597
Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.312
Thank you.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.919
Al.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.834
Peg...

17:51.040 --> 17:54.555
...can't we all just get along?

18:14.920 --> 18:16.148
Well, well, well.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.756
Kud. Belly.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.030
What are you four doing here?

18:25.520 --> 18:28.353
Daddy, we know what you've
been doing. It's all over town.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.518
That I've been having sex
with my wife? No, I'm ruined.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.629
Not that, eggplant.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.913
We're talking about fighting
in the street with Ray Ray's boys.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.720
Daddy, this is Chicago. 1990's.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.157
This is not some gunfight
at the "Okey" Corral.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.112
O.K.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.994
Yeah, I'm all right,
I'm just a little pissed.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.554
Now, kids,
I appreciate your concern...

18:55.800 --> 18:58.712
...but I have given my word
to a very dear old friend.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.873
And as soon as I can remember
her name and where she lives...

19:03.120 --> 19:05.156
...l'm going back there.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.871
Have I gone yet?

19:09.320 --> 19:13.108
- No, Dad.
- Well, then give me a push.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.474
Now help me up.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.232
Yo, Ray.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.792
What is it with you, Bundy?

19:31.040 --> 19:34.032
You still not getting enough curb
in your diet?

19:34.360 --> 19:38.273
I mean, we knock you around,
you come back.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.590
Why? Why do you do it?

19:41.880 --> 19:44.348
For the same reason
men climb mountains...

19:44.600 --> 19:47.273
...or sail across the sea alone.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.911
For the only reason that a rational man
would do an irrational thing like this.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.354
Pride.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.556
No. Women.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.679
I'm a moron, Ray Ray.

20:00.720 --> 20:04.315
We're all morons.
That's what comes from being a man.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.438
From the first little worm
they dare us to eat...

20:07.680 --> 20:11.673
...to the last big shovelful of snow
they convince us we can move.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.512
We're nothing more to women...

20:13.720 --> 20:16.473
...than an amusement park ride
with life insurance.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.155
Why else would we do
the idiotic things that we do?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.799
For example:

20:26.320 --> 20:28.550
- You ski?
- No.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.436
Well, you will someday if a girl
wants you to. We all will.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.551
We'd hurdle down
that mountain so fast...

20:34.760 --> 20:37.035
...that the crack of our bodies
hitting the tree...

20:37.240 --> 20:41.028
...wouldn't even resonate before
we'd pounce up and say, "I'm okay."

20:41.320 --> 20:43.072
They know we're not okay.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.311
Even if they missed
that pair of squirrels...

20:45.520 --> 20:47.750
...running away
with our hacky sacks...

20:48.000 --> 20:51.913
...one glance at the colour of the snow
would hint there might be some trauma.

20:53.320 --> 20:57.074
We've all been to a weight room when
a girl walks by and said to ourselves:

20:57.280 --> 21:01.910
"Gee, I think I'll start today's warm-up
bench press with oh, nine tons."

21:02.560 --> 21:04.152
So you see, Ray Ray...

21:04.400 --> 21:06.118
...as long as there's women...

21:06.360 --> 21:09.670
...there'll be men around
doing stupid things to impress them.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.512
That's why I'm here.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.512
That's why you're here.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.398
That's why they're here.

21:15.640 --> 21:19.269
Now, someday you may evolve
beyond this...

21:19.520 --> 21:21.397
...but it's too late for me.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.995
I'm too old, too married
and lost far too many hacky sacks.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.918
So...

21:33.360 --> 21:36.432
...it's either I split
so you look cool in front of your girl.

21:36.680 --> 21:41.231
Or you look cool in front of yours
and kill me.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.271
Let's rock.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.791
I owe you a lot of thanks.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.873
If you were telling the truth
about the reason you did this...

22:22.120 --> 22:25.317
...I guess I owe you an apology too.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.835
What for? For being a woman?

22:28.800 --> 22:30.028
Accepted.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.236
Hey, Mary Ellen,
let me ask you something.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.152
If I wasn't married...

22:34.400 --> 22:36.755
...and I did what I did for you...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.116
...would I get to nail you?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.559
No.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.508
Then it was all worth it.

22:48.305 --> 22:54.853
