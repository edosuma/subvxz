01:34.320 --> 01:35.833
All right, everybody. Listen up.

01:36.040 --> 01:40.397
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning...

01:40.600 --> 01:42.670
...we raided his headquarters.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.632
Also his last-known address.

01:44.840 --> 01:48.753
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.396
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

01:52.840 --> 01:57.038
So study the face. Study the file.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.515
Get a big old raging hard-on...

01:59.720 --> 02:02.871
...at the idea
of catching this piece of shit.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.676
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.555
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.239
All right.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.271
On the hit parade, 1998.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.357
Reputed to have whacked
one "Dog" Paulson...

02:15.560 --> 02:18.313
...back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away...

02:18.520 --> 02:19.999
...from the SoCal biker gangs.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.476
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

02:23.680 --> 02:27.150
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals...

02:27.360 --> 02:29.874
...I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance...

02:30.080 --> 02:32.230
...of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.276
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.391
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that...

02:37.600 --> 02:39.033
...but we couldn't make it stick.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.708
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.677
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.960
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.878
We sure don't want it going on
up here...

02:51.080 --> 02:52.798
...which brings us to the good news.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.312
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.236
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.796
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...

03:05.000 --> 03:06.558
...a.k.a. Gonzo.

03:06.760 --> 03:11.038
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body--

03:11.240 --> 03:13.515
Either hiding it there
or pulling it out. Not sure.

03:13.720 --> 03:17.030
--when he got his arm crushed
clean off.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.152
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my website. Hilarious.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.237
Anyway. The upshot is...

03:22.440 --> 03:27.560
...we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint...

03:27.760 --> 03:31.036
...which belongs to Señor Tuco.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.676
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.190
That is, provided we find this guy.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.553
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

03:41.760 --> 03:44.149
-Yes.
-Yes.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.713
What the hell was that? Jesus.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.318
Wanna try that again?

03:48.520 --> 03:51.592
-Do you wanna find this guy?
-Yes!

03:51.800 --> 03:54.234
-Are we going to find this guy?
-Yes!

03:54.440 --> 03:55.668
-Louder, damn it!
-Yes!

03:55.880 --> 03:57.711
-Give me a "hell, yeah!"
-Hell, yeah!

03:57.920 --> 03:59.558
-Hell, yeah!
-Hell, yeah!

03:59.760 --> 04:03.116
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.959
They ain't gonna find him.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.276
Guy is in México by now.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.358
Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.718
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.558
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

04:21.800 --> 04:25.110
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.312
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.353
Damn. You don't think he...?

04:33.400 --> 04:34.799
Holler if you need me.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.753
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.878
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so....

05:52.080 --> 05:55.038
But that's what he looks like now.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.471
Without the hair.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.239
Hey, it's me.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.792
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.309
No worries. Happy to help.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.670
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.155
-What about height and weight?
-Five eleven...

06:12.360 --> 06:14.396
...most recently, about 170.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.833
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.759
I guess he weighs a little less.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.077
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.510
What about
other distinguishing features?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.915
Tattoos or moles or scars?

06:30.120 --> 06:34.955
-Anything that might help us.
-Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.879
That's fine.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.832
-ls that the list of medications?
-Yes.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.429
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

06:41.640 --> 06:45.189
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.793
Has he been depressed?

06:52.200 --> 06:57.354
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.195
Yeah.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.510
Last night, he was agitated.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.789
Agitated?

07:05.000 --> 07:09.278
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.029
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

07:16.520 --> 07:21.435
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said:

07:22.600 --> 07:24.079
"l don't know where to begin."

07:25.400 --> 07:27.994
Then he just walked out of the room--
Out of the bathroom.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.758
I was in the tub, taking a bath.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.872
--and when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.558
Nothing else missing?

07:36.800 --> 07:40.554
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.277
But-- What about the phone call?

07:46.680 --> 07:47.669
I'm looking into it.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.636
-What phone call?
-WaIt's cell phone rang.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.992
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.670
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.598
I mean...

08:01.800 --> 08:03.552
...couldn't that be...

08:03.760 --> 08:05.557
...important, right?

08:09.240 --> 08:10.958
Anything else you can think of?

08:11.920 --> 08:13.592
Anything else.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.836
No. I called
the credit card providers...

08:16.040 --> 08:20.955
...and there's no report
of any recent activity.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.312
I-- Let's see. I checked
with every hospital within 50 miles.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.511
Every police station. Every morgue.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.280
So, no, I really don't--
I don't have anything else.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.836
I was actually hoping
that you had something else...

08:34.039 --> 08:36.429
...being that you're the expert.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.033
I'm sorry.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.514
No worries.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.315
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.839
-Mrs. White.
-Thank you.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.349
-Walter.
-Thank you.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.878
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.911
-And?
-Never happened.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.519
No record of it.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.915
-Second cell phone.
-Yeah. I'm thinking.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.274
I understand.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.919
Out.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.989
Get away from me!

10:58.680 --> 11:00.955
Settle down, bitch.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.278
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Shoot me in here!

11:05.480 --> 11:07.675
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

11:07.880 --> 11:09.836
That way, you have to clean it up!

11:13.720 --> 11:14.994
It's your ride, retard.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.031
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.752
Get up.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.198
Get up.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.473
Oh, my God.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.671
Don't do this, Tuco.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.877
No more posters?

13:07.560 --> 13:10.028
Walter Jr.'s making more.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.517
Thank you, Marie.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.834
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.430
I mean, he just doesn't strike me
as the type.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.198
He'll turn up.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.035
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

13:39.240 --> 13:42.630
-...I just find it bewildering that...
-Marie.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.593
-...you didn't believe that--
-Marie.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.118
Not now.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.152
Empty your pockets.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.070
Thought your name was
Heisenberg...

15:50.440 --> 15:52.954
..."Walter Hartwell White."

15:53.160 --> 15:56.232
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.796
You know, a business name.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.071
Yeah.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.669
I like doing business
with a family man.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.350
There's always a lot of collateral.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.554
Answer me one thing.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.036
Can I trust you?

17:01.000 --> 17:04.310
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.590
Sit down.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.791
DEA...

17:27.720 --> 17:30.075
...hit my place of business
this morning.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.396
About a hundred cops
looking for me.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.917
-You two haven't been talking, right?
-No.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.473
No.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.352
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.473
Everybody except Gonzo.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.636
That's weird, right?

17:48.840 --> 17:52.150
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

17:52.360 --> 17:54.954
It's weird. Yes.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.479
Unusual.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.958
Unusual.

17:59.840 --> 18:04.630
Last two days,
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.952
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.511
Explain to me.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.596
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

18:24.200 --> 18:26.077
I saw this coming.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.709
I can see the future, you know?

18:29.920 --> 18:34.391
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.828
I knew last night they were gonna
come try and bust me.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.475
Gonzo.

18:42.760 --> 18:47.754
He went and snitched to the cops!
That lousy son of a bitch!

18:48.480 --> 18:54.396
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

18:54.600 --> 18:58.036
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
I'm gonna skin him...

18:58.240 --> 19:01.596
...and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag...

19:01.800 --> 19:05.759
...and every time I hit him,
it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!

19:05.960 --> 19:09.839
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

19:15.880 --> 19:21.557
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

19:22.560 --> 19:23.595
What?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.795
You're saying, Tuco....

19:27.000 --> 19:29.673
You're saying that Gonzo...

19:29.880 --> 19:33.998
...is currently operating
as a police informant...

19:34.200 --> 19:35.349
...as far as you know?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.795
I'm very sorry to hear that.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.712
That's disappointing.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.275
Yeah.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.313
-I'd waste him too, yo.
-Shut up.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.839
Okay.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.794
They're out there looking for me
right now.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.673
They got ghetto birds
and black ops.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.839
I need to get high.
I need to get good and high.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.469
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.550
No, it's-- It's killer.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.234
Yeah, seriously.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.479
So I was thinking last night.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.238
I came up with this great idea.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.797
-Mexico?
-We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.672
We'll set you up in a superlab.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.269
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.277
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us...

20:37.480 --> 20:39.596
...because I got my people there.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.518
Connections.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.755
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

20:45.960 --> 20:47.951
Tuco, l....

20:48.440 --> 20:50.670
I have a wife and family.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.916
So what? You'll get another one.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.999
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but I can't just...

20:58.200 --> 21:00.475
...uproot my life like that.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.557
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.118
Who's talking to you?

21:10.480 --> 21:13.233
You need me, man...

21:13.440 --> 21:16.477
...because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.632
Yeah.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.353
I'll tell you something, yo.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.279
You never tried nothing like it.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.516
Stink or no stink...

21:27.720 --> 21:31.998
...one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.435
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.870
Careful when you hit it.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.799
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.150
It's got a secret ingredient.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.793
What secret ingredient?

21:52.880 --> 21:54.677
Chilli powder.

22:01.640 --> 22:02.959
I hate chilli powder.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.718
This blue magic, this is money.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.828
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.954
We're gonna rewrite history
with this.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.799
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.750
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.871
I need him very, very badly.

22:37.240 --> 22:38.229
He's my partner.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.308
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

22:45.440 --> 22:48.477
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now...

22:48.680 --> 22:51.353
...to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset...

22:51.560 --> 22:54.870
...and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

22:56.800 --> 22:58.279
And you....

22:59.560 --> 23:02.313
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.114
-Where are you going?
-Louis is taking me to the train station.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.992
We'll put these up.

23:23.200 --> 23:27.034
-No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
-He wants to help, let him help.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.516
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

23:31.440 --> 23:34.637
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

23:35.280 --> 23:38.158
For chrissake,
you got a bun in the oven.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.556
I got my cell if you need me.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.751
-Okay?
-Okay.

23:44.120 --> 23:47.635
-Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
-All right. Bye.

23:50.240 --> 23:54.756
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet...

23:54.960 --> 23:56.712
...bodes well.

23:57.800 --> 24:01.952
Well, I mean, if he-- You know.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.872
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.556
There's got to be something.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.557
Some detail
that we haven't picked up on.

24:11.560 --> 24:14.950
-What about the second cell phone?
-Jesus.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.630
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.996
Okay. What are you talking about?

24:26.200 --> 24:30.079
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

24:30.280 --> 24:32.475
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.310
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.476
But his phone rang. I heard it.

24:38.640 --> 24:43.634
All right. Well, then if that's the case,
he must have a second phone.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.234
Why? What sense would there be
in that?

24:48.440 --> 24:51.352
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.872
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.036
What does it mean?

24:59.240 --> 25:01.276
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

25:02.760 --> 25:05.433
It means Walt has a secret.

25:05.640 --> 25:09.315
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

25:10.280 --> 25:14.239
-Okay. Everyone. Okay.
-Skyler, come on.

25:14.440 --> 25:18.194
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.799
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.309
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.757
Walt? Please.

25:32.960 --> 25:38.353
-What about the marijuana?
-He's not on pot anymore.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.471
Says who? Him?

25:40.680 --> 25:42.716
Chemotherapy
and marijuana go together...

25:42.920 --> 25:46.674
...Iike apple pie and Chevrolet.

25:46.880 --> 25:51.351
Maybe he's addicted to the pot...

25:51.560 --> 25:53.516
...and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.678
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.713
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

26:01.040 --> 26:04.476
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.193
He may know something.

26:11.400 --> 26:15.029
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.868
Then grasp.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.912
Excuse me, ma'am.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.832
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

26:34.640 --> 26:36.312
No. I'm afraid not.

26:36.520 --> 26:39.318
-Why?
-I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

26:39.520 --> 26:43.752
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.032
He taught your son chemistry
in high school.

26:47.240 --> 26:50.437
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.154
-That was a long time ago.
-Yes, ma'am.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.875
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.870
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.233
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.670
He really tried to motivate him.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.155
He was one of the few teachers
who cared.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.078
Yeah, WaIt's that way.
He's a good man.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.717
I'm so sorry
to hear about his illness.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.478
Please pass along our best wishes.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.877
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.229
He's missing, actually.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.593
Just kind of walked off, or....

27:24.920 --> 27:26.956
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around...

27:27.160 --> 27:29.674
...trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.518
That's terrible.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.915
Anything we can do to help.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.953
Well, if you could put me in touch
with your son....

27:37.160 --> 27:40.072
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

27:40.280 --> 27:44.159
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

27:44.360 --> 27:48.319
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

27:49.520 --> 27:52.318
I don't necessarily. I just--

27:52.520 --> 27:54.636
-Are you with the police?
-No, ma'am. Not at all.

27:57.640 --> 28:01.713
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.394
Oh, my God.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.635
Is my son in trouble?

28:04.840 --> 28:07.195
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.789
Do I need to get a lawyer?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.468
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this...

28:12.680 --> 28:14.989
...coming here and asking questions
about my son and--

28:15.200 --> 28:17.509
Mrs. Pinkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

28:17.720 --> 28:21.235
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.112
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

28:24.160 --> 28:28.153
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.034
I'm sorry. I would like to help you...

28:32.240 --> 28:34.629
...but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

28:34.840 --> 28:38.071
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.796
Well, thanks for your time.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.796
If you could tell me one more thing.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.198
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

28:54.040 --> 28:58.591
If he had spent half as much time
and money on his education...

28:58.800 --> 29:02.839
...as he has
on that ridiculous bouncing car....

29:04.200 --> 29:06.077
Low rider, huh?

29:07.400 --> 29:08.753
Gomey, hey.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.679
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out...

29:11.880 --> 29:13.871
...a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo...

29:14.080 --> 29:18.312
...registered to a one
Jesse Pinkman.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.512
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

29:21.720 --> 29:25.110
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

29:25.320 --> 29:28.517
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.271
Chilli powder.

29:56.680 --> 30:00.150
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

30:00.360 --> 30:01.634
Whatever, man.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.512
At least I tried something.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.551
Hey, it almost worked too.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.718
How's about
you leaving my gun, huh?

30:08.920 --> 30:11.639
First you boost it,
then you leave it in your house.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.432
My gun.

30:14.640 --> 30:19.998
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

30:20.200 --> 30:23.237
Well, at least he wants you alive.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.588
Hey, I don't get it.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.678
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

31:00.880 --> 31:02.518
I don't know.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.957
I don't know.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.118
Does it really matter?

31:08.320 --> 31:12.108
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant...

31:12.320 --> 31:14.311
...who does he
automatically blame?

31:14.520 --> 31:16.272
Us.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.478
We need a plan.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.751
-Think, think.
-Let's just bum-rush him, man.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.110
You crack him over
the head with something...

31:28.320 --> 31:30.276
...and I'll go for his gun.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.558
Crack him over the head
with something?

31:40.600 --> 31:43.194
Hey, you got the C-bomb, man,
all right?

31:43.400 --> 31:44.992
You're as good
as checked out already.

31:45.200 --> 31:49.113
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.673
Just....

31:53.000 --> 31:55.594
Oh, so my life
is not the priority here...

31:55.800 --> 31:58.234
...because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.158
That's your point?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.279
Yeah.

32:28.840 --> 32:31.718
We gotta get him to take this.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.195
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chilli P.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.152
That much has been established.

32:36.360 --> 32:39.193
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump....

32:44.360 --> 32:47.796
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.754
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

33:07.960 --> 33:11.077
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.718
Take it easy, Tio.

33:51.240 --> 33:55.028
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.312
What?

34:11.760 --> 34:13.591
I get it, I get it, I get it.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.839
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.156
I tell you, Heisenberg.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.188
Old people.

34:24.320 --> 34:25.911
You feed them, huh?

34:26.120 --> 34:28.634
You put them in a really nice crib
in the country...

34:28.840 --> 34:32.071
...and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.398
You better eat every bite of that.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.309
What did you do that for?

35:00.520 --> 35:02.351
God!

35:44.840 --> 35:47.035
Hey, look. Look.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.798
There's nothing left.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.630
What? What do you want?

36:23.600 --> 36:24.999
No.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.317
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.714
Don't go there.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.397
Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?

36:46.440 --> 36:49.113
What, you don't like them?

36:51.320 --> 36:52.309
One ding.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.751
That means yes. Tio don't like you.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.554
Why don't you like them, Tio?

37:05.680 --> 37:07.671
You don't trust them?

37:14.160 --> 37:19.188
-Why don't you trust them, Tio?
-Tuco, come on. He's....

37:19.680 --> 37:23.195
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.758
Did they do something to you, Tio?

37:41.400 --> 37:42.992
Something that you don't like?

37:49.800 --> 37:53.588
What did they do to you?
What did you do to my tio?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.028
Nothing. Nothing.

37:55.240 --> 37:59.836
-Bullshit! My tio does not lie!
-I don't know. I swear. I don't know.

38:00.040 --> 38:04.636
No, l-- Maybe it was-- I did change
the channel on his TV, but....

38:04.840 --> 38:06.990
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking...

38:07.200 --> 38:10.556
...he was watching
one of those telenovels...

38:10.760 --> 38:13.274
...with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.072
I told you
not to change the channel.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.158
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.396
Is that it, Tio?

38:27.880 --> 38:29.916
Is that it, Tio?

38:31.560 --> 38:32.913
Did they change your mamitas?

38:41.720 --> 38:43.756
What are you telling me, Tio?

38:46.440 --> 38:47.668
Are they punking me?

39:02.400 --> 39:04.755
Hey. No.

39:04.960 --> 39:08.236
No, man. No.

39:08.440 --> 39:09.839
-Come here!
-No.

39:10.040 --> 39:13.430
No, no, Tuco.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.878
Tuco, no. Tuco.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.798
Shut up!

39:40.360 --> 39:44.114
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.709
No, God. I don't wanna die.

39:46.920 --> 39:48.797
Tell me what you did, Walter!

39:49.000 --> 39:52.151
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.957
-No!
-Tell me what you did!

40:01.480 --> 40:03.710
We tried to poison you.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.276
We tried to poison you...

40:09.000 --> 40:12.959
...because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth...

40:13.160 --> 40:15.037
...and you deserve to die.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.036
Who's the bitch now?

41:17.680 --> 41:19.591
Let him bleed.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.352
The keys.

41:40.320 --> 41:41.833
Tuco.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.192
Oh, my God.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.513
The cousins?

42:42.120 --> 42:43.348
What the hell is going on?

42:54.680 --> 42:56.477
Jesse Pinkman.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.316
You're a hard man to find.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.310
Oh, shit.

43:20.200 --> 43:21.758
Easy.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.510
Oh, my God.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.437
Oh, God. Hank.

44:42.640 --> 44:43.993
-Who?
-Hank.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.519
