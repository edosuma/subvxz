WEBVTT

00:09.202 --> 00:14.002
Nothing like this ever
happened to me before.

00:14.875 --> 00:17.426
What I saw was a darkness.

00:17.427 --> 00:21.747
It was something that was unexplainable.

00:23.383 --> 00:29.283
Just felt like something evil, some kind
of spirit was upstairs in our house.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.650
[Screams]

00:32.793 --> 00:37.997
There was no doubt in my mind
that it was something demonic.

00:37.998 --> 00:39.583
I had the power.

00:39.584 --> 00:42.704
I could make it rain.

00:42.941 --> 00:44.737
Kids, kids. Come on.

00:44.738 --> 00:46.243
There was panic in the room.

00:46.244 --> 00:47.750
Let me out!

00:47.751 --> 00:49.205
[Screams]

00:49.206 --> 00:51.932
I didn't know why this was happening to me.

00:51.933 --> 00:53.549
I exorcise thee.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.084
[Yells]

00:55.085 --> 00:59.645
Whatever was there was still inside of me.

01:15.495 --> 01:18.430
The first time that I saw Don Decker,

01:18.431 --> 01:23.111
he was an inmate at the Monroe County jail.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.459
Back in 1983, I went to prison.

01:31.460 --> 01:37.360
I got sentenced to one to two years
for receiving stolen property.

01:42.188 --> 01:47.708
I wanted to do my time and
get my life back together.

01:48.561 --> 01:50.181
Decker.

01:50.182 --> 01:51.861
You ready?

01:51.862 --> 01:54.366
Don wasn't like other inmates.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.727
He was quiet, introverted.

01:57.937 --> 02:01.837
He was not a social bee at all.

02:04.403 --> 02:06.779
But then my grandfather died,

02:06.780 --> 02:12.600
and they gave me a weekend
pass to go out to the funeral.

02:12.850 --> 02:16.388
Donald was released on a furlough.

02:16.389 --> 02:21.249
He wasn't thought to be
a threat to society.

02:27.035 --> 02:31.115
I went to my grandfather's funeral.

02:33.841 --> 02:37.681
But I didn't want to be there.

02:40.857 --> 02:45.057
My grandfather was a very bad person.

02:48.456 --> 02:51.876
He was very, very abusive.

02:53.057 --> 02:58.957
He hurt me when I was growing
up, and I was glad he was dead.

03:10.144 --> 03:12.613
I originally met Don...

03:12.614 --> 03:15.665
My wife and his mother worked together.

03:15.666 --> 03:19.820
I got a call from him one day telling me
that his grandfather had passed away,

03:19.821 --> 03:22.743
but his mom wouldn't
allow him to come home.

03:22.744 --> 03:28.644
I told him it didn't matter. He could
stay with us however long he wanted to.

03:35.031 --> 03:37.124
I was very, very grateful.

03:37.125 --> 03:39.439
There was not a lot of
people that would do that

03:39.440 --> 03:41.675
for somebody that just came out of jail.

03:41.676 --> 03:43.896
[Knocking]

03:47.314 --> 03:49.554
He realized he made a mistake.

03:49.555 --> 03:54.186
He was hanging out with the wrong people
but wanted to straighten his life out.

03:54.187 --> 03:57.847
I wanted to try to help him.

04:03.264 --> 04:04.862
I was a little worried about him,

04:04.863 --> 04:09.749
because I knew he was upset about
his grandfather's funeral.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.534
I didn't know all the details at the time,

04:12.535 --> 04:18.435
but I knew there was some kind of problem
between Donnie and his grandfather.

04:20.173 --> 04:22.813
Dinner's ready.

04:37.665 --> 04:43.565
I went upstairs to the restroom to wash
my hands up and get ready for supper...

04:47.630 --> 04:51.110
And got this weird feeling.

04:56.217 --> 05:00.297
The atmosphere was totally different.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.600
- Here we are.
- We sat down at the table.

05:10.631 --> 05:16.271
Donnie was taking a little
longer than we thought normal.

05:19.207 --> 05:24.067
I turned to get the towel
to wipe my hands...

05:25.021 --> 05:27.301
And then...

05:27.548 --> 05:31.568
All the air went out of the room.

05:31.783 --> 05:35.563
It was like being in a vacuum.

05:36.357 --> 05:39.597
It was very, very cold.

05:44.598 --> 05:46.432
[Dramatic music]

05:46.433 --> 05:48.653
[Grunting]

05:50.956 --> 05:55.276
I felt like something was attacking me.

05:56.879 --> 05:59.759
Trying to hurt me.

06:02.984 --> 06:06.464
I looked toward the window.

06:09.157 --> 06:11.524
It was a face.

06:11.525 --> 06:16.145
It looked like an old man wearing a crown.

06:19.321 --> 06:21.121
Ah!

06:23.718 --> 06:25.518
Oh!

06:29.110 --> 06:32.350
[Dramatic music subsides]

06:36.713 --> 06:39.293
I looked down.

06:40.387 --> 06:43.924
And I saw three scratches
going down my arm.

06:43.925 --> 06:49.145
There was blood at the end,
big droplets of blood.

06:51.032 --> 06:53.333
I was confused and scared.

06:53.334 --> 06:55.000
You know, I didn't know...

06:55.001 --> 06:59.261
I didn't know why this was happening.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.276
Larry, can you go and see...

07:03.277 --> 07:06.411
My son Larry went to tell
him, Donnie, come on.

07:06.412 --> 07:09.592
We're waiting for you.

07:11.371 --> 07:14.551
Donnie, dinner's ready.

07:15.957 --> 07:20.517
I didn't want to tell them what happened.

07:23.732 --> 07:27.572
It was a hard story to believe.

07:44.072 --> 07:47.012
I was very nervous.

07:48.522 --> 07:51.702
When Donnie came down...

07:52.435 --> 07:55.929
He had a strange look on his face.

07:55.930 --> 07:58.690
Very, very white.

07:59.917 --> 08:03.697
It looked like he was in pain.

08:03.889 --> 08:06.229
Let's eat.

08:07.542 --> 08:13.442
The next thing I know, he was reaching
to grab something on the table.

08:13.847 --> 08:17.207
I took hold of his hand.

08:20.486 --> 08:24.626
And I saw blood marks on his wrist.

08:28.729 --> 08:33.332
I said, Donnie, what did
you do to yourself?

08:33.333 --> 08:35.328
He just looked at me. He
says, Bob, he says...

08:35.330 --> 08:38.090
I didn't do it.

08:39.033 --> 08:42.453
He said, I didn't do it.

08:44.078 --> 08:45.938
Bob.

08:46.948 --> 08:50.183
There's something up there.

08:50.184 --> 08:56.084
He said, I swear to God there was a
face in the window, staring at me.

08:56.757 --> 09:00.777
He said, it looked like the devil.

09:07.208 --> 09:11.032
After dinner, we all moved
into the living room.

09:11.033 --> 09:13.539
I was worried about Donnie.

09:13.540 --> 09:19.440
There's no way he did that himself, but
I couldn't understand what happened.

09:21.949 --> 09:24.101
It started getting cold in the room.

09:24.102 --> 09:27.282
The temperature changed.

09:29.485 --> 09:34.869
It felt like the same cold that
was upstairs in the bathroom,

09:34.870 --> 09:39.010
but I didn't say anything about it.

09:44.438 --> 09:46.298
Bob.

09:47.241 --> 09:50.361
Jeannie, she looks up.

09:51.412 --> 09:55.432
Bob, I think we've got a problem.

10:11.935 --> 10:15.784
I just didn't understand why
it was so cold in that room.

10:15.785 --> 10:17.645
Bob.

10:18.755 --> 10:22.775
Bob, I think we've got a problem.

10:29.700 --> 10:35.340
Jeannie, I said, "there's
something weird going on here".

10:39.791 --> 10:43.871
We see water running down the wall.

10:45.611 --> 10:48.890
We thought there had to
be some kind of leak,

10:48.891 --> 10:52.461
but there's no water in
that end of the house.

10:52.462 --> 10:55.521
There's no water lines in anyplace
but the kitchen and the bathroom,

10:55.522 --> 10:58.834
which were in the back of the house.

10:58.835 --> 11:03.695
I just didn't know where
it was coming from.

11:04.413 --> 11:08.493
It wasn't water as you know water.

11:10.151 --> 11:16.051
You'd rub your fingers on it, and
it was a sticky, tacky feeling.

11:18.393 --> 11:21.153
It wasn't water.

11:27.012 --> 11:29.832
All of a sudden...

11:30.702 --> 11:33.518
We heard this noise.

11:33.519 --> 11:35.453
What is that?

11:35.454 --> 11:37.734
And then...

11:38.678 --> 11:43.238
We saw water drops falling out of nowhere.

11:48.258 --> 11:52.758
It was like it was raining in the house.

11:54.509 --> 11:55.938
Kids, kids.

11:55.939 --> 11:58.099
Come on.

12:00.512 --> 12:06.092
They were strange drops, and
they were moving very fast.

12:08.338 --> 12:11.578
Got heavier and heavier.

12:13.243 --> 12:14.510
Get in the other room.

12:14.511 --> 12:17.751
Kids were all shook up.

12:18.948 --> 12:23.928
We were all frightened.
Everybody was frightened.

12:33.383 --> 12:36.323
It felt very eerie.

12:44.241 --> 12:50.061
Jeannie and I were trying to
figure out what was going on.

12:51.748 --> 12:57.648
I was scared to go upstairs, because
that's where Donnie said he was attacked.

13:08.065 --> 13:11.305
I'm going to call Ron.

13:13.670 --> 13:15.886
So, I decided to call my landlord.

13:15.887 --> 13:18.467
[Phone ringing]

13:18.776 --> 13:19.812
Hello.

13:19.813 --> 13:22.115
I picked up the phone,
and it was Bob Kieffer,

13:22.116 --> 13:25.329
and he said, Ron, you've got to come down.

13:25.330 --> 13:28.656
- Okay.
- I've got a problem down here.

13:28.657 --> 13:31.515
He asked me what it was, and I did
not want to tell him on the phone,

13:31.516 --> 13:33.784
because I knew he'd think I was crazy.

13:33.785 --> 13:36.138
Bob, are you sure that I have to come down?

13:36.139 --> 13:37.521
Yes, just please come over.

13:37.522 --> 13:43.422
I told him, I says, Ron, you just have
to come in here and see for yourself.

13:44.441 --> 13:48.391
My wife and I, we got in the car.

13:48.392 --> 13:52.412
We had no idea what was happening.

14:07.085 --> 14:11.989
We couldn't figure out where in the
world all this water was coming from.

14:11.990 --> 14:14.925
I looked around the room.

14:14.926 --> 14:18.261
It can't be... you know, it can't be.

14:18.262 --> 14:21.239
There has to be a leak someplace.

14:21.240 --> 14:26.321
We thought maybe the rain had
gotten in through the roof,

14:26.322 --> 14:31.122
but it hadn't been raining
outside for days.

14:34.663 --> 14:40.483
So I said to Bob, let's go
upstairs and check things out.

14:44.473 --> 14:48.133
I just dreaded going upstairs.

14:49.509 --> 14:52.029
I was scared.

15:00.523 --> 15:04.359
Something was definitely going on.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.571
I didn't think it was
coming out of the pipes.

15:07.572 --> 15:13.472
I thought it could be the spirit of
my grandfather trying to hurt me.

15:20.874 --> 15:25.434
It just did not feel good to be upstairs.

15:35.591 --> 15:37.531
I had a creepy feeling.

15:37.532 --> 15:40.652
It was cold and damp.

15:46.178 --> 15:49.538
Just didn't feel natural.

15:50.939 --> 15:53.219
It's dry.

16:08.491 --> 16:10.831
It's good.

16:13.762 --> 16:14.611
[Door slams]

16:14.612 --> 16:17.192
What was that?

16:34.737 --> 16:35.762
[Door slams]

16:35.763 --> 16:38.343
What was that?

16:48.150 --> 16:52.110
It just felt like something evil...

16:54.505 --> 16:57.565
Some kind of spirit...

16:58.761 --> 17:03.141
Was upstairs in our house at that time.

17:05.673 --> 17:08.973
[Ominous music crescendos]

17:12.557 --> 17:15.192
There was something up there.

17:15.193 --> 17:19.213
I could feel it, couldn't see it.

17:19.797 --> 17:22.977
Something was up there.

17:27.739 --> 17:29.573
[Water splattering]

17:29.574 --> 17:32.814
We came back downstairs.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.846
It was still raining.

17:37.072 --> 17:39.772
Drops everywhere.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.922
Don was sitting on the couch.

17:45.923 --> 17:49.043
I looked over at him.

17:52.239 --> 17:57.939
It looked like he was a thousand
miles away in his head.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.308
No response to TV.

18:04.309 --> 18:06.434
No response to calling his name.

18:06.435 --> 18:08.779
Donnie. Donnie.

18:08.780 --> 18:12.860
He was there, but he wasn't there.

18:14.886 --> 18:18.846
I got a strange feeling from him.

18:19.102 --> 18:22.061
I didn't know what was going on.

18:22.062 --> 18:26.922
The feeling like I was
falling into a trance.

18:31.603 --> 18:36.230
And all at once, the
strangest thing happened.

18:36.231 --> 18:41.391
I saw water come from the
floor, and it come up.

18:46.150 --> 18:48.885
It wasn't condensation.

18:48.886 --> 18:51.222
It wasn't a leak.

18:51.223 --> 18:54.583
It would just materialize.

18:56.574 --> 19:00.414
It was just extraordinary, just...

19:01.199 --> 19:03.839
Incomprehensible.

19:06.971 --> 19:10.631
Donnie was still in a trance.

19:11.221 --> 19:14.951
I don't really know what was happening.

19:14.952 --> 19:17.748
- Donnie.
- Things were a little blurry.

19:17.749 --> 19:20.929
I just can't remember.

19:22.387 --> 19:26.390
I told Ron, I said, "Ron, I think
I really want to call the cops".

19:26.391 --> 19:32.211
I'd feel better if I knew the
cops were involved in this.

19:32.430 --> 19:38.330
That particular evening, I happened
to be working a 4:00 to 12:00 shift.

19:38.570 --> 19:41.334
Stroudsburg police station, officer Baujan.

19:41.335 --> 19:43.774
The individual on the other end
of the phone said, it's Bob,

19:43.775 --> 19:47.010
and I immediately knew it was Bob Kieffer.

19:47.011 --> 19:51.782
Stroudsburg is a small, quiet
area, kind of uneventful.

19:51.783 --> 19:56.953
Bob was a guy I knew from around
town, a genuinely nice individual.

19:56.954 --> 20:00.174
I didn't know him as a type
that would exaggerate,

20:00.175 --> 20:04.027
so when Bob said that he
had a problem, I listened.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.730
I said, John, I need you
to come to my house.

20:06.731 --> 20:09.239
There's some kind of a
problem with the water.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.025
This is the police station,
Bob, not the water department.

20:12.026 --> 20:17.926
I just need you to trust me. I need
you to come to my house right away.

20:19.611 --> 20:22.906
You could just hear it in his
voice that he was serious

20:22.907 --> 20:25.322
and that he needed me to come to that house

20:25.323 --> 20:31.223
because he had a situation at his house
that he just couldn't handle on his own.

20:38.896 --> 20:41.752
As soon as we heard officer
Baujan's patrol car

20:41.753 --> 20:46.013
pull up outside, we were at the door.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.590
When they came in the house, John...

20:53.591 --> 20:57.885
His partner, and I moved
into the living room.

20:57.886 --> 21:01.047
Within seconds of entering that room.

21:01.048 --> 21:04.348
I had this cold feeling.

21:04.998 --> 21:09.558
Bob says, this is what I'm talking about.

21:11.484 --> 21:14.844
And I got it immediately.

21:17.290 --> 21:23.190
Droplets would come from the
floor, absolutely defying gravity.

21:24.637 --> 21:27.697
It was truly amazing.

21:33.273 --> 21:39.173
And we're literally standing several
feet apart, face-to-face...

21:39.946 --> 21:43.186
When, all of a sudden...

21:45.288 --> 21:49.188
This drop materializes between us.

21:50.873 --> 21:53.328
The drop looked big.

21:53.329 --> 21:56.398
It looked like it was
meant for us to see it.

21:56.399 --> 22:00.668
It flies through the living
room, through the dining room,

22:00.669 --> 22:06.189
and into the darkness of the
kitchen and out of sight.

22:12.915 --> 22:16.083
I was the cop at the scene,
and they were looking to me

22:16.084 --> 22:21.604
for some help and a sense
of direction of what to do.

22:22.024 --> 22:25.504
I had no answers for them.

22:39.648 --> 22:43.006
Something's wrong, and it wasn't the house.

22:43.007 --> 22:45.527
I knew that...

22:46.115 --> 22:47.979
When I looked at him.

22:47.980 --> 22:51.700
I felt suspicious about Donnie.

22:55.827 --> 23:01.727
Don had come in that day, and all of
a sudden, it's raining in our house.

23:04.666 --> 23:07.846
I felt very uncomfortable.

23:07.847 --> 23:13.747
They were talking about me like somehow
I was involved in doing something.

23:19.628 --> 23:24.576
My wife and Jeannie cornered
him out in the kitchen.

23:24.577 --> 23:25.996
Donnie, why are you doing this?

23:25.997 --> 23:29.781
They wanted to know what was going on,
and they wanted him to tell them.

23:29.782 --> 23:32.584
- Do you hear us?
- The women, they were really scared.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.503
They were desperate for
Donnie to stop this.

23:34.504 --> 23:36.088
You are frightening everyone here!

23:36.089 --> 23:39.764
They started screaming at him,
shouting at him, Donnie, stop it.

23:39.765 --> 23:41.300
We know you are doing this.

23:41.301 --> 23:44.573
Donnie, will you please just
tell us what's going on?

23:44.574 --> 23:47.174
- Stop it, Donnie!
- We really wanted an answer.

23:47.175 --> 23:50.386
- Right now!
- They just kept plugging away at him.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.881
- We know you are doing this.
- We know you're doing this.

23:52.882 --> 23:54.292
Why are you doing this?

23:54.293 --> 23:55.700
Listen to us!

23:55.701 --> 23:58.284
Donnie didn't say a word.

23:58.285 --> 24:01.825
You are frightening everyone!

24:01.864 --> 24:05.104
[Distant muffled yelling]

24:05.202 --> 24:07.831
Donnie was just very blank.

24:07.832 --> 24:09.486
Stop it, Donnie!

24:09.487 --> 24:10.939
Stop it, Donnie!

24:10.940 --> 24:13.252
You stop it!

24:13.253 --> 24:14.703
Right now!

24:14.704 --> 24:17.012
[Clattering]

24:17.013 --> 24:21.083
All at once, this clattering started.

24:21.084 --> 24:25.193
The pots and the pans and the dishes...

24:25.194 --> 24:28.014
Were just shaking.

24:29.158 --> 24:31.318
Clanging.

24:38.835 --> 24:39.688
[Screams]

24:39.689 --> 24:44.249
And he just quickly raised up in the air.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.750
[Screams]

25:00.562 --> 25:03.982
It was just beyond belief.

25:04.413 --> 25:07.593
I was scared to death.

25:11.573 --> 25:15.413
And it threw him in the corner.

25:15.510 --> 25:18.178
It just flung him back.

25:18.179 --> 25:20.747
He went five, six feet.

25:20.748 --> 25:22.512
Bam, down on the floor.

25:22.513 --> 25:24.733
Bob! Bob!

25:29.056 --> 25:32.493
When I hit the floor, that's
when I got my feeling back.

25:32.494 --> 25:36.499
Before that happened, I didn't
know I was up in the air.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.568
I didn't know what... what...
what it was, you know.

25:39.569 --> 25:42.809
I was scared, you know.

25:43.758 --> 25:47.658
Then I felt the pain in my arm.

25:49.797 --> 25:54.597
And I realized that I'd
been attacked again.

25:55.091 --> 25:56.891
Ah!

25:57.090 --> 26:00.630
And I saw a King's crown...

26:01.400 --> 26:03.740
On my arm.

26:04.242 --> 26:08.802
I don't know who it was or what it was.

26:17.611 --> 26:20.634
I didn't know what was going on.

26:20.635 --> 26:24.715
I didn't know what was doing this.

26:27.709 --> 26:32.209
There was no shadow of doubt in my mind.

26:32.890 --> 26:36.670
I was in the presence of evil.

26:36.820 --> 26:40.000
Whether it was in him.

26:40.496 --> 26:42.812
Or around him.

26:42.813 --> 26:45.368
I don't know.

26:45.369 --> 26:50.649
But it was definitely a
demonic force at work here.

27:00.718 --> 27:06.118
Quick, let's get him something
to clean him up with.

27:06.423 --> 27:10.817
I thought there was some kind
of spirit controlling him.

27:10.818 --> 27:13.617
Some kind of demon in him.

27:13.618 --> 27:17.342
I knew now this was my grandfather.

27:17.343 --> 27:21.903
He wanted to hurt me, keep on hurting me.

27:23.843 --> 27:27.420
We were definitely running out of options.

27:27.421 --> 27:33.301
The only thing we could think
of was getting the Bible out.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.666
I felt like I'd left the
Kieffers kind of hanging there.

27:40.667 --> 27:42.648
I had to go back.

27:42.649 --> 27:47.269
I wanted to make sure that they were okay.

27:57.751 --> 28:03.651
I've never experienced anything that
I haven't been able to explain.

28:03.790 --> 28:09.010
In my opinion, it was nothing
to play around with.

28:09.714 --> 28:12.216
I couldn't help but be
frightened about this.

28:12.217 --> 28:14.715
Valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear...

28:14.716 --> 28:17.640
And as soon as I walked
into the living room,

28:17.641 --> 28:20.391
I sensed a total different atmosphere.

28:20.392 --> 28:22.459
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

28:22.460 --> 28:23.973
There was panic in the room.

28:23.974 --> 28:26.533
The Lord is my Shepherd! I shall not want!

28:26.534 --> 28:29.512
She was reading 23rd psalms.

28:29.513 --> 28:33.755
She thought that might help
calm what was controlling him.

28:33.756 --> 28:36.815
In the presence of mine enemies.

28:36.816 --> 28:41.263
The droplets of water, instead of
going randomly about the room,

28:41.264 --> 28:43.131
would all concentrate on her.

28:43.132 --> 28:45.000
Beside the still waters...

28:45.001 --> 28:48.301
And she would be pelted.

28:49.643 --> 28:53.576
It absolutely intensified when
she read from that Bible.

28:53.577 --> 28:59.477
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life!

28:59.602 --> 29:01.966
It just heightened my belief.

29:01.967 --> 29:04.159
Thy rod and thy staff,
they will comfort me.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.762
That has to be the devil.

29:05.763 --> 29:10.593
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life

29:10.594 --> 29:15.874
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever!

29:16.065 --> 29:18.165
Forever!

29:36.253 --> 29:38.562
Don's furlough was over.

29:38.563 --> 29:42.358
He had to go back to Stroudsburg
jail to finish his sentence.

29:42.359 --> 29:46.259
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

29:47.430 --> 29:51.790
I liked Donnie. He was a really good kid.

29:51.791 --> 29:56.538
But I felt a sense of
relief when he was gone.

29:56.539 --> 30:02.439
After what happened that weekend,
I left, and I never went back.

30:04.819 --> 30:07.999
I never saw him again.

30:10.520 --> 30:14.020
I still felt scared when I left.

30:14.021 --> 30:17.084
I knew, you know, it wasn't gone yet.

30:17.085 --> 30:21.645
Whatever was there was still inside of me.

30:27.337 --> 30:29.912
When Donald came back to the jail.

30:29.913 --> 30:34.171
There was a lot of talk with different
shifts, different officers.

30:34.172 --> 30:37.652
There was a lot of fright.

30:45.023 --> 30:50.320
All the inmates heard what
was going on at the house.

30:50.321 --> 30:53.381
They were all scared.

30:54.353 --> 30:58.253
The guards, they were scared too.

31:00.339 --> 31:04.779
The whole atmosphere about him was just...

31:06.042 --> 31:08.382
Just eerie.

31:08.545 --> 31:12.865
You knew that something was not normal.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.859
I knew now.

31:21.029 --> 31:23.789
I had the power.

31:25.662 --> 31:28.602
I could control it.

31:29.098 --> 31:32.218
I could make it rain.

31:47.648 --> 31:51.908
There was an evil presence around him.

31:54.187 --> 32:00.087
This was so abnormal that we felt
that the supernatural was present.

32:19.579 --> 32:23.179
Water was all over his cell.

32:36.064 --> 32:39.544
Water was going horizontal...

32:40.310 --> 32:42.530
Vertical...

32:45.148 --> 32:47.627
Climbing up the walls...

32:47.628 --> 32:51.168
Defying the laws of gravity.

32:52.489 --> 32:54.485
What's going on here, Donnie?

32:54.486 --> 32:56.526
Donnie!

33:04.834 --> 33:06.984
Help! Help!

33:06.985 --> 33:08.860
Guards, help, please!

33:08.861 --> 33:10.172
The inmate was scared.

33:10.173 --> 33:12.408
Guard, get me out of here!

33:12.409 --> 33:14.799
He wanted to get out of there.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.084
Somebody, let me out!

33:17.085 --> 33:19.620
- He screamed.
- Hey, guard!

33:19.621 --> 33:21.375
- He yelled.
- Help, please!

33:21.376 --> 33:24.511
- He didn't want to be near me.
- Let me out!

33:24.512 --> 33:27.572
Open up! Let me out!

33:27.782 --> 33:29.762
Guard!

33:39.788 --> 33:44.226
After that, we had to move him, put him in
a different cell in the main cell block.

33:44.227 --> 33:46.927
House him alone.

33:52.773 --> 33:55.038
Two guards, they came to my cell.

33:55.039 --> 33:57.439
Hey, Decker.

33:57.558 --> 33:59.424
They didn't believe what happened.

33:59.425 --> 34:00.977
I will bet you...

34:00.978 --> 34:06.878
They asked me, see if I could hit
the Warden out in his office.

34:07.117 --> 34:09.504
- So I told them...
- I'll try.

34:09.505 --> 34:13.284
[Laughs] He'll try. He'll try.

34:33.143 --> 34:39.043
We just finished with the evening meal,
and I had a lot of paperwork to do.

34:40.186 --> 34:44.326
And I started to write some reports.

34:52.460 --> 34:56.601
It was, like, almost like meditation.

35:00.983 --> 35:05.123
It felt like I had a certain power.

35:09.076 --> 35:12.616
Snap! And I went like that.

35:40.915 --> 35:46.815
I looked down, and right here on the
center of my chest, it was all wet.

35:48.431 --> 35:52.391
I knew that it was Donald Decker.

35:52.932 --> 35:57.827
I couldn't believe it, because
I was never anywhere near him.

35:57.828 --> 36:02.688
I was in a total different
area of the jail.

36:03.395 --> 36:07.475
He was behind numerous locked doors.

36:08.505 --> 36:12.645
It's just... it's humanly impossible.

36:20.450 --> 36:25.790
But you could just sense
it, and you could feel it.

36:26.846 --> 36:29.666
Don was possessed.

36:36.466 --> 36:38.705
Everybody was frightened.

36:38.706 --> 36:39.903
Don?

36:39.904 --> 36:41.216
It's time.

36:41.217 --> 36:46.557
You just felt sick to your
stomach being around him.

36:50.245 --> 36:54.085
I did not want to look at him.

36:54.594 --> 36:58.387
I really did not want to look
in his eyes, truthfully.

36:58.388 --> 37:01.891
I did not want to be near him.

37:01.892 --> 37:04.125
I knew that...

37:04.126 --> 37:07.126
That something evil...

37:07.220 --> 37:10.100
Was possessing him.

37:10.922 --> 37:14.099
And I knew that nobody could fix it...

37:14.100 --> 37:17.340
Except maybe a minister.

37:24.548 --> 37:27.428
The only solution...

37:27.710 --> 37:30.890
Was to do an exorcism.

37:50.413 --> 37:53.282
We brought Donald Decker to the closet,

37:53.283 --> 37:58.203
a common area that was
outside the cell block.

37:59.143 --> 38:03.523
Reverend Blackburn was the jail Chaplain.

38:20.064 --> 38:22.298
I met the priest.

38:22.299 --> 38:27.339
He told me he was going
to perform an exorcism.

38:27.738 --> 38:31.342
And get rid of whatever
was around me, you know?

38:31.343 --> 38:35.378
What was causing all these bad things.

38:35.379 --> 38:41.079
I basically sat down and sat
in a chair and just waited.

38:42.736 --> 38:45.112
Waiting to see...

38:45.113 --> 38:50.335
What was gonna happen when the
reverend came out of those doors.

38:50.336 --> 38:54.370
He grabbed my hand, and then he
started reading from the Bible.

38:54.371 --> 38:57.663
In the name of our Lord, Jesus
Christ, we cast you out,

38:57.664 --> 39:00.604
every unclean spirit, every devilish power.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.307
And then...

39:02.308 --> 39:06.808
This real strong odor came into the room.

39:07.011 --> 39:12.911
The more and more the priest
talked, the stronger the odor got.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.367
Like rotting flesh.

39:14.368 --> 39:15.925
[Coughs]

39:15.926 --> 39:18.954
Cunning serpent, to
deceive the human race...

39:18.955 --> 39:21.725
Persecute the church of God...

39:21.726 --> 39:24.366
[Dramatic music]

39:25.363 --> 39:28.183
All of a sudden...

39:29.957 --> 39:32.837
It started raining.

39:35.682 --> 39:37.874
Depart from this mortal being.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.060
Depart, and leave the soul intact.

39:40.061 --> 39:42.611
Stay far away from the church of God.

39:42.612 --> 39:44.435
There was an anticipation...

39:44.436 --> 39:46.802
Those made in the image of God.

39:46.803 --> 39:48.842
Of what is happening.

39:48.843 --> 39:52.127
And redeemed by the precious
blood of the divine lamb.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.026
I never saw the liquid...

39:54.027 --> 39:56.010
Assault by the infernal adversary.

39:56.011 --> 39:58.245
As intense as it was in that room.

39:58.246 --> 40:01.382
God the Father, God the Son, and God the...

40:01.383 --> 40:05.070
The water wasn't hitting me.
It was just attacking him.

40:05.071 --> 40:07.561
To persecute the church of God,

40:07.562 --> 40:10.296
or to strike the chosen of
God or sift them like wheat.

40:10.297 --> 40:12.050
Be gone!

40:12.051 --> 40:14.616
But it would never hit the Bible.

40:14.617 --> 40:17.862
Depart and leave the soul intact.

40:17.863 --> 40:20.446
The priest was talking very, very loudly.

40:20.447 --> 40:24.051
- God the Holy Ghost commands you.
- Screaming at whatever was inside of me.

40:24.052 --> 40:29.952
Go now, spirits, back to the
gates of hell, where you belong.

40:30.997 --> 40:33.997
For I exorcise thee.

40:38.667 --> 40:42.327
The odor was becoming intense.

40:44.113 --> 40:46.813
I smelled death.

40:55.637 --> 40:58.457
[Music intensifies]

41:11.121 --> 41:12.921
No!

41:13.922 --> 41:16.082
[Yelling]

41:21.243 --> 41:23.845
Let me out of here.

41:23.846 --> 41:27.926
Open the door! Let me out of here!

41:32.152 --> 41:37.662
What I saw back then was
evil, and it was a darkness.

41:37.663 --> 41:41.983
It was something that was unexplainable.

41:48.574 --> 41:51.634
I opened up my eyes.

41:54.681 --> 41:58.401
I was hoping it was all over.

42:19.933 --> 42:21.800
It never happened again.

42:21.801 --> 42:24.561
It was all over.

42:26.473 --> 42:31.933
I think I survived something
that was life-threatening.

42:35.282 --> 42:40.086
I think my grandfather
caused all this, so, um...

42:40.087 --> 42:45.418
He hurt me when I was growing up,
tried to hurt me after his death.

42:45.419 --> 42:48.299
So now it's over.

42:50.205 --> 42:52.905
He can't touch me anymore.

42:52.906 --> 42:58.806
