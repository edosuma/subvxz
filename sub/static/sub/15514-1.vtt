23:08.488 --> 23:11.023
I COULD HAVE LOST
MY JOB, ASSHOLE!

23:12.224 --> 23:13.993
DON'T GET SENTIMENTAL.

25:51.751 --> 25:54.120
WHO'S THAT, SHERIFF?

25:56.155 --> 25:59.158
HE'S NOT IN OUR JAIL.

25:59.191 --> 26:02.662

26:16.042 --> 26:19.245

26:19.278 --> 26:22.615
DON'T YOU CARE
ABOUT YOUR PAPERWORK?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.018
SHERIFF, I'M NOT, UH...

26:26.052 --> 26:29.155

WHO YOU MEAN.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.358
LOOK AT YOUR FACE, SON.

26:32.391 --> 26:35.227
SOMEBODY MARKED IT UP
WHEN YOU WAS ON DUTY.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.264
WHEN ON DUTY,
YOU REPRESENT ME.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.134
YES, SIR.

26:42.168 --> 26:46.773
WHO MARKED YOU UP WHILE
YOU WAS REPRESENTING ME?

HAS GOT NERVE.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.242
JESUS CHRIST

27:23.275 --> 27:25.912
THAT'S A BREACH
OF PROFESSIONAL ETIQUETTE.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.914
COMING WITHOUT CALLING ME?

27:27.947 --> 27:31.884
PULLING A SURPRISE INSPECTION
WITHOUT LETTING ME KNOW?

27:31.918 --> 27:33.753
A BREACH OF ETIQUETTE.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.155
I AIN'T AFRAID OF HIM.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.225
I'LL GET ME
A MEAT CLEAVER.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.161
I'LL BREACH

27:51.738 --> 27:53.973
SERGEANT MAJOR CAREY?

27:54.006 --> 27:55.975
THIS IS
A BREACH OF ETIQUETTE.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.044
I WON'T TAKE THIS.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.446
THIS IS MY MESS HALL.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.715
KEEP YOUR NOSE OUT.

28:02.749 --> 28:05.251
27 YEARS I BEEN

28:05.284 --> 28:07.153
EISENHOWER ATE MY COOKING.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.856
I WON'T STAND
FOR NO SURPRISE INSPECTIONS.

28:09.889 --> 28:13.993
SERGEANT, I CAME IN HERE
BECAUSE THE FOOD
SMELLED GOOD,

28:14.026 --> 28:15.995
I WANTED TO
EAT WITH SOLDIERS,

28:16.028 --> 28:18.164
NOT AT THE N.C.O.
COUNTRY CLUB.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.166
THE FOOD'S EXCELLENT.
IT IS EXCELLENT.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.402
PLACE IS CLEAN.
I RUN A CLEAN MESS.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.371
NOBODY SLOPS
THE FOOD.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.007
SERVED WITH
PRIDE, RESPECT.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.043
NOBODY BETTER
SLOP MY FOOD!

28:31.077 --> 28:35.114

AND YOUR ENTIRE STAFF.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.383

THAT APPLE COBBLER?

28:37.416 --> 28:39.018
I WAS GOING TO.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.922
TASTE THAT,
THEN YOU TALK
ABOUT MY FOOD.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.431
SERGEANT.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.300
YEAH?

28:54.333 --> 28:57.369
BEST FUCKING
APPLE COBBLER
I EVER TASTED.

29:01.007 --> 29:03.075
GIVE THAT MAN SECONDS!

29:47.086 --> 29:48.454
MORNING, SARAH.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.057
MORNING, SHERIFF.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.826
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN WONDER WOMAN?

29:55.094 --> 29:56.562
WHO?

29:56.595 --> 30:00.066
WONDER WOMAN, LIKE ON TV.
DO YOU BELIEVE IN HER?

30:01.367 --> 30:03.069
NO, SIR.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.071
WELL, NOW, THAT'S GOOD.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.573
HOW ABOUT
THE LONE RANGER?

30:07.606 --> 30:11.610
IS THERE REALLY A LONE RANGER,
LIKE IN THE COMICS?

30:11.643 --> 30:15.281
SHERIFF, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.217
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION,
SISTER SARAH.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.920
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN THE LONE RANGER?

30:20.953 --> 30:23.289
NO, SIR.

30:23.322 --> 30:27.293
AH, LIAR, LIAR,
PANTS ON FIRE!

30:27.326 --> 30:31.063
YOU THINK THE LONE RANGER
WEARS ARMY GREEN.

30:31.097 --> 30:34.833
THAT'S DANGEROUS
FOR A LADY IN YOUR POSITION.

30:37.369 --> 30:41.173
YOU DO BUSINESS WITH
THEM PEOPLE, OF COURSE.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.608
BUT THAT'S ALL.

30:42.641 --> 30:45.211
DON'T GET
PERSONAL WITH THEM.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.313
THEY AIN'T OUR KIND.

30:47.346 --> 30:51.083
THAT'S A LESSON
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN.
YOU GOT TO LEARN IT GOOD.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.120
SO...

30:55.922 --> 30:58.190
PULL UP YOUR
LITTLE SHIRT.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.192
TAKE DOWN
YOUR DRAWERS.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.629
TURN OVER.
GET TO IT.

31:05.631 --> 31:08.200
I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU

31:08.234 --> 31:10.970
THERE REALLY AIN'T
NO LONE RANGER.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.050
I GOT THIS ONE.

32:03.355 --> 32:06.625
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE PROVOST MARSHAL.

32:06.658 --> 32:09.628
HE'S NOT IN.
CAN I HELP?

32:09.661 --> 32:11.630
WELL,
MAYBE YOU CAN.

32:11.663 --> 32:15.334
I BET YOU KNOW
WHO HE IS.

32:15.367 --> 32:19.205
HE'S A MASTER SERGEANT,
OR SOME SUCH THING.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.107
FIRST NAME'S ZACK.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.710
HE'S WANTED FOR
BATTERY ON MY DEPUTY,

32:24.743 --> 32:28.180
AND WHATEVER ELSE
I CAN THINK OF.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.615
LOOK NO FURTHER.

32:29.648 --> 32:32.551
WE GOT HIM.
I WANT HIM.

32:32.584 --> 32:36.155
HE TURNED HIMSELF
IN TO THE MPs
LAST NIGHT.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.625
HE'LL BE SORRY
WHEN WE GET THROUGH.

32:39.658 --> 32:43.429
HOW MUCH WILL
HE HAVE TO PAY?

32:43.462 --> 32:45.164
HE'LL PAY, ALL RIGHT.

32:45.197 --> 32:49.635
FIRST, HE'LL SPEND
TIME IN MY JAIL.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.639
IT'S LUCKY WE GOT
A CHANCE TO TALK.

32:53.672 --> 32:57.343
I'LL SAVE YOU ALL
KINDS OF PAPERWORK.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.579
YOU'RE AWARE OF THE
SUPREME COURT DECISION,

33:20.499 --> 33:22.134
YES, SIR.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.137

33:27.273 --> 33:31.110

WITH YOUR TOWN.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.712
I'LL HAVE HIM
IN 15 MINUTES.

33:33.745 --> 33:35.747
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.

33:35.781 --> 33:38.650
IF YOU
WANT HIM THAT BAD,

33:38.684 --> 33:42.088
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
