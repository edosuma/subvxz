Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.099 --> 00:12.080
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.099 --> 00:15.019
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.039 --> 00:16.190
They were good.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.050
[music continues]

00:22.100 --> 00:26.120
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.140 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.089
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.120 --> 00:34.030
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.049 --> 00:36.070
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.090 --> 00:38.100
[evil laugh]

00:38.119 --> 00:39.140
Oh!

00:39.159 --> 00:41.079
Oh, I'll get you!

'I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.'

00:44.159 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.049 --> 00:51.070
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.170
And if you are good
you may just

00:53.189 --> 00:57.020
catch a glimpse of the Smurfs.

- What?
- Eee! Oh, Clumsy.

01:19.210 --> 01:22.230
Uh, why's everybody
laying down on the job?

01:23.010 --> 01:26.109
(Papa Smurf)
The new garden path
looks very smurfy, Handy.

01:26.129 --> 01:30.039
Yes, every Smurf is smurfing
a good job, Papa Smurf.

01:30.060 --> 01:32.020
(Greedy)
'Ow! Clumsy.'

01:32.039 --> 01:35.109
Uh, that is,
almost every Smurf.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.140
Clumsy, knock it off.

01:37.159 --> 01:39.090
Uh, okay, Hefty.

01:42.079 --> 01:44.049
[all groaning]

01:44.069 --> 01:47.170
Uh, Clumsy, why don't you
go round up some more rocks

01:47.189 --> 01:49.140
and let us do the hammering?

01:49.159 --> 01:51.030
Oh, you bet, Papa Smurf.

01:51.049 --> 01:53.189
I'll be back in a jiffy
with some more rocks.

01:55.099 --> 01:59.079
Uh, no rocks here
and no rocks there.

01:59.099 --> 02:00.209

Here's a whole bunch of rocks.

02:08.139 --> 02:11.139
They're kind of funny-looking,
but they ought to do the job.

02:11.159 --> 02:13.069
[humming]

02:19.210 --> 02:21.180
How humiliating.

02:21.199 --> 02:23.219
We've been Smurf hunting
all day

02:24.000 --> 02:27.069
and not one little
blue hide to show for it.

02:27.090 --> 02:30.099

and skunk-cabbage soup

would come our way for a change.

02:45.180 --> 02:49.000
Here's another one.
And another. And another.

02:49.020 --> 02:51.139
Someone must have dropped these.

02:51.159 --> 02:53.180
That means there must be more,
lots more.

02:53.199 --> 02:57.180
Come, Azrael, start looking.
This is our lucky day.

02:57.199 --> 02:59.069

03:03.080 --> 03:06.229
Oh, hey, Smurfs.
I got lots of rocks for you.

What kind of rocks are those?

03:09.080 --> 03:12.050
They're so pale.
Are they sick?

Oh, well, a rock is a rock

It turned to dust.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.219
Oh, Clumsy,
these rocks are useless.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.129
Yeah. Smurf them back
where they came from

03:36.150 --> 03:38.159
and get us some good rocks.

03:38.180 --> 03:42.030
Gosh, I can't do anything right.

03:42.050 --> 03:46.199

diamonds anywhere, Azrael.

W-w-what treasure?

04:33.079 --> 04:35.199
I-I-I was
just dumping some old rocks.

Um, are there
more of these old rocks?

Where'd they go?

05:33.069 --> 05:35.060
I must have their diamonds.

05:35.079 --> 05:38.170
And I will have their diamonds.

05:38.189 --> 05:42.110
Yes, yes, the Smurfs
will gladly give them to me

05:42.129 --> 05:44.079

the diamonds, Mr. Gargamel.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.220
You've brought them.
Ah, my little pretties.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.169
Very well. And now,
for your payment.

11:37.190 --> 11:39.190
(all)
It's empty.

11:39.210 --> 11:40.220
Not anymore.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.220
(Smurfs)
'Help! Help!'

11:43.000 --> 11:45.220
I was afraid of this,
so I came prepared.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.220
Mighty magic, smurf my spell.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.159
Save your breath, Papa Smurf.
It's too late.

11:52.179 --> 11:56.029
(Papa Smurf)
'Mighty magic, smurf my spell.'

11:56.049 --> 11:59.029
'Hear me now and all is well.'

11:59.049 --> 12:00.090
[chiming]

12:01.110 --> 12:03.120
splash

12:03.139 --> 12:07.200
At last, Azrael,
we're rich. Rich.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.210
(Papa Smurf)
I wouldn't be too sure
of that, Gargamel.

12:10.230 --> 12:14.159
Uh, uh, Smurfs.
But-but where are my diamonds?

12:14.179 --> 12:18.159
In the other bag, thanks
to a quick magical switch.

12:20.129 --> 12:23.110
No. Oh, no.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.149
Oh, Papa Smurf, we're sorry

12:29.169 --> 12:32.120
for listening
to that bad wizard and not you.

12:32.139 --> 12:35.029
But he did seem nice
for a while.

12:35.049 --> 12:39.039
Well, it just proves there are
some people you can't trust

12:39.059 --> 12:41.000
no matter what they say.

12:41.019 --> 12:42.230
Exactly, Papa Smurf.

12:43.009 --> 12:45.009
In other words,
don't smurf candy

12:45.029 --> 12:47.120
from strangers
or strange wizards.

12:47.139 --> 12:49.059
Or, as I always say

12:49.080 --> 12:51.220
"Beware a wizard
in sheep's clothing."

12:53.179 --> 12:55.009
boing

12:58.179 --> 13:01.029
