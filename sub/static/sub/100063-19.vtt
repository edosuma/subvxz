White Knight to Little Bird.

00:18.147 --> 00:19.191
Little Bird, you there?

00:19.215 --> 00:20.592
Go ahead, White Knight.

00:20.616 --> 00:22.594
Okay, so don't judge, but

00:22.618 --> 00:24.525
we're blown. They know we're here.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.170
- Can you get to the exfil point?
- Negative.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.112
Then we're gonna
have to improvise exfil.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.923
What's your position? Give me a mark.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.426
You may want to close your eyes.

Magnum,
my neck hasn't been the same

00:47.964 --> 00:49.975
since you pulled that... crazy move.

00:49.999 --> 00:51.644
I think you meant to say,

00:51.668 --> 00:53.746
"Thank you, Magnum, for saving my life."

00:53.770 --> 00:55.481
Come on, Kim. Give that man a break.

00:55.505 --> 00:56.549
He had to wing it.

00:56.573 --> 00:59.312
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Higgy!

00:59.336 --> 01:01.087
Kim, hey, uh, this is
my partner, Juliet Higgins.

01:01.111 --> 01:02.822
Actually, scratch that.

01:02.846 --> 01:05.491
This is, uh, TC's fiancée,
Juliet Higgins.

01:05.515 --> 01:07.226
It's lovely to meet you.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.760
Nice to meet you, too.

01:08.784 --> 01:09.816
Yo.

01:17.613 --> 01:18.829
We cool?

01:19.542 --> 01:21.107
Yeah, we're cool.

01:21.131 --> 01:22.308
I don't know, man.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.876
It just seems like you icing me

01:23.900 --> 01:25.911
for gettin' fake married to Higgy.

01:25.935 --> 01:26.979
Thought you were okay with it.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.147
I'm okay with it.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.682
You don't seem okay.

01:29.706 --> 01:30.838
I'm fine.

01:31.405 --> 01:33.319
Okay. It was my idea

01:33.343 --> 01:35.154
to get married and save her
from that whole visa issue

01:35.178 --> 01:36.856
and you kind of stole that idea...

01:36.880 --> 01:38.257
And you're lucky that we did.

01:38.281 --> 01:39.925
'Cause the only reason why she's
getting married to anybody

01:39.949 --> 01:41.427
is to save your business.

01:41.451 --> 01:42.962
I just thought it made sense, you know?

01:42.986 --> 01:44.830
We... work together,

01:44.854 --> 01:46.799
we live together at Robin's Nest.

01:46.823 --> 01:48.534
It just... It ain't real.

01:48.558 --> 01:50.936
Time is running out for her,
she asked me,

01:50.960 --> 01:53.172
and she's like my little sister,
so I said "okay."

01:53.196 --> 01:55.074
Guys, when you're finished
fighting over me,

01:55.098 --> 01:57.124
Magnum, perhaps you can tell
me about your client meeting

01:57.148 --> 01:58.255
this morning.

01:58.735 --> 02:00.713
She's a divorce mediator.

02:00.737 --> 02:03.082
Uh, one of the best
on the island, actually.

02:03.106 --> 02:04.884
If you and TC ever hit a rough patch,

02:04.908 --> 02:06.185
you should probably give her a call.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.354
All right, Magnum, yeah,
I'll keep that in mind. Look,

02:08.377 --> 02:10.021
you know the reason I
asked TC to marry me

02:10.045 --> 02:11.457
is 'cause I thought that

02:11.481 --> 02:15.227
our fake marriage would get in
the way of our real partnership.

02:15.251 --> 02:16.862
Married couples work together
all the time.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.164
It's not an issue.

02:18.188 --> 02:19.965
Well, clearly it is.

02:19.989 --> 02:21.634
Tell me about the job.

02:21.658 --> 02:24.535
There's a mediator
facilitating a divorce between

02:24.559 --> 02:26.772
this ex-race car driver, John Gilbert,

02:26.796 --> 02:28.107
and his wife Maxine.

02:28.131 --> 02:29.708
Problem is,
she thinks he's been cheating,

02:29.732 --> 02:30.876
he swears he's not.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.645
It's one of those
"he said, she said" scenarios.

02:32.669 --> 02:34.613
So she's having a difficult time

02:34.637 --> 02:36.382
figuring out who's telling the truth.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.050
Okay, well, Hawaii's a no-fault state,

02:38.074 --> 02:40.486
but fault can come into it
when you're dividing assets.

02:40.510 --> 02:42.488
The wife, uh, Maxine,

02:42.512 --> 02:45.357
could get more based on
John's supposed indiscretions.

02:45.381 --> 02:48.160
That's why the mediator
wants to hire two investigators.

02:48.184 --> 02:50.095
So she asked me if I knew another P.I.

02:50.119 --> 02:52.498
- You didn't.
- I did.

02:52.522 --> 02:54.667
I figure we can get paid twice
for the same job.

02:54.691 --> 02:56.602
We'd be working with different spouses,

02:56.626 --> 02:58.204
going against each other.

02:58.228 --> 03:00.406
Yeah, but if I prove my client
wasn't the one lying,

03:00.430 --> 03:01.407
he gets a better settlement.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.608
Yeah, or vice versa.

03:02.632 --> 03:04.065
Or vice versa. So what do you say?

03:07.537 --> 03:08.870
May the best P.I. win.

04:57.607 --> 04:58.584
Oh...

04:58.608 --> 04:59.852
I love dogs.

04:59.876 --> 05:01.687
John never wanted them.

05:01.711 --> 05:03.622
Didn't really like animals.

05:03.646 --> 05:04.923
That's should've been a sign.

05:04.947 --> 05:07.026
Well, surely, your divorce can't be based

05:07.050 --> 05:08.827
on your different views about pets.

05:09.899 --> 05:11.056
No.

05:11.085 --> 05:12.831
John and I have been, um...

05:12.855 --> 05:15.100
drifting apart for a while.

05:15.124 --> 05:17.670
Arguing more than usual.

05:17.694 --> 05:19.694
But, uh...

05:21.330 --> 05:22.708
John's always had options.

05:23.553 --> 05:25.644
He's a good-looking guy, he races cars.

05:25.668 --> 05:27.713
Women just threw themselves at him.

05:28.141 --> 05:29.870
You believe he was unfaithful?

05:32.975 --> 05:34.820
When did you become suspicious?

05:35.440 --> 05:40.092
First, he started disappearing
at odd hours of the night.

05:40.116 --> 05:42.795
Lying about working late.

05:43.323 --> 05:46.331
Then money started disappearing
from our account.

05:47.118 --> 05:49.902
That's when I found actual proof
on our PaceTracker.

05:49.926 --> 05:52.852
I... Sorry, I don't follow.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.908
We share a fitness app
that tracks our health...

05:55.932 --> 05:58.077
steps, heart rate, all that.

05:58.101 --> 05:59.278
And, well,

05:59.302 --> 06:01.447
I can be a bit competitive.

06:01.471 --> 06:04.049
So I logged in just to see
who was doing better and...

06:04.073 --> 06:07.186
that's when I, uh...

06:07.210 --> 06:08.454
I saw it.

06:08.851 --> 06:10.617
Saw what?

06:12.849 --> 06:14.093
John,

06:14.117 --> 06:16.729
sneaking out in the middle of the night.

06:16.753 --> 06:19.398
The worst part is, his...

06:19.422 --> 06:22.601
heart rate would spike
when he was with someone else.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.436
I could literally see

06:24.460 --> 06:27.200
the moment that he was cheating on me.

06:28.631 --> 06:29.942
We met on the mainland.

06:29.966 --> 06:32.411
I was running stock at first,
then switched to open wheel.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.948
After my fourth concussion,
the docs said I had to retire.

06:35.972 --> 06:39.051
After that happened,
Maxine wanted to move back here,

06:39.075 --> 06:40.452
be closer to family.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.088
And I went along with it.

06:43.112 --> 06:44.857
Doesn't sound like you were
too thrilled about that.

06:44.881 --> 06:47.993
Most of my family's in Tennessee.

06:48.305 --> 06:50.763
Max never appreciated
the sacrifice I made

06:50.787 --> 06:52.331
moving back here.

06:53.643 --> 06:55.501
That choice, that was all about her.

06:55.525 --> 06:57.236
Her needs.

06:57.606 --> 07:00.506
She didn't want me racing
after my first accident.

07:01.109 --> 07:03.408
She never understood
that I had to do this.

07:03.432 --> 07:05.511
It was just who I am.

07:06.573 --> 07:09.148
Maybe she was just worried
you'd really hurt yourself.

07:09.172 --> 07:11.083
Occupational hazard.

07:11.453 --> 07:12.618
If she didn't want me racing,

07:12.642 --> 07:14.164
she shouldn't have married a driver.

07:15.711 --> 07:17.756
Look, this island is paradise...

07:17.780 --> 07:20.425
heaven, for some people...
but it's been hell for me.

07:20.449 --> 07:23.362
Moving back here isolated me
from friends and family.

07:23.386 --> 07:25.800
Took me out of the racing world entirely.

07:27.390 --> 07:30.068
I don't mean to be blunt, but, um...

07:30.092 --> 07:31.570
your wife thinks
you've been cheating on her.

07:31.594 --> 07:33.806
I know what she's saying,
but it ain't true.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.008
I never cheated on her, not once.

07:36.603 --> 07:38.043
I'd never do that.

07:39.105 --> 07:40.379
Look, you gotta believe me,

07:40.403 --> 07:42.614
I would never hurt Maxine like that.

07:42.638 --> 07:44.817
If anything, I think
she's the one who's cheating.

07:45.521 --> 07:47.053
Why do you say that?

07:47.977 --> 07:50.489
A month ago, I went to visit her at work.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.191
She was gone. Nobody knew where she was.

07:52.215 --> 07:53.992
Later, I asked her about it

07:54.016 --> 07:56.495
and she said it was
a doctor's appointment,

07:56.873 --> 07:58.385
but I could tell she was lying.

08:01.421 --> 08:02.935
All I'm saying is
I don't think the guy cheated.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.102
That's fair.

08:04.126 --> 08:05.504
And I'm telling you
that my client has evidence

08:05.528 --> 08:07.105
- that indicates otherwise.
- Also fair.

08:07.129 --> 08:08.907
- What kind of evidence?
- Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

08:08.931 --> 08:10.350
Yes, I would like to know,
that's why I'm asking.

08:10.384 --> 08:12.595
Well, too bad, because it's
privileged client information.

08:12.623 --> 08:13.686
Whatever.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.872
Your client's just spinning a web

08:15.902 --> 08:17.467
because she's probably the
one who's been cheating.

08:17.491 --> 08:19.369
- Well, I guess we'll see.
- Yes, we will.

08:19.393 --> 08:20.470
That's what I just said.

08:20.494 --> 08:22.772
And I am agreeing with you.

08:22.796 --> 08:25.819
The way you two bicker,
you might as well be married.

08:26.926 --> 08:28.945
Hey, Kumu, I have a meeting to get to,

08:28.969 --> 08:30.480
but could you help me
make some phone calls?

08:30.504 --> 08:32.414
Oh, I'd love to, Thomas,

08:32.438 --> 08:35.852
but Juliet already asked me to
help plan her wedding on Friday.

08:35.876 --> 08:37.053
Maybe try TC or Rick.

08:37.077 --> 08:39.277
Wait, I-I reached out,
but no one's picking up.

08:46.887 --> 08:48.498
- I
- just need you to tail him.

08:48.522 --> 08:49.921
Do some simple surveillance?

08:51.758 --> 08:53.669
Hello? Hey, Shammy.

08:53.693 --> 08:55.571
- How you doing, man?
- Magnum, hey.

08:55.595 --> 08:56.873
Listen, I got Higgy on the other line.

08:56.897 --> 08:58.508
I gotta call you back, okay?

08:58.532 --> 09:00.510
Peace.

09:00.534 --> 09:03.179
You can't take Kumu and Shammy.

09:03.203 --> 09:05.081
All right,
so you're gonna send me the location

09:05.105 --> 09:06.249
- and all the deets?
- Yeah.

09:06.273 --> 09:07.617
Just call me
if you have any updates, okay?

09:07.641 --> 09:10.420
- You got it.
- Thanks, Shammy, you're the best.

09:10.444 --> 09:11.954
What is Shammy even doing for you?

09:11.978 --> 09:13.956
Um, sorry. That's privileged.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.058
Well, whatever.

09:15.082 --> 09:16.793
I got a lot of friends.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.094
Oh, really?

09:18.118 --> 09:20.029
Well, if Rick and TC aren't answering,

09:20.053 --> 09:23.099
then who else could you possibly
have to call for help?

09:23.123 --> 09:24.500
Why would I hack
into this person's phone?

09:24.524 --> 09:25.501
What's this even for?

09:25.525 --> 09:26.702
A case.

09:26.726 --> 09:28.104
You know I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

09:28.128 --> 09:30.473
I don't know that. At all.

09:30.497 --> 09:33.076
Besides, isn't this a Higgins thing?

09:33.100 --> 09:34.811
Well, uh... we're kind of

09:34.835 --> 09:36.813
working with opposing clients right now.

09:36.837 --> 09:40.216
So you're admitting
that you're useless without her.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.451
No, I didn't say that.

09:41.475 --> 09:42.552
Maybe you should.

09:42.896 --> 09:44.921
Is that what it would take
for you to help me?

09:44.945 --> 09:46.149
Wouldn't hurt.

09:47.180 --> 09:48.958
Okay. Fine.

09:48.982 --> 09:50.026
I am, uh...

09:50.612 --> 09:52.395
kind of useless...

09:52.419 --> 09:53.629
Without...

09:53.653 --> 09:56.332
Without Higgins.

09:56.356 --> 09:58.756
Now, all together.

10:00.393 --> 10:01.871
I'm kind of useless
without Higgins. There.

10:01.895 --> 10:03.439
Can you just help me, please?

10:03.463 --> 10:04.841
Sorry, no can do without a warrant.

10:04.865 --> 10:05.942
Have a good one, Magnum.

10:05.966 --> 10:06.998
I...

10:08.702 --> 10:10.298
Ah...

10:10.871 --> 10:13.783
Thomas, I'm looking for Juliet's laptop.

10:13.807 --> 10:15.785
Any idea where it is?

10:15.809 --> 10:17.487
Haven't seen it.

10:17.511 --> 10:18.658
Why am I not surprised?

10:18.682 --> 10:19.692
First,
what you want to do

10:19.716 --> 10:21.157
is assess the network security

10:21.181 --> 10:23.793
of the account or device
that you are hacking into.

10:23.817 --> 10:25.661
What are you up to?

10:25.685 --> 10:27.697
Trying to get into Maxine's Google Drive.

10:27.721 --> 10:30.032
"A Dummies Guide to Hacking"?

10:30.056 --> 10:32.301
You're kidding.
That kid's, like, 11 years old.

10:32.325 --> 10:35.071
That kid is Artimus277 and he's a genius.

10:35.095 --> 10:37.495
Every bit as good of a hacker
as Higgins is.

10:39.057 --> 10:40.476
...and then check to see

10:40.500 --> 10:41.878
if they've enabled two-factored security.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.235
Here, you can see this site...

10:47.979 --> 10:49.685
You know, I bet if I asked Higgins...

10:49.709 --> 10:51.187
No, no, no. Don't do that.

10:51.211 --> 10:53.244
Just... tell her
you couldn't find her laptop.

10:54.447 --> 10:55.625
Please?

10:55.649 --> 10:56.893
Okay.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.050
You got 20 minutes. Good luck.

11:09.596 --> 11:12.708
Juliet Higgins and Associates.

11:12.732 --> 11:13.876
Really?

11:13.900 --> 11:15.211
It's just something I'm trying out.

11:15.235 --> 11:18.080
I actually think it has
a rather nice ring to it.

11:18.104 --> 11:19.815
Hey, listen, I found
some fascinating information

11:19.839 --> 11:22.118
- on your client.
- Oh, great.

11:22.142 --> 11:25.321
All it took was the use
of my laptop without permission

11:25.345 --> 11:27.023
and the help of an 11-year-old boy.

11:27.047 --> 11:28.724
Hold on, Kumu gave me up?

11:28.748 --> 11:31.194
It's called a search history, Magnum.

11:31.218 --> 11:32.461
And by the way, just because

11:32.485 --> 11:33.729
you're sharing information with me

11:33.753 --> 11:35.231
doesn't mean I'll return the favor.

11:35.255 --> 11:38.189
You know, I don't need
any pro to your quid, Higgins.

11:39.226 --> 11:41.938
That's not how Latin works, Magnum.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.154
What did you find?

11:43.178 --> 11:44.907
All right, so, I was
going through Maxine's

11:44.931 --> 11:46.609
old text messages on her phone

11:46.633 --> 11:48.878
and found a number that wasn't saved.

11:48.902 --> 11:51.214
"I got your message,
I'm definitely down to meet

11:51.238 --> 11:53.849
"when John's out of town. Pat."

11:53.873 --> 11:55.685
It's not exactly a smoking gun.

11:55.709 --> 11:58.221
No, but it does cast doubt
on your client.

11:58.245 --> 12:00.289
Maybe she's not the victim
she's making herself out to be.

12:00.313 --> 12:03.426
Magnum, Pat is an androgynous
name. It could be anyone.

12:03.450 --> 12:06.796
A girlfriend, her personal trainer.

12:06.820 --> 12:10.121
Or the guy she's having an affair with.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.162
First order of
business here is to find out

12:19.187 --> 12:20.632
who Pat the hugger is.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.368
Normally, I'd just run his plates,

12:22.392 --> 12:25.893
but the guy took an Uber here,
so time for a plan B.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.476
Can I help you?

12:30.500 --> 12:31.644
Hey. Hey,

12:31.668 --> 12:33.612
these, uh, pies look amazing.

12:33.636 --> 12:34.880
How's this pecan?

12:34.904 --> 12:36.549
You like pecans?

12:36.573 --> 12:38.017
Yeah.

12:38.041 --> 12:41.086
It's like that, except in pie form.

12:41.110 --> 12:43.222
Okay.

12:43.246 --> 12:44.845
Maybe I'll let the wife decide.

12:56.626 --> 12:57.770
Now,

12:57.794 --> 12:58.871
don't be mad.

12:58.895 --> 13:00.039
I didn't know how long

13:00.063 --> 13:01.507
it was gonna take you guys to get here,

13:01.531 --> 13:03.464
so I put him in the fridge.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.412
You should have left
the body where it was.

13:06.436 --> 13:09.048
That's what I was worried about.
This could all be ruined.

13:09.072 --> 13:11.817
Everybody knows cold helps
preserve bodies.

13:11.841 --> 13:13.352
I'm talking about all that food.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.420
Don't nobody want no mangos that's been

13:14.444 --> 13:15.821
chilling next to some dead dude.

13:15.845 --> 13:17.756
I'll eat those mangos. I'll eat
those... I don't have any problem

13:17.780 --> 13:19.692
with those mangoes at all.
In fact, I would prefer...

13:19.716 --> 13:22.061
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Either
of you know who this guy was?

13:22.085 --> 13:24.063
No, no. He wasn't a regular

13:24.087 --> 13:25.664
and he didn't have any ID in his pockets.

13:25.688 --> 13:28.867
The only thing he had was, uh,
some cash and some receipts.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.203
Although one of the servers
did say that he was gonna

13:31.227 --> 13:32.438
order just one more drink

13:32.462 --> 13:34.306
'cause he had to get back to Suzy?

13:34.330 --> 13:35.608
So at least we have a name.

13:35.632 --> 13:37.242
Yeah. And dead dude
didn't have on a ring,

13:37.266 --> 13:39.278
so maybe Suzy's a girlfriend?

13:39.302 --> 13:40.779
Maybe.

13:40.803 --> 13:42.436
Thanks for your help.
We'll take it from here.

13:44.107 --> 13:47.753
So, you'll let his family know?

13:47.777 --> 13:49.521
There's not a lot to go on here.

13:49.545 --> 13:51.890
I mean, if his prints or DNA
aren't in the system,

13:51.914 --> 13:53.092
it's gonna be hard getting an ID.

13:53.116 --> 13:54.126
And with a million-plus people
on the island,

13:54.150 --> 13:55.970
it might take weeks to narrow down.

13:56.004 --> 13:57.201
That's if he's a local.

13:57.230 --> 13:59.798
If not, he may never be identified.

13:59.822 --> 14:03.035
Well, maybe this Suzy person
might come back looking for him.

14:03.373 --> 14:04.637
Let's hope so.

14:04.661 --> 14:06.038
What if she doesn't?

14:06.062 --> 14:08.107
I mean, what if nobody comes
for him? What then?

14:08.131 --> 14:11.076
Well, he'll be buried
in an unmarked grave.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.425
It's a sad end to anybody's life.

14:14.569 --> 14:15.902
Thanks.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.455
Just the person I want to see,

14:23.479 --> 14:25.424
on the computer I want to borrow.

14:26.104 --> 14:27.493
Again?

14:28.148 --> 14:30.162
I need to do a deep dive on Pat.

14:30.186 --> 14:31.497
You know, it's like you've forgotten

14:31.521 --> 14:33.132
- that we're on opposite teams.
- Listen,

14:33.156 --> 14:34.900
you help me, and it will help us

14:34.924 --> 14:36.235
figure out what's going on.

14:36.259 --> 14:39.405
Oh, the old "help me to help you" speech?

14:39.429 --> 14:41.407
I'm sorry, but I'm still on Team Maxine,

14:41.431 --> 14:45.477
despite whatever incendiary hug
you supposedly witnessed.

14:45.501 --> 14:49.214
Okay, there's a hug, right?
And then there's a hug.

14:49.238 --> 14:53.118
And this one is-is loaded, trust me.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.320
Okay. Check it out.

14:55.344 --> 14:57.022
Okay.

14:57.046 --> 14:58.357
It's a tad suspicious.

14:58.804 --> 15:00.292
But actually, it's nothing

15:00.316 --> 15:01.911
compared to what I've discovered.

15:01.964 --> 15:04.630
What, you figured out that I'd
make a better fake husband than TC?

15:04.654 --> 15:06.498
Oh, hardly. The wedding's still on.

15:06.522 --> 15:09.935
Although, I do need a maid
of honor, if you're interested.

15:09.959 --> 15:12.371
Very funny. What'd you find?

15:12.395 --> 15:15.336
So, a credit card

15:15.360 --> 15:18.177
that your client took out
behind my client's back

15:18.201 --> 15:19.778
in order to get cash advances.

15:19.802 --> 15:21.513
Now that is loaded.

15:21.537 --> 15:23.849
It's a good way to pay for hotels,

15:23.873 --> 15:27.453
gifts, travel and all those
other extramarital expenses.

15:27.477 --> 15:29.922
Doesn't make any sense,
but I'm sure, if you give me

15:29.946 --> 15:32.324
your computer, I can figure out
an explanation for it.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.459
That will be a no.

15:33.483 --> 15:34.660
If I want to do a dive

15:34.684 --> 15:37.162
on Pat the Hugger, I'll do it myself.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.665
Fine. But I'm taking my pie with me.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.134
Oh, no, not the pie.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.436
H-Hey, Tatty.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.739
My boy, look at this.

15:46.763 --> 15:49.396
Look at that. Brought you
a little key lime pie.

15:50.647 --> 15:52.377
Looks more like key lime soup.

15:52.401 --> 15:54.418
Yeah, it's been sitting
in the car for a little...

15:54.442 --> 15:55.685
U-Uh-uh.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.195
I like soup.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.184
There you go.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.686
What can I do for you, Magnum?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.755
I-I just need a rundown on a guy.

16:02.779 --> 16:03.922
Pat Lannister.

16:03.946 --> 16:05.390
Pat Lannister?

16:05.414 --> 16:07.726
No need to look him up. I know the name.

16:07.750 --> 16:08.861
Why? Does he have a record?

16:08.885 --> 16:10.362
Nah, he's clean,

16:10.386 --> 16:12.898
but another private dick
was looking into him, too.

16:12.922 --> 16:14.666
Really? You know why?

16:14.690 --> 16:17.703
No, but if you need,
I can get you the P.I.'s info.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.505
Yeah, that'd be great.

16:23.432 --> 16:24.943
What's up, boss?

16:24.967 --> 16:26.578
How's it going with Mr. Gilbert?

16:26.602 --> 16:28.747
Actually, you called at the perfect time.

16:28.771 --> 16:30.082
Things are getting crazy.

16:30.106 --> 16:31.250
Really? What's he up to?

16:31.274 --> 16:32.417
First,

16:32.441 --> 16:34.219
he went to the dry cleaners,

16:34.243 --> 16:35.954
then he went to Zippy's

16:35.978 --> 16:38.357
and got not one,
but two orders of chicken.

16:38.381 --> 16:41.960
And then, get this, he stopped
to throw out some trash.

16:41.984 --> 16:44.148
This P.I. life's pretty sweet.

16:44.172 --> 16:45.864
Okay, I'll admit,
there is a lot of sifting

16:45.888 --> 16:49.034
through dirt,
but sometimes you'll find gold.

16:52.328 --> 16:53.505
Sorry, Shammy, I have to run.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.040
I-I really appreciate you keeping tabs

16:55.064 --> 16:56.408
on, uh, John for me.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.443
And I appreciate you covering my gas.

16:58.467 --> 17:02.581
Wait, Magnum doesn't reimburse
you guys petrol money

17:02.605 --> 17:04.082
for the use of TC's chopper?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.151
Hell no.
That's actually the first time

17:06.175 --> 17:07.953
I've heard "Magnum" and "reimburse"

17:07.977 --> 17:09.421
in the same sentence.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.296
You had me followed?

17:17.319 --> 17:20.566
Uh, no. My partner and I are
working independently on this,

17:20.589 --> 17:23.001
opposite each other. He followed you.

17:23.025 --> 17:24.992
Can you explain?

17:27.829 --> 17:29.997
Pat is, uh...

17:31.767 --> 17:33.412
...John's birth father.

17:33.436 --> 17:35.314
John was adopted,

17:35.338 --> 17:37.649
and his records were unsealed recently.

17:37.673 --> 17:39.985
I thought it would be a good idea for him

17:40.009 --> 17:42.020
to know who his biological parents were.

17:42.044 --> 17:45.257
So, before we decided to divorce,

17:45.281 --> 17:49.628
I... hired a P.I. to track them down.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.285
Behind John's back?

17:52.321 --> 17:53.832
Yeah.

17:53.856 --> 17:55.801
He can be so guarded.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.803
I felt like a lot of our problems stemmed

17:57.827 --> 17:59.638
from issues regarding his adoption.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.608
I thought if he confronted them...

18:02.632 --> 18:05.866
It would help you guys get back on track.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.884
Did he ever meet his dad?

18:12.372 --> 18:17.456
No, which is a shame,
because Pat is a good man.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.957
And I wanted John to know that.

18:18.981 --> 18:20.781
Seems like you still do.

18:23.219 --> 18:26.178
Our marriage might be over, but...

18:27.223 --> 18:29.390
I still care about him.

18:33.062 --> 18:35.140
Hey, is this TC's future wife

18:35.164 --> 18:36.475
Juliet Calvin?

18:36.499 --> 18:38.577
I'm keeping my name, Magnum.

18:38.601 --> 18:40.212
I just thought you'd like to know

18:40.236 --> 18:43.181
that you were completely wrong
about Maxine having an affair.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.583
What'd you find out?

18:44.607 --> 18:45.808
Sorry. That's privileged client...

18:45.848 --> 18:46.885
Information.

18:46.909 --> 18:48.720
Right, right, right. Okay, let me guess.

18:48.744 --> 18:51.857
Pat was my client's father,
who Maxine was trying to locate

18:51.881 --> 18:53.825
in an effort to repair
their relationship.

18:53.849 --> 18:55.394
How did you know?

18:55.418 --> 18:57.829
I talked to the P.I. that Maxine hired,

18:57.853 --> 18:59.865
and he was surprisingly indiscreet.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.167
Tough to find a good
investigator these days.

19:02.191 --> 19:04.603
Yeah, you know, a-another
takeaway is that I think

19:04.627 --> 19:06.271
Maxine actually still loves John.

19:06.295 --> 19:07.773
That's not your takeaway,

19:07.797 --> 19:09.808
that's my takeaway. I figured that out.

19:09.832 --> 19:11.076
Yeah, because I just told you.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.345
Uh...

19:13.975 --> 19:15.414
Whatever. I have to go.

19:15.438 --> 19:17.249
One of my team is on the other line.

19:17.273 --> 19:19.373
You know, these were my friends first...

19:20.409 --> 19:21.720
Shammy.

19:21.744 --> 19:22.955
You were right, Higgins.

19:22.979 --> 19:24.189
I struck gold.

19:24.213 --> 19:25.857
I followed John to Kalihi Kai.

19:25.881 --> 19:28.093
He's meeting up
with two shady-looking dudes.

19:28.117 --> 19:29.795
And what are they doing?

19:29.819 --> 19:31.129
I'm not sure.

19:31.153 --> 19:32.886
They definitely seem to know him.

19:34.457 --> 19:35.789
Okay, it's starting to get ugly.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.270
- They just grabbed him.
- Wait, what?

19:38.294 --> 19:39.972
Your client, or Magnum's client,

19:39.996 --> 19:41.540
whoever's client this guy is,
they just threw him

19:41.564 --> 19:42.908
in a van. What should I do?

19:42.932 --> 19:43.942
Follow them.

19:43.966 --> 19:45.344
Okay, don't make it obvious,

19:45.368 --> 19:47.112
just do not let them out of your sight.

19:47.136 --> 19:48.580
I got it.

20:21.933 --> 20:24.949
Those two guys dragged
your client inside there

20:24.974 --> 20:26.308
about ten minutes ago.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.953
No one's been in or out since.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.821
"L&D Hardware."

20:31.224 --> 20:33.770
Okay, looks like it's been
closed for a few months.

20:33.794 --> 20:35.939
Why don't you see if there's
an expired Yelp page on them?

20:35.963 --> 20:37.774
You think
now's the time to check out

20:37.798 --> 20:40.143
reviews of a joint
that went out of business?

20:40.167 --> 20:43.079
No, often times, people leave
photos with the reviews,

20:43.103 --> 20:45.448
so maybe get an idea
of the layout of the place.

20:45.472 --> 20:47.016
Oh, so we can scope it out from here.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.841
It looks like there are plenty of photos.

20:51.478 --> 20:53.111
Wait, go back to the last one.

20:55.082 --> 20:57.460
Behind that employee there's a back door.

20:57.484 --> 20:59.217
Can you zoom into the door lock?

21:01.355 --> 21:03.366
Simple pin and tumbler lock.
Even you can pick that.

21:03.390 --> 21:04.968
Whoa,
whoa. You don't think these guys

21:04.992 --> 21:06.358
will catch you sneaking in?

21:07.427 --> 21:09.405
You know,

21:09.429 --> 21:12.831
not if they're distracted
by a surly guy in a wheelchair.

21:25.612 --> 21:27.023
Uh...

21:27.047 --> 21:28.348
what's that for?

21:29.716 --> 21:31.361
You may be my partner,

21:31.385 --> 21:33.229
but you have a lot to learn
about being an investigator.

21:33.253 --> 21:34.397
I'm gonna use this...

21:34.421 --> 21:36.052
As a diversion, yes, I know.

21:36.076 --> 21:37.800
But then, what's Shammy doing?

21:37.824 --> 21:40.024
Okay, what I'm implementing
here is what's known

21:40.049 --> 21:42.510
in the business
as a "double bluff diversion."

21:42.510 --> 21:44.710
No one calls it that.
You just made that up.

22:03.431 --> 22:06.243
Hey. Sorry, man, the store's closed down.

22:06.267 --> 22:07.978
Oh, yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm looking to rent the space.

22:08.002 --> 22:10.081
For my business...
Hey, are you the owner?

22:10.105 --> 22:11.415
Things are a little busy right now.

22:11.439 --> 22:12.616
Why don't you come back later?

22:12.640 --> 22:14.552
Yeah, yeah, great. That would be great.

22:14.576 --> 22:15.986
When? Let me just check my schedule here.

22:16.010 --> 22:18.789
- I don't know, two weeks.
- Uh, no, two weeks doesn't work for me.

22:18.813 --> 22:20.646
Hey, can you tell me
the square footage on this?

22:43.138 --> 22:45.516
Yo! Where the hell's that coming from?

22:45.540 --> 22:47.273
Somewhere back there.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.558
It's here.

23:20.293 --> 23:22.401
Okay, so are you gonna
tell us what's going on?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.360
Who were those guys?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.404
It doesn't matter.

23:24.428 --> 23:26.473
Look, I know you hired us
for your divorce,

23:26.497 --> 23:27.974
but whatever you've gotten
yourself into, we can help.

23:27.998 --> 23:29.109
- No, you can't.
- How do you know?

23:29.133 --> 23:30.176
Because no one can.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.045
- Okay? The damage is done.
- Look,

23:32.069 --> 23:33.604
John, we've dealt with some
really difficult...

23:33.628 --> 23:35.272
Let it go! All right?

23:35.739 --> 23:37.717
I'm done talking about this.

23:37.741 --> 23:39.786
All right, we hear you.

23:39.810 --> 23:41.554
Look, I appreciate
what you did back there,

23:41.578 --> 23:43.047
but this is my problem.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.723
I'll deal with it.

23:53.090 --> 23:55.002
Noelani, hey, what do you got?

23:55.026 --> 23:56.003
Good news.

23:56.027 --> 23:57.604
Your John Doe is in the system.

23:57.628 --> 24:01.541
63-year-old Caucasian male
named Justin Madison.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.210
Oh, thank God.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.112
Um, you got any info on him?

24:05.136 --> 24:06.546
Does he have any relatives?

24:06.570 --> 24:09.049
Um, yes, a daughter named Suzy.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.284
The mystery woman.

24:11.308 --> 24:13.687
Hey, listen, do you mind if I notify her?

24:13.711 --> 24:16.890
You seem pretty invested
in this guy for not knowing him.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.292
Well, look, the guy died at La Mariana.

24:19.316 --> 24:20.527
I found him.

24:20.551 --> 24:23.118
I feel like I-I should be
the one to tell her.

24:24.555 --> 24:26.533
Well, it's not something
that I can approve,

24:26.557 --> 24:28.068
but I do have some pull.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.958
So you'll make it happen?

24:31.429 --> 24:33.040
I'll see what I can do.

24:33.064 --> 24:35.064
Thank you.

24:39.937 --> 24:43.150
Maxine was right to be
suspicious about John, but...

24:43.174 --> 24:45.952
I'm wondering if her hunch was off.

24:45.976 --> 24:48.620
So you are coming around to the
idea that maybe John wasn't cheating?

24:48.644 --> 24:50.757
Well,
Maxine detected elevated heart rates

24:50.781 --> 24:53.060
in John's fitness app
at odd hours of the night.

24:53.084 --> 24:55.929
But whatever he's got into
could actually account for that.

24:55.953 --> 24:57.786
Now we just got to find out what that is.

25:01.091 --> 25:02.436
What is it?

25:02.460 --> 25:04.571
Oh, nothing, I'm just...

25:04.595 --> 25:05.939
thinking about the Gilberts.

25:05.963 --> 25:08.975
Their issues aren't
infidelity or anything.

25:08.999 --> 25:11.411
It's a lack of communication and honesty.

25:11.435 --> 25:13.001
And those things should
be fixable, you know?

25:16.707 --> 25:17.684
Hey, Kumu.

25:17.708 --> 25:20.854
Hey, I pulled up
John and Maxine's finances

25:20.878 --> 25:23.256
to see if there's anything
suspicious like you asked.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.991
And other than John's secret credit card,

25:25.015 --> 25:26.927
- did you find anything?
- Oh, yeah.

25:26.951 --> 25:29.529
Looks like he drained their
retirement account with just

25:29.553 --> 25:31.631
a few withdrawals within the past month.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.333
Well, it's not a leap
to think this is somehow

25:33.357 --> 25:35.268
connected to whatever trouble John's in.

25:35.292 --> 25:37.137
Kumu, how did he take out the money?

25:37.161 --> 25:39.473
Was it online transactions
or physical withdraws?

25:39.497 --> 25:42.442
It was all online to two websites.

25:42.466 --> 25:43.866
I'll send you the document.

25:45.402 --> 25:46.947
Got it.

25:46.971 --> 25:48.949
OverlayOdds.com

25:48.973 --> 25:51.485
and TheCasinoCage.com.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.120
Yeah, they're gambling sites.

25:53.144 --> 25:55.188
He's been wagering away their savings.

25:55.212 --> 25:58.380
Guessing he owes a lot of money
to those guys who grabbed him.

26:07.282 --> 26:09.336
Hey.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.837
Interested in a piece?

26:10.861 --> 26:13.206
Oh, it's really great stuff, but...

26:13.230 --> 26:14.741
I'm the guy that called.

26:14.765 --> 26:16.576
Oh, Rick.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.178
Yeah, um...

26:18.202 --> 26:21.336
listen... I-I got some news.

26:22.263 --> 26:23.783
I-I just thought it'd be better

26:23.807 --> 26:25.051
if you hear it from me in person.

26:25.075 --> 26:26.586
What's this about?

26:26.843 --> 26:28.488
It's about your dad.

26:28.512 --> 26:30.023
Um...

26:30.047 --> 26:32.692
I'm so sorry to be the one
to tell you this, but...

26:32.716 --> 26:36.084
last night he had a heart attack
and he passed away.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.533
Thanks.

26:39.557 --> 26:40.889
That's it?

26:43.861 --> 26:45.906
Uh, well, I have the contact info

26:45.930 --> 26:47.407
where he's located if you want it...

26:47.431 --> 26:48.675
I'm good, thanks. I actually thought

26:48.699 --> 26:50.076
he may have been dead already.

26:50.831 --> 26:53.213
Look,
it's all good... I haven't spoken to him

26:53.237 --> 26:55.849
ever since he walked out
on me and my mom years ago.

26:56.206 --> 26:57.749
Oh.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.753
I'm so sorry.

26:59.777 --> 27:02.170
Don't be, trust me.
It was for the better.

27:02.780 --> 27:06.660
Uh, look, I should get going,
but thank you for coming out.

27:06.684 --> 27:08.417
Have a good day.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.901
What? If he wasn't having an affair,

27:14.925 --> 27:16.436
why was he sneaking out at night?

27:16.460 --> 27:17.804
He's gambling.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.028
I don't believe it.

27:21.298 --> 27:22.776
He promised he quit.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.079
Before John and I got serious,

27:26.103 --> 27:28.348
he admitted that he had
a gambling problem

27:28.372 --> 27:30.951
before we met, but he got help for it.

27:30.975 --> 27:33.453
Well, it appears like he slipped
back into his old habits.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.956
And now he's in over his head

27:35.980 --> 27:38.874
with some rather dangerous people.

27:44.855 --> 27:46.333
It's John.

27:46.357 --> 27:47.834
Hmm, answer it.

27:47.858 --> 27:49.269
John, uh...

27:49.293 --> 27:50.770
where are you?

27:50.794 --> 27:52.472
We need to talk. I can't.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.241
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

27:54.265 --> 27:56.243
I-I really screwed up.

27:56.267 --> 27:58.745
John, I know about the gambling.

27:58.769 --> 28:01.314
I'm sorry for hiding it...

28:01.338 --> 28:02.415
I was ashamed.

28:02.439 --> 28:03.883
I ruined everything, Max.

28:03.907 --> 28:04.918
You deserve better.

28:04.942 --> 28:06.675
But I'm gonna make it okay, I swear.

28:08.212 --> 28:09.556
Eh, what do you mean?

28:09.580 --> 28:10.857
Don't worry.

28:10.881 --> 28:13.593
All right? Just know
that I always loved you and...

28:13.617 --> 28:15.284
and this will all be over soon.

28:17.204 --> 28:19.599
John... sweetie, you're scaring me.

28:19.623 --> 28:21.023
What are you...

28:22.493 --> 28:23.970
Call him back.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.139
Unavailable.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.174
What did he mean
"this will all be over soon"?

28:28.198 --> 28:30.944
It sounds like he's about
to do something drastic.

28:30.968 --> 28:33.035
Which is why we need to find him fast.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.535
It's still going to voice mail.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.362
It's okay, I'm pinging John's cell phone.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.305
He turned it off.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.323
Yeah, it's okay.
She'll pinpoint the location.

28:46.108 --> 28:47.585
Okay, he's in Chinatown.

28:47.609 --> 28:49.253
3245 King Street

28:49.277 --> 28:51.187
at a place called the Songbird Lounge.

28:53.782 --> 28:55.426
It's owned by one

28:55.450 --> 28:57.120
- Ray Barnes.
- I know that name.

28:57.144 --> 28:59.805
Barnes is connected to,
well, you name it...

28:59.830 --> 29:02.909
narcotics, weapons trafficking
and underground casinos.

29:02.933 --> 29:04.477
Okay, Maxine, stay here.

29:04.501 --> 29:07.002
We're gonna head to
Chinatown and find John.

29:15.395 --> 29:17.223
You're still distracted, bro.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.025
How can you tell?

29:19.049 --> 29:22.695
'Cause you just topped off
my coffee with Coops on draft.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.270
What's on your mind, man?

29:31.019 --> 29:33.373
Aw, man, this, uh...

29:33.397 --> 29:35.308
this whole Suzy thing, you know,

29:35.332 --> 29:37.444
it's got me thinking about my own dad.

29:37.468 --> 29:40.046
You know, when he left us, I was so mad

29:40.070 --> 29:41.681
that I hardly ever talked to him again.

29:41.705 --> 29:43.872
I never got a chance to say goodbye.

29:45.279 --> 29:47.157
You know, when he, when he died...

29:48.328 --> 29:49.989
I just...

29:50.747 --> 29:52.959
I pretended like it didn't
bother me, you know?

29:52.983 --> 29:54.394
And that was a lie.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.963
You know, burying my feelings, all that,

29:56.987 --> 29:59.833
for so long, it just,
it just ate me up inside.

29:59.857 --> 30:01.022
You know, and-and I...

30:02.270 --> 30:05.505
Even though Suzy's dad died,

30:05.529 --> 30:07.507
and she didn't get
a chance to say goodbye,

30:07.531 --> 30:08.165
I, uh...

30:08.665 --> 30:11.466
I just want her to know
it's okay to grieve.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.622
You know, the one thing I don't get

30:14.646 --> 30:17.459
is her dad said he had
to get back to Suzy.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.428
But she said they hadn't
spoken in 15 years.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.452
Yeah, it is odd.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.191
What?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.998
Think I know what he meant.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.195
It's time.

30:54.219 --> 30:55.563
You switch the plates?

30:55.587 --> 30:56.731
Yeah.

30:56.755 --> 30:58.148
Let's go.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.783
Looks like John's going
with them willingly.

31:14.807 --> 31:16.050
I'm gonna follow him.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.019
Hey, lookie-loos.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.509
Inside.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.460
Lookie-loos?

31:25.484 --> 31:28.229
You know, that's-that's a term
that really fell out of use.

31:28.253 --> 31:29.397
I haven't heard that for a long time.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.065
You know what else is, uh...

31:31.089 --> 31:33.535
used to be pretty common
was "wisenheimer."

31:33.559 --> 31:35.492
Love that term...

32:04.456 --> 32:06.734
Little help, please!

32:08.427 --> 32:09.804
He's just one guy!

32:09.828 --> 32:11.928
He's a really big guy.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.416
What did you guys do with John?

32:21.440 --> 32:22.717
- Yeah.
- Where'd he go?

32:22.741 --> 32:24.185
Go to hell.

32:24.209 --> 32:26.654
Look, I'm only gonna ask you once...

32:30.983 --> 32:32.260
He wasn't gonna tell you anything

32:32.284 --> 32:34.095
and we're running out of time, come on.

32:34.476 --> 32:35.887
Where you going?

32:35.912 --> 32:37.330
The information we need
is in that office.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.656
He looked over there
when you asked him about John.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.774
Magnum?

33:02.948 --> 33:04.492
They were planning a heist.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.327
And the target
is the vault at the Honolulu

33:06.351 --> 33:07.595
Jewelry Company on Kohai.

33:07.619 --> 33:08.997
That's a potentially huge score.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.164
And risky one.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.000
They're gonna burn a lot
of time inside that vault

33:12.024 --> 33:14.102
- and not have a huge window to get away.
- Yeah, true.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.737
But if they have a
professional race car driver

33:15.761 --> 33:17.772
as their wheelman, it kind of
ups the odds, doesn't it?

33:17.796 --> 33:19.941
Ray Barnes must have leveraged
John's gambling debts

33:19.965 --> 33:21.342
and forced him to join the crew.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.678
John is a good guy who got
caught up in a bad situation.

33:23.702 --> 33:24.812
We can't let this happen.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.970
Right. We need to move. Now.

33:42.368 --> 33:45.176
Keep the engine running,
doors unlocked and the phone on.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.116
Go over the escape route
and keep your eyes peeled.

33:48.140 --> 33:50.493
You see any cops, you call.

33:50.517 --> 33:52.013
Yeah, I got it.

33:52.620 --> 33:53.930
Hey.

33:53.954 --> 33:55.432
I got it.

33:55.456 --> 33:57.216
You better.

34:10.004 --> 34:11.214
Gordon's sending units,

34:11.237 --> 34:12.382
but they're gonna
stay off the police bands.

34:12.406 --> 34:13.382
What's going on with John's phone?

34:13.407 --> 34:15.118
It's online, but he's not picking up.

34:15.141 --> 34:16.675
- Text him.
- Say what?

34:27.014 --> 34:29.014
_

34:31.926 --> 34:33.469
Hello?

34:33.494 --> 34:35.304
John! We know what's going on

34:35.329 --> 34:36.672
and where you are, and so do the cops.

34:36.697 --> 34:38.775
HPD will be there any minute.

34:38.799 --> 34:40.443
You need to leave now.

34:40.467 --> 34:42.978
If I leave, they will kill me.

34:43.003 --> 34:45.315
Well, if you stay, you'll get
caught, and you'll go to prison

34:45.339 --> 34:46.616
for a very long time.

34:46.639 --> 34:48.918
Well, that doesn't matter.
I got nothing left.

34:48.943 --> 34:51.610
Yes, you do, you have Maxine,
John; she still loves you.

34:56.617 --> 34:58.962
John, please.
We're running out of time.

35:00.120 --> 35:03.366
Don't move. Don't move.
Stay cool. Come on, man!

35:03.390 --> 35:06.169
Let's move. Hey! Hey!
What are you looking at?!

35:06.193 --> 35:07.637
Eyes on the floor!

35:07.661 --> 35:09.306
Let's go. Let's go!

35:09.330 --> 35:12.709
Come on. Move.

35:12.733 --> 35:15.000
Got it. Let's go.

35:16.370 --> 35:18.949
Keep your heads down. Keep 'em down!

35:18.973 --> 35:21.440
Where the hell is he?

35:26.981 --> 35:28.625
Drop your weapons. Hands in the air!

35:36.457 --> 35:38.190
Get on the
ground. Get on the ground.

35:56.443 --> 35:57.420
You all right?

35:57.444 --> 35:58.921
Yeah.

36:02.049 --> 36:03.860
Gordon, what happened?

36:06.587 --> 36:08.331
It's over.

36:08.355 --> 36:09.599
Okay. Thanks.

36:09.623 --> 36:11.868
Thank you. They got 'em.

36:11.892 --> 36:14.860
There's someone that wants
to talk to you.

36:17.998 --> 36:19.342
Max?

36:19.366 --> 36:21.700
Thank God you're okay.

36:24.405 --> 36:26.516
I'm so sorry. I don't...

36:26.540 --> 36:28.569
I don't even know where to begin.

36:28.593 --> 36:31.910
How about just
coming home first, huh? Just...

36:33.213 --> 36:34.746
Just come home.

36:36.717 --> 36:39.217
Yeah, okay.

36:51.131 --> 36:52.876
Okay, I'm here.

36:52.900 --> 36:55.678
- Wanna tell me why?
- Come with me.

36:55.702 --> 36:57.414
So, I couldn't figure out
why your dad said

36:57.438 --> 36:59.783
he had to get back to Suzy
after you two hadn't spoken

36:59.807 --> 37:01.418
in 15 years.

37:01.442 --> 37:03.319
Then I started putting
the pieces together.

37:03.343 --> 37:05.388
He was at a bar on the water.

37:05.412 --> 37:08.491
The only thing in his pocket
was a piece of paper.

37:08.515 --> 37:10.493
That piece of paper was a docking slip.

37:10.517 --> 37:11.528
What's your point?

37:11.552 --> 37:13.096
It means he was a man of the sea.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.098
No, I mean, what does this
have to do with me?

37:15.122 --> 37:19.736
Well, it turns out,
not only is Suzy your name,

37:19.760 --> 37:23.940
but it also happens to be
the name of a houseboat

37:23.964 --> 37:25.424
that your father lived on.

37:28.635 --> 37:32.816
Look, if this is his estate or something,

37:32.840 --> 37:35.470
I'm not interested in
inheriting an old boat.

37:35.494 --> 37:36.953
Fair enough.

37:36.977 --> 37:39.244
But maybe you should take
a look inside first.

37:44.518 --> 37:45.851
Come on.

37:58.932 --> 38:01.211
These are from when I was a kid.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.711
Before he left.

38:04.349 --> 38:06.171
There's more.

38:09.297 --> 38:10.629
Here. Watch your step.

38:16.383 --> 38:19.184
I noticed the similarities
to the ones at your art stand.

38:20.687 --> 38:22.999
Your dad was obviously a fan.

38:24.023 --> 38:26.335
I sell a lot of my work online.

38:26.360 --> 38:29.239
I had no idea he was
the buyer of these paintings.

38:29.571 --> 38:32.063
Well, wait until you see this.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.820
He must have
lived a pretty humble life

38:43.844 --> 38:46.055
to be able to afford all these.

38:55.022 --> 38:57.734
Selling these paintings got me
through a few rough patches.

38:57.758 --> 39:00.470
Well, it looks like
he wanted to support you

39:00.964 --> 39:02.632
from a distance.

39:03.313 --> 39:07.010
And, look, I'm not gonna pretend
like I know you guys' history,

39:07.034 --> 39:11.196
or say you should forgive him;
that's not my place.

39:12.614 --> 39:15.874
But it sure as hell looks
like he cared about you.

39:23.784 --> 39:25.762
We arrested
Ray Barnes as an accessory,

39:25.786 --> 39:27.730
but I'm gonna need to bring
John in for more questioning.

39:27.754 --> 39:29.098
Aw, come on.

39:29.122 --> 39:32.202
He and Maxine just decided
not to get a divorce.

39:32.226 --> 39:33.573
Can't you give him a minute?

39:33.597 --> 39:35.471
Plus, the guy didn't even break any laws.

39:35.495 --> 39:36.806
I'm not planning on
charging him with anything,

39:36.830 --> 39:38.374
but we still need his cooperation.

39:38.398 --> 39:39.642
Are you always this fun at weddings?

39:39.666 --> 39:40.810
This isn't a real wedding.

39:40.834 --> 39:42.312
You guys are lucky
I'm not reporting this.

39:42.336 --> 39:43.580
You're here as a guest.

39:43.604 --> 39:44.914
You're technically an accessory.

39:44.938 --> 39:47.472
She has a point.

39:53.363 --> 39:56.092
Please tell me those aren't for tears.

39:56.116 --> 39:58.928
You know this isn't
a real ceremony, right?

39:58.952 --> 40:01.564
Hey, a wedding is a wedding.

40:01.588 --> 40:02.899
You know how I get.

40:02.923 --> 40:04.500
Yeah, I do, actually.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.658
You sure you're cool with this?

40:08.426 --> 40:11.507
Look, if I was gonna lose a fake bride

40:11.531 --> 40:14.377
at a fake wedding to a fake
groom that wasn't me,

40:14.401 --> 40:16.334
I'm glad it's you, brother.

40:17.638 --> 40:19.638
My man.

40:20.807 --> 40:21.985
By the way, where is Higgins?

40:22.009 --> 40:23.886
We only got the kahu for an hour.

40:23.910 --> 40:25.088
I don't know.

40:25.112 --> 40:27.356
She said she would
be here 20 minutes ago.

40:41.561 --> 40:42.605
Fake nerves?

40:42.996 --> 40:44.674
Something like that.

40:44.698 --> 40:48.177
You know, for what it's worth,
you were right.

40:48.201 --> 40:51.155
We shouldn't mix marriage
with our partnership.

40:51.198 --> 40:55.718
And there is nobody more loyal
and trustworthy than TC.

40:55.742 --> 40:58.610
I think he's... he's perfect for this.

41:01.915 --> 41:03.648
What's wrong?

41:05.311 --> 41:07.778
I'm having second thoughts.

41:09.523 --> 41:12.535
Uh, you mean you want to go back
to marrying me?

41:12.559 --> 41:14.470
No.

41:14.494 --> 41:15.627
I...

41:17.597 --> 41:22.033
I just... don't want to marry anyone.

41:25.772 --> 41:27.984
But you do know that means

41:28.008 --> 41:30.353
you would have to go back to England.

41:30.377 --> 41:32.822
Look, all I know is that...

41:33.255 --> 41:35.591
I can't go through with this.

41:35.615 --> 41:38.594
I mean, if John and Maxine have
taught me anything, it's that...

41:38.618 --> 41:42.432
dishonesty and pretense
destroy relationships.

41:43.181 --> 41:45.868
This isn't about the sanctity
of marriage at all.

41:45.892 --> 41:49.828
It's... I don't want to live a lie.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.646
I can't argue that.

41:58.138 --> 42:01.551
Are you absolutely sure about this?

42:01.575 --> 42:02.659
Trust me.

42:03.702 --> 42:06.255
It's not a rash decision.

42:06.279 --> 42:09.192
Ever since you first mentioned...

42:09.216 --> 42:11.848
marriage as a solution to this problem,

42:11.872 --> 42:13.463
it hasn't sat well with me.

42:13.487 --> 42:16.788
I just didn't know
to what extent until right now.

42:18.158 --> 42:20.093
So I guess that means we're done?

42:21.962 --> 42:23.706
For now.

42:24.139 --> 42:26.409
For what could be a very long time.

42:26.433 --> 42:27.877
You said it yourself.

42:27.901 --> 42:30.546
Thomas, you managed to run a...

42:30.570 --> 42:33.426
a modest operation
perfectly well without me.

42:33.450 --> 42:35.306
You'll be just fine.

42:38.812 --> 42:40.690
Yeah.

42:40.714 --> 42:42.247
Just fine.

42:44.584 --> 42:46.651
I'm sorry, Thomas.

42:50.373 --> 42:51.875
I'll go tell the others.

42:52.939 --> 42:54.338
Yeah.
