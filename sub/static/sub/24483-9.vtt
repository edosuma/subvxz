WEBVTT

00:08.095 --> 00:09.627
His vessel should've pancaked with him,

00:09.662 --> 00:11.564
- but it's fully intact.
- We triggered something

00:11.599 --> 00:13.134
before we understood it.

00:13.135 --> 00:16.004
Maybe this structure isn't
an entrance, but an exit.

00:16.038 --> 00:18.673
I miss you. Your daughter misses you.

00:18.707 --> 00:20.842
- Come home soon.
- Why'd you have to look?

00:20.876 --> 00:22.277
What in God's name have you been doing?

00:24.146 --> 00:25.680
Guys, something's going on
with the "Roci."

00:25.714 --> 00:27.315
I got no control of the ship.

00:27.349 --> 00:29.445
I'm James Holden. I'm here to declare

00:29.479 --> 00:31.986
for the OPA that Belters are the only

00:32.021 --> 00:34.122
legitimate benefactors of the Ring.

00:34.156 --> 00:35.925
We've struck at the Inners' vessels...

00:37.506 --> 00:39.794
- And we will strike again.
- That's not me.

00:39.829 --> 00:41.220
Well, it's coming from inside our ship.

00:41.255 --> 00:43.331
Grab continuous singles
of everyone and make sure

00:43.365 --> 00:45.133
we have all six "Roci" angles
of that explosion,

00:45.167 --> 00:48.089
and Amos can you just
keep this corridor clear?

00:48.090 --> 00:49.958
We have to fire on the
"Rocinante" and we have to

00:49.992 --> 00:52.727
do it now, otherwise they will
kill this ship along with his.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.663
Someone is trying to
play you... don't fall into it!

00:55.698 --> 00:57.065
Remove her from the Command Deck.

00:57.099 --> 00:59.634
- Kom wit milowda.
- Drummer, listen to me!

00:59.668 --> 01:02.804
Christ, the "Behemoth's"
target-locked us.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.174
What are you doing?
You can't outrun a missile.

01:06.208 --> 01:08.076
Don't...

01:08.110 --> 01:09.577
Fire!

01:12.681 --> 01:14.349
Come on, Miller! Give me something!

01:14.383 --> 01:18.853
Go into a room too fast,
kid, the room eats you.

01:18.888 --> 01:21.189
Alex needs to slow the ship
down or we're all dead.

01:21.223 --> 01:25.193
You need to change course and
go inside the Ring right now.

01:25.227 --> 01:27.070
This is gonna be nasty.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.812 --> 01:48.779
Power grid still throwing faults.

01:48.814 --> 01:51.616
- We lost it again.
- Reset it.

01:51.650 --> 01:53.284
Yes, bossmang.

01:55.020 --> 01:58.122
What the falote are
you smiling at, Captain?

01:58.156 --> 02:00.958
First time we fire a weapon,
and this is what we get.

02:00.993 --> 02:03.294
Well, what we got is what we get.

02:03.328 --> 02:05.162
- Hmm.
- Run the back scatter

02:05.197 --> 02:07.378
through again...
if the torpedo detonated,

02:07.379 --> 02:08.846
we should have seen an explosion.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.881
Nagata? What are you doing?

02:14.386 --> 02:18.556
Chief Engineer Naomi Nagata,
what are you doing?

02:20.392 --> 02:23.961
Okay, I understand this is
a difficult moment for you,

02:23.996 --> 02:26.130
but we have power failures
throughout the ship.

02:26.164 --> 02:28.899
- And I want you to...
- I don't work for you,

02:28.934 --> 02:31.235
and I don't work for Anderson Dawes.

02:31.269 --> 02:33.704
I gave the order to fire.

02:37.743 --> 02:39.577
You know we had to do it.

02:39.611 --> 02:41.112
If we hadn't, the Inners would have...

02:41.146 --> 02:43.080
- If you've killed them...
- Hate me later,

02:43.115 --> 02:45.148
work now.

02:51.623 --> 02:53.290
I'm sorry.

02:53.325 --> 02:55.075
If I killed them, I'm...

02:55.761 --> 02:57.428
I'm sorry.

03:15.947 --> 03:18.449
That torpedo engine...
it's burning like crazy,

03:18.483 --> 03:21.152
but it's not gaining, but...

03:21.186 --> 03:23.788
that thing should've rammed
itself up our tailpipe by now.

03:23.822 --> 03:26.690
But apparently the rules
ain't the rules around here.

03:26.725 --> 03:30.027
Maybe the torpedo was going too fast.

03:30.062 --> 03:33.264
Miller kept saying we had to slow down.

03:33.298 --> 03:35.166
It's like that slingshot asshole.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.469
Hold on a second,
you're saying that if things go

03:38.503 --> 03:42.106
too fast around here, something
gets nervous and grabs them?

03:42.140 --> 03:43.941
That ain't natural.

03:43.975 --> 03:46.209
I don't see any stars.

03:47.412 --> 03:49.780
Are we in some kind of a gas cloud?

03:49.815 --> 03:51.816
It's like something's around us,

03:51.850 --> 03:54.318
it's like we're in some
kind of goddamn bubble.

03:54.352 --> 03:56.454
There's so much damn interference.

03:56.488 --> 03:58.522
This reminds me of Eros.

03:58.557 --> 04:01.224
That's a comforting thought.

04:07.833 --> 04:10.568
Correction, that...
that torpedo is moving.

04:10.602 --> 04:12.470
It's slow, but it's definitely moving.

04:12.504 --> 04:14.780
How long before it hits us?

04:16.774 --> 04:19.410
It's not even heading towards us anymore.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.917
It's heading here.

04:28.919 --> 04:30.721
I don't even know what the hell that is.

04:30.755 --> 04:32.556
Miller didn't mention it.

04:32.591 --> 04:34.132
Miller?

04:35.894 --> 04:38.062
I've been seeing him
since the Ring turned on.

04:38.096 --> 04:40.898
Joe Miller? The guy who died on Venus?

04:40.932 --> 04:43.934
- Maybe he isn't exactly dead.
- Maybe he isn't

04:43.969 --> 04:45.069
- exactly Miller.
- What is he...

04:45.103 --> 04:47.037
Okay, this is a great
conversation for us to have

04:47.072 --> 04:48.168
once we're out of here, all right?

04:48.202 --> 04:49.834
We're still locked out
of comms and weapons.

04:49.868 --> 04:52.109
I don't wanna get into
anyone's firing range

04:52.144 --> 04:54.612
until we can explain that
that message was fake.

04:54.646 --> 04:55.935
The message came from here.

04:55.969 --> 04:58.048
Okay, do we have any thoughts
on how that happened?

04:58.083 --> 05:00.518
Other than something
compromised our ship?

05:00.552 --> 05:03.454
- No, I got nothing.
- That is our first priority.

05:03.488 --> 05:04.855
We have to make sure...

05:06.424 --> 05:07.725
Hey! Hey!

05:07.759 --> 05:09.360
- What did you do?
- Amos?

05:09.394 --> 05:11.862
That fake message was
somebody trying to kill us.

05:11.897 --> 05:13.731
It wasn't me, it wasn't you,
and it wasn't Alex.

05:13.765 --> 05:15.432
It wasn't us. We would have died too.

05:15.467 --> 05:17.868
I saw you snooping around
the Machine Shop.

05:17.903 --> 05:19.703
- He didn't do anything.
- I'm sorry.

05:19.738 --> 05:22.239
I'm sorry, I didn't know...
it was just supposed to be

05:22.274 --> 05:24.542
a back door so we could
get nav and comm logs,

05:24.576 --> 05:26.477
background information,
stuff you might not tell us.

05:26.511 --> 05:28.946
You piece of shit! You could
have gotten us killed!

05:28.980 --> 05:30.881
I didn't know it was anything weird.

05:30.916 --> 05:33.784
Hey! Hey, we got something
coming through the Ring.

05:33.818 --> 05:35.920
It's small.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.791
Looks like a probe.

05:47.432 --> 05:49.124
It's backing out.

05:50.602 --> 05:51.902
That's it?

05:51.937 --> 05:54.405
How would I... hold on.

05:57.342 --> 06:00.411
Something else is coming through.

06:00.445 --> 06:02.413
Looks like the "Xuesen."

06:05.617 --> 06:07.084
They matched our course.

06:07.118 --> 06:09.186
- Are they hailing us?
- Comms are dead.

06:09.221 --> 06:11.922
There's no way to tell.

06:11.957 --> 06:14.258
They target-locked us.
That could just be their way

06:14.292 --> 06:17.928
- of saying stop.
- If we stop, they'll board us.

06:17.963 --> 06:19.330
Are you ready to give up this ship?

06:19.364 --> 06:22.299
No. We keep going.

06:22.334 --> 06:25.536
Their torpedoes won't work
any better than the last one.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.037
That's good.

06:27.706 --> 06:29.873
We need our comms online.

06:30.508 --> 06:32.576
We need to talk to that ship.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.948
You're gonna tell me

06:37.983 --> 06:41.046
everything I need to know
to unfuck this ship.

06:41.820 --> 06:45.322
I'm telling you, I don't know what I did.

06:47.158 --> 06:50.461
Let's see if I can
get some inside information.

07:01.573 --> 07:02.989
Miller?

07:05.010 --> 07:06.341
Talk to me.

07:11.329 --> 07:13.833
What do you want me to find?

07:29.267 --> 07:31.101
Miller!

07:32.502 --> 07:40.322
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:47.945 --> 07:51.814
And in light of the changed circumstances

07:51.849 --> 07:54.383
regarding the attack on the "Seung Un"

07:54.418 --> 07:58.054
and the unexpected activity
of the Ring artifact,

07:58.088 --> 08:02.325
I am immediately recalling
all civilian presence

08:02.359 --> 08:04.327
from the UN mission.

08:04.361 --> 08:06.362
The UNN "Countee Cullen"

08:06.396 --> 08:09.098
will take all non-military personnel

08:09.133 --> 08:12.602
to Corely Station on Titan
for debriefing.

08:12.636 --> 08:16.706
Return transport will
be coordinated from there.

08:16.740 --> 08:20.376
I would not take this step
if I were not certain

08:20.410 --> 08:23.379
it is the best way to ensure your safety.

08:23.413 --> 08:26.282
Thank you all for your service

08:26.316 --> 08:28.384
and your bravery.

08:28.418 --> 08:30.353
You see they offering triple hazard pay

08:30.387 --> 08:32.188
- for contractors that stay?
- Mm-hmm.

08:32.222 --> 08:34.690
Time and a half I'll do. Triple time?

08:34.725 --> 08:37.193
- Someone's gonna die.
- I see that too.

08:37.227 --> 08:39.729
I'm taking my ass to Titan. Where's Ren?

08:39.763 --> 08:42.765
Pretty sure he was on the "Seung Un."

08:42.799 --> 08:44.867
Shit, I didn't know that.

08:44.902 --> 08:47.403
Mm-hmm, probably sleeping one off.

08:47.437 --> 08:48.738
Died the way he lived.

08:48.772 --> 08:50.847
Show some respect.

08:52.676 --> 08:55.378
We should probably clean out
his locker before we go...

08:55.412 --> 08:56.612
for his family.

08:56.647 --> 08:59.382
Yeah, okay.

09:03.921 --> 09:06.722
I understand the evacuation, I do.

09:06.757 --> 09:08.991
It's just, it's so frustrating.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.928
- I wish we could stay on board.
- I feel the same.

09:11.962 --> 09:15.830
To come so close and be turned aside...

09:16.633 --> 09:18.333
if only there were a way.

09:18.869 --> 09:20.403
Miss Fagan.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.572
Have you come to share
in our disappointment?

09:22.606 --> 09:24.607
Me?

09:24.641 --> 09:26.007
Oh, no.

09:26.925 --> 09:28.477
Well, at least the company
will be good on Titan.

09:28.512 --> 09:31.514
I'm sure you'll have a lovely time.

09:31.548 --> 09:33.649
You don't plan to join us?

09:33.684 --> 09:35.585
That would be telling.

09:43.727 --> 09:45.928
I'm starting to wonder
if she's even here.

09:45.963 --> 09:48.264
It'd be just like her
to ditch her own party.

09:51.468 --> 09:53.469
We really should be getting underway.

09:53.503 --> 09:55.705
I know, I'll find them.

10:04.982 --> 10:06.482
Oh, so now you think you know me?

10:06.516 --> 10:09.118
Your actions speak for themselves.

10:09.152 --> 10:11.053
I'm not asking for your permission.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.022
You are not going to
humiliate this family.

10:13.056 --> 10:14.991
This family is not my problem!

10:15.025 --> 10:16.459
Will you both do this later, please?

10:16.493 --> 10:18.160
I am not going to allow
any daughter of mine

10:18.195 --> 10:19.962
- to go whoring around the Belt.
- Whoring?

10:19.997 --> 10:22.031
Is that what you think I am?

10:22.065 --> 10:23.532
- I don't know what you are.
- Please?

10:23.567 --> 10:24.967
You were going to
announce your retirement

10:25.002 --> 10:26.302
from the racing team, tonight,

10:26.336 --> 10:27.970
in front of everyone,
without telling me...

10:28.005 --> 10:29.538
Do you think I wouldn't
rather come to you?

10:29.573 --> 10:32.008
You think that I like having
a father who cares more

10:32.042 --> 10:34.310
about what everyone else
thinks than about me?

10:34.344 --> 10:37.246
Stop being ridiculous.
I always listen to you.

10:37.281 --> 10:39.649
- He does.
- You are so ungrateful.

10:39.683 --> 10:42.826
You're small-minded
and spoiled and stupid...

10:42.860 --> 10:44.353
Fuck you!

10:48.759 --> 10:50.633
Fuck you.

10:51.628 --> 10:53.996
Everything you do is corrupt,

10:54.031 --> 10:57.974
and I can't stand to be part of it.

10:59.436 --> 11:00.903
I gave you everything.

11:00.937 --> 11:02.520
I don't want it.

11:03.273 --> 11:05.207
I'm done.

11:08.712 --> 11:10.379
Julie.

11:13.083 --> 11:15.551
Party's over. Send them home.

11:15.992 --> 11:18.587
I'm pulling the racing team
for the rest of the season.

11:22.993 --> 11:24.226
We'll pick up next year

11:24.261 --> 11:26.696
once your sister comes to her senses.

11:26.730 --> 11:28.864
I could take over for her.

11:28.899 --> 11:30.548
Don't be absurd.

11:49.319 --> 11:51.387
I didn't know it would
do anything like this.

11:51.421 --> 11:53.711
- Who was your contact?
- I never met them.

11:53.745 --> 11:55.725
- Try again.
- I don't know.

11:55.759 --> 11:57.693
I swear.

11:58.862 --> 12:00.453
But will this help?

12:06.770 --> 12:09.438
Alex?

12:09.473 --> 12:10.539
Yeah?

12:11.575 --> 12:13.174
Will this help you fix the comms?

12:13.883 --> 12:15.978
I'll be damned if I know.
That's a Naomi thing.

12:16.012 --> 12:18.012
Yeah, I knew you were gonna say that.

12:19.049 --> 12:22.351
All right, I'll take it from here,

12:28.125 --> 12:29.592
You did this,

12:29.626 --> 12:31.527
so you're gonna have to answer for it.

12:31.561 --> 12:34.296
I'm gonna to ask you this once,
and then I'm gonna kill her.

12:34.331 --> 12:35.631
No.

12:35.665 --> 12:38.157
How do I fix my ship?

12:38.635 --> 12:39.864
We don't know...

12:39.899 --> 12:42.438
Shhh.

12:42.472 --> 12:44.140
Let him answer.

12:45.642 --> 12:47.109
Answer me!

12:56.753 --> 12:58.387
Alex, what now?

12:58.422 --> 13:00.805
The "Xuesen" just launched
a couple of probes.

13:03.226 --> 13:05.127
One's heading back to the Ring.

13:05.162 --> 13:07.496
They just ran that first probe
faster and faster

13:07.531 --> 13:10.199
until it got stopped by... whatever,

13:10.233 --> 13:12.368
and now... now it's being
dragged into the center

13:12.402 --> 13:13.836
like the "Behemoth" torpedo.

13:13.870 --> 13:16.739
How fast was it going
when it got stopped?

13:16.773 --> 13:19.408
Just over 18,000 KPH.

13:19.443 --> 13:21.310
Okay, so now we have a speed limit.

13:21.344 --> 13:25.347
Yep, and the "Xuesen"
is accelerating to match,

13:25.382 --> 13:27.249
which, incidentally,
is more than we're doing,

13:27.284 --> 13:28.584
so yeah, they're gonna catch us.

13:28.618 --> 13:30.886
I'm not interested in being caught.

13:30.921 --> 13:34.356
Match their course and speed.
Stay ahead of them.

13:34.391 --> 13:35.791
Done.

13:37.127 --> 13:38.494
That other probe...

13:38.528 --> 13:41.363
it's not going through the Ring.

13:41.398 --> 13:45.067
It's heading towards the bubble.

13:50.807 --> 13:54.176
Hoss, that second probe...

13:54.211 --> 13:56.011
it's gone.

13:56.046 --> 14:00.115
What do you mean it's gone?
It went back out of the Ring?

14:00.150 --> 14:03.285
No, no, that looks different.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.754
See, the probe maintained the speed limit

14:05.789 --> 14:07.723
and then touched the
other side of that bubble,

14:07.757 --> 14:10.833
and then something happened
to it, like, um,

14:11.895 --> 14:13.896
blinked out of existence.

14:13.930 --> 14:17.399
Well, we should probably
keep away from the edges then.

14:17.434 --> 14:20.202
Yeah, that's a good safety tip.

14:21.738 --> 14:26.075
So, we, um, we turn,
and the MCRN catches us.

14:26.109 --> 14:27.610
And we go straight,

14:27.644 --> 14:30.312
and we're gonna reach the
other side of that bubble.

14:30.347 --> 14:33.815
We have until then to
figure out another option.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.767
Martian skiff just come out of da Ring.

14:42.802 --> 14:45.337
Ah, good to know that's possible.

14:45.371 --> 14:47.839
They putting out broadcast.

14:47.873 --> 14:49.774
To me.

14:49.809 --> 14:52.077
- All ships in the vicinity,

14:52.111 --> 14:54.913
this is an MCRN priority alert.

14:54.947 --> 14:57.082
We have determined that
electromagnetic distortion

14:57.116 --> 15:00.318
through the Ring is too severe
for comms to penetrate.

15:00.353 --> 15:02.354
The MCRN "Xuesen" is on the other side

15:02.388 --> 15:05.430
in pursuit of the "Rocinante"
and will apprehend.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.360
We strongly advise against
anyone going through the Ring

15:08.394 --> 15:10.962
until we have fully
assessed the situation.

15:10.996 --> 15:12.764
MCRN out.

15:16.802 --> 15:20.236
Where is our Chief Engineer?

15:32.151 --> 15:33.958
Checking up on me?

15:34.553 --> 15:36.294
Yeah, that too, yeah.

15:38.557 --> 15:40.992
When will the grid be stabilized?

15:41.026 --> 15:43.128
I'll have it patched by end of shift,

15:43.162 --> 15:46.064
but the system's designed
as a Generation Ship,

15:46.098 --> 15:48.633
- not for battle.
- Ah, well,

15:48.667 --> 15:51.703
it's not the best tool for the job,

15:51.737 --> 15:54.312
but it's the tool we have.

15:55.007 --> 15:57.475
I have news.

15:57.510 --> 15:59.210
Your friends survived.

15:59.245 --> 16:00.645
What?

16:00.679 --> 16:02.747
Yeah, well, it seems they did, anyway.

16:02.782 --> 16:05.583
The MCRN poked their head
back out to tell us all

16:05.618 --> 16:07.419
that they get to arrest Holden,

16:07.453 --> 16:10.578
and that we should just sit
on our hands while they do it.

16:11.424 --> 16:13.158
Not the sort of thing they'd say

16:13.192 --> 16:15.026
if the "Rocinante" had been destroyed.

16:15.060 --> 16:17.562
- Is the ship damaged?
- I don't know.

16:17.596 --> 16:19.597
What about Holden's transmission?

16:19.632 --> 16:21.332
- And the "Seung Un"...
- I don't know about

16:21.367 --> 16:23.501
any of that, but we will soon.

16:23.536 --> 16:24.702
We're going through?

16:24.737 --> 16:26.171
We didn't come all the way out here

16:26.205 --> 16:28.606
to be told to stay in our place.

16:34.380 --> 16:38.883
I'm glad, you know,
that your old crew survived.

16:38.918 --> 16:41.352
I'm happy for you,
and I'm happy for them.

16:41.387 --> 16:43.688
I never wanted them dead.
You fired on them.

16:43.722 --> 16:45.989
Technically, the Captain did that,

16:46.492 --> 16:48.626
but I would have done the same.

16:48.661 --> 16:50.795
We needed to make a show
of it for the Inners

16:50.830 --> 16:53.031
so they wouldn't lump us in with Holden.

16:53.065 --> 16:54.866
If they'd blamed us for the "Seung Un"...

16:54.900 --> 16:56.968
We would have been in a real fight...

16:57.002 --> 16:59.704
Holden didn't do any of that.

16:59.738 --> 17:02.040
- He's being framed.
- I believe you.

17:02.074 --> 17:05.910
So, you're okay with
killing innocent people?

17:06.531 --> 17:07.979
That just makes it worse.

17:08.012 --> 17:10.430
Not if they protect mine.

17:10.983 --> 17:13.651
Now, I know what you're
feeling. Guilty, keyá?

17:13.685 --> 17:15.819
Because we put your old crew in danger.

17:15.855 --> 17:18.289
Well, guilt is like salt.

17:18.324 --> 17:21.125
You put a little on, and it
hides all the bitterness.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.294
I don't know what you're on about.

17:23.329 --> 17:25.762
I miss my old crew too.

17:25.798 --> 17:27.965
"Tynan" was a good ship, good people.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.575
Mosh gut pirata in the Belt.

17:31.470 --> 17:33.137
Why did you leave them?

17:33.172 --> 17:36.975
I outgrew, the way you
outgrew your old ship.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.411
But then something happens, doesn't it?

17:40.446 --> 17:42.981
Hm? Makes us forget.

17:43.015 --> 17:45.617
Remember only the good times,

17:45.651 --> 17:48.753
and we start thinking, oh,
maybe we can get them back,

17:48.787 --> 17:50.922
be who we used to be,

17:50.956 --> 17:53.358
or the prettied-up version we remember.

17:53.392 --> 17:55.360
It's not so wrong to try.

17:55.394 --> 17:58.296
Nah, it never works.

17:58.330 --> 18:00.098
You let nostalgia trick you,

18:00.132 --> 18:02.482
and you'll regret it badly.

18:03.636 --> 18:06.611
You left your old crew for a reason.

18:08.007 --> 18:11.309
I left the OPA
long before I left the "Roci."

18:11.343 --> 18:15.179
And now you're back here
with us and we need you here.

18:17.550 --> 18:19.249
I'll fix the ship.

18:21.153 --> 18:23.154
Fair enough.

18:48.380 --> 18:50.280
Hoss?

18:52.785 --> 18:55.186
Everything okay in there?

19:00.292 --> 19:01.332
Hey.

19:04.396 --> 19:06.030
I would've... I would've called down,

19:06.065 --> 19:07.532
I just didn't wanna interrupt,

19:07.566 --> 19:09.924
you know, just in case you were...

19:12.538 --> 19:15.506
Uh, so, um,

19:15.541 --> 19:18.376
there's no, uh, no Miller?

19:23.215 --> 19:24.515
Miller!

19:24.550 --> 19:26.190
Jeez.

19:32.224 --> 19:35.059
Get your hands off of me,
you son of a b...

19:35.094 --> 19:36.894
You can't do this to us!

19:36.929 --> 19:38.930
- Amos, stop! Stop!
- We didn't do anything bad.

19:38.964 --> 19:40.698
- You can't space them!
- Yes, I can.

19:40.733 --> 19:41.866
This ain't gonna help anything.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.368
Help us, he's crazy!

19:43.402 --> 19:45.269
You better button up.

19:45.304 --> 19:47.705
I thought you said they were
helping you fix the comms.

19:47.740 --> 19:48.940
They don't know how to fix it.

19:48.974 --> 19:50.763
- I checked.
- How's this gonna help?

19:50.798 --> 19:53.044
Well, I was thinking,
since the comms are down,

19:53.078 --> 19:55.380
the only way to communicate is in person.

19:55.414 --> 19:56.981
And Mars isn't looking to arrest them

19:57.016 --> 19:59.057
for stealing a ship, so...

19:59.752 --> 20:01.452
You too. Put your lid on.

20:02.087 --> 20:03.655
I was just gonna send the camera guy,

20:03.689 --> 20:08.393
but with the vac suit gloves
on, you know how when he...

20:08.427 --> 20:10.395
I mean, the man's blind.

20:10.429 --> 20:12.164
It's time to go.

20:14.299 --> 20:15.533
Hey, wait!

20:16.389 --> 20:19.103
Make sure you tell them we
didn't blow up the "Seung Un."

20:19.138 --> 20:21.572
Tell them what really happened, please.

20:44.739 --> 20:46.581
All non essential personnel

20:46.606 --> 20:49.014
are required to report
to a debarkation officer

20:49.039 --> 20:51.140
for assignment to an evac transport.

20:51.175 --> 20:53.925
Anyone who does not comply
with this directive

20:53.950 --> 20:56.351
will be forcibly removed and placed upon

20:56.385 --> 20:58.157
the first available ship.

21:01.845 --> 21:04.480
It's fascinating, isn't it?

21:04.514 --> 21:06.281
It certainly is.

21:06.316 --> 21:09.685
It's not going to be
the same seeing it from Titan.

21:09.719 --> 21:13.222
It'll be exactly the same.
A screen is a screen.

21:13.256 --> 21:16.158
Yes, that's true, it's just...

21:16.192 --> 21:18.694
I was just trying to make you feel good.

21:18.728 --> 21:21.330
It won't be the same at all...

21:21.364 --> 21:25.734
There is no substitute
for actually being here.

21:25.769 --> 21:27.436
When are you shipping out?

21:28.405 --> 21:30.973
- When am I shipping out?
- Mm-hmm.

21:31.565 --> 21:34.543
Really, Pastor? Aren't you married?

21:34.577 --> 21:36.812
Yes, I'm...

21:36.846 --> 21:38.680
married.

21:40.417 --> 21:42.368
You're not leaving, are you?

21:43.286 --> 21:46.255
No. I'm in for the whole ride.

21:46.747 --> 21:49.291
Huh. How did you manage that?

21:50.260 --> 21:53.929
Blackmail... well, technically extortion,

21:53.963 --> 21:56.382
but blackmail just sounds good.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.269
The executive officer is about to retire,

22:00.303 --> 22:02.538
and, well, he's applied for a job

22:02.572 --> 22:05.174
at one of my mother's companies.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.676
It's the way of the world.

22:09.546 --> 22:12.356
Do you think you can
pull strings for me too?

22:13.216 --> 22:15.184
Why would you want that?

22:15.218 --> 22:16.852
Why do you?

22:16.886 --> 22:20.055
Oh, I'm an aging debutante

22:20.090 --> 22:22.558
papering my emptiness and regrets

22:22.592 --> 22:24.451
with thrill-seeking.

22:25.728 --> 22:27.246
Your turn.

22:30.207 --> 22:32.835
It's the first miracle
that's happened in my lifetime.

22:33.836 --> 22:37.406
It's the only miracle
that's happened in my lifetime.

22:37.440 --> 22:41.410
And it's not a miracle-miracle,

22:41.444 --> 22:42.636
but...

22:43.680 --> 22:46.215
It changes everything, and to be so close

22:46.249 --> 22:49.218
and then just turn away? It seems wrong.

22:52.922 --> 22:54.389
If I said I felt called...

22:54.424 --> 22:56.391
- That would be pushing it.
- It would.

22:56.426 --> 22:57.484
Uh...

22:59.662 --> 23:02.931
If I said I really needed
to see what's out there?

23:02.966 --> 23:05.576
Closer.

23:06.769 --> 23:09.671
You want to indulge in a selfish desire

23:09.706 --> 23:12.583
to be a part of something amazing.

23:13.610 --> 23:15.777
Yeah.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.349
We've struck at the Inner's vessels...

23:20.383 --> 23:22.584
I knew there was
something off about this guy.

23:22.619 --> 23:26.755
Hero to the solar system my ass.

23:26.789 --> 23:28.590
Makes you wonder
what else he was lying about.

23:28.625 --> 23:31.593
Everything he said he did, probably.

23:31.628 --> 23:33.829
Well, when the Dusters catch him...

23:33.863 --> 23:36.031
We'll know for sure.

23:39.869 --> 23:42.304
I put in for full benefits
on the aborted run.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.839
Ah, you're never gonna get that.

23:43.873 --> 23:45.874
Can't hurt to try.

24:04.327 --> 24:06.628
He's not gonna need it

24:06.663 --> 24:08.697
I wanna see his admin files.

24:08.731 --> 24:10.140
Hey.

24:11.734 --> 24:13.468
Performance reviews.

24:13.503 --> 24:15.671
"Soledad has decent technical knowledge,

24:15.705 --> 24:17.472
but she keeps starting social drama"?

24:17.507 --> 24:19.875
- True.
- Asshole.

24:19.909 --> 24:21.643
What's he say about me?

24:21.678 --> 24:23.545
Stannislaw Kulp.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.981
Good mark for competence, somehow...

24:26.015 --> 24:27.749
Put you in for a promotion.

24:27.784 --> 24:30.686
Aw, Ren, you shouldn't have.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.853
Melba Koh.

24:31.888 --> 24:34.489
"Melba is new, and has some
gaps in her knowledge base..."

24:34.524 --> 24:36.725
- Yeah, that's also true.
- Put it back.

24:36.759 --> 24:38.327
No, there's some good.

24:38.361 --> 24:40.829
"She has some real potential.
With a little mentoring,

24:40.863 --> 24:42.864
"she could be an outstanding technician.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.000
Worth investing in."

24:48.871 --> 24:50.172
Not tonight.

24:50.206 --> 24:51.773
I arranged this party for you.

24:51.808 --> 24:54.376
Now everyone's gone, and
all they're gonna talk about

24:54.410 --> 24:56.178
is what a train wreck it was.

24:56.212 --> 24:57.771
Let them.

24:58.281 --> 24:59.773
Let them?

25:00.883 --> 25:03.277
They're not just gonna talk about you.

25:03.653 --> 25:05.887
It's gonna be about me and Father.

25:05.922 --> 25:08.323
You humiliated us.

25:13.896 --> 25:16.265
Father has moved
heaven and Earth for you.

25:16.299 --> 25:18.800
You treat him like less than shit.

25:18.835 --> 25:20.969
- I'm tired of it.
- You're tired of what?

25:21.004 --> 25:24.906
Tired of you and your
holier-than-thou crap.

25:27.810 --> 25:29.144
Where are you going?

25:29.803 --> 25:32.214
Slumming with your precious Belters?

25:32.248 --> 25:33.649
Saving humanity from itself?

25:33.683 --> 25:36.985
Do you even know how
condescending you are?

25:37.020 --> 25:38.754
You're such a narcissist.

25:42.358 --> 25:43.725
Do not walk away from me.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.328
Don't you dare turn your back on me.

25:46.362 --> 25:49.865
I am through being humiliated by you.

25:54.637 --> 25:57.122
Our father is a damaged man.

25:58.274 --> 26:00.435
You're never gonna
be good enough for him.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.614
How about now?

26:31.556 --> 26:33.124
No.

26:40.365 --> 26:41.932
Nothing.

26:41.967 --> 26:45.002
Couldn't shut Miller up before.
Now he's just gone.

26:45.036 --> 26:47.304
Maybe going through the Ring
broke him, I don't know.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.939
How about you guys?

26:48.974 --> 26:50.708
Weapons and comms are fucked.

26:50.742 --> 26:53.477
Whatever Cohen did to the
"Roci," it got in deep.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.112
It's gonna take a shipyard to fix her.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.847
All right.

26:56.882 --> 26:59.049
We can't turn or the Martians get us.

26:59.084 --> 27:01.185
We can't keep going or we hit the side

27:01.219 --> 27:02.853
of this bubble and die.

27:02.888 --> 27:06.790
We can't talk to anyone, and
we can't shoot our way out.

27:06.825 --> 27:09.193
Our only hope is that Monica and Cohen

27:09.227 --> 27:11.629
- put in a good word for us.
- Yeah, um,

27:11.663 --> 27:13.330
I wouldn't really count on that.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.160
Alex thinks I was too hard on them.

27:17.102 --> 27:18.669
I was being gentle.

27:18.703 --> 27:21.005
I mean, I kind of wish
you'd run it by me first.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.740
- Sorry, Cap.
- It's all right.

27:22.774 --> 27:26.253
Okay, so, so what're we gonna do?

27:28.113 --> 27:29.280
Surrender.

27:31.425 --> 27:34.185
We slow down, let them board us,

27:34.762 --> 27:38.189
they'll see we were sabotaged,
and it'll clear our names.

27:38.223 --> 27:40.157
Maybe for the... the terrorism thing,

27:40.192 --> 27:41.725
but they're gonna take the "Roci."

27:41.760 --> 27:44.396
Yeah, probably.

27:44.963 --> 27:47.598
It's either that or we die.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.700
I didn't think it'd end like this.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.327
Oye, Beltalowda.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.381
Listen up.

28:52.931 --> 28:55.833
This is your Captain,

28:55.867 --> 28:59.638
and this is your ship.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.851
This is your moment.

29:04.643 --> 29:07.611
You might think that you're scared,

29:07.646 --> 29:10.014
but you're not.

29:10.048 --> 29:12.483
That isn't fear.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.352
That's your sharpness.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.588
That's your power.

29:18.857 --> 29:21.091
We are Belters.

29:21.126 --> 29:22.826
Nothing in the void...

29:22.861 --> 29:25.362
Is foreign to us.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.698
The place we go...

29:27.732 --> 29:30.000
Is the place we belong.

29:30.035 --> 29:33.213
This is no different.

29:35.573 --> 29:39.443
No one has more right to this,

29:39.477 --> 29:41.872
none more prepared.

29:42.647 --> 29:44.848
Inyalowda go through the Ring,

29:44.883 --> 29:47.451
call it their own,

29:47.485 --> 29:50.821
but a Belter opened it.

29:50.855 --> 29:53.791
We are the Belt.

29:53.825 --> 29:56.293
We are strong,

29:56.328 --> 29:58.295
we are sharp,

29:58.330 --> 30:00.731
and we don't feel fear.

30:00.765 --> 30:03.867
This moment belong to us.

30:03.902 --> 30:06.637
For Beltalowda!

30:06.671 --> 30:08.238
Beltalowda!

30:09.674 --> 30:10.641
Beltalowda!

30:10.675 --> 30:12.409
Yeah!

30:12.444 --> 30:13.477
Beltalowda!

30:42.107 --> 30:44.575
Evac transport for Titan Corley Station

30:44.609 --> 30:46.043
is now boarding.

30:46.077 --> 30:48.045
Please leave all baggage...

30:48.079 --> 30:50.347
and be sure it is properly tagged.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.949
The UN cannot be responsible...

30:51.983 --> 30:53.517
Hector.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.586
Anna, are you on this skiff too?

30:55.620 --> 30:57.872
I'm not, and neither are you.

30:57.907 --> 31:00.724
- Wha... I'm gonna lose my place.
- Your place isn't there.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.126
I found a way for us to stay.

31:02.160 --> 31:05.396
Just don't ask too many
questions because it's...

31:05.430 --> 31:07.349
Excuse me, ma'am.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.067
That's him.

31:10.101 --> 31:12.569
Ensign, you're out of uniform.
Come with me, please.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.204
No, I can't.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.974
Come now, and it won't be desertion.

31:17.008 --> 31:19.143
I signed up to fight
Dusters and Skinnies,

31:19.177 --> 31:20.811
not whatever the hell that thing is.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.279
You're a Marine, for God's sake...

31:22.313 --> 31:24.214
You saw what happened to the "Arboghast."

31:24.249 --> 31:26.076
Do you feel safe?

31:27.619 --> 31:29.820
Lock me up on Titan... I'm not
going through that thing.

31:31.589 --> 31:33.056
Get him out of here.

31:33.091 --> 31:34.992
- Sorry for the disturbance.
- Hey.

31:35.026 --> 31:38.429
- Safe travels.
- What's wrong?

31:38.463 --> 31:41.237
No, no, no. I can't go through.

31:41.271 --> 31:42.933
I... there are rules. I can't...

31:42.967 --> 31:44.902
I thought you wanted
to see it for yourself.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.937
To come so close to be turned away...

31:46.971 --> 31:49.072
- I can't.
- You're frightened.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.241
Me too.

31:51.276 --> 31:53.844
But so frightened that
you're willing to pass up

31:53.878 --> 31:56.013
your chance to be part of this?

31:56.047 --> 31:59.783
It's first contact.
It's not going to happen twice.

31:59.818 --> 32:03.954
I would go if it were just me, I would.

32:03.988 --> 32:05.989
But I... I have a family.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.425
My son is 11.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.997
I can't risk him growing up
without a father.

32:13.582 --> 32:16.918
The only thing that
I see within that Ring

32:17.569 --> 32:21.505
is more darkness and blood

32:21.539 --> 32:24.134
at the foot of a false idol.

32:24.976 --> 32:27.095
I was wrong before.

32:27.545 --> 32:29.513
God is not with us out here.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.284
Closing doors.

32:51.823 --> 32:53.866
Hello, my love.

32:53.900 --> 32:55.726
I, uh,

32:56.114 --> 32:58.716
I don't know how to say this,

32:58.750 --> 33:00.337
but I'm...

33:01.086 --> 33:03.054
I'm going through the Ring.

33:03.088 --> 33:06.757
With the transmission delay,
you won't get this message

33:06.792 --> 33:09.293
until I've already done it,

33:09.328 --> 33:12.730
and I won't hear your voice,

33:12.764 --> 33:15.099
uh, until I'm back.

33:15.133 --> 33:16.895
And, uh...

33:17.503 --> 33:20.107
I will...

33:21.106 --> 33:24.809
I'll be back... hmm.

33:24.843 --> 33:26.310
Wow...

33:26.345 --> 33:30.281
Parallel frequency ships are go.

33:30.315 --> 33:31.916
Security protocols are engaged.

33:31.950 --> 33:34.819
We're still waiting on skiff departures.

33:34.853 --> 33:36.454
Hi.

33:36.488 --> 33:39.123
I've seen you around the ship,
but we haven't actually met.

33:39.157 --> 33:40.525
I'm Anna.

33:40.961 --> 33:42.927
- My name is Melba.
- Hi.

33:42.961 --> 33:45.696
Are... are you staying
aboard for the transit?

33:45.731 --> 33:47.431
- Yes.
- Yeah.

33:47.466 --> 33:51.135
Me too, but now that
I've committed, I'm...

33:51.169 --> 33:52.870
I'm kinda feeling overwhelmed...

33:54.172 --> 33:55.642
I know what that's like.

33:56.308 --> 33:58.209
Am I bothering you?

33:58.243 --> 34:00.811
No, I'm just...

34:00.846 --> 34:02.446
no, it's fine.

34:02.858 --> 34:04.448
What made you decide to stay?

34:14.659 --> 34:16.159
Where's Julie?

34:17.996 --> 34:19.630
Bitch finally left.

34:19.665 --> 34:22.466
Don't talk about your sister that way.

34:23.253 --> 34:24.835
You called her worse tonight.

34:28.507 --> 34:31.969
She knows how to make me
angry, that's true.

34:33.445 --> 34:36.058
She reminds me what it
was like to be young.

34:36.748 --> 34:38.049
She has passion.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.562
She spat in your face.

34:41.453 --> 34:43.020
You admire her for it?

34:43.054 --> 34:46.223
She has the will to take
our name into the future.

34:46.257 --> 34:50.061
She refuses to be stopped, even by me.

34:50.094 --> 34:51.614
What do you do?

34:52.230 --> 34:54.297
Plan parties.

34:58.236 --> 34:59.837
Melba?

34:59.871 --> 35:01.706
Are you all right?

35:01.740 --> 35:03.040
The hazard pay.

35:03.075 --> 35:05.443
I stayed for the hazard pay.

35:05.477 --> 35:06.944
If you'll excuse me.

35:34.940 --> 35:37.975
You don't know me,
but I worked with your father.

35:38.010 --> 35:41.373
Ren was a friend to me,
and I'm sorry he's gone.

35:41.947 --> 35:44.148
I need to get a message to my father.

35:44.182 --> 35:46.250
His name is Jules-Pierre Mao.

35:46.284 --> 35:48.380
Yeah, that one.

35:49.121 --> 35:50.921
Daddy,

35:50.956 --> 35:54.659
everything you feared about the
protomolecule has come to pass.

35:54.693 --> 35:56.594
And instead of being
hailed as a visionary,

35:56.628 --> 35:59.296
you're rotting away in jail.

35:59.331 --> 36:01.434
I can't fix that.

36:02.868 --> 36:06.064
But I can destroy the man
who brought you low.

36:07.339 --> 36:11.275
And that's something Julie never could,

36:11.309 --> 36:13.572
and never would do for you.

36:14.646 --> 36:16.992
I just wanted you to know that.

36:58.924 --> 37:02.626
I thought Ashford was being paranoid.

37:02.661 --> 37:05.296
"Lock down the skiff," he say.

37:05.330 --> 37:06.731
I say, "Why?"

37:06.765 --> 37:09.300
He say, "To keep anyone from deserting."

37:09.794 --> 37:13.173
I say, "Why would anyone desert now?"

37:13.839 --> 37:15.342
So?

37:17.042 --> 37:18.676
Why?

37:18.710 --> 37:21.178
I came back for the wrong reasons.

37:21.213 --> 37:23.808
I'm a wrong reason now?

37:25.550 --> 37:29.820
The Belt is in your blood.
We are your people.

37:29.855 --> 37:31.816
And I love you.

37:33.391 --> 37:35.526
I always will.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.895
But you're going back to them...

37:37.929 --> 37:39.128
your Inners.

37:39.162 --> 37:42.244
I didn't understand what I was leaving.

37:44.302 --> 37:46.337
I was being...

37:46.371 --> 37:48.291
nostalgic.

37:50.041 --> 37:52.843
And without even a word to me?

37:52.878 --> 37:55.780
I was afraid you wouldn't let me go.

38:12.764 --> 38:15.466
You underestimate me.

38:24.776 --> 38:27.111
Don't go too fast out there.

38:53.973 --> 38:56.175
What are you slowing down
for? You were doing fine.

38:56.777 --> 38:58.377
Where the hell have you been!

38:58.411 --> 39:00.279
Come on, we gotta get to the crime scene.

39:00.313 --> 39:03.015
- We gotta check out the clues.
- No, no more crime stories.

39:03.049 --> 39:06.451
I wanna know exactly what you know.

39:06.486 --> 39:11.023
Oh, so you wanna talk about
the non-local quantum hologram,

39:11.057 --> 39:12.891
the phase-conjugate adaptive waves

39:12.926 --> 39:15.194
resonating in micro-tubules in the brain,

39:15.228 --> 39:18.063
which of course requires
some closed-timeline curves

39:18.097 --> 39:20.732
and Lorentzian manifold, and...

39:20.767 --> 39:22.719
you catch up, I'll wait.

39:24.938 --> 39:27.539
- So, a crime scene?
- Crime scene.

39:27.574 --> 39:31.043
We gotta go, come on,
to the station, to the nucleus.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.811
That... that thing in
the middle of the place

39:32.846 --> 39:34.546
that grabbed the ship and the torpedoes?

39:36.249 --> 39:39.051
I got a case to solve
and you want the truth.

39:43.523 --> 39:45.224
You seem different.

39:45.951 --> 39:48.961
Oh, the signal's
pretty good inside the Ring.

39:48.995 --> 39:52.464
It's, uh, it's really good.

39:52.498 --> 39:54.209
So you coming or not?

39:56.502 --> 39:58.303
Hmm?

40:08.548 --> 40:10.142
"Rocinante,"

40:10.984 --> 40:12.769
it's Naomi.

40:13.853 --> 40:15.988
I'm coming home.

40:25.531 --> 40:27.576
"Roci," do you copy?

40:28.735 --> 40:30.287
Guys?

40:31.337 --> 40:33.165
It's me.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.671
Hang in there.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.281
I'm coming.
