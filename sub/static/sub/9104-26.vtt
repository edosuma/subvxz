00:04.800 --> 00:07.040
<i>&lrm;just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:07.680 --> 00:10.840
<i>&lrm;But there's something about me</i>

00:11.200 --> 00:12.960

00:37.920 --> 00:39.760
<i>&lrm;What do you want?</i>

00:39.880 --> 00:42.120
&lrm;What? This is unacceptable!

00:42.280 --> 00:44.360
&lrm;The sample garment doesn't match.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.960
&lrm;All you had to do
&lrm;was follow a pattern, imbeciles.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.200
&lrm;What am I supposed to do?
&lrm;The show is in 3 days.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.440
&lrm;No, he's completely useless.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.520
&lrm;Call my assistant, Nathalie.
&lrm;She'll give you some other names.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.400
&lrm;He hides stuff
&lrm;behind the painting of mom?

01:01.560 --> 01:03.120
&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;I love dirty secrets.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.160
&lrm;[Plagg excitedly]
&lrm;Yes, go, go on.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.480
&lrm;I can't.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.200
&lrm;My dad will be angry.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.240
&lrm;I don't know the code,
&lrm;and I have fencing class.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.840
&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;You party-pooper.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.200
&lrm;Plagg, no!

01:21.800 --> 01:24.000
&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;My my, what have we got here?

01:24.160 --> 01:27.080
&lrm;A book on Tibet, a hotel flyer,
&lrm;a load of old junk.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.160
&lrm;Come on! Where's the good stuff?

01:29.440 --> 01:32.160
&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;I've seen this book before.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.040
&lrm;But who cares? I'm famished.
&lrm;I need camembert!

01:35.200 --> 01:37.360
&lrm;Why does my dad keep
&lrm;this in a safe?

01:37.520 --> 01:38.960
&lrm;[gasping] Hawk Moth?

01:39.120 --> 01:41.560
&lrm;Why is a monster
&lrm;in a book of superheroes?

01:41.720 --> 01:43.440
&lrm;[Plagg] Cheese! Didn't you hear me?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.880
&lrm;[footsteps]
&lrm;[gasping]

01:46.040 --> 01:49.800
&lrm;[approaching footsteps]

01:50.840 --> 01:52.960
&lrm;Adrien, you're going to be late.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.280
&lrm;I was looking for my homework.
&lrm;Silly me.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.680
&lrm;[Rose] Can you believe it?

02:01.840 --> 02:03.320
&lrm;Lila knows Prince Ali?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.400
&lrm;She even flew in his private jet.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.360
&lrm;Why did Jagged Stone write a song
&lrm;about Lila and not me?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.600
&lrm;Lila knows all
&lrm;the Hollywood directors.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.120
&lrm;She said she'd mention me
&lrm;to Mr Besielberg.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.400
&lrm;-Lila?
&lrm;-Yeah,

02:15.560 --> 02:16.880
&lrm;she just started here.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.480
&lrm;She gave me an interview.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.920
&lrm;Ladybug saved her life once.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.000
&lrm;Who is this girl?

02:24.160 --> 02:26.040
&lrm;What's she doing next to my love?

02:26.200 --> 02:28.280
&lrm;Lila's got the most incredible life.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.280
&lrm;And now she's going here.
&lrm;She's totally awesome.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.800
&lrm;What? Don't say that.
&lrm;This is super-bad.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.680
&lrm;What if he falls for her?

02:35.840 --> 02:37.560
&lrm;I've never flown in a jet.

02:37.720 --> 02:41.160
&lrm;Nobody's written a song about me
&lrm;and I don't know anyone in Hollywood.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.680
&lrm;He'll forget I exist!

02:45.040 --> 02:46.400
&lrm;Where are they going?

02:46.560 --> 02:48.240
&lrm;Alya, we've gotta stop them.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.760
&lrm;You need to chill out.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.160
&lrm;My Ladyblog had the most hits ever
&lrm;after that interview.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.400
&lrm;What's going on?

02:54.560 --> 02:56.840
&lrm;Has this girl hypnotized everyone?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.480
&lrm;Are you jealous, Marinette?

02:59.920 --> 03:01.400
&lrm;Me? Jealous?

03:01.560 --> 03:02.800
&lrm;No way.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.200
&lrm;Where is she?

03:21.080 --> 03:24.240
&lrm;Marinette, Adrien's book!
&lrm;I need a closer look.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.120
&lrm;Why are you
&lrm;so concerned about his book? Hide!

03:28.000 --> 03:29.880
&lrm;Now we can do our homework.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.960
&lrm;It's more fun doing it together.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.600
&lrm;[gasping] What's that?

03:35.760 --> 03:38.360
&lrm;Nothing, just stories about...
&lrm;superheroes.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.800
&lrm;[seductively] I love superheroes.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.760
&lrm;No, it's already too late!

03:47.600 --> 03:49.400
&lrm;[questioning sighs]

03:50.880 --> 03:51.760
&lrm;Ladybug?

03:52.160 --> 03:53.240
&lrm;[Adrien sighs]

03:54.280 --> 03:55.320
&lrm;She's amazing.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.400
&lrm;A girl doesn't need to wear
&lrm;a costume to be amazing, you know?

04:00.560 --> 04:01.800
&lrm;I don't know...

04:01.960 --> 04:04.520
&lrm;So, you've got
&lrm;a soft spot for the bug?

04:04.680 --> 04:05.640
&lrm;Me?

04:05.800 --> 04:07.560
&lrm;No, not at all.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.720
&lrm;You know,
&lrm;I happen to be friends with Ladybug.

04:10.880 --> 04:11.800
&lrm;Really?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.920
&lrm;We can chat about it but not here.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.600
&lrm;Let's meet in the park after school.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.839
&lrm;[growling]

04:19.000 --> 04:20.160
&lrm;[she yelps]

04:20.680 --> 04:21.839
&lrm;[gasping]

04:22.000 --> 04:23.240
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

04:23.400 --> 04:24.880
&lrm;[phone vibrates]

04:26.160 --> 04:29.080
&lrm;I gotta go.
&lrm;I've got a lesson in 58 seconds.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.760
&lrm;So... the park?

04:37.560 --> 04:38.880
&lrm;Sure.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.360
&lrm;A vixen superheroin...?

04:44.520 --> 04:46.040
&lrm;Interesting.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.760
&lrm;[Tikki gasps] Marinette.

04:48.920 --> 04:52.200
&lrm;I know. I've gotta talk to Adrien
&lrm;before he meets Lila.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.120
&lrm;He has to know she's a thief.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.520
&lrm;No. You can't say anything.
&lrm;I need to check out the book first.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.960
&lrm;If it's what I think, we have to get it.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.440
&lrm;I don't get it.
&lrm;Why do we need it?

05:03.560 --> 05:05.480
&lrm;I'll explain when I'm sure.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.000
&lrm;We mustn't let Lila out of our sight.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.080
<i>&lrm;Ladybug and me? We're like this.</i>

05:11.240 --> 05:12.680
&lrm;Liar.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.000
&lrm;[Tikki] There. She's coming out.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.160
&lrm;[Tikki sighs] We're too far away.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.880
&lrm;[bleeping]

05:29.520 --> 05:31.120
&lrm;Hi.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.280
&lrm;Oh no! He's already here.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.160
&lrm;She dumped the book in the bin.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.440
&lrm;What a brat.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.080
&lrm;-I'll get it.
&lrm;-No.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.200
&lrm;I have to get it.
&lrm;You take care of Adrien.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.240
&lrm;Tikki...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.560
&lrm;[Adrien]
&lrm;So you do know Ladybug, for real?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.480
&lrm;This is the book, Marinette.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.680
&lrm;Not only did Ladybug save my life,
&lrm;we've become close friends.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.840
&lrm;We've something special in common.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.480
&lrm;It's what I wanted to tell you about.

06:00.640 --> 06:01.840
&lrm;I'm the descendant

06:02.000 --> 06:04.320
&lrm;of a vixen superheroine, Volpina.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.600
&lrm;Volpina?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.440
&lrm;Volpina?

06:07.920 --> 06:09.400
&lrm;I read about her in my book.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.440
&lrm;Of course she's in it.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.280
&lrm;She's one
&lrm;of the most important superheroes,

06:14.440 --> 06:16.840
&lrm;and more powerful than Ladybug.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.920
&lrm;Ladybug doesn't even make the top 10.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.480
&lrm;My grandma gave me this necklace.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.120
&lrm;[Tikki] She's good, really good.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.920
&lrm;You've got your book.
&lrm;I can't lose Adrien.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.200
&lrm;Time to transform!

06:33.720 --> 06:35.640
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

06:50.360 --> 06:51.680
&lrm;Are you telling me

06:51.840 --> 06:53.400
&lrm;this is a... Miraculous?

06:54.600 --> 06:57.160
&lrm;Hey, Lila. How's it going?
&lrm;Long time no see.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.040
&lrm;I saw your interview.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.400
&lrm;Awesome job.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.120
&lrm;Sure, I remember when I saved your life

07:03.280 --> 07:06.400
&lrm;We've been good friends
&lrm;ever since, practically BFFs.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.760
&lrm;Actually, when did I save your life?
&lrm;I don't recall.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.840
&lrm;Yes, of course, now I remember...
&lrm;Never!

07:14.000 --> 07:16.040
&lrm;And we're not friends either.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.400
&lrm;Miss Show-off was trying
&lrm;to impress you and everyone else.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.640
&lrm;[sobbing]

07:20.800 --> 07:23.000
&lrm;So you're not a descendant
&lrm;of a superhero?

07:23.160 --> 07:24.760
&lrm;More like a super-liar.

07:25.560 --> 07:26.880
&lrm;How dare you!

07:27.040 --> 07:29.120
&lrm;Wait... Lila...

07:29.280 --> 07:31.080
&lrm;What was that all about?

07:31.240 --> 07:33.320
&lrm;I mean... weren't you a bit harsh?

07:33.480 --> 07:37.000
&lrm;I don't put up with lies
&lrm;especially when they're about me.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.920
&lrm;What is with you, Ladybug?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.600
&lrm;I may have gone overboard,

07:44.760 --> 07:47.320
&lrm;but at least I'm not dealing
&lrm;with her anymore.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.760
&lrm;My chances with Adrien... Gone!

07:50.920 --> 07:52.600
&lrm;I hate you, Ladybug.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
&lrm;[she growls]

07:57.880 --> 08:02.440
&lrm;Jealousy, deceit,
&lrm;and the desire to be a superhero.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.880
&lrm;This young lady is my perfect prey.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.040
&lrm;[whooshing]

08:11.600 --> 08:15.600
&lrm;Fly, my evil little one,
&lrm;and akumatise her!

08:24.720 --> 08:26.200
&lrm;[whooshing]

08:26.360 --> 08:28.520
&lrm;Volpina... I am Hawk Moth!

08:28.680 --> 08:30.960
&lrm;I'm giving you the power of illusion.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.400
&lrm;From now on your lies will come to life.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.640
&lrm;Gain Ladybug and Cat Noir's trust

08:35.799 --> 08:37.880
&lrm;and convince them you're a superhero.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.760
&lrm;Then, betray them
&lrm;and bring me their Miraculous!

08:41.159 --> 08:43.960
&lrm;It would be my pleasure, Hawk Moth.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.000
&lrm;[bubbling]

08:57.560 --> 08:59.880
&lrm;[gasping]

09:03.120 --> 09:04.160
&lrm;[gasping]

09:08.040 --> 09:10.120
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

09:27.960 --> 09:28.760
&lrm;Code red!

09:35.360 --> 09:36.840
&lrm;[Ladybug gasps]

09:40.640 --> 09:41.880
&lrm;[struggling]

09:46.840 --> 09:48.720
&lrm;[she yells]

09:52.480 --> 09:54.160
&lrm;[squawking]

09:54.680 --> 09:55.800
&lrm;[cooing]

10:02.240 --> 10:05.480
&lrm;I am Volpina,
&lrm;the only superhero Paris needs.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.440
&lrm;[cheering] Volpina, Volpina!

10:07.600 --> 10:09.400
&lrm;[chanting] Volpina, Volpina!

10:09.560 --> 10:10.560
&lrm;Volpina?

10:10.720 --> 10:13.280
&lrm;-We've got a new partner.
&lrm;-Isn't it weird?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.360
&lrm;A superhero appearing out of nowhere?

10:15.520 --> 10:17.280
&lrm;[Cat Noir] At least she got the job done.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.320
&lrm;I could have stopped the meteorite.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.840
&lrm;Hey, relax.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.320
&lrm;I'm just saying she seems awesome.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.760
&lrm;Hey, glad you dropped in.
&lrm;I need a hand. Come on.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.000
&lrm;[gasping]

10:32.400 --> 10:34.080
&lrm;[Cat Noir] I can't believe it,

10:34.240 --> 10:36.080
&lrm;it's Hawk Moth, in the flesh.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.240
&lrm;He never shows up.
&lrm;Something big is going on.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.960
&lrm;We can take him down
&lrm;but it'll take all of us.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.240
&lrm;We better make the most of our talents.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.480
&lrm;Count on us.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.880
&lrm;Very nice to meet you, Cat Noir.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.160
&lrm;Cool outfit.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.800
&lrm;Why thanks. You too.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.360
&lrm;[gagging]

10:52.840 --> 10:54.920
&lrm;First the meteorite,
&lrm;now Hawk Moth appearing,

10:55.080 --> 10:57.440
&lrm;on the same day?
&lrm;Isn't that unusual?

10:57.600 --> 10:59.360
&lrm;Why would you say that?

10:59.520 --> 11:01.040
&lrm;I was asking Cat Noir.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.040
&lrm;I'm finding you unusual today,
&lrm;everything OK?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.560
&lrm;I'm fine, just fine.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.760
&lrm;Volpina, what's your Miraculous?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.240
&lrm;My necklace.

11:09.400 --> 11:13.120
&lrm;-What power does it give you?
&lrm;-Flight and super-strength.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.280
&lrm;[whooshing]

11:16.280 --> 11:17.720
&lrm;He's getting away!

11:24.200 --> 11:26.480
&lrm;Ladybug, go left. Cat Noir, go right.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.360
&lrm;I'll come from... behind.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.920
&lrm;No! I'll go right,
&lrm;Cat Noir from behind,

11:31.080 --> 11:32.600
&lrm;and you... go left.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.960
&lrm;Fine.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.640
&lrm;-No difference to me.
&lrm;-Good.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
&lrm;[Volpina roars]

11:36.960 --> 11:39.280
&lrm;Can you chill out?
&lrm;She's one of us.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.360
&lrm;[she sighs]

11:55.360 --> 11:57.360
&lrm;He's running right into my trap.

12:01.960 --> 12:02.640
&lrm;Where did he go?

12:05.560 --> 12:06.640
&lrm;I'll take him.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.120
&lrm;Good, now that other one.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.000
&lrm;Where did he go?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.400
&lrm;[bleeping]

12:32.800 --> 12:34.040
&lrm;[she gasps]

12:34.200 --> 12:37.080
&lrm;I wouldn't move an inch if I were you.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.160
&lrm;Don't worry,
&lrm;I don't want to be your friend.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.240
&lrm;But now we won't be able to say
&lrm;you don't know me.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.400
&lrm;Lila?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.520
&lrm;You'll call me Volpina!

12:48.680 --> 12:52.440
&lrm;You're not a superhero.
&lrm;You're one of Hawk Moth's victims.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.560
&lrm;Everyone thinks I'm a superhero,
&lrm;including Cat Noir.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.400
&lrm;So you won't be able
&lrm;to call me a liar anymore,

12:59.560 --> 13:01.920
&lrm;because everyone will think
&lrm;you're the liar.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.600
&lrm;Volpina, take Ladybug's Miraculous,
&lrm;her earring. Now!

13:06.200 --> 13:08.000
&lrm;Before I get rid of you,

13:08.160 --> 13:10.840
&lrm;you're going to give me
&lrm;your Miraculous.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
&lrm;Never!

13:12.160 --> 13:15.360
&lrm;Do you really think
&lrm;you've got a choice, Ladybug?

13:15.520 --> 13:19.400
&lrm;Either you give me the Miraculous
&lrm;or the building goes down!

13:21.400 --> 13:22.360
&lrm;You wouldn't.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.760
&lrm;[screaming]

13:29.080 --> 13:31.240
&lrm;[screaming]

13:32.520 --> 13:33.520
&lrm;Stop!

13:37.680 --> 13:40.440
&lrm;[rumbling]

13:44.000 --> 13:47.680
&lrm;It's an illusion,
&lrm;like the meteorite, like Hawk Moth.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.600
&lrm;That's your power, isn't it?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.680
&lrm;[Ladybug] Illusion, lies,

13:51.840 --> 13:53.040
&lrm;Of course.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.640
&lrm;[popping]

13:55.800 --> 13:56.880
&lrm;[she roars]

13:57.040 --> 13:58.160
&lrm;[whizzing]

13:58.320 --> 13:59.600
&lrm;Of course.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.440
&lrm;Is Volpina with you?

14:01.600 --> 14:03.600
<i>&lrm;No, I can't find Hawk Moth either.</i>

14:03.760 --> 14:05.560
&lrm;He was never there.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.320
<i>&lrm;What? But we saw him?</i>

14:07.640 --> 14:09.040
<i>&lrm;That's Volpina's power.</i>

14:09.200 --> 14:11.760
<i>&lrm;She creates illusions.</i>
<i>&lrm;Hawk Moth wasn't real.</i>

14:11.920 --> 14:13.520
&lrm;What are you saying?

14:13.680 --> 14:17.120
<i>&lrm;She's not a superhero.</i>
<i>&lrm;She was akumatised by Hawk Moth.</i>

14:17.440 --> 14:20.480
&lrm;-I don't get it. Why?
&lrm;-<i>&lrm;I think it's my fault.</i>

14:20.640 --> 14:23.040
<i>&lrm;I ruined her chances</i>
<i>&lrm;with a guy she likes.</i>

14:23.200 --> 14:24.280
&lrm;Lila?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.080
<i>&lrm;She's going to his house.</i>

14:26.240 --> 14:28.040
<i>&lrm;I'll send the address, meet me there.</i>

14:28.320 --> 14:29.240
&lrm;You got it.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.600
&lrm;I think I know the way.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.440
&lrm;[whooshing]

14:40.600 --> 14:43.160
&lrm;Wouldn't Cat Noir be more useful?

14:43.440 --> 14:47.360
&lrm;If Volpina's got a thing for me,
&lrm;I can make her see sense.

14:47.520 --> 14:51.360
&lrm;You think you can take down Volpina...
&lrm;without me?

14:52.680 --> 14:54.160
&lrm;Hide, Plagg. She's coming.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.280
&lrm;Adrien,

14:58.280 --> 15:00.240
&lrm;Hey. Who are you?

15:00.840 --> 15:02.440
&lrm;You remember this necklace?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.520
&lrm;I didn't know how to tell you

15:04.680 --> 15:06.960
&lrm;but this way you can see I'm not lying,

15:07.120 --> 15:08.560
&lrm;I am a superhero.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.160
&lrm;-Lila?
&lrm;-You can call me Volpina.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.320
&lrm;I'm sorry about the park earlier.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.400
&lrm;Ladybug's jealous
&lrm;because she's not as powerful as me.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.200
&lrm;You'll see Ladybug isn't just
&lrm;a figment of your imagination.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.240
&lrm;[bleeping]

15:22.400 --> 15:23.600
&lrm;What is he doing?

15:23.760 --> 15:25.200
&lrm;No time to hang around.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.520
&lrm;See what I mean?

15:29.680 --> 15:31.880
&lrm;She's jealous of me... of you, of us.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.000
&lrm;But this time
&lrm;you won't ruin our date, Ladybug.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.400
&lrm;Excuse me but it wasn't really a date...

15:39.280 --> 15:41.840
&lrm;I mean, it could've become one, right?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.480
&lrm;[Cat Noir] No need to get angry.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.640
&lrm;Excuse us,
&lrm;I need a chat with Super-liar.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.400
&lrm;You! Stop thinking
&lrm;your illusions are reality.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.720
&lrm;[Plagg] So, was I right, or was I right?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.360
&lrm;Come on. Claws out!

15:58.840 --> 16:00.120
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Sorry.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.440
&lrm;I had trouble finding the place.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.000
&lrm;Illusions?

16:12.160 --> 16:14.440
&lrm;Cat Noir, she's taken Adrien!

16:15.560 --> 16:17.880
&lrm;-It's an illusion.
&lrm;-How are you so sure?

16:18.400 --> 16:21.480
&lrm;My feline sixth sense. It's legendary.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.480
&lrm;Really? You don't say. Adrien's gone!

16:24.920 --> 16:27.200
&lrm;I'm not gonna try to get outta this.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.440
&lrm;[she cackles]

16:37.600 --> 16:40.880
&lrm;[panting]

16:41.520 --> 16:43.920
&lrm;Give me your Miraculous now,
&lrm;or I will.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.240
&lrm;I thought you loved him.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.960
&lrm;Not as much as seeing you two defeated.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.320
&lrm;No hard feelings.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.320
&lrm;It's a bluff. It's an illusion.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.000
&lrm;You wanna bet on that?

16:53.800 --> 16:55.200
&lrm;[humming]

16:55.360 --> 16:56.760
&lrm;No!

16:58.440 --> 16:59.880
&lrm;Don't do it, Ladybug.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.560
&lrm;No!

17:03.520 --> 17:04.560
&lrm;[she growls]

17:04.720 --> 17:06.079
&lrm;There she is!

17:15.480 --> 17:16.920
&lrm;[they gasp]

17:18.440 --> 17:20.119
&lrm;Lucky charm!

17:24.720 --> 17:25.920
&lrm;[gasping]

17:28.319 --> 17:30.480
&lrm;I've got an idea to take down Volpina.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.960
&lrm;-With a chocolate ice-lolly?
&lrm;-Trust me.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.000
&lrm;Cataclysm!

17:43.320 --> 17:44.360
&lrm;[he yells]

17:45.720 --> 17:47.040
&lrm;[crumbling]

17:47.200 --> 17:49.080
&lrm;[she gasps]

17:50.800 --> 17:52.400
&lrm;[Ladybug] Trapped, like a fox.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.760
&lrm;[she groans]

17:54.920 --> 17:56.120
&lrm;Your days are over, Akuma.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.520
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:08.920 --> 18:10.000
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:11.480 --> 18:12.760
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.760
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:22.560 --> 18:24.600
&lrm;-Lila?
&lrm;-Ladybug?

18:24.760 --> 18:26.960
&lrm;I totally overreacted

18:27.120 --> 18:30.760
&lrm;and never should have spoken
&lrm;to you like that. I'm sorry.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.000
&lrm;Forget it, Ladybug, you were right,

18:33.160 --> 18:34.600
&lrm;we'll never be friends.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.040
&lrm;[Cat Noir] That hurts.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.160
&lrm;She's still angry...

18:41.320 --> 18:44.360
&lrm;You're not done with Volpina yet, Ladybug.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.160
&lrm;You haven't seen the last of her!

18:50.000 --> 18:52.560
&lrm;There's one problem
&lrm;Where's Adrien?

18:52.720 --> 18:56.200
&lrm;Everything's back to normal,
&lrm;so he must be back at home.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.760
&lrm;I should check.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.960
&lrm;No! I'll go.
&lrm;You're about to change back.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.400
&lrm;[bleeping] So are you.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.280
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;No arguing. I'll take care of it.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.600
&lrm;[he sighs] That stubbornness.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.440
&lrm;It's so... so...

19:14.600 --> 19:16.320
&lrm;irresistible.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.960
&lrm;[he gasps]

19:24.320 --> 19:25.240
&lrm;Adrien?

19:27.080 --> 19:28.040
&lrm;Are you there?

19:28.480 --> 19:29.520
&lrm;Can I come in?

19:31.680 --> 19:33.920
&lrm;This is Ladybug.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.440
&lrm;Is everything OK?

19:36.080 --> 19:38.200
&lrm;Yeah. Needed a shower

19:38.360 --> 19:40.680
&lrm;-after all the excitement.
&lrm;-OK...

19:40.840 --> 19:42.280
&lrm;Sure.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.920
&lrm;-Sorry, I'll be off then.
&lrm;-Thank you.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.160
&lrm;[they sigh]

19:59.400 --> 20:00.760
&lrm;[he sighs]

20:00.920 --> 20:03.800
&lrm;This book could have been
&lrm;my connection to Adrien

20:03.960 --> 20:05.880
&lrm;without my mask for once.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.560
&lrm;But I get it,
&lrm;I'm not gonna be returning it.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.800
&lrm;I'm sorry, Marinette,
&lrm;but its information is invaluable.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.040
&lrm;Information? But it's all in code.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.880
&lrm;Someone's been looking
&lrm;for it for a long time.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.760
&lrm;He knows how to decipher it.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.680
&lrm;What's so special about this book?

20:22.840 --> 20:26.440
&lrm;It contains all the secrets
&lrm;of the Miraculous powers.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.040
&lrm;It's dangerous in the wrong hands.
&lrm;He needs it back.

20:29.400 --> 20:33.120
&lrm;I don't get it, Tikki.
&lrm;Tell me what's going on. Who is he?

20:33.520 --> 20:34.840
&lrm;The Great Guardian.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.160
&lrm;I think the time has come
&lrm;for you to meet him.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.040
&lrm;Did you take my book?

20:43.400 --> 20:44.920
&lrm;[chewing] Of course not.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.040
&lrm;If he finds out

20:46.200 --> 20:48.560
&lrm;it'll be worse than dealing
&lrm;with Hawk Moth.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.840
&lrm;Hello, Ladybug.
