WEBVTT

00:08.801 --> 00:11.094
We'll be arriving
in the Del Zennis system any moment.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.180
Well, we're coming up on the last
known position of our missing patrol,

00:14.264 --> 00:15.682
but I already checked the star charts.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.100
There's nothing out here.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.354
But obviously, that's not true
since the ship went missing,

00:21.438 --> 00:23.856
so, you know,
there must be something out here.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.859
When Captain Syndulla
said you volunteered for this mission,

00:26.944 --> 00:29.153
she insisted you could be helpful.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.155
Let us hope that is true.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.542
Something's about to happen.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.585
Commander, we've lost
hyperdrive control.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.837
Emergency positions.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.005
What's happening?
Are we under attack?

00:51.093 --> 00:52.593
We're being pulled out of hyperspace.

00:57.433 --> 01:00.017
Secure all stations
and get me status report.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.899
-Instruments have frozen!
-It's a Star Destroyer!

01:06.984 --> 01:09.026
No. That is something else.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.070
Send the distress signal. Now!

01:12.072 --> 01:13.239
Phoenix Home to Ghost.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.867
We've been pulled out of hyperspace.
The Empire...

01:32.009 --> 01:33.217
Phoenix Home to Ghost.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.720
We've been pulled out of hyperspace.
The Empire...

01:35.804 --> 01:37.472
The transmission was jammed.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.849
But still, that doesn't make any sense.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.684
You can't pull a ship out of hyperspace

01:41.769 --> 01:43.561
because you never know
exactly where it is.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.271
A tractor beam can't get a lock.

01:45.355 --> 01:48.483
That's 'cause this isn't a tractor beam.
It's a gravity well.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.610
When I was at the academy,
they were developing

01:50.694 --> 01:53.070
a new cruiser with
gravity well projectors

01:53.155 --> 01:56.115
powerful enough
to pull a ship out of hyperspace.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.533
Well, it looks like they finished it.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.203
Chances are they're
still testing the system.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.954
lf they follow Imperial procedure,

02:02.039 --> 02:04.832
the testing zone for this type of ship
wouldn't be that large.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.209
You'll probably find it not far

02:06.293 --> 02:08.211
from where we lost contact
with Commander Sato.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.295
All right, everybody. Gear up.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.088
We're goin' out there.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.799
Not everybody.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.675
You and Rex will go to that system.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.261
Find that ship,
and I bet you find Ezra and the others.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.889
Not Rex! I'll take Zeb or Sabine.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.266
Rex's military experience
will be invaluable

02:22.559 --> 02:25.102
and he can also
impersonate a stormtrooper.

02:25.187 --> 02:28.105
Right. That's because
he is a stormtrooper.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.067
-No, he was a clone trooper.
-Same thing.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.444
Kanan, I sent Ezra.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.029
This is the only way.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.990
All right. We'll get 'em back.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.742
All of them.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.918
Don't worry, Commander.
I'll get us out of this.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.670
I've been captured many times.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.922
You're not putting my mind at ease.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.924
Well, I've escaped a lot too.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.342
Obviously.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.347
Rebels.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.308
Out here searching
for your missing patrol, I assume.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.561
We are members of
the Corporate Alliance.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.980
You have taken possession
of my ships illegally,

03:09.064 --> 03:10.606
and I demand you release us.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.942
You are in a position
to demand nothing,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.777
Commander Sato.

03:15.487 --> 03:19.156
Yes. I am familiar
with your activities in this sector.

03:19.241 --> 03:22.368
I suspected if we captured
even one rebel ship,

03:22.452 --> 03:24.537
others would race to the rescue.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.831
But I dared not hope

03:26.915 --> 03:29.792
we'd capture someone
as significant as you.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.836
And what would
your name be, young man?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.170
Jabba the Hutt.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.380
Indeed.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.591
You are a tad small for a Hutt,

03:36.675 --> 03:40.136
but I know someone else
that goes by the name Jabba.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.762
Ezra Bridger.

03:41.847 --> 03:46.392
I imagine Agent Kallus will be quite
pleased to hear you have joined us.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.560
Secure them.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.235
Look, for the record,
this wasn't my idea.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.571
Just try to act like a professional.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.823
What if you get in there
and forget whose side you're on?

04:00.908 --> 04:04.744
I would never be on their side
or wear their junk armor.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.996
Here are your disguises.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.125
Perfect.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.420
This garbage
is nothing like clone armor.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.005
Looks a little tight on you, old man.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.633
Yeah? Well, at least
I know how to wear it.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.885
Kanan, Rex. Once you're in, signal me,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.554
and I'll come in with Phoenix Squadron
to blast you all out.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.640
How are we getting in anyway?

04:30.228 --> 04:33.105
How is it the Empire
lets us keep stealing these things?

04:33.190 --> 04:35.691
I thought it was the same one
we used before.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.948
I don't know why she does that.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.200
I believe it's called artistic expression.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.535
Yeah? Well, my expression is wrong.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.412
I'm not happy about
being on this mission.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.456
Really? That wasn't clear.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.001
Once we board this thing,
Chopper will plug in,

04:54.086 --> 04:55.753
find out where they have our people,

04:55.837 --> 04:57.046
and we get them out of there.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.465
We've got to disable
this weapon, whatever it is.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.010
lf the Empire is able to
intercept our ships in hyperspace,

05:03.095 --> 05:05.096
this rebel movement won't last long.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.389
I hear what you're saying,

05:06.473 --> 05:10.142
but remember, this is a
rescue mission, first and foremost.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.269
We're coming up on Ezra's
last known position.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.730
Let's just hope
we can find that ship fast.

05:20.404 --> 05:23.114
Shuttle S257, this is a restricted area.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.242
Copy that, sir.
Boy, are we glad to see you.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.620
We have a 157. Repeat, a 157.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.122
You are not cleared.

05:31.206 --> 05:35.334
This is a 675 test zone
and off-limits to you, S257.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.837
Well, if we don't get some help soon,

05:37.921 --> 05:40.506
we're gonna have a 3376 on our hands.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.925
I don't think you're gonna
want to have a 3376

05:43.010 --> 05:44.802
off your starboard side,
now, would you, sir?

05:44.886 --> 05:48.180
Shuttle S257, requesting
your emergency access code.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.100
Copy that, sir. Priority protocol 7...

05:51.893 --> 05:55.187
This is the stuff I can't stand,
protocol nonsense.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.731
Stand by for code check.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.400
Cody and I practically
invented these emergency protocols

05:59.484 --> 06:00.568
back in the Clone War.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.195
Trust me, the codes are good.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.369
Copy, Shuttle S257.

06:10.454 --> 06:14.373
You are clear to proceed
on heading 1599 to hangar 11.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.916
Thank you, sir.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.586
See? They don't suspect a thing.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.770
Agent Kallus.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.439
Our new gravity weapon
reeled in a catch of rebels

06:38.523 --> 06:40.483
who I believe you're familiar with,

06:40.567 --> 06:45.237
Commander Jun Sato and a young
one who calls himself Jabba.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.532
You have Ezra Bridger?
Excellent work, Admiral.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.077
Lock him in a secure cell
under triple guard.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.163
-Triple guard? He is but a child.
-I warn you.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.999
Do not underestimate that boy.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.876
I'm certain that the Imperial Navy

06:58.960 --> 07:01.045
is more than a match for one boy,

07:01.129 --> 07:02.713
whatever he calls himself.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.091
We shall see. I'm on my way.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.429
Well, all set?

07:10.514 --> 07:11.764
I guess.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.976
This must be just like old times.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.187
Just follow my lead and you'll be okay.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.980
No, you follow my lead.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.824
Command deck says you need to make
your repairs and depart.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.201
We need to get to maintenance.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.246
You need to get to maintenance.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.123
We can go on our way.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.208
You can go on your way.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.132
Not bad. I've seen better.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.384
Maybe I'll practice on you some time.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.095
Chopper, plug in
and find Ezra and the crew.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.600
Transferring him to a secure cell?

07:56.685 --> 07:59.019
That means
they know who he is. Let's go!

08:09.072 --> 08:10.906
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hit the button.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.742
Which... Which button?
I don't know where it is.

08:14.578 --> 08:15.578
No.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.916
Your armor appears to be
a little tight, trooper.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.171
I'll tighten your face a little tighter.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.548
-What was that?
-Possible hyper-sickness.

08:27.632 --> 08:32.720
I'm taking 565 here on the 257.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.305
The commissary?

08:34.389 --> 08:37.016
That's the last place I'd take him.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.227
Yeah. I'm gonna take you...
Commissary...

08:43.773 --> 08:45.441
Move along, rebel.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.362
Hey, just so you know,
when I escape, I won't hurt any of you.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.865
Yeah, that's great, kid. I feel real safe.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.491
You shouldn't.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.930
You see? You're fine.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.064
Chopper?

09:28.818 --> 09:29.818
Wait...

09:31.196 --> 09:32.321
No.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.369
Kanan!

09:39.663 --> 09:40.663
Rex.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.039
Rex, come on!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.542
What just happened?

09:46.294 --> 09:48.003
Did you see them?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.589
We were so outnumbered.
There was a firefight.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.716
A big firefight, actually.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.176
You guys fought great.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.304
Thanks. All I saw was you.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.852
You shot us! I can't believe you shot us!

10:03.937 --> 10:06.397
I mean, you... You were
dressed like stormtroopers.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.190
-Yeah!
-You shot us.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.485
I set it to stun.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.696
-Yeah, well, you should've used kill.
-What?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.781
Well, just in case it wasn't us. I mean...

10:15.865 --> 10:17.950
This armor doesn't
protect you from anything.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.368
Well, I told you.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.703
Now's not the time.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.372
We gotta find Sato
and sabotage this ship.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.541
They have this
gravity weapon thing that...

10:25.959 --> 10:28.460
-You know all this.
-So what's your plan?

10:28.545 --> 10:30.129
Well, we should probably split up.

10:30.213 --> 10:33.465
I'll take Chopper, and he can get me
to the reactor that powers this thing.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.426
You two bust out Sato.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.969
We are not splitting up.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.971
Let's get Sato and get out of here.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.181
The kid's right.
We have to destroy this ship.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.475
Do you know how many
stormtroopers are heading this way?

10:43.560 --> 10:44.935
-It doesn't matter.
-Can't afford to separate.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.520
We have to protect the fleet.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.314
Will you two quit it already?

10:48.398 --> 10:50.149
Part of the reason I took this mission

10:50.233 --> 10:52.526
was to get a break from this!

10:52.694 --> 10:54.903
Okay, Chopper and I
will meet you at Sato's ship.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.158
He takes after Hera sometimes.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.129
Sir, we've had a breach
in the detention level.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.173
The prisoner known
as Jabba has escaped.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.674
Lock all levels down.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.843
Sweep the vessel
and secure the hangar bays.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.094
Yes, sir.

11:19.679 --> 11:23.390
And, Commander,
when you find the boy, eliminate him.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.602
I would hate it if
we proved Agent Kallus right.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.937
Yes, sir. Right away.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.148
Locking down. Secure detention block.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.524
One of the rebels has escaped.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.401
Do not attempt capture.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.028
Eliminate the target.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.196
I got this one.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.240
We don't have time for another one
of your long-winded bluffs.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.700
You got a better plan?

11:41.785 --> 11:43.577
-Yeah.
-Well, what is it?

11:43.661 --> 11:44.787
This!

11:50.001 --> 11:51.251
So much for stealth.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.796
It's not like they don't know we're here.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.023
That must be the reactor core
for the gravity weapon.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.401
What? You have a plan?

12:16.778 --> 12:17.903
I'm the bait.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.156
Okay. Okay. I'll draw them away.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.867
Most of the time
they ignore droids anyway.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.553
Hold it!

12:44.806 --> 12:46.014
We've got an intruder.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.559
Come and get me!

13:03.491 --> 13:04.867
They've shut off gravity!

13:05.326 --> 13:07.411
This wasn't part of the plan!

13:25.597 --> 13:28.599
Don't you dare! Don't you do it! Not yet!

13:39.903 --> 13:41.737
You better have sabotaged it.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.031
What do you mean, you think you did?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.074
Hey!

13:52.290 --> 13:54.666
Never expected to make it
this far with you for a partner.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.835
You know, you're not
the first Jedi I've fought beside.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.337
But probably the last.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.382
You really do shoot like a stormtrooper.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.468
Guess I don't have
too much to worry about.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.053
It's this helmet.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.554
I can't see!

14:12.310 --> 14:14.102
-Commander.
-Kanan.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.313
They're keeping Ezra in a separate cell.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.649
-We have to find him.
-Ezra's doing fine.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.817
You mean he escaped? On his own?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.903
Yeah. He tends to do that.

14:24.239 --> 14:27.616
We don't have time for this.
I'll pull, you fire.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.034
Just like old times.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.702
Settle down, Captain.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.956
-What's going on?
-I can't stop!

14:41.422 --> 14:43.799
Kanan. We're on our way back.
Where are you?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.801
-We're headed for Sato's ship.
-Roger that.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.891
There's too many of them!

14:52.976 --> 14:54.726
I'm too old for all this running.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.228
-What are you doing?
-Get those men out of here.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.312
They need you.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.606
I can slow them down. Now go!

14:59.691 --> 15:01.066
Stop trying to impress me.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.401
I'm not trying to impress you!

15:02.485 --> 15:03.610
I'll see you back at the ship.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.425
Cell block AA-24 is compromised.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.760
Escaped prisoners
last seen on level four.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.013
They're impersonating
our security personnel!

15:33.725 --> 15:35.017
A clone.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.727
You're a bright one.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.395
I had your number scanned.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.857
7567, Captain Rex.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.609
You were a hero once.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.445
You and your kind
brought peace to the galaxy.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.031
Why would you lower yourself
to fight with traitors?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.574
Where is your loyalty?

15:51.159 --> 15:55.454
My loyalty was to the Republic,
not your Empire.

15:55.913 --> 15:59.583
I serve the order
you put into place, Captain.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.377
I believe you want to do the right thing.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.798
Surrender all your compatriots
and I will offer you not only immunity,

16:06.883 --> 16:10.177
but reinstatement at an
Imperial training academy.

16:10.261 --> 16:14.222
You could wear that armor
and be proud of your service again.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.974
I'm proud of my service.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.185
But I really hate this armor.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.481
That's unfortunate,
because you are going to die in it.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.579
We sabotaged the reactor.
Let's get out of here.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.498
Get Sato and his crew
to the blockade runner.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.749
Where are you going?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.918
I've gotta get my friend.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.713
-Wait. Friend?
-We can't get through.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.006
Where is Kanan going?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.008
Don't worry. I've got this.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.760
You've got this?

17:06.401 --> 17:07.776
Hey!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.611
Come on! He's got this.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.539
I am going to terminate you

17:20.623 --> 17:23.291
not like a soldier or honored veteran.

17:24.043 --> 17:28.004
No. You will be discarded and forgotten,

17:28.089 --> 17:31.341
like an obsolete
piece of field equipment.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.428
And no one will know or care.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.971
I will.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.182
Stop them!

17:48.484 --> 17:50.902
Wow. Nice to know you care.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.028
Don't ruin this.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.996
The whole ship's
between us and that hangar.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.373
Ezra, tell Sato to take off.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.250
No way. We're not leaving.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.627
Just do it. We've got another way out.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.922
-We've got to get back to the ship.
-No time.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.674
Then how are we getting out of here?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.762
Escape pods.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.646
We're free of the docking clamps,

18:26.731 --> 18:29.357
but Imperial reinforcements are
trying to cut their way onto the ship.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.651
-Where are the others?
-Kanan ordered us to go.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.903
He said they have another way out.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.780
Pilot, disengage.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.454
Sir, the rebel ship is escaping.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.581
Shall I order our cruisers to intercept?

18:44.665 --> 18:46.875
Prepare to fire the gravity wells.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.058
Hey, you sabotaged that thing, right?

19:03.226 --> 19:05.227
Of course we did. Right, Chop?

19:06.354 --> 19:07.437
Fire.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.857
Gravity projectors engaged.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.569
Make the jump.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.744
We are caught! Again!

19:23.329 --> 19:25.831
Chopper! You said you sabotaged it.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.085
What do you mean,
"Wait for it"? Wait for what?

19:31.963 --> 19:33.463
Sir. The weapon is malfunctioning.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.090
It's drawing in our cruisers, too.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.266
Chopper's rigged
their own weapon against them.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.185
-It's pulling everything in.
-Including us!

20:06.998 --> 20:08.039
Commander! We're free!

20:23.097 --> 20:24.890
Now you're the big hero?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.475
It was a team effort.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.280
Sir, we found something.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.073
Agent Kallus.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.241
Admiral.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.244
Had some problems with the boy, I see.

20:52.835 --> 20:56.463
Gentlemen, my crew and I
owe you our gratitude.

20:56.547 --> 20:57.756
All three of you.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.092
Thanks, Commander. You know,
when you two aren't fighting each other,

21:01.177 --> 21:03.553
you fight really well together,
Jedi and clones.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.096
Now I get it.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.808
Kids. You know, crazy ideas.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.269
Yeah. You know...

21:11.354 --> 21:14.606
-Thanks.
-Yeah. Yeah. I know.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.442
Well, I guess there's
nothing more to say about it.

21:18.653 --> 21:19.903
Hey, Rex.
