WEBVTT

00:01.119 --> 00:02.929
My name is Eobard Thawne.

00:02.932 --> 00:04.406
With the help of Damien Darhk,

00:04.409 --> 00:05.367
Malcolm Merlyn,

00:05.370 --> 00:06.869
Leonard Snart, and Mick Rory,

00:06.872 --> 00:08.812
I've obtained the Spear of Destiny...

00:08.815 --> 00:10.536
An ancient artifact with the power

00:10.538 --> 00:14.273
to rewrite reality itself, and we have.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.495
It's a brave new world.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

01:01.089 --> 01:02.355
Aah!

01:17.572 --> 01:18.604
Whoops!

01:27.515 --> 01:29.182
The Mayor would like a word,

01:29.184 --> 01:31.284
Miss Smoak.

01:31.286 --> 01:33.085
Then maybe he should've
come down here himself

01:33.087 --> 01:35.478
instead of sending the bimbo brigade.

01:35.481 --> 01:36.956
Rude!

01:37.892 --> 01:39.859
Uhh!

01:41.162 --> 01:42.862
Well done, ladies.

01:42.864 --> 01:45.765
Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.834
Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.

01:47.836 --> 01:51.804
Yes, but you do it so well,
and with such... style.

01:51.806 --> 01:56.175
And you've done a bang-up job
dealing with my... pest problem,

01:56.177 --> 01:58.077
though that term may
be giving you vigilantes

01:58.079 --> 02:00.780
a little too much credit.

02:00.782 --> 02:02.682
Even a cockroach knows when to pack up

02:02.684 --> 02:04.283
and head out of Dodge.

02:04.285 --> 02:08.354
Star City is my home. I
will never stop fighting.

02:08.356 --> 02:10.156
Sure you will.

02:10.157 --> 02:11.390
Kill her.

02:14.729 --> 02:16.562
Hmm.

02:16.564 --> 02:17.730
Get rid of that.

02:17.732 --> 02:21.367
Oh, but I will take this mask...

02:21.369 --> 02:24.570
so I can add it to my collection.

02:28.177 --> 02:33.188
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and Corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:34.716 --> 02:36.616
No, I will not take a seat

02:36.618 --> 02:38.351
and wait for him to have an opening.

02:38.353 --> 02:40.987
He can make time for me
now. Can't you, Eobard?

02:40.989 --> 02:42.622
I'm so sorry, Mr. Thawne.

02:42.624 --> 02:44.390
He insisted.

02:49.597 --> 02:52.331
I see your friend is
still putting up a fight.

02:52.333 --> 02:56.469
He'll give up. All caged
animals do eventually.

02:58.806 --> 03:01.540
Now, tell me why you've flown
all the way out here again.

03:01.542 --> 03:04.277
You keep ignoring my
requests for a meeting.

03:04.279 --> 03:06.946
Because there's no reason for one.

03:06.948 --> 03:08.814
Our partnership has ended.

03:08.816 --> 03:10.150
You got what you wanted.

03:10.153 --> 03:13.619
Your wife and your son are
both alive and in good spirits.

03:13.621 --> 03:15.688
Your daughter Thea adores you.

03:15.690 --> 03:19.125
Nyssa al Ghul is trapped in
a miserable, closeted life

03:19.127 --> 03:21.460
in the middle of Ohio, and hey,

03:21.462 --> 03:23.596
you can even clap again.

03:23.598 --> 03:25.131
What more could you possibly want?

03:25.133 --> 03:27.199
How about the Spear of Destiny?

03:27.201 --> 03:28.868
There are still some
things in this world

03:28.870 --> 03:30.184
that I would like to see change.

03:30.187 --> 03:31.971
How many times do I have
to tell you this, Malcolm?

03:31.973 --> 03:34.373
The Spear is safest in my hands.

03:34.375 --> 03:37.176
Besides, I'm the only one
who knows how to use it.

03:37.178 --> 03:40.279
That's because you destroyed
the Kalabros Manuscript.

03:40.281 --> 03:41.547
Well, it's not my fault

03:41.549 --> 03:43.549
you don't retain information like I do.

03:43.551 --> 03:45.751
Speedster brains are handy that way.

03:46.738 --> 03:48.305
Mr. Jackson is here to see you.

03:49.557 --> 03:50.923
Send him in.

03:50.925 --> 03:52.992
Good morning, Mr. Thawne.

03:52.994 --> 03:55.895
Jefferson.

03:55.897 --> 03:57.930
How are things down at the lab?

03:57.932 --> 04:00.099
There was a minor setback,

04:00.101 --> 04:03.135
but the situation is under control.

04:03.137 --> 04:05.137
You promised me results.

04:05.139 --> 04:07.406
And you will have them.

04:07.408 --> 04:10.176
I just need to motivate
my employee a little more.

04:11.846 --> 04:15.047
But another test will be
up and running this evening.

04:15.049 --> 04:18.817
I hope so, for his sake...

04:18.820 --> 04:21.786
and yours.

04:21.789 --> 04:23.689
Yes.

04:25.426 --> 04:27.226
I don't know why

04:27.228 --> 04:29.595
you and Damien insist on
toying with the Legends.

04:29.597 --> 04:32.365
It's sloppy. They should
be wiped from existence.

04:32.367 --> 04:34.467
I prefer this arrangement.

04:34.469 --> 04:36.469
I believe it's called "poetic justice."

04:36.471 --> 04:39.438
And, uh, what is this
project you're working on?

04:39.440 --> 04:42.508
I'm a man of science, Malcolm.

04:42.510 --> 04:46.379
I'm compelled to innovate,
invent, and inspire.

04:46.381 --> 04:49.982
A genius brain needs a genius challenge.

04:49.984 --> 04:53.219
Now go. Enjoy your
family, spend your wealth.

04:53.221 --> 04:55.721
The world is as it should be.

04:55.723 --> 04:58.057
Be satisfied with your spoils.

04:58.059 --> 05:01.927
The others are having
the time of their lives.

05:05.752 --> 05:07.551
Stop! Hold it right there!

05:09.037 --> 05:11.904
Cool it, Mick. We already
got what we came for.

05:11.906 --> 05:13.973
Just heating things up.

05:13.975 --> 05:16.342
Don't move! Both of you on the ground!

05:16.344 --> 05:18.844
Mr. Snart. Sorry, sir.

05:18.846 --> 05:21.080
We didn't realize it was you.

05:22.050 --> 05:23.516
Carry on.

05:26.087 --> 05:29.522
What the hell's going
on? No roasting pigs?

05:29.524 --> 05:32.326
No need. We're home free, buddy.

05:32.329 --> 05:34.060
It's good to be the king.

05:34.062 --> 05:36.228
No getaway, no chase?

05:36.230 --> 05:38.731
You want a chase, I can arrange a chase.

05:38.733 --> 05:40.366
Even get us tossed in Iron Heights,

05:40.368 --> 05:42.668
and we can plan an escape
just like old times.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.303
- How does that sound?
- Boring!

05:44.305 --> 05:46.205
Well, we could hit up
the Central City Bank.

05:46.207 --> 05:49.075
They've got a fancy new vault
I've been dying to crack.

05:49.077 --> 05:50.543
What's the point?

05:50.545 --> 05:52.478
You own the bank and half the city.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.680
You mean we own half the city, Mick.

05:54.682 --> 05:57.049
We're partners, remember?

05:57.051 --> 05:58.317
Mm.

05:58.319 --> 06:00.986
Seems our next score will have to wait.

06:00.988 --> 06:03.089
Thawne is...

06:03.091 --> 06:04.730
summoning us.

06:04.733 --> 06:06.725
Since when do we get summoned?

06:06.727 --> 06:08.661
Since the man agreed not to erase

06:08.663 --> 06:11.363
you and your friends from existence.

06:17.805 --> 06:21.574
Gideon, I've finally
perfected my fondant bows.

06:27.548 --> 06:28.881
What do you think?

06:28.883 --> 06:30.516
Your technique has vastly improved

06:30.518 --> 06:32.852
over the last year,
Captain. These cakes are

06:32.854 --> 06:34.787
so much more creative
than your biscuits.

06:34.789 --> 06:36.689
Now, credit where credit is due, Gideon.

06:36.691 --> 06:39.492
Your idea of adding more gelatin
to the mixture was pivotal.

06:39.494 --> 06:42.495
Well done. The best one
yet, in my humble opinion.

06:42.497 --> 06:44.330
It's a shame that you're

06:44.332 --> 06:45.824
the only one here to appreciate it.

06:45.827 --> 06:49.101
I'm sure your team would
be just as impressed.

06:49.103 --> 06:51.036
Assuming that they're all still alive.

06:51.038 --> 06:52.905
Perhaps you should resume your efforts

06:52.907 --> 06:54.140
to send a message out.

06:54.142 --> 06:55.741
What's the point, Gideon?

06:55.743 --> 06:57.676
The Legion have the Spear of Destiny!

06:57.678 --> 06:59.311
They're like gods now!

06:59.313 --> 07:02.915
There's no point in fighting.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.184
Not anymore.

07:18.733 --> 07:20.799
Stein!

07:22.403 --> 07:23.584
Yes, Mr. Jackson?

07:23.587 --> 07:28.073
What's this I hear about
you taking tomorrow off?

07:28.075 --> 07:30.776
It's Saturday, sir, and
it's my daughter's birthday.

07:30.778 --> 07:34.947
Oh. Well, of course. Take the day off.

07:34.949 --> 07:38.651
In fact, why don't you
take the whole week off?

07:38.653 --> 07:40.052
Really?

07:40.054 --> 07:41.466
Of course.

07:41.469 --> 07:45.724
I mean, the project's ready
for Mr. Thawne to use, correct?

07:45.726 --> 07:48.760
- Well, in fact...
- In fact, old man,

07:48.763 --> 07:50.461
you will not be leaving this building

07:50.464 --> 07:52.298
until Mr. Thawne sees results.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.533
I-I have been working
nonstop for the past month.

07:54.535 --> 07:56.735
I haven't seen my wife
and daughter in weeks.

07:58.272 --> 08:00.639
You want to see your family?

08:00.641 --> 08:03.842
Then you will get that reactor
working by tomorrow night.

08:03.844 --> 08:05.578
It's impossible.
There's too much data...

08:05.580 --> 08:07.446
Get it working!

08:07.448 --> 08:11.350
Or you will never see that
precious family of yours again.

08:13.264 --> 08:16.532
Somebody clean this place
up! It's a damn mess.

08:23.464 --> 08:25.698
I'm so sorry, may I help you with that?

08:28.703 --> 08:31.870
Oh. No worries, man. I got it.

08:34.942 --> 08:37.342
Yes, Mr. President,
you know I'll be there.

08:37.345 --> 08:39.278
You know I love receiving medals.

08:40.715 --> 08:43.015
And then, uh, golf on Sunday.

08:43.017 --> 08:45.184
And dinner at your hotel after?

08:46.847 --> 08:49.221
All right, all right, best to Mel.

08:49.223 --> 08:50.456
Bye-bye.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.025
I am so sorry. I had to take that.

08:53.027 --> 08:54.593
There's only so many times you can tell

08:54.595 --> 08:55.993
the President of the United States

08:55.996 --> 08:57.204
that you'll call him back.

08:57.207 --> 08:59.231
- You want to get to the point?
- Yes.

08:59.233 --> 09:04.136
I brought you here to
discuss a... sensitive matter,

09:04.138 --> 09:06.939
and it goes by the
name of Malcolm Merlyn.

09:06.941 --> 09:08.240
What about him?

09:08.242 --> 09:09.775
Want you to keep an eye on him for me.

09:09.777 --> 09:11.810
We're not your watchdogs.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.213
Hmm. What was that?

09:14.215 --> 09:17.850
What he meant was, we're
not spies. We're thieves.

09:17.852 --> 09:20.419
Mr. Thawne, I need to speak with you!

09:21.707 --> 09:23.589
I just need five minutes of your time.

09:23.591 --> 09:24.722
Please.

09:24.725 --> 09:27.493
Reality's at stake.
The world isn't right.

09:29.730 --> 09:31.118
Okay, let him go. Let him go.

09:31.121 --> 09:34.500
Let's just... let's
see what he has to say.

09:34.502 --> 09:35.901
It's okay.

09:35.903 --> 09:39.271
He intentionally hit me in the ribs.

09:39.273 --> 09:42.041
First of all, awesome office.

09:42.043 --> 09:44.009
I guess it pays to be the
smartest man in the world,

09:44.011 --> 09:47.246
which is why I've come to you for help.

09:47.248 --> 09:50.282
You were saying that
the world isn't right.

09:50.284 --> 09:52.985
Yeah, this world we're in now is wrong.

09:52.987 --> 09:56.722
Reality has, uh, has changed somehow.

09:57.725 --> 09:59.792
How do you know all this?

09:59.794 --> 10:01.960
Um, well, there's signs everywhere

10:01.962 --> 10:05.230
if you know where to look.
There's subtle inconsistencies

10:05.232 --> 10:08.267
in the fabric... of reality.

10:08.269 --> 10:10.903
Um, I call 'em scars.

10:10.905 --> 10:13.205
You know, like, after
you've been operated on.

10:13.207 --> 10:17.843
Well, um, reality has been operated on.

10:19.013 --> 10:20.679
Truly fascinating.

10:20.681 --> 10:23.048
I'm giddy with excitement.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.483
What's that got to do with him?

10:24.485 --> 10:27.786
Well, um, Mr. Thawne
could help me fix it.

10:27.788 --> 10:29.955
Look, right, you're a genius.

10:29.957 --> 10:33.025
You figured out cold fusion.
You saved the polar bears,

10:33.027 --> 10:34.626
you fixed global warming.

10:34.628 --> 10:37.329
I mean, you made
desalination sustainable.

10:37.331 --> 10:41.500
I mean, you solve problems
like this, like, every day.

10:41.502 --> 10:45.771
If anyone... anyone can figure
out why these scars exist

10:45.773 --> 10:49.274
and how to put the world
back to the way it was...

10:49.276 --> 10:51.810
it's you, dude.

10:54.782 --> 10:57.483
You know what?

10:57.485 --> 10:59.385
I think you're on to something.

10:59.387 --> 11:00.519
Ah.

11:00.521 --> 11:02.312
Something is definitely

11:02.315 --> 11:03.589
not right here.

11:03.591 --> 11:06.258
Fix it. Take mister...

11:06.260 --> 11:07.626
- Heywood.
- Mr. Heywood.

11:07.628 --> 11:10.162
Take Mr. Heywood out for some fresh air.

11:10.164 --> 11:11.797
And, uh, kill him.

11:14.268 --> 11:15.734
Me?

11:19.511 --> 11:20.876
Look, I don't understand.

11:20.879 --> 11:23.741
If this is about my work,
nobody pays attention to it.

11:23.744 --> 11:25.543
My mom's the only person
that reads my blog.

11:25.545 --> 11:27.712
Stop talking.

11:27.714 --> 11:32.817
Guys, I am not a threat to
anyone... unless I'm right.

11:36.456 --> 11:37.822
Am I right?

11:37.824 --> 11:40.058
Sounds like fitting final words to me.

11:40.060 --> 11:45.630
Whatever... science or magic
altered reality must have left

11:45.632 --> 11:48.733
small scars on my memory that
my subconscious picked up on.

11:48.735 --> 11:51.303
So if I'm not a conspiracy theorist

11:51.305 --> 11:53.405
no one listens to, then...

11:54.875 --> 11:55.907
Who am I?

11:55.909 --> 11:56.975
- Dead.
- Wait.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.476
- What?
- He said, "Wait."

11:58.478 --> 12:00.545
I heard him. He said, "Wait."

12:00.547 --> 12:03.315
You promised me things were
gonna be like old times.

12:03.317 --> 12:05.884
It is like old times, only better.

12:05.886 --> 12:08.386
Central City is ours. No more Flash.

12:08.388 --> 12:10.755
Except another speedster's
calling the shots.

12:10.757 --> 12:12.257
You leave Thawne to me.

12:12.259 --> 12:14.292
I always have a plan. You know this.

12:14.294 --> 12:15.560
Well, fill me in.

12:15.562 --> 12:17.128
When the time is right.

12:17.130 --> 12:18.930
Ah, yes, we're partners,

12:18.932 --> 12:21.933
except when you refuse to
tell me what's going on.

12:25.772 --> 12:27.305
You son of a...

12:30.310 --> 12:33.144
Sorry, buddy. I owed you that.

12:34.047 --> 12:37.048
You saved my life. Why?

12:38.218 --> 12:40.485
Because I'm an idiot.

12:40.487 --> 12:43.888
This could be one of my scars talking,

12:43.890 --> 12:47.359
but I'm sensing you're
telling me the truth.

12:47.361 --> 12:49.594
Let's move.

12:49.596 --> 12:50.962
Okay.

12:55.902 --> 12:58.636
This is crazier than
any of my crazy theories.

12:58.638 --> 13:02.240
You're trying to tell me a group
called "The Legion of Doom"

13:02.243 --> 13:04.509
you something called
it "Spearing of Destiny"

13:04.511 --> 13:06.411
to rewrite reality?

13:06.413 --> 13:09.114
Who even names something
"Legion of Doom"?

13:09.116 --> 13:10.315
You did.

13:10.317 --> 13:12.650
Me?

13:12.652 --> 13:14.686
Now, do you only
remember the old reality

13:14.688 --> 13:17.122
because you're part of the Legion?

13:17.124 --> 13:19.891
I'm not part of anything.

13:19.893 --> 13:22.360
I just made a terrible mistake.

13:35.175 --> 13:36.741
You filthy aliens.

13:36.743 --> 13:39.477
Come on, wait a minute.

13:39.479 --> 13:41.179
This is the guy who's gonna fix reality?

13:41.181 --> 13:43.415
- Uh-huh.
- Uh...

13:43.417 --> 13:46.418
who are you guys, and, um,
what are you doing here?

13:46.420 --> 13:47.733
We need your help.

13:47.736 --> 13:49.487
What do you got, like, a
clogged toilet or something?

13:49.489 --> 13:51.389
'Cause, you know,
I'm... I'm off duty now.

13:51.391 --> 13:53.158
You're not a janitor.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.393
Yeah, I am, man. It
says so on my name...

13:55.395 --> 13:56.694
On my name tag.

13:56.696 --> 14:00.365
You're a geek, a nerd, a genius.

14:00.367 --> 14:02.100
That's why we're here.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.735
Oh, is this about the dipole magnets

14:03.737 --> 14:05.136
that I borrowed from S.T.A.R. Labs?

14:05.138 --> 14:06.771
'Cause I'm totally gonna return those.

14:06.773 --> 14:08.473
Look, man,

14:08.475 --> 14:10.875
he said you're the one
that could fix this reality.

14:10.877 --> 14:12.944
Fix this reality?

14:12.946 --> 14:14.412
What do you mean?

14:14.414 --> 14:16.848
You guys think there's
something wrong too?

14:16.850 --> 14:18.216
- Whoa.
- Oh!

14:18.218 --> 14:19.784
That's... that's private stuff, man.

14:19.786 --> 14:20.819
What is it?

14:20.821 --> 14:22.620
Um, I don't know exactly.

14:22.621 --> 14:24.783
I mean... I mean, I think
I know, but I don't...

14:24.786 --> 14:26.752
Spit it out, haircut.

14:26.755 --> 14:29.727
Well, um, I ki...

14:29.729 --> 14:31.629
I kinda built it on impulse.

14:31.631 --> 14:34.382
You know, like, on instinct.

14:34.385 --> 14:38.166
I call it, uh, a
Transreality Multiplexer.

14:38.169 --> 14:41.070
No real reason. Just
thought it sounded cool.

14:41.073 --> 14:42.832
Don't you get it, man?

14:42.835 --> 14:47.078
Your impulse was a reality scar
working on your subconscious.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.246
Reality scar.

14:48.248 --> 14:50.014
So, uh, what does this fun gun do?

14:50.016 --> 14:52.050
Uh, theoretically,

14:52.052 --> 14:54.886
it targets irregularities
in the hippocampus,

14:54.888 --> 14:57.822
acting like a "Control-Z" for memories.

14:57.824 --> 14:59.390
"Control-Z"?

14:59.392 --> 15:01.392
Like an undo command on a computer.

15:01.394 --> 15:02.660
Oh.

15:02.662 --> 15:03.995
Well, I was gonna try the new version

15:03.997 --> 15:05.330
on my latest test subject,

15:05.332 --> 15:08.533
but then I was worried
it might melt his brain.

15:09.336 --> 15:10.468
Axel.

15:10.470 --> 15:12.303
No, it's Tesla, actually.

15:12.305 --> 15:13.872
He looks more like an Indiana to me.

15:13.874 --> 15:15.607
No, he's Axel.

15:15.609 --> 15:18.476
You gave me that little
guy for Christmas.

15:18.478 --> 15:20.879
You haven't been running
any tests on him, have you?

15:20.881 --> 15:22.313
What? No.

15:23.383 --> 15:26.184
Whoa. Whoa! No, no! No!

15:26.186 --> 15:27.418
All right, I think
actually for it to work

15:27.420 --> 15:28.786
you have to shoot him in the head.

15:28.788 --> 15:29.888
Why would you say that?

15:29.890 --> 15:32.123
Hey, how many people

15:32.125 --> 15:33.858
are gonna point guns at me today?

15:37.097 --> 15:38.763
Oh, my God, you killed him!

15:44.838 --> 15:46.638
You son of a bitch.

15:49.676 --> 15:52.010
It works.

15:52.012 --> 15:54.379
So, Mr. Rory's having second thoughts?

15:54.381 --> 15:58.316
Mick's just a little
confused. I can control him.

15:58.318 --> 15:59.551
Obviously you can't.

15:59.553 --> 16:01.286
Yes, I can.

16:01.288 --> 16:04.589
I just need your help getting
him back on the reservation,

16:04.591 --> 16:06.991
before Thawne finds out.

16:06.993 --> 16:08.726
We have bigger problems.

16:08.728 --> 16:10.895
What if Heywood's only the
first of his old teammates

16:10.897 --> 16:13.264
Mr. Rory's feeling nostalgic for?

16:13.266 --> 16:15.066
I knew we should've killed them all.

16:15.068 --> 16:16.946
It was a dangerous oversight

16:16.949 --> 16:19.104
to keep them alive in any capacity.

16:19.105 --> 16:20.738
Does that include Mick?

16:20.740 --> 16:24.175
At the very least we
should've wiped his brain,

16:24.177 --> 16:25.910
such as it is.

16:25.912 --> 16:28.213
You trusted your buddy
a little too much.

16:28.215 --> 16:29.981
Calm yourself, Malcolm.

16:29.983 --> 16:32.884
We'll have Mr. Rory back
before he does too much damage.

16:34.354 --> 16:35.720
Yes, boss?

16:36.923 --> 16:38.990
Mick Rory's got himself lost.

16:38.992 --> 16:40.892
Find him, would you?

16:42.996 --> 16:45.063
Where do you suggest
we start our search?

16:45.065 --> 16:49.234
You can track him with
this. I put a GPS in Mick.

16:50.904 --> 16:53.137
I don't trust anyone.

16:55.842 --> 16:57.008
Okay, on the count of three.

16:57.010 --> 16:58.209
One...

16:58.211 --> 16:59.644
two...

17:03.416 --> 17:05.215
Oh.

17:05.218 --> 17:06.617
You!

17:10.423 --> 17:11.756
I deserved that.

17:11.758 --> 17:13.358
Damn straight you did.

17:13.361 --> 17:16.194
Hey, if it wasn't for
me, you'd all be dead.

17:16.195 --> 17:17.428
Yeah, Mick, thanks a lot.

17:17.430 --> 17:19.530
You trapped each of us
in our own personal hell.

17:19.531 --> 17:22.666
Do you have any idea how
many toilets I've cleaned?

17:24.104 --> 17:25.603
So many.

17:32.178 --> 17:33.344
Amaya.

17:33.346 --> 17:34.579
Sara.

17:34.581 --> 17:36.047
Hey, dumbasses,

17:36.049 --> 17:37.982
they have no clue who you are.

17:37.984 --> 17:40.418
They work for Damien Darhk.

17:42.289 --> 17:43.621
Oh!

17:43.623 --> 17:45.290
Crap.

17:53.385 --> 17:55.192
I don't like the way
she's looking at us.

17:55.194 --> 17:57.161
I like the way she's looking at us.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.785
Love the suits.

18:11.344 --> 18:13.945
Get off my friend!

18:13.947 --> 18:16.213
All right guys, time out,
come on. Come on, look.

18:16.215 --> 18:18.115
I know this may sound
crazy, but doesn't it seem

18:18.117 --> 18:20.117
like there's something
wrong with this world?

18:20.119 --> 18:22.753
Yeah. Rory sold out the boss.

18:22.755 --> 18:24.622
To throw in with you losers.

18:24.624 --> 18:26.857
Losers? I'll have you
know in my reality,

18:26.859 --> 18:29.511
you and I had sex, and we
both liked it very much.

18:29.514 --> 18:30.660
Nate, not helping.

18:30.663 --> 18:31.793
Amaya, look at me.

18:31.796 --> 18:34.780
Tell me you don't recognize me,
like, deep in your subconscious.

18:37.537 --> 18:39.570
Come... look, this isn't
how it's supposed to be.

18:39.572 --> 18:41.973
Okay, you're supposed
to be heroes like us.

18:41.975 --> 18:44.875
Okay. Allow me...

18:44.877 --> 18:48.279
to demonstrate my superpowers. Okay?

18:52.748 --> 18:53.947
Knock it off, you idiot.

18:53.950 --> 18:55.842
The Spear took away your powers.

18:55.845 --> 18:56.952
But it's true.

18:56.958 --> 18:58.210
Nate used to be able to steel up,

18:58.212 --> 19:01.694
and I had a robotic exoskeleton
that allowed me to shrink.

19:01.696 --> 19:04.196
Oh...

19:04.198 --> 19:06.599
These guys are heroes.

19:06.601 --> 19:09.168
That is so great.

19:10.504 --> 19:11.971
We kill heroes.

19:11.973 --> 19:13.339
Aw.

19:36.564 --> 19:39.665
One more person hits
me, I'm gonna punch back.

19:39.667 --> 19:40.833
What the hell happened to me?

19:40.835 --> 19:42.101
It appears that after the Legion

19:42.103 --> 19:43.903
got the Spear and changed reality,

19:43.905 --> 19:46.205
they kept us around as their pets.

19:46.207 --> 19:48.007
Yeah, except for you.

19:48.009 --> 19:50.309
You helped the Legion steal the Spear!

19:50.311 --> 19:53.112
Speaking of, the Legion's
probably on their way here

19:53.114 --> 19:55.247
to kill us. We need to get out of here.

19:55.249 --> 19:58.450
Yeah. Gotta find someplace to hide.

20:01.489 --> 20:03.455
Your mom's basement?

20:03.457 --> 20:05.190
Really?

20:05.192 --> 20:08.360
I pay rent, so legally
it's my basement, kinda.

20:08.362 --> 20:10.529
Mommy makes great sandwiches.

20:10.531 --> 20:12.231
The best. It's the perfect amount

20:12.233 --> 20:15.067
of mayo/meat/bread ratio
that really gives it...

20:15.069 --> 20:17.770
Focus! We need to figure out

20:17.772 --> 20:19.672
how we can rescue the rest of the team,

20:19.674 --> 20:21.540
and get the Spear back so we can undo

20:21.542 --> 20:23.008
everything the Legion has done.

20:23.010 --> 20:24.109
Except now they know we're trying

20:24.111 --> 20:25.878
to get the band back together.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.213
Except they don't know
that you've gotten to me,

20:28.215 --> 20:30.249
- which means...
- You can sneak into the Legion

20:30.251 --> 20:32.484
and pretend to be
Darhk's favorite chick.

20:32.486 --> 20:34.853
It's our best shot
at getting Amaya back.

20:34.855 --> 20:37.189
All right. What about
the rest of the team?

20:37.191 --> 20:40.025
Well, the Professor and Jax are working

20:40.027 --> 20:43.329
on some secret project for Thawne.

20:43.331 --> 20:44.930
I don't know where the Englishman is.

20:44.932 --> 20:47.066
Neither do it.

20:47.068 --> 20:49.635
Mmm. I can only imagine
how those psychopaths

20:49.637 --> 20:51.804
are torturing Rip.

20:54.229 --> 20:55.708
Gideon! I've discovered

20:55.710 --> 20:57.977
the missing ingredient for my recipe.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.815
Rum.

21:05.853 --> 21:07.586
And speaking of which,
I'm gonna need you

21:07.588 --> 21:10.125
to fabricate me another bottle of it.

21:10.128 --> 21:11.924
Ooh, and some nachos.

21:11.926 --> 21:13.625
I will do nothing of the sort.

21:13.627 --> 21:15.327
What?

21:15.329 --> 21:18.130
You will do as I tell you,
Gideon, I'm your captain!

21:18.132 --> 21:20.733
Then it's time for you
to start acting like one.

21:20.735 --> 21:24.703
Now, sit up straight and show
your backbone, Captain Hunter.

21:24.705 --> 21:27.873
Gideon, for the thousandth time,

21:27.875 --> 21:30.476
I've got no way of getting
the reserve power back online,

21:30.478 --> 21:31.944
and I've got no way of...

21:31.946 --> 21:34.947
Of sending out any signal of any sort,

21:34.949 --> 21:37.883
which means...

21:37.885 --> 21:43.522
Which means that I am destined
to live out the rest of my days

21:43.524 --> 21:47.326
right... here...

21:47.328 --> 21:48.927
with you.

21:48.929 --> 21:51.363
While you were honing
your confectionary skills,

21:51.365 --> 21:53.132
I've been working on new algorithms

21:53.134 --> 21:55.701
to redirect power from the
idle quadrants of the ship.

21:55.703 --> 21:57.803
You need to focus on
boosting your distress signal

21:57.805 --> 21:59.972
once power is fully back online.

21:59.974 --> 22:01.940
Now, chin up, Captain.

22:05.913 --> 22:08.647
I don't know if I can do this, Gideon.

22:08.649 --> 22:10.276
I believe in you.

22:10.279 --> 22:12.384
Now, let's get to work.

22:14.488 --> 22:16.288
First...

22:16.290 --> 22:18.123
I'm going to vomit.

22:18.125 --> 22:22.327
And second...

22:22.329 --> 22:24.530
let's do this.

22:27.468 --> 22:29.468
When your minions bring Mick back,

22:29.470 --> 22:31.937
I want to arrange a meeting with Thawne.

22:31.939 --> 22:33.872
When I say "arrange
a meeting," I mean...

22:33.874 --> 22:35.707
One between Thawne and his maker?

22:35.709 --> 22:39.011
Cute. A little
mustache-twirly for my taste.

22:39.013 --> 22:40.179
You're really gonna have to

22:40.181 --> 22:42.181
step up your tactics, Leonard.

22:42.183 --> 22:43.682
Yeah, you didn't think that Thawne was

22:43.684 --> 22:45.284
actually gonna fall for
that fake meeting trick?

22:45.286 --> 22:46.785
This is not "The Godfather."

22:46.787 --> 22:48.420
Although we do agree
with your sentiment.

22:48.422 --> 22:49.888
Eobard has to go.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.657
So glad you both approve.

22:51.659 --> 22:54.126
Which brings us back to
our original conundrum.

22:54.128 --> 22:56.328
How to kill a speedster.

22:56.330 --> 22:59.431
We found your partner,

22:59.433 --> 23:01.100
and he's got himself some friends.

23:01.102 --> 23:04.203
And where, pray tell, is
your partner, Miss Lance?

23:04.205 --> 23:06.180
We got separated in the fight.

23:06.183 --> 23:07.782
I haven't heard from her since,

23:07.785 --> 23:11.076
so I'm guessing she's dead by now.

23:11.078 --> 23:12.611
Ah, that's the thing about Sara Lance,

23:12.613 --> 23:14.513
she never stays dead for very long.

23:14.515 --> 23:16.615
Sorry, we underestimated them.

23:16.617 --> 23:18.750
Won't happen again. We'll fix this.

23:18.752 --> 23:20.385
- Let's go.
- Oh...

23:20.387 --> 23:23.555
not so fast.

23:24.374 --> 23:25.406
Yes?

23:27.895 --> 23:32.097
I have a question for you.

23:32.098 --> 23:35.266
Which one is your favorite trophy?

23:35.269 --> 23:38.537
That's like asking a girl to
pick just one pair of shoes.

23:38.539 --> 23:43.275
Oh, please, everyone
has their favorite kill.

23:43.277 --> 23:45.277
You want to hear mine?

23:45.279 --> 23:49.982
Her name was Black Canary.

23:49.984 --> 23:53.852
I will never forget her. Hmm.

23:53.854 --> 23:57.823
It was so... delicious,

23:57.825 --> 23:59.725
killing her.

23:59.727 --> 24:01.493
They told me that I'd done it before,

24:01.495 --> 24:03.996
but I can't imagine it ever getting old.

24:07.468 --> 24:09.434
The very first thing
I did in this reality

24:09.436 --> 24:11.103
was acquire my magic.

24:14.808 --> 24:17.576
I'm gonna miss you, Ms. Lance.

24:17.578 --> 24:19.945
Having you around to
attend to my every whim

24:19.947 --> 24:21.513
was too enticing to pass up.

24:21.515 --> 24:24.316
Plus, it's so hard to
find good help these days.

24:24.318 --> 24:27.786
Really? Now's the time
for a bad guy monologue?

24:27.788 --> 24:30.155
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

24:30.157 --> 24:32.824
No better time than the present.

24:32.826 --> 24:36.261
Amaya, the honor is yours.

24:40.534 --> 24:42.201
Good-bye.

24:46.173 --> 24:47.172
What the hell?

24:47.174 --> 24:49.341
Shoot now. Explain later.

24:55.983 --> 24:58.383
Damien, what did I tell you?

24:58.385 --> 24:59.918
For what it's worth,

24:59.920 --> 25:02.354
I thought it was a very
good bad guy monologue.

25:11.036 --> 25:12.903
Everything's on schedule, Mr. Thawne.

25:12.905 --> 25:15.072
You have nothing to worry about.

25:15.074 --> 25:16.707
Hey.

25:16.709 --> 25:19.076
What do you want?

25:21.213 --> 25:23.213
There's just one thing
I don't understand.

25:23.215 --> 25:26.049
If Thawne made this world to punish us,

25:26.051 --> 25:28.886
how are your mom's
sandwiches so good, bro?

25:28.888 --> 25:30.687
Her condiment game's on point, right?

25:30.689 --> 25:32.022
- Mmm.
- She even had

25:32.024 --> 25:33.457
gluten-free bread for me.

25:33.459 --> 25:35.459
Look, let's just get back to the ship.

25:35.461 --> 25:36.894
We don't know where the ship is,

25:36.896 --> 25:38.662
or Rip, which means our next move

25:38.664 --> 25:40.397
should be to rescue the Professor.

25:40.399 --> 25:42.900
Speaking of which, what did
Thone have you to working on?

25:42.902 --> 25:44.501
Grey did most of the work, and...

25:44.503 --> 25:46.603
I just made his life hell.

25:46.605 --> 25:48.338
But from what I could tell,

25:48.340 --> 25:50.174
he was building some sort of reactor.

25:50.176 --> 25:51.809
He said it would burn
a thousand times hotter

25:51.811 --> 25:53.310
than the sun once it's operational.

25:53.312 --> 25:54.878
I like the sound of that.

25:54.880 --> 25:58.148
Could be a power generator,
a particle accelerator.

25:58.150 --> 26:00.751
What if Thawne is trying
to destroy the Spear?

26:00.753 --> 26:02.554
Uh-uh, impossible. You
need the blood of Christ

26:02.556 --> 26:05.260
to destroy it. That's why Rip
broke it up into so many pieces.

26:05.263 --> 26:08.030
Unless he figured out there's
another way, by incinerating it.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.134
But why would Thawne
want to destroy the Spear?

26:11.497 --> 26:13.297
Oh, no.

26:13.299 --> 26:15.432
If he destroys the Spear,

26:15.434 --> 26:19.536
that means this
reality cannot be rewritten.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.275
Okay, we better get that Spear
before he can make that happen.

26:25.277 --> 26:26.710
But even if we find it,

26:26.712 --> 26:29.546
we don't know how to access its powers.

26:29.548 --> 26:32.216
Rory does. You were there,
right, when they used the Spear?

26:32.218 --> 26:34.218
Mm-hmm. They read out of some book

26:34.220 --> 26:35.953
called the, uh, "Calibrick"...

26:35.955 --> 26:37.120
"Cal"... "Caliber"...

26:37.122 --> 26:40.123
"Kalablow"... "Kalabalos"...

26:40.125 --> 26:41.792
Uh, something like that.

26:41.794 --> 26:43.494
Do you remember what language it was in?

26:43.496 --> 26:45.262
Aramaic.

26:45.264 --> 26:47.831
Dude, how do you even know
what Aramaic sounds like?

26:47.833 --> 26:50.801
"Passion of the Christ". Good movie.

26:50.803 --> 26:53.140
Mick, would you be able to
recognize the incantation?

26:53.143 --> 26:54.171
Yeah.

26:58.944 --> 27:01.578
Hey. If they figure out this incantation

27:01.580 --> 27:03.847
and we get our hands on the Spear,

27:03.849 --> 27:05.349
I want you to use it.

27:05.351 --> 27:07.351
I should have listened to
you back in World War I.

27:07.353 --> 27:09.486
If we had used the Spear
when we had the chance...

27:09.488 --> 27:10.521
I might have been tempted to use it

27:10.523 --> 27:13.023
to change my own future.

27:13.025 --> 27:16.627
Now... we've got nothing to lose.

27:16.629 --> 27:20.531
Oh, Marty, Marty, Marty.

27:20.533 --> 27:22.933
I know you've been working
so hard on this project,

27:22.935 --> 27:24.968
and I wanted to come
by and say thank you,

27:24.970 --> 27:28.839
but if it doesn't come online
in the next few minutes,

27:28.841 --> 27:30.327
I'll have to kill you.

27:30.330 --> 27:32.609
One... one moment, Mr. Thawne, I...

27:32.611 --> 27:34.511
I just need one more moment.

27:42.755 --> 27:44.488
There. There.

27:44.490 --> 27:46.957
As you can see, the machine
appears to be fully functional,

27:46.959 --> 27:48.458
though it may take some time

27:48.460 --> 27:51.161
for the core to reach peak temperature.

27:51.163 --> 27:53.697
Well, then you'll stay until it does.

27:53.699 --> 27:57.100
I-I was hoping to
see my family tonight.

27:57.102 --> 28:00.270
Oh, no. No, no, no, you can't
leave in your moment of glory.

28:00.272 --> 28:01.705
You keep monitoring the core

28:01.707 --> 28:04.508
and make sure the
reaction remains stable.

28:06.845 --> 28:09.112
Think we got something.

28:09.114 --> 28:11.882
We pieced together a passage
from the "Kalabros."

28:11.884 --> 28:13.450
AKA the word of God.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.186
All right, Jax, it's on you

28:16.188 --> 28:18.293
to restore Stein's mind
before we get to the lab.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.890
We gotta destroy the reactor

28:19.892 --> 28:21.758
before Thawne can destroy the Spear.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.260
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Now, remember,

28:23.262 --> 28:25.729
you guys are going in
there without your powers.

28:25.731 --> 28:27.798
Don't worry. I know that
place like the back of my hand.

28:27.800 --> 28:28.999
What about Mick?

28:29.001 --> 28:31.268
Mick's staying here.

28:31.270 --> 28:33.203
We can't trust him.

28:33.205 --> 28:35.105
Not after what you've done.

28:35.107 --> 28:37.741
After what I've done?
If it wasn't for me,

28:37.743 --> 28:40.310
you'd all be walking around like sheep.

28:40.312 --> 28:42.713
If it wasn't for you,
we never would have been

28:42.715 --> 28:46.483
turned into sheep in the first place.

28:46.485 --> 28:47.951
We trusted you, Mick.

28:47.953 --> 28:51.254
We can't afford to
make that mistake again.

28:51.256 --> 28:53.590
Let's go.

29:11.910 --> 29:14.411
League of losers cut you loose?

29:14.413 --> 29:17.447
Nobody cuts me loose.

29:17.449 --> 29:19.816
I'm done with those people.

29:19.818 --> 29:22.819
What do you say we burn
this city to the ground?

29:25.391 --> 29:28.659
Knowing Sara, she's
rallied the team by now.

29:28.661 --> 29:30.894
Those idiots aren't
whom I'm worried about.

29:30.896 --> 29:36.033
Relax, boys. Prodigal son has returned.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.834
And he's got some news for us.

29:37.836 --> 29:40.003
Isn't that right, Mick?

29:41.640 --> 29:46.443
Our old friend Eobard has built
a device to destroy the Spear.

29:46.445 --> 29:48.412
No wonder Eobard
doesn't want us using it

29:48.414 --> 29:50.614
before he locks in his
own version of reality.

29:50.616 --> 29:52.716
Which I assume means erasing all of us.

29:52.718 --> 29:54.284
And your pals.

29:54.286 --> 29:56.829
My pals.

29:56.832 --> 29:59.899
They want to steal the
Spear before the deed's done.

29:59.901 --> 30:02.569
I think you can see what
I'm getting at, gentlemen.

30:02.571 --> 30:04.437
The four of us are no
match for a speedster,

30:04.439 --> 30:06.306
so while Thawne is
fighting the Legends...

30:06.308 --> 30:08.875
We'll grab the Spear from
under both their noses.

30:08.877 --> 30:12.846
Exactly. The enemy of my enemy...

30:12.848 --> 30:15.448
Is our opportunity.

30:31.457 --> 30:33.690
The status of the machine, Doctor?

30:34.878 --> 30:36.994
Please tell Mr. Thawne I'm
working as fast as I can.

30:36.996 --> 30:39.396
I've powered up the
reactor. I just need to make

30:39.398 --> 30:40.964
a few adjustments to the core.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.699
Did you already turn it on?

30:42.701 --> 30:46.236
I-I had specific instructions
from Mr. Thawne to do so.

30:46.238 --> 30:48.171
Grey, we need to talk.

30:48.173 --> 30:49.573
Grey?

30:51.076 --> 30:53.277
Please, don't...

30:53.279 --> 30:55.279
Don't kill me, I've done
everything Mr. Thawne wanted.

30:55.281 --> 30:57.581
I'm not gonna kill you. I'm
just gonna make you better.

31:00.351 --> 31:01.984
Grey, what have you done?

31:01.987 --> 31:03.486
If Mr. Thawne wants to kill me,

31:03.489 --> 31:04.755
he'll have to do it himself.

31:07.493 --> 31:10.794
Guys, we got a problem.
You gotta get here ASAP.

31:10.796 --> 31:12.963
We're at the building.
Just keep him there.

31:12.965 --> 31:15.399
Ray, find us the quickest
way into the lab, now.

31:15.401 --> 31:17.834
Look, you gotta believe me, okay?

31:17.836 --> 31:19.970
This is not the way it's supposed to be.

31:19.972 --> 31:22.673
Is this some sort of test of my loyalty?

31:22.675 --> 31:23.874
Does Mr. Thawne even care?

31:23.876 --> 31:25.409
Look, this isn't about Thawne.

31:25.411 --> 31:26.910
It's about you and me.

31:26.912 --> 31:29.713
I assure you, my... my
dedication to Mr. Thawne

31:29.715 --> 31:31.214
has never been stronger.

31:34.086 --> 31:36.320
Did you just press the silent alarm?

31:36.322 --> 31:38.955
What? No, it's...

31:38.957 --> 31:42.392
It's a secondary radiation
sensor for the nuclear core.

31:42.394 --> 31:46.530
Grey, you are a crappy
liar in any reality.

31:46.532 --> 31:48.732
Martin.

31:49.735 --> 31:51.201
I can't talk any sense into him,

31:51.203 --> 31:52.602
and he just triggered an alarm.

31:52.604 --> 31:54.738
Which means Thawne'll be here soon.

31:57.209 --> 31:59.076
Or now.

31:59.078 --> 32:04.314
Well, looks like you losers
managed to remember who you are.

32:06.051 --> 32:07.617
I should've wiped you from existence

32:07.619 --> 32:09.052
when I had the chance.

32:09.054 --> 32:13.890
Do you have any idea
how infuriating it is

32:13.892 --> 32:17.127
to know that Merlyn was right?

32:17.129 --> 32:21.264
Lucky for you, I still believe
in some fates worse than death.

32:21.266 --> 32:22.566
Like me destroying the Spear

32:22.568 --> 32:25.469
and cementing this reality for all time.

32:30.943 --> 32:32.809
Martin.

32:32.811 --> 32:35.312
The reactor is fully operational, sir.

32:35.314 --> 32:36.747
This...

32:36.749 --> 32:39.383
is the only reality

32:39.385 --> 32:40.984
any of you

32:40.986 --> 32:42.452
will ever know.

32:42.454 --> 32:44.688
We'll never give up trying to stop you.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.990
Well...

32:46.992 --> 32:48.892
if it weren't for your futile efforts,

32:48.894 --> 32:50.594
this wouldn't be half so sweet.

32:52.698 --> 32:56.166
Not so fast, speedy. You
have something we want.

32:56.168 --> 32:59.369
You need a lesson in how
to share your toys, Eobard.

32:59.371 --> 33:01.838
Yeah, time for us to get
a turn with the Spear.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.841
And do what with it?

33:04.843 --> 33:08.779
Don't you understand? I'm trying
to protect you from yourselves.

33:08.781 --> 33:10.213
With the Spear destroyed...

33:10.215 --> 33:11.648
Bored now.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.420
Get the Spear!

33:33.472 --> 33:35.439
- Ah!
- Let go of the Spear,

33:35.441 --> 33:38.008
and I won't use it to
turn you into a jockstrap.

33:46.685 --> 33:48.819
Yeah!

33:50.756 --> 33:52.422
Uh, perhaps not.

33:54.793 --> 33:55.992
Ahh.

33:59.731 --> 34:01.164
Give it up!

34:06.338 --> 34:07.871
Oh, Sara.

34:07.873 --> 34:10.172
Why do we always find
ourselves in this situation?

34:10.175 --> 34:11.475
'Cause you keep finding yourself

34:11.476 --> 34:12.966
on the wrong side of history.

34:41.306 --> 34:42.873
Aah!

34:45.710 --> 34:48.210
Nice work, Mick.

34:48.213 --> 34:50.880
Now hand it over.

34:50.882 --> 34:53.516
Mick, no. You already
gave it to him once.

34:53.518 --> 34:54.618
You know what happened.

34:54.620 --> 34:55.550
That was Thawne.

34:55.553 --> 34:57.187
This time will be different, big boy.

34:57.189 --> 34:58.622
Don't do this, Mick.

35:00.459 --> 35:03.827
Mick, I don't care
what anyone else thinks.

35:03.829 --> 35:05.662
I still believe in you.

35:07.699 --> 35:10.333
Enough! Mick...

35:12.571 --> 35:14.070
Hand it over.

35:16.837 --> 35:18.675
Like a good boy.

35:18.677 --> 35:21.811
You mean a good dog.

35:21.813 --> 35:24.247
That's all I am to you.

35:24.249 --> 35:26.149
An attack dog.

35:26.151 --> 35:28.385
Now, that's not true.

35:28.387 --> 35:31.488
Sure, we both know you're not
the sharpest tool in the shed,

35:31.490 --> 35:36.259
but that's why we're partners, remember?

35:37.308 --> 35:38.986
You're right.

35:41.934 --> 35:43.600
I'm not a genius.

35:48.206 --> 35:52.442
But I'm not one's dog,
Leonard. Not anymore.

35:55.981 --> 35:57.380
Well.

35:58.684 --> 36:03.386
I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

36:06.291 --> 36:07.891
Undo this mess.

36:38.957 --> 36:43.927
I am sorry about your friend, Mick.

36:43.929 --> 36:46.696
I know you loved her to pieces.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.366
No!

37:13.625 --> 37:16.359
Well, if you want
something done right...

37:16.361 --> 37:17.927
Well done, Leonard.

37:19.264 --> 37:20.730
You bastard.

37:20.732 --> 37:22.732
I'll kill you all.

37:23.631 --> 37:25.698
Actually, I believe that's my line.

37:27.305 --> 37:30.840
Now, where were we before
I was so rudely interrupted?

37:59.237 --> 38:01.171
Well...

38:01.173 --> 38:02.772
I guess we're done here.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.639
You know the really swell thing

38:26.641 --> 38:28.575
about the Spear being destroyed?

38:30.412 --> 38:32.579
Now you can't stop us from killing you.

38:32.581 --> 38:36.015
Oh, please. Don't insult my intelligence.

38:36.017 --> 38:37.417
Even at your fastest,

38:37.419 --> 38:39.152
you're moving in slow motion to me.

38:39.154 --> 38:41.321
Except they're not alone.

38:41.323 --> 38:44.524
I say we go down fighting.

38:45.324 --> 38:48.728
You kill one of us, we kill all of you.

38:48.730 --> 38:51.297
For Amaya.

38:51.299 --> 38:53.099
Don't.

38:53.101 --> 38:56.236
Even if you survive my men,
you'll never survive me,

38:56.238 --> 39:00.240
not without powers or weapons.

39:00.243 --> 39:04.945
And the truth is, I don't want
to see any more of you dead.

39:04.946 --> 39:08.047
Not out of sentiment, of course.
No, no, quite the opposite.

39:08.049 --> 39:12.185
But because it is so...

39:12.187 --> 39:14.087
delicious,

39:14.089 --> 39:16.456
knowing that you'll be
forced to live your lives

39:16.458 --> 39:20.860
in a reality that I...
Well, that we created.

39:22.430 --> 39:23.930
You will walk this world knowing

39:23.932 --> 39:25.899
that something isn't quite right,

39:25.901 --> 39:30.003
that for all your trying
you only made things worse,

39:30.005 --> 39:32.438
and no one will ever believe
you when you tell them

39:32.440 --> 39:34.541
about all the sacrifices you made

39:34.543 --> 39:37.644
and how close you came to being Legends.

39:41.798 --> 39:44.117
Now, that sounds like a
fitting punishment to me.

39:44.119 --> 39:46.786
What do you think, Professor Stein?

39:46.788 --> 39:48.321
I don't care what you do to them,

39:48.323 --> 39:51.090
as long as I never have
to see Mr. Jackson again.

39:51.092 --> 39:53.693
Ah.

39:53.695 --> 39:57.030
Fair enough.

39:57.032 --> 39:58.565
You're free to go.

39:58.567 --> 40:00.166
You're just gonna let them walk?

40:00.168 --> 40:01.601
Be glad I'm letting you

40:01.603 --> 40:03.837
and your fellow traitors do the same.

40:03.839 --> 40:09.175
And the next time any of you get
what you think is a smart idea,

40:09.176 --> 40:12.211
remember this grace.

40:12.214 --> 40:13.847
And the fact I could kill any of you

40:13.849 --> 40:16.583
in the blink of an eye.

40:21.323 --> 40:24.090
My mom's not gonna be cool with that.

40:24.092 --> 40:26.960
Do I look like I give a damn?

40:28.330 --> 40:30.296
I can't believe that's it.

40:30.298 --> 40:32.599
I refuse to believe that this is it.

40:32.601 --> 40:34.033
Without the Spear, there's no way

40:34.035 --> 40:36.502
we can undo any of this.

40:36.504 --> 40:38.872
There is one way.

40:38.874 --> 40:40.640
Time travel.

40:40.642 --> 40:42.242
What do you mean?

40:42.244 --> 40:45.211
We go back in time to 1916,

40:45.213 --> 40:46.880
and we stop the Legion from ever getting

40:46.882 --> 40:48.548
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

40:48.550 --> 40:51.551
No, we are not supposed to change

40:51.553 --> 40:53.052
events we participated in.

40:53.054 --> 40:56.489
And if we do, we risk
time folding in on itself.

40:56.491 --> 41:01.027
Even if we weren't worried
about messing with time,

41:01.029 --> 41:03.897
we can't go anywhere. Or anywhen.

41:03.899 --> 41:05.932
We don't even know
where the Waverider is.

41:05.934 --> 41:07.800
If it even exists in this reality.

41:07.802 --> 41:09.202
Well, if it does, there's one person

41:09.204 --> 41:12.872
who knows where it is.

41:12.874 --> 41:15.508
We just have to find him.

41:15.510 --> 41:17.243
I've directed all available power

41:17.245 --> 41:19.379
to the main navigational
controls, Captain.

41:19.381 --> 41:20.980
Thank you, Gideon.

41:20.982 --> 41:23.716
Now, I've started the
communications protocol,

41:23.718 --> 41:27.987
and if I just splice
these two wires together...

41:29.858 --> 41:32.792
Your distress signal will be broadcast.

41:34.329 --> 41:36.329
Surely the rest of the team

41:36.331 --> 41:38.965
must be out there somewhere, listening.
