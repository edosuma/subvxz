00:19.220 --> 00:22.180
All right, I got 50 smackers
for each and every man...

00:22.310 --> 00:24.940
willing to work
an honest day at my compound.

00:25.060 --> 00:26.100
Who's up for it?

00:26.230 --> 00:27.900
I'm taking rocket engineers...

00:28.020 --> 00:29.520
radar-tracking operations managers...

00:29.650 --> 00:32.570
super fusion
fuel-rod insertion specialists...

00:32.689 --> 00:34.860
with venturilium-handling
experience...

00:34.990 --> 00:36.320
and I'm gonna need one or two guys...

00:36.450 --> 00:38.620
who can do
phased-plasma spectrum analysis.

00:38.740 --> 00:41.490
Any takers?

00:41.620 --> 00:43.830
Anybody?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.210
No?

01:25.160 --> 01:27.500
Geez.
They never learn.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.210
And they get lamer every week.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.630
Yeah, looks like Manosaurus.

01:31.750 --> 01:34.960
Better go check if he's got
any henchmen stuck further down.

01:35.090 --> 01:36.550
All right, all right...

01:36.670 --> 01:37.880
enough about
how great you're doing!

01:38.010 --> 01:39.680
It was a rhetorical question.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.100
What I'm really
calling about is just to, uh...

01:43.220 --> 01:44.350
give you a heads-up.

01:44.470 --> 01:48.560
I've got a meeting this morning
with a certain 4-star general...

01:48.690 --> 01:52.190
to discuss a certain
hot business deal with a certain me.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.150
You got a meeting with Manhowers, huh?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.030
- That's great, Rust.
- Yes, it is.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.610
Tell him I say hi, the choppers he ordered
will be ready a week ahead of schedule.

01:59.740 --> 02:00.910
So, anyway...

02:01.030 --> 02:04.200
next time you do a photo shoot
for one of the science rags...

02:04.330 --> 02:05.370
get ready to move over...

02:05.500 --> 02:07.620
because I'm lifting
my self-imposed media blackout.

02:08.789 --> 02:11.380
Hey, you saw the
super-scientific American piece, did you?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.750
That must have been
one of the gals in my P.R. Department.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.250
Hup. Hang on a sec.

02:15.380 --> 02:17.380
You have a Puerto Rican department?

02:17.510 --> 02:18.420
Hello? What? Rusty?

02:18.550 --> 02:19.630
Still here.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.680
- New phones. Hello?
- Hello, Dr. Venture?

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
Still me.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.470
Hadji.
Give me good news, buddy.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.890
I wish that I could,
Dr. Venture, but this is not so!

02:27.020 --> 02:28.600
Hello.
I can hear you.

02:28.730 --> 02:30.440
We have had
some problems on the line.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.860
Come on, Raj,
are you snowballing me?

02:32.980 --> 02:35.570
You promised you'd put on
extra shifts to make the street date.

02:35.690 --> 02:36.860
A thousand pardons, Dr. Venture!

02:36.990 --> 02:38.110
Get off! Get off!

02:38.240 --> 02:40.400
We are trying to work for you!

02:40.530 --> 02:44.530
But I I have Jonny staying with me,
and he is in a bad, bad way!

02:47.450 --> 02:48.620
Car!

02:48.750 --> 02:49.790
He's early.

02:49.910 --> 02:50.960
Boys, inside.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.580
Doc! Doc! Code green!

02:53.710 --> 02:55.500
The eagle has landed!

02:55.630 --> 02:57.090
What am I to do?!

02:57.210 --> 02:59.720
My wife will leave me if I
bring him to the house again...

02:59.840 --> 03:01.550
but he is like my brother to me!

03:01.680 --> 03:03.260
Brother!
Hold on, Raj, I forgot.

03:03.390 --> 03:04.510
I got Rusty on the other line.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.970
Rusty?!
Has he asked you for money yet?

03:07.100 --> 03:09.220
Hold on, Hadji.

03:09.350 --> 03:10.730
Rust, you still there?

03:12.100 --> 03:13.400
Crap, did he hear us?!

03:15.190 --> 03:16.940
Places, everyone. Places!

03:17.940 --> 03:20.070
Turn on the juice!

03:24.780 --> 03:26.450
Uh, Dr. Venture, please.

03:26.580 --> 03:27.620
I got an appointment.

03:27.740 --> 03:28.950
And you are?

03:29.080 --> 03:31.330
General H.I. Manhowers,
United States Armed Forces.

03:31.460 --> 03:32.750
OK, now.

03:33.750 --> 03:37.960
Yes, yes, of course.
$1 0 million will be fine.

03:38.090 --> 03:41.970
And anytime
the European Space Agency needs more...

03:42.090 --> 03:43.090
you know where to find us.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.430
Grazie, signore Ventura.

03:45.550 --> 03:46.470
Ciao.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.890
Guten Tag.

03:48.010 --> 03:51.480
Oh, hello, you must be
General Manhowers?

03:51.600 --> 03:53.100
Oh.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.060
Well, shall I
give you the grand tour?

03:57.190 --> 03:58.110
But wait.

03:58.230 --> 04:01.610
Why walk
when you can ride in style?

04:03.110 --> 04:04.320
Moving walkway.

04:04.450 --> 04:05.860
Hmm.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.240
Hold all my calls!

04:07.370 --> 04:08.450
Venture Industries?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.950
Dean, they can't hear you.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.500
You don't have to pretend that hard.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.910
They can't?

04:14.040 --> 04:14.960
Oh, OK.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.209
I'm on.

04:16.329 --> 04:19.170
- Morning, dad.
- Hello, son!

04:19.300 --> 04:21.510
Say, is that where my top-secret...

04:21.630 --> 04:23.340
experimental hover boots have gotten to?

04:23.470 --> 04:24.510
Sorry, pop.

04:24.630 --> 04:25.680
I couldn't resist.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.180
They've got 1 ,001 uses
around the home, at work...

04:29.310 --> 04:30.510
or in combat situations.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.480
Boys will be boys.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.650
- Hmm.
- Morning, Dr. Venture.

04:36.770 --> 04:39.110
"Hey, pop!"

04:39.230 --> 04:40.360
"Hey, pop."

04:41.530 --> 04:42.940
All right, what's next?

04:43.070 --> 04:44.820
Ah, "Future man."

04:44.950 --> 04:46.780
Costume's on the rack,
wig's over here...

04:46.910 --> 04:48.200
makeup's in the bottom tray.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.830
Line?
Line!

04:49.950 --> 04:53.540
"Dr. Venture, quickly, the future is in peril."

04:53.660 --> 04:54.830
"She swoons.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.880
"Dr. Venture catches her,
and they kiss passionately."

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Ugh. Who writes this crap?

05:04.050 --> 05:06.430
Jeepers creepers!
What do you got there?

05:06.550 --> 05:08.090
Oh, you like that?

05:08.220 --> 05:09.550
It's just a little stealth bomber...

05:09.680 --> 05:12.010
I've been noodling around
with in my spare time.

05:12.140 --> 05:13.770
Now you're talking.

05:13.890 --> 05:16.180
What say we get
down there for a little looky-loo?

05:16.310 --> 05:19.100
Oh, uh, well,
it's not, uh, finished yet.

05:19.230 --> 05:20.270
Maybe next visit.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.110
Though I got to
wonder why you'd put a big logo...

05:24.240 --> 05:25.570
on a stealth plane.

05:25.700 --> 05:29.160
Um, so we can find it, of course.

05:30.370 --> 05:33.290
And now for the coup de grace--

05:33.410 --> 05:37.660
the most highly restricted area
of the Venture compound--

05:37.790 --> 05:41.250
our Rocket Research
Observation Command Center...

05:41.380 --> 05:44.000
or Rrocc!

05:45.340 --> 05:49.630
Uh, just-- just a sec.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.890
Uh, uh...

05:51.010 --> 05:52.640
uh, I...

05:55.180 --> 05:56.770
Looks like it's seen better--

05:56.890 --> 05:58.350
say, where is everyone?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.350
Yeah, I gave the staff the day off.

06:02.230 --> 06:03.860
The week.
Jewish holidays.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.780
What the...

06:05.900 --> 06:07.490
Not now,
not now, not now.

06:07.610 --> 06:08.700
Venture!

06:08.820 --> 06:11.110
Face me, Dr. Venture!

06:11.240 --> 06:14.490
Face me... if you dare!

06:14.620 --> 06:16.500
Uh, I'll take care of this.

06:16.620 --> 06:17.870
Hey. Hey!

06:18.000 --> 06:21.380
Uh, this kind of thing
happen a lot 'round here?

06:21.500 --> 06:23.420
Um, my archenemy quit...

06:23.540 --> 06:25.880
so lately I've got every
Tom, Dick, and Skeletor...

06:26.010 --> 06:28.090
out to make a name for himself
knocking on my door.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.180
Who's that other fella talking to him?

06:30.300 --> 06:33.350
Oh, he's another valued customer of mine.

06:33.470 --> 06:34.640
Aah! Aah!

06:34.760 --> 06:35.850
Uh, diplomat.

06:35.970 --> 06:38.600
Hell of a lot of
brand loyalty from the big Indian.

06:38.730 --> 06:41.140
- Stop it! Please!
- Come here, you little...

06:41.270 --> 06:42.690
- Aah! Aah!
- Come here!

06:42.810 --> 06:43.860
Hyah! Hyah!

06:48.400 --> 06:49.650
Aah!

06:50.660 --> 06:52.990
Well, since everything
seems to be under control out here...

06:53.120 --> 06:56.030
what say we head
back inside and talk business?

06:56.160 --> 06:58.700
Nah, I think I've seen enough.

06:58.830 --> 06:59.960
Wait. Wait!

07:00.080 --> 07:01.080
That's not all I've got.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.000
Look!
Zero-gravity pen!

07:03.130 --> 07:04.750
It writes in space.

07:04.880 --> 07:05.840
You keep it, son.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.550
Truth is, you got
a lot of impressive stuff here...

07:08.670 --> 07:10.170
- ...no two ways about it.
- Aah! Aah!

07:10.300 --> 07:12.180
A lot of it's the same impressive stuff...

07:12.300 --> 07:14.470
I saw back when
your dad was running the show...

07:14.600 --> 07:15.640
only it all still worked.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.180
Is this about your shoe?

07:17.310 --> 07:19.270
Because if you wait 20 minutes,
it'll come back around.

07:19.390 --> 07:21.690
Oh, I don't know how
gum got on the walkway.

07:21.810 --> 07:24.270
Yeah, yeah, thanks for
showing me around, Dr. Venture...

07:24.400 --> 07:26.270
and for the Fruitopia.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.480
Can't remember
the last time I had one of those.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.240
And speaking of shoes...

07:31.360 --> 07:34.610
you haven't seen these yet--
spy shoes!

07:34.740 --> 07:37.830
The soles flip around
so that the Russians...

07:37.950 --> 07:39.870
can't follow your footprints!

07:40.000 --> 07:42.830
I-I call them sneakies.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.710
Oh, stop it. It's over.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.090
We're not really gonna have to
sell the compound, are we, pa?

07:49.210 --> 07:50.420
I don't know, Dean.

07:50.550 --> 07:51.590
I don't know.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.720
Why don't you ask
Uncle J.J. for another loan?

07:53.840 --> 07:55.470
He's rolling in the dough.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.850
Perhaps I can be of assistance.

07:59.180 --> 08:01.180
I am Dr. Henry Killinger.

08:01.310 --> 08:03.560
And this is my résumé.

08:03.690 --> 08:07.360
"Freelance business consultant
and executive motivational coach."

08:07.480 --> 08:09.570
- I don't know if I can afford--
- I work pro bono.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.070
Great!
When can you start?

08:11.190 --> 08:13.320
I already have.

08:13.450 --> 08:14.360
Whoa!

08:14.490 --> 08:17.570
You cannot hope to reverse
your regrettable financial straits...

08:17.700 --> 08:20.290
without increasing
production und workflow.

08:20.410 --> 08:22.870
To do this,
you will need a highly skilled...

08:23.000 --> 08:25.080
full-time staff,
und here they are.

08:25.210 --> 08:27.080
Jesus!
How did the...

08:27.210 --> 08:30.000
Well, team building
is a specialty of mine.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.590
I can't--
they don't look Mexican!

08:32.720 --> 08:34.299
How am I supposed to
pay all these people?!

08:34.429 --> 08:35.929
You won't. The state will.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.510
These men are part of
a work furlough program.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.350
I call them the Venchmen.

08:41.470 --> 08:44.600
Do you get it? Venture?
Vench-men?

08:44.730 --> 08:46.060
No, no, I get it.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.190
I'm just imagining what
the super-science workers union...

08:48.310 --> 08:50.610
is gonna say when
they get a load of the scabs.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.070
They've been on strike for,
like, two years.

08:53.190 --> 08:54.190
Da-a-d!

08:54.320 --> 08:57.450
The manufacturing wing--
it's on fire!

08:57.570 --> 08:59.740
Aw, looks like
we're under attack again.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.410
Everybody in the panic room.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.490
I'll take care of this.

09:02.620 --> 09:03.620
Relax, my friend.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.290
There will be no more attacks.

09:05.410 --> 09:08.960
What you see is not fire
but industry breathing...

09:09.090 --> 09:11.880
new life into the corpse
of the Venture compound.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.550
I've never seen it do that before.

09:13.670 --> 09:14.710
Me neither.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.970
Wow!
You're some kind of magic man!

09:17.090 --> 09:18.800
No, you are the magic man.

09:18.930 --> 09:19.890
Wow!

09:20.010 --> 09:22.810
I suggest you put that
into a high-yield mutual fund.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.520
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have much work to do.

09:29.310 --> 09:30.270
Gentlemen.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.610
Esteemed representatives
of the machine workers...

09:32.730 --> 09:35.740
nuclear engineering
and custodial super-science unions...

09:35.860 --> 09:37.860
I have read your list of grievances...

09:37.990 --> 09:40.660
and am prepared to make you
a very generous offer...

09:40.780 --> 09:42.530
on behalf of Venture Industries.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.080
Who the hell are you?!

09:44.200 --> 09:46.580
Killinger--
Dr. Henry Killinger.

09:46.710 --> 09:50.380
And this is my magic murder bag.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.380
Well, gentlemen,
we have a deal on the table.

09:55.510 --> 09:58.090
What do you say? Any takers?

09:58.220 --> 10:00.180
"Notice of hostile takeover"?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.510
Who? Venture?

10:01.640 --> 10:02.550
What a dick!

10:02.680 --> 10:04.850
Wait, we're not even
a publicly traded company.

10:04.970 --> 10:07.020
Oh, uh, FYI--
I issued some shares back...

10:07.140 --> 10:08.600
when we needed cash
for the Nintendo Wii.

10:08.730 --> 10:09.850
What?!

10:09.980 --> 10:11.270
We're supposed to be partners!

10:11.400 --> 10:13.190
Why didn't--
is this supposed to be me?

10:13.320 --> 10:14.570
As a griffin, yeah.

10:14.690 --> 10:16.860
Well, we're partners, ain't we?

10:16.990 --> 10:18.820
- Why are you a Minotaur?
- Centaur.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.990
Eviction?!
But I'm not in arrears!

10:22.120 --> 10:24.330
The company is going back
into arachnid research.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.910
Your quarters have been rezoned.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.000
What?

10:27.120 --> 10:28.870
Why, Mr. Venture will hear of this!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.370
Dr. Venture has given me
power of attorney...

10:31.500 --> 10:32.540
in all business matters.

10:32.670 --> 10:33.750
Wait.

10:33.880 --> 10:39.170
There's something strange
about you, doughy mystery man.

10:39.300 --> 10:45.510
I sense-- hmm--
the presence of-- hmm...

10:45.640 --> 10:47.020
Hmm...

10:47.140 --> 10:49.850
Your powers
are useless on me, you silly Billy.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.980
Aah!

10:52.980 --> 10:55.770
You have until
noon tomorrow to vacate the premises.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.110
Good day.

10:57.530 --> 11:01.030
Yeah, I have just the thing
to snap him out of it back at my place.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.240
I didn't know who else to call.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.700
Thank you so much for doing this, Al.

11:03.820 --> 11:05.080
Before you thank me...

11:05.200 --> 11:07.370
be warned--
I only have one bed.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.460
It's a horsehair mattress,
so if you guys aren't allergic...

11:10.580 --> 11:12.420
- ...and you don't mind sharing...
- Ugh.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.130
I know, I know, sharing a bed...

11:14.250 --> 11:16.920
with this guy's like
sleeping with a 1 0-speed bike.

11:17.050 --> 11:18.050
You two?

11:18.170 --> 11:19.380
It's not what you think.

11:19.510 --> 11:21.970
We did a lot of road gigs in the old days.

11:22.090 --> 11:23.130
Yo, beefcake!

11:23.260 --> 11:25.510
Can we get a hand truck
over here, or what?

11:26.180 --> 11:27.140
You want me to what?!

11:27.260 --> 11:29.390
Now that we have repaired
your business structure...

11:29.520 --> 11:32.600
we must get to work
on repairing your soul.

11:32.730 --> 11:33.940
I'm not following you.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.770
You will never be able to
reach your full potential until...

11:36.900 --> 11:39.230
you first confront
your deep-seated fear of success.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.610
Now get into the bag.

11:40.740 --> 11:42.070
What's in it?

11:42.200 --> 11:44.070
Only what you take with you.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.740
OK.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.200
I'm standing in a bag.

11:49.330 --> 11:50.830
Are you?

11:52.210 --> 11:54.870
This is--
this is my old kitchen.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.540
I remember this wallpaper.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.500
Hey!

11:59.630 --> 12:01.920
"Remember."
Remember what?

12:02.050 --> 12:04.760
What does this have to do
with my super-science business?

12:04.890 --> 12:05.800
Hello?!

12:05.930 --> 12:07.510
Hello, Rusty!

12:07.640 --> 12:09.560
You're up bright and early.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.270
I heard noises.

12:11.390 --> 12:15.900
Oh, um, daddy
had a little sleepover.

12:16.020 --> 12:18.570
Say, uh, what ya eating there?

12:18.690 --> 12:20.150
Alpha Dog!

12:21.360 --> 12:23.190
I like Apple Mummy better, though.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.530
Apple Mummy.

12:26.660 --> 12:30.370
Either way, the thing is
you've got to get a good breakfast...

12:30.490 --> 12:33.540
because breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.250
King Nutri-man's my favorite...

12:35.370 --> 12:37.080
but you don't get a prize!

12:37.210 --> 12:39.210
Aw, what are you
trying to do to me?!

12:41.880 --> 12:44.260
This is the moment
your feelings of inadequacy...

12:44.380 --> 12:47.510
first manifested themselves--
when your father...

12:47.640 --> 12:49.930
turned from role model
to tormentor/rival.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.140
What are you
going to do about it?!

12:57.730 --> 12:58.650
Pop?!

12:58.770 --> 13:00.190
Help me, pop!

13:00.320 --> 13:01.520
Hold tight, Rusty!

13:01.650 --> 13:03.650
I'll have you out of this in a jiff.

13:03.780 --> 13:05.780
No, do not call out
to your father to save you.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.530
He is the one who tied you up...

13:07.660 --> 13:09.570
und buried your dreams in this tomb.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.910
He commands
these creatures of the dark--

13:12.040 --> 13:16.250
fear, self-loathing,
stinkin' thinkin', und dillydallying.

13:16.370 --> 13:20.340
Free yourself
and destroy this temple of failure!

13:20.460 --> 13:22.670
Ugh!

13:22.800 --> 13:25.420
Aah!

13:25.550 --> 13:26.510
Rusty?

13:26.630 --> 13:28.640
What's all that racket?

13:28.760 --> 13:31.220
The goliath will not stop
crushing your soul...

13:31.350 --> 13:33.430
until you slay him once und forever.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.810
Kill him!

13:34.930 --> 13:37.190
Take your rightful place
on the Venture throne...

13:37.310 --> 13:40.230
und become
the golden boy/king godhead.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.650
Lights out, son.

13:41.770 --> 13:42.900
It's time for bed.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.190
Do it-- slay him now
and forever be free!

13:49.950 --> 13:52.580
The son has become the father...

13:52.700 --> 13:55.410
und the floodgates
of heaven have opened.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.660
Prosperity rains upon you.

13:57.790 --> 13:59.420
Mmm.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.880
Ah, but who is this tiny little man?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.380
Why is he stealing your birthright?

14:07.170 --> 14:11.050
Careful-- the vision was
so traumatizing to your psyche...

14:11.180 --> 14:12.180
you had a seizure.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.220
What?!
How did I get in here?!

14:14.350 --> 14:15.560
Why am I naked?

14:15.680 --> 14:17.390
Did you slip me a roof-o?

14:17.520 --> 14:19.600
You're naked
because you've been born again.

14:19.730 --> 14:23.060
Your old clothes,
your old life no longer fit you.

14:23.190 --> 14:26.070
But I have something that will.

14:26.190 --> 14:28.650
Und I'll be needing my wallet back also.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.240
Ah, Mr. Samson.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.070
Uh, yeah.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.950
Here, it's a little housewarming gift.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.660
Give it here, big man.

14:38.790 --> 14:39.910
Ah? Tch-tch-tch.

14:40.040 --> 14:40.960
Pop a squat.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.630
You're just in time to rescue us
from Mr. Goodtimes here.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.800
Er, to what do
we owe this unannounced...

14:46.920 --> 14:47.880
but welcome pleasure?

14:48.010 --> 14:50.130
I dunno, bored, I guess.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.720
Then you've vanquished
your demonic intruder?

14:52.850 --> 14:53.800
Excellent!

14:53.930 --> 14:56.140
I presume you've come
to invite us back to home?

14:56.270 --> 14:58.140
Uh, no, that new Killinger guy...

14:58.270 --> 15:00.390
got rid of all those costumed schmoes...

15:00.520 --> 15:03.190
who kept bugging us,
so there's just...

15:03.310 --> 15:06.150
not a whole hell of a lot for me
to do at the compound.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.740
What?!
Not a lot to do?!

15:08.860 --> 15:12.110
Mr. Samson, are you not
spiritually and morally outraged...

15:12.240 --> 15:14.530
to find yourself the tenant
of the devil himself?!

15:14.660 --> 15:15.620
Huh?

15:15.740 --> 15:17.160
Oh, well, sure,
you know, I was pissed...

15:17.290 --> 15:19.790
when he told me
I'd have to start paying rent.

15:19.910 --> 15:21.790
Even more when
he gave me a retroactive bill...

15:21.920 --> 15:24.000
for the last two years.

15:24.130 --> 15:28.590
But he explained
how I could write it all off...

15:28.710 --> 15:32.510
so now I'm getting
way more back from the I .R .S.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.390
and I come out
ahead of the game.

15:35.510 --> 15:37.890
But what of your boys?

15:38.020 --> 15:41.180
Surely you don't think them safe
in the hands of the beast!

15:41.310 --> 15:44.020
Gods, he's probably
shaking them as we speak!

15:44.150 --> 15:46.650
Shaking them
like a nanny possessed!

15:46.770 --> 15:47.690
The boys?

15:47.820 --> 15:49.820
No, no, no, no,
he's crazy about them...

15:49.940 --> 15:51.780
and they're crazy about him.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.450
Where's Hank?

15:56.910 --> 15:59.410
Dean's really excelling in his studies...

15:59.540 --> 16:02.830
getting great progress printouts
from his learning bed...

16:02.960 --> 16:05.540
which I got to credit to Killinger's tutoring.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.710
Well, what did we learn?

16:07.840 --> 16:10.420
I'm not sure about some
of the stuff he's teaching Hank.

16:10.550 --> 16:12.550
This man stole from your father.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.550
Teach him the meaning of loyalty.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.760
But he's got a PHD in child psychology...

16:17.890 --> 16:20.720
so, you know, whatever.

16:20.850 --> 16:24.230
Have you not
the eyes to see what he's doing?!

16:24.350 --> 16:26.560
I have touched his mind!

16:26.690 --> 16:28.980
His is the way
of the serpent and the apple!

16:29.110 --> 16:31.610
He's seduced your employer
with the poison promises...

16:31.740 --> 16:33.400
of a Faustian covenant...

16:33.530 --> 16:37.870
giving with one hand as he macerates
your souls with the other!

16:37.990 --> 16:40.160
We must stop him at once! !

16:41.750 --> 16:42.660
Oh.

16:42.790 --> 16:44.660
I'm not sure about this.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.250
If you want to be a power player...

16:46.380 --> 16:48.080
you need to look like one.

16:48.210 --> 16:49.790
How is the fit?

16:50.960 --> 16:53.010
Snug, but there's room.

16:53.130 --> 16:54.340
You'll grow into it.

16:54.470 --> 16:55.970
Well, it's... different.

16:56.090 --> 16:59.430
Richard Nixon said the same thing
when I gave him his first power tie.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
What do these things do?

17:00.680 --> 17:03.930
This one is for your diet pills,
and this is for what have you.

17:04.060 --> 17:04.980
Hmm.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.940
Hm.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.359
- I like it.
- Ah.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.859
I-I'm sorry...

17:12.150 --> 17:14.359
I've become the proud papa.

17:14.490 --> 17:15.859
Oh.

17:15.990 --> 17:18.240
I love mein job.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.410
- Whew! Hey-o!
- Shh!

17:28.920 --> 17:30.130
Ah, shit. That's new.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.750
Intruders on the grounds.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.340
Should we call it in to the doctor?

17:34.510 --> 17:37.090
Magic cloak of concealment!

17:41.260 --> 17:43.970
Hurry, now.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.310
Oh, please hurry.

17:45.430 --> 17:48.480
Can't... keep... it... up!

17:48.600 --> 17:49.810
Oh!

17:53.320 --> 17:55.030
The universe wants you to be happy...

17:55.150 --> 17:57.320
und have all the things you want in life.

17:57.450 --> 18:00.990
She is waiting to pour out
her bounty of blessings upon you.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.830
Visualize the things you want
in your mind's eye.

18:04.950 --> 18:07.500
If they belong to someone else, take them.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.000
We will cover lethal force in the next--

18:13.460 --> 18:15.380
Why are we putting on these getups,
again?

18:15.510 --> 18:18.340
Because he knows my face
and because he's magic.

18:18.470 --> 18:20.260
What are we, chopped liver?

18:20.390 --> 18:22.430
We're somewhat less magic,
so we must resort to...

18:22.550 --> 18:24.850
Mr. Samson's plan
of subterfuge and attack.

18:24.970 --> 18:25.970
Are you finished?

18:27.020 --> 18:30.350
I'm very excited about this plan.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.400
Ow!

18:31.520 --> 18:32.770
I thought I gave you power of attorney...

18:32.900 --> 18:34.690
so I wouldn't have to
be bothered with this kind of crap!

18:34.820 --> 18:36.070
This is different.

18:36.190 --> 18:38.240
It must be in your own hand
und only in blood.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.860
Well, you've got enough of it
to print a KISS comic book with.

18:40.990 --> 18:42.620
What the hell am I signing,
a Zeppelin?

18:42.740 --> 18:44.120
A most sacred pact--

18:44.240 --> 18:46.200
membership in the most
elite brotherhood...

18:46.330 --> 18:48.410
mit exclusive arching rights.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.210
Didn't have to go through all...

18:50.330 --> 18:53.000
this hooey to get my first archenemy,
but what the hey?

18:53.130 --> 18:54.090
Did you pick me a good one?

18:54.210 --> 18:56.050
No. You did.

18:56.170 --> 18:57.210
What?!

18:57.340 --> 18:58.380
My brother?!

18:58.510 --> 18:59.420
Bingo.

18:59.550 --> 19:01.300
Isn't it perfect?

19:01.430 --> 19:04.550
It's a classic Cain und Abel story.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.890
Well-- but--
but he can't arch me.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.060
He's not even a super--

19:09.180 --> 19:10.390
Oh, my god.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.400
This is-- but I'm not a...

19:12.520 --> 19:13.480
Aren't you?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.770
Is this not what your heart
was trying to tell you...

19:15.900 --> 19:16.860
in your visions?

19:16.980 --> 19:17.900
Sign it!

19:18.030 --> 19:20.150
Make your blood feud official!

19:20.280 --> 19:21.360
Act now!

19:21.490 --> 19:24.410
Venchmen are standing by for your order!

19:27.740 --> 19:28.700
Ready, Dr. O?

19:28.830 --> 19:29.870
On 3.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.120
1 ...2...

19:34.880 --> 19:37.550
Uh, gee,
would you-- oh!

19:38.920 --> 19:40.550
Would you...
Ugh!

19:41.550 --> 19:42.470
The fiend!

19:42.590 --> 19:45.090
It's as if he's cast
a spell of binding on the machine!

19:46.100 --> 19:47.890
OK, OK, plan "B."

19:48.020 --> 19:50.220
Al, take the door.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.570
I swear, this has never
happened to me before.

19:57.690 --> 19:59.900
Oh, does nothing work in this place?!

20:03.030 --> 20:04.820
We're too late!

20:04.950 --> 20:07.030
Venchmen!

20:08.660 --> 20:09.660
Aah!

20:14.750 --> 20:16.290
This is it.

20:17.340 --> 20:18.540
Excuse me.

20:18.670 --> 20:19.880
Excuse me, pardon me.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.470
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

20:22.590 --> 20:24.760
Thanks for this opportunity.

20:26.140 --> 20:27.300
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

20:27.430 --> 20:30.100
Hey, nice working with you, man.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.140
Doc, you OK?

20:31.270 --> 20:32.980
I-I don't know.

20:33.100 --> 20:38.730
I-- he-- he thinks I'm a--
Brock, am I a...

20:38.860 --> 20:39.820
bad person?

20:39.940 --> 20:41.030
What the hell just happened?

20:41.150 --> 20:42.490
Am I, Brock?!

20:42.610 --> 20:43.990
Uh...

20:44.110 --> 20:46.990
Where is the one called Killinger?!

20:47.120 --> 20:48.990
Uh, he-- he left.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.330
Uncle Henry's gone?

20:50.450 --> 20:51.370
No!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.290
But we saw you sign...

20:53.410 --> 20:54.660
His severance agreement.

20:54.790 --> 20:57.000
I didn't sign the--
the other thing.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.250
So he thanked me for my time...

20:59.380 --> 21:03.260
wished me luck,
and then just flew out the window.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.050
With your pants?

21:05.180 --> 21:06.470
Is that the severance package?

21:06.590 --> 21:07.590
That sucks.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.510
Well, did he at least leave a note?!

21:09.640 --> 21:11.680
He's supposed to take me
rock climbing tomorrow!

21:11.810 --> 21:14.020
Oh, hell, I'll take you, Aqualad.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.520
Hold me, Brock?

21:15.640 --> 21:16.770
Uh, no.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.940
Please?

21:18.060 --> 21:20.400
I feel so empty.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
What?

21:21.650 --> 21:24.240
You guys said you wanted to help...

21:24.360 --> 21:26.650
"Not with a stolen dick."

21:27.660 --> 21:29.820
"All the world's a stage...

21:29.950 --> 21:32.370
"und all the men
and women merely players.

21:32.490 --> 21:35.290
"They have their exits
and their entrances...

21:35.410 --> 21:38.790
"und one man
in his time plays many parts...

21:38.920 --> 21:40.880
"his acts being seven ages."

21:41.000 --> 21:43.170
Ha ha! You said it, killer!

21:43.300 --> 21:45.760
And you can read
more about it in the Bible.

22:13.950 --> 22:18.660
Bill, bill, bill, final notice.

22:18.790 --> 22:19.960
Hmm.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.050
Ugh!

22:30.180 --> 22:33.470
Oh! June 6, 2003?!
