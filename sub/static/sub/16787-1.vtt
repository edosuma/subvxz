Hilary Barry: <i>It's been a
harrowing week in the news,</i>

00:29.993 --> 00:32.615
<i>so now it's something much
lighter and more fun.</i>

00:32.712 --> 00:36.037
<i>It's time for New Zealand's
favorite pop culture reporter,</i>

00:36.135 --> 00:37.157
<i>David Farrier.</i>

00:42.149 --> 00:44.739
David: <i>What do you make
of New Zealanders so far?</i>

00:44.837 --> 00:47.874
Me? Uh, I think that they're...
They've been nice.

00:47.972 --> 00:49.217
Everyone has been cool so far.

00:51.587 --> 00:53.249
David: <i>What's the main thing
you're trying to achieve here?</i>

00:53.347 --> 00:55.617
Because obviously
you've created a bit of a...

00:55.715 --> 00:57.024
Survival.

00:59.361 --> 01:00.383
He's dead.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.740
- Now we're gonna spin around.
- Yeah.

01:09.086 --> 01:10.299
Whoa! Holy!

01:14.589 --> 01:16.666
It's so tiring. Whoa!

01:19.259 --> 01:21.340
David: <i>And what's your nickname
that you've got now?</i>

01:21.658 --> 01:22.904
The donkey lady.

01:24.504 --> 01:25.945
Lady: Look out!
Oh, look, we're going

01:26.040 --> 01:27.413
to have a reporter kicked.

01:27.511 --> 01:28.597
It's quite a kick.

01:37.654 --> 01:39.060
David: I <i> can't say I've ever</i>
<i>interviewed anyone</i>

01:39.158 --> 01:41.139
that looks
exactly like you before.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.378
Really?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.818
David: <i>I've made a career out of
looking at the weird</i>

02:00.915 --> 02:02.737
<i>and bizarre side of life.</i>

02:04.210 --> 02:06.767
<i>So when I discovered a strange
video online,</i>

02:06.897 --> 02:08.877
<i>I knew I'd found
my next story.</i>

02:11.311 --> 02:13.549
Man:
<i>It's good. It's good.</i>

02:17.262 --> 02:19.787
David: <i>An American company
called Jane O’Brien media</i>

02:19.885 --> 02:21.163
<i>was running a monthly event.</i>

02:23.148 --> 02:26.026
<i>Young athletes from anywhere
on the planet could apply.</i>

02:26.124 --> 02:28.361
<i>If selected they got
free flights to la,</i>

02:28.491 --> 02:32.488
<i>four nights in a really
nice hotel and $1500 cash.</i>

02:33.769 --> 02:36.838
<i>It was called competitive
endurance tickling.</i>

02:38.440 --> 02:39.590
Man: <i> You're with the cet,</i>

02:39.719 --> 02:41.765
a competitive endurance tickling
group we got here.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.068
And, uh, first of all I'd like
to give a shout to you,

02:44.166 --> 02:46.339
Jane O’Brien media,
for making this happen.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.803
- Thanks, Jane.
- We all appreciate it.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.025
Fuck off!

03:02.114 --> 03:06.783
Guys! Oh, my god!

03:09.792 --> 03:11.710
David: <i>Their Facebook page
was popular,</i>

03:11.808 --> 03:13.693
<i>with thousands of likes.</i>

03:14.014 --> 03:15.676
<i>And with everyone in
Adidas gear,</i>

03:15.774 --> 03:18.459
<i>it seemed to be some
kind of tickling league.</i>

03:25.116 --> 03:27.994
David: <i>It was one of
the strangest sports I'd seen.</i>

03:28.188 --> 03:29.626
Man: <i> No!</i>

03:32.827 --> 03:35.289
David: <i>So, of course,
I told Jane O’Brien media</i>

03:35.387 --> 03:36.697
<i>I'd like to do an interview.</i>

03:38.170 --> 03:41.430
<i>Instead of getting a
yes or no, I got this.</i>

03:42.008 --> 03:43.510
Woman: <i> "To be brutally frank,</i>"

03:43.607 --> 03:45.653
<i>association with a
homosexual journalist</i>

03:45.751 --> 03:47.765
<i>is not something
we will embrace.</i>

03:47.863 --> 03:50.485
<i>We desperately do not want
a homosexual participant base</i>

03:50.583 --> 03:52.340
<i>applying for this project.</i>

03:52.438 --> 03:55.284
<i>My concern is that your
journalistic style, fan base,</i>

03:55.382 --> 03:57.907
<i>and reputation
in your own country.</i>

03:58.005 --> 04:01.331
<i>"Regards, Debbie Kuhn,
Jane O’Brien media."</i>

04:05.427 --> 04:07.121
David:
<i>It was a strange response,</i>

04:07.219 --> 04:09.585
<i>especially considering the
sport did seem slightly...</i>

04:11.377 --> 04:12.655
<i>Gay.</i>

04:14.959 --> 04:18.733
<i>And over the coming weeks,
Debbie and Jane kept e-mailing.</i>

04:18.831 --> 04:20.493
Woman: <i>"The competitive

04:20.591 --> 04:21.612

04:21.613 --> 04:24.972

athletic endurance activity.</i>

04:25.070 --> 04:27.659
<i>We have recently read a googled
article about the knowledge</i>

04:27.757 --> 04:29.642
<i>of your living with a
homosexual partner</i>

04:29.740 --> 04:31.301
<i>"becoming quite a stir

<i>"The remainder of the globe

<i>"To me anything concerning
homosexuality</i>

04:38.825 --> 04:40.550
<i>is at best
an objective disorder."</i>

04:40.648 --> 04:43.654
<i>"Shame on you!"
"Little gay kiwis." "Faggot."</i>

04:47.207 --> 04:49.636
David: <i>It was hard to take
the insults seriously,</i>

04:49.734 --> 04:51.524
<i>given what Jane was producing.</i>

04:53.029 --> 04:56.195
<i>If anything, it made me
more curious than ever.</i>

04:58.884 --> 05:00.450
Woman: <i>Your call
has been forwarded</i>

05:00.547 --> 05:03.713
<i>to the voicemail for
Jane O’Brien media.</i>

05:08.994 --> 05:09.824
David: <i>With no one picking up
the phone,</i>

05:09.922 --> 05:12.128
<i>I got my geeky friend Dylan
to do some digging</i>

05:12.226 --> 05:14.144
<i>into this mysterious company</i>

05:14.241 --> 05:16.127
<i>and this overly
aggressive woman.</i>

05:16.225 --> 05:18.718
Dylan: So, I'm going to just
scroll up. So here we go.

05:18.816 --> 05:20.381
So, it's janeobrienmedia.com.

05:20.479 --> 05:22.141
It's registered to Nederdietsen.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.476
David: <i>He discovered that while
Jane O’Brien media</i>

05:24.574 --> 05:26.780
<i>seemed to be
operated out of America,</i>

05:26.878 --> 05:30.300
<i>it was owned by a company in
Germany called Nederdietsen,</i>

05:30.397 --> 05:35.003
<i>which owned nearly 300 domain
names all related to tickling.</i>

05:39.293 --> 05:41.722
<i>This tickling wormhole was
getting deeper,</i>

05:41.820 --> 05:44.665
<i>so Dylan and I
blogged about what we'd found.</i>

05:59.159 --> 06:00.757
Man: <i> So, the pay's good.</i>

06:00.855 --> 06:03.988
Man: <i> What? Okay, hold on.</i>

06:04.086 --> 06:06.196
David: <i>Our story
got a lot of attention,</i>

06:06.293 --> 06:08.274
<i>being picked up
on websites like reddit</i>

06:08.277 --> 06:10.098
<i>and an American podcast.</i>

06:10.196 --> 06:12.036
<i>- </i> Man 1: <i> Back up. Back up.</i>
- Man 2: <i> When I say</i>

06:12.083 --> 06:14.225
<i>competitive tickling, what do
you think I'm talking about?</i>

06:14.322 --> 06:16.528
Man 1: <i>I mean, I think you're
talking about, uh,</i>

06:16.626 --> 06:18.512
<i>some sort of organized sport...</i>

06:18.609 --> 06:20.207
<i>- </i> man 2: <i> Yeah.</i>
<i>- ...Of tickling.</i>

06:20.305 --> 06:22.190
Man 2: <i>Basically what happened
was this kind of blew up</i>

06:22.288 --> 06:25.710
<i>on the Internet this week,
because a dude in New Zealand,</i>

06:25.808 --> 06:30.669
<i>a reporter, like, happened
across this Facebook page.</i>

06:30.799 --> 06:32.519
Man 1: <i>But is it just for fun?
They just...</i>

06:32.559 --> 06:33.740
<i>I mean,
obviously it's just for fun?</i>

06:33.838 --> 06:34.924
Man 2: <i> Is it just for fun?</i>

06:35.021 --> 06:36.043
<i>It's tickling.</i>

06:36.045 --> 06:38.026
Man 1: <i>Sorry, I don't think that
question's ever been asked</i>

06:38.028 --> 06:40.457
<i>about tickling before.
It's like a martian question</i>

06:40.555 --> 06:42.601
<i>- about tickling.
- "Is it for fun?"</i>

06:43.307 --> 06:46.216
David: <i>People were so interested
by what we discovered,</i>

06:46.314 --> 06:48.616
<i>Dylan and I decided to make
a documentary</i>

06:48.714 --> 06:51.175
<i>about this
utterly bizarre subject.</i>

07:07.816 --> 07:08.870
<i>Two weeks later,</i>

07:08.872 --> 07:11.142
<i>we heard from Jane O'brien's
New York attorney,</i>

07:11.240 --> 07:12.742
<i>Romeo Salta.</i>

07:14.535 --> 07:16.453
<i>He'd recently made
headlines in a case</i>

07:16.518 --> 07:18.052
<i>involving a gay porn star</i>

07:18.149 --> 07:19.171
<i>who chopped a man up</i>

07:19.173 --> 07:21.891
<i>and mailed his body parts
to some politicians.</i>

07:22.597 --> 07:25.410
<i>Things certainly weren't
getting any less weird.</i>

07:26.531 --> 07:30.433
<i>His letter told us to stop
what we were doing, or else.</i>

07:34.722 --> 07:37.663
<i>Soon we were receiving e-mails
from Salta telling us</i>

07:37.761 --> 07:40.862
<i>that legal action
had been filed in the us.</i>

07:46.592 --> 07:49.149
<i>I had no money to hire a
New Zealand lawyer,</i>

07:49.247 --> 07:52.124
<i>let alone face
the American justice system.</i>

07:53.790 --> 07:57.244
<i>Then, to top it all off,
Jane O’Brien media told us</i>

07:57.342 --> 08:00.411
<i>they were flying three people
across the world from New York</i>

08:00.509 --> 08:02.331
<i>to New Zealand to see us.</i>

08:02.939 --> 08:05.881
<i>They're clearly serious about
stopping this documentary.</i>

08:18.264 --> 08:21.205
<i>Jane wouldn't tell us what
flight they were arriving on,</i>

08:21.303 --> 08:22.997
<i>but she did tell us the day.</i>

08:23.095 --> 08:26.516
<i>So from 05:00 am,
I waited at arrivals.</i>

08:28.277 --> 08:29.875
<i>Not sure what to expect,</i>

08:30.036 --> 08:32.049
<i>I figured I'd disarm
the situation</i>

08:32.148 --> 08:33.938
<i>with a rainbow-colored sign.</i>

08:44.659 --> 08:45.840
David: How's it going?

08:47.794 --> 08:49.712
I thought I'd make up
a good welcoming sign.

08:50.066 --> 08:51.439
Good. How are you, sir?

08:52.785 --> 08:55.105
That's all right. I thought
I'd arrive. How was the flight?

08:55.792 --> 08:58.030
Oh, good.
Air New Zealand?

08:58.543 --> 09:00.909
Oh, good. Hey, guys.

09:02.030 --> 09:05.323
Kevin, nice to meet you, sir.
David. Nice to meet you.

09:09.228 --> 09:11.850
You can. I gift this to you.

09:11.948 --> 09:13.834
As a sign, I thought
it was pretty good.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.544
Well, look, let's line up
a time to meet this week.

09:17.738 --> 09:20.679
Marko:

09:20.809 --> 09:21.830
David: Tomorrow?

09:21.928 --> 09:22.949
- Adam:
- Marko:

09:23.047 --> 09:24.485
David:
Okay, tomorrow works well.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.724
- Kevin:
- Marko:

09:26.822 --> 09:29.315
David: Oh, that's okay. It's the
New Zealand hospitality.

09:30.725 --> 09:32.245
- David: You can get me there.
- Kevin:

09:33.444 --> 09:36.193
David: Yeah, we're just rolling
from the beginning. Yeah, yeah.

09:37.474 --> 09:39.295
Okay. We've got a thing
in New Zealand,

09:39.393 --> 09:41.599
we're okay to film
in public spaces.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.318
So I'm just following
the journey.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.452
Okay, all right. Well, we're...

09:51.613 --> 09:53.690
Adam:

09:53.852 --> 09:54.873
It's not...

09:54.875 --> 09:57.075
David: Okay. Well, I mean,
we're shooting a documentary,

09:57.114 --> 09:59.512
so we'll keep... it's a...

10:00.249 --> 10:01.303
David: Mm.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.462
David: Okay.

10:05.464 --> 10:08.661
Okay. We're okay to film in
public spaces in New Zealand,

10:08.759 --> 10:10.900
so we're doing that here.

10:11.798 --> 10:13.239
David:
All right, we'll see you soon.

10:13.302 --> 10:14.702
- Marko:
- David: Okay, sounds good.

10:15.670 --> 10:16.787
All right, see you soon.

10:18.260 --> 10:19.729
David:
No worries. We'll talk soon.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.255
Marko:

10:34.257 --> 10:37.262
David: <i>Hey, Marko.
It's Dave Farrier. How are you?</i>

10:39.184 --> 10:41.422
<i>Yeah, good. How are you
settling into Auckland?</i>

10:54.415 --> 10:56.204
Okay. No, that sounds
good to me, I think.

10:56.302 --> 10:59.820
Just, Dylan and I both talked,
and we just weren't confident,

10:59.918 --> 11:01.239
or didn't think it was
a good idea

11:01.389 --> 11:03.850
just to go straight to a room.
Maybe it's a cultural thing.

11:05.547 --> 11:07.241
<i>But a conference room</i>

11:07.339 --> 11:08.937
- <i>um, of your choosing,</i>
<i>- </i> Marko: <i> Okay.</i>

11:09.034 --> 11:11.976
<i>Whether it's at the Hilton or
elsewhere, is absolutely fine.</i>

11:14.889 --> 11:17.768
Marko:

11:31.016 --> 11:32.326
Marko: <i> And, um...</i>

11:50.183 --> 11:51.333
David:

11:51.654 --> 11:53.668
Marko:

12:07.621 --> 12:10.307
Dylan:

12:12.612 --> 12:14.594
Marko:

12:24.099 --> 12:25.409
Dylan:

12:25.538 --> 12:26.688
Kevin:

12:26.786 --> 12:28.767
Dylan:

12:29.984 --> 12:30.984
Kevin:

12:31.167 --> 12:33.277
Dylan:

12:33.374 --> 12:37.947
Kevin:

12:39.997 --> 12:40.826
David: Sure.

12:40.924 --> 12:43.674
Dylan:

12:43.771 --> 12:47.993
David:

12:57.179 --> 12:59.000
Kevin:

13:23.510 --> 13:25.300
David: <i>Kevin didn't take
to Dylan very well</i>

13:25.398 --> 13:27.316
<i>and wants to meet me alone.</i>

13:28.533 --> 13:31.186
<i>I quickly make this
covert piece of technology.</i>

13:31.603 --> 13:33.745
<i>A camera in a coffee cup.</i>

13:37.650 --> 13:39.632
Kevin: What's the end game here?
What do you get at the end

13:39.729 --> 13:41.071
or even if you get everything
you want?

13:41.169 --> 13:44.175
- David: Mm. Mm.
- And what are we risking here?

13:45.072 --> 13:48.813
You know, do we really want
someone coming after you

13:48.911 --> 13:50.349
with all that money?

13:50.926 --> 13:52.364
I've known a lot of
rich people in my life.

13:52.462 --> 13:53.483
I've worked for a lot of them.

13:53.581 --> 13:55.851
They don't work by the
same set of rules.

13:55.949 --> 13:57.930
They don't dangle them out
of buildings any more,

13:58.028 --> 13:59.786
but they don't have to.

13:59.884 --> 14:02.569
And that's the thing.
They start suing,

14:02.954 --> 14:05.768
and you're done halfway through
or a quarter of the way through

14:05.898 --> 14:08.039
because it costs so much
to defend yourself.

14:08.105 --> 14:09.767
David: So unless...
Essentially, I mean,

14:09.896 --> 14:12.614
unless we stop the doco,
we're gonna be fucked.

14:12.871 --> 14:14.278
Really. It seems that's
what it comes down to.

14:14.407 --> 14:16.453
Kevin: I'm not gonna use those
words directly,

14:16.551 --> 14:18.757
because that wouldn't
be prudent.

14:18.854 --> 14:21.732
But... let me rephrase.
Unless you stopped...

14:21.830 --> 14:24.452
Unless we can figure out a way
to ameliorate that situation,

14:24.550 --> 14:26.308
we all are.

14:32.325 --> 14:35.427
David: <i>Facing lawsuits and
a company with deep pockets,</i>

14:35.524 --> 14:37.858
<i>I wondered if we should
just walk away.</i>

14:40.963 --> 14:42.657
<i>But Dylan was part of this now</i>

14:42.755 --> 14:45.536
<i>and didn't want to give in to
a bunch of bullies.</i>

14:46.594 --> 14:48.895
Kevin: <i>Dylan wants to
pursue this on his own?</i>

14:49.281 --> 14:52.543
David: <i>Uh, I gather from
what he's saying, yeah.</i>

14:52.832 --> 14:55.486
Kevin: <i>Okay.
Um, if Dylan wants to do that,</i>

14:55.584 --> 14:57.821
<i>Dylan does...
Dylan will do that.</i>

14:57.919 --> 15:01.212
<i>If you don't want to do that,
then just walk away from it.</i>

15:01.790 --> 15:03.131
David: <i> Yeah.</i>

15:03.421 --> 15:06.617
Kevin: <i>And I will... Dylan
will be dealt with accordingly.</i>

15:07.259 --> 15:09.465
How was school?

15:09.563 --> 15:12.523
Marko: <i>The main thing, David, you know,
that I wanted to tell you is that</i>

15:12.634 --> 15:13.975
<i>I think that you're brilliant.</i>

15:14.073 --> 15:15.894
<i>And that you have
a great career.</i>

15:15.992 --> 15:18.325
<i>So I was really,
really happy to find out</i>

15:18.423 --> 15:21.397
<i>that you wanted just to
distance yourself from it.</i>

15:21.495 --> 15:25.973
<i>And I don't understand why
Dylan would not want to.</i>

15:27.670 --> 15:29.076
<i>What I'm worried about too,
I know Kevin says,</i>

15:29.174 --> 15:30.775
<i>"well, if he wants to
go ahead with it,</i>

15:31.957 --> 15:32.659
<i>let him go ahead with it."</i>

15:32.660 --> 15:33.362
<i>But he'll become a real target,
and believe me,</i>

15:33.461 --> 15:34.963
<i>it will be really ugly for him.</i>

15:35.061 --> 15:36.563
<i>And I would...
I would hate to see that too,</i>

15:36.692 --> 15:37.874
<i>because I know he has a family</i>

15:37.875 --> 15:42.193
<i>and, you know, he's probably,
uh, a good bloke down deep.</i>

15:52.977 --> 15:55.310
David: <i>I've never heard threats
like this in my life,</i>

15:55.631 --> 15:58.029
<i>and all of this
over some tickling!</i>

15:58.894 --> 16:01.643
<i>Kevin and Marko fly
back to America.</i>

16:02.508 --> 16:05.610
<i>And a few days later,
Dylan and I follow.</i>

16:06.604 --> 16:09.065
<i>Something about bullies
with way too much money</i>

16:09.163 --> 16:11.049
<i>has convinced me
I shouldn't drop it.</i>

16:11.562 --> 16:15.143
<i>Plus, we think there's a competitive
tickling shoot happening this week.</i>

16:17.384 --> 16:20.325
<i>We've reached out to nearly
a hundred boys in the videos,</i>

16:20.582 --> 16:22.820
<i>but they all seem too
nervous to talk.</i>

16:28.100 --> 16:30.881
<i>Finally TJ agrees to meet us.</i>

16:34.339 --> 16:37.120
<i>We met Kevin Clarke
downtown la somewhere.</i>

16:37.218 --> 16:40.159
<i>I can't remember exactly where
it was at, but it was a studio.</i>

16:41.761 --> 16:43.359
<i>He seemed pretty
normal at the time.</i>

16:44.608 --> 16:46.809
My first impression of him,
you know, he was just, like,

16:47.519 --> 16:48.957
kind of...
Kind of a little weird.

16:51.294 --> 16:52.540
<i>You know,
I was young at the time,</i>

16:52.637 --> 16:53.691
<i>didn't think nothing of it,</i>

16:53.693 --> 16:55.739
<i>and I was like, "cool."
You know, $2000 or whatever,</i>

16:55.837 --> 16:57.114
<i>"yeah. It's gonna be cool."</i>

17:01.307 --> 17:02.776
It was actually a hard
time for my family.

17:02.778 --> 17:06.551
A family member of mine was going through
cancer, and money was tight at the household.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.931
So I was a little bit desperate at the time
as well for money, working on the side,

17:10.009 --> 17:11.830
and doing what I can. So when
I heard this dollar sign,

17:11.929 --> 17:14.128
I was like, "yeah," you know,
"I'll definitely do that."

17:15.768 --> 17:17.269
<i>And then I went inside</i>

17:17.367 --> 17:19.573
<i>and noticed that it was
all guys in there.</i>

17:21.079 --> 17:24.020
<i>And that's when I was like,
"oh, dang!" Like...</i>

17:27.125 --> 17:29.011
<i>And I didn't know I was
gonna get tied down.</i>

17:29.588 --> 17:31.826
<i>I had no idea what it'd be for.</i>

17:31.924 --> 17:33.842
<i>Honestly, I was like,
"okay, what?"</i>

17:35.379 --> 17:38.160
At that point I was like, "all right,
you know what? It's already going down."

17:38.258 --> 17:39.578
I don't really know
what it's for,

17:39.666 --> 17:40.986
"but hopefully
it never gets out."

18:00.781 --> 18:02.250
No, no, no. Not any fuckin'...

18:02.348 --> 18:05.929
Ah! Fuck! That actually
tickles, dude.

18:08.778 --> 18:12.488
Ah! Fuck!

18:12.586 --> 18:15.527
Being violated on so many
different levels right now.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.470
<i>There was other athletes.
There was MMA guys.</i>

18:18.568 --> 18:19.846
<i>There was a bodybuilder,</i>

18:19.975 --> 18:22.885
<i>and then there was a couple
of actors, normal actors.</i>

18:22.983 --> 18:24.389
<i>I've seen some of them on
commercials,</i>

18:24.487 --> 18:26.564
<i>TV commercials. Normal guys.</i>

18:26.662 --> 18:28.994
<i>Like, completely normal people.</i>

18:30.819 --> 18:33.089
Get the fuck off my feet!

18:33.187 --> 18:34.593
<i>It was a torture project.</i>

18:34.691 --> 18:36.992
That's what I believe
Kevin Clarke told me.

18:37.090 --> 18:40.927
There was something to do with even a
military tactic, or something like that.

18:41.025 --> 18:42.623
He was gonna do...

18:42.817 --> 18:45.087
I think he said
Jane was doing a project

18:45.185 --> 18:47.998
on using tickling
as a military tactic.

18:48.096 --> 18:49.150
And at that point, I...

18:49.248 --> 18:51.069
I knew it was complete bullshit,
you know?

18:51.167 --> 18:53.085
I was like, "okay, the military
is gonna use tickling"

18:53.183 --> 18:55.229
as a torture tactic?"

18:55.326 --> 18:57.500
Fuck!

19:00.029 --> 19:03.514
David: <i>When did the video
come back to get you?</i>

19:04.763 --> 19:07.577
About a year, maybe
a little more, ago.

19:16.538 --> 19:18.098
<i>I would Google myself
once in a while,</i>

19:18.137 --> 19:19.191
<i>to read old articles</i>

19:19.193 --> 19:21.313
<i>or see what teams might have
listed me in an article</i>

19:21.368 --> 19:22.390
<i>or try-outs.</i>

19:27.030 --> 19:30.356
<i>And to my surprise,
a video was on YouTube.</i>

19:30.454 --> 19:34.356
Hello. I'm TJ, and I'm here
on a tickling competition.

19:34.453 --> 19:36.819
And, uh, first question is:
"Are you ticklish?"

19:36.917 --> 19:38.931
Well, obviously I'm ticklish if
I'm here, so,

19:39.029 --> 19:40.371
that's kind of
a silly question. But, uh...

19:40.468 --> 19:42.770
<i>It was just me
sitting in front of the camera</i>

19:42.868 --> 19:45.457
<i>talking about the,
uh, tickling process.</i>

19:45.555 --> 19:48.075
Just weird things. And so I was
like, "okay, it's not that bad."

19:48.850 --> 19:50.704
"When you are asked,
'are you ticklish?'

19:50.802 --> 19:53.008
how do you normally
respond and why?"

19:53.362 --> 19:56.784
Normally, I say,
"no, I'm not ticklish."

19:58.673 --> 20:01.870
<i>So I emailed Jane and asked
her to take the video down.</i>

20:05.552 --> 20:07.790
She didn't ever reply.

20:07.887 --> 20:10.125
So I took the matters
into my own hands,

20:10.286 --> 20:12.107
and I, uh, told YouTube that

20:12.205 --> 20:14.219
uh, they're illegally
using my name.

20:17.549 --> 20:21.162
So YouTube took the video down.
That's when it all started.

20:25.323 --> 20:26.921
Woman: <i> "Now, I am laughing."</i>

20:28.106 --> 20:30.376
<i>"I don't think you've grasped
the magnitude</i>

20:30.474 --> 20:31.976
<i>of what you have provoked."</i>

20:32.457 --> 20:34.919
<i>"I'm interested to see how you
handle the fallout.</i>

20:35.017 --> 20:39.398
<i>So far, badly."
"Regards, Debbie J. Kuhn."</i>

20:39.495 --> 20:42.245
<i>That's when this Deborah
person popped into my life.</i>

20:42.343 --> 20:45.349
I mean,
just all hell broke loose.

20:48.327 --> 20:52.389
<i>Every kind of video search you
can find, it was up there.</i>

20:54.118 --> 20:55.876
<i>And then it
pops up in my emails,</i>

20:55.974 --> 20:57.828
<i>and then it pops up
more on YouTube,</i>

20:58.309 --> 20:59.715
<i>and it just starts
appearing everywhere.</i>

20:59.813 --> 21:01.133
<i>This video...
Just, all of them.</i>

21:01.188 --> 21:02.530
<i>All of them start blowing up.</i>

21:11.713 --> 21:13.024
And there was threats.
It said, "watch out!"

21:13.121 --> 21:14.242
Your family better watch out

21:14.401 --> 21:16.190
because we're gonna put your
last name to shame.

21:16.288 --> 21:18.654
"Any time you search your last
name, it's gonna pop up."

21:18.752 --> 21:20.414
Like, direct threats.

21:23.359 --> 21:24.605
<i>They ended up making a website,</i>

21:24.670 --> 21:26.043
<i>putting my
personal information:</i>

21:26.141 --> 21:27.867
<i>My name, my address,</i>

21:27.996 --> 21:30.617
<i>my personal phone number,
my email address,</i>

21:31.579 --> 21:33.464
all with just dumb lies.

21:36.378 --> 21:39.288
<i>Then Debbie Kuhn starts going
off on me left and right,</i>

21:39.386 --> 21:41.687
<i>sending emails to the
high school that I coach at.</i>

21:42.200 --> 21:45.078
Woman: <i>"I have additional
information as a past employer.</i>

21:45.176 --> 21:46.934
<i>You don't want this
guy in your league.</i>

21:47.032 --> 21:49.654
<i>Can you afford the distraction,
the press,</i>

21:49.752 --> 21:52.982
<i>with an outed gay guy
having a male tickling fetish,</i>

21:53.080 --> 21:54.998
<i>in which he likes to tickle
and be tickled</i>

21:55.096 --> 21:58.037
<i>"by tied-up other gay
athletes and bodybuilders?"</i>

21:58.135 --> 21:59.895
<i>False accusations,
saying I'm a drug addict</i>

21:59.958 --> 22:02.420
and I was a child molester
and I'm gay, and this and that,

22:02.518 --> 22:04.532
which none of those things
have ever been true.

22:20.276 --> 22:21.970
<i>I've always been very proud.</i>

22:22.068 --> 22:23.730
<i>The way I walk around,
I'm proud of who I am.</i>

22:23.828 --> 22:25.073
<i>You know what I mean?
So to speak.</i>

22:25.171 --> 22:26.513
<i>I'm confident in myself
as an athlete,</i>

22:26.611 --> 22:27.921
<i>as a person, as a player.</i>

22:29.170 --> 22:30.416
<i>But when I'd go to try-outs,</i>

22:30.514 --> 22:32.368
<i>the first thing
I would think about is,</i>

22:32.466 --> 22:34.906
<i>"well, I wonder if these coaches
have looked up that video?"</i>

22:36.689 --> 22:38.130
<i>And it's happened.
It has happened.</i>

22:38.225 --> 22:39.854
<i>I've been released
from football teams.</i>

22:39.952 --> 22:41.229
<i>They've told me, uh,</i>

22:41.327 --> 22:43.917
that I'm the best player
on that team at that position,

22:44.046 --> 22:46.731
but because it is
a distraction for the media,

22:46.829 --> 22:47.787
they don't need that attention

22:47.789 --> 22:50.347
and they'll go with somebody else 'cause
they don't feel like explaining it.

22:50.349 --> 22:54.602
<i>You know, and I've actually dealt
with a lot of things because of it.</i>

22:56.044 --> 22:58.922
It's cost me money, it's cost me
jobs, it's caused me harassment,

22:59.019 --> 23:02.025
which is exactly what Debbie
Kuhn and Jane O’Brien wanted.

23:02.123 --> 23:04.808
So, I mean, more or less in
that aspect, they've won.

23:14.376 --> 23:16.998
David: <i>It's obvious we're not
the only ones being harassed</i>

23:17.095 --> 23:18.725
<i>by Jane O’Brien media.</i>

23:18.823 --> 23:22.181
<i>And there are so many websites
made up like tj's</i>

23:22.278 --> 23:23.908
<i>which seem to exist purely</i>

23:24.005 --> 23:25.955
<i>to shame the guys
who've been tickled.</i>

23:29.060 --> 23:32.353
<i>What goes on at these shoots,
and why is she so aggressive?</i>

23:34.498 --> 23:36.000
<i>Dylan's been doing
some research,</i>

23:36.098 --> 23:38.752
<i>and he thinks he knows where
the next shoot is happening.</i>

23:40.801 --> 23:43.071
<i>We stake out the studio,
hoping to find out</i>

23:43.169 --> 23:46.110
<i>how a competitive
tickling shoot goes down.</i>

23:47.040 --> 23:48.221
Dominic: Okay, car.

23:54.749 --> 23:56.507
And another car. Two cars.

23:56.828 --> 23:58.234
David: Two cars.

24:03.868 --> 24:05.178
Dominic: Can you see
what the car's doing?

24:05.276 --> 24:06.426
I've lost him.

24:10.843 --> 24:12.924
- Dominic: Who's that guy?
- David: Oh, that's Marko.

24:15.483 --> 24:18.649
Dylan: Oh, yeah. And we've got
four guys going in so far.

24:18.746 --> 24:20.056
Dominic: Four guys.

24:24.474 --> 24:25.994
Dylan: That's the guy
from New Zealand.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.574
David: Yep, there's Kevin.

24:48.598 --> 24:51.188
David: <i>We could hear laughter
coming out of the vents.</i>

24:55.124 --> 24:57.201
<i>It went on for hours,</i>

24:58.867 --> 25:01.329
<i>the boys occasionally
taking breaks.</i>

25:13.202 --> 25:15.162
You know, this is actually
fucking creepy as fuck.

25:15.218 --> 25:17.103
Dylan: Like, this feels
to me like a pep talk.

25:17.232 --> 25:18.254
Dominic: Yeah.

25:19.951 --> 25:21.197
David: <i> As the day wraps up,</i>

25:21.295 --> 25:23.437
<i>I want to give Kevin
one last chance</i>

25:23.534 --> 25:25.420
<i>to talk about what's going on.</i>

25:26.957 --> 25:28.235
<i>With pending lawsuits,</i>

25:28.332 --> 25:31.594
<i>I'm cautious and don't want to
storm into the studio.</i>

25:33.708 --> 25:34.793
David:
They haven't locked the door.

25:34.891 --> 25:36.392
Dylan: I think we go.

25:39.050 --> 25:40.519
All right. Okay, let's go.

25:41.225 --> 25:43.206
- David: We're good?
- Dominic: Yep, we're good.

25:53.256 --> 25:54.373
Dominic: Come this way.

25:55.815 --> 25:58.404
David: Here we go.
We've been spotted.

26:07.813 --> 26:11.395
Hello, Marko. Hey, guys.

26:20.069 --> 26:21.282
Adam, how's it going?

26:21.380 --> 26:22.945
Adam:

26:24.803 --> 26:26.113
Hello, sir.

26:26.306 --> 26:27.808
Kevin:

26:28.290 --> 26:29.471
We're not welcome here?

26:32.864 --> 26:34.462
All right.
Well, we'll head off.

26:35.424 --> 26:36.862
You don't want to do
any final chats or anything?

26:36.959 --> 26:38.109
Last opportunity.

26:43.039 --> 26:44.316
That's all we can do.

26:51.645 --> 26:53.595
<i>Turn right
on Bellevue Avenue,</i>

26:53.693 --> 26:55.386
<i>then take the first right.</i>

26:56.796 --> 27:00.506
I think... yeah, uh,
after New Zealand and that,

27:00.604 --> 27:03.641
I think it's
safe to say that we don't...

27:03.739 --> 27:06.072
We don't have an interview
with Kevin or Marko.

27:06.714 --> 27:07.959
<i>And we certainly
weren't getting</i>

27:08.057 --> 27:10.838
<i>any more of the competitors
to talk on camera.</i>

27:10.936 --> 27:12.694
<i>They were all too terrified,</i>

27:12.792 --> 27:16.533
<i>hoping if they stayed quiet,
the harassment would go away.</i>

27:18.710 --> 27:20.948
Dylan: I mean, are we making the
whole thing worse for everyone

27:21.046 --> 27:22.579
just by even being here?

27:22.677 --> 27:24.339
David: Yeah.
I think it's possible.

27:24.437 --> 27:27.378
I worry that we make it
worse for some people who...

27:27.668 --> 27:29.265
Who've gotten through the
worst of it, you know?

27:29.363 --> 27:30.385
Dylan: Mm.

27:46.705 --> 27:48.910
David: <i>Jane O’Brien clearly
isn't being honest</i>

27:49.008 --> 27:50.510
<i>about what the videos are for.</i>

27:50.864 --> 27:53.166
<i>And I'm convinced that despite
the Adidas gear,</i>

27:53.264 --> 27:55.629
<i>it's not a real sport.</i>

28:00.143 --> 28:01.868
<i>I've tracked down
a man in Florida</i>

28:01.966 --> 28:03.980
<i>who also makes tickling videos,</i>

28:04.078 --> 28:07.531
<i>but, unlike Jane, is more
than happy to talk about it.</i>

28:35.980 --> 28:38.985
Richard: <i>People ask me about
what is the appeal of tickling?</i>

28:40.395 --> 28:42.984
<i>It's kind of like the whips
and chains, you know,</i>

28:43.082 --> 28:45.575
<i>bondage sort of thing, where
somebody's getting flogged.</i>

28:45.673 --> 28:48.966
<i>But it's just really brought
down a level, you know?</i>

28:49.064 --> 28:50.694
<i>It's like kind of a sadistic</i>

28:50.792 --> 28:53.062
<i>exerting your will
on someone else,</i>

28:53.159 --> 28:55.173
<i>and having them do something
out of their control</i>

28:55.271 --> 28:57.796
<i>like laughing without
being able to get away,</i>

28:57.991 --> 29:00.996
<i>as if it's, uh,
tickle torture to them.</i>

29:02.310 --> 29:03.811
David: And a lot of people
don't seem to know

29:03.909 --> 29:05.571
about the tickling fetish.

29:05.669 --> 29:07.299
Do you think it's a little bit
more unknown?

29:07.396 --> 29:09.346
Oh, totally.
Yeah, completely.

29:09.444 --> 29:11.906
'Cause most people, you know,
know about a foot fetish,

29:12.707 --> 29:14.273
um, but tickling?

29:14.370 --> 29:16.544
Most people are like,
"oh, wow. Is that a thing?"

29:18.849 --> 29:24.414
<i>It was in 1999. I had just
gotten out of grad school,</i>

29:25.983 --> 29:27.741
<i>you know, so I just got
a video camera,</i>

29:27.839 --> 29:29.373
<i>put together a little
business plan,</i>

29:30.462 --> 29:31.484
<i>talked to one of my friends</i>

29:31.486 --> 29:33.531
<i>and he financed me,
when I started the site,</i>

29:33.629 --> 29:35.930
<i>I think for $6000 or $7000.</i>

29:37.627 --> 29:39.737
<i>It got pretty much an
immediate response.</i>

29:52.633 --> 29:53.783
<i>I was making enough
after a year</i>

29:53.881 --> 29:55.735
<i>to quit my job
and do it full-time.</i>

29:59.416 --> 30:00.501
David: <i> So this is it?</i>

30:00.791 --> 30:02.260
- This is it.
- This is the studio.

30:02.358 --> 30:04.243
- Mm-hm.
- The chair.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.114
And then the changing room,
bathroom.

30:08.308 --> 30:10.833
And so, this whole place
is purely for the tickling?

30:10.931 --> 30:12.048
Yes.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.775
David: <i>Oh, so you've got a few
different spaces, right?</i>

30:17.873 --> 30:18.927
Richard: <i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

30:19.025 --> 30:20.590
<i>I used to do all this
out of my house.</i>

30:20.751 --> 30:21.613
David: <i> Yeah.</i>

30:21.615 --> 30:24.076
And then it was, you know,
a parade of people coming in,

30:24.174 --> 30:26.828
do all this, have to clean up.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.675
You know, have to clean
it up before a shoot.

30:29.773 --> 30:32.235
And this way I can walk away.

30:32.333 --> 30:33.354
Yeah, this is great.

30:33.452 --> 30:34.473
Like, "I'm tired. Going home."

30:34.571 --> 30:35.593
David: <i> You're done.</i>

30:35.594 --> 30:37.475
<i>Well, this is work, right?
It's like work, home.</i>

30:37.546 --> 30:38.919
Richard: <i> Mm-hm. Exactly.</i>

30:39.465 --> 30:41.959
Have you done stuff like this
before for anyone else?

30:42.056 --> 30:43.686
Or this sort of a unique
thing for you?

30:43.784 --> 30:45.125
Uh, unique thing.

30:45.223 --> 30:47.589
I never worked for
a tickling site before.

30:47.687 --> 30:48.677
- Okay.
- Man: No.

30:48.679 --> 30:50.597
David: <i>And what did you first
think when you got the pitch?</i>

30:50.599 --> 30:52.420
Man: <i> I mean, I laughed about it.</i>

30:52.518 --> 30:54.243
<i>I'm like,
this can't be really serious,</i>

30:54.341 --> 30:55.906
<i>like, people really can't...</i>

30:56.004 --> 30:58.626
<i>Enjoy watching this
or getting it done.</i>

30:59.235 --> 31:00.352
But, um, I said, "why not?"

31:00.450 --> 31:01.856
You know, I'm more of like
the risk-taker.

31:01.954 --> 31:04.576
I'd rather say I did something
than didn't do something.

31:04.674 --> 31:05.695
So I came down,

31:07.776 --> 31:08.846
really was kind of nervous,
didn't know what to expect.

31:08.847 --> 31:09.918
And then...
But Richard put me at ease,

31:10.015 --> 31:11.869
and once you're trapped
in you're there.

31:11.967 --> 31:14.621
So, I mean, you might
as well enjoy it.

31:14.814 --> 31:15.996
All right.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.987
- Richard: Okay, ready?
- I think you're...

31:22.397 --> 31:23.418
Man:
Take it easy on me today.

31:23.547 --> 31:24.697
Richard: Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:24.795 --> 31:25.816
Man: That's good.

31:30.841 --> 31:32.681
- Got to enjoy my freedom now.
- Richard: Yeah.

31:33.048 --> 31:35.029
- Because I cannot.
- Richard: Wave goodbye.

31:35.159 --> 31:36.692
I am not getting out.

31:37.846 --> 31:39.218
Oh, shit.

31:41.555 --> 31:44.369
The world of tickling.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.542
So, catch your breath.

31:52.784 --> 31:54.861
- Breath caught.
- Okay.

32:04.013 --> 32:06.059
All right.

32:06.157 --> 32:07.877
Now tell everybody
what a tough guy you are.

32:10.891 --> 32:16.329
Just go.

32:29.353 --> 32:30.759
Stop.

32:38.663 --> 32:40.165
Oh, my gosh.

32:40.774 --> 32:42.404
I hate this.

33:24.739 --> 33:26.273
David: <i> So when did you realize</i>

33:26.371 --> 33:31.232
<i>that you found tickling
to be an erotic thing?</i>

33:32.065 --> 33:33.471
Richard: I <i> was very young,</i>

33:33.601 --> 33:38.110
you know, probably five or six.
You know, very, very young.

33:42.399 --> 33:47.164
<i>You see something in a cartoon
or a magazine that, you know,</i>

33:47.261 --> 33:49.243
<i>kind of interests
you as a little kid,</i>

33:49.341 --> 33:51.034
<i>and for me it would be,
you know, like,</i>

33:51.132 --> 33:53.913
<i>cartoon characters being
tickled or tied up or,</i>

33:54.011 --> 33:55.257
<i>you know, that sort of thing.</i>

33:55.355 --> 33:57.913
<i>And it would, you know,
fascinate me,</i>

33:58.010 --> 34:00.216
<i>but I had no idea why.</i>

34:22.393 --> 34:24.951
Richard: How do you feel?

34:25.431 --> 34:26.900
I feel tired.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.172
- I feel sweaty.
- Can I get you some water?

34:29.270 --> 34:34.259
Yeah, water would probably work.

34:35.445 --> 34:37.715
Richard: I <i> started to become</i>
<i>comfortable with this, uh,</i>

34:37.844 --> 34:39.409
<i>fetish and this part of myself,</i>

34:39.731 --> 34:42.512
<i>and started to really realize
that it was a part of myself,</i>

34:42.610 --> 34:43.630
<i>when I...</i>

34:43.728 --> 34:45.935
When I got on AOL

34:46.447 --> 34:48.328
and then did a search
for what I was looking for

34:48.399 --> 34:49.399
and found that, "wow!"

34:50.958 --> 34:51.547
There's actually,
you know, quite a lot of

34:51.549 --> 34:52.870
"other people
that are into this."

34:59.308 --> 35:01.610
<i>At the time,
the late '90s,</i>

35:01.996 --> 35:05.161
<i>was, um, somebody that posted
on the message boards a lot.</i>

35:06.347 --> 35:09.896
<i>And she said her name was
Terri, Terri tickle.</i>

35:10.217 --> 35:14.982
<i>And Terri Disisto, she put
in what her real name was.</i>

35:16.615 --> 35:18.436
<i>She always had a picture
of herself.</i>

35:18.662 --> 35:21.829
<i>You know, a blonde,
pretty, college-aged girl.</i>

35:22.214 --> 35:25.859
<i>And, she always posted
the same verbiage.</i>

35:25.957 --> 35:27.459
<i>Something like,
"this is not porn.</i>

35:27.557 --> 35:29.315
<i>My interest is in tickling."</i>

35:30.277 --> 35:34.338
<i>And she just said that she was
a tickling fanatic and...</i>

35:34.884 --> 35:37.154
But, I mean, these posts
were everywhere.

35:40.131 --> 35:42.304
<i>And then, um, some videos
started popping up,</i>

35:42.402 --> 35:44.416
<i>you know, very,
you know, innocent.</i>

35:45.921 --> 35:48.222
<i>And, those are probably
the first</i>

35:49.599 --> 35:52.829
<i>tickle videos that I
ever saw on the Internet.</i>

35:56.957 --> 35:59.259
David: <i>There are still traces of
Terri tickle online</i>

36:00.636 --> 36:02.266
<i>from the mid-'90s,</i>

36:02.267 --> 36:03.898
<i>and as Richard said,
she was tickle-obsessed.</i>

36:03.996 --> 36:06.425
<i>Like Jane,
she also hired other people</i>

36:06.523 --> 36:08.216
<i>to shoot the videos she wanted.</i>

36:10.778 --> 36:16.023
Well, the, uh,
just strange, rich brat,

36:16.696 --> 36:18.134
I guess you could say.

36:18.936 --> 36:22.517
Someone who, uh,
got her rocks off by, uh,

36:22.614 --> 36:25.236
seeing guys, uh,
tied and tickled.

36:25.334 --> 36:28.019
Obviously an extreme dominatrix.

36:30.036 --> 36:31.282
David: <i> For most of his life,</i>

36:31.380 --> 36:33.170
<i>Dave Starr has worked
on the edges</i>

36:33.267 --> 36:35.121
<i>of the entertainment industry,</i>

36:35.411 --> 36:38.000
<i>even acting in a
couple of pornos.</i>

36:38.386 --> 36:39.599
<i>During the mid-'90s,</i>

36:39.824 --> 36:42.830
<i>he noticed Terri's online posts
wanting tickling videos...</i>

36:43.536 --> 36:44.749
<i>Lots of them.</i>

36:47.567 --> 36:52.235
Dave: <i>Terri was, uh, out there
looking for guys, uh, 18 to 23.</i>

36:53.229 --> 36:57.354
<i>And I, uh, figured
that it would, um...</i>

36:58.571 --> 37:00.744
<i>Be something
right up my alley,</i>

37:00.842 --> 37:02.322
<i>based on my, uh,
working in casting.</i>

37:06.024 --> 37:09.382
David: What sort of things was
she recruiting for specifically?

37:10.888 --> 37:14.469
Uh, tickle torture films.
Tickle torture videos.

37:15.302 --> 37:17.188
Can you turn that thing
around so I can see it?

37:17.542 --> 37:18.659
Man: All right.

37:20.933 --> 37:22.533
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, that's good.

37:25.859 --> 37:29.057
Dave: <i>She claimed it was
for a private collection,</i>

37:30.979 --> 37:33.632
<i>so I was thinking,
"okay, amateur hour."</i>

37:39.874 --> 37:44.895
<i>But me, I rapidly took it
into a professional level.</i>

37:45.633 --> 37:47.934
Man 1:
<i>Okay, are you, uh, ticklish?</i>

37:48.288 --> 37:49.534
Man 2: <i> Uh, yes, I am.</i>

37:49.888 --> 37:51.934
Man 1: Okay,
step forward about a foot.

37:52.255 --> 37:55.708
Okay. Place your hands behind
your head, inter-clasp them.

37:55.806 --> 37:57.660
Step back a little further,
though.

37:57.758 --> 37:59.035
Okay, right about there.

37:59.133 --> 38:00.346
Okay, inter-clasp them

38:00.444 --> 38:02.490
and do not release them
at any time

38:02.588 --> 38:03.929
during the entire tickle test.

38:04.027 --> 38:05.433
Do your worst on this one.

38:05.883 --> 38:07.096
Dave: <i>We would put them
in through</i>

38:07.194 --> 38:09.112
<i>their stage one audition,</i>

38:09.210 --> 38:12.535
<i>which is the questions
and the test tickles.</i>

38:13.528 --> 38:16.246
Man 1: Do not collapse.
Stay looking up at us.

38:21.846 --> 38:23.252
Stay facing us.

38:30.068 --> 38:36.689
Dave: <i>Stage two is tying them to
the table, tickling them,</i>

38:36.787 --> 38:38.705
flipping them over
every 15 minutes,

38:38.803 --> 38:42.065
kind of like a sausage or meat.

38:45.681 --> 38:47.087
Dave: <i> And then after that, uh,</i>

38:47.185 --> 38:50.766
we had the competitive tickling
at that point.

38:50.864 --> 38:53.901
Tickle wars and stuff like that.

38:53.999 --> 38:57.996
And that would involve
a massive production.

39:11.692 --> 39:13.130
Woman: <i> Okay, don't laugh.</i>

39:13.580 --> 39:15.561
<i>You're giggling already,
aren't you?</i>

39:17.386 --> 39:19.496
<i>Well, you just might be
the type of person</i>

39:19.594 --> 39:21.479
<i>that David Starr
is looking for.</i>

39:21.577 --> 39:22.790
<i>He is a Hollywood producer</i>

39:22.888 --> 39:25.286
<i>working on a new
reality-based game show</i>

39:25.383 --> 39:27.589
<i>called</i> tickle talk.

39:27.943 --> 39:31.973
Dave:

39:37.862 --> 39:39.011
Woman: <i>It might be
preferable to</i>

39:39.109 --> 39:41.155
<i>eating rats or grubs</i>
<i>on</i> survivor

39:41.253 --> 39:42.915
<i>but just barely.</i>

39:43.013 --> 39:46.146
<i>I'm Anne James,</i>
KSEN k96 news.

39:46.244 --> 39:48.993
David: <i>Dave Starr had steady
work for five years,</i>

39:49.091 --> 39:52.192
<i>even when Terri was
hospitalized for six months.</i>

39:52.769 --> 39:53.982
<i>During that time,</i>

39:54.080 --> 39:55.645
<i>she just wrote
letters specifying</i>

39:55.743 --> 39:58.524
<i>exactly what she wanted
in the tickling videos.</i>

39:58.622 --> 40:00.699
Terri:
<i>"David, merry Christmas!</i>

40:00.797 --> 40:02.939
<i>So sorry,
I'm in the hospital with mono."</i>

40:03.036 --> 40:05.786
<i>"David, just a few things
I need you to do..."</i>

40:05.884 --> 40:08.346
<i>"Tell them I will send the
computer as soon as I'm well."</i>

40:08.443 --> 40:10.683
<i>"His name is Josh." "I hope
to be online again in Feb."</i>

40:10.714 --> 40:13.751
<i>"I'm still sick in bed."
"That's all for now. Td."</i>

40:16.953 --> 40:19.255
My most ticklish place is,
I guess...

40:20.217 --> 40:24.438
Definitely, like...
It'd have to be in my legs...

40:25.207 --> 40:28.373
More than, like, my armpits
or my feet, I think, but...

40:28.630 --> 40:31.092
Dave: <i>At that time
she wanted to put up</i>

40:31.190 --> 40:34.387
and did indeed put up
a website for a while, uh,

40:34.485 --> 40:38.098
unauthorized releasing
of the videos...

40:39.252 --> 40:41.105
Against the
agreement of the talent,

40:41.683 --> 40:43.024
and I flipped my lid.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.104
And, lo and behold,

40:45.202 --> 40:48.783
she goes and registers domains
in their names

40:49.392 --> 40:50.989
and then proceeds to...

40:51.758 --> 40:55.660
Release all their content on
to those particular websites.

41:02.860 --> 41:08.490
Alden: <i>She was, like,
sending me emails about, um,</i>

41:08.588 --> 41:09.828
<i>"what do you think
your mother's</i>

41:09.867 --> 41:11.496
<i>gonna think about this?"</i>

41:11.946 --> 41:15.656
<i>And then, like, I'd be like,
you know, "fuck you, bitch."</i>

41:15.754 --> 41:20.135
<i>And she'd be, like...
Like, totally antagonizing.</i>

41:20.232 --> 41:24.774
<i>Like...
I mean, she was such a cunt.</i>

41:29.255 --> 41:32.965
It was an assault not just on
me but on my family, you know?

41:33.990 --> 41:36.643
I mean, I couldn't have a more
conservative family, you know?

41:36.838 --> 41:40.388
I'm, I'm in a family full of
republican, military people,

41:40.485 --> 41:43.779
and I'm a...
I was a professional banker.

41:43.877 --> 41:48.130
And here I am, like,
with basically a porn site,

41:48.228 --> 41:51.233
where I'm not naked, but,
I mean, I might as well be.

41:51.331 --> 41:54.209
You know, this was
ruining my life at the time.

41:54.307 --> 41:55.424
That's how I felt.

41:55.650 --> 41:58.687
It certainly was affecting my
ability to function,

41:58.785 --> 42:04.126
because it was
so emotionally draining.

42:04.287 --> 42:09.307
Part of the reason was because
there's nobody to help me.

42:10.621 --> 42:14.587
It's like you lose control over,
you know, your life.

42:21.660 --> 42:25.241
Dave: <i>Well, that's when the,
uh, crap started happening,</i>

42:25.402 --> 42:26.615
<i>uh, with me.</i>

42:27.673 --> 42:30.743
<i>Um, you decide,
"okay, because I, uh,</i>"

42:30.841 --> 42:33.719
<i>I closed down
submissions for her,</i>

42:33.817 --> 42:34.838
<i>and,</i>

42:34.840 --> 42:39.222
I guess, I basically was like
her tickling drug dealer,

42:39.576 --> 42:42.837
and, uh, since she wasn't
getting her drug any more,

42:42.935 --> 42:45.460
she was going through
tickle withdrawals.

42:47.222 --> 42:49.012
David: And what happened?

42:49.813 --> 42:53.139
I started, uh,
receiving the, uh,

42:53.237 --> 42:57.074
strange postcards,
and the, uh, strange messages.

42:57.876 --> 43:01.841
The, uh... the, uh, talent was
starting to receive messages.

43:02.354 --> 43:06.799
And, uh, she also deployed a
thing called the phone blaster,

43:06.897 --> 43:13.134
which was to call
everybody with obscene messages.

43:14.064 --> 43:17.677
Woman:

43:46.351 --> 43:48.395
<i>This person's on drugs.</i>

43:50.253 --> 43:54.027
This person's gotta be
on crystal or something,

43:54.668 --> 43:57.802
or taking cocaine up the ass,
or something like that.

43:58.571 --> 43:59.913
It was weird.

44:02.346 --> 44:05.127
I'm glad to be able to make
this available to you.

44:05.225 --> 44:07.750
David: <i>David kept a number of
letters Terri had sent him</i>

44:07.848 --> 44:10.757
<i>and was keen to show me
the extent of the abuse.</i>

44:11.526 --> 44:15.907
- All right.
- This is the magic stuff.

44:16.997 --> 44:18.339
All right, what have we got?

44:22.371 --> 44:24.993
Yeah. Uh,
these are basically copies

44:25.091 --> 44:27.745
of what she would post online.

44:28.195 --> 44:29.857
So who's Barbara?
Is that your...?

44:29.954 --> 44:31.200
That's my mother.

44:31.873 --> 44:33.663
David: "Hairy and horny.
Hairy and horny."

44:33.761 --> 44:35.775
Jewish tickle filmer
David W. Starr

44:35.873 --> 44:37.279
"is hook-nosed,
hairy and horny."

44:37.376 --> 44:42.589
She's used that tagline
for many, many, many times.

44:42.688 --> 44:43.773
What did your...?

44:44.127 --> 44:45.789
What did your mother
think of this stuff

44:45.887 --> 44:47.772
when this turned up? I mean...

44:47.870 --> 44:49.756
Actually, her phrase was, uh...

44:49.854 --> 44:52.732
Here's a, uh, note that she left
me because, uh,

44:52.829 --> 44:54.715
she would hold these for me
in the mail

44:54.813 --> 44:57.818
and basically just say,
"here's another nasty thing."

44:57.916 --> 45:00.218
And that one actually
is unopened.

45:00.316 --> 45:02.874
I've never even opened
it to this date.

45:04.347 --> 45:08.888
And let's see what our little
illustrious friend had to say.

45:09.369 --> 45:11.415
Oh, god. So it's a card.

45:13.112 --> 45:16.086
David: "Roses are red,
violets are bue."

45:16.184 --> 45:17.782
Can't spell worth shit.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.502
"David W. Starr has
brought this upon you."

45:20.599 --> 45:23.445
Perhaps you wish,
perhaps instead,

45:23.543 --> 45:25.909
"that David your failure,
not Edward, were dead."

45:26.007 --> 45:28.532
That's a reference to
my brother, who is dead.

45:29.685 --> 45:33.043
That's, uh, really extreme.
A little bit psycho.

45:33.524 --> 45:35.602
But, I mean, what...? When you
were getting all this material

45:35.700 --> 45:38.289
and some of it's talking about
your brother who

45:38.387 --> 45:39.728
- has passed away and...
- Uh-huh.

45:39.826 --> 45:41.008
Writing this stuff
to your mother,

45:41.106 --> 45:43.695
I mean, that,
that must have...

45:45.105 --> 45:48.238
I mean, that... that's not nice
receiving that on weekly basis.

45:48.336 --> 45:52.301
Uh, no, but it was on a
weekly basis, uh, yeah.

45:54.318 --> 45:56.075
Yeah, where did
they have the time?

45:58.252 --> 46:00.170
- Jeez, it's a birthday card.
- Yeah.

46:00.268 --> 46:01.578
"Happy birthday.

46:02.156 --> 46:06.728
Edward Starr dead."
This is really cruel, right?

46:06.826 --> 46:08.072
It's very sick.

46:12.169 --> 46:14.439
David: <i>The more I hear
about Terri Disisto,</i>

46:14.537 --> 46:16.870
<i>the more she sounds
like Jane O’Brien.</i>

46:17.224 --> 46:20.869
<i>To state the obvious, they
both really enjoy tickling.</i>

46:20.967 --> 46:23.813
<i>They also like being in
control and lashing out.</i>

46:23.910 --> 46:25.572
I really appreciate it
and stay in touch.

46:28.005 --> 46:30.050
David: <i>And it turns out
Terri's habits started</i>

46:30.148 --> 46:32.385
<i>way before Dave Starr
got involved.</i>

46:32.803 --> 46:35.040
<i>I've found a journalist who'd
spent a year uncovering</i>

46:35.138 --> 46:38.591
<i>the truth about Terri Disisto
during the '90s.</i>

46:40.129 --> 46:42.751
Hal: <i>Terri Disisto's mo
was to bait these boys</i>

46:42.849 --> 46:44.767
<i>into making
tickling videos with</i>

46:44.865 --> 46:46.718
<i>things that they wanted, right?</i>

46:47.488 --> 46:49.181
You know, I mean,
imagine being a teenage boy,

46:49.279 --> 46:52.157
and, like, you get this random
email saying, you know,

46:52.255 --> 46:54.940
"I saw your posting about the
phish concert, and, uh,

46:55.038 --> 46:56.315
how would you like to go?"

46:56.413 --> 46:58.779
Or, " I can send you
$1000 cash."

46:58.877 --> 47:00.283
And you're like...
You're living in your dorm

47:00.381 --> 47:03.066
at James Madison university.
You're like, "yeah, sure."

47:03.164 --> 47:06.233
You're gonna send me
$1000 cash. Right."

47:07.195 --> 47:09.624
<i>Fedex pulls up in front of your
dorm the next day,</i>

47:09.722 --> 47:12.503
<i>and there is ten $100 bills.</i>

47:12.857 --> 47:14.134
<i>You haven't done anything.</i>

47:16.152 --> 47:18.518
<i>She would just keep sending
them whatever they wanted,</i>

47:18.616 --> 47:21.718
<i>you know. Computers,
cameras, more cash,</i>

47:21.975 --> 47:23.956
<i>tickets to rock concerts.</i>

47:25.397 --> 47:28.275
<i>Then at some point,
even a teenage boy</i>

47:28.373 --> 47:30.451
<i>has all the toys
that they want.</i>

47:31.316 --> 47:33.426
<i>And they say, "I... I'm done."</i>

47:34.771 --> 47:39.376
<i>But I think the thing that
she hates the most was no.</i>

47:39.633 --> 47:43.534
It was like...
A bomb went off.

47:46.063 --> 47:47.469
<i>"And she'd say, " well,</i>

47:47.598 --> 47:51.308
<i>if you don't do it,
I'm gonna make your life hell."</i>

47:52.749 --> 47:54.667
<i>"I'm gonna send clips
of these videos</i>

47:54.765 --> 47:56.171
<i>to your wrestling coach."</i>

47:56.780 --> 47:59.082
<i>"I'm gonna send clips of
these videos to your mom."</i>

47:59.180 --> 48:01.641
<i>"I'm gonna send clips of these
videos to your grandmother."</i>

48:01.739 --> 48:03.260
<i>"I'm gonna send
clips of these videos</i>

48:03.306 --> 48:05.384
<i>to the president
of your university."</i>

48:05.481 --> 48:06.919
<i>"I'm gonna post them
all over the Internet."</i>

48:07.144 --> 48:09.702
"I'm gonna pretend to be you
and do things on the Internet

48:09.800 --> 48:12.262
that are gonna create a terrible
reputation for you."

48:12.360 --> 48:16.676
"I'm gonna shut down the entire
college campus computer system

48:16.774 --> 48:19.651
at your college, and they're
gonna think it's you."

48:21.893 --> 48:23.107
And then it happened.

48:37.124 --> 48:39.394
Debbie: <i>The first story I did
was because</i>

48:39.811 --> 48:43.329
<i>she was attacking, um,
Drexel university.</i>

48:45.122 --> 48:49.088
And I found the student who, um,

48:49.826 --> 48:51.647
had made a number
of videos for her.

48:55.040 --> 48:58.173
<i>And when he came to
Philadelphia to go to college,</i>

48:58.430 --> 49:00.667
<i>she wanted him to
continue making these videos,</i>

49:00.765 --> 49:03.931
<i>and he wanted to cut off his
relationship with her.</i>

49:04.125 --> 49:06.842
<i>And she retaliated
on so many levels.</i>

49:08.604 --> 49:10.297
<i>Their email servers' computers
were being shut down</i>

49:10.395 --> 49:12.280
<i>with these
denial-of-service attacks</i>

49:12.378 --> 49:14.968
<i>that indicated that they
were coming from him.</i>

49:18.202 --> 49:19.960
<i>Email-bombing the white house,</i>

49:20.313 --> 49:22.263
<i>indicating that
it came from him.</i>

49:23.480 --> 49:26.005
<i>Yeah, that's pretty serious
stuff when the secret service</i>

49:26.103 --> 49:29.365
<i>shows up in your college dorm
and you're 19 years old.</i>

49:35.733 --> 49:38.482
<i>I was just curious,
and I somehow</i>

49:38.580 --> 49:42.257
<i>started contacting
Terri on AOL.</i>

49:42.259 --> 49:43.472
<i>She had an account.</i>

49:45.778 --> 49:48.271
<i>And we would have these
chats late at night.</i>

49:49.136 --> 49:53.325
<i>And I was curious what kind of
mind was behind this...</i>

49:53.967 --> 49:56.109
<i>Celebrated Internet personage.</i>

49:57.134 --> 49:59.883
<i>And it was,
it was kind of crazy.</i>

49:59.981 --> 50:01.611
<i>We would have
these conversations,</i>

50:03.532 --> 50:04.298
and she would...

50:04.299 --> 50:05.065
When she realized
that I did wine, she would say,

50:05.163 --> 50:08.104
"oh, I'm having a
glass of chardonnay!"

50:08.202 --> 50:12.039
And I could just hear this
voice because as it went on,

50:12.137 --> 50:15.111
it was almost like she was
completely intoxicated

50:15.336 --> 50:18.886
with this power
that she had to...

50:19.463 --> 50:21.381
To be so destructive
against people.

50:31.718 --> 50:35.619
Hal: I <i> got word about a kid</i>
<i>who refused to make the videos.</i>

50:37.221 --> 50:39.683
<i>He posted that
he needed some help,</i>

50:39.780 --> 50:41.922
<i>and somebody said
they would help him.</i>

50:45.444 --> 50:47.714
<i>And somehow he got
emailed a file,</i>

50:48.995 --> 50:52.832
<i>"and he was told, " if you email
this zip file to Terri,</i>

50:52.930 --> 50:54.495
<i>she will leave you alone."</i>

50:58.112 --> 50:59.902
And then he sent me
that zip file.

51:05.375 --> 51:07.836
<i>You know, and I remember
opening it up and thinking...</i>

51:09.309 --> 51:12.635
"Wow! You know, this is it.
Like, this is...

51:13.052 --> 51:14.746
This is the smoking gun."

51:21.690 --> 51:25.016
David: <i>The zip file contained
documents from her hard drive.</i>

51:25.114 --> 51:28.727
<i>As expected, there were files
relating to tickling shoots.</i>

51:31.193 --> 51:36.087
<i>But they also revealed the
true identity of Terri tickle.</i>

51:48.440 --> 51:49.782
Hal: <i> David D'Amato.</i>

51:51.479 --> 51:55.029
<i>She is really he, right?</i>

52:05.077 --> 52:08.018
Debbie: <i>He was an assistant
principal in a high school?</i>

52:10.836 --> 52:12.049
<i>I just...</i>

52:15.058 --> 52:18.320
Couldn't believe it.

52:18.418 --> 52:20.943
I don't know why,
but it just seemed...

52:21.041 --> 52:24.686
Here is this sadistic person
exploiting these young people,

52:25.199 --> 52:26.797
often underage,

52:28.622 --> 52:31.691
making their lives miserable,
embarrassing them,

52:32.397 --> 52:34.411
to an extent that it's every...

52:34.508 --> 52:38.154
It goes against everything that
an educator should be doing.

52:45.387 --> 52:47.849
Hal: <i>When I did some more
checking, I found out that</i>

52:47.947 --> 52:51.016
<i>he had worked at, like,
eight schools in ten years.</i>

52:52.458 --> 52:54.056
Which to me was
always a red flag

52:54.153 --> 52:55.559
that there was something
else going on.

52:55.657 --> 52:58.407
I mean, that's more than
just sheer incompetence.

53:00.936 --> 53:04.614
<i>And then I found
social security numbers for her</i>

53:04.712 --> 53:06.757
<i>that he had
gotten fraudulently...</i>

53:07.495 --> 53:09.413
<i>With dead people's names.</i>

53:13.893 --> 53:18.115
<i>So I contacted the FBI.</i>

53:19.429 --> 53:22.114
<i>I turned over all my
information to them.</i>

53:23.620 --> 53:26.913
Within a week, they busted him.

53:39.267 --> 53:41.185
Debbie: <i>We were shocked
at the sentencing</i>

53:41.378 --> 53:43.968
<i>because he got off so easy.</i>

53:44.066 --> 53:46.591
<i>For somebody who had done so
much damage,</i>

53:47.808 --> 53:49.597
to me it was just extraordinary.

53:50.303 --> 53:52.765
And to not, to not have
restrictions on their

53:52.863 --> 53:56.796
Internet access after that,
how could...?

53:57.373 --> 54:00.123
And the... oh! And the idea that
he was going to law school

54:00.221 --> 54:01.754
was just absurd.

54:04.156 --> 54:07.001
David: <i>It turns out
David D'Amato's father, George,</i>

54:07.099 --> 54:09.721
<i>co-founded one of wall street's
biggest law firms,</i>

54:09.819 --> 54:13.912
<i>D'Amato & Lynch, and David
got a really great lawyer.</i>

54:14.393 --> 54:17.239
<i>Instead of prison, D'Amato was
allowed to serve his sentence</i>

54:17.337 --> 54:19.255
<i>in the halfway house
while he studied law</i>

54:19.353 --> 54:22.774
<i>at his father's Alma mater,
Fordham university.</i>

54:25.271 --> 54:27.829
Hal: <i>The judge,
for some reason,</i>

54:27.926 --> 54:31.188
<i>decided that he would endorse
the law school path, right?</i>

54:32.053 --> 54:33.491
<i>Because, like, this is exactly
the kind of person</i>

54:33.589 --> 54:35.251
<i>that should be a lawyer, right?</i>

54:35.348 --> 54:38.450
Somebody who has
defrauded people,

54:38.548 --> 54:40.433
somebody who has
stolen people's identities.

54:40.531 --> 54:42.096
A federal freakin' crime, right?

54:42.194 --> 54:45.296
I mean... like,
you know, stolen identity.

54:45.393 --> 54:47.407
Stolen a social security number
of a dead woman,

54:47.505 --> 54:49.391
of two dead people, right?

54:51.824 --> 54:55.405
<i>"It said, " David D'Amato,
39, of garden city,</i>

54:55.951 --> 54:58.221
<i>plead guilty

54:58.318 --> 54:59.660
<i>"computer fraud and abuse."</i>

55:02.830 --> 55:04.940
<i>Nothing about the tickling,</i>

55:05.037 --> 55:08.747
<i>nothing about the boys, nothing
about the identity theft.</i>

55:08.876 --> 55:10.602
Zero. Nothing.

55:11.564 --> 55:14.378
David: <i>Once Fordham became
aware of D'Amato's convictions,</i>

55:14.475 --> 55:16.361
<i>his admission was revoked.</i>

55:16.459 --> 55:17.961
<i>No longer able to study law,</i>

55:18.058 --> 55:20.488
<i>D'Amato finished
his sentence in prison.</i>

55:20.873 --> 55:23.847
<i>But I've realized that
didn't stop the tickling.</i>

55:24.872 --> 55:27.302
David: So, this is 2002. So this
is writing to David Starr,

55:27.399 --> 55:29.445
who would shoot
these boys tickling

55:29.543 --> 55:31.205
and then send the videos...

55:32.454 --> 55:33.540
To Terri. That was a, that's...

55:33.638 --> 55:36.100
Because she,
what she would have is...

55:36.902 --> 55:38.691
- Do you want your glasses?
- Back in the early days...

55:38.789 --> 55:40.674
Yeah. Back in the early days...

55:42.469 --> 55:48.226
Terri would have friends
tickle them and send them the...

55:48.516 --> 55:50.434
They were amateur tapes.

55:50.531 --> 55:52.769
- These are now professional?
- Well, this is...

55:52.834 --> 55:54.336
- Look at the date on it.
- '02?

55:54.434 --> 55:55.584
Look at the date.

55:56.513 --> 55:59.550
- Is the "t" Terri?
- Yeah, it's Terri writing.

55:59.648 --> 56:03.645
So that was during, um,
lock-up time.

56:03.743 --> 56:06.428
Oh, in jail. I get it.

56:06.526 --> 56:11.548
"David, a few other things.
Email... explain my illness."

56:11.646 --> 56:13.660
Oh. "Tell him I'll pay
everything owed"

56:13.757 --> 56:16.571
as soon as the mono is better."

56:16.669 --> 56:22.010
Oh. "Get headshots."
My god! Oh, my god!

56:23.356 --> 56:29.081
"I won't be online for a while
as I am very sick." Oh.

56:34.938 --> 56:39.383
- Couldn't stop.
- No. No.

56:41.241 --> 56:43.542
David: <i>It seems that
since the mid-'90s,</i>

56:43.640 --> 56:46.454
<i>David D'Amato has never
stopped finding elaborate ways</i>

56:46.552 --> 56:48.981
<i>to get young men
to tickle each other.</i>

56:49.494 --> 56:50.996
<i>His persona of Terri tickle</i>

56:51.094 --> 56:54.483
<i>seems to have dropped off the
radar around 2006.</i>

56:55.221 --> 56:58.930
<i>A while later, Jane O’Brien
arrived on the scene.</i>

57:02.579 --> 57:04.401
<i>We've posted
this theory online,</i>

57:04.498 --> 57:07.151
<i>and David D'Amato is not happy.</i>

57:08.849 --> 57:12.366
<i>He's hired not one, but two
private investigators,</i>

57:12.464 --> 57:15.085
<i>one in New Zealand
and one in New York.</i>

57:16.687 --> 57:20.236
<i>The message is clear. They tell
us to stop what we're doing</i>

57:20.334 --> 57:23.883
<i>and that D'Amato has nothing
to do with Jane O’Brien media.</i>

57:26.764 --> 57:28.426
On top of that,

57:28.427 --> 57:30.089
<i>David D'Amato has also hired
a New Zealand lawyer.</i>

57:30.380 --> 57:32.809
<i>He's demanding
an apology and retraction</i>

57:32.907 --> 57:35.785
<i>or else he'll see us
in a New Zealand court.</i>

57:44.650 --> 57:45.767
<i>We're now being attacked</i>

57:45.865 --> 57:48.102
<i>by Jane O'brien's lawyers
on one side</i>

57:48.200 --> 57:50.437
<i>and David D'Amato's
on the other,</i>

57:50.919 --> 57:54.563
<i>both insisting they have
nothing to do with each other.</i>

57:54.917 --> 57:57.635
<i>Once again, we're way
out of our depth.</i>

58:00.644 --> 58:02.178
<i>Things get even more surreal</i>

58:02.243 --> 58:04.097
<i>with a phone call
from Michigan,</i>

58:04.195 --> 58:06.465
<i>where there's a very different
tickling operation</i>

58:06.563 --> 58:08.321
<i>also being run by Jane.</i>

58:11.458 --> 58:15.199
Jordan:

58:54.048 --> 58:56.253
David: <i>So, like,
crime is pretty high...</i>

58:56.414 --> 58:57.980
- Jordan: <i>Yeah...
- ...Here, right?</i>

58:58.077 --> 59:02.714
<i>Murder, robberies, um, rape,
I mean, theft.</i>

59:02.812 --> 59:04.506
It's all up there,

59:04.604 --> 59:07.770
especially for being as small,
um, as what it is.

59:07.867 --> 59:09.689
We've made it now, uh,

59:09.786 --> 59:13.975
on to the top 100 most dangerous
cities in the United States.

59:14.649 --> 59:16.311
David:
<i>Do you think on some level</i>

59:16.409 --> 59:19.542
<i>Jane kind of directed things
here because it is a poor area?</i>

59:19.640 --> 59:23.093
Yeah, you know,
the poverty level, you know,

59:23.191 --> 59:24.693
- is easy to target, you know.
- Mm.

59:24.791 --> 59:27.124
Thousands of dollars
in kids' hands is...

59:27.222 --> 59:29.043
That's a,
that's a big, big deal.

01:00:13.935 --> 01:00:19.436
David: <i> Jane has taken a liking to one of
muskegon's main sports, mixed martial arts.</i>

01:00:19.534 --> 01:00:23.531
<i>A group of young, athletic men
desperate for extra money.</i>

01:00:44.268 --> 01:00:47.209
Jordan: <i> That's what she was trying
to do, is break into the MMA world.</i>

01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:50.601
<i>Because it's not illegal
to tickle somebody</i>

01:00:50.698 --> 01:00:53.512
<i>to get out of a submission
in mixed martial arts.</i>

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.687
<i>Like, she was trying
to pitch that</i>

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:56.646
<i>because she, like,</i>

01:00:56.648 --> 01:00:59.270
<i>looked it up in all the rules
and everything.</i>

01:01:00.168 --> 01:01:03.526
But if you tickle a guy in the
middle of that ring

01:01:03.623 --> 01:01:05.157
to get out of a submission,

01:01:05.255 --> 01:01:07.748
you might step out of the cage
and get punched in the face.

01:01:08.454 --> 01:01:12.868
Like, never in a million years
out of all my fights

01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:15.554
would I ever try to
tickle somebody

01:01:15.652 --> 01:01:18.945
to get out of a submission.
Fuck, no!

01:01:35.518 --> 01:01:36.924
David: <i> As an ex-fighter,</i>

01:01:37.022 --> 01:01:40.348
<i>Jordan was paid to recruit
tickling talent in the town.</i>

01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:44.123
<i>He's the only one in muskegon
prepared to appear on camera.</i>

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:51.321
<i>She offered my one buddy a
2014 Chevy cruze and $30,000.</i>

01:01:51.739 --> 01:01:53.816
- What? What for? To tickle?
- Yeah.

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:57.143
Just 'cause, like,
she liked him.

01:01:57.241 --> 01:01:58.358
Yeah, right. She...
He was a favorite.

01:01:58.519 --> 01:01:59.829
- Like, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:01:59.927 --> 01:02:02.260
Asians and redheads
are what they call premiums.

01:02:02.358 --> 01:02:04.660
If you get those, like,
she gives you bonuses.

01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:07.154
I'm Jordan Schillaci,
and this is cet.

01:02:07.252 --> 01:02:09.329
Uh, we're gonna be
having a discussion,

01:02:09.427 --> 01:02:12.049
more of a debate today about
whether tickling

01:02:12.147 --> 01:02:15.153
is effective in
a combat situation.

01:02:19.314 --> 01:02:21.075
<i>We ended up setting up
a tickle cell. Like,</i>

01:02:21.265 --> 01:02:22.466
<i>where you get guys to come in,</i>

01:02:22.513 --> 01:02:25.071
<i>"we'll pay you and you
pay them to audition."</i>

01:02:25.169 --> 01:02:27.886
No!

01:02:30.319 --> 01:02:32.781
<i>So we'd choose a hotel,
nothing fancy,</i>

01:02:32.878 --> 01:02:36.748
<i>and, uh, the guys would come
in and hang out, you know,</i>

01:02:36.846 --> 01:02:40.971
<i>smoke, drink, eat pizza,
fuckin', and we'd hurry up</i>

01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:44.330
<i>and run through, you know,
five, six, seven guys.</i>

01:02:49.323 --> 01:02:52.041
So you're... you were looking after
the tickle cell in muskegon?

01:02:52.139 --> 01:02:54.216
Yeah, they have them set up
all over the us.

01:02:54.314 --> 01:02:57.928
Ohio, Michigan,
Florida, New York.

01:02:58.025 --> 01:02:59.815
- I mean, they're everywhere.
- Right.

01:02:59.944 --> 01:03:01.863
- And they're all for Jane?
- Yeah.

01:03:02.376 --> 01:03:03.686
Fuckin' hell.

01:03:09.478 --> 01:03:10.884
Jordan: <i>Well, that's where
a lot of people started</i>

01:03:10.982 --> 01:03:12.611
<i>getting really
really upset, man.</i>

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:13.891
<i>Because all of sudden
these videos</i>

01:03:13.893 --> 01:03:15.970
<i>that are supposed to be
just auditions were on YouTube,</i>

01:03:15.972 --> 01:03:18.850
<i>vimeo, and every other
site you could imagine.</i>

01:03:18.948 --> 01:03:21.153
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Nobody was okay with that.</i>

01:03:23.427 --> 01:03:24.992
<i>One of the guys, Brodie,</i>

01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:28.127
<i>like, his family was very upset
with him. It was all over.</i>

01:03:28.225 --> 01:03:30.782
<i>Like, people just picked on him
and picked on him.</i>

01:03:31.488 --> 01:03:34.302
<i>You know, he was underage,
still in school.</i>

01:03:34.592 --> 01:03:36.765
And it wasn't supposed
to go out on the Internet.

01:03:36.863 --> 01:03:39.420
It wasn't supposed to be put up,
and, uh,

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:43.099
you know,
that just kind of sucked.

01:03:43.197 --> 01:03:45.243
Because, like I said,
it took Brodie...

01:03:45.341 --> 01:03:46.618
It hit one of the hardest.

01:03:46.716 --> 01:03:48.185
Like, this whole situation

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.585
and then being underage
and his parents.

01:03:50.682 --> 01:03:52.728
Who do you have to turn to?
Who are you going to attack?

01:03:52.826 --> 01:03:56.119
No... Jane O'brien's a ghost.
Nobody knows who it is.

01:03:58.233 --> 01:03:59.767
Jordan: <i> Cody-bear, no.</i>

01:04:00.696 --> 01:04:03.125
This is Colton,
this is my nephew.

01:04:03.223 --> 01:04:04.984
- David: Hey, man.
- Colton, how old are you?

01:04:05.878 --> 01:04:07.124
How old are you?

01:04:07.318 --> 01:04:08.531
- Three.
- You're three?

01:04:08.629 --> 01:04:10.098
You're three? All right.

01:04:10.867 --> 01:04:12.849
- I'm David.
- I'm Phil. How are you doing?

01:04:12.947 --> 01:04:14.160
It's nice to meet you, sir.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.518
I was really, really reluctant

01:04:17.616 --> 01:04:19.136
when Jordan
started talking about this.

01:04:19.215 --> 01:04:22.189
And he's like, "this lady seems
straight and legit, mom."

01:04:22.287 --> 01:04:25.452
I'm like, you know,
"these... these boys are young."

01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:28.844
It's easy to believe,
but when you're an old mom,

01:04:29.261 --> 01:04:31.914
you're a little more leery
for the boys, and,

01:04:32.044 --> 01:04:34.922
I was very leery
right from get-go

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.001
that the boys were
gonna get into trouble

01:04:37.099 --> 01:04:38.824
and this was not legit.

01:04:48.745 --> 01:04:50.566
Jordan: <i>She has all the money in
the world, it seems like,</i>

01:04:50.664 --> 01:04:52.805
<i>whoever it is,
to be able to do this.</i>

01:04:52.903 --> 01:04:56.068
<i>But they're waiting for
that day that you rely</i>

01:04:56.805 --> 01:04:58.883
<i>on that as a sole income.</i>

01:04:59.204 --> 01:05:01.154
<i>That was her big,
I think, power trip.</i>

01:05:01.252 --> 01:05:04.737
<i>She waited until a bunch of
us relied on that income</i>

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:07.264
because that was our
only source of income.

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.024
We'd been doing it for so long,
we didn't think...

01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:11.615
She waited until she had
complete control,

01:05:11.713 --> 01:05:13.983
basically, over your situation,

01:05:14.337 --> 01:05:15.774
and that's when she
wanted to yank that rug

01:05:15.872 --> 01:05:17.341
right out from under you.

01:05:22.015 --> 01:05:25.052
David: David D'Amato. Have you
heard that name before?

01:05:25.565 --> 01:05:27.130
In relation to all this stuff?

01:05:28.764 --> 01:05:31.545
I am literally, like,
trembling right now.

01:05:31.643 --> 01:05:32.697
Are you actually shaking?

01:05:32.698 --> 01:05:36.632
Yeah, I'm actually, like,
shaking. Like, I'm not, like...

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:39.544
Like I said, like, from being
from here, I don't take shit.

01:05:39.642 --> 01:05:42.616
Like, if I met up with that guy,
I'd punch him right out.

01:05:42.714 --> 01:05:44.824
And when he woke up, he'd be
strapped to a chair with a...

01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:45.943
Like, I'd be like,

01:05:46.104 --> 01:05:47.944
"dude, you're telling me
everything right now."

01:05:54.391 --> 01:05:56.628
David: <i>The tickling's still
happening in this town.</i>

01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:59.124
Jordan: <i> The money is endless.</i>

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:02.259
<i>I've never seen it stop coming
and just flowing in.</i>

01:06:02.357 --> 01:06:04.077
<i>And it's not just through
Michigan and la,</i>

01:06:04.117 --> 01:06:05.202
<i>it's everywhere.</i>

01:06:05.844 --> 01:06:09.618
<i>Like, England,
Australia, Italy.</i>

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:12.529
<i>I mean, the money's
still coming and going.</i>

01:06:16.786 --> 01:06:18.097
David: <i> This tickling empire</i>

01:06:18.194 --> 01:06:20.495
<i>is way bigger
than we ever imagined.</i>

01:06:22.384 --> 01:06:25.326
<i>We're going to New York
to find David D'Amato.</i>

01:07:01.197 --> 01:07:04.971
I can feel the rich/bad aura.

01:07:07.468 --> 01:07:10.282
<i>David D'Amato's address is
listed in garden city,</i>

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.680
<i>an affluent suburb
of long island.</i>

01:07:15.178 --> 01:07:17.639
<i>He lives on the top floor
of this building.</i>

01:07:19.113 --> 01:07:20.273
Lance:
<i>Lance Roberts speaking.</i>

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:21.925
David:
<i>Oh, hi. It's David speaking.</i>

01:07:22.023 --> 01:07:24.548
<i>I just wanted to talk to
David D'Amato.</i>

01:07:24.902 --> 01:07:27.556
Lance: <i>Um, okay. I can't
give you his phone number.</i>

01:07:27.685 --> 01:07:28.803
<i>I really can't even
give you any</i>

01:07:28.901 --> 01:07:30.530
<i>personal information on him.</i>

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:31.968
David: <i> Okay.</i>

01:07:32.386 --> 01:07:33.631
Lance: <i> Do you know him?</i>

01:07:33.729 --> 01:07:36.319
<i>- Yes, I do. Yes.
- You're a friend of his?</i>

01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:39.006
<i>Um, I'm not a friend, no,
but I've, um...</i>

01:07:39.104 --> 01:07:40.541
<i>I've been trying to get
in touch with him</i>

01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:41.949
<i>but have been struggling.</i>

01:07:42.718 --> 01:07:43.759
Lance: <i> Okay, what I do is,</i>

01:07:43.838 --> 01:07:45.595
<i>I have a way of leaving him
a message.</i>

01:07:46.493 --> 01:07:48.635
<i>I can't guarantee that
he's gonna call you back</i>

01:07:48.733 --> 01:07:49.786
<i>if he doesn't know you.</i>

01:07:49.788 --> 01:07:52.538
<i>- Okay, thank you so much. Bye.
- You're welcome.</i>

01:07:59.673 --> 01:08:01.558
David:
<i>D'Amato never calls us back,</i>

01:08:01.657 --> 01:08:04.662
<i>and we've got no other way to
contact him directly.</i>

01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:08.052
So annoying.

01:08:13.717 --> 01:08:15.699
It's all right.
There's still tomorrow.

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:22.416
David: <i>But that night we get a
frustrating phone call.</i>

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.191
My concern is that we can't
do more or less anything

01:08:26.288 --> 01:08:27.889
we have planned for
the rest of the trip.

01:08:29.232 --> 01:08:30.988
I know. It's, like,
it's fuckin' insane.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.538
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:08:37.261 --> 01:08:40.106
David: <i>All the threats are
worrying our film's producer.</i>

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:41.866
<i>He doesn't want us
to risk provoking</i>

01:08:41.964 --> 01:08:44.362
<i>any further legal action
from D'Amato.</i>

01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:45.736
So he's saying,

01:08:45.738 --> 01:08:47.527
"well, what if you do everything
that you were gonna do,

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:49.639
except don't go and
chase D'Amato down?"

01:08:49.737 --> 01:08:51.301
And I'm like,
"well, anything we do

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:53.254
that lets D'Amato know we're
looking into him again."

01:08:53.352 --> 01:08:55.140
- Well, from now on in is that.
- Yeah, literally.

01:08:55.238 --> 01:08:57.796
So he says, "well, maybe we cut
the thing short, then."

01:08:58.598 --> 01:08:59.843
Just go home."

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.595
I know it's like...
It's fuckin' insane.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.649
David: <i>The next day we put
chasing D'Amato on hold.</i>

01:09:18.756 --> 01:09:20.738
<i>I want to know how on earth</i>

01:09:20.836 --> 01:09:23.169
<i>a former deputy principal
pays for all this.</i>

01:09:23.747 --> 01:09:27.008
<i>We can't find any sign he's
earning money from the videos,</i>

01:09:27.106 --> 01:09:29.631
<i>but he's spending lots
of money making them.</i>

01:09:30.113 --> 01:09:33.310
<i>He's flying up to ten people
into la almost every month</i>

01:09:33.408 --> 01:09:35.261
<i>from all
over the world,</i>

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:36.828
<i>putting them up
in a nice hotel,</i>

01:09:36.926 --> 01:09:39.163
<i>paying them thousands in cash.</i>

01:09:39.581 --> 01:09:41.182
<i>And that's not even taking
into account</i>

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.558
<i>the cost of running
tickle cells,</i>

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.377
<i>like the one in muskegon.</i>

01:09:46.363 --> 01:09:48.441
<i>Both David's parents
are now deceased,</i>

01:09:48.538 --> 01:09:51.287
<i>but his father's law firm is
one of wall street's biggest.</i>

01:09:52.026 --> 01:09:54.103
<i>Maybe David is
reaping the benefits</i>

01:09:54.104 --> 01:09:55.767
<i>of his father's empire.</i>

01:09:58.233 --> 01:09:59.446
Woman:
<i>D'Amato & Lynch.</i>

01:09:59.544 --> 01:10:03.284
Oh, hi.
I just had an inquiry, um,

01:10:03.382 --> 01:10:06.835
about the relationship with,
uh, um,

01:10:06.933 --> 01:10:11.282
David D'Amato with the company,
the son of George D'Amato.

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.298
Is there someone I could
talk to about this?

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:18.896
<i>No, I'm sorry. And Mr. D'Amato
has been gone for a long time.</i>

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:24.431
Yeah, yeah. I'm looking into the
background to his son, David.

01:10:24.529 --> 01:10:26.286
And I'm just trying to figure
out whether he's got

01:10:26.384 --> 01:10:29.294
any financial relationship
with the company still.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:32.877
<i>No, I... I really don't know.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.</i>

01:10:32.975 --> 01:10:36.684
Is there someone I could talk to
at D'Amato & Lynch to find out?

01:10:37.582 --> 01:10:40.844
<i>Mm. Not that I believe, no.
I'm sorry.</i>

01:10:40.942 --> 01:10:43.308
Okay, but there must be a
way to find out, surely?

01:10:43.789 --> 01:10:47.563
<i>Um, not here. Thank you.</i>

01:10:59.372 --> 01:11:02.634
Woman: <i>I haven't seen David
in quite a few years.</i>

01:11:02.732 --> 01:11:04.234
<i>I have no knowledge of him now.</i>

01:11:04.843 --> 01:11:07.432
<i>Not in many years have I
had any contact with him,</i>

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:09.607
<i>so I really couldn't give
you any information.</i>

01:11:09.705 --> 01:11:12.519
David: <i>Yeah, he's been
pretty aggressive towards me,</i>

01:11:12.617 --> 01:11:15.206
<i>so I'm just trying to figure
out what his motivations are...</i>

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.385
Woman: <i>Get away from him,
that's all I can tell you.</i>

01:11:18.183 --> 01:11:21.220
- David: <i>Really?
- Yeah. Stay away from him.</i>

01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:33.923
David: <i>This was every
conversation I had</i>

01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:37.474
<i>with anyone even remotely
related to David D'Amato.</i>

01:11:37.572 --> 01:11:40.578
<i>"I can't tell you anything,
but stay away."</i>

01:11:40.675 --> 01:11:43.041
<i>But all I want to
do is the opposite.</i>

01:11:43.139 --> 01:11:46.465
<i>Someone has to confront this
bully, lawsuits or not.</i>

01:11:59.842 --> 01:12:03.712
Dylan: Okay. So, this is the car
we're looking for.

01:12:03.809 --> 01:12:07.294
It's a Mercedes Benz ml430.

01:12:12.831 --> 01:12:15.901
David: <i>David D'Amato has gone
out of his way to avoid us.</i>

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.748
<i>We figure if we wait outside
his apartment long enough,</i>

01:12:18.846 --> 01:12:20.732
<i>eventually he'll have to leave.</i>

01:12:21.694 --> 01:12:23.771
Dylan: So, that's a Chevrolet.

01:12:24.956 --> 01:12:26.276
Oh, hang on a second,
what's this?

01:12:26.364 --> 01:12:27.418
What's this? What's this?

01:12:28.187 --> 01:12:29.656
Okay, there's a car there.
I can see it.

01:12:29.754 --> 01:12:31.832
Now, just in the edge. Hang on.

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:39.031
David: A grand Cherokee.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.134
Well, maybe just a Cherokee.

01:12:42.231 --> 01:12:44.021
But it's certainly
not a Mercedes.

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:52.820
- David: What's the time?
- Dylan: 2:44.

01:12:52.918 --> 01:12:55.699
So we've been here for,
like, four hours?

01:12:59.604 --> 01:13:02.290
David: <i>We've been waiting
like this for days.</i>

01:13:03.507 --> 01:13:04.528
Dylan: Come on.

01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:07.440
David: <i>And it seems like
he'll never come out.</i>

01:13:09.553 --> 01:13:11.274
Dylan: Okay. Let me just check.
It's also...

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:16.175
It is the right type of car.
It's got white plates.

01:13:16.784 --> 01:13:18.542
Hang on. Hang on. Okay.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:21.804
It's him. It's him.
It's him. It's him.

01:13:25.038 --> 01:13:26.924
He's coming out. Just wait here.

01:13:27.021 --> 01:13:29.195
Just sit here.
All right, stay cool.

01:13:30.252 --> 01:13:31.530
Okay, I'm gonna...

01:13:38.378 --> 01:13:39.656
Okay, he's up here.

01:13:47.016 --> 01:13:48.806
He's in the right-hand...
Is he in the left-hand Lane?

01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:50.150
David: Yeah.

01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:54.403
He hasn't turned right.
He's in...

01:13:54.501 --> 01:13:55.522
Whoa! You're one car behind him.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.274
You're right in his...
In his mirror now.

01:14:15.744 --> 01:14:18.237
- I'm breathing heavily.
- Yeah, same.

01:14:19.358 --> 01:14:21.756
Dylan: Okay. Okay. It's cool.

01:14:21.885 --> 01:14:23.686
We're right behind him now,
so back off a bit,

01:14:23.773 --> 01:14:25.178
so we're not gonna be too close.

01:14:27.195 --> 01:14:28.697
Okay.

01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:32.313
Just stay... stay back.
Stay back, David.

01:14:32.602 --> 01:14:34.072
We're gonna have to
stop right behind him now.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.290
You might have to take the
camera off the tripod, Dom.

01:14:37.176 --> 01:14:38.870
David: Yeah, camera
off tripod, please.

01:14:40.567 --> 01:14:41.780
Dylan: Starbucks?
Okay, this is perfect.

01:14:41.878 --> 01:14:43.079
David: Okay. He'll be a while.

01:14:44.245 --> 01:14:46.766
Okay. I'm just gonna go and have
conversation when he comes out.

01:14:48.564 --> 01:14:50.289
You've... I've got my
phone if you need me.

01:14:50.387 --> 01:14:51.664
Okay.

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.010
David: <i>I'm about to meet
this man who's been</i>

01:15:05.073 --> 01:15:06.414
<i>such a threatening figure</i>

01:15:06.512 --> 01:15:09.581
<i>in so many lives,
including my own,</i>

01:15:11.247 --> 01:15:14.284
<i>and I have simply no idea
what to expect.</i>

01:15:38.381 --> 01:15:41.387
- Dylan: He's coming out.
- David: Mr. D'Amato.

01:15:42.124 --> 01:15:44.586
- Hi, it's Dave Farrier.
- D'Amato:

01:15:44.684 --> 01:15:46.249
David: Hey, how are you?

01:15:47.466 --> 01:15:49.160
D'Amato:

01:15:49.321 --> 01:15:52.165
David: I just wanted
to talk to you briefly.

01:15:52.999 --> 01:15:54.245
If I could.

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:57.859
Because I was just...
I'm just worried about...

01:16:00.837 --> 01:16:02.210
The legal letters
you've sent me,

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.781
and I just wanted to know
if we could

01:16:03.876 --> 01:16:05.506
just talk about it face-to-face.

01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:08.225
D'Amato:

01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:09.632
David: Is there?

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:13.024
D'Amato:

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:22.590
I'm on a journalism visa,
so I'm, I'm okay to be here.

01:16:22.688 --> 01:16:24.445
I'm okay to be here.
But I just...

01:16:26.526 --> 01:16:28.188
Could we just talk a
little bit about...

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:31.099
I just wanted to find
out what's going on.

01:16:31.356 --> 01:16:32.601
D'Amato:

01:16:32.699 --> 01:16:36.056
Because the last heard I was
gonna be in a us court

01:16:36.185 --> 01:16:37.239
and a New Zealand court,

01:16:37.241 --> 01:16:39.766
and I really just wanted to
sort this out face-to-face.

01:16:39.864 --> 01:16:41.046
D'Amato:

01:16:41.144 --> 01:16:42.421
And I just want to sort of...

01:16:42.519 --> 01:16:43.880
I mean,
I'm not here to antagonize.

01:16:43.958 --> 01:16:46.292
I just genuinely want
to be able to help out.

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:48.531
D'Amato:

01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:50.354
Well, you did say you were
gonna sue me.

01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:52.369
And I just wanna sort this
issue out.

01:16:53.746 --> 01:16:55.408
D'Amato:

01:16:55.506 --> 01:16:57.392
Could you contact me
if possible?

01:17:20.912 --> 01:17:23.054
David: <i> I went away feeling numb.</i>

01:17:23.311 --> 01:17:26.923
<i>D'Amato was calm, going
instantly to legal threats,</i>

01:17:27.405 --> 01:17:30.923
<i>which is what he's always done,
I suppose, as Terri,</i>

01:17:31.404 --> 01:17:32.681
<i>as Jane,</i>

01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:34.440
<i>as himself.</i>

01:17:40.617 --> 01:17:43.750
<i>But after all this, I still
couldn't help but wonder</i>

01:17:43.848 --> 01:17:45.669
<i>were we totally certain that
D'Amato</i>

01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:48.964
<i>really was Jane and Debbie?
Could we be wrong?</i>

01:17:50.085 --> 01:17:52.323
<i>So we went back to
where it all started,</i>

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:53.858
<i>those 300 domain names</i>

01:17:53.956 --> 01:17:56.481
<i>connected to
the Nederdietsen group.</i>

01:17:59.010 --> 01:18:01.599
<i>And that's when things
went a little crazy.</i>

01:18:02.081 --> 01:18:03.422
<i>On one of those
domain names</i>

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.438
<i>there was
just a directory listing,</i>

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.541
<i>including a folder called
"my documents".</i>

01:18:11.838 --> 01:18:13.532
<i>It looks like D'Amato
has accidently</i>

01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:16.379
<i>made hundreds of his
private files public</i>

01:18:16.765 --> 01:18:18.075
<i>on the Internet.</i>

01:18:23.484 --> 01:18:25.146
<i>There's D'Amato's signature</i>

01:18:25.211 --> 01:18:27.928
<i>on a Nederdietsen
registration form.</i>

01:18:30.713 --> 01:18:33.367
<i>There's also a contract with
the investigation company</i>

01:18:33.464 --> 01:18:35.030
<i>he hired to look into us.</i>

01:18:35.479 --> 01:18:37.205
<i>The address is exactly the same</i>

01:18:37.302 --> 01:18:39.540
<i>as the address used by
Jane O’Brien media</i>

01:18:39.638 --> 01:18:42.419
<i>when booking rooms at the
Hilton in New Zealand.</i>

01:18:45.428 --> 01:18:47.282
<i>Then there are documents
and signatures</i>

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.937
<i>for Debbie Kuhn
and Jane O’Brien...</i>

01:18:51.762 --> 01:18:54.255
<i>Who's also got her
own credit card.</i>

01:18:55.377 --> 01:18:56.783
<i>And it turns out that D'Amato</i>

01:18:56.912 --> 01:18:58.958
<i>did finally
get that law degree,</i>

01:18:59.055 --> 01:19:01.933
<i>from Hofstra university
in 2011.</i>

01:19:03.983 --> 01:19:06.861
<i>He's also been telling the boys
to enter the United States</i>

01:19:06.959 --> 01:19:09.900
<i>on a tourist visa,
even though they're working.</i>

01:19:11.342 --> 01:19:12.779
<i>And it's finally clear to me</i>

01:19:12.877 --> 01:19:15.050
<i>how he funds
his tickling empire.</i>

01:19:17.131 --> 01:19:18.633
<i>As of late 2012,</i>

01:19:18.731 --> 01:19:21.928
<i>he had almost six million
in his checking account.</i>

01:19:23.017 --> 01:19:25.639
<i>And his living expenses were
being paid by a trust</i>

01:19:25.737 --> 01:19:27.558
<i>established by his father.</i>

01:19:30.888 --> 01:19:33.606
<i>He also inherited millions from
his mother's estate</i>

01:19:33.704 --> 01:19:35.652
<i>when she died in 2014.</i>

01:19:38.022 --> 01:19:40.004
<i>It's all family money.</i>

01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:45.315
<i>There are also lots of emails</i>

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:47.746
<i>sent from Jane O'brien's
legal department.</i>

01:19:48.963 --> 01:19:52.608
<i>With this in mind, we call
in to see Romeo Salta,</i>

01:19:52.706 --> 01:19:54.912
<i>the lawyer hired
by Jane O’Brien media</i>

01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:57.407
<i>who's been sending us all
the legal threats.</i>

01:19:58.145 --> 01:20:00.351
<i>We want to ask him about
the correspondence</i>

01:20:00.448 --> 01:20:02.046
<i>his office has sent us.</i>

01:20:02.528 --> 01:20:04.669
David: <i>But I just thought
you'd be curious to see...</i>

01:20:05.182 --> 01:20:07.324
<i>Things been issued
in la county court,</i>

01:20:07.422 --> 01:20:09.275
<i>that's signed off here
with your name.</i>

01:20:09.693 --> 01:20:12.282
<i>There's another example of that
with that email address.</i>

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.241
Romeo: <i> Yeah.</i>

01:20:13.243 --> 01:20:15.832
To that, as opposed to you. I mean,
we got the one from you originally,

01:20:15.834 --> 01:20:17.464
which we... it's fine. We don't
need to talk about that.

01:20:17.561 --> 01:20:19.383
It's very simple.
I only sent one.

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.502
Dylan: Yeah.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.621
David: Yeah.

01:20:21.719 --> 01:20:23.061
- There's your answer.
- Yeah.

01:20:24.566 --> 01:20:26.260
Romeo: I'll see what I can do to
make those stop.

01:20:26.358 --> 01:20:27.635
Have they stopped?

01:20:27.796 --> 01:20:29.106
Dylan: Uh, we haven't heard
anything for a little while.

01:20:29.204 --> 01:20:30.194
They're listing your address

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.857
as their corporate headquarters,
though.

01:20:33.875 --> 01:20:35.504
- My address?
- Yeah, if you look at...

01:20:35.602 --> 01:20:36.623
David: Your office.

01:20:38.065 --> 01:20:39.087
Dylan: Janeobrienmedia. Com,

01:20:39.088 --> 01:20:40.110
your address is listed as their
corporate headquarters.

01:20:40.464 --> 01:20:42.286
Yeah, but it's not my...

01:20:42.383 --> 01:20:43.821
Dylan: No, no.
On their website at the bottom.

01:20:43.919 --> 01:20:45.548
Romeo: But it's not, um...

01:20:45.902 --> 01:20:47.244
Dylan: I don't know if it's...

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:48.459
It says
"office of corporate counsel

01:20:48.557 --> 01:20:49.770
and New York headquarters."

01:20:49.868 --> 01:20:51.108
Romeo: Well, that's my address.

01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:54.008
David: Yeah.

01:20:54.009 --> 01:20:55.559
- But it's not their...
- It's crazy. But it's...

01:20:55.721 --> 01:20:58.054
Um, I mean,
is this weird to you?

01:20:58.152 --> 01:20:59.352
That this person
has taken on...

01:20:59.399 --> 01:21:00.612
It is. Of course, it's weird.

01:21:05.892 --> 01:21:08.098
David: <i>Almost every legal letter
we'd received from</i>

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:09.602
<i>from Salta was fake.</i>

01:21:09.859 --> 01:21:12.385
<i>Like so many things
connected to D'Amato,</i>

01:21:12.483 --> 01:21:13.952
<i>they were all just lies,</i>

01:21:14.465 --> 01:21:17.535
<i>lies to support his addiction
to tickling videos.</i>

01:21:20.801 --> 01:21:24.094
<i>I started this journey curious
about a bizarre sport</i>

01:21:24.192 --> 01:21:26.429
<i>called competitive
endurance tickling,</i>

01:21:27.071 --> 01:21:30.108
<i>but I now think this was
never even about tickling.</i>

01:21:32.957 --> 01:21:36.123
<i>This is about power,
control and harassment.</i>

01:21:36.605 --> 01:21:38.619
<i>It's about one person's
twistedness</i>

01:21:38.716 --> 01:21:40.602
<i>and how far that can go.</i>

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.481
<i>One person who's managed to
shelter himself with money</i>

01:21:43.579 --> 01:21:45.785
<i>to keep his obsession going.</i>

01:21:46.362 --> 01:21:48.439
<i>But now it's his life exposed.</i>

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.414
<i>For once, it's him on camera.</i>

01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:57.781
<i>Before we leave America,</i>

01:21:57.879 --> 01:22:00.757
<i>there's one last phone call
I want to make.</i>

01:22:00.855 --> 01:22:02.836
<i>It's a name we found
in the documents,</i>

01:22:02.934 --> 01:22:06.355
<i>one of David D'Amato's last
surviving family members.</i>

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.041
Dorothy: <i> Hello?</i>

01:22:09.139 --> 01:22:11.889
- Oh, hi. Is that Dorothy?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:22:11.986 --> 01:22:13.872
Oh, hi. My name's David Farrier,

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:16.815
I'm a journalist from
New Zealand. How are you?

01:22:17.328 --> 01:22:18.734
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Yeah, good.

01:22:18.832 --> 01:22:20.270
Hey, sorry, it's probably a bit
of a strange call

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:21.448
to receive out of the blue,

01:22:21.614 --> 01:22:25.964
but I'm doing a story about,
uh, David D'Amato.

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:31.274
- <i>Oh, in what way?</i>
- Um...

01:22:32.363 --> 01:22:34.345
He's been... it's the...

01:22:34.506 --> 01:22:36.647
He's sort of back to the
tickling stuff again.

01:22:37.064 --> 01:22:38.278
<i>Oh, he is?</i>

01:22:38.375 --> 01:22:41.476
- Yeah, he is.
<i>- Oh, god!</i>

01:22:42.597 --> 01:22:44.867
<i>Well, I will tell you that,</i>

01:22:44.965 --> 01:22:48.482
<i>um, I have no contact
with him at all.</i>

01:22:49.796 --> 01:22:52.321
I mean, did you think all this
had sort of come to an end?

01:22:52.834 --> 01:22:54.815
<i>I did think, of course,
it came to an end,</i>

01:22:54.913 --> 01:22:58.111
<i>because he served time,
which I'm sure you know.</i>

01:22:58.208 --> 01:22:59.230
Mm.

01:22:59.328 --> 01:23:01.501
<i>But I don't understand, um...</i>

01:23:03.838 --> 01:23:06.651
<i>I don't understand why he
went back to doing this.</i>

01:23:08.252 --> 01:23:11.513
<i>I'm, like, in shock. How long
has he been doing this?</i>

01:23:13.275 --> 01:23:14.904
It's never stopped.

01:23:19.353 --> 01:23:21.847
<i>I think he has a
split personality.</i>

01:23:21.945 --> 01:23:25.205
<i>He's like that fine line
between genius and insanity.</i>

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:31.572
<i>I don't know if he's gay
or he's asexual,</i>

01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:34.931
<i>but he's never had a girlfriend
that I ever knew of.</i>

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.898
<i>I asked my husband once, um,</i>

01:23:38.995 --> 01:23:41.969
<i>if he would be upset if
he found out he was gay.</i>

01:23:42.067 --> 01:23:46.545
<i>And he said that he would be
upset but he would get over it.</i>

01:23:46.643 --> 01:23:48.208
<i>But he was an only child,</i>

01:23:48.306 --> 01:23:51.023
<i>and, you know, he wanted
grandchildren.</i>

01:23:53.584 --> 01:23:56.813
<i>He had a very,
very strange childhood.</i>

01:23:57.743 --> 01:24:01.836
<i>The kids used to make
fun of him all the time.</i>

01:24:01.997 --> 01:24:04.363
<i>And she used to...
She... his mother.</i>

01:24:04.461 --> 01:24:06.538
<i>He was very close
to his mother.</i>

01:24:07.115 --> 01:24:09.481
<i>And his mother was very
protective of him.</i>

01:24:09.579 --> 01:24:14.601
<i>She never let him ride a bike
or go skiing or do anything</i>

01:24:14.699 --> 01:24:16.872
<i>because she was always afraid
that he would get hurt.</i>

01:24:17.737 --> 01:24:19.014
<i>And from what I understand,</i>

01:24:19.112 --> 01:24:20.774
<i>the kids used to come around
the house,</i>

01:24:20.872 --> 01:24:22.309
<i>and they used to
make fun of him.</i>

01:24:22.407 --> 01:24:25.797
<i>And once they locked him
in a locker in school.</i>

01:24:29.574 --> 01:24:31.108
<i>And, you know,
he was a teacher...</i>

01:24:32.389 --> 01:24:34.147
<i>And they threw him
out of school.</i>

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.674
<i>You know, I was afraid of him,</i>

01:24:37.187 --> 01:24:41.888
<i>because I'm alone and, um...
Yeah, I was afraid of him.</i>

01:24:41.986 --> 01:24:45.119
<i>So, you know,
I'm afraid of him.</i>

01:24:46.305 --> 01:24:52.214
