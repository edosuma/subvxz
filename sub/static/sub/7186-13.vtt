my pirate crew?

01:11.971 --> 01:13.005
Great!

01:13.007 --> 01:14.673
To start
today's adventure,

01:14.675 --> 01:17.443
everybody say
the pirate password.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.144
Yo-ho-ho!

01:19.146 --> 01:21.113
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:21.115 --> 01:22.581
One more time.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.416
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:28.588 --> 01:31.790
[Hook] Mr. Smee!
Sharky, Bones!

01:31.792 --> 01:34.159
All hands on deck!

01:35.562 --> 01:40.299
- All hands are here, cap'n!
- And feets, too!

01:40.301 --> 01:44.770
Mr. Smee, where is that
bedtime story I asked for?

01:44.772 --> 01:48.140
You know I can't fall asleep
without an exciting story!

01:48.142 --> 01:50.442
Oh, I know, sir, I know.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.245
The boys and I have been
workin' on it, cap'n.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.114
Real hard, we have.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.650
Here's a rousing tale
for you, sir.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.587
<i>The Three Little</i>
<i>Pirate Piggies.</i>

02:01.589 --> 02:03.889
[sighs] I've heard
that old story

02:03.891 --> 02:07.159
at least 3,000 times. Next.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.528
[chuckling]
<i>Green Coconuts and Jam.</i>

02:09.530 --> 02:12.097
[Hook] Boring!

02:12.099 --> 02:13.232
Next!

02:13.234 --> 02:15.968
Oh, here's one of me favorites.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.504
<i>Goodnight, Skull Rock.</i>

02:18.506 --> 02:20.672
Goodnight, no!

02:20.674 --> 02:22.841
I want a story
with thrills!

02:22.843 --> 02:25.077
With excitement!
Keep looking!

02:29.749 --> 02:31.016
[coughs]

02:31.018 --> 02:33.986
Oh! Here's one
I've never seen before.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.787
Oh, my!

02:35.789 --> 02:39.124
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my!

02:39.126 --> 02:40.692
[Hook] What are you
babbling about, Smee?

02:40.694 --> 02:43.228
Is that a story
worthy of my time?

02:43.230 --> 02:47.566
Oh, I'm sure you've never
heard this one before, sir!

02:47.568 --> 02:50.135
[clears throat]

02:50.137 --> 02:51.937
Give me that!

02:51.939 --> 02:53.705
[sighs]

02:53.707 --> 02:56.041
"According to the Never Land
Pirate Code of rules

02:56.043 --> 03:00.078
the sailing ship
known as the <i>Buccaneer..."</i>

03:00.080 --> 03:01.480
The <i>Buccaneer?</i>

03:01.482 --> 03:03.148
Why, that must be
the full name

03:03.150 --> 03:07.286
of Jake and the sea pups'
pirate ship, Bucky.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.655
"...the <i>Buccaneer,</i>
<i>must engage</i>

03:09.657 --> 03:13.792
in a Great Race against
the    <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

03:13.794 --> 03:15.727
The Great Race must begin

03:15.729 --> 03:19.164
on the day following the
first blue moon of the year!"

03:19.166 --> 03:21.900
Wait, that be tomorrow!

03:21.902 --> 03:25.637
"If the <i>Buccaneer</i>
<i>has the misfortune</i>

03:25.639 --> 03:27.706
to lose the Great Race,

03:27.708 --> 03:30.809
its ownership
by Jake and his crew

03:30.811 --> 03:34.880
will go to
Captain James Hook!"

03:34.882 --> 03:37.883
Oh, dear! That's you!

03:37.885 --> 03:41.620
It is indeed, Mr. Smee.

03:41.622 --> 03:45.924
Oh, look, cap'n.
You forgot to read this part.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.595
"However, the previous owners
of the <i>Buccaneer,</i>

03:49.597 --> 03:51.396
that's Jake and his mates,

03:51.398 --> 03:54.499
have one last chance to
get their ship back."

03:55.935 --> 04:00.372
Let's see... "Island, bell,
mighty dragon."

04:00.374 --> 04:03.208
Oh, we don't need this!
It's not important!

04:03.210 --> 04:05.310
Not important at all!

04:05.312 --> 04:09.781
Um, beggin' your pardon, cap'n,
but what's it all mean?

04:09.783 --> 04:14.920
It means that if Bucky
loses the Great Race tomorrow,

04:14.922 --> 04:19.157
the puny pirates' ship
will belong to me!

04:19.159 --> 04:21.193
Oh, dear!

04:21.195 --> 04:25.197
You know, cap'n, Bucky might not
be so easy to beat in a race.

04:25.199 --> 04:28.634
He has lots of gizmos.
Fancy ones.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.202
A-ha!

04:30.204 --> 04:33.872
Mr. Smee, I've just come up
with a brilliant idea!

04:33.874 --> 04:36.742
To make sure that
I win the race

04:36.744 --> 04:38.777
and Bucky loses,

04:38.779 --> 04:44.049
I shall add lots of fancy
new gizmos to the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

04:44.051 --> 04:45.817
Step lively, men!

04:45.819 --> 04:48.820
There will be no
sleeping tonight.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.223
We have a race
to prepare for.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.425
and to win!

04:55.128 --> 04:58.230
<i>¶ Time to make</i>
<i>the</i> Jolly Roger <i>ready ¶</i>

04:58.232 --> 05:02.901
<i>¶ To win the Great Race</i>
<i>on the Never Sea ¶</i>

05:02.903 --> 05:04.736
<i>¶ There's orders</i>
<i>from the captain ¶</i>

05:04.738 --> 05:06.571
<i>¶ There be no time</i>
<i>for nappin' ¶</i>

05:06.573 --> 05:08.407
<i>¶ We'll cook up</i>
<i>something tricky ¶</i>

05:08.409 --> 05:10.108
<i>¶ With doodads</i>
<i>and doohickeys ¶</i>

05:10.110 --> 05:11.343
<i>¶ Then I'll cheat me way </i>

05:11.345 --> 05:13.945
<i>¶ Across the finish line </i>

05:13.947 --> 05:16.448
<i>¶ Oh, make ready </i>

05:16.450 --> 05:18.717
<i>¶ The</i> Jolly Roger <i>¶</i>

05:18.719 --> 05:21.286
<i>¶ Gizmos, gadgets</i>

05:21.288 --> 05:24.156
<i>¶ If Captain Hook</i>

05:28.729 --> 05:30.796
<i>¶ By hook or crook</i>
<i>I guarantee ¶</i>

05:30.798 --> 05:32.664
<i>¶ And when</i>
<i>the</i> Jolly Roger <i>wins ¶</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:34.433
<i>¶ Then Bucky will be mine </i>

05:34.435 --> 05:36.435

05:36.437 --> 05:41.373
<i>¶ Then Bucky will</i>
<i>belong to me ¶</i>

05:41.375 --> 05:43.709
[chuckles]

05:44.844 --> 05:47.412
[Jake] Yo ho, watch
the beach ball go!

05:49.949 --> 05:52.017
Nice block, Bucky!

05:52.019 --> 05:53.985
Look alive, matey. Duck!

05:53.987 --> 05:55.921
Shiver me timbers!

05:55.923 --> 05:58.357
I got it! [grunts]

06:00.259 --> 06:02.094
[grunts]

06:02.096 --> 06:03.829
Ah, coconuts!

06:03.831 --> 06:05.697
Good play, Bucky!

06:05.699 --> 06:08.700
You're really getting the hang
of Pirate Bop Beach Ball!

06:08.702 --> 06:09.901
Yo-ho!

06:11.104 --> 06:12.604
Go, go.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.808
Flyin' crackers!
Thar she goes!

06:16.810 --> 06:19.478
- [ball popping]
- And thar she blows.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.046
Hey, what happened
to our ball?

06:21.948 --> 06:25.217
Greetings, puny popinjays!

06:25.219 --> 06:26.985
If you're lookin'
to swipe some treasure,

06:26.987 --> 06:29.554
you've come to
the wrong place,
Captain Hook.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.123
Settle down, lad.
I'm not interested

06:31.125 --> 06:34.960
in plundering any
pirate treasure today.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.295
There are much bigger
things at stake!

06:37.297 --> 06:40.699
I'd say things
at least as big

06:40.701 --> 06:43.635
as a pirate ship!
Ha-ha!

06:43.637 --> 06:46.538
I think Hook's
finally gone crackers.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.808
This is no nonsense,
I assure you.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.711
I found this scroll
on me ship last night

06:52.713 --> 06:56.448
and I think you'll
find it fascinating.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.017
Read it and weep, boy!

06:59.019 --> 07:00.719
What's it say, Jake?

07:00.721 --> 07:03.488
It says here that Bucky has
to race the <i>Jolly Roger</i> today.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.991
and if Bucky loses,
Hook wins,

07:05.993 --> 07:09.161
and gets to take Bucky!

07:09.163 --> 07:11.863
- Yay-hey, no way!
- Rotten berries!

07:11.865 --> 07:14.099
This can't be happening!

07:14.101 --> 07:17.002
Oh, the cap'n speaks
the truth, sea pups.

07:17.004 --> 07:20.005
Hard to believe,
I know.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.074
According to the Never Land
Pirate Code of Rules,

07:23.076 --> 07:26.511
- you have no choice.
- That's correct.

07:26.513 --> 07:29.047
If you don't race,
that means you quit.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.516
and if you quit,
you lose.

07:31.518 --> 07:35.554
And Bucky will belong to,
dare I say it...

07:35.556 --> 07:37.989
Me. Captain Hook.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.524
Mm-hm. Him.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.026
[all] Never!

07:41.028 --> 07:42.828
Never say never.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.529
You're on, Hook.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.566
Bucky can beat
the <i>Jolly Roger</i>
<i>any old day!</i>

07:47.568 --> 07:50.035
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Ye thinks?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.736
I thinks.

07:53.239 --> 07:57.108
<i>¶ You want a race,</i>
<i>out on the Never Sea ¶</i>

07:57.110 --> 07:58.877
<i>¶ You'll never win </i>

07:58.879 --> 08:02.881
<i>¶ Cause my ship</i>
<i>can't be beat ¶</i>

08:02.883 --> 08:04.916
<i>¶ My ship is better</i>
<i>than your ship ¶</i>

08:04.918 --> 08:06.685
<i>¶ Ours is better</i>

08:06.687 --> 08:08.720
<i>¶ There is no faster</i>

08:08.722 --> 08:10.822
<i>¶ Except our ship,</i>
<i>of course ¶</i>

08:10.824 --> 08:12.791
<i>¶ Bucky's better</i>
<i>than your ship ¶</i>

08:12.793 --> 08:14.359
<i>¶ Bucky's better than yours </i>

08:14.361 --> 08:16.361
<i>¶ I'll win this race</i>
<i>and back again ¶</i>

08:16.363 --> 08:18.463
<i>¶ While you're still</i>
<i>on the shore ¶</i>

08:18.465 --> 08:22.400
<i>¶ You want a race</i>
<i>out on the Never Sea ¶</i>

08:22.402 --> 08:24.202
<i>¶ You'll never win </i>

08:24.204 --> 08:26.271
<i>¶ Cause my ship</i>
<i>can't be beat ¶</i>

08:26.273 --> 08:28.039
<i>¶ Let's have a race </i>

08:28.041 --> 08:29.908
<i>¶ Out on the Never Sea </i>

08:29.910 --> 08:31.943
<i>¶ We'll see which ship</i>
<i>is better ¶</i>

08:31.945 --> 08:34.813
¶ But I intend to cheat

08:34.815 --> 08:36.681
<i>¶ Before it starts</i>

<i>¶ My ship be better </i>

08:49.530 --> 08:50.595
<i>¶ Bucky's better </i>

08:50.597 --> 08:53.431
¶ Better, better than yours

08:53.433 --> 08:55.700
Oh, by the way,
little leader,

08:55.702 --> 08:58.904
the race begins
at Shipwreck Beach.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.406
See you at
the starting line!

09:01.408 --> 09:02.941
Um, Jake?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.609
What if we lose the race?

09:04.611 --> 09:06.745
We can't give up Bucky!

09:06.747 --> 09:08.547
We're not going to, Cubby.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.315
'Cause we're gonna win!

09:10.317 --> 09:13.451
Mateys, will you help us
win the Great Race?

09:15.054 --> 09:18.023
Aye-aye. That's what
I thought you'd say.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.425
This is a really
important adventure today,

09:20.427 --> 09:22.494
- 'cause we're
fighting for Bucky.
- [Bucky rings bell]

09:22.496 --> 09:24.396
We're gonna need
all hands on deck

09:24.398 --> 09:27.299
to solve every pirate problem
we come across.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.368
When we do, Gold Doubloons
will appear.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.670
Then we'll collect 'em,

09:31.672 --> 09:33.672
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

09:33.674 --> 09:37.275
And remember, Bucky's
counting on all of us.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.244
Is everybody ready?

09:39.246 --> 09:42.147
- I got my sword!
- I got my map!

09:42.149 --> 09:45.116
And I've got
my pixie dust!

09:45.118 --> 09:48.153
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.255
But only in emergencies.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.858
Yo ho, let's go
to the starting line!

09:56.596 --> 09:59.631
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

09:59.633 --> 10:02.267
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

10:02.269 --> 10:03.635
Let's go!

10:03.637 --> 10:06.671
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>together as a team ¶</i>

10:06.673 --> 10:11.710
<i>¶ Jake and the Never</i>
<i>Land Pirates and me ¶</i>

10:15.915 --> 10:17.949
[bell rings]

10:17.951 --> 10:21.386
Well, well, puniest
of puny pirates.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.722
It's about time
you showed up.

10:23.724 --> 10:27.559
I was worried that
you already gave up.

10:27.561 --> 10:30.395
Oh, there's nothing
to worry about, Hook.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.197
We're here to win.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.200
So let's get
this wing-ding started!

10:35.202 --> 10:37.502
Before we begin,
Sharky and Bones,

10:37.504 --> 10:39.838
who have read
all of the rules,

10:39.840 --> 10:42.941
would like to explain
how the Great Race will work.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.010
Hit it, boys!

10:46.912 --> 10:48.947
<i>¶ Grab your flag</i>
<i>and get your clue ¶</i>

10:48.949 --> 10:51.483
<i>¶ Figure it out</i>
<i>that's what you do ¶</i>

10:51.485 --> 10:53.752
<i>¶ Don't dilly dally</i>
<i>Don't be late ¶</i>

10:53.754 --> 10:56.187
<i>¶ And may the very best crew</i>
<i>win the race ¶</i>

10:56.189 --> 10:58.690
Awesome!
That sounds like fun.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.492
Oh, it will be fun.

11:00.494 --> 11:04.596
Once I win the race
and call Bucky me own!

11:04.598 --> 11:06.798
<i>¶ The first stop</i>
<i>on this sailin' race ¶</i>

11:06.800 --> 11:09.768
<i>¶ A cozy cove</i>
<i>where mermaids play ¶</i>

11:09.770 --> 11:11.670
<i>¶ Check your map</i>
<i>and compass, too ¶</i>

11:11.672 --> 11:17.042
<i>¶ You're sailin'</i>
<i>to Mermaid Lagoon ¶</i>

11:17.044 --> 11:20.211
Get ready, mateys!
This is for Bucky.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.514
- [bell rings]
- [all] Yay-hey!

11:22.516 --> 11:24.983
Hoist your sails.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.485
- Hands on the wheel.
- And...

11:27.487 --> 11:30.655
[both] Anchors away!

11:30.657 --> 11:32.791
[whistle blows]

11:32.793 --> 11:36.494
[Hook] Full speed ahead,
Mr. Smee.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.030
Speeding ahead, cap'n.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.066
[Jake] Full speed ahead,
Bucky!

11:41.068 --> 11:42.534
We want to get
to Mermaid Lagoon

11:42.536 --> 11:45.637
- way before Hook
gets there, right?
- [bell clangs]

11:45.639 --> 11:48.973
Come on, mateys.
Let's all cheer on Bucky.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.875
Go, Bucky, go!

11:50.877 --> 11:55.780
[all] Go, Bucky, go!
Go, Bucky, go!

11:55.782 --> 11:57.515
Well, well.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.317
Here comes the little ship

11:59.319 --> 12:01.286
that thinks he can.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.089
But I'm going to
show him he can't!

12:06.692 --> 12:08.493
[Cubby] Aw, coconuts!

12:08.495 --> 12:10.595
[Izzy] Yay-hey, no way.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.932
[cackling] Look like
I'm winning!

12:13.934 --> 12:15.967
And I plan to keep it that way.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.536
Oh... Good for you,
sir, but...

12:18.538 --> 12:21.306
...I don't think it's good
for my tender tummy!

12:21.308 --> 12:23.808
- [groans]
- Oh, pirate up, Smee.

12:23.810 --> 12:27.445
Unleash one of me
fancy new gizmos.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.981
The Colossal Coconut Cannon.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.050
Aye-aye, sir.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.888
One Colossal
Coconut Cannon.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.923
Just what
the cap'n ordered.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.725
Ready to roll, cap'n.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.127
Excellent!

12:42.129 --> 12:45.330
Now... fire!

12:48.801 --> 12:50.635
Firing!

12:50.637 --> 12:53.338
[Smee] Oh, coconuts!

12:54.874 --> 12:56.541
Ah, coconuts!

12:56.543 --> 12:58.643
Hook's really cheating, now!

12:58.645 --> 13:00.612
Well, we don't cheat.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.848
We're gonna win this race
fair and square.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.152
Well, whatever we do,
we'd better do it fast.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.053
Bucky's slowing down!

13:09.055 --> 13:11.556
Ha! Me plan is working!

13:11.558 --> 13:14.225
Just as I thought it would.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.194
Keep firing, Smee!

13:16.196 --> 13:19.197
Haven't we done enough damage
already, cap'n?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.432
- [growling]
- Firing, sir!

13:21.434 --> 13:22.801
[boom]

13:25.404 --> 13:27.338
Ah, more coconuts!

13:27.340 --> 13:28.506
What do we do?

13:36.282 --> 13:37.615
Check it out, mateys!

13:37.617 --> 13:40.385
Bucky's playing
Pirate Bop Beach Ball.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.220
Incoming!

13:42.222 --> 13:43.822
Incoming?

13:45.090 --> 13:47.659
[Smee] Dive! Dive! Dive!

13:48.594 --> 13:51.062
Smee, save me!

13:54.166 --> 13:56.267
[groans]

13:56.269 --> 13:58.203
[Jake] So long,
Captain Hook!

13:58.205 --> 14:01.005
Way-hey!
We raced ahead of Hook.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.441
and we got
three gold doubloons.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.544
Let's grab 'em and go
to Mermaid Lagoon.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.616
[Skully] Whoo-hoo!

14:11.618 --> 14:15.253
We're the first to make it
to Mermaid Lagoon!

14:16.322 --> 14:18.389
And there's our flag!

14:21.126 --> 14:22.327
Got it!

14:22.329 --> 14:25.096
[musical notes playing]

14:25.098 --> 14:27.732
<i>¶ Now you're here</i>

14:39.211 --> 14:42.113
Find a fish
that's not a fish?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.582
This is not
gonna be easy.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.018
Just keep your eyes
open, mateys.

14:47.020 --> 14:50.388
And let's see if we
can find this fish.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.692
Hey look, me hearties!

14:54.694 --> 14:57.862
- It's Gilly the Goldfish!
- Hello!

14:57.864 --> 15:00.298
Is Gilly a fish
that's not a fish?

15:00.300 --> 15:03.301
[giggles] I don't
think so, Cubby.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.337
Gilly's a fish
that is a fish.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.573
[trilling]

15:08.575 --> 15:10.008
Let's keep looking.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.843
The fish
that's not a fish

15:11.845 --> 15:15.179
has to be around here
somewhere.

15:15.181 --> 15:18.449
I told you to sail
faster, Smee!

15:18.451 --> 15:20.151
Thanks to you,

15:20.153 --> 15:22.253
we're in last place.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.355
Cheer up, cap'n. Look!

15:24.357 --> 15:26.357
There's our flag.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.059
Step aside, Smee.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.261
I'll take care of this.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.098
[musical notes playing]

A fish that's not a fish?

15:50.650 --> 15:53.584
Ooh, that's a
tough one, indeed.

15:53.586 --> 15:57.422
Then why are you just
standing there, Smee?

15:57.424 --> 15:59.557
Find that fish, uh...

15:59.559 --> 16:02.126
...that's not a fish!

16:02.128 --> 16:04.295

Ahoy, Sandy!

16:15.108 --> 16:17.909
Check it out, mates.
We did it!

16:17.911 --> 16:20.411
We found just what
we've been looking for.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.313
Sandy the Starfish!

16:22.315 --> 16:24.415
But Sandy's not a fish.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.683
[Jake] That's right.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.119
Sandy is a starfish!

16:28.121 --> 16:31.322
He's got the word "fish"
in his name.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.257
And that makes him...

16:33.259 --> 16:36.194
[all] A fish
that's not a fish!

16:36.196 --> 16:37.662
[all laughing]

16:37.664 --> 16:39.197
Yay-hey!

16:39.199 --> 16:40.932
We figured out the clue.

To Skull Rock.

So long, Sandy!

16:58.952 --> 17:01.319

17:01.321 --> 17:03.421
<i>¶ Good luck to you </i>

17:04.623 --> 17:07.725
[Hook] Have you found
anything yet, Smee?

17:07.727 --> 17:11.262
Does a soggy old boot count?

17:11.264 --> 17:13.197
Barnacles!

17:13.199 --> 17:16.634
I'll find that fish

[grunts]

17:20.173 --> 17:21.839
[scolding]

17:21.841 --> 17:24.275
Blasted starfish!

17:24.277 --> 17:25.977
I cannot stand...

17:25.979 --> 17:27.545
Cap'n, that's it!

17:27.547 --> 17:32.016
This starfish is the fish
that's not a fish.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.384
Don't be ridiculous!

17:33.386 --> 17:35.086
How can a starfish be...

17:35.088 --> 17:38.423
...a fish that's not a fish.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.125
"Fish" is part
of his name!

17:41.127 --> 17:43.961
I did it!
I figured out the clue!

17:43.963 --> 17:45.396
Uh, beggin'
your pardon, cap'n,

17:45.398 --> 17:46.898

Skull Rock, here we come!

18:11.357 --> 18:13.157
[Cubby] Yo ho, Bucky.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.893
We're in first place!

18:15.895 --> 18:19.964

19:32.772 --> 19:36.774
Oh, look at those smug,
smiling faces, Mr. Smee.

19:36.776 --> 19:40.111
Those pint-size pests
are in the lead again.

19:40.113 --> 19:44.282
Mark my words, they will
never win this race.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.718
Not while I've still got a
trick or two up me sleeve.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.621
Behold me newest trick.

19:50.623 --> 19:55.493
The Mighty Captain Hook
Grappling Hook!

20:04.336 --> 20:05.970
[all] Whoa!

20:05.972 --> 20:09.207
Yo ho, what do ya know!
Bucky's stuck.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.908
[Jake] And so are we!

20:10.910 --> 20:14.545
You certainly stopped
the pups this time, cap'n.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.048
Oh, but I'm not done
with them yet.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.951
Prepare the Pirate Propeller.

20:19.953 --> 20:21.786
Preparing, my cap'n!

20:27.492 --> 20:29.827
Come on, Bucky.
Try harder!

20:29.829 --> 20:31.462
You can do it!

20:31.464 --> 20:32.797
[Hook] See you later.

20:32.799 --> 20:36.567
After I win the race
and Bucky!

20:36.569 --> 20:39.003
- Coconuts!
- Hey!

20:39.005 --> 20:41.272
We can't let him
win the race!

20:41.274 --> 20:43.374
Maybe my sword
can help us.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.243
We've got to get
Bucky loose.

20:45.245 --> 20:48.279
[Hook] Is this not wonderful,
Mr. Smee?

20:48.281 --> 20:52.283
I'm winning,
I'm actually winning!

20:52.285 --> 20:55.486
I must say,
this is exciting, cap'n.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.854
Even though you cheated,

20:56.856 --> 20:59.924
played dirty tricks,
and, uh...

20:59.926 --> 21:02.793
I mean, keep up
the good work, sir!

21:02.795 --> 21:04.262
[nervous chuckle]

21:04.264 --> 21:07.298
Hold still, Bucky.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.867
[straining]
I almost got it.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.938
Bucky's free!

21:13.940 --> 21:17.275
Jake and the Never Land
Pirates never give up!

21:17.277 --> 21:19.076
You're right, Jake.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.145
[all] Never!

21:21.147 --> 21:24.348
Full speed ahead
to Skull Rock, Bucky.

21:25.183 --> 21:26.817
Let's win this race.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.023
Hurry, Smee!
We've no time to waste.

21:32.025 --> 21:35.326
[coughs] No time wastin'.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.462
Got it!

21:38.464 --> 21:41.299
[musical notes playing]

21:41.301 --> 21:43.934
<i>¶ You're racin' by</i>

21:43.936 --> 21:46.103
<i>¶ One more clue</i>

21:46.105 --> 21:48.406
<i>¶ The winning flag,</i>

21:48.408 --> 21:50.474
<i>¶ Is on an island</i>
<i>shaped like a bird ¶</i>

21:50.476 --> 21:53.144
<i>¶ Find an island</i>
<i>shaped like a bird ¶</i>

21:55.347 --> 21:58.616
A bird?
Ooh, sounds fascinating!

21:58.618 --> 22:01.385
Now, let's see.

22:01.387 --> 22:04.755
An island shaped
like a banana?

22:04.757 --> 22:07.591
An island shaped like
a bowling ball?

22:07.593 --> 22:10.261
[gasps] Glory be!

22:10.263 --> 22:13.898
An island shaped
like a bird!

22:13.900 --> 22:16.867
Move it, Smee!
I'm about to win!

22:20.806 --> 22:22.907
There's the flag.
Got you.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.509
[musical notes playing]

22:25.511 --> 22:27.878

¶ Find an island

22:39.358 --> 22:41.726
I've got this one, mateys!

22:41.728 --> 22:43.661
Spy this.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.597
It's Eagle Island.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.335
Push on, mateys.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.504
We've gotta find
the winning flag.

22:53.506 --> 22:57.475
- Do you mean, this flag?
- [all gasp]

22:59.845 --> 23:03.514
<i>¶ Hail to the pirate crew</i>
<i>who's in first place ¶</i>

23:03.516 --> 23:07.418

<i>- ¶ Hail </i>
<i>- ¶ To me </i>

23:09.322 --> 23:11.322
<i>¶ Your champion </i>

23:11.324 --> 23:13.858

23:13.860 --> 23:15.426
Hooray!

23:15.428 --> 23:19.397
<i>¶ And I will take</i>
<i>the</i> Buccaneer <i>away ¶</i>

23:19.399 --> 23:24.368
<i>¶ Captain Hook,</i>
<i>you won the race ¶</i>

23:24.370 --> 23:26.537
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
I won!

23:26.539 --> 23:30.541
I won the Great
Never Sea Race!

23:30.543 --> 23:33.644
Which means Bucky is mine!

23:33.646 --> 23:35.913
All mine!

23:35.915 --> 23:38.482
Yay-hey, no way!

23:38.484 --> 23:40.251
This can't be happening.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.453
How could we lose?

23:42.455 --> 23:46.490
'Tis a pity.
Losing hurts.

23:46.492 --> 23:49.860
Oh, the cap'n
knows all about losing.

23:49.862 --> 23:53.397
Why, he must be the biggest
loser in all of Never La...

23:53.399 --> 23:55.166
Enough, Smee.
They get the point.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.101
Now, on with it.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.837
As the Never Land
Pirate Code says,

23:59.839 --> 24:02.273
"If the <i>Buccaneer</i>
<i>has the misfortune</i>

24:02.275 --> 24:04.175
to lose the Great Race,

24:04.177 --> 24:08.579
its ownership by Jake
and his crew will go to..."

24:08.581 --> 24:11.549
Captain James Hook.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.518
In other words,
you lose, I win!

24:14.520 --> 24:17.455
And that's the way
the crackers crumble!

24:17.457 --> 24:19.290
[laughs]

24:20.826 --> 24:23.260
I'm sorry, Jake.

24:23.262 --> 24:27.198
But I'm afraid pirates' rules
are pirates' rules.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.833
Step lively, men!

24:28.835 --> 24:32.503
Tie the <i>Buccaneer</i> to
the    <i>Jolly Rog</i>at once!

24:32.505 --> 24:34.772
- Aye-aye.
- As you say, sir!

24:34.774 --> 24:36.440
Captain Hook...

24:36.442 --> 24:38.542
Could we please
say goodbye to Bucky?

24:38.544 --> 24:41.378
Oh, why,
of course, lad.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.714
It's the least I could do.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.716
The least!

24:45.718 --> 24:47.818
[bell rings]

24:52.123 --> 24:56.126
Things are never gonna be
the same without you.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.362
You're the best
pirate shipmate

24:58.364 --> 25:01.699
a pirate ever had.

25:01.701 --> 25:05.703
I'm gonna miss you, mate.

25:05.705 --> 25:08.005
This just isn't fair, Bucky.

25:09.374 --> 25:12.276
My, this is terribly sad.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.311
[sniffling]

25:14.313 --> 25:16.847
It be like watchin'
a ship sinkin'.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.417
To the bottom of
the deep, dark sea.

25:20.419 --> 25:23.487
[sobbing]

25:23.489 --> 25:26.857
I do so hate
to rush you, swabs.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.026
But I have a ship to sail.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.096
I mean, two ships to sail!

25:32.098 --> 25:34.632
[Hook laughing]

25:36.868 --> 25:39.737
Jake.
Without Bucky,

25:39.739 --> 25:42.907
how are we gonna get back
to Pirate Island?

25:42.909 --> 25:45.943
Well, we still have
pixie dust.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.712
Pixie dust, away.

25:52.984 --> 25:56.620
<i>¶ How do we say goodbye </i>

25:56.622 --> 26:01.025
<i>¶ To our best friend, Bucky </i>

26:01.027 --> 26:04.461
<i>¶ How do we say farewell </i>

26:04.463 --> 26:08.265
<i>¶ To a friend like you </i>

26:14.839 --> 26:18.309
<i>¶ We'll miss the sound</i>
<i>of your ringing bell ¶</i>

26:18.311 --> 26:22.313
<i>¶ And your sails</i>
<i>all full of sky ¶</i>

26:22.315 --> 26:26.116
<i>¶ We wish that we could</i>
<i>sail on home ¶</i>

26:26.118 --> 26:29.987
<i>¶ With you just</i>
<i>one last time ¶</i>

26:29.989 --> 26:33.724
<i>¶ How can we say</i>
<i>goodbye today ¶</i>

26:33.726 --> 26:37.328
<i>¶ Nothing will ever</i>
<i>be the same ¶</i>

26:37.330 --> 26:41.131
<i>¶ You're our best</i>
<i>friend, Bucky ¶</i>

26:41.133 --> 26:43.067
<i>¶ It's hard to say </i>

26:43.069 --> 26:46.637
<i>¶ Goodbye to you today </i>

26:53.044 --> 26:56.113
<i>¶ How do we say goodbye </i>

26:56.115 --> 26:59.850
<i>¶ To our best friend, Bucky </i>

26:59.852 --> 27:03.988
<i>¶ How do we say farewell </i>

27:03.990 --> 27:08.025
<i>¶ To a friend like you </i>

27:08.027 --> 27:10.461
<i>¶ Goodbye, friend </i>

27:10.463 --> 27:14.264
<i>¶ Bucky, sail away </i>

27:16.668 --> 27:18.202
Goodbye, Bucky.

27:21.840 --> 27:25.142
[Hook] Happy boots!
Happy boots!

27:25.144 --> 27:27.211
Ah, Smee,
just look at it!

27:27.213 --> 27:31.415
A second pirate ship,
and it's all mine!

27:31.417 --> 27:33.550
Ooh, how I love
the sound of that word.

27:33.552 --> 27:37.354
Mine, mine, mine, mine,
mine, mine, mine, mine!

27:40.025 --> 27:42.559
[shouting]

27:42.561 --> 27:44.995
What in plunder
happened, Smee?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.864
Did we hit something?

27:46.866 --> 27:49.600
Why, no, sir.
If I didn't know better,

27:49.602 --> 27:53.170
I'd say your new ship
stopped us all on his own.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.340
Oh, nonsense!
It's just a hunk of wood.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.876
It can't do anything
on its own.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.412
Now, sail on, Smee.

28:01.414 --> 28:05.549
Oh, dear me.
Sailing forward, sir.

28:13.324 --> 28:14.992
Careful, Cubby.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.428
Don't fly too low
or you'll be swimmin'.

28:17.430 --> 28:19.163
I can't help it.

28:19.165 --> 28:22.166
I just don't feel like
zippin' and zoomin'.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.268
Not after losing Bucky.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.770
But we haven't
lost him forever.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.238
We'll get him back.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.075
You've got a plan,
right, Jake?

28:31.077 --> 28:32.810
Not this time, Izzy.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.878
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

28:34.880 --> 28:39.416
Pirate Island just won't be
the same without Bucky.

28:40.285 --> 28:43.187
[bell ringing]

28:43.189 --> 28:45.689
[Hook] Thundering blunderbuss!

28:45.691 --> 28:50.194
Men! What is that
incessant ringing!?

28:50.196 --> 28:53.197
[all shouting]

28:53.199 --> 28:55.999
That infernal ship's bell.

28:56.001 --> 28:58.736
It's ruinin' me
beauty sleep!

28:58.738 --> 29:00.370
Beauty sleep?

29:00.372 --> 29:02.706
Well, it's a little
late for that, cap...

29:02.708 --> 29:04.575
Silence that bell!

29:04.577 --> 29:06.543
Toss it overboard
if you have to.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.178
Right away, cap'n.

29:09.447 --> 29:13.083
Sharky, Bones,
stop that blarin' bell.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.752
Do we have to?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.955
We don't think that ship
likes us much.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.423
Don't be silly.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.925
It's just an old boat.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.660
[ringing]

29:23.662 --> 29:26.430
How are we gonna stop it
ring-a-ding-dingin'?

29:26.432 --> 29:28.499
Well, we can throw it
in the drink,

29:28.501 --> 29:30.134
like the captain said.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.903
[gasps] It stopped.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.404
What did you do, Bones?

29:34.406 --> 29:37.107
[stammering]
I didn't do nothing.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.610
[both shouting]

29:39.612 --> 29:42.713
I tells ya, Bones,
this ship be haunted!

29:42.715 --> 29:44.982
[door opening]

29:44.984 --> 29:46.183
[bell rings]

29:46.185 --> 29:49.319
[both] Let's get out of here!

29:50.021 --> 29:52.422
[Cubby] Ah, coconuts.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.926
Bucky's grotto sure is
lonely without Bucky.

29:55.928 --> 29:59.963
[Izzy] It feels so...
empty.

29:59.965 --> 30:04.434
Hey. Remember the day we
gave Bucky his golden anchor?

30:04.436 --> 30:06.637
[Cubby] Yeah! Hook took it,

30:06.639 --> 30:08.672
and we helped Bucky
get it back!

30:08.674 --> 30:11.141
[giggles] And there's Bucky

30:11.143 --> 30:13.644
tossing that
cranky crook overboard.

30:13.646 --> 30:18.282
[chuckles] Hook didn't need
his whirly hook to go flying
that day.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.651
Bucky could always
beat Hook.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.953
[sighs] Until today.

30:22.955 --> 30:25.789
We've gotta get Bucky back.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.724
But how?

30:27.726 --> 30:30.194
Peter.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.029
That's it!

30:32.031 --> 30:34.198
Peter Pan can help us.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.501
Yeah! Wait 'til Peter
hears about this.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.337
It'll curl his pointy shoes!

30:42.006 --> 30:44.842
Mateys, turn on
the Lunar Lantern!

30:44.844 --> 30:48.011
Brightly,
shine extra-bright.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.713
[whistles]

30:55.420 --> 30:57.721
[Skully] Crackers,
would you look at that!

30:57.723 --> 31:00.557
[Jake] Yo ho, Brightly,
way to glow!

31:00.559 --> 31:02.559
[Brightly trills]

31:02.561 --> 31:05.729
Once Peter sees that,
no matter where he is,

31:05.731 --> 31:08.498
he'll come right away.
Come on.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.201
Everybody shout,
"Cock-a-doodle-doo.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.303
Peter Pan, we need you!"

31:13.305 --> 31:15.138
Ready?

31:15.140 --> 31:18.942
[all] Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Peter Pan, we need you!

31:18.944 --> 31:21.144
One more time, mateys!

31:21.146 --> 31:25.215
[all] Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Peter Pan, we need you!

31:26.851 --> 31:29.286
[Izzy gasps] Look!

31:31.856 --> 31:33.357
[crowing]

31:33.359 --> 31:34.858
[all] Peter Pan!

31:34.860 --> 31:37.728
Who'd you expect?
Captain Codfish?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.196
[laughs]

31:39.198 --> 31:40.497
Thanks for coming, Peter.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.233
Yeah, we really need ya.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.903
Uh-oh, crew.
Why so blue?

31:45.905 --> 31:47.938
You look like
your ship just sunk.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.741
Even worse.
Hook's got Bucky.

31:50.743 --> 31:53.777
It all started with a race
against the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

31:53.779 --> 31:57.180
We tried our best,
but Hook won.

31:57.182 --> 32:00.517
And according to the Never Land
Pirate Code of Rules,

32:00.519 --> 32:02.352
he got to take Bucky away.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.388
It's all in
this scroll, Peter.

32:04.390 --> 32:08.058
Ha! And lemme guess.
Hook cheated.

32:08.060 --> 32:11.895
Yeah.
The whole entire race!

32:11.897 --> 32:13.597
What do you think, Peter?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.632
Is there any way
to get Bucky back?

32:15.634 --> 32:16.833
I don't know.

32:16.835 --> 32:19.136
The Pirate Code
is pretty official.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.205
Wait a minute.
What happened to the bottom?

32:22.207 --> 32:24.207
There's a piece of
the scroll missing.

32:24.209 --> 32:27.978
Maybe there's more to the rules
than what Hook showed us.

32:27.980 --> 32:31.615
Yeah! This is the sneaky snook
we're talkin' about.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.251
Hook said he found the scroll
on the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

32:34.253 --> 32:36.420
What if the other piece
is still there?

32:36.422 --> 32:39.423
Well, mateys, it's
the only clue we've got.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.024
There's no time to lose.

32:41.026 --> 32:42.259
Quick!

32:42.261 --> 32:44.594
To the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

32:44.596 --> 32:46.096
[squeaking]

32:52.904 --> 32:55.672
Hey-ya, Bucky boy!

32:55.674 --> 32:58.241
We're glad to
see you, too.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.676
Peter's here to help.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.479
We're gonna figure out
a way to get you back.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.847
Now remember, mateys,

33:03.849 --> 33:05.515
we're looking for
a piece of paper

33:05.517 --> 33:07.818
that matches
this torn scroll.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.053
[all snoring]

33:13.491 --> 33:16.026
Maybe it's in
the codfish's cabin.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.295
[snoring]

33:32.610 --> 33:34.544
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

33:35.780 --> 33:38.515
[Izzy] Yo-ho, Peter,
way to go!

33:38.517 --> 33:41.118
We found the missing
piece of scroll.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.920
And got two more
gold doubloons.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.389
Let's grab 'em,

33:45.391 --> 33:48.725
and find out what the rest of
the Pirate Code scroll says.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.795
[clears throat]

33:51.797 --> 33:53.730
"If Captain Hook
wins the Great Race,

33:53.732 --> 33:55.932
the previous owners
of the <i>Buccaneer</i>

33:55.934 --> 33:59.803
have one last chance
to get their ship back.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.438
Go to the Island of Bell

34:01.440 --> 34:03.640
and retrieve
the Great Golden Bell

34:03.642 --> 34:05.709
before sunrise
the next day.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.210
Fulfill this task,

34:07.212 --> 34:10.280
and Bucky shall be
yours once more."

34:10.282 --> 34:13.316
No wonder Hook didn't
want us to see this.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.485
It means we can
get Bucky back.

34:15.487 --> 34:18.955
All we have to do is
find that Golden Bell.

34:18.957 --> 34:20.657
Before sunup.

34:20.659 --> 34:24.194
Wait.
There's something else.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.796
"Pirates beware!

34:25.798 --> 34:28.665
A mighty dragon lives
on the Island of Bell.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.902
And he doesn't like visitors."

34:31.904 --> 34:33.603
Ah, coconuts!

34:33.605 --> 34:35.205
Visitors?

34:35.207 --> 34:37.074
That's us!

34:37.076 --> 34:39.409
But don't worry,
Bucky boy.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.279
We'll get that bell,
set you free,

34:42.281 --> 34:44.815
and sail you back
to Pirate Island!

34:46.684 --> 34:48.985
Uh-oh. Hook heard that
for sure!

34:48.987 --> 34:50.520
What?

34:50.522 --> 34:52.923
Oh, that rotten ringing!

34:52.925 --> 34:56.726
I'll take care of that
clanging bell meself.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.428
Away we go, mateys.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.468
[grunts]

35:05.403 --> 35:07.070
This shall teach you.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.477
Now, perhaps
a pirate captain

35:13.479 --> 35:15.745
can get some shut-eye.

35:15.747 --> 35:18.448
Good night!

35:24.188 --> 35:25.622
Let's see.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.592
The Island of Bell
should be just up ahead.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.560
Oh, my map!

35:32.163 --> 35:33.797
Oh! Gotcha!

35:35.433 --> 35:37.267
Thanks, Peter! [chuckles]

35:37.269 --> 35:39.436
Hang on to your
pirate stuff mateys.

35:39.438 --> 35:42.172
It only gets windier
on the Island of Bell!

35:42.174 --> 35:45.642
Ooh! Flying against
that wind is a workout!

35:45.644 --> 35:47.410
Is that it?

35:47.412 --> 35:48.845
Oh, that's it,
all right.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.914
Let's land on top
of that peak.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.184
[growling]

35:56.454 --> 35:59.189
From here we can see
the whole island.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.391
Jake, got your spyglass?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.059
Aye, Peter!

36:03.061 --> 36:05.228
Can you spot
anything gold?

36:05.230 --> 36:06.796
There's a golden glow.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.498
In the next valley over.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.301
Something gold is hanging
from a giant tree.

36:11.303 --> 36:14.304
That's gotta be the bell
we're looking for.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.540
Let's fly, mateys.

36:16.542 --> 36:19.409
In this wind,
flying is too dangerous.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.312
We'd better hold hands
and hike to the giant tree.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.847
Come on!

36:26.250 --> 36:28.418
[Jake] We're getting closer
to the giant tree.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.487
And maybe the Great Golden Bell.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.857
Awesome! Except all this steam

36:33.859 --> 36:36.326
sure makes it hard
to see where we're going.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.128
Watch your step, mateys.

36:38.130 --> 36:42.265
That hot lava is
way too hot to touch.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.000
[Peter] Check it out.
Up ahead.

36:44.002 --> 36:47.137
The giant tree is just
under that stone arch.

36:47.139 --> 36:48.171
Whoa!

36:48.173 --> 36:50.941
This is one creepy island.

36:50.943 --> 36:52.909
Wind. Lava.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.245
Dragons. Steam.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.647
Did I mention dragons?!

36:57.649 --> 36:59.883
The glow in there
means more lava.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.585
We'll just hop over it
again, and...

37:01.587 --> 37:03.119
[loud screeching]

37:03.121 --> 37:04.654
Whoa!

37:07.592 --> 37:09.392
Sizzlin' coconuts!

37:09.394 --> 37:11.995
That's the mighty dragon!

37:11.997 --> 37:15.832
You know, the one who
doesn't like visitors!

37:15.834 --> 37:17.834
[roaring]

37:19.837 --> 37:22.205
Maybe we better
come back later.

37:22.207 --> 37:24.741
No way!
We can't give up now.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.576
Bucky's counting on us!

37:26.578 --> 37:27.944
Izzy's right.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.347
And together, as a team,

37:30.349 --> 37:32.849
I know we can do anything!

37:32.851 --> 37:34.284
Here's the plan.

37:34.286 --> 37:37.787
Jake, you and I will
distract old furnace face.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.122
Aye-aye, Peter.

37:39.124 --> 37:40.924
Cubby, Izzy, Skully.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.593
you run in and grab
the Golden Bell.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.296
And we'll meet up
and fly back to Bucky.

37:46.298 --> 37:49.299
Peter, you and Jake
can't face down that dragon

37:49.301 --> 37:50.800
all by yourselves.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.670
Ha-ha! Who said anything
about facing him?

37:53.672 --> 37:56.506
We're gonna keep as
far away as we can.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.409
I hear that.
Let's do this.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.044
For Bucky!

38:01.046 --> 38:03.213
[all] For Bucky!

38:03.215 --> 38:04.981
[roaring]

38:07.518 --> 38:10.353
<i>¶ We never let a matey down </i>

38:10.355 --> 38:13.490
<i>¶ And Bucky's</i>
<i>counting on us now ¶</i>

38:13.492 --> 38:15.058
Hey, Dragon-breath!

38:15.060 --> 38:16.793
Bet you can't catch us.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.194
<i>¶ Yo heave ho </i>

38:18.196 --> 38:20.096

38:37.516 --> 38:41.551
<i>¶ Staying brave</i>

38:41.553 --> 38:43.787
[both] Yeah!

38:45.056 --> 38:48.325
<i>¶ So if the wind</i>
<i>should blow and howl ¶</i>

38:48.327 --> 38:51.094

38:51.096 --> 38:52.595
Whoo-hoo!

38:52.597 --> 38:54.064
<i>¶ Yo heave ho </i>

38:54.066 --> 38:55.865

38:57.703 --> 39:00.737

39:00.739 --> 39:03.106

39:03.108 --> 39:06.142
<i>¶ What makes a hero </i>

39:06.144 --> 39:08.078
<i>¶ Is the strength</i>

39:08.080 --> 39:10.647
Come on. Let's get
that Golden Bell.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.450
<i>¶ Crewmates forever </i>

39:13.452 --> 39:17.153

39:24.262 --> 39:28.765
<i>¶ Staying brave</i>

39:28.767 --> 39:32.869
Old scaly-face'll be
chasin' his tail for hours.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.938
[chuckles] Dragons.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.574
They're fierce,
but not too bright.

39:41.278 --> 39:42.445
There it is.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.814
The giant tree Jake saw
from the mountain.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.217
Look at those weird leaves.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.452
Those aren't leaves, Skully.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.087
They're bells!

39:51.089 --> 39:53.423
But only one
of them is gold.

39:53.425 --> 39:56.126
[all] The Great Golden Bell.

39:56.128 --> 39:58.628
Yay-hey, we found it.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.530
Now, I guess
we've gotta fly.

40:00.532 --> 40:01.931
Ready, mateys?

40:04.568 --> 40:07.637
[gasps] Check out
the carving on the bell.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.339
That's Bucky!

40:09.341 --> 40:11.307
I'd recognize him anywhere.

40:11.309 --> 40:14.811
Yo ho! For finding
The Great Golden Bell,

40:14.813 --> 40:17.113
we got four more
gold doubloons!

40:17.115 --> 40:19.883
And all before
sunrise, too.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.818
Let's grab 'em and go.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.287
Quick, get the bell,

40:24.289 --> 40:26.389
before that big
beastie comes back!

40:26.391 --> 40:28.825
[all straining]

40:28.827 --> 40:31.461
It's... heavy!

40:34.165 --> 40:35.732
Ah, coconuts!

40:35.734 --> 40:37.467
- Got it.
- Peter. Jake.

40:37.469 --> 40:38.501
Thanks.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.904
This old dinger
sure is heavy.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.405
A little bit of Pixie Dust

40:42.407 --> 40:45.074
oughta help us
get it back to Bucky.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.811
[all] Yo ho, let's go!

40:54.518 --> 40:56.786
[pirates snoring]

40:56.788 --> 40:58.822
[Peter crowing]

40:58.824 --> 41:01.291
[Hook] What in plunder?

41:01.293 --> 41:04.661
Who brought a rooster
aboard me ship?

41:04.663 --> 41:06.896
It was me,
you old codfish.

41:06.898 --> 41:10.133
[gasps] Peter Pan?

41:10.135 --> 41:12.368
What are you doing here?

41:12.370 --> 41:14.904
Oh, just came by to
visit an old friend.

41:14.906 --> 41:15.939
[chuckles]

41:15.941 --> 41:19.309
We are not friends!

41:19.311 --> 41:21.110
I didn't mean you, silly.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.712
I meant Bucky.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.982
[Hook] Ah, me newest ship.

41:25.984 --> 41:29.319
The one I got by following
the Pirate Code.

41:29.321 --> 41:31.754
[all] Bucky is ours!

41:31.756 --> 41:34.824
Popinjays? I think not.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.293
I played by the Never Land
Pirate Code.

41:37.295 --> 41:40.430
I won and you lost.

41:40.432 --> 41:43.266
Winners keepers,
losers weepers.

41:43.268 --> 41:46.603
Now all of you,
off of me ship!

41:46.605 --> 41:48.238
[shouts]

41:48.240 --> 41:50.440
Not so fast, codfish.

41:50.442 --> 41:52.275
There were more
rules of the race

41:52.277 --> 41:55.211
that you forgot to
mention. Until now.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.813
[stammering]

41:56.815 --> 41:59.983
Why, there was nothing
I forgot to mention.

41:59.985 --> 42:03.753
[Jake] Looking for this,
Captain Hook?

42:03.755 --> 42:07.123
The rest of
the Pirate Code scroll?

42:07.125 --> 42:10.493
Why you sneaky scoundrels!

42:10.495 --> 42:12.529
It says we can
get Bucky back

42:12.531 --> 42:15.832
by getting
the Great Golden Bell
before sunrise.

42:15.834 --> 42:19.836
"Fulfill this task and Bucky
shall be yours once more."

42:19.838 --> 42:23.806
We're here to
collect our prize.

42:23.808 --> 42:26.242
[stammering]
What about the dragon?

42:26.244 --> 42:30.680
I've heard its fiery breath can
turn a ship to a crispy cinder!

42:30.682 --> 42:32.882
Yes! It's impossible.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.452
A band of puny pirates
like you could never...

42:36.454 --> 42:38.755
[all] Never say never!

42:38.757 --> 42:39.989
Barnacles!

42:39.991 --> 42:42.458
Is this some kind of
puny pirate trick?!

42:42.460 --> 42:44.894
[loud ringing]

42:44.896 --> 42:48.197
[Jake] Bucky! We did it!

42:48.199 --> 42:50.833
We saved you from Hook.

42:50.835 --> 42:53.169
And now we're
back together.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.305
We would never
let you down.

42:55.307 --> 42:56.606
Never ever.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.245
[all] Yo-ho, way to go!

43:02.247 --> 43:05.114
We'll always look out
for you, Bucky.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.349
Yay-hey.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.718
We got back
our good ship Bucky.

43:08.720 --> 43:11.554
And we got three more
gold doubloons.

43:11.556 --> 43:15.725
Let's grab 'em, and set sail
for Pirate Island.

43:19.163 --> 43:20.730
So long, Captain Hook.

43:20.732 --> 43:23.833
Been nice playin' by
the Pirate Rules with ya.

43:23.835 --> 43:25.635
[crowing]

43:25.637 --> 43:27.136
[bell rings]

43:29.273 --> 43:33.076
[sputtering]
Fie on you, Pan!

43:33.078 --> 43:37.447
And fie on your
little ship, too!

43:42.252 --> 43:46.489
<i>¶ You're our best</i>
<i>friend, Bucky ¶</i>

43:46.491 --> 43:48.458
<i>¶ Way hey hey </i>

43:48.460 --> 43:51.761
<i>¶ Bucky, sail away </i>

43:59.970 --> 44:01.704
Thanks for the ride, Bucky.

44:01.706 --> 44:03.906
It's great to have you back.

44:03.908 --> 44:06.376
And we're never
losing you again.

44:08.278 --> 44:10.480
Bucky says thanks
to all of you

44:10.482 --> 44:12.482
for helping too, mateys.

44:12.484 --> 44:14.984
What do you say we put
all our gold doubloons

44:14.986 --> 44:17.286
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.663

<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

44:33.772 --> 44:36.606
Come on.
Count with us.

44:37.775 --> 44:39.342
[all] Yeah!

44:40.511 --> 44:42.478
[Cubby] One, two...

44:42.480 --> 44:45.982
[Izzy] Three,
four, five, six...

44:45.984 --> 44:49.085
[Peter] Seven, eight, nine...

44:49.087 --> 44:53.022
[Jake] Ten, 11, 12!

44:53.024 --> 44:56.159
[Jake] Yo-ho!
For solving pirate problems

44:56.161 --> 44:58.394
and helping get back
our pal Bucky,

44:58.396 --> 45:01.664
we got 12 gold doubloons.

45:01.666 --> 45:03.499
Another great haul.

45:03.501 --> 45:06.469
You mateys sure do make
a fine pirate crew.

45:06.471 --> 45:08.871
I'm leaving Never Land
in great hands.

45:08.873 --> 45:12.208
Uh-oh, that sounds like
you're leaving us again.

45:12.210 --> 45:13.543
It's time, Cubby.

45:13.545 --> 45:16.813
There's more exploring to do
beyond the Never Sea.

45:16.815 --> 45:19.182
Well, thanks for comin'
to help us out.

45:19.184 --> 45:21.284
And for coming
to help Bucky.

45:21.286 --> 45:23.519
That's what
best mates do.

45:23.521 --> 45:25.488
[crowing]

45:25.490 --> 45:27.356
- Bye!
- Bye, Peter!

45:27.358 --> 45:29.726
- See ya soon!
- Happy crackers!

45:29.728 --> 45:32.695
If you ever need me,
you know how to call me.

45:34.264 --> 45:36.365
Farewell,
good ship <i>Buccaneer.</i>

45:36.367 --> 45:40.236
I'm glad you're back with the
best crew on the Never Sea.

45:40.238 --> 45:41.771
Aw, don't worry, Bucky.

45:41.773 --> 45:44.807
I'll be back. Someday.

45:44.809 --> 45:47.643
'Till then, smooth sailin'.

45:48.712 --> 45:50.713
- Yeah!
- Hooray!

45:50.715 --> 45:53.049
- Awesome!
- Woo-hoo!

45:56.320 --> 45:57.954
[Hook] Oh, that was horrible.

45:57.956 --> 45:59.689
It was deplorable.

45:59.691 --> 46:01.257
It was absolutely...

46:01.259 --> 46:03.459
...un-adorable.

46:03.461 --> 46:06.496
Oh, imagine.
Winning and losing a ship

46:06.498 --> 46:08.498
all in one day.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.868
Now, now, cap'n,
tomorrow is another day.

46:11.870 --> 46:15.338
Perhaps we can find another
scroll about another race

46:15.340 --> 46:17.774
where we can win
another fun prize,

46:17.776 --> 46:20.676
like a new dinghy or
a fish-floatie or...

46:20.678 --> 46:24.447
But I don't want a dinghy
or a fish-floatie!

46:24.449 --> 46:26.349
Oh, dear.

46:28.385 --> 46:30.186
[shouts]

46:30.188 --> 46:33.689
[screaming]

46:33.691 --> 46:35.758
Ahoy, Cap'n Codfish.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.360
Pan!

46:37.362 --> 46:38.895
Need a little help?

46:38.897 --> 46:42.932
I shall never accept help
from the likes of you!

46:42.934 --> 46:45.701
Suit yourself.
Happy flying.

46:45.703 --> 46:47.937
Oh, that's right.

46:47.939 --> 46:50.173
You can't fly!

46:50.175 --> 46:52.575
[screaming]

46:55.679 --> 46:58.014
[spluttering]

46:58.016 --> 47:00.616
He's all yours,
Tick Tock Croc.

47:00.618 --> 47:02.351
[screaming]

47:03.921 --> 47:06.489
- [Peter laughing]
- [Hook screaming]

47:10.627 --> 47:12.929
<i>¶ Who wants to play belay </i>

47:18.769 --> 47:20.903
<i>¶ Belay </i>

47:21.505 --> 47:23.339
Ha-ha-har!

47:26.710 --> 47:28.644
<i>¶ Belay </i>

47:28.646 --> 47:30.546
<i>¶ There's a pirate game</i>
<i>that we like to play ¶</i>

47:30.548 --> 47:32.815
<i>¶ With a buccaneer</i>
<i>birthday crew ¶</i>

47:32.817 --> 47:36.452
<i>¶ It's a scurvy jig with</i>
<i>a start and stoppin' too ¶</i>

47:36.454 --> 47:38.721
<i>¶ It's like a cakewalk</i>
<i>but with a pirate rock ¶</i>

47:38.723 --> 47:40.690
<i>¶ So you dance till</i>
<i>it's time to freeze ¶</i>

47:40.692 --> 47:44.861
<i>¶ So listen for the word</i>
<i>that's "stop" in sailor-ese ¶</i>

47:44.863 --> 47:46.529
<i>¶ What could it be </i>

47:46.531 --> 47:49.265
What is that old pirate-y
word that means stop?

47:50.868 --> 47:53.069
<i>¶ Belay </i>

47:53.071 --> 47:54.770
That's right, matey,
when you hear that word,

47:54.772 --> 47:58.140
no matter how crazy
a jig you're jiggin',
you gotta freeze!

47:58.809 --> 48:00.710
<i>¶ Belay </i>

48:00.712 --> 48:02.745
<i>¶ So you can jump in</i>
<i>like a dolphin ¶</i>

48:02.747 --> 48:04.380
¶ Or spin like a whirly-pool

48:04.382 --> 48:05.748
<i>- ¶ Oh </i>
<i>- ¶ You can flap around </i>

48:05.750 --> 48:07.516
<i>¶ Like a fish who's</i>
<i>late for school ¶</i>

48:08.952 --> 48:10.953
<i>¶ Like a Tick Tock Croc</i>
<i>with lots of teeth ¶</i>

48:10.955 --> 48:12.855
<i>¶ Or a jumpin' jellyfish</i>
<i>off the reef ¶</i>

48:12.857 --> 48:16.158
<i>¶ It's a pirate pogo party</i>
<i>out to sea ¶</i>

48:17.027 --> 48:18.728
<i>¶ Overboard </i>

48:18.730 --> 48:21.264
<i>¶ Everybody play </i>

48:21.266 --> 48:22.765
<i>¶ Throw the anchor</i>
<i>over, matey ¶</i>

48:22.767 --> 48:24.901
<i>¶ Stop just when we say </i>

48:24.903 --> 48:27.003
<i>¶ Overboard </i>

48:27.005 --> 48:29.138
<i>¶ Everybody play </i>

48:29.140 --> 48:30.806
<i>¶ Throw the anchor</i>
<i>over, matey ¶</i>

48:30.808 --> 48:32.408
<i>¶ When you hear belay </i>

48:33.844 --> 48:35.678
<i>¶ 'Cause it's a party</i>
<i>me hearty ¶</i>

48:35.680 --> 48:37.647
¶ And we ain't standin' still

48:37.649 --> 48:39.715
<i>¶ We're gonna row this boat</i>
<i>right of the map ¶</i>

48:39.717 --> 48:41.617
<i>¶ We're gonna</i>
<i>rock the boat until ¶</i>

48:41.619 --> 48:43.853
<i>¶ 'Cause it's a buccaneer</i>
<i>birthday party ¶</i>

48:43.855 --> 48:45.821
<i>¶ All along the promenade </i>

48:45.823 --> 48:47.823
<i>¶ We're gonna stomp the deck</i>
<i>and celebrate ¶</i>

48:47.825 --> 48:49.825
<i>- ¶ Until we hear... </i>
<i>- ¶ Be... </i>

48:49.827 --> 48:51.861
-  <i>¶ ... you say </i>
<i>- I haven't said it yet.</i>

48:51.863 --> 48:53.629
- ¶ You say
- I haven't said it yet.

48:53.631 --> 48:56.165
- ¶ You say
- I haven't said it yet.

48:56.167 --> 48:58.134
<i>¶ Overboard </i>

48:58.136 --> 49:00.303

49:00.305 --> 49:01.938
<i>¶ Throw the anchor</i>

49:01.940 --> 49:03.172
<i>¶ Stop just when we say </i>

49:03.174 --> 49:06.008
<i>-</i> [scatting]
<i>- ¶ Overboard </i>

49:06.010 --> 49:08.377
<i>- ¶ Everybody play </i>

49:08.379 --> 49:09.979
<i>¶ Throw the anchor</i>

49:09.981 --> 49:12.281
<i>¶ When you hear us say... </i>

49:16.920 --> 49:18.020
Wait for it.

49:19.389 --> 49:20.823
<i>¶ Belay </i>
