00:02.253 --> 00:03.914
NARRATOR:
There is a town in Maine...

00:04.046 --> 00:05.001
I'd like a room.

00:05.089 --> 00:06.169
GRANNY: Welcome to Storybrooke.

00:06.257 --> 00:09.715
...where every storybook character
youâ€™ve ever known...

00:09.802 --> 00:11.793
-(GASPS)
-is trapped between two worlds.

00:11.929 --> 00:15.046
An evil queen sent a bunch
of fairy tale characters here?

00:15.224 --> 00:17.055
And now they don't remember
who they are.

00:17.143 --> 00:18.974
NARRATOR:
Victims of a powerful curse.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.050
Everything you love,

00:20.146 --> 00:21.886
everything all of you love,

00:21.981 --> 00:23.346
will be taken from you.

00:23.441 --> 00:25.227
NARRATOR: Only one knows the truth,

00:25.318 --> 00:27.934
and only one can break her spell.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.064
It's your destiny.

00:29.155 --> 00:30.270
You're gonna bring back
the happy endings.

00:30.656 --> 00:31.987
You enjoy your stay.

00:45.671 --> 00:49.255
You know, you had that same look
on your face before we bought it, too.

00:49.342 --> 00:52.129
You couldn't see past the ugly
windmill on the lawn,

00:52.261 --> 00:54.092
and said you'd never buy
an old lady house.

00:55.306 --> 00:58.048
Do you remember what made you
change your mind?

00:59.602 --> 01:00.808
Well, I see the windmill's gone.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.103
Come on. Everyone's waiting.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.314
Who's everyone?

01:12.156 --> 01:13.236
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

01:16.244 --> 01:17.199
-This is Jay.
-Good to see you.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.275
David.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.781
How are you doing?

01:20.498 --> 01:21.954
And this is Ellen, his wife.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.032
-Ellen, hi.
-Pleased to meet you, too.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.161
MAN: Welcome home, David.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.242
Hey.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.540
-Hey.
-Dr. Whale.

01:28.631 --> 01:29.711
-Hi, David.
-Hi.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.882
Look, I know this is
a lot, but it's good for you.

01:32.969 --> 01:35.802
The smallest thing could trigger
your memories. Just try and have fun.

01:36.514 --> 01:40.132
Thank you, Dr. Whale.
(SIGHS) I'll do my best.

01:41.269 --> 01:45.137
You know why he doesn't remember?
The curse isn't working on him yet.

01:46.232 --> 01:48.894
Henry, David has amnesia.

01:49.068 --> 01:52.060
Which is preventing the curse
from replacing his fairy tale story

01:52.154 --> 01:53.985
with fake memories.

01:54.949 --> 01:58.157
Right. Because everyone here has
fake stories that prevent them

01:58.244 --> 01:59.575
from remembering who they really are.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.823
Right. And now's our chance
to help him.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.529
We just have to get him to remember
that he...

02:03.624 --> 02:05.160
He's Prince Charming.

02:05.376 --> 02:06.616
We just have to jog his memory

02:06.711 --> 02:08.667
by getting him
and Ms. Blanchard together.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.577
Didn't we just try that?

02:10.881 --> 02:12.542
And it woke him up.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.252
Hey.

02:15.428 --> 02:16.508
You're the ones who saved me, right?

02:17.305 --> 02:18.886
Oh. Yeah, I guess.

02:19.098 --> 02:21.339
And you're also the only ones
I know here.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.140
You can hide with us.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.933
Fantastic. Thank you.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.021
So, you ever use a sword?

02:29.150 --> 02:31.357
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry?

02:33.446 --> 02:35.687
Emma, you live with Mary Margaret,
right?

02:36.991 --> 02:38.572
You know if she's coming tonight?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.819
No, she couldn't make it.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.244
You should go out there.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.537
There's plenty of food. Go.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.169
Be with your husband.

02:53.299 --> 02:56.166
I lost him once. Now I have him back.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.216
But it's like I still don't have him back.

02:59.138 --> 03:02.050
You have no idea how that feels.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.014
Actually, I do.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.259
I lost someone once, too.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.978
-Really?
-Yes.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.890
But the love I lost,
there's no bringing him back.

03:15.821 --> 03:19.359
You have a chance here. Go to him.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.399
You're right.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.363
And, Regina, thank you.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.165
Thank you for being such a good friend.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.743
It's been so lonely,
I'm not used to having one.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.544
Neither am I.

03:36.008 --> 03:39.045
Well, like it or not, you have one now.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.349
Have you seen David?

03:47.436 --> 03:48.471
Uh...

03:48.562 --> 03:49.551
He...

03:50.022 --> 03:51.432
No.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.734
Did you not get the invite?

04:01.492 --> 04:02.481
David!

04:04.286 --> 04:05.275
Here.

04:20.136 --> 04:23.628
So I heard you resigned from
the hospital. Was it me?

04:25.975 --> 04:28.261
Because of what I told you.

04:28.477 --> 04:32.061
About how I felt. About you.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.685
Come on. Don't tell me it's one-sided.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.893
You're married. It should be no-sided.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.604
What it should be doesn't matter.

04:42.491 --> 04:46.575
Whoever married Kathryn,
it's not me. I didn't choose her.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.244
l'm choosing you.

04:52.668 --> 04:55.501
I know you feel it. I can tell.

04:57.173 --> 04:59.164
I know you think that we have
this connection,

04:59.258 --> 05:04.628
but maybe it's because I happen to be
the person who saved your life.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.682
So why don't we leave it at that?

05:16.567 --> 05:17.682
(GROWLING)

05:20.488 --> 05:22.024
(BOTH GRUNTING)

05:24.575 --> 05:25.690
Ah!

06:00.236 --> 06:02.648
Next time, make sure I'm really dead.

06:09.453 --> 06:10.909
(PEOPLE CLAPPING)

06:13.916 --> 06:15.326
Well done.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.875
Well done? There's an understatement.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.921
Did you see what my son did
to that brute?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.461
He just killed the unkillable.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.928
A valiant feat for sure.
But it is still just a man.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.807
Can he do the same with a dragon?

06:31.267 --> 06:34.509
Do fairies sprinkle dust?
Do trolls live under bridges?

06:34.603 --> 06:38.391
Father, relax. I can kill
whatever beast you set after me.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.815
My kingdom is plagued by a dragon
like nothing you've ever faced before.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.230
He has killed every warrior
that's tried to slay him.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.606
He's yet to face me.

06:46.282 --> 06:47.943
My kingdom needs
this threat vanquished.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.946
And my kingdom needs gold.
I'm sure we can work something out.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.831
Careful. Remember what happened
to Frederick.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.212
Your sword.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.514
Consider it a down payment.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.979
You'll get the rest when you
deliver the dragon's head to me.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.809
It's a deal. Forgive me if
I refuse to shake on it, King Midas.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.320
(LAUGHING)

07:29.992 --> 07:32.654
Come. Let's discuss the details.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.454
A toast to our fearless Prince!

07:36.540 --> 07:37.575
(ALL CHEERING)

07:37.666 --> 07:40.203
No. There's no celebrating today.

07:41.211 --> 07:45.329
This was but a simple test.
The task before us is too big,

07:45.841 --> 07:47.422
too important to make light of.

07:48.093 --> 07:51.085
Just because I was easily able
to kill this brute doesn't mean...

08:14.244 --> 08:16.405
Goodbye, my son.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.789
Your Majesty, there is no time to grieve.

08:28.300 --> 08:33.010
lf Midas learns he is dead, he will
find another warrior to slay his dragon.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.924
And we will never see an ounce
of his gold.

08:35.349 --> 08:39.137
Yes. Yes. The kingdom must survive.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.014
So what are we to do?

08:41.939 --> 08:45.022
l have asked for help.
It should be here soon.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.565
Oh, it's here.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.235
Leave us.

08:51.782 --> 08:52.862
SOLDIER: Move.

08:54.660 --> 08:59.529
So this is how you treat my gifts?
You really must be more careful.

08:59.665 --> 09:03.032
He was not a gift. He was my son.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.659
A son I gave you.

09:06.296 --> 09:10.084
In a deal we made.
You did me no favors.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.211
Yes. Yes, I did.

09:12.302 --> 09:15.635
Shame you and the Queen couldn't
conceive a child on your own.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.097
My price for that was a pittance.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.220
But now that she is gone, well,

09:21.311 --> 09:25.600
I assume that conceiving another
heir is out of the question,

09:25.691 --> 09:27.522
let alone a dragon slayer.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.736
Then let's do another deal.

09:30.446 --> 09:31.936
Bring him back.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.153
I need my son to do this.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.943
I'll give you anything.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.112
Anything?

09:38.454 --> 09:39.864
What do you want?

09:39.955 --> 09:42.367
There's a magic wand I desire.

09:42.583 --> 09:47.327
It belongs to a certain Fairy Godmother
who's patron to your family.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.711
I want to know her whereabouts.

09:51.633 --> 09:56.673
Done. Now tell me. How do I bring
my son back to slay the dragon?

09:56.972 --> 10:01.341
Bring him back? No, that's out
of the question. He's dead.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.141
Magic can do much, but not that.

10:04.146 --> 10:05.135
But you just said...

10:05.230 --> 10:06.970
Nothing about resurrection.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.397
Then my kingdom is lost.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.229
I'm alone.

10:16.909 --> 10:20.493
Oh, dear. Oh, dearie, dearie, dear.

10:21.830 --> 10:26.369
Did I not tell you that I could have
your son slay the dragon?

10:27.336 --> 10:31.204
And am I not a man of my word?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.799
I thought you said he was gone forever!

10:32.883 --> 10:34.123
Oh, that he is.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.796
But his brother...

10:36.887 --> 10:38.718
His what?

10:38.806 --> 10:40.842
His twin brother.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.683
Did I not mention there was another?

10:44.770 --> 10:45.759
(LAUGHS)

11:00.661 --> 11:03.368
You might want to ease up or that
Brillo Pad's gonna press charges.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.993
The dishes were just piling up.

11:07.084 --> 11:10.042
This have anything to do with
David stopping by?

11:10.754 --> 11:12.995
I saw him sulking away as I pulled up.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.916
Wejust... Hejust...

11:17.010 --> 11:20.753
I know what your both "just."
And you did the right thing.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.838
He made a pretty compelling case.

11:22.933 --> 11:26.425
But he's still married. I know.
I was just at the party.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.272
What do I do?

11:29.481 --> 11:31.893
You need to stop cleaning
and have a drink.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.817
Here's the thing. I don't know a lot
about relationships,

11:43.912 --> 11:45.618
other than having many that failed.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.747
But generally speaking,

11:50.919 --> 11:54.332
if you think something you wanna
do is wrong,

11:56.258 --> 11:57.839
it is.

12:00.178 --> 12:04.091
So you gotta stay strong,
and he has to figure out his life.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.935
Cheers.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.191
KATHRYN: You look different.

12:26.204 --> 12:29.492
Your hair. It's longer.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.788
You used to always have a buzz cut.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.955
You used to complain that long hair
was itchy and hard to take care of.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.799
I guess it grew while I was in there.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.972
So, I was gonna go to bed.
Do you want to join me?

12:47.684 --> 12:52.678
You mean "go to bed" go to bed
or "go to bed"?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.767
Whatever you want.

12:58.362 --> 13:02.071
Why don't we just sit
and talk some more?

13:14.086 --> 13:15.292
This...

13:18.256 --> 13:19.416
...isn't right.

13:25.514 --> 13:30.508
This way. Come on. Come. Come on.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.225
Hey.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.064
Ah!

13:42.197 --> 13:43.778
Didn't see that coming, did you?

13:43.907 --> 13:45.363
Honey!

13:45.450 --> 13:47.987
Mother, how was the market?

13:48.203 --> 13:50.535
It was interesting.

13:51.707 --> 13:55.700
Interesting? Normally you come back
cursing the prices.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.284
Oh, well, that's still the case.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.664
In there.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.550
But this time, I had a very
interesting talk with the grain merchant.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.839
Grain? We don't need any grain.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.053
He has a daughter.
She's ready for marriage.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.598
He thinks the two of you would
make a great couple.

14:11.685 --> 14:12.970
Mother!

14:13.061 --> 14:15.518
I know, I know. I hate myself
for even bringing it up.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.062
Let me guess? She has a dowry
that would save the farm?

14:18.233 --> 14:20.474
We are running out of options.

14:20.569 --> 14:25.484
Mother, please. As poor as we are,
love is one thing I can afford.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.658
I will find a way to save this farm.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.736
But I won't do it by marrying for riches.

14:32.914 --> 14:33.903
When I marry,

14:33.999 --> 14:35.034
I want it to be

14:35.125 --> 14:38.993
because I choose to spend
the rest of my life with someone I love.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.757
When are you going to learn?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.253
You can't have everything.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.380
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Well, perhaps he can.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.099
(CHUCKLES EVILLY)

14:55.270 --> 14:58.262
A twin brother?
And you gave him to that man?

15:00.484 --> 15:02.645
We were poor, barely surviving.

15:03.361 --> 15:07.570
Then he came along with an offer.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.357
One of you for the farm.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.862
Why didn't you ever tell me?

15:11.953 --> 15:14.660
The deal forbade us from ever
speaking of it.

15:14.748 --> 15:18.582
Your father regretted the decision
the minute that man took your brother.

15:19.211 --> 15:21.202
He carried the guilt with him
to his grave.

15:23.840 --> 15:28.083
Hate to interrupt this tender moment.
Time is of the essence.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.136
Mother, wait in the house
while I deal with this.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.305
What do you want from me?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.307
Not me, dear. The King.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.724
He needs a Prince to slay a dragon.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.276
I'm not a dragon slayer.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.194
No, but your brother was.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.986
This newfound kinship will be
your salvation.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.493
Simply play the part.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.833
The King's knights will take care of
everything else.

15:59.292 --> 16:03.501
All you must do is deliver
the dragon's head to Midas.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.501
What's in it for you?

16:07.425 --> 16:08.961
What's in it for me is my business.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.509
You should be asking yourself
what's in it for you.

16:11.847 --> 16:14.338
You do this, your poor mother...

16:14.558 --> 16:15.968
Well, the King is gonna make sure

16:16.059 --> 16:18.300
she never wants for anything
ever again.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.687
Your farm will be saved.
And you, should you survive,

16:22.816 --> 16:25.057
you shall come home
the conquering hero.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.196
Now don't tell me you don't want that.

16:36.872 --> 16:39.454
Oh, everyone has a choice, dearie.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.408
Just make sure it's the right one.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.922
I'm a hell of a doctor, huh?

16:54.389 --> 16:56.721
No way he wakes up on
someone else's watch.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.474
Hello, Dr. Whale.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.768
So I heard that you resigned from
the hospital.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.390
I hope it wasn't because of me.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.935
Why would it be because of you?

17:06.026 --> 17:09.063
Well, our date. I never called you after.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.604
Yeah. I know. I know, it's not classy.
And I'm sorry.

17:13.825 --> 17:18.034
But if you can find a way to get over it,
you know where to find me.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.995
Have a good day.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.081
Ms. Blanchard, may I have a word?

17:33.553 --> 17:34.838
Of course.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.551
I wanted to talk to you
about my friend, Kathryn.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.722
But more specifically, I wanted to
talk to you about her husband, David.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.597
You don't belong together.

17:46.942 --> 17:50.400
He's not yours. He's taken.
Find somebody else.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.852
I haven't done anything.

17:51.947 --> 17:55.064
Really? So he just up and left
his wife on a whim?

17:56.785 --> 17:57.900
He did What?

17:58.745 --> 17:59.780
You don't know.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.831
Well, I suspect you soon will.

18:05.043 --> 18:09.377
So listen carefully, dear,
because it's in your best interest.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.706
Stay away. He's in a fragile state.

18:12.801 --> 18:15.417
He doesn't know who he is
or what he's doing.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.094
And you're this close
to wrecking multiple lives.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.094
So before you do something
that can't be undone,

18:27.023 --> 18:29.765
let him remember who he was.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.125
There he is. Our savior!

18:47.043 --> 18:49.159
The man who is going to tear
the dragon limb from limb.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.548
You do this and you'll be a legend.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.980
Here, let me.

19:12.861 --> 19:16.570
You fastened it wrong.
Here, give me that.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.022
How will I fight?
How will I protect myself?

19:19.242 --> 19:22.780
You won't. You will stay outside
the cave while we kill the dragon.

19:23.038 --> 19:26.155
If you don't come out of this alive,
Midas won't give our kingdom any gold.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.662
You might have the title of hero,
but not the job.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.959
(DRAGON SCREECHING)

19:58.740 --> 20:01.197
The dragon's lair is through there.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.114
You stay here. We'll be back.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.371
Did you know him well?

20:13.463 --> 20:14.578
Who?

20:14.672 --> 20:17.379
My brother, the Prince.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.254
Yeah, we knew him.
He was the bravest man I ever met.

-(DRAGON SCREECHES)
-(MAN SCREAMING)

20:22.847 --> 20:23.927
They need our help.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.552
We stay here. Our orders are clear.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.927
-People are dying!
-Don't move! Stay back!

20:31.272 --> 20:32.398
Hey!

20:57.757 --> 20:58.837
Where's your sword?

21:03.304 --> 21:04.464
(SCREAMING)

21:08.893 --> 21:10.394
Stay here. Stay.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.804
Didn't see that coming, did you?

22:06.910 --> 22:09.196
Careful. Looks sharp.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.277
You can't be here.

22:12.207 --> 22:13.196
I needed to see you.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.075
Tell me you didn't leave your wife
because of me.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.169
I do not want to destroy your marriage.

22:20.256 --> 22:24.295
You're not. It's me.
I don't want to hurt her either.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.797
But the most hurtful thing to Kathryn
would be me pretending.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.932
She needs someone to feel about her

22:31.976 --> 22:33.557
the way I feel about you.

22:35.522 --> 22:40.516
I'm really trying hard to stay away
from you. To do the right thing.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.441
Why is that the right thing?

22:42.570 --> 22:43.559
Because you already have a life.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.065
With someone I didn't choose.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.236
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

22:46.324 --> 22:50.738
The man who chose that life,
whoever married Kathryn, is gone.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.912
The man here wants someone else.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.949
You really have to leave me alone.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.079
Is that truly what you want?

22:59.170 --> 23:00.751
Go.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.830
Meet me tonight. At least think about it.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.583
I'll be at the bridge
where you found me at 8:00.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.175
Think about it until then
and then decide.

23:08.263 --> 23:11.881
If you don't show, I'll know.
And I'll never bother you again.

23:14.602 --> 23:19.346
But if you choose this, if you choose us,

23:23.194 --> 23:24.400
you know where I'll be.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.909
Sometimes the clichÃ©s are true.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.749
Okay. What do you want?

23:46.301 --> 23:48.508
Remember when I said no night shifts?

23:48.970 --> 23:51.712
I need you to work tonight.
Just this once.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.258
VVhy?

23:53.349 --> 23:56.386
I volunteer at an animal shelter
and the supervisor's sick

23:56.477 --> 23:58.889
and someone needs to feed the dogs.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.308
Very lucky you bought a bear claw.

24:03.818 --> 24:04.933
Emma, can I talk to you for a minute?

24:06.195 --> 24:08.186
I'll just go patrol my office.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.230
Thanks.

24:14.829 --> 24:17.821
He left his wife. David. He left her.
He left Kathryn!

24:17.915 --> 24:18.995
Okay, slow down.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.492
He did it for me. He wants me to be with
him. He wants me to meet him tonight.

24:22.587 --> 24:23.576
That's...

24:23.671 --> 24:27.255
I mean, I'm trying so hard to be
strong, but he just keeps coming.

24:27.342 --> 24:28.957
I mean, how do I stop it?

24:29.260 --> 24:31.421
You know, how do I let him down?
What would you do?

24:31.512 --> 24:32.672
I'd go.

24:33.348 --> 24:34.337
What?

24:34.515 --> 24:38.383
Well, he left her. It's one thing to
say that he wants you,

24:38.478 --> 24:42.221
but it's another to actually make
a choice, and now he has.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.180
That's all you can ask for.

24:46.361 --> 24:48.943
Given her new friendship with Kathryn,
I don't think Regina would be happy.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.275
All the more reason to do it.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.575
Good Lord, is this really happening?

24:57.246 --> 24:58.622
You tell me.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.438
He has done it.
Everything you asked for and more.

and prevailed.

and the Mapinguari.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.076
(WHISPERS)
We did it. We pulled it off.

25:43.167 --> 25:46.034
Yes. Now how much longer
before I can return home?

25:46.129 --> 25:47.744
That's a discussion not for now.

25:50.842 --> 25:52.002
From this day forth,

25:52.218 --> 25:54.049
may that beast's head
be a reminder to us

25:54.137 --> 25:56.344
of the valiant warrior who killed it.

25:56.431 --> 25:59.468
The bravest, most noble Prince
l have ever met.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.175
You have earned my utmost respect.

26:03.062 --> 26:07.055
We treasure that respect, King Midas,
just as we respect your treasure.

26:07.692 --> 26:11.059
Yes, yes. You were promised gold,
and gold you shall have.

26:11.654 --> 26:14.236
But I did not get to where I am
by thinking small.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.240
I stand before you now
because I dared to dream big.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.069
l was notjust looking for
a dragon slayer.

26:21.164 --> 26:23.075
l was looking for the strongest
warrior in the land.

26:23.499 --> 26:26.616
A hero. Someone who could
unite the kingdoms.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.501
Someone I would be proud
to call family.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.420
Bring her.

26:36.471 --> 26:37.961
Gentlemen,

26:40.016 --> 26:43.804
may I present my daughter, Abigail.

26:45.813 --> 26:50.807
Beyond gold, beyond anything,
I value her most.

26:51.819 --> 26:54.435
I promised her I would only give
her hand in marriage

26:54.530 --> 26:57.397
when I could find a companion
worthy of her.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.156
And now, I have.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.071
He killed the dragon?

27:03.873 --> 27:05.113
I guess he'll do.

27:06.042 --> 27:10.376
And so, Prince James, I offer you
my daughter's hand in marriage.

27:10.546 --> 27:14.038
King Midas, I am humbled
by your generous offer,

27:14.133 --> 27:15.248
but I can't honestly say I'm...

27:15.343 --> 27:18.005
My son! Always so humble.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.091
(WHISPERS)
If you say anything but yes,

27:21.182 --> 27:23.218
you will be responsible
for the destruction

27:23.309 --> 27:26.176
of everyone and everything
in our kingdom.

27:27.271 --> 27:32.265
You will marry this girl, or I will
kill you. lwill kill your mother.

27:32.735 --> 27:37.229
I will turn that farm to ash.
Do you understand me?

27:40.201 --> 27:44.035
I'll take your silence for wisdom.
Follow it.

27:44.789 --> 27:45.949
I know you'll make the right decision.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.337
-Mr. Nolan?
-Oh!

28:00.805 --> 28:02.045
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

28:02.181 --> 28:06.424
l was just heading home from work
and I saw you. Are you lost?

28:06.936 --> 28:10.599
Yeah. Yeah, kind of.
I'm looking for the toll bridge.

28:10.898 --> 28:14.390
Ah! Where you were found.
Trying to jog your memory?

28:14.902 --> 28:16.563
No, I'm meeting someone.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.187
So you've made your choice?

28:22.368 --> 28:23.528
Yes.

28:24.412 --> 28:27.199
Well, I don't suppose I can convince
you to change your mind?

28:29.250 --> 28:30.456
I can't change what I feel.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.329
No, of course not.

28:34.589 --> 28:37.205
Walk down the street to Mr. Gold's
pawn shop.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.591
You'll find a fork in the road. Go left.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.178
It'll take you to a hiking trail
that leads directly to the bridge.

28:44.265 --> 28:46.927
Thank you. For understanding.

28:47.018 --> 28:48.224
Good luck, David.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.564
I hope you find what you're looking for.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.147
Hello?

29:52.792 --> 29:53.827
Hello?

30:13.187 --> 30:14.347
GOLD: Charming.

30:15.439 --> 30:16.895
I'm sorry?

30:16.983 --> 30:19.019
The mobile. Isn't it charming?

30:20.528 --> 30:23.941
Exquisitely designed.
Masterfully crafted.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.109
I can get it down if you like.

30:26.200 --> 30:30.944
No, no, I mean, it's very nice, but
actually I'm looking for the toll bridge.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.370
The Mayor said there was a fork
in the road by your shop, but...

30:33.624 --> 30:35.455
Seems Ms. Mills has led you astray.

30:35.543 --> 30:38.410
Yeah. Yeah, you'd think the Mayor
would know her own town.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.291
One would think.

30:43.384 --> 30:46.876
Out of the door, turn right, two blocks
you'll find the trail. Can't miss it.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.302
Thank you.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.175
See something you like?

30:54.520 --> 30:56.385
Where did you get that?

30:56.981 --> 30:58.266
That old thing?

30:58.733 --> 31:02.521
That's been gathering dust for forever.

31:12.705 --> 31:13.694
I think...

31:16.917 --> 31:18.657
...this belonged to me.

31:18.919 --> 31:22.878
Really? Are you sure?

31:23.758 --> 31:24.747
Yes.

31:29.346 --> 31:30.597
I remember.

31:49.784 --> 31:50.773
Mother.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.943
Oh, you're back! You're alive!

31:54.205 --> 31:55.945
-Yes.
-Oh! Oh!

31:56.040 --> 31:57.029
I did it.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.906
Are you hurt? I've been so worried.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.620
I'm fine, Mother. Really.

32:00.711 --> 32:06.251
Look at you. Look at you!
You look like...

32:07.009 --> 32:10.467
Like a... Oh, you look like a prince.

32:11.055 --> 32:14.673
Come inside. I'll make us some supper.
You should see the house, the farm.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.600
The King is going to take care of us.
He's already started...

32:19.814 --> 32:22.351
What? What's wrong?

32:24.193 --> 32:25.308
(SIGHS)

32:29.031 --> 32:31.397
Midas wants to unite the kingdoms.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.783
By marrying me to his daughter.

32:35.830 --> 32:36.819
What?

32:38.374 --> 32:40.740
It makes the grain merchant's dowry
look like sheep dung.

32:41.168 --> 32:42.157
No.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.922
You were right to turn down that offer,
as you must this one, too.

32:48.259 --> 32:51.592
Every day you've been gone has
shown me it was shameful of me

32:51.679 --> 32:53.169
to ever encourage you othenNise.

32:53.514 --> 32:58.383
Your freedom to choose is more
important than anything.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.812
-l'll give up the farm.
-No.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.102
They can't force you.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.520
Yes, they can.

33:04.024 --> 33:07.187
And because of our ruse, Midas can
never really know who I am, which...

33:10.281 --> 33:12.442
We can't ever see each other again.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.027
Yes.

33:18.289 --> 33:20.029
Then don't do it. Run away.

33:20.124 --> 33:22.331
I can't. They will kill you.

33:22.585 --> 33:25.292
I lose you either way.
At least I'll know you'll be happy.

33:25.379 --> 33:27.119
I already accepted Midas' offer.

33:30.134 --> 33:31.965
I didn't come here for advice, Mother.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.218
I came here to say goodbye.

33:42.438 --> 33:43.769
There's too much at stake.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.431
I couldn't let the kingdom suffer
on my account.

33:48.277 --> 33:50.484
I couldn't let them hurt you.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.319
You were right about one thing.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.653
I can't have everything.

34:02.499 --> 34:05.912
My boy. My sweet, sweet boy.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.003
Give this to your wife to be.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.581
Mother, I don't love her.
I don't even know her.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.041
I can't take this.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.171
Just because you don't know her

34:15.262 --> 34:17.844
doesn't mean
you won't grow to love her.

34:17.932 --> 34:21.265
True love follows this ring
wherever it goes, my son.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.725
I had it with your father.

34:23.979 --> 34:26.470
I've had it as your mother.

34:26.941 --> 34:30.024
-Now you will have it. Take it.
-No. No.

34:30.110 --> 34:35.104
Take it, and I'll know,
even if I never see you again,

34:37.326 --> 34:42.070
I'll know you'll find love.
I'll know you'll be happy.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.600
You came.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.310
You sound surprised.

35:11.402 --> 35:14.485
In fact, you almost sound
a bit disappointed.

35:14.905 --> 35:16.145
I remember.

35:18.242 --> 35:19.277
Kathryn?

35:23.455 --> 35:24.661
Everything.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.164
And you love her.

35:36.427 --> 35:38.008
I don't know.

35:38.387 --> 35:42.005
But I know I did.
I remember how I felt. And...

35:43.559 --> 35:45.345
I think I have to honor that.

35:47.021 --> 35:48.352
And everything that you said to me...

35:48.439 --> 35:53.149
ls true. I do have feelings for you.
Intense feelings.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.897
Feelings I don't quite understand.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.111
You're going back to her.

35:58.449 --> 36:00.360
It's the right thing to do.

36:05.247 --> 36:09.661
"The right thing to do"
was not to lead me on.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.419
I know.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.582
So you've made your choice.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.677
-l'm sorry.
-That's okay.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.847
I guess itjust wasn't meant to be.

37:02.888 --> 37:03.968
(GRUNTING)

37:08.268 --> 37:09.804
This is volunteering?

37:10.771 --> 37:13.763
Plans changed. Regina needed me to...

37:13.857 --> 37:14.937
Sleep with her?

37:15.025 --> 37:16.060
No.

37:19.696 --> 37:23.154
Why were you
sneaking out the window?

37:23.659 --> 37:28.369
Because she didn't want Henry to know.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.158
You did this with Henry in the house?

37:31.250 --> 37:32.581
He's sleeping. He doesn't know.

37:33.669 --> 37:36.035
Oh, my God,
lwish lwas Henry right now.

37:37.548 --> 37:38.537
This is disgusting.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.503
I really do work at an animal shelter.

37:43.679 --> 37:47.137
You can finish my shift.
I'm done working nights.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.352
(RINGING)

38:09.329 --> 38:12.821
You were right.
I did hate that windmill out front.

38:14.293 --> 38:15.499
You remember.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.592
How much do you remember?

38:23.260 --> 38:24.340
Enough.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.214
I know we weren't at a good place
when I left.

38:28.432 --> 38:31.344
I know you thought I was leaving you,
but I wasn't.

38:31.435 --> 38:35.678
I wanted to work things out.
Ijust needed some time.

38:36.857 --> 38:38.267
Then I had my accident,

38:40.486 --> 38:43.193
and got much more time
than I expected.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.358
I'm sorry.

38:48.410 --> 38:49.775
I'm sorry, too.

38:53.207 --> 38:57.541
I know we have work to do.
Let's see what happens.

39:02.216 --> 39:03.706
I'd like that.

39:21.944 --> 39:24.651
MIDAS: Let this mark the beginning
of a new era,

39:24.738 --> 39:27.650
of a new kingdom, united and strong.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.073
An era of mutual prosperity.

39:31.370 --> 39:33.235
Abigail, James,

39:33.956 --> 39:37.119
as I stay to work out the particulars
of our new land with King George,

39:37.209 --> 39:39.245
go to your new home at my palace.

39:39.336 --> 39:42.999
We'll be along shortly. And the
celebration will be beyond your dreams.

39:43.090 --> 39:44.079
ABIGAIL: Thank you, Daddy.

39:46.260 --> 39:48.251
I trust that you know best.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.471
I'm glad you made
the right decision, Son.

40:02.317 --> 40:05.400
Thank you, Father.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.066
Come. I'm tired of waiting.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.576
Then ourjourney shall begin.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.530
I thought we might take
the scenic route.

40:20.294 --> 40:24.628
Smile, Son.
You're on the road to true love.

40:46.153 --> 40:48.018
ABIGAIL: I told you the Troll Road
would have been quicker.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.320
Are you even listening to me?

40:51.783 --> 40:52.818
MAN: Halt!

40:53.660 --> 40:55.696
There's something in the road.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.507
Rough day?

41:16.683 --> 41:18.344
Don't feel like talking.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.764
Come on, sometimes it's easier
to talk to someone

41:21.855 --> 41:24.187
when you don't give a crap
what they think.

41:31.365 --> 41:32.775
You ever walk into a situation

41:32.866 --> 41:35.357
where you know
exactly what's going to happen?

41:36.953 --> 41:39.160
And then you go into it anyway.

41:41.958 --> 41:44.745
And then
when what you were afraid of happens,

41:46.296 --> 41:49.709
you kick yourself
because you should have known better.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.835
But that's just who you are.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.008
So you keep punishing yourself.

42:00.602 --> 42:01.717
No.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.262
How do you do that?

42:06.024 --> 42:10.393
By never doing what's expected.
Keeps life interesting.

42:12.531 --> 42:13.941
Can I buy you a drink?

42:19.037 --> 42:20.152
You can buy me two.
