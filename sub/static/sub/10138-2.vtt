07:45.924 --> 07:48.343
Go? Oh, go!

07:48.385 --> 07:50.387
I thought you meant

07:48.385 --> 07:50.387
wee-wee go, I didn't..

07:51.679 --> 07:53.056
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.599
Okay, well, here, I'm going.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.310
I'm going. I'm almost gone.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.644
I'm gone.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.104
- Bye.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.104
- 'Bye-bye.'

08:28.133 --> 08:29.050
Shh.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.719
- Shh.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.719
- Good boy.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.931
- Stranger!

08:31.761 --> 08:34.931
- Ow! Ow!

08:34.973 --> 08:36.391
- Stranger!

08:34.973 --> 08:36.391
- 'No, no.'

08:36.433 --> 08:37.892
I'm not a stranger.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.892
I'm a friend.

08:37.934 --> 08:41.355
- I'm a friend.

08:37.934 --> 08:41.355
- Mr. Katsopolis.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.564
Miss Suzie.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.108
I was, I was just leaving.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.153
Uh, how did this table

08:45.150 --> 08:48.153
get on my back?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.071
Mr. Katsopolis, believe me

08:50.113 --> 08:51.531
I have been doing this

08:50.113 --> 08:51.531
a very long time.

08:51.572 --> 08:52.657
I'm sure, you have.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.202
Nicky and Alex

08:52.699 --> 08:55.202
are doing just fine

08:55.243 --> 08:59.164
and they really don't

08:55.243 --> 08:59.164
need you here, right now.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.540
They don't need me?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.001
They don't need their dad?

09:05.170 --> 09:06.587
(Jesse)

09:05.170 --> 09:06.587
'Did you see that?'

09:06.629 --> 09:08.215
That little ankle-biter

09:06.629 --> 09:08.215
stole that puzzle

09:08.256 --> 09:09.632
from my sweet little Alex.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.968
You know, Alex really

09:09.674 --> 09:11.968
doesn't seem to mind.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.637
Oh, sure, on the outside he's

09:12.010 --> 09:14.637
having fun playing and stuff.

09:14.679 --> 09:18.099
But inside the kid's crying

09:14.679 --> 09:18.099
like a, like a little baby.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.727
Just think of the effect it must

09:18.141 --> 09:20.727
be having on his little brother.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.396
Choo-choo!

09:23.813 --> 09:25.940
That was a cry for help.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.734
Listen, I-I think

09:25.982 --> 09:27.734
their mother was right.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.486
I-I just don't think

09:27.775 --> 09:29.486
they're ready.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.405
Come on, boys.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.405
It is time to say, bye-bye.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.780
Bye-bye, daddy.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.908
No, no.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.908
Not to me, hah.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.118
Now, listen, guys,

09:34.949 --> 09:37.118
we're going over the wall.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.079
Is school over, daddy?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.164
Well, it is for you guys.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.164
Come on. Hop on.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.751
Hop on, that's good.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.751
Here we go.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.294
Say goodbye to Miss Suzie.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.505
- Bye-bye, Miss Suzie.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.465
- Bye.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.465
- There we go.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.799
Come on.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.061
[instrumental music]

10:06.231 --> 10:09.484
Oh, Jess. I am so sorry.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.736
- Why? What'd you do?

10:09.526 --> 10:11.736
- I flipped out this morning.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.114
And I have been thinking

10:11.778 --> 10:14.114
about it and you were right.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.074
Nicky and Alex

10:14.155 --> 10:16.074
are ready for preschool.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.242
And I just have to accept that.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.454
Honey, thank you

10:17.284 --> 10:20.454
for being so strong.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.873
Well, well, gosh

10:20.495 --> 10:23.873
knows I was strong.

10:23.915 --> 10:27.627
But, uh, you know, honey,

10:23.915 --> 10:27.627
I-I-I think you were right.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.004
Oh, no. What happened?

10:27.668 --> 10:30.004
How was their first day?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.881
Just like them. Short.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.594
They got there, honey,

10:33.508 --> 10:35.594
and, quite frankly

10:35.635 --> 10:38.346
they, uh, they just

10:35.635 --> 10:38.346
weren't ready.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.307
Oh, Jess, I was afraid

10:38.388 --> 10:40.307
that this would happen.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.934
Yeah, well...hey, we gave

10:40.348 --> 10:42.934
it a shot, you know.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.395
But, listen, we'll try

10:42.976 --> 10:45.395
in a couple years, okay?

10:45.437 --> 10:47.021
Maybe when they're

10:45.437 --> 10:47.021
little more mature

10:47.063 --> 10:48.482
they're little more grown

10:48.523 --> 10:50.317
their, their sideburns fill in.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.235
A couple of years?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.653
Honey, what are

10:52.277 --> 10:53.653
we gonna do, they'll fall

10:53.694 --> 10:55.322
way behind the other kids?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.698
In what,

10:55.363 --> 10:57.698
Play-Doh comprehension?

10:57.740 --> 11:00.118
No, listen, honey, I got this

10:57.740 --> 11:00.118
whole thing figured out, okay?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.453
Joey and I we

11:00.160 --> 11:01.453
do the radio show

11:01.495 --> 11:03.204
but not until

11:01.495 --> 11:03.204
late afternoon, okay?

11:03.246 --> 11:05.873
I'm gonna teach the kids

11:03.246 --> 11:05.873
everything they need to learn

11:05.915 --> 11:07.750
right here in this house.

11:07.792 --> 11:12.755
Jess, you are not

11:07.792 --> 11:12.755
exactly Mr. Rogers.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.383
What's to know? You teach

11:12.797 --> 11:15.383
the kid a couple vowels.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.051
And then you teach

11:15.425 --> 11:17.051
him all the, uh..

11:17.093 --> 11:19.762
All the other letters

11:17.093 --> 11:19.762
that aren't vowels.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.057
And then you put a puppet

11:19.804 --> 11:23.057
on and-and that's it, it's fine.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.976
Honey, don't you think

11:23.099 --> 11:24.976
the kids should interact

11:25.018 --> 11:27.937
with other kids

11:25.018 --> 11:27.937
on their level?

11:27.979 --> 11:29.481
That's where Joey comes in.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.116
What a dump.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.452
Didn't dad tell

11:40.158 --> 11:42.452
you to clean up?

11:42.494 --> 11:43.828
Yes, he did.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.580
But he is just

11:43.870 --> 11:45.580
gonna have to understand

11:45.622 --> 11:47.706
that I'm old enough to keep

11:45.622 --> 11:47.706
this room the way I want.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.459
And you're gonna

11:47.748 --> 11:49.459
have to understand

11:49.501 --> 11:51.461
that you are not gonna

11:49.501 --> 11:51.461
be able to watch TV

11:51.503 --> 11:53.421
for the rest of your life.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.007
Oh, little Michelle.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.218
This might be just

11:56.049 --> 11:58.218
a bit over your head.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.760
When you're older,

11:58.259 --> 11:59.760
you'll understand.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.971
And when you're older,

11:59.802 --> 12:01.971
you still won't.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.018
Let me handle this.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.229
All our lives we've

12:07.060 --> 12:09.229
lived under dad's rules

12:09.270 --> 12:10.938
and what do we

12:09.270 --> 12:10.938
have to show for it?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.607
A nice house.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.732
Good food.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.109
A buck a week.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.320
Don't rock the boat.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.955
Michelle?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.249
Howdy, roomie.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.712
That's a funny thing for someone

12:30.791 --> 12:33.712
to say before they<i> leave.</i>

12:33.752 --> 12:36.631
I'm not leaving.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.631
Steph is a total slob.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.633
So, I decided

12:36.673 --> 12:38.633
to move in with you.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.093
The good sister.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.554
Oh, Stephanie's not bad.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.847
She's just becoming a teenager.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.224
It's a rough time.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.517
I went through it.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.893
'You're gonna go through it.'

12:48.935 --> 12:50.562
And take it from

12:48.935 --> 12:50.562
a voice of experience.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.564
The<i> best</i> place

12:50.604 --> 12:52.564
to go through it..

12:52.606 --> 12:53.898
...is in your own room.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.775
How about I go

12:53.940 --> 12:56.775
through it in your room?

12:56.817 --> 12:58.737
Michelle, I love you

12:58.777 --> 13:01.615
so I'm not gonna

12:58.777 --> 13:01.615
kick you out.

13:01.656 --> 13:02.990
Dad!

13:04.618 --> 13:07.621
Does dad have to get

13:04.618 --> 13:07.621
involved in this?

13:07.662 --> 13:09.080
Michelle, you're not

13:07.662 --> 13:09.080
moving in here.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.624
- Yes, I am.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.624
- No, you are not.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.333
- Yes, I am.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.333
- You have to go back in there.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.043
Hey, hey, hey.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.379
Okay, whoever was wrong last

13:14.085 --> 13:16.379
time, you're right, this time.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.465
Let's have dinner.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.551
You're always

13:18.506 --> 13:21.551
taking<i> her</i> side.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.844
Dad, Michelle thinks that

13:21.593 --> 13:23.844
just because Stephanie

13:23.886 --> 13:25.513
has turned into

13:23.886 --> 13:25.513
a little Miss Pigpen

13:25.555 --> 13:26.847
she can move in with me.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.224
Her room is still dirty?

13:28.266 --> 13:30.393
I distinctly told

13:28.266 --> 13:30.393
her to clean it up.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.187
Well, maybe you need

13:30.435 --> 13:33.187
to tell her more distinct-er.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.777
Dad, just go in there

13:36.357 --> 13:38.777
and yell at her.

13:38.817 --> 13:39.986
Lay down the law.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.655
That always worked with me.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.030
You know, Deej,

13:41.696 --> 13:43.030
over the years

13:43.072 --> 13:45.074
I have come

13:43.072 --> 13:45.074
a long way as a dad.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.367
I have learned, that there are

13:46.409 --> 13:48.536
many other techniques

13:46.409 --> 13:48.536
besides yelling.

13:48.578 --> 13:52.373
Sometimes, a subtle

13:48.578 --> 13:52.373
psychology can go a long way.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.626
Let's watch.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.670
What's "subtle psychology?"

13:56.711 --> 14:00.006
(Danny)

13:56.711 --> 14:00.006
'Look at this room!

13:56.711 --> 14:00.006
You call this clean?'

14:00.047 --> 14:02.091
Not that.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.803
Look, at this mess.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.803
Looks like your closet threw up!

14:04.843 --> 14:06.220
- But, dad--

14:04.843 --> 14:06.220
- No, but, dads.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.846
If this room is not

14:06.262 --> 14:07.846
up to Tanner standards

14:07.888 --> 14:09.516
you're gonna be

14:07.888 --> 14:09.516
grounded for two weeks.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.519
Bigfoot will be seen around

14:09.557 --> 14:12.519
this neighborhood more than you.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.770
Have I made myself clear?

14:13.812 --> 14:15.396
- Loud and clear.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.396
- Alright.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.524
And, D.J., I don't want

14:15.438 --> 14:17.524
you to see Kimmy anymore.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.567
- What?

14:17.565 --> 14:19.567
- Sorry, I was on a roll.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.985
Thought I'd give it a shot.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.281
Dad, what happened

14:22.945 --> 14:25.281
to "subtle psychology?"

14:25.323 --> 14:27.742
No, see that, that

14:25.323 --> 14:27.742
was subtle psychology.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.994
You don't want to

14:27.784 --> 14:29.994
see me when I get mad.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.041
Man, he sounded

14:32.205 --> 14:35.041
just like my mom.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.918
Last night she made me

14:35.082 --> 14:37.918
do the dishes.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.796
It's not like we were

14:37.960 --> 14:39.796
out of clean ones.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.633
- Yeah, well, I better get busy.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.633
- Yeah.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.926
Well, you know, I think,

14:43.675 --> 14:45.926
it's pretty cool you got away

14:45.968 --> 14:47.178
with it as long as you did.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.347
- I guess.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.347
- Well, see you later.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.558
Yeah, see ya.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.685
This room is not

14:51.599 --> 14:53.685
that gross.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.443
Ugh.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.653
Maybe it is.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.578
Alright, kids.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.121
The Katsopolis Institute

15:11.619 --> 15:14.121
of Lower Learning

15:14.163 --> 15:15.707
is now in session.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.167
(Jess)

15:15.749 --> 15:18.167
'Now, what better

15:15.749 --> 15:18.167
place to start'

15:18.209 --> 15:19.252
than the beginning, right?

15:19.293 --> 15:20.378
Here we go, guys.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.339
What letter is...this?

15:23.381 --> 15:24.632
(together)

15:23.381 --> 15:24.632
A.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.008
Yes. Good boys.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.927
See, my boys don't

15:26.050 --> 15:27.927
need preschool.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.637
'Okay, very good, very good.'

15:29.679 --> 15:31.472
Now, let's talk about some words

15:31.514 --> 15:33.307
that start with

15:31.514 --> 15:33.307
the letter A. Shall we?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.726
Alright, there we go.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.977
What's that? A is for?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.772
Rock.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.981
Uh, no, but well,

15:38.813 --> 15:40.981
heck of a try.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.317
Uh, Alex, A is for?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.611
Balloon.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.406
Uh, no, no.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.449
Good try, though, son.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.617
Good try.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.912
Help 'em out!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.622
I gotta go with

15:53.953 --> 15:55.622
Nicky on the rock.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.166
It starts with an A.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.628
Okay, a rock.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.047
And you are a idiot.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.133
Now, come on.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.510
You're supposed

16:07.174 --> 16:09.510
to help me here.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.429
Sit down!

16:11.471 --> 16:12.680
Alright, uh, uh..

16:12.722 --> 16:13.765
We're done with the alphabet.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.725
Now we're gonna move on to..

16:15.767 --> 16:16.976
...counting!

16:17.017 --> 16:19.061
I can help you out there, Jess.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.647
Okay, boys.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.024
Let's count candy.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.860
Alright. Okay, ready?

16:25.902 --> 16:27.695
One, two, three, four.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.322
Okay, now you guys count.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.120
I like counting.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.081
Let's count cookies.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.294
No, no. We're not gonna

16:41.375 --> 16:43.294
count cookies, here.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.337
We're here to learn.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.005
(together)

16:44.378 --> 16:46.005
We want cookies!

16:46.046 --> 16:47.632
(together)

16:46.046 --> 16:47.632
We want cookies!

16:47.674 --> 16:48.716
(together)

16:47.674 --> 16:48.716
We want cookies!

16:48.758 --> 16:50.802
I'm losing control here.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.638
Here, here. Here we go.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.638
Look, at this, guys, look.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.015
Hi. Look at him,

16:53.680 --> 16:56.015
look at him. Hi, guys.

16:56.056 --> 16:59.519
I'm a hot-daddy,

16:56.056 --> 16:59.519
uh, puppet-monkey boy..

16:59.560 --> 17:01.896
...and I'm here to tell you that

17:01.938 --> 17:03.523
we're gonna do something

17:01.938 --> 17:03.523
that's much fun

17:03.564 --> 17:05.817
you won't even think

17:03.564 --> 17:05.817
of cookies, you know what it is?

17:05.859 --> 17:07.109
(together)

17:05.859 --> 17:07.109
Jump on the bed.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.070
No, no. No, boys, no. No.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.990
Hot-daddy monkey-puppet boy says

17:12.031 --> 17:13.366
"Don't jump on the bed." Don't..

17:13.407 --> 17:14.617
[chuckling]

17:16.577 --> 17:17.745
What am I gonna do?

17:17.787 --> 17:19.079
Ooh! Ooh!

17:21.374 --> 17:23.083
(Joey)

17:21.374 --> 17:23.083
'Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!'

17:25.795 --> 17:27.129
Joey.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.217
You know, what my best

17:28.673 --> 17:31.217
subject was in preschool?

17:31.258 --> 17:32.927
Mm-mm.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.261
Naptime.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.516
You know, you actually

17:36.263 --> 17:38.516
may have something here.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.934
A nap is a good idea.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.895
You know, it's good

17:39.976 --> 17:41.895
w-w-we'll set 'em down.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.604
We'll calm 'em

17:41.936 --> 17:43.604
down, then regroup

17:43.646 --> 17:45.189
and then we'll start

17:43.646 --> 17:45.189
teaching 'em again after that.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.858
- Good, thinking, Lincoln.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.858
- Very good.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.317
Alright, naptime, boys.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.610
No nap! No nap!

17:49.652 --> 17:50.862
No nap! No nap!

17:50.904 --> 17:52.363
- No nap! No nap!

17:52.405 --> 17:55.033
Hey, hey, hey.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.033
Yes, nap. Yes, nap.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.410
- Yes, nap. Come on.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.410
- Come on.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.496
Now, you watch your Uncle Joey

17:57.451 --> 18:00.496
and I take a nap, okay?

18:00.538 --> 18:02.749
- Now, watch how fun this'll be.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.749
- Come here. Come here.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.168
Now, listen, very good.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.168
Lay down. Relax.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.921
Now close your eyes.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.923
Close your eyes. Good boys.

18:09.964 --> 18:13.092
Now, think of something

18:09.964 --> 18:13.092
really happy, okay?

18:13.133 --> 18:16.470
(Jess)

18:13.133 --> 18:16.470
'Close your eyes. Relax.'

18:16.512 --> 18:18.765
Just think of nice thoughts.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.183
[Joey snoring]

18:34.989 --> 18:37.033
Good job, brother.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.409
Thank you, brother.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.912
Hey, guys.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.830
- What are you doin'?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.830
- Shh!

18:42.872 --> 18:44.415
We're playing a trick.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.752
Hey, uh..

18:47.794 --> 18:49.545
...can your old mom play?

18:53.257 --> 18:55.009
(Jesse and Joey)

18:53.257 --> 18:55.009
Ow!

18:55.051 --> 18:56.844
- Hi, guys.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.844
- Oh.

18:56.886 --> 18:57.929
Beck, you're home.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.388
- Uh-huh.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.388
- Yeah.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.556
How's school goin'?

19:00.598 --> 19:02.433
Terrific. Good.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.433
Really good.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.727
We were just, uh,

19:02.475 --> 19:04.727
we were just doing a little, uh

19:04.769 --> 19:07.187
little art appreciation.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.857
Well, look down, I think,

19:07.229 --> 19:09.857
you'll appreciate it.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.530
Beck, it-it-it's

19:14.361 --> 19:16.530
not how it looks.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.699
Oh, so the boys weren't

19:16.572 --> 19:18.699
painting your feet

19:18.741 --> 19:20.868
while you two fine

19:18.741 --> 19:20.868
educators were out cold?

19:22.202 --> 19:24.705
Alright, it is how

19:22.202 --> 19:24.705
it looks, isn't it?

19:24.747 --> 19:26.290
See, if they paint

19:24.747 --> 19:26.290
up to the ankle line.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.416
Right.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.293
I can save

19:27.458 --> 19:29.293
big bucks on socks.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.173
Out!

19:34.214 --> 19:35.508
Class dismissed.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.721
Ah, Beck, this whole

19:37.593 --> 19:40.721
thing was a disaster.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.349
I'm not qualified

19:40.763 --> 19:43.349
to teach preschool.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.476
Joey's barely

19:43.390 --> 19:45.476
qualified to attend.

19:47.145 --> 19:50.439
Aw, honey, it's too bad

19:47.145 --> 19:50.439
the boys didn't like preschool.

19:50.481 --> 19:54.068
- Well..

19:50.481 --> 19:54.068
- We liked preschool.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.361
Really?

19:55.402 --> 19:57.196
Miss Suzie is nice.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.618
Jess, uh, it sounds to me

19:59.115 --> 20:02.618
like they like preschool.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.121
Well, sure, yes.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.121
They, they, say so now.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.540
But you should've seen

20:05.163 --> 20:07.540
their little faces

20:07.581 --> 20:09.917
in the, in the corner

20:07.581 --> 20:09.917
of that classroom, all..

20:09.959 --> 20:11.836
Were they crying?

20:11.878 --> 20:13.046
Well, they weren't crying

20:13.087 --> 20:15.506
in a, in a waterworks

20:13.087 --> 20:15.506
way crying.

20:15.548 --> 20:20.887
I mean, it was more of a, it was

20:15.548 --> 20:20.887
more of a dry cry, really.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.097
Were, were they angry?

20:23.139 --> 20:25.016
Well, no, they weren't angry.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.350
Per se.

20:28.061 --> 20:31.271
What were they, uh, per se?

20:31.313 --> 20:33.357
Well, per se they were, uh..

20:34.483 --> 20:36.819
They were laughing

20:34.483 --> 20:36.819
and playing.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.863
Sounds like you got 'em

20:36.861 --> 20:38.863
out of there just in time.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.490
You weren't the

20:40.031 --> 20:41.490
only one to lose it.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.450
I lost it, too. I mean,

20:41.532 --> 20:43.450
I was fine at breakfast.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.078
You know, we were

20:43.492 --> 20:45.078
grooving in the car.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.537
Beach Boys were on,

20:45.119 --> 20:46.537
the kids were shaking the hair

20:46.579 --> 20:48.288
and then all of a sudden

20:46.579 --> 20:48.288
I get to the classroom

20:48.330 --> 20:49.957
I asked for a kiss,

20:48.330 --> 20:49.957
I pucker up..

20:49.999 --> 20:52.085
Boom. They stiff me,

20:49.999 --> 20:52.085
I'm left mid-pucker.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.380
Aw, honey, they didn't

20:53.669 --> 20:56.380
even kiss you goodbye?

20:56.422 --> 20:57.631
No.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.134
It was like they

20:57.673 --> 21:00.134
didn't even need me.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.677
All that time we spent

21:01.719 --> 21:03.554
rocking them to sleep and..

21:03.596 --> 21:06.306
...feeding 'em

21:03.596 --> 21:06.306
and wiping their little faces

21:06.348 --> 21:09.268
and their little noses

21:06.348 --> 21:09.268
and all those other..

21:09.309 --> 21:11.896
...wipeable areas.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.607
It's like none of that

21:11.938 --> 21:14.607
mattered, you know?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.025
I mean, I just

21:14.648 --> 21:16.025
wanted to hold on

21:16.067 --> 21:17.693
just wanted to hold

21:16.067 --> 21:17.693
on for one more second

21:17.735 --> 21:20.404
and they...they didn't

21:17.735 --> 21:20.404
even turn around.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.825
You know, Jess, maybe it's good

21:22.115 --> 21:24.825
that they didn't look back.

21:24.867 --> 21:28.079
I mean, maybe it means that

21:24.867 --> 21:28.079
we've given them the confidence

21:28.121 --> 21:30.748
to go out and face

21:28.121 --> 21:30.748
the world without us.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.999
The world?

21:32.041 --> 21:34.001
Beck, up until this

21:32.041 --> 21:34.001
preschool thing

21:34.043 --> 21:36.129
we were their world.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.505
Honey, if we're

21:36.170 --> 21:38.505
acting like this now

21:38.547 --> 21:40.382
what are we gonna be like

21:38.547 --> 21:40.382
when, you know, they get

21:40.424 --> 21:42.551
their license

21:40.424 --> 21:42.551
or they go to college

21:42.593 --> 21:44.804
get married and

21:42.593 --> 21:44.804
have their own kids?

21:44.845 --> 21:46.764
You're right, honey.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.599
You know, suddenly

21:46.806 --> 21:48.599
this preschool thing

21:48.641 --> 21:50.059
doesn't sound so bad.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.185
I know it's hard to let go

21:51.227 --> 21:52.478
but we gotta do it sometime.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.480
- Might, as well be know.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.480
- Hmm.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.274
I'd hate to walk

21:54.521 --> 21:56.274
into college with..

21:56.315 --> 21:59.526
...two freshmen

21:56.315 --> 21:59.526
clinging to my legs.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.861
Nicky, Alex!

22:00.903 --> 22:03.322
Tomorrow you guys are

22:00.903 --> 22:03.322
goin' back to preschool.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.824
- Yay!

22:04.865 --> 22:06.575
That's right, but first

22:04.865 --> 22:06.575
we want our kisses.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.702
So get over here, pucker up

22:06.617 --> 22:08.702
and give us a kiss goodbye.

(Jesse)

22:08.744 --> 22:11.080
'Come here.'

22:16.669 --> 22:18.171
Well, Jess, this is it.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.630
The moment of truth.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.631
Can you let go?

22:20.673 --> 22:22.216
I can let go.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.302
Jess, let go.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.512
Oh. Right. Yeah.

Bye-bye, boys.
