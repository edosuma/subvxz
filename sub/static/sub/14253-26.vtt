01:22.248 --> 01:27.208
Four of Twelve,
Subjunction of Unimatrix 525.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.949
You have a disease.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.218
You're one of many
with this sickness.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.351
We want to cure you.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.792
But we need a better way

01:35.862 --> 01:38.126
to identify those
with the mutation.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.961
Our testing method is too slow.

01:40.033 --> 01:44.094
lt could take centuries
to identify everyone.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.711
Help me find the interlink
frequency that binds

01:58.785 --> 01:59.979
all of you together.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.247
Then we can put an end
to this,

02:02.322 --> 02:04.119
quickly,

02:04.190 --> 02:06.158
efficiently.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.061
Comply.

02:15.435 --> 02:18.495
l've disconnected you
from the hive mind.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.435
You're alone.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.947
l know how uncomfortable
that can be.

02:31.417 --> 02:36.878
Tell me what l want to know,
then you can rejoin us.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.823
l... don't... know.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.487
You must remember something.

02:42.562 --> 02:43.893
l don't... remember.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.260
The frequency.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.696
l don't remember!

02:46.766 --> 02:49.291
Deactivate him.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.666
Wait.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.901
Dismantle him.

02:55.975 --> 02:59.502
Bring me his cortical array.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.415
That reminds me of the time

05:24.490 --> 05:26.617
my mother caught me
feeding lerraberries

05:26.693 --> 05:28.593
to my younger brother.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.856
What's a lerraberry?

05:30.930 --> 05:32.557
We'll save that for next time.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.156
Until then.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.463
Annika.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.214
Another milestone.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.783
You've had your first dream.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.158
l felt awake.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.254
Dreams can often seem
quite real.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.561
Tell me more
about this forest.

06:08.935 --> 06:12.166
lt was... familiar.

06:12.238 --> 06:13.762
Perhaps your unconscious mind

06:13.840 --> 06:15.740
was drawing
on a childhood memory.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.800
l spoke to someone.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.403
He called me
by my human name.

06:21.481 --> 06:22.880
Did you recognize him?

06:22.949 --> 06:25.918
He seemed... familiar.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.577
This could give us
a fascinating glimpse

06:28.654 --> 06:30.315
into your unconscious mind.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.789
Any one of those images

06:31.858 --> 06:33.689
might have a symbolic meaning.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.422
The mysterious stranger,
for example- -

06:36.496 --> 06:39.021
is he a father figure,
or does he represent

06:39.098 --> 06:41.692
a repressed desire
for male companionship?

06:41.768 --> 06:43.668
l don't wish to dream again.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.102
Please repair
my cortical array.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.800
This isn't
a malfunction, Seven.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.140
lt's a natural step
in your human development.

06:52.211 --> 06:55.578
lt might seem unsettling now,
but you'll get used to it.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.411
Before you know it,

06:57.483 --> 07:01.476
you'll look forward to climbing
into your alcove each night.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.114
This will keep a record
of your REM cycles.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.869
You're late, Mr. Paris.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.065
Ma'am?

07:21.140 --> 07:22.630
According to the ship's
chronometer,

07:22.708 --> 07:24.300
by 22 seconds.

07:24.377 --> 07:27.676
l'll make it up
at the end of my shift.

07:27.747 --> 07:28.873
See that you do.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.313
Take your station.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.227
Open it.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.767
That's an order.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.906
Not only late
but improperly dressed.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.466
That belongs
on your collar, Mr. Paris.

07:58.544 --> 07:59.602
Allow me.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.881
As ship's Captain,

08:03.015 --> 08:06.883
l hereby reinstate you
to the rank of Lieutenant,

08:07.019 --> 08:10.511
with all the privileges
and responsibilities therein.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.286
Your performance on this ship
over the past year

08:13.359 --> 08:14.417
has been exemplary.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.462
l expect more of the same.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.121
You won't be disappointed.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.789
Congratulations...

08:19.866 --> 08:21.493
Lieutenant.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.829
l didn't notice a little box
on my chair.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.938
Hiding a cake in the console?

08:31.544 --> 08:33.307
Looks like a distress call.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.812
Put it through.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.905
l'm getting a carrier wave,

08:37.049 --> 08:37.913
but no message.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.244
Origin?

08:39.318 --> 08:40.546
An asteroid,

08:40.620 --> 08:42.918
approximately two light- years
from here.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.115
Yellow Alert.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.521
Set a course.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.424
We're in range.

08:56.502 --> 08:57.491
Drop to impulse.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.832
On screen.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.274
Magnify.

09:04.343 --> 09:06.368
l am reading
artificial structures.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.413
lt's a colony of some kind.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.675
Open a channel.

09:09.749 --> 09:13.082
This is Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.916
We've received
your distress call.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.560
Life signs?

09:28.634 --> 09:30.226
None.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.238
l'm detecting residual
weapons signatures.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.637
They're Borg.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.437
Any vessels?

09:37.510 --> 09:38.636
One.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.702
A cube at the edge
of this system.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.544
Resume our previous course,
Mr. Paris. Warp 6.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.880
Make a note
in the ship's record:

09:45.952 --> 09:49.183
We responded to a distress call
at 0900 hours,

09:49.255 --> 09:51.917
arrived at the colony
two hours later.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.551
No survivors.

09:54.627 --> 09:57.323
We don't know
who these people were,

09:57.396 --> 10:00.797
but we know
the Borg destroyed them.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.499
Come with me.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.299
l'm regenerating.
This is only a dream.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.396
You're not dreaming.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.497
l brought you here.

10:41.574 --> 10:42.836
This is Unimatrix Zero.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.814
There is no Unimatrix Zero.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.078
Who are you?

10:53.152 --> 10:54.676
Five of Twelve- -

10:54.754 --> 10:57.587
Secondary Adjunct
of Trimatrix 942.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.354
But when l'm here,
my name is Axum.

11:01.427 --> 11:02.655
Axum.

11:02.728 --> 11:03.922
Sound familiar?

11:04.063 --> 11:05.325
Yes.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.923
Good. lt's starting
to come back to you.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.762
ls anyone here?

11:23.315 --> 11:24.942
Hello.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.451
l think l'm lost.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.488
l'm Axum.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.113
This is Annika.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.759
My father's ship
started shaking.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.227
Men came aboard.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.662
They looked like machines.

11:39.732 --> 11:42.530
Will you help me find my father?

11:42.601 --> 11:44.660
l'll see what l can do.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.365
There are
other children here.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.533
Would you like to meet them?

11:49.608 --> 11:50.973
l just got here, too.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.340
This environment
is intimidating,

11:53.412 --> 11:55.107
but l believe it's safe.

12:02.688 --> 12:04.417
He was just assimilated.

12:04.490 --> 12:07.653
He's probably still
in a maturation chamber.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.821
Are you telling me
this isn't a real place?

12:10.896 --> 12:13.490
lt's some kind of
virtual construct?

12:13.566 --> 12:16.729
We come here during
our regeneration cycles.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.202
We can exist
as individuals here.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.576
Unimatrix Zero.

12:28.647 --> 12:31.138
You used to come here,

12:31.217 --> 12:34.675
before you escaped
the collective.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.246
You have the recessive
mutation, too.

12:38.324 --> 12:41.316
Don't you remember any of it?

12:41.393 --> 12:44.362
No. What mutation?

12:44.430 --> 12:49.367
Only one out of a million
drones has it.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.165
Why did you
bring me here now?

12:52.238 --> 12:56.334
The collective has
found a way to detect us.

12:56.408 --> 12:59.969
lt's a lengthy procedure,
but they've managed to identify

13:00.079 --> 13:03.879
and deactivate nearly 200 of us
over the last few months.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.316
lt's only a matter of time
before they find enough of us

13:07.386 --> 13:09.911
to isolate
the interlink frequency.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.753
Once they've done that...

13:12.825 --> 13:15.919
You can help us stop them.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.825
Clarify.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.660
We've designed a nanovirus

13:19.732 --> 13:22.724
that should mask
the biochemical signature

13:22.802 --> 13:25.327
of the mutation,
but we need someone

13:25.404 --> 13:27.804
to release it into
the collective.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.103
You're already on a Borg vessel.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.575
Why don't you do it?

13:31.644 --> 13:34.772
When we've completed
our regeneration cycles,

13:34.847 --> 13:37.111
we have no memory
of this place.

13:37.183 --> 13:41.643
But you're not a part of
the collective anymore.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.850
You're our only connection
to the real world.

13:55.668 --> 14:00.435
Scan the node
for residual harmonics.

14:00.506 --> 14:04.738
lt's a shame you're not alive
to experience disembodiment.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.904
lt's the epitome of perfection.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.344
Give it to me.

14:13.085 --> 14:15.485
We have isolated
the carrier band,

14:15.554 --> 14:19.581
but it's useless to us
without the precise frequency.

14:20.926 --> 14:23.588
We need additional data.

14:23.662 --> 14:27.189
Two more of the mutations
have been discovered

14:27.266 --> 14:28.824
in Spatial Grid 649.

14:28.901 --> 14:31.927
Have their cortical nodes
removed and analyzed.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.802
Bring me the results.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.847
Unimatrix Zero is our sanctuary.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.911
When we're here,
our thoughts are our own.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.479
What was my function?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.548
You're thinking like a Borg.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.686
Our only function here
is to try and regain

14:56.762 --> 15:00.823
a fragment of the lives we lost
when we were assimilated.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.027
Mr. Axum?

15:03.102 --> 15:04.660
Go introduce yourself.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.897
They won't mind.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.063
Hello.

15:07.139 --> 15:09.073
- Do you want to play?
- Sure.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.632
Siral. Over here.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.439
- Ah.
- l was hoping you'd come.

15:13.512 --> 15:14.911
lt's great to see you.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.813
lt's always good to be back.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.077
l want to introduce...

15:19.151 --> 15:20.550
l remember him.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.211
You were friends.

15:22.288 --> 15:25.155
You knew a lot of people here.

15:25.224 --> 15:28.785
You were part of our lives
for 18 years.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.896
l'm willing to help...

15:35.968 --> 15:37.560
but l can't do it alone.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.661
l'm part of a starship crew now.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.729
l'll have to inform my Captain.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.241
l told you
not to bring her here.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.403
We can't do this by ourselves.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.105
lt's too great a risk.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.442
We don't have a choice.

15:49.515 --> 15:52.211
You do not speak for all of us!

15:52.284 --> 15:53.717
What would you rather do?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.152
Have us wait until
we're all discovered?

15:56.221 --> 15:57.654
You disappoint me.

15:57.723 --> 15:59.350
Where's your warrior spirit?

15:59.425 --> 16:00.687
pahtk!

16:00.759 --> 16:03.728
l'll rip your heart out.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.627
Go ahead.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.563
Kill me.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.091
l'll be back when l begin
my next regeneration cycle.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.037
You can't stop me, Korok.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.734
lf you come here again...

16:17.810 --> 16:21.075
you'll be putting
your starship at risk

16:21.146 --> 16:23.046
and all of us as well.

16:23.115 --> 16:25.982
Shouldn't you be off
sharpening your teeth?

16:30.723 --> 16:31.917
l know you.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.355
Your name is Laura.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.018
You're human.

16:36.095 --> 16:39.724
l was assimilated at Wolf 359.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.164
lt's good to see you again.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.532
But you look out of place.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.935
Your cybernetic implants...

16:47.072 --> 16:50.371
Our Doctor was unable to remove
all of my Borg components.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.706
You don't have
to look that way here.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.178
My appearance is irrelevant.

16:55.247 --> 16:57.112
No, it's not.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.275
They may have turned
us into drones,

16:59.351 --> 17:02.286
but they can't change
the essence of who we are.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.878
My cycle is about to end.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.218
Talk to your Captain.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.984
We can't do this without...

17:25.444 --> 17:27.377
Another round with the Borg?

17:27.445 --> 17:29.812
We'd only need to infiltrate
a single vessel.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.816
Oh. Just one?

17:31.884 --> 17:34.478
l am prepared to take a
shuttle and do this alone.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.145
No offense, but how do you know

17:36.221 --> 17:38.189
that this wasn't
some kind of a dream?

17:38.257 --> 17:40.225
Seven was wearing
a cortical monitor.

17:40.292 --> 17:41.782
She never reached REM sleep.

17:41.860 --> 17:42.918
She wasn't dreaming.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.552
Unimatrix Zero is real,

17:44.630 --> 17:47.224
and so are the people
who go there.

17:47.299 --> 17:48.823
They need our help.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.428
What else can you tell
us about this place?

17:52.504 --> 17:53.562
How many drones?

17:53.639 --> 17:54.663
No one is certain.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.105
Axum told me
there could be tens of...

17:56.175 --> 17:57.164
Axum?

17:57.242 --> 18:00.370
He's... someone l used to know.

18:00.446 --> 18:04.405
He told me there could be
tens of thousands, perhaps more.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.644
How was it created?

18:06.718 --> 18:09.516
Some of them believe
it began as a random malfunction

18:09.588 --> 18:11.715
during the assimilation
of a single drone

18:11.790 --> 18:13.690
and eventually spread
to the others.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.226
Well, this is all
very interesting,

18:15.294 --> 18:17.854
but are we sure it's worth
putting our lives on the line?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.227
lt's my understanding

18:19.298 --> 18:22.495
that when we receive
a distress call, we respond- -

18:22.568 --> 18:23.830
Starfleet protocols.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.130
She's right.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.501
This is no different.

18:26.572 --> 18:29.370
l understand your reluctance,
but Seven's discovered

18:29.441 --> 18:31.602
a potential weakness
in the collective.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.372
Before we decide
how to proceed,

18:33.445 --> 18:35.913
l'd like to learn
as much about it as we can.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.879
Too bad you don't have
the luxury

18:37.950 --> 18:39.110
of an interlink node.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.742
There is another possibility.

18:40.819 --> 18:43.788
A Vulcan technique known
as ''the bridging of minds.''

18:43.856 --> 18:45.289
Go on.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.222
l would need to initiate
a mind- meld

18:47.292 --> 18:50.227
with both you and Seven, acting
as a telepathic conduit.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.230
You make it sound
like a conference call.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.663
Captain, it is
my professional opinion

18:54.733 --> 18:56.064
that we wait until...

18:56.135 --> 18:57.124
Objection noted.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.968
l think you'll be
turning in early tonight.

19:05.377 --> 19:06.401
Stay at Yellow Alert.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.639
Maintain long- range scans
for Borg vessels.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.080
Any sign of trouble,
you know where to find me.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.710
This will be one away mission
for the record books.

19:13.785 --> 19:14.877
Mind- melds.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.421
The last time l heard the words
''my mind to your mind,''

19:17.489 --> 19:18.786
l had a headache for two weeks.

19:18.857 --> 19:19.846
l'm willing to volunteer

19:19.925 --> 19:21.415
if you'd rather
hold down the fort.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.188
l appreciate
your trying to protect me,

19:23.262 --> 19:24.695
but a chance
to see this place...

19:25.764 --> 19:27.129
it's worth a headache.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.531
How many times
have you actually performed

19:29.601 --> 19:31.034
this ''bridging of heads''?

19:31.103 --> 19:32.798
''Minds.'' Never.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.839
Then how can you
be certain it'll work?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.306
Nothing is certain, Doctor.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.434
However, l once observed
a Vulcan master

19:38.510 --> 19:39.636
perform the technique.

19:39.711 --> 19:42.509
l am reasonably confident
l can duplicate his success.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.845
Watching and doing
are two different things.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.748
As always, your logic
is impeccable.

19:46.818 --> 19:47.910
What a comfort.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.078
We're ready, Captain.

19:49.154 --> 19:50.985
Let's do it.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.765
As the conduit, l'll be aware
of both your perceptions.

20:05.837 --> 20:09.136
lf something goes wrong,
l'll break the meld.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.698
Understood.

20:17.115 --> 20:18.377
Your minds

20:18.450 --> 20:19.815
to my mind.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.513
Your thoughts

20:22.588 --> 20:24.453
to my thoughts.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.855
Your minds to my mind.

20:28.927 --> 20:32.363
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

20:38.470 --> 20:41.268
Welcome to Unimatrix Zero.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.534
Seven?

20:42.608 --> 20:44.974
Annika.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.602
That's what l'm called here.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.217
Drones?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.848
Come on, let's find Axum.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.298
We're close.

21:07.366 --> 21:12.167
l can almost hear them.

21:12.237 --> 21:13.898
Bring us closer.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.949
There.

21:30.088 --> 21:31.555
Amplify.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.864
Disrupt the frequency.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.662
lt's not working.

21:46.738 --> 21:50.105
They're using
a triaxialating modulation.

21:50.175 --> 21:54.976
You're making this
very difficult.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.641
lf we can't terminate
their link...

21:58.717 --> 22:03.177
then we'll simply
have to pay them a visit.

22:04.690 --> 22:07.488
You can see why we want
to protect this place.

22:07.559 --> 22:09.117
We're prepared to help you,

22:09.194 --> 22:10.286
but l'm concerned

22:10.362 --> 22:12.922
that we'd only be putting
off the inevitable.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.293
Even if we succeeded,

22:14.366 --> 22:17.335
and you could remain hidden
for a year, ten years,

22:17.402 --> 22:19.802
the Borg would eventually
find you again.

22:19.871 --> 22:22.897
Have you ever considered
a more permanent solution?

22:22.974 --> 22:24.498
More permanent?

22:24.576 --> 22:27.204
You've got a remarkable
sanctuary here,

22:27.279 --> 22:28.746
but that's all it is.

22:28.814 --> 22:33.114
Maybe it's time to stop hiding
and find a way to fight back.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.447
That's not possible.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.952
lf you could find a way

22:36.088 --> 22:39.387
to carry your individualities
into the real world- -

22:39.458 --> 22:41.949
to wake up from
your regeneration cycles

22:42.094 --> 22:43.789
with your memories intact- -

22:43.862 --> 22:46.626
you could begin to undermine
the Borg's control over you.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.963
That sounds like you're
suggesting a civil war.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.400
l'd prefer to call it...

22:52.471 --> 22:54.837
a resistance movement.

22:54.906 --> 22:57.500
That's very ambitious, Captain,

22:57.576 --> 22:59.771
but we can't retain
our memories.

22:59.845 --> 23:02.006
Not yet,
but we know a good deal

23:02.080 --> 23:03.570
about Borg technology.

23:03.648 --> 23:04.808
Maybe we could...

23:42.988 --> 23:45.684
We've found another.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.884
Spatial Grid 326.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.893
Cube 1 184.

23:49.961 --> 23:51.861
Continue.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.910
Welcome back.

24:13.051 --> 24:14.916
Spatial Grid 982.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.248
Cube 461.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.028
No.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.714
Janeway.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.336
How's your headache?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.217
l'm guessing it didn't go well.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.221
Let's just say
we ran into a little trouble.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.347
Have a seat, Commander.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.357
l prefer to stand.

25:27.425 --> 25:31.521
The collective's found a way
to infiltrate Unimatrix Zero.

25:31.596 --> 25:34.064
lt won't be long
before they learn enough

25:34.132 --> 25:36.225
to destroy it
from the inside out.

25:36.301 --> 25:38.929
l plan to stop them.

25:39.070 --> 25:40.799
What have you got in mind?

25:40.872 --> 25:43.136
The people there are vulnerable.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.142
They don't have the ability

25:45.210 --> 25:47.440
to take action
in the real world.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.412
We're going to give
them that ability.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.073
How?

25:52.150 --> 25:54.812
The Doctor and B'Elanna
are working on it.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.183
l know what you're thinking.

25:56.254 --> 25:57.346
We'd be violating

25:57.422 --> 25:59.185
half a dozen
Starfleet protocols,

25:59.257 --> 26:02.124
and if the collective ever
learned we were involved,

26:02.193 --> 26:05.162
we'd be putting Voyager
in the middle of a civil war.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.822
Valid objections.

26:08.366 --> 26:09.799
Chakotay...

26:09.868 --> 26:12.336
we've had our disagreements,

26:12.404 --> 26:15.430
and there have been times
when l've chosen to proceed

26:15.507 --> 26:17.566
without your support.

26:17.642 --> 26:20.770
But this can't be
one of those times.

26:20.845 --> 26:24.781
l won't do this
without my First Officer.

26:24.849 --> 26:25.907
The way l see it,

26:26.051 --> 26:29.316
risking the safety of Voyager
is a small price to pay.

26:29.387 --> 26:30.649
lf we help these people,

26:30.722 --> 26:33.657
this could be the turning point
in our battle against the Borg.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.659
l'm glad we agree,

26:35.727 --> 26:37.922
because l almost talked myself
out of it.

26:38.029 --> 26:39.894
Somehow, l don't think

26:39.965 --> 26:42.934
you were ever in danger
of doing that.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.026
You'll inform the crew?

26:51.142 --> 26:53.303
This is the nanovirus
Axum designed to prevent

26:53.378 --> 26:56.142
the Borg from detecting those
with the genetic mutation,

26:56.214 --> 26:57.704
but l've modified it to nullify

26:57.782 --> 26:59.477
their cortical inhibitors
instead.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.849
Once they're infected,
they should retain

27:01.920 --> 27:05.117
their memories of Unimatrix Zero
after they leave their alcoves.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.658
Does that mean they'll be able
to function as individuals?

27:07.726 --> 27:09.023
Stand up to the collective?

27:09.094 --> 27:10.527
There's no way to tell.

27:10.595 --> 27:12.222
This is highly experimental.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.696
How do we deploy it?

27:13.765 --> 27:15.198
Correct me if l'm wrong,

27:15.266 --> 27:17.131
but each Borg vessel
has a device

27:17.202 --> 27:19.466
that links it
to every other Borg ship.

27:19.537 --> 27:20.799
The central plexus.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.863
lf we can gain access
to one of those

27:22.941 --> 27:24.465
and release the virus there,

27:24.542 --> 27:27.511
it should be transmitted
throughout the collective...

27:27.579 --> 27:28.671
instantly.

27:28.747 --> 27:31.682
Any Borg activity in the region?

27:33.885 --> 27:35.819
They just dropped
out of transwarp

27:35.887 --> 27:38.515
3.6 light- years from here.

27:38.590 --> 27:41.923
This is a class- 4
tactical vessel, heavily armed.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.222
The central plexus is protected
by multiregenerative

27:44.295 --> 27:46.229
security grids.

27:46.297 --> 27:48.231
We'd be detected
long before we could reach it.

27:48.299 --> 27:49.891
Meet me in Engineering.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.061
We're going to find a way in.

27:52.137 --> 27:53.126
Prepare the virus.

27:53.204 --> 27:54.501
Aye, Captain.

28:01.312 --> 28:03.780
l think it's time for you
to take another nap.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.975
Pay a visit to Unimatrix Zero.

28:06.051 --> 28:09.248
Tell our friends
we haven't forgotten them.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.685
l couldn't help but notice

28:10.755 --> 28:13.246
you were a little different
in Unimatrix Zero,

28:13.324 --> 28:15.758
and l don't mean
your lack of Borg implants.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.454
You seemed more...

28:17.529 --> 28:18.689
Human.

28:18.763 --> 28:21.459
lf you don't mind
my saying so, it suited you.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.434
l've been told l spent
a great deal of time there,

28:24.502 --> 28:26.663
but since l don't
remember Unimatrix Zero

28:26.738 --> 28:29.263
any more than l remember Earth,
it's irrelevant.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.602
To you, maybe,

28:30.675 --> 28:32.802
but if what l saw
was any indication,

28:32.877 --> 28:35.038
Annika would disagree.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.851
The Klingons
have banded together,

28:40.919 --> 28:44.013
and they're giving bat'leths
to anybody who can handle one.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.454
Hirogen hunters are moving

28:45.523 --> 28:47.457
through the forest,
targeting drones,

28:47.525 --> 28:49.425
but we're losing
people every hour.

28:49.494 --> 28:51.689
Captain Janeway intends
to keep her promise.

28:51.763 --> 28:53.924
This isn't your battle.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.863
You don't owe us anything.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.164
Voyager won't abandon you.

29:02.006 --> 29:04.873
A gift from Korok.

29:04.976 --> 29:07.069
Takes some getting used to.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.579
l'm sure you'll adapt.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.847
1 1 more drones.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.282
300 meters.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.590
Sorry.

30:04.169 --> 30:07.798
That felt... familiar- -

30:07.872 --> 30:09.931
our touching.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.943
l told you, we were friends.

30:13.044 --> 30:14.944
Elaborate.

30:15.046 --> 30:18.743
Now is not the best time.

30:32.397 --> 30:35.525
We were more than friends...

30:35.600 --> 30:36.931
weren't we?

30:39.971 --> 30:41.666
Why didn't you tell me?

30:41.739 --> 30:44.207
You'd forgotten.

30:44.275 --> 30:46.072
lt wasn't my place.

30:47.879 --> 30:49.403
How long?

30:49.480 --> 30:51.573
Six years.

30:51.649 --> 30:55.278
Only while we were regenerating.

30:55.353 --> 30:59.289
A very memorable six years.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.689
For me, anyway.

31:01.759 --> 31:04.421
l should return to Voyager.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.631
Annika...

31:07.699 --> 31:10.532
My name is Seven of Nine.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.477
Can't we find another Borg ship?

31:24.549 --> 31:25.481
A sphere, maybe?

31:25.550 --> 31:26.642
Something less imposing?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.208
l rechecked long- range sensors.

31:28.286 --> 31:29.947
There's nothing.

31:30.088 --> 31:31.612
This is our target.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.816
You'll keep a transporter
lock on me.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.416
Once l make it
to the central plexus

31:35.493 --> 31:37.461
and release the virus,
you can beam me back.

31:37.528 --> 31:38.688
ln how many pieces?

31:38.763 --> 31:39.787
lt's ridiculous!

31:39.864 --> 31:40.922
Agreed.

31:40.999 --> 31:41.931
l should go.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.331
l'm the only one
with experience.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.961
You're our only connection
to Unimatrix Zero.

31:46.104 --> 31:47.128
You're needed here.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.799
lt was my decision
to help these people.

31:49.874 --> 31:51.535
This is my responsibility.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.873
Starfleet Tactical Directive 36:

31:53.945 --> 31:55.913
''The Captain will not engage
a hostile force

31:55.980 --> 31:59.108
without the protection
of a security officer.''

31:59.183 --> 32:01.151
The probability of success
is greater

32:01.219 --> 32:02.447
if there are two of us.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.578
Make that three.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.179
lf you're going
to pull this off,

32:05.256 --> 32:06.814
you'll need an engineer
in there.

32:06.891 --> 32:07.823
B'Elanna...

32:07.892 --> 32:09.325
Tactical Directive 36- A.

32:09.394 --> 32:11.692
There is no Directive 36- A.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.025
There is now.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.689
l appreciate the offer,

32:14.766 --> 32:16.734
but if that cube
attacks Voyager,

32:16.801 --> 32:18.132
you'll be needed here.

32:18.202 --> 32:19.760
Now you have your orders.

32:19.837 --> 32:21.862
Set a course, Mr. Paris.

32:27.545 --> 32:28.807
Remember when l said

32:28.880 --> 32:30.677
l didn't have any objections?

32:30.748 --> 32:32.875
Can't this wait till l get back?

32:32.951 --> 32:35.476
l realize l'm not going
to talk you out of this,

32:35.553 --> 32:37.851
but l'll be damned
if you're going in there alone.

32:37.922 --> 32:39.890
We've got a lot of work to do,
Commander.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.324
You said you wanted my support.

32:42.393 --> 32:44.293
Then take Tuvok
and B'Elanna with you.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.829
And if l don't?

32:45.897 --> 32:48.457
l may only be First Officer,

32:48.533 --> 32:50.694
but l still pull
a few strings around here.

32:50.768 --> 32:52.167
The Doctor could be persuaded

32:52.236 --> 32:53.897
to question
your medical fitness.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.940
l was hoping for
your unconditional support.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.772
This is the best l can do.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.647
Tell them to pack light.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.510
Janeway to Bridge. Report.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.814
Someone's trying to tap
into the main computer.

33:08.886 --> 33:10.751
Source?

33:10.822 --> 33:14.280
lt's some kind
of transwarp signal.

33:14.359 --> 33:16.350
lt's activating the com system.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.769
Captain...

33:26.838 --> 33:29.272
l think it's for you.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.645
Captain.

33:43.721 --> 33:47.054
lt's been a long time.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.958
How are things
in the collective?

33:50.094 --> 33:51.618
Perfect...

33:51.696 --> 33:53.527
for the most part.

33:53.598 --> 33:55.122
Voyager?

33:55.199 --> 33:56.962
Never better.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.194
l understand

33:58.269 --> 34:00.499
you've established contact
with Starfleet.

34:00.571 --> 34:04.507
Perhaps you'll be getting home
sooner than you expected.

34:04.575 --> 34:05.667
Perhaps.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.904
We could help you.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.742
How so?

34:09.813 --> 34:12.078
Transwarp technology.

34:12.150 --> 34:15.347
You'd find that we can
be quite accommodating...

34:15.420 --> 34:17.353
but we'd expect the same
in return.

34:17.422 --> 34:21.016
l'm not sure
l know what you mean.

34:23.226 --> 34:25.922
You know exactly what l mean.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.429
Tend to your own crew.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.364
Stay away from things
that don't concern you.

34:30.435 --> 34:33.871
l'm afraid l can't do that,
but thanks for the offer.

34:33.938 --> 34:38.068
l won't be as accommodating
next time.

34:38.141 --> 34:40.507
Reconsider.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.375
l'm sorry.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.981
We'll see you soon, Harry.

34:52.156 --> 34:54.487
What does she mean by that?

34:57.361 --> 34:59.454
Why this stab at diplomacy?

34:59.530 --> 35:01.862
She's trying to find
out what we're up to.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.867
She's worried.

35:03.935 --> 35:07.098
Have B'Elanna and Tuvok
meet me in Sick Bay.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.209
Watch the starboard
plasma injectors.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.845
They tend to run a little hot
at high impulse.

35:23.921 --> 35:25.320
l'll keep an eye on it.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.914
And the warp matrix
is out of alignment.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.119
By .3 microns.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.128
Since when are you
so meticulous?

35:32.196 --> 35:35.461
Since you volunteered
for this insane mission.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.468
You know...

35:38.536 --> 35:39.935
l could sabotage the helm.

35:40.004 --> 35:42.097
You'd never make it
out the launch doors.

35:42.173 --> 35:44.073
And l'd have to put you
on report.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.167
You might lose
that new pip of yours.

35:46.244 --> 35:48.712
lt'd be a small price to pay.

35:56.020 --> 35:57.248
We're in visual range.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.289
On screen.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.325
Magnify.

36:05.296 --> 36:06.786
Torres to Bridge.

36:06.864 --> 36:08.126
Go ahead.

36:08.199 --> 36:10.997
The Delta Flyer
is ready for launch.

36:11.068 --> 36:13.036
On my way.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.144
Guess l'd better be going, huh?

36:20.211 --> 36:23.203
Anything you'd like done
around here while you're gone?

36:23.281 --> 36:24.908
Gravity plating recalibrated,

36:24.982 --> 36:26.449
carpets cleaned?

36:30.421 --> 36:32.651
Surprise me.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.627
You have the Bridge.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.108
You need to prepare the others.

36:51.175 --> 36:52.142
When they leave
their alcoves,

36:52.210 --> 36:54.235
they may be startled,
disoriented.

36:54.312 --> 36:56.803
But they have to behave
like drones,

36:56.881 --> 36:58.849
or we could all be exposed.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.612
Our ships are scattered
across the galaxy.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.018
Most of us will be
the only drone on board

37:04.088 --> 37:05.282
who knows about this place.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.483
She's right.
What can we hope to achieve?

37:07.558 --> 37:10.425
We should each gather as much
tactical data as we can- -

37:10.494 --> 37:13.327
what kind of ship we're on,
its armaments, location.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.865
Then we'll coordinate
our efforts from here.

37:20.504 --> 37:22.199
lf all goes well,

37:22.273 --> 37:24.571
we'll be working
very closely together.

37:24.642 --> 37:26.610
As colleagues.

37:26.677 --> 37:28.542
Nothing more.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.184
Our previous...

37:34.252 --> 37:36.777
friendship...

37:36.854 --> 37:38.549
Yes?

37:38.623 --> 37:41.524
lt's irrelevant.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.526
''lrrelevant.''

37:43.594 --> 37:47.223
Well, now that l'll be able
to retain my memory,

37:47.298 --> 37:49.266
l'll keep that in mind.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.119
Report!

38:11.188 --> 38:13.315
Direct hit to their
shield emitters! No damage!

38:13.391 --> 38:15.086
lncrease phaser yield.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.592
Where's the Flyer?

38:16.661 --> 38:18.094
They're approaching.

38:18.162 --> 38:20.892
Heading 017 mark 3.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.201
Status?

38:32.276 --> 38:33.903
Voyager has sustained damage,

38:34.011 --> 38:36.275
but they are continuing
their assault.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.713
Come on, Chakotay.

38:38.783 --> 38:41.911
One of the cube's shield grids
is fluctuating- -

38:41.986 --> 38:44.079
ventral axis, secondary emitter.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.713
Cut primary power.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.781
Thrusters only.

38:56.701 --> 38:59.226
Tactical Cube 138
is under attack.

39:05.943 --> 39:07.638
Our forward shields are down!

39:07.712 --> 39:08.804
The Flyer.

39:08.879 --> 39:10.244
They're closing.

39:10.314 --> 39:11.508
50 kilometers.

39:11.582 --> 39:12.947
Maintain fire.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.751
30 kilometers.

39:15.820 --> 39:17.048
Twenty.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.282
They're in range.

39:21.058 --> 39:23.492
Enhance Grid 61 19.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.031
Captain...

39:28.099 --> 39:31.330
l expected something
more cunning from you.

39:31.402 --> 39:34.064
lt's time.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.402
Their ventral shield grid?

39:36.474 --> 39:40.069
Still fluctuating at
a rate of .06 terahertz.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.578
Align our transporters to match.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.011
Aye.

39:45.082 --> 39:46.709
They've detected them.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.492
They're inside.

40:04.568 --> 40:07.731
Direct hit to the port nacelle!
We're venting plasma!

40:07.805 --> 40:09.705
Should l back off?

40:09.774 --> 40:10.741
No.

40:12.209 --> 40:14.336
We need to stay close.

40:45.409 --> 40:46.433
They've adapted.

41:05.729 --> 41:07.321
Hull breach! Deck 1 1 !

41:07.398 --> 41:10.094
Aah! They're targeting
our warp core.

41:10.167 --> 41:12.965
No change yet.

41:26.984 --> 41:29.145
We'll have to take
the long way around.

41:31.355 --> 41:32.617
Tuvok.

42:23.874 --> 42:27.002
Their life signs
are destabilizing.

42:28.946 --> 42:30.914
So far, so good.

42:32.650 --> 42:34.777
You can take us
out of here now, Tom.
