<i>He's confident,
careful</i> and forensically aware.

00:05.580 --> 00:07.879
<i>I'd be very surprised
if he hadn't killed before.</i>

00:07.880 --> 00:10.829
<i>Your finger prints are all over
these screwdrivers.</i>

00:10.830 --> 00:12.940
You want to tell me
what the angled tips are about?

00:13.250 --> 00:14.550
No idea.

00:15.980 --> 00:18.949
This is corn-starch found on their
victim, Tina Lunt.

00:18.950 --> 00:22.219
And Clarissa's just retrieved
corn-starch powder

00:22.220 --> 00:24.019
from Lucy Chatham's turbinates.

00:24.020 --> 00:25.749
<i>We're working the same case.</i>

00:25.750 --> 00:28.339
If she wants to play happy
families with a junkie,

00:28.340 --> 00:29.700
that's her
prerogative.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.698
When you turned the alarm off,

00:32.700 --> 00:35.019
was Alec's Land Rover outside?

00:35.020 --> 00:36.824
You're getting in a state about
nothing.

00:36.825 --> 00:38.620
<i>Was it parked outside?</i>

00:40.500 --> 00:42.859
<i>Which night did you stay at the
guesthouse?</i>

00:42.860 --> 00:44.170

"Discovery"
Part 2 of2

01:24.800 --> 01:27.029
Massive trauma to the torso.

01:27.030 --> 01:28.779
Trauma to the face.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.869
Tyre tread marks on his clothing.

01:30.870 --> 01:32.170
And in the blood.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.979
If this is the same killer,
he's learning fast.

01:35.980 --> 01:37.289
How do you mean?

01:37.290 --> 01:39.860
He hit Lucy with his car,
but she survived.

01:41.260 --> 01:43.699
Multiple impact - he left
nothing to chance.

01:43.700 --> 01:46.869
So much for Beale being your
prime suspect.

01:46.870 --> 01:48.619
Just because
someone's killed him

01:48.620 --> 01:50.700
doesn't mean
he didn't kill Tina.

01:54.260 --> 01:56.534
Wasn't a chance robbery.

01:56.535 --> 01:58.799
There's a couple of
hundred quid in here.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.939
Which leaves what -
pre-arranged meeting?

02:01.940 --> 02:04.759
- With Wesley Beale doing the arranging.
- Says who?

02:04.760 --> 02:06.619
Well, he lives less than
a mile away.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.628
No CCTV, no prying eyes.
Feels like his call.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.269
If it's his choice of venue,
why's he the one that's dead?

02:12.270 --> 02:14.609
Someone he under-estimated?

02:14.610 --> 02:16.940
Wolf in sheep's clothing?

02:47.650 --> 02:52.650
POLICE NOT SEEKING FURTHER

LUCY CHATHAM BODY FOUND

03:33.500 --> 03:36.019
What are you doing in here?
How did you get in?

03:36.020 --> 03:38.969
- Set of keys in your coat.
- What coat?

03:38.970 --> 03:40.579
The one you keep in the
guesthouse.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.289
Mum was going to chuck
all your stuff out.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.690
I thought you might want it.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.420
Thanks.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.779
I think I know what Mum's
worried about.

03:55.780 --> 03:59.000
That the police will find out
you used to be Brett Porter.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.699
Mum was acting so weird,

04:01.700 --> 04:04.220
I decided to get some
answers for myself.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.619
Jessie...

04:07.620 --> 04:09.699
I've read all the articles.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.320
Only one thing I don't get.

04:12.300 --> 04:15.420
You were found innocent - so why did
you change your name?

04:18.459 --> 04:19.760
Jack.

04:33.850 --> 04:35.159
Guv.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.029
Remember what that girl said?

04:37.030 --> 04:38.339
Jessica Timpson?

04:38.340 --> 04:41.179
Big bloke watching her from
a black Fiesta.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.659
Yeah. We can get her to confirm
easily enough.

04:44.660 --> 04:48.189
So...what was Hounslow Wesley
doing in leafy Surrey?

04:48.190 --> 04:49.780
Getting petrol, for one.

04:50.580 --> 04:54.589
Dated yesterday morning.
A service station in Surrey.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.829
Isn't that near where Lucy
was run down?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.139
Yeah.

04:58.140 --> 05:00.049
And Alice and Jasper's flat.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.809
So, we've got a dead bloke
with form for dealing

05:02.810 --> 05:05.549
and a suspect with form
for possession and assault.

05:05.550 --> 05:07.679
Even if Beale was Jasper's
supplier,

05:07.680 --> 05:09.219
why would Jasper kill Beale?

05:09.220 --> 05:11.969
He ripped him off? A bad batch?
Any number of reasons.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.979
I'm still not seeing a motive.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.059
Beale's record includes
blackmail, yeah?

05:17.060 --> 05:18.839
Maybe he tries to shake
Jasper down

05:18.840 --> 05:21.349
cos he knows he's got something to
do with Lucy's murder?

05:21.350 --> 05:24.549
We know there is a link
between Lucy and Tina's murders.

05:24.550 --> 05:27.329
We know Beale was in both locales
very recently

05:27.330 --> 05:30.400
and we know he's in the drug
business. We need to talk to Jasper.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.420
The police did everything
they could...

05:35.920 --> 05:37.220
to pin it on me.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.730
The jury saw through it.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.864
Well, they must've
had something else...

05:42.865 --> 05:45.180
for you to be their main suspect?

05:46.820 --> 05:49.659
I'd picked up a conviction...
two years earlier.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.259
For,

05:51.260 --> 05:52.560
unlawful sex.

05:53.660 --> 05:55.819
It was all consensual,

05:55.820 --> 05:57.620
completely consensual,
but...

05:58.710 --> 06:00.019
..she was 15.

06:00.020 --> 06:01.819
Jess, I know, I know.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.869
But I...I...I was a different
person back then.

06:04.870 --> 06:07.339
Successful. I had half-a-dozen
bars in Brighton

06:07.340 --> 06:09.239
and the girls were just on tap.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.269
Shame you had to pick one
that was 15(!)

06:11.270 --> 06:13.059
It was a mistake.

06:13.060 --> 06:14.654
ONE mistake.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.239
Still.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.899
She didn't even want
to press charges.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.740
It was all down to her parents
and the police and...

06:28.020 --> 06:29.764
Ellie's right, though...

06:29.765 --> 06:31.499
about the missing girl.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.639
With all the police crawling around,

06:33.640 --> 06:36.189
they might find out
I use the guesthouse.

06:36.190 --> 06:38.899
So? So! If they do,

06:38.900 --> 06:42.549
it's best they don't know I stayed
there on Friday night

06:42.550 --> 06:44.920
and only you know that I did.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.619
You want me to lie?!

06:48.620 --> 06:52.300
The police are always looking
for another shot at me.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.280
Do you recognise
the service station, Jasper?

07:29.590 --> 07:31.780
It's down the road from my flat.

07:32.420 --> 07:35.420
What about the bloke filling up?
You recognise him?

07:38.520 --> 07:40.219
Forgive me for asking. What is it?

07:40.220 --> 07:43.380
Six, seven counts of possession
you've clocked up over the years?

07:44.760 --> 07:47.079
Go on. Indulge me.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.380
One last look.

07:50.740 --> 07:53.140
Maybe you remember him...

07:53.950 --> 07:55.250
more like this?

07:56.120 --> 07:59.099
We know from Lucy that you blow up
when things don't go your way.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.819
Is that what happened to Beale?
I don't know Beale!

08:01.820 --> 08:05.259
Did he think you were some sad, posh
junkie that he could just push around?

08:05.260 --> 08:07.789
- Did you put him straight on that score?
- Are you listening to me?!

08:07.790 --> 08:10.840
OK, OK. You say you don't know
him, I believe you.

08:12.980 --> 08:16.189
Where were you this evening,
say, from 8pm onwards?

08:16.190 --> 08:18.949
I've been at home all night with
Alice. That's not what SHE says.

08:18.950 --> 08:21.380
She says you didn't get home
until 11.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.560
So, who's lying?

08:26.020 --> 08:28.699
You left here under a bit
of a cloud, didn't you?

08:28.700 --> 08:31.149
Alice didn't want you in the same
car as her,

08:31.150 --> 08:32.580
let alone the same house.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.020
So where did you go, Jasper?

08:38.460 --> 08:39.899
Jesus...

08:39.900 --> 08:42.960
That's it... Get it off your chest.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.640
I went out to score.

08:45.980 --> 08:49.299
All that shit you put me through,
I needed a fix.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.859
But my dealer is not Wesley Beale.

08:51.860 --> 08:54.709
- And where does he reside, YOUR dealer?
- Brentford.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.579
42, Pixley Road.

08:56.580 --> 08:59.079
You lot have got cameras up
and down that street,

08:59.080 --> 09:00.539
for all the good it does you.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.909
So, unless I snuck out the back,

09:02.910 --> 09:07.199
hightailed it over to this, what...
Industrial estate...?

09:07.200 --> 09:10.039
Ran this poor chap over - not
forgetting I don't have my car -

09:10.040 --> 09:11.640
before quietly sneaking back...

09:13.220 --> 09:14.820
I think you'd better order me a cab.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.899
Hiya.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.499
Sorry it's late.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.419
Can you process that for me?

09:23.420 --> 09:24.720
Sure.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.959
What's it's, er, provenance?

09:29.960 --> 09:32.299
- Bit unusual.
- OK...

09:32.300 --> 09:34.769
It was dumped by a girl

09:34.770 --> 09:37.079
- only tangentially involved in the case.
- Right.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.139
If you just find one set of
prints, one set of female DNA,

09:40.140 --> 09:42.749
then no further action required.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.460
I see.
Getting soft in your old age?

11:03.700 --> 11:05.100
Where've you been?

11:05.700 --> 11:07.339
Visiting a patient.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.520
But you weren't on call tonight?

11:10.620 --> 11:11.939
Clive Jones.

11:11.940 --> 11:14.224
He seems to distrust
the younger doctors.

11:14.225 --> 11:16.500
And, it must be said,
they're not crazy about him.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.539
What's that car you're driving?

11:20.540 --> 11:22.479
I told you. Garage lent it to me.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.869
While they're fixing the VW.

11:23.870 --> 11:25.419
Right.

11:25.420 --> 11:26.920
What's wrong with it?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.709
The petrol gauge is playing up.

11:31.710 --> 11:33.540
Says "empty" when it's full.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.919
I asked Jess, point blank,

11:41.920 --> 11:44.070
which night she saw Alec
at the guesthouse.

11:45.980 --> 11:48.259
- She said it was Thursday.
- And?

11:48.260 --> 11:51.270
And I know her well enough
to know when she's lying.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.139
- Not this again...
- And I remember her being around on Thursday night.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.200
What are you saying?
That he got her to lie?

12:01.480 --> 12:05.289
- I think they've seen each other.
- Well, they've always been close.

12:05.290 --> 12:09.309
- At the very least, they've spoken.
- Why are you torturing yourself?

12:09.310 --> 12:11.090
If he was here Friday,

12:11.900 --> 12:14.140
that means he left Saturday morning.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.524
And that's when Lucy Chatham...

12:17.525 --> 12:19.380
So, we're back to that again?

12:23.500 --> 12:24.800
Ellie,

12:25.400 --> 12:27.099
you're worrying about nothing.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.400
Am I?

12:29.960 --> 12:31.280
How do you know?

12:48.300 --> 12:50.770
<i>That trust.
That love.</i>

12:51.540 --> 12:55.019
<i>I think you mean total,
undiluted dependence..</i>

12:55.020 --> 12:56.620
<i>I know love when I see it.</i>

12:57.860 --> 13:00.099
<i>God, you're such a softie!</i>

13:00.100 --> 13:03.339
<i>If we stopped feeding her
and the neighbours stepped in,</i>

13:03.340 --> 13:05.549
<i>- they'd get that look.
- That's just cynical...</i>

13:05.550 --> 13:07.139
<i>What're you saying?</i>

13:07.140 --> 13:09.139
<i>Our kids never love us?</i>

13:09.140 --> 13:10.440
<i>It's never real?</i>

13:11.900 --> 13:14.460
<i>What crap is Mummy spouting?</i>

13:15.060 --> 13:16.460
<i>Let me translate.</i>

13:17.980 --> 13:19.699
<i>"I love my Dad.</i>

13:19.700 --> 13:21.010
<i>"He's the greatest.</i>

13:22.050 --> 13:23.899
<i>'"He can do no wrong."</i>

13:23.900 --> 13:25.820
<i>What about Mum?!</i>

13:26.400 --> 13:28.599
<i>"On the fence about Mum."</i>

13:28.600 --> 13:30.360
<i>"On the fence"!</i>

13:32.370 --> 13:33.679
<i>Hello.</i>

13:33.680 --> 13:35.420
<i>Say "hello" to the camera.</i>

13:38.180 --> 13:41.709
<i>Look at you! Lovely girl!</i>

13:41.710 --> 13:43.420
<i>Yay!'</i>

14:51.840 --> 14:55.029
<i>Obviously, the discovery
of Lucy's body is a devastating blow</i>

14:55.030 --> 14:57.239
<i>to the family, but from
an investigative angle,</i>

14:57.240 --> 14:59.699
<i>we now have a wealth of new
evidence to work with.</i>

14:59.700 --> 15:02.540
<i>The net is closing in on this man,
make no mistake...'</i>

15:11.600 --> 15:13.139
Someone have a nightcap?

15:13.140 --> 15:15.809
I had a couple after you
went to bed.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.599
"Couple"!

15:17.600 --> 15:19.880
Shouldn't it be me
hitting the bottle?

15:30.020 --> 15:31.320
What is it?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.660
Nick...?

15:40.080 --> 15:44.040
I've had a lot of patients
die recently.

15:45.050 --> 15:48.000
Mostly of old age,
no great surprises, but...

15:49.200 --> 15:51.480
..people who meant a lot to me...

15:53.960 --> 15:55.580
I'm so proud of you.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.600
Is there anything else?

16:17.840 --> 16:19.759
This girl going missing,

16:19.760 --> 16:22.249
it's stirred up memories for me,
too.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.259
What Alec went through
when we were young...

16:24.260 --> 16:26.720
the trauma, the after-effects...

16:27.500 --> 16:30.009
..we all weathered that storm,
me included.

16:30.010 --> 16:32.049
I've always thought
you didn't like Alec.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.559
Back in the day, not much.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.759
Not sure he liked me much, either.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.020
Thought I was trying to cramp
his sister's style.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.419
That's not true.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.540
But I like the man he grew into.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.040
I like Alec.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.989
That's what matters, isn't it?

16:51.990 --> 16:53.290
Who we are today?

16:54.500 --> 16:56.340
In the here and now?

16:58.060 --> 17:00.860
Who'd like their younger self
if they met them in the street?

17:01.820 --> 17:03.820
I was a stuffy old git
when I was young.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.460
If I hadn't met you.
I would've stayed one.

17:38.870 --> 17:40.179
Yes.

17:40.180 --> 17:41.819
<i>Dr Timpson?</i>

17:41.820 --> 17:43.280
<i>Ali from the garage here.</i>

17:44.580 --> 17:46.499
Ali, hi...

17:46.500 --> 17:48.860
<i>Well, your car's ready,
all fixed.</i>

17:50.020 --> 17:51.340
Right. Great.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.739
<i>We can drop that off later</i>

17:53.740 --> 17:55.609
<i>and we'll pop the keys
through the letterbox</i>

17:55.610 --> 17:57.099
<i>if no-one's there.</i>

17:57.100 --> 17:58.819
No, no, I'll come and collect it.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.120
<i>It's no bother.</i>

18:01.940 --> 18:04.500
I'll come and collect it now,
thank you.

18:09.020 --> 18:12.969
I found two sets of prints and DNA
on the hash pipe and the clingfilm.

18:12.970 --> 18:14.900
What hash pipe? This one.

18:16.980 --> 18:19.579
I saw Jessica Timpson
get rid of a carrier bag

18:19.580 --> 18:21.679
in a bin just down the road
from her house.

18:21.680 --> 18:24.779
- She's the daughter of the guy whose car alarm went off.
- Yeah, I know who she is.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.879
I didn't want to take any action
unless it related to the case.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.280
That's my call, not yours.

18:30.380 --> 18:34.009
One set of prints scored
a match with a Brett Porter.

18:34.010 --> 18:36.849
Prime suspect
in the rape and murder

18:36.850 --> 18:39.459
of Leah Tyler
in Brighton in '96 -

18:39.460 --> 18:42.579
he now goes by the name
of Alec Porter.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.409
Name change.
Never a good sign...

18:44.410 --> 18:47.629
17-year-old Leah was walking home
when she was raped,

18:47.630 --> 18:50.219
bludgeoned and strangled
near Porter's house.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.909
Local offie recalled Porter coming
in for cigarettes at 3am.

18:53.910 --> 18:56.319
Right when the pathologist believed
that Leah was killed.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.119
When police got wind of
his unlawful sex conviction,

18:59.120 --> 19:01.529
and their interest doubled.
But he didn't go down for it?

19:01.530 --> 19:03.289
But swathes of the public still
thought he did it.

19:03.290 --> 19:05.299
Pretty clear the police did, too.

19:05.300 --> 19:08.620
Porter's prints showing up
could be just a coincidence.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.379
She's young, blonde and pretty -
just like Lucy.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.219
And she suffered blunt force
trauma to the head.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.219
Porter's vehicle's registered
in Brighton,

19:17.220 --> 19:18.829
but he's no stranger to Surrey.

19:18.830 --> 19:23.049
Last year, he got three points
going through a camera on the A34.

19:23.050 --> 19:26.029
A34, that's, what, half
a mile from Lucy's front door?

19:26.030 --> 19:27.889
Hang on, still leaves Tina Lunt.

19:27.890 --> 19:29.740
Maybe she was a witness?

19:31.540 --> 19:33.599
I know - well, I KNEW -

19:33.600 --> 19:36.099
the pathologist on the Leah Tyler
murder.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.550
Mike Liston.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.219
But?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.019
He's in Esher Open Prison.

19:41.020 --> 19:43.819
Got caught falsifying path reports,

19:43.820 --> 19:46.509
casting doubt on
all his previous cases.

19:46.510 --> 19:48.420
Including Leah Tyler's?

19:50.220 --> 19:51.979
Are you up for speaking to him?

19:51.980 --> 19:53.460
It might speed things up?

19:57.940 --> 20:00.109
Just sign some paperwork for us.

20:00.110 --> 20:01.820
I got my own. Thanks.

20:03.820 --> 20:06.420
Couldn't hold the page down for me,
could you? Oh, sure.

20:11.590 --> 20:12.899
Lovely.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.339
Good as new.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.589
You'd never know anything
ever happened.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.890
Great.
Thanks.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.700
Where's the key? Oh.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.379
You don't mind me asking
how the air bag went off?

20:25.380 --> 20:27.639
What...?
I've no idea.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.119
- Some kind of malfunction.
- That can happen,

20:30.120 --> 20:32.420
but we'd usually see it
when we strip it out.

20:33.370 --> 20:35.079
- OK...?
- There was nothing wrong

20:35.080 --> 20:36.599
with your air bag.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.770
Thanks so much, Ali. Key, please.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.459
Everything all right, Dr Timpson?

20:41.460 --> 20:43.980
Fine. Lots of patients to see.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.760
Thanks.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.740
Here you go, Dr Alexander.

21:07.820 --> 21:09.120
Thanks.

21:27.070 --> 21:28.379
Mike!

21:28.380 --> 21:29.820
You have a visitor.

21:31.340 --> 21:32.640
Thanks.

21:34.270 --> 21:35.579
Hi, Mike.

21:35.580 --> 21:37.229
Thanks for seeing me.

21:37.230 --> 21:38.530
Sit down.

21:39.910 --> 21:41.219
I...

21:41.220 --> 21:44.044
I was going to just read
the path report, but, um...

21:44.045 --> 21:46.869
You thought it might have been one
of ones I doctored?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.580
Well, it wasn't.

22:02.060 --> 22:03.570
Hello, Jessica.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.380
Hi...

22:06.500 --> 22:08.700
Do you know an Alec Porter?

22:11.260 --> 22:12.680
He's my uncle.

22:14.620 --> 22:17.819
He tore off her skirt and underwear,

22:17.820 --> 22:20.419
- and probably raped her.
- "Probably"?

22:20.420 --> 22:23.259
There was evidence of recent
sexual activity

22:23.260 --> 22:25.030
and the presence of semen.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.320
But as you know, rape is, er,
notoriously hard to prove.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.699
What about cause of death? Well,
I called that wrong to start with.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.299
At the scene,
I assumed the cause of death

22:35.300 --> 22:38.140
was blunt force trauma
to the skull...

22:39.820 --> 22:42.189
Think I might've thought the same...

22:42.190 --> 22:43.499
Yeah, well,

22:43.500 --> 22:46.099
I found a Yorkstone brick
in the undergrowth

22:46.100 --> 22:50.109
which matched the yellow brick
dust in Leah's wounds...

22:50.110 --> 22:53.059
The brick itself came from a pallet
on Porter's front drive -

22:53.060 --> 22:54.929
he was having his house extended.

22:54.930 --> 22:57.229
Another black mark against him?

22:57.230 --> 22:58.659
Big one.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.209
Yeah, but where the case against
Porter fell down

23:01.210 --> 23:02.899
was the semen deposits.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.019
Didn't match his DNA?
The police were not deterred.

23:06.020 --> 23:07.809
I mean, they formed a theory
that the semen

23:07.810 --> 23:10.259
came from an earlier sexual
encounter

23:10.260 --> 23:13.579
and that Porter wore a condom, or...

23:13.580 --> 23:15.939
he was unable to perform

23:15.940 --> 23:18.539
after a heavy night at his club.

23:18.540 --> 23:20.019
That might've explained his rage

23:20.020 --> 23:22.120
- and overkill.
- Well, it might.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.909
Anything else to support the theory?

23:24.910 --> 23:27.509
Leah had told a girlfriend
that she was seeing

23:27.510 --> 23:29.240
an older, married man.

23:30.250 --> 23:32.819
The police thought
the semen was his,

23:32.820 --> 23:36.629
but he'd never come forward,
for obvious reasons...

23:36.630 --> 23:37.979
He was never traced?

23:37.980 --> 23:39.280
No.

23:40.780 --> 23:43.989
Gun to the head,
do you think Porter killed her?

23:43.990 --> 23:47.459
Mmm, it always bothered me
we never ID'd

23:47.460 --> 23:49.760
the secretor
of the semen found on Leah.

23:50.860 --> 23:54.029
It bothered the jury, too.
It was a factor in his acquittal?

23:54.030 --> 23:55.779
The ONLY factor.

23:55.780 --> 23:58.980
Almost the definition
of "reasonable doubt".

24:00.355 --> 24:01.664
Thanks, Mike.

24:01.665 --> 24:02.965
I appreciate this.

24:03.870 --> 24:05.179
I...

24:05.180 --> 24:07.860
I...I don't feel sorry for myself.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.669
Only for the people I've let down.

24:10.670 --> 24:12.289
My family,

24:12.290 --> 24:13.900
my colleagues...

24:15.740 --> 24:17.099
When I was first sentenced,

24:17.100 --> 24:19.329
I had an answer for everything.

24:19.330 --> 24:21.379
I'd tell myself it wasn't fair

24:21.380 --> 24:23.420
to judge a man
by his worst decision.

24:24.430 --> 24:28.240
By a moment of weakness and greed.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.700
But now, I know better.

24:32.740 --> 24:36.360
It's our worst decisions
that define us, Nikki.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.460
They're the ones
we have to live by.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.499
Grace?

25:33.500 --> 25:35.100
It's me.
It's Nick.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.020
How have you been, Grace?

25:43.220 --> 25:45.460
You know.
Can't complain.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.159
Up to date with your pills?

25:49.160 --> 25:51.859
I've been using that timer
you got me. Good.

25:51.860 --> 25:53.920
Glad that's working out.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.580
What's happened here?

26:04.100 --> 26:07.069
I've been asking myself that
question all day.

26:07.070 --> 26:09.579
Have you put it in your journal?

26:09.580 --> 26:12.469
Be a blessing when the rest
of my memory goes...

26:12.470 --> 26:14.220
Oh, what sort of talk is that?

26:15.340 --> 26:18.139
The pipe, the dope -
it's all mine.

26:18.140 --> 26:20.779
You want to arrest me -
fine, go ahead.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.209
Don't drag Alec into it.

26:22.210 --> 26:24.469
He's been through enough shit,
thanks to you.

26:24.470 --> 26:27.159
- Some would say he got off lightly.
- You ruined his life.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.469
How is that getting off "lightly"?

26:28.470 --> 26:30.529
When did you last
see your uncle?

26:30.530 --> 26:33.179
In Brighton.
Two months ago.

26:33.180 --> 26:37.029
See, I think you've seen him more
recently. And not in Brighton.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.749
- No, Alec never comes to our house.
- Never?

26:39.750 --> 26:41.199
Not for ages...

26:41.200 --> 26:44.789
That's funny, a week ago,
he went through a speed camera

26:44.790 --> 26:46.820
half a mile from your front door.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.460
You sure he didn't drop in
for a cup of tea?

29:42.940 --> 29:44.950
- Ellie...
<i>- Where've you been?</i>

29:45.560 --> 29:48.019
<i>Why the HELL aren't you
answering your phone?</i>

29:48.020 --> 29:50.219
Sorry, I was with a patient...

29:50.220 --> 29:53.539
<i>Come home NOW.
The police are here.</i>

29:53.540 --> 29:57.099
The police?
Want do they want...exactly?

29:57.100 --> 29:59.644
<i>They went to arrest Alec
mob-handed.</i>

29:59.645 --> 30:01.979
<i>He lashed out and ran.</i>

30:01.980 --> 30:04.410
'They're still looking for him.

30:05.780 --> 30:07.099
'Nick?!'

30:07.100 --> 30:09.270
Yeah. I'm still here.

30:14.220 --> 30:15.579
What is that?

30:15.580 --> 30:17.020
This...

30:17.420 --> 30:19.730
is an air bag,

30:20.140 --> 30:21.500
minus its housing..

30:22.000 --> 30:23.659
Want to make yourself useful?

30:23.660 --> 30:25.020
Not particularly.

30:26.180 --> 30:28.620
Fridge over there. Top shelf.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.260
Thank you.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.340
You might want to stand well back.

31:03.540 --> 31:04.840
Three.

31:10.940 --> 31:12.240
Two.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.550
One.

31:32.940 --> 31:35.099
Clean entry wound.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.499
Barely torn the flesh.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.159
Sound familiar?

31:38.160 --> 31:39.469
Tina Lunt...

31:39.470 --> 31:41.859
The screwdriver was driven
into her with such force,

31:41.860 --> 31:44.229
it broke off the handle,
smashed through her sternum

31:44.230 --> 31:46.099
and scarcely tore the skin...

31:46.100 --> 31:48.740
Covering her in cornstarch powder.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.219
If Tina Lunt wasn't murdered,

31:52.220 --> 31:54.139
who moved her body and why?

31:54.140 --> 31:57.089
My money? Wesley Beale, for
reasons of self-preservation.

31:57.090 --> 31:59.119
The same powder was found
on Lucy Chatham -

31:59.120 --> 32:00.979
are we saying Beale killed HER?

32:00.980 --> 32:03.500
Well, I'm hoping Wesley
can provide some answers.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.800
Have a look.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.000
Right, this is what we know.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.619
Cause of death - chest and abdominal
injuries

32:12.620 --> 32:15.320
consistent with multiple
overrunnings by a vehicle.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.399
Look at these. These are different.

32:18.400 --> 32:21.464
They're older and the abrasions
are not consistent with a collision.

32:21.465 --> 32:24.519
He'd been struck repeatedly
by the same implement.

32:24.520 --> 32:27.184
Twin marks with a broadening
at one end...

32:27.185 --> 32:29.849
it's not a blade, or
we'd see deeper cuts...

32:29.850 --> 32:32.279
Is this a spanner?

32:32.280 --> 32:34.640
Well, a spanner is a contender,
certainly.

32:36.820 --> 32:40.059
Do you think we'd find a spanner
lying around Maconi's garage?

32:40.060 --> 32:41.460
Yeah, one or two.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.500
All right, Dan? All right.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.219
So, this...

32:47.220 --> 32:49.820
is a photograph
of Wesley Beale's back.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.859
I didn't kill him.

32:53.860 --> 32:56.869
Those wounds were sustained
some days before he died.

32:56.870 --> 32:58.779
Our money's on a spanner.

32:58.780 --> 33:01.789
I can't help you. Think of it more
as helping yourself.

33:01.790 --> 33:03.689
Beale's dead. Murdered.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.099
Those wounds...

33:05.100 --> 33:06.669
they're systematic.

33:06.670 --> 33:08.459
Controlled.

33:08.460 --> 33:09.939
Features associated with torture.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.319
In most juror's minds,

33:11.320 --> 33:14.379
from torture to murder's
but a hop and a skip.

33:14.380 --> 33:16.389
Added to which,
Beale was killed by a car,

33:16.390 --> 33:18.420
and you, well...

33:19.020 --> 33:20.940
You're in the car business.

33:24.460 --> 33:27.239
He owed me some money, OK?

33:27.240 --> 33:30.229
Ah, so, your lot thought beating
was a friendly reminder?

33:30.230 --> 33:32.620
Yeah!
Seemed to work, too.

33:33.330 --> 33:35.339
- Go on...
- He comes in yesterday,

33:35.340 --> 33:37.819
all cocky.
Pleased with himself.

33:37.820 --> 33:39.379
He's found a way to get my money.

33:39.380 --> 33:41.339
He's got some rich
bloke over a barrel.

33:41.340 --> 33:43.179
- He mention a name?
- No.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.299
You ask him what he had
on this bloke?

33:45.300 --> 33:48.250
He said it wasn't murder,
but it was as good as.

34:38.250 --> 34:41.399
- Nick, tell them! They won't listen!
- Tell them what?

34:41.400 --> 34:44.540
- Don't answer that, please.
- That we haven't seen Alec for months.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.359
Well? Is it true?

34:47.360 --> 34:50.059
Yes, we haven't seen Alec
for a good while.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.079
Fortunately, I don't have to take
your word for it -

34:52.080 --> 34:53.699
this is a warrant to search
the premises.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.009
- Shall we?
- Thank you.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.819
What are you expecting
to find, exactly?

34:56.820 --> 34:59.079
Well, whatever it is, we don't
need any help, thank you.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.380
Wait a second!

35:00.780 --> 35:02.719
I just spoke to your neighbours.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.459
They say your brother's
a frequent visitor

35:04.460 --> 35:07.459
- and stays in a guesthouse in the back garden?
- That's not true...

35:07.460 --> 35:10.649
- You don't have a guesthouse?
- We do, but Alec doesn't stay in it.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.609
So, when we process it
for prints and DNA,

35:12.610 --> 35:14.820
we won't find results
matching his profile?

35:15.420 --> 35:16.819
OK, Christ!

35:16.820 --> 35:18.620
Has he ever stayed there?
Yes, but...

35:18.950 --> 35:21.309
but not recently,
so it doesn't matter, does it?

35:21.310 --> 35:23.410
Can you show us the guesthouse,
please?

35:33.700 --> 35:36.139
One of your vehicles
have an oil leak?

35:36.140 --> 35:40.039
We had some friends staying last
week. It must be from their car.

35:40.040 --> 35:43.260
Right, you two, just take a couple
of paces that way, please. Thank you.

35:44.360 --> 35:45.834
She's lying.

35:45.835 --> 35:47.300
Yeah, no shit!

35:50.980 --> 35:53.319
Hi, can you check
under Alec's vehicle,

35:53.320 --> 35:55.160
see if there's an oil leak, please?

35:56.900 --> 35:58.200
Checking now.

36:05.590 --> 36:06.899
Yeah.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.760
OK, thank you.

36:10.580 --> 36:14.099
OK, just to clarify, no two
brands of oil are the same.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.859
So, if this oil comes
from Alec's vehicle,

36:16.860 --> 36:18.890
I'll be able to prove that,
chemically.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.119
One more time.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.480
When did you last see your brother?

36:24.800 --> 36:27.520
I think he may have stayed here
Friday night.

37:06.940 --> 37:09.330
Stop.
I'll let the dogs go!

37:10.140 --> 37:11.440
Stop where you are!

37:12.640 --> 37:13.940
Stop now!

37:14.980 --> 37:16.280
Stop!

37:36.020 --> 37:37.320
What is it?

37:38.020 --> 37:39.320
A hunch.

37:40.150 --> 37:41.459
- Thomas.
<i>- Jack.</i>

37:41.460 --> 37:44.759
<i>I think Tina Lunt was
killed by a deployed air bag.</i>

37:44.760 --> 37:46.139
<i>This morning, DS Wretzky'</i>

37:46.140 --> 37:49.219
said something about Timpson's
car alarm going off?

37:49.220 --> 37:51.679
A deployed air bag would
trigger the alarm.

37:51.680 --> 37:52.989
Exactly.

37:52.990 --> 37:55.779
How does this tie in
with Beale's murder?

37:55.780 --> 37:57.409
<i>Not sure.</i>

37:57.410 --> 37:59.119
<i>Seems like Beale
was blackmailing someone</i>

37:59.120 --> 38:00.600
<i>and it backfired.</i>

38:06.500 --> 38:09.539
I hear your car alarm went off
on Saturday morning?

38:09.540 --> 38:12.120
Just a malfunction.
Was no harm done.

38:14.380 --> 38:17.029
Had some work done recently?
Sorry?

38:17.030 --> 38:18.520
Seat covers in your car.

38:20.140 --> 38:21.934
Oh, petrol gauge was playing up.

38:21.935 --> 38:23.841
Saying it was empty when it wasn't.

38:23.842 --> 38:25.739
Covered your seats just for that?

38:25.740 --> 38:28.719
They know I'm a neat-freak.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.979
So, nothing to do with
the alarm going off?

38:30.980 --> 38:33.219
No. Same vehicle, though?

38:33.220 --> 38:35.419
Yeah.
Same vehicle.

38:35.420 --> 38:37.840
OK.
Thank you.

38:42.740 --> 38:44.169
Looks like Nick's had some

38:44.170 --> 38:46.059
- work done on his car.
- Right.

38:46.060 --> 38:48.940
Be good to know it had nothing
to do with air bags.

38:50.340 --> 38:52.540
OK. Where is he?

38:54.620 --> 38:56.459
Did you see where
Nick Timpson went to?

38:56.460 --> 38:57.760
No, why?

38:59.770 --> 39:01.079
Where's your husband?

39:01.080 --> 39:02.620
- What...?
- Where's Nick?

39:17.590 --> 39:18.899
Dad?

39:18.900 --> 39:21.029
I need you to come and pick me up,
sweetheart.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.859
<i>What's going on?</i>

39:22.860 --> 39:25.609
It's Alec. The police are hanging
round like a bad smell

39:25.610 --> 39:26.919
<i>and we need to warn him.</i>

39:26.920 --> 39:28.899
Where are you?
You sound weird.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.479
It's very important you don't
take any more calls, Jess.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.589
<i>- The police will be tracking your phone.</i>
- What...?

39:33.590 --> 39:35.220
Here's where I want you to
meet me.

39:39.300 --> 39:40.609
Where would Nick go?

39:40.610 --> 39:42.620
- I don't know.
- Think!

39:44.080 --> 39:45.799
I don't know where he'd go.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.550
I don't know WHY he'd go.
I don't know!

39:53.820 --> 39:55.200
What have you got?

39:55.900 --> 39:58.244
I've just called his mechanics -

39:58.245 --> 40:00.579
they fitted a new air bag yesterday

40:00.580 --> 40:03.639
as well as replacing the front bumper,
touching up the paintwork...

40:03.640 --> 40:07.339
It looks like Tina Lunt tried to
steal the air bag from Nick's car -

40:07.340 --> 40:09.339
killing herself in the process.

40:09.340 --> 40:13.429
The air bag propelled the
screwdriver into her heart.

40:13.430 --> 40:14.780
Accidental death?

40:15.900 --> 40:18.339
Wesley Beale,
her partner-in-crime -

40:18.340 --> 40:20.700
showed his true colours
and fled the scene.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.929
So, Jessica tells her dad
his car alarm is going off.

40:26.930 --> 40:28.319
He comes out to investigate
and then...

40:28.320 --> 40:30.800
<i>decides to remove
Tina's body from the car.</i>

40:38.180 --> 40:40.579
From the direction
Lucy was travelling in,

40:40.580 --> 40:42.559
she would have
turned into the lane

40:42.560 --> 40:45.600
and would have had a clear view
into the drive.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.800
<i>And then, Nick had another
problem on his hands.</i>

41:23.140 --> 41:24.659
<i>Why?</i>

41:24.660 --> 41:27.319
Why did he take Tina's body
out of the car?

41:27.320 --> 41:29.380
Why couldn't he call the police?

41:32.960 --> 41:34.260
Keep going straight ahead.

41:34.890 --> 41:36.199
Almost there.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.974
And turn left into the house.

41:37.975 --> 41:39.740
Where are we going, Dad?

41:40.720 --> 41:42.379
Somewhere safe.

41:42.380 --> 41:44.059
Alec will join us later.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.360
And Mum.

41:46.580 --> 41:48.100
It's all going to be OK!

41:52.580 --> 41:54.934
- I told you to turn that off!
- It's Mum!

41:54.935 --> 41:57.280
Doesn't she need to know
where to find us?

42:01.380 --> 42:03.180
Jessica's still not answering.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.800
Look...

42:09.780 --> 42:11.339
You're not in trouble, Ellie.

42:11.340 --> 42:12.899
We just need your help.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.499
OK.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.619
So, who would Nick turn
to when he's in a bind?

42:17.620 --> 42:18.920
Who are his mates?

42:20.940 --> 42:22.820
He doesn't really have any mates.

42:24.690 --> 42:25.999
Sounds weird, but...

42:26.000 --> 42:28.780
his best friends
are probably his patients.

42:30.260 --> 42:32.580
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too, Jessica.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.300
- Well, I'll put the kettle on.
- No, I'll do it.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.799
Nick? Mm-hm?

42:41.800 --> 42:43.850
Did you put something
in the burner...

42:44.160 --> 42:45.460
earlier?

42:46.740 --> 42:48.584
- What?
- After you left,

42:48.585 --> 42:50.079
I had a walk around

42:50.080 --> 42:52.070
and it had been used.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.509
Really?
You sure?

42:57.510 --> 42:59.379
Mm. It was hot.

42:59.380 --> 43:02.020
It looked like someone
had been burning clothes.

43:03.420 --> 43:04.720
Strange.

43:10.340 --> 43:13.149
- I think I shall call the police.
- The police?

43:13.150 --> 43:15.359
I'm sure that's not necessary.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.669
How do you know?

43:16.670 --> 43:19.860
If they're using the burner,
what else are they doing?

43:21.300 --> 43:24.279
You're right,
we should get to the bottom of this.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.639
- I'll call them in a minute.
- You don't have to do that.

43:26.640 --> 43:29.850
No trouble. If they get a call from me,
they'll take it seriously.

43:30.620 --> 43:31.920
Thank you.

43:33.060 --> 43:35.540
I'd be lost without your dad.

43:37.260 --> 43:38.779
I'm tired.

43:38.780 --> 43:40.280
Might have a sit down.

43:42.060 --> 43:44.420
When the tea's ready,
I'll bring it through.

43:47.180 --> 43:49.589
Why don't you want her
to phone the police?

43:49.590 --> 43:51.499
I told you...

43:51.500 --> 43:54.210
Alec's meeting us here.
They'll arrest him.

43:54.720 --> 43:58.069
Right.
I'm sorry I shouted in the car.

43:58.070 --> 44:00.379
It's OK. I'm just...

44:00.380 --> 44:02.379
worried about Alec.

44:02.380 --> 44:05.189
- And Mum.
- Sure.

44:05.190 --> 44:06.580
Me too.

44:09.660 --> 44:11.019
Would you...?

44:11.020 --> 44:14.680
Would you say I'm a good dad?
That I've been a good father?

44:15.590 --> 44:16.899
Course.

44:16.900 --> 44:18.379
You love me, don't you?

44:18.380 --> 44:20.220
- Dad...?
- Just...

44:20.940 --> 44:22.500
..tell me. Please.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.809
Yes.
I love you.

44:25.810 --> 44:28.149
- And nothing can change that?
- No.

44:28.150 --> 44:30.280
What's with all the weird questions?

44:34.160 --> 44:36.940
Whatever happens,
whatever people tell you...

44:39.300 --> 44:41.140
..you brought out the good in me.

44:42.980 --> 44:44.280
As a man,

44:44.880 --> 44:46.180
as a father.

44:48.140 --> 44:50.460
Raising you...
saved me.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.500
What do you mean?

44:53.980 --> 44:55.860
You gave me something to live for.

44:58.020 --> 44:59.420
What about Mum?

45:00.860 --> 45:02.220
Your mum...

45:03.700 --> 45:05.210
..couldn't help.

45:05.620 --> 45:06.920
Because...

45:07.980 --> 45:09.280
..in so many ways...

45:11.620 --> 45:12.920
..she was to blame.

45:16.700 --> 45:18.440
<i>You're not looking at...</i>

45:19.230 --> 45:21.689
<i>Tonight, police in Surrey have
launched a manhunt</i>

45:21.690 --> 45:23.359
<i>for the missing GP,
Nick Timpson,</i>

45:23.360 --> 45:25.619
<i>in connection with the murder
of Lucy Chatham.</i>

45:25.620 --> 45:29.540
<i>She was found dead yesterday
in a pond close to the M25.</i>

45:30.240 --> 45:31.799
You got the list of his patients?

45:31.800 --> 45:34.139
Yeah, it's a bloody mile long.

45:34.140 --> 45:37.239
I'd prioritise any farms
or residences

45:37.240 --> 45:39.099
- near farms.
- Why?

45:39.100 --> 45:43.669
There's what looks... and
smells like slurry under here.

45:43.670 --> 45:45.659
- That could've been there for weeks...
- Nope.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.949
The mechanics said they cleaned
it inside and out.

45:47.950 --> 45:49.379
These deposits were made today.

45:49.380 --> 45:50.689
<i>..them immediately.</i>

45:50.690 --> 45:53.340
<i>Police say the man
should not be approached.</i>

46:01.080 --> 46:02.780
Who are you phoning, Grace?

46:04.790 --> 46:06.099
Just a friend.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.460
- Which friend?
- I... I...

46:15.380 --> 46:17.029
Give me the phone, Grace.

46:17.030 --> 46:18.330
No.

46:26.980 --> 46:28.740
Give me the phone.

46:39.070 --> 46:40.379
OK?

46:40.380 --> 46:41.880
- Dad.
- Yes?

46:42.980 --> 46:44.900
Brett and Mum aren't coming,
are they?

46:51.860 --> 46:53.180
What's the matter?

46:53.680 --> 46:55.180
What's going on?

46:56.400 --> 46:58.919
When I was small,
you always said,

46:58.920 --> 47:01.400
"A problem shared
is a problem halved."

47:01.840 --> 47:03.949
Some problems can't be shared.

47:03.950 --> 47:06.040
Look, whatever it is,
I can take it.

47:07.420 --> 47:08.740
I can help you.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.740
Your mum.

47:19.420 --> 47:22.629
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

47:22.630 --> 47:23.930
The best thing.

47:25.380 --> 47:28.200
I had to pinch myself that
she was...you know...mine.

47:30.100 --> 47:31.400
But deep down...

47:33.220 --> 47:35.480
..I knew it was too good to be true.

47:36.260 --> 47:39.500
That there'd be...a...a reckoning.

47:40.940 --> 47:42.500
A price to pay.

47:44.680 --> 47:47.010
I just didn't know it
would hurt so much.

47:47.420 --> 47:48.920
What do you mean?

47:50.260 --> 47:51.700
What price?

48:00.220 --> 48:01.574
I love you.

48:01.575 --> 48:02.920
Dad...!

48:04.500 --> 48:05.800
Let's go back to the car.

48:10.380 --> 48:12.380
No! No, no!
Stop!

48:15.010 --> 48:17.260
- God...
- I told you not to go in there!

48:19.140 --> 48:20.440
Jess...

48:21.980 --> 48:23.410
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48:25.220 --> 48:26.774
Jess!
Talk to me!

48:26.775 --> 48:28.320
Are you OK?

48:36.180 --> 48:37.480
Jess!

48:39.980 --> 48:41.280
Jess!

48:46.380 --> 48:47.680
Jess!

48:54.360 --> 48:56.059
Nick Timpson, I'm arresting you

48:56.060 --> 48:59.300
on the suspicion of the murders
of Lucy Chatham and Wesley Beale.

49:00.660 --> 49:02.359
You don't have to say anything,

49:02.360 --> 49:04.469
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention

49:04.470 --> 49:06.759
when questioned something which
you later rely on in court.

49:06.760 --> 49:09.320
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.840
Put him in.
Put him in.

49:42.780 --> 49:44.820
I need to take a DNA swab sample.

49:47.460 --> 49:48.940
Of course.

49:56.620 --> 49:57.980
Open your mouth.

50:00.260 --> 50:02.500
I need you to open your mouth.

50:05.200 --> 50:06.500
Open.

50:53.700 --> 50:55.999
I had a chat with
Tina Lunt's stepdad.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.939
All the way from Florida.

50:57.940 --> 51:01.469
Aw. She was more appreciated
than we thought.

51:01.470 --> 51:03.540
- That's something.
- Yeah, yeah, it is.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.660
God bless
Professor Jeffreys, eh?

51:07.300 --> 51:09.509
The forefather of DNA profiling.

51:09.510 --> 51:11.500
I know who he is, Einstein!

51:12.770 --> 51:14.170
Well, this is me.
CAR ALARM CHIRPS

51:16.080 --> 51:18.260
- I've got something for you, Maureen.
- Yeah?

51:29.660 --> 51:31.980
I will have to do some work now,
won't I!

51:34.040 --> 51:37.079
We've got news on your
brother's condition.

51:37.080 --> 51:40.189
He's going to have serious
and lasting injuries,

51:40.190 --> 51:41.490
but he's going to live.

51:43.060 --> 51:44.360
And...

51:45.580 --> 51:46.880
..there's something else.

51:48.580 --> 51:50.739
We've taken Nick's DNA

51:50.740 --> 51:54.019
and it's a match to the man
who raped and murdered Leah Tyler

51:54.020 --> 51:56.259
in Brighton in 1996.

51:56.260 --> 51:59.340
The murder your brother
was charged and acquitted of.

52:01.740 --> 52:03.040
That's impossible.

52:04.140 --> 52:06.179
DNA doesn't lie, I'm afraid.

52:06.180 --> 52:08.739
Now we know why Nick
removed Tina's body.

52:08.740 --> 52:10.049
If he'd called the police,

52:10.050 --> 52:12.489
they'd have processed his car
and found his DNA...

52:12.490 --> 52:14.939
which would have linked him
to Leah's murder.

52:14.940 --> 52:16.624
But Nick wasn't there.

52:16.625 --> 52:18.300
He was in London.

52:20.420 --> 52:23.160
He was doing his finals,
and that's why I...

52:24.900 --> 52:27.579
That's why I came down to see Alec.

52:27.580 --> 52:29.139
<i>We went out to his club...</i>

52:29.140 --> 52:31.140
Cheers, mate. Thanks very much.

52:32.980 --> 52:35.389
<i>..and I met
an old boyfriend there.</i>

52:35.390 --> 52:36.690
Here we are.

52:50.900 --> 52:53.099
Get a room,
you two!

52:53.100 --> 52:55.899
- Down the hall on the right.
- Where are you going?

52:55.900 --> 52:59.339
Going to get some fags.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

52:59.340 --> 53:01.020
'And Nick wasn't there.'

53:02.180 --> 53:03.620
He was in London.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.620
He was doing his finals in London.

53:08.780 --> 53:10.484
Well, clearly he was there.

53:10.485 --> 53:12.180
You just didn't know it.

53:13.260 --> 53:14.739
And the question is,

53:14.740 --> 53:16.220
why didn't you know?

53:18.140 --> 53:21.040
What was the state of your
relationship with Nick at the time?

53:29.100 --> 53:30.769
He was studying every night...

53:30.770 --> 53:32.740
but at the same time,
he was...

53:40.420 --> 53:42.300
He was very possessive.

53:47.460 --> 53:48.820
We fell out about it.

55:11.980 --> 55:13.280
Where is he?

55:17.100 --> 55:19.940
WHERE IS HE?! Where is he?!

55:27.460 --> 55:29.900
He's the father of my child.

55:31.780 --> 55:33.380
He's my husband.

55:37.780 --> 55:39.340
How could I not know it?

55:42.580 --> 55:44.340
How could I not see it?

55:47.020 --> 55:48.550
How could I not know?!

55:49.660 --> 55:51.220
How could I not know?

55:58.300 --> 56:00.264
How long has she been in there?

56:00.265 --> 56:02.219
Looks like an indentation of an H.

56:02.220 --> 56:04.569
<i>Cos there's no way that's
a coincidence, is it?</i>

56:04.570 --> 56:06.209
<i>Two young women.
Two friends.</i>

56:06.210 --> 56:07.699
It has to be the same killer.

56:07.700 --> 56:10.549
<i>I wouldn't hurt her, OK?</i>
I never touched her.

56:10.550 --> 56:12.419
That's better!
Some reaction!

56:12.420 --> 56:14.739
<i>You want her to have been
murdered, don't you?</i>

56:14.740 --> 56:18.380
- I want to know the truth.
- No. <i>You want to be right.</i>

56:19.550 --> 56:23.670
I will do everything I can
to find her, I promise!
