00:07.007 --> 00:10.593
No detailed information has been received
from the centre of Barcelona so far.

00:10.803 --> 00:15.765
A whole building has been closed off
as a preventative measure

00:16.015 --> 00:17.934
due to an unknown virus...

00:18.102 --> 00:20.228
...more than 20 people are trapped
inside the building.

00:20.312 --> 00:25.024
Other than the residents inside,
there are police officers and fire fighters

00:25.109 --> 00:29.278
and among them, two TV reporters
that are accompanying them...

00:29.363 --> 00:32.907
It has not been clarified as to
what type of virus it is.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.036
Neither the authorities
nor specialists have yet been able...

00:37.496 --> 00:40.748
...according to the last contact with the
inside, there may be only one survivor.

00:40.833 --> 00:45.128
It appears to be the TV reporter
who entered the buiIding with the firemen

00:45.838 --> 00:48.798
in order to cordon off a secure area
of severaI bIocks around the buiIding.

00:48.966 --> 00:54.011
We can confirm that the situation
is now under miIitary controI.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.806
We're in.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.559
Roger, proceed.

01:03.856 --> 01:04.897
Let's go.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.327
Guzman, Lucas, third floor.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.788
Cover me.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.627
In here.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.797
All set...

01:30.674 --> 01:32.508
2nd floor, devices planted...

01:33.677 --> 01:35.011
Going up, third floor.

01:49.568 --> 01:53.154
Lucas. Lucas. Shit!

01:54.531 --> 01:57.700
-Lucas. What the fuck were you doing?
-Done.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.870
-Devices planted.
-Roger!

02:01.288 --> 02:02.330
Let's go.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.750
-What's that?
-Shit, shit, shit.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.919
Proceeding to activate detonation.
You have four minutes to evacuate.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.045
Go, go, go!

02:15.219 --> 02:17.762
Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.941
Are you okay? Can you breathe?

02:30.025 --> 02:31.526
Let's get out of here.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.610
Now!

02:35.781 --> 02:36.781
Shit!

02:38.242 --> 02:41.577
I don't have a shot!

02:52.339 --> 02:54.423
Shoot! Shoot!

02:56.844 --> 02:58.094
Shit!

03:11.984 --> 03:13.609
You're a doctor,

03:15.153 --> 03:16.779
you can help me.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.329
Evacuate. Three minutes remaining.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.791
The rules.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.470
Do it. Do it. Do it!

03:43.974 --> 03:46.017
Come on, we have to get out of here.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.813
Help me! I'm up here!

03:50.981 --> 03:53.024
It's her. We can't leave her here.

03:53.108 --> 03:56.402
No, no, don't even think about it.
There's no time!

03:56.486 --> 03:59.030
-Get out of here! I'll handle it.
-You're crazy.

04:02.868 --> 04:03.910
Fuck!

04:30.228 --> 04:32.521
Okay, okay, it's okay.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.945
You have to trust me, okay?

04:39.738 --> 04:41.072
One minute until detonation.

04:41.156 --> 04:44.533
Look at me. Look at me!
We're going to get out of here.

04:53.627 --> 04:59.382
REC: APOCALYPSE

05:21.571 --> 05:22.571
Hello, Angela.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.740
It's okay,

05:25.534 --> 05:28.369
they're to stop you from hurting yourself.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.254
That's it.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.594
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.264
No.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.475
Stay still.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.270
No. No.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.735
It's all right.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.410
Where am I?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.955
We just want to make sure you're okay.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.292
Let her rest.

07:32.119 --> 07:36.539
Pardon me.
Could you tell me where the wedding is?

07:37.249 --> 07:41.127
I think I must have drunk too much.

07:41.378 --> 07:44.922
My daughter-in-law sent me for a lie-down,

07:45.215 --> 07:47.550
and I think I've overslept.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.219
Sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:50.720 --> 07:55.224
I don't know where I am. It must be my head.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.146
Okay, neither do I know where we are.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.481
Then we're in a bit of a fix.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.025
Have you seen anyone else around here?

08:08.321 --> 08:12.158
Okay, how about this?
I'll go and try to find out where we are.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.078
You stay here. Stay calm and wait.
Someone will come and get you soon.

08:16.413 --> 08:20.749
Okay, but if you see my daughter-in-law,
tell her I'm here.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.211
-Don't let them forget me.
-Yes, yes, I'll tell her.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.772
How is she?

08:44.441 --> 08:46.942
She's awake. She seems calm.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.489
We're wasting our time.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.617
This is the third test
and all have come out negative.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.535
The girl's fine. There are no signs...

08:56.620 --> 08:58.954
She was exposed for over six hours in there.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.458
We have to make sure.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.434
They really hurt.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.814
Okay. I'll loosen them a bit.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.460
Stop!

09:54.511 --> 09:55.761
We've got a problem in the infirmary.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.179
The girI's gotten out.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.603
Get her. Use your weapons if necessary.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.398
How much longer?
It's processing, two minutes.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.203
-I've got her, she's heading upstairs.
-Hold it!

10:28.253 --> 10:29.628
Come on!

10:32.173 --> 10:34.008
She's heading for the dining room corridor.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.140
Stop! Don't move!

10:45.854 --> 10:46.937
Run.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.063
Go, go, go!

10:48.732 --> 10:50.691
Go, go.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.070
Stop!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.115
-You!
-Out of the way!

10:58.199 --> 11:00.743
We've got her. I said move!
Can't you hear me?

11:00.910 --> 11:03.120
-Help me!
-I said move!

11:06.833 --> 11:08.167
-After them!
-Hold it!

11:08.752 --> 11:09.752
Shit.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.337
Come on, come on!

11:12.922 --> 11:14.423
Let's go, move it!

11:18.928 --> 11:21.597
Stop! Hands up! Don't move!

11:21.681 --> 11:24.224
Stay there! Don't move!

11:26.478 --> 11:29.646
-We've got her. Awaiting orders.
-What is this? Where the hell are we?

11:30.273 --> 11:33.525
Lower your weapons.
We have the test results. She's clean.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.820
-Who are you?
-Take her to her cabin.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.616
-You should get some rest.
-No!

11:41.117 --> 11:44.953
It's okay, no more restraints, I promise.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.589
I asked you who you were.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.927
Please accept my apologies.
I'm Dr Ricarte, the medical protocol...

12:00.011 --> 12:02.179
I want to speak to my superiors.

12:08.645 --> 12:12.815
-Your superiors sent you here, I'm afraid.
-And my partner?

12:13.024 --> 12:17.820
I assume you're referring to Corporal Lucas.
We had to carry out some extra tests.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.071
Just routine.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.739
You'll be able to see him soon.

12:20.824 --> 12:24.451
Why? What the hell are we doing here?
This wasn't part of the operation.

12:24.536 --> 12:28.038
It's the only way to ensure total isolation
and you know it.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.499
Isolation from what? We're clean, aren't we?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.917
You've obviously already checked.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.712
The situation is more complicated
than you think.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.757
There was another outbreak
close to Barcelona.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.427
Luckily, we have it under control,

12:41.511 --> 12:44.430
but we can't make any more mistakes.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.599
Don't tell me, a wedding.

12:47.725 --> 12:51.937
Only one survivor,
but I see you've already met.

12:52.021 --> 12:56.191
Well! New passengers. How wonderful!

12:57.152 --> 12:58.861
And now if you'll excuse me,

12:59.279 --> 13:03.657
I'm sure Captain Ortega would be delighted
to show you his boat.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.742
Captain.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.122
I imagine you boarded with that group
at the last minute?

13:10.415 --> 13:14.376
-So it would seem. I'm Guzman.
-Come, I'll show you around.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.980
So you're in charge here?

13:35.064 --> 13:37.399
Don't be fooled. The ones in charge
are the ones with the money.

13:38.026 --> 13:41.445
And those doctors are paying me
enough to retire on.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.573
Forty years at sea are a lot.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.368
So after this, I'm going home.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.829
So the doctors are in control.

13:50.914 --> 13:54.917
And just so we don't forget,
they've brought their own little army.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.503
I believe you've already had the pleasure.

14:08.806 --> 14:09.848
How are we doing?

14:09.933 --> 14:13.602
28 knots.
North-easterly wind coming in stronger.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.522
In a few hours
we'll be entering a low pressure area.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.773
Very good.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.859
Reduce speed to a minimum,
with any luck it'll pass us by.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.403
Sure. We're not in any rush.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.156
Gorostiaga is our bridge officer.
From Bilbao.

14:26.449 --> 14:30.702
-A good man!
-"Pilot," it's easier. And call me Goro.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.497
-That bruise doesn't look good.
-This?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.959
Tell the imperial soldiers out there,
this is their work.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.293
-Have you put something on it?
-No.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.462
I think you should put
some antiseptic on there.

14:40.630 --> 14:45.133
Listen to the man, he's a doctor.
Specialises in viruses and things like that.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.970
Here we go again.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.683
I'm afraid this boat's too old
to throw such a party.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.893
No. Not too old.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.770
The problem is that
they're overloading the generator

14:56.854 --> 14:59.690
with all that medical equipment
they've got in the hold.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.484
-What happened?
-Power cuts.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.486
It's been happening since we set sail.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.656
It's worse at night.
Sometimes it goes down for a long time.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.534
They're setting up
some kind of lab down there.

15:10.660 --> 15:15.205
-What medical equipment?
-Like I said, it's none of our business.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.970
Pardon me.

15:30.680 --> 15:35.767
I don't mean to trouble you.
But, have we met?

15:36.269 --> 15:37.311
No.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.939
With so many people I get confused.

15:42.191 --> 15:47.070
Are you on my grandson's side
or the bride's?

15:51.868 --> 15:54.870
Did you have a bit too much to drink?

15:56.039 --> 15:59.124
Don't worry dear, me too!

16:24.776 --> 16:27.027
Nic. Nic!

16:28.446 --> 16:30.864
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.951
Nic is the radio operator,
despite his appearance.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.871
Yeah, though there's not much for me to do.

16:38.247 --> 16:43.126
Those assholes coded the frequency
as soon as they got here, so...

16:43.753 --> 16:45.253
You're saying we're cut ofF?

16:45.797 --> 16:48.757
So much so
that we don't even have lifeboats.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.468
I guess they hadn't told you that.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.761
They're inoperative.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.097
They blocked the offloading mechanism
before we set sail.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.556
Those were their conditions.

16:57.100 --> 17:01.103
Yeah, what was it?
Security... Security protocol.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.604
Pure bullshit.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.731
How are you getting on with the camera?

17:05.441 --> 17:07.275
I'm working on it, but it's going to take time.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.821
The camera still works,
but the hard drive's pretty busted,

17:11.906 --> 17:14.574
so I'm going to have to do it frame by frame.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.242
A pain in the ass!

17:16.327 --> 17:20.288
Nic is also our IT man.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.208
The doctors asked him to recover
the recording from the camera.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.335
They seem very interested in it.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.297
I found it next to the girl.
God knows what's on it.

17:29.507 --> 17:30.757
No way...

17:31.342 --> 17:33.552
So you're the guy who saved Angela Vidal?

17:34.345 --> 17:35.595
Something like that.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.347
You don't know how happy you've made him!

17:37.432 --> 17:40.225
I'm such a huge fan of that chick.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.686
When I'm on land, I never miss her show.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.605
And when you're not, she comes to visit,
isn't that nice?

17:46.482 --> 17:47.774
Let's see.

17:48.985 --> 17:53.530
So if you saved her,
you must know her pretty well, right?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.490
Well, more or less.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.077
I mean, maybe you could introduce me?

18:00.163 --> 18:01.705
Sure. Of course.

18:04.459 --> 18:07.878
Check this out. We've got a Filipino DJ.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.421
They come cheap apparently!

18:09.505 --> 18:12.841
The chef. That's the dinner bell,
you'll get used to it.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.692
-Depths ofthe sea, how can I help?
-How's it going down there?

18:30.860 --> 18:33.653
Worse and worse.
I don't even know where to start.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.615
You'd better tell them to keep calm up there.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.867
Calm is not an option, I assure you!

18:39.285 --> 18:41.495
Come up and get some dinner.
You can carry on Iater.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.539
Okay, whatever you say.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.422
Here.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.134
It's all there is!

18:57.220 --> 19:01.598
I don't usually eat much dinner.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.353
A glass of warm milk is more than enough.

19:07.188 --> 19:10.106
Right. Hey, you!

19:10.775 --> 19:13.068
Could you bring this lady a glass of milk?

19:13.945 --> 19:14.945
Milk?

19:15.029 --> 19:17.280
And some cookies, if you have any.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.658
While you're there, see if there's
anything else to eat.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.827
Some meat, or sauce even.

19:23.579 --> 19:28.124
This isn't an all-inclusive cruise!
Don't forget it.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.504
Take it easy.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.508
-Where the hell were you?
-And you?

19:37.844 --> 19:38.927
Yeah.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.682
-Have you spoken to my daughter-in-law?
-No.

19:46.644 --> 19:51.815
I know it's one of those modern weddings,
but this is too much.

19:52.441 --> 19:57.654
-Milk and cookies.
-Wonderful! Thank you dear!

19:58.906 --> 20:01.157
Ma'am. There's sugar over there.

20:01.576 --> 20:05.120
Really? I'll go and get some.
A little bit won't hurt.

20:11.210 --> 20:15.714
She's completely disoriented.
She's got no clue where she is.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.549
Somebody should talk to her.

20:18.217 --> 20:22.178
Yeah? And tell her what?
That her whole family's dead?

20:26.684 --> 20:28.310
I've just seen the ship's captain.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.062
They made him immobilise the lifeboats.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.064
And cut all radio communication.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.150
What?

20:35.276 --> 20:38.612
That's what I heard.
And they've set up a lab in the hold.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.489
This was supposed to be
a precautionary quarantine, right?

20:42.450 --> 20:46.369
-What kind of lab?
-They're hiding something.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.747
Otherwise why so much security?

20:49.999 --> 20:52.000
Haven't you seen the cameras?

20:52.877 --> 20:54.085
They're all over the boat.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.421
You can't even take a piss
without them watching you.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.675
They're pissing me off.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.096
Maybe it's not such a bad thing.

21:15.858 --> 21:19.986
So, looks like you got it working. Good job.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.116
You know you could work
for naval intelligence. Maybe I could...

21:25.201 --> 21:27.786
-Seriously?
-Well, you never know.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.372
Wow! Naval intelligence!

21:31.707 --> 21:33.458
Listen, I was wondering...

21:33.542 --> 21:36.294
Do you think you could access
the security cameras from here?

21:37.546 --> 21:38.964
Who do you take me for?

21:39.048 --> 21:40.715
Well, it's just that before, I saw you looking.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.469
That was the first thing I did!
I keep myself entertained!

21:44.971 --> 21:46.680
How do you think I knew she was here?

21:47.723 --> 21:50.809
-Unbelievable!
-Don't forget to introduce me. You promised!

21:50.893 --> 21:52.310
Yeah, yeah, of course.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.230
And the lab?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.569
The door's locked and security coded.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.822
Seems they don't want us
sticking our noses in.

22:04.532 --> 22:08.201
They've done a good job down there,
but they didn't count on Nic.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.913
Go, Nic! There you have it.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.459
Any idea what they're up to in there?

22:16.544 --> 22:20.922
No idea, but I saw them
taking a load of cages in there.

22:21.424 --> 22:25.510
-God knows what they need cages for.
-Cages.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.932
And that door? You know what's behind it?

22:31.392 --> 22:34.352
No idea, there are no cameras in there.
But look.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.481
This is the maximum zoom we can get.

22:42.194 --> 22:46.448
-200%. Not bad, eh?
-No, not bad at all.

22:48.451 --> 22:52.954
-Can you do that with all the cameras?
-Which one do you want?

24:06.112 --> 24:10.824
No, not now. Here we go again.

25:19.268 --> 25:20.476
What the hell is going on?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.730
I don't know what the fuck you do
down here all day,

25:23.814 --> 25:26.941
but that should be fixed by now.
The whole system's down.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.944
Really? I hadn't noticed.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.654
Is he fucking with us?

25:33.157 --> 25:37.410
Maybe where you come from,
people don't know much about hard work,

25:37.536 --> 25:39.204
but here we do things differently.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.207
So fucking sort it out!

25:46.462 --> 25:51.674
I'm from Spain and here things are done
however I fucking feel like it!

25:52.635 --> 25:54.177
You heard what I said.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.054
Hurry up and sort it!

26:11.111 --> 26:13.321
No, no, it's all right, it's me.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.492
What are you doing here?

26:18.327 --> 26:19.702
I got scared.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.665
Everything's okay. I'm with you, okay?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.918
-Let's go back to the cabins.
-Wait!

26:28.921 --> 26:31.256
Don't tell them, please.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.511
Listen to me, nobody's going to hurt you.
Nobody.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.638
Let's go.

27:28.856 --> 27:33.651
-This is going to be a force eight, I bet you.
-And it's coming straight for us.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.737
-Looks like it.
-Shit.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.448
It's going to be here before expected.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.286
What did you expect? It's my last voyage...

27:43.370 --> 27:46.039
I couldn't go out without a bang!

27:46.332 --> 27:47.915
I don't like the look of it.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.918
-Excuse me.
-Morning.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.422
-Morning.
-This is Angela.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.257
-Hello.
-Hello.

27:56.425 --> 28:00.762
-We've heard a lot about you!
-That over there is Goro.

28:01.430 --> 28:04.515
And over there is your number one fan.
Or so they tell me.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.892
Indeed he is.

28:06.894 --> 28:11.147
Well, sometimes I watch your show.
I'm Nic.

28:11.315 --> 28:12.648
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.692
Nic's downloading the images
from your camera.

28:14.777 --> 28:17.278
Well, trying to.

28:18.906 --> 28:22.700
My camera? It's here?

28:30.125 --> 28:33.336
Do you normally watch them later?
I mean on TV?

28:34.004 --> 28:35.338
-No.
-No, of course not.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.218
My favourite was the one
with the garbage men, it was so funny!

28:40.469 --> 28:41.844
When you jumped

28:42.971 --> 28:44.305
in that container,

28:44.431 --> 28:45.890
the guy couldn't believe his eyes!

28:46.058 --> 28:47.266
Brilliant TV!

28:52.981 --> 28:54.690
-Want one?
-No.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.579
Sorry to ask, but you wouldn't mind,
would you?

29:08.789 --> 29:09.789
What?

29:09.873 --> 29:13.084
If you could do that "Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.
Welcome to..." thing,

29:13.168 --> 29:15.002
but personalised for me.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.839
I know it's stupid but it'd make my day!

29:19.174 --> 29:21.884
No, leave it, maybe later.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.805
You must be sick of people
asking you to do it, I understand.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.808
-Damn it!
-Sorry.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.144
What a klutz. No, it was me. It's okay.

29:32.229 --> 29:36.691
It's waterproof,
or at least it's supposed to be.

29:37.234 --> 29:38.484
In case we sink!

29:46.326 --> 29:49.704
-Have you seen it?
-I saw some of the images.

29:50.581 --> 29:54.876
I don't know what it's all about,
but I'm glad I wasn't there.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.426
That's it!

30:05.387 --> 30:06.387
Done!

30:06.722 --> 30:09.724
Now I just have to put them in order.

30:10.017 --> 30:13.060
Twenty-five frames per second,
it'll take a little while.

30:15.772 --> 30:18.399
-How long?
-Not long, an hour or so.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.401
Maybe less.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.112
Sure you don't want one? It tastes good.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.252
Let's go.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.968
It's gone! The host is gone!

30:46.678 --> 30:48.679
What the hell are you talking about?

30:49.056 --> 30:50.765
-Raise the alarm!
-No!

30:51.934 --> 30:53.976
We need to stay in control.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.728
Close everything down.

31:28.887 --> 31:32.473
The restraints aren't broken.
Someone let it out.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.058
That's impossible.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.102
They couldn't have got round
the security system.

31:36.186 --> 31:39.021
-We'd have seen them.
-Not if it was during the blackout.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.023
What about the security code?

31:42.568 --> 31:45.444
-How many people know the code.
-Very few.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.738
Who would do such a thing?
It makes no sense.

31:47.823 --> 31:51.659
Come with me.
Get the Taser and the retroviral.

31:51.743 --> 31:55.454
-What are you going to do?
-Find it before it attacks someone.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.374
We'd better hope this works.

33:39.518 --> 33:43.771
-Hey! What's up with the food?
-What do you mean?

33:44.314 --> 33:47.942
That Filipino's fucking about.
We've been here 1 0 minutes and still no food.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.156
Edwin?

33:56.702 --> 34:01.539
What the hell? Have you seen this mess?

34:08.045 --> 34:10.464
At least it looks like
you made an effort today.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.592
Are you high or what?

34:16.638 --> 34:19.806
The dining room's full
and they're starting to get hungry,

34:19.891 --> 34:22.560
so you'd better get moving.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.020
I'll take this to the dining room,

34:25.147 --> 34:27.898
but get a move on or the shit will hit the fan.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.583
Yes! Nice one!

34:48.335 --> 34:49.335
Go, Nic!

34:59.014 --> 35:01.432
Lamb! Now we're talking, gentlemen!

35:01.516 --> 35:03.934
I hope you've left some for us.

35:04.019 --> 35:07.605
Second shift starts in 20 minutes.
If you hurry, you'll miss the jarheads!

35:07.856 --> 35:08.856
What?

35:09.357 --> 35:11.025
How are you feeling today?

35:14.196 --> 35:16.864
They think I don't know what's going on.

35:19.576 --> 35:22.161
They've put me in a home

35:23.955 --> 35:26.707
without even telling me.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.879
Are you feeling hungrier today?

35:32.005 --> 35:35.090
No, it's not a question of hunger,

35:35.175 --> 35:37.760
it's a question of my stomach.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.679
Could you talk to the waiter?

35:41.223 --> 35:45.768
See if he could make me some pasta,
or an omelette?

35:46.353 --> 35:49.230
I'll go see. But I can't promise anything!

35:53.360 --> 35:56.946
Hello? Hello?

36:18.176 --> 36:21.595
Hi, sorry, I was wondering
if there was anything else?

36:21.763 --> 36:24.431
The old lady's got a delicate stomach.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.809
Something grilled would be good or...

36:44.703 --> 36:45.786
Shit!

36:51.835 --> 36:54.128
Come on, just have a taste and then decide.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.926
It doesn't smell half bad.
Credit where credit's due.

37:01.136 --> 37:05.472
-No! No! Don't eat it!
-What's wrong?

37:05.640 --> 37:08.475
The chef's like the people in the building!
He tried to bite me!

37:08.560 --> 37:09.977
Lucas, did he?

37:11.229 --> 37:12.938
No. No.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.857
-Has anyone eaten anything?
-No.

37:15.692 --> 37:16.817
Okay, stay here.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.194
-Wait! Wait!
-Stay with her!

37:21.948 --> 37:23.324
Don't move!

37:24.451 --> 37:26.327
-What happened?
-You tell us.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.621
This was supposed to be
a precautionary quarantine.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.164
Tell me what happened.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.958
The chef tried to bite me,
that's what happened.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.543
Do you know what this means?

37:36.421 --> 37:37.421
Where is he?

37:37.714 --> 37:40.841
In the kitchen.
I managed to shut him in the refrigerator.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.680
Okay. Come with us.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.349
Just you.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.355
It's here already.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.692
This is going to be a hell of a party.

38:01.029 --> 38:04.949
-Are you okay?
-I don't know. I don't feel well.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.536
-Must have been something I ate.
-I'm not surprised.

38:10.038 --> 38:13.290
-Probably that worm you get from raw fish.
-Anisakis.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.919
-What?
-The worm's called Anisakis.

38:17.003 --> 38:21.715
-Whatever you call it.
-But we didn't have fish today.

38:22.300 --> 38:27.221
You should go and lie down.
I'll take care of everything.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.064
A retroviral. That's what we've been doing.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.861
We've managed to control two outbreaks
in 24 hours,

38:42.946 --> 38:47.074
but we might not be so lucky next time.

38:47.242 --> 38:50.035
How did you do it?
We don't know anything about the virus.

38:50.203 --> 38:54.498
We know more than you think.
We have a sample.

38:55.417 --> 38:59.336
We injected it into a healthy host
and waited for the symptoms to appear.

38:59.546 --> 39:02.339
Hang on. A sample?
Where did you get it from?

39:02.424 --> 39:05.551
That's not important. What's important
is that someone let the host out,

39:05.635 --> 39:08.178
and now we're in big trouble.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.597
-Fucking awesome!
-Give him the Taser.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.766
There's no more time to lose.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.811
-What are you going to do?
-Test the retroviral.

39:17.522 --> 39:21.650
As soon as I open the door, shoot.
The shot will paralyse him,

39:22.235 --> 39:24.361
-but only for a few seconds.
-Okay.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.448
Ready? Now!

39:37.834 --> 39:39.043
Out of my way!

39:56.269 --> 39:57.603
Come on! Get out!

40:09.616 --> 40:11.909
What the hell happened?

40:11.993 --> 40:14.411
The virus is feeding, getting stronger.

40:14.496 --> 40:18.707
-Shit! That's not possible!
-Obviously it is!

40:21.294 --> 40:23.378
It should have worked.
We followed all the steps.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.089
You've obviously lost control.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.883
So call whoever you need to
and get us the hell out of here!

40:28.009 --> 40:32.179
-He's right. Tell them to come and get us.
-You know the rules.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.432
Nobody's coming to get us.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.185
Not now.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.675
Let's get back to the Iab.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.051
We have to find out what went wrong.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.095
Hey! Wait a minute! And what about us?

41:14.347 --> 41:16.181
We don't know if the food is infected.

41:16.266 --> 41:17.808
We can't take any risks.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.560
No, no, no. No one's eaten anything.

41:19.644 --> 41:23.689
-It's true. I got here in time. I swear.
-Then there's no need to worry.

41:23.773 --> 41:27.901
-No need to worry? We're the second shift!
-You can't leave us here.

41:28.069 --> 41:32.156
As I said, we can't take any risks. Let's go.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.158
Wait, wait!

41:36.077 --> 41:39.788
I brought you what you asked for.
You can't do this to us.

41:39.956 --> 41:43.083
-What the fuck is he talking about?
-I'm sorry.

41:44.419 --> 41:50.007
-Let's go. There's no time to lose.
-Lucas? What have you done?

41:51.426 --> 41:53.385
I took a blood sample from the building.

41:53.595 --> 41:55.512
They told me I had to, for all our sakes.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.055
You took infected blood?

41:57.140 --> 42:00.017
Just a small sample. They said they
needed it before blowing up the building.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.101
Who?

42:02.187 --> 42:03.770
It's not just a simple virus.

42:04.272 --> 42:06.440
Some priests came to see me. I saw photos.

42:06.608 --> 42:08.859
Things you can't even imagine!
That shit's not what you think.

42:09.110 --> 42:12.279
-What else?
-They know what they're doing.

42:12.447 --> 42:17.451
-They're financing this whole thing.
-Son of a bitch! And now what?

42:17.619 --> 42:18.619
Okay.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.914
I don't know what's going on here,
but where are your manners?

42:21.998 --> 42:24.124
You don't know what's going on here.

42:25.460 --> 42:31.256
Well maybe it's about time you knew
your whole family's dead!

42:31.341 --> 42:32.507
Dead!

42:32.634 --> 42:34.134
-Leave her alone!
-Enough!

42:37.555 --> 42:39.056
I don't care what that shit is,

42:39.140 --> 42:42.643
but if the food is infected,
we're really screwed.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.522
Okay, we'll go up to the bridge
and stay there.

42:47.607 --> 42:48.857
Captain Ortega will help us.

42:48.942 --> 42:52.986
Really? And how? We're unarmed!

42:57.492 --> 42:59.660
Grab anything that we can use. Hurry!

43:33.361 --> 43:35.779
-Here.
-That's not going to help us.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.572
Well, it's all we've got. Let's go!

43:37.824 --> 43:39.074
Let's go! Let's go!

43:39.867 --> 43:40.993
Let's go!

43:59.262 --> 44:02.055
I don't mean to be rude,

44:02.598 --> 44:05.726
but I think I'm going to go and lie down.

44:11.733 --> 44:14.109
-Get back, get back.
-Go, go, go!

44:16.988 --> 44:19.698
Get back, get back!

44:26.831 --> 44:28.123
Get off me!

44:36.049 --> 44:37.257
Get back!

44:57.236 --> 45:00.280
-Come on. We have to reach the bridge.
-Go, go, go!

45:01.115 --> 45:03.283
They're all over the ship.
It's like a fucking plague.

45:03.493 --> 45:05.744
-Where's Goro?
-I don't know. He wasn't feeling well.

45:05.995 --> 45:08.246
-I told him to go and rest.
-Shit!

45:08.498 --> 45:11.375
-Depths of the sea, yes?
-Everything okay down there?

45:11.793 --> 45:14.086
I haven't even stopped to eat,
if you caII that okay.

45:14.170 --> 45:18.298
-Good, stay there. Don't move until I tell you.
-What's going on?

45:18.424 --> 45:19.633
Do as I say.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.137
Lock the door.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.622
-Come on, this way.
-Are you sure?

45:50.706 --> 45:52.290
Yes, move it!

45:52.375 --> 45:55.836
Could you ask my children to come
and get me?

45:56.838 --> 46:01.007
-We're almost there. Just a few meters.
-Tell them I won't be any trouble.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.300
Let's go!

46:20.069 --> 46:21.361
Now what?

46:21.446 --> 46:24.030
Have you got nothing better to do
than piss me ofF?

46:26.200 --> 46:27.367
Hey! What are you doing?

46:59.775 --> 47:01.568
Help me!

47:03.321 --> 47:04.488
I can't.

47:04.906 --> 47:06.531
-Shoot it!
-I can't! I can't!

47:06.699 --> 47:07.908
Get it off me!

47:09.160 --> 47:10.744
What's that?

47:13.789 --> 47:15.415
Let it go! Let it go!

47:20.880 --> 47:22.172
What the hell's that?

47:23.424 --> 47:25.759
Machine room, loss of oil pressure.

47:26.052 --> 47:27.093
Just what we needed!

47:57.250 --> 47:59.209
Get out! Let go!

48:02.964 --> 48:04.047
Shit!

48:04.966 --> 48:05.966
What was that?

48:07.009 --> 48:09.010
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.723
Where is she?

48:15.393 --> 48:18.144
-She's gone.
-Fuck me!

48:18.437 --> 48:19.437
What are we going to do?

48:20.147 --> 48:22.649
You go up to the bridge.
I'll look for her.

48:22.858 --> 48:24.943
Hey! Where the fuck are you going?

48:25.111 --> 48:28.446
You're unarmed, she's got no chance.
It's suicide.

48:28.531 --> 48:30.657
We can't leave her. Someone has to go.

48:34.704 --> 48:36.454
I fucked up.

48:38.624 --> 48:40.208
I owe you.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.050
Let's go.

49:09.030 --> 49:11.990
It's us! Open up!

49:12.742 --> 49:15.243
-Wait!
-It's us! Open the door!

49:15.536 --> 49:18.330
-We don't know if they're infected.
-Open up! Open the door!

49:18.497 --> 49:19.539
Nic!

49:23.127 --> 49:26.087
Come on! Close it! Close it now!

49:28.049 --> 49:31.343
What the hell's going on out there?
The quacks have fucked us over, right?

49:31.427 --> 49:34.596
The situation's changed.
From now on, you're back in charge.

49:34.722 --> 49:38.642
-We're going home.
-I wish I could. The engine's leaking oil.

49:39.268 --> 49:40.769
If it overheats, it could catch fire.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.021
-I have to turn it off.
-No!

49:43.147 --> 49:45.440
-Calm down!
-You don't know what that thing is!

49:45.524 --> 49:46.733
Wait!

49:48.027 --> 49:50.737
-We could try the backup engine.
-Start it up.

49:50.821 --> 49:53.239
I can't from here.
It can only be started from the engine room.

49:53.366 --> 49:54.866
Shit! Shit!

49:56.077 --> 49:59.913
What the fuck is this?
You were in the building, you should know!

49:59.997 --> 50:03.124
I don't know anything, but those doctors do.

50:03.417 --> 50:06.419
If we're going to stand any chance,
we need to know what they know.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.672
Oh, sure! How shall we do that?

50:08.756 --> 50:10.840
Are you going to go out there
and take a survey?

50:14.470 --> 50:17.472
Their computers.
Do you think you can access them?

50:24.939 --> 50:27.440
They put me online to send them
the camera images.

50:27.608 --> 50:28.942
They've handed it to us on a plate.

50:30.444 --> 50:33.905
Okay, it's what I thought.
The system's encrypted and reinforced.

50:34.115 --> 50:36.032
-What's that?
-Nothing serious. I hope.

50:38.411 --> 50:42.831
I don't understand, everything's in order.
It should have worked.

50:43.207 --> 50:46.626
Maybe the virus mutates
according to the host's DNA.

50:48.671 --> 50:50.922
That would make each strain different.

50:52.967 --> 50:56.594
We need the original strain,
free of mutations.

50:57.805 --> 51:03.017
The girl. And obviously, we don't have her.

51:04.228 --> 51:08.440
Gentlemen, it's game over.

51:08.733 --> 51:13.236
No, wait. There must be another way.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.990
I'm very sorry. You know the protocol.

51:23.164 --> 51:27.459
-No!
-Twenty minutes. Make the most of them.

51:27.543 --> 51:30.962
No, listen!
We could try to modify the DES1 enzyme,

51:31.088 --> 51:33.006
then the membranes will become more rigid

51:33.090 --> 51:34.758
and we could delay the virus
reaching the DNA.

51:34.842 --> 51:37.761
That will just slow down the process.
It won't help.

51:38.304 --> 51:41.765
Not without the original strain. I'm sorry.

51:42.016 --> 51:45.143
Please. You can't.

51:45.352 --> 51:49.022
There was no room for error.
You know the rules.

51:49.899 --> 51:52.692
Wait! The boy's done it!

51:53.861 --> 51:55.862
We've got the camera images.

51:58.991 --> 52:00.992
Go, Nic! All yours.

52:05.039 --> 52:07.707
How can I find the oldest files?

52:07.958 --> 52:10.126
Let's see. Here.

52:12.713 --> 52:14.214
What is all this?

52:16.467 --> 52:18.635
-What the fuck?
-Wait, wait.

52:19.929 --> 52:21.763
I saw that name in the building.

52:24.058 --> 52:25.225
In the attic.

52:26.060 --> 52:28.394
There were newspaper cuttings
with that name.

52:32.733 --> 52:36.778
It's her! It's the same girl.
The place was full of her photos.

52:38.072 --> 52:40.323
Information about a hospital admission,

52:40.991 --> 52:43.451
ordered by the Diocese of Naples.

52:43.869 --> 52:44.869
Priests?

52:44.954 --> 52:46.955
Parascientific diagnosis,
what the fuck is this?

52:47.081 --> 52:48.122
Wait.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.211
The cuttings were about the girl
being possessed or something.

52:54.755 --> 52:57.674
About the Church. The Devil.

52:57.758 --> 53:00.885
-Stop fucking around, man!
-It makes sense.

53:02.012 --> 53:04.222
They admitted her to get
medical confirmation.

53:04.974 --> 53:06.933
The doctor in charge...

53:09.061 --> 53:11.062
What a surprise.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.868
What's that?

53:25.995 --> 53:29.622
-It can't be.
-Yes, it can. It's the girl.

53:32.793 --> 53:36.129
-What the hell was she doing there?
-Rewind.

53:43.971 --> 53:47.515
What is this? God!

53:53.397 --> 53:57.066
-A parasite.
-The source of the virus.

53:57.985 --> 53:59.986
It was right in front of our noses!

54:00.321 --> 54:02.196
This was the devil they were searching for?

54:02.907 --> 54:04.240
A parasite?

54:04.366 --> 54:08.494
That thing was controlling the girl's body
and mind and used her as a transmitter.

54:08.996 --> 54:11.164
But it kept her immune to protect itself.

54:11.332 --> 54:12.457
Clever.

54:13.459 --> 54:16.836
It's been growing inside the girl
all these years.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.923
Until it found a better host.

54:21.675 --> 54:26.262
The original strain. We've got it!
Get everything ready. Surgical material.

54:26.555 --> 54:30.183
We have to get that thing out of her.
We can still stop this!

54:37.358 --> 54:42.946
Ma'am. Ma'am, come on.
We have to find the others.

54:43.530 --> 54:44.572
You have to trust me.

55:09.556 --> 55:11.557
No, no, no.

55:23.696 --> 55:25.154
Fuck you!

55:27.950 --> 55:29.242
Don't move!

55:33.122 --> 55:36.290
Drop your weapon and turn around slowly.

55:41.922 --> 55:44.424
Where's the girl?

55:47.928 --> 55:49.345
On a cruise!

55:53.434 --> 55:55.393
Last chance.

55:56.270 --> 55:58.312
Where is she?

56:00.232 --> 56:02.233
What's wrong? No answer?

56:03.068 --> 56:04.736
And there's not going to be.

56:04.945 --> 56:06.946
Then we have to go down there
and do it ourselves.

56:07.156 --> 56:08.489
We have to start that engine.

56:08.615 --> 56:12.285
Easy.
Except I'm not planning on going out there.

56:13.162 --> 56:14.537
And what do you suggest?

56:14.621 --> 56:16.914
We just wait here for those things
to come get us?

56:16.999 --> 56:19.000
Listen, this was my last voyage.

56:19.460 --> 56:22.003
And no one wants to go home more than me.

56:23.338 --> 56:24.797
But I want to make it alive.

56:26.842 --> 56:28.009
Open up!

56:29.136 --> 56:30.470
-Lucas.
-Open up, please!

56:35.225 --> 56:38.603
-Hey, hey! What are you doing?
-Nobody touch her!

56:38.687 --> 56:40.855
Get away from her. Stand aside!

56:40.939 --> 56:43.399
-What's going on?
-It's a parasite.

56:43.609 --> 56:45.610
It's inside her. It's the source of the virus.

56:45.694 --> 56:46.736
What?

56:47.196 --> 56:49.405
-What are you talking about?
-We saw it on the video.

56:49.490 --> 56:52.742
How it went inside her.
You can see for yourself...

56:52.826 --> 56:56.621
What are you talking about?
You said she was clean.

56:56.705 --> 56:59.791
She is. That thing keeps its host immune.

56:59.875 --> 57:04.670
That's how it goes unnoticed.
Careful! We need her alive!

57:04.797 --> 57:06.339
Tell them to let her go.

57:14.848 --> 57:17.809
-You're making a mistake.
-Let her go.

57:19.812 --> 57:21.562
That gun's not loaded.

57:21.647 --> 57:22.939
But this one is.

57:24.608 --> 57:28.319
Don't you understand?
This parasite's the original strain.

57:28.403 --> 57:30.863
It's the only way to make the retroviral.

57:30.948 --> 57:33.449
That's why it didn't work before.
There's no other way.

57:33.534 --> 57:36.828
-I don't care.
-Please be reasonable.

57:37.079 --> 57:40.081
We only have to extract it.
She doesn't need to get hurt.

57:40.165 --> 57:43.292
-No, no, no! They're lying!
-You're a doctor.

57:43.377 --> 57:47.588
You have experience controlling epidemics.
You know this is the only way.

57:57.724 --> 57:59.642
We'll never get her to the lab like this.

57:59.726 --> 58:01.894
On that table. We'll do it there.

58:03.105 --> 58:05.815
-Hurry!
-Nic! Nic!

58:05.899 --> 58:07.108
Be careful!

58:11.530 --> 58:13.156
-On her back.
-Help me!

58:13.323 --> 58:14.824
Grab her head.

58:21.331 --> 58:23.791
Tie her down. Like that. Good.

58:24.501 --> 58:28.921
-Wait a minute, and if it's a mistake?
-I told you, it's on video.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.883
You can see it yourselves.
Time's running out.

58:32.259 --> 58:33.259
Nic!

58:33.468 --> 58:34.468
Hold her down.

58:35.929 --> 58:38.389
-I can't find it.
-We saw it. It has to be there.

58:38.765 --> 58:39.807
Doctor.

58:56.909 --> 58:59.493
Don't move. Push her head back.

59:09.755 --> 59:11.756
-I need towels!
-In the bathroom.

59:11.840 --> 59:13.299
Quickly!

59:26.772 --> 59:29.148
Hurry! Hold her down!

59:29.483 --> 59:30.816
What the hell's going on?

59:42.120 --> 59:43.120
Help me!

59:43.205 --> 59:45.206
I don't have a shot!

59:47.960 --> 59:50.002
Shoot! Shoot!

59:50.504 --> 59:51.837
What's going on?

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.268
Get her!

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.238
Don't let her escape!

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:53.024
It's superficial. It's nothing.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:01:00.865
Wait. The DES1 will work.
You said so yourself.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:04.118
We can still find the girl
and make the antidote.

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.912
You know there's no time.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:11.459
You still need me.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.211
Not any more.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:24.555
-And now what?
-Now we find the girl!

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:28.934
No! This is over.
Stop fucking around and call for help.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.271
-You're the only one who can use the radio.
-Not without an antidote.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:34.523
You'll never do it. You're crazy.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.942
Well if I don't,

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:40.529
I can assure you that very soon
there'll be nowhere to go back to.

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.116
Let's go! We're wasting time.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:50.122
Walkie-talkies on frequency 9.
She can't have gone far.

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:24.448
Shit!

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.996
Okay, fuck this. Can you pilot the ship?

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:36.919
I can try, I've helped a couple of times,
but I don't know.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:46.637
Okay, we'll go down and get the backup
engine started. Do you know how?

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:50.516
I think so.
But I can't go down there, I'm sorry.

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:54.311
He's right, all we have is four kitchen knives,
which won't take us very far.

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:56.772
-Are you fucking kidding?
-Any better ideas?

01:02:56.857 --> 01:03:01.110
Wait, there's some fishing material
stored on the stern deck.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.028
Fucking great! Now we're going fishing!

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:06.157
Okay, you stay here.
We'll go and grab whatever we find.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.660
We'll come back
and then all go down to the engine room.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:14.540
Lock the door. We need you alive,
you're the only one who can pilot this ship.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.383
Stern, this way.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:29.221
This is a fucking maze. We'll never find it!

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:34.059
Over there!

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.659
Got her! She's in the cabin corridor.

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:53.245
-Where?
-Cabin corridor.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:54.955
Let's go! Let's go!

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:13.015
No! Shit! She's smashing the cameras!

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:14.517
We've lost her.

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:24.693
Where is she?

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.616
Shit!

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:58.727
Got her! Dining room corridor.

01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:00.813
Go, go, go!

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:15.828
Quickly! Hurry!

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.585
AngeIa, no! Here!

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:23.961
It's Nic.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.755
The walkie-talkie, pick up the walkie-talkie.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:33.095
Pick it up!
Come on, come on, pick it up. Do it!

01:05:33.305 --> 01:05:36.098
Okay! Now, dial 7.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.683
Dial 7, come on!

01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:40.269
Dial 7, dial 7!

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.062
Nic?

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:44.481
Good. We're alone now.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:45.858
I can see you.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.818
But I can't help you
if you smash the cameras.

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:50.404
-Okay.
-Now get the heII out of there.

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:51.947
They're coming for you.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:53.782
What the fuck are you doing?

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.285
You have to get out of there!
They're right behind you!

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:02.625
What are you doing?
They'II be there any minute!

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:06.045
AngeIa, Iisten to me.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.838
You have to get out of there right now.

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:09.006
Go!

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:18.557
Why did you do that?

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:23.312
Come on!

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:33.656
-Go, go!
-Take this!

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.955
What the fuck are you doing, Lucas?
Come on! Let's go!

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.084
It's party time!

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:49.546
Where is she? How did you lose her?
She was here!

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:51.465
Careful!

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.510
Where the hell is she?

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:01.058
Help!

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:04.103
Fucking help me!

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.356
Get it off me!

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.108
The fire extinguisher!
Get the fire extinguisher!

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:11.610
Move!

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:14.029
Hurry!

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:17.616
Help!

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:21.954
-I don't know how it works.
-Its head! Hit it on the head!

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:34.967
You're wrong.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:39.680
I don't know what you want from me,
but you're wrong.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:55.863
Now check it.
Go back to your fucking lab and check it.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.657
Then tell them to leave me alone.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.835
I'm sorry.

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:21.220
-What now? We're unarmed.
-Go home.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:22.555
Wait!

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:25.684
What happened to your hand?

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:33.358
You've been bitten.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.612
Nic? Are you there?

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.613
AngeIa, fuck! I saw you!
Why did you do that?

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.826
You have to trust me.
I need the access code to the lab.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.202
What?

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:28.205
Fuck! I have to prove to them
that they're wrong!

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.415
-But...
-Please!

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:34.044
But you bit him, AngeIa.
I saw it on the camera.

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:35.379
Trust me, Nic!

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:40.259
We can get out of this together.
But I need that code.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.926
Please.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680
Nic!

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:49.059
Okay. I've got it.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:54.398
Guzman showed me how to get it
from the camera above the door.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:59.611
Here it is.
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.451
It can't be.

01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:23.927
-It can't be.
-Yes, it can.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:26.763
I saw it on the video.

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:30.434
-I saw it enter your body.
-I don't care what you saw.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:33.312
I don't know what you're Iooking for,
but it's not me.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:04.593
-Harpoons.
-Yes, harpoons

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.053
Is that all?

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.265
-Okay.
-Fine.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.393
We'll go down there,
you'll get the engine started and we're done.

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:14.770
And then go home.

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:18.690
Hang on. Angela's okay.
There's nothing in her.

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:21.109
Ricarte checked, I saw it on the camera.

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:22.945
They're in the lab.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:24.488
We have to go and get her.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:29.618
Okay, I'll go.
You two go down to the engine room.

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:31.495
We'll meet back here.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.127
Now tell them!

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:42.172
It's impossible. There must be a mistake.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:44.341
There's no mistake.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:49.680
Tell them right now to leave me alone
or I swear I'll kill you.

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:52.057
Tell them now!

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.850
Tell me what?

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.735
The parasite leaves its host
when it finds a better one.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:07.739
She was the best way
to get it out of the building.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.702
The video doesn't lie. We've all seen it.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:15.372
I don't care what you saw
but your tests don't lie either.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:16.832
That's true.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:19.501
If it were inside her you'd be infected.
She bit you.

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:23.714
I know! But there must be an explanation.

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:28.802
She's lying.

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:36.601
Is that true, Angela? Are you lying?

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.816
And you? Are you lying?

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:48.030
Why did you want the lab access code?

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:52.701
You asked Nic for it. What for?

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:55.454
I wanted to know what they were
doing in there. Didn't you?

01:12:56.706 --> 01:13:00.292
Last night in the corridor, you were coming
back from the lab, weren't you?

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.130
You used the power cut
to let the monkey out.

01:13:05.757 --> 01:13:09.384
Really? And why would I do such a thing?

01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:15.515
You rescued me from the building.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:18.977
We were alone almost a minute.

01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:23.648
If that thing was in me...

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.820
It leaves its host when it finds a better one.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.489
Wasn't that it?

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:31.948
Exactly.

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:36.787
So the old host is of no more use.

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:46.922
You're brave Angela, I love that...

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.174
Auto-destruct protocoI activated.

01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:50.801
Twenty minutes.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.928
AII personneI evacuate immediateIy.

01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:54.513
It's over.

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:56.306
Fuck you!

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.242
Where do you think you're going, Angela?

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:20.664
Careful with that, don't hurt yourself.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.358
Evacuate immediateIy.

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:50.110
Now it's party time.

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:55.824
Detonation in 18 minutes.
Evacuate immediateIy.

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:48.270
Wait!

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.744
Get back! Get back!

01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:27.809
Come on, Nic! Let's go!

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:40.572
This way.

01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:45.660
-Is this it, Nic?
-Yes.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:50.165
-Hurry, hurry! Shit!
-What? What's wrong?

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:53.335
Nic, what's wrong?

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:54.461
It won't start.

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.755
What do you mean?
You said you knew how to start it!

01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:58.757
I said I could try and that's what I'm doing!

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.383
Don't try! Do it!

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:18.860
Hurry, hurry, come on!

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.946
Quickly! Shit!

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:23.948
Fuck!

01:18:27.787 --> 01:18:28.787
Give me that!

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:34.834
Quickly, Nic!

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.212
Holy shit! The motor! Start it!

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:50.183
Help, Nic!

01:19:03.864 --> 01:19:07.617
-No, no! Not now!
-Nic!

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:18.628
Evacuate immediateIy.
Detonation in 13 minutes.

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:27.345
Evacuate immediateIy.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.848
Detonation in 13 minutes.

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:29.949
Evacuate immediateIy.
Detonation in 10 minutes.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:32.911
Evacuate immediateIy.

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:37.415
No! No! I'm okay!

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:42.045
-Where's Angela?
-I don't know. Listen, we can get out of here.

01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:44.714
The ship's about to explode.

01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:49.594
Look, it's an inflatable life raft.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:51.179
We can use that motor.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.097
Where's Angela?

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:57.852
Forget her! You can't help her now.
Look out for yourself.

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:02.565
You and I can get out of here.
We still have time.

01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:07.070
Come on!

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:10.448
Fuck you!

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:19.916
Go, Nic!

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:31.511
Evacuate immediateIy.
Detonation in 8 minutes.

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:32.887
Shit!

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.117
Angela!

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:13.678
Shit!

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:20.685
We have to get out of here.
This place is going to blow!

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:25.440
The dining room...

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.577
They're going.

01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:49.881
Can you hear anything?

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:51.090
No.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:57.889
Evacuate immediateIy.
Detonation in 6 minutes.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:02.185
We have to get to the deck.
Time's running out.

01:23:03.771 --> 01:23:05.938
The motor? Where's the motor?

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:09.400
-It got stuck. I left it in the corridor.
-Fuck!

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:16.074
It's okay. We'll go back,
grab it and run, okay?

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:21.162
Okay, one, two, three!

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:26.918
You're not leaving without me?

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:38.346
After all we've been through...

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:50.274
No, Angela. I'm going with you.

01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.485
I still have a lot of work to do.

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:33.359
Come on! Go!

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:35.570
Detonation in 4 minutes.

01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:36.696
Come on! Run!

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.156
Run, run!

01:24:57.801 --> 01:25:18.070
Run!

01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:24.869
The motor! Give me the motor!

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:57.026
-We have to jump!
-I can't! I can't!

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:59.487
If you don't jump, we're going to die.

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:00.571
Jump!

01:26:02.616 --> 01:26:04.200
I can't! I can't!

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.037
Jump!

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:13.376
Nic!

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.465
Jump, Angela!

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:41.821
Jump, damn it! Jump!

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:44.824
You have to Jump! Jump!

01:27:12.311 --> 01:27:13.936
Angela!

01:27:56.647 --> 01:27:58.147
Nic!

01:27:58.231 --> 01:28:00.274
Here! Angela!

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:08.699
Grab my hand.

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:17.375
Take my hand, Angela.

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:45.069
Come on!

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:49.407
Shit! It won't start! It's jammed.

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:05.983
Any cars for the PIaza HoteI?

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.987
Car 5, I'll drop my passengers downtown
and head over there.

01:30:17.079 --> 01:30:18.287
Some party, eh?

01:30:19.305 --> 01:30:25.447
