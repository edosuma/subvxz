WEBVTT

00:02.710 --> 00:06.870
Neuro-intergalactic vibrations,
the invasion's coming.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.500
You know they're watching us right now.

00:10.510 --> 00:14.310
These other dimensions-
they're everywhere.

00:14.320 --> 00:20.720
And string- it's obvious- string
is the thing that connects everything,

00:20.730 --> 00:23.530
and I'm not talking about
the stuff you can see:

00:23.540 --> 00:28.530
Protons, photons, fig
newtons, electrons, neutrons

00:28.540 --> 00:32.910
and time...and space...

00:32.920 --> 00:34.170
time and space?

00:34.180 --> 00:35.800
All right.

00:35.810 --> 00:39.850
I see you, turning your back
on me, shaking your head.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.370
I can't help you.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.430
Ignore the truth at your own peril, sir.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.580
At your own peril.

00:46.590 --> 00:49.480
Hi, see, we can't see the
strings 'cause they're invisible,

00:49.500 --> 00:52.220
but they can 'cause
they're the 11th dimension.

00:52.230 --> 00:53.970
Hey, you're ready for
them tonight, evelyn.

00:53.990 --> 00:56.400
The invasion's tonight.

00:56.410 --> 00:59.180
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.320
What's the matter? Can't look?

01:01.330 --> 01:03.130
You know what that tells me?

01:03.140 --> 01:04.120
That you did it.

01:04.150 --> 01:07.580
You shot her, you put a dress on her.

01:07.590 --> 01:10.730
I mean, the trooper saw you put the
body in the back of your pickup truck.

01:10.740 --> 01:13.620
Anything else you did,
we're going to find out.

01:13.860 --> 01:16.300
That's what he's doing.

01:16.310 --> 01:20.020
And the body is in autopsy right now.

01:22.420 --> 01:25.290
Oh, this must be our jane doe.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.190
Doe, a deer.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.470
A female deer.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.900
- It's not funny.
- It's a little funny.

01:31.910 --> 01:33.590
Doc, I already took photos.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.290
Not for my scrapbook, you didn'T.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.020
This is animal abuse.

01:38.030 --> 01:40.800
The killing, sure. The dress?

01:40.810 --> 01:43.650
Pet owners put sweaters on chihuahuas.

01:43.660 --> 01:46.730
Just give me a hand with the arrow.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.350 --> 01:59.630
Hmm, it's not an arrow; it's
a bolt shot from a crossbow.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.470
alcohol.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.710
You think he had to get her liquored up?

02:05.720 --> 02:08.889
Okay, so you got a
dui, resisting arrest,

02:08.900 --> 02:13.090
several new and unique
wildlife violations.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.960
You're in a truckload of trouble, kyle.

02:15.970 --> 02:19.000
I... I... I found her like that.

02:19.010 --> 02:21.190
In a cocktail dress?

02:24.560 --> 02:26.570
I didn't put no dress on her.

02:26.580 --> 02:31.250
Oh, no, no, no... see, I was...
I was taking her to the vet.

02:31.260 --> 02:33.600
You sure it wasn't a nightclub?

02:33.610 --> 02:37.700
Then how do you explain the crossbow
I found in your truck there, boss?

02:37.710 --> 02:40.340
Easy. Somebody put it there.

02:40.350 --> 02:43.850
Okay, take a deep breath for me now.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.860
Blow into this.

02:47.420 --> 02:50.450
Come on, guys. I mean, can'T...
can't you give me a break here?

02:50.460 --> 02:54.850
I mean, look, no, here...
I... I... I just got A...

02:54.860 --> 02:59.520
I got a divorce, right, and
my ex just cleaned me out.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.180
Let me guess: Her name is bambi.

03:02.630 --> 03:04.450
Blow!

03:16.130 --> 03:17.250
stop him!

03:18.720 --> 03:20.000
You,stop

03:33.430 --> 03:36.280
- move, move, move!
- Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

03:47.010 --> 03:49.140
citizens arrest!

03:52.610 --> 03:54.600
Light him up.

04:03.180 --> 04:06.010
now do you believe me?

04:48.130 --> 04:52.410
Stun guns aren't necessarily
nonlethal, just less lethal.

04:55.870 --> 04:59.590
Afid tags confirm it was
officer choi's weapon.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.450
You know, i don't get it.

05:02.460 --> 05:06.200
Suspect makes a break for
it, clocks a couple of unis,

05:06.210 --> 05:09.370
gets pepper-sprayed, and keeps going.

05:09.380 --> 05:12.020
Pepper spray doesn't always stop
them when they're really drunk.

05:12.030 --> 05:14.210
Suspect blew a.28

05:14.220 --> 05:16.770
Oh, well, maybe he was a sloppy drunk.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.080
Any alcohol on his clothes?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.300
He'd been in pd for hours.

05:19.310 --> 05:21.010
Alcohol would have evaporated.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.650
Stokes: I'm gonna need your stun gun.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.270
Am I in trouble?

05:24.280 --> 05:26.450
When was the last time you
had this thing serviced?

05:26.460 --> 05:27.790
Not since I've been on the force.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.020
That's only six months now.

05:29.030 --> 05:31.950
We'll have it analyzed, see
if it was malfunctioning.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.410
That's the first time I had to shoot it.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.030
Relax, man.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.650
You were following captain's orders.

05:37.660 --> 05:40.660
When you talk to ia, just be
honest... and don't expect a hug.

05:40.670 --> 05:44.140
That's when you said to your
officer, I quote, "light him up."

05:44.150 --> 05:45.660
Poor choice of words.

05:45.670 --> 05:48.040
We followed the proper procedure
for escalation of force.

05:48.050 --> 05:49.200
I mean, at least we didn't shoot him.

05:49.220 --> 05:50.730
Of course, that would have killed him.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.730
As far as my office is concerned, we
got an in-custody death on your orders.

05:54.740 --> 05:55.800
Doesn't get much worse.

05:55.810 --> 05:57.860
Look, we use stun guns
all the time around here;

05:57.870 --> 06:00.310
this is the first one
that caught on fire.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.300
What do you think? Maybe this guy had
so much booze it made him a roman candle?

06:03.310 --> 06:06.640
Well, unfortunelaty,
human blood is 83% water.

06:06.650 --> 06:09.460
It's just not flammable,
no matter how drunk you are.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.880
That's too bad. Might
have let you off the hook.

06:17.530 --> 06:20.190
Together in death, as they were in life.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.870
Guy abuses wildlife and
then bursts into flames.

06:23.890 --> 06:26.310
I call it karma.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.550
There are no physical signs their
relationship was anything other than platonic.

06:30.560 --> 06:35.300
I mean, we're the ones encroaching on their
habitat- you don't see them shooting us.

06:37.250 --> 06:40.440
Consider this justice
for bambi's mother.

06:53.230 --> 06:55.590
1 Charge:49.6KV System Operation:Normal

06:57.250 --> 06:58.570
Light him up.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.520
This is the rest of the stuff that
we got from the dead guy's truck.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.670
One crossbow.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.160
Same bolts we recovered
from the dead deer.

07:20.850 --> 07:23.380
Couple of mason jars.

07:26.190 --> 07:29.670
Moonshine. Home brew. Firewater.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.400
Grain alcohol's 190 proof, you know?

07:32.410 --> 07:34.180
That's 95% alcohol.

07:34.190 --> 07:35.560
Who was he trying to forget?

07:35.570 --> 07:38.220
Well, brass said that
he'd just gotten divorced.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.910
Welcome to the club.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.270
You see any night-vision goggles
or, uh, spotlights in that box?

07:44.280 --> 07:46.060
No, why?

07:46.070 --> 07:50.010
Well... I think he must have
shot the deer during the day

07:50.020 --> 07:52.560
and then waited until dark
to put her in his truck.

07:52.570 --> 07:56.050
That's a long time just sitting
out in the woods drinking.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.620
Stun gun checks out.

07:57.630 --> 07:59.020
Operates as designed.

07:59.030 --> 08:01.780
Puts out the standard 50,000 volts.

08:01.790 --> 08:04.040
Well, that eliminates one variable.

08:04.050 --> 08:08.960
Leaves us with the shirt, the
grain alcohol, and the pepper spray.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.200
Time to find out if one of
those made him catch on fire.

08:14.630 --> 08:17.430
Don't tase me, bro.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.800
Don't tempt me.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.910
What are we missing?

09:03.840 --> 09:05.340
Johnson: Either she's a 421-adam,

09:05.350 --> 09:08.670
or somewhere a scarecrow and a
lion are looking for their friend.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.580
Stokes: That's evelyn. She's
wearing her deflector suit.

09:11.590 --> 09:16.550
Every night, she comes down to pd at some
point, and she files a complaint against them.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.680
What did them do to her?

09:18.690 --> 09:21.990
Everything, from stealing
her thoughts to raping her,

09:22.460 --> 09:25.950
but even if she is crazy,
she's a variable in all this.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.660
See, there may have been some sort of
transfer between her and burning man.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.110
She didn't stick around for the debrief.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.320
Well, can you blame her?

09:34.330 --> 09:37.610
She just witnessed
spontaneous alien combustion.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.070
- And you didn't hold her.
- No.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.320
Did you get a statement?

09:43.820 --> 09:46.980
- Where is she now?
- We don't know.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.020
There's a lot you don't know.

09:49.030 --> 09:52.070
You can count on three things
happening every day around here.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.550
The coffee machine's
going to break down;

09:54.560 --> 09:58.320
some tourist is going to
swear the hooker was over 18;

09:58.330 --> 10:00.870
and evelyn's going to show up.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.090
We got a broadcast out. We'll find her.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.380
She's very shiny.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.720
It's gotta be getting
hot under all that foil.

10:19.730 --> 10:22.740
She's going to cook out here fast.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.260
evelyn.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.370
What happened?

10:32.380 --> 10:34.630
The driver... said his shift was over.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.320
He was just taking the
truck back to the yard.

10:37.330 --> 10:40.940
Said a flash of light
came out of nowhere.

10:45.450 --> 10:47.940
the sun was just coming up.

10:47.950 --> 10:51.200
Reflection off of her
suit must have blinded him.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.280
Okay, well, this tin foil's
evidence in two cases now,

10:54.290 --> 10:56.560
so we've got to be careful with it.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.020
Butane lighter.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.660
It's cracked. Looks empty.

11:05.670 --> 11:08.410
That could be what lit the
flame in your deer hunter.

11:08.420 --> 11:10.000
I'll check the foil for butane.

11:10.010 --> 11:13.080
Trouble is, it's probably
evaporated by now.

11:13.790 --> 11:15.160
200 bucks.

11:15.170 --> 11:18.140
- Okay, turn her over, dave.
- Sure.

11:22.730 --> 11:25.460
Guys. We got some green fluid here.

11:25.470 --> 11:28.490
- It's coming from the wound.
- Damn!

11:29.180 --> 11:31.010
I think that's blood.

11:55.962 --> 11:58.592
Take a look. You're
not going to believe it.

12:01.152 --> 12:03.822
Another 419 with green blood.

12:03.832 --> 12:05.952
What are the odds?

12:07.202 --> 12:10.732
That he's not connected to
our first victim? Astronomical.

12:11.812 --> 12:14.212
Looks like blunt-force trauma to me.

12:15.552 --> 12:18.372
Grissom: You know, tin foil lady was
run over just a few blocks from here.

12:18.382 --> 12:21.242
I bet this area was
home to both of them.

12:38.412 --> 12:40.802
three pairs of sunglasses?

12:50.072 --> 12:51.942
Earplugs.

12:52.282 --> 12:56.642
That, david, is how you make it dark
and quiet when you sleep on the street.

13:07.472 --> 13:09.742
I think I found the weapon!

13:11.212 --> 13:14.402
We should betoble a get
some good prints off it.

13:29.972 --> 13:34.712
I've seen green blood before, but only
from bodies in advanced stages of decomp.

13:36.892 --> 13:38.692
What do you think turned it green?

13:38.702 --> 13:40.922
I suspect it might be sulfur.

13:40.932 --> 13:43.702
Hmm, sulfur's a naturally
occurring component of blood.

13:43.712 --> 13:49.222
Yes, but in massive doses it tends to
turn the blood a blackish avocado green.

13:49.232 --> 13:54.692
When the sulfur atom joins the hemoglobin
molecules, red blood turns green.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.972
Which is why first officer spock's
blood is green in star trek.

13:58.982 --> 14:00.012
No, it's not.

14:00.022 --> 14:03.512
Uh, yes, it is. Trust me. I'm an expert.

14:03.522 --> 14:06.412
Well, apparently not, because
otherwise you would surely know

14:06.422 --> 14:08.582
that the oxidizing agent
in vulcan blood is copper.

14:08.592 --> 14:11.272
And that is why his blood is green.

14:12.022 --> 14:13.862
Well, it was that and the fact
that he had a vulcan father,

14:13.872 --> 14:16.922
since his mother was actually human.

14:17.612 --> 14:22.212
And furthermore, he was promoted to
captain just prior to star trek ii

14:22.222 --> 14:25.792
and then he retired
as civilian ambassador.

14:26.202 --> 14:29.852
You're like a geeky, nerdy
guy trapped in a woman's body.

14:29.862 --> 14:31.952
So are you.

14:35.592 --> 14:39.672
Well, as I was saying, here on earth,

14:39.682 --> 14:44.542
sulfur-containing compounds could
turn otherwise normal blood green.

14:51.112 --> 14:53.532
- As I suspected.
- What?

14:53.872 --> 14:55.512
Share.

14:57.192 --> 14:59.492
She wasn't a vulcan.

15:00.982 --> 15:02.782
Thank you.

15:07.722 --> 15:11.382
I don't want to take all the credit, but I do
know why both your victims have green blood.

15:11.392 --> 15:13.322
High levels of sulfur.

15:13.332 --> 15:15.022
Yes.

15:16.642 --> 15:18.242
Did you identify the source yet?

15:18.252 --> 15:23.072
Not yet. I'll get the blood over to henry and
have him run a tox panel for sulfuric compounds.

15:23.082 --> 15:27.092
Oh, and even if your tin
foil lady was gushing blood,

15:27.102 --> 15:29.612
it would not have contributed to
your stun gun guy's immolation.

15:29.622 --> 15:30.972
Did you find anything on the foil?

15:30.982 --> 15:33.462
Bacon grease and trace
amounts of ketchup.

15:33.472 --> 15:37.642
Both things you would find at a barbeque,
but not the kind that you're dealing with.

15:38.662 --> 15:39.562
brass just called.

15:39.572 --> 15:43.252
Our lonely deer hunter's
parents just hired a lawyer.

15:43.262 --> 15:44.492
The department's going to be sued.

15:44.502 --> 15:46.812
We haven't even released
the case details yet.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.822
Our investigation's still ongoing.

15:48.832 --> 15:51.542
Well, they got something we don't.

15:51.552 --> 15:55.452
Move! Move! Move! Get away! Get away!

15:56.372 --> 15:59.092
over 60,000 hits since it was posted.

16:00.492 --> 16:06.022
Stokes: Here, on the pd surveillance,
this ambulance chaser on his cell phone-

16:06.032 --> 16:07.322
he's a regular.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.982
Want to bet he's the one
that shot the footage?

16:09.992 --> 16:11.972
Want to bet he's the one filing suit?

16:11.982 --> 16:15.892
Well, his cell phone has a better
angle than the pd surveillance camera.

16:15.902 --> 16:19.202
Archie, run this back
to where he gets sprayed.

16:21.802 --> 16:24.942
Wait a minute. Tighten up on the can.

16:26.762 --> 16:29.882
Nick, when we did the
experiment with jell-o man,

16:29.892 --> 16:33.522
we used pepper spray
from a red can, right?

16:33.532 --> 16:36.572
Yeah. Yeah, department-issue.
Got it through logistics.

16:36.582 --> 16:38.952
That one's yellow.

16:42.312 --> 16:44.442
I've used my pepper spray half
a dozen times on the street.

16:44.452 --> 16:46.792
All I had to do was
write a use-of-force memo.

16:46.802 --> 16:50.702
Brass: Speaking of memos, didn't you get
the one we issued about five years ago?

16:51.642 --> 16:52.292
I know what you mean.

16:52.302 --> 16:56.192
Yeah, you know, when the department
switched over to water-based pepper spray.

16:56.202 --> 16:58.382
Stokes: This one uses isobutane.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.792
Compressed gas, highly flammable stuff.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.552
Where's yours?

17:02.562 --> 17:03.572
It's murphy's law, right?

17:03.582 --> 17:07.842
I always got my gear together, wired tight,
but last night my girl takes my pepper spray.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.002
And I don't blame her because
she's got a dangerous job.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.762
Oh, yeah? What does she do?

17:11.771 --> 17:13.442
She goes to wlvu during the day.

17:13.452 --> 17:18.092
She studies kinesiology, but she
dances nights at the acid strip.

17:18.942 --> 17:21.732
what does she clip the
can to, her g-string?

17:21.742 --> 17:24.402
It'd be a deterrent to stuffing
a tip in there, wouldn't it?

17:24.412 --> 17:28.182
Come on; she walks to the
parking lot alone at 4:00 A.M.

17:28.192 --> 17:30.852
Okay, so she takes your
department-issue, so what'd you do?

17:30.862 --> 17:32.452
Pick up an old can lying around?

17:32.462 --> 17:35.032
No, bought one at catalani's
gun world on the way in.

17:35.042 --> 17:38.532
I didn't get a chance to change
it out. Does it really matter?

17:38.922 --> 17:40.822
It might.

18:29.964 --> 18:30.974
hey, greg.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.144
I just ran your pipe over to
prints after I sampled it for blood.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.774
- Yeah, did you find something wrong?
- I found something weird.

18:36.784 --> 18:39.504
One end of the pipe was covered
with blood from the victim.

18:39.514 --> 18:42.824
Yeah, the administrator at the shelter
id'd him as wayne connor, homeless.

18:42.834 --> 18:44.004
Well, then on the other end of the pipe,

18:44.014 --> 18:46.784
I found several small blood
smears from an unknown donor.

18:46.794 --> 18:49.224
So the killer was also injured.

18:49.234 --> 18:51.804
His blood's green, too.

18:52.534 --> 18:57.994
"Once is happenstance. Twice is
coincidence. Three times is enemy action."

18:58.004 --> 18:59.484
Hodges: Winston churchill?

18:59.494 --> 19:01.154
Ian fleming.

19:01.164 --> 19:03.744
I should know that. I'm
a huge james bond fan.

19:03.754 --> 19:05.714
What aren't you a fan of?

19:05.724 --> 19:08.864
I ran the green bloods for
sulfur-containing compounds.

19:08.874 --> 19:10.334
Still working on the third donor,

19:10.344 --> 19:15.794
but evelyn polychronopolous and wayne connor th
hboad high levels of thiocyte in their systems.

19:15.804 --> 19:18.574
Prescription medication for migraines.

19:18.584 --> 19:21.334
Andrews: I checked with the downtown
wnharmacies. They don't dispense it.

19:21.344 --> 19:25.804
154 nanograms per milliliter-
that's overdose levels.

19:25.814 --> 19:28.474
Even if they were in a clinical
trial, they wouldn't get that much.

19:28.484 --> 19:30.084
It's not a typical drug of abuse.

19:30.094 --> 19:32.614
Grissom: Yeah, but if you've got a migraine,
you'll do anything to stop the pain.

19:32.624 --> 19:34.274
How do you know they had migraines?

19:34.284 --> 19:39.534
Well, aside from the medication, connor was
wearing three pairs of sunglasses and earplugs.

19:39.544 --> 19:42.534
Photo and phonosensitivity
are symptoms of migraines.

19:42.544 --> 19:46.204
Maybe that's why evelyn thought
"they" were invading her brain.

19:46.214 --> 19:50.714
She was killed only a few blocks from the
vacant lot with a couple hundred dollars on her.

19:50.734 --> 19:52.254
She could have been on
her way to a drug buy.

19:52.264 --> 19:57.134
So if we can figure out who's selling the
drugs, it may lead us to who killed connor.

20:05.424 --> 20:07.194
damn busy day.

20:07.204 --> 20:09.734
- where are they?
- Inside, end of the hall.

20:09.744 --> 20:11.704
Mailman got worried when
they didn't come to the door.

20:11.714 --> 20:14.774
We did a welfare check,
found them both in the bed.

20:14.784 --> 20:17.234
- Doc.
- Catherine.

20:17.564 --> 20:22.314
No forced entry; no sign of
trauma; bodies don't look posed.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.094
No gas odor, no petechiae.

20:25.104 --> 20:26.884
No sign of suffocation.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.674
So why'd you call csi?

20:28.684 --> 20:30.354
Couple in their late 60s.

20:30.374 --> 20:34.214
What are the chances they died of
natural causes at the same time?

20:41.714 --> 20:44.434
"Digoxin.

20:44.444 --> 20:48.034
"Warfarin. Amiodarone."

20:48.044 --> 20:50.964
Those are all heart medications.

20:53.464 --> 20:55.774
"Zolpidem." That's for sleep.

20:55.784 --> 20:57.804
I know. Bottle's almost full.

20:57.814 --> 21:00.574
No foaming at the mouth,
no note left behind.

21:00.584 --> 21:03.424
I don't think this is a double suicide.

21:05.234 --> 21:08.854
Suspicious circs. Good call.

21:09.484 --> 21:12.014
They look like they loved each other.

21:17.934 --> 21:21.964
catherine: Looks like caddyshack back
here. Invasion of the ground squirrels.

21:21.974 --> 21:24.314
yeah, I got a few casualties out here.

21:24.324 --> 21:28.324
I see. What the hell is that?

21:28.334 --> 21:31.174
Looks like a close encounter, right?

21:36.164 --> 21:40.234
"Atomic dave's painless removals."

21:41.034 --> 21:43.534
Some kind of pest control gizmo.

21:43.544 --> 21:45.084
Apparently, it works.

21:45.094 --> 21:49.004
I don't think the squirrels would
agree that it's painless, though.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.324
Shr dinger martin?

21:58.514 --> 22:00.854
he had a cat named shr dinger.

22:00.864 --> 22:02.784
Must have been into physics.

22:02.794 --> 22:04.594
Cat grave.

22:05.014 --> 22:08.704
dead cat, dead critters, dead couple.

22:21.804 --> 22:24.814
imagine living next door to that racket.

22:36.394 --> 22:38.324
Woman: Last night?

22:38.334 --> 22:41.484
I was in my studio. I'm an artist.

22:43.174 --> 22:45.974
Didn't your neighbors
complain about the noise?

22:45.984 --> 22:48.304
I don't weld at night.

22:48.314 --> 22:50.314
I work on my jewelry.

22:50.324 --> 22:53.094
- High-end stuff.
- Nice.

22:53.684 --> 22:56.354
Listen, how well did you know
your neighbors, the martins?

22:56.364 --> 22:57.634
Are they dead?

22:57.654 --> 22:59.824
Yeah. They passed away last night.

22:59.834 --> 23:01.784
Hardly knew them.

23:01.794 --> 23:04.804
Heard he was a, uh...
Professor or something.

23:04.814 --> 23:06.844
Yeah, we really didn't
have too much in common.

23:06.854 --> 23:11.294
Well, apparently, you both
shared a ground squirrel problem.

23:11.634 --> 23:13.534
could be worse, I guess.

23:13.544 --> 23:16.314
I could still be with my deadbeat ex.

23:16.324 --> 23:19.204
There's a pest I did get rid of.

23:19.574 --> 23:21.404
Robbins: Hey, catherine.

23:21.974 --> 23:25.744
What a relief. Two
red-blooded americans.

23:26.234 --> 23:31.174
According to his stomach contents, he
likes a glass of red wine with his pasta.

23:32.234 --> 23:35.664
Looks like suppertime was
about four hours premortem.

23:35.674 --> 23:38.634
Take a look at the light board.

23:39.824 --> 23:42.104
Both martins wore pacemakers.

23:42.114 --> 23:45.524
Mrs. Martin's is in that bowl.

23:49.044 --> 23:51.594
takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

23:51.604 --> 23:54.924
Yeah, I hope mine's still
working when I pop off.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.074
You wear a pacemaker?

23:56.084 --> 23:59.284
Bradycardia-
slow heart.

23:59.294 --> 24:02.904
Every once in a while, just to
make sure I don't skip a beat,

24:02.914 --> 24:07.314
the pacer kicks in, just like this one.

24:07.324 --> 24:11.284
Well, obviously, they didn't
die of pacer malfunction.

24:14.894 --> 24:16.864
what you got?

24:16.874 --> 24:17.874
Check this out.

24:17.884 --> 24:20.994
It's like having a witness
to his death inside his body.

24:21.004 --> 24:24.084
There's no interruption in
his pacemaker functions, but...

24:24.094 --> 24:28.974
about eight hours before he died,
there was a spike in his heart rate.

24:28.984 --> 24:32.984
His wife's is almost identical, so
something got their hearts racing.

24:33.004 --> 24:36.294
Who knows? Maybe they, uh,
enjoyed a little afternoon delight.

24:36.304 --> 24:38.064
Well, let's hope.

24:38.074 --> 24:41.064
either way, their heartbeats
went back to normal

24:41.074 --> 24:44.774
and they died in their
sleep a few hours later.

25:22.094 --> 25:23.784
MODIFY SEARCH PARAMETERS Limit or
Include Criteria in Search:MILITARY

25:35.104 --> 25:39.314
okay, so I've been thinking
this over and here's my advice.

25:40.054 --> 25:41.634
If you want to get a real
relationship with a girl,

25:41.654 --> 25:44.304
you are going to have
to move out of mom's.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.494
No girl wants the
competition. I'm sorry.

26:07.154 --> 26:09.764
oh, god, no, no, turn 'em off.
Turn 'em off. Turn 'em off.

26:09.774 --> 26:13.034
David bohr, you're under arrest
for the murder of wayne connor.

26:13.044 --> 26:15.214
No, no, it was self-defense.

26:15.224 --> 26:17.654
He tried to kill me over
a couple hundred bucks.

26:17.664 --> 26:19.654
He needed some stuff.

26:19.664 --> 26:22.484
He couldn't pay. He said
some money was coming.

26:22.494 --> 26:23.974
I had to go to work.

26:23.994 --> 26:27.264
I turned to leave and he
comes at me like an animal.

26:36.534 --> 26:38.694
Control,this is captain brass.

26:38.704 --> 26:42.294
We need a code 3 paramedic
response to my location.

26:42.304 --> 26:43.674
No!

28:07.388 --> 28:09.448
Hey, I got your page. What's up?

28:09.458 --> 28:12.028
I think our cases might be connected.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.028
Take a look at that.

28:16.778 --> 28:20.228
So my green-blooded
victim from the vacant lot

28:20.238 --> 28:24.908
was buying pharmaceuticals from the guy
who did pest removal for your dead couple.

28:26.278 --> 28:29.718
Looks like this guy was trying to
create radio frequencies or something.

28:29.728 --> 28:33.488
Well, I don't know what kind of
effect that has on household pests,

28:33.498 --> 28:36.148
but radio waves can produce
"noise on the channel,"

28:36.158 --> 28:38.648
which could interfere
with pacemaker function.

28:38.658 --> 28:42.108
Thing is... the martins'
pacemakers are still ticking.

28:44.178 --> 28:46.728
Ah, the luck of the irish.

28:46.738 --> 28:48.178
It makes sense, though.

28:48.188 --> 28:50.518
If his blood was green,
his organs would be green.

28:50.528 --> 28:52.938
Well, frankly, I expected
something more in the...

28:52.958 --> 28:55.958
dark avocado, almost black range.

28:55.968 --> 28:58.398
Yeah, this is more artichoke.

28:58.408 --> 29:01.138
you know, atmospheric sulfur
levels are on the rise.

29:01.148 --> 29:04.148
Hundred years, we're all
going to look like spinach.

29:04.348 --> 29:05.558
you guys didn't wait for me.

29:05.568 --> 29:07.598
We're just about to excise his brain.

29:07.608 --> 29:11.998
I'll bet you five bucks, greg, that
his brain is not as green as his heart.

29:12.008 --> 29:14.118
Keep your money in your pockets, greg.

29:14.128 --> 29:17.008
There's a higher vascular
nature to the heart and lungs.

29:17.018 --> 29:19.748
Only the blood vessels in the
brain are going to be green.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.908
It's a sucker bet and you know it.

29:21.918 --> 29:23.558
Well, thanks, doc.

29:23.568 --> 29:29.728
So, uh, dave here did some humane rodent
pest removal for desert palm hospital,

29:29.738 --> 29:32.298
which is where he got
his hands on the thiocyte.

29:32.318 --> 29:35.528
He was all about freedom from pain.

29:43.598 --> 29:46.528
- Sea foam.
- A lovely shade.

30:00.908 --> 30:02.648
Look at the size of that.

30:02.658 --> 30:06.528
He had a brain tumor
pressing on the amygdala.

30:08.418 --> 30:10.488
Well, this could cause his migraines.

30:10.498 --> 30:15.548
Absolutely, and also aggressive
disruptive behavior, paranoia.

30:15.558 --> 30:18.088
As the tumor enlarged,
it impacted the arteries,

30:18.098 --> 30:21.308
causing the cerebral
hemorrhage that you observed.

30:22.268 --> 30:24.738
he was self-medicating
for the wrong condition.

30:24.748 --> 30:26.798
No wonder he overdosed.

30:29.048 --> 30:30.718
Willows: Let 'er rip.

30:34.368 --> 30:36.938
in order to interfere
with pacemaker function,

30:36.948 --> 30:40.518
it'd have to be putting
out between 50 and 60 hertz.

30:40.528 --> 30:43.948
Okay, I'll input that range.

30:49.968 --> 30:52.918
this thing isn't putting
out anything that's lethal.

30:52.928 --> 30:55.978
Tox report showed that the
medications weren't lethal.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.008
This thing's harmless.

30:57.018 --> 30:58.738
I refuse to believe
it was natural causes.

30:58.748 --> 31:01.088
It's too big of a coincidence.

31:01.098 --> 31:05.028
So we've got a dead
cat and dead squirrels.

31:05.038 --> 31:08.948
Maybe what killed them is
what killed the martins.

31:21.368 --> 31:23.948
In an interview in the
san francisco chronicle-

31:23.958 --> 31:27.978
october 31, 1996, if
I recall correctly-

31:27.988 --> 31:30.918
one professor gilbert grissom
revealed that as a boy,

31:30.938 --> 31:36.568
he collected dead animals he found in his marina delrey
neighborhood and performed necropsies on them.

31:37.728 --> 31:39.878
Hodges...

31:39.888 --> 31:43.018
I want you to stop stalking me.

31:49.688 --> 31:52.248
bitter almonds.

32:02.458 --> 32:05.698
Cyanide crystals in the stomach lining.

32:05.708 --> 32:10.708
Yeah, any time you need a sniffer to
detect it, my nose has the cyanide gene.

32:11.828 --> 32:14.698
What gene turned your nose brown?

32:15.578 --> 32:17.558
Go ahead. You can sew him up.

32:17.568 --> 32:21.468
Will do. And I'll
notify next of kin, too.

32:24.718 --> 32:26.018
Cyanide is fast-acting.

32:26.028 --> 32:30.118
If it killed the squirrels before the crystals
were dissolved completely in their stomachs,

32:30.148 --> 32:32.058
you'd expect the same
thing with the martins.

32:32.068 --> 32:33.698
I saw the martins' stomach contents.

32:33.708 --> 32:35.088
There were no white crystals.

32:35.098 --> 32:37.808
Yeah, but maybe if it was
ingested in a different manner.

32:37.828 --> 32:40.388
Squirrels will eat anything.If
the martins drank it,

32:40.398 --> 32:42.528
then that would explain
the absence of crystals.

32:42.538 --> 32:46.128
I already have henry running
an expanded tox panel.

32:46.818 --> 32:49.188
Any minute now.

32:50.388 --> 32:52.688
It's cooking.

32:53.688 --> 32:56.728
it's coming right up. Yeah.

32:57.778 --> 32:59.828
You hear hodges is looking
for his own apartment?

32:59.838 --> 33:01.288
Cut the old apron strings.

33:01.298 --> 33:05.358
His mother finally kicked
him out, huh? Good for her.

33:09.528 --> 33:11.608
Lethal levels of cyanide.

33:11.628 --> 33:14.258
You can't just walk into a
hardware store and pick some up.

33:14.268 --> 33:16.488
What about pest control
companies? Can they get it?

33:16.498 --> 33:22.348
Yeah. And mining companies, uh,
electroplaters, photographers, jewelry makers.

33:22.798 --> 33:26.458
Thanks, henry. You can relax now.

33:33.548 --> 33:36.698
- look, is this going to take long?
- Depends on you.

33:37.408 --> 33:40.278
'Cause I'm dealing with
some really bad news.

33:40.668 --> 33:43.688
I just found out my ex died last night.

33:43.998 --> 33:45.758
I'm sorry.

33:45.788 --> 33:48.698
Yeah, apparently one of you
guys blew him up with a stun gun.

33:48.708 --> 33:51.408
Kyle planck is your ex?

33:51.418 --> 33:55.748
Tell me, what is it that you two have
against god's fur-covered creatures?

33:55.758 --> 33:57.218
Is this about that damn cat?

33:57.228 --> 33:59.488
For starters, yes.

34:01.528 --> 34:03.558
Look, I like cats, all right?

34:03.568 --> 34:05.998
It was an accident.

34:06.008 --> 34:09.358
You can't just relocate
ground squirrels. Okay?

34:09.368 --> 34:11.648
I mean, they're... they're disgusting.

34:11.658 --> 34:15.598
And I'm an artist. I need a
certain environment to work in.

34:15.608 --> 34:18.998
Does this environment
give you access to cyanide?

34:19.007 --> 34:22.277
I use potassium cyanide
in electroplating.

34:22.288 --> 34:23.808
All my work is custom.

34:23.818 --> 34:26.487
And also to poison ground squirrels?

34:26.498 --> 34:29.447
I mixed a little with a can of tuna.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.967
And I put it out back.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.038
But only in my yard.

34:34.047 --> 34:35.918
All right, who knew the martins'
cat was going to find it?

34:35.947 --> 34:37.058
What? Is that against the law?

34:37.068 --> 34:40.398
Actually, irresponsible use
of poison is against the law,

34:40.408 --> 34:44.848
as well as killing ground
squirrels and killing neighbors.

34:44.858 --> 34:46.678
What?

34:46.967 --> 34:49.898
I didn't... I didn't kill them.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.818
Look, we had neighbor issues.

34:54.277 --> 34:56.678
Turn that damn thing
off before I torch it!

34:56.688 --> 34:58.298
You're driving all your
squirrels into my yard.

34:58.308 --> 35:01.308
All right, look, we're just
trying to be humane here.

35:01.318 --> 35:02.808
Now you use poison.

35:02.818 --> 35:04.838
And you-you killed shr dinger.

35:04.858 --> 35:06.928
You should've kept your cat on
your side of the fence, all right.

35:06.938 --> 35:10.118
- You're causing this problem, not me.
- Just leave us alone!

35:11.548 --> 35:14.268
I killed the squirrels.

35:14.668 --> 35:17.338
And possibly their cat.

35:17.348 --> 35:20.418
But I am not a murderer.

35:38.848 --> 35:40.778
I got nothing.

35:40.788 --> 35:43.048
Try the bed.

35:53.168 --> 35:54.958
That's...

35:54.968 --> 36:00.418
sorry. I was thinking of one of those,
uh, bloodhounds in the old cartoons,

36:00.428 --> 36:04.428
"sniffing awound to find da wabbit."

36:05.418 --> 36:07.358
this is a gift.

36:07.368 --> 36:09.858
Don't make it cheap.

36:15.108 --> 36:16.468
trail's gone cold.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.748
So, they died in this room.

36:19.758 --> 36:22.038
In bed.

36:27.978 --> 36:30.558
Give me a hand with the mattress.

36:46.148 --> 36:50.228
Now, get down and sniff the rug.

36:51.428 --> 36:53.918
It's all they ever want.

37:02.978 --> 37:05.028
pay dirt.

37:10.648 --> 37:14.158
- This carpet looks kind of new, right?
- Yeah.

37:28.788 --> 37:32.308
Definitely some combustion there.

37:37.058 --> 37:39.828
It looks like they just laid the
new carpet right on top of the old,

37:39.838 --> 37:42.658
which clearly limited
the supply of oxygen.

37:42.668 --> 37:47.058
The old carpet melted
without bursting into flame.

37:50.378 --> 37:55.968
Ironically, older carpets contained
polyvinyl chloride used as a flame retardant.

37:55.978 --> 38:01.928
So, when it got hot, it probably
went into quantitative decomposition,

38:02.408 --> 38:08.378
which gave off gases,
including hydrogen cyanide.

38:21.228 --> 38:23.598
field work dirty.

38:23.608 --> 38:26.408
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

38:29.498 --> 38:31.818
You're, Hodges.

38:53.768 --> 38:55.968
Come on!

39:01.788 --> 39:03.808
Your killer's a ground squirrel?

39:03.818 --> 39:07.068
In a way, I'd argue self-defense.

39:32.458 --> 39:34.408
it was an old house.
The wood had desiccated.

39:34.418 --> 39:38.318
The short circuit smoldered
into the floor joists.

39:56.448 --> 40:00.058
is it bad when you start thinking
none of this sounds too weird anymore?

40:00.068 --> 40:02.478
Oh, it's a bit too freaky
how these cases are connected.

40:02.488 --> 40:05.548
Grissom, you always say that
there's no such thing as coincidence.

40:05.558 --> 40:06.398
There isn't.

40:06.408 --> 40:07.598
Willows: Oh, come on.

40:07.608 --> 40:11.218
You got the guy that burst into
flames just divorced from the woman

40:11.228 --> 40:14.308
who was fighting squirrel
wars with the martins.

40:14.318 --> 40:18.348
Sanders: Who had hired the exterminator whose
drugs were turning everybody's blood green.

40:18.358 --> 40:22.398
Stokes: And one of his green-blooded
customers was evelyn, our lady of tin foil,

40:22.408 --> 40:25.828
the last person that kyle
planck touched before he died.

40:25.838 --> 40:27.288
There's one more connection.

40:27.308 --> 40:28.958
Evelyn had 200 bucks.

40:28.968 --> 40:33.678
I'm thinking that when she was run over,
she was on her way to buy more thiocyte.

40:33.688 --> 40:39.058
I think that wayne connor was with david
bohr, waiting for the money to arrive.

40:39.068 --> 40:40.878
Sanders: Only evelyn never showed up.

40:40.888 --> 40:43.728
Connor lost his temper, and
bohr killed him in a fight.

40:43.738 --> 40:48.208
And it all started wie kylthplanck-
lonely guy with a gut full of moonshine.

40:48.218 --> 40:50.968
String theory.

40:51.398 --> 40:53.818
Grissom theory. This is
better than a bedtime story.

40:53.828 --> 40:56.808
Grissom: String theory is
"the theory of everything."

40:56.818 --> 41:00.328
Quantum mechanics tells
us about the very small.

41:00.338 --> 41:03.058
The theory of relativity
explains the immense.

41:03.078 --> 41:05.138
String theory ties it all together.

41:05.158 --> 41:07.668
It proposes that atomic particles

41:07.678 --> 41:11.768
are made up of infinitesimal,vibrating
loops of energy-

41:11.778 --> 41:13.188
or strings.

41:13.198 --> 41:16.228
Each string vibrates
at its own frequency-

41:16.238 --> 41:19.668
like on a violin, producing "notes."

41:19.678 --> 41:23.068
And these notes make up
everything in the universe.

41:23.078 --> 41:24.998
Cosmic symphony.

41:25.008 --> 41:30.188
These strings have been combining and
recombining ever since the big bang.

41:30.928 --> 41:35.768
So, the connections between
our victims- or any of us-

41:35.778 --> 41:38.008
are not that extraordinary.

41:38.018 --> 41:41.038
But every one of them
thought they were alone.

41:41.048 --> 41:43.488
Brown: Too bad they didn't
know about grissom's theory.

41:43.498 --> 41:47.228
In a parallel universe, maybe
they're all having breakfast together.

41:47.248 --> 41:49.418
In this universe, maybe we are.

41:49.428 --> 41:50.698
Yeah.

41:51.038 --> 41:53.038
And you're buying.

41:53.478 --> 41:55.258
No strings attached.
