00:22.822 --> 00:24.653
Temporal incursion is complete.

00:27.193 --> 00:30.219
All organisms and manmade
objects have been eradicated.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.628
Probe the continuum.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.465
Has our target event
been achieved?

00:39.839 --> 00:41.136
Negative.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.402
Negative target event.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.501
l don't understand, sir.

00:45.578 --> 00:48.274
We spent months making
these calculations.

00:50.183 --> 00:52.014
Time is patient...

00:52.085 --> 00:54.952
so we must be patient with it.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.857
Eradicating a single Zahl colony

00:58.925 --> 01:01.416
wasn't enough
for a total restoration.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.687
We have to work
on a larger scale.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.825
Take us to the Zahl homeworld.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.029
Prepare a new set
of calculations.

01:11.104 --> 01:14.870
We must erase
the entire species from time,

01:14.941 --> 01:17.273
every life- form...

01:17.343 --> 01:18.776
every molecule.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.224
Space, the great unknown.

03:14.294 --> 03:17.695
Only now we're going
to know it a little better.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.095
Harry?

03:22.101 --> 03:23.932
Before there were maps
and globes,

03:24.037 --> 03:26.403
let alone radar
and subspace sensors,

03:26.472 --> 03:29.066
mariners navigated by the stars.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.167
We're returning
to that tried- and- true method,

03:31.244 --> 03:32.973
but this time,
there's a difference.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.708
Ensign Kim and Seven of Nine

03:35.782 --> 03:38.216
have merged Starfleet
and Borg ingenuity

03:38.284 --> 03:40.184
to create this new technology,

03:40.253 --> 03:43.188
and l'm sure l speak
for the entire crew

03:43.256 --> 03:45.656
when l say...thank you.

03:48.261 --> 03:51.162
Now, how the hell does it work?

03:52.565 --> 03:54.465
Astrometric sensors
measure the radiative flux

03:54.534 --> 03:56.798
of up to three billion stars
simultaneously.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.803
The computer
then calculates our position

03:58.871 --> 04:00.498
relative to the center
of the galaxy.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.906
This mapping technology
is ten times more accurate

04:03.977 --> 04:05.444
than what we've been using.

04:05.511 --> 04:07.775
Seven, will you do the honors?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.815
We've plotted a new course home.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.079
By my estimates,

04:14.153 --> 04:17.144
this trajectory will eliminate
five years from your journey.

04:17.223 --> 04:18.713
Our journey.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.452
Nice work, Seven.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.757
That region of space
we're about to enter--

04:23.830 --> 04:25.923
it looks like it has
a lot of M- Class planets.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.626
lt does.

04:27.700 --> 04:32.535
Spatial grid 005--
primary species: the Zahl.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.573
What do we know
about this species?

04:34.641 --> 04:37.337
Technologically advanced
but nonconfrontational.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.776
Their resistance quotient
is quite low.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.177
Thank you all for coming.

04:41.247 --> 04:42.509
We've got a lot
of work to do, so...

04:42.582 --> 04:44.982
l'd like to say a few words
if l may.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.519
l've prepared a speech
for this occasion.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.111
When l was first activated

04:49.188 --> 04:54.751
on Stardate 48315,
and l found myself

04:54.827 --> 04:56.317
mano a mano
with the Delta Quadrant,

04:56.396 --> 04:58.296
l didn't think
we'd survive a week

04:58.364 --> 05:00.855
let alone three years.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.230
There was strife.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.735
There was discord.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.771
You were all
at each others' throats,

05:05.838 --> 05:08.136
but over time,
l've had the pleasure and pride

05:08.207 --> 05:10.141
of watching this crew
learn to work together

05:10.209 --> 05:12.643
as colleagues, even friends.

05:12.712 --> 05:13.906
Here, here.

05:14.013 --> 05:14.911
Who would have thought

05:15.014 --> 05:16.504
that this eclectic group
of voyagers

05:16.582 --> 05:20.313
could actually become a family?

05:20.386 --> 05:24.322
Starfleet, Maquis, Klingon,
Talaxian, hologram, Borg,

05:24.390 --> 05:26.153
even Mr. Paris.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.193
Granted, we've had our share
of difficulties.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.253
One might say, we've seen
the best of times

05:31.331 --> 05:33.697
and the worst of times.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.165
l'd now like to recount
some of those times

05:35.234 --> 05:36.496
from my unique perspective.

05:36.569 --> 05:37.934
Under the category
of"best of times,"

05:38.004 --> 05:39.596
l invite you all to recall
the moment when l...

05:39.672 --> 05:40.639
Bridge to the Captain.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.106
Janeway here.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.166
We're being hailed--
a vessel off the port bow.

05:44.243 --> 05:45.801
On our way.

05:45.878 --> 05:47.812
Well, perhaps we could
all reconvene later.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.481
They're firing on us, Captain.

05:56.556 --> 06:00.856
lt's a small vessel,
15 life- forms aboard.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.828
Low warp capacity,
limited armaments.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.124
They pose no threat.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.893
Open a channel.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.731
Good day, sir.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.793
Have we offended you
in some way?

06:11.871 --> 06:14.362
You will reverse course
immediately.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.067
This region is in dispute.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.406
You have no business
in Krenim space.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.410
l was under

06:19.479 --> 06:21.913
the impression we were
entering Zahl territory.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.211
The Zahl have
no legitimate claim here.

06:24.283 --> 06:25.750
They have taken what is ours.

06:25.818 --> 06:30.585
Reverse course...
or be destroyed.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.487
With all due respect,
unless you've got

06:35.561 --> 06:37.256
something a little bigger
in your torpedo tubes,

06:37.330 --> 06:39.059
l'm not turning around,

06:39.132 --> 06:40.724
but l'm certainly
willing to discuss

06:40.800 --> 06:42.097
this issue with you.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.635
No discussion!
No compromise!

06:45.671 --> 06:47.298
They are in retreat.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.931
His bark's obviously worse
than his bite.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.498
He seems rather intent.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.543
Let's go to Yellow Alert.

06:51.611 --> 06:52.976
Maintain our course.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.741
Maybe the Zahl
can give us some answers.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.247
As long as you travel
in Zahl territory,

07:05.324 --> 07:06.586
you travel among friends.

07:06.659 --> 07:09.423
l apologize for your mishap
with the Krenim.

07:09.495 --> 07:10.860
lt was hardly traumatic.

07:10.963 --> 07:12.430
But l am curious--

07:12.498 --> 07:15.729
the Krenim claim this region
as their own.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.464
The Krenim dominated
this space many years ago.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.564
They possessed deadly weapons
based on temporal science,

07:21.641 --> 07:24.007
and it kept them in power
for a long time,

07:24.076 --> 07:25.839
but a generation ago,
we fought the Krenim.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.142
We defeated them
and took back the planets

07:28.214 --> 07:29.181
that they had annexed,

07:29.248 --> 07:31.614
dismantled
their military forces.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.618
Their ships still
wander our territory

07:33.686 --> 07:35.620
making grandiose claims.

07:35.688 --> 07:36.916
Don't let them trouble you.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.924
Now, tell me about Voyager--

07:39.992 --> 07:42.859
a single ship alone,
half a galaxy from home--

07:42.929 --> 07:44.260
how exciting for you.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.354
Bridge to Captain.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.262
Sorry to interrupt,
but the Krenim vessel is back.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.096
They're demanding
to speak with you.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.806
Hello again.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.572
You've ignored our warnings,
and now you

07:59.645 --> 08:01.579
consort with our enemy.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.376
Leave this space
or l'll seize your vessel

08:03.416 --> 08:04.678
and send you home
in a cargo container.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.684
Gentlemen, please.

08:06.752 --> 08:10.017
Believe me, we're not
conspiring against you.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.784
Captain, there's a spatial
distortion heading toward us.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.851
Whatever it is, it's huge--
five light- years across

08:15.928 --> 08:17.486
and it's expanding.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.121
Tracking its origin.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.189
A vessel
near the Zahl homeworld.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.199
What?

08:22.268 --> 08:23.428
lt appears to be

08:23.503 --> 08:25.971
a massive buildup
of temporal energy--

08:26.038 --> 08:28.472
some kind
of space- time shock wave.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.508
Tom?

08:29.575 --> 08:32.043
lt's destabilizing
our warp field.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.510
l've lost engines.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.376
Shields to full.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.075
Secure primary systems.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.741
All hands brace for impact.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.636
She's dead.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.469
Shields at 17 percent.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.237
The Krenim are firing again.

09:04.310 --> 09:07.143
We're being hailed.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.145
lt's about time.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.681
On screen.

09:09.749 --> 09:13.378
We've done nothing
to provoke these attacks.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.853
Your presence in our space
is provocation enough.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.949
We've been trying to communicate
with your vessels,

09:20.026 --> 09:23.086
but the only answer l get
is weapons fire.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.686
State your identity.

09:24.764 --> 09:28.222
Captain Janeway
of the Federation Starship...

09:28.301 --> 09:31.862
And your reason
for violating our borders.

09:32.004 --> 09:33.494
We're simply trying
to get home.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.474
lf you'd kindly allow us
to pass through...

09:36.542 --> 09:39.067
No. You will submit
to the Krenim lmperium.

09:39.145 --> 09:41.739
l would prefer
to seize your vessel

09:41.814 --> 09:44.112
before it is too badly damaged.

09:44.183 --> 09:49.246
Surrender now and l will forego
the execution of your crew.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.553
l don't respond well to threats.

09:54.226 --> 09:56.456
Then prepare to be boarded.

10:00.132 --> 10:04.592
All hands, battle stations.

10:04.670 --> 10:08.936
This is turning into
the week of hell.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.642
They're charging weapons.

10:18.718 --> 10:19.810
Three seconds to impact.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.785
Evasive maneuvers.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.652
Direct hit
to our secondary hull.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.351
l still don't understand
why these torpedoes

10:26.425 --> 10:27.858
are ripping
right through our shields.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.495
Their weapons are
chroniton- based.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.728
They're penetrating our shields

10:36.802 --> 10:38.463
because they're
in a state of temporal flux.

10:38.537 --> 10:41.131
Then let's exercise
the better part of valor.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.799
Get us out of here, warp 6.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.342
Warp 6.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.708
No sign of pursuit.

10:46.779 --> 10:47.837
Damage report.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.471
15 wounded.

10:49.548 --> 10:50.606
Main power is down.

10:50.683 --> 10:54.414
We've lost environmental control
on Decks 7 and 8.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.250
The computer is off- line.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.586
Mr. Kim, do we have
any sensors left?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.182
Short- range only.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.124
Commander...

11:03.729 --> 11:05.924
put the ship
on 24- hour Tactical Alert.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.932
Tuvok, analyze
whatever data we've got

11:08.034 --> 11:09.558
on those
chroniton torpedoes.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.934
See if you can
modify our shielding.

11:13.039 --> 11:16.839
When those Krenim attack again,
l want to be ready.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.687
Enter.

11:35.828 --> 11:38.126
Sir, you were correct.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.098
The Zahl homeworld
was the focal point.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.998
lt's erasure has produced
a complete

11:43.102 --> 11:44.933
temporal restoration.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.699
Complete?

11:46.772 --> 11:47.761
Yes, sir.

11:50.476 --> 11:54.412
lf l told you to count
the stars in the cosmos,

11:54.480 --> 11:56.345
would the task ever be complete?

11:57.416 --> 11:58.542
Sir?

11:58.617 --> 12:00.744
Our attempts may be sufficient.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.311
They may be even
relatively successful,

12:03.389 --> 12:05.289
but they will never be complete.

12:05.357 --> 12:08.121
Choose your words
with more precision.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.855
My apologies.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.193
What were the exact results?

12:12.264 --> 12:15.199
The Krenim lmperium
has been restored to power.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.859
Our territory now includes

12:16.936 --> 12:22.238
849 inhabited worlds
spanning 5, 000 parsecs.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.639
Counter- indications?

12:23.709 --> 12:25.336
Negligible.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.969
No superior enemy forces.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.513
No unexpected diseases.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.382
Calculations indicate
a 98 percent restoration.

12:33.452 --> 12:36.649
Our race is thriving once again.

12:36.722 --> 12:39.452
The, uh...

12:39.525 --> 12:42.688
the colony at Kyana Prime...

12:43.863 --> 12:46.331
that was restored as well?

12:47.366 --> 12:49.891
No, sir.

12:49.969 --> 12:50.936
ln this timeline,

12:51.003 --> 12:53.028
the lmperium does not extend
that far.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.244
Then our mission has failed.

13:01.747 --> 13:04.375
Begin calculations
for the next incursion.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.647
Sir, we have just accomplished
the impossible--

13:07.720 --> 13:10.188
a 98 percent restoration.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.554
Another incursion,
even a minor one,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.388
could undermine everything.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.226
We should dismantle this weapon
and rejoin our people.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.629
No, not until every colony...

13:20.699 --> 13:21.791
every individual...

13:21.867 --> 13:23.767
every blade of grass
is restored.

13:23.836 --> 13:27.465
You said yourself,
our task will never be complete.

13:27.540 --> 13:32.239
Please, we should be satisfied
with what we have accomplished.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.246
For 200 years, we have
never come this close.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.906
Not close enough.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.540
lf l may speak my thoughts.

13:39.518 --> 13:41.247
Many among the crew
are convinced

13:41.320 --> 13:43.220
that you have lost
your objectivity.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.119
They think your quest
for...precision

13:46.192 --> 13:47.420
is unrealistic.

13:49.028 --> 13:50.427
Sir...

13:50.496 --> 13:53.397
we will never restore
100 percent of what we had.

13:53.465 --> 13:55.797
We can manipulate
the time continuum

13:55.868 --> 13:57.631
for another ten centuries--

13:57.703 --> 14:00.069
it will never happen.

14:01.707 --> 14:05.700
Return to your station and begin
a new set of calculations.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.110
ls that clear?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.375
Perfectly.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.849
You surprise me, Obrist.

14:14.653 --> 14:17.019
After so many years,

14:17.089 --> 14:20.616
you still perceive time
through conventional eyes.

14:21.927 --> 14:25.124
"Never" is a word
that has no meaning here.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.791
As long as we stay
on this vessel,

14:27.867 --> 14:31.564
protected from space- time,

14:31.637 --> 14:35.004
we have all eternity
to accomplish our mission.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.010
Of course, sir.

14:52.024 --> 14:52.991
Return fire.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.719
Weapons are down.

14:54.793 --> 14:56.988
My attempt to modify
the shielding was unsuccessful.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.723
Captain,
during that last exchange

14:58.797 --> 14:59.729
we did some damage.

14:59.798 --> 15:00.730
The Krenim's aft shields
are down.

15:00.833 --> 15:01.697
They're vulnerable.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.099
We've got to hit them now!

15:03.168 --> 15:04.157
With what?

15:04.236 --> 15:05.533
Phaser banks are burned out.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.094
Torpedo launchers are off- line.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.503
Doctor to Bridge.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.201
We've got
a power overload in Sick Bay.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.210
l need an engineer
down here right away.

15:12.278 --> 15:13.210
Stand by, Doctor.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.678
Harry, can you handle it
from here?

15:14.747 --> 15:15.907
No, sir.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.573
The overload's spreading.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.447
Half that deck is going
to blow in less than

15:19.518 --> 15:21.008
- five minutes.
- Doctor, get

15:21.086 --> 15:22.075
your patients out of there.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.746
All hands,
this is the Bridge.

15:23.822 --> 15:25.881
Emergency evacuation, Deck 5.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.188
How many torpedoes
do we have left?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.693
Eleven.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.161
Arm four of them.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.391
Stand by
to open the launch doors.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.490
We're going to deploy them
like mines.

15:35.567 --> 15:36.898
Aye, Captain.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.698
Tom, l need your finesse.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.298
Let the Krenim get
within 5, 000 meters of us.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.705
No problem.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.073
Keep moving.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.772
Quickly. Please, move quickly.

15:47.846 --> 15:51.577
Warning. Structural collapse
in three minutes.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.110
Torpedoes armed and ready.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.710
They're within range.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.120
Tuvok...

15:58.190 --> 15:59.418
do it.

16:09.735 --> 16:10.895
Got'em!

16:15.574 --> 16:17.508
The conduits
on Deck 5 are overloading.

16:17.576 --> 16:18.873
30 seconds till they blow.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.138
Keep moving.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.742
Please, hurry.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.306
That's it.

16:25.384 --> 16:29.514
Warning. Structural collapse
in 20 seconds.

16:32.391 --> 16:33.915
15 seconds!

16:33.993 --> 16:38.123
Warning. Structural collapse
in 10 seconds.

16:39.431 --> 16:42.525
Warning. Structural collapse
in five...

16:42.601 --> 16:44.068
four...

16:44.136 --> 16:46.070
three...two...

16:46.138 --> 16:47.571
one.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.677
Report!

16:58.717 --> 17:03.177
Sections 10 through 53
on Deck 5...

17:03.255 --> 17:04.381
are gone.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.945
Casualties?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.016
Reports are coming in.

17:08.093 --> 17:10.857
12 wounded--
many of them critically.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.021
The Doctor is setting up
a triage facility

17:13.098 --> 17:14.531
in the Mess Hall.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.534
Two crew members were killed
in the breach.

17:17.736 --> 17:19.727
Stand down Red Alert.

17:19.805 --> 17:22.773
Assemble a security team.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.273
Survey the ship deck by deck.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.277
l want a full damage report.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.014
l'll be in my ready room.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.584
You have the Bridge...

17:36.655 --> 17:38.919
what's left of it.

17:57.276 --> 17:58.607
Come in.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.812
Sorry about the mess.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.848
You should see my place.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.350
They haven't looked as bad
since my old Academy days.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.318
ls there something on your mind?

18:08.387 --> 18:09.649
Yes,

18:09.721 --> 18:11.018
but you're not going to like it.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.058
That's never stopped you before.

18:14.526 --> 18:15.550
Broken.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.294
l'll be blunt.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.855
Our strategy's failing.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.434
lt was a good idea
to try and create

18:23.502 --> 18:25.197
temporal shielding,
but it isn't working.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.238
Not yet, but it will.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.171
With every attack,
we gather more information

18:29.241 --> 18:30.503
about their chroniton weapons.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.100
How many more attacks
will it take?

18:32.177 --> 18:34.372
Before long, there won't be
a ship left to protect.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.848
We don't have a choice.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.645
Maybe we do.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.652
Here comes the part
l'm not going to like.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.714
We should consider
leaving the ship behind,

18:46.792 --> 18:50.193
breaking the crew into smaller
groups-- escape pods, shuttles--

18:50.262 --> 18:51.923
each one with its own course.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.794
lf all goes well,
we'll rendezvous

18:53.866 --> 18:55.697
on the other side
of Krenim space.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.202
Then what?

18:58.270 --> 19:00.795
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it,

19:00.873 --> 19:03.433
but at least we'd be increasing
our chances of survival.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.742
Abandon ship?

19:08.814 --> 19:10.805
The answer's no.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.477
l'm not breaking up
the family, Chakotay.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.349
We're stronger as a team.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.048
One crew, one ship.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.385
The moment we split apart,

19:19.458 --> 19:21.392
we lose the ability
to pool our talents.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.825
We become vulnerable.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.022
We'll get picked off one by one.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.931
Now, l say we make
our stand together.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.401
To be honest, l wasn't too fond
of the idea myself.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.668
As long as Voyager's
in one piece,

19:36.742 --> 19:38.903
we stay.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.609
We stay.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.879
This looks like
it stayed in one piece.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.419
Where does this go?

19:48.487 --> 19:49.852
My lucky teacup.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.287
Right over here.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.723
Red Alert.
We're under attack.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.727
Two Krenim warships
off the port bow.

20:11.009 --> 20:13.170
When are they going
to get us out of here?

20:13.245 --> 20:16.146
Try to relax.
Let's get back to the game.

20:16.215 --> 20:20.709
Grace Kelly...
cat burglars...the Riviera.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.617
Name the title...

20:22.688 --> 20:24.622
and the male lead.

20:24.690 --> 20:25.987
To Catch a Thief.

20:26.058 --> 20:26.990
Right.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.253
Clark Gable.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.727
Wrong. Cary Grant.

20:30.796 --> 20:31.728
l've seen the holographic

20:31.797 --> 20:33.822
version twice--
it's Clark Gable.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.628
l think you're getting them
confused

20:35.701 --> 20:38.226
because they have the same
initials. lt was Grant.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.736
No more
20th- century entertainment.

20:39.805 --> 20:40.772
l'm terrible at it.

20:40.839 --> 20:41.828
My turn.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.206
Category...athletics.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.302
Fire away.

20:47.379 --> 20:48.641
A notorious athlete...

20:48.714 --> 20:51.205
parrises' squares,
championship finals...

20:51.283 --> 20:53.513
uh...controversial decision.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.951
M'Kota R'Cho--
the first and only Klingon

20:56.021 --> 20:57.318
to ever play the game.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.880
During the finals of 2342,
one of the referees

20:59.958 --> 21:01.755
called a penalty
against his team.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.953
R'Cho strangled him.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.258
lmpressive.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.128
You're looking at a true
sports aficionado.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.169
Let's see...how about
interstellar history?

21:11.236 --> 21:13.227
Oh, great. You pick
the one subject

21:13.305 --> 21:15.102
l almost failed at the Academy.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.197
Go ahead and ask...

21:17.276 --> 21:18.243
Hey, you all right?

21:18.310 --> 21:19.242
Mm- hmm.

21:20.412 --> 21:22.312
lt just...

21:22.381 --> 21:23.643
hurts a little.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.881
lt feels like we've
been here for days.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.980
Actually, it's been
about six hours.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.457
Try to hang on, B'Elanna.

21:34.526 --> 21:37.495
The emergency crews are
going to find us any minute.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.293
Come on, hurry up!

21:43.769 --> 21:45.999
Go ahead and ask
your stupid question,

21:46.071 --> 21:47.038
before l pass out

21:47.105 --> 21:49.130
and you don't have
anybody to play with.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.299
Okay.

21:52.377 --> 21:55.141
Um...it's a famous ship.

21:55.213 --> 21:57.374
Uh...pre- warp civilization...

21:57.449 --> 21:59.781
um...Montana...

21:59.851 --> 22:03.844
uh...second stage
had chemical engines.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.320
Another clue.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.018
Vulcans, um...

22:07.092 --> 22:08.719
Earth...first contact.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.659
Oh, right, right.

22:10.729 --> 22:14.529
Um...uh...uh...
Zephram Cochrane's ship...

22:14.599 --> 22:16.464
What was it called?

22:16.535 --> 22:18.503
God, it's on the tip
of my tongue.

22:19.571 --> 22:20.936
Okay, okay.
Here, you better lie down now.

22:21.006 --> 22:21.973
Enough trivia for now.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.405
No.
No, l'm going to get this one.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.075
Lieutenant. Ensign.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.979
lt's about time.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.075
What happened to the turbolift?

22:34.152 --> 22:35.813
During the last attack,

22:35.887 --> 22:37.980
19 main power relays
were severed.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.718
The entire turbolift system
is nonoperational.

22:40.792 --> 22:43.818
Get me to the Jefferies tube
network on Deck 1 1.

22:43.895 --> 22:46.591
The EPS manifold
must have taken a hit, too.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.496
Seven of Nine
can go take a look.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.000
We have to get you
to the Doctor.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.093
All right.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.137
The Phoenix.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.399
What?

22:54.473 --> 22:56.441
The correct response
to your query.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.203
The vessel Ensign Kim
was describing--

22:58.276 --> 22:59.675
it was designated the Phoenix.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.804
Not bad.
l didn't realize

23:01.913 --> 23:03.505
you knew so much
about Earth history.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.574
l don't, but the Borg were
present during those events.

23:06.651 --> 23:07.583
Really?

23:07.652 --> 23:08.880
lt's a complicated story.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.080
Perhaps another time.

23:10.155 --> 23:11.520
l think so.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.286
Transverse bulkheads.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.849
We've set up
emergency force fields

23:15.927 --> 23:17.792
between all decks
and every section.

23:17.863 --> 23:19.626
ln the event
of a cataclysmic breach,

23:19.698 --> 23:21.495
most of us will be protected.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.828
lngenious.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.839
Actually, you can thank
Mr. Paris.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.272
He came up with the idea.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.742
l was inspired
by an ancient steamship--

23:32.811 --> 23:33.971
the Titanic.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.410
The engineers of the day

23:35.480 --> 23:37.505
constructed a series
of special bulkheads--

23:37.582 --> 23:39.641
sort of like a honeycomb--

23:39.718 --> 23:41.185
that would lower into place

23:41.253 --> 23:42.743
if they suffered
a major hull breach.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.379
ln theory,
they could stay afloat

23:44.456 --> 23:46.185
even with half the ship
filled with water.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.657
The Titanic?

23:47.726 --> 23:49.591
As l recall, it sank.

23:49.661 --> 23:51.891
Well, let's just say,

23:51.963 --> 23:54.295
l've made a few improvements.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.300
l knew your fixation
with history

23:56.368 --> 23:58.700
would come in handy someday.
Good work.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.067
Doctor to Lieutenant Paris.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.196
Go ahead, Doc.

24:01.239 --> 24:02.467
Report to the Mess Hall at once.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.441
More wounded are on the way.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.374
l'll be right there.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.912
l'm a popular guy today.

24:47.185 --> 24:49.085
Seven of Nine to Tuvok.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.519
Tuvok here.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.614
There is an undetonated
chroniton torpedo

24:52.691 --> 24:54.625
lodged in the starboard
Jefferies tube

24:54.693 --> 24:56.684
on Deck 1 1, Section 2.

24:56.761 --> 24:59.628
The warhead is still active.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.427
Do not attempt to disarm it.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.195
Hold your position
and wait for my arrival.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.464
ls that clear?

25:05.537 --> 25:07.505
Arrive quickly.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.910
l've stopped
the internal bleeding.

25:15.981 --> 25:19.007
You're going to be okay.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.882
ls that your expert opinion?

25:23.421 --> 25:25.048
That's a promise.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.884
l know.
lt still hurts.

25:29.961 --> 25:31.553
No, it's all right.

25:33.565 --> 25:36.193
You've got a ruptured vertebra.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.462
l'll see if l can repair it.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.094
Mr. Paris, your assistance,
please.

25:39.170 --> 25:40.102
Give me a minute.

25:40.171 --> 25:41.934
Now, Lieutenant.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.207
l'll be right back.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.768
Don't go anywhere.

25:47.846 --> 25:49.404
ln case you hadn't noticed,

25:49.481 --> 25:51.847
B'Elanna is not
the only patient here.

25:51.917 --> 25:52.849
She's in pain.

25:52.918 --> 25:54.283
But no longer
in danger of dying.

25:54.352 --> 25:56.115
That is the first rule
of medical triage--

25:56.187 --> 25:57.484
make sure the patient will live,

25:57.556 --> 25:58.818
then move on to the next one.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.120
Emotional detachment
is essential.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.626
Otherwise, you risk
impairing your judgment.

26:03.662 --> 26:05.129
l understand.

26:05.196 --> 26:07.528
You could be seeing more
of your friends in here soon.

26:07.599 --> 26:10.762
lf you can't handle it,
l'll find another assistant.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.325
You can leave.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.872
"Physician, heal thyself."

26:17.008 --> 26:20.307
What's that supposed to mean?

26:20.378 --> 26:22.073
Well, it seems to me
that you're the one

26:22.147 --> 26:23.671
who's getting emotional
around here.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.187
Several weeks ago,

26:30.255 --> 26:33.486
just before the conduits
on Deck 5 breached,

26:33.558 --> 26:35.719
l saw Ensign Strickler
and Crewman Emmanuel

26:35.794 --> 26:37.022
at the end of a corridor.

26:37.095 --> 26:40.826
They were...trying
to reach the Jefferies tube.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.634
l kept the hatch open,

26:45.704 --> 26:48.400
waited for them
as long as l could--

26:48.473 --> 26:50.441
but time ran out.

26:51.743 --> 26:55.235
l had no choice
but to seal the hatch.

27:00.719 --> 27:02.744
That must have been
very hard for you.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.789
My point is,
it could have been worse.

27:04.856 --> 27:07.723
Had l lost my objectivity,
l might have kept the hatch open

27:07.792 --> 27:09.259
and everyone
would have perished.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.152
This man has
damaged lung tissue.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.527
Treat him with inaprovaline.

27:16.835 --> 27:19.167
lf we attempt
to dislodge the torpedo

27:19.237 --> 27:20.261
or move it
with the transporters,

27:20.338 --> 27:21.965
it will most likely detonate.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.098
Can we disarm it?

27:23.174 --> 27:26.041
No. The warhead
is already destabilizing.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.443
l estimate it will explode
in less than two minutes.

27:28.513 --> 27:31.710
lf we reroute emergency
power to this junction,

27:31.783 --> 27:33.250
and erect a level- 10
force field,

27:33.318 --> 27:35.183
it should be enough
to contain the explosion.

27:35.253 --> 27:36.185
We must hurry.

27:36.254 --> 27:37.186
lf l can determine

27:37.255 --> 27:38.916
the exact temporal variance
of this torpedo,

27:38.990 --> 27:40.651
it will help us perfect
the temporal shielding.

27:40.725 --> 27:41.749
There is no time.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.726
We may never have
this opportunity again.

27:43.795 --> 27:46.525
l am giving you an order. Now!

27:46.598 --> 27:50.159
The temporal variance
is 1. 47 microseconds.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.167
Excellent work.

27:51.236 --> 27:52.567
But if you disobey
my orders again,

27:52.637 --> 27:53.569
l will be forced to...

28:03.948 --> 28:08.180
Captain's Log, Stardate 51268. 4.

28:08.253 --> 28:12.121
This morning's attack destroyed
the power grid on Deck 1 1.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.623
No casualties this time,

28:13.692 --> 28:16.456
but the replicator system
was badly damaged.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.122
We've gone to emergency rations.

28:19.197 --> 28:22.189
As a result, the situation
has gotten a little worse.

28:22.267 --> 28:25.134
Environmental controls
continue to fail.

28:25.203 --> 28:28.536
Seven decks have been rendered
uninhabitable

28:28.606 --> 28:31.336
and we've had
to relocate the crew.

28:31.409 --> 28:34.640
Quarters are close,
nerves are frayed,

28:34.713 --> 28:37.307
and l'm not sure what's
more difficult to maintain--

28:37.382 --> 28:40.476
Voyager's systems
or the crew's morale.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.918
What's important
is that we're together,

28:42.987 --> 28:47.720
working towards a single goal--
survival.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.050
Happy birthday.

28:50.128 --> 28:51.925
Happy what?

28:51.996 --> 28:54.226
Today is May 20.

28:57.535 --> 28:58.968
ls it?

29:00.638 --> 29:02.970
l thought
we were still in April.

29:03.041 --> 29:05.009
Guess l've lost track
of the time.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.477
Well, this should help.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.279
lt's beautiful.

29:15.353 --> 29:17.844
19th century--
mechanical movement.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.446
lt's a replica
of the chronometer

29:19.524 --> 29:21.515
worn by Captain Cray
of the British Navy.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.756
His ship was hit
by a typhoon in the Pacific.

29:24.829 --> 29:27.161
Everyone back in England
thought they were killed,

29:27.232 --> 29:29.132
but eight months later,

29:29.200 --> 29:31.828
Cray sailed his ship
into London harbor.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.530
There wasn't much left of it--

29:33.605 --> 29:37.905
a few planks, half a sail,
but he got his crew home.

29:41.079 --> 29:44.173
l appreciate the sentiment,
but l can't keep this.

29:44.249 --> 29:45.443
Recycle it.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.917
We can't afford to waste energy
on nonessentials.

29:47.986 --> 29:51.251
Kathryn, l replicated this
months ago.

29:51.322 --> 29:52.880
l've been saving it.
l wanted you to have it.

29:52.957 --> 29:58.122
That watch represents a meal,
a hypospray or a pair of boots.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.562
lt could mean the difference
between life and death one day.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.091
Enter.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.731
Reporting for duty, Lieutenant.

30:38.803 --> 30:40.703
What is our agenda?

30:40.772 --> 30:42.399
After we make
your customary rounds,

30:42.473 --> 30:44.304
l'd like to take you
to Deflector Control.

30:44.375 --> 30:47.606
l had an inspiration last night
about the temporal shielding.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.976
Excellent.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.240
You've been damaged.

30:54.319 --> 30:55.752
A minor laceration.

30:55.820 --> 30:58.618
l've offered to assist you
with your personal grooming.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.090
There are some tasks l would
rather perform myself.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.159
Unacceptable.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.558
You're risking further injury.

31:03.628 --> 31:06.290
Shaving is hardly
a life- threatening activity.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.930
Tell me about your inspiration.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.129
We've been trying
to match our shields

31:13.204 --> 31:15.502
to the temporal variance
of their torpedoes.

31:15.573 --> 31:18.201
But l believe we must
also match the deflector array

31:18.276 --> 31:19.937
to the inverse of that variance.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.377
Fascinating. When will
the deflectors be ready?

31:23.448 --> 31:24.380
They're ready now,

31:24.449 --> 31:26.246
but the modifications
are untested.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.342
Then our rounds can wait.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.410
Take me to Deflector Control.

31:35.960 --> 31:36.927
Seven.

31:36.995 --> 31:37.984
Ensign.

31:38.062 --> 31:38.994
A friend of yours?

31:39.097 --> 31:40.997
My...cabin mate.

31:41.099 --> 31:43.363
As a Borg, l was accustomed
to cohabitating

31:43.434 --> 31:45.095
with thousands of other drones.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.761
But l find it
significantly more difficult

31:46.838 --> 31:48.328
to live with a single human.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.498
ln what way?

31:49.574 --> 31:52.042
Ensign Brooks is negligent.

31:52.143 --> 31:54.270
She leaves her equipment
lying around the quarters

31:54.345 --> 31:55.835
and her clothing on the floor.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.779
lndeed. l have found
that most humans

31:57.849 --> 31:59.043
are less than meticulous

31:59.117 --> 32:00.914
when it comes
to their domestic habits.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.316
lndeed.

32:02.353 --> 32:03.581
Mr. Vulcan, sir.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.089
A tactical question if l may?

32:06.157 --> 32:07.181
You may.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.384
We're just about done

32:08.459 --> 32:10.620
rebuilding
the internal security sensors

32:10.695 --> 32:12.822
and we're ready
to program the audio signal.

32:12.897 --> 32:15.923
Do you want it to say,
"intruder alert"?

32:16.034 --> 32:18.628
Or should we try something
a little more dramatic

32:18.703 --> 32:19.761
like"warning, intruder alert"?

32:19.837 --> 32:22.567
Or..."intruders among us,
danger!

32:22.640 --> 32:24.130
Danger! lntruders among us"?

32:24.208 --> 32:26.608
"lntruder alert" will suffice.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.908
Yeah, go with a classic.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.174
Understood, sir.

32:31.983 --> 32:34.008
And you believe
you have difficulties.

32:35.219 --> 32:36.948
All hands to battle stations.

32:37.021 --> 32:38.989
Krenim vessels approaching.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.285
Repeat: all hands
to battle stations!

32:41.359 --> 32:44.886
Go to Deflector Control and
bring the new shields on line.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.191
We will test them in battle.

33:04.215 --> 33:07.184
Computer, activate
tactile interface.

33:07.251 --> 33:08.650
Weapons status?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.789
Phasers are still on line.

33:11.856 --> 33:13.790
Torpedo launchers
are inoperative.

33:13.858 --> 33:15.655
The Krenim are
within visual range.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.786
On screen.

33:17.862 --> 33:19.489
Seven's modified
temporal shields

33:19.564 --> 33:20.792
should be on line in a moment.

33:20.865 --> 33:22.423
lt's a warship.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.229
You know the routine.

33:24.302 --> 33:25.929
Evasive maneuvers.

33:27.405 --> 33:28.599
They're matching course.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.334
Hold them off
as long as you can.

33:30.408 --> 33:31.375
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

33:31.442 --> 33:32.932
Where are those shields?

33:33.044 --> 33:34.841
Stand by.

33:34.912 --> 33:35.936
They're charging weapons.

33:36.047 --> 33:38.413
Seven, we could use a little

33:38.483 --> 33:40.417
of that Borg efficiency
right about now.

33:40.485 --> 33:41.474
l can't shake them off!

33:41.552 --> 33:43.144
They're targeting the Bridge!

33:44.589 --> 33:46.386
Temporal shielding is on line.

33:46.457 --> 33:47.651
They're firing!

33:47.725 --> 33:49.056
Full port thrusters!

33:55.133 --> 33:57.465
Temporal shields are holding.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.524
No damage.

33:58.603 --> 34:00.935
Hail them.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.098
Channel open.

34:06.511 --> 34:09.911
Krenim vessels,
this is the Captain of Voyager.

34:10.014 --> 34:11.413
You may have noticed

34:11.482 --> 34:14.507
we have a defense
against your torpedoes now.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.815
l suggest you stand down.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.549
No response.

34:27.697 --> 34:29.928
Their mistake.
Bring the ship about.

34:30.034 --> 34:33.197
We're going through their space
whether they like it or not.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.616
We are within range
of the Garenor homeworld.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.844
Set temporal coordinates.

34:52.255 --> 34:54.018
Full power to the weapon.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.726
Prepare for total erasure
of the species.

34:59.797 --> 35:01.492
Targeting the focal point.

35:04.535 --> 35:05.934
Ready.

35:08.139 --> 35:10.198
Fire.

35:20.985 --> 35:23.078
Temporal incursion in progress.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.816
Trace elements?

35:26.824 --> 35:28.121
Diminishing.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.784
Counter- indications?

35:29.861 --> 35:31.089
None so far.

35:31.162 --> 35:34.427
Organisms and structures
are being eradicated.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.060
Track the temporal wave front

35:37.135 --> 35:38.432
as it passes
through their system.

35:38.503 --> 35:43.406
l want to monitor every change
in the timeline as it occurs.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.601
Yes, sir.

35:45.676 --> 35:48.144
Captain, the Krenim warship
is in pursuit,

35:48.212 --> 35:50.180
but their weapons
are not powered.

35:50.248 --> 35:51.772
Hmm. They don't know
what to do with us

35:51.849 --> 35:53.817
now that we're shielded
against their torpedoes.

35:54.852 --> 35:56.251
Captain, there's some kind

35:56.320 --> 35:58.515
of spatial distortion
heading toward us.

35:58.589 --> 35:59.851
Sensor readings are erratic.

35:59.924 --> 36:01.323
l can't identify the phenomenon.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.256
What's the source?

36:03.294 --> 36:05.592
Unknown,
but it originated approximately

36:05.663 --> 36:07.563
20 light- years
from our position.

36:07.632 --> 36:10.157
lt looks like a shock wave
in the fabric of space- time.

36:10.234 --> 36:11.861
Tom, get us out of here.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.166
We'll never outrun it, Captain.

36:14.238 --> 36:15.865
Maybe our new shields will help.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.565
All hands, brace for impact.

36:26.317 --> 36:27.716
You were correct, Captain.

36:27.785 --> 36:30.185
The temporal shielding
has protected us.

36:30.254 --> 36:32.222
The wave front has passed.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.257
Captain?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.357
Report.

36:40.431 --> 36:41.864
lt's definitely a Krenim ship.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.493
ldentical hull markings,
same biospectral frequency...

36:44.569 --> 36:46.935
but it's half the size.

36:47.004 --> 36:47.936
Limited fire power.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.199
What happened to the warship?

36:49.273 --> 36:51.468
l'm not picking it up
on long- range sensors.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.567
lt looks like
this entire part of space

36:53.644 --> 36:54.804
has changed somehow.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.143
The last time l checked,
this region was filled

36:57.215 --> 36:58.739
with Krenim colonies
and vessels.

36:58.816 --> 37:01.751
l just ran a scan and
sensors show no colonies

37:01.852 --> 37:03.615
and just a handful
of Krenim ships.

37:03.654 --> 37:07.556
Harry, transfer all your sensor
data about that shock wave

37:07.625 --> 37:09.024
to the Astrometrics Lab.

37:09.093 --> 37:10.082
Yes, ma'am.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.095
Tell Seven of Nine
to meet me there.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.961
Captain, Astrometrics
took heavy damage a few days go.

37:15.032 --> 37:16.363
lt's off- line.

37:16.434 --> 37:17.867
Well, let's get it back on line.

37:17.935 --> 37:20.301
lt appears that the Krenim
lmperium has vanished.

37:20.371 --> 37:23.135
Our troubles could be over
and l'd like to find out why.

37:26.143 --> 37:27.633
Something went wrong.

37:27.712 --> 37:29.873
The entire Krenim lmperium--

37:30.014 --> 37:32.278
it's reverted
to a pre- warp state.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.011
Not possible.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.450
Our calculations were perfect.

37:37.955 --> 37:39.820
l may have an explanation.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.755
There's an anomalous
temporal reading

37:41.826 --> 37:43.350
20 light- years from here.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.088
lt's coming from a vessel.

37:46.530 --> 37:48.225
What vessel?

37:48.299 --> 37:52.360
Component 049- beta,
a ship called Voyager.

37:52.436 --> 37:55.132
That ship was classified
as an inert component.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.731
lt shouldn't be generating
a temporal field.

37:57.808 --> 37:59.070
But it is...

37:59.143 --> 38:01.873
and it was enough to throw
off our calculations.

38:04.682 --> 38:06.115
Take me to them.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.323
Sensors are on line.

38:19.096 --> 38:20.256
Power levels are stable.

38:20.331 --> 38:22.595
ls the astrometric database
still intact?

38:23.701 --> 38:24.668
Yes.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.794
Display the scans
we made of this region

38:26.871 --> 38:28.463
before the temporal
shock wave hit.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.470
Spatial grid 005.

38:33.544 --> 38:37.981
The Krenim lmperium--
over 200 star systems,

38:38.049 --> 38:39.744
900 planets,

38:39.817 --> 38:43.617
thousands of warp- capable
vessels and now...

38:45.690 --> 38:48.420
after the shock wave, everything
seems to have changed.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.823
Run a new scan.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.555
Spatial grid 005.

38:54.632 --> 38:57.066
Same space, different
configuration.

38:57.134 --> 38:58.931
Exactly as Chakotay said.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.597
The lmperium
appears to have been reduced

39:01.706 --> 39:04.675
to a few planets,
and a smattering of vessels.

39:05.943 --> 39:08.537
lt appears that someone...

39:08.612 --> 39:12.013
or something
has altered history.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.313
But why weren't we affected?

39:14.385 --> 39:16.853
Perhaps we were protected
from the changes

39:16.921 --> 39:18.388
by our temporal shielding.

39:18.456 --> 39:19.787
Mmm.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.848
So, the question remains:

39:21.926 --> 39:25.327
What caused that shock
wave in the first place?

39:26.697 --> 39:29.393
See if you can track
it back to its origin.

39:29.467 --> 39:33.426
The shock wave emanated from
a planet 20 light- years away.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.335
The Garenor homeworld.

39:35.406 --> 39:36.566
The Garenor?

39:36.640 --> 39:38.232
We passed their planet
three weeks ago.

39:40.811 --> 39:43.041
The planet
is no longer populated.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.139
What?

39:45.216 --> 39:47.616
Astrometric data indicate

39:47.685 --> 39:49.744
that the instant
the shock wave appeared,

39:49.820 --> 39:52.448
the Garenor species vanished.

39:54.759 --> 39:57.227
Erased from history.

39:58.696 --> 39:59.822
Captain?

40:01.532 --> 40:03.056
l'm no authority on time travel.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.932
ln fact, l've made it my goal
in life to avoid it, but...

40:09.173 --> 40:12.301
this sounds to me like
a causality paradox.

40:12.376 --> 40:14.037
Think about it.

40:14.111 --> 40:18.411
A temporal shock wave
eliminates a single species

40:18.482 --> 40:21.747
and all of history
changes as a result.

40:23.053 --> 40:25.613
An intriguing theory.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.623
Perhaps the Krenim
are responsible.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.716
They do possess
temporal technology.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.285
But why would they alter history
to undermine themselves?

40:32.363 --> 40:35.332
No, we're still missing
a big piece of the puzzle.

40:35.399 --> 40:36.627
Run another scan of the...

40:43.674 --> 40:45.141
Scanning the vessel.

40:45.209 --> 40:46.471
Their defensive shielding

40:46.544 --> 40:48.910
is generating a level- 9
temporal disruption.

40:48.979 --> 40:50.003
Collect samples--

40:50.114 --> 40:52.605
two life- forms,
ten square meters of the hull.

40:52.683 --> 40:54.048
Yes, sir.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.779
Disable their shielding.

40:55.853 --> 40:58.515
Prepare to initiate
a temporal incursion.

41:00.424 --> 41:02.756
That entire vessel's
in a state of temporal flux.

41:02.827 --> 41:05.796
lt's like they exist
outside space- time.

41:05.863 --> 41:07.763
They're scanning us.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.099
Get a lock on them!

41:11.168 --> 41:13.830
l'm trying, but l can't
isolate their signals.

41:13.904 --> 41:15.030
We are being hailed.

41:15.105 --> 41:16.163
On screen.

41:18.008 --> 41:19.771
State your identity.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.836
l'm Captain Janeway of the
Federation Starship Voyager.

41:22.913 --> 41:24.710
Who are you,
and where are my men?

41:24.782 --> 41:26.579
l am Annorax
of the Krenim lmperium.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.845
We've transferred your crewmen
to my vessel

41:28.919 --> 41:30.386
for further analysis.

41:30.454 --> 41:33.582
Your ship does not come
from this Quadrant.

41:33.657 --> 41:38.356
We come from Earth-- a planet
65, 000 light- years from here.

41:38.429 --> 41:40.124
We're on our way home.

41:40.197 --> 41:41.789
l see.

41:41.866 --> 41:43.424
We've been observing
some rather...

41:43.501 --> 41:46.470
unusual events in the region.

41:46.537 --> 41:48.801
lt seems your lmperium...

41:48.873 --> 41:49.805
never existed.

41:49.874 --> 41:52.308
Perhaps you could shed
some light on this.

41:52.376 --> 41:54.003
That doesn't concern you.

41:54.144 --> 41:57.341
What is important
is that you understand

41:57.414 --> 41:59.848
that l bear you no hostility...

41:59.917 --> 42:02.385
but you have diverted me
from my mission.

42:02.486 --> 42:03.976
Your mission?

42:07.491 --> 42:10.722
You're responsible
for the changes in the timeline.

42:10.794 --> 42:12.762
You're a long way
from your world.

42:12.830 --> 42:16.698
ln a manner of speaking,
so am l.

42:16.767 --> 42:20.726
Unfortunately, only one of us
can go home again.

42:20.804 --> 42:23.500
Your sacrifice will restore
the lives

42:23.574 --> 42:25.906
of countless millions.

42:25.976 --> 42:28.069
l'm sorry.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.610
l'm reading a massive
energy buildup--

42:31.682 --> 42:32.614
some kind of weapon.

42:32.683 --> 42:33.945
Shields.

42:39.857 --> 42:42.155
Temporal shields are weakening.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.921
Captain, that energy beam--

42:43.994 --> 42:45.825
it's pushing Voyager
out of the space- time continuum.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.831
He's trying to erase us
from history.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.163
l have scanned
their propulsion system.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.500
Their vessel's mass prevents
them from exceeding warp 6.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.233
We can escape.

42:56.307 --> 42:57.399
Captain, l must remind you,

42:57.474 --> 43:00.136
our structural integrity
is still impaired.

43:00.210 --> 43:01.199
lf we go to warp now,

43:01.278 --> 43:03.212
the damage to Voyager
will be extreme.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.872
What about Tom and Chakotay?

43:04.949 --> 43:06.541
We'll have to come back
for them.

43:06.617 --> 43:08.380
All hands
clear the outer sections

43:08.452 --> 43:10.386
and prepare
for wide- scale breaches.

43:10.454 --> 43:13.981
Tuvok, activate
the transverse bulkheads.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.321
Temporal shields are failing.

43:18.395 --> 43:19.828
Engage warp 7.

43:20.931 --> 43:21.989
They're not in pursuit.

43:24.001 --> 43:25.263
We are losing the outer hull.

43:25.336 --> 43:26.735
Transverse bulkheads
are holding.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.250
Each of you has done your best,

43:40.317 --> 43:41.682
but determination alone

43:41.752 --> 43:43.879
isn't going to hold
this ship together.

43:43.954 --> 43:46.354
lt's time we faced reality.

43:46.423 --> 43:49.483
We've lost nine decks.

43:49.560 --> 43:52.393
More than half the ship
has been destroyed.

43:52.463 --> 43:55.398
Life support is nearly gone.

43:55.466 --> 43:59.527
Voyager can no longer
sustain its crew.

43:59.603 --> 44:02.504
l promised myself that l
would never give this order,

44:02.606 --> 44:05.040
that l would never break up
this family,

44:05.075 --> 44:06.804
but asking you to stay...

44:09.313 --> 44:12.282
would be asking you to die.

44:12.349 --> 44:13.646
You will proceed

44:13.717 --> 44:16.345
to the escape pods,
and evacuate this vessel.

44:16.420 --> 44:18.411
Set your course
for the Alpha Quadrant.

44:18.489 --> 44:21.219
Along the way,
try to find allies.

44:21.291 --> 44:22.918
Secure faster ships if you can.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.790
Anything to get home.

44:24.862 --> 44:25.794
The senior staff and l

44:25.863 --> 44:27.558
will remain on board
as long as possible.

44:27.631 --> 44:31.397
We will try, somehow,
to rescue Tom and Chakotay.

44:31.468 --> 44:34.733
The escape pods are equipped
with subspace beacons.

44:34.805 --> 44:36.397
That's how we'll keep track
of you.

44:36.473 --> 44:39.271
When we find each other again--

44:39.343 --> 44:41.470
and we will...

44:41.545 --> 44:44.912
we will find each other again--

44:44.982 --> 44:47.974
l expect all of you
to be in one piece

44:48.052 --> 44:51.078
with some interesting stories
to tell.

44:54.058 --> 44:55.582
Good luck.
