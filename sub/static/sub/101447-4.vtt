WEBVTT

00:17.308 --> 00:18.685
Come here, my sweet.

00:19.728 --> 00:20.979
I've missed you.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.860
I wasn't expecting you.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.779
And I wasn't expecting you
to be such a dunce.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.741
I know what you did with that Dolly,

00:32.824 --> 00:35.243
letting her give you the old rub and tug
between the bars.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.328
I'm a man, Mildred.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.955
No, you're a little boy…

00:40.206 --> 00:44.044
whose actions risk ruining
everything we're working toward.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.759
Now eat your dinner.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.221
You're looking thinner by the day.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.856
What's gonna happen if you do get me out?

01:06.608 --> 01:07.942
What's life supposed to…

01:09.652 --> 01:10.904
…be like for me out there?

01:14.157 --> 01:15.283
We'll be together.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.911
And we'll be free.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.123
And you'll have a future again.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.504
What kind of future will I have
if I can't relate to people…

01:28.797 --> 01:33.760
and you won't let me experience
the warmth and the touch of a woman?

01:34.427 --> 01:36.888
You got yourself into this mess.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.849
I know that I fucked up, Mildred.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.813
But you know what happened to me
in that place.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.732
Because it happened to you, too.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.902
I want to be normal, Mildred.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.909
And couldn't it benefit me and us,
if you let me just…

01:59.077 --> 02:01.204
try and learn to love?

02:01.704 --> 02:04.791
You're not in love with that common nurse.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.710
You're not.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.259
I suppose…

02:15.093 --> 02:18.847
if you don't let me form a relationship
with a real woman…

02:21.099 --> 02:21.933
…well, then,

02:22.433 --> 02:24.060
you're going to have to suffice.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.565
Let me be very clear.

02:30.191 --> 02:33.319
I will <i>never</i> do that with you again.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.910
Well, then, it sounds like…

02:42.078 --> 02:43.580
you've made a decision.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.718
Edmund.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.658
Now, this is <i>hühnerleberpastete,</i>

04:43.741 --> 04:46.369
which is just a fancy German word
for pâté,

04:46.452 --> 04:49.914
but it absolutely cannot sit out,
all right?

04:53.001 --> 04:56.421
Please tell me you have a day trip
to San Diego and you'll be back.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.922
I'm leaving, Trevor.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.174
I have to.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.892
I know that you think
what I'm doing right now is harsh.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.603
And I know you can't see it.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.565
But this is a miracle.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.483
I'm giving you a new life.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.403
We don't have to keep living this lie,
and maybe…

05:25.116 --> 05:26.367
we can have real love.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.745
Trevor…

05:29.912 --> 05:31.164
can you imagine that?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.209
I will not let this happen!

05:36.502 --> 05:38.338
Hm. I will come after you.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.798
You and this Mildred,
if that's even her real name.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.384
-Please, I'm begging you.
- Trevor, listen to me.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.971
If you don't move out of this doorway,
I'm gonna knock your block off.

05:52.769 --> 05:53.978
Please, Gwenny…

06:15.875 --> 06:17.543
<i>A single bed, or two?</i>

06:18.252 --> 06:19.253
Yes, that's fine.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.382
That was an either/or question.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.341
Oh.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.428
Maybe I'm asking you
whether you'll be alone

06:27.512 --> 06:32.767
or if someone else will be joining you,
Mrs. Briggs.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.436
Yes, I'm alone.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.687
But you're married.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.065
I just need to know which box to check.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.776
Is this the standard line of questioning
all your customers receive?

06:41.859 --> 06:43.861
As a matter of fact, it is.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.030
Huh. Oh.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.116
-Hi.
- Oh.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.077
So I see. You two know one another?

06:52.328 --> 06:53.538
What are you doing here?

06:53.621 --> 06:54.455
Checking in.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.876
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you…

06:59.836 --> 07:01.295
It's the only motel in town.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.257
I left my husband this morning.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.510
Separated.
I'll have to start over with a new form,

07:07.593 --> 07:09.429
because that is a different box.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.013
Give her her key, please.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.349
I just have to make a note.

07:13.808 --> 07:17.603
Open-ended stay.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.147
<i>You'll get used to it.</i>

07:20.022 --> 07:23.734
It's not like living in your own home,
to be sure, but it has its perks.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.288
He didn't hit you, did he?

07:35.371 --> 07:36.247
No.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.541
He's a wonderful man.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.877
But I couldn't live a lie anymore.

07:41.919 --> 07:46.716
I knew that it was time for me
to open myself up to something more.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.925
To experience…

07:50.678 --> 07:53.514
a true, full love.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.142
Oh…

08:05.109 --> 08:06.694
Ice machine's down the hall.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.697
I'm gonna be late for work.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.789
<i>It's so sad, isn't it?</i>

08:19.332 --> 08:21.751
<i>A boy that young in a place like this.</i>

08:21.834 --> 08:26.506
They say he daydreams, but, I mean,
what's so dangerous about an imagination?

08:27.048 --> 08:30.510
I suppose that depends
on the contents of that imagination.

08:34.430 --> 08:35.431
Do you daydream?

08:37.558 --> 08:39.268
Now what would I daydream about?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.812
You could consider masturbation
daydreaming.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.442
Do you masturbate, Dolly?

08:48.736 --> 08:50.404
You want to know if I masturbate?

08:50.488 --> 08:51.948
How often do you climax?

08:52.031 --> 08:53.658
-Is it every time?

08:53.741 --> 08:55.743
Can you not function
for the rest of the day

08:55.826 --> 08:58.162
if you can't reach
that moment of exultation?

08:58.246 --> 09:00.039
I really don't know
what you're getting at.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.832
I know what you did with Edmund.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.125
How do you know about that?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.002
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.796
Of course women have certain…

09:07.797 --> 09:09.966
erotic needs at times.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.597
I have to admit I've never met a woman
who viewed it like that.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.807
Hmm.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.850
My mother certainly did not.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.896
If I so much as looked at a boy…

09:25.106 --> 09:27.984
she'd give me ten lashes
and call me a whore.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.154
When you do masturbate,
do you think about Edmund?

09:33.364 --> 09:36.200
I've always been that way
when it comes to dangerous men.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.496
I suppose it started to spite my mother,

09:40.580 --> 09:44.542
but pretty soon I realized
that's all men viewed me for.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.336
And I liked it.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.798
And then I felt ashamed for liking it.

09:55.052 --> 09:58.347
You're a nymphomaniac, Dolly.
I researched it.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.517
You have insatiable sexual desires.

10:01.601 --> 10:05.438
Personally, I find it disgusting,
but you shouldn't feel ashamed.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.608
It's a mental illness for which
I'm afraid there is no cure.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.491
But I can arrange for you
to have relations with him.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.243
With who?

10:19.327 --> 10:20.745
With Edmund.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.624
I believe it could help his rehabilitation

10:25.291 --> 10:30.129
if he were given true human contact
and an occasional release.

10:32.882 --> 10:33.799
You're joking.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.676
You want to be a nurse, isn't that right?

10:35.760 --> 10:39.055
It is the duty of a nurse
to help her patient.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.768
If he were alone with me,
no bars between us…

10:44.518 --> 10:46.562
who's to say that he wouldn't kill me?

10:46.646 --> 10:47.647
Are you a priest?

10:47.730 --> 10:48.689
No.

10:48.773 --> 10:49.815
Well, then you're fine.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.734
Edmund Tolleson's crime was isolated,

10:51.817 --> 10:54.362
and it wasn't random,
and it wasn't against women.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.324
You still believe he's dangerous, right?

10:59.533 --> 11:00.618
Oh, yes.

11:00.701 --> 11:04.288
Who's to say he couldn't snap
at any moment?

11:08.292 --> 11:09.418
When would we do it?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.921
There's a lot of eyes in here.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.215
The only eyes that matter
are Nurse Bucket's.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.135
Your shift ends at 2:00
just as Nurse Bucket goes on lunch.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.764
Every day,
she sits in the exact same spot…

11:22.765 --> 11:25.518
and eats
the same exact ham and cheese sandwich

11:25.601 --> 11:26.560
while reading a book.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.855
This week it's <i>All the King's Men.</i>

11:30.773 --> 11:35.027
And she stays in that spot
until exactly 2:30.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.113
How are you gonna get him up here?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.073
The only thing
you need to concern yourself with

11:39.156 --> 11:42.201
is being in the tub room at exactly 2:05.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.578
I will handle Edmund.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.572
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

12:38.841 --> 12:39.800
Nurse Bucket,

12:39.884 --> 12:42.553
Mrs. Cartwright is complaining
that she lost her wedding ring

12:42.636 --> 12:44.388
during treatment in the tub room.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.098
She's throwing quite a tantrum.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.977
Suddenly she's concerned
about the symbols of matrimony.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.212
-Nurse Bucket?
-Nurse Bucket.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.339
We found it.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.134
Well, next time
try and be a little more thorough

13:22.218 --> 13:24.386
and not disturb me on my lunch break.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.689
It's 2:07. You have five minutes.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.275
Aren't you gonna uncuff him?

13:38.692 --> 13:39.610
Are you sure?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.029
Yes, take them off.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.055
You trust me with them off?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.308
No.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.811
But it excites me.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.993
You know, I could grab you by the throat

14:29.618 --> 14:32.204
and snap your pretty little neck
like a twig.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.501
But I don't want to do that.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.254
Not to you.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.047
What do you want to do to me?

14:44.592 --> 14:45.676
Not that, either.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.095
I just want to kiss you.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.475
It's been a long time
since I kissed a woman.

14:58.647 --> 14:59.940
Is that okay?

15:10.993 --> 15:11.827
Come in.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.332
Good afternoon, sir.
Betty said you wanted to see me.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.374
Yes, sit down.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.459
You seen this?

15:19.960 --> 15:24.173
Sixty-seven percent of all Californians
are now in favor of the death penalty.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.217
Three months ago, it was 46 percent.
Can you tell me why that's happened?

15:29.094 --> 15:30.846
-Edmund Tolleson.
-That's right.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.641
My people, my constituents…

15:34.391 --> 15:35.768
they want to see this man fry.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.854
So, is Dr. Hanover willing to play ball?

15:39.396 --> 15:40.356
Not yet, sir.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.901
The last couple of days,
he's become very difficult to track down.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.737
I need peace of mind.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.697
Our first primary's in less than a month.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.241
This Olsen guy most likely will be
our opponent in the election.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.577
I need him to know
that this state is still mine.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.122
I don't want him snooping around
telling people that I'm soft on crime!

15:57.206 --> 15:58.165
Is that understood?

15:58.248 --> 16:00.334
I'll make sure Dr. Hanover gets on board.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.769
Ingrid, it's time for your treatment.

16:24.984 --> 16:29.363
I already know what's going to happen
to me in there.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.616
I have spoken to Mrs. Cartwright,

16:32.700 --> 16:35.244
although it wasn't easy.

16:36.161 --> 16:39.456
She refuses to even look at me now.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.753
Sounds like the treatment
was a success, then.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.172
We can only hope the same for you.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.054
I want you to boil me.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.809
Boil me until there is nothing left

16:58.892 --> 17:04.898
but cooked meat so tender,
that it falls off my bones,

17:04.982 --> 17:08.152
and you can eat it with a spoon.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.198
Dr. Hanover is trying to help you.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.245
Don't you wish to rid yourself
of this disease?

17:19.246 --> 17:24.877
All my life I have been fighting
this thing inside of me.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.506
I couldn't tell anyone,
not even my doctors.

17:29.590 --> 17:33.093
Until finally, it drove me mad.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.222
I have pushed the true Ingrid down,

17:37.306 --> 17:40.434
but all the time I could feel her,

17:40.517 --> 17:45.189
digging her claws into my skin,

17:45.272 --> 17:47.941
begging to be let out.

17:48.025 --> 17:53.280
The way that Mrs. Cartwright devoured me

17:53.363 --> 17:55.115
leaves no room.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.160
She feels the same.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.500
You just…

18:05.167 --> 18:08.087
You don't know what it's like

18:08.962 --> 18:14.510
to be constantly running
from who you really are.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.565
Come on now, dry your tears.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.194
There will be no death today.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.426
This is a good day, Ingrid.

18:56.510 --> 19:01.265
The mania, the Sapphic predilections
that have so bedeviled your life,

19:01.348 --> 19:03.559
will soon be a thing of the past.

19:03.642 --> 19:07.271
And although he is
somewhat short in stature,

19:07.354 --> 19:09.773
Dr. Hanover is a giant in his field,

19:09.857 --> 19:12.609
and he only has your best interests
in mind.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.613
And provided we all do our jobs
and follow the instructions to the letter

19:16.697 --> 19:18.657
without any editorial comment,

19:18.740 --> 19:23.245
you will soon be a new, better woman.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.330
And that's a lovely thing, isn't it?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.125
Huck, prepare the tub.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.596
Something's wrong with it.
It's not kicking on.

19:44.892 --> 19:45.726
Move.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.071
Oh, for God's sake.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.120
Which one of you did this? Was it you?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.248
Or was it you, Miss Ratched,

20:08.832 --> 20:11.084
in yet another attempt
to undermine my authority?

20:11.168 --> 20:12.961
-It wasn't me.
-It's been a cold week.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.254
Rats are looking to keep warm.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.924
They could chew through a wire like that
with no problem.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.177
You know what, Huck? I think you're right.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.595
I think it was a rat.

20:21.678 --> 20:25.474
Oh, how I wish we could rid
this hospital of vermin.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.979
If I were you, I would choose
my next words very carefully.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.650
I-- I don't know how that cord
ended up like that,

20:34.733 --> 20:37.694
but I do know that I'm glad it happened,
because this is barbaric.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.488
Oh, really?

20:40.113 --> 20:43.367
Well, I wonder what Dr. Hanover will think
when he hears

20:43.450 --> 20:47.704
that his instructions have been
directly questioned by an orderly.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.415
I think it's clear
there will be no treatment today.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.502
I will take Ingrid back to her room

20:53.585 --> 20:56.797
before Nurse Bucket says something else
she might regret.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.842
Once Dr. Hanover learns
about your insubordination,

21:00.926 --> 21:02.386
you will be fired.

21:11.103 --> 21:11.937
Hello?

21:16.942 --> 21:18.652
Can I help you?!

21:22.072 --> 21:23.532
For the arthritis.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.868
Those yahoo doctors think I'm paying

21:26.952 --> 21:32.833
a whole 39 cents at the corner store
for some bullspit aspirin when I know…

21:33.959 --> 21:37.045
…leeches can serve the same purpose.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.006
Any messages for room 8?

21:40.716 --> 21:42.509
You had a phone call.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.387
She didn't leave her name,
but she said it was urgent.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.305
Anything else?

21:46.763 --> 21:48.307
From your pen pal…

21:49.891 --> 21:50.892
in room 10.

21:55.564 --> 21:59.901
So, what is it you and Miss Ratched
have going on?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.278
That's our business.

22:01.361 --> 22:04.156
Everything that happens here
is my business,

22:04.239 --> 22:06.950
and I'll tell you the same thing
that I told her.

22:07.034 --> 22:10.746
I don't tolerate fornication in my motel,

22:10.829 --> 22:13.540
especially when it's out of wedlock!

22:21.423 --> 22:22.341
I need the phone.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.309
And a minute of privacy.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.412
Queen to rook five.

22:55.332 --> 22:59.503
I said queen to rook five.
That is clearly not rook five.

22:59.586 --> 23:00.670
<i>Lo siento,</i> Mr. Henry.

23:00.754 --> 23:04.257
I swear, Mother, it's as if
you hire nothing but imbeciles these days!

23:04.341 --> 23:07.010
Settle down and plot your next move.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.640
It's important to always stay ahead
of your opponent.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.811
Miss Lenore,
Mr. Wainwright on the phone for you.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.270
-Oh.

23:17.813 --> 23:18.647
Now…

23:19.481 --> 23:21.858
I don't want to come back
and see you smoking.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.823
Remember to keep him
behind your wing pawns.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.491
Yes, I know how to play, Mother.

23:31.910 --> 23:32.786
Tell me.

23:34.287 --> 23:39.626
Tell me what his eyes looked like
when you began to sever his larynx.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.963
He's being a little more elusive
than anticipated,

23:43.046 --> 23:44.464
but it shouldn't be too much longer.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.967
There's only so many places
he can hide in a town this small.

23:47.050 --> 23:50.262
Beginning tomorrow,
every day that I don't have his head,

23:50.345 --> 23:53.348
<i>you will lose $50,000 from your fee.</i>

23:53.432 --> 23:58.603
So I suggest that you get it together
and do your goddamn job.

24:32.095 --> 24:33.221
-Sit.
-I thought I told you

24:33.305 --> 24:36.766
-you were the worst lay of my life.
-And I thought I told you to sit.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.943
I know what your cat-and-mouse game is.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.071
You're after Dr. Hanover.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.492
How do you know who he is?

24:53.575 --> 24:56.036
Dr. Hanover? He's my boss.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.456
How many Filipinos do you think there are
in this town?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.417
This isn't San Francisco.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.089
I bet he didn't come home, did he?

25:09.382 --> 25:12.219
Why do I get the sense
that you know where he might be?

25:17.015 --> 25:18.642
I know lots of things.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.187
Which is lucky for you.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.484
Because despite your insensitive
and wildly inaccurate statement

25:27.567 --> 25:29.277
about my ability to pleasure…

25:31.530 --> 25:32.948
I still wanna help you.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.451
I gotta be honest, I'm not liking

25:36.535 --> 25:39.829
the prospect of working with a woman
who's willing to give up a man so easy.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.998
Who's to say you won't do the same to me?

25:45.794 --> 25:50.131
Any man who would be responsible
for the parole of a brute,

25:50.215 --> 25:55.220
who murdered four priests in cold blood,
would never be worthy of my loyalty.

26:03.478 --> 26:06.106
Dr. Hanover must be stopped at any cost.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.941
Are you interested in my help?

26:08.441 --> 26:09.693
-Your help?
-Yes.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.612
My help.

26:16.908 --> 26:17.742
Maybe.

26:26.459 --> 26:27.335
Poor baby.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.424
First you lose your legs,

26:32.507 --> 26:36.386
and then they tell you
the morphine won't arrive until morning.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.848
-I know how much pain you're in.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.975
Is there anything I can do

26:42.058 --> 26:44.519
to make your transition to death
more pleasurable?

26:44.811 --> 26:46.396
I think you know what you can do.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.072
This is the type of lay you want,
isn't it?

26:57.949 --> 26:59.242
Then take it back.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.830
Take back that I am the worst lay
of your life.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.207
Prove me otherwise, Mildred.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.147
Go back to your room and wash yourself.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.025
I will make the call to Dr. Hanover,
and I can assure you

27:32.108 --> 27:33.943
he will be at the hospital
within the hour.

27:34.027 --> 27:37.113
-How can you know for sure?
-Because that hospital is his life.

27:37.197 --> 27:40.700
And I'm one of his most trusted nurses,
so if I tell him there's a problem,

27:40.784 --> 27:41.743
he will show up.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.642
-What are you doing?
-May I come in?

28:05.725 --> 28:06.685
No, you may not.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.190
Two women enter a room together,
and some may get the wrong idea.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.692
You wouldn't want that, would you?

28:13.775 --> 28:14.859
No, I wouldn't.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.028
Who's that man?

28:19.739 --> 28:21.908
My personal relationships
are none of your business.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.284
Oh, is that what it is?

28:24.285 --> 28:25.495
A relationship?

28:25.578 --> 28:28.039
Did you have a particular reason
for knocking on my door?

28:28.123 --> 28:28.957
Yes.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.625
Well, what is it?

28:33.545 --> 28:38.216
Edmund Tolleson… needs to be deemed fit
to stand trial.

28:39.676 --> 28:43.012
If not, Governor Wilburn
will defund the hospital.

28:43.096 --> 28:46.599
He isn't someone who appreciates
his requests being ignored.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.104
I will give your message to Dr. Hanover.

28:53.022 --> 28:55.400
But I'm afraid
that's all I can do for you.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.111
His office is on the second floor.

30:22.695 --> 30:23.863
I'll bring him to you.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.578
Good evening, Agnes.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.580
Would you mind checking
the lost and found drawer?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.082
I seem to have misplaced my compact.

30:43.883 --> 30:45.677
No, there's nothing there.

30:46.302 --> 30:48.847
I must have left it
in the break room, then. Thank you.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.016
I need to talk to you.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.270
Bucket fixed the tub.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.647
Ingrid's scheduled
for 8:30 tomorrow morning.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.444
Then we deal with this tonight.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.030
Get Mrs. Cartwright.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.086
Excuse me.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.170
Excuse me.

33:45.648 --> 33:46.524
Help me lift him.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.741
Hello. I'm Gwendolyn Briggs,

33:54.824 --> 33:56.868
I'm the press secretary
for Governor Wilburn.

33:56.951 --> 33:58.286
Where are you taking that patient?

33:58.369 --> 34:00.204
-She's not a patient.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.377
Dr. Hanover, I wasn't aware you were here.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.172
-Who's this?
-Boilerplate schizophrenic,

34:09.255 --> 34:10.465
just got dropped off.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.467
I'm taking him to a treatment before bed.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.458
How high are you going?

34:45.917 --> 34:47.418
A hundred and fifty degrees.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.089
What?

34:56.552 --> 34:57.553
Where am I?

35:06.562 --> 35:08.106
This won't solve anything!

35:08.815 --> 35:10.608
She'll keep looking for you!

35:11.609 --> 35:12.443
Hey!

35:28.876 --> 35:31.546
Go back to your office
and clean up your mess.

35:52.859 --> 35:53.776
Wake up.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.403
Wake up.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.238
We're leaving.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.740
-Let's go.

35:59.824 --> 36:00.700
Come on.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.663
Dr. Hanover?

36:13.754 --> 36:14.630
Help!

36:21.053 --> 36:23.890
Help! Help!

36:26.559 --> 36:27.393
Hey.

36:28.102 --> 36:28.936
Hey!

36:36.235 --> 36:37.862
It's back to bed, all right?

36:37.945 --> 36:39.447
I just wanted a glass of milk.

36:39.989 --> 36:40.865
Come on.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.294
Dr. Hanover?

36:56.547 --> 36:57.673
Dr. Hanover?

37:17.151 --> 37:18.361
What are you doing in here?

37:25.743 --> 37:28.329
I've been trying to reach you.
You're a hard man to track down.

37:37.463 --> 37:38.589
Run. Run!

37:54.397 --> 37:55.314
Mildred!

37:57.400 --> 37:58.985
Come. Come.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.572
What's happening?

38:05.241 --> 38:06.742
Petty cash I took from Bucket's office.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.287
Use it to put them
on whichever train is going farthest.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.580
Why are you doing this?

38:12.957 --> 38:14.542
You said I didn't understand.

38:16.877 --> 38:17.753
But I do.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.494
What's this blood, Doctor?

40:01.690 --> 40:02.566
Excuse me.

40:04.610 --> 40:05.694
What in the hell?

40:06.862 --> 40:08.030
Peter, get back to your room.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.740
Get to your room, now!

40:18.874 --> 40:19.959
It isn't real.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.586
It's all in my imagination.

40:23.170 --> 40:27.383
It's very important to the governor that
Tolleson be declared fit to stand trial.

40:28.092 --> 40:31.095
Very, very important.

40:31.178 --> 40:33.222
Peter. Peter, get out of the way!

40:37.935 --> 40:39.061
Stop or I'll shoot!

40:44.525 --> 40:45.359
Miss Briggs.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.194
What seems to be the problem?

41:09.091 --> 41:09.967
Harold!

41:10.050 --> 41:11.218
I told him to stop!

41:11.552 --> 41:12.470
Oh, my God!

41:13.179 --> 41:15.222
But he… he didn't stop.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.641
- Harold, how--
- Is he dead? Oh, my God.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.727
Please, Harold,
get Peter back to his room.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.770
Wait, wait,
shouldn't there be authorities

41:21.854 --> 41:23.647
that may want to talk to me, or…

41:23.731 --> 41:25.065
-Harold!
- I just shot a…

41:25.149 --> 41:27.818
Take Peter back to his room,
and take the rest of the night off.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.695
Anything we need from you,
we'll let you know.

41:29.778 --> 41:31.071
-Yes, sir.
- Go on.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.991
Oh, my God, what happened to him?

41:34.074 --> 41:37.536
We took him for a warm bath
to calm him before bed, but we left him.

41:37.953 --> 41:40.581
You left him?
Wasn't that negligent on your part?

41:40.664 --> 41:42.708
Once we learned there was
an intruder in the hospital,

41:42.791 --> 41:44.418
we had to take into consideration

41:44.502 --> 41:46.587
-the safety of all patients.
-What do you mean, intruder?

41:46.670 --> 41:48.047
You, Miss Briggs.

41:48.130 --> 41:51.050
When we left him,
he was locked securely in the tub.

41:51.133 --> 41:53.052
He must have turned
the temperature up on his own.

41:53.135 --> 41:54.303
He was locked in the tub?

41:54.386 --> 41:57.348
He's a schizophrenic, Miss Briggs.
It's a standard procedure.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.100
I'll call the proper authorities
and notify his family.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.977
I'll speak to the police
when they arrive.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.312
I don't think that's a good idea.

42:03.395 --> 42:06.440
Well, I happen to think
it's not only a good idea, it's necessary,

42:06.524 --> 42:09.109
considering the effect this could have
on the governor's reelection.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.403
Imagine the effect it could have
if it got out

42:11.487 --> 42:14.949
that the governor's press secretary
played a part in this man's death.

42:15.032 --> 42:17.117
-I played--
-However accidental.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.164
Don't you agree, Dr. Hanover?

42:23.249 --> 42:24.083
Yes.

42:24.625 --> 42:27.378
Miss Briggs, we're only looking out
for your well-being.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.992

Two women in the same car?

43:53.964 --> 43:56.467
Aren't you worried
about people getting the wrong impression?

43:57.301 --> 43:59.094
I know what you saw upset you.

44:01.263 --> 44:03.307
Sarcasm won't change that.

44:07.811 --> 44:09.146
He didn't even look human.

44:09.647 --> 44:10.939
He wasn't human.

44:12.983 --> 44:16.070
The man that God intended him to be
was long gone…

44:16.904 --> 44:18.947
before he arrived on our doorstep.

44:25.996 --> 44:28.666
Will you be telling Governor Wilburn
what happened?

44:31.543 --> 44:33.337
Is that why you've joined me here?

44:34.213 --> 44:35.631
To try to persuade me otherwise?

44:35.714 --> 44:36.590
No.

44:38.801 --> 44:41.720
I'm here because
you seem genuinely shaken.

44:43.305 --> 44:45.683
And I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

44:45.766 --> 44:48.352
If you did want to talk
about what happened,

44:48.435 --> 44:50.646
I think it would be best
to take some time…

44:51.438 --> 44:54.066
until we've both had
a chance to absorb it.

44:57.486 --> 44:58.779
And in the meantime…

45:01.240 --> 45:03.826
perhaps we could go
to that restaurant again.

45:03.909 --> 45:05.828
The charming one near the ocean.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.664
You want to have dinner with me?

45:10.666 --> 45:11.542
This weekend?

45:14.878 --> 45:16.505
It'll be a celebration.

45:16.588 --> 45:17.965
A celebration of death?

45:18.048 --> 45:19.508
No, of life.

45:20.843 --> 45:23.846
The life you can have
now that you've left your husband.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.933
Your courage inspires me.

45:30.436 --> 45:31.645
This weekend, then?

46:48.305 --> 46:49.473
Phone call, Miss Lenore.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.851
Do I look like I'm available
to take a phone call, Doris?

46:52.935 --> 46:56.563
They say it's Mr. Wainwright,
but it sounds like a woman.

46:57.898 --> 46:58.774
Ooh.

47:06.615 --> 47:07.991
Is he dead, Charles?

47:08.075 --> 47:10.577
<i>There's something poetic</i>

47:10.661 --> 47:12.704

47:16.750 --> 47:18.001
<i>like Charles Wainwright.</i>

47:18.335 --> 47:19.294
Who is this?

47:20.254 --> 47:21.255
Mildred Ratched.

47:22.965 --> 47:25.092
I've decided to always be honest with you.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.511
I don't know who you are,

47:27.594 --> 47:30.806
or whether you've intentionally
inserted yourself into my affairs

47:30.889 --> 47:33.475
or whether it was by pure accident.

47:34.268 --> 47:37.354
But allow me to warn you
that you have found yourself

47:37.437 --> 47:39.815
in the most unenviable of positions.

47:39.898 --> 47:42.025
Oh, I beg to differ.

47:43.235 --> 47:45.779
I believe it's that bumbling hit man
of yours

47:45.863 --> 47:47.990
who's in the most unenviable of positions.

47:49.074 --> 47:50.450
Seeing as how he's…

47:51.368 --> 47:52.286
you know…

47:53.287 --> 47:54.121
dead.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.042
Hello?

48:00.836 --> 48:01.712
Hello?

48:02.671 --> 48:03.505
<i>Hello?</i>

48:05.257 --> 48:06.091
Well.

48:06.174 --> 48:08.051
<i>I've been considering a vacation.</i>

48:08.135 --> 48:09.720
<i>Might you have a suggestion?</i>

48:10.262 --> 48:13.724
Well, I must say
it's been quite beautiful here.

48:14.808 --> 48:18.854
Unseasonably warm, and the freshest air
I've ever experienced.

48:18.937 --> 48:21.648
<i>There's a charming motel</i>
<i>called the Sealight Inn,</i>

48:21.732 --> 48:24.151
<i>run by the sweetest old jazz baby</i>
<i>you'll ever meet.</i>

48:24.234 --> 48:25.652
And you're in luck.

48:26.528 --> 48:28.363
A room just became available.

48:28.447 --> 48:31.116
Well, then, Lucia it is.

48:31.199 --> 48:33.827
<i>You'll be seeing me very soon,</i>
<i>Miss Ratched.</i>

48:33.911 --> 48:34.745
I'm looking forward--

48:52.930 --> 48:55.933
But I don't understand
how somebody just disappears.

48:56.016 --> 48:58.060
Are you gonna find her?
Have you called the police?

48:58.143 --> 48:59.853
Mr. Cartwright,
I assure you…

48:59.937 --> 49:02.189
-He doesn't seem happy.
-…the police have been notified.

49:02.272 --> 49:04.066
-You wouldn't either…

49:04.566 --> 49:07.444
…if your wife wanted to be in the arms
of another woman so badly,

49:07.527 --> 49:10.322
she risked her life escaping
and was nowhere to be found.

49:11.657 --> 49:12.783
Are they safe?

49:13.909 --> 49:15.827
I got them on the train, no issue.

49:19.581 --> 49:22.334
Bucket's going to flip her lid
when she gets in.

49:22.584 --> 49:23.961
Oh, rest assured…

49:25.253 --> 49:27.381
I've got plans for Betsy Bucket.

49:29.049 --> 49:29.883
You're an angel.

49:31.593 --> 49:33.053
What you did for those women.

49:36.723 --> 49:37.724
Mildred Ratched…

49:39.643 --> 49:40.894
you're an angel of mercy.

49:43.730 --> 49:44.815
Thank you, Huck.

49:47.025 --> 49:48.485
I've never heard that before.

49:56.326 --> 49:58.578
<i>Please, give me the morphine.</i>

49:58.662 --> 50:00.205
I can't take this pain.

50:00.288 --> 50:02.708
-There are no more drugs.

50:02.791 --> 50:04.918
Not until the supply chain arrives
in the morning.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.255
<i>Is there anything I can do</i>
<i>to make you more comfortable?</i>

50:08.338 --> 50:09.214
Yes.

50:09.673 --> 50:10.507
Tell me.

50:11.466 --> 50:12.384
Kill me.

50:13.552 --> 50:14.386
Please.

50:15.971 --> 50:17.305
I can't do that.

50:20.225 --> 50:21.059
Fuck!

50:24.604 --> 50:26.064
<i>Do you believe in angels?</i>

50:26.148 --> 50:29.609
My mother always believed
each of us had angels.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.821
But they only appear when death is near,

50:32.904 --> 50:35.866
to help be a comfort to us as we pass.

50:37.159 --> 50:38.577
I think I see one.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.457
I think I see angels.

51:17.282 --> 51:18.867
<i>You're an angel of mercy.</i>
