00:04.771 --> 00:06.672
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.674 --> 00:11.143
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:12.711
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.713 --> 00:15.347
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:18.150
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:20.185
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:23.088
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:25.024
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.026 --> 00:26.625
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.028
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.330
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:33.532
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:35.801
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.803 --> 00:38.604
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.606 --> 00:40.539
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:43.108
(panting)

00:55.688 --> 00:57.689
Did you hear that?

00:57.691 --> 00:59.391
Nothing to hear,
octavio.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.561
Transport isn't due for an hour.
Settle down.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.396
(speaks spanish)

01:04.398 --> 01:07.099
You haven't seen what they do
to people like me.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.068
Two years we've been working
to take down the cartel.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.536
We've seen plenty.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.137
I swear I hear something.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.473
There's no place more secure

01:14.475 --> 01:17.776
Than this middle-of-nowhere
desert dump, octavio.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.547
Guaranteed by
the u.S. Government.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.449
We are alone.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.150
(two gunshots)

01:28.688 --> 01:30.355
(gunshot)

01:46.439 --> 01:48.507
Ralph?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.780
It's 2:00 in
the morning.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.617
And you're supposed to ask
to use my laptop, buddy.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.652
My game got weird.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.754
I unlocked a hidden level.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.224
It took me someplace.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.892
But there was no one there.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.194
What game is this?
A new one.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.230
Online.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.499
You know we don't play games
I don't approve of first.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.234
Right? Sleep.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.535
Now.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.744
(truck beeping)

02:30.150 --> 02:31.683
You're late.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.286
You don't speed when you're
hauling this kind of load.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.221
Got to ask, is this
thing radioactive?

02:36.223 --> 02:37.890
Shouldn't be.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.495
â™ª

03:01.481 --> 03:03.649
Hey, go grab that shadow
box for your show-and-tell.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.317
I'll make you a quick
breakfast. Five minutes.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.753
What's walter working on?
I don't know.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.892
What's that?

03:13.894 --> 03:15.961
It's a booster
decoupler.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.429
For what?

03:18.731 --> 03:19.898
Ralph:
Wow!

03:19.900 --> 03:21.400
"wow" what?

03:21.402 --> 03:23.402
What's he up to?

03:23.404 --> 03:25.270
No idea.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.973
So...

03:27.975 --> 03:29.508
What are we doing?

03:29.510 --> 03:30.876
Ah-ah! Reactor core.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.512
Please do not
touch that.

03:33.514 --> 03:37.216
Am I looking at
a dismantled cl-450?

03:37.218 --> 03:39.585
It's a cl-460.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.752
Polish this for me?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.955
Oh, she can polish
the reactor core,

03:42.957 --> 03:44.389
I'm lord numbnuts.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.391
You're no good
with your hands.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.759
You're a spiller.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.461
Am I?

03:49.463 --> 03:51.463
(loud clattering)

03:51.465 --> 03:52.531
Toby!

03:52.533 --> 03:53.532
Yeah, numbnuts,
yeah, mm-hmm.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.866
Whoa.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.469
Why don't you go do
a psych eval on the coffee pot?

03:58.972 --> 04:00.305
Where is the olds?

04:00.307 --> 04:02.307
I was gonna use that
as a make-out hut.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.343
With who?
A lucky lady.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.681
Whoa, walter!

04:09.683 --> 04:11.316
What is this?
You're building a spaceship?

04:11.318 --> 04:12.284
Hold on, hold on.

04:12.286 --> 04:15.020
I'm studying
jet propulsion.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.688
For the karman line prize.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.323
It was announced
last week.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.994
An anonymous billionaire
is awarding $15 million

04:21.996 --> 04:24.329
For significant aerospace
advancement.

04:24.331 --> 04:27.366
Just imagine what I could do
for megan's ms for $15 million.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.471
Hey, walt, can I get a sec?

04:36.976 --> 04:38.910
There's a lot of ways
to make money.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.479
That much at once?

04:40.481 --> 04:41.813
It's a short list.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.682
And I don't have
an oil well.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.550
Whoa, a rocket.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.052
When we're done
with the reactor core,

04:47.054 --> 04:48.887
Can we repair the control drum?

04:48.889 --> 04:51.890
We probably need to get the
rust off the turbo pumps.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.392
Maybe a vinegar bath.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.727
I should skip school
until this is done.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.928
Nope. We're leaving.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.430
Now. In the car.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.503
You sure this is about megan?

05:04.505 --> 05:05.804
'cause ralph is
certainly hooked.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.906
You're reaching for something.
What?

05:07.908 --> 05:11.877
Just pretty cool project,
building a rocket ship.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.745
What little boy
doesn't dream of that?

05:18.385 --> 05:20.986
He's gonna pick you
up after school

05:20.988 --> 05:22.454
And take you
for a milkshake.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.555
I'd rather work
on the rocket.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.956
Well, he's looking
forward to it.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.658
He said he
got you a hat.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.661
But I'd rather work
on the rocket.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.830
The plans are set.
No more tug-of-war.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.931
Come on.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.534
(tires screeching)

05:37.470 --> 05:39.438
Ralph, come here.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.439
Paige dineen.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.407
Agent wilson eckherd,

05:42.409 --> 05:44.009
Department of justice.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.011
This is ralph?
What do you want?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.380
You need to come with us,
both of you.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.781
It concerns
national security.

05:49.783 --> 05:50.949
What did I do?

05:50.951 --> 05:53.485
It's not you, ma'am,
it's your son.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.020
Let's go, come on.
Uh, okay.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.556
Hold on.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.394
Mom, am I
going to jail?

06:02.396 --> 06:04.429
Of course not.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.431
I am sure it's a mix-up.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.532
Miss dineen.

06:09.402 --> 06:10.802
I'm not leaving my son alone.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.405
My office is right
on the other side of that glass.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.606
And you don't really
have a choice.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.410
I'll be right in there.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.479
Okay.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.153
What the hell is going on?

06:30.957 --> 06:33.558
Oh, my god.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.428
Agents daniel cullens and kate
stellan were killed last night

06:36.430 --> 06:38.964
In a cia safe house
in culiacan, mexico.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.632
They were guarding
a turncoat captain

06:40.634 --> 06:42.134
In the jotas
drug cartel.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.503
What does this
have to do with ralph?

06:44.505 --> 06:47.539
The location and layout of
the safe house were leaked

06:47.541 --> 06:49.674
As a secret level of
a game posted online.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.843
Again, how does this
concern ralph?

06:51.845 --> 06:54.012
Thousands of people
played this game,

06:54.014 --> 06:56.548
But only two parties found
the secret level

06:56.550 --> 06:58.850
And decrypted
the safe house information--

06:58.852 --> 07:01.019
The drug cartel who murdered
our agents and ralph.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.423
So it's something
he stumbled on.

07:04.425 --> 07:07.559
Ralph was in a map ten
encryptions deep into this game,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.895
Something that would take a good
hacker months to accomplish.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.430
He couldn't have
just stumbled on it.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.966
The safe house information
was classified cia intel.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.069
Our concern is that ralph may
have helped design the game

07:18.071 --> 07:21.773
How on earth would he have
access to cia intelligence?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.942
You work for a
government contractor.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.445
Your team has specialized
expert hackers.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.447
None of them would
allow him to do this.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.449
Scorpion does nothing
but help people.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.117
Miss dineen, we don't
grab children randomly

07:32.119 --> 07:36.054
Either he knew where the secret
map was and how to access it,

07:36.056 --> 07:38.690
Or had something to do with
the design of this game.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.993
Which disseminated
cia intelligence, okay.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.229
This is a very,
very serious situation.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.231
I need to speak
with ralph.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.000
You can be watching
from right next door.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.969
I need to speak
with walter o'brien

07:50.971 --> 07:53.038
And agent cabe gallo
from homeland.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.911
This is your mom's
laptop, ralph.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.916
That game you were
playing, <i>overt target,</i>

08:04.918 --> 08:06.885
Where did you find it?

08:06.887 --> 08:09.020
Playing around.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.022
You know what
a dark web site is?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.959
They're inaccessible
to normal search engines.

08:13.961 --> 08:17.662
You don't just play around
and find them.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.865
And <i>overt target</i>
<i>was in the dark web.</i>

08:21.834 --> 08:24.836
I know you're
a-a smart boy.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.004
Genius.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.975
When my forensic team goes
through your mom's computer,

08:29.977 --> 08:31.510
They're gonna
find everything--

08:31.512 --> 08:33.712
Every game you played,
how you got there,

08:33.714 --> 08:35.146
Who you chatted with.

08:38.084 --> 08:40.652
How did you find the secret
level, the safe house level?

08:40.654 --> 08:42.187
I just found it.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.922
No. No, that's
impossible.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.859
Did you have anything to do
with the design of this game?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.160
No.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.596
Do you know who
created the game?

08:51.598 --> 08:54.933
How did you find the dark site
where it was posted?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.201
And do not tell me

08:56.203 --> 08:57.869
That you just found it.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.772
Walter showed it to me.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.941
Eckherd:
Walter?

09:02.943 --> 09:05.844
Walter o'brien?

09:07.179 --> 09:10.048
And he taught me decryption.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.850
I didn't know it was bad.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.218
This is over now.

09:15.187 --> 09:18.023
Cabe: Agent gallo,
homeland security.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.225
What did you teach him?

09:28.134 --> 09:30.035
Walter:
So these dark sites,

09:30.037 --> 09:32.971
It's where the most interesting
coding is; it-it's cutting edge.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.141
I thought it would be
interesting for ralph to see

09:36.143 --> 09:38.043
Where the smartest people
on the web are designing.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.644
And doing what else?

09:39.646 --> 09:41.046
Did you think of that?

09:41.048 --> 09:44.349
I was just showing him
a beta game site.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.351
People post for feedback
to drum up buzz

09:46.353 --> 09:50.155
You get to see the game
years before anyone else does.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.656
Stop. Now.

09:51.658 --> 09:54.092
Drew: Got here as
quick as I could.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.595
Hey, buddy.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.896
Scary day, huh?

09:59.098 --> 10:00.332
Somebody want to fill me in?

10:00.334 --> 10:01.967
It's nothing, he did nothing.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.802
But he got hauled
off the street

10:03.804 --> 10:06.004
In front of his school, and
we're at the justice department.

10:06.806 --> 10:09.007
Can you sit with ralph?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.275
Yeah.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.879
Hey.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.349
You want to tell me
what happened?

10:17.351 --> 10:19.618
I just want to
talk to walter.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.021
Okay.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.990
(clears throat)

10:24.992 --> 10:28.259
Eckherd's not buying him just
stumbling into the secret level.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.261
That is the likely scenario.
He just can't comprehend

10:30.263 --> 10:32.263
The depth of ralph's
intelligence; maybe no one can.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.633
They should be talking
to walter. Why aren't they?

10:34.635 --> 10:36.101
I can explain everything.
Not now.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.769
I've lawyered up
for the whole team.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.404
In the meantime, ralph's being
released back to you.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.072
Thank god.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.274
But he's my responsibility, so
you need to stay close to me

10:43.276 --> 10:45.110
In case eckherd wants
him to come back in.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.912
Cabe, let me talk to them
and clear this up.

10:47.914 --> 10:51.349
The safe house intel in the
game was stolen in a hack

10:51.351 --> 10:53.852
Of the cia mainframe
three weeks ago.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.954
Details from six other
unknown operations

10:55.956 --> 10:57.789
And safe houses
were taken.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.225
Ralph had nothing to do
with hacking the cia.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.960
I know.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.363
Okay, so we need to find out
who hacked the cia.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.232
That's who likely put
the information in the game.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.366
Why are we standing here?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.901
Hey.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.936
Fill me in.

11:11.938 --> 11:12.937
There's no time.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.739
He's my son. Make time.

11:14.741 --> 11:18.910
You know, with your history,
I would be cautious saying that.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.312
This is not
about either of you.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.114
This is a mess you got
ralph into, and you need

11:23.116 --> 11:24.416
To get him out. Do
you understand that?

11:24.418 --> 11:26.451
I will make this right.
Stop talking

11:26.453 --> 11:27.786
And just do it.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.738
Where are we?

11:46.740 --> 11:47.806
Walter, are you okay?
Where's ralph?

11:47.808 --> 11:50.408
Coming with
cabe, paige and drew.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.910
What's our progress
tracking the developer

11:51.912 --> 11:54.079
Of the <i>overt target</i> game?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.081
We're into it,
but on the deep web,

11:56.083 --> 11:58.016
Multiple shifting identities
are the norm.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.885
Whoever designed this game
is using an anonymous proxy,

12:00.887 --> 12:02.721
Which means any traceback
will be tor'd

12:02.723 --> 12:05.757
How is narrating our process
helping our speed?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.927
Walter?

12:11.897 --> 12:14.733
The cia and the
justice department,

12:14.735 --> 12:16.501
They're certainly working
to find this game designer

12:16.503 --> 12:19.270
And coming up blank,
meaning this may take a minute.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.939
They're not us.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.108
And anything that ralph
was doing on paige's laptop

12:23.110 --> 12:24.843
Will be backed up
to our cloud server.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.177
We know.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.047
We're already
tracking his steps.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.216
I only showed him
the deep web because

12:31.218 --> 12:33.451
It's where he could find people
like himself, people like us.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.286
I'm certain your
intentions were good.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.956
He was engaged,
he was asking questions.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.459
It was like the first time
that I used the internet.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.794
We were just having fun.

12:45.531 --> 12:48.066
You're reading my body language
and analyzing me.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.834
I was absolutely
doing that.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.104
I'm determining
whether you know

12:53.106 --> 12:55.540
That mentoring a young person
is about more than just fun.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.475
Of course I know that.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.782
Happy: Hey, ralph,
how's it going, pal?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.550
Sylvester: Heard you
held up like a champ.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.786
Better than my first arrest.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.056
That was inappropriate.

13:12.491 --> 13:13.792
Use the loft.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.568
Back to work.
Walter.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.136
I may have found
the game designer

13:25.138 --> 13:26.304
Buried beneath seven layers
of encryption

13:26.306 --> 13:28.873
On the <i>overt target</i>
<i>message board.</i>

13:28.875 --> 13:30.341
Took me, like,
15 minutes to crack.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.443
An eternity.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.312
There's something
you need to see.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.314
Get a little rest.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.415
I'll be downstairs.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.018
If you need me,
tell drew.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.387
Look, um...

13:42.389 --> 13:45.390
I can handle what walter said
earlier, and I accept it,

13:45.392 --> 13:47.859
But this situation, his
exposure to the team...

13:47.861 --> 13:49.527
You don't see
the amazing things they do.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.995
They're brilliant.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.997
They're adults,
in an adult world.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.933
You don't know them like I do.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.234
They would never hurt ralph.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.435
And yet, here we are.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.971
Look, I don't have
any right to push you.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.306
But his internet usage...

14:01.308 --> 14:02.907
Oh, he's never playing
that game again.

14:02.909 --> 14:05.076
All his internet
will be monitored.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.846
Good. So we're on
the same page.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.848
I appreciate you being paternal.

14:09.850 --> 14:13.184
Walter is ralph's friend
and a huge asset,

14:13.186 --> 14:16.287
But this was not
his finest moment.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.891
We're trying to give
ralph some time to rest.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.193
It's important.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.895
Hey, ralph.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.597
Hey, buddy.

14:25.599 --> 14:28.600
In the <i>overt target</i> chat room,
did you ever communicate

14:28.602 --> 14:30.535
With someone called
"minidanger"?

14:33.005 --> 14:35.406
Son, just tell us what
you talked about, that's all.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.443
I just said the level one entry

14:38.445 --> 14:41.446
Into the abandoned warehouse
was too easy to find.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.281
There should be
a hidden entrance.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.949
And he responded to you?

14:44.951 --> 14:47.485
He said, "okay."
and then what happened?

14:47.487 --> 14:50.889
He changed the game.

14:52.658 --> 14:56.227
I assume it's bad he was
talking to the game designer?

14:56.229 --> 14:59.063
Ralph made a suggestion
that helped modify the game.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.065
Do you know how that's
gonna look to eckherd

15:01.067 --> 15:03.101
When he finds out?
Ralph did nothing wrong.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.168
Cabe:
He was asked if he helped

15:04.170 --> 15:06.170
Design the game, ralph said no.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.172
But we have proof
that he did help.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.041
Unknowingly.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.011
American agents were killed
as a result of this game.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.545
And the cia has been

15:14.547 --> 15:17.015
Searching like hell
for the culprits.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.218
If need be, they may just
make an example out of ralph.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.552
They'll cut his computer use,

15:21.554 --> 15:24.055
Put him on a no-fly list
for the rest of his life.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.424
He may never get a job
beyond flipping burgers.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.959
Happy: Basically,
everything that would've

15:27.961 --> 15:30.695
Happened to walt
if cabe hadn't shown up.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.196
So now we need to locate
the game designer,

15:32.198 --> 15:33.431
Minidanger.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.199
He's the only one
that can confirm

15:35.201 --> 15:36.935
That ralph's game suggestions
were innocent.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.937
Guys, I'm actually communicating

15:38.939 --> 15:41.472
With minidanger right now
in another chat room.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.041
He just responded to you?

15:43.043 --> 15:44.275
I called him
a "no talent,

15:44.277 --> 15:46.110
Dimwit, fart
of a game designer."

15:46.112 --> 15:48.112
I said his work reminded me
of something

15:48.114 --> 15:50.081
A dog might deliver
after eating old cheese.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.149
What are you talking about?

15:51.151 --> 15:54.452
It runs rampant with artists,
writers and game designers.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.454
Especially the latter,

15:56.456 --> 15:59.290
Who grew up maligned by jocks
and ignored by cheerleaders.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.159
Like us?
Toby: Yeah, so
now these guys

16:01.161 --> 16:02.727
Have this muscle to flex.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.128
And these chat rooms?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.130
Just a constant joystick
measuring contest.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.466
Best way to get a response
is with insults.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.235
Admittedly, it's a shot
in the dark, but he responded.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.704
From a mobile device?

16:12.706 --> 16:14.505
Which can be traced.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.707
Keep insulting him.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.475
Keep him responding.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.010
Happy, you'll trace
from the suv.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.511
Okay, guys, let's go!

16:24.717 --> 16:26.751
Of course he's here.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.619
Three times
I've called minidanger

16:28.621 --> 16:30.655
An undescended cat gonad,
still no response.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.690
The last communication came
from inside the building.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.192
Oh, and, cabe, stay here.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.560
Why the hell
would I do that?

16:35.562 --> 16:37.562
I think you might stand out
as a federal agent.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.763
Exactamundo.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.433
What are you doing?
Excellent question.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.603
A crucible for hackers,
dark site trolls.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.605
Never bring your credit
cards to a place like this.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.673
Less savory types

16:48.675 --> 16:51.776
That'll get your numbers
from the magnetic strips.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.712
My god.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.481
All right, we're on comms.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.588
Paige: I've seen pictures
of these conventions.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.789
They don't do them justice.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.458
World's largest
gathering of virgins.

17:07.460 --> 17:11.062
The after-hours parties at these
things can get pretty filthy.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.632
The last signal leads
to the room down there.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.271
Hi. Hi, there.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.340
Uh, we need access to this room.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.808
That's the vip tournament area.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.044
Access is by game play only.

17:26.046 --> 17:30.281
30 kills in 30 seconds on a game
no one's played in ten years?

17:30.283 --> 17:32.383
That's the rule, grandpa.
I didn't make it.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.786
"grandpa"? I'm 32.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.354
Happy:
Hey, guys,

17:36.356 --> 17:38.322
The last ping from minidanger
came from in that room.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.124
If I can get 30 kills
in ten seconds,

17:40.126 --> 17:40.825
Can all my friends get in?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.427
(scoffs) not possible.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.269
(video game music playing)

18:01.113 --> 18:03.214
Thirty-three.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.285
I've never seen anything
like that before.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.352
Can we go in now?

18:09.221 --> 18:09.620
Yeah.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.223
Thanks.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.225
Wait, I have seen something
like that before.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.161
Hey, wait.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.763
Is he el guapo?

18:18.765 --> 18:21.499
"el guapo"?

18:24.169 --> 18:25.103
(rock music, video game
sound effects playing)

18:29.508 --> 18:30.842
Cabe:
What's our progress?

18:30.844 --> 18:32.510
Nothing more
from minidanger.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.213
Makes it a bit of a needle
in a haystack.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.551
Toby: Maybe the guy on the left.
Sensitive face.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.520
I can see him
being easy to offend.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.155
Catch this guy,
and ralph's off the hook.

18:44.157 --> 18:49.227
You know, I could just
yell out, "hey, minidanger,

18:49.229 --> 18:50.561
Your government would like
to speak with you."

18:50.563 --> 18:54.332
The kid on stage
just got very alert to you.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.634
Talking with your finger in
your ear might have tipped him.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.770
And I think he made me, too.

18:59.772 --> 19:00.805
Yeah! (whoops)

19:00.807 --> 19:02.773
(crowd cheering)

19:02.775 --> 19:04.609
Toby: He's running.
Keep your eye on him.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.479
Great, we lost him.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.314
I got this. I can fix it.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.519
Attention, fans of this game.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.188
We trust you're enjoying
your promotional hooded capes.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.656
You mean vontanian
cloakings.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.324
That's exactly right.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.593
Now, sewn into the lining
of one, and only one,

19:22.595 --> 19:25.263
Cloaking is a ticket
that grants you a small role

19:25.265 --> 19:26.597
In the latest version
of the game.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.599
Yes, that's right!

19:28.601 --> 19:30.835
You could literally be
in the game!

19:32.471 --> 19:34.672
Paige: He'll be the only one
still wearing a cape.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.642
Walter:
I see him, I got him.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.577
There!

19:39.579 --> 19:41.279
Cabe, he's on the move.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.446
He's wearing a red cloak.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.915
Cover the exit
off the main hall,

19:43.917 --> 19:45.650
We'll check the southeast doors.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.355
Out of my way.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.590
Excuse me.

20:01.466 --> 20:04.202
Thanks.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.506
I'm telling you,
swearing to you,

20:08.508 --> 20:10.474
Whatever you think I did,
you have the wrong guy.

20:10.476 --> 20:14.245
Did you design the game <i>overt</i>
<i>target</i> and post it online?

20:16.548 --> 20:18.549
Then we have the right guy.

20:18.551 --> 20:22.220
He admits to
designing the game.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.488
Yeah, but why so easily?

20:24.490 --> 20:25.590
Minidanger:
Wait, stop.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.559
There's no secret level
in my game.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.728
The justice department calls
it "the safe house level."

20:30.730 --> 20:32.730
It's awfully authentic.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.266
What do you know about the hack
of the langley mainframe

20:35.268 --> 20:37.268
At cia headquarters
three weeks ago?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.837
Oh, my god.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.873
God ain't here with you, kid.
It's just me.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.012
You can have my laptop,
all my hard drives,

20:48.014 --> 20:53.284
If you're so squeaky clean, then
why'd you run at the convention?

20:53.286 --> 20:55.620
All right, all right,
I may have made a few bucks

20:55.622 --> 20:58.522
Hacking the dmv to take points
off a few people's licenses.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.323
Well done.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.658
He's telling the truth.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.792
Then how the hell did...

21:01.794 --> 21:02.927
Walter. Walter.
Hey, buddy!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.595
Then how the hell

21:04.597 --> 21:06.564
Did the safe house level
get on your game?

21:06.566 --> 21:07.598
Walter, what are you doing?

21:07.600 --> 21:08.532
Walter:
A ten-year-old

21:08.534 --> 21:10.034
Who you involved in this

21:10.036 --> 21:11.702
Hangs in the balance right now.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.803
I don't know any kid.

21:12.805 --> 21:13.838
Scorpjr1.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.539
You communicated with him.

21:15.541 --> 21:18.376
Scropjr1 is ten?

21:18.378 --> 21:19.577
Wow, he's a smart kid.

21:19.579 --> 21:20.878
But it was just about game play.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.513
No cia secrets.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.015
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.583
Neither did my partner.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.584
Partner?

21:26.586 --> 21:27.585
Calvin thorne.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.653
Walter:
Or maybe you're just

21:28.655 --> 21:29.820
Pulling a name out of a hat.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.756
He's not.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.659
Calvin would take
the hard drives, do revisions.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.394
He'd never do anything
like this.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.695
When did you hook up
with this calvin?

21:37.697 --> 21:39.697
He noticed an early version
of my game online,

21:39.699 --> 21:41.732
Then offered to come on board
as a collaborator.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.668
Coding, research.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.703
These spy games
can't write themselves.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.645
Toby: I am sensing
integrity markers

21:54.647 --> 21:56.047
In his voice,
his pitch consistency,

21:56.049 --> 21:57.515
Lack of shifty eye movement.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.617
He's telling the truth;
there's a calvin.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.819
Maybe this calvin
did the cia hack.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.755
And he commandeered nate's game
to deliver the intelligence?

22:04.757 --> 22:06.891
Cabe: Meaning the guy
that stole the cia intel,

22:06.893 --> 22:09.660
Maybe calvin, is out there
peddling more information.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.596
Eckherd claims that six other
operations were compromised.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.732
We're talking a hundred
more lives are at risk.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.400
Explain how this worked.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.736
If I stole cia intelligence,
then I'd need buyers

22:18.738 --> 22:22.406
And a way to deliver the intel
that wouldn't trace back to me.

22:22.408 --> 22:23.841
He used the black sites
to find the buyers,

22:23.843 --> 22:25.609
Then find a patsy-- nate--

22:25.611 --> 22:27.778
And piggyback the information
into his online project,

22:27.780 --> 22:29.413
In this case, a game.

22:29.415 --> 22:30.414
Sylvester:
You tell the buyer

22:30.416 --> 22:31.415
When the game goes live.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.550
You give him the password,

22:32.552 --> 22:34.618
And then he finds
the stolen cia intel

22:34.620 --> 22:36.053
Hidden in the game.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.789
Waiting for
the right person to access it.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.591
Paige:
Except in this case,

22:40.593 --> 22:43.928
The wrong person
found the hidden level-- ralph.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.530
It made him look guilty
because it was hidden so well.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.631
And we're certain that nate's

22:47.633 --> 22:49.433
Told us everything
that he knows?

22:49.435 --> 22:51.535
When it comes to
russian rockets, I'm all thumbs.

22:51.537 --> 22:56.574
Wanting nate to be the bad guy
doesn't make him the bad guy.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.376
Okay, then we should be
talking to calvin,

22:58.378 --> 23:00.511
'cause he's the one who actually
might have hacked the cia,

23:00.513 --> 23:01.679
Who actually might be
the bad guy,

23:01.681 --> 23:03.447
Or we can stand around all day.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.824
Maybe if we take him for
a walk around the block,

23:13.826 --> 23:15.092
He'll get his
appetite back.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.694
No, we need to stay close.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.396
Okay, I'm not trying
to make things worse,

23:18.398 --> 23:20.731
But a few weeks ago, the garage
was torn apart by killers.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.466
It's not exactly a gymboree.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.168
I've been thinking
the same thing, too, but...

23:24.170 --> 23:25.703
I know you feel walter
is good for him...

23:25.705 --> 23:28.105
Drew, the whole team
is good for him.

23:28.107 --> 23:31.742
I'm no genius, but I was a kid,
and so were you.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.745
Ralph is special, but that
doesn't mean these guys

23:34.747 --> 23:36.414
Should be treating him
like an adult.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.015
Maybe they didn't have

23:38.017 --> 23:39.583
Normal childhoods, paige,

23:39.585 --> 23:41.886
But I'm worried that they may be
taking one from ralph.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.666
He wasn't home.
Wait, why do you
have a safe?

23:55.668 --> 23:59.937
So whatever tech he's got,
guaranteed he keeps it in there.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.639
You stole that?

24:01.641 --> 24:02.807
Let's go with "seized."

24:02.809 --> 24:06.577
Not to mention ralph, we're not
looking for permissions.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.145
Okay, well, if he wasn't there,
how'd you guys get in?

24:08.147 --> 24:09.146
I picked the lock.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.816
I've been watching happy.

24:11.818 --> 24:12.783
Yeah, we've noticed.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.118
Speaking of which, where is she?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.754
No, we got to crack that safe.
Go get her.

24:16.756 --> 24:19.857
Hello, didn't I just get
us into that apartment?

24:19.859 --> 24:21.992
You know, she's not the only one
on our team with skills.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.160
All right, you're insulted

24:23.162 --> 24:24.695
Because earlier she called you
a spiller.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.697
We can't waste time
just so you can prove her wrong.

24:26.699 --> 24:27.898
I wasn't insulted.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.200
I just have
psychological insight.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.734
I got it.

24:30.736 --> 24:33.204
It's calvin--
he's cold, precise,

24:33.206 --> 24:34.472
Detail-oriented.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.773
I looked around
his place.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.209
With him, it's the
little things.

24:38.211 --> 24:41.045
Pile of mail told us
that his middle initial is "w."

24:41.047 --> 24:43.814
That is a powerful letter,
and 23rd in the alphabet.

24:46.585 --> 24:47.618
(grunts)

24:49.721 --> 24:51.155
Get happy.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.094
Cabe, walter,

24:57.096 --> 24:58.996
Grimace.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.100
How long?

25:03.102 --> 25:04.902
Uh, 30 seconds, tops.

25:16.815 --> 25:17.948
There's no computer
in there?

25:17.950 --> 25:18.916
No.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.919
Just a two-terabyte hard drive.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.957
That's our main backup storage.

25:32.664 --> 25:33.898
There are multiple index levels
to this thing.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.935
Deep encryption
in the lower depth.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.803
Oh, but look
at what I just found.

25:39.805 --> 25:41.906
Cia files.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.574
Okay, so we know that
six of them were stolen.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.743
Now we know
who stole them.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.944
I-I don't get it.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.547
What is this?
He played you.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.815
Six files means
six more safe houses.

25:51.817 --> 25:54.618
Cia operations
and multiple identities

25:54.620 --> 25:56.053
That he can sell and expose,

25:56.055 --> 25:57.955
Resulting in how many
more dead agents.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.926
That the only thing we can tell
is that they are cia files,

26:01.928 --> 26:05.829
But to know which six locations
are at risk would take hours.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.666
Odds are calvin's
already sold the intel

26:08.668 --> 26:09.967
For delivery in the game,

26:09.969 --> 26:11.802
And buyers are waiting.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.904
Statistically,
I'd say that's 91% likely.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.906
Nate, where's calvin?

26:15.908 --> 26:18.976
First place I'd try is the brick
and porter cafÃ© on angel street.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.678
That's mostly where
we worked on the game.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.646
We're headed there now.
What about me?

26:22.648 --> 26:23.914
You could use a good lawyer.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.616
Wait.

26:25.618 --> 26:26.784
You'll have an easier time
putting him away

26:26.786 --> 26:28.953
With a confession, right?

26:28.955 --> 26:30.821
I can get him to talk.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.122
Please, you got
to let me help.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.324
Can you wire him up?

26:33.326 --> 26:34.959
I can do it on the way.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.094
All right, I'll have eckherd
meet us at the spot.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.162
Happy, you drive
like a maniac.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.997
Get us there fast.
Sweet.

26:39.999 --> 26:43.000
You keep digging
into calvin's hard drive.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.868
On it.

27:01.686 --> 27:03.754
Calvin's settling into
his second cup of coffee.

27:03.756 --> 27:04.955
The guy's in the zone.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.757
Agent eckherd's
got his team rolling.

27:06.759 --> 27:07.958
They'll be here
in three minutes.

27:07.960 --> 27:11.695
We'll be recording everything
you and calvin say.

27:11.697 --> 27:13.998
I'm sorry I got
that boy involved.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.799
You're not the one
who got him involved.

27:15.801 --> 27:16.900
I'm surprised

27:16.902 --> 27:18.002
He was so young.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.970
Dark site board's no place
for a kid.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.373
Please keep your remaining
thoughts to yourself.

27:23.408 --> 27:26.076
Good to go.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.345
Cabe: Start by telling calvin
you found the hidden level.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.914
Ask him what he put in the game.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.349
Hey.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.917
Are you sure about this?

27:33.919 --> 27:35.953
Yes. I want to make this right.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.022
Toby: Just maintain
eye contact

27:38.024 --> 27:40.357
And keep a calm tone
of voice, piece of cake.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.026
Cabe: Department of justice
is coming to back us up.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.093
Just stay cool.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.094
Okay.

27:48.967 --> 27:50.768
Nate:
Hey, man.

27:50.770 --> 27:51.902
Calvin:
Hey, nate.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.438
What brings you?

27:54.440 --> 27:56.273
Nate:
I was...

27:56.275 --> 27:57.975
Just in the area.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.443
Calvin:
You're sweating like a pig.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.212
Nate: (chuckles)
it's hot out.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.381
That tone of voice
is anything but calm.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.883
(phone ringing)

28:07.953 --> 28:11.922
I found some bad stuff on
the hard drive, personal data.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.224
He erased it a while ago,
but I was able to dig it up.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.026
Turns out, calvin's name

28:16.028 --> 28:17.194
Is not calvin.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.729
It's donald chen,

28:18.731 --> 28:20.197
And he's got a record.
Weapons possession,

28:20.199 --> 28:22.299
Black hat hacking, assault.

28:22.301 --> 28:25.135
Man, nate had no idea who
he was getting into bed with.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.770
Nice work, sylvester.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.038
Nate:
So what you working on now?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.239
Calvin:
Finishing up six new levels

28:29.241 --> 28:30.307
For the game.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.875
Launching them in an hour.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.778
That's got to be the other
six stolen cia files.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.013
He's gonna blow the operations
in one hour.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.848
As soon as he gets a confession
from calvin,

28:37.850 --> 28:38.882
We go in and it's over.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.317
Nate:
So-so, look, I, um...

28:40.319 --> 28:41.919
I got to ask you something.

28:41.921 --> 28:42.986
It's pretty weird.

28:42.988 --> 28:45.389
I-I found a hidden level
in our game.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.990
(sighs)

28:46.992 --> 28:51.028
Tell you what...
I need a smoke.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.096
I don't like the sound of that,

28:52.098 --> 28:53.163
But we don't have
a confession yet.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.465
We got to get nate out of there.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.133
Let's talk out back?

28:56.135 --> 28:59.770
According to satellite maps,
that's an alley.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.405
Nate: Calvin,
what are you doing? (screams)

29:01.407 --> 29:03.440
We lost contact.
Pull around back now.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.275
Cabe:
Agent eckherd will meet us.

29:05.277 --> 29:08.078
Happy: There he is!
He's on the ground.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.114
Toby:
I think I see blood.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.116
(whimpering)

29:12.118 --> 29:13.050
Nate, what happened?

29:13.052 --> 29:15.119
He stabbed me and ran.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.353
Buddy, hey, hey, buddy. Hey.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.255
(sirens wailing)

29:18.257 --> 29:20.023
Nate, you're gonna be okay.

29:20.025 --> 29:21.258
Hey, look at me, look at me.
You're gonna be fine.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.961
Did your team botch this
all to hell, gallo?

29:23.963 --> 29:25.529
Not now!
Suspect's in the wind.

29:25.531 --> 29:26.964
Fan out, find him!

29:26.966 --> 29:28.132
Nate, nate, nate?

29:28.134 --> 29:29.366
Come on, keep
your eyes open.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.001
He's fading fast.

29:32.036 --> 29:34.271
The whitehull hospital
is four minutes away.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.073
Okay, we're on it.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.909
20 cc's of diesel therapy, stat.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.144
Walter:
Toby, keep him breathing!

29:42.046 --> 29:44.148
This neighborhood's nothing

29:44.150 --> 29:45.249
But abandoned buildings
and warehouses.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.483
Yeah, plenty of
places to hide.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.552
Oh, this looks familiar.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.854
So you got the bridge,
you got dozens of factories,

29:50.856 --> 29:52.856
You got this cafÃ©.
We're in the game.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.057
What the hell
are you talking about?

29:54.059 --> 29:55.259
Nate and calvin designed
the first level

29:55.261 --> 29:58.162
What they were looking at
every day and night

29:58.164 --> 29:59.897
While they were coding
in that cafÃ©.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.933
So if calvin's gonna hide,
this is the perfect spot.

30:02.935 --> 30:05.068
No one knows this area
better than he does.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.204
Except ralph.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.807
He knows the game,
which means he knows this area

30:09.809 --> 30:12.976
Like the back of his hand.

30:12.978 --> 30:16.180
If we're gonna find calvin
before he leaks that cia intel,

30:16.182 --> 30:18.081
Ralph has to play
that game again

30:18.083 --> 30:19.516
And lead us to him.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.185
Paige:
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

30:21.187 --> 30:23.120
This morning,
that game landed him

30:23.122 --> 30:24.488
In a room with federal agents.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.356
It's the only way
to find this guy in time.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.192
We only got a half
dozen people searching,

30:28.194 --> 30:31.562
Walter: But right now,
we need an advantage,

30:31.564 --> 30:34.965
I thought he was never
playing that game again.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.235
Mom, can I?

30:43.875 --> 30:45.375
(horn honking)

30:48.012 --> 30:49.947
All right,
got to open this up a little,

30:49.949 --> 30:51.315
See where the damage is.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.050
His internal
epiploic artery is cut.

30:53.052 --> 30:56.053
I'm gonna need more pressure.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.988
Hey, happy,
I got to cross a line here.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.289
Do you have a tampon?

30:59.291 --> 31:00.324
Excuse me?

31:00.326 --> 31:03.994
Expand, increase the pressure
and stop the bleeding.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.929
Uh, toolbox, bottom compartment.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.332
Yeah? Ah!

31:08.334 --> 31:11.034
(horn honking)

31:11.036 --> 31:14.638
Uh... Ah...

31:14.640 --> 31:16.974
It's working!

31:16.976 --> 31:17.941
Hold on!

31:17.943 --> 31:19.309
(horn honking)

31:20.245 --> 31:22.479
Drew:
I don't like this.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.948
Neither do I, but
they need his help.

31:24.950 --> 31:27.618
I'm in.
Okay, walter,
ralph's in the game.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.286
Walter: Copy.
The best way for us
to help you

31:29.288 --> 31:30.654
Is to pinpoint
your exact location,

31:30.656 --> 31:32.422
Go to that same spot
in the game, and guide you.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.258
And, walter, you need to hurry,

31:34.260 --> 31:35.626
Because there's
a countdown clock

31:35.628 --> 31:38.528
With six new levels coming
in 19 minutes and 50 seconds.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.264
We need to catch calvin
before they're released.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.099
All right, well,
we're on the east side

31:42.101 --> 31:44.101
Of angel street
outside a factory.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.202
What color is it?

31:45.204 --> 31:47.104
Walter:
Uh, it's gray and white.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.171
That one has a hidden entrance.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.340
Look for an alley
straight ahead.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.042
The a/c grate
on the north side

31:52.044 --> 31:54.044
By the telephone poles,
enter there.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.146
Ralph:
It accesses a lower level

31:56.148 --> 31:58.582
You can't get to
from the main floor.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.417
I'm playing that level now.

32:03.354 --> 32:05.122
Calvin's got to be
hiding in there.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.556
Look alive.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.492
All right, we're heading in.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.266
Did you find hallway pw-99?

32:19.071 --> 32:22.205
Ralph: This floor
has the most hiding places.

32:22.207 --> 32:23.540
They should go southeast.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.575
Sylvester:
Okay, guys, you heard him.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.481
Hey!

32:31.483 --> 32:33.951
Cabe, cabe, you okay?

32:33.953 --> 32:35.319
(groans):
Yeah, I'm good.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.421
Let's go catch
that son of a bitch.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.522
Okay.

32:40.491 --> 32:43.393
(tires screeching)

32:43.395 --> 32:45.362
Two minutes to the e.R.!
Bleeding's under control.

32:46.531 --> 32:48.498
Maybe too much.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.235
Ah, damn, the bleeding slowed
down 'cause his heart stopped.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.603
Where's the quick jump?

32:53.605 --> 32:55.639
Happy!
The jumper cables, now!

32:55.641 --> 32:57.541
Uh, it's, uh...
It's under the console.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.710
Okay, here we go.

32:59.712 --> 33:02.212
So, doc, clamp the black one
to the metal part of the seat,

33:02.214 --> 33:03.747
And then take the
red one and zap him.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.182
Uh... Clear?

33:08.586 --> 33:10.220
(panting)

33:10.222 --> 33:11.722
All right, he's back.

33:12.623 --> 33:14.691
Holy crap, dr. Frankenstein!

33:17.495 --> 33:20.197
All right, he headed south.
I need a shortcut.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.134
According to ralph,
look for a door on your left

33:24.136 --> 33:25.235
Marked 6-5-9.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.070
That's how calvin would escape.

33:27.072 --> 33:30.240
Okay, head through
the opening in the fence,

33:30.242 --> 33:31.742
And hang a right.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.643
You should
catch up to him there.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.713
Is this my only way out?

33:36.715 --> 33:37.748
Sylvester:
It's the fastest.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.349
Toby:
Stab wound, upper abdomen,

33:39.351 --> 33:41.184
And there's a severed
epiploic artery.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.120
He's gonna need
a couple units in the o.R.

33:43.122 --> 33:46.023
Oh... I'm rocking so much
adrenaline right now,

33:46.025 --> 33:47.524
My blood is basically red bull.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.527
Impressive.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.529
Guys, guys...

33:52.531 --> 33:56.133
I'm looking at a...
A rather large drop.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.101
It's unknown depth.
It's, uh...

33:58.103 --> 33:59.503
Yeah, no...
It's too far to jump.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.538
You can jump down
and walk across.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.639
Are you sure?

34:02.641 --> 34:04.141
Yes.
It's only a seven-foot drop.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.509
I can tell by how

34:05.511 --> 34:07.477
The graphics are composited.
I can't see the bottom.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.546
It could be seven feet or 70.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.248
Now, are you sure, ralph?

34:11.250 --> 34:13.050
Scoop.
What?

34:13.052 --> 34:14.618
It's about a scoop
of ice cream after school.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.520
He-he'd make me "scoop swear"
that we'd actually go.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.488
It's the strongest promise
he can make.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.490
Okay.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.759
I trust you, ralph.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.806
Sylvester (over radio):
Walter?

34:35.808 --> 34:36.840
Are you okay?

34:36.842 --> 34:38.842
Yeah, thanks to ralph.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.750
I got a visual. He's fast.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.386
There should be a lever
in front of you.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.588
It opens the storage bay
in front of the exit.

34:52.557 --> 34:54.791
I see the lever.
Pull it! Pull it now!

35:00.631 --> 35:01.698
Did it work?

35:02.667 --> 35:04.234
(calvin groaning)

35:05.203 --> 35:07.504
Sylvester:
Walter?

35:07.506 --> 35:09.773
Yeah, it worked.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.381
You're really going
at that thing, huh?

35:18.383 --> 35:19.616
It calms me.

35:19.618 --> 35:23.186
After today... Calm is good.

35:23.188 --> 35:25.355
Hey, e.R. Doc called.

35:25.357 --> 35:26.857
Looks like nate's gonna make it.

35:28.226 --> 35:29.693
You know, no one on
this team could've

35:29.695 --> 35:31.561
Pulled off what
you did today.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.130
Well done.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.134
You know,
something occurred to me.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.337
For your rocket--
with trauma wounds,

35:40.339 --> 35:42.606
The body protects the head
and the heart and the gut

35:42.608 --> 35:44.741
By focusing blood flow
in those areas,

35:44.743 --> 35:46.243
Just like nate's body
did today.

35:46.245 --> 35:49.646
What if you adjusted
fuel flow the same way?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.681
Cover the injector head
with a metal plate

35:51.683 --> 35:53.717
That's perforated with holes,
like stab wounds.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.585
Covering more or fewer
of the holes

35:55.587 --> 35:57.854
Will allow for
a variable fuel flow <i>and...</i>

35:57.856 --> 35:59.890
Increase throttleability.

35:59.892 --> 36:02.425
That's a good idea.

36:02.427 --> 36:03.560
I got a million of them.

36:04.695 --> 36:07.497
Hey, walt...

36:07.499 --> 36:08.665
About the kid?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.367
Yeah, we were having fun.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.537
Um... Too much fun.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.572
Look, he needs you,
you're a huge part of his life,

36:15.574 --> 36:16.740
But you can't just
be his friend.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.375
You got to be
the grown-up, too.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.810
Yeah.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.284
We have a celebrity
in our midst.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.752
Oh, stop,
you're making me blush.

36:28.754 --> 36:29.920
Not you, idiot.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.555
An online video?
What...?

36:31.557 --> 36:34.658
"el guapo sets another record."

36:34.660 --> 36:35.659
What is that?
What?

36:35.661 --> 36:37.561
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

36:37.563 --> 36:38.762
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

36:38.764 --> 36:40.230
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

36:40.232 --> 36:41.798
Wait a minute.
(cheering over video)

36:41.800 --> 36:44.801
Is that
a young sylvester?

36:44.803 --> 36:48.505
Earlier, that gamer girl
asked me if sly was el guapo.

36:48.507 --> 36:49.639
Now we know why.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.708
Please... No.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.610
(cheering continues over video)

36:53.612 --> 36:55.545
Those are some
fascinating moves.

36:56.747 --> 36:59.883
Happy: Hard to look at,
but impossible to turn away.

37:01.285 --> 37:02.719
El guapo!

37:02.721 --> 37:04.387
Crowd (cheering):
El guapo!

37:04.389 --> 37:06.423
(cheering continues)

37:06.425 --> 37:07.891
(beep, video stops)

37:07.893 --> 37:10.327
Life will never be the same.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.796
I can't believe
this was online for seven years

37:12.798 --> 37:14.431
And you never said anything
about it.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.767
The fashion is unflattering,
and the dance is derivative.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.669
You're their hero.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.272
Well, I guess we all have
our hidden talents.

37:22.274 --> 37:23.773
That's beautifully put,
el guapo.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.517
For what it's worth,
I know it's my fault

37:34.519 --> 37:36.553
That you're here
in the first place,

37:36.555 --> 37:39.256
So I'm gonna make it right.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.791
I'm gonna work my ass off
for that gig in portland,

37:41.793 --> 37:44.361
Give you and ralph a
shot at something else.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.730
This is not about you and me
getting back together.

37:46.732 --> 37:49.699
This is about us being a family,

37:49.701 --> 37:53.270
All in the same place, all safe.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.672
What if we don't want to leave?

37:55.674 --> 37:57.907
Well, before you have a choice,
how can you know?

38:01.879 --> 38:03.480
Uh, we're heading out.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.682
Just packing up ralph's things.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.518
Take your time.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.553
I apologize for everything
I did to contribute

38:10.555 --> 38:12.055
To what ralph
went through today.

38:14.525 --> 38:15.892
But...

38:15.894 --> 38:18.061
There it is.

38:21.932 --> 38:24.601
But I do want to note,

38:24.603 --> 38:27.804
Those stolen cia files
contained the identities

38:27.806 --> 38:29.873
Of 43 undercover operatives.

38:29.875 --> 38:33.743
They, in turn,
protected 356 source assets

38:33.745 --> 38:36.780
Relating to drug trafficking,
gangs,

38:36.782 --> 38:38.815
Loose nuclear material.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.584
By preventing the release
of those files,

38:41.586 --> 38:44.387
Ralph saved
innumerable lives today.

38:45.356 --> 38:47.590
Drew:
I'm glad he could help.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.828
I'm just not sure
it's a good idea

38:51.830 --> 38:53.897
For him to grow up this fast.

38:56.467 --> 38:58.802
Ralph sees us
using our heads for good.

38:58.804 --> 39:02.539
He's learning how to be
a grown-up genius someday.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.874
We're not trying
to make him a grown-up now.

39:06.944 --> 39:09.012
I'll meet you downstairs.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.018
I'm aware I screwed up.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.954
I just wish
I could get a guarantee from you

39:17.956 --> 39:19.689
That this won't happen again.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.057
I'm not sure I can give you one.

39:21.059 --> 39:24.561
I know you can't.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.796
So what do I gamble on, walter?

39:26.798 --> 39:30.033
I couldn't advise you;
gambling is toby's department.

39:31.902 --> 39:36.806
Paige, I care about
this team and our work...

39:36.808 --> 39:39.909
But what I care about most...

39:42.079 --> 39:45.048
...Is giving ralph a safe place
to reach his potential.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.650
He has a lot of it.
I know that, too.

39:49.820 --> 39:53.089
Oh. Do you remember
when you and ralph turned up,

39:53.091 --> 39:54.724
And I gave him that riddle?

39:54.726 --> 39:57.727
What is a group
of jellyfish called?

39:57.729 --> 39:59.062
Yeah. A smack?

39:59.064 --> 40:02.432
If you want to give me one now,
I would understand.

40:04.468 --> 40:06.903
(laughs)

40:06.905 --> 40:08.905
That's funny, walter.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.907
I do try.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.109
I know you do.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.048
Good night.
