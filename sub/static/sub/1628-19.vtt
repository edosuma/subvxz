NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.421
-|'m Tamara.
-Emma.

00:04.547 --> 00:05.707
She's my fiancee.

00:06.591 --> 00:07.580
Not my son!

00:08.050 --> 00:09.176
Dad!

00:09.302 --> 00:10.417
Don't stop!

00:10.553 --> 00:11.508
Run!

00:11.596 --> 00:12.836
I'm not leaving without my father.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.421
I'm afraid you are.
Because he's not here.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.014
-Emma.
-August?

00:17.101 --> 00:18.887
Listen. I have to warn you.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.263
(CRACKUNG)

00:21.856 --> 00:23.096
Sorry I'm late. It's been a heck of a day.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.443
EMMA: Before you turned
into a little boy,

00:26.569 --> 00:28.605
you were trying to
warn us about something.

00:28.863 --> 00:29.898
I don't remember.

00:30.448 --> 00:32.188
|wi|| go with you forever.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.272
Deal!

00:33.409 --> 00:34.444
(GUNSHOT)

00:34.619 --> 00:36.200
-GOLD: Belle!
-Who's Belle?

00:36.287 --> 00:39.199
You will be reunited with your son.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.279
How?

00:40.416 --> 00:43.032
A young boy will lead you to him.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.629
The boy will be your undoing.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.873
Then I'll just have to kill him.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.046
(BLOWING)

00:50.134 --> 00:52.420
(ALL CHEERING)

00:53.471 --> 00:55.962
And now, my boy, for your present.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.764
Pick one object from the
shop. Anything you like.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.394
That!

01:15.284 --> 01:17.741
Hey, careful, buddy,
wands are powerful.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.568
-So how does it work?
-Ah. ..

01:19.664 --> 01:21.495
Here, let me show you.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.420
(ALL GASPING)

01:33.511 --> 01:34.500
DAVID: Why would you do that?

01:34.679 --> 01:35.668
The prophecy.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.845
The seer said the boy
would be my undoing.

01:37.974 --> 01:41.137
So I have no choice. I must be his.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.182

02:11.257 --> 02:13.669
Aha! Whoa!

02:15.011 --> 02:16.342
(HENRY GRUNTS)

02:18.055 --> 02:20.637
Seems like we've
both been pushed to the sidelines.

02:20.725 --> 02:22.056
What are you doing here?

02:22.184 --> 02:25.802
The real question is,
what is your son doing with mine?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.056
(NEAL LAUGHING)

02:27.398 --> 02:28.387
Oh, that?

02:29.150 --> 02:32.313
That's right, you didn't get the
birth announcement, did you?

02:33.738 --> 02:35.694
That's Henry's father.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.238
What?

02:38.326 --> 02:39.816
Do l have to spell it out for you?

02:39.910 --> 02:41.320
Miss Swan and my son...

02:41.412 --> 02:43.403
You're Henry's grandfather?

02:43.748 --> 02:45.409
Guess that makes us family.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.535
He's got my eyes, don't you think?

02:48.711 --> 02:50.497
You did this.

02:50.588 --> 02:53.421
Trust me, dearie, it was as much a
shock to me as it is to you.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.998
(SCOFFS) No. You must have known.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.836
When I adopted him,
it was you who procured him for me.

03:00.931 --> 03:04.014
You expect me to
believe that that was a coincidence?

03:04.101 --> 03:06.592
No, not coincidence. Fate.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.929
And apparently
fate has a sense of humor.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.354
Fate.

03:11.776 --> 03:15.064
So you're playing the part
of the loving grandpa now?

03:16.781 --> 03:18.442
They won't accept you.

03:19.241 --> 03:22.199
No matter what you do.
Not your son. Not any of them.

03:22.453 --> 03:23.442
Yeah, we'll see.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.865
I've already seen, Gold.

03:25.956 --> 03:29.744
I've seen your dark heart,
and it always wins out.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.702
You always choose darkness.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.958
You know, you think
you know me, dearie.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.538
But you don't.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.465
I know you well enough.

03:39.470 --> 03:42.553
If your own son
couldn't bring out the good in you,

03:44.475 --> 03:46.215
who will?

03:51.524 --> 03:53.981
(WOMAN CHATTERING OVER PA)

03:58.614 --> 04:01.731
(GASPS) You're alive?

04:02.326 --> 04:03.611
Indeed, I am.

04:10.251 --> 04:13.414
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) Sounded
like you were on your death bed.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.836
I'm really sorry if I startled you.

04:16.841 --> 04:19.298
I know that you have no memory of me,

04:19.677 --> 04:22.339
but my feelings for you are real.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.004
And ljust needed you
to know that in case,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.006
well, in case I died.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.766
I'm glad you're okay.

04:30.688 --> 04:33.100
And I could tell your feelings were true.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.441
You could?

04:34.525 --> 04:36.686
I have a sense about people.

04:36.819 --> 04:40.858
I can't explain how, but I could just tell.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.779
So you believe we know each other.

04:42.867 --> 04:46.860
I believe that whatever
caused me to forget myself

04:51.208 --> 04:53.290
And that past probably included you.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.463
It did.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.048
When I...

05:02.136 --> 05:04.127
When Iwas injured, I...

05:04.638 --> 05:06.469
(LAUGHS) This is going to sound crazy,

05:07.516 --> 05:08.801
(CLEARS THROAT)

05:10.227 --> 05:12.058
I remember you healing me.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.568
You've been through a lot.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.817
Serious injury,

05:20.905 --> 05:24.068
all the drugs you've
been on since you've been in here.

05:24.867 --> 05:28.860
Once you remember
who you are, it will all become clear.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.738
Can you help me do that?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.745
Remember who I am?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.827
Only if you help me remember who I am.

05:38.756 --> 05:39.836
Sorry, what?

05:40.174 --> 05:43.211
Belle, you always brought
out the best in me.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.047
And, right now, I need that.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.760
So, yes, Iwill do everything I
can to bring you back.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.762
For you. And for me.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.181
We can help each other.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.107
Yeah.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.108
Let's talk to someone
about getting you out of here.

06:06.951 --> 06:10.068
You've been locked up long enough.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.035
(BELLE WEEPING)

06:14.833 --> 06:16.539
(DOOR CREAKS OPEN)

06:17.127 --> 06:20.210
When you so eagerly agreed
to come and work for me,

06:20.297 --> 06:23.289
I assumed you wouldn't
miss your family quite so much.

06:23.425 --> 06:27.794
I made my sacrifice for them. Of
course I miss them, you beast.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.880
Yes, yes. Of course.
But the crying must stop.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.385
Night after night.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.888
It's making it very difficult for me to spin.

06:34.979 --> 06:37.095
You know, I do my best thinking then.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.139
Here.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.066
Perhaps this will help?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.233
For me?

06:44.321 --> 06:46.482
Not quite so beastly now, am I?

06:46.865 --> 06:47.900
Thank you.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.653
Maybe now I can
actually get some sleep.

06:50.786 --> 06:53.243
No,no,no,no.
It's not to help you sleep, dearie.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.946
It's to muffle the cries
so I can get back to work!

Are you sure you want to do this, dearie?

07:11.849 --> 07:13.259
Pretty sure.

07:13.809 --> 07:17.472
If you don't know how to use that wand, it
can do nasty things to you.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.346
Well, then,

07:21.025 --> 07:22.936
I'll stick to what I know works.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.358
You know what this arrow can do to you?

07:25.446 --> 07:27.027
Has to hit me first.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.283
Shouldn't be a problem.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.037
An arrow fired from this bow
always finds its target.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.369

07:45.007 --> 07:46.213
Uhh! (GASPS)

07:46.967 --> 07:48.207
I know I do.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.212
As do I.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.718
(GIGGLES)

07:55.893 --> 07:57.053
But don't you know?

07:57.186 --> 07:59.472
All magic comes with a price.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.726
And in your case, that's me.

Hello.

Hi.

I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.746
I'm Regina. I'm the mayor of this town.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.914
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.584
That's... That's very thorough of you.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.093
Thank you, but I'm fine.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.838

He believes he can help me
remember who I am.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.179
Does he, now?

08:47.945 --> 08:49.025
What's this, dear?

08:50.447 --> 08:51.948
Did you drop it?

08:54.535 --> 08:55.900
Don't think so.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.696
Keep looking, dear.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.132
Wait.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.253
(STAMMERS) I know What this is.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.144
I think I remember who I am.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.889
Well, I'm sure Mr. Gold will be thrilled.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.695
TAMARA: These all
the places you saw it?

09:33.782 --> 09:37.070
Yeah. This town is lousy with magic.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.150
Now you should go.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.234
If Neal suspects anything,

09:39.329 --> 09:41.581
it's gonna make everything we have to
do that much harder.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.326
Don't worry, he won't.

09:45.002 --> 09:48.244
Greg, have you had
any luck finding him?

09:48.338 --> 09:49.589
My dad?

09:49.673 --> 09:52.164
No, but he's here.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.333
I'm sure of it.

09:55.929 --> 09:56.964
We Will find him.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.177
I know.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.256
But one thing at a time.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.341
Now, you were able
to get the package here, right?

10:02.478 --> 10:04.764
It's right outside town.
Couldn'tjust drive in with it.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.595
And it's stable?

10:06.690 --> 10:08.271
Very.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.814
Hlbnng
the package in tonight. Be ready.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.116
Why are we in the middle of nowhere?

10:24.208 --> 10:26.950
Why aren't you guys
telling me what's going on?

10:27.044 --> 10:28.124
Why the secrecy?

10:28.212 --> 10:29.292
Because you need to see it.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.040
Great, that always goes well for me.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.213
Listen, whatever it is, it can wait.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.131
August was trying to
warn me about something...

10:35.219 --> 10:36.459
Someone dangerous.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.713
It doesn't matter.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.711
Why not?

10:39.807 --> 10:40.796
Because of this.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.350
ANTON: Emma!

10:54.404 --> 10:55.393
Hey.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.987
Are you here to help?
It's not quite harvest time yet.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.821
Beans? You're growing magic beans.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.243
That's what you were
up to when I was in New York?

11:03.372 --> 11:04.407
Why didn't you tell me?

11:04.498 --> 11:05.829
(CHUCKLES) We are telling you.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.998
We kept it a secret to protect the crop.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.326
Mother Superior, she cloaked the area.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.911
That way Anton can do
what he does best.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.258
Actually, you haven't
seen me play darts.

11:15.676 --> 11:16.882
But yeah, I do this pretty good.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.380
Oh, Anton, don't take
this the wrong way,

11:19.930 --> 11:21.761
(STAMMERING) but why are you so...

11:22.266 --> 11:24.348
Small? Cora.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.346
She and Regina brought some
magic to make me human-sized.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.688
I kind of like it.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.603
Enough Iollygagging. Back to it!

11:30.691 --> 11:32.022
(SHEARS CLICKING)

11:32.109 --> 11:34.100
Wow. Dwarfs really like to work.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.183
It's great to see you, Emma.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.268
(CHUCKLES) You, too.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.071
You want to use the beans
to make a portal

11:44.621 --> 11:46.202
to go back to the enchanted forest.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.246
That's the real reason you didn't tell me.

11:49.293 --> 11:52.456
What about ogres,
and destruction? And danger?

11:52.546 --> 11:55.709
We can fix all that.
We did it before. We can do it again.

11:55.799 --> 11:56.959
We can start over, Emma.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.882
So you changed your mind?
You want to go now, too?

11:59.970 --> 12:02.757
Not my mind. My heart.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.555
After what I did to Cora,

12:05.976 --> 12:08.058
I think restoring our land
is the best way to mend it.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.469
It'll be good for all of us.
The whole family. Henry.

12:11.773 --> 12:12.808
And you.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.649
And we're from there. You're from there.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.066
It's been nothing but cruel to you.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.317
And if we go back,

12:21.408 --> 12:24.775
I think you might be able
to have your happy ending.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.000
Nurse! Nurse!

was jog things back in place.

What?

Unlike you, the rest of the world

24:28.885 --> 24:32.173
isn't always scheming
to get what they want.

24:33.514 --> 24:37.052
No, you're hiding something.

24:39.729 --> 24:42.562
Well, whatever it is,
I can assure you of one thing.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.066
I'm going to find out.

-(SIGHS)

25:01.542 --> 25:03.999
Are you... Are you nervous, Mr. Gold?

25:04.087 --> 25:07.830
No. No, of course not.
I'm just deciding what to have.

25:09.384 --> 25:11.340
What the hell happened to you?

25:11.427 --> 25:13.088
You raid the back of Ruby's closets?

25:13.179 --> 25:16.012
Perhaps Lacey and I could order.

25:16.099 --> 25:17.509
Two burgers and two iced teas, please.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.184
Actually, I'm gonna
go chicken parm, and white wine.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.435
And make it the bottle.

25:23.731 --> 25:25.767
All righty. Coming up.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.273
I've never really been
much of a burger girl. I don't know.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.397
Well, whatever you want, you shall have.

25:35.118 --> 25:38.030
You know, you're a classy guy, Mr. Gold.

25:38.121 --> 25:41.955
This is not what
I was expecting from you.

25:42.083 --> 25:46.793
Given all the stuff people say about you.

25:46.879 --> 25:50.963
Oh, that again.
My reputation. What is it you hear?

25:51.467 --> 25:54.630
Oh, just that, you know,
you're the most powerful man in town.

25:54.762 --> 25:58.050
And that you got that power
from being ruthless.

25:58.141 --> 26:02.976
And that when
people cross you, they get hurt.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.480
Thank you.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.075
People like to believe the worst of me.

26:27.170 --> 26:29.752
But, Lacey, lwould rather
you believe the best.

26:29.839 --> 26:33.582
(STAMMERING) Well, I just don't
get why people are scared of you.

26:33.676 --> 26:36.964
You know, I see a man
who wouldn't hurt anyone.

26:38.014 --> 26:41.427
Thank you, Lacey.
I really needed to hear that.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.848
Especially now.

26:42.977 --> 26:44.513
Well, you know what they say,

26:44.645 --> 26:47.637
"You can't tell what's in a person's
heart until you truly know them."

26:51.444 --> 26:52.604
(LAUGHS) What... Whoa!

26:52.695 --> 26:53.855
Did I say something wrong?

26:53.946 --> 26:57.780
No, no. lt'sjust that
I knew someone once

26:57.867 --> 26:59.778
who said that exact same thing to me.

26:59.869 --> 27:00.949
Gosh, I'm so sorry. Your dress...

27:01.037 --> 27:03.028
A bit of water will take it right out.

27:03.164 --> 27:04.370
-Okay.
-Okay.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.638
I'm losing track of him.
This forest is too thick.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.469
Maybe we should return home.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.145
What, and let the thief escape?

27:30.525 --> 27:31.560
What would people think

27:31.692 --> 27:34.980
if I spared
the life of someone who stole from me?

27:35.071 --> 27:37.983
That there's actually a man
hiding behind the beast.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.234
There isn't.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.403
Then why didn't you kill me
when I freed the prisoner?

27:41.536 --> 27:42.992
Well, I would have,

27:43.079 --> 27:46.321

is really hard to find.

want people to believe.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.252
I think that deep down,
there's love in your heart.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.081
And for something more than power.

27:58.845 --> 28:02.383
You're right. There is something I love.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.297
l traced him as far as these

28:45.391 --> 28:47.803
Yes, I know exactly who you're after.

28:49.812 --> 28:53.054
But I also know who you are,
Rumplestiltskin.

28:53.149 --> 28:55.390
My reputation precedes me. Excellent.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.897

after? I've been chasing him for years.

he was hiding out in ShenNood Forest.

like. But you are going to watch.

He did it so he could heal
the woman he loves.

have died if he hadn't stolen your wand.

bourbons. Kid's a real lightweight.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.079
It sounds like you guys had a full day.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.586
Spent most of it at the park.

40:29.553 --> 40:32.295
He's getting pretty good
with those wooden swords.

40:32.389 --> 40:33.845
I guess that makes sense,

40:33.932 --> 40:35.797
considering where his family's from.

40:36.518 --> 40:37.553
What?

40:38.979 --> 40:41.391
You ever thought about going back?

40:43.150 --> 40:44.265
Back where?

40:45.902 --> 40:48.393
Home. Where we're from.

40:48.697 --> 40:49.857
Uh...

40:49.948 --> 40:52.735
I spent most of my life
trying to forget that place.

40:52.826 --> 40:55.408
I didn't exactly have
a fairy-tale childhood.

40:55.495 --> 40:56.575
You know what I mean.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.654
Why do you ask?

40:59.166 --> 41:00.576
No reason.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.077
August came by the park today.

41:02.169 --> 41:04.285
He and Henry seemed to really hit it off.

41:05.047 --> 41:08.005
That is gonna take a while
to get used to.

41:08.592 --> 41:12.005
You know, I gotta say,
he's actually a lot cooler as a kid.

41:12.095 --> 41:13.380
He steals less of my money.

41:13.472 --> 41:14.837
He'd be way cooler if he could remember

41:14.931 --> 41:17.308
what he was trying
to warn us about before he got...

41:17.517 --> 41:19.018
Rebooted?

41:21.188 --> 41:23.804
"Storybrooke isn't safe."
Isn't safe from who?

41:24.524 --> 41:26.651
He always had a knack for being cryptic.

41:26.735 --> 41:28.942
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Don't worry about it, you'll figure it out.

41:30.447 --> 41:31.687
If there's one thing I know about you,

41:31.782 --> 41:34.524
you don't stop till you find
what you're looking for.

41:54.763 --> 41:56.003
(SIGHS)

41:56.264 --> 41:58.721
Hey, beautiful. We all good?

41:59.393 --> 42:00.508
Better than good.

42:02.688 --> 42:04.519
Now, should we unwrap the package?

42:04.606 --> 42:06.142
You think he'll cooperate?

42:06.233 --> 42:07.313
I wouldn't worry about that.

42:07.401 --> 42:08.732
From what I know of him, I don't think

42:08.860 --> 42:10.191
he'll need much convincing to help us.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.358
What makes you say that?

42:12.572 --> 42:13.607
Because, if there's one person

42:13.699 --> 42:15.940
you can always count on
to do your dirty work,

42:17.369 --> 42:18.859
(DOOR THUDS)

42:19.037 --> 42:20.117
it's a pirate.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.032
(MUFFLED GRUNTING)
