11:50.405 --> 11:53.016
is the indestructibility
of these two people's love.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.670
They married,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.759
divorced, and then planned
to marry again.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.501
And the only thing
that stopped it from happening

11:59.544 --> 12:01.285
was Melanie's death.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.852
And in anticipation of that,

12:02.896 --> 12:04.985
as a symbol of what they shared,

12:05.028 --> 12:07.857
she wanted the painting
to reside with him,

12:07.901 --> 12:09.598
forever and always.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.732
Being the new kid, just curious.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.603
This sounds like a tough sell.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.605
How do you find jurors

12:16.648 --> 12:18.476
who are gonna be sympathetic
to our client?

12:18.520 --> 12:21.871
Excellent question. Ideally,
we'll be talking to people

12:21.915 --> 12:25.875
who might be best described
as possessing evolved morality.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.311
Evolved morality?

12:27.355 --> 12:29.357
Smart people who understand
that romance,

12:29.400 --> 12:32.795
that love,
that the ability to feel deeply

12:32.839 --> 12:34.318
is all part
of the human equation,

12:34.362 --> 12:37.408
and that if the law is made
to serve people,

12:37.452 --> 12:38.975
there has to be
some accommodation

12:39.019 --> 12:41.282
for their humanness.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.806
That the answer
to every question is not found

12:43.850 --> 12:46.809
within the four corners
of a document.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.159
Morning, sir.Morning.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.988
Let's imagine you pull into
a commercial parking lot.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.947
You take a ticket,
find your space.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.513
As you're getting out
of your car,

12:55.557 --> 12:57.515
you can't help but notice
a big sign.

12:57.559 --> 13:00.214
"We are not responsible
for damage to your vehicle."

13:00.257 --> 13:02.999
You attend to whatever business
brought you to the neighborhood,

13:03.043 --> 13:05.828
and when you get back,
your car window has been smashed

13:05.872 --> 13:08.222
and some packages you had in
the back seat have been stolen.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.876
What do you do?

13:09.919 --> 13:11.878
Nothing you can do.

13:11.921 --> 13:15.925
Like the sign says,
they're not responsible.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.103
Your Honor, the defense
would like to thank

13:20.147 --> 13:22.410
and excuse this juror.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.890
Just because something's
written down,

13:23.933 --> 13:25.456
whether it's a sign on the wall

13:25.500 --> 13:27.110
or the particulars
contained in a will,

13:27.154 --> 13:29.634
doesn't mean
you can't challenge it.

13:29.678 --> 13:33.116
And people with an evolved
morality understand that.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.205
How about you? It's your car.

13:35.249 --> 13:38.121
Your window that gets smashed,
your things that get taken.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.470
Do you have any recourse?

13:39.514 --> 13:42.778
Is there one of those signs up?Nope. But...

13:42.822 --> 13:44.475
the same warning is printed
on the back of the ticket

13:44.519 --> 13:45.912
you take from the machine
at the entrance

13:45.955 --> 13:47.217
that lets you in.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.219
Oh.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.221
I think you just have to eat it.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.922
I don't care what it says
on the sign

13:55.965 --> 13:59.839
or the back of the ticket.
I paid to park my car.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.016
I have a right to expect
the place to have security.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.845
I have the right to expect
the place to be well-lit,

14:05.888 --> 14:07.281
to be safe.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.587
You don't get to opt out
of your responsibility

14:09.631 --> 14:12.329
just 'cause you put
some mumbo jumbo on a sign.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.550
This juror is acceptable

14:15.593 --> 14:16.986
to the defense,
Your Honor.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.815
Now if we can just get four
or five more like him.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.557
Are you the respondent
in this removal proceeding,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.559
Gabriel Almonte?

14:24.602 --> 14:25.908
Yes, I am, Your Honor.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.127
Will you be needing
a translator?

14:27.170 --> 14:29.085
No, Your Honor.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.913
JUDGE: Mr. Almonte,
you're accused

14:30.957 --> 14:32.872
of being an undocumented alien
living in the United States.

14:32.915 --> 14:33.960
Do you understand that?

14:34.003 --> 14:35.700
I do.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.354
This is an immigration court,

14:37.398 --> 14:39.922
and, as such, there is no right
to a court-appointed attorney.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.882
Do you have representation?

14:42.925 --> 14:45.362
No, Your Honor, I do not.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.494
Would you like to present
a defense

14:46.537 --> 14:47.843
before I rule on your removal?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.976
Excuse me?

14:50.019 --> 14:52.456
It seems as if you've
already made up your mind.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.894
You already know you want
to send me back, right?Mr. Almonte,

14:54.937 --> 14:57.026
unless you have proof
of citizenship

14:57.070 --> 14:58.506
or a defense against removal,

14:58.549 --> 15:01.988
then, yes, I'm ready
to rule right now.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.859
[door opens]

15:03.903 --> 15:07.863
Oh. My apologies, Your Honor.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.953
Coming from another case
at the courthouse across town.

15:10.997 --> 15:15.088
Uh, Benjamin Colón,
representing Gabriel Almonte.

15:15.131 --> 15:16.916
Mr. Colón, I was just
asking your client,

15:16.959 --> 15:19.570
who apparently didn't
know he had a lawyer,

15:19.614 --> 15:20.963
if he would be presenting
a defense

15:21.007 --> 15:22.617
to the accusations against him.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.967
Yes, Your Honor.
Well, we will be filing

15:25.011 --> 15:27.491
an application for asylum.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.450
It is our position
that my client

15:29.493 --> 15:31.495
should not be removed
from this country.

15:31.539 --> 15:34.716
Okay. To the issue of bond.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.370
Mr. Duncan?

15:36.413 --> 15:40.635
Your Honor, Gabriel Almonte is,
in our opinion, a flight risk.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.115
He was picked up
at Port Authority

15:42.158 --> 15:43.986
attempting to run

15:44.030 --> 15:46.510
and should not receive bond
under any circumstances.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.121
Mr. Colón?

15:48.164 --> 15:50.950
Gabriel Almonte has been in the
United States for seven years

15:50.993 --> 15:52.995
and has no criminal record.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.041
He eagerly looks forward
to arguing his case

15:55.084 --> 15:57.391
in front of this court,
Your Honor.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.959
Considering
the current overcrowding

16:00.002 --> 16:03.484
in our detention center,
bond is set at $10,000.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.922
The merit hearing will
begin tomorrow morning.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.012
I do hope you're not wasting
this court's time, Mr. Colón.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.188
Thanks so much for rushing over.

16:12.232 --> 16:15.235
[exhales] I'm just glad I could
get here in time to secure bond.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.106
All these judges want to do

16:17.150 --> 16:19.500
is blast through as many cases
as they can,

16:19.543 --> 16:22.068
and it's a lot easier to do
without a lawyer standing there.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.157
Listen, thank you.
Thank you so much.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.115
I'm Gabriel.Ah.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.900
Benjamin Colón.
Saw you at Cable's funeral.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.902
We work together, obviously.

16:30.946 --> 16:35.037
And both of you,
thank you for the bond money.

16:35.081 --> 16:38.171
Okay? I just... [sighs]

16:38.214 --> 16:40.042
Well, you probably want
to thank Dr. Bull for that,

16:40.086 --> 16:42.784
even though I'm sure he probably
doesn't know about it yet.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.569
Then let him know, please,
I'll-I'll pay him back somehow,

16:45.613 --> 16:47.136
some way.Will do.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.138
Now, here's what
I need you to do.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.054
I need you to go home
and put a list together for me

16:52.098 --> 16:54.752
of people who are willing
to testify on your behalf,

16:54.796 --> 16:56.537
talk about why
you should receive asylum

16:56.580 --> 16:58.539
and be allowed to stay.Yeah.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.932
Okay, I-I can do that. Sure.Great, great.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.979
I got to run, but the two
of you have your homework.

17:06.503 --> 17:09.028
Ah, nice to see you.

17:09.071 --> 17:12.857
You do know
it's almost 10:00 at night?

17:12.901 --> 17:14.946
Believe me, I'm well aware.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.036
I just, I need to use
our computers and databases

17:17.079 --> 17:19.038
to try and track down
some names Gabriel gave me,

17:19.081 --> 17:21.866
people who can hopefully testify
in less than 12 hours.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.869
That's very inspiring,
Ms. James. Nothing I like better

17:24.913 --> 17:27.089
than a "snowball's chance
in hell" story.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.442
I'm sorry.

17:32.486 --> 17:35.228
It's late,
and I'm old and cranky.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.361
No, you're not.
You're just too tired to lie.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.060
And too smart
not to know better.

17:44.541 --> 17:47.414
What do you really think
his chances are?

17:49.459 --> 17:51.461
The awful truth?

17:51.505 --> 17:54.116
Your friend picked
a terrible moment

17:54.160 --> 17:56.162
in the history of this country
to be from someplace else.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.382
But... you never know.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.819
Desperate times call
for desperate measures,

18:01.863 --> 18:04.300
and this country was founded
by desperate people,

18:04.344 --> 18:06.563
so who knows?

18:08.609 --> 18:11.612
You're right. Who knows?

18:25.365 --> 18:27.976
I was just sitting there,
enjoying dinner with my wife,

18:28.019 --> 18:30.848
and then suddenly I started
having trouble breathing.

18:30.892 --> 18:34.504
Just couldn't
catch my breath.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.550
And then my chest
started to hurt,

18:36.593 --> 18:38.856
and I guess I blacked out.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.381
And when you regained
consciousness?

18:41.424 --> 18:44.297
That guy was
standing over me.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.300
Found out later
I had a collapsed lung.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.737
He was the only one
who knew what to do.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.218
The guy saved my life.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.307
If it weren't for him,

18:54.350 --> 18:56.831
I'd have never seen
my wife or kids again.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.746
My oldest daughter's

18:58.789 --> 19:00.748
expecting her first child.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.706
Thanks to him,

19:02.750 --> 19:05.405
I'll get to meet my grandson.

19:05.448 --> 19:09.191
BENNY: No further questions,
Your Honor. Thank you.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.586
BULL: Judge never made eye
contact with Gabriel, not once.

19:12.629 --> 19:16.590
No change in posture
or facial expression.

19:16.633 --> 19:19.549
[sighs] I don't think we've done
anything to change his mind.

19:19.593 --> 19:23.597
Hmm. I'm not sure changing
his mind is even on the menu.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.165
Guys like Wentworth,
I've seen them before.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.949
He's dug in.

19:27.992 --> 19:30.734
Prides himself on being
a law and order man.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.867
Likes to brag
at cocktail parties

19:32.910 --> 19:35.304
about being appointed
by the Department of Justice.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.306
They don't listen to anybody.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.003
Not even one of their own?

19:42.398 --> 19:43.617
CLAUDINE:
I spoke to Melanie

19:43.660 --> 19:45.445
the day after she came back
from the hospital.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.404
She made it very clear to me
that she had given the portrait

19:48.448 --> 19:50.450
to my brother.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.191
Even told me she was
going to contact the museum

19:52.234 --> 19:54.323
and amend her agreement
with them.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.456
Do you know why
she never amended

19:56.499 --> 19:57.805
her agreement with the museum?

19:57.848 --> 20:01.374
I have no idea. My guess is...

20:01.417 --> 20:03.767
she never got the chance.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.640
The final stage
of her cancer was so...

20:06.683 --> 20:08.642
aggressive.

20:08.685 --> 20:12.167
She was too weak to do much
of anything those last days.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.691
And then she was gone.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.174
No further questions.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.265
RIDENOUR:
Good morning, Ms. Schreiber.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.227
You're very close
to your brother, aren't you?

20:28.270 --> 20:30.272
Very, yes.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.232
And it's not as if
your brother has any children.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.452
No nephews or nieces
for you to fawn over?

20:36.496 --> 20:39.063
No, he has no children.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.501
And are there
any other siblings,

20:41.544 --> 20:43.851
or is it just you
and Mr. Schreiber?

20:43.894 --> 20:45.679
Just the two of us.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.463
So is it safe to assume

20:47.507 --> 20:49.944
his will names you
as his sole heir when he passes?[clears throat]

20:49.987 --> 20:52.860
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

20:52.903 --> 20:54.165
We're talking about a
$10 million portrait.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.298
Isn't who may end up
owning it relevant?

20:56.342 --> 20:59.562
Seems like a reasonable line
of questioning to me.

20:59.606 --> 21:00.998
Overruled.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.000
RIDENOUR:
So, again,

21:03.044 --> 21:04.741
is it safe to assume

21:04.785 --> 21:06.743
his will names you
as his sole heir when he passes?

21:06.787 --> 21:08.832
That you will, in fact,
inherit the portrait

21:08.876 --> 21:11.531
when and if your brother
should pass before you?

21:11.574 --> 21:14.447
It's not something
we talk about, but...

21:14.490 --> 21:16.753
I-I suspect that's true.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.103
RIDENOUR:
No further questions.

21:20.888 --> 21:23.978
Feels like our boat's
taking on water, Chunk.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.980
You don't have to tell me.
I'm right here in it.

21:26.023 --> 21:28.765
I've got the waterlogged
shoes to prove it.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.203
[quietly]:
Look at me.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.336
I know you've testified
tons of times.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.772
Not for a friend.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.600
Not when his life
is on the line.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.428
All the more reason
to pay careful attention

21:39.472 --> 21:40.603
to what you're gonna say.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.213
Oh, I know what I'm gonna say.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.954
I'm gonna ask that judge
how he sleeps

21:43.998 --> 21:46.609
knowing he's sending people
to certain death.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.132
Um, yeah, well,

21:48.176 --> 21:50.874
I would urge you
to rethink that, Danny.

21:50.918 --> 21:53.224
I'm putting you on the stand
'cause you're ex-FBI.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.965
I'm hoping the judge
looks at you and thinks,

21:55.009 --> 21:56.793
"Oh, she's one of us."

21:56.837 --> 21:58.752
But you go in there
and lecture him,

21:58.795 --> 22:00.275
game over.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.930
We're all going home,
and Gabriel's in a C-130,

22:02.973 --> 22:05.149
on his way to a
firing squad by sundown.

22:05.193 --> 22:08.022
So let's take that anger
and put it somewhere else.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.851
You want to make
that judge understand

22:10.894 --> 22:12.156
why Gabriel
should be here,

22:12.200 --> 22:16.465
not shame him for wanting
to send him away.

22:16.509 --> 22:17.901
[sighs]

22:17.945 --> 22:19.816
You need to go in there

22:19.860 --> 22:22.036
and be that man's advocate.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.690
Tell his story.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.431
Talk about what makes him
special--

22:25.474 --> 22:26.997
not what the judge
can do for Gabriel

22:27.041 --> 22:28.521
but what Gabriel can do for us,

22:28.564 --> 22:30.305
for this country,

22:30.349 --> 22:32.568
all of us already here.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.266
BENNY:
When you met

22:35.310 --> 22:36.659
Gabriel Almonte,

22:36.703 --> 22:38.922
what was your first impression
of him?

22:38.966 --> 22:41.925
As a field agent for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation,

22:41.969 --> 22:44.885
it was my job to be
a good judge of character.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.061
I needed to be able
to distinguish people

22:47.104 --> 22:48.802
who were authentic assets

22:48.845 --> 22:49.977
from people who were not,

22:50.020 --> 22:51.413
to be able to see
a person's essence,

22:51.457 --> 22:52.936
even if they didn't want me
to see it.

22:57.593 --> 23:01.423
I'd like to share
a little story, if I may.

23:02.772 --> 23:05.253
I was out to dinner
with my new friend Gabriel.

23:05.296 --> 23:08.604
It was... maybe the second time
we'd shared a meal together.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.780
And... I did not know

23:10.824 --> 23:13.870
that he was a heart surgeon
in his native country.

23:13.914 --> 23:17.004
I did not know
he was here illegally.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.223
I did not know
anything.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.225
He was almost invisible.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.706
Cute, funny,

23:23.750 --> 23:25.795
good company.

23:25.839 --> 23:27.406
But, quite honestly,

23:27.449 --> 23:30.409
nothing exceptional.

23:30.452 --> 23:34.108
Little did I know
that was the way he wanted it.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.766
He needed to hide
his fierce intellect.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.507
He needed to disguise

23:41.550 --> 23:43.030
his superior
education.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.945
So, that night at the
restaurant, when the man

23:44.988 --> 23:46.033
next to us
could no longer breathe,

23:46.076 --> 23:47.948
Gabriel had a tough choice
to make.

23:47.991 --> 23:49.950
He knew instantly
what was wrong.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.125
He knew instantly
what to do.

23:51.168 --> 23:52.256
But...

23:52.300 --> 23:55.042
he also knew, in doing it,

23:55.085 --> 23:57.044
in getting up
and exposing himself

23:57.087 --> 23:58.959
as somebody who knows his
way around the human body

23:59.002 --> 24:00.700
in that high-profile
restaurant,

24:00.743 --> 24:02.136
was sure to get
him in trouble.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.007
And it did.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.922
With me...
[chuckles]

24:05.966 --> 24:08.490
and the government.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.927
We all felt
we'd been duped a little.

24:11.972 --> 24:13.539
But here's the point.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.497
Here's-here's what
I need you to know.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.109
That almost invisible man

24:19.153 --> 24:21.590
didn't hesitate for a second.

24:21.634 --> 24:24.811
He understood that,
in that moment,

24:24.854 --> 24:27.422
the virtual certainty
of that man's death

24:27.466 --> 24:30.033
mattered more than the illusion

24:30.077 --> 24:32.035
that his life depended on.

24:32.079 --> 24:35.430
So he did what we hope
every good neighbor,

24:35.474 --> 24:37.650
every good citizen will do.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.652
[chuckles softly]

24:41.958 --> 24:44.961
And now I'd like you to imagine

24:45.005 --> 24:47.311
how much better
all our lives might be

24:47.355 --> 24:48.965
if he were allowed
to be visible,

24:49.009 --> 24:51.794
to be as smart
as he truly is,

24:51.838 --> 24:54.797
if he were able to offer
this country,

24:54.841 --> 24:55.929
my country,

24:55.972 --> 24:58.627
our country, his best,

24:58.671 --> 25:00.803
instead of hiding in the shadows

25:00.847 --> 25:03.240
and pleading for
the most basic of human rights,

25:03.284 --> 25:05.286
the right to stay alive.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.332
I'm... [chuckles]
I'm sorry.

25:08.376 --> 25:09.725
Did I answer your question?

25:09.769 --> 25:11.945
You sure did.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.164
No further questions,
Your Honor.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.472
You're a former FBI agent,

25:17.516 --> 25:19.039
so let me ask you
a simple question.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.911
Do you believe
Mr. Almonte understands the law?

25:22.956 --> 25:24.174
I'm sorry,

25:24.218 --> 25:25.567
you want me to speculate
on what someone does

25:25.611 --> 25:26.655
or doesn't understand?

25:26.699 --> 25:28.265
You just said he was brilliant.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.093
All kinds of education.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.268
A doctor.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.966
Stands to reason
he probably knew

25:33.009 --> 25:35.185
he was breaking
the law, right?

25:35.229 --> 25:37.579
Again, I don't think
it's my place to...Well,

25:37.623 --> 25:39.755
wh-what about you?
You think he broke the law?

25:41.801 --> 25:43.280
Like I said,

25:43.324 --> 25:46.588
I think he's a human being
trying to stay alive.

25:46.632 --> 25:47.894
That's not what I asked,
Ms. James.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.594
The witness will answer
the question.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.030
That's all right.
I'll withdraw it.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.076
Thank you,
Ms. James.

25:58.121 --> 26:00.123
Sit back down.
You have not been excused.

26:01.168 --> 26:04.127
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.868
I'd like an answer
to the question.

26:05.912 --> 26:08.392
As a former
law enforcement officer,

26:08.436 --> 26:10.917
did Gabriel Almonte
break the law?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.397
A simple yes or no.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.275
I'm waiting for an answer,
Ms. James.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.673
Yes, Your Honor.
He broke the law.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.501
The laws of the very country
he's asking to take him in.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.678
Why should

26:32.721 --> 26:35.115
we welcome someone in,
no matter what he has to offer,

26:35.158 --> 26:38.814
if he's already proven he's
unwilling to follow our laws?

26:38.858 --> 26:40.163
Objection, Your Honor.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.122
Now, we all understand

26:42.165 --> 26:43.950
that this is
a passionate debate...

26:43.993 --> 26:44.994
Who are you
objecting to,

26:45.038 --> 26:45.995
Mr. Colón?

26:46.039 --> 26:48.041
Me? My passion?

26:48.084 --> 26:49.085
Overruled.

26:50.696 --> 26:53.002
Why is it so difficult
for people to understand

26:53.046 --> 26:54.743
that if we don't uphold
our laws,

26:54.787 --> 26:58.007
then we maintain
no sense of country at all?

26:58.051 --> 26:59.443
Now you're excused, Ms. James.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.663
I'm ready to rule.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.491
Your Honor,
if it pleases the court,

27:03.534 --> 27:06.581
we have one more witness
that will be available tomorrow.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.979
Is this man a part of your team,
Mr. Colón?

27:13.022 --> 27:14.241
Does he speak
for you?

27:14.284 --> 27:16.156
Uh, yes, he does,
Your Honor.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.506
Fine.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.248
I already have something
scheduled in the morning.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.250
Your witness will
testify tomorrow

27:23.293 --> 27:24.817
right after lunch,

27:24.860 --> 27:26.427
and then I'll offer my judgment.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.472
Court dismissed.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.346
[quietly]:
And who is this mystery witness?

27:33.390 --> 27:34.914
I have no idea.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.742
But now everybody lives
to see another day,

27:36.785 --> 27:38.265
and that certainly beats
the alternative.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.402
MARISSA: There's got to be
someone we can put on the stand,

27:45.446 --> 27:47.970
someone who can make
that judge see.

27:48.014 --> 27:50.494
Judge can't see,
'cause he isn't looking.

27:50.538 --> 27:53.628
There's only two things
he wants:

27:53.672 --> 27:56.587
to deport Gabriel
and get on to his next case.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.894
[sighs] You know,

27:58.938 --> 28:00.287
when he first decided
to move here,

28:00.330 --> 28:03.159
he-he thought he was doing
all the right things.

28:03.203 --> 28:07.207
He hired this lawyer
that promised him the world.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.817
The proper papers,

28:08.861 --> 28:10.514
recertification
as a doctor.

28:10.558 --> 28:13.692
Gabriel gave him
every cent he had.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.694
But when he showed up
at the airport,

28:15.737 --> 28:20.046
all that was waiting for him
was a two-week tourist visa.

28:21.264 --> 28:24.659
Maybe there are other people
this lawyer scammed.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.269
Maybe if...

28:26.313 --> 28:28.184
if we could find one of them...

28:28.228 --> 28:30.099
That's not gonna work.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.188
You have to be a U.S. citizen

28:32.232 --> 28:34.756
to testify
in immigration court.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.976
Now, if you could find
that lawyer...

28:37.019 --> 28:39.239
In 13 hours?

28:39.282 --> 28:41.415
Who are we kidding?
It doesn't matter.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.070
Wentworth doesn't care
what happened to Gabriel.

28:44.113 --> 28:45.811
He has a job to do,

28:45.854 --> 28:47.638
and he wants to get it done.

28:47.682 --> 28:48.857
BENNY:
Well,

28:48.901 --> 28:51.207
in the meantime,
I'll start putting together

28:51.251 --> 28:52.426
the paperwork for an appeal.

28:52.469 --> 28:54.602
But... [grunts]
without any new information,

28:54.645 --> 28:56.169
we are likely to be denied.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.998
[sighs] And, of
course, we'd have

28:59.041 --> 28:59.999
to get him back here,

29:00.042 --> 29:02.131
and he'd have
to find a way to...

29:02.175 --> 29:04.612
avoid authorities
in his home country

29:04.655 --> 29:06.657
until we schedule
the hearings.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.659
Lots of ifs.

29:08.703 --> 29:11.401
We found some good news.

29:12.533 --> 29:13.664
Unless, of course,

29:13.708 --> 29:15.231
that isn't what y'all
are looking for.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.494
We'll take all the
good news we can get.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.888
I was able to access Melanie's
cellular records to see

29:19.932 --> 29:21.890
who she might have spoken with
the week before she died.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.849
She found a witness,

29:23.892 --> 29:25.241
a woman that works
in a custom frame house.

29:25.285 --> 29:26.721
TAYLOR:
A place that's done a lot

29:26.765 --> 29:29.071
of business with Geoffrey's
ex-wife over the years.

29:29.115 --> 29:31.421
She's willing to testify
first thing in the morning.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.293
[knocking]

29:33.336 --> 29:34.468
Who is it?

29:34.511 --> 29:36.339
DANNY: It's me.[exhales]

29:36.383 --> 29:37.819
I've been calling
and texting you all night,

29:37.863 --> 29:39.603
and you haven't answered me,
so I just...

29:39.647 --> 29:41.170
want to make sure
you're okay.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.781
Yeah, I'm okay.
[sniffles]

29:42.824 --> 29:44.783
I'm okay.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.177
You should just go away.

29:48.221 --> 29:51.267
I think that this is all going
to be easier for me tomorrow

29:51.311 --> 29:52.225
if you're not there.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.793
Okay?

29:55.881 --> 29:57.056
I just,

29:57.099 --> 29:59.406
I don't want you
to see them take me away.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.060
[sighs]

30:01.103 --> 30:03.932
[keys jangle, lock clicks]

30:05.194 --> 30:06.587
[sighs]

30:06.630 --> 30:08.328
Gabriel,

30:08.371 --> 30:10.896
will you please come over here
and unhook this door?

30:10.939 --> 30:12.898
Go away, please, Danny.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.551
Please, just go away.

30:14.595 --> 30:17.206
You and your friends have done
everything that you can for me.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.077
Okay? Thank you.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.079
But we're not done.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.255
Yeah, I think that we are.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.344
I'm not stupid.

30:24.387 --> 30:25.867
You understand?
I'm not stupid.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.347
That place is not a court.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.349
That is a checkpoint.

30:29.392 --> 30:30.872
By this time tomorrow,

30:30.916 --> 30:32.265
I'm either going to be dead

30:32.308 --> 30:34.745
or in a cell waiting to die.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.138
No, you won't.

30:36.182 --> 30:39.881
Just please come to the door.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.492
Please?

30:42.536 --> 30:44.059
[sighs]

30:44.103 --> 30:46.061
Look, I have an idea.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.672
I just, I need
to tell you to your face.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.719
[sighs]

30:52.720 --> 30:54.330
[sniffles]

31:02.469 --> 31:05.689
You're not going to invite me
out to dinner again, are you?

31:05.733 --> 31:08.040
Let's get married.

31:08.083 --> 31:11.173
City Hall opens at 8:30.

31:11.217 --> 31:14.002
Court's not back
until after lunch.

31:14.046 --> 31:17.701

on a path to citizenship.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.835
You're serious.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.228
Of course I'm serious.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.447
Do I look like I'm kidding?

31:39.288 --> 31:42.291
You really sure
you want to do this?

31:51.431 --> 31:53.694
[Danny sighs]

31:53.737 --> 31:56.175
As soon as we're married,
we'll file for a marriage visa.

31:56.218 --> 31:59.134
Judge Wentworth will have to
suspend the removal hearing

31:59.178 --> 32:00.744
and the immigration officials
will investigate our marriage.

32:00.788 --> 32:02.964
Oh, man. [sighs]

32:03.008 --> 32:04.966
What?

32:05.010 --> 32:07.621
I know about this.

32:07.664 --> 32:12.191
I heard about this undocumented
guy who got married.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.280
He and his wife had been
together for years.

32:14.323 --> 32:16.325
They still,
still separated them

32:16.369 --> 32:17.979
and interviewed them for hours.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.676
Uh...

32:19.720 --> 32:21.678
How are you going
to handle your finances?

32:21.722 --> 32:23.985
What do you feel about
each other's in-laws?

32:24.029 --> 32:26.640
What's each other's
favorite food?

32:26.683 --> 32:28.468
Danny, I don't, I don't know
your favorite food.

32:28.511 --> 32:29.948
I've never met your parents.

32:29.991 --> 32:33.647
You've got to stop
thinking this way.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.866
And we have to stop having
this conversation here.

32:35.910 --> 32:38.478
Look...

32:38.521 --> 32:42.047
If they don't give us
the marriage license,

32:42.090 --> 32:44.614
go back to your country
for a few months.
[sighs]

32:44.658 --> 32:46.965

radar and survive.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.013

Number 22.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.715
Okay.
Come on.

33:01.066 --> 33:05.679
Hi. Uh, we, uh,
need a marriage license.

33:05.722 --> 33:08.029
I need I.D. from
each of you.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.423
Uh, yeah, of course.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.995
There you go.
Mm-hmm.

Hmm. Danielle James.

33:18.735 --> 33:20.346

33:20.389 --> 33:22.435
And Gabriel Almonte.

33:22.478 --> 33:27.135
NYC Municipal I.D. card.

33:34.708 --> 33:37.015
Well, this all looks good.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.627
You are good to go.

33:40.670 --> 33:44.109
Once the 24-hour waiting period
is up, you're free to marry.

33:44.152 --> 33:46.285
I'm sorry. We... [laughs]
We can't wait 24 hours.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.852
We have to get married today,
this morning.

33:48.896 --> 33:52.073
Well, that's not how it works
in the state of New York.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.206
There's a 24-hour
waiting period.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.338
If it's an emergency,
you could try

33:56.382 --> 33:58.123
and get a judicial waiver,

33:58.166 --> 34:00.951
but I wouldn't even know how
to tell you where to start.

34:03.215 --> 34:08.046
Look, it seems like forever,
but it isn't.

34:08.089 --> 34:11.005
Number 23!

34:11.049 --> 34:14.182
And what was the nature
of Melanie's business

34:14.226 --> 34:16.271
the last time she came
to your custom frame house?

34:16.315 --> 34:19.231
She said she wanted
a new frame made

34:19.274 --> 34:21.320
for a Cole Trumaine she owned.

34:21.363 --> 34:23.235
She said it was
a portrait of her

34:23.278 --> 34:25.324
that was commissioned shortly
before she was married.

34:25.367 --> 34:29.284
Apparently, her husband never
really liked the gold leaf frame

34:29.328 --> 34:31.939
the portrait was originally
mounted in.

34:31.982 --> 34:36.074
She said Geoffrey preferred more
of a sleek, black, modern style.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.119
Uh, she was giving it
to him as a gift,

34:38.163 --> 34:39.860
and she was very particular.

34:39.903 --> 34:43.211
She wanted to make sure that
everything was done just right.

34:43.255 --> 34:47.172
And did any money change hands
the day she came to see you?

34:47.215 --> 34:50.436
Yes. I prepared the work order
and she gave me a deposit.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.655
I was waiting for her
to let me know

34:52.699 --> 34:54.614
when I could pick the piece up,

34:54.657 --> 34:57.530
but I-I'm guessing that's when
she took a turn for the worse,

34:57.573 --> 35:00.228
because I never heard from her.MACINTYRE: Thank you.

35:00.272 --> 35:02.143
One last thing.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.754
Did she happen to specify
where you were

35:04.798 --> 35:07.148
to deliver the piece
once your work was completed?

35:07.192 --> 35:10.630
Or were you simply gonna
return it to her home?

35:10.673 --> 35:12.371
No. She was very clear.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.155
The portrait was to be delivered

35:14.199 --> 35:15.765
to Geoffrey Schreiber's
residence.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.943
MACINTYRE:

into evidence

35:24.948 --> 35:27.777

35:27.821 --> 35:30.998
The court will note
Geoffrey Schreiber's address

35:31.041 --> 35:32.869
indicated as the
"delivery" address.

35:32.913 --> 35:34.654
Additionally,
the court will note

35:34.697 --> 35:36.351
the signature
of Melanie Schreiber.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.921
So entered.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.970
Well, uh, enjoy Germany.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.451

is gonna love it there.

both enough.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.759

win and run

35:52.802 --> 35:54.456
but I've got another
case I need to get to.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.720
And I fear the outcome is not
gonna be what we want it to be.

35:57.764 --> 36:00.419
I know this sounds
ridiculously hollow,

36:00.462 --> 36:02.943

I can do for you,

please don't hesitate to ask.

Okay, so...

36:37.804 --> 36:39.936

What happens now?

36:39.980 --> 36:42.243
I just left Judge Wentworth.

36:42.287 --> 36:45.420
With his permission, I went
ahead and made arrangements

36:45.464 --> 36:47.640
for you to voluntarily deport.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.337
That way there's
no guards.

36:49.381 --> 36:50.817
There's no cuffs.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.297
It's all very civilized.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.474

a half hours,

you through security.
