WEBVTT

00:04.462 --> 00:07.256
Mm, mm, mm.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.383
This cake is amazing. Mm.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.510
My God, get a room.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.388
Mm.
I would get a room with this cake.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.765
I think I could show
this cake a good time.

00:18.143 --> 00:21.311
If you had to, what would
you give up, food or sex?

00:21.479 --> 00:23.564
Sex.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.692
Seriously, answer faster.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.902
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

00:29.070 --> 00:33.615
No, when she said "sex," I wasn't
thinking about sex with you, heh.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.244
It's like a giant hug.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.457
Ross, how about you?
Which would you give up, sex or food?

00:41.624 --> 00:44.418
- Food.
- Okay, how about, um, sex or dinosaurs?

00:49.549 --> 00:53.052
Oh, my God, it's like Sophie's Choice.

00:53.720 --> 00:54.762
Oh, God.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.681
What about you, Joe?
What would you give up, sex or food?

00:57.849 --> 01:00.392
Uh... Ooh... Uh...

01:01.811 --> 01:03.562
I don't know, it's too hard.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.981
No, you gotta pick one.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.234
Uh, food. No, sex.

01:09.402 --> 01:13.197
Food. Sex. Food. Sex...
I don't know. Oh, God, I want both.

01:13.364 --> 01:16.075
I want... I want girls on bread.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.703
- You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
- Oh, how cute.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.290
- Oh, she looks just like a little doll.
- Oh, no, that is a doll.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.252
Oh, thank God,
because that thing's really creepy.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.502
Yeah.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.006
Look, there's Chandler.

02:13.174 --> 02:15.175
Oh, who's the blond? She's pretty.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.928
He's having an affair.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.097
He is not having an affair.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.224
I'm always right about these things.

02:22.392 --> 02:26.061
No, you're not. Last week,
you thought Ross was trying to kill you.

02:26.229 --> 02:30.149
Well, sorry, but it's hard to believe
that anyone would tell a story that dull...

02:30.316 --> 02:32.234
...just to tell it.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.696
There's something going on with them.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.865
Look. He's getting into the car with her.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.658
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.451
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.036
Huh?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.873
- Okay, duck down.
- Oh.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.379
- Hello?
- Oh, hi. It's Phoebe.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.965
Um, I know that Monica
is working today...

02:55.133 --> 02:58.677
...so I was wondering if you wanted to
come to the movies with me and Rachel.

02:59.220 --> 03:03.932
Oh, uh, I have to work too.
Yeah, I'm stuck here at the office all day.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.605
Uh, well, it's a shame
that you'll miss the movie...

03:09.772 --> 03:15.527
...because we were gonna see,
you know, either, um, Liar Liar or, um...

03:15.695 --> 03:20.699
...Betrayal or An Affair to Remember.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.285
Those are all really old.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.538
Okay, then maybe it'll be, um...

03:26.706 --> 03:28.457
Dude, Where's My Car?

03:29.292 --> 03:32.044
- What?
- They're in a car.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.381
Okay. Well, talk to you later,
okay? Bye.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.091
Jeez.

03:38.259 --> 03:41.011
Okay, quick. We gotta find a cab
and follow them.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.221
Oh, yeah, okay.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.432
Let me just grab my night-vision goggles
and my stun gun. Heh.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.893
I got them.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.858
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.361
Hey, you smell like
perfume and cigarettes.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.155
- I was in the car with Nancy.
- Nancy doesn't smoke.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.492
Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
Be thankful for that.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.788
So... What did you think
of the house?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.915
It's everything we've been looking for.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.793
Isn't it? And what about
the amazing wainscoting...

04:12.961 --> 04:15.712
...the crown molding
and the dormer windows in the attic?

04:15.880 --> 04:18.214
And the wiggle woms
and the zip zorps.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.677
What were the things you said?

04:21.844 --> 04:24.805
- Don't you love the huge yard?
- The fireplace in the bedroom.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.974
And Nancy said it's really underpriced...

04:27.141 --> 04:31.103
...because the guy lost his job
and has to move in with his parents!

04:31.271 --> 04:34.106
This is bringing out
a lovely color in you.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.567
So do you think we should get it?

04:37.735 --> 04:39.278
I don't know. What do you think?

04:39.445 --> 04:40.862
- I think we should.
- I do too.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.155
- This is huge.
- I know.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.699
How bad
do you wanna smoke now?

04:43.866 --> 04:46.868
I don't know what you mean,
giant, talking cigarette.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.497
Phoebe called as I was getting
into Nancy's car.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.624
If she asks you, I was at work all day.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.626
Got you. When do we tell them?

04:54.794 --> 04:58.422
We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.
Why upset everybody over nothing?

04:58.589 --> 04:59.965
Okay. Right.

05:00.133 --> 05:05.178
- Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
- I know. Good luck with it.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.975
I just can't see Chandler cheating.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.687
I'm telling you guys, we followed
them out to a house in Westchester.

05:13.855 --> 05:18.525
They went in for 45 minutes, and then
they came out looking pretty happy.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.862
- Chandler?
Mm-hm.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.530
Forty-five minutes?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.367
Well, something's not right.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.787
I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.789
I know, and with the baby coming?

05:32.957 --> 05:34.791
- So should we tell her?
- I don't know.

05:36.044 --> 05:39.629
If one of us saw Mike with another
woman, would you want us to tell you?

05:39.797 --> 05:42.090
Why? Who'd you see him with?

05:42.258 --> 05:44.801
- No one. I'm just saying if we did...
- Tell me what you know!

05:46.596 --> 05:50.140
No one. Nothing. Mike's a great guy.
It was hypothetical.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.810
All right. He is a good guy.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.812
You're right. He wouldn't cheat.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.565
If I did see him with someone,
there's no way I...

05:58.733 --> 05:59.775
Who did you see him with?

06:14.832 --> 06:17.667
Oh, look at her. So happy.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.508
If only there were a smaller one
to clean this one.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.221
Hey, is, uh... Is Chandler here?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.640
No, he's picking up dinner.
Why, what's up?

06:33.017 --> 06:34.559
Well...

06:35.812 --> 06:39.481
Look, whatever happens,
we're here for you and we love you.

06:41.234 --> 06:45.028
- All right.
- Chandler might be having an affair.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.948
- What?
- Phoebe and I saw Chandler...

06:48.116 --> 06:51.368
...with a blond woman today
outside on the street.

06:51.536 --> 06:55.038
And then we followed them
to a house in Westchester.

06:55.206 --> 06:58.708
They went in together. I'm so sorry.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.756
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.302
What did you think of the house?

07:12.515 --> 07:13.932
What?

07:14.142 --> 07:16.560
Monica, you understand
what we're saying, right?

07:16.727 --> 07:21.565
Yeah. Sure. I mean,
I'm devastated, obviously.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.402
Did you think the neighborhood
was homey?

07:26.988 --> 07:30.198
- Hey.
- You son of a bitch.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.911
Is it me, or have the greetings
gone downhill around here?

07:35.746 --> 07:38.123
Phoebe and Rachel
saw you with Nancy today.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.543
And, um,
they think you're having an affair.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.503
- Who's Nancy?
- What's going on?

07:43.671 --> 07:44.796
Uh...

07:44.964 --> 07:46.798
Okay, uh...

07:46.966 --> 07:48.467
All right, you better sit down.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.344
- This is... This is pretty big.
- Yeah.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.224
I'm not having an affair.

07:56.392 --> 08:00.562
Nancy is our realtor.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.732
I knew he couldn't be with a woman
for 45 minutes.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.696
Why do you have a realtor?

08:09.864 --> 08:13.074
Um, she's been showing us houses
outside of the city.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.037
- What?
- Are you serious?

08:17.205 --> 08:19.831
When we found out
that we were gonna get this baby...

08:19.999 --> 08:23.293
...Chandler and I decided
we didn't wanna raise a kid in the city.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.378
So you're... So you're gonna move?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.506
Oh, my God.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.926
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?

08:32.303 --> 08:34.804
What is wrong with raising a kid
in the city?

08:34.972 --> 08:37.182
I'm doing it. Ross is doing it.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.352
Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.272
And that's great for you guys,
but we want a lawn and a swing set.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.691
A street where our kids
can ride their bikes...

08:46.859 --> 08:48.944
...and maybe an ice-cream truck
can go by.

08:49.111 --> 08:52.072
So you wanna buy a house
in the '50s.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.534
Have you thought about
what you're giving up?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.869
You can't move out of the city.
What if...?

08:58.037 --> 09:00.121
What if you want Chinese food
at 5 a. M?

09:00.289 --> 09:03.124
Or a fake Rolex that breaks
as soon as it rains?

09:03.292 --> 09:06.670
Or an Asian hooker
sent right to your door?

09:08.047 --> 09:11.299
You know what? If you want to look
for a house, that's okay.

09:11.467 --> 09:15.178
No. No, it's not. Don't listen to him.
I'm gonna thump you.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.683
It's okay, because they have
to get it out of their system.

09:20.142 --> 09:24.854
Okay? But you're gonna realize
this is the only place you wanna be.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.775
Actually...

09:28.943 --> 09:30.735
...we already found a house we love.

09:30.903 --> 09:35.323
- What?
- About an hour ago, we made an offer.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.374
Bet you wish I was
having an affair now, huh?

09:50.631 --> 09:54.301
- You put an offer on a house?
- It's so sweet.

09:54.468 --> 09:57.762
It really is. It has this big yard
that leads down to this stream.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.889
And then there's these old maple trees.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.726
Oh, again with the nature.
What are you, beavers?

10:03.311 --> 10:06.021
Look, I know this is really hard,
and we're really sorry.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.524
Is this because I come over here
without knocking and eat your food?

10:09.692 --> 10:11.860
Because I can stop doing that.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.404
I really, really think I can.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.990
You know that's not the reason, Joe.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.248
I think if you saw it, you'd understand.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.709
You guys were there.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

10:31.088 --> 10:33.006
- Yeah, it is.
- What the hell are you doing?

10:33.174 --> 10:37.010
Well, it is, all right? When we were
out there today, all I kept thinking was:

10:37.178 --> 10:39.554
"I can't believe Chandler is
screwing this woman...

10:39.722 --> 10:42.057
...but, man, this would be
a nice place to live."

10:42.725 --> 10:44.351
Yeah, but so is this.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.562
Yeah. I mean, if you move there,
you have to leave here.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.231
I mean, how can you leave this place?

10:53.694 --> 10:55.737
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

10:55.988 --> 10:59.699
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!

10:59.867 --> 11:02.410
You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

11:02.578 --> 11:05.580
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

11:05.748 --> 11:08.333
What if I wanna be a purse?
You know?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.169
Or a hat?"

11:12.004 --> 11:14.339
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.966
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

11:18.511 --> 11:20.512
You can see where he'd have trouble.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.266
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.814
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.609
Your money's mine, Green.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.486
Your fly's open, Geller.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.823
You know what I just realized?

11:39.990 --> 11:43.243
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J."

11:45.204 --> 11:47.330
Coincidence?

11:47.498 --> 11:50.625
Hey, that's "jo-incidence" with a "C."

11:54.463 --> 11:58.842
Ooh, look. Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.721
Ooh.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.681
Oh!

12:04.849 --> 12:07.767
Ooh. That had to hurt.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.896
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.441
You know, instead of watching football,
you could help.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.526
We know.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.780
Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows
in concentric circles.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.908
No, you wanna put them
in concentric circles.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.578
I want to do this.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.547
Every year.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.177
It's stuck.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.636
Well...

12:43.804 --> 12:46.639
Step. How did it get on?

12:46.807 --> 12:49.726
I put it on to scare Chandler.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.354
Oh, my God!
Monica's gonna totally freak out.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.190
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

12:55.357 --> 13:00.445
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head inside a turkey's ass.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.323
Ooh, ooh. Monica.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.991
Ooh.

13:06.702 --> 13:10.747
Did you get the turkey...?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:11.123 --> 13:12.707
Who is that?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.417
It's Joey.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.544
I got it.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.339
How about if we win,
they have to get rid of the rooster.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.008
Ooh, that's interesting.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.260
If you win...

13:24.428 --> 13:26.721
...we give up the bird.
- Aah!

13:29.183 --> 13:31.059
But if we win...

13:31.227 --> 13:33.061
...we get your apartment.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.314
Ooh!

13:36.565 --> 13:38.191
- Deal!
- What?

13:39.151 --> 13:41.903
"What was Monica's nickname
when she was a field-hockey goalie?"

13:42.071 --> 13:44.072
- Big Fat Goalie.
- Correct.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.617
"Rachel claims
this is her favorite movie."

13:47.785 --> 13:49.202
- Dangerous Liaisons.
- Correct.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.831
- "Her actual favorite is?" Correct.
- Weekend at Bernie's.

13:53.999 --> 13:58.086
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

13:58.254 --> 13:59.587
- Okay, everyday use.
- Fancy.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.214
- Guest.
- Fancy guest.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.341
- Two seconds.
- Uh, 11?

14:04.718 --> 14:06.678
Eleven. Unbelievable.
Eleven is correct.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.471
- Yes!
Ha-ha-ha.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.599
"Chandler was how old
when he first touched a girl's breast?"

14:11.767 --> 14:13.059
- Fourteen?
- No, 19.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.811
Thanks, man.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.188
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.190
- His name was?"
- Maurice.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.234
- "His profession was?"
- Space cowboy!

14:21.402 --> 14:22.819
Correct.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.030
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

14:27.992 --> 14:29.033
Oh.

14:29.785 --> 14:30.827
Oh, gosh.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.620
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.914
It has something to do
with transponding.

14:35.082 --> 14:38.668
Oh! Oh! He's a transponster.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.879
That's not even a word!

14:41.714 --> 14:42.797
Oh, my God.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.926
- Oh, my God.
- No!

14:49.179 --> 14:50.263
Whoo!

14:51.682 --> 14:55.435
You know what? You are mean boys
who are just being mean.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.980
Hey, don't get mad at us.
No one forced you to raise the stakes.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.691
That is not true. She did. She forced me.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.444
We'd still be here if you hadn't
got the question wrong.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.946
Well, it was a stupid, unfair question!

15:07.114 --> 15:08.781
Don't blame the questions!

15:08.949 --> 15:11.034
Would you all stop yelling
in our apartment?

15:11.201 --> 15:14.454
You are ruining moving day for us.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.205
Chandler!

15:19.126 --> 15:22.211
Chandler, I saw what you were doing
through the window.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.548
I saw what you were doing to my sister.
Now, get out here!

15:26.050 --> 15:28.885
Well, listen, we had a good run.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.970
You know? What was it?
Four, five months?

15:31.138 --> 15:33.389
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.850
So goodbye, take care, bye-bye then.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.020
Hey, Ross. What's up, bro?

15:41.273 --> 15:45.234
What the hell are you doing?

15:45.444 --> 15:46.486
Hey, what's going on?

15:46.654 --> 15:50.740
Well, I think... I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.285
Dude, he's right there.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.248
I thought you were my best friend.
This is my sister.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.585
My best friend and my sister.
I cannot believe this.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.589
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.549
Okay? I'm in love with her.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.971
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

16:13.430 --> 16:17.016
I'm sorry, but it's true. I love him too.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.775
My best friend and my sister.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.072
I cannot believe this.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.325
This is the last box of your clothes.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.453
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

16:37.913 --> 16:42.500
Funny, I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.839
Okay, you guys, I don't mean
to make things worse, but...

16:48.007 --> 16:50.383
...I don't wanna live
with Rachel anymore.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.136
- What?
- You're just so mean to each other.

16:53.303 --> 16:56.556
And I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.434
Well, Phoebe, that's fine
because I'm not moving.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.729
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.522
I know I said some bad stuff...

17:05.691 --> 17:08.859
...but Rachel does have some qualities
that make her a good roommate.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.486
She gets tons of catalogs...

17:10.654 --> 17:14.198
...and, um, she'll fold down the pages
of the things she thinks I'd like.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.951
- What else?
- Uh...

17:17.118 --> 17:19.369
When I take a shower...

17:19.538 --> 17:21.664
...she leaves me little notes
on the mirror.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.083
Yeah, I do. I do do that.

17:24.251 --> 17:28.296
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.009
When I fall asleep on the couch
after reading...

17:34.136 --> 17:36.220
...she covers me over with a blanket.

17:36.388 --> 17:40.349
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

17:43.562 --> 17:47.106
And when I told her I was
gonna move in with Chandler...

17:47.441 --> 17:49.484
...she was really supportive.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.946
You were so great.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.992
You made it so easy.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.038
And now you have to leave.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.707
And I have to live with a boy!

18:18.847 --> 18:20.556
Hey.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.685
- She really left.
- I know.

18:26.730 --> 18:30.441
- Thank you.
- No problem, roomie.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.409
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.287
What the hell is that dog doing here?

18:44.414 --> 18:46.833
- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
- Mm.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.044
This isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

18:50.212 --> 18:53.923
...but for me this has been really great,
you know?

18:54.091 --> 18:57.552
I think because it didn't involve divorce...

18:57.719 --> 18:59.011
...or projectile vomiting.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.933
I was just thinking,
if you'd gone to Vail...

19:04.101 --> 19:07.937
...or if you guys had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...

19:08.355 --> 19:09.772
...syphilis and stuff...

19:12.025 --> 19:13.985
...we wouldn't be all together, you know?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.903
So I guess what I'm trying to say...

19:16.071 --> 19:21.993
...is that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.662
That's so sweet.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.497
Thank you.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.707
Mm.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.751
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.170
And a crappy New Year.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.797
Hear, hear.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.972
You can't move. You just...
You just can't.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.808
Rachel's right.
This is where you guys belong.

19:45.976 --> 19:49.520
You don't wanna live in Westchester.
That's the worst of the Chesters.

19:50.814 --> 19:54.317
You know, sometimes when I'm alone
in my apartment, I look over here...

19:54.484 --> 19:57.820
...and you guys are just having dinner...

19:57.988 --> 20:00.907
...or watching TV or something...

20:01.575 --> 20:03.284
...but it makes me feel better.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.953
And now when I look over,
who am I gonna see?

20:06.121 --> 20:09.123
The Gottliebs? The Yangs?

20:09.499 --> 20:11.375
They don't make me feel so good.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.881
Yeah. So don't move, okay?
Just stay here...

20:17.049 --> 20:19.300
...and maybe close your blinds at night.
- Hey.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.475
Hello?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.355
It's Nancy. They responded to our offer.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.814
And?

20:34.858 --> 20:36.442
Yeah...

20:36.610 --> 20:38.903
Okay. Thanks.

20:40.864 --> 20:41.948
They passed.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.452
They said they won't go a penny
under the asking price.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.497
- We can't afford that.
- I know.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.125
Well, there you go.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.632
I'm really sorry, you guys.

20:59.800 --> 21:04.011
Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry
that phone call didn't come...

21:04.179 --> 21:07.056
...before I told you about looking
through the window.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.600
Yeah. Well, we're gonna
let you be alone.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.727
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, we'll be okay.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.938
Love you guys.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.609
You know, I'm really sorry
I wasn't more supportive before.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.361
That's okay. We understand.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.363
Yeah, and about this Nancy...

21:22.531 --> 21:24.615
If you're not sleeping with her,
should I?

21:31.665 --> 21:34.250
I know there'll be other houses,
but I just, uh...

21:34.418 --> 21:37.586
- I loved that one so much.
- Yeah.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.131
Well, it's a good thing we got it then.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.843
- What?
- We got the house.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.596
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't wanna tell you in front of them.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.348
We got it? We got the house?

21:49.516 --> 21:51.475
- We're getting a house.
- Oh!

21:53.895 --> 21:54.937
Mm.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.190
- We're getting a house.
- And a baby.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.775
We're growing up.

22:01.236 --> 22:02.653
We sure are.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.697
Who's gonna tell them?

22:04.865 --> 22:07.116
- Not it.
- Not it. Damn it!

22:11.872 --> 22:13.539
- And, Rachel, this is yours.
- Aah!

22:13.707 --> 22:15.416
Why? What are these for?

22:15.584 --> 22:18.336
- You'll see.
- All right, everybody open them.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.049
Oh, wow, this is so beautiful.

22:23.216 --> 22:26.052
Oh, these are the ones
I was looking at in the store.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.137
- I know.
- Oh, I love this.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.723
A meatball sub.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.266
Thanks.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.061
Seriously, guys, what's going on?
What are these for?

22:35.270 --> 22:38.397
Well, I didn't know
how to tell you before...

22:38.565 --> 22:40.524
...but we got the house.
- Enjoy.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.822
What did they say?
