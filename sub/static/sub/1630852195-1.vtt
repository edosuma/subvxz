you hate your job.

30:12.996 --> 30:13.896
-Hmm.
-Ah!

30:13.996 --> 30:15.896
Do you want me to
get you out of it?

30:15.996 --> 30:19.816
-What do you mean?
-I could show up in Australia.

30:19.916 --> 30:24.216
Scoop you up and whisk you off
to Bora Bora, hmm?

30:24.316 --> 30:26.696
We have fun together, don't we?

30:26.796 --> 30:29.736

as that sounds...

30:29.836 --> 30:32.236
-Hmm.
-..I have to work.

30:33.236 --> 30:34.896
-Oh.
-Mmm.

30:34.996 --> 30:36.976
Read the book. It's amazing.

30:37.076 --> 30:40.637
The author, Clementine,
she's really fascinating.

30:41.637 --> 30:46.037
Well, you know how much
I love to read books.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.617

-I'm so sorry, Ms London.
-Don't apologise.

31:00.397 --> 31:02.697
A gingerbread latte.
It's festive.

who likes festive lattes?

31:07.957 --> 31:09.457

about Christmas

didn't involve craft cocktails

of course I made it.

I'm giving you a bestseller.

38:54.132 --> 38:57.072
Dolly! Hey, Dolly girl!

38:57.172 --> 38:59.172
Come to Mama.

38:59.852 --> 39:02.212
-Wait. Isn't that a bull?
-Uh...

39:03.212 --> 39:04.992
Wait. Aren't they...both bulls?

39:05.092 --> 39:08.912
No! I think we have stared at
bovine genitalia long enough!

39:09.012 --> 39:11.432
Let's go see the horses. Yes?
Horses!

39:11.532 --> 39:13.592
Oh, go...go ahead. (LAUGHS)

39:13.692 --> 39:15.712
I found half a bar. (CHUCKLES)

39:15.812 --> 39:17.713
EMMY: Oh, don't you
just love that...

39:17.813 --> 39:19.993
Oof! ..horsey smell?

39:20.093 --> 39:21.073
JACK: Hi.

39:21.173 --> 39:22.873
Hey, what's going on?

39:22.973 --> 39:24.753
-Hey, you.
EMMY: Oh, wow. That's amazing.

39:24.853 --> 39:26.673
He doesn't usually let anyone
but my mum...me

39:26.773 --> 39:28.313
get that close...to him.

39:28.413 --> 39:30.073
(CHUCKLES)
What's this big guy's name?

39:30.173 --> 39:33.233
Elton. And this is Kiki.

39:33.333 --> 39:35.073
-Elton and Kiki?
-Yeah!

39:35.173 --> 39:38.033
You know, like Elton John
and Kiki Dee, famous, uh, duet.

39:38.133 --> 39:40.433
No. I don't think so.

39:40.533 --> 39:42.073
-No?
-No. How does it go?

39:42.173 --> 39:43.753
-The duet?
-Yes. Sing a bit.

39:43.853 --> 39:45.913
Oh, you want...
You want me to sing a duet?

39:46.013 --> 39:47.593
Yeah. A bit.

39:47.693 --> 39:49.234
I'm really... (LAUGHS)
..not much of a singer.

39:49.334 --> 39:52.594
-No?
-Um... Uh... Um... OK.

39:52.694 --> 39:54.954
(SINGS) ♪ Don't go
breaking my heart

39:55.054 --> 39:56.554
♪ I couldn't if I tried... ♪

39:56.654 --> 39:58.794
-JACK: Uh-huh. "Don't..."
-I'm sorry.

39:58.894 --> 40:00.514
-Yeah.
-I'm not much of a singer.

40:00.614 --> 40:02.394
And I don't really have
a lot of tune.

40:02.494 --> 40:04.874
"..go breaking my heart."

40:04.974 --> 40:06.554
Ha ha!

40:06.654 --> 40:08.434
-"Take the weight off of me."
-Oh, yeah.

40:08.534 --> 40:10.194
I see what you're doing.
You got me.

40:10.294 --> 40:12.854
"Honey, when I knock
on your door..."?

40:15.014 --> 40:16.714
"I gave you my key."

40:16.814 --> 40:18.814
(BOTH LAUGH)

40:21.255 --> 40:23.475
I'm sorry. You...you
just look so familiar.

40:23.575 --> 40:25.875
I...I feel like we've met.

40:25.975 --> 40:28.755
Oh, no! Uh-uh.

40:28.855 --> 40:30.435
'Cause I live here
on a farm and...

40:30.535 --> 40:33.835
..you live in, um, New Nyo...
New York, New York.

40:33.935 --> 40:35.935
Yeah.

40:36.895 --> 40:38.395
Come on!

40:38.495 --> 40:40.115
Come back, please!

40:40.215 --> 40:41.955
Oh!

40:42.055 --> 40:44.055
Oh, good.

40:45.615 --> 40:47.195
A little help!

40:47.295 --> 40:50.415
A deranged child
is trying to kill me.

40:51.935 --> 40:53.076
Hello.

40:53.176 --> 40:54.796
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

40:54.896 --> 40:57.156
Who are you people? What are you
doing on private property?

40:57.256 --> 40:58.516
Do you know this girl?

40:58.616 --> 41:00.436
Uh, yes, of course I know her.

41:00.536 --> 41:02.916
-I don't know you!
-JACK: Ha ha!

41:03.016 --> 41:04.596
-Oh, this is the daughter.
-What?

41:04.696 --> 41:06.436
The one in your book
with the anger issues.

41:06.536 --> 41:08.196
You thought my daughter
had anger issues?

41:08.296 --> 41:10.196
She's written that way, no?

41:10.296 --> 41:11.876
Ah, yes, of course
it's my daughter!

41:11.976 --> 41:14.276
You will not take that tone
with your mummy, young lady!

41:14.376 --> 41:15.996
Now, put that pitchfork down.

41:16.096 --> 41:18.636
These are the guests I told you
were coming for Christmas.

41:18.736 --> 41:20.156
You're not my mother!

41:20.256 --> 41:23.196
Oh! Little Emmy took
a horse kick to the face

41:23.296 --> 41:24.436
a few years back.

41:24.536 --> 41:25.957
She hasn't been the same since.

41:26.057 --> 41:27.077
I'm Violet.

41:27.177 --> 41:28.597
See? Memory is totally shot.

41:28.697 --> 41:29.957
-Oh.
-Quite heartbreaking, actually.

41:30.057 --> 41:32.237
Alright, darling, if you want us
to call you Violet,

41:32.337 --> 41:33.517
we'll call you Violet.

41:33.617 --> 41:37.597
-One more step...
-You're acting crazy, darling.

41:37.697 --> 41:40.597
I'm not the crazy one, lady!
I come here to feed the horses.

41:40.697 --> 41:41.997
(WHISPERS) Listen to me.

41:42.097 --> 41:44.437
Just go along with it and
I'll give you anything you want.

41:44.537 --> 41:45.717
(EMMY LAUGHS FALSELY)

41:45.817 --> 41:46.997
-Like money?
-Yes.

41:47.097 --> 41:49.137
Just go with it, OK? Please.

41:50.737 --> 41:52.357
Oh, Mummy,
I didn't recognise you

41:52.457 --> 41:55.117
on account of that horse kick
to my face a few years back.

41:55.217 --> 41:56.957
-Ohh!
-I want the money in cash.

41:57.057 --> 41:59.058
And I want it in writing.

41:59.618 --> 42:03.318
Well, step-dada Miles
will be so glad

42:03.418 --> 42:05.358
you came back
from your sleepover

42:05.458 --> 42:08.138
and, uh, are spending Christmas
with us after all!

42:09.138 --> 42:11.078
VIOLET: Hey! Stop it.
Hands off.

42:11.178 --> 42:12.918
-EMMY: Go on!
-Quit it!

42:13.018 --> 42:16.358
-Whose devil child is this?
-DAVID: Hi, Violet.

42:16.458 --> 42:19.158
This is Rita Hay's daughter
from two properties down.

42:19.258 --> 42:21.758
-And we pay her to farmhand.
-EMMY: Oh!

42:21.858 --> 42:23.198
Well, your little farmhand

42:23.298 --> 42:24.998
almost blew
our entire operation.

42:25.098 --> 42:26.198
-Operation?
-Yeah.

42:26.298 --> 42:28.958
There some kind of spy thing
going down?

42:29.058 --> 42:31.239
Because I can keep a secret.

42:31.339 --> 42:32.559
EMMY: I need a drink.

42:32.659 --> 42:34.199
Hey, what's with
crazy lady's accent?

42:34.299 --> 42:36.439
-Remember lovely Clementine?
-Yeah.

42:36.539 --> 42:37.559
That's her offspring.

42:37.659 --> 42:40.159
Oh, sad sack New Yorker.

42:40.259 --> 42:41.799
Who called me that?
Who called me that?

42:41.899 --> 42:44.199
Well, whoever it is,
she owes me cash.

42:44.299 --> 42:45.439
EMMY: Yeah!

42:45.539 --> 42:48.519
Because country bumpkin
Wednesday Addams here

42:48.619 --> 42:52.279
now has London & London thinking
she's me...her...my daughter,

42:52.379 --> 42:55.439
who should be called Emmy
and is now named Violet.

42:55.539 --> 42:57.539
You're the one who said it.

42:58.299 --> 42:59.439
Wait a second.

42:59.539 --> 43:01.519
Could we borrow her
for a couple of days?

43:01.619 --> 43:03.640
-VIOLET: Borrow me?
-MILES: Um...

43:03.740 --> 43:05.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:05.380 --> 43:08.240
Would your parents mind if you
weren't with them for Christmas,

43:08.340 --> 43:10.400
if you were with us,
would they miss you?

43:10.500 --> 43:12.560
Lady, I'm number four
of nine kids.

43:12.660 --> 43:14.400
No-one would even notice
I'm gone.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.840
-Yes!
-I'll give her parents a call.

43:16.940 --> 43:18.440
EMMY: Great. It's settled then.
Listen.

43:18.540 --> 43:23.200
Sweetie, all you're gonna have
to do is play make-believe.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.480
Pretend that
I'm your Australian mummy

43:26.580 --> 43:29.480
and Miles here
is your step-dada!

43:29.580 --> 43:31.880
-Do you think you can do that?
-Yeah, I can do that.

43:31.980 --> 43:32.920
-Great!
-For $1,000.

43:33.020 --> 43:34.040
You're kidding?

43:34.140 --> 43:35.841
You said you could give me
anything I want.

43:35.941 --> 43:38.561
I can get a lot of things
I want for $1,000.

43:38.661 --> 43:40.561
EMMY: You are a child, right?

43:40.661 --> 43:42.601
Not a lawyer
with a growth deficiency?

43:42.701 --> 43:44.081
I can just go home, you know.

43:44.181 --> 43:46.181
That's fine. You're a little...

43:47.061 --> 43:47.961
500.

43:48.061 --> 43:49.761
-850.
-550.

43:49.861 --> 43:50.841
700.

43:50.941 --> 43:53.241
Deal. How old are you, anyway?

43:53.341 --> 43:55.921
-I'm 10 and three quarters.
-Actually, you just turned 12.

43:56.021 --> 43:58.281
Happy birthday. You're getting a
wildly inappropriate cash gift.

43:58.381 --> 44:00.981
Put the hat back on!
You look like Oliver Twist.

44:05.701 --> 44:06.962
One...

44:07.062 --> 44:08.922
..two...three!

44:09.022 --> 44:10.202
(ALL CHEER)

44:10.302 --> 44:12.122
There we go.

44:12.222 --> 44:13.922
Merry Christmas.

44:14.022 --> 44:15.442
-VIOLET: David.
-EMMY: Merry Christmas.

44:15.542 --> 44:16.922
-MILES: Darling.
-Hi.

44:17.022 --> 44:19.322
-(MILES CHUCKLES)
-Dig in, everybody.

44:19.422 --> 44:21.362
(CHATTER)

44:21.462 --> 44:24.042
-MILES: Want some more salmon?
-DAVID: Thank you, darling. Uh!

44:24.142 --> 44:26.722
(CHATTER CONTINUES)

44:26.822 --> 44:29.202
EMMY: Yeah. Lots of chilli,
chilli, chillies in there.

44:29.302 --> 44:32.602
(CHATTER CONTINUES)

44:32.702 --> 44:34.362
EMMY: Brussels sprouts.

44:34.462 --> 44:36.282
DAVID: Who would like
some more tomatoes?

44:36.382 --> 44:38.122
I've grown them all myself.

44:38.222 --> 44:39.763
-MILES: They're lovely.
-DAVID: I absolutely...

44:39.863 --> 44:43.363
It's en... No, no, no.
That...that's quite enough.

44:43.463 --> 44:46.903
(CHATTER CONTINUES)

44:56.543 --> 45:00.723
So, tell me, American friends...

45:00.823 --> 45:02.563
-(CHUCKLES)
-..do you, um...

45:02.663 --> 45:05.483
..visit the homes
of prospective authors

45:05.583 --> 45:07.643
on the other side
of the planet often

45:07.743 --> 45:11.444
or is this a...
a special occasion?

45:11.544 --> 45:13.884
Just standard business practice.

45:13.984 --> 45:15.244
Oh.

45:15.344 --> 45:17.044
JACK: We love to...to see
all our authors

45:17.144 --> 45:18.604
before we...we publish them.

45:18.704 --> 45:21.884
Oh, I had to see the
Clementine magic for myself.

45:21.984 --> 45:24.564
JACK: Yeah.
Uh, launching a brand is, uh...

45:24.664 --> 45:26.484
..it's a big commitment.

45:26.584 --> 45:30.244
Oh, uh, I'm a...brand now.

45:30.344 --> 45:33.764
Um, yeah, I mean, if everything
goes the way we hope it does,

45:33.864 --> 45:37.164
talking about launches
in every major market,

45:37.264 --> 45:39.604
social media blitz,
the whole kit and caboodle.

45:39.704 --> 45:42.804
Wow! All from...one book.

45:42.904 --> 45:44.645
Maybe even a TV show!
(CHUCKLES)

45:44.745 --> 45:48.485
Oh, my son doesn't champion
titles often,

45:48.585 --> 45:52.245
so his sudden interest
in all things...you... (LAUGHS)

45:52.345 --> 45:55.245
..that's what has me
truly intrigued.

45:55.345 --> 45:58.845
Yeah. Listen, it's a very
special book, Clementine.

45:58.945 --> 46:02.565
Oh, my God,
this is so boring.

46:02.665 --> 46:05.605
-(LAUGHS) Darling! Darling...
-(JACK LAUGHS)

46:05.705 --> 46:07.445
VIOLET: Why don't we talk about
something interesting?

46:07.545 --> 46:11.145
Like global warming
or carbon footprints.

46:12.625 --> 46:14.045
I bet you own a few boats.

46:14.145 --> 46:15.566
(LAUGHS)

46:15.666 --> 46:17.166
-Um... (LAUGHS)
-One.

46:17.266 --> 46:19.726
-And it's a yacht.
-Touché.

46:19.826 --> 46:22.606
Hey, darling,
don't you have homework to do?

46:22.706 --> 46:24.766
It's Christmas Eve Eve.
There is no school.

46:24.866 --> 46:27.246
-Ah, right, no school.
-VIOLET: Oh!

46:27.346 --> 46:29.566
Look! Mistletoe!

46:29.666 --> 46:31.086
EMMY: That's not mistletoe,
darling.

46:31.186 --> 46:33.086
-That's a weed.
-(JACK LAUGHS)

46:33.186 --> 46:35.806
You and step-dada should kiss.

46:35.906 --> 46:38.046
Oh...

46:38.146 --> 46:40.686
-ELLISON: Oh.
-No, we don't have to kiss.

46:40.786 --> 46:44.886
Don't let me stop you. (LAUGHS)
'Tis the season.

46:44.986 --> 46:47.767
MILES: Oh, yeah! Ha ha!

46:47.867 --> 46:50.967
-Get it up ya!
-OK. (LAUGHS)

46:51.067 --> 46:52.247
Go, Rover.

46:52.347 --> 46:56.667
MILES: Hmm! (MOANS PASSIONATELY)

46:57.667 --> 46:58.727
(CHUCKLES)

46:58.827 --> 47:00.887
EMMY: Ohhh!

47:00.987 --> 47:02.767
-(VIOLET CHUCKLES)
-(MILES SIGHS)

47:02.867 --> 47:04.767
-Wasn't that lovely?
-(EMMY CHUCKLES)

47:04.867 --> 47:06.887
You guys are such
the perfect match.

47:06.987 --> 47:10.327
Oh, thank you, darling. Makes us
so happy to hear you say that.

47:10.427 --> 47:12.667
(DAVID CLEARS THROAT)

47:13.667 --> 47:17.107
I'm just going to go and
check on the cheese platters.

47:21.348 --> 47:23.348
-Ohh.
-DAVID: Miles.

47:24.028 --> 47:26.368
-Got it. (CHUCKLES)
-Yeah.

47:26.468 --> 47:28.768
Yes. Go help him, sweetheart.
(SIGHS)

47:28.868 --> 47:31.308
Aren't we feeling
that Christmas spirit now?

47:32.948 --> 47:34.248
(DAVID EXHALES DEEPLY)

47:34.348 --> 47:36.768
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

47:36.868 --> 47:38.848
-Are you OK?
-Yeah. Yeah!

47:38.948 --> 47:41.888
I just realised, this epiphany,

47:41.988 --> 47:45.128
that we're living
in our favourite movie.

47:45.228 --> 47:46.888
-'Beaches'?
-No!

47:46.988 --> 47:48.448
'The Birdcage'!

47:48.548 --> 47:49.928
-Oh!
-It's the same!

47:50.028 --> 47:51.888
It's like I'm Robin Williams.

47:51.988 --> 47:53.409
I'm Nathan Lane!

47:53.509 --> 47:54.889
We need an Agador.

47:54.989 --> 47:56.329
Oh! Ohh.

in your book

where you were talking about
swimming with the yabbies.

like a cousin to the crab,

are also cousins,

50:10.913 --> 50:12.933

about it, I guess.

some time with my son.
