WEBVTT

00:13.972 --> 00:14.806
Sorry.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.350
I was running an errand for my tutor.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.518
I should be your tutor.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.937
Selena and Nicole and Angus
got to keep theirs.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.939
I don't know why I got singled out.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.940
Keep theirs, what?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.569
You know what we should do at break?

00:27.652 --> 00:29.779
Go to my parents' in Saint Lucia.
It's gorgeous.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.698
Oh, yeah, I can't do that.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.033
You can and you will.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.327
I want to show off that hot bod of yours.
My brother's gonna get an eating disorder.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.121
Um...

00:38.663 --> 00:39.622
Oh, damn, I'm late.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.874
You don't have a class.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.001
No, I'm doing... I'm meeting Chad
for a one-on-one.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.794
He's helping me finesse my basket toss.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.463
Ah, I knew you'd like cheer.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.340
Are you kidding me?
I live for cheer squad.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.801
I'm just praying someone sprains an ankle,

00:52.135 --> 00:53.845
so first alternate gets his big break.

00:53.928 --> 00:54.971
We can only hope.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.311
I miss you already.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.231
Your cupie could use some work, too.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.695
I thought I could do this, Hamish, but...

01:11.654 --> 01:14.449
this whole Order thing
is making me queasy.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.910
Look, I know things are a mess right now,

01:16.993 --> 01:19.329
but the only way out is through.

01:19.829 --> 01:20.705
You're right.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.583
No guts, no glory.

01:23.958 --> 01:24.876
Heads up.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.086
Oh, look.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.171
It's the Hardy Boys.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.007
For acolytes who just met,
you guys are pretty tight.

01:31.424 --> 01:35.136
Well, it does feel like
we've known each other for a while.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.264
You can't fight your feelings.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.850
Yes, you can, but what's the point?

01:42.018 --> 01:42.852
Kiss me.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.110
-Let's get out of here.
-Mm.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.112
Excuse me. Oh!

01:54.405 --> 01:55.281
Called it.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.372
<i>Flos conspice.</i>

02:05.041 --> 02:06.084
Cute...

02:07.961 --> 02:09.671
if you're into that kind of thing.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.841
The incantation you're using
is <i>mihi transferat.</i>

02:15.301 --> 02:17.011
<i>Mihi transferat.</i>

02:28.231 --> 02:30.984
So, gee, I wonder
who's a total natural around here.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.194
It's a pretty easy spell.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.612
No spell is easy.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.657
You're light-years ahead
of where I was in my training.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.077
You should be really proud of yourself,
because I am--

02:41.161 --> 02:41.995
I--

02:50.086 --> 02:51.713
You can't stand compliments.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.590
Shut up.

02:56.634 --> 02:57.468
I...

02:57.552 --> 02:58.970
It makes you even more adorable.

03:00.805 --> 03:01.639
I have to go.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.642
I found your on/off button.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.270
I like your shoes!

03:09.147 --> 03:11.733
"I like your shoes"?

03:11.816 --> 03:13.193
She's not wrong.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.944
It could use a little work.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.279
Hey, my cupie is tight.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.448
If I wanted to act this much,

03:18.531 --> 03:20.074
I would have majored in theater.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.286
I've scheduled fake texts
every 15 minutes,

03:23.369 --> 03:25.538
so I always have an excuse
to get away from Gabrielle.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.456
Smart.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.417
Randall and I had to kiss each other
to get away from our monitors.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.376
Yeah.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.670
"Had to." We "had to."

03:33.296 --> 03:37.008
What I hate is how everything's a lie,
even if it doesn't feel that way.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.094
Well,

03:40.428 --> 03:42.722
at least you're lying to each other.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.641
Doesn't make it any easier.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.976
Sometimes I wish
I'd never gotten my memory back.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.895
Sure would be a lot more peaceful.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.688
Guys, you don't mean that.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.565
We'd be total strangers.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.275
I feel like a stranger to myself.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.445
I have to live in a fake apartment
with fake friends.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.656
At least you have your own stuff,
and your own place.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.992
I mean, Gabrielle treats me
like her own private Ken doll.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.827
She must have really hated her Ken dolls.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.955
-Crash here.
- No.

04:07.038 --> 04:07.872
We agreed.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.958
This place is only for debriefs,

04:10.416 --> 04:11.542
and the occasional cocktail.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.669
That's it.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.296
We have to destroy them.
Let's go, right now.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.547
That's a great fantasy,

04:16.631 --> 04:18.258
but we're a month into classes

04:18.341 --> 04:20.760
and we have yet to come up
with a decent plan.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.137
Even if we did,
they still have all our stuff.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.973
Our hide lockers, Midnight.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.558
No, they don't <i>have</i> all of our stuff.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.144
They stole it.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.355
So let's steal it back.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.400
No, no, look, all of our stuff
is in their vault.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.986
So if we take it back
and we steal all of their stuff,

04:38.486 --> 04:40.947
doesn't matter if anyone knows
we have our memories back or not,

04:41.364 --> 04:44.158
'cause we would have
ripped the heart out of the Order

04:44.242 --> 04:47.287
and left them spurting arterial blood
all over the wall.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.455
Are you suggesting

04:50.123 --> 04:51.624
a magic heist?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.876
Yes. Magic heist.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.753
Magic heist!

04:55.837 --> 04:56.879
Magic heist!

04:56.963 --> 04:59.549
Magic heist! Magic heist!

04:59.632 --> 05:01.718
Magic heist! Magic heist!

05:01.801 --> 05:03.636
Magic heist! Magic heist!

05:09.225 --> 05:13.187
<i>Sanguis meus tuas laminas acuit.</i>

05:16.524 --> 05:20.361
<i>Sanguis meus tuas laminas acuit.</i>

05:26.034 --> 05:29.454
<i>There's only one entrance</i>
<i>to the vault, and it's in the reliquary.</i>

05:30.621 --> 05:32.957
<i>It's a secret door</i>
<i>behind one of the bookcases,</i>

05:33.041 --> 05:34.667
<i>so access is no problem.</i>

05:39.380 --> 05:41.299
<i>And the corridor itself is a cakewalk.</i>

05:41.632 --> 05:44.177
<i>No booby traps, no secret handshakes.</i>

05:44.927 --> 05:46.846
<i>The door doesn't even have a lock.</i>

05:57.940 --> 06:02.195
<i>Sanguis meus tuas laminas acuit.</i>

06:05.615 --> 06:07.450
It's shocking how easy
this is going to be.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.745
Only challenging part will be
moving everything out and stashing it.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.455
May be able to help with that.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.667
This is unbelievable.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.587
You own this but you were
still living at the den?

06:19.670 --> 06:22.590
Well, I find wolfing out
in downtown Norwich

06:22.673 --> 06:24.258
basically impossible.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.887
-Will this hold the contents of the vault?
-Yeah, this'll hold everything

06:27.970 --> 06:30.223
We're doing a magic heist!

06:30.306 --> 06:32.308
I can't believe you own this apartment.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.143
I own the building.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.563
You do realize we have one small problem.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.481
And that is?

06:38.564 --> 06:40.566
None of us can access the reliquary.

06:40.942 --> 06:41.776
Shit.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.320
Lilith's right.
We're gonna need a Magistratus.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.657
Or, at least their access sigil.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.080
- Alyssa.
- Damn it.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.543
What are you doing here?

06:59.043 --> 06:59.919
Returning this.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.297
What are you doing?

07:05.049 --> 07:08.177
Ooh, you look like Pete after he tried
cooking pancakes that one time.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.388
I'm trying to fix my magic.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.100
Just give it a few days.
It'll work itself out.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.518
It will.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.147
It's one thing for my magic
not to work.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.357
-It's a whole other to--
-Hurt someone.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.734
I get it.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.070
I...

07:27.363 --> 07:28.489
killed that girl.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.700
I know the feeling.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.203
Let me help you here.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.087
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

07:43.171 --> 07:44.005
Tell them what?

07:44.714 --> 07:45.673
About my magic.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.342
I meant that like, "Tell them what?"

07:48.426 --> 07:49.886
because there's nothing to tell.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.596
Except for my secret.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.097
My homicidal secret.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.057
Yeah, I mean, the last thing you'd want

07:55.141 --> 07:57.435
is anyone here to find out
you don't wanna kill someone.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.563
It's not funny.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.606
It's kind of funny.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.025
Alyssa.

08:05.026 --> 08:05.860
Hey.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.070
It's gonna be okay.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.074
No, it's not.

08:14.994 --> 08:15.828
This...

08:16.537 --> 08:17.705
is my everything...

08:18.623 --> 08:21.000
and now I'm losing it.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.589
<i>Mihi transferat.</i>

08:27.590 --> 08:28.466
What?

08:34.639 --> 08:35.723
You'll get it back.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.099
Wait, what?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.268
Your magic, you're going to get it back.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.103
No, before that, you said something else.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.732
Alyssa, I'm just trying
to be supportive here.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.484
Are you?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.528
Well, I thought I was.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.613
I guess you know better.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.058
-Are you sure this is gonna work?
-What happens if it doesn't work?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.309
This better work.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.769
It's gonna work, guys.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.217
Hm, Milton.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.844
Mm, Goethe.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.516
-Dante.
-Ahh.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.851
Smell you.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.686
Big sign over Pop's bathroom,

10:04.520 --> 10:05.938
and truer words were never spoken.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.648
This is too easy.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.442
It's like Vera wants to be robbed.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.485
Candy from a baby.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.403
Don't jinx it.

10:18.117 --> 10:18.993
Guys?

10:19.076 --> 10:20.202
What's happening?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.371
-Hamish. Lilith. Randall!
- Guys?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.581
Guys?

10:23.664 --> 10:24.790
Where'd everyone go?

10:25.625 --> 10:26.834
Where have I gone?

10:29.253 --> 10:30.087
Guys?

10:33.215 --> 10:34.216
Keep your eyes open.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.304
Looks like there's a good-sized spider
around here someplace.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.602
What do you get when you cross
a spider and a squirrel?

10:45.394 --> 10:49.857
You get a bug that will climb your leg
and eat your nuts.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.654
Why did the spider cross the road?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.823
There was no spider.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.576
He's a metaphorical manifestation

11:00.660 --> 11:03.287
of your pathological
and subconscious fear!

11:05.039 --> 11:05.915
Jack?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.626
Hamish? Lilith?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.734
<i>You're one of us, Randall.</i>

11:41.867 --> 11:42.743
Guys.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.498
Hamish, Lilith, Randall, where are you?

11:50.584 --> 11:51.419
Alyssa?

11:56.465 --> 11:57.383
Hey.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.510
-Hey!

12:00.094 --> 12:00.970
No!

12:09.478 --> 12:10.354
No, no, no.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.523
No.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.360
No!

12:19.405 --> 12:21.240
-A ventriloquist doll?
-Oh.

12:21.323 --> 12:25.202
Stupid Ricky Simarco
and his stupid fifth birthday party.

12:27.037 --> 12:27.913
What'd you see?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.123
Nothing.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.666
Nothing?

12:31.792 --> 12:32.626
Nothing.

12:35.129 --> 12:35.963
Oh.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.675
At least now I know why
Alyssa calls it the fear corridor.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.681
You didn't think to tell us that
before leading us down

12:45.765 --> 12:49.018
the creepy-ass hallway
that turns our worst fears into a reality?

12:49.101 --> 12:51.187
It wasn't like that when I went with her.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.272
So what was it like?

12:53.355 --> 12:55.024
It was a hell of a lot less scary.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.317
Jack, buddy,

12:56.692 --> 12:59.278
specificity is kind of important
right now.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.198
We went through the entrance,

13:02.281 --> 13:04.116
and she told me
it was called the fear corridor,

13:04.200 --> 13:06.744
and then she took my hand
as we passed under the inscription.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.872
The inscription must be
some kind of enchantment.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.666
Alyssa must have some kind of neutralizer.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.668
Did she utter an incantation?

13:14.752 --> 13:16.587
Was she carrying anything?

13:16.670 --> 13:18.839
She was wearing a necklace
I'd never seen before.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.132
Big amulet.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.052
About so big with a raised symbol on it?

13:23.469 --> 13:25.054
Yeah, an inscription around the edge.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.972
I've seen Vera wearing the same one.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.182
Mm, Vera.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.850
Sounds like we need that amulet.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.728
I burned all my good will with Alyssa.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.564
We'll just have to go to the source.

13:38.317 --> 13:42.947
<i>Redi ad ista inferna in quorum genitus es.</i>

13:43.948 --> 13:45.950
-And then you stab--
-With the sickle. Yes, I know.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.370
This isn't a dance recital.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.373
I'm here to help.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.250
May I?

14:11.183 --> 14:12.518
This takes me back, huh?

14:13.352 --> 14:15.521
Remember that first convention in DC?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.773
The night out with the Brazilian chapter?

14:17.857 --> 14:18.858
How could I forget?

14:18.941 --> 14:23.279
You keep using that one same photo
for all your social media profiles.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.782
Well, every time I try to change it,
someone messages me to switch it back.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.783
Mm.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.369
Excuse me, Grand Magus.

14:30.452 --> 14:33.289
I figured it was 5:00 somewhere
and you might want a cocktail.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.748
-We're busy.
-Yes, please.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.876
The Julian Assange for you.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.088
-And a Grand Magus for the Grand Magus.
-Mm.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.048
Mm.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.175
Similar to a Winter's Eve, with a twist.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.469
Thank you, acolyte.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.512
You're welcome.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.474
What is this, vodka and nut milk?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.602
It's horchata and brennivín.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.186
The subtlety isn't for everyone.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.773
How is yours, Magus?

14:59.857 --> 15:02.109
Very spirit-forward,

15:02.943 --> 15:04.236
but intriguing.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.572
I hate nut milk.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.282
I'm glad you like it.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.661
Why is it called the Julian Assange?

15:15.122 --> 15:15.956
Well,

15:16.206 --> 15:19.710
he did overstay his welcome
at the Ecuadorean embassy.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.300
You get it?

15:26.550 --> 15:27.593
Think so.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.813
<i>Prodatur quod visum est.</i>

15:54.036 --> 15:56.205
So evocative.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.458
I'm reminded
of Sebnem Ugural's portraiture.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.962
Sweet use of that fine arts education.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.548
Well, I'll tell you, the necromancer
version of this was hella messier.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.550
What's this called?

16:08.634 --> 16:09.843
Optography.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.345
Selena showed it to me.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.180
She's actually a fine tutor.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.351
Well, you know, except for the part
where I hate the Order,

16:17.810 --> 16:19.895
I'm actually enjoying the training
this time around.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.815
It's definitely easier when
you already know what you're doing.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.692
I feel like I'm absorbing more.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.944
Yeah, great, the Order's amazing.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.278
Let's buy them a present.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.279
Relax, buddy.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.614
No one's lost the plot.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.157
Yeah, we're still gonna burn it down.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.159
But it is cool to learn new things.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.703
Okay.

16:36.912 --> 16:40.290
I will get this 3D-printed...

16:41.291 --> 16:44.545
...and then we are saying goodbye
to optography and the Order.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.338
Actually, I just learned an incantation

16:46.422 --> 16:48.424
that could replicate it
without the 3D print...

16:48.507 --> 16:49.842
Okay.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.149
So,

17:06.066 --> 17:07.693
who wants to do the honors?

17:10.821 --> 17:11.655
Okay.

17:11.947 --> 17:12.823
Here we go.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.874
Didn't you say something about...

17:22.708 --> 17:23.542
holding hands?

17:25.419 --> 17:27.588
As we pass under the inscription,
we have to.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.089
Mm-hm.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.011
It's not 'cause I'm scared.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.179
Yeah.

17:35.637 --> 17:36.722
It's protocol.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.891
Exactly. Protocol.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.684
Nothing else.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.437
It's gonna work, you guys.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.105
Magic heist.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.233
-Magic heist.
-Magic heist.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.092
Anyone got a plan C?

18:20.390 --> 18:21.600
Oh, all right.

18:21.683 --> 18:25.104
Uh, wave hello to Salvador,
and then settle yourselves.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.732
She's my new TA,
which makes her your new TA,

18:28.816 --> 18:32.236
and she'll be making my life easier when
she takes over the class on Thursdays.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.072
Also, I understand the AV system.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.490
Quit bragging.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.616
They're so banging.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.007
Is that Latin?

19:03.809 --> 19:04.643
Shopped!

19:07.354 --> 19:08.397
It's photoshopped.

19:10.607 --> 19:11.441
Buzzkill.

19:11.525 --> 19:16.488
Well, you all looked like believers
until Mighty Mouth here yelled, "Fake!"

19:16.989 --> 19:18.073
So what changed your minds?

19:18.157 --> 19:20.576
Oh, come on, it's obviously fake.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.620
Someone just happens to come across it
at exactly the right moment?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.080
So it's fake because of timing?

19:25.956 --> 19:27.833
-Where did you even find this?
- Oh.

19:27.916 --> 19:31.753
Now its providence makes a difference
as to whether it can be real or not.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.505
-Maybe.
- Okay.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.675
Fine, let's say it's fake.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.013
Let's say whoever filmed this
went to all that trouble. Why?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.473
For clicks, obviously.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.393
To convince you that everything you see
is unverifiable.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.688
Why do that?

19:50.856 --> 19:52.065
To control the narrative.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.029
If you can convince everyone
that the truth is fake...

19:58.822 --> 19:59.656
well...

20:00.324 --> 20:02.784
then you can keep the truth
and the power to yourself.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.332
Are you disagreeing with me?

20:14.755 --> 20:15.881
We need to tell Vera.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.383
Tell her what,
that a professor showed us a video?

20:18.467 --> 20:19.968
A video of some rando practicing magic.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.428
-And why did you--

20:22.137 --> 20:24.014
Don't forget to pick me up at 6:00.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.642
-We're going to dinner tonight, remember?
-Yeah, I wouldn't forget.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.394
Surprised to see you trying
independent thinking on for size.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.437
So was I.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.147
I didn't think your zip code went for it.

20:32.814 --> 20:35.150
Don't worry. I fully expect
to be back in line by graduation.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.235
Well, I hope not.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.445
Everyone these days wants
college to be a safe place,

20:38.528 --> 20:40.864
but I think it should be
the most dangerous place on Earth.

20:41.782 --> 20:42.991
Intellectually speaking.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.744
If you don't spend undergrad
challenging the system...

20:46.787 --> 20:48.205
what a waste of four years.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.500
Yeah, well, I'll take that
under advisement.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.168
You should.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.297
Babe, we need to get going.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.092
No question
who's controlling his narrative.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.426
-Got that right.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.762
What was all that about?

21:04.263 --> 21:07.182
Once again, the one percent is to blame
for everything wrong in this world.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.476
When did it become okay to blame us?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.311
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

21:11.395 --> 21:14.481
I'm not sure Shakespeare thought that
the rich was a disenfranchised minority,

21:14.564 --> 21:15.399
-but...
-Believe me,

21:15.482 --> 21:17.484
there are days I'd be glad
to not be so special.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.696
I'd trade places with that TA
and her ridiculous wardrobe, even,

21:20.779 --> 21:23.365
to get out of this demon containment
Vera's got me doing.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.909
What? Demon containment?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.787
Some big demon who pops up
every now and again,

21:28.870 --> 21:31.999
and apparently he's some sort of issue,
and it's so not fun.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.625
I thought demons would be fun.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.168
No, no, yeah.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.045
Yeah, demons should be fun.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.093
Demons.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.013
We summon a demon to do our heist.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.640
There are hundreds to choose from.
They all do different things.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.976
Found the perfect one.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.396
Its name is Zecchia.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.605
It's a baron demon,

21:55.689 --> 21:57.858
and it steals whatever
the summoner desires.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.943
Isn't there demon blowback?

22:00.027 --> 22:01.653
Won't we have to do something for it?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.572
No, that's the beauty of it. Okay?

22:03.655 --> 22:06.950
We call them, they show up,
we pay the toll, and they do our bidding.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.411
It's all about
following the protocol perfectly.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.705
I read half a dozen books,
and it's the one basic rule.

22:13.123 --> 22:13.957
I'm in.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.167
-Me, too.
- Nope.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.461
No, thanks. No way.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.504
Not a demon. Not ever.

22:20.547 --> 22:21.506
Quintuple negative.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.467
You wanted a new plan, here it is.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.469
You're talking full-on Order magic here.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.054
That doesn't make you nervous?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.805
Says the guy who wanted to be a war-wolf.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.015
Uh, were-lock.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.851
Randall, this does not make us converts.
It's just a means to an end.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.187
If we do this, the end is us

22:35.270 --> 22:37.189
totally absorbed into the Order.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.609
What we saw in the fear corridor
were nightmares, not prophecies.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.943
Are you sure?

22:43.362 --> 22:44.780
Demons are in Hell.

22:44.988 --> 22:49.409
I'm pretty sure Hell is a Judeo-Christian
concept applied to scare people.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.828
Demons are from wherever they're from
for a reason.

22:52.412 --> 22:55.040
We shouldn't try to draw them
into our... wherever.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.209
Well, look, yesterday you were all
"whatever it takes,"

22:57.292 --> 22:59.878
and today, you're all "no demon,"
so make up your mind.

22:59.961 --> 23:03.382
You weren't the one with a Sabnock sigil
stuck in your neck.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.674
It's a hard "no" for me.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.260
Should be for you, too.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.183
We're still doing this.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.060
Of course we're doing it.

23:15.685 --> 23:16.561
He'll get over it.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.985
Is that milk?

23:25.487 --> 23:28.281
Maybe you can conjure up a cookie for me.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.743
You don't need a cookie,
but maybe you need a friend.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.997
I'm actually a really good listener.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.505
I thought I had it all figured out,
you know?

23:45.924 --> 23:46.842
Med school...

23:47.759 --> 23:50.262
couple years overseas saving lives,

23:50.345 --> 23:52.472
and then I'd set up a sweet practice.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.684
So that goes sideways,

23:56.226 --> 23:57.853
in a good way, with the whole...

23:59.771 --> 24:02.149
werewolf knights thing.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.234
And that was great.

24:04.901 --> 24:05.777
More than great.

24:06.862 --> 24:07.737
But now...

24:08.947 --> 24:10.449
Now you don't know who you are.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.492
The thing you thought you were,
you aren't anymore,

24:12.576 --> 24:15.620
and you can't figure out how or why
it happened, if you can ever get it back?

24:17.289 --> 24:18.415
No.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.292
I'm worried about some friends.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.461
But now I'm a little worried about you.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.379
I'm fine.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.214
What are some friends up to?

24:27.132 --> 24:29.050
It must suck when your magic doesn't work.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.512
Okay, whatever that nimrod told you...

24:35.849 --> 24:36.683
It does suck.

24:38.768 --> 24:39.603
Yeah.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.564
He's worried about you.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.568
The first kill is always the hardest.

24:47.444 --> 24:50.739
Especially if you never expected
there to be a first kill.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.367
Anyway.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.745
What are they up to?

24:58.830 --> 24:59.664
Nothing.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.792
Are you a diversion? Is that why
you're here? Are you diverting me?

25:02.876 --> 25:06.755
Wow. A guy goes out for a glass of 2%,
and all he gets is the third degree.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.423
Randall!

25:08.507 --> 25:09.508
Hey.

25:09.591 --> 25:10.926
-Randall.
-You guys.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.596
Busy here tonight.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.348
What's going on?

25:16.431 --> 25:18.391
Vera's preparing for a demon ritual.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.309
Oh, yeah?

25:19.392 --> 25:20.560
What's this one do?

25:21.061 --> 25:22.437
Decimate a village?

25:22.521 --> 25:23.897
Break up the Girl Guides?

25:23.980 --> 25:24.940
This one?

25:26.816 --> 25:28.568
What's the Order need with a demon anyhow?

25:29.444 --> 25:30.904
They've already got Vera.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.405
We're not summoning.

25:32.781 --> 25:33.907
We're containing.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.159
Eighty-one years ago, some idiot

25:36.243 --> 25:38.870
failed to follow the Order's first rule
of demon summoning.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.914
So now, every 27 years,

25:41.540 --> 25:42.624
we clean it up.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.462
There's a first rule of demon summoning?

25:48.129 --> 25:49.381
Well, it's the only rule.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.007
Don't.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.604
All this milk has made me sleepy.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.439
I gotta go.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.484
Bye.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.697
Zecchia, appear before us

26:13.780 --> 26:17.492
so that we may negotiate
the fee for your service

26:17.576 --> 26:21.204
to empty the vault
of the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose

26:21.288 --> 26:26.251
and remand those goods into the possession
of the Knights of Saint Christopher.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.213
Zecchia.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.593
Maybe we messed up the incantation?

26:35.343 --> 26:37.012
We did everything right.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.639
Guys! Don't do this!

26:39.723 --> 26:41.850
Alyssa and I were discussing
demon summonings, and--

26:41.933 --> 26:43.893
- You told her?
-I didn't tell her, per se.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.353
-The topic just came up.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.814
My point is,
even the Order doesn't summon demons.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.358
Because they learned their lesson.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.573
Unlike you noobs.

26:57.824 --> 26:58.742
So,

26:58.825 --> 27:01.411
first of all, thanks for nothing.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.747
Back in this shithole.

27:04.873 --> 27:05.749
Wait, you've...

27:06.499 --> 27:07.626
been here before?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.586
This realm, dummy.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.129
Your little patch of paradise.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.466
The only thing that redeems this dump
is the alcohol.

27:15.050 --> 27:15.925
So, second of all,

27:16.009 --> 27:16.843
give me.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.138
It's part of the price. Come on. Give me.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.182
You are Zecchia, our...

27:23.141 --> 27:24.559
Our thief demon, right?

27:25.143 --> 27:26.227
In the flesh.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.606
'Cause that's the only way
I can survive down here.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.566
Don't you mean up here?

27:32.067 --> 27:34.486
So fucking arrogant.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.281
How do we know she's who she says she is?

27:45.830 --> 27:48.416
It appears I am now flying commando.

27:49.084 --> 27:49.918
She's good.

27:50.001 --> 27:50.835
Mm-hm.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.216
So,

27:56.841 --> 27:59.552
you want me to rob the Order, huh?

28:00.136 --> 28:02.514
That's a big request. Expensive.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.475
We should go all-in and add the reliquary.

28:05.558 --> 28:06.685
<i>Obliviscere!</i>

28:08.395 --> 28:10.855
There's a protocol
when dealing with demons.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.983
Asking for anything additional
breaks the contract.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.444
<i>Obliviscere</i> cancels the ask.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.113
-Spoilsport.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.240
Is asking to go back
from where she came additional?

28:20.323 --> 28:21.366
<i>Obliviscere!</i>

28:22.325 --> 28:23.243
Fine.

28:23.952 --> 28:24.953
Whatever.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.455
Zecchia would like to go home,
so let's get with your program.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.375
Would it be breaking the contract
if we waited until tomorrow

28:31.042 --> 28:33.378
to wrap up some business?

28:33.461 --> 28:34.671
Business like what?

28:34.754 --> 28:36.589
You want to clear out our lockers,

28:36.673 --> 28:38.675
write a last piece of graffiti
on the washroom wall?

28:38.758 --> 28:42.554
This might be the end of our fake lives,
but not all of our feelings are fake.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.889
Well, I'm good to go.
I don't need any goodbyes.

28:44.973 --> 28:45.807
Couldn't care less.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.976
So that's what denial looks like.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.519
So can we?

28:54.941 --> 28:56.651
She can't go back to her realm

28:56.735 --> 28:58.486
till our request is satisfied.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.321
Fine.

29:00.822 --> 29:01.740
Standing by.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.367
Keeping these.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.203
Okay.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.831
We can find another way to do this, okay?

29:09.914 --> 29:11.541
It's not too late, right, guys?

29:11.624 --> 29:13.168
Guys!

29:19.632 --> 29:22.427
So, you're sorry for dating me?

29:22.844 --> 29:24.179
Is that what you're saying?

29:24.637 --> 29:25.597
Not sorry.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.140
Good.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.725
'Cause I'm not, either.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.936
I mean, I probably should be.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.438
You know, I'm your tutor, and--

29:33.938 --> 29:35.440
Unbalanced power dynamic.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.778
Also, I think the Grand Magus has a rule
about kissing in the temple.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.113
I'm going to make you sorry
that you know me.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.158
You couldn't, Lilith.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.911
It's just not possible.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.500
I need you to make this easier for me...

29:54.542 --> 29:55.668
not harder.

30:04.677 --> 30:06.012
You know why I chose this?

30:07.347 --> 30:08.932
All the violets I ever saw in my life,

30:09.015 --> 30:09.891
they were...

30:10.892 --> 30:12.519
well, violet.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.020
Or blue, and...

30:17.816 --> 30:18.691
this one...

30:19.818 --> 30:22.445
is just so sunny and bright.

30:22.529 --> 30:25.490
I especially love the dark center of it.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.034
You know?

30:28.117 --> 30:29.035
Hidden depths.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.080
I'm not an orange violet.

30:36.751 --> 30:37.669
Still there.

30:40.421 --> 30:43.049
I'm gonna be poison to you
in a couple of days, so...

30:51.891 --> 30:53.184
<i>Flos abi.</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:10.326
I'm firing you as my tutor.

31:12.245 --> 31:13.454
I'm sorry, but it's...

31:14.455 --> 31:16.291
It's better if you're not connected.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.002
I've been lying to you.

31:29.512 --> 31:32.473
The Order made us do this thing,
and it's been the worst.

31:33.474 --> 31:34.684
I've been the worst.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.896
It's called <i>pulvis memoriae.</i>

31:38.563 --> 31:39.772
It wipes your memory,

31:39.856 --> 31:42.567
and whenever you start
remembering stuff, I...

31:44.986 --> 31:47.405
I use this to reset you,

31:47.488 --> 31:49.198
so that you remain in the Order...

31:50.950 --> 31:51.826
so that they...

31:54.245 --> 31:56.748
<i>We</i> can control you.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.500
-I can't do it anymore.
-It doesn't work on me.

32:01.502 --> 32:02.837
It hasn't for a while now.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.175
So you know...

32:09.510 --> 32:10.511
and you're not mad at me?

32:10.595 --> 32:13.222
The Order makes us all do things
that we don't want to do.

32:16.976 --> 32:19.312
So in the temple,

32:20.021 --> 32:21.940
when you kissed me...

32:24.943 --> 32:25.944
That was really you?

32:27.570 --> 32:30.031
It turns out that

32:30.531 --> 32:32.408
my feelings for you

32:33.034 --> 32:35.620
are the same, no matter what I remember.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.973
We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we?

32:57.558 --> 32:58.393
Yeah.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.061
We are.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.320
I'll miss you.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.366
Are you speaking to the stemware?

33:15.451 --> 33:17.036
Dreaming up new recipes.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.330
Something gin-based, perhaps.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.208
Stay in the bourbon lane.

33:22.291 --> 33:25.003
That cocktail you made
the other night was delicious.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.671
Thank you.

33:27.964 --> 33:28.798
Thank <i>you.</i>

33:30.842 --> 33:32.593
I can make you another Grand Magus...

33:33.594 --> 33:34.429
if you like.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.852
Bring me something in a tall glass.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.532
You have excellent stalking skills.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.200
More hunting, actually.

33:56.868 --> 33:57.785
So, look--

33:57.869 --> 34:00.705
Thank you for telling Randall
about my catastrophic magic.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.040
I told Lilith.

34:02.623 --> 34:03.458
Not better.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.836
'Cause I thought she might have an idea
on how to help you, all right?

34:06.919 --> 34:09.672
And then I had to tell Hamish and Randall
or it would've seemed like--

34:09.756 --> 34:11.424
Like you didn't trust them?

34:11.507 --> 34:12.759
Like I was leaving them out.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.761
Because you didn't trust them.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.346
Oh, hey, Alyssa, is there something
you want to talk about?

34:17.430 --> 34:18.306
Trust, maybe?

34:18.973 --> 34:21.684
Randall was drinking milk
in the antechamber.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.102
Milk.

34:23.394 --> 34:25.730
And he was noticeably less manic.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.190
You idiots are up to something.

34:27.273 --> 34:28.775
Technically, <i>we're</i> not up to anything.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.693
You're making a move against the Order.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.278
It's not how I wanted to describe it--

34:32.361 --> 34:34.238
Whatever you're planning to do,
can you just not?

34:34.322 --> 34:36.324
I'll make sure Vera doesn't think
you're involved.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.492
I'm <i>not </i>involved!

34:37.575 --> 34:38.826
Not intentionally.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.498
So, we good, Alyssa?

34:44.207 --> 34:45.041
We good?

34:46.626 --> 34:47.710
Okay.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.465
So he's always had this place
and he chose to live at the den.

34:52.548 --> 34:55.384
Well, it's only got the one balcony.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.304
Sorry I'm late.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.015
-What happened to you?
-Nothing. What happened to you?

35:03.684 --> 35:04.977
Are we ready to go? Let's go.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.938
Yes, finally. Are we ready?

35:07.021 --> 35:09.273
-Good to go.
-I still think this is a bad idea.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.317
Your objection will be noted
in the minutes.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.860
We're supposed to keep minutes?

35:13.236 --> 35:14.278
Shall we?

35:15.905 --> 35:16.864
Zecchia,

35:16.948 --> 35:20.785
who sees each in its place and knows
the place in which each can hide,

35:20.868 --> 35:23.079
we ask you to steal from our enemies.

35:23.704 --> 35:26.415
Zecchia, we,
the Knights of Saint Christopher,

35:26.499 --> 35:28.459
do summon you to do our bidding,

35:28.543 --> 35:30.795
and no more nor less.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.964
Finally. You ready?

35:33.047 --> 35:34.298
We are. Are you?

35:34.632 --> 35:35.675
I was born ready.

35:36.467 --> 35:40.304
Although, technically, I wasn't born.
I spawned from the husk of a cosmic being,

35:40.388 --> 35:42.056
-one of thousands.
- Zecchia,

35:42.431 --> 35:44.183
you shall take all goods and chattel

35:44.267 --> 35:46.310
from the vault of the Hermetic Order
of the Blue Rose

35:46.394 --> 35:50.064
and remand these goods into the possession
of the Knights of Saint Christopher

35:50.148 --> 35:51.983
in this place we have anointed.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.575
Okay, so, how does she...

36:03.452 --> 36:04.620
This what you wanted?

36:05.246 --> 36:06.330
Uh, I think so, yeah.

36:06.414 --> 36:07.540
Contract fulfilled.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.796
It can't be this easy.

36:14.046 --> 36:14.964
It's that easy.

36:15.548 --> 36:16.424
Randall.

36:17.091 --> 36:18.342
You're going to wanna see this.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.428
Midnight!

36:20.511 --> 36:21.387
Midnight.

36:21.470 --> 36:22.638
We're free!

36:22.722 --> 36:24.724
We're free, motherfuckers!

36:24.807 --> 36:27.018
Free? We're in charge! Yeah!

36:34.066 --> 36:35.151
Don't. Don't.

36:51.417 --> 36:52.668
Ooh.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.343
-What?
-Try it.

37:00.426 --> 37:03.596
No, I'm not gonna...
No, I'm not gonna be able to do it.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.373
Imagine the hubris it must have taken

37:30.456 --> 37:33.793
to think you could summon
an emperor demon, let alone control it.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.796
Even the best of us overreach at times.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.967
Just because I want to see
the office of the Grand Magus

37:41.050 --> 37:42.510
executed in the proper fashion

37:42.593 --> 37:45.513
doesn't mean I don't admire
and trust your knowledge.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.099
"Doesn't mean I don't admire..."

37:48.641 --> 37:51.143
I've heard the stories
since I was an acolyte,

37:51.435 --> 37:54.730
and I am terrified that this demon
may come through.

37:55.982 --> 37:59.485
But it hasn't given me a reason to run,
Vera, because...

38:00.194 --> 38:01.028
of you.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.283
What I'm trying to say is...

38:06.742 --> 38:08.369
I'm glad you're handling it.

38:10.329 --> 38:11.163
Thank you.

38:14.041 --> 38:14.875
You're welcome.

38:23.342 --> 38:25.720
You can force him
back into his realm, right?

38:27.138 --> 38:28.389
It's nothing I can't handle.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.749
Congratulations, Bitsy.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.460
You just found a reason to run.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.548
Oh, demons are so scary.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.092
Okay, some demons are scary.

39:05.509 --> 39:08.387
We just confiscated
the Order's entire magic arsenal.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.349
I think the Knights of Saint Christopher
are back in business.

39:11.432 --> 39:15.186
So how do you want to tell the Order
that they take magic orders from us now?

39:15.269 --> 39:17.188
With big shit-eating grins on our faces.

39:17.271 --> 39:19.398
I second that. All in favor?

39:19.482 --> 39:20.900
-Aye.
-Aye.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.653
Okay, okay.

39:27.656 --> 39:28.574
Here it is.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.412
Vera is probably pissed.

39:42.963 --> 39:47.259
Jack, I just want to say I forgive you for
being such a burden these past few months.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.637
Well, what's going on? Did someone die?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.055
Not yet.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.432
Lilith!

39:53.974 --> 39:54.809
Nicky!

39:55.434 --> 39:56.602
I'm so glad we talked.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.814
The idea of dying
in the middle of a lie, I--

39:59.897 --> 40:01.023
Hey! Hey.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.525
No one's gonna die.

40:02.608 --> 40:06.070
Let me dispel the rumors.
We are all going to die.

40:06.737 --> 40:09.115
In less than 46 hours,

40:09.198 --> 40:13.786
a demon will break through the veil
between our realm and the demon realm.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.372
Now, it has long been
the Order's sworn duty

40:16.455 --> 40:19.250
to stand between humanity and this demon

40:19.333 --> 40:21.961
and escort him back
through the gates of Hell.

40:22.044 --> 40:23.838
But unfortunately...

40:25.339 --> 40:28.050
the weapons forged for this sole purpose
have vanished.

40:28.342 --> 40:31.053
She's hiding the fact that the vault's
been cleared out. That's smart.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.807
-Dude, are you hot for teacher?

40:36.767 --> 40:38.144
I admire good leadership.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.689
Jack. Can I talk to you for a second?

40:42.731 --> 40:43.691
You did this.

40:45.818 --> 40:48.612
So this is your way of getting back
at the Order? By killing everyone?

40:48.696 --> 40:50.197
We weren't trying to kill anyone.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.158
The Order took our stuff,
so we took it back.

40:52.241 --> 40:53.617
Yeah, along with everything else.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.328
Yeah, we're the Knights.
We fight bad magic, all right?

40:56.412 --> 40:58.497
Besides, I met a demon. It's no big deal.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.749
Rogwan is an emperor demon.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.376
The demon who controls fear.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.920
You know what he caused
the last time he got out? World War II.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.009
All right, well,
we'll bring back them... the...

41:10.092 --> 41:11.302
-The sickles.
-Sickles.

41:12.553 --> 41:15.931
So we went through all this trouble
just to give everything back?

41:16.015 --> 41:17.475
We're not giving anything back.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.894
We're lending them the artifacts
they need to do the job.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.188
Under the circumstances,
I think that's fair.

41:32.656 --> 41:33.491
Look...

41:34.033 --> 41:37.703
I'm not an "I told you so"
kind of guy, but...
