<i>This is Earth. You probably know that.</i>

00:58.494 --> 01:01.377
<i>You might've heard also
that humans were totally to blame</i>

01:01.457 --> 01:03.398
<i>for, like, everything that happened.</i>

01:06.202 --> 01:08.865
<i>They made the whole earth and sea unlivable.</i>

01:10.339 --> 01:14.106
<i>Then, they just up and left.
Left the whole planet to die.</i>

01:19.448 --> 01:23.317
<i>And we would've, too, if it wasn't
for my grandpa, the Kraken.</i>

01:24.453 --> 01:27.946
<i>Yep, that's him.
Except he's not really that terrifying.</i>

01:28.024 --> 01:29.356
<i>Most of the time anyway.</i>

01:32.161 --> 01:34.494
<i>Grandpa gathered all the creatures he could</i>

01:34.564 --> 01:37.398
<i>and led us to the only safe place left...</i>

01:37.466 --> 01:41.096
<i>a cave way down at the bottom of the ocean.</i>

01:46.175 --> 01:47.734
<i>That's it up ahead.</i>

01:57.720 --> 02:01.248
Yeah, it's okay. For a hole
at the bottom of the ocean

02:01.324 --> 02:03.953
that we're never, ever allowed to leave.

02:07.330 --> 02:08.320
Hey!

02:08.396 --> 02:10.627
To the banquet hall, everyone. On the double.

02:10.699 --> 02:15.468
Ohh, lucky you! You're about to
witness the event of a lifetime.

02:18.074 --> 02:20.441
Places, guys. Everyone ready?

02:20.509 --> 02:22.341
And lights.

02:29.185 --> 02:30.346
Nice!

02:32.722 --> 02:36.659
- Happy Survival Day, everyone.
- Oh, boy.

02:36.726 --> 02:37.955
Now, please direct your attention

02:38.027 --> 02:41.486
to the stage as we welcome
The Thunder From Deep Under,

02:41.564 --> 02:44.398
the giant cephalopod
that made this all possible,

02:44.467 --> 02:47.164
the one, the only, the Kraken.

02:50.406 --> 02:53.399
We made it alive through one more year.

02:53.476 --> 02:55.604
Let the feasting commence.

02:57.980 --> 02:59.676
Bravo.

02:59.749 --> 03:04.210
Citizens, this year we prepared
a very special menu,

03:04.287 --> 03:07.519
which I am sure you will all enjoy.

03:10.393 --> 03:12.692
Really? Again?

03:12.762 --> 03:15.391
Slime. Same as last year.

03:15.464 --> 03:17.365
It's the exact same thing as last year.

03:17.433 --> 03:19.459
Didn't I literally just say that?

03:21.304 --> 03:23.967
- Excuse me.
- Best day ever.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.838
You know what would make it good?

03:25.908 --> 03:27.968
If Kraken would let us go out there.

03:28.044 --> 03:29.307
We both know your grandpa, Deep.

03:29.378 --> 03:31.040
It'll never happen.

03:31.113 --> 03:33.776
Guys, quit talking about going out there.

03:33.849 --> 03:35.477
Out there is scary.

03:35.551 --> 03:37.315
Evo, what are you doing back there?

03:37.386 --> 03:39.582
- Hiding.
- From what? It's a party.

03:39.655 --> 03:42.147
- It's perfectly safe.
- For your information, Alice,

03:42.224 --> 03:44.955
the Cannibal Carnival
of '35 started as a party.

03:45.027 --> 03:48.191
All right, everybody, gift exchange. Whoopie.

03:48.264 --> 03:51.166
- Oh, Happy Survival Day.
- Happy Survival Day.

03:51.233 --> 03:53.862
- Happy Survival Day.
- Oh, thanks so much.

03:53.936 --> 03:55.427
Dude, Happy Survival Day, man.

03:55.504 --> 03:59.168
- How'd you know?
- Told ya. Same doo doo.

03:59.241 --> 04:00.641
Deja doo doo.

04:00.710 --> 04:03.646
But I have something not poopy
at all for my best friends.

04:03.713 --> 04:04.840
- Oh?
- Huh?

04:06.682 --> 04:07.877
Close your eyes.

04:07.950 --> 04:11.079
I know what that means. It's gonna be scary.

04:12.455 --> 04:14.720
Okay... open them.

04:16.892 --> 04:17.882
Told ya.

04:18.928 --> 04:21.226
- What's this?
- Your gifts.

04:21.297 --> 04:24.290
Okay. Any reason Evo got
a head and I got a butt?

04:24.367 --> 04:26.336
Alice, the butt is important, too.

04:26.402 --> 04:28.530
- If you don't have a butt...
- I know why you gave me this.

04:28.604 --> 04:30.163
You don't respect me because I'm small.

04:30.239 --> 04:33.334
That is so not true.
I've got a foot here, take it.

04:33.409 --> 04:36.038
Or I'll just get you something else
next time I go out.

04:36.112 --> 04:38.707
- The next time you go where?
- Uh-oh.

04:38.781 --> 04:41.216
What have I told you about going outside?

04:41.283 --> 04:43.514
You endanger all of us.

04:43.586 --> 04:48.957
And it's far, far worse because you are
my grandson and heir to the throne.

04:49.024 --> 04:51.493
Deep, you're impulsive and reckless.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.028
You only think of yourself.

04:53.095 --> 04:55.792
How will you ever take over one day?

04:55.865 --> 04:59.859
To keep us alive,
this colony needs a strong leader.

04:59.935 --> 05:02.336
But I don't want to just <i>be</i> alive, Grandpa.

05:02.405 --> 05:04.271
I want to <i>feel</i> alive.

05:04.340 --> 05:05.672
I'm telling you for the last time.

05:05.741 --> 05:08.734
Do not disappoint me again, Deep.

05:12.448 --> 05:14.474
Why can't he ever be proud of me?

05:15.584 --> 05:18.383
All right, party's over. We got work to do.

05:18.454 --> 05:19.922
I need volunteers.

05:19.989 --> 05:21.048
Oh, oh! Count me in! Me, me, me!

05:21.123 --> 05:22.648
Hello! Right here! Me, me, me!

05:22.725 --> 05:25.024
I need an entertainment,
uh, what do you call it?

05:26.028 --> 05:27.018
Coordinator?

05:27.096 --> 05:28.655
- Right. For dancing and...
- Singing!

05:28.731 --> 05:30.962
Oh, I'm a double-threat. One stop shopping.

05:32.735 --> 05:35.330
Okay, if there are no volunteers...

05:35.404 --> 05:37.270
- You!
- Who? Me?

05:37.339 --> 05:40.741
The coffinfish? So not fair.

05:40.810 --> 05:42.244
- Evo!
- Huh?

05:42.311 --> 05:45.907
Get that nightlight of yours over to
the nursery for sleepy time duty.

05:45.981 --> 05:48.177
Yay, babies. I'm on it.

05:49.852 --> 05:53.345
Deep, you're on filter duty.
The loofah needs to be cleaned.

05:53.422 --> 05:54.788
Abso-loofah-ly.

05:56.125 --> 05:59.027
As in...? You know what, forget it.

06:00.896 --> 06:03.365
Oh, oh! Hey, hey! What about me?

06:03.432 --> 06:05.128
Oh, I can't believe it.

06:05.201 --> 06:07.102
Sometimes it's like I'm not even here.

06:07.169 --> 06:11.038
Well, if you're not here, then I guess
no one will notice if you come with me.

06:12.575 --> 06:15.739
Deep, your grandpa's gonna punish you.

06:15.811 --> 06:18.610
Keeping me locked up down here,
he's already punishing me.

06:29.325 --> 06:30.850
- Coming?
- No-peedee-nope.

06:30.926 --> 06:32.952
- And you shouldn't either.
- Chicken.

06:33.028 --> 06:34.860
I happen to be a shrimp, thanks.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.468
Look at all this cool stuff. It's incredible!

06:40.536 --> 06:44.473
And who found it? Me!
I went outside and explored.

06:44.540 --> 06:45.906
I'm a pioneer.

06:47.076 --> 06:50.308
I bet this was a king's scepter.

06:50.379 --> 06:53.042
Deep! They just called
an emergency inspection.

06:53.115 --> 06:54.413
Did you change the filter? Huh?

06:55.618 --> 06:56.608
The loofah!

06:59.488 --> 07:01.047
Oh, where? Come on.

07:02.124 --> 07:04.389
Let's see. Oh, come on.

07:06.195 --> 07:07.219
Ah! This'll do!

07:13.269 --> 07:17.206
There. So clean you'll have to come up
with a new word to describe it.

07:17.273 --> 07:20.641
- Bubbles!
- Weird choice, but okay.

07:20.709 --> 07:25.409
- Look how bubbles the water is.
- No, Deep. Bubbles!

07:26.582 --> 07:27.572
Um...

07:27.650 --> 07:28.811
Ah...

07:29.985 --> 07:30.975
Oh...

07:32.821 --> 07:35.222
Hey, where do think you're going?

07:37.893 --> 07:41.830
It's always something with you.
Come back here, Deep!

07:50.806 --> 07:53.105
Deep!

07:53.175 --> 07:56.270
- Cool!
- Hey.

07:59.848 --> 08:02.010
Now it's time to peacefully...

08:04.653 --> 08:06.815
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:11.927 --> 08:14.226
Don't drop the baby. Don't drop the... agh!

08:15.497 --> 08:18.695
Come back here, Deep!

08:22.571 --> 08:24.233
Now I want the truth and don't lie.

08:24.306 --> 08:27.071
I can see right through you.

08:27.142 --> 08:29.976
Okay. I did steal 40 million eggs.

08:30.045 --> 08:33.504
I just didn't think anyone could
responsibly raise that many kids.

08:33.582 --> 08:36.347
Return them now. Next case.

08:38.187 --> 08:40.486
Excuse me, Kraken? Sir.

08:40.556 --> 08:45.995
Sorry to report someone replaced
the filter with a man-made sponge.

08:46.061 --> 08:49.054
On the plus side,
the colony does smell lemony fresh.

08:50.599 --> 08:52.659
Fix it now!

09:00.042 --> 09:02.807
Maybe you should avoid
your grandfather for just a bit.

09:04.313 --> 09:07.806
Alice, I'm thinking I better stay away
from my grandpa for a while.

09:07.883 --> 09:09.681
Oh, great idea.
Where'd you come up with that?

09:09.752 --> 09:11.345
Huh?

09:16.358 --> 09:18.020
What's happening in my room?

09:22.097 --> 09:24.328
- Grandpa, Grandpa! That's my stuff!
- Whoa!

09:25.434 --> 09:28.734
I will not have the outside
world influence you anymore!

09:29.838 --> 09:30.862
Hey!

09:30.939 --> 09:32.874
- Stop it!
- Enough!

09:32.941 --> 09:35.467
Everyone in this colony
is a member of a team.

09:35.544 --> 09:38.036
We support each other.
We listen to each other.

09:38.113 --> 09:40.173
It's how we've survived all these years.

09:40.249 --> 09:43.111
And if you're not working with the team,
you're working against it.

09:43.185 --> 09:46.849
So tell me Deep,
are you a team player, or not?

09:46.922 --> 09:48.185
Grandpa, I...

09:49.825 --> 09:51.953
Yes. Think about it.

09:52.027 --> 09:55.122
And in the meantime, stay in your room.

09:55.197 --> 09:59.100
I don't want to see you until
you've counted to 10,000.

10:01.804 --> 10:04.797
Grandpa's right. I'm a disappointment.

10:04.873 --> 10:06.466
But if I had listened to Grandpa,

10:06.542 --> 10:09.740
I never would've found any of
these priceless human artifacts.

10:11.447 --> 10:12.676
Oh, wait! I almost forgot.

10:13.949 --> 10:16.350
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,000!

10:16.418 --> 10:17.943
So I never paid attention in math.

10:20.856 --> 10:24.486
Thank you, Alfonso.
You're a great dancer, too.

10:29.998 --> 10:32.968
Hey, weren't you supposed to
count to 10,000 hundred million?

10:33.035 --> 10:36.528
I did. Sorta. And now,
I'm gonna have some fun.

10:36.605 --> 10:38.437
Hey, Alice, wanna come?

10:38.507 --> 10:40.203
Sure, Deep. Thanks for asking.

10:41.610 --> 10:45.775
So the little fishy went
swimming through the blue water.

10:45.848 --> 10:48.147
And the fishy said...

10:48.217 --> 10:49.446
Sorry.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.749
And the little fishy said...

10:52.921 --> 10:54.947
Come on. Let's go explore.

10:55.023 --> 10:57.720
Explore? Deep, who are you talking to?

10:57.793 --> 10:59.659
Good point. Have fun in the dark.

10:59.728 --> 11:01.253
Sweet dreams.

11:06.702 --> 11:09.297
So, the fishy continued,
wondering what was next.

11:09.371 --> 11:12.773
Maybe dangers? Weird creatures
with razor-sharp claws?

11:12.841 --> 11:16.175
And poison tentacles and terrifying screams?

11:16.245 --> 11:17.645
Get me out of here.

11:24.186 --> 11:26.417
- Deep!
- Ouch! Oh, hi, Evo.

11:26.488 --> 11:28.923
Whew! That nursery's a horror show.

11:28.991 --> 11:31.517
- Shall we?
- Huh? No.

11:31.593 --> 11:33.118
Alice, aren't you going to stop him?

11:33.195 --> 11:36.654
No. Frankly, I'm a little
curious what's out there.

11:36.732 --> 11:40.100
Besides, it's not like
anyone'll notice I'm gone.

11:40.169 --> 11:41.159
Huh?

11:46.074 --> 11:51.308
Whoa! I always imagined
outside being... smaller.

11:51.380 --> 11:54.873
Hey, guys! Check this out. It's totally cool.

11:54.950 --> 11:56.919
Yeah!

11:59.988 --> 12:01.388
What's that?

12:01.456 --> 12:02.685
That's your shadow.

12:02.758 --> 12:04.920
Look, shine your light against these rocks.

12:04.993 --> 12:05.983
Huh?

12:06.995 --> 12:08.588
See? Nothing to be scared of.

12:10.866 --> 12:12.960
Wow. Wish I was that big.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.701
Sorry.

12:20.776 --> 12:23.507
- What is that thing?
- Oh, come on.

12:23.579 --> 12:27.175
Everybody knows this is a... hat.

12:28.383 --> 12:30.682
And this is a boat motor.

12:30.752 --> 12:34.519
- What's a boat?
- This is the boat.

12:34.590 --> 12:36.718
You sure, Deep? Looks dangerous.

12:36.792 --> 12:39.455
Please! I know better than you guys.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.057
Deep!

12:49.738 --> 12:50.762
Yee-haw!

12:50.839 --> 12:52.432
Stop clowning around, Deep.

12:52.507 --> 12:55.136
No fun... no life, Evo.

12:55.210 --> 12:56.337
Come on, Alice.

13:01.316 --> 13:02.750
You know, I think you're right, Deep.

13:02.818 --> 13:05.049
Doesn't seem dangerous out here at all.

13:08.090 --> 13:09.752
Okay, that's a bit much.

13:13.362 --> 13:14.352
Jump, Alice!

13:19.368 --> 13:20.358
Um...

13:35.517 --> 13:38.419
What was that? Did you fart again, Ramiro?

13:38.487 --> 13:39.750
Huh?

13:46.995 --> 13:48.156
Back to the colony!

13:54.970 --> 13:56.905
Everyone, together.

13:56.972 --> 13:59.271
We have to evacuate. Leave no one behind.

14:04.947 --> 14:06.609
Oh, no!

14:06.682 --> 14:07.706
Go, go, go!

14:27.970 --> 14:30.030
- Come on!
- Go!

14:30.105 --> 14:31.903
Oh, no!

14:35.844 --> 14:37.107
Everyone out!

14:38.447 --> 14:39.608
Let's go!

14:42.918 --> 14:44.409
- Come on.
- Hurry.

14:54.463 --> 14:56.557
Oh, we are trapped.

14:56.631 --> 14:58.224
What have I done?

14:58.300 --> 15:00.166
Deep, where are you?

15:00.235 --> 15:03.296
Grandpa, we're outside. Are you all right?

15:03.372 --> 15:06.900
- Yes, we're trapped, but alive.
- Now we'll get you out.

15:06.975 --> 15:10.571
Citizens, I need everyone's
help to move these rocks.

15:19.588 --> 15:21.750
It's useless.

15:21.823 --> 15:25.419
If all of us together can't
move these rocks, there's no chance.

15:25.494 --> 15:28.259
But, Grandpa, this is all my fault.

15:28.330 --> 15:31.562
I left the abyss, and then... I'm so sorry.

15:31.633 --> 15:33.625
- There's got to be a way.
- What?

15:33.702 --> 15:37.400
- No, it is impossible.
- What? What, Grandpa, what?

15:37.472 --> 15:39.532
I don't know if he's still alive.

15:39.608 --> 15:42.908
And even so, the seas are so vast,
you would never find him.

15:42.978 --> 15:45.004
Find who, Grandpa? Who?

15:45.080 --> 15:47.845
My old friend, Nathan. The white whale.

15:47.916 --> 15:51.250
He's the only creature big enough
to move these rocks and save us.

15:51.319 --> 15:53.379
- Where is he?
- I'm not sure.

15:53.455 --> 15:57.017
But when I brought the colony down here,
Nathan had to stay behind.

15:57.092 --> 16:00.893
- That was in the City of Men.
- City of Men. We're on it.

16:00.962 --> 16:02.863
- We?
- Wait.

16:02.931 --> 16:04.661
You don't know where the City of Men is.

16:04.733 --> 16:08.363
- Good point.
- Go west, past the Wall of Doom,

16:08.437 --> 16:11.771
continue past the sleeping giant,
and through the lron Mountains.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.072
And be quick, boy.
I don't know how long we can last.

16:15.143 --> 16:17.305
Don't worry, Grandfather.
I'll make it right again.

16:17.379 --> 16:20.713
I promise. Come on, guys.

16:20.782 --> 16:25.049
I'll just stay here and make sure
no one tries to get in.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.682
Evo, if we don't go with Deep,
he'll probably mess up again.

16:28.757 --> 16:30.157
Then where will we be?

16:30.225 --> 16:33.718
- Okay, you make a good point.
- Look, we stay together.

16:33.795 --> 16:35.423
I look out for you, you look out for me.

16:35.497 --> 16:37.489
- Huh?
- Deal?

16:37.566 --> 16:39.159
Hey, Deep, wait up.

16:44.973 --> 16:48.171
Wow, it's endless.

16:50.078 --> 16:52.513
What's everyone so scared about here anyway?

16:52.581 --> 16:55.642
There's nothing here.
Hey, Evo, look out behind you.

16:55.717 --> 16:57.481
It's a nothing.

16:57.552 --> 16:58.679
Where?

16:59.688 --> 17:00.747
Alice, run!

17:00.822 --> 17:03.587
Evo, calm down.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

17:03.658 --> 17:05.490
That's what I'm afraid of.

17:06.928 --> 17:09.954
So funny. Oh, my sides.

17:10.031 --> 17:11.829
Guys, we've got a job here.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.131
We can't be bothered by a little nothing.

17:14.202 --> 17:17.172
What about a big <i>something</i> ?

17:17.239 --> 17:22.473
- Oh, the Wall of Doom.
- They just <i>had</i> to call it that.

17:22.544 --> 17:27.107
Couldn't call it the Mural of Mirth
or the Facade of Fairy Cakes.

17:27.182 --> 17:29.014
Relax, we'll go around it.

17:29.084 --> 17:31.519
The Kraken said go through it. Let's go.

17:32.521 --> 17:34.387
No. He said, whatever we do,

17:34.456 --> 17:36.550
when we get to the Wall of Doom, go around.

17:36.625 --> 17:40.392
He totally said, "Make sure you
do <i>not</i> go around it. Go through."

17:40.462 --> 17:41.794
- Around.
- Through.

17:41.863 --> 17:44.264
- Around!
- Through!

17:44.332 --> 17:46.824
I heard him say,
"When you get to the Wall of Doom,

17:46.902 --> 17:49.667
just come back home.
It'll be fine. We'll have cake."

17:50.805 --> 17:51.898
What?

17:51.973 --> 17:53.566
Look, just follow my lead, guys.

17:53.642 --> 17:55.634
This whole mess is my responsibility.

17:55.710 --> 17:57.338
Just follow me.

17:57.412 --> 17:58.812
Oh, boy.

18:00.582 --> 18:02.551
Okay, smarty tentacles. Now what?

18:03.885 --> 18:05.911
Okay, we all go in together. On three.

18:05.987 --> 18:08.923
One, two, three.

18:10.926 --> 18:12.986
- You didn't go in.
- Neither did you.

18:13.061 --> 18:14.120
I'm directing.

18:14.196 --> 18:16.893
Guys, the colony's counting on us.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.627
Right. One, two, three, go!

18:23.672 --> 18:25.937
All right! See? That wasn't so bad.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.307
Wait, where's Evo?

18:34.716 --> 18:36.810
- What are we screaming at?
- Oh.

18:36.885 --> 18:39.081
Okay, that looks like
the way to the other side.

18:39.154 --> 18:40.884
Alice, you take the one over there,

18:40.956 --> 18:43.824
I'll take the one over here,
and Evo, you take the middle,

18:43.892 --> 18:45.451
and we'll meet on the other side.

18:45.527 --> 18:48.827
All right, team. Are you gonna
let down the Kraken, the colony?

18:48.897 --> 18:49.887
No!

18:49.965 --> 18:53.197
Then let's put on our game faces
and get out of here.

19:22.597 --> 19:25.499
That was fun. Let's do it again.

19:26.935 --> 19:28.164
Hey!

19:28.236 --> 19:29.932
Look at that, everyone.

19:30.005 --> 19:31.598
It is alive?

19:31.673 --> 19:33.232
Maybe it's Nathan.

19:33.308 --> 19:35.038
Great, then we're all done.

19:36.077 --> 19:37.272
Follow us, Nathan.

19:37.345 --> 19:38.904
- Race you home.
- Wait!

19:38.980 --> 19:40.505
That's no whale.

19:43.285 --> 19:46.346
This must be the sleeping giant
Grandpa told us about.

19:47.989 --> 19:49.287
You'll wake him up.

19:49.357 --> 19:52.259
Come on, maybe someone
inside can tell us how to go...

19:52.327 --> 19:54.193
Or rip us into confetti.

19:57.332 --> 20:00.427
Whoa, what an entrance!

20:00.502 --> 20:02.630
Now, how about an exit?

20:04.072 --> 20:05.973
Something moved. Over that way.

20:12.047 --> 20:14.141
Lots to look at.

20:15.150 --> 20:16.812
And plenty to fear.

20:21.756 --> 20:23.315
- What were they?
- I don't know,

20:23.391 --> 20:25.257
but they were horrible looking.

20:25.327 --> 20:26.659
I'll see if they're still there.

20:35.236 --> 20:37.330
Hey, I did it. Guys, check this out.

20:37.405 --> 20:41.137
- It's really cool.
- What do they want from us?

20:41.209 --> 20:42.199
That one's cute.

20:43.712 --> 20:45.510
That one looks kind of dumb.

20:45.580 --> 20:48.140
Don't you guys get it? They're us.

20:51.886 --> 20:54.151
That's a relief.

20:54.222 --> 20:55.656
Stop staring at me.

20:57.726 --> 20:58.716
Someone's there.

21:01.229 --> 21:07.931
Yes, 'tis Norma! The most glamorous
vampire octopus in the world.

21:08.002 --> 21:10.870
You've heard of me, of course.

21:10.939 --> 21:13.340
Uh... not really.

21:13.408 --> 21:15.377
Maybe she used to be big.

21:15.443 --> 21:19.539
I <i>am</i> big. It's the <i>Titanic</i> that got small.

21:19.614 --> 21:23.244
Well, not really. I take that part back.

21:23.318 --> 21:28.052
Hi. I'm Deep and oh... this is Evo and Alice.

21:28.123 --> 21:29.591
We're sort of new here.

21:29.657 --> 21:33.856
Oh, fans come to worship me, at last.

21:36.297 --> 21:38.630
We need to find the City of Men, quickly.

21:38.700 --> 21:42.728
- Do you know the way?
- Oh, the City of Men.

21:43.738 --> 21:49.644
Where I made my triumphant stage debut
in a huge glass palace.

21:50.945 --> 21:55.041
<i>The humans would applaud
and applaud and applaud.</i>

21:55.116 --> 21:56.106
<i>Norma...</i>

21:56.184 --> 21:58.710
- We're in a little hurry, so...
- Do not interrupt.

21:58.787 --> 22:04.158
Oh, I was worshiped,
pursued by love-struck admirers.

22:04.225 --> 22:06.490
For example, the Count over there.

22:06.561 --> 22:09.690
Sadly, he no longer does much seducing.

22:09.764 --> 22:11.824
But what cheekbones.

22:13.435 --> 22:16.667
Hey, maybe you could light up my life.

22:16.738 --> 22:18.969
What you do say, handsome?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.066
I'm-I'm-I'm afraid of commitment.

22:22.844 --> 22:24.210
Make that terrified.

22:25.380 --> 22:28.316
But all that was so long ago.

22:28.383 --> 22:30.909
Before humans made the seas...

22:32.120 --> 22:33.850
and ruined my career.

22:34.856 --> 22:39.590
So I wandered the seas
until I found this wonderful home.

22:39.661 --> 22:44.190
Except no one comes to visit... until now.

22:44.265 --> 22:47.064
Yeah, we'd love to stay,
but thanks for everything.

22:47.135 --> 22:48.501
We really have to be on our way.

22:48.570 --> 22:53.270
- See, our colony is in danger and...
- Oh, but you can't.

22:53.341 --> 22:54.331
And why?

22:55.944 --> 22:59.005
You're right on time for my one-woman show.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.141
And no one leaves in
the middle of a performance.

23:02.217 --> 23:03.651
Or else.

23:06.321 --> 23:08.153
Look for exits.

23:08.223 --> 23:09.885
There aren't any. What do we do?

23:09.958 --> 23:15.488
And now the beautiful, the sublime... Norma.

23:15.563 --> 23:19.261
Oh, please, you're too kind.
Thank you all ever so much.

23:28.443 --> 23:30.674
<i>The others are gone</i>

23:30.745 --> 23:33.112
<i>But I still go on</i>

23:33.181 --> 23:37.710
<i>I'm Queen of the Undersea Ball</i>

23:37.785 --> 23:39.777
<i>You may see decay</i>

23:39.854 --> 23:41.880
<i>But I like it that way</i>

23:41.956 --> 23:46.451
<i>For I'm Queen of the Undersea Ball</i>

23:50.265 --> 23:53.133
- I think it's kind of catchy.
- Are you crazy?

23:53.201 --> 23:54.863
- Let's get out of here.
- We can't yet.

23:54.936 --> 23:57.428
You heard her. She came from the City of Men.

23:57.505 --> 23:59.269
We need to find out where it is.

24:01.175 --> 24:02.973
<i>Fathoms below</i>

24:03.044 --> 24:05.343
<i>An H2O show</i>

24:05.413 --> 24:10.215
<i>This watery diva's a star</i>

24:10.285 --> 24:14.552
<i>My fame soon will spread wide and far</i>

24:14.622 --> 24:18.024
<i>For you see that I am what I are</i>

24:19.794 --> 24:21.854
<i>An iceberg once sunk it
But who would have thunk it</i>

24:21.930 --> 24:23.455
<i>This ship is the place I prefer</i>

24:23.531 --> 24:25.022
<i>The boat is a wreck</i>

24:25.099 --> 24:26.431
<i>But I say, what the heck</i>

24:26.501 --> 24:28.868
<i>I have my new fans, his and her</i>

24:28.937 --> 24:31.532
Hello, sailor.

24:31.606 --> 24:33.438
<i>I've glamor and class</i>

24:33.508 --> 24:36.342
<i>Occasional gas</i>

24:36.411 --> 24:40.178
<i>But that is just part of my charm</i>

24:40.248 --> 24:42.080
<i>The others are gone</i>

24:42.150 --> 24:44.278
<i>But I still go on</i>

24:44.352 --> 24:49.586
<i>And on, and on, and on,
and on, and on, and on</i>

24:49.657 --> 24:52.092
<i>And on!</i>

24:59.667 --> 25:00.965
Floating ovation.

25:01.035 --> 25:03.504
- Marvelous.
- Encore! Again, again!

25:03.571 --> 25:05.506
More? Are you out of your mind?

25:05.573 --> 25:06.666
I've got a plan.

25:08.209 --> 25:09.871
Encore. More, more!

25:09.944 --> 25:11.173
Oh, I blush.

25:11.245 --> 25:14.579
- How about some improv?
- Splendid. What shall I be?

25:14.649 --> 25:17.778
A young actress on her way
to the City of Men.

25:17.852 --> 25:21.721
Oh, I remember it like it was yesterday.

25:21.789 --> 25:24.520
Suitcase packed and I'm setting off

25:24.592 --> 25:28.495
for the City's grandest boulevard...
Broadway.

25:28.563 --> 25:34.127
- And how do you get to Broadway?
- Practice, my boy, practice.

25:34.202 --> 25:37.764
I mean, which way do you swim?
From here, that is.

25:37.839 --> 25:41.367
Oh, along the warm westerly current,
of course.

25:41.442 --> 25:44.776
See it? Whoa, here I go.

25:44.846 --> 25:48.010
- Westerly current. Got it.
- How long does your trip take?

25:48.082 --> 25:52.383
Six days of pure anticipation,
with a quick stop for a kiss

25:52.453 --> 25:54.354
with a devilishly handsome shark

25:54.422 --> 25:57.187
on the Island of Trash
near the lron Mountain.

25:57.258 --> 26:00.990
Island of Trash. Iron Mountain.
And then you're there?

26:01.062 --> 26:04.294
No, first I float through the Coral Canyon.

26:04.365 --> 26:06.994
Oh, so beautiful.

26:08.069 --> 26:09.697
Now the Long Island.

26:09.771 --> 26:13.367
Then the Great Bridge
at the foot of the city.

26:13.441 --> 26:17.310
Whoops, there goes my suitcase.

26:17.378 --> 26:19.279
Coral Canyon, Long Island, Big Bridge.

26:19.347 --> 26:20.940
We've got it. Move.

26:22.050 --> 26:24.144
What? I hardly started.

26:25.486 --> 26:28.456
No one swims out on Norma.

26:37.799 --> 26:40.098
My fans are fans to the end.

26:40.168 --> 26:42.637
Which will happen sooner than you think,

26:42.704 --> 26:45.799
for I will destroy you!

26:49.777 --> 26:50.767
What do we do?

26:51.846 --> 26:53.007
Follow my lead.

26:54.082 --> 26:55.846
You call that acting?

26:55.917 --> 26:59.285
I've seen scarier
performances from clownfish.

26:59.353 --> 27:01.379
Yeah, I give you half a starfish.

27:01.456 --> 27:05.291
- I kind of liked it.
- Shh! Play along.

27:05.359 --> 27:06.588
Boo!

27:08.196 --> 27:09.630
Imbeciles!

27:09.697 --> 27:14.032
You wouldn't know art if it
scaled, breaded, and fried you.

27:14.102 --> 27:17.664
You bottom feeders, get out.

27:21.776 --> 27:23.244
There! An exit.

27:23.311 --> 27:26.110
No, wait. Come back!

27:32.987 --> 27:35.218
I really don't want to see this.

27:55.743 --> 27:59.680
No, don't go!

28:00.681 --> 28:03.617
Fine! Forget you.

28:03.684 --> 28:08.987
Who cares? I don't need you.
I still have my adoring public.

28:15.363 --> 28:18.231
Oh, my gosh. Glad we got
out of there with our lives.

28:20.835 --> 28:22.133
Okay, now what?

28:22.203 --> 28:25.537
Norma said to take the warm westerly
to the lron Mountain.

28:25.606 --> 28:28.599
Hey, feel it? Warm currents.

28:28.676 --> 28:32.841
- The warm westerly.
- Sorry, I couldn't hold it anymore.

28:32.914 --> 28:35.679
Gross, Evo!

28:35.750 --> 28:36.774
There.

28:36.851 --> 28:40.344
Wow, it's like a hill of steel.

28:40.421 --> 28:44.188
Maybe someone inside the hill of steel
can tell us where the lron Mountain is.

28:45.193 --> 28:46.320
What?

28:46.394 --> 28:49.660
Okay, looks like we go over
and keep heading west.

28:49.730 --> 28:52.894
That should take us to the Long Island
and then the Big Bridge.

28:52.967 --> 28:54.526
We got this guys.

28:58.706 --> 29:01.039
- We lost the current.
- I feel it.

29:01.108 --> 29:02.167
This way!

29:02.243 --> 29:03.336
Deep!

29:21.195 --> 29:23.494
I... hi.

29:23.564 --> 29:26.363
- How are you?
- I'm hungry.

29:26.434 --> 29:28.403
Oh, well, maybe I could help you.

29:28.469 --> 29:31.906
Yeah, stay still so I can
get you down in one bite.

29:31.973 --> 29:33.532
Don't you know who you're eating?

29:33.608 --> 29:36.373
Nah. It takes all the romance out of it.

29:36.444 --> 29:39.380
Wait! Um... I'm a very important octopus

29:39.447 --> 29:41.712
and if you eat me,
my friends will be very mad.

29:41.782 --> 29:43.375
Friends!

29:43.451 --> 29:45.613
Very mad friends!

29:45.686 --> 29:48.520
- That's your cue.
- M-m-my cue?

29:48.589 --> 29:50.319
Oh, so you have friends?

29:50.391 --> 29:54.829
Oh, yeah, really good friends,
and they're right over...

29:57.798 --> 29:59.926
Are you crying?

30:00.001 --> 30:02.596
I've never had a friend.

30:02.670 --> 30:06.232
I live in garbage. I haven't
seen another living thing in

30:06.307 --> 30:08.105
I don't know how many years.

30:08.175 --> 30:13.478
Oh, well, we're living things.
Maybe we could be friends?

30:13.547 --> 30:16.711
Right, except now I want to eat you.

30:16.784 --> 30:18.480
Don't you see the problem?

30:18.552 --> 30:21.078
Oh, what am I gonna do?

30:21.155 --> 30:23.181
- Well, if you ask me...
- Eat them.

30:24.325 --> 30:27.056
No, they aren't food, they're friends.

30:27.128 --> 30:28.357
Delicious looking friends.

30:29.363 --> 30:31.798
If you eat your friends,
they won't want to be friends with you.

30:31.866 --> 30:33.164
Fine.

30:33.234 --> 30:34.896
Now get it together.

30:34.969 --> 30:37.404
- Deep, let's move.
- Which way's the current?

30:37.471 --> 30:39.337
Who cares! Let's just get out of here.

30:40.608 --> 30:42.236
Hi, guys.

30:42.310 --> 30:44.745
Look, really sorry about that back there.

30:44.812 --> 30:47.543
It's so embarrassing.
Let's start over, could we?

30:47.615 --> 30:49.174
My name's Maura. Charmed.

30:50.818 --> 30:54.721
I'm Deep. This is Evo and Alice.

30:54.789 --> 30:56.724
We're on our way west to the City of Men.

30:56.791 --> 31:00.558
- So, we got to like...
- Run for our lives. Toodle-oo.

31:00.628 --> 31:02.620
That's a dangerous trip. I can help you.

31:02.697 --> 31:04.290
I can protect you against predators.

31:04.365 --> 31:07.460
- You are a predator.
- I mean way worse predators.

31:07.535 --> 31:10.232
And look, I will 100% not eat you at all.

31:10.304 --> 31:12.466
My word's my bond. Please, can I come?

31:12.540 --> 31:14.099
- Well...
- Please?

31:14.175 --> 31:17.009
- I...
- Don't leave me alone.

31:17.078 --> 31:18.706
Well, we...

31:18.779 --> 31:20.008
See...

31:25.319 --> 31:27.652
- Whatever, come on.
- Deep!

31:28.656 --> 31:31.649
Excuse me, it's Maura, isn't it? Lovely name.

31:31.726 --> 31:33.854
Can I get a quick word with
my colleague here, please?

31:37.598 --> 31:38.998
Are you out of your mind?

31:40.101 --> 31:43.230
Do you have any idea how many friends
she's probably eaten?

31:44.605 --> 31:46.471
Excuse me.

31:47.575 --> 31:50.170
Didn't you hear her? No eating, 100%.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.076
You can't beat 100%

31:53.080 --> 31:55.743
Come on, she's got an honest face.

31:55.816 --> 31:57.375
And an unhingeable jaw!

31:58.452 --> 32:02.583
I say she's in. Okay, team, let's move.

32:02.656 --> 32:03.988
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

32:04.058 --> 32:06.892
I don't know what to say.
You got it, sir. Thank you, sir.

32:08.295 --> 32:10.457
Friends don't eat friends.
Friends don't eat friends.

32:10.531 --> 32:12.693
Friends don't eat friends.

32:18.072 --> 32:20.473
Citizens, help is on the way.

32:20.541 --> 32:22.976
Deep will find Nathan. I give you my word.

32:23.044 --> 32:25.013
Just remain calm and...

32:26.414 --> 32:27.848
- What is it?
- Oh no, nothing.

32:27.915 --> 32:31.044
- Forget it. No worries.
- No, what it is it that's so important

32:31.118 --> 32:33.519
that you interrupted me?

32:33.587 --> 32:36.455
Maybe you and I should talk over there?

32:36.524 --> 32:38.550
There are no secrets in my colonies.

32:38.626 --> 32:39.616
Speak.

32:39.693 --> 32:41.127
I don't want to impose.

32:41.195 --> 32:45.792
Come up here, next to me,
right now, and say your piece, citizen.

32:45.866 --> 32:47.630
- Really?
- Just do it.

32:47.701 --> 32:51.968
Oh, hey. Hi, everybody.
Um, another big crack opened.

32:52.039 --> 32:54.531
More lava's pouring in,
ain't no way to stop it.

32:54.608 --> 32:56.634
Pretty sure we're toast.

33:04.385 --> 33:07.480
What have I done?
Was it a mistake to trust Deep?

33:10.124 --> 33:11.649
Keep up the pace, guys.

33:11.725 --> 33:14.752
Deep, we've been swimming for hours.

33:16.330 --> 33:18.128
Oh, I'm so hungry.

33:18.199 --> 33:20.259
- Ouch.
- What's your problem, guy?

33:20.334 --> 33:23.761
I'll tell you one thing, it's definitely
not that I'm afraid of you'll eat me.

33:23.838 --> 33:25.898
Relax, I'm not into lanternfish.

33:25.973 --> 33:28.909
If I want to become bioluminescent,
I'll swallow a light bulb, okay?

33:28.976 --> 33:30.467
Not afraid at all.

33:34.181 --> 33:38.448
Come on, guys.
We'll take a break when... Whoa!

33:39.653 --> 33:42.213
How could the Kraken have
kept me from all this?

33:45.826 --> 33:47.488
Maybe we can just...

33:47.561 --> 33:50.121
stop and enjoy this for a while?

33:50.197 --> 33:51.688
No, we need to push on.

33:51.765 --> 33:54.701
Of course, that's what I meant
when I suggested stopping.

33:54.768 --> 33:55.997
Let's go even faster.

33:56.070 --> 33:58.596
Not really an award winner
in listening skills, is he?

33:58.672 --> 34:01.207
- Huh, you noticed?
- Whoa!

34:02.977 --> 34:06.038
Deep, can we take a break?

34:06.113 --> 34:08.047
Hey, Deep, we're exhausted here.

34:08.114 --> 34:12.518
So tired, so thirsty. Water, water.

34:12.585 --> 34:16.023
- But we're already in the water.
- Right, that's the joke.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.788
What do they call an octopus
with a bad sense of humor?

34:19.860 --> 34:22.386
- Dinner.
- Now that's funny.

34:23.531 --> 34:25.226
Hey, guys, I have an idea.

34:25.299 --> 34:28.030
We should rest here. It's so beautiful.

34:28.101 --> 34:31.937
- I'm exhausted. Let's take a break.
- Finally.

34:32.005 --> 34:33.702
- That's what we've been saying all along.
- That's what we've been telling you.

34:33.774 --> 34:35.402
- Nobody cares.
- Okay, okay!

34:35.476 --> 34:37.603
All you had to do was say something.

34:39.679 --> 34:43.014
So, let's put the ladies down here
and Evo and I will sleep up top.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.484
- I'm fine up here.
- I'll be the watch fish.

34:45.553 --> 34:47.181
I won't sleep anyway.

34:47.254 --> 34:50.053
Maybe one of your bedtime stories
will make you sleepy.

34:50.123 --> 34:52.958
Really? Hmm. Okay.

34:53.027 --> 34:57.089
So, once upon a time
there was this brave fish.

34:57.164 --> 34:59.497
Was it a lanternfish by any chance?

34:59.567 --> 35:03.265
Yes, in fact. But no interrupting,
Deep, or you get a time out.

35:03.337 --> 35:06.205
Anyway, this lanternfish, Revo was his name,

35:06.273 --> 35:10.540
he was so brave, he could swim anywhere.

35:12.346 --> 35:15.680
The guy was totally fearless.

35:15.749 --> 35:21.052
He could, like, take on any enemies...

35:23.324 --> 35:26.055
Praise Neptune.
He was working on my last nerve.

35:27.428 --> 35:30.694
You were right, Deep.
It sure is beautiful out here.

35:30.764 --> 35:34.531
Yeah, I hope one day I can
show my grandfather this.

35:34.602 --> 35:36.764
You will. Now let's get some sleep.

35:39.406 --> 35:41.238
Thanks, guys.

35:41.308 --> 35:43.903
- Night, Deep.
- Night, Maura. Night, Alice.

35:43.978 --> 35:46.914
- Night, Deep. Night, Maura.
- Night.

35:49.750 --> 35:51.446
Friends.

36:01.962 --> 36:03.396
- Maura!
- Huh?

36:03.464 --> 36:05.763
- Maura!
- Let us out!

36:05.833 --> 36:07.597
- Where?
- Here!

36:07.668 --> 36:09.068
You ate us!

36:10.771 --> 36:12.137
Hi, guys, is it morning?

36:14.174 --> 36:16.609
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

36:16.677 --> 36:19.579
I knew it. Deep, this is your fault.

36:19.647 --> 36:21.411
My fault? How is it...

36:22.950 --> 36:24.248
- Ow, ow.
- I got this.

36:24.318 --> 36:26.753
Out, out.

36:26.820 --> 36:28.721
Look, let's give her
the benefit of the doubt.

36:28.789 --> 36:31.884
Until she actually digests
and eliminates us, she...

36:31.959 --> 36:34.224
- Gross!
- Okay, this usually works.

36:34.295 --> 36:36.787
- Relax me.
- Relax you?

36:36.864 --> 36:38.799
I'm the one about to be
shot through your butt.

36:38.866 --> 36:41.461
Evo, quiet. Maura, what can we do?

36:41.535 --> 36:43.504
I like my tummy rubbed.

36:43.570 --> 36:45.368
Stop, stop! That tickles.

36:45.439 --> 36:46.702
That tickles!

36:46.774 --> 36:47.867
Higher!

36:47.941 --> 36:50.376
Lower! Lower!

36:50.444 --> 36:51.935
Sorry.

36:52.012 --> 36:54.481
Try singing. Something nice.

36:54.548 --> 36:56.710
- I can sing.
- Oh, joy.

36:56.784 --> 36:58.685
<i>Deep's an octopus</i>

36:58.752 --> 37:00.948
<i>Who doesn't listen to the other fishes</i>

37:01.021 --> 37:03.252
<i>And gets his friends eaten</i>

37:03.324 --> 37:05.418
<i>Against their explicit wishes</i>

37:07.861 --> 37:10.160
- Yuck.
- Oh, gross.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.994
That was close.

37:12.066 --> 37:14.160
Well, I feel better.

37:14.234 --> 37:17.898
- I don't.
- I got this. Push.

37:17.971 --> 37:18.995
Breathe.

37:21.008 --> 37:22.442
Breathe!

37:22.509 --> 37:23.943
- Push!
- You can do it, Maura.

37:24.011 --> 37:26.344
- Come on!
- Just push!

37:31.552 --> 37:33.350
Congratulations, Maura.

37:34.621 --> 37:35.850
I'm so proud.

37:35.923 --> 37:37.414
And you are so not nursing.

37:37.491 --> 37:40.325
How dare you blame the victim. Savage.

37:40.394 --> 37:43.057
All right, then. We're all still here.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.531
It was all just a big misunderstanding.

37:45.599 --> 37:47.830
Let's chalk it up to experience, okay?

37:52.039 --> 37:53.166
What's that smell?

37:53.240 --> 37:55.505
Hey, what are you looking at me for?

37:55.576 --> 37:56.566
Ouch.

37:56.643 --> 37:58.669
I think we're getting close to
that thing Norma told us about.

37:58.746 --> 38:00.715
The entertainment business?

38:00.781 --> 38:02.647
No, the Long Island,

38:02.716 --> 38:04.810
which puts us right near the City of Men.

38:08.922 --> 38:11.858
Wow, they really wrecked this place.

38:11.925 --> 38:14.986
So if Nathan's here,
we should be able to find him.

38:15.062 --> 38:17.031
Not a lot of places a whale can hide.

38:17.097 --> 38:19.896
I hope so. He's all we got.

38:22.136 --> 38:24.298
Evo, will you quit banging into me.

38:24.371 --> 38:26.863
- Let me swim in the back.
- Forget it, sister.

38:26.940 --> 38:29.341
Not after your little
midnight munchie attack.

38:29.410 --> 38:32.073
Your breath will be giving me
nightmares for years.

38:32.146 --> 38:33.739
I have a medical condition.

38:33.814 --> 38:36.249
Homicidal is a medical condition?

38:39.119 --> 38:41.145
Wait. Slow down.

38:42.623 --> 38:45.252
Guys? Guys!

38:47.561 --> 38:49.621
Wow, look at that!

38:49.696 --> 38:51.824
The bridge Norma was talking about.

38:51.899 --> 38:53.390
We must be close!

38:58.839 --> 39:02.105
Wow, amazing. Now I've seen it all.

39:02.176 --> 39:04.304
I'm completely speechless.

39:04.378 --> 39:06.938
I take it back. Now I've seen it all.

39:07.948 --> 39:09.974
Evo, shine your light up there.

39:10.050 --> 39:12.485
Evo? Where's Evo?

39:12.553 --> 39:13.816
You didn't?

39:13.887 --> 39:18.621
No! Jeez, you eat someone one time
and they never let it go.

39:18.692 --> 39:21.958
- He's right there.
- You guys don't hear that?

39:22.029 --> 39:23.361
Someone's after us.

39:24.431 --> 39:27.299
Oh, come on. Who would want to follow us?

39:27.367 --> 39:28.835
I know neighborhoods like this.

39:28.902 --> 39:31.667
You've got to tuck in your scales
and keep your eyes on your tail.

39:31.738 --> 39:34.936
- How is that possible?
- Seriously, watch yourselves.

39:35.008 --> 39:37.136
All this stuff is just slowing us down.

39:37.211 --> 39:40.113
- We keep going.
- Sorry for chit-chatting.

39:40.180 --> 39:41.443
You know best.

39:42.683 --> 39:44.879
Clicking. Clicking.

39:44.952 --> 39:46.284
Everywhere, clicking!

39:49.556 --> 39:50.717
Now I'm clicking.

39:51.959 --> 39:53.450
Guys, focus.

39:53.527 --> 39:57.089
We just need to get past the bridge
and then we'll be in the City of Men...

40:13.113 --> 40:14.945
Giant crabs!

40:17.985 --> 40:20.648
And where do you think you're going? Hmm?

40:20.721 --> 40:26.183
We don't want any trouble,
Mr. Extremely-Big-Crab, sir.

40:26.260 --> 40:28.991
We were just heading to
the other side of the bridge.

40:29.062 --> 40:30.894
Rico does not think so.

40:32.132 --> 40:35.261
We meant the other, <i>other</i> side of the bridge.

40:35.335 --> 40:37.463
Oh, we're here. Bye!

40:40.240 --> 40:41.868
Rico kills you now.

40:41.942 --> 40:44.878
Though, uh, it's a shame you won't hear

40:44.945 --> 40:48.347
our exciting, scandalous,
death-defying story.

40:48.415 --> 40:50.543
Oh, exciting story?

40:50.617 --> 40:53.246
Um, yeah, that Alice tells really well.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.653
Um, yeah, it's-it's-it's about Evo.

40:55.722 --> 40:58.214
And it's really great
told in the first person.

40:58.292 --> 40:59.282
By Maura.

40:59.359 --> 41:01.851
Enough. Entertain me or you all ceviche.

41:01.929 --> 41:03.727
- Understand?
- Ceviche?

41:03.797 --> 41:06.460
You're marinated in lime juice
with diced peppers and tomatoes.

41:06.533 --> 41:07.762
Happened to my cousin's family.

41:07.834 --> 41:11.100
Horrible. Yet, oddly appetizing.

41:11.171 --> 41:13.731
Rico is waiting.

41:13.807 --> 41:18.108
Okay, so a sponge, a scallop,
and a rabbi walk into a bar.

41:18.178 --> 41:19.669
No, no, no! That makes no sense.

41:19.746 --> 41:21.738
- Sponges can't walk.
- It's a joke.

41:21.815 --> 41:23.374
It's not possible.

41:23.450 --> 41:25.544
A joke doesn't have to be possible.

41:25.619 --> 41:28.054
And why is a shellfish eating a rabbi?

41:28.121 --> 41:31.489
He's not eating him.
He's getting a drink with him.

41:31.558 --> 41:35.222
- Again, impossible.
- Fine. Okay.

41:35.295 --> 41:39.323
- Two blowfish are the movies...
- Enough jokes. Rico says, dance.

41:42.803 --> 41:46.570
- Deep, put me in, I got this.
- Alice, stop.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.769
- I said dance.
- D-dance?

41:49.843 --> 41:50.970
- Deep!
- You mean like...

41:51.044 --> 41:53.138
You have seven legs, use them.

41:53.213 --> 41:54.738
- Eight.
- Not for long.

41:54.815 --> 41:55.805
- Deep!
- Do it!

41:55.882 --> 41:57.350
Oh, boy.

41:57.417 --> 42:00.080
- Everybody, hang on!
- Hmm?

42:01.321 --> 42:04.951
Hit it, boys. Key of deep C.

42:12.866 --> 42:16.633
<i>When I was just a tiny thing</i>

42:16.703 --> 42:18.262
Do you mean today?

42:18.338 --> 42:21.775
<i>I told my mama, I wanna sing</i>

42:21.842 --> 42:25.335
<i>She answered me with a kick in the pants</i>

42:25.412 --> 42:30.544
<i>And said, Little prawn, you got to</i>

42:30.617 --> 42:34.520
<i>Dance</i>

42:34.588 --> 42:37.922
<i>Dance</i>

42:37.991 --> 42:39.482
<i>You trampy little scampi</i>

42:39.559 --> 42:41.460
<i>You dance worse than my Aunt Bea</i>

42:45.065 --> 42:47.591
<i>Your thighs are flabby, crabby</i>

42:47.668 --> 42:49.398
<i>Like some diseased old tabby</i>

42:50.871 --> 42:52.772
<i>Disgusting</i>

42:52.839 --> 42:55.070
<i>Your moves are cramped and campy</i>

42:55.142 --> 42:56.872
<i>A Broadway star you can't be</i>

42:56.943 --> 42:58.605
<i>You've got the gift of gabby</i>

42:58.679 --> 43:00.910
<i>I'm gonna call a cabby</i>

43:00.981 --> 43:02.449
Calling it, here I go.

43:02.516 --> 43:03.814
<i>Come on be selfish</i>

43:03.884 --> 43:05.750
<i>Shake it little shellfish</i>

43:05.819 --> 43:08.755
<i>Shake what's in the shell</i>

43:08.822 --> 43:09.846
Shake it, baby!

43:09.923 --> 43:11.186
<i>Come on be selfish</i>

43:11.258 --> 43:13.557
<i>Shake it little shellfish</i>

43:13.627 --> 43:16.426
<i>Shake what's in the shell</i>

43:16.496 --> 43:19.955
<i>Your crab legs are imitation</i>

43:20.033 --> 43:23.697
<i>You crusty old crustacean</i>

43:25.839 --> 43:27.671
<i>Spicy like good cocktail sauce</i>

43:27.741 --> 43:29.869
<i>But Rico shows you who's the boss</i>

43:37.451 --> 43:38.578
<i>Not total hooey</i>

43:38.652 --> 43:40.746
<i>My dear crab Louie</i>

43:40.821 --> 43:45.259
<i>But now your mind will go ka-blooey</i>

43:48.528 --> 43:49.621
<i>My heart you've netted</i>

43:49.696 --> 43:52.097
<i>I don't regret it</i>

43:52.165 --> 43:55.431
<i>You shake me in my shell</i>

43:55.502 --> 43:56.970
<i>You've got us reeling</i>

43:57.037 --> 43:59.632
<i>We're through the ceiling</i>

43:59.706 --> 44:03.473
<i>You shake us in our shells</i>

44:03.543 --> 44:05.102
Crab, you have been served.

44:13.053 --> 44:15.045
<i>Shrimp your steps are appetizing</i>

44:15.122 --> 44:16.988
<i>A recipe that's most surprising</i>

44:18.725 --> 44:20.455
Oh, that was nice.

44:20.527 --> 44:24.055
<i>Smooth and sweet, your moves, like butter</i>

44:24.131 --> 44:27.727
<i>You melt me, darling, like no other</i>

44:27.801 --> 44:30.965
<i>Stick with me, my little prawn</i>

44:31.037 --> 44:35.634
<i>We'll dance until the break of dawn</i>

44:35.709 --> 44:39.077
<i>My heart you've netted I don't regret it</i>

44:39.146 --> 44:42.810
<i>You shake me in my shell</i>

44:42.883 --> 44:46.411
<i>You've got us reeling
We're through the ceiling</i>

44:46.486 --> 44:50.253
<i>You shake us in our shells</i>

44:50.323 --> 44:53.951
<i>My heart you've netted, I don't regret it</i>

44:54.027 --> 44:57.623
<i>You shake me in my shell</i>

44:57.697 --> 44:58.721
<i>You've got us reeling</i>

44:58.799 --> 45:01.496
<i>We're through the ceiling</i>

45:01.568 --> 45:04.834
<i>You shake us in our shells</i>

45:04.905 --> 45:06.965
I like shaking with you.

45:12.112 --> 45:14.638
Great! Awesome! Thanks, it's been fun.

45:14.714 --> 45:15.704
Bye, all.

45:16.850 --> 45:18.944
Yeah, all right!

45:19.019 --> 45:22.478
You like me! You really like me!

45:22.556 --> 45:24.320
Alice, move it. Let's go.

45:24.391 --> 45:27.486
Go? You are not leaving Rico, <i>mi vida?</i>

45:27.561 --> 45:30.292
- Oh, but darling, I...
- You cannot.

45:30.363 --> 45:31.991
You will be Rico's wife.

45:32.065 --> 45:35.729
I would give up my shell
and one of my claws for you.

45:35.802 --> 45:40.467
I am flattered. It is nice to be
appreciated for once.

45:40.540 --> 45:41.530
Alice!

45:41.608 --> 45:43.702
You and Rico will have many children.

45:43.777 --> 45:46.372
Beautiful little half crab, half shrimps.

45:46.446 --> 45:49.575
Crimps or shrabs. <i>Ay mi madre.</i>

45:49.649 --> 45:52.517
- What dancers they will be.
- This is insanity, Claws.

45:52.586 --> 45:55.385
Alice, please. Don't leave me. You promised.

45:55.455 --> 45:57.651
Oh, I...

45:57.724 --> 46:00.091
I... I... oh.

46:00.160 --> 46:04.120
Rico, <i>gracias.</i>
I will never forget this moment.

46:05.799 --> 46:06.789
Oh.

46:08.034 --> 46:09.935
Rico hate to see you go.

46:10.937 --> 46:13.930
But he loves to watch you walk away.

46:15.242 --> 46:16.835
It is so sad to see.

46:16.910 --> 46:18.139
Don't look.

46:19.312 --> 46:20.439
Was that necessary?

46:22.115 --> 46:23.913
One last thing, my sweet!

46:23.984 --> 46:25.919
Beware of the smiley face!

46:25.986 --> 46:27.955
- Smiley face?
- Come on.

46:28.021 --> 46:30.217
The smiley face!

46:31.358 --> 46:33.224
- Amazing.
- Unbelievable.

46:33.293 --> 46:37.560
- Pure genius.
- Deep, you really think so?

46:37.631 --> 46:41.068
Oh, yeah, I mean if I hadn't
forced you out of your comfort zone,

46:41.134 --> 46:43.000
those crabs would have never let us pass.

46:43.069 --> 46:44.059
What?

46:44.137 --> 46:48.040
Sometimes you just need a visionary,
like yours truly.

46:50.710 --> 46:51.700
Wow!

46:54.080 --> 46:55.912
We made it!

46:55.982 --> 46:58.144
The City of Men.

47:00.287 --> 47:02.222
It's incredible.

47:02.289 --> 47:06.124
Yeah, incredibly empty.

47:10.697 --> 47:13.929
Why would you make all this stuff
and then destroy it?

47:14.000 --> 47:16.128
Yeah, I thought they
were supposed to be smart.

47:17.404 --> 47:19.737
Oh, maybe that's Nathan's house.

47:19.806 --> 47:22.571
- It's big enough.
- Let's check it out.

47:25.211 --> 47:28.010
- Here we go.
- Not so fast, Deep.

47:30.617 --> 47:31.778
Wait for me.

47:34.554 --> 47:35.852
Whoa!

47:35.922 --> 47:39.757
Wow, it's so amazing.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.251
Look, what's that?

47:44.931 --> 47:47.594
Deep, come here. We must be careful.

47:48.768 --> 47:51.761
Oh, seriously, I think
we should be looking for Nathan.

47:51.838 --> 47:55.468
Oh, come on, Evo. You're such a party pooper.

47:55.542 --> 47:57.033
Let's have some fun.

48:15.962 --> 48:17.191
Look, what's this?

48:18.498 --> 48:20.160
It's icky. I want one.

48:20.233 --> 48:22.031
I think it's a human being.

48:22.102 --> 48:24.571
It can't be. I thought they'd be bigger.

48:24.637 --> 48:27.539
Well, they're not so impressive after all.

48:27.607 --> 48:28.973
Let me deal with that.

48:33.947 --> 48:35.779
Weak, and it's not even tasty.

48:39.085 --> 48:41.247
Come on, let's see what we can find.

48:44.190 --> 48:47.183
Can't see a thing in here.
Evo, do your thing.

48:47.260 --> 48:48.250
Yes, Deep.

48:51.965 --> 48:53.729
Oh, no! Swim!

48:53.800 --> 48:56.565
Where to? We're surrounded.

48:56.636 --> 48:58.161
It's all your fault, snake.

48:58.238 --> 49:00.400
They'll gobble us up raw, not even grilled.

49:00.473 --> 49:02.499
Shut up, sea louse. Are they his parents?

49:02.575 --> 49:06.376
Sir, we're really sorry.
We didn't mean to eat your baby.

49:06.446 --> 49:09.177
- No, Deep, come back.
- Sir?

49:16.923 --> 49:17.913
What?

49:31.571 --> 49:32.561
Move out.

49:35.608 --> 49:37.873
Those humans really have some issues.

49:37.944 --> 49:41.437
Whoa, this place is cool.

49:41.514 --> 49:43.380
Maybe we should get moving.

49:43.450 --> 49:44.440
Huh?

49:47.454 --> 49:49.923
Don't worry, Grandpa. We will find Nathan.

49:51.891 --> 49:53.985
Everybody, let's hustle.

49:54.060 --> 49:56.052
- Huh?
- Why didn't I think of that?

49:56.129 --> 49:57.358
Oh, wait, I did.

50:02.502 --> 50:04.596
All right, Nathan, here we come.

50:05.839 --> 50:08.070
How, Deep? We're out of directions.

50:08.141 --> 50:10.770
Let's go back. Wait, we're out of directions.

50:11.911 --> 50:13.903
Okay, let me think here.

50:15.081 --> 50:16.777
Nathan!

50:17.784 --> 50:21.118
Nathan! Nathan!

50:21.187 --> 50:24.282
We followed you all the way here
and that's all you've got for a plan?

50:24.357 --> 50:26.826
Shouting, "Nathan?"

50:26.893 --> 50:28.987
Do you want me to shout "Beatrice?"

50:29.062 --> 50:31.497
I should have just stayed home and died.

50:31.564 --> 50:33.157
No one's gonna die.

50:33.233 --> 50:36.726
Listen guys, this plan may be weak,
but it's all we got.

50:36.803 --> 50:40.103
Nathan! Nathan!

50:41.107 --> 50:42.666
It's him!

50:42.742 --> 50:44.836
Wait, why would he yell his own name?

50:44.911 --> 50:47.608
Unless he's lost, too. Oh, no.

50:47.680 --> 50:50.149
I might eat you just so
I don't have to listen to you.

50:50.216 --> 50:51.479
Be cool, everybody.

50:51.551 --> 50:56.114
Nathan! Nathan!

50:56.189 --> 50:57.919
Look, that thing.

50:57.991 --> 51:00.483
I saw pictures of it
in the pile of trash at home.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.188
It goes places fast.

51:02.262 --> 51:05.357
We can go all over the city
and I bet we can find him.

51:05.431 --> 51:06.694
Come on.

51:06.766 --> 51:08.462
I wouldn't just go jumping onto...

51:08.535 --> 51:10.026
Come on, get in.

51:14.741 --> 51:16.266
Hold on tight.

51:17.277 --> 51:18.677
Let's go.

51:18.745 --> 51:19.735
Not moving.

51:21.414 --> 51:23.076
Guess it's time to start yelling "Beatrice."

51:23.149 --> 51:24.139
One second.

51:26.119 --> 51:28.281
Just need to pull that out and...

51:48.875 --> 51:50.707
And how are we going to stop?

51:54.447 --> 51:57.576
At the end of the tunnel... a light.
Wait, are we dead?

51:57.650 --> 51:59.209
Not yet, but we will be!

52:04.757 --> 52:07.693
Oh, no, we're going to crash! Jump!

52:14.033 --> 52:15.763
Guess that was the end of the line.

52:22.242 --> 52:23.676
Look there!

52:23.743 --> 52:25.177
The smiley face.

52:26.312 --> 52:27.780
- This way, guys.
- No, no, no, no, no.

52:27.847 --> 52:31.340
The crabs told us to stay away
from the smiley face.

52:31.417 --> 52:33.443
Oh, no, I don't like this.

52:42.795 --> 52:45.094
We're gonna die! We're gonna die.
We're gonna die!

52:45.164 --> 52:46.393
Run!

53:21.534 --> 53:23.901
- That was close.
- Where were you?

53:28.741 --> 53:29.970
Zombie fish.

53:32.412 --> 53:33.436
You've got to be kidding.

53:35.715 --> 53:37.911
Oh, no, we're trapped. We're gonna die.

53:43.089 --> 53:44.523
Wait, where are you going?

53:53.599 --> 53:55.534
Move it, Evo, out!

54:04.544 --> 54:07.673
We got rid of them for now.
Nathan must be behind there.

54:07.747 --> 54:11.115
What the heck are you doing?
Are you crazy, or just dumb?

54:11.184 --> 54:12.709
We almost died back there.

54:12.785 --> 54:15.016
The Kraken said to cross the City of Men.

54:15.088 --> 54:17.751
And that is exactly what I am going to do.

54:17.824 --> 54:21.261
No, Deep, Rico said stay out of here.

54:21.327 --> 54:22.488
We go back.

54:22.562 --> 54:24.360
Are you gonna listen to crabs?

54:25.365 --> 54:27.857
Or are you gonna listen to me?

55:21.654 --> 55:24.783
Guys, I don't think we're
in the City of Men anymore.

55:24.857 --> 55:26.587
What have you done with Maura?

55:26.659 --> 55:29.754
- I am Maura.
- Who are you?

55:29.829 --> 55:31.263
I'm Evo.

55:33.166 --> 55:35.397
That was a heck of a do-si-do, huh?

55:35.468 --> 55:37.801
- What?
- You do whatever you want, Deep,

55:37.870 --> 55:41.398
and expect us to come along for the ride
and we almost died because of it.

55:41.474 --> 55:44.069
But guess what? You didn't, did you?

55:44.143 --> 55:46.635
Thanks to yours truly. Ouch!

55:46.712 --> 55:49.079
Hey, what are you trying to tell me?

55:49.148 --> 55:51.413
Team, Deep. Trust the team.

55:51.484 --> 55:53.510
- I do.
- Do you?

55:53.586 --> 55:55.885
Because it seems that's
not really your thing.

55:55.955 --> 55:59.487
You just shot us halfway across the ocean,
away from Nathan, and away from the colony,

55:59.559 --> 56:01.323
and any chance of survival!

56:01.394 --> 56:02.760
Oh, give me a break.

56:02.829 --> 56:05.389
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, Deep.

56:05.465 --> 56:08.264
We may not have known
where Nathan was, but guess what?

56:08.334 --> 56:10.599
Now we don't even know where the colony is.

56:10.670 --> 56:11.763
And it's all your fault!

56:16.008 --> 56:18.375
Please, help me out here, Maura.

56:18.444 --> 56:20.413
Alice is blaming me for everything.

56:20.480 --> 56:22.005
That's just so wrong.

56:22.081 --> 56:24.710
I'll tell you what's so wrong, little guy.

56:24.784 --> 56:27.744
Me talking about eating Evo when I should
have eaten you from the beginning.

56:27.820 --> 56:28.810
Huh?

56:28.888 --> 56:30.948
Appreciate you fighting that urge, Maura.

56:31.023 --> 56:34.150
I thought we were gonna be friends, Deep,
but friends decide things together.

56:34.227 --> 56:36.025
Hey, if this is about what happened back

56:36.095 --> 56:38.963
with the zombie fish,
I had a gut feeling and I went for it.

56:39.031 --> 56:40.431
You can't blame me for that.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.402
If I went for it every time
I had a gut feeling, Deep,

56:43.469 --> 56:46.029
you'd be working your way
through my colon right now.

56:46.105 --> 56:49.473
- Maura, I...
- We are through.

56:57.917 --> 56:58.976
Wow!

57:06.559 --> 57:10.860
- Greetings, strange creatures.
- Look who's talking.

57:10.930 --> 57:13.365
I welcome you to the greatest adventure

57:13.432 --> 57:16.732
Earth has ever known: The Ark Three.

57:18.404 --> 57:20.999
The finest in colonization technology.

57:21.073 --> 57:25.477
I'm Commander Darcy.
Allow me to introduce my crew.

57:25.545 --> 57:30.006
Our head of security, the amazing Luigi.

57:30.082 --> 57:33.917
And our brilliant chief science officer,
Professor Ralph.

57:33.986 --> 57:35.352
- Hi!
- Hi.

57:35.421 --> 57:36.684
- Hi.
- Hi.

57:36.756 --> 57:38.054
- Hi!
- Hi.

57:38.124 --> 57:39.353
Knock it off.

57:39.425 --> 57:41.155
You got a hole in your head?

57:41.227 --> 57:42.752
Oh, you got to go there.

57:42.828 --> 57:45.354
As you can see, these skilled technicians

57:45.431 --> 57:47.195
are at the top of their game.

57:47.266 --> 57:49.360
Oh, there's games?

57:49.435 --> 57:53.805
- Are you guys... humans?
- Oh, no, not yet.

57:53.873 --> 57:56.502
But we will be. We will be.

57:58.144 --> 57:59.134
Huh?

57:59.211 --> 58:03.444
Oh, sorry, I get a bit tap-happy
when I'm formulating an evil plan.

58:03.516 --> 58:07.453
I mean a dirty scheme.
No! A pleasant greeting.

58:07.520 --> 58:10.046
That's it. Now, how can I help you?

58:10.122 --> 58:12.887
You wouldn't happen to know
a whale named Nathan, would you?

58:12.959 --> 58:14.985
Nathan? Hey, they're looking for Nathan.

58:15.061 --> 58:18.088
- Yeah, we do know...
- <i>Not</i> know of any such creature at all.

58:18.164 --> 58:19.996
So sorry, mates.

58:20.066 --> 58:23.867
But wait, it occurs to me,
we may have a way of tracking

58:23.936 --> 58:26.531
this Nathan fellow on board our ship.

58:26.606 --> 58:28.666
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

58:28.741 --> 58:31.472
Why don't you all come aboard
and we'll see what we can do.

58:31.544 --> 58:33.740
We have a state-of-the-art sonar system.

58:33.813 --> 58:38.217
- Great, I'm starving.
- Yes, well. Follow me.

58:38.284 --> 58:39.946
We'll take care of you on the ship.

58:40.019 --> 58:42.921
We'll take good care of you.

58:51.097 --> 58:53.498
Why did you deceive them, boss?

58:53.566 --> 58:55.558
Shh, I'll explain.

58:55.635 --> 58:57.604
Ralph, give the folks the tour.

58:57.670 --> 58:58.831
Oh, goodie!

59:01.841 --> 59:04.709
These are the walls. We got a ton of these.

59:04.777 --> 59:07.372
Oh, and here's where we
can have protein pellets.

59:13.686 --> 59:14.984
So bland.

59:20.526 --> 59:22.722
- But what's your mission?
- You'll see.

59:26.899 --> 59:28.128
Whoa!

59:37.410 --> 59:38.878
<i>Welcome to the Ark Three.</i>

59:38.944 --> 59:40.708
<i>I'm Dr. Marvin Laird.</i>

59:40.780 --> 59:43.807
<i>Let me tell you about this exciting mission.</i>

59:43.883 --> 59:46.375
<i>Scientists have found a distant planet</i>

59:46.452 --> 59:50.389
<i>with all the air and water
we need to sustain Earth's life.</i>

59:50.456 --> 59:54.857
<i>All remaining humans have already
headed there on a ship we call Ark One.</i>

59:55.961 --> 59:58.624
<i>Following close behind is Ark Two,</i>

59:58.698 --> 01:00:02.658
<i>containing... you guessed it...
Earth's land creatures.</i>

01:00:02.735 --> 01:00:05.330
<i>Then, last to launch will be Ark Three,</i>

01:00:05.404 --> 01:00:08.932
<i>to be filled with as many
marine species as we can collect.</i>

01:00:09.008 --> 01:00:11.637
<i>These fish are being gathered by three</i>

01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:14.112
<i>of the Earth's
most intelligent sea creatures,</i>

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.912
<i>rescued from the finest zoos
and carnivals on the planet.</i>

01:00:17.983 --> 01:00:20.475
<i>Now, transporting so much marine life</i>

01:00:20.553 --> 01:00:22.920
<i>presents its challenges, which we've overcome</i>

01:00:22.988 --> 01:00:26.789
<i>through the miracle of flash freezing.</i>

01:00:26.859 --> 01:00:28.088
Ouch.

01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:32.897
I don't get it, boss.

01:00:32.965 --> 01:00:35.298
We are loaded to the ceiling already.

01:00:35.367 --> 01:00:38.269
Why are you doing back flips over these guys?

01:00:38.337 --> 01:00:41.739
Luigi my lad, you're as smart
as you are handsome.

01:00:41.807 --> 01:00:45.244
This is a case of quantityversus quality.

01:00:51.917 --> 01:00:53.442
Let me lay it out for you.

01:00:54.587 --> 01:00:56.283
<i>We've got pike from Pawtucket</i>

01:00:56.355 --> 01:00:58.017
<i>We've bream by the bucket</i>

01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:01.060
<i>We've sockeyes and sacks full of squid</i>

01:01:01.127 --> 01:01:02.823
<i>There are crates of anchovies</i>

01:01:02.895 --> 01:01:04.227
<i>And French abalones</i>

01:01:04.296 --> 01:01:06.856
<i>And a Norwegian narwhal named Sid</i>

01:01:06.932 --> 01:01:10.767
Hi, Sid. <i>But the ones that just came</i>

01:01:10.836 --> 01:01:14.295
<i>They will change the whole game</i>

01:01:14.373 --> 01:01:17.741
<i>When we show up with these prizes</i>

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:22.874
<i>They will be singing our names</i>

01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:27.019
<i>Throw them back in the pail</i>

01:01:27.086 --> 01:01:30.147
<i>Every stingray and snail</i>

01:01:30.222 --> 01:01:31.588
<i>The fish that we found</i>

01:01:31.657 --> 01:01:33.250
<i>The fish that we found</i>

01:01:33.325 --> 01:01:36.591
<i>Are just on a whole 'nother scale</i>

01:01:36.662 --> 01:01:39.860
<i>Throw them back in the pail</i>

01:01:39.932 --> 01:01:42.800
<i>Every stingray and snail</i>

01:01:42.868 --> 01:01:44.530
<i>The fish that we found</i>

01:01:44.603 --> 01:01:46.071
<i>The fish that we found</i>

01:01:46.138 --> 01:01:49.336
<i>Are just on a whole 'nother scale</i>

01:01:49.408 --> 01:01:50.671
<i>These treasures aquatic</i>

01:01:50.743 --> 01:01:52.336
<i>Exotic, hypnotic</i>

01:01:52.411 --> 01:01:55.472
<i>Oh, man, this plan can never fail</i>

01:01:55.548 --> 01:01:57.278
<i>The humans will cheer</i>

01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:58.874
<i>On the day we premiere</i>

01:01:58.951 --> 01:02:02.183
<i>These treasures we bring them on ice</i>

01:02:05.157 --> 01:02:08.358
<i>Then we'll call all the shots
Do you think we'll get knots?</i>

01:02:08.427 --> 01:02:11.829
<i>Mark my words we can name any price</i>

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.536
<i>A house with a 12-car garage</i>

01:02:17.603 --> 01:02:20.801
<i>Manicures and massage</i>

01:02:20.873 --> 01:02:24.071
<i>We won't fit in our seats just because</i>

01:02:24.143 --> 01:02:27.238
<i>We will be living so large</i>

01:02:27.313 --> 01:02:31.045
- Our faces on money.
- Boiled eggs that aren't runny?

01:02:31.116 --> 01:02:34.518
Bigger, think bigger, Luigi.
Large as a barge.

01:02:34.587 --> 01:02:37.147
- What's as large as a barge?
- A promotion.

01:02:37.223 --> 01:02:41.923
- To general? To doorman?
- Better, Luigi. To human!

01:02:41.994 --> 01:02:46.364
Jolly good. Oh, wait. What are you saying?

01:02:46.432 --> 01:02:49.561
<i>The humans will give us a chance</i>

01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:52.696
<i>To play at football or dance</i>

01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:54.433
<i>With new human parts</i>

01:02:54.506 --> 01:02:56.168
<i>New brains and new hearts</i>

01:02:56.242 --> 01:02:59.212
<i>And possibly even some pants</i>

01:02:59.278 --> 01:03:01.941
- Pants?
- Pants.

01:03:02.014 --> 01:03:03.846
I don't see why not.

01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:07.250
<i>We'll be members of that species</i>

01:03:07.319 --> 01:03:08.617
<i>Most advanced</i>

01:03:08.687 --> 01:03:10.849
<i>Most advanced</i>

01:03:10.923 --> 01:03:15.361
- <i>With their biotech
- And their nanotech</i>

01:03:16.362 --> 01:03:21.767
<i>And their pants</i>

01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:34.040
<i>And there you have it.
The mission in a nutshell.</i>

01:03:34.113 --> 01:03:36.446
<i>So when's the big blast off?</i>

01:03:36.515 --> 01:03:38.677
<i>Just check that countdown clock
on the screen.</i>

01:03:38.751 --> 01:03:41.243
<i>One hour to lift off.</i>

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.449
But supposing they escape before we lift off?

01:03:44.523 --> 01:03:46.321
You leave that to me.

01:03:47.559 --> 01:03:50.757
<i>So long for now.
We'll see you on the new Earth.</i>

01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:52.923
<i>I'm 47% sure of it.</i>

01:03:52.998 --> 01:03:55.729
Yes, and today's the big day.

01:03:55.801 --> 01:03:57.963
Off we go into space together.

01:03:58.971 --> 01:04:00.564
Maybe we should go with them.

01:04:00.639 --> 01:04:03.108
Look at all those lights up there.

01:04:03.175 --> 01:04:06.145
It's a whole sky full of lanternfish.

01:04:06.211 --> 01:04:09.079
Guys, hello, we're not going anywhere.

01:04:09.148 --> 01:04:12.118
We have to save the colony.
And that means finding Nathan.

01:04:12.184 --> 01:04:14.949
Of course, young man. I admire your focus.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:19.014
Luigi take our guests
to the sonar room right away.

01:04:19.091 --> 01:04:21.651
- You've got it, boss.
- Thanks.

01:04:23.896 --> 01:04:26.832
Maura, dear, why aren't you
with your friends?

01:04:26.899 --> 01:04:28.595
I don't think they're my friends anymore.

01:04:28.667 --> 01:04:29.726
At least Deep isn't.

01:04:29.802 --> 01:04:32.966
Ah well, he seems like a nice enough fellow.

01:04:33.038 --> 01:04:35.439
That's what I thought, but friends
should look out for each other.

01:04:35.507 --> 01:04:39.137
Ah! So that's why he was saying
all those things about you.

01:04:39.211 --> 01:04:42.511
- What? What did he say?
- Oh, nothing. I'm sorry.

01:04:42.581 --> 01:04:45.380
- It's none of my business.
- Tell me. Tell me what he said.

01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:48.216
All I can say is,
I don't think you're as dumb

01:04:48.287 --> 01:04:50.813
- as a bag of dead kelp.
- He said that?!

01:04:50.889 --> 01:04:54.223
And I certainly don't think you're
as ugly as a blobfish's bottom.

01:04:54.293 --> 01:04:56.990
I am going to eat him alive!

01:04:57.062 --> 01:04:58.189
Calm down, dear.

01:04:58.263 --> 01:05:00.129
If there's one thing the humans taught us,

01:05:00.199 --> 01:05:03.192
- it's respect your team members.
- Hey, Darcy?

01:05:03.268 --> 01:05:05.567
- I was thinking...
- Say another word and I...

01:05:07.106 --> 01:05:09.974
- Give you a treat.
- Ooh, oh, boy, oh, boy.

01:05:10.042 --> 01:05:12.273
- What if I say two words?
- Two treats.

01:05:12.344 --> 01:05:14.745
But only if you say them
to that doorknob over there.

01:05:15.748 --> 01:05:17.341
Double yay!

01:05:17.416 --> 01:05:18.611
Not a super genius, is he?

01:05:18.684 --> 01:05:20.812
Basically a bowling ball with a tail.

01:05:20.886 --> 01:05:25.824
Maura, we're about to join the humans
in a new world, as equals.

01:05:25.891 --> 01:05:26.984
You can, too.

01:05:27.059 --> 01:05:30.393
Why aren't you telling Deep this?
He's our leader.

01:05:30.462 --> 01:05:32.556
My dear, the Earth is dying.

01:05:32.631 --> 01:05:35.601
Maybe you're mad at them,
but don't you want to save their lives?

01:05:35.667 --> 01:05:37.602
Isn't that what being a true friend is?

01:05:37.669 --> 01:05:39.535
But how can I help when
he won't listen to me?

01:05:39.605 --> 01:05:41.540
I'm glad you asked.

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:48.009
I got a strange feeling about these guys.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.050
- Stay close.
- Whatever, Deep.

01:05:51.116 --> 01:05:53.950
Here we are. The sonar room.

01:05:54.019 --> 01:05:57.319
- This is the sonar room?
- Of course it is.

01:05:57.389 --> 01:06:00.917
Just read the sign. See, sonar room.

01:06:04.263 --> 01:06:06.061
Please, guests first.

01:06:06.131 --> 01:06:07.224
I don't know.

01:06:07.299 --> 01:06:09.268
It looks pretty dark in there.

01:06:10.803 --> 01:06:13.705
You have a light attached
to your head, silly.

01:06:13.772 --> 01:06:16.867
Oo-wee! Look at all the sonar in here.

01:06:16.942 --> 01:06:20.276
This is biggest sonar I've ever seen.

01:06:21.647 --> 01:06:24.776
Well, okay. Let's go, guys.

01:06:26.518 --> 01:06:29.181
So, where's all this sonar?

01:06:29.254 --> 01:06:30.278
Is this it?

01:06:30.355 --> 01:06:33.018
I'm pretty sure that's a wall.

01:06:33.092 --> 01:06:37.530
So, Maura, where's the... sonar?

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:40.761
Maura, what's going on?

01:06:40.833 --> 01:06:43.234
What are you doing? Hey!

01:06:43.302 --> 01:06:46.295
Saving our lives, Deep.
That's what real friends do.

01:06:46.371 --> 01:06:49.637
You'll thank me later,
when we're on the new Earth.

01:06:49.708 --> 01:06:50.767
Hey!

01:06:53.212 --> 01:06:55.272
Shouldn't have trusted that Darcy.

01:06:55.347 --> 01:06:57.111
Could never tell if he had knees.

01:06:57.182 --> 01:07:01.244
Maura's the one who tricked us.
You're not my friend anymore!

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.415
Friends don't eat and then
throw up their friends.

01:07:05.424 --> 01:07:07.393
Yeah, it's all Maura's fault.

01:07:07.459 --> 01:07:09.655
It's time for me to really take charge.

01:07:09.728 --> 01:07:11.287
- Ha, are you serious?
- Shh!

01:07:11.363 --> 01:07:13.662
I'm waiting for inspiration to hit.

01:07:13.732 --> 01:07:15.223
Ouch, hey!

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.326
That inspirational enough for you?

01:07:17.402 --> 01:07:20.600
Ever stop to think that maybe
the whole reason Maura betrayed us

01:07:20.672 --> 01:07:22.436
is because you ignored her?

01:07:22.508 --> 01:07:24.773
- You're crazy.
- Am I, Deep?

01:07:24.843 --> 01:07:27.369
Am I crazy for thinking
we're all in this together?

01:07:27.446 --> 01:07:29.574
- Uh-oh.
- For thinking that maybe if you trust us

01:07:29.648 --> 01:07:32.641
there might be some slim chance
we could actually find Nathan!

01:07:32.718 --> 01:07:34.516
Excuse me.

01:07:38.056 --> 01:07:40.150
Hey, wait! Why are we all screaming?

01:07:40.225 --> 01:07:42.660
Are... are you Nathan?

01:07:42.728 --> 01:07:46.028
Oh, well yes, I suppose I am.

01:07:47.032 --> 01:07:49.900
Nathan! Yeah! Yeah!

01:07:49.968 --> 01:07:52.062
Nathan, you gotta come back with us.

01:07:52.137 --> 01:07:53.696
I'm sorry, little one.

01:07:53.772 --> 01:07:56.503
But I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

01:07:56.575 --> 01:07:59.044
Can't you break out? You're huge.

01:07:59.111 --> 01:08:04.015
What for? In my day,
the ocean was teeming with life.

01:08:04.082 --> 01:08:09.350
But now it's a vast pit of broken dreams
and all my friends are dead.

01:08:09.421 --> 01:08:11.447
Boy, this guy's a bucket of cheer.

01:08:11.523 --> 01:08:12.513
And that's me talking.

01:08:12.591 --> 01:08:14.787
Nathan, sir, I just...

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.328
Hi, Nathan, I'm Deep and I'm in charge here.

01:08:17.395 --> 01:08:18.830
Back off, Deep.

01:08:18.897 --> 01:08:21.059
Haven't you done enough harm?

01:08:21.133 --> 01:08:22.897
- But, I...
- I'm warning you.

01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:25.335
One, two, three!

01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:26.531
<i>Begin launch sequence.</i>

01:08:27.673 --> 01:08:28.800
What did I do?

01:08:28.874 --> 01:08:31.399
I don't know, but it looks like
this ship is turning on.

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:32.671
<i>Initiate sequence.</i>

01:08:33.879 --> 01:08:34.938
<i>Thirty minutes 'til launch.</i>

01:08:35.013 --> 01:08:38.040
- Somebody do something!
- It's no use.

01:08:38.116 --> 01:08:39.913
- Yes it is.
- Huh?

01:08:39.984 --> 01:08:41.680
You said all your friends were dead.

01:08:41.752 --> 01:08:44.814
- Well, what about the Kraken?
- The Kraken? He's alive?

01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:47.086
Yeah. He's the one who sent us to find you.

01:08:47.158 --> 01:08:50.459
He's trapped now, with his whole colony,
worse than you are.

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:53.124
The Kraken has saved my life countless times.

01:08:53.198 --> 01:08:56.532
And I his. Those were the days.

01:08:56.602 --> 01:08:59.800
Well, those days are numbered
if we can't get back and help him.

01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:01.169
It's up to you, Nathan.

01:09:03.809 --> 01:09:05.437
Stand back.

01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:09.106
Splendid!

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:11.877
A toast to our new world.

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:13.417
- Our new world!
- Our new world!

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.613
It's coming from Nathan's cage.

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.419
Whoa, wait. Nathan?

01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:22.359
<i>Attention! Breach attempted in chamber 55.</i>

01:09:22.426 --> 01:09:25.453
Chum buckets! That bag of blubber
is going to ruin everything.

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:28.398
Luigi, freeze the entire chamber, stat.

01:09:28.466 --> 01:09:29.799
Yes, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

01:09:29.868 --> 01:09:31.894
You can't do that, you'll kill them.

01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:33.962
Who asked you, you overgrown worm.

01:09:34.038 --> 01:09:36.941
I... I thought we were gonna be friends.

01:09:37.009 --> 01:09:39.205
Bring it up at
the next group sharing session.

01:09:39.278 --> 01:09:41.941
- Oh, yeah! When's that boss?
- Never!

01:09:42.014 --> 01:09:43.743
- But you said I could...
- Shut up!

01:09:43.814 --> 01:09:45.841
That's what you can do, moron. Shut up!

01:09:47.486 --> 01:09:49.785
<i>Freezing unit activated.</i>

01:09:57.929 --> 01:10:00.831
I told you. I can't do it.

01:10:00.899 --> 01:10:04.301
- What's that sound?
- That freezer unit.

01:10:04.369 --> 01:10:08.204
It's extremely strong.
They've run it to punish me before.

01:10:08.273 --> 01:10:10.037
But never so high.

01:10:10.108 --> 01:10:12.100
They're trying to turn us into frozen food!

01:10:13.545 --> 01:10:16.709
Keep moving or you'll freeze solid.

01:10:16.782 --> 01:10:20.275
- Evo, Deep, think!
- Leave me alone.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.615
You're right, Alice. I've done enough damage.

01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:27.125
How many lives have I ended?

01:10:27.192 --> 01:10:29.752
Mothers. Kids.

01:10:29.828 --> 01:10:33.265
My closest friends. I'm no leader, guys.

01:10:33.332 --> 01:10:35.096
I'm a murderer.

01:10:36.368 --> 01:10:38.132
Oh, for crying out loud!

01:10:38.203 --> 01:10:40.968
Is that the best you can do,
you big, whiney cephalopod?

01:10:41.039 --> 01:10:42.735
We need you, dude, like, now.

01:10:42.808 --> 01:10:45.835
Your mad genius. Your drive. And I mean it.

01:10:45.911 --> 01:10:48.881
So get off that sorry little butt of yours
and lead us, leader.

01:10:48.947 --> 01:10:49.971
That's an order!

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:53.785
Okay, let me think here.

01:10:56.221 --> 01:10:57.484
Got it.

01:10:57.556 --> 01:10:59.252
Sorry, just me.

01:11:00.492 --> 01:11:02.984
Okay, guys, who has an idea?

01:11:03.061 --> 01:11:04.689
- Throw them out.
- Really?

01:11:04.763 --> 01:11:08.063
Really. I want to hear your ideas, and fast.

01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:10.659
Well, I know that whenever
I get too worked up,

01:11:10.736 --> 01:11:12.830
my light goes on the fritz.

01:11:12.904 --> 01:11:14.930
Evo, you're brilliant.

01:11:15.006 --> 01:11:16.338
- I am?
- Yes.

01:11:16.408 --> 01:11:18.809
We don't try to turn the freezer unit down.

01:11:18.877 --> 01:11:20.846
We turn it all the way up.

01:11:20.912 --> 01:11:23.404
Push it so far it blows out.

01:11:23.482 --> 01:11:24.472
Let's go.

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.047
How are we going to open that panel?

01:11:32.124 --> 01:11:34.684
- I have an idea.
- I'm listening.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.628
I'm probably small enough to get
into that panel and open it.

01:11:37.696 --> 01:11:39.722
And Evo's electrified.

01:11:39.798 --> 01:11:42.859
He's got to be able to jam
the electric controls somehow.

01:11:42.934 --> 01:11:45.961
But it's too small, even for you, Alice.

01:11:46.037 --> 01:11:49.098
I got this, boys. Shut your eyes.

01:11:49.174 --> 01:11:51.268
Put out a tentacle and hold this for me.

01:11:52.944 --> 01:11:55.641
- What is this?
- Keep 'em closed.

01:11:55.714 --> 01:11:57.080
Now just...

01:11:58.784 --> 01:12:00.980
And there. Okay, you can look.

01:12:05.257 --> 01:12:06.782
Thanks, I'll take that.

01:12:06.858 --> 01:12:07.985
She opened it.

01:12:09.227 --> 01:12:10.752
Great work, Alice.

01:12:10.829 --> 01:12:13.060
Oh... and never do that again.

01:12:14.299 --> 01:12:16.165
Evo, it's all you.

01:12:16.234 --> 01:12:18.533
You're the only one who
can handle electricity.

01:12:20.305 --> 01:12:22.001
We need you, buddy.

01:12:22.073 --> 01:12:24.633
Figure out how to turn
that thing up to the max.

01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:29.044
- And hurry.
- You got it, captain.

01:12:29.114 --> 01:12:31.447
Come on, you can do it, my friend.

01:12:32.484 --> 01:12:34.578
Okay, no fear now.

01:12:34.653 --> 01:12:36.451
Ouch! Oh, ouch!

01:12:40.926 --> 01:12:42.019
Here we go.

01:12:43.395 --> 01:12:47.457
Okay, there's a red wire and a green wire.

01:12:47.532 --> 01:12:48.522
Which one do I cut?

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.590
- Red!
- Green!

01:12:49.668 --> 01:12:50.658
- Green.
- Red.

01:12:50.735 --> 01:12:51.725
- Red.
- Green.

01:12:51.803 --> 01:12:52.827
Green and red it is.

01:12:58.910 --> 01:13:00.708
Are you okay, Evo?

01:13:02.414 --> 01:13:03.882
It's electric!

01:13:03.949 --> 01:13:05.975
Boogie oogie oogie!

01:13:07.919 --> 01:13:10.150
It's never been like this before.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.184
You okay, buddy?

01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:20.232
- Never been better.
- We did it!

01:13:20.298 --> 01:13:21.527
We did it together!

01:13:23.802 --> 01:13:25.794
But we still have no way out.

01:13:26.805 --> 01:13:27.932
Hmm.

01:13:28.006 --> 01:13:31.272
So what I think we should do is...

01:13:31.343 --> 01:13:33.403
Listen to someone else with a great idea.

01:13:33.478 --> 01:13:35.379
If I can make a suggestion.

01:13:35.447 --> 01:13:37.439
- Yeah.
- Talk to the eye.

01:13:37.516 --> 01:13:39.815
Okay. Hello, Mr. Eye.

01:13:39.885 --> 01:13:43.117
- I'm Deep and...
- Not my eye, that eye.

01:13:43.188 --> 01:13:45.851
It's called a camera.
They're watching us through it.

01:13:48.393 --> 01:13:49.588
Hello?

01:13:49.661 --> 01:13:50.651
Maura?

01:13:51.663 --> 01:13:52.722
<i>We need your help.</i>

01:13:55.467 --> 01:13:58.198
<i>Oh, now you need my help?</i>

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.330
<i>Even though I'm dumber
than a bag of dead kelp?</i>

01:14:00.405 --> 01:14:01.703
- What?
- You didn't say that?

01:14:01.773 --> 01:14:07.178
No! Maura, the only one dumber
than a bag of dead kelp here is me.

01:14:07.245 --> 01:14:10.511
- You were right to leave us.
- Not us, you.

01:14:10.582 --> 01:14:13.211
You're the problem, Deep.

01:14:13.285 --> 01:14:16.346
You're right, Maura, but you can save us.

01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:18.447
- Hmm.
- And the colony.

01:14:18.523 --> 01:14:22.858
- I'm on all eight knees begging you.
- Why should I?

01:14:22.928 --> 01:14:26.023
Because the Kraken said
we have to trust our team.

01:14:26.097 --> 01:14:27.998
And no matter what choices you've made,

01:14:28.066 --> 01:14:30.433
<i>or I've made, we're a team.</i>

01:14:30.502 --> 01:14:33.438
<i>You'll always be part of it,
right to the end.</i>

01:14:33.505 --> 01:14:37.306
Which will be pretty soon
if you don't help us.

01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:38.968
I don't know, Deep.

01:14:43.248 --> 01:14:45.080
Well, we're gonna die.

01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:49.747
If anyone needs me, I'll be jamming
my light in random sockets.

01:14:49.821 --> 01:14:52.916
No, Evo. Look, there's always got to be...

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.223
A way.

01:14:56.294 --> 01:14:58.388
I knew she would help.

01:14:58.463 --> 01:15:00.364
- Follow me.
- Good luck, friends.

01:15:00.432 --> 01:15:03.596
And if you see that penguin,
kick him in the shins for me.

01:15:03.668 --> 01:15:06.297
Don't worry, Nathan.
We'll get you out of here.

01:15:08.673 --> 01:15:10.335
Maura, Maura.

01:15:10.475 --> 01:15:12.637
After all we've been through together.

01:15:12.711 --> 01:15:14.680
We've know each other for like 40 minutes.

01:15:14.746 --> 01:15:17.614
Good point. Then I won't feel
so bad when I eliminate you.

01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:19.840
Freeze, Darcy.

01:15:19.918 --> 01:15:20.942
- Deep.
- What?

01:15:24.456 --> 01:15:25.617
Thanks, Maura.

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:28.353
Okay, first of all,
you don't get to say "freeze."

01:15:28.426 --> 01:15:31.396
<i>I'm</i> the one with the freeze gun.
I say "freeze."

01:15:31.463 --> 01:15:33.932
And also, "blast off."

01:15:33.999 --> 01:15:36.264
<i>Launch sequence green initiated.</i>

01:15:36.334 --> 01:15:39.964
Luigi, Ralph, to the bridge.
We're taking off.

01:15:40.038 --> 01:15:42.701
Earth is our home, you foot-flapping lowlife.

01:15:42.774 --> 01:15:44.106
And we're not leaving it.

01:15:47.012 --> 01:15:48.105
Forget it!

01:15:48.179 --> 01:15:49.807
Oh, no.

01:15:49.881 --> 01:15:52.180
No!

01:15:56.187 --> 01:15:58.053
- Huh?
- Evo!

01:15:58.123 --> 01:16:00.490
<i>Impossible to disarm countdown.</i>

01:16:00.558 --> 01:16:02.117
<i>Takeoff in two minutes.</i>

01:16:02.193 --> 01:16:03.491
- <i>Stage two initiated.</i>
- Come one, come on, come on.

01:16:03.561 --> 01:16:06.360
- Lost your chance, mate.
- Leave my friend alone.

01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:08.332
What now?

01:16:09.501 --> 01:16:10.560
Teamwork, guys.

01:16:11.569 --> 01:16:12.559
What the?

01:16:16.474 --> 01:16:18.067
- Hey, Darcy.
- Hmm?

01:16:18.143 --> 01:16:19.338
Freeze.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.078
- Good shot!
- Yay!

01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:26.982
Enough playing games.

01:16:33.758 --> 01:16:37.320
- Put your gun down.
- You put your gun down.

01:16:37.395 --> 01:16:40.661
- No, you put your gun down.
- You both put your guns down.

01:16:40.732 --> 01:16:42.394
Alice, you don't even have a gun.

01:16:42.467 --> 01:16:44.197
This game is fun!

01:16:44.269 --> 01:16:45.862
Somebody tell me to put my gun down.

01:16:45.937 --> 01:16:47.405
- Hey, Ralph?
- Huh?

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:49.441
- Sorry.
- Huh?

01:16:49.507 --> 01:16:52.170
Got a lot of empty space up here.

01:16:52.243 --> 01:16:54.109
- What?
- What is that?

01:16:54.179 --> 01:16:55.909
Oh, that tickles. That tickles.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.107
Come and get me, whiskers.

01:16:57.182 --> 01:16:58.673
Get out of there, you chicken!

01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:59.809
I'm a shrimp.

01:17:05.056 --> 01:17:06.046
Good work, Alice.

01:17:07.125 --> 01:17:08.115
Oh, no.

01:17:10.028 --> 01:17:11.496
Stupid human machine.

01:17:14.599 --> 01:17:17.763
Maura, anything there
that could contain a walrus?

01:17:17.836 --> 01:17:20.101
Nothing can contain a walrus.

01:17:20.171 --> 01:17:22.197
- Maura?
- I'm looking.

01:17:25.009 --> 01:17:26.568
What?

01:17:26.644 --> 01:17:28.306
No! Maura!

01:17:29.347 --> 01:17:30.337
Huh?

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:33.440
Oh, no!

01:17:49.601 --> 01:17:51.832
<i>Ejecting hibernation pod.</i>

01:17:51.903 --> 01:17:53.428
Oh, except this.

01:17:53.505 --> 01:17:55.667
This can definitely contain a walrus.

01:18:05.216 --> 01:18:06.309
Evo.

01:18:10.054 --> 01:18:14.958
- I'm so sorry, Evo.
- Oh, Deep, get up.

01:18:15.026 --> 01:18:17.655
No, I want to stay with him.

01:18:17.729 --> 01:18:19.527
We can mourn later.

01:18:19.597 --> 01:18:23.090
We have to free Nathan
and save the colony, now.

01:18:25.036 --> 01:18:27.437
<i>Launch stage orange, initiated.</i>

01:18:27.505 --> 01:18:29.633
<i>Countdown to ignition has begun.</i>

01:18:29.707 --> 01:18:31.437
Maura, what are we going to do?

01:18:31.509 --> 01:18:32.772
Why are you asking me?

01:18:32.844 --> 01:18:34.745
You've been listening to this stuff all day.

01:18:34.813 --> 01:18:36.304
Some of it must have rubbed off on you.

01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:38.407
It might as well be Swahili.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.544
<i>System error.</i>

01:18:43.621 --> 01:18:46.352
- Nothing's working!
- <i>Stage red.</i>

01:18:46.424 --> 01:18:48.916
<i>Two, one, lift off.</i>

01:19:10.081 --> 01:19:13.313
Hoof it, Alice. Show us what you got.

01:19:13.384 --> 01:19:15.478
I really should do a little stretching first.

01:19:15.553 --> 01:19:18.216
- Dance!
- Okay, here we go.

01:19:19.424 --> 01:19:20.585
Come on, Alice!

01:19:20.658 --> 01:19:22.217
Okay, that didn't work.

01:19:41.579 --> 01:19:43.207
Evo!

01:19:44.482 --> 01:19:46.417
Goodbye, buddy!

01:20:03.368 --> 01:20:05.530
All the creatures are being released.

01:20:08.506 --> 01:20:11.704
What about Nathan? Nathan!

01:20:30.328 --> 01:20:32.627
All the doors opened but Nathan's.

01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:34.359
We were so close.

01:20:34.432 --> 01:20:36.731
Can't believe I caused all of this.

01:20:36.801 --> 01:20:38.201
It's all my fault.

01:20:38.269 --> 01:20:40.602
It's over, Deep. Let's go.

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.720
Lose something, guys?

01:21:08.199 --> 01:21:09.497
Huh?

01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:15.871
- Hey, where am I?
- You're alive!

01:21:17.675 --> 01:21:20.509
Why do I smell like whale tongue?

01:21:22.013 --> 01:21:23.447
You had us worried there, buddy.

01:21:23.514 --> 01:21:26.780
I'm okay, though I'm not so sure about this.

01:21:30.088 --> 01:21:31.681
But we're not done yet.

01:21:31.756 --> 01:21:35.488
I have a friend to save.
Let's hope we're not too late.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.722
Now, let's move, my little friends.

01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:46.365
Uh, could you stop that?

01:21:46.437 --> 01:21:48.668
Sorry, it happens when I'm nervous.

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.971
Quiet, quiet everyone.

01:21:51.042 --> 01:21:55.504
I had hoped that Deep would have
found Nathan and saved us by now.

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:59.517
I can only say that I'm sorry.
There's nothing more we can do.

01:21:59.584 --> 01:22:01.644
It'll all be over soon.

01:22:05.757 --> 01:22:08.488
Grandfather, are you there?

01:22:08.559 --> 01:22:11.028
Deep? Deep, it that you?

01:22:12.663 --> 01:22:14.427
Not just me.

01:22:14.499 --> 01:22:16.695
- Kraken?
- Nathan.

01:22:16.768 --> 01:22:19.932
Well, that's a voice
I haven't heard in a while.

01:22:20.004 --> 01:22:22.166
- Whiney as ever.
- Oh, yeah?

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.675
Well, unless you can move these rocks,

01:22:24.742 --> 01:22:27.211
you won't be hearing it again, ya fathead.

01:22:33.284 --> 01:22:34.946
Everyone, out of my way.

01:22:37.121 --> 01:22:39.113
Come on, Nathan. You can do it.

01:22:46.064 --> 01:22:47.054
Come on!

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.602
- No, don't stop.
- It's no use.

01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:55.902
This pile won't come free unless
it's loosened from the middle.

01:22:55.973 --> 01:22:57.737
- I'm going in.
- What?

01:22:57.809 --> 01:23:00.244
You'll be crushed.
Deep, thank you for trying,

01:23:00.311 --> 01:23:02.041
but I don't want you to see this.

01:23:02.113 --> 01:23:04.412
- Please, just go.
- No way.

01:23:04.482 --> 01:23:07.077
Look, I caused all of this
and I'm gonna fix it.

01:23:07.151 --> 01:23:09.086
Deep, don't! Listen to me.

01:23:09.153 --> 01:23:11.748
Never did before, Grandpa. Why start now?

01:23:16.627 --> 01:23:17.617
Come on, team!

01:23:25.536 --> 01:23:27.129
There! This rock.

01:23:27.205 --> 01:23:29.697
We'll dislodge it and the big rock will move.

01:23:33.711 --> 01:23:35.509
Oh, no.

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.708
Nathan, we have to do this together.

01:23:37.782 --> 01:23:39.375
On three. Three!

01:23:51.529 --> 01:23:53.122
We did it! Now move.

01:23:54.165 --> 01:23:55.155
What?

01:23:59.604 --> 01:24:00.594
We made it!

01:24:01.906 --> 01:24:03.306
Quickly, everyone out.

01:24:13.017 --> 01:24:14.849
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:24:14.919 --> 01:24:16.251
- Yippee!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.552
Deep, we did it! Deep?

01:24:19.624 --> 01:24:21.820
- Oh, no!
- Deep?

01:24:22.827 --> 01:24:26.594
Oh, Deep. My little, reckless boy.

01:24:30.535 --> 01:24:31.525
Oh, no...

01:24:32.737 --> 01:24:34.171
Wait, what's that?

01:24:37.275 --> 01:24:38.903
What's everyone crying about?

01:24:44.782 --> 01:24:48.844
- You saved us.
- We saved us, together.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.445
With a little thing called teamwork.

01:24:50.521 --> 01:24:53.389
Remind me to explain it to you again.
Kidding.

01:24:55.526 --> 01:24:57.586
You're a true leader at last.

01:24:57.662 --> 01:24:59.528
It's time for you to take my place.

01:24:59.597 --> 01:25:03.557
No, we're all going to work together
and make things better.

01:25:03.634 --> 01:25:05.398
How will you all fit on the throne?

01:25:05.469 --> 01:25:07.665
We'll crowd. Alice will diet.

01:25:07.738 --> 01:25:10.503
Not your problem, Grandpa. You are fired.

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.404
See, it's not that bad down here.

01:25:14.478 --> 01:25:17.414
Believe it or not,
it's not so bad up there either.

01:25:17.481 --> 01:25:19.109
I've been out of it for a while.

01:25:19.183 --> 01:25:23.348
You know, I could use a tour guide,
you big blubber butt.

01:25:24.355 --> 01:25:25.914
Oh, my friend, you saved us.

01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:28.983
Oh please, remember the time you saved me

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:32.394
from that creature near Tokyo
that breathed atomic fire?

01:25:32.463 --> 01:25:35.900
Oh, yes, and then
the giant moth chased us off.

01:25:35.967 --> 01:25:38.368
Weird summer!

01:25:38.436 --> 01:25:41.372
How about that, buddy? You survived.

01:25:41.439 --> 01:25:45.206
Of course I did. I'm made from
pretty strong stuff, you know.

01:25:45.276 --> 01:25:46.642
What up, dude?

01:25:50.481 --> 01:25:53.178
Okay, here's the plan.
We start here in the south.

01:25:53.251 --> 01:25:55.652
Lay as many eggs as we can. No holding back.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.623
We're talking an eggs-apalozza,
as far as the eye can see.

01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:01.750
Does this mean you're leaving?

01:26:01.826 --> 01:26:03.624
It means you're coming with us.

01:26:03.694 --> 01:26:05.629
Your kingdom's not just in a cave anymore.

01:26:05.696 --> 01:26:08.791
We're going to repopulate
the oceans with billions of eels.

01:26:08.866 --> 01:26:11.836
And lanternfish and crustaceans.

01:26:11.902 --> 01:26:16.169
Yeah, you guys are lucky.
I'm the last one of my species.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.677
- Sure about that?
- Hey, good looking.

01:26:23.748 --> 01:26:25.808
I need to...

01:26:27.184 --> 01:26:28.584
I'll see you guys later.

01:26:40.731 --> 01:26:45.669
- So what do we do now?
- Well, what would a human do?

01:26:45.736 --> 01:26:47.170
- Mother!
- Help!

01:26:48.973 --> 01:26:50.271
I'm a commander!

01:29:16.687 --> 01:29:20.180
<i>When I was just a tiny thing</i>

01:29:20.257 --> 01:29:21.953
You mean today?

01:29:22.026 --> 01:29:25.394
<i>I told my mama, I wanna sing</i>

01:29:25.463 --> 01:29:28.831
<i>She answered me with a kick in the pants</i>

01:29:28.899 --> 01:29:34.497
<i>And said, little prawn, you gotta</i>

01:29:34.572 --> 01:29:38.270
<i>Dance</i>

01:29:38.342 --> 01:29:41.574
<i>Dance</i>

01:29:41.645 --> 01:29:43.307
<i>You trampy little scampi</i>

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:45.406
<i>You dance worse than my Aunt Bea</i>

01:29:48.919 --> 01:29:51.411
<i>Your thighs are flabby crabby</i>

01:29:51.489 --> 01:29:53.617
<i>Like some diseased old tabby</i>

01:29:54.625 --> 01:29:56.423
<i>Disgusting</i>

01:29:56.494 --> 01:29:58.486
<i>Your moves are cramped and campy</i>

01:29:58.562 --> 01:30:00.554
<i>And Broadway star, you can't be</i>

01:30:00.631 --> 01:30:02.156
<i>You've got the give of gabby</i>

01:30:02.233 --> 01:30:04.293
<i>I'm gonna call a cabby</i>

01:30:04.368 --> 01:30:06.064
Hold it, here I go.

01:30:06.136 --> 01:30:07.502
<i>Come on, be selfish</i>

01:30:07.571 --> 01:30:09.836
<i>Shake it little shellfish</i>

01:30:09.907 --> 01:30:12.467
<i>Shake what's in the shell</i>

01:30:12.543 --> 01:30:13.533
Shake it, baby.

01:30:13.611 --> 01:30:14.772
<i>Come on, be selfish</i>

01:30:14.845 --> 01:30:17.178
<i>Shake it little shellfish</i>

01:30:17.248 --> 01:30:20.218
<i>Shake what's in the shell</i>

01:30:20.284 --> 01:30:23.618
<i>Your crab legs are imitation</i>

01:30:23.687 --> 01:30:27.351
<i>You crusty old crustacean</i>

01:30:29.793 --> 01:30:31.489
<i>Spicy like good cocktail sauce</i>

01:30:31.562 --> 01:30:33.724
<i>But Rico shows you who's the boss</i>

01:30:41.138 --> 01:30:42.436
<i>Not total hooey</i>

01:30:42.506 --> 01:30:44.702
<i>My dear crab Louie</i>

01:30:44.775 --> 01:30:48.940
<i>But now your mind will go ka-blooey</i>

01:30:52.283 --> 01:30:53.512
<i>My heart's been netted</i>

01:30:53.584 --> 01:30:55.815
<i>I don't regret it</i>

01:30:55.886 --> 01:30:59.448
<i>You shake me in my shell</i>

01:30:59.523 --> 01:31:00.718
<i>You've got us reeling</i>

01:31:00.791 --> 01:31:03.192
<i>We're through the ceiling</i>

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:06.128
<i>You shake us in our shells</i>

01:31:16.874 --> 01:31:18.706
<i>Shrimp your steps are appetizing</i>

01:31:18.776 --> 01:31:20.938
<i>A recipe that's most surprising</i>

01:31:21.946 --> 01:31:23.938
Oh, that was nice.

01:31:24.014 --> 01:31:27.746
<i>Smooth and sweet, your moves, like butter</i>

01:31:27.818 --> 01:31:31.448
<i>You melt me, darling, like no other</i>

01:31:31.522 --> 01:31:34.720
<i>Stick with me, my little prawn</i>

01:31:34.792 --> 01:31:39.093
<i>We'll dance until the break of dawn</i>

01:31:39.163 --> 01:31:40.461
<i>My heart you've netted</i>

01:31:40.531 --> 01:31:42.727
<i>I don't regret it</i>

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.430
<i>You shake me in my shell</i>

01:31:46.503 --> 01:31:47.801
<i>You've got us reeling</i>

01:31:47.871 --> 01:31:50.272
<i>We're through the ceiling</i>

01:31:50.341 --> 01:31:53.834
<i>You shake us in our shells</i>

01:31:53.911 --> 01:31:55.140
<i>My heart's been netted</i>

01:31:55.212 --> 01:31:57.545
<i>I don't regret it</i>

01:31:57.615 --> 01:32:01.245
<i>You shake me in my shell</i>

01:32:01.318 --> 01:32:02.547
<i>You've got us reeling</i>

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.987
<i>We're through the ceiling</i>

01:32:05.055 --> 01:32:08.389
<i>You shake us in our shells</i>

01:32:08.459 --> 01:32:10.155
I like shaking with you.
