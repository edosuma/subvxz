00:01.217 --> 00:05.210
On the other hand, some physicists are
concerned that if this supercollider works...

00:05.388 --> 00:09.290
...it'll create a black hole and swallow up
the Earth, ending life as we know it.

00:09.459 --> 00:11.484
What a bunch of crybabies.

00:11.661 --> 00:13.925
No guts, no glory, man.

00:14.364 --> 00:15.854
Hey, check it out.

00:16.032 --> 00:19.058
The School of Pharmacology
is looking for volunteers.

00:19.235 --> 00:21.703
"We are testing a new medication
for social anxiety...

00:21.871 --> 00:26.638
...panic attacks, agoraphobia
and obsessive-compulsive disorder."

00:27.510 --> 00:29.774
Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

00:31.114 --> 00:32.375
I don't know, Raj.

00:32.549 --> 00:35.916
Maybe the comic-book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

00:38.822 --> 00:41.222
- What's going on?
- Shh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.

00:42.525 --> 00:43.617
Sheldon's office?

00:45.695 --> 00:47.788
Is she lost?

00:48.264 --> 00:51.563
I don't think so.
I followed her here from the parking lot.

00:53.570 --> 00:57.370
- Maybe she's his lawyer.
- Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.098
- Howard--
- I know, I'm disgusting.

00:59.275 --> 01:00.333
I should be punished.

01:00.510 --> 01:03.377
By her. Oh, look, I did it again.

01:03.546 --> 01:07.448
MISSY: Well, that should do it.
- Thank you for coming by.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.388
Hello.

01:14.557 --> 01:17.993
Oh, hey, buddy.

01:19.229 --> 01:21.390
Buddy?

01:21.564 --> 01:23.930
Sorry I'm late.
I'm working on a project...

01:24.100 --> 01:27.263
...that may take me up
on the next space shuttle.

01:27.437 --> 01:30.338
Well, how can you be late?
I wasn't expecting you at all.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.640
Nobody ever expects me.

01:32.809 --> 01:35.778
Sometimes you just look,
and bam, Howard Wolowitz.

01:37.781 --> 01:41.342
- Sheldon, are you gonna introduce us?
- Oh, all right. This is Missy.

01:41.518 --> 01:45.181
Missy, this is Leonard and Rajesh,
and you've already met Howard.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.687
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too, as well also.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.222
Yeah.

01:51.060 --> 01:52.687
So how do you two know each other?

01:53.229 --> 01:57.632
Oh, he once spent nine months
with my legs wrapped around his head.

02:00.170 --> 02:02.195
Excuse me?

02:02.372 --> 02:03.600
She's my twin sister.

02:03.773 --> 02:07.106
She thinks she's funny, but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

02:07.277 --> 02:10.074
That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

02:10.246 --> 02:12.737
How exactly would one measure
a sense of humor?

02:12.916 --> 02:15.043
A humormometer?

02:17.821 --> 02:21.222
Well, I think you're delightfully droll.
Or as the French say:

02:27.897 --> 02:30.161
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074

02:56.793 --> 02:58.624
Rajesh.

03:22.919 --> 03:25.183
So, Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

03:25.355 --> 03:28.153
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

03:28.324 --> 03:30.383
My friend's getting married at Disneyland.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.859
Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.

03:35.331 --> 03:38.698
And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

03:38.868 --> 03:42.360
The papers could've been mailed. Mom
sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

03:42.538 --> 03:44.836
I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

03:45.008 --> 03:47.670
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

03:48.544 --> 03:51.172
Tell Mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds...

03:51.347 --> 03:54.510
...and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

03:54.684 --> 03:56.379
Enjoy the wedding. Goodbye.

03:56.719 --> 03:58.482
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.587
If the wedding's not till tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?

04:02.759 --> 04:05.728
Oh, I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

04:05.895 --> 04:09.695
Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary
friends home at the end of the day.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.260
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

04:14.270 --> 04:16.567
Look, you're here,
and we have plenty of room.

04:16.738 --> 04:20.470
- No, we don't.
- Come on, Shelly, she's family.

04:20.642 --> 04:24.079
So what?
I don't issue invitations to your mother.

04:24.547 --> 04:27.414
It would be nice not to have to drive
to Anaheim in rush hour.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.608
And don't ever call me Shelly.

04:29.786 --> 04:32.050
So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

04:32.221 --> 04:35.657
I'll walk you to your car.
You're in Structure 3, Level C, right?

04:39.429 --> 04:41.761
What just happened?

04:43.266 --> 04:44.893
So anyway, we're 8 years old...

04:45.068 --> 04:49.437
...and Sheldon converts my Easy-Bake Oven
to some kind of high-powered furnace.

04:49.605 --> 04:52.438
That's just classic.

04:52.842 --> 04:55.640
I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates...

04:55.812 --> 04:57.837
...for homemade integrated circuits.

04:58.014 --> 05:01.711
He was trying to build some sort of
armed robot to keep me out of his room.

05:01.884 --> 05:05.581
Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

05:05.755 --> 05:09.020
Anyway, I make those little muffins
they give you. There's a big flash.

05:09.192 --> 05:11.854
Next thing you know,
my eyebrows are gone.

05:12.996 --> 05:15.521
Not your eyebrows?

05:15.698 --> 05:18.030
Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade...

05:18.201 --> 05:20.795
...with crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.961
Is that what that was? I just assumed...

05:23.139 --> 05:25.630
...that the second-grade curriculum
had rendered you quizzical.

05:25.808 --> 05:27.708
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

05:28.945 --> 05:33.279
Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear
in the drier downstairs.

05:35.385 --> 05:37.182
Pfft.

05:38.955 --> 05:40.320
Those are not mine.

05:41.724 --> 05:45.285
Really? They have
your little name label in them.

05:46.029 --> 05:48.623
Oh, yeah, no, I use those...

05:48.798 --> 05:53.132
...just to polish up
my spearfishing equipment.

05:54.470 --> 05:55.960
I spearfish.

05:59.642 --> 06:02.338
When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

06:05.014 --> 06:08.472
Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister.
Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.

06:08.651 --> 06:10.676
- Hi.
- Wow, you don't look that much alike.

06:10.853 --> 06:13.378
Can I get a hallelujah?

06:14.090 --> 06:16.081
Fraternal twins
come from two separate eggs.

06:16.259 --> 06:18.489
They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

06:18.661 --> 06:20.526
Hallelujah.

06:21.230 --> 06:22.254
Hey, guess what.

06:22.432 --> 06:24.696
I've been accepted as a test subject
for a drug...

06:24.867 --> 06:27.028
...to overcome pathological shyness.

06:27.203 --> 06:30.297
- Oh, good for you, Raj.
- Yes, I'm very hopeful.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.100
Hello, Missy.

06:41.784 --> 06:44.218
They mentioned
there may be side effects.

06:46.255 --> 06:47.847
So, Missy...

06:48.024 --> 06:52.427
...have you ever met a man
from the exotic subcontinent of lndia?

06:53.029 --> 06:57.398
- Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.
- Yes, Patel. Good man.

06:57.567 --> 07:00.627
Do you like motorcycles?
Because I ride a hog.

07:01.304 --> 07:04.705
A hog? You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

07:06.476 --> 07:09.809
You still have to wear a helmet.

07:10.379 --> 07:13.314
- Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
- The sex book.

07:13.483 --> 07:15.451
The lndian sex book.

07:15.618 --> 07:19.315
In other words, if you wonder, wonder
who wrote the book of love...

07:19.489 --> 07:21.252
...it was us.

07:22.592 --> 07:26.187
- So Sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?
- I wasn't staring.

07:27.797 --> 07:30.823
I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.467
Oh. Eh....

07:32.635 --> 07:36.935
Maybe. If you like women who are tall.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.734
And perfect.

07:41.777 --> 07:44.007
Sheldon,
why are you ignoring your sister?

07:44.180 --> 07:48.173
I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

07:48.351 --> 07:49.841
I brought snacks.

07:50.019 --> 07:53.511
Oh, my. Gherkins and....

07:54.023 --> 07:56.184
Onion dip. It's onion dip.

07:58.661 --> 08:01.221
We don't entertain much.

08:02.532 --> 08:05.797
Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?

08:05.968 --> 08:09.165
- I guess.
- Yeah, we lndians invented them.

08:09.705 --> 08:11.536
You're welcome.

08:12.542 --> 08:15.511
Yeah, well,
my people invented circumcision.

08:20.016 --> 08:21.506
You're welcome.

08:23.152 --> 08:25.780
Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.
Do you wanna come?

08:25.955 --> 08:28.219
God, yes. Thanks.

08:28.391 --> 08:30.222
You're welcome.

08:30.993 --> 08:32.392
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Missy.

08:32.562 --> 08:33.722
Bye, Missy, see you.

08:33.895 --> 08:37.092
- Goodbye, Leonard.
- Yeah, no, bye, Penny.

08:38.668 --> 08:41.602
- You two have to back off.
- Why should I back off? You back off.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.968
Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

08:45.141 --> 08:47.575
- So what? You've got Penny.
- How do I have Penny?

08:47.743 --> 08:49.802
In what universe do I have Penny?

08:51.013 --> 08:53.481
- So I can have Penny?
- Hell, no.

08:54.650 --> 08:57.585
Excuse me, can I interject something?

08:58.421 --> 09:01.686
I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

09:03.759 --> 09:07.024
- Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
- I guess.

09:07.563 --> 09:09.861
Don't worry,
I was going to order you cheese-less.

09:10.032 --> 09:11.363
- Thank you.
SHELDON: It's okay.

is nothing to be embarrassed about.

[IN INDIAN ACCENT] I'm a fancy
lndian man. We invented pajamas.

09:29.952 --> 09:31.613
Sheldon.

09:33.556 --> 09:36.855
Are you aware that your sister
is an incredibly attractive woman?

09:38.094 --> 09:39.459
Hm.

09:39.629 --> 09:44.032
She has the symmetry and low body fat
that Western culture deems desirable.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.464
It's noteworthy that at other points
in history...

09:46.636 --> 09:51.573
...heavier women were the standard for
beauty because girth suggested affluence.

09:51.874 --> 09:54.069
- That's fascinating--
- I didn't say fascinating.

09:54.243 --> 09:55.710
I said it was noteworthy.

09:56.579 --> 09:59.241
All right. Noted.

09:59.415 --> 10:03.044
But my point
is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz....

10:03.219 --> 10:07.087
They're hitting on your sister.
Ugh. It's....

10:07.990 --> 10:12.484
Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want
to criticize your rhetorical style...

10:12.662 --> 10:15.062
...but we'd be further along
in this conversation...

10:15.231 --> 10:17.222
...if you'd begun with that thought.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.965
That's great, but--

10:19.135 --> 10:22.229
We took quite a detour
from what I understand to be your thesis.

10:22.405 --> 10:23.963
Whatever.

10:24.974 --> 10:27.807
- You have to do something about it.
- Why?

10:27.977 --> 10:29.740
Because she's your sister.

10:30.946 --> 10:32.641
I don't understand.

10:32.815 --> 10:35.215
Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.615
But since then, we've pretty much gone
our own separate ways.

10:39.322 --> 10:41.790
Okay, consider this.

10:41.957 --> 10:45.518
With your father gone,
it is your responsibility...

10:45.695 --> 10:48.994
...to make sure
that Missy chooses a suitable mate.

10:50.766 --> 10:53.098
I hadn't considered that.

10:53.369 --> 10:55.098
We do share DNA.

10:55.271 --> 10:57.364
So there is the possibility,
however remote...

10:57.540 --> 11:00.941
...that resting in her loins
is the potential for another individual...

11:01.110 --> 11:03.874
...as remarkable as myself.

11:04.046 --> 11:09.040
Exactly. And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity...

11:09.218 --> 11:13.120
...to protect the genetic integrity
of your sister's future offspring.

11:15.124 --> 11:18.787
You're right. If someone wants
to get at Missy's fallopian tubes...

You stop it. You stop it, I say.

11:45.554 --> 11:47.647
I'm gonna settle this right now.

Neither of you are good enough
for my sister.

11:50.426 --> 11:52.018
Who are you to decide that?

11:52.194 --> 11:54.890
He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.

11:55.064 --> 11:57.658
- You're out too, by the way.
- Say what?

11:57.833 --> 12:00.165
Nothing personal.

- I'm not happy.

12:13.249 --> 12:16.241
It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

12:23.626 --> 12:26.857
Now that Leonard's made me aware
of how high the genetic stakes are...

12:27.029 --> 12:30.396
...we have to face the fact
that none of you are suitable for my sister.

12:30.566 --> 12:34.127
Wait a minute,
Leonard made you aware of that?

12:35.037 --> 12:37.505

12:51.353 --> 12:52.945
In principle, you have a point.

But as a practical matter, need I remind you
it takes experimental pharmaceuticals...

...to simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex?

13:01.030 --> 13:04.727
I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

13:10.105 --> 13:11.265
Is it because I'm Jewish?

13:11.440 --> 13:14.932
Because I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop
to be with your sister.

13:21.484 --> 13:23.213
This has nothing to do with religion.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.853
This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny man...

13:52.948 --> 13:55.940
Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

14:01.690 --> 14:04.181
We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

14:05.861 --> 14:07.260
Okay.

14:07.429 --> 14:11.024
I'm not even gonna ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese...

14:11.867 --> 14:15.098
...but since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?

14:15.271 --> 14:17.432
Truthfully,
I've never given it any thought...

14:17.606 --> 14:21.167
...but it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.

14:21.343 --> 14:24.073
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Let me explain.

14:24.246 --> 14:27.647
You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation...

14:27.816 --> 14:30.683
...an improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.116
And what do you mean,
"mediocre stock"?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.383
That would be you.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.225
But residing within you
is the potential for another me.

14:41.397 --> 14:44.594
Perhaps even taller, smarter
and less prone to freckling.

14:44.767 --> 14:48.259
A Sheldon 2.0, if you will.

14:48.771 --> 14:51.604
- Sheldon 2.0?
- Exactly.

14:51.774 --> 14:55.505
Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.

14:55.678 --> 14:59.239
If you're not attracted, then the likelihood
of conception will be reduced.

14:59.415 --> 15:01.883
- You have got to be kidding me.
- Not at all.

15:02.051 --> 15:05.316
Frequent coitus dramatically increases
the odds of fertilization.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.423
Okay, Shelly, sit down.

15:11.927 --> 15:15.522
Now, I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is...

15:15.698 --> 15:19.657
...as Mom puts it,
one of God's special little people.

15:20.569 --> 15:22.867
I always thought
I was more like a cuckoo bird.

15:23.038 --> 15:27.099
A superior creature whose egg is placed
in the nest of ordinary birds.

15:27.276 --> 15:29.335
The newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food...

15:29.511 --> 15:32.537
...Ieaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.

15:33.148 --> 15:35.946
Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

15:37.586 --> 15:39.781
I thought it ended at cuckoo.

15:42.157 --> 15:43.454
Now, you listen to me.

15:43.626 --> 15:46.857
If you wanna start acting like a brother
who cares about me, terrific.

15:47.229 --> 15:48.696
Bring it on.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.799
But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with...

15:51.967 --> 15:56.734
...and you and I are gonna go round the way
we did when we were little. Remember?

16:00.275 --> 16:02.539
- I have an alternate proposal.
- Go on.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.238
You donate eggs.
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

16:06.415 --> 16:09.350
I will find an appropriate sperm donor
for your eggs...

16:09.518 --> 16:12.009
...have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

16:12.187 --> 16:13.484
That way, everybody wins.

16:22.931 --> 16:26.799
Correction.
Missy can date whoever she wants.

16:28.504 --> 16:31.064
- Look, we have to settle this.
- I agree.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.869
Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's
because we've all been hitting on her.

16:35.044 --> 16:39.344
She's not hiding. She needed to call her
grandmother, who's apparently very sick.

16:39.515 --> 16:42.245
Oh, and then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

16:42.951 --> 16:45.511
Oh, you poor deluded bastard.

16:45.688 --> 16:47.883
- Don't start with me, dude.
- You wanna go again?

16:48.057 --> 16:50.025
- Sit down.
- Okay.

16:50.859 --> 16:53.555
If we're gonna fight over Missy,
let's do it the right way.

16:53.729 --> 16:55.219
The honorable way.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.625

Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

while I go tell Missy the good news.

17:31.567 --> 17:33.034

- Hi, Penny, how's it going?

17:33.202 --> 17:35.898
That guy Mike that you were dating,
is that still going on?

17:36.071 --> 17:37.732
- Pretty much, why?
- Just catching up.

17:37.906 --> 17:40.272
By the way,
may I speak to Missy, please?

17:41.510 --> 17:43.603
Of course.

17:44.646 --> 17:45.874
Hi, Leonard, what's up?

17:46.048 --> 17:50.109
Well, since you're leaving, I was wondering
if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

17:50.285 --> 17:52.378
That's so sweet. But no, thanks.

17:54.223 --> 17:55.485
Oh.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.217
- Do you have other plans or--?
- No.

18:01.797 --> 18:03.264
All right.

18:04.633 --> 18:08.694
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thanks, I'll see you.

18:14.443 --> 18:18.243
Um, here's something
we didn't anticipate.

18:23.752 --> 18:28.451
- What do you want, Howard?
- I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

- The Amazing Howard.

- Not really, no.

to pass along to Mom?

that I've refocused my research...

...from bosonic string theory
to heterotic string theory.
