WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:03.399
Previously on "Timeless..."

00:03.400 --> 00:04.969
- I'm going to die.
- What?

00:04.970 --> 00:06.349
On one of our next trips.

00:06.350 --> 00:07.849
Jiya saw it in a vision of hers.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.649
Did you ever think that maybe
you are seeing these things

00:10.650 --> 00:12.249
so that you can save Rufus?

00:12.250 --> 00:14.449
Let's to see what
Rittenhouse has been hiding.

00:14.450 --> 00:16.219
- That's Jessica.
- Who's that?

00:16.219 --> 00:18.889
Kevin, my brother you shoot
pool with all the time.

00:18.890 --> 00:20.720
- Not in my timeline.
- What do you mean?

00:20.730 --> 00:23.790
- He died before he was three.
- No, he didn't, Wyatt.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.559
Is there something
you're not telling me?

00:25.560 --> 00:26.859
Yeah, there is.

00:29.600 --> 00:30.900
I'm pregnant.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:44.120 --> 00:46.549
Colonel Ryerson, sir,
you have a visitor.

00:46.550 --> 00:48.749
It's a young woman?

00:48.750 --> 00:50.590
All right, send her on in.

00:59.330 --> 01:01.199
I brought you something from home.

01:10.140 --> 01:13.679
So, uh, no letters or
photos from my wife?

01:13.680 --> 01:17.010
It's been a little
chaotic since you left.

01:17.020 --> 01:19.100
Come on, when's the last
time you had a cheeseburger?

01:20.630 --> 01:22.299
A nearby Union regiment is about to raid

01:22.300 --> 01:24.550
the plantations along
the Combahee River.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.819
You're going to stop them.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.829
All the details you need are in here.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.929
Pull this off, and you're
back home with your wife

01:35.930 --> 01:37.630
and all the cheeseburgers you can eat.

01:43.980 --> 01:47.279
It's this way.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.040
Why did you bring me here?

01:49.050 --> 01:51.810
To talk about Emma.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.880
I realize you two have had your issues.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.419
Please. I don't care about any of that.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.209
And I don't care that
you're sleeping together.

01:59.210 --> 02:00.879
I don't trust her.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.000
Why do you say that?

02:02.010 --> 02:04.259
I think she's sabotaging the missions.

02:04.260 --> 02:06.290
The Suffragette movement of 1919.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.699
That should've been easy.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.899
And yet somehow, the mission fails,

02:09.900 --> 02:12.970
and Emma is the only
one to come back alive.

02:12.980 --> 02:15.709
If you asked Emma, she'd
say that Lucy is to blame.

02:15.710 --> 02:17.209
You're my grandfather,

02:17.210 --> 02:19.509
and I have the greatest respect for you,

02:19.510 --> 02:21.780
but quit thinking with your crotch.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.449
- Excuse me?
- You're blind.

02:24.450 --> 02:26.849
Emma's been a part of almost every one

02:26.850 --> 02:28.260
of these failed missions,

02:28.270 --> 02:30.489
but each time you blame Lucy?

02:30.490 --> 02:32.289
The fact is,

02:32.290 --> 02:36.059
Rittenhouse is in
Lucy's blood, not Emma's.

02:36.060 --> 02:38.790
Rittenhouse is about family.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.560
It's about legacy.

02:41.570 --> 02:44.410
Something Emma will never understand.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.279
- My daughter.
- Yes.

03:03.390 --> 03:05.390
My mother.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.230
She was two when I left.

03:11.630 --> 03:14.599
I never got to see her...

03:14.600 --> 03:16.099
grow up.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.799
You sacrificed everything
for Rittenhouse.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.469
For her.

03:21.470 --> 03:23.140
For me, one day.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.709
Emma isn't family.

03:28.710 --> 03:32.249
Her faith is fleeting.

03:32.250 --> 03:36.349
She doesn't believe in you like I do.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.090
You wanted to see us?

03:46.530 --> 03:48.529
- Wait, where's Flynn?
- I think he's still asleep.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.550
You ever hear him
snoring? Dude needs a CPAP.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.089
No Flynn, just you three.

03:52.090 --> 03:54.739
What we're about to tell
you stays between us,

03:54.740 --> 03:56.040
for Wyatt's sake.

03:56.940 --> 03:58.070
For my sake?

03:58.080 --> 04:00.679
I found some, shall we say,

04:00.680 --> 04:04.789
troubling files on the
Rittenhouse computers.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.990
Is that Jessica?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.099
When was that taken?

04:10.100 --> 04:11.600
There are hundreds of these,

04:11.610 --> 04:13.790
going all the way back
to Jessica's childhood.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.359
Rittenhouse has been following Jessica

04:15.360 --> 04:16.689
her entire life?

04:16.690 --> 04:18.329
Why would they do that?

04:18.339 --> 04:19.659
That's what we've been
trying to figure out

04:19.660 --> 04:20.760
for a week now.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.850
You've known about this for a week?

04:24.750 --> 04:27.039
- You're just now telling me?
- Look.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.019
I'm treading cautiously here.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.270
But Rittenhouse brought Jessica

04:30.280 --> 04:32.059
back from the dead for a reason, Wyatt.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.439
Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you saying

04:33.440 --> 04:35.789
Jessica works for Rittenhouse?

04:35.790 --> 04:38.379
The truth is, we don't know who she is.

04:38.380 --> 04:40.379
Yeah, we do, she's my wife.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.119
I've known her since high school.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.519
No, Wyatt, to be precise,

04:44.520 --> 04:48.389
you knew a Jessica
who sadly passed away.

04:48.390 --> 04:51.059
This Jessica could be different.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.899
Do you have any reason at all
to suspect Jessica of anything?

04:56.900 --> 04:58.389
Come on.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.769
This is insane.

04:59.770 --> 05:01.039
If she were Rittenhouse,

05:01.040 --> 05:02.539
wouldn't she have
tried to kill us by now

05:02.540 --> 05:03.599
or given up our location?

05:03.600 --> 05:04.789
Exactly, thank you.

05:04.790 --> 05:06.509
Wyatt, I'm moving her out of the bunker.

05:06.510 --> 05:08.779
It's the safest thing
for Jessica and for us.

05:08.780 --> 05:10.730
- Wait, wait, what?
- Wouldn't that put her in danger

05:10.740 --> 05:11.930
if she's not Rittenhouse?

05:11.940 --> 05:14.480
We will provide her with
around-the-clock protection.

05:14.490 --> 05:15.700
Jessica's not going anywhere.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.989
I know this isn't easy for
you, but you're a soldier,

05:17.990 --> 05:19.689
and you need to think of the mission.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.389
Jessica's a potential security risk.

05:21.390 --> 05:23.100
She's pregnant.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.559
You throw her out, I go too.

05:32.570 --> 05:34.039
She's what?

05:34.040 --> 05:35.800
I think he just said she's pregnant.

05:37.810 --> 05:40.709
That went well.

05:47.790 --> 05:52.240
- Synced and corrected by VitoSilans -
-- www.Addic7ed.com --

05:59.310 --> 06:02.499
South Carolina, June the 1st, 1863.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.189
We're going back to the Civil War again.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.229
Yay.

06:05.230 --> 06:07.489
- So why South Carolina?
- I don't know.

06:07.490 --> 06:09.120
Fort Sumter was a
couple of years before.

06:09.130 --> 06:11.210
The assault on Fort Wagner
isn't for another month.

06:11.220 --> 06:12.519
Wait, wait, wait.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.160
What about the Combahee River Raid?

06:15.350 --> 06:16.719
Oh, um, of course.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.929
It was that night.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.530
Oh, come on, Lucy,
defend your territory.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.059
You're the history geek.

06:21.060 --> 06:23.649
It was a regiment of
mostly Black Union soldiers

06:23.650 --> 06:25.199
who planned a surprise attack

06:25.200 --> 06:27.899
on dozens of plantations
in the middle of the night.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.669
Torched fields. Freed
hundreds of slaves.

06:30.670 --> 06:33.739
If Rittenhouse stops it, it's
a serious blow to the Union.

06:33.740 --> 06:35.669
Attagirl, show 'em who's boss.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.939
There's more.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.640
It was led by Harriet Tubman.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.809
You think Rittenhouse
is trying to derail

06:43.810 --> 06:45.419
- the Underground Railroad?
- No.

06:45.420 --> 06:47.819
The Underground Railroad was
humming for years before that.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.140
During the war, Tubman
was actually a Union spy.

06:50.150 --> 06:52.589
- They called her...
- They called her "The General."

06:52.590 --> 06:54.020
How'd you know that?

06:54.030 --> 06:55.759
Oh, well, she's not
just an American hero.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.359
Uh, across the pond we even
have streets named after her.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.199
So they are going after
Tubman and her men.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.469
Wyatt.

07:02.470 --> 07:04.030
You have anything you'd like to add?

07:04.040 --> 07:05.149
Why?

07:05.150 --> 07:07.819
Obviously you all are
the experts at everything.

07:10.410 --> 07:12.079
Let's get going.

07:13.710 --> 07:15.409
She better be here when I get back.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.550
You have my word.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.389
Sure you're gonna be
okay while I'm gone?

07:29.390 --> 07:31.790
I'm not the one I'm worried about.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.599
Yes, I'll be fine.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.789
Turns out pregnancy just
makes me wanna binge-watch

07:35.790 --> 07:37.230
"This Is Us" and ugly cry,

07:37.240 --> 07:39.429
so I'll get it all out of
my system before you're back.

07:40.740 --> 07:42.609
We gotta tell your
family the good news soon.

07:42.610 --> 07:43.809
Sure.

07:43.810 --> 07:46.139
As soon as we get out
this dank, rusty hellhole,

07:46.140 --> 07:48.709
I will send out the
invitations for the baby shower.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.980
I know. I'm sorry.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.149
I know you wanna see 'em.

07:54.150 --> 07:55.949
I wanna see 'em too.

07:55.950 --> 07:58.719
Hell, I never even met your brother.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.990
Mm-hmm.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.590
What?

08:03.600 --> 08:06.660
It's just weird

08:06.670 --> 08:09.529
how much you've been talking
about my brother lately.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.769
Well, it's, uh...

08:11.770 --> 08:13.200
It is kind of weird.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.039
You know?

08:15.040 --> 08:17.309
In my timeline, he died when
he was three from leukemia,

08:17.310 --> 08:19.789
and now he's suddenly alive and kicking.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.250
- It's...
- So am I.

08:21.260 --> 08:24.320
- That's a good thing, right?
- Yes, of course.

08:30.460 --> 08:33.188
Are you sure you don't
remember how he was cured?

08:33.190 --> 08:35.089
Or who cured him, or why, or anything?

08:35.090 --> 08:37.159
- I mean, it's just...
- I was a kid.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.059
Would you rather he'd have died?

08:40.070 --> 08:43.068
No, come on.

08:43.070 --> 08:44.960
I'm sorry.

08:46.970 --> 08:49.169
Now, are you going
to answer my question?

08:49.170 --> 08:51.639
The important one?

08:51.640 --> 08:53.180
What question?

08:54.350 --> 08:55.509
Boy or girl?

08:57.880 --> 09:00.849
Ah, hmm...

09:00.850 --> 09:03.189
Let's see.

09:03.190 --> 09:04.920
I will take either one.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.729
- Girl.
- You can't say that.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.859
- Girl, 100%.
- What if it's a boy?

09:09.860 --> 09:11.129
Then I will love him...

09:11.130 --> 09:12.769
almost as much as a girl.

09:12.770 --> 09:14.789
And we'll just... we'll
just try and try and try

09:14.790 --> 09:15.790
until we get one.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.359
You are truly awful.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.460
You are.

09:28.910 --> 09:30.480
Be careful.

09:31.980 --> 09:34.149
Yeah.

09:53.940 --> 09:56.139
I don't think you should
be angry at Christopher.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.370
She's just trying to protect us.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.479
Who's angry?

09:59.480 --> 10:01.049
I'm just reading a map.

10:01.050 --> 10:04.049
Look, I get how hard this
Jessica thing must be,

10:04.050 --> 10:06.880
but we just have to keep an open mind.

10:06.890 --> 10:08.919
Yeah, an open mind.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.189
That my wife is a cult-loving,
sociopathic traitor.

10:12.190 --> 10:14.059
Rittenhouse took those
photos for a reason.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.459
They brought her back for a reason.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.190
Yes, to distract us, in which case,

10:17.200 --> 10:19.199
Christopher freaking out
is exactly what they want.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.299
I hope so. We just...

10:21.300 --> 10:22.799
We have to be sure.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.469
What do you want me to say, Lucy?

10:24.470 --> 10:26.239
That my wife is a liar?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.370
Hell, maybe she's lying
about being pregnant too.

10:31.950 --> 10:33.819
You do think she's lying about that.

10:33.820 --> 10:36.749
If Rittenhouse doesn't kill
us, the mosquitoes will.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.549
Is West Nile a thing yet?

10:38.550 --> 10:42.729
No, but typhoid and dysentery
killed about 150,000 soldiers.

10:42.730 --> 10:45.159
So, better wash your vegetables.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.000
What's up with Captain Sunshine?

11:06.280 --> 11:09.919
This must be the 2nd South Carolina.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.659
They were the only Union
regiment in the area.

11:13.660 --> 11:15.390
Tell me it's not the same
regiment that's supposed to

11:15.400 --> 11:17.660
raid the plantation tonight.

11:17.670 --> 11:19.089
Afraid so.

11:19.090 --> 11:20.580
This wasn't supposed to happen.

11:20.590 --> 11:23.510
Looks like the Confederates
took them by surprise.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.769
Rittenhouse must have a
Sleeper in the Confederate Army

11:25.770 --> 11:27.299
telling them what to do.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.099
So we're too late?

11:29.100 --> 11:32.369
History's already changed?
The South's gonna win?

11:34.170 --> 11:36.039
Help.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.309
Please. Help.

11:42.310 --> 11:46.219
Please. Help me die.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.280
Help me die easy.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.019
We'll find a doctor for you.

11:52.020 --> 11:54.559
No, no.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.529
Please. Mercy.

11:57.530 --> 12:00.829
Give me a gun and I'll do it myself.

12:12.650 --> 12:16.919
What's wrong with you, not
helping a soldier in need?

12:16.920 --> 12:19.019
You're Harriet Tubman.

12:19.020 --> 12:20.149
You're alive.

12:20.150 --> 12:23.719
But you won't be for long.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.210
Now, who the hell are you?

12:30.900 --> 12:33.740
You don't know us, but we know you.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.519
You are a legend where we're from.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.919
Where's that?

12:37.920 --> 12:39.189
Sound like Yankees.

12:39.190 --> 12:41.319
General McClellan

12:41.320 --> 12:43.189
sent us to help you
and Colonel Montgomery

12:43.190 --> 12:44.390
with the raid tonight.

12:48.730 --> 12:51.760
I was just thinking
you look familiar to me.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.460
- I seen you before?
- No.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.999
We're from really, really far up north.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.339
Well, you're late.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.209
Damn Rebs came from out of nowhere.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.010
Like they knew right where to go.

13:01.020 --> 13:02.440
Colonel Montgomery retreated.

13:02.450 --> 13:03.939
Took all of his men along with him.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.359
Do you know where the Rebs are now?

13:05.360 --> 13:06.579
No.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.619
But I aim to find out
and slit their throats

13:08.620 --> 13:10.919
- before the night's out.
- You can't continue the raid.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.609
Montgomery's gone, and
so are most of your men.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.689
Most, but not all.

13:14.690 --> 13:17.020
Got some recuperating
at a safe house nearby.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.919
Wait, we are hunting a Confederate spy,

13:20.920 --> 13:22.299
the one who led the attack on you here.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.300
If you would just give us a minute,

13:23.300 --> 13:24.230
let us do our job.

13:24.231 --> 13:25.599
If you think I'm gonna stand down,

13:25.600 --> 13:27.569
you don't know me very well.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.099
You wanna find your spy?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.539
I'll let you join us.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.709
But get in my way,

13:32.710 --> 13:34.540
I shoot you my damn self.

13:36.710 --> 13:38.240
Dude.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.949
Harriet Tubman's hardcore.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.519
Yeah.

13:46.090 --> 13:47.289
Where have you been?

13:47.290 --> 13:49.619
I wanna meet Stanley Fisher.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.159
I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.959
You don't? Let me refresh your memory.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.459
The time machine pilot
you've had locked away

13:55.460 --> 13:57.460
in a mental hospital. Hmm?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.429
The one who has had
similar visions to mine.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.040
The one that you've been hiding

14:01.050 --> 14:02.209
from me and Rufus.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.710
I haven't been hiding anything.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.800
Don't you dare.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.260
What I've been going through,

14:06.270 --> 14:08.169
and you knew someone going
through the same thing

14:08.170 --> 14:10.779
- and you didn't tell me.
- Where did you get all this...

14:10.780 --> 14:12.979
Oh, that's where you were.

14:12.980 --> 14:14.479
Hacking into my laptop.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.000
- Take me to Stanley Fisher.
- Why?

14:17.010 --> 14:18.279
"Why?"

14:18.280 --> 14:20.759
Maybe because he can help
me understand my visions.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.120
And then I can help Rufus.

14:22.130 --> 14:25.299
Look, he...

14:25.300 --> 14:28.009
The reason I didn't tell you is
'cause I wanted to protect you.

14:28.010 --> 14:29.659
You're not gonna learn
anything about your visions

14:29.660 --> 14:31.429
from Stanley Fisher. The
man's as mad as a hatter.

14:31.430 --> 14:34.599
I don't need protection, I need answers.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.339
You're gonna keep hounding me
till my dying day, aren't you?

14:37.340 --> 14:38.439
Without question.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.109
All right.

14:40.110 --> 14:42.880
I'll see if Agent Christopher
will let us up for some air.

14:46.980 --> 14:49.519
That went better than I thought.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.959
All right now.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.629
What's she giving him?

15:02.630 --> 15:04.829
She knows all sorts of herbal remedies.

15:04.830 --> 15:07.959
She was a nurse, a
cook, a spy, a soldier.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.669
She had to fight for a military pension.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.539
Still didn't get it. Died in poverty.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.309
But if she goes on this raid,

15:13.310 --> 15:15.839
she's gonna die a lot sooner than that.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.879
This is Samuel.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.300
Tell 'em what you told me.

15:22.310 --> 15:24.319
I've seen the Rebs at the
Willow Glen Plantation.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.849
Ran here as fast as I could.

15:25.850 --> 15:28.089
- Brave kid.
- Willow Glen's just up river.

15:28.090 --> 15:29.889
Whole lot of slaves
there who could help us.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.959
And a lot of Confederates
who could kill you.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.700
Start mustering.

15:33.710 --> 15:36.539
You said you had men. I see a
half-dozen here. Where's the rest?

15:36.540 --> 15:38.699
We'll make over a hundred
with the slaves we free.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.830
They're unarmed, fighting
soldiers with guns.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.940
And I would give every drop
of my blood to free them.

15:43.950 --> 15:46.000
What're you fighting
for if it ain't for this?

15:46.010 --> 15:48.340
We're with you. We are.

15:48.350 --> 15:50.730
But it's important that we
find this Confederate spy

15:50.740 --> 15:52.469
or every battle that we
fight from here on out

15:52.470 --> 15:53.700
will be a losing one.

15:56.380 --> 15:57.549
All right.

15:57.550 --> 15:58.919
I'll help you get to your spy,

15:58.920 --> 16:00.889
but then I'm freeing those slaves.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.889
- You hear me?
- We hear you.

16:02.890 --> 16:07.290
Believe me, we are not
gonna lose this freaking war.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.699
We leave at dark.

16:13.870 --> 16:15.869
To Colonel Ryerson,

16:15.870 --> 16:18.660
for his heroic defeat of those
back shootin' Blue-bellies.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.499
And for saving our grand
plantations along the river.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.209
- Hear, hear.
- Gentlemen.

16:23.210 --> 16:25.709
Gentlemen, there should be
many more battles to come.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.349
In fact, scouts tell me Union regiments

16:28.350 --> 16:30.280
are converging on Vicksburg.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.849
We leave at dawn.

16:31.850 --> 16:35.389
Face them on the road
before they join forces.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.020
Should be easy pickings.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.789
Hear, hear.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.479
Where'd you get that?

16:58.480 --> 17:00.009
Harriet insists.

17:00.010 --> 17:02.539
I tried to tell her I am covered, but...

17:02.540 --> 17:04.909
she's a little stubborn,
in case you haven't noticed.

17:04.910 --> 17:05.989
I noticed.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.638
She's going in outnumbered three-to-one.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.236
Well, we'll just have
to get in and get out

17:09.260 --> 17:10.489
before things get too messy.

17:10.490 --> 17:12.789
You mean before her and
her men are all killed?

17:12.790 --> 17:14.638
Hey, if you think you can talk her down,

17:14.640 --> 17:15.829
have at it.

17:15.829 --> 17:17.460
Besides, we need her to show us the way.

17:18.770 --> 17:21.669
- I have a different idea.
- Yeah? What's that?

17:21.670 --> 17:23.839
You and Rufus go with Harriet,

17:23.839 --> 17:27.138
and Flynn and I will ride to Port Royal

17:27.140 --> 17:28.659
to convince Colonel Montgomery

17:28.660 --> 17:30.649
to give her the troops
that she needs for the raid.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.749
You and Flynn?

17:32.750 --> 17:35.249
Of course.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.449
You and Rufus are a better team.

17:37.450 --> 17:40.450
Yeah, I suppose we are.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.920
And Harriet likes you.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.200
Just delay her for a few hours

17:46.210 --> 17:47.700
till we get back with the troops.

17:47.710 --> 17:49.490
- Can you do that?
- I'll do my best.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.070
I've got it, Wyatt.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.879
I appreciate you trying,

18:05.880 --> 18:07.910
but Colonel Montgomery
ain't coming back.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.390
He has new orders.

18:09.490 --> 18:11.280
He'll come back when I
tell him what'll happen

18:11.290 --> 18:13.319
- if he doesn't.
- Oh, yeah?

18:13.320 --> 18:14.750
What's that?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.789
That the Union will lose the war.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.520
Confederate territory the entire way.

18:18.530 --> 18:21.130
I can handle a couple of
farmers playing soldier.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.160
Just...

18:25.170 --> 18:26.470
be careful.

18:27.870 --> 18:30.239
We'll come back with reinforcements.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.069
Don't start the party without us.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.679
It actually fits pretty well.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.949
Thank you. Glad to help.

18:58.950 --> 19:02.059
Lots of people 'round
here siding with the devil.

19:02.060 --> 19:03.820
Plenty of decent folk too.

19:03.830 --> 19:05.119
I'd like some extra crispy

19:05.120 --> 19:06.599
chicken tenders, Colonel Sanders.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.989
You're a riot.

19:07.990 --> 19:10.289
So, I figured I'd go in with him, uh,

19:10.290 --> 19:11.859
as a freed man.

19:11.860 --> 19:15.359
Boy, we're sneaking
you in as a house slave.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.229
We'll get you your clothes next.

19:17.230 --> 19:19.129
Got it. Right.

19:19.130 --> 19:22.070
So, Colonel, can you do an accent?

19:22.170 --> 19:23.439
Nah.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.840
How y'all doin'?

19:24.850 --> 19:26.660
Okay, less J.R. from "Dallas,"

19:26.670 --> 19:27.969
more Leo from "Django Unchained."

19:27.970 --> 19:30.039
Wha... who? And what?

19:30.040 --> 19:32.959
Uh, these guys from back home.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.589
Boy, you do too much talkin'.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.010
They'll find you out real fast.

19:36.020 --> 19:37.379
She's right, drop the accent.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.619
- Leo was overacting anyway.
- I will keep it subtle.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.250
Just make it quick.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.389
As soon as we free our
brothers and sisters,

19:43.390 --> 19:44.889
we're setting fire to those fields,

19:44.890 --> 19:46.520
whether or not your friends are back

19:46.530 --> 19:48.099
with Montgomery's reinforcements.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.699
Can you just try to wait
until we find the spy?

19:51.700 --> 19:54.440
Ma'am. It's important.

19:54.450 --> 19:57.339
This could actually win
the war for the Union.

19:57.340 --> 19:58.869
You ain't stopping me.

19:58.870 --> 20:00.639
We'd be crazy to try, Ms. Tubman.

20:04.240 --> 20:08.749
Now I realize why you look so familiar.

20:08.750 --> 20:12.299
God came to me in a dream
and told me you was coming.

20:14.150 --> 20:17.259
Lord works in mysterious ways.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.309
I'd introduce you, but as you can see,

20:39.310 --> 20:42.910
he's not very, um, sociable.

20:44.980 --> 20:46.619
Is he always like this?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.949
95% of the time.

20:48.950 --> 20:51.389
His muscles have atrophied,

20:51.390 --> 20:54.259
even though he's perfectly
capable of getting out of bed.

20:54.260 --> 20:56.630
Well, at least, he was.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.659
He's having a vision.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.720
You're having visions too?

21:10.780 --> 21:12.810
Stanley, this is Jiya.

21:12.820 --> 21:14.610
Jiya, meet Stanley.

21:14.620 --> 21:17.410
Still training pilots, I see.

21:17.420 --> 21:20.419
Out of necessity, I'm afraid.

21:22.690 --> 21:26.659
Tell me, Connor, have you ever wondered

21:26.660 --> 21:29.809
what it must've been
like to know Genghis Khan,

21:29.810 --> 21:32.350
Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler?

21:33.460 --> 21:36.799
In my visions...

21:36.800 --> 21:39.039
My visions...

21:39.040 --> 21:41.139
I've seen the most evil men in history

21:41.140 --> 21:42.930
doing unimaginable things.

21:42.940 --> 21:44.870
Yes, and your point being?

21:47.240 --> 21:49.179
- You're worse.
- Oh, right, there you go.

21:49.180 --> 21:50.949
You hear that? Worse than Hitler.

21:50.950 --> 21:53.049
Someone call "The Guinness
Book of World Records"

21:53.050 --> 21:55.149
and tell them there's
a new worst person ever.

21:55.150 --> 21:58.459
How many mental trips have you taken?

21:59.950 --> 22:01.809
Uh, I don't know.

22:01.810 --> 22:04.629
Have you seen any new colors yet?

22:04.630 --> 22:06.759
New colors?

22:06.760 --> 22:10.430
The forbidden colors.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.999
Um, no, I... I don't think I have.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.440
You will.

22:16.010 --> 22:17.450
And you'll love them.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.450
Are you ready?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.450
Another day at the office.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.959
So, you know we're friends, right?

22:40.960 --> 22:44.169
Like, bro code and all
that. I got your back.

22:44.170 --> 22:47.139
Rufus, whatever you're
gonna say, just say it.

22:47.140 --> 22:48.900
It's about Jessica.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.909
- You seemed a little defensive.
- Stop.

22:50.910 --> 22:52.339
Not another word.

22:52.340 --> 22:54.290
Oh, like now... now?
Totally not defensive.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.779
She isn't Rittenhouse.

22:55.780 --> 22:57.609
It's not true.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.479
I hope you're right,
I think you're right,

23:00.480 --> 23:01.859
but there is a lot at stake here.

23:01.860 --> 23:04.100
- We just gotta be sure.
- It can't be true.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.689
'Cause if it is...

23:11.890 --> 23:13.490
I'm done.

23:15.830 --> 23:17.700
I lost her once, I just...

23:19.770 --> 23:20.969
Can't lose her again.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.539
I just can't.

23:29.310 --> 23:31.779
I-I-I get it.

23:31.780 --> 23:34.210
I'm just asking you to consider it.

23:34.220 --> 23:36.919
If there is anything
with her or her family

23:36.920 --> 23:41.089
that doesn't add up, just say something.

23:41.090 --> 23:42.289
That's all.

24:02.950 --> 24:05.050
How long you been free?

24:07.550 --> 24:08.880
All my life.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.589
You're lucky.

24:13.590 --> 24:17.220
I know.

24:17.230 --> 24:21.029
You said God told you we were coming,

24:21.030 --> 24:23.960
that he speaks to you in your dreams.

24:23.970 --> 24:27.499
How long have you been
having these visions?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.939
Had 'em for years.

24:30.940 --> 24:34.809
My spirit travels out of
me when I'm in a spell,

24:34.810 --> 24:38.079
searching for His voice.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.179
And when I hear it,

24:41.180 --> 24:42.919
He shows me the path,

24:42.920 --> 24:44.649
what I gotta do.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.949
And God told you to go on this raid

24:46.950 --> 24:48.359
even with the odds against you?

24:48.360 --> 24:51.120
There's two things I got a right to,

24:51.130 --> 24:54.729
and those are death or liberty.

24:54.730 --> 24:56.959
One or the other I means to have.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.299
You're not afraid?

24:58.300 --> 25:01.579
You're a fool if you ain't.

25:01.580 --> 25:06.169
But I'll stick my rifle right
in fear's ugly face anyway.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.579
Come on, now.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.279
It's getting dark.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.779
Time for us to go join your friend.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.629
You come to me without official orders,

25:30.630 --> 25:32.999
no identification of any kind,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.430
one of you with an accent
I can't quite place,

25:35.440 --> 25:37.239
and expect me to send my regiment back

25:37.240 --> 25:38.739
to where we narrowly escaped death

25:38.740 --> 25:41.339
after being ambushed by a
Confederate cavalry unit?

25:41.340 --> 25:43.539
Well, you don't have to
be so glass-half-empty.

25:43.540 --> 25:44.839
Who the hell are you people?

25:44.840 --> 25:46.759
- We are Union spies.
- With no papers?

25:46.760 --> 25:48.209
Because we are spies.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.179
Colonel Montgomery, sir,

25:50.180 --> 25:51.680
Harriet Tubman and her men

25:51.690 --> 25:53.509
are risking their lives for this raid.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.870
My regiment's been
ordered to Port Hudson

25:54.880 --> 25:56.040
first thing tomorrow.

25:56.050 --> 25:57.119
You change that order,

25:57.120 --> 25:58.409
I'll change that plan, otherwise...

25:58.410 --> 25:59.920
Harriet Tubman needs you.

25:59.930 --> 26:01.330
And the Union needs her.

26:03.050 --> 26:05.260
There are more than 750 slaves working

26:05.270 --> 26:06.899
on the river plantation
who are willing to fight.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.189
You are going to need those men

26:08.190 --> 26:09.850
at Fort Wagner,
Vicksburg, and Petersburg.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.439
Who are you, Miss, to
speak to me this way?

26:12.440 --> 26:14.799
I'm someone who knows what
the hell she's talking about.

26:31.490 --> 26:32.789
Take your hat, sir?

26:32.790 --> 26:34.990
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

26:49.420 --> 26:50.720
Damn the abolitionists.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.149
Welcome.

26:55.150 --> 26:57.110
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.949
Rhett Butler.

26:59.950 --> 27:03.719
Visiting from my plantation in Georgia.

27:03.720 --> 27:07.459
Hey, Mama. I'm coming now.

27:10.900 --> 27:12.500
Come on, baby.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.269
- Evening, Ms. Tubman.
- Evening, Ms. Tubman.

27:17.270 --> 27:19.529
Nancy, go and tell the
others it's time to go.

27:19.530 --> 27:21.149
We going to the boats on the water?

27:21.150 --> 27:23.009
No, we're walking to Port Royal.

27:23.010 --> 27:25.279
Isaiah, this is my new friend, Rufus.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.500
Come from up north to
help us fight the Rebs.

27:27.510 --> 27:29.009
What's going on in the house tonight?

27:29.010 --> 27:30.879
Some kind of occasion,
I don't know what for.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.879
That's what Rufus is aiming to find out.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.919
Can you sneak him in as a house slave?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.999
He's gonna need some clothes.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.220
You're just a tiny
little thing, ain't you?

27:39.230 --> 27:40.789
And now I'm back in junior high.

27:40.790 --> 27:43.259
I'll get the children out
safe and gather up the others.

27:43.260 --> 27:45.330
We'll wait for your
signal as long as we can.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.169
It's gonna be okay.

27:49.170 --> 27:51.669
We're getting you out of here for good.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.369
These were my brother's.

27:55.370 --> 27:57.270
He was tiny like you.

27:57.280 --> 28:00.540
- Called him Chipmunk.
- Yeah, no, I get it.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.049
We swept through that Yankee camp

28:04.050 --> 28:05.749
like a swarm of angry hornets,

28:05.750 --> 28:07.649
cutting down every man standing.

28:07.650 --> 28:09.599
Even one man sitting.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.299
Caught doing his business in the bush.

28:13.590 --> 28:15.520
Now, how did you all know that

28:15.530 --> 28:17.229
that Union camp was even there?

28:17.230 --> 28:19.290
Intelligence from one of our top men.

28:19.300 --> 28:21.099
Colonel Ryerson.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.269
Just seems to know
things no one else knows.

28:23.270 --> 28:26.099
- Hmm.
- I'll bet.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.399
I mean, I do declare.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.379
Hmm.

28:41.470 --> 28:45.469
Uh, gentlemen, if you
all will excuse me.

28:45.470 --> 28:47.359
So are your visions of the future,

28:47.360 --> 28:51.029
or, like, what's gonna happen
in the past in the future?

28:51.030 --> 28:54.199
- If you know what I mean.
- I do.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.770
You and I,

28:56.780 --> 28:59.709
we can time travel.

28:59.710 --> 29:03.139
Without the machine.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.930
Like Joan of Arc,

29:04.940 --> 29:06.609
Florence Nightingale,

29:06.610 --> 29:08.039
Kirk Cameron.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.449
We've been given a gift

29:10.450 --> 29:12.410
from God.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.279
They're scared of us.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.970
That's why they have me here.

29:15.980 --> 29:17.149
No, Stanley,

29:17.150 --> 29:19.619
you're here because you
won't look after yourself.

29:19.620 --> 29:22.059
At my expense, I might add.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.649
Look, something bad is gonna
happen to someone I care about,

29:24.650 --> 29:26.490
and I need to stop it.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.399
But the vision comes in...

29:29.400 --> 29:30.429
pieces.

29:30.430 --> 29:31.800
Because you're fighting it.

29:33.570 --> 29:37.939
I once spent an entire week in 1912.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.979
It's like a dream you
don't wanna come out of.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.579
You need to let your mind

29:43.580 --> 29:46.779
relax.

29:46.780 --> 29:49.819
Let yourself go on the mental trip.

29:49.820 --> 29:51.349
How do I do that?

29:51.350 --> 29:54.419
Do you have access to a
sensory deprivation tank?

29:55.930 --> 29:58.490
Sure, let me just
order one from SkyMall.

30:00.930 --> 30:03.760
Um, no, I don't.

30:03.770 --> 30:06.830
You need to find a very quiet place

30:06.840 --> 30:09.839
so you can focus on the vision.

30:09.840 --> 30:13.609
Then, after a while...

30:15.380 --> 30:18.009
You'll get better at...

30:18.010 --> 30:20.410
At falling into them.

30:20.420 --> 30:23.019
Like this.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.159
All right, show's over.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.659
No, no, no, no, no,
I have more questions.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.729
Now, he could be in this
catatonic state for days.

30:35.730 --> 30:37.160
This is why I didn't
want you to see him.

30:37.170 --> 30:39.639
You do not wanna end up like this.

30:39.640 --> 30:40.939
Do you?

30:40.940 --> 30:44.510
Come on.

30:51.580 --> 30:55.049
I'm so sorry, old friend.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.489
Hey, you.

31:01.490 --> 31:04.640
Let me have one of those drinks.

31:10.740 --> 31:12.319
That's the accent you're going with?

31:12.320 --> 31:13.429
Why? What's wrong with that?

31:13.430 --> 31:14.830
Nothing, if you're Keanu Reeves

31:14.840 --> 31:15.969
in "Devil's Advocate."

31:15.970 --> 31:17.199
You watch way too many movies.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.230
What'd you find out?

31:18.240 --> 31:19.939
The Confederate officer
in the other room,

31:19.940 --> 31:22.419
he had a sudden, and damn
near magical knowledge

31:22.420 --> 31:23.649
where the Union camp was.

31:23.650 --> 31:25.990
- He's a Sleeper Agent.
- Right.

31:40.630 --> 31:42.529
Is Harriet gonna wait for
Flynn and Lucy to get back?

31:42.530 --> 31:44.399
Well, she said she'd
wait as long as she could.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.029
We got runners!

31:46.030 --> 31:48.030
Which is apparently not very long.

31:50.500 --> 31:53.039
Awful late for a walk, ain't it?

31:53.040 --> 31:55.370
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

32:04.550 --> 32:07.319
You know what we do to
runaways around here, don't you?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.719
Age don't matter.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.359
We gotta teach you all your place.

32:18.300 --> 32:21.369
Wanna tell me my place again?

32:21.370 --> 32:24.269
- Come on.
- Let's get on, now.

32:24.270 --> 32:25.739
Maybe it's Lucy with our backup?

32:25.740 --> 32:28.430
Right. When have things ever, ever

32:28.440 --> 32:30.839
gone that well for us?

32:33.480 --> 32:35.649
Wyatt? They're Union spies.

32:35.650 --> 32:37.340
- Down.
- Kill them.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.120
You're outgunned, pal.

32:54.130 --> 32:57.199
That's a Colt Army Model,
44-caliber, six-shot.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.849
I got a Glock 9mm.

32:58.850 --> 33:00.209
Three extra clips in my pocket.

33:00.210 --> 33:01.839
I can do this all damn night.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.509
But you,

33:03.510 --> 33:08.049
by my count, have one shot left.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.919
All it takes is one.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.089
I just want my bag.

33:18.090 --> 33:20.289
You give it to me

33:20.290 --> 33:21.529
and she lives.

33:21.530 --> 33:24.659
Hey, David Duke. Looking for this?

33:27.900 --> 33:31.269
- Just toss it to me.
- Sure, no problem.

33:31.270 --> 33:32.869
Catch.

33:32.870 --> 33:35.209
No!

33:35.210 --> 33:38.139
Don't move. Don't
move, or I'll shoot her.

33:38.140 --> 33:41.540
Do not move, or she dies.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.449
Ah!

33:48.320 --> 33:49.850
I quit, by the way.

34:29.739 --> 34:32.389
Word is, all them
plantation folks up river

34:32.389 --> 34:34.458
are running off.

34:34.460 --> 34:37.129
Lord, they scared of us now.

34:37.130 --> 34:38.610
Truth be told, I'm a little scared too.

34:38.620 --> 34:40.100
You are a total badass.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.330
What'd you call me?

34:41.340 --> 34:42.699
Uh, no, sorry.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.938
That is a compliment where I'm from.

34:44.940 --> 34:46.909
I still don't know where that is.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.909
Not anywhere close.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.279
When I saw you coming,

34:53.280 --> 34:55.719
during one of my spells,

34:55.820 --> 34:57.649
you were like angels,

34:57.650 --> 34:59.789
appearing out of nowhere,

34:59.790 --> 35:01.519
like you were sent straight from heaven.

35:05.030 --> 35:07.790
These visions you have,

35:07.800 --> 35:09.499
do they always come true?

35:09.500 --> 35:11.529
Not always.

35:11.530 --> 35:13.900
Sometimes they make no sense at all.

35:14.100 --> 35:16.999
Like, when you appeared out of nowhere,

35:17.000 --> 35:21.709
you were stepping out
of a giant metal ball.

35:21.710 --> 35:24.979
Go figure that one out.

35:24.980 --> 35:26.980
Well, I gotta go.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.949
My friends, the other Union spies,

35:29.950 --> 35:32.099
we have to check in with
our commanding officer.

35:35.790 --> 35:37.589
Can I just tell you

35:37.590 --> 35:40.960
what an honor it is to have met you.

35:41.260 --> 35:43.660
I wish I had some advice for you,

35:43.760 --> 35:45.299
about how to make money,

35:45.300 --> 35:46.429
something to make your life better,

35:46.430 --> 35:49.999
because if there is
anyone who deserves it,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.770
it's you.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.639
My only desire

35:55.640 --> 35:59.510
is to live free.

35:59.710 --> 36:01.450
The rest will work itself out.

36:21.310 --> 36:22.869
Looks like the Combahee River Raid

36:22.870 --> 36:25.339
is now the Willow Glen Plantation Raid.

36:25.340 --> 36:28.939
A decisive one for the
Union, led by Harriet Tubman.

36:28.940 --> 36:30.909
Hmm.

36:30.910 --> 36:32.709
I'm gonna go check on Jessica.

36:32.710 --> 36:36.610
Oh, uh, congratulations, by the way.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.319
Lucy gave me the news.

36:39.320 --> 36:43.590
You're gonna be a great father.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.739
Hey.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.710
So you told Flynn.

37:03.810 --> 37:06.640
It was a long ride to Port Royal.

37:06.950 --> 37:09.309
I mean, he was gonna find out
sooner or later, wasn't he?

37:09.310 --> 37:11.779
Yeah. Uh, whatever.

37:11.780 --> 37:13.649
Okay.

37:13.650 --> 37:15.319
Fine.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.989
We're good.

37:16.990 --> 37:18.789
Great.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.890
Should I be hearing something?

37:49.990 --> 37:51.850
Maybe a little indigestion.

37:57.230 --> 38:01.529
I had the weirdest interaction
with Agent Christopher today.

38:01.530 --> 38:03.730
What do you mean?

38:03.940 --> 38:05.770
Well, I told her I was pregnant,

38:05.970 --> 38:08.139
and then she said that I should leave

38:08.140 --> 38:10.409
for the health of the baby.

38:10.410 --> 38:12.210
You believe that?

38:16.380 --> 38:20.479
She wasn't supposed to talk
about that until I got back.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.149
You knew?

38:22.150 --> 38:25.289
She told you about this?

38:25.290 --> 38:26.689
Well, what did you say?

38:26.690 --> 38:28.320
I said if you go, I go.

38:28.330 --> 38:30.959
Good.

38:33.260 --> 38:36.199
Jess.

38:38.840 --> 38:41.970
But look, maybe...

38:42.270 --> 38:43.670
Maybe she has a point.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.799
What? Why?

38:44.800 --> 38:46.370
There's gonna be doctors' appointments,

38:46.380 --> 38:49.240
and... and Lamaze classes, right?

38:49.250 --> 38:52.080
And I want things to be normal for you.

38:52.180 --> 38:54.390
- And for our baby.
- But you won't be there.

38:54.490 --> 38:56.039
I will be. As often as I can.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.049
I'll check in all the time.

38:57.050 --> 38:59.219
You're the one who said it's
not safe for me out there.

38:59.220 --> 39:00.979
No, we'll keep security on you, 24/7.

39:00.980 --> 39:02.920
You're hiding something from me.

39:03.030 --> 39:05.189
- No, that's not true.
- It's me, Wyatt.

39:05.190 --> 39:06.840
I know when you're hiding something.

39:06.950 --> 39:09.629
You've spent our entire
marriage hiding things from me,

39:09.630 --> 39:13.970
and I told you I cannot be
married to a state secret.

39:14.070 --> 39:16.470
Please, please do not do this.

39:21.310 --> 39:23.810
I'm not keeping anything from you.

39:24.010 --> 39:25.610
I swear.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.389
Hey.

39:33.390 --> 39:35.359
I'm headed to bed. Long day.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.359
Cool, yeah, I... I'm just, uh,

39:37.360 --> 39:40.529
running a systems check to
see if everything's okay.

39:40.530 --> 39:43.800
Is everything okay? With you?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.730
Long day worrying about
you dying in the Civil War.

39:49.540 --> 39:53.470
I worry about you too.

39:53.580 --> 39:56.140
You know, Harriet Tubman had visions.

39:56.150 --> 39:59.750
She told me she saw us coming.

39:59.850 --> 40:02.119
Seemed to see the Lifeboat too.

40:02.120 --> 40:06.250
Swore up and down it was
coming from a higher power.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.520
God.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.959
Do you believe her?

40:11.960 --> 40:14.110
I'm not ready to go all
Pentecostal or anything,

40:14.120 --> 40:16.729
but maybe something was sending
her and you these visions

40:16.730 --> 40:19.169
for a reason, maybe we...

40:19.170 --> 40:21.969
I need to pay more attention.

40:21.970 --> 40:24.140
Yeah.

40:24.340 --> 40:27.010
Yeah, like if I can find a
way to see more of the vision,

40:27.020 --> 40:28.699
then maybe we can find a way to stop it.

40:28.700 --> 40:29.840
Exactly.

40:29.850 --> 40:32.249
If we can't run from it,
we'll run right into it.

40:32.250 --> 40:34.510
Sounds like a plan.

40:35.780 --> 40:38.819
Don't stay up too late.

40:51.830 --> 40:53.240
Okay. Okay.

41:51.130 --> 41:52.889
Jiya.

41:52.890 --> 41:55.029
Jiya, what're you doing?

41:55.030 --> 41:57.590
Stop. Don't come any closer.

42:00.830 --> 42:02.069
Jessica?

42:03.900 --> 42:07.069
What're you doing? What's going on here?

42:07.070 --> 42:08.640
I'm so sorry.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.940
Jessica!

42:43.610 --> 42:45.600
- Where's the "Lifeboat"?
- Where's Jiya?

42:45.700 --> 42:47.369
- What happened?
- Wyatt!

42:47.370 --> 42:50.240
It's Jessica, she...

42:50.440 --> 42:53.129
She got my gun. Kidnapped Jiya.

42:53.130 --> 42:54.929
- Took the "Lifeboat."
- She what?

42:54.930 --> 42:56.159
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.230
So... so Jessica is Rittenhouse?

42:58.240 --> 43:02.270
- Rittenhouse has the Lifeboat?
- What did she do with Jiya?

43:06.450 --> 43:08.370
- Anything, Rufus?
- No, nothing.

43:08.380 --> 43:09.399
I can't find them.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.820
They might've disabled the tracker.

43:10.830 --> 43:12.490
Is there another way to
locate the "Lifeboat"?

43:12.500 --> 43:14.199
The whole system is
down. There's nothing!

43:14.200 --> 43:17.740
Hey, hey, we will find her. All right?

43:17.840 --> 43:19.859
We asked you.

43:19.860 --> 43:23.119
I asked you to tell us if
she said or did anything

43:23.120 --> 43:24.450
to make you think she was Rittenhouse!

43:24.460 --> 43:25.410
He didn't do anything wrong.

43:25.411 --> 43:27.650
He didn't... he didn't suspect anything.

43:27.750 --> 43:30.080
I did.

43:30.190 --> 43:32.460
What?

43:32.470 --> 43:33.599
Her brother.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.030
He's a mechanic in Hayward.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.569
We did a background check
on him. It came out clean.

43:37.570 --> 43:40.840
Yes, but in our original timeline,

43:40.940 --> 43:42.809
he died of leukemia when they were kids.

43:42.810 --> 43:43.989
What?

43:43.990 --> 43:45.809
But here, Jessica said that he was saved

43:45.810 --> 43:48.650
by some sort of stem
cell therapy, which...

43:50.180 --> 43:52.549
I assume was not around in the 1980s.

43:52.550 --> 43:54.349
So what? You just lied?

43:54.350 --> 43:55.390
Why didn't you tell us?

43:55.400 --> 43:57.310
Because I wanted to figure it out first.

43:57.410 --> 43:59.379
I told her she had to leave the bunker.

43:59.380 --> 44:01.480
I was trying to do
the right thing, and...

44:01.680 --> 44:03.359
if your sister came back,

44:03.360 --> 44:04.779
would you assume that
she was your sister,

44:04.780 --> 44:08.020
or would you think she's
some sort of a traitor?

44:13.730 --> 44:15.039
I'm sorry.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.570
It's a little late for that.

44:17.580 --> 44:20.090
Geez, we-we had those Rittenhouse photos

44:20.100 --> 44:22.479
and we did jack squat,
and now Jiya's gone.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.749
There's photos? No
one told me about that.

44:24.750 --> 44:27.090
'Cause no one trusted that
you wouldn't try to kill her.

44:27.290 --> 44:28.819
Well, in hindsight, would that have

44:28.820 --> 44:30.620
- been so bad?
- Watch your mouth.

44:30.630 --> 44:31.659
Okay, we're just trying to figure out

44:31.660 --> 44:33.809
- what happened, Wyatt.
- Let me just sum this up.

44:33.810 --> 44:36.170
Jessica was screwing you,
she lied about being pregnant,

44:36.270 --> 44:37.889
and then she wrapped
you around her finger

44:37.890 --> 44:39.959
just long enough so
she could screw us too!

44:39.960 --> 44:41.460
- Guys, come on!
- Wyatt, stand down!

44:41.470 --> 44:42.590
Wyatt!

44:44.400 --> 44:47.920
Wyatt!

44:48.020 --> 44:49.920
- Lucy.
- No, no.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.830
I'm guessing that's not a One A Day?

45:12.930 --> 45:14.640
Something to help you sleep.

45:14.650 --> 45:18.299
You've got a lot to learn,
and we need you well-rested.

45:18.300 --> 45:21.730
Come on, Jessica. We're friends.

45:21.930 --> 45:24.859
We watched an entire season
of "Vanderpump Rules" together.

45:24.860 --> 45:26.309
They won't hurt you,
Jiya, just cooperate.

45:26.310 --> 45:27.709
Take it.

45:29.210 --> 45:31.860
Or Doug will make you.

45:32.060 --> 45:33.999
Every terrible thing Lucy said about you

45:34.000 --> 45:37.019
doesn't even begin to capture
what a raging psycho you are.

45:41.990 --> 45:44.329
Open.

45:52.280 --> 45:53.639
Rest now.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.279
You've got a lot of work ahead.

46:04.950 --> 46:09.390
To Jessica and the capture
of their time machine.

46:09.490 --> 46:10.729
It's total victory.

46:10.730 --> 46:13.300
We can accelerate our plans now.

46:13.500 --> 46:15.469
Expand our actions.

46:15.470 --> 46:18.800
- How's my daughter?
- Stubborn. Strong-willed.

46:18.810 --> 46:21.210
I can see where she gets it.

46:21.310 --> 46:23.630
And she's in love with
Wyatt, I can tell you that.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.970
Mm, her taste in men.

46:25.980 --> 46:27.540
That's my husband you're talking about.

46:27.550 --> 46:28.869
No offense.

46:28.870 --> 46:30.739
What's this?

46:30.740 --> 46:32.470
Emma.

46:32.480 --> 46:34.480
Isn't it amazing?

46:34.580 --> 46:36.440
Jessica brought us the "Lifeboat."

46:36.450 --> 46:39.479
Along with one of their pilots, Jiya.

46:39.480 --> 46:42.480
Great. Want me to kill her?

46:42.690 --> 46:44.319
Why would we have you kill her?

46:44.320 --> 46:46.450
Like Jessica just said, she's a pilot.

46:46.460 --> 46:49.889
So now we have a backup in
case something happens to you.

46:52.550 --> 46:54.759
I thought Jessica was
supposed to gather intel,

46:54.760 --> 46:58.170
then take them all out when the
opportunity presented itself.

46:58.270 --> 47:00.399
Not commit grand theft auto.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.200
Well, this is better, isn't it?

47:02.210 --> 47:05.170
Now we have both machines,
and they have none.

47:05.180 --> 47:07.510
Why wasn't I consulted?

47:07.610 --> 47:09.240
Should we have?

47:10.880 --> 47:13.349
I thought you relied on my advice.

47:13.350 --> 47:16.089
Of course I do. Don't be cross.

47:17.790 --> 47:20.250
Look, I know that the two of you

47:20.260 --> 47:23.620
are, what, dating, I suppose?

47:23.630 --> 47:27.499
And that Nicholas holds
you in the highest regard.

47:27.500 --> 47:31.130
But we visited some of
our ancestors last week.

47:31.330 --> 47:36.900
And it reminded us that
Rittenhouse is blood.

47:36.910 --> 47:41.110
It's heritage. Legacy.

47:41.210 --> 47:43.940
But don't get me wrong, we do appreciate

47:43.950 --> 47:46.249
all the help you've given us.

47:46.250 --> 47:48.619
So thank you.

47:48.620 --> 47:50.919
Yeah, of course.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.319
You're welcome.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.300
Rufus, I'm so sorry.

48:14.940 --> 48:17.009
I don't wanna hear "sorry."

48:17.010 --> 48:19.050
I wanna hear you fix this.

48:21.480 --> 48:23.050
I will.

48:26.850 --> 48:29.289
You are so worried about your stupid

48:29.290 --> 48:31.089
Lucy-Jessica soap opera that you forgot

48:31.090 --> 48:33.729
that there are other people here.

48:33.730 --> 48:35.600
Who matter to each other.

48:35.810 --> 48:37.870
Who love each other.

48:44.310 --> 48:46.750
If anything happens to her, Wyatt...

48:48.620 --> 48:50.850
I don't think I can ever forgive you.

49:09.020 --> 49:12.569
Couldn't pass out on the bed?

49:12.570 --> 49:14.469
Huh?

49:14.470 --> 49:15.699
Okay.

49:44.600 --> 49:45.760
I'm sorry.

49:45.770 --> 49:48.699
I'm so sorry.

50:07.740 --> 50:09.000
Stop!

50:28.840 --> 50:30.109
Connor.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.260
What is that?

50:34.050 --> 50:36.400
Oh, my God. It's the "Lifeboat."

50:36.410 --> 50:38.069
It's back online!

50:38.070 --> 50:41.019
Jiya's escaped. She's coming back!

50:45.160 --> 50:46.259
She's here!

50:53.800 --> 50:56.899
What happened? Where is she?

50:59.140 --> 51:01.109
"Lifeboat" is gone. She
didn't stick the landing.

51:01.110 --> 51:02.509
What do you mean? Where is she?

51:02.510 --> 51:04.710
We don't know.

51:06.650 --> 51:08.280
She's lost in time.

51:14.310 --> 51:16.209
Now, we don't know anything for certain,

51:16.210 --> 51:21.369
but we think, we hope, Jiya
escaped from Rittenhouse

51:21.370 --> 51:23.969
and was trying to get home,
but she didn't make it.

51:23.970 --> 51:26.240
- Why?
- I don't know. Piloting error?

51:26.340 --> 51:28.279
- She's better than that.
- Maybe there's damage to the...

51:28.280 --> 51:30.540
The "Lifeboat." Regardless...

51:30.750 --> 51:33.910
there's a very good chance
that Jiya is alive in the past.

51:33.920 --> 51:36.219
And if she is, she knows what to do.

51:36.220 --> 51:37.980
She'll find a way to
communicate with us.

51:37.990 --> 51:39.619
- How?
- Through history.

51:39.620 --> 51:42.959
Newspapers, advertisements,
large public events.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.759
Somewhere where she might show her face.

51:44.760 --> 51:47.829
It's why Rufus is running a
facial
