CHRIS ROCK:
After another whole year
at Corleone,

00:06.640 --> 00:09.743
it was good to finally get
to the last week of school.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.780
Summer vacation was ahead of
me, and the days of being

00:12.813 --> 00:16.384
bullied by Caruso on a daily
basiswere behind me.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.618
Man, I can't wait.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.720
No more tests,
no more bus rides.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.721
Hold on.

00:20.754 --> 00:21.722
There.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.324
2,100 minutes.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.325
What?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.559
There are 2,100 minutes left

00:25.593 --> 00:27.428
until the end
of the school year.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.496
Don't you mean five days?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.064
I prefer 2,100 minutes.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.099
It sounds like less time.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.766
Whatever.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.103
What's wrong with you?
Remember at the beginning
of the school year

00:35.136 --> 00:37.538
when I said I wanted things
to be different and all that?

00:37.571 --> 00:38.739
Yeah, what about it?

00:38.772 --> 00:40.808
Well, everything I didn't
want to have happen happened.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.576
It hasn't been all bad.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.777
You were elected
student president.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.079
I was impeached.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.280
Keep it up.

00:46.314 --> 00:49.083
You're gonna make this week a
lot longer than it has to be.

00:49.117 --> 00:51.219
I just want to do one thing
before the end of the year

00:51.252 --> 00:52.253
that I feel good about.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.187
Hey, T.C.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.523
Five more days
till you're back in the hood.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.524
Dropped something.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.526
Don't you ever get tired
of that?

00:58.559 --> 01:01.195
I never get tired,
it never gets old.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.333
You know, I think I know how
to make this all worthwhile.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.235
What are you talking about?

01:07.268 --> 01:08.769
I'm gonna get my
revenge on Caruso.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.071
Stay tuned
for Revenge of the Nerd.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.207
The hardest thing
about planning revenge

01:46.240 --> 01:47.741
is figuring out how far to go.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.278
How's Operation Get Revenge
On Caruso going?

01:50.311 --> 01:51.912
Not bad, but I'm changing
the operation name

01:51.945 --> 01:53.414
to He Can Hear
You, Stupid.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.249
What's that?

01:55.283 --> 01:56.484
It's my revenge list.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.652
I'm trying to figure out
the best way to do it.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.154
You could toilet paper
his house.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.222
Too dangerous.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.523
You could egg him
on the way home.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.424
Too obvious.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.193
You could put Ex-Lax
in his hot chocolate.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.395
Too typical.
Suit yourself,

02:07.428 --> 02:10.231
but I'm saving that one
for a jerk to be named later.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.432
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

02:11.465 --> 02:14.235
I want to show Caruso that
he can't keep messing with me

02:14.268 --> 02:14.868
and get away with it.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.270
I'm gonna get him back.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.272
I'm gonna get
him back good.

02:18.306 --> 02:21.609
Like Tina finally did to Ike.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.444
While I was making up
for the past,

02:23.477 --> 02:26.580
Drew was getting ready
for his future.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.915
Oh!

02:27.948 --> 02:30.784
Look at you.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.521
Oh, my baby's
graduating.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.956
I think the hat
looks stupid.
Shut up.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.292
You shut up.
Hey, hey, be quiet.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.894
Hey, Mom, can we eat
at Junior's after graduation?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.196
TONYA:
I hate Junior's.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.897
Can we eat
at Sylvia's?

02:43.931 --> 02:44.965
Drew gets to pick.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.235
He's the one graduating,
Tonya.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.536
You know what?

02:48.569 --> 02:50.904
In that case, Ma, we
have to go to Sylvia's.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.873
Oh, that's nice, baby.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.209
To tell Sylvia we're
eating at Junior's.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.278
Ow!
Well, we can ask
your daddy.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.912
I'm sure we can eat
wherever you want.

02:58.946 --> 02:59.913
As long as they have

02:59.947 --> 03:02.683
a "Kids eat free
after 4:00 p.m." special.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.653
I don't know what's
so special about graduating.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.854
Nothing,
if you're happy saying,

03:06.887 --> 03:07.788
"May I take your order,
please?"

03:07.821 --> 03:10.324
What's so special is:
I don't have to go

03:10.358 --> 03:11.859
to little kid school
with you anymore.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.227
I'm grown.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.463
Well, you're not grown;
you're stupid.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.797
You're stupid.
You're stupid.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.865
Hey, hey, hey.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.400
Didn't I say "Stop"?

03:19.433 --> 03:22.636
Hey, Ma, can I show the
guys my cap and gown?

03:22.670 --> 03:23.904
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

03:23.937 --> 03:25.005
You ain't gonna mess
that gown up,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.308
and then go walking
across the stage looking like

03:27.341 --> 03:28.609
"Who did that to you?"

03:28.642 --> 03:30.010
Take it off.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.512
And give me
the hat, too.

03:32.913 --> 03:33.981
I'm gonna hang this
in your closet,

03:34.014 --> 03:36.016
and I better not see you
in it until graduation day.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.985
You understand me?
Yes, ma'am.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.787
Huh, excuse me?
I di... what?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.255
Yes, ma'am.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.723
All right.

03:44.858 --> 03:48.028
While Drew was moving up, Mr.
Omar's drain was stopped up.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.030
How long has it
been like that?

03:50.063 --> 03:52.500
Ever since it got back
from vacation in Haiti.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.467
I don't know.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.437
Some time overnight,
it just got all backed up.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.340
Hmm... I'll take care of it.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.541
My father thought

04:00.574 --> 04:03.644
he could fix anything
with Crazy Glue or duct tape.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.645
What you doing?

04:04.678 --> 04:06.314
Fixing the table.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.815
All done.

04:07.848 --> 04:08.949
Look at that.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.017
Julius.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.852
Did you fix
that flat tire?

04:11.885 --> 04:14.288
:
Good as new.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.859
Did you fix
that noise yet?

04:18.892 --> 04:20.494
Quiet as a mouse.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.998
Here, hold this for me.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.969
I don't think duct tape
is gonna fix that, Mr. Julius.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.738
Why don't you just call
the plumber?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.005
For $25 an hour?

04:32.039 --> 04:34.975
I don't think so.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.043
I know what to do.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.582
In order
to exact the perfect revenge,

04:41.615 --> 04:44.017
I decided I should consult
some experts.

04:44.051 --> 04:47.488
If I was you, I'd move onto his
block and take a dollar from him

04:47.521 --> 04:50.090
every day
for the rest of his life.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.191
Let me hold a dollar.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.861
You could slash his tires,
pour sugar in his gas tank,

04:53.894 --> 04:57.331
put bleach on his clothes,
give his wife a bad perm.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.032
Revenge?

04:59.066 --> 05:03.604
Success... the best revenge.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.905
My mother didn't say

05:04.938 --> 05:07.040
Drew couldn't wear
his graduation gown.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.043
She just said she didn't want
to see him wearing it.

05:10.077 --> 05:14.782
So when she wasn't around,
he watched TV in it...

05:14.815 --> 05:16.584
he played sports in it...

05:16.617 --> 05:19.353
Get it!
All right, man,
yeah, go, go, go, go!

05:19.387 --> 05:21.955
He got ready for school
in it...

05:21.989 --> 05:24.725
he even practiced graduating
from another school in it.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.633
With only four days
of school left to get Caruso,

05:32.666 --> 05:36.404
I needed a crazy revenge plan,
so I asked a crazy person.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.472
Hey, you know anything
about revenge?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.108
One time in this
third world country,

05:41.141 --> 05:42.810
I helped install
this puppet regime

05:42.843 --> 05:45.078
for this dictator's
ex-wife after a coup,

05:45.112 --> 05:46.113
just so she
could stop him

05:46.146 --> 05:47.615
from getting his
favorite suits.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.149
So that's a yes?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.484
I don't know what
you're talking about.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.720
Okay...

05:52.753 --> 05:54.455
Well, there's
this kid Caruso.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.089
He's been picking on me
all year long

05:56.123 --> 05:57.157
and I just want
to get even.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.993
You want to know how to do
it? If he pulls a knife,

06:00.027 --> 06:00.861
you pull a gun.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.763
He sends one of yours
to the hospital,

06:02.796 --> 06:04.031
you send his
to the morgue.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.734
Now, you do that, and that will
end your problems with Caruso.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.702
Crips and Bloods tried that.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.937
Never quite seemed to work out.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.406
I just want him
to stop picking on me.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.741
Okay, well, what do
you know about him?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.142
Well, he likes
to beat me up.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.044
What else?
Call me names.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.412
Is that all you know about him?

06:18.446 --> 06:19.413
Pretty much.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.280
Well, then, that's your problem.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.950
First rule of combat:
know your enemy.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.186
Man, revenge is like a good
pair of night vision goggles.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.821
If they're not
made just for you,

06:27.855 --> 06:29.457
they're never going to
work, and you're going

06:29.490 --> 06:31.525
to wind up shooting your
platoon leader in the neck

06:31.559 --> 06:32.960
by accident.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.996
Now, if you want to get this
revenge on this Caruso,

06:36.029 --> 06:40.067
you got to study him--
you got to find out his
strengths and weaknesses.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.671
You got to design something
especially for him.

06:43.704 --> 06:47.808
Remember this: revenge is
a dish best served cold.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.942
I thought that was meatloaf.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.110
Thanks.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.647
So now the plan was
Operation Get To Know Caruso.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.687
My mission with Caruso was
simple:

06:59.720 --> 07:02.089
find out things
without getting found out.

07:02.122 --> 07:06.126
(A Flock of Seagulls'
"I Ran" playing)

07:06.960 --> 07:08.762
What happened?
Did he spot us?

07:08.796 --> 07:11.499
No, but only because he didn't
see us behind that mustache.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.201
How are you going to follow
someone with a fake mustache

07:14.234 --> 07:16.470
and a Hawaiian shirt and
expect them not to notice you?

07:16.504 --> 07:17.971
Works for Magnum, P.I.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.708
Number one, Tom Selleck
is a 45-year-old man.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.743
Two, he wears Hawaiian
shirts in Hawaii.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.877
There, they're
just shirts.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.113
It's like Chinese
food in China.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.215
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.551
There's Mandarin,
Cantonese, Szechuan,

07:30.584 --> 07:32.853
my favorite, Hunan,
Shanghai...

07:36.524 --> 07:38.058
What's he doing?

07:38.091 --> 07:39.693
Looks like he's waiting
for somebody.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.763
What time is it?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.698
3:15.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.999
He's waiting for me.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.035
Hey, you seen Chris?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.036
Nuh-uh.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.771
* And I ran, I ran so...

07:50.804 --> 07:52.272
He's warming up.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.174
He's leaving.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.076
* I just ran

07:56.109 --> 07:57.778
* I ran all night and day.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.547
You okay?

07:59.580 --> 08:01.549
Hey, are you Chris?

08:01.582 --> 08:02.950
Yeah.
Next time,

08:02.983 --> 08:05.052
be on time.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.319
If nothing else,

08:06.353 --> 08:10.791
at least I learned to use a
different door to leave school.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.294
Back at home, Drew's graduation
was gradually getting to Tonya.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.030
:
Why don't you take
that stupid cap and gown off?

08:17.064 --> 08:18.699
You know Momma said
not to wear it.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.935
: You're just jealous
because I look so cool.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.303
You don't look cool;
you look stupid.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.738
You're the one
that's gonna look stupid

08:24.772 --> 08:25.806
in your little baby school.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.541
I'm not a baby; you're a baby.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.209
That's why this baby
is graduating.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.048
:
Clean it up.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.052
Ha, now you clean it up.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.220
Drew.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.589
Everybody quiet.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.324
I want to hear
Drew's last words.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.627
Go take that gown off.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.300
Clean this mess up.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.637
If that was me,
I'd be cleaning my teeth up.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.705
Meanwhile, my father tried

08:57.738 --> 09:00.708
to replace a $25-an-hour
plumber

09:00.741 --> 09:02.943
with a 14 cents-an-ounce
bottle.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.344
Drainada?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.345
That's right.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.279
It's Spanish Drano.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.315
Doesn't "Drano"
already sound Spanish?

09:08.348 --> 09:09.983
It's just as good
as the real thing.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.586
What's in it?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.888
Sodium hydroxide
and hot sauce.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.924
It dissolves the clog
and leaves the pipes

09:16.957 --> 09:18.191
with a fresh, spicy scent.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.226
See?

09:20.260 --> 09:22.262
Does it work?

09:22.295 --> 09:24.732
You ever heard of a Puerto
Rican with a plugged

09:24.765 --> 09:25.733
No.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.734
Okay.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.235
It's just hitting Mr. Omar

09:28.268 --> 09:36.777
that maybe he did know a Puerto
Rican with a plugged-up sink.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.212
Back on the street,
something else was going down.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.513
This is boring, man.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.651
If this were Magnum, it'd be
a good time for a car chase.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.694
You satisfied?

09:54.695 --> 09:55.929
Greg, stop!

09:55.963 --> 09:58.699
Greg just set a record in
the 100-meter run-like-a-girl.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.986
I'd been following Caruso
all day

10:19.019 --> 10:20.888
and I had come to a conclusion.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.223
Bullies are strange people.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.668
Thanks for taking care
of her for me.

10:34.702 --> 10:35.869
WOMAN:
You're welcome.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.237
He's a cat lover?

10:37.270 --> 10:38.906
It was like finding out

10:38.939 --> 10:41.441
that Saddam Hussein collected
Cabbage Patch Kids.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.043
CARUSO:
Who's a good kitty?

10:43.076 --> 10:45.679
I love you. Yes, I do.

10:45.713 --> 10:46.747
You curious, kitty?

10:46.780 --> 10:49.182
I love you. You
want to go home?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.450
See your
new mommy?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.921
I figured that with Caruso,
this pet would be all white.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.956
Let's go home and
meet your new mommy.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.728
Yes.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.263
While I was on Caruso's tail,

11:03.296 --> 11:05.465
my mother was about
to get on Drew's behind.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.901
Why did I tell you not
to wear this gown?

11:07.935 --> 11:10.270
'Cause I'd mess it up.
And what happened?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.472
I messed it up.
I tried to
tell him...

11:12.505 --> 11:13.306
ROCHELLE:
Girl, when I'm ready

11:13.340 --> 11:15.743
to talk to you,
I will let you know.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.211
What am I supposed
to do with this, Drew?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.080
Can you fix it?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.248
Can you fix it?

11:21.281 --> 11:22.382
I shouldn't have to fix it.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.719
That's why I told you not
to wear it in the first place.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.486
And back to you.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.620
What in the world

11:27.654 --> 11:29.923
would possess you to throw
ice cream on your brother?

11:29.957 --> 11:32.960
Because he's always teasing me
because he's graduating,

11:32.993 --> 11:34.294
and I'm not.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.462
I'm sick of him.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.965
Baby, it's just his turn.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.833
One day, you're
gonna graduate,

11:39.867 --> 11:42.502
and if your father has
anything to do with it,

11:42.535 --> 11:45.072
you will be getting
on everybody's nerves.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.139
Trust me.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.942
But baby, until then, you
just have to be patient.

11:48.976 --> 11:52.746
But when Drew leaves Dolemite,
who's gonna walk me to school?

11:52.780 --> 11:55.382
Even though Tonya was a menace
to society,

11:55.415 --> 11:57.751
she was still a little girl
at heart.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.086
I will, Tonya.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.520
I'm only going to Sanford.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.089
I can still walk you.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.024
You will?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.392
Yeah.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.028
I think you owe your
brother an apology.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.529
I'm sorry.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.933
And I think you owe
your sister an apology.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.968
Don't look at me like that.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.436
I'm sorry for teasing you.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.805
ROCHELLE:
Okay.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.807
So now that
you're sorry,

12:19.840 --> 12:23.510
and you're sorry,
I'm gonna be sorry, too.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.813
Oh, yeah, take it upstairs.

12:25.846 --> 12:26.847
That day, my mother performed

12:26.880 --> 12:30.250
Bed-Stuy's first
synchronized behind beating.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.252
Mr. Omar's drain
was still clogged,

12:32.285 --> 12:34.287
so my father
kept plugging away.

12:34.321 --> 12:38.058
Don't you think you ought
to call a plumber?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.160
I told you,
I don't need a plumber.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.461
Not when I got this.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.831
"Custodian in a Conga"?

12:43.864 --> 12:44.965
Yeah, Custodian in a Conga.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.067
I mean, it's like
Janitor in a Drum,

12:47.100 --> 12:50.403
only it's 30% stronger,
and 20% less.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.473
Well, it better work 30% faster,
'cause I need my sink.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.542
Watch this.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.581
Some day, Al Gore is gonna
trace global warming

13:01.614 --> 13:03.817
back to that sink.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.018
Finding out

13:05.052 --> 13:06.854
that Caruso loved cats
was one thing.

13:06.887 --> 13:10.157
Finding out how to use it
against him was something else.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.225
Maybe you could kidnap
one of his cats,

13:12.259 --> 13:14.828
hold him for ransom, and when
he doesn't send the money,

13:14.862 --> 13:16.529
you could cut off one
of the cat's ears,

13:16.563 --> 13:18.531
send it to him
in a plain brown wrapper

13:18.565 --> 13:20.033
just to let him know
you're serious.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.601
At that moment, I was happy

13:21.634 --> 13:23.536
that I'd always been nice
to Greg.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.838
What the heck is this?

13:24.872 --> 13:26.073
Banacek.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.374
I'm mixing it up.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.575
I don't know, man.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.377
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.311
What are you talking about?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.246
I just wish Caruso
would leave me alone,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.248
and I feel like if
I get my revenge,

13:35.282 --> 13:36.850
I'll be no
better than him.

13:36.884 --> 13:37.617
Yeah, I guess you're right.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.252
You should be the bigger man.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.253
You should just forget

13:40.287 --> 13:42.455
about that time
he hit you with paint balloons.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.524
Or about the time
he egged you on Halloween.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.060
Or the time he stole
your picture day clothes.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.930
Go ahead, let the cycle
of violence continue.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.531
You know what they say.

13:51.564 --> 13:52.632
What do they say?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.334
All it takes for evil to prevail

13:54.367 --> 13:57.270
is for a few good men
to do nothing.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.172
Out of my way,
Count Chocula.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.540
I got places to be.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.175
You're a better man than me.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.212
Oh, we'll see about that.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.484
Since my father
hadn't fixed the sink,

14:11.518 --> 14:12.986
Mr. Omar decided to fix him.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.587
Slumlord?!
What?

14:14.621 --> 14:18.125
Mr. Omar contacted
the Housing Authority

14:18.158 --> 14:20.627
and said that we're refusing
to maintain the apartment.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.595
You should call
the Housing Authority

14:22.629 --> 14:24.431
about his
blacklight panther poster.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.666
Well, Julius,
you got two choices.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.368
Either call a lawyer,

14:28.401 --> 14:29.569
or call a
plumber.

14:29.602 --> 14:33.907
Good thing they don't sell
Johnnie Cochran in a Can.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.376
On the next-to-last day
of school, I felt like

14:36.409 --> 14:39.246
I was about to get on
with the rest of my life

14:39.279 --> 14:40.480
without being bothered
by Caruso.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.649
So, you figured out
what we're gonna do yet?

14:42.682 --> 14:43.683
Yup.
Cool.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.118
So when do we start?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.586
It's not we this time, Greg.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.321
I have to do this by myself.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.958
If something goes wrong, I can't
have you getting in trouble.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.526
This is just like Doughboy
and Tré in Boys 'n the Hood.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.528
You don't have to do that.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.230
We're in this together.
Not this time.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.299
If you say so.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.334
So, what are you gonna do?

15:01.368 --> 15:04.071
If I tell you,
I have to kill you.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.272
You're joking, right?

15:05.305 --> 15:06.473
No.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.975
Not even a little.

15:11.178 --> 15:14.714
The best part about my revenge
was that Caruso would pay,

15:14.747 --> 15:16.716
and nobody would get hurt.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.987
(Public Enemy's "Welcome to
the Terrordome" plays)

15:22.089 --> 15:25.692
* This is a journey

15:25.725 --> 15:28.962
* I got so much trouble
on my mind *

15:28.996 --> 15:30.397
* Refuse to lose

15:30.430 --> 15:33.033
* Here's your ticket

15:33.066 --> 15:34.968
* Hear the drummer get wicked

15:35.002 --> 15:37.370
* The crew to you to push the
back to Black attack *

15:37.404 --> 15:39.272
* So I sat...
then slapped the Mac *

15:39.306 --> 15:40.707
* Now I'm ready to mic it

15:40.740 --> 15:44.011
* You know I like it *
* Huh

15:44.044 --> 15:46.079
* Hear my favoritism roll "Oh"

15:46.113 --> 15:48.448
* Never be a brother like me
go solo *

15:48.481 --> 15:50.450
* Lazer, anastasia, maze ya

15:50.483 --> 15:52.352
* Ways to blaze your brain
and train ya *

15:52.385 --> 15:54.254
* The way I'm livin', forgivin'
what I'm givin' up *

15:54.287 --> 15:57.024
* Respect's been givin'
how's ya livin' *

15:57.057 --> 15:59.459
* Now I can't protect
a paid off defect *

15:59.492 --> 16:02.162
* Check the record
an reckon an intentional wreck *

16:02.195 --> 16:03.596
* Played off as some intellect

16:03.630 --> 16:06.433
* Made the call, took the fall,
broke the laws *

16:06.466 --> 16:09.036
* Not my fault that
they're fallin' off *

16:09.069 --> 16:11.704
* Known as fair and square
throughout my years *

16:11.738 --> 16:13.240
* So I growl
at the livin' foul *

16:13.273 --> 16:16.109
* Black to the bone,
my home is your home *

16:16.143 --> 16:17.677
* But welcome
to the Terrordome *

16:17.710 --> 16:19.479
* Number one jam
* Get down *

16:22.249 --> 16:25.318
* Come on down
* Get down *

16:25.352 --> 16:27.720
* Come on down...

16:34.127 --> 16:36.729
My deed was done,
and at home, my dad was undone.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.265
Here you go.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.566
$268?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.268
To unclog a drain?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.603
It wasn't just
a clogged drain.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.806
I had to replace a U pipe,
your trap, washers,

16:46.839 --> 16:48.441
your valves.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.810
What the hell you been pouring
down that drain anyway?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.479
It smells like hot sauce.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.281
It's Drainada.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.416
Spanish Drano?
Sí, Señor.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.351
Do me a favor--
keep using that stuff.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.420
It's good for business.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.489
Do you take coupons?

17:02.522 --> 17:05.358
Tragic, tragic!

17:08.695 --> 17:11.264
All it took for my mother
to clean Drew's gown

17:11.298 --> 17:14.467
was a pair of scissors
and a well-placed scarf.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.668
Let's hear it

17:15.702 --> 17:19.339
for our most popular student
with a 2.0 grade point average,

17:19.372 --> 17:20.273
Drew!

17:20.307 --> 17:22.109
That's my brother!

17:24.411 --> 17:25.512
Where'd he
get that?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.747
With that plumbing bill, I
hope I didn't pay for it.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.117
I made it from what was left
of his gown.

17:30.150 --> 17:30.983
Hey, Drew!

17:31.017 --> 17:33.653
My family didn't get
this excited

17:33.686 --> 17:36.789
about anything I did
until my first HBO special.

17:36.823 --> 17:40.327
The next day I found out
I had taken revenge

17:40.360 --> 17:42.662
to a whole new level.

17:44.664 --> 17:49.502
* School's out forever

17:51.504 --> 17:56.376
* School's been blown
to pieces... *

17:56.409 --> 17:58.378
REPORTER:
We're standing outside
Corleone Junior High,

17:58.411 --> 17:59.446
where just an hour ago,

17:59.479 --> 18:01.648
toxic fumes
filled the hallways and...

18:01.681 --> 18:04.317
You're not telling me we're
supposed to go back in there?

18:04.351 --> 18:06.319
That is an
awful smell.
It's not toxic.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.188
It's somewhere on
the first floor,
maybe the locker.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.761
What's that?

18:16.163 --> 18:21.401
* No more teachers'
dirty looks... *

18:21.434 --> 18:24.404
Where is she going?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.807
Oh,
my God!

18:27.840 --> 18:29.842
GREG:
It's like that movie

18:29.876 --> 18:31.511
The Birds.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.346
Except with cats.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.514
That's my locker.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.549
Open it.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.622
Looks like we've got
ourselves a little
practical joker.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.790
You think this is funny?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.858
I do.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.430
There's cat food
in the heating ducts.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.432
In the desks.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.400
All over.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.168
I didn't do this.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.404
Oh, really? You think
because this is the last day

18:57.437 --> 18:59.172
of school, you're gonna
get away with this?

18:59.206 --> 19:00.540
You're sadly mistaken.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.343
Not only are you not going
to get away with it,

19:03.376 --> 19:05.178
you'll be paying
for this all summer.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.646
What?!

19:08.248 --> 19:12.151
Revenge might be cold,
but I felt warm all over.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.257
So how'd it go in there?

19:17.290 --> 19:19.359
I don't got time
for you, Bean Pie.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.361
Bean Pie? Oh, I
got your Bean Pie.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.596
That's why you're spending the
rest of the summer in detention.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.964
What do you know about that?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.400
Well, I know that this
time you got detention.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.502
Next time you might get
kicked out of school.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.570
You set me up?

19:30.603 --> 19:33.406
Could have been me, or it
could have been anybody.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.508
All I know is
that if I was you,

19:35.542 --> 19:36.943
I wouldn't mess
with me again.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.546
See you in
September, Spanky.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.748
Oh, Chris.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.616
I was just coming to see you.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.285
You were

19:45.318 --> 19:46.553
I've got some bad news.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.920
You failed Science.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.622
You have to go
to summer school.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.457
Summer school?!

19:50.490 --> 19:52.592
Perhaps next year
you'll study harder.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.597
See you Monday... Booger.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.801
Can't we all just get along?

20:01.834 --> 20:06.839
* Everybody hates Chris...

20:10.643 --> 20:14.647
