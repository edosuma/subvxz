01:11.280 --> 01:14.443
<i>I never dreamed
that the life of my grandsons...</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:17.650
<i>which began with such love and comfort...</i>

01:18.287 --> 01:21.552
<i>would turn to see
so much violence and bloodshed.</i>

01:26.094 --> 01:30.189
<i>This is their story, as it was told to me.</i>

02:00.696 --> 02:02.459
We should disappear.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.199
Go someplace where we can see everything.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.540
Let me see your knife.

02:14.776 --> 02:17.210
Can I carve my name in your face?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.878
You goddamn son of a bitch!

03:35.457 --> 03:36.685
Chris!

04:39.387 --> 04:40.479
God!

05:04.579 --> 05:07.047
Brandy, get over here. Come here!

05:40.415 --> 05:41.716
He's getting away.

05:41.816 --> 05:44.119
That son of a bitch
broke my goddamn window!

05:44.219 --> 05:45.550
Calm down.

06:19.354 --> 06:21.413
You angry about something?

06:23.525 --> 06:24.583
No.

06:33.068 --> 06:34.763
He said that he...

06:35.837 --> 06:38.169
has just about had it with you.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.638
You want the truth?

06:43.445 --> 06:46.812
I think you pushed your old man
just about as far as you can push him.

06:54.089 --> 06:57.025
<i>I drive down here once a week
to bail your ass out of some mess.</i>

06:57.125 --> 07:00.195
<i>I don't want to hear your excuse.
Go on outside and get in the car.</i>

07:00.295 --> 07:01.296
<i>Just wait.</i>

07:01.396 --> 07:03.557
What? What am I waiting for, buddy?

07:04.065 --> 07:06.701
You gonna collect yourself,
show me some respect?

07:06.801 --> 07:07.936
What's it gonna take, Chris?

07:08.036 --> 07:10.266
- I'm not going!
- I said, get in the goddamn car.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.546
Today was supposed to be
about your brother.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.171
It's his birthday. It's not about you.

07:24.552 --> 07:26.888
Bad enough we're waiting
with our party hats on...

07:26.988 --> 07:29.824
to get a call like that,
how do you think that makes Tim feel?

07:29.924 --> 07:30.913
It's all right, Dad.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.928
No, it's not all right.

07:35.096 --> 07:37.929
Don't you care about anybody but yourself?

07:50.111 --> 07:53.281
<i>...searching for an escaped inmate
after yesterday's prison break...</i>

07:53.381 --> 07:55.784
<i>at the County Penitentiary.</i>

07:55.884 --> 07:59.487
<i>Two guards were stripped and killed
in the incident following the riot.</i>

07:59.587 --> 08:01.214
<i>In college basketball...</i>

08:31.686 --> 08:33.722
You can forget about
that girlfriend of yours.

08:33.822 --> 08:36.791
Duck out on your responsibility again,
I'll bury you alive.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.394
- You never let me leave this place.
- You wanna leave?

08:39.494 --> 08:42.530
- You wanna leave this place?
- We can't even have friends!

08:42.630 --> 08:45.656
What kind of birthday is it
with just the three of us?

08:45.767 --> 08:48.292
It's like we're being locked up,
and for what?

08:48.903 --> 08:51.428
What are you afraid we're gonna do?

09:39.354 --> 09:41.754
I'm sorry I ruined your birthday.

09:43.024 --> 09:46.255
I thought my birthday party
would be a lot of fun.

09:48.029 --> 09:51.829
You and Dad and me,
we'd all have a good time.

09:53.435 --> 09:56.268
But it didn't happen like that.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.371
Before you know it...

10:01.609 --> 10:03.270
things you say...

10:05.413 --> 10:07.313
nobody's gonna listen.

10:09.284 --> 10:11.275
I know what you feel.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.081
You're just a kid.

10:17.592 --> 10:19.583
Enjoy it while it lasts.

10:21.196 --> 10:24.029
<i>Now I'd like to introduce a special trio.</i>

10:24.899 --> 10:28.303
<i>The Rebecca Trio have come,
and have a song...</i>

10:28.403 --> 10:32.533
<i>about what wonderful grace
the Lord Jesus Christ gives us to live with.</i>

10:36.377 --> 10:39.581
<i>I feel the touch</i>

10:39.681 --> 10:44.152
<i>Of hands so kind and tender</i>

10:44.252 --> 10:47.483
<i>They're leading me</i>

10:47.655 --> 10:51.614
<i>In paths that I must trod</i>

10:51.893 --> 10:54.828
<i>I'll have no fear</i>

10:54.996 --> 10:58.989
<i>When Jesus walks beside me</i>

10:59.534 --> 11:03.204
<i>For I'm sheltered in</i>

11:03.304 --> 11:05.772
<i>The arms of God</i>

11:06.007 --> 11:09.778
<i>So let the storms rage high</i>

11:09.878 --> 11:12.147
<i>The dark clouds rise</i>

11:12.247 --> 11:14.783
<i>They don't worry me</i>

11:14.883 --> 11:17.875
<i>For I'm sheltered safe</i>

11:17.986 --> 11:22.946
<i>Within the arms of God</i>

11:23.625 --> 11:26.719
<i>He walks with me</i>

11:26.861 --> 11:30.991
<i>And none other shall harm me</i>

11:31.099 --> 11:34.865
<i>For I'm sheltered in</i>

11:35.036 --> 11:37.766
<i>The arms of God</i>

11:48.716 --> 11:49.683
Chris.

11:52.687 --> 11:55.485
I'm going into town.
I won't be back till late.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.919
- Where's Tim at?
- I don't know.

11:59.394 --> 12:03.665
- You put salt water in the feed?
- Yeah, but I can't do all this by myself.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.928
Why don't you send Tim out here
to help for once?

12:08.803 --> 12:10.634
He's no good at work.

12:11.072 --> 12:12.972
Not much for strength.

12:14.509 --> 12:16.478
I'm gonna have some of his birthday cake.

12:16.578 --> 12:21.379
Not until you're done working here.
There's a lot to be done.

12:47.175 --> 12:49.405
It won't work. It won't blow.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.826
- Got a hole in your foot.
- I know.

13:09.530 --> 13:10.895
It smells.

13:15.236 --> 13:18.137
Can I stick my finger in it? In the hole?

13:18.840 --> 13:19.864
No.

13:20.408 --> 13:23.502
I would just wiggle it around,
it would be cool.

16:14.882 --> 16:16.679
You're up awful late.

16:17.885 --> 16:18.977
Dad?

16:20.354 --> 16:21.480
Yeah.

16:25.159 --> 16:26.592
You're home.

16:28.963 --> 16:30.590
I'm pretty beat.

16:33.501 --> 16:37.301
I know I've been hard on you, Chris,
but you know I love you.

16:42.076 --> 16:46.843
You must have looked pretty classic
with that board sticking out of your foot.

16:47.014 --> 16:48.845
Wished I'd seen that.

16:50.318 --> 16:51.580
It hurt.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.417
It hurt like crap.

17:00.661 --> 17:04.153
Sometimes it's the strange moments
that stick with you.

17:09.971 --> 17:11.768
I'm gonna go to bed.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.038
Good night, Dad.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.760
Tim, wake up.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.453
It's a gift.

18:09.830 --> 18:11.195
I like it.

18:59.413 --> 19:01.515
<i>You're trying to... Don't spit on me!</i>

19:01.615 --> 19:06.018
I'm tired of looking at your head.
Come up here and bring me some nails.

19:06.287 --> 19:08.414
I don't like being up there.

19:09.490 --> 19:10.855
Who's that?

19:25.606 --> 19:27.267
I think I'm lost.

19:28.142 --> 19:30.167
Does John Munn live here?

19:31.445 --> 19:34.710
- He's somewhere.
- Who are you, little man?

19:34.915 --> 19:37.509
He's here. Dad!

19:39.120 --> 19:40.678
Can I help you?

19:41.088 --> 19:42.180
John?

19:42.990 --> 19:45.754
Put that booger down, brother,
and come give me a kiss.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.920
Well, I'll be. Deel.

19:51.032 --> 19:53.193
It's a shocker, ain't It?

19:53.434 --> 19:55.026
I found you.

19:56.837 --> 19:58.270
These yours?

19:59.940 --> 20:01.066
Yeah.

20:02.943 --> 20:04.342
Come on in.

20:10.718 --> 20:14.155
- That Dad's brother?
- Never seen him before.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.281
- You like his car?
- Shut up.

20:21.662 --> 20:23.391
What are you doing?

20:23.964 --> 20:26.762
Organizing my books by the way they smell.

20:29.703 --> 20:32.069
<i>This one's about a guy...</i>

20:35.042 --> 20:37.977
Thought a lot about you,
I got to say, Deel.

20:40.481 --> 20:43.541
Yeah, well, I never did get
no valentines, John.

20:46.654 --> 20:49.680
I didn't know if you'd want
to hear from me...

20:51.392 --> 20:54.884
the way you blamed me for things.
Don't say you didn't.

20:57.498 --> 20:58.760
I won't.

21:04.271 --> 21:06.262
Then when Audrey died...

21:09.410 --> 21:11.537
I just couldn't bear it.

21:11.679 --> 21:14.148
Took the kids out of school,
didn't tell nobody.

21:14.248 --> 21:16.842
Moved out here to live
in the sticks like hermits.

21:18.219 --> 21:19.584
<i>Because people...</i>

21:20.821 --> 21:24.348
Sort of no reminders
when you tear away from people.

21:33.234 --> 21:35.168
I couldn't handle it...

21:37.037 --> 21:39.767
the thought of you stuck in that place.

21:39.940 --> 21:41.874
I was gonna go see you.

21:42.576 --> 21:45.713
I even made plans, but I didn't. I just...

21:45.813 --> 21:48.281
You don't gotta say nothing, John.

21:49.650 --> 21:51.777
I feel like if I forgive...

21:52.853 --> 21:54.878
then I'll be forgiven.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.323
Lice gets everywhere.

22:03.297 --> 22:04.696
Stay still.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.724
Was she pretty?

22:07.501 --> 22:08.866
- Who?
- Mom.

22:11.205 --> 22:14.402
She was kind of good-looking,
I guess, for a mom.

22:16.010 --> 22:18.535
She had a little moustache, though.

22:18.779 --> 22:21.612
I always thought
that was weird for a lady.

22:21.815 --> 22:24.147
I remember her kind of perfume.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.412
- You wanna smell my armpit?
- No.

22:33.627 --> 22:35.652
I wanna get me a haircut.

22:36.697 --> 22:39.131
What are you gonna do now? Got any plans?

22:39.300 --> 22:41.902
- I always got plans.
- Here, wear that.

22:42.002 --> 22:44.105
Long as I stay in the state, I'm good.

22:44.205 --> 22:47.274
Check in with the parole officer
every once in a while.

22:47.374 --> 22:49.176
I got some masonry work lined up...

22:49.276 --> 22:52.507
Watch your step there.
Tim's got a rough stomach.

23:01.155 --> 23:02.986
Got to admit, John...

23:03.824 --> 23:07.055
you look like you're doing
all right for yourself.

23:08.229 --> 23:10.220
We're doing well enough.

23:11.899 --> 23:12.900
We really are.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.630
I sold all six hogs to this Korean farmer
last week, just to clear the place out.

23:20.140 --> 23:23.344
I've been looking for a good man
to keep up around here.

23:23.444 --> 23:27.813
I got some work at this little taxidermy
shop. It's way out in Bilton.

23:29.450 --> 23:32.820
Tell you what, why don't you stick around
till your work starts?

23:32.920 --> 23:34.353
You could...

23:36.824 --> 23:38.587
be a help to me.

23:40.928 --> 23:42.327
How's that?

23:43.764 --> 23:46.096
Well, those kids are a handful.

23:51.171 --> 23:54.470
Tim's got health problems.
They're getting serious.

23:56.343 --> 23:59.813
And when I'm gone, I worry
Chris is gonna get into trouble...

23:59.913 --> 24:02.074
and not take care of his responsibility.

24:02.850 --> 24:04.552
Seems like every time I turn around...

24:04.652 --> 24:07.120
the cops got him picked him up
for something or other.

24:07.388 --> 24:11.188
<i>Breaking windows...
He popped this kid in the face with a rake.</i>

24:13.260 --> 24:15.455
Then he breaks into a church.

24:16.430 --> 24:20.730
The preacher finds him asleep
on the altar, drunk on wine.

24:25.306 --> 24:28.042
I could use another pair of eyes
around here.

24:28.142 --> 24:32.772
I couldn't pay you, but you get
a roof over your head, and I'll feed you.

24:36.083 --> 24:39.450
That way me and you could spend
some time together, like you said.

24:39.753 --> 24:41.277
I'd like that.

24:42.790 --> 24:45.054
It's all the same to me.

24:47.828 --> 24:50.353
A chicken ain't nothing but a bird.

24:52.399 --> 24:54.301
Remember them old Mexican gold coins...

24:54.401 --> 24:57.165
Dad stole from that museum
when we was kids?

24:57.771 --> 25:02.174
He always said when he died,
you and me should split up the worth...

25:04.411 --> 25:06.675
and treat ourselves like kings.

25:10.084 --> 25:13.815
When he died, they raided this place.
They took everything.

25:16.523 --> 25:19.083
They even took those old Indian ashtrays.

25:21.428 --> 25:23.760
Old man was a hell of a pirate.

25:25.532 --> 25:27.466
But the worst taste in art.

25:31.605 --> 25:33.300
I like them boots.

25:35.376 --> 25:37.173
They're pretty cool.

25:39.380 --> 25:40.870
You're cool.

25:44.284 --> 25:47.253
<i>I don't think
he's got anyplace else to stay.</i>

25:49.823 --> 25:52.690
He's gonna stay with us
for a little while.

25:53.293 --> 25:55.193
We'll see how it goes.

25:56.897 --> 25:58.558
What are you doing?

26:05.706 --> 26:08.008
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.736
Y'all sleep tight. I'm gonna hit it.

26:11.044 --> 26:12.875
It's good to be here.

26:13.213 --> 26:14.612
Good night.

26:15.883 --> 26:19.944
<i>Oh, this here's the boat I've hoped for</i>

26:21.121 --> 26:24.022
<i>Oh, land, please pardon me</i>

26:24.458 --> 26:27.086
That's a song my father used to sing.

26:29.730 --> 26:31.994
I haven't heard that in years.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.732
What's wrong?

27:17.344 --> 27:20.541
<i>I'm just... I'm scared of the way
you make me feel.</i>

27:22.483 --> 27:26.419
- I think I might be too young for my head.
- I didn't touch you.

27:31.325 --> 27:33.156
It's your dad, right?

27:35.162 --> 27:37.426
I don't know what we're doing.

27:45.906 --> 27:48.238
I care about you, Chris, but...

27:49.543 --> 27:50.805
I can't.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.643
Hot enough for you?

29:04.751 --> 29:07.219
It ain't the heat that gets to me.

29:07.888 --> 29:09.156
It's the stupidity.

29:09.256 --> 29:11.622
Goddamn, this is a beautiful land.

29:19.099 --> 29:22.068
I used to take days like this for granted.

29:25.572 --> 29:27.563
We've had a lot of rain.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.808
So it's like...

29:30.978 --> 29:32.502
all this life.

29:33.347 --> 29:36.805
It's like living in a fishbowl.
That's what it's like.

29:37.117 --> 29:38.175
What?

29:39.686 --> 29:44.123
I said it's like living in a fishbowl,
being stuck here like a workhorse.

29:45.525 --> 29:48.255
Must get kind of cramped being a slave.

29:48.662 --> 29:51.426
Me, I gotta get away now and then.
What about you?

29:56.103 --> 29:57.934
God, I love to drive.

29:58.939 --> 30:00.736
Has he changed much?

30:00.974 --> 30:03.977
- From when y'all were kids?
- Old John?

30:04.077 --> 30:06.375
No, he's pretty much the same.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.778
He's got a few silly new fur coats,
kind of queer.

30:11.451 --> 30:14.249
Did you know my mom?

30:14.354 --> 30:17.118
I knew your mom first. She was my girl.

30:18.458 --> 30:21.595
He didn't mention
that little detail, though, huh?

30:21.695 --> 30:24.027
No, I shouldn't think he would.

30:24.264 --> 30:26.528
What did he tell you about me?

30:31.672 --> 30:33.799
He said you were in prison.

30:34.241 --> 30:37.506
- You got a girlfriend?
- Not really.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.470
That's smart, boy.

30:39.846 --> 30:43.116
You gotta live a little first.
Girls mess with your head.

30:43.216 --> 30:45.207
Make you do crazy things.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.455
Did you hurt somebody?

30:54.394 --> 30:57.158
You wanna drive? I'll work the gearshift.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.167
- Nah.
- Somebody better take the wheel.

31:00.267 --> 31:01.702
- Better take the wheel.
- No!

31:01.802 --> 31:05.670
Come on, champ. Take it.
Somebody better take the wheel, kiddo.

31:09.443 --> 31:11.172
Shit, yeah!

31:18.485 --> 31:20.680
I forgot what it feels like.

31:20.787 --> 31:22.414
What feels like?

31:25.692 --> 31:27.250
Are you scared?

31:51.418 --> 31:53.477
Here, Tim, try some sweet potatoes.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.322
Tim don't eat much.

31:55.422 --> 31:57.624
What, is he afraid
he'll get fat or something?

31:57.724 --> 32:01.558
He's already got a bunch of cellulite.
Look at all that goop.

32:02.262 --> 32:04.059
It's about affinity.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.933
Doctor says his brain ain't ready for it.

32:07.033 --> 32:09.236
- It's an anxiety disorder.
- Freaks out his ulcer.

32:09.336 --> 32:11.371
It's called an anxiety disorder.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.807
Take your hat off at the table.
It ain't Thanksgiving.

32:13.907 --> 32:17.144
When I was a boy,
I used to worry about Pilgrims.

32:17.244 --> 32:19.913
I had this nightmare
that a whole bunch of you bastards...

32:20.013 --> 32:22.215
would bust into my room
with your shirts off...

32:22.315 --> 32:24.374
and you'd tickle me crazy.

32:24.584 --> 32:28.918
You'd make me walk the plank
or eat turkey until I got fat.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.489
You'd force me to just eat and eat.

32:33.493 --> 32:36.621
Till all of a sudden
I realized I was an animal.

32:37.597 --> 32:39.724
An animal eating an animal.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.560
Then I'd wake up with a start...

32:43.436 --> 32:45.734
and find I'd pissed my pajamas.

32:49.009 --> 32:53.146
It is kind of funny now.
It wasn't so funny then.

32:53.246 --> 32:55.115
How much work did you guys get done today?

32:55.215 --> 32:56.842
Not as much as we hoped.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.351
We had to run into town,
get some supplies.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.319
Come on, now. Dish up.

33:05.926 --> 33:07.757
Y'all say grace?

33:08.228 --> 33:11.163
Occasionally. Feel free.

33:11.331 --> 33:14.367
Thank you for this food.
Hope everybody has a nice time. Amen.

33:14.467 --> 33:16.935
- Hallelujah.
- I want a leg.

33:20.507 --> 33:22.372
Supplies in town, huh?

33:23.476 --> 33:27.742
Well, tell you the truth,
Chris wanted to take a ride in my car...

33:28.348 --> 33:32.919
and I could've said no, but I didn't want
to get off on the wrong foot with him.

33:33.019 --> 33:34.646
You went driving?

33:35.021 --> 33:37.251
I get home and nothing's done.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.928
You're sure right about them two.
They ain't exactly fond of work.

33:42.028 --> 33:46.192
I kept having to stop what I was doing
to go and track them down.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.836
Don't put it all on the boys, Deel.

33:49.936 --> 33:53.673
That's not what we agreed on.
You're supposed to look after them.

33:53.773 --> 33:57.539
I'm just trying to give the kids
some elbow room.

33:58.845 --> 34:01.548
We were not exactly angels
when we were their age, John.

34:01.648 --> 34:04.048
That's right.

34:06.186 --> 34:08.279
You don't trust me, do you?

34:09.322 --> 34:13.520
- If you want me to leave, just say so.
- No.

34:20.433 --> 34:24.130
For the longest time out here,
just me and the boys, I was sure...

34:24.971 --> 34:26.996
I'd made a wreck of things.

34:28.808 --> 34:30.605
You know what I mean?

34:31.378 --> 34:33.710
I just wanted us to be a family.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.779
Well, anyhow, now you're here.

34:38.885 --> 34:41.012
Maybe I got a second chance.

34:41.554 --> 34:44.022
- Let's not mess it up.
- Okay.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.428
- Are you gonna eat that?
- What?

34:48.527 --> 34:51.827
- That.
- No, go on. Help yourself.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.260
Big old piece of gristle.

35:02.542 --> 35:04.533
Hurry up. Dad wants you.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.003
Hi.

35:16.923 --> 35:18.015
Yeah?

35:18.959 --> 35:20.017
Dad?

35:22.495 --> 35:25.225
Remember when we had that painting made?

35:25.832 --> 35:30.360
Had to stand still, without sleeping.
It took a night and a day.

35:31.438 --> 35:32.803
What did I do now?

35:53.093 --> 35:54.219
Fuck.

36:14.014 --> 36:16.414
So I hear you just had a birthday.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.477
How old does that make you?

36:19.686 --> 36:21.176
- Ten years old.
- Ten.

36:23.857 --> 36:28.055
Well, you're a heck of a lot smarter
than most 10-year-olds I know.

36:28.762 --> 36:30.889
That is a sharp-looking jet.

36:31.464 --> 36:33.557
- Chris made it by hand.
- Damn nice.

36:37.303 --> 36:41.034
You're daddy's got
a lot of real nice things, too, don't he?

36:43.443 --> 36:44.911
You know, when I was your age...

36:45.011 --> 36:49.107
my daddy, he had a collection
of old Mexican coins.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.650
He used to let me and John
play with them sometimes.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.878
They were solid gold.

36:55.055 --> 36:56.955
Dad has some like that.

36:58.591 --> 36:59.990
I knew that.

37:02.295 --> 37:07.255
You know, your granddaddy,
he gave them to John and me, his two sons.

37:08.568 --> 37:11.935
Your dad, he probably just forgot
that half are mine.

37:13.306 --> 37:15.399
Where does he keep them at?

37:16.142 --> 37:17.666
Keeps them hid.

37:17.911 --> 37:19.579
Well, where does he hide them at?

37:19.679 --> 37:21.169
It's a secret.

37:21.915 --> 37:25.715
Well, see, I'm family
and I'm pretty good at keeping secrets.

37:28.088 --> 37:30.181
It's a secret from me, too.

37:30.757 --> 37:32.247
You don't say?

37:43.837 --> 37:45.702
You shouldn't do that.

37:47.340 --> 37:50.741
You shouldn't open a can like that.
You'll bust your knife blade.

37:52.579 --> 37:54.342
What are you doing?

37:54.447 --> 37:58.975
I found your stack of nudie books
in a chest under a rock back here.

38:00.086 --> 38:03.647
- You got good taste.
- That stuff ain't mine.

38:03.857 --> 38:05.882
I ain't gonna say nothing.

38:06.593 --> 38:09.892
I ain't got no business
busting in on dirty secrets.

38:11.030 --> 38:13.726
Besides, me and you is friends.
Ain't that right?

38:16.870 --> 38:19.202
- That's right.
- Yeah.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.569
I never had all the advantages like John.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.677
I got the leavings
and was told to like it.

38:29.682 --> 38:33.118
I see the way your daddy
looks at your little brother.

38:34.220 --> 38:35.949
You know there's something.

38:37.157 --> 38:40.524
He sees himself.
Like looking in a goddamn mirror.

38:41.794 --> 38:43.421
Then there's you.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.689
You're just one of his little pigs.

38:48.168 --> 38:49.965
A hole in the ground.

38:53.573 --> 38:55.234
I like you, Chris.

38:55.808 --> 38:57.605
You don't play games.

39:00.947 --> 39:05.008
Don't ever let the same dog bite you twice.
You know what I mean?

39:14.327 --> 39:16.963
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

39:17.063 --> 39:18.832
- Interrupting cow.
- Interrupting-cow who?

39:18.932 --> 39:20.024
Moo!

39:27.807 --> 39:29.468
It doesn't work.

39:31.377 --> 39:33.709
You've got the wrong tool.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.884
Did you and Uncle Deel fight a lot
when you were kids?

39:39.085 --> 39:42.088
We had our problems...

39:42.188 --> 39:45.157
but our dad didn't put up
with too much nonsense.

39:45.458 --> 39:48.985
He was nice too, right?
He gave you that treasure.

39:49.762 --> 39:53.562
You mean those coins?
That's right, he did.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.003
You know those coins ain't ordinary coins?

39:57.103 --> 39:58.661
What do you mean?

40:00.440 --> 40:03.637
- It's a long story.
- It's from pirates?

40:03.910 --> 40:08.347
No, not exactly. Do you know about Charon,
the ferryman of the dead?

40:10.717 --> 40:14.387
According to a legend,
when you pass into the realm of the dead...

40:14.487 --> 40:18.446
your spirit has to pay passage
to cross the river Styx into Hades.

40:18.591 --> 40:22.721
You have to pay Charon.
He's the ferryman. He's this winged demon.

40:23.029 --> 40:25.554
The price, one gold coin per soul.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.068
If you don't have a coin...

40:29.168 --> 40:33.072
then you're condemned to wander
the banks of the river for 100 years.

40:33.172 --> 40:34.662
Like in hell?

40:38.177 --> 40:39.201
No.

40:40.246 --> 40:41.713
Just waiting.

40:44.651 --> 40:48.154
<i>A long time ago,
my father went for a walk to the river.</i>

40:48.254 --> 40:52.918
At the ferry crossing, he sees this old
Mexican ferryman, all dressed in rags...

40:54.093 --> 40:57.722
pays him a nickel, crosses over,
doesn't think much of it.

40:57.864 --> 41:00.900
When he gets home,
he reaches his hand in his pocket...

41:01.000 --> 41:04.834
and pulls out a gold coin
that hadn't been there before.

41:05.471 --> 41:08.907
But my dad couldn't stop thinking
about that poor man.

41:09.909 --> 41:12.343
How much food that coin would buy.

41:12.879 --> 41:15.780
So the next day,
he crosses the river again.

41:16.749 --> 41:18.944
<i>He gives the man a gold coin.</i>

41:19.285 --> 41:22.288
The man thanks him
and takes him across the river.

41:22.388 --> 41:25.551
But when he got home, he reaches in...

41:26.192 --> 41:28.558
and now he's got two gold coins.

41:28.795 --> 41:31.464
Same thing happened the next day,
and the day after:

41:31.564 --> 41:32.963
Five coins.

41:33.700 --> 41:37.003
Then 10, and 20 and 40. On and on.

41:37.103 --> 41:39.230
His pockets grew fat.

41:40.907 --> 41:42.675
Then one day, the river dried up...

41:42.775 --> 41:45.175
the ferryman was gone and never came back.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.878
My dad said he thought that was Charon.

41:50.650 --> 41:53.016
<i>And that he was paying the living...</i>

41:53.519 --> 41:54.854
<i>what he kept from the dead.</i>

41:54.954 --> 41:58.788
<i>That's why I saved them all this time.
Those coins are cursed.</i>

42:00.693 --> 42:03.287
They're the debt the dead had to pay.

42:04.464 --> 42:08.901
If they're worth so much, why don't you
just sell them so we can get rich?

42:09.168 --> 42:11.504
I pawned one off last year
to buy that station wagon.

42:11.604 --> 42:15.170
You see what a pain in the ass that's been,
it went to prove my point.

42:15.975 --> 42:17.602
<i>There are demons.</i>

42:19.345 --> 42:21.836
And they got a sick sense of humor.

42:24.917 --> 42:28.512
Go on, now. Get washed up, you sculp.

42:30.556 --> 42:32.581
Dad, why was Deel in jail?

42:42.468 --> 42:44.698
Before our parents died...

42:47.006 --> 42:49.702
he got some bad news that upset him.

42:52.512 --> 42:54.412
It was something I did.

42:55.882 --> 42:57.747
I let my brother down.

42:58.985 --> 43:00.953
But I'm not proud of it.

43:02.789 --> 43:05.121
He came to find me for a reason.

43:37.356 --> 43:39.085
What are you doing?

43:42.028 --> 43:44.155
Dressing up in your clothes.

43:44.597 --> 43:46.326
Pretending I'm you.

43:47.266 --> 43:49.826
Your boots are a little
too big, though, honestly.

43:50.870 --> 43:55.307
- I thought things were good between us.
- You lied to me, John. I knew it.

43:55.575 --> 43:58.669
Always twisting things around
so you come out on top.

43:58.978 --> 44:02.548
I show up and you got a second chance?
Well, I never had a first chance.

44:02.648 --> 44:05.276
You and the old man saw to that.

44:05.585 --> 44:09.988
First my girl, now my money.
Everything that belongs to me is here.

44:11.424 --> 44:12.982
Don't bring Audrey into this.

44:13.125 --> 44:16.686
You brought her into it.
When I was pinned down.

44:17.330 --> 44:20.633
When I walk into my own bedroom
and see you with my girl.

44:20.733 --> 44:22.701
Seen you with her, John!

44:23.269 --> 44:24.736
That's right.

44:25.872 --> 44:28.397
She's an old case and you won, John.

44:29.008 --> 44:32.171
But Chris is my son
and you've always known that.

44:34.113 --> 44:35.876
Get out of my house.

44:38.584 --> 44:40.609
I can't let this go, John.

44:43.689 --> 44:47.989
- I'm not gonna stand here and listen to this.
- That's because you never listen.

44:48.828 --> 44:50.591
You never listen to me.

44:52.431 --> 44:54.133
As for what I did, we were young.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.636
I'm sorry.
Is that what you want me to say?

44:56.736 --> 44:58.104
I want my money.

44:58.204 --> 45:01.139
Put those coins down.
You think that's gonna make it better?

45:02.808 --> 45:05.174
Those coins are greed, Deel.

45:05.411 --> 45:08.244
It's your own greed
you're trying to disguise.

45:08.948 --> 45:11.109
You're scared of this world.

45:11.284 --> 45:14.344
You think if you hide everything,
it'll be easy.

45:18.591 --> 45:21.492
Don't ever hit me again. You hear me?

46:04.904 --> 46:06.565
Son of a bitch!

46:22.622 --> 46:23.611
No!

47:32.558 --> 47:33.889
Open it.

47:38.330 --> 47:39.854
Come here.

47:42.368 --> 47:43.995
What's happening?

47:47.807 --> 47:49.434
Is it Uncle Deel?

48:08.861 --> 48:10.226
Let's move.

48:10.696 --> 48:12.220
What about Dad?

49:08.854 --> 49:10.481
He's out there...

49:12.758 --> 49:14.225
somewhere.

49:16.262 --> 49:17.286
Go.

49:24.170 --> 49:26.138
Let's go out the back.

49:33.212 --> 49:34.304
Dad!

50:09.882 --> 50:10.974
Hell!

50:14.486 --> 50:17.423
- Out the window! Come on!
- I can't, Chris. It's too high.

50:17.523 --> 50:21.660
Yes, you can! It's in your head. Quick.
Climb down the ladder. Come on. Get down.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.489
- Are you coming?
- Just go.

50:23.829 --> 50:25.228
I can't!

50:55.628 --> 50:57.425
This is how it looks.

50:58.230 --> 51:00.164
Nobody knows I'm here.

51:02.401 --> 51:05.268
The law already has an opinion of you.

51:06.805 --> 51:08.670
And it's your knife...

51:10.075 --> 51:11.975
that killed my brother.

51:13.412 --> 51:15.141
It's a pity, too.

51:15.614 --> 51:17.479
You and I was friends.

51:21.287 --> 51:23.221
Chris!

51:54.186 --> 51:55.380
Get in!

52:04.797 --> 52:06.526
I can't drive stick.

52:06.765 --> 52:08.289
The coins!

52:10.803 --> 52:12.498
Give me those.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.102
Get out. Move!

52:16.241 --> 52:17.503
His keys.

52:22.214 --> 52:23.613
Come on!

53:47.833 --> 53:49.868
Are we gonna tell the police?

53:49.968 --> 53:52.232
He's got my knife and my fingerprints.

53:56.208 --> 53:58.199
Cops will think I did it.

54:10.856 --> 54:13.950
Everybody's looking for a reason
to put me away.

54:29.408 --> 54:30.670
You okay?

54:33.445 --> 54:35.037
Did he hurt you?

54:36.682 --> 54:37.706
No.

54:44.289 --> 54:45.779
We got nobody.

54:48.026 --> 54:49.891
Where are we gonna go?

54:52.197 --> 54:54.165
We'll shave our heads...

54:54.366 --> 54:56.960
grow beards and only speak Apache.

54:57.102 --> 54:58.569
I don't know.

55:00.606 --> 55:02.506
We should go to Mexico.

55:03.041 --> 55:04.702
Gold's good there.

55:09.581 --> 55:12.414
We can't sell them. It's bad luck.

55:17.022 --> 55:19.422
I'll take all the luck I can get.

56:17.382 --> 56:18.781
I got an idea.

56:19.885 --> 56:21.113
Come on.

56:29.895 --> 56:31.226
Excuse us!

56:34.132 --> 56:38.262
If you need any work done,
we'll give you a hand for a bite to eat.

57:30.289 --> 57:31.551
Nice hat.

57:39.197 --> 57:40.289
Boys!

57:42.000 --> 57:43.524
Lunch is ready.

57:44.870 --> 57:47.498
Okay, y'all. Eat some of this shit.

57:58.684 --> 58:00.652
You want to hear a joke?

58:00.986 --> 58:03.113
It's a Mexican weather joke.

58:03.622 --> 58:06.056
What's the weather like in Mexico?

58:07.059 --> 58:08.993
Chili today, hot tamale.

58:12.864 --> 58:15.033
- Aw, come on...
- You and your jokes!

58:15.133 --> 58:17.601
It's a damn funny joke.

58:21.340 --> 58:24.036
There's some damn fine food up in here.

58:24.276 --> 58:25.937
Really? Think so?

58:26.611 --> 58:30.138
It's been a long time
since somebody treated us so good.

58:30.949 --> 58:32.280
Thank you.

58:32.718 --> 58:37.485
It's been a long time
since we had some young people...

58:38.724 --> 58:40.123
sit with us.

58:43.428 --> 58:45.658
We're unable to have children.

58:52.771 --> 58:55.262
We had us a little one for a while.

59:01.480 --> 59:03.141
A little baby boy.

59:04.449 --> 59:06.679
But he wouldn't take my milk.

59:10.188 --> 59:15.023
I tried and tried, but my breasts
were strangers to him.

59:16.094 --> 59:20.121
What we do now is
we count the blessings that we do have.

59:21.967 --> 59:23.195
My baby.

59:26.038 --> 59:27.130
Amen.

59:28.974 --> 59:31.033
Praise Jesus.

59:34.613 --> 59:36.513
Little man, eat.

59:38.116 --> 59:41.950
Because you don't eat,
you won't be able to grow up like this.

01:00:50.055 --> 01:00:51.215
Hello.

01:00:56.595 --> 01:00:58.722
You know what Wadsworth did?

01:00:59.731 --> 01:01:00.799
What?

01:01:00.899 --> 01:01:05.233
Pulled a nickel out of my armpit.
Can't buy much with a nickel.

01:01:09.808 --> 01:01:11.435
I like this goat.

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:26.081
You don't look so good
and you didn't hardly eat.

01:01:26.658 --> 01:01:28.683
You don't like my cooking?

01:01:32.764 --> 01:01:37.098
Now, you boys look exhausted.
Why don't you stay here and rest a while?

01:02:18.677 --> 01:02:20.304
My shoulder hurt.

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.610
That little one looks so sick.

01:02:27.252 --> 01:02:28.981
What about my pain?

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.522
He said keep an eye on them...

01:02:37.395 --> 01:02:39.295
that he'd be here soon.

01:02:40.665 --> 01:02:42.634
I hope I done the right thing.

01:02:42.734 --> 01:02:44.201
Be all right.

01:02:44.369 --> 01:02:48.271
They probably just lost and hungry,
forgot where their home was.

01:02:48.673 --> 01:02:50.402
I done that myself.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.573
Where they at, anyway?

01:02:53.745 --> 01:02:57.704
- They're in a hammock, resting.
- Out back?

01:03:00.885 --> 01:03:03.217
I told him they would be there.

01:03:53.471 --> 01:03:54.631
Howdy.

01:03:55.974 --> 01:03:57.236
Mr. Pela?

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:01.910
Nice place.

01:04:03.515 --> 01:04:05.217
It's a damn nice place you got.

01:04:05.317 --> 01:04:07.385
Them boys is pretty smooth.

01:04:07.485 --> 01:04:09.688
I ain't surprised
they got one over on you, either.

01:04:09.788 --> 01:04:11.022
Didn't take me over.

01:04:11.122 --> 01:04:15.227
They ran out this morning when they seen
the workload I had for them.

01:04:15.327 --> 01:04:16.521
Really?

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:21.633
- What's wrong?
- Howdy, ma'am. How're you doing?

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:24.903
They're gone. They disappeared.
They ran off.

01:04:25.003 --> 01:04:28.740
What you mean, they're gone?
When's the last time you seen them?

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.576
- I don't know.
- Did they tell you where they're going?

01:04:31.676 --> 01:04:34.412
They said they were
going down to Watertown...

01:04:34.512 --> 01:04:36.309
working on the water.

01:04:37.615 --> 01:04:40.885
We should call the sheriff.
Get a couple of cars out looking for them.

01:04:40.985 --> 01:04:44.318
- They couldn't have got far.
- Don't be calling the sheriff, damn it!

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.563
- Tim.
- Yeah?

01:05:00.705 --> 01:05:02.366
- Guess what?
- What?

01:05:04.843 --> 01:05:07.073
- There's a cow.
- I know.

01:05:10.248 --> 01:05:12.682
I want to milk the hell out of it.

01:05:36.741 --> 01:05:38.140
Get them up!

01:06:13.711 --> 01:06:15.178
I miss Dad...

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.741
and the hogs...

01:06:18.116 --> 01:06:19.640
and my books...

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:21.679
and my shower cap.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:23.814
I know.

01:06:24.889 --> 01:06:28.450
When Dad died,
you think he got across the river?

01:06:30.929 --> 01:06:32.797
We should keep the coins.

01:06:32.897 --> 01:06:36.162
Dad might need them
for the ferryman and come back.

01:06:40.839 --> 01:06:43.171
I think you might have chiggers.

01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:47.904
They're too small to see,
so it's just from the bites.

01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:50.204
The bites are really big.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:53.847
You know, chiggers...

01:06:54.118 --> 01:06:58.851
they're, like, the smallest animals on earth
to have such a harmful bite.

01:06:59.157 --> 01:07:01.955
<i>They hurt a lot and it's like poison ivy.</i>

01:07:04.195 --> 01:07:06.464
<i>I read a book about them...</i>

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.759
<i>but it was a long time ago...</i>

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.031
<i>and I forget now.</i>

01:07:11.703 --> 01:07:15.373
<i>But I do remember that they don't
bite your skin, they just...</i>

01:07:15.473 --> 01:07:18.343
<i>Well, they bite your skin,
they don't feed off of it.</i>

01:07:18.443 --> 01:07:21.606
<i>They just bite it,
and that's where their nest is...</i>

01:07:22.313 --> 01:07:25.942
<i>that little red dot.
And if you smush them, they die.</i>

01:07:26.518 --> 01:07:29.154
<i>They're all red, but in the middle,
it's even redder...</i>

01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:32.712
<i>like flowers, you know, with the thorns.</i>

01:07:34.726 --> 01:07:39.390
<i>But on the outside they're just pink,
like your bumps right there.</i>

01:07:45.837 --> 01:07:48.273
<i>If we were like big-size chiggers...</i>

01:07:48.373 --> 01:07:51.968
<i>if I bit you, there'd be a big lump
on your head.</i>

01:07:52.343 --> 01:07:53.708
<i>Really big.</i>

01:07:56.481 --> 01:07:59.382
<i>Because the bites are bigger
than they are.</i>

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.720
<i>So it would hurt a lot.</i>

01:08:07.325 --> 01:08:11.159
<i>If we moved to some country
like Iceland or Nebraska...</i>

01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:16.689
<i>there it's too cold for them,
so we'd be safe.</i>

01:08:18.502 --> 01:08:21.131
<i>And they'd all either die or run away.</i>

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:37.087
I couldn't tell
if that was a man or a woman.

01:08:37.388 --> 01:08:40.015
There are a lot of red ants over here.

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:08.779
Do you like books?

01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:10.609
Yup.

01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:16.417
<i>The Jinx of Payrock Canyon.
That's a really good book.</i>

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:20.298
<i>It's about this guy who's just going around,
and then he finds this treasure.</i>

01:09:20.398 --> 01:09:23.468
<i>And he doesn't know what it is
and he has to go find it.</i>

01:09:23.568 --> 01:09:26.901
<i>When he opens it up,
it puts a curse on him.</i>

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.569
<i>And he avenges the guy...</i>

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:34.402
<i>that put the curse on him.</i>

01:09:52.997 --> 01:09:54.965
Nothing personal, Chris.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:59.804
I've got labor laws to deal with
around here. Labor laws.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:02.740
They'll take me off in handcuffs
if I hire someone like you.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.432
We have nothing here for you.

01:10:04.842 --> 01:10:06.537
I appreciate your stopping by.

01:10:08.513 --> 01:10:09.502
Shut up!

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:28.457
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

01:10:30.334 --> 01:10:32.461
- What did he want?
- Money.

01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:37.733
All I have is the nickel Wadsworth gave me.
So I gave him my book.

01:10:38.409 --> 01:10:40.934
- Why did you do that?
- I don't know.

01:10:42.146 --> 01:10:44.011
I didn't get that job.

01:10:45.717 --> 01:10:49.084
Do they have whores,
I mean horses, in Mexico?

01:10:51.355 --> 01:10:52.720
Hell, yeah.

01:10:58.196 --> 01:11:00.255
Goddamn it. Shit.

01:11:01.165 --> 01:11:02.496
Backwards.

01:11:09.373 --> 01:11:11.898
Turn off the goddamn engine, retard.

01:11:17.181 --> 01:11:19.979
Hey, man, don't I know you from someplace?

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:23.221
I don't think so.

01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:27.724
Did you ever hear of a singing
and dancing group called "The Historics"?

01:11:28.793 --> 01:11:30.194
Look man, I'm in a hurry.

01:11:30.294 --> 01:11:33.855
It's kind of like a play on words,
like storks, like the bird...

01:11:34.098 --> 01:11:35.833
but "Historics" because they...

01:11:35.933 --> 01:11:38.202
Like I said, I'm in a hurry,
and this car...

01:11:38.302 --> 01:11:40.872
keeps conking out on me
every time I try to get anywhere.

01:11:40.972 --> 01:11:43.574
<i>You think you can persuade it
to give me a little more...</i>

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:45.610
It needs torque. You know about...

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:49.168
There was another wreck the other day.

01:11:49.313 --> 01:11:53.051
An ice cream truck wiped out on the road.
We had to tow it.

01:11:53.151 --> 01:11:54.812
It still had the ice cream in it.

01:11:55.086 --> 01:11:57.646
It was melted, but we ate it anyway.

01:11:59.056 --> 01:12:01.993
Why are you standing
right behind me, Retardoe?

01:12:02.093 --> 01:12:03.890
Go back in the truck.

01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:07.627
You ever do any time?

01:12:10.001 --> 01:12:12.303
Look, I'm in a hurry.
Where you want me to sit?

01:12:12.403 --> 01:12:15.031
I just got out of charm school myself.

01:12:15.239 --> 01:12:17.969
- You can sit...
- Can I sit in the back of my car?

01:12:18.109 --> 01:12:20.845
You could, but there's always a danger
of a disconnect...

01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:22.413
and the car would roll out.

01:12:22.513 --> 01:12:25.778
You wouldn't be able to drive it
because it's dead.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:29.850
- You're coming over here now.
- I ain't sitting in the middle.

01:12:29.987 --> 01:12:34.219
Those boots are awesome.
I think they're awesome.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.262
- We can sit in...
- I'll sit in the middle.

01:12:38.362 --> 01:12:40.728
There's this one song
that The Historics do.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:43.668
<i>There's a monster in the canyon</i>

01:12:43.768 --> 01:12:47.864
<i>Don't you know
That there's a monster in the canyon</i>

01:13:27.011 --> 01:13:29.241
Think you'll ever get married?

01:13:29.714 --> 01:13:31.181
I don't know.

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:34.745
They look happy...

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:37.887
but you never can tell.

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:56.838
Thank you.

01:13:58.242 --> 01:13:59.334
Shit.

01:14:04.015 --> 01:14:06.643
You seen two kids hanging around here?

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.945
I saw a kid up the street.

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:16.119
Tied his babysitter to a tree
with a thing of barbed wire.

01:14:18.696 --> 01:14:20.561
What did he look like?

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:23.262
Just a kid, I guess.

01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:26.866
He had a double chin.

01:14:28.306 --> 01:14:29.705
Bad sunburn.

01:14:36.314 --> 01:14:37.781
What's wrong?

01:14:38.282 --> 01:14:40.011
I swallowed my gum.

01:14:40.952 --> 01:14:42.044
Shit.

01:14:43.621 --> 01:14:46.522
How did you come by
that thing on your face?

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:52.090
I choked on my gum.

01:14:55.299 --> 01:14:56.789
Kind of weird.

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:02.273
Got that radiator fixed up
as quick as we could.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:03.465
Cool.

01:15:04.008 --> 01:15:05.839
It should last a good while.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.746
Keep her fervid.

01:15:08.846 --> 01:15:10.177
All right.

01:15:11.282 --> 01:15:12.340
Bye.

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:16.748
- See you later.
- Thanks again.

01:15:21.192 --> 01:15:23.217
What, are you crying now?

01:15:24.128 --> 01:15:26.163
What does it look like I'm doing?

01:15:26.263 --> 01:15:29.061
Throwing up boogers.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.704
I'll give you a booger.
I'll give you a booger right where you...

01:15:33.804 --> 01:15:37.900
This is going in your big, fat,
stupid, baby mouth.

01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:56.193
Check it out.

01:15:56.293 --> 01:15:59.592
The old clerk thought I just went in
to take a leak.

01:16:00.297 --> 01:16:02.026
Where are we going?

01:16:02.633 --> 01:16:04.123
I'll get work.

01:16:06.137 --> 01:16:09.834
We'll get set up and then head south
till we get to Mexico...

01:16:11.976 --> 01:16:14.069
go eat cheese or something.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.271
- You want some?
- No.

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:25.453
You got the wrong damn end. Hurry up.
Come on, man!

01:16:25.823 --> 01:16:28.659
If I was looking for work out here,
who would I talk to...

01:16:28.759 --> 01:16:31.128
like working on boats or whatever?

01:16:31.228 --> 01:16:33.798
You can talk to any of these guys
on a boat around here.

01:16:33.898 --> 01:16:35.066
If he's got a boat.

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:39.337
I got a crew right now.
If I can get them to work. They won't work.

01:16:39.437 --> 01:16:43.140
They stand around jawing their mouth,
talking about hurricanes and stuff.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.143
Let me tell you the truth.
I'm looking for two boys.

01:16:46.243 --> 01:16:48.079
My boys, they run out on me.

01:16:48.179 --> 01:16:50.648
I figure they might be working out here.
You seen them?

01:16:50.748 --> 01:16:52.583
No. What they look like?

01:16:52.683 --> 01:16:54.674
A little bit like me, just smaller.

01:16:59.256 --> 01:17:00.723
Anybody here?

01:17:14.638 --> 01:17:16.128
Anybody here?

01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:12.556
I wish we had a knife
so we could kill animals that come around.

01:19:12.656 --> 01:19:15.284
You never killed nothing in your life.

01:19:18.662 --> 01:19:20.027
A mosquito.

01:19:22.099 --> 01:19:24.693
It's not a mosquito. It's a firefly.

01:19:27.037 --> 01:19:29.870
There was something
Granddaddy used to say.

01:19:32.176 --> 01:19:34.770
Something he told me a long time ago.

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.109
He was Mama's dad.

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:42.881
He was walking in the woods...

01:19:44.688 --> 01:19:46.781
and there were fireflies.

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:49.682
A bunch of them, blinking off and on.

01:19:52.096 --> 01:19:54.621
He called them nature's nightlights.

01:19:55.532 --> 01:19:58.433
To help animals
find their way in the dark.

01:20:01.872 --> 01:20:03.464
Can't keep them.

01:20:04.308 --> 01:20:06.799
They need to be able to fly around.

01:20:08.479 --> 01:20:10.504
They'll die if they can't.

01:20:12.583 --> 01:20:15.279
He had a way to calm me with his words.

01:20:15.452 --> 01:20:18.649
I couldn't tell half the time
if he was talking...

01:20:19.456 --> 01:20:21.651
or you were reading his mind.

01:20:24.061 --> 01:20:26.256
- Why don't we go see him?
- Who?

01:20:27.231 --> 01:20:29.028
Granddad and Grandma.

01:20:30.601 --> 01:20:32.933
Maybe they don't want us anyhow.

01:20:33.837 --> 01:20:35.862
You ever think about that?

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:44.741
They didn't like Dad's style.

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:49.413
And then after Mom died,
they stopped showing up.

01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.608
She really got a nice voice, though.

01:21:44.708 --> 01:21:47.643
She gets the right break,
she'll be here in a hurry.

01:21:49.847 --> 01:21:51.548
What year was that?

01:21:51.648 --> 01:21:54.446
That was just last year
that this picture was taken.

01:22:06.697 --> 01:22:09.894
Her brother is a corporate airplane pilot.

01:22:11.368 --> 01:22:13.802
She's 16 and he's about 19. So young.

01:22:15.205 --> 01:22:18.542
You love to see young people
like that do so well...

01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:21.445
because a lot of them don't.

01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:24.673
<i>I did, too. I used to have two...</i>

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:40.888
Tim!

01:22:48.372 --> 01:22:49.737
Scoot over.

01:22:56.213 --> 01:22:59.011
This is medicine for intestinal problems.

01:23:09.426 --> 01:23:11.223
Can you hold it down?

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:16.624
Make you better.

01:23:21.238 --> 01:23:23.807
I'm thinking
we should stay here for a while.

01:23:23.907 --> 01:23:26.137
Just until you get a little better, okay?

01:23:27.144 --> 01:23:29.635
Until your medicine starts working.

01:23:31.248 --> 01:23:33.216
What does it taste like?

01:23:34.184 --> 01:23:36.253
You're getting weak.

01:23:36.353 --> 01:23:38.878
If you get weak, you got to tell me.

01:23:39.356 --> 01:23:41.085
How's that now?

01:23:45.128 --> 01:23:46.595
Is it good?

01:23:49.366 --> 01:23:51.391
It's Deel. Move.

01:23:52.035 --> 01:23:53.332
This way!

01:23:55.606 --> 01:23:57.471
God damn it. Chris!

01:24:03.714 --> 01:24:07.241
Why don't you boys come out
and let me look at you?

01:24:10.153 --> 01:24:11.916
We're family, right?

01:24:13.123 --> 01:24:15.455
Family looks after each other.

01:24:16.827 --> 01:24:18.590
Protects each other.

01:24:23.534 --> 01:24:25.729
They even forgive each other.

01:24:37.748 --> 01:24:40.342
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

01:24:58.435 --> 01:24:59.595
Chris!

01:25:13.283 --> 01:25:16.275
Chris, look what you're putting
Tim through.

01:25:17.254 --> 01:25:19.119
Running him around.

01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:23.426
Let's stop all this.

01:26:18.782 --> 01:26:20.875
<i>I was thinking about Dad...</i>

01:26:22.285 --> 01:26:24.253
<i>how he spoke to us...</i>

01:26:25.589 --> 01:26:27.648
<i>like he was afraid.</i>

01:26:30.093 --> 01:26:32.459
When he looked me in the eye...

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.799
sometimes...

01:26:39.836 --> 01:26:42.464
I believe he had no idea who I was.

01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:48.268
Or didn't care.

01:26:50.847 --> 01:26:52.474
<i>Who was this kid?</i>

01:26:54.685 --> 01:26:56.710
<i>How did he spring from me?</i>

01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:09.130
<i>I like the questions you ask yourself.</i>

01:27:25.148 --> 01:27:26.809
It's my money.

01:27:40.263 --> 01:27:42.366
- Violet, are you okay?
- I am.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:45.526
He's an asshole.
Can we please get out of here?

01:27:51.908 --> 01:27:53.808
- You're bleeding.
- Yeah.

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:07.517
Thanks.

01:28:55.438 --> 01:28:56.803
That's Gus.

01:28:58.809 --> 01:29:00.071
Hey, Gus.

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:02.436
Hey.

01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:09.082
I want, like, a thousand babies.

01:29:10.287 --> 01:29:14.057
A whole force of them, so that you're a team
and when you walk anywhere...

01:29:14.157 --> 01:29:17.058
people always have
to pay attention to you.

01:29:17.561 --> 01:29:20.655
<i>But maybe some more boys
than girls, because...</i>

01:29:46.957 --> 01:29:48.686
Where are you from?

01:29:50.927 --> 01:29:52.155
Nowhere.

01:30:03.473 --> 01:30:05.373
He's not doing so good.

01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:10.674
He'll fight it off.

01:30:11.648 --> 01:30:13.172
He always does.

01:30:14.818 --> 01:30:15.910
Here.

01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:42.742
You got something to write with?

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:50.342
I met this gypsy once.

01:30:55.358 --> 01:30:58.395
She told me that you write down a wish.

01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:02.693
Like whatever you want most in the world.
You write it down.

01:31:07.938 --> 01:31:09.030
Here.

01:31:13.476 --> 01:31:15.774
Don't tell me what it is, okay?

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.088
Then you put it in here.

01:31:27.991 --> 01:31:29.720
Don't look at mine.

01:31:33.463 --> 01:31:34.987
Put it in here.

01:31:41.771 --> 01:31:43.500
You see this river?

01:31:44.441 --> 01:31:46.238
It goes to the ocean.

01:31:46.343 --> 01:31:49.403
And so you throw your bottle in the ocean.

01:31:49.512 --> 01:31:51.514
Well, you don't,
you throw it in the river...

01:31:51.614 --> 01:31:55.516
and if it makes it all the way to the ocean,
then everything comes true.

01:31:57.287 --> 01:31:58.722
But a lot can go wrong...

01:31:58.822 --> 01:32:02.758
because it could just get pulled down.

01:32:03.994 --> 01:32:06.189
Something could pull it down.

01:32:59.716 --> 01:33:01.445
Have you seen them?

01:33:01.851 --> 01:33:05.446
- I ain't seen them.
- I'll make it worth your while.

01:33:16.332 --> 01:33:18.459
Where did you get that book?

01:33:22.672 --> 01:33:23.764
Well?

01:34:39.716 --> 01:34:43.413
Your bag is right there,
if that's what you're looking for.

01:35:00.904 --> 01:35:02.633
What are you doing?

01:35:05.108 --> 01:35:07.099
Those belonged to my dad.

01:35:07.443 --> 01:35:09.206
They're worth a lot.

01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:12.274
I figured you could use them.

01:35:22.692 --> 01:35:24.717
I ain't got nowhere to go.

01:35:27.997 --> 01:35:30.898
No one to be with me. See?

01:35:35.205 --> 01:35:37.537
Where did you say you were from?

01:35:55.758 --> 01:35:58.595
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again, Chris.

01:35:58.695 --> 01:36:00.890
Gather up them coins, boy.

01:36:01.497 --> 01:36:02.657
Do it.

01:36:03.266 --> 01:36:06.633
- I said gather up them coins, boy.
- I ain't your boy.

01:36:08.238 --> 01:36:09.933
You know, Chris...

01:36:12.675 --> 01:36:14.911
your ma and me, we had
some beautiful good times.

01:36:15.011 --> 01:36:18.648
- Don't talk about her.
- We had some beautiful nights, boy.

01:36:18.748 --> 01:36:21.683
And you were gonna be
our gift to each other.

01:36:23.186 --> 01:36:24.487
You don't know nothing!

01:36:24.587 --> 01:36:29.024
I know your daddy, that stranger
he always saw in you, Chris...

01:36:30.059 --> 01:36:32.323
was because you weren't his.

01:36:32.862 --> 01:36:36.491
You're my seed, and he had no right.
No right at all.

01:36:37.767 --> 01:36:41.304
Now, let's take them coins
and let's start over, just you and me.

01:36:41.404 --> 01:36:42.564
Chris!

01:36:48.711 --> 01:36:49.973
Come on.

01:36:53.716 --> 01:36:55.547
Tim!

01:36:56.619 --> 01:36:58.052
Come on.

01:37:09.198 --> 01:37:10.790
Come one, Tim!

01:37:12.001 --> 01:37:13.161
Run!

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.652
Wait!

01:37:41.264 --> 01:37:43.433
Are you okay? Come on!

01:37:43.533 --> 01:37:45.001
<i>- I can't.
- He can't. He's too...</i>

01:37:45.101 --> 01:37:47.501
You have to keep up. Now go.

01:37:48.037 --> 01:37:49.265
- Come on.
- Hide!

01:38:04.287 --> 01:38:06.721
Here, stay down, okay? Keep still.

01:38:07.557 --> 01:38:08.819
I'll get help.

01:38:10.093 --> 01:38:11.321
Come on.

01:38:14.797 --> 01:38:16.389
You want this?

01:38:22.038 --> 01:38:24.302
Just hand them to me, Chris.

01:38:25.675 --> 01:38:27.370
Nobody gets them.

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:38.911
<i>Frickin'...</i>

01:41:35.031 --> 01:41:36.931
<i>I used to get confused.</i>

01:41:38.768 --> 01:41:43.364
<i>I used to get confused
where things begin and when they end.</i>

01:41:44.607 --> 01:41:47.007
<i>Or what happens before and after.</i>

01:41:49.612 --> 01:41:51.512
<i>What about Mom and Dad?</i>

01:41:52.148 --> 01:41:53.816
<i>Did they cross the river?</i>

01:41:53.916 --> 01:41:55.907
<i>Are they watching us now?</i>

01:41:56.752 --> 01:41:58.344
<i>Where will I go?</i>

01:42:01.691 --> 01:42:04.421
<i>Sometimes I wonder if I'm superstitious.</i>

01:42:05.161 --> 01:42:09.427
<i>Do I believe in broken mirrors,
demons, and curses?</i>

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:14.195
<i>Because sometimes, it's a comfort.</i>

01:42:16.472 --> 01:42:18.201
<i>Everything is okay.</i>

01:42:20.710 --> 01:42:22.678
<i>You're safe with us now.</i>

01:42:31.721 --> 01:42:33.052
<i>Grandpa...</i>

01:42:34.590 --> 01:42:35.955
<i>he's awake.</i>

01:42:43.699 --> 01:42:45.667
You're safe with us now.

01:42:48.537 --> 01:42:51.597
The doctor said
you almost could have drowned.

01:42:58.447 --> 01:43:01.177
- How you feel?
- Coins.

01:43:03.953 --> 01:43:05.750
- Coins.
- You cold?
