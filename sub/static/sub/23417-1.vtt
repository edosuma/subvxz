01:40.257 --> 01:42.418
Hemmings!

01:42.492 --> 01:45.620
Sam, I told you to close up shop
and be ready to move off
the island by nightfall.

01:45.695 --> 01:47.595
- Yes, Captain Brynner, but--
- But what?

01:47.664 --> 01:50.895
Can't I go to the loading dock
for a few hours without coming
back to find a major screwup?

01:50.967 --> 01:54.596
With all due respect,
Dr. Long told me to prep the field
for detonation at noon.

01:54.671 --> 01:57.697
Jesus Ch-- We're on a very
slippery slope here, Sam.

01:57.774 --> 02:01.369
A covert military operation
riddled with civilian scientists.

02:01.444 --> 02:05.210
You don't think it's that bad?
Long spent the last two years
developing his defoliant.

02:05.282 --> 02:07.216
The stuff can't even kill
crabgrass yet.

02:07.284 --> 02:12.051
- Where's their protective gear?
- It's 100 degrees out here.
  The guys deserve a break.

02:12.122 --> 02:16.115
They'll get a break tomorrow.
I'm not gonna take chances
on our last day.

02:59.602 --> 03:03.129
Doc, what's up?
I thought we wrapped
the tests yesterday.

03:03.206 --> 03:08.610
Captain Brynner is gonna shit if
he finds out we haven't closed up shop.

03:08.678 --> 03:11.408
I had something of an epiphany
this morning, Telstar.

03:11.481 --> 03:16.282
I eliminated the binary shell,
and I grafted the cobaltion
to the other side of the molecule.

03:16.353 --> 03:19.550
I think it might give us a significantly
more rapid chemical ignition.

03:20.623 --> 03:22.557
It better.

03:25.462 --> 03:27.089
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?

03:27.163 --> 03:30.655
Well, Costello's finished
with the stability profile...

03:30.734 --> 03:33.862
but Abbott is still chewing
on the load file.

03:33.937 --> 03:37.896
So reaction temperature is 50 degrees.
Your prediction was on the nose.

03:37.974 --> 03:40.568
How much longer
for the range and power projections?

03:40.643 --> 03:42.736
I don't know.

03:42.812 --> 03:46.748
Uh, he's working, but there's a lot
of data. Maybe another hour.

03:46.816 --> 03:49.614
We don't have an hour.
We're already supposed to be shut down.

04:04.434 --> 04:06.368
Dr. Long.

04:06.436 --> 04:08.734
What the hell's all this about
a detonation today?

04:08.805 --> 04:10.830
We're scheduled to be
off the island tonight.

04:10.907 --> 04:12.397
I changed the schedule.

04:12.475 --> 04:14.841
I don't work for you,
Captain Brynner.

04:14.911 --> 04:19.108
Sweeney tells me you don't have
computer confirmation.

04:19.182 --> 04:24.017
You know, Captain, if you hadn't
spent so much of your career
questioning your superiors,

04:24.087 --> 04:26.021
you might've found yourself
with more gold leaf on your collar.

04:26.089 --> 04:28.717
This isn't some kind
of pissing contest, Long.

04:28.792 --> 04:32.853
You may be in charge here, but those men
out there are my responsibility.

04:32.929 --> 04:36.456
Look, this is
a scientific experiment, okay?

04:36.533 --> 04:39.468
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon
will go up along with mine.

04:39.536 --> 04:41.800
I don't think I need to mention
you could use the help.

04:41.871 --> 04:44.305
The N.S.A. thinks
the U.N. is onto your work.

04:44.374 --> 04:47.104
The White House is screaming
about chemical weapons,

04:47.177 --> 04:49.839
and we're sittin' here
with our hands in the cookie jar.

04:49.913 --> 04:53.314
Let me tell you something else.
I didn't join the service
to let people like you...

04:53.383 --> 04:55.908
turn the United States into the kind
of country we're supposed to be--

04:55.985 --> 04:58.419
But you have no choice
but to follow orders.

04:58.488 --> 05:01.252
Now listen to me.

05:01.324 --> 05:04.760
I know you have moral objections
to what we're doing here,

05:04.828 --> 05:07.388
but, believe me, if I thought there was
any real danger, I wouldn't go forward.

05:07.464 --> 05:09.796
You have my word on that.

05:11.768 --> 05:17.502
All right. One more shot, provided
we're off the island tonight.

05:20.510 --> 05:22.671
Let's proceed.

05:24.614 --> 05:28.914
Ladies and gentlemen,
Elvis is approaching the stage.

05:32.455 --> 05:35.015
Safe distance-- 200 yards.

05:35.091 --> 05:37.787
And make sure
Hemmings hears you say it.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.175
Two hundred yards, Hemmings.
D minus five.

05:55.411 --> 05:57.845
All right,
we're movin' out, men.

06:02.785 --> 06:05.345
Hold it.
Get closer together.

07:40.116 --> 07:43.051
Jesus. Dr. Long!

07:44.654 --> 07:47.487
I got 8,000 yards.
Radius is five miles.

07:47.557 --> 07:49.650
- What?
- Long, what the hell?

07:49.726 --> 07:52.388
Abbott's predicting the effective
detonation radius is five miles.

07:52.462 --> 07:55.761
That's the entire island. We've gotta
shut it down. We gotta shut it down.

08:22.992 --> 08:27.691
Oh, my God.
"I am become Death,

08:27.764 --> 08:30.324
the destroyer of worlds."

08:30.400 --> 08:33.927
No! No!
You'll kill us all!

08:34.003 --> 08:37.268
Damn you, Long.
My people, your people are out there.

08:37.340 --> 08:38.967
It's too late. It's too late.

09:09.772 --> 09:11.433
Let me in!

09:11.474 --> 09:15.410
Captain Andrew Thomas Brynner, it is
the opinion of this review panel...

09:15.478 --> 09:18.003
that the verdict delivered
in this case is justified...

09:18.081 --> 09:20.879
and that you are, in fact,
guilty of criminal negligence,

09:20.950 --> 09:24.351
resulting in the deaths of 18 members
of a military research team...

09:24.420 --> 09:28.686
on the date of August 18, 1987.

09:28.758 --> 09:32.922
It is also this panel's opinion that
the sentence of reduction in rank,

09:32.995 --> 09:35.293
for feiture of all pay
and allowances...

09:35.364 --> 09:39.892
and ten years in the United States
disciplinary command
at Fort Leavenworth...

09:39.969 --> 09:41.903
is justified.

09:41.971 --> 09:44.496
Furthermore, you are advised
that while you are a prisoner,

09:44.574 --> 09:47.907
you remain bound by the
National Security Act of 1947.

09:47.977 --> 09:50.810
If you divulge
classified information...

09:50.880 --> 09:53.713
or discuss the nature of the project
in which you were involved,

09:53.783 --> 09:57.184
you will face
further prosecution.

09:57.253 --> 10:00.279
Do you understand?

10:00.356 --> 10:03.291
I assume your silence
indicates assent.

10:05.128 --> 10:09.394
Transfer to Leavenworth will be
immediate. You're dismissed.

10:14.804 --> 10:18.934
Andrew, I wish they would've let me
say something about--

10:19.008 --> 10:23.945
There's nothing to say, Doctor.
Someone had to take the fall,
and they still need you,

10:24.013 --> 10:28.450
whereas I've never been anything
more than a thorn in their
collective side, as you said.

10:28.518 --> 10:34.423
So I'll be locked safely away
in some hole along with my secret sins.

10:35.491 --> 10:37.425
And yours.

11:26.342 --> 11:28.105
Ready?

12:01.544 --> 12:05.344
- Been tryin' to figure out your secret.
- My secret?

12:05.414 --> 12:10.647
Yeah. Ten months, we've been fishing
this river together.

12:10.720 --> 12:15.316
We use the same equipment
but you pull twice as many fish
out of the water as I do.

12:15.391 --> 12:18.724
And I'm good at this,

12:18.794 --> 12:22.321
been doin' it since I was a kid.

12:22.398 --> 12:27.097
But you, I don't know.
Somehow you think like a fish.

12:27.169 --> 12:30.605
No, that's not possible, Mason.
The trout...

12:30.673 --> 12:35.701
is a perfect hunter,
the master of his realm.

12:35.778 --> 12:39.908
How can we ever hope to win
against the trout?

12:41.417 --> 12:44.909
There's only one way
you can do it, Mason:

12:44.987 --> 12:47.455
Turn the power of the hunter
against him.

12:49.425 --> 12:53.885
Tie a fly, create a piece of bait
that sends the fish's instincts
into overdrive,

12:53.963 --> 12:56.090
forcing him to strike,
and only then...

12:56.165 --> 13:00.124
does our noble friend realize
that the prey can bite back.

13:03.506 --> 13:08.239
And that power,
without caution, is death.

13:12.381 --> 13:16.579
Some people might say
you're readin' an awful lot
into a simple thing like fishin'.

13:16.652 --> 13:20.918
Some people might,
but I don't think you would.

13:54.557 --> 13:57.253
He's here.

13:57.326 --> 13:59.419
It's about time.

14:43.239 --> 14:45.173
We all know
what we have to do.

14:47.576 --> 14:50.067
So let's do it.

15:07.263 --> 15:11.495
* The lone wolf
I'll always be*

15:11.567 --> 15:14.468
* The black sheep
of the family*

15:14.537 --> 15:18.371
* Passin' through places
that I've been*

15:21.944 --> 15:24.071
- Wait up.
- Goddamn it, Mason.

15:24.146 --> 15:28.276
Of all the days
for you to show up late.

15:28.350 --> 15:32.184
First, the idiot April calls in sick,
then I got a bad tooth...

15:32.254 --> 15:34.722
and then my night man shows up
when he feels like it.

15:34.790 --> 15:38.658
Darlene, it's 5:30. Now, I worked late
for you this morning,

15:38.727 --> 15:41.560
and you didn't want to spring
for overtime, remember?

15:41.630 --> 15:45.361
Oh. Well, I have got to get
to the dentist before he closes,

15:45.434 --> 15:47.664
which means you're gonna
have to cover the grill and the floor.

15:47.736 --> 15:50.204
- I can handle it.
- Mm, it doesn't take a genius.

15:50.272 --> 15:55.073
Well, how'd we do today, Doc?

15:55.144 --> 15:58.011
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.277
Story of my life.

16:01.350 --> 16:04.786
Well, one thing you won't lose
is that friend of yours back there.

16:04.854 --> 16:06.788
- I'll tell you that.
- Oh, no?

16:06.856 --> 16:11.259
You're two of a kind, Doc.
He may not have your sheep skins,

16:11.327 --> 16:15.286
and, well, most of the time,
he looks like something
the cat might have dragged in,

16:15.364 --> 16:19.095
but he's smart enough
to get you somehow.

16:19.168 --> 16:21.329
There's something else too.

16:21.403 --> 16:24.270
Uh, we both like to fish.

16:25.341 --> 16:27.275
- Secrets.
- Ah.

16:27.343 --> 16:31.837
His, I know.
Yours, I don't have a clue.

16:31.914 --> 16:35.077
But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd
have drifted right on through this town.

16:35.151 --> 16:37.142
You know,

16:37.219 --> 16:40.313
I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee
and a meal in this place, Darlene?

16:41.724 --> 16:43.658
And you ain't gonna start now.

16:45.661 --> 16:47.185
- Mason!
- Yeah?

16:47.263 --> 16:49.288
Be sure you feed Bosco.

16:49.365 --> 16:54.393
And don't give him any ice cream,
like April. It gives him gas.

16:54.470 --> 16:56.768
And make sure there's two pots
of coffee ready--

16:56.839 --> 16:58.830
- Before the morning crowd blows in.
- I got it, Darlene.

17:17.660 --> 17:20.992
- Is this stool taken?
- No. Go--

17:22.565 --> 17:27.695
You look good, Richard.
You look fit, healthy.

17:27.770 --> 17:31.968
Not at all like a man responsible
for the deaths of 18 people.

17:34.443 --> 17:39.244
Is that why you're here? To blame me?
You could've saved yourself the trip.

17:39.315 --> 17:43.274
I know where the blame belongs.

17:43.352 --> 17:45.752
But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.
The government did.

17:45.821 --> 17:51.316
Oh, I'm well aware of what
the government did, I assure you.

17:51.393 --> 17:56.490
Actually, I just come to say how
grateful I am to you and the government.

17:56.565 --> 17:58.499
- Grateful?
- Mm-hmm.

17:58.567 --> 18:02.264
Together, you gave me
the opportunity to realize...

18:02.338 --> 18:05.034
just how very wrong
my life had gone.

18:05.107 --> 18:08.838
Do you remember telling me once
that all through my career,

18:08.911 --> 18:10.845
I'd never fit in?

18:10.913 --> 18:14.781
Well, you were right, of course,

18:14.850 --> 18:17.080
but after years
of thinking the matter over,

18:17.152 --> 18:20.212
I began to see that the whole thing
wasn't really my problem.

18:20.289 --> 18:25.818
What rational man could fit in
with the sorts of things
our government was doing?

18:25.894 --> 18:30.456
The sorts of things
you've always done, Richard?

18:30.532 --> 18:34.059
Do you think I haven't seen
the bodies of those men
every time I've closed my eyes?

18:34.136 --> 18:36.764
- But after you went away--
- "Went away"?

18:37.840 --> 18:39.740
"Went away."
I like that.

18:39.808 --> 18:42.470
It's almost quaint.

18:43.879 --> 18:47.781
All right.
After they put you away,

18:47.850 --> 18:51.718
I began trying to find ways of
controlling the effects of the weapon...

18:51.787 --> 18:54.551
- that we tested on Horn Island.
- And let me guess-- you failed.

18:54.623 --> 18:57.421
So far, y-yes.

18:57.493 --> 19:02.556
Why is it you scientists can create
implements of destruction so quickly,

19:02.631 --> 19:06.465
but when it comes to cures
and benefits, your speedis
nothing short of glacial?

19:06.535 --> 19:09.060
Though at least
you're trying, Richard.

19:09.138 --> 19:11.766
And if the road to hellispaved
with good intentions,

19:11.840 --> 19:14.104
we know you'll find
your way there quickly.

19:14.176 --> 19:16.406
And don't worry.

19:16.478 --> 19:21.279
It's not such a bad place.
I should know, after all.

19:30.292 --> 19:32.658
Okay, Doc.

19:36.532 --> 19:38.830
The usual. Doc!

19:51.680 --> 19:54.012
- Good morning, Dr. Long.
- Hi.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.327
Morning, Doc.
Awful early, aren't ya?

20:15.404 --> 20:18.862
Couldn't sleep, Pump.
Is everything all right tonight?

20:18.941 --> 20:21.466
There's nothin' goin' on
out there, Doc,

20:21.543 --> 20:23.977
except maybe the occasional
fly fisherman.

20:26.582 --> 20:29.073
Hey, Doc.

20:29.151 --> 20:31.745
Might wanna try
this one out sometime.

20:31.820 --> 20:34.755
Nice one.

20:47.503 --> 20:50.404
Colonel Brynner.
I got an appointment to see Dr. Long.

20:50.472 --> 20:52.531
Can I see some I.D., sir?

21:01.483 --> 21:04.714
Video lock.
You got 30 minutes.

22:29.137 --> 22:31.162
Forget about him.

22:32.908 --> 22:35.775
Let's find the prize.

22:40.949 --> 22:43.213
Vaughn.

22:47.789 --> 22:50.349
We're in.

22:55.397 --> 22:57.558
This is it.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.315
Yeah!

24:23.151 --> 24:26.917
Do you work for my boss, dog?
Okay. Okay.

24:26.989 --> 24:29.651
Okay, okay.

24:31.126 --> 24:35.153
At least somebody likes this shit.

24:50.412 --> 24:53.438
- Mornin'.
- Little early for a delivery.

24:53.515 --> 24:55.608
Yeah, I'm tryin' to get most of my day
done before it hits 90.

24:55.684 --> 24:58.949
- Where's Sam?
- Sam?

24:59.021 --> 25:02.855
Andy gave Sam a nice big desk
to park his fat ass behind.

25:02.924 --> 25:05.449
- Where do you want this stuff?
- Freezer in the back.

25:09.598 --> 25:13.193
- Art.
- Mornin', Mason. Two large
coffees to go, okay?

25:13.268 --> 25:15.202
All right.

25:16.972 --> 25:20.703
So, Mason, last Wednesday night,
uh, were you out, uh,

25:20.776 --> 25:24.837
drifting around like the trash you are,
or were you here working?

25:24.913 --> 25:27.177
If it was Wednesday night,
I was working.

25:27.249 --> 25:30.776
- You recognize this young man?
- Nope. Is there a problem?

25:30.852 --> 25:35.380
You find yourself wearing a badge
someday, then you can ask the questions.

25:35.457 --> 25:38.119
Until then, you answer mine,
got that?

25:38.193 --> 25:42.220
So you don't remember selling
this young man beer Wednesday night?

25:42.297 --> 25:46.324
I don't sell beer to minors.
I take that kind of thing seriously.

25:46.401 --> 25:49.666
- That's not the way I hear it.
Matter of fact--
- Take it easy, Pappas.

25:49.738 --> 25:54.698
- Mason, this boy says you did
sell him beer that night.
- Yeah? Well, he's lyin'.

25:54.776 --> 25:58.542
Lying? Mason, you wouldn't
know the truth if it bit you.

25:58.613 --> 26:00.547
We've got your whole record.

26:00.615 --> 26:04.915
We know about the conviction
for vagrancy, public drunkenness.

26:04.986 --> 26:09.047
- I didn't sell the boy any beer.
-Shut your mouth
until I tell you to talk, son.

26:09.124 --> 26:12.025
You know, I gotta tell you. That really
bothers me-- somebody calls me "son."

26:12.094 --> 26:14.995
Then how about
if I call you "asshole"?

26:15.063 --> 26:17.861
All right, both of you,
just cool off.

26:17.933 --> 26:21.369
Look, Mason, maybe the kid
showed you a fake I.D.,
or you forgot to check.

26:21.436 --> 26:24.098
I didn't forget to check,
and I know how to spot a fake I.D.,

26:24.172 --> 26:27.801
especially from a little geek
like that kid.

26:27.876 --> 26:30.606
That little geek is my son.

26:30.679 --> 26:33.170
All right.
Enough. Look.

26:33.248 --> 26:35.876
Mason, I don't wanna hear
about you sellin' alcohol
to minors.

26:35.951 --> 26:39.853
- I didn't sell any alcohol--
- I'm not sayin' you did.
Just don't, okay?

26:39.921 --> 26:43.914
You make sure you keep your nose clean,
we won't have any problems.

26:43.992 --> 26:46.552
Let's go, Pappas.

26:48.697 --> 26:51.530
- I said, let's go.
- You got a problem too?

26:51.600 --> 26:54.899
No, sir. I've never seen
this guy before.

27:01.643 --> 27:05.135
Sure as hell met a few assholes
like that, though.

27:11.853 --> 27:15.516
- You gotta learn to lighten up
when the man's in your face.
- That's my business.

27:15.590 --> 27:18.718
- No argument there.
- Guy's a fuckin' moron.

27:18.794 --> 27:23.424
Hey, I'm with you on that one,
my man. Prick.

27:23.498 --> 27:27.059
Look, you need me to sign
an invoice or somethin'?

27:27.135 --> 27:32.334
Uh, between this month and last month,
you owe $417. And we need that in cash.

27:32.407 --> 27:35.604
Since when does Darlene
pay you in cash?

27:35.677 --> 27:37.611
Since today. New policy.

27:37.679 --> 27:40.648
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything
about it to me,

27:40.715 --> 27:43.445
so tell Andy to bill her like usual,
and let them sort it out.

27:43.518 --> 27:45.110
Move.

27:45.187 --> 27:47.951
Well, he told me
to collect cash.

27:49.224 --> 27:52.318
- Andy-- another fuckin' moron.
- Hey.

27:52.394 --> 27:55.955
You and I are seein' eye to eye
on a whole range of issues this mornin'.

27:56.031 --> 27:58.795
Uh-huh?

28:00.068 --> 28:02.969
Except for the fact
that I need cash.

28:03.038 --> 28:06.906
- He could've called first.
- He could've. That's true.

28:06.975 --> 28:09.637
But that would've been
smart and fair.

28:09.711 --> 28:14.842
Two things Andy is not.
But I tell you what.

28:14.916 --> 28:18.477
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you
ten percent off.

28:18.553 --> 28:23.547
Say, uh, 375, seein' that we both have
so much love for Andy.

28:23.625 --> 28:26.355
I'll tell him I lost a few cartons
comin' over the mountain.

28:26.428 --> 28:29.295
That'll make up
the difference, huh? Huh?

28:29.364 --> 28:33.130
Well, Darlene usually gives me
a signed check for emergencies.
I could always give you that.

28:33.201 --> 28:35.169
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait.

28:35.237 --> 28:39.071
Night Shift, see?
A check is not cash.

28:39.140 --> 28:42.166
Cash got a whole lot of numbers
on it, pictures of old white men
with messed-up hairdos.

28:42.244 --> 28:44.872
That's what I need.

28:44.946 --> 28:48.939
All right, all right.
I'll go you one better:

28:49.017 --> 28:53.181
275, and I'll tell him you'll make up
the balance next month, huh?

28:55.891 --> 28:57.825
Doc!

28:59.394 --> 29:03.091
- Oh, oh, Jesus.
- Wait. Hang on.

29:03.164 --> 29:06.156
- What the--
- Shit! Oh, shit.

29:08.303 --> 29:13.104
- Is that his truck?
- Yeah, that's my truck.

29:13.174 --> 29:18.908
Mason, you have to take this
to Fort McGruder in his truck.

29:18.980 --> 29:21.915
Wait. This town is full of trucks.
Nice new trucks.

29:21.983 --> 29:24.417
- You don't need to go take my sorry--
- We need your truck.

29:24.486 --> 29:27.614
- Call an ambulance.
- Mason, no. There's no time.

29:34.696 --> 29:36.527
I don't see it.

29:36.598 --> 29:39.465
Turn around at the gas station.
Look behind the buildings.

29:39.534 --> 29:42.560
So you called
the damn thing "Elvis"?

29:42.637 --> 29:46.471
I had no idea how powerful it was.

29:46.541 --> 29:50.739
Eighteen men were killed
in seconds...

29:50.812 --> 29:54.805
with just a fraction of what's here.

29:54.883 --> 29:57.443
Mason.

29:57.519 --> 30:00.488
And now the man who did this,
he's-- he's coming after it.

30:00.555 --> 30:03.115
You can't let him have it.

30:03.191 --> 30:08.788
- You have-- have toget it
to McGruder.
- Hey.

30:08.863 --> 30:11.491
Hey, Night Shift.

30:11.566 --> 30:14.057
Why don't you make it $150.
We'll call it a day.

30:24.245 --> 30:28.511
- There.
- Check it out.

30:35.890 --> 30:38.654
Carl, the main phone junction.

30:38.727 --> 30:41.855
Move. This is already
affecting our schedule.

30:41.930 --> 30:46.094
Dennis, radio the bikes.
I wanna know if so much as
a squirrel comes up that road.

30:46.167 --> 30:48.101
Yes, sir.

30:51.373 --> 30:54.501
The compound has to be kept cold,

30:54.576 --> 30:57.170
or it'll ignite.

30:57.245 --> 30:59.179
Cold? Cold. How cold?

30:59.247 --> 31:03.513
Never let it reach 50 degrees.

31:03.585 --> 31:05.610
And what if it does?

31:05.687 --> 31:08.212
Everything will die, Mason.

31:08.289 --> 31:13.659
In seconds, everything
for hundreds of miles.

31:13.728 --> 31:16.196
That's why you need his truck.

31:16.264 --> 31:18.892
Mason.

31:34.149 --> 31:36.208
It's clean.

31:36.818 --> 31:38.046
Check the immediate area.

31:38.119 --> 31:41.179
This was supposed to be
a quick in and out.

31:41.256 --> 31:43.588
You have ten percent
of 100 million dollars comin' your way.

31:43.658 --> 31:46.923
I think we can impose on you
for a little overtime.

31:48.563 --> 31:52.090
You're the only one I can trust.

31:52.167 --> 31:55.762
The only one who understands...

31:55.837 --> 32:00.968
what this m-means, Mason, Mason.

32:01.042 --> 32:06.412
Doc! Doc, wait.
Doc, wait.

32:06.481 --> 32:09.541
Wait, Doc.

32:09.617 --> 32:12.450
No! No!

32:18.359 --> 32:20.691
Sorry, man, he's dead.

32:20.762 --> 32:24.994
It's after 5:00, sir.
Our satellite link is on schedule.
Should I start the feed?

32:25.066 --> 32:29.730
Get'em on line, then stall.
Long can't have gotten far.

32:29.804 --> 32:33.205
- Closin' down, sir.
- Vaughn, Burke,
move to the end of the street.

32:33.274 --> 32:35.208
Fan out and work your way
back to the motel.

32:36.578 --> 32:38.512
We gotta get help.

32:39.981 --> 32:43.075
Aw, fuck! It's dead.

33:13.581 --> 33:16.243
- Mornin'.
- Is this your establishment?

33:16.317 --> 33:19.286
Yeah, they call me Darlene.

33:19.354 --> 33:21.948
Well, then, how about
a cup of coffee, Darlene?

33:22.023 --> 33:25.515
- Iced coffee.
- I assume you want that to go.

33:25.593 --> 33:28.494
Assumptions are always dangerous.

33:31.499 --> 33:34.764
- That's quite a get up for jacking deer.
- I beg your pardon.

33:34.836 --> 33:36.997
You wanna hunt outta season,
it's cool with me.

33:37.071 --> 33:41.804
But most people, they just take a six
and a rifle. You, on the other hand,

33:43.745 --> 33:45.679
look like you're after
something more dangerous.

33:45.747 --> 33:49.410
Actually, I was just looking
for a restroom. I assume you have one.

33:49.484 --> 33:53.181
Assumptions are always dangerous.

33:55.089 --> 33:57.387
There is one in the back.

34:07.068 --> 34:10.299
Hey.
Hey, be cool.

34:10.371 --> 34:12.396
Be-- Be--

34:21.616 --> 34:24.016
That was quick.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.750
To tell you the truth,
we're looking for a scientist...

34:28.822 --> 34:30.757
who's gone missing
from the tech center.

34:30.824 --> 34:33.521
Maybe you know him--
Richard Long.

34:35.630 --> 34:40.158
- We're worried about him.
- I'll keep an eye out.

34:40.235 --> 34:44.763
Doc Long. Doc Long.
Yeah, I know him. Weird old guy.

34:44.839 --> 34:47.739
He comes in from time to time, yeah.
Not tonight, though.

34:50.844 --> 34:53.005
Odd, then, that his car
should be right outside.

34:53.081 --> 34:55.275
Like I say,
Doc Long's an odd guy.

35:20.541 --> 35:22.771
Say, General.

35:24.178 --> 35:26.203
That'll be 50 cents for the coffee.

35:52.040 --> 35:53.974
What did I say?

35:54.042 --> 35:57.136
Dude in a uniform get in your face,
you do not shout your mouth off.

35:57.211 --> 35:59.406
I need your truck.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.643
No, no, no, you don't need my truck.
You need somebody else's truck...

36:02.717 --> 36:04.651
and a shit load ofice.

36:04.719 --> 36:08.917
If I don't get this to McGruder,
it's good-bye Andy's Ice Cream,
good-bye Montana.

36:08.990 --> 36:11.959
Wait, man. You don't believe
the dead guy, do you?

36:12.026 --> 36:13.994
Yeah, I believe him.
He was my friend.

36:14.062 --> 36:16.929
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

36:16.998 --> 36:19.933
Hey, listen,
you know what I think?

36:20.001 --> 36:23.232
I think he's a wacko, and I think
that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.

36:23.304 --> 36:27.206
And I think you're the biggest
wacko of all, wantin' to be
a part this wacko shit.

36:27.275 --> 36:29.607
I need your help.

36:29.677 --> 36:33.875
- You are mistaken if you think
you're goin' anywhere in my truck.
- Then you drive me to McGruder.

36:33.948 --> 36:37.850
Look, I got two tons of the world's
nastiest ice cream...

36:37.919 --> 36:40.149
sittin' in a truck that should've been
retired ten years ago.

36:40.221 --> 36:42.155
That shit will be worthless
by noon.

36:42.223 --> 36:44.817
- Oh, man.
- And if that Elvis shit...

36:44.892 --> 36:49.989
is as dangerous as you seem
to think it is, I'm gettin'
my ass as far away as possible.

36:50.064 --> 36:51.554
- Peace.
- Fine.

36:51.632 --> 36:54.624
- Slap the red off his neck.
Ain't gonna take my truck.
- Wait, hold up.

36:54.702 --> 36:57.364
Look. You want cash?
You want cash?

36:57.438 --> 36:59.406
I got like, uh--

36:59.474 --> 37:03.342
I got, uh-- I got 50 bucks.
I'll get more.

37:03.411 --> 37:07.211
I'll rent the truck from you.
You can go, you can stay here.
Whatever you want.

37:07.281 --> 37:08.305
No.

37:10.485 --> 37:14.979
- Then how about this?
- Hey, you're gonna piss me--
What the hell you doin'?

37:15.056 --> 37:18.685
- I need your truck.
- You are not takin' my truck!

37:20.895 --> 37:23.159
How far you got to go?

37:24.232 --> 37:26.291
Go.

37:26.367 --> 37:28.597
Move it. Go on.

37:28.669 --> 37:32.070
Goddamn it.
Would you hurry up?

37:32.140 --> 37:34.700
Now put this in the back.
Keep it safe.

37:40.681 --> 37:42.876
Come on, let's go.

37:42.950 --> 37:45.111
- Did you keep it safe?
- Yeah, I kept it safe.

37:47.688 --> 37:49.883
What the hell is with you, dog?
He's the one with the damn gun.

37:49.957 --> 37:52.517
- You gave him ice cream, didn't you?
Come on, let's go.
- To keep him off my ass.

37:52.593 --> 37:54.788
What'd you do that for?
It makes him mean as a snake.

37:54.862 --> 37:56.796
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.

37:56.864 --> 37:59.492
- Get in the truck. Shh!
- I will bust a mud hole in your ass.

37:59.567 --> 38:02.968
- Don't tell me to shush.
I can talk all I want to.
- Just shut up.

38:04.472 --> 38:06.804
- Are you kiddin'?

38:06.874 --> 38:09.138
Come on.

38:09.210 --> 38:11.303
- Damn.
- What the hell's goin' on?

38:11.379 --> 38:13.540
It happens to this piece of shit
all the time.

38:13.614 --> 38:15.707
Damn diesel injectors are flooded.

38:15.783 --> 38:19.719
- Excuse me, can you fix this?
- You wanna give me a minute?

38:19.787 --> 38:23.723
Well, if it's national security,
I guess it's okay.

38:26.661 --> 38:29.960
I just hope we don't bust in
on anybody...

38:30.031 --> 38:32.727
doing what people do in motels.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.131
Shit.

38:37.972 --> 38:41.931
Wait for me here, sir,
if you don't mind.

38:48.015 --> 38:50.950
Get in.

39:08.102 --> 39:10.036
Damn dog.

39:29.524 --> 39:31.458
Hey.

39:33.027 --> 39:34.961
Hey.

39:38.266 --> 39:41.064
Hey.

39:41.135 --> 39:43.535
Get back in the truck.

39:43.604 --> 39:47.734
You mean to tell me to get in the truck.
I'll kick your ass in a minute
if you play that.

39:56.918 --> 39:58.852
Better coast through town.

40:29.350 --> 40:32.217
We're clear.

40:32.286 --> 40:36.586
Whoo-hoo, there he is.

40:48.970 --> 40:50.904
Hold it, I hear something.

40:56.377 --> 41:00.040
- Get Brynner on the radio.
- Come in, command.
Truck just passed check point.

41:00.114 --> 41:01.741
Over.

41:04.318 --> 41:07.082
- Run that back.
- Let me enhance it.

41:10.291 --> 41:12.418
Print it.

41:18.532 --> 41:22.992
Sir, this transmission
just came in.

41:23.070 --> 41:28.303
Well, it appears
someone's been lying to us.

41:49.864 --> 41:52.526
Alert the bikes.

41:54.335 --> 41:58.203
- It's in the back of the truck.
You have a go.
- Roger, we're on it.

41:58.272 --> 42:02.971
Sir, all potential customers
have been informed of the delay.
Any further orders?

42:03.044 --> 42:06.673
So, a pair of average citizens
have decided...

42:06.747 --> 42:09.682
to risk their lives
for their country.

42:10.885 --> 42:14.286
I almost remember
what that feels like.

42:29.937 --> 42:32.167
No signal.

42:32.239 --> 42:35.140
Suppose you're gonna shoot me
because you can't get service
on my cell phone.

42:45.886 --> 42:48.980
Billings? No, no, no, no.
We need to go to McGruder.

42:50.491 --> 42:53.358
No, you gotta go
to McGruder.

42:53.427 --> 42:57.227
- No, no, no, no, no, we gotta go
to McGruder. I go where the truck goes.
- No.

42:57.298 --> 43:01.860
To get to McGruder,
you have to go through Missoula,
and I ain't goin' through Missoula.

43:01.936 --> 43:06.430
- No way.
We're goin' to McGruder.
- I ain't going through Missoula.

43:06.507 --> 43:09.374
Am I missin' somethin' here?

43:11.145 --> 43:14.603
Look, I kinda borrowed
the truck from Andy.

43:14.682 --> 43:16.843
- "Borrowed"?
- Yeah, borrowed!

43:16.917 --> 43:19.408
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!

43:19.487 --> 43:22.047
- I did not steal this truck.
- You stole this truck.

43:22.123 --> 43:24.284
That's what all the bullshit
about the cash was, wasn't it?

43:24.358 --> 43:27.156
You stole this truck, and now you're
tryin' to sell the ice cream for money.

43:27.228 --> 43:29.389
I didn't steal the truck!
He owed it to me!

43:29.463 --> 43:32.864
Anyway, the important thing is
I'm not goin' through Missoula.

43:32.933 --> 43:37.267
I don't give a shit if you go
through Missoula at 100 miles an
hour, we're goin' to McGruder.

43:37.338 --> 43:39.772
Remember, I still have this.

43:41.142 --> 43:43.201
Yeah, that's what I thought.

43:43.277 --> 43:46.075
I'm about to get in your ass
like last year's underwear, man.

43:46.147 --> 43:48.809
- That's fine. Whatever.
- I ain't playin' now.

44:08.936 --> 44:14.841
Hey. We can't push
old Pete in this heat. He can't take it.

44:14.909 --> 44:16.843
Fine.

44:43.170 --> 44:45.695
You better speed old Pete up.

44:51.846 --> 44:54.474
Pull over!

45:13.701 --> 45:17.193
- Holy shit. Goddamn.
- Okay, okay.

45:31.785 --> 45:34.185
One of 'em's in the back.

45:34.255 --> 45:38.316
- No, no, no, no, no. Keep going.
- Okay.

45:55.409 --> 45:59.004
- You're not goin' back there!
- Shut up!

46:00.414 --> 46:02.109
- Take your gun!
- Doesn't work.

46:02.182 --> 46:04.912
- What?
- Doesn't work. It's not even loaded.

46:04.985 --> 46:08.011
You mean to tell me you hijacked me
with an empty gun?

46:08.088 --> 46:11.057
- Yep.
- Hey.

46:11.125 --> 46:14.253
When this is all over,
remind me to kick your ass!

46:28.709 --> 46:30.768
Looks like our share just got bigger.

48:07.241 --> 48:09.175
Aw, shit.

48:10.244 --> 48:13.407
- Oh, shit.
- Help! Help!

48:19.219 --> 48:21.585
- No!
- Aw, shit.

48:30.597 --> 48:33.327
Get him to stand up,
Night Shift.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.595
Hey!

48:42.342 --> 48:46.278
Okay! All right!

49:06.100 --> 49:09.228
- So you're sure it was Mason?
- Positive.

49:09.303 --> 49:12.238
He came out of the store
with the ice cream guy.

49:12.306 --> 49:15.332
The men from the base,
they took off right after 'em.

49:15.409 --> 49:17.343
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

49:18.512 --> 49:22.107
Must've happened
right after we left.

49:22.182 --> 49:25.583
Missoula's reporting a refrigerator
truck as a stolen vehicle.

49:25.652 --> 49:27.586
I told you Mason was walking shit.

49:27.654 --> 49:30.487
Pappas, that other guy was unloading
ice cream into a freezer.

49:30.557 --> 49:33.287
Now what could he have to do
with a military scientist, huh?

49:33.360 --> 49:37.421
The sooner you get up to the lab,
the sooner you'll figure it out.

49:37.498 --> 49:41.298
- And where are you goin'?
- After that refrigerator truck.

49:51.044 --> 49:53.979
- Elvis is on ice again.
- Okay.

49:54.047 --> 49:56.845
Nice job back there.

49:56.917 --> 49:59.613
Hey, don't give me
that "nice job" shit, man.

49:59.686 --> 50:02.120
They still got a vanload comin' and
what do you got besides an empty gun?

50:02.189 --> 50:06.421
- I was thankin' you, asshole.
- Kiss my ass!

50:13.467 --> 50:16.368
- 911 Emergency.
- It's goin' through.

50:16.436 --> 50:18.666
- Please hold.
- You gotta-- They put me on hold.

50:18.739 --> 50:21.833
- Probably because they know
a psycho when they hear one.
- I'm not the psycho.

50:21.909 --> 50:25.037
Take a look at your situation, and
reconsider that statement, Night Shift.

50:25.112 --> 50:27.307
You're a psycho and a hijacker.

50:27.381 --> 50:30.612
- The gun was empty.
- Every time I look at you,
I wanna hit you.

50:30.684 --> 50:33.448
- You wanna hit me?
- You know, I'm a peaceful man.
I believe in live and let live.

50:33.520 --> 50:35.488
Yeah, you stole the truck
to uphold your principles, right?

50:35.556 --> 50:39.515
- I did not steal the truck.
It was owed to me.
- You stole the damn truck!

50:39.593 --> 50:42.687
- Shut up, shut up, it's beeping.
- Well, then, that means
it's call waiting.

50:42.763 --> 50:45.755
- You snatch that phone from me
one more time--
- Hey! Hey!

50:45.832 --> 50:47.766
Andy's Ice Cream.

50:47.834 --> 50:52.794
Dutiful citizens, you have something
which I have waited years for.

50:52.873 --> 50:57.367
Give it to me now,
or you'll be dead within five minutes.

50:57.444 --> 51:00.845
- It's for you.
- Yeah?

51:00.914 --> 51:06.443
Contrary to what Dr. Long may
have told you, this is neither
your concern nor your fight.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.750
Relinquish the package,
and you can go.

51:08.822 --> 51:11.552
- I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
- What'd he say?

51:11.625 --> 51:16.824
Don't be tedious.
Dr. Long called it Elvis.

51:16.897 --> 51:19.866
You have no idea what you're
in possession of, do you?

51:22.236 --> 51:27.196
Listen, shithead! I got $3,000 of
highly perishable ice cream product...

51:27.274 --> 51:29.572
that tastes bad enough when it's frozen,
so if you don't mind--

51:29.643 --> 51:33.010
Just give me Elvis, and I'll
make sure you have enough money
for a dozen ice cream trucks.

51:33.080 --> 51:36.743
- I don't ever wanna see
another ice cream truck!
- Give me the goddamn phone.

51:36.817 --> 51:39.911
- Talk to me.
- I want you to look at one another...

51:39.987 --> 51:43.013
and ask a simple question:
Are you actually prepared...

51:43.090 --> 51:46.184
to die for a country that's
never done a thing for you?

51:46.260 --> 51:49.457
'Cause if you don't give me that
cylinder, your lives will end...

51:49.529 --> 51:51.463
on this miserable road to nowhere.

51:51.531 --> 51:55.365
And I can't guarantee
the end will be quick.

51:55.435 --> 51:59.132
Elvis is fucking dead, man.
Get yourself some CD's.

52:07.314 --> 52:09.942
Vaughn, get the M-79 ready.

52:10.017 --> 52:14.317
You can't fire on them.
You're gonna detonate the crystals.

52:14.388 --> 52:17.619
Prep the launcher now.
Now!

52:53.260 --> 52:55.956
Oh, shit.

52:59.066 --> 53:01.193
Your move.

53:01.268 --> 53:03.702
Okay, Vaughn, you drive.

53:14.481 --> 53:17.507
Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop!
Stop this boat!

53:17.584 --> 53:20.178
Whoa! Slow down!
God!

53:21.588 --> 53:23.647
Whoa!

53:23.724 --> 53:25.715
- Holy shit, man.
- Oh, shit.

53:25.792 --> 53:28.727
Back up, back up.

53:28.795 --> 53:32.026
Come on, old Pete. Come on.

53:32.099 --> 53:34.533
There it is, old Pete.
Come on, baby.

53:36.303 --> 53:38.737
You got it, you got it.
Go, go, go!

53:38.805 --> 53:40.739
Got it, got it, got it.

53:49.916 --> 53:53.852
Fuck!

53:55.655 --> 53:58.852
Oh. Oh, shit.

53:58.925 --> 54:01.723
Oh, we're screwed, Night Shift.

54:01.795 --> 54:06.823
You can just bend over and kiss
your crazy ass good-bye, buddy.

54:06.900 --> 54:11.769
- I think we can make it.
- You think we can make what?
You see that truck?

54:11.838 --> 54:14.898
Eight-and-a-half feet wide.
Weighs over five tons.

54:14.975 --> 54:20.311
And what if we don't make it?
Your weed killer on steroids goes
down with us, everybody dies.

54:20.380 --> 54:22.746
I don't think we have
much of a choice, do we?

54:24.151 --> 54:26.278
- Oh, shit.
- That's right, now move.

54:27.954 --> 54:29.888
Oh, shit.

54:31.291 --> 54:33.885
Okay, okay, okay.

54:37.230 --> 54:39.255
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

54:39.332 --> 54:43.393
- Oh, goddamn.
- Oh, Petey. Oh, Petey.

54:43.470 --> 54:47.406
Oh, please, Pete.
Please, don't do this to me.

54:50.744 --> 54:53.542
Okay. Okay!

54:56.817 --> 54:59.684
I should've had that dog bite me.
I would've got rabies.

54:59.753 --> 55:01.618
Could've went to the hospital,
had a pretty nurse.

55:01.688 --> 55:04.179
Hey, hey! Whoo! Okay!

55:04.257 --> 55:08.626
Go, go, go, go, go.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

55:11.398 --> 55:16.461
Come on, old Pete.
Come on. Come on, old Pete.

55:16.536 --> 55:18.436
Oh, man!

55:18.505 --> 55:21.133
I'm goin', I'm goin', baby.
I'm goin', I'm goin'.

55:21.208 --> 55:22.903
Easy, easy, easy.

55:24.044 --> 55:25.602
Left, left, left.
Get over, get over.

55:28.648 --> 55:30.980
Come on.

55:31.051 --> 55:33.918
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete!

55:33.987 --> 55:36.148
Come on!

55:37.591 --> 55:40.355
Come on, old Pete.
Oh.

55:40.427 --> 55:45.421
I know the likelihood
of you knowin' any prayers
is slim, but give it a try.

55:49.069 --> 55:51.299
Come on. Come on, old Pete.
Come on.

55:54.841 --> 55:57.503
Come on, you crazy bastard.

55:59.613 --> 56:02.707
All right, you got it, you got it.

56:02.782 --> 56:07.151
You got it, got it, got it.
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

56:10.023 --> 56:12.821
- Whoo!
- I made it! Whoo!

56:12.893 --> 56:15.953
- I made it! Oh, man.
- What are you talkin' about?
I'm the one drivin'.

56:23.970 --> 56:25.995
You okay?

56:26.072 --> 56:28.233
What the fuck was that?

56:46.660 --> 56:50.494
- Shit. You gotta pass him.
- Gee, you think so?

56:55.368 --> 56:57.563
Okay. That didn't work.

56:57.637 --> 56:59.605
- Gee, you think so?
- Shut up!

56:59.673 --> 57:03.609
Here we go. Oh, oh, whoa, whoa.

57:09.516 --> 57:12.076
Ho!

57:27.434 --> 57:30.801
Go on.
Go on. Go, go.

57:37.877 --> 57:41.540
Old Pete. Oh, shit.

57:41.615 --> 57:44.083
Oh, shit.

57:50.056 --> 57:52.581
Oh, shit! Oh, shoot!

57:52.659 --> 57:55.992
Oh, shoot! Okay, okay.

57:56.062 --> 57:57.996
- Come on.
- Okay. All right.

57:58.064 --> 58:00.032
- Okay, all right.
- Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.

58:00.100 --> 58:01.965
- Okay, okay.
- These'll keep it cold.

58:02.035 --> 58:05.766
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, shit. All right.

58:05.839 --> 58:10.833
- Okay.
- Okay, all right. Okay. Let's go.

58:10.910 --> 58:14.004
- Hey, put it back. Shake it off.
- Shit!

58:19.886 --> 58:23.913
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
I got an idea.

58:23.990 --> 58:27.619
- Hey, what's goin' on here?
Are you guys all right?
- Stay back!

58:27.694 --> 58:29.821
Stay back!
I'm taking your boat.

58:29.896 --> 58:32.660
- Listen to him! You don't
know who you're dealing with!
- I'm a dangerous man.

58:32.732 --> 58:35.428
He's a dangerous man!
He's crazy!

58:35.502 --> 58:37.800
I'm crazy?

58:37.871 --> 58:40.840
I'm crazy!

58:40.907 --> 58:44.468
- What are you doin'?
- Takin' her downhill.

58:44.544 --> 58:49.208
You're what?
You're not dangerous. You're crazy.
I ain't gettin' into this thing.

58:49.282 --> 58:52.376
- Then stay here.
- Oh, shit. Okay. Come on.

59:11.004 --> 59:15.202
Oh, hell, no!

59:15.275 --> 59:18.904
- I didn't want you to come anyway.
- What?

59:18.978 --> 59:24.075
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

59:49.075 --> 59:51.771
Oh!

59:58.852 --> 01:00:03.016
Don't let go! Don't let go!
Don't let--

01:00:03.089 --> 01:00:05.023
Be still.

01:00:07.527 --> 01:00:11.395
Okay. Okay.

01:00:11.464 --> 01:00:14.865
No!

01:00:14.934 --> 01:00:17.903
Oh, shit! No!

01:00:19.539 --> 01:00:22.030
Oh, no! Backwards!

01:00:37.257 --> 01:00:41.125
Whoo! Whoo!

01:00:42.195 --> 01:00:44.595
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:00:44.664 --> 01:00:46.632
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.674
- Fuck.
- All right. Hey.

01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:07.080
Are you crazy?
Take the boat?

01:01:10.256 --> 01:01:13.089
There's nothing in here, sir.
They got away with it.

01:01:13.159 --> 01:01:16.151
All right, let's clear the mess
and move out.

01:01:29.008 --> 01:01:32.205
- Uh-oh. Thing just went up a degree.
- What?

01:01:32.278 --> 01:01:36.681
- Ice cream's not workin'.
- This river's fed by a glacier.

01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:39.809
I'm willin' to bet my life it's
a good deal under 50 degrees.
What do you think?

01:01:39.886 --> 01:01:41.547
Worth a try.

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:54.758
- You didn't lock the truck
when you got out, did ya?
- You're fucked, man.

01:01:54.834 --> 01:01:58.429
- Now why would you do that
to a man in my position?
- I didn't steal the truck.

01:01:58.504 --> 01:02:00.802
- You stole the truck.
- I told you, I did not steal that truck.

01:02:00.874 --> 01:02:04.241
Andy owed me a lot more than that
four-wheeled piece of shit was worth.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.710
- It won't even start half the time.
- You know what I'm sayin'?

01:02:06.779 --> 01:02:08.872
I deserve a lot more
than that truck.

01:02:08.948 --> 01:02:12.179
Ten years-- Ten years I busted my ass
for that fat rat bastard.

01:02:12.252 --> 01:02:17.485
Hes wore once I got a degree,
there'd be a sales rep desk
with my name on it.

01:02:17.557 --> 01:02:21.288
But every time something opened up,
there'd be some idiot cousin...

01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:24.125
or nephew
or some good old boy...

01:02:24.197 --> 01:02:26.427
just ready to just slide him
right in there.

01:02:26.499 --> 01:02:29.093
What about me? What about Arlo, huh?
What about my needs?

01:02:29.168 --> 01:02:33.264
You know, I got student loans,
overdrawn bank account.

01:02:33.339 --> 01:02:37.571
Nobody lookin' out for my interest.
My credit was fucked!

01:02:37.644 --> 01:02:41.410
And then when he promoted
Sam over me, I just snapped, so I split.

01:02:48.521 --> 01:02:52.321
- So you took his truck?
- So I took his truck, yeah.

01:02:52.392 --> 01:02:56.294
This river ends
at a hydro dam in Missoula.

01:02:56.362 --> 01:02:59.126
All we need to do is get to Mason
before anyone else does.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.461
Carl, Dennis,
get out of sight.

01:03:15.381 --> 01:03:19.477
- Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
- Tell me what's going on.

01:03:19.552 --> 01:03:22.680
I'm Colonel Brynner,
U.S. Special Operations
Commander out of Fort Bragg.

01:03:22.755 --> 01:03:27.192
We were calledin by the Jerome
base to pursue a man who's
stolen government property.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.626
- Right. Tim Mason.
- You know the suspect?

01:03:29.696 --> 01:03:33.962
Yeah, he's wanted in connection
with a death this morning
at the Jerome General Store.

01:03:34.033 --> 01:03:35.967
- Richard Long.
- That's right.

01:03:36.035 --> 01:03:40.836
Long went missing from the tech center
along with a dangerous chemical weapon.

01:03:40.907 --> 01:03:42.841
I'd deeply appreciate
your assistance on this.

01:03:42.909 --> 01:03:46.470
Who knows? It might even put
some more gold on that collar of yours.

01:03:46.546 --> 01:03:49.982
Four years ago, I was a split end
at Kentucky State.

01:03:51.617 --> 01:03:54.814
- We were nationally ranked.
- How wonderful for you.

01:03:54.887 --> 01:03:57.287
Started every game
my senior year.

01:03:57.357 --> 01:03:59.723
Not all-American or anything,
but not bad.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:02.283
Anyway, the real star
was my best friend.

01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:04.296
Quarterback.
Got taken in the first round.

01:04:04.364 --> 01:04:06.992
- Robert Del Real?
- Yeah, Robert Del Real.

01:04:07.066 --> 01:04:11.025
I remember him.
Got in a car crash or something.

01:04:11.104 --> 01:04:16.542
We were celebratin' after the draft,
goin' from bar to bar.

01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:19.373
I was drivin',

01:04:19.445 --> 01:04:21.879
and I put the car into a ditch.

01:04:24.183 --> 01:04:27.516
He spent 18 weeks in the hospital.

01:04:27.587 --> 01:04:29.817
He's never gonna throw
a ball in the pros.

01:04:33.292 --> 01:04:37.558
Couldn't deal with it, so I split.

01:04:38.998 --> 01:04:42.092
And things sort of just
went downhill from there.

01:04:42.168 --> 01:04:47.333
Anyway, about ten months ago,
I wound up in Jerome
workin' for Darlene.

01:04:48.941 --> 01:04:52.377
Well, shit. Could be worse.

01:04:54.013 --> 01:04:57.107
I mean, we're both up shit's creek,
but at least we have a paddle.

01:04:57.183 --> 01:04:59.549
We got two paddles.

01:05:05.158 --> 01:05:07.718
- Is the facility secure?
- Yes, sir, Colonel.

01:05:07.794 --> 01:05:10.228
There's four dead,
but the security video's clean.

01:05:10.296 --> 01:05:13.231
It's a patched-in feed.
It's probably a loop.

01:05:18.004 --> 01:05:21.462
Deputy! Deputy, I'm Colonel Vitelli.
I'm on special assignment.

01:05:21.541 --> 01:05:24.635
Deputy Art Lewis--
Jerome County Sheriff's Department.

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:27.611
- I don't suppose you'd like
to tell me what this is all about.
- I will tell you what I can.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.774
Colonel Vitelli, we got
a busted encode vault inside.

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:33.910
- Is it--
- Looks like it. Yes, sir.

01:05:33.986 --> 01:05:37.285
Alert 75th Rangers. Code Blue.
Tell them Elvis has left the building.

01:05:37.356 --> 01:05:39.756
- What the hell are you
talkin' about, Colonel?
- Did they I.D. the bodies?

01:05:39.826 --> 01:05:41.350
- They were all wearing hardware.
- Any of them Richard Long?

01:05:41.427 --> 01:05:42.416
No, sir.

01:05:42.495 --> 01:05:45.328
I've got Dr. Long's body
down at the coroner's office.

01:05:45.398 --> 01:05:48.231
One of our units
is pursuing a suspect up the 35.

01:05:48.301 --> 01:05:50.326
- Who's your suspect?
- A man named Tim Mason.

01:05:50.403 --> 01:05:53.770
- Run a check. F.B.I., Interpol.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.674
If you're right, this Mason's one hell
of a pro. Must have a record somewhere.

01:05:57.743 --> 01:06:01.474
Mason? No. He's a soda-jerk drifter.
A hamburger flipper.

01:06:02.949 --> 01:06:05.076
It could be a cover, I suppose.

01:06:05.151 --> 01:06:08.177
Who ever did this is a man
who knows his business.

01:06:08.254 --> 01:06:13.419
Listen, Arlo. For whatever it's worth,
I'm sorry I dragged you into this shit.

01:06:13.493 --> 01:06:16.519
To tell you the truth,
you didn't.

01:06:16.596 --> 01:06:18.530
Not completely, anyway.

01:06:18.598 --> 01:06:22.534
Even if that gun was loaded,
I didn't buy you as a shooter.

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:27.237
It was your friend, Long.

01:06:27.306 --> 01:06:30.537
Something about that look in his eye
when he talked about that Elvis shit.

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:36.242
All the same, if we get to Missoula,
help me find a car.

01:06:36.315 --> 01:06:38.510
I'd appreciate it.
Then you can split.

01:06:38.584 --> 01:06:43.146
Split?
I wouldn't get ten miles.

01:06:43.222 --> 01:06:46.282
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea
of what's at stake here.

01:06:46.359 --> 01:06:49.192
We need to finish this,
Night Shift.

01:06:49.262 --> 01:06:52.720
Hang onto your ass, Missoula.
Arlo's back!

01:06:52.798 --> 01:06:57.258
And he's bringing the King!

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:19.658
Damn!

01:08:04.103 --> 01:08:06.071
Hey, Arlo!

01:08:10.343 --> 01:08:12.277
Well, that just about figures for today.

01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:16.281
So, where's my truck?

01:08:17.617 --> 01:08:20.881
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway 35.

01:08:20.953 --> 01:08:25.447
I did what I could for you, Arlo,
and you screwed me for it.

01:08:25.524 --> 01:08:27.787
Now where's my goddamn truck?

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:30.522
I ain't got time to argue
with you today, Andy.

01:08:30.595 --> 01:08:34.657
But I could tell you this--
Takin' your truck pissed you off.

01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:39.671
Huh? You're gonna be realmad
when I take the pickup.

01:08:39.738 --> 01:08:44.676
And so, Missoula's prodigal son returns.

01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:53.848
- Hello?
- I got someone who's anxious
to talk to you, Mr. Mason.

01:08:55.154 --> 01:08:57.087
I urge you to be persuasive.

01:08:57.156 --> 01:09:02.560
This country trained me to kill...
without compunction.

01:09:06.165 --> 01:09:09.760
Well, well, well, funny situation,
ain't it, Andy?

01:09:09.835 --> 01:09:12.029
Three seconds. One--

01:09:12.104 --> 01:09:14.197
- You gotta help me, Arlo.
- Two--

01:09:14.273 --> 01:09:18.505
- Why don't you get that tub
of shit Sam to help you?
- I'm sorry. I'll make it up.

01:09:18.577 --> 01:09:22.877
- Gentlemen, I have never
been known for my patience.
- Arlo!

01:09:22.948 --> 01:09:25.883
- Arlo!
- All right. Hey, hey.

01:09:27.853 --> 01:09:30.377
Hey. Mason.

01:09:30.456 --> 01:09:34.551
- Yeah?
- Looks like you gotta cut
a deal with this asshole.

01:09:34.627 --> 01:09:38.358
Even though it is nice to see
Andy squirm, I don't want
his brains all over my shirt...

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:40.331
or my conscience.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:43.630
- And you owe me, man.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

01:09:46.572 --> 01:09:49.837
- You still there, Mr. Mason?
- Yeah, I'm listenin'.

01:09:49.908 --> 01:09:52.036
Come meet me at the dam
in 15 minutes.

01:09:52.111 --> 01:09:54.875
Be intelligent about this.
Tricks'll cost lives.

01:10:03.823 --> 01:10:07.156
Create a piece
of bait that sends the fish's
instinct into overdrive,

01:10:07.226 --> 01:10:08.887
forcing him to strike.

01:10:08.961 --> 01:10:12.897
- Everything all right, son?
- Yeah, just...

01:10:12.965 --> 01:10:17.197
tryin' to remember something
somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.

01:10:17.269 --> 01:10:21.399
And only then
does our noble friend realize
that the prey can fight back.

01:10:21.474 --> 01:10:23.408
Let me have those.

01:10:28.848 --> 01:10:33.683
Sir, I think you should
take a look at this.

01:10:33.753 --> 01:10:38.588
Judging by the signature pulse
and velocity, helicopters.
Maybe 15 minutes.

01:10:38.657 --> 01:10:41.990
Rangers. That was only
a matter of time.

01:10:42.061 --> 01:10:44.495
Of which we have more than enough.

01:10:55.174 --> 01:10:57.642
All right, listen up! Stay sharp!

01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:00.975
Now this is the guy we're looking for.
His name is Tim Mason.

01:11:01.046 --> 01:11:04.447
- He's got the acrylic container.
- Do we know what's inside?

01:11:04.517 --> 01:11:07.111
You don't need to know.
Let's just get it back, all right?

01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:56.800
- I don't see my container.
- Try anything, it goes in the river.

01:11:56.869 --> 01:12:00.498
It's a little late for matinee heroics,
Mason. Just give me the container.

01:12:00.573 --> 01:12:03.167
Where's Arlo?

01:12:06.045 --> 01:12:07.808
Bring him here.

01:12:09.949 --> 01:12:11.883
I love the leather pants.

01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:33.498
Bring him down!

01:12:49.889 --> 01:12:53.689
Your fellow hero,
untouched and unharmed,

01:12:53.759 --> 01:12:56.751
despite the mouth.

01:12:56.829 --> 01:12:59.161
Him first.

01:13:05.671 --> 01:13:07.605
Run!

01:13:14.013 --> 01:13:15.742
Down!

01:13:31.163 --> 01:13:34.394
- Rangers.
- Let's go.

01:13:40.205 --> 01:13:43.299
- You should've taken the money.
- Bullshit! You would've
killed us anyway.

01:13:46.278 --> 01:13:49.441
Shit.

01:13:50.883 --> 01:13:53.374
Just when we have all the cards,
Vaughn.

01:13:53.452 --> 01:13:55.920
- Get these two behind the van.
- Move!

01:13:55.988 --> 01:13:58.616
Move!

01:14:01.627 --> 01:14:05.893
- I got the container. Bring it in.
- That's not Mason.

01:14:05.965 --> 01:14:08.490
Doesn't matter who he is.
We're goin' in.

01:14:25.484 --> 01:14:26.974
Go! Go!

01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:38.189
Move it!

01:14:42.501 --> 01:14:44.992
Come on, come on!

01:14:52.277 --> 01:14:55.144
Are you all right?

01:14:56.682 --> 01:15:00.880
That's far enough, gentlemen.
You know who I am?

01:15:00.953 --> 01:15:04.013
- Gas masks.
- Gas masks? Gas masks?

01:15:04.089 --> 01:15:06.182
The men on Horn Island
had gas masks.

01:15:06.258 --> 01:15:11.195
- Where the fuck is Horn Island?
- Was. Horn Island was.

01:15:17.069 --> 01:15:19.037
Listen, Arlo.

01:15:19.104 --> 01:15:21.163
- Hey!
- Shut your mouth!

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:34.344
Do you know what'll happen
if I drop this?

01:15:39.792 --> 01:15:44.388
- Brynner.
- Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.

01:15:44.463 --> 01:15:48.422
Good to see you again, Leo.
A pleasant surprise.

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.832
I can't say it's a surprise,

01:15:50.903 --> 01:15:53.736
and I certainly can't say it's pleasant.

01:15:53.806 --> 01:15:57.606
As soon as I heard Elvis was
on the loose, you came to mind.

01:15:57.676 --> 01:16:01.203
I checked your release date.
I never like coincidences.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:05.341
And I don't like deviations from plans,
Leo, as I'm sure you'll remember.

01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:08.079
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?

01:16:10.089 --> 01:16:12.353
He was Major Andrew Brynner.

01:16:12.424 --> 01:16:15.552
We did two tours together
in Vietnam...

01:16:15.627 --> 01:16:19.028
until he got busted down
to nursemaiding scientists.

01:16:19.098 --> 01:16:24.593
Yeah, I had a small problem with members
of our side murdering civilians,

01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:26.604
but I assure you, Leo,

01:16:26.672 --> 01:16:30.199
I lost all my squeamish ness
at Leavenworth.

01:16:30.275 --> 01:16:33.369
I'll have no compunction at all
about using this.

01:16:35.748 --> 01:16:39.275
Hmm? Wind's northwest.
That oughta be Seattle.

01:16:39.351 --> 01:16:43.549
Or I may be wrong. Breeze could be
gusting south. That'd be Billings.

01:16:43.622 --> 01:16:46.250
Maybe even Salt Lake,
not to mention Casper,

01:16:46.325 --> 01:16:51.092
- Destry, Fair Oaks.
- Knowing you, you've got
buyers waiting to buy.

01:16:51.163 --> 01:16:53.324
You're not gonna use that here.

01:16:53.398 --> 01:16:56.595
I'm warning you, Leo, don't test me.

01:16:56.668 --> 01:17:01.503
Get your men and your machines
off my radar screen in five,
or three million people will die.

01:17:01.573 --> 01:17:03.507
I'll do it.

01:17:06.111 --> 01:17:09.945
- Tell the choppers we're liftin' off.
- Excuse me, sir?

01:17:10.015 --> 01:17:12.779
Your colonel's giving you
a wise order, soldier.

01:17:12.851 --> 01:17:15.319
It's not over, Brynner.

01:17:20.025 --> 01:17:22.391
- Sir, we just can't let him
get away with this!
- Gomez--

01:17:22.461 --> 01:17:25.055
You fight the battles you can win.
We've been out maneuvered here.

01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:28.065
Brynner's next move is gonna be
to get Elvis out of the country
and sell to the highest bidder.

01:17:28.133 --> 01:17:30.226
To do that, he has to have planned
an exit point.

01:17:30.302 --> 01:17:34.329
That's where we intercept him.
That's when we make our play.
You and your men back off.

01:17:36.708 --> 01:17:38.642
All right, let's move out!

01:17:43.949 --> 01:17:46.440
- They're taking off. They're leaving.
- Huh?

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.793
Dennis, get your links set up.
I wanna patch in from here.

01:18:00.866 --> 01:18:05.303
- What about these two?
- We're gonna use 'em
for demonstration footage.

01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:09.500
Having witnessed the effects,
I can assure you it'll be very
useful when the bidding starts.

01:18:09.575 --> 01:18:13.067
- Get 'em in the middle of the dam.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:13.145 --> 01:18:15.136
- Up!
- Taipei is on-line.

01:18:15.214 --> 01:18:18.206
Geneva's comin' up,
and we should have Karachi and Kabul
in a couple of minutes.

01:18:18.283 --> 01:18:22.049
All right. Tell the pilot
we'll be a half hour.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.816
Carl, set up the camera!

01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:29.987
Dennis, we will open
the bidding at $100 million.

01:19:02.094 --> 01:19:04.085
It won't be long, gentlemen.

01:19:08.467 --> 01:19:10.867
And it won't be pleasant.

01:19:13.305 --> 01:19:18.208
But such is the price of patriotism.

01:19:18.277 --> 01:19:20.939
Vaughn.

01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:24.113
Hey!

01:19:26.485 --> 01:19:28.453
- Hey!
- Shut up.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.249
- We gonna die.
- Shut up.

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:36.989
- Everybody's linked up.
- All right. Clear the area.

01:19:44.369 --> 01:19:47.236
- We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:19:47.306 --> 01:19:51.766
Put your hand in my pants.

01:19:51.843 --> 01:19:57.008
- What? We gonna die, you want
me to do some freakish shit!
- Arlo! Arlo.

01:19:57.082 --> 01:19:59.915
Reach into my pocket.

01:20:03.655 --> 01:20:05.919
Okay, okay.

01:20:05.991 --> 01:20:09.119
- Come on!
- Oh, okay. Okay.

01:20:09.194 --> 01:20:11.526
Okay. All right.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.534
- Okay, okay.
- Give me your shoes.

01:20:17.602 --> 01:20:21.094
Okay. Okay.

01:20:21.173 --> 01:20:24.540
Arlo!

01:20:24.609 --> 01:20:27.601
I'm sorry. I'm just a little stressed,
little stressed.

01:20:27.679 --> 01:20:32.207
- I'm on it.
- Stay put. Keep the camera on them.

01:20:32.284 --> 01:20:37.312
Boundor loose, their deaths will be
equally effective and inevitable.

01:20:37.389 --> 01:20:41.052
Sir, I got Taipei grinding on me here.
How long is this supposed to ta--

01:20:41.126 --> 01:20:44.527
- I borrowed a truck.
- Oh, you borrowed,
but I stole the truck.

01:20:44.596 --> 01:20:47.724
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Kabul is out.

01:20:47.799 --> 01:20:49.733
Okay. Come on, come on.

01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:51.792
Pakistan says
they'll be back tomorrow.

01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:55.897
- And Taipei just went off-line, sir.
- Go.

01:20:59.945 --> 01:21:03.642
- Okay, here we go.
- Go, go, go!

01:21:05.984 --> 01:21:08.612
- You just can't leave
that stuff with that lunatic.
- I didn't give it to him.

01:21:08.687 --> 01:21:14.091
- What? You got Elvis?
- Sometimes the prey bites back. Go!

01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:25.535
Hang on!

01:21:32.811 --> 01:21:35.177
Whoo!

01:21:40.185 --> 01:21:45.020
- Aw, shit. Would you be more careful?
- Okay. Okay.

01:21:47.759 --> 01:21:50.125
- Positions! We're taking up the hunt.
- Come on, Brynner, it's over.

01:21:50.195 --> 01:21:52.129
Nobody said anything
about goin' up against Rangers.

01:21:52.197 --> 01:21:54.131
Besides, how we gonna sell
something we don't have?

01:21:54.199 --> 01:21:56.690
Nothing has changed,
I assure you both.

01:21:56.768 --> 01:21:59.794
The Army still thinks we got Elvis.
They made a tactical withdrawal.

01:21:59.871 --> 01:22:01.805
It's just those two amateurs now.

01:22:01.873 --> 01:22:04.774
You really wanna concede
$100 million to them?

01:22:33.238 --> 01:22:38.403
Carl, establish contact
with that deputy we met earlier.
He'll be most useful now.

01:22:47.319 --> 01:22:49.913
We need more ice.

01:22:49.988 --> 01:22:53.924
There's a service station
on the other end of the North Ridge
Tunnel. They'll have ice.

01:22:57.896 --> 01:23:00.694
Fuck-- 45.7.

01:23:00.765 --> 01:23:03.632
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:23:10.609 --> 01:23:12.804
- Come here!
- What's going on, Colonel?

01:23:12.878 --> 01:23:15.312
All right, this is
what I want you to do.

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:18.747
The Ranger units in McGruder have got
the local airports covered, sir.

01:23:18.817 --> 01:23:21.411
- Pentagon's covering
the international traffic.
- Good.

01:23:21.486 --> 01:23:24.387
Gomez, I want two birds
back to Missoula.

01:23:24.456 --> 01:23:28.688
- I wanna rendezvous here,
approach from the southwest.
- Yes, sir. Let's do it!

01:23:31.129 --> 01:23:35.429
Colonel, you've got a Tim Mason
patched through from McGruder.

01:23:37.302 --> 01:23:40.567
- This is Vitelli. Is that you, Mason?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Colonel!

01:23:40.639 --> 01:23:43.972
- Listen, I've got Elvis!
I got the real thing.
- We! We got Elvis!

01:23:44.042 --> 01:23:46.010
What? Say again, Mason.

01:23:46.077 --> 01:23:49.478
What we gave Brynner
on the dam was a phony.

01:23:49.548 --> 01:23:52.381
- We've got the real thing!
- Where are you now?

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.351
I'm at mile marker 62...

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.911
heading west on 35.

01:23:57.989 --> 01:24:01.481
- Here they come!
- Brynner's right on our ass!

01:24:10.769 --> 01:24:12.202
He's comin' up fast!

01:24:22.914 --> 01:24:24.541
Hit him.

01:24:27.686 --> 01:24:30.052
Shit!

01:24:33.024 --> 01:24:34.685
Hit him again.

01:24:41.933 --> 01:24:45.130
We gotta take out Brynner's van
before they reach that tunnel.

01:24:45.203 --> 01:24:46.864
Get ready to take it out.

01:24:48.106 --> 01:24:49.869
- Okay, here comes the tunnel.
- Tunnel.

01:24:58.783 --> 01:25:00.876
- Do it now!
- Hit it now!

01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:26.568
Good. Head for the other end
of the tunnel. I'll stay here
and secure this position.

01:25:30.181 --> 01:25:32.911
- Forty-seven-- you'd better floor it.
- What do you think I'm doin'?

01:25:32.984 --> 01:25:35.077
It's a damn postal truck.

01:25:35.153 --> 01:25:37.917
- What the hell?
- What the--

01:25:39.424 --> 01:25:41.915
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

01:25:46.865 --> 01:25:49.857
- Let me see your hands.
- Oh!

01:25:49.934 --> 01:25:52.300
Pappas, move the car!

01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:55.965
- Move the car, please!
- Unbe-fucking-lievable.

01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:58.271
I said, let me see your hands now!

01:25:58.343 --> 01:26:01.835
You redneck idiot, do you have any idea
what's goin' on here?

01:26:01.913 --> 01:26:05.007
Yeah, asshole. I'm puttin'
a murder suspect...

01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:07.745
and a guy that stole a truck
under arrest-- now raise 'em.

01:26:07.819 --> 01:26:11.152
Let me put it in easy terms,
Aristotle.

01:26:11.222 --> 01:26:13.520
We are carrying a damn bomb...

01:26:13.591 --> 01:26:17.220
that is going to explode if we don't
get out of this tunnel!

01:26:18.463 --> 01:26:20.693
No sign of 'em, Colonel.

01:26:29.274 --> 01:26:31.208
Yeah?

01:26:31.276 --> 01:26:34.040
- Mason, what is
the temperature of Elvis?
- Forty-seven.

01:26:34.112 --> 01:26:37.047
If you're not out of there soon,
I have got to seal the tunnel.

01:26:38.283 --> 01:26:40.217
God!
They're gonna seal it.

01:26:40.285 --> 01:26:43.550
- Why don't they talk
to the sage of Jerome here?
- What the hell's a sage?

01:26:43.621 --> 01:26:47.751
Listen, Pappas, there's a colonel
on the other end of this phone.

01:26:47.826 --> 01:26:51.592
His name's Vitelli.
Talk to him. He's right outside.

01:26:51.663 --> 01:26:53.893
What happened
to Colonel Brynner?

01:26:53.965 --> 01:26:57.765
Listen, Deputy. He's the dude
the Army guys are lookin' for.

01:26:57.836 --> 01:27:00.066
Bullshit.
Put the phone down, Mason.

01:27:00.138 --> 01:27:03.335
- I've had enough of both of you.
- Wait. Listen to me, Pappas.

01:27:03.408 --> 01:27:08.710
If you don't let us by,
we're all gonna die in this tunnel now!

01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:11.374
- Go check the temperature.
- Don't move.

01:27:13.651 --> 01:27:15.585
Shoot me.

01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:20.089
What's it say?

01:27:21.593 --> 01:27:23.527
Forty-nine point four.

01:27:23.595 --> 01:27:27.122
- It says 49.
- Forty-nine?

01:27:27.198 --> 01:27:32.602
Colonel, we gotta seal
that tunnel. Colonel!

01:27:32.670 --> 01:27:35.571
- Night Shift. It's melting, man.
- What?

01:27:37.609 --> 01:27:39.634
Oh, shit. Shit.

01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:41.770
- Mason, Mason.
- Yeah?

01:27:41.846 --> 01:27:45.805
It's too late, Mason.
I've gotta seal it.

01:27:45.884 --> 01:27:51.083
Right. All right, we're gonna seal
that tunnel. I want it air tight.

01:27:56.528 --> 01:27:59.088
What the hell was that?

01:27:59.164 --> 01:28:02.065
- It's the Army sealin' us in.
- Jesus.

01:28:02.133 --> 01:28:06.092
- What the hell is goin' on?
- All I had to do was get it on ice.

01:28:06.171 --> 01:28:08.230
Now it's over!

01:28:08.306 --> 01:28:11.139
Kiss your ass good-bye, Pappas.

01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:13.677
Ice? You want ice?
I got a whole case of beer...

01:28:13.745 --> 01:28:16.612
- back here in the car
floatin 'in the stuff.
- You're kiddin' me!

01:28:16.681 --> 01:28:18.945
- Nail it up.
- Okay.

01:28:19.017 --> 01:28:22.350
- We've got ice!
- What? Say again, Mason.
I can barely hear you.

01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:26.322
- We've got it on ice.
We've got Elvis on ice.
- Hold it.

01:28:30.395 --> 01:28:32.522
Come on.

01:28:40.071 --> 01:28:43.006
- We're too late.
- Oh.

01:28:44.409 --> 01:28:49.346
- Oh, we're too late.
- Oh, shit. Oh, we're too late.

01:29:00.258 --> 01:29:02.692
- It's workin'.
- What?

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.127
- What? What?
- It's working.

01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:13.029
- We gotta get outta here.
- Vitelli! Can we get out
on your end of the tunnel?

01:29:13.104 --> 01:29:15.971
Negative! Negative! There's ammo fire
from Brynner's vehicle.

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.201
He must've had
a damned arsenal in there.

01:29:18.276 --> 01:29:20.801
Well, hell, the smoke's
gonna kill us anyway.

01:29:20.879 --> 01:29:24.144
There's gotta be
another way outta here.

01:29:28.586 --> 01:29:30.520
Hold this.

01:29:37.328 --> 01:29:39.489
Sorry.

01:29:39.564 --> 01:29:43.500
I think I found a way out. There's
a vent shaft leading straight up.

01:29:43.568 --> 01:29:45.502
Okay. I'll have a chopper
meet you at the top.

01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:47.765
- All right, I'll lead 'em out.
- You sure?

01:29:47.839 --> 01:29:49.739
Yeah, I'm sure.
Go on. Follow me.

01:29:49.807 --> 01:29:54.005
- Come on, let's go.
- That's it. Hang on, hang on.

01:29:54.078 --> 01:29:57.411
- Let's go!
- Got it?

01:29:57.482 --> 01:30:00.110
Come on, darlin'.
Come on, darlin', I got ya.

01:30:00.184 --> 01:30:02.345
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.
You go.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:06.754
- They'll meet you at the top.
- Okay. Come on, big guy.

01:30:24.509 --> 01:30:27.569
Faster. Come on, Night Shift.

01:31:01.846 --> 01:31:03.780
No.

01:31:05.817 --> 01:31:08.479
Where's Elvis?

01:31:08.553 --> 01:31:11.021
Dead, last time I checked.

01:31:20.198 --> 01:31:24.430
- Kill him now.
- Ah, don't worry.

01:31:24.502 --> 01:31:29.872
- I'm a professional.
This won't hurt a bit.
- Well, I'm an amateur.

01:31:29.941 --> 01:31:32.603
And this is gonna hurt like hell.

01:32:00.972 --> 01:32:02.906
Come on!

01:32:10.948 --> 01:32:14.577
All right, squat over there.
Grab him.

01:32:14.652 --> 01:32:18.053
- Is Elvis out?
- Negative, negative.

01:32:37.341 --> 01:32:41.573
- Why? You're a nothing. Nobody. Why?
- You'd never understand.

01:32:41.646 --> 01:32:43.876
I would've in another life.

01:32:43.948 --> 01:32:48.578
They took that life away and left me
with nothing. But now I have it all.

01:33:06.437 --> 01:33:09.531
- What'd you come back for?
- Why'd you stay behind?

01:33:16.314 --> 01:33:19.249
Elvis is still in there.
It's gonna go off.

01:33:25.156 --> 01:33:27.090
Now!
Seal that tunnel now!

01:34:08.299 --> 01:34:12.235
- Do you need some help
gettin' in the ambulance?
- No, thanks.

01:34:20.545 --> 01:34:25.175
You know, we saved half a million people
from a full body peel.

01:34:25.249 --> 01:34:27.547
We're the shit. Big-time.

01:34:27.618 --> 01:34:29.882
They aren't exactly gonna
publicize this, Arlo.

01:34:29.954 --> 01:34:33.390
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
we're heroes, my man.

01:34:33.457 --> 01:34:35.618
It's time to start actin' like it.
Quit limpin' around like that.

01:34:35.693 --> 01:34:38.685
- Excuse me, I got a bullet in my leg.
- Always the negative with you.

01:34:38.763 --> 01:34:41.823
All right, gentlemen,
we're about done here.

01:34:41.899 --> 01:34:44.367
- Fine job.
- Thank you.

01:34:44.435 --> 01:34:47.563
Your country and a lot of innocent
people in it owe you.

01:34:47.638 --> 01:34:51.404
- Us. Owe us.
- You did help a little.

01:34:51.475 --> 01:34:54.035
Who drove the ice cream truck
that kept Elvis cool?

01:34:54.111 --> 01:34:56.341
Who had to put a gun
to your head?

01:34:56.414 --> 01:34:59.406
Who put the big hurt on that Army
nut job to save your narrow butt?

01:34:59.483 --> 01:35:01.883
- You, Arlo. You!
- Hello? Right.

01:35:01.953 --> 01:35:05.684
You damn skippy. And now
that I am both jobless...

01:35:05.756 --> 01:35:08.691
and-- and truckless
in the service of my country,

01:35:08.759 --> 01:35:12.627
- I feel that my government
owes me a little restitution.
- Us. Owes us.

01:35:12.697 --> 01:35:16.189
I'll handle it from here, sweet dear.
Owes us a little restitution.

01:35:17.802 --> 01:35:20.362
We do have to take into consideration,
that through your courage...

01:35:20.438 --> 01:35:24.204
- and selfless actions,
you did save millions of lives.
- Exactly.

01:35:24.275 --> 01:35:28.575
However, you are also non-enlisted
personnel with detailed knowledge...

01:35:28.646 --> 01:35:31.672
of classified secrets falling
under the National Security Act.

01:35:31.749 --> 01:35:36.345
In order to protect those secrets, I am
authorized to fine you, imprison you,

01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:39.446
to take any extreme measures
I deem necessary,

01:35:39.523 --> 01:35:42.390
including the permanently extreme.

01:35:48.966 --> 01:35:51.366
- I'd say we're about even.
- Patriotism is its own reward.

01:35:51.435 --> 01:35:52.800
I think so too.

01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:56.101
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

01:35:58.576 --> 01:36:01.909
- What about all that "no need to
get in the man's face" crap?
- I was not in the man's face.

01:36:01.979 --> 01:36:04.812
- I was negotiating.
- That's negotiating?
He threatened to kill us.

01:36:04.882 --> 01:36:08.249
-But he didn't. See, that's negotiation.
-No.

01:36:08.319 --> 01:36:11.550
- That's bullshit.
- Bullshit, yeah.

01:36:14.759 --> 01:36:17.227
Well, if we're not gonna be famous,

01:36:17.295 --> 01:36:20.423
at least this'll be a great story
to tell some ladies in a bar somewhere.

01:36:20.498 --> 01:36:22.432
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:26.834
Nobody's even gonna
know this happened,
except for the Army, you and me.

01:36:26.904 --> 01:36:30.772
- You shouldn't be walking on that.
- Hello, somebody.

01:36:30.841 --> 01:36:33.173
Heard you saved a lot of lives.

01:36:33.244 --> 01:36:36.111
The Army said it was a terrorist bomb.

01:36:38.983 --> 01:36:40.416
- Oh, I feel faint.
- Oh!

01:36:41.385 --> 01:36:45.344
- Oh, you got me?
You got me? Okay.
- I got ya.

01:36:45.423 --> 01:36:47.015
- You got me?
- I got ya. Hold on.

01:36:47.091 --> 01:36:52.085
- It's very hush-hush,
as we say in the spy game.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36:52.163 --> 01:36:54.961
It all started with our mission
in Istanbul, you see.

01:36:55.032 --> 01:36:58.297
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Code name was Blackjack.

01:36:58.369 --> 01:37:02.567
Night Shift was my coach.
Uh-uh-uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.040
He handled the rackets,
and I carried the balls.

01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:07.839
- You see, that was my mission.
- He was using big balls.

01:37:07.912 --> 01:37:10.244
That's right.
Ooh, that's it. Just grab--

01:37:10.314 --> 01:37:14.444
just put your arm--
Don't be afraid. You got
a nice strong grip for a woman.

01:37:14.518 --> 01:37:16.918
- Yes, you do.
- Wait here a minute.
I'm gonna bandage you.

01:37:16.988 --> 01:37:21.152
- And that's a wonderful
walkie-talkie you got there.
- Do I have to get naked?

01:37:21.225 --> 01:37:23.159
- I don't have to?
- Thank you.
