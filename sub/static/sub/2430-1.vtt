02:39.868 --> 02:41.908
Good morning. Had your breakfast?

02:42.538 --> 02:44.826
Good morning. Yes, thanks.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.536
I gathered some mushrooms.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.785
Would you like some fried?

02:50.045 --> 02:51.919
No thanks. Really. I'm full.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.411
Thanks.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.299
Fine. Have a nice day.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.747
By the way...

02:57.928 --> 02:59.552
do you keep horses at this hotel?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.299
No, no horses.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.677
You don't?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.307
I saw horses on your website.

03:06.478 --> 03:10.807
True, there are lots of wild horses
around here.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.306
I mean...

03:12.484 --> 03:14.560
it's just to decorate the website.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.518
I see.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.363
Good morning, Mr Aydin.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.611
- Where on earth were you?
- I'm here.

03:23.953 --> 03:27.618
The client wants his breakfast,
and there's nobody here.

03:27.791 --> 03:28.989
Where's Hidayet?

03:29.167 --> 03:30.745
Here somewhere.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.836
Shall I make your coffee, Mr Aydin?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.086
Shall I make your coffee?

03:38.259 --> 03:39.802
I gathered mushrooms.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.843
Oh, where did you find them?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.426
Is Nihal up yet?

03:49.604 --> 03:52.605
Mrs Nihal got up early
and had breakfast already.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.563
Is she in her room?

03:57.779 --> 04:00.151
I don't know. I suppose so.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.159
Is Necla up?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.408
Mrs Necla hasn't come down yet.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.790
I see.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.336
Bring the coffee to my study.

05:43.135 --> 05:46.219
WINTER SLEEP

06:12.538 --> 06:15.493
- Will the dogs attack us?
- No, don't worry.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.744
Ekrem!

06:35.186 --> 06:36.384
Ekrem!

06:44.863 --> 06:46.405
The horse I'll catch for you

06:46.531 --> 06:48.608
is the toughest breed in Turkey.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.533
Come on, we saw them for 600.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.991
But how old are they?

06:53.162 --> 06:55.998
Are their legs OK? Their tendons?

06:56.165 --> 06:58.289
Any lung or heart problems?

06:58.460 --> 07:00.037
You don't know anything.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.960
You'll go and buy one, then be sorry.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.631
You'll pay 500, then sell it for 300.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.507
I'll catch you a young, sturdy one.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.558
He'll be your friend for life.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.887
Isn't that perfect?

07:15.059 --> 07:16.719
- The color?
- You can choose.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.223
There's a choice.

07:18.397 --> 07:22.809
Just let me check its hooves
to make sure it's sturdy.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.107
Two years ago, I caught a horse.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.145
I entered it in the Jockey Club
endurance race.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.689
It won the 80km event.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.240
The guys said it was
as small as a donkey.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.282
"But donkeys lead camels",
I told them.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.331
That's our Anatolian horses.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.371
I finished 45 minutes
before the rest.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.538
- 45 minutes!
- 27 horses started.

07:45.132 --> 07:49.592
These are our ancestors' horses,
fine, hardy beasts.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.552
So when can we do it?

07:51.930 --> 07:55.298
When I have time
and the weather's fine.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.101
This coming week?

07:57.268 --> 07:58.348
If the mud dries.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.435
I'll let you know.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.203
Did the other one pay
after the warning?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.530
No. Nothing.

09:00.706 --> 09:04.242
The lawyer says we could evict him
in two months.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.708
How?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.712
The law protects the tenants.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.964
They don't know all that.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.972
I don't think
they will even hire a lawyer.

09:19.475 --> 09:23.011
Sometimes,
I'm tempted to sell them all,

09:23.187 --> 09:25.227
although they come from my father.

09:25.565 --> 09:30.310
They think you're a bit soft.
That's why they behave like this.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.361
Otherwise, there's no such thing
around here.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.616
How dare they not pay rent?

09:37.786 --> 09:42.911
Come on, Hidayet. What else can I do?

09:43.333 --> 09:45.705
What's so soft about me?

09:46.377 --> 09:49.663
We go to court.
What else can we do?

09:49.840 --> 09:50.753
Well, Mr Aydin,

09:50.924 --> 09:53.545
there are actually
lots of things to do.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.216
Anyway...

10:05.855 --> 10:07.313
Fucking bastard!

10:10.235 --> 10:11.397
Come here, you!

10:39.222 --> 10:41.013
Get up, you!

10:41.808 --> 10:43.350
Keep still or I'll slap you.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.680
- What happened?
- I caught him.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.518
I mean, why is he soaked?

10:50.734 --> 10:51.765
He fell in the water.

10:51.943 --> 10:55.110
He tried to jump the stream
and slipped.

10:55.613 --> 10:59.148
- Any bruises?
- No. He just got wet.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.153
So why throw the stone?

11:02.328 --> 11:05.448
Soaked like that,
best get him home quick

11:05.623 --> 11:08.957
before he catches cold.
I'll explain later, Mr Aydin.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.123
Alright.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.220
Come on.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.945
- I'll talk to them.
- Alright.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.721
Hamdi hodja!

12:25.537 --> 12:26.995
You get inside.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.581
Hello.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.411
Hello.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.287
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.167
Your kid fell in the water.
We brought him back quick.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.679
- Where, how?
- Near Issiz.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.976
He slipped jumping the stream
and got wet.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.854
What was he doing there?

12:54.816 --> 12:58.019
He was hiding, waiting for our car.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.768
He threw a stone
and broke our window.

13:00.947 --> 13:05.027
We'd have crashed if I hadn't
managed to turn and brake.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.119
- My son Ilyas?
- Yes.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.532
- He broke your window with a stone?
- Yes. Go see for yourself.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.168
How can such a little kid
break a window like that?

13:21.426 --> 13:24.925
You know better than me, Ismail.
He's your son after all.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.966
Stop bullshitting.

13:29.684 --> 13:30.715
Say what you want.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.008
Nothing to say.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.980
The glass is there. You tell me.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.651
It's no simple matter.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.906
We nearly crashed, Ismail.
What do you except?

13:46.868 --> 13:48.148
Am I wrong?

13:49.454 --> 13:51.411
Anyway, we'll pay for it.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.080
Look, it's not just about the money.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.751
Call the kid and ask him
what got into him.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.795
We asked him already,
but he wouldn't say.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.885
We nearly died out there,
because of a shitty little stone.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.882
It's no joke, Ismail.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.556
Ilyas.

14:17.649 --> 14:18.680
Come here!

14:33.039 --> 14:34.948
Did you throw the stone, son?

14:44.508 --> 14:45.505
Did you?

14:49.806 --> 14:50.968
Ilyas!

14:51.641 --> 14:53.550
Did you throw that stone?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.315
Go now.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.321
There was no need for that.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.409
Don't go over the top.

15:53.828 --> 15:58.739
But it's not so simple.
That's why I'm telling you.

16:07.925 --> 16:08.874
Hidayet.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.528
How's that? Happy?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.996
Is that alright now?
Feel better?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.115
A slap for a broken window.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.254
Is that enough for you two?

16:46.547 --> 16:48.873
Or should I call him back
for some more?

16:50.926 --> 16:53.797
What's all this, Ismail?
What's happening?

16:55.556 --> 16:56.505
Hidayet?

16:56.724 --> 16:59.844
The kid fell in the water.
We brought him back.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.058
But we shouldn't have bothered.

17:04.647 --> 17:07.603
Our Ilyas broke their car window.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.568
- He broke their window?
- Yes.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.605
So they're here to make us pay.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.188
Did I say that?

17:13.406 --> 17:17.191
Didn't I say we brought him home
so he wouldn't get sick?

17:17.369 --> 17:18.781
Cut it out.

17:20.039 --> 17:24.830
You took our fridge and TV
for a lousy rent. Isn't that enough?

17:25.002 --> 17:26.960
Now you're hassling a kid?

17:27.713 --> 17:30.418
- Stop showing off, Ismail.
- What did you say?

17:30.592 --> 17:33.462
- Don't bullshit me, Ismail.
- What bullshit?

17:33.636 --> 17:35.296
Ismail, don't piss me off.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.878
What the fuck?

17:37.056 --> 17:40.140
- Whatever. Get lost.
- What the fuck did you say?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.472
Stop bullshitting.

17:41.644 --> 17:45.059
You come and hassle me at home.
Who the hell do you think you are?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.511
I've no time for all this...

17:46.691 --> 17:49.811
- Clear off, Hamdi. I'll fuck him up!
- Ismail!

17:49.986 --> 17:52.025
Come here!
Come here, I'm telling you.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.023
Don't make it any worse.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.356
Ismail, I'm talking to you.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.859
Let go.
I'll fuck him over right here.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.527
Stop it!

18:02.332 --> 18:03.873
I'll kill that fucker.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.082
I'll fuck you up, son of a bitch.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.543
Come on, throw it, you fucker.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.789
- Stop cursing, son of a bitch!
- Get lost!

18:10.965 --> 18:12.756
Leave it, Ismail. Get in.

18:12.925 --> 18:13.838
Come here!

18:17.513 --> 18:18.888
Fuck off.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.640
Get him inside!

18:24.562 --> 18:26.768
- Look at that bastard.
- Come on.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.146
Letting a drunk provoke you.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.642
But he kept cursing.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.867
I'll go and see.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.078
Fuck.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.637
Hidayet, I'm really sorry.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.228
I'm as shocked as you.
I don't know what to say.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.475
What's going on, Hamdi?

19:11.650 --> 19:14.734
What's all this show about?
It's beyond me.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.318
He wouldn't dare act big
if you weren't here.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.160
Well... the window's broken

19:21.327 --> 19:23.070
and we'll pay for it.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.819
We'll pay the rent
as soon we can, too.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.411
We haven't forgotten. God willing,
I'll bring it all to you in person.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.377
But we're having a hard time.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.464
We're not here for that.
That's a different issue.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.376
We always pay our debts.

19:37.552 --> 19:42.629
Mr Aydin's late father knew us well.
With him, we never had any problems.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.179
We got on well for years.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.388
That's why you didn't have to do
what you did.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.227
Wouldn't it be better
if we weren't disgraced?

19:52.400 --> 19:55.484
Don't you agree?
We too have our pride.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.938
For God's sake, Hamdi,
drop that talk.

19:59.365 --> 20:04.193
We didn't say anything for months.
You'll start blaming us at this rate.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.279
OK, Hidayet, come on.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.871
But sending a debt collector
so suddenly, is that right?

20:10.043 --> 20:13.411
You could have talked to us first.
Talking exists, doesn't it?

20:13.587 --> 20:14.618
Come on, Hidayet.

20:14.797 --> 20:18.629
How many times did we talk?
How many times did I tell you?

20:18.801 --> 20:21.292
I did, didn't I?

20:21.470 --> 20:22.799
A thousand times, Mr Aydin.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.965
You'll talk about it later. Come on.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.845
And I told you we'd sort it out.
Didn't I?

20:28.019 --> 20:30.723
And did you sort it out?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.771
Is it sorted out, Hamdi?

20:33.775 --> 20:34.973
Forget it, it's OK.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.024
My apologies again, Mr Aydin.

20:37.194 --> 20:40.777
I myself will bring the money
for the window to your place.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.317
OK, you'll talk about it later.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.904
I'll settle it quickly.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.529
I'll come whenever it suits you.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.162
- Alright.
- Please, don't worry.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.368
You waste your time with anybody.

20:54.545 --> 20:57.499
Jerk. Scum of the earth.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.709
- My apologies again.
- Who the hell are you?

21:00.885 --> 21:02.462
OK, bye.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.758
Have a good day.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.734
Bastard. Son of a bitch.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.286
Fatma.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.120
Come here.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.545
What's that?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.758
Your dowry. What do you think?

21:43.928 --> 21:45.256
Put them down.

21:46.138 --> 21:46.920
Take these.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.426
Leave them.

21:48.682 --> 21:52.431
- Where shall I take them?
- Out back, to the terrace.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.928
Careful, don't bump into anything.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.600
Easy. Come on.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.518
- Let me take it.
- I'm fine.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.400
I'm off to get the window fixed.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.861
- Alright.
- Anything else?

22:08.286 --> 22:09.281
No.

22:09.453 --> 22:13.368
Should I get a brand-name
or generic product?

22:14.833 --> 22:16.376
Where'll you get a brand?

22:16.543 --> 22:20.162
Nowhere. That's why I'm asking.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.335
Huh?

22:25.219 --> 22:26.796
Go on, Hidayet.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.647
- Do we have guests?
- Levent the teacher is here.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.401
- So they had tea?
- Yes, but they want coffee now.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.243
Hello.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.659
- How was your walk?
- Yeah, good.

22:59.837 --> 23:02.078
- Do you need anything?
- No, thanks.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.747
- Are you hungry?
- No. Thanks.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.074
What are you doing?

23:37.541 --> 23:38.490
Not much.

23:38.668 --> 23:41.159
Here's a hot drink for my brother.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.125
That's nice of you.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.750
Who'd care for me,
if you weren't around?

23:46.925 --> 23:50.923
- We're out of lime, so I made sage.
- Don't worry, it's fine.

23:51.513 --> 23:55.428
Don't stop. I'll just flick through
some magazines.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.261
Sure.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.111
Are you writing your column?

24:11.783 --> 24:13.860
I'm trying to.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.626
By the way, I read last week's.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.209
I liked it.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.587
Which one do you mean?

24:30.761 --> 24:34.462
Urban ugliness in Anatolia.
Aesthetic deprivation and so on.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.134
- Right.
- Bravo.

24:37.143 --> 24:41.851
How do you come up with
interesting ideas every week?

24:42.773 --> 24:44.517
Did you really like it?

24:45.693 --> 24:47.152
It was good.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.561
It's not about wealth and poverty.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.814
Poverty existed in the past, too.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.858
If you only have three olives,
you can place them nicely on a plate,

24:56.036 --> 24:59.156
or gobble them
out of the plastic bag.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.282
I know what you mean.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.585
I told you we went to the hodja's?
You know, our tenant.

25:04.753 --> 25:05.667
Yes?

25:05.838 --> 25:09.171
If you saw how filthy it was,
how messy.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.594
- Did you go in?
- No, I mean the garden.

25:13.846 --> 25:14.841
They've ruined it.

25:15.806 --> 25:19.175
A woman lives there too,
but you wouldn't think so.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.015
First of all, you are a man of God.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.557
You should be a model
to your community.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.602
Shouldn't you be neat and tidy?

25:29.027 --> 25:31.020
Who is he? Do I know him?

25:31.488 --> 25:32.603
No, you wouldn't.

25:33.115 --> 25:36.151
An old tenant
from back in my father's day.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.992
I'd walk past him in the street.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.821
Just a crooked, shabby guy.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.451
I don't know...

25:44.626 --> 25:48.291
Shouldn't men of God
be a model to the public?

25:48.714 --> 25:50.588
Especially in rural areas.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.634
Perhaps I should write about that
next week?

25:54.803 --> 25:57.259
The very thought of him
gets on my nerves.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.178
Of course, write about
anything you want.

26:02.353 --> 26:03.930
But...

26:04.730 --> 26:08.644
Wouldn't it be better to write
for a bigger paper

26:08.818 --> 26:10.976
instead of a local one nobody reads?

26:11.779 --> 26:15.942
Then at least it would be worth
all your efforts.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.279
I don't feel I'm making any efforts.

26:20.871 --> 26:25.663
I mean, I hear you typing away
in front of your computer all week.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.874
That's why.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.588
If you didn't bring me that paper,

26:32.758 --> 26:36.257
I wouldn't even know it existed.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.840
That's what I mean.

26:38.013 --> 26:41.216
Frankly, I don't give a damn
about big papers.

26:42.475 --> 26:45.975
My kingdom may be small
but at least I'm the king there.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.271
I mean, who's going to read
this paper?

26:50.234 --> 26:51.893
Who's going to buy it?

26:52.111 --> 26:55.230
I don't agree with you,
my dear Necla.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.280
On the contrary.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.242
Sometimes I receive
letters from my readers

27:01.704 --> 27:04.574
that prove to me
I'm on the right path.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.664
Even my efforts, as you say,

27:07.835 --> 27:10.160
feel more than worth it.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.338
- Take yesterday...
- Yes but sometimes on the Internet,

27:13.507 --> 27:16.544
some awful writers get praised
to high heaven.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.168
Everyone has their fans somehow.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.767
That's why I think one shouldn't
take such praise so seriously.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.681
I mean, that shouldn't be
your reference.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.318
Anyway, keep on writing.
Don't let me distract you.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.236
I'll just lie down here.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.367
In silence.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.853
The mud makes driving up here hard.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.146
Why don't you lay some gravel?

28:14.276 --> 28:17.230
The tourists like it this way,
it's more natural.

28:17.946 --> 28:22.240
I didn't say asphalt, I said gravel.
That's natural too.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.326
With gravel,
half the tourists wouldn't come.

28:25.495 --> 28:29.160
Very few clients in winter, in fact.
Wouldn't be worth it.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.455
Of course nobody comes with this mud.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.331
Don't want everyone here anyway.

28:34.505 --> 28:37.077
I just want those who value
a natural setting.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.923
Fancy a sprint?

28:39.092 --> 28:40.290
- Fine.
- Good.

28:40.469 --> 28:41.383
- Ready?
- Yes.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.054
We're off!

28:44.473 --> 28:46.264
Did you put on weight?

28:46.433 --> 28:47.892
- What?
- You put on weight?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.471
What weight, man?

28:49.644 --> 28:52.100
My belly's declared independence.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.937
- Be careful. Don't let yourself go.
- What if I did?

28:56.985 --> 29:00.651
I've buried my wife.
I'm all alone.

29:01.073 --> 29:04.987
It's you who should be worried.
With a young, beautiful wife.

29:05.369 --> 29:09.746
If you don't look out, they'll be
asking if Nihal's your daughter.

29:09.915 --> 29:13.699
Come on. I'm not that bad.

29:13.877 --> 29:17.460
What about that mass suicide
around your hairline then?

29:18.382 --> 29:19.841
It's no big deal, but...

29:20.509 --> 29:23.593
You know that village, Garip,
near your farm...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.506
Yes, but I've never been.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.341
Whatever...

29:27.808 --> 29:31.342
A girl from the public education
office wrote to me.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.520
I don't usually care much
for that kind of thing.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.263
But for some reason, I was touched.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.850
Maybe I'm just getting old.

29:40.028 --> 29:44.489
I wanted to ask you
whether I should take it seriously.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.366
What's she after? A donation?

29:46.535 --> 29:50.403
Nothing much, the main thing is...

29:50.664 --> 29:51.613
Come in, Fatma.

29:51.790 --> 29:55.954
I couldn't make out if she's sincere
or after something else.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.251
Being a good judge of character,

29:58.422 --> 30:01.542
you'll easily see
what's what from the letter.

30:01.675 --> 30:02.706
I wanted to ask you.

30:02.927 --> 30:06.377
- Where shall I put your tea?
- On the table's fine.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.172
- Where is the letter?
- On the computer.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.556
- Read it out then.
- Right, listen.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.473
Thanks, Fatma.

30:20.777 --> 30:25.190
Nihal loves charity like this.
Should we call her as well?

30:25.490 --> 30:27.897
Go ahead. If you like.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.653
- We should, shouldn't we?
- Yes.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.371
I don't know if she's free.

30:42.633 --> 30:43.961
Nihal?

30:44.510 --> 30:46.667
Suavi's here,
we're discussing something.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.131
I was wondering
if you're free to join us.

30:50.306 --> 30:52.513
We need your opinion.

30:53.476 --> 30:55.350
Yes, we're in my study.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.263
Alright, dear.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.856
- She's coming.
- Good.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.818
Mr Suavi, how are you?

31:10.994 --> 31:13.153
Fine, thanks, and you?

31:13.413 --> 31:14.611
Fine, thank you.

31:14.789 --> 31:17.411
It's been a long time.
Are you doing OK?

31:17.584 --> 31:19.411
I'm fine. No problems.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.543
I don't leave the farm anyway.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.332
What problems could there be?

31:25.050 --> 31:27.089
How are your activities doing?

31:27.553 --> 31:29.925
As usual. The same old routine.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.888
But tell me what's your secret

31:32.056 --> 31:35.307
for looking younger
and more beautiful every time?

31:35.852 --> 31:38.604
That's very kind of you.
Thanks very much.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.898
How is your daughter?
Does she come to visit?

31:42.066 --> 31:43.727
Well, you know...

31:43.860 --> 31:46.186
She came once when she graduated.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.397
And when we lost her mother.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.854
That was it really.

31:50.034 --> 31:52.025
- She's still in London?
- Yes.

31:52.202 --> 31:55.286
Why don't you join her?
Why stay here all alone?

31:55.455 --> 31:56.286
Me?

31:56.456 --> 31:58.330
Heaven forbid.

31:58.458 --> 32:02.586
I can't stand that English husband
saying "Oh lovely" to everything.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.585
Just don't talk like that.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.422
So, let me tell Nihal.
I was saying to Suavi

32:09.594 --> 32:11.587
I got a letter the other day.

32:11.764 --> 32:16.057
A young girl who teaches needlecraft
in a local village.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.889
In short, she's asking for help.

32:19.313 --> 32:22.681
I'm not sure how to respond,
so I thought I'd ask you two.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.143
What kind of help does she want?

32:26.737 --> 32:29.192
Actually, the letter is here.
Shall I read it?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.063
Sure. Go ahead.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.412
Alright then, I will.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.243
Let me see.

32:44.713 --> 32:46.089
Yes, here it is.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.962
"Dear Mr Aydin,

32:51.135 --> 32:53.378
I would like you to know that...

32:53.555 --> 32:56.259
I am a great admirer of you
and your articles.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.268
I'm always eager
to read your weekly column

32:59.436 --> 33:01.559
in our local paper
"Voice of the Steppe",

33:01.729 --> 33:06.356
impatient to benefit from your vast
experience and courageous ideas.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.603
We, the teachers
at the Technical School for Girls,

33:10.781 --> 33:14.315
are proud that our town
has such a valued citizen."

33:15.618 --> 33:18.240
Blah, blah, we can skip all this.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.035
Yes... let's continue from there.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.497
"We, a group of teachers,

33:23.668 --> 33:26.954
wanted to build
a small building in Garip,

33:27.089 --> 33:31.585
one of the area's poorest villages
to teach crafts and writing

33:31.760 --> 33:34.333
to the women of the village.

33:35.055 --> 33:38.305
The mukhtar helped
as much as he could.

33:38.558 --> 33:42.223
However, despite all our efforts,
our resources ran out

33:42.395 --> 33:44.269
with the work not finished.

33:44.439 --> 33:48.389
We applied for support to the
municipality, but we were rejected.

33:48.568 --> 33:52.186
We have been left helpless, all alone
in the middle of this steppe,

33:52.364 --> 33:54.902
with all our good intentions
and hopes.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.451
While we sat disheartened
seeking a solution,

33:58.620 --> 34:02.831
I suddenly remembered your article
"Flowers of the Steppes".

34:02.999 --> 34:05.076
It felt as if you were describing us.

34:05.251 --> 34:09.498
Me and my friends read
that article again in tears.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.960
Believe me, my intention
is not emotional blackmail.

34:13.135 --> 34:17.677
I want you to know
that I would never feel ashamed

34:17.847 --> 34:22.141
to bow in front of a good person
like you to beg for help

34:22.310 --> 34:26.603
for the unfortunate people
of these arid steppes

34:26.773 --> 34:29.395
where I am proud to be born.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.145
I'll be brief.

34:31.820 --> 34:36.315
Since we heard about your connections
with the wealthy people of the region

34:36.491 --> 34:38.199
and the administration,

34:38.744 --> 34:44.696
and we know you are well connected,
even as far away as Istanbul,

34:45.375 --> 34:47.699
we wanted to tell you
of our situation.

34:47.877 --> 34:51.246
We would like to thank you,
however you respond.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.167
Yours sincerely."

34:59.348 --> 35:00.889
So, well...

35:01.307 --> 35:02.885
That's it.

35:04.144 --> 35:05.603
I don't know.

35:06.146 --> 35:10.772
She appears to be a well-intentioned,
decent, intelligent girl.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.612
Clearly an idealist,
bold and courageous.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.479
Seems like she deserves
some support.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.192
What do you think?

35:27.792 --> 35:28.871
Nihal?

35:32.381 --> 35:33.874
Frankly...

35:35.800 --> 35:38.125
it didn't sound to me very...

35:38.303 --> 35:40.841
I get this every day from all over.

35:41.890 --> 35:42.886
OK.

35:43.766 --> 35:46.803
What exactly didn't
sound right to you?

35:47.062 --> 35:48.224
Well...

35:48.522 --> 35:52.769
Isn't it a bit of a luxury
to build a new place just for this?

35:53.569 --> 35:55.691
It's a tiny village after all.

35:55.862 --> 35:59.445
Normally the mukhtar
gives a space for these things.

35:59.616 --> 36:03.150
You decorate it a bit and you manage.

36:04.538 --> 36:07.906
So I felt it sounded a bit too much.

36:08.082 --> 36:11.083
Even the municipality
refused to help them.

36:11.252 --> 36:15.796
We'll have a hard time finding
common sense in municipal decisions.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.088
Well, I don't know.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.094
And you, Suavi?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.350
I really don't know.

36:27.393 --> 36:31.261
Don't you think you and I,
and a few other local worthies

36:31.440 --> 36:33.231
could get together?

36:33.400 --> 36:35.688
Dear Aydin,
do I really look like a worthy?

36:35.819 --> 36:39.816
My belly is my only worthy feature,
and it's now independent.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.231
However,

36:44.953 --> 36:47.408
I must say
you surprised me, Nihal.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.361
Why?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.583
Well...

36:52.126 --> 36:57.121
Because thanks to you this hotel has
been run like a charity for years.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.922
What are you trying to say?

37:00.093 --> 37:01.172
Well...

37:02.762 --> 37:04.636
When a chronic philanthropist,

37:04.806 --> 37:08.140
who has helped
almost every school in the area,

37:08.309 --> 37:12.521
opposes this idea so firmly,
I fail to understand.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.563
What is there to understand?

37:14.858 --> 37:16.934
It's a matter of urgency.

37:17.110 --> 37:21.060
There are primary schools
with leaky roofs and rotten windows.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.156
Little kids studying
with their gloves on.

37:24.326 --> 37:27.659
Isn't it more logical
to solve these problems first?

37:28.747 --> 37:32.579
We've been collecting donations
for this for a long time now.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.539
But it never attracted
your attention.

37:35.711 --> 37:39.211
So I don't understand
your sudden charity.

37:42.344 --> 37:45.428
Anyway, I'm expecting guests.
I have to go.

37:45.847 --> 37:50.260
Mr Suavi, could you come and see me
for a minute before you leave?

37:50.435 --> 37:51.811
Sure. I'll drop by.

37:51.936 --> 37:55.056
Then I won't say goodbye.
See you shortly.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.991
You know what?

38:15.626 --> 38:19.458
All this poverty and hardship
is like a natural disaster.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.039
In a sense, it's the will of God.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.168
You can't oppose destiny.

38:26.722 --> 38:30.422
But God also gave us intelligence
to fight such things.

38:31.225 --> 38:32.341
That's true.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.138
That's true, however...

38:36.690 --> 38:40.474
there are people
specially created for such tasks.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.439
You should leave
these tasks to them.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.400
You're a creative man.
You are an artist.

38:46.575 --> 38:49.113
Why bother yourself with such things?

38:49.994 --> 38:52.071
Stick to your own work.

38:57.878 --> 38:59.585
Mr Aydin, Hamdi is here.

38:59.713 --> 39:02.251
- Who's Hamdi?
- Hamdi hodja, the imam.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.300
Fine, I was leaving anyway.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.010
Stay a little bit more.

39:07.386 --> 39:09.463
I have loads of work to do.

39:09.931 --> 39:12.802
Loads of work to do on the farm.

39:12.975 --> 39:15.930
I'll show Suavi out.
Bring Hamdi hodja in here.

39:16.104 --> 39:16.934
Alright.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.854
Welcome, Hamdi hodja.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.895
Thank you, Mr Aydin.

40:02.233 --> 40:05.400
You could've kept your shoes on.
It's not that clean.

40:05.612 --> 40:09.479
No, Mr Aydin. My shoes got muddy.
It's better like this.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.064
- Some slippers then.
- No, I'm fine.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.944
Hold on.
The floor is very cold in here.

40:22.002 --> 40:26.333
Fatma, bring me a pair of slippers.
And some tea and cookies.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.587
OK.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.086
Take a seat, Hamdi hodja.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.976
Yes, Hamdi hodja. I'm listening.

40:42.148 --> 40:45.730
To tell you the truth,
I don't know where to begin.

40:45.902 --> 40:49.567
When you came the other day,
it was a bit...

40:49.739 --> 40:50.854
Sorry, just a minute.

40:51.032 --> 40:54.116
It's a bit stuffy in here.
If you don't mind...

40:54.702 --> 40:56.362
I'll open a window.

41:02.377 --> 41:03.491
Yes?

41:04.170 --> 41:06.874
Honestly, I don't know how to put it.

41:07.299 --> 41:10.549
It was embarrassing for us,
I'm sorry, but...

41:10.718 --> 41:12.758
we didn't mean badly, of course.

41:12.929 --> 41:17.258
The kid made a mistake because
he was upset by what happened.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.759
But he's just a kid, after all.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.430
Of course, he is.

41:21.604 --> 41:24.641
But have you asked him why he did it?

41:25.149 --> 41:28.066
After all, the incident

41:28.236 --> 41:31.688
could have had
quite serious consequences.

41:32.866 --> 41:34.858
Yes, of course, I asked him.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.445
And what did he say?

41:38.455 --> 41:40.780
Well, Mr Aydin...

41:40.957 --> 41:43.413
the kid was upset
by the debt collector,

41:43.584 --> 41:46.289
so he went and did
such a stupid thing.

41:46.463 --> 41:49.666
Especially seeing his father
get beaten up.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.465
Beaten up?

41:51.635 --> 41:54.884
When the debt collectors came,

41:55.305 --> 41:59.005
Ismail tried to stop them obviously.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.259
And the police were there.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.517
So things got out of hand.

42:04.105 --> 42:06.144
I see.

42:07.817 --> 42:11.482
So our car paid the price, right?

42:11.654 --> 42:14.857
More or less, Mr Aydin. I apologize.

42:15.074 --> 42:18.490
But now the boy
feels really bad about it.

42:18.661 --> 42:22.113
He wants to come over
and kiss your hand for forgiveness.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.998
No. No need for that.

42:24.166 --> 42:26.872
He regrets it. Really.

42:27.211 --> 42:31.588
But as I said the other day,
we always pay our debts.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.000
I actually have some money now.

42:34.176 --> 42:37.380
So I came to pay for the car window.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.382
How much was it?

42:39.557 --> 42:42.392
It doesn't matter.

42:43.102 --> 42:47.563
Sort it out with Hidayet.
I don't know much about it.

42:47.731 --> 42:50.484
I think it was 70 liras or something.

42:50.652 --> 42:53.024
But it's best you talk with Hidayet.

42:53.362 --> 42:54.773
70 liras?

42:55.448 --> 42:58.651
70 liras for just one window?

43:00.244 --> 43:01.525
That's right.

43:02.288 --> 43:05.538
And it is not the brand-name one.
If it had been...

43:06.084 --> 43:08.918
Hidayet can show you the bill.

43:09.963 --> 43:11.208
Well...

43:12.131 --> 43:14.005
I'm not sure if I have enough on me.

43:14.133 --> 43:17.253
Let me just ask Hidayet
how much it was.

43:19.180 --> 43:22.181
It's no big deal.
There's no rush.

43:22.350 --> 43:26.597
After all, it's just a window.

43:28.148 --> 43:29.393
You think so?

43:29.941 --> 43:33.061
In that case,
I'd better not pay in installments.

43:33.235 --> 43:35.905
I'll pay it all in one go, then.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.070
Just to prevent any confusion.

43:39.575 --> 43:40.405
<i>Hello.</i>

43:41.244 --> 43:42.240
You there?

43:42.870 --> 43:47.579
Nothing, I just wanted to ask
how much the window cost.

43:47.750 --> 43:50.075
I remember you saying 70 liras.

43:52.839 --> 43:54.084
Really?

43:54.590 --> 43:57.757
I got it wrong then.
OK, alright.

43:58.428 --> 44:00.966
Fine, no problem. Never mind.

44:01.931 --> 44:05.679
I was wrong. It's 170, not 70.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.812
170 liras?

44:09.898 --> 44:11.475
But how come?

44:12.108 --> 44:13.851
That's how much it cost.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.979
Hidayet can show you the bill.

44:18.781 --> 44:21.652
I forgot to ask
if he took a bill though.

44:21.867 --> 44:23.610
That's strange.

44:24.537 --> 44:26.446
It's just a window.

44:26.831 --> 44:27.744
Really strange.

44:27.916 --> 44:31.534
There must be some mistake, surely.

44:38.134 --> 44:40.803
What's this?
Are there no men's slippers?

44:40.970 --> 44:43.342
No, we don't use any at the hotel.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.259
Fatma had these at home.

44:45.432 --> 44:50.011
No worries, these will do.
As long as they keep the cold off.

44:50.646 --> 44:52.604
Where shall I put the tea?

44:54.609 --> 44:57.182
Here. Let me move this.

44:58.070 --> 45:01.024
Hamdi hodja, come here.

45:09.164 --> 45:10.493
Thank you.

45:26.349 --> 45:29.303
Now, Hamdi, listen...

45:30.519 --> 45:34.352
I've got various houses and shops
in town.

45:34.524 --> 45:36.148
Not just mine actually...

45:36.317 --> 45:39.353
They're my sister Necla's too.

45:39.529 --> 45:42.731
If I tried
to look after them all myself,

45:42.907 --> 45:47.118
I'd have no time to work
on my book and articles.

45:47.495 --> 45:48.989
See what I mean?

45:49.205 --> 45:54.709
So I let Hidayet and the lawyers
deal with the rent and lawsuits.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.875
I often don't even know
what they're doing.

45:59.090 --> 46:01.545
And if they tell me,
I tend to forget.

46:02.301 --> 46:05.468
The other day,
your younger or older brother...

46:05.680 --> 46:06.961
Older.

46:07.181 --> 46:09.588
He said some inappropriate things.

46:09.851 --> 46:12.306
But I insist...

46:12.437 --> 46:13.930
not to mention the debt collectors.

46:14.605 --> 46:18.437
I wasn't even aware
you were my tenants.

46:19.151 --> 46:23.896
When the rent is not paid, lawyers
do these things automatically.

46:24.824 --> 46:25.689
Understand?

46:26.201 --> 46:28.987
Of course, Mr Aydin. It's obvious.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.326
You have to do these things.

46:31.497 --> 46:34.498
You've been very patient with us.

46:34.667 --> 46:38.249
But, since Ismail came out of prison,

46:38.421 --> 46:40.746
he hasn't sorted himself out yet.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.750
Nobody gives him a job.

46:42.925 --> 46:46.010
I don't see why not, but they don't.

46:46.470 --> 46:50.420
That's why we need time
to get back on our feet.

46:50.891 --> 46:54.724
So, Mr Aydin,
if you could just step in

46:54.937 --> 46:57.891
to stop the eviction...

46:58.065 --> 47:01.434
We will sort something out
as soon as possible.

47:01.611 --> 47:03.604
We really don't want
to lose the house.

47:03.779 --> 47:07.065
I spent my entire childhood
in that house.

47:07.616 --> 47:09.656
So if you could give us more time...

47:09.786 --> 47:12.193
What do you expect me to say?

47:12.371 --> 47:14.364
I see your point but...

47:16.375 --> 47:18.083
you need to discuss it with Hidayet.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.826
I don't know anything about it.

47:22.632 --> 47:23.876
Did you talk to him?

47:24.258 --> 47:26.084
- No.
- Talk to Hidayet.

47:26.469 --> 47:27.797
I mean...

47:28.053 --> 47:31.754
There's Hidayet and the lawyers.
You don't need to come to me.

47:31.974 --> 47:34.263
They know more about it.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.391
Don't come to me again.

47:39.065 --> 47:42.185
I don't want to mislead you.

47:47.115 --> 47:50.318
In a country
with a 99% Muslim population,

47:50.451 --> 47:53.405
don't the people deserve men of God

47:54.080 --> 47:55.657
who are cultivated, neat,

47:55.873 --> 48:00.001
whose very presence is reassuring?

48:01.504 --> 48:04.671
The weekly sermon
prepared by our imams,

48:04.840 --> 48:08.624
from their reading,

48:08.803 --> 48:11.804
will be heard
with pleasure and admiration

48:11.973 --> 48:13.882
and will elevate the people.

48:14.308 --> 48:18.602
Islam is a religion
of civilization and high culture.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.685
How's that?

48:27.863 --> 48:29.026
Fine.

48:29.574 --> 48:31.530
It's not too harsh?

48:31.742 --> 48:32.692
No.

48:33.035 --> 48:35.705
Nothing that might be misunderstood?

48:35.871 --> 48:36.618
No.

48:37.373 --> 48:40.409
You don't say anything
about religion itself.

48:40.834 --> 48:44.784
You talk about the practices
of those who apply it.

48:45.131 --> 48:48.546
And I also say
Islam is a religion of high culture.

48:48.718 --> 48:50.093
Of course.

48:50.511 --> 48:53.002
I don't really care for these things.

48:56.142 --> 48:57.885
But you know it's delicate.

49:00.104 --> 49:04.054
But the guy annoys me so much,
I can't stop myself writing.

49:04.733 --> 49:08.019
So he managed to become
the subject of an article.

49:08.278 --> 49:12.822
With his shabbiness,
slyness, vagueness...

49:13.367 --> 49:14.565
You know...

49:17.621 --> 49:21.571
I once played an imam in a play
and got good reviews.

49:21.751 --> 49:25.700
Now when I see him,
I tend to think I wasn't that good.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.916
I missed so many details.

49:30.551 --> 49:32.045
Did you see that play?

49:33.178 --> 49:34.721
Sorry? Which play?

49:34.889 --> 49:36.928
The one where I played an imam.

49:37.099 --> 49:38.723
"Wounded Birds".

49:39.143 --> 49:40.174
Can't remember.

49:40.478 --> 49:44.226
He comes running out in the
first scene, bursting for the toilet.

49:46.358 --> 49:49.146
It must have been when I was abroad.

49:49.319 --> 49:52.357
He comes running on:
"Where's the loo?"

49:53.365 --> 49:56.402
- No. Was it a comedy?
- Yes.

49:57.954 --> 50:00.788
- And first...
- I don't remember.

50:05.669 --> 50:07.247
I want to ask you something.

50:09.548 --> 50:11.754
Not resisting evil...

50:12.676 --> 50:13.707
What does that mean to you?

50:16.514 --> 50:17.593
What?

50:18.307 --> 50:22.435
Not resisting evil, I said.
What do you think that means?

50:23.896 --> 50:25.438
Not resisting evil?

50:26.815 --> 50:28.524
How do you understand it?

50:29.026 --> 50:30.355
Well...

50:30.527 --> 50:34.276
One day, thieves attack you
and you don't resist.

50:34.448 --> 50:36.072
I suppose that's it.

50:36.241 --> 50:39.906
I don't want an example.
Give me a logical definition.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.656
I wonder if there is any logic in it.

50:42.832 --> 50:45.536
A logical definition
of not resisting evil.

50:46.335 --> 50:48.078
Not resisting evil is...

50:49.463 --> 50:52.168
to remain indifferent
to incidents defined as evil

50:52.591 --> 50:55.343
within an ethical framework.

50:55.511 --> 50:56.673
How's that?

50:58.139 --> 51:00.096
For instance, if we were to...

51:00.474 --> 51:03.144
make this idea of not resisting evil

51:03.602 --> 51:05.595
the basis of our behavior,

51:05.771 --> 51:08.096
what kind of life would we have?

51:08.274 --> 51:10.148
What kind of life?

51:11.444 --> 51:12.854
What would it be like?

51:13.028 --> 51:15.270
Thieves, murderers, psychos
would prosper.

51:15.447 --> 51:18.199
Chaos would reign everywhere.

51:19.452 --> 51:21.693
- What would be left, then?
- Left?

51:22.496 --> 51:26.790
Cripples and madhouses.
How should I know?

51:28.002 --> 51:29.959
Maybe you're right.

51:30.129 --> 51:33.296
But I couldn't take the easy way out
like you.

51:34.133 --> 51:35.675
What easy way out?

51:35.842 --> 51:39.259
Maybe you should think about it.

51:39.430 --> 51:41.755
You went a bit too fast.

51:41.933 --> 51:44.305
I didn't. It's simple.

51:44.477 --> 51:47.643
Someone does wrong,
you don't resist. That's it.

51:47.813 --> 51:49.058
What else is there?

51:50.108 --> 51:51.306
I still feel...

51:51.483 --> 51:54.900
we're fooling ourselves
when we're fighting evil.

51:55.071 --> 51:58.937
As if we didn't want to look
at every aspect, we hide some.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.445
Like what?

52:01.451 --> 52:03.942
Fatma, this honey is frozen.
You got another?

52:04.121 --> 52:07.455
- I'll check.
- If not, just put it in warm water.

52:07.624 --> 52:11.753
Instead of struggling against evil,
why not do the exact opposite?

52:12.129 --> 52:15.000
Say you don't want
a painting to be stolen.

52:15.174 --> 52:18.092
It's maybe better
to hand it to the thief.

52:18.260 --> 52:20.253
Maybe it's a better solution.

52:20.429 --> 52:22.587
Say I want to marry an heiress

52:22.806 --> 52:24.764
because her father is rich.

52:25.142 --> 52:30.481
To foil my sneaky plot, she should
throw herself in my arms. Is that it?

52:30.940 --> 52:33.940
But maybe he would be ashamed,
feel remorse

52:34.068 --> 52:35.895
and admit his fault.

52:36.070 --> 52:37.730
Shouldn't we allow for that?

52:37.905 --> 52:39.648
What a ridiculous idea!

52:39.824 --> 52:44.285
Should we allow mass murders
because some killers could regret it?

52:44.995 --> 52:47.950
Even soaps don't
produce such nonsense.

52:48.123 --> 52:51.159
Well, I don't care what you think.
I have my solution.

52:51.877 --> 52:56.586
I see no reason to resist
an evil act aimed at me personally.

52:57.300 --> 53:00.217
Does someone want to kill me?
Be my guest.

53:01.303 --> 53:04.589
Because, if I were to defend myself,

53:05.182 --> 53:07.969
that wouldn't make
the murderer a better person.

53:11.022 --> 53:12.978
But if you defend yourself,
you may not die.

53:13.148 --> 53:14.393
Isn't that worth it?

53:14.734 --> 53:16.441
Trust me, it isn't.

53:17.194 --> 53:20.029
Let's drop it.
I feel depressed already.

53:20.406 --> 53:21.569
What do you think, Nihal?

53:21.740 --> 53:24.492
To be honest...
I don't quite grasp it.

53:24.660 --> 53:27.198
Where does this need come from?

53:27.371 --> 53:29.328
Why do you feel like this?

53:29.498 --> 53:32.618
It's not a need, just an idea.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.035
She wants to help evil get done.

53:35.212 --> 53:38.663
Hold on... Is that how you want
to end evil in the world?

53:38.841 --> 53:41.546
Or do you want
to find peace that way?

53:41.718 --> 53:45.419
She wants to help the baddies
do bad more comfortably.

53:45.597 --> 53:49.132
I'm just saying we should
give evildoers a chance

53:49.309 --> 53:51.053
to feel regret.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.387
A chance for the bad guys, great!

53:53.898 --> 53:55.689
You pretend not to understand.

53:55.858 --> 53:57.649
That's how I understood it, sweetie.

53:57.818 --> 53:59.443
How did you manage that, sweetie?

53:59.570 --> 54:03.153
She's saying evildoers regret it
if you help them do it?

54:03.324 --> 54:05.446
- No...
- That's what I understand.

54:05.618 --> 54:07.694
How can you understand that?

54:07.869 --> 54:09.578
So how do you understand it?

54:09.746 --> 54:13.116
It is very clear what she's saying.

54:13.334 --> 54:18.672
If someone does me harm,
a thief or someone...

54:18.839 --> 54:21.543
I don't resist and by doing so,

54:21.717 --> 54:23.341
stir his conscience...

54:23.510 --> 54:26.927
Stop it. What's got into you two
this morning?

54:27.097 --> 54:29.968
What's this about helping
evildoers do evil?

54:30.142 --> 54:31.517
Who said that?

54:31.685 --> 54:34.390
Is that how you plan to end evil?

54:34.563 --> 54:36.520
You're trying to provoke us now.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.478
I'm just saying what I understood.
Am I wrong?

54:39.651 --> 54:42.023
It's easy to understand.

54:42.195 --> 54:44.901
She says if something bad
is done to us,

54:45.074 --> 54:50.578
by not resisting, the evildoer
may be sorry and give up.

54:50.745 --> 54:52.121
Is that possible?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.949
That's not the question.

54:54.124 --> 54:55.951
I'm just saying one could try.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.796
So the Jews should deport themselves.

54:58.962 --> 55:00.919
So that Hitler doesn't get tired.

55:01.674 --> 55:04.758
He'd say "Here they are,
no point gassing them"?

55:04.927 --> 55:07.631
- You joking?
- No. That's what I understand.

55:08.388 --> 55:11.508
Help evildoers do evil
so they stop doing evil.

55:12.226 --> 55:13.601
Never heard such nonsense before!

55:13.810 --> 55:14.807
I misunderstand

55:15.812 --> 55:18.600
or you aren't making yourself
clear enough.

55:19.317 --> 55:20.229
Mr Aydin,

55:21.110 --> 55:22.390
they're here again.

55:22.569 --> 55:23.945
- Who?
- Hamdi.

55:24.113 --> 55:27.149
- What Hamdi? Hamdi hodja?
- Yes.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.862
- He's here?
- Yes, he's upstairs.

55:30.035 --> 55:31.744
What for?
He already came the other day.

55:32.121 --> 55:34.078
I don't know, he won't say.

55:34.248 --> 55:35.956
He's acting all mysterious.

55:36.125 --> 55:37.535
Not him, not now.

55:37.709 --> 55:39.536
Did you tell him I'm here?

55:39.670 --> 55:41.663
Of course not. I said I'd see.

55:41.838 --> 55:44.875
If he wants to leave something,
you take it.

55:45.050 --> 55:48.086
He came yesterday too.
He didn't leave anything.

55:49.930 --> 55:51.508
- Yesterday, too?
- Yes.

55:51.682 --> 55:52.678
Why didn't you tell me?

55:53.308 --> 55:54.719
We talked about it. You were in bed.

55:54.893 --> 55:57.052
You had me say you weren't in.

55:59.356 --> 56:00.186
Really?

56:00.357 --> 56:02.682
- That boy is here too.
- What boy?

56:02.984 --> 56:04.562
The window one.

56:05.362 --> 56:08.861
- He was here yesterday, too.
- I begin to smell trouble.

56:09.241 --> 56:11.993
Why not speak to him?
They've come all that way.

56:12.369 --> 56:13.744
What's so frightening?

56:13.912 --> 56:15.323
Nothing. It's not that, my dear.

56:15.497 --> 56:18.866
But he's whiney, annoying,
never finishes a sentence.

56:19.043 --> 56:22.328
But they're here now.
We can't send them away.

56:24.506 --> 56:26.416
Alright. Let them in.

56:26.592 --> 56:28.667
Let's see what he's after.

56:29.553 --> 56:32.340
I'll do it your way
to see if I got you right.

56:32.514 --> 56:33.629
Hamdi's coming.

56:33.807 --> 56:35.847
I'll say yes to everything he wants.

56:35.976 --> 56:39.309
- But he has done no evil to you.
- Maybe he will.

56:39.480 --> 56:42.350
We don't know why he's here yet.
But I won't protest.

56:42.524 --> 56:44.601
Evil or good, let's see...

56:44.776 --> 56:46.485
- A knife in his pocket?
- Who knows?

56:50.449 --> 56:52.406
Come in, Hamdi hodja, welcome.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.401
Welcome, Mr Hamdi.

56:55.579 --> 56:56.574
Thank you.

56:56.788 --> 56:59.541
Sorry for disturbing you
during breakfast.

56:59.749 --> 57:02.039
You're not disturbing us at all.

57:02.210 --> 57:04.119
Would you like some breakfast?

57:04.296 --> 57:07.499
Thank you, madam. We're not hungry.

57:07.675 --> 57:11.174
Please have a seat.
Fatma, some tea for our guests.

57:12.054 --> 57:13.429
And cookies for the boy.

57:13.597 --> 57:15.221
The valley is muddy.

57:15.390 --> 57:17.549
I'm sorry, we're covered in mud.

57:18.309 --> 57:19.769
Why were you in the valley?

57:19.979 --> 57:22.600
- Which way did you take?
- We took the shortcut.

57:22.772 --> 57:25.939
I saw two figures over there.
Was that you?

57:26.109 --> 57:27.438
- Probably.
- Really.

57:28.696 --> 57:31.103
You walked all the way from town?

57:32.032 --> 57:34.024
Yes, we did. Why?

57:34.701 --> 57:37.655
It's quite a long way.

57:39.331 --> 57:40.612
Yes, it's far.

57:41.125 --> 57:42.500
It is. Isn't it?

57:44.920 --> 57:47.624
Did you walk the last time too?

57:48.132 --> 57:49.791
I mean yesterday.

57:49.967 --> 57:51.212
Yes.

57:52.010 --> 57:53.338
My goodness.

57:53.512 --> 57:55.505
Why didn't you say so?

57:56.431 --> 57:59.136
Hidayet could have given you
a lift back.

57:59.726 --> 58:01.636
I feel sorry now.

58:01.812 --> 58:03.686
No need to apologize.

58:03.855 --> 58:07.474
It's like exercise for us.
Don't worry.

58:09.444 --> 58:11.271
Aydin, show them a seat...

58:12.239 --> 58:14.527
Fatma, bring my tea over there.

58:14.825 --> 58:16.864
Please have a seat.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.322
You don't even have a moped?

58:19.914 --> 58:23.282
I'll get one when things
start looking up.

58:23.459 --> 58:25.700
- That would be great.
- God willing.

58:25.877 --> 58:29.247
Luckily the house
is next to the mosque.

58:29.548 --> 58:33.380
Five round trips a day
would have been hard.

58:33.552 --> 58:35.046
God bless you.

58:35.471 --> 58:36.585
Is he your son?

58:36.764 --> 58:38.637
- He looks like you.
- No.

58:38.807 --> 58:41.380
He's my nephew.
My brother's son.

58:42.435 --> 58:44.060
I don't have any children.

58:44.230 --> 58:47.848
Struggling to make ends meet,
I couldn't get married.

58:48.275 --> 58:49.899
My fate, I guess.

58:50.068 --> 58:52.476
You will eventually.
You're still young.

58:52.654 --> 58:55.228
But Ilyas is like a son to me.

58:55.407 --> 58:58.159
Of course.
Which class are you in, Ilyas?

58:59.995 --> 59:01.738
Speak up, son, which grade?

59:02.664 --> 59:03.779
Fifth.

59:06.001 --> 59:06.747
Mr Aydin...

59:07.961 --> 59:09.621
I'm off to the industrial zone.

59:09.796 --> 59:12.798
- What for?
- To get the car door fixed.

59:12.966 --> 59:14.875
What's so urgent about it?

59:15.052 --> 59:17.340
Nothing.
But the engine too is making a noise.

59:17.512 --> 59:21.213
- What noise?
- A kind of "zheeee".

59:21.391 --> 59:25.436
Could be the cylinders.
I don't want to ruin the engine.

59:27.690 --> 59:29.231
Alright, go.

59:43.538 --> 59:45.329
Mr Aydin, as I said before...

59:45.540 --> 59:49.075
after that incident,
the boy felt terribly sorry.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.826
- Which incident?
- That stone he threw.

59:52.006 --> 59:53.749
That's over and done with.

59:53.924 --> 59:56.925
I mean... the poor boy feels so bad,

59:57.094 --> 01:00:00.677
he's been all upset
and worried ever since.

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:05.053
Now, Mr Aydin,
apologizing is not easy.

01:00:05.226 --> 01:00:08.477
As for repentance,
it's a matter of maturity.

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:11.316
But while there's still resentment,

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:14.056
one can't feel truly at peace.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:16.643
Our Prophet said,

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:19.313
"Repentance is penitence."

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:24.319
If a person convinces you
that they're really sorry,

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:29.075
then we have no choice
except to forgive them.

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.744
That's how it is.

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:34.833
And our Ilyas is such a smart
and golden-hearted boy

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:37.961
that young as he is, he listened to me.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.507
He thought about it and agreed.

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:43.348
That's why he wanted to come today

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:45.472
to kiss your hand.

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:47.968
I said, "That would be
the right thing, my boy."

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:53.685
"You'll see, show regret and
Mr Aydin will surely forgive you."

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:54.855
Right?

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:58.645
It's really not necessary.
It doesn't matter at all.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:01.693
Of course it's necessary.

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:06.279
Otherwise he'll get away
with what he's done.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:08.955
That's the biggest danger.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:11.580
Ilyas? Isn't that right, my dear?

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.374
I don't like getting my hand kissed.

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:17.374
My father never allowed it either.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.757
We'd struggle to kiss his hand.
Wouldn't we, Necla?

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.383
No. He can't find real peace then.

01:01:23.555 --> 01:01:25.179
Isn't that so, dear?

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:28.433
Come on now, son,
kiss Mr Aydin's hand.

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:38.315
Ilyas?

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:42.906
Didn't we say we'd go and do this
without telling your dad?

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.826
Don't embarrass me
in front of everyone.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:49.743
Come on, son. Kiss Mr Aydin's hand.

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:51.659
Fine, then.

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:05.294
Ilyas, come on.
Mr Aydin is waiting.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.077
Don't pull, keep it loose.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:30.964
Pull now.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.390
Let it rest a bit.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.369
Don't get too close.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.086
Wasabi.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.546
Oh my God. Brings tears
to your eyes, doesn't it?

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:13.386
In Japan also, hot is beautiful.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.266
You don't eat that in Japan.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:19.729
When I was a child, I didn't like it.

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:24.605
But just now, I love wasabi.

01:05:58.747 --> 01:06:00.574
Oh, it's freezing.

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:03.324
I'm chilled to the bone.

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:09.964
What are you doing?

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.003
Not much.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.430
Where's Aydin?

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:20.637
No idea.

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.936
Must have gone into town.
He's not in his room?

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:25.308
No, he isn't.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:51.042
I'll make more coffee.
Want some?

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.253
Coffee, I said, want some?

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.006
Yes, I'll have one.

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:03.641
I don't know what to do
with the new maid, Nihal.

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:06.433
She put glasses I love
in the dishwasher.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:07.982
Two got smashed.

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:09.477
I know, she told me.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:14.652
They're obviously too thin
for the dishwasher. They broke.

01:07:14.947 --> 01:07:18.198
I'm thinking of taking it out
of her wages to teach her.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:20.609
That's a bit much. Forget it.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:25.116
I'm not exaggerating.
There are things you love and value.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.952
I bought them in Istanbul.
You can't get them anymore.

01:07:29.129 --> 01:07:32.794
I know, but they're just glasses.

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:37.875
Maybe you're right. I don't know.

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.850
No, maybe you're right.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.563
I'm aware I'm a bit nervy lately.

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:57.316
It's because I worry too much.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.068
Worry about what?

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:03.037
There's so much going around
in my head.

01:08:05.207 --> 01:08:08.041
My ex has become a real alcoholic.

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:10.701
- Who? Necdet?
- Yes.

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:13.797
But he always drank a lot, didn't he?

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:16.090
He did indeed, but...

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:20.426
he's been drinking much more
since we separated.

01:08:21.139 --> 01:08:23.511
He starts the minute he gets up.

01:08:26.478 --> 01:08:28.885
But there's nothing
you can do about that.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:30.773
I know...

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.684
but sometimes...

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:37.399
I can't help thinking
we're worse off after splitting up.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:41.773
Him over there in that state,
me here miserable.

01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:44.822
- Is that what you really think?
- Well...

01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:51.288
Maybe I'm just trying to figure out
where I went wrong.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:53.627
What I did that made us
end up like this.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.836
But if you've still found nothing

01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:58.831
years later,
maybe it's not your fault at all.

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:01.006
Don't you agree?

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:03.173
You want me to join the herd

01:09:03.346 --> 01:09:07.048
that believes
all badness comes from others?

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:07.973
No.

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:11.312
But it still doesn't have to be
"your" mistake.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:12.975
That's what I'm saying.

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:15.978
Why do you never want
to think like that?

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.231
Because I don't see any good in it.

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:24.447
A sensible person should only be
interested in her own share of guilt.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:28.698
I see no harm in some self-deception
to protect yourself.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:30.912
But, well...

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.375
Where do you think you're wrong?

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:36.585
I don't know but...

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.462
I'm just saying it as an example...

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:45.798
If I'd overlooked all the evil stuff
Necdet did to me,

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.058
if I hadn't resisted,

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:54.637
if I hadn't divorced him, say.

01:09:57.526 --> 01:10:01.441
If I could have made him
face his own evil side.

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:03.234
I don't know.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:08.160
I wonder what would've happened
if I had acted differently.

01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:12.908
You mean, if you hadn't resisted
all the bad things he did,

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:15.753
he would've finally felt ashamed?

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:17.083
Yes.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:20.666
Yes. Exactly. You put it well.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:25.844
I know it sounds absurd,
but it isn't, believe me.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:30.135
Sorry, Necla, but I find it
hard to believe.

01:10:30.352 --> 01:10:33.851
People don't change that much
after a certain age.

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:38.233
On the contrary,
all their bad habits get even worse.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:41.613
So remaining silent
in the face of evil

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:46.696
does nothing but make the other
feel even more justified.

01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:49.324
I think he regrets it now, too.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.538
That's why I say this.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.415
I feel it.

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:59.708
If he could find an excuse,
he'd come here right away.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:04.341
If I were living somewhere else,
he'd definitely do that.

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:08.593
But after all that happened,

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.257
he is a bit scared of Aydin now.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.393
But you know
what I sometimes feel like?

01:11:22.194 --> 01:11:23.939
Going and asking him
for forgiveness.

01:11:25.657 --> 01:11:26.819
Necdet?

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:29.023
Yes.

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:33.537
But you did nothing wrong.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.165
Precisely.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:38.199
In fact, that's the beauty of it.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:41.167
Making the other really ashamed.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:45.126
And in this way,
maybe bringing out the good in him.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:54.965
Necla, have you been watching
too many soap operas recently?

01:11:56.604 --> 01:11:57.884
What do you mean?

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:00.355
Such things only happen there.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.937
There's nothing to say.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:06.822
It's your decision.

01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:09.321
I think it's utter nonsense,

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:14.035
but if that's what you want to do
nobody is going to stop you.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.039
You can do what you like.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:20.620
But then, you're the one
who has to face the consequences.

01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:22.753
Keep that in mind, too.

01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:25.002
That's how I see it.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:43.349
Those petty,
multiple-meaning, sarcastic words,

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.945
and those little,
cynical lip movements.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:52.234
I realize now how sick I am of it,
how much I hate it.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.945
Necla, you're going too far. Please.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.161
The real reason
I'd apologize to Necdet

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:01.749
is maybe to get away
from all of you and all of this.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.876
It's pretty clear now.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:08.334
Nobody is going to stop me?
Of course not.

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:11.334
I don't need
anybody's permission for that.

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.254
This is my father's house too.

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:16.639
I'll stay or go as I please.

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:20.224
Besides...

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:25.433
I've already paid the price
for telling the truth to your face.

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:29.020
A price none of you has paid.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:42.990
Isn't that

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:44.083
Omar Sharif?

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.451
What?

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:48.791
The photo. It's Omar Sharif?

01:13:48.967 --> 01:13:51.801
Yes. They shot a movie here.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.084
At this hotel?

01:13:53.263 --> 01:13:55.089
No, I mean in this area.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:57.429
He's such a humble man.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.722
He'd take a picture with anybody.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.181
- Really?
- Yes.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:03.845
You don't expect that of a big star.

01:14:04.024 --> 01:14:05.269
But he's not like that.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.350
What film was it?

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:10.821
I can't remember.
I don't want to mislead you.

01:14:11.322 --> 01:14:12.603
Hello.

01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:18.025
What was the movie
Omar Sharif shot here?

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.861
- "Monsieur Ibrahim".
- That's it.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.622
I've heard about it.
Where exactly did they shoot it?

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.749
Around here.
In Ishtar and other places.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.339
- Ishtar?
- Yes.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:30.882
Interesting.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:33.001
Let's see where it is.

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:37.841
Where is everybody?

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:43.305
You mean Mrs Nihal and Necla?
They were here a minute ago.

01:14:44.272 --> 01:14:45.470
Doing what?

01:14:45.607 --> 01:14:47.017
Talking.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.649
Here, in the lobby.

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:50.524
Really?

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.571
I went out and when I came back,
they'd left.

01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:56.025
Were they talking normally?

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:58.985
What do you mean "normally"?

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.575
Whatever.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.832
- Would you like some tea?
- Please.

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:07.793
Could you make us some tea?

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:15.547
Ishtar is very near.
Right opposite Akköy.

01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:18.970
No, I found it.
It's 20 kilometers away.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:22.095
Well done, you know better than us.

01:15:23.478 --> 01:15:24.806
No, I don't.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.065
What do you do?

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:30.853
I mean what's your job?
Are you a guide?

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.352
No, I'm not.

01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:35.519
I explore.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:38.656
Isn't a motorbike hard in winter?

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:41.322
The harder it is
the better we like it.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.371
Who's "we"?

01:15:44.249 --> 01:15:45.280
Motocross bikers.

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:46.916
I see.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.632
I did something like that
in my student days.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:54.796
Really?

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:57.458
Hitchhiked across Europe
with friends.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:16:01.848
When the going got tough
we hopped on a train.

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:04.925
Those were the days.

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:09.514
Sleeping wherever we ended up.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:13.269
The world was our oyster.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.396
It felt like life would never end.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.984
Full of the energy of youth.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.200
I don't care much for hitchhiking.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.202
I need to be more self-sufficient.

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:29.577
I should always have the gear
to get by.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.578
That's why a bike suits me better.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:36.210
So you check into a hotel
for the night?

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:40.428
I have a tent and stuff
but I didn't want to pitch it here.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.882
This place is a bit like a cave

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:45.885
and natural like a tent.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:49.260
And I also had some stuff to write.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:50.980
Really? What are you writing?

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:52.607
My experiences.

01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:55.527
Like a travel journal?

01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:58.648
There are travel notes as well.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.699
Let's call them essays.

01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:03.569
Soon to be published as a book.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:05.660
Really? That's good.

01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:09.706
I'm writing a book, too.

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:11.584
Really?

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:14.711
It will be a serious, thick book.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.923
History of Turkish Theatre.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.961
There is no serious study
on the topic.

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:25.130
Unfortunately.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:28.267
So I'm doing research.
There's loads to read.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:31.051
Old documents, articles,
books and so on.

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:34.599
I've nearly finished, all I have
to do now is start writing.

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:39.686
- "Getting started is half the job".
- That's true.

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:45.032
- You used to be an actor, I believe.
- That's right.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:46.827
That explains your topic.

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:48.159
Yes, that's right.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.738
I prefer the term 'thespiar though.

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:54.250
Acting has fallen from grace
a little lately.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:57.251
I was on stage for 25 years.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:01.541
And I am proud to say
I never did any soap operas.

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:04.924
Despite some very attractive offers.

01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:10.721
I remember something
Omar Sharif told me.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:13.895
When we met,
he learned I was an actor.

01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:16.436
He gave me this look and said,

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:20.609
"Acting is all about honesty."

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.697
It really is.

01:18:25.493 --> 01:18:26.655
Awesome.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:33.078
- By the way, we got a horse.
- Really?

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.661
Can I ride it now?

01:18:34.836 --> 01:18:36.627
Not yet. It has to settle in
a few days.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:39.252
How long will you be staying?

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:40.751
- Here?
- Yes.

01:18:41.174 --> 01:18:42.373
Don't know.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.129
I haven't decided yet.

01:18:44.846 --> 01:18:46.470
I live from day to day.

01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:49.308
I don't plan ahead much.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:53.019
Otherwise it's not
a real journey anymore.

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:55.856
You lose the sense of adventure.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.851
How can I put it?

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:04.069
The way a well-planned life
doesn't feel like a real life.

01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:05.692
As the saying goes,

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:09.365
life passes by
while we're busy making plans.

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:12.954
True. Very true.

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.994
Weren't you going to the market
with Fatma?

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:04.041
I told Fatma to go.
I didn't feel like it.

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:12.217
Have you finished
the book I lent you?

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:15.809
A while ago.

01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:17.801
So?

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:20.518
What did you think?

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:22.858
Worth translating?

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.321
No, I don't think
it's worth the bother.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:42.419
If I'm not interrupting,
can I ask you something?

01:20:42.587 --> 01:20:48.093
Of course. But please,
nothing about not resisting evil, OK?

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:51.963
I found a good source.

01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:55.056
I should finish this
and send it quick.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:21:00.054
Judging from your excitement,
you struck gold.

01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:01.773
Not really.

01:21:02.233 --> 01:21:06.183
It's a sequel to my previous article.
It aroused lots of interest.

01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:08.648
- Really?
- Yes.

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.109
So Vehbi said.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.905
He said the paper got
abusive phone calls.

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:20.996
You know Vehbi.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.749
He loves to exaggerate reactions

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:26.921
to make his paper look influential.

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:29.999
The article wasn't provocative.

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:33.797
I agree, but...

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.680
I'm not so sure.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:41.555
Why do you get involved
in such things in the first place?

01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:45.524
You're an actor.
Write what you know about.

01:21:46.276 --> 01:21:49.610
But dear Necla, often
you don't choose what you write.

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.572
In a sense,
the subject chooses you.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.698
Of course everyone has the right to
talk or write about what they like.

01:21:57.163 --> 01:22:01.374
But you have to accept that
the product will match its maker.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:02.573
Meaning?

01:22:02.752 --> 01:22:06.584
I mean there will be a big difference
between the views

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.499
of a lifelong expert

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:10.168
and an amateur's.

01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:14.043
But can't an outsider
sometimes see things more clearly?

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:16.131
Frankly, not in this case.

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.677
Which case?

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:21.424
Let me put it like this.
The other day...

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:24.141
I carefully read that article
you gave me.

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:27.268
Then I couldn't stop
and read some others.

01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:28.647
And?

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:32.945
I probably hadn't paid
enough attention before...

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:35.317
but they felt quite different
this time.

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:37.612
Different in what sense?

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:39.617
I don't know.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:42.869
Has Nihal read them?

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.210
No, I don't think so.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.750
She doesn't care much
for my articles.

01:22:48.214 --> 01:22:50.586
Shouldn't a wife read
what her husband writes?

01:22:51.759 --> 01:22:53.585
I don't know. Should she?

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.545
Maybe she reads them in secret.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:57.884
I believe she does.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:03.427
She's an expert at criticizing
by remaining silent.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:07.096
I don't believe she'd be
objective enough anyway.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:08.436
Whatever.

01:23:09.609 --> 01:23:11.649
- So?
- Well, honestly,

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:14.567
I probably couldn't be so daring.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.068
About what?

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:18.439
I mean...

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:23.496
Pontificating in a column
on matters I don't know much about.

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.410
Pontificating?

01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:29.749
I see you found my articles
worse than I thought.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:33.337
No. I'm not saying they're bad...

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.133
It's something else.

01:23:36.304 --> 01:23:37.549
Something else?

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.714
Like what?

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.425
I mean, they're like...

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:46.433
Mediocre? Bloodless?

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:48.432
I can't find the right term.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:50.018
Harmless.

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.900
Is that what you mean?

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.188
I don't know. Maybe.

01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:00.984
Your words are sweeter
than honey today.

01:24:01.746 --> 01:24:03.903
I'm trying to be realistic.

01:24:04.332 --> 01:24:06.323
Well, bravo, what else can I say?

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:09.575
If you want,
I can stop being realistic.

01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:16.042
Too late.
The genie is out of the bottle.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:19.545
Well, if you ask for opinions

01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:22.213
you have to face the consequences.

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:24.882
What can I say? That's true.

01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:34.815
In the old days, we admired you.

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:39.948
We thought

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:43.367
you'd do great things,
become quite famous even.

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:47.241
But it didn't happen.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:52.374
The elephant gave birth to a mouse.

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:57.004
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:24:57.176 --> 01:24:59.583
That's obviously not your fault.

01:25:01.138 --> 01:25:03.464
It's us who set the bar so high.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.595
So I should feel comforted.

01:25:08.312 --> 01:25:10.719
What about
"Flowers of the Steppes"?

01:25:11.357 --> 01:25:12.387
What did you think of it?

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:14.357
To be honest,

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:18.311
that's the article that actually
made me think like this.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:22.860
Really? In what way?

01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:26.826
How can I put it?
This soppy romanticism.

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:31.160
This naïve, unconvincing self-belief.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:33.330
Takes no risks, for one thing.

01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:36.498
It looks like the writer

01:25:37.215 --> 01:25:40.549
adopts positive values
accepted by all,

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:42.677
just to endear himself.

01:25:43.513 --> 01:25:45.756
Sometimes the disguise of lyricism

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:49.349
makes it stink of sentimentality.

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.769
You really are annoyed.

01:25:53.941 --> 01:25:56.230
I must confess
I don't like this style much.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:26:00.234
If what you say is true,
I should just quit writing.

01:26:01.282 --> 01:26:04.152
No, dear.
This is just my point of view.

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:07.909
Luckily not everybody
thinks like you.

01:26:08.789 --> 01:26:10.449
Naturally.

01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:15.455
Who are they?

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.880
I see you're curious.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:21.873
No. It's just because
you mentioned it.

01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:26.673
- I haven't offended you, have I?
- Not at all.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:28.927
Are you sure?

01:26:33.022 --> 01:26:34.397
Maybe a little.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:39.183
A writer can be very sensitive
regarding his work.

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:41.895
But don't worry, I can handle it.

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:46.366
But dear, you're not coming up with
coherent, constructive criticism.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.987
Like your remarks
are always hiding something.

01:26:50.163 --> 01:26:51.788
That's what's annoying.

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:57.296
So I get to thinking
it's me you hate, not the articles.

01:26:57.463 --> 01:26:58.411
That's absurd.

01:26:58.589 --> 01:27:00.213
But that's the case.

01:27:00.508 --> 01:27:02.796
And of course,
we've become very different now.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.635
We must accept that.

01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:07.674
We see things,
life itself, quite differently.

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:11.343
That's probably natural.

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:15.219
The older you get,
the more particular, rigid you get.

01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:19.731
After a while, it seems normal
you don't like them.

01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:22.693
That's maybe how it should be.

01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:26.991
In fact, this might even be something
I should be pleased about.

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:27.989
You see?

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:29.654
Anyway...

01:27:29.829 --> 01:27:32.663
I don't want to go into it
any further.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:40.879
It's incredible how you always
float to the surface like olive oil.

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.460
You find a way
to justify yourself, as usual.

01:27:44.635 --> 01:27:47.007
Necla, please, can we drop it?

01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:50.299
You wanted to ask me something
when you came in.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:51.761
It's done.

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:54.305
No. What were you going to ask?

01:27:55.478 --> 01:27:59.062
The subject of the article
you've just sent.

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:00.976
No, it wasn't that.

01:28:01.569 --> 01:28:03.110
Yes, that's what it was.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:07.987
OK. Religion, morals, this and that.
Nothing of your interest.

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:09.818
Now I see.

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:14.195
You found a victim
and you're making the most of it.

01:28:14.373 --> 01:28:16.080
Stop harassing the poor man.

01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:17.874
Necla, I'm losing my temper.

01:28:18.085 --> 01:28:19.460
What does it have to do with it?

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:23.329
I should ask what religion, faith,
spirituality have to do with you.

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:26.498
Have you ever set foot in a mosque?

01:28:26.676 --> 01:28:29.048
Have you ever prayed
so that you can talk about it?

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:32.257
Do I have to go to a mosque
to write about religion?

01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:33.511
How absurd is that?

01:28:33.684 --> 01:28:37.218
You keep saying the imam's
feet stink. What's it to you?

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:41.016
The man walked 10 km in this cold.

01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:44.192
And he had to enter the room
with those feet.

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:46.859
What exactly are you trying to say?

01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:49.569
You know damn well what I'm saying.

01:28:50.159 --> 01:28:51.486
No, I don't.

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:52.905
Then let me explain.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:56.412
I find it insincere
to talk about spirituality

01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:59.417
when you haven't shed
a single tear on your parents' grave

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:01.660
and never even visited them.

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:04.873
There are ways of crying
you don't know, Mrs Necla.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.338
Fine, alright. Go on then.

01:29:11.387 --> 01:29:15.053
I wish my threshold of self-deception
was as low as yours.

01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:19.893
Then I could easily find
things worth doing

01:29:20.064 --> 01:29:22.732
and escape this boredom perhaps.

01:29:24.735 --> 01:29:26.312
I don't understand

01:29:26.486 --> 01:29:29.772
how you don't get fed up
harping on like that.

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:34.782
Applying yourself, being persistent

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:39.865
is a precondition to penetrating
deeper and creating new things.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:42.955
Second, what boredom
are you talking about?

01:29:44.338 --> 01:29:47.956
I've never had a spare second
to feel bored.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:53.381
And in the present circumstances,
I believe boredom is quite a luxury.

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.592
So it wasn't a luxury in the past
and now it is?

01:29:56.767 --> 01:30:01.643
Fine, I'll put it like this.
Boredom is always a luxury. Happy?

01:30:03.524 --> 01:30:07.437
We are so different,
we have such opposite souls.

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:10.149
It's hard to believe we're related.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:13.738
That's normal.
Siblings are never alike.

01:30:13.909 --> 01:30:17.075
If one is hardworking,
the other is lazy. One is clever,

01:30:17.246 --> 01:30:19.997
the other is a fool. One is sociable,
the other introverted.

01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:21.540
That's just how it is.

01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:23.950
- So?
- So it's normal.

01:30:25.379 --> 01:30:26.659
I can't believe

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.622
how I left a place like Istanbul

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:35.508
and agreed to come and live with you.

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:39.968
My soul's withering here.

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:43.805
I feel at home
wherever my room and my books are.

01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:45.854
I feel no need for another place.

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:50.686
You must be able to create a world
for yourself, find an occupation.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:55.320
You're bored
because you sit around doing nothing.

01:30:55.492 --> 01:30:56.820
You've really let yourself go.

01:30:56.994 --> 01:30:58.951
You used to do translations.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.663
You stopped even that.

01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:02.206
Of course you're bored.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:04.165
We must work, have a passion.

01:31:05.043 --> 01:31:09.123
You know what they say, an idle life
is far from honor and honesty.

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:14.504
It depends on how
you define "working".

01:31:14.677 --> 01:31:18.461
It doesn't mean
running around pointlessly.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.716
So what does it mean?

01:31:21.477 --> 01:31:24.928
People who think a lot are actually
more active than the others.

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:26.434
Even if they don't do anything.

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:29.975
So you mean you're busy thinking.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:34.145
Maybe I don't know what to do.

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:37.323
I've no passion
to give me direction.

01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:39.902
But then, what do you do?

01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:45.120
You waste your best years with things
that are irrelevant to you.

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:49.329
Are you not tired of tinkering
uselessly, like an alchemist?

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:56.463
Seeing you like this
depresses me.

01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:59.426
Necla, what are you raving about,
for God's sake?

01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:01.930
You having a bad night or what?

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:04.680
The more I try to humor you,
the harsher you get.

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:07.141
- Calm down.
- Come on, please.

01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:10.606
I'm not surprised you got divorced
after all these years.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:14.476
No man would put up with
this sharp tongue of yours.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:19.071
It takes one to know one, so true.

01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:20.238
What do you mean?

01:32:21.661 --> 01:32:24.117
- Well...
- Who are we talking about?

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:27.873
Your other half.
You're becoming both the same.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:30.712
You have to get at Nihal too, right?

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:35.212
I know what you two think of me.
But I don't care.

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:38.468
These are my own thoughts,
nothing to do with Nihal.

01:32:38.637 --> 01:32:41.922
She walks around
like she was a guardian angel,

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:44.305
but in reality, she doesn't do shit.

01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:47.726
Glaring at people
with that contemptuous look.

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:50.018
Are we now guilty
because you do nothing?

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:53.482
Do something. Nobody's stopping you.

01:32:55.445 --> 01:32:59.110
Charity's now what they call
showing off in this house.

01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:04.614
The salvation ritual of a woman
who's never earned her living.

01:33:04.788 --> 01:33:06.246
God knows what salvation.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.621
What do you want her to do?

01:33:08.791 --> 01:33:12.291
Philanthropy isn't tossing
a bone to a hungry dog.

01:33:12.963 --> 01:33:15.667
It's sharing it
when you're just as hungry.

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:20.718
Everybody does what he can,
how he can. What's wrong with that?

01:33:20.887 --> 01:33:24.338
Ask yourself what you get
from this kind of work.

01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:27.054
You're not listening.
What's that got to do with it?

01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:31.936
Others found what you're digging for
in that hole years ago.

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:35.061
Stop flogging a dead horse.

01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:38.236
It's a waste of time.
Nothing new will come of it.

01:33:39.031 --> 01:33:41.865
So you tell me then.
What is "new"?

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.489
You are the man of ideas, not me.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:45.859
I can't teach you.

01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:49.287
I'm interested in the universal,
even if it might not seem new.

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:50.323
For God's sake, Aydin.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:53.371
Be realistic for once. Please.

01:33:53.837 --> 01:33:55.628
Just this once.

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:58.004
Look who's talking about realism.

01:33:58.174 --> 01:34:01.128
Dealing with art, struggling
for people's spiritual development

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:03.260
is alchemy, you say?

01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:05.422
No, dear, what I'm saying is this.

01:34:05.598 --> 01:34:09.513
If all you thinkers thought
about solving the big problems,

01:34:09.685 --> 01:34:14.312
all this trivia you fuss about now
would solve itself in the process.

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:17.563
If you go up in a balloon
to see a town,

01:34:17.736 --> 01:34:20.653
you'll incidentally see the trees,
rivers and meadows too.

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:24.026
But no, you focus on one tiny spot.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.110
Lazy, cowardly, conservative.

01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:30.112
We're in an endless cycle again.

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:33.451
We don't have to agree.
Why do we keep arguing?

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:35.536
You know what your problem is?

01:34:35.712 --> 01:34:39.924
In order not to suffer,
you prefer to fool yourself.

01:34:40.092 --> 01:34:42.083
Yes, that's it.

01:34:42.552 --> 01:34:46.799
But one has to have the courage
to face the truth.

01:34:46.974 --> 01:34:49.678
If you're looking
for something more real,

01:34:49.851 --> 01:34:54.928
you'll have to be destructive
when necessary, dear Aydin.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:00.944
But since you're an actor, you forgot
about being real, being yourself.

01:35:02.655 --> 01:35:06.523
You jump from one personality
to another, just like a grasshopper.

01:35:06.827 --> 01:35:10.076
But there's something called
living with yourself.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:13.663
So, you want me to be realistic?
Alright, listen, then.

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:17.878
You're a person sentenced
to Ioneliness and boredom for life.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:20.797
Because you're a coward,
because you're lazy.

01:35:21.133 --> 01:35:22.413
- Me?
- Yes.

01:35:22.592 --> 01:35:26.211
You're used to living like a parasite
expecting everyone to help you.

01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:30.220
You act as if the whole world
owes you something.

01:35:30.392 --> 01:35:32.349
- Easy, calm down.
- I'm calm.

01:35:32.518 --> 01:35:36.184
Whatever you do, whatever you say,

01:35:36.356 --> 01:35:38.064
you expect indulgence.

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:41.732
- You think that's possible?
- That's certainly not what I want.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.562
Where do you get such ideas?

01:35:44.947 --> 01:35:48.731
You're not realistic yourself
without being aware of it.

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:50.405
- Me?
- Yes.

01:35:50.996 --> 01:35:52.371
Wonderful.

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:56.372
I swear, every time
you come through that door,

01:35:56.543 --> 01:36:00.790
I find myself praying
you won't say something irritating.

01:36:01.797 --> 01:36:04.371
While you sit silently behind me,

01:36:04.551 --> 01:36:08.596
I feel your gaze on my back, seeking
trouble, just to escape boredom.

01:36:09.139 --> 01:36:10.763
My back goes numb.

01:36:12.142 --> 01:36:13.635
I've got unsuspected powers.

01:36:13.810 --> 01:36:18.306
It's as if somebody is rubbing
his calloused hand on my back.

01:36:18.857 --> 01:36:21.526
I feel cold inside, I can't write.

01:36:21.692 --> 01:36:23.769
Aydin, what are you saying?

01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:26.691
Do you always have to be
that irritating?

01:36:28.241 --> 01:36:29.189
You're angry.

01:36:29.367 --> 01:36:31.609
Look, this drives everybody away.

01:36:31.786 --> 01:36:35.831
No husband, no friend, nobody.
You're left all alone.

01:36:37.167 --> 01:36:38.709
Am I wrong?

01:36:39.961 --> 01:36:43.295
Is that realistic enough,
or shall I continue?

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:47.296
Yes, that was a very
personal realism. You're right.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:50.711
Thinking more important than action.

01:36:53.266 --> 01:36:54.760
There we go.

01:36:55.227 --> 01:36:57.931
The age-old excuse
of cowards and slackers.

01:36:58.104 --> 01:37:00.013
Are you counting on that?

01:37:01.816 --> 01:37:04.058
Marvelous tirade.

01:38:14.097 --> 01:38:15.840
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:17.973
- How are you?
- I'm alright, thanks. How are you?

01:38:18.142 --> 01:38:19.803
I'm fine, thank you.

01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:23.059
I want to check out. Just now.

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:24.642
Oh, really?

01:38:24.816 --> 01:38:30.770
Because we want to leave
tomorrow morning so early.

01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:33.364
You're leaving already.

01:38:33.824 --> 01:38:37.158
- I see. So soon?
- Well, sorry.

01:38:37.329 --> 01:38:40.613
- We're going to miss you.
- Thank you.

01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:43.363
- Did you enjoy your stay here?
- Yes, of course.

01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:44.959
Did you have a nice time?

01:38:45.128 --> 01:38:48.461
Yes. I'm so... I'm very happy
to stay here.

01:38:48.632 --> 01:38:50.209
It's a very nice room.

01:38:50.383 --> 01:38:52.376
Good, good. I'm glad.

01:39:57.199 --> 01:39:58.860
- How are you, man?
- Hey, how are you?

01:39:59.034 --> 01:40:00.660
I didn't know you were coming.

01:40:01.287 --> 01:40:02.746
I invited Mr Suavi.

01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:04.906
So I figured.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:07.458
Is there a celebration?

01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:10.880
No, we're just having a meeting.

01:40:11.047 --> 01:40:12.707
- A meeting?
- Yes.

01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:17.128
What's the mystery?
Is it an army council meeting?

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:19.386
Didn't I tell you? I did.

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:21.092
When?

01:40:22.808 --> 01:40:25.560
I don't know, but I did.
You said "hmm" or something.

01:40:25.687 --> 01:40:28.225
It was odd
that you weren't interested.

01:40:28.606 --> 01:40:31.642
I said "hmm"? I don't remember.

01:40:32.651 --> 01:40:35.855
Never mind. It's nothing to do
with you anyway.

01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:37.608
As if you didn't know.

01:40:43.329 --> 01:40:44.740
- Nihal.
- Yes?

01:40:44.914 --> 01:40:46.706
Where exactly did you tell me?

01:40:46.875 --> 01:40:48.249
I don't remember.

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.337
You heard,
it's none of your business!

01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:58.298
Shall I take your coat, Mr Aydin?

01:41:01.097 --> 01:41:02.176
Where's Necla?

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:04.264
In her room.

01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:06.339
Why? Is she upset?

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:09.099
No. Do you want me to go and see?

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:10.814
No. Did she come down today?

01:41:10.982 --> 01:41:12.856
Probably.

01:41:13.026 --> 01:41:15.101
In what sense you ask?

01:41:16.112 --> 01:41:17.820
Nothing. Off you go.

01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:22.816
So?

01:41:23.286 --> 01:41:25.611
I thought you never went out.

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:27.283
I don't really.

01:41:27.456 --> 01:41:30.956
Nihal called me,
I couldn't say no.

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:37.621
Listen...

01:41:37.842 --> 01:41:40.000
Don't let them fleece you.

01:41:40.178 --> 01:41:42.716
They're insatiable.
And you can't say no.

01:41:42.847 --> 01:41:45.634
Look at me.
Do I look that gullible?

01:41:46.059 --> 01:41:48.514
I'm just warning you.
You're an old friend.

01:41:48.686 --> 01:41:51.438
Don't regret it later
and take it out on me.

01:41:51.606 --> 01:41:53.681
Fatma, could you get me a coffee?

01:41:53.858 --> 01:41:55.767
I'll have a coffee and leave.

01:41:55.944 --> 01:41:59.988
- Why do you have to go? Stay.
- No, I don't fancy it.

01:42:00.489 --> 01:42:03.609
- Why don't you stay for a while?
- No thanks.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.171
- Welcome, Levent.
- Hello, everyone.

01:42:21.344 --> 01:42:23.003
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:24.210
Give me your coat.

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:28.089
Teacher, where were you?
I was about to leave.

01:42:28.268 --> 01:42:31.968
At the army office.
The commandant's wife was there.

01:42:32.147 --> 01:42:32.892
So?

01:42:33.022 --> 01:42:35.513
People are nice
to their wives in public.

01:42:35.692 --> 01:42:37.933
But given the chance,

01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:42.440
they'd stuff them in bags
and throw them in the water.

01:42:45.034 --> 01:42:47.276
Hello. I'm Aydin, Nihal's husband.

01:42:47.453 --> 01:42:51.285
Are you? Nice to meet you.
I'm Levent, the teacher.

01:42:51.458 --> 01:42:53.533
- I guessed so.
- Really? How?

01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:56.415
You come often.
I've heard about you.

01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:59.160
I'm not sure what you're doing...

01:42:59.632 --> 01:43:02.751
Mrs Nihal could explain it better,

01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:08.897
but we're collecting donations
to renovate disadvantaged schools.

01:43:09.476 --> 01:43:12.891
Since Mrs Nihal joined,
we've made a lot of progress.

01:43:13.062 --> 01:43:15.767
- That's nice. Bravo.
- Thank you.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.063
Friends, why don't you sit down?

01:43:18.234 --> 01:43:19.432
Please.

01:43:24.657 --> 01:43:27.362
Levent, what would you like to drink?

01:43:27.535 --> 01:43:32.031
Some of your famous
coffee liquor, please.

01:43:32.206 --> 01:43:34.531
Of course. Anyone else?

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:36.283
Mr Suavi?

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.583
Me too, but later.

01:43:41.465 --> 01:43:44.336
I'll have a tea, Nihal. Thanks.

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:53.637
Listen, Bülent.

01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:56.219
How many local primary schools
are there?

01:43:56.397 --> 01:43:58.473
Levent, not Bülent.

01:44:00.776 --> 01:44:03.232
There are three in the center.

01:44:03.404 --> 01:44:05.064
And how many pupils?

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:08.075
Well, we have 75...

01:44:08.576 --> 01:44:11.150
plus 150 there.
250-300 in all. Why?

01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:14.745
That's not many.
I thought there would be more.

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.956
Look, it's snowing!

01:44:19.461 --> 01:44:22.747
If it goes on, it'll be difficult
to drive up the slope.

01:44:22.924 --> 01:44:23.919
Aydin...

01:44:25.426 --> 01:44:29.091
Can you come? There's a problem
with a light in the kitchen.

01:44:29.972 --> 01:44:31.431
Coming.

01:44:41.442 --> 01:44:44.277
Which one is it? This one?

01:44:45.029 --> 01:44:48.196
Sorry, that was just an excuse
to bring you here.

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:52.324
Now, don't take it badly but...

01:44:52.495 --> 01:44:55.745
I must say this is a private meeting.

01:44:56.999 --> 01:44:58.078
So?

01:44:58.876 --> 01:45:03.004
In this meeting,
we'll try to finalize

01:45:03.464 --> 01:45:06.667
months of effort.

01:45:08.219 --> 01:45:09.298
So?

01:45:11.305 --> 01:45:13.132
I'll have to ask you
to leave us alone.

01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:16.218
Discuss whatever you like.

01:45:16.811 --> 01:45:18.768
Are you hiding something from me?

01:45:18.938 --> 01:45:21.144
It's not a matter of secrecy.

01:45:22.858 --> 01:45:26.192
But Nihal, don't you think
you're being a bit impolite?

01:45:26.362 --> 01:45:28.070
Why "impolite"?

01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:31.525
All I'm saying is
that this is a private meeting.

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:34.274
Nobody in this country
would believe it.

01:45:34.453 --> 01:45:36.659
Men everywhere
but the husband banned.

01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:38.490
Don't be ridiculous.

01:45:38.666 --> 01:45:42.366
There are women inside.
And some more will come.

01:45:42.545 --> 01:45:46.245
But with you around,
things get complicated, that's all.

01:45:46.424 --> 01:45:48.499
You stick your nose into everything.

01:45:49.427 --> 01:45:52.713
Just let us do things our own way.

01:45:53.723 --> 01:45:57.850
If I organized a meeting like this
and you came in,

01:45:58.019 --> 01:46:01.138
I'd never treat you like this.

01:46:02.273 --> 01:46:04.349
I really don't get it.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.024
It's beyond my understanding.

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:09.187
We've been working for a year now.

01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:13.907
You never showed the slightest
interest and you show up at the end.

01:46:14.076 --> 01:46:16.152
I'm the one who doesn't get
what you're after.

01:46:16.329 --> 01:46:17.822
I'm not after anything.

01:46:29.175 --> 01:46:32.211
I'd have soon got it and left anyway.

01:46:33.429 --> 01:46:36.596
What makes me angry is your nerve

01:46:37.141 --> 01:46:38.968
to actually tell me this.

01:46:39.185 --> 01:46:41.592
I didn't say it in front of people.

01:46:41.771 --> 01:46:45.305
I asked you to come here
and I'm asking you nicely.

01:46:46.108 --> 01:46:47.389
What else can I do?

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:49.027
I don't know.

01:46:49.612 --> 01:46:52.862
But I know very well that I'd never
do such a thing to you.

01:46:53.532 --> 01:46:55.240
That's for sure.

01:46:56.661 --> 01:46:59.116
Playing the old scenes over again.

01:46:59.622 --> 01:47:01.910
I can't stand it.

01:47:04.210 --> 01:47:05.668
Alright, then.

01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:07.795
Have it your way.

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:10.663
I'll leave, you can stay.

01:48:14.072 --> 01:48:15.565
What's up?

01:48:18.784 --> 01:48:21.240
- I'm leaving.
- So soon?

01:48:21.412 --> 01:48:23.618
When you've got to go,
you've got to go.

01:48:23.789 --> 01:48:26.541
There might be black ice.
Could be dangerous.

01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:28.452
I don't mind.

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.544
We love danger.

01:48:31.506 --> 01:48:32.751
Awesome.

01:48:33.799 --> 01:48:36.716
- So where are you heading?
- We'll see.

01:48:37.428 --> 01:48:39.255
Wherever the road takes me.

01:48:40.389 --> 01:48:42.014
Was Hidayet downstairs?

01:48:42.808 --> 01:48:45.928
- Yes, I checked out with him.
- No, that's not what I meant.

01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:49.302
Do you need anything?
Food for the road?

01:48:49.524 --> 01:48:50.851
No, thank you.

01:48:53.110 --> 01:48:54.391
Anyway...

01:48:55.071 --> 01:48:56.233
Fine.

01:48:58.908 --> 01:49:01.944
- Have a safe journey.
- Thank you.

01:49:02.119 --> 01:49:03.199
Don't forget us.

01:49:26.351 --> 01:49:28.677
Nihal, am I disturbing you?

01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:32.689
Don't hide it, I won't look.

01:49:32.858 --> 01:49:34.851
I just wanted to ask something.

01:49:35.027 --> 01:49:36.023
Then ask, Aydin.

01:49:38.947 --> 01:49:41.652
I heard you raised funds last night.

01:49:42.743 --> 01:49:44.071
Is that true?

01:49:44.245 --> 01:49:46.913
Yes, we did. So what?

01:49:47.915 --> 01:49:49.872
Why didn't you tell me?

01:49:50.543 --> 01:49:51.870
Did I have to?

01:49:55.756 --> 01:49:59.125
You didn't have to,
but I'd have appreciated it.

01:49:59.302 --> 01:50:02.386
I might have wanted
to make a significant contribution.

01:50:02.721 --> 01:50:05.212
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:50:06.768 --> 01:50:08.806
We're doing fine on our own.

01:50:08.978 --> 01:50:10.389
We don't need you, thanks.

01:50:10.562 --> 01:50:12.271
Come on.

01:50:13.315 --> 01:50:15.273
One always needs more.

01:50:16.193 --> 01:50:18.352
After all, I'm a wealthy man.

01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:22.237
What's more natural
than helping an educational project?

01:50:23.158 --> 01:50:25.317
But nobody expects
anything from you.

01:50:25.495 --> 01:50:28.531
From you neither, darling.

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:32.620
Yet you created a huge committee
in our house without me knowing.

01:50:32.793 --> 01:50:33.706
Didn't you?

01:50:34.128 --> 01:50:35.955
Listen to me, Aydin, please.

01:50:36.797 --> 01:50:38.754
We've lived in peace
for two years,

01:50:38.924 --> 01:50:41.166
each to his own affairs.

01:50:41.343 --> 01:50:42.967
What's suddenly changed?

01:50:44.638 --> 01:50:48.885
Yesterday your aim was
to humiliate me and the guests.

01:50:49.351 --> 01:50:51.807
- Think I didn't notice?
- Me?

01:50:51.979 --> 01:50:53.474
Never even crossed my mind.

01:50:53.647 --> 01:50:55.142
Come on, for God's sake.

01:50:55.316 --> 01:50:57.888
I was so angry,
I couldn't sleep last night.

01:50:59.278 --> 01:51:03.406
If we start fighting and quarreling
again like we used to,

01:51:03.573 --> 01:51:05.899
then it's clear I can't stay here.

01:51:21.717 --> 01:51:24.837
- Is that a threat?
- Why would I threaten you?

01:51:25.554 --> 01:51:27.345
I'm just saying what could happen.

01:51:30.226 --> 01:51:32.182
OK, say you left.

01:51:32.687 --> 01:51:34.014
Where would you go?

01:51:34.188 --> 01:51:36.643
Wherever I could. I don't know.

01:51:36.815 --> 01:51:37.978
I'd go to Istanbul.

01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:40.937
Find a job and work.

01:51:46.283 --> 01:51:47.991
Nihal, my darling.

01:51:49.912 --> 01:51:53.826
You haven't got tired of banging
the same old drum for years.

01:51:55.126 --> 01:51:57.498
As if I'm keeping you here by force.

01:51:59.964 --> 01:52:02.633
I've never stopped you, have I?

01:52:03.134 --> 01:52:07.001
Go whenever you like.
Maybe you should. Try it.

01:52:07.513 --> 01:52:09.635
Find a job, with the minimum wage.

01:52:10.307 --> 01:52:12.134
From 8 to 6.

01:52:12.935 --> 01:52:16.885
After work, you can go on saving
the world, if you have energy left.

01:52:17.398 --> 01:52:19.022
I'll do it if necessary.

01:52:20.359 --> 01:52:22.600
Much better than wasting my life

01:52:22.778 --> 01:52:25.447
living like a parasite
with an arrogant man like you.

01:52:26.866 --> 01:52:29.617
Thanks to you,
I'm drifting in vain here.

01:52:30.244 --> 01:52:33.447
I'm sponging off you.
I spend your money.

01:52:33.622 --> 01:52:37.786
But I pay for it with my freedom
and my useless loyalty.

01:52:38.419 --> 01:52:42.630
Do you know how donating even a
little of someone else's money feels?

01:52:42.798 --> 01:52:43.793
No, I don't.

01:52:44.717 --> 01:52:45.747
And why?

01:52:45.926 --> 01:52:49.425
Because I've worked like a dog
all my life not to know.

01:52:51.223 --> 01:52:53.892
I couldn't enjoy
my childhood or youth.

01:52:58.272 --> 01:53:01.225
Too much of an easy life,
that's your trouble.

01:53:02.651 --> 01:53:05.189
You have no idea
what gratitude means.

01:53:18.834 --> 01:53:20.874
Besides, I'm asking you...

01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:26.295
Stop these secret meetings
and gatherings at my house.

01:53:27.551 --> 01:53:30.718
I only allow close acquaintances
into my house.

01:53:32.097 --> 01:53:36.510
If that lot want to do charity work,
they should find somewhere else.

01:53:38.145 --> 01:53:42.225
Nobody can come here yelling away
in the middle of the night.

01:53:42.399 --> 01:53:44.060
I won't allow it.

01:53:48.364 --> 01:53:51.364
And that bum of a teacher
doesn't give a damn.

01:53:51.783 --> 01:53:54.357
The school needs this or that.

01:53:55.453 --> 01:54:00.282
His real aim is to trap
bored neurotics like you.

01:54:48.090 --> 01:54:50.248
Why don't you understand me, Nihal?

01:54:53.721 --> 01:54:55.678
Why are you being unfair?

01:54:57.558 --> 01:55:01.555
I swear my only intention
when I showed up

01:55:02.479 --> 01:55:04.685
was to help you, support you.

01:55:04.857 --> 01:55:07.893
Please leave me alone, Aydin.
I'm begging you.

01:55:08.402 --> 01:55:12.067
Let's stay away from each other
for a while. You go or me.

01:55:12.239 --> 01:55:14.362
Or let's break up, I don't know.

01:55:16.118 --> 01:55:18.193
OK, why all the shouting?

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:21.538
I'm going anyway.

01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:24.664
I made this decision some time ago.

01:55:26.294 --> 01:55:28.122
I'm off to Istanbul for a while.

01:55:29.673 --> 01:55:32.343
I have things to do for my book, too.

01:55:33.052 --> 01:55:36.136
But I have doubts
about your donations campaign.

01:55:37.097 --> 01:55:38.722
I find it very important.

01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:40.599
I can't leave before sorting it out.

01:55:41.518 --> 01:55:43.843
So please, let's just sit.

01:55:44.479 --> 01:55:47.231
And talk calmly
like two civilized people, OK?

01:55:47.733 --> 01:55:49.275
Come on, please.

01:56:02.748 --> 01:56:05.915
Nihal, I'm asking you kindly.
Come and sit here.

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:09.618
Come on.

01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:19.508
Nihal, will you come over here?

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:06.305
Nihal, darling...

01:57:09.105 --> 01:57:12.391
It's obvious you started
such an organization

01:57:12.568 --> 01:57:15.141
because of your love of people

01:57:15.821 --> 01:57:18.525
and your conscientiousness.

01:57:18.699 --> 01:57:20.822
I'm not looking for a conspiracy.

01:57:20.992 --> 01:57:23.697
In fact, I will support you
all the way.

01:57:25.581 --> 01:57:29.910
Although I respect your intelligence
and your feelings,

01:57:30.085 --> 01:57:32.043
especially your feelings,

01:57:33.338 --> 01:57:37.586
I can't allow such a tricky business
which could cause us

01:57:37.759 --> 01:57:41.259
big problems we can't predict now

01:57:41.429 --> 01:57:45.593
to be ruined at the hands of you
and those rascals.

01:57:47.269 --> 01:57:49.262
However pure your intentions.

01:57:50.064 --> 01:57:54.441
Remember "The road to hell
is paved with good intentions."

01:57:56.862 --> 01:57:59.269
For a start, you've no experience.

01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:01.650
You know nothing of life.

01:58:01.825 --> 01:58:03.617
You're too impetuous.

01:58:03.786 --> 01:58:05.742
You are easily deceived.

01:58:06.288 --> 01:58:08.530
You trust people instantly.

01:58:09.875 --> 01:58:13.290
You've gathered all these
strange assistants around you.

01:58:14.254 --> 01:58:16.543
This is very dangerous business,
Nihal.

01:58:17.382 --> 01:58:20.502
To tell you the truth,

01:58:21.178 --> 01:58:25.389
under these conditions, any efforts
will lead to two bad outcomes.

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:30.559
First, nothing gets done
for the schools.

01:58:30.729 --> 01:58:35.106
Second, you'll lose a fortune
because of all the shoddy work.

01:58:35.275 --> 01:58:37.018
And your name will be stained.

01:58:37.194 --> 01:58:39.946
One can say the money
doesn't matter. I can cover it.

01:58:40.113 --> 01:58:43.068
But what about your name, our name?

01:58:43.617 --> 01:58:46.025
Once things get out of hand,

01:58:46.202 --> 01:58:49.322
you can't imagine all the gossip.

01:58:49.497 --> 01:58:53.330
They'll all accuse us
of embezzling the donations.

01:58:53.502 --> 01:58:55.541
And you'll suddenly be all alone.

01:58:55.712 --> 01:58:57.207
They'll all vanish.

01:58:57.381 --> 01:58:58.709
And we'll get blamed.

01:58:58.882 --> 01:59:00.922
Just get to the point.

01:59:02.052 --> 01:59:03.463
My point is this.

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:06.093
I was glad
you were collecting donations.

01:59:06.264 --> 01:59:08.590
But to be honest, I was worried too.

01:59:09.225 --> 01:59:12.844
You need more than enthusiasm
in this kind of affair.

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:16.649
So I felt the urge to step in,

01:59:16.816 --> 01:59:20.067
so we don't have problems
in the future.

01:59:20.486 --> 01:59:22.859
- The urge?
- Yes.

01:59:23.865 --> 01:59:28.657
Otherwise, I'd have gone to Istanbul.
But I can't until I sort this out.

01:59:29.204 --> 01:59:32.537
This is a risky business, Nihal.
It's not a game.

01:59:33.333 --> 01:59:36.832
There have been
all these fraud cases recently

01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:39.958
and all the new laws.
Do you know them?

01:59:40.173 --> 01:59:42.462
Get to the point.
What do you want?

01:59:42.967 --> 01:59:46.503
I want to see
all the donations and expenditures.

01:59:47.889 --> 01:59:52.018
And the list of your helpers.

01:59:52.186 --> 01:59:56.515
I am sure they're trustworthy,
but better safe than sorry.

01:59:57.107 --> 01:59:59.099
Are you serious?

01:59:59.276 --> 02:00:03.274
Nihal, let's be reasonable, please.

02:00:03.446 --> 02:00:06.780
Don't you trust my experience,
and my honesty?

02:00:09.119 --> 02:00:11.408
I'm still not sure what you're after.

02:00:11.746 --> 02:00:14.118
What could I be after?

02:00:14.666 --> 02:00:16.789
What could I possibly be after?

02:00:17.961 --> 02:00:21.295
I'm just trying to prevent
any problems for my family.

02:00:21.464 --> 02:00:23.089
I have the right, don't I?

02:00:27.429 --> 02:00:28.460
Now...

02:00:31.641 --> 02:00:34.892
Let me see the donations
and your expenses.

02:00:35.062 --> 02:00:38.182
It'll take me a minute
to spot any problems.

02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:41.645
I just want to see your situation.

02:00:41.818 --> 02:00:44.938
I have nothing to hide.
Anyone can look.

02:00:45.114 --> 02:00:46.857
There they are, take a look.

02:00:51.452 --> 02:00:52.912
These?

02:01:12.224 --> 02:01:15.593
I'm sorry but I don't understand
any of this.

02:01:16.352 --> 02:01:19.140
Don't you have a table
showing donations?

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:21.806
We have the signed documents.

02:01:25.445 --> 02:01:28.232
Nihal, dearest...

02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:31.826
It's obvious you haven't a clue.

02:01:31.993 --> 02:01:34.484
How is that possible?

02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:40.123
How come you don't have a chart
showing everything at once?

02:01:44.506 --> 02:01:48.669
You should also have a copy
of the receipts for donations.

02:01:48.843 --> 02:01:50.041
Do you have them?

02:01:50.637 --> 02:01:51.633
No.

02:01:53.264 --> 02:01:57.428
For money or goods in kind,

02:01:57.602 --> 02:02:01.185
you have to prepare
an invoice or receipt.

02:02:01.356 --> 02:02:03.147
Have they been issued?

02:02:03.316 --> 02:02:04.858
I don't think so.

02:02:05.944 --> 02:02:07.652
But all this is very important.

02:02:08.196 --> 02:02:09.477
Very important.

02:02:10.991 --> 02:02:15.569
What if they want to deduct
the donation from taxes?

02:02:17.748 --> 02:02:20.239
Or if they try to dodge taxes?

02:02:20.416 --> 02:02:23.334
You'd get blamed and end up in jail.

02:02:23.504 --> 02:02:29.043
Sorry but these are
very important details.

02:02:30.093 --> 02:02:34.304
Another thing. Receipts should be
numbered and listed separately.

02:02:34.472 --> 02:02:35.967
Has that been done?

02:02:36.391 --> 02:02:37.720
I don't think so.

02:02:38.852 --> 02:02:42.055
Never mind. I'll start doing that,
to save you worrying.

02:02:43.648 --> 02:02:44.846
Yes, do so.

02:02:45.358 --> 02:02:46.603
Do as you wish.

02:02:49.279 --> 02:02:50.441
Alright.

02:02:51.739 --> 02:02:54.147
Then let's do it like this.

02:02:55.202 --> 02:03:00.540
Let me take this pile of books
and papers to my study.

02:03:00.707 --> 02:03:04.835
I have some software,
I'll run them through.

02:03:05.294 --> 02:03:09.375
I'll let you know my thoughts
once I've had a good look. OK?

02:03:12.678 --> 02:03:14.171
Is this part of it, too?

02:03:17.223 --> 02:03:18.303
Alright.

02:03:20.686 --> 02:03:24.268
Are you sure that's it?
If there's more, let me take it.

02:03:24.981 --> 02:03:25.930
Take them.

02:03:28.235 --> 02:03:30.310
Take them all. Don't leave anything.

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:34.486
That was all I had left in life.
You can have them too.

02:03:35.492 --> 02:03:37.283
Take everything I have.

02:03:38.036 --> 02:03:41.203
Dear Nihal,
why are you talking like that?

02:03:41.372 --> 02:03:42.404
Take them all.

02:03:44.209 --> 02:03:46.581
Take them, they can all be yours.

02:03:47.044 --> 02:03:48.670
Take these too.

02:03:51.633 --> 02:03:52.415
Here.

02:03:52.592 --> 02:03:54.881
- Take them.
- What are you doing?

02:04:18.242 --> 02:04:20.948
Oh, my dear Nihal.

02:04:23.331 --> 02:04:26.036
You're acting like a child.

02:04:26.543 --> 02:04:28.084
What can I say?

02:04:29.003 --> 02:04:31.838
When you understand
how important this is,

02:04:32.006 --> 02:04:34.249
you'll come and thank me.

02:04:35.844 --> 02:04:37.386
Wait and see.

02:05:29.481 --> 02:05:31.307
Nihal, listen.

02:05:32.275 --> 02:05:34.980
Here are all your documents back.

02:05:35.821 --> 02:05:37.896
I didn't look at them much.

02:05:38.823 --> 02:05:40.946
Because I've changed my mind.

02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:45.196
I'm not going to get involved,
stick my nose in.

02:05:48.250 --> 02:05:51.167
To tell the truth,
I felt a little bit lazy.

02:05:51.378 --> 02:05:55.327
I have enough work already.
So, you do whatever suits you.

02:05:58.844 --> 02:06:02.888
In the meantime, I'm leaving
tomorrow. I've decided to go.

02:06:03.932 --> 02:06:06.054
At least till the end of winter.

02:06:06.559 --> 02:06:10.094
The hotel's never too busy in winter.
Hidayet is here.

02:06:11.231 --> 02:06:13.140
Tomorrow I'm going to Istanbul.

02:06:20.865 --> 02:06:22.574
Nihal, cut it out, for God's sake!

02:06:23.576 --> 02:06:25.782
I said I'm leaving,
what more do you want?

02:06:28.414 --> 02:06:31.166
Your altruism
brings tears to my eyes.

02:06:56.317 --> 02:06:57.860
Do you remember?

02:06:59.696 --> 02:07:01.569
You once told me

02:07:02.031 --> 02:07:05.567
that if I could change
some of my behavior,

02:07:07.078 --> 02:07:09.237
you would forgive me completely.

02:07:09.372 --> 02:07:10.652
Remember?

02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:14.251
Which means...

02:07:16.171 --> 02:07:18.163
for you I'm guilty of something.

02:07:22.427 --> 02:07:24.051
Therefore,

02:07:25.763 --> 02:07:29.678
calmly and briefly,

02:07:30.435 --> 02:07:33.222
in terms I can understand,

02:07:33.354 --> 02:07:35.394
I ask you to tell me

02:07:35.564 --> 02:07:37.225
what I'm guilty of.

02:07:46.493 --> 02:07:49.066
I'm too tired, I can't talk now.

02:07:49.621 --> 02:07:51.080
Later maybe.

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:56.373
What kind of guilt is that?

02:07:58.629 --> 02:08:00.124
What have I done to you?

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:05.925
Is that you're young, beautiful
and would like to live your life?

02:08:06.429 --> 02:08:10.130
I'm much older than you
and you hate me for that?

02:08:11.184 --> 02:08:12.262
Is that my guilt?

02:08:15.063 --> 02:08:17.518
I didn't force you to marry me.

02:08:19.775 --> 02:08:21.982
I never restricted your freedom.

02:08:23.196 --> 02:08:27.110
You live as you wish, independently,
in your part of the house.

02:08:28.576 --> 02:08:32.028
You have even set up
a huge committee here.

02:08:34.624 --> 02:08:37.293
If you want even more freedom,
it's yours.

02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:39.120
No one's stopping you.

02:08:39.837 --> 02:08:40.916
I mean it.

02:08:42.507 --> 02:08:45.674
If you want a divorce,
I won't stop you either.

02:08:59.315 --> 02:09:01.225
I don't want anything like that.

02:09:03.194 --> 02:09:05.650
Of course, I wanted to marry you.

02:09:08.116 --> 02:09:10.986
It's not that I'm young,
and you're old,

02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:14.280
or I could love someone else
if I was free.

02:09:16.875 --> 02:09:20.243
I always felt
I'm older than you anyway.

02:09:23.631 --> 02:09:25.956
But you're an unbearable man.

02:09:27.134 --> 02:09:30.219
You are selfish, spiteful, cynical.

02:09:31.806 --> 02:09:33.264
That's what you're guilty of.

02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:40.853
Possible.
Maybe I'm like that, I don't know.

02:09:42.024 --> 02:09:46.568
At least I can admit my mistakes
from time to time.

02:09:47.989 --> 02:09:51.572
But I've never once seen you
take the blame for anything.

02:09:51.743 --> 02:09:52.656
Am I wrong?

02:09:52.827 --> 02:09:55.697
If you intend to nag all night,
I should let you know,

02:09:55.872 --> 02:09:58.789
I don't have the strength
to answer back anymore.

02:09:58.958 --> 02:10:01.165
I don't want to nag at all.

02:10:01.877 --> 02:10:04.001
But I have to ask again.

02:10:04.172 --> 02:10:06.413
I need to know.

02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:09.341
What am I guilty of?

02:10:11.638 --> 02:10:13.511
What kind of guilt is it?

02:10:14.266 --> 02:10:16.009
What have I done to you?

02:10:18.394 --> 02:10:19.592
True.

02:10:22.273 --> 02:10:24.681
You're actually a well-educated,

02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:26.522
honest,

02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:29.525
fair and conscientious man.

02:10:30.448 --> 02:10:34.315
Generally you are like that.
I won't deny it.

02:10:36.370 --> 02:10:39.621
But you sometimes use these virtues
to suffocate people,

02:10:39.833 --> 02:10:42.834
to crush and humiliate them.

02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.539
Your high principles make you
hate the whole world.

02:10:50.051 --> 02:10:52.044
You hate believers,

02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:56.680
because for you, believing is a sign
of underdevelopment and ignorance.

02:10:57.558 --> 02:11:02.434
But you also hate non-believers
for their lack of faith or ideals.

02:11:04.482 --> 02:11:06.356
You dislike the old

02:11:06.859 --> 02:11:10.394
for being conservative bigots
and not thinking freely.

02:11:11.447 --> 02:11:14.199
And you dislike the young
for thinking freely

02:11:14.992 --> 02:11:17.530
and abandoning the traditions.

02:11:19.121 --> 02:11:22.905
You defend the virtues of community.

02:11:24.544 --> 02:11:29.371
But you suspect everyone
of being a thief or a bandit,

02:11:29.632 --> 02:11:31.459
so you hate the people, too.

02:11:33.094 --> 02:11:35.134
You hate practically everybody.

02:11:37.223 --> 02:11:38.634
Just once,

02:11:39.725 --> 02:11:43.557
I'd like you to defend something
that might cost you

02:11:43.730 --> 02:11:48.190
and have feelings
that don't benefit yourself.

02:11:51.612 --> 02:11:53.155
But that's not possible.

02:12:02.748 --> 02:12:06.164
In the past, you stopped us
splitting up, using various methods.

02:12:09.464 --> 02:12:11.752
Well, maybe it worked both ways.

02:12:13.218 --> 02:12:15.127
I was too young to leave.

02:12:17.054 --> 02:12:19.427
I didn't have the courage
or the money.

02:12:20.349 --> 02:12:22.638
Or anywhere better to go.

02:12:25.563 --> 02:12:28.564
But didn't you feel any remorse

02:12:28.733 --> 02:12:32.184
seeing a young, healthy,
proud, lively woman

02:12:32.737 --> 02:12:34.563
wither away

02:12:34.989 --> 02:12:39.449
in emptiness, boredom and fear?

02:12:41.996 --> 02:12:44.155
I felt fear in our first years.

02:12:45.458 --> 02:12:47.616
Now I feel ashamed.

02:12:52.131 --> 02:12:54.419
My best years have been wasted.

02:12:55.217 --> 02:12:58.882
I shed all my good qualities
to struggle with you.

02:13:01.015 --> 02:13:05.012
I've become tough,
coarse, timid and suspicious.

02:13:09.565 --> 02:13:11.522
What else can I say?

02:13:14.403 --> 02:13:17.689
I'm not even sure
I could express anything.

02:13:23.871 --> 02:13:26.788
But our paths have now parted
even if it's under one roof.

02:13:28.042 --> 02:13:29.951
We should each go our own way.

02:13:38.970 --> 02:13:42.137
We could've had a better life.

02:13:45.059 --> 02:13:46.850
But it's too late now.

02:13:51.190 --> 02:13:53.230
You wouldn't know, but...

02:13:53.401 --> 02:13:57.862
people like me who grew up in
villages with not even electricity,

02:13:59.574 --> 02:14:02.408
understand the joy and pleasure

02:14:02.952 --> 02:14:06.285
of being in a small,
warm, cosy room like this,

02:14:06.664 --> 02:14:08.206
listening to my wife's voice,

02:14:08.374 --> 02:14:12.917
even if she is screaming
in my face how bad I am.

02:14:18.467 --> 02:14:20.840
Our youth was very dull, Nihal.

02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:25.171
We didn't know how to be happy.

02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:28.638
So we may not know
how to make others happy.

02:14:31.439 --> 02:14:33.063
But as I said,

02:14:33.566 --> 02:14:35.558
we had no bad intentions.

02:14:37.194 --> 02:14:41.488
We set out with good intentions,
pure, innocent dreams.

02:14:43.492 --> 02:14:45.532
We wanted a better life and society.

02:14:45.703 --> 02:14:47.661
Sorry, but I don't believe you.

02:14:48.248 --> 02:14:50.868
I've heard it all before.
You're not on stage anymore.

02:14:52.334 --> 02:14:54.659
We all start with good intentions.

02:14:55.088 --> 02:14:59.714
But as you said, the road to hell
is paved with good intentions.

02:15:00.051 --> 02:15:02.339
So all this means nothing.

02:15:02.512 --> 02:15:05.429
All these fine words
sound ridiculous to me now.

02:15:06.808 --> 02:15:09.215
When you start talking like this,

02:15:09.394 --> 02:15:14.435
I feel like you're pulling
trick number two to get your way.

02:15:16.192 --> 02:15:20.106
Yet I've never understood
what you really want from me.

02:15:20.863 --> 02:15:22.523
Even so,

02:15:23.074 --> 02:15:25.149
I'll ask you one more time.

02:15:26.744 --> 02:15:28.784
Whatever you call my activity,

02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:32.205
self-deception or feminine logic,

02:15:33.126 --> 02:15:35.000
leave me alone.

02:15:36.087 --> 02:15:39.041
Because this is my only consolation.

02:15:43.886 --> 02:15:46.459
I spent my entire youth
fighting with you.

02:15:47.265 --> 02:15:51.890
Now, thanks to this work,
I believe in myself again.

02:15:52.937 --> 02:15:56.222
I have found a meaning
to my dull life here.

02:15:56.733 --> 02:15:59.519
A purpose that makes me feel proud.

02:16:01.445 --> 02:16:03.569
So, at least allow me that.

02:16:06.576 --> 02:16:08.069
Nihal, darling.

02:16:09.453 --> 02:16:11.909
You're a good-hearted,

02:16:12.081 --> 02:16:15.331
smart, rational, sensible woman.

02:16:16.627 --> 02:16:19.831
Everything you say and do
is very reasonable.

02:16:20.005 --> 02:16:21.583
It really is.

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:24.707
But...

02:16:25.803 --> 02:16:29.137
not seeing a man for what he is,
idolizing him like a god,

02:16:29.599 --> 02:16:32.304
and then being mad at him,

02:16:32.433 --> 02:16:34.842
because he's not a god.

02:16:36.606 --> 02:16:38.349
Do you think that's fair?

02:16:46.073 --> 02:16:51.316
I wish I were the successful,
charismatic actor you dreamed of.

02:16:52.413 --> 02:16:53.906
But I am not.

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.200
I'm a simple man.

02:16:59.503 --> 02:17:02.457
And what's worse,
I'd like to stay that way.

02:17:06.343 --> 02:17:08.003
Anyway...

02:17:08.179 --> 02:17:10.088
I'm leaving in the morning.

02:17:10.764 --> 02:17:13.433
Don't worry, I won't be back
before spring.

02:17:15.394 --> 02:17:16.852
But give me that list,

02:17:18.522 --> 02:17:21.393
so I can make a small donation.

02:17:22.026 --> 02:17:25.311
Do as you please. I don't care.

02:17:26.112 --> 02:17:28.817
The list is there,
write what you want.

02:18:06.862 --> 02:18:09.067
I signed it an anonymous donor.

02:18:13.994 --> 02:18:15.736
And left the money here.

02:18:16.706 --> 02:18:17.904
Alright?

02:18:23.462 --> 02:18:25.952
I hope things turn out
as you'd like.

02:18:27.967 --> 02:18:30.007
Do as you want.

02:18:31.721 --> 02:18:34.971
And don't forget I'm there
if you need any help.

02:18:38.602 --> 02:18:41.473
But beware of that teacher.

02:18:42.189 --> 02:18:45.440
He looked like the sneaky,
scheming type to me.

02:18:45.609 --> 02:18:47.982
I can smell his kind a mile away.

02:18:49.362 --> 02:18:52.150
I suggest you work with people

02:18:52.366 --> 02:18:56.031
who are conscientious, principled
and have moral sense.

02:18:57.370 --> 02:18:59.861
One day, you'll understand better.

02:19:03.544 --> 02:19:05.252
Conscience. Morals.

02:19:06.213 --> 02:19:08.420
Ideals, principles.

02:19:08.591 --> 02:19:10.547
The purpose of life.

02:19:11.093 --> 02:19:13.584
You're always saying these words.

02:19:15.222 --> 02:19:18.508
The words you always use
to humiliate, hurt,

02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:20.925
or denigrate someone.

02:19:22.897 --> 02:19:24.355
But if you ask me...

02:19:24.732 --> 02:19:28.397
if someone uses these words
this much,

02:19:29.486 --> 02:19:31.146
he's the one to suspect.

02:19:50.216 --> 02:19:51.923
Anyway, I'm tired.

02:19:53.219 --> 02:19:55.840
I'd like to sleep,
if you don't mind.

02:20:12.446 --> 02:20:13.726
Necla?

02:22:01.763 --> 02:22:02.843
Go on.

02:23:13.585 --> 02:23:16.290
Should we check again
before we set off?

02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:18.752
I called already.

02:23:18.924 --> 02:23:21.593
No flights,
but the trains are running.

02:23:22.302 --> 02:23:23.500
Are you sure?

02:23:23.679 --> 02:23:25.636
I just called them.

02:23:25.806 --> 02:23:27.882
The train is running.

02:23:28.058 --> 02:23:29.682
Don't worry.

02:23:31.728 --> 02:23:33.009
Fine.

02:23:34.106 --> 02:23:35.766
Let's get going then.

02:24:37.878 --> 02:24:39.372
Hello.

02:24:41.715 --> 02:24:45.629
The Istanbul train is running,
isn't it?

02:24:45.844 --> 02:24:47.801
No problem. It's on its way.

02:24:47.972 --> 02:24:49.299
Any delay?

02:24:49.473 --> 02:24:51.631
Of course, half an hour or an hour.

02:24:51.808 --> 02:24:54.346
- Half an hour, an hour.
- That's it.

02:24:54.519 --> 02:24:57.604
- But it's definitely coming, right?
- Probably.

02:24:57.773 --> 02:24:59.682
OK, thank you.

02:25:14.414 --> 02:25:18.163
- It's coming, but there's a delay...
- I heard him.

02:25:21.338 --> 02:25:23.081
Your luggage is there.

02:25:25.175 --> 02:25:27.749
I'll go back to the hotel
if you like.

02:25:28.136 --> 02:25:30.343
They might need me there now.

02:25:31.139 --> 02:25:33.179
- Should I go or stay?
- What?

02:25:33.350 --> 02:25:35.924
They might need me at the hotel.

02:25:36.102 --> 02:25:38.261
Should I go or wait here?

02:25:39.565 --> 02:25:40.893
Wait.

02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:04.208
My friend, could you move over a bit?

02:26:06.049 --> 02:26:07.425
It's cold by the door.

02:26:07.593 --> 02:26:10.677
We're together.
You know, if you shift a bit.

02:26:10.846 --> 02:26:12.885
There's a draft, I said. Sit here.

02:27:27.965 --> 02:27:30.123
How's the road to Suavi's?

02:27:30.675 --> 02:27:32.549
- Mr Suavi's farm?
- Yes.

02:27:32.719 --> 02:27:34.712
It's a long way.

02:27:34.889 --> 02:27:36.263
That's not my question.

02:27:36.431 --> 02:27:37.974
Can the car make it?

02:27:38.141 --> 02:27:40.264
No, it wouldn't.

02:27:40.436 --> 02:27:43.638
The village road's impossible
in this snow.

02:27:44.314 --> 02:27:46.603
Good, then we're going there.

02:28:05.836 --> 02:28:08.208
Hey, what a surprise!

02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:11.630
We were passing
and decided to return your visit.

02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:14.671
Of course. Come in.
It's warm inside.

02:28:16.679 --> 02:28:18.222
Come in.

02:28:18.348 --> 02:28:20.008
- Thanks.
- This way.

02:28:20.183 --> 02:28:22.425
- Sit down, get warmed up.
- Thanks.

02:28:22.602 --> 02:28:24.429
I was expecting Levent.

02:28:24.605 --> 02:28:26.396
So I thought it was him.

02:28:26.565 --> 02:28:29.685
But with Levent, you never know

02:28:29.818 --> 02:28:31.360
whether he'll come.

02:28:32.487 --> 02:28:35.025
We meet every Saturday afternoon.

02:28:35.199 --> 02:28:36.990
To go hunting
the morning after.

02:28:38.410 --> 02:28:42.822
You know. Two bachelors. We lean
on each other like walking sticks.

02:28:43.916 --> 02:28:46.407
Suavi, can I stretch my leg out?

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:48.493
- Go ahead.
- I got cramp.

02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:50.793
Put it up higher. That's it.

02:28:51.882 --> 02:28:53.257
How nice.

02:28:54.134 --> 02:28:55.794
Nice and warm.

02:28:55.969 --> 02:28:57.463
Comfy couches.

02:28:57.638 --> 02:28:59.297
You must be cold.

02:28:59.639 --> 02:29:01.679
Wait, I've got just the thing.

02:29:01.850 --> 02:29:05.432
One sip of this,
and the cold will disappear.

02:29:06.062 --> 02:29:08.387
Let's see if you like it.

02:29:10.275 --> 02:29:12.944
We take this with us
when we go hunting.

02:29:13.111 --> 02:29:15.069
We put some in our flasks.

02:29:16.907 --> 02:29:19.658
It's freezing cold out there.

02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:21.868
The teacher is young.

02:29:22.412 --> 02:29:23.741
Sturdy as an ox.

02:29:23.913 --> 02:29:26.583
But I need this in my engine
to keep up.

02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:29.704
I better not. I'm not used to it.

02:29:29.878 --> 02:29:31.538
If you've some herb tea...

02:29:31.713 --> 02:29:35.793
You can drink that at home.
Here, you do what I tell you.

02:29:35.967 --> 02:29:38.458
Well, fine then. Thanks.

02:29:39.679 --> 02:29:43.297
This is how I spoil myself.
What else is there?

02:29:43.475 --> 02:29:46.144
We deserve it at our age.

02:29:47.354 --> 02:29:49.062
I feel warmer now.

02:29:51.608 --> 02:29:52.603
Thank you.

02:29:52.776 --> 02:29:54.519
The stove is burning nicely.

02:29:55.612 --> 02:29:57.901
I don't heat the whole house now.

02:29:58.073 --> 02:30:00.694
After my wife died
I closed off the rooms.

02:30:00.867 --> 02:30:02.326
I use them as storage.

02:30:02.494 --> 02:30:04.286
And I set up this stove here.

02:30:04.454 --> 02:30:07.289
It's like a shelter.
I curl up here.

02:30:07.458 --> 02:30:09.366
And it helps me save a bit.

02:30:11.044 --> 02:30:13.879
By the way,
what did you do about the letter?

02:30:14.047 --> 02:30:15.245
What letter?

02:30:15.424 --> 02:30:18.092
The one you read to Nihal and me.

02:30:18.259 --> 02:30:20.965
Garip, the girl, help, and all that.

02:30:22.138 --> 02:30:23.798
I didn't do anything.

02:30:26.601 --> 02:30:28.559
Teacher! You made it.

02:30:29.646 --> 02:30:31.520
Indeed.
Mr Aydin, nice to see you.

02:30:31.690 --> 02:30:33.019
Thank you, Levent.

02:30:33.191 --> 02:30:35.729
- Don't get up.
- My foot's gone numb.

02:30:35.902 --> 02:30:38.987
If it's only numbness,
you'll be fine.

02:30:39.114 --> 02:30:39.861
Hello.

02:30:40.031 --> 02:30:41.526
We had business nearby,

02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:42.945
so we popped in.

02:30:43.117 --> 02:30:43.983
Good idea!

02:30:44.161 --> 02:30:45.571
How bad are the roads?

02:30:45.745 --> 02:30:48.615
Terrible. I had a hard time
getting here.

02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:51.245
Mr Aydin, I'll be outside
if you need me.

02:30:51.418 --> 02:30:52.497
Alright.

02:30:53.962 --> 02:30:56.038
- Hidayet.
- Yes, Mr Aydin.

02:30:56.214 --> 02:30:57.376
Listen.

02:30:58.842 --> 02:30:59.873
Sorry.

02:31:03.221 --> 02:31:04.336
Listen.

02:31:04.806 --> 02:31:08.091
Don't tell anyone at home I'm here.

02:31:08.268 --> 02:31:10.225
Of course I won't.

02:31:10.896 --> 02:31:12.723
So what should I tell them?

02:31:12.897 --> 02:31:14.273
Nothing.

02:31:14.441 --> 02:31:17.358
No, I mean if they call.

02:31:18.528 --> 02:31:23.024
Make something up.
Nobody should know I didn't leave.

02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:25.441
- Alright.
- Be careful.

02:31:29.581 --> 02:31:33.578
At your house, I thought,
"Finally someone worth talking to".

02:31:33.752 --> 02:31:35.411
But then you disappeared.

02:31:35.587 --> 02:31:38.956
Thank you. Something came up.

02:31:39.966 --> 02:31:41.211
I couldn't stay.

02:31:41.385 --> 02:31:42.962
Today's my lucky day.

02:31:43.303 --> 02:31:45.094
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

02:31:45.263 --> 02:31:47.754
Drink up,
it makes you think clearly.

02:31:57.651 --> 02:32:00.402
Hi. What are you up to?

02:32:04.615 --> 02:32:06.110
Now listen.

02:32:07.369 --> 02:32:10.453
Don't say anything
to Mrs Nihal or anyone.

02:32:10.622 --> 02:32:14.571
You know Suavi. We're at his farm.

02:32:17.546 --> 02:32:18.826
He didn't go.

02:32:19.965 --> 02:32:21.542
He changed his mind.

02:32:23.677 --> 02:32:26.511
How should I know?
How can I ask him?

02:32:28.765 --> 02:32:31.850
Stop talking nonsense.
Why would I lie to you?

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:33.972
What did you say?

02:32:34.729 --> 02:32:36.437
Fatma, don't start again.

02:32:36.606 --> 02:32:39.809
It's freezing. What on earth
could I be doing? Are you mad?

02:32:39.985 --> 02:32:41.527
For God's sake.

02:32:41.695 --> 02:32:42.893
When I was a kid,

02:32:43.697 --> 02:32:46.532
I used to play in the garden here.

02:32:47.617 --> 02:32:52.694
It felt life would go on like that
forever, with my mom and dad.

02:32:54.082 --> 02:32:55.625
Where is all that now?

02:32:56.959 --> 02:33:02.085
Sometimes I wonder what happened.
When did the house become so empty?

02:33:03.174 --> 02:33:07.801
When did that mother's
little boy end up

02:33:08.221 --> 02:33:11.921
a drunk, Ionely old man?

02:33:13.935 --> 02:33:15.513
I got married.

02:33:15.687 --> 02:33:17.146
Had a child.

02:33:18.607 --> 02:33:19.934
Where are they?

02:33:21.317 --> 02:33:24.484
Wife in the grave,
daughter miles away...

02:33:26.948 --> 02:33:28.691
What I'm saying is,

02:33:29.243 --> 02:33:32.741
since there are certain things
you can't change,

02:33:33.746 --> 02:33:36.782
you have to be a bit flexible.

02:33:37.542 --> 02:33:39.369
Don't judge people so much.

02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:42.793
Accept things as they are.

02:33:46.635 --> 02:33:48.378
Is it a bit hot in here?

02:33:49.345 --> 02:33:51.422
Should we open a window?

02:33:52.390 --> 02:33:54.264
Of course, go ahead.

02:33:57.145 --> 02:33:59.184
Should we move to that side too?

02:33:59.314 --> 02:34:00.476
Alright.

02:34:00.648 --> 02:34:03.649
- You go, I'll get something.
- OK.

02:34:12.828 --> 02:34:15.200
It's hot and I had a drink.

02:34:15.371 --> 02:34:16.996
I'm feeling a bit drowsy.

02:34:17.331 --> 02:34:19.455
It would've been better not to.

02:34:20.043 --> 02:34:21.502
But it's too late now.

02:34:36.184 --> 02:34:38.509
So, Levent, how old are you?

02:34:39.563 --> 02:34:40.642
35.

02:34:40.814 --> 02:34:43.269
- Really? You don't look it.
- Well, I am.

02:34:44.568 --> 02:34:45.813
Family?

02:34:46.611 --> 02:34:48.983
Back in my hometown, in Yozgat.

02:34:49.573 --> 02:34:51.232
My older sister and mother.

02:34:52.075 --> 02:34:54.114
Ever thought of getting married?

02:34:54.285 --> 02:34:55.281
Well...

02:34:55.453 --> 02:34:57.861
It's fate. Didn't happen.

02:34:58.039 --> 02:34:59.913
I haven't met the right one.

02:35:00.709 --> 02:35:05.003
And I don't have enough money.
So I'm in no rush.

02:35:05.212 --> 02:35:07.086
But in a place like this,

02:35:07.591 --> 02:35:09.250
your salary would do.

02:35:09.426 --> 02:35:11.465
It would, Mr Aydin.

02:35:11.845 --> 02:35:15.012
But I send half to my mother.

02:35:15.181 --> 02:35:17.388
She's saving up for my sister.

02:35:17.517 --> 02:35:20.518
Let her get married.
She's first in line.

02:35:20.645 --> 02:35:22.803
Then me. I'm in no rush.

02:35:24.232 --> 02:35:26.189
How long have you been here?

02:35:27.193 --> 02:35:29.518
This is my fourth year.

02:35:30.614 --> 02:35:31.693
Planning to stay?

02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:37.404
I could leave
but you get used to a place.

02:35:38.371 --> 02:35:41.705
And there are the things
we do with Mrs Nihal.

02:35:41.875 --> 02:35:43.583
I want to finish them.

02:35:43.752 --> 02:35:45.827
That's no problem.

02:35:47.464 --> 02:35:51.046
There are always people
for that kind of thing.

02:35:52.844 --> 02:35:54.920
You're right. There are.

02:35:57.349 --> 02:36:00.468
I had a stammer when I was a child.

02:36:00.852 --> 02:36:02.346
- Really?
- Yes.

02:36:03.313 --> 02:36:06.018
I spent my entire childhood
in silence.

02:36:06.399 --> 02:36:09.649
If I talk too much now, that's why.

02:36:12.572 --> 02:36:14.779
So, sorry if I talk too much.

02:36:15.199 --> 02:36:16.230
Warn me if I do.

02:36:16.409 --> 02:36:18.900
Speak as much as you like.

02:36:19.037 --> 02:36:21.444
You deserve it, my friend.

02:36:22.415 --> 02:36:25.748
I prefer listening anyway.

02:36:26.294 --> 02:36:27.788
Well, I warned you.

02:36:28.379 --> 02:36:29.624
Roast chestnuts.

02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:32.297
A sin not to eat one.

02:36:32.466 --> 02:36:34.424
The chestnut-man is here,
gentlemen.

02:36:35.387 --> 02:36:37.794
He's brought us split chestnuts.

02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:54.835
Yes?

02:37:56.134 --> 02:37:57.414
Hello.

02:37:57.594 --> 02:37:59.586
Sorry to disturb you.

02:37:59.762 --> 02:38:01.839
I'm here to see Hamdi hodja.

02:38:02.015 --> 02:38:03.425
Is he in?

02:38:04.476 --> 02:38:05.555
Just a minute.

02:38:18.782 --> 02:38:19.980
Mrs Nihal?

02:38:21.492 --> 02:38:23.615
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

02:38:23.995 --> 02:38:27.280
I'm sorry. I was inside,
I couldn't... you know...

02:38:27.457 --> 02:38:28.619
How can I help you?

02:38:28.792 --> 02:38:32.457
I should apologize
for disturbing you so late.

02:38:32.628 --> 02:38:35.630
No, not at all. Please.

02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:38.709
Is this a convenient time?

02:38:38.884 --> 02:38:40.794
Sure, of course. Come in.

02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:42.299
Please, come in.

02:38:42.472 --> 02:38:44.511
Don't stand in the cold.

02:38:44.682 --> 02:38:45.845
Thank you.

02:38:47.268 --> 02:38:49.178
Come and sit by the stove.

02:38:49.353 --> 02:38:50.931
Don't worry, I'm fine here.

02:38:51.106 --> 02:38:53.679
It's cold there.
Come in with your shoes.

02:38:53.858 --> 02:38:56.479
Thanks, I won't stay long.
I'll sit here.

02:38:57.528 --> 02:38:59.071
Well then...

02:39:12.210 --> 02:39:14.368
How are you? Hope nothing's wrong.

02:39:14.838 --> 02:39:18.704
Don't get me wrong.
To see you here, alone...

02:39:18.883 --> 02:39:23.177
I was wondering how Ilyas was.
He worried us a lot the other day.

02:39:23.346 --> 02:39:26.347
Actually we heard, but I still wanted
to come for a visit.

02:39:26.891 --> 02:39:29.298
Ilyas is much better now.

02:39:29.477 --> 02:39:32.929
Thank God, he's fine now.
His fever dropped, too.

02:39:33.105 --> 02:39:37.317
That worried us but since yesterday,
he's opened his eyes.

02:39:38.027 --> 02:39:42.072
The only thing, he couldn't go
to school and he gets bored at home.

02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:43.948
Otherwise, he's fine.

02:39:44.325 --> 02:39:45.819
It's not easy.

02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:50.362
I was worried when I heard
it was pneumonia.

02:39:50.915 --> 02:39:52.954
But his mother has taken
good care of him.

02:39:53.125 --> 02:39:58.084
And he took his medicine
and got better. Good boy.

02:39:58.714 --> 02:40:00.257
You're right.

02:40:00.966 --> 02:40:02.082
Thank you.

02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:06.590
Mr Aydin isn't with you?

02:40:08.391 --> 02:40:09.672
No, I came alone.

02:40:10.852 --> 02:40:13.308
Really? Welcome, again.

02:40:15.356 --> 02:40:17.811
You must be cold,
it's freezing outside.

02:40:18.025 --> 02:40:20.184
Let's have some tea. Sevda!

02:40:20.653 --> 02:40:22.610
I'll go to the kitchen.

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:25.615
- Don't bother.
- No, my pleasure.

02:40:41.424 --> 02:40:42.622
Are you studying?

02:40:46.763 --> 02:40:47.877
Huh?

02:40:48.973 --> 02:40:49.969
Yes.

02:40:53.644 --> 02:40:56.314
- Which subject?
- Math.

02:40:57.565 --> 02:40:58.763
Do you like math?

02:40:59.066 --> 02:40:59.980
Yes.

02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:02.393
What will you become then?
An engineer?

02:41:03.196 --> 02:41:04.358
No.

02:41:05.865 --> 02:41:07.490
What then?

02:41:07.658 --> 02:41:08.738
A policeman.

02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:10.941
Why's that?

02:41:22.882 --> 02:41:24.257
Good evening, madam.

02:41:24.425 --> 02:41:26.714
Good evening. And who are you?

02:41:28.387 --> 02:41:31.507
Mother, Mrs Nihal
is our landlord's wife.

02:41:33.934 --> 02:41:35.560
Did she bring the TV back?

02:41:35.728 --> 02:41:38.729
No, mother.
That's a different matter.

02:41:39.232 --> 02:41:40.263
Come, mother.

02:41:41.025 --> 02:41:43.481
I want my TV back.
I watched the Imam.

02:41:43.653 --> 02:41:46.191
Mrs Nihal is here for something else.

02:41:46.363 --> 02:41:48.237
To wish Ilyas a speedy recovery.

02:41:48.407 --> 02:41:49.570
- Sore knees?
- Aching.

02:41:50.284 --> 02:41:52.692
- Let's cover them.
- No, I don't want to.

02:41:52.912 --> 02:41:53.693
Alright.

02:41:53.871 --> 02:41:56.493
You don't take me to the doctor.

02:41:57.041 --> 02:42:00.410
Mother, you're disgracing us
in front of Mrs Nihal.

02:42:00.586 --> 02:42:02.959
- You refused to go, remember?
- Too crowded.

02:42:03.130 --> 02:42:06.464
They can't look after me there.
I need a private doctor.

02:42:06.634 --> 02:42:08.009
But please...

02:42:08.761 --> 02:42:11.216
I said to go to a private doctor too.

02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:13.548
You refused to go to our Samet.

02:42:13.724 --> 02:42:16.097
You remember
what his mother did to me?

02:42:16.603 --> 02:42:19.271
But the son isn't the mother.

02:42:19.438 --> 02:42:20.719
The doctor has to come.

02:42:20.857 --> 02:42:23.430
OK then,
I'll bring the doctor right here.

02:42:23.609 --> 02:42:25.816
He'll take care of my mother here.

02:42:25.987 --> 02:42:28.145
Sevda, give me my prayer beads.

02:42:28.322 --> 02:42:29.437
I apologize.

02:42:30.116 --> 02:42:31.064
No problem.

02:42:31.242 --> 02:42:34.278
When young, we're tested for our
respect and later, our compassion.

02:42:34.828 --> 02:42:37.237
God bless our elders.

02:42:37.414 --> 02:42:39.988
"If youngsters could know,
if elders could do."

02:42:40.168 --> 02:42:43.453
I don't want to keep you longer.

02:42:44.505 --> 02:42:46.248
I need to talk to you.

02:42:47.424 --> 02:42:48.705
Of course, please.

02:42:50.845 --> 02:42:55.139
If you don't mind,
could we speak in private?

02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:59.014
Of course, why not?

02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:03.600
We could go in there,
but it might be a bit cold.

02:43:03.816 --> 02:43:06.022
Fine, it doesn't matter.

02:43:06.193 --> 02:43:07.772
Let's go in. Sevda!

02:43:07.945 --> 02:43:09.654
Put some wood on the stove.

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:12.108
I'll bring your tea through.

02:43:13.284 --> 02:43:14.908
- Thank you.
- Please.

02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:21.498
How many rooms are there?

02:43:22.334 --> 02:43:24.208
There used to be two.

02:43:24.378 --> 02:43:27.130
Then we added this one.

02:43:27.507 --> 02:43:31.504
We got permission
from Mr Aydin's father, Mr Sami.

02:43:32.345 --> 02:43:34.088
So now, we have three rooms.

02:43:34.263 --> 02:43:36.220
This is my room.

02:43:36.599 --> 02:43:39.054
It gets a bit colder
than the other rooms.

02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:43.474
But we built a fireplace
for when it gets very cold.

02:43:44.106 --> 02:43:46.099
Fortunately, not this year.

02:43:46.275 --> 02:43:47.556
That's right.

02:43:48.862 --> 02:43:52.527
Mr Hamdi, I'd like to ask you
something, please.

02:43:52.698 --> 02:43:53.978
Please do.

02:43:56.035 --> 02:43:57.944
Mr Ismail, your younger brother...

02:43:58.121 --> 02:44:00.907
- Older brother.
- Sorry.

02:44:01.373 --> 02:44:04.078
What exactly does he do?

02:44:06.129 --> 02:44:10.292
He hasn't worked for some time.
He used to work at the mine in Tozlu.

02:44:10.466 --> 02:44:13.217
But unfortunately,
he got into some trouble.

02:44:13.678 --> 02:44:16.216
He was in prison for six months.

02:44:16.388 --> 02:44:17.799
And hasn't worked since.

02:44:18.265 --> 02:44:21.765
If you don't mind me asking,

02:44:21.935 --> 02:44:23.680
why was he jailed?

02:44:23.854 --> 02:44:25.052
What did he do?

02:44:25.231 --> 02:44:28.231
God knows, this is very embarrassing.

02:44:28.526 --> 02:44:31.147
I'd rather you didn't
know us like this.

02:44:32.196 --> 02:44:35.814
But I won't hide something
known to God.

02:44:36.534 --> 02:44:38.610
Everyone probably knows anyway.

02:44:40.329 --> 02:44:43.246
A few louts in town
were pestering his wife Sevda.

02:44:43.416 --> 02:44:45.954
We only found this out later.

02:44:46.418 --> 02:44:50.997
One night a loud noise woke us.
Ismail had stormed out of bed,

02:44:51.215 --> 02:44:52.840
to chase someone in the street.

02:44:55.761 --> 02:44:56.876
I'm ashamed to say,

02:44:58.013 --> 02:45:01.133
they were stealing
Sevda's underwear off the line.

02:45:01.642 --> 02:45:03.681
Ismail couldn't catch anybody.

02:45:04.187 --> 02:45:06.345
But he took it out on Sevda.

02:45:06.522 --> 02:45:08.847
The poor girl didn't even know.

02:45:09.441 --> 02:45:12.229
Next day, in the market,

02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:15.489
a few of the louts laughed at Ismail.

02:45:15.656 --> 02:45:18.859
Ismail pulled out a knife
and stabbed one of them.

02:45:22.038 --> 02:45:25.204
That's why he served
six months in jail.

02:45:27.501 --> 02:45:30.621
Well, Ismail was always wild.

02:45:31.672 --> 02:45:34.293
He was never really close to anyone.

02:45:35.301 --> 02:45:39.298
But when he got out, he became
even more suspicious and wild.

02:45:39.472 --> 02:45:41.844
He even stopped speaking to people.

02:45:42.016 --> 02:45:43.759
And then they fired him.

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:48.054
He became more introverted
and started drinking.

02:45:49.148 --> 02:45:50.940
He doesn't drink at home though.

02:45:52.860 --> 02:45:54.936
So he's not working now.

02:45:56.029 --> 02:45:59.446
We had to pay for the guy's operation
and compensation.

02:46:00.117 --> 02:46:02.275
And our debts grew.

02:46:02.620 --> 02:46:06.488
With only my salary,
and Ismail not working,

02:46:07.083 --> 02:46:08.577
it got difficult.

02:46:08.751 --> 02:46:10.494
We couldn't pay the rent.

02:46:11.170 --> 02:46:14.040
Mr Aydin is right, of course.

02:46:14.423 --> 02:46:17.958
We couldn't pay for a few months,
causing him problems.

02:46:19.803 --> 02:46:22.128
But hopefully,
I'll find a second job.

02:46:23.099 --> 02:46:24.427
I understand.

02:46:25.143 --> 02:46:26.720
I hope it all works out.

02:46:28.062 --> 02:46:31.477
I actually came to talk
about something related.

02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:36.686
I won't take too much of your time.
It's already late.

02:46:51.460 --> 02:46:53.867
Please take this and accept it.

02:46:58.050 --> 02:46:59.129
What is this?

02:46:59.635 --> 02:47:00.880
Open it.

02:47:19.196 --> 02:47:20.821
What is this, Mrs Nihal?

02:47:21.866 --> 02:47:23.774
Please don't misunderstand.

02:47:24.451 --> 02:47:26.907
I want to give you this money.

02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:29.407
Please take it.

02:47:30.707 --> 02:47:33.744
Yes, but... I don't understand.

02:47:33.919 --> 02:47:37.419
I mean, what is it for?
Why did you bring it to us?

02:47:38.257 --> 02:47:39.455
Don't worry.

02:47:39.633 --> 02:47:42.255
I don't want anything in return.

02:47:42.427 --> 02:47:44.836
And I don't expect you
to pay it back.

02:47:45.013 --> 02:47:49.924
Think of it as help from a friend,
and please accept it.

02:47:51.729 --> 02:47:53.603
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Nihal.

02:47:53.772 --> 02:47:56.394
I really don't know what to say.

02:47:57.109 --> 02:47:59.814
But this is a huge amount of money.

02:48:01.113 --> 02:48:02.986
How can I accept this?

02:48:03.491 --> 02:48:05.448
There's enough to buy a house.

02:48:06.285 --> 02:48:08.906
- What would people think?
- Mr Hamdi.

02:48:09.455 --> 02:48:11.578
No one needs to know.

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:16.619
This can stay between you and me.

02:48:28.098 --> 02:48:29.676
Welcome.

02:48:29.850 --> 02:48:31.012
Thank you.

02:48:31.852 --> 02:48:35.138
- Sorry for disturbing you so late.
- Not at all.

02:48:35.314 --> 02:48:38.232
Mrs Nihal is Mr Aydin's wife,
our landlord...

02:48:38.401 --> 02:48:40.228
I know. They just told me.

02:48:55.126 --> 02:48:56.324
What's up?

02:48:57.794 --> 02:49:00.665
Ismail, why don't you
come and sit down?

02:49:01.715 --> 02:49:03.126
Come, have a seat.

02:49:12.685 --> 02:49:16.303
Mrs Nihal was worried about Ilyas.

02:49:16.730 --> 02:49:19.304
She came to wish him good health.

02:49:20.526 --> 02:49:21.985
That's why she came.

02:49:25.573 --> 02:49:26.603
What's this?

02:49:30.327 --> 02:49:33.198
Mrs Nihal brought that money
to give us.

02:49:33.539 --> 02:49:34.737
Very kind of her.

02:49:39.628 --> 02:49:41.087
For what reason?

02:49:41.630 --> 02:49:44.750
Please don't get me wrong.
No special reason.

02:49:45.300 --> 02:49:48.172
I thought you might need it, and so

02:49:48.345 --> 02:49:50.800
you could get your stuff back.

02:49:57.313 --> 02:49:59.222
What does Mr Aydin say about it?

02:49:59.940 --> 02:50:01.600
He doesn't know.

02:50:02.234 --> 02:50:04.191
He doesn't need to know, either.

02:50:07.406 --> 02:50:09.149
Good.

02:50:19.835 --> 02:50:20.784
But all this money...

02:50:23.047 --> 02:50:24.921
isn't it a bit too much?

02:50:27.343 --> 02:50:29.003
On what basis?

02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:33.590
What made you think of this much?

02:50:33.974 --> 02:50:36.216
- Look, I didn't think anything.
- Sorry.

02:50:36.393 --> 02:50:38.681
I apologize. He's surprised, too.

02:50:38.854 --> 02:50:42.602
Ismael, why not go
and wash your face or something?

02:50:43.901 --> 02:50:45.312
No need.

02:50:46.152 --> 02:50:48.644
Then I'll get you a coffee.

02:50:49.115 --> 02:50:50.739
You better have one.

02:50:51.116 --> 02:50:53.785
Mrs Nihal,
let me get you another tea.

02:50:54.286 --> 02:50:55.864
This one has gone cold.

02:50:56.288 --> 02:50:59.574
- Don't bother.
- Please.

02:51:01.751 --> 02:51:03.127
Sevda.

02:51:13.431 --> 02:51:14.711
Now...

02:51:19.269 --> 02:51:20.645
Let's see...

02:51:22.523 --> 02:51:24.396
if the math is right.

02:51:31.949 --> 02:51:34.522
Now if this amount is...

02:51:36.787 --> 02:51:41.912
for little Ilyas who risked his life
to mend his father's broken pride.

02:51:49.383 --> 02:51:50.925
And if this is...

02:51:51.885 --> 02:51:54.091
for self-sacrificing brother Hamdi

02:51:54.263 --> 02:51:58.592
who had to go hand-kissing
because he looks after 5 people.

02:52:02.813 --> 02:52:04.272
And if this is

02:52:05.065 --> 02:52:08.350
for the drunkard father Ismail

02:52:08.945 --> 02:52:13.938
who got beaten up in front of his son
disgracing himself and his family...

02:52:26.337 --> 02:52:28.128
There's still some left.

02:52:30.633 --> 02:52:34.333
If that is for our heroine Mrs Nihal

02:52:34.803 --> 02:52:38.587
who tries to ease her conscience
by doling out charity

02:52:38.766 --> 02:52:42.466
to those less fortunate than her...

02:52:44.062 --> 02:52:45.972
then this money is just enough.

02:52:47.983 --> 02:52:49.774
You got the sums right.

02:52:55.073 --> 02:52:57.647
A truly kind thought, but...

02:52:59.619 --> 02:53:02.325
you forgot something,

02:53:03.082 --> 02:53:04.540
Mrs Nihal.

02:53:07.586 --> 02:53:09.412
The person in front of you

02:53:10.839 --> 02:53:13.793
is a filthy drunkard
incapable of appreciating

02:53:14.509 --> 02:53:16.419
all your kindness.

02:54:50.939 --> 02:54:53.146
I'm now looking at these.

02:54:53.650 --> 02:54:55.145
I'm looking.

02:54:55.444 --> 02:54:58.563
And I'm thinking,
man, this isn't a life.

02:54:58.739 --> 02:55:01.146
It's a fire scene in a stage act.

02:55:01.325 --> 02:55:03.650
No fucking life, it's something else.

02:55:03.827 --> 02:55:05.819
- True, very true.
- Am I wrong?

02:55:05.996 --> 02:55:07.028
Right.

02:55:07.205 --> 02:55:09.114
We have to stand straight.

02:55:09.791 --> 02:55:12.661
We'll keep standing,
standing upright.

02:55:12.836 --> 02:55:16.501
We'll say, "Come on, hit me here.
Hit me here".

02:55:16.631 --> 02:55:19.301
We'll stand straight as befits a man.

02:55:19.468 --> 02:55:22.469
We won't bend, cry.
Won't sob like a baby.

02:55:22.637 --> 02:55:23.633
Stand upright.

02:55:24.348 --> 02:55:26.506
That's what befits us, Mr Aydin.

02:55:27.726 --> 02:55:30.976
There are certain moral values
and beliefs today.

02:55:31.146 --> 02:55:33.186
They derived from religions,

02:55:33.315 --> 02:55:38.736
which have already been rejected
by many people in the world.

02:55:38.903 --> 02:55:44.243
If I reject the basis of such values,
why live a life based on them?

02:55:44.410 --> 02:55:47.909
Our life would be a lie then.

02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:51.698
Either support the foundation
of these values

02:55:52.501 --> 02:55:55.870
or consolidate or create new ones.

02:55:56.046 --> 02:55:57.422
Suavi, my brother,

02:55:57.589 --> 02:55:59.878
then you'll have to create them.

02:56:00.175 --> 02:56:03.757
- It's great if you can create, mate.
- But listen.

02:56:05.263 --> 02:56:07.469
We want to live life to the full

02:56:08.224 --> 02:56:12.353
but other people
can criticize you for that.

02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:16.649
You clash, you collide with them
when your paths cross.

02:56:16.816 --> 02:56:22.522
But curious, innovative people with
strong personalities do it different.

02:56:22.697 --> 02:56:25.651
Oddly enough,
this conflict nourishes them.

02:56:25.826 --> 02:56:29.195
In a way, it stretches them.

02:56:30.247 --> 02:56:32.820
Conflicts expand their minds

02:56:32.999 --> 02:56:35.372
and feed their creativity.

02:56:35.543 --> 02:56:37.702
Now when I look at them,

02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:42.007
they ignore the critics
because they have courage.

02:56:42.134 --> 02:56:44.209
That's the way we should be.

02:56:44.386 --> 02:56:46.793
They could come to us and say,

02:56:46.972 --> 02:56:50.341
"You drink all that wine,
stuff your faces,

02:56:50.475 --> 02:56:54.639
then talk about helping
the schools of the poor."

02:56:54.854 --> 02:56:57.974
I say we should ignore it
and move forward.

02:56:58.149 --> 02:57:00.902
For example, after the earthquake,
six years ago,

02:57:01.111 --> 02:57:04.029
when you didn't open
your hotel to victims

02:57:04.197 --> 02:57:07.816
but to aid organizations,

02:57:07.992 --> 02:57:10.235
maybe to line your pockets...

02:57:10.411 --> 02:57:13.745
I mean that's what
some people might think.

02:57:13.916 --> 02:57:16.288
That's quite interesting,
what he says.

02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:20.292
Or they might reproach you
for being well-heeled.

02:57:20.463 --> 02:57:21.958
- They might.
- Hold on.

02:57:22.132 --> 02:57:23.709
Just a minute.

02:57:24.051 --> 02:57:26.339
What's that got to do with it?

02:57:26.512 --> 02:57:28.089
How did you bring this up?

02:57:28.263 --> 02:57:30.006
I'm giving an example.

02:57:30.182 --> 02:57:33.099
Are you trying to imply something?

02:57:33.227 --> 02:57:37.935
If we didn't allow victims in,
there was obviously a good reason.

02:57:38.106 --> 02:57:41.890
It's easy to make unfounded
allegations, with no knowledge.

02:57:42.069 --> 02:57:47.822
Hundreds of people came from abroad.
Where were they supposed to stay?

02:57:48.575 --> 02:57:50.402
Where were they to stay?

02:57:50.577 --> 02:57:53.780
Who was supposed to save people
under the rubble?

02:57:53.955 --> 02:57:56.910
- I didn't deny that...
- Nobody thinks about that.

02:57:57.083 --> 02:57:58.661
It was just an example.

02:57:59.586 --> 02:58:04.414
Come on, these judgments you make
don't suit you, Mr Bülent.

02:58:04.591 --> 02:58:07.426
- Who's judging? I was saying...
- That's no good.

02:58:07.594 --> 02:58:11.295
I maybe didn't express myself right.
I meant something else.

02:58:11.472 --> 02:58:15.173
- Levent, you said it wrong.
- I didn't.

02:58:16.895 --> 02:58:19.386
There is some truth in what you said,

02:58:19.564 --> 02:58:21.890
but you expressed it badly.

02:58:22.066 --> 02:58:25.270
I'm just saying these people exist...

02:58:25.445 --> 02:58:30.901
What's your example
got to do with my case?

02:58:31.076 --> 02:58:34.077
I just said
people could talk like that.

02:58:34.246 --> 02:58:37.745
And another thing, hold on.

02:58:37.874 --> 02:58:40.080
I'm saying the same thing.

02:58:40.251 --> 02:58:45.495
There's no counting the donations
I've made over the years.

02:58:45.673 --> 02:58:47.132
Great, but I'm saying...

02:58:47.259 --> 02:58:49.002
Only yesterday,

02:58:49.303 --> 02:58:53.087
I donated a huge sum to charity.
How about that?

02:58:53.264 --> 02:58:58.057
And all these years
I have always kept my name a secret.

02:58:58.228 --> 02:58:59.971
- He's right.
- Bravo.

02:59:00.146 --> 02:59:02.223
I'm not criticizing.

02:59:02.399 --> 02:59:04.890
He just couldn't express himself.

02:59:05.068 --> 02:59:06.230
But I still can't get rid of

02:59:06.986 --> 02:59:10.651
the sarcasm and snide remarks.

02:59:11.199 --> 02:59:13.820
Is it fair,
just because we've got money?

02:59:13.994 --> 02:59:17.493
All I'm saying is
there are people like that.

02:59:17.664 --> 02:59:19.538
They exist. God damn them.

02:59:19.708 --> 02:59:21.535
I'd say God damn them too, but...

02:59:21.668 --> 02:59:27.585
judging like that is unacceptable
before understanding all this.

02:59:28.758 --> 02:59:30.798
I failed to express myself.

02:59:30.969 --> 02:59:34.468
I call for some morality,
some conscience, please.

02:59:35.307 --> 02:59:38.261
Speak up, son.
Tell him you put it wrong.

02:59:39.144 --> 02:59:41.848
What's that got to do with it?
It's irrelevant.

02:59:42.022 --> 02:59:43.516
It's not what he meant.

02:59:43.690 --> 02:59:48.850
I don't see what it's got to do
with morality and conscience.

02:59:49.029 --> 02:59:53.323
No, I can't accept such a judgment.

02:59:53.492 --> 02:59:55.283
Implicating him is a problem.

02:59:55.451 --> 02:59:58.323
Look, I've been silent for 15 years.

02:59:58.497 --> 03:00:02.873
My words come out before my thoughts.
If I had shut up...

03:00:03.042 --> 03:00:07.752
Is it fair to accuse me
just because we have a few bucks?

03:00:07.922 --> 03:00:11.339
Did I create this world?
That's how the system is.

03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:14.296
This is how God created it.

03:00:14.554 --> 03:00:15.835
What can I do about it?

03:00:16.014 --> 03:00:18.303
Justice doesn't even exist in nature.

03:00:18.474 --> 03:00:20.514
So why should it exist here?

03:00:20.685 --> 03:00:23.971
- Their talk is wrong.
- Are we meant to feel guilty?

03:00:24.147 --> 03:00:27.314
I'm saying the same thing but...

03:00:27.484 --> 03:00:31.149
you jumped on
morality and conscience.

03:00:31.321 --> 03:00:34.322
- I failed to express myself.
- He couldn't.

03:00:35.158 --> 03:00:38.325
Couldn't express himself properly.
You got carried away, son.

03:00:39.204 --> 03:00:40.746
You actually said nice things too.

03:00:40.913 --> 03:00:43.535
Everything has a logic.

03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:45.743
- He's right.
- Just like that.

03:00:45.918 --> 03:00:47.627
Whatever.

03:00:50.048 --> 03:00:51.756
We wined and dined.

03:00:52.634 --> 03:00:54.757
Let me get up, brother.

03:00:55.219 --> 03:00:57.177
I haven't slept for two days.

03:00:57.347 --> 03:01:00.597
OK. I'll give you a blanket.
Come along.

03:01:00.726 --> 03:01:02.967
You do that.

03:01:03.812 --> 03:01:09.054
This drunkard must now shut up
or he'll keep rattling like a tin.

03:01:09.276 --> 03:01:11.434
I wasn't going to talk though.

03:01:12.195 --> 03:01:14.188
But before I leave...

03:01:15.032 --> 03:01:17.570
this is your field, Mr Aydin...

03:01:17.742 --> 03:01:18.940
Not at all.

03:01:19.119 --> 03:01:22.784
I would like to quote Shakespeare,
by way of a conclusion.

03:01:29.296 --> 03:01:30.754
"Conscience

03:01:31.381 --> 03:01:34.417
is but a word that cowards use

03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:40.338
devised at first
to keep the strong in awe.

03:01:53.028 --> 03:01:56.396
Our strong arms be our conscience,

03:01:56.573 --> 03:01:59.028
swords our law."

03:02:02.662 --> 03:02:03.860
Good night.

03:02:06.374 --> 03:02:07.999
Hold on, hold on.

03:02:08.167 --> 03:02:13.921
Allow me to contribute
the following lines to this meeting.

03:02:14.758 --> 03:02:16.335
As a reply.

03:02:21.180 --> 03:02:22.591
Our infallible fate

03:02:22.766 --> 03:02:25.933
is to be deceived
in everything we attempt.

03:02:28.271 --> 03:02:32.600
I make brilliant plans
each morning...

03:02:35.278 --> 03:02:37.236
and fool about all day.

03:02:46.038 --> 03:02:47.497
There you go.

03:02:50.961 --> 03:02:53.416
You've pulled your trick again.

03:03:04.265 --> 03:03:05.808
Are you alright?

03:03:06.351 --> 03:03:08.225
Let it out, relax.

03:03:09.479 --> 03:03:11.056
- Let it go.
- So sorry.

03:03:11.272 --> 03:03:13.810
- Go on, let it all out.
- Oh my.

03:03:13.984 --> 03:03:17.104
Sorry, I've made a real mess.

03:03:17.278 --> 03:03:20.030
No problem.
Leave it, come on.

03:03:20.198 --> 03:03:22.237
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go out.

03:03:22.408 --> 03:03:27.200
Plenty of fine fresh air outside.
And snow. You'll be fine.

03:03:27.372 --> 03:03:30.706
Come on, my friend, come with me.

03:03:31.293 --> 03:03:33.997
Easy. Don't force yourself.

03:03:34.212 --> 03:03:35.623
Come on.

03:03:36.339 --> 03:03:39.044
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

03:03:39.217 --> 03:03:41.672
I'll lay you down here. Come on.

03:03:48.894 --> 03:03:51.349
Let's walk over there,
then we're done.

03:03:57.944 --> 03:04:00.614
He must be light, he's not sinking.

03:07:20.187 --> 03:07:21.938
- Hidayet, stop.
- What for?

03:07:22.148 --> 03:07:23.523
Pull over.

03:07:24.150 --> 03:07:26.276
I'm afraid
it won't start up again.

03:07:26.485 --> 03:07:27.944
- Back up a little.
- What?

03:07:28.154 --> 03:07:29.613
Put it in reverse.

03:07:48.883 --> 03:07:49.841
Stop.

03:08:13.908 --> 03:08:15.158
Mr. Aydin?

03:08:17.244 --> 03:08:20.080
Nothing, that's good, let's go.

03:09:15.219 --> 03:09:16.344
Fatma!

03:10:03.267 --> 03:10:04.309
Nihal...

03:10:05.144 --> 03:10:06.561
I haven't left.

03:10:07.438 --> 03:10:09.105
I haven't been able to.

03:10:11.734 --> 03:10:15.612
Could I have become old or crazy,

03:10:16.363 --> 03:10:19.199
or a different man?

03:10:19.408 --> 03:10:21.284
It doesn't matter what you think.

03:10:22.453 --> 03:10:23.536
I do not know.

03:10:30.336 --> 03:10:34.547
But this new man in me holds me back.

03:10:36.050 --> 03:10:38.343
Don't blame me.

03:10:45.309 --> 03:10:48.770
I know now
nothing's in Istanbul.

03:10:50.564 --> 03:10:52.816
Everything is strange to me,

03:10:53.025 --> 03:10:55.235
there as elsewhere.

03:11:00.533 --> 03:11:04.160
Know that I have no one else
but you.

03:11:07.248 --> 03:11:10.917
I miss you every minute,
at every moment.

03:11:13.379 --> 03:11:16.923
I would never tell you,
my pride prevents me.

03:11:19.593 --> 03:11:22.637
I know it would be terrible,

03:11:23.097 --> 03:11:25.890
if not impossible for me
to leave you.

03:11:27.852 --> 03:11:30.937
Just as I know
than you don't love me anymore.

03:11:38.612 --> 03:11:41.030
I know our past
will not return.

03:11:42.867 --> 03:11:44.742
I do not regret it.

03:11:53.878 --> 03:11:55.879
Take me as a servant,

03:11:58.757 --> 03:12:00.675
as a slave.

03:12:12.730 --> 03:12:14.522
Continue our life together,

03:12:15.983 --> 03:12:19.569
even in your own way.

03:12:29.538 --> 03:12:31.039
Forgive me.

03:13:03.572 --> 03:13:06.908
