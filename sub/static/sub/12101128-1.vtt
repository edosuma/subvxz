16:23.991 --> 16:26.825
Only way damn creepier.

16:26.825 --> 16:28.659
But there's no way it could have been.

16:28.659 --> 16:31.087
Not a person,  right? In the wall like that?

16:32.161 --> 16:35.071
Because I'm a crazy paramedic
on probation seeing shit?

16:44.292 --> 16:46.730
There's something about this place,

16:48.320 --> 16:50.320
isn't there?

16:53.206 --> 16:55.541
You saw something too.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.326
Let's try to wrap this job up as quickly as possible.

17:02.326 --> 17:04.790
You cool with that?

17:04.790 --> 17:06.042
Yeah.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.624
How did it go?

18:05.624 --> 18:06.640
Nothing out of the ordinary.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.658
Smashed my freakin' finger though.

18:10.658 --> 18:12.362
You'll live?

18:12.362 --> 18:13.705
Probably.

18:14.242 --> 18:16.292
I just won't enjoy it .

18:16.880 --> 18:18.720
You guys made good progress today.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.199
Yeah.

18:23.206 --> 18:25.737
We'll pick up the rest of the 
materials on the way home tonight.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.160
Be back first thing in the morning.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.243
All right.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.036
Feel free to use the sink inside.

18:36.292 --> 18:37.536
You fixed it.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.454
No, i'm good here.

18:41.797 --> 18:46.141
So. Bud, you were in 
the navy?

18:46.141 --> 18:48.075
The tattoo.

18:48.679 --> 18:50.280
Oh yeah.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.964
The frog man.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.163
Bud used to be a SEAL.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.977
I thought I recognized it.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.037
Being a tidewater girl and all.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.537
Well, it was a while ago.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.193
I guess that's it for today.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.289
I am loving the new digs.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.074
You're the handyman.

19:43.574 --> 19:45.417
It's a good gig, am I right?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.625
Is everything good here, Grace?

19:52.792 --> 19:53.756
Yeah.

19:56.003 --> 19:57.124
Thanks, Bud.

19:57.527 --> 19:59.367
See you tomorrow?

19:59.367 --> 20:01.587
You can count on it.

could I

21:09.148 --> 21:10.304
uh

21:11.042 --> 21:12.302
finish your wine?

21:12.459 --> 21:15.000
Knock yourself out.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.320
I am so sorry.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.550
But you know how my temper gets.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.694
Can you do me a favor?

21:39.694 --> 21:41.243
Hmm?

21:42.560 --> 21:44.714
Take out the trash?

21:45.385 --> 21:48.573
The fish will stink by morning.

21:48.573 --> 21:49.960
Yeah.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.834
Yeah sure.

[Chimp alarm clanking]

24:42.320 --> 24:44.911
Hey, let me ask you a question.

24:46.253 --> 24:48.292
Do I look depressed to you?

24:49.280 --> 24:50.744
Shit, I don't know, man.

24:51.214 --> 24:52.713
Isn't everyone?

24:56.160 --> 24:58.163
You know you do tend to  
look a little grumpy?

24:58.542 --> 24:59.834
Thanks.

25:00.521 --> 25:02.446
I mean like all the time.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.553
Surely this isn't news.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.594
See that?

25:08.594 --> 25:10.070
That look right there?

25:10.875 --> 25:12.364
Grumpy.

25:12.834 --> 25:15.248
Or as me 
I feign chipper.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.946
That way I limit the number of people I disappoint.

25:17.946 --> 25:19.782
Don't be so sure about that.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.886
Hey, look at that.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.189
Oh yeah, derecho.

Bud,

26:03.864 --> 26:05.488
Chad disappeared

26:05.488 --> 26:08.882
last night. He took out 
the trash and he never came back.

And the electricity is out.

26:10.756 --> 26:12.116
The phone is out.

26:12.116 --> 26:14.504
And. And my car 
wouldn't start.

26:14.504 --> 26:15.198
Hold on.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.720
All right? We'll sort it out.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.520
My phone's out of service too.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.954
We'll take a look around.

26:23.954 --> 26:27.448
Chad's probably just 
exploring the property.

26:27.448 --> 26:28.959
Or maybe fell into the lake.

freaking out.

Could be from a 
lightning strike?

With more crazies.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.363
Agreed.

Sorry.

40:40.337 --> 40:43.406
I just wanted to see if it actually worked.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.394
It does.

hands so congratulations.

41:06.824 --> 41:07.920
That's what I'm saying.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.120
So how do you transport a whole house?

41:17.920 --> 41:20.380
Maybe we didn't move.

41:21.084 --> 41:23.504
At least we didn't move in space.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.203
But rather

41:26.740 --> 41:29.054
perhaps we moved in time.

41:29.658 --> 41:31.195
Time?

The phrase was credited to Albert Einstein.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.154
Wait a minute.

42:01.490 --> 42:02.908
Didn't I see you on TV?

42:04.960 --> 42:05.917
Discovery channel.

42:05.917 --> 42:06.758
Yes.

42:06.758 --> 42:07.492
About UFOs?

42:07.492 --> 42:08.285
No.

42:08.285 --> 42:09.949
With that bozo-haired guy?

42:09.949 --> 42:11.280
What a piece of work.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.238
All right,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.073
the theory goes something like this.

42:17.250 --> 42:19.476
Black holes come in all sizes.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.454
There's one at the center of our galaxy.

42:22.454 --> 42:24.328
It's immense.

42:24.328 --> 42:27.282
A monster that swallows space and time

42:27.282 --> 42:29.836
and keeps the milky way from flying apart.

42:29.836 --> 42:33.910
But there are also micro black holes.

42:33.910 --> 42:39.403
Singularities smaller than a speck of dust.

42:39.403 --> 42:44.597
Capable of distorting 
space-time.

42:44.597 --> 42:48.531
If one orbited our solar system and passed through the earth,

42:48.531 --> 42:49.955
it could bend time.

42:49.955 --> 42:53.040
It could open a gate to a parallel dimension.

42:54.880 --> 42:55.988
Dr. Sheridan,

42:55.988 --> 42:59.552
open a gateway to where?

42:59.552 --> 43:00.706
The past.

43:00.706 --> 43:01.710
The future.

43:02.180 --> 43:05.430
Time doesn't need to be linear.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.153
We just experience it that way.

43:08.153 --> 43:09.287
A gate?

43:09.287 --> 43:10.820
One way?

43:11.167 --> 43:13.450
Not necessarily one way.

43:14.054 --> 43:15.918
Come on. I'll show you.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.005
See.

43:24.005 --> 43:28.129
I think that's one of two micro singularities.

43:28.129 --> 43:31.573
The storm is just an atmospheric by-product.

43:31.573 --> 43:32.907
That one is moving off.

43:32.907 --> 43:34.711
And there

43:35.852 --> 43:37.446
that's its binary companion,

43:37.446 --> 43:39.840
a second singularity moving in.

43:40.400 --> 43:40.994
So...

43:40.994 --> 43:42.455
what?

43:42.455 --> 43:44.119
We wait for that thing to hit us?

43:44.723 --> 43:47.272
Try to ride it back to our time?

43:49.840 --> 43:51.829
That's some crazy shit, doc.

43:51.829 --> 43:54.283
We're already in crazy.

43:55.693 --> 43:56.617
You know

43:57.288 --> 44:00.783
I've got a bottle of Jack Daniels inside.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.589
So what's up with this witch thing?

44:11.920 --> 44:13.204
Family tree?

44:13.204 --> 44:15.288
Yeah.

44:15.288 --> 44:19.912

44:19.912 --> 44:21.746

Pungo.

44:36.594 --> 44:37.653
Hah.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.998
So she was the witch.

44:40.535 --> 44:42.297
She was ahead of her time.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.584
Misunderstood.

44:47.920 --> 44:50.583
She healed sick people with herbs.

44:50.583 --> 44:51.951
She was a midwife.

44:54.640 --> 44:55.944
Earthy.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.907
Unchristian.

44:58.511 --> 45:00.684
And they drowned her for it.

45:02.160 --> 45:06.371
The governor of Virginia gave her a pardon just recently.

45:07.042 --> 45:08.195
No shit?

45:08.195 --> 45:10.999
God's honest truth.

45:17.980 --> 45:20.330
Do you pray, Bud?

45:21.337 --> 45:22.543
Oh god, no.

45:22.543 --> 45:24.087
I wish though.

45:24.087 --> 45:25.201
You wish?

45:25.872 --> 45:27.448
Angels?

45:27.448 --> 45:28.862
Deities?

45:28.862 --> 45:30.745
Afterlife?

45:31.819 --> 45:34.901
Seems like delusional comfort.

45:36.160 --> 45:41.250
We can all use a little delusional comfort.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.713
Or spooky entanglements.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.519
Wow.

45:52.526 --> 45:55.030
Can't make this stuff up.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.404
They're both witches.

45:59.679 --> 46:01.408
Okay, I'll bite.

46:01.408 --> 46:03.311
Grace and grace?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.032

46:05.032 --> 46:06.239

46:06.239 --> 46:09.746
I mean if both aren't magic I don't know what is?

46:09.746 --> 46:12.200

46:15.577 --> 46:17.822

first few chapters? Hell no.

Did you?

46:19.200 --> 46:20.284
Nope.

46:20.284 --> 46:21.350
Nobody did.

46:42.838 --> 46:44.911

1:26:12.137 --> 1:26:14.831
You mean the dark finger of death

1:26:14.831 --> 1:26:18.375
with its crushing black heart?

1:26:18.375 --> 1:26:20.528
Oh, yes.

1:26:21.535 --> 1:26:27.487
I ... I feel faint.

1:26:29.187 --> 1:26:30.710
As you should.

1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:34.919
For so do I.

1:26:36.866 --> 1:26:39.530
Poison is most disagreeable.

1:26:39.530 --> 1:26:40.914
What?

1:26:40.914 --> 1:26:41.928
Poison?

1:26:41.928 --> 1:26:43.842
But you drink from the same cup.

1:26:43.842 --> 1:26:45.234
Yes.

1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:49.840
We are bound in death you and I.

1:26:57.200 --> 1:26:59.840
And there is no need to pay the ferryman.

1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:05.048
We are almost done.

1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:31.964
You go get her.

1:27:31.964 --> 1:27:34.042
I'll hold down the fort.

1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:01.115
Witch: "Are you a hero?"

1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:06.978
Witch: "Are you the footsteps of doom?"

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.875
Witch: "Or rescue?"

1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:21.028
Enter the fool warrior.

1:28:21.028 --> 1:28:22.492
The old man.

1:28:22.492 --> 1:28:24.792
And the failed father.

1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:27.624
Grace?

1:28:27.792 --> 1:28:28.594
Grace?

1:28:28.594 --> 1:28:29.534
Wake up.

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:31.560
We gotta move.

1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:38.288
Where the hell is the key?

1:28:38.288 --> 1:28:41.040
How painful do you
want your death?

1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:42.534
I'm taking her with me.

1:28:43.004 --> 1:28:45.887
I'm not afraid 
of you like one of your pathetic followers.

1:28:50.855 --> 1:28:51.922
No?

1:28:55.816 --> 1:29:00.290
I can show you fear 
in a handful of dust.

1:29:02.237 --> 1:29:04.175
Dad!

1:29:04.792 --> 1:29:08.163
Help me!

1:29:09.707 --> 1:29:11.531
Shall I be cruel?

1:29:14.149 --> 1:29:16.177
Please!

1:29:17.091 --> 1:29:20.748
[Dramatic music]

1:29:37.048 --> 1:29:38.718
Help me!

1:29:38.718 --> 1:29:40.872
Or should I be merciful?

1:29:40.872 --> 1:29:42.366
It is not real.

1:29:42.702 --> 1:29:44.456
It is not real!

1:30:02.160 --> 1:30:02.786
Sam?

1:30:04.733 --> 1:30:07.337
I'm no mere illusion.

1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:10.826
Shall I turn him inside out?

1:30:11.363 --> 1:30:13.417
You're a cruel mean bitch!

1:30:36.329 --> 1:30:38.862
I am elemental.

1:30:38.862 --> 1:30:42.596
Earth, air and water are my medium.

1:30:42.596 --> 1:30:44.779
I am hate.

1:30:44.779 --> 1:30:46.453
I am pain.

1:30:46.453 --> 1:30:48.076
I am lust.

1:30:48.076 --> 1:30:52.625
All here love, worship and despise me.

1:30:52.625 --> 1:30:54.910
And I will live!

1:30:55.834 --> 1:31:00.700
The great storm comes for it is black like my heart.

1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:08.000
Ah, William.

1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:14.904
Have you come to betray me a second time?

1:31:17.388 --> 1:31:20.383
[Gunfire]

1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:32.074
Is this what freedom looks like?

1:31:32.074 --> 1:31:36.523
Oh what a world.

1:31:58.240 --> 1:32:01.986
You must hurry or you'll be stuck here forever!

1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:15.654
We gotta move!

1:32:16.325 --> 1:32:17.918
Right behind you.

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:43.454
I think we're gonna die.

1:34:43.454 --> 1:34:45.368
Then we die.

1:34:45.368 --> 1:34:46.792
We did the 
best we could.

1:34:46.792 --> 1:34:48.666
We did our duty.

1:34:49.203 --> 1:34:51.337
And rescued a princess.

1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:55.613
And fixed the house.

1:34:55.613 --> 1:34:57.390
Damn, right we 
did! We did good!

1:34:57.860 --> 1:35:00.310
Yep. We did good.

1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:04.904
I love you man!

1:35:06.113 --> 1:35:07.648
Now hold on.

1:35:08.856 --> 1:35:09.544
Sam!

1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:56.344
It works.

1:35:57.150 --> 1:35:59.634
It works.

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.532
The theory was right.

1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:07.454
We're freaking genius.

Sam?

1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:27.846
You're alive.

1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:30.904
I guess so.

1:36:31.307 --> 1:36:32.419
We made it?

1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:35.885
Where's Sam?

1:36:36.489 --> 1:36:38.444
Sam?!

1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:41.948
Over here.

1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:47.133
Wow.

1:36:47.603 --> 1:36:49.110
Shit, I'm not dead.

1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:51.204
Amazing.

1:36:51.204 --> 1:36:52.717
Cool.

1:36:52.717 --> 1:36:55.241
You're not going to die, buddy.

1:36:55.644 --> 1:36:57.443
We've gone way too far to give up now.

1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:00.604
Did you just call me buddy?

1:37:01.611 --> 1:37:02.415
Grace?

1:37:03.288 --> 1:37:05.062
Put pressure here.

1:37:05.062 --> 1:37:06.369
Back here.

1:37:06.369 --> 1:37:07.553
I'm gonna an ambulance.

Oh god, he's calling my 
old fire company.

1:37:11.211 --> 1:37:12.854
Hey, uh I need an ambulance.

1:37:12.854 --> 1:37:15.087
There's somebody here with a penetrating 
abdominal wound.

1:37:15.087 --> 1:37:16.551
What a bunch of misfits.

Bud: "He's lost a lot of blood."

1:37:17.745 --> 1:37:20.709
Bill the butcher's been on call since I've left.  
Now I'm really gonna die.

1:37:21.750 --> 1:37:23.204
Bud: "Yeah, that's the address."

1:37:23.741 --> 1:37:24.655
Hey.

1:37:25.259 --> 1:37:27.413
Seeing as how we've literally been through 
hell and back,

1:37:28.823 --> 1:37:31.794
do you think I could take you out on a date?

1:37:32.801 --> 1:37:34.875
Not a chance.

Wow.

You're crueler than the witch.

Well, I guess that's that.  

1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:03.083
So, no more danger of freaky time storms?

1:38:04.090 --> 1:38:06.687
Not for another 100 years.

she wanted you if she couldn't get back.  

1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:13.154
Synchronization and all.

1:38:13.154 --> 1:38:18.073
Well, she thought she was magical.

1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:20.920
Wasn't she though?

1:38:21.457 --> 1:38:23.826
You don't believe that?

1:38:23.826 --> 1:38:25.960
I don't know.

Yeah.
