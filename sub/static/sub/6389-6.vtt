00:09.396 --> 00:10.795
- I got the part!
- Congrats.

00:10.797 --> 00:12.397
- Yay.
- Way to go.

00:12.399 --> 00:14.433
You do realize
that Rath might have

00:14.435 --> 00:16.067
certain expectations now, right?

00:16.068 --> 00:19.204
Are you saying he expects me
to have sex with him

00:19.206 --> 00:20.371
or give him a blow job?

00:20.373 --> 00:21.640
So who recommended you?

00:21.642 --> 00:23.541
- Stu Beggs.
- My ex.

00:23.543 --> 00:25.209
He said that you probably
needed the work,

00:25.211 --> 00:27.045
that your husband isn't much
of an earner.

00:27.047 --> 00:28.613
I waxed a hooker today.

00:28.615 --> 00:30.882
She was young and cute
and totally down to fuck.

00:30.884 --> 00:32.717
Really?
Is this wrong?

00:32.719 --> 00:34.119
I can't tell anymore.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.121
Dude, you--you got me
a fucking hooker?

00:36.123 --> 00:37.955
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

00:37.957 --> 00:40.191
This is exactly what I thought
having a father would be like.

00:40.193 --> 00:43.727
- The--the clit's on top, right?
- Another happy customer.

00:43.729 --> 00:45.396
You know how you tell your
mother everything, you said?

00:45.398 --> 00:47.031
Are you gonna tell her
about this?

00:47.033 --> 00:50.368
- She would be totally pissed.
- Hmm. Good to know.

00:50.370 --> 00:52.436
What about me?
I impulse-remarried

00:52.438 --> 00:55.205
a depraved lunatic
who can't even get it up for me.

00:55.207 --> 00:57.374
I need a manager
who cares about me

00:57.376 --> 00:59.543
as much as about what me
can do for him.

00:59.545 --> 01:02.312
- I do, Goldie.
- Get me off this fucking show.

01:02.314 --> 01:04.882
- Why?
- Rath humiliated me.

01:04.884 --> 01:08.451
You're getting hard right now,
aren't you?

01:08.453 --> 01:10.086
Why does this keep happening
to me?

I just shit my pants.

- Oh, yeah.

02:37.939 --> 02:39.839

I'm a big fan
of all your wrongdoings.

02:53.822 --> 02:55.088

- Well, you used to work

02:55.090 --> 02:56.656
side by side with samurai, huh?

02:56.658 --> 02:58.758
He was just "Sam" to me--
Calvin, actually.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.359
Yeah, he said
you was a cool dude.

03:00.361 --> 03:01.761
He also said you like
sticking your pee-pee

03:01.763 --> 03:03.329
where it don't belong.

03:03.331 --> 03:04.664
Well, I like to think
that doesn't define me

03:04.666 --> 03:06.098
as a human being.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.500

that my pee-pee belongs

Oh, yeah.

03:10.605 --> 03:13.005
You gonna be my guy, Moody.

03:13.007 --> 03:14.407

to be quite punishing.

to maybe starting later

03:23.717 --> 03:24.983

is he going on about?

- Excuse me, Hashtag,

03:28.989 --> 03:31.256

- Ahh! Yo, yo, yo.

Pitches hurt my ears,
especially pitches from bitches.

03:33.294 --> 03:35.393
No offense--
y'all got the tendency

03:35.395 --> 03:36.995
of using too many words,
you know what I mean?

03:36.997 --> 03:38.896
Why use one word
when you can use ten, right?

03:38.898 --> 03:41.633
Yeah. [Laughs]
That's funny.

03:41.635 --> 03:43.335
- Actually, I can be quite brief.
- Goldie!

your pitch right now.

want to be set bitch?

up in here tonight?

to pull your pants down

about Levon?

more relaxed, confident.

06:09.144 --> 06:10.810

06:10.812 --> 06:12.812
has done wonders
for the young man's psyche.

08:53.604 --> 08:55.270
Oh, I'm doing scenes
with her, all right.

08:55.272 --> 08:56.904
I'm doing scenes with her
right now up in here.

08:56.906 --> 08:59.073
Ah, she's also
the mother of my son.

08:59.075 --> 09:01.243
- Oh! Oh, oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.245 --> 09:03.612
- You're not together?
- No, not currently.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.747
Mm.
So you ain't crushing that ass?

09:05.749 --> 09:08.250
Not--not--not at the present--
like, 20 years ago,

09:08.252 --> 09:09.784
and even then, I-I wasn't
so much crushing it

09:09.786 --> 09:11.318
as admiring it.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.787
I don't like to be too rough
with the ass.

09:12.789 --> 09:15.089
Oh, I like to destroy that shit.

09:15.091 --> 09:17.591
Mm.
I want to murder that ass.

09:17.593 --> 09:18.993
I understand
what you're saying, Hashtag,

09:18.995 --> 09:20.494
but your language is
so aggressive.

09:20.496 --> 09:22.363
You see, if--
if you murder the ass,

09:22.365 --> 09:24.098
then there's no ass left
to enjoy.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.699
Well, see, that's where
you're wrong, Moody.

09:25.701 --> 09:27.234
You know,
you gotta murder that ass

09:27.236 --> 09:28.602
so no other motherfucker
can enjoy that ass, right?

09:28.604 --> 09:29.970
No.

09:29.972 --> 09:31.171
It's like a metaphorical murder.

09:31.173 --> 09:32.438
- Oh, I--
- Yeah, you feel me?

09:32.440 --> 09:33.640
- I do feel you. I feel you.
- Cool.

09:33.642 --> 09:35.241
- You see that?
- Yeah.

09:35.243 --> 09:36.844
I'ma go see
if I can turn this bitch out.

09:36.845 --> 09:38.244
I'ma catch you later.

09:38.246 --> 09:40.747
Think about my words--
hashtag words.

09:40.749 --> 09:43.449
Mm-hmm. Thought about 'em.
Thought about 'em.

09:43.451 --> 09:44.751
What the fuck was that about?

09:44.753 --> 09:46.286
It seems your number one

09:46.288 --> 09:48.754
is warm
for your number 16's form.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.823
And he doesn't like the way
you're writing him.

09:50.825 --> 09:53.025
So it's not enough that I have
to fight with this motherfucker

09:53.027 --> 09:56.262
over expository dialogue, now
he feels entitled to my woman?

09:56.264 --> 09:58.030
Oh, she's your woman now?

09:58.032 --> 10:00.333
Come on, cut me some slack,
all right?

10:00.335 --> 10:03.069
I'm a little heated up.
She say anything about me?

10:03.071 --> 10:04.636
Well, she said you were
the perfect gentleman.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.572
- Good, good.
- Yeah.

10:06.574 --> 10:08.007
I'm trying, you know?
Usually I'm a fucking asshole.

10:08.009 --> 10:09.241
Yeah.

10:09.243 --> 10:10.642
Trying to take it easy with her.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.011
Right. But sometimes,
you know, you got to...

10:12.013 --> 10:13.445
What?

10:13.447 --> 10:15.181
Well, you know,
sometimes you got to--

10:15.183 --> 10:17.249
- sometimes you got to what?
- You know.

10:17.251 --> 10:18.818
Shit, here comes Shrek.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.352
That's my son
you're talking about--Shrek.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.087
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm all worked up.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.522
I got to head this shit off
at the pass.

10:23.524 --> 10:24.823
All right.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.658
- Guess what.
- Wait.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.428
You were born a pauper to a pawn
on a Christmas day,

10:29.430 --> 10:30.795
when <i>The New York Times</i> said

10:30.797 --> 10:32.264
God is dead,
and the war's begun.

10:32.266 --> 10:33.832
Shut up.
Come on, I hate that.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.934
- Nikki's here.
- I know. She's with Stu Beggs.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.168
Can I borrow some money?

10:37.170 --> 10:40.605
Oh, so Levon does like
his money. Why?

10:40.607 --> 10:43.574
- I want to bone her again.
- She's with Stu.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.110
So what?
She can't spare a few minutes

10:45.112 --> 10:46.778
- for some repeat business?
- Your mom is here.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.446
So? There's a ton of rooms
in this place.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.981
And it's very expensive.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.916
- Okay, I'll pay you back.
- No, you won't.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.917
God damn it, I'm really pissed
at you right now.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.586
I'm a little pissed at you
right now.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.321
[Sighs]
That feeling is back, you know,

10:57.323 --> 10:59.290
- like I-I got to fuck something.
- Okay.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.325
- I need a release.
- Look, I understand.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.193
Just--just try to find
a nice, quiet bathroom

11:03.195 --> 11:05.095
and go beat off--
you'll feel much better.

11:05.097 --> 11:06.364
Just make sure you clean up
afterwards

11:06.366 --> 11:07.898
and wash your hands, all right?

11:07.900 --> 11:09.500
Yeah, but now
that I got my dick wet,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.401
beating off just seems
kind of lame, you know?

11:11.403 --> 11:13.170
Yes, I get that.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.372
But masturbation is still gonna
be a huge part of your life.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.307
Even though you got laid,
girls aren't just gonna

11:17.309 --> 11:19.342
automatically
start hurling themselves at you.

11:19.344 --> 11:21.344
I should've just stayed
a fucking virgin.

11:21.346 --> 11:23.147
It would've been a lot better
not having a glimpse

11:23.149 --> 11:25.682
- of the promised land.
- Good talk.

11:30.655 --> 11:32.422
Ah.

11:32.424 --> 11:34.824
Are you sure you should be...
drinking?

11:34.826 --> 11:36.859
I'm not allergic
to vodka, asshole.

11:36.861 --> 11:39.162
Sorry.
Who would know?

11:39.164 --> 11:41.030
You know what I am allergic to?

11:41.032 --> 11:43.666
- Semen.
- Oh, really?

11:43.668 --> 11:45.134
Yeah, can't spit or swallow.

11:45.136 --> 11:46.669
Totally burns the back
of my throat.

11:46.671 --> 11:48.237
One time I took one up top.

11:48.239 --> 11:50.973
Fucking broke out in hives
and blotches.

11:50.975 --> 11:53.642
Blowing a load on me
is like throwing holy water

11:53.644 --> 11:54.977
on Linda Blair.

11:54.979 --> 11:57.646
[Both laughing]

11:57.648 --> 11:59.081
What up?

11:59.083 --> 12:01.483
I'm so fucking pissed
at Rath right now.

12:01.485 --> 12:02.918
Oh, why?

12:02.920 --> 12:05.053
He let Hashtag call me
a bitch today.

12:05.055 --> 12:06.955
That doesn't really seem
like Rath's style.

12:06.957 --> 12:08.724
Why would you take his side?

12:08.726 --> 12:12.127
I'm not taking his side.
Goldie, cooler heads, hmm?

12:12.129 --> 12:13.329
Cooler heads.

12:13.331 --> 12:14.763
First, he rewrites me,

12:14.765 --> 12:16.597
then he humiliates me
in front of Hashtag.

12:16.599 --> 12:18.967
I mean, he--he's trying
to send me a message, Charlie.

12:18.969 --> 12:20.936
He's out to get me.

12:20.938 --> 12:23.305
This is all part of his plan,
that slimy motherfucker...

12:23.307 --> 12:25.606
woman-hating dickhead.

12:25.608 --> 12:29.144
- Goldie. There she is.
- Rath, hi.

12:29.146 --> 12:30.611
- You good?
- Great.

12:30.613 --> 12:31.913
Good, I made sure they had

12:31.915 --> 12:33.214
some of that gluten-free shit
for you.

12:33.216 --> 12:35.082
- There you go.
- You're the best.

12:35.084 --> 12:37.385
What a great home--
beautiful.

12:37.387 --> 12:40.621
Work hard,
you'll get there, right?

12:40.623 --> 12:42.623
Hey, I hope
you're not using my party

12:42.625 --> 12:44.158
as an opportunity
to poach clients, huh?

12:44.160 --> 12:45.793
Never.

12:45.795 --> 12:47.261
As if anyone
would ever want to sign

12:47.263 --> 12:50.364
with this fucking
degenerate lunatic, right?

12:50.366 --> 12:53.400
Have fun.

12:58.206 --> 12:59.806
I can't tell you much,

12:59.808 --> 13:02.442
but I can tell you
that we're planning

13:02.444 --> 13:05.045
on putting you
in some seriously hot outfits.

13:05.047 --> 13:06.446
Truth.

13:06.448 --> 13:08.114
Shut the fuck up, Hugh.

13:08.116 --> 13:09.949
You're creeping out
the female lead of the show.

13:09.951 --> 13:11.451
Don't worry about it--
he has absolutely

13:11.453 --> 13:13.152
no decision-making power.

13:13.154 --> 13:15.054
And he loves cupcakes
and Coldplay

13:15.056 --> 13:16.623
and sticking pencils
up his pooper.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.525
Who doesn't love Coldplay?

13:18.527 --> 13:21.027
- And you are?
- Hank Moody--newbie writer.

13:21.029 --> 13:24.663
Be gentle with me.

13:24.665 --> 13:26.699
You're the one
who wrote the movie, right?

13:26.701 --> 13:28.467
I am one of 19 people
who wrote the movie

13:28.469 --> 13:30.003
that never came out, yeah.

13:30.005 --> 13:31.670
And you wrote
<i>Fucking & Punching?</i>

13:31.672 --> 13:33.839
I am only one of six people
who wrote that,

13:33.841 --> 13:35.674
which is why it's so damn good.

13:35.676 --> 13:37.676
It is good.
God, I love that movie.

13:37.678 --> 13:40.178
Aw, shucks.
Thank you.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.381

Can I be honest with you?

13:42.383 --> 13:44.450
If you must.

13:44.452 --> 13:46.452
I don't like the way Rath
is writing my character.

13:46.454 --> 13:48.987
You should probably bring
that up with Rath, then.

13:48.989 --> 13:51.490
I did, and he blew me off.

13:51.492 --> 13:53.125
Can we talk about it
for a minute?

13:53.127 --> 13:56.161
You mean, like, right now?

13:56.163 --> 13:58.096
I'll make it worth your while.

How's married life?

ups and downs, Stu.

in the proverbial hood, yeah.

14:14.213 --> 14:16.347
Yeah, wait, wait.
You know, there's something

14:16.349 --> 14:17.782
I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

14:17.784 --> 14:19.451
Oh, yeah?
What's that, Stu?

14:19.453 --> 14:23.087
I want to sleep
with Marcy again.

14:23.089 --> 14:26.558
Stu...

14:26.560 --> 14:28.592
what is wrong with you?

14:28.594 --> 14:30.894
I don't know.

14:30.896 --> 14:33.431
I mean, my career is on fire.

This television thing has me
shitting cash.

my castle is a-crumblin'.

14:41.107 --> 14:42.673
Look, look, look, look, look,

14:42.675 --> 14:45.342
I know you won her
fair and square,

14:45.344 --> 14:48.679
but I can't stop thinking
about that magnificent creature.

14:48.681 --> 14:52.048
You gotta move on, Stu,
'cause we are married, okay?

14:52.050 --> 14:53.183
Again.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.853
I know that.
I respect that.

14:55.855 --> 14:57.554
- Mm.
- You know...

14:57.556 --> 14:59.756
Marcy may very well be
your soul mate,

14:59.758 --> 15:03.293
but that woman was born
to be my sex partner.

15:03.295 --> 15:05.996
And I just miss her so much...

15:05.998 --> 15:08.598
so much.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.766
Like, this last time,

15:10.768 --> 15:12.402
she let me go down on her,

15:12.404 --> 15:14.170
and I wasn't able to get
my helmet

15:14.172 --> 15:16.339
into that silky pond of hers.

15:16.341 --> 15:19.008
You know,
she's so fucking tight, Charlie!

15:19.010 --> 15:21.243
I mean, she makes me feel huge.

15:21.245 --> 15:24.346
- And I'm already huge.
- I'm well aware, Stu.

15:24.348 --> 15:26.181
Now, when was this

15:26.183 --> 15:28.584
that she let you go
down on her again?

15:28.586 --> 15:32.922
It was way before you two
were remarried, of course.

15:32.924 --> 15:36.958

Okay, I get it. So what?

15:55.812 --> 15:58.279
have a proposal for you.

15:58.281 --> 16:01.983
And, yes, it is quite indecent.

16:01.985 --> 16:05.820
With your permission,
and hers, of course,

16:05.822 --> 16:10.158
I am willing to pay you guys
a cool $1 million

16:10.160 --> 16:13.627
if you will let me sleep
with her again--

16:13.629 --> 16:15.863
just the once,

17:24.365 --> 17:25.731
I had the option
of taking this show

17:25.733 --> 17:28.200
or some class-up-the-ass
BBC thing,

17:28.202 --> 17:30.068
and my agent talked me
into taking this one.

17:30.070 --> 17:32.203
- That's a bummer.
- Yeah.

17:32.205 --> 17:35.440
A big bummer.
Can you do me a favor?

17:35.442 --> 17:38.644
Can you please talk to Rath,
see if maybe he can kill me off?

17:38.646 --> 17:40.278
- [Groans]
- I promise...

17:40.280 --> 17:42.914
I'll make it worth your while.

17:42.916 --> 17:46.051
My head is spinning
with the possibilities.

17:46.053 --> 17:48.853
As it should,
but in the meantime,

17:48.855 --> 17:50.688
I have
another little confession.

17:50.690 --> 17:52.089
You have three tits and a dick.

17:52.091 --> 17:53.724
[Laughs]

17:53.726 --> 17:55.293
- [Snaps fingers]
- Almost.

17:55.295 --> 17:57.595
One of my very best friends
in the whole wide world

17:57.597 --> 17:59.930
- is Sasha Bingham.
- I know Sasha Bingham.

17:59.932 --> 18:01.699
I know you know Sasha Bingham.

18:01.701 --> 18:04.268
Sasha Bingham is the star
of <i>Fucking & Punching.</i>

18:04.270 --> 18:06.637
- She was, indeed.
- We had some good times...

18:06.639 --> 18:09.506
except for the time when
I accidentally fucked her mom.

18:09.508 --> 18:11.676
- That was unfortunate.
- She told me about that.

18:11.678 --> 18:14.945
She also said
you give really great head.

18:14.947 --> 18:16.613
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

18:16.615 --> 18:19.283
- That is so sweet of her.
- I know. She's sweet.

18:19.285 --> 18:21.751
That is just a very nice thing
to say about a person.

18:21.753 --> 18:23.086
Will you give her my best?

18:23.088 --> 18:24.988
Absolutely.

18:24.990 --> 18:28.292
Speaking of which, what do you
think defines great head?

18:28.294 --> 18:31.428
Oh, well, I-I guess you'd have
to ask the head-getter.

18:31.430 --> 18:33.530
Well, I mean,
I've had good head,

18:33.532 --> 18:35.799
but I don't know
what makes it great.

18:35.801 --> 18:39.703
I think you have to treat
the "bagina" like a person.

18:39.705 --> 18:41.971
And--and how do you treat
a person?

18:41.973 --> 18:44.440
Like you yourself
would want to be treated.

18:44.442 --> 18:45.942
I understand what you're saying.

18:45.944 --> 18:48.477
It just sounds so intellectual.

18:48.479 --> 18:51.114
After all, isn't it important
for a writer to show

18:51.116 --> 18:53.449
and not to tell?

18:53.451 --> 18:56.619
Oh, my.
Oh, dear.

18:56.621 --> 18:59.355
You do make a valid point.

18:59.357 --> 19:00.756
[Giggles]

19:00.758 --> 19:03.659
Permission to come aboard?

19:03.661 --> 19:05.728
Permission granted.

19:05.730 --> 19:08.431
[Laughs]

19:13.069 --> 19:14.837
[Moans]

19:14.839 --> 19:16.338
You're a very pleasant
actress, very agreeable.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.573
- Oh. [Clears throat]
- Hmm? I can do better.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.110
Oh, hello.

19:21.112 --> 19:22.510
- Hi.
- Hello.

19:22.512 --> 19:23.779
Sorry.

19:23.781 --> 19:26.281
Hi.
No, no.

19:26.283 --> 19:27.815
- Hello.
- Hi.

19:27.817 --> 19:29.851
Amy Taylor Walsh.
It is lovely to meet you.

19:29.853 --> 19:31.652
I believe we're gonna be
working together.

19:31.654 --> 19:33.721
Nice to meet you.
I'm a huge fan.

19:33.723 --> 19:36.223
- Great.
- Me too. I'm a huge fan.

19:36.225 --> 19:39.760
[Clears throat]

19:39.762 --> 19:41.995
Yeah.
Um, sorry about that.

19:41.997 --> 19:43.864
It's none of my beeswax.

19:43.866 --> 19:45.733
Hmm.
What's going on?

19:45.735 --> 19:48.501
Um, well, Hashtag asked me
to go for a ride in his Bentley.

19:48.503 --> 19:50.503
That's probably not a good idea.

19:50.505 --> 19:52.239
What, like going down
on the female lead of the show?

19:52.241 --> 19:53.573
Much like that.

19:53.575 --> 19:55.375
You should probably keep
the flirtation

19:55.377 --> 19:57.110
- with Hashtag to a minimum.
- I'm not flirting with him.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.879
He's just really fucking funny.

19:58.881 --> 20:01.047
He is fucking funny,
and Rath is fucking jealous.

20:01.049 --> 20:02.983
God, so much fuss
over an actress

20:02.985 --> 20:04.917
who hasn't worked in 20 years--
it's so fun.

20:04.919 --> 20:07.219
What can I say? You get
the boys all hot and bothered.

20:07.221 --> 20:09.088
Well, it's not like
I'm some commodity.

20:09.090 --> 20:12.091
I mean, I'm not interested
in Rath or Hashtag or anyone.

20:12.093 --> 20:14.160
I'm just really happy
to have an acting job.

20:14.162 --> 20:15.695
Mm-hmm.

20:15.697 --> 20:17.263
And I-I don't want
to complicate my life.

20:17.265 --> 20:19.231
Like when we kissed,
I really learned from that.

20:19.233 --> 20:21.366
That's right--we kissed.
I totally forgot about that.

20:21.368 --> 20:22.734
You forgot that we kissed?

20:22.736 --> 20:24.236
No, it was just
a figure of speech.

20:24.238 --> 20:27.006
Of course I remember.
And it was very nice.

20:27.008 --> 20:30.176
It was nice.
It was a familiar surprise.

20:30.178 --> 20:32.778
It was a perfect storm
of booze and nitrous.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.413
I was very vulnerable
in that chair.

20:34.415 --> 20:35.848
You totally took advantage
of me.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.216
You manipulated me

20:37.218 --> 20:39.250
with all these
bullshit compliments

20:39.252 --> 20:41.420
about what a great mother I am.

20:41.422 --> 20:43.054
It wasn't bullshit.
You are a great mother.

20:43.056 --> 20:45.156
- You're a fantastic mother.
- Don't do that.

20:45.158 --> 20:46.591
Mother Teresa's
got nothing on you.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.393
[Scoffs] That's mean.

20:48.395 --> 20:50.061
You're probably a better
kisser than she ever was, and--

20:50.063 --> 20:51.896
but who knows?
Maybe she had a rocking bod

20:51.898 --> 20:53.432
underneath that saintly frock.

20:53.434 --> 20:55.533
Just let me know
when you want to kiss again.

20:55.535 --> 20:57.435
- You just went down on a girl.
- Mmm.

20:57.437 --> 20:59.503
- Ew.
- What if I brushed my teeth?

20:59.505 --> 21:01.439
Come on, that's got to be
a bit of a turn-on--

21:01.441 --> 21:03.507
me offering to brush my teeth?

21:03.509 --> 21:07.712
- Why did you go down on her?
- It's a long story.

21:07.714 --> 21:10.414
But she heard I gave good head.
That's--you know...

21:10.416 --> 21:13.384
You do give good head.
I mean, I don't know.

21:13.386 --> 21:16.153
I don't even remember.
It was so long ago.

21:16.155 --> 21:17.588
Oh, fuck.

21:17.590 --> 21:19.323
- What?
- I think I'm hard.

21:19.325 --> 21:22.259
Is that from before or from us?

21:22.261 --> 21:23.894
Who can tell?
I can't differentiate.

21:23.896 --> 21:25.730
I mean, I-I don't know
that I'd want to.

21:25.732 --> 21:30.100
But I think there's only one way
to defuse this situation.

21:30.102 --> 21:33.270
How?

21:33.272 --> 21:35.906
Aah, get that pussy mouth away
from me!

21:35.908 --> 21:39.243
[Laughing]

21:39.245 --> 21:41.778
[Squeals]

21:41.780 --> 21:43.813
No, no!

21:43.815 --> 21:45.915
[Laughing]

21:45.917 --> 21:47.550
What the fuck?

21:47.552 --> 21:49.652
I told you this motherfucker
like to stick his pecker

21:49.654 --> 21:50.720
where it don't belong.

21:50.722 --> 21:52.389
Hey, I decide whose pecker

21:52.391 --> 21:54.491
goes in here
and whose doesn't, okay?

21:54.493 --> 21:56.726
And you're a very charming
and funny guy,

21:56.728 --> 21:58.595
but I'm a single mom,
and I'm not easily wooed,

21:58.597 --> 21:59.996
even with a Bentley.

21:59.998 --> 22:01.797
I got--I got a Ferrari.

22:01.799 --> 22:04.300
And, Rick,
I really enjoyed our date.

22:04.302 --> 22:06.503
And I-I'm so grateful to you
for giving me an acting job

22:06.504 --> 22:08.637
and making my childhood dreams
come true,

22:08.639 --> 22:11.073
but if the job comes
with strings attached,

22:11.075 --> 22:12.541
then I cannot
and will not do it.

22:12.543 --> 22:14.377
No, no.
No strings attached.

22:14.379 --> 22:16.112
The job is yours, Julia.

22:16.114 --> 22:18.814
I'll think about it.

22:18.816 --> 22:21.483
What you waiting for, Rath?
Fire his fucking ass.

22:21.485 --> 22:23.552
You don't tell me who to hire
and who to fire.

22:23.554 --> 22:25.020
It's my fucking show.

22:25.022 --> 22:27.188
My character
<i>is</i> the fucking show.

22:27.190 --> 22:28.323
And who says
it's your fucking character?

22:28.325 --> 22:29.625
Nice.

22:29.627 --> 22:30.626
And what the fuck are you doing?

22:30.628 --> 22:31.860
You know I like her.

22:31.862 --> 22:33.561
I know it looked like
funny business,

22:33.563 --> 22:35.330
but it was just a tickle fight--
I swear to God, honestly.

22:35.332 --> 22:39.367
Rath, you are not gonna
like this.

22:39.369 --> 22:41.202
There's fucking in the pool.

22:41.204 --> 22:43.371
Motherfuckers!

22:43.373 --> 22:45.506
Motherfuckers!

22:52.047 --> 22:54.114
Nine fucking bathrooms
in the fucking house,

22:54.116 --> 22:56.617
and the asshole's got to screw
in my pool, huh?

22:56.619 --> 23:00.054
Hey, Leon,
I was very clear--

23:00.056 --> 23:01.522
no fucking in my pool.

23:01.524 --> 23:03.458
Levon, what are you doing?

23:03.460 --> 23:05.860
Nikki, I'm paying you
very good money

23:05.862 --> 23:07.361
to be my date tonight.

23:07.363 --> 23:09.363
No, I know, Stu.
I'm really sorry.

23:09.365 --> 23:11.365
I just wanted to make
a little extra cash.

23:11.367 --> 23:14.068
And honestly, he said
that Hank would take care of it.

23:14.070 --> 23:15.735
So, really, this is all on you.

23:15.737 --> 23:17.704
I told you I wasn't gonna
lend you that money.

23:17.706 --> 23:19.873
I know, but then my head
got all cloudy.

23:19.875 --> 23:21.075
God, this is how young people

23:21.077 --> 23:22.443
get in trouble
with credit cards.

23:22.445 --> 23:25.244
She's a hooker?
You're a hooker?

23:25.246 --> 23:27.013
Yeah, pretty much.

23:27.015 --> 23:28.682
But on the upside, I get tested,

23:28.684 --> 23:30.851
like, all the time,
so we're good.

23:30.853 --> 23:32.085
This is so upsetting.

23:32.087 --> 23:33.687
You lost your virginity
to a hooker.

23:33.689 --> 23:35.388
Not--not just.
I mean--

23:35.390 --> 23:37.858
- Hey, now.
- I'm--don't be upset, mom.

23:37.860 --> 23:39.425
I mean, she's really cool.

23:39.427 --> 23:42.261
She--she's the coolest.
I think I'm in love.

23:42.263 --> 23:43.529
[Smooches]
Aw.

23:43.531 --> 23:44.797
You're in love with a hooker?

23:44.799 --> 23:46.232
No, actually,
this is pretty common.

23:46.234 --> 23:47.900
Guys fall in love with me
all the time.

23:47.902 --> 23:49.735
We never
should've moved to L.A.

23:49.737 --> 23:51.237
Did you use a condom, honey?

23:51.239 --> 23:53.306
- Yes.
- Good.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.108
I'm really sorry, mom--Hank
was just trying to help me out.

23:55.110 --> 23:56.876
I should've left it alone.
I should've been content

23:56.878 --> 23:58.711
having sex with her once
and called it a day.

23:58.713 --> 24:00.679
But, no, I had to fly
too close to the sun.

24:00.681 --> 24:03.749
- This isn't the first time?
- Here we go.

24:03.751 --> 24:05.618
I'm sorry.
I-I can't lie to my moms.

24:05.620 --> 24:07.319
Don't blame Hank. He thought
he was doing the right thing.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.821
And he totally was.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.422
I've never felt better
in my whole life.

24:10.424 --> 24:12.257
I feel like a great weight
has been lifted, mom.

24:12.259 --> 24:14.292
I'm glad dad got me a hooker.

24:14.294 --> 24:18.196
[Gasps] You got him a hooker?

24:18.198 --> 24:19.931
The way in which you ask that
makes me think

24:19.933 --> 24:23.301
you don't think
it's a very good idea.

24:27.273 --> 24:29.641
All: Oh!
- Oh, yes, okay.

24:29.643 --> 24:32.944
Not a very good idea at all.
I'm sorry, Julia.

24:32.946 --> 24:34.979
I-I thought I was doing
a good thing.

24:34.981 --> 24:36.447
Don't worry, dad.

24:36.449 --> 24:38.816
I-I-I'll smooth it out for you.
I promise.

24:38.818 --> 24:40.284
You happy now, Rath?

24:40.286 --> 24:41.920
Okay, not now, Goldie, not now.

24:41.922 --> 24:43.755
This is the fucking ship
that you run.

24:43.757 --> 24:45.423
Yes, this is the ship I run.
Look at me.

24:45.425 --> 24:47.824
I'm captain of the <i>HMS Fucktard.</i>

24:47.826 --> 24:49.427
That's why I'm gonna
take it out from underneath you,

24:49.429 --> 24:51.128
- because you don't deserve it.
- Be my guest.

24:51.130 --> 24:54.098
Knock yourself out
steering this ship of fools.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.499
I will.
You tell him, Charlie.

24:55.501 --> 24:57.168
- Tell him.
- Huh? Tell him what?

24:57.170 --> 24:58.936
Tell him he's disrespected me
for the last time.

24:58.938 --> 25:00.438
Oh, oh, okay.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.972
Rath, I think what Goldie
means to say is--

25:01.974 --> 25:03.674
Shut the fuck up now.

25:03.676 --> 25:06.009
Shutting the fuck up now.

25:06.011 --> 25:07.978
- You fucking pussy.
- What?

25:07.980 --> 25:09.312
What, does your suit come
with tampons?

25:09.314 --> 25:13.149
[Laughter]

25:13.151 --> 25:14.851
Does that suit come
with tampons?

25:14.853 --> 25:17.320
See, that's funny, right?
If it's funny, I laugh.

25:17.322 --> 25:19.322
You are actually fucking funny.

25:19.324 --> 25:21.491
- Am I actually fucking funny?
- Yeah.

25:21.493 --> 25:23.560
- Fuck you, Hashtag!
All: Oh!

25:23.562 --> 25:25.328
What the fuck is wrong
with you, woman?

25:25.330 --> 25:26.662
You think you can get away
with calling me a bitch?

25:26.664 --> 25:27.897
I didn't call you a bitch.

25:27.899 --> 25:29.599
I have respect
for all womankind.

25:29.601 --> 25:31.501
I simply said, "I don't take
pitches from bitches.

25:31.503 --> 25:32.902
Y'all use too many words."
That's it.

25:32.904 --> 25:34.804
Oh. Oh, okay.
That's a lot better.

25:34.806 --> 25:37.306
You tell him he can't talk
to me like that. Represent!

25:37.308 --> 25:39.475
Actually, I agree
with everything he says.

25:39.477 --> 25:42.011
My own wife, Marcy,
when she talks at me,

25:42.013 --> 25:44.814
the sheer volume of words--
it makes my ears bleed.

25:44.816 --> 25:46.682
Oh, this bald motherfucker
knows of which he speaks.

25:46.684 --> 25:48.317
That's right.
Thank you very much.

25:48.319 --> 25:50.185
All right. Oh, one of those too.
I like that one.

25:50.187 --> 25:51.220
- Excuse me.
- What?

25:51.222 --> 25:52.754
You're fucking fired!

25:52.756 --> 25:54.689
And you're fucking
batshit crazy, Goldie.

25:54.691 --> 25:56.525
- [Growls]
All: Oh!

25:56.527 --> 25:58.660
Oh, hey!
Be nice to my agent.

25:58.662 --> 26:01.263
Yo, Rath, where the fuck
you find these writers, man?

26:01.265 --> 26:02.964
You just pull outside
of a Home Depot and say,

26:02.966 --> 26:05.267
"Hop the fuck in"?

26:05.269 --> 26:07.802
These are some seriously tweaked
motherfuckers.

26:07.804 --> 26:10.705
All: Oh!
- [Coughing and retching]

26:10.707 --> 26:13.474
- Shit, shit.
- Goldie.

26:17.312 --> 26:19.247
[Groans]

26:23.052 --> 26:25.486
Riddle me this, Runks.

26:25.488 --> 26:26.820
How can I be in the doghouse

26:26.822 --> 26:28.956
with a woman
I'm not even dating,

26:28.958 --> 26:31.892
and why do I care
so fucking much?

26:35.264 --> 26:37.131
Do you think
you still have a job?

26:37.133 --> 26:39.066
I don't know.

26:39.068 --> 26:41.035
You think Goldie
still has a job?

26:41.037 --> 26:45.039
My guess would be
"Fuck, no."

26:45.041 --> 26:49.143
- What's wrong, pickle lips?
- [Crying] I'm broke, Hank.

26:49.145 --> 26:50.744
You mean like <i>broke</i> broke?

26:50.746 --> 26:53.947
Like totally and utterly broke.

26:53.949 --> 26:56.717
Like "I don't know how I'm gonna
pay the rent next month" broke.

26:56.719 --> 27:01.288
Like--like--like the kind
of broke that forces a man

27:01.290 --> 27:04.123
to do something desperate.

27:04.125 --> 27:05.958
I'm not gonna give you 20%,
Charlie.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.461
My next paycheck has to go
to supporting

27:08.463 --> 27:09.962
my son's new hooker habit.

27:09.964 --> 27:12.899
[Sobbing]

27:14.768 --> 27:16.669
We're so fucking fucked.

27:16.671 --> 27:19.271
Yes, we are fucking fucked,
but we've been fucked before...

27:19.273 --> 27:21.207
[Engine turning]

27:21.209 --> 27:24.177
in the ass,
legs pinned behind our ears,

27:24.179 --> 27:25.644
not a drop of lube.

27:25.646 --> 27:28.380
But we always come out smiling.
You know why?

27:28.382 --> 27:31.710
'Cause that's just the kind
of happy-go-lucky sluts we are,

27:31.830 --> 27:32.618
my man.
