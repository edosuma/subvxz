22:07.911 --> 22:09.978
I'm Dr. Hanson. How can I help you?

22:10.013 --> 22:12.247
We need to know if Tracy
Kelly was a patient here.

22:13.751 --> 22:16.653
May I ask what this is regarding?

22:16.687 --> 22:18.178
We're investigating her murder.

22:18.298 --> 22:21.021
We have reason to believe that
she was treated at your clinic.

22:21.056 --> 22:23.257
Oh.

22:23.291 --> 22:27.361
I'm sorry, I don't recognize her.

22:27.395 --> 22:30.331

22:30.365 --> 22:32.766

have a client waiting.

doesn't seem familiar.

22:48.687 --> 22:50.855
Her name was Tracy Kelly.
She was 34 weeks pregnant.

22:50.889 --> 22:53.057
She was taking prenatal
vitamins provided by this clinic.

22:53.092 --> 22:55.827
Huh. I wonder why she
doesn't seem familiar.

22:55.861 --> 22:57.829
Maybe someone gave them to her?

22:57.863 --> 23:01.065
A lot of our moms give away
unused stuff once they deliver.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.034
I'd like a list of your clients.

23:03.068 --> 23:05.036
Well, I'm sure you understand,

I can't just give it to you.

A match for the baby's DNA.

Jim's a teacher.

He and his wife have
been trying to have a kid.

24:29.784 --> 24:32.269
I was never able to carry at term.

24:32.389 --> 24:34.423
My eggs were fine and Jim is healthy,

24:37.093 --> 24:38.761
I'm sorry. [ Sighs ]

24:38.795 --> 24:40.529
We had nearly given up hope.

On two teachers' salaries,

24:41.931 --> 24:44.533
we didn't think we could
afford fertility treatments.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.536
How did you afford Dr. Hanson?

24:47.570 --> 24:49.905
He arranged for us to get a
second mortgage on our house.

24:49.939 --> 24:52.841
Um, did Dr. Hanson introduce
you to the surrogate?

24:52.876 --> 24:54.910
Yes. Tracy was a really nice girl.

24:54.944 --> 24:56.311
She called all the time,

We, um, we were beside
ourselves when the clinic called

25:10.126 --> 25:12.594
and told us that Tracy had miscarried.

Mr. and Mrs. Tolliver,
your baby is still alive.

Is your mother...

Breast-feeding.

Your mother is the most
wonderful kangaroo volunteer.

25:43.226 --> 25:46.576
My mother is a kangaroo?

25:46.696 --> 25:49.488
Well, studies have shown
that neonates thrive

25:49.508 --> 25:51.899
when there's skin-to-skin contact, so

25:51.923 --> 25:54.799
I arranged for your mom
to be a volunteer kangaroo.

And thanks to her, baby John
Doe's vitals have stabilized.

Nice to meet you. Hi.

We're his parents.

I'm sorry, but we're going to
need to do some DNA testing.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.314
Why?

27:12.348 --> 27:13.715
Because there is another family

27:13.750 --> 27:15.584
claiming that this is their baby, as well.

Oh, you know, I can clear that right up.

27:17.987 --> 27:20.856
He's not our biological
child, but he's ours.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.859
We arranged a legal adoption
through dream babies.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.994
What were you told
about the birth parents?

27:26.029 --> 27:28.363
That the mother was young and single

27:28.398 --> 27:31.099
and didn't have the
means to care for a child.

But, um, we do.

27:34.704 --> 27:37.372
We want to be parents.

27:43.780 --> 27:47.749
And how did you find this Russell? Online.

27:47.784 --> 27:50.719

arrangements were made that way.

We just met with him once
to sign the paperwork.

27:53.690 --> 27:55.691

27:55.725 --> 27:57.926

and the mother's expenses.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.528
It's all legal.

28:02.815 --> 28:06.304

process two weeks ago?

returning our phone calls,
