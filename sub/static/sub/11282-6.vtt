EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #072
"Everybody Hates Doc's"
CLOSED CAPTIONED

00:03.137 --> 00:04.238
CHRIS ROCK:
After I became the manager of
Tattaglia's football team,

00:05.273 --> 00:07.108
I only had time to work
at Doc's on the weekends.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.242
Working two days a week seemed

00:08.276 --> 00:10.078
like it was going
to be a breeze,

00:10.111 --> 00:11.645
and then Doc got a girlfriend.

00:11.679 --> 00:16.484
Hey, Chris, I want you
to meet my new leading lady.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.353
Look-a here, look-a here.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.388
Stacy.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.289
Hi.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.022
Hi.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.791
She'll be taking over
for me

00:23.824 --> 00:25.126
here on the weekends.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.295
Doc's told me
so much about you.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.097
He didn't tell me a thing
about you.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.498
What do you mean, "taking over"?

00:30.531 --> 00:33.534
Well, you know I can use
a little time off.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.237
So I'll be minding the store.
We'll get along great.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.571
And you'll be working

00:37.605 --> 00:39.140
for a much better-looking boss.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.508
Cool.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.511
And remember,
whatever she says goes.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.545
Yeah, no problem.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.147
Are these cans always so dusty?

00:46.180 --> 00:47.748
Problem.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.151
Stacy may have been
a dream come true for Doc,

00:50.184 --> 00:52.486
but she turned out
to be my worse nightmare.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.590
There, all done.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.527
Chris, you did it
all wrong!

00:59.560 --> 01:01.529
I want everything on the top
to go on the bottom,

01:01.562 --> 01:03.264
and everything on the bottom
to go on the top.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.599
Why?
Because she's crazy.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.801
Because I don't work for you,
you work for me.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.170
I told you she's crazy.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.003
And when you finish with that,

01:10.037 --> 01:11.071
I have some errands
for you to run.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.575
When she said I work for her,
she meant it.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.846
I had to go for groceries,
get her dry cleaning

01:18.879 --> 01:21.315
and mine her coal.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.586
And when you're done,
go get me a new bird.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.388
Believe it or not,

01:27.421 --> 01:29.357
Doc's girlfriend was only the
second-worst boss I've had.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.292
Mr. Fong was the worst.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.261
And I could only imagine
how hard it would be

01:33.294 --> 01:34.862
working for him again.

01:34.895 --> 01:39.167
Hey, quit imagining what it
would be like to work for me

01:39.200 --> 01:40.868
and get back to work,
Lionel Richie.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.739
I was happy
Doc had a girlfriend.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.608
Too bad I have to kill her.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.256
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.311
Since my father knew everything
there was to know

02:23.344 --> 02:25.646
about having jobs,
I decided to ask him

02:25.679 --> 02:27.248
what to do about Stacy.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.250
Hey, Dad, you ever had
a boss you didn't like?

02:29.283 --> 02:31.285
I never had one I did like.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.487
Why? You having trouble
with Doc?

02:33.521 --> 02:35.856
Nah, I love Doc,
it's his girlfriend who's...

02:35.889 --> 02:36.957
Whoa, whoa. Son,

02:36.990 --> 02:38.326
stop right there.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.860
That's Doc's woman.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.895
Whether you like it or not,
she's there to stay.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.232
You think so?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.766
The Beatles didn't break up
John and Yoko.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.702
If it comes down to you or her,
you're gonna be out of job.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.371
'Cause if you have a problem
with her,

02:50.404 --> 02:51.839
you're gonna have a problem
with Doc.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.974
But I've been on the job
with Doc for years.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.743
She's been on the job
for a month.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.979
Let's just say you two do
very different jobs.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.915
Let's just say what he does
to her, now she's doing to me.

03:01.949 --> 03:05.853
You getting paid to do whatever
keeps that woman happy.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.221
Like James Brolin.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.689
Why do I have to do that?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.558
That's why they call it
a "job," Chris.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.261
Apparently, you got it mixed up
with a vacation.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.595
There's nothing I can do?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.997
Well...

03:24.972 --> 03:27.007
Don't you think that's taking it
a little far?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.977
If it is,
then it must not be that bad.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.383
While I wanted less attention
from my boss,

03:35.416 --> 03:38.686
Tonya wanted more attention
from boys.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.024
Hey, Tonya.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.993
Do boys always pay attention
to you like that?

03:46.026 --> 03:47.495
Sometimes.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.263
Do you think I'm pretty?

03:49.297 --> 03:51.665
No!
It's not that, Tonya.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.601
Boys aren't paying
attention to me just
because I'm pretty.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.003
It's because now
I'm wearing a bra.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.471
A bra?

03:57.505 --> 03:58.939
Yep.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.408
That's why
boys like you?

04:00.441 --> 04:02.510
Yeah.
Hi, Tasha.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.577
How ya doing?

04:06.380 --> 04:09.517
Hi, Robert.
What are you doing here?

04:13.887 --> 04:16.824
Since having Stacy kidnapped
was out of my price range,

04:16.857 --> 04:18.626
I decided to make my case
with Doc.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.960
What are you
doing here, Chris?

04:19.993 --> 04:21.329
You don't work
till tomorrow.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.730
I came to talk to you
about Stacy.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.699
I love Stacy. She came by today
and brought me a pie.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.801
And if she was 13,

04:27.835 --> 04:28.769
I'd probably have
to take her from you, Doc.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.372
You'd have
to get past R. Kelly first.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.407
Ah, Stacy, mm!

04:33.441 --> 04:36.610
That is one fine... woman.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.045
Mm! I think

04:38.078 --> 04:39.480
she's a real keeper.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.549
What is it you wanted to ask me?

04:41.582 --> 04:43.684
Can you lend me money
for a kidnapping?

04:43.717 --> 04:46.053
Nothing. I just wondered
how you guys met.

04:46.086 --> 04:49.723
Well, that's a funny story.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.492
But not so funny
that we're gonna watch him

04:51.525 --> 04:52.926
while he tells it.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.396
Anyway, while Doc was talking
Stacy up,

04:55.429 --> 04:58.999
over at 'Nessa's
it was about to go down.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.035
Hi. May I help you?

05:02.069 --> 05:03.404
I hope so.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.439
I need a touch-up,
I need a little trim.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.741
I need some lowlights
and I need to get out of here

05:07.775 --> 05:08.976
inside of two hours.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.744
You need an
appointment.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.814
I'm sorry.
We're all booked up.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.882
No, you're not.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.083
There's an empty
chair right there.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.951
That client is running
a little late.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.553
She'll be here any minute.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.722
Well, I'm here,
and she's not.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.658
Excuse me. What do you think
you're doing?

05:24.692 --> 05:28.028
I don't understand
why I have to wait to be served

05:28.061 --> 05:29.129
while you hold
a spot for somebody

05:29.162 --> 05:30.964
that obviously doesn't respect
your business enough

05:30.998 --> 05:32.500
to show up here on time.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.134
Or is that why
the place is empty?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.703
Now wait a minute,
Miss Thing.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.005
I have two questions for you.
Who are you and...

05:38.038 --> 05:39.006
And who asked you?

05:39.039 --> 05:41.709
I'm Stacy Deveaux.
It's French.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.411
Mm, do you want to hear
some more French?

05:43.444 --> 05:44.712
VANESSA:
I know you.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.447
You the one been messing
with Doc.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.715
I am not "messing" with Doc.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.082
We're a couple.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.984
And that's a little bit
different than a mess.

05:51.018 --> 05:51.885
Not too much.

05:51.919 --> 05:52.986
Excuse me?

05:53.020 --> 05:53.954
You're excused.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.758
Okay, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.892
I'm sorry. We can't help you.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.761
Yes, you are sorry.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.596
And you don't need to help me.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.465
You need to help yourself.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.468
I know you are, but what am I?

06:07.501 --> 06:09.803
I asked Greg
what to do about Stacy,

06:09.837 --> 06:12.473
and he gave me the advice
he always gave regarding women.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.408
I don't know what
to tell you, dude.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.409
Thanks.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.177
Stacy really
that bad?

06:17.210 --> 06:20.481
Last weekend, she made me give
her grandmother a bath.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.583
Chris, I hear you sneaking out!

06:22.616 --> 06:24.618
Don't you leave me
in this tub again!

06:24.652 --> 06:26.920
Why don't you just quit?
You can find another job.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.021
Not like this one.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.858
I mean, I make decent money,
it's close to my house,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.826
and I can make my own hours.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.695
It's either Doc's
or I start dealing crack.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.064
How come she's not with Doc
anyways?

06:37.097 --> 06:37.965
Where is he?

06:37.998 --> 06:40.501
He plays chess in the park
on weekends.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.602
Just get her to go with him.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.836
Thanks, Captain Obvious.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.505
How am I supposed to do that?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.474
I don't know, citizen.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.443
Captain Obvious only gives you
the obvious solution.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.078
The rest is up to you.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.114
Kind oflike Google.

06:54.147 --> 06:57.184
While Doc tried
to protect his king,

06:57.217 --> 06:58.852
I tried to get rid
of his queen.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.223
Where's your old lady?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.025
I left her at the store.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.927
No need to bring
sand to the beach.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.962
Who you calling sand?

07:08.996 --> 07:10.263
I had to get Stacy with Doc.

07:10.297 --> 07:13.534
And once I went to the park,
I found out what I had to do.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.603
I had to get Doc to take sand
to the beach.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.904
Check.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.839
Checkmate.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.478
Here's your dress.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.013
They said to give you
this card.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.181
It's for another
dry cleaners you
might want to try.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.784
It's in Canada.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.487
Go get me some
egg foo yung at Woo's.

07:33.521 --> 07:34.988
Ooh, I need
some stamps, too.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.658
And then run by my
apartment and see
if the mail came in.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.259
I don't want
my check to get stolen.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.161
Before I went on my next run,

07:41.194 --> 07:42.229
I decided to give her
the runaround.

07:42.262 --> 07:46.500
So, um, what exactly
does Doc do on the weekends?

07:46.534 --> 07:47.968
He's playing chess at the park.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.838
At the park?
With the sugar daddies?

07:50.871 --> 07:52.139
The who?

07:52.172 --> 07:54.107
Oh, the sugar daddies.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.843
You know, that's what the ladies
call them.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.678
What ladies?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.580
The ones at the park.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.849
I can't get a girl to
talk to me at school,

08:01.882 --> 08:04.084
but these old men
have them fighting
over them.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.019
If don't have a woman
by the time I'm 60...

08:06.053 --> 08:07.521
...I'll kill myself.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.156
...I'm picking up chess
and going to the park.

08:09.189 --> 08:13.594
Mm, mm, mm,
I should have known better.

08:14.795 --> 08:15.929
Should have known better what?

08:15.963 --> 08:19.066
Known better than to listen
to a sneaky 15-year-old.

08:19.099 --> 08:22.536
It is the same thing
over and over again!

08:22.570 --> 08:24.672
And Stacy is tired of it!

08:24.705 --> 08:26.674
Stacy is not a fool.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.141
When Stacy smells smoke,

08:28.175 --> 08:29.677
Stacy doesn't stand around
and wait for the fire!

08:29.710 --> 08:32.212
Stacy is leaving!

08:32.245 --> 08:33.747
Referring to yourself
in the third person.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.115
It's not just
for athlete's anymore.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.784
What do you want me
to tell Doc?

08:36.817 --> 08:40.621
Tell Doc he can kiss...

08:40.654 --> 08:41.655
Your black...?

08:41.689 --> 08:44.825
Don't tell Doc anything.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.594
It's not your job.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.663
First time she ever said that.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.599
I was like Cupid's retarded
little brother.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.033
Damn, I'm good.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.740
After I dropped
the bomb on Stacy,

08:59.773 --> 09:03.176
unfortunately, Stacy
dropped the bomb on Doc.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.013
Hey, Doc.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.681
What are you
doing here?

09:07.715 --> 09:09.650
Where's Stacy?
She's gone.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.886
I found this letter.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.990
She said it's over.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.661
Called me every
name in the book.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.663
You can never find
that book at the library.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.098
I don't understand.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.001
Did something happen yesterday?
No.

09:28.035 --> 09:32.606
Unless you think me sabotaging
your relationship is strange.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.676
I just can't figure it out.

09:37.778 --> 09:38.912
You okay?

09:38.946 --> 09:40.380
I'm not feeling very well.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.382
I'm gonna go in the back

09:42.415 --> 09:44.084
and lie down.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.687
Get that bottle
of whisky for me.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.990
At least he didn't ask me
for a box of tissues.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.225
And get me that box of tissues.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.130
Doc hadn't needed
whiskey and tissues

09:57.164 --> 10:00.233
since Maceo Parker
left James Brown's band.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.636
At Tonya's school,

10:02.670 --> 10:07.975
her first day of wearing a bra
alsoinvolved a box of tissues.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.643
Because, as it turns out,

10:09.677 --> 10:11.979
they were useful
for the end of relationships

10:12.012 --> 10:13.647
and for the beginning.

10:13.681 --> 10:16.349
Hi, Tonya.
Hey, Tonya.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.686
Inside of two minutes,
Tonya discovered

10:18.719 --> 10:21.121
bras not only
got you attention,

10:21.154 --> 10:23.023
they got you favors.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.826
Can I buy you lunch?
Can I do your homework?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.294
They got you gifts.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.662
Voila!

10:28.696 --> 10:30.230
You bought me a car?!

10:30.263 --> 10:33.667
I-If you don't like it,
I could get you another
one-- but I'll need a day.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.402
And they also
got you questions.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.404
Tonya, that's a nice necklace--
where'd you get it?

10:37.437 --> 10:39.372
Oh, this boy gave it to me.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.409
Well, give it back--
you're too young to be
getting gifts from boys.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.445
Julius, don't get carried away--
it's just a plastic necklace.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.447
Next it'll be
a plastic bracelet,

10:47.480 --> 10:48.248
then a plastic ring.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.950
I want this to
stop at the neck.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.319
He said that
till she turned 35.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.987
Hey, Drew, how's Doc?

10:54.021 --> 10:56.056
I didn't see him today--
he closed the store.

10:56.089 --> 10:56.790
He's all depressed

10:56.824 --> 10:58.391
because his girlfriend
left him.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.426
What?
Well, you
ask me,

10:59.459 --> 11:01.261
Doc just dodged a bullet.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.463
She was nothing
but a gold digger anyway.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.067
What's a gold digger?
It's a woman who's with
an older man for his money.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.736
Isn't that an "old digger"?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.103
Just because Doc
has a little money

11:10.137 --> 11:11.772
doesn't make her a gold digger.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.474
Besides, what's wrong with
Doc having a younger woman?

11:14.507 --> 11:17.044
Is that what you're gonna
say to me when I turn 60?

11:17.077 --> 11:19.246
You just gonna leave
me and run off

11:19.279 --> 11:20.714
with a 35

11:20.748 --> 11:22.750
She should be about 12
right about now.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.085
Why don't you run out and
buy her a plastic necklace?

11:25.118 --> 11:28.355
Of the million things my father
could've said at that moment,

11:28.388 --> 11:32.159
he chose the smartest one--
nothing.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.995
Did Doc say when
he was gonna reopen?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.830
He said he might never reopen.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.766
I got rid of Stacy, my job

11:38.799 --> 11:40.801
and Doc's will to live--
way to go, dummy.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.410
ROCHELLE :
Tonya!

11:50.443 --> 11:52.245
Tonya, are you up there?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.282
Tonya?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.323
What are you doing?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.025
:
I was looking for you.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.760
Oh, well, it's time
for you to go to school.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.062
Okay.

12:17.938 --> 12:22.810
While Doc was feeding the bums,
losing Stacy was eating him up.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.823
You spoken to Stacy?

12:35.856 --> 12:39.426
No. She won't see me.

12:39.459 --> 12:43.797
Drew said that you
were thinking about
closing up the store.

12:43.831 --> 12:47.567
I'm gonna pack up my things
and move to Florida,

12:47.600 --> 12:49.837
buy a boat...

12:49.870 --> 12:51.538
be sad there.

12:51.571 --> 12:52.873
You're leaving?

12:52.906 --> 12:55.175
I know.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.278
I know how much you
liked that job, Chris.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.848
I'm sorry this
had to happen.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.783
Especially since
it was my own fault.

13:15.929 --> 13:19.532
When my mother found the bra
in my father's sock drawer,

13:19.566 --> 13:22.469
she stared at it like
the woman was still in it.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.938
Over at Stacy's,
I didn't know what was worse,

13:24.972 --> 13:26.506
having to confess
what I had done

13:26.539 --> 13:28.942
or feeling like
I was in the Bronx Zoo.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.911
So, what'd you want
to talk to me about?

13:30.944 --> 13:33.881
You got to give Doc
another chance.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.183
Chris...

13:36.216 --> 13:37.851
Doc is a liar.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.520
And I know that you want
to take up for him,

13:40.553 --> 13:42.990
but he doesn't deserve
another chance.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.858
Ooh! He is like

13:44.892 --> 13:46.894
all the other men
I've ever dated!

13:46.927 --> 13:50.397
He lied, they lied,
because they're liars.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.365
The story of
the Bush Administration.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.934
Doc's not like that.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.502
He is.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.939
Chris.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.307
Don't...

14:00.340 --> 14:02.175
grow up to be like that.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.913
No matter how much
you think you may
hurt a woman's feelings,

14:05.946 --> 14:08.248
you have to tell her the truth.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.317
She may hate you,

14:10.350 --> 14:11.952
she may burn down your house

14:11.985 --> 14:13.186
or pour bleach
on your clothes,

14:13.220 --> 14:16.089
or... attack your
new girlfriend with ants

14:16.123 --> 14:17.657
or take every dime
you make.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.327
She may scratch your car
with a rake

14:20.360 --> 14:23.430
or use your home phone
to call China long distance.

14:23.463 --> 14:27.667
Or she could put milk
and detergent in your gas tank.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.437
Or put turpentine
and nail polish remover

14:30.470 --> 14:32.439
and itching powder
in your underwear.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.108
She may glue your private parts
to your leg.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.944
She may send
an assassination threat

14:36.977 --> 14:39.212
to the president with
your return address.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.447
Uh, Stacy?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.015
Hm?

14:42.049 --> 14:44.251
Doc didn't do anything.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.020
It was me-- I lied.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.023
Chris...

14:50.057 --> 14:54.127
don't you see how he's using
a child to make excuses for him?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.528
He's not.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.966
The truth is, Stacy...
I don't like you,

14:58.999 --> 15:01.568
and I didn't like how hard
you were making me work.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.536
I was trying to get rid of you.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.205
Trying to break you and Doc up.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.008
What

15:08.041 --> 15:09.342
You're making me
clean your house!

15:09.376 --> 15:10.643
You missed a spot.
See?

15:10.677 --> 15:13.013
Chris, everybody likes me.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.016
No. Nobody likes you.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.185
Except for Doc and Drew--
and Drew doesn't count;

15:18.218 --> 15:19.452
he just likes pie.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.454
How's that for honest?

15:21.488 --> 15:24.224
Now she's gonna burn
your house down.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.692
Are you gonna burn
my house down?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.460
No.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.429
Glue my eyelids shut?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.998
Chris, no.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.966
Just a little surprised.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.567
A lot surprised.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.238
Well...

15:38.271 --> 15:40.240
Doc really misses you.

15:40.273 --> 15:44.011
He didn't do anything
to deserve this,
and neither did you.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.312
So...

15:45.345 --> 15:46.946
just wanted to
say I'm sorry.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.086
Chris...

15:53.120 --> 15:56.723
I am very disappointed in you.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.526
And as soon as you finish
washing the dishes,

15:59.559 --> 16:02.095
I want you out of my house.

16:02.129 --> 16:02.996
Where you going?

16:03.030 --> 16:07.100
I'm going to get my man.

16:07.134 --> 16:10.470
Unless Apocalypto
throws a spear in you.

16:10.503 --> 16:14.107
* It's a thin line
While one innocent man
was off the hook,

16:14.141 --> 16:15.742
another was on death row

16:15.775 --> 16:20.013
* Between love and hate...
and didn't even know it.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.482
* It's a thin line
I love this song.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.553
Dinner smells delicious.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.055
What is it?

16:28.088 --> 16:30.623
Two breasts.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.427
* It's 5:00 in the morning...
Since when have you
been interested in guns?

16:34.461 --> 16:38.131
Since I found this bra

16:38.165 --> 16:39.499
in your sock drawer!

16:39.532 --> 16:41.801
* I knock on the door...
Rochelle...

16:41.834 --> 16:43.270
What?

16:43.303 --> 16:45.772
If my father had
been paying attention,

16:45.805 --> 16:47.174
he would've noticed
a few things.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.146
I don't know anything
about that bra.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.814
I've never seen
that bra in my life?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.250
So what was it doing
in your sock drawer?

16:57.284 --> 16:58.485
I have no idea.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.287
Oh. Did a pair
of your socks

17:00.320 --> 17:02.489
have a date last night
and get lucky?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.391
Or maybe a pair
of your socks

17:04.424 --> 17:07.427
thought it was a bra
trapped inside socks' body!

17:07.460 --> 17:08.595
Or maybe...

17:08.628 --> 17:12.265
you had a friend over,
and she put 'em there.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.833
Even if I had a friend...

17:13.866 --> 17:14.867
Shut up.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.270
...and I was crazy enough
to bring her over...

17:17.304 --> 17:18.171
Shut up.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.306
...do you think

17:19.339 --> 17:21.141
I'd be crazy enough
to put a bra

17:21.174 --> 17:23.676
in my sock drawer
when I know you do the laundry?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.178
Would you shut up!

17:25.212 --> 17:26.813
So you thought about this?

17:26.846 --> 17:28.415
Itoldyour ass to shut up.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.416
No!

17:29.449 --> 17:32.319
Then if youdidn't put it there,

17:32.352 --> 17:34.187
who did?

17:34.221 --> 17:37.290
* It's a thin line
I don't know.

17:37.324 --> 17:41.228
* Between love and hate...

17:41.261 --> 17:42.829
ROCHELLE:
Okay,

17:42.862 --> 17:46.566
I'm gonna ask
this question once.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.801
But before I ask it,

17:48.835 --> 17:53.740
I want y'all to understand
what the stakes are.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.408
Because if y'all say

17:55.442 --> 17:58.178
that you've never seen
that bra before,

17:58.211 --> 17:59.779
I'm gonna kill your father.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.649
Yeah, and then I'm
gonna go to jail,

18:02.682 --> 18:03.716
and then you guys

18:03.750 --> 18:05.185
are gonna be split up

18:05.218 --> 18:06.119
and sent to live
in foster care.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.189
Sounds like a BET
movie-of-the-week.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.124
So, does everybody understand?

18:11.158 --> 18:13.160
Okay.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.163
Okay, the question is,

18:16.196 --> 18:18.865
did anybody
sitting at this table

18:18.898 --> 18:22.235
put that bra in your
father's sock drawer?

18:22.269 --> 18:23.636
No.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.637
Wasn't me.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.576
We have a winner.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.578
Okay, boys, you
can go to bed now.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.148
Gladly!

18:35.182 --> 18:37.750
Julius, you
can leave, too.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.154
You're lucky.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.327
Okay, Tonya,
talk to me.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.263
W-Well, I saw these boys

18:50.297 --> 18:51.931
paying attention to girls
who wear bras,

18:51.964 --> 18:53.533
so I stole Tasha's,

18:53.566 --> 18:55.668
because I wanted some
of that attention, too.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.371
Baby...

18:58.405 --> 19:02.209
Tonya, that's not the kind
of attention that you want.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.212
You want boys to look
at what's in your heart,

19:05.245 --> 19:06.846
not what's in your bra.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.182
In my sister's case,
they were both empty.

19:09.216 --> 19:12.585
Tonya, you're
moving too fast.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.288
I mean, you're not
ready for this.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.490
What did you do,
stick tissue in it?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.626
Yeah.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.262
Okay, well...

19:22.295 --> 19:25.632
Tonya, you having
a bra is like...

19:25.665 --> 19:29.202
you buying a saddle
before you get the horse.

19:29.236 --> 19:32.572
You know, boys will
pay attention to you,

19:32.605 --> 19:34.674
but they're not really
looking at you,

19:34.707 --> 19:36.476
they're admiring
your saddle.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.744
And-and-and...

19:37.777 --> 19:39.779
when you do
get the horse,

19:39.812 --> 19:42.215
then everything
is different,

19:42.249 --> 19:44.551
because then you
need the saddle.

19:47.254 --> 19:51.258
Wait, are we talking
about bras or saddles?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.826
JULIUS :
Saddles!

19:53.860 --> 19:55.562
It wasn't pretty,

19:55.595 --> 19:58.598
but Doc had gotten his nights
back with his queen.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.633
You know
your king's in check?

20:00.667 --> 20:03.536
He most certainly is.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.605
Stacy was back with Doc

20:05.638 --> 20:07.907
and out of the store
on weekends,

20:07.940 --> 20:09.942
which was all I ever wanted.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.745
Doc had said he was
getting another cashier.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.782
Whoever it was, they would
have to be better than Stacy.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.917
Hey, Lionel Richie,
you're late.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.287
Get busy. Scrub floor.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.256
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.858
