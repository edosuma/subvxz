00:10.137 --> 00:13.517
- I wanna talk and I wanna
talk now.

00:13.655 --> 00:15.931
You had your chance, Lilly.

00:16.068 --> 00:18.827
- What?
No, no, Kyle. Kyle...

00:20.310 --> 00:23.379
- This is going to be fun.
- No!

00:23.517 --> 00:26.310
- If you could
tell me one thing,

00:26.448 --> 00:28.620
what happened to Jean?

00:28.758 --> 00:31.379
I killed her.

00:31.517 --> 00:33.793
- I'm here to give you this
opportunity to resign.

00:33.931 --> 00:35.344
I'm going to the press.

00:35.482 --> 00:37.517
And I will ruin your -- life.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.896
- Is that about right?
- Mr. Vice President--

00:42.034 --> 00:45.068
- No, no.
Let him go on.

00:45.206 --> 00:48.034
- No ma'am,
he is way off base.

00:48.172 --> 00:52.137
- Is he?
- Yes ma'am, he is.

00:52.275 --> 00:54.103
I'm not so sure.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.517
The man wants to talk.

00:58.655 --> 01:00.103
Let's talk.

01:00.241 --> 01:04.103
- Uh-oh, Victoria wants to talk.

01:04.241 --> 01:07.172
- Hunter, this man--

01:07.310 --> 01:09.620
Baby, can I go first?

01:09.758 --> 01:12.310
Please do.

01:12.448 --> 01:15.724
- This man would be nothing--

01:15.862 --> 01:18.068
An Alderman.

01:18.206 --> 01:20.034
- An Alderman.
- Yes, yes.

01:20.172 --> 01:24.310
- On a third-rate city council.

01:24.448 --> 01:27.862
- No...a mother --
dog catcher.

01:29.931 --> 01:31.793
Had it not been for us.

01:31.931 --> 01:33.724
Had it not been for us.

01:35.689 --> 01:39.689
- And you come in here with
this bullshit.

01:41.758 --> 01:43.724
Honey, I think he's trying to
threaten us.

01:43.862 --> 01:45.620
Mm.

01:45.758 --> 01:47.034
As I said...

01:47.172 --> 01:50.448
Bullshit.

01:50.586 --> 01:53.241
- Look at him.

01:53.379 --> 01:57.413
- Sitting there so pathetic.
- I see him.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.448
Are you both done?

02:00.586 --> 02:02.827
Baby, you ain't Barack.

02:05.586 --> 02:08.517
- And we haven't even started
yet.

02:08.655 --> 02:10.551
- I'm just trying to get the
correct information

02:10.689 --> 02:14.793
so I can get to the bottom of
this before it goes nuclear.

02:14.931 --> 02:17.103
- Nuclear?
Honey...

02:17.241 --> 02:20.034
- Yes. Nuclear.

02:20.172 --> 02:22.068
Hmm.

02:22.206 --> 02:24.206
We can show you nuclear.

02:24.344 --> 02:27.344
- Yes, we can.
- Sir...

02:27.482 --> 02:31.517
- We can show you
how we handle a weak,

02:31.655 --> 02:35.896
pathetic attempt at a coup.

02:36.034 --> 02:38.275
A coup?

02:38.413 --> 02:42.137
That's what this is.

02:42.275 --> 02:44.206
- And we know how to handle
a coup.

02:46.689 --> 02:48.344
- Ladies and
gentlemen,

02:48.482 --> 02:50.034
the President and the
First Lady.

03:12.862 --> 03:14.931
- I can assure you I'm not
trying to pull a coup.

03:15.068 --> 03:19.448
Oh, I think you are.

03:21.103 --> 03:22.862
Trying to overthrow the
government.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.034
- Mmhmm, that's what he's
doing, honey.

03:27.172 --> 03:29.379
And we will not stand for it.

03:29.517 --> 03:31.896
- I'm trying to get to the
truth.

03:32.034 --> 03:36.379
- Your truth is not something
you can trust.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.103
I trust my sources.

03:39.241 --> 03:41.965
- Well, you better be damn
sure you can.

03:42.103 --> 03:44.068
- 'Cause we're gonna bury your
ass.

03:44.206 --> 03:47.206
- I just want the
truth and the American people--

03:47.344 --> 03:51.034
- Can go -- themselves.

03:53.448 --> 03:55.862
I'm the only American that
matters.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.310
- I think the people would see
that differently.

04:00.448 --> 04:06.482
- You believe that, you're even
dumber than I thought.

04:06.620 --> 04:10.413
- We tell them what and how
to think.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.965
The truth is the truth.

04:12.103 --> 04:14.241
That will determine how people
think.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.724
And this, this is the truth.

04:17.862 --> 04:20.034
- This is a bag of --.

04:20.172 --> 04:23.413
And it's a bag of lies.

04:23.551 --> 04:27.172
- And you just pissed
off the baddest mother --

04:27.310 --> 04:30.034
in Washington.

04:30.172 --> 04:31.413
- Sir--

04:31.551 --> 04:35.517
- No, I'm not talking about
him, dear.

04:35.655 --> 04:38.758
You're looking at the wrong one.

04:38.896 --> 04:40.758
- He doesn't know
your truth, honey.

04:40.896 --> 04:45.448
- No, he doesn't know my thirst
for blood.

04:47.310 --> 04:48.965
I will kill a bitch

04:49.103 --> 04:53.034
and step over her body to get to
butter on the table.

04:53.172 --> 04:54.586
I've seen her do it.

04:54.724 --> 04:56.137
Sir, we shouldn't do this.

04:56.275 --> 04:58.931
- No, we didn't
start this, Donald.

04:59.068 --> 05:04.620
- But oh, ho, ho, ho,
we're gonna finish it.

05:04.758 --> 05:07.931
- Get your bitch ass out this
office.

05:08.068 --> 05:11.862
- And if I hear so
much as a word,

05:12.000 --> 05:16.103
if you breathe a word of this...

05:16.241 --> 05:18.379
Don't tell him, honey.

05:18.517 --> 05:21.413
Keep him guessing.

05:21.551 --> 05:23.482
- I like that.
- Yeah.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.034
Okay.

05:25.172 --> 05:26.862
Go -- yourself.

05:31.068 --> 05:32.620
Sir.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.448
Eli.

05:38.448 --> 05:40.000
Ma'am?

05:40.137 --> 05:42.172
How are your children?

05:42.310 --> 05:44.034
Oh, that's right.

05:44.172 --> 05:47.931
They're at that posh little
middle school.

05:48.068 --> 05:49.689
- There's one thing that you
cannot do

05:49.827 --> 05:52.448
and that is threaten my
children.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.137
- Did we just do that?
- No.

05:56.275 --> 05:59.758
We would never threaten
your children.

05:59.896 --> 06:03.068
I was just asking about those
little bastards.

06:03.206 --> 06:07.517
But now that you brought it
up, threats and all,

06:07.655 --> 06:09.586
we'll kill those mother --.

06:17.689 --> 06:19.068
So much for a resignation.

06:21.241 --> 06:24.862
- Sir, did you think that
was wise?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.620
To hell with that guy.

06:26.758 --> 06:28.896
Sir, he is the Vice President.

06:29.034 --> 06:31.517
- I mean he could--
- Do nothing.

06:31.655 --> 06:35.551
- Ma'am.
- We made his punk ass.

06:35.689 --> 06:38.172
- Ma'am--
- What?

06:38.310 --> 06:41.034
- I don't think you should ever
underestimate a man's desire

06:41.172 --> 06:43.275
for power.

06:43.413 --> 06:45.068
Or a power trip.

07:00.758 --> 07:02.551
- What the hell is that fool
thinking, Donald?

07:02.689 --> 07:04.586
- I don't know, sir.
- Son of a bitch.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.310
- You know what?
I'll give him a call and see if

07:07.448 --> 07:09.620
- I can talk him out of this, huh?
- Alright, do that.

07:09.758 --> 07:11.206
But find out who he's talking
to.

07:11.344 --> 07:12.724
Who's he getting his information
from?

07:12.862 --> 07:14.379
Yes, sir.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.793
- And look, I don't care if he
is the Vice President.

07:17.931 --> 07:21.034
He breathes a word of this,
we bury him so deep

07:21.172 --> 07:23.344
they're not gonna be able to
find him with a sonar.

07:23.482 --> 07:25.689
I'm on it, sir.

07:33.034 --> 07:34.896
- Could you have driven any
slower?

07:35.034 --> 07:37.551
- Excuse me, I was speeding
the whole way here.

07:37.689 --> 07:40.586
- You call that speeding?
- Would you relax? She's fine.

07:40.724 --> 07:42.275
You don't know that.

07:42.413 --> 07:44.103
- Well, freaking out about it
isn't gonna help.

07:44.241 --> 07:47.275
- So just stay calm.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.344
Here, put this on.

07:54.034 --> 07:56.137
A ski mask, really?

07:56.275 --> 07:58.586
- What, you want to just go in
there and blow this shit?

07:58.724 --> 08:01.655
- At this point all I want is
Kyle.

08:01.793 --> 08:04.827
And you'll get your chance.

08:04.965 --> 08:09.068
- Phone's ringing.

08:15.275 --> 08:17.482
- Yes sir?
- Hey. Where are you guys?

08:17.620 --> 08:19.931
- On the way. We had
to make a quick stop, sir.

08:20.068 --> 08:22.379
- Well, what's going on?
- It's Lilly, sir.

08:22.517 --> 08:25.793
- The Chief of Staff's wife?
- Correct, sir.

08:25.931 --> 08:27.241
What about her?

08:27.379 --> 08:29.275
- She's with us, and she needs
to be rescued.

08:29.413 --> 08:30.965
- So she's in danger?
- Yes, sir.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.793
- No, no, no, that's too
risky.

08:32.931 --> 08:34.655
I need you guys here at the
White House.

08:34.793 --> 08:36.310
- No sir, but with
all due respect,

08:36.448 --> 08:39.068
this is not happening without
her.

08:39.206 --> 08:40.862
- Excuse me?
- She's valuable,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.655
she can help corroborate
our story.

08:42.793 --> 08:44.241
We need all the help we can get.

08:44.379 --> 08:46.000
- Look, I just really pissed
them off

08:46.137 --> 08:47.793
and I feel like a sitting duck
here.

08:47.931 --> 08:49.413
- Sir, do you not trust
your detail?

08:49.551 --> 08:52.758
- No, not after what I just did.
- Okay, we'll come to you now.

08:52.896 --> 08:54.103
- Max...
- What?

08:54.241 --> 08:55.620
- No.
- Okay listen,

08:55.758 --> 08:57.206
I'm gonna stay in plain sight.

08:57.344 --> 08:59.137
- Sir, I assure you,
you will not be harmed.

08:59.275 --> 09:00.655
- It's after you leave--
- Okay.

09:00.793 --> 09:02.413
Well, my wife is on her way
here.

09:02.551 --> 09:03.827
Do you trust her detail?

09:03.965 --> 09:05.724
No, I don't trust any of them.

09:05.862 --> 09:07.103
- Sir, just stay put in your
office.

09:07.241 --> 09:09.103
- I'll get Sam on the line.
- Sam?

09:09.241 --> 09:10.965
- We can trust him.
- Are you sure?

09:11.103 --> 09:12.344
Yes, we are.

09:12.482 --> 09:14.586
Just stay put, we'll have
him come to you.

09:14.724 --> 09:17.137
- Okay, hurry.
- We will.

09:17.275 --> 09:20.965
- Listen, I really pissed them
off, so I mean it, hurry.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.551
- We'll be there soon, sir.
This shouldn't take long.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.068
Thank you.

09:27.586 --> 09:28.896
Are you happy now?

09:29.034 --> 09:30.551
You know we should be there
with him.

09:30.689 --> 09:32.517
- We could just gonna walk
right through the front door

09:32.655 --> 09:36.620
- of the White House?
- You did, didn't you?

09:36.758 --> 09:39.379
We should be there.

09:39.517 --> 09:43.379
- I don't know why this feels
like a setup.

09:43.517 --> 09:48.206
- Well, it might be,
but we're still going.

09:52.034 --> 09:54.379
- Look, I'm just gonna go in
and check on her

09:54.517 --> 09:55.724
and then we can--

09:55.862 --> 09:57.896
Meet our fate.

10:00.448 --> 10:04.206
We can.

10:04.344 --> 10:06.862
To the end?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.793
To the end.

10:19.344 --> 10:20.586
This is Sam.

10:20.724 --> 10:23.344
- Four-six-zero-two.

10:23.482 --> 10:25.103
Yeah.

10:25.241 --> 10:27.206
- The Vice President wants to
see you.

10:27.344 --> 10:30.068
- What?
- Yeah, he's there now.

10:30.206 --> 10:33.206
- What's this about?
- Just go talk to him.

10:33.344 --> 10:35.172
- Okay, I'm stepping away now.
I'm on it.

10:35.310 --> 10:37.724
Call me when you can, okay?

10:52.620 --> 10:55.758
- Hey.
- Hey, can I...

10:55.896 --> 10:57.724
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:57.862 --> 10:59.448
Thanks.

11:09.724 --> 11:11.448
Are you okay?

11:11.586 --> 11:13.206
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:15.827 --> 11:17.310
You don't seem fine.

11:19.551 --> 11:20.965
I'm fine.

11:21.103 --> 11:23.758
Is Dale here?

11:23.896 --> 11:25.689
Yeah, he's in his room.

11:25.827 --> 11:27.241
Okay.

11:27.379 --> 11:29.517
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait...

11:29.655 --> 11:32.758
You're just gonna walk away
from me like that?

11:32.896 --> 11:34.965
I just want to talk to him.

11:39.379 --> 11:41.655
- Tell me what's going on,
Sharon.

11:41.793 --> 11:44.068
Fine.

11:44.206 --> 11:46.724
Can I just talk to him, please?

11:46.862 --> 11:48.689
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:48.827 --> 11:50.482
Yeah.

11:55.344 --> 11:58.068
- Allan, listen, I know this is
difficult for you,

11:58.206 --> 12:01.896
but I need you here and I
need you here right now. Okay?

12:02.034 --> 12:03.896
This is a lot to handle.

12:04.034 --> 12:06.068
So I need you to come in.

12:27.448 --> 12:29.413
- --!

12:29.551 --> 12:31.965
How is she?

12:32.103 --> 12:34.689
Shit!

12:34.827 --> 12:36.344
- - --.

12:36.482 --> 12:38.896
- She won't talk.
- Really?

12:39.034 --> 12:41.344
- Nope.
- Put her on the phone.

12:41.482 --> 12:42.655
Here you go.

12:45.379 --> 12:48.172
- Lilly...
- Donald.

12:48.310 --> 12:51.448
- Stop it, Donald.
- Oh, I'm not doing anything.

12:51.586 --> 12:53.655
- Then make him stop.
Donald, please.

12:53.793 --> 12:55.896
- Wait, wait, wait,
you wanted to play hard chick,

12:56.034 --> 12:57.482
right?

12:57.620 --> 13:01.931
I, uh...I'm sorry.

13:02.068 --> 13:06.896
Nah, do me a favor,
baby, hm?

13:07.034 --> 13:08.896
Okay.

13:09.034 --> 13:10.275
Are you listening?

13:10.413 --> 13:12.689
- Yeah, yeah, I'm
listening.

13:12.827 --> 13:15.103
Do us a favor.

13:15.241 --> 13:18.620
- Okay Donald, what's
the -- favor?

13:18.758 --> 13:22.275
- You see that man next to you
with those pearly-white teeth?

13:22.413 --> 13:24.275
Tell him what he wants to know.

13:24.413 --> 13:26.758
- I don't know anything,
sweetheart.

13:26.896 --> 13:30.103
- Ooh baby,
that's not gonna please him.

13:30.241 --> 13:32.068
What do you want me to do?

13:32.206 --> 13:33.655
You want me to make
something up?

13:33.793 --> 13:35.620
- No, you think I
want you around here lying? No.

13:35.758 --> 13:39.517
All I want you to do is tell
the truth.

13:39.655 --> 13:42.413
I don't know anything!

13:42.551 --> 13:44.655
- Oh yeah, yeah,
you know something.

13:44.793 --> 13:46.517
Please.

13:46.655 --> 13:49.137
- Baby,
just talk to the man. Huh?

13:49.275 --> 13:51.103
- I can't believe--
I can't you, Donald.

13:51.241 --> 13:53.068
- Well, I can believe you and
all this bullshit

13:53.206 --> 13:55.172
- you've been causing.
- Okay, okay.

13:55.310 --> 13:57.413
Alright, well then just let me
go and I'll leave.

13:57.551 --> 13:58.689
I swear, I swear.

13:58.827 --> 14:00.620
- Leave?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:00.758 --> 14:03.758
Listen to me, you are way
too valuable to me

14:03.896 --> 14:05.241
to let you leave home.

14:05.379 --> 14:08.413
- You understand that, right?
- Please.

14:08.551 --> 14:10.724
- Kyle?
- Yes, sir?

14:10.862 --> 14:12.517
- Make that shit hurt.
- Donald...

14:12.655 --> 14:14.379
Ooh, yes sir.

14:14.517 --> 14:16.551
- Donald...
you -- -- bitch!

14:22.655 --> 14:25.586
- Let somebody else do your
- - work, huh?

14:25.724 --> 14:27.344
You doing this all for four
inches?

14:27.482 --> 14:29.862
Okay.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.275
- Way more
than that, baby.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.379
- Kyle, Kyle, listen, Kyle.
- ...and three.

14:37.724 --> 14:41.448
- I wanna talk to you.
- I figured you would.

14:45.379 --> 14:48.310
- You know?
- Know what?

14:48.448 --> 14:50.689
About what happened.

14:50.827 --> 14:53.965
No, but I have an idea.

14:54.103 --> 14:56.206
Okay, what do you think?

14:56.344 --> 14:59.068
- It's something with the
President.

14:59.206 --> 15:01.275
How do you know?

15:01.413 --> 15:06.000
- Kyle is a strange guy,
isn't he?

15:06.137 --> 15:08.034
Has he contacted you?

15:08.172 --> 15:10.965
No, and I hope he doesn't.

15:11.103 --> 15:13.034
Okay, alright.

15:13.172 --> 15:15.068
Will you let me know if he
does?

15:15.206 --> 15:17.068
Yeah, but why?

15:20.758 --> 15:26.517
- Well, he came to the store
and he kidnapped me

15:26.655 --> 15:29.689
and brought me to the
President.

15:29.827 --> 15:32.379
- What?
- Yeah.

15:32.517 --> 15:34.896
To the White House.

15:35.034 --> 15:39.275
The President wants me to be
his mistress.

15:39.413 --> 15:40.655
- Sharon, that's--

15:40.793 --> 15:43.896
- No, no, that's--
that's not all of it.

15:44.034 --> 15:49.827
He had an apartment for me,
stocks in my name,

15:49.965 --> 15:52.965
money, everything.

15:53.103 --> 15:54.931
You're kidding me, right?

15:55.068 --> 15:59.413
- I wish I was.
But no, I'm not.

15:59.551 --> 16:02.068
Okay...

16:02.206 --> 16:03.793
What?

16:03.931 --> 16:06.344
- If he's anything like Kyle,
if he wants something,

16:06.482 --> 16:09.379
he's not gonna stop until he
gets it.

16:09.517 --> 16:11.206
- Well, he's not getting this,
so--

16:11.344 --> 16:15.206
- No, you don't understand,
you have to be so careful now.

16:15.344 --> 16:17.034
What do you think I'm doing?

16:17.172 --> 16:19.172
- Yeah, but you know, you can't
go anywhere near them again,

16:19.310 --> 16:21.310
okay?

16:21.448 --> 16:23.241
Dale, I didn't ask for this.

16:23.379 --> 16:27.758
- I know, but you just need
to...

16:30.206 --> 16:31.965
What?

16:32.103 --> 16:33.931
- I think you should just keep
Kareem around you

16:34.068 --> 16:36.724
- from now on.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.034
For what?

16:38.172 --> 16:41.241
For protection.

16:41.379 --> 16:43.620
- I don't, I don't think it's
that bad.

16:43.758 --> 16:44.896
You serious?

16:45.034 --> 16:47.758
They kidnapped you,
and they shot me.

16:47.896 --> 16:50.379
Good point.

16:50.517 --> 16:53.241
You remember this guy?

16:53.379 --> 16:54.551
The Chief of Staff?

16:54.689 --> 16:59.482
- Yeah, so he's having an
affair with Kyle,

16:59.620 --> 17:03.103
which is why he had me shot.

17:03.241 --> 17:05.103
- What?!
You're kidding.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.758
No, I'm not.

17:06.896 --> 17:08.482
- Are you s--
- They're crazy.

17:08.620 --> 17:10.827
We have to stay away from
them.

17:10.965 --> 17:14.275
Oh my God, wow.

17:14.413 --> 17:17.172
What did he say to you?

17:19.965 --> 17:24.448
He threatened to have me
killed if I even saw Kyle again.

17:28.413 --> 17:30.931
- Dale, we have to go to
the police, we have to--

17:31.068 --> 17:32.310
No, Sharon.

17:32.448 --> 17:34.655
There's no one to go to.

17:34.793 --> 17:37.448
Don't you understand?
There's no one.

17:37.586 --> 17:40.517
Shit! What the...

17:40.655 --> 17:42.689
Just stay with Kareem, okay?

17:42.827 --> 17:45.137
What the hell is he gonna do?

17:45.275 --> 17:46.793
They don't like witnesses.

17:46.931 --> 17:48.344
So...

17:48.482 --> 17:50.965
And how do you know that?

17:51.103 --> 17:52.965
Just things Kyle told me.

17:53.103 --> 17:54.413
Of course.

17:54.551 --> 17:55.931
Just stay with him.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.068
- Wouldn't that put him in
danger too?

18:01.206 --> 18:04.413
- We'll be better if we all
stick together, honestly.

18:06.448 --> 18:07.896
God.

18:13.137 --> 18:16.793
- Did you enjoy your
late breakfast, sir?

18:16.931 --> 18:20.103
- Yeah, it was,
it was whatever.

18:20.241 --> 18:22.448
Could you, uh, could you get
me some coffee?

18:22.586 --> 18:24.310
Yes, sir.

18:50.517 --> 18:53.896
Sir, sir, what are you doing?

18:54.034 --> 18:59.758
- Um, um, I'm...
I'm going somewhere.

19:01.517 --> 19:03.586
Where are you going, sir?

19:03.724 --> 19:06.448
- Look,
if it's your job to follow me,

19:06.586 --> 19:09.103
then shut your little mouth
and do that.

19:09.241 --> 19:11.620
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.827
- Don't ask me any more
questions.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.551
- What are you doing?
Where are you going?

19:32.689 --> 19:34.241
- I'm going to jump off the
roof.

19:34.379 --> 19:35.896
Oh, okay.

19:36.034 --> 19:38.448
Well, be sure you hit something
hard when you land.

19:38.586 --> 19:40.551
Do you think I'm joking?

19:40.689 --> 19:44.448
- Jason, I really don't give a
shit.

19:44.586 --> 19:46.689
I hate you.

19:46.827 --> 19:49.931
- Well that's an emotion
I know very well.

19:50.068 --> 19:53.137
- You're the worst kind of
mother.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.241
I know.

19:55.379 --> 19:58.517
And I'm looking at the proof.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.379
Tell me before it's too late.

20:01.517 --> 20:03.551
Where is Gayle?

20:03.689 --> 20:05.655
Where you will be soon.

20:05.793 --> 20:08.827
What did you do to her?

20:08.965 --> 20:12.758
- She is getting the help
you both need.

20:12.896 --> 20:15.655
- You know why we need help,
Mom?

20:15.793 --> 20:19.827
- Yes, because
I'm an awful mother.

20:19.965 --> 20:24.724
- Yeah, and I hope you
can live with yourself.

20:24.862 --> 20:26.862
I'll die a happy woman.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.034
- You know, I'm tempted to
take you off of him

20:37.172 --> 20:39.068
and let him have free reign
of this place.

20:39.206 --> 20:41.517
- I'm not sure that's the best
idea, ma'am.

20:41.655 --> 20:43.310
- Well, then you better follow
him.

20:43.448 --> 20:45.000
Yes, ma'am.

20:52.344 --> 20:54.586
Hello, First Lady.

20:54.724 --> 20:57.862
Hi, Second Lady.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.344
How are you?

21:00.482 --> 21:02.482
I'm not doing too good.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.758
- Oh no.
What's the issue?

21:05.896 --> 21:09.620
- That husband of yours
is a bit of a Boy Scout.

21:09.758 --> 21:11.620
I'm sorry?

21:11.758 --> 21:13.241
He didn't tell you?

21:13.379 --> 21:17.241
- No. He asked me to come here
to meet with him.

21:17.379 --> 21:19.068
Did he now?

21:19.206 --> 21:21.724
Yes.

21:21.862 --> 21:23.517
Where are your children?

21:23.655 --> 21:24.931
They're at school.

21:25.068 --> 21:27.896
- At school?
- Mm-hmm.

21:28.034 --> 21:30.448
- And are they still
attending...

21:30.586 --> 21:33.551
- Franklin.
- That's beautiful.

21:33.689 --> 21:35.206
- Oh yes, it is.
And you know what?

21:35.344 --> 21:37.310
They really love it there.

21:37.448 --> 21:39.241
That's great.

21:39.379 --> 21:41.137
And how are your children?

21:41.275 --> 21:43.448
Oh, they're wonderful.

21:43.586 --> 21:46.793
Doing much better than yours,
I'm sure.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.000
Hmm.

21:49.137 --> 21:52.620
Well, I'm sorry, but I really
need to go and meet

21:52.758 --> 21:54.172
with my husband.,

21:54.310 --> 21:57.448
- Can I tell you something?
- Oh, of course.

21:57.586 --> 21:59.482
Please.

22:06.413 --> 22:08.241
I don't like you.

22:08.379 --> 22:11.586
I don't like him.

22:11.724 --> 22:14.827
You have the worst taste in
clothes,

22:14.965 --> 22:18.724
and now you're wearing this?

22:20.827 --> 22:24.103
- Yes, I thought that it's--

22:24.241 --> 22:26.551
Beautiful.

22:26.689 --> 22:30.551
Well, thank you.

22:30.689 --> 22:32.827
- Don't ever come here to
the White House

22:32.965 --> 22:36.137
trying to look better than me.
Are we clear?

22:36.275 --> 22:38.275
- That's not what I was trying
to do.

22:38.413 --> 22:40.896
- No, that's what you were
trying to do.

22:41.034 --> 22:44.172
- Now, why would I want to
do that?

22:44.310 --> 22:47.241
Don't question me.

22:47.379 --> 22:49.862
Well, I'm sorry.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.068
Truly.

22:52.206 --> 22:55.586
- So you were on your way to
see your husband?

22:55.724 --> 22:57.241
Yes.

22:57.379 --> 23:01.551
And I'm running late, so
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get there.

23:01.689 --> 23:03.689
No, no, no, no, no.

23:03.827 --> 23:06.172
You're having lunch with me.

23:06.310 --> 23:11.620
- I don't--
- That wasn't a question, dear.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.862
Okay.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.586
Um, I just need to tell
my husband before we go.

23:17.724 --> 23:20.275
- No, no, no.
You'll tell him nothing.

23:23.862 --> 23:25.827
Where's your detail, darling?

23:25.965 --> 23:27.379
At the bottom of the stairs.

23:27.517 --> 23:30.620
And I don't have my phone,
I think I should--

23:30.758 --> 23:32.655
- I'll be sure the staff
tells him.

23:35.586 --> 23:37.275
Yes, ma'am.

23:46.068 --> 23:48.586
- Did that little bastard
eat it all?

23:48.724 --> 23:50.068
Priscilla...

23:50.206 --> 23:53.241
What?

23:53.379 --> 23:56.551
- It is obvious you're
not happy working here.

23:56.689 --> 23:58.551
I'm happy here.

23:58.689 --> 24:01.413
- Well, you're not acting like
it.

24:01.551 --> 24:05.379
I'm not happy with her.

24:05.517 --> 24:11.103
- Well, you have to work
for her, or you can leave.

24:15.448 --> 24:18.206
I can work for her.

24:18.344 --> 24:23.206
- Then I need you to return to
the professional that you are.

24:24.827 --> 24:26.862
- I'm trying, Richard.
- Yeah, well...

24:27.000 --> 24:29.413
It doesn't look like it.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.827
It's hard.

24:30.965 --> 24:32.482
You know what I'm going
through.

24:32.620 --> 24:33.965
Then take some time off.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.034
- I don't want to take any
time off.

24:36.172 --> 24:37.586
- Priscilla, it may be for the
best.

24:37.724 --> 24:41.517
It's not gonna happen.

24:41.655 --> 24:46.379
- I'm surprised you're even
still working here.

24:46.517 --> 24:47.793
She can't fire me.

24:47.931 --> 24:49.103
- Yeah, 'cause you played a
card

24:49.241 --> 24:53.551
that we were never ever to
play.

24:53.689 --> 24:59.344
I know, I'll do better.

24:59.482 --> 25:00.724
Have you talked to Sam?

25:00.862 --> 25:02.413
About what?

25:02.551 --> 25:04.000
Anything.

25:04.137 --> 25:05.517
Are y'all talking?

25:05.655 --> 25:07.448
Are you and Nancy talking?

25:07.586 --> 25:09.344
Yes, we are.

25:09.482 --> 25:10.931
Well, good.

25:11.068 --> 25:12.620
And you need to talk to Sam.

25:12.758 --> 25:15.379
No, Richard.

25:15.517 --> 25:16.965
Priscilla...

25:17.103 --> 25:18.896
- What Nancy did was 25
years ago.

25:19.034 --> 25:20.827
Sam just did it.

25:20.965 --> 25:22.758
Okay, okay.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.586
- I'm not talking to him.
We're done.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.206
Okay.

25:26.344 --> 25:29.068
- You want me to be better?
Stop bringing his ass up.

25:29.206 --> 25:32.551
- Okay.
- Thank you.

25:32.689 --> 25:34.793
Sure.

25:40.620 --> 25:43.758
- You want me to take that
stuff to the downstairs kitchen?

25:43.896 --> 25:47.034
No. I'll take care of it.

25:47.172 --> 25:50.344
- Great, I'll prepare the lunch.
- Yeah.

25:55.448 --> 25:56.862
Enter.

25:58.862 --> 26:00.689
Sir...

26:00.827 --> 26:02.413
Sam.

26:02.551 --> 26:04.965
How are you, sir?

26:05.103 --> 26:07.034
I'm not so sure.

26:15.344 --> 26:18.137
- Is there something I can do
for you, sir?

26:18.275 --> 26:20.793
I'm told I can trust you.

26:20.931 --> 26:22.931
Yes sir, you can.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.551
- The President killed a woman,
framed two agents,

26:28.689 --> 26:33.482
and then killed the maid.
What do you know about this?

26:33.620 --> 26:38.034
Uh, well, sir, I, uh...

26:38.172 --> 26:42.482
- This is not
the time to be coy.

26:42.620 --> 26:44.689
I've heard rumors.

26:44.827 --> 26:46.931
Rumors?

26:50.965 --> 26:53.655
Bobby says you're with us.

26:53.793 --> 26:55.310
Yes, sir.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.379
He and Max.

26:57.517 --> 27:00.103
- So you are working with
them, sir?

27:00.241 --> 27:03.793
They are true patriots.

27:03.931 --> 27:06.655
Yes, yes they are.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.344
So are you with me?

27:12.517 --> 27:14.827
Yes sir, I am.

27:14.965 --> 27:18.344
Then tell me what you know.

27:18.482 --> 27:21.586
Yes, sir.

27:21.724 --> 27:24.103
I think the Chief of Staff
is in on it--

27:24.241 --> 27:26.241
the cover-up, that is.

27:26.379 --> 27:29.448
And forgive me for saying,
but

27:29.586 --> 27:32.310
the First Son has serious
issues.

27:32.448 --> 27:34.517
I see.

27:34.655 --> 27:36.275
Yes, sir.

27:36.413 --> 27:39.793
Well,

27:39.931 --> 27:44.413
I'm about to go public,
and I just need a few good men

27:44.551 --> 27:45.758
to stand with me.

27:45.896 --> 27:47.758
Yes, sir.

27:47.896 --> 27:49.344
Can I count on you?

27:49.482 --> 27:53.793
- Well, sir, if I may ask,
um...

27:53.931 --> 27:56.931
That's why you're here.

27:57.068 --> 27:59.034
How solid is your case?

27:59.172 --> 28:02.896
- Well, with more and more
people like you,

28:03.034 --> 28:07.275
I should have enough information
to take it to the Senate.

28:07.413 --> 28:09.758
His party rules, sir.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.965
They can't rule away evidence.

28:12.103 --> 28:13.827
- Sir, they are rather, um,
cult-like

28:13.965 --> 28:16.758
in their following for him.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.344
- What would you have me
do, hmm?

28:19.482 --> 28:22.517
Let the President of the United
States get away with murder?

28:22.655 --> 28:23.896
No, sir.

28:24.034 --> 28:27.793
- No, I won't do it.
I won't.

28:27.931 --> 28:29.689
Yes, sir.

28:29.827 --> 28:32.275
- You know her father
almost had him killed?

28:32.413 --> 28:34.241
- Well, sir...

28:34.379 --> 28:36.448
We don't know that to be true.

28:36.586 --> 28:39.724
- I know it.
I absolutely know it.

28:39.862 --> 28:41.275
Yes, sir.

28:41.413 --> 28:44.137
- Look, I know you can't be
my detail leader,

28:44.275 --> 28:47.310
but I just need you to keep
an eye on my wife and me

28:47.448 --> 28:49.206
until Max and Bobby get here.

28:49.344 --> 28:50.620
They're coming here, sir?

28:50.758 --> 28:54.413
- Yes, and then I'm going to
the briefing room

28:54.551 --> 28:57.896
to tell the press what I know.

28:58.034 --> 29:02.241
- Sir, I'm not sure
that's the best thing to do.

29:02.379 --> 29:04.310
The people need to know.

29:04.448 --> 29:08.310
Sir, are you sure?

29:08.448 --> 29:12.275
Yes, just please...

29:12.413 --> 29:14.344
I don't trust my detail.

29:14.482 --> 29:17.137
- I have a few other men
that I can put on you, sir.

29:17.275 --> 29:19.724
- No, actually I would rather
you send them to the school

29:19.862 --> 29:22.448
to pick up my children and
take them to a secure location.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.758
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, thank you.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.379
Yes, sir.

29:38.034 --> 29:40.034
- Hello.
- Hey.

29:40.172 --> 29:41.620
Hey.

29:41.758 --> 29:44.482
I was just at the store getting
your favorites.

29:44.620 --> 29:46.034
Thank you.

29:46.172 --> 29:50.586
- Richard, thank you
so much for forgiving me.

29:50.724 --> 29:53.517
- Baby, I don't want to talk
about that right now.

29:53.655 --> 29:55.310
- Don't tell me you're still
mad.

29:55.448 --> 29:57.586
- No, no, no, no,
no, I'm not mad.

29:57.724 --> 29:59.482
Okay, good.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.724
- But I do need you to
swing by the White House.

30:02.862 --> 30:04.241
Oh, okay.

30:04.379 --> 30:06.689
Uh, you need something?

30:06.827 --> 30:09.137
- I need you to talk to
Priscilla.

30:09.275 --> 30:12.896
- Oh, okay.
Uh, is she okay?

30:13.034 --> 30:16.551
No. No, no, she's not.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.413
- Well, I'll come by.
- Okay.

30:18.551 --> 30:21.586
Yeah, she just needs somebody
to talk to.

30:21.724 --> 30:25.620
- Are you sure that's the best
place to do it?

30:25.758 --> 30:27.206
Why wouldn't it be?

30:27.344 --> 30:30.689
- I mean, isn't that the place
of all the pain?

30:30.827 --> 30:32.172
You know about that?

30:32.310 --> 30:36.724
- She's told me enough and
I put the rest together.

30:36.862 --> 30:42.137
- Shit, I wish she wouldn't
have done that.

30:42.275 --> 30:45.137
- So you're asking me
to come by and help,

30:45.275 --> 30:47.379
but you don't want me
to know the truth?

30:47.517 --> 30:51.103
- Okay, okay,
I get it, I get it.

30:51.241 --> 30:56.931
- I mean, you know--you know I
know how to keep secrets, so...

30:57.068 --> 31:00.413
Nancy...

31:00.551 --> 31:03.793
- I--I didn't mean that.

31:03.931 --> 31:06.517
Look, now, it's too soon to
be making that kind of a joke.

31:06.655 --> 31:09.896
- No, I wasn't.

31:10.034 --> 31:13.517
I'm sorry.

31:13.655 --> 31:17.103
- Yeah, I do know you know
how to keep a secret.

31:17.241 --> 31:19.103
Richard, I'm sorry.

31:19.241 --> 31:20.310
Look, I gotta go.

31:20.448 --> 31:23.586
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

31:23.724 --> 31:26.724
- Look, just call me
when you want me to come by.

31:26.862 --> 31:30.517
- Yeah, I will.
- I'm sorry again.

31:30.655 --> 31:34.896
- It's alright.
I'll call you.

31:35.034 --> 31:36.758
Okay.

31:40.137 --> 31:41.586
Damn!

31:49.482 --> 31:51.137
- Who is it?

31:51.275 --> 31:53.241
It's Alonzo.

32:06.310 --> 32:07.758
Hey, man.

32:07.896 --> 32:09.758
Sorry, but that -- kid is
insane.

32:09.896 --> 32:11.344
Alonzo...

32:11.482 --> 32:13.896
- They had me watching him
every goddamn second.

32:14.034 --> 32:16.586
They thought he was gonna
do something stupid.

32:16.724 --> 32:18.689
I just got off and I
came straight over here.

32:18.827 --> 32:20.827
- Alonzo...
- So, look I got the Glock--

32:20.965 --> 32:26.034
Look, man, look around.

32:26.172 --> 32:27.862
What the hell happened?

32:28.000 --> 32:30.241
She's dead.

32:30.379 --> 32:33.862
- Who's--
- Ellie, she's dead.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.482
What?

32:35.620 --> 32:40.206
- They shot her right in
there.

32:40.344 --> 32:41.862
What?

32:42.000 --> 32:45.448
- They said it was a stray
bullet.

32:45.586 --> 32:48.586
What are you saying?

32:48.724 --> 32:50.413
- That's exactly what I'm
saying.

32:50.551 --> 32:53.896
She's dead.
We were in there talking.

32:54.034 --> 32:55.655
And just like that, a bullet--

32:55.793 --> 32:58.586
- What? What the hell?
- Look, man--

32:58.724 --> 33:01.137
- When did this happen?
- I need that gun, okay?

33:01.275 --> 33:06.034
- No, no, you're not taking this
gun.

33:06.172 --> 33:08.137
- I need the gun.
- For what?

33:08.275 --> 33:09.724
What are you going to do
with it?

33:09.862 --> 33:13.655
- They did it, man.
Okay?

33:13.793 --> 33:17.206
- Allan, you're not making
any sense.

33:17.344 --> 33:19.482
- They did it.
You hear me?

33:19.620 --> 33:22.586
The White House, okay?
She did it.

33:28.517 --> 33:30.482
I think the First Lady had
her killed.

33:33.620 --> 33:36.758
- Allan, are you okay?
- Look, man, I'm telling you--

33:36.896 --> 33:40.000
- No, you're not telling
me this.

33:40.137 --> 33:44.206
She did it. Okay?

33:44.344 --> 33:47.275
The First Lady did it.

33:47.413 --> 33:49.172
Allan...

33:49.310 --> 33:51.413
Okay, you're obviously upset.

33:51.551 --> 33:54.241
I'm not upset!

33:54.379 --> 33:56.413
Alonzo, I'm telling you the
truth.

33:56.551 --> 33:58.965
- No, you're not telling me
the truth.

33:59.103 --> 34:02.448
- What you're saying, it's--
- Is what? What is it?

34:02.586 --> 34:04.413
It's madness.

34:04.551 --> 34:05.931
Oh God...

34:07.310 --> 34:10.206
Okay, look...

34:10.344 --> 34:13.689
I know she did it.

34:13.827 --> 34:18.448
She wanted me to
beat Ellie with a bat

34:18.586 --> 34:20.275
in the -- head.

34:20.413 --> 34:24.586
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:24.724 --> 34:27.724
- Okay, I'm gonna go now,
alright?

34:27.862 --> 34:30.620
- I need that gun, man.
Okay? Please.

34:30.758 --> 34:32.862
- No, no.
You're not taking this gun.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.275
- I need it, I need the gun.
Please.

34:37.413 --> 34:38.793
Don't make me beg you, man.

34:38.931 --> 34:42.517
Allan, don't make me pin you.

34:44.793 --> 34:47.793
Okay.

34:47.931 --> 34:49.655
Okay.

34:51.551 --> 34:54.137
You need help.

34:54.275 --> 34:56.137
Don't talk to me
until you get it.

34:56.275 --> 34:58.862
- Don't do this to me.
You're all I got right now.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.620
- Don't--
- Please.

35:00.758 --> 35:04.241
- Don't come to the White
House with this bullshit,

35:04.379 --> 35:07.275
or I swear I will let them know.

35:07.413 --> 35:09.379
I will do my job.

35:37.931 --> 35:43.482
- Ahhh.
- Ahhh.

35:43.620 --> 35:48.655
- Come on, come on, girl.

35:48.793 --> 35:54.413
- Kyle, I don't know anything,
Kyle.

35:54.551 --> 35:56.827
- You're a lot tougher than
I thought.

35:56.965 --> 35:58.206
Please.

35:58.344 --> 36:01.586
- No, no, no.
No please, Lilly!

36:05.793 --> 36:10.137
- Look, Kyle, I swear
I don't know anything, okay?

36:10.275 --> 36:13.275
- I think you know everything.
- No, I don't.

36:13.413 --> 36:18.206
I really don't, I really don't.

36:18.344 --> 36:21.310
Okay, well, more water.

36:21.448 --> 36:25.448
- --.
- Then tell me, Lilly.

36:25.586 --> 36:27.724
Come on, girl.

36:27.862 --> 36:30.724
Kyle, Kyle, please.

36:30.862 --> 36:32.793
I don't know anything.

36:32.931 --> 36:34.655
- I don't, I swear I don't.
- My gosh,

36:34.793 --> 36:37.172
you make this so hard on
yourself.

36:40.758 --> 36:43.724
Yeah, come in.

36:43.862 --> 36:45.310
- Sir.
- Hey.

36:45.448 --> 36:46.896
I was told you wanted to
see me.

36:47.034 --> 36:50.413
- Yes, sir.
- What is it?

36:50.551 --> 36:52.206
This can't wait.

36:54.620 --> 36:56.620
Tell me.

36:56.758 --> 37:00.068
- May I sit down, sir?
- This must be serious.

37:00.206 --> 37:01.827
Yes, it is.

37:04.172 --> 37:07.103
- Is this about
the Vice President, Sam?

37:07.241 --> 37:08.758
Sir?

37:08.896 --> 37:13.137
- Well, I was told that you
went to his office to see him.

37:13.275 --> 37:14.896
Yes, sir.

37:17.448 --> 37:22.137
- And what did you need to
talk to him about, Sam?

37:22.275 --> 37:26.827
- His kids, they were fond of
me on the campaign trail, sir.

37:26.965 --> 37:31.517
- Well, I didn't know you were
with them.

37:31.655 --> 37:33.931
- In the distance.
- Yeah.

37:34.068 --> 37:36.206
You know, if I asked him,
he'd probably say

37:36.344 --> 37:38.655
the same thing, right?

37:38.793 --> 37:41.793
- Yes sir, I'm sure he would.
- Yeah.

37:41.931 --> 37:43.793
So that's what you went to
talk to him about?

37:43.931 --> 37:46.448
- Your kids?
- His kids, sir.

37:46.586 --> 37:49.620
Right, sorry, his, his kids.

37:49.758 --> 37:53.793
- Yes.
- Well...

37:53.931 --> 37:56.000
What do you want to talk
to me about, Sam?

37:56.137 --> 38:01.482
- Well, sir, uh,
this is really sensitive.

38:01.620 --> 38:02.965
Okay.

38:03.103 --> 38:05.241
It's about the President.

38:05.379 --> 38:07.000
What?

38:07.137 --> 38:10.137
- I am friends with the family
of someone who claims

38:10.275 --> 38:12.724
she was brought here to
the White House to meet

38:12.862 --> 38:14.827
with the President.

38:14.965 --> 38:18.620
What are you saying, Sam?

38:18.758 --> 38:22.103
- I'm saying Agent Kyle went
to a pharmacy, picked her up,

38:22.241 --> 38:26.103
and brought her here to
meet with the President, sir.

38:26.241 --> 38:30.862
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.793
- And this girl, she's
a friend of yours right?

38:35.931 --> 38:39.689
- No sir, she knows
a family that I know.

38:39.827 --> 38:42.206
And who are they?

38:42.344 --> 38:44.758
I'd rather not say.

38:44.896 --> 38:47.965
- You don't trust much
very well, do you Sam?

38:48.103 --> 38:51.206
- Sir,
I'm just trying to do my job.

38:51.344 --> 38:52.655
- Yeah.
- And at the same time,

38:52.793 --> 38:54.068
look out for all of us.

38:54.206 --> 38:58.137
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
sorry.

38:58.275 --> 39:01.275
Well, Sam, I can assure you
that that never happened.

39:01.413 --> 39:04.551
Otherwise I'd know about it,
right?

39:04.689 --> 39:06.137
Yes, sir.

39:06.275 --> 39:10.241
- I mean, is it in
any of your books?

39:10.379 --> 39:13.137
- No, it's not, sir.
- Boom!

39:13.275 --> 39:18.965
- Didn't happen, right?
- Except that she says it did.

39:19.103 --> 39:22.275
- Oh, so you had a conversation
with this girl?

39:22.413 --> 39:25.517
- No, but my source
informed me that--

39:25.655 --> 39:27.862
- So what you're telling me
is hearsay bullshit,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.965
- sources and all?
- Sir, I'm just trying--

39:31.103 --> 39:34.000
- To not tell me
one damn thing, Sam.

39:34.137 --> 39:37.620
- Not one.
- I'm sorry, sir?

39:37.758 --> 39:40.931
- What would you have me do,
Sam, hmm?

39:41.068 --> 39:43.620
- Maybe talk to the President.
- Yeah? Well--

39:43.758 --> 39:46.310
- Let him know that's not
a good idea.

39:46.448 --> 39:49.620
- Maybe I'll get you to do
that, huh?

39:49.758 --> 39:51.379
He's not fond of me, sir.

39:51.517 --> 39:52.862
Yeah, I'm aware.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.482
First Lady's
.

39:54.620 --> 39:58.172
So maybe you should.

39:58.310 --> 40:02.517
- You know what?
I think I will.

40:02.655 --> 40:05.827
Thank you, sir.

40:05.965 --> 40:08.310
Will that be all?

40:08.448 --> 40:10.827
Yes, sir.

40:10.965 --> 40:14.482
And the Vice President?

40:14.620 --> 40:16.620
Yes, sir.

40:16.758 --> 40:20.206
His, his kids, right?

40:20.344 --> 40:21.689
- Yes, sir.
Did I say something wrong?

40:21.827 --> 40:24.310
No, no. Not at all.

40:24.448 --> 40:25.896
Just...

40:27.310 --> 40:29.931
- Very well, sir.
Thank you.

40:35.379 --> 40:38.827
- I don't trust your ass, Sam.
I don't trust your ass.

40:46.448 --> 40:48.344
Sorry about that.

41:02.103 --> 41:03.586
Go on, I'll cover.

41:31.034 --> 41:32.862
Cover me!

41:38.034 --> 41:39.586
Come on!

41:43.655 --> 41:46.413
Next on The Oval...

41:48.000 --> 41:49.448
I need backup.

41:49.586 --> 41:52.758
- Did you have a girl in the
White House?

41:52.896 --> 41:54.379
A girl?

41:54.517 --> 41:56.827
- A girl that works at a
pharmacy, sir.

41:56.965 --> 41:58.172
What are you two up to?

41:58.310 --> 42:01.344
- Sorry, I really don't--
- Cut the shit!

42:01.482 --> 42:03.620
See, this is why I don't like
talking to you.

42:03.758 --> 42:05.551
You're so damn fake.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.137
- These agents uncovered
evidence which links

42:07.275 --> 42:09.103
the White House to these
crimes.

42:09.241 --> 42:10.689
That son of a bitch.

42:10.827 --> 42:13.413
- We believe it to be the
President and First Lady.
