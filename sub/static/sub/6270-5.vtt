<i>Previously on Witches of East End...</i>

00:01.612 --> 00:03.828
- Your brother got a job at the bar today.
- What?

00:03.828 --> 00:05.246
I was engaged
once before.

00:05.281 --> 00:07.105
Killian slept with her
three months before our wedding,

00:07.106 --> 00:09.063
and that was pretty much
the last time I saw my brother.

00:09.064 --> 00:12.412
Joanna Beauchamp? How could you sit
here as if everything is normal?

00:12.429 --> 00:14.063
I watched you kill my husband.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.732
- Shut up.
- What just happened to her?

00:16.767 --> 00:19.468
<i>Revive papilio.</i>

00:21.655 --> 00:23.973
Who's the shifter?

00:24.007 --> 00:27.371
Trying to find out who's gonna die
because of the curse that you unleashed.

00:39.423 --> 00:40.656
Adam!

00:47.142 --> 00:49.165
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:51.045 --> 00:52.301
What's up?

00:52.335 --> 00:54.887
It's Adam's funeral today.

00:55.602 --> 00:56.939
I know.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.275
And I thought maybe
I could go with you?

00:59.309 --> 01:02.311
I know how much he meant
to you and how you...

01:02.345 --> 01:05.346
- Are probably blaming yourself.
- It's fine.

01:05.364 --> 01:08.367
I'm okay. I'm actually not
going to the funeral.

01:08.368 --> 01:09.986
What do you mean? Why not?

01:10.384 --> 01:14.180
I did love Adam, obviously,
or he wouldn't have died.

01:14.195 --> 01:16.720
Ingrid... It's not your fault.

01:16.721 --> 01:20.961
But we weren't dating that long, and
I don't want to play the grieving widow.

01:20.962 --> 01:23.752
His funeral should be
a family thing.

01:23.781 --> 01:25.983
I wouldn't feel right.

01:26.468 --> 01:28.343
Okay.

01:28.741 --> 01:31.742
Then maybe you and I can
do something to remember him;

01:31.760 --> 01:34.045
a little ritual to say good-bye.

01:34.096 --> 01:37.682
It's okay, Wendy. I just
want to be alone right now.

01:37.716 --> 01:41.085
Honey, there's no shame in
leaning on people who love you.

01:41.103 --> 01:43.771
Just let me do this my own way.

01:44.274 --> 01:46.492
Please, Wendy?

02:01.264 --> 02:02.881
Mm, hey.

02:04.293 --> 02:05.609
Hey.

02:16.674 --> 02:19.659
It really is breathtaking,
don't you think?

02:19.677 --> 02:22.495
It's beautiful. I can't believe
they found this.

02:22.496 --> 02:25.080
- What's going on?
- Oh... go away.

02:25.081 --> 02:26.894
It's bad luck to see the dress
before the wedding day.

02:26.895 --> 02:28.196
You got a dress?

02:28.197 --> 02:32.127
Well, some workmen found the most
beautiful antique wedding gown yesterday,

02:32.128 --> 02:34.096
when they were working
on the east wing.

02:34.097 --> 02:36.809
I can't believe I'm actually gonna
live in a house with wings.

02:36.810 --> 02:39.898
And the dress is perfect.
It's so much better

02:39.899 --> 02:43.274
than that tacky thing that Elyse was
gonna wear at Dash's first wedding.

02:43.275 --> 02:47.137
Anyway, got lots to do.
See you later, dears.

02:48.096 --> 02:49.322
I'm so sorry.

02:49.323 --> 02:52.923
It's fine. We're actually making
progress, believe it or not, but, still,

02:52.924 --> 02:55.725
she never misses a chance to remind me
that you've been engaged before.

02:55.726 --> 02:58.254
Well, maybe it's just because she's
so happy you're the one I'm with now.

02:58.255 --> 03:01.419
I think she'd be happier if a barmaid
wasn't moving into her house.

03:01.437 --> 03:05.274
But that's just too damn bad,
because I'm not going anywhere.

03:05.308 --> 03:08.060
- Mmm. You better not.
- Mm-mm.

03:08.621 --> 03:12.931
- Now get out of here.
- All right.

03:15.401 --> 03:17.035
Jo.

03:17.566 --> 03:20.739
- Hey, Jo.
- Hey.

03:20.773 --> 03:22.875
Wow, that's beautiful.

03:23.383 --> 03:25.585
We gotta be in court in ten minutes.
Let's go.

03:25.586 --> 03:27.408
It's just so surreal.

03:27.409 --> 03:29.727
I'm charged with a murder
I didn't commit

03:29.730 --> 03:32.539
and committed a murder
that no one knows about.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.934
You did what you had to do.
You owned your power.

03:34.935 --> 03:37.934
You stood up for your family.
You were the best version of yourself.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.131
Seeing that just made me
love you more.

03:40.556 --> 03:43.040
How much of what you say
to me is bullshit?

03:43.058 --> 03:45.009
And how much
is actually sincere?

03:45.043 --> 03:48.563
Why would I bullshit you? Seriously?
It hasn't worked for 200 years.

03:48.597 --> 03:51.766
I wouldn't bother anymore
if it wasn't the truth.

03:53.568 --> 03:55.360
Thank you, Harrison.

03:56.738 --> 03:59.985
All right, let's go do this.

04:01.402 --> 04:03.436
Okay...

04:05.607 --> 04:10.234
Hey, Ingrid. It's me. Again.
I'm just checking on you.

04:10.252 --> 04:12.069
I know you said
you want to be alone,

04:12.087 --> 04:14.405
but I just want you to know
that I'm thinking of you.

04:14.423 --> 04:17.241
Call me if you need me.
I love you.

04:17.259 --> 04:21.392
I can feel you
undressing me with your eyes.

04:21.394 --> 04:24.294
No, I was dressing you
even more

04:24.302 --> 04:26.883
with protective gloves, you know?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.184
Safety first?

04:28.218 --> 04:30.186
I like that you care
about my safety.

04:30.220 --> 04:32.525
No more so than the safety
of any other coworker.

04:32.526 --> 04:35.433
But you're here on your day off,
which must mean you missed me.

04:35.434 --> 04:37.559
Or else it's payday.
Where's Roger?

04:37.577 --> 04:39.916
- Not in yet.
- All right, I'll wait.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.334
Can I get you a drink?

04:51.358 --> 04:53.530
No. Thank you.

04:53.983 --> 04:55.845
Actually, um...

04:55.879 --> 04:58.631
You and the bartender,
are you guys...?

04:58.682 --> 05:01.600
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm engaged to his brother.

05:02.686 --> 05:08.257
Wow. I guess... Dash's tastes
have changed.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.156
I'm sorry. Who
are you exactly?

05:12.157 --> 05:16.561
I'm Elyse.
I was engaged to Dash, too.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.704
I'm just kidding.

05:21.771 --> 05:25.232
Oh, man... you know, I feel
like I haven't eaten in days.

05:25.233 --> 05:28.304
I should be starving, but
I-I'm not really hungry at all.

05:28.320 --> 05:32.948
- What-what time is it, anyway?
- Uh, like, noon, I guess?

05:32.966 --> 05:35.384
I can't find my phone.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.470
- Are you going somewhere?
- Sadly, yeah.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.889
I need to get back
to work, you know?

05:40.915 --> 05:44.051
- I took the last three days off.
- So take one more.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.294
That's what I'm doing.

05:51.346 --> 05:53.880
Weird how that keeps happening.

05:53.881 --> 05:56.305
I guess
we're an electric combination.

05:56.915 --> 05:58.923
No doubt about that.

06:00.176 --> 06:05.080
Mrs. Thatcher, could you walk us
through the night of your husband's death

06:05.115 --> 06:06.582
as you remember it?

06:06.616 --> 06:09.534
Well, we were
in the park,

06:09.535 --> 06:11.587
taking the dog
for a walk.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.979
And it was dark.

06:14.858 --> 06:16.258
And...

06:20.182 --> 06:23.584
I don't actually remember
what happened.

06:24.569 --> 06:27.960
Mrs. Thatcher, you gave
a detailed account to the police.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.590
So, uh, could you
try to recall...

06:29.591 --> 06:31.821
Your Honor, I appreciate
the prosecutor's assistance,

06:31.822 --> 06:34.583
but if I thought he was qualified to be
a member of the defense team,

06:34.584 --> 06:36.111
I would've hired him by now.

06:36.112 --> 06:39.332
This is the defense's cross.
Don't interrupt again.

06:40.448 --> 06:42.047
Thank you, your Honor.

06:43.245 --> 06:45.020
For the record, Mrs. Thatcher,

06:45.055 --> 06:49.011
can you, with complete certainty,
identify your husband's killer?

06:49.316 --> 06:51.126
Well, I'm not sure.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.065
It was so dark.
And foggy.

06:54.066 --> 06:57.269
- Mm-hmm.
- And I heard a lot of screaming...

06:59.369 --> 07:03.789
...But I didn't actually see
who killed my husband.

07:25.691 --> 07:29.031
Adam, you can stay here.

07:29.575 --> 07:32.544
I promise no one's expecting you
to show up for work today.

07:32.545 --> 07:34.625
I-I'm pretty sure they are.

07:35.071 --> 07:38.157
Listen, these last
few days have...

07:38.408 --> 07:40.843
Been kind of the best
of my life.

07:41.287 --> 07:46.932
But I do have to get back
to my life.

07:47.833 --> 07:50.879
Oh, God.
O-okay, Adam...

07:51.348 --> 07:55.018
Please try to hear this
with an open mind.

07:56.541 --> 08:00.217
No one is expecting you
at work today,

08:00.218 --> 08:03.047
because they're at your funeral.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.739
You have a very strange
sense of humor.

08:10.773 --> 08:14.209
Think back
to a couple of days ago...

08:14.244 --> 08:16.605
- Mm-hmm.
- At the hospital.

08:16.606 --> 08:19.107
You collapsed.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.518
You had an aneurysm.

08:23.623 --> 08:25.734
And you died.

08:33.178 --> 08:35.898
- B-but I'm-I'm here.
- Uh-huh.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.299
I can't be dead. I... um...

08:38.318 --> 08:41.039
That's-that's im...
Im...

08:45.588 --> 08:50.579
You are here, yes, but you're more
like a conscious apparition than a...

08:50.613 --> 08:53.140
Flesh and blood person.

08:53.148 --> 08:55.471
Really? 'Cause that looks
like a lot of blood, Ingrid.

08:55.487 --> 08:57.786
It's okay, it's okay.
I know what you're seeing.

08:57.820 --> 08:59.744
This is a totally normal
part of the process.

08:59.745 --> 09:01.541
What process?
What are you talking about?

09:01.542 --> 09:06.434
Where you process your new reality.
I've read all about this. I can fix it.

09:06.450 --> 09:09.014
<i>Restituo perspicientia.</i>

09:09.048 --> 09:11.683
<i>Restituo perspicientia.</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:16.305
<i>Restituo perspicientia.</i>

09:19.943 --> 09:22.191
There.

09:23.423 --> 09:25.531
- What the hell are you?
- Adam...

09:26.846 --> 09:29.266
Get away from me.

09:38.727 --> 09:41.703
Dash, hey, it's me... I know
you're busy at the hospital

09:41.704 --> 09:44.423
and this is, like, my ninth call,
but please call me back.

09:44.443 --> 09:46.528
I really need to talk to you.

09:48.907 --> 09:50.495
Hey, what do you think?

09:50.529 --> 09:53.650
- What?
- Where did you get that dress?

09:54.792 --> 09:55.992
Ingrid!

09:57.345 --> 09:58.936
Some workmen found it
at Fair Haven.

10:00.047 --> 10:01.794
Oh, my Go...

10:01.795 --> 10:03.810
Why would you do that?
I liked this dress.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.853
- It was your sister's.
- Ingrid's?!

10:05.854 --> 10:08.735
She was getting married a long time ago.
I don't want to talk about it.

10:08.736 --> 10:10.827
Oh, my God. You have to
give me more than that.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.727
That dress has bad karma.

10:12.728 --> 10:16.676
Oh, this...
This family is crazy.

10:16.677 --> 10:20.033
Okay, what is wrong with you?
Your aura is all over the place.

10:20.059 --> 10:23.937
'Cause I'm freaking out.
Dash's old fiancée is in town.

10:23.938 --> 10:26.840
Okay. And you're worried
about her and Dash?

10:26.874 --> 10:28.974
No, of course not.

10:31.355 --> 10:34.168
Okay, fine. Maybe.
But sometimes I just wonder,

10:34.169 --> 10:37.146
if she hadn't cheated on him with Killian,
maybe they would still be together.

10:37.147 --> 10:38.953
Yeah? Well, I've read that boy,

10:38.954 --> 10:42.227
and if there's one thing I'm sure of,
he is madly in love with you.

10:42.228 --> 10:44.796
- I know. I just...
- You want to hear it from him.

10:44.797 --> 10:46.264
- Yeah.
- I get it.

10:46.265 --> 10:48.985
So, go talk to him,
and tell that bitch to back off,

10:48.986 --> 10:51.454
'cause I have claws,
and I ain't afraid to use 'em.

10:51.455 --> 10:53.356
We're gonna talk
about that wedding dress.

10:56.822 --> 11:01.964
All rise! This Court is now in session.
The Honorable Judge Pilgrim presides.

11:07.447 --> 11:10.670
I have determined that,
in the light of today's events,

11:10.677 --> 11:14.146
I am disallowing Maura Thatcher
as a witness for the prosecution.

11:14.219 --> 11:16.530
And given the State has
no other witnesses,

11:16.531 --> 11:20.697
no motive, and no physical evidence
to implicate Joanna Beauchamp

11:20.715 --> 11:22.436
in the murder
of William Thatcher,

11:22.437 --> 11:25.943
I hereby grant the
defense's motion for dismissal.

11:26.037 --> 11:28.307
Enjoy the rest of your day.

11:32.488 --> 11:35.626
- Does that mean...?
- That your lawyer's a total stud?

11:35.627 --> 11:38.148
It does indeed.
You're free.

11:42.126 --> 11:44.923
Oh, I cannot thank you enough.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.495
- You are...
- "Are the best?"

11:47.526 --> 11:49.243
Yeah, I know.

11:49.646 --> 11:52.031
Doesn't it seem
a little bit off, though?

11:52.032 --> 11:54.645
I mean, it's awfully convenient
that she just forgets

11:54.646 --> 11:56.609
that she saw me murder
her husband. It...

11:56.610 --> 11:58.613
You're a free
woman, Joanna.

11:58.752 --> 12:02.221
Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth,
and let's not talk about this here, okay?

12:02.255 --> 12:04.973
So, what do you say we
have some champagne?

12:24.334 --> 12:26.228
I can't believe it.

12:26.246 --> 12:30.249
My life is... is over.

12:30.618 --> 12:33.036
It doesn't have to be over.

12:34.704 --> 12:39.174
You said these last few days with me
have been the best you've ever had.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.629
They've been the best
I've ever had, too.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.718
But... but I'm dead.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.937
Everyone has problems.

12:55.809 --> 13:00.028
How did this happen, anyway?
I mean, how-how am I even here?

13:00.063 --> 13:01.856
I conjured your spirit.

13:01.857 --> 13:04.106
- But how?
- I used a spell.

13:04.525 --> 13:07.777
- I'm a witch.
- Come on, Ingrid. I...

13:07.778 --> 13:12.247
You're a ghost. I don't really think
you're in a position to judge.

13:12.608 --> 13:14.076
True.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.631
Um, it's just... strange.
I mean, you...

13:21.134 --> 13:23.735
Yeah, I know.
I only just found out.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.701
It's been a somewhat
bumpy transition.

13:26.702 --> 13:30.288
I can relate.

13:31.057 --> 13:37.194
I tried to talk to them, but no one
seems to see me or hear me.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.769
Except you.

13:40.803 --> 13:44.139
I can see things
normal people can't.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.743
The thing is,
you are pure energy now.

13:47.777 --> 13:52.497
That's why sometimes when
you touch me, we get a shock.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.583
I don't mind the shock.

14:06.227 --> 14:09.163
Two more? You guys,
give me a sec.

14:27.129 --> 14:30.228
Hey, we need to talk. I want
to know what you're doing here.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.446
Why? Are you worried
about something?

14:32.447 --> 14:35.609
No, I'm not. Well,
maybe you should be.

14:38.761 --> 14:41.997
Hey, I'm not done
talking to you.

14:42.031 --> 14:44.722
Freya? You okay?

14:44.723 --> 14:47.029
- I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?
- Oh, you tell me.

14:47.030 --> 14:48.720
You're the one out here
shouting at no one.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.113
I'm not shouting at no one.
I'm not shouting at all.

14:51.114 --> 14:52.949
I was talking to Elyse.

14:54.086 --> 14:55.594
Who?

14:55.595 --> 14:58.480
Elyse... Dash's old fiancée,
the one you slept with?

14:58.514 --> 15:00.515
She just left.

15:00.549 --> 15:03.218
Freya, I think
someone was messing with you.

15:03.954 --> 15:05.973
Elyse is dead.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.386
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

15:19.440 --> 15:24.789
Mmm! Well, I, for one, am relieved
this is finally over, Joanna.

15:24.813 --> 15:27.544
Look me in the eye and swear

15:27.545 --> 15:30.677
that you did not cast another
spell on that poor woman.

15:30.678 --> 15:32.053
- What are you talking about?
- Joanna...

15:32.054 --> 15:35.311
Because... No, we both know
how dangerous memory spells are...

15:35.312 --> 15:37.953
Dangerous and irreversible.

15:40.248 --> 15:43.091
Okay, she went through
something traumatic.

15:43.092 --> 15:46.495
And she clearly
got confused... it happens.

15:46.496 --> 15:49.529
I didn't do anything, Jo...
you know what? Congratulations.

15:49.530 --> 15:52.324
It's been really great
celebrating with the two of you.

15:54.192 --> 15:56.388
- Do you believe her?
- Not for a second.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.374
But that's what we do
for people we love.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.310
I'd do anything for you.

16:01.344 --> 16:03.712
Anything?

16:07.340 --> 16:10.519
Hey, are ghosts real?

16:10.582 --> 16:11.919
Yeah, of course.

16:11.958 --> 16:13.858
Don't say, "of course."
There's no "of course."

16:13.892 --> 16:15.532
What do you think
happens when we die?

16:15.533 --> 16:17.445
We become spirits, and we cross
over into the spirit world.

16:17.479 --> 16:19.363
Okay, so, there's witches,
there's ghosts.

16:19.366 --> 16:21.900
- Are there vampires?
- Oh, please don't be ridiculous.

16:21.950 --> 16:24.996
Why this sudden interest
in ghosts? They're very rare.

16:25.019 --> 16:26.855
There's not much for
them in this world.

16:26.856 --> 16:28.456
They would much rather
be where they belong.

16:28.490 --> 16:31.665
Well, apparently, Dash's
ex-fiancée didn't get the memo.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.612
- She's dead?!
- Yeah. Killian told me.

16:34.630 --> 16:37.979
She killed herself five years ago.
It was the night Dash broke up with her.

16:37.980 --> 16:40.044
She took a bunch of pills, and
he was the one who found her.

16:40.045 --> 16:41.222
Oh, God, that's awful.

16:41.225 --> 16:43.454
I know, and he never told me
about it.

16:43.455 --> 16:45.256
Just like he never told me
he had a brother.

16:45.290 --> 16:48.292
Just like he never told me he was
ever engaged in the first place.

16:48.310 --> 16:49.894
He keeps a lot of secrets,
Wendy.

16:49.928 --> 16:52.972
Yeah, well, cut him some slack.
We all have our secrets.

16:53.849 --> 16:55.466
So what do I do about Elyse?

16:55.484 --> 16:58.550
I don't exactly enjoy being haunted
by my fiancé's ex-fiancée.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.938
Well, unfortunately, you can't
force a ghost to leave.

17:00.939 --> 17:02.440
They have to choose
to go on their own.

17:02.474 --> 17:05.915
So she can just, like, hang
around indefinitely? Forever?

17:05.916 --> 17:08.480
Yeah. Have you seen
any sign of her before this?

17:08.481 --> 17:12.415
No. Well, then what I'm wondering is,
how she got here in the first place.

17:12.451 --> 17:14.151
Ghosts can't cross
back on their own.

17:14.169 --> 17:15.536
They need someone to
open the door for them.

17:15.587 --> 17:18.330
Oh, my God!
No, she didn't!

17:18.332 --> 17:21.342
Who? Who didn't?
Who didn't?

17:23.161 --> 17:26.463
Wait. Wait. Who...?
She didn't? What?

17:28.795 --> 17:30.396
I knew it!

17:31.373 --> 17:34.522
Um, they can't see me, right?

17:34.556 --> 17:35.840
- Oh.
- Yeah, we can.

17:35.874 --> 17:40.426
No wonder you're not in mourning!
You're too busy up here getting laid.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.597
Um, Adam, can you excuse us
for just a minute?

17:43.598 --> 17:44.843
Yes.

17:46.235 --> 17:49.320
- Adam. Mm-hmm.
- Hi. Hi.

17:53.075 --> 17:56.342
I didn't resurrect him. I would
not make that mistake again.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.379
- All I did was summon his spirit.
- Yeah.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.381
And you allowed another spirit
to piggyback on the spell.

18:00.415 --> 18:03.367
Now, Dash's dead fiancée
is here messing with Freya!

18:03.368 --> 18:04.519
- What?!
- Yeah.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.962
But I did my research.
That was not in the book.

18:06.963 --> 18:08.706
I didn't know something
like this could happen.

18:08.707 --> 18:12.376
What you don't realize about witchcraft
could fill a library, Ingrid.

18:12.394 --> 18:15.219
That's why I asked you to let
your mother and me guide you,

18:15.220 --> 18:17.348
so something like this
didn't happen again.

18:17.382 --> 18:20.211
- I know you feel terrible about the curse.
- What curse?

18:20.237 --> 18:21.811
But this is not the way
to deal with your guilt.

18:21.812 --> 18:24.021
This is not about guilt!
I love him!

18:24.022 --> 18:27.215
- I just wanted to be with him.
- You can't be with him.

18:27.216 --> 18:28.526
He doesn't belong here.

18:28.527 --> 18:31.366
And if he doesn't leave soon,
he's gonna be stuck here forever.

18:31.396 --> 18:32.941
Tonight is a full moon.

18:32.942 --> 18:36.563
If he doesn't leave by sunrise,
then he can never move on.

18:36.568 --> 18:39.088
But you knew that,
didn't you, Ingrid?

18:39.089 --> 18:41.051
That was definitely
in the book.

18:41.052 --> 18:45.209
I can think of worst fates than
spending my life with someone I love.

18:46.632 --> 18:49.714
Honey... you're gonna change

18:49.748 --> 18:52.600
and grow and keep
moving forward.

18:52.634 --> 18:54.418
He's gonna be
trapped in a world

18:54.436 --> 18:58.181
where most of the people he knows
and loves can't even see him.

18:58.182 --> 18:59.999
Don't do that to him.

19:01.172 --> 19:05.363
And don't limit your life to being stuck
in this room, hiding from the world.

19:07.897 --> 19:12.069
That's been most of my life anyway,
but at least now, I'm not alone.

19:12.103 --> 19:13.738
Please get out.

19:13.772 --> 19:15.605
- Ingrid...
- Go!

19:36.294 --> 19:39.680
Good things really
do come to those who wait.

19:42.689 --> 19:45.831
Oh, you're the most extraordinary
woman, you know that?

19:54.349 --> 19:55.924
You're not so bad yourself.

19:58.316 --> 20:00.668
Thank you.

20:05.624 --> 20:07.091
Why are you dressed?

20:07.125 --> 20:10.063
No, no, no, no. We should be
ordering Chinese food right now,

20:10.064 --> 20:12.220
and I can feed you
dumplings... naked.

20:12.221 --> 20:13.972
I wish I could.

20:14.299 --> 20:16.826
I feel like I should really
be here for Ingrid tonight.

20:16.827 --> 20:18.709
She's going through a hard time.

20:18.779 --> 20:20.504
And...

20:20.522 --> 20:24.141
I just assume that now that
you're done with my case,

20:24.176 --> 20:26.477
that you probably have other
clients you need to deal with?

20:26.511 --> 20:29.780
- Right?
- Yeah.

20:29.815 --> 20:31.982
Should be getting back
to the city, right?

20:34.243 --> 20:39.190
I have some errands that,
um, I need to run.

20:40.191 --> 20:41.859
That was really great.

20:57.542 --> 20:59.977
I wish you could hear me.

21:00.011 --> 21:03.014
I'm sorry for what I did.
I never meant to hurt you.

21:03.278 --> 21:06.016
And it wasn't your fault,
what happened.

21:06.084 --> 21:07.818
I know you found me.

21:07.853 --> 21:10.154
I know you tried
to save me.

21:10.188 --> 21:12.556
Goddamn it.

21:12.574 --> 21:16.059
Oh, come on.

21:32.410 --> 21:34.011
Hey.

21:34.045 --> 21:36.847
Oh, look! The bartender's
feeling threatened.

21:36.882 --> 21:38.832
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.840
Actually, I don't know how
pleasant this is gonna be.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.770
- Why? What are you doing?
- What's up?

21:42.804 --> 21:44.104
I know about Elyse.

21:44.139 --> 21:46.590
I know about
what happened to her.

21:46.625 --> 21:50.078
I know that when you left her, she
went crazy and took a bunch of pills.

21:50.079 --> 21:51.755
I didn't go crazy.

21:51.763 --> 21:53.614
- Killian told you.
- Why don't you stay out of this.

21:53.648 --> 21:55.933
- This has nothing to do with you.
- I am so sorry.

21:55.951 --> 21:58.202
I-I didn't mean to keep this
a secret from you. I just...

21:58.236 --> 22:00.289
I-I hate talking about her.

22:00.290 --> 22:03.908
Okay, that part of my life, I just want
to put it behind me, put Elyse to rest.

22:03.942 --> 22:05.743
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

22:05.777 --> 22:08.379
It's normal to feel guilt
and regret in these situations.

22:08.413 --> 22:11.286
And I do feel guilt about what happened,
but I don't regret leaving her.

22:11.287 --> 22:13.227
And that just makes me
feel even more guilty.

22:13.228 --> 22:17.988
Even before Killian slept with her, deep
down I knew I didn't really love her.

22:18.023 --> 22:19.974
I was...
I was more...

22:20.008 --> 22:23.891
Hurt by what he did to me
than her betrayal.

22:24.346 --> 22:26.230
Hey.

22:26.264 --> 22:28.499
I love <i>you.</i>

22:28.533 --> 22:32.824
Our worst day together is better than my
best day with Elyse, because this is real.

22:33.939 --> 22:36.023
And I want you by my side.

22:36.074 --> 22:38.090
Forever.

22:44.683 --> 22:48.292
You can have him.
He's not the one I came for.

23:08.306 --> 23:10.274
Maura!

23:12.978 --> 23:15.145
Maura!

23:15.179 --> 23:16.530
Maura, stop!

23:36.990 --> 23:38.357
Hello?

23:38.391 --> 23:42.189
Is it possible for a ghost
to hurt someone?

23:42.190 --> 23:44.191
Like, physically,
if they wanted to?

23:44.192 --> 23:45.976
I... guess so.

23:46.043 --> 23:49.112
Yeah, I mean, I've only seen
ghosts affect electricity,

23:49.162 --> 23:51.747
you know, like turning
lights on and off, or...

23:51.781 --> 23:54.216
Making TVs go fuzzy,
but I guess they could

23:54.251 --> 23:56.907
harness electricity to hurt
someone if they wanted to. Why?

23:56.908 --> 23:59.008
Do you think that Elyse
is gonna try to hurt you?

23:59.009 --> 24:01.070
It's not me I'm worried about.

24:01.903 --> 24:04.504
Freya? Freya?

24:05.979 --> 24:08.297
She totally lost it, Wendy.

24:08.315 --> 24:12.151
She's in lockdown in the mental ward
at East End General.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.571
- I watched them take her away.
- Who?

24:15.605 --> 24:19.808
The woman whose brain you melted
with your spell... Maura Thatcher.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.478
Please don't deny it again.

24:25.999 --> 24:27.898
I saw a problem and I fixed it.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.986
- You ruined her life.
- Her life was already ruined.

24:31.004 --> 24:34.262
Her husband was murdered in cold
blood right in front of her face,

24:34.263 --> 24:36.425
and you were about to go
to jail for the crime.

24:37.498 --> 24:42.218
We have an obligation, Wendy,
not to abuse our power.

24:42.799 --> 24:45.300
Oh, please, get off
your high horse.

24:45.307 --> 24:48.837
Someone who's killed a man with
a fireplace poker four days ago?

24:48.855 --> 24:50.355
Oh, that was
completely different.

24:50.357 --> 24:51.941
Oh, of course that was
completely different,

24:51.975 --> 24:54.360
because everything you do
is righteous and justified.

24:54.394 --> 24:57.625
And everything I do is wrong...
even when I'm trying to help.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.949
You know what, next time
try saying, "Thank you, Wendy,

24:59.983 --> 25:02.518
thank you for doing
what needed to be done."

25:02.536 --> 25:04.911
But I won't hold my breath!

25:17.594 --> 25:19.478
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:19.607 --> 25:21.574
Wh-what's up, Freya?

25:21.586 --> 25:26.556
Have you noticed any weird electrical
problems happening in the bar tonight?

25:26.557 --> 25:30.653
Blew a couple of fuses this morning,
and the jukebox had some problems.

25:30.724 --> 25:33.740
Anything else... weird?

25:33.741 --> 25:36.209
Well, you're being a little
weird, now that you mention it.

25:36.210 --> 25:38.564
Isn't this your night off?

25:38.598 --> 25:40.783
Yeah. Sorry, I just, uh,

25:40.799 --> 25:42.535
I knew it was
your first night working solo.

25:42.569 --> 25:44.569
Thought you might need
a little help closing.

25:46.106 --> 25:48.458
Yeah. Should be a real bear.

25:52.396 --> 25:55.240
There's something...
I have to tell you,

25:55.282 --> 25:58.084
and I understand if...

25:58.118 --> 26:00.670
You hate me when I do.

26:01.972 --> 26:07.043
- It's kind of my fault you died.
- What-what are you talking about?

26:08.796 --> 26:11.981
I... I did a spell

26:12.016 --> 26:15.268
I shouldn't have done,
and there was a price.

26:15.302 --> 26:18.771
The price was someone
I loved had to die.

26:18.805 --> 26:21.941
I didn't know
it would be you.

26:21.975 --> 26:25.726
And I couldn't stop it.
I'm so sorry.

26:25.773 --> 26:28.458
I know that
changes how you...

26:28.492 --> 26:31.378
Feel about me.

26:31.412 --> 26:33.380
Ingrid.

26:35.082 --> 26:37.678
I forgive you.

26:38.002 --> 26:40.615
It was an accident.

26:41.055 --> 26:45.008
Oh, God, it gets worse.

26:45.042 --> 26:47.342
There's something else
you need to know.

26:47.343 --> 26:50.533
That my window to the
other side is... closing.

26:50.534 --> 26:51.657
How did...

26:51.658 --> 26:56.653
Death brings an intrinsic wisdom
that's... hard to explain.

26:57.038 --> 27:00.507
Plus, you guys were really loud when
you were talking about it earlier.

27:05.446 --> 27:08.698
I want you to be
where you belong.

27:08.732 --> 27:11.251
I don't know where I belong.

27:12.929 --> 27:16.882
If I go, I... don't know
where I'm going to.

27:16.883 --> 27:19.835
And if I stay, then I don't
know what that means for us.

27:20.973 --> 27:25.248
I don't want you to feel obligated
to build your life around a ghost.

27:25.299 --> 27:27.947
- What if you got sick of me?
- No.

27:27.948 --> 27:30.603
I don't think that's possible.

27:30.638 --> 27:35.541
Am I a terrible person for wanting
to be with the man I love?

27:35.542 --> 27:37.360
Oh, no, no, no, no.

27:37.395 --> 27:40.280
No more than I am for...

27:40.314 --> 27:42.932
Wanting to stay.

27:55.079 --> 27:58.166
Okay, don't take this
the wrong way, but go home.

27:58.174 --> 28:00.984
- I've seriously got this covered.
- What? I'm just trying to help you.

28:01.018 --> 28:03.624
- What's the big deal?
- First you love me, then you hate me,

28:03.625 --> 28:05.055
now you love me again?

28:05.056 --> 28:08.525
- Well... I can't keep up.
- I never loved you.

28:08.526 --> 28:11.261
I never hated you, I'm just
trying to help out a brother.

28:11.295 --> 28:12.729
In-law.

28:13.671 --> 28:17.133
You are extremely weird,
you know that, right?

28:17.533 --> 28:19.033
Weird.

28:25.943 --> 28:28.111
Uh, Elyse...

28:28.145 --> 28:29.953
I know you are here.

28:29.954 --> 28:32.665
You're upset, I get it;
I would be, too.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.618
But you shouldn't punish Killian
for your mistake.

28:35.652 --> 28:37.620
This isn't his fault.

28:42.793 --> 28:46.496
Elyse? Can you hear me?

28:59.150 --> 29:02.479
There's nothing left
for you here anymore, Elyse.

29:02.513 --> 29:04.981
It's time for you to let go.

29:05.015 --> 29:07.484
I don't have to let go
of anything.

29:07.502 --> 29:10.997
You do if you ever want to get out of
here, you have until the sun comes up.

29:10.998 --> 29:13.661
I am not leaving until
I get what I came for.

29:13.672 --> 29:15.998
Hurting Killian is not gonna heal
your pain, Elyse.

29:16.006 --> 29:17.832
I don't want to hurt him,
I want to be with him.

29:17.833 --> 29:20.771
He finally slept with me, and then
he didn't want to be with me anymore.

29:20.772 --> 29:24.498
But I still love him.
I have always loved him.

29:24.516 --> 29:27.301
So I'm gonna take him with me.

29:27.335 --> 29:29.537
No! Elyse, stop!

29:36.878 --> 29:38.810
Freya, what is going on?
Who are you talking to...?

29:38.811 --> 29:40.982
Killian, don't touch the light!

29:43.652 --> 29:45.620
Killian, can
you hear me?

29:45.654 --> 29:48.693
Killian...
Oh, God, are you okay?

29:49.263 --> 29:51.698
Patient unconscious and not
breathing when we arrived.

29:51.732 --> 29:54.928
- No pulse.
- Crash cart!

29:59.680 --> 30:01.297
Clear.

30:06.046 --> 30:08.080
Going again.
Give him an epi.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.432
Clear.

30:11.163 --> 30:13.431
Going again.
Give him an epi.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.700
Clear.

30:41.205 --> 30:44.973
Were you waiting up just to
kick me out of your life again?

30:46.919 --> 30:50.364
Firstly, you were right.

30:50.398 --> 30:54.424
How can I be on my high horse
when I killed a man four days ago?

30:54.425 --> 30:58.195
It was self-defense.
Like what I did to Maura.

30:58.614 --> 31:01.206
At least that's what
I've been trying to tell myself.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.690
- Can I just say something?
- Let me finish...

31:02.691 --> 31:06.291
I know that I can be impulsive
and it's a problem, but...

31:06.292 --> 31:08.927
I felt like it was
either her or you,

31:08.928 --> 31:10.931
and in that situation,
I will always pick you.

31:10.936 --> 31:12.403
I slept with Harrison.

31:12.437 --> 31:15.033
What?! Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

31:15.034 --> 31:16.824
Slow down. Okay...

31:16.858 --> 31:18.659
Details... how was it?

31:18.693 --> 31:20.313
What?

31:20.314 --> 31:22.144
- It was great, actually.
- It was?

31:22.145 --> 31:24.999
It was great, it was better
than I had ever imagined,

31:25.033 --> 31:27.451
and then I ran out of there
like my hair was on fire.

31:27.485 --> 31:31.472
Was it? What? It's not like
it would be the first time.

31:31.824 --> 31:36.020
- He looked... He looked so happy.
- Aw...

31:36.021 --> 31:38.393
And I just felt the
walls closing in on me.

31:38.394 --> 31:40.462
I don't know why,
I just ran out of there.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.811
I know why. You've
been alone for so long,

31:42.812 --> 31:44.862
you don't know how to open up
and be vulnerable,

31:44.863 --> 31:47.054
but that was a really
good first step.

31:48.506 --> 31:50.941
I just don't think
that Harrison would agree.

31:50.976 --> 31:52.977
Oh, please, he'll be
all right, he's a big boy.

31:53.028 --> 31:54.311
That's really true.

31:55.697 --> 31:57.400
Joanna, you little minx.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.956
Oh, God, I do feel
bad about Maura.

32:05.991 --> 32:08.692
I had no idea that she would
have such a severe reaction.

32:08.743 --> 32:12.496
That is exactly why
those spells are so dangerous.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.465
Okay, I know, all right?
I know, I know.

32:14.499 --> 32:18.052
Will you just... will you
help me make it right?

32:18.086 --> 32:19.863
Wendy, we can't make it right.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.508
But I can help you make it
a little better.

32:36.237 --> 32:37.888
Hey.

32:39.074 --> 32:40.424
What happened?

32:40.458 --> 32:44.745
The electrical system at the bar
went haywire, and you got a shock.

32:44.779 --> 32:48.732
The last thing I remember was you saying
you loved me, then I took out the trash.

32:48.750 --> 32:50.701
I actually didn't say that,
you did.

32:50.735 --> 32:52.703
Oh, right.

32:53.955 --> 32:56.340
I'm just glad you're okay.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.342
That was really scary.

33:01.579 --> 33:04.348
And because I'm such an
awesome sister-in-law,

33:04.382 --> 33:06.083
I'm gonna get you
whatever you want

33:06.101 --> 33:08.685
from the vending machine,
as long as it's pretzels,

33:08.720 --> 33:10.754
because they're out
of everything else.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.940
You're not
my sister-in-law yet.

33:15.605 --> 33:17.394
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.563
Go get some rest.
I got him.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.699
Okay. Okay.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.035
As soon as
you get out of here,

33:25.070 --> 33:27.371
we need to get you
a haircut.

33:27.405 --> 33:30.908
You do realize I almost died
tonight, right?

33:30.942 --> 33:33.276
Plus, I'm not seven.

33:33.294 --> 33:36.280
But I will always
be your mom.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.265
Thanks, man.

33:50.145 --> 33:53.263
Yeah.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.119
Just doing my job.

34:07.829 --> 34:10.831
Elyse, is this what you wanted?

34:10.864 --> 34:14.751
I'm not the psycho you think
I am... at least I wasn't.

34:14.786 --> 34:18.338
I-I just... I love him more
than you could understand.

34:19.456 --> 34:21.592
I do understand.

34:21.626 --> 34:24.045
I just don't think you want
to wander this world

34:24.045 --> 34:26.630
filled with anger and regret
for the rest of eternity,

34:26.664 --> 34:30.350
which is what will happen
if you don't leave soon.

34:30.385 --> 34:33.219
You have less than an hour
until sunrise.

34:34.226 --> 34:38.475
I left Killian once. I don't think
I can leave him again.

34:38.509 --> 34:42.146
If you really love him, that's
exactly what you will do,

34:42.179 --> 34:44.114
for both your sakes.

34:45.400 --> 34:50.353
I can't force you, but I can
help you if you let me.

34:56.426 --> 34:58.715
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:02.103 --> 35:04.404
- Can't sleep?
- Uh-uh.

35:07.872 --> 35:10.724
Wendy told me about Adam.

35:10.758 --> 35:14.061
I'm sorry, I know
I shouldn't have done it.

35:14.095 --> 35:18.548
I'm not mad at you.
I do understand, Ingrid.

35:18.566 --> 35:20.955
You're in love.

35:21.049 --> 35:24.727
- So, what am I going to do now?
- I don't know.

35:25.607 --> 35:28.467
I guess you have
a decision to make.

35:28.490 --> 35:30.868
- That's it?
- Yeah...

35:30.869 --> 35:32.329
- That's all I get?
- Yeah.

35:32.363 --> 35:34.919
Shouldn't you give me some
kind of motherly advice,

35:34.966 --> 35:37.668
like "Follow your heart"
or "Do the right thing"?

35:37.702 --> 35:40.754
Follow your heart.

35:40.788 --> 35:43.188
Do the right thing.

35:48.546 --> 35:52.182
That's not very helpful.

35:52.217 --> 35:55.852
They're not the same
thing in this case.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.855
Mom, I've never been
in love before.

35:58.890 --> 36:02.025
I didn't think it
was possible for me.

36:03.261 --> 36:05.429
What do I do?

36:06.938 --> 36:12.119
You know what I can tell you is that
I have known you over many years,

36:12.120 --> 36:13.603
over many lifetimes,

36:13.610 --> 36:16.873
and I have seen
you love before.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.442
This is not
the first time

36:19.460 --> 36:22.445
and it won't be
the last.

36:26.677 --> 36:29.528
ADAM NOBLE
Beloved Son and Friend

36:45.103 --> 36:47.070
I don't want to leave.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.072
I don't want you to,

36:49.107 --> 36:52.442
but I can't hold you back
from where you belong.

36:52.476 --> 36:56.280
But you can always
come get me, right?

36:56.314 --> 36:59.716
Summon me again
if you miss me?

36:59.751 --> 37:04.054
I asked Wendy
about that, and...

37:05.840 --> 37:09.960
...she said you only
get one trip back here.

37:09.994 --> 37:11.744
This was it.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.765
The spell won't
work a second time.

37:14.799 --> 37:17.801
When you go this time,

37:17.835 --> 37:19.803
you go.

37:20.644 --> 37:22.645
I'll be watching over you.

37:24.609 --> 37:27.110
'Cause we're always going
to be connected.

37:36.904 --> 37:39.479
Okay, you ready?

37:43.761 --> 37:47.644
You know, we're a lot more
alike than I first thought.

37:47.894 --> 37:52.047
I was torn between
Dash and Killian, too.

37:52.870 --> 37:55.538
Take care of him.

37:55.556 --> 37:58.375
Take care of
both of them.

37:58.393 --> 38:03.146
Make sure that they don't
hate each other forever.

38:06.754 --> 38:08.739
You ready?

38:20.448 --> 38:23.566
<i>Spiritus...</i>

38:23.584 --> 38:25.669

38:57.428 --> 39:00.233

<i>ad interitum.</i>

39:22.660 --> 39:24.628
Good-bye.

39:45.616 --> 39:47.951
Oh, hello, you two.

39:47.985 --> 39:50.253
How nice to see you
on this fine day.

39:50.288 --> 39:53.423
- Is everything all right?
- You tell us.

39:53.458 --> 39:57.130
Everything is just perfect today,
as far as I'm concerned.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.663
So glad to hear it.
