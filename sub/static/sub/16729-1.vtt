00:29.112 --> 00:31.603
So this is the 300.

00:31.698 --> 00:35.987
The forward look. 1958 is here today.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.906
That's the Ermine White.
Seventeen coats, hand-sanded.

00:39.331 --> 00:42.539
- I'm sure it's the 17th coat that does it.
- Power steering, power windows,

00:42.626 --> 00:44.617
power brakes, power mirrors.

00:44.795 --> 00:47.127
The new auto-pilot will
make you virtually superfluous.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.167
- I'm not sure I need a car for that.
- TorqueFlite transmission.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.541
The standard that sets the standard.

00:52.636 --> 00:55.002
And the top operates by
just the touch of a button.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.971
- I can feel the wind in my hair already.
- You just out of school?

00:58.058 --> 01:01.016
- Harvard Law School.
- That degree sells itself.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.135
Do you live here in Washington?

01:03.230 --> 01:06.017
- I've been working for the government.
- Oh.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.440
- Not that it's permanent.
- Oh.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.977
Care to get behind the wheel,
Mr. Goodman?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.902
- Goodwin.
- Oh.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.360
Just be careful with the cigar.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.238
Used to be a man drove the car.
Now the car drives the man.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.489
Go on. Turn it over.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.203
- Here? Is it, uh...
- Go on. It's in neutral.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.168
Listen to that power.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.504
- This is the town for it.
- And with the new Bendix Electrojector,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.214
we can rate this honey up to...

01:40.225 --> 01:43.513
- 390 horsepower.
- Correct to the hoof.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.515
If my wife knew I was here,
she'd kill me.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.016
What a way to go.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.849
- Yeah.
- I see you're admiring the seats.

01:49.860 --> 01:53.694
That's pigskin and calfskin.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.111
Hand rubbed.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.905
Nicest piece of furniture I own
would be in the garage.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.615
Try the radio.

01:59.703 --> 02:03.070
The only thing that sounds
better than the engine is the radio.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.752
<i>The Russians have beaten</i>
<i>us into outer space.</i>

02:10.756 --> 02:13.463
<i>You are listening</i>
<i>to the sound of</i> Sputnik,

02:13.550 --> 02:16.417
<i>a satellite launched</i>
<i>this morning via rocket,</i>

02:16.511 --> 02:19.253
<i>in orbit, right now,</i>
<i>directly over our heads.</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:24.224
<i>A sound that says</i>
<i>all is not well with America.</i>

02:24.686 --> 02:26.768
America doesn't own the 300.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.688
<i>Oh, the shark, babe</i>

02:35.405 --> 02:38.021
<i>Has such teeth, dear</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:41.157
<i>And he shows them</i>

02:41.244 --> 02:43.951
<i>Pearly white</i>

02:43.955 --> 02:46.788
<i>Just a jackknife</i>

02:46.792 --> 02:50.000
<i>Has old Macheath, babe</i>

02:50.087 --> 02:55.127
<i>And he keeps it out of sight</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:56.919
<i>You know when that shark bites</i>

02:58.387 --> 03:01.254
<i>With his teeth, babe</i>

03:01.348 --> 03:03.054
<i>Scarlet billows</i>

03:03.975 --> 03:06.933
<i>Start to spread</i>

03:06.937 --> 03:09.428
<i>Fancy gloves, oh</i>

03:09.439 --> 03:12.602
<i>Wears old Macheath, babe</i>

03:12.609 --> 03:14.770
<i>So there's never</i>

03:14.861 --> 03:17.147
<i>Never a trace of red</i>

03:18.490 --> 03:21.106
<i>Now on the sidewalk</i>
<i>Uh-huh, uh-huh</i>

03:21.118 --> 03:24.281
<i>Ooh, Sunday mornin', uh-huh</i>

03:24.287 --> 03:26.869
<i>Lies a body</i>

03:26.957 --> 03:28.117
<i>Just oozin' life</i>

03:29.793 --> 03:33.001
<i>And someone's sneakin'</i>

03:33.004 --> 03:35.962
<i>'Round the corner</i>

03:35.966 --> 03:38.503
<i>Could that someone</i>

03:38.510 --> 03:40.466
<i>Be Mack the Knife?</i>

03:41.471 --> 03:44.338
<i>Now did ya hear about Louie Miller</i>

03:44.349 --> 03:47.637
<i>He disappeared, babe</i>

03:47.644 --> 03:49.805
<i>After drawin' out</i>

03:50.313 --> 03:52.975
<i>All his hard-earned cash</i>

03:53.066 --> 03:56.024
<i>And now Macheath spends</i>

03:56.027 --> 03:59.019
<i>Just like a sailor</i>

03:59.656 --> 04:04.992
<i>Could it be our boy's done</i>
<i>somethin' rash?</i>

04:05.078 --> 04:06.659
<i>Ah, Jenny Diver</i>

04:07.789 --> 04:11.031
<i>Hey, Suki Tawdry</i>

04:11.126 --> 04:13.868
<i>Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya</i>

04:13.879 --> 04:17.166
<i>And old Lucy Brown</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:19.711
<i>Oh, the line forms</i>

04:19.801 --> 04:23.043
<i>On the right, babe</i>

04:23.138 --> 04:29.008
<i>Now that Mackie's</i>

04:29.144 --> 04:31.556
<i>Back in town</i>

04:31.646 --> 04:35.605
- What's this? Get this thing out of here.
- It's not my station.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.899
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
- We're still hot on the right.

04:37.903 --> 04:38.892
Watch it.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.607
Oh, it's very exciting.
You know, my mother said that...

04:45.702 --> 04:47.442
Hey, those are the questions.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.027
Ah, he's got the questions there.

04:49.498 --> 04:54.583
Like walking on the bottom of the sea,

04:54.586 --> 04:58.750
as if I had drowned long ago.

04:58.757 --> 04:59.963
- As if...
- Five minutes, Mr. Barry.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.753
- We're ready, Mr. Barry.
- You ready, America?

05:05.764 --> 05:07.675
Oh, thanks, Tim.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.597
- All right, one minute.
- Move a little to your left.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.966
Hey, video,
you done with the test patterns?

05:11.061 --> 05:12.301
Camera one.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.807
Okay, clear the floor, folks.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.559
- Marty, you're still very hot.
- Light it up.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.555
Lighting.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.733
- Stand by. Thirty seconds.
- Give me his opening shots, please.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.068
- Thirty seconds to air.
- I'm getting a glare on camera one.

05:22.072 --> 05:25.314
You think you can adjust the barn door
on Jack's back light? Yeah, if you can.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.568
Twenty seconds.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.616
My light okay?
My nose doesn't look big?

05:28.703 --> 05:31.786
- You look great, Jack.
- Last week I looked like a sun dial.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.238
Jack, we're on countdown.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.912
Coming to air in ten,
nine, eight, seven...

05:36.002 --> 05:36.991
Stand by, timpani.
Stand by, opening film.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.668
- Stand by, music. Stand by, announcer.
...six, five,

05:39.005 --> 05:43.590
- four, three, two, one.
- Cue the timpani.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.801
And fade up. Announce.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.923
Geritol. America's #1 tonic.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.767
<i>Geritol, the fast-acting,</i>
<i>high-potency tonic</i>

05:53.770 --> 05:56.887

05:57.190 --> 06:00.148
<i>presents the exciting</i>
<i>quiz program...</i>

06:00.151 --> 06:02.062
Twenty-One.

06:02.654 --> 06:06.146
<i>Brought to you by NBC,</i>
<i>the National Broadcasting Company,</i>

06:06.157 --> 06:08.443

<i>Two players racing to score 21 points,</i>

06:27.137 --> 06:29.344
<i>each in a soundproof television studio,</i>

06:29.347 --> 06:31.383
<i>not knowing the other one's score,</i>

06:31.975 --> 06:35.058
<i>- with $500 riding on each point...</i>
- Damn it!

06:35.478 --> 06:37.389
<i>...as they both play...</i>

06:37.480 --> 06:39.471
Twenty-One!

06:41.776 --> 06:45.143
<i>And here's your host, Jack Barry!</i>

06:50.827 --> 06:52.738
Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

06:52.829 --> 06:57.198
Due to a series of ties, Herbert Stempel,
our 29-year-old ex-G.I. College student,

06:57.292 --> 06:59.999
must play at $3,000 a point,

07:00.003 --> 07:02.039
which means that
in a few brief minutes,

07:02.047 --> 07:05.005
he can either win as much as $ 100,000,

07:05.091 --> 07:07.047
the most money won on television
to date,

07:07.135 --> 07:10.047
or lose everything he's won
in the last eight weeks.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.342
You nervous?

07:13.350 --> 07:15.215
It's only money.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.596
Isolated in their soundproof studios,

07:17.687 --> 07:20.394
neither player is aware
of the other's score.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.689
I've been assured by our friends
at the Encyclopedia

07:22.776 --> 07:25.688
that they've concocted some
real brain-breakers this week,

07:25.695 --> 07:27.526
so we'll find out in the next 30 minutes

07:27.530 --> 07:31.068
if the unstumpable
Herbert Stempel can be stumped.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.193
Could I have the questions, please?

07:34.871 --> 07:35.951
Thank you, gentlemen.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.870
Remember, the questions on
<i>Twenty-One</i> are secured each week

07:38.500 --> 07:41.867
in a Manhattan bank vault
till just before show time.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.250
So right now, let's meet Herbert
Stempel and his challenger as Geritol,

07:45.340 --> 07:48.298
America's #1 tonic,
presents <i>Twenty-One.</i>

07:54.766 --> 07:56.802
Welcome back to the show, gentlemen.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.430
Mr. Peloubet, a very cordial
welcome to you, sir.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.302
How are you, Herb?
How's everything in Queens?

08:01.398 --> 08:04.265
- Fine, Mr. Barry.
- It's a nervous strain in the family, I bet.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.224
- How's your wife holding out?
- She's fine, thank you.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.942
Thank you, Mr. Barry, for asking.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.144
As you know, Herb, the questions

08:09.239 --> 08:11.776
are graded for difficulty
by the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica...</i>

08:11.866 --> 08:15.279
I might add that my wife
no longer suffers from tired blood,

08:15.286 --> 08:17.242
now that I've got her on Geritol.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.116
That's fine.
Graded on a scale from one...

08:19.124 --> 08:21.740
I personally vouch that
it's a fine product.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.742
I'm sure our sponsor
will be pleased to know that, Herb.

08:23.753 --> 08:24.959
Now, to get on with the show...

08:25.046 --> 08:27.583
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank Geritol

08:27.590 --> 08:31.082
<i>for giving a poor ex-G. I.</i>
<i>This amazing opportunity</i>

08:31.094 --> 08:33.585
<i>to realize his dream</i>
<i>of a college education.</i>

08:36.390 --> 08:38.131
Now there's a face for radio.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.676
<i>Dick Peloubet back again</i>
<i>from sunny Miami, Florida,</i>

08:41.770 --> 08:42.851
<i>and Herb Stempel.</i>

08:42.938 --> 08:44.770
- Yeah.
- Stempel is giving me a headache.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.440
- Well, he sells Geritol.
<i>- Have you seen the ratings?</i>

08:47.444 --> 08:50.527
- Well, they've evened out.
- I don't think he works anymore.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.320
Stempel is an underdog.
You know, people root for that.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.609
It's a New York thing.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.198
Queens is not New York.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.118
<i>Let's play</i> Twenty-One.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.166
Mr. Kintner's office, please.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.511
<i>Office of the President.</i>
<i>Could you hold, please?</i>

09:16.514 --> 09:17.503
<i>Mr. Kintner's office.</i>

09:17.599 --> 09:20.511
Once inside the isolation booth,
neither player can see the other,

09:20.518 --> 09:21.553
nor can they hear anything

09:21.644 --> 09:24.977
until I turn their studios on,
which I'm gonna do right now.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.389
<i>All right, gentlemen?</i>

09:29.861 --> 09:32.898
- He's not hurting sales, is he?
- He just doesn't think he works.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.820
- Why?
- Look, I don't know.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.739
I guess the sponsor wants a guy
on <i>Twenty-One</i>

09:36.826 --> 09:38.817
who looks like he'd get a table at 21.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.029
You just tell him I said Stempel
has an everyman quality.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.206
You know that whole American
dream thing? You, too, can be rich?

09:45.293 --> 09:48.000
- If the ratings stay high.
- Very funny.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.080
I'm just passing it along, sir.

09:55.095 --> 09:58.713
Every schoolboy knows about
the midnight ride of Paul Revere.

09:58.807 --> 10:03.050
For 11 points, how many lanterns
were hung in the Old North Church?

10:03.144 --> 10:06.011
Who rode with Paul Revere?
Who lent him his horse?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.062
Was it a mare or a stallion?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.606
<i>And what was the horse's name?</i>

10:11.027 --> 10:13.564
<i>- Stand by, Joe, on Herbie.</i>
- Kill the air.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.690
Tommy, air off.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.158
Uh...

10:25.959 --> 10:28.041
<i>A little tighter. Kelly, put the sign up.</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:31.541
Control booth. Uh, yeah, hold on, sir.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.505
Dan, it's for you. It's Kintner.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.795
Would you mind, Mr. Barry,
could I take the third part last?

10:40.223 --> 10:42.509
<i>That's fine.</i>

10:42.600 --> 10:47.720
The code was, uh,
"One if by land, two if by sea."

10:47.730 --> 10:51.564
<i>Therefore, it would have to be</i>
<i>two lanterns in the Old North Church.</i>

10:51.568 --> 10:55.060
<i>That's right. And the second part.</i>
<i>Who rode with him?</i>

10:55.155 --> 10:58.613
- Dawes and Prescott.
<i>- Dawes and Prescott.</i>

11:01.828 --> 11:04.786
What these books have conclusively
proven is that the difference

11:04.789 --> 11:07.496
between men and women
is exactly 38 pages.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.573
Can I quote you, Mark?

11:08.668 --> 11:09.999
Not before I quote me.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.576
His own quotes
are his greatest pleasure.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.457
Did you hear the market dropped
30 points today?

11:13.464 --> 11:14.624
There's a rumor Eisenhower died.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.963
How would they tell?

11:16.050 --> 11:18.336
Oh, please, don't get Dorothy
started on politics.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.339
- There'll be a raid.
- Good night.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.513
Good night, Dorothy. Sorry I'm late.
It's impossible out there.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.309
- You can't get a cab without a dragnet.
- Eisenhower died.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.635
- What?
- Professor Van Doren,

11:28.646 --> 11:30.477
I took your course at Columbia,

11:30.481 --> 11:32.847
Hawthorne, Original Sin
and the American Experience.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.807
- Nixon is president?
- Well, as silly as it sounds,

11:34.819 --> 11:35.934
it changed my life.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.776
Was it the Hawthorne or the sin?

11:37.780 --> 11:40.943
Perhaps you'd like to meet my son,
the unmarried Van Doren.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.366
- Oh, where is Charlie?
<i>- You're right again, Herb.</i>

11:43.453 --> 11:46.945
<i>You got the first two parts correct.</i>
<i>Just three more for 11 points.</i>

11:46.956 --> 11:49.117
Excuse me. Are you the son?

11:49.125 --> 11:52.868
- I'm Charlie. Pleasure.
- Elizabeth. The pleasure's all mine.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.378
<i>It was a mare, Mr. Barry.</i>

11:55.632 --> 11:57.497
How did he know that?

11:57.508 --> 11:59.294
Oh, there you are.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.468
We're making our getaway, Charlie,
if you want a ride.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.679
Have you ever watched one
of these quiz shows, Dad?

12:04.682 --> 12:07.515
<i>The $64,000 Question</i> or <i>Twenty-One?</i>

12:07.518 --> 12:11.306
For $64,000, I hope they ask you
the meaning of life.

12:11.314 --> 12:16.399
<i>Okay, Herb, finally: Name the man</i>
<i>who loaned Paul Revere his horse</i>

12:16.527 --> 12:18.483
<i>for that fateful midnight ride.</i>

12:18.571 --> 12:20.436
<i>The horse. Who loaned him the horse?</i>

12:20.949 --> 12:23.031
Okay, Herb, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask for your answer.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.197
Yes, Mr. Barry.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.991
Look, just give him
what he wants.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.826
I don't want to talk
to these agency guys.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.320
So what do you want me to do,
Mr. Kintner?

12:29.415 --> 12:32.202
You're a producer, Dan. Produce.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.325
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>more time, Herb?</i>

12:33.336 --> 12:35.793
- Right.
- <i>If I may.</i>

12:39.217 --> 12:41.208
Herbie's dead.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.677
Larkin? Deacon John Larkin?

12:44.681 --> 12:47.263
That's correct for 11 points!

12:53.398 --> 12:55.354
All right, Herb, take a deep breath
and relax, will you?

12:55.650 --> 12:59.393
And we'll get back to the game
after this word from our sponsor.

13:01.990 --> 13:05.778
Now, friends, I was just wondering,
what kind of a day did you have today?

13:05.868 --> 13:08.735
Did you greet the sunrise
with plenty of vim, vigor and vitality,

13:08.746 --> 13:12.079
only to feel the wind go out
of your sails just after lunchtime?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.248
Do you find you're not having
as much fun as you used to?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.539
This beats the subway,
huh, Mr. Stempel?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.665
You said it.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.556
- Hooray!
- Hey, Herbie!

13:32.061 --> 13:34.598
You were the greatest tonight, Herbie!

13:37.233 --> 13:38.939
Great, Einstein!

13:38.943 --> 13:40.934
Hey, the audience
really loves you!

13:40.945 --> 13:42.731
Herbie, you remember me when!

13:42.822 --> 13:44.813
Herbie! I remember you when!

13:45.158 --> 13:48.070
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hey, Herbie, what color was she?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.743
You looked so good
on TV tonight, Herbie!

13:51.914 --> 13:53.745
You should have gone for 11
on the movies, Herbie.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.615
You should win $ 100,000.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.491
Hey, you were really
cookin' tonight, Stempel.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.789
- Of course I watched it.
- <i>You didn't go to the show?</i>

13:59.881 --> 14:02.497
The genius is home.
The rich genius is home.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.299
I watched it on television
like everybody else.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.421
<i>Would you tell him that...</i>

14:06.512 --> 14:08.093
You were great tonight, Herb.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.422
Come on. I wanna dance.
Dance with me.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.094
<i>Looking for the light</i>

14:12.101 --> 14:13.841
<i>Would you ask him for me,</i>
<i>please, right now?</i>

14:13.936 --> 14:14.925
<i>Of a new love</i>

14:15.021 --> 14:18.013
Mother wants to know why
you only went for 8 on the movies.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.473
Because my real expertise
is pain-in-the-ass in-laws.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.521
- Now would you get off the phone?
- I'm not gonna start with this.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.773
<i>Tell him that everybody</i>
<i>is watching that show.</i>

14:24.864 --> 14:26.274
Steve Allen is gettin' a busy signal

14:26.366 --> 14:27.822
because my mother-in-law
won't shut up.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.274
- Look, Ma, I got...
<i>...drops dead,</i>

14:29.285 --> 14:30.866
<i>- and I don't want to have to deal with it.</i>
- I gotta go.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.284
- All right. Goodbye.
<i>- Call me before you go to bed.</i>

14:32.288 --> 14:33.494
<i>That's all I'm sayin'.</i>

14:33.956 --> 14:37.699
What are you doin'? My father
paid good money for this suit.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.204
He wore it to his own funeral.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.377
You make it sound like
it was the suit that killed him.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.546
You wanna know why Enright
makes me wear that suit?

14:43.633 --> 14:45.169
Because it makes me
look like a schmuck.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.341
Yeah, well, stop actin'
like a schmuck then.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.837
You don't get it, do you? I go out
on the street, and everybody knows me.

14:50.932 --> 14:55.642
Me. Herb Stempel. And they love me for
the same reason they used to hate me.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.636
Because I'm the guy
who knows everything.

14:57.647 --> 15:01.356
You should worship the ground I walk
on, what my family's done for you.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.691
You wanna be worshiped?
Go to India and moo.

15:03.778 --> 15:06.986
Without my family, you'd be
on that show in your underwear.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.856
Things are gonna change
around here, boy.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.324
What does that mean,
everything's gonna change?

15:12.328 --> 15:14.159
You think I should
get my teeth capped?

15:17.834 --> 15:19.540
What's gonna change, Herbert?

15:19.544 --> 15:21.751
Everything's gonna change.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.087
For us.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.167
Hey, what the hell were you thinking?

15:29.178 --> 15:32.591
Toby, that box is the biggest thing

15:32.682 --> 15:35.549
since Gutenberg
invented the printing press,

15:35.643 --> 15:37.383
and I'm the biggest thing on it.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.304
We don't need your mother
and her money anymore.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.516
Don't you wanna tell her where
to get off after 28 years?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.819
Now would you please

15:49.365 --> 15:51.572
dance with me?

15:51.659 --> 15:54.947
<i>Dancing in the dark</i>

15:55.204 --> 15:57.195
<i>Until the tune ends</i>

15:57.206 --> 16:01.575
<i>We're dancing in the dark</i>

16:01.669 --> 16:04.035
<i>And it soon ends</i>

16:04.130 --> 16:06.246
<i>We're waltzing</i>

16:06.257 --> 16:11.422
<i>In the wonder</i>
<i>of why we're here...</i>

16:11.429 --> 16:14.136
Because of a disagreement
with his commanding general,

16:14.223 --> 16:16.589
Ulysses S. Grant was virtually placed
under arrest

16:16.601 --> 16:19.559
for a brief time early in 1862.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.144
Who was the commanding general
of the Union Army at that time?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.940
Oh, I know that. Uh, Halleck.
General H.W. Halleck.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.558
That's correct.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.481
Who was Sebastian Cabot
and what country

16:29.572 --> 16:31.233
- was he in the service of?
- Hey, Terry.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.070
He was an explorer from Spain.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.776
That's correct.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.243
Who founded the former hub
of the Byzantine Empire...

16:38.247 --> 16:39.657
Who's that guy in the corner?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.740
- Constantinople?
- Constantine the First.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.000
Charles Van Doren.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.294
Charles Van Doren?
Like "Van Doren" Van Doren?

16:48.758 --> 16:51.044
- He wants to be on <i>Tic-Tac-Dough?</i>
- I guess so.

16:51.219 --> 16:54.086
- Meriwether Lewis.
- That's it.

16:54.096 --> 16:57.054
Who was the editor
of the socialist paper...

16:57.308 --> 16:59.674
Oh, this is the guy. This is the guy.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.976
<i>I got the guy</i>
<i>I got the guy</i>

17:02.104 --> 17:03.935
I got the guy!

17:06.442 --> 17:07.477
I got the guy.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.476
So I turned to astrophysics,
but of course, as you know,

17:10.570 --> 17:13.858
all the great physicists were
great before the age of 25.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.815
It just wasn't in the cards.

17:15.910 --> 17:19.493
So I went to Paris
and wrote my novel about a patricide.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.656
What?

17:20.665 --> 17:21.996
A boy who kills his father.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.829
My dad liked it quite a lot, actually,

17:25.920 --> 17:29.128
although you could fill Yankee Stadium
with the world's mediocre novelists.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.126
And your father is Carl Van Doren.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.966
My uncle. My father
is Mark Van Doren, the poet.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.342
He also teaches... I mean,
I also teach at Columbia. Literature.

17:38.349 --> 17:41.716
- Same as Dad.
- Oh, same as Dad, huh? That's nice.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.676
Could I ask you
a personal question, Professor?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.807
Actually, I'm not a professor yet.
I'm just an instructor.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.896
How much do they pay instructors
up at Columbia?

17:48.359 --> 17:49.849
Eighty-six dollars a week.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.809
You have any idea how much
Bozo the Clown makes?

17:51.904 --> 17:54.145
Well, we can't all be Bozo the Clown.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.856
No, no, not to question
your choice of profession. Not at all.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.075
I'm questioning the values of a society
that pays somebody like you...

18:00.162 --> 18:01.527
- What was it?
- Eighty-six dollars a week.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.580
Eighty-six dollars a week. You plan
on raising a family, right, Professor?

18:04.667 --> 18:05.873
- Yes, I hope to, very much.
- Can you imagine

18:05.960 --> 18:07.200
raising a family on 86 dollars a week?

18:07.211 --> 18:08.371
Eighty-six dollars a week.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.041
And meanwhile, look at the crisis
of education in this country.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.790
Well, yes, I agree.
It's a national problem.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.508
So I understand you came down
to try out for <i>Tic-Tac-Dough.</i>

18:16.596 --> 18:19.508
Well, my friends tell me I have
a good mind for this sort of thing.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.714
They coaxed me...

18:20.725 --> 18:22.340
How'd you like to be on <i>Twenty-One?</i>

18:24.520 --> 18:26.681
<i>- Twenty-One?</i>
- Dan produces both shows.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.013
You're young, you're clean-cut,
you're from a prominent family.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.266
Kids would run to do their homework
to be like Charles Van Doren.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.442
- What about Herbert Stempel?
- What about him?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.110
Herb? Oh, I love him.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.562
- People don't like him.
- Well, we love Herb.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.443
- Kids don't look up to him.
- If you were a kid,

18:38.534 --> 18:41.071
would you want to be an annoying
Jewish guy with a sidewall haircut?

18:41.162 --> 18:44.950
- Well, I wanted to be Joe DiMaggio.
- Oh, yeah? Me, too.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.077
- Especially after he signed for 100,000.
- Yeah, Al...

18:47.168 --> 18:50.126
But you see, that's what this country
needs, is an intellectual Joe DiMaggio,

18:50.212 --> 18:52.123
with the women and the money
and all of it,

18:52.214 --> 18:53.920
but from his brain
instead of a bat and ball.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.590
- Dan.
- I know. You're probably right.

18:56.677 --> 19:00.169
Yeah, boy.
What are we gonna do here?

19:02.058 --> 19:03.514
Well, I could take a whack at it.

19:08.439 --> 19:13.399
Yeah, see, the problem, Professor, is
the old college try ain't gonna do it.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.228
And you've seen Stempel.
The guy's unbeatable.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.779
I have to admit <i>Tic-Tac-Dough</i>
seemed more feasible.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.738
What if we were to put you
on the show...

19:22.745 --> 19:25.236
Put you on <i>Twenty-One</i> and ask
you questions that you know.

19:25.247 --> 19:30.116
Say, the questions that he answered
correctly on the test this morning.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.747
- I don't follow you.
- Just thinkin' out loud.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.497
I thought the questions
were in a bank vault.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.923
- In a way, they are.
- You wanna win, don't you?

19:38.803 --> 19:41.340
Well, I think I'd really rather
try to beat him honestly.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.419
What's dishonest?

19:42.515 --> 19:44.346
When Gregory Peck parachutes
behind enemy lines,

19:44.433 --> 19:45.764
do you think that's really Gregory Peck?

19:45.851 --> 19:48.467
That book that Eisenhower wrote?
A ghostwriter wrote it. Nobody cares.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.018
It's not like we'd be
giving you the answers.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.937
Just 'cause we know you know,
you still know.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.102
Right. It's not like you're putting me
on the show, or Al,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.184
and pretending to be
some sort of intellectual.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.940
You have put in years of study
and erudition.

19:59.031 --> 20:03.195
I mean, I'm just trying to imagine
what Kant would make of this.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.034
I don't think he'd have a problem with it.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.659
Think about what this could mean
for the cause of education.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.661
Forty million people
will watch you on <i>Twenty-One.</i>

20:11.669 --> 20:14.456
It's not like anybody
has to know. Just us three.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.134
It just doesn't seem right.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.717
I'd have to say no.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.603
Just an idea.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.641
Was that part of the test?

20:48.497 --> 20:50.203
- So we're okay.
- You're gonna give it a try.

20:50.207 --> 20:54.325
Well, I just want to make sure
it'll be, you know, not

20:54.336 --> 20:56.247
the way we discussed it before?

20:56.338 --> 20:59.705
- No. So pure, it floats.
- Not at all.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.753
Okay? So we'll see you
Monday night then.

21:01.844 --> 21:02.879
You'll come by
and see how the show works.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.050
Great.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.760
- All right. And we'll look forward to that.
- Monday night.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.429
- N ice meeting you.
- Okay. Goodbye.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.507
- Take care.
- Bye-bye.

21:11.729 --> 21:15.221
- Reservations are at 9:00.
- Thanks. All right.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.935
Boys.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.516
- H i, Jack.
- H i, Jack.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.853
- Who's that?
- That's Charles Van Doren.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.447
- As in "Van Doren" Van Doren?
- Van Doren. Yes.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.446
He wants to be on <i>Tic-Tac-Dough.</i>

21:29.705 --> 21:33.448
Now, why would a guy like that
want to be on a quiz show?

21:35.878 --> 21:39.746
<i>Richard Goodwin. I'm an investigator.</i>

21:39.757 --> 21:40.746
<i>An investigator.</i>

21:40.841 --> 21:42.206
Richard Goodwin
with the Subcommittee

21:42.301 --> 21:44.087
on Legislative Oversight.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.635
I'm calling because the rate schedules
for the Baltimore and Ohio

21:46.722 --> 21:48.428
for the first four months of 1954

21:48.516 --> 21:50.757
seem to be missing
from the documents you just sent me.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.263
Oh, go get 'em, Dickie.
They're sweatin' now.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.390
Do they know you were first in
your class at Harvard Law School?

21:55.397 --> 21:56.603
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

21:56.607 --> 21:57.892
I was first in my class
at Harvard Law School.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.562
- There we go. What have you got?
- Forty-three seconds.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.439
- Not bad.
- Railroad regulation.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.607
Now that's political dynamite
he's playing with.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.401
Oh, just an oversight.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.608
- We're an oversight committee.
- Right.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.567
The end of next week.
That'll be just fine.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.574
And I'll send you a little
helpful reminder, okay?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.906
You'll notice it 'cause it'll look
very much like a subpoena.

22:14.917 --> 22:15.952
Oh!

22:16.043 --> 22:17.453
Thank you.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.410
You know, Dick, you stick with this...
I don't know.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.501
Ten, fifteen years,

22:20.589 --> 22:23.080
you could bring the Interstate
Commerce Commission to its knees.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.133
Of course, by then,
there may not be railroads.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.965
You'll still be sittin' right there, too, Alex.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.259
- He's so sensitive.
- Truce.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.807
<i>Herb, you got ten points.</i>

22:33.811 --> 22:36.928
<i>The category is "Explorers."</i>
<i>How many you want to try for?</i>

22:38.357 --> 22:41.144
- <i>I'll try for 11 points, Mr. Barry.</i>
- Hello!

22:41.151 --> 22:43.517
<i>Gonna go all the way, huh?</i>
<i>All right.</i>

22:43.612 --> 22:45.273
<i>I'm gonna name four spots</i>
<i>on the globe.</i>

22:45.281 --> 22:47.522
<i>You name the explorer</i>
<i>who discovered them.</i>

22:47.616 --> 22:50.779
<i>- First, Newfoundland.</i>
- John Cabot.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.328
Hi. I see you're really churning out
the chapters today.

22:54.331 --> 22:57.038
Go away. No cigar in the bedroom.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.866
<i>- That's correct.</i>
- Out.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.371
<i>The Cape of Good Hope.</i>

23:00.462 --> 23:03.044
No cigar in the bedroom.
We allow a television in the bedroom,

23:03.132 --> 23:05.293
but no cigar in the bedroom.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.508
- This...
- <i>Bartolomeu Dias.</i>

23:07.595 --> 23:09.881
<i>- He originally called it...</i>
<i>- You're right, Herb.</i>

23:09.972 --> 23:13.556
So today, chairman calls me aside.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.633
My big break, right?

23:15.728 --> 23:17.013
He asks me to write him a speech

23:17.104 --> 23:20.813
to deliver to the Kiwanis Club
of Arkadelphia, Arkansas.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.812
You're good at that.
Gee, do we get to go there?

23:23.819 --> 23:27.653
Yeah. Just like to know
where the challenge is.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.482
You know? I feel like a race horse
whose gate won't open.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.325
You didn't want the Wall Street job.

23:33.412 --> 23:37.030
Yeah, I know.
Well, money isn't everything.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.999
I'm not the one who came home
with the Chrysler catalog.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.577
<i>Give me the name of the explorer</i>
<i>who discovered Mozambique.</i>

23:43.672 --> 23:47.335
- Vasco da Gama.
- Vasco da Gama.

23:47.343 --> 23:51.052
- <i>Well...</i>
- Maybe I should get on a quiz show.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.845
At least I could get in my own bedroom.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.841
It's just a job, Dick. It's not sex.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.016
<i>Vasco da Gama?</i>

24:01.023 --> 24:03.389
- Great show, Herbie.
- Terrific show. I really think so.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.016
- Jack, wasn't Herb terrific tonight?
- Can't you see I'm busy, Dan?

24:06.111 --> 24:07.897
- Okay.
- Oh, Herb, I'd like you to meet

24:07.905 --> 24:09.861
next week's challenger,
Charles Van Doren.

24:09.949 --> 24:14.283
Hello. I'm scared of you.
Boy, oh, boy, let me tell you.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.860
Scared of me?

24:24.672 --> 24:27.664
- More wine, Herb?
- Thank you, Dan. Why not?

24:32.304 --> 24:34.716
You've earned it. How's that steak?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.388
Nothing like a fine piece of meat.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.217
You know, Herb, it's a hell of a thing.
I'm lookin' at the thing today.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.303
- You know, the Trendex rating?
- Yeah?

24:42.398 --> 24:45.390
Well, it's the damndest thing,
but you've plateaued.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.276
Plateaued? What kind of word is that?

24:49.863 --> 24:51.228
- What, plateaued?
- Plateaued.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.405
Plateaued? Well, it's like you...

24:53.409 --> 24:54.740
You mean people
don't like me anymore?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.613
No, no, no, it's not you per se.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.569
- It's just... No, it's...
- Maybe I should get my teeth capped.

24:58.664 --> 24:59.653
It's the nature of the show.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.739
They've already seen you win,
and they want something new.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.913
So what are you saying?
You think they want me to lose?

25:05.004 --> 25:07.086
Well, don't you think that's natural?

25:07.172 --> 25:10.790
Joe Louis was the champ for 12 years.
Nobody ever wanted Joe Louis to lose.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.216
- Think about the cause of education.
- The cause of education?

25:14.388 --> 25:16.504
I waited 29 years for this.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.806
Now I'm supposed to take a dive
for the cause of education?

25:19.893 --> 25:22.805
I didn't say take a dive.
Now I'm askin' you for your help.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.137
Fine. Just let me play it honestly.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.597
Will you keep your voice down?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.353
Go ahead. Give me a number.
Give me a number.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.268
Excuse me, sir.
Give me a number, a random number.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.819
I don't know. Twenty-three?

25:32.906 --> 25:34.988
Beethoven was 23 when he
composed his first piano sonata.

25:35.451 --> 25:39.990
In 1923, Jack Bentley set the record
for average by a pitcher, batting.427.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.365
There are 23 chromosomes

25:41.457 --> 25:42.822
- in the human egg.
- Herb...

25:42.833 --> 25:45.950
Also, the human sperm. Twenty-third
president, Benjamin Harrison.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.701
Asian countries along
the 23rd parallel...

25:47.796 --> 25:49.377
Look, don't start believing
your own bullshit, all right?

25:49.465 --> 25:50.625
You wouldn't know the name of
Paul Revere's horse

25:50.716 --> 25:51.796
if he took a crap on your lawn.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.000
- She.
- What?

25:54.094 --> 25:57.678
- It was a mare, remember?
- Look, you lose when I tell you to lose.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.346
- But why now?
- It's an arrangement.

25:59.433 --> 26:02.220
- It's always been an arrangement.
- But if you told me to lose before,

26:02.311 --> 26:04.802
if you told me to lose right from
the beginning, that I'd understand.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.351
That'd be the story of my life.
But why now? What did I do?

26:08.442 --> 26:12.355
Look at the big picture. It's not like
television is gonna go away, you know.

26:12.446 --> 26:15.984
- I mean, think about the future.
- You mean like a panel show?

26:16.533 --> 26:19.525
Check. Look, I'm gonna do
what I can do, Herb.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.157
But meanwhile, maybe you could use
somebody to talk to.

26:22.164 --> 26:25.702
I'm gonna give you the name
of my analyst. Just send me the bills.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.166
You know, I could be terrific
on one of those panel shows.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.333
Here you go, sir.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.878
Witty, off-the-cuff.
A Bill Cullen sort of thing.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.206
Now the last category is movies.

26:34.218 --> 26:35.879
We're gonna ask you
what won the Academy Award

26:35.969 --> 26:37.880
for Best Picture in 1955.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.254
You don't know it.
You answer <i>On The Waterfront.</i>

26:41.934 --> 26:44.550
Oh, no. Oh, no. Don't... Don't do that.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.724
Not <i>Marty.</i> I saw <i>Marty</i> three times.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.598
The Best Picture from two years ago
and I don't know it?

26:50.692 --> 26:52.853
Someone of your intellect,
and it's such a simple question.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.903
- Don't you see the drama of that?
- Drama?

26:55.989 --> 26:58.355
Herb, don't do this to yourself.

26:58.742 --> 27:02.109
Please, let me lose on
a physics question, not <i>Marty,</i> Dan.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.029
Don't do this to me. It's too humiliating.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.208
For 70 grand, Herb, you can afford
to be humiliated.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.930
Who was the captain of the <i>Mayflower?</i>

27:23.934 --> 27:25.049
Christopher Jones.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.975
- What year?
- 1620.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.223
<i>Here's Mr. Moto!</i>

27:29.314 --> 27:31.396
<i>And we'll return to Mr. Moto after this.</i>

27:31.984 --> 27:34.316
<i>Will Herbert Stempel</i>
<i>become the first man</i>

27:34.403 --> 27:37.315
<i>to win over $ 100,000 on television?</i>

27:37.406 --> 27:40.273
No, Herbert Stempel is not
going to win over $ 100,000.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.403
Herbert Stempel
is going to take a dive!

27:42.411 --> 27:45.118
Dad, the quiz is tomorrow.
If you're gonna talk to the TV...

27:45.122 --> 27:47.784
All right, big shot. So who bought
Manhattan Island from the Indians?

27:47.791 --> 27:48.780
Peter Minuit.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.616
- What year?
- 1626.

27:50.711 --> 27:52.576
- How much?
- Twenty-four dollars.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.413
<i>...this week on Twenty-One.</i>

27:55.924 --> 27:58.256
<i>- Now back to our program.</i>
- This week on <i>Twenty-One,</i>

27:58.260 --> 28:00.797
watch Herb Stempel be fed
to the Columbia Lions.

28:00.804 --> 28:05.798
Watch Charles Van Doren eat his
first kosher meal on <i>Twenty-One.</i>

28:05.893 --> 28:09.306
What are you doing?
Why aren't you dressed?

28:09.396 --> 28:10.476
The child has to learn.

28:11.106 --> 28:14.314
The child has to learn the depths
that humanity can sink to.

28:14.318 --> 28:17.151
The tribes of
the Iroquois League, Mohawks,

28:17.154 --> 28:18.860
- Cayugas, Oneidas...
- Twenty-four bucks for Manhattan.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.312
First the Indians, then us.

28:20.324 --> 28:23.191
- What's eatin' you?
- You know why they call them Indians?

28:23.285 --> 28:24.320
Because Columbus

28:24.328 --> 28:25.363
- thought he was in India.
- Mohawks, Cayugas...

28:25.454 --> 28:27.945
They're Indians because
some white guy got lost.

28:27.956 --> 28:31.119
You're gonna give him your ulcer.
Let him grow up with his own ulcer.

28:31.126 --> 28:34.664
- He wouldn't let me practice my drums.
- Who won Best Picture for 1955?

28:34.755 --> 28:36.620
- <i>Marty.</i>
- Thank you.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.457
- Well, what's the problem?
- Lester, do me a favor.

28:39.468 --> 28:42.801
Go in your bedroom, do your homework,
all right? Hey, hey!

28:43.805 --> 28:45.295
With your books.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.056
Homework with your books.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.564
- They want me to take a dive.
- What?

28:56.485 --> 29:00.353
They're going to ask me
what won the Best Picture for 1955,

29:00.364 --> 29:03.356
and I have to answer
<i>On The Waterfront.</i>

29:03.450 --> 29:06.988
They have to <i>utz</i> me with a question
any child knows.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.532
How can they do that? I thought
the questions were in a bank vault.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.500
They just put me in an isolation booth
and pump cyanide into it.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.578
Herbie, they can't do that.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.880
- How can they do that?
- Well, obviously, Toby,

29:19.883 --> 29:23.000
this particular question
isn't in the bank vault.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.170
- Why?
- How the hell do I know why?

29:28.892 --> 29:31.554
Well, then the hell with them.
Just answer <i>Marty</i> then.

29:31.561 --> 29:35.725
- I already agreed.
- Well, screw them.

29:35.732 --> 29:39.475
Let them ask you a question you
really don't know. Good luck.

29:42.197 --> 29:47.362
You're Herbert Stempel.
What are they gonna do to you? Huh?

29:47.452 --> 29:52.287
<i>Judo chop into</i>
<i>the throat. Once again, it's a judo chop.</i>

29:52.374 --> 29:53.739
You're right. What could they do to me?

29:53.834 --> 29:55.540
Yeah.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.413
- Screw 'em.
- Yeah.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.877
Remember, call him "Jack"
as often as possible.

30:04.177 --> 30:06.543
Jack.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.091
Fifteen seconds.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.259
Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.428
Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

30:12.436 --> 30:15.519
- <i>Five.</i>
- Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

30:15.856 --> 30:18.222
- Watch your headroom.
- Coming to air in ten, nine,

30:18.233 --> 30:20.815
- eight, seven...
- I'm Jack Barry.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.233
...six, five...
- Steady, one.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.233
...four, three...
- Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.277
...two, one.
- Fade up. Cue up.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.946
Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

30:30.037 --> 30:32.653
<i>So let's meet our</i>
<i>first two players as Geritol,</i>

30:32.748 --> 30:36.332
<i>America's #1 tonic,</i>

<i>And returning with $69, 500,</i>

30:41.590 --> 30:42.579
Van Doren?

30:42.674 --> 30:44.585
<i>...Mr. Herbert Stempel.</i>

30:44.676 --> 30:47.008
- Think that's his son?
- <i>Are you related in any way</i>

30:47.095 --> 30:48.255
<i>to Mark Van Doren</i>
<i>of Columbia University...</i>

30:48.263 --> 30:49.423
I don't know. I guess so.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.470
<i>...The famous poet and author?</i>
<i>- Yes, he's my father.</i>

30:51.558 --> 30:52.673
<i>He is your father.</i>

30:52.768 --> 30:56.010
<i>Yes, both he and my uncle Carl</i>
<i>have won the Pulitzer Prize,</i>

30:56.104 --> 30:59.346
<i>and Dorothy Van Doren, the author</i>
<i>of the recent</i> The Country Wife,

31:00.567 --> 31:03.104
<i>Okay, Herb, you know</i>
<i>something about Mr. Van Doren.</i>

31:03.195 --> 31:07.859
<i>You have $69, 500. Do you want to take</i>

31:07.949 --> 31:09.940
<i>or risk it by playing against him?</i>

31:15.665 --> 31:17.496
<i>It's a tough decision, I know.</i>

31:19.669 --> 31:21.205
<i>- What'll it be?</i>
<i>- I'll take a chance.</i>

31:21.296 --> 31:23.207
<i>You will take a chance. All right,</i>
<i>then, here we go, gentlemen.</i>

31:23.298 --> 31:26.665
You sure Herbie's on board with this?

31:27.010 --> 31:28.796
Can I take the third part last?

31:29.971 --> 31:34.055
I guess that Atahualpa was the leader
of the Incas at the time of the conquest.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.975
- Correct.
- Wouldn't that be William Allen White?

31:36.978 --> 31:39.640
- That's correct.
- I'd like to take the third part last.

31:39.648 --> 31:43.186
His fourth wife was Anne of Cleves.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.483
He divorced Catherine of Aragon.

31:45.570 --> 31:49.154
- He divorced her.
- He beheaded Anne Boleyn.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.027
Well, they all died.

31:51.118 --> 31:54.451
<i>Herb Stempel leads at this point</i>
<i>by 18 to 10.</i>

31:54.663 --> 31:56.995
<i>- Herb?</i>
<i>- Yes, Mr. Barry?</i>

31:56.998 --> 32:00.741
The category is "Movies."
How many points you want to try for?

32:00.836 --> 32:03.873
I'll try for three. Three points.

32:03.880 --> 32:09.420
<i>Which motion picture</i>
<i>won the Academy Award for 1955?</i>

32:15.684 --> 32:17.094
<i>Marty.</i>

32:26.361 --> 32:28.898
Best Picture.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.530
<i>Marty.</i>

32:32.784 --> 32:34.149
<i>Best Picture.</i>

32:36.121 --> 32:37.702
<i>Marty.</i>

32:42.961 --> 32:44.201
He doesn't know it?

32:46.715 --> 32:50.048
<i>All right, Herb,</i>
<i>I'll tell you when your time is up.</i>

32:56.600 --> 32:59.717
I don't remember. I don't remember.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.388
<i>Are you sure you wouldn't want</i>
<i>to guess at it, Herb?</i>

33:04.483 --> 33:06.474
<i>- Otherwise, I'll have to call it wrong.</i>
<i>- Wait.</i>

33:08.320 --> 33:09.309
<i>Marty.</i>

33:13.492 --> 33:16.029
<i>Your time is up, Herb.</i>
<i>I'll need your answer.</i>

33:17.370 --> 33:19.201
Best Picture...

33:20.749 --> 33:23.741
...of 1955...

33:23.835 --> 33:25.325
<i>On The Waterfront?</i>

33:27.297 --> 33:30.084
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>The answer is</i> Marty.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.926
Marty. <i>It was</i> Marty
<i>that won the Academy Award</i>

33:38.934 --> 33:41.892
<i>for Best Picture in 1955.</i>

33:42.938 --> 33:46.101
<i>- Marty was Ernest Borgnine.</i>
- Geez, what an easy question.

33:46.358 --> 33:49.475
<i>The Academy Award for 1955.</i>
<i>You lose three points.</i>

33:49.569 --> 33:53.482
<i>You go back down to 15.</i>
<i>Better luck on the next round.</i>

33:53.490 --> 33:56.232
<i>And now for you, Professor,</i>
<i>the category is...</i>

33:57.285 --> 33:59.150
Civil War.

33:59.162 --> 34:01.448
How many points you want
to try for, from 1 to 11?

34:01.915 --> 34:04.827
Civil War. That's a...
That's an awful big subject.

34:06.503 --> 34:09.791
Well, here goes nothing.
I'll... I'll try for 11.

34:10.215 --> 34:13.833
<i>Eleven points will bring you to 21,</i>
<i>and you will be our new champion!</i>

34:15.011 --> 34:17.047
Because of a disagreement
with his commanding general,

34:17.138 --> 34:19.550
Ulysses S. Grant was virtually
placed under arrest

34:19.641 --> 34:22.804
for a brief time early in 1862.

34:22.811 --> 34:26.895
Who was the commanding general
of the Union Army at that time?

34:32.987 --> 34:34.853
<i>Tough question.</i>

34:34.947 --> 34:37.234
It's just so oddly familiar.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.373
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>some more time?</i>

34:51.797 --> 34:55.255
- Whatever you can spare.
<i>- All right.</i>

35:02.684 --> 35:03.719
Do you know the name?

35:10.525 --> 35:13.688
Yes, I know his name. Halleck.
General H.W. Halleck.

35:13.695 --> 35:17.859
<i>You are our new</i>
<i>champion for $20,000!</i>

35:21.161 --> 35:24.528
<i>Come on out, Herb.</i>
<i>Come on out, Professor.</i>

35:25.540 --> 35:27.781
<i>Wasn't that somethin', folks? Huh?</i>

35:28.627 --> 35:31.209
<i>You feelin' all right?</i>

35:31.296 --> 35:34.788
Very good. Perhaps we can get
an ice pack out here for the professor.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.874
I suspect his gray matter is red-hot.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.376
I wonder if he's married.

35:39.387 --> 35:43.221
<i>Our congratulations for a wonderful</i>
<i>victory. Professor Charles Van Doren.</i>

35:43.224 --> 35:47.058
I am constantly amazed at the facts
these guys have at their fingertips.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.644
- Tough questions tonight.
- Yeah. Oh, well, not really.

35:49.731 --> 35:53.223
Wow, you were fantastic. Hey, you
better unlist your phone number.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.316
Can you believe the pressure?
Look at him, he's soakin' wet.

35:55.403 --> 35:58.065
- Is this guy a natural or what? Jesus!
- He's a natural.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.438
Do you think he's involved
with anyone?

35:59.532 --> 36:00.567
I don't know.

36:00.659 --> 36:04.277
I'm gonna miss ya, Herb. You know,
I'm really gonna miss this guy.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.243
Hey, Dan, listen,
that guy is really terrific.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.737
We could easily beat out
<i>I Love Lucy</i> with him.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.322
I know we can.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.248
Let's get a photo here.
Oh, George. Here we go.

36:11.753 --> 36:15.041
<i>Charles Van Doren. Miles Bronfman,</i>
<i>an executive here at the network.</i>

36:15.423 --> 36:16.663
Oh, there we go.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.248
So what do you think, Charlie?
You excited?

36:18.259 --> 36:20.250
- Professor, can I interrupt you?
- Charlie, I just wanted to...

36:20.261 --> 36:22.297
My son was in your father's class.

36:22.389 --> 36:23.754
- Oh, really?
- Says he's a saint.

36:23.765 --> 36:26.427
Charlie, I want you to meet
Bill Henderson. He promotes the show.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.349
- Congratulations. Sensational.
- Thank you.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.926
Now we have a clean-cut intellectual

36:29.938 --> 36:31.929
instead of a freak
with a sponge memory.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.601
See you next week, Charlie.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.519
I don't even want to think about that.
I was so nervous.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.441
Dan! Dan!

36:39.114 --> 36:41.275
So pure, it floats? Hmm?

36:41.282 --> 36:43.648
Are you kidding? It was great.

36:43.743 --> 36:46.109
Go home and have a martini.
We'll talk in the morning.

36:46.871 --> 36:49.203
Uh, I'm gonna take the stairs.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.873
- How did you know he'd go for it?
- What would you do?

37:00.927 --> 37:03.464
Meanwhile, it's okay
if you know the answer.

37:03.555 --> 37:06.342
Yeah, so it's... My God, it's not like
I haven't worked hard.

37:06.433 --> 37:09.300
I deserve $20,000
as much as anybody.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.350
My God! $20,000.

37:18.111 --> 37:21.569
The highest navigable lake
in the world is,

37:21.656 --> 37:24.318
- Lake Titicaca.
- Lake Titicaca.

37:24.325 --> 37:27.817
- That'd have to be Lake Titicaca.
- Correct for ten points!

37:29.164 --> 37:32.531
Michel Montaigne. Around his neck,

37:32.625 --> 37:36.493
Montaigne wore a medallion
which read, "What do I know?"

37:36.504 --> 37:38.870
Hello. This is Herb Stempel
calling for Mr. Enright.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.497
<i>I'm terribly sorry. He's not in.</i>

37:40.508 --> 37:43.420
<i>Our current reigning champion,</i>
<i>from New York, New York,</i>

37:43.511 --> 37:45.342
<i>Mr. Charles Van Doren.</i>

37:47.056 --> 37:50.514
<i>... twenty-four hours,</i>
<i>Geritol liquid, or now, in new...</i>

37:50.602 --> 37:54.186
It's the only town house
available in the Village.

37:56.149 --> 37:57.480
I'll take it.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.933
<i>Will do. It's just that</i>
<i>he's out of the office right now...</i>

38:00.028 --> 38:01.393
This is Herb Stempel.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.695
This is about the 17th time
I've called.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.905
I guess William Pitt, the Elder.

38:05.909 --> 38:07.194
You have 21!

38:09.954 --> 38:12.570
Come to me, Charlie. Good. Smile.
Hold the bag right there.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.201
Hold it right there. Good.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.748
<i>Here, Professor Van Doren turns in</i>

38:15.752 --> 38:17.458
<i>the evidence of his amazing popularity,</i>

38:17.545 --> 38:20.207
<i>thousands of letters a week</i>
<i>for the egghead turned national hero.</i>

38:20.298 --> 38:22.380
<i>Winnings to date, $50,000!</i>

38:22.467 --> 38:25.209
<i>Hey, Charlie! The check's in the mail.</i>

38:25.220 --> 38:27.211
- Is Mr. Enright in?
<i>- I'm sorry. He's not right now.</i>

38:27.222 --> 38:28.803
This is Herb Stempel. You tell him that

38:28.890 --> 38:30.630
he promised that
he would call me back,

38:30.725 --> 38:32.716
and if he doesn't,
something is going to happen.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.926
- Do you understand that?
<i>- I understand.</i>

38:34.020 --> 38:35.976
That's right. Okay, bye.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.899
You just tell Mr. Enright
that if he doesn't want to talk to me,

38:45.990 --> 38:47.651
maybe the district attorney
would like to talk to me.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.232
If he wants to play hardball,
I'll play hardball.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.407
<i>Very well.</i>

38:50.495 --> 38:53.282
- Good morning, Mr. Van Doren.
- Hello.

39:08.137 --> 39:10.469
<i>And returning with $83,000,</i>

39:10.473 --> 39:13.965
<i>our champion, after seven weeks,</i>
<i>Charles Van Doren.</i>

39:15.562 --> 39:16.642
<i>Welcome to</i> Twenty-One, <i>gentlemen.</i>

39:16.771 --> 39:19.103
- <i>Evening, Jack.</i>
<i>- Charlie...</i>

39:20.567 --> 39:23.104
Gentlemen, please.

39:27.782 --> 39:32.196
It was a totally humiliating experience.
All my friends knew that I loved <i>Marty.</i>

39:32.287 --> 39:34.198
It's one of my favorite films.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.746
I saw it three times.
It's about a boy in the Bronx...

39:40.920 --> 39:43.127
Mr. Enright will see you now.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.634
Have a seat, Herb.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.473
Thanks for comin' up.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.846
I feel we have some unfinished
business we need to hash out.

40:01.941 --> 40:04.148
I have some unfinished
business with you, too.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.692
This whole thing with the grand jury
and the things you said,

40:06.779 --> 40:09.145
well, they hurt me.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.902
I can't tell you how...
Well, they hurt me deeply.

40:11.993 --> 40:15.156
- I told the truth.
- There you go again.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.828
You promised me, Dan.
You promised that you'd help me out.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.744
Don't you think that I want to
help you more than I already have?

40:20.835 --> 40:22.541
But the point is,
you've made it impossible.

40:22.629 --> 40:23.664
Look, you want me to apologize?

40:23.755 --> 40:26.747
- I want you to sign this statement.
- I apologize.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.502
What kind of statement?

40:28.843 --> 40:31.004
It clears me and the show
of any wrongdoing.

40:31.387 --> 40:35.175
- What about the panel show?
- See? That's a perfect example.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.509
I told you I'd do what I could,
and I did. I put your name on a list.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.890
You put me on a list? That's it?

40:42.065 --> 40:44.772
N BC owns our company.
Everything goes through them.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.568
N BC bought your company
for two million bucks. What about me?

40:48.571 --> 40:51.529
People watched me on that show.
Look. Look. Look at this.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.356
- Oh, Herb, don't start...
- "He has become a friend

40:53.368 --> 40:55.199
"in over 50 million homes,

40:55.203 --> 40:58.866
"whose weekly visits the whole family
eagerly anticipates."

40:58.873 --> 41:02.411
- I was a friend, too, in 50 million homes.
- Look, what can I tell you, Herb?

41:02.418 --> 41:04.784
- Life is unfair.
- Life is unfair to me.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.086
Life's not unfair to Charles Van Doren.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.038
Remember how he snubbed me
after the show?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.122
There'll be other shows.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.381
What other shows?
I need the money, Dan.

41:13.388 --> 41:16.755
What?
How could you need the money?

41:16.849 --> 41:19.716
It's gone. I mean it's invested.
It's tied up. It's...

41:19.727 --> 41:23.219
- Well, can't you talk to your broker?
- He's not a broker.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.305
He's more of a bookmaker.
It's seed money.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.358
He's setting up in Florida right now.
He says it's the next growth area.

41:28.778 --> 41:31.736
You gave your money
to a bookie who skipped town?

41:31.823 --> 41:35.315
I want what I have coming, Dan.
I have to get back on television.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.026
- Herb, I'm gonna...
- Show me this list. Where's this list?

41:38.204 --> 41:41.162
I submitted a list of 45 names.

41:41.249 --> 41:43.160
They rejected three.
You were one of them.

41:44.377 --> 41:47.164
That big uncircumcised putz is
on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine,

41:47.255 --> 41:49.621
and I can't even make
the top 42 for a panel show.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.590
Look, maybe you could warm up
the audience before the show.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.760
- I could throw you 50 bucks a week.
- Fifty bucks a week?

41:55.763 --> 41:57.628
That should be me
on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

41:57.724 --> 42:00.466
- Shit, Herb, just sign the statement.
- Charles Van Doren.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.967
He wouldn't know the answer to
a doorbell if you didn't give it to him.

42:02.979 --> 42:05.015
Sign the statement,
and get on with your life!

42:05.106 --> 42:07.973
Sign the statement, Herb. Sign
the statement. Who cares if it's true?

42:07.984 --> 42:10.851
- I'm giving you a chance.
- You promised me!

42:10.945 --> 42:12.151
You get me that panel show,

42:12.238 --> 42:15.150
or I'm gonna bring you down with me,
ya lousy, lyin' prick!

42:15.241 --> 42:17.607
- You and Charles Van fuckin' Doren!
- No, you're not.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.988
I'll just tell everyone that it's a fraud.
That'll warm 'em up.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.286
"The fix is in,
this week on <i>Twenty-One."</i>

42:22.373 --> 42:23.453
When's my next appointment?

42:23.458 --> 42:26.825
The cover of <i>Time?</i> His mug shot
will be on the cover of <i>Time!</i>

42:30.298 --> 42:32.960
What the hell happened?

42:33.051 --> 42:34.416
<i>Oy.</i>

42:35.219 --> 42:37.631
<i>Why am I the only one</i>
<i>workin' this mornin'?</i>

42:37.722 --> 42:39.132
<i>You got here earlier, Mooie.</i>

42:39.223 --> 42:42.215
"Demonstrators stoned
Vice President Nixon's motorcade

42:42.310 --> 42:43.299
"as it proceeded through Caracas."

42:43.936 --> 42:46.302
Gee, Dick, what's the
<i>New York Times</i> say? Same thing?

42:46.397 --> 42:47.477
Generally.

42:47.482 --> 42:50.974
Most people who live in Washington
settle for the Washington papers.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.809
Well, the <i>Times</i>
is the paper of record.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.644
- Ah.
- Ooh.

42:55.281 --> 42:57.863
Dick hopes someday to be confused
with an important person.

42:57.992 --> 43:01.155
"Although the crowd was cordoned off
at a distance of a hundred yards,

43:01.245 --> 43:05.830
"an unidentified Venezuelan struck
Nixon in the head with a thrown onion."

43:07.001 --> 43:08.161
The Senators should sign this guy.

43:08.252 --> 43:11.039
Did you guys know there was a grand
jury in New York on the quiz shows?

43:11.047 --> 43:12.583
Jim Lemon can't even hit
the cutoff man.

43:12.673 --> 43:14.664
This guy throws a 300-foot strike
with an onion.

43:14.675 --> 43:17.712
- Have they come up with anything?
- They sealed the presentment.

43:17.804 --> 43:20.261
- That's a no.
- Why do you say that?

43:20.348 --> 43:21.838
A presentment's
a statement of findings.

43:21.933 --> 43:25.346
If there were anything in it, they'd want
to release it to the public, right?

43:25.353 --> 43:28.845
If the purpose is to make findings
public, then why keep it a secret?

43:32.693 --> 43:35.901
<i>Why seal</i>
<i>the presentment? It's illogical.</i>

43:35.905 --> 43:38.237
- It's a local matter.
- It's television.

43:38.324 --> 43:41.532
Whoa. TV.

43:41.536 --> 43:42.901
It's under our jurisdiction, right?

43:42.995 --> 43:44.701
I mean, we have oversight
over all the agencies.

43:44.789 --> 43:45.949
It includes the F.C.C.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.372
You're gonna investigate
a dead investigation?

43:48.459 --> 43:52.452
We're gonna put television
on trial. Television.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.458
Everybody in the country'll
know about it.

43:57.718 --> 44:01.210
- What do you have?
- There's somethin' there.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.047
Mr. Chairman, I'll find it.

44:05.726 --> 44:09.093
The networks,
pharmaceutical industry?

44:09.188 --> 44:11.930
Cosmetics?

44:11.941 --> 44:15.149
That's big game, son.
You don't go huntin' in your underwear.

44:15.236 --> 44:19.650
Sir, I smell somethin'. At least give
me a chance to see what I can dig up.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.731
Let me go up to New York.

44:22.201 --> 44:25.068
<i>This isn't some junket</i>
<i>for you to stay in a hotel</i>

44:25.079 --> 44:26.364
<i>and see a Broadway show.</i>

44:26.747 --> 44:30.740
<i>I'm givin' you exactly one week</i>
<i>to find something. You get that?</i>

44:31.544 --> 44:35.913
Unseal a presentment. I don't know.

44:35.923 --> 44:39.632
I don't know how
you go about that. I've never...

44:39.635 --> 44:43.093
Oh, here you go. Look at this.

44:43.181 --> 44:47.140
Hasn't been a presentment under seal
in the State of New York since 1869.

44:47.226 --> 44:48.591
That explains it.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.810
- 1869?
- Yeah.

44:51.606 --> 44:55.519
Counselor, I've reviewed in detail
the material submitted in your request.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.601
A man's reputation
is coin of the realm to him.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.107
I sealed this presentment

45:00.114 --> 45:03.026
to protect the reputations
of those unfairly implicated

45:03.117 --> 45:06.701
by a certain mentally
unstable finger-pointer.

45:06.787 --> 45:11.030
That interest, along with
important issues of federalism,

45:11.292 --> 45:14.125
dictate that I reject your committee's
request at this time.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.510
Mr. Enright's office. Mr. Enright?

45:24.972 --> 45:26.803
It's Judge Schweitzer.

45:43.032 --> 45:44.818
- Yes?
- H i. Miss Mitchell?

45:44.909 --> 45:46.524
- Uh-huh.
- My name is Richard Goodwin.

45:46.535 --> 45:49.322
I'm with the Congressional
Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight.

45:49.330 --> 45:52.197
We've been investigating
the quiz shows recently.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.869
I was wondering
if I could ask you a quick question.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.325
<i>Oh! I've got people.</i>

45:56.837 --> 45:58.668
Could I just have
a moment of your time?

45:58.756 --> 45:59.871
No.

45:59.966 --> 46:03.083
I was curious how many
episodes you appeared on.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.008
- Not very many. No.
- How...

46:05.012 --> 46:06.001
Three weeks.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.088
Did anyone ever ask you
not to talk to anyone?

46:12.061 --> 46:14.393
The Today Show
<i>with Dave Garroway,</i>

46:14.480 --> 46:17.563
<i>and Dave's regular co-host,</i>
<i>Mr. J. Fred Muggs.</i>

46:17.650 --> 46:20.392
<i>Dave's guests this morning are,</i>
<i>the Aga Khan,</i>

46:20.486 --> 46:23.398
<i>Lyle Goodhue, inventor</i>
<i>of the aerosol spray can,</i>

46:23.489 --> 46:26.572
<i>and quiz champion</i>
<i>Charles Van Doren.</i>

46:26.575 --> 46:29.237
Take a look at that.
Look at that. You see that?

46:29.328 --> 46:31.569
Yes. Uh-huh.

46:31.580 --> 46:34.367
Well, you have that conversation,
and I'm gonna begin the show.

46:34.375 --> 46:36.582
I'll see you, Mr. Muggs.

46:36.669 --> 46:39.411
Good morning.

46:39.505 --> 46:41.245
- And good morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, Dave.

46:41.257 --> 46:43.418
- How are you this morning?
- I'm fine, thank you.

46:43.509 --> 46:47.548
I see we have an unusually
large crowd outside there this morning.

46:47.638 --> 46:50.220
- So how long has it been now, Charlie?
- It's been nine weeks now.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.636
- And you've won how much?
- $93,000.

46:52.727 --> 46:55.560
- H mm, so that's $ 10,000 a week.
- That's right.

46:55.646 --> 46:58.433
Although last week, I know you were
preempted for another program.

46:58.441 --> 47:02.150
Well, that's the problem with television.
The pay's good, but it's not that steady.

47:02.486 --> 47:05.603
Don't remind me. I'm up for renewal.

47:05.698 --> 47:07.404
So tell us about the book
you're working on.

47:07.491 --> 47:09.447
Well, it's called <i>Lincoln's Commando,</i>

47:09.452 --> 47:12.068
and I hope people will find it
as interesting as I do.

47:12.163 --> 47:14.404
How do you think Honest Abe
would do on a quiz show?

47:16.125 --> 47:18.332
- Honest Abe?
- Yeah.

47:18.419 --> 47:20.410
Well, I think he'd do very well.

47:20.421 --> 47:23.413
And, of course, on a show like this,
he'd be wonderful.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.247
I'm sure he would.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.427
Here we are, Professor.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.187
Yeah, I'm just...
I just have to tie my shoe.

48:00.753 --> 48:02.869
- Hi, Mr. Van Doren.
- Hey, Mr. Van Doren.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.329
- Oh!
- Hey!

48:08.761 --> 48:10.843
- Oh!
- Good morning. H i.

48:10.846 --> 48:12.962
- Good morning, Mr. Van Doren.
- Good morning.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.218
- Where's the monkey?
- I saw you on TV this morning.

48:15.309 --> 48:18.847
Is Thomas Merton Episcopalian
or Catholic?

48:18.854 --> 48:20.435
Catholic.

48:21.690 --> 48:24.147
Hello. Are you here for office hours?

48:24.693 --> 48:27.309
Oh, no. I'm Richard Goodwin.

48:27.321 --> 48:30.028
- Did Clark Byse call?
- Clark Byse? No, he didn't.

48:30.116 --> 48:32.357
See, I'm up from Washington.
He suggested I might look you up.

48:32.451 --> 48:35.614
- You're not a stockbroker, are you?
- Lawyer, which is bad enough.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.871
- Professor Byse taught me Contracts.
- Then we have something in common.

48:38.874 --> 48:40.410
He taught me my backhand.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.662
I'm with the House Subcommittee
on Legislative Oversight.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.001
I've been swarmed by
stockbrokers lately.

48:44.088 --> 48:46.830
I feel like a girl with a bad reputation.

48:46.841 --> 48:49.799
The Committee has jurisdiction
over television.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.469
I'm sorry. Please have a seat.

48:54.723 --> 48:56.429
Thank you.

48:59.186 --> 49:03.680
You must have done very well
at Harvard. Clark doesn't like anyone.

49:03.691 --> 49:05.682
I was, uh, actually first in my class.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.858
- You make it sound like an affliction.
- Well...

49:07.945 --> 49:09.025
Did you clerk?

49:09.029 --> 49:10.439
- Frankfurter.
- Oh, really? Hmm.

49:10.614 --> 49:13.731
It's nothin'. I tell you,
what I love is what you do, literature.

49:14.034 --> 49:18.198
Well, hell, if I was first
in my class, I'd get a tattoo.

49:18.831 --> 49:21.573
So, what brings you
to New York, Dick, literature?

49:21.667 --> 49:22.873
Let me ask ya.

49:23.169 --> 49:26.377
Did you ever notice anything out of the
ordinary about the quiz show you're on?

49:27.173 --> 49:28.162
What?

49:29.091 --> 49:30.752
Anything suspect. Anything at all.

49:31.051 --> 49:33.588
You mean besides its popularity?

49:33.679 --> 49:34.714
What I'm hoping is that

49:34.722 --> 49:36.587
you might be able to give me
some kind of road map here.

49:36.682 --> 49:39.048
- I feel like we speak the same language.
- Well, of course.

49:39.059 --> 49:41.425
Anything I can do to help.

49:41.437 --> 49:42.893
- Oh, um, Mr. Van Doren.
- Yes? Yes, yes.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.936
I'm sorry. I'm in your class
on the Romantics, and...

49:45.024 --> 49:46.013
Of course you are.

49:46.108 --> 49:49.441
I... Actually, I'm auditing it
because you've been on television.

49:49.528 --> 49:52.565
- Do you... Should I come back later?
- Oh, if you don't mind...

49:52.573 --> 49:53.653
- I'll come back.
- I tell you what.

49:53.741 --> 49:55.231
Why don't you meet me tomorrow?

49:55.242 --> 49:57.949
- I'll take you to lunch at the Athenaeum.
- The what?

49:57.953 --> 50:00.239
I'm sorry. The Athenaeum Club
at Forty-third and Fifth?

50:00.331 --> 50:02.993
Say, tomorrow at noon?

50:03.083 --> 50:04.789
- Lunch at The Athenaeum.
- At noon.

50:04.793 --> 50:05.908
- Great.
- Great. See you then.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.332
I wanted to talk to you
about <i>Ode on a Grecian Urn.</i>

50:08.422 --> 50:10.333
"Beauty is truth, truth, beauty.

50:10.424 --> 50:13.336
"That is all ye know on earth
and all ye need to know."

50:13.427 --> 50:14.758
Does he really mean that
about beauty and truth?

50:14.762 --> 50:16.468
Why foster child? I don't under...

50:16.931 --> 50:18.796
Congress investigates communists.

50:18.891 --> 50:21.803
Congress investigates mobsters.
That is not me.

50:21.894 --> 50:25.432
Yeah, well, look on the bright side.
You'll be on national television.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.430
- That's a joke, Charlie.
- Well, that's not funny.

50:27.525 --> 50:28.856
- Charles Van Doren.
- It's just not funny.

50:28.943 --> 50:31.150
Hey! Charles Van Doren!

50:31.153 --> 50:33.144
- How ya doin'?
- I'm worried about this.

50:33.239 --> 50:36.606
- Yeah, well, look, I... Who was that?
- It's just some guy.

50:36.617 --> 50:38.357
Well, look, I already know about
this guy Goodwin,

50:38.452 --> 50:39.783
and I'm on top of it. So trust me.

50:39.787 --> 50:41.152
- You callin' Information?
- You don't understand.

50:41.247 --> 50:42.327
What are you dialin' for?

50:42.331 --> 50:43.366
- Oh, for information?
- I have a name.

50:43.457 --> 50:46.790
Charles Van Doren,
he's dialin' for information.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.994
Hey, Chuck, what do you do?
Chuckie! Answer this question.

50:50.005 --> 50:51.336
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

50:51.340 --> 50:53.831
What street do I live
on in Brooklyn, huh?

50:53.842 --> 50:56.675
- Did you tell him anything?
- No, no, I didn't...

50:56.762 --> 50:59.219
I gotta go. I gotta go! I've gotta go!

50:59.306 --> 51:02.548
Come on! Let's go! Hey, Chuck, how ya
doin'? How ya holdin' up? All right?

51:02.643 --> 51:04.554
Hey, can I get an autograph
for my wife?

51:04.645 --> 51:06.476
Give me an autograph for my wife!

51:06.480 --> 51:09.017
Come on, Charles, don't be a snob.
Give me an autograph for my wife!

51:09.775 --> 51:11.982
So Sandra says
what's ever on her mind.

51:11.986 --> 51:14.193
And you've been married how long?

51:14.196 --> 51:16.312
Five years. You?

51:16.865 --> 51:20.153
Oh, no. I'm supposed to be
fixed up with this girl

51:20.160 --> 51:22.993
on the cover of the new
<i>Harper's Bazaar,</i> but...

51:23.080 --> 51:25.662
- Well, you know how that is.
- Yeah.

51:26.834 --> 51:29.826
- Waldorf salad for you, Mr. Van Doren.
- Oh, thank you.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.661
- And a Reuben sandwich.
- Thank you.

51:34.675 --> 51:35.755
- So...
- Oh.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.427
What do you know about this
grand jury investigation, Charlie?

51:41.348 --> 51:43.509
Oh, I remember Dan mentioned
something about this,

51:43.601 --> 51:46.593
that it was all some...
Some wild goose chase.

51:47.896 --> 51:49.932
Uh, a political thing.

51:50.357 --> 51:53.349
They talk so fast in that business.
Half of it goes right past me.

51:53.360 --> 51:54.395
Dan?

51:54.486 --> 51:57.148
Enright. He's really the one to talk to.

51:57.489 --> 52:00.276
- You know if he testified?
- Uh, uh, more water?

52:03.078 --> 52:06.195
You can reach him at N BC.
Dan Enright.

52:11.670 --> 52:14.662
So, how long have you been
with this committee, Dick?

52:15.174 --> 52:19.042
Six months. Seemed like a good way
to postpone the inevitable.

52:19.303 --> 52:22.887
Postpone the inevitable.
Is there a spot for me?

52:24.058 --> 52:25.798
I mean Wall Street.

52:25.893 --> 52:27.429
Oh.

52:30.606 --> 52:33.723
So, back to this grand jury business.

52:33.734 --> 52:35.349
- I'm wondering...
- Oh.

52:35.903 --> 52:38.360
- Dad.
- Charlie.

52:39.573 --> 52:41.188
Excuse me, Frank.

52:42.242 --> 52:43.948
This is a surprise.

52:44.578 --> 52:47.445
How are you, son? We share an office,
and I never see you anymore.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.575
I'm there, Dad.
I'm just hiding behind your reputation.

52:49.583 --> 52:52.074
No, I'm serious.
We all miss you at home.

52:52.086 --> 52:53.792
Please, join us.
Dad, this is Dick Goodwin.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.081
He's up from Washington.

52:55.089 --> 52:57.455
- Narrow escape.
- Dad doesn't like Washington.

52:57.549 --> 53:00.712
A swamp that traded malaria for politics.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.796
- What's the special?
- It's the Reuben.

53:06.266 --> 53:09.599
Reuben sandwich is the only
entirely invented sandwich.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.178
Won the National Sandwich
Contest two years ago.

53:12.272 --> 53:15.105
- A salient point. Who invented it?
- Reuben Kay.

53:15.192 --> 53:18.355
- At a poker game in Omaha.
- I knew there was a "K" in Nebraska.

53:18.821 --> 53:20.982
Unfortunately,
they have the sandwich here,

53:21.073 --> 53:22.813
but they don't seem to have
any Reubens.

53:26.286 --> 53:28.698
- TouchÃ©.
- Dick's a protÃ©gÃ© of Clark Byse.

53:28.956 --> 53:31.197
I just finished a clerkship
with Justice Frankfurter.

53:31.583 --> 53:32.663
Of course you did.

53:32.751 --> 53:36.118
Frankfurter collects brains
the way other people collect stamps.

53:36.463 --> 53:38.249
Did you happen to see
the show Monday, Dad?

53:38.507 --> 53:41.123
Monday.
Uh, we were with Bunny Wilson.

53:41.135 --> 53:43.467
Oh, no, it's nothing. Just there
was a question about Hawthorne.

53:43.554 --> 53:46.796
Oh, well, you know how it is
with Bunny once he gets going.

53:46.807 --> 53:49.139
So, Dick, Charlie invite you
to his poker game yet?

53:49.226 --> 53:50.966
He's a helluva poker player.

53:51.061 --> 53:52.972
We have a regular game
Thursday nights,

53:52.980 --> 53:54.470
just some friends I went to school with.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.017
You're welcome to come over
next week.

53:56.024 --> 53:57.309
Are you a gambler, Dick?

53:58.152 --> 54:01.610
I don't know if I'm a gambler.
I know which end of an ace is up.

54:02.406 --> 54:06.319
Well, Dick, if you look round the table
and you can't tell who the sucker is,

54:07.536 --> 54:08.821
it's you.

54:10.873 --> 54:12.909
Yeah, Dan Enright, please.

54:15.335 --> 54:16.825
Uh, Dick Goodwin.

54:21.467 --> 54:24.004
Uh, no. Actually, I'll just call back.
Thanks.

54:24.094 --> 54:27.507
"Name the three heavyweight
champions who preceded Joe Louis."

54:27.514 --> 54:30.096
Oh, I know that.
Uh, Jim Braddock.

54:30.350 --> 54:33.012
- Mmm-hmm.
- Max Baer.

54:34.188 --> 54:35.348
And...

54:37.691 --> 54:39.682
- Damn.
- Primo Carnera.

54:39.985 --> 54:42.522
- Primo Carnera. Of course.
- Yeah, good old Primo.

54:42.613 --> 54:44.524
I was there that night at the Garden,
the night Baer beat him.

54:44.531 --> 54:45.611
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:45.699 --> 54:48.736
The big guinea.
12 times Baer knocked him down.

54:48.827 --> 54:50.067
Al, I've been thinking.

54:50.078 --> 54:52.945
Maybe you shouldn't
give me the answers anymore.

54:55.459 --> 54:58.371
Now what do you wanna
do that for, Professor?

54:58.462 --> 55:01.579
Charlie, you're doin'
the right thing, really.

55:01.673 --> 55:02.913
Everybody's makin' money.

55:03.008 --> 55:04.418
Well, what if you just
gave me the questions

55:04.510 --> 55:06.296
and I could look up
the answers on my own?

55:06.386 --> 55:09.469
I mean, don't you think that'd be...
Well, be less egregious.

55:12.726 --> 55:14.512
<i>Only in the balcony.</i>

55:15.896 --> 55:17.761
<i>You know about that.</i>

55:17.856 --> 55:20.347
<i>All right. Now, your consequence...</i>

55:21.401 --> 55:25.144
Doesn't want the answers anymore.
Just wants the questions.

55:25.239 --> 55:28.481
- Who?
- "Who." The Great White Hope.

55:32.246 --> 55:33.952
Dan, what the hell is "egregious"?

55:34.748 --> 55:36.454
He just wants the questions?

55:38.418 --> 55:40.409
Excuse me. Mr. Noland?

55:40.504 --> 55:42.290
- Yeah?
- My name is Richard Goodwin.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.838
I'm with the Congressional
Subcommittee on Legislative...

55:44.925 --> 55:46.131
Ah.

55:46.134 --> 55:49.297
<i>No, no, I don't wanna say</i>
<i>anything. No, can't help you.</i>

55:49.304 --> 55:50.919
<i>I told them</i>
<i>everything I had to say.</i>

55:50.931 --> 55:52.887
<i>Everything I knew, I told them.</i>

56:04.444 --> 56:05.524
Yeah?

56:05.612 --> 56:07.853
Mr. Stempel. My name is Dick Goodwin.

56:07.948 --> 56:10.815
I'm an investigator with the
Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight

56:10.826 --> 56:12.316
of the U. S. Congress.

56:12.327 --> 56:13.362
Yeah?

56:13.453 --> 56:15.489
Did you recently testify
before a grand jury?

56:15.581 --> 56:16.616
Yeah.

56:16.623 --> 56:19.740
Well, if you have a minute,
I'd really like to talk to you about it.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.168
Gee.

56:23.630 --> 56:26.463
Finally. I knew it was
just a matter of time.

56:26.550 --> 56:27.790
Come in.

56:30.095 --> 56:32.632
Didn't you go to City College?

56:32.639 --> 56:34.254
- Harvard.
- Toby.

56:36.476 --> 56:38.683
This is my wife, Toby.
This is Mr. Goodwin.

56:38.770 --> 56:41.136
He's an investigator from
the United States Congress.

56:41.231 --> 56:45.144
Would you like a cup of coffee, Mr...
I already got the pot on.

56:45.152 --> 56:46.733
I tell ya, that sounds great, actually.

56:47.529 --> 56:50.145
And bring some rugulach
if there are any left.

56:50.240 --> 56:53.073
I love my wife, but it's like
livin' with a plague of locusts.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.155
If Charles Van Doren told 'em
what I told 'em,

56:56.246 --> 56:58.988
do you think this whole grand jury thing
would be squashed?

56:59.207 --> 57:02.324
- Quashed. It's not "squashed."
- Not in a million years.

57:02.336 --> 57:03.496
Quashed, okay?

57:03.587 --> 57:05.373
What exactly did you
tell the grand jury?

57:05.380 --> 57:07.416
- Have one.
- No, thanks.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.839
Lester, will you
knock it off for 10 minutes?

57:09.927 --> 57:13.044
Come on. They're a Jewish delicacy.
Before Toby eats it.

57:13.055 --> 57:16.718
- I'm retainin' water for your information.
- You and the Grand Coulee Dam.

57:16.725 --> 57:18.215
Come on. You don't know
what you're missing.

57:18.310 --> 57:20.676
I'm quite familiar with rugulach,
thank you.

57:23.190 --> 57:26.557
- How'd a guy like you get into Harvard?
- Capped teeth.

57:26.568 --> 57:29.059
Lester.

57:29.071 --> 57:31.904
Herb, what exactly did you
tell the grand jury?

57:32.407 --> 57:35.194
No, you can't ask me that.
It's... It's sealed. It's illegal.

57:37.037 --> 57:39.528
Well, just between us.

57:41.166 --> 57:43.248
They made me take a dive. <i>Marty.</i>

57:43.335 --> 57:46.873
They made me lose on <i>Marty</i>
just to humiliate me.

57:46.880 --> 57:49.246
- Who made you take a dive?
- Dan Enright.

57:49.257 --> 57:51.919
He told me I had plateaued,
that the ratings had plateaued.

57:51.927 --> 57:53.588
A sinking ship and the rats stayed.

57:53.679 --> 57:55.419
Do you think in a million years
I wouldn't know <i>Marty,</i>

57:55.514 --> 57:56.924
and meanwhile, Charles Van Moron

57:57.015 --> 57:58.721
would be on the show
11 weeks in a row?

57:58.725 --> 58:01.558
I don't understand.
How could they make you take a dive?

58:01.561 --> 58:02.767
What?

58:02.854 --> 58:05.095
Why didn't you just answer <i>Marty</i>
if you knew it?

58:05.190 --> 58:07.602
What, and throw away
his future in television?

58:07.693 --> 58:10.810
Would you please go inside
and tell Gene Krupa to take five?

58:11.238 --> 58:12.774
Lester. Lester!

58:12.781 --> 58:16.239
You're so naive. It's a fix.
It's all... It's all a fix.

58:16.243 --> 58:19.656
A setup. I made a study of it.
They always follow a Jew with a Gentile.

58:19.746 --> 58:23.079
And the Gentile wins more money.
What is that, a coincidence?

58:23.083 --> 58:25.449
Herb, you're saying this whole grand
jury thing was because of you.

58:25.460 --> 58:29.044
You know what you have to do?
You have to nail Van Doren.

58:29.506 --> 58:30.746
Are you gonna nail Van Doren?

58:30.757 --> 58:32.588
Look, first of all,
I'm not here to nail anyone, okay?

58:32.592 --> 58:33.752
This isn't McCarthyism.

58:33.844 --> 58:35.630
Listen, think about
what McCarthyism did for McCarthy.

58:35.637 --> 58:36.672
Let me ask you something.

58:36.763 --> 58:38.628
Do you have any corroborative
evidence to what you're saying?

58:38.640 --> 58:40.301
Listen to me. Don't make necessarily

58:40.392 --> 58:42.804
the mistakes that I might have
made in life.

58:42.894 --> 58:44.600
Think about your career.

58:44.604 --> 58:46.640
You nail Van Doren,
it'll be bigger than Sputnik.

58:46.648 --> 58:50.687
It'll be like a big, blond Sputnik crashing
right down on his, whew, friggin' head.

58:54.489 --> 58:57.276
Charlie? Hi. Dick Goodwin.

58:57.284 --> 58:58.364
I hope you don't mind.

58:58.452 --> 59:00.943
The English Department gave me
your number up in Connecticut.

59:00.954 --> 59:04.663
Yeah. Look, I met with
Herbert Stempel yesterday.

59:04.750 --> 59:07.708
He told me a couple of things.
I'm kinda curious...

59:08.962 --> 59:10.122
What?

59:11.423 --> 59:13.459
Sure. Well, what train was that?

59:14.301 --> 59:16.633
<i>Yeah, just hold on.</i>
<i>I got a pen right here.</i>

59:16.636 --> 59:18.877
<i>Grand Central Station.</i>

59:18.972 --> 59:20.382
<i>Housatonic.</i>

59:21.141 --> 59:22.972
<i>Cornwall, Connecticut.</i>

59:23.060 --> 59:26.302
<i>I will... I will... I'll get right on the way.</i>

59:35.781 --> 59:38.648
- Dick, I'm glad you could make it.
- Charlie.

59:39.659 --> 59:41.650
That's some snappy-looking Mercedes.

59:41.787 --> 59:43.527
Come around the back.
We're just about to eat.

59:43.622 --> 59:44.828
What's that, the 300?

59:44.831 --> 59:48.073
Yeah, it's my father's birthday,
so I bought myself a car.

59:48.168 --> 59:52.252
- It's only got 110 miles on it.
- The show's treatin' you well, huh?

59:53.965 --> 59:56.581
Dorothy, your tomato salad is fabulous.

59:56.676 --> 59:59.167
- What's your secret?
- Manure.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.214
Now, look at Thomas.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:04.173
Thomas is aerodynamically designed
to go directly to heaven.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:08.018
- And who are you?
- Dick. Goodwin.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:10.266
- I'm a friend of Charlie's.
- Ah.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:13.018
- You sound like you're from Boston.
- Brookline, actually.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:18.854
The wrong girl for me.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.607
- You know I didn't.
- You did.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.237
We have horseradish
growing in the garden.

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:26.115
Well, that's true.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.739
- How long have you been married?
- 20 years.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.826
Aunt Irita had an affair
with Wendell Willkie.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.080
Hmm?

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:39.008
"Now see summer bloom upon this lea.
Three score rings around this tree.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:41.301
"Once green, now bare.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.379
"Once lush, now sere.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:46.055
"Consoled only that I am

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:48.892
- "planted here."
- You certainly are.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.760
- "Roots thick..."
- And old.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.387
- "...and deep,"
- And doddering.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:56.392
- "...assuage my woes..."
- A termite nibbles at my toes.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.815
<i>- Et tu,</i> Bunny?
- Charlie, is Jack Barry single?

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:00.895
I think so.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.573
My roommate has a crush on him.
She wants you to introduce her.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.900
What's Dave Garroway like?

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.405
- Cheap.
- "Cheat"?

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:07.619
Wasn't I talking?

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:10.618
You were, yes.
Talking and talking and talking.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:13.576
Charlie's famous, like Elvis Presley.

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:17.296
Like Leopold of Belgium,
usurped by his son before his time.

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:19.498
I suppose that makes me
King Baudouin?

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:22.175
Next birthday,
you all get a dirty limerick.

01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:24.969
I certainly hope so.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.095
So how's it feel, Charlie?

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.261
Well, I can't even
eat dinner in a restaurant anymore.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:36.815
People follow me inside to discover
what kind of "brain food" I eat.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:40.936
In my day, it was flagpole-sitting
and swallowing goldfish.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:43.773
Last week alone,
I had 11 proposals of marriage.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:45.319
Perhaps you should
accept one of them.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:48.652
To think they unleash you
on those impressionable young minds.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:50.283
Why not? He's 33 years old.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.872
Jesus Christ had a girlfriend
at 33 years old.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.621
- Look how that turned out.
- And he shared an office with his father.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.460
I'm sure they're all very nice girls.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.671
In that case, perhaps I should
appear on a quiz show.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.462
The money, meanwhile,
no one knows what to do with it.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:06.636
Though every stockbroker in New York
seems eager to try.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.631
Why don't you just put it in the bank?

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:10.849
That's what I've always done
with my prize money.

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:13.473
No, it's just...
You don't understand, Dad.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.349
There are all sorts of tax implications.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.806
I think I can understand
the concept of taxes.

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.732
At this level, it's a bit more complicated.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.400
And at my level?

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.521
I never thought of myself
having a level, Charlie.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:25.988
What level might that be?

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.694
I mean, it's not as if the money fell
into my lap. I worked for it.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.824
Work? Oh!

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:34.323
Millions of people watch
the game shows, Dad.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:37.079
Then I suppose we've become
a nation of proctors.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.411
- Mark.
- Help me out here, Harvard.

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:40.791
Uh...

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:43.419
Claim victory and depart the field.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.171
We don't have a television.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.344
Why on earth
would we need a television?

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.546
How much money is it again?

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:52.173
- What?
- They don't have a television.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:53.265
You haven't seen the show?

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.514
We were supposed to watch it
the other night at Thurber's...

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.638
Even Thurber has a television,
and he's blind.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:00.474
How much is it now, Charlie?

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.068
- $ 122,000.
- What?

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.238
She heard that all right.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:12.194
Well.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:17.866
"Some rise by sin
and some by virtue fall."

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:20.911
<i>Measure For Measure.</i>

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:25.249
"To do a great right, do a little wrong."

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:28.877
<i>- Merchant Of Venice.</i>
- It's this game our family plays.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:32.506
"O, what men dare do!
What men may do!

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:36.768
"What men daily do,

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.553
<i>Much Ado About Nothing.</i>

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:41.856
"Things without remedy
should be without regard,

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:43.854
"what's done is done."

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:47.654
"Things without all remedy." <i>Macbeth.</i>

01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:52.989
"How ill white hairs
become a fool and jester."

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:56.492
Now, Professor, open your presents.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:01.292
- Well, what have we here?
- Aftershave.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.287
Aw.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:08.299
Uh-huh.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.301
Oh, now.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:18.093
Oh, my God. How swell.

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:22.939
I guess I'm surrounded.
Thank you, Charlie.

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:25.768
I thought you might like it, Dad.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:33.446
So do you remember Herbert Stempel?

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:35.944
Remember him?
I still can't believe I beat him.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:40.658
Stempel tells me that Dan Enright
made him take a dive from the show.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.455
What?

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:47.046
He tells me that Dan Enright
made him take a dive.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.175
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah?

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:53.344
A little odd, though, don't ya think?

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:55.430
I mean, losing on
such an easy question?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.512
You know, frankly, Dick,
if Stempel can just run around

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:02.016
and smear a man like Dan Enright
to the United States Congress...

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.354
No, nobody's smearing anybody.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:05.394
I'm just trying to
figure out the truth here.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.350
Could you just untie the bowline there
and shove us off?

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:14.649
All right.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.197
Dick, could you raise
the jib for us, please?

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.998
The jib. Just... Yeah.

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:33.342
Do you remember what it was like for
guys like us when we were in school?

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:36.592
Being smart was like being cross-eyed.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:38.889
But you should see the letters I get.

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:41.509
Kids are excited about... About books

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.012
and learning and general knowledge.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.478
Dan Enright had a lot to do with that.

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:50.276
Yeah, but don't you think
he wanted you to win?

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.729
I mean, if you look at the ratings,
they're staggering.

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:56.575
Well, what did he say,
they "made" him take a dive?

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:57.741
Well.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.906
Well, how did they "make" him
take a dive anyway?

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.701
He didn't want to jeopardize any
future he might have in television.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.451
Yeah, well...

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:10.539
Anyway, how many people did you say
testified in front of the grand jury?

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.631
Why? What's your point?

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:16.337
Well, if what you're saying is true,
then everybody lied.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:30.229
- H i. Al Freedman.
- H i. I'm Danny.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.938
Good to see you. I'm sorry for the delay.
Come on in. Have a seat.

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.943
Would you like a cup of coffee
or a soft drink?

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.565
- Anything?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:39.113
- You sure?
- We're very well stocked up here.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:40.239
- Nothing?
- I'm fine.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.235
No trouble.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.071
I understand you've spoken to
Charles Van Doren.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.953
- And Herbert Stempel.
- Oh, I was afraid of that.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.918
He says and I quote,
that he was made to "take a dive."

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:51.334
Believe me, I'm quite familiar
with Herb's allegations.

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:53.130
I could recite them by rote.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:56.130
46 witnesses swore up and down
Herbie's a lying tub of shit.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:57.252
- Al.
- Sorry.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.635
- Why the big secret?
- Well, to protect people's reputations.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:05.636
I mean, frankly, you never know what
the public is gonna believe, you see?

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.433
There's that and...

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.104
And what?

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:14.815
Look, Dick, I... Can I call you Dick?

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.112
Sure, Dan.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:19.487
After the loss, Herb came to
visit me in an agitated...

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:23.490
Well, I suppose the clinical term
would be... What?

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:25.284
- The guy's nuts.
- Manic.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.532
- He was in a manic frame of mind.
- Manic.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:30.710
And I took the precaution
of tape recording that meeting.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.253
Al, would you play the tape?

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.252
Listen to this.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:38.501
<i>You get me that panel show</i>

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:41.300
<i>or I'm gonna bring you down,</i>
<i>you lousy lyin' prick.</i>

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.552
<i>You and Charles Van fuckin' Doren.</i>

01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:45.508
<i>What is this, Herb?</i>
<i>Are you blackmailin' me?</i>

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:48.845
<i>I need that money, Dan.</i>
<i>I need to get back on television.</i>

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.062
<i>You get me that panel show</i>

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.640
<i>- or I'll tell everyone it's a fraud.</i>
- <i>You know that's not true.</i>

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:53.895
<i>Who cares if it's true?</i>

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:55.568
<i>"The fix is in</i>
<i>this week on</i> Twenty-One."

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:56.644
Okay.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:03.698
So he needed more money
after all that money he won.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:06.162
Gambling. And that's the least of it.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:10.208
I mean, if the judge was protecting
anyone, he was protecting Herb.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.497
Given... Well...

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:20.046
- His medical condition.
- His medical condition?

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:21.919
- Oh, yeah.
- Al, get the bills.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.679
I mean, put yourself in his shoes.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.100
He's no longer in the public eye.

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:31.019
He's remembered,
if he's remembered at all,

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.765
as "the guy that lost to Van Doren."

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:35.600
Television is like a monkey on his back,

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:38.528
and we're not talking about someone
who is necessarily stable to begin with.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:41.732
- No.
- So you paid for his psychoanalysis?

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:43.233
- I felt responsible.
- You're too nice.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:44.700
- No, I'm not.
- If it were up to me,

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:46.535
I would've sent him to the skating rink
the fast way.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.535
- Five sessions a week?
- Five, and not a dent.

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.910
Herb is so angry with himself for losing,

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.206
and it was on
such a simple question, too.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:58.046
<i>- Marty.</i>
<i>- Marty.</i> His ego couldn't handle it.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:01.380
He blames Charles Van Doren
for his downfall.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:04.094
And, of course,
the real downfall of Herbert Stempel

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:06.555
- has always been Herbert Stempel.
- Herbert Stempel. Absolutely.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.554
You met him.
Does he seem stable to you?

01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:12.220
Well, I definitely have an inkling
of what you're talking about.

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:15.723
He told me this whole story about
how when a Jew is on the show,

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:19.481
he always loses to a Gentile, and then
the Gentile wins more money.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:23.399
Right? Who could
dream up a scheme like that?

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.609
A symptom of his Van Doren fixation.

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:28.444
The thing of it is, I looked it up. It's true.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:33.412
We could check it.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.290
Herbie, I wanna go home.

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:39.087
I took you to dinner, didn't I?
Just hold your horses.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.424
This is ridiculous.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:49.928
Where have you been?

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:52.928
Why don't you return my phone calls?
Did you talk to Van Doren?

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.100
I'll tell you who I spoke to.
I spoke to Dan Enright.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:56.313
Forget Enright.

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:57.937
Goodwin, 1535.

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:00.643
You threatened to blackmail him
if he didn't get you on a panel show?

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.988
What? When? I didn't blackmail him.
What are you talking about?

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:08.159
- He's got the whole thing on tape.
- He promised me that panel show.

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:10.824
What tape?
What are you talking about?

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:13.122
Listen, Goodwin, don't think
I don't see what you're doin'.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.120
You're building this great case
against me.

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:18.666
A pile of evidence, an army of witnesses
against me, Herb Stempel.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.371
And meanwhile,
you and Van Doren are off

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.502
giving each other the secret
Ivy League handshake.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:24.000
Herb, you're makin' me look like a jerk.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:25.676
I know what they're doin' to you.
They did it to me.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:26.843
Just because you went to Harvard,

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.671
you think you have
some stake in the system?

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:30.381
He didn't pay for your psychiatrist bills?

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:33.183
The point is
Van Doren got the answers.

01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:36.224
He did not get the answers.
If anything, he gave them the answers.

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:37.680
I know he got the answers.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:39.686
Ah, bullshit, Herb.
How do you know he got the answers?

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:41.358
Because I got the answers.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.365
You got the answers?

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:53.158
What do you mean,
you got the answers?

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:54.372
Not very many answers.

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:57.701
I just wanted to get out from
under the financial thumb of my in-laws.

01:10:57.795 --> 01:11:00.537
I don't understand.
I thought you were a victim in all this.

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:04.044
I didn't hold myself up to be
the crowned prince of education.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.713
I didn't preen myself
on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:08.340
with a face full of phony humility...

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:09.757
Good night, Herb.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:19.309
Toby.

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:24.186
Toby, where do you think
you're going without me?

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.188
You never told me you got the answers.

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.861
I knew the answers to
a good part of the questions anyhow.

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:30.404
The ones I didn't, they fed me.

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:32.948
- I'm sure I must've mentioned it.
- It's not a thing you mentioned.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.904
What else did you do
that you didn't mention?

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:38.583
Enright sat right in our kitchen and said,
"How'd you like to make $25,000?"

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:41.081
I don't know any man in America
who would turn that down.

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:44.209
- It's dishonest.
- Let me tell you about honest.

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:45.878
You know what
my father used to tell me?

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.710
"Work hard and you'll get ahead."
Was that honest?

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:52.213
Look at Geritol.
"Geritol cures tired blood."

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:54.386
And I'm the one
who's supposed to be ashamed.

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.475
You never said that you were
getting the answers.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.553
Let them believe whatever they want.
What do I care?

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:03.062
- What do I care if a bunch of saps...
- I was one of those saps, Herbert.

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.454
He got the answers.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.624
Now why would he admit that?
He's only implicating himself.

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:24.166
- Well, maybe it's the truth.
- Yeah, well I have a hunch it is the truth.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:27.249
Though meanwhile, we'll have to
have him testify in a straitjacket.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.426
But Van Doren isn't crazy.
Maybe you should put him on the stand.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:33.596
- What's Van Doren got to do with this?
- They gave Stempel the answers.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.260
Why would Van Doren be any different?

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.842
You have no idea what
these people are like.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:40.929
It's all Thurber and Trilling
and Bunny Wilson.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.012
<i>Bunny?</i>

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.440
Yeah, Edmund Wilson.
That's what they call him.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.313
Well, that doesn't mean you have to.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.687
Look, my point is, why would a guy
like that jeopardize everything he has?

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:51.318
- Which is what?
- Sandra,

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:53.445
the man is on
the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine.

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:56.869
He's not gonna be on the cover of
<i>Time</i> as Mark Van Doren's son, Dick.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:13:00.164
<i>Boxing. How many</i>
<i>points would you like to risk?</i>

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.617
<i>I'll risk eight points, Jack.</i>

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:06.462
<i>All right. For eight points, name</i>
<i>the three heavyweight champions</i>

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:08.956
<i>immediately preceding Joe Louis.</i>

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.012
<i>Well, my father would know that.</i>

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.716
<i>- That'd be James J. Braddock.</i>
<i>- Correct.</i>

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.806
<i>Max Baer lost the belt to Braddock.</i>

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:24.310
<i>Yes. And the fellow Baer beat?</i>

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.356
<i>Oh, now, I remember</i>
<i>he knocked him down 12 times</i>

01:13:26.444 --> 01:13:28.025
<i>before he finally succumbed.</i>

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.979
<i>- Would you like to guess?</i>
<i>- Primo Carnera.</i>

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.026
<i>Correct. You have 21.</i>

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:36.866
Second base is Eddie Stanky.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.286
No, it's Red Schoendienst.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.202
I hear that Pat Boone
plays on the White Shoes.

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:44.534
- No, that's Daniel Boone.
- Ace-King bets.

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:45.835
- Check.
- Check.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.002
Bet five.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.080
- I'll raise that a dollar.
- I'm out.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:51.875
You better watch out, Fred.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:54.218
Dick's one of the brightest
young lawyers down in Washington.

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:58.715
Great. All my money already
goes to Washington. Taxes.

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:01.183
- It's nothin' but organized theft.
- No, property.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.512
- What?
- "Property is theft," I believe.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.893
That's the locus classicus
from Proudhon.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.724
I warned you.

01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:11.526
- Oh, great, another one.
- Ace bets five.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:16.490
- And another one.
- I'll see that.

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:20.407
- What are you working on, Charlie?
- I raise $5.

01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:22.405
I'd love to know
what you got under there, Charlie.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.077
The truth has its price.

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:25.541
Everything has its price.

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:30.421
So where'd ya prep, Dick?

01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:33.921
Dick's up here on a witch hunt.
He thinks <i>Twenty-One</i> is rigged.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:35.547
Is it?

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:43.225
Hey, which face cards are
in profile, without looking?

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.473
Jack of spades,
king of diamonds, jack of hearts.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.772
Can we play cards? It's bad enough
my wife makes me watch this crap.

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:51.768
Okay, you're writing a book on Lincoln.
The night he was shot,

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:53.235
who was the doctor at his deathbed?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.980
Joseph K. Barnes was the doctor.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.942
- Whoa.
- Who was the detective on the case?

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:02.278
The detective was Clarvoe.
John Alexander Clarvoe.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:03.995
- Who embalmed him?
- Come on.

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.914
Black or brown, Charles D. Brown.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:08.625
Then he was murdered
with estate taxes. Let's play.

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:11.086
- You're not impressed?
- Ace checks.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.209
Check.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.089
Whoa!

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.137
Now I'm impressed.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:22.302
Go ahead, Dick, call 'em.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.093
What do you say, Dick?

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:29.101
I know you're lying.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:32.267
Whoa-oh.

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:36.066
Bluffing. The word is bluffing.

01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.198
Too rich for my blood.

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.372
- Try Geritol.
- Sandwich time.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.996
How 'bout a drink?

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.211
This game could use a little juice, huh?

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.547
<i>Charlie? Charlie?</i>

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:01.800
The only people who can implicate you
directly are all in this room.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.172
Just think about that.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:04.973
You think that <i>nudzh</i> is gonna
get me to talk?

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.141
He may be a <i>nudzh,</i>

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.685
but he was also first in his class
at Harvard Law School.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:10.684
- Oh, Harvard?
- Will you please stop that?

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:12.311
- Al, stop it.
- Sorry.

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.684
Charlie, they could kill me,
I wouldn't talk.

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:17.395
They could subject me
to any kind of torture...

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.855
- The rack?
- Thank you.

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:20.197
They could put me on the rack...

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:21.524
- The iron maiden?
- Whatever.

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:22.524
The bastinado?

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.077
Charlie, I'm not tellin' 'em
a goddamned thing.

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:27.029
- Correct me, Dan, if I'm wrong.
- No, you're right.

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:28.580
Plus, what did you do wrong?

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:30.578
Everybody knows the magician don't
saw the lady in half.

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:33.661
- It's not exactly the same thing.
- It's entertainment.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.833
I am a college professor.

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:40.876
They need the professor in make-up.

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:39.731
Oh, well.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.905
Aren't you Charles Van Doren?

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:45.945
I'm sorry, Dad.
I didn't mean to wake you.

01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:47.818
I just had to get out of the city.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.154
You're always welcome, Charlie.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:54.416
Sometimes it's hard sleeping in the city.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.744
I hope you don't mind.
I took the rest of the cake.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.455
You look like you could use it.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.461
Under a little strain lately.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:04.084
That's the way it always is
when you're finishing a book.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.963
Oh, no, actually,
it's the television show.

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:11.468
Oh, Jesus, I just realized,
we watched your show.

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:14.936
Did I tell you? Mother and I
moved the television to the den.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:18.642
- No, no, you didn't mention it.
- Anyway, what was it?

01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:21.359
Something about
the Galapagos Islands?

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:23.984
You know what? I'll try some of that.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:26.986
The origin and the destination
of the voyage of the <i>Beagle.</i>

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:30.661
That's right. Biology for six points.

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.326
Good God, the pressure.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:37.501
All those lights, the money,
those strange little booths,

01:18:37.504 --> 01:18:41.497
that man talking so fast,
like being in a bull ring.

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:44.500
I don't think I could remember my name.

01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:46.968
You know, I always had a good head
for that kind of stuff.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:50.590
It's just amazing that
you could make it look so easy.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:55.344
But your mother always said you were
the actor in the family, Charlie.

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:57.020
Yeah.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:19:01.646
As long as it doesn't interfere
with your teaching, why not?

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:07.148
Dad.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:10.659
Huh? What?

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:19.577
Something on your mind?

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:31.130
You never told me you felt pressure...

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:36.093
You know, like finishing a book.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.971
Oh-ho, are you kidding?

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:42.896
When I was finishing the Hawthorne
book, I tossed and turned so badly

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:45.694
your mother threatened
to check into a hotel.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.692
Oh, sure.

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:52.694
You know, I think the old bird's
finally getting the hang of this.

01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:57.748
You know, I just had
the strongest memory.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:20:01.084
Coming home from school,
going to the fridge.

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:04.663
Ice-cold bottle of milk,
big piece of chocolate cake.

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:08.209
It was just the simplicity of it.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:12.262
I can't think of anything that will
make me feel that happy again.

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:18.059
Not till you have a son.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:33.158
<i>That would</i>
<i>be our most difficult question</i>

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:34.234
<i>on American literature.</i>

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:38.289
<i>For 11 points, I'll read you lines</i>
<i>from America's greatest poets.</i>

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.783
<i>You must identify the author. First,</i>

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:44.753
<i>"I hear America singing,</i>
<i>the varied carols I hear."</i>

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.252
<i>That would be Walt Whitman.</i>

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:49.425
<i>That's right. Second,</i>

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:53.925
<i>"I shot an arrow in the air.</i>
<i>It fell to earth I know not where."</i>

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:57.933
- <i>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</i>
<i>- Right again, Jim.</i>

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:02.184
<i>Finally, "Hope is the thing with feathers</i>
<i>that perches in the soul."</i>

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:06.358
<i>That is actually</i>
<i>by one of my favorite poets,</i>

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:08.853
<i>Emily Dickinson.</i>

01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:10.562
<i>I'm sorry, Jim.</i>

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.489
<i>Did... Did you say Emily Dickinson?</i>

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:16.618
<i>Oh! Well, yes. All right.</i>

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.786
<i>...Dickinson.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, Jim.</i>

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:30.966
<i>Did... Did you say Emily Dickinson?</i>
<i>Oh! Well, yes.</i>

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:41.973
<i>...favorite poets, Emily Dickinson.</i>

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.392
<i>I'm sorry, Jim.</i>

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:47.061
<i>Did... Did you say Emily Dickinson?</i>

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.526
<i>Oh! Well, yes.</i>

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.026
- Who is it?
- Mr. Snodgrass?

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.828
- Yeah?
- My name is Richard Goodwin.

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:01.534
- Yeah?
- Hi.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:04.992
I'm a Federal Investigator
on a congressional subcommittee.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.873
The committee's been
investigating the quiz shows.

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:10.839
I was just looking at a kinescope of
your appearance on <i>Twenty-One,</i>

01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:12.379
and I noticed...

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:13.925
Mr. Snodgrass?

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:27.355
- This is good.
- Yeah? What is it?

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.906
- Drive on by.
- What?

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:46.203
- Go around to the back entrance.
- Okay.

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:52.544
Mr. Kintner's office.

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:57.761
Excuse me. Do you think he might
see me before the peacock molts?

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.133
Who are you with again?

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.806
I'm with the U.S. Congress.
Perhaps you've heard of them.

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:05.761
Oh, your name is Gold... Excuse me,
not you. Your name is Goldwyn?

01:23:05.772 --> 01:23:06.932
- Goodwin.
- Yes.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:08.980
Please have a seat, Mr. Goldwyn...
Goodwin.

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.773
- I'll see if he's available.
- Right.

01:23:10.777 --> 01:23:14.736
Yes, that's red, long stem. Thank you.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.652
Well, I'm sure he'd be available
if my name were Geritol.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:20.655
Perhaps if you could
come back another time.

01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:23.950
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, Mr. Kintner.

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:26.657
Mr. Kintner.
My name is Richard Goodwin.

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:29.164
I'm with the Congressional
Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.585
Congratulations.

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:34.002
- How's Chairman Harris?
- He's fine.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:36.458
Still in that sand trap where I left him?

01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:39.761
I am here to give you
a chance to cooperate.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.590
We'll cooperate in any way we can.
Now will you excuse me?

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.174
<i>Twenty-One</i> is rigged,
and I can prove it.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:45.600
Who won, how long they were on,

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.143
it was all a scheme
to keep the ratings up,

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:48.603
and N BC made millions off it.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:49.938
Young man,

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:54.485
I am the President of the
National Broadcasting Company.

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:58.857
I have no idea what the day-to-day
operations of <i>Twenty-One</i> are.

01:23:58.951 --> 01:24:02.284
Does Chairman Harris know every
little thing you're up to?

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:06.284
I have Enright cold.
And, sir, that means I have you.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:08.122
- Really?
- Really.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:11.536
Then why are you the one
that's sweating?

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.835
This week's challenger
from New York, New York,

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:17.673
welcome Mrs. Vivienne Nearing.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:22.342
And returning this week with $ 139,000,
our champion, Charles Van Doren.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:27.809
A very cordial welcome to the show,
Mrs. Nearing.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.181
- Mr. Van Doren.
- Jack.

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:31.305
You're back again with
a lot of money at stake.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.311
Mrs. Nearing, let's tell the Professor
and our audience

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.358
a little something about you.

01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:38.858
<i>A sometimes painter,</i>
<i>pianist and Double-Crostics fan,</i>

01:24:38.865 --> 01:24:42.198
<i>she has a Bachelor's Degree</i>
<i>from Queens College, New York,</i>

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.818
<i>and a M.A. and L.L.B. From Columbia.</i>

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.825
<i>She and her husband Victor</i>
<i>are lawyers in New York.</i>

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:49.664
Quite a bean
inside that pretty head, huh?

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:50.908
She's terrifying.

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:53.039
All right, I think you both know
how to play the game.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:54.836
Don't forget to put your earphones on.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.332
The very best of luck to both of you.
Let's play <i>Twenty-One.</i>

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:07.341
<i>Some of the most important airplanes</i>
<i>of World War II were the following,</i>

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:10.894
<i>the P-40, the P-47, the P-51,</i>

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:14.685
<i>the B-24, the B-25 and the B-26.</i>

01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:18.944
<i>Give me the nicknames</i>
<i>the Air Force gave to these planes.</i>

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:21.773
That's much harder than
the question they asked that woman,

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:23.732
and hers was 10 points.

01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:25.363
Do you know
the names of those planes?

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:26.576
Of course not. Sit down.

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:29.200
Who would know the names
of those planes?

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:32.040
- He's not the Secretary of Defense.
- Shh, shh.

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:34.288
As we enter our final round,

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:37.212
Mrs. Nearing leads
by a score of 21 to 16.

01:25:37.215 --> 01:25:39.046
It is the moment of truth, as it were,

01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:41.258
for Charles Van Doren,
our reigning champion,

01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:43.802
after a record-breaking 14 weeks.

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:45.629
Will he hold onto his title?

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:46.839
Wow.

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:49.717
- Mrs. Nearing.
<i>- Yes?</i>

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:51.639
You have the required 21 points.

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.971
We're going to let you listen in
on this last round.

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:57.558
Please do not divulge your score
or speak in any way.

01:25:57.569 --> 01:26:00.276
Mr. Van Doren, the category is royalty.

01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:03.655
- Royalty. Yes, sir.
- <i>Royalty.</i>

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:05.482
How many points
would you like to try for?

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:06.942
<i>Well, let's see.</i>

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.571
<i>I'll take five, five points.</i>

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:14.621
All right. Name the kings
of the following countries,

01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:18.462
Norway, Sweden, Belgium and Iraq.

01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:21.164
<i>- Could I take the third part last?</i>
<i>- Certainly.</i>

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:22.749
<i>Take as much time</i>
<i>as you need, Charlie.</i>

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.425
<i>You have a lot</i>
<i>riding on these answers.</i>

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:28.172
<i>I sure have. Well, Norway,</i>
<i>that would be Haakon. King Haakon.</i>

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:31.383
- <i>That's right.</i>
<i>- And Sweden, um, Gustavus.</i>

01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:35.520
<i>- Right again, Charlie. The King of Iraq?</i>
<i>- Iraq, uh...</i>

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:39.520
Turn it... Turn it off.
Turn the damn thing off.

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:44.313
- Good God. What got into you?
- It's just too nerve-wracking.

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:47.320
<i>I remember that's his</i>

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:51.245
<i>great-uncle in that wonderful book,</i>
The Seven Pillars Of Wisdom.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.197
<i>Um, Do... No, um...</i>

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:56.123
<i>King Faisal.</i>

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:57.951
Correct. And Belgium?

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:01.664
<i>Belgium. Belgium. Belgium. Belgium.</i>
<i>Let me see... That's the third part?</i>

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:03.214
That's right.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:04.583
Um...

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:08.003
<i>King of Belgium...</i>

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:17.888
<i>Let me see...</i>

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:21.850
Professor, would you like more time?

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:26.196
<i>Belgium, the King of Belgium.</i>

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:29.066
<i>I can picture him, Jack.</i>

01:27:29.453 --> 01:27:32.195
<i>Right down to that</i>
<i>Hapsburg lip that they...</i>

01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:34.621
<i>I can't seem to summon the name.</i>

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.160
<i>Um...</i>

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:39.208
He's gonna dump it.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:46.041
Is Garroway here?

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:53.431
Professor, I'm sorry. I'm going
to have to ask for your answer.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.433
<i>It seems like an easy one.</i>

01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:09.189
<i>Leopold.</i>

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:11.654
No.

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:20.705
No, I'm... I'm sorry, Charlie.
The answer is Baudouin.

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:23.210
King Baudouin.

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:26.540
Leopold is Baudouin's father,
the former king.

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:29.217
What a stunning turn of events.

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:32.088
Mrs. Nearing, you have just
unseated our champion.

01:28:32.098 --> 01:28:33.759
<i>Baudouin. Of course.</i>

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.135
Come out here, both of you.

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:43.231
You don't know what to do?
Give him another chance, that's what.

01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:47.774
Call it a bonus round,
but get him on that show again.

01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:51.072
Someone will call if he loses,
won't they?

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:52.282
I'm sure.

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:53.741
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:55.281
Changing of the guard, as it were.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:57.784
You take home
$ 10,000 of Mr. Van Doren's money.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:00.741
We'll try not to hold that against you.
Please, come back next week.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:02.576
Tell us you want to continue playing.
I sure hope you do.

01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:04.248
How 'bout a warm hand
for our new champion,

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:06.087
- Mrs. Vivienne Nearing.
- Thank you.

01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:12.631
Whoa, who is that in our wing?
Is that Dave Garroway?

01:29:12.722 --> 01:29:16.180
Dave Garroway of the N BC
<i>Today Show,</i> ladies and gentlemen.

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:18.805
Hello, Dave.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:21.102
- How are you, Charlie?
- Fine, thank you, Dave.

01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:22.721
I was wondering,
what are you gonna do now?

01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:27.104
Well, I was hoping to
enjoy some peace and quiet now

01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:29.273
and a chance to get back to my books.

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:31.943
You know, eventually,
this sad day had to come,

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.656
but we don't wanna lose you.

01:29:33.743 --> 01:29:35.483
So, at the <i>Today Show,</i> we decided

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:38.612
why not make Charlie
our special cultural correspondent,

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:41.540
to the people and to
the schoolchildren of America.

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.742
Well, I...
I hope you're not firing the chimp.

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:49.627
How does $50,000 a year
sound to you, Professor?

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:55.636
Well, I...

01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:58.973
I was hoping to, um...
To get back to my teaching.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:03.554
Well, this is the largest classroom
in the world, Professor, television.

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:07.061
So, if you will,
just sign right here on the dotted line.

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:11.611
Charlie, walk away.
Come on. You don't need it.

01:30:15.869 --> 01:30:18.531
- Congratulations, Charlie.
- Thank you.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.536
- Did Mr. Garroway leave?
- Yes, sir.

01:30:24.628 --> 01:30:26.164
- Good show, Dave.
- Thanks.

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.415
- Mrs. Nearing, congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:29.746
It was a wonderful show.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.332
Gentlemen, this is Mrs. Nearing.
You know Al Freedman.

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:33.667
Yes, we've met.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.214
You're gonna be
needed tomorrow.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.846
You're a very disruptive young man.

01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:44.015
Okay, let's bring the camera out,
and let's bring the blackboard in.

01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:46.229
- You remember James Snodgrass?
- Who?

01:30:46.232 --> 01:30:47.688
And can we get Mrs. Nearing in there?

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:50.438
- James Snodgrass.
- Get her in there with her family.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.393
He was a contestant on your show.

01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:54.487
You know how many contestants
we've had?

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.441
This man was an artist.
Maybe that'll jog your memory.

01:30:57.535 --> 01:31:00.072
Al digs these people up.
God knows where he finds them.

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:03.030
- Now, a picture with her mother.
- He's in Greenwich Village.

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:06.082
There was a question about the first
line of a poem by Emily Dickinson.

01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:07.375
Barry apparently expected

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:09.244
he was going to say
Ralph Waldo Emerson and get it wrong.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:10.875
Really? I'm very busy now.

01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:12.747
Yeah, and I have it
on the kinescope, okay?

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:15.299
It's clear as day.
The man literally did a double take.

01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:18.754
He did a double take.
And who told you this?

01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:20.130
Is this Herb again?

01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:22.307
Or is this the Greenwich Village
beatnik?

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:23.383
That's interesting.

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:26.220
Why is he a beatnik?
Because he's not Charlie Van Doren?

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:28.893
Yeah, you're damn right.
He's not Charlie Van Doren.

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:30.724
You got crackpots
comin' out of the woodwork.

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:32.434
You're snoopin' around
askin' questions.

01:31:32.445 --> 01:31:34.276
You don't have a shred of
concrete evidence.

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.941
Let me tell you somethin'.

01:31:36.032 --> 01:31:37.943
In this envelope are all the questions

01:31:37.951 --> 01:31:40.613
that James Snodgrass was
asked on <i>Twenty-One,</i> okay?

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:44.784
The odd thing about this envelope is he
appeared on the show on January 13,

01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:48.913
yet somehow he mailed this to himself
January 11, registered mail.

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:53.087
I'd say that's pretty goddamn concrete,
wouldn't you?

01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:56.583
Look right into the camera.

01:31:58.096 --> 01:31:59.677
I wasn't in there, was I?
You didn't see me?

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:02.551
No, you were out. It's okay.

01:32:16.573 --> 01:32:18.359
Why would he do that?

01:32:19.284 --> 01:32:22.026
How's that trap feel
clamped on your leg?

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.321
He sent it to himself registered mail?

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:28.202
Why should you be the fall guy here

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:31.285
when NBC and Geritol are
makin' the real money?

01:32:34.466 --> 01:32:36.331
Dick.

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:41.294
Dan.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:44.635
You want me to implicate the network?

01:32:44.642 --> 01:32:46.758
You don't owe them a thing.

01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:51.805
If I even hinted that the network knew,

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:54.391
and they didn't know,

01:32:56.946 --> 01:32:58.732
they'd never let me
through the door again.

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:02.824
I got a sneakin' suspicion you're not
going through that door anyway.

01:33:05.914 --> 01:33:08.200
Television's my life, Dick.

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:12.079
It's over.
Why don't you go talk to your family?

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.340
I just had a thought.

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:23.006
Would you be interested
in your own panel show?

01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:28.220
Seriously.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:32.721
What?

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.817
I'll get back to you on that, Dan.

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:56.582
- Excuse the robe.
- That's all right.

01:33:56.673 --> 01:33:59.380
First decent night's sleep I've had
in months. Would you like coffee?

01:33:59.384 --> 01:34:02.968
I thought I'd drop by before I head back
to Washington. I got a 10: 00 train.

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:05.591
We're going to announce
our hearings later today.

01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:09.599
Oh, really?
As I exit the stage, you enter.

01:34:09.602 --> 01:34:12.139
Well, don't forget
the world's biggest classroom.

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:16.314
Oh, that. Well, it's...
It's the world's biggest something.

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:17.891
Uh...

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:22.066
How do you like it, Dick?
You seem like a black coffee man.

01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:24.196
Yeah, black's fine.

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.411
Here we go.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:32.246
A toast to

01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:34.957
escape.

01:34:38.214 --> 01:34:40.626
"It is the basket
in which the heart is caught

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:44.251
"when down some awful Battlement
the rest of Life is dropt."

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:45.585
King Baudouin.

01:34:48.892 --> 01:34:50.598
Emily Dickinson, actually.

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:52.425
The one you lost on.

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:55.804
Oh, that.

01:34:55.899 --> 01:35:00.313
Well, it seems the Belgian Consulate
has formally protested my ignorance.

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:05.609
Up at Cornwall, Charlie, your father
said he felt like Leopold, remember?

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:09.109
You lost on one you knew.
Same as Stempel.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.702
Well, I...
I must have had a mental block.

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:13.654
I was there last night.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:17.789
I could swear a smile crept across
your face when you lost.

01:35:20.506 --> 01:35:24.215
I wanted to get off the show.
You can understand that.

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:28.303
I feel like I've been holding
my breath for 14 weeks.

01:35:30.642 --> 01:35:32.178
Why? What'd you think it was?

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:36.352
Look, I spoke to the committee, okay?

01:35:36.439 --> 01:35:38.475
We're going to hold the hearings
without you.

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:41.182
I am not out to destroy
you or your family.

01:35:41.194 --> 01:35:42.525
You go on and you live your life,

01:35:42.612 --> 01:35:43.818
- and God bless you.
- Okay.

01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:48.406
But I wanna know, man to man,
did you get the answers?

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.823
- "Man to man"?
- Yeah, just between us.

01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:54.696
What is this?
Is this still that business with Stempel?

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:57.533
I mean, Dan says he's not
the most reliable fellow.

01:35:57.543 --> 01:35:58.749
There's a problem, Charlie.

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:01.168
I found another contestant,
a man named James Snodgrass.

01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:02.666
He says he got the answers, too.

01:36:02.674 --> 01:36:04.414
Are you sure
these people are telling the truth?

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:06.215
He put the questions
in a sealed envelope

01:36:06.219 --> 01:36:08.005
and sent them to himself,
registered mail.

01:36:08.012 --> 01:36:09.548
That was two days before
he appeared on the show.

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:10.845
That doesn't prove anything.

01:36:10.848 --> 01:36:12.554
You don't have to be a genius
to connect the dots.

01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:13.718
Don't connect them through me.

01:36:13.810 --> 01:36:16.552
Don't treat me like I'm some member
of your goddamned fan club.

01:36:16.646 --> 01:36:19.058
Are you telling me
everybody got the answers but you?

01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:21.104
You're so persistent. I envy that.

01:36:21.192 --> 01:36:22.398
Was it just the money?

01:36:22.485 --> 01:36:23.725
You'll forgive me,
but anyone that thinks

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.567
money is ever just money
couldn't have much of it.

01:36:25.655 --> 01:36:29.239
You wanna insult me, fine.
But you can't envy me at the same time.

01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:33.781
Jesus. If someone offered you all this
money to be on some rigged quiz show,

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:35.827
instant fame, would you do it?

01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:39.032
- No. Of course not.
- No, no.

01:36:39.127 --> 01:36:41.243
Throw the whole thing in.
Cover of <i>Time,</i> Dave Garroway,

01:36:41.254 --> 01:36:44.246
50,000 to read poetry on TV,
would you do it?

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:47.878
No.

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:49.379
And I would?

01:36:56.102 --> 01:36:58.013
Honestly, Dick.

01:37:03.401 --> 01:37:04.732
All right.

01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:08.437
Look, do me a favor.
Don't embarrass me.

01:37:08.531 --> 01:37:11.773
Keep your mouth shut. Don't say
anything. Don't talk to the papers.

01:37:11.868 --> 01:37:13.859
Just disappear for two weeks.

01:37:14.704 --> 01:37:16.365
Please, don't make me call you.

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:25.127
More coffee, Dick?

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:28.999
Nope. I better go.

01:37:29.552 --> 01:37:31.668
I don't wanna miss my train.

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:39.725
The subcommittee
will be in order.

01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:45.106
The special Subcommittee
on Legislative Oversight

01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:47.942
was created pursuant to Section 136

01:37:47.945 --> 01:37:51.779
of the Legislative
Reorganization Act of 1946

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:54.824
to conduct a general investigation
into the operation

01:37:54.827 --> 01:37:57.819
of the federal regulatory agencies.

01:37:57.830 --> 01:38:01.118
I'll ask if you were assisted in any way.
You answer, "Yes." I'll say, "How?"

01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:04.121
You say, "I was given the questions
and answers in advance."

01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:07.336
- Why don't you just sit on my pants?
- I'll ask, "Was this done routinely?"

01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:10.673
- You answer, "Yes."
- Not that tie. The television tie.

01:38:14.013 --> 01:38:16.629
We've gone over this five times already.

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:18.635
Just try to relax.

01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:21.009
Be confident. Look at the Chairman
directly when you answer.

01:38:21.104 --> 01:38:24.392
Enough. You're worse than Enright.
I'm telling the truth.

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:27.519
If they prefer to be lied to,
they can just turn on the television.

01:38:27.527 --> 01:38:28.858
There's a lot riding on this.

01:38:28.945 --> 01:38:32.312
You're telling me
there's a lot riding on it, yeah.

01:38:32.323 --> 01:38:35.156
- What do you think, Toby?
- What do I think about what?

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:36.899
Ready to watch your husband
give 'em hell?

01:38:36.994 --> 01:38:38.359
I don't know
what you're gonna accomplish.

01:38:38.454 --> 01:38:39.819
As soon as Enright realizes...

01:38:39.831 --> 01:38:41.696
What do you want,
the two-tone or the oxford?

01:38:41.707 --> 01:38:42.992
You should wear the oxford.

01:38:44.001 --> 01:38:47.334
When Enright realizes he's alone up
there and they're gonna cut him loose,

01:38:47.338 --> 01:38:49.329
he will implicate N BC and Geritol
like that,

01:38:49.424 --> 01:38:50.834
and believe me,
you're gonna see somethin'.

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:53.587
I know what you're gonna accomplish.

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:55.418
I just don't know
what he's gonna accomplish.

01:38:55.513 --> 01:38:58.926
You wanna know what? If I do
nothing else, I will convince them

01:38:59.016 --> 01:39:02.850
that Herbert Stempel knows what won
the goddamned Academy Award

01:39:02.937 --> 01:39:05.098
for best goddamned picture of 1955.

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:08.101
- That's what I'm going to accomplish.
- I'm sick of all this.

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:12.060
The subcommittee calls
Herbert Stempel.

01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:25.789
So, in other words,
you kept on winning.

01:39:25.877 --> 01:39:27.208
Yes, sir, that is correct.

01:39:27.295 --> 01:39:29.877
At any time
during this championship run,

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:31.872
were you ever assisted in any way?

01:39:31.966 --> 01:39:35.049
I was given
the questions and answers in advance.

01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:38.260
Generally, I would receive the questions
and answers on Friday.

01:39:38.347 --> 01:39:40.759
Then we'd have sort of
a rehearsal on Monday.

01:39:40.766 --> 01:39:43.428
- This is from the very beginning?
- Yes.

01:39:43.436 --> 01:39:47.145
Dan Enright came to see me
in my kitchen and he said,

01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:51.975
"How'd you like to make $25,000?"
And I said, "Who wouldn't?"

01:39:52.069 --> 01:39:53.934
What do you mean by rehearsal?

01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:58.273
Well, for example, he told me how to
breathe heavily into the microphone

01:39:58.367 --> 01:40:00.733
and sigh such as this.

01:40:05.374 --> 01:40:07.990
He taught me how to stutter
and say in a plaintive voice,

01:40:08.085 --> 01:40:11.953
"I will take, nine... Nine points."

01:40:11.964 --> 01:40:13.295
It was all choreographed.

01:40:13.299 --> 01:40:16.587
How to bite my lip.
How to mop my brow.

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:19.293
He told me specifically
not to smear my brow,

01:40:19.305 --> 01:40:21.512
but rather to pat for optimum effect.

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:23.430
Of course, I'm shvitzing the whole time

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:24.924
because they turned off
the air conditioning.

01:40:24.936 --> 01:40:26.972
Excuse me?

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:30.809
- That's funny.
- Mr. Chairman.

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:35.185
With your permission,
we might at this point,

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:37.315
view a portion of the program,
<i>Twenty-One.</i>

01:40:37.323 --> 01:40:38.813
Whenever you're ready.

01:40:48.292 --> 01:40:52.285
<i>Herb Stempel, with your $69, 500</i>
<i>still at stake,</i>

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:56.464
<i>although now at $2, 500 a point,</i>
<i>the category is...</i>

01:40:57.635 --> 01:40:58.875
<i>Newspapers.</i>

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:01.336
<i>How many points you wanna try for?</i>

01:41:01.847 --> 01:41:04.634
There. There's the lip biting.

01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:05.973
Yes, we see.

01:41:06.936 --> 01:41:10.303
Finally, I was told to open my eyes

01:41:10.314 --> 01:41:12.805
and with a dazzling smile,
give the answer

01:41:12.817 --> 01:41:15.524
and explode when Jack Barry says,
"That is right."

01:41:15.861 --> 01:41:17.442
The Emporia Gazette?

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:19.562
<i>That is right.</i>

01:41:21.993 --> 01:41:23.153
I don't know where he got it all.

01:41:23.244 --> 01:41:26.236
Some article on mass psychology
he read in <i>Esquire.</i>

01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:34.411
<i>- I'll try eight points.</i>
- Watch Van Doren.

01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:38.589
- He's better at it than I am.
- Mr. Stempel, if I might refer you...

01:41:38.676 --> 01:41:41.383
Are you suggesting that
Charles Van Doren was also coached?

01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:42.505
Of course he got the answers.

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:44.838
Why would they give me the answers
and not give him the answers?

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.217
Why would they make me take a dive

01:41:46.225 --> 01:41:48.762
unless they knew
the other guy would get to 21?

01:41:48.853 --> 01:41:52.345
It's illogical. You don't fix one guy
without fixing the other guy.

01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:55.018
It's implausible, mathematically.

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:58.400
<i>It would be,</i>
<i>and you have eight points.</i>

01:41:59.363 --> 01:42:01.695
You see? Look at him.
You see with the brow?

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:03.860
Patting, not smearing.

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:08.991
Mr. Stempel, have you ever received
any psychiatric treatment of any kind?

01:42:10.374 --> 01:42:11.409
What?

01:42:12.043 --> 01:42:15.501
- Mr. Stempel, I was wondering...
- Mr. Goodwin, please.

01:42:16.047 --> 01:42:19.756
Five sessions a week.
That's pretty extensive, isn't it?

01:42:19.842 --> 01:42:23.881
Well, I believe we can all use a little
help at various times in our lives.

01:42:23.888 --> 01:42:26.470
Is it possible that any of
your testimony is motivated

01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:30.550
by an irrational animosity
toward Mr. Enright?

01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:33.974
I don't know. If a man doesn't
live up to his agreement...

01:42:34.065 --> 01:42:36.602
A morbid fixation on Mr. Van Doren?

01:42:36.692 --> 01:42:39.604
If a man promises certain things
just to shut me up...

01:42:39.695 --> 01:42:43.438
"How'd you like to make $25,000?"
And you said, "Well, who wouldn't?"

01:42:43.532 --> 01:42:47.445
In retrospect, look at Van Doren.
I should've held out for a lot more.

01:42:47.453 --> 01:42:50.695
You prostituted
your intellectual ability for money.

01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:53.156
That's the difference
between me and Van Doren.

01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:55.241
I admit it. I have my morality.

01:42:55.252 --> 01:42:58.915
Charles Van Doren is a professor
at Columbia University.

01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:02.047
A Master's degree in astrophysics.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.591
A Ph. D. In literature.

01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:10.056
Hails from one of the most prominent
intellectual families in this country.

01:43:11.227 --> 01:43:13.764
Isn't it just possible, Mr. Stempel,

01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:17.396
that you got the answers and he didn't?

01:43:26.909 --> 01:43:29.821
So I told my husband,
"We really need a vacation."

01:43:29.912 --> 01:43:31.868
My husband says,
"What are you gonna do with the cat?"

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:33.696
- Uh-huh.
- And I said, "I don't know."

01:43:33.791 --> 01:43:35.247
Good morning.

01:43:36.127 --> 01:43:37.867
Will you excuse us?

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:43.464
Charlie, I'm Bob Kintner.

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:45.712
- Oh.
- Don't get up.

01:43:45.803 --> 01:43:48.465
- It's about time we met.
- Hi. It's a pleasure.

01:43:48.472 --> 01:43:52.181
This whole quiz show mess,
and hearings and all that.

01:43:52.268 --> 01:43:55.135
I've been following that in the paper.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:59.017
Well, our legal department
has prepared this for you.

01:44:08.325 --> 01:44:11.067
We'd like you to hold
a press conference.

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:15.238
Oh, there's a split infinitive
here in the second paragraph.

01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:19.450
Shall I schedule it?

01:44:21.005 --> 01:44:22.916
Well, look, um...

01:44:23.007 --> 01:44:24.747
I haven't been subpoenaed,

01:44:24.842 --> 01:44:27.379
and I can't think of
anything that'd sound guiltier

01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:31.054
than a man who hasn't been accused
of anything protesting his innocence.

01:44:33.684 --> 01:44:38.849
Charlie, speculation in our society
has a way of becoming fact.

01:44:41.734 --> 01:44:44.567
Television is a public trust.

01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:48.897
We can't afford even a hint of
a scandal in our company.

01:44:52.495 --> 01:44:55.032
Well, I... I'd rather not do it.

01:44:55.831 --> 01:44:57.241
I'm sorry.

01:44:59.293 --> 01:45:01.409
Haven't we been good to you?

01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:06.164
Haven't we treated you
like part of our family?

01:45:08.761 --> 01:45:11.673
We have great expectations
for you, Charlie.

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:16.928
I know you're gonna do the right thing.

01:45:40.292 --> 01:45:42.783
- I'm sorry, Mr. Van Doren.
- Is he in?

01:45:43.754 --> 01:45:46.086
- He's gone, Mr. Van Doren.
- He's gone to Washington?

01:45:46.757 --> 01:45:48.793
Mr. Freedman's gone to Mexico.

01:45:55.558 --> 01:45:56.638
I still don't understand

01:45:56.725 --> 01:45:58.841
how you can hold a quiz show hearing
without Van Doren.

01:45:58.936 --> 01:46:01.803
Van Doren had no contact
with NBC or Geritol.

01:46:01.814 --> 01:46:03.099
Don't you understand,

01:46:03.107 --> 01:46:05.314
they deal with Enright.
Enright's the key here.

01:46:05.401 --> 01:46:07.642
The key to what?
The jury hears the public.

01:46:07.736 --> 01:46:09.272
The public doesn't know Dan Enright.

01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:11.274
The purpose is not to
reform the souls of the contestants.

01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:12.772
The purpose is to reform TV.

01:46:12.783 --> 01:46:14.614
It's like the Barenblatt and
the Sweezy cases.

01:46:14.702 --> 01:46:15.817
You don't wanna call him.

01:46:15.911 --> 01:46:18.323
Fine, Dick. Just don't patronize me
with your legal bullshit.

01:46:18.414 --> 01:46:19.824
She's got a point, Dick.

01:46:19.832 --> 01:46:22.289
Bob, maybe it's time for you to go home.

01:46:22.376 --> 01:46:24.332
How'd you like Dick's steak
done, Bob? Medium?

01:46:24.336 --> 01:46:26.452
There's absolutely no need to
drag the man into the spotlight.

01:46:26.463 --> 01:46:28.203
You dragged Herb Stempel in.

01:46:28.299 --> 01:46:29.664
The man has to be

01:46:29.758 --> 01:46:31.840
dragged from the spotlight
with his teethmarks still on it.

01:46:31.927 --> 01:46:33.042
Yeah, well, nobody forced

01:46:33.137 --> 01:46:35.344
Charles Van Doren to go in front of
50 million people either.

01:46:35.431 --> 01:46:38.798
This is not McCarthyism. We are not
here to expose for the sake of exposing.

01:46:38.809 --> 01:46:42.051
- This is not the point.
- That is the point. That is not your point.

01:46:42.146 --> 01:46:45.684
You are ten times the man
Charles Van Doren is.

01:46:45.774 --> 01:46:49.141
Ten times the brain
and ten times the human being.

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:51.852
Meanwhile, you're bending
over backwards for him.

01:46:51.864 --> 01:46:54.526
You are like the Uncle Tom of the Jews.

01:46:56.035 --> 01:46:58.196
I'm glad it's so easy for you
to destroy a man's life.

01:46:58.203 --> 01:46:59.534
I'll have to keep that in mind.

01:47:00.873 --> 01:47:02.488
Bob, sit down.

01:47:04.793 --> 01:47:06.533
The quiz show hearings
without Van Doren

01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:08.620
is like doing <i>Hamlet</i> without Hamlet.

01:47:13.802 --> 01:47:14.882
The Chairman's instructions

01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:17.211
are for me to get you up there
as promptly as possible.

01:47:17.222 --> 01:47:19.383
The questions are to take
no longer than 15 minutes.

01:47:19.391 --> 01:47:21.006
You're to receive
the questions in advance,

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:24.389
and I'm to thank you for the courtesy
of attending this hearing.

01:47:28.067 --> 01:47:31.104
Mercy. What a grueling line of inquiry.

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:35.238
Must have a familiar ring,
the questions in advance.

01:47:38.077 --> 01:47:40.819
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

01:47:43.666 --> 01:47:45.873
Take this, please. Thank you.

01:47:49.254 --> 01:47:51.540
Young man...

01:47:51.632 --> 01:47:54.920
The ratings went up if the same
contestant came back week after week.

01:47:54.927 --> 01:47:58.169
There was only one way for that
to happen. You had to know that.

01:47:58.722 --> 01:48:02.556
Young man, I sell over $ 14 million
a year worth of Geritol.

01:48:02.559 --> 01:48:05.551
Geritol. That's the kind
of businessman I am.

01:48:05.688 --> 01:48:09.101
That show, <i>Twenty-One,</i> cost me three
and a half million year in, year out.

01:48:09.108 --> 01:48:12.692
Sales went up 50%
when Van Doren was on. 50%.

01:48:14.238 --> 01:48:18.823
So the very idea that I was unaware of
every detail of that show's operation,

01:48:19.535 --> 01:48:21.617
frankly, it's very insulting.

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.451
- So you knew.
- That's even more insulting.

01:48:23.539 --> 01:48:25.279
- You had to know...
- It's not about what I know.

01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:26.325
It's about what you know.

01:48:26.417 --> 01:48:27.907
You don't know what I know.

01:48:27.918 --> 01:48:29.954
You know that Dan Enright
ran a crooked quiz show.

01:48:29.962 --> 01:48:31.327
He never informed you?

01:48:33.424 --> 01:48:34.630
Did he?

01:48:34.717 --> 01:48:36.673
Let's see what he says.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:42.005
Dan? Look, Dan Enright wants
a future in television, okay?

01:48:42.099 --> 01:48:45.262
You have to understand that the public
has a very short memory.

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:47.468
But corporations, they never forget.

01:48:47.479 --> 01:48:50.141
He's not that stupid.
He knows he's through.

01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:54.392
No. He'll be back. NBC is gonna go on.
Geritol's gonna go on.

01:48:55.279 --> 01:48:57.440
Makes me wonder what you hope
to accomplish with all this.

01:48:57.531 --> 01:48:59.362
Don't worry. I'm just gettin' started.

01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:02.612
Even the quiz shows'll be back.
Why fix them?

01:49:02.703 --> 01:49:04.034
Think about it.

01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:07.113
You could do exactly the same thing
by just making the questions easier.

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:08.367
The audience didn't tune in

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:11.292
to watch some amazing
display of intellectual ability.

01:49:13.839 --> 01:49:17.002
They just wanted to watch the money.

01:49:17.009 --> 01:49:19.625
Imagine if they could watch you.

01:49:22.514 --> 01:49:26.803
You're a bright young kid with a bright
future. Watch yourself out there.

01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:29.803
I turned in my clubs after that day.

01:49:29.897 --> 01:49:32.183
Well, you weren't too good
when you were out on the links

01:49:32.274 --> 01:49:33.514
with me that day.

01:49:33.525 --> 01:49:35.311
I can't wait to get you out there again.

01:49:36.445 --> 01:49:39.152
- Stuck in that sand trap for an hour.
- No more for me.

01:49:39.281 --> 01:49:42.648
Would you state your name
and profession?

01:49:42.743 --> 01:49:44.654
My name is Robert Kintner.

01:49:44.661 --> 01:49:47.152
I'm the president of the
National Broadcasting Company.

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:50.739
My name is Martin Rittenhome.
I run Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.

01:49:50.834 --> 01:49:53.496
I take that responsibility
very seriously, Congressman.

01:49:53.504 --> 01:49:56.496
We immediately commenced
our own internal investigation.

01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:59.332
To ferret out this corruption
wherever it may exist.

01:49:59.343 --> 01:50:02.210
Nobody brought the article
in <i>Time</i> magazine to your attention?

01:50:02.346 --> 01:50:04.382
I was in Europe. I didn't see it.

01:50:04.973 --> 01:50:06.759
You didn't see it. You were traveling.

01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:08.511
I didn't see it.
I was traveling at the time.

01:50:08.519 --> 01:50:11.056
You sure you never asked
about particular contestants

01:50:11.146 --> 01:50:12.852
or about the ratings, nothing?

01:50:12.981 --> 01:50:14.346
That was their department.

01:50:14.358 --> 01:50:17.191
I relied on the excellent reputation
of Dan Enright.

01:50:17.194 --> 01:50:19.936
Dan Enright was more in the nature
of an independent contractor.

01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:22.612
Do you remember what you thought
when you found out?

01:50:22.699 --> 01:50:24.030
I was as shocked as you are. I mean,

01:50:24.118 --> 01:50:25.904
this was a terrible thing to do
to the American people.

01:50:25.911 --> 01:50:28.197
I never, never imagined

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:31.746
they could perpetrate this fraud
on the American public.

01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:35.709
I'd like to say one other thing. I
think all that money should be returned.

01:50:36.547 --> 01:50:39.539
Mr. Goodwin, any further questions?

01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:44.339
No, sir, thank you. No further questions.

01:50:47.808 --> 01:50:50.299
<i>On behalf of the subcommittee,</i>

01:50:50.394 --> 01:50:52.601
<i>I wish to thank you</i>
<i>for your appearance</i>

01:50:52.688 --> 01:50:55.225
<i>and your testimony here.</i>

01:51:05.617 --> 01:51:07.482
Van Doren's made a statement.

01:51:07.578 --> 01:51:11.787
I look like the mark in a shell game
here, and you look like the shill.

01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:14.281
- Sir, if you...
- Shut up.

01:51:14.293 --> 01:51:15.749
When is Van Doren coming here?

01:51:15.836 --> 01:51:18.077
- I don't see him on the schedule.
- He's not on the schedule.

01:51:18.172 --> 01:51:20.629
Wait a minute. We discussed this.
The contestants are not the villains.

01:51:20.632 --> 01:51:22.839
We were gonna only bring in the ones
who would come in voluntarily.

01:51:22.926 --> 01:51:24.587
All I know is in the last hour,

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:27.132
I've gotten over 200 telegrams
from people askin' me

01:51:27.139 --> 01:51:29.926
why I won't let poor
Charles Van Doren defend himself.

01:51:29.933 --> 01:51:33.175
I've got every woman in Arkadelphia
squealin' like a pig under a gate.

01:51:33.312 --> 01:51:34.802
Let me tell you somethin'.
These women vote.

01:51:34.938 --> 01:51:36.474
I cannot believe this.

01:51:36.565 --> 01:51:38.271
Where is Albert Freedman?

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:40.098
The marshals are bringing him
back from Mexico.

01:51:40.402 --> 01:51:41.858
By what? By mule?

01:51:41.945 --> 01:51:44.687
Sir, please, just tell me
what it is that he said.

01:51:45.908 --> 01:51:48.945
"Mr. Van Doren made himself
available to the subcommittee staff.

01:51:49.077 --> 01:51:51.614
"He has advised them at no time
was he supplied

01:51:51.622 --> 01:51:54.455
"with any questions, answers..."

01:52:18.899 --> 01:52:21.185
That statement of yours
took me a bit by surprise.

01:52:21.276 --> 01:52:23.312
I know. I know. We had a deal.

01:52:23.403 --> 01:52:26.736
I asked myself, "Why would he make
a statement like that?

01:52:27.074 --> 01:52:30.487
"He knows I'll come after him."

01:52:30.494 --> 01:52:33.201
But then it occurred to me.

01:52:33.205 --> 01:52:36.072
He knows I'll come after him.

01:52:38.293 --> 01:52:42.411
I can't decide if you think
too much of me or too little.

01:52:42.714 --> 01:52:45.922
Charlie, I wanna think the best of you.

01:52:46.009 --> 01:52:48.625
Everyone does.

01:52:48.804 --> 01:52:51.511
That's your curse.

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:55.508
- Did you bring a subpoena?
- Right here.

01:52:58.355 --> 01:53:00.220
Well?

01:53:02.859 --> 01:53:05.896
I remember five, six years ago,
my Uncle Harold told my aunt

01:53:06.029 --> 01:53:07.860
about this affair he had.

01:53:07.948 --> 01:53:10.189
It was a sort of mildly
upsetting event in my family.

01:53:10.284 --> 01:53:12.115
Mmm-hmm. Mildly?

01:53:12.286 --> 01:53:14.197
You have to put it in context.

01:53:14.288 --> 01:53:17.075
The thing of it is, the affair
was over like eight years.

01:53:17.082 --> 01:53:21.451
So, I remember askin' him, "Why'd you
tell her? You got away with it."

01:53:21.586 --> 01:53:24.669
I'll never forget what he said.

01:53:25.882 --> 01:53:28.874
It was the "getting away with it"
part he couldn't live with.

01:53:31.763 --> 01:53:33.754
I might take that chance.

01:53:37.561 --> 01:53:40.894
A chance is what I'm givin' ya.

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:46.437
- Don Quixote is life.
- I still don't see

01:53:46.445 --> 01:53:51.235
how this old guy with a horse and a fat
old sidekick can think he's a knight.

01:53:51.241 --> 01:53:53.903
It means if you wanna be
a knight, act like a knight.

01:53:53.994 --> 01:53:55.734
Okay.

01:53:55.829 --> 01:53:58.741
Act like a knight? You act like a knight.

01:53:58.832 --> 01:54:01.289
I am a knight.

01:54:01.376 --> 01:54:02.741
I shall miss them.

01:54:02.836 --> 01:54:05.452
What is this?
That retirement business again?

01:54:05.464 --> 01:54:08.627
That'd be like a snail
retiring from his shell.

01:54:08.717 --> 01:54:13.586
I can't go on doing this forever.
It's for you now, Charlie.

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:16.763
So, what's the news? Did you
read Norman Mailer in <i>Dissent?</i>

01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:18.590
I only glanced at it.

01:54:18.769 --> 01:54:22.762
Everyone's talking about it. They don't
know whether he's a genius or a fool.

01:54:22.939 --> 01:54:25.931
Have you heard there's this
congressional committee that's...

01:54:26.026 --> 01:54:28.062
Well, they're investigating
the quiz shows.

01:54:28.153 --> 01:54:30.269
I read that. What's it about?

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:32.817
Well, evidently,
certain of the contestants

01:54:32.908 --> 01:54:35.490
were given the answers in advance.

01:54:35.619 --> 01:54:39.703
Cheating on a quiz show.
That's like plagiarizing a comic strip.

01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:42.532
Well, at any rate, it seems
the committee wants to call me

01:54:42.626 --> 01:54:43.832
to testify.

01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:47.544
Oh, I've testified before.
Funding for the arts. It's nothing.

01:54:47.672 --> 01:54:51.540
- I think this is a little different.
- You'll run circles round them.

01:54:51.676 --> 01:54:54.258
It's not exactly Jefferson
and Lincoln down there anymore.

01:54:54.388 --> 01:54:56.549
I think this is a little different.

01:54:56.681 --> 01:54:59.514
I'd think you'd be glad
at a chance to clear your name.

01:54:59.601 --> 01:55:00.966
Otherwise, people might believe...

01:55:01.061 --> 01:55:04.098
People will believe whatever they
want to believe. That's not the issue.

01:55:04.439 --> 01:55:07.021
Just tell 'em the truth. You'll do fine.

01:55:07.025 --> 01:55:09.892
The real issue, Charlie,
is how this keeps distracting you

01:55:10.028 --> 01:55:11.017
from your teaching.

01:55:11.154 --> 01:55:14.362
This and that program in the morning,
though you insist that it doesn't.

01:55:14.366 --> 01:55:17.324
Dad, I can't simply just tell 'em the truth.

01:55:20.205 --> 01:55:22.696
Can't tell them the truth?

01:55:23.333 --> 01:55:25.324
Why on earth not?

01:55:25.961 --> 01:55:27.292
It's complicated.

01:55:28.839 --> 01:55:30.329
Complicated?

01:55:30.632 --> 01:55:33.965
Yeah, I can't. I...

01:55:34.719 --> 01:55:37.210
Charlie, from what I understand,
it's just this bunch of frauds

01:55:37.305 --> 01:55:40.263
showing off an erudition
they didn't really have.

01:55:40.976 --> 01:55:42.841
- All you have to do...
- The problem is

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:45.769
it seems I was one of those frauds.

01:55:47.524 --> 01:55:49.355
What?

01:55:58.201 --> 01:56:00.567
What... What do you mean?

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:04.325
They gave me the answers.

01:56:04.749 --> 01:56:07.616
They gave you the answers.

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.535
They gave you the answers.

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:12.871
Well... No, no.

01:56:12.883 --> 01:56:16.421
At first, they asked me questions they
already knew I knew the answers to.

01:56:16.428 --> 01:56:18.089
We ran through those, and I still
didn't want them

01:56:18.096 --> 01:56:19.552
to give me the answers,

01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:22.597
so I had them give me questions
and I'd go look up the answers,

01:56:22.726 --> 01:56:24.057
as if that were any different.

01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:26.176
We ran through those
in a couple of weeks.

01:56:26.271 --> 01:56:29.638
Then I just didn't have the time.
Finally, it just seemed silly.

01:56:29.733 --> 01:56:33.726
They gave you all that money to answer
questions they knew you knew?

01:56:33.737 --> 01:56:36.399
- Now, that's inflation.
- You're not being very helpful.

01:56:36.490 --> 01:56:38.731
I'm sorry, Charlie. I'm an old man.

01:56:38.825 --> 01:56:40.565
It's all a little difficult
for me to comprehend.

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:43.242
It's television, Dad. It's just television.

01:56:43.246 --> 01:56:45.111
You make it sound like
you didn't have a choice.

01:56:45.248 --> 01:56:46.454
What was I supposed
to do at that point?

01:56:46.541 --> 01:56:47.951
Disillusion the whole
goddamn country?

01:56:47.959 --> 01:56:50.826
- You took the money.
- Yes, I know. I took the money.

01:56:50.921 --> 01:56:55.039
- Is that what this was about?
- No. No. I don't know.

01:56:55.425 --> 01:56:58.132
It was a goddamned quiz show, Charlie.

01:56:58.261 --> 01:57:01.628
- "An ill-favored thing, sir."
- This is not the time to play games.

01:57:01.723 --> 01:57:06.308
- "But mine own." It was mine.
- Your name is mine.

01:57:21.409 --> 01:57:24.116
Charlie.

01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:31.829
I'm sorry.

01:57:33.129 --> 01:57:35.620
I'm really sorry, Dad.

01:57:36.967 --> 01:57:39.174
You'll be

01:57:40.303 --> 01:57:44.296
dragged into all this, you and Mother.

01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:48.967
Oh, my God, Charlie.

01:57:49.104 --> 01:57:52.767
How are you gonna tell that committee?

01:57:55.527 --> 01:57:57.563
Will you come down there with me?

01:58:02.033 --> 01:58:05.491
<i>The, uh, subcommittee</i>
<i>calls Charles Van Doren.</i>

01:58:30.478 --> 01:58:32.890
Photographers will please
clear the room.

01:58:34.190 --> 01:58:37.227
- Will you please state your name?
- Charles Van Doren.

01:58:37.235 --> 01:58:39.692
I've gotta get in there.
I've gotta get in there.

01:58:39.821 --> 01:58:41.903
Excuse me, sir.

01:58:41.906 --> 01:58:45.023
Wait a minute.
Hey, you, come back here.

01:58:45.035 --> 01:58:46.525
<i>Do you solemnly swear</i>
<i>that the testimony</i>

01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:48.531
<i>you are about to give will be the truth,</i>

01:58:48.538 --> 01:58:50.779
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

01:58:50.874 --> 01:58:51.863
I do.

01:58:59.591 --> 01:59:01.923
Now, we are advised that you have

01:59:02.052 --> 01:59:06.216
a prepared statement that you would
prefer to give at the outset?

01:59:06.348 --> 01:59:08.634
Yes, sir.
Might I first have a glass of water?

01:59:08.725 --> 01:59:10.181
Of course you may.

01:59:21.738 --> 01:59:23.478
You may proceed.

01:59:33.416 --> 01:59:35.828
I would give almost anything I have

01:59:35.919 --> 01:59:39.252
to reverse the course of my life
in the last year.

01:59:41.216 --> 01:59:44.504
The past doesn't change for anyone.

01:59:44.969 --> 01:59:47.927
But at least I can learn from the past.

01:59:49.307 --> 01:59:52.174
I've learned a lot about life.

01:59:52.602 --> 01:59:54.934
I've learned a lot about myself

01:59:56.439 --> 02:00:00.398
and about the responsibilities
any man has to his fellow men.

02:00:02.278 --> 02:00:04.439
I've learned a lot about good and evil.

02:00:04.447 --> 02:00:06.608
They're not always
what they appear to be.

02:00:10.829 --> 02:00:13.286
I was involved,

02:00:14.374 --> 02:00:17.457
deeply involved, in a deception.

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:21.081
I have deceived my friends.

02:00:22.966 --> 02:00:26.299
And I had millions of them.

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:35.634
I lied to the American people.

02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:42.558
I lied about what I knew, and then
I lied about what I did not know.

02:00:45.989 --> 02:00:47.854
In a sense, I was like a child

02:00:47.866 --> 02:00:50.949
who refuses to admit a fact
in the hope that it'll go away.

02:00:52.662 --> 02:00:55.654
Of course it did not go away.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.991
I was scared,

02:01:00.503 --> 02:01:02.084
scared to death.

02:01:03.506 --> 02:01:05.042
I had no solid position.

02:01:05.049 --> 02:01:08.337
No basis to stand on for myself.

02:01:08.428 --> 02:01:13.548
There was one way out and that was
simply to tell the truth.

02:01:18.271 --> 02:01:19.727
It may sound trite to you,

02:01:19.814 --> 02:01:22.977
but I've found myself again
after a number of years.

02:01:24.861 --> 02:01:27.819
I've been acting a role,

02:01:29.866 --> 02:01:32.699
maybe all my life,
of thinking I've done more,

02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:37.328
accomplished more,
produced more than I have.

02:01:39.375 --> 02:01:42.412
I have had all the breaks.

02:01:45.548 --> 02:01:47.630
I have stood on the shoulders of life,

02:01:47.717 --> 02:01:51.255
and I've never gotten down
into the dirt to build,

02:01:51.387 --> 02:01:54.345
to erect a foundation of my own.

02:01:56.351 --> 02:01:59.468
I have flown too high
on borrowed wings.

02:02:03.024 --> 02:02:05.857
Everything came too easy.

02:02:07.904 --> 02:02:10.862
That is why I am here today.

02:02:19.666 --> 02:02:21.782
Mr. Van Doren,

02:02:22.085 --> 02:02:25.248
I want to compliment you
for that statement.

02:02:26.965 --> 02:02:28.830
Thank you, sir.

02:02:28.967 --> 02:02:32.801
Mr. Van Doren, I would like to join
the Chairman in commending you

02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:38.469
for the soul-searching fortitude
displayed in your statement.

02:02:38.476 --> 02:02:41.809
- Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
- Mr. Van Doren,

02:02:41.813 --> 02:02:43.929
I just wanna add my kudos.

02:02:44.524 --> 02:02:48.187
I have listened to many
witnesses, in both civil

02:02:48.278 --> 02:02:50.018
and criminal matters,

02:02:50.113 --> 02:02:53.196
and yours is the most
soul-searching confession

02:02:53.283 --> 02:02:55.524
I think I've heard in a long time.

02:02:55.618 --> 02:02:57.609
Thank you, sir.

02:02:57.787 --> 02:03:00.073
Mr. Van Doren,

02:03:00.874 --> 02:03:04.458
I'm also from New York,
a different part of New York.

02:03:05.628 --> 02:03:07.459
I'm happy
that you've made the statement,

02:03:07.547 --> 02:03:09.788
but I cannot agree
with most of my colleagues.

02:03:11.301 --> 02:03:14.885
You see, I don't think an adult of your
intelligence ought to be commended

02:03:14.971 --> 02:03:17.963
for simply at long last telling the truth.

02:03:51.049 --> 02:03:56.260
If the committee has nothing to add,
Mr. Van Doren, you are dismissed.

02:04:04.479 --> 02:04:06.891
Charlie. Over here.

02:04:18.952 --> 02:04:20.738
Let him out, boys.

02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:32.041
The subcommittee will come to order.

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.209
Our next witness will be
Mr. Daniel Enright.

02:04:45.895 --> 02:04:47.931
Charles, you're gonna have to
answer some questions.

02:04:47.939 --> 02:04:49.179
Okay, one at a time.

02:04:49.565 --> 02:04:52.272
- How do you feel, Charlie?
- Relieved.

02:04:52.443 --> 02:04:55.025
...the truth, the whole truth and
nothin' but the truth, so help you God?

02:04:55.113 --> 02:04:57.195
- I do.
- Who helped you write that statement?

02:04:57.323 --> 02:04:59.405
Did you know you'd been fired by N BC?

02:05:00.451 --> 02:05:01.987
No, I didn't know.

02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.951
What do you have to say
to the young people?

02:05:03.955 --> 02:05:05.661
Are you proud of your son?

02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:08.907
- I've always been proud of Charlie.
- Proud of what he did?

02:05:09.085 --> 02:05:12.327
The most important thing now is for
Charlie to get back to his teaching.

02:05:12.422 --> 02:05:14.583
Did you know Columbia trustees
are meeting right now?

02:05:14.799 --> 02:05:16.915
They're going to ask
for Charlie's resignation.

02:05:20.221 --> 02:05:22.633
Professor Van Doren, you spent
your whole career at Columbia.

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:24.631
What's your reaction to that?

02:05:26.102 --> 02:05:27.967
Prof. Van Doren?

02:05:31.607 --> 02:05:33.814
Dad, go ahead with Mother.
I'll meet you outside.

02:05:33.943 --> 02:05:36.059
- No reaction.
- Charles, a few more questions.

02:05:38.781 --> 02:05:42.239
Did the network or sponsor
bring pressure on you

02:05:42.326 --> 02:05:45.238
to bring the same contestant
back week after week?

02:05:45.329 --> 02:05:46.739
No, sir.

02:05:47.123 --> 02:05:49.114
Did they express any approval

02:05:49.125 --> 02:05:51.241
or disapproval
of any particular contestant?

02:05:51.794 --> 02:05:53.785
Never. Not to me.

02:05:54.297 --> 02:05:55.377
Were they aware

02:05:55.465 --> 02:05:58.923
that you were supplying
the contestants with the answers?

02:06:00.344 --> 02:06:04.257
No, sir.
They had no knowledge whatsoever.

02:06:04.474 --> 02:06:08.717
Herb Stempel. Herbie, how 'bout
a picture, you and Van Doren together?

02:06:08.811 --> 02:06:11.018
No. Not now. Christ, look at the guy.

02:06:11.105 --> 02:06:12.311
Come on, the both of you.

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:14.354
You know what the problem
with you bums is?

02:06:14.484 --> 02:06:17.021
You never leave a guy alone
unless you're leaving him alone.

02:06:17.028 --> 02:06:19.565
- Who do you blame, Charlie?
- Professor, one more shot.

02:06:20.698 --> 02:06:22.313
Did you feel the committee
treated you fairly?

02:06:22.325 --> 02:06:24.566
How'd the pressure up there
compare to <i>Twenty-One?</i>

02:06:24.702 --> 02:06:28.615
So you freely admit that
you helped rig these shows?

02:06:28.706 --> 02:06:31.322
- What else could we do?
- Congratulations.

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:33.499
- For what?
- Van Doren.

02:06:34.045 --> 02:06:37.503
I thought we were gonna get television.

02:06:38.174 --> 02:06:42.008
The truth is television is gonna get us.

02:06:44.013 --> 02:06:47.847
And you obviously
don't think you did anything wrong.

02:06:47.975 --> 02:06:51.888
Yes, we did one thing
wrong. We were too successful.

02:06:52.021 --> 02:06:54.012
<i>You were too successful.</i>

02:06:54.023 --> 02:06:57.390
<i>Those advertising dollars</i>
<i>came from somewhere.</i>

02:06:57.527 --> 02:06:59.392
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>the newspapers and magazines</i>

02:06:59.403 --> 02:07:01.064
<i>are making such a big thing about this?</i>

02:07:01.739 --> 02:07:03.695
<i>Mr. Enright,</i>

02:07:03.699 --> 02:07:06.532
<i>you make it sound like</i>
<i>you are the victim here.</i>

02:07:06.619 --> 02:07:09.201
<i>The sponsor makes out,</i>
<i>the network makes out,</i>

02:07:09.539 --> 02:07:13.031
<i>the contestants see money</i>
<i>they would never see in a lifetime</i>

02:07:13.042 --> 02:07:14.407
<i>and the public is entertained.</i>

02:07:14.544 --> 02:07:16.409
<i>So who gets hurt?</i>

02:07:24.679 --> 02:07:26.465
<i>Mr. Freedman,</i>

02:07:26.556 --> 02:07:30.925
<i>you freely admit that</i>
<i>you helped rig these shows?</i>

02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:34.678
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>- "Yes, sir"? That's it?</i>

02:07:35.898 --> 02:07:38.605
<i>Well, sir,</i>
<i>I don't know what else to say.</i>

02:07:38.734 --> 02:07:42.898
<i>Give the public what they want.</i>
<i>It's like your business.</i>

02:07:43.072 --> 02:07:48.112
<i>Do you see a need</i>
<i>for government regulation in this area?</i>

02:07:48.244 --> 02:07:51.532
<i>You know, it's not like</i>
<i>the quiz shows are a public utility, sir.</i>

02:07:51.622 --> 02:07:53.783
<i>It's entertainment.</i>

02:07:53.916 --> 02:07:56.328
<i>We're not exactly</i>
<i>hardened criminals here.</i>

02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:59.452
<i>We're in show business.</i>

02:08:43.633 --> 02:08:46.670
<i>See the shark with</i>

02:08:47.136 --> 02:08:50.469
<i>Teeth like razors</i>

02:08:50.973 --> 02:08:53.840
<i>You can read his</i>

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:57.267
<i>Open face</i>

02:08:58.189 --> 02:09:00.305
<i>And Macheath</i>

02:09:00.316 --> 02:09:04.650
<i>He's got a knife, but</i>

02:09:05.738 --> 02:09:07.820
<i>Not in such</i>

02:09:07.823 --> 02:09:12.192
<i>An obvious place</i>

02:09:13.037 --> 02:09:15.403
<i>On a beautiful</i>

02:09:17.041 --> 02:09:19.327
<i>Blue Sunday</i>

02:09:20.211 --> 02:09:22.327
<i>See the corpse</i>

02:09:23.005 --> 02:09:26.338
<i>Stretched in the Strand</i>

02:09:27.343 --> 02:09:31.256
<i>See a man dodge</i>

02:09:31.347 --> 02:09:33.679
<i>Round the corner</i>

02:09:34.725 --> 02:09:37.341
<i>Mackie's friends will</i>

02:09:38.354 --> 02:09:41.061
<i>Understand</i>

02:09:42.316 --> 02:09:43.522
<i>Mr. Meier</i>

02:09:45.444 --> 02:09:47.856
<i>Reported missing</i>

02:09:49.115 --> 02:09:51.356
<i>Like so many</i>

02:09:52.493 --> 02:09:55.030
<i>Wealthy men</i>

02:09:56.247 --> 02:09:57.908
<i>Mack the Knife</i>

02:09:57.999 --> 02:10:02.368
<i>Acquired his cash box</i>

02:10:03.337 --> 02:10:06.750
<i>God alone knows</i>

02:10:06.841 --> 02:10:09.924
<i>How or when</i>

02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:12.802
<i>Jenny Towler</i>

02:10:13.264 --> 02:10:16.347
<i>She turned up lately</i>

02:10:17.351 --> 02:10:19.842
<i>With a knife stuck</i>

02:10:20.604 --> 02:10:23.266
<i>Through her breast</i>
