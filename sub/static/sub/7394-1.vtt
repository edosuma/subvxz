56:16.792 --> 56:19.834
THOUGHT HE COULD SAVE
MY FATHER'S COMPANY.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.750
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

56:22.750 --> 56:24.959
I EVEN THOUGHT I LOVED HIM.

56:26.208 --> 56:27.792
GONNA DO A SHIELD RESCUE
FOR THE GUY ON THE GROUND?

56:27.792 --> 56:29.375

WHERE THE SHOOTER IS.

ISN'T GOING TO MAKE
THE GUNS DISAPPEAR.

BRING YOUR DAUGHTER BACK.

56:53.834 --> 56:56.041
TO ONE MAN STANDING
IN FRONT OF A TANK

56:56.041 --> 56:58.375
THAT COULDN'T
MOVE OR SHOOT,

56:58.375 --> 56:59.917
BECAUSE HUMAN DIGNITY

56:59.917 --> 57:01.875
WAS STRONGER THAN
STEEL OR BULLETS.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.083
HE CHANGED A NATION.

57:03.083 --> 57:05.542
THAT WAS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SITUATION.

57:05.542 --> 57:06.166
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

57:06.166 --> 57:08.000
WE GOT GATED
COMMUNITIES,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000

57:10.000 --> 57:11.792
AND KIDS CARRYING
COMBAT WEAPONS,

57:11.792 --> 57:13.500
ALL BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE

57:13.500 --> 57:15.458
HAVEN'T EVEN READ
THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

57:15.458 --> 57:19.166
SO, OUR FREEDOM OF
SPEECH IS PROTECTED

57:19.166 --> 57:21.625
AS LONG AS
WE DON'T PISS OFF
A GUY WITH A GUN.

57:21.625 --> 57:24.333
I'M NOT BRAVE ENOUGH
TO TAKE A BULLET FOR MY COUNTRY.

57:24.333 --> 57:25.959
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
YOURSELF.

57:27.583 --> 57:28.458
THAT GUARANTEES
OUR FREEDOM

57:28.458 --> 57:33.166

IS RESPONSIBILITY.

57:33.166 --> 57:34.917
WE LOST THAT
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

BLOW JOBS.

57:38.291 --> 57:41.208
MANY OF THE FATHERS OF
THE CONSTITUTION HAD SLAVES,

57:41.208 --> 57:43.458

FIGURED OUT THAT

57:58.125 --> 57:59.709
THERE IS
NO SUCH THING

57:59.709 --> 58:02.625
AS A POLITICALLY
CORRECT GUN.

58:02.625 --> 58:04.500
I'LL SAY ALL THAT
TO THE PRESS.

THAT DEAL, TOO?

58:56.000 --> 58:57.625
IT WAS MORE
OF A DONATION.

58:57.625 --> 58:59.834

THE CASH FLOW,

GOES A LONG WAY.

IT WAS ONE OF THOSE

59:15.959 --> 59:18.542

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:24.625
Woman, on stage:
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:25.917
IT'S UP TO YOU.

01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:28.375
DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?

01:00:29.291 --> 01:00:30.208
OF COURSE I DO.

01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:33.208
HOW ABOUT YOU?

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:36.166
OF COURSE.

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:39.125
IT WON'T MAKE
A BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

01:00:40.667 --> 01:00:42.959
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:46.750
HOW FULL IS THE THEATER?

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.583
Usher:
IT'S THE LAST PERFORMANCE.

01:00:59.542 --> 01:01:02.166
I FIGURE 10
TO CLEAR THE BUILDING.

01:01:02.166 --> 01:01:04.458
Mac: COPY THAT.
NO ONE EXITS THE FRONT DOOR.

01:01:04.458 --> 01:01:06.375
HOLD UNTIL WE'VE CLEARED
ALL REAR EXITS.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:23.000
SENATOR TOLLMAN'S SON
WAS JUST SHOT

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.792
BY THE SAME GUY
WHO'S GOT LIBERTY.

01:01:29.834 --> 01:01:31.875
CALL UP YOUR HUSBAND.

01:01:31.875 --> 01:01:33.458
WHY?

01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:35.000
[CELL PHONE RINGING]

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.875
[RING]

01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:43.041
YEAH?

01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:44.417
Joe: WHO CALLED THE MILITIA?

01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:47.583
I WANT TO TALK
TO LIBERTY.

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.166
TOUCHING.

01:01:49.166 --> 01:01:51.166
SO IT'S NOT
ONE OF YOURS?

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.875
THAT'S NOT GOOD, VICTOR.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.083
LIBERTY, ARE YOU THERE?

01:01:54.083 --> 01:01:56.834
SUCH A SWEET NAME,
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:01:56.834 --> 01:01:58.583
HER PARENTS
WERE REPUBLICAN.

01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:01.000
I WANT TO TALK
TO MY WIFE.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.041
Liberty: I'M HERE. ALIVE...

01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:06.208
AND ON TV.

01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:07.875
I, UM...

01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:11.792
I KNOW, YOU'RE DOING
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

01:02:15.792 --> 01:02:17.792
DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S CALLING THE SHOTS?

01:02:17.792 --> 01:02:19.667
THE PRESIDENT'S WIFE?

01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:22.458
COME ON.

01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:25.041
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:27.041
IF IT WERE HER,
YOU'D BE STANDING HERE.

01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:31.709
UM...

01:02:31.709 --> 01:02:34.750
I'M--I'M DOING
WHAT I CAN, BUT...

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.417
YOU KNOW THE RULES.
RIGHT?

01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:40.375
AW, HONEY...

01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:41.417
FUCK YOU.

01:02:41.417 --> 01:02:45.041
JOE, HANG UP.

01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:46.208
WELL, WHAT SHE MEANT IS,

01:02:46.208 --> 01:02:49.083
WHY DON'T YOU LET HER
DIE WITH SOME DIGNITY?

01:02:57.417 --> 01:03:00.750
GET THE CAR.
MR. WALLACE IS LEAVING.

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:02.250
Driver: YES, SIR.

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:16.000
HOW DO YOU KNOW VICTOR?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.917
CLASSIFIED.

01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:22.083
Policeman: THIS WAY.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:23.041
COPY THAT.

01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:23.959
WHO THE FUCK IS SHE?

01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:26.125
WE JUST I.D.ed HER.
LIBERTY WALLACE.

01:03:26.125 --> 01:03:28.500
THE VP OF McCLOUD.
MARRIED TO THE CEO.

UP THE WAZOO.

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:32.083
JESUS CHRIST.
I KNOW HIM. VICTOR.

01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:34.834
YEAH, WE'RE TRYING
TO TRACK HIM DOWN
RIGHT NOW.

01:03:34.834 --> 01:03:36.709
THEN THERE'S NO WAY
SHE'S WITH THE SHOOTER.

01:03:36.709 --> 01:03:37.125
SHE'S A HOSTAGE.

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:41.834
SO I'M BAIT?

01:03:41.834 --> 01:03:44.458
NO. MORE LIKE...

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:48.542
MORE LIKE A SHOWPIECE.

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:52.709
I LIKE YOUR
RECKLESS SIDE.

01:03:52.709 --> 01:03:55.625
YOU TRAVELED WITHOUT
YOUR BODYGUARD

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:58.417
5 HOURS EVERY WEEK
AND SOMETIMES TWICE.

01:03:58.417 --> 01:04:00.667
YOU WERE A LITTLE BIT
MORE ACCESSIBLE

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:02.667
AND PREDICTABLE THAN
THE PRESIDENT'S WIFE.

01:04:02.667 --> 01:04:05.500
SO WHO'S PISSED OFF
AT VICTOR?

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:05.959
THE PRESIDENT?

01:04:08.834 --> 01:04:10.125
[SIGHS]

01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:15.875
NO.

01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:22.083
IT'S ALL ME
THIS TIME.

01:04:24.333 --> 01:04:27.166
I WAS A DAD.

01:04:27.166 --> 01:04:30.709
I'M NOT ANYMORE.

01:04:32.959 --> 01:04:34.083
SOMEBODY'S PULLING
YOUR STRING. WHO IS IT?

01:04:36.834 --> 01:04:38.333
NO ONE.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:41.000
NOT NOW.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.208
NEVER THOUGHT MY SKILLS
FROM MY FORMER LIFE
WOULD EVER PAY OFF.

01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:47.208
CIA?

01:04:51.375 --> 01:04:53.834
[LAUGHS] WELL...

01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:57.542
THAT, TOO.

01:04:57.542 --> 01:04:58.625
WELL, COME ON,
IF I'M GOING TO DIE,

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:01.875
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW
MY ASSASSIN A LITTLE BETTER.

01:05:03.542 --> 01:05:05.500
I WORKED COVERT.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.542
COVERT OPERATIONS
FOR THE CIA.

01:05:08.542 --> 01:05:10.417
I WAS IN CHINA DURING
TIANANMEN SQUARE.

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:13.750
CUBA, PANAMA.

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:15.834
AND I WAS
IN COLUMBIA...

01:05:15.834 --> 01:05:18.041
WHEN MY DAUGHTER
WAS KILLED.

01:05:41.709 --> 01:05:44.458
THIS IS CAPTAIN HANK WILFORD.

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:47.166
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:50.917
I DON'T WANT
ANYONE ELSE TO DIE

01:05:50.917 --> 01:05:52.417
BECAUSE THEY'RE
TALKING TO ME, JOE.

01:05:52.417 --> 01:05:54.166
SO WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE?

01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:55.083
MM-MM-MM.

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:56.667
IT'S YOUR SHOW, BABY.

01:05:56.667 --> 01:05:59.583
JUST LEAVE ME
OUT OF THIS FOR NOW.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:05.625
Liberty: THERE'S A BOMB
IN THE HOT DOG CART!

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:08.959
IT'S SET TO BLOW WHEN
MY CELL PHONE DIES!

01:06:08.959 --> 01:06:11.458
IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

01:06:11.458 --> 01:06:14.458
I'M CHAINED TO THE CART!

01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:17.959
WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS?

01:06:17.959 --> 01:06:22.792
A PUBLIC DEBATE
OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT!

01:06:22.792 --> 01:06:23.750
HMM.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:25.291
HEARD OF IT?

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:26.709
GO, GIRL.
[LAUGHS]

01:06:26.709 --> 01:06:28.750
I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:29.709
ARE THERE ANY OTHER DEMANDS?

01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:32.166
CAN I COME CLOSER?

01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:34.917
ANY OTHER DEMANDS?

01:06:34.917 --> 01:06:36.000
NO.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.083
NO!

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.750
LIBERTY,

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:50.667
I WILL KILL
ANYONE WHO COMES CLOSE.

01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:52.291
WE HAVE NO CONFIRMATION YET,
BUT IT APPEARS

01:06:52.291 --> 01:06:56.166
THAT KNBS REPORTER
BILL TOLLMAN HAS BEEN
SERIOUSLY HURT

01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:59.125
AND THAT LIBERTY WALLACE
OF McCLOUD GUNS

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.834
IS DEMANDING
A PUBLIC DEBATE

01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:02.125
ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION

01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:05.041
AND ITS ROLE
IN OUR VIOLENT TIMES.

01:07:05.917 --> 01:07:06.500
SHE'S GRANDSTANDING.
GOTTA BE MILITIA.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.875
SIR.

01:07:08.875 --> 01:07:09.959
YEAH? YES, SIR.

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:12.417
YES, SIR.
LIBERTY WALLACE.

01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:14.333
YOU WERE GOOD
UNDER THE PRESSURE,

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:16.667
AND THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL APPLAUD YOU.

01:07:16.667 --> 01:07:18.667
OR LAUGH AT ME.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.917
THE PRESS IS
THE LEAST OF MY CONCERNS
AT THIS POINT.

01:07:20.917 --> 01:07:22.125
I'LL TRY TO MOVE
THEM BACK, BUT, UH...

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:25.667
YES, SIR. I'LL MOVE
THEM BACK RIGHT AWAY.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:27.834
THANK YOU, SIR.

01:07:27.834 --> 01:07:29.542
GET RID OF THE PRESS.
TELL THEM IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE.

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:31.375
UPTOWN DOESN'T WANT
THIS THING UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

01:07:31.375 --> 01:07:33.000
THEY'RE GOING
TO MAKE A MOVE, JOE.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.792
THEY'LL NEVER
DISARM THAT BOMB.

01:07:34.792 --> 01:07:37.166
THEY'VE PROBABLY
ALREADY GUESSED THAT.

01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:40.125
YOU WON'T BE ALONE
IN THE FINAL MOMENT.

Mac: SOMEBODY WELDED
ALL THE SIDE EXITS SHUT.

01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:47.041
WE'VE GOT
AN ENTRY TEAM COMING IN,

01:07:47.041 --> 01:07:47.834
BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT--

01:07:47.834 --> 01:07:50.041
IS STUCK IN TRAFFIC.

01:07:50.041 --> 01:07:51.333
ALL EXITS?

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.542
YEAH. OUR CUTTERS
WON'T WORK.

01:07:52.542 --> 01:07:53.583
THE ONLY EXIT
IS ON TO THE STREET

01:07:53.583 --> 01:07:56.041
THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR.

01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:57.291
200 FUCKING HOSTAGES.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:09.333
TELL ME ABOUT
YOU DAUGHTER AGAIN.

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:22.207
A BOY AT SCHOOL
PUT A GUN TO HER HEAD

01:08:22.207 --> 01:08:26.834
AND ASKED HER
IF SHE BELIEVED IN GOD.

01:08:26.834 --> 01:08:27.750
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:30.207
I DON'T KNOW.

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:31.709

What did she say?

I don't know.

THE BOMB TRUCK?

01:08:45.207 --> 01:08:46.834
WE GOT ONE
COMING IN FROM THE 48.

01:08:46.834 --> 01:08:47.750
ETA 30 MINUTES.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.709
GENERAL EVACUATION?

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:50.959
WE GOT
A PHONE TREE GOING.

01:08:50.959 --> 01:08:52.417
WE'RE GOING TO FIND
THIS SON OF A BITCH.

01:08:52.417 --> 01:08:53.082
IT'S JUST GOING
TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME.

01:08:53.082 --> 01:08:55.625
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:04.166
MY FATHER.

01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:13.082
HE WAS MY HERO.

01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:18.250
HE WAS.

01:09:25.166 --> 01:09:27.207
AFTER HE, UM...

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:29.792
YOU KNOW...

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:36.500
I HAD TO LEAVE SCHOOL
TO EARN A LIVING,

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.417
AND ONE THING
LED TO THE NEXT.

IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS...

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.959
NO LONGER FAMILY OWNED.

01:09:44.959 --> 01:09:46.625
CAPTAIN,
I ONLY GOT 10 GUYS.

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:48.332
WE SHOULD BE FINE ONCE
THE 53rd SQUAD SHOW UP.

01:09:48.332 --> 01:09:51.082
THAT SHOULD BE ANOTHER,
UH, 10 OR 12 MINUTES.

01:09:51.082 --> 01:09:52.875
WE'RE NOT
GOING TO MAKE IT.

01:09:52.875 --> 01:09:54.082
Liberty: IT'S ALL I KNEW.

01:09:54.082 --> 01:09:56.000
ALONG CAME VICTOR.
HE WAS BRILLIANT,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.375
BUT HE COULD SAVE
MY FATHERS'S COMPANY.

01:09:57.375 --> 01:09:59.417
OUR FIRST BIG DEAL
WAS WITH THE SAUDIS.

01:09:59.417 --> 01:10:01.959
THE IRAQIS WERE SHOOTING US
WITH OUR OWN GUNS.

01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:04.834
WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK
THE GOVERNMENT DOES
WITH ALL THOSE USED WEAPONS?

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:07.917
MELT THEM DOWN,
MAKE LITTLE SCULPTURES
OUT OF THEM?

01:10:07.917 --> 01:10:09.083
AFTER WE TOOK
THE COMPANY INTERNATIONAL,

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:09.834
SUDDENLY WE WERE
IN A DIFFERENT LEAGUE.

01:10:09.834 --> 01:10:13.250
IT GOT COMPLICATED.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:16.000
HERE I AM.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.208
AND RUSSELL MADE YOU
FEEL HUMAN AGAIN.

01:10:19.208 --> 01:10:22.542
AND ANONYMOUS.

01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:27.041
YOU KNOW, MY GREAT,
GREAT GRANDFATHER...

01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:29.041
HE DESIGNED THE GUN
THAT CHANGED THE OUTCOME

01:10:29.041 --> 01:10:33.375
OF THE CIVIL WAR.
[LAUGHS]

01:10:33.375 --> 01:10:35.834
I GREW UP THINKING
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE
STILL DOING.

01:10:35.834 --> 01:10:38.875
[PANICKED SHOUTING]

01:10:38.875 --> 01:10:40.875

WE HAVE TO CLEAR
THE BUILDING.

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:42.917
STAND BACK...

01:10:42.917 --> 01:10:45.834
LET ME OUT OF HERE,
