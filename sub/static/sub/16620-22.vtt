00:19.789 --> 00:21.171
Wow, that does sound pretty amazing.

00:21.196 --> 00:22.440
I'll... I'll be sure to look it up.

00:22.492 --> 00:24.132
Anyway, I just double-checked
the walk-in,

00:24.161 --> 00:25.461
and five boxes should work.

00:25.495 --> 00:26.962
Thanks, Demitri. Talk to you...

00:26.997 --> 00:29.131
- Oh. He, he's gone.
- What happened, Dad?

00:29.166 --> 00:30.877
Did the meat guy just
hang up on you in a huff?

00:30.901 --> 00:32.268
No, my phone died.

00:32.302 --> 00:33.813
The battery only lasts about ten minutes

00:33.837 --> 00:35.237
before I have to charge it again.

00:35.272 --> 00:36.906
You really need to get a new phone, Bob.

00:36.940 --> 00:39.208
- That one's older than Gene.
- And hairier.

00:39.242 --> 00:41.043
My phone wouldn't have died if Demitri

00:41.077 --> 00:42.588
hadn't spent so much time
talking about a big sale

00:42.612 --> 00:44.213
at Outdoor Adventure World.

00:44.247 --> 00:46.382
He said they're closing
the location in Bog Harbor

00:46.416 --> 00:47.950
and everything is marked down.

00:47.984 --> 00:49.485
I guess today is the last day.

00:49.519 --> 00:51.587
You guys have great conversations.

00:51.621 --> 00:53.299
It actually sounds
like a pretty good sale.

00:53.323 --> 00:54.967
- I'm gonna look it up.
- On your ancient

00:54.991 --> 00:56.492
16-pound laptop.

00:56.526 --> 00:57.593
I don't know.

00:57.627 --> 00:58.961
Remember that camping pizza oven

00:58.995 --> 01:00.429
that you swore we needed?

01:00.463 --> 01:01.497
We never used it once.

01:01.531 --> 01:03.065
I set it up. I think.

01:03.099 --> 01:04.766
I used it to dry one of my swimsuits.

01:04.801 --> 01:06.001
Perfect crust.

01:06.036 --> 01:07.937
Wow. These discounts are incredible.

01:07.971 --> 01:11.140
75% off? I could get
some kayaking stuff.

01:11.174 --> 01:13.175
Kayaking. You. Really?

01:13.210 --> 01:15.444
I could be a kayak guy. Maybe.

01:15.478 --> 01:17.523
Right, 'cause the only thing
holding you back all these years

01:17.547 --> 01:19.181
was the insane cost of paddles.

01:19.216 --> 01:20.649
Okay, maybe not a kayak guy,

01:20.684 --> 01:22.618
but what about a climbing guy?

01:22.652 --> 01:24.587
Let's talk about the word "guy."

01:24.621 --> 01:26.155
All right, we get it.

01:26.189 --> 01:28.357
There's a tough outdoor
Bob hiding inside

01:28.391 --> 01:30.860
- that squeezable indoor body.
- Thanks.

01:30.894 --> 01:32.538
You know what, if you really
want to go to that sale,

01:32.562 --> 01:33.802
- why don't you go now?
- Really?

01:33.830 --> 01:35.764
Sure. I mean, it's the last day.

01:35.799 --> 01:37.443
The kids and I will
finish up the dinner rush

01:37.467 --> 01:39.101
and close up before Gayle comes over.

01:39.135 --> 01:40.769
Wait, Gayle's coming over?

01:40.804 --> 01:42.438
Yeah, she wrote a one-woman show.

01:42.472 --> 01:44.540
She needs to do a run-through
before she debuts it.

01:44.574 --> 01:45.826
- She wants feedback.
- What?

01:45.851 --> 01:46.642
- Uh...
- Mmm...

01:46.676 --> 01:49.154
- Be nice.
- Okay, then, I'm definitely gonna go.

01:49.179 --> 01:50.813
We can go to the store with you, Dad.

01:50.847 --> 01:52.391
- Yeah, this... that sale sounds great.
- I want to go with you, Dad.

01:52.415 --> 01:53.716
No way, Josés.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.351
I need you kids here in the restaurant.

01:55.385 --> 01:56.385
See you guys later.

01:56.419 --> 01:57.720
Say hi to Aunt Gayle for me.

01:57.754 --> 01:58.954
You walk out that door,

01:58.989 --> 02:01.023
we're through, mister. You hear me?

02:01.057 --> 02:02.858
♪

02:03.338 --> 02:04.671
Whoa.

02:05.441 --> 02:07.363
Hello, outdoor stuff.

02:07.397 --> 02:08.808
Welcome to Outdoor Adventure World.

02:08.832 --> 02:10.566
- I'm Austin.
- Uh, hi.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.501
Big sale. Huge sale!

02:12.535 --> 02:14.737
Sad we're closing, but
happy you're getting a deal.

02:14.771 --> 02:16.205
Uh, yeah, great.

02:16.239 --> 02:17.907
Now let's get you in some gear.

02:17.941 --> 02:19.151
What are you in the market for?

02:19.175 --> 02:20.643
I've demoed everything in the store.

02:20.677 --> 02:22.745
Uh, kind of just browsing.

02:22.779 --> 02:25.168
This sleeping bag is
insanely comfortable.

02:25.193 --> 02:27.216
- Oh.
- In fact, I'm taking this one with me

02:27.250 --> 02:29.151
on the Appalachian Trail next week.

02:29.185 --> 02:30.753
That sounds... um...

02:30.787 --> 02:32.888
I'm gonna go... over here.

02:32.923 --> 02:35.557
You looking for a split-grain
leather or a full-grain leather?

02:35.592 --> 02:37.726
I'm not really looking
for any kind of leather.

02:37.761 --> 02:38.727
I'm just still browsing.

02:38.762 --> 02:39.728
Well, if you change your mind,

02:39.763 --> 02:41.196
just leather me know.

02:41.231 --> 02:42.564
Scuba? Spear fishing?

02:42.599 --> 02:43.866
Oh, my God.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.177
You do mountain bikes? Road bikes?

02:45.201 --> 02:46.702
- Racing?
- Oh, look, there's a tent.

02:46.736 --> 02:47.870
Ah, good eye.

02:47.904 --> 02:49.271
That's a four-season tent.

02:49.306 --> 02:50.673
It's basically a house.

02:50.707 --> 02:51.918
You put a mailbox on the front of that,

02:51.942 --> 02:53.075
you can call it a day.

02:53.109 --> 02:54.610
Uh, I'm gonna check out the inside.

02:54.644 --> 02:56.045
I'll... I'll see you later, maybe.

02:56.079 --> 02:58.347
All right. Take a
look at that vestibule.

02:58.381 --> 03:00.115
I can't really hear
you, I'm inside a tent.

03:00.150 --> 03:02.184
Oh, and the vents... Look at this mesh.

03:02.218 --> 03:03.352
Ooh, I'm gonna zip this up.

03:03.386 --> 03:04.896
Yeah, yeah, yeah, zip it up.

03:05.162 --> 03:06.922
Who's ready for the world premiere

03:06.957 --> 03:08.624
of my one-woman show?

03:08.658 --> 03:10.292
Gayle, hi.

03:10.327 --> 03:11.860
Aw, we could hardly wait.

03:11.895 --> 03:13.963
Kids, tell your Aunt
Gayle how excited you are.

03:13.997 --> 03:16.532
What is this, like one of those
one-act, five-minute things?

03:16.566 --> 03:18.534
Sometimes even three
minutes can be a thrill.

03:18.568 --> 03:20.302
Well, I, for one, loved it.

03:20.337 --> 03:21.714
Should we head over to the wrap party?

03:21.738 --> 03:23.939
Kids, come on. What's it called?

03:23.974 --> 03:26.275
It's called "My Boobs Are Down Here:

03:26.309 --> 03:29.211
Laughing and Aging and
Raging and Laughing."

03:29.245 --> 03:31.146
I love it. Oh, and it's so great

03:31.181 --> 03:32.881
they're letting you
perform at the library.

03:32.916 --> 03:34.450
Yeah, I'm doing it in the hallway,

03:34.484 --> 03:35.995
where the water fountains
and the bathrooms are.

03:36.019 --> 03:38.087
It's part of a series
called "Art in the Hallway:

03:38.121 --> 03:39.899
Where the Water Fountains
and the Bathrooms Are."

03:39.923 --> 03:41.724
Okay, I think we're all closed up here.

03:41.758 --> 03:42.835
Why don't we head upstairs?

03:42.859 --> 03:44.226
Just one quick thing:

03:44.260 --> 03:46.895
the play gets a little messy.

03:46.930 --> 03:48.397
Messy? Wait, what do you mean?

03:48.431 --> 03:50.666
Oh, you know, at one
point I spill some milk

03:50.700 --> 03:51.967
and slip in it.

03:52.002 --> 03:53.969
- Okay.
- In another part,

03:54.004 --> 03:56.741
I violently stab a few
pillows and rip 'em open.

03:56.766 --> 03:57.991
- Oh.
- Go on.

03:58.016 --> 04:00.142
Also, there's about
a dozen spit takes.

04:00.176 --> 04:01.944
- Perfect amount.
- Hey, you know what?

04:01.978 --> 04:03.512
Why don't we do it in the basement?

04:03.546 --> 04:05.080
It'll be like our own little theater.

04:05.115 --> 04:07.082
Down there, you can be as
messy as you want to be.

04:07.117 --> 04:09.184
Great. That way, no
one will hear me scream.

04:09.219 --> 04:11.187
This is gonna be the
most age-inappropriate

04:11.212 --> 04:12.617
thing we've ever seen.

04:12.642 --> 04:14.857
it's a dead cow on a bun

04:14.891 --> 04:17.026
but it's still really
fun. Also, we're closed.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.627
- Gene, it's me.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

04:18.661 --> 04:20.272
Have you been answering
the phone like that?

04:20.296 --> 04:21.797
Yep. People love it.

04:21.831 --> 04:23.943
Well, tell your mom
that I might be a little late.

04:23.967 --> 04:25.701
It's a really great sale, but...

04:25.735 --> 04:27.503
I'm kind of avoiding an employee.

04:27.537 --> 04:29.338
Oh, sure. That makes total sense.

04:29.372 --> 04:30.839
You're not having an affair at all.

04:30.874 --> 04:32.775
Who is it? Is it your secretary?

04:32.809 --> 04:35.511
Gene. Gene? Oh, crap.

04:35.545 --> 04:36.992
Stupid phone.

04:37.514 --> 04:39.281
Hmm, this is pretty great.

04:39.315 --> 04:41.550
Maybe I'll get this tent.
Ooh, kind of expensive.

04:41.584 --> 04:44.353
That's not much of a
discount. Maybe not this tent.

04:44.387 --> 04:46.555
But one a lot like it.

04:46.589 --> 04:48.390
One that maybe smells like it.

04:48.425 --> 04:51.126
Or maybe a kayak that smells like it.

04:53.596 --> 04:54.496
Whoa.

04:54.531 --> 04:56.331
Whoo-hoo!

04:57.567 --> 05:00.469
Ah.

05:00.503 --> 05:02.237
Oh. That's weird.

05:02.272 --> 05:03.672
It's quiet and dark in here.

05:03.706 --> 05:06.308
Oh, my God. It's quiet and dark in here!

05:06.342 --> 05:07.576
Crap, crap, crap, crap!

05:07.610 --> 05:10.179
Oh... I can't... can't get out!

05:10.213 --> 05:13.482
Can't... can't get out!

05:13.516 --> 05:15.918
Damn it! Oh!

05:15.952 --> 05:18.253
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:18.288 --> 05:20.810
Oh, no, they locked me in!

05:20.917 --> 05:23.990
And I slept through the sale! Noooo!

05:25.464 --> 05:27.032
_

05:27.061 --> 05:29.296
All right. Stuck inside
Outdoor Adventure World.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.865
It's okay, I'll just
try the emergency exits.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.100
Crap.

05:33.134 --> 05:34.468
Crap.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.769
Crap!

05:35.803 --> 05:37.604
Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap!

05:37.639 --> 05:40.274
All right, I can...
I can just call for help.

05:40.308 --> 05:42.231
Oh, no, I can't. Phone's dead.

05:42.256 --> 05:44.185
Okay, uh, landline.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.280
Damn it.

05:46.438 --> 05:48.372
Aah! That's bright.

05:50.029 --> 05:52.017
Wait. Is that a motion sensor?

05:52.042 --> 05:53.576
Hey! Is there anyone there?

05:53.608 --> 05:55.943
I'm in here! I'm stuck in here!

05:55.977 --> 05:58.078
Come on!

05:58.112 --> 06:01.582
Linda and the kids
are probably worried sick.

06:01.616 --> 06:04.926
Your dad's probably upstairs
wondering where the heck we are.

06:04.951 --> 06:06.595
I'll go tell him. I can go.

06:06.619 --> 06:07.506
- I'll go.
- No, no, I'll just text him.

06:07.531 --> 06:08.654
It's all right, it's fine.

06:08.678 --> 06:10.156
Write on the phone what
you want to say to him

06:10.180 --> 06:11.740
- and I'll run it up to him.
- Shh!

06:11.765 --> 06:14.300
Chapter two: birth.

06:14.365 --> 06:18.001
My first studio apartment
was a cozy uterus.

06:18.035 --> 06:21.071
But, boy, was it small,
and the plumbing was a mess.

06:21.105 --> 06:24.107
But when I started to put
up a fight, I was evicted.

06:27.044 --> 06:31.114
The hospital carelessly,
casually threw away my placenta,

06:31.149 --> 06:34.284
and in some ways, I've never recovered.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.445
Ugh, it's wet. Why is it wet?

06:36.487 --> 06:37.954
Oh, God, get it off, get it off.

06:37.989 --> 06:40.724
Chapter three: day one of my life.

06:40.758 --> 06:42.392
Where it all went wrong...

06:42.426 --> 06:44.027
and then right and then wrong.

06:44.061 --> 06:46.263
Okay, tried that door already.

06:46.297 --> 06:48.732
That door's locked. That's the bathroom.

06:48.766 --> 06:50.133
That's where I went to the bathroom

06:50.168 --> 06:51.735
when I didn't know there was a bathroom.

06:51.769 --> 06:52.913
Glad no one was here for that.

06:52.937 --> 06:53.937
Hi.

06:53.971 --> 06:56.706
- It's Austin!
- Huh... I, I, I,

06:56.741 --> 06:58.809
I remember. I didn't get your name.

06:58.843 --> 07:00.877
- Uh, Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

07:00.912 --> 07:02.312
Wh... What are you doing here?

07:02.346 --> 07:04.714
Well, my big Appalachian
trip starts next week

07:04.749 --> 07:06.627
and I didn't feel like
paying a whole month's rent.

07:06.651 --> 07:07.951
What are you doing here?

07:07.985 --> 07:09.920
I, uh, fell asleep in that tent.

07:09.954 --> 07:11.788
Ha! Nice, man.

07:11.823 --> 07:14.257
Wait, where have you
been this whole time?

07:14.292 --> 07:15.469
Oh, I've been hanging
out in the back office

07:15.493 --> 07:16.993
listening to my audiobook.

07:17.028 --> 07:19.496
Don't Wipe with That:
Hiking the Appalachian Trail.

07:19.530 --> 07:22.065
It doesn't actually work that
well as an audiobook, though.

07:22.099 --> 07:24.011
I feel like the illustrations
are probably important.

07:24.035 --> 07:25.445
Okay, yeah. Um, can you please show me

07:25.469 --> 07:27.003
how to get out of here?

07:27.038 --> 07:30.340
Hmm... I don't really
know if there is a way out.

07:30.374 --> 07:32.108
They locked and chained all the doors.

07:32.143 --> 07:34.144
Well, how were you
planning on getting out?

07:34.178 --> 07:36.123
Oh, I was just gonna wait
until the moving crew comes

07:36.147 --> 07:37.747
to get the rest of
the merch in six days.

07:37.782 --> 07:39.583
No one's coming here for six days?

07:39.617 --> 07:41.484
No, today's the last day of the sale.

07:41.519 --> 07:42.919
Store's closed forever.

07:42.954 --> 07:44.154
Oh, my God.

07:44.188 --> 07:45.299
Wh... What about the alarm system?

07:45.323 --> 07:46.857
Why isn't that working?

07:46.891 --> 07:49.960
Ah, I turned that off so
no one would know I'm here.

07:49.994 --> 07:51.605
Well, if you turned
it off, does that mean

07:51.629 --> 07:53.941
you can turn it back on and
then I could use it to get out?

07:53.965 --> 07:56.132
Okay, yeah, if you don't tell the guards

07:56.167 --> 07:57.311
that I'm here when they come for you.

07:57.335 --> 07:58.869
Um, sure.

08:00.905 --> 08:02.592
All right, give 'em a wave, Bob.

08:03.574 --> 08:05.375
Yes!

08:05.409 --> 08:07.544
It's working! The alarm is working!

08:07.578 --> 08:09.613
Look how excited you get.

08:09.647 --> 08:10.724
All right, I'm gonna go hide.

08:10.748 --> 08:12.115
Don't tell 'em I'm here.

08:12.149 --> 08:14.284
Actually, yeah, no,
tell 'em I'm not here.

08:14.318 --> 08:17.854
You want me to explicitly
tell them that you're not here?

08:17.889 --> 08:19.122
Yes. No.

08:19.156 --> 08:20.824
Uh, but tell them that I said hi.

08:20.858 --> 08:22.659
No, wait, that doesn't... Never mind!

08:25.329 --> 08:26.997
This place is locked
up, but I didn't see

08:27.031 --> 08:29.132
- any signs of a break-in. You?
- Nope.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.001
False alarm. Shut it down.

08:31.035 --> 08:32.469
Eh. This isn't so hard.

08:32.503 --> 08:34.371
Why'd they say this job was hard?

08:34.405 --> 08:36.640
It... stopped. Nobody's coming in.

08:36.674 --> 08:39.075
I'm gonna set it off again.

08:39.110 --> 08:40.477
It's not working.

08:40.510 --> 08:42.345
Oh, sometimes if they get a false alarm

08:42.380 --> 08:43.513
they just shut it off.

08:43.547 --> 08:44.848
But this isn't a false alarm,

08:44.882 --> 08:46.249
this is a real alarm.

08:46.284 --> 08:48.551
Well, I know that. They don't know that.

08:48.586 --> 08:50.553
W... Will you please just
put the code in again?

08:52.356 --> 08:54.391
- Yep, this thing's shut off.
- Oh, great.

08:54.425 --> 08:56.660
Yeah, they're not the
best security company.

08:56.694 --> 08:59.763
It was my second sophomore
year in junior college,

08:59.797 --> 09:01.865
and I took a trip to New York City

09:01.899 --> 09:05.368
with my friend Stacy
Micelli and my sister Linda.

09:05.403 --> 09:07.537
- Mom, that's you.
- Name drop.

09:07.571 --> 09:09.072
We were in the denim district,

09:09.106 --> 09:11.675
waiting in line to buy
knock-off jean bras,

09:11.709 --> 09:13.710
when an elegant woman walked by.

09:13.744 --> 09:15.412
I looked up, she looked at me,

09:15.446 --> 09:17.280
and she gave me a wink
and the finger guns.

09:17.315 --> 09:22.385
Pew-pew! And that woman
was... Delta Burke.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.955
It was the briefest of gestures,

09:24.989 --> 09:27.023
but it meant so much to me.

09:27.058 --> 09:28.625
A Designing Woman.

09:28.659 --> 09:32.300
That moment helped design... this woman.

09:33.631 --> 09:36.433
And now a quick intermission
while I change into a leotard

09:36.467 --> 09:37.867
for the next part of the show:

09:37.891 --> 09:40.546
Chapter 32: TGI Lie-Days:

09:40.571 --> 09:42.639
Why you shouldn't date
any of the bartenders

09:42.673 --> 09:45.642
at TGI Fridays... especially Dave.

09:45.676 --> 09:47.310
- Unbelievable.
- Seriously,

09:47.345 --> 09:49.156
it's hard to believe Aunt
Gayle was close enough

09:49.180 --> 09:50.914
to have smelt-a the Delta.

09:50.948 --> 09:52.826
Yeah, hard to believe because
it didn't happen to her.

09:52.850 --> 09:54.417
It happened to me.

09:54.452 --> 09:57.287
Wait, Mom, are you saying
that Aunt Gayle stole

09:57.321 --> 09:59.932
your Delta Burke wink
and finger gun story?

09:59.957 --> 10:02.425
Yeah, it was me who
got winked and gunned.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.761
We had a connection. I'll
never forget her eyes.

10:04.795 --> 10:06.673
If it bothers you, you
should say something, Mom.

10:06.697 --> 10:08.098
Yeah, something vulgar.

10:08.132 --> 10:09.632
No, no, it's fine.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.401
It means so much to
her, let her have it.

10:11.435 --> 10:12.502
I've got a good life.

10:12.536 --> 10:14.571
And one hot son.

10:14.605 --> 10:16.139
More jerky? No?

10:16.173 --> 10:18.475
Would it help if we gave
each other trail names?

10:18.509 --> 10:20.510
I'm gonna call you... Friendly Breath.

10:20.544 --> 10:21.845
What's mine? Give me one.

10:21.879 --> 10:23.780
Please, just tell me
there's another way out.

10:23.814 --> 10:25.115
What about Cool Breeze?

10:25.149 --> 10:26.516
You think I could be a Cool Breeze?

10:26.550 --> 10:28.028
You know? Kind of see that? Like, uh...

10:28.052 --> 10:29.463
I don't know, you know
who I'm talking about?

10:29.487 --> 10:31.488
Austin, please, is there
another way out of here?

10:31.522 --> 10:33.690
I-I have a family, I-I can't sit here

10:33.724 --> 10:36.092
and eat jerky with you
for the next six days.

10:36.127 --> 10:38.128
Okay, fine.

10:38.162 --> 10:40.964
Well, there is one other way out.

10:40.998 --> 10:41.965
Really? What is it?

10:41.999 --> 10:44.200
Skylight.

10:44.235 --> 10:45.935
You can't be serious.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.505
- How would we even get up there?
- What?

10:48.539 --> 10:50.473
We've got a whole variety
of climbing options

10:50.508 --> 10:51.875
over on aisle 14.

10:51.909 --> 10:53.843
Uh, no to that. No.

10:53.878 --> 10:57.113
Well, the other option is me
and you doing this for six days.

10:57.148 --> 11:00.116
Cool Breeze and Friendly
Breath, bonding up a storm.

11:00.151 --> 11:02.519
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Breath and Breeze!

11:02.553 --> 11:05.055
Okay, let's climb.

11:05.089 --> 11:06.477
Great! This is gonna be fun.

11:06.502 --> 11:08.062
Quick question: how
big is your crotch?

11:08.087 --> 11:09.249
- What?
- For your harness,

11:09.274 --> 11:11.718
you look like a medium,
but I don't want to assume.

11:13.219 --> 11:14.452
This is so exciting.

11:14.487 --> 11:16.210
We're gonna climb to the skylight.

11:16.235 --> 11:17.969
What exactly is the plan?

11:18.003 --> 11:19.571
Well, I was thinking

11:19.605 --> 11:21.249
we could use a crossbow
to shoot a fishing line

11:21.274 --> 11:22.473
over that girder.

11:22.498 --> 11:25.243
- Okay.
- It's called "line launching."

11:25.277 --> 11:27.145
- Have you seen Cliffhanger?
- Oh, no.

11:27.179 --> 11:28.546
- What about Vertical Limit?
- No.

11:28.581 --> 11:30.281
Really? So good.

11:30.316 --> 11:32.327
But also terrifying, so I'm
glad you haven't seen them.

11:32.351 --> 11:33.952
Lots of people die in those movies.

11:33.986 --> 11:36.554
- Oh, my God.
- Anyway, once we're both up there,

11:36.589 --> 11:39.257
we crack the skylight with
an ice axe, aisle seven,

11:39.291 --> 11:41.392
then you're on the roof
and down the fire escape.

11:41.427 --> 11:43.428
Oh... I hate all of this.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.490
Hey, do you want the blue
gloves or the brown gloves?

11:45.515 --> 11:47.765
- Uh, whichever.
- How about this? On the count of three,

11:47.800 --> 11:49.267
we just say which ones we want, okay?

11:49.301 --> 11:50.668
One, two, three.

11:50.703 --> 11:51.940
- Blue.
- I don't care.

11:51.965 --> 11:53.432
Great! I'll take the blue.

11:53.893 --> 11:56.667
So now, when I look at
myself in the mirror,

11:56.690 --> 11:58.290
I do one of these...

11:58.325 --> 12:00.292
... and two of these. Pew! Pew!

12:00.327 --> 12:03.251
And... I'm flying Delta!

12:03.276 --> 12:05.397
Thank you! Thank you!

12:07.500 --> 12:09.568
- Mom.
- Oh. Oh, bravo!

12:09.603 --> 12:11.403
Bravo. Great job!

12:11.438 --> 12:13.739
Whew! Okay, so tell me
what worked and what didn't,

12:13.773 --> 12:15.140
and be honest.

12:15.175 --> 12:16.542
Just remember, I hate criticism.

12:16.576 --> 12:18.077
Mm, it all worked so well.

12:18.111 --> 12:19.478
Mm-hmm, uh-huh.
You didn't think

12:19.512 --> 12:21.080
the menstruation scene was too much?

12:21.114 --> 12:23.182
I think it would work
without the bubble machine,

12:23.216 --> 12:24.817
- but who am I to judge?
- Disagree.

12:24.851 --> 12:27.103
Let's be honest. The
show really gets going

12:27.128 --> 12:28.713
with that Delta Burke story.

12:28.738 --> 12:29.989
Tell us more about that!

12:31.591 --> 12:32.769
You know what I think?

12:32.794 --> 12:35.828
I think she saw a little
bit of herself in me.

12:35.862 --> 12:38.364
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that was it. Mm.

12:38.398 --> 12:39.875
Linda, you were there. What was it like

12:39.899 --> 12:41.400
when you saw Delta Burke wink at me?

12:41.434 --> 12:42.835
Yeah, what was it like?

12:42.869 --> 12:44.362
It was... great.

12:44.387 --> 12:45.671
It was really great.

12:45.705 --> 12:47.172
When she shined her light on me.

12:47.207 --> 12:49.875
Yeah, it was just so... Mm. Mm!

12:49.909 --> 12:51.543
Was it painful for you?

12:51.578 --> 12:53.846
Was it cold there in my shadow?

12:53.880 --> 12:56.417
Oh, it didn't happen to you,
okay?! It happened to me!

12:56.442 --> 12:57.850
- What?
- She winked at me!

12:57.884 --> 12:59.251
And finger-gunned me!

12:59.285 --> 13:02.370
You stole my story!
You Delta-burgled it!

13:02.395 --> 13:04.957
Oh, I see. You're jealous.

13:04.991 --> 13:07.526
Kids, let's go upstairs and
go to bed because it's late,

13:07.560 --> 13:08.904
and your father's probably wondering

13:08.928 --> 13:10.262
what we're still doing down here.

13:10.296 --> 13:12.097
Great show, Gayle,
except for all the lies.

13:12.132 --> 13:14.066
How dare you, Linda?!

13:14.100 --> 13:16.068
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
there's somebody else

13:16.102 --> 13:18.037
who was there. We have a witness.

13:18.071 --> 13:19.538
That little Amish boy!

13:19.572 --> 13:21.240
No. Stacy Micelli.

13:21.274 --> 13:23.314
Oh, yeah. Maybe we can find
her number and call her.

13:23.343 --> 13:24.754
She can tell us what really happened.

13:24.778 --> 13:26.245
Fine, then. Let's do it.

13:26.279 --> 13:27.713
We'll call Stacy Micelli,

13:27.747 --> 13:29.581
we'll wake her up,
and we'll settle this.

13:29.616 --> 13:31.150
Unless... you're scared.

13:31.184 --> 13:34.290
I'm... not... scared.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.220
Pew, pew.

13:35.255 --> 13:37.056
Don't you "pew, pew" me.

13:37.090 --> 13:39.658
- I "pew, pew" you! Pew! Pew!
- Uh, pew! Pew!

13:39.693 --> 13:41.737
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew,
pew-pew-pew-pew. Pew, pew, pew, pew.

13:41.761 --> 13:43.673
- Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
- Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, infinity!

13:43.697 --> 13:45.931
This is my favorite part
of the show so far!

13:45.965 --> 13:48.104
Sorry you had to wear
that teen harness, Bob.

13:48.129 --> 13:49.468
Oh, it's fine.

13:49.502 --> 13:52.838
So, when I get to the top, you
just do what I did, all right?

13:52.872 --> 13:54.940
Right.

13:54.974 --> 13:56.742
There we go.

13:56.776 --> 13:58.410
This would all be so much funner

13:58.445 --> 13:59.912
if you'd seen Vertical Limit!

13:59.946 --> 14:02.687
Okay, we're all tied off up here.

14:02.719 --> 14:05.691
- Climb on, Bob!
- Okay.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.920
I don't know if I can...

14:07.954 --> 14:09.922
... pull myself up.

14:09.956 --> 14:11.924
You can do this, Bob. Keep going!

14:11.958 --> 14:14.493
Am I almost there?

14:14.527 --> 14:15.928
Uh, sort of.

14:15.962 --> 14:18.664
So tired. So, so tired.

14:18.698 --> 14:20.599
Oh. I'm gonna take a break.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.701
Okay. This is really an early break.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.536
Actually, can I take
two breaks together?

14:24.571 --> 14:26.538
Bob, this is gonna be easy...

14:28.208 --> 14:29.641
Oh. Oh.

14:29.676 --> 14:32.831
Aah! Okay, okay, not good!

14:32.856 --> 14:36.331
- Austin, what happened?!
- Uh, well, to be honest,

14:36.356 --> 14:37.950
I don't know about those knots I tied.

14:37.984 --> 14:40.119
Wait. What does that
mean? Were they not knots?

14:40.153 --> 14:42.128
They were not not knots.

14:42.153 --> 14:43.654
They just, you know, weren't, like...

14:43.688 --> 14:44.957
They weren't, like, the best knots.

14:44.982 --> 14:46.949
What?! Don't you do this all the time?

14:46.974 --> 14:49.008
Uh, this was kind of my first time.

14:49.033 --> 14:51.902
What?! I thought you said you
used everything in the store.

14:51.919 --> 14:54.087
No, I said I demoed
everything in the store.

14:54.121 --> 14:55.822
Very different, okay?

14:55.856 --> 14:58.358
Look, the sales rep comes,
you know, we talk shop,

14:58.392 --> 15:01.328
he shows me the merch,
and... and then I go sell it.

15:01.362 --> 15:03.163
His name's Pablo!

15:03.197 --> 15:05.532
So you've never actually used
this stuff in the real world?

15:05.566 --> 15:07.200
I mean, not like Pablo.

15:07.234 --> 15:09.736
So, what if I, uh, uh,
try and pull on this?

15:09.770 --> 15:11.538
No, no, no, no, don't touch that rope!

15:11.572 --> 15:13.106
Aren't you attached to that rope?

15:13.140 --> 15:15.875
Not, like, that much.
Not as much as I'd like.

15:15.910 --> 15:17.944
Oh. Well, it's up to you now, Bob.

15:17.979 --> 15:19.412
Wait. What's up to me?!

15:19.447 --> 15:21.548
You got to climb out
of here and get help.

15:21.582 --> 15:22.916
How am I supposed to do that?!

15:22.950 --> 15:24.728
It's fine. It's fine.

15:24.753 --> 15:26.853
You're... you're just gonna have to...

15:26.887 --> 15:28.755
free-climb up to the skylight.

15:28.789 --> 15:30.690
Free-climb up to the skylight?!

15:30.725 --> 15:32.425
Yeah. I was trying to say it casually,

15:32.460 --> 15:34.227
you know, so you
wouldn't get freaked out.

15:34.261 --> 15:37.197
That didn't work. I-I'm
totally freaked out.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.184
Okay. Side note: I'm gonna
have to pee soon, okay?

15:39.209 --> 15:41.672
And at this angle, it's
gonna get weird fast.

15:43.358 --> 15:45.763
Is that for my pee, or in case I fall?

15:45.788 --> 15:46.989
Both, I guess.

15:47.023 --> 15:48.257
M-Mostly the fall.

15:48.291 --> 15:50.692
But I'm gonna fall in my own pee.

15:50.727 --> 15:52.995
Well, maybe hold it
then? Just a thought.

15:53.029 --> 15:54.530
I should've gone before I climbed.

15:54.564 --> 15:55.967
It's the first rule of climbing!

15:55.992 --> 15:58.000
That can't be the
first rule of climbing.

15:58.034 --> 16:00.269
All right, I'm-I'm
gonna climb the wall now.

16:00.303 --> 16:01.592
I can't believe I'm saying that.

16:01.617 --> 16:04.173
Should I just clip into
this safety rope right here?

16:04.207 --> 16:06.441
Sure! I mean, it's not
connected to anything, but

16:06.476 --> 16:08.010
sounds like you're getting into it!

16:08.044 --> 16:10.975
Oh, my God. Uh, this wall is for, like,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.311
advanced climbers, right?

16:12.336 --> 16:13.912
I mean, technically, it's for beginners

16:13.937 --> 16:16.272
but maybe, like, advanced beginners?

16:16.297 --> 16:19.464
Listen, Bob, I feel like
I want to say something.

16:19.489 --> 16:23.292
I... I realize now that
I'm... I'm not an outdoors guy.

16:23.506 --> 16:25.227
Maybe I never will be an outdoors guy.

16:25.261 --> 16:26.615
Maybe I'm just a poser

16:26.640 --> 16:29.164
who sells outdoor equipment
really, really well.

16:29.199 --> 16:31.200
And looks really, really good in it.

16:31.234 --> 16:33.135
Even right now probably. I don't know.

16:33.169 --> 16:35.804
Listen, Austin. I get it, I do.

16:35.838 --> 16:37.973
I-I love this stuff,
too, and I don't know

16:38.007 --> 16:39.841
if I'm actually that
serious about using it

16:39.876 --> 16:41.810
out in the wilderness, but I love it.

16:41.844 --> 16:43.545
And maybe that's okay.

16:43.580 --> 16:45.881
I mean, I was looking
at that folding shovel.

16:45.915 --> 16:49.218
I'm not even sure if that's what
it is, but I want one so much.

16:49.252 --> 16:50.851
Oh, the folding shovel.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.087
I have three.

16:52.121 --> 16:53.589
They're in my car.

16:53.623 --> 16:55.324
- I wish everything folded.
- Yeah.

16:55.358 --> 16:57.426
Ugh, but you know... I don't even know

16:57.460 --> 16:59.561
if I even want to hike
the Appalachian Trail.

16:59.596 --> 17:00.996
I just planned it because Lisa

17:01.030 --> 17:02.742
from the cycling department was going.

17:02.767 --> 17:04.098
She's so pretty.

17:04.133 --> 17:06.867
Austin, let-let's come back to
you in a minute. Is that okay?

17:06.903 --> 17:10.005
I just feel like I need to focus
on the climbing part right now.

17:10.039 --> 17:11.784
Just one more thing.
She smells like coconuts.

17:11.808 --> 17:13.709
That's it. Okay, all
right, climb on, Bob!

17:13.742 --> 17:16.744
So you're calling me at 11:45 p.m.

17:16.779 --> 17:20.214
to ask me if it was you or
Linda who Delta Burke winked at

17:20.250 --> 17:23.811
and finger-gunned 20
years ago in New York City?

17:23.851 --> 17:26.054
- Yes.
- And to see how you're doing. Hi.

17:26.089 --> 17:27.556
But mostly the other thing.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.891
Also, Linda's kids are
here... Tina, Gene and Louise.

17:29.926 --> 17:30.593
We're great.

17:30.618 --> 17:32.594
Don't mind us. We just
want to know the truth!

17:32.629 --> 17:35.597
- Please don't yell at me, strange boy.
- I like her!

17:35.632 --> 17:38.367
- Listen, here's what happened that day.
- Moment of truth.

17:38.401 --> 17:39.735
That wasn't Delta Burke.

17:39.760 --> 17:40.861
What?

17:40.886 --> 17:42.537
- It wasn't?
- Wha-What?

17:42.572 --> 17:44.640
First of all, she was speaking Italian.

17:44.674 --> 17:46.375
Second, she had a prosthetic leg.

17:46.409 --> 17:49.111
And third, Delta Burke was
shooting a movie-of-the-week

17:49.145 --> 17:51.046
in California at that very moment.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.948
We argued about this
for the rest of the trip,

17:52.982 --> 17:54.616
and then we never spoke again.

17:54.651 --> 17:57.328
But thanks so much for calling.

17:57.353 --> 17:59.321
It wasn't Delta Burke?

17:59.355 --> 18:00.989
I guess not.

18:01.024 --> 18:03.058
What a journey.

18:03.092 --> 18:04.559
You know what?

18:04.594 --> 18:06.895
I think Stacy is jealous.

18:06.929 --> 18:08.797
And I think it was Delta Burke,

18:08.831 --> 18:10.766
and it was you that Delta winked at.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.734
- Oh. You do?
- Yeah, I do.

18:12.769 --> 18:14.903
And you shouldn't change
a thing in your show.

18:14.937 --> 18:16.148
I mean, you could take some cuts.

18:16.172 --> 18:17.506
Shh. Tina, shh.

18:17.540 --> 18:18.895
Aw, Lin, thank you.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.976
Hey, I got something for you.

18:21.010 --> 18:22.411
Pew! Pew!

18:22.445 --> 18:25.080
Aw, right back at ya. Pew! Pew!

18:25.114 --> 18:27.416
I think I maybe don't
understand "pew, pew."

18:27.450 --> 18:29.618
Sometimes it's angry,
sometimes it's friendly.

18:29.652 --> 18:31.520
Is "pew, pew" like "aloha"?

18:31.554 --> 18:33.755
You're doing great, Bob!

18:33.790 --> 18:35.854
I can't see you 'cause I'm
facing the other direction,

18:35.879 --> 18:37.503
but it sounds like you're doing great.

18:37.527 --> 18:39.594
Thanks, Austin.

18:39.629 --> 18:41.596
Oh, I can see you!

18:41.631 --> 18:43.031
Ha, nice, Bob!

18:43.066 --> 18:44.666
You're almost up the wall!

18:44.701 --> 18:47.286
Oh, I hate rock
climbing. I know that now.

18:53.076 --> 18:54.776
Oh, my God, I did it.

18:54.811 --> 18:56.178
I climbed the wall.

18:56.212 --> 18:58.447
Whoa, whoa, I-I'm really high.

18:58.481 --> 19:01.016
O-Okay, now I just have to...

19:01.050 --> 19:04.328
scooch along this girder
over to the skylight.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.221
I love the way you say "scooch"!

19:06.255 --> 19:08.223
It's not technically
correct, but I do enjoy

19:08.257 --> 19:10.025
hearing you say things
you're doing, Bob.

19:10.059 --> 19:12.694
Okay, this really scary.

19:15.565 --> 19:18.533
Man, I wonder how high up we are.

19:18.568 --> 19:20.502
40, maybe 50 feet?

19:20.536 --> 19:22.371
Austin, please, not a good time.

19:22.405 --> 19:23.839
You're even higher than me.

19:23.873 --> 19:25.574
You're more like 60 feet up.

19:25.608 --> 19:27.142
Ha! Aren't you scared?

19:27.176 --> 19:29.476
No. No, Austin, not at all.

19:30.913 --> 19:32.914
I made it! I'm there!

19:32.949 --> 19:35.751
You did it! I think. I
can't tell. I'm twisting now.

19:35.785 --> 19:37.519
Okay, there you are.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.488
Man, that harness is tight!

19:39.522 --> 19:41.690
All right, here I go. I'm
gonna break the skylight.

19:41.731 --> 19:43.098
- Hey, Bob.
- Yeah?

19:43.126 --> 19:45.193
Before you go, I want
you to know that...

19:45.228 --> 19:46.561
I love you.

19:46.596 --> 19:49.064
I, uh... I-I love you, too.

19:49.098 --> 19:50.766
And, also, don't forget to get help.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.901
You're gonna have to
call, like, everybody.

19:52.935 --> 19:55.036
Uh, police, fire, my boss.

19:55.071 --> 19:56.772
Maybe Lisa from cycling.

19:56.806 --> 20:00.041
No. I know. I'm gonna get to
a phone and call everybody.

20:00.076 --> 20:02.944
Great! Now break that
skylight, Friendly Breath!

20:02.979 --> 20:04.913
You steely-eyed mountain man!

20:07.316 --> 20:08.850
Yes!

20:08.885 --> 20:10.786
You did it!

20:10.820 --> 20:13.088
I'm so proud of you, I'm crying, Bob!

20:14.624 --> 20:17.726
Some of it's pee, but
most of it's tears!

20:17.760 --> 20:20.629
Yes!

20:20.663 --> 20:22.297
Yes!

20:23.666 --> 20:26.468
So it was Delta Burke? I-I'm confused.

20:26.502 --> 20:28.136
It's whoever you want it to be.

20:28.171 --> 20:29.969
Aren't we all Delta Burke?

20:29.994 --> 20:31.273
That's right, Gene.

20:31.307 --> 20:34.209
So, did we talk enough about
how I climbed a 40-foot wall

20:34.243 --> 20:36.125
and then escaped through a skylight?

20:36.150 --> 20:37.610
I think we covered it pretty well,

20:37.635 --> 20:39.314
and we definitely believe you.

20:39.348 --> 20:41.983
Watch out. Mom's gonna start
telling people she did it.

20:42.018 --> 20:44.085
It's nice you made a new best friend.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.754
Austin and I are not best friends.

20:45.788 --> 20:47.956
We're just going shopping
together next weekend.

20:47.990 --> 20:50.292
We're gonna check out this
new outdoor omelet pan.

20:50.326 --> 20:52.461
You lost me at "outdoor,"
you had me at "omelet,"

20:52.495 --> 20:54.229
and then you lost me again at "pan."
