WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:03.937
(siren wailing)

00:03.937 --> 00:06.206
MURTAUGH:
Stop! LAPD!

00:06.206 --> 00:09.142
Let's get him,
partner.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.283
I think I'm getting
too old for this.

00:17.551 --> 00:18.785
Suck it up, Avery.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.554
He's getting away.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.098
(engine revs)

00:31.098 --> 00:33.033
(tires screeching)

00:34.234 --> 00:35.469
He's gonna hit us!

00:35.469 --> 00:37.137
(shouts)

00:37.137 --> 00:39.540
Not today, partner.

00:41.608 --> 00:44.244
(whoops)

00:45.479 --> 00:46.713
(tires screech)

00:53.921 --> 00:55.455
I'm not going back to jail.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.830
(whoops)

01:04.865 --> 01:07.067
(grunts)
(Murtaugh whoops)

01:07.935 --> 01:09.336
Wow.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.507
You just got Roger'd.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.275
MAN:
Did you really say that?

01:15.275 --> 01:16.677
Of course.

01:16.677 --> 01:20.914
It's a crucial part of a move
I like to call the Roger.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.684
Things must have been pretty
wild back when you were a cop.

01:23.684 --> 01:24.718
Oh, no, I'm still a cop.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.687
That was... that was,
like, ten years ago.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.789
But you said
someone had a mullet.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.424
(laughing):
Well,

01:30.424 --> 01:33.026
I'm taking creative license.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.127
(bell rings)

01:34.127 --> 01:36.563
That is all the time
we have for today.

01:36.563 --> 01:40.133
Let's hear a round of applause
for Detective Murtaugh.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.905
You are

01:44.905 --> 01:46.173
a natural up here.
Thank you.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.841
I got a feeling
your class is gonna be

01:47.841 --> 01:48.909
a cadet favorite
in no time.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.979
My class? No, I'm just
a guest lecturer.

01:51.979 --> 01:55.215
Yeah, but you were recommended
for a full-time gig.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.117
I thought you guys
just bring in

01:57.117 --> 01:58.952
distinguished
detectives to speak.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.220
Oh, no, no, no.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.456
Somebody reached out to us.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.224
Gave us the impression
you were retiring.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.059
Who?

02:06.059 --> 02:07.060
It was you?

02:07.060 --> 02:08.628
Avery and I were having lunch.

02:08.628 --> 02:12.199
Avery. Nothing good comes
from having lunch with that man.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.167
He mentioned the
guest lecture program,

02:14.167 --> 02:16.103
and I thought
you would enjoy it.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.471
I did.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.107
And the kids,
they loved my stories,

02:20.107 --> 02:21.942
especially the Roger.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.544
You told them about the Roger?

02:24.544 --> 02:25.345
No.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.014
Not that Roger.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.082
(chuckles)

02:29.082 --> 02:31.151
The professional Roger.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.620
But that's not the point.
The point is,

02:33.620 --> 02:36.590
you were conspiring
to put me out to pasture.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.258
(chuckles):
Oh, my gosh, Roger.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.560
That is ridiculous.
Just the other night,

02:40.560 --> 02:43.397
you were talking about
what you might like to do next.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.198
That was pillow talk.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.668
Well, you got me
to thinking, too.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.570
Um, starting my own practice

02:50.570 --> 02:53.206
hasn't been as
fulfilling as I hoped.

02:53.206 --> 02:54.908
Well, a job is a job.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.844
The fulfillment comes
in actually doing the job.

02:57.844 --> 03:02.849
Okay, as inspiring
as that is...

03:02.849 --> 03:07.387
...I think there
could be more for us.

03:07.387 --> 03:10.457
Maybe it's time to think
about our second act.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.427
What are you picturing?

03:13.427 --> 03:16.396
I don't know.

03:16.396 --> 03:21.001
(chuckles)
You and me... the lido deck...

03:21.001 --> 03:23.003
cruising the Amalfi Coast.

03:23.003 --> 03:26.573
You're talking
about us retiring?

03:26.573 --> 03:29.509
Just slowing down a bit.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.545
You know, taking time
for ourselves,

03:31.545 --> 03:33.880
without any cases interfering.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.185
That sounds like
a wonderful second act.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.619
Eventually.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.024
ERICA:
You weren't exaggerating.
COLE: What, the room?

03:44.024 --> 03:47.360
Can't be the first time you
spent the night at a motel.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.897
Well, one that rents
by the hour.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.299
Hey, this is a classy place.

03:52.299 --> 03:53.567
Supposed to be temporary.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.203
I thought I was gonna move
back in with my ex,

03:56.203 --> 03:57.471
but that wasn't meant to be.
Bzzz!

03:57.471 --> 04:00.307
Ooh. Nice use of the
emotional safe word.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.575
Great system, right?

04:01.575 --> 04:04.010
I developed it with my ex
after the first time we...

04:04.010 --> 04:06.613
Bzzz!
Oh, good.

04:06.613 --> 04:07.747
Touché.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.118
I like this thing
that we're doing.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.152
No complaints here.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.489
Fun, easy. Why make
things all complicated?

04:15.489 --> 04:20.160
What could possibly be
complicated about this?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.595
(knock on door)

04:21.595 --> 04:24.197
Oh, crap, I lost track of time.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.832
What, is our hour up already?

04:25.832 --> 04:27.300
Oh, boy. It's Maya.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.370
Natalie just dropped her off
on her way out of town.
Oh, okay.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.974
Hi.
COLE: Hey, kiddo.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.208
You're early.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.410
Yeah. Uh, who's she?

04:37.410 --> 04:38.712
Plumber.
Housekeeping.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.214
Uh, housekeeping plumber.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.316
She's wearing a dress and heels.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.551
High-end service.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.254
One of those weird
L.A. things.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.489
But, boy, can she
unclog a toilet.

04:49.489 --> 04:52.159
Sure can.
And I got to get going,

04:52.159 --> 04:55.695
because the tub in 25
is not gonna snake itself.

MURTAUGH: It was like

06:14.341 --> 06:16.543
I mean, one minute
I'm on top of the world.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.979
These cadets are hanging on
to my every word.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.314
And then the next,
Trish is telling me

06:21.314 --> 06:23.216
I need to start a second act.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.485
Second act? You're still
in the middle of your first.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.487
I know.
That's what I say.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.822
I mean, look at me.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.725
I'm in my prime.
SCORSESE:
I don't know.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.759
Trish might be
onto something.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.262
You should probably
listen to her.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.596
Shut up, Scorsese.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.832
This is partner banter.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.603
Mark Hardy, age 41.

06:43.603 --> 06:46.473
Died of an aneurysm caused
by blunt force trauma.

06:46.473 --> 06:48.608
You're not joking.
Looks like he was on

06:48.608 --> 06:50.143
the losing end
of a brutal fight.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.012
And he had livor mortis
pooling in his chest.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.880
So someone moved him
to the gym postmortem.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.483
You said "Hardy,"
as in the name on the gym?

06:56.483 --> 06:58.752
That's my little brother.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.353
This is the first piece
of equipment

07:00.353 --> 07:02.122
I ever bought for the gym.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.624
I taught him everything
he knows on that bag.

07:04.624 --> 07:05.992
You were his trainer, too?

07:05.992 --> 07:07.794
Yeah, for a while.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.296
But Mark's career
was pretty much over.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.064
He hadn't booked a real
gig in over a year.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.899
Well, he scrapped
with someone last night.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.901
His knuckles are
all bruised up.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.637
Yeah. After legit
work dried up,

07:17.637 --> 07:20.674
he started working with
this rich-kid investor.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.510
He hooked him up with
this off-book circuit.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.544
"Off-book."

07:24.544 --> 07:26.646
Like an underground
type of thing?

07:26.646 --> 07:29.449
Yeah, no rules, no limits.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.784
Dangerous stuff.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.319
Do you know where
he was last night

07:32.319 --> 07:33.253
or who he fought?

07:33.253 --> 07:35.588
Mark wouldn't tell me
about his fights.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.923
He knew I didn't approve.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.758
Any chance they were
trying to send a message

07:38.758 --> 07:40.360
by leaving him here?
I doubt it.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.597
They had to cover their tracks,
leave him somewhere.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.535
I think they were just
bringing him home.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.870
Look, I'm sorry.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.274
It's just, Mark's wife, Maria,

07:54.274 --> 07:58.545
she begged him a thousand times
to retire.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.413
Excuse me.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.815
See, Murtaugh?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.616
Maybe he should have
listened to his wife.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.226
TRISH (laughs):
Don't get me wrong.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.396
I love my clients.
It's just that...

08:16.396 --> 08:18.231
Feels like you're
running in place, right?
Yes.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.533
And especially since the D.A.
wants to plead out

08:20.533 --> 08:23.169
every single case;
it's so frustrating.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.537
You're fighting the
individual battles, but it's

08:24.537 --> 08:26.439
the institution, it's the
system that's the problem.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.774
Exactly.
What am I gonna do?

08:27.774 --> 08:29.576
Hi. I'm meeting
Captain Avery.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.878
Huh? Change the whole
system myself?

08:31.878 --> 08:34.514
What are you smiling about?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.615
Hold that thought.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.450
AVERY: Perfect timing.
Cynthia Hahn,

08:37.450 --> 08:39.252
meet...
Trish Murtaugh.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.520
What a pleasure.
Oh.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.921
Captain Avery's told me so much.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.190
Oh, I guess I'm at
a disadvantage.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.959
Cynthia is a
political consultant.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.362
I met her on my
city council campaign.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.332
For the record, I told him
that those buttons were

08:52.332 --> 08:54.601
A-very bad idea...
AVERY: Mmm...

08:54.601 --> 08:56.002
AVERY:
They were bad.
...and I was right.

08:56.002 --> 08:59.572
Oh, so you are running again.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.275
Okay, um, did not bring
my checkbook.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.511
Not me. Cynthia's
looking for someone

09:04.511 --> 09:05.845
to run for district attorney.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.313
CYNTHIA:
Mm-hmm.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.448
Someone who's put in their time

09:08.448 --> 09:11.518
with the public defender's
office, in the private sector,

09:11.518 --> 09:13.286
and for the Innocence Project.

09:13.286 --> 09:18.425
Maybe she has a cop husband
and three photogenic kids.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.360
(laughs)
Me?

09:20.360 --> 09:23.763
Avery, is this a joke?

09:23.763 --> 09:26.900
You said she was interested.
She doesn't seem interested.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.635
I said she would be interested.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.336
Will you look at that?
I have to run.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.205
Avery...
Why don't you two talk
about this over lunch.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.874
Whatever you want,
it's on me.

09:36.876 --> 09:40.914
Uh, I am flattered, but...

09:40.914 --> 09:42.615
I don't know anything
about politics.

09:42.615 --> 09:45.852
Well, the first rule is never
say no to a free meal.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.821
(chuckles)
Avery can still

09:47.821 --> 09:50.990
buy us lunch, even if
he's wasting our time.

09:50.990 --> 09:55.094
But something tells me
that he isn't.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.366
SCORSESE:
The tox report showed he had

10:00.366 --> 10:03.169
a near-lethal dose
of ketamine in his blood.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.539
And bruising around
the injection point indicates

10:06.539 --> 10:07.807
it wasn't his choice.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.877
Someone gave him a sedative
before a fight?

10:10.877 --> 10:12.245
Must not have wanted him

10:12.245 --> 10:14.214
to come out alive.
GUTE: Hey, Murtaugh.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.649
I heard you were at
the Academy yesterday.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.485
My roommate said
you're her new teacher.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.787
Yeah. Old guy's being
put out to pasture.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.590
No one's being put out
to any pastures.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.258
And it was a guest lecture.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.627
Yeah, she said you spent
the whole time

10:27.627 --> 10:29.596
bragging about some kung fu

10:29.596 --> 10:31.898
flying kick
you did years ago.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.267
She is referring to the Roger,

10:34.267 --> 10:36.169
my signature move.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.303
Signature move?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.137
Yeah.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.339
I've been here,
like, ten years,

10:39.339 --> 10:41.508
and I have never seen it.

10:41.508 --> 10:45.478
You want me to do it here, now,
in the morgue?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.515
See, I told her you could never
get your leg up that high.

10:48.515 --> 10:51.451
Is there another reason why
you are bothering me right...?

10:51.451 --> 10:53.820
Yes, sir.
Parker Adams.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.823
Bankrolled our vic's career
for the past year.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.591
Surprise. He's got
a half-million-dollar

10:58.591 --> 11:00.693
life insurance policy
on Mark Hardy.

11:00.693 --> 11:04.464
Sounds like motive. All right,
Cole and I will go talk to him.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.598
Hey, while you're out there,

11:05.598 --> 11:07.500
if it's the right time
and place, and you feel like

11:07.500 --> 11:08.902
breaking out that move...

11:08.902 --> 11:10.870
You know, like,
if you still can do it.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.740
Oh, I can still do it,
all right.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.975
You trust me.

11:18.611 --> 11:19.746
COLE:
So you just

11:19.746 --> 11:21.748
throw your badge,
and then you kick 'em?

11:21.748 --> 11:23.616
No, you Philistine.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.718
It's a multi-step process.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.153
First, you toss,

11:27.153 --> 11:29.622
and then you just
take two steps.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.190
You plant and pivot.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.025
Kee-yah!

11:32.025 --> 11:34.594
Like a pirouette.
Not a pirouette.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.496
Like a... like a pivot.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.264
Like a manly pivot.

11:38.264 --> 11:41.634
Anyway, you come in
flying foot first.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.737
I can't wait
to see it in action.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.773
LAPD. We're looking
for Parker Adams.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.641
This way.
(phone ringing)

11:50.443 --> 11:53.146
It's Maya's school.
Natalie's out of town.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.048
Mind if we hang
back for a sec?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.483
Yeah, I got this.
Sure you want to go in alone?

11:57.483 --> 12:01.821
I think I can handle a trust
fund kid alone for two minutes.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.291
Detective Cole.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.794
Hello, Mr. Cole.
This is Miss Dowd.

12:07.794 --> 12:10.029
Dowd? I feel like
I should know that name.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.264
I'm the vice principal.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.433
You get e-mails from me
once a week.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.335
Oh, right.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.769
I love your e-mails.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.404
Is everything okay with Maya?

12:22.542 --> 12:24.210
Great vintage.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.679
Better be for five K a bottle.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.781
I'd offer you a glass,
Detective,

12:28.781 --> 12:30.383
but, uh, you're on the job.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.087
Gee, investing in MMA fighters
must be lucrative.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.222
Sometimes. Pick the right guy.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.491
What kind of guy
was Mark Hardy?

12:38.491 --> 12:41.494
Ah. Yeah, terrible thing
that happened. Devastating.

12:41.494 --> 12:45.231
Yeah, I can see you're
really broken up about it.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.367
Well, it was more of a
professional relationship.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.303
I mean, tragic, but I really
don't know anything about it.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.839
If you don't mind, we're
in the middle of something.

12:52.839 --> 12:54.140
Mind seeing the officer out?

12:54.140 --> 12:56.576
Come on, man, let's go.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.379
You assaulting an officer?

12:59.379 --> 13:02.382
DOWD: Unfortunately, Maya has
been suspended for two days.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.251
During her debate practice
today, she started a fight.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.886
Maya?

13:06.886 --> 13:07.954
You sure you got the right kid?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.088
Maya's a good kid.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.957
We just don't know
what's gotten into her.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.825
(grunting, clattering)

13:16.329 --> 13:17.196
Drugs.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.132
Excuse me?
Got to go.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.215
(shouting)

13:44.357 --> 13:46.359
(yells)

13:51.197 --> 13:52.765
(groans)

13:52.765 --> 13:54.033
(grunting)

13:54.033 --> 13:55.435
Was that the Roger?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.770
I pictured it
differently in my head.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.172
Need a hand?

13:59.172 --> 14:02.508
I'm fine. I don't need help.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.510
Okay.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.749
DOWD:
Mr. Cole,

14:09.749 --> 14:11.284
do you have any idea where Maya

14:11.284 --> 14:14.654
might have picked up
such aggressive behavior?

14:14.654 --> 14:18.524
Well, I hate to say it, but
her mom's got quite a temper.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.793
Well, I'm still waiting
for Tommy's parents to arrive.

14:20.793 --> 14:23.362
Wait, that was Tommy
in the hallway?

14:23.362 --> 14:25.631
He's huge. Maya beat him
in a fight? That's awesome.

14:25.631 --> 14:29.068
That is not the administration's
perspective, Mr. Cole.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.070
Right. Yeah.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.106
Fighting is bad.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.108
You definitely had to
suspend her for that one.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.442
I'll tell her no more fighting,

14:36.442 --> 14:38.044
get her back here
in a couple days.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.246
Maybe I should talk
with Dr. Flynn.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.248
No. No, no, no, no, no.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.050
I can handle this, okay?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.184
I know my daughter.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.552
She's a great kid.
I agree.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.690
In my experience, when a kid
like Maya starts acting out,

14:50.690 --> 14:53.526
it's because something
might be going on at home.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.095
Yeah.

14:56.095 --> 14:59.098
Her mom's getting married.
Maybe that's it.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.100
You could try listening to Maya,

15:01.100 --> 15:03.936
having an open
and honest dialogue.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.806
Open and honest.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.976
Yeah, okay. I can do that.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.487
MURTAUGH:
We found quite the array

15:21.487 --> 15:24.190
of illicit drugs
in your house, Parker.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.658
So you better start spilling.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.193
Here's the thing.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.462
You searched my house
without a warrant,

15:29.462 --> 15:32.064
you broke
a priceless antique vase,

15:32.064 --> 15:34.667
and you smashed your foot
through my wall.

15:34.667 --> 15:38.905
Well, that was, uh, part
of a sophisticated move that...

15:38.905 --> 15:41.307
Pretty sure the sophisticated
lawyer I have on retainer's

15:41.307 --> 15:43.242
gonna have me
out of here in no time.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.645
You seem very confident
for a man

15:45.645 --> 15:49.448
with a half-a-million-dollar
motive to kill Mark Hardy.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.750
(laughs softly)

15:50.750 --> 15:52.151
The life insurance policy?

15:52.151 --> 15:53.920
(quietly):
The life insurance.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.955
Did you even read
the fine print?

16:07.266 --> 16:08.701
Did you forget
your reading glasses?

16:08.701 --> 16:09.535
I can read it.

16:09.535 --> 16:12.038
Well, it says
that the policy is void

16:12.038 --> 16:13.673
if there are drugs
found in his system.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.375
Says that, I think,
right here, clear as...

16:16.375 --> 16:17.777
Look, I don't even know
why you're hassling me.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.313
I mean, Mark's brother was
the one sleeping with his wife.

16:25.151 --> 16:28.454
Frank? The trainer?

16:28.454 --> 16:29.455
You got it.

16:29.455 --> 16:30.489
(grunts)

16:30.489 --> 16:31.958
Did you just groan, old man?

16:31.958 --> 16:34.994
No.
Maybe I should take a
policy out on you, huh?

16:36.996 --> 16:39.398
COLE: You better get used to
this. You keep down this path,

16:39.398 --> 16:42.602
you will find yourself in a
whole lot of bullpens like this.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.271
Or you can tell me
why you shoved Tommy.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.206
Because he told
the entire debate team

16:47.206 --> 16:49.208
that I couldn't
argue family values

16:49.208 --> 16:51.811
because I don't have
a real family.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.146
Oh.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.748
That's not very nice.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.319
But you didn't
have to shove him.

17:00.319 --> 17:02.755
Come on. Talk to me.

17:02.755 --> 17:06.058
We can have an open
and honest dialogue about this.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.295
Your plumber is here.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.665
Why don't you go have an open
and honest dialogue with her?

17:12.665 --> 17:16.802
Her name is Erica.
She's not really my plumber.

17:16.802 --> 17:18.204
Duh.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.872
(quietly):
Okay.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.475
Um...

17:22.475 --> 17:25.711
This is Erica.
She's actually my girlf...

17:25.711 --> 17:27.513
No. Coworker.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.582
Lady. Woman. Uh...
I don't know.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.184
Dad, just stop.
I'm embarrassed for you.

17:32.184 --> 17:33.519
Okay.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.922
It's nice to meet you,
officially.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.123
Don't get too attached.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.424
He's not the kind of guy
that sticks around.

17:38.424 --> 17:39.558
Maya.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.260
He'll probably
just get you pregnant

17:41.260 --> 17:43.029
and then abandon you
for 12 years.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.097
(laughs):
Oh. Ooh, I hope not.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.299
Maya Ann Flynn,
that's enough.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.401
Go to the conference
room now.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.606
Wow.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.974
Just for the record,

17:54.974 --> 17:55.975
I didn't abandon her.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.043
It was more of...

17:57.043 --> 17:59.145
(stammers)
That was too much.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.681
I... It's okay. I get it.
Kids are a lot.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.616
We're gonna keep this thing
light, though, right?

18:03.616 --> 18:04.450
Mm-hmm.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.851
Just pretend
none of this happened?

18:05.851 --> 18:07.119
Yeah, we're good.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.487
Yeah, I'll-I'll see you later?

18:08.487 --> 18:10.790
Yeah.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.259
Maya just totally
sunk me with Erica.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.261
Why would she do that?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.063
You've been back
less than a year.

18:17.063 --> 18:20.099
Kid's still trying to figure
out if she can trust you.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.935
And then you lied
about the plumber.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.470
I know.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.039
Erica and I are just trying
to keep things uncomplicated.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.674
Well, that ship
might have sailed.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.343
You're so
insightful, Roger.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.778
Not just insightful, but wise.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.682
There's our guy.

18:36.682 --> 18:37.850
Wise as in...

18:37.850 --> 18:40.219
old and wise?

18:40.219 --> 18:42.722
No. What's going on?

18:42.722 --> 18:46.225
That punk kid
really got into my head.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.994
Got me thinking

18:47.994 --> 18:49.195
maybe Trish is right.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.596
No.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.331
You're in the best shape
of your life.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.533
Your reflexes are
as sharp as a tack.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.903
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

18:57.903 --> 18:59.372
Let's go. Frank, Frank!

18:59.372 --> 19:01.207
Got to run, Roger.
Follow me.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.442
Where's the money, Frank?

19:03.442 --> 19:05.811
The Swede's money, where is it?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.781
Hey, guys, what money
are we talking about?

19:08.781 --> 19:10.583
Drive! Go, go! Now!

19:11.951 --> 19:14.820
(siren wailing)

19:17.690 --> 19:19.592
(tires screeching)

19:19.592 --> 19:21.627
Where's the Swede's money?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.696
(grunting)

19:37.843 --> 19:38.911
(tires screeching)

19:41.013 --> 19:42.782
Come on, Frank, let's go.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.755
(thudding)

19:49.755 --> 19:52.958
Oh, my God,
wha-what have I done?

19:58.731 --> 20:00.533
(panting)

20:00.533 --> 20:01.967
Look at those reflexes.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.336
So sharp.

20:04.336 --> 20:06.872
Frank?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.711
GUTE: So, what'd the guys
in the van want with you?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.646
The big blond guy's the Swede.
Heard a rumor

20:13.646 --> 20:15.648
that Mark tried to rip him off--
50 grand.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.850
GUTE: Why'd Mark need
that kind of dough?

20:17.850 --> 20:19.719
FRANK:
Well, why'd Mark do anything?

20:19.719 --> 20:22.121
He's chasing fame and fortune,
like always.

20:22.121 --> 20:25.825
And if it's true, I guess
he tried to take a shortcut.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.426
And what's the Swede's deal?

20:27.426 --> 20:28.961
How'd Mark get
involved with him?

20:28.961 --> 20:31.297
Oh, he used to be
a brawler himself.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.132
Known for fighting dirty.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.868
Now he runs
the off-book circuit.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.571
He preys on, like, old,
washed-up fighters

20:38.571 --> 20:39.939
with nowhere to go.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.907
GUTE: Do you have any idea
where we can find him?
No.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.911
I told the other guys I did
my best to stay out of all that.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.982
So your brother got caught up,
but you got out. Why?

20:52.017 --> 20:55.754
I woke up one day
not as sharp as I used to be.

20:55.754 --> 20:59.191
And I thought to myself,
"What am I doing here,

20:59.191 --> 21:02.695
chasing a past glory
that'll never come back?"

21:09.001 --> 21:11.437
(elevator bell dings)

21:14.874 --> 21:17.643
Hey. What are you
still doing here?

21:17.643 --> 21:19.044
That rich kid
you picked up--

21:19.044 --> 21:21.380
his lawyer is a real
pain in the ass.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.516
Right.
Sorry about that.

21:23.516 --> 21:27.419
I'm also sorry about...
you know.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.355
We're not gonna
talk about it because...

21:29.355 --> 21:32.391
you know, we don't talk about
those kinds of things, but, uh,

21:32.391 --> 21:34.727
I'm in way over
my head with Maya.

21:36.328 --> 21:37.963
Okay.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.166
Well, we're not
talking about it,

21:40.166 --> 21:41.667
but, hypothetically,

21:41.667 --> 21:45.437
I may also have been
a 12-year-old girl,

21:45.437 --> 21:47.006
so I...
(elevator bell dings)

21:50.176 --> 21:51.510
Wait. Hold on.

21:51.510 --> 21:52.678
Here's the thing.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.346
I don't even know what
she's talking about.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.816
I thought everything was going
great these past six months.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.585
Sure, but you can't
erase 12 years

21:59.585 --> 22:01.687
of a person's childhood
in six months.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.756
But you see me. I'm here now.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.492
I see a fun, casual guy

22:06.492 --> 22:10.062
who lives in a motel, nothing
too serious tying him down.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.565
Maya probably sees
the same thing.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.034
You want me to be more serious?

22:15.034 --> 22:16.402
I don't.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.504
I like what we have
because it's not serious.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.806
I think it works for us,
because frankly,

22:20.806 --> 22:23.776
this thing has
an expiration date.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.145
Right.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.881
But a father-daughter
relationship,

22:28.881 --> 22:32.551
hypothetically, that's forever.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.353
I know that.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.721
I'm not going anywhere.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.657
But does she know that?

22:45.598 --> 22:47.099
Hey, where'd you go?

22:47.099 --> 22:48.667
Thought you were gonna
bust my balls

22:48.667 --> 22:50.502
about my technique.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.971
You had it
under control.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.372
Yeah, you better
believe it.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.573
Frank's alibi cleared;

22:54.573 --> 22:56.141
he was at the wife's
house all night.

22:56.141 --> 22:57.743
Any luck tracking down
the Swede?

22:57.743 --> 23:00.145
Yeah. Got a name: Sven Olsen.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.481
Put a BOLO out.
Big dude like that,

23:02.481 --> 23:03.816
somebody's got
to spot him soon, right?

23:03.816 --> 23:05.351
Let me know when the BOLO hits.

23:05.351 --> 23:06.952
You staying out here?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.755
Just trying to stay sharp.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.669
(chuckles)

23:23.669 --> 23:25.237
(front door opens)
Oh, my goodness.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.405
(door closes)

23:26.405 --> 23:27.873
All right, baby, I'm in.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.241
That's great, baby.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.442
That's great.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.511
In... in for what?

23:32.511 --> 23:35.447
You, me, the lido deck.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.483
Sipping prosecco
under the stars.

23:37.483 --> 23:40.319
Doing the one Roger
that I can still pull off.

23:40.319 --> 23:43.656
(laughs) As much as
I appreciate this,

23:43.656 --> 23:45.357
where is this coming from?

23:45.357 --> 23:48.160
Did something happen?

23:48.160 --> 23:52.231
I went to the shooting
range after work.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.766
Whoa, look at you.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.434
That's a perfect shot.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.269
No. I missed two.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.704
Roger, come on.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.339
This is still
pretty damn good.

24:00.339 --> 24:03.809
Well, you got to be perfect
to do this job.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.744
I can't afford to make mistakes.

24:05.744 --> 24:08.414
And today,
I made a few big ones.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.516
Okay, so you had a bad day.

24:10.516 --> 24:11.951
It happens.
(wine pouring)

24:11.951 --> 24:14.820
You just got to
get back on the wagon.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.255
What happened to the lido deck?

24:16.255 --> 24:17.456
Honey.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.825
The lido deck
will still be there.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.660
But like you said,

24:21.660 --> 24:23.162
way down the road.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.698
Four to eight years,

24:25.698 --> 24:28.000
to be exact.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.369
Why four to eight years exactly?

24:30.369 --> 24:34.707
Because it is
the term length for...

24:34.707 --> 24:36.308
(whispering):
the district attorney.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.976
(chuckles)

24:37.976 --> 24:39.244
(laughing):
I know. Honey, listen.

24:39.244 --> 24:41.580
It just, it's...
Yes!
District attorney?

24:41.580 --> 24:43.015
The opportunity
just fell in my lap.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.217
Avery thought that I could run.
Avery.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.386
What-what happened
to no more lunches?
Okay.

24:47.386 --> 24:51.190
Honey, I know it's crazy,
I mean, politics, but...

24:51.190 --> 24:54.026
this might be my chance to
finally make a real difference.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.928
(laughing): Right.
What?

24:55.928 --> 24:59.565
So, all this talk about
slowing down applies to me,

24:59.565 --> 25:01.000
not you.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.901
Teaching and politics,

25:02.901 --> 25:05.738
they're both
exciting new chapters.
No.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.574
One's an exciting new chapter.

25:08.574 --> 25:11.043
The other is an obituary.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.178
I can't believe this.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.279
Neither can I.

25:14.279 --> 25:16.515
I get a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,

25:16.515 --> 25:22.488
and you find a way to make it
about your existential crisis.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.356
Really.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.393
And-and where are you going?

25:27.393 --> 25:29.828
I'm going to do the Trish.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.766
Alone?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.701
(distant sirens wailing)

26:04.530 --> 26:06.732
(knocking on door)

26:15.641 --> 26:17.409
Maria, you okay?
(sniffling)

26:19.044 --> 26:21.313
What happened?
That big guy,
the Swede.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.649
He was waiting for
me when I got home.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.551
Son of a bitch.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.086
He came after me, too.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.087
He kept asking me about
some money Mark stole.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.356
Gave me 24 hours to
bring it to him.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.958
But I don't know
about any money, Frank.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.160
Mark stashed it here.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.663
Did the Swede tell you
where he's gonna be?

26:37.663 --> 26:39.798
Yeah, somewhere
in Chinatown.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.567
But we got to go
to the cops, Frank.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.902
I can't do that.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.239
What are you gonna do?

26:48.841 --> 26:51.210
I'm gonna put an end
to this thing.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.821
Hey.

27:04.723 --> 27:07.392
If you're wondering why
I'm still here, plumber,

27:07.392 --> 27:10.028
I got suspended.

27:10.028 --> 27:12.364
You mean housekeeping
plumber, right?

27:13.565 --> 27:15.400
I'm sorry about
that whole thing.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.136
Not my proudest moment.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.538
What'd you do to get suspended?

27:19.538 --> 27:21.306
Shoved a kid in debate club.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.609
Yeah, highly suspendable move.

27:25.043 --> 27:26.678
You know... (sighs)

27:26.678 --> 27:28.347
I got suspended
quite a bit

27:28.347 --> 27:30.082
when I was your age.
You?

27:30.082 --> 27:31.683
Oh, yeah.

27:31.683 --> 27:34.152
My parents got divorced,
and, well...

27:34.152 --> 27:35.854
my dad had a plumber, too.

27:35.854 --> 27:39.057
Only, she was also
my former babysitter.

27:39.057 --> 27:40.092
So let me guess.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.894
You grew to love her
or something?

27:41.894 --> 27:43.896
Is that supposed to be
the lesson here?

27:43.896 --> 27:45.464
Definitely not.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.766
I hated her with the
passion of 1,000 suns

27:47.766 --> 27:51.904
until the day my dad
finally divorced her, too.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.305
Oh.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.742
I was angry at the world.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.911
My dad tried so hard
to get through to me,

27:58.911 --> 28:01.580
but I just wanted
to make him suffer.

28:02.614 --> 28:06.118
It was... it sucked.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.620
Yeah, that sucks.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.659
If you need to
hate me, I get it.

28:13.659 --> 28:15.727
But I kind of hope
you'll find a better way

28:15.727 --> 28:17.162
to deal with
it than I did.

28:17.162 --> 28:22.100
Because you seem like a
much smarter kid than I was.

28:31.143 --> 28:34.112
AVERY: Gute said you
called in "old" this morning?

28:34.112 --> 28:35.747
I said I had a cold.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.416
And that I'd be working
from home today.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.617
Good, because
I didn't know how

28:38.617 --> 28:40.519
to fill out the paperwork
on the other one.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.254
I'm trying to track down
any mention

28:42.254 --> 28:43.755
of the Swede in our files.

28:43.755 --> 28:46.725
And obsessing over
target practice?

28:47.793 --> 28:50.429
Let me guess.
You and Trish had lunch.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.098
She said you were upset because
you didn't shoot a perfect 12.

28:53.098 --> 28:57.502
No, I'm upset because it
clearly shows that I'm too old

28:57.502 --> 28:58.971
to be in the field.
Come on, Roger.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.840
Meanwhile, Trish
is off to start

29:01.840 --> 29:03.408
a whole new adventure.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.977
These are some
of the targets

29:04.977 --> 29:07.579
from your file
over the years.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.615
Take a gander.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.051
Well, that can't be.
Yeah.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.686
They're worse
than what you did yesterday.

29:14.686 --> 29:15.921
Way worse.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.523
You're a better shot now
than you were ten years ago.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.427
But everything's been off.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.662
You had a bad day.

29:23.662 --> 29:24.963
You're not a bad cop.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.099
The only thing I worry about
is your memory.

29:27.099 --> 29:30.902
So you're saying I can
still do the Roger?
Roger...

29:31.803 --> 29:33.572
You could never do the Roger.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.007
And this business
with the mullet?

29:35.007 --> 29:37.009
It's bad memory.
No, it was a mullet.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.478
No, it was not.
It used to get
in my mouth

29:39.478 --> 29:40.746
when you'd do this.

29:40.746 --> 29:43.382
That was my bangs.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.584
COLE: You will complete
every last bit of homework

29:45.584 --> 29:47.185
in addition to the
bonus assignments

29:47.185 --> 29:48.420
from your teachers.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.689
Suspension is
not a holiday.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.358
Sorry I got suspended.

29:53.358 --> 29:55.060
I was just really mad.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.895
Why?

29:56.895 --> 29:59.197
'Cause you gave up on Mom.

29:59.197 --> 30:01.833
You came back
so we could be a family,

30:01.833 --> 30:03.869
and now we can't.

30:03.869 --> 30:06.705
So, you're probably
gonna leave again, right?

30:08.740 --> 30:11.343
That's what
you're worried about?

30:11.343 --> 30:14.212
Well, why would you stay?

30:21.053 --> 30:23.255
I know that...

30:23.255 --> 30:24.723
I was gone for too long.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.228
But you were always on my mind.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.664
You, Maya.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.766
You are the reason
why I came back.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.235
You know
that, right?

30:37.235 --> 30:39.504
Yeah. I know.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.607
It's just...
sometimes I'm not sure.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.676
I know that I have
a lot to learn

30:44.676 --> 30:46.611
about being a dad.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.346
(chuckles) Like...

30:48.346 --> 30:50.549
not lying about plumbers,
for one thing.

30:50.549 --> 30:54.119
Yeah, that was pretty lame.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.122
You need to know that,

30:57.122 --> 31:00.692
no matter what else
I do in this world,

31:00.692 --> 31:03.929
I will never give up on you.

31:05.564 --> 31:09.968
So, now that we both agree
that this is all your fault,

31:09.968 --> 31:13.238
uh, does that still mean
I have to do all this homework?

31:13.238 --> 31:14.840
Nice try.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.683
Get to work.

31:30.489 --> 31:34.226
You're the cop
that picked up Frank?
That's right.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.094
Is everything okay?
I need your help.

31:36.094 --> 31:38.964
Frank's about to do
something really stupid.
