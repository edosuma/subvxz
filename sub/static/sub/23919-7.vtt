00:03.737 --> 00:05.239
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:05.273 --> 00:07.275
ANNOUNCER:
Archer: Danger Island.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.110
Premieres Wednesday, April 25,

00:09.143 --> 00:10.978
only on FXX.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.450
FX presents Atlanta.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.753
Hey, y'all.
So, tonight I'm wearing

00:19.787 --> 00:21.355
my new jasmine brandy lip plump.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.091
And y'all can use
a discount code to get it,

00:23.124 --> 00:26.327
so you can be-- mwah--
twinkling like your girl here.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.330
And what better way to bust it
out than a night with my girls?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.031
That's my girl Van.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.266
Say hi, Van.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.435
That's Van.

00:34.468 --> 00:38.106
She cute or whatever, and
I need a new Netflix password,

00:38.139 --> 00:39.373
so hook a girl up.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.541
All right, bye.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.642
No free pictures.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.212
Anyway, y'all stay tuned.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.414
'Cause tonight
the stars are gonna be out.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.218
I dropped this phone
in the tub with Lottie,

00:50.251 --> 00:52.553
and now it just does not
hold a charge.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.355
Uh-uh, no, we not talking
about Lottie,

00:54.388 --> 00:56.157
we not talking about children,
we talking about liquor,

00:56.190 --> 00:58.226
-we talking about...
-Liquor.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.627
-* Lick 'em and stick 'em *
-* Lick 'em *

00:59.660 --> 01:01.395
-* Stick 'em *
...
-Uh-uh.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.231
-* Stick 'em. *
-Tammi, you keep talking
like that,

01:03.264 --> 01:04.698
-you're gonna have
child number two tonight.
-Uh-uh.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.568
-She is.
-I got an IUD
to block them K-I-Ds.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.404
You know what, though?
Them IUDs work.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.173
NADINE:
You know what? Y'all nasty.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.407
'Cause I changed my shit up
after Lottie.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.608
You know what I'm saying?

01:16.277 --> 01:18.246
Don't get that copper IUD,

01:18.279 --> 01:19.580
-'cause that makes
your periods worse.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.249
-TAMMI: I'm good.
-VAN: Mm-hmm.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.417
What ever happened to condoms?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.153
Bitch, how old are you?

01:25.186 --> 01:26.520
-CANDICE: Really. Damn!

01:26.554 --> 01:27.588
Are you in high school?

01:29.690 --> 01:32.059
I don't have kids, and
I also don't have HPV, trick.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.495
TAMMI : Oh! Really,
y'all gonna play me like that?

01:34.528 --> 01:36.197
Put that in your condom
and fuck it.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.399
Oh, okay, so DJ said
that he's going to meet us

01:38.432 --> 01:39.567
and escort us through
and everything,

01:39.600 --> 01:40.768
so we don't look like groupies.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.236
-CANDICE: Mm.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.240
What is your deal
with DJ, actually?

01:46.274 --> 01:48.108
DJ, girl, that's--
he's a tour barber.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.643
-He's nothing.
-So, what,
you just stringing him along

01:49.677 --> 01:51.279
for an invite to Drake's party?

01:51.312 --> 01:54.248
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh, no,
I'm not stringing him along.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.450
I actually only talk
business with DJ.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.319
So, did you send him selfies?
Yes or no.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.422
I might've sent him one
or two selfies. Dang.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.158
So you sent him one or two
pictures of your breasts.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.194
First of all, my breasts
are already on Tumblr,

02:06.227 --> 02:07.561
so he could've already seen it.
And I only sent him

02:07.595 --> 02:09.263
-half a nipple--
that don't count.
-NADINE: Oh.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.764
Oh, okay, so he would've
saw them eventually,

02:10.798 --> 02:13.100
because I know you didn't
have on no business clothes.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.269
Everybody can't be a nun
like you, Nadine.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.271
If I'm gonna chase
anybody, y'all,

02:17.305 --> 02:19.607
it's gonna be that Aubrey. Uh!

02:19.640 --> 02:21.475
'Cause you know, I've always
had a crush on Aubrey.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.344
-TAMMI: Uh, you and all
the other groupies.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.878
-TAMMI:
What are you talking about?
-CANDICE: Aubrey.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.314
-You don't know him.
-TAMMI: Girl.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.617
-CANDICE: He is fine.
-Fine.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.419
CANDICE: And he looks like
he would make a great father.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.421
TAMMI: Van! Van,
do you hear this madness?

02:33.454 --> 02:35.256
-What are we--
what are y'all talking about?

02:35.289 --> 02:36.490
I don't even care;
I need a photo with Drake,

02:36.524 --> 02:38.326
because my Instagram
is weak as fuck.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.728
-I'm just being real. My shit--

02:40.761 --> 02:42.463
-look, I got Lottie,
Lottie, Lottie...
-Chicken.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.298
...Lottie, me-- chicken--

02:44.332 --> 02:45.766
I know exactly which one
you're talking about...

02:45.799 --> 02:47.635
-Uh-huh.
-...Lottie, Lottie, Earn.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.604
-Delete the Earn.
-Oh, yeah, so we can replace
Earn with Drake.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.644
-Y'all really think
this dress is okay?
-Mm-hmm.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.845
I think it looks good on you--
it's fine.

02:57.878 --> 02:58.912
Look, we got to go, okay?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.314
Let's have one more shot.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.315
NADINE: Do y'all think
I should smoke tonight?

03:01.349 --> 03:02.450
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes!

03:02.483 --> 03:03.917
Oh, my God!

03:05.386 --> 03:08.356
To partying with my girls.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.291
-And IUDs.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.861
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.896
("Never Created, Never
Destroyed" by Jlin playing)

03:26.407 --> 03:29.310
You are not a better driver
after a few drinks.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.844
-I'm a good driver.
-No, you ain't.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.381
-Um, Candice.
-Next time we smoke and drive.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.384
Candi, you sure
we in the right place?

03:36.417 --> 03:38.819
-Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.354
-There's nobody here.
-This looks a little sus.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.623
No, no, there's gonna be
a shuttle that comes.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.325
-I'm freezing.
-I'm losing my buzz.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.859
Where is everybody?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.828
-Okay, stop complaining.
-We're in the woods, girl.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.430
Follow me. Follow me.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.400
Thi-This way. Follow me.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.467
Where in the world?

03:53.501 --> 03:55.336
You should've wore pants.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.737
You should not be down here
in this...

03:56.770 --> 03:58.406
-Yo, uh, happy New Year.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.207
-Ha-Happy New Year.
-Right.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.875
Hey, y'all going to that
Drake theme party, right?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.311
I-I got this pizza for him.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.545
Like, right here.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.547
-Cool.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.915
Yo, give me the address,
y'all can have some,

04:07.948 --> 04:09.517
but this pizza has
to go inside him.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.918
-Oh, oh, the shuttle's
over here.
-He needs it.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.420
-This is good pizza.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.422
Hey, no, we don't want
your pizza. Bye.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.425
Wha... No, no,
you got to put me on, though.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.826
Put me on... I got music, too.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.394
Like, we could-we could
work just together.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.795
Put me on.
You... Come on, bruh!

04:21.829 --> 04:23.397
Don't leave me out.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.367
Don't leave me out...

04:26.400 --> 04:27.568
:
It's locked.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.737

for the party.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.912
-Ooh.
-Yes.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.414
Let's go see Drake.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.891
Damn.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.008
Hey, are you okay?

05:10.077 --> 05:12.580
I'm just so happy.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.483
Y'all pretty.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.585
I'm-a take y'all home with me.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.491
Just kidding.

please proceed
with your Ethiopian passport

and your costume.
-Okay.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.606
This is a residential home.

Keep booties on at all times.

-By the way, happy New Year.

Oh. Drake invited me.

WOMAN :
"Drake invited me."

That's his signature

WOMAN:
Can I just...

06:40.601 --> 06:41.969
No, you don't have to call him.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.571
I, um...

06:46.707 --> 06:48.542
I was supposed to be here,
not you!

06:48.576 --> 06:49.910
I was invited!

06:49.943 --> 06:52.846
I swear, I was invited!

-This is my song.
-This is my song.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.621
-Girl, every song is your song.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.826
Look at these Instagram

He's cute.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.203
TAMMI:
He would be with a white girl.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.841

are so cliché.

DJ, next time,
can you escort me?

07:28.616 --> 07:30.518
Because security
was so mean to me.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.119
-DJ: Oh, yeah, I got you.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.755
-Oh, yeah, I want to meet Drake.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.590
Uh, yeah, he's-he's floating
around somewhere.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.425
Well, where's this room?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.561
We want to go here.
-DJ: Uh...

07:40.594 --> 07:41.862
Okay, okay, well... Chill.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.597
No, no, it's-it's-it's cool.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.599
W-Well, I got to go DJ.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.601
'Cause my name is D-D-D-D-DJ.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.637
He's funny, right?

07:49.670 --> 07:50.938
-He's so...
-No.
-Get a drink,

07:50.971 --> 07:52.606
I'll hook y'all up.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.508
Oh. You want a gummy?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.509

-Oh, yes.

-Uh.

-Uh-uh, uh-uh. Uh...

07:59.513 --> 08:00.848
Mm-hmm, mm.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.616
She likes gummies.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.585
Take the gummy, enjoy yourself.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.520
-Fine.
-Mm-hmm.
-Come on.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.755
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.857
Well, ladies,
I'm gonna go with DJ.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.224
-Ah.
-So, y'all have fun.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.693
-DJ: Mm.
-It's a party, dance.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.961
Bye, Candi.

08:13.994 --> 08:14.962
Look at 'em.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.199
Mm-mmm.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.268
Chew.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.807
Very good.

* Way up, way up *

08:48.896 --> 08:52.032
* Same old thang *

08:52.065 --> 08:53.667
* Watch me do
the same old thang *

08:53.701 --> 08:55.002
* If I wrote your ass
a love song *

08:55.035 --> 08:56.704
* Could I make it bang? *

08:56.737 --> 08:58.005
* If I pull up
with my gun drawn... *

08:59.039 --> 09:00.674
I'm so sorry.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.543
It's okay.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.179
This edible ain't
kicking in fast enough

09:06.213 --> 09:08.749
for me to enjoy
this thot-a-thon.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.651
Amen.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.621
Where is Devyon Johnson?

09:13.654 --> 09:16.523
I just need to talk
some sense into him.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.592
Just so he knows, you know?

09:18.626 --> 09:20.594
I feel weird.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.029
I'm-a go find his ass.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.865
Damn, girl,
you look high as hell.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.569
Nadine, stay with Van.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.742
You seem annoyed or something.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.045
-No.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.548
He's out there living his life
and I'm here living mine.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.216
I'm just trying to get
this photo with Drake.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.118
I need to strategize.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.688
Is it me?
A

09:47.721 --> 09:49.957
What? No.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.925
You're paranoid.
Stop it.

09:51.959 --> 09:56.029
Ugh! I'm just going
through stuff,

09:56.063 --> 09:59.733
and this dress is just, like...

09:59.767 --> 10:01.702
I just need to calm down.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.304
I need to have a good time
and I'm just gonna relax.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.739
I'm gonna have a good time

10:05.773 --> 10:08.208
and I'm gonna have a vodka soda,
please.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.178
NADINE:
Yes. Is this the police?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.880
I-I need your help.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.883
I'm at this big party
at Drake's house and I'm dying.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.951
-I-I don't...

10:17.985 --> 10:19.052
-Help.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.754
Did she give you an address?

10:20.788 --> 10:22.255
No? Okay, bye.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.124
Honey, what's wrong with you?
You're just high.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.693
No, I'm dying and I know it.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.194
You are high
and you're paranoid.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.962
No, I need to go
to the hospital.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.764
No. We need to get out
of this room,

10:30.798 --> 10:31.765
but we are not leaving.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.668
Just take a sit
right here, okay?

10:34.702 --> 10:36.837
Why don't you lie down?
You want to lie down?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.271
NADINE:
I can't breathe right.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.807
Yes, you can. Come on.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.841
Let's lay you down. All right.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.677
Okay. Okay.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.379
We're gonna breathe together
like in yoga. Okay?

10:46.413 --> 10:49.282
-Shit.

10:49.316 --> 10:53.721
Um, okay, let's breathe.

10:53.754 --> 10:57.758
Okay?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.960
Okay. You keep doing that.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.394
Breathe. I see you breathing,
okay?

11:01.428 --> 11:02.830
I'm gonna get some water.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.665
Wait. DJ drugged me.

11:05.699 --> 11:06.900
No, no, no, no.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.902
We all ate the same thing. Okay?

11:08.936 --> 11:11.638
It's okay. Why don't you
lie down again, okay?

11:11.671 --> 11:15.008
Um, look, it's Drake.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.076
You can hang out with Drake,
okay?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.210
Why don't you stay with Drake?

11:17.244 --> 11:20.113
I'm
All right.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.120
-Oh, my God.
-Oh.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.856
-I'm so sorry.
-It-It's all good.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.157
-I mean, I...
-I'm sorry.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.691
I was all in the way.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.861
No, I'm sorry. I...

11:33.894 --> 11:36.363
Um, do you know
where I can find,

11:36.396 --> 11:39.900
like, a water or something
non-alcoholic or like...

11:39.933 --> 11:42.002
Voilà.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.906
Wow. Thank you.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.875
You got a bathroom in there,
too?

11:47.908 --> 11:49.176
I think I could help you out
with that.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.879
Oh, okay.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.681
Um... um...

11:56.016 --> 11:57.918
I'm Brandon, by the way.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.853
Oh, I'm Van.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.321
-It's-it's nice to meet you.
-Yeah, you, too.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.722
-Nice to meet you.
-Pretty smile.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.692
Thank you.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.929
Um... I got to go.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.197
My friend is kind of
freaking out.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.199
I needed to bring her
this water, so...

12:12.232 --> 12:14.134
I mean, is

12:14.167 --> 12:15.836
I mean, do you need some help?
I can-I can follow you.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.071
-Um, yeah, sure. Okay.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.773
Yeah. Um...

12:19.807 --> 12:21.208
she's pretty high, though, so...

12:21.241 --> 12:22.475
-I don't want you to...

12:22.509 --> 12:24.344
Sure she'll be all right
with that water.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.913
Where the hell did she go?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.915
BRANDON: Oh, was she here?
What she look like?

12:27.948 --> 12:30.784
Nadine! Shit.

12:32.986 --> 12:36.489
Shit. My phone is dead.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.826
-Nadine!
-Look, don't worry. I got you.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.460
I know a place downstairs
you can charge your phone

12:40.493 --> 12:42.896
next to a pretty dope bathroom.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.231
Yeah.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.933
-Oh, my God. Okay.
-No fear, no fear, no fear.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.367
-Thank you.
-I got you. I got you.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.936
She's gonna get us all arrested.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.137
Yeah, just right this way,
right down here.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.940
Okay.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.775
-BRANDON: Don't trip.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.847
That's a...
that's a really nice dress.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.982
-Yeah, of course.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.383
-Thank you.
-It's perfect.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.953
Wow, so this is,
like, his studio?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.288
-Yeah, it, uh, looks that way.
-Damn.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.024
Uh-huh.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.395
There's, uh, the power strip.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.898
Oh, thank you.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.901
So you, um, you work with Drake?

13:20.934 --> 13:22.903
Nah, uh,

13:22.936 --> 13:25.105
Drake's nutritionist
is my cousin.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.007
-Oh.
-Yeah, Coop.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.009
Oh, cool. Cool.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.979
But how'd you know about
his studio down here, then?

13:32.012 --> 13:35.382
No, you know... I just, uh...

13:35.415 --> 13:37.184
I got here at, like, 8:00,

13:37.217 --> 13:39.452
so I just walked around.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.989
Nobody was here, so...

13:42.022 --> 13:44.157
-Checked out the rooms.
-Uh-huh.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.927
-Saw what was in 'em.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.397
Friends? Nah.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.532
But you're my friend.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.939
Okay. Um...

13:58.972 --> 14:00.807
I need to use the bathroom.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.475
I'm gonna charge my phone
in there.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.511
Great. Let me just...
let me show you where it is.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.514
Okay.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.117
Here. Let-let me show you.
It's right over here.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.052
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.354
-Right here.
-Thank you.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.924
-Oh, I got it. Thank you.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.491
-Yeah. Thank you, though.
-All right. You're welcome.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.493
I-I-I'll just... I'll wait here.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.030
Ugh. Okay!

14:23.063 --> 14:24.431
BRANDON:
You good?

14:24.464 --> 14:27.200
Uh, yeah, I'm good.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.468
You need anything?

14:28.501 --> 14:31.071
VAN:
You know what? No.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.140
BRANDON:
Okay, some toilet paper or...?

14:33.173 --> 14:37.044
Uh, why don't you go get us
some weed?

14:37.077 --> 14:39.112
BRANDON:
Weed, right.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.381
Yeah, I can... I can,
I can find that.

14:41.414 --> 14:45.518
Um, yeah. Uh... are you...
are you hungry?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.120
You want any food while
I'm at it

14:50.090 --> 14:52.059
Maybe some water.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.860
Okay. All right.
I'll be right back.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.095
-Okay.
-Right back.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.096
VAN:
Take your time.

14:56.129 --> 14:59.399
Okay, just...

15:23.190 --> 15:25.092
Oh.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.893
*

15:26.926 --> 15:29.096
Drake?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.936
Hello?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.288
Smells nice.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.932
*

16:34.361 --> 16:37.964
Oh, my God.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.986
Is this real?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.323
DARIUS:
No.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.992
No, it is not.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.996
Hmm.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.165
Have you heard of
Bostrom's simulation argument?

17:12.199 --> 17:14.101
No.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.070
Basically, it just
states that, uh,

17:17.104 --> 17:20.773
future civilizations must have
immense computing power,

17:20.807 --> 17:23.376
and that if even
a fraction of this

17:23.410 --> 17:26.179
were to run
ancestral simulation,

17:26.213 --> 17:28.481
there's a high probability that
it would be indistinguishable

17:28.515 --> 17:31.184
from reality
to the simulated ancestor,

17:31.218 --> 17:32.719
i.e. us.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.188
What?

17:35.222 --> 17:37.290
You're a simulation.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.727
-Oh.
-Like a Sim.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.231
There is someone controlling
your every movement.

17:44.264 --> 17:48.168
Yeah, I don't even like apples.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.104
Can you help me stop thinking?

17:52.372 --> 17:54.374
:
Perhaps.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.278
Catch.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.720
Is she real?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.923
Real fake.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.761
I knew it.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.564
* Boy ain't slept in 40 days *

18:17.597 --> 18:19.199
* Rain, hail, sleet, snow *

18:19.232 --> 18:20.567
* Even when it's dark
or sunny, man *

18:20.600 --> 18:22.569
* I ain't got nothing left
to lose *

18:22.602 --> 18:24.504
* First time I seen
all I could gain *

18:24.537 --> 18:26.139
* So I beat the street,
just my feet *

18:26.173 --> 18:28.208
* Look how far I came *

18:28.241 --> 18:31.178
* Up from unpopular lame,
but now I'm a popular name *

18:31.211 --> 18:32.612
* See these niggas
ain't paid the cost *

18:32.645 --> 18:34.080
* We both rap, they awful,
I'm awe... *

19:40.680 --> 19:42.349
* Been on that
fuck-a-nigga shit *

19:42.382 --> 19:44.384
* Take a nigga bitch and then
I pass her to the clique *

19:44.417 --> 19:46.386
* I say, see me, I don't got
no time for no bitch *

19:46.419 --> 19:47.787
* I just get 'em for the bros *

19:47.820 --> 19:49.522
* I'm just worried
'bout them chips *

19:49.556 --> 19:51.324
* I'm a shot call,
little nigga *

19:51.358 --> 19:53.426
* I'm-a stay wild, hot nigga *

19:53.460 --> 19:55.328
* I belong in a dog pound *

19:55.362 --> 19:58.398
* Shot call, little nigga,
I'm-a stay wild... *

19:58.431 --> 20:02.335
Yeah, I'm staring at you. Ho.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.305
Is there a problem?

20:05.338 --> 20:07.240
Not really!

20:07.274 --> 20:09.842
You're saddled over there
with your black man accessory,

20:09.876 --> 20:13.646
and I'm just tired
of that story, to be honest.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.881
It's basic.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.485
But that's just me, personally.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.487
Okay.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.921
* Stop it, niggas knowin'... *

20:21.954 --> 20:24.724
Maybe I'm just a good woman.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.493
Huh?!

20:26.526 --> 20:29.362
Like, a good girlfriend?

20:29.396 --> 20:33.366
Maybe I add value to his life?

20:33.400 --> 20:36.269
I've been with him since
he was doing community theater.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.805
I cooked. I cleaned.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.573
I've had his back
from the very beginning.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.576
I've always supported him.

20:43.610 --> 20:47.280
Maybe two good people
found each other,

20:47.314 --> 20:50.383
and I'm a good woman
who found a good man.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.252
* I say, see me, I don't got
no time for no bitch... *

20:53.286 --> 20:54.721
Bitch, don't even act
like you don't know

20:54.754 --> 20:56.423
what's going on out here!

20:56.456 --> 20:58.858
You got all the advantages
in the world to be a good woman.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.593
You can afford to invest early.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.462
I ain't got time
to be sitting out here

21:02.495 --> 21:04.431
with no community-theater-ass
nigga for eight years

21:04.464 --> 21:06.599
and wishing on a goddamn star.
Uh-uh.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.868
There are plenty, plenty,
plenty, plenty

21:08.901 --> 21:11.704
of good, black women,
but you don't see Brad Pitt

21:11.738 --> 21:14.407
trying to date Shonda Rhimes.
No!

21:14.441 --> 21:17.444
No. No. Type "beautiful woman"

21:17.477 --> 21:18.878
in Google Images, honey.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.847
Then you can talk to me.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.450
* I'm a shot call, little nigga,
I'm-a stay wild... *

21:23.483 --> 21:25.284
I just love Devyon.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.019
Bitch, I love him, too!

21:27.053 --> 21:29.322
* Little nigga,
I'm-a stay wild *

21:29.356 --> 21:31.324
* Hot nigga,
I belong in a dog pound... *

21:31.358 --> 21:34.961
Okay, um, thank you.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.596
* That's a no-no *

21:36.629 --> 21:38.965
* Off tops, new chain,
and my wrist froze *

21:38.998 --> 21:41.401
* Loaded up, still bouncin'
with that .44... *

21:41.434 --> 21:44.270
Sorry.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.639
* Never give a bitch yo' phone,
that's a no-no *

21:46.673 --> 21:49.141
* Off tops, new chain,
and my wrist froze. *

21:59.486 --> 22:01.888
Hi?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.965
:
Hi. I'm sorry.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.969
Um... I'm lost.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.971
-I need to get to the party.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.007
Um, or to the main part
of the house.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.445
With Drake?

22:25.478 --> 22:28.548
Drake.
Drake no está.

22:31.584 --> 22:35.922
Oh. Um...

22:35.955 --> 22:39.592
-I don't really, um...

22:39.626 --> 22:41.694
¿El avión?

22:41.728 --> 22:43.329
Yo soy su abuelo.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.665
Are you Drake's abuelo?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.500
Sí. Abuelo.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.502
Oh, my God. You're his grandpa.

22:49.536 --> 22:52.371
Sí. Abuelo.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.874
No. Mm-mm.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.510
I don't speak Spanish.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.580
No hablas español.
But it's nice to meet you.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.755
You want me to look at that?

23:14.561 --> 23:16.596
Hold up.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.431
Drake's not here?

23:26.573 --> 23:30.477
WOMAN: Yeah, you got to get low
in front and high.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.379
Hey, how you doing? How you
doing? Hey. $20. All right.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.081
Look, we got this right here.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.517
Drake bowtie. Straight off
the tux from the Oscars.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.619
-Get low.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.053
What the fuck is going on
in here?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.489
Oh, how you doing?

23:42.522 --> 23:43.923
We got $20 per selfie.

23:43.956 --> 23:47.460
-It'll get you 10,000 followers,
guaranteed.
-Mm-hmm.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.928
The line starts there, sweetie.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.033
Hold up. You're telling me
all these girls

23:54.066 --> 23:56.569
have been posting fake photos
on Instagram all night?

23:56.603 --> 23:58.571
Look, they're real
to everyone else.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.973
I mean, this your best option,
anyway.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.442
You thought you was gonna have
a meaningful convo with Drake

24:03.476 --> 24:05.077
-You was gonna come
to the party,

24:05.111 --> 24:07.580
ask for a pic and post it
on the Gram,

24:07.614 --> 24:09.048
so here you go.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.183
-You're welcome.
-$20.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.019
Line's right there.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.588
Or $30, hold on.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.591
And you get these
free Puma slides.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.992
What's up?

24:20.026 --> 24:21.427
What you want to do?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.870
-Girl, she ain't real.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.606
-Hey.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.143
Stars are just a projection
of what's actually already

24:37.176 --> 24:39.445
-inside of your mind.
-Drake.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.716
Darius?

24:43.750 --> 24:46.653
DARIUS:
Oh, hey, Van.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.154
Why are you here?

24:48.187 --> 24:51.457
Oh, actually, we were
just talking about that.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.660
It's basically, really just...

24:53.693 --> 24:55.662
No, I meant the party.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.564
Is Earn with you?

24:57.597 --> 24:58.698
No.

24:58.731 --> 25:02.635
But I know Drake's chef,
Guillermo,

25:02.669 --> 25:04.470
from the glorious days
of pick-up soccer.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.606
But how did we get here?

25:06.639 --> 25:09.642
Oh, see, that's
an even harder one, actually.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.510
-It all start...
-VAN: No, shut up.

25:11.544 --> 25:14.781
Candice drove us here.

25:14.814 --> 25:19.251
And then she ditched us
for T-Pain's party.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.488
That sucks.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.957
You okay?

25:26.993 --> 25:29.095
I think so.

25:29.128 --> 25:32.665
Me and Darius figured out
that I am nothing.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.500
We're all nothing.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.035
It's a simulation, Van.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.707
It's all fake.

25:40.740 --> 25:44.644
You're right.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.078
It's all fake.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.815
There's no Drake.

25:48.848 --> 25:52.251
So don't ruin your high
and just enjoy yourself.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.654
Hmm.

25:54.687 --> 25:57.523
You're such a good friend.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.828
TAMMI:
Hey. Hey.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.697
Hey, y'all.
They kicking everybody out.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.766
And, Van, what the hell
do you got on?

26:06.799 --> 26:09.769
Come on, y'all.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.571
NADINE:
How are we getting home?

26:30.757 --> 26:33.660

You're nuts, kiddo.

You're--

28:21.167 --> 28:23.369
A danger no one
is ready for.

28:23.402 --> 28:24.937
The real me.
