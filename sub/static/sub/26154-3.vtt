00:09.009 --> 00:10.760
I think, the most important thing here

00:10.844 --> 00:14.139
is that we're honest with each other
and ourselves. Do you agree?

00:14.222 --> 00:15.348
Uh, yes?

00:15.432 --> 00:18.226
It says, here, you failed
your last six health inspections.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.728
-Ooh.
-How are you still in business?

But possibly spunk.

-It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.m.

Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a habit
of spending the night or day.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.868
I get it. We work together,
we make sex together,

00:34.951 --> 00:36.161
we don't talk about feelings,

00:36.244 --> 00:39.122

a begrudging respect can blossom into--

00:39.205 --> 00:40.665
-Nope.
-"Blossoms into nothing"

00:40.749 --> 00:41.833

00:41.916 --> 00:43.918
You cut me off, so you look stupid.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.630
Well, you look stupid when you sleep.
Look, I took some dumb pictures.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.424
-[BoJack] All right.
-Stupid. Real stupid.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.509
-[BoJack] You can delete some.
-You have a weird eye.

-Hi, excuse me, can I get  The BoJack?
-What is that?

00:57.640 --> 01:00.435
It's an off-the-menu item
for those in the know.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.730
Obviously, I'm BoJack
and I always order the BoJack sandwich.

01:03.813 --> 01:04.689
That's kooky.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.983
Why would your name be a sandwich name?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.569
Because I own this restaurant
and I'm a celebrity.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.947
So, are all sandwiches named
after celebrities?

01:13.031 --> 01:14.657
Is chicken salad a celebrity?

01:14.741 --> 01:17.035
No, that's just a thing
they put in the sandwich.

01:17.118 --> 01:18.328

And if I had to guess,
I'd say neither are you.

Guys in this town, especially celebrities,
are not exactly the settle-down type.

01:44.187 --> 01:47.398
That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy.
He doesn't have a problem committing.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.652
In fact,
he just got out of his third marriage.

01:50.735 --> 01:54.823

Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.744
I don't know you or your relationship,

a few times.

I was even on an ABC procedural,
called  The Block,  which aired a few times.

02:04.833 --> 02:09.546
The key is to have zero expectations,
and then you'll never be disappointed.

Hmm.

Yeah, zero expectations,

getting to sing on Broadway.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.397
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.

10:06.772 --> 10:10.234
So now I get steady TV work,
which is fine, and I'm fine,

10:10.318 --> 10:12.194
but I still listen to that musical

10:12.278 --> 10:14.780
because it reminds me of a time
when I was less jaded,

10:14.905 --> 10:18.576
when I believed I could do anything,
and that makes me feel good.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.328
Oh, my God, Gina.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.331
I-I didn't realize how much
this musical meant to you.

10:23.998 --> 10:27.168
-And that... that's even funnier!
-Oh!

10:27.251 --> 10:28.377
[laughs] Oh, come on!

10:28.461 --> 10:31.464
You know if this were reversed,
you'd be giving me shit.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.632
Ugh!

10:32.715 --> 10:36.344
Hey, Gina, I'm sorry. I was just teasing.
I was... It was... [sighs]

10:36.427 --> 10:38.471
Gina, come out of the bathroom.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.390
Gina? Oh, right.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.688
[Laika]  So, he make for you
room, that you always have dream of,

10:47.772 --> 10:49.982
and this is why you leave?
Seems like overreaction.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.442
[laughs] Oh, thank you!

10:51.525 --> 10:53.611
[Diane]  Okay, we're gonna take a break.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.196
I'm getting kinda hungry.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.823
We could stop at a restaurant,
but that's kind of a date thing.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.160
Well, fast food doesn't count, right?

11:01.243 --> 11:03.371
-Look, there's a KFC at the next exit.
-Perfect.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.997
[piano music playing]

11:05.081 --> 11:08.584
Welcome to KFC,
which stands for Kiki's French Cuisine.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.627
-Hon hon hon!
-[gasps]

11:10.127 --> 11:11.379
[both] Oh.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.386
I'm not sure I want to wear the pajamas
your dad gave me.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.304
I'm sorry you have to deal with all this.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.849
Is it just me
or was your sister flirting with me?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.893
Ugh, when we were in high school,

11:25.976 --> 11:28.104
I was still trying to figure out
my sexuality,

11:28.187 --> 11:31.732
so, I dressed as Mindy,
and tried to seduce her boyfriend.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.235
-Hmm.
-I quickly realized I wasn't into it,

11:34.318 --> 11:36.487
but Mindy found out,
and now that I have a boyfriend,

11:36.570 --> 11:40.241
she probably wants to have sex with you
to get revenge. Typical sister stuff.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.243
I thought sisters were doing it
for themselves.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.161
I mean, what does she need me for?

11:44.245 --> 11:45.162
-[knocking]
-Todd,

11:45.246 --> 11:48.207
can you help me move some furniture?
My husband has a hernia.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.376
Yeah, no, I noticed in the marzipan.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.713
So, what, uh,
furniture do you want me to--

11:53.796 --> 11:55.381
-[sighs]
-Oh, no! Your garment fell.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.341
This must be so embarrassing for you.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.719
Just as I suspected.
You're not sexual at all.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.011
Like, heck I'm not.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.472
Any ordinary man would be madly aroused

12:03.556 --> 12:07.143
by the body that starred in every single
porn version of a John Hughes movie:

12:07.226 --> 12:10.438
Sixteen Cans, Titty in Pink,
The Breakfast Chub, Homo Bone...

12:10.521 --> 12:12.773
-I gotta go.
-Cum Kind of Wonderful,

12:18.696 --> 12:20.197
When the cock crows midnight,

12:20.281 --> 12:23.075
meet me under the old willow tree
in the backyard for sex.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.244
-Zoinks!
-[laughs]

12:25.327 --> 12:26.370
[panting]

12:27.705 --> 12:28.748
Okay, quick update.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.542
Mindy wants to meet me
for backyard sex at midnight,

12:31.625 --> 12:33.085
and your mother knows I'm asexual.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.378
She showed me her boobs.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.380
Please tell me you said, "Ahh-ooga!"

12:36.464 --> 12:37.339
Oh, I didn't!

12:37.423 --> 12:41.093
Oh, no! She'll disown me!
We gotta convince her you're super horny.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.137
-How?
-If Mindy told my mom

12:43.220 --> 12:46.307
that you made a pass at her,
that would prove you're not asexual.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.143
Here's the plan.
We'll wait until the cock crows midnight.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.311
Who is this cock?

12:50.394 --> 12:51.437
When she's at the backyard,

12:51.520 --> 12:53.230
I'll sneak in her room
and wear her clothes.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.775
I'll pretend I'm Mindy
and tell my mother you made a pass at me.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.985
Okay, this sounds a little complicated,

12:58.068 --> 13:01.489
but I think I can handle
exactly this amount of complication

13:01.572 --> 13:05.117
as long as things don't become
one bit more complicated.

13:07.244 --> 13:10.748
-[musical playing over earbuds]
-Hey, I'm sorry I made fun of your dream.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.917
[sighs] It's okay.
Just don't tell anyone about it.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.669
Good news; too late.
I talked to Flip and Princess Carolyn

13:15.753 --> 13:17.421
about how you're
into this Broadway crap...

13:17.505 --> 13:19.131
-What?
-...and they said maybe you can sing

13:19.215 --> 13:20.925
in the nightclub episode.
Can you believe it?

13:21.008 --> 13:23.511
-Oh, my God.
-It's your big break, and I helped!

13:23.594 --> 13:25.137
I don't want help.
Why would you do that?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.056
I know you don't want me
doing nice things

13:27.139 --> 13:30.309
because I'm not your boyfriend,
and you're a sentient wall of spikes,

13:30.518 --> 13:33.103
but they want to hear you sing
at the next break.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.021
Here's a song!

13:34.104 --> 13:35.272
♪ Hell, no! ♪

13:35.356 --> 13:37.066
Gina, this is your dream,

13:37.149 --> 13:39.193
and there's nothing more precious
than dreams.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.653
It doesn't work that way.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.531
You're used to being the star,
so good things always happen to you.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.657
I'm not the star.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.076
I'm the third on the call sheet
for  Murder Hospital,

13:47.159 --> 13:48.786
or  Who Called the Monkey Paramedics.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.704
And maybe if I'm lucky, when I'm 60,

13:50.788 --> 13:53.082
I can get a   juicy season arc
on the right cable show

13:53.165 --> 13:55.251
where everyone goes,
"Who's this 60-year-old woman?

13:55.334 --> 13:57.711
She came out of nowhere."
Then I win an Emmy in a movie

13:57.795 --> 13:59.255
where I play Benjamin Bratt's mother.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.466
Gina, I know, but what I'm saying is,
what if you are the star?

14:02.550 --> 14:04.260
-I'm not.
-But what if you are?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.555
If you don't try, you'll never know.
You'll spend the rest of your life

14:07.638 --> 14:09.765
wondering if you could have made it
or not.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.769
Is that what you want?
Always the Bratt's mom and never Da Brat?

14:14.186 --> 14:15.020
[scoffs]

14:16.605 --> 14:17.439
Okay.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.732
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.527
-Just... so I don't have to wonder, right?
-Exactly.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.155
I'm gonna go get ready.
This is dumb, but thank you, BoJack.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.960
You know, this is actually really freeing.

14:38.043 --> 14:41.005
I feel like, I can say all the things
I would never say on a date.

14:41.088 --> 14:44.383
Like that I've never seen  The Wire,
and I don't think I'm gonna.

14:44.466 --> 14:47.011
Well, I'd never tell a date
that I get the  New York Times,

14:47.094 --> 14:49.388
but I only read the style section
and throw the rest away.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.973
I don't have or want children,

14:51.056 --> 14:54.184
but I silently judge every parent
that I see in public.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.228
I sleep with a chew toy,
since I was a kid.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.814
[chuckles]
I still have feelings for Diannnne.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.693
Oh. That's much less fun
than the other things.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.403
Uh, listen--

Ah! Mrs. Buenaventura!

15:30.304 --> 15:32.473
I was trying to understand
how someone could be like you,

15:32.556 --> 15:33.766
so I did a little research.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.143
Did you know a computer can do more
than just find porn?

15:36.226 --> 15:38.687
I use my laptop to flatten pie dough.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.607
This concept of asexuality intrigues me.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.818
I've grown tired of the whole world
thinking of me as a sex object.

15:44.902 --> 15:48.238
For once in my life I would like to have
a close, intimate experience

15:48.322 --> 15:50.282

Mom, are you there? It's me, Mindy.

You can tell
because I'm dressed like a slut, as usual.

16:13.514 --> 16:17.977
Mindy, come down here.
I have a question only you can answer.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.436
Oh, okay.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.275
If you really want to be asexual,

16:25.359 --> 16:28.404
first, you have to put on
every piece of clothing you own.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.240
That's how we make sure
we don't look sexy.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.326
So, leave me and go do that.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.496
Very well, but I'll be back
to not have sex with you.

What? No.

Surely it's erect since you've been
just having sex with my daughter,

so unless you've been deceiving me,
this whole time, in my own home,

18:29.942 --> 18:33.153
there's no logical reason, for you,
not to whip out your erect penis

18:33.237 --> 18:35.197

Okay, so, it's 1712,

19:04.768 --> 19:07.980
and American colonist Sybilla Masters
is perfecting her invention.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.649
Can we lose the liner notes
and get to the singing?

19:10.732 --> 19:13.902
I'm a producer. I can't just sit around
having conversations, all day.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.489
Oh, yeah, sorry. Of course.

[clears throat] I'm sorry.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.221
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
That was weird.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.097
You know what, she was nervous, and--

20:24.181 --> 20:26.934
BoJack, I don't know what kind
of power games you two are playing,

20:27.017 --> 20:28.227
but keep it in the bedroom.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.395
That was just mean, to her and to us.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.065
No. I thought she'd be good.
I was trying to do a nice thing.

20:33.148 --> 20:36.360
And I would like to be judged solely
on my intentions this time.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.154
[both grunting]

20:39.238 --> 20:40.239
[both shouting]

20:40.614 --> 20:43.492
Interloper!
You ruined our family heirloom.

20:43.575 --> 20:47.162
Ah! I'm sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...

20:51.375 --> 20:54.002
-[both grunting]
-That's for trying to trick Todd

20:54.086 --> 20:55.128
into having sex with you!

20:55.212 --> 20:58.507
And that's for having sex
with my boyfriend in high school!

20:58.590 --> 20:59.967
I never had sex with him!

21:00.050 --> 21:02.594
Yes, you did!
The whole school knew about it.

21:02.803 --> 21:03.679
No, I didn't.

21:03.762 --> 21:08.016
I was going to, but I ran away
because I'm [shouting] asexuaaaaaaaaal!

21:08.100 --> 21:09.393
[gasping]

21:12.354 --> 21:14.314
You know,
it felt good to finally tell them.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.316
I was surprised
how cool they were with it.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.568
Yeah, I kind of forgot
that despite our differences,

21:18.652 --> 21:19.945
they're family and they love me.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.407
So, I guess all that sneaking around
was completely pointless.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.784
Hey, you're right!
What a silly waste of time.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.664
-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Of course.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.375
Why did you tell your family
I went to college?

21:33.458 --> 21:36.670
Oh, I don't know, I guess
I just wanted you to seem impressive.

21:36.753 --> 21:41.550
-Impressive to who?
-Todd... [sighs] To whom.

21:41.842 --> 21:42.884
[sighs]

21:42.968 --> 21:45.846
-Yolanda, we need to break up.
-What?

21:45.929 --> 21:49.099
The only thing we have in common
is that we're asexual.

21:49.182 --> 21:53.979
I'm sure there's a guy out there for you,
whom's smart and accomplished

21:54.062 --> 21:56.857
-and whom went to college--
-And also doesn't want to have sex?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.443
Yeah. Probably.

22:00.068 --> 22:04.364
-But what if there isn't?
-Well, then let's make a deal.

22:04.448 --> 22:08.577
How about if neither of us meet
anybody else by the time we're a hundred,

22:08.660 --> 22:09.953
we give this another shot?

22:10.037 --> 22:13.248
When we're a hundred? I don't know.
Are you gonna steal my dentures

22:13.332 --> 22:15.709
and use them to build
some sort of motorized nutcracker,

22:15.876 --> 22:17.919
but then the nutcracker's AI
becomes self-aware

22:18.003 --> 22:21.048
and leads all the other dentures
in the nursing home in a toothy revolt?

22:21.131 --> 22:25.177
-I wanna say no, but probably yes.
-[sighs]

22:25.260 --> 22:28.263
Well, then, I guess I'll see you
when we're a hundred.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.349
[soft, calm music playing]

22:31.641 --> 22:34.019
-[Pickles shivers]
-Come on, you're shivering.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.813
-Please, just take the blanket.
-No, I'm okay.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.108
Are you the type of war dramatized
in  The Hunt for Red October?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.651
Because you're cold.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.488
That one doesn't even make sense.
How do you hunt a month?

22:44.571 --> 22:47.407
I know that it was really hard
to hear what I said in the restaurant,

22:47.491 --> 22:50.952
but... I want you to know
everything about me,

22:51.036 --> 22:52.079
even the hard stuff.

22:52.162 --> 22:55.332
I get it. This is a bad time for you
to start a relationship.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.209
[laughs] Of course it's a bad time!

22:57.292 --> 22:58.919
I just signed divorce papers.

22:59.002 --> 23:01.046
But I can't control
when I meet someone special.

23:01.129 --> 23:04.758
So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend
I don't want to see you every night?

23:04.841 --> 23:06.885
But what if I'm like the space station?

23:06.968 --> 23:10.055
After a while, you get bored of me
and replace me with someone new.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.640
Look, I don't know the future.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.642
This could end in heartbreak
for both of us.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.352
I mean, most relationships do.

23:15.435 --> 23:18.563
And if I'm honest,
it's not usually me that gets bored.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.566
But I'd like to see where it goes
because... I like you.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.151
[chuckles] And we have fun together.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.196
And every time we see each other,
I like you a little more.

23:26.279 --> 23:31.827
Hmm. Hey, am I Taylor Swift's grudge
against Katy Perry, right now?

23:31.910 --> 23:36.123
Because even though it makes no sense,
I want to be held for a superlong time.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.000
-[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles] Mmm.
-Mmm.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.978
-Hey, Gina.
-Hi.

23:58.061 --> 24:00.188
[stammers] Look, I'm sorry.
I thought--

24:00.272 --> 24:02.774
Hey, from now on,
let's just stick to the original rules

24:02.858 --> 24:05.193
-and not get in each other's business.
-Yes, of course.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.113
-[stammers] I'm sorry. I didn't even--
-For the record, you were right.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.782
If I didn't sing there,
I would have spent the rest of my life

24:10.866 --> 24:12.826
not knowing
if I ever could have made it or not.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.494
Now I know. So, good.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.955
You had a bad audition.
It doesn't mean that everything--

24:17.038 --> 24:18.039
I said it's fine.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.376
You did your good deed,
so, you can feel good about yourself.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.670
-Hmm.
-I'm going to bed.

24:24.087 --> 24:27.507
If you want to have sex with me, you can.
Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.

24:27.591 --> 24:31.428
O-Okay. Uh... Hmm.
