WEBVTT

00:03.470 --> 00:04.571

<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.604 --> 00:05.572
- YES!

00:05.605 --> 00:06.706
BIDDING WAR, BITCHES.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.375
- YOU GOT MORE THAN
THE ASKING PRICE.

00:08.408 --> 00:09.676
- AND IT'S ALL YOURS.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.445
- WOW.
I WANT THIS LISTING,

00:12.479 --> 00:14.114
AND I WILL
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET IT.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.648
- THIS ONE'S SOLD.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.050
- LET ME SHOW
YOU THE APARTMENT.

00:17.083 --> 00:19.719
- HOLY...
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

00:19.753 --> 00:20.987
- WE HAVE A BEST AND FINAL,

00:21.021 --> 00:25.425
11 MILLION AND
ALL THE FURNITURE FOR 250,000.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.994
- ALL RIGHT.
- WIN, WIN, WIN.

00:31.798 --> 00:36.469
- MY MOTTO IS
EXPANSION ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:36.503 --> 00:39.305
- NEW YORK CITY IS THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:39.339 --> 00:40.907
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.176
- I'M THE CLOSER,
AND THE LISTING MACHINE.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.712
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:45.745 --> 00:46.846
WAH!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.348
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.
- REACH HIGH.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.649
- CAN YOU TAKE THIS GUY
OUT OF HERE?

00:49.683 --> 00:51.117
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP ME.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.619
- WHAT?
- YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.932
- FERNANDO, WILL YOU TAKE ME
TO THE APTHORP?

01:05.965 --> 01:07.701
- OKAY. WE SHOULD BE THERE
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.169
- AWESOME.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.738
SELLING MY LISTING AT THE
APTHORP ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE

01:11.771 --> 01:14.074
WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
CHALLENGE OF MY ENTIRE CAREER.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.309
- ALL RIGHT.
[inaudible]

01:16.343 --> 01:18.111
- YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.380
- BUT I SOLD IT
AT A RECORD PRICE.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.949
- CHEERS.
- 8.8 MILLION ALL CASH.

01:22.982 --> 01:27.153
AND NOW, HE'S INVITED ME TO
TALK ABOUT FUTURE BUSINESS.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.757
HELLO?
ARI?

01:30.790 --> 01:32.792
- YEAH?
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

01:32.826 --> 01:36.229
SO I BROUGHT SOMETHING
SPECIAL TO SWEETEN UP THE DEAL

01:36.262 --> 01:38.331
THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY
BE DOING TOGETHER.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.567
SOME PIE.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.102
- WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING ME
CUPCAKES?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.303
- UM...

01:43.336 --> 01:46.573
OH, ARI.
NOTHING EVER PLEASES ARI.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.241
WOW, IT'S GRAND.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.342
- YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
THIS PLACE BEFORE?

01:49.376 --> 01:50.877
- NO.
IS IT BIGGER?

01:50.910 --> 01:53.179
IT LOOKS HUGE ALL THE WAY
DOWN THERE AND BOTH--

01:53.213 --> 01:55.215
- TWO FLOORS AS WELL.

01:55.248 --> 01:58.251
THIS APARTMENT
IS YOUR NEXT LISTING.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.290
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.826
- THIS ROOM IS--
- THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN 2F.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.596
OH, OH, OH!
GOOSEBUMPS.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.132
- YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.
- BUT GOOD.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.734
AT A LITTLE OVER 4,200
SQUARE FEET

02:14.768 --> 02:16.903
THIS PLACE IS SLIGHTLY
BIGGER THAN 2F,

02:16.936 --> 02:19.472
AND ON A HIGHER FLOOR,

02:19.506 --> 02:21.841
WHICH MEANS A HIGHER
COMMISSION FOR ME!

02:26.846 --> 02:28.581
- SO THIS IS
THE MASTER BATHROOM.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.251
- [exhales dramatically]

02:31.284 --> 02:34.087
OKAY, GOOSEBUMPS GONE.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.656
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT IS THAT COLOR.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.725
I THINK THE PRICE
JUST WENT DOWN.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.927
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
- NO ONE LIKES IT.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.463
MY GRANDMOTHER
DOESN'T EVEN LIKE IT.

02:45.165 --> 02:49.336
WHAT?
WHAT IS THIS?

02:49.369 --> 02:50.837
FOUR DIFFERENT KIND
OF CABINETRY?

02:50.870 --> 02:52.539
- RELAX.
WHOEVER BUYS THIS APARTMENT

02:52.572 --> 02:56.943
CAN FINISH IT IN WHICHEVER
WAY THEY LIKE.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.412
- RIGHT, OKAY.

02:59.446 --> 03:00.747
AHH.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.749
ALL THE BATHROOMS ARE HIDEOUS.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.084
[groans]

03:05.819 --> 03:07.387
OOH, THOSE BATHROOMS.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.625
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

03:12.659 --> 03:16.363
THIS IS A LITTLE LARGER,
A LITTLE HIGHER UP,

03:16.396 --> 03:18.098
HAS A DOWNSTAIRS,
WHICH IS GREAT.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.067
BUT THOSE BATHROOMS
AND THAT STRANGE KITCHEN

03:21.067 --> 03:22.635
IS BRINGING THE PRICE DOWN.

03:22.669 --> 03:24.804
PEOPLE IN THE
$10 MILLION RANGE,

03:24.838 --> 03:26.072
THEY WANT TO OPEN THE
DOOR TO THE BATHROOM

03:26.072 --> 03:27.474
AND SEE PERFECTION.

03:27.507 --> 03:32.412
- SO LET'S DO 10.2, 10.25.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.747
- NO.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.648
I WOULD SAY 9.5 FOR THIS.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.984
REMEMBER, LAST I TOLD
YOU 9, WE ENDED UP AT 8.8.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.720
SO I WAS VERY CLOSE.
- FINE.

03:40.754 --> 03:45.458
SO, WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE WILL
INCLUDE KITCHEN RENOVATION

03:45.492 --> 03:47.127
AND RENOVATIONS ON BATHROOMS.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.294
HOW'S THAT?
- OKAY, I LIKE THAT.

03:48.328 --> 03:51.564
- 10 MILLION.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.999
- NO.

03:53.099 --> 03:54.300
TAD BELOW.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.935
- WHY?
- PSYCHOLOGY.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.938
9.9, BEST AND FINAL.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.807
SOME MORE PIE?

04:00.840 --> 04:02.142
- [sighs]

04:02.175 --> 04:03.410
HOW MANY TIMES
AM I GONNA DO THAT?

04:03.443 --> 04:05.045
[sighs]

04:05.078 --> 04:06.246
- YOU WON'T DO IT
AT THE CLOSING.

04:06.279 --> 04:07.447
THAT'S FOR SURE.
- RIGHT, THAT'S TRUE.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.050
- IT'S GONNA MORE
LIKE--LIKE [gasps].

04:13.720 --> 04:18.124
- OKAY, 9.9 INCLUDING
RENOVATIONS ON BATHROOMS

04:18.158 --> 04:21.528
AND KITCHEN AND NOTHING MORE.
- LET'S DO THIS.

04:21.561 --> 04:23.063
I'M SO EXCITED TO GET
THIS LISTING BECAUSE,

04:23.063 --> 04:25.732
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST
ONE, I PROVED MYSELF, YES.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.067
BUT IT'S REALLY THE SECOND TIME

04:27.067 --> 04:29.903
WHEN YOU CEMENT A RELATIONSHIP
WITH SOMEONE NEW,

04:29.936 --> 04:32.105
AND HE WILL USE ME FOREVER.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.249
- OLIVIA.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.652
- YEAH?

04:45.685 --> 04:47.487
- NO.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.823
- EMILIA AND I HAVE HIT A ROCKY
PATCH IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.124
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.392
ALL I CAN HEAR IS, LIKE, YOU,
YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU,

04:52.425 --> 04:54.694
AND I HAVE SO MUCH OTHER STUFF
TO DO. HOLD ON.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.964
- DAMN IT.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.400
- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A
HOLD OF HER TO WORK THINGS OUT,

05:00.433 --> 05:01.735
BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
I HAVE TO GO OUT OF TOWN

05:01.768 --> 05:03.436
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.205
- WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT L.A. PROPERTIES?

05:05.238 --> 05:08.041
- BECAUSE I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH LIGHT,

05:08.041 --> 05:09.376
AND HE'S IN LOS ANGELES
AND HE WANTS TO BUY A HOUSE.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.411
AND HE FOUND A HOUSE
THAT HE REALLY LIKES,

05:11.444 --> 05:14.381
AND HE WANTS TO FLY ME OUT THERE
IN HIS PRIVATE JET

05:14.414 --> 05:17.317
TOMORROW AND HAVE ME
NEGOTIATE IT.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.353
LIGHT IS A LONGTIME CLIENT
OF MINE,

05:20.387 --> 05:22.222
AND HE'S NOW MOVED
TO LOS ANGELES

05:22.255 --> 05:24.891
AND IS LOOKING TO BUY
A BACHELOR PAD.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.426
I NEED YOU TO COMP OUT
EVERYTHING SO I CAN READ

05:26.459 --> 05:29.062
THROUGH IT ON THE PLANE. I'M NOT
GONNA HAVE ANY TIME BEFORE THEN.

05:29.062 --> 05:33.933
BUT THE TIMING'S NOT GREAT,
NOT TO MENTION I DON'T LIKE L.A.

05:33.967 --> 05:37.137
- BUT YOU NEED TO GET READY.
- AND WHAT ELSE DO I NEED?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.372
I NEED, LIKE, TWO SUITS 'CAUSE
I'LL WEAR ONE SUIT THERE...

05:39.406 --> 05:40.373
- SUNSCREEN.
- AND ONE SUIT THERE.

05:40.407 --> 05:41.441
SUNSCREEN?

05:41.474 --> 05:44.444
- YEAH, YOU CAN
ACTUALLY GET A TAN NOW.

05:44.477 --> 05:47.080
- DO I NEED A TAN?

05:47.080 --> 05:51.418
- YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE,
LIKE, VAMPIRE.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.086
- FOCUS ON COMPS, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.254
- OKAY.

06:00.226 --> 06:02.162
[doorbell rings]

06:04.030 --> 06:05.231
- AH, MY LATIN LOVER'S HERE.
- YEAH.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.400
OH, MY GOD, HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- HEY.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.436
- MY LISTING AT
230 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH

06:09.469 --> 06:10.570
HAS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.339
- OH, MY GOSH.
- YOU'RE BACK IN TOWN?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.174
- SONIA MORGAN INTRODUCED ME
TO IAN REISNER,

06:14.207 --> 06:16.176
WHICH IS A VERY BIG DEVELOPER.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.711
- HE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD
BE RICKY RICARDO'S YOUNGER

06:17.744 --> 06:19.045
BROTHER OF ANOTHER MOTHER.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.413
- BUT WHEN IT CAME
DOWN TO BUSINESS,

06:20.447 --> 06:22.082
IT WASN'T WHAT I
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.249
HOLY...

06:23.283 --> 06:26.219
WHAT I GOT WAS
A STRAIGHT UP FIASCO.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.922
THERE'S MONKEYS CLIMBING
OFF OF THE WALLPAPER.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.757
AND THEN HE DROPPED
A REALLY BIG BOMB ON ME.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.692
- IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
I GOT MY BROKERAGE LICENSE,

06:32.726 --> 06:35.228
AND I PLAN ON BEING YOUR
CO-EXCLUSIVE ON THIS LISTING

06:35.261 --> 06:36.830
AND TAKING HALF THE COMMISSION.

06:36.863 --> 06:40.400
- I WAS FURIOUS, BUT THIS
IS A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.069
AND TODAY, I'M PUTTING
EVERYTHING ASIDE,

06:43.103 --> 06:45.972
AND I'M FOCUSING ON THE
SALE OF THIS LISTING.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.440
- I DON'T START DRINKING
TILL IT'S DARK OUT.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.209
- OKAY.
- BUT LET'S CHEAT A LITTLE BIT

06:49.242 --> 06:51.478
SINCE WE'RE ABOUT TO TALK
ABOUT A $12 MILLION LISTING.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.214
I FIGURE WE CAN
MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.082
WE'RE CO-EXCLUSIVES.
- YES.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.085
- THE REASON WHY THIS IS A
PARTNERSHIP THAT'S GONNA WORK,

06:59.085 --> 07:01.821
I HAVE A DEEP BENCH
OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS,

07:01.855 --> 07:04.391
SO WE NEED A LOT OF THINGS
AND A LOT OF THINGS REAL QUICKLY

07:04.424 --> 07:06.226
TO IMPRESS YOUR
BUYERS AND MY BUYERS.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.661
BUT I NEED FROM YOU
PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.130
I NEED A PRETTY BROCHURE.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.432
I NEED TO GET THIS OUT TO THE
ENTIRE REAL ESTATE COMMUNITY.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.900
I NEED TO SEE OPEN HOUSES.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.037
I NEED TO SEE BROKER
LUNCHEONS FOR EVERY MAJOR FIRM.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.938
I NEED TO SEE A BUSINESS PLAN
OF HOW YOU'RE GONNA MARKET

07:19.039 --> 07:20.540
THIS IN SOUTH
AMERICA AND ASIA,

07:20.573 --> 07:22.909
WHICH IS LIKELY WHERE
WE'RE GONNA FIND A BUYER.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.111
SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK
TO DO IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS

07:25.145 --> 07:26.813
'CAUSE THIS GOES
LIVE IN TEN DAYS.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.649
- IF WE'RE CO-LISTING,
I THINK WE SHOULD SPLIT

07:29.683 --> 07:33.053
THE WORK IN TWO, NO?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.955
- ME WORK FOR YOU?
ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.524
MY JOB IS TO DEVELOP
THE PROJECT,

07:37.557 --> 07:39.793
TO GET IT BUILT ON
TIME AND ON BUDGET.

07:39.826 --> 07:42.328
BUT LISTEN, LUIS, WHAT I WILL
DO FOR YOU IS GO TO ALL

07:42.362 --> 07:44.597
OF YOUR SHOWINGS BECAUSE I WANT
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF BUYERS

07:44.631 --> 07:46.132
YOU'RE ACTUALLY BRINGING.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.234
- OKAY.
YOU WANT ME TO PAY FOR ALL THIS?

07:48.268 --> 07:51.271
- WE'LL DEDUCT FROM THE
COMMISSION ANY SELLING EXPENSES,

07:51.304 --> 07:52.939
AND THEN WE'LL SPLIT IT 50/50
THERE ON.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.507
I'M NOT LOOKING TO TAKE
MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET,

07:54.541 --> 07:57.143
BUT I'M NOT LOOKING TO WORK
9:00 TO 5:00 TO WORK FOR YOU.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.279
YOU WORK FOR ME.
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.880
- I DO.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.383
THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRICED
LISTING OF MY CAREER,

08:03.416 --> 08:05.285
SO I'M GOING TO SWALLOW
MY PRIDE AND DO EVERYTHING

08:05.318 --> 08:06.720
THAT IAN ASKED ME TO DO.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.255
- REMEMBER, IF YOU PROVE THAT
YOU'RE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY YOU

08:09.289 --> 08:12.225
ARE, THEN YOU'LL HELP ME SELL
SOME MORE REAL ESTATE OVER TIME,

08:12.258 --> 08:14.527
AND WE'LL HAVE
A GREAT BUDDING RELATIONSHIP.

08:14.561 --> 08:15.862
SO YOU GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO DO,

08:15.895 --> 08:19.499
AND I GOT A BUSY DAY
AHEAD OF ME TO GO DOWNTOWN.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.267
- OKAY.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.744
- TODAY, I HAVE A PRIVATE
SHOWING OF THE APTHORP.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.712
I GENERATED SO MUCH
INTEREST AND BUZZ

08:32.746 --> 08:34.848
FOR MY BIG OPEN HOUSE IN 2F.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.483
OH, MY GOD, SO MANY PEOPLE.
HI, HI.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.152
LOOK AT THIS MASTER.
THE MASTER IN GINORMOUS.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.055
AND I'VE HAD A LOT
OF PRIME SHOWINGS.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.657
9.9 MILLION, FIVE BEDROOMS.
IT'S PERFECT.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.894
LOOK AT THE CEILINGS.
HOW INCREDIBLE IS THAT?

08:47.927 --> 08:51.097
AND NOW I HAVE IDENTIFIED
A POTENTIAL BUYER

08:51.131 --> 08:53.133
FOR THE NEW LISTING.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.234
HI.
- HEY.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.568
- WELCOME TO THE APTHORP.
- AFTER YOU.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.603
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.171
- OH, MY GOD,
I LOVE YOUR OUTFIT.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.639
AND THE DOG.
HI.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.874
IS HER NAME MOUSY?

09:00.907 --> 09:03.376
- NO, MOTIKA.
- OH, MOTIKA.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.111
- IT MEANS
"LITTLE COTTON BALL."

09:05.145 --> 09:06.312
- COTTON BALL.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.781
- YES.
- HI, COTTON BALL.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.249
I LIKE YOU ALREADY.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.618
THE DOOR OPENS, AND
I SCAN THIS WOMAN,

09:11.651 --> 09:14.721
AND I REGISTER
A LOT OF MONEY.

09:16.022 --> 09:19.459
- HOW TALL ARE THE CEILINGS?

09:19.492 --> 09:20.460
- OOH, I WOULD SAY ABOUT

09:20.493 --> 09:22.062
22 COTTON BALLS
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.130
- [laughs]

09:24.164 --> 09:25.932
- I JUST HOPE SHE DOESN'T
GET DISTRACTED

09:26.032 --> 09:29.169
BY THE HIDEOUS BATHROOMS
AND THE MISMATCHED CABINETRY.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.072
AND THEN YOU COME WITH
WHAT I'M ASSUMING IS A BENTLEY.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.807
YOU HAVE YOUR
DRIVER OPEN THE DOOR,

09:33.840 --> 09:36.176
AND MOTIKA ROLLS OUT.

09:36.209 --> 09:39.045
- [laughs]

09:39.079 --> 09:41.915
- SO TO GIVE
YOU A FEW OPTIONS,

09:41.948 --> 09:44.150
WE DECIDED TO HAVE
FOUR DIFFERENT CABINETRY.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.285
- OH, MY GOD.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.054
- BROWN, WHITE, BLACK--

09:48.054 --> 09:49.089
- THIS IS A COLLAGE.
- ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.257
YES.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.892
LET'S CONTINUE.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.527
SO THIS IS THE MASTER.

09:54.561 --> 09:58.365
YOU HAVE NOT
ONLY ONE FULL BATH, BUT TWO.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.266
- ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS THE MASTER BEDROOM?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.801
BECAUSE IT SEEMS
A LITTLE SMALL.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.503
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN SMALL?

10:03.536 --> 10:06.740
- IS THERE OTHER BEDROOMS
THAT WE CAN TRANSFORM?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.842
- IN THEORY, YES.
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.845
I'M A DEAL MAKER,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDREN?

10:11.878 --> 10:15.215
- WELL, YOU SEE
THE ONE CURRENT.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.884
THE HUMAN PETS
ARE COMING LATER.

10:17.917 --> 10:18.885
- ALICE.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.254
- [laughs]

10:21.287 --> 10:22.355
- HUMAN PETS.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.257
- YOU KNOW.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.327
I LIKE--OKAY.
- [laughing]

10:27.360 --> 10:29.963
I LIKE IT, AND I'M
HAVING SOME IDEAS HERE

10:29.996 --> 10:32.866
OF HOW TO RENOVATE THIS ALREADY.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.068
- OH, YOU'RE THINKING
OF CHANGING THE APARTMENT UP.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.637
- OF COURSE.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.674
OUCH.
THEY DO NEED A GUT.

10:40.707 --> 10:43.243
- ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
I'M FREDRIK EKLUND.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.479
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
- [laughs]

10:46.513 --> 10:47.781
- COMING UP...

10:47.814 --> 10:49.349
- ALL RIGHT, SO HERE IS
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.484
- WHY DON'T YOU HOLD IT
AND LET ME EXPLAIN,

10:51.518 --> 10:53.153
SINCE I HAVE DONE MANY OF THESE
APARTMENTS BEFORE?

10:53.186 --> 10:54.587
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.890
NEXT TIME THERE'S A SHOWING,
YOU CAN DO IT. ALL RIGHT?

10:56.923 --> 10:58.925
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.067
[dance music]

11:07.067 --> 11:15.075
* *

11:23.717 --> 11:24.951
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

11:24.984 --> 11:25.952
- WHAT'S UP?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:25.985 --> 11:26.953
- NICE TO SEE YOU.
WELCOME TO L.A.

11:26.986 --> 11:30.156
- THANKS.
IT IS SO SUNNY HERE.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.092
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THIS PLACE?

11:32.092 --> 11:35.595
- IT'S BASICALLY
A QUINTESSENTIAL BACHELOR PAD.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.864
- AND IT JUST HIT THE MARKET.
- YEAH.

11:37.897 --> 11:40.467
- SO THE ASKING IS 3.9, RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.501
- AND WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO GET IT AT?

11:41.534 --> 11:45.872
- I'M NOT PAYING
A PENNY OVER 3.5.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.641
- 3.5 IS A GOOD HAIRCUT.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.876
- RYAN, IT'S MY ABSOLUTE MAX.

11:49.909 --> 11:53.446
I LOVE THE HOUSE,
BUT I WILL WALK.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.781
- GOT IT.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.549
SO I HAVE YOUR AUTHORITY
TO NEGOTIATE, THEN,

11:56.583 --> 11:59.119
ON YOUR BEHALF,
AND 3.5 IS THE ABSOLUTE MAX.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.086
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.154
YOU GOT TO GET IT DONE.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.355
- OKAY.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.356
- L.A. BROKERS ARE SOFT.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.058
- RIGHT.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.060
- I NEED KING KONG
FROM NEW YORK.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.795
- SO WE'RE GONNA
GO TO WAR, HUH?

12:08.828 --> 12:10.930
EAST COAST VERSE WEST COAST.
BIGGIE VERSE TUPAC.

12:10.964 --> 12:11.965
LET'S DO IT.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.209
- ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GOING TO
230 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH, PLEASE.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.145
THIS WEEK, I HAVE A BUNCH
OF SHOWINGS LINED UP

12:25.178 --> 12:26.346
FOR 230 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.148
DEMOLITION HAS STARTED,

12:28.181 --> 12:30.550
AND IAN'S CRAZY TENANT
HAS MOVED OUT.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.585
I AM HOPING TO GET ENOUGH
TRAFFIC THROUGH THE DOOR

12:32.619 --> 12:34.220
SO THAT I CAN SELL
THIS THING QUICKLY.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.390
IAN, I'M ON MY WAY TO YOU NOW,
ARE YOU READY FOR THE SHOWING,

12:37.424 --> 12:38.758
OR ARE YOU READY
FOR THE SHOWING?

12:38.792 --> 12:42.295
I'M ON 63rd
AND PARK AVENUE.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.968
YOU WANT ME TO PICK
UP YOUR DRY CLEANING?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.171
- ALL RIGHT.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.373
[bleep], I SHOULD'VE
SAID I WAS IN TRIBECA.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.176
I AM HOPING THAT
THIS IS JUST A FAVOR.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.112
KEEP IT RUNNING.
I'LL BE QUICK.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.214
HELLO.

13:01.247 --> 13:02.682
I'M HERE TO PICK
FOR IAN REISNER.

13:02.716 --> 13:03.817
- ONE SECOND.
I'LL GET THAT FOR YOU.

13:03.850 --> 13:04.818
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.786
- HEY, RICHARD.

13:06.820 --> 13:07.921
MY CO-BROKER LUIS
IS A LITTLE LATE.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.523
HE'LL BE HERE SHORTLY.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.259
WHERE DO YOU WORK?
- I WORK DOWN THE STREET.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.260
SO I'M A PLASTIC SURGEON,

13:14.294 --> 13:16.396
SO I LOVE THE IDEA
OF SIMILAR VIEW.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.597
- AH, SO YOU'RE SPOILED.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.699
- I HATE BEING LATE.

13:19.733 --> 13:20.934
MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID
THAT IF I WAS ON TIME,

13:20.967 --> 13:22.502
I WAS FIVE MINUTES LATE.

13:22.535 --> 13:25.305
- YOU'LL HAVE 36 FOOT
OF A LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM

13:25.338 --> 13:26.306
WITH A MASSIVE
KITCHEN IN THE REAR.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.407
- ALL RIGHT.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.943
- THE KITCHEN WOULD
START RIGHT HERE.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.079
YOU'D HAVE A PANTRY,
A DOUBLEWIDE 'FRIGERATOR.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.881
- BEAUTIFUL.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.783
- IT'S GOING TO BE $42.50.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.485
- I THOUGHT HE HAD
ALREADY PAID FOR IT.

13:38.518 --> 13:43.256
- WE DIDN'T HAVE
A CREDIT CARD ON FILE.

13:43.289 --> 13:47.794
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:47.827 --> 13:51.664
- OUR MAINTENANCE AND TAXES
COMBINED ARE $1.70 A FOOT.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.867
- BEING LATE PRETTY MUCH
PUTS ME IN A BAD SPOT

13:53.900 --> 13:56.703
IN FRONT OF THE CLIENTS
BECAUSE I AM NEVER LATE.

13:56.736 --> 13:57.704
SORRY I'M LATE.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.105
- OH, HEY, LUIS.
- HEY, LUIS.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.106
- HOW ARE YOU?

14:00.140 --> 14:01.641
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.143
YOU'RE LOOKING
VERY SHARP, MY FRIEND.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.544
- [chuckles]
- SORRY I'M LATE.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.147
YOU GUYS ALREADY GOT STARTED.
- WE DID.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.248
WELL, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.683
- LET ME GIVE YOU MY CARD.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.284
SINCE WE'RE CO-BROKERS,
I'M NOT GONNA GET IN TROUBLE.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.419
- SOUNDS GREAT.
- FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME

14:12.452 --> 14:13.420
BECAUSE I HAVE ANOTHER
MEETING TO GO TO.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.421
- ANYWAYS,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.955
COME, I'LL WALK YOU GUYS OUT.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.791
I DON'T LIKE THIS.
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.460
THESE ARE MY CLIENTS,
AND I SHOULD'VE BEEN WITH THEM

14:20.493 --> 14:21.695
FOR THE ENTIRE SHOWING.

14:21.728 --> 14:25.198
ALL RIGHT, PLEASURE.
- THANKS.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.403
- [knocks]
- HELLO.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.404
- HI, LUIS.
- HOW ARE YOU?

14:31.438 --> 14:32.472
THANK YOU VERY
MUCH FOR COMING.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.940
- THANK YOU.
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.608
THIS IS IAN REISNER,
SELLER OF THE APARTMENT.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.876
- HOW ARE YOU?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.511
- MASAI.
- COME. COME IN.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.880
- OKAY. SO THIS IS
A WORK IN PROGRESS,

14:40.914 --> 14:44.284
BUT IT'S, I THINK, THE BEST
TIME TO BE ABLE TO COME IN

14:44.317 --> 14:45.518
AND SEE THIS PROPERTY.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.686
- IN TERMS OF
3,000 SQUARE FEETS,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.088
HOW DOES THAT
SUIT YOUR LIFESTYLE?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.856
- IT'S A LITTLE BIG,
BUT I CAN TAKE IT. [laughs]

14:49.889 --> 14:51.124
- BIG IS GOOD.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.393
- THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS
SAY TO MY--BIGGER--

14:53.426 --> 14:56.463
I'M NOT A SIZE QUEEN.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.897
- HE SAYS,
"I'M NOT A SIZE QUEEN."

14:57.931 --> 14:59.466
WHY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT PENISES?

14:59.499 --> 15:00.734
LET'S FOCUS ON CENTRAL PARK.

15:00.767 --> 15:05.038
THIS IS REALLY WHERE
THE MONEY IS. CENTRAL PARK.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.173
- ALL RIGHT, SO HERE IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.508
- WHY DON'T YOU HOLD IT,
AND LET ME EXPLAIN

15:08.541 --> 15:10.176
SINCE I HAVE DONE
MANY OF THESE APARTMENTS BEFORE?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.611
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.213
NEXT TIME THERE'S A SHOWING,
YOU CAN DO IT. ALL RIGHT?

15:13.246 --> 15:17.083
- SO I'M AN EASEL NOW.
WHAT ELSE?

15:17.117 --> 15:18.451
OUR PRICE OF 4,000 A FOOT--
OH, THERE HE IS.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.620
- HEY, RICKY.
- HOW ARE YOU?

15:20.653 --> 15:22.422
GUYS, THIS IS IAN REISNER.
- IAN REISNER.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.823
- HOW YOU DOIN'? ADAM ROTHMAN.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:23.857 --> 15:24.924
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.292
- AND HIS CLIENT--
- SABRINA. PLEASURE.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.894
- MY NAME IS IAN REISNER,
AND MY LITTLE DOGGIE ROSSIE.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.230
- SHE HAS A COUPLE QUESTIONS.
- PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.132
- MY CONCERN WAS THAT
THE CEILINGS WERE LOW.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.133
- YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
- YES.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.501
- WE CAN SHOW THEM MY HOME.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.903
IF I CAN CONVINCE MY PARTNER
TO QUICKLY WALK THE PUPPY,

15:36.936 --> 15:39.739
I'LL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS
AND SHOW YOU A FINISHED PRODUCT.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.874
- I WOULD LOVE THAT.
- IS IT OKAY WITH YOU?

15:40.907 --> 15:41.875
LISTEN, COME ON, TEAM SPIRIT.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.610
RICKY TAKE ROSSIE.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.078
- HE REALLY CALLS YOU RICKY.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.513
- HE DOES CALL ME RICKY.
- I'M TELLING EVERYONE.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.581
- COME, ROSSIE.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.616
THIS IS MY FAULT.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.084
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- THANK YOU.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.318
- THANK YOU.
HAVE FUN WITH THE DOG.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.753
- IAN IS A VERY
IMPORTANT CLIENT TO ME,

15:53.787 --> 15:56.556
AND IF I ALLOWED HIM
TO KEEP TREATING ME LIKE THIS,

15:56.589 --> 15:59.325
HE'S NOT GOING TO RESPECT
ME EVER IN THE FUTURE.

15:59.359 --> 16:03.063
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A [bleep] SOMEWHERE HERE?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.398
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S THE PLACE.

16:13.907 --> 16:16.609
- THIS IS IT.

16:16.643 --> 16:21.047
- ALL RIGHT.
- AFTER YOU.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.149
- [knocks]

16:25.885 --> 16:27.520
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?
- HEY, BUDDY. HOW YOU DOIN'?

16:27.554 --> 16:28.521
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.156
- HI, I'M RYAN.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.391
- RYAN, SAM REAL.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.160
- HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- COME IN.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.829
- WHOA.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.066
THAT'S A VIEW.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.435
YOU DON'T SEE
THAT IN NEW YORK.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.605
- LET'S TAKE A LOOK UPSTAIRS
WHERE THE BEDROOMS ARE.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.511
GENTLEMEN, THE MASTER SUITE.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.779
- I MEAN, IT'S NICE, I GUESS.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.881
- NICE LITTLE BALCONY, HUH?

16:54.914 --> 16:57.384
- WE'RE LOOKING AT,
LIKE, DEAD DIRT.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.553
I FEEL LIKE I'M ON
A DEAD SKI MOUNTAIN.

17:07.727 --> 17:12.032
- LET'S HEAD
DOWN TO THE KITCHEN.

17:13.299 --> 17:16.036
- WHEN WAS THIS
RENOVATED LAST? DO YOU KNOW?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.270
- WHO KNOWS?

17:17.303 --> 17:20.240
- MAKES IT
MORE NEGOTIABLE.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.908
THIS HOUSE IS
GREAT FOR LIGHT,

17:21.941 --> 17:24.077
BUT DEFINITELY
NEEDS SOME RENOVATIONS.

17:24.110 --> 17:27.480
WE GOT TO REDO
THE KITCHEN, THE FLOORS.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.882
HE PROBABLY HAS TO
MOVE A WALL OR TWO

17:28.915 --> 17:30.383
TO MAKE MORE SPACE FOR HIMSELF.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.318
- RYAN, SO LOOK,
I'MA LET YOU GO AT IT.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.787
- OKAY.
- TEACH HIM A THING OR TWO.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.255
- THIS SHOULDN'T
TAKE TOO LONG.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.923
SO WHERE CAN WE
GET THIS DONE?

17:36.956 --> 17:39.225
I DON'T HAVE
TOO MUCH TIME HERE.

17:39.259 --> 17:42.095
- I'M LISTING THIS AT 3.9.
- UH-HUH.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.197
- SO YOU COULD PROBABLY
GET THIS DONE AROUND 3.9.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.800
- SO THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK,
BUT I LIKE WHAT YOU DID.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.768
WHEN DID HE BUY IT,
THE CURRENT OWNER?

17:48.802 --> 17:50.070
- ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.639
- WHAT'D HE PAY FOR IT?
- UH...

17:52.672 --> 17:53.640
- JUST OVER A MILLION, YEAH?

17:53.673 --> 17:54.641
- YEAH.
- YEAH, I LOOKED IT UP.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.842
- GIVE OR TAKE.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.177
- THAT'S A HEALTHY,
HEALTHY RETURN, NO?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.512
- YEAH, IT IS, BUT THIS HOUSE

17:59.546 --> 18:01.281
IS QUINTESSENTIAL
BACHELOR'S PAD.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.016
- MM-HMM.
- ISN'T THAT YOUR CLIENT?

18:03.016 --> 18:04.084
- I KNOW HE LIKES THE HOUSE.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.085
I THINK IT'S
A GREAT HOUSE FOR HIM.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.020
IT'S LIKE A GOOD SKELETON.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.421
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND
SOME MONEY ON THE RENO.

18:08.455 --> 18:09.756
LOOKS LIKE THAT
KITCHEN'S GOT TO BE REDONE.

18:09.789 --> 18:14.461
- OKAY.
SO WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.062
- 3.15.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.397
- 3.15.
- YEAH.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.800
- YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?
- UH-UH.

18:20.834 --> 18:21.935
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.503
IN NEW YORK, WE LIKE TO
WORK WITH SPECIFICS

18:23.536 --> 18:24.671
AND KEEP THINGS DETAILED.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.940
DO YOU USE PRICE
PER SQUARE FOOT OUT HERE?

18:27.040 --> 18:28.308
- UH-HUH.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.176
- OR IS IT MORE LIKE
WHAT YOU'RE FEELIN', BRAH?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.245
THERE'S A HOUSE
THAT'S THREE DOORS DOWN

18:32.278 --> 18:33.947
ON THE MARKET FOR 2.8.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.048
- SO YOU'RE ACTIN' LIKE

18:35.081 --> 18:36.549
I DON'T KNOW
PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.550
- CAN YOU BRING ME A COUNTER?

18:37.584 --> 18:38.585
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A COUNTER IS?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.053
- YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT A COUNTER IS.

18:40.086 --> 18:42.856
- SO BRING ME A COUNTER
AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE.

18:42.889 --> 18:46.526
I'M GONNA SIT HERE,
ENJOY THE SUN.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.727
- I GOT AN OFFER.

18:47.761 --> 18:50.263
IT'S 3.15.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.931
YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.835
- LIGHT DOESN'T WANT TO GO
A DOLLAR OVER 3.5 MILLION.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.605
SO I'M STARTING LOW AT 3.15.

18:58.638 --> 19:02.275
- LET ME GET BACK TO THIS.
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.513
- SO WHAT'S THE COUNTER?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.014
WHERE ARE WE
GONNA GET THIS DONE?

19:08.014 --> 19:12.018
- SO THE COUNTER IS 3.9.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.354
- WHAT?
THAT'S NOT A COUNTER.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.222
THAT'S THE SAME NUMBER
YOU JUST STARTED WITH.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.224
- SORRY.
THERE'S NO BUDGING HERE.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.026
- I FEEL LIKE
I'M TALKING, LIKE,

19:20.060 --> 19:21.895
A DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE TO THIS GUY.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.096
- THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THIS DEAL'S GETTING DONE, RYAN.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.397
- THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.366
UGH.

19:26.399 --> 19:30.770
THIS DEAL MAY BE HARDER
TO GET DONE THAN I THOUGHT.

19:30.804 --> 19:32.038
- COMING UP...

19:32.038 --> 19:34.040
- NO, MY PRICE
IS NOT FOR DISCUSSION.

19:34.074 --> 19:37.510
MY OFFER IS
YOU GIVE ME THE KEY,

19:37.544 --> 19:39.479
AND IT'S READY.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.321
- THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THIS DEAL'S GETTIN' DONE, RYAN.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.556
- THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.057
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY,
"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO."

19:51.091 --> 19:53.059
YOU GOT TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT.
THAT'S HOW DEALS ARE MADE.

19:53.093 --> 19:54.627
THERE'S WORK THAT
HAS TO GO INTO THE HOUSE.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.062
YOU KNOW THERE'S
A LOT ON THE MARKET.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.130
SO IF YOU WANT TO DO A DEAL,

19:57.163 --> 20:00.066
CAN YOU BRING ME
A COUNTER, PLEASE?

20:00.100 --> 20:01.434
- I'LL GO CALL
MY CLIENT AGAIN.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.838
- THANK YOU.
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.173
- THIS WHOLE PLACE IS WEIRD.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.342
IT IS RIDICULOUS
THAT THIS GUY WON'T COUNTER,

20:09.376 --> 20:10.477
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING

20:10.510 --> 20:11.978
THE RENOVATIONS
THAT NEED TO BE DONE.

20:12.012 --> 20:13.980
LIGHT'S GONNA HAVE TO PUT
AT LEAST $1/2 MILLION

20:14.014 --> 20:18.818
IF NOT $1 MILLION INTO THIS
HOUSE TO MAKE IT WHAT HE WANTS.

20:18.852 --> 20:19.953
SO WHAT DO YOU GOT?

20:19.986 --> 20:22.822
- I GOT HIM DOWN.

20:22.856 --> 20:26.926
3.75.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.195
- I MEAN, DO YOU--LIKE, SHOULD
WE GET LUNCH FIRST, MAYBE,

20:29.229 --> 20:30.597
IF WE'RE GONNA BE
HERE FOR A WHILE?

20:30.630 --> 20:32.899
- YOU THINK I'M COMIN'
DOWN ANYMORE, I'M NOT.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.234
- 3.75's NOT GONNA WORK.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.702
THEY GUY BOUGHT
THE HOUSE FOR $1 MILLION.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.237
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- $1 MILLION.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.438
- THAT'S A GOOD
PROFIT, RIGHT?

20:38.471 --> 20:40.874
- IF YOU GET THE DEAL DONE.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.942
- RYAN, LET'S BE HONEST.

20:42.976 --> 20:45.578
YOU KNOW 3.15
IS A PRETTY CRAPPY OFFER.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.615
BEFORE I CAN DO ANYTHING,
YOU NEED TO COME UP.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.618
GO CALL YOUR
CLIENT AND COME UP.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.986
- NO, 'CAUSE I KNOW
WHAT MY CLIENT WANTS.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.355
THE BEST WE'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO DO, OKAY, IS 3.5.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.756
THAT'S IT.
- [chuckles]

20:56.790 --> 20:59.325
- I'LL JUST BE UP-FRONT
WITH YOU. 3.5. THAT'S IT.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.094
THAT'S THE MOST HE'S WILLING
TO PAY, AND HE TOLD ME.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.729
3.75, BEST AND FINAL.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.197
THAT'S IT.

21:04.230 --> 21:07.067
- 3.5. BEST AND FINAL.
THAT'S IT.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.702
- UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T
THINK WE'RE GOING ANYWHERE.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.904
- LIGHT MADE IT VERY CLEAR.

21:10.937 --> 21:15.075
HE'S NOT PAYING
A PENNY OVER 3.5 MILLION,

21:15.108 --> 21:16.676
SO I'M STUCK HERE.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.145
SO WE DON'T HAVE A DEAL.
- WE DON'T HAVE A DEAL.

21:19.179 --> 21:20.780
- IF YOUR CLIENT
GETS REALISTIC, LET ME KNOW.

21:20.814 --> 21:23.083
- HAVE A NICE FLIGHT HOME.
ENJOY THAT COLD WEATHER.

21:23.083 --> 21:26.353
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I CAME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE,

21:26.386 --> 21:28.188
AND I'M DEALING
WITH UNREASONABLE SELLERS.

21:28.221 --> 21:29.289
THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.

21:29.322 --> 21:32.092
ACTUALLY,
HOW DO I GET A CAB UP HERE?

21:32.092 --> 21:36.563
- IT'S A LONG WALK
DOWN THE HILL, BUDDY.

21:36.596 --> 21:37.997
- DICK.

21:45.105 --> 21:46.339
- OKAY, SO PAY ATTENTION.

21:46.373 --> 21:49.843
IN ABOUT THREE MINUTES,
I HAVE THIS BUYER COMING BACK.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.745
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HER.
SHE WANTS TO DO SOME CHANGES.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.346
- WHAT DOES SHE WANT?
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.547
SHE'S BRINGING
SOME SORT OF PLAN.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.117
TODAY I HAVE A SECOND
SHOWING/MEETING,

21:57.150 --> 21:59.152
ACTUALLY,
WITH ALICE AND HER AGENT,

21:59.185 --> 22:01.287
AND THEY'VE DRAWN UP
ACTUAL BLUEPRINTS

22:01.321 --> 22:03.957
FOR WHAT THEIR PERFECT APARTMENT
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

22:04.057 --> 22:05.825
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS IS THE BUYER.

22:05.859 --> 22:07.360
SO JUST DON'T
RUIN THIS FOR ME.

22:07.394 --> 22:10.397
ARI, HE KNOWS THE BONES OF THIS
BUILDING OR THIS APARTMENT.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.066
I NEED HIM THERE TO SAY,
"IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?"

22:13.066 --> 22:14.134
[doorbell rings]
OKAY, SHE'S HERE. JUST--

22:14.167 --> 22:15.935
- AM I SUPPOSED TO
JUST STAY HERE?

22:15.969 --> 22:17.103
- BE QUIET.

22:17.137 --> 22:18.204
- I'M NOT--
SHOULD I SAY HELLO TO HER?

22:18.238 --> 22:19.205
- SHH!

22:19.239 --> 22:21.174
HI.
- HELLO AGAIN.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.209
- HI, BEAUTIFUL.
- HOW ARE YOU?

22:23.243 --> 22:24.844
- [smooching]

22:24.878 --> 22:27.213
HI, BOBBY.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING KISSES.

22:27.247 --> 22:28.948
I DON'T WANT ANYONE OR ANYTHING
TO JEOPARDIZE THIS DEAL.

22:28.982 --> 22:31.418
ALICE IS ALICE.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.386
SHE'S GONNA BE, YOU KNOW,
A BIG PERSONALITY LIKE SHE IS,

22:33.420 --> 22:36.456
AND ARI NEEDS TO
KEEP IT DOWN AND CALM.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.924
I BROUGHT ARI HERE,
MY CLIENT,

22:37.957 --> 22:40.593
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
SOME CHANGES TO THE APARTMENT.

22:40.627 --> 22:43.930
- CORRECT. I HAVE
A FOREVER-CHANGING WARDROBE.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.365
[laughs]

22:45.398 --> 22:48.101
SO IT NEEDS TO BE
SOMETHING LARGE

22:48.134 --> 22:51.938
THAT IT CAN ACCOMMODATE
DIFFERENT SEASONS.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.107
- IS THAT A FLOOR PLAN?
- YES.

22:54.140 --> 22:58.645
WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE IS THAT
I TOOK THAT MASTER BATHROOM,

22:58.678 --> 23:00.814
SWITCHED IT OVER HERE--
- OH, YOU MOVED THE BATHROOMS?

23:00.847 --> 23:01.915
- YEAH.

23:01.948 --> 23:05.719
- YEAH, THAT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

23:05.752 --> 23:09.089
- WE ACKNOWLEDGE
THE BATHROOMS AND THE KITCHENS

23:09.122 --> 23:10.957
NEEDS TO BE GUTTED.
- RIGHT.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.059
- BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS
ADDITIONAL WORK ON TOP OF THAT.

23:13.093 --> 23:15.628
YOU WANT TO,
YOU KNOW, COMBINE BEDROOMS,

23:15.662 --> 23:17.063
MOVE SOME BATHROOMS,
MAKE THEM LARGER,

23:17.097 --> 23:18.131
WALK-IN CLOSETS.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.165
THAT'S A LOT OF WORK FOR US.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.375
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA SAY.
- DON'T SAY IT.

23:28.408 --> 23:32.078
- YOU CAN SAY IT FOR ME.
- DON'T SAY IT.

23:32.112 --> 23:33.680
IT'S A NO.

23:33.713 --> 23:37.183
- NO, MY PRICE
IS NOT FOR DISCUSSION.

23:37.217 --> 23:40.920
MY OFFER IS YOU GIVE ME THE KEY,
AND IT'S READY.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.758
- WELL, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT IT PRIVATELY...

23:44.791 --> 23:46.559
- SURE.
- I THINK.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.660
- WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS TAKE THIS?

23:47.694 --> 23:48.661
- DO YOU WANT--
DO YOU WANT TO STAY HERE?

23:48.695 --> 23:49.662
- ABSOLUTELY.
- YEAH. I MEAN I--

23:49.696 --> 23:51.564
- WE'LL WAIT HERE.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.565
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.667
THIS IS TURNING
INTO A NEGOTIATION.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.302
- WE'RE GONNA--WE'LL BE BACK.

23:56.336 --> 23:58.371
- I NEVER INCLUDE
SELLERS LIKE THIS.

23:58.405 --> 24:00.173
I BROUGHT YOU HERE
FOR CONSTRUCTION,

24:00.206 --> 24:01.441
AND NOW I'M IN THIS SITUATION,
SO WE GOT TO SELL.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.742
- SHE'S CRAZY.

24:02.776 --> 24:04.310
- NO, SHE'S RICH,
AND SHE WANTS THE APARTMENT.

24:04.344 --> 24:06.513
LISTEN TO ME NOW.
WHAT IS YOUR BOTTOM LINE HERE?

24:06.546 --> 24:08.948
- 9.5 INCLUDING RENOVATIONS.

24:09.049 --> 24:10.650
- LET'S DO IT.

24:10.684 --> 24:14.087
- I CAN HEAR MY OWN PULSE.
BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.488
9.5, WE ARE SO CLOSE.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.792
- MY CLIENT IS EXCITED OVER
THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING A DEAL.

24:18.825 --> 24:22.462
HOWEVER, HE'S A BIT DISAPPOINTED
IN THE ACTUAL NUMBER.

24:22.495 --> 24:25.665
HE WON'T ACCEPT
ANYTHING BELOW 9.7,

24:25.699 --> 24:30.470
BUT IN THAT PRICE, IT WILL BE
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD WANT.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.910
- I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION OF OUR OWN.

24:36.943 --> 24:40.313
- OKAY. COULD YOU GIVE US
A FEW MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT IT?

24:40.347 --> 24:42.649
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.184
- OKAY.

24:44.217 --> 24:46.519
I THINK WE'RE COMING IN ABOUT

24:46.553 --> 24:51.491
$100 UNDER A SQUARE FOOT
OF THE AVERAGE.

24:51.524 --> 24:54.194
- WELL, LET'S FACE IT.
IT'S A SECOND FLOOR.

24:54.227 --> 24:57.197
- DO YOU FEEL THE RUSH?
DO YOU GET GOOSEBUMPS?

24:57.230 --> 24:58.431
- NO.

24:58.465 --> 25:00.033
- DO YOU FEEL THE
IMPORTANCE OF THIS MOMENT?

25:00.066 --> 25:02.535
- NO.
- WHAT DO YOU FEEL, THEN?

25:02.569 --> 25:04.871
- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

25:04.904 --> 25:05.939
- ALL RIGHT.

25:06.039 --> 25:07.841
- HEY, GUYS,
DO YOU WANT TO COME IN?

25:07.874 --> 25:09.242
- YEAH.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.044
OH, MY GOD. I LOVE
THIS APARTMENT SO MUCH.

25:11.044 --> 25:12.045
I COULD SPEND ALL NIGHT HERE.

25:12.045 --> 25:13.179
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

25:13.213 --> 25:16.816
- THE ABSOLUTE
MAXIMUM WE COULD DO IS 9.5.

25:16.850 --> 25:20.387
- 9.5 AS--INCLUDING THE WORK?

25:20.420 --> 25:23.690
- EVERYTHING, YEAH.

25:26.793 --> 25:29.095
- OKAY. LET'S DO IT.

25:29.129 --> 25:30.196
- WE HAVE A DEAL.
- [laughs]

25:30.230 --> 25:31.564
- HE SAID YES.
WE GOT A DEAL.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.166
- LET'S SAY YES
BEFORE HE CHANGES HIS MIND.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.801
I MEAN, HE'S KNOWN FOR--
- ALL RIGHT.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.970
EVERYBODY SHAKE HANDS QUICK.
- AHH!

25:37.070 --> 25:39.539
[triumphant grunt]

25:39.572 --> 25:41.074
WHAT!

25:41.107 --> 25:42.776
- THANK YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.578
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25:55.822 --> 25:58.725
- I'M IN LOS ANGELES
ALL BY MYSELF,

25:58.758 --> 26:02.062
AND I CAN'T
GET THE DEAL DONE.

26:02.095 --> 26:04.664
I KNOW I NEED TO CALL LIGHT,

26:04.698 --> 26:07.367
BUT I CAN'T
BRING MYSELF TO DO IT.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.769
I MEAN, HE FLEW ME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE,

26:09.803 --> 26:11.504
AND I DIDN'T
GET THE DEAL DONE.

26:11.538 --> 26:14.641
[phone line rings]

26:14.674 --> 26:18.511
THE ONE PERSON I REALLY
WANT TO TALK TO IS EMILIA,

26:18.545 --> 26:21.247
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HER

26:21.281 --> 26:23.416
FOR DAYS BECAUSE
SHE WON'T TAKE MY CALLS.

26:23.450 --> 26:26.086
[phone line ringing]

26:26.119 --> 26:29.055
- PLEASE LEAVE YOUR
MESSAGE FOR [...]

26:29.055 --> 26:31.358
[beeps]

26:31.391 --> 26:32.559
- HEY, IT'S ME.

26:32.592 --> 26:36.896
I AM IN L.A., BUT I MISS YOU.

26:36.930 --> 26:38.198
GIVE ME A CALL. BYE.

26:51.211 --> 26:54.381
[phone ringing]

26:57.150 --> 27:01.354
- HELLO?

27:17.470 --> 27:19.439
- ALL RIGHT. THANKS, SAM.
I'LL TALK TO YOU.

27:19.472 --> 27:21.241
OH!

27:21.274 --> 27:23.309
THANK GOD.

27:23.343 --> 27:26.046
[phone line rings]

27:26.079 --> 27:28.882
- MR. LIGHT.

27:28.915 --> 27:31.117
- I DO. I DO.

27:31.151 --> 27:35.155
THE HOUSE IS YOURS.
3 1/2 MILLION, NOT A PENNY MORE.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.762
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.267
ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.069
YES!

27:49.102 --> 27:53.406
I WAS NEVER WORRIED.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.675
HUH!

27:55.709 --> 27:56.710
WHEW...

28:02.182 --> 28:03.717
- IAN, THERE HE IS.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.085
- HEY, RICKY, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD MORNING.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.486
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
HOW DO I LOOK?

28:06.519 --> 28:08.321
- YOU LOOK LIKE
A MILLION BUCKS.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.123
- NO, I LOOK HAPPY! HAPPY!
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:10.156 --> 28:11.658
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:11.691 --> 28:13.026
- DESPITE ALL THE CRAZY SHOWINGS
I HAD WITH IAN,

28:13.059 --> 28:15.695
I FINALLY GOT
AN OFFER FOR $11 MILLION.

28:15.729 --> 28:17.163
I GOT GOOD NEWS.
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S UP?

28:17.197 --> 28:18.898
- AND I WANTED
TO DELIVER THEM PERSONALLY.

28:18.932 --> 28:20.100
- WHAT'S UP?

28:20.133 --> 28:22.035
- LAST NIGHT,
I GOT AN OFFER AT $11 MILLION,

28:22.035 --> 28:24.270
ALL CASH, CLOSING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

28:24.304 --> 28:26.573
LET'S GO.

28:26.606 --> 28:29.209
- 11 MILLION BUCKS.

28:29.242 --> 28:31.277
- 11 MILLION BUCKS.
WHY ARE YOU NOT HAPPY?

28:31.311 --> 28:32.679
- IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT HAPPY.
I'M HAPPY YOU CAME.

28:32.712 --> 28:35.382
I WAS GONNA CALL A MEETING
FOR TOMORROW WITH YOU ANYWAY.

28:35.415 --> 28:37.217
- OKAY.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.919
- I FOUND A BUYER, TOO, SO THIS
IS GONNA SHOCK YOU. 11.5.

28:39.953 --> 28:41.321
- COME ON.

28:41.354 --> 28:43.523
THE PARTNERSHIP, IT'S WORKING.
- YEAH.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.126
BUT IF YOU REMEMBER,
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS A BUYER

28:46.159 --> 28:48.328
THAT HAD BEEN SNOOPING
AROUND FOR THE LAST MONTH,

28:48.361 --> 28:50.330
AND THAT WAS THE ONE
EXCLUSION IN THE CONTRACT,

28:50.363 --> 28:53.199
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU'RE GONNA BE EXCLUDED

28:53.233 --> 28:55.869
FROM THE TRANSACTION.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.804
- LISTEN, THERE'S BEEN
A CUSTOMER THAT'S SHOWN

28:57.837 --> 29:00.373
SOME INTEREST, SO YOU KNOW
THAT IF THEY WERE TO BUY,

29:00.407 --> 29:02.208
I WOULD NEED TO HAVE
AN EXCLUSION FOR THAT.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.677
- I UNDERSTAND.

29:03.710 --> 29:04.678
SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA GIVE ME

29:04.711 --> 29:05.912
A CHANCE TO GO BACK
TO MY OFFER?

29:06.012 --> 29:07.881
- WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA GET,
LIKE, 11.7, 11.8,

29:07.914 --> 29:10.116
AND I'M GONNA RISK
LOSING THE 11.5 BUYER.

29:10.150 --> 29:11.418
- IAN--

29:11.451 --> 29:12.719
- THEY'RE WILLING TO SIGN
THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.788
WE ALREADY DRAFTED A CONTRACT.
I'M TAKIN' 11.5.

29:14.821 --> 29:17.023
- LET ME JUST AT LEAST
TRY TO GET SOME--SOMEONE UP.

29:17.023 --> 29:20.760
- HOW MUCH BETTER CAN I DO?
11.5, THAT'S 4,000 A FOOT.

29:20.794 --> 29:25.165
I'M DONE.
TRADING HOUSE IS CLOSED.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.404
- IAN, I HAVE DONE SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST BRING PEOPLE HERE.

29:31.438 --> 29:33.039
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO

29:33.073 --> 29:34.341
WHEN WE FIRST MET, I'VE DONE--

29:34.374 --> 29:36.710
- YOU HAVE,
BUT WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

29:36.743 --> 29:37.944
- LET ME--LET ME EXPLAIN,
PLEASE, LET ME EXPLAIN.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.046
- SOME EXPLAINING TO DO?
NOW YOU ARE RICKY RICARDO.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.482
- LISTEN, I HAVE LET YOU CALL
ME RICKY RICARDO ALL YOU WANT.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.317
- YOU HAVE SOME
EXPLAINING TO DO, RICKY.

29:44.351 --> 29:45.452
- LISTEN. ONE SECOND.

29:45.485 --> 29:46.453
- "LUCY, LUCY, YOU HAVE
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO."

29:46.486 --> 29:47.487
- YES.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.589
- OH, MY GOD,
HE IS SO RICKY RICARDO.

29:49.622 --> 29:53.526
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
TH--OKAY.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.627
I HAVE DONE
DRY CLEANING FOR YOU.

29:54.661 --> 29:56.062
I HAVE TAKEN THIS LISTING.

29:56.096 --> 29:57.397
WHEN YOU THEN SURPRISE ME
WITH THE FACT THAT

29:57.430 --> 29:59.065
YOU'RE GOING TO BE A CO-BROKER,
I AGREE TO THAT,

29:59.065 --> 30:00.266
ALREADY TAKING
1/2 OF MY COMMISSION.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.369
I HAVE BUSTED MY ASS
BECAUSE I RESPECT YOU,

30:02.402 --> 30:03.803
BECAUSE I WANT THIS
RELATIONSHIP TO GROW.

30:03.837 --> 30:05.772
BUT I'M NOT ASKING YOU
NOT TO TAKE THIS OFFER.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.241
THE ONLY THING THAT
I'M ASKING IS A CHANCE FOR ME

30:08.274 --> 30:13.179
TO COME BACK TO MY CLIENT
AND TRY TO GET HIM UP.

30:13.213 --> 30:16.149
- IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
PULL A BUNNY OUT OF A HAT,

30:16.182 --> 30:17.650
AND IF YOU WANT
TO GET BACK IN THE DEAL,

30:17.684 --> 30:19.085
WELL, THEN GO AHEAD.
TAKE A DAY.

30:19.119 --> 30:21.855
BUT LISTEN, I'M GETTIN'
VERY CLOSE TO SIGNING THIS DEAL.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.857
THE TERM SHEET IS OUT.
THE CONTRACT IS OUT.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.225
THE FLOOR PLANS
ARE AGREED TO.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.360
THEY SHOWED ME PROOF OF FUNDS.

30:27.394 --> 30:29.829
SO DO YOUR THING, BUT REALIZE
TO JUSTIFY PAYING YOU

30:29.863 --> 30:31.364
A COMMISSION TO RISK THIS DEAL,

30:31.398 --> 30:33.066
IT'S GOT TO BE
BASICALLY ASKING PRICE.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.069
YOU HAVE TILL
10:00 A.M. TOMORROW.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.938
- PROMISE ME THAT IF BY
10:00 TOMORROW I HAVE AN OFFER,

30:38.972 --> 30:40.807
PLEASE SHAKE ON THE FACT
THAT WE WILL ACCEPT THAT.

30:40.840 --> 30:41.941
- OKAY.
- THAT'S ALL I ASK.

30:41.975 --> 30:43.910
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK TODAY.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.211
- I APPRECIATE IT, IAN.
- THANK YOU.

30:45.245 --> 30:46.913
- GOOD-BYE.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.214
- COMING UP...

30:48.248 --> 30:50.183
- IF I DON'T HEAR
FROM YOU BY 10:00 TOMORROW,

30:50.216 --> 30:51.418
WE WILL LOSE THIS PLACE.

30:51.451 --> 30:54.587
18 HOURS.
THE CLOCK IS [bleep] TICKING.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.463
[phone line rings]

31:03.496 --> 31:05.498
- THIS PLACE IS THE WORST.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.834
THERE'S, LIKE,
A FILM CREW ON EVERY CORNER.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.936
ALL THE BUILDINGS
HERE ARE SO SHORT.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.538
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'M THE ONLY PERSON I'VE SEEN

31:11.571 --> 31:13.239
WEARING A TIE.

31:13.273 --> 31:14.674
EVERYONE HERE
IS WEARING FANNY PACKS

31:14.708 --> 31:17.610
AND SHORT SHORTS,
AND IT'S WEDNESDAY MORNING.

31:17.644 --> 31:21.281
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE HAVE JOBS.
EVERYONE'S SHOPPING.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.650
THIS IS, LIKE,
SO TRYING TO BE FIFTH AVENUE.

31:23.683 --> 31:26.086
AND THEY ALL DRIVE
REALLY EXPENSIVE CARS,

31:26.119 --> 31:30.190
WHICH I CAN ONLY ASSUME ARE
ON VERY HIGH MONTHLY LEASES.

31:30.223 --> 31:32.225
YOU KNOW HOW THERE'S,
LIKE, STARS IN THE SIDEWALK?

31:32.258 --> 31:34.794
DAVID SPADE HAS A STAR HERE.

31:34.828 --> 31:36.996
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY
GAVE DAVID SPADE A STAR.

31:37.097 --> 31:38.565
THIS PLACE IS SO STUPID.

31:38.598 --> 31:43.103
STUPID PALM TREES,
STUPID SHOPS, STUPID KALE SALADS

31:43.103 --> 31:46.473
WITH STUPID, STUPID L.A.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.248
STUPID OCEAN.

32:01.755 --> 32:05.225
- JORDAN.
- YES, SIR?

32:05.258 --> 32:09.829
- THIS OFFICE IS STARTING
TO GET REALLY MESSY.

32:09.863 --> 32:12.232
- YOUR CORNER
SEEMS TO BE MESSIER

32:12.265 --> 32:13.533
THAN OTHER CORNERS
OF THE OFFICE.

32:13.566 --> 32:14.901
- BUT THAT'S WHY
I HAVE YOU, JORDAN.

32:14.934 --> 32:17.570
THAT'S WHY I PAY YOU
AN OBSCENE AMOUNT OF MONEY.

32:17.604 --> 32:19.506
[phone chimes]

32:19.539 --> 32:21.107
STOP TYPING.

32:21.141 --> 32:24.377
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:24.411 --> 32:27.347
BOBBY NEIL.
"FREDRIK, WE HAVE A GLITCH."

32:27.380 --> 32:31.518
ALICE FINANCIAL ADVISORS
LOWERED HER PURCHASE POWER

32:31.551 --> 32:33.153
TO 5 MILLION.

32:33.186 --> 32:34.721
NO, NO.

32:34.754 --> 32:36.489
THE CONTRACT PRICE IS 9.5.

32:36.523 --> 32:38.091
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:38.124 --> 32:41.227
2A IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

32:41.261 --> 32:42.629
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:42.662 --> 32:45.231

32:45.265 --> 32:47.434

32:47.467 --> 32:52.238
HE'S GONNA CHOP
MY SWEDISH MEATBALLS OFF.

32:52.272 --> 32:54.674
I HAVE TO CALL ARI, AND I HAVE
TO BREAK THE NEWS TO HIM,

32:54.708 --> 32:57.444
AND I'M GONNA
NEED A DRINK FOR THIS.

32:57.477 --> 33:01.181
CHAMPAGNE--CHAMPAGNE
GLASS IS WHEN YOU CELEBRATE.

33:03.717 --> 33:08.355
- ARI, I DON'T HAVE
THE BEST OF NEWS.

33:08.388 --> 33:10.056
- 2A...

33:10.056 --> 33:11.558
IS--DIED.

33:11.591 --> 33:14.728
SHE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

33:18.598 --> 33:19.966
- I JUST GOT THE E-MAIL NOW.

33:20.066 --> 33:23.703
I WANTED TO CALL YOU
AS SOON AS I FOUND--

33:36.082 --> 33:38.585
[phone line rings]

33:41.955 --> 33:43.656

33:43.690 --> 33:45.358

VOICE MESSAGE SYSTEM.

33:45.392 --> 33:47.727

[beeps]

33:47.761 --> 33:48.995

33:51.131 --> 33:52.365
TO PRESENT YOUR

33:52.399 --> 33:54.801
THIS IS THE THING.

33:54.834 --> 33:56.269
HE'S TELLING ME THAT
HE HAS ANOTHER OFFER

33:56.302 --> 33:58.938
THAT HE'S GOING TO ACCEPT,
SO PLEASE CALL ME BY DAY'S END.

33:58.972 --> 34:00.173
I WILL BE AVAILABLE
FOR THE REST OF THE DAYS,

34:00.206 --> 34:02.742
BUT WE HAVE TO
COME UP WITH FULL ASKING.

34:02.776 --> 34:04.711
IF WE DON'T,
WE'RE DONE, AND WE LOSE.

34:04.744 --> 34:06.780
CALL ME BACK. THANK YOU.

34:08.848 --> 34:12.452
[phone line rings]

34:12.485 --> 34:14.521

34:14.554 --> 34:16.756
RENITA, HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM THE BUYERS

34:16.790 --> 34:18.591
AT 230 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH,
HAVE THEY CALLED THE OFFICE?

34:18.625 --> 34:22.395
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEM
IN THE PAST SIX HOURS.

34:24.064 --> 34:27.067

34:29.703 --> 34:31.404
- I HAVE LESS THAN 18 HOURS
TO BRING MY BUYERS UP

34:31.438 --> 34:33.973

THANK YOU.

34:40.980 --> 34:43.450

34:43.483 --> 34:44.617

IS MOSTLY ABOUT WAITING,

34:44.651 --> 34:48.621
AND I CANNOT--
I NEED TO DISTRACT MYSELF.

PLEASE CALL ME BACK.

HAS ALWAYS BEEN

36:34.494 --> 36:38.064
EXPANSION ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

36:38.098 --> 36:40.367
SO ANYONE HERE
THAT'S NOT WITH US,

36:40.400 --> 36:42.302
YOU SHOULD BE [bleep] SCARED.

36:42.335 --> 36:44.771
[laughter and applause]

36:44.804 --> 36:47.173
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

36:50.110 --> 36:52.078
WELCOME TO THE GREATEST
REAL ESTATE OFFICE

36:52.078 --> 36:54.981
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

36:55.081 --> 36:56.182
WE WILL.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.084
- BY THE WAY, THIS IS WILLIAM.
WILLIAM, RYAN.

36:58.118 --> 36:59.919
- SORRY.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND FOR ME.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.788
HELLO.

37:01.821 --> 37:03.556
HEY.

37:03.590 --> 37:05.025
HEY, I CAN'T--I'M IN THE BACK

37:05.025 --> 37:06.926
OF A PARTY RIGHT NOW
FOR OUR OPENING.

37:07.027 --> 37:09.062
CAN YOU HOLD ON ONE SECOND?
I'M GONNA STEP OUTSIDE.

37:09.095 --> 37:11.765
EMILIA, FINALLY!

37:13.933 --> 37:16.102
HELLO.

37:17.704 --> 37:19.472
I WANT TO SEE YOU.

37:19.506 --> 37:21.675
BUT AS SOON AS I WRAP THIS UP,
I'M GONNA FLY BACK.

37:21.708 --> 37:24.144
MAYBE WE CAN DO DINNER,
JUST YOU AND ME,

37:24.177 --> 37:27.947
AND WE CAN TALK.

37:28.048 --> 37:32.252
JUST ONE DINNER.

37:33.586 --> 37:37.057
OKAY?

37:37.057 --> 37:39.626
OKAY, I MISS YOU.

37:42.929 --> 37:44.864
I'M REALLY JUST,
YOU KNOW, GRATEFUL

37:44.898 --> 37:47.834
THAT EMILIA IS GIVING ME
A SECOND CHANCE.

37:47.867 --> 37:49.436
I JUST NEED TO GET BACK
TO NEW YORK TO SHOW HER

37:49.469 --> 37:50.603
THAT I DESERVE IT.

37:50.637 --> 37:53.206
[sighs]

37:54.541 --> 37:56.543
OKAY.

38:02.015 --> 38:04.150
- NO, NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND.

38:04.184 --> 38:06.619
THIS IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE
WORTH WAY OVER 10 MILLION

38:06.653 --> 38:08.154
WHEN THOSE BATHROOMS
AND THE KITCHEN IS FINISHED.

38:08.188 --> 38:12.325
MOVE IN, AND THEN YOU CAN
RENOVATE BATHROOM BY BATHROOM.

38:12.359 --> 38:14.027
[sighs]
OKAY.

38:14.027 --> 38:17.797
WELL, CALL ME WHEN YOUR
CLIENT CHANGES HIS MIND, OKAY?

38:17.831 --> 38:19.366
OH...

38:19.399 --> 38:20.934
I'VE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY
TO FIND A BUYER

38:21.034 --> 38:23.570
FOR MY LISTING AT THE APTHORP.

38:23.603 --> 38:25.905
IN TWO DAYS FROM NOW,
THE LISTING AGREEMENT IS OVER,

38:25.939 --> 38:28.508
AND ARI'S CALLING ME NONSTOP,
AND I FEEL SO FRUSTRATED.

38:28.541 --> 38:30.210
I DON'T HAVE A SINGLE
BITE AT THIS POINT.

38:30.243 --> 38:33.413
CAN WE TALK ABOUT 2A
FOR A LITTLE BIT, THE APTHORP?

38:33.446 --> 38:34.514
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

38:34.547 --> 38:36.349
SO I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED WITH LISA.

38:36.383 --> 38:38.251
SHE CAME LAST WEEK WITH
HER CLIENT. DID YOU FOLLOW UP?

38:38.284 --> 38:40.887
- YES, I DID.
- OKAY, CAN YOU--STOP.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.255
CAN YOU STOP DOING THIS WHILE--
- OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

38:42.288 --> 38:44.858
- OKAY, IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M GONNA CHECK WITH ROBERTO.

38:44.891 --> 38:47.327
LET ME CALL HIM RIGHT NOW,
ACTUALLY.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.561
- SHE SAID THE LAYOUT.

38:48.595 --> 38:50.497
SHE WAS NOT A FAN
OF THE LAYOUT AND THE BATHROOMS.

38:50.530 --> 38:51.898
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LAYOUT?

38:51.931 --> 38:53.533
THAT'S A BETTER LAYOUT
THAN THE LAYOUT ON MY FACE.

38:53.566 --> 38:55.702
IT IS SO--
THAT IS AN AMAZING LAYOUT.

38:55.735 --> 38:56.703
- LISTEN,
I KNOW IT'S EXCEPTIONAL.

38:56.736 --> 38:57.704
YOU KNOW IT'S EXCEPTIONAL.

38:57.737 --> 38:58.838
- ROBERTO, HI.

38:58.872 --> 39:00.240
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE
BROKER FREDRIK.

39:00.273 --> 39:05.211
YEAH, 2A IS ABOUT TO GO,
AND I JUST WANT TO CHECK IN.

39:05.245 --> 39:06.913
[sighs] SHE'S NOT
INTERESTED IN RENOVATING.

39:07.013 --> 39:10.750
OKAY. LET ME KNOW IF
YOUR CLIENT CHANGES HER MIND.

39:10.784 --> 39:12.552
[sighs]

39:12.585 --> 39:13.687
- WHAT ABOUT BRAD?

39:13.720 --> 39:14.721
WHAT ABOUT HIS CUSTOMER?
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?

39:14.754 --> 39:16.056
- MY CLIENTS
ARE NOT MOVING FORWARD.

39:16.089 --> 39:18.558
THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH THE BATHROOMS.

39:18.591 --> 39:19.693
BATHROOM AND KITCHENS
ARE EVERYTHING,

39:19.726 --> 39:23.396
ESPECIALLY IN THE, LIKE,
$8 TO $12 MILLION RANGE,

39:23.430 --> 39:24.597
WHICH WE ARE IN.

39:24.631 --> 39:26.533
IT'S IN 207 OFFICES
AROUND THE WORLD, RIGHT?

39:26.566 --> 39:28.768
IT'S IN THE STOREFRONT WINDOWS
HERE IN DOUGLAS ELLIMAN, RIGHT?

39:28.802 --> 39:31.137
- YEAH. I MEAN,
WE HAVE THE PUBLICITY.

39:31.171 --> 39:32.906
THE ISSUE IS THE APARTMENT.

39:32.939 --> 39:35.542
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE KITCHENS.
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE BATHROOMS.

39:35.575 --> 39:37.711
BOTTOM LINE.
THEY'RE NOT DONE.

39:37.744 --> 39:39.045
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

39:39.079 --> 39:41.581
- IT'S MY FAULT.

39:41.614 --> 39:44.150
I SHOULD HAVE PUT
MY FOOT DOWN AND SAID,

39:44.184 --> 39:45.785
"ARI, I RESPECT YOU.

39:45.819 --> 39:50.557
PLEASE TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET.
DON'T LIST IT YET. RENOVATE IT."

39:50.590 --> 39:53.693
BUT I WAS SO EXCITED LIKE
A LITTLE PUPPY--[panting]

39:53.727 --> 39:56.529
TO GET THAT LISTING AND PROVE
TO HIM AGAIN THAT I COULD DO IT.

39:56.563 --> 39:59.366
SO, I, UM,
I MADE A MISTAKE.

39:59.399 --> 40:01.868
- NO, I REFUSE TO LET YOU
GET DOWN ON YOURSELF ON THIS.

40:01.901 --> 40:03.036
DID YOU BUILD--

40:03.069 --> 40:04.170
- IT'S ALWAYS
THE BROKER'S FAULT.

40:04.204 --> 40:07.474
IT'S ALWAYS
THE BROKER'S FAULT.

40:09.509 --> 40:10.877
- COMING UP...

40:10.910 --> 40:13.279
- IF YOUR BUYER FALLS THROUGH
AND MY BUYER'S MOVED ON,

40:13.313 --> 40:15.181
I'M [bleep] OUT OF LUCK.

40:15.215 --> 40:16.616
- LISTEN, IAN.
YOU HAVE MY WORD AS A PARTNER.

40:16.649 --> 40:19.352
I WOULD NEVER
PUT YOU IN THAT SITUATION.

40:24.257 --> 40:27.227
[modern lounge music]

40:27.260 --> 40:30.130
* *

40:30.163 --> 40:31.765
- SHE BASICALLY
WANTS TO CREATE

40:31.798 --> 40:34.000
THE LUXURY TWO-BEDROOM,
WHERE I TAKE THIS AS LIKE A--

40:34.034 --> 40:36.670
- IAN.
- HEY, RICKY, HOW ARE YOU?

40:36.703 --> 40:38.838
- HEY.
- THIS IS MY PARTNER FOR YEARS.

40:38.872 --> 40:39.839
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- HI, LUIS.

40:39.873 --> 40:41.207
- MY PROJECT MANAGER, ALLEN.

40:41.241 --> 40:43.910
- I WAS JUST EXPLAINING
TO HIM THAT MY BUYER'S ALL CASH,

40:43.943 --> 40:45.845
WANTS TO CLOSE IN 30 DAYS,

40:45.879 --> 40:47.414
AND WE CAN START CONSTRUCTION
NEXT MONTH.

40:47.447 --> 40:48.982
ANY UPDATE FROM YOUR END?

40:49.015 --> 40:52.585
- SO THIS MORNING, I WAS ABLE
TO GET THEM TO 11.95 MILLION.

40:52.619 --> 40:56.156
- REALLY?
- YES, FULL ASKING.

40:56.189 --> 40:59.192
- FULL ASKING. WOW.
LOT FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT NOW.

41:01.294 --> 41:04.564
ALL RIGHT.

41:06.332 --> 41:07.801
FOR ME,
THIS IS LIKE A RISK/REWARD.

41:07.834 --> 41:12.105
11.95 SOUNDS GREAT,
BUT IF YOUR BUYER FALLS THROUGH,

41:12.138 --> 41:16.276
AND MY BUYER'S MOVED ON,
I'M [bleep] OUT OF LUCK.

41:16.309 --> 41:17.310
WOW.

41:17.344 --> 41:18.611
WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME?

41:18.645 --> 41:19.612
SERIOUSLY,
YOU GOT SOMETHING LIKE--

41:19.646 --> 41:21.114
I GAVE YOU STRICT TERMS
YESTERDAY.

41:21.147 --> 41:23.149
- I HAVE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
THAT THERE IS TO HAVE.

41:23.183 --> 41:25.418
I HAVE BANK STATEMENTS,
REFERENCE LETTERS,

41:25.452 --> 41:26.653
CREDIT REPORT
FROM BOTH OF THEM.

41:26.686 --> 41:27.921
I HAVE PRETTY MUCH
A WHOLE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

41:27.954 --> 41:29.356
OF WHO THEY ARE.

41:29.389 --> 41:32.592
THE LETTER OF INTENT IS ACTUALLY
SIGNED AND NOTARIZED AS WELL.

41:32.625 --> 41:36.229
THEY ARE AS LEGIT
AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

41:36.262 --> 41:39.866
LISTEN, IAN.

41:39.899 --> 41:42.469
YOU HAVE MY WORD AS A PARTNER,
AS A FRIEND.

41:42.502 --> 41:44.137
I WOULD NEVER
PUT YOU IN THAT SITUATION.

41:44.170 --> 41:47.107
IF WE AGREE TO 11.95 RIGHT NOW,
I WILL SEND YOU EVERYTHING

41:47.140 --> 41:48.641
THAT THERE IS TO KNOW
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.

41:53.446 --> 41:55.548
- OKAY, 11.95.
- WE'RE DOIN' THIS.

41:55.582 --> 41:57.150
- YOU GOT A DEAL.
WE'RE GONNA DO IT WITH YOU.

41:57.183 --> 41:58.284
- WE'RE DOIN' THIS.
OH, MY GOD!

41:58.318 --> 41:59.419
- YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOUR [bleep] DEAL!

41:59.452 --> 42:00.787
- WE HAVE A DEAL.
YOU'RE A WITNESS.

42:00.820 --> 42:03.656
YES! 11.95.

42:03.690 --> 42:06.326
BIGGEST DEAL OF MY CAREER.
LET'S GO!

42:06.359 --> 42:08.395
- LISTEN, FOR
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,

42:08.428 --> 42:09.529
I PUT YOU THROUGH THE RINGER.

42:09.562 --> 42:10.597
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
I JUST WANTED TO SEE

42:10.630 --> 42:12.098
IF YOU'RE A TEAM PLAYER,
IF YOU WOULD

42:12.132 --> 42:14.801
GO THE EXTRA LENGTH
TO HELP ME AS YOUR PARTNER.

42:14.834 --> 42:16.236
SO I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

42:16.269 --> 42:18.338
YOU DID SUCH A GOOD JOB,
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU 3%.

42:18.371 --> 42:20.140
- 3%?

42:20.173 --> 42:21.374
I THINK WITH
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE HERE,

42:21.408 --> 42:25.078
I DESERVE FOUR,
BUT I'LL TAKE THREE. [laughs]

42:25.078 --> 42:26.346
ALL RIGHT, SO I GOT TO GO.
I GOT TO TALK TO THE BUYERS.

42:26.379 --> 42:28.448
I LOVE YOU, IAN, VERY MUCH.
- SEE YOU SOON.

42:28.481 --> 42:29.916
- I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.
