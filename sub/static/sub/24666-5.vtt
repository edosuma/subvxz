from swank hotels

23:53.604 --> 23:56.262
and surrounded by shops
selling luxury goods

23:56.296 --> 23:59.438
and designer brands.

23:59.472 --> 24:02.026
5 housing blocks and 17 stories

24:02.061 --> 24:05.271
containing, well,
everything and everybody

24:05.305 --> 24:07.929
who the rest of Hong Kong
would like to ignore.

24:11.173 --> 24:14.763
While many locals avoid it
for its, well, reputation

24:14.798 --> 24:16.593
and for some
of its less legitimate

24:16.627 --> 24:18.457
business enterprises,
shall we say,

24:18.491 --> 24:21.114
it offers cheap rooms and asylum

24:21.149 --> 24:23.600
for people,
specifically refugees,

24:23.634 --> 24:25.498
from all over the world

24:25.533 --> 24:28.225
and even a taste of home.

24:28.259 --> 24:31.953
When I met Selena
about 15 years ago,

24:31.987 --> 24:35.128
we decided to open
a restaurant in Hong Kong.

24:35.163 --> 24:38.477
But most
of the African guys here,

24:38.511 --> 24:40.409
to be honest,
they don't have money.

24:40.444 --> 24:42.308
Most of them, they are refugees.

24:42.342 --> 24:46.036
So how do we sell
the food to them?

24:49.764 --> 24:51.869
So we opened us a kitchen

24:51.904 --> 24:55.563
for all of them to come
and cook their food,

24:55.597 --> 24:57.841
enjoy and meet new friends.

24:57.875 --> 25:00.360
Then, uh,
they can enjoy themself.

25:00.395 --> 25:02.535
That's how we started.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.508
I moved from Hong Kong

25:09.542 --> 25:11.544
My husband moved from Ghana

25:11.579 --> 25:13.097
to China and Hong Kong.

25:13.132 --> 25:14.547
But we know that if you move

25:14.582 --> 25:16.894
to another country,
it's not easy.

25:16.929 --> 25:20.001
So we try to provide
a place for them

25:20.035 --> 25:22.279

25:22.313 --> 25:23.936

we see a lot of happy face.

Certainly a degree of freedom.

30:51.263 --> 30:54.231
As someone who's
born and raised here,

30:54.266 --> 30:55.992
you can definitely feel a change

30:56.026 --> 30:57.717
in the last five to ten years.

30:57.752 --> 31:00.617
And what we are trying to do
with our music

31:00.651 --> 31:02.895
is to address
that sort of change.

31:02.930 --> 31:04.932
Are you able

I don't know.
Right now, yes.

31:09.419 --> 31:10.799
Say what you want.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.070
You are actually allowed
to play music.

31:12.077 --> 31:13.699
You're allowed to do
whatever you want.

31:13.733 --> 31:15.114
But there's no venue.

31:15.149 --> 31:16.944
There's no space
for you to practice.

31:16.978 --> 31:20.016
I think this is how
the society is limiting

about how things are going,

31:27.092 --> 31:28.887
some things are a constant,

31:28.921 --> 31:31.717
a comfort, a birthright.

31:31.751 --> 31:33.546

Egg yolks,
sweetened condensed milk.

31:35.617 --> 31:37.826
When steamed,
the custard returns

31:37.861 --> 31:39.621
to more molten form.

31:39.656 --> 31:40.933
Braised chicken feet.

31:40.968 --> 31:42.555
First fried, then braised

31:42.590 --> 31:44.143
with ginger and star anise

31:44.178 --> 31:47.250
before being finished
in the steamer.

31:47.284 --> 31:48.803
Is it possible to make a living

31:48.837 --> 31:50.460
playing your kind of music?

31:50.494 --> 31:51.737
- No.
- Impossible.

31:51.771 --> 31:53.049
- No.
- Hence the day job.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.051
Hence the day job.

31:55.085 --> 31:57.398
Actually, Hong Kong is a society

31:57.432 --> 32:00.573
that really values
elitism and professionalism.

32:00.608 --> 32:03.059
- Right.
- But in a way that, um,

32:03.093 --> 32:05.337
we are seeing
even these standards

32:05.371 --> 32:07.132
are falling apart
within the system.

32:07.166 --> 32:09.582
But it's important
to be part of a system

32:09.617 --> 32:11.067
to make any changes at all.

32:11.101 --> 32:12.171
- Right.
- Because,

32:12.206 --> 32:13.269
if you just stay on the fringe,

32:13.276 --> 32:14.863
it's very hard to get people

32:14.898 --> 32:16.935
to listen to you.

32:21.491 --> 32:23.148
What do young people want
in Hong Kong?

32:23.182 --> 32:25.253
Are they different
than the generation before?

32:25.288 --> 32:27.669
Or are they ready
to think about stuff

32:27.704 --> 32:28.774
and get angry?

32:28.808 --> 32:29.982
I think that society itself

32:30.017 --> 32:32.088
is projecting
a really unhealthy image

32:32.122 --> 32:33.882
of what young people
should be like.

32:33.917 --> 32:35.712
Because there's always a model

32:35.746 --> 32:37.956
of what the successful life is,

32:37.990 --> 32:39.440
which is to get a house by 30,

32:39.474 --> 32:41.960
have a family,
that sort of thing.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.307
It's not like you can
actually change anything.

32:44.341 --> 32:46.274
It's quite
a pessimistic thing to say,

32:46.309 --> 32:48.345

34:56.991 --> 34:58.441
Oh, yes.
This is bread and dip.

34:58.475 --> 35:00.236
This is sourdough, chicken fat,

Oh, my God, this food is great.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.610
How long have you been open?

35:29.644 --> 35:30.611
Seven months, only.

35:30.645 --> 35:32.268
Wait a minute.
Only seven months?

35:32.302 --> 35:33.993
- Yeah, yeah.
- So this is your new baby.

35:34.028 --> 35:35.333
It was a little bit
more reflection

35:35.340 --> 35:37.376
about being Chinese.
Like, how do I be modern

35:37.411 --> 35:39.620
but not lose the soul of it?

35:39.654 --> 35:40.897
Now, how important...

35:40.931 --> 35:43.555
And I should be asking...
I should be asking you this...

35:43.589 --> 35:46.213
Feng shui is something
I know nothing about.

35:46.247 --> 35:47.904
When you moved into the space,

35:47.938 --> 35:49.975
did you consult?

35:50.009 --> 35:51.839
- She's my friend, yeah.
- I was guessing.

35:51.873 --> 35:53.185
She's my friend.

35:53.220 --> 35:55.187
Feng shui is just
the environment

35:55.222 --> 35:57.569
and the relationship
between the environment

35:57.603 --> 35:58.811
and the people.

35:58.846 --> 36:00.330
When you're in a restaurant,

36:00.365 --> 36:03.333
when you're eating the food,
the space matters.

36:03.368 --> 36:04.714
It...

36:04.748 --> 36:07.199
It changes the way
you taste the food.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.068
So when you look at this space,

36:14.102 --> 36:17.313
what are you looking for
and what do you do?

36:17.347 --> 36:19.038
There's a couple things.

36:19.073 --> 36:21.317
So number one is,
I use a compass.

36:21.351 --> 36:24.354
So we're northeast, southwest.

36:24.389 --> 36:26.322
So from there,
we have a formula,

36:26.356 --> 36:29.221
and then that will tell us
where the best chi is.

36:29.256 --> 36:31.050
- What is chi?
- The energy

36:31.085 --> 36:34.675
that are given off
by the universe.

36:36.263 --> 36:38.851
So I look around,
and I see the colors

36:38.886 --> 36:41.751
of the decorations
and how the furnitures are.

36:41.785 --> 36:45.927
And then I can say, "Okay,
are these good placements?"

36:45.962 --> 36:48.240
♪

36:48.275 --> 36:50.242
It's all about
the flow of energy,

36:50.277 --> 36:52.106
where... where you're looking at,

36:52.140 --> 36:53.625
where the light comes from.

36:53.659 --> 36:55.627
Which is so...
Wait a minute.

36:55.661 --> 36:56.593
But a lot of what...

36:56.628 --> 36:58.043
A lot of what you've been saying

36:58.077 --> 36:59.527
in fact reminds me

36:59.562 --> 37:02.392
of a certain cinematographer
right now.

37:02.427 --> 37:04.256
Exactly.

37:04.291 --> 37:06.362
I wouldn't know.

37:06.396 --> 37:08.709
Positive energy
harnessed appropriately,

37:08.743 --> 37:10.573
one can turn
one's full attention

37:10.607 --> 37:11.781
to the food.

37:11.815 --> 37:14.128
Sautéed prawns with pomelo pith,

37:14.162 --> 37:16.406
fried shrimp roe, and prawn oil.

37:16.441 --> 37:19.409
Those are dishes that I feel
even Hong Kong people

37:19.444 --> 37:21.239
don't do it so much anymore,

37:21.273 --> 37:23.275
because it's such
an old-fashioned dish.

37:23.310 --> 37:24.794
So we want to make it
cool again.

37:24.828 --> 37:27.279
Tea smoked pigeon,
served medium-rare,

37:27.314 --> 37:29.488

37:31.179 --> 37:32.733

37:32.767 --> 37:34.769
with oyster mushroom fried rice

37:34.804 --> 37:35.839
and shitake broth.

37:35.874 --> 37:37.255
Again, this would feel

37:37.289 --> 37:39.740
like a very traditional
Cantonese dish.

37:39.774 --> 37:41.293
But it's not, because it doesn't

37:41.328 --> 37:44.400

and combination.

stunningly delicious.

37:51.303 --> 37:52.684
There's something that I think

37:52.718 --> 37:54.582
binds all of us together,
which is,

37:54.617 --> 37:58.345
we're trying to reinterpret
Hong Kong culture

37:58.379 --> 38:00.933
in a way that makes sense to us.

38:00.968 --> 38:02.590
I think as we're getting older,

38:02.625 --> 38:05.697
we start to actually enjoy
our own culture.

38:05.731 --> 38:08.424

movie about "The White Girl."
