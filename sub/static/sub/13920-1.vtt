26:45.562 --> 26:47.897
Of course, Lieutenant,
uh, right now,

26:47.982 --> 26:51.734
uh, that island
is off-limits.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.446
Of course,
you being an officer,

26:55.531 --> 26:57.699
you could get a launch.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.742
I'd even be willin'...

26:59.827 --> 27:02.829
to requisition
a boat for you.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.626
[Chuckles]
But another thing
goes on over there.

27:08.711 --> 27:14.340
The, uh, ceremonial
of the boar's tooth.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.426
After they kill the boar,

27:16.510 --> 27:21.306
they... pass around
some of that, uh,

27:21.390 --> 27:24.017
coconut liquor.

27:24.101 --> 27:27.937
And women, uh, dance
with just skirts on.

27:30.065 --> 27:34.861
And everybody gets
to know everybody
pretty well.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.488
And I thought you bein'
up in the shootin' war...

27:37.573 --> 27:40.992
for such a long time
without getting any recreation,

27:41.076 --> 27:45.246
uh, thought you might
be interested.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.957
[Whooping]
Iron belly.

27:48.042 --> 27:51.336
[Men Whooping]

27:51.420 --> 27:54.088
[Whooping Continues]

27:59.261 --> 28:01.262
Here she is, sir.

28:06.477 --> 28:09.896
You are causing
an economic revolution
on this island.

28:09.980 --> 28:13.858
These French planters
can't find a native
to pick a coconut...

28:13.942 --> 28:15.860
or milk a cow...

28:15.944 --> 28:18.363
because you're paying them
10 times as much...

28:18.447 --> 28:21.908
to make these ridiculous
grass skirts.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.660
French planters
stingy stinker!

28:24.745 --> 28:26.746
Like you,
crummy Captain!

28:32.753 --> 28:37.507
I want you to pick up
every scrap of this
paraphernalia now.

28:37.591 --> 28:41.219
And for the last time,
carry it way down there...

28:41.303 --> 28:43.388
beyond that pier...

28:43.472 --> 28:46.724
off navy property.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.947
All right, you men!
Take this stuff down there
past that pier!

29:01.031 --> 29:03.032
Snap to it!

29:05.661 --> 29:07.995
Who is he?
Don't know, sir.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.957
All right, all right.
Come on. Let's go.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.460
Get it down there.
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

29:14.545 --> 29:18.840
Way down there.
Off navy property.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.718
You go too.

29:22.803 --> 29:25.263
All right, Lootellan.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.348
Thank you.

29:29.977 --> 29:32.353
Lieutenant?
Who are you anyway?

29:32.438 --> 29:36.149
Lieutenant Joseph Cable, sir.
I just flew in
on that P.B.Y.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.359
A joyride?
No, sir. Orders.

29:38.485 --> 29:42.113
A marine under orders
to me?
Yes, sir.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.657
This is Commander Harbison,
my executive officer.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.285
Commander.
Lieutenant Cable.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.620
Well, what's it
all about?

29:49.705 --> 29:51.789
Well, sir,

29:51.874 --> 29:54.208
my colonel feels...

29:54.293 --> 29:56.294
that all these islands
are in danger...

29:56.378 --> 30:00.548
because none of us
has been getting any
firsthand intelligence.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.009
We don't know
what the Japanese
are really up to.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.052
He couldn't be more right.

30:05.179 --> 30:08.222
He feels that what
we need is a coast watch.
A coast watch?

30:08.307 --> 30:11.476
Yes, sir.
One of our men
with a radio...

30:11.560 --> 30:14.645
hiding out on one
of the enemy-held islands...

30:14.730 --> 30:16.898
where he could watch
for enemy ships...

30:16.982 --> 30:20.902
when they come down
through the bottleneck
down this way.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.821
What do you think,
Bill?

30:23.906 --> 30:26.699
Well, sir, our pilots
could do a lot of damage...

30:26.783 --> 30:30.244
to enemy convoys with
information like that.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.830
How would you get a man
on one of those islands?

30:32.915 --> 30:35.666
Have to sneak him ashore
somehow, sir.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.669
How long do you think
he could hold out there
sending messages...

30:38.754 --> 30:40.755
before the Japanese
spotted him?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.757
It could be done, sir.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.301
Yeah, but who's
going to do it?

30:45.385 --> 30:49.096
Well, sir,
I've been elected.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.308
You got yourself
quite an assignment, son.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.062
I think I'd be okay...

30:56.146 --> 30:59.482
if I could take a man
with me who really
knew the country.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.818
Headquarters has found out
that there's a French
civilian here...

31:02.903 --> 31:05.571
used to have a plantation
on Marie Louise Island.

31:05.656 --> 31:08.449
Did a lot of hunting
and fishing there.

31:08.534 --> 31:12.828
Marie Louise.
That's a good spot.
Right on the bottleneck.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.540
What's this
Frenchman's name?
Emile De Becque.

31:15.624 --> 31:19.043
Ah! He lives
right up there.

31:19.169 --> 31:23.214
[Cable]
Yes, sir. Do you know him?
Well, I've met him.

31:23.298 --> 31:26.926
But I don't know
very much about him... yet.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.810
Is all this yours?
Yes.

31:35.894 --> 31:40.273
[Miss Forbush]
Is it true that all the planters
on these islands—

31:40.357 --> 31:42.984
Are they really running away
from something?

31:44.528 --> 31:49.740
Uh, who is not running away
from something?

31:49.825 --> 31:51.993
There are fugitives
everywhere.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.412
New York, in Paris,

31:54.496 --> 31:57.081
even in Small Rock.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.166
Yeah, where you come from.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.335
Oh! Little Rock.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.297
Oh, Little. Oh.
[Chuckles]
Yes.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.799
Small Rock.
Excuse me. Little Rock.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.552
You know
any fugitives there?

32:09.636 --> 32:12.597
I'll show you a picture
of a Little Rock fugitive.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.562
I got this clipping
from my mother... today.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.941
Hey.
[Chuckles]

32:24.026 --> 32:26.777
"Ensign Nellie Forbush,

32:26.862 --> 32:30.364
Arkansas's own
Florence Nightingale."

32:30.449 --> 32:32.617
That was written
by Mrs. Leeming,
the social editor.

32:32.743 --> 32:34.952
Hmm.
She went to school
with my mother.

32:35.037 --> 32:38.039
Pretty girl, huh?

32:38.123 --> 32:41.459
That picture was taken
before I knew what...

32:41.543 --> 32:45.504
rain and heat and mud
can do to your disposition.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.258
[Sighs]

32:49.343 --> 32:51.677
But it isn't
raining today.

32:53.722 --> 32:56.724
Gosh, it's beautiful here.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.144
Just look
at that yellow sun.

33:00.228 --> 33:03.731
And way off in the distance,
those lovely little
white clouds.

33:03.815 --> 33:08.069
Those lovely little
white clouds could
easily be gunfire.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.490
Oh, how awful.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.410
On such a day.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.246
Boys getting killed,
people getting—

33:22.125 --> 33:26.295
But you know, Emile, I don't
think it's the end of the world
like everyone else thinks.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.548
Do you?
Perhaps the end
of some worlds.

33:29.633 --> 33:32.009
Not this one.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.512
It can't be.

33:34.596 --> 33:38.766
I— I can't work myself up
to getting that low.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.980
You think I'm crazy too?
They all do over
at the fleet hospital.

33:45.065 --> 33:48.693

Knucklehead Nellie.

It can get

It can?

Hyah!

57:45.629 --> 57:47.547
Oh, hello.

57:47.631 --> 57:49.632
Hello.

57:51.301 --> 57:54.137
Uh, that song—

57:55.389 --> 57:57.974
is it a new
American song?

57:58.058 --> 58:01.227
Well, uh, uh,
it's an American-type song.

58:01.311 --> 58:05.481
We were just kind of, uh,
putting in our own words,
you know.

58:05.566 --> 58:08.776
Uh, uh,
where is everybody?

58:12.614 --> 58:14.949
I left a note for you
at the hospital.

58:16.410 --> 58:20.830
It was to ask you to my home
for dinner next Friday.

58:20.914 --> 58:24.041
Oh, uh—

58:24.126 --> 58:26.586
Well, Emile, I don't think
I'll be able to come.

58:26.712 --> 58:30.298
I have these rehearsals—
I have already invited
some of my friends.

58:30.382 --> 58:32.842
The planters' colony.

58:32.926 --> 58:36.345
Oh. Oh, a big party.

58:36.430 --> 58:39.182
Well— Well,
then if I can't come,
you won't miss me.

58:39.266 --> 58:41.851
But it is for you.

58:41.935 --> 58:45.479
It is for my friends
to meet you...

58:45.564 --> 58:47.565
and, more important,
for you to meet them.

58:47.649 --> 58:52.570
To give you an idea
of what your life
would be like here.

58:52.654 --> 58:54.655
I want you to know
more about me—

58:54.740 --> 58:58.159
how I live and think.

58:58.243 --> 59:00.161
More about you.

59:00.245 --> 59:03.789
Yes. You know
very little about me.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.627
That's right.

59:07.711 --> 59:10.129
Uh, would you sit down?

59:22.059 --> 59:24.435
Do you think about
politics much?

59:24.519 --> 59:28.606
And if so, what do you
think about politics?

59:31.485 --> 59:34.487
I've—
Do you mean that—

59:34.571 --> 59:37.698
Do you mean
my political philosophy?

59:37.783 --> 59:40.493
I think that's what I mean.

59:40.577 --> 59:43.371
Oh.
[Chuckles]

59:43.455 --> 59:45.456
Uh, well,

59:46.875 --> 59:50.461
to begin with, I—

59:50.545 --> 59:55.007
I believe in
the free life and
freedom for everyone.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.885
Like in the Declaration
of Independence?

59:57.970 --> 59:59.887
C'est ça.

59:59.972 --> 01:00:03.557
All men are created
equal, isn't it?

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.643
Emile, you really
believe that?

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:09.355
But of course, Nellie.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:16.487
Well, thank goodness.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.282
Oh.
It's why I am here,

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.578
why I killed a man.

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:31.127
Oh, yes, I, uh—

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:35.589
[Clears Throat]
I meant to ask you
about that too.

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:40.136
Now, uh, I don't want you
to think I'm prying
into your private life...

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.763
asking a lot of personal
questions, but, uh,

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:46.642
I always think
it's interesting...

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:50.313
why a person... kills...

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.398
another person.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:56.402
But of course, Nellie.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.073
That has worried you.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:14.253
When I was a boy,
I carried my hat
in my hand.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:18.090
So, when this man
came to our town,

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:20.843
though my father
said he was good,

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.679
I thought he was bad.

01:01:23.764 --> 01:01:25.765
I was young.

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:31.395
He attracted all the mean
and cruel people to him.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.564
Soon he was running
our town.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:36.859
He could do anything,
take anything.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:39.111
I didn't like that.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:42.907
I was young.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:45.618
I stood up
in the public square.
I made a speech.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.705
I called upon everyone
to stand with me
against this man.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:53.626
- What did they do?
- They walked away.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:58.506
- Why?
- Because they saw him
standing behind me.

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:03.052
I turned.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:07.473
And he said to me,
"I'm going to kill you now."

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.310
We fought.

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:14.814
I was never so strong.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:18.818
I knocked him
to the ground.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:24.907
And when he fell,
his head struck a stone and—

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:35.751
I ran to the waterfront
and joined a cargo boat.

01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:38.754
I didn't even know
where it was going.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:45.010
I stepped off that boat
into another world...

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.681
where I am now,

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.225
and where I want to stay.

01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:57.481
Nellie, will you
marry me?

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:10.494
There are so few days
in our life, Nellie.

01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:13.247
The time I have
with you now...

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:15.332
is precious to me.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:17.751
Have you been thinking?

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.044
Have you been thinking?

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:22.256

Now, before you give us
an answer,

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:44.411
I wanna impress you
with three things.

01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:48.582
First— you are a civilian
and you don't have to go.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:52.419
Second— this is
a very dangerous mission...

01:08:52.504 --> 01:08:55.171
and there's no guarantee
that you will survive...

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:58.383
or that it will do
any good.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:06.725
Third— that it might
do a great good.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.229
It might be the means
of turning the tide
of the war in this area.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.564
Yeah, I understand
all these things.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.193
Are you ready to give us
your answer?

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:18.278
Yes, I am.

01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:21.948
My answer must be no.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.334
When a man faces death,

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:35.087
he must weigh values
very carefully.

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:40.050
He must weigh
the sweetness of his life...

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:43.386
against the thing
he's asked to die for.

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:49.225
The probability of death
is very great...

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.310
for both of us.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:58.151
I know that island well,
Lieutenant Cable.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:05.993
And, uh, I'm not certain
that I believe...

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:09.830
that what you're asking me
to do is— is that—

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:12.499
[Brackett]
We're asking you to help us
lick the Japanese.

01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:16.712
It's as simple as that.
We're against the Japanese.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:19.965
I know what
you are against.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.050
What are you for?

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.307
When I was 22,

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:32.895
I thought the world
hated bullies
as much as I did.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:35.939
I was foolish,
and I killed one.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:41.028
I was forced to flee
to an island.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:46.491
Since then, I have asked
no help from anyone...

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.369
or any country.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:53.498
I have seen
these bullies multiply...

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.500
and grow strong.

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.669
And the world sat by
and watched.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.590
Oh, the hell
with this, De Becque!
Let's be honest!

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:05.677
Aren't you just a guy in love
with a girl and you're putting
her above everything else?

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.434
Yes.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:16.229
I do care about
my life with her...

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:19.399
more than anything else
in the world.

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:23.654
It is the only thing
that is important to me.

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:26.949
This I believe in.
This I'm sure of.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.034
This I have.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.538
I cannot risk
to lose it.

01:11:37.085 --> 01:11:39.086
Good day, gentlemen.

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:53.016
He's an honest man,
but he's wrong.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:56.728
Of course we can't
guarantee him
a better world if we win.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:12:01.066
The point is we can be sure

02:02:02.774 --> 02:02:04.733
Do you understand?

02:02:05.902 --> 02:02:08.278
I— I can't marry you.

02:02:09.906 --> 02:02:12.825
- Because of my children.
- Oh, not because
of your children.

02:02:12.909 --> 02:02:14.827
They're sweet.

02:02:14.911 --> 02:02:18.163
It is their Polynesian
mother then—

02:02:18.248 --> 02:02:20.249
their mother and I.

02:02:24.421 --> 02:02:27.089
Yes.

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:29.174
I can't help it.

02:02:31.678 --> 02:02:34.847
I-It isn't as if I could
give you a good reason.

02:02:34.931 --> 02:02:37.975
I—
There is no reason.

02:02:39.686 --> 02:02:41.687
This is emotional.

02:02:44.858 --> 02:02:47.484
This is something
that's born in me.

02:02:47.569 --> 02:02:49.486
It is not.

02:02:49.571 --> 02:02:52.239
I do not believe
this is born in you.

02:02:52.323 --> 02:02:56.493
Well, then why— why do I
feel the way I do?

02:02:56.578 --> 02:03:00.122
All I— All I know is,
I— I can't help it.

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:03.125
I— I can't help it.

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:06.628
Joe? Joe, explain
how we feel.

02:03:06.713 --> 02:03:08.630
Joe!

02:03:12.552 --> 02:03:14.720
Nellie—
Bill! Bill!

02:03:14.846 --> 02:03:17.014
Nellie—
Bill?

02:03:17.098 --> 02:03:19.266
Can we go now?
Please?

02:03:37.327 --> 02:03:39.703
What makes her
talk like that?

02:03:40.914 --> 02:03:43.582
Why do you have
this feeling—
you and she?

02:03:43.666 --> 02:03:46.752
I do not believe
it is born in you!

02:03:46.836 --> 02:03:48.796
I do not believe it!

02:03:49.005 --> 02:03:52.091
It's not born in you!

02:03:52.175 --> 02:03:54.676
It happens
after you're born.

I used to go hunting.

around Marie Louise.

02:09:12.453 --> 02:09:14.496
Would you
reconsider...

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:17.249
going up there with me
to Marie Louise Island?

02:09:19.710 --> 02:09:24.381
I mean, now that
you haven't got
so much to lose?

02:09:27.885 --> 02:09:30.720
We could do a good job,
I think.

02:09:32.306 --> 02:09:34.224
You and I.

02:09:44.902 --> 02:09:47.654
How could a P.B.Y land
anywhere near that island...

02:09:47.738 --> 02:09:50.115
without being seen
by the enemy?

02:09:50.199 --> 02:09:52.868
It will not land
near the island,

02:09:52.952 --> 02:09:54.953
but far out at sea.

02:09:56.539 --> 02:10:00.792
I know the fishing grounds
my friends use,

02:10:00.877 --> 02:10:03.712
and I know
two fishermen there—

02:10:03.796 --> 02:10:06.298
Inato and Basil.

02:10:06.382 --> 02:10:08.383
They will help us.

02:10:12.263 --> 02:10:16.266
The equipment's
all aboard, sir. We loaded it
while it was still dark.

02:10:18.102 --> 02:10:21.146
You'd better wait
a while yet
before you take off.

02:10:21.230 --> 02:10:24.858
Above all, this must look
like a casual, routine flight.

02:10:30.406 --> 02:10:34.117
Well, there's still
plenty of time
to change your mind.

Yeah?
Are you we gonna need
the parachutes or not?

02:10:54.722 --> 02:10:57.307
No, it looks calm enough
for us to set down.

this airplane anyhow?

there's a hole
in this plane!

Lieutenant, everybody.

It's Luther.

What are you doing
on this plane? How'd you
get on here anyway?

02:12:09.046 --> 02:12:11.548
Well, I— I thought
maybe you might need
an extra man.

02:12:11.632 --> 02:12:13.925
Seemed like
an interesting project,
and I—

02:12:14.010 --> 02:12:16.511
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
You feeling sick or something?

02:12:16.596 --> 02:12:18.763
If you don't like the idea,
we'll just forget it.

02:12:18.848 --> 02:12:21.433
I'll go back
to the baggage compartment.
Just pretend you never saw me.

02:12:21.517 --> 02:12:24.019
- I'll kill him.
- Now, Lieutenant.

take this attitude, I wouldn't
have volunteered my services.

this character?

02:12:30.192 --> 02:12:33.069

court-martialed for this,

I'm gonna ride you
out of the navy!

this is a secret mission
of the utmost importance?

we've been sort of kicking
this thing around,

02:18:09.031 --> 02:18:11.491
and, well, we feel that Lu—
well, Billis here—

02:18:11.575 --> 02:18:14.576
down in that rubber boat
with all the airplanes
buzzing around him...

02:18:14.662 --> 02:18:16.663
caused sort of
a diversionary action.

02:18:16.746 --> 02:18:20.290
It made it a lot easier for us
to land Cable and the Frenchman
without being seen.

02:18:20.376 --> 02:18:23.169
In fact, it turned out
to be an awful lucky break
for us, sir.

02:18:23.253 --> 02:18:26.089
What do you want me to do,
give this guy
a gold medal?

02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:29.759
[Sighs]

02:18:29.843 --> 02:18:32.971
I don't want
no gold medal, Captain,

02:18:33.055 --> 02:18:37.392
but, uh, I could use
a little more, um, freedom,

02:18:37.476 --> 02:18:39.477
a little room
to swing around in,

02:18:39.561 --> 02:18:41.980
if you know what I mean,
if you get the picture.

02:18:42.064 --> 02:18:45.775
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

02:18:48.236 --> 02:18:50.697
Get the hell
out of here!

02:18:52.074 --> 02:18:55.075
[Emile On Radio]
Come in, Kennel.
Captain! Captain!

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:57.120
Kennel, come in.

02:18:57.204 --> 02:19:00.164
This is
the Frenchman.
Do you hear me?

02:19:00.249 --> 02:19:02.290
This is Kennel.
Go ahead, Frenchman.

02:19:02.376 --> 02:19:04.794
This is our first chance
to send news to you.

02:19:04.878 --> 02:19:07.338
We have made contact
with former friends
of mine.

02:19:07.423 --> 02:19:11.843
We have set up quarters
in a very nice hole in a rock.

02:19:11.927 --> 02:19:15.346
No room,
but a lovely view.

02:19:15.431 --> 02:19:18.016
We can see right down
into the bottleneck.

02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:20.018
First the weather.

02:19:20.102 --> 02:19:22.437
Rain clouds
over Bougainville,
the Treasuries,

02:19:22.521 --> 02:19:24.981
Choiseul,
New Georgia.

02:19:25.065 --> 02:19:28.692
We expect rain
in this region
from 9:00 to 2:00.

02:19:28.777 --> 02:19:30.986
[Cable]
0900 to 1400.

02:19:31.071 --> 02:19:33.448
Oh, my friend Joe
corrects me.

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:36.367
0900 to 1400.

02:19:38.202 --> 02:19:41.664
You must not expect from us
any regular communication.

02:19:41.749 --> 02:19:44.876
There are hundreds
of Japanese
in this region.

02:19:44.959 --> 02:19:47.920
It will be necessary
to constantly change
our quarters.

02:19:48.004 --> 02:19:50.506
And now, our
military expert Joe.

02:19:50.591 --> 02:19:54.052
[Cable]
All you navy, marine
and army pilots,

02:19:54.136 --> 02:19:56.888
write this down.

02:19:56.972 --> 02:20:00.683
Surface craft—
19 troop barges...

02:20:00.768 --> 02:20:04.562
headed down
the bottleneck,
speed about 11 knots.

02:20:04.646 --> 02:20:07.607
Ought to pass Banika...

02:20:07.691 --> 02:20:10.610
at about 2000 tonight,

02:20:10.694 --> 02:20:12.737
escorted by
heavy warships.

02:20:12.821 --> 02:20:14.739
As for aircraft,

02:20:14.823 --> 02:20:16.783
22 bombers, Betties—

02:20:16.909 --> 02:20:20.870
A bottle of beer says
I get the first strike!
went by at 0600,

02:20:20.954 --> 02:20:24.165
[Cheering]
headed south southwest.

02:20:24.291 --> 02:20:27.126
About time!
[Cable] There ought to be some
way to knock off a few of those.

02:20:27.211 --> 02:20:30.922
- Hey, wait for us!
- That's all for now.
Good luck.

02:20:57.157 --> 02:21:01.577
Two weeks?
Well, how can those guys
stick it out for two weeks?

02:21:01.662 --> 02:21:05.998
Yeah. Everybody thought
they'd be dead pigeons
in a couple of days.

02:21:07.918 --> 02:21:10.753
I tell you,
those two guys are doing us
a lot of good.

02:21:10.838 --> 02:21:13.631
That Frenchman
reported 40 bombers
north of Munda.

02:21:13.715 --> 02:21:16.717
We took off,
and 40 bombers right
on the nose— boom, boom.

02:21:16.802 --> 02:21:19.637
How do those guys
keep alive up there?
The enemy's all around.

02:21:19.721 --> 02:21:21.639
How do they do it?

02:21:21.723 --> 02:21:24.934
That Frenchman knows
these jungles around here
like the palm of his hand.

02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:28.312
He's a hunter, see?
All I know is, they changed
the whole setup here.

02:21:28.397 --> 02:21:30.898
I think
we got the Japanese
on the run.

02:21:30.983 --> 02:21:33.317
That's what
the Frenchman said.

02:21:33.402 --> 02:21:36.195
Well, is it my lead?
Yeah.

02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:39.407
Let me see.
Come on, come on.
I got money on this.

02:21:39.575 --> 02:21:43.536
[Emile]
Listen carefully, please.
Ceiling today unlimited.

02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:45.872
Thirty-three fighters,
Zeros,

02:21:45.956 --> 02:21:47.999
have moved in
from Bougainville.

02:21:48.083 --> 02:21:52.628
Their course
is approximately
0-2-3 degrees true.

02:21:52.713 --> 02:21:55.047
[Engines Droning]

02:21:55.132 --> 02:21:57.967
I'm certain
heavy bombers
will follow.

02:21:58.051 --> 02:22:00.887
I think something big
is afoot.

02:22:02.306 --> 02:22:04.223
That's all
I have time for now.

02:22:04.308 --> 02:22:06.809
Joe and I must change
our position immediately.

02:22:06.894 --> 02:22:08.853
Planes are
directly overhead.

02:22:08.937 --> 02:22:12.190
Two only, but they're
looking for us, I think.

02:22:12.274 --> 02:22:14.066
They know about
where we are.

02:22:14.151 --> 02:22:17.028
I will try to
get back to you later.
Good luck.

02:22:17.112 --> 02:22:20.615
They got us
pretty well pinpointed.
Stay here.

02:22:20.699 --> 02:22:24.035
In a few minutes,
it will be dark enough
to run for it.

02:22:25.787 --> 02:22:28.122
You know, I think
we're right.

02:22:28.207 --> 02:22:32.168
It looks like
they're going all out.
Even these planes.

02:22:32.252 --> 02:22:34.712
They've stopped
looking for us.
They're going away.

02:22:34.796 --> 02:22:37.298
Let's make
a run for it.

02:22:39.009 --> 02:22:41.010
All right. Let's go.

02:22:42.471 --> 02:22:45.473
[Machine Gun Fire]

02:22:47.351 --> 02:22:50.353
A-And we have
a lot of fighter pilots
over in the ward,

02:22:50.437 --> 02:22:54.065
and— and they keep talking
about a Frenchman.

02:22:54.149 --> 02:22:57.902
The Frenchman said this, and
the Frenchman said that, and—

02:22:57.986 --> 02:23:01.989
I was just wondering
if the Frenchman they're
talking about could be...

02:23:03.867 --> 02:23:05.826
my Frenchman.

02:23:07.162 --> 02:23:09.455
Yes, Miss Forbush,
it is.

02:23:09.539 --> 02:23:11.540
I couldn't tell you
before, but—

02:23:11.625 --> 02:23:14.835
Then he is
behind enemy lines.

02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:17.713
With Lieutenant Cable.

02:23:21.927 --> 02:23:25.972
Hello. This is Emile De Becque.
Please listen to me carefully.

02:23:26.056 --> 02:23:29.517
I haven't much time.

02:23:29.601 --> 02:23:33.604
My message today
must be brief and sad.

02:23:36.275 --> 02:23:38.901
Lieutenant Cable—

02:23:38.986 --> 02:23:40.945
my friend Joe—

02:23:41.029 --> 02:23:43.364
died a few minutes ago.

02:23:44.866 --> 02:23:47.368
I will never know
a finer man.

02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:51.956
I wish he could have
told you the news.

02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:54.417
The Japanese
are pulling out.

02:23:54.501 --> 02:23:57.461
There is
great confusion here.

02:23:57.546 --> 02:24:01.924
My guess is that the enemy
will try to evacuate troops
from Cape Esperance tonight.

02:24:02.009 --> 02:24:04.302
This is the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

02:24:04.386 --> 02:24:07.263
Make the most of it,
my friends.

02:24:07.389 --> 02:24:10.599
You may not hear from me again.
They are coming back.
[Engines Droning]

02:24:10.726 --> 02:24:12.643
They're right above me.
[Machine Gun Fire]

02:24:12.728 --> 02:24:16.480
- Good-bye!
- Is that all? Is that all?
Can't you get him back?

02:24:16.565 --> 02:24:19.942
Kennel to Frenchman.
Kennel to Frenchman.
Come in, Frenchman.

02:24:20.027 --> 02:24:21.986
I'm sorry, sir.
He's cut off.

02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:24.071
How far away.

02:24:25.741 --> 02:24:27.742
Philadelphia, P.A.

02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:31.495
Poor Joe Cable.

02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:35.249
Captain Brackett, do you think
there's a chance I'll ever see
Emile De Becque again?

02:24:35.334 --> 02:24:37.293
There's a chance.
Of course there's a chance.

02:24:37.419 --> 02:24:39.837
I didn't even know
he was going.
Of course not.

02:24:39.963 --> 02:24:42.965
How could he tell you?
Don't blame Emile De Becque.
He's okay.

02:24:43.050 --> 02:24:45.801
He's a wonderful guy.
Uh-huh.

02:24:45.886 --> 02:24:48.012
He has got a chance,
hasn't he, Bill?

02:24:48.096 --> 02:24:51.349
Of course.
There's always a chance.

02:25:29.596 --> 02:25:31.514
Emile?

02:25:37.521 --> 02:25:40.856
Emile, come back
so I can tell you something.

02:25:40.941 --> 02:25:43.651
I know what counts now.

02:25:43.735 --> 02:25:45.736
Just you.

02:25:45.821 --> 02:25:49.323
All those other things?
The woman you had before?

02:25:50.617 --> 02:25:52.743
Her color?

02:25:52.828 --> 02:25:55.955
What— What piffle. I—

02:25:56.039 --> 02:25:58.916
What a pinhead I was!

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.796
Come back so I can tell you.
Oh, don't die before
I can tell you.

02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:07.967
All that matters
is us being together.

02:26:08.051 --> 02:26:10.636
That's all.

02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:13.848
If you think of what
you said to me that day,

02:26:13.932 --> 02:26:15.933
you can stay alive, Emile.

02:26:16.017 --> 02:26:18.269
I know you can.

02:26:18.353 --> 02:26:20.688

Please.
Please, Miss Nurse.

Where is
Lootellan Cable?

02:27:21.917 --> 02:27:23.709
Who are you?

02:27:23.793 --> 02:27:26.504
I am mother of Liat.

02:27:26.588 --> 02:27:28.339
Who?

02:27:29.591 --> 02:27:31.842
Liat.

02:27:31.927 --> 02:27:34.428
She will marry no one
but Lootellan Cable.

02:27:38.099 --> 02:27:41.101
Oh. Oh, my darling.

02:27:48.944 --> 02:27:50.694
[Man On Speaker]
All right, hear this.

02:27:50.779 --> 02:27:54.031
All those outfits
that are waiting for loading,
please keep in position.

02:27:54.115 --> 02:27:56.075
We'll be loading
immediately.

02:27:56.159 --> 02:27:58.661
Hey, Billis.
Let's head back, huh?

02:27:58.745 --> 02:28:02.331
Our outfit's about
a mile back down the beach.
Suppose they call our names.

02:28:02.457 --> 02:28:06.627
Yeah, they may be ready
for us to board the ship.
They won't be ready for hours.

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:08.712
This is the navy!

02:28:08.797 --> 02:28:12.591
Huh. Look at that beach,
swarming with eager beavers.

02:28:12.676 --> 02:28:14.593
10,000 guys.

02:28:14.678 --> 02:28:18.681
All right, you men.
Stay down there with your own
unit where you belong!

02:28:18.765 --> 02:28:21.392
You Seabees, you belong
down the beach this way.

02:28:21.476 --> 02:28:24.645
Excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where I can
find Captain Brackett, sir?

02:28:24.771 --> 02:28:28.107
Down the beach this way.
Thank you, sir.
That's all.

02:28:30.026 --> 02:28:33.195
I beg your pardon, sir.
Can I speak to you
a moment, sir?

02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:35.239
Who is it?
Billis, sir.

02:28:35.323 --> 02:28:37.575
Luther Billis.
Yes, Billis.
What is it?

02:28:37.659 --> 02:28:39.994
We're moving out now.
I know, sir.

02:28:40.078 --> 02:28:42.079
Stewpot, the Professor
and me was wondering...

02:28:42.163 --> 02:28:45.374
if anything is being done
about rescuing the Frenchman
off that island.

02:28:45.458 --> 02:28:47.418
We hereby volunteer
for such a project.

02:28:47.502 --> 02:28:51.380
A triple diversionary activity
like I done to get him on there.

02:28:51.464 --> 02:28:54.425
You could, uh—
You could drop us
in three rubber boats...

02:28:54.509 --> 02:28:56.510
on three different sides
of the island.

02:28:56.595 --> 02:28:59.388
Confuse them
out of their minds!

02:28:59.472 --> 02:29:01.515
Get the picture?

02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:04.101
That's very fine, Billis,
but you're too late.

02:29:04.185 --> 02:29:06.145
Operation Alligator
is under way.

02:29:06.229 --> 02:29:09.982
Landings were made on a bunch of
Japanese-held islands during the
night and early this morning.

02:29:10.066 --> 02:29:12.276
Mary Louise Island
was the first one they hit.

02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:15.112
How about
that Frenchman?
Did they get him?

02:29:15.196 --> 02:29:17.448
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

02:29:17.532 --> 02:29:20.367
Lieutenant Buzz Adams
flew up there to find out.

02:29:20.452 --> 02:29:23.954
But it would be just too bad
if a part of this huge operation
couldn't have saved...

02:29:24.039 --> 02:29:27.249
one of the two guys
who made it all possible.

02:29:33.715 --> 02:29:36.050
The big ones
are battleships.

02:29:36.134 --> 02:29:39.136
And the little ones
are, uh, destroyers.

02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:41.680
They're moving out,
you see, because—

02:29:41.765 --> 02:29:44.433
well, there's been
a big change.

02:29:44.517 --> 02:29:46.894
They won't be around
here much anymore.

02:29:46.978 --> 02:29:49.730
Just off and on,
a few of us.

02:29:51.733 --> 02:29:54.652
Did you understand
anything I said?

02:29:54.736 --> 02:29:57.821
[Sighs]
Vous ne comprenez pas?

02:29:57.906 --> 02:29:59.823
Oui, oui.
Nous comprenons.

02:29:59.908 --> 02:30:01.825
Oui.

02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:04.286
Now, while I'm down
at the hospital,

02:30:04.371 --> 02:30:07.581
you've got to promise me
to mangez everything—

02:30:07.666 --> 02:30:10.584
everything that's put
before you on the table.

02:30:10.669 --> 02:30:13.629
Sur la table.

02:30:13.713 --> 02:30:16.131
Sur "le" table?

02:30:16.216 --> 02:30:18.175
Sur la table.

02:30:18.259 --> 02:30:21.053
Oh. Sur la table.

02:30:21.137 --> 02:30:23.097
Merci.

02:30:23.181 --> 02:30:26.183
Jerome! Come back here
and sit down.

02:30:41.783 --> 02:30:44.076
Asseyez-vous!

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:48.831
Now, you have to learn to
mind me when I talk to you
and be nice to me too...

02:30:51.292 --> 02:30:54.002
because I love you
very much.

02:30:55.463 --> 02:30:57.423
Je t'aime.
[Chuckles]

02:30:57.507 --> 02:31:00.008
Je vous aime.

02:31:00.093 --> 02:31:02.010
Now, mangez.

02:31:05.515 --> 02:31:09.351
Chantez, Nellie.
Mmm. I will not
sing that song.

02:31:09.436 --> 02:31:11.770
You just want to laugh
at my French accent.

02:31:17.777 --> 02:31:21.029
All right.
But you gotta help me.
