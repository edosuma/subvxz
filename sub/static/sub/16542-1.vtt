02:59.277 --> 03:01.457
Oh God, not again.

03:19.996 --> 03:21.369
Why do you think you're here?

03:24.376 --> 03:25.606
Donald.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.605
Why do you think you're here?

03:30.529 --> 03:31.700
Me thinkin'.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.749
What are you thinking about?

03:34.768 --> 03:36.268
Hmm?

03:37.934 --> 03:39.034
Come on...

03:39.847 --> 03:41.077
what are you feeling?

03:43.114 --> 03:45.424
- Sometimes we can be so...
- What time is it?

03:46.313 --> 03:48.456
Don't worry. Plenty of time.

03:50.933 --> 03:52.365
Are you...?

03:52.589 --> 03:53.777
Are you leaving?

03:53.778 --> 03:55.779
Yeah, I have to get nuked.

04:24.623 --> 04:27.940
All of these sick little boys...

04:28.560 --> 04:32.885
Oh, they all need my
attention, don't they?

04:32.966 --> 04:35.418
Now, where did I put
my thermometer?

04:36.522 --> 04:38.722
Uh-oh.

04:39.293 --> 04:42.587
Somebody's lost all his hair.

04:44.602 --> 04:46.627
Ohh...

04:46.628 --> 04:50.087
poor little sad baldy-boy.

04:55.136 --> 04:57.161
Hmmm.

04:57.162 --> 05:00.479
I've waited so long for this day.

05:01.229 --> 05:02.460
Show time!

05:08.530 --> 05:10.684
You don't look so hot.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.960
So many ways to die.

05:13.744 --> 05:15.924
So little time.

05:21.149 --> 05:23.130
So Jeff got in this morning.

05:23.131 --> 05:25.215
He's a bit jet-lagged, but
he's dying to see you.

05:25.216 --> 05:26.447
Yeah, he can't wait.

05:28.832 --> 05:31.348
Oh, I put you down for
higher level maths.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.547
Mr. Duggan reckons you're bright enough.

05:34.429 --> 05:35.610
I think you're well capable.

05:35.611 --> 05:37.754
Oh, and you need to
try on your new...

05:42.842 --> 05:44.503
They're marathon girls, man.

05:45.309 --> 05:49.218
None of this Catholic guilt shit,
they're up for it, you know.

05:49.835 --> 05:52.445
Oh, I gotta live there.
I gotta live there, definitely.

05:54.384 --> 05:56.491
Best sex I ever had in my life.

05:57.408 --> 05:59.632
- What about Joanna?
- No, she's not bi.

05:59.633 --> 06:02.855
- No, I mean are you still going out with her?
- Yeah.

06:05.786 --> 06:07.053
You dirty dog.

06:12.113 --> 06:16.509
I, uh... I hear you're gettin' lifts
home off the Gardes these days.

06:19.344 --> 06:20.575
You gotta stop all that.

06:22.273 --> 06:24.133
You're drivin' Mom crazy, Don.

06:28.626 --> 06:30.877
Eh, she falls asleep there most nights.

06:31.755 --> 06:33.970
She's practically a
professor of cancer now.

06:36.934 --> 06:39.386
And have you heard about Dad
turnin' to God?

06:40.203 --> 06:43.555
- No way!
- Yeah, he sneaks off to mass on Sunday.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.964
Think he's tryin' to make some type
of deal with God or something.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.609
No, I can't blame him.

06:50.182 --> 06:52.416
Not meant to die before
our parents, are we?

06:54.734 --> 06:55.869
Sorry.

06:58.401 --> 07:00.017
Oh, there was this one chick,

07:00.018 --> 07:03.180
she's 25, ballerina, she moved
down for the summer, right?

07:03.181 --> 07:06.120
So she was exactly the same as us and
she had around five mates with her,

07:06.121 --> 07:07.821
and they all lived there in one...

07:13.094 --> 07:14.962
Help! Help!

07:14.963 --> 07:16.669
Oh, my God. Help me!

07:16.670 --> 07:18.720
Oh my God, quick! Hurry!

07:18.721 --> 07:20.971
Oh, please, please help me!

07:24.005 --> 07:26.160
You saved my life.

07:26.161 --> 07:28.165
What do you look Like
underneath that...

07:28.166 --> 07:30.366
[Screams]

07:31.376 --> 07:33.826
So, you wanna make love?

07:34.320 --> 07:36.345
Oh,

07:36.346 --> 07:37.473
oh, please.

07:37.474 --> 07:39.674
Pretty please?

07:54.146 --> 07:55.258
Are you stoned?

07:55.259 --> 07:56.335
- No.
- Are you smokin' dope?

07:56.336 --> 07:59.012
- No!
- I'm not an idiot, Donald. I can smell it!

07:59.013 --> 08:00.107
I'm not...

08:00.403 --> 08:01.574
What's goin' on?

08:01.986 --> 08:04.295
Mom! Can you get out. Get out!

08:04.645 --> 08:06.895
This is my room, get out. Out!

08:15.943 --> 08:17.245
He's very angry.

08:20.149 --> 08:22.494
We're just afraid he's
gonna do somethin'...

08:23.174 --> 08:25.625
stupid, or harm himself.

08:27.415 --> 08:28.646
Of course, he's angry.

08:30.578 --> 08:31.809
Wouldn't you be angry?

08:32.837 --> 08:36.466
Thing is, it's he's seen everyone in Tupholme,
you know, he's seen every psychologist, so he won't...

08:36.467 --> 08:38.678
- You see, he won't... he won't let anybody in.
- We don't know what to do.

08:39.929 --> 08:44.230
- And, and he will not talk. Not to us, not to anyone.
- Not to me.

08:45.353 --> 08:47.496
I read your book on art therapy.

08:48.448 --> 08:52.368
I think you could really... just connect with him and...

08:52.369 --> 08:55.210
This is all he's interested in,
is drawing, just drawing.

08:55.211 --> 08:57.387
Spend hours in his room, doin' that.

08:57.660 --> 08:58.867
He's a good boy.

09:42.970 --> 09:46.661
Ah, here we are. Shelly Fitzgerald,
I have you down in 4C.

09:46.662 --> 09:47.858
It's O'Riley.

09:47.859 --> 09:49.805
Oh, they have you down here as Fitzgerald.

09:49.806 --> 09:54.036
I don't go by that name. But don't stress it,
I won't be long here anyway.

10:56.987 --> 11:01.240
So you're the hero,
grabbing all the headlines.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.738
Well, let me introduce myself.

11:06.547 --> 11:08.690
They call me...

11:09.607 --> 11:10.874
The Glove.

11:12.909 --> 11:15.918
You've heard of
the circle of life,

11:16.802 --> 11:19.165
well this is the
circle of death!

11:19.166 --> 11:21.132
Do you know who I am?

11:23.234 --> 11:24.536
Shrink number 6?

11:25.285 --> 11:27.107
Do you do Greek at school?

11:28.344 --> 11:29.515
No.

11:31.403 --> 11:34.696
The Greek word for "death" is <i>thanatos</i>.

11:42.168 --> 11:44.979
I'm a thanatologist.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.270
Doctor Death?

11:49.272 --> 11:53.184
Sometimes I can help people if they're...
afraid of dying.

11:53.304 --> 11:54.512
I'm not afraid.

11:55.356 --> 11:56.563
Oh, excellent.

12:02.726 --> 12:05.204
So, are you gonna ask
me any more questions?

12:06.932 --> 12:09.207
Well, I mean, uh...

12:13.155 --> 12:14.979
Do you feel well?

12:18.335 --> 12:21.232
Look, I'm here because me parents are
just a bit freaked out, that's all.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.823
Why is that, you think?

12:25.635 --> 12:28.095
Mom says I'm not fightin' the disease.

12:28.096 --> 12:29.705
Is that true?

12:30.349 --> 12:33.301
What's the point?
I'm not gonna win, am I?

12:34.152 --> 12:36.260
Well, nobody's gonna win.

12:37.247 --> 12:39.179
You're right there.

12:40.167 --> 12:43.547
Always, death wins.

12:58.789 --> 13:00.635
These are pretty crappy paintings, you know.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.936
That's right, your mother said
you were a bit of an artist.

13:03.146 --> 13:07.192
Yeah, but more this century sort of stuff.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.558
Like what?

13:10.516 --> 13:11.818
That wouldn't be your bag.

13:16.738 --> 13:17.969
Wait, well...

13:18.686 --> 13:19.901
I've gotta go, so...

13:19.902 --> 13:22.010
Alright.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.365
Oh...

13:30.366 --> 13:33.039
are you going to commit suicide?

13:34.434 --> 13:35.641
Do you think.

13:37.926 --> 13:41.077
Your parents said you've
already given it a go.

13:42.707 --> 13:44.958
- Yeah, I have.
- Right.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.169
Well, let's not make another appointment.

13:52.025 --> 13:53.924
The place smells of soup.

14:49.454 --> 14:51.705
Don. What is this?

14:52.687 --> 14:54.997
Go on, try some.
It's good.

15:06.018 --> 15:09.218
Oh, God, that's
actually so disgusting.

15:09.305 --> 15:11.216
- It's wheat grass.
- Wheat grass?

15:11.217 --> 15:12.397
- Yeah.
- What's that?

15:12.398 --> 15:13.629
I don't... I don't even know.

15:14.346 --> 15:15.825
Mallow rat!

15:18.691 --> 15:21.558
Don, what happened to your eyebrows?

15:22.724 --> 15:24.026
Shut up, Michael.

15:24.879 --> 15:26.805
How are you keepin', Don?

15:27.869 --> 15:30.144
- No, I'm good.
- I think it's cool.

15:30.198 --> 15:32.306
The eyebrows, it's kinda X-Men.

15:33.118 --> 15:35.238
- You know, that guy with the...
- Yeah.

15:35.239 --> 15:38.497
- Hi, Hugo.
- Hey, how you doin'?

15:53.004 --> 15:57.364
To speak, or not to speak.
That is the question.

15:58.114 --> 16:02.315
Or, more pertinently perhaps,
that is the dilemma,

16:02.320 --> 16:05.552
each and every one of
us must grapple with,

16:05.553 --> 16:08.776
if we fear the truth will wound.

16:09.795 --> 16:14.938
To quote professor Milton Eames again,
and in conclusion,

16:14.939 --> 16:19.365
stay silent and the truth
will stay silent with you.

16:20.084 --> 16:24.587
Speak low if you lack the
strength, but speak.

16:25.438 --> 16:29.704
And give not these lies of silence victory.

16:31.972 --> 16:35.324
Um, very good, Miss Fitzgerald.
Excellent.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.908
Surprisingly intelligent.

16:38.753 --> 16:40.020
It's O'Riley.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.951
Mmm.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.462
Walk slowly!

16:48.174 --> 16:51.305
Remember, feet not hooves.

17:02.810 --> 17:04.317
Nice essay.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.367
I'll see you later.

18:35.664 --> 18:39.965
Okay, Donald, I'm gonna be direct with you.
To save time.

18:41.783 --> 18:42.991
Why are you here?

18:43.799 --> 18:46.044
It proves I'm legitimately mental.

18:47.068 --> 18:49.140
So the cops have to leave me alone.

18:50.006 --> 18:51.538
Okay, so it's in your interests then.

18:51.539 --> 18:55.340
- Yeah.
- Great! Let's get cracking, shall we?

18:55.341 --> 18:56.549
Yeah.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.815
Let's do...

19:01.737 --> 19:03.739
the shrinky thing.

19:06.216 --> 19:07.891
Do you want to live?

19:15.087 --> 19:16.222
Life...

19:16.269 --> 19:19.049
is a sexually transmitted disease.

19:19.363 --> 19:22.068
It's spread by people having sex.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.572
And then in the end it kills you.

19:26.593 --> 19:27.801
Who said that?

19:29.584 --> 19:32.000
Was it, uh, was it The Glove?

19:34.798 --> 19:37.285
You are very, very talented.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.428
Stupid bastards! That is mine,
they had no right to give you that.

19:45.366 --> 19:47.875
And how would you like it if
someone came into your house,

19:47.876 --> 19:51.005
and started lookin' at all
your weird private stuff, huh?

20:33.306 --> 20:35.085
Would you like something to eat?

20:37.443 --> 20:40.701
Even for a superhero, he's...
he's pretty cool, isn't he?

20:41.584 --> 20:43.656
But, why doesn't he ever say anything?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.887
The women go crazy for him.

20:48.576 --> 20:50.826
Well, why is he so
depressed all the time?

20:52.009 --> 20:53.947
'Cause he can't get laid.

20:54.545 --> 20:55.776
Yeah, but...

20:55.777 --> 20:59.865
- but women are throwing themselves at him.
- I know, it's so messed up.

21:03.212 --> 21:05.151
Well, why can't he have a girlfriend?

21:06.575 --> 21:10.688
'Cause he's a superhero, isn't he?
He's too busy saving people.

21:13.741 --> 21:16.700
Donald, what were you thinking
when you were standing up on the bridge?

21:19.125 --> 21:21.790
I'm not gonna die
like some old lady.

21:22.254 --> 21:24.397
Is that how you plan to do it then?

21:25.732 --> 21:27.263
Jump off a bridge?

21:27.330 --> 21:31.299
Who cares?
OD, jump, or somethin'.

21:31.606 --> 21:32.886
Well, I care.

21:32.887 --> 21:36.380
Well, you shouldn't. It's my life, it's my call.
It shouldn't concern you.

21:36.381 --> 21:38.166
Yeah, but if I was the one who found you,

21:38.167 --> 21:41.061
fellow human being lying in the street, dead,

21:41.062 --> 21:42.269
broken,

21:43.982 --> 21:46.921
I think it would take a long time to
get that image out of my head.

21:47.284 --> 21:49.031
Yeah, but that would be your problem.

21:49.301 --> 21:51.646
Yeah. Yeah, it really would.

22:32.025 --> 22:34.168
Why do you give them tails?

22:35.120 --> 22:38.342
- What?
- Those women in your drawings.

22:38.387 --> 22:41.285
Are they meant to be some sort of devils?

22:41.307 --> 22:42.469
No. No, they're...

22:42.470 --> 22:44.539
um...

22:44.540 --> 22:46.956
no, they're just stupid doodles, that's all.

22:47.705 --> 22:49.884
Are they the kind of girls you like?

22:49.929 --> 22:52.072
Sluts with big tits?

22:56.117 --> 22:58.332
I think I'll go home after this.

22:59.072 --> 23:02.330
Another dose of Chemistry. Please!

23:02.340 --> 23:07.278
Like anyone in the real world's
ever asked me what a molecule is.

23:09.536 --> 23:13.837
So what are you into?
Besides drawing.

23:14.611 --> 23:16.823
- Umm...
- I'd say you're into writing.

23:16.871 --> 23:19.503
Like, you seem like you're
in your head a lot.

23:19.504 --> 23:23.496
- No. No, not really.
- Well, I'm the opposite.

23:23.622 --> 23:25.885
Blurt stuff out all the time.

23:26.048 --> 23:30.135
If somebody doesn't like it, that's fine, that's me.
What can you do?

23:31.507 --> 23:33.782
Alright. Well, I'm off.

23:37.591 --> 23:38.964
Good luck with your porn.

23:39.641 --> 23:41.285
No. No, it's not porn.

23:55.529 --> 23:56.759
Will you stop moving.

23:57.580 --> 24:00.696
I didn't.
Hurry up, anyway.

24:03.664 --> 24:04.776
Morning, Billy.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.027
Donald, can you come with me?
Your folks are here.

24:10.130 --> 24:12.202
See you later, sick boy.

24:15.475 --> 24:18.534
Well, the white cell count is stable.

24:18.535 --> 24:20.880
There's been no further deterioration, so...

24:21.324 --> 24:24.597
you'll be very glad to hear, Donald, we
can at least get rid of that Hickman.

24:25.704 --> 24:29.314
- So that's good, right?
- Yes, the radiation is really helping.

24:32.057 --> 24:35.244
Well that's... I mean, we just...
just keep it up.

24:36.264 --> 24:37.645
Keep fightin' the fight.

24:37.646 --> 24:38.906
- Jeff!
- Yeah.

24:38.907 --> 24:40.877
- Remind me to get some petrol, too.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:40.878 --> 24:41.863
Here you go...

24:41.864 --> 24:44.138
get some pizzas, DVDs, get a few beers.
- Alright.

24:44.502 --> 24:47.270
- No, don't... No, don't get beers.
- Get a few beers!

24:47.271 --> 24:49.415
- He's in remission, we're celebrating.
- Don't get beer.

24:49.416 --> 24:50.897
That's not enough.

24:51.803 --> 24:54.062
- You guys kill me. That's it.
- Thank you.

24:54.063 --> 24:57.045
- Come on, we're gonna be late.
- See you, players. Good luck, guys.

24:57.046 --> 25:01.347
Thank you, and, and, listen, um...
just one, um, beer for Donald.

25:05.326 --> 25:07.620
So, eh, Jo... what are you doin' in college?

25:07.621 --> 25:10.482
- English and Sociology.
- Oh.

25:10.645 --> 25:14.220
The old man wants me to do law
but that's just... not happening.

25:14.274 --> 25:16.761
- I couldn't hack a nine-to-five job.
- I'm not gonna go to college.

25:17.042 --> 25:20.062
- You wouldn't get in, Michael.
- I would, I just don't want to.

25:20.063 --> 25:22.263
I'm gonna take a year off, slow down.

25:23.091 --> 25:24.428
What about you, Donald?

25:25.212 --> 25:26.479
What are you gonna study?

25:27.367 --> 25:28.634
Thanatology.

25:31.365 --> 25:33.675
Oh yeah. Cool.

25:34.668 --> 25:36.183
- Alright, lads?
- Yeah.

25:36.184 --> 25:38.229
- Are you coming?
- Alright.

25:38.230 --> 25:39.475
See you's later, yeah?

25:39.639 --> 25:42.622
What's this? Ach! Can we
come and watch?

25:46.140 --> 25:49.232
The legs on her, man.
Serious piece of work.

25:49.233 --> 25:50.648
That was pretty clever.

25:50.649 --> 25:51.981
What's... what's thanatology?

25:51.982 --> 25:54.182
Yeah, what is thanatology?
Where is that from?

26:04.913 --> 26:07.992
- Well?
- No, it definitely needs more alcohol.

26:11.065 --> 26:12.332
This is a bad idea.

26:14.253 --> 26:17.765
Did I, uh... did I tell you about Hugo?

26:19.478 --> 26:20.686
Popped his cherry.

26:21.460 --> 26:22.560
What?

26:22.573 --> 26:26.483
- It means that he's no longer a virgin.
- Yeah, I know what it means. Is that true, Hugo?

26:26.536 --> 26:29.149
- What?
- Michael said you popped your cherry.

26:29.769 --> 26:31.888
Yeah. The weekend, yeah.

26:31.889 --> 26:34.139
- With who?
- Who do you think?

26:35.657 --> 26:38.532
- Sharon.
- Really?

26:38.851 --> 26:43.849
- Yeah. It's no big deal, like.
- So, I mean, what was it like?

26:44.300 --> 26:47.602
Oh, she's filthy, man. She's wild.

26:47.603 --> 26:51.998
Seriously, she does... she does anything,
everything and anything. She's nuts.

26:53.790 --> 26:54.998
What? Like what?

26:55.876 --> 26:57.107
Give us the details.

26:59.039 --> 27:01.729
I'm not givin' you details, you creep.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.340
Where are them drinks, Michael?

27:07.314 --> 27:09.938
Get up! Get up, get up, get up!
I'm gonna go get mine!

27:11.382 --> 27:12.826
- Joanna.
- What is it?

27:52.993 --> 27:55.338
I've been waiting for you.

27:56.331 --> 27:58.511
What took you so long?

28:09.750 --> 28:11.123
Let's do it.

29:01.502 --> 29:05.732
- I'm the one with cancer.
- Yeah, and you're gettin' better. Okay?

29:09.096 --> 29:10.889
He's been suspended a week.

29:11.318 --> 29:14.706
- That's if I live that long.
- Don't talk like... why are you talking like that?

29:16.636 --> 29:20.796
- So ground me.
- You're in remission, okay?

29:21.573 --> 29:24.385
And you've got a big
important year ahead.

29:24.386 --> 29:27.147
You've got your exams, you've got...
I wanna organize that trip to France

29:27.148 --> 29:28.839
and I'm not gonna be able
to do that for you...

29:28.840 --> 29:31.612
if you don't get your head in the right place.
- Mom, look at me. Look!

29:31.672 --> 29:32.994
Look at me.

29:33.588 --> 29:36.272
Nothing is gonna change the
fact that I am fucked!

29:37.794 --> 29:40.837
Now can I please just have a
little bit of fun before I check out?

29:40.838 --> 29:42.910
Is that too much to ask for?

29:45.164 --> 29:47.469
No one is sayin' you
can't have fun, son.

29:48.327 --> 29:50.024
No one's saying that.

29:54.446 --> 29:55.854
Mom, don't.

29:56.706 --> 29:58.114
Please don't.

29:58.757 --> 30:01.780
- Jesus, can you just stop it with the tears all the time?
- I'm not... doing...

30:01.781 --> 30:04.344
- Don. Don, will you calm down?
- This is the nightmare that I have to live with...

30:04.345 --> 30:07.025
- Don, please, will you calm down?
- I'm sorry if I'm getting upset about...

30:07.026 --> 30:08.536
It's all right. It's all right, it's all right.

30:08.537 --> 30:10.054
- Mom, you're wrecking with my head!
- Don.

30:10.055 --> 30:11.167
- Just get out.
- Don.

30:11.168 --> 30:13.185
- Please, can you just get out?
- Calm down, son.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.041
- Dad, can you take her home?
- Son, we love you. We...

30:15.042 --> 30:17.257
- Stop this! Fuck it!
- Don!

30:38.318 --> 30:40.296
Anybody home?

30:44.541 --> 30:46.323
Well, that went well.

30:51.693 --> 30:56.536
They fuck you up, your mom and dad.
They may not mean to, but they do.

30:56.986 --> 30:59.086
- You're not in pain?
- No.

31:01.158 --> 31:04.968
They don't get it. They don't understand.
It was just a piece of graffiti.

31:05.075 --> 31:08.119
And who really cares?
I don't give a shit!

31:15.295 --> 31:16.934
Is that it?

31:17.589 --> 31:19.281
Is that the...

31:20.636 --> 31:22.955
the full extent of the...

31:23.025 --> 31:26.613
Donald armory? The
full "rage" is it?

31:30.430 --> 31:33.289
You know, I mean, if
I get angry I can...

31:33.389 --> 31:36.456
I can really...
tank it, you know?

31:38.973 --> 31:42.678
I'd really like to see you get angry.
I mean really angry.

31:43.015 --> 31:44.617
Go on, show me.

31:45.935 --> 31:48.833
Show me what you can do, Donald.

31:51.966 --> 31:53.203
Go on.

31:53.204 --> 31:57.433
Let's see the full fire of Donald.

31:57.434 --> 31:59.134
Raaww!

32:02.189 --> 32:06.831
That was terrible. Do it again.
Come on. Really, really... agh!

32:07.556 --> 32:09.443
Go on. Go on!

32:09.582 --> 32:11.217
Go on, you can do it.

32:11.425 --> 32:12.881
Go on!

32:23.799 --> 32:25.693
Kind of...

32:58.165 --> 33:01.058
How come you miss so
many days of school?

33:02.407 --> 33:04.444
Hospital stuff.

33:06.440 --> 33:09.411
Handy excuse when you don't
have your homework done.

33:13.058 --> 33:16.811
I sat the Junior Cert last year.
It's a doddle, seriously.

33:16.812 --> 33:18.467
Don't sweat it.

33:19.059 --> 33:21.040
So why're you repeatin' then?

33:21.041 --> 33:22.379
I failed most of it.

33:23.057 --> 33:24.793
And I got expelled.

33:28.855 --> 33:32.167
- Ah, no, you're grand. I'll do it, it's fine.
- I've nothing better to do.

33:33.413 --> 33:34.732
Okay.

33:34.733 --> 33:37.956
I just couldn't be bothered
with the whole thing, you know?

33:38.701 --> 33:40.749
Who gives a shit, really?

33:40.787 --> 33:43.061
Whole exam thing is beyond ridics.

33:44.054 --> 33:45.261
I know.

33:50.103 --> 33:51.866
So how long have you been sick?

33:54.310 --> 33:55.818
Um, just over a year.

33:56.604 --> 33:57.940
Sucks.

33:59.091 --> 34:00.524
Yeah.

34:03.765 --> 34:05.908
What color was your hair, anyway?

34:06.860 --> 34:08.067
Sorry?

34:09.119 --> 34:12.235
Tryin' to imagine what
you were like before.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.341
I don't know, it was dark.

34:19.304 --> 34:24.053
- So, is the hair loss permanent?
- No, no, it's just while I'm in treatment, you know.

34:25.393 --> 34:26.708
I like it.

34:26.710 --> 34:28.340
It's edgy.

34:37.174 --> 34:40.431
So, um, who's the guy on the motorbike?

34:42.422 --> 34:43.559
Why?

34:44.438 --> 34:46.484
Are you jealous?

34:58.720 --> 35:00.199
There you go.

35:00.419 --> 35:02.405
- Take it. It's carrot juice.
- I don't want carrot juice.

35:02.406 --> 35:04.661
There's orange in it. It's nice.

35:05.124 --> 35:07.347
- Do you want any?
- Coke.

35:07.846 --> 35:09.260
A Diet for Jo.

35:09.261 --> 35:10.491
- Please.
- Please.

35:11.555 --> 35:14.564
Hey. Hey!

35:14.891 --> 35:17.275
Have you read
this stuff?

35:17.604 --> 35:20.594
It's your mom who needs the shrink.

35:20.768 --> 35:23.881
She thinks you're gonna
get out of this alive.

36:26.437 --> 36:27.645
Oh, Jesus.

36:29.532 --> 36:30.940
Well, thanks Dr. King, that's, uh...

36:31.826 --> 36:34.672
that's really professional.
- Well...

36:34.815 --> 36:36.117
do you want to start talking?

36:39.925 --> 36:43.673
Blah, blah, blah. Cancer. Cancer. Blah, blah.
- Right.

36:43.674 --> 36:45.304
You don't wanna do any work.

36:49.162 --> 36:51.057
I've got my own things to do.

36:55.709 --> 36:57.606
You can let yourself out.

37:13.269 --> 37:14.704
Fine.

37:46.638 --> 37:47.809
Who is she?

37:51.887 --> 37:53.260
That's my wife, Sophie.

37:54.912 --> 37:56.179
I thought you were gay.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.320
Why would you think that?

38:01.343 --> 38:03.486
Just a vibe.
No offense.

38:08.470 --> 38:10.149
So, is she a shrink too?

38:13.371 --> 38:15.372
No, she's dead.

38:27.551 --> 38:29.036
I went to your school.

38:30.039 --> 38:31.846
To see your graffiti.

38:33.744 --> 38:34.951
So what do you think?

38:36.837 --> 38:38.838
Well, it wouldn't be my bag.

38:46.119 --> 38:47.586
I want to show you something.

38:50.256 --> 38:51.392
Here it is.

38:55.610 --> 38:57.611
So, this is...

38:58.670 --> 39:00.885
This is called a pieta.

39:01.659 --> 39:03.933
It's a really important thing in art.

39:06.672 --> 39:09.572
Oh, this is terrible. I've actually
done a better one somewhere.

39:09.603 --> 39:11.621
I'm not really into religious type of stuff.

39:11.721 --> 39:13.558
Well, no, neither am I.

39:17.268 --> 39:22.174
So... why Mary and Jesus,
or whoever that is?

39:23.664 --> 39:24.895
Well, because...

39:25.820 --> 39:27.928
I get the feeling
it's bigger than that.

39:29.887 --> 39:32.202
I mean, I've never managed
to pull it off, but

39:32.612 --> 39:34.643
to capture that essence,

39:35.102 --> 39:37.210
and emotion,

39:37.292 --> 39:42.006
with clarity and a few simple strokes.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.658
Not everyone can do that.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.419
Takes a special kind of talent.

39:49.129 --> 39:51.213
Thing is, Donald, that's what you've got.

39:53.979 --> 39:55.767
You were here.

39:57.872 --> 40:02.592
Whether it 'tis nobler in the mind to
suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

40:02.792 --> 40:07.105
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and, by opposing, end them.

40:07.305 --> 40:10.285
To die, to sleep, no more,

40:10.561 --> 40:14.922
and by a sleep to say we end the heartache
and the thousand natural shocks

40:15.602 --> 40:19.981
that flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation...

40:19.982 --> 40:23.275
- Devout.
- ...devoutly to be wished.

40:23.981 --> 40:27.476
To die, to sleep, to sleep
perchance to dream.

40:28.117 --> 40:29.726
Aye, there's the rub.

40:31.212 --> 40:32.532
For in that sleep of death,

40:32.533 --> 40:36.668
what dreams may come, when we have
shuffled off this mortal coil,

40:36.669 --> 40:38.812
must give us pause.

40:42.892 --> 40:45.107
- Carry on.
- There's the respect

40:45.777 --> 40:48.264
that makes calamity
of so long life,

40:49.150 --> 40:55.065
for who would bear the whips and
scorns of time... that op... the oppressor

40:55.592 --> 40:58.643
The oppressor's. Oppress.

40:58.670 --> 41:00.707
The oppressor's.

41:01.630 --> 41:05.869
The oppressor's wrong, uh, the man...

41:05.894 --> 41:07.894
- Yeah.
- Quiet!

41:07.957 --> 41:11.144
- Miss Fitzgerald.
- It's O'Riley.

41:12.928 --> 41:16.424
The pangs of despised love,
the law's delay...

41:26.521 --> 41:27.692
Hi.

41:28.642 --> 41:29.823
How was school?

41:29.824 --> 41:31.908
- It was pretty good, actually.
- Yeah?

41:31.909 --> 41:34.124
- Yeah, what's that?
- Oh, chocolate cake.

41:35.004 --> 41:36.139
Chocolate cake.

41:41.192 --> 41:44.642
- That's not chocolate cake.
- Yeah, it is... well, it's carob, but it's the same.

41:44.742 --> 41:46.358
- Apparently.
- It's not the same.

41:46.372 --> 41:47.414
- No?
- No.

41:47.415 --> 41:51.739
More sugar, I think... just...
put some more sugar in there.

41:55.827 --> 41:57.899
It's gonna be okay, Mom.

41:58.782 --> 42:00.084
It's gonna be okay.

42:03.127 --> 42:05.212
Okay. Yeah.

42:05.213 --> 42:07.321
Come on, hug over.

42:11.297 --> 42:12.634
Thanks.

42:13.592 --> 42:15.629
More sugar.

42:30.209 --> 42:32.281
Careful!

43:37.859 --> 43:40.002
Is it Tuesday?

43:42.101 --> 43:43.368
No.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.471
- Are you all right?
- I'm grand.

43:50.270 --> 43:51.501
Do you wanna hang?

43:53.364 --> 43:54.572
Hang?

43:58.579 --> 44:00.830
Sophie and I used to come here all the time.

44:14.362 --> 44:16.577
This is where we first kissed.

44:17.386 --> 44:19.541
- No way.
- Yeah, right here.

44:19.542 --> 44:22.618
- You still remember that?
- Of course I remember it, you cheeky sod.

44:23.783 --> 44:27.871
A really... really profound moment for me.

44:31.014 --> 44:34.236
It's really hard to describe. It's like...

44:36.055 --> 44:37.499
it's like, it's like all your...

44:38.280 --> 44:42.175
you know, you're in this incredible
heightened moment and all your...

44:42.382 --> 44:47.726
your senses are working overtime
and your heart is thumping like crazy and, uh...

44:48.605 --> 44:50.014
the excitement of it.

44:50.864 --> 44:53.007
I'm breaking it though, I mean...

44:53.888 --> 44:58.391
I... I've never... been
out with a girl before.

45:00.181 --> 45:03.378
- What are you supposed to do?
- Well, you can do anything.

45:03.379 --> 45:06.507
That's the point, that's why
it's so exciting. You just gotta...

45:06.508 --> 45:09.730
close your eyes and
give yourself in to it.

45:18.988 --> 45:21.025
What's her name?

45:21.074 --> 45:23.325
- Shelly.
- Uh-huh.

45:25.246 --> 45:27.389
Well, go on then, what's she like?

45:30.126 --> 45:31.268
She's cool.

45:31.469 --> 45:33.814
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she's good. She's...

45:34.562 --> 45:36.813
she's different,
you know?

45:43.949 --> 45:46.138
Hey, you know the other day
you were talking about...

45:46.139 --> 45:49.456
standing on the railway tracks
and the train was coming towards you?

45:50.137 --> 45:51.475
What were you feeling?

45:52.327 --> 45:55.316
All right, no Adrian, I'm just
doin' mental, that's all.

45:55.317 --> 45:57.567
No, no you're not.

46:03.590 --> 46:06.884
Like, uh... like I had...

46:07.902 --> 46:10.247
control over somethin'.

46:12.073 --> 46:13.304
For once.

46:14.193 --> 46:15.424
Yeah.

46:17.322 --> 46:19.303
Maybe death does win.

46:19.304 --> 46:21.483
But at least I can decide when.

46:38.181 --> 46:40.360
What are you gonna do
with your boat, Adrian?

46:41.205 --> 46:42.578
It's just lyin' there.

46:43.257 --> 46:44.559

Is it O'Riley or Fitzgerald?

49:53.538 --> 49:54.884
O'Riley.

49:55.085 --> 49:57.915
So, where's the Fitzgerald come from?

49:58.248 --> 50:01.910
That's the name of the bastard
who used to be my father.

50:02.351 --> 50:06.616
My pathetic mother insists on us keepin'
it on even though he dumped us.

50:07.634 --> 50:09.600
That sucks.

50:10.486 --> 50:12.973
Yeah, at least it was quiet in the house.

50:14.657 --> 50:17.003
The fighting was getting out of hand.

50:17.855 --> 50:19.228
Do you see him much?

50:19.941 --> 50:21.087
No.

50:21.088 --> 50:23.850
I don't really get on with his girlfriend.

50:24.321 --> 50:27.330
Besides, their havin' a baby soon, so...

50:30.405 --> 50:35.723
I swear the day I turn eighteen I'm out of here.
You won't see me for dust.

50:35.724 --> 50:39.687
- Where'll you go?
- Oh, New York... Paris...

50:39.688 --> 50:41.167
- What will you do?
- I don't know.

50:41.773 --> 50:43.217
I haven't figured that out yet.

50:43.659 --> 50:45.103
I haven't found anything I'm good at.

50:45.745 --> 50:47.267
You're like the smartest
girl in the whole class.

50:47.291 --> 50:49.541
Yeah, who gives a shit about school?

50:50.081 --> 50:52.391
I'm talking about
having a real talent.

50:53.210 --> 50:54.619
Much like what you have, Donald.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.580
Your drawings are brilliant.

50:59.537 --> 51:01.883
I give anything to have a talent like that.

51:02.875 --> 51:05.018
I'd love to be good at something.

51:07.846 --> 51:09.184
You're amazing.

51:11.218 --> 51:12.425
For what?

51:13.200 --> 51:14.467
Everything.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.550
Like...

51:18.518 --> 51:21.129
you've just got your own take on things.

51:21.404 --> 51:22.707
Not a talent.

51:23.699 --> 51:25.644
But, like in English,

51:25.645 --> 51:29.677
right, where you just made up that Hamlet essay,
on the spot?

51:29.678 --> 51:32.910
- That was just drivel.
- It wasn't drivel! It wasn't.

51:32.911 --> 51:35.066
It was brilliant, it was genius.

51:35.067 --> 51:37.210
Like, nobody else couldv'e pulled that off.

51:38.056 --> 51:40.472
Seriously, I think you could be
a writer or something.

52:47.028 --> 52:48.974
Get us a drink.

52:48.975 --> 52:50.348
Okay, hold on one sec.

52:56.809 --> 52:59.320
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

53:00.482 --> 53:01.893
We're gonna just keep asking,
have you done it?

53:01.918 --> 53:02.824
What are you talkin' about?

53:02.837 --> 53:05.797
- Fucking shit!
- I'd say she's ready for a ballin'.

53:05.798 --> 53:08.929
You had a lap-dancer of your own and
you never told any of us about it.

53:08.930 --> 53:11.059
- What?
- Lads, I've got the clip!

53:11.148 --> 53:11.953
He has the clip.

53:11.954 --> 53:15.307
- I've got the clip.
- Come on, come on.

53:18.107 --> 53:20.593
Wait, lads, that's, that's pounce!
Wait, look, look, look!

53:21.363 --> 53:24.208
- Whoa! Go on!
- That is quality!

53:27.798 --> 53:31.129
- Tits! Unbelievable!
- Yeah, tits! Look at the tits, man!

53:33.820 --> 53:35.963
- Does she do that for you?
- Only in private, wanker.

53:37.053 --> 53:41.140
I knew she was mental.
I knew she was mental!

53:43.947 --> 53:47.328
Fair play, Clarkey, your girlfriend is nuts. She's dirty.

53:47.414 --> 53:49.923
Well, she's not my girlfriend,
I barely even know her.

54:03.238 --> 54:06.999
- Oh, well done, lads. It doesn't get old.
- Let's order in.

54:10.184 --> 54:11.364
Shelly, whoa. Wait a sec.

54:11.365 --> 54:12.596
Hold on.

54:13.586 --> 54:14.758
It's fine.

54:15.329 --> 54:17.874
- No, don't go! I just want to talk to you, that's all.
- Why?

54:18.157 --> 54:19.504
You're not my boyfriend.

54:30.208 --> 54:32.025
Shit.

54:56.107 --> 54:58.452
I fuckin' blew it. I blew it!

54:59.563 --> 55:00.883
- Do you want to come inside?
- No!

55:01.461 --> 55:03.641
I wanna come inside a woman twat.

55:07.509 --> 55:09.853
It was my one chance at love,

55:09.878 --> 55:12.919
my one chance at any kind of
relationship, and I have just...

55:19.051 --> 55:20.353
Tell me what happened.

55:21.103 --> 55:22.145
Why?

55:22.146 --> 55:25.342
So you can sit there and analyze me
and tell me what I really mean?

55:25.343 --> 55:27.394
No, I'm done talking,
I'm done with the...

55:27.395 --> 55:31.369
with the whole stupid therapy thing.
Okay? I'm just done with it. I'm finished.

55:33.686 --> 55:35.807
Did she say something to upset you?

55:35.808 --> 55:38.959
They're all filthy sluts anyway.

55:44.012 --> 55:46.236
No, no, can you
just leave me alone?

55:46.237 --> 55:50.538
Okay, you don't have to pretend
to be my friend anymore. Okay?

55:52.355 --> 55:55.542
I'm not pretending, I am your friend.

55:57.605 --> 55:58.907
Shall I call your parents?

55:59.725 --> 56:01.905
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

56:03.758 --> 56:05.061
Why are you saying that?

56:11.093 --> 56:13.545
Just leave me alone! Okay?
Just fuck off!

57:11.583 --> 57:13.667
You know, it's rude to stare.

57:13.668 --> 57:15.776
What age are you?

57:15.858 --> 57:18.848
- Same as you.
- I'm six.

57:18.849 --> 57:20.151
I'm 30-12.

57:20.442 --> 57:21.692
No you're not.

57:22.046 --> 57:23.992
What's your name?

57:23.993 --> 57:25.209
Maya, what's yours?

57:25.210 --> 57:26.441
I'm Maya, too.

57:26.752 --> 57:29.062
- Same here.
- You're a man.

57:29.416 --> 57:31.524
Yeah, my real name is Billy.

57:32.925 --> 57:35.192
And what are you gonna
be when you grow up?

57:35.392 --> 57:37.202
- A dancer.
- Wow.

57:37.456 --> 57:39.193
I'm going to be a prince.

57:39.337 --> 57:40.645
What's your real name?

57:40.819 --> 57:43.768
- I'm going to be a super hero.
- No you're not.

58:01.539 --> 58:03.728
Well, hello there.

58:03.729 --> 58:06.003
Long time no see.

58:06.719 --> 58:10.036
You didn't think we were done, did you?

58:12.907 --> 58:15.252
I'm tired of waiting.

58:16.209 --> 58:20.510
So young but so ripe.

58:27.682 --> 58:29.991
Help me!

58:30.567 --> 58:31.643
Donald.

58:31.644 --> 58:33.894
Help me!

58:35.381 --> 58:36.563
It's okay, son.

58:36.964 --> 58:39.380
- It's just a nightmare.
- He was cuttin' me open!

58:39.987 --> 58:41.325
- Shhh.
- He cut me!

58:42.143 --> 58:44.488
- It's just a panic attack.
- He cut me open.

58:45.272 --> 58:48.435
It's dad! It's dad, it's dad, it's dad, it's okay.

58:48.436 --> 58:51.668
- It's okay, it's okay son.
- No!

58:51.669 --> 58:53.919
- It's okay.
- Make it better, daddy.

58:57.891 --> 58:59.003
Where's your grass?

58:59.004 --> 59:01.054
- What?
- Your grass, where is it?

59:01.055 --> 59:02.322
I don't smoke grass.

59:10.476 --> 59:12.513
Are you any better?

59:16.629 --> 59:17.931
Much better, thanks.

59:18.507 --> 59:19.723
Yeah?

59:19.724 --> 59:21.867
Hey, give us another go.

59:31.090 --> 59:33.400
How cool is this, huh?

59:35.871 --> 59:37.687
You know I'm only letting you do this

59:37.822 --> 59:40.167
because it alleviates anxiety?

59:42.171 --> 59:43.509
Absolutely.

59:45.797 --> 59:47.276
So if your mother asks,

59:47.443 --> 59:49.101
- Mmm?
- you know what to say?

59:49.259 --> 59:50.545
- Yeah.
- Okay.

59:51.046 --> 59:53.082
You'll back me up?

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:03.585
Thank you for being
here with me, guys. It's...

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:05.667
it's great.

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:11.026
Yes.

01:00:12.117 --> 01:00:15.434
Yes, yes, yes, we have lift-off.

01:00:16.979 --> 01:00:18.281
Ooh!

01:00:20.178 --> 01:00:21.480
Yeah.

01:00:22.194 --> 01:00:23.496
Ah.

01:00:25.392 --> 01:00:27.464
Very nice!

01:00:28.451 --> 01:00:29.753
Very nice.

01:00:32.484 --> 01:00:34.900
Everything's gone just a little bit to the left.

01:00:53.551 --> 01:00:56.738
You know, you've been the
most incredible son to me.

01:00:58.592 --> 01:01:00.036
You've given me so much.

01:01:01.386 --> 01:01:02.617
So much,

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:06.018
that you will never know.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.427
You're an amazing man.

01:01:11.142 --> 01:01:12.409
Amazing.

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.512
And I love you.

01:01:17.504 --> 01:01:19.684
I love you so much, son.

01:01:28.906 --> 01:01:30.209
Thanks, Dad.

01:01:33.112 --> 01:01:35.327
- Jeff.
- Yeah?

01:01:35.837 --> 01:01:37.621
I think he was talkin' to me.

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.968
He is dying! Donald is dying!
Get that into your head!

01:02:23.501 --> 01:02:26.591
- Well, he's alive now, isn't he?
- Yeah.

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:31.151
We had one joint.

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.962
- We talked. We had fun.
- I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not doin' it no more.

01:02:34.506 --> 01:02:36.079
- I'm finished.
- He talked to me!

01:02:38.748 --> 01:02:40.927

His treatment wasn't very intensive today.

01:04:25.691 --> 01:04:27.400
Can I ask you not to stay too long?

01:04:39.623 --> 01:04:41.695
Hi, Don.

01:04:45.845 --> 01:04:48.357
I, uh, found this picture.

01:04:50.589 --> 01:04:55.021
I know you didn't give it to me...
officially or anything, but, um

01:04:57.317 --> 01:04:59.460
I really like it.

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:05.816
So, you could sign it for me, or somethin'.

01:05:10.566 --> 01:05:12.369
I'll come back another time.

01:05:18.141 --> 01:05:22.442
You know, all that stuff at
the party was... bollocks.

01:05:24.363 --> 01:05:25.801
It was ages ago.

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:31.757
I was just on a mad one, you know?

01:05:40.146 --> 01:05:42.555
Look, if you... if you wanna hang out,

01:05:44.179 --> 01:05:46.523
when you're back on your feet, like.

01:05:49.118 --> 01:05:51.508
That'd be cool.

01:06:01.944 --> 01:06:04.087
Have either of you guys seen Shelly?

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:10.217
I don't know about Shelly, man, maybe
you should just forget about her.

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:15.488
Did you tell him about Sharon?

01:06:16.614 --> 01:06:19.937
Oh yeah, we broke up.

01:06:21.802 --> 01:06:23.291
Bummer.

01:06:23.316 --> 01:06:24.817
It's no big deal,

01:06:24.818 --> 01:06:27.033
I've moved on.

01:06:27.981 --> 01:06:30.554
There's actually a party on tonight,
if you wanted to, I mean...

01:06:30.579 --> 01:06:32.123
Yeah, but we're not invited.

01:06:32.223 --> 01:06:33.822
It doesn't matter, we're crashing.

01:06:34.204 --> 01:06:35.616
Always need guys.

01:06:52.943 --> 01:06:56.633
What if, um... we asked around at school?

01:06:56.810 --> 01:07:00.107
- Asked what?
- Donald's not gonna die a virgin, agreed?

01:07:01.959 --> 01:07:05.347
- What, like a sympathy shag?
- A shag is a shag, Michael.

01:07:07.404 --> 01:07:09.714
Well, fast, fast, fast.

01:07:10.741 --> 01:07:12.992
Morna.

01:07:13.731 --> 01:07:15.982
- Morna.
- What?

01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:20.022
- Do you know, eh, Don?
- Who?

01:07:20.023 --> 01:07:23.317
- Donald Clarke, from your year.
- Yeah.

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:25.745
Do you like him?

01:07:26.991 --> 01:07:28.326
- What?
- Morna.

01:07:28.402 --> 01:07:30.510
Give me a second.

01:07:30.522 --> 01:07:31.771
Why?

01:07:33.328 --> 01:07:34.963
Would you be willin'
to have sex with him?

01:07:36.503 --> 01:07:37.756
What?

01:07:37.857 --> 01:07:41.634
- Would you be willin' to have sex with him?
- Are you serious?

01:07:42.899 --> 01:07:45.354
- Yeah.
- No.

01:07:45.886 --> 01:07:48.614
- Hugo, that's gross!
- That's fair enough.

01:07:48.739 --> 01:07:50.444
Fair enough.

01:07:51.103 --> 01:07:52.582
I told you.

01:07:56.630 --> 01:08:00.789
- Are you havin' a piss?
- No, it's a real situation.

01:08:02.175 --> 01:08:03.916
You guys are weirdos.

01:08:03.961 --> 01:08:06.484
Okay, it's... that's fine.
We understand handily.

01:08:06.955 --> 01:08:09.040
- Weirdos!
- Okay.

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:13.436
- It's like nearly sick.
- Okay, okay, fair enough.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.929
If we were to... give you some money,

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.871
would that change your mind?

01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:22.443
No!

01:08:23.676 --> 01:08:24.848
I don't know about this, guys.

01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:27.308
Look, we're here now, Jeff, you're not chickening out.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.697
Okay, look at her. Over there on the
left, white wooly top with the tits.

01:08:32.639 --> 01:08:34.551
- Look at her.
- Stop pointing, will you?

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:35.947
- I think she's all right.
- Okay.

01:08:35.948 --> 01:08:38.207
- All right, Jeff, ask her.
- Wait, why me?

01:08:38.207 --> 01:08:41.533
- 'Cause you're the oldest.
- What do you mean "the oldest?" This was your idea.

01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:43.386
Okay. Excuse me.

01:08:43.388 --> 01:08:46.446
- Excuse me, yes.
- Wait just one sec, Hugo. Hugo, stop!

01:08:46.447 --> 01:08:47.627
- Hi.
- You all right, lads?

01:08:47.629 --> 01:08:49.749
- Yeah, yeah, we're fine thank you.
- Um, no, we're not.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:52.760
- Just ask her!
- He, um... he, he wants... he's...

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.029
he's lookin' for some...
- What do you mean, me? I don't want anything.

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.944
- Shh, just ask her.
- Umm... how much?

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.166
- For the three of you's?
- It's gonna cost you, love.

01:09:03.167 --> 01:09:07.599
- Just think of them as ladies... for hire.
- Don't worry about mom and dad.

01:09:09.122 --> 01:09:10.352
Just take your pick.

01:09:15.787 --> 01:09:19.278
- I'm not sure about this, guys.
- We've tried everything else.

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:21.828
No one in school would agree to do it.

01:09:24.062 --> 01:09:25.365
Would agree to do what?

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:31.258
Did you two go around asking girls
if they'd have sex with me?

01:09:31.259 --> 01:09:33.533
- No!
- Yes.

01:09:34.282 --> 01:09:36.437
- Did you?
- Keep it down, lads, please.

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:37.667
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

01:09:38.662 --> 01:09:40.883
- Did you?
- No.

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:49.586
- Well, hello, handsome!
- Superhero, my ass!

01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:51.611
- Oh, pick me, pick me!
- Oh, you handsome boy!

01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:56.392
You can have this, honey-bunny.
Choose.

01:09:56.393 --> 01:10:00.480
Still thinking about that schoolgirl?

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.818
Billy died.

01:15:17.195 --> 01:15:18.533
His parents are on the way in.

01:15:19.058 --> 01:15:20.861
Okay.

01:15:28.667 --> 01:15:30.035
What a night.

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:33.174
Was he in a panic?

01:15:34.856 --> 01:15:37.108
No, no.

01:15:40.279 --> 01:15:42.329
Excuse me.

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.437
Donald asked me to give you this.

01:15:47.371 --> 01:15:48.638
Thank you.

01:16:14.046 --> 01:16:16.270
So, Jeff was telling us all
about the New York Knicks.

01:16:16.642 --> 01:16:21.002
- The stadiums, the girls.
- Yeah, I know. He never shuts up about America.

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:25.653
Come on now, it's a fascinating place.

01:16:27.718 --> 01:16:29.036
Yeah.

01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:35.187
So I was thinking maybe we
could go over, you know?

01:16:36.353 --> 01:16:38.627
When you're feeling up to it, catch a game?

01:16:41.732 --> 01:16:43.541
Yeah.

01:16:55.196 --> 01:16:58.418
- I'll just get some coffees.
- Yeah.

01:17:04.594 --> 01:17:06.286
Is he all right?

01:17:07.306 --> 01:17:10.695
- Don't worry about us.
- I'm not worried about you.

01:17:12.033 --> 01:17:14.242
You may be a mental control-freak, but...

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:17.965
you're strong.

01:17:19.148 --> 01:17:21.291
I don't think he is, though.

01:17:23.285 --> 01:17:27.515
He might need a bit of lookin' after.

01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:39.802
So listen, I'm gonna go and do a shop in a bit.

01:17:41.050 --> 01:17:43.157
Any special requests?

01:18:16.509 --> 01:18:18.783
And this mysterious friend of yours,

01:18:19.602 --> 01:18:21.817
what's his name?

01:18:22.801 --> 01:18:27.476
His, his name is... Donald,

01:18:28.376 --> 01:18:32.735
and he is...

01:18:34.273 --> 01:18:38.360
he's a... a... he's a young man...

01:18:40.322 --> 01:18:42.668
- Is he eighteen?
- Yes.

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:45.389
And you're sounding me out?

01:18:46.144 --> 01:18:48.390
No! No, no.

01:18:52.776 --> 01:18:56.263
Well, actually yes, I suppose
I am, really. I am, I am.

01:18:56.517 --> 01:18:59.991
'Cause I just... I just need to know...

01:19:00.007 --> 01:19:02.807
Adrian, rest assured.

01:19:02.869 --> 01:19:05.347
I'll treat Donald with absolute sensitivity.

01:19:11.244 --> 01:19:13.108
Thank you.

01:19:22.767 --> 01:19:24.923
He's not eighteen.

01:19:30.487 --> 01:19:34.646
He's never going to be eighteen.

01:19:59.584 --> 01:20:06.734
Tonya, this is going to be his first,
and his last, experience.

01:20:09.841 --> 01:20:11.017
Keep an eye on.

01:20:18.322 --> 01:20:21.233
- I've got no clothes to put on.
- Just get into the bed!

01:20:23.306 --> 01:20:26.260
- This is stupid. I look ridiculous.
- Not at all. - You look great.

01:20:26.285 --> 01:20:28.285
Don't worry about it.

01:20:32.923 --> 01:20:34.189
Oh, my hair?

01:20:35.008 --> 01:20:38.576
Oh, my hat, it
might be in there.

01:20:41.162 --> 01:20:43.436
What if a nurse comes in?

01:20:43.921 --> 01:20:45.808
Just snore really loud.

01:21:03.029 --> 01:21:05.244
- Your limo, sir.
- Thank you.

01:21:37.549 --> 01:21:41.345
Right. Well, off you go.

01:21:43.667 --> 01:21:45.076
It's, uh, second floor, number 21.

01:21:57.130 --> 01:21:58.207
Hi.

01:21:58.408 --> 01:22:00.423
You must be Donald,

01:22:00.424 --> 01:22:02.567
come on in.

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:16.887
I'm just making myself a gin and tonic,
what would you like?

01:22:18.015 --> 01:22:20.230
Um, I'll just have the same.

01:22:25.857 --> 01:22:27.488
Ice?

01:22:28.583 --> 01:22:30.690
Yeah.

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:39.171
Actually no, can I...
can I just have a Coke?

01:22:39.551 --> 01:22:41.670
Sure.

01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:44.929
Why don't you get comfortable?
Sit down, Donald.

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.427
Can I ask you something?

01:23:27.491 --> 01:23:29.088
Of course.

01:23:34.152 --> 01:23:35.746
What's sex like?

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.195
Really like.

01:23:38.997 --> 01:23:41.765
And there's just a few things that I'd
quite like to clear up before you...

01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:43.790
Well...

01:23:44.142 --> 01:23:46.357
when you're with the right person,

01:23:47.271 --> 01:23:52.639
you could say it's like...
it's like a competition,

01:23:53.633 --> 01:23:56.242
where you're both trying
to let the other side win.

01:24:01.942 --> 01:24:06.053
- Have you ever been in love?
- Sadly, no.

01:24:08.139 --> 01:24:11.758
But why not? I mean, you're so beautiful.

01:24:11.932 --> 01:24:14.354
A lot of men find me attractive,

01:24:14.691 --> 01:24:17.170
but that's just a physical thing.

01:24:18.459 --> 01:24:21.080
Being in love is so much more.

01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:24.597
I hope to experience
that one day.

01:24:31.039 --> 01:24:34.297
Adrian tells me that you're
a brilliant artist.

01:24:41.538 --> 01:24:44.552
Would you like to see my drawings?

01:24:46.436 --> 01:24:47.973
I would love to.

01:24:59.268 --> 01:25:01.578
They are great.

01:25:03.508 --> 01:25:06.517
Wow.

01:25:07.876 --> 01:25:10.558
I'd give anything to
have a talent like that.

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.134
Wait, what did you just say?

01:25:16.789 --> 01:25:19.134
I'd give anything to
have a talent like that.

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:28.196
I'm gonna miss you.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:35.793
You're so weak.
Even a kiss could kill you.

01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:48.230
