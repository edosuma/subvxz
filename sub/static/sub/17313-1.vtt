- How's she doing?
- Fine, but we have two more in labor.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.044
You sure can forget about
watching that eclipse.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.468
We'd better get on in.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.137
Mrs. Brody, I thought I told you
to wait till next week.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.013
Tell it to the baby.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.983
- How's Mrs. Seton?
- A few minutes.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.194
First time I've ever had
the ladies gang up on me.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.905
I've waited some time.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.867
- Shallow breaths now.
- Push!

02:46.249 --> 02:48.615
It's a boy, Mrs. Taylor.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.915
Oh, he's beautiful.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.003
Open, Mrs. Brody.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.123
Bear down!

02:56.259 --> 02:58.090
Push.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.340
It's a girl, Mrs. Brody.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.180
It doesn't even have a name yet!

03:06.895 --> 03:09.307
It's a boy, Mrs. Seton.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.797
Do you want to play ambulance?

03:37.926 --> 03:39.587
What's that?

03:40.679 --> 03:42.260
Well

03:43.390 --> 03:45.631
this is the ambulance,

03:45.767 --> 03:48.759
and when you want it to stop,
you say, "red light".

04:02.826 --> 04:04.532
Red light!

04:05.203 --> 04:08.445
I don't remember an ambulance
stopping for a red light.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.987
- What if somebody sees us out here?
- Nobody will see us here.

04:44.326 --> 04:48.035
Well, they might,
cos we're right out here in the open.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.581
If you're that worried
about somebody seeing us...

04:52.709 --> 04:54.574

08:00.605 --> 08:03.597

through the door like a normal person?

You're lucky mom and dad aren't home.

Does anybody know why it's important
to cooperate with the police?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.901
Curtis?

08:59.247 --> 09:02.990
The job of the police is to protect people
and help them if they're in trouble.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.041
You're late, Joyce.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.919

Does anybody know
what the word "murder" means?

09:29.903 --> 09:30.903
Debbie?

09:32.447 --> 09:35.280
It's when someone kills someone,

09:36.284 --> 09:38.946
No, honey, not like on TV.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.365

09:44.167 --> 09:46.704
What does he think we are,
a bunch of babies?

09:46.836 --> 09:52.297
Has anyone lost or found
a skipping rope with a handle like this?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.219
I'm sure some of you have heard

10:02.352 --> 10:06.220
that Annie Smith and Duke Benson
have been murdered.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.522
Were any of you
in the cemetery last night?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.566
If you remember seeing anything unusual,

10:17.367 --> 10:21.201
you can tell miss Davis
or come and tell me.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.531
That bell does not mean
that you are dismissed.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.956
It is only a signal
for me to dismiss you.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.834
Thank you, sheriff Brody.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.923
Thank you, miss Davis.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.337
- Bye, dad.
- Bye, honey.

10:41.975 --> 10:47.060
When you are all sitting quiet
and straight at your desks, I will let go.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.973
You're not sitting straight enough.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.568
Alright.

11:03.705 --> 11:08.790
Now, I don't want to see any of you running
out of here like a bunch of hooligans.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.254
Dis-missed!

11:28.980 --> 11:31.892
- Where were you last night?
- Feeding the dog.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.109
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.774
- Are you sure?
- Yes, positive.

11:41.910 --> 11:45.027
If mom and dad call,
don't tell them about Duke and Annie.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.198
Why not?

11:46.331 --> 11:49.823
Because I don't want dad worrying.
It's bad for his heart.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.133
Miss Davis, can the class be excused
from homework next Monday?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.174
- No, dear.
- But it's our birthday.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.172
Everyone's gonna be at the party.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.805
Homework is more important than a party.

12:10.939 --> 12:15.182
And just because you all have the same
birthday doesn't mean that you're special.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.775

Yeah, but you think he's cute, though,
don't you?

16:24.942 --> 16:26.853

- To get some candles for the birthday cake,

and then Willard and I
are gonna go to the drive-in.

- Why?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.665
Don't ask why.

19:21.661 --> 19:27.327
Sheriff Brody was a dedicated,
honest, hardworking man.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.791
And now let me remind you
of the words of our lord Jesus.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.543
"Let not your heart be troubled,

19:33.673 --> 19:37.006
"for in my father's house
are many mansions.

19:37.134 --> 19:41.173
"I go now to prepare a place for you,
in the house of the lord.

19:41.305 --> 19:44.513
"Where I go, you cannot follow,

19:44.642 --> 19:48.760
"but ye that believeth in me
shall have eternal life"

19:49.647 --> 19:51.308
let us pray.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.978
Our father who art in heaven,

19:55.111 --> 19:56.567
hallowed be thy name,

19:57.780 --> 19:59.771
thy kingdom come,

19:59.907 --> 20:01.568
thy will be done,

20:01.701 --> 20:04.613
on earth as it is in heaven.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.485
Forgive us our trespasses,

20:06.622 --> 20:08.829
as those who trespass against us.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.823
And deliver us from evil,

20:10.960 --> 20:17.001
for thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, forever.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.748
Amen.

One, two, three,

20:24.557 --> 20:27.344
four, five, six...

20:29.103 --> 20:31.845
Come on.
I got a real good place to hide.

20:33.774 --> 20:37.062
Don't copy our hiding place,
or I'll shoot you.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.859
Uh, don't worry.
It's only a phony.

20:42.992 --> 20:46.075
- Come on, let's get in.
- No way, man, that's dangerous.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.945
Oh, I knew you were a chicken.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.946
We're not gonna shut both doors.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.079
Chicken, chicken!

20:58.215 --> 20:59.830
Chicken, chicken.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.676

21:31.290 --> 21:34.282
I'm not gonna play no more, Curtis.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.033
You let me out!

21:48.182 --> 21:51.015
Did you know the United States
has a horoscope, just like people?

21:53.229 --> 21:56.892
Every twenty years, there's a conjunction
of planets that's really bad,

21:57.024 --> 22:00.858
and every president that's been elected
during that conjunction has died in office.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.034
I would definitely include that
in your article.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.652
It's strange.

22:08.577 --> 22:13.071
It makes you wonder if our lives
are planned out even before we're born.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.163
That's an interesting idea.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.534
Um... what do you say, we'll get a coke
and talk about it some more?

22:19.964 --> 22:24.583
I'd really like to, but my little brother is
home alone and I have to check in on him.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.015
How did you do that?

22:34.144 --> 22:38.433
I reconnected these
and hooked this panel into the circuit.

22:38.566 --> 22:41.524
You little son of a gun.
Where did you learn to do that?

22:45.823 --> 22:47.529
Let me out!

22:50.327 --> 22:53.319

<i>- Oh, I'm getting along ok.</i>

23:53.682 --> 23:56.799
<i>- You got everything under control?</i>
- Sure.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.552
<i>Joyce,
can you put Timmy on the line?</i>

23:59.688 --> 24:02.475
Um, no, he's outside playing
right now.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.644
<i>Giving you any trouble?</i>

24:04.777 --> 24:07.018
No more than usual.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.942
Help! Please, somebody help!

24:11.533 --> 24:14.070
Anybody! Help! Please!

24:15.245 --> 24:17.657
Can somebody help me?

24:19.333 --> 24:21.915
<i>Dad and I are going to go
on a wilderness trail.</i>

24:22.044 --> 24:23.580
Do it, daddy, it'd be good for you.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.962
<i>Are you sure you can manage
by yourself for that long?</i>

24:27.091 --> 24:30.254
Just relax!
That's what you're on vacation for.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.952
Timmy!

25:44.209 --> 25:45.824
Timmy!

26:39.765 --> 26:41.630

26:41.767 --> 26:44.850
In the junkyard.
Curtis locked me in a refrigerator.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.805
Timmy, it's getting to the point
when you don't even know when you're lying.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.102
I'm not lying!

26:53.362 --> 26:54.943
How did you scratch your hand?

26:55.072 --> 26:57.154
I told you, I was in the refrigerator.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.398
Sure, just like when you were
feeding the dog.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.866
Come on, let's get it cleaned up
before it gets infected.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.664
What were you really doing
Sunday night?

27:11.713 --> 27:14.625
Alright, I was over at Debbie's house.

27:14.758 --> 27:18.046
- At night?
- Yeah, but she wasn't home.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.637
Then why'd you go over there?

27:23.433 --> 27:26.266
Timmy, I know you're lying,
so just tell me the truth.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.228
Ok.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.569
See, Debbie's got this little peephole
in her closet. Well...

27:37.698 --> 27:40.610
so she charges 25 cents
to watch Beverly...

27:42.744 --> 27:44.826
You know... Undress.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.073
You little peeping Tom!

27:50.210 --> 27:53.623
I didn't see anything, I promise.
Debbie wasn't even home.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.235
You won't tell mom and dad, will you?

27:56.258 --> 27:58.214
No, don't worry.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.591
I don't want you playing
with Curtis anymore.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.810
And I don't want you to go
into the junkyard, ok?

28:11.064 --> 28:13.350
- Ok.
- Promise?

28:14.818 --> 28:16.399
Yeah.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.522
Ok.

28:22.367 --> 28:26.701
"You're not quiet enough, children,
you're not quiet enough.

28:26.830 --> 28:30.118
"That bell does only signal me
to dismiss you.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.287
"It doesn't mean you're dismissed!"

28:33.420 --> 28:36.207
We'll sure make her quiet enough.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.390
Curtis, you should not
sneak up on people.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.013
I wasn't sneaking, miss Davis.

31:00.984 --> 31:04.317
If you bring that replica to school
one more time,

31:04.446 --> 31:07.404
I'm going to take it away from you,
and you're not going to get it back.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.649
Alright, miss Davis.
I'll put it away.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.447
Why don't you make yourself useful?

31:13.580 --> 31:16.617
Uh, get me some brushes.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.632
Uh!

32:04.339 --> 32:05.374
Hi, Timmy!

32:54.848 --> 32:56.463
Chicken, chicken, chicken pot!

33:00.312 --> 33:01.472
Chicken!

33:02.272 --> 33:05.355
Stop it, you two. Stop it!

33:05.484 --> 33:07.224
You leave him alone!

33:08.778 --> 33:10.985
Curtis, are you alright?

33:31.384 --> 33:34.171
Help me! Help me!

33:34.304 --> 33:37.046
Help me!

33:51.821 --> 33:53.812
You're sure you're ok?
Are you sure?

33:53.949 --> 33:57.282
- Yeah, I'll be ok.
- You... ok.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.617
- Thanks.
- Ok.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.047
Can't even keep a promise for one day.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.572
Hi, Timmy. What are you doing?

34:46.876 --> 34:48.741
- Nothing.
- Come on up here.

34:48.878 --> 34:51.915
No, I can't. I gotta get home.
My sister will kill me if I'm late.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.420
You won't be late.
It's only three o'clock.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.629
Ok.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.183
You still gonna have
your birthday party tomorrow?

35:05.312 --> 35:06.472
Yep.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.721
- Have you ever played doctor?
- No.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.939
Me neither, but I know
how to play ambulance.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.814
- What's that?
- A game.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.527
I'd rather play baseball.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.588
Phone's ringing.
Do you want me to climb down and get it?

35:43.683 --> 35:47.426
No, it's probably just my dumb sister.
She lives on the phone.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.182
Hey, whose book's that?

35:52.442 --> 35:53.727
Mine.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.602
- What's it about?
- It's a secret book.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.275
- Like a diary?
- Yeah.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.192
Well, goodbye.

36:04.329 --> 36:05.819
Bye.

36:24.391 --> 36:25.972
Timmy!

36:32.732 --> 36:34.063
Timmy!

36:38.405 --> 36:39.941
Timmy!

39:14.394 --> 39:15.804
What's going on here?

39:15.937 --> 39:19.475
Somebody tried to run me down
in that car.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.144
Ok, let's... let's go down
and take a look.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.286
There's nobody in here now.

39:43.423 --> 39:46.711
There was someone in there,
and he's got a blanket over his head.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.424
A blanket? A blanket?

39:48.553 --> 39:51.260
- Yeah, he was trying to kill me.
<i>- Duncan!</i>

39:51.389 --> 39:53.050
Wait, wait.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.673
<i>Duncan</i>

39:58.146 --> 40:00.603
<i>- Goddammit, Duncan, where are you?</i>
- I'm here. Over.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.350
<i>Ok. We've a call from Deirdre Wilson,
across from the graveyard.</i>

40:04.485 --> 40:07.397
<i>- Thinks she saw a psycho lurking.</i>
- I got it, Dave.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.940
<i>A call from cookie Lamar.</i>

40:09.073 --> 40:11.610
<i>A psycho was watching her,
whilst she was taking a shower.</i>

40:11.743 --> 40:13.779
<i>A call from Brett.
We have a suspect.</i>

40:13.912 --> 40:15.948
<i>A call from your wife.
We have a suspect.</i>

40:16.080 --> 40:19.072
<i>A call from the mayor.
We have a [expletive deleted] suspect.</i>

40:45.318 --> 40:47.650
<i>Meadowvale Police believe
that the tragic death today</i>

40:47.779 --> 40:50.111
<i>of Meadowvale Elementary School teacher
miss Violet Davis</i>

40:50.239 --> 40:52.275
<i>may be linked
to the bizarre graveyard killings</i>

40:52.408 --> 40:54.740
<i>of two local teenagers
earlier this week.</i>

40:54.869 --> 40:57.906
<i>- Police are working on the theory that...</i>
- Listen, Timmy,

40:58.039 --> 41:01.531
from now on I'm gonna
take you to and from school,

41:01.668 --> 41:04.705
and I don't want you going anywhere
by yourself.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.784
Timmy, in the house!

41:41.916 --> 41:43.952
I told you to get in here
ten minutes ago.

41:55.805 --> 41:59.889
"Deceptiveness and deviousness
are totally foreign to your nature.

42:00.018 --> 42:04.057
"You indulge in rash behavior,
and you worry a lot."

42:04.188 --> 42:05.803
Now, who does that sound like?

42:05.940 --> 42:07.601
- Dad?
- Right.

42:09.485 --> 42:13.069
"You're extremely concerned
about your attractiveness,

42:13.197 --> 42:16.360
"totally confident,
and enormously seductive."

42:17.410 --> 42:20.493
- You, right?
- Wrong.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.612
- Beverly!
- Yeah!

42:25.251 --> 42:28.209
You know, it's surprising
how much you can miss someone

42:28.337 --> 42:30.578
when all they ever did was bitch at you,
you know?

42:30.715 --> 42:32.922
Stop you from doing things.

42:33.051 --> 42:36.714
Jesus, it's hard to believe.
A tough guy like your father.

42:36.846 --> 42:39.462
Killed via skateboard.

42:39.599 --> 42:41.260
Yeah.

42:41.392 --> 42:44.759
Little angel face was really careless.

42:55.073 --> 42:56.654
Here?

42:57.408 --> 43:00.275
- What if your mom comes home?
- I don't care.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.618
I just want to forget.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.063
This is Debbie's chart.

43:40.159 --> 43:42.445
It's really weird.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.742
Because there was an eclipse
the day she was born,

43:46.874 --> 43:49.786
both the sun and the moon
were blocking Saturn,

43:49.919 --> 43:53.207
so there should be something missing
from her personality.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.839
- Why?
- Because Saturn controls your emotions

43:56.968 --> 43:58.924
and the way that you treat people.

46:08.808 --> 46:10.764
I think somebody's out there.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.009
Nobody's out there. It's ok.

46:14.855 --> 46:17.847
- Go look. Ok?
- Alright.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.158
It's ok.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.657
What was that?
There is somebody out there!

47:21.464 --> 47:24.376
No! No!

48:06.884 --> 48:08.749
I can't believe you read this stuff.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.877
Well, it's all true.

48:29.949 --> 48:31.564
Hey, Beverly...

48:33.411 --> 48:35.367
Beverly!

48:35.496 --> 48:36.986
Um...

48:37.665 --> 48:40.465
Do you know your little sister Debbie
has been charging the little boys

48:40.584 --> 48:42.120
25 cents to watch you undress?

48:43.587 --> 48:44.622
What?

48:50.428 --> 48:52.510
A peephole.

48:54.682 --> 48:57.890
Oh, no! I don't believe it!

49:09.530 --> 49:11.862
Joyce knows,
and she's not going to keep quiet.

49:11.991 --> 49:14.573
- So what?
- They might believe her.

49:14.702 --> 49:16.613
Not if they think she's crazy.

49:17.288 --> 49:20.030
- What are you gonna do?
- You'll see.

49:23.127 --> 49:25.368
- Got it?
- Yeah.

49:30.759 --> 49:32.966
Here you go.

49:43.230 --> 49:44.436
Curtis.

49:45.399 --> 49:46.605
Steven.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.191
Debbie?

49:55.618 --> 49:57.233
Now make a wish.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.707
Three really special children,
aren't they, Madge?

50:13.636 --> 50:16.423
I would just like to say to you all

50:16.555 --> 50:19.672
how much I appreciate

50:19.808 --> 50:23.471
you coming here today
to wish the children a happy birthday.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.933
Uh...

50:29.318 --> 50:31.730
There is...

50:31.862 --> 50:36.697
One person who is not here today.

50:39.620 --> 50:43.579
He would very much like
to have been here today

50:43.707 --> 50:45.743
with us all.
- It's ok, Madge, it's ok.

50:50.339 --> 50:52.876
Come on, everybody,
let's have some cake, ok?

51:11.193 --> 51:13.855
It sure is wonderful to see everybody
enjoying themselves,

51:13.988 --> 51:15.649
in spite of what's been going on.

51:15.781 --> 51:19.069
It is a relief to get out. You know,
I've been afraid to leave the house lately.

51:19.201 --> 51:21.362
Are you any closer
to catching this maniac?

51:21.495 --> 51:26.159
Well, we've got a few clues, but we ain't
been able to focus on nothing specific.

51:27.167 --> 51:29.078
I'm scared to go out at night.

51:58.824 --> 52:02.783
Do you want to get another cake?
These guys are eating like pigs.

52:52.461 --> 52:53.496
Curtis!

52:54.797 --> 52:56.003
You're making a mess.

53:27.121 --> 53:29.863
I'm gonna need another cake.
Will you get me one?

53:41.260 --> 53:43.717
What's the matter with you?
Look at that cake.

53:47.766 --> 53:50.007
What have you got behind your back?

53:59.945 --> 54:02.027
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

54:09.288 --> 54:11.324
Oh, no!

54:11.457 --> 54:15.041
Don't eat that cake. Curtis poisoned
the icing, don't eat that cake!

54:15.169 --> 54:18.457
Don't eat the cake!
Curtis poisoned the... don't eat it!

54:18.589 --> 54:20.875
Curtis poisoned the icing.
Don't eat the cake!

54:26.472 --> 54:29.839
- Curtis, he poisoned the...
- I wasn't doing nothing.

54:30.517 --> 54:34.305
The poison was just sitting on the counter.
I was putting it away.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.894
You were not, you little liar!

54:36.023 --> 54:38.765
Watch what you're saying.
He never told a lie in his life.

54:38.901 --> 54:42.064
Hold on, Joyce.
Exactly what did you see?

54:43.947 --> 54:46.563
I went into the kitchen,
and he was putting icing on the cake.

54:47.534 --> 54:50.992
And he had a decorator in one hand
and a bottle of poison in the other hand.

54:51.121 --> 54:53.328
You're crazy.
Let me have some of that icing.

54:53.874 --> 54:57.412
- What are you doing?
- Eating the frosting. The icing!

55:18.732 --> 55:21.519
You tricked me, didn't you?
Didn't you?

55:21.652 --> 55:24.109
I eave him alone.

55:24.238 --> 55:29.232
You made me think that you put poison
in that icing on purpose, didn't you?

55:29.368 --> 55:31.905
And you locked Timmy in the refrigerator
on purpose, didn't you?

55:32.037 --> 55:33.618
Leave him alone!
Come, get out of here.

55:33.747 --> 55:36.739
She's been upset
ever since she found miss Davis.

55:44.758 --> 55:48.421
Curtis doesn't even seem to know
the things he's doing are wrong.

55:49.555 --> 55:52.763
- It's like he has no feelings.
- That's Curtis for sure.

55:53.475 --> 55:55.557
Maybe that's what's missing.

55:57.229 --> 55:59.265
His conscience.

56:02.192 --> 56:04.148
You stay here.

57:22.064 --> 57:23.725
Did you open up the door?

57:24.399 --> 57:25.399
What?

57:26.026 --> 57:28.358
Did you open up the patio door?

57:28.820 --> 57:29.855
No.

57:32.491 --> 57:34.903
Hey.

57:37.079 --> 57:39.365
- Paul!
- Hey.

57:44.127 --> 57:45.913
What are you doing here?

57:46.046 --> 57:48.628
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

57:48.757 --> 57:52.875
- Aren't you glad to see me?
- Yeah, I'm really glad to see you.

57:54.930 --> 57:57.137
Hey. Hey, what about your finals?

57:58.016 --> 58:01.258
I decided to take off.
I missed you.

58:01.395 --> 58:03.556
I missed you, too.

58:15.659 --> 58:17.775
Timmy.

58:18.495 --> 58:20.702
Well, dad told you
to watch out for me, right?

58:22.082 --> 58:25.040
- Right.
- He told me to watch out for you, too.

58:27.337 --> 58:28.873
Well, why don't you watch out for me

58:29.006 --> 58:31.668
from inside your room
with the door shut, ok?

58:39.850 --> 58:41.260
Hey.

58:42.269 --> 58:44.351
Are you sure you're going to be ok?

58:44.479 --> 58:46.094
Yeah.

58:47.315 --> 58:48.851
Just think of it this way...

58:48.984 --> 58:53.148
next year, we'll both be in college,
and we won't have to worry about it.

58:55.741 --> 58:58.198
I'm not going to college.

58:59.369 --> 59:01.075
What do you mean?

59:02.122 --> 59:04.329
I've been doing some thinking.

59:05.751 --> 59:08.413
What I really want to do
is be a reporter,

59:08.545 --> 59:11.457
not take a bunch of stupid classes.

59:11.590 --> 59:13.330
Look, I understand all that.

59:13.467 --> 59:16.425
You have plenty of time for that
after college.

59:19.014 --> 59:21.801
With everything that's happened,

59:21.933 --> 59:24.265
it's really made me think.

59:25.645 --> 59:28.637
And from now on,
I'm gonna do what I wanna do,

59:28.774 --> 59:31.732
not plan to do what I wanna do.

59:31.860 --> 59:33.100
Ok?

59:34.780 --> 59:36.236
Ok.

59:50.837 --> 59:52.498
Mmh.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:04.386
Debbie, did you take
my nail Polish again?

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:06.133
Debbie?

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.010
You brat!

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:50.060
That's my private property!

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.435
Clippings of murders?

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:57.475
What are you,
some kind of little ghoul?

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.656
I'm showing this to mom.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:07.660
Mom!

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.580
Mom, look at this.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.577
It's not mine.
Curtis left it here.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.717
I don't want Curtis
coming here ever again.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.962
And I want you
playing with him ever again!

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.679
I'm sorry, mommy.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.053
Take this and burn it.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:06.003
Give me that, angel face.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:39.661
<i>Hello?</i>

01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:43.086
Come on over right away,
and bring Steven.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.693
What are you doing in there,
you little creep?

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.821
- Why didn't you wait for us?
- She asked for it.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:48.187
Beverly!
Would you get the phone, please?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.896
It's just the wrong number, mom.
Beverly's gone.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:56.024
Oh, ok. Thanks.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.615
Debbie?

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:45.578
Debbie?

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:49.077
Debbie, what are you doing?

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.500
I spilt some nail Polish, mommy.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:55.925
Honey, you know you shouldn't play
with Beverly's things.

01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:58.136
I'm sorry, mommy.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.879
Ok, but clean it up.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.597
I will

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:05.935
hey. I'm sorry
I got so mad at you earlier.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:07.679
Ok.

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:22.869
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:25.784
- "He leadeth me beside the still water."
- Bev!

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.999
"He restoreth my soul.”

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.994
I never told you...

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.665
I never told you
how much we wanted you.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.754
I love you!

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:40.219
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:43.340
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:47.139
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of my enemies."

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:50.514
Ok. I'll be home in a couple of days,
honey, alright?

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.561
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.565
Thank you.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.759
Want me to fix up the sprinkler for you?

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.679
No, I'll do it.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.510
Are you alright?

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:31.474
Yeah.

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:35.312
Hard to believe that, er...

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:38.899
Beverly's not gonna come walking by.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.367
She'd like to be dead.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.448
You shouldn't think about
things like that.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:56.254
Look, erm... why don't you go get
the pruning shears,

01:08:56.381 --> 01:09:00.045
and we'll get this lawn cleaned up
before mom and dad get home, ok?

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:02.089
Alright. Come on, Maggie!

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.372
Ready, I'm it.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.868
One, two, three,

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:38.082
four, five...
- It's jammed.

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.423
Yeah, I bet Curtis gizmoed it.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.258
You don't even know
what "gizmo" means.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:45.627
Ten.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.099
Tag! You're it.

01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:07.658
I beat you!

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:19.079
My dad put in special glass!

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.046
Get him!

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:42.875
Don't! You'll hurt him!
Let him go!

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:46.841
- Hey! What are you guys doing?
- He was throwing rocks at us!

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.132
- You were choking him, weren't you?
- No, we were just playing.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:53.344
You stay right here, and I'm gonna have
the sheriff come over and talk to you.

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:55.178
Go ahead and call the sheriff.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:59.395
After what you did at the birthday party,
he'll think you're crazy.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:04.267
Let go of me! My grandfather will have
you arrested for assaulting a minor!

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:55.871
Hi.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:59.034
- My mom's back home.
- Oh, great.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:01.452
She'll have to go see a shrink tonight.

01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:03.326
Can you and Timmy
come over and babysit?

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:05.327
Sure, what time do you want me
to come over?

01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:07.793
- Seven o'clock.
- Ok.

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.843
It's bulletproof glass, you idiot.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.696
Joyce!

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:45.874
Joyce!

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.745
Stop!

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:03.055
Timmy! Down here.

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:04.765
Down here!

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.142
We have to unlock the security system
and get out of here.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:29.415
I'm gonna do it.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:50.477
The trunk, Timmy!

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:56.813
Down!

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.414
Timmy!

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:02.382
Timmy, get away!

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:06.929
Ok, let him in!

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:28.993
Let's get sheriff Brody's gun.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.375
It's a replica.

01:19:09.954 --> 01:19:13.162
Should've learned to count to six, genius!

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:26.008
Ok, hold him.

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:41.391
Timmy, go to the Wilsons' house
and call the police.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.790
Let me out!

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:05.335
Yeah, I'll let you out
when the cops get here.

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:25.192
Mommy, mommy, Curtis and Steven
did some terrible things,

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:28.984
and Joyce is going to blame me, too.
- Oh, sweetie, calm down.

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:31.152
Now exactly what happened?

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:33.905
Well, erm...

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:46.390
Beth?

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.273
Beth?

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:52.821
Now, come over here.

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:56.153
Now, what's your name?

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.782
Beth Simpson.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:00.867
Alright.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.867
And remember,
no talking to strangers.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:10.210
I won't, mommy. From now on,
I'm gonna be your good little girl.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:11.759
Ok.
