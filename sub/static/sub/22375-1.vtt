WEBVTT

00:21.188 --> 00:22.678
In the 20th century,

00:23.148 --> 00:25.981
if you wanted to know your neighbors,
you move to the suburbs.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.895
If you wanted to become an addict,
you move to New York.

00:30.989 --> 00:34.607
Now, everything's upside down,
the junkies are in the burbs.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.868
And the building next door
is a fucking kickball league.

00:38.664 --> 00:41.702
It was an' against commerce
and commerce won.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.618
The kids think the only place
to find art is in the gallery.

00:45.796 --> 00:49.755
And the only place to find romance
is to confessing your love in the rain.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.378
Like in the movies.

00:51.843 --> 00:56.087
But it's messier than that.
There's always mess.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.592
It's safe here now,
but there's still urban decay.

01:01.144 --> 01:05.229
It's just, migrated to the dinner parties
of the upper Westside.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.104
The best lack all conviction
while the worst

01:09.236 --> 01:11.603
are filled with passionate intensity.

01:12.364 --> 01:17.279
Yeats said that but so did Lou Reed
Quoting him live at the Bottom Line.

01:18.662 --> 01:22.200
Lou Reed's gone and so is the Bottom Line.

01:22.666 --> 01:27.285
It's probably a Soul Cycle,
only soul the city has left.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.839
Everyone's pretending it's all okay.
But that's a lie.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.626
Something's missing and we all feel it.

01:36.555 --> 01:40.594
Including Thomas Webb,
he thought he had the answer.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.933
And her name was Mimi.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.894
Nineteen seventy-six. The city
was dirty, crime-ridden, and broke.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.067
It was the center
of the creative universe.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.402
New York's lost its soul.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.189
Most favorite neighborhood
at the moment is Philadelphia.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.198
- I like that.
- Yeah?

02:02.331 --> 02:05.449
- Yeah, where'd you lift that from?
- I didn't, it's mine.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.578
Well, it's good.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.828
So, will you come with me tonight?

02:11.965 --> 02:15.333
No, your mum's last dinner party
made me feel invisible.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.756
I know, but, we're invisible together.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.389
- If you don't like it, then you don't go.
- I have to go.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.674
My mother's unstable,
throwing dinner parties

02:23.769 --> 02:26.602
- is how she medicates.
- Yeah, what about the lithium and Xanax?

02:26.938 --> 02:29.726
Not to mention, the nicotine and Shiraz.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.682
Semantics.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.487
- I have to tell you something.
- Yeah?

02:37.783 --> 02:40.275
Yeah, I...

02:41.370 --> 02:46.115
- Might be going to Zagreb.
- Where?

02:46.750 --> 02:48.741
Zagreb, it's in Croatia.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.252
So, Helmut Graph,
he runs a workshop there.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.586
And I found out that
I can transfer my credits to NYU.

02:56.885 --> 03:02.551
That's... That's... terrible.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.675
Why?

03:07.145 --> 03:08.260
No, why is that terrible?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.520
Because you're the only thing
in my life I'm settled on.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.564
Thomas, what do you think is happening?

03:13.276 --> 03:15.483
Between me and you,
what do you think this is?

03:15.612 --> 03:19.901
- August 8th, I think August 8th was real.
- It was amazing.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.195
But it was just one night.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.824
I mean Nick was playing L.A.,
I was vulnerable.

03:27.416 --> 03:31.330
We were both on molly,
I thought I was a pirate.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.463
It was just one night.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.800
Well, I'm crazy about you.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.592
- And I'm crazy about you but...
- But, don't say as friends.

03:43.724 --> 03:47.058
- Why? Why is that so bad?
- Because pretty girls like to recruit

03:47.144 --> 03:48.634
their rejections and call them friends.

03:51.857 --> 03:52.938
Wow.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.668
For Mimi,
Thomas was like the new New York.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.011
No danger, no deliverance.

04:25.849 --> 04:29.433
It made him nurturing
and too boring to fall in love with.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.145
Mimi felt Thomas
was a boy without mystery.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.647
Thomas agreed.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.438
But all that was about to change.

05:02.803 --> 05:07.388
- Anything worth opening?
- Just bills and junk.

05:10.644 --> 05:16.560
W.F., W.F. Gerald I just moved into 2B.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.853
Thomas Webb.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.233
- Why so troubled, Thomas?
- Excuse me.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.148
I know that color of stress.

05:26.535 --> 05:31.325
It's much brighter than job issues,
more subdued than possible disease.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.120
- Sorry, I'm being rude.
- No, I mean...

05:38.296 --> 05:39.331
I'm having a bad day.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.376
What's her name?

05:46.137 --> 05:48.799
- It's Mimi.
- Mimi.

05:49.391 --> 05:53.055
Derived from Wilhelmina,
It means resolute protector.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.428
There you go.

05:57.816 --> 06:01.605
What a...
what is it you like about this Mimi?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.152
You're a psychiatrist?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.318
- No.
- You ask psychiatrist questions.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.941
Maybe I can help.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.449
Maybe I can help you
to get Mimi to sleep with you.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.581
How do you know, she hasn't already?

06:30.432 --> 06:31.718
It was nice meeting you.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.219
Well, why don't you let a new
neighbor help you out?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.357
What do you like about Mimi?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.322
I'm in 2B.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.023
Where'd you meet her?

07:24.653 --> 07:27.771
There's this book store
called The Pale Fire.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.446
- It's named after John Shade...
- John Shade's 999 line poem.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.159
Nabokov.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.156
Right, well.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.572
They sold rare, vintage books in there.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.619
And I'm into that.
Just reading off the beaten back and...

07:41.294 --> 07:44.252
Mimi works there,
she gave me the greatest recommendations.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.417
You know.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.082
She's putting herself
through NYU's writing program.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.052
- She reads a book a week.
- She's polishing her brain.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.346
Beautiful?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.141
Incredibly beautiful.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.770
Like she's direct from God, you know.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.143
On second generation,
if that makes sense.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.732
Don't believe sense.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.859
You know we get each other.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.646
Problem, was...

08:13.535 --> 08:16.243
ls, that she has this boyfriend.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.904
Nick, he's in that...

08:19.582 --> 08:21.448
band, Fahrenheit 185.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.080
The exact temperature
it takes to cook heroin.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.670
Properly.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.760
Let's see what we got.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.847
Here we go.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.690
Anyways, so, Nick goes on tour.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.144
Mimi's now available
and we're hanging out more.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.862
We end up spending...

08:54.034 --> 08:55.274
a magical night together.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.445
August 8th, and then...

09:01.583 --> 09:04.291
Nothing. All goes platonic.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.327
How old is Mimi?

09:07.672 --> 09:09.913
She's, 22. She just turned 22.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.753
She's young. Well...

09:12.802 --> 09:17.467
she's at an age,
where defense mechanisms are very strong.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.804
Despite her outer veneer,
she's ruled by fear.

09:21.519 --> 09:25.683
Like so many of us at that time.
I know... what you need to do.

09:26.941 --> 09:31.481
Just make her afraid of something more
than being with you, in that way.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.645
Which is?

09:36.326 --> 09:37.441
Not being with you.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.781
But how?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.742
How I am supposed to do that?

09:44.334 --> 09:46.291
Let life take over,

09:48.797 --> 09:51.209
find a window and pounce.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.135
That's it?
That's you sage-ably advice?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.843
- Can I have my money back, please?
- Thomas.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.554
- Is it Thomas or Tom?
- It's Thomas.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.889
- Not Tommy?
- No, never.

10:06.397 --> 10:09.480
Thomas, you're not giving life
enough credit.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.771
The unpredictable forces of humanity...

10:12.153 --> 10:15.942
My life is not unpredictable,
my life is conventional my life is boring.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.529
No, it's as random as it is deliberate.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.074
It's funny as it is tragic.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.951
Yours is no exception. I gotta piss.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.965
Dinner parties
were Judith's safety blanket.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.138
A table full of artists
took her mind of her herself.

10:42.433 --> 10:46.768
The swirl of distractions,
seating plans, gossip, food,

10:47.063 --> 10:48.929
anything to keep away the dread.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.725
They were the perfect antidote
to her childhood dinners.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.398
The silences, the drunken outbursts.

10:55.864 --> 10:59.107
Artists came to New York from all over,
and she always took them in.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.693
Clinging to the illusion
of an open happy family.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.696
Do you miss getting mugged
on Central Park West...

11:05.790 --> 11:08.407
- Exactly, exactly.
- No, but I do miss,

11:08.751 --> 11:11.869
the second avenue deli,
I miss the Lenox Lounge.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.248
I mean do you know,
what are in those iconic places now.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.541
Urban Outfitters, a Starbucks.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.461
There's a John Varvatos
where CBGB's use to be.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.925
- New York's lost its soul.
- Exactly!

11:24.475 --> 11:25.556
What was that Thomas?

11:26.978 --> 11:30.767
Well, I was just agreeing with David
that New York has lost its soul.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.775
Since he returned from 3 months in Peru,
he's decided to hate where he's from.

11:34.903 --> 11:35.938
No, it's true.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.896
New York's most vibrant neighborhood
at the moment is Philadelphia.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.696
That's very funny, Thomas.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.283
So, Ethan. I heard you've commissioned
Nick Bilton

11:47.415 --> 11:49.031
to write the biography on Evan Dereif.

11:49.250 --> 11:53.164
Our mandate, it came to us very simple.
Bios on any haircut under 40,

11:53.296 --> 11:55.458
as long as they're still
within their fifteen minutes.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.543
Self-help, political rants.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.626
- Nobody reads fiction anymore.
- Anyone's a writer...

12:01.346 --> 12:03.758
- so cynical, Ethan Webb.
- I know...

12:04.140 --> 12:05.972
If I were a writer,

12:06.059 --> 12:08.767
we'd be having this conversation
in a two bedroom in Bushwick.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.848
Bushwick is expensive now.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.814
I'm serious, I'm really serious,
I mean, most novelists these days,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.559
they don't own enough money
to support themselves.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.356
No matter how talented they are.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.318
That's why if Thomas came to me
with a desire to be writer.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.779
I'd talk him out of it.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.114
So, you're still tutoring, right?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.666
Yeah, just for some extra cash.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.792
- He could be a Spanish teacher.
- Yes, he actually could.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.962
- I don't know if I could be a Spanish...
- If you went back to collage for a year.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.877
For some reason he refuses to do it.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.422
He lives on the lower east side
without any direction.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.087
Only thing missing is an opium habit.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.885
What about doing a smartphone application?

13:29.058 --> 13:30.890
This man moved in
across the hall from me.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.930
I don't what he does, or who he is but,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.178
Seems familiar to me.

13:35.606 --> 13:36.641
He's my new friend.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.022
Yeah.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.727
- He asked about you.
- Me? He knows me.

13:49.787 --> 13:50.902
What's my father doing here?

13:55.585 --> 13:56.700
Who's he with?

13:58.588 --> 13:59.703
I don't know.

14:01.716 --> 14:02.831
She's beautiful.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.992
Do you have any idea
what this is gonna do to my mother?

14:37.627 --> 14:40.210
This doesn't mean
your father loves you any less.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.457
I'm sorry, that was bad enough.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.048
I know like dispensing therapy
from an after-school specialist...

14:49.180 --> 14:51.467
He doesn't care about me
to begin with I know that.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.222
This... this is about my mother.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.100
Yeah, but, it's their problem.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.181
- You have your own problems.
- Like what?

15:02.276 --> 15:05.439
Actually don't, don't answer that.
Not now.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.024
Thomas, look at me.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.653
Look, your parents,

15:15.456 --> 15:16.491
their world,

15:17.250 --> 15:18.866
is nothing like ours.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.623
I mean maybe it's their generation or...

15:25.758 --> 15:27.294
I don't know this island.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.419
But you're kind.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.135
And you're real.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.398
Don't do that.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.368
Mimi, look, you're young,

16:03.129 --> 16:05.791
and your defense mechanism is strong,
but I think that you want this.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.967
- I think that you're confused right now.
- No Mimi, I'm angry right now.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.170
I'm angry.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.847
Did you see that woman?
Did you see how beautiful she was?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.889
I could never get a woman like that.

16:20.646 --> 16:25.231
My father with his publishing house,
his good looks, and it's cheating...

16:26.152 --> 16:27.187
fucking hair.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.068
So what, you're gonna use

16:30.156 --> 16:33.490
your father's affairs as a confirmation
of your own inadequacies?

16:36.704 --> 16:37.785
No, I mean.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.497
I have you for that.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.412
So, you call my office,

16:47.798 --> 16:50.130
you say you wanna have lunch,
you never wanna have lunch.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.834
I figured you had a big surprise.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.215
- Maybe you figured out your life.
- No.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.130
Definitely haven't figured out my life.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.467
- I wanted to speak to you about...
- Ethan.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.560
- Good to see you.
- Of course anytime.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.641
- I actually enjoyed the show.
- It was good, wasn't it?

17:04.732 --> 17:06.314
- It was great.
- Great, say hi to Judith.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.973
I will indeed.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.020
I want you to move
from the lower east side.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.824
Why do you insist on living in the
farthest corner of Manhattan away from us?

17:17.244 --> 17:18.326
I think it's intentional.

17:19.454 --> 17:22.071
I think it's almost hurtful.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.032
Look.

17:26.337 --> 17:29.125
I'm not asking for me,
I'm asking for your mother.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.877
She wants you closer to home.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.296
How is mom?

17:36.013 --> 17:37.003
Better.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.881
I guess.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.345
- Can't get her to quit smoking.
- She is fragile.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.395
Anything, even the smallest thing could,
create another,

17:50.570 --> 17:51.605
incident.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.492
I'll pay the difference in rent.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.075
Will you think about it?

18:07.962 --> 18:09.498
- Dad.
- Also, I setup an appointment

18:09.630 --> 18:12.748
with a career counselor for you.
My office will email you the info.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.467
Dad, I know you, I know...

18:15.970 --> 18:17.426
You know I'm what, Thomas?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.464
I know you're just trying to help.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.849
Don't blow it up, okay?

18:24.312 --> 18:26.223
I had to call in a favor for her
to see you,

18:26.355 --> 18:27.470
she actually has a waiting list.

18:30.484 --> 18:34.569
- Are you gonna confront your father?
- No, trouble talking to him.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.563
Why?

18:37.617 --> 18:38.948
I don't think, he likes me that much.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.197
What the...

18:44.248 --> 18:46.285
What exactly is wrong with your mother?

18:48.002 --> 18:50.334
I don't know, she's depressed. Bipolar.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.291
She's depressive bipolar.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.836
She came from a broken home, so.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.335
Whenever anything threatens
our perfect family,

18:59.472 --> 19:01.338
she, completely unravels.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.889
Can't tell her, she'd be destroyed.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.222
Why don't you furnished this place?

19:12.360 --> 19:13.771
I live in Brooklyn.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.105
- You have two apartments?
- I'm rich.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.445
I'm a fucking duke.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.377
Maybe he's,
been faithful all these years.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.664
Maybe she came on to him,
I've seen her, she's irresistible.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.128
- I mean...
- Alright, stop.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.888
- What do you want?
- Well, my father stop seeing this woman.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.015
No, no, no, in life?

19:47.687 --> 19:48.802
You know, in your life.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.477
You want more money?
You want more respect?

19:56.404 --> 19:57.735
What is that you want?

19:59.782 --> 20:02.319
Think about it, really think about it.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.866
- I wanna be better.
- Better?

20:08.332 --> 20:09.322
In what?

20:16.006 --> 20:16.996
I don't know.

20:19.427 --> 20:23.261
In the 80's, Ethan was intoxicated
by literary New York.

20:23.931 --> 20:27.925
But when he accepted that he lacked
the talent to create a fictional family,

20:28.018 --> 20:30.680
he thought, at least he could create
a real one.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.804
Young Thomas loved to write.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.514
Ethan ignored this.

20:35.067 --> 20:39.061
Wary of nurturing a life of rejections
and evictions.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.946
And Thomas learned
to keep his stories to himself.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.320
The intensity of Judith's bond
with her son,

20:45.411 --> 20:48.324
left Ethan feeling like a stranger
in his own home.

20:49.623 --> 20:54.038
He sought refuge in work,
until publishing began its slow decline.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.419
Then came Johanna.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.961
You know, private detectives
get paid by the hour.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.467
To just, just wait.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.255
To do exactly what we're doing right now.
What is the difficulty in a stakeout?

21:11.479 --> 21:12.514
I really gotta go to class.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.809
No, just wait, all right?
He's gonna be out in a minute.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.600
I have to see
if he's gonna meet her again.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.568
Please.

21:21.489 --> 21:22.524
Just wait.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.198
Okay.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.367
My God, that's her.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.452
The other woman.

21:36.754 --> 21:37.835
I'll call you later.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.204
- Wait, aren't we waiting for your dad.
- I'll call you later.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.778
What is it exactly
that you wanna accomplish?

23:28.282 --> 23:29.397
I wanna meet her.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.774
I wanna tell her to stop seeing my father.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.362
- She could kill my mother.
- So, do it.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.703
I haven't built up the courage yet.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.872
- So you stalk her.
- I shouldn't be dealing with this at all.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.378
I should be on a beach,

23:49.428 --> 23:50.418
With Mimi.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.087
Naked.

23:54.934 --> 23:55.924
In Croatia.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.681
We should be together, together.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.596
Should is a dangerous word.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.188
I'm serious, man.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.728
If it wasn't for my mother,
I wouldn't be here.

24:08.906 --> 24:09.987
I don't buy it.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.399
You don't buy what?

24:15.037 --> 24:17.825
I don't buy that this is just about
your mother's health.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.994
You have something more here.

24:22.503 --> 24:23.493
Something more what?

24:25.214 --> 24:26.295
Provocative.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.510
Excuse me.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.724
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.974
- You don't know who I am.
- Yes, I do.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.898
- You do?
- You're the boy who follows me.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.776
- Yeah, well, I have a good reason.
- You're also Ethan's son.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.359
He keeps a picture of you on his desk.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.491
Are you hungry, Thomas?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.921
Following someone
in this city got to be very difficult.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.470
It's so easy to be anonymous here.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.098
Why didn't you say anything
when I was following you?

25:19.852 --> 25:20.842
Why didn't you say anything?

25:21.186 --> 25:22.597
Because I didn't know what I was gonna do.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.554
- And do you now?
- Yes.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.477
Is it good?

25:32.322 --> 25:34.108
- Johanna.
- Johanna?

25:34.908 --> 25:36.819
- I'm Johanna.
- Okay, Johanna.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.780
How long have you been fucking my father?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.703
Okay, is that kind of vulgarity
entirely necessary?

25:40.956 --> 25:42.367
What kind of vulgarity would you prefer?

25:46.045 --> 25:47.251
A little bit over a year.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.628
Why are you even seeing him?
He's married.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.214
He is married.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.211
- Do you work with him?
- Sometimes.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.929
I'm a freelance editor, so,

25:59.600 --> 26:00.761
I work for all the houses.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.434
Do you love him?

26:07.232 --> 26:08.222
Define love, Thomas.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.183
Do you think you're gonna marry him?

26:10.652 --> 26:13.360
Is that the plan, you think you're
gonna steal him away from my mother?

26:14.907 --> 26:16.864
How do you know
your mother isn't giving him to me?

26:18.619 --> 26:21.862
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean, people do things all the time

26:22.122 --> 26:23.112
without realizing.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.865
Your mother may be giving me Ethan
without comprehending it.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.957
You're doing something right now,
without realizing it.

26:32.382 --> 26:33.497
Yeah, what I'm doing?

26:34.843 --> 26:37.210
- You're trying to make love to me.
- I'm trying to make love to...

26:39.014 --> 26:40.220
I'm trying to make love to you?

26:42.768 --> 26:43.883
You just don't realize it.

26:47.481 --> 26:51.600
Andy Warhol was a close personal friend
and he gave us that piece as a gift.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.898
And now this God damn committee.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.738
- Is going to take all that away.
- Mom, it doesn't really matter.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.900
These people, these nonentities in Chelsea
their trying to steal my past,

27:00.994 --> 27:02.780
- they're trying to erase my memories.
- Mom!

27:04.873 --> 27:05.988
We're gonna find the photo.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.167
Look at this mess.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.621
I need a cigarette.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.796
But your father has declared

27:17.886 --> 27:19.923
I'm no longer allowed
to smoke in the house, so...

27:20.722 --> 27:22.679
I'll stay here and keep searching.

27:26.687 --> 27:29.224
Thomas, I wanna smoke
and talk to you at the same time.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.181
- It makes the cigarette better.
- Okay.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.433
Thank you.

27:37.781 --> 27:41.991
It's just this perpetual cycle
of expectations and disappointments.

27:44.997 --> 27:48.080
You know, the farthest distance
in the world,

27:49.209 --> 27:52.497
is between how it is
and how you thought it was gonna be.

27:54.006 --> 27:54.996
Don't forget that.

27:56.842 --> 27:57.832
I won't.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.795
You're my light, Thomas.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.339
You know.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.141
I don't know what I'd do without you.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.439
It's this Klonopin.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.109
- It makes me so fucking emotional.
- You're fine.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.368
Why don't you stop seeing my father?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.112
Hello, Thomas.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.915
You're a very beautiful woman,
you can get any man you want in this city.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.825
Can I get you?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.036
What?

28:35.631 --> 28:38.123
You said I can get any man in this city,
so I'm asking.

28:38.884 --> 28:39.919
Can I get you?

28:41.011 --> 28:42.547
Which actually begs
another question really.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.716
Are you a man?

28:45.432 --> 28:46.843
My mother's in a fragile state.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.633
- This affair could put her over the top.
- How am I responsible for your mother...

28:49.770 --> 28:52.478
- Because you're fucking my father.
- crudeness doesn't make one a man.

28:52.606 --> 28:54.563
- Stop seeing him.
- Nor do demands.

28:54.858 --> 28:55.973
I'm not trying to be a man.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.601
I'm not trying to make love to you,
I'm trying to save my mother.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.315
You're getting closer.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.323
Johanna wasn't raised by writers.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.242
She was raised by bankers.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.041
But the lingua franca both is fiction.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.624
When Ethan floated the idea
of leaving his wife,

29:21.760 --> 29:23.296
she assumed it was just talk.

29:24.721 --> 29:28.589
But to her surprise,
his suggestion unbalanced her.

29:30.602 --> 29:34.345
Instead of feeling flattered
she felt suddenly, needy.

29:35.148 --> 29:39.733
Thomas's attention was the perfect remedy
to her rattled confidence.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.357
The visions of Johanna.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.981
She's not like anyone I've ever met.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.819
She said I was trying to make love to her.

29:50.664 --> 29:51.904
Well, were you?

29:54.001 --> 29:55.583
No, I wanted her to stop seeing my father.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.954
Isn't that between you and your father.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.797
Why would you wanna make contact with her?

30:04.428 --> 30:08.171
She's an outsider
to what seems to me to be a family issue.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.508
Eat that.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.013
It's good.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.145
- What was it?
- You don't wanna know.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.397
So what are you saying?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.187
- I like dealing with her?
- That's precisely what I'm saying.

30:24.406 --> 30:25.737
And that I wanna make love to her?

30:26.366 --> 30:28.357
- Would you like to make love to her?
- No!

30:31.371 --> 30:33.078
What kind of question is that? Sick!

30:33.790 --> 30:35.246
- How is that sick?
- It's sick.

30:35.751 --> 30:36.991
She's a beautiful woman.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.372
- So?
- Her name is Johanna.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.002
She's sleeping with my father.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.670
- Would you like to make love to Johanna?
- Would you give me some credit, please?

30:46.303 --> 30:48.214
- This conversation's perverse.
- Answer the question.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.420
Give me some credit.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.718
Stop drowning yourself
in what you think is moral.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.757
Do you wanna fuck Johanna?

31:01.318 --> 31:02.308
Yes.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.612
- I would.
- You said your life was boring.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.848
I couldn't have handled today without you.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.639
You know, I got hit on three times
coming from the bathroom.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.102
I'm pretty sure they're all married.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.604
It's a good thing my father isn't here.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.768
That's not funny.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.058
No.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.019
- The groom is coming.
- It's my ninja.

31:46.530 --> 31:49.022
It's my motherfucking ninja.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.815
- Congratulation, man!
- Thanks, man!

31:51.076 --> 31:52.191
This is Mimi. Howard.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.283
- Nice to meet you.
- Congrats.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.577
Listen! I've been running
through Riverside Park, every day.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.947
Nine miles, murdering sobriety.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.869
I've seen a lot your mother,
lately actually.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.125
- My mother?
- Yeah, yeah. I don't know,

32:02.254 --> 32:04.666
she's always on the same bench
reading a book.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.710
It's Irwin, Irwin.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.675
You guys gotta meet Irwin Sanders,
he's buying the Knicks.

32:09.970 --> 32:12.428
Howard, hoes does it feel being married?

32:12.556 --> 32:13.671
Sex already sucks.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.634
Kidding, kind of.

32:16.226 --> 32:19.059
Condé Nast, took me back actually, so...

32:19.229 --> 32:20.845
Maybe anyway,
I can get an interview at some point.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.062
Maybe.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.649
Howard, this is my friend Johanna.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.651
- Hello, congratulations.
- Thank you.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.190
This is Thomas.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.363
- Johanna.
- Mimi.

32:31.575 --> 32:32.565
Hi.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.326
You're being really obvious.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.017
I'm not dating Irwin.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.807
It's none of your business.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.818
I don't have to explain myself to you,
but none the less.

33:11.448 --> 33:12.609
He's a very good friend.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.117
- Where's your girlfriend?
- She's not.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.450
She's just a friend.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.207
You shouldn't let her do that to you.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.125
He's 30 years older than you,
he's a billionaire.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.845
- I'm not stupid.
- You are quite stupid, Thomas.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.261
And you've got no idea
how the world works.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.477
And actually
he's not a billionaire anymore.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.642
- You cannot see the path of everything.
- Doesn't really matter.

33:46.066 --> 33:47.181
No, it doesn't.

33:49.903 --> 33:50.893
You look nice.

33:52.906 --> 33:53.987
You look very nice.

33:54.741 --> 33:55.776
In a suit.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.276
I don't really think you're stupid.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.202
Just

34:01.790 --> 34:02.825
confused.

34:03.875 --> 34:04.910
Young.

34:07.712 --> 34:08.918
Irwin's probably looking for you.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.253
- I'm sure he paid for the whole night.
- Fuck you, really.

34:19.683 --> 34:20.717
Hey.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.094
- So, first of all, hooker comments.
- I know, I'm sorry.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.389
- You actually resorted to hooker comments?
- I'm sorry.

34:25.855 --> 34:26.969
- I apologize.
- Okay.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.561
Second of all, Irwin's gay.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.145
Okay, he loves men.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.231
In fact he loves one man in particular.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.772
A man named Billy Analdi,
who happens to be an incredible art dealer

34:35.907 --> 34:37.272
and one of my closes friends.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.150
So, Irwin doesn't want to come out
for business reasons,

34:40.286 --> 34:42.870
which is his prerogative,
and I come to events like this with him.

34:43.373 --> 34:46.331
I'm not a glorified hooker,
he's not a sugar daddy, I'm his beard.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.958
You really don't know how the world works.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.623
You're innocent,
Thomas, you're a child.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.549
- I know somethings.
- Yeah?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.129
Like what?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.467
How it went down.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.638
- You, my dad, I know.
- Do you?

35:07.939 --> 35:12.399
Okay Thomas,
Mr. Ace Sleuth, I wanna hear it.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.818
You noticed that he liked
to come in early.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.117
Really early like, what?

35:22.954 --> 35:24.069
Seven in the morning?

35:24.873 --> 35:27.911
So, you started coming in then, too,
isolate and contain.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.334
Told him
it was because you don't sleep well,

35:30.670 --> 35:33.332
with the bad dreams,
they shake you awake before daylight.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.623
In the mornings,
you put on music in your office.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.716
Browns one day, Biggie Smalls the next,

35:37.886 --> 35:39.718
because, you know,
you can't be put into a box.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.049
You attack all the senses.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.180
You went a little aggressive
on your signature scent.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.049
Strong on the vanilla.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.431
You mention a boyfriend,
then complain of a bad date,

35:49.648 --> 35:51.138
you confuse him, you make him wonder.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.061
The sex.

35:54.861 --> 35:56.852
The sex, the sex surprise you both.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.942
And he was just walking you home
after dinner.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.525
Well, Jesus, you're not the other woman.
He's not a cheating husband.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.328
No, this isn't something we did,
this is something that happened to us.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.823
But what? Could it be love?

36:09.793 --> 36:12.205
No. Nobody wants to acknowledge that,
so soon in the game,

36:12.295 --> 36:14.912
but stars are crossed
and people are gonna get hurt, and,

36:15.757 --> 36:18.215
we've done a bad, bad thing, Ethan,
so fuck, it must be right.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.552
And all of it was just bullshit,
calculated and manipulated

36:22.847 --> 36:25.305
from that first lie about your bad dreams.
'Cause I'm...

36:26.601 --> 36:30.139
I'm pretty sure
that you sleep like a baby.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.188
You are quite a story teller.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.646
- Where have you been?
- Bathroom, drank too much.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.027
I have to interrupt now because,

37:22.407 --> 37:23.488
I have to go home.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.072
I'm Uncle Buster.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.370
Let's get out of here.

37:31.374 --> 37:34.457
- They haven't even cut the cake.
- Fuck the cake. Let's go.

37:34.627 --> 37:35.617
What?

37:35.837 --> 37:36.827
- Why?
- Come on.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.203
Walter's not here because.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.747
- You smell like vanilla.
- He's doing two to five.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.128
It's no secret.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.297
'Cause, you all know, two to five,

37:45.680 --> 37:47.091
for doing the right thing.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.307
For believing in the poetry
of the constitution.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.638
I have only a few thoughts.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.308
Drama.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.274
Dramatics of marital romance.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.197
Staying together.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.073
Like the gypsy...

38:10.747 --> 38:12.112
told me the poems,

38:12.749 --> 38:15.286
written in life lines
are never guaranteed.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.910
They get busted up.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.126
Its moral begins new poetry.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.968
Another romance that will explode

38:27.222 --> 38:28.428
from time to time.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.261
Poetry of married people, like,

38:33.061 --> 38:34.722
the Aurora Borealis.

38:37.065 --> 38:40.183
Strewn like stars in the sky

38:40.902 --> 38:43.360
and the drama of your lives begins.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.522
Chapter after chapter.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.240
Stories.

38:49.577 --> 38:50.612
Books.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.198
Revolutions,

38:53.540 --> 38:55.122
as I know, will come.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.749
I've seen many, lived through them.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.630
They play in the least expected places.
So get ready.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.509
Casey understands Howard.
Howard,

39:09.222 --> 39:10.508
knows Casey.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.179
No. No, not yet.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.227
There's always mystery.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.845
You both know that.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.893
You both know it isn't perfect.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.149
Excitement.

39:23.611 --> 39:24.646
Trust.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.270
And struggle.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.073
And the unknown privacies.

39:30.952 --> 39:32.283
That keep us together.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.444
Glue of struggle.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.456
I raise my glass.

39:40.545 --> 39:43.162
Fragile glass who was
stumped on and shattered.

39:44.424 --> 39:47.007
And we'll forever
be putting back together.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.042
Like the puzzles,

39:49.387 --> 39:50.877
we first worked as children.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.930
Learning to be patient.

39:55.518 --> 39:56.849
Searching for what fits.

40:01.733 --> 40:02.768
So many puzzles.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.394
So many books in this room.

40:12.285 --> 40:13.366
I talk too much.

40:14.621 --> 40:15.782
Let's dance.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.459
So I have to, go to this career counselor.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.670
My father setup the appointment.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.429
Why don't you go into journalism?
You were in the high school newspaper.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.101
It doesn't interest me anymore.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.017
And you won the advertising prize
in college, you could do that.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.102
How do you this about me?

40:45.318 --> 40:46.900
- How do you know all this?
- I know everything.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.226
Everything about you.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.737
Okay, yeah, but can we see?

40:50.907 --> 40:52.489
- President of the debate club.
- Yeah.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.528
Arts editor of the high school newspaper.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.568
Second single on the tennis team.

40:56.871 --> 40:57.986
Very impressive, Thomas.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.415
Your father has all your awards
on his desk.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.790
- So awful.
- That's awkward.

41:06.714 --> 41:07.954
For the career counselor.

41:10.927 --> 41:12.338
Alright, here's something you don't know.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.093
And nobody knows.

41:14.681 --> 41:15.796
Okay.

41:18.935 --> 41:20.221
I wanted to write.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.268
I used to write all these things
when I was younger.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.900
A bunch of letters from my dog to like

41:29.320 --> 41:30.355
the mail man.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.522
The vet. Eventually I...

41:34.617 --> 41:36.949
came up with a collection of essays
called,

41:37.453 --> 41:38.909
"Mary Jane Versus Everything".

41:40.498 --> 41:41.909
Which I was incredibly proud of.

41:42.458 --> 41:45.291
And, you know, I show them to my dad.

41:46.629 --> 41:47.869
What did Ethan say?

41:49.048 --> 41:50.083
Serviceable.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.965
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.878
Serviceable, that was his exact word.

41:57.098 --> 41:58.930
Nothing special, just serviceable.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.845
He seemed pretty angry
after reading them though.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.722
- Well, I wanna read them.
- You do?

42:04.063 --> 42:05.269
- Yeah.
- You can't.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.846
- Why not?
- Because I threw them out.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.598
That's so sad.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.440
That's so sad of an ending.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.740
That's good.

42:19.454 --> 42:20.489
Really?

42:22.040 --> 42:23.656
What word did your father use?

42:25.460 --> 42:27.622
- Serviceable.
- I disagree.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.252
I think you've got talent.

42:35.762 --> 42:38.174
But, your father is a publisher
and I'm just some,

42:39.265 --> 42:42.257
strange neighbor,
so you're gonna go with serviceable.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.722
- Johanna wanted to read them.
- Right.

42:48.858 --> 42:51.816
- I don't know if I could...
- Those visions of Johanna.

42:53.321 --> 42:54.436
I think about her...

42:57.742 --> 42:58.732
all the time.

43:03.331 --> 43:04.321
Maybe it's love.

43:08.544 --> 43:09.579
I don't know.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.249
Love is hard to determine.

43:12.507 --> 43:15.841
People think they're in love
and it's something completely different.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.334
Infatuation.

43:19.722 --> 43:21.633
The righting of childhood wrongs.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.340
No companionship.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.139
Have you ever been in love?

43:27.855 --> 43:29.016
Yeah, once.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.440
Who was she?

43:35.404 --> 43:37.020
She was this woman I knew.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.195
She was taken by someone else,
a dear friend.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.867
We had a profound connection,
but she was his girl.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.198
It was a mess.

43:49.377 --> 43:50.412
So what did you do?

43:50.920 --> 43:52.877
I left the scene of the crime.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.421
You ran away?

43:56.384 --> 43:59.752
Well, at the time
I called it an adventure.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.800
But hindsight turned
it into something else

44:02.932 --> 44:05.344
which is what hindsight inevitably does.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.722
Yeah, I ran away.
I'm gonna take this.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.888
- Leave you with your heart on.
- My hard on.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.936
Heart, your heart on.

44:15.778 --> 44:16.893
You know what, maybe,

44:17.029 --> 44:20.021
in hindsight I'll feel guilty
about Johanna, but right now I don't.

44:24.287 --> 44:25.322
It's not cut or dry.

44:26.247 --> 44:27.863
Congratulations, Thomas.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.204
Your world's becoming contextual.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.339
Who the fuck are you?

44:50.062 --> 44:51.143
Hey dad.

44:52.315 --> 44:53.350
What's up?

44:54.233 --> 44:55.268
Sit down.

45:00.448 --> 45:01.438
Is everything alright?

45:02.241 --> 45:03.322
Is mom okay?

45:04.285 --> 45:05.446
Sit down, Thomas.

45:19.425 --> 45:20.915
Is there anything you want
to tell me?

45:25.389 --> 45:26.424
No.

45:26.974 --> 45:28.009
No, nothing.

45:29.435 --> 45:30.550
Anything I should know?

45:35.441 --> 45:36.431
No.

45:38.611 --> 45:39.601
Thomas...

45:41.072 --> 45:43.359
You blew off the career counselor.

45:45.785 --> 45:48.026
I told you how hard it was
to get that appointment

45:48.120 --> 45:49.736
and then you just don't show up.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.036
- Gone!
- Right, I'm...

45:54.335 --> 45:56.918
- I should have called. Sorry.
- You should have called. I'm sorry.

45:57.129 --> 45:58.210
I'm sorry, too.

46:02.969 --> 46:04.084
Come work here.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.253
Work here. You like to read.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.631
I've been conflicted about
giving you a job here,

46:09.767 --> 46:11.758
nepotism and all that bullshit,
but screw it.

46:12.812 --> 46:15.930
You can start under the junior editors.
You know, learn something.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.271
- No, thank you.
- Why not?

46:17.692 --> 46:19.774
I mean what's wrong with
learning the publishing business?

46:19.860 --> 46:21.601
Nothing. It's fine.
It's just it's...

46:23.823 --> 46:24.813
Serviceable.

46:35.668 --> 46:36.703
W.F.?

46:38.921 --> 46:40.207
I just wanna get my essays back.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.630
Hey.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.313
Thomas.

47:45.780 --> 47:46.941
I was in your apartment.

47:51.118 --> 47:52.199
You're Julian Stellars.

47:54.789 --> 47:56.029
A nom de plume.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.285
You've had twelve books published.

47:59.794 --> 48:02.286
You don't have much mass appeal,
but you don't seem to mind.

48:03.506 --> 48:05.247
Hard to find a picture of you anywhere.

48:06.592 --> 48:09.175
You're an alcoholic who spends
most afternoons drinking

48:09.345 --> 48:10.460
in Brooklyn Inn.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.300
And you're probably the only person
I've met that's actually,

48:14.016 --> 48:15.723
actually been to an opium den.

48:17.812 --> 48:19.143
Have I been googled?

48:25.444 --> 48:26.525
I didn't read it.

48:28.572 --> 48:29.607
The new manuscript.

48:33.369 --> 48:35.485
Well, Thomas, I appreciate that.

48:42.628 --> 48:43.663
So...

48:46.757 --> 48:47.872
You said I had talent.

48:49.552 --> 48:51.463
It was a professional's opinion.

48:55.307 --> 48:57.173
I don't know, man. I...

48:58.686 --> 49:01.428
You've experienced the world.
I just live here in New York.

49:02.398 --> 49:03.809
New York is the world.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.480
I haven't done much with my life.

49:09.572 --> 49:12.109
You've had sex
with your father's mistress?

49:14.076 --> 49:15.441
I'd say that's something.

49:18.289 --> 49:19.871
Am I the only living boy in New York?

49:26.130 --> 49:27.165
You are.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.978
Hey. I was outside your apartment.

49:48.611 --> 49:52.275
You're not there, I brought the essays.
I wanted to show you.

50:32.780 --> 50:33.861
Did you sleep with her?

50:38.994 --> 50:39.984
With who?

50:44.291 --> 50:45.497
Johanna?

50:47.086 --> 50:48.201
Why would you ask that?

50:49.922 --> 50:51.708
They left the wedding
as quickly as we did.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.625
I may be oblivious but I am not stupid.

50:56.428 --> 50:57.884
- Why do you care?
- I just do.

50:58.013 --> 50:59.174
- Why?
- Thomas.

51:00.474 --> 51:01.930
- You jealous?
- No.

51:02.393 --> 51:03.508
- You sure?
- Thomas.

51:04.186 --> 51:05.176
I think you are jealous.

51:05.271 --> 51:07.353
- Did you sleep with her?
- She's my father's mistress.

51:09.275 --> 51:10.436
You think that I would do that?

51:13.487 --> 51:14.568
No.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.108
Thank you.

51:19.159 --> 51:20.194
You're sweet.

51:21.328 --> 51:22.443
You're not like them.

51:23.289 --> 51:25.121
- Like who?
- The city.

51:34.383 --> 51:35.748
I want you to stop seeing him.

51:38.304 --> 51:39.544
No, I'm putting my foot down.

51:40.222 --> 51:41.929
You don't get to tell me what
to do, Thomas.

51:42.057 --> 51:44.924
- I don't care if your foot's down or up.
- Why, cause you don't care about anything?

51:45.227 --> 51:46.433
- What?
- You obviously don't

51:46.604 --> 51:47.810
care about anything at all.

51:48.564 --> 51:50.100
So, I'm a nihilist now, am I?

51:54.653 --> 51:55.768
I don't know anything about you.

51:58.574 --> 51:59.564
Where did you grow up?

52:00.451 --> 52:02.362
Brooklyn, Thomas.
That's why I have this accent.

52:05.331 --> 52:06.446
Did you play sports?

52:07.291 --> 52:08.281
No.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.034
When did you first have sex?

52:12.921 --> 52:15.504
My God,
are we gonna talk about my childhood now?

52:15.841 --> 52:17.127
Yeah, I wanna know you.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.047
Where did you grow up?

52:21.972 --> 52:23.633
I grew up in London.

52:24.391 --> 52:25.472
Which part?

52:26.477 --> 52:27.558
Belsize Park.

52:29.355 --> 52:31.096
Then, Kilburn.

52:31.398 --> 52:32.479
Why the move?

52:33.609 --> 52:36.021
Because Kilburn is so much more real.

52:37.363 --> 52:38.398
What your dad do?

52:42.076 --> 52:43.237
What does your dad do?

52:43.494 --> 52:47.032
He put a gun in his
mouth and pulled the trigger.

52:57.966 --> 52:59.047
I'm sorry.

53:04.932 --> 53:05.967
I didn't know.

53:11.021 --> 53:12.136
Why do you sleep with me?

53:13.774 --> 53:16.357
- Because I like you.
- What do you like about me?

53:18.904 --> 53:19.985
Your innocence.

53:21.115 --> 53:22.196
Were you ever innocent?

53:24.201 --> 53:25.191
I forgot.

53:25.703 --> 53:26.784
Come on? Tell me.

53:28.706 --> 53:30.367
I wanna know about when you were innocent.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.456
- Why?
- Because I like the idea of it.

53:33.544 --> 53:35.535
If you want someone so pure,
why are you with me?

53:36.130 --> 53:37.211
Because I care about you.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.334
You care about me?

53:46.056 --> 53:47.672
I don't care for anyone, remember?

53:50.769 --> 53:53.978
But the truth was,
she cared about them both.

53:55.315 --> 53:58.433
And that's when she knew,
this mess would only get worse.

53:59.486 --> 54:02.478
She had to make a clean break,
starting with Ethan.

54:03.991 --> 54:08.531
What she didn't anticipate was,
he'd surrendered too much of his past

54:08.996 --> 54:10.532
to give up on his future.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.207
You think he's in love with her?

54:23.469 --> 54:24.584
He just has to stop.

54:25.345 --> 54:26.506
You and your father...

54:27.347 --> 54:29.554
You suffer from the same disease.

54:30.225 --> 54:31.260
Johanna.

54:32.060 --> 54:35.143
Visions of Johanna.
Conquered my mind.

54:37.357 --> 54:38.438
Why are you writing about me?

54:42.029 --> 54:43.064
That's what I do.

54:43.530 --> 54:46.864
I write about people I know
and then give them a thin veil.

54:47.743 --> 54:48.778
Why me?

54:51.663 --> 54:52.653
Look, I...

54:53.874 --> 54:55.740
I got the apartment
to get out of the house

54:55.918 --> 54:57.955
and write a completely different story.

54:58.796 --> 55:01.083
- It didn't come across.
- Mine did.

55:02.716 --> 55:04.047
But like everything good,

55:04.468 --> 55:08.086
it happened by accident.
I met you, now I got 118 pages.

55:11.266 --> 55:14.258
My father's publishing house, they're
throwing an anniversary party tomorrow.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.219
You should come.

55:18.273 --> 55:19.388
No.

55:20.526 --> 55:22.437
You've heard all about these people
but you never met them.

55:24.071 --> 55:25.106
Good for the book.

55:28.283 --> 55:29.318
Find a window.

55:30.452 --> 55:31.442
Pounce.

55:32.371 --> 55:33.361
And pounce.

55:53.475 --> 55:54.590
I broke up with Nick.

55:57.354 --> 55:58.435
Did you?

56:04.194 --> 56:06.060
You are supposed
to be more excited than that.

56:48.906 --> 56:49.896
Hey.

56:50.824 --> 56:51.905
Thanks for coming.

56:53.410 --> 56:54.400
It's a great party.

56:54.536 --> 56:56.243
Yeah, always is.

56:57.331 --> 56:58.992
That's my mother, Mimi.

57:04.171 --> 57:05.252
She's beautiful.

57:06.798 --> 57:07.959
I told you she was.

57:08.550 --> 57:10.132
I was talking about your mother.

57:31.782 --> 57:33.398
It is amazing. But I can keep...

57:33.575 --> 57:35.612
Sorry. I want you to come meet somebody.

57:35.744 --> 57:38.111
Oh, who are we meeting?

57:38.288 --> 57:40.450
- Meeting my new friend.
- Your new friend?

57:40.749 --> 57:42.080
- Sorry, sorry.
- All right. I will be back.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.041
He was just here.

57:49.383 --> 57:50.589
He was?

57:50.926 --> 57:52.587
Well, maybe meet him later.

57:53.261 --> 57:54.342
There's Dan.

58:08.235 --> 58:11.944
"I look down upon the city
from high windows.

58:14.366 --> 58:16.607
It was then that the great buildings...

58:17.786 --> 58:21.825
lose reality and take on
their magical powers.

58:25.252 --> 58:30.668
Squares and squares of flame,
set and cut into the ether.

58:30.799 --> 58:32.210
Here's our poetry..."

58:33.969 --> 58:36.381
"For we have pulled down the stars
to our will."

58:37.347 --> 58:39.338
- "To our will..."
- Ezra Pound.

58:42.728 --> 58:44.139
Johanna, I'm assuming.

58:45.605 --> 58:46.766
We haven't met, have we?

58:47.024 --> 58:49.482
No, but I know you very well.

58:51.194 --> 58:54.061
And I know that you're having your fun.

58:55.365 --> 58:57.231
And that he's young and easy.

58:57.868 --> 59:00.701
But you'll have me
to deal with if he scars.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.082
I don't like strange conversations.

59:09.671 --> 59:10.832
So, I'm gonna walk away.

59:41.078 --> 59:42.284
I'll be back in a second.

59:54.508 --> 59:55.498
What?

59:56.384 --> 59:58.170
I really think
we should stop seeing each other.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:01.674
Thomas.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.927
- Why?
- Looks bad, now come on.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.805
I was ending it with your father as well.

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:12.352
And not because I didn't care for him,
I actually really do.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:13.728
I care for him very much but...

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.397
Now, Thomas, the thing is you...
he proposed.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:19.863
- What?
- And I said, "Yes."

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:25.736
- No, no, no, no, no...
- Please, I don't want us to be disruptive.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.788
- So, stop...
- Dad is not gonna leave her.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.623
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:32.501
No, this is the best thing for everybody.

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:34.168
- For who?
- For everybody.

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:35.829
Judith's going to be so much better off.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.333
She won't be suffering anymore
under the weight of a dead marriage.

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:41.176
He's going through a crisis...
he's just going through a fucking crisis.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.339
- That's all this is.
- Come on.

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:45.131
This doesn't have to be this difficult.
Please, everybody can win here.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.509
God made a mistake when
he made you beautiful.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.306
Well, God's mistake is
marrying your father.

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:51.553
Not yet, she isn't.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.056
Look, can I just ask you one thing?

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:56.934
If any of this comes out,
who do you think is gonna get hurt?

01:00:57.946 --> 01:00:59.107
It's not me.

01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:00.479
It's not Ethan.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.940
We both know how
to land on our feet and it's not you.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.400
You're so young.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.485
This one person...

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.080
One person will be destroyed
and we both know who that is.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.578
What do you think is gonna happen?

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:12.954
You think that you can get married,

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.705
you think you can have
the obligatory second family

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.292
and live happily ever after
in your dream world?

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:19.335
- You thin...
- Well, obviously that can't happen.

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.583
What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:26.255
What's that supposed to mean?
What is it supposed to mean?

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:28.424
Stop it.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:35.310
- Stop it, Thomas, come on.
- I'm gonna tell him everything.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:37.144
Thomas.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.614
Thomas?

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:34.288
Thomas, what are you doing?

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:36.992
It's raining.

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:45.087
Okay.

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:48.590
I...

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:50.430
I broke up with Nick...

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.722
Because I got into Croatia...

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:58.389
And I want you to come with me.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:10.867
I slept with Johanna.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.326
No.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.199
You're not like that.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.870
And I thought that I was in love with her.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:25.419
You're good?

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.138
No, Mimi, I'm not good.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:39.813
Mimi?

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:42.391
Mimi?

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.070
I'm sorry.

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:54.702
You're just like them.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:56.910
They won, Thomas.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.283
God, they fucking bankrupted you.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.828
- Hey.
- Thomas, did you spend last night here?

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.162
Yeah.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:27.501
Well, that, was the best party
that Kenta has thrown in years.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:30.507
Everybody was drunk
and not just our alcoholic friends

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:31.750
but everybody.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:33.756
Why did you spend the night?

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:37.005
I don't know. I just...

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.429
wanted to come home.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.139
Are you upset?

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:46.189
Tell me about it.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:50.522
What?

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.320
Is it about a girl?

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.191
And I am your mother, so?

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.823
Things have gotten messy and...

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:00.904
I wanna bail.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:04.992
But I can't.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:07.619
Then you know.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.590
The only way out...

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:14.546
is through.

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.216
Right?

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:20.969
Where's dad?

01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:22.759
He left early.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.183
He said he had to go to the office
and get some files.

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:28.982
He seems to have gotten over, what it...

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.286
Thomas?

01:06:57.972 --> 01:06:59.804
- Dad?
- Thomas.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.465
We need to talk.

01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:05.219
- There are somethings that you don't know.
- Thomas, don't.

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:07.061
- Don't.
- That you need to know.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:10.982
Johanna.

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:14.565
You two know each other?

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:15.857
Yeah.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.358
What?

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:21.072
Well Ethan the thing is, is that...

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:23.278
He followed me.

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:25.496
You followed her?

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:28.742
That's not all I did.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.376
I'm sorry, I...

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:39.506
I don't understand.

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:46.680
We slept together.

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:49.479
And not just once.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:52.603
What?

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:16.881
You slick little shit. You have...
I did right by you.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.759
You have no idea. You have no idea.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:53.622
I deserve you.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:26.613
I'm sorry.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.162
We're all sorry, Thomas.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.701
I really do love him.

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:45.049
And he did right by you.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.055
More than you know.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:56.932
Good bye, Thomas.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:13.011
Did you finish it?

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:18.266
I did.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:20.974
Tell me about it.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:27.442
Tell me about the only living boy
in New York.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.201
Aah, well...

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:44.631
It's about great people, artists.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.258
Great friends.

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:52.093
One of them is a beautiful...

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.595
young girl. The other two,

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:58.019
one artist has talent, the other doesn't.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:00.855
No, no matter how hard he tries,

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:03.516
no matter how badly he wants it,
he just...

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:08.905
- I wasn't kissed by God in that way.
- But he has the girl.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:12.742
Yes. And they're married.

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:16.034
And they plan to start a family.

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:19.950
Only, they have a little problem.

01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:21.117
He's infertile.

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:25.163
And he asked a talented friend for help.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.793
Yeah, you have a knack for a story,
Thomas.

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:33.137
I get it from my father.

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.150
So...

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:52.198
they're artists
and they don't want to use in vitro.

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.825
So, they go to
a cheap bottle of Cabernet...

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:59.326
Some Quaaludes and
Simon and Garfunkel record.

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:03.126
- The pair of them decide...
- And... and... the husband's okay with that?

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:06.084
Well, look...
they wanna use somebody that they know,

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:07.671
somebody that they love.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:15.093
And of course, the artist with the talent,
he's flattered,

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:17.344
and of course he agrees.

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.264
And he and...

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:24.268
the beautiful girl...

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:29.981
they...

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:36.071
they walk the city streets that night...
for hours.

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:37.819
They're both so damn nervous.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:42.582
And they end up at Washington Square Park,

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.703
where they dance...

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.795
to no music.

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:56.796
And the rest comes easy.

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:02.309
And does he love her?

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:04.763
He does.

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:09.192
In that moment he realizes he does...

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:18.610
And so it turns out that...

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:23.123
that the beautiful girl...

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:29.501
she gives birth to a wonderful son
and... her husband, gives up art,

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:32.461
becomes a very successful art dealer.

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:35.088
And the other artist?

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:43.055
He watches the boy grow from afar.
You know?

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:47.397
Sees his own talent alive in this child.

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.691
So desperately wants
to connect with his son.

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.358
And tell him everything.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.615
And future his talent, you know.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:17.135
But of course he never does make contact.

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:21.840
Until?

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.723
Until he decides
to make it all his next book.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:44.036
It's okay.

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:04.469
Mom?

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:13.978
Thomas.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.396
What did he tell you?

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.781
Everything.

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:25.028
You here looking for razors?

01:16:26.373 --> 01:16:27.363
Empty pill bottles?

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:31.746
Sit down.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.218
What do you know, Thomas?

01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:44.214
I know...

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.550
I know why you carry so much guilt.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:52.559
I know that I...

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:54.853
already forgive you.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.569
I know you are in love with someone you
haven't seen in over twenty-five years.

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.735
And you go to Riverside Park everyday
to read his books.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.075
I know. I know and it's okay.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.490
- Who told you?
- He did.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.374
Julian, W.F.

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:14.373
Whatever you wanna call him.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.501
Is he dying?

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:19.707
He's not dying.

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:21.588
- No?
- No, he's not dying.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.466
He's fine. He's just...

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.388
I don't know, he's tired.

01:17:27.017 --> 01:17:28.052
Think he's lonely.

01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:32.895
It was my idea not
to tell you, not Ethan's.

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:34.852
- You have to know that.
- Okay.

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:36.774
You were trying to protect me.

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:39.564
Yes and...

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.564
and I knew that if you found out,

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:46.989
he would come back into my life
and then everything would go to shit.

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:48.949
Well, everything went
to shit on its own, so...

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:53.658
Yeah, I guess.

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:06.045
Is he old?

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:10.386
He's messy.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:12.802
Yeah, he always was.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.059
An unmade bed of a man.

01:18:17.985 --> 01:18:19.350
An unmade bed of a man.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.187
I like that.

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:23.691
You should.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.025
Your father wrote it.

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:03.610
We're closed.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:07.986
I'm sorry, I thought I locked the door.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:16.699
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:19.247
I'll be quick.

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:22.205
- I know what book I want.
- Sure.

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.216
What did you think?

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:33.174
Serviceable?

01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:37.640
You lie to make me feel good.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.982
The character that
surprised me the most was the father.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:48.273
Which one?

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:51.992
The one who didn't run away.

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:00.167
Whatever happened to Mimi?

01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:01.540
She's still in Croatia.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:03.246
She got a fellowship.

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.668
I don't think she's coming back.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:09.794
Did you hear back from Viking?

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:11.546
Yeah, it was a pass.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:13.047
I'm sorry.

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:15.884
You want me to make a few phone calls?

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:19.182
No.

01:20:20.858 --> 01:20:22.223
I wanna start something new. I have...

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:23.808
I have an idea.

01:20:24.194 --> 01:20:25.275
Well, that's good.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.479
Are you still speaking to Johanna?

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:30.318
No.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.364
- You lying to me?
- Yeah.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:38.998
- How's your mother?
- She's good.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.495
She quit smoking.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.582
Started writing for ARTnews again.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:45.045
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:46.667
She has a date tonight.

01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:48.541
Good for her.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:51.753
Truly.
