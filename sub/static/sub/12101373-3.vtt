00:47.000 --> 00:49.250
-[officer] That's it. Let's go.
-[man grunts]

00:54.375 --> 00:55.416
[indistinct chatter]

00:55.500 --> 00:56.666
[Mantus] Ma'am.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.333
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to answer me.

01:00.208 --> 01:02.208
Ma'am, please pay attention.

01:02.291 --> 01:05.458
The more you withhold information,
the harder this gets for you.

01:05.541 --> 01:06.958
How long have you been here?

01:07.750 --> 01:08.583
Ma'am!

01:10.791 --> 01:12.750
Do the landlords know you're living here?

01:13.541 --> 01:15.541
-Tell us who else is helping you.
-[Ruth] Please.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.833
[Mantus] Are there any more
families in this area?

01:17.916 --> 01:18.916
Stop.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.083
[Mantus]
You realize what you're doing is illegal.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.958
We're not hurting anyone.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.333
We're just trying to live.

01:27.916 --> 01:28.833
[Pentle] Let's go!

01:28.916 --> 01:30.083
Let's go! Let's go!

01:31.375 --> 01:32.500
That's all of them.

01:33.208 --> 01:35.375
They were all inside
when we breached the door.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.958
Hell, I don't even think these kids
have ever seen outside.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.041
See this?

01:42.541 --> 01:44.750
They made a bassinet out of a drawer.

01:46.291 --> 01:47.375
Resourceful.

01:48.083 --> 01:50.541
-Did you get photos for the prosecutor?
-Got them.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.875
-[Briggs] Good.
-[Pentle] Mm-hm.

02:00.875 --> 02:02.833
All right then. Go ahead, take them in.

02:02.916 --> 02:04.750
-I'll deal with the kids.
-[Pentle] Got it.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.041
Come on, lady! Let's go!

02:06.125 --> 02:07.208
[Soran] Get up!

02:08.208 --> 02:09.958
-Move.
-[Ruth] Please, please.

02:10.041 --> 02:12.708
Sir, we're not doing anything wrong.

02:12.791 --> 02:15.125
-[Pentle] Out!
-We're just trying to live.

02:15.208 --> 02:17.000
They're just children.

02:17.083 --> 02:20.166
-[Soran] Quiet!
-Please! They haven't had breakfast!

02:21.166 --> 02:23.416
-[Soran] Open it up.
-[Ruth] They need to have breakfast!

[thunder rolling]

Sorry, kids.

[man over radio]
Possible 808 down city from Angel Tower.

02:52.666 --> 02:55.125
Mother and partner. Armed.

02:55.208 --> 02:58.041
Harboring at least two
unregistered offspring.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.500
730 east side of Mott at Canal.

03:00.583 --> 03:04.875
Gang of four, ages 8 to 10.
Situation resolved.

03:04.958 --> 03:06.500
Request disposal units.

03:09.875 --> 03:12.875
[opera music playing]

[vocalizing]

04:00.166 --> 04:02.625
[cheering]

04:04.541 --> 04:06.625
[Alice]
I thought you weren't gonna make it.

04:06.708 --> 04:08.041
I wouldn't miss this.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.291
Was it a bad one?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.916
-What, the call?
-Mm.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.333
Usual crazies.

04:14.083 --> 04:17.500
Just breeders, not armed or anything.
It was... easy.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.583
Well, I can't imagine stopping
the rejoo treatments just like that.

04:21.666 --> 04:24.375
I mean, why give all this up?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.208
I've just spent 20 years
perfecting that solo.

04:29.291 --> 04:31.416
And it was beautiful, Alice,
just beautiful.

04:32.166 --> 04:33.625
[Briggs chuckles]

04:33.708 --> 04:36.333
So not having kids
seems a small price to pay

04:36.875 --> 04:39.041
for getting to live forever.

04:39.125 --> 04:44.458
Well, we can't keep letting people
into this party if no one ever leaves.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.791
[Alice] That reminds me.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.125
I have my boost tomorrow.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.500
Can you take me?

04:55.541 --> 04:56.833
Yeah.

04:56.916 --> 04:59.333
Yeah, what the hell.
Pentle can cover for me.

04:59.958 --> 05:00.916
Great.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.791
You know,
if we weren't gonna live forever...

05:05.958 --> 05:07.083
I'd marry you.

05:07.708 --> 05:12.166
If we weren't gonna live forever,
I'd let you get me pregnant.

05:16.333 --> 05:19.333
Your face. Don't be so serious.

05:19.416 --> 05:22.250
There she is. Alice, darling,

05:22.333 --> 05:25.208
you simply must come with me.
No protesting.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.458
[crowd applauding]

05:26.541 --> 05:28.000
[Maria] Everyone, everyone.

05:29.125 --> 05:31.208
Here's to Alice.

05:31.875 --> 05:36.875
In the final moments, it was her execution
of Telogo's infamous solo

05:36.958 --> 05:41.500
that made our performance resonate
so strongly with the critics.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.166
For over a century,

05:44.250 --> 05:47.375
Banini's interpretation
of the work has been...

05:49.125 --> 05:52.916
I never thought anyone
would conquer that ancient dinosaur.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.125
[crowd laughing]

05:54.208 --> 05:58.250
So to commemorate the end of an era,
a small token...

05:58.333 --> 06:00.333
[crying]

06:01.041 --> 06:02.125
...for Alice!

06:03.833 --> 06:07.750
-Our slayer of dinosaurs.
-[crowd cheering and applauding]

06:13.208 --> 06:14.500
[Alice] Are you okay?

06:15.666 --> 06:16.500
Yeah.

06:17.666 --> 06:19.958
I just need a little rest is all.

06:22.875 --> 06:23.958
Hold my hand.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.458
[inhales deeply]

06:36.833 --> 06:39.166
[gasps then exhales]

06:40.416 --> 06:42.416
[dramatic music playing]

06:52.291 --> 06:54.583
[Alice] I feel so good.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.666
-Come on.
-What, right now?

06:57.750 --> 06:58.708
Oh, yes, right now.

06:58.791 --> 07:00.958
You know how I feel
after a rejoo treatment.

07:01.041 --> 07:02.583
Alice, just hang on.

07:02.666 --> 07:04.083
Just hang on.

07:05.541 --> 07:06.458
Hang on.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.125
[ominous music playing]

07:09.541 --> 07:10.791
Stop.

07:10.875 --> 07:11.791
Why?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.250
I'm sorry.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.791
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I just--

07:15.875 --> 07:17.791
I can't do this. Not right now.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.833
[Alice scoffs]

07:23.416 --> 07:24.708
Such a bore.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.916
[dramatic music playing]

07:30.708 --> 07:34.166
[Pentle] She couldn't stop it from crying.
Didn't know what to do with it.

07:34.250 --> 07:38.083
Didn't know how to make it calm down.
Well, that's when the neighbors heard.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.875
Thought it was a dog at first.

07:40.958 --> 07:43.083
What did these breeders
think would happen?

07:43.166 --> 07:44.833
The noise those things make.

07:44.916 --> 07:47.458
I don't know if going off rejoo
makes them stupid...

07:47.541 --> 07:49.791
-[Soran] Come on.
-...or if they're just born that way.

07:49.875 --> 07:52.041
You child killer.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.958
-Murderer.
-[Soran] Hey, that's it.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.125
Coward!

07:57.000 --> 07:59.583
-[Mantus] He's got my gun!
-You fucking monster!

08:02.458 --> 08:03.291
[Mantus] We got him.

08:03.375 --> 08:06.708
[Pentle] You okay, Briggs?
That guy nearly blew a hole in you.

08:06.791 --> 08:08.708
[Soran] Weapon secured. Weapon secured.

08:08.791 --> 08:09.625

Oh, yes, this is a fine, fine piece.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.875
You'd never guess
it was over 200 years old.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.375
[coins clattering]

09:30.416 --> 09:32.208
Bet you sell a lot of those.

09:32.291 --> 09:35.625
Mm. Not many. Not now.

09:36.291 --> 09:38.750
Not many collectors around
for that sort of thing.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.833
Not anymore.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.708
Yeah. Of course.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.791
Did you want to look
at the rest of the dinosaur stock?

09:46.875 --> 09:48.541
No. Not a collector.

It's okay. Sit.

10:49.583 --> 10:53.416
Please, sit.
I just want to ask you some questions.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.083
-Smoke?
-No.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.041
Ah, right.

11:19.916 --> 11:21.208
Bad for the, uh...

11:28.666 --> 11:29.750
Why do you do it?

11:32.416 --> 11:34.708
Why do people like you
keep having these kids?

11:34.791 --> 11:35.958
Why?

11:38.291 --> 11:43.041
Because I'm not so in love with myself
that I just want to live forever and ever.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.291
And this is living?

11:45.666 --> 11:46.541
Here?

11:47.833 --> 11:49.333
-Keeping it locked up--
-Her.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.875
Her name... is Melanie.

-Okay.

[dramatic music playing]

12:10.333 --> 12:11.833
You're smiling.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.166
She's cute.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.583
You feel something, don't you?

12:18.375 --> 12:21.000
You've got to know
this can't possibly work.

12:23.291 --> 12:26.583
I've been alive 218 years.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.666
I've seen... too much.

12:31.416 --> 12:33.625
But she makes everything new.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.958
I love seeing things
through her little eyes.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.208

12:38.291 --> 12:41.083
They're so bright.
They're so full of life.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.666
Not dead.

12:44.291 --> 12:45.666
Like yours.

12:53.958 --> 12:55.958
I remember her first steps.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.791
I remember her first laugh.

13:00.208 --> 13:02.875
I remember the first time
she called me Mommy.

13:04.625 --> 13:08.458
I remember all these moments
because I know I won't have many.

No, please. Please, she's just a child.

13:59.833 --> 14:03.583
Please don't, she's just a child.
Please. Don't shoot her.

14:03.666 --> 14:05.750
Take me. Shoot me instead.

14:05.833 --> 14:08.833
I'll make room. Do it. Do it!

Kill me instead. I'll make room.
