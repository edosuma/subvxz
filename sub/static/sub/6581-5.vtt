WEBVTT

00:05.173 --> 00:05.473
( grunting )

00:16.650 --> 00:17.685
Now you go.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.364
Get up.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.400
Sunny, I can't.
I'm too tired.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.735
You're not tired,
you're afraid.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.204
We go again.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.581
( whimpering )

00:47.615 --> 00:50.251
Sunny, stop.
I'm warning you.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.553
Or what?
You're gonna
kill me?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.655
Just like you
killed those people
on that boat?

00:58.659 --> 01:00.528
Do you know
how to get to Azra
or not?

01:00.561 --> 01:03.364
No, I don't.
But between my book
and your compass,

01:03.397 --> 01:05.699
we can figure it out.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.735
What happens to you
when you can't control
your power?

01:07.768 --> 01:10.504
I can.
You saw it
at the parley.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.073
How do I know
you weren't lucky?

01:16.144 --> 01:17.545
You don't.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.714
Ahhh!

01:20.748 --> 01:22.250
( gasps )

01:24.485 --> 01:26.720
( breathing heavily )

02:26.447 --> 02:27.915
Veil:
Sunny.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.187
Is everything okay?

02:34.288 --> 02:35.589
What's that?

02:36.690 --> 02:39.159
Nothing.
It's broken.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.598
Sorry for waking you.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.203
It wasn't you.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.638
It's being pregnant.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.610
You know I won't be able
to hide it much longer.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.348
I think I've found
a way out.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.753
There's a boat
going upriver.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.521
But the price
is steep.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.525
How steep?

03:53.000 --> 03:53.301
( grunting )

04:01.542 --> 04:03.377
I've been practicing
since sunup.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.945
I thought I'd get
the boring stuff
out of the way

04:04.978 --> 04:06.547
so we could get
to fighting.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.017
What's going on?

04:10.050 --> 04:11.852
Are you still mad
about the parley?

04:11.885 --> 04:14.021
I told you, Sunny,
I was cut by accident.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.958
You know
you could've killed
that Butterfly,

04:17.991 --> 04:19.026
but you didn't.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.028
Really?

04:21.061 --> 04:23.564
What did I do?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.899
You let her go.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.901
It looked like
you were controlling
your power.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.806
I don't know
what happened.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.443
- So you got lucky?
- Maybe.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.512
Does this mean
we get to leave soon?

04:38.546 --> 04:41.515
Quinn wants us
to find the Widow.

04:41.549 --> 04:42.883
We leave in an hour.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.667
Quinn
and the other barons,

04:59.700 --> 05:02.536
they want you to believe
they're benevolent

05:02.570 --> 05:05.839
because they protect you
from the horrors of the world.

05:05.873 --> 05:09.410
I offer you
a brighter future,

05:09.443 --> 05:11.445
a real future,

05:11.479 --> 05:12.913
one you can control.

05:14.948 --> 05:18.051
The other barons,
they won't go quickly
or quietly.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.920
If you're not up
for the fight,

05:19.953 --> 05:22.756
you may leave now
without punishment
or consequence.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.961
Here in this sanctuary,
you have your freedom.

05:27.995 --> 05:32.466
All I ask in return
is your unwavering loyalty.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.734
What's your name?

05:33.767 --> 05:35.035
Jolyon.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.570
Welcome, Jolyon.

05:36.604 --> 05:37.971
The other boys
are already inside.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.607
Tilda will show you
the way.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.613
Quinn:
The Widow struck at the height
of the poppy harvest.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.882
Without our cogs,
half the crop will rot

05:48.916 --> 05:50.718
and the other
not far behind.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.821
Then inform the barons
that the opium shipments
will be reduced.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.490
And what happens
the next time that
the Widow or another baron

05:56.524 --> 05:58.992
feels our cogs
are ripe for the taking?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.995
Fortify
the Clipper force.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.831
She took advantage
because she knows

06:03.864 --> 06:07.000
you're stretched
over two territories.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.103
Maybe if we
treated the cogs
with respect,

06:10.137 --> 06:14.074
gave them
a basic education,

06:14.107 --> 06:15.743
that would buy you
more loyalty

06:15.776 --> 06:17.177
than a hundred pieces
of the Widow's gold.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.947
We already give
those people everything.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.150
Quinn, do you remember
when you were a boy?

06:23.183 --> 06:25.453
Blistering your hands
in those fields?

06:25.486 --> 06:27.655
Did you see your baron
as a kindly father?

06:27.688 --> 06:29.823
No, you hated him
and your own situation.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.559
It's just human nature.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.827
Yeah, I pulled myself up
through blood and toil.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.529
No one helped me.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.064
Now you want me
to educate the weak

06:37.097 --> 06:38.966
so they can plan
their revolution.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.634
Jade:
It's already happening.

06:40.668 --> 06:43.003
Like it or not, the Widow
is stirring that pot.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.005
Oh, you sound
like you admire her.

06:50.844 --> 06:54.748
We sit here
with the largest Clipper force
and two territories

06:54.782 --> 06:56.784
talking about a woman
who's done more damage

06:56.817 --> 06:58.118
with no army at all.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.020
None of this solves
our immediate problem.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.223
I worked the harvest
when I was a child.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.992
Give me part
of your Clipper force.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.627
I'll show them
how it's done.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.930
It will be a bridge
until the new cogs arrive.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.770
I'll gather the men
for your instruction.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.054
M.K., right?

07:38.058 --> 07:40.260
Where are you headed?

07:40.293 --> 07:43.597
Sunny's taking a crew
to track down the Widow.

07:43.631 --> 07:46.800
She was looking for you
at one point, wasn't she?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.805
Well, I wish you luck.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.843
Could you give me
my pendant back?

08:02.049 --> 08:04.818
You mean the one
you tried to steal
from my room?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.987
It was stolen
from me first.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.222
Wish I could
help you out.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.158
It's gone.
I traded it.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.196
Why is it
so important to you?

08:16.229 --> 08:18.098
My mother
gave it to me.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.534
Beautiful craftsmanship.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.803
What was the design?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.104
Don't know.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.142
You're a bad liar.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.279
- ( door opens )
- Sunny: M.K.?

08:33.947 --> 08:35.248
Time to head out.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.294
( engine starts )

09:01.942 --> 09:04.144
Quinn:
You all have
sworn an oath

09:04.177 --> 09:06.947
to protect our home.

09:06.980 --> 09:11.819
Today, the fort
does not require
your skills with a sword.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.021
It needs your hands.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.026
Our poppy crop
will spoil

09:19.059 --> 09:21.729
if it is not harvested
immediately.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.164
We can't
let this happen.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.836
Now it needs-- oh.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.871
( Quinn groans )

09:38.746 --> 09:41.682
Now it needs you
to pull togeth--

09:41.715 --> 09:44.084
( groaning )

09:49.022 --> 09:50.057
Lead them.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.669
Your baron will be fine.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.238
We have work to do.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.714
- Okay.
- ( groans )

10:13.747 --> 10:15.649
Fetch Veil.
Hurry!

10:19.853 --> 10:21.154
- Oh.
- Come on.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.356
Come on.
Come on.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.998
( birds chirping )

10:34.401 --> 10:36.436
You're worried
about her--

10:36.469 --> 10:39.206
Veil, I mean,
aren't you?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.074
What makes you
say that?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.810
Because I know.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.077
Know what?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.846
You know,
that she's pregnant.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.919
Makes sense why
you wanna leave now.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.757
- Have you told anyone?
- Of course not.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.930
It must be
strange for you

11:02.963 --> 11:06.099
to have to care for someone
and not kill them.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.402
I'm sure there's times
you've thought about
killing me.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.872
It's crossed my mind.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.075
Well, if it's worth anything,
you're not a shitty teacher.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.744
You've given me hope
that I might be able

11:16.777 --> 11:18.746
to control what happens
when I'm cut.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.484
Why did you lie to me
about Azra?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.054
I didn't.
I know the way,

11:27.087 --> 11:29.222
but it's all jumbled
in my head.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.024
That's why I thought
the Widow's book
would help.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.830
I got my compass to work.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.832
I put it in the cutout
of that book.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.068
What happened?
Did it point somewhere?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.504
I might have
a direction.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.906
Maybe.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.177
See, I told you
I could help.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.826
Off you go.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.302
That was the last one.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.940
Are you sure the boy
you're looking for is
one of Quinn's cogs?

12:19.973 --> 12:22.409
He was in the fort.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.211
Perhaps he's a Colt now.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.383
Mother,
when you find him,

12:30.417 --> 12:33.253
how exactly do you
plan to use him?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.222
You said
he was dangerous.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.425
I was just curious
if he was dangerous
to everyone.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.128
I need to train him,
teach him control,

12:41.161 --> 12:43.263
which is that more difficult
without that book.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.265
Does it have
the answers?

12:45.298 --> 12:48.301
Why the sudden burst
of curiosity?

12:48.335 --> 12:51.504
Because I want to be
more help to you...

12:51.538 --> 12:53.440
now that Angelica
and Valentine are gone.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.178
I was still
translating the book.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.547
I believe
the answers I seek
are within its pages.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.219
Will the boy change?

13:06.253 --> 13:08.889
You know, be different
after he's trained?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.958
Right now
every time he's cut,

13:10.991 --> 13:13.360
his life force
gets weaker.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.895
Without training,
he will die.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.132
What about that boy
you brought home?

13:19.166 --> 13:22.903
M.K.? I cut him.
You watched me.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.972
I also saw you
kissing him.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.943
He was kind to me once.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.979
Remember that kindness
is a weapon men use

13:32.012 --> 13:33.446
to get what they want.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.348
Yes, Mother.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.484
Quinn won't take
the theft of his cogs
lying down.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.253
Take three of your sisters
and check the traps.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.827
( pigeons cooing )

13:50.263 --> 13:53.433
For somebody
with just two toes
on your left foot,

13:53.466 --> 13:56.136
you got a steady gait.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.505
I never understood
how you could do that.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.373
( door squeaks )

14:00.407 --> 14:02.442
Know who it is
without turning around.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.377
Well...

14:06.213 --> 14:08.548
you lose one ability,

14:08.581 --> 14:11.351
I guess you
just develop another.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.154
You can still do it
when you walked.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.957
Well, maybe I'm just
that damn good.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.993
So how are you feeling?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.029
Heard all about
your head.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.464
I'm finally
seeing things clearer.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.302
Realizing who
I can count on...

14:29.336 --> 14:30.570
who I can't.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.676
Since you've
come to see me,

14:36.709 --> 14:40.447
am I to assume
that I am still
among the chosen few?

14:41.681 --> 14:44.384
Oh, you rescued me,
Waldo.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.253
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be dead.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.221
Oh, no,
that took some steel

14:48.255 --> 14:51.058
to survive
the hell you endured.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.194
But you didn't
come here

14:54.227 --> 14:56.964
to reminisce about
the bad ol' days.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.403
I wanted to know
that if things changed
around here...

15:08.275 --> 15:10.143
I'd have your support.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.179
Mm...

15:12.212 --> 15:14.047
sounds ominous.

15:14.081 --> 15:18.151
I know my father
cast you aside when
you were injured.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.687
I also know
you and Sunny
are very close.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.291
Ryder...

15:26.459 --> 15:28.328
I'm on the side
that wins.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.665
A man in my position,

15:32.699 --> 15:35.969
which is to say
permanently seated,

15:36.003 --> 15:37.670
well...

15:37.704 --> 15:40.974
options get limited.

15:41.008 --> 15:45.045
However, I would
advise you to choose
your allies with care.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.550
Anything else
you wanna talk about?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.257
I took it
off Sunny's Colt.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.459
My mother knows
something about it.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.170
And you
wanna know more?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.706
Well...

16:13.740 --> 16:15.642
I think you should
go talk to the man

16:15.675 --> 16:19.346
who taught Lydia
everything she knows.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.181
Go talk
to your grandfather,

16:21.214 --> 16:23.383
the preacher,
Penrith.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.385
She hasn't spoken
to him in years.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.121
I'm talking
about you here.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.057
I think you should
go get acquainted.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.433
Bale:
I hope we find
some Butterflies.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.402
I want
my first kill tat.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.803
What's the rush?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.139
You've only been a Colt
a couple of weeks.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.777
You already
killed someone
for the regent.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.413
Saved his life.
You're set.

16:53.446 --> 16:57.484
Me, I gotta
prove myself
to Petri.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.220
If that means
killing some girls,
then...

17:00.253 --> 17:01.521
so be it.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.425
M.K.:
Sunny, look.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.100
( grunts )

17:38.691 --> 17:40.793
( traps snapping )

17:42.529 --> 17:45.332
( snapping continues )

17:51.838 --> 17:54.174
- ( trap snaps )
- ( man groans )

18:07.420 --> 18:09.256
( groans )

18:09.289 --> 18:11.758
( groaning continues )

18:19.166 --> 18:22.202
Jade:
The poppy bulb
is very fragile.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.770
You need to milk it.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.639
And the trick is doing that
without killing the bulb.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.375
I know your instinct
is to cut deep,

18:28.408 --> 18:32.312
but in this case,
just through the top
layer of skin

18:32.345 --> 18:35.615
one... even... stroke.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.320
Let's get to work.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.166
I'm here to help.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.372
I appreciate that,
but you don't need
to get your hands dirty.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.608
Oh, Veil is looking
after Quinn.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.779
I can't rattle around
that empty house
doing nothing.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.281
Please, show me.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.798
Are you certain
you want to go through
with this, Baron?

19:25.832 --> 19:28.368
What happened
in front of my men

19:28.401 --> 19:30.337
will never happen again.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.473
( groaning )

19:35.575 --> 19:38.578
I'm sure
you're enjoying this.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.781
Watching me suffer
must give you great
pleasure.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.352
I'm not playing
this game with you.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.254
What game?

19:47.287 --> 19:49.322
The one where you
try and find enemies
where they don't exist.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.391
Oh, is that
what you think
I do?

19:53.693 --> 19:56.696
Your resting state
is war.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.566
It's your nature.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.868
I'm not sure
if it infuriates
or delights you

20:01.901 --> 20:03.936
that you're now
fighting your own body.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.506
I think I know
what infuriates you, Veil.

20:10.009 --> 20:14.847
Go on, ask me the question
you've been dying to ask.

20:16.483 --> 20:19.252
I know Sunny told you
what happened.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.987
How could he not?

20:22.455 --> 20:23.556
Why?

20:26.058 --> 20:28.395
Why did you kill
my parents?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.932
You know they would
never have told a soul
about your condition.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.437
Well, like you said,
it's in my nature.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.644
You could turn on
that poison.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.315
End me now.
No one would know.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.431
I guess we're both
prisoners of our natures.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.502
The truth is...

21:12.439 --> 21:13.840
I didn't kill
your parents.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.477
You're lying.

21:18.745 --> 21:22.048
Ask Sunny.
He was there.

21:22.081 --> 21:25.618
It was his blade
that ended their lives...

21:27.754 --> 21:29.556
not mine.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.868
Sunny:
You're lucky you didn't
lose your foot.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.403
Bite on this.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.614
- ( bone snaps )
- ( groans )

21:54.647 --> 21:57.484
You're no good
on this leg.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.685
We're staying here
tonight.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.454
M.K., you're
on first watch.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.991
Don't let the fire
go out.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.669
- ( frogs croaking )
- ( horse whinnies )

22:35.688 --> 22:37.156
Penrith:
The last time I saw you

22:37.189 --> 22:40.793
your mother
carried you in here
like a broken bird.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.829
I don't really have
any memory of that time.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.531
Perhaps for the best,

22:44.564 --> 22:47.734
considering what
those nomads did to you.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.135
I told your mother
what would happen

22:49.168 --> 22:51.504
if she married
a man like Quinn.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.641
Willing to sacrifice
his own son

22:54.674 --> 22:57.043
over his pride.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.978
He should've paid
the ransom.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.982
I'm not here to talk
about the past.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.686
Ever seen something
like this before?

23:13.125 --> 23:14.461
Where'd you get it?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.597
A boy in the fort.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.868
Azra.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.803
That name mean
anything to you?

23:25.605 --> 23:27.740
No.
What is it?

23:27.774 --> 23:31.177
A story
they used to tell
cog orphans.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.912
Make them believe
that they were from

23:32.945 --> 23:35.848
some faraway place
beyond the Badlands.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.820
Paradise.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.989
If it's just a story,

23:43.022 --> 23:45.157
then where'd
the pendant come from?

23:45.191 --> 23:47.660
Who knows?
Perhaps it was a maker

23:47.694 --> 23:49.829
in the outlying
territories.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.164
He could've forged it
from a picture he saw

23:52.198 --> 23:54.467
from the old world.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.106
It's human nature
to want to believe

24:00.139 --> 24:01.908
in something greater
than yourself.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.744
Your father
and the other barons

24:04.777 --> 24:07.213
certainly have exploited
that for their own power.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.081
And what do you do?

24:10.883 --> 24:13.686
Have people
worship totems.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.188
Smash them
to answer their prayers.

24:16.222 --> 24:19.659
Totems, part of
our ritual, yes,

24:19.692 --> 24:22.194
but I preach salvation
through acceptance...

24:23.696 --> 24:25.231
not fairy tales.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.669
To my mother,

24:29.702 --> 24:31.871
it seemed like
more than just a story.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.006
She's no longer
my daughter anymore--

24:34.040 --> 24:36.609
She still practices.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.244
I've seen the totems
in her room.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.617
Your mother
was never happy here.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.819
I didn't recognize it
until it was too late.

24:48.855 --> 24:52.925
Then one day
a Clipper rode in
hunting for nomads.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.928
She took one look
at your father

24:55.962 --> 24:58.097
and that's the moment
I lost her.

25:05.071 --> 25:08.240
I'm always here
if you wish to embark
on a different course.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.220
I prefer to make
my own salvation.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.664
Send word to the abbots
we've got a dark one
in the fort.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.600
He'll need to be cleansed.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.613
( rustling )

25:52.619 --> 25:53.820
Tilda:
You're not safe here.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.321
You almost got me
killed in the cemetery

25:55.354 --> 25:57.056
and now you're
trying to warn me?

25:57.089 --> 25:59.358
Just listen.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.728
My mother suspects you.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.830
- Did you tell her
what you saw?
- No.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.602
What did I see, M.K.?

26:09.636 --> 26:11.037
I don't even know.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.273
It's like I'm lost
inside myself.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.745
Sunny told me
I didn't hurt you.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.814
I thought
you were going to,
but...

26:21.848 --> 26:25.117
but then you
just stared at me.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.654
And for a moment,
I saw you, M.K.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.723
And then you
weren't lost.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.095
- What?
- Sunny told me

26:36.128 --> 26:37.997
that when I'm
in that state,

26:38.030 --> 26:42.034
I need to concentrate
on something that makes me
feel safe.

26:42.068 --> 26:46.372
I thought for sure
it'd be my mom,
but it's not.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.641
It's you.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.845
You're the reason
I was able to control it.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.219
My mother says
the more that power
is used,

27:00.252 --> 27:02.254
the weaker you get.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.891
Use it too much
and-- and you'll die.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.326
- How does she know that?
- From that black book.

27:07.359 --> 27:10.763
M.K., you need to get
as far away from here
as possible.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.165
All of these people
want to use you--

27:13.199 --> 27:15.668
my mother, Quinn,
even Sunny.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.805
We could
run away together.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.208
( twig snaps )

27:26.112 --> 27:27.446
( gasps )

27:38.190 --> 27:38.891
How long has this
been going on?

27:44.964 --> 27:46.866
You don't understand.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.300
She was trying to warn me
about the Widow.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.936
You know, every time
I begin to trust--

27:49.969 --> 27:51.904
Sunny.

27:51.938 --> 27:55.107
She's the reason
I was able to control
myself at the parley.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.347
Are you gonna tell me
where the Widow is

28:01.380 --> 28:03.115
or am I gonna
have to take you
back to the fort

28:03.149 --> 28:05.151
and have Quinn
force it out of you
himself?

28:06.886 --> 28:08.454
What's it gonna be?

28:08.487 --> 28:10.056
( crying )

28:10.089 --> 28:13.960
You heard the regent.
Speak up!

28:13.993 --> 28:15.427
( Tilda continues crying )

28:15.461 --> 28:18.130
Where is she, huh?

28:18.164 --> 28:19.732
Where is she?

28:21.467 --> 28:23.402
Where is she,
you little bitch?

28:25.204 --> 28:26.372
( screaming )

28:31.177 --> 28:32.711
Ah!

28:36.115 --> 28:37.316
( spits )

28:43.489 --> 28:44.957
Back to the fort it is.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.865
- ( Lydia winces )
- Jade: Sorry.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.368
I remember
my first harvest.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.137
My hands were
so blistered,

28:58.170 --> 29:01.540
I thought they were
going to fall off.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.176
I have a whole new respect
for these people.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.781
For a woman
who's never worked
a day in her life,

29:08.815 --> 29:10.449
you did well.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.923
I know you and I
haven't always seen
eye to eye.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.925
Well, how could we?

29:18.958 --> 29:21.794
Quinn has pitted us
against each other.

29:25.431 --> 29:29.135
It's hard...

29:29.168 --> 29:31.938
when you
build your life
with someone

29:31.971 --> 29:35.074
and then one day they decide
you're not enough anymore.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.146
- Quinn loves you.
- I know.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.115
But he doesn't need me
the way he needs you.

29:43.149 --> 29:47.153
And when he wants you
that way, it is...

29:47.186 --> 29:49.121
the best feeling
in the world.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.128
How do we do this?

29:57.229 --> 29:59.165
I'm not sure.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.102
But I don't wanna
do it as rivals.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.572
Neither do I.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.916
Mother.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.250
Over here.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.935
Head back to the sanctuary.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.938
Send word to our friend
in the fort.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.607
I need to gain entry.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.343
Mother, are you sure?

30:44.376 --> 30:47.079
Tilda would die
before she would talk.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.916
Of that
I have no doubt.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.250
Now, go.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.452
How long you been
sitting there, woman?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.621
Long enough.

31:29.655 --> 31:32.491
- What happened?
- ( chuckles )

31:32.524 --> 31:36.028
Scoring poppy bulbs
is harder than it looks.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.663
( chuckles )

31:37.696 --> 31:40.199
You're not dying on me,
you know that?

31:40.232 --> 31:42.601
I'm not going anywhere.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.172
Mm.

31:46.205 --> 31:49.408
I still remember
the first moment
I laid eyes on you.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.011
You were riding
through the woods,

31:52.044 --> 31:54.313
your blade wet
from battle.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.251
I don't think I ever
wanted someone so badly.

32:05.357 --> 32:09.095
It's always gonna be
me and you, Quinn.

32:09.128 --> 32:13.232
I will be by your side
when the wolves
reach our door,

32:13.265 --> 32:15.267
howling for your blood.

32:15.301 --> 32:18.170
( footsteps approach )

32:18.204 --> 32:19.405
Sunny.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.126
We've caught one
of her Butterflies.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.995
Finally... progress.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.764
I want you to talk to her

32:45.797 --> 32:48.300
until she spits out
the Widow's location.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.637
What's the matter,
Sunny?

32:51.670 --> 32:53.372
You getting
squeamish again?

32:53.405 --> 32:56.708
You do what
you have to do.
Are we clear?

32:56.742 --> 32:58.410
Yes, Baron.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.580
I'd hate for us
to have another
miscommunication.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.985
You and Veil...

33:09.188 --> 33:10.522
is that serious?

33:14.193 --> 33:17.396
No more serious than the girl
I wicked before her

33:17.429 --> 33:19.298
and the one before that.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.033
Good.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.202
I don't want you
to see her anymore.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.738
Since she's treating me,

33:26.772 --> 33:30.042
I'd just feel better
if everyone was less...

33:30.076 --> 33:31.610
entangled.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.747
As you wish, Baron.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.463
She's gonna get exactly
what she deserves.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.665
Shut up.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.467
What's your problem?

33:55.501 --> 33:57.469
You know
she would kill
any one of us.

33:59.471 --> 34:00.506
What?

34:00.539 --> 34:03.809
I told you
to shut up!

34:08.614 --> 34:10.782
What are you
gonna do with her?

34:13.185 --> 34:14.853
Sunny, don't.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.756
Stay put, both of you.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.413
Give me a reason
not to do this.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.553
( whimpers )

35:04.603 --> 35:08.574
( door opens, closes )

35:13.212 --> 35:15.781
I'm sick,
not an invalid.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.617
Veil thought
it would be easier
on your stomach.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.387
At least until we know
how the medicine
affects you.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.864
Why, the kitchen
make that?

35:32.898 --> 35:35.367
I did.

35:35.401 --> 35:38.404
Save the harvest,
make the supper, hmm?

35:38.437 --> 35:39.538
Is there anything
you can't do?

35:42.274 --> 35:45.944
You know, the first time
you brought me soup,
you were 16.

35:45.977 --> 35:49.215
Nostromo, my horse
had thrown me.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.950
That old brute was spooked
by a copperhead.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.620
The doc had me
laid up for a week.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.422
The highlight
of my afternoons

35:56.455 --> 35:57.789
was seeing you
walk through that door

35:57.823 --> 35:59.525
with a sweet smile
and a bowl of soup.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.859
( chuckles )

36:02.961 --> 36:05.631
That's when
I first noticed
you had blossomed

36:05.664 --> 36:08.467
into a beautiful
young woman.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.708
It's been a long day.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.944
I'm gonna turn in.

36:18.977 --> 36:21.547
Back in the fields
tomorrow.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.815
I understand
Lydia pitched in.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.418
She stayed until sunset.

36:26.452 --> 36:27.953
Has a real knack for it.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.391
Can't believe
you two worked together.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.634
( breathing rapidly )

36:42.668 --> 36:44.303
Jade?

36:47.673 --> 36:50.742
( gurgling )

36:50.776 --> 36:52.378
Help!

36:52.411 --> 36:53.945
Help me!

37:09.795 --> 37:12.364
M.K.:
Tilda.

37:12.398 --> 37:15.567
Tilda, tell him
where the Widow is
right now.

37:15.601 --> 37:16.902
This can
all be over.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.570
No, it won't.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.274
We both know Quinn
will kill me anyway.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.511
No.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.646
There's only one way
she's gonna talk.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.381
( grunts )

37:29.415 --> 37:31.883
Don't worry, Tilda.
Mother's here.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.657
You're not
getting away
this time.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.025
Watch me.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.744
( grunts )

38:15.427 --> 38:17.796
( grunting )

38:20.999 --> 38:22.334
( grunts )

38:58.970 --> 39:00.772
- ( roars )
- ( grunts )

39:21.893 --> 39:22.994
Come here.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.756
( grunts )

40:00.098 --> 40:01.700
( yells )

40:03.769 --> 40:05.937
( M.K. grunting )
No!

40:08.139 --> 40:09.808
( grunting )

40:11.510 --> 40:12.444
No!

40:15.614 --> 40:17.148
( grunting )

40:19.150 --> 40:20.118
( M.K. shouts )

40:20.151 --> 40:21.052
Tilda!

40:24.923 --> 40:27.593
Ah!
( groaning )

40:29.961 --> 40:32.063
( grunting )

40:32.097 --> 40:33.932
( grunting continues )

40:37.569 --> 40:39.605
- ( Bale continues grunting )
- ( kicks thudding )

40:51.517 --> 40:53.218
( grunting )

41:31.156 --> 41:32.991
( groaning )

41:39.831 --> 41:41.499
( M.K.'s body thuds )

42:21.206 --> 42:24.943
( music playing )
