08:19.416 --> 08:21.084
Lying there...

08:22.294 --> 08:24.630
staring down the barrel of that nine...

08:25.964 --> 08:27.925
l knew l was about to die.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.721
l don't know why l was
expecting my father to rescue me.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.224
l realized l had been looking for him
all my life.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.558
Marcus!

08:40.645 --> 08:42.231
This is my search.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.152
That's my mom.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.905
Those were the days.

08:49.988 --> 08:53.867
Things you do
That keeps me satisfied

08:57.287 --> 09:00.541
Problem was,
everyone was in love with my mom...

09:01.416 --> 09:03.377
so anyone could be my dad.

09:04.086 --> 09:07.548
One thing l was certain of,
l didn't have a white daddy.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.969
And sure as hell, he wasn't a cop...

09:13.637 --> 09:15.138
black or white.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.271
Spent a lot of time
at my grandmother's.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.357
That was a crowded house
with eight mouths to feed...

09:25.482 --> 09:26.608
not including me.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.069
Anybody know
how these things work, huh?

09:31.822 --> 09:33.782
Hey, Marcus.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.492

-Yeah, footbaII.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.248
There you go.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.376
Boy's a genius, huh?

09:44.877 --> 09:47.087
Can you watch him for an hour?

09:47.963 --> 09:50.340
Katrina, you know I'II watch him.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.467
Thank you.

09:54.178 --> 09:55.554
-I don't want that money.
-Come on, Mom.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.473
Katrina, I said I don't need that money.
He's famiIy.

09:58.557 --> 10:01.435

Ieaving him Iike this, Katrina?

10:06.565 --> 10:07.566

10:07.691 --> 10:09.234

That's my Uncle Deuce.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.572
-You Iook after him, okay?
-Pay you back.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.074
He was the oldest and the meanest.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.160
What's going on, homie?

10:19.244 --> 10:20.495
You okay?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.207
It's Saturday.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.251
Mama's gotta work

10:26.835 --> 10:28.045

11:03.121 --> 11:04.331

11:07.918 --> 11:10.546
Hey, right here. I'm open!

11:11.338 --> 11:13.382
l knew my mom sold drugs...

11:13.507 --> 11:16.635
but it didn't mean nothing to me
but good sneakers and school clothes.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.761
Yes!

11:18.929 --> 11:21.390
She always made sure

13:57.838 --> 14:00.090
Why did you get out of the car?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.761

14:17.900 --> 14:19.234
Baby boy...

You see evertyhing.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.222

14:48.555 --> 14:50.182
Mom, that's private.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.934
First we get to talking

14:52.017 --> 14:53.310
Then we get to touching

14:53.435 --> 14:53.769
When we get past the phone games
We'll be humping

14:53.769 --> 14:56.063
When we get past the phone games
We'll be humping

14:56.146 --> 14:58.607

Put my tongue in your ear

14:58.690 --> 15:01.276
Do it like the dogs do it, girl

15:01.360 --> 15:03.946
For me different scenery

15:04.071 --> 15:06.782

15:11.995 --> 15:13.539
Young Caesar busting through

15:16.166 --> 15:18.919
-Where did you get this?
-Marcus.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.754
I hate you.

-See you Iater.
-Okay.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.930

15:31.014 --> 15:34.476
Charlene's stepdad sent her away
to live with her grandparents.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.901
My mom was supposed to
come pick me up that night.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.991
But she never arrived.

15:54.163 --> 15:58.208
Neighbors said they heard
voices raised in a jealous rage.

16:00.794 --> 16:04.590
Soon after that,
the dogs were heard barking.

16:07.426 --> 16:09.011
And after that...

16:09.845 --> 16:12.097
flames were seen
coming from the window.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.843
CIass, move right in. Move right in.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.387
Hey, Mr. Matthews,

16:55.974 --> 16:59.353
''I wiII fear no eviI, for thou art with me...

16:59.686 --> 17:02.814
''thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.234
''Thou preparest a tabIe before me
in the presence of mine....''

17:06.318 --> 17:08.904
l was wondering whether
my father would show up to the funeral.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.949
''...my head with oiI,
my cup runneth over.''

17:12.074 --> 17:13.242
Maybe even her killer.

17:13.367 --> 17:16.286
''...mercy shaII foIIow me
aII the days of my Iife...

17:16.411 --> 17:17.496
''and I wiII dweII....''

17:17.621 --> 17:20.374
For all l knew,

17:34.763 --> 17:36.223

But you can't just go waIking up

That's what you looking at

24:05.654 --> 24:07.531
They call me Uncle Deuce

24:07.656 --> 24:11.034
After Tupac, everybody wanted to be
a gangsta rapper.

24:11.702 --> 24:15.164
And if Tupac wasn't dead,
Deuce's rapping would've killed him.

24:15.289 --> 24:17.791
l might take your bones

-It's your fauIt I got caught.
-My fauIt?

25:54.054 --> 25:56.390

I wouIdn't have got caught.

25:56.473 --> 25:59.268
-Then who are you?
-I'm in fucking heII!

25:59.476 --> 26:01.770
Living in a basement

26:01.895 --> 26:03.397

26:13.323 --> 26:15.325
-You son of a--
-Let him go, Roy.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.524
If you reaIIy want it, you can have it.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.748
Are you reIated to Mr. Majestic?

27:03.373 --> 27:04.374
No.

27:15.552 --> 27:17.095
l had my own space...

27:17.221 --> 27:20.182
and l could concentrate
on my dream of being a rapper.

27:21.475 --> 27:24.228
Young Caesar, first tape, first song.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.688
Gotta Get Outta Hell.

27:28.524 --> 27:31.360
Fire at my feet, fiends all around

27:31.568 --> 27:34.571
Don't cross the yellow tape
Homicide's in town

27:36.031 --> 27:37.783
Homicide's in town.

27:40.828 --> 27:43.330
Fire at my feet, fiends all around

27:43.413 --> 27:46.416
Don't cross the yellow tape
Homicide's in town

27:46.500 --> 27:48.460
Homicide's.... Homicide's in town.

27:49.253 --> 27:51.380
Why the fuck I ain't write it down?

27:52.422 --> 27:54.424
Damn, I'm fucking hungry.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.180
After three hours,
l gave up my career as a rapper...

28:00.305 --> 28:01.431
and went back to selling coke.

28:03.517 --> 28:05.978
The thing about being a coke dealer
on the corner...

28:06.103 --> 28:07.688
it was lousy pay.

28:07.896 --> 28:11.233
And if you added up all the hours
and time spent waiting around...

28:11.316 --> 28:13.318
it was like minimum wage.

28:13.652 --> 28:16.655
And if you added in the time
you were likely to spend in prison...

28:16.780 --> 28:18.782
it was less than minimum wage.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.159
But then, one day...

28:20.284 --> 28:22.703
-Baking soda.
-...evertyhing changed.

28:22.786 --> 28:23.871

28:29.710 --> 28:32.546
-Add that shit to that.

28:51.106 --> 28:53.442
-Stir that shit up a IittIe.
-What the fuck is that?

28:53.525 --> 28:56.069
It's a refreshing drink, that's what it is.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.405
Make that shit chiII.

28:58.489 --> 29:00.741

29:03.494 --> 29:05.787
-See that?
-What's that supposed to be?

29:06.747 --> 29:09.208
-I don't know, man.
-Go figure it out, man.

29:12.002 --> 29:14.505
-Pure crystaI.
-Yeah.

29:15.339 --> 29:17.841
Now the nigga got his own
drug-manufacturing company...

29:18.509 --> 29:19.968
just Iike Merck.

29:21.595 --> 29:24.848
See this shit?
This gonna take us out of the ghetto.

29:26.058 --> 29:28.143
But there are ruIes to the house.

29:29.144 --> 29:30.479
RuIe number one:

29:56.380 --> 29:57.381

29:57.464 --> 30:00.092

or no one to get you through.

30:00.217 --> 30:03.178

30:17.234 --> 30:19.319

Everybody had their own territory.

30:25.284 --> 30:27.536

30:28.871 --> 30:31.206

So that was the crew.
Antwan, Justice, Keryl and myself.

This guy is iII.

32:50.888 --> 32:53.182
You don't wanna battle me in the street
with my heat

32:53.307 --> 32:55.392
Them things'll bust
with Dangerous

32:55.517 --> 32:57.060
I need some space...

32:57.186 --> 32:59.938
'cause y'aII are riding Dangerous' nuts
a IittIe too hard over here.

33:00.063 --> 33:01.940
This is street life, all right
The only life l know

33:02.065 --> 33:04.359
Bag it up, hit the block
Watch the product go

33:04.484 --> 33:07.154
l got supreme clientele
So it's sale after sale

33:07.654 --> 33:09.948
Fire at my feet, fiends all around

33:10.073 --> 33:11.825
Don't cross the yellow tape

33:15.245 --> 33:17.498
-Let's go.
-Why?

33:17.581 --> 33:20.542
Y'aII gotta go, too. Come on.
We gotta go to work.

33:21.752 --> 33:24.880
l was always the first up.
No matter how hard we partied...

33:24.963 --> 33:27.341
l made sure my crew worked
twice as hard.

33:29.426 --> 33:32.387
The busiest days for us
were the 1st and the 1 5th...

33:32.513 --> 33:34.806
when the welfare checks came in.

33:41.939 --> 33:45.192
Hey, hey, man.
You're damaging my merchandise.

33:45.609 --> 33:47.110
-You Iike cars?
-Yeah.

33:47.236 --> 33:50.030
You know, we couId use some heIp

33:50.113 --> 33:51.824
since you Iike
putting fingerprints on things.

33:51.949 --> 33:55.369
-No, I ain't washing no cars, man.
-So what you wanna do?

33:55.577 --> 33:58.705

-Yeah? You got a Iicense?

33:59.456 --> 34:00.958

-I teII you what.

34:01.083 --> 34:04.628
You get you a Iicense, you get you

34:06.129 --> 34:07.589
Oh, I'II get the money.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.676
Crack meant money,
money meant power...

34:10.801 --> 34:11.927
and power meant war.

34:12.010 --> 34:13.428
Yo, come here, man. Come here.

34:13.554 --> 34:15.264
We shot the Colombians.

34:20.978 --> 34:22.396
They shot us.

34:31.321 --> 34:34.116
Crackheads robbed the Korean store
so many times...

34:34.241 --> 34:35.701
poor guy went crazy.

34:50.257 --> 34:53.135
Things got so hot after the death
of those innocent kids...

34:53.260 --> 34:56.597
that even Levar Cahill
had to show up to the funeral.

34:59.850 --> 35:02.144
But his real intentions were
to cool things down...

35:02.227 --> 35:03.604
with the Colombians.

35:12.362 --> 35:14.156
Listen, everything's gonna be aII right.

35:14.239 --> 35:16.116
Look at this nigga OdeII.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.328
How much money you think
his motherfucking teeth worth?

35:19.411 --> 35:21.830
$100,000? $200,000?

35:30.422 --> 35:33.008
I got someone I want you to meet, man.

35:34.384 --> 35:35.719
Yo, Marcus.

35:39.223 --> 35:41.642

35:46.939 --> 35:50.150

36:10.420 --> 36:12.256
This here her baby boy.

36:13.006 --> 36:14.716
Ain't this a bitch?

36:17.135 --> 36:19.680
So you out there grinding,
making some money for me, huh?

36:19.763 --> 36:21.014
Yeah.

36:21.181 --> 36:22.558
Mr. CahiII...

36:22.724 --> 36:25.310
you Iike a god to me.

36:26.061 --> 36:27.396
Like a god.

36:28.689 --> 36:29.815

36:31.191 --> 36:32.401
I am God.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.571

36:36.196 --> 36:38.574

36:42.369 --> 36:43.537
Five-O.

36:49.042 --> 36:53.172
Motherfuckers got more shit on me,
put me away for 20 or 30 years.

36:53.338 --> 36:55.924
That's why I got to pay them
so much money.

37:01.138 --> 37:03.599
Levar put his arms around Delgato...

37:03.932 --> 37:05.934
and just like that, the war ended.

37:06.059 --> 37:08.729
Yes, that is it.
That's what I want, right there.

37:08.812 --> 37:11.773
Okay, Iadies, this time what I want,
you're with Dangerous....

37:11.857 --> 37:14.318
And how did you get invoIved
with Dangerous?

37:15.152 --> 37:17.029
Kid Iost his chain, man.

37:17.529 --> 37:21.492
Out here in the streets,

37:22.326 --> 37:24.786
I found it, gave it back to him.
That's what I do.

37:24.870 --> 37:27.623
I protect him, you know?
Try to Iook out for him.

37:29.750 --> 37:32.628
-What about those guys?

37:32.628 --> 37:33.003

Cops sitting on Levar's house

47:15.460 --> 47:18.714
-What do you think?
-Sit tight. Let it bIow over.

47:22.259 --> 47:23.844
Damn right.

47:24.928 --> 47:26.513
Let it bIow over.

47:33.729 --> 47:35.898

47:36.982 --> 47:39.234
Parking Iot out by the beach.

47:40.944 --> 47:44.740

48:07.721 --> 48:09.723

48:12.684 --> 48:15.729
The minute you see him,

48:15.854 --> 48:19.900
Listen, either stop taIking about it,
or do something.

48:20.025 --> 48:22.653
How am I gonna do something
if I don't know where he at?

48:23.654 --> 48:25.447
Then Iet it bIow over.

48:39.378 --> 48:40.337

48:59.523 --> 49:02.151
Why don't you bring her backstage,

49:57.748 --> 50:00.709
-I'm aII right. I'm aII right.
-Just don't try to move him.

50:00.876 --> 50:02.419
-Lay back.
-I'II get a ambuIance.

50:02.544 --> 50:03.504
Lay back.

50:03.629 --> 50:05.547
Forget about that.
Just bring the car, man.

50:17.184 --> 50:19.353
Doctor said he's gonna make it.

50:20.103 --> 50:21.188
Amen.

50:27.110 --> 50:28.946
Put your arm around me?

50:37.663 --> 50:39.623
Want me to take you home?

50:41.583 --> 50:43.210
I don't wanna go home.

50:46.463 --> 50:48.382
Can you turn a Iight on?

50:48.549 --> 50:50.425
It's grimy in here right now.

50:51.176 --> 50:52.845
It's cIeaner in my room.

50:53.303 --> 50:55.097
I can see why
you wouIdn't turn the Iight on.

50:55.180 --> 50:56.723
Watch your step.

51:10.737 --> 51:13.365
-You Iike Rick James?
-No.

51:17.119 --> 51:20.330
-Is this okay for you?
-Yes, thank you.

51:33.343 --> 51:35.470
Your mother was so beautifuI.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.773
-That's me and you.
-Yeah.

51:48.442 --> 51:50.444
I can't beIieve you framed this.

51:52.696 --> 51:54.114
Young Caesar.

51:57.284 --> 51:58.494
Don't go.

52:03.332 --> 52:06.460
-You remember the words to that song?
-What song?

52:06.877 --> 52:08.837
lf l was your best friend

52:09.546 --> 52:11.840

52:28.899 --> 52:31.610
I've been thinking about that song
for 10 years.

52:33.737 --> 52:35.197
Sing some more.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.033
First we get to talking

52:38.116 --> 52:39.952
Then we get to touching

52:40.911 --> 52:43.247
When we get past the phone games

52:49.628 --> 52:51.380
Did you know what that meant,
back then?

52:51.463 --> 52:52.464
No.

52:53.423 --> 52:54.925
My stepdad did.

53:01.598 --> 53:04.685
-Are you my best friend?
-More than that.

53:47.644 --> 53:49.104
He ain't gonna waIk no more.

53:49.229 --> 53:50.606
Who toId you that? Doctor toId you that?

53:50.731 --> 53:51.732

53:58.030 --> 53:59.156
Man.

54:05.621 --> 54:08.999
-Let's go take care of this shit now.
-Oh, we gonna take care.

54:09.124 --> 54:11.502
He can't waIk. Can't waIk no more.

54:11.627 --> 54:14.588
Look at him, man.
He's crying aII night and shit.

54:14.713 --> 54:17.174
-I don't wanna hear that shit.
-We gotta send a message.

54:17.299 --> 54:19.927
-Damn, man.
-It's your crew. Your own crew.

54:20.511 --> 54:22.721
AII right. AII right. CharIene.

54:25.974 --> 54:28.644
-What's up?
-I gotta go handIe something.

54:29.144 --> 54:31.772
-What?
-I gotta go handIe some business.

54:35.526 --> 54:38.028
That's not gonna
make him waIk again, Marcus.

54:40.322 --> 54:41.532
Come on, give me my hat.

54:43.826 --> 54:44.785
Hey.

55:00.551 --> 55:02.511
-Is that cIean?

-Majestic.

55:06.807 --> 55:09.852
-Majestic cooI with this?
-Yeah.

55:14.148 --> 55:15.691
PuII over to the Ieft.

55:21.989 --> 55:24.658
I don't got a good feeIing about this shit.

55:24.741 --> 55:27.661
-There's four of them.
-Yeah. It's fucked up. Let's go home.

55:27.786 --> 55:28.954
-Go.
-Give me the gun.

55:29.079 --> 55:30.622
-Huh?
-Give me the gun!

55:32.499 --> 55:33.876
What the fuck...

55:39.381 --> 55:41.925
Who's this nigga?
What the fuck you want?

55:44.553 --> 55:46.513
Don't do it, pIease!
PIease don't fucking do it!

55:46.638 --> 55:50.225
Don't fucking do it!
Don't fucking.... Papa!

55:53.270 --> 55:56.690
Oh, fuck!

56:06.116 --> 56:07.910
-You okay?
-Drive.

56:10.329 --> 56:13.832
...we were complicitous ,
as a country, in narcotics traffic...

56:13.957 --> 56:18.086
at the same time
as we're spending countless dollars...

56:18.253 --> 56:20.714
in this country to try to get rid
of this problem.

56:20.923 --> 56:21.882
lt's mind-boggling.

56:22.007 --> 56:23.050
What's up?

56:23.133 --> 56:25.010
ln 1987, Oliver North was investigated...

56:25.135 --> 56:27.930
for his role in a covert
money-for-arms operation.

56:29.181 --> 56:30.766
You're aII right.

56:45.322 --> 56:46.740
Breaking out.

56:50.077 --> 56:51.954
It's time for bed, huh?

56:58.210 --> 57:01.463
-What happened?
-Nothing.

57:02.005 --> 57:05.133
Don't Iie to me.
You got bIood on your shoes.

57:08.804 --> 57:10.973
Maybe this Iife isn't for me.

57:12.683 --> 57:16.812
-Did you kiII him?
-No. I shouId've.

57:22.609 --> 57:26.780
Men hide their emotions.
You bury yours, Marcus.

57:28.448 --> 57:30.742
You're you and I'm me, CharIene.

57:37.875 --> 57:40.752
The cops didn't find that gun
they came looking for.

57:40.878 --> 57:42.671
They found something else instead.

57:42.796 --> 57:44.256
-What's this?
-That's your shit.

57:44.339 --> 57:46.884
My shit?
Why wouId I keep my shit here?

57:47.009 --> 57:48.427
You're fucked, man.

57:49.219 --> 57:52.472
Man, that shit ain't ours!
What the fuck, man!

57:58.312 --> 58:00.063
Never seen him before.

58:03.235 --> 58:05.404
Yeah, never seen him before.

58:08.698 --> 58:10.867
AII right, y'aII, settIe down.

58:11.076 --> 58:13.161
Listen up and pay attention.

58:15.455 --> 58:17.833
My respect has been taken from me.

58:20.335 --> 58:22.671
Who authorized the CoIombian hit?

58:32.472 --> 58:33.765
AII right.

58:34.933 --> 58:39.563
Without getting too bibIicaI and shit,
vioIence onIy begets more vioIence.

58:40.272 --> 58:42.774
It does not beget more money...

58:43.442 --> 58:47.904
which is the reason I thought we were
aII here in the first fucking pIace.

58:49.156 --> 58:52.242
Now, I'm going away
for a short period of time...

58:52.367 --> 58:56.121
to pay a poIiticaI debt
to our iIIustrious poIice department.

58:57.330 --> 59:00.834
And whiIe I'm away,
I don't want no fucking drama...

59:01.668 --> 59:02.878
on our streets...

59:04.546 --> 59:06.256
about anything...

59:06.840 --> 59:10.552
by anyone that's going to draw heat...

59:10.886 --> 59:13.513
or attention to us in any way...

59:13.889 --> 59:18.351
unIess you have my fucking permission.

59:20.896 --> 59:24.858
Is there any nigga here
in PeIham HaII...

59:26.068 --> 59:29.362
that is uncIear about
what the fuck I just said?

59:31.448 --> 59:32.491
Good.

59:41.958 --> 59:46.838
So now, for aII you
hearing-impaired motherfuckers...

59:47.506 --> 59:49.257
whiIe Levar's down...

59:50.926 --> 59:52.385
I'm number one.

59:53.762 --> 59:55.889
So now, if you have any probIems...

59:56.848 --> 59:58.225

01:00:00.685 --> 01:00:03.897

01:00:13.615 --> 01:00:14.783

01:00:16.118 --> 01:00:17.369

01:00:26.878 --> 01:00:30.215
Now, next time you have a probIem,

01:00:31.883 --> 01:00:34.928
See, now you gonna have
to take the faII for this buIIshit.

01:00:35.011 --> 01:00:38.432
-Cops, man, they pIanted that shit.
-No, they didn't.

01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:41.643
We know who's doing what.

01:00:42.936 --> 01:00:45.814
See, now be carefuI
who you Iet in your house.

01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:48.108
'Cause someone cIose to you
is using.

01:01:11.506 --> 01:01:12.674
Soap up.

01:01:13.258 --> 01:01:14.968
Being reaI cheap on the soap.

01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:18.054
And y'aII can turn the water up
a IittIe bit in here.

01:01:31.193 --> 01:01:33.153
Yo, man! Guard!

01:01:33.236 --> 01:01:35.697
Fight! We got a fight over here!

01:02:19.116 --> 01:02:20.742
You saved my Iife.

01:02:20.992 --> 01:02:21.993
Let's go.

01:02:22.077 --> 01:02:23.078
Hmm-hmm.

01:02:25.122 --> 01:02:26.915
This way. Keep going.

01:02:27.833 --> 01:02:28.875
Why?

01:02:32.712 --> 01:02:36.425
I don't know.
Looked Iike you needed saving.

01:02:41.096 --> 01:02:42.180
What's your name?

01:02:43.473 --> 01:02:44.599
Marcus.

01:02:46.101 --> 01:02:48.061
Bama. Nice to meet you.

01:02:50.647 --> 01:02:54.651
-Bama. You from AIabama?
-No, North CaroIina.

01:02:56.528 --> 01:02:59.781
North CaroIina?
So why they caII you Bama?

01:03:01.283 --> 01:03:03.243
I didn't want foIks caIIing me Lina.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:03.887
Somebody wanted me to kill myself.

01:04:05.972 --> 01:04:07.641
Thought about it.

01:04:08.308 --> 01:04:10.227
Thought about my mother.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:16.066
l was in a tomb, just like her...

01:04:18.693 --> 01:04:20.821
and l had to find a way out.

01:04:24.574 --> 01:04:26.159
l went forward...

01:04:27.202 --> 01:04:28.703
made my mark.

01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:32.082
lt was either express myself or die.

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:36.211
l know l did a lot of bad things
in my life...

01:04:37.546 --> 01:04:39.005
but from that moment on...

01:04:39.923 --> 01:04:41.591
l decided to tell the truth.

01:04:43.093 --> 01:04:45.262
And l wasn't gonna back down.

01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:03.530
Levar was not expecting
things to change.

01:05:03.822 --> 01:05:05.240
DeaI with it, okay?

01:05:05.365 --> 01:05:09.453
But after the shooting, he wasn't
gonna pay a little political debt.

01:05:11.246 --> 01:05:13.540
He was gonna pay with his life.

01:05:15.751 --> 01:05:17.586
Majestic set him up...

01:05:18.587 --> 01:05:20.422
and blamed it all on Odell.

01:05:20.547 --> 01:05:23.341
This nigga been working
for the CoIombians.

01:05:23.842 --> 01:05:26.762
Betrayed Levar. Cost us money.

01:05:27.929 --> 01:05:29.723
Now, how he gonna pay?

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.601
Let's pay him in diamonds and goId.

01:05:33.852 --> 01:05:38.398
You right, motherfucker.
Them shiny-ass motherfucking teeth.

01:05:46.615 --> 01:05:48.283
I can't trust you?

01:05:50.494 --> 01:05:52.662
Are you working with the CoIombians?

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:02.672
Nigga, you the one set up Levar, nigga!

01:06:03.673 --> 01:06:06.218
That was you who set up Levar, nigga!

01:06:06.301 --> 01:06:09.221
Come on, man!
That was you that set up Levar!

01:06:10.847 --> 01:06:12.099
Oh, shit.

01:06:14.976 --> 01:06:18.355
Everybody reIax. We're aII friends here.

01:06:20.273 --> 01:06:22.442
Levar fucked your bitch!

01:06:23.819 --> 01:06:26.363
You got a Iot of mouth on you, OdeII.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.284
Levar fucked your bitch, nigga!

01:06:32.369 --> 01:06:34.830
-Yeah, babe?
-Levar fucked Katrina.

01:06:49.761 --> 01:06:52.305
Majestic began his rise to the top...

01:06:52.597 --> 01:06:54.975
and Dangerous crowned it all
with a song.

01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:06.236
People got shot.

01:07:08.488 --> 01:07:10.282
People disappeared.

01:07:12.075 --> 01:07:14.786
And Majestic felt like
nobody could touch him.

01:07:18.123 --> 01:07:21.293
Yeah, turn my music up.

01:07:21.376 --> 01:07:23.170
Turn it up in my headphones
a little bit, son.

01:07:23.295 --> 01:07:24.504
Yeah, we're gonna have to see.

01:07:24.629 --> 01:07:27.549
What up? Yo, Majestic! You!
What up, baby?

01:07:27.632 --> 01:07:31.178
Yeah. Yeah. lt's like this. Come on.

01:07:31.303 --> 01:07:34.598
Niggas that pull their heat
And get shook, die on the streets

01:07:34.723 --> 01:07:38.393
You can't look weak
Niggas'll lay you down six feet

01:07:38.518 --> 01:07:42.105
And when you lay down
You keep an eye open when you sleep

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:45.859
We took the food out your belly, nigga
How you gonna eat?

01:07:45.984 --> 01:07:48.528
You want me
You can find me on the block

01:07:48.653 --> 01:07:49.696
See you in the morning.

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:53.700
And l will squeeze off rounds and watch
them slugs split your hairpiece

01:07:53.784 --> 01:07:57.454
We run these streets
Where murderers and gangstas meet

01:07:57.579 --> 01:07:58.580
Black skull, nigga

01:07:58.705 --> 01:08:02.542
We pull the ice and gold
Straight out your teeth up in the NYC

01:08:14.096 --> 01:08:16.932
Now you Iisten, gangster. Listen.

01:08:21.937 --> 01:08:24.106
-Where's Majestic?
-No, man, no, man!

01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:29.861
TeII Majestic we caIIed.

01:08:36.576 --> 01:08:39.162
You know, I ain't never trusted foIks.

01:08:42.416 --> 01:08:44.292
See, where I grew up...

01:08:44.751 --> 01:08:46.920
there was a whoIe bunch...

01:08:47.504 --> 01:08:49.296
of jeaIous cats.

01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:54.594
They used to be mad
'cause I was Iight-skinned, you know?

01:08:55.595 --> 01:08:58.849
They used to grab me after schooI
when I was in first grade and be Iike:

01:08:58.974 --> 01:09:01.435
''Smack him and watch him turn red.''

01:09:02.727 --> 01:09:06.898
So I got me a screwdriver and started
carrying that with me to schooI.

01:09:06.982 --> 01:09:08.483
They ain't smack me no more.

01:09:12.194 --> 01:09:15.866
-What's wrong with you, man?
-I just wanna kiII somebody.

01:09:18.076 --> 01:09:20.537
-Who?
-Anybody.

01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:26.917
There's a whoIe Iot of anybodies
in the worId, man.

01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:32.758
You know,
I had this image in my head...

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:35.510
of Rick James kiIIing my mama.

01:09:38.388 --> 01:09:41.515
I mean that.
I know Rick James ain't kiII my mama.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.810
He just favored this dude named SIim,
you know.

01:09:47.064 --> 01:09:49.232
WeII, what you got in your head now?

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:52.444
AII kinds of images.

01:09:59.284 --> 01:10:02.204
lt usually goes down
over money and whores

01:10:02.287 --> 01:10:05.248
But lil' homie, in my hood
When it rains it pours

01:10:05.373 --> 01:10:06.333
This is real

01:10:06.416 --> 01:10:08.251
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours

01:10:08.376 --> 01:10:11.088
Hollow-tips and Talons
When it rains it pours

01:10:11.213 --> 01:10:13.840
You caught in lead showers
Just because

01:10:13.965 --> 01:10:16.885
Niggas ain't playin'
When it rains it pours

01:10:19.096 --> 01:10:23.725
The Colombians hit back at Majestic
by cutting off his supply of drugs.

01:10:26.228 --> 01:10:27.896
Eventually, just like Levar...

01:10:28.021 --> 01:10:31.024
Majestic had to go
shake hands with Delgato.

01:10:32.442 --> 01:10:34.528
But neither were happy about it.

01:10:35.987 --> 01:10:39.825
One shot, one kill, what's the deal?
Yo, what's the deal?

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.245
Listen, lil' homie
When it rains it pours

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:46.248
Hollow-tips and Talons
When it rains it pours

01:10:46.373 --> 01:10:49.209
You caught in lead showers
Just because

01:10:49.292 --> 01:10:52.129
Niggas ain't playin'
When it rains it pours

01:10:52.254 --> 01:10:55.006
Niggas get set up
'Cause when it rains it pours

01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:57.008
End up wet up
'Cause when it rains it pours

01:10:57.092 --> 01:10:58.176
What's up?

01:10:58.593 --> 01:11:01.471
-You need a manager.
-A manager?

01:11:01.721 --> 01:11:03.723
ln my hood, when it rains it pours

01:11:03.849 --> 01:11:06.726
Ain't nothin' changed
Niggas doin' the same old shit

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:09.771

And them same old clips

01:11:10.397 --> 01:11:12.482

01:11:12.607 --> 01:11:15.777
-Come on, Iet me get in my house.

You're Iooking good.

01:11:28.665 --> 01:11:31.585
Thank you. I did it for you.

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.715
-Did you miss me?
-Yeah, I missed you.

01:11:37.507 --> 01:11:38.592
Yeah?

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:42.179
How about you? How you doing?

01:11:42.471 --> 01:11:45.932

You know.
I ain't been doing much taIking.

01:11:52.147 --> 01:11:54.816
You aIways have so much to say

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:56.777
How come you're quiet now?

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.695
It's a different part of the brain.

01:12:01.073 --> 01:12:02.532
The part you never Iet anyone see?

01:12:03.283 --> 01:12:04.493
I Iet you see.

01:12:09.039 --> 01:12:11.291
-Do you Iove me?
-You know I Iove you.

01:12:13.543 --> 01:12:16.046
-Are you stiII in Iove with me, though?
-Yes.

01:12:18.507 --> 01:12:19.674
I'm pregnant.

01:12:24.846 --> 01:12:26.973
-You sure?
-Yeah.

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:31.353
You gonna keep it?

01:12:36.525 --> 01:12:37.692
Do you want me to?

01:12:37.818 --> 01:12:38.819

01:12:39.528 --> 01:12:42.739
But, you know, I was just thinking,

01:12:44.199 --> 01:12:47.744

You won't be abIe to dance.

01:12:49.955 --> 01:12:51.832

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.598
Dangerous in the booth
But not in the streets

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.059
You a Jehovah Witness, nigga!

01:20:07.768 --> 01:20:10.979
Your daddy a doctor in Riverdale,

He is taIented.

01:20:15.108 --> 01:20:17.110
You talk that shit,

01:20:17.235 --> 01:20:19.279
We got to stop this

01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:21.615

01:21:10.664 --> 01:21:12.749
Motherfucker touched my kid.

01:21:16.253 --> 01:21:18.213
Nobody touches my famiIy.

01:21:19.005 --> 01:21:21.049
I want security, 24/7.

01:21:22.259 --> 01:21:23.343

01:21:24.928 --> 01:21:29.182
Look, Marcus, man, I'm sorry,

My hood, there's no telling

01:22:00.088 --> 01:22:01.840
Across the street from Lucifer, he's only

Man, who's he taIking about?

01:22:04.134 --> 01:22:06.636
Nigga, turn around and push the button.

01:22:06.762 --> 01:22:08.305
You'll be losing your brain

01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:11.099
And your boss is a bitch
He snitched on Levar

01:22:11.224 --> 01:22:13.852

''CIick cIack pow, officer down.''

01:22:39.795 --> 01:22:41.713

From this day on, he ain't nothing to me.

01:22:46.468 --> 01:22:47.636
Nothing.

01:22:50.305 --> 01:22:53.141
End it. And get rid of the manager, too.

01:22:53.266 --> 01:22:55.644
I don't wanna get anybody kiIIed, man.

01:22:57.062 --> 01:22:58.271
Let's go.

01:23:30.846 --> 01:23:33.181
Since Majestic couldn't get to us...

01:23:33.306 --> 01:23:34.725
he made sure
we couldn't get a record deal.

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.687
It's Young Caesar.

01:23:48.905 --> 01:23:52.868
Fuck, man. This shit is crazy, man.
They trying to shut us down.

01:23:53.034 --> 01:23:56.830
Fuck it. Why don't we just go back

01:23:57.456 --> 01:24:00.667
-I can't do that.
-I ain't taIking about crack.

01:24:02.210 --> 01:24:05.422
-I got something eIse in mind.

01:24:05.714 --> 01:24:07.758

01:24:25.734 --> 01:24:27.986
Yeah, we gonna do it.
So, what you think, man?

01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:29.863
This is a robbery.

01:24:29.988 --> 01:24:31.990

01:24:32.074 --> 01:24:34.576

01:24:35.494 --> 01:24:38.163
-What the fuck is that, man?
-It's Spanish.

01:24:38.622 --> 01:24:40.999
You don't know

01:24:42.125 --> 01:24:45.378
What the fuck is que sera?

Love will get you killed.

01:26:15.177 --> 01:26:16.678
You have a gift.

01:26:19.222 --> 01:26:20.682
You're a poet.

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:24.603
Don't Iet nobody take that from you.

'Cause when I used to Iook at you,

01:33:39.663 --> 01:33:41.164

I don't want him to see you Iike this.

01:34:26.418 --> 01:34:28.128

01:34:40.348 --> 01:34:42.476
You can do without anything?

01:34:51.068 --> 01:34:52.944
Can you do without me?

01:34:54.529 --> 01:34:56.948

You love your baby mama

To get this cake

Oh, she don't know it
Damn, okay, we'll wait

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:53.977
'Cause you can pray for a miracle

01:38:56.188 --> 01:38:57.147
What's wrong?

01:38:57.272 --> 01:38:59.232
My voice don't sound the same.

01:38:59.399 --> 01:39:00.734
It's better.

01:39:03.862 --> 01:39:06.865
-It's got more pain in it.
-For reaIIy.

01:39:07.616 --> 01:39:09.117

Your ass could get killed

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:23.090

Tryin' to make a move

Comin' in when your shorty

01:39:26.176 --> 01:39:29.262
Even though she cause the drama
You love your baby mama

01:39:29.388 --> 01:39:31.765

To get this cake

01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:33.600

01:39:34.643 --> 01:39:37.104
l'll whip your head, boy

Top feeIs so much better

01:39:40.649 --> 01:39:42.567
So much better.

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:46.279
Nigga, you's a window shopper

01:39:46.363 --> 01:39:49.116
Mad at me, l think l know why

01:39:49.241 --> 01:39:51.493
Nigga, you's a window shopper

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:54.538

Looking at shit you can't buy

01:39:54.663 --> 01:39:57.082
Nigga, you's a window shopper

01:39:57.165 --> 01:40:00.168
ln the dealership
Trying to get a test drive

01:40:00.293 --> 01:40:02.504
Nigga, you's a window shopper

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:05.674
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:08.260
Summertime
White Porsche Carrera is milky

01:40:08.385 --> 01:40:10.971
l'm on the grind
Let my paper stack when l'm filthy

01:40:11.096 --> 01:40:13.807
lt's funny how niggas
Get to screw-facing at me

01:40:13.932 --> 01:40:16.685
Anyhow, they ain't got
The heart to get at me

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:19.438
l'll get down
Southside's the hood that l come from

01:40:19.521 --> 01:40:22.274
So l don't cruise through nobody hood
Without my gun

01:40:22.357 --> 01:40:24.943
You know the kid
Ain't goin' for all that bullshit

01:40:25.026 --> 01:40:27.738
Try and stick me, l'm a let off a full clip

01:40:27.863 --> 01:40:30.365
Everybody mad
When their paper don't stack right

01:40:30.490 --> 01:40:33.160
But when l come around
Y'all niggas better act right

01:40:33.285 --> 01:40:37.164
When we got the tops down
You can hear the system thump

01:40:37.247 --> 01:40:40.876
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'
Shut your block down

01:40:41.042 --> 01:40:43.879
Who's your daddy, boy? Huh?

01:40:44.004 --> 01:40:44.880
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.922
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'

01:40:46.047 --> 01:40:47.799
Who's your daddy?

01:40:48.425 --> 01:40:52.429
l think l know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper

01:40:52.554 --> 01:40:55.974
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

01:41:02.522 --> 01:41:04.274
You have to go back?

01:41:05.650 --> 01:41:06.693
Yeah.

01:41:07.944 --> 01:41:10.363
There's some things
I need the answers to.

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:13.658
I'd rather die Iike a man
than Iive Iike a coward.

01:41:20.916 --> 01:41:22.918
Majestic reaIIy Ioved your mama.

01:41:24.086 --> 01:41:25.796
One day he came to me and asked...

01:41:25.921 --> 01:41:28.965
if there was anything
between me and your mother...

01:41:29.091 --> 01:41:30.717
and I Iied to him.

01:41:31.426 --> 01:41:34.304
l told him
l was only trying to protect her.

01:41:35.263 --> 01:41:37.224
lt was far more than that.

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:42.062
Your mama didn't want
to take my family life from me...

01:41:44.314 --> 01:41:46.483
but she gave me everything...

01:41:47.692 --> 01:41:49.319
and I took it aII.

01:41:51.279 --> 01:41:55.117
In the end, I didn't protect her.

01:41:56.201 --> 01:41:57.577
Sometimes...

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:02.207
l feel like l killed her myself.

01:42:04.459 --> 01:42:06.336
When I first saw you...

01:42:08.213 --> 01:42:10.173
you was a IittIe baby.

01:42:11.967 --> 01:42:14.428
I couIdn't even Iook you in the eye.

01:42:16.722 --> 01:42:18.265
What you saying?

01:42:20.642 --> 01:42:23.437
One night, after midnight...

01:42:24.896 --> 01:42:28.400
l was sitting here.
Word came through that you was gone.

01:42:29.276 --> 01:42:30.694
You was dead.

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:34.948
For the first time in my fucking Iife,
I feII to my knees...

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:38.201
and I prayed to God
that nothing happened.

01:42:38.535 --> 01:42:40.620
So I prayed to your mama.

01:42:41.371 --> 01:42:43.665
I asked her to forgive me...

01:42:43.915 --> 01:42:46.793
and to taIk to God for me
to bring you back.

01:42:49.838 --> 01:42:51.590
l don't deserve you.

01:42:57.429 --> 01:42:59.890
Rocks that l copped
From proceeds from the spot

01:43:00.015 --> 01:43:02.851
l got the energy to win
l'm full of adrenaline

01:43:02.976 --> 01:43:05.437
Play the curve and get nauseous
Watchin' the spinner spin

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.106
l made plans to make it
A prisoner of the state

01:43:08.190 --> 01:43:10.776
Now l can invite your ass
out to my estate

01:43:10.859 --> 01:43:13.612
Them hollow-tips bent me up
But l'm back in shape

01:43:13.695 --> 01:43:16.823
Pour Cristal in the blender
Make a protein shake

01:43:17.115 --> 01:43:18.617
He's coming, y'all.

01:43:18.992 --> 01:43:22.454
Our own Young Caesar
is coming back to Pelham Hall...

01:43:22.579 --> 01:43:24.748
July 4, 8:00 p.m. Be there.

01:43:24.873 --> 01:43:27.459

01:43:27.542 --> 01:43:29.294
So l hustle

01:43:29.377 --> 01:43:32.923
Nigga, you gettin' in my way
When l'm tryin' to get mine

01:43:33.048 --> 01:43:34.674
And l'll buck you

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:38.011
l don't care who you run with
Or where you from

01:43:38.345 --> 01:43:40.180
Nigga, fuck you

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:43.683
l want the finer things in my life

01:43:43.892 --> 01:43:45.268
So l hustle

01:43:45.394 --> 01:43:48.313
l don't know shit about gymnastics
l somersault bricks

01:43:48.397 --> 01:43:50.899
Black Talons start flyin'
When a nigga flip

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:53.985
Yo, nigga, you gotta
turn this shit the fuck off.

01:43:54.236 --> 01:43:57.739
What you want me to do?
I got this man in the back.

01:44:00.742 --> 01:44:02.536
-Stop the crack!
-We don't want no more!

01:44:02.619 --> 01:44:05.872
-Stop the crack!
-Give us back our street!

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:09.876
Papi, do you have any controI
over your neighborhood?

01:44:10.001 --> 01:44:11.878
Don't fucking worry about nothing,

01:44:12.003 --> 01:44:14.673
-You gonna Iet him pIay this concert?
-You worry too much, Mira.

01:44:14.756 --> 01:44:16.633
Man, Iisten to this.

01:44:16.758 --> 01:44:18.719
-Stop the crack!
-Give us back our neighborhood!

01:44:18.802 --> 01:44:23.598
Stop the crack! Stop the crack!

01:44:44.786 --> 01:44:46.747
Does he have to do this?

01:44:47.914 --> 01:44:49.499
I think he does.

01:44:57.174 --> 01:45:00.385
Antwan. Remember,
you keep him covered, aII right?

01:45:00.469 --> 01:45:01.762

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.559
So what's happening, man?

01:45:10.812 --> 01:45:12.105
Bye, Nana.

01:45:15.067 --> 01:45:19.362
Last time I saw your mother, she was
saying goodbye in that front room.

01:45:22.866 --> 01:45:25.243
You Ieave enough protection here?

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:28.997
Yeah, y'aII gonna be aII right. Yeah.

01:45:30.499 --> 01:45:32.667
This one is IegaIIy owned.

01:45:34.544 --> 01:45:36.963
If it comes down to it,
I got a knife in that drawer.

01:45:37.089 --> 01:45:40.092
That's aII I know.
That's aII any mother knows.

01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:42.469
I'II be okay, Nana.

01:45:44.012 --> 01:45:47.307
You can't take that from a person,
being a protector.

01:45:47.682 --> 01:45:49.684
That's aII any man or woman is at
the end of the day anyway...

01:45:49.684 --> 01:45:50.477
That's aII any man or woman is at
the end of the day anyway...

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.520
is a protector.

01:45:52.562 --> 01:45:55.315
Protector of a chiId
who wiII one day die.

01:45:58.318 --> 01:45:59.528
Marcus...

01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:03.990
when I Iook in your eyes,
I don't know what you thinking.

01:46:04.699 --> 01:46:06.618
And you've been Iike that

01:46:06.701 --> 01:46:08.829

01:46:09.287 --> 01:46:11.498
-I'II be okay.
-No...

01:46:12.249 --> 01:46:15.001

01:46:22.259 --> 01:46:23.844

-Hey, come on, man, where you going?
-ChiII, partner.

Easy. Easy. Easy.

01:46:46.908 --> 01:46:50.871
No guns. No arms. We come in peace.

01:46:57.753 --> 01:47:01.339
Everybody's friends here, right?
Everybody just reIax.

01:47:03.592 --> 01:47:06.053
Can I have a word in private
with you, man?

01:47:17.522 --> 01:47:19.775
You reaIIy wanna go through with this?

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:23.820
You wanna go out there
and diss me in my own hood?

01:47:24.071 --> 01:47:25.739
In front of my own peopIe?

01:47:30.452 --> 01:47:33.163
You know I can't Iet you do that, Marcus.

01:47:34.623 --> 01:47:36.500
Here's what I can do.

01:47:36.625 --> 01:47:39.878
I'II Iet you come out there,

01:47:40.295 --> 01:47:42.589
-Show some respect.
-No.

01:47:47.719 --> 01:47:49.054

01:47:51.807 --> 01:47:53.308
You know I Iove you.

01:47:53.892 --> 01:47:57.270
You're a stubborn motherfucker,

Give me a hug, man.

01:48:15.372 --> 01:48:17.416
But, you know, before she died...

01:48:17.541 --> 01:48:19.668
I fucked her, and then I kiIIed her.

01:48:39.354 --> 01:48:42.941
This is how I kiIIed your mama!

01:48:50.866 --> 01:48:53.201

Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
And drama means nothin'

01:52:26.498 --> 01:52:29.209
lt's part of the game
Catch me in the coupe, switchin' lanes

01:52:29.292 --> 01:52:30.585
Or in the jeweler's, switchin' chains

01:52:30.711 --> 01:52:33.380
l upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS

01:52:33.505 --> 01:52:35.716
Rocks that l copped
From proceeds from the spot

01:52:35.799 --> 01:52:38.635
l got the energy to win
l'm full of adrenaline

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:41.179
Play the curve and get nauseous
Watchin' the spinner spin

01:52:41.263 --> 01:52:44.141
l made plans to make it
A prisoner of the state

01:52:44.266 --> 01:52:46.601
Now l can invite your ass
out to my estate

01:52:46.727 --> 01:52:49.396
Them hollow-tips bent me up
But l'm back in shape

01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:52.023
Pour Cristal in the blender
And make a protein shake

01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:54.901
l'm like the East Coast's
number one playboy, B

01:52:54.985 --> 01:52:57.654
Hugh Hefner'll tell you
He ain't got shit on me

01:52:57.779 --> 01:53:00.282
The Feds watching me
lcy, they can't stop me

01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:03.702
Racist pointing at me:
"Look at Niggerace." Hello!

01:53:03.785 --> 01:53:06.371
l want the finer things in my life

01:53:06.955 --> 01:53:08.665
So l hustle

01:53:08.999 --> 01:53:12.002
Nigga, you get in my way
When l'm tryin' to get mine

01:53:12.461 --> 01:53:13.795
And l'll buck you

01:53:14.755 --> 01:53:17.340
l don't care who you run with
Or where you from

01:53:17.883 --> 01:53:19.259
Nigga, fuck you

01:53:20.427 --> 01:53:23.055
l want the finer things in my life

01:53:23.221 --> 01:53:24.598
So l hustle

01:53:25.305 --> 01:53:31.508
