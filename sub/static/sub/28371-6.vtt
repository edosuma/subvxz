WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:02.045
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.089 --> 00:04.047
THEY'RE MURDERERS
RAISING PEOPLE

00:04.091 --> 00:05.440
TO GIVE UP
THEIR BODIES.

00:05.483 --> 00:08.138
RUSSELL: WE CAN WAIT 56 YEARS
FOR OUR BABY GIRL,

00:08.182 --> 00:09.705
OR WE CAN GET HER
BACK TONIGHT.

00:09.748 --> 00:12.664
THE MIND OF THE HOST IS ERASED.
THE BRAIN IS LEFT UNHARMED.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.188
- YEAH. YEAH.
- YEAH?

00:14.231 --> 00:16.016
CLARKE: THE PEOPLE FROM EARTH,
HOW MANY OF THEM ARE HOSTS?

00:16.059 --> 00:17.278
WE DON'T KNOW.

00:17.321 --> 00:18.931
SIMONE: THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.542
MURPHY: ECHO MADE HERSELF
A NIGHTBLOOD IN THE LAB,

00:20.585 --> 00:21.673
SAME WAY ABBY
DID TO CLARKE.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.240
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE
BLOOD ALTERATION?

00:23.284 --> 00:25.329
PASS US THE ROPE, AND WE'LL
TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.332
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
- A TEMPORAL FLARE.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.856
DIYOZA: COME ON.
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.164
IN MY DREAMS, I SEE A
COMMANDER WHO FRIGHTENS ME.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.644
SHEIDHEDA,
THE DARK COMMANDER.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.689
THAT'S WHY WE MUST
KEEP TRAINING.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.821
WHO ARE YOU?

00:38.864 --> 00:40.736
JOSEPHINE LIGHTBORNE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.434
HAVE THEY CONVINCED YOU THAT
WE SHOULD LEAVE PARADISE?

00:43.478 --> 00:44.827
WHY WOULD
I LEAVE MY HOME?

00:44.870 --> 00:46.002
YOU'RE NOT CLARKE.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.701
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE IMMORTAL, TOO?

00:49.745 --> 00:53.618
JOSEPHINE: SO CLARKE
WAS A COMMANDER.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.272
NO. I TOLD YOU,

00:55.316 --> 00:57.709
SHE WASN'T
A NIGHTBLOOD THEN.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.103
ABBY MADE ME PUMP
ONTARI'S HEART

01:00.147 --> 01:03.454
WITH MY BARE HANDS SO
HER BRAIN WOULDN'T MELT,

01:03.498 --> 01:04.542
KIND OF GROSS.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.849
HMM, KIND OF BADASS
IF YOU ASK ME.

01:06.892 --> 01:11.114
I DIDN'T,
BUT THANK YOU.

01:11.158 --> 01:14.117
HEY, I AM OFFERING
YOU IMMORTALITY,

01:14.161 --> 01:15.205
A CHANCE AT GODHOOD,

01:15.249 --> 01:16.554
AND YOU CAN'T
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN?

01:16.598 --> 01:18.339
YEAH. WELL, EVEN GODS
NEED TO SLEEP.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.080
WHY DON'T YOU,
BY THE WAY?

01:20.123 --> 01:21.429
SLEEPLESSNESS IS COMMON

01:21.472 --> 01:23.561
THE FIRST FEW NIGHTS
IN A NEW HOST.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.128
YOU CAN SLEEP
WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,

01:25.172 --> 01:30.264
WHICH WILL BE NEVER UNLESS
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND.

01:30.307 --> 01:32.135
- I HAVEN'T.
- GOOD.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.398
NOW WAKE UP AND SHOW ME
HOW TO BE CLARKE ENOUGH

01:34.442 --> 01:36.008
TO FOOL HER
MOTHER BECAUSE

01:36.052 --> 01:38.576
NO NIGHTBLOOD,
NO DRIVES.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.317
FINE. LIGHTNING ROUND.

01:40.361 --> 01:44.191
WHAT CARD DO YOU PLAY WHEN
ABBY'S ON HER HIGH HORSE?

01:44.234 --> 01:46.758
THE DARK YEAR,
CANNIBALISM. YUM.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.587
WHEN YOU WANT TO
SPRINKLE ON SOME SHAME?

01:49.631 --> 01:51.459
- ADDICTION.
- INSPIRATION?

01:51.502 --> 01:53.765
UH, CLARKE
IN MOUNT WEATHER,

01:53.809 --> 01:55.550
CLARKE IN THE
CITY OF LIGHT,

01:55.593 --> 01:57.595
CLARKE STAYING BEHIND
SO THAT YOU GUYS

01:57.639 --> 01:59.249
COULD GO TO SPACE,
WHICH WAS

01:59.293 --> 02:00.729
FAIRLY AWESOME,
BY THE WAY.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.557
YEAH, UNLESS YOU
GOT IN HER WAY.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.602
OK. YOU'VE
SOFTENED THE GROUND.

02:04.646 --> 02:08.780
SHE'S READY TO BREAK.
TAKE THE KILL SHOT.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.348
DADDY--EXECUTED
FOR TREASON

02:11.392 --> 02:13.263
AND TURNED IN
BY ABBY HERSELF.

02:13.307 --> 02:17.528
NOT BAD. MAYBE YOU
DO PULL THIS OFF.

02:20.792 --> 02:25.145
THAT WOULD BE MADI--
OH, YOU KNOW, YOUR KID.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.972
MM.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.671
CONSIDER IT
A DRESS REHEARSAL.

02:29.714 --> 02:30.759
FINE.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.284
OH, UH-UH-UH.
EASY, KILLER.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.981
FIRST, YOU GET ME
PAST ABBY,

02:36.025 --> 02:38.854
AND THEN I WIPE
MY FRIENDS.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.475
NO, NO, NO.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.173
YOU DON'T INTERRUPT HER
WHEN SHE'S COMMUNING

02:53.216 --> 02:55.653
WITH THE COMMANDERS,
NOT EVEN SHEIDHEDA,

02:55.697 --> 02:58.308
THE DARK COMMANDER.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.227
HE'S GETTING TOO STRONG.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.534
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO DO
THE SEPARATION RITUAL NOW.

03:06.577 --> 03:09.101
I'M NOT LETTING HER SUFFER.
MADI, WAKE UP.

03:09.145 --> 03:11.234
HEY, WAKE UP.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.410
CLARKE?

03:15.673 --> 03:18.023
YEP. THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M HERE.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.852
IT WAS JUST
A NIGHTMARE, OK?

03:20.896 --> 03:22.550
NO. IT WAS
A MEMORY.

03:22.593 --> 03:25.857
- IT WASN'T REAL.
- YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.033
IT IS REAL FOR HER,
AND RIPPING HER OUT

03:28.077 --> 03:29.774
CAN PERMANENTLY
DAMAGE HER.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.733
BUT IT DIDN'T,
DID IT, MADI?

03:31.776 --> 03:33.343
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT JUST DID

03:33.387 --> 03:34.562
TO HER MIND
OR TO THE FLAME.

03:34.605 --> 03:38.870
I'M FINE, OK?
I'M JUST TIRED.

03:38.914 --> 03:42.309
GET SOME REST.
WE SHOULD GO.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.702
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD.

03:44.746 --> 03:48.619
BOTH
OF YOU.

03:59.630 --> 04:03.504
SHUT UP.
LET'S START AGAIN.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.097
UH...

05:14.836 --> 05:16.707
JOSEPHINE:
ECHO, EMORI, RAVEN.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.405
- HEY.
- IT WASN'T ME.

05:18.448 --> 05:22.060
PULL IT TOGETHER.
SHOW TIME.

05:22.974 --> 05:25.107
FAMILY MEETING.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.630
WHERE'S BELLAMY?

05:26.674 --> 05:28.589
- WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?
- WE RAN INTO JORDAN.

05:28.632 --> 05:31.026
EMORI: IS IT TRUE?
THEY'RE IMMORTAL?

05:31.069 --> 05:33.594
I'M SURE HE MADE IT SOUND
WORSE THAN IT REALLY IS.

05:33.637 --> 05:36.248
THEY'RE MURDERERS
AND BODY SNATCHERS.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.468
HOW MUCH WORSE COULD IT BE?
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.949
HEY, HEY, SLOW DOWN.
WHERE ARE WE GONNA GO?

05:40.992 --> 05:43.821
JOSEPHINE: MURPHY'S RIGHT.
THE PLAN DOESN'T CHANGE.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.389
WE STAY AND LEARN AS MUCH
FROM THEM AS WE CAN

05:46.433 --> 05:47.695
SO WE CAN BUILD
OUR OWN COMPOUND.

05:47.738 --> 05:51.220
BELLAMY'S OUT SCOUTING
A LOCATION AS WE SPEAK.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.700
HE WENT WITHOUT ME?

05:52.743 --> 05:56.399
THIS WHOLE BODY-SNATCHING THING
JUST REALLY LIT A FIRE.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.575
HE'S OUT WITH
A FORAGING PARTY.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.142
YOU GUYS WERE
STILL WITH RYKER.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.578
YOU LET HIM GO ALONE?

06:01.622 --> 06:03.363
RAVEN: WAIT A SECOND.
BACK UP, CLARKE.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.844
YOU EXPECT US TO CONTINUE
TO PLAY NICE?

06:09.151 --> 06:10.065
WE DO STILL NEED
RYKER TO TELL US

06:10.108 --> 06:11.501
HOW TO BEND
THE RADIATION FIELD.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.068
NO. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT
MYSELF.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.418
RAVEN, I KNOW
THIS IS HARD,

06:15.462 --> 06:18.247
BUT WE'VE ALL DONE THINGS
THAT WE'RE NOT PROUD OF

06:18.290 --> 06:20.249
TO SURVIVE.

06:20.292 --> 06:23.818
I HAVEN'T.

06:23.861 --> 06:28.823
FINE. I'LL TRY.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.434
I'LL GO WITH HER,

06:31.478 --> 06:34.742
MAKE SURE SHE
DOESN'T START A WAR.

06:39.050 --> 06:42.489
I'M GOING AFTER BELLAMY.

06:46.188 --> 06:49.365
ECHO'S GOING
TO BE A PROBLEM.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.063
I'LL SEND JADE TO
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.414
YEAH. BACK TO BELLAMY,

06:54.457 --> 06:56.590
THERE'S NO FORAGING
PARTY, IS THERE?

06:56.633 --> 06:59.244
SURE, THERE IS,
EVERY MORNING.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.811
HE'S JUST NOT ON IT.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.422
HE FOUND OUT THAT
I WASN'T CLARKE.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.727
SWEAR TO GOD,
IF YOU KILLED HIM--

07:03.771 --> 07:07.427
I DIDN'T, BUT I WILL
IF I HAVE TO.

07:07.470 --> 07:10.125
YOU DON'T GET IT.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.909
IF BELLAMY KNOWS
THAT CLARKE IS DEAD,

07:11.953 --> 07:13.476
THEN ALL OF THIS
IS FOR NOTHING.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.130
HE MAY WAS WELL JUST
KILL HIMSELF NOW.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.827
THAT SEEMS A TAD
IMPULSIVE.

07:16.871 --> 07:20.004
I WAS THINKING OF GIVING
IT TILL SECOND MOON.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.789
THAT'S WHEN THE FORAGING
PARTY COMES BACK

07:21.832 --> 07:24.574
AND ECHO FINDS OUT
I WAS LYING.

07:24.618 --> 07:25.880
YOU HAVE UNTIL
THEN TO GET HIM

07:25.923 --> 07:27.098
ON THE SIDE
OF THE ANGELS.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.317
THE ANGELS BEING US?

07:28.360 --> 07:31.494
WE'RE ALL THE HERO OF
OUR OWN STORY, JOHN.

07:31.538 --> 07:35.150
COME ON.
I'LL TAKE YOU TO HIM.

07:37.587 --> 07:40.547
FOLLOW ECHO.

07:46.814 --> 07:50.252
MURPHY:
UH! LET ME GO!

07:50.295 --> 07:54.299
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING? UH!

07:54.343 --> 07:56.737
LET ME OUT!

07:56.780 --> 07:59.174
MURPHY.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.611
BELLAMY.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.571
HEH. OH, YOU FIGURED
IT OUT, TOO, HUH?

08:04.614 --> 08:10.011
I BET THAT I CAN MAKE
SOMETHING TO CUT THIS STRAP.

08:10.054 --> 08:15.495
- WHO ELSE KNOWS?
- NOBODY YET. JUST US.

08:17.671 --> 08:20.195
TRIED TO OFFER ME
A DEAL.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.284
WHAT DEAL?

08:22.327 --> 08:25.156
WE AGREE NOT
TO RETALIATE,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.768
THEY HELP US
BUILD OUR COMPOUND.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.031
AND WHAT
DID YOU SAY?

08:30.074 --> 08:34.078
WHAT DO YOU
THINK I SAID?

08:34.122 --> 08:35.558
IT'S CLARKE.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.256
SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
MY FAVORITE OF LATE.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.997
SHE'S STILL
ONE OF OURS.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.652
SHE CARED ABOUT
YOU, MURPHY.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.394
I KNOW THAT IT
MAY NOT HAVE ALWAYS

08:45.437 --> 08:48.876
SEEMED LIKE IT,
BUT SHE DID.

08:48.919 --> 08:51.922
SHE CARED
ABOUT ALL OF US,

08:51.966 --> 08:55.839
AND SHE WOULD NEVER
LET US DIE HERE.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.972
YOU SAYING WE SHOULD
TAKE THE DEAL?

08:58.015 --> 09:01.453
NO. NO.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

09:01.497 --> 09:04.892
WE DON'T NEED THEM TO HELP
US BUILD OUR OWN COMPOUND.

09:04.935 --> 09:10.593
WE KILL THEM ALL,
AND WE TAKE THEIRS.

09:11.899 --> 09:16.120
WHERE'S BLODREINA
WHEN YOU NEED HER?

09:29.003 --> 09:31.919
DIYOZA:
BIOLUMINESCENCE. COOL.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.747
OCTAVIA: WHAT IF
IT'S ANOTHER TRAP?

09:33.790 --> 09:38.229
YOU DON'T TRAP SOMETHING
YOU THINK IS ALREADY DEAD.

09:39.709 --> 09:43.365
QUIET. ON ME.

09:47.064 --> 09:50.677
DON'T MOVE. DON'T
MAKE ME SHOOT YOU.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.593
OCTAVIA: AAGH!

09:53.636 --> 09:56.378
AGH! AH!

09:56.421 --> 09:58.685
DROP IT.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.382
AGH!

10:00.425 --> 10:06.083
DIYOZA: OCTAVIA, WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG? MOVE.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.608
OCTAVIA: UHH!

10:14.222 --> 10:18.052
- FASCINATING.
- OH, IT'S SPREADING.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.924
- WHAT IS THIS?
- I ASSUME SHE WENT UNDER,

10:20.968 --> 10:24.275
LEAVING ONLY HER HAND
EXPOSED TO TEMPORAL FLARE,

10:24.319 --> 10:28.628
THOUGH NOT FULLY, OR IT'D BE
FOSSILIZED LIKE THE TREES.

10:28.671 --> 10:31.935
I CAN HELP HER,

10:31.979 --> 10:35.417
NOT AT THE POINT
OF A GUN.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.812
OHH...AGH...

10:38.855 --> 10:40.335
GOOD CHOICE.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.511
THERE'S MEDICINE,
BUT TO GET IT,

10:42.554 --> 10:45.296
WE NEED TO GO BACK TO
THE PLACE WHERE IT HAPPENED.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.776
I'LL GIVE HER
3 HOURS TOPS.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.300
BEFORE THE TIME DILATION
REACHES HER BRAIN

10:49.344 --> 10:53.087
AND SHE'S DEAD.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.220
FINE, BUT THEN
YOU'RE TAKING ME

10:56.264 --> 10:58.266
TO THE OLD MAN,
OR YOU'RE DEAD.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.964
AH, SO YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR GABRIEL.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.705
WHAT DID RUSSELL
PROMISE YOU?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.272
40 VESTAL VIRGINS
AND A SIDE DISH

11:04.315 --> 11:08.798
OF NONE OF
YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

11:10.408 --> 11:14.412
YOU'RE NOT BORING.
I GIVE YOU THAT.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.332
CHANNEL
THE RADIATION

11:21.376 --> 11:22.899
THROUGH A SPATIAL
LIGHT MODULATOR

11:22.943 --> 11:24.248
WITH A CALCULATED
PHASE VARIATION.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.815
AND IT FOLLOWS A CURVED
TRAJECTORY IN FREE SPACE.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.077
COOL. GOT IT.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.383
WE JURY-RIG
THE SECURITY PYLONS

11:28.426 --> 11:29.863
ELIGIUS USED
FOR THE PRISONERS

11:29.906 --> 11:31.691
- TO HANDLE THE RADIATION.
- WE PROVIDE THE REACTOR FUEL.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.694
YEAH, OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF YOUR OWN HEARTS, I'M SURE.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.479
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.829
NO. I DID.

11:39.873 --> 11:43.137
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO GET SOME REST.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.834
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN?

11:44.878 --> 11:47.010
NO. YOU GO.
I DON'T NEED REST.

11:47.054 --> 11:49.186
I NEED TO GET THIS DONE
AS FAST AS I CAN

11:49.230 --> 11:52.712
SO WE CAN GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.109
YOU KNOW, AS SOMEONE
WHO'S LIVED WITH PAIN

11:59.153 --> 12:00.981
FOR LONGER THAN
I CAN REMEMBER,

12:01.024 --> 12:02.852
I CAN GET WANTING
A NEW BODY,

12:02.896 --> 12:04.549
JUST WOULDN'T MURDER
SOMEONE ELSE FOR IT.

12:04.593 --> 12:08.075
IT'S NOT MURDER.
WE DON'T FORCE PEOPLE.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.120
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT.

12:10.164 --> 12:13.733
YOU RAISE THEM FROM BIRTH
TO BELIEVE YOU'RE GODS

12:13.776 --> 12:16.126
SO THEY SACRIFICE
THEMSELVES WILLINGLY

12:16.170 --> 12:19.260
FOR THE GREATER
GLORY OF YOU.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.566
IT MUST BE NICE
TO BE WORSHIPPED.

12:21.610 --> 12:25.135
NO, NOT REALLY.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.969
THIS YOU
AND YOUR MOM?

12:33.013 --> 12:37.104
PRIYA, RIGHT?
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.323
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

12:39.367 --> 12:44.154
I'M SURE SHE'S WAY MORE
IMPORTANT THAN SOME BARMAID.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.810
OF COURSE, DELILAH WASN'T
JUST A BARMAID, WAS SHE?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.812
SHE WAS A DAUGHTER
AND A FRIEND.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.293
I WAS JUST A KID.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.340
RUSSELL KILLED US
IN THE FIRST RED SUN

12:56.384 --> 12:59.213
NOT LONG AFTER
THIS WAS TAKEN.

13:02.912 --> 13:06.133
I DIDN'T ASK
TO BE RESURRECTED.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.313
NO, BUT YOU'RE

13:12.356 --> 13:15.490
RYKER THE NINTH
NOW, THOUGH, RIGHT,

13:15.533 --> 13:16.708
8 BODIES?

13:16.752 --> 13:19.537
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN
YOU SNATCHED THIS ONE?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.285
206.

13:28.329 --> 13:31.158
I'LL LOOK AT
THAT REACTOR NOW.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.160
WOMAN: GUYS, NUMBER ONE
ON OUR LIST--

13:33.203 --> 13:34.814
RED SUN MUSHROOM
ELIGIUS PROTOCOL.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.860
MAN: OH, JOSEPHINE PRIME'S
FAVORITE RITUAL,

13:37.904 --> 13:39.166
REASON I MISS HER.

13:39.209 --> 13:43.344
BE RESPECTFUL. WE'RE STILL
IN THE OFFERING GROVE.

13:47.348 --> 13:51.613
WHO LEAVES TO SCOUT
WITHOUT A MAP?

14:06.019 --> 14:09.196
MERCY.

14:11.372 --> 14:14.549
I'LL GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.513
NNGH!

14:22.557 --> 14:27.954
PLEASE. MERCY.
THEY'RE INSIDE ME.

14:42.055 --> 14:45.928
STOP! UH! NO.

14:46.711 --> 14:50.498
YOU WERE IN THE TAVERN.
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

14:50.541 --> 14:53.370
JADE: I HAVE MY ORDERS.
LET'S GO.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.546
HE'S IN PAIN.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.113
NOT THAT IT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

14:57.157 --> 14:59.724
BUT HE
CHOSE THIS PATH.

14:59.768 --> 15:02.118
JADE...

15:05.252 --> 15:10.822
YOU'RE STRONG.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.476
JOIN ME.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.523
I WOULD, MY FRIEND,

15:15.566 --> 15:18.308
BUT I HAVE
ANOTHER CHARGE.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.223
YOU KNOW HIM?

15:20.267 --> 15:21.833
HE'S THE GUARD WHO
LOWERED THE SHIELD

15:21.877 --> 15:24.184
THAT LET YOUR SHIP IN
THE NIGHT THEY TOOK ROSE.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.534
HE BLAMES HIMSELF
FOR HER DEATH.

15:26.577 --> 15:29.276
HE SHOULD BLAME ME.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.756
NOW LET'S GO.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.238
- MERCY.
- I SAID NO! UH!

15:35.282 --> 15:38.285
- UH!
- UHH...

15:57.086 --> 16:01.786
HEY, SAVE YOUR ENERGY.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.006
YEAH? FOR WHAT,
ANOTHER WAR?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.573
IS THAT REALLY WHAT
CLARKE WOULD WANT?

16:05.616 --> 16:08.097
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
CLARKE WOULD WANT.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.186
IT'S TOO BAD
WE CAN'T ASK HER.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.101
WE KNOW SHE WANTED
TO DO BETTER.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.016
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK
RISKING ALL OF OUR LIVES

16:14.060 --> 16:17.715
FOR REVENGE IS A STEP
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.982
WHY AREN'T YOU
RESTRAINED LIKE ME?

16:23.025 --> 16:24.287
I DON'T KNOW.

16:24.331 --> 16:28.770
MAYBE I SEEM LESS LIKELY
TO RIP THEIR HEADS OFF.

16:31.816 --> 16:35.472
WHY ARE YOU REALLY
HERE, MURPHY?

16:37.909 --> 16:39.824
YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW?

16:39.868 --> 16:42.784
- YEAH.
- FINE.

16:43.306 --> 16:47.049
I'M HERE TO CONVINCE
YOU TO TAKE THE DEAL.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.833
THERE. I SAID IT.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.967
WHY AM I NOT
SURPRISED?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.404
WHAT DID YOU SEE
WHEN YOU DIED, MURPHY?

16:54.448 --> 16:56.667
AM I TRYING
TO SAVE MY OWN ASS?

16:56.711 --> 16:59.235
YEAH. I AM,
BUT I'M ALSO

16:59.279 --> 17:03.413
SAVING YOURS, JUST LIKE
I DID DURING THE RED SUN.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.374
BELLAMY, IF WE
TAKE THIS DEAL,

17:07.417 --> 17:08.940
WE GET EVERYTHING
WE WANT.

17:08.984 --> 17:11.682
WE GET TO LIVE.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.684
NOT CLARKE.

17:13.728 --> 17:16.122
WE CAN'T
BRING HER BACK.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.124
WE CAN MAKE SURE THE
REST OF US SURVIVE,

17:18.167 --> 17:20.082
STARTING WITH YOU.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.605
IF YOU DON'T
TAKE THIS DEAL,

17:21.649 --> 17:22.867
JOSEPHINE
WILL KILL YOU.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.957
- THEN LET HER TRY.
- OH, SO THAT'S IT, THEN?

17:26.001 --> 17:29.004
WE START ANOTHER WAR?
WE DESTROY ANOTHER PLANET?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.266
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

17:30.310 --> 17:31.702
IS THAT WHAT MONTY
WOULD HAVE WANTED?

17:31.746 --> 17:34.488
HEY, MONTY--
LISTEN TO ME.

17:34.531 --> 17:39.406
MONTY WOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOU.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.542
MAYBE HE WOULD BE,

17:45.586 --> 17:48.937
OR MAYBE HE'D SEE THAT
THIS IS HOW WE DO BETTER.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.774
HUH. GET OUT.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.957
DON'T WORRY.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.614
I'LL DO MY BEST TO MAKE SURE
THEY ONLY KILL YOU.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.229
DIYOZA: WAIT. TELL ME
IF I GOT THIS RIGHT.

18:20.273 --> 18:23.406
THE OLD MAN IS ACTUALLY
THE ORIGINAL GABRIEL,

18:23.450 --> 18:25.756
PRIME NUMBER 13, ONLY
HE LOST HIS STOMACH

18:25.800 --> 18:28.019
FOR IMMORTALITY, SO
HE BECAME A TERRORIST

18:28.063 --> 18:29.586
TO KILL
HIS OWN PEOPLE.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.894
HE'D CALL IT
A MORAL AWAKENING.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.548
DON'T WE ALL?

18:34.591 --> 18:36.941
SO YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR REDEMPTION--

18:36.985 --> 18:38.160
IS THAT IT?--

18:38.204 --> 18:40.423
BY HELPING RUSSELL
KILL GABRIEL.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.121
I CAN OFFER YOU
A BETTER WAY.

18:42.164 --> 18:46.125
NO. SCREW REDEMPTION.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.350
AH, I SEE.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.786
HEH. DID RUSSELL
TELL YOU

18:55.830 --> 18:58.180
THE CHILD WILL BE
CONSIDERED WORTHLESS?

18:58.224 --> 19:00.704
YOU DON'T HAVE THE BLOOD,
AND NEITHER WILL SHE.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.097
THEY'LL CALL HER A NULL.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.664
SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO BEAR CHILDREN.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.319
SHE'LL CLEAN TOILETS
OR VOLUNTEER TO DIE

19:06.362 --> 19:07.842
AS A GUARD OR
ATTEND TO THE DEAD.

19:07.885 --> 19:11.062
- AT LEAST SHE'LL BE ALIVE.
- IF YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.281
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.327
I'M NOT JOINING
YOUR LITTLE REBELLION.

19:14.370 --> 19:19.636
MY DAYS OF FIGHTING
FOR LOST CAUSES ARE OVER.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.943
REALLY?

19:21.986 --> 19:23.640
THEN EXPLAIN OCTAVIA.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.687
SHE'S AS LOST AS THEY
COME, YET YOU HELP HER.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.993
EASY.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.084
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

19:33.128 --> 19:35.435
I THINK YOU DON'T
WANT HER TO END UP

19:35.478 --> 19:39.221
ON THE SAME PAGE OF
YOUR HISTORY BOOKS AS YOU.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.614
YOU SEE A LOT.

19:45.532 --> 19:46.837
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

19:46.881 --> 19:49.579
THAT'S A QUESTION
FOR THE OLD MAN.

19:49.623 --> 19:53.583
MAYBE HE'LL ANSWER IT
BEFORE YOU KILL HIM.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.672
HERE IT COMES.

19:55.716 --> 19:59.110
TREE SAP? THAT'S
YOUR MIRACLE CURE?

19:59.154 --> 20:02.331
SO HELP ME GOD, IF
YOU'RE JUST BUYING TIME

20:02.375 --> 20:04.246
FOR YOUR FRIENDS
TO COME AND SAVE YOU--

20:04.290 --> 20:05.552
"BUYING TIME."

20:05.595 --> 20:08.729
INTERESTING
CHOICE OF WORDS.

20:08.772 --> 20:12.559
I PREFER TIME
IN A BOTTLE.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.498
MADI: AAH!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

20:38.541 --> 20:40.282
HEDA.

20:44.547 --> 20:48.421
I SEE THEM IN MIRRORS.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.598
SOON, THEY'LL BE
EVERYWHERE.

20:51.641 --> 20:55.254
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DO
THE SEPARATION RITUAL NOW.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.559
WHERE'S CLARKE?

20:56.603 --> 20:58.257
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TIME
TO WAIT ANYMORE, HEDA.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.910
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE
STRONG WITHOUT HER.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.434
NOW, I'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE,

21:01.477 --> 21:04.219
BUT, LUCKILY, RAVEN
KEPT TITUS' BOOK.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.178
IT CONTAINS THE WISDOM
OF BEKKA PRAMHEDA.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.702
THE RITUAL IS SIMPLE,

21:08.745 --> 21:11.792
BUT YOU'LL NEED TO FOCUS
LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

21:11.835 --> 21:12.923
YOU WON'T BE ALONE.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.577
ACCORDING TO THIS,
THERE'S A DREAM SPACE

21:14.621 --> 21:16.144
IN THE FLAME WHERE
YOU CAN SUMMON

21:16.187 --> 21:17.798
THE OTHER COMMANDERS
TO CONFRONT SHEIDHEDA,

21:17.841 --> 21:20.714
BUT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
YOU NEED TO HOLD ON

21:20.757 --> 21:23.543
TO A GOOD MEMORY,
LET IT BE LIKE A SHELTER

21:23.586 --> 21:25.936
THAT KEEPS YOU SAFE
IN A STORM.

21:25.980 --> 21:29.810
DO YOU HAVE
THAT MEMORY?

21:30.637 --> 21:32.813
THE DAY I MET CLARKE,

21:32.856 --> 21:35.642
BEFORE THE BEAR TRAP.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.948
PERFECT.

21:37.992 --> 21:41.778
NOW LEAN BACK.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

21:41.822 --> 21:46.000
CONCENTRATE AND
REPEAT AFTER ME.

23:10.258 --> 23:14.436
NO. YOU'RE A LIAR.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.931
HEDA?

23:31.497 --> 23:33.760
UH!

23:35.892 --> 23:37.764
WHAT IS THIS?
LET ME GO.

23:37.807 --> 23:41.115
WE'RE NOT THROUGH.
THE RITUAL TAKES REPETITION.

23:41.158 --> 23:44.945
THE RESTRAINT IS TO PROTECT YOU
IN CASE HE BREAKS THROUGH.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.513
LET'S START AGAIN.

23:47.556 --> 23:48.644
DOES CLARKE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

23:48.688 --> 23:53.693
CLARKE'S NOT HERE.
NOW SIT DOWN.

24:00.961 --> 24:06.445
WOMAN ON P.A.: SOUND MIND,
SOUND BODY, SOUND HEART.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.448
BLESSED BE THE PRIMES.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.938
ANY PROGRESS
ON THE KANE PROBLEM?

24:21.982 --> 24:23.592
"THE KANE PROBLEM"?

24:23.636 --> 24:25.986
IS THAT WHAT YOU
THINK THIS IS?

24:26.029 --> 24:29.163
NO. NO. THERE'S
NO PROGRESS.

24:29.206 --> 24:32.253
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.214
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

24:37.258 --> 24:40.000
THE PRIMES HAD A WAY
TO SAVE KANE...

24:40.043 --> 24:42.655
BUT TO DO IT,

24:42.698 --> 24:46.310
YOU'D HAVE TO TURN HIM
INTO A NIGHTBLOOD FIRST?

24:50.010 --> 24:51.185
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

24:51.228 --> 24:54.667
COME INSIDE,
AND I'LL SHOW YOU.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.889
THEY CALL IT
THE MIRACLE OF SANCTUM.

24:59.933 --> 25:00.977
ALL YOU NEED TO DO

25:01.021 --> 25:03.284
IS TEACH THEM HOW
TO MAKE NIGHTBLOOD,

25:03.327 --> 25:06.940
AND THEN THAT'S YOURS--
WELL, KANE'S, I MEAN.

25:06.983 --> 25:11.510
YOU MAKE HIM A NIGHTBLOOD,
YOU DOWNLOAD HIS MIND.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.555
THAT'S IT.
IT REALLY IS A MIRACLE.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.645
HIS MIND IS GONNA GO
IN ANOTHER PERSON'S BODY?

25:16.689 --> 25:19.518
BUT WE'VE DONE WORSE,
HAVEN'T WE--

25:19.561 --> 25:22.172
THE CULLING ON THE ARK,

25:22.216 --> 25:24.566
MOUNT WEATHER,
BECCA'S LAB.

25:24.610 --> 25:30.006
NO. WE DID THAT TO SURVIVE,
FOR ALL OF US TO SURVIVE.

25:30.050 --> 25:34.184
AND WE DID.
WE SURVIVED.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.970
NOW WE GET
OUR HUMANITY BACK.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.059
BY TAKING
INNOCENT LIVES?

25:39.102 --> 25:41.714
RUSSELL TOLD ME
THAT HIS PEOPLE

25:41.757 --> 25:43.803
WOULD VOLUNTEER
FOR THIS.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.631
IF THE PRIMES
CAN MAKE NIGHTBLOOD,

25:45.674 --> 25:47.850
THEN THEY CAN BRING BACK
ALL OF THEM AT ONCE.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.373
IT WOULD BE THE MOST
SPECTACULAR THING

25:49.417 --> 25:50.723
THAT'S EVER
HAPPENED HERE,

25:50.766 --> 25:51.985
AND PEOPLE WOULD
LOVE YOU FOR IT.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.770
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOU, CLARKE.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.207
I KNOW.

25:57.251 --> 26:02.082
I KNOW.
IT'S JUST...

26:03.823 --> 26:05.868
KANE SHOULD
BE HERE, MOM,

26:05.912 --> 26:08.044
MORE THAN THE REST
OF US COMBINED.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.525
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO BE THE GOOD GUYS,

26:10.569 --> 26:13.876
BUT HE'S JUST GOOD.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.881
YEAH.

26:19.665 --> 26:20.883
YES. HE IS.

26:20.927 --> 26:23.233
AND THIS ISN'T
JUST ABOUT YOU.

26:23.277 --> 26:25.148
WE NEED HIM
MORE THAN EVER.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.716
IF HE COULD NEGOTIATE
PEACE IN POLIS,

26:27.760 --> 26:30.893
THEN HE CAN SAVE US
HERE AND NOW.

26:31.285 --> 26:35.289
I WASN'T AWARE THAT
WE NEEDED SAVING.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.899
WE DON'T.

26:36.943 --> 26:40.250
IT'S JUST
A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

26:40.294 --> 26:43.384
LISTEN TO ME.

26:43.427 --> 26:44.777
MOM,

26:44.820 --> 26:49.433
I KNOW YOU BLAME YOURSELF
FOR DAD'S DEATH...

26:52.436 --> 26:55.309
AND I KNOW YOU BLAME
YOUR ADDICTION

26:55.352 --> 26:58.617
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
TO KANE.

26:59.530 --> 27:02.969
MOM, I'M AFRAID OF
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU

27:03.012 --> 27:05.972
IF WE LOSE HIM, TOO.

27:10.193 --> 27:13.022
I CAN'T LOSE YOU.

27:28.734 --> 27:32.215
OK. I'LL DO IT.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.355
THE LEES HAVE BEEN
PART OF OUR PRIME FAMILY

27:41.398 --> 27:43.400
FOR OVER 200 YEARS.

27:43.444 --> 27:47.187
HOW CAN WE JUST
ERASE THEM FOREVER?

27:47.230 --> 27:49.319
JOSEPHINE: WE DON'T
REALLY HAVE A CHOICE.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.494
I'VE DONE MY JOB.

27:50.538 --> 27:52.105
ABBY WILL SHOW US
HOW TO MAKE NIGHTBLOOD,

27:52.148 --> 27:54.324
BUT ONLY IF WE BRING
HER LOVER BACK.

27:54.368 --> 27:57.197
WHY COME TO ME,
AND NOT YOUR FATHER?

27:57.240 --> 27:59.808
DAD THINKS
WITH IS HEART--

27:59.852 --> 28:01.897
THIS BODY
IS PROOF OF THAT--

28:01.941 --> 28:03.682
BUT WE HAVE
TO BE PRACTICAL.

28:03.725 --> 28:04.987
WE HAVE ZERO HOSTS,

28:05.031 --> 28:06.989
SO WE EITHER DIE
IN THESE BODIES

28:07.033 --> 28:10.079
OR WE WIPE THE LEES
AND LIVE FOREVER.

28:10.123 --> 28:14.693
MOM, ONCE ABBY SHOWS YOU
HOW TO MAKE NIGHTBLOOD,

28:14.736 --> 28:17.304
WE'LL NEVER BE
ON ICE AGAIN.

28:17.347 --> 28:23.310
THE BEST PART--
NO MORE NULLS, NO OBLATION.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.225
ANYONE CAN BE A HOST.

28:25.268 --> 28:29.272
WE'LL HAVE THE GENETIC
PICK OF THE LITTER.

28:34.887 --> 28:37.890
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SACRIFICE.

29:00.042 --> 29:03.567
MIND TURNING THAT OFF?

29:05.395 --> 29:06.919
RYKER: HEY,
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.398
I'M TRYING TO WORK.
TURN IT OFF.

29:08.442 --> 29:11.619
MY SECOND HOST
BUILT THAT, ALEJO,

29:11.662 --> 29:14.665
MADE IT WHEN HE WAS 12
OUT OF RECYCLED RADIOS.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.277
AT LEAST THEY WERE STILL
GOOD FOR SOMETHING, HUH?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.758
AN OFFERING
TO THE GODS, HUH?

29:19.801 --> 29:21.455
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

29:21.498 --> 29:24.632
HOW DO YOU MAKE SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL SEEM SO PROFANE?

29:24.675 --> 29:26.416
NEWS FLASH--
KEEPING A GIFT

29:26.460 --> 29:28.723
FROM SOMEBODY
WHOSE BODY YOU STOLE

29:28.767 --> 29:30.638
IS PROFANE.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.118
HOW ABOUT THIS?

29:32.161 --> 29:33.467
THIS WAS GIVEN
TO MY SIXTH HOST,

29:33.510 --> 29:35.817
TYMAN AVERI, FROM
HIS MOTHER ANNABEL.

29:35.861 --> 29:39.603
EVERY MONTH, WE CELEBRATE
TY'S LIFE TOGETHER.

29:39.647 --> 29:40.996
IS THAT PROFANE?

29:41.040 --> 29:42.606
SO YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
THE PEOPLE WHO DIED FOR YOU.

29:42.650 --> 29:46.959
- I'M TOUCHED.
- I THINK ABOUT THEM EVERY DAY.

29:47.002 --> 29:50.571
EMORI: HEY,
ABBI NEEDS YOU.

29:50.614 --> 29:51.615
WHAT FOR?

29:51.659 --> 29:53.792
I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING ABOUT KANE.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.969
SHE NEEDS TO GET UP
TO THE MOTHERSHIP ASAP.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.798
I'LL RELIEVE
YOU HERE.

29:59.841 --> 30:03.279
HAVE A NICE FLIGHT.

30:03.889 --> 30:08.458
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

30:09.242 --> 30:12.506
IS THIS
YOUR LAST BODY?

30:15.683 --> 30:19.339
YEAH. DIDN'T THINK SO.

30:24.779 --> 30:28.609
MM...MM...

30:30.045 --> 30:33.396
WENT TO THE SPOT WE
CHOSE FOR OUR SETTLEMENT.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.573
BELLAMY WASN'T THERE.

30:36.617 --> 30:40.621
YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.323
AGH! UH!

30:47.367 --> 30:48.585
WHERE IS HE?

30:48.629 --> 30:51.980
PLEASE. CUT ME LOOSE.

30:52.024 --> 30:57.246
THE VINES, I CAN FEEL
THEM UNDER MY SKIN.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.466
WHO SENT YOU?

30:59.509 --> 31:03.035
YOU SAID YOU HAD
ANOTHER CHARGE.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.168
I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

31:06.212 --> 31:09.041
CLARKE SAID BELLAMY
WENT TO SCOUT.

31:09.084 --> 31:12.261
NO ONE KNEW I WAS
COMING OUT HERE

31:12.305 --> 31:14.873
EXCEPT FOR MY PEOPLE.

31:14.916 --> 31:20.052
THE PRIMES KNEW SHE
WAS A NIGHTBLOOD.

31:22.576 --> 31:25.231
OH, MY GOD...

31:26.145 --> 31:28.669
THAT'S NOT CLARKE.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.759
UH! NNGH...

31:31.802 --> 31:37.112
SHE'S A PRIME, AND
YOU'RE PROTECTING HER.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.941
I SWEAR ON
MY MOTHER'S SOUL,

31:39.985 --> 31:43.205
IF BELLAMY IS DEAD,

31:43.249 --> 31:47.209
I'LL SLIT YOUR
MASTER'S THROAT.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.733
HE'S NOT DEAD, OK?

31:49.777 --> 31:53.563
HE HAS UNTIL
SECOND MOON.

31:53.607 --> 31:57.828
THANK YOU FOR
BEING TRUTHFUL.

31:57.872 --> 32:02.529
I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU
IF I'M IN TIME.

32:17.805 --> 32:21.113
I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT, OK?

32:21.852 --> 32:23.593
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

32:23.637 --> 32:25.421
BECAUSE WE'RE
BOTH STRUGGLING

32:25.465 --> 32:28.555
TO LIVE WITH THIS,
AND I WAS HOPING

32:28.598 --> 32:34.735
MAYBE WE COULD HELP
EACH OTHER THROUGH IT.

32:34.778 --> 32:36.911
HEH.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.742
YOU WENT
TO MY FATHER?

32:41.785 --> 32:44.266
- I TAKE BIG SWINGS.
- HMM.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.486
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

32:46.529 --> 32:48.444
SAVING US.

32:48.488 --> 32:50.011
HE KNOWS
YOU KILLED CLARKE,

32:50.055 --> 32:51.708
AND, UNLIKE THE SNAKE
BEHIND YOU,

32:51.752 --> 32:53.928
HE WILL CRY
OVER SPILLED MILK.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.495
ENOUGH.

32:55.538 --> 32:58.280
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

32:58.324 --> 33:00.152
HAVE YOU BECOME SO
CALLOUS TO THE FEELINGS

33:00.195 --> 33:01.892
OF OTHERS THAT
YOU DON'T REMEMBER

33:01.936 --> 33:06.114
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LOSE
SOMEONE YOU LOVE?

33:08.116 --> 33:10.640
RUSSELL:
I KNOW YOU'RE IN PAIN.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.556
I KNOW YOU WANT REVENGE.
I WOULD, TOO.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.646
WE HAD A CHANCE TO BRING BACK
OUR DAUGHTER, AND WE TOOK IT.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.605
WE DIDN'T CONSIDER
THE CONSEQUENCES.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.520
- FOR GOD'S SAKE--
- BE QUIET.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.478
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
LET THE MAN SPEAK.

33:22.522 --> 33:26.265
- SHUT UP, MURPHY.
- SHUT UP, MURPHY.

33:27.788 --> 33:30.312
I THINK YOU
SHOULD HEAR HIM OUT.

33:30.356 --> 33:31.705
I THINK WE
CAN TRUST HIM.

33:31.748 --> 33:34.316
- DO YOU NOW?
- YOU CAN. LOOK.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.797
I CAN'T BRING
YOUR FRIEND BACK,

33:36.840 --> 33:40.018
BUT I CAN GUARANTEE SAFETY
FOR THE REST OF YOUR PEOPLE.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.845
WE'LL SHARE EVERYTHING
WE'VE LEARNED

33:41.889 --> 33:44.674
ABOUT SURVIVING
ON THIS MOON.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.850
WHY DID OUR SHIP
JUST TAKE OFF?

33:46.894 --> 33:48.722
ABBY'S SHOWING THEM
HOW TO MAKE NIGHTBLOOD.

33:48.765 --> 33:53.596
I TAKE IT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT HER DAUGHTER IS DEAD.

33:54.423 --> 33:57.339
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO KILL HER, TOO.

33:57.383 --> 34:00.081
YOU THINK MY NEED
FOR REVENGE IS STRONG?

34:00.125 --> 34:02.692
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
THIS ENDS.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.433
BELLAMY, STOP,
ALL RIGHT?

34:04.477 --> 34:07.045
YOU DON'T WANT THEM
TO KILL ALL OF US.

34:07.088 --> 34:09.090
JUST THINK.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.571
JOSEPHINE!

34:12.050 --> 34:13.138
- UH...
- AH!

34:13.181 --> 34:15.618
MURPHY: BELLAMY, COME ON.
DON'T DO THIS.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.055
UGH...

34:17.098 --> 34:19.231
JOSEPHINE: I'M SORRY, DADDY.
VIOLENCE IS ALL THEY KNOW.

34:19.274 --> 34:21.233
UGH...UGH...

34:21.276 --> 34:23.104
IF KILLING HIM
IS WHAT YOU NEED,

34:23.148 --> 34:28.675
THEN DO IT, BUT LET
THE VIOLENCE END HERE...

34:29.023 --> 34:31.112
AND EYE FOR AN EYE.

34:31.156 --> 34:34.115
AGH...UGH...

34:34.159 --> 34:35.595
AGH!

34:39.164 --> 34:41.688
BIG SWINGS.

34:55.615 --> 34:59.053
OCTAVIA: OHH...NNGH!

34:59.097 --> 35:00.750
UHH...

35:00.794 --> 35:03.840
SO WHAT'S
THE VERDICT?

35:03.884 --> 35:07.148
THE SPREADING
SEEMS TO HAVE SLOWED.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.803
THAT'S A GOOD
THING, RIGHT?

35:09.846 --> 35:12.980
IT'S BUYING YOU
SOME TIME.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.938
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:14.982 --> 35:17.158
IT SPED UP MY HEALING.
WHY IS IT SLOWING HERS?

35:17.202 --> 35:20.161
I SUPPOSED IT'S BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HEAL OLD AGE,

35:20.205 --> 35:22.468
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.861
HOW LONG
DO I HAVE?

35:24.905 --> 35:26.863
NOT LONG,

35:26.907 --> 35:29.431
A DAY, MAYBE TWO.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.607
YOU SAID IT
WOULD CURE HER.

35:31.651 --> 35:35.481
ACTUALLY,
I SAID IT MIGHT.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.701
CUT IT OFF.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.704
DIYOZA: BOLD MOVE.
WILL IT WORK?

35:41.748 --> 35:45.839
AND IF YOU SAY, "IT MIGHT,"
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM.

35:45.882 --> 35:51.279
HOLD ON.
YOUR ARM'S MOVEMENT.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.369
I--

35:54.413 --> 35:57.242
I WANT TO TRY
SOMETHING.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.550
HERE.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.944
LET IT SCRAPE
AGAINST THE BOULDER.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.207
DON'T TRY TO
CONTROL YOUR HAND.

36:06.251 --> 36:09.863
JUST LET IT MOVE.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

36:11.995 --> 36:14.128
NNGH! UH!

36:14.172 --> 36:17.958
UH! AHH...

36:26.184 --> 36:29.317
OCTAVIA: UHH...

36:29.361 --> 36:33.756
THAT'S ENOUGH.
TAKE A LOOK.

36:39.806 --> 36:42.069
A LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL,

36:42.112 --> 36:43.723
THE SHAPE
OF THE ANOMALY.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.507
IT'S THE SOURCE OF
THE TEMPORAL FLARES.

36:45.551 --> 36:49.729
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

36:49.772 --> 36:53.036
IT'S NOT
JUST A TREMOR.

36:53.080 --> 36:57.040
IT'S A MESSAGE.

36:57.084 --> 37:01.349
THE ANOMALY'S
CALLING YOU...

37:03.090 --> 37:06.702
JUST LIKE
IT CALLED ME.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.275
I GUESS WE BETTER
SEE WHAT THE HELL

37:14.319 --> 37:17.670
THIS ANOMALY WANTS.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.823
BELLAMY...

37:41.737 --> 37:44.392
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:46.351 --> 37:49.963
CLARKE'S DEAD.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.759
SO WHEN DO WE ATTACK?

38:03.803 --> 38:07.067
WE DON'T.

38:08.634 --> 38:11.027
WE DO WHAT CLARKE
WOULD HAVE DONE.

38:13.856 --> 38:16.772
WE SURVIVE.

38:26.869 --> 38:30.525
MADI, HEY...

38:33.659 --> 38:36.662
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.482
I'M SO SORRY,

39:14.526 --> 39:19.531
BUT TRAINING WILL HELP
YOU GET THROUGH THIS.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.925
HEDA?

39:28.888 --> 39:29.889
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

39:29.932 --> 39:33.022
- I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.
- "UPSET"?

39:33.066 --> 39:34.894
THEY KILLED HER,

39:34.937 --> 39:38.506
AND NOW BELLAMY SAYS
WE CAN'T GET REVENGE.

39:38.550 --> 39:41.901
I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU MIGHT WANT THAT,

39:41.944 --> 39:44.120
BUT IF REVENGE
LEADS TO WAR--

39:44.164 --> 39:47.559
NO MORE LESSONS.

39:53.391 --> 39:56.742
HEDA, WE CAN GET
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.573
NO.

40:02.617 --> 40:05.533
AS YOUR COMMANDER,
YOU ARE HEREBY BANISHED.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.795
HEDA, THINK.

40:06.839 --> 40:09.232
I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO OBEY YOUR COMMAND,

40:09.276 --> 40:10.973
AND YOU
NEED MY HELP NOW.

40:11.017 --> 40:13.628
I SAID GO...

40:13.672 --> 40:15.978
NOW...

40:16.022 --> 40:19.155
BEFORE I KILL YOU.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.649
SHUT UP.

41:17.823 --> 41:21.870

ABBY'S VOICE:
CLARKE, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.275
CLARKE: MOM?

41:35.318 --> 41:37.059
I'M SCARED.

41:37.103 --> 41:38.539
CLARKE...

41:38.583 --> 41:39.801
I'M AFRAID.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.847
YOU DON'T HAVE

41:41.890 --> 41:45.024
I WILL NOT LET YOU
DIE IN THIS WAR.

41:45.067 --> 41:47.287
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?

41:47.330 --> 41:50.029
WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK AT ALL.
