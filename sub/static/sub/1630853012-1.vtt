WEBVTT

00:37.130 --> 00:38.340
I'm hungry.

00:38.423 --> 00:40.800
A lady
never complains.

00:40.884 --> 00:42.677
We can't
eat dresses.

00:43.970 --> 00:46.723
If only the Duke
had sent bread.

00:46.806 --> 00:48.558
I think he wants
to marry you.

00:48.642 --> 00:50.268
I'd rather
marry you.

00:50.352 --> 00:51.937
He's a Duke.

00:52.020 --> 00:55.690
And you, my dear,
a rapidly ageing orphan.

00:55.774 --> 00:57.442
Ah, Marie!

00:57.526 --> 01:00.278
Well, I won't be rescued.
I'm not in distress.

01:00.362 --> 01:02.739
We have no money.
Not a bean.

01:02.822 --> 01:04.824
Your whole life,
our country has been at war...

01:04.908 --> 01:06.243
and everyone must make...
Everyone must make...

01:07.702 --> 01:10.080
I don't love
the Duke de Guiche.

01:10.163 --> 01:11.373
Wear the dress
he sent.

01:11.456 --> 01:15.085
No. Red is vulgar,
and it reeks of lechery.

01:15.168 --> 01:16.253
Have you seen my shoes?

01:16.336 --> 01:17.921
If you don't love him...
Or even like him.

01:18.004 --> 01:20.757
Why did you accept his
invitation to the theater?

01:20.840 --> 01:24.803
Because we can't afford the
tickets, and I want to see the play.

01:27.013 --> 01:28.723
 He's here.

01:29.307 --> 01:31.184
He's here.

01:31.268 --> 01:32.978
He's here.
Now, don't be rude to him.

01:33.061 --> 01:34.312
I'm not rude.

01:34.396 --> 01:37.315
I am enigmatically distant
and fashionably late.

01:37.399 --> 01:38.483
Where are my shoes?

01:38.567 --> 01:40.485
If you anger him,
he'll ruin us.

01:40.569 --> 01:42.404
Marry the Duke
and you'll be rich.

01:42.487 --> 01:44.322
A clever marriage
is your only option.

01:44.406 --> 01:46.283
I have no intention
of marrying anyone.

01:46.366 --> 01:48.952
Believe me,
spinsterhood is bleak.

01:49.035 --> 01:51.496
And love,
does that mean nothing to you?

01:51.580 --> 01:56.001
It might smell rosy for a year
or two, but love doesn't last.

01:56.084 --> 02:00.380
What lasts is compromise
and sacrifice.

02:01.214 --> 02:02.340
Children need love.

02:02.424 --> 02:03.758
Adults need money.

02:08.513 --> 02:09.514
Hello, Jacques.

02:09.598 --> 02:11.099
Marie. Marie.

02:11.182 --> 02:12.601
Tell your mistress she's two
months behind with the rent.

02:12.684 --> 02:13.977
It's coming, I promise.

02:14.060 --> 02:15.437
Two months!

02:16.938 --> 02:18.523
Marie!

02:22.235 --> 02:23.445
It's perfectly fetching.

02:23.528 --> 02:26.239
I just long to see you
in crimson silk.

02:26.323 --> 02:28.200
-I couldn't wear that dress.
-Oh?

02:28.283 --> 02:30.368
I don't have
the shoes to match. Sorry.

02:30.452 --> 02:33.330
Oh, I'll rectify
your errant shoelessness.

02:33.413 --> 02:36.625
Maybe the good Duke should've
send you the dress, Valvert.

02:36.708 --> 02:38.710
Oh, no, I tried it.

02:38.793 --> 02:40.795
It was too loose
on the bust.

02:42.255 --> 02:44.716
At least you have
more than one pair of shoes.

02:44.799 --> 02:47.886
<i>What does it feel like</i>

02:47.969 --> 02:50.972
<i>To slow dance in sunlight</i>

02:51.056 --> 02:54.976
<i>With someone you love?</i>

02:56.561 --> 02:59.814
<i>Somebody who sees you</i>

02:59.898 --> 03:02.817
<i>And won't ever leave you</i>

03:02.901 --> 03:08.657
<i>Alone</i>
<i>Whatever comes</i>

03:08.740 --> 03:11.493
<i>I need something</i>
<i>to die for</i>

03:11.576 --> 03:14.746
<i>Write poems and cry for</i>

03:14.829 --> 03:18.667
<i>And I won't be ashamed</i>

03:20.835 --> 03:23.505
<i>I'm nobody's pet</i>

03:23.588 --> 03:27.133
<i>No one's wife</i>
<i>no one's woman</i>

03:28.176 --> 03:30.679
<i>And I won't play that game</i>

03:30.762 --> 03:36.601
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say</i>

03:36.685 --> 03:40.146
<i>That they can't live</i>
<i>without me</i>

03:40.230 --> 03:42.482
<i>And they'll be there forever</i>

03:42.566 --> 03:48.613
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say to me</i>

03:48.697 --> 03:52.450
<i>That no matter</i>
<i>how bad it gets</i>

03:52.534 --> 03:56.705
<i>They won't turn away from me</i>

03:58.707 --> 04:01.167
<i>What do you do</i>

04:01.251 --> 04:04.296
<i>When you're</i>
<i>always waiting</i>

04:04.379 --> 04:07.883
<i>To find love</i>
<i>at first sight?</i>

04:10.719 --> 04:13.722
<i>If I'm naive</i>

04:13.805 --> 04:17.434
<i>Why does all the poetry</i>

04:18.267 --> 04:20.687
<i>Say that I might?</i>

04:22.731 --> 04:25.442
<i>I have heard</i>
<i>songs that say</i>

04:25.525 --> 04:28.528
<i>Love conquers everything</i>

04:28.612 --> 04:31.698
<i>However you name it</i>

04:34.534 --> 04:37.287
<i>It's right there</i>
<i>in front of you</i>

04:37.370 --> 04:40.498
<i>Wherever you are</i>

04:40.582 --> 04:43.376
<i>You just have to claim it</i>
<i>Claim it</i>

05:01.019 --> 05:02.103
Who's that?

05:02.187 --> 05:03.271
The Duke de Guiche.

05:03.355 --> 05:04.856
Second only
to the King.

05:04.940 --> 05:06.024
No, the lady.

05:06.107 --> 05:08.109
Oh, Roxanne.

05:08.193 --> 05:10.403
Well above your station,
my friend.

05:14.783 --> 05:17.160
Oh, what superb ribbons,
Duke de Guiche.

05:17.244 --> 05:19.496
Gorgeous piping.
And trim.

05:19.579 --> 05:20.956
Doeskin and
beaver, ladies.

05:21.039 --> 05:22.374
Doeskin and beaver.

05:25.794 --> 05:26.878
Yes, thank you.

05:26.962 --> 05:27.963
Stop there, sir.

05:30.674 --> 05:31.675
In you go, sir.

05:41.268 --> 05:42.310
...sir.

05:48.775 --> 05:50.902
Be swift,
be crafty...

05:50.986 --> 05:53.154
take from the women
and the men without swords.

05:53.238 --> 05:54.239
And children?

05:55.657 --> 05:57.826
A child
with a full purse is an adult.

05:57.909 --> 06:01.538
- <i>I'd give anything for</i>
-<i>someone to say</i>

06:01.621 --> 06:03.456
<i>For someone to say</i>

06:03.540 --> 06:07.002
<i>That they can't live</i>
<i>without me</i>

06:07.085 --> 06:09.546
<i>And they'll be there forever</i>

06:09.629 --> 06:15.385
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say to me</i>

06:15.468 --> 06:19.180
-<i>That no matter That no matter</i>
-<i>how bad it gets</i>

06:19.264 --> 06:22.893
<i>They won't</i>
<i>turn away from me</i>

06:25.187 --> 06:30.775
- <i>If love's there,
I'll feel</i> -<i>it and its stare</i>

06:30.859 --> 06:34.196
<i>It'll be freedom</i>
<i>at first sight</i>

06:34.279 --> 06:37.407
<i>I'll be walking on air</i>

06:37.490 --> 06:42.204
<i>If love's there</i>
<i>won't dare run away</i>

06:43.038 --> 06:46.708
<i>I'll swallow my pride</i>

06:47.375 --> 06:49.669
<i>And I'll ask</i>

06:51.379 --> 06:55.217
<i>You to stay</i>

07:15.237 --> 07:16.238
Thief!

07:18.490 --> 07:19.491
Hey!

07:20.075 --> 07:21.451
Stop that boy!

07:21.535 --> 07:23.912
Hey! Stop him!

07:28.875 --> 07:29.960
Play! Play! Play!

07:30.043 --> 07:31.086
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play!

07:31.169 --> 07:32.754
Play! Play! Play!

07:38.343 --> 07:39.636
Have you seen Cyrano?

07:39.719 --> 07:41.137
Not yet.

07:45.976 --> 07:48.520
Would you like an orange?
Yeah?

07:56.820 --> 08:00.115
Play! Play! Play!

08:00.198 --> 08:01.283
Theater.

08:01.366 --> 08:03.827
Inhale it, my boy.
Literally.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.537
Can you feel it? Yes?

08:05.620 --> 08:08.206
Tonight you will see
the magnificent Montfleury...

08:08.290 --> 08:10.709
the greatest actor
of his generation.

08:59.507 --> 09:00.800
Montfleury.

09:01.134 --> 09:02.135
Him?

09:07.432 --> 09:08.975
Montfleury!

09:09.059 --> 09:11.269
Bravo! Bravo!

09:15.649 --> 09:21.821
Happy is he who, far from court
and Society's sway...

09:21.905 --> 09:25.158
in isolation
self-imposed...

09:25.825 --> 09:27.452
shuns company.

09:27.536 --> 09:28.828
And who...

09:28.912 --> 09:32.916
when the soft wind
whistles wishingly...

09:32.999 --> 09:35.544
 Montfleury, what are you
doing here?

09:35.627 --> 09:36.711
Cyrano?

09:36.795 --> 09:38.004
Cyrano?
Yes.

09:38.088 --> 09:40.006
 After your performance
last week...

09:40.090 --> 09:43.552
I sent you a letter
urging you to retire.

09:43.635 --> 09:45.804
Cyrano.

09:45.887 --> 09:49.391
Happy is he who,
far from court and Society's...

09:49.474 --> 09:51.560
Did you receive my letter?

09:51.643 --> 09:55.105
Yes, I received
your letter, and I burnt it.

09:55.188 --> 09:57.816
I am
a professional actor.

09:57.899 --> 09:59.150
Yes, you are!
 Bravo!

09:59.234 --> 10:00.944
I've received
numerous prizes.

10:01.027 --> 10:02.195
He has.

10:02.279 --> 10:04.865
I have performed at court
for the King himself.

10:04.948 --> 10:05.949
Indeed, you have.
Yes!

10:06.032 --> 10:07.742
Yes.

10:07.826 --> 10:12.038
I have been successfully
entertaining the people for over three decades.

10:13.582 --> 10:17.043
And now I will act!

10:17.127 --> 10:18.295
Act! Act! Act!
Act! Act! Act!

10:18.378 --> 10:19.754
Act! Act! Act!

10:19.838 --> 10:20.881
Act!

10:21.673 --> 10:23.383
Happy he who shuns...

10:23.466 --> 10:25.218
Final warning!

10:25.302 --> 10:28.513
In insulting me,
you insult the dramatic muse.

10:28.597 --> 10:32.684
And worse, you...
you desecrate this theater...

10:32.767 --> 10:36.313
this crucible
of human...

10:37.397 --> 10:38.690
humanity.

10:38.773 --> 10:39.858
Hear, hear!

10:39.941 --> 10:42.986
This sacred wooden O.

10:43.069 --> 10:45.989
No, sir. Untrue.

10:46.072 --> 10:48.491
I'm sorry, but you lie.

10:50.869 --> 10:53.788
You've made this stage
your personal sty!

10:53.872 --> 10:56.249
The dramatic muse
has fled the building.

10:56.333 --> 10:59.628
She scampered off when you
started gilding the lily...

10:59.711 --> 11:02.672
with your great big voice.

11:08.053 --> 11:10.722
The poor muse
had no choice.

11:11.806 --> 11:15.185
I love this place
and all it means.

11:15.268 --> 11:18.230
Poetry, romance,
terror, truth.

11:18.313 --> 11:21.399
I've loved it here
since early youth.

11:21.483 --> 11:23.818
Can't stand aside
while you dishonor it...

11:23.902 --> 11:26.488
with your pumping and
your hideous jigs.

11:26.571 --> 11:28.448
I will not abide
your thumping...

11:28.532 --> 11:31.284
and, er, dreadful wigs.

11:33.328 --> 11:35.288
Montfleury, you've
abandoned the truth.

11:35.372 --> 11:36.748
You've lost your core.

11:36.831 --> 11:39.459
You don't remember how truth
feels or what it's for.

11:39.543 --> 11:42.462
So, now leave this stage,
never to return.

11:42.546 --> 11:46.299
And I'll applaud the new
integrity you'll earn.

11:46.383 --> 11:48.760
Exit, Montfleury.

11:54.224 --> 11:56.935
 I'm not moving one
step from the center of this stage.

11:57.018 --> 11:58.854
I am necessary.

11:58.937 --> 12:03.024
If you will not leave by
invitation, then I am compelled to use force.

12:05.026 --> 12:06.319
Help! Help me, someone!

12:06.403 --> 12:07.487
Protect me!

12:07.571 --> 12:09.030
Arrest him! Help!

12:09.114 --> 12:11.116
Please! Help me!

12:11.199 --> 12:14.286
-Please, Cyrano. Please. Will anyone here defend
-this great sausage?

12:17.622 --> 12:19.124
I will duel with any
volunteer...

12:19.207 --> 12:21.626
with all the honor commensurate
to his station.

12:21.710 --> 12:23.712
Is anyone
willing to fight for Montfleury?

12:23.795 --> 12:25.630
You are no Samson.

12:25.714 --> 12:28.884
I am no Goliath either, but I
fight like the two combined.

12:28.967 --> 12:30.135
I think not.

12:30.218 --> 12:32.429
Goliath was a giant.

12:32.512 --> 12:34.222
Care to think again?

12:35.390 --> 12:37.726
No volunteers?

12:37.809 --> 12:39.519
You came here to see
Montfleury...

12:39.603 --> 12:41.396
and yet you're
not willing to fight for him?

12:42.397 --> 12:44.024
Montfleury...
Sir, please.

12:44.107 --> 12:47.444
I will count to three, and you
will exit stage right hurriedly.

12:47.527 --> 12:48.612
 Please.

12:48.695 --> 12:50.322
One...
Do something.

12:50.405 --> 12:52.532
Two...
Think of the play.

12:52.616 --> 12:53.909
Three!

12:56.786 --> 12:58.788
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.

13:08.465 --> 13:11.384
Jodelet!
I came to see a play!

13:11.468 --> 13:13.178
 We paid
to see a play!

13:13.261 --> 13:16.348
And I have
saved you from seeing a fiasco!

13:16.431 --> 13:18.350
I paid
to see Montfleury!

13:18.433 --> 13:20.310
Yes, what
about their money?

13:20.393 --> 13:21.853
Always the money.

13:21.937 --> 13:22.938
Here.

13:25.649 --> 13:29.694
Oh, at this price, sir, you can
close the theaters every night.

13:29.778 --> 13:32.948
Ladies and gentlemen, you will
be refunded in full at the door.

13:33.031 --> 13:34.199
Dinner?

13:34.282 --> 13:36.660
Oh, I'd love to.
But no money.

13:36.743 --> 13:38.245
You had
a full bag of coins.

13:38.328 --> 13:40.956
All donated to the
long-suffering patrons of this theater.

13:41.039 --> 13:43.041
-How will you eat? The gesture is more
-than the meal.

13:43.124 --> 13:44.376
 You.

13:46.044 --> 13:48.255
You're a freak.

13:50.006 --> 13:52.509
The insult is antique,
but I accept it.

13:54.970 --> 13:56.137
Freak.

13:58.056 --> 13:59.391
Is that it?

13:59.474 --> 14:02.227
Have you exhausted your
dictionary of scorn?

14:02.310 --> 14:05.063
Who is this savage who dares to
present himself in public...

14:05.146 --> 14:08.900
without ribbons,
bows or braids?

14:10.402 --> 14:12.237
I am not au courant,
it's true.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.157
But think of my deeds as my
ribbons, my humor as a bow.

14:16.241 --> 14:18.994
Oh, do pipe down,
or else you'll drown.

14:19.661 --> 14:20.996
In verbosity.

14:21.079 --> 14:23.164
A fellow poet.

14:23.248 --> 14:25.834
Pleasure to meet you.
Cyrano de Bergerac.

14:47.856 --> 14:50.108
I accept your challenge.

14:50.192 --> 14:52.485
I'll make
short work of this.

14:55.113 --> 14:56.948
Isn't he a hoot?

15:01.870 --> 15:03.288
A palpable miss.

15:03.371 --> 15:05.624
It's hard to
hit a target quite so small.

15:05.707 --> 15:07.751
The man is
barely four feet tall.

15:10.378 --> 15:13.465
-<i>Sir, when I was born</i>
<i>The nurses laughed</i> -<i>hysterically</i>

15:13.548 --> 15:16.509
<i>They'd never seen anything</i>
<i>quite like me, apparently</i>

15:16.593 --> 15:19.596
<i>I'll never forget it</i>
<i>I can still hear them joking</i>

15:19.679 --> 15:22.891
<i>One said, "My goodness,</i>
<i>what has God been smoking?"</i>

15:22.974 --> 15:26.144
<i>From when I was born</i>
<i>I learned to control my tears</i>

15:26.228 --> 15:30.023
<i>When they carried me home</i>
<i>through town I left a trail of broken mirrors</i>

15:30.106 --> 15:32.150
<i>Yes, when children see me</i>
<i>They scream and run away</i>

15:32.234 --> 15:35.820
-<i>You're absolutely
right Halloween's my favorite</i> -<i>holiday</i>

15:35.904 --> 15:37.489
<i>I am a monster</i>
<i>I am a mutant</i>

15:37.572 --> 15:39.032
<i>A freak of nature</i>

15:39.115 --> 15:42.536
<i>I've heard all the hateful</i>
<i>ugly nomenclature</i>

15:42.619 --> 15:44.829
<i>Can't you see</i>

15:44.913 --> 15:48.166
<i>I'm much more</i>
<i>than you think</i>

15:49.584 --> 15:53.171
<i>I've heard it all</i>
<i>so many times</i>

15:53.797 --> 15:55.340
You are a disgrace!

15:55.423 --> 15:59.970
<i>Everybody knows</i>
<i>I'm so much more than a freak</i>

16:00.053 --> 16:03.515
<i>If you wanna try to hurt me</i>

16:03.598 --> 16:07.018
<i>You better get in line</i>

16:07.102 --> 16:08.728
<i>You just have to say it</i>
<i>Can't you see</i>

16:08.812 --> 16:10.647
<i>I get it, it makes sense</i>

16:10.730 --> 16:12.023
-<i>He's much more than you
think When you have</i> -<i>your kind of talent</i>

16:12.107 --> 16:13.483
<i>For clever vicious comments</i>

16:13.567 --> 16:15.110
<i>My heart's not even angry</i>
<i>He's heard it all</i>

16:15.193 --> 16:16.695
<i>It's just the way it breaks</i>
<i>So many times</i>

16:16.778 --> 16:18.530
<i>And don't be</i>
<i>so tough on God</i>

16:18.613 --> 16:20.532
<i>Everybody makes mistakes</i>

16:20.615 --> 16:22.367
-<i>Yes, one sight of me
could make a statue cry</i> -<i>Everybody knows</i>

16:22.450 --> 16:23.743
<i>He's so much more</i>
<i>Guess what else</i>

16:23.827 --> 16:24.870
<i>When bluebirds land on me</i>
<i>Than a freak</i>

16:24.953 --> 16:26.371
<i>They shit themselves</i>
<i>and die</i>

16:26.454 --> 16:27.747
<i>If you wanna try</i>
<i>Whichever way I look at you</i>

16:27.831 --> 16:29.833
<i>To hurt him</i>
<i>Can't find a tasteful side</i>

16:29.916 --> 16:30.959
-<i>A specimen like you</i>
<i>belongs in formaldehyde</i> -<i>You better get in line</i>

16:32.836 --> 16:34.212
<i>Yes, what you've heard</i>
<i>is true</i>

16:34.296 --> 16:35.797
<i>I am not a rumor</i>

16:35.881 --> 16:39.467
<i>I'm living proof that</i>
<i>God has a sick sense of humor</i>

16:49.769 --> 16:52.105
Cyrano! Cyrano! Cyrano!

16:52.189 --> 16:53.231
Shh!

16:56.234 --> 16:57.235
Cyrano!

17:24.137 --> 17:27.057
Yes. It all goes in.

17:29.226 --> 17:31.061
And God, how it hurts.

17:44.449 --> 17:47.077
He went too far.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.747
Valvert insulted him, and then
challenged him to a duel.

17:50.830 --> 17:53.833
Valvert is a Comte,
and in my retinue.

17:55.377 --> 17:58.964
 I guarantee you
Cyrano took no pleasure from it.

17:59.047 --> 18:00.465
You know him?

18:00.549 --> 18:01.841
They're from
the same town...

18:01.925 --> 18:04.010
-in the south west. Cyrano is
-my oldest friend.

18:04.094 --> 18:08.098
It would be to your advantage
to end the friendship.

18:10.267 --> 18:13.812
Roxanne,
I won't wait forever.

18:17.107 --> 18:18.942
Did I miss a proposal?

18:19.025 --> 18:21.486
Oh, don't push your luck,
pretty thing.

18:21.570 --> 18:23.113
Don't do that.

18:27.284 --> 18:29.494
How about
a drinking song?

18:29.578 --> 18:31.204
Like soldiers do.

18:31.288 --> 18:32.497
We're better
than that.

18:32.581 --> 18:33.748
At least, I am.

18:34.749 --> 18:36.126
May I ask you
a question?

18:37.127 --> 18:38.211
Anything.

18:38.295 --> 18:39.504
It's a little
personal.

18:40.463 --> 18:42.257
I have no secrets
from you.

18:45.135 --> 18:46.261
Are you in love?

18:47.762 --> 18:49.431
Whatever gave you
that idea?

18:49.514 --> 18:50.765
See, I knew
you wouldn't like it.

18:50.849 --> 18:51.933
Do I seem offended?

18:52.017 --> 18:53.977
No. But your
guard is up.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.563
It's just some things
are private.

18:58.940 --> 19:02.152
What gave me
that idea...

19:02.235 --> 19:04.487
was your performance
at the theater today.

19:06.489 --> 19:09.784
I sensed you were playing to one
particular member of the audience.

19:09.868 --> 19:11.077
Oh, who?

19:11.161 --> 19:13.079
Let's not continue
this charade.

19:13.163 --> 19:14.623
If you want
to unburden, fine.

19:14.706 --> 19:16.708
If you don't,
that's fine, too.

19:20.170 --> 19:21.171
Yes.

19:23.298 --> 19:24.299
Yes.

19:25.467 --> 19:26.635
Yes.

19:30.055 --> 19:31.514
I am in love.

19:35.977 --> 19:37.187
I dare.

19:40.815 --> 19:43.902
My sole purpose on this Earth
is to love Roxanne.

19:54.329 --> 19:55.539
Do you feel better now?

19:56.373 --> 19:57.832
Do you?

19:59.292 --> 20:03.755
<i>Have you ever wanted</i>
<i>something</i>

20:05.090 --> 20:08.176
<i>So badly</i>
<i>you cannot breathe</i>

20:10.470 --> 20:14.558
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>loved someone</i>

20:17.102 --> 20:19.187
<i>Madly</i>

20:20.522 --> 20:22.732
No, I don't think
I have.

20:23.733 --> 20:25.694
Isn't she magnificent?

20:25.777 --> 20:27.946
She is,
though perhaps a little vain.

20:28.029 --> 20:29.614
Yes, but
magnificently so.

20:29.698 --> 20:31.616
There's some pretension
in there, too.

20:32.325 --> 20:33.785
She's full of it.

20:33.869 --> 20:35.495
I wasn't sure about
her hair today.

20:35.579 --> 20:36.705
Agreed.

20:36.788 --> 20:40.959
But even
her imperfections are perfect.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.592
In our little town,
back in the day...

20:49.801 --> 20:53.221
she was practically
worshipped.

20:56.391 --> 20:59.477
To some
she was notorious.

20:59.561 --> 21:02.314
To me, glorious.

21:02.397 --> 21:03.648
Does she know?

21:03.732 --> 21:05.192
Do you think a person
of her beauty...

21:05.275 --> 21:08.111
in mind, body, and soul
doesn't know about it?

21:08.195 --> 21:10.906
I mean, does she know
that you're in love with her?

21:10.989 --> 21:11.990
No.

21:12.073 --> 21:14.117
No.

21:14.201 --> 21:16.745
No. Someone like me
supposing to love perfection?

21:16.828 --> 21:18.079
No. If I confessed...

21:18.914 --> 21:20.123
she'd never see me again.

21:20.207 --> 21:22.000
You don't have
a very high opinion of her.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.501
What? She's the Alps.

21:23.585 --> 21:25.921
No, but you don't think
she has the depth...

21:26.004 --> 21:27.172
to look beyond your...
Careful.

21:27.255 --> 21:28.548
...unique physique.
Not bad.

21:28.632 --> 21:30.008
Thank you.

21:30.091 --> 21:31.551
To love you for who you are
and not for how you look.

21:31.635 --> 21:32.928
Yes, but
don't you see?

21:33.011 --> 21:35.096
I am simply
not worthy of her.

21:36.556 --> 21:41.019
<i>I've held my breath</i>
<i>since I saw her</i>

21:41.102 --> 21:43.104
<i>I've tried to look away</i>
<i>but I can't resist</i>

21:47.859 --> 21:52.781
<i>I know</i>
<i>every detail of her</i>

21:52.864 --> 21:54.658
<i>I made a list</i>

21:58.036 --> 22:00.580
<i>I can't tell you how long</i>

22:00.664 --> 22:03.708
<i>I've thought about her</i>

22:03.792 --> 22:07.504
<i>I've kept everything</i>
<i>she's missed</i>

22:09.047 --> 22:11.883
<i>She's gonna</i>
<i>laugh at the one</i>

22:11.967 --> 22:16.888
<i>That brings her love</i>
<i>like this</i>

22:20.684 --> 22:25.438
<i>Have you ever wanted</i>
<i>something</i>

22:26.690 --> 22:30.861
<i>So badly</i>
<i>you cannot breathe</i>

22:31.987 --> 22:36.157
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>loved someone</i>

22:38.034 --> 22:40.161
<i>Madly</i>

22:40.245 --> 22:44.165
When you were fighting Valvert,
she was anxious.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.918
Oh, she turned
quite pale.

22:47.002 --> 22:49.170
Her lips trembled.

22:49.254 --> 22:50.589
They parted.

22:50.672 --> 22:51.715
She touched
her heart.

22:52.632 --> 22:53.925
You should tell her.

22:54.009 --> 22:55.093
You love her.

22:55.176 --> 22:58.179
No. My fate
is to love her from afar.

22:59.556 --> 23:01.808
To confess is to shatter
the beautiful dream.

23:01.892 --> 23:03.560
You forget,
I've seen you in battle.

23:03.643 --> 23:04.978
You're a fighter
to the end.

23:05.061 --> 23:06.938
But in love you've raised
the white flag.

23:07.022 --> 23:08.940
Have faith in her.
Tell her the truth.

23:09.024 --> 23:10.025
A word.

23:12.736 --> 23:15.113
Roxanne wishes to meet
with you alone.

23:15.197 --> 23:16.198
What?

23:16.281 --> 23:17.574
Why?

23:17.657 --> 23:19.659
She won't say,
no matter how much I berate her.

23:19.743 --> 23:20.785
But she says
it's urgent.

23:20.869 --> 23:21.953
Take me to her at once.

23:22.037 --> 23:23.955
Not now,
you vulgar person. At night?

23:24.748 --> 23:26.291
Then when?

23:26.374 --> 23:28.043
She'll go to early Mass
tomorrow.

23:28.126 --> 23:30.378
After she leaves the church,
she'll meet with you.

23:30.462 --> 23:33.798
Somewhere discreet,
she said it must be private.

23:33.882 --> 23:37.135
I'll thank you, Captain Le Bret,
to lower that eyebrow.

23:37.219 --> 23:39.012
There is nothing
unseemly here.

23:39.095 --> 23:41.223
I bow to your expertise
in the matter.

23:42.140 --> 23:43.725
A venue, please.

23:47.062 --> 23:49.397
I've never seen him silent
before, it's quite appealing.

23:49.940 --> 23:51.066
Let me think.

23:51.149 --> 23:52.484
Where?
I'm thinking where.

23:52.567 --> 23:54.236
Where?
Ragueneau's.

23:54.319 --> 23:55.695
Seven o'clock.
She'll be there.

23:55.779 --> 23:56.780
I will, too.

23:57.322 --> 23:58.323
And so will I.

23:58.406 --> 23:59.407
Good night.

24:03.912 --> 24:05.247
She wants to
see me privately.

24:05.330 --> 24:06.456
There it is.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.541
Alone.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.794
Oh, no.
I cannot succumb to hope!

24:10.877 --> 24:12.337
Hope is madness.
Hope is hell.

24:12.420 --> 24:13.505
Hope is life!

24:13.588 --> 24:15.549
Oh, I need an army
to vanquish!

24:15.632 --> 24:17.509
I have ten hearts,
I have twenty arms.

24:17.592 --> 24:19.427
I could kill
a hundred men.

24:19.511 --> 24:20.804
Good night, my friend.

24:20.887 --> 24:22.347
And good luck tomorrow.

24:22.430 --> 24:24.724
This could be it.

24:24.808 --> 24:26.268
Oh, have faith.

24:27.435 --> 24:28.895
Where are you off to,
this late hour?

24:28.979 --> 24:30.897
Some things
are private.

24:30.981 --> 24:32.607
Thank you for dinner.

24:34.818 --> 24:39.447
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>loved someone</i>

24:39.531 --> 24:41.908
<i>Madly</i>

25:02.470 --> 25:05.390
Well, I'd hoped
to fight 100, but ten will do.

26:39.234 --> 26:40.318
Morning, Ragueneau.

26:40.402 --> 26:41.653
Cyrano! Just the man!

26:41.736 --> 26:42.821
What time is it?

26:42.904 --> 26:43.989
Almost 6:00.

26:44.072 --> 26:46.116
I'm up with the muse,
so to speak.

26:46.199 --> 26:49.327
A poem.
Her soul eludes me.

26:49.411 --> 26:51.413
Needs your expert ear.

26:51.496 --> 26:54.332
I'm told you have
a private room.

26:54.416 --> 26:57.043
I mean, a room where two people
can have some privacy.

26:57.127 --> 26:58.420
Bit early
for an assignation.

26:58.503 --> 27:01.172
I mean talk privately
without interruption.

27:01.256 --> 27:02.424
I'll show you.

27:02.507 --> 27:05.135
Simultaneously,
I'll recite what I have so far.

27:05.218 --> 27:08.680
The poem is entitled
"Constellation."

27:08.763 --> 27:09.806
Good, eh?

27:09.890 --> 27:10.891
Terrific.

27:17.063 --> 27:18.440
Dear Roxanne.

27:20.317 --> 27:21.610
Dear Roxanne.

27:26.448 --> 27:32.078
<i>Every morning</i>
<i>at the break of light</i>

27:32.162 --> 27:36.625
<i>I see you standing</i>
<i>in the sun</i>

27:37.918 --> 27:44.257
<i>You look at me with</i>
<i>the kindest eyes</i>

27:44.341 --> 27:48.428
<i>Every morning</i>
<i>I'm overcome</i>

27:48.511 --> 27:51.097
"My heavenly earthly desire."

27:52.807 --> 27:54.601
Heavenly earthly, eh?

27:54.684 --> 27:55.685
How's this?

27:57.896 --> 27:59.648
Something more private?

27:59.731 --> 28:01.733
I understand.
Discretion.

28:01.816 --> 28:03.360
Now...

28:03.443 --> 28:07.822
"Jupiter and Pluto are planets,
revolving like us, far apart."

28:07.906 --> 28:13.912
<i>Sorrow and glory and</i>
<i>blinding euphoria</i>

28:13.995 --> 28:17.999
<i>Everything's there</i>
<i>in your name</i>

28:18.083 --> 28:21.169
"May I woo you
with my art."

28:23.088 --> 28:24.923
Good.
That's it thus far.

28:25.006 --> 28:27.092
There's a long way to go,
but be brutal.

28:27.175 --> 28:29.386
Do you think the planetary
metaphor holds?

28:34.683 --> 28:36.434
Perhaps consider sublimation.

28:36.518 --> 28:37.519
Right.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.896
A different pattern
of imagery.

28:39.980 --> 28:41.857
Maybe something
you know intimately.

28:43.233 --> 28:45.026
Anything in mind?

28:45.735 --> 28:47.279
 <i>Baking?</i>

28:47.362 --> 28:51.783
Sensuality and longing expressed
through the act of baking.

28:51.867 --> 28:52.951
<i>Why not?</i>

28:53.034 --> 28:54.619
<i>Rising dough.</i>

28:54.703 --> 28:57.038
<i>Flour. Ovens.</i>

28:57.122 --> 28:58.164
<i>Heat.</i>

28:58.248 --> 28:59.791
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

29:00.417 --> 29:01.418
Thank you!

29:05.380 --> 29:06.590
Thank you!

29:10.135 --> 29:15.724
<i>In darkness when</i>
<i>I close my eyes</i>

29:15.807 --> 29:19.769
<i>I see your hair come undone</i>

29:21.563 --> 29:27.694
<i>I lose myself every time</i>

29:27.777 --> 29:31.615
<i>Even now I'm overcome</i>

29:33.450 --> 29:39.748
<i>Roxanne, what am I</i>
<i>supposed to say?</i>

29:39.831 --> 29:44.836
<i>Words are only</i>
<i>glass on a string</i>

29:44.920 --> 29:47.714
<i>The more I arrange them</i>

29:47.797 --> 29:51.343
<i>And line up</i>
<i>and change them</i>

29:51.426 --> 29:55.263
<i>The more they mean</i>
<i>the same thing</i>

29:57.641 --> 29:59.184
<i>Roxanne</i>

30:00.560 --> 30:02.103
<i>Roxanne</i>

30:03.605 --> 30:05.440
<i>Roxanne</i>

30:09.444 --> 30:10.862
Roxanne!

30:10.946 --> 30:12.239
Roxanne.

30:19.955 --> 30:21.289
Do you like
rabbit stew?

30:21.373 --> 30:22.874
I loathe rabbits.

30:22.958 --> 30:25.043
I hate their taste, and I hate
the way they savage a garden.

30:25.126 --> 30:26.211
Shank of lamb?

30:26.294 --> 30:27.546
She likes tongue.

30:29.589 --> 30:31.883
For heaven's sake,
Marie.

30:31.967 --> 30:33.426
Go and eat.

30:33.510 --> 30:34.761
 Fine.

30:34.844 --> 30:37.138
And I'll pray
for your sins while I do.

30:39.808 --> 30:41.935
A huge slab of tongue.
Keep it coming.

30:42.018 --> 30:43.311
Righto.

30:46.064 --> 30:49.025
I have a confession
to make.

30:51.820 --> 30:53.446
Shall we sit?

30:53.530 --> 30:54.614
You're wounded.

30:54.698 --> 30:55.699
A scratch.

30:56.825 --> 30:58.410
I know your shoddy work.

30:58.493 --> 31:00.620
The dressing is loose.

31:00.704 --> 31:01.955
Your confession?

31:02.038 --> 31:03.206
Can wait a moment.

31:03.290 --> 31:04.624
It's only a scratch.

31:04.708 --> 31:08.086
It's a wound,
and it needs cleaning.

31:08.169 --> 31:10.547
I've been wounded
many times.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.424
This is not a wound.

31:12.507 --> 31:14.593
Then we'll call it
a cut.

31:14.676 --> 31:15.927
"Scratch" is
more accurate.

31:16.011 --> 31:18.096
I dispute "more."

31:18.179 --> 31:20.348
A thing is either accurate
or it isn't.

31:21.892 --> 31:23.518
There are no degrees
of accuracy.

31:24.352 --> 31:25.937
You taught me that.

31:26.021 --> 31:27.397
As you wish.

31:27.480 --> 31:28.899
I'll settle
for "cut."

31:29.733 --> 31:31.526
A deep one.

31:35.572 --> 31:36.781
How did you get it?

31:36.865 --> 31:38.617
Last night.
A duel.

31:38.700 --> 31:39.826
And look what happens.

31:39.910 --> 31:41.286
You should see
the other guys.

31:41.369 --> 31:42.662
I'm not impressed
by your swordsmanship.

31:42.746 --> 31:43.914
Oh, I know.

31:43.997 --> 31:46.958
Or rather,
I know you pretend you're not.

31:47.042 --> 31:49.294
I'd be very angry with you
if you died.

31:49.377 --> 31:50.420
Only angry?

31:50.503 --> 31:52.047
Incandescent.

31:52.130 --> 31:53.465
This might hurt.

31:56.051 --> 31:57.302
So brave.

31:59.137 --> 32:00.972
Will you make
your confession?

32:01.056 --> 32:02.265
Yes, I must.

32:02.349 --> 32:04.935
And there's only so much tongue
Marie can chew on.

32:14.778 --> 32:16.321
I feel shy.

32:23.328 --> 32:24.496
Never mind.

32:28.083 --> 32:30.335
Yesterday,
at the theater...

32:30.418 --> 32:31.419
Yes?

32:32.420 --> 32:35.549
I can barely believe
I'm saying this.

32:35.632 --> 32:40.595
I realized,
or became aware, suddenly...

32:41.805 --> 32:43.348
that I was in love.

32:43.431 --> 32:44.808
I see.

32:44.891 --> 32:47.894
I am madly in love, but the man
in question has no idea.

32:47.978 --> 32:49.729
And I don't know
how to tell him.

32:49.813 --> 32:51.606
Perhaps he
feels the same?

32:51.690 --> 32:53.525
It's possible.
I have hopes.

32:53.608 --> 32:55.360
How do you know
you love him?

32:55.443 --> 32:57.737
Because it's as if
I've always known.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.031
Always known him.

33:00.115 --> 33:01.700
He was always there...

33:01.783 --> 33:03.493
but this intense romantic
connection had not yet manifested.

33:03.577 --> 33:05.662
I understand.

33:05.745 --> 33:07.038
Supposing it's
all a delusion?

33:07.122 --> 33:08.373
No, you're
clearly in love.

33:08.456 --> 33:09.749
My mind is racing.
I'm feverish.

33:09.833 --> 33:10.876
-Would you like some water?
-No.

33:10.959 --> 33:12.252
It's got your
blood in it.

33:12.335 --> 33:13.920
-You were saying? I don't know what
-I was saying.

33:14.004 --> 33:16.214
Tell me about him. It might
reassure you there's no delusion.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.382
Yes.

33:18.466 --> 33:19.467
Good.

33:21.344 --> 33:24.472
I feel
he is rather proud.

33:29.311 --> 33:31.396
And very charming.

33:31.479 --> 33:35.775
He is mysterious,
but not obscure.

33:35.859 --> 33:39.237
And his face
is so bright with intelligence.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.322
What else?

33:42.949 --> 33:45.410
He's very beautiful,
obviously.

33:45.493 --> 33:47.162
Is he?

33:47.245 --> 33:49.915
Yes. But his natural modesty
means he's completely unaware of it.

33:49.998 --> 33:51.333
I've met people
like that.

33:51.416 --> 33:52.584
They are so rare.
Yes.

33:52.667 --> 33:54.544
Perhaps I could make
a confession, too?

33:54.628 --> 33:55.962
Yes, but I haven't
made mine yet.

33:56.046 --> 33:57.547
I'm sorry.
Please continue.

33:57.631 --> 33:58.882
This man I love
is a guard.

33:58.965 --> 34:00.050
In your regiment.

34:00.133 --> 34:01.551
Of course he is.
Of course?

34:01.635 --> 34:02.719
In the sense that...

34:02.802 --> 34:05.430
I interrupted.
Please continue.

34:05.513 --> 34:09.266
It's embarrassing to admit, but
I've never actually spoken to him.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.811
Of your love?
Of anything.

34:11.895 --> 34:13.271
It was
love at first sight.

34:13.355 --> 34:14.981
A thunderbolt.
It's madness.

34:15.065 --> 34:16.149
Fantastical.

34:16.233 --> 34:18.902
And yet
it's absolutely...

34:20.195 --> 34:21.196
real.

34:30.996 --> 34:32.165
Cyrano?
Here.

34:32.248 --> 34:34.376
-You seem... Just the wound
-playing up.

34:35.418 --> 34:36.545
Poor you.

34:37.712 --> 34:39.380
I have some ointment
at home.

34:44.719 --> 34:49.014
Supposing he's
an idiot.

34:49.099 --> 34:52.811
He might just be
an incredibly beautiful man...

34:52.893 --> 34:54.563
with the mind
of a rabbit.

34:57.399 --> 34:58.400
Except he isn't.

35:00.443 --> 35:01.903
He can't be.

35:02.904 --> 35:04.489
I need him
not to be.

35:08.743 --> 35:12.789
Anyway, I've made
some discreet inquiries...

35:12.873 --> 35:15.333
and I am told that
he is Christian.

35:15.417 --> 35:16.501
Christian Neuvillette.

35:16.585 --> 35:18.503
"Neuvillette"?
Never heard of him.

35:18.587 --> 35:20.297
He's a new recruit.

35:20.922 --> 35:22.299
He starts today.

35:26.761 --> 35:28.054
To the point.

35:29.306 --> 35:30.765
To your presence
here...

35:33.143 --> 35:35.395
I know how the guards treat
the new recruits...

35:35.478 --> 35:38.231
your ancient
initiation rituals and so on.

35:38.315 --> 35:40.525
So, please,
will you protect him?

35:40.609 --> 35:42.360
I can refuse you nothing.

35:42.444 --> 35:43.820
And never let him
fight a duel?

35:43.904 --> 35:44.988
No.

35:45.071 --> 35:46.364
And guard his life
with your own?

35:46.448 --> 35:47.532
Yes.

35:47.616 --> 35:49.075
And be his friend?

35:49.159 --> 35:50.952
I might not like him.

35:51.036 --> 35:53.413
All the same.
Befriend him.

35:53.496 --> 35:54.539
Yes.

35:54.623 --> 35:56.333
And make him
write to me.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.835
And I'll write back.

35:58.919 --> 36:01.421
We'll exchange long,
poetic love letters.

36:01.504 --> 36:02.881
I will suggest that
he write to you...

36:02.964 --> 36:05.717
but I cannot control the content
or length of his letters.

36:08.303 --> 36:09.971
You are always so kind.

36:16.978 --> 36:17.979
No.

36:20.065 --> 36:22.526
You said you have a confession
to make, too.

36:24.486 --> 36:25.987
It's not important.

36:26.071 --> 36:27.656
I will support you
as you've supported me.

36:27.739 --> 36:29.366
Really, it's nothing.

36:31.535 --> 36:32.911
How's the hand?

36:32.994 --> 36:34.079
Painless.

36:34.162 --> 36:35.747
A scratch.

36:35.830 --> 36:38.083
How many men
did you duel with last night?

36:38.166 --> 36:39.459
A hundred.

36:39.543 --> 36:40.835
Really?

36:41.211 --> 36:42.546
Ten.

36:44.756 --> 36:47.300
All the same,
what courage.

36:50.845 --> 36:52.514
I've done better since.

36:56.017 --> 36:58.478
And one, two, three.

36:58.562 --> 37:01.773
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

37:01.857 --> 37:04.943
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

37:05.026 --> 37:08.029
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

37:08.113 --> 37:11.116
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

37:11.199 --> 37:12.951
One, two, three.

37:13.034 --> 37:16.496
And one, two. One, two.

37:16.580 --> 37:18.874
One, two. One, two.

37:18.957 --> 37:21.459
One, two. One, two.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.336
One, two, three.

37:24.254 --> 37:25.714
Captain.

37:27.549 --> 37:30.719
I heard of your recent
adventures.

37:30.802 --> 37:33.471
I've come to express
my admiration.

37:33.555 --> 37:34.598
Cyrano.

37:37.601 --> 37:40.812
I'm inviting you
to join my retinue.

37:40.896 --> 37:45.400
I thank the Duke for his
generous offer, but I must decline.

37:46.151 --> 37:47.819
Carry on!

37:47.903 --> 37:50.363
There are a great many
advantages to following me.

37:50.447 --> 37:51.531
I know.

37:51.615 --> 37:54.993
But I follow no one.

37:55.076 --> 37:59.372
I'm told that you write poetry
in common with a great many men these days.

37:59.456 --> 38:03.001
However, I'm told that you write
poetry uncommonly well.

38:03.084 --> 38:05.712
I like to publish those
that I admire.

38:05.795 --> 38:08.340
I could put you into print,
distinguish you.

38:08.423 --> 38:10.717
I'd only change a few lines.
I pay handsomely.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.012
You could buy a fine pair of
calfskin gloves.

38:14.095 --> 38:15.847
I'm not for sale.
Neither is my work.

38:15.931 --> 38:17.849
Aren't you proud.
Aren't you observant.

38:17.933 --> 38:19.851
Take this seriously.

38:19.935 --> 38:21.937
Those men last night
were incompetent.

38:22.020 --> 38:23.647
Others may not be.

38:25.482 --> 38:27.025
Someone's taken
against you.

38:27.108 --> 38:30.195
Join my retinue,
you'll be protected.

38:30.278 --> 38:32.697
First, you try to recruit me,
then you try to buy me.

38:32.781 --> 38:34.950
When you learn
I have no price...

38:35.033 --> 38:38.495
you warn me that my life is
threatened by an unknown enemy.

38:38.578 --> 38:40.121
I saw you last night.

38:40.205 --> 38:42.165
The blood of those men
is on your hands.

38:42.249 --> 38:44.543
You're a tyrant
posing as a noble.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.045
Oh, what a shame
we can't accommodate each other.

38:47.128 --> 38:48.713
'Cause you know something?

38:48.797 --> 38:51.424
You'd make a sweet little
companion to the acquisition I will make.

38:51.841 --> 38:53.051
Roxanne.

38:55.011 --> 38:56.221
Guards!

38:59.140 --> 39:00.350
<i>Don't push him too far.</i>

39:00.433 --> 39:02.811
To be his enemy
is a badge of honor.

39:02.894 --> 39:04.187
Which might
get you killed.

39:04.271 --> 39:05.355
Let him try.

39:05.438 --> 39:07.315
I'll best any he sends.

39:07.399 --> 39:08.441
Let them come.

39:08.525 --> 39:09.901
He offered you
a good wage.

39:09.985 --> 39:11.069
I belong here.

39:11.152 --> 39:13.238
With you. With them.

39:13.321 --> 39:16.324
Left! Left! Left! Right! Left!

39:16.408 --> 39:18.910
<i>I will not be his toy.</i>

39:18.994 --> 39:20.829
What would you
have me do, Le Bret?

39:21.663 --> 39:23.248
Join his retinue?

39:23.331 --> 39:24.416
No, thank you.

39:24.499 --> 39:27.085
<i>Dedicate poems</i>
<i>to de Guiche?</i>

39:27.168 --> 39:28.336
<i>No, thank you.</i>

39:35.886 --> 39:37.178
I've heard
how this works.

39:39.180 --> 39:40.181
Who's first?

39:45.187 --> 39:47.564
Do you want me
to swallow insults?

39:47.647 --> 39:49.941
To crawl? To kneel?
To beg?

39:50.025 --> 39:52.027
Play both sides?
Flatter? No, thank you.

39:53.904 --> 39:56.448
<i>Live for other people's</i>
<i>opinions of me?</i>

39:56.531 --> 39:59.451
No, thank you. I prefer a
different life. My own.

39:59.534 --> 40:02.287
I answer to no one,
and I am content, thank you.

40:04.748 --> 40:05.874
She doesn't love you?

40:07.751 --> 40:08.835
Don't...

40:08.919 --> 40:10.212
ever say it.

40:12.214 --> 40:13.924
Who's next?

40:16.051 --> 40:17.052
I am.

40:17.719 --> 40:18.720
 Cyrano!

40:21.932 --> 40:26.019
Cyrano! Cyrano! Cyrano!

40:27.854 --> 40:29.481
What's so funny?

40:29.564 --> 40:32.484
First, I fight an elephant, and
now a mole?

40:33.693 --> 40:35.403
What's your name?

40:35.487 --> 40:36.696
Why?

40:36.780 --> 40:39.950
I just like to know
the names of the men I kill.

40:42.577 --> 40:45.247
I'm Christian Neuvillette, sir.

40:48.124 --> 40:49.417
Embrace me.

40:51.795 --> 40:52.963
Sir!

40:56.341 --> 40:57.592
I'm her brother.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.644
Whose brother?

41:07.727 --> 41:09.104
Who do you think?

41:09.187 --> 41:10.313
Roxanne.
Roxanne?

41:10.397 --> 41:11.439
Hmm.

41:13.441 --> 41:14.734
Yes.

41:14.818 --> 41:16.111
You don't look
like her brother.

41:16.194 --> 41:18.196
We're old friends,
like siblings but not.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.364
We're very close.

41:19.447 --> 41:20.699
And what...
She's told me everything.

41:20.782 --> 41:22.534
The theater,
love at first sight, all of it.

41:22.617 --> 41:23.827
She loves me?

41:23.910 --> 41:25.287
She believes so.

41:25.370 --> 41:26.830
Sir, I am so glad
to know you!

41:26.913 --> 41:28.164
Yes, enough of that.

41:28.248 --> 41:29.541
-Please forgive me for insulting you earlier.
-Yes.

41:29.624 --> 41:30.625
I just...
Yes, yes.

41:30.709 --> 41:32.544
She loves me!
Now, listen.

41:32.627 --> 41:34.004
She loves me!

41:34.087 --> 41:35.755
Roxanne wants
a letter from you.

41:37.007 --> 41:38.049
No?
Impossible.

41:38.133 --> 41:39.217
If I write to her,
it'll drive her away.

41:39.301 --> 41:40.385
Really? Why?

41:40.468 --> 41:41.469
I can't write
love letters.

41:41.553 --> 41:42.554
Rabbit.

41:42.637 --> 41:44.097
Sorry?

41:44.180 --> 41:47.893
You just say
what you feel.

41:47.976 --> 41:50.478
As long as it's true,
you can't go wrong.

41:50.562 --> 41:53.857
But a woman
like Roxanne wants wit, romance.

41:53.940 --> 41:56.234
Maybe even poetry.

41:56.318 --> 41:57.485
You're right.

41:57.569 --> 41:59.738
You'd better leave town.

41:59.821 --> 42:00.822
Oh, I didn't mean it.

42:01.489 --> 42:02.532
I'm very confused.

42:02.616 --> 42:04.242
Are you here to help me
or hinder me?

42:04.326 --> 42:05.577
Help.
Good.

42:05.660 --> 42:07.495
You see, in battle I have
inordinate courage.

42:07.579 --> 42:08.914
I can do anything.

42:08.997 --> 42:11.750
But with women,
my whole life I've been useless.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.335
Silent. I'm...

42:13.418 --> 42:15.587
What's the word for when you're
bad at expressing yourself?

42:15.670 --> 42:17.297
Inarticulate.
That's it.

42:17.380 --> 42:21.259
I can't explain what I feel,
not on paper, and not on paper.

42:21.343 --> 42:23.428
I don't know
how to speak romantically.

42:23.511 --> 42:25.263
Roxanne will be extremely
disappointed.

42:25.347 --> 42:26.431
She must not be.

42:26.514 --> 42:27.641
But I have no wit.

42:32.521 --> 42:33.688
Borrow mine.

42:37.234 --> 42:39.736
My words
upon your lips.

42:39.819 --> 42:40.904
I can't.
It's a lie.

42:40.987 --> 42:42.113
I'd be deceiving
the woman I love.

42:42.197 --> 42:43.448
It's better than
losing her.

42:43.532 --> 42:45.617
Call it a fantasy, call it a
dream, call it pretend.

42:45.700 --> 42:48.078
A dream might be a lie,
but it's also true.

42:48.161 --> 42:49.204
Wait, what?

42:49.287 --> 42:51.623
Sometimes illusion
is kind.

42:51.706 --> 42:53.375
Is it?
I think so.

42:53.458 --> 42:55.126
Read a book or two.
You'll find out.

42:55.210 --> 42:56.461
There's no need to
be patronizing.

42:56.545 --> 42:57.546
I'm sorry.

42:57.629 --> 42:58.630
Accepted.

42:58.713 --> 42:59.798
But will
the deceit work?

42:59.881 --> 43:01.466
Is the prize
not worth the risk?

43:01.550 --> 43:02.968
Yes.

43:03.051 --> 43:04.386
Oh, Roxanne...

43:04.469 --> 43:05.845
Oh, Roxanne...

43:07.722 --> 43:10.725
will be so pleased
to receive your letter.

43:13.353 --> 43:15.856
May I ask,
why are you helping me?

43:16.898 --> 43:19.109
What can you gain?

43:19.192 --> 43:22.654
My words go to waste
unless spoken aloud.

43:22.737 --> 43:26.491
I will make you eloquent
while you make me handsome.

43:29.202 --> 43:34.666
<i>God, what I'd do to just be</i>
<i>able to tell her</i>

43:34.749 --> 43:37.878
<i>What it's like</i>
<i>when I see her</i>

43:41.423 --> 43:43.174
<i>It's something like</i>

43:43.258 --> 43:44.342
<i>Happiness</i>

43:44.426 --> 43:46.136
<i>It's something like</i>

43:46.219 --> 43:47.429
<i>Hunger</i>

43:47.512 --> 43:49.014
<i>And something like</i>

43:49.097 --> 43:51.349
<i>Fear</i>

43:51.433 --> 43:56.146
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say</i>

43:57.772 --> 44:00.609
<i>All the words</i>
<i>I don't have</i>

44:00.692 --> 44:03.695
<i>And I can't</i>
<i>put together</i>

44:03.778 --> 44:09.826
<i>I'd give anything for</i>
<i>someone to say to her</i>

44:09.910 --> 44:13.705
<i>That she's all</i>
<i>I can think about</i>

44:13.788 --> 44:16.625
<i>And I can't live</i>
<i>without her</i>

44:32.557 --> 44:35.727
<i>My father told me</i>

44:35.810 --> 44:42.817
<i>Letters and books</i>
<i>weren't meant for the son of a soldier</i>

44:45.153 --> 44:47.906
<i>Courage and steel</i>

44:47.989 --> 44:52.494
<i>The trials of the
real world are what matter</i>

44:52.577 --> 44:55.664
<i>And all that</i>
<i>should mold you</i>

44:57.499 --> 44:59.501
<i>God, what I'd do</i>

44:59.584 --> 45:03.296
<i>To have the one thing</i>
<i>that you have</i>

45:03.380 --> 45:05.590
<i>That I never will</i>

45:09.177 --> 45:12.639
<i>You have something</i>
<i>worth giving</i>

45:12.722 --> 45:15.475
<i>A reason for living</i>

45:15.559 --> 45:17.060
<i>All I do well is...</i>

45:17.143 --> 45:18.144
<i>Kill</i>

45:19.771 --> 45:24.609
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say</i>

45:25.986 --> 45:29.114
<i>All the words I don't have</i>

45:29.197 --> 45:32.117
<i>And I can't put together</i>

45:32.200 --> 45:37.247
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say to her</i>

45:38.582 --> 45:40.292
<i>That she's all</i>
<i>I can think about</i>

45:42.210 --> 45:44.629
<i>And I can't</i>
<i>live without her</i>

45:44.713 --> 45:49.509
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say</i>

45:50.886 --> 45:54.264
<i>That they can't live</i>
<i>without me</i>

45:54.347 --> 45:57.100
<i>And they'll</i>
<i>be there forever</i>

45:57.184 --> 45:59.686
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say to me</i>

46:03.356 --> 46:07.152
<i>That no matter</i>
<i>how bad it gets</i>

46:07.235 --> 46:11.072
<i>They won't</i>
<i>turn away from me</i>

46:16.077 --> 46:17.370
Here.

46:18.830 --> 46:20.832
Just sign your name
on the bottom.

46:20.916 --> 46:22.459
Great.
When did you write it?

46:22.542 --> 46:23.752
A while ago.

46:23.835 --> 46:25.462
-But... I always have
-a letter in my pocket...

46:25.545 --> 46:27.297
written to
an imaginary woman.

46:27.380 --> 46:28.840
It's the romantic
custom here.

46:28.924 --> 46:30.842
But don't you need to
make it specific to her?

46:30.926 --> 46:34.012
Count on vanity to make Roxanne
think it is only for her.

46:34.095 --> 46:36.640
But the letter itself is
applicable to all women?

46:36.723 --> 46:39.184
Not all.

46:39.267 --> 46:41.520
I'm convinced we're destined to
be friends for life.

46:41.603 --> 46:43.146
You think?

46:43.230 --> 46:44.773
The very best of friends.

46:58.453 --> 47:00.830
And I,
my heart will lend.

47:10.048 --> 47:11.132
Roxanne's?

47:11.841 --> 47:12.842
Thank you.

47:16.137 --> 47:17.639
WO
Come on, children. Hurry up.

47:58.179 --> 47:59.180
Roxanne...

48:03.351 --> 48:07.814
<i>The ink on the paper</i>
<i>makes me nervous</i>

48:07.898 --> 48:11.276
<i>I nearly lose my vision</i>

48:11.359 --> 48:18.450
<i>And then my breath</i>
<i>and my pulse and my mind quicken</i>

48:18.533 --> 48:22.120
<i>Head below my knees</i>
<i>I come alive</i>

48:22.204 --> 48:26.625
<i>With every stroke of
every letter in every line you write</i>

48:26.708 --> 48:29.669
<i>Keeps me awake</i>
<i>thinking back</i>

48:29.753 --> 48:35.217
<i>Oh, my first sight of you</i>
<i>was my first heart attack</i>

48:35.300 --> 48:38.845
<i>Every letter makes me</i>
<i>lose my reason</i>

48:38.929 --> 48:40.347
<i>Every word is like</i>
<i>your kindest touch</i>

48:43.225 --> 48:46.770
<i>And if I told you</i>
<i>how much I need you</i>

48:46.853 --> 48:49.564
<i>Would you give me yourself</i>
<i>or turn and run?</i>

48:51.942 --> 48:55.779
<i>You light up desire</i>
<i>just by describing it</i>

48:55.862 --> 48:59.616
<i>I read to myself</i>
<i>until I go blind</i>

48:59.699 --> 49:03.995
<i>Your words fall around me</i>
<i>all through the night</i>

49:04.079 --> 49:07.165
<i>I can't resist</i>
<i>and I don't want to fight</i>

49:07.249 --> 49:09.042
<i>Will you be held?</i>

49:09.125 --> 49:10.794
<i>Will you be touched?</i>

49:10.877 --> 49:12.796
<i>By my hand</i>
<i>through this paper</i>

49:12.879 --> 49:15.006
<i>Is this all too much?</i>

49:15.090 --> 49:17.050
<i>Will we be ravaged?</i>

49:17.133 --> 49:18.843
<i>Will we be true?</i>

49:18.927 --> 49:22.973
<i>To somebody perfect</i>
<i>somebody like you</i>

49:23.056 --> 49:25.016
<i>I'm tired</i>
<i>of yearning</i>

49:25.100 --> 49:27.018
<i>I'm tired</i>
<i>of learning</i>

49:27.102 --> 49:28.979
<i>I need to drink you</i>

49:29.062 --> 49:31.189
<i>My heart</i>
<i>has been burning</i>

49:31.273 --> 49:33.108
<i>Ever since I saw you</i>

49:33.191 --> 49:35.193
<i>Backwards through the glass</i>

49:35.277 --> 49:37.028
<i>Of a thin windowpane</i>

49:37.112 --> 49:39.072
<i>Like a thin</i>
<i>see-through mask</i>

49:39.155 --> 49:41.116
<i>These words are the truth</i>

49:41.199 --> 49:42.742
<i>Just let them sink in</i>

49:42.826 --> 49:45.370
<i>Through your</i>
<i>thin-fingered gloves</i>

49:45.453 --> 49:47.205
<i>To your hand, to your skin</i>

49:47.289 --> 49:49.207
<i>Like ribbons on wrist</i>

49:49.291 --> 49:51.209
<i>Let them hold you</i>
<i>and twist</i>

49:51.293 --> 49:53.461
<i>Let them</i>
<i>touch you all over</i>

49:53.545 --> 49:55.839
<i>Until you can't resist</i>

49:55.922 --> 49:59.509
- <i>Every letter makes me</i>
-<i>lose my reason</i>

49:59.593 --> 50:03.847
<i>Every word is</i>
<i>like your kindest touch</i>

50:03.930 --> 50:07.392
<i>And if I told you</i>
<i>how much I need you</i>

50:07.475 --> 50:11.396
<i>Would you give me yourself</i>
<i>or turn and run?</i>

50:11.479 --> 50:16.526
<i>Would you give me yourself</i>
<i>or turn and run?</i>

50:16.610 --> 50:20.530
- <i>You light up desire</i>
-<i>just by describing it</i>

50:20.614 --> 50:24.492
<i>I read to myself</i>
<i>until I go blind</i>

50:24.576 --> 50:29.164
<i>Your words fall around me</i>
<i>all through the night</i>

50:29.247 --> 50:32.876
<i>I can't resist</i>
<i>and I don't wanna fight</i>

50:32.959 --> 50:34.336
<i>Dim the lights</i>

50:34.419 --> 50:36.588
<i>Give me everything I want</i>

50:36.671 --> 50:40.717
<i>Just talk to me like you do</i>
<i>in your songs</i>

50:40.800 --> 50:44.763
<i>Your letters are drawings</i>
<i>on me from above</i>

50:44.846 --> 50:49.601
<i>I know who you are</i>
<i>And I know you are love</i>

50:49.684 --> 50:51.728
 <i>Every day I think</i>
<i>I couldn't love him any more.</i>

50:51.811 --> 50:53.772
Then a new letter arrives,
and my heart expands...

50:53.855 --> 50:55.357
to accommodate
more love.

51:02.822 --> 51:04.783
He understands me
instinctively.

51:04.866 --> 51:07.744
He knows exactly what I respond
to, what thrills me.

51:07.827 --> 51:08.912
It's uncanny.

51:08.995 --> 51:10.622
I'm pleased
for you.

51:10.705 --> 51:11.915
Are you really?

51:11.998 --> 51:13.458
Why wouldn't I be?

51:13.542 --> 51:15.961
It's quite tedious having to
listen to someone waxing on...

51:16.044 --> 51:17.546
about finding
true love.

51:23.718 --> 51:25.053
I wanted to
meet with him.

51:26.179 --> 51:27.722
In private.

51:29.057 --> 51:30.559
Can you arrange it?

51:31.893 --> 51:34.187
Would you love him
if he wasn't handsome?

51:35.897 --> 51:38.316
I cannot imagine it.

51:38.400 --> 51:42.445
He is beautiful, and he
expresses himself beautifully.

51:44.406 --> 51:46.199
It's perfectly logical.

51:48.577 --> 51:52.289
"The more you take of my heart,
the more I have to give.

51:52.372 --> 51:54.916
"Since I need a heart
to long for you...

51:56.376 --> 51:59.504
"keep mine
and send me yours."

51:59.588 --> 52:03.216
First he has too much heart,
and then not enough?

52:03.758 --> 52:04.843
You're jealous.

52:04.926 --> 52:06.011
Me?

52:06.094 --> 52:07.512
 It's fascinating.

52:07.596 --> 52:09.514
You're both brilliant,
but exact opposites in style.

52:10.765 --> 52:13.226
Christian is overt...

52:14.060 --> 52:15.395
passionate...

52:15.478 --> 52:16.521
fiery.

52:16.605 --> 52:17.939
Whereas I?

52:18.481 --> 52:20.108
You are coded...

52:21.776 --> 52:22.861
witty...

52:22.944 --> 52:23.945
rueful.

52:24.905 --> 52:26.406
"Coded"?

52:26.489 --> 52:28.867
His words aren't better than
yours, just differently put.

52:28.950 --> 52:30.994
But both are
endlessly quotable.

52:31.077 --> 52:32.329
You know his letters
by heart?

52:35.790 --> 52:36.791
Every one.

52:40.795 --> 52:42.714
You will arrange
the meeting?

52:42.797 --> 52:45.967
As ever,
I am at your service.

52:54.809 --> 52:56.436
I've come
to say goodbye.

52:56.520 --> 52:58.980
I leave tonight
for the front.

52:59.064 --> 53:00.941
It's grim,
but orders are orders.

53:02.108 --> 53:03.818
We're losing the war.

53:03.902 --> 53:06.613
They've promoted
the nobility to turn it around.

53:06.696 --> 53:10.116
As you can see,
they've made me a colonel.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.035
Me.

53:12.118 --> 53:15.413
Shows how desperate
they are.

53:15.497 --> 53:17.916
Does this new rank put you
in command of the guards?

53:17.999 --> 53:20.752
It does.
Cyrano is mine.

53:20.835 --> 53:22.754
And the guards
are being sent to the front?

53:22.837 --> 53:24.756
Naturally.
They're in my regiment.

53:24.839 --> 53:25.882
All of them?

53:25.966 --> 53:26.967
Of course.

53:33.139 --> 53:35.767
Why so upset,
dear lady?

53:35.851 --> 53:37.018
You are
going to war.

53:38.144 --> 53:39.896
You might die.

53:39.980 --> 53:41.523
You are leaving tonight.

53:41.606 --> 53:43.608
I am beside myself.

53:43.692 --> 53:47.696
 Can I take this
as a sign of your affection?

53:49.531 --> 53:51.116
I must tell you.

53:51.199 --> 53:53.577
Cyrano and I
are no longer friends.

53:54.202 --> 53:56.454
 Oh?

53:56.538 --> 53:59.499
I ended the friendship,
as you counseled.

53:59.583 --> 54:00.667
Good.

54:00.750 --> 54:04.796
I know how
you could make him suffer.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.172
Oh?

54:06.256 --> 54:10.677
Why don't you leave him
and all the guards behind?

54:10.760 --> 54:13.972
Here in the city
with the women and children.

54:14.055 --> 54:15.891
Oh, he'll hate that.

54:15.974 --> 54:19.144
More than hate,
it would humiliate him.

54:19.227 --> 54:22.147
No heroics, no medals.

54:22.230 --> 54:24.900
His warrior pride
is his great weakness.

54:24.983 --> 54:29.696
Am I to understand
this as an act of love?

54:31.615 --> 54:32.741
It is.

54:35.076 --> 54:38.538
I hereby bury his orders
to the front.

54:40.207 --> 54:42.000
Poor little Cyrano...

54:42.083 --> 54:43.710
and his
poor little friends.

54:47.589 --> 54:49.716
Marie, some tea.

54:52.552 --> 54:54.471
I'm afraid we are
out of tea, sir.

54:54.554 --> 54:55.931
Leave us.

55:06.858 --> 55:09.736
I like your tricks.

55:11.863 --> 55:13.657
I wager
you know some more.

55:14.241 --> 55:15.325
No, sir.

55:15.408 --> 55:16.868
Oh, I think you do.

55:16.952 --> 55:18.787
How can I leave you?

55:19.955 --> 55:21.456
Maybe I won't.

55:22.415 --> 55:23.750
Roxanne...

55:26.127 --> 55:27.879
I love you.

55:27.963 --> 55:29.422
I love you.

55:30.966 --> 55:33.218
It's a terrible shame,
but leave you must.

55:33.301 --> 55:35.220
The battle
can't happen...

55:35.303 --> 55:36.513
without the colonel.

55:39.766 --> 55:41.768
I so admire
your bravery.

55:41.852 --> 55:43.061
Yeah, I'm not brave.

55:43.144 --> 55:45.355
I'm dutiful.
You are too modest.

55:45.438 --> 55:47.858
It is you who will lead
the charge into battle.

55:49.609 --> 55:52.946
I could not love a man
who hides from danger.

55:53.029 --> 55:54.823
Do you love me?

55:56.449 --> 55:58.869
I love the man
for whom I fear.

56:01.329 --> 56:03.707
So I must go to war?

56:07.085 --> 56:08.086
Yes.

56:23.518 --> 56:25.103
This is folly.

56:25.187 --> 56:26.855
She said she wants to meet me,
so what's wrong with surprising her?

56:26.938 --> 56:28.064
You're not prepared.

56:28.148 --> 56:29.274
She loves me,
I don't need to prepare.

56:29.357 --> 56:31.026
Why can't you relax?

56:31.109 --> 56:32.569
Can you at least take a look at
these conversational witticisms?

56:32.652 --> 56:33.737
No, thank you.

56:33.820 --> 56:35.030
Memorize this now!

56:35.113 --> 56:36.573
I'm going to
speak to her in my own words.

56:36.656 --> 56:38.825
I strongly advise
against that.

56:38.909 --> 56:40.952
And when the moment is right,
I'll take her in my arms.

56:41.036 --> 56:43.455
There will be no moment
if you don't study these.

56:43.538 --> 56:45.040
I'll be fine.

56:45.123 --> 56:47.292
All your fancy words and phrases
are now a part of my vocabulary.

56:47.375 --> 56:48.960
I'll simply repeat them.

56:49.044 --> 56:50.128
No, wait, what is it?

56:50.212 --> 56:51.296
Regurgitate?

56:51.379 --> 56:53.048
That's it!
That's what I will do.

56:53.840 --> 56:55.217
Off you go then.

57:05.560 --> 57:08.980
I'm very grateful
for your help...

57:09.064 --> 57:11.733
but, with extreme respect, I
don't think I need you anymore.

57:12.317 --> 57:13.318
Very well.

57:15.153 --> 57:16.863
Fly to Roxanne.

57:16.947 --> 57:19.699
Dazzle her with your
transcendent words.

57:23.119 --> 57:24.120
Yeah.

57:35.090 --> 57:36.508
WO Can you imagine?

57:37.717 --> 57:38.969
Champagne!

58:04.119 --> 58:06.663
- <i>"We don't write poems</i>
-<i>to be happy.</i>

58:06.746 --> 58:08.665
"We write
to discover meaning.

58:08.748 --> 58:12.669
"We write to revenge loss
and explicate love...

58:12.752 --> 58:14.546
"to miss nothing in the profound
hope that upon our deaths...

58:16.923 --> 58:18.216
"we continue...

58:21.928 --> 58:25.223
"to live in the words."

58:33.148 --> 58:34.649
Christian.

58:36.318 --> 58:37.485
Hello.

58:38.570 --> 58:40.363
How did you know
I was here?

58:40.447 --> 58:44.743
Which is not to say that I
flatter myself by thinking you are here to see me.

58:44.826 --> 58:46.077
I heard about this...

58:46.161 --> 58:47.329
Women's-only salon?

58:49.497 --> 58:51.499
Yes. From a friend.

58:52.417 --> 58:53.543
Is she here?

58:53.627 --> 58:54.753
No, she's a man.

58:54.836 --> 58:56.254
I mean, he is.

58:59.507 --> 59:01.426
Will you come with me?

59:01.509 --> 59:03.011
So we can talk?

59:05.430 --> 59:06.681
Of course.

59:13.688 --> 59:15.023
Isn't it beautiful?

59:19.694 --> 59:21.613
Do you suffer
from vertigo?

59:21.696 --> 59:23.532
No. But I don't
like heights.

59:44.886 --> 59:48.306
There are some silences
that are comfortable...

59:48.390 --> 59:51.977
and then there are some
that are freighted with tension.

59:52.060 --> 59:54.646
What do you think
the nature of this one is?

59:58.275 --> 01:00:01.820
I think it's
a bit of both.

01:00:02.737 --> 01:00:03.822
I agree.

01:00:10.579 --> 01:00:11.746
Talk to me.

01:00:13.915 --> 01:00:15.000
I love you.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.126
Yes.

01:00:18.128 --> 01:00:25.218
Sometimes raw, simple words are
the most potent deployment of language.

01:00:25.302 --> 01:00:26.386
I love you.

01:00:26.469 --> 01:00:29.264
The sheer surprise
of repetition.

01:00:30.015 --> 01:00:31.933
But say some more.

01:00:32.017 --> 01:00:33.143
What else?

01:00:34.603 --> 01:00:36.605
I love you so much.

01:00:40.317 --> 01:00:43.069
When you write, you say it in a
thousand different ways...

01:00:43.153 --> 01:00:48.700
without ever resorting to those
three overused little words.

01:00:48.783 --> 01:00:50.535
Which little words?

01:00:50.619 --> 01:00:54.539
Please,
my dearest Christian...

01:00:54.623 --> 01:00:58.126
speak to me
like you do in your letters.

01:01:02.047 --> 01:01:05.717
You are an angel
to be adored.

01:01:07.052 --> 01:01:10.305
My love is
so, so big...

01:01:12.682 --> 01:01:14.559
it is absord.

01:01:14.643 --> 01:01:16.436
I'm sorry?

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.480
You are
a beautiful flower.

01:01:19.981 --> 01:01:21.525
May I smell your neck?

01:01:22.651 --> 01:01:26.821
Or give it a peck
at this violet hour?

01:01:26.905 --> 01:01:29.407
Neuvillette, sir.

01:01:29.491 --> 01:01:30.575
Don't go!
Please wait.

01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:31.910
My passion has
rendered me...

01:01:31.993 --> 01:01:33.203
What is it?
Stupid?

01:01:33.286 --> 01:01:34.454
No, but it does
begin with an "S."

01:01:34.538 --> 01:01:36.373
Let me know when
you've found it.

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:39.543
And I am not a flower.

01:01:40.168 --> 01:01:41.294
I need more.

01:01:41.378 --> 01:01:42.754
I need more.

01:01:42.837 --> 01:01:44.005
I need more.

01:01:49.844 --> 01:01:53.765
<i>I need more</i>

01:01:53.848 --> 01:01:55.892
<i>I need more</i>
<i>I need more</i>

01:01:55.976 --> 01:02:00.772
<i>Don't you dare</i>
<i>tell me you love me</i>

01:02:00.856 --> 01:02:04.693
<i>I've heard that line before</i>

01:02:05.944 --> 01:02:07.112
Speechless!

01:02:07.195 --> 01:02:08.697
That's the word.

01:02:16.538 --> 01:02:17.789
That went well.

01:02:17.873 --> 01:02:19.249
You spied on us?

01:02:20.542 --> 01:02:22.335
I couldn't resist.

01:02:23.211 --> 01:02:24.337
Help me.

01:02:24.421 --> 01:02:25.964
Please.

01:02:26.047 --> 01:02:27.591
No.

01:02:28.425 --> 01:02:31.511
You don't need me.

01:02:31.595 --> 01:02:35.348
<i>Talk of the blank space</i>
<i>behind the sun</i>

01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:36.808
<i>Where you told me</i>
<i>you'd meet me when everyone's gone</i>

01:02:39.436 --> 01:02:42.314
<i>Tell me that</i>
<i>nothing makes sense</i>

01:02:42.397 --> 01:02:45.150
<i>But the sound of my voice</i>
<i>in your head</i>

01:02:45.233 --> 01:02:48.361
<i>Even when</i>
<i>I'm nowhere around</i>

01:02:48.445 --> 01:02:52.824
<i>Make love make sense</i>
<i>in the loveliest way</i>

01:02:52.908 --> 01:02:56.828
<i>Infinite and simple</i>
<i>in an ink black sky</i>

01:02:56.912 --> 01:03:00.832
<i>Turn me to water</i>
<i>like your letters do</i>

01:03:00.916 --> 01:03:05.003
<i>Make me not know</i>
<i>whether to laugh or cry</i>

01:03:05.086 --> 01:03:09.132
<i>I need more</i>

01:03:09.216 --> 01:03:11.092
<i>I need more</i>

01:03:11.176 --> 01:03:16.014
<i>I need waves of desire</i>
<i>to come over me</i>

01:03:16.097 --> 01:03:20.185
<i>And teardrops</i>
<i>on the floor</i>

01:03:20.268 --> 01:03:25.190
-<i>I feel like I've
been too long</i> -<i>with my thoughts anyway</i>

01:03:25.273 --> 01:03:29.027
<i>I've cornered myself</i>
<i>in the loneliest place</i>

01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:33.365
<i>I won't let you lose me</i>
<i>now that you've found me</i>

01:03:33.448 --> 01:03:37.369
<i>You know what to say</i>
<i>so just say it now to me</i>

01:03:37.452 --> 01:03:41.206
<i>I float through the hours</i>
<i>with everyone else</i>

01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:45.502
<i>But I always only</i>
<i>think of you by myself</i>

01:03:45.585 --> 01:03:48.338
<i>Tell me your secrets</i>
<i>Who are you in private?</i>

01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:49.881
Oh.

01:03:49.965 --> 01:03:53.969
<i>When you can't sleep</i>
<i>tell me how you survive it</i>

01:03:54.052 --> 01:03:57.931
<i>I need more</i>

01:03:58.014 --> 01:03:59.933
<i>I need more</i>

01:04:00.016 --> 01:04:04.938
<i>I need waves of desire</i>
<i>to come over me</i>

01:04:05.021 --> 01:04:08.149
<i>And teardrops</i>
<i>on the floor</i>

01:04:08.233 --> 01:04:09.526
Help me. I beg you.

01:04:09.609 --> 01:04:11.194
If I don't win her back,
I'll die.

01:04:11.278 --> 01:04:13.446
 Then you'd better
improve your regurgitation skills.

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:15.907
All right,
I need you.

01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:18.326
I was an idiot to believe I
didn't. I apologize.

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:20.078
You need me?
Always.

01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:21.997
Am I essential?
Of course.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.915
Will you say my words without
pedantry, prevarication, or quibbling?

01:04:27.878 --> 01:04:28.962
Just say yes.

01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:30.171
Yes.

01:04:30.255 --> 01:04:31.715
Good. Follow me.

01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:36.761
<i>I need more</i>

01:04:36.845 --> 01:04:38.471
<i>I need more</i>

01:04:38.555 --> 01:04:43.768
<i>Don't you dare tell me</i>
<i>you love me</i>

01:04:43.852 --> 01:04:47.647
<i>I've heard that line before</i>

01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:51.193
<i>I've heard that line before</i>

01:04:51.276 --> 01:04:53.945
<i>I need more</i>

01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:55.363
Right. Now, you stand there.

01:04:56.072 --> 01:04:57.699
And I will be here.

01:04:57.782 --> 01:04:59.826
And when she returns, I will
whisper what you must say to her.

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:01.494
No.

01:05:01.578 --> 01:05:03.830
Yes.
I will feed you the words.

01:05:03.914 --> 01:05:05.874
It's madness!
How can it possibly work?

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:10.879
Do not
ruin this again.

01:05:24.768 --> 01:05:26.144
Roxanne.

01:05:26.228 --> 01:05:27.729
Roxanne.

01:05:33.068 --> 01:05:34.236
Who's there?

01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:35.862
Speechless Christian.

01:05:35.946 --> 01:05:37.614
I must talk to you.

01:05:37.697 --> 01:05:39.991
I'd rather
read your letters.

01:05:40.075 --> 01:05:41.660
Please.

01:05:41.743 --> 01:05:44.538
Do you regret
what happened this evening?

01:05:44.621 --> 01:05:46.081
Yes.

01:05:46.414 --> 01:05:47.624
Yes?

01:05:49.584 --> 01:05:52.337
That's your considered
explanation and apology?

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.839
I'm beginning to fear
you're just a weird young man...

01:05:54.923 --> 01:05:57.175
who likes writing letters.

01:05:57.259 --> 01:05:58.802
Maybe you don't even
love me.

01:05:59.803 --> 01:06:01.263
Good night.

01:06:02.514 --> 01:06:03.557
Wait.

01:06:06.142 --> 01:06:07.727
I could no more
stop loving you...

01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:09.855
I could no more
stop loving you...

01:06:09.938 --> 01:06:11.648
...than I could
stop the sun rising.

01:06:11.731 --> 01:06:13.525
...than I can
stop the sun rising.

01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:16.444
Really?

01:06:16.528 --> 01:06:20.198
My cruel love has never stopped
growing in my soul...

01:06:20.282 --> 01:06:22.033
From the day
it was born there.

01:06:22.117 --> 01:06:23.451
...from the day
it was born.

01:06:24.578 --> 01:06:26.162
There.
There.

01:06:27.455 --> 01:06:30.876
If your love is cruel,
you should have killed it.

01:06:30.959 --> 01:06:32.627
I tried.

01:06:32.711 --> 01:06:36.089
-It has the strength of Hercules. I tried.
-It has the strength of...

01:06:36.172 --> 01:06:37.299
Hercules.

01:06:37.382 --> 01:06:38.884
...Hercules.

01:06:38.967 --> 01:06:40.010
Got anything better?

01:06:41.386 --> 01:06:44.723
Do continue. Please.

01:06:44.806 --> 01:06:47.392
Roxanne, my love for you
is so powerful...

01:06:47.475 --> 01:06:51.062
Roxanne, my love for you
is so powerful...

01:06:51.146 --> 01:06:52.731
...it has strangled
the two serpents...

01:06:52.814 --> 01:06:54.941
...it has strangled
the two serpents...

01:06:55.984 --> 01:06:57.319
pride and doubt.

01:06:59.988 --> 01:07:01.489
Why do you speak
so haltingly?

01:07:03.033 --> 01:07:04.242
This is impossible.

01:07:04.326 --> 01:07:05.702
No, it's working,
keep going.

01:07:05.785 --> 01:07:07.662
Are you going to
answer my question?

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:13.668
My speech seems halting...

01:07:13.752 --> 01:07:18.423
because in this darkness my
words must stumble to your ear.

01:07:18.506 --> 01:07:19.758
What are you doing?

01:07:19.841 --> 01:07:22.093
 My words have no such
difficulty.

01:07:22.177 --> 01:07:24.262
Your words fall,
mine must climb.

01:07:24.346 --> 01:07:27.432
Then perhaps
I should come down to you.

01:07:27.515 --> 01:07:28.600
No.
No.

01:07:30.894 --> 01:07:33.104
Why not?

01:07:33.188 --> 01:07:35.732
I like this way
of talking.

01:07:35.815 --> 01:07:37.984
I like being invisible
to each other.

01:07:39.653 --> 01:07:43.823
I cannot be stunned into silence
by your beauty.

01:07:43.907 --> 01:07:48.537
Here in this awkwardness, I am
free at last to speak from my heart.

01:07:49.538 --> 01:07:51.623
Why is your voice
an octave lower?

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.629
I'm daring
to be myself.

01:08:00.423 --> 01:08:03.426
Why would you fear
to be yourself?

01:08:04.386 --> 01:08:05.387
To be laughed at.

01:08:06.012 --> 01:08:07.264
For what?

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.185
For having
too much emotion.

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:13.270
I do not look...

01:08:14.563 --> 01:08:16.439
Speak as I feel.

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:19.901
<i>The way I feel is like</i>

01:08:21.903 --> 01:08:25.198
<i>Falling stars</i>

01:08:25.282 --> 01:08:31.496
<i>Diving into</i>
<i>cold ocean waves</i>

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:37.836
<i>Words can only</i>
<i>get me so far</i>

01:08:37.919 --> 01:08:40.964
<i>But they cannot describe</i>

01:08:41.046 --> 01:08:43.508
<i>The way that it hurts</i>

01:08:44.593 --> 01:08:48.805
<i>'Cause every time</i>
<i>I see you</i>

01:08:48.889 --> 01:08:54.019
<i>I am overcome</i>

01:08:54.935 --> 01:08:57.522
<i>I try to tell you</i>

01:08:57.606 --> 01:09:01.026
<i>Tell you</i>
<i>how much I need you</i>

01:09:03.612 --> 01:09:06.948
<i>But I turn and run</i>

01:09:10.243 --> 01:09:16.374
<i>Your letters to me</i>
<i>are like music</i>

01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:22.380
<i>They're just a mask in a</i>
<i>lonely coward's game</i>

01:09:22.464 --> 01:09:29.011
<i>What is it</i>
<i>you're so afraid of losing?</i>

01:09:29.095 --> 01:09:36.394
-<i>That I might lose everything</i>
-<i>if I lose the pain</i>

01:09:36.478 --> 01:09:40.649
- <i>'Cause every time</i>
-<i>I see you</i>

01:09:40.732 --> 01:09:45.487
<i>I am overcome</i>

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:50.742
<i>It'd make you laugh to</i>
<i>think someone like me</i>

01:09:50.825 --> 01:09:54.287
<i>Could keep someone like you</i>

01:09:55.997 --> 01:09:59.000
<i>Look what I've become</i>

01:10:01.711 --> 01:10:05.215
<i>You wore your hair down</i>
<i>one time last spring</i>

01:10:05.298 --> 01:10:06.841
<i>In the chapel</i>

01:10:08.301 --> 01:10:10.679
<i>Your lips painted red</i>

01:10:10.762 --> 01:10:13.306
<i>I remember the day</i>

01:10:14.516 --> 01:10:16.309
<i>We hadn't met yet</i>

01:10:16.393 --> 01:10:21.273
<i>How could you possibly</i>
<i>remember that?</i>

01:10:21.356 --> 01:10:23.275
<i>You watched me then</i>

01:10:23.358 --> 01:10:28.238
<i>Why didn't you say</i>
<i>something?</i>

01:10:28.321 --> 01:10:32.492
<i>'Cause every time I see you</i>

01:10:32.576 --> 01:10:37.372
<i>I am overcome</i>

01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:41.459
<i>I try to tell you</i>

01:10:41.543 --> 01:10:45.714
<i>Tell you how much</i>
<i>I need you, too</i>

01:10:48.049 --> 01:10:50.594
<i>But look what I've become</i>

01:10:52.721 --> 01:10:59.477
<i>Nothing feels real anymore</i>
<i>when you're not around me</i>

01:10:59.561 --> 01:11:04.191
<i>Even the sky looks like</i>
<i>it's behind glass</i>

01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:07.652
<i>Hearing your voice now</i>

01:11:07.736 --> 01:11:11.823
<i>I can see everything clearly</i>

01:11:11.907 --> 01:11:17.996
<i>I can see that you really</i>
<i>are my love at last</i>

01:11:18.079 --> 01:11:23.293
<i>But, oh, Roxanne</i>

01:11:24.586 --> 01:11:26.838
<i>I'm right here, love</i>

01:11:26.922 --> 01:11:30.217
<i>Words fail me</i>

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.261
<i>Please come to me</i>

01:11:33.345 --> 01:11:37.390
<i>I try, but I can't</i>

01:11:37.474 --> 01:11:39.518
<i>This is real love</i>

01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:42.938
<i>Dare to believe</i>
<i>you'd have me</i>

01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:46.399
<i>I have no doubt</i>

01:11:46.483 --> 01:11:49.110
<i>I know that</i>
<i>you're the one now</i>

01:11:50.028 --> 01:11:52.739
<i>You don't know anything</i>

01:11:52.822 --> 01:11:56.034
<i>I know that it's you</i>

01:11:56.117 --> 01:11:57.619
<i>Roxanne, if this was true</i>

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.165
<i>Just tell me</i>
<i>what you need now</i>

01:12:02.249 --> 01:12:05.377
<i>Then I'd need for nothing</i>

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:09.965
<i>Just tell me what to do</i>

01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:12.300
Give me a kiss.

01:12:12.592 --> 01:12:13.593
No!

01:12:15.136 --> 01:12:18.932
Yes, I asked for a kiss,
but I was too bold!

01:12:19.015 --> 01:12:20.058
You don't insist?

01:12:20.141 --> 01:12:21.226
Yes.

01:12:21.309 --> 01:12:22.644
No.
Be quiet.

01:12:24.688 --> 01:12:26.147
You were speaking of a kiss.

01:12:28.692 --> 01:12:30.777
Yes, what is a kiss?

01:12:30.861 --> 01:12:33.530
Surely, you know.

01:12:33.613 --> 01:12:35.073
I meant metaphorically.

01:12:36.032 --> 01:12:37.742
Is it a vow, a promise...

01:12:37.826 --> 01:12:39.244
a confession...

01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:40.787
a secret...

01:12:40.871 --> 01:12:42.622
a moment of eternity...

01:12:43.665 --> 01:12:46.251
a communion,
a heartbeat?

01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:48.169
No more metaphors.

01:12:48.253 --> 01:12:50.380
Come claim your kiss.

01:12:50.463 --> 01:12:52.424
Literally.

01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:06.730
Go to her.

01:13:13.028 --> 01:13:14.863
It seems wrong now.

01:13:15.739 --> 01:13:17.115
She wants you.

01:14:47.622 --> 01:14:50.041
Which house belongs
to Miss Roxanne?

01:14:50.125 --> 01:14:51.209
Who wants to know?

01:14:51.293 --> 01:14:52.919
I have a letter for her.
From whom?

01:14:53.003 --> 01:14:55.589
It's confidential
and urgent.

01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.342
Miss Roxanne...

01:14:59.426 --> 01:15:03.221
the noble Duke de Guiche asked
me in specific, as it is a holy matter...

01:15:03.305 --> 01:15:05.724
to bring that letter
directly to you.

01:15:11.146 --> 01:15:16.735
- <i>My dearest, I have sent a holy man to you</i>
-<i>with a choice.</i>

01:15:16.818 --> 01:15:20.530
<i>You have declared</i>
<i>your love for me...</i>

01:15:20.614 --> 01:15:26.912
<i>and I can no longer wait</i>
<i>to enjoy your treasures.</i>

01:15:26.995 --> 01:15:29.122
<i>I'm on my way to you.</i>

01:15:29.206 --> 01:15:32.125
<i>If you keep the priest there,</i>
<i>I will marry you.</i>

01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:35.086
<i>If you send him away...</i>

01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:39.966
<i>we shall consummate our love</i>
<i>without the bonds of vows.</i>

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:42.135
<i>Your choice.</i>

01:15:42.219 --> 01:15:43.803
<i>Either way...</i>

01:15:43.887 --> 01:15:47.224
<i>I will possess you tonight.</i>

01:16:05.408 --> 01:16:06.701
All well?

01:16:24.386 --> 01:16:27.472
Miss Roxanne,
what does it say?

01:16:29.724 --> 01:16:35.814
This letter is delivered into
your hands by a saintly...

01:16:35.897 --> 01:16:39.109
and extremely discreet priest.

01:16:40.193 --> 01:16:41.653
Inform him...

01:16:41.736 --> 01:16:42.821
Roxanne?

01:16:42.904 --> 01:16:46.491
...that it is
the Cardinal's will...

01:16:46.575 --> 01:16:50.328
that he give the blessing
of holy matrimony...

01:16:50.412 --> 01:16:53.832
in secret and without delay
in your home...

01:16:53.915 --> 01:16:55.292
to you...

01:17:06.303 --> 01:17:07.679
and Christian Neuvillette.

01:17:08.763 --> 01:17:10.181
What?

01:17:10.265 --> 01:17:14.519
 I told you it was a holy
matter from a worthy lord.

01:17:14.603 --> 01:17:18.023
Is this okay with you, my love?
Nothing could make me happier.

01:17:20.692 --> 01:17:21.776
It says we must hurry.

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:22.944
Roxanne?

01:17:26.615 --> 01:17:27.616
Yes?

01:17:30.076 --> 01:17:32.537
De Guiche is
on his way here.

01:17:32.621 --> 01:17:34.623
Then you will delay him.

01:17:39.419 --> 01:17:40.712
 Thank you.

01:17:40.795 --> 01:17:42.797
Thank you.
I could not be happier.

01:17:49.054 --> 01:17:50.639
You don't know
what you're in for.

01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:58.855
<i>I deserve a little kindness</i>

01:17:58.939 --> 01:18:01.900
<i>I deserve my due respect</i>

01:18:01.983 --> 01:18:04.736
<i>I deserve to be beloved</i>

01:18:04.819 --> 01:18:09.241
<i>Just like everybody else</i>

01:18:09.324 --> 01:18:12.035
<i>I deserve my place in heaven</i>

01:18:12.118 --> 01:18:15.205
<i>I deserve an equal share</i>

01:18:15.288 --> 01:18:17.749
<i>I deserve my rightful cut</i>

01:18:17.832 --> 01:18:21.378
<i>Of everything everywhere</i>

01:18:22.837 --> 01:18:24.422
<i>God, Roxanne</i>

01:18:24.506 --> 01:18:28.009
<i>Am I asking for too much?</i>

01:18:28.093 --> 01:18:34.224
<i>Why should I have to beg</i>
<i>for what everybody wants?</i>

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.018
<i>Take me right now</i>

01:18:37.102 --> 01:18:39.479
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>if I have your love</i>

01:18:39.563 --> 01:18:41.606
<i>I'll have no fear</i>

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:44.067
<i>Nothing's even</i>
<i>nothing's fair</i>

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:47.153
<i>Roxanne, I didn't</i>
<i>ask to be here</i>

01:18:47.237 --> 01:18:50.448
<i>I'll pick the lock</i>
<i>I'll draw the knife</i>

01:18:50.532 --> 01:18:53.618
<i>I'll climb the wall</i>
<i>I'll crash the gate</i>

01:18:53.702 --> 01:18:56.788
<i>'Cause I deserve</i>
<i>a happy life</i>

01:18:56.872 --> 01:19:01.668
<i>Whatever I'm not given</i>
<i>I'll take</i>

01:19:01.751 --> 01:19:03.253
"Love is patient.

01:19:03.336 --> 01:19:04.880
<i>God, Roxanne...</i>
"Love is kind.

01:19:04.963 --> 01:19:06.548
<i>...am I asking...</i>
"It does not envy.

01:19:06.631 --> 01:19:08.633
-<i>...for too much?</i> "It
does not boast. -It is not proud."

01:19:08.717 --> 01:19:14.639
<i>Why should I have to beg</i>
<i>for what everybody wants?</i>

01:19:14.723 --> 01:19:17.267
<i>"It keeps no record of wrongs.</i>

01:19:19.603 --> 01:19:23.440
"In sickness and in health,
until death do you part."

01:19:23.523 --> 01:19:25.150
I do.

01:19:25.233 --> 01:19:26.735
"Roxanne...

01:19:26.818 --> 01:19:29.821
"do you take Christian
for your lawful husband...

01:19:29.905 --> 01:19:32.824
"to have and to hold
from this day forward?"

01:19:35.619 --> 01:19:38.997
<i>I deserve a little kindness</i>

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.541
<i>I deserve my due respect</i>
Roxanne...

01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:44.544
-<i>I deserve to be
beloved</i> ...receive this ring -as a sign of my love...

01:19:44.628 --> 01:19:47.923
<i>Just like everybody else</i>
...and fidelity.

01:19:48.006 --> 01:19:50.842
<i>God gave me</i>
<i>the life I'm living</i>

01:19:50.926 --> 01:19:54.304
<i>You better make no mistake</i>

01:19:54.387 --> 01:19:57.015
<i>I deserve to be forgiven</i>

01:19:57.098 --> 01:19:59.684
<i>Whatever I'm not given</i>

01:19:59.768 --> 01:20:06.775
<i>I'll take</i>

01:20:14.241 --> 01:20:16.284
Do you know
what's happened in there?

01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:18.828
The slut.

01:20:25.418 --> 01:20:27.379
She's married a guard.

01:20:33.134 --> 01:20:35.595
She's insane.

01:20:45.522 --> 01:20:47.983
I'm through with love.

01:20:48.066 --> 01:20:50.318
Does one nothing but harm.

01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:58.618
I'm going back in there.

01:21:01.079 --> 01:21:02.080
Attention.

01:21:02.998 --> 01:21:04.624
You, get out of here.

01:21:04.708 --> 01:21:06.793
You, I don't want to
see your face.

01:21:06.877 --> 01:21:08.545
Neuvillette.
Sir.

01:21:08.628 --> 01:21:11.172
Your regiment leaves
for the war tonight.

01:21:11.256 --> 01:21:18.096
You are to depart for the front
at once and deliver these orders immediately.

01:21:18.179 --> 01:21:21.099
You promised the guards
would not be sent to the front.

01:21:21.182 --> 01:21:22.184
 Promises?

01:21:23.435 --> 01:21:24.644
Say goodbye
to your husband.

01:21:24.728 --> 01:21:26.563
Do you mean to
make me a widow?

01:21:26.646 --> 01:21:28.565
 Only God knows.

01:21:30.567 --> 01:21:31.985
 Christian.

01:21:32.068 --> 01:21:33.111
Christian.

01:21:33.195 --> 01:21:34.279
Christian.

01:21:40.035 --> 01:21:43.205
Come, Christian. We must go.

01:21:43.288 --> 01:21:46.958
Roxanne, I love you,
and I will return to you.

01:21:53.924 --> 01:21:54.925
Enough.

01:22:04.976 --> 01:22:05.977
Cyrano.

01:22:07.687 --> 01:22:10.774
Promise me
he will not be cold or hungry.

01:22:10.857 --> 01:22:12.859
I can't promise that.

01:22:12.943 --> 01:22:15.153
Promise me
he will be faithful.

01:22:15.237 --> 01:22:17.614
Of course he will,
but I cannot promise you.

01:22:20.325 --> 01:22:22.536
Promise me...

01:22:22.619 --> 01:22:23.870
he will write.

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:30.544
That I can promise you.

01:22:59.197 --> 01:23:04.202
- <i>How is it I feel</i>
-<i>you closer to me</i>

01:23:04.286 --> 01:23:08.665
<i>Now that the world's</i>
<i>between us?</i>

01:23:08.748 --> 01:23:14.254
<i>What I wouldn't do just to</i>
<i>get some sleep</i>

01:23:14.337 --> 01:23:18.675
<i>But we're taking fire</i>
<i>But we're taking fire</i>

01:23:18.758 --> 01:23:24.389
<i>There are some things that</i>
<i>my mind can't do</i>

01:23:24.472 --> 01:23:28.560
<i>The machine takes over</i>
<i>The machine takes over</i>

01:23:28.643 --> 01:23:34.107
<i>I'd kill the world to get</i>
<i>back home to you</i>

01:23:34.191 --> 01:23:38.945
<i>But I'm getting tired</i>
<i>But I'm getting tired</i>

01:23:39.029 --> 01:23:42.199
<i>If I close my eyes maybe</i>
<i>I'll see you there</i>

01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:47.204
<i>One more time</i>

01:23:48.413 --> 01:23:51.416
<i>And I will</i>
<i>give you my word</i>

01:23:51.499 --> 01:23:57.047
<i>I'm so afraid you won't</i>
<i>believe it</i>

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.968
<i>And if I told you</i>
<i>all I've done</i>

01:24:02.052 --> 01:24:06.598
<i>I know it'd make you cry</i>

01:24:08.183 --> 01:24:13.063
<i>So I will close my eyes</i>
<i>And let the falling skies</i>

01:24:13.146 --> 01:24:16.816
<i>Lay down between us</i>
<i>Lay down between us</i>

01:24:18.235 --> 01:24:22.822
<i>I will close my eyes</i>
<i>And let the falling skies</i>

01:24:22.906 --> 01:24:26.618
<i>Lay down between us</i>
<i>Lay down between us</i>

01:25:14.958 --> 01:25:17.878
 Friendly!
Friendly coming through.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.133
Cyrano.

01:25:38.315 --> 01:25:40.609
Every morning,
they shoot.

01:25:40.692 --> 01:25:43.695
And every morning,
they miss.

01:25:43.778 --> 01:25:45.697
And one morning,
they'll get lucky.

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:48.074
You're risking your life
to send a letter.

01:25:49.492 --> 01:25:51.912
I promised her
he would write.

01:25:58.168 --> 01:26:00.086
<i>It's a suicide mission.</i>

01:26:01.546 --> 01:26:05.634
Those orders from the King
command me to decide...

01:26:05.717 --> 01:26:08.553
which of my units
must perish.

01:26:09.721 --> 01:26:12.015
<i>Do I send</i>
<i>the most expendable?</i>

01:26:12.098 --> 01:26:13.642
Where are you going?

01:26:13.725 --> 01:26:15.268
To write a letter.

01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:17.812
Or the bravest?

01:26:29.908 --> 01:26:30.951
The guards.

01:26:32.827 --> 01:26:34.079
Make out the orders...

01:26:35.205 --> 01:26:38.875
to Captain Le Bret
immediately.

01:26:38.959 --> 01:26:41.169
<i>We'll let God</i>
<i>decide the rest.</i>

01:26:51.846 --> 01:26:54.724
I take no pleasure
in this.

01:26:57.227 --> 01:26:59.145
I serve my King.

01:27:00.313 --> 01:27:01.982
Not my spite.

01:27:03.567 --> 01:27:04.860
 Form break.

01:27:04.943 --> 01:27:06.653
 Present arms.
 Platoons! Get ready.

01:27:06.736 --> 01:27:10.031
Platoon commanders,
steady your men!

01:27:12.784 --> 01:27:14.536
 <i>Form line!</i>

01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:19.624
This child has delivered our
orders from the King.

01:27:23.962 --> 01:27:25.088
These are from de Guiche.

01:27:25.171 --> 01:27:27.132
Correct.
In service of the King.

01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:30.510
We've been holding this
godforsaken rock for months.

01:27:30.594 --> 01:27:32.304
On the King's orders.

01:27:32.387 --> 01:27:35.265
And now we have the noble
distinction of being chosen to mount an attack.

01:27:36.892 --> 01:27:38.185
De Guiche wants me dead.

01:27:38.268 --> 01:27:39.978
The odds are against us.

01:27:43.064 --> 01:27:45.650
I'd rather die down there
fighting...

01:27:45.734 --> 01:27:47.277
than starve up here waiting.

01:27:49.196 --> 01:27:50.530
Then ready yourself.

01:27:55.368 --> 01:27:56.786
 Form line!

01:27:59.372 --> 01:28:01.249
Captain, steady your men!

01:28:02.167 --> 01:28:04.252
Collect the letters.

01:28:13.929 --> 01:28:16.306
<i>I have a wife</i>

01:28:16.389 --> 01:28:18.934
<i>I haven't seen</i>

01:28:19.017 --> 01:28:22.229
<i>Since lilacs bloomed</i>
<i>in Saint-Hippolyte</i>

01:28:23.813 --> 01:28:25.649
<i>She always wears them</i>

01:28:26.566 --> 01:28:28.777
<i>In her hair</i>

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:32.864
<i>And she lets them fall down</i>
<i>everywhere</i>

01:28:32.948 --> 01:28:38.328
<i>I can see her</i>
<i>in the glowing light</i>

01:28:38.411 --> 01:28:41.748
<i>Dressing without a sound</i>

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:47.504
<i>I promised</i>
<i>I'd be home all right</i>

01:28:47.587 --> 01:28:52.133
<i>But I gotta</i>
<i>lay this body down</i>

01:28:53.969 --> 01:28:56.513
<i>So take this letter</i>

01:28:56.596 --> 01:28:58.890
<i>To my wife</i>

01:28:58.974 --> 01:29:02.060
<i>And tell her that</i>
<i>I loved my life</i>

01:29:04.062 --> 01:29:06.189
<i>And tell my boys</i>

01:29:06.273 --> 01:29:08.900
<i>The Lord, he found me</i>

01:29:08.984 --> 01:29:11.152
<i>When I say</i>
<i>their names out loud</i>

01:29:11.236 --> 01:29:13.154
<i>They're all around me</i>

01:29:13.238 --> 01:29:14.447
<i>And tell 'em</i>

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:20.537
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

01:29:23.623 --> 01:29:26.543
<i>Heaven</i>

01:29:26.626 --> 01:29:30.881
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:29:33.884 --> 01:29:36.386
<i>I have a girl</i>

01:29:36.469 --> 01:29:38.054
<i>I think I love her</i>

01:29:39.097 --> 01:29:40.849
<i>I should have told her</i>

01:29:40.932 --> 01:29:42.851
<i>Instead I told her mother</i>

01:29:44.019 --> 01:29:46.563
<i>I gave her chocolates</i>

01:29:46.646 --> 01:29:47.814
<i>I bought a ring</i>

01:29:49.024 --> 01:29:52.944
<i>But I never told her</i>
<i>anything</i>

01:29:53.028 --> 01:29:58.575
<i>But I can see her</i>
<i>in every detail now</i>

01:29:58.658 --> 01:30:02.078
<i>Turning in my mind</i>

01:30:03.496 --> 01:30:07.667
<i>I barely knew</i>
<i>that girl at all</i>

01:30:07.751 --> 01:30:10.587
<i>But I will love her till</i>
<i>the end of time</i>

01:30:14.049 --> 01:30:16.593
<i>So take this letter</i>

01:30:16.676 --> 01:30:19.054
<i>To my girl</i>

01:30:19.137 --> 01:30:23.767
<i>Tell her that I saw</i>
<i>the whole world</i>

01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:28.438
<i>Say that right before I fell</i>

01:30:28.522 --> 01:30:30.774
<i>I said her name out loud</i>

01:30:31.942 --> 01:30:33.485
<i>Isabelle</i>

01:30:33.568 --> 01:30:35.612
<i>And tell her</i>

01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:40.242
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

01:30:43.787 --> 01:30:46.790
<i>Heaven</i>

01:30:46.873 --> 01:30:50.544
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:30:54.089 --> 01:30:55.715
<i>I have a father</i>

01:30:56.633 --> 01:30:57.801
<i>He isn't well</i>

01:30:59.261 --> 01:31:02.722
<i>He thinks he might be</i>
<i>going to hell</i>

01:31:04.182 --> 01:31:05.684
<i>He was a sinner</i>

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.978
<i>He liked to fight</i>

01:31:09.354 --> 01:31:13.108
<i>So I don't know</i>
<i>he might be right</i>

01:31:13.191 --> 01:31:18.488
<i>I can see him</i>
<i>every Sunday morning</i>

01:31:18.572 --> 01:31:22.117
<i>Diving into the fray</i>

01:31:23.535 --> 01:31:28.290
<i>He wasn't</i>
<i>one of God's best men</i>

01:31:28.373 --> 01:31:32.460
<i>But I loved him anyway</i>

01:31:34.170 --> 01:31:35.589
<i>So take this letter</i>

01:31:36.923 --> 01:31:39.384
<i>To him, please</i>

01:31:39.467 --> 01:31:42.929
<i>And tell him I can't wait</i>
<i>to see him</i>

01:31:44.222 --> 01:31:45.599
<i>I went in first</i>

01:31:46.725 --> 01:31:49.227
<i>I rang the bell</i>

01:31:49.311 --> 01:31:53.023
<i>I called his name out loud</i>
<i>and I gave 'em hell</i>

01:31:53.106 --> 01:31:54.774
<i>So tell him</i>

01:31:56.943 --> 01:32:00.614
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

01:32:03.867 --> 01:32:06.870
<i>Heaven</i>

01:32:06.953 --> 01:32:10.415
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:32:13.668 --> 01:32:14.669
<i>Tell 'em</i>

01:32:16.796 --> 01:32:21.051
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

01:32:23.762 --> 01:32:26.723
<i>Heaven</i>

01:32:26.806 --> 01:32:30.685
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:32:33.522 --> 01:32:34.606
<i>Tell 'em</i>

01:32:34.689 --> 01:32:35.815
Roxanne.

01:32:36.816 --> 01:32:39.611
<i>Not to cry at all</i>
I know.

01:32:39.694 --> 01:32:41.696
I wish I could
write her one last letter.

01:32:43.615 --> 01:32:45.909
You have.
<i>Heaven</i>

01:32:45.992 --> 01:32:47.077
Let me see.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.745
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:32:48.828 --> 01:32:50.455
No need.

01:32:50.539 --> 01:32:52.082
Of course
there's a need.

01:33:09.015 --> 01:33:10.475
What's this?

01:33:10.559 --> 01:33:11.810
What?

01:33:11.893 --> 01:33:13.562
This.

01:33:13.645 --> 01:33:14.771
It's a tear stain.

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.481
Is it? That's odd.

01:33:19.568 --> 01:33:23.363
We poets sometimes are so moved
by our own creations that we...

01:33:23.446 --> 01:33:24.489
It's poetic empathy.

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:27.659
You cried
writing this letter?

01:33:30.287 --> 01:33:33.290
Yes. I cannot
bear not to see her again.

01:33:35.834 --> 01:33:37.419
We will never
see her again.

01:33:37.502 --> 01:33:41.506
You, her beloved husband, might
die and never see her again.

01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:42.883
That is the tear stain.

01:33:45.051 --> 01:33:46.344
You're in love
with her.

01:33:46.428 --> 01:33:47.429
What?

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.765
You've gone mad.
You're starving.

01:33:50.849 --> 01:33:52.392
Deny it then.

01:33:53.768 --> 01:33:54.936
Do you love her?

01:33:59.399 --> 01:34:00.775
It's too simple.

01:34:04.154 --> 01:34:05.405
I knew it.

01:34:06.781 --> 01:34:08.783
But I didn't...

01:34:08.867 --> 01:34:10.869
I didn't dare
let myself believe it.

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:13.079
I feel sick.

01:34:13.163 --> 01:34:14.998
You've always loved her.
I will deny it.

01:34:15.081 --> 01:34:16.708
You can't deny it.
You can't even hide it.

01:34:16.791 --> 01:34:18.418
Christian, listen to me.

01:34:18.501 --> 01:34:20.420
If I should die and you should
live, and she mentions the letters...

01:34:20.503 --> 01:34:22.172
do not be surprised...
At what?

01:34:22.255 --> 01:34:24.007
If she mentions
their volume.

01:34:24.090 --> 01:34:26.009
You've written to her
more often than you know.

01:34:26.092 --> 01:34:28.094
How often?
Often enough.

01:34:28.178 --> 01:34:29.804
Twice a week?
More.

01:34:29.888 --> 01:34:31.556
Three times a week?
More than that.

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:33.391
Four? Five?
More.

01:34:33.475 --> 01:34:34.935
Every day?
Yes, every day.

01:35:03.838 --> 01:35:05.632
She doesn't love me.

01:35:05.715 --> 01:35:08.051
Of course she does.

01:35:08.134 --> 01:35:11.054
In her most recent letter,
she said she loves me...

01:35:11.137 --> 01:35:12.472
because of my soul.

01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:14.891
What could be
more loving?

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:16.518
You are my soul!

01:35:22.232 --> 01:35:23.608
We have to
tell her the truth...

01:35:24.776 --> 01:35:26.945
and you must
confess your love.

01:35:27.028 --> 01:35:29.239
The world will never
accept a midget...

01:35:29.322 --> 01:35:31.241
and a tall
beautiful woman.

01:35:31.324 --> 01:35:33.785
Never mind the world.
What about Roxanne?

01:35:35.245 --> 01:35:37.956
She's got a huge heart.

01:35:38.039 --> 01:35:41.960
In the same letter, she
reassured me that she'd still love me...

01:35:42.043 --> 01:35:45.255
even if I return
from this hell a broken man...

01:35:45.338 --> 01:35:47.465
disfigured and
body destroyed.

01:35:47.549 --> 01:35:48.800
She said that?

01:36:05.775 --> 01:36:06.818
Don't believe her.

01:36:06.902 --> 01:36:08.153
Don't doubt her.

01:36:09.613 --> 01:36:11.823
Take your positions!

01:36:14.451 --> 01:36:15.660
We have betrayed her.

01:36:15.744 --> 01:36:17.454
We can never tell her.
It'll break her heart.

01:36:17.537 --> 01:36:18.830
We have to tell her.

01:36:18.914 --> 01:36:20.665
It's our moral...

01:36:20.749 --> 01:36:21.917
Our moral...

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:24.836
Obligation.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.004
See you on the other side!

01:36:26.087 --> 01:36:28.006
We must let her
decide our fate.

01:36:28.089 --> 01:36:30.926
One of us,
none of us...

01:36:31.009 --> 01:36:32.844
She must have
the choice.

01:36:32.928 --> 01:36:34.554
 Form the line!

01:36:36.765 --> 01:36:39.476
And I'm certain
she'll choose you.

01:36:39.559 --> 01:36:40.936
She's already
chosen you.

01:36:41.019 --> 01:36:42.771
Love at first sight.
She married you.

01:36:42.854 --> 01:36:44.481
She doesn't love me.
She doesn't even know me.

01:36:44.564 --> 01:36:45.941
She doesn't
love me either.

01:36:46.024 --> 01:36:47.943
I think she does.

01:36:48.026 --> 01:36:50.946
And I would prefer to be loved
for my true self or not at all.

01:36:52.948 --> 01:36:54.407
 Get ready!

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.326
Christian.

01:36:56.409 --> 01:36:58.119
 Attention!

01:36:58.203 --> 01:36:59.496
<i>Tell 'em</i>

01:36:59.579 --> 01:37:01.331
See you on the other side!

01:37:01.414 --> 01:37:05.293
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

01:37:08.505 --> 01:37:10.590
<i>Heaven</i>

01:37:11.424 --> 01:37:15.762
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:37:15.845 --> 01:37:18.306
 Soldier, back in line!

01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:19.891
<i>Tell 'em</i>

01:37:19.975 --> 01:37:21.351
Soldier!

01:37:21.434 --> 01:37:25.856
<i>Not to cry at all</i>
Christian! No!

01:37:28.441 --> 01:37:31.069
<i>Heaven</i>

01:37:31.152 --> 01:37:36.074
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:38:08.815 --> 01:38:10.275
You will live.

01:38:12.277 --> 01:38:16.907
You will live for Roxanne
who loves you.

01:38:21.286 --> 01:38:23.830
Tell her everything.

01:38:23.914 --> 01:38:24.915
Please.

01:38:26.917 --> 01:38:28.126
Everything.

01:38:33.048 --> 01:38:34.549
Roxanne.

01:38:39.763 --> 01:38:41.139
 Forward!

01:38:41.223 --> 01:38:44.768
Forward! Forward! Forward!

01:38:51.316 --> 01:38:52.526
<i>Tell 'em</i>

01:38:54.402 --> 01:38:58.615
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

01:39:01.409 --> 01:39:04.538
<i>Heaven</i>

01:39:04.621 --> 01:39:08.875
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:39:10.961 --> 01:39:12.337
<i>Tell 'em</i>

01:39:14.172 --> 01:39:18.426
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

01:39:19.594 --> 01:39:24.057
Make ready! And fire!
<i>Heaven</i>

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:28.186
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:39:30.355 --> 01:39:31.690
 Fire!
<i>Tell 'em</i>

01:39:33.817 --> 01:39:38.029
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

01:39:38.113 --> 01:39:39.364
Fire!

01:39:40.615 --> 01:39:43.743
<i>Heaven</i>

01:39:43.827 --> 01:39:48.748
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

01:39:56.381 --> 01:40:01.219
Sister Claire, must I remind
you, you have accepted a life without mirrors?

01:40:01.303 --> 01:40:02.888
Stop admiring yourself...

01:40:02.971 --> 01:40:04.723
or I will be forced
to tell Cyrano.

01:40:04.806 --> 01:40:07.017
Oh, no.
He'll make such fun of me.

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:10.729
And promise me you will stop
trying to convert him.

01:40:10.812 --> 01:40:14.024
He's been coming here every
Saturday for as long as I can remember.

01:40:14.858 --> 01:40:16.776
Why does he
not believe?

01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:18.737
Miss Roxanne
is his faith.

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:21.323
His weekly visits
are his service.

01:40:21.406 --> 01:40:23.742
It saddens me
he won't see heaven.

01:40:23.825 --> 01:40:26.411
I'm sure the Lord
has a plan for him.

01:40:26.494 --> 01:40:29.122
You should worry about
his remaining time on Earth.

01:40:29.206 --> 01:40:30.916
Get him to eat.

01:40:30.999 --> 01:40:33.251
He always says
he's not hungry.

01:40:33.335 --> 01:40:35.503
He says,
"I ate good meat yesterday."

01:40:35.587 --> 01:40:37.339
It's not true.

01:40:37.422 --> 01:40:39.966
He's too proud
to admit he can't afford it.

01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:41.593
He's starving.

01:40:41.676 --> 01:40:43.595
Insist he eats with us
this evening.

01:40:43.678 --> 01:40:45.096
Yes, Mother.

01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:47.224
He'll be here at six o'clock to
bring her the news.

01:40:51.061 --> 01:40:52.103
<i>Dear Roxanne...</i>

01:40:52.187 --> 01:40:53.980
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

01:40:54.064 --> 01:40:56.441
<i>...how many times have I</i>
<i>sat by your side and wanted to tell you?</i>

01:40:56.525 --> 01:40:57.567
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:58.652
<i>Almost told you?</i>

01:40:58.735 --> 01:40:59.903
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

01:40:59.986 --> 01:41:01.613
<i>There is nothing</i>
<i>so dangerous and sweet...</i>

01:41:01.696 --> 01:41:03.365
<i>to keep as</i>
<i>a secret like this.</i>

01:41:03.448 --> 01:41:05.534
<i>I have sublimated.</i>

01:41:05.617 --> 01:41:07.160
<i>Tell her. Tell her.</i>

01:41:07.244 --> 01:41:08.787
<i>How many letters</i>
<i>have I written...</i>

01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:09.913
<i>Tell her.</i>

01:41:09.996 --> 01:41:10.997
<i>Trying to spell it out plainly.</i>

01:41:11.081 --> 01:41:12.165
Plainly.

01:41:12.249 --> 01:41:13.458
<i>Simply.</i>

01:41:14.376 --> 01:41:15.418
Simply.

01:41:18.004 --> 01:41:19.464
Without art.

01:41:22.384 --> 01:41:23.385
Ob...

01:41:42.737 --> 01:41:44.406
<i>Tell her the truth.</i>

01:41:44.489 --> 01:41:46.658
<i>You. Always you.</i>

01:41:46.741 --> 01:41:47.993
<i>You. You.</i>

01:41:48.076 --> 01:41:49.995
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

01:41:50.078 --> 01:41:51.955
<i>Tell her. Tell her.</i>

01:41:52.038 --> 01:41:54.749
<i>I will die loving you,</i>
<i>and you will never know.</i>

01:41:54.833 --> 01:41:56.251
<i>Tell her.</i>

01:42:42.172 --> 01:42:43.798
He'll be here.

01:42:43.882 --> 01:42:45.884
He's always on time.

01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:50.680
Going somewhere?

01:42:53.308 --> 01:42:54.392
You're late.

01:42:54.476 --> 01:42:55.977
I was delayed.

01:42:56.978 --> 01:42:58.063
By what?

01:42:58.146 --> 01:42:59.689
An untimely visitor.

01:43:03.902 --> 01:43:05.362
You sent him away?

01:43:07.656 --> 01:43:12.285
I fear I only
put him off for a short while.

01:43:12.369 --> 01:43:14.412
Well, he will
have to wait...

01:43:14.496 --> 01:43:18.041
because I will not
let you leave before nightfall.

01:43:18.124 --> 01:43:19.376
You've cut yourself.

01:43:20.835 --> 01:43:23.171
A scratch, really.

01:43:26.091 --> 01:43:28.260
Aren't you going to
tease Sister Claire?

01:43:28.343 --> 01:43:30.470
She waits for it
all week, you know.

01:43:32.389 --> 01:43:34.474
Sister Claire,
you have such lovely eyes.

01:43:34.558 --> 01:43:36.309
Why do you keep them
cast down?

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:39.563
I ate good meat
yesterday.

01:43:40.939 --> 01:43:43.024
When you're ready,
come to the dining hall.

01:43:43.108 --> 01:43:44.693
Then I'll give you
a big bowl of soup.

01:43:44.776 --> 01:43:46.319
Yes.
Good.

01:43:46.403 --> 01:43:49.030
I think Sister Claire
is trying to convert you.

01:43:49.114 --> 01:43:50.115
I am not.

01:43:50.782 --> 01:43:52.117
Mother warned me off.

01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:56.371
Sister Claire.

01:43:57.956 --> 01:44:00.709
Tonight, I will let you
pray for me.

01:44:02.878 --> 01:44:05.171
I have not waited
for your permission.

01:44:17.058 --> 01:44:19.227
Do you remember
the day we first met?

01:44:22.731 --> 01:44:23.815
Yes.

01:44:25.901 --> 01:44:28.195
It was early morning
in early June.

01:44:29.613 --> 01:44:32.324
I'd come to borrow a book
from your father.

01:44:32.407 --> 01:44:37.829
We found you curled up on the
floor in the library in the dawn light...

01:44:37.913 --> 01:44:40.999
a tome for a pillow.

01:44:41.082 --> 01:44:44.002
You were reading
the very book that I'd come for.

01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:46.713
I refused to give it up.

01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:50.717
Your youth
made it forgivable.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.469
I hadn't finished
reading it.

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:54.179
I didn't mind.

01:44:54.262 --> 01:44:56.097
You said you'd give it to me
when you had.

01:44:56.181 --> 01:44:57.432
And I did.

01:45:00.101 --> 01:45:02.646
It was as if
we'd always known each other.

01:45:04.439 --> 01:45:06.107
And now we have.

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:13.698
They say light
is the soul of a holy space.

01:45:13.782 --> 01:45:15.659
It's designed
to be enough.

01:45:17.953 --> 01:45:19.454
Enough beauty...

01:45:23.124 --> 01:45:24.834
to just let go.

01:45:30.298 --> 01:45:31.758
Are you melancholy?

01:45:33.385 --> 01:45:34.427
No.

01:45:34.511 --> 01:45:35.679
No.

01:45:43.311 --> 01:45:45.063
Do you have
my daily paper?

01:45:45.146 --> 01:45:46.439
Yes, I do.

01:45:46.523 --> 01:45:47.649
Good.

01:45:50.694 --> 01:45:53.738
Last Saturday, the 19th,
I saw you.

01:45:53.822 --> 01:45:56.157
And then a week passed in which
nothing important happened...

01:45:56.241 --> 01:45:57.325
and now here
I am again.

01:45:57.409 --> 01:45:59.160
Cyrano.
All right.

01:46:00.078 --> 01:46:01.663
The news.

01:46:11.923 --> 01:46:15.635
On Saturday, the head of state
ate too many prunes...

01:46:15.719 --> 01:46:17.929
and he took to his bed
with a fever.

01:46:18.013 --> 01:46:20.432
He was executed by his
physician...

01:46:20.515 --> 01:46:22.434
and now he is feeling
much better.

01:46:25.353 --> 01:46:27.731
There was a ball
on Sunday...

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:32.736
and 762 wax candles
were burned...

01:46:35.071 --> 01:46:36.072
out.

01:46:39.117 --> 01:46:43.830
On Monday, our troops were
reported to have beaten everyone...

01:46:43.914 --> 01:46:45.207
everywhere.

01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:53.048
On Tuesday, a tiny little dog
had to be given a very large enema.

01:47:00.931 --> 01:47:02.557
On Wednesday, nothing.

01:47:04.559 --> 01:47:07.312
On Thursday...

01:47:07.395 --> 01:47:11.483
someone somewhere,
who isn't us, took a new lover.

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:17.405
On Friday...

01:47:19.241 --> 01:47:20.909
I was the queen...

01:47:25.497 --> 01:47:26.748
of almost.

01:47:31.336 --> 01:47:32.504
Today...

01:47:37.592 --> 01:47:39.678
Today, I...

01:47:39.761 --> 01:47:40.929
I...

01:47:42.138 --> 01:47:43.515
I...

01:47:51.982 --> 01:47:53.984
Shall we get you
that soup?

01:47:58.113 --> 01:47:59.698
Not yet.

01:47:59.781 --> 01:48:00.991
Not yet.

01:48:01.825 --> 01:48:03.076
Oh, my dear.

01:48:04.369 --> 01:48:05.829
What is to be done?

01:48:07.372 --> 01:48:09.624
Just my old wound
from the war.

01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:12.752
Damn that war.

01:48:24.139 --> 01:48:27.642
You told me one day you would
let me read Christian's last letter.

01:48:31.479 --> 01:48:32.564
Now?

01:48:35.567 --> 01:48:36.568
Please.

01:49:04.512 --> 01:49:05.764
Thank you.

01:49:17.234 --> 01:49:19.611
"Farewell, Roxanne...

01:49:19.694 --> 01:49:22.697
"I believe this will be
my last day, my beloved.

01:49:24.032 --> 01:49:27.285
"My soul is heavy
with unexpressed love.

01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:32.123
"Fullness of heart
cannot be recorded.

01:49:32.207 --> 01:49:35.252
"It will not live on
in my bones when I am gone.

01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:39.798
"It will not be buried
in my grave.

01:49:41.258 --> 01:49:43.718
"The exact measure of my love
cannot be given to you...

01:49:43.802 --> 01:49:45.845
"in words to outlast
my last breath.

01:49:45.929 --> 01:49:48.139
"No matter how I wish it,
for I am dust.

01:49:48.223 --> 01:49:49.891
"And dust to dust...

01:49:51.059 --> 01:49:53.270
"I'm going to die today,
my love."

01:49:53.353 --> 01:49:54.729
You are not reading.

01:49:56.481 --> 01:49:58.108
You are remembering.

01:50:06.116 --> 01:50:07.659
It was you.

01:50:07.742 --> 01:50:08.827
No, Roxanne.

01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:11.162
Make your confession.
No, Roxanne.

01:50:11.246 --> 01:50:12.414
The letters.
No.

01:50:12.497 --> 01:50:13.582
The words.
No.

01:50:13.665 --> 01:50:15.667
The voice in the night
below my balcony.

01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:17.294
All of it. You.

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:19.296
I married him that night
because of your words.

01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:20.505
You married him,
not my words.

01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:21.756
Why are you denying it?

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.842
Because I do not love you,
my love.

01:50:24.968 --> 01:50:26.928
Yes, you do.
Christian loved you.

01:50:27.012 --> 01:50:28.680
You wrote that letter.
No.

01:50:28.763 --> 01:50:30.432
That tear is yours.
The blood is his!

01:50:30.515 --> 01:50:33.059
Why tell me now? Why?

01:50:33.143 --> 01:50:35.353
I believe this will be
my last day.

01:50:35.437 --> 01:50:36.438
No.

01:50:39.941 --> 01:50:41.026
No.

01:50:42.277 --> 01:50:43.320
No.

01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:48.033
<i>No, Cyrano</i>

01:50:48.116 --> 01:50:51.244
<i>I won't let you go</i>

01:50:51.328 --> 01:50:55.498
<i>How can you not see?</i>

01:50:56.791 --> 01:50:59.711
<i>I'm alone, Cyrano</i>

01:50:59.794 --> 01:51:03.215
<i>I've nowhere to go</i>

01:51:03.298 --> 01:51:07.719
<i>You have to stay with me</i>

01:51:09.679 --> 01:51:11.723
<i>Oh, Roxanne</i>

01:51:11.806 --> 01:51:15.101
<i>I don't understand</i>

01:51:15.185 --> 01:51:19.564
<i>The one you love's not here</i>

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:23.568
<i>I buried that man</i>

01:51:23.652 --> 01:51:26.655
<i>With my very own hands</i>

01:51:26.738 --> 01:51:31.493
<i>Long ago</i>
<i>in a blackberry field</i>

01:51:32.911 --> 01:51:37.832
- <i>Have you ever wanted</i>
-<i>something</i>

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.506
<i>So badly you cannot breathe</i>

01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:49.511
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>loved someone</i>

01:51:51.012 --> 01:51:53.306
<i>Madly</i>

01:51:57.185 --> 01:51:59.855
<i>It's okay, Roxanne</i>

01:51:59.938 --> 01:52:02.607
<i>I've known what I am</i>

01:52:02.691 --> 01:52:07.195
<i>From the second</i>
<i>your eyes held mine</i>

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:11.533
<i>Ever since then</i>

01:52:11.616 --> 01:52:14.786
<i>I've been a patient man</i>

01:52:15.579 --> 01:52:19.708
<i>Patient with desire</i>

01:52:21.334 --> 01:52:24.129
<i>I know, Cyrano</i>

01:52:24.212 --> 01:52:27.424
<i>I know who you are</i>

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:31.595
<i>Love, I feel the same</i>

01:52:33.346 --> 01:52:36.099
<i>So, no, Cyrano</i>

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:39.144
<i>I won't let you go</i>

01:52:39.227 --> 01:52:44.274
<i>Love's a painful</i>
<i>painful game</i>

01:52:46.067 --> 01:52:47.527
You love me.

01:52:48.612 --> 01:52:49.613
Yes.

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:52.824
And I will not
lose you twice.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:16.598
-<i>Have you ever wanted</i>
<i>something</i> -<i>Wanted something</i>

01:53:17.933 --> 01:53:22.437
<i>So badly you cannot breathe</i>

01:53:23.855 --> 01:53:28.652
<i>Have you ever loved someone</i>

01:53:30.278 --> 01:53:32.280
<i>Madly</i>

01:53:35.408 --> 01:53:37.827
It's you I love.

01:53:40.205 --> 01:53:42.290
You loved the words.

01:53:42.791 --> 01:53:44.292
No.

01:53:44.376 --> 01:53:45.585
You.

01:53:48.588 --> 01:53:50.757
I love Cyrano.

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:52.759
Cyrano is my love.

01:53:54.010 --> 01:53:56.304
I have always
loved Cyrano.

01:54:01.309 --> 01:54:03.061
And I loved...

01:54:04.646 --> 01:54:06.064
my pride.

01:54:11.069 --> 01:54:12.153
No.

01:54:15.824 --> 01:54:16.825
