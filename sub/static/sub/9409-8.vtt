He's crazy.

He's a robot.

They all are.
He's really lifelike, don't you think?

18:15.400 --> 18:18.933
Yeah.
Thanks for stopping him.

18:18.933 --> 18:20.933
No problem.

Your hands, Jerry.
Let me see your hands.

You. It's you,
not Dr. Shreek.

18:38.433 --> 18:40.867
- I need your hands, Jerry.
- You're nuts.

18:41.267 --> 18:44.967
- Why do you need my hands?
- To make beautiful music.

18:44.967 --> 18:47.467
Hands are just too hard to build--

18:47.467 --> 18:50.567
too many moving parts.

18:51.567 --> 18:54.600
I need your hands!

Andrew Toggle.

19:12.967 --> 19:18.367
- I tried my best.
- You were just a lazy boy.

19:18.367 --> 19:22.533
Very clever, but lazy.

19:22.533 --> 19:26.033
You could have mastered
all your pieces...

19:26.033 --> 19:29.533
if you'd only practiced.

19:29.533 --> 19:33.500
I did!
I practiced every day.

So, how are your parents?

20:22.400 --> 20:25.400
The psychiatrist said that talking
about it would help them a lot.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.400
I'm just glad our house is ghost-free.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.400
No more piano, huh?

20:30.400 --> 20:32.867
Not in this lifetime.
Come on.

for terrorizing the boy.

21:03.033 --> 21:06.333
You will practice and practice.

21:06.333 --> 21:09.333
How much longer?

21:09.333 --> 21:13.333
