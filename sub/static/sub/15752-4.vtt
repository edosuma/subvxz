That's right.
You broke the bed.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.860
I--I did--
You broke your bed.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.296
I was just along
for the ride.

My first ride?

01:42.970 --> 01:44.405
Yeah.

- You're really asking me that?
- Mm-hmm.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.646
- Tom Amoroso.
- Yeah.

He took me to
a Nirvana concert.

We got drunk,
did it for two minutes

what were you, five?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.424
Uh...

02:03.524 --> 02:05.793
It was a reunion concert.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.295
It was, like,
a one night only thing.

02:07.395 --> 02:10.062
They had this hologram
of Kurt Cobain.

Let's not--
let's don't weigh things down

02:23.677 --> 02:28.115
with talk of past
or future.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.920
Let's think of ourselves
as, um...

02:35.356 --> 02:36.824
just living
in the present moment.

Well, monks who have dedicated
their lives to lots of sex.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.664
Mm.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.066
So stay in the present

02:46.234 --> 02:47.401
and have lots of sex.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.569
Mm.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.904
I could probably be persuaded.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.873
That's very big of you.
Thank you.

You had sex with him.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.918
Eh...

03:38.018 --> 03:40.721
Not sex per se, at least not sex
as I have come to know it.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.591
[giggling]
Because it was such good sex.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.058
Yeah?

03:45.158 --> 03:46.560
You know that thing
that people describe

03:46.660 --> 03:48.028
when they're having
a near-death experience

03:48.128 --> 03:49.463
where they're floating
above their bodies

03:49.563 --> 03:50.931
and can see themselves
on the operating table?

03:51.031 --> 03:51.932
- Yeah.
- I had that.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.401
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.403
Except instead
of watching someone give me CPR,

03:55.503 --> 03:57.070
I was watching myself
in sexual positions

03:57.170 --> 03:58.706
I thought were only theoretical.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.108
Ooh, fantastic.
Congratulations.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.976
No, it's complicating
everything.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.512
I went over there
to tell him the truth,

04:04.612 --> 04:05.613
and then I didn't tell him,

04:05.713 --> 04:07.315
and then I was gonna tell him
this morning,

04:07.415 --> 04:08.382
but the sex was so good

04:08.482 --> 04:09.717
that I realized
that if I told him,

04:09.817 --> 04:11.118
I might not have sex
with him again,

04:11.218 --> 04:12.653
and I really wanted
to have sex with him again,

04:12.753 --> 04:14.121
and then I did have sex
with him again.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.789
And this is why I'm a monster,

04:15.889 --> 04:18.326

of stealth cougar monster.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.226
Liza, you don't have
to do this to yourself.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.629
And you don't have to tell him.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.631
What am I supposed to do,
just keep lying to the guy?

04:23.731 --> 04:25.366
He's having sex.
You're not hurting him.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.900
I mean, you're not hurting him,
are you?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.235
- Is he into that?
- No.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.070
So why don't you just enjoy
yourself for awhile?

04:30.170 --> 04:31.605
What's so hard about that?

04:31.705 --> 04:32.773
Nothing.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.376

You have no idea.

the publishing house

for the English translation
of Anton Bjornberg's

04:53.894 --> 04:55.429
Now, we're on a tight launch
for the fall,

04:55.529 --> 04:57.264
which will be not
a small challenge,

04:57.365 --> 04:58.766
because the preliminary
translation

04:58.866 --> 05:00.668
might as well be in Swedish.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.371
But I start working with Anton
first thing in the morning,

05:03.404 --> 05:05.873
and I'm confident
that we can meet that deadline.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.876
So I will need marketing
and cover artwork

05:08.976 --> 05:10.444

on my marketing team.

I cannot believe
this is the same girl

05:48.048 --> 05:49.417

slumber parties with

05:49.450 --> 05:50.684
and talk about
how we were gonna marry

05:50.784 --> 05:53.421
Jonathan Taylor Thomas
or Andrew Keegan.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.923
Oh, my God.
We were obsessed.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.625
Wait.
Which one were you?

05:57.725 --> 05:58.692
Which what, now?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.694
Who'd you like better?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.530
Oh, uh,
Keegan.

- Oh.
- Ugh.

I know.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.200
Yeah,
I was a Keeger.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.503
Oh, no.
JT squared all the way.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.504
No contest.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.939
By the way,

06:12.039 --> 06:14.274
we could so bang
Jonathan Taylor Thomas now.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.676
- Yeah, we could.
- Yeah.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.345
Yeah, how have
we not banged him yet?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.581
Find out who Jonathan Taylor
Thomas' publicist is,

06:20.681 --> 06:22.149
see if I can bang him.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.752
Also, Mark-Paul Gosselaar.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.920
Also, Tiffani Amber Thiessen.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.188
To Kels-Bells,

06:28.288 --> 06:31.124

and taking over the world.

Uh-huh.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.528
Hey, don't let me drink
too much tonight.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.664
Okay, I have to be sharp
for Bjornberg tomorrow.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.700
I get past a certain point,
it's not cute.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.834
Don't worry.
I got your back.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.603
You're my girl.

Hey, hey.
What's up, ladies?

06:44.805 --> 06:46.840
Babe, I thought you had to work.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.942
I pawned a few things
off on the assistants,

06:49.042 --> 06:49.943
but it's fine.

06:50.043 --> 06:50.944
They have it all.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.480
Perfect timing.
You can have my chair.

What?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.015
I know.
I know. It's tragic.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.617
I got to jet to this party
in Crown Heights

06:56.717 --> 06:58.385
where they're serving sushi
off cisgender models.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.553
- What?
- Don't ask.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.854
I love you.
I am so proud of you.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.155
Muah. Muah.
Love you.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.495

my girl's big night.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.772
- Yes.
- For a celebration?

you're here.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.523
Ooh.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.190
Another round.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.360
Uh, actually, I think that might
be enough for Kelsey and me.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.362
What?
You're kidding, right?

07:42.530 --> 07:44.732
Oh, she asked me not to let her
drink too much tonight,

07:44.832 --> 07:46.299
so maybe we should cool it
on the shots.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.368
Whoa, I thought this
was gonna be a celebration.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.370
Who invited the fun police?

07:50.538 --> 07:51.404
Don't stress.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.840
I know you girls
make garbage money.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.542
I'll pick up the tab.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.043
I'm not worried
about who's gonna pay.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.445
I'm worried about her meeting
with her author in the morning,

07:58.546 --> 07:59.780
which is important.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.649
Sweetie, I move $50 million
in paper each day.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.116
You don't see me ruining

08:03.216 --> 08:05.118
everybody else's good time,
do you?

08:05.218 --> 08:07.555
Come on.
You deserve it.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.190
Okay.
Just this one.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.892
Okay, and then water.

That's my ride-or-die bitch.

- Another round.
- Whoo.

You can't leave a shot
on the table.

some waters?

you pass a point

08:54.501 --> 08:56.003
(woman)
* Ready, set, go

08:56.103 --> 08:57.470
* We don't stop
until we're done *

08:57.605 --> 08:58.739
* Take your places
on the floor *

08:58.839 --> 08:59.907
* Start it,
three, two, one *

09:00.007 --> 09:02.109
Ah, love this song.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.210
[laughs]

09:03.310 --> 09:04.377
[Thad grunts]

09:04.477 --> 09:05.979
Hello.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.480
Have I met you before?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.382
Uh-huh.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.984
Okeydoke.
That's my cue.

09:11.084 --> 09:11.985
All right.
Come on.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.086
Yeah, we should go home.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.622
- Yep.
- Home?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.757
What?
We're just getting started.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.758
I know what we're gonna do.

09:17.858 --> 09:18.892
[laughs]

09:18.992 --> 09:20.093
Oh, this is gonna be
so genius.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.962
We're gonna go.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.264
We're gonna see that guy
that Liza's been seeing, Jeremy.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.066
- Josh?
- Josh.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.768
We're gonna go see
Josh at his tattoo parlor

09:27.868 --> 09:29.937
in Brooklyn,
and we're all gonna get tattoos.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.338
Babe, you know
I don't do Brooklyn.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.773
- No offense.
- Lots taken.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.975
Too late.
I already ordered the Uber.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.109
[sighs]

09:36.209 --> 09:37.778
This is gonna be epic.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.914
I'm gonna commemorate
my first acquisition.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.850
I got to do something Swedish.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.452
Like, a little Volvo
on my left boob

09:45.552 --> 09:47.520
or--or a meatball.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.156
Okay.
Thad's going home.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.091
I'm going home.
We're all going home.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.860
Oh, I thought
I was your ride-or-die bitch.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.663
You are, especially
if that ride's going back

09:55.696 --> 09:56.664
to my place right now.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.999
No.
Tattoos.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.801
Fine.
I'm out of here.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.670
What?
Fine.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.105
Go home and finish
binging Gilmore Girls.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.008
He loves that show.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.609
Our Uber's here.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.644
[squeals]
Let's go.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.345
Oh.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.814
(man)
* La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la *

10:13.914 --> 10:15.215
(man)
* I'm a player, baby

10:15.315 --> 10:16.583
I can't believe
Thad didn't come.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.786
That might have been the
smartest thing Thad's ever done.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.353
Listen to me,
right now

10:20.453 --> 10:22.189
you need to be more concerned
about your meeting

10:22.289 --> 10:23.657
with Anton Bjornberg
in the morning.

10:23.757 --> 10:24.692
Bjornberg?

10:24.792 --> 10:27.995
[laughs]
He's so cute.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.730
Oh.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.464
I mean,

10:31.564 --> 10:34.501
look at those smoldering eyes.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.670
They're very smoldering.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.338
Okay, I get it.
I know.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.709
You're all sober
and blah and snore.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.310
Don't try to tell me

10:43.410 --> 10:45.612
that you're not just
a little bit excited

10:45.713 --> 10:46.980
to visit Josh again.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.382
Just teeny, weeny bit.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.584
Just a teeny, weeny,
little baby bit.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.652
[laughs]

10:52.753 --> 10:54.387
[laughs]

10:54.487 --> 10:55.455
Stop.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.589
That's more like it.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.624
[laughs]

10:57.725 --> 11:00.127
[groans]
He's hot.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.797
"You are hot."

11:03.897 --> 11:04.998
Send.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.334
- Uh. Yeah.
- Send?

11:07.434 --> 11:08.736
What do you mean,
"send"?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.637
Please tell me you did
not just send

11:10.738 --> 11:13.073
our prized new author
a text that says, "You are hot."

11:13.173 --> 11:15.909
Okay.
I won't tell you, then.

11:16.009 --> 11:16.910
But I did.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.545
[laughs]

11:18.645 --> 11:22.315
You should see your face
right now.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.851
[laughing]

11:23.951 --> 11:25.886
(man)
* Yo, yo

11:25.986 --> 11:27.354
[Kelsey laughing]

11:27.454 --> 11:28.922
(Liza)
All right.
Just get out.

11:29.022 --> 11:29.923
(man)
* What we gonna do?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.092
- Careful.
- Oh, no.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.994
(Liza)
All right, see, I told you.
It's closed.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.595
How is this even possible?

11:35.763 --> 11:37.197
'Cause it's after midnight
on a weekday,

11:37.297 --> 11:38.431
and he's not a coke dealer.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.900
All right,
can we get in the cab now?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.468
Come on, let's go.
Let--

11:41.568 --> 11:43.603
Wait. Wait. Okay, wait, wait.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.072
Didn't you tell me
that he lived here?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.674
You did.
You--I know it. I know it.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.242
He lives right there.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.078
But he's obviously out
or already asleep.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.146
- Okay, well, call him.
- No, that's not gonna happen.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.481
No, call him.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.615
- Call him.
- Stop.

11:55.783 --> 11:56.784
I didn't come all the way--

11:56.850 --> 11:58.218
- Stop! Stop!
- [yelps]

11:58.318 --> 11:59.686
I didn't come here
to not get a tattoo!

11:59.787 --> 12:00.988
Call him!

12:01.088 --> 12:03.857
No, I don't want to bother him.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.092
Josh!

12:05.192 --> 12:06.393
Stop it.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.195
Seriously,
are you--are you insane?

12:08.295 --> 12:09.863
- I'm sorry.
- Will you please--

12:09.963 --> 12:12.399
(Liza)
Oh, my gosh.
You can't do that.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.533
- Are you crazy?
- Wake up!

12:13.633 --> 12:14.802
Are you insane?
Stop it.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.569
[Kelsey babbling indistinctly]

12:16.669 --> 12:20.007
[both yelling at once]

12:20.107 --> 12:21.008
Ha!

12:21.108 --> 12:22.009
[glass shatters]

12:22.109 --> 12:24.111
[gasps]

12:30.683 --> 12:31.684
[retching]

12:36.723 --> 12:37.657
Liza.

12:37.825 --> 12:38.725
[sighs]
I'm so sorry.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.093
My friend's really drunk,

12:40.193 --> 12:42.062
and she just threw a rock
through your window.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.964
I'm so much better now.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.065
I'm going back inside.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.468
- Liza--
- Uh, no.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.837
We shouldn't have come.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.471
- Um...
- I'm gonna get a tattoo.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.306
No, we're gonna, uh--
I'll pay for that window.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.674
All right.
It's okay. Taxi!

12:54.842 --> 12:56.143
(Kelsey)
Wait. I didn't get a tattoo.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.411
Liza, will you just wait
one second, please?

12:58.511 --> 13:00.013
I have to get her home, okay?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.015
[sighs]

13:03.984 --> 13:06.519
(Liza)
You and all the tequila
you drank

13:06.619 --> 13:07.955
need to get in that cab
this instant!

13:08.055 --> 13:08.956
- [yelps]
- Get in there!

13:09.056 --> 13:09.990
(Kelsey)
Okay.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.158
(Josh)
Liza.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.562
Liza.

13:20.868 --> 13:21.902
Two years of no sex.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.236
And the second
I dip my toe back in,

13:23.336 --> 13:25.072
this is what I get.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.974
I mean, it's not like I have
any claims on the guy.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.976
I mean, I'm the one who said,
"Let's keep it light."

13:29.076 --> 13:30.443
It's just--I just can't believe

13:30.543 --> 13:32.245
that he would jump into bed
with somebody else

13:32.345 --> 13:33.746
right after he'd been with me.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.782
Doesn't his penis
ever need a break?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.784
[laughs]
Welcome to 26.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.787
That moment
when I saw them together,

13:40.888 --> 13:43.123
my stomach just dropped.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.892
Maybe I was wrong.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.895
Maybe this is more
than just fun.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.629
No, it's definitely
not fun anymore.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.907
[phone alarm buzzing,
dinging]

14:02.475 --> 14:04.477
[groans]

14:06.379 --> 14:07.480
[groans]

14:11.551 --> 14:13.620
(Kelsey)
Hey, it's Kelsey.
Don't leave a message.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.955
I never check this.

14:15.055 --> 14:15.956
[voice mail beeps]

14:16.056 --> 14:17.457
Kelsey, where are you?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.126
Bjornberg is here.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.128
(Diana)
Liza.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.829
Why is Anton Bjornberg
sitting by himself

14:22.930 --> 14:24.464
in our conference room?

14:24.564 --> 14:27.000
Uh, he's here for his first
meeting with Kelsey.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.603
Well, that explains why he's
sitting in our conference room,

14:30.703 --> 14:32.505
but not the "by himself" part.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.107
Kelsey has been
slightly delayed.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.508
How delayed?

14:35.608 --> 14:37.044
That is undetermined
at this time.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.446
What are you,
the White House press secretary?

14:39.546 --> 14:42.482
If you don't tell me,
I can't fix it.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.650
[sighs]

14:43.750 --> 14:45.285
She was worked up about today

14:45.385 --> 14:46.653
and nervous about the deal,

14:46.753 --> 14:48.621
so I gave her some Ambien.

14:48.721 --> 14:52.459
There is a slight possibility
she may still be asleep.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.660
Oh, dear God.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.231
Anton.
Diana Trout, head of marketing.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.699
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.602
This is my associate, Liza...
something.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.704
Kelsey's been slightly detained.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.307
Uh, let's chat a bit
about marketing.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.542
I'd be very interested
in your input.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.678
My input is
I don't care about marketing.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.047
And if you understood anything
about my work,

15:14.147 --> 15:15.648
you would know that about me.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.387
You know what, perhaps
I've made a mistake here.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:36.003 --> 15:38.071
Hey, I'm here.
I'm here.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.139
Oh, good, because he's gone

15:39.239 --> 15:41.041
along with his book, probably.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.510
What? You guys couldn't have
kept him here for five minutes?

15:43.610 --> 15:47.014
I tried, started talking to him
about marketing.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.549
God, that's--that's the worst
thing you could have done.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.018
Really?

15:51.084 --> 15:52.685
Worse than not showing up?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.521
I don't think so.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.426
We really did
try to stall him.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.828
Liza, seriously, I thought you
had my back last night.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.463
Thanks for nothing.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.265
What?

16:05.365 --> 16:07.500
I told you to not let me
get too drunk.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.802
News flash: I tried
my best to stop you.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.172
But you started doing shots like
a Lohan once Thad showed up.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.307
And then you insisted on
going all the way to Brooklyn,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.809
dragged me down to Josh's place
for a ridiculous Swedish tattoo,

16:16.909 --> 16:18.511
and then you threw a rock
through his window.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.713
Oh, and I did I mention he was
with another girl at the time?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.049
So thanks for that.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.583
Well, I don't remember
any of that.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.618
And while it does sound awful,

16:25.718 --> 16:27.054
if you had been
a proper wingwoman,

16:27.120 --> 16:29.056
none of that would have
happened.

16:29.156 --> 16:32.359
I don't--I don't even have words
to describe how crazy you sound.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.094
You sound like a 50-year-old.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.662
50? How dare you.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.330
You know, you asked me
to look out for you,

16:37.430 --> 16:40.767
and then I do,
and you accuse me of acting...

16:40.867 --> 16:43.570
significantly older than I am.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.573
You know, you can rant
and deflect blame all you want,

16:46.673 --> 16:49.542
or you can own this,
take responsibility for it,

16:49.642 --> 16:50.843
and go fix it.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.183
You're right.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.950
I'm sorry.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.352
And I'm sorry you had
to walk in

16:59.452 --> 17:03.090
on Josh taking some girl
to Poundtown.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.523
Technically, I didn't see

17:04.624 --> 17:08.228
any of the actual voyage
to Poundtown.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.198
She was really pretty, though.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.433
I bet she's stupid.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.434
She looked stupid.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.535
Like a big stupid cow.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.669
You don't even remember.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.115
[Kelsey sighs]

17:28.214 --> 17:30.217
[bell rings]

17:33.386 --> 17:34.387
Hi.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.957
Well, our meeting was
two hours ago.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.559
Yeah.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.729
I was late this morning
because signing you

17:42.829 --> 17:45.265
is the biggest thing
that has ever happened to me.

17:45.365 --> 17:48.135
And I was so excited,
I went out to celebrate,

17:48.201 --> 17:49.436
and I got drunk--

17:49.536 --> 17:50.803
really drunk--

17:50.903 --> 17:52.139
and I overslept.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.806
And I'm so sorry.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.941
It won't happen again.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.243
I promise you that.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.479
Will this happen again?

18:01.948 --> 18:03.483
God, no.
No.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.486
That will never
happen again either.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.988
Okay.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.223
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.724
See you tomorrow.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.901
We both get one mistake.

18:27.006 --> 18:30.177
[laughs]

18:36.983 --> 18:37.984
Hi.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.390
Hey.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.795
All right, so, um...

18:48.895 --> 18:51.631
Listen, she is a girl
that I used to date.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.701
And occasionally
she still comes over.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.670
And last night,
it was unannounced.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.871
I'm sorry.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.407
No, I'm sorry.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.209
I was unannounced.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.277
I would have to told you
about her sooner,

19:04.377 --> 19:06.413
but you said you didn't want
to talk about the past, so.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.880
And is she?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.616
Not that
that's any of my business.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.950
Totally.

19:11.050 --> 19:14.554
Yes.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.555
What about you?

19:15.655 --> 19:16.989
Huh?

19:17.089 --> 19:18.825
What's the story
with your last relationship?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.893
[chuckles]

19:20.993 --> 19:22.662
It's so boring.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.464
I mean, seriously?

19:24.564 --> 19:27.800
We broke the bed
in three different places.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.836
[laughs]

19:29.936 --> 19:31.971
[laughs]

19:32.071 --> 19:35.808
Um...

19:35.908 --> 19:37.977
It was awhile ago.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.979
He was a poet when we met.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.482
He's really talented, actually.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.084
But then life happened,

19:45.252 --> 19:46.519
and he needed
to make some money,

19:46.619 --> 19:49.756
so he gave up on his dreams.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.693
I had a relative

19:53.793 --> 19:55.328
become dependent on me,

19:55.428 --> 19:57.697
so, you know,
that changed me.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.933
And then he cheated on me,
so I left.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.905
For India.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.575
Yes,
for India.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.443
Wow.

20:10.543 --> 20:14.046
That is some heavy stuff
for a college relationship.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.349
Well, it was an Ivy League
school.

20:18.351 --> 20:22.455
Do you think that I can maybe
have another chance?

20:24.824 --> 20:27.059
I'm all about second chances.

20:36.336 --> 20:36.903
(woman)
* Ooh
