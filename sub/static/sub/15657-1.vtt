WEBVTT

00:10.677 --> 00:13.846
It's my very pleasant duty
to welcome you here

00:13.930 --> 00:16.515
on behalf of all the other artists
and musicians

00:16.599 --> 00:17.891
whose combined talents

00:17.976 --> 00:22.146
went into the creation of this
new form of entertainment, Fantasia.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.399
What you will see
on the screen

00:25.483 --> 00:28.110
is a picture of the various
abstract images

00:28.194 --> 00:30.404
that might pass through your mind

00:30.488 --> 00:33.907
if you sat in a concert hall
listening to this music.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.206
Now, there are three kinds of music
on this Fantasia programme.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.626
First, there's the kind
that tells a definite story.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.756
Then there's the kind that,
while it has no specific plot,

00:48.840 --> 00:52.426
does paint a series of, more or less,
definite pictures.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.345
Then there's a third kind,

00:55.430 --> 00:58.265
music that exists
simply for its own sake.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.352
The number that opens
our Fantasia programme

01:02.437 --> 01:04.938
is music of this third kind.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.250
You know, what's amazing
is that many of these musicians

04:11.334 --> 04:13.877
are playing for the very first time.

04:13.962 --> 04:18.966
Thanks to Steve Martin's Two-Week
Master Musician Home Study course.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.591
More about that later.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.762
Hello, and welcome to Fantasia 2000.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.598
It's been more than 60 years
since Walt Disney and his artists,

04:26.683 --> 04:29.268
teamed up with maestro
Leopold Stokowski

04:29.352 --> 04:32.771
to create a film they titled
The Concert Feature.

04:32.855 --> 04:36.358
I think we're all glad that
they changed the name to Fantasia.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.987
You know, Fantasia was meant to be
a perpetual work in progress.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.115
Every time you went to see it,
you'd experience some new pieces

04:43.199 --> 04:45.617
along with some
old familiar favourites.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.037
But that idea fell by the wayside,
until now.

04:49.330 --> 04:52.457
So let me turn things over
to the great Itzhak Perlman,

04:52.542 --> 04:56.169
who, I have just been informed,
plays the violin.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.964
Well, so do I. Big deal.
Could I have my violin, please?

04:59.674 --> 05:03.010
Thank you.
All right, boys, let's...

05:03.177 --> 05:05.262
Sorry. Could I have
another stick thingy, please?

05:05.596 --> 05:07.514
And camera back on me.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.558
Camera back on me.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.269
Am I done?

05:13.563 --> 05:16.648
When you hear a title like
Pines of Rome

05:16.733 --> 05:21.028
you might think of tree-lined streets
and romantic ruins.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.989
But when the Disney animators
heard this music,

05:24.073 --> 05:26.742
they thought of something
completely different.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.994
Here is the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra

05:29.078 --> 05:31.455
conducted by
maestro James Levine,

05:31.539 --> 05:35.709
performing Ottorino Respighi's
Pines of Rome.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.381
Beautiful, Ralph.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.257
Hi.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.803
Next, we're gonna take you
to the streets of New York City

16:11.887 --> 16:15.098
for a piece that's inspired by
a couple of my favourite artists.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.017
First there's the illustrator
Al Hirschfeld,

16:18.102 --> 16:20.478
who's been drawing celebrities
and Broadway stars

16:20.562 --> 16:22.480
for most of the 20th century.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.816
And then there's composer,
songwriter George Gershwin,

16:24.900 --> 16:27.819
who took jazz off the streets,
dressed her up,

16:27.903 --> 16:30.071
and took her to the concert hall.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.574
My friend Ralph Grierson
plays piano on this next number.

16:33.701 --> 16:37.203
And it all starts with a single
slinky note on a clarinet,

16:37.287 --> 16:40.415
and a simple line
on a piece of paper.

16:40.541 --> 16:44.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
Rhapsody in Blue.

29:19.382 --> 29:22.217
Hi. You may not know this,
but over the years,

29:22.302 --> 29:24.595
the Disney artists have
cooked up dozens of ideas

29:24.679 --> 29:26.555
for new Fantasia segments.

29:26.639 --> 29:29.224
Some of them made it
to the big screen this time,

29:29.309 --> 29:31.769
but others, lots of others...

29:31.853 --> 29:34.396
How can I put this politely?
Didn't.

29:35.023 --> 29:38.734
For example, the Danish illustrator
Kay Nielsen drew these sketches

29:38.818 --> 29:42.780
for a segment inspired
by Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.615
Here they are,

29:44.699 --> 29:46.700
and there they go.

29:46.910 --> 29:50.120
Now, Salvador Dali, you know,
the "limp watches" guy,

29:50.205 --> 29:52.790
he got into the act with an idea
that featured baseball

29:52.874 --> 29:54.792
as a metaphor for life.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.795
How come that didn't work?
Makes perfect sense to me.

29:57.879 --> 30:01.632
Let's see. Then we had
a bug ballet and a baby ballet,

30:01.716 --> 30:04.009
and for a time,
they even considered a sequence

30:04.093 --> 30:06.637
inspired by
The Polka and the Fugue,

30:06.721 --> 30:10.307
from Weinberger's
Schwanda the Bagpiper.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.851
But finally, a success.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.604
The Disney artists
wanted to create a short film,

30:15.688 --> 30:18.315
based on Hans Christian Andersen's
wonderful fairy tale

30:18.399 --> 30:20.192
The Steadfast Tin Soldier,

30:20.276 --> 30:24.196
but they could never find
the perfect musical match until now.

30:24.572 --> 30:26.281
Here is Yefim Bronfman,

30:26.366 --> 30:29.326
playing the Shostakovich
Piano Concerto Number 2,

30:29.410 --> 30:32.371
and The Steadfast Tin Soldier.

38:11.622 --> 38:13.873
These drawing boards
have been the birthplace

38:13.958 --> 38:17.294
of some of the most beloved
animal characters of all time.

38:17.378 --> 38:20.797
So it's no surprise that the artists
chose for our next segment

38:20.881 --> 38:24.175
The Carnival of the Animals
by Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.637
Here, the sensitive strains
of impressionistic music

38:27.722 --> 38:30.682
combine with the subtle artistry
of the animator,

38:30.766 --> 38:33.560
to finally answer
that age-old question,

38:33.644 --> 38:36.313
"What is man's
relationship to nature?"

38:37.732 --> 38:39.065
Sorry.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.484
That age-old question,

38:41.569 --> 38:45.405
"What would happen if you gave
a yo-yo to a flock of flamingos?"

38:46.240 --> 38:47.240
Who wrote this?

40:43.691 --> 40:46.067
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to take a moment, if we may,

40:46.152 --> 40:49.612
to talk about a little something
we like to refer to as magic.

40:49.697 --> 40:50.989
Picture this.
You're at home,

40:51.073 --> 40:53.032
hosting a birthday party
for your daughter,

40:53.117 --> 40:55.034
and you've
just shelled out 50 bucks,

40:55.119 --> 41:00.540
so some pathetic loser can pull
a mangy rabbit out of a flea market hat.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.460
At first,
you might wonder to yourself,

41:03.544 --> 41:05.336
"How did he do that?"

41:05.421 --> 41:09.340
But then you would probably
just dismiss it as some sort of a trick.

41:09.425 --> 41:13.136
And you know something?
You'd be right! It's just a trick.

41:13.220 --> 41:17.432
It's an example of what we
laughingly refer to as stage magic.

41:17.683 --> 41:22.437
We're here to tell you that all
stage magic is a fraud, a hoax, a sham.

41:22.521 --> 41:26.816
It's all based on deception
and, yep, lying. All of it.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.902
Sleight of hand... Lies.

41:29.069 --> 41:31.237
Transformations... Fraud.

41:31.405 --> 41:34.115
Dismemberment... Rip-off!

41:34.325 --> 41:37.827
Fake! All are illusions.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.872
What we're here to talk about
is real magic.

41:40.956 --> 41:44.125
We're gonna bring on a guy now
who's the real deal, the genuine article.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.920
In fact, he taught us
everything we know.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.088
And he is featured prominently
in the next sequence,

41:49.173 --> 41:52.634
from the original Fantasia,
The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

41:54.428 --> 41:56.304
You know, come to think of it,

41:56.388 --> 41:59.349
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,
is a little guy,

41:59.433 --> 42:03.353
who never speaks
and just kind of messes everything up,

42:03.437 --> 42:04.687
like him.

42:05.397 --> 42:06.940
And now...

42:08.484 --> 42:10.026
And now, the...

42:10.778 --> 42:13.029
Hi. Hi, little fella.
I gotta...

42:13.113 --> 42:16.282
And now,
The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

51:37.344 --> 51:40.179
Mr Stokowski.
Mr Stokowski!

51:42.432 --> 51:45.351
Just wanted to offer
my congratulations, sir.

51:45.936 --> 51:48.229
Congratulations to you, Mickey.

51:48.563 --> 51:52.274
Aw, gee, thanks.
Well, I gotta run now. So long!

51:52.901 --> 51:55.611
Mr Levine!
Okay, Mr Levine.

51:55.695 --> 51:57.655
Everybody's in place
for the next number.

51:57.739 --> 51:59.490
Thanks, Mickey.

51:59.574 --> 52:01.200
When...

52:01.326 --> 52:02.785
But we can't find Donald.

52:02.869 --> 52:06.413
So you stay here and stall for time.
I'll be right back.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.917
Donald! Oh, Donald!

52:10.210 --> 52:13.712
When we hear Sir Edward Elgar's
Pomp and Circumstance,

52:13.797 --> 52:15.673
we think of a graduation ceremony.

52:15.757 --> 52:16.799
Donald, where are ya?

52:16.883 --> 52:20.803
Actually, Elgar composed it
for many kinds of solemn events.

52:20.887 --> 52:22.096
Donald!

52:22.764 --> 52:27.268
This march inspired the Disney artists
to recreate the age-old story...

52:28.061 --> 52:30.229
- Sorry, Daisy.
- ...of Noah's Ark,

52:30.313 --> 52:32.189
with one slight twist.

52:32.315 --> 52:33.899
Donald Duck!

52:34.901 --> 52:36.819
- Who is it?
- Donald, it's me, Mickey.

52:36.903 --> 52:38.195
You're on in 30 seconds. Hurry!

52:38.280 --> 52:40.698
What? You gotta be kidding!
I'm not even dressed...

52:41.408 --> 52:44.076
Okay, Jim, he's on his way.
Go to the intro.

52:46.288 --> 52:49.081
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pomp and Circumstance,

52:49.166 --> 52:51.500
starring Donald Duck.

59:10.672 --> 59:13.006
Walt Disney described
the art of animation

59:13.091 --> 59:15.300
as a voyage of discovery

59:15.385 --> 59:18.220
into the realms of colour,
sound and motion.

59:18.805 --> 59:22.099
The music from Igor Stravinsky's
ballet, The Firebird,

59:22.183 --> 59:24.101
inspires such a voyage.

59:24.644 --> 59:27.396
And so we conclude
this version of Fantasia

59:27.480 --> 59:31.650
with a mythical story
of life, death and renewal.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:23.958
Camera back on me.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:27.211
Camera back on me, please.
Anyone? Hello?

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:31.048
Hello? Could someone give me
a ride home?
