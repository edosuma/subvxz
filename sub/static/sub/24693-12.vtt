In New York City's war on crime,

00:08.299 --> 00:11.451
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.451 --> 00:13.259
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.259 --> 00:15.125
These are their stories.

00:25.739 --> 00:27.378
You give great mic.

00:28.108 --> 00:29.487
Came by messenger, Elliot.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.702
It's marked "Urgent" and "Personal."

00:31.702 --> 00:32.926
Okay.

00:40.522 --> 00:42.440
Elliot, Elliot. Calm down.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.141
There is nothing that says that these
pictures have to run in my column.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.156
Not now, Evie,
we're about to go live.

01:04.349 --> 01:06.101
Opened it by mistake.

01:10.718 --> 01:13.631
TK, it's somebody named Elliot.

01:14.293 --> 01:16.223
He sounds upset.

01:16.954 --> 01:20.145
Thanks, sis.
You're late for school.

01:20.145 --> 01:21.397
Bye.

01:26.365 --> 01:28.792
Elliot. You got my package.

01:29.186 --> 01:31.467
It's not a bribe.
It's an opportunity.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.530
This is gonna be the hot new place.

01:33.530 --> 01:35.105
This is the final payment?

01:35.105 --> 01:38.039
The cat's in the bag
and the bag's in the river.

01:38.039 --> 01:40.161
Come on, push.
Get him to say it.

01:40.161 --> 01:42.407
In English.

01:42.407 --> 01:44.463
The pictures go away, right?

01:44.463 --> 01:45.637
Right.

01:48.092 --> 01:51.908
Look, I'm not out to ruin your life.

01:51.908 --> 01:54.511
You're an eagle scout
compared to some.

01:54.511 --> 01:57.707
It's not like you tried
to take advantage of some nun

01:57.707 --> 02:00.094
or some naive little high school girl.

02:01.139 --> 02:05.058
Some bum does that, there is
not enough money in the world.

02:06.238 --> 02:08.310
I do have a little integrity.

02:11.319 --> 02:12.635
What the hell was that?

02:17.891 --> 02:19.198
Help me.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.125
I can't hear anything.

02:22.903 --> 02:24.987
I can't hear anything!

03:16.592 --> 03:17.549
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2008/06/15

03:20.179 --> 03:21.518
Hey, Wheeler.

03:21.898 --> 03:24.230
So you were overseas for six months.
The city's quiet.

03:24.230 --> 03:25.944
You come back, all hell breaks loose.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.444
I missed you too, Logan.

03:27.979 --> 03:31.609
Whoa, we got some crispy critters here.

03:31.609 --> 03:32.570
Catch me up.

03:32.570 --> 03:35.684
Victim's name was TK Richmond.
He worked for the Ledger.

03:35.684 --> 03:38.320
The DA's office
had him under surveillance.

03:38.714 --> 03:40.987
A gossip columnist?
What are you looking at him for?

03:40.987 --> 03:45.089
He was blackmailing Elliot Falls,
the local newscaster.

03:45.089 --> 03:48.106
- Gay sex?
- Nope. Call girls.

03:48.106 --> 03:50.408
Think Spitzer, not McGreevey.

03:50.408 --> 03:52.312
Elliot was wearing a wire
when the car blew.

03:52.312 --> 03:54.383
The bomb squad's trying
to piece together what happened.

03:54.383 --> 03:57.132
- And he survived this?
- Bellevue ER.

03:57.132 --> 03:59.918
Rattled, singed.
He'll be okay.

03:59.918 --> 04:01.961
Might need to speak up a little.

04:07.237 --> 04:11.042
I said, "who else knew
where you were meeting TK Richmond?"

04:11.042 --> 04:13.220
Just the guys from the DA's office.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.308
Look, I was trying to keep this quiet.

04:16.308 --> 04:18.182
For my family's sake.

04:18.182 --> 04:19.541
Good luck with that.

04:19.541 --> 04:21.737
How much did TK hit you up for?

04:21.737 --> 04:24.313
He'd already got me for 100 grand.

04:24.660 --> 04:27.240
Then he came back for another bite.

04:27.240 --> 04:32.586
Only this time, he got cagey.
He said it was for an investment.

04:32.586 --> 04:34.350
Some new restaurant.

04:34.350 --> 04:35.758
Place have a name?

04:35.758 --> 04:38.477
No. But I'd heard of the chef.

04:38.477 --> 04:40.503
He's been on our morning show.

04:42.349 --> 04:45.800
TK was always trying to get to the biz.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.211
He wanted to be a big player
in a corner booth.

04:48.211 --> 04:49.882
How big a player was he?

04:49.882 --> 04:54.938
The other day he told me
he reeled in a news guy for 50k.

04:54.938 --> 04:56.973
Was that his first fish?

04:56.973 --> 04:58.800
Three others.
$50,000 a pop.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.289
We're gonna need those names.

05:00.289 --> 05:03.202
Yeah, so am I.
I got architect bills, you know.

05:03.202 --> 05:05.233
You don't know your investors' names?

05:05.694 --> 05:10.115
Um, one of them is,
I think, into real estate.

05:10.115 --> 05:12.139
TK thought if he gave me the names,

05:12.139 --> 05:15.131
I'd go around 'em, which I would have.

05:15.655 --> 05:17.719
TK didn't have three other investors.

05:17.719 --> 05:19.614
He had three other marks
he was blackmailing.

05:19.614 --> 05:22.153
Elliot's dumb, but not dumb enough
to car-bomb himself.

05:22.153 --> 05:24.825
Maybe one of TK's other marks
blew up the deal.

05:25.843 --> 05:29.400
TK's been my legal guardian
since mom and dad died.

05:30.441 --> 05:33.069
He rented us this place last year.

05:33.526 --> 05:37.721
He knew that I wanted to stay in the city
and go to the performing arts high school.

05:37.721 --> 05:40.590
Your big brother,
he took care of you.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.617
Who would do this to him?

05:45.387 --> 05:48.119
Jeannie, you knew he was
a gossip columnist, right?

05:48.119 --> 05:49.880
Of course I did.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.276
He called me gal Friday.

05:52.523 --> 05:55.857
He'd write his columns, and
people would get mad, like that Elliot guy.

05:55.857 --> 05:58.551
And the next week,
they'd go out and laugh about it.

05:58.551 --> 06:01.235
Who else was angry besides Elliot?

06:01.659 --> 06:04.757
Once people got to know TK,
they really liked him.

06:04.757 --> 06:07.271
We'll need to see what stories
he was working on.

06:07.271 --> 06:08.911
Do you know where he kept his laptop?

06:08.911 --> 06:10.996
Only he didn't have one.

06:10.996 --> 06:14.619
He typed all of his stories
on that old Remington.

06:14.619 --> 06:18.493
And then I'd retype them on my desktop
and email them to the paper.

06:18.493 --> 06:20.584
Is this where he kept his fi...

06:20.584 --> 06:21.868
Whoa.

06:24.213 --> 06:26.786
We got valley of the dolls in here.

06:27.149 --> 06:29.511
Darvon. Secobarbital.

06:29.511 --> 06:31.514
Even his drugs were old school.

06:31.514 --> 06:34.207
He only used those to try to sleep.

06:35.768 --> 06:39.720
Well, maybe he didn't have a laptop,
but he must've kept notebooks.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.021
He didn't really take any notes.

06:42.021 --> 06:43.875
He didn't want
to get them subpoenaed.

06:43.875 --> 06:46.106
Sure. That makes sense.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.984
But the stories you typed for him.
Are they on your computer?

06:48.984 --> 06:53.145
Yeah. But if it's easier,

06:53.530 --> 06:56.122
I clipped every column he ever wrote.

06:57.607 --> 06:59.899
I'll go get you the scrapbook.

07:03.202 --> 07:07.092
Explosive itself isn't unusual.
Just a standard little pack of C4.

07:07.092 --> 07:08.356
How was it set off?

07:08.356 --> 07:09.857
Now that's interesting.

07:09.857 --> 07:12.464
TK pushed in the cigarette lighter,

07:12.464 --> 07:17.064
which sent the frequency
that ignited the charge in the headrest.

07:17.064 --> 07:19.876
It's been used a few times
in the Middle East, but not here.

07:19.876 --> 07:23.384
So we're looking for an old-time pro
who likes to stay on top of trends?

07:23.384 --> 07:25.683
Think Tony Bennett, not Steve and Eydie.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.912
Okay, Captain Petrosino.
Keep us posted.

07:29.843 --> 07:33.516
Not much, except whoever planted it
must've known TK was a smoker.

07:33.516 --> 07:35.287
Well, there's no great deduction there.

07:35.287 --> 07:38.640
He smoked everywhere.
The guy was a walking violation.

07:39.267 --> 07:41.891
Welcome back, Wheeler.
You were missed.

07:42.866 --> 07:45.241
Tan line on your ring finger.

07:45.241 --> 07:46.697
I got engaged.

07:46.697 --> 07:49.181
What? Since when?

07:49.181 --> 07:50.774
You'll meet him.

07:50.774 --> 07:54.897
TK's clips and phone records.
There may be a pattern.

07:54.897 --> 07:56.978
He would trash certain players relentlessly.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.421
Then there'd be a flurry
of back and forth phone calls.

07:59.421 --> 08:03.061
And suddenly he'd start writing
puff pieces about them.

08:03.061 --> 08:06.215
Hm. So he beat them till they beg for mercy,
and then he charged them.

08:06.215 --> 08:07.390
Who are we looking at?

08:07.390 --> 08:11.786
So far, a real estate developer,
a concert promoter, and a casino owner.

08:11.786 --> 08:14.703
Even odds on any of those worlds
breeding a killer.

08:15.069 --> 08:16.304
Track 'em down.

08:16.304 --> 08:21.039
Hey, remember the chef told us
that one of the investors was in real estate?

08:21.699 --> 08:24.714
It could be this blowhard.

08:24.714 --> 08:26.103
Ted Regan.

08:26.103 --> 08:29.453
He's got that big waterfront development
going up over in the West Side.

08:31.621 --> 08:34.697
By the way, Logan,
was this a, uh...

08:34.697 --> 08:36.501
welcome home gift?

08:36.501 --> 08:39.029
It's Falacci's.
She must have left it here by mistake.

08:39.029 --> 08:41.590
Yeah, I think she was marking my desk.

08:42.794 --> 08:44.845
She wanted to stay your partner.

08:44.845 --> 08:47.900
Well, hey, we got along okay.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.562
Believe it or not, she felt hamstrung
it made your case.

08:50.562 --> 08:52.598
She's training at Quantico.

08:53.678 --> 08:56.017
This should go over big with the feds.

08:57.885 --> 09:02.292
What? You gotta be kidding me.
$30 million. 30!

09:03.752 --> 09:06.732
This is Ted Regan you're dealing with here.
Not some pisser from Queens.

09:06.732 --> 09:08.774
Call me back when you grow a set.

09:10.111 --> 09:12.833
Sorry. Uh, what were we talking about?

09:12.833 --> 09:16.215
TK Richmond. He used to hit you
pretty hard in his column.

09:16.215 --> 09:20.886
He said your projects were bloated,
behind schedule, and over budget.

09:20.886 --> 09:23.622
My most recent projects,
he was a convert.

09:23.903 --> 09:26.384
Says I'm gonna be bigger than Donald Trump.

09:26.668 --> 09:28.837
So TK just saw the light?

09:29.470 --> 09:31.210
I do play to win.

09:31.210 --> 09:32.943
So did TK.

09:32.943 --> 09:35.577
- It turns out his column was for sale.
- Yeah.

09:35.577 --> 09:37.114
So is everything else in this town.

09:37.114 --> 09:39.511
Except TK used blackmail.

09:39.511 --> 09:42.948
You want me to research
what he had on you, Ted?

09:48.877 --> 09:51.035
TK was in a jam.
His sister moved in with him.

09:51.035 --> 09:52.119
They lived in a walk-up.

09:52.119 --> 09:53.850
So you gave them
one of your apartments.

09:53.850 --> 09:56.624
Yeah, it was a rental.
Legitimate lease.

09:56.624 --> 09:59.744
Stabilized. $1,100 a month.
Con Ed included.

09:59.744 --> 10:03.071
Wow. 2 bedrooms.
That's a steal.

10:03.071 --> 10:05.410
Yeah, I considered it
a long-term investment.

10:05.410 --> 10:08.583
Any other investments?
Maybe a restaurant?

10:09.038 --> 10:10.676
I might've put 100 into that.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.486
Why, he wasn't grateful
for how you helped him out?

10:13.486 --> 10:14.485
He pushed you?

10:14.485 --> 10:17.760
No, I pushed him, all right?

10:17.760 --> 10:20.614
I'm in the middle of a fight
with the City Planning Commission.

10:20.614 --> 10:22.530
I wanted him to bury anybody

10:22.530 --> 10:24.402
that was going to try and stop
Regan towers, all right?

10:24.402 --> 10:26.834
He dies now, not good.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.291
Not good at all.

10:28.734 --> 10:31.982
Listen, somebody in my business
would've killed him,

10:31.982 --> 10:33.857
you'd have never found the body.

10:37.195 --> 10:41.256
So my casino owner, your music exec,
and a real estate developer

10:41.256 --> 10:44.455
all claim to have good relationships with TK.

10:44.455 --> 10:45.642
Interesting.

10:45.642 --> 10:47.645
We underestimated the power of the press.

10:47.645 --> 10:50.604
He started out their extortionist,
ended up their publicist.

10:50.604 --> 10:53.301
Don't forget, he took in
half a million along the way.

10:53.301 --> 10:55.501
But the chef said
he hasn't seen a penny.

10:56.324 --> 11:00.116
Old car. Cheap rent.
What the hell did TK do with that money?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.121
He didn't need much.

11:02.121 --> 11:05.399
He said a gossip columnist
never had to pick up a check.

11:06.007 --> 11:09.002
I don't see any stocks or bonds.
Did he have property?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.801
No. He thought it would all crash.

11:12.536 --> 11:16.655
Um, excuse me.
I need to get ready. / Sure.

11:18.087 --> 11:19.621
How's his checking account?

11:19.621 --> 11:22.599
Up and down like a roller-coaster.

11:22.599 --> 11:29.353
Well, Rodgers said she didn't see
any drug habits except for pharmaceuticals.

11:29.353 --> 11:33.066
Big debits on Mondays in winter.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.473
How about spring?

11:36.143 --> 11:40.337
March, way down,
and then some deposits.

11:41.628 --> 11:44.512
Sunday football, March Madness,
April baseball.

11:44.512 --> 11:46.050
We may have a gambler here.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.341
Who was on a hot streak the last month.

11:50.809 --> 11:53.877
Whoa. Not enough to make up
for what he lost.

11:54.092 --> 11:56.278
I bet there's some angry bookies out there.

11:56.278 --> 11:59.583
I'm sorry, I don't want to keep
people waiting at the funeral.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.176
How about we give you a lift?

12:08.423 --> 12:11.039
New York is such a busy city.

12:11.039 --> 12:14.149
A lot of people just sent cards and bouquets.

12:15.296 --> 12:17.463
The arrangements are beautiful.

12:22.255 --> 12:26.984
Hey, three of his blackmail
victims sent flowers.

12:33.202 --> 12:35.711
- You know who I am?
- No.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.518
Does that look right to you?

12:38.754 --> 12:40.169
I'm not playing.

12:44.486 --> 12:45.518
Hey!

12:55.223 --> 12:57.291
Hey, hey, hey! You!

12:58.599 --> 12:59.946
You forget something?

13:03.825 --> 13:07.073
'K, Joey Snails.
You got a permit for that Browning?

13:07.073 --> 13:09.668
Look, guys, I got the diabetes.
I can't do anymore time.

13:09.668 --> 13:11.427
Can you give me
a little rhythm on this one?

13:11.427 --> 13:12.974
What were you doing at that service?

13:12.974 --> 13:14.202
Straight up?

13:14.202 --> 13:17.108
TK was a heavy duty gambler.
He owed my boss 50 large.

13:17.108 --> 13:18.354
Yeah, and now he's dead.

13:18.354 --> 13:20.083
Look, I had nothing to do with that.

13:20.447 --> 13:22.370
He's gone, makes it harder
for me to collect.

13:22.370 --> 13:24.152
I don't like bothering family at funerals.

13:24.152 --> 13:25.826
Besides, he was starting to dig out.

13:25.826 --> 13:27.186
TK didn't have any money.

13:27.186 --> 13:29.066
Did he say how he was working
his way back?

13:29.066 --> 13:31.849
We wouldn't take his book anymore.
But he had another runner in Chinatown.

13:31.849 --> 13:33.769
Last month or so, he got on a streak.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.623
- That's what he told you.
- Bragged about it.

13:35.623 --> 13:38.688
Said he had the inside line on which
players were doping to cover up injury.

13:38.688 --> 13:40.575
An inside line on just one team?

13:40.575 --> 13:43.622
No. Two sports.
Basketball and baseball.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.132
So is that enough?

13:45.392 --> 13:47.054
Sorry, Joey, but a gun's a gun.

13:47.054 --> 13:48.838
Can... can we get a bite?
I skipped breakfast.

13:48.838 --> 13:49.984
My sugars are crashing.

13:49.984 --> 13:53.492
We got a real nice brunch
down at One Police Plaza.

13:55.829 --> 13:58.257
TK never wrote about sports.

13:58.257 --> 13:59.639
Who's his inside line?

13:59.639 --> 14:02.682
I wonder if his "Dr. feelgood"
treated any athletes.

14:03.894 --> 14:06.188
The newer drugs never worked for TK.

14:06.608 --> 14:08.496
So I prescribed secobarbital.

14:08.496 --> 14:10.650
He liked that old Hollywood mystique.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.666
Dr. Jacoby, did TK ever ask you
about your other patients? Any athletes?

14:14.938 --> 14:16.319
Not that I can recall.

14:16.319 --> 14:18.030
But even if he did,
I can never talk about it.

14:18.030 --> 14:21.370
You know, doctor-patient confidentiality.
It's the law.

14:21.370 --> 14:26.140
Hey, listen. TK bragged that he had
inside information on players' injuries.

14:26.140 --> 14:31.124
So don't give us that doctor-patient
confidentiality crap. Okay?

14:31.124 --> 14:32.856
I'm a medical professional.

14:32.856 --> 14:35.467
Oh, then you wouldn't mind us
telling the state board

14:35.467 --> 14:37.954
that you're involved in
a homicide investigation.

14:37.954 --> 14:42.981
Detectives, call my lawyer if you
have any other questions.

14:46.402 --> 14:50.300
A doctor who keeps a criminal defense
lawyer's card in his pocket.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.299
Do you think that's a bad sign?

14:52.877 --> 14:54.432
I'd say so.

14:55.013 --> 14:56.761
Off the record, we got the records...

14:56.761 --> 15:01.587
Dr. Jacoby's name came up in a sports
steroids investigation a year and a half ago.

15:01.587 --> 15:04.550
The DEA's been tracking
his prescriptions ever since.

15:04.550 --> 15:07.492
And what a practice he has.

15:07.492 --> 15:11.201
Athletes juicing, musicians on painkillers.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.517
Actors on everything.

15:13.517 --> 15:15.441
Is that Spencer London?

15:15.441 --> 15:20.793
It was. Spencer London died
on a movie set in Louisiana last month.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.418
In one of his columns,
TK ran a blind item

15:24.418 --> 15:28.314
about a movie star in trouble down south.

15:29.477 --> 15:31.810
Here it is. Bayou Binge.

15:31.810 --> 15:34.853
"What film crew is worried
their male star is popping so many pills,

15:34.853 --> 15:36.885
he'll never make it to wrap."

15:37.427 --> 15:40.717
The press called Spencer's death
heart failure.

15:40.717 --> 15:42.707
What was Jacoby feeding him?

15:43.391 --> 15:44.709
Well...

15:48.592 --> 15:51.862
Um, here we go.

15:51.862 --> 15:56.736
Anti-anxiety. Antidepressants.
Sleeping pills. Painkillers.

15:56.736 --> 15:58.550
Anything for his heart?

15:59.001 --> 16:00.644
None of the above.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.891
Spencer dropped dead
before the movie finished shooting.

16:03.891 --> 16:06.126
Find out if TK visited the set.

16:20.125 --> 16:23.098
The movie is called Contract Man.

16:23.098 --> 16:25.409
We're hoping for a Christmas release.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.004
You were able to finish the shoot
after Spencer died?

16:29.004 --> 16:32.839
Well, we did need to use a double
for the last couple days of shooting.

16:32.839 --> 16:35.551
Look at Spencer.
Look at how great he looks.

16:35.551 --> 16:38.418
Given his history,
hiring him was risky.

16:38.418 --> 16:41.054
But I knew that he had this role in him.

16:41.054 --> 16:44.354
Ms. Tyson. If he looked so great,

16:44.354 --> 16:47.711
why did you have to fly
Dr. Jacoby down to the set to see him?

16:47.711 --> 16:51.318
Well, Spencer started to feel sick
towards the end of the shoot.

16:51.318 --> 16:54.570
but he was a real trooper.
He wanted us to stay on schedule.

16:54.570 --> 16:57.060
So the doctor gave him
a few B-12 shots.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.273
Some antibiotics.

16:58.273 --> 17:02.014
No. The doctor gave him
half a dozen schedule II drugs.

17:02.014 --> 17:04.892
We have the DEA records.
None of them were for his heart condition.

17:04.892 --> 17:05.987
Of course they weren't.

17:05.987 --> 17:09.337
His heart condition was congenital.
He never even knew about it.

17:09.337 --> 17:12.208
Did you see that blind item
about Spencer in TK's column?

17:12.208 --> 17:15.229
Those blind items can be about anyone.

17:15.229 --> 17:16.970
Was TK around during the shoot?

17:16.970 --> 17:20.534
No. He came down
for the memorial service.

17:20.534 --> 17:24.108
He flirted with a few extras.
He ate some alligator sausage.

17:24.108 --> 17:26.579
And then he went to New Orleans.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.281
He's a gossip columnist.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.829
And he never asked about your
"Dr. Feelgood" or Spencer's drug use?

17:31.829 --> 17:35.674
Honestly, this is the first time
I'm hearing about any of it.

17:36.253 --> 17:39.934
Spencer was giving
the performance of his life.

17:39.934 --> 17:44.713
And before you two showed up,
the only scandal surrounding his death

17:44.713 --> 17:49.771
was that he had a heart condition
that nobody knew about until it was too late.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.887
Spencer London
did have a fatal heart attack,

17:54.887 --> 17:58.148
and he did have a congenital defect.

17:58.937 --> 18:01.729
He died of an aortic aneurysm.

18:01.729 --> 18:04.139
It's like a bomb going off in your chest.

18:04.557 --> 18:07.601
The artery ruptured, and he was
probably dead in about 30 seconds.

18:07.601 --> 18:10.595
- It ruptured on its own.
- Well, it might have eventually.

18:10.595 --> 18:12.060
And it was a reasonable call

18:12.060 --> 18:14.711
until the tox screen
came back a few weeks later.

18:15.189 --> 18:17.864
And Spencer had
so many drugs in his system.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.691
It's a wonder his heart
didn't burst sooner.

18:20.691 --> 18:24.223
Why do all cops think if they just stayed
in school, they could've been doctors?

18:25.037 --> 18:26.579
So the coroner missed it.

18:26.579 --> 18:28.543
Well, not if you read the report.

18:28.543 --> 18:30.758
But by then, he'd already held
a press conference

18:30.758 --> 18:32.326
and announced the cause of death.

18:32.326 --> 18:35.455
And insurance claims had been filed,
body was in the ground,

18:35.455 --> 18:37.373
why not just bury the tox report with it.

18:37.373 --> 18:40.255
Wouldn't be the first time a Hollywood death
got hushed up.

18:41.781 --> 18:46.085
Detectives, I'm not a full-time coroner,
I'm just a country doctor.

18:46.085 --> 18:47.739
We're not high-tech.

18:47.739 --> 18:49.902
Tox screens don't come back in an hour.

18:49.902 --> 18:51.552
We get all that, Dr. Benway.

18:51.552 --> 18:54.819
We just don't understand why you announced
Spencer London's cause of death

18:54.819 --> 18:56.809
before his tests were done.

18:56.809 --> 18:58.982
Ma'am, you should've seen his heart.

18:58.982 --> 19:00.823
You'd a made the same call.

19:00.823 --> 19:04.576
Then why not correct that call
when his tox report came back?

19:04.576 --> 19:07.612
The man was gone.
Why hurt his family?

19:07.612 --> 19:10.770
Yeah, and besides, you'd already held
your press conference.

19:11.076 --> 19:14.800
Did a reporter named TK Richmond
question you after that conference?

19:14.800 --> 19:16.122
As a matter of fact, yes.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.685
He was one of those obnoxious New Yorkers.

19:18.685 --> 19:19.691
No offense.

19:19.691 --> 19:21.722
Oh, no offense taken.
How'd you handle him?

19:21.722 --> 19:24.311
I didn't.
The movie people took care of it.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.718
The movie people?

19:26.718 --> 19:27.930
Beverly Tyson?

19:27.930 --> 19:30.821
No. Her husband, Barry Freeburg.
He's head of the studio.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.025
And you called him?

19:32.025 --> 19:34.045
No, he came up to me
after the memorial.

19:34.045 --> 19:39.902
He was very interested in my experience
in helping the local victims of hurricane Katrina.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.507
He saw the cinematic possibilities.

19:43.507 --> 19:47.543
And what?
He thought it might make a movie?

19:47.543 --> 19:51.943
As a matter of fact, I'm writing
what Barry called a film treatment.

19:51.943 --> 19:54.089
It's like a blueprint.

19:54.678 --> 19:55.994
Yeah.

19:57.416 --> 20:00.224
Barry Freeburg's company, BFP films,

20:00.224 --> 20:03.701
is a silent partner on his wife's movie.
They're doing distribution.

20:03.701 --> 20:06.615
Now wait a minute.
Let's try to put this together here.

20:06.615 --> 20:10.019
All right, so this producer broad,
Beverly Tyson,

20:10.019 --> 20:13.685
her star OD's on company-supplied drugs.

20:13.685 --> 20:17.338
Her husband Barry blows into town,
tries to do damage control.

20:17.338 --> 20:20.648
Bribes the country doctor
to give a clean bill of death.

20:20.648 --> 20:23.302
And then tries to make the deal with TK.

20:23.302 --> 20:25.793
But TK's a shark and he's in the hole.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.471
So he gets greedy.

20:28.998 --> 20:30.907
And then he gets the back
of his head blown off.

20:49.512 --> 20:51.327
That was fantastic.

20:51.741 --> 20:54.406
Just great. Just great.

20:54.406 --> 20:56.621
Mr. Freeburg, do you still want me
to pass by your office?

20:56.621 --> 20:58.279
Sure, sure.
End of the day on Friday.

20:58.279 --> 21:01.082
Talk to my assistant.
She'll set the whole thing up.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.052
Mr. Freeburg, we talked to your office.

21:05.052 --> 21:08.495
Yeah, right, right, right.
The detectives about TK.

21:08.495 --> 21:11.043
Yeah, terrible, terrible tragedy.

21:11.043 --> 21:12.680
You must've known him a long time.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.686
Sure, yeah, yeah. I'd see him
at all the openings and all the parties.

21:16.686 --> 21:17.978
He was on everybody's list.

21:17.978 --> 21:21.288
Is that how he ended up as Spencer
London's memorial in Louisiana?

21:21.288 --> 21:23.580
Another tragedy.
So young.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.914
Who knew the guy
was a walking time bomb?

21:26.914 --> 21:28.894
Heart's a mysterious organ.

21:30.034 --> 21:32.338
It may've been more than his heart.

21:32.338 --> 21:35.289
We spoke to the doctor
who performed the autopsy.

21:35.604 --> 21:36.971
Really?

21:36.971 --> 21:40.659
I'm surprised Benway would give up
Spencer's privacy like that.

21:40.659 --> 21:43.290
Didn't you get him a screenplay deal?

21:43.290 --> 21:44.714
Katrina Nights.

21:44.714 --> 21:48.127
Sure, sure, sure.
That doc's got amazing stories.

21:48.127 --> 21:51.143
I mean, imagine you have to decide
which patient you save

21:51.143 --> 21:52.890
before the waters come in.

21:52.890 --> 21:56.347
Imagine having to choose whether or not
to go public with a tox screen

21:56.347 --> 21:58.153
when you have a movie deal.

21:58.153 --> 22:00.727
Just trying to save Spencer's
family from the vultures.

22:00.727 --> 22:03.033
- Like TK Richmond?
- Yeah, TK.

22:03.033 --> 22:06.769
He planted those blind items
just to get me going, you know?

22:06.769 --> 22:08.932
We talked about it,
came to an agreement.

22:08.932 --> 22:10.376
He moved on to other stories.

22:10.376 --> 22:12.383
And you're saying
he didn't come back at you?

22:12.383 --> 22:14.994
Come on, from what we hear about TK,
he liked to, you know,

22:14.994 --> 22:16.676
squeeze the lemon till it exploded.

22:16.676 --> 22:19.952
What are you saying,
that I planted the bomb?

22:20.666 --> 22:23.577
Come on.
I can't even program my own DVR.

22:23.577 --> 22:25.704
But you do know how
to make screenplay deals.

22:25.704 --> 22:28.854
Very good, Detective.
Very good. Okay.

22:28.854 --> 22:30.644
Maybe I should give you a deal.

22:30.644 --> 22:33.201
You gotta look at the second act of your life.
Can't be a cop forever.

22:33.201 --> 22:35.436
And I know you've got stories.

22:35.436 --> 22:37.247
I got a few stories all right.

22:37.247 --> 22:39.334
But let's get back to TK's deal, okay?

22:39.334 --> 22:40.882
Okay, TK...

22:40.882 --> 22:45.269
It was, uh, before the memorial
I gave him 50 grand. Totally legit.

22:45.269 --> 22:46.646
He turn in a script?

22:46.646 --> 22:48.544
Naw, just a pitch.

22:48.544 --> 22:52.411
Writers, you know?
They got a lot of problems with deadlines.

22:52.411 --> 22:55.762
All right, um, listen,
I gotta get back to the girls.

22:55.762 --> 22:59.187
I hope I helped you.
Nice meeting you. Take care.

23:00.214 --> 23:05.682
The sweet smell of success.
"I love this dirty town."

23:05.682 --> 23:08.822
Burt Lancaster. Played a corrupt
gossip columnist.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.761
If he didn't have the goods on someone,
he's make them up.

23:11.761 --> 23:14.560
Anybody want to murder
the gossip columnist?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.033
Everybody.

23:16.459 --> 23:19.256
Makes you wonder
what TK's version was about.

23:20.377 --> 23:24.434
Screenplay?
My brother wasn't writing a screenplay.

23:24.434 --> 23:26.927
He might've been doing
some research for it down south.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.265
- His trip to New Orleans?
- Yeah.

23:29.265 --> 23:32.677
You said he didn't take notes,
but did he bring anything back?

23:32.677 --> 23:35.283
Uh, he brought me
some Mardi Gras beads.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.500
That's it?

23:36.500 --> 23:38.744
No, um, one more thing.

23:41.354 --> 23:44.702
Alligator sausage.
Does that help?

23:45.583 --> 23:49.618
I never got to try it.
TK said it tasted like chicken.

23:52.061 --> 23:53.516
Yeah.

23:54.530 --> 23:56.247
Only gamier.

23:56.247 --> 24:00.517
"Select dailies from Contract Man."
The Spencer London movie.

24:02.913 --> 24:04.228
Action.

24:06.750 --> 24:07.934
Whoa.

24:11.071 --> 24:12.412
- Cut.
- Damn it.

24:12.412 --> 24:15.329
Guy can't even walk straight.
What is this, a blooper reel?

24:15.329 --> 24:16.675
Keep rolling. I can do this.

24:16.675 --> 24:18.708
More like a blackmail reel.

24:18.708 --> 24:21.558
Here's Spencer trying to hide
a bomb in a tape deck.

24:23.912 --> 24:25.787
It's the opening, it's too small.

24:25.787 --> 24:27.689
I mean who the hell built this piece of...

24:27.689 --> 24:30.417
- Don't laugh at me.
- This guy's a disaster.

24:30.417 --> 24:32.939
What did he... blow up the boat
by accident?

24:32.939 --> 24:34.873
No, it's part of the plot.

24:35.326 --> 24:37.346
He's supposed to be a contract killer.

24:37.346 --> 24:40.690
He blew up this jogger on that boat.

24:41.463 --> 24:43.665
Jogger on a boat.
Wait a minute.

24:43.665 --> 24:47.280
The bomb's in that cassette player,
if he could ever get it in.

24:48.311 --> 24:52.302
Oh, the explosion was triggered
by a tape deck.

24:52.302 --> 24:54.112
I wonder when they figured that out.

24:54.112 --> 24:57.409
- Logan, it's a movie.
- No, no, no, no.

24:57.409 --> 25:00.074
This movie is based on a real case.

25:00.074 --> 25:03.851
When I was a white shield,
a guy comes back from a jog,

25:03.851 --> 25:06.563
gets blown up on his house boat.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.512
I didn't know they solved it.

25:18.025 --> 25:19.597
It's pretty clever.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.362
Yep, this is it.

25:23.362 --> 25:25.992
Tony Fabre, heir to a supermarket chain.

25:25.992 --> 25:29.695
Some mob ties.
Killed by a boat bomb.

25:30.147 --> 25:31.504
When did you guys break this?

25:31.504 --> 25:34.894
We didn't. It's still an open case.
Bomb squad found traces of C4,

25:34.894 --> 25:36.573
but we could never figure out
how the trigger worked.

25:36.573 --> 25:38.204
Could it have been set off
by a tape deck?

25:38.204 --> 25:40.565
There was one on-board,
a Marantz, just like in your movie.

25:40.565 --> 25:43.726
And in everybody's den in those days.
My dad had one too.

25:43.726 --> 25:46.497
In the movie, the victim presses play
to trigger the bomb.

25:46.497 --> 25:49.421
TK pushes in a cigarette lighter.
Are we talking about the same bomber?

25:49.421 --> 25:51.745
Same explosive,
similar behind-the-panel trigger.

25:51.745 --> 25:52.899
It's a possible signature.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.941
Hello, one of these bombers is fictional.

25:54.941 --> 25:57.532
The writer probably read
some articles and made the rest up.

25:57.532 --> 25:59.920
No, I don't think so.
Fabre went out for a jog.

25:59.920 --> 26:03.089
He was wearing a Walkman.
That's information we never released.

26:03.089 --> 26:06.421
You track down your screenwriter,
the bomb squad would like a word with him.

26:07.147 --> 26:09.942
Contract Man was in
development for five years.

26:09.942 --> 26:13.133
I... I'm the seventh writer
working with the third director.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.879
It's not your original story.

26:14.879 --> 26:17.667
I'm miles from what they started with.

26:17.667 --> 26:19.981
I'm taking it to arbitration for sole credit.

26:19.981 --> 26:23.347
The bomb on the boat,
you know, in the tape deck.

26:23.347 --> 26:24.560
Was that your idea?

26:24.560 --> 26:26.973
Uh, that was from the first draft.

26:26.973 --> 26:28.660
Well, how about the victim
that was out jogging?

26:28.660 --> 26:30.752
You know, with the walkman.
You?

26:30.752 --> 26:33.927
Um, I... I think that was
from the first draft, too.

26:33.927 --> 26:35.594
But I did a lot to set it up.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.444
The original structure sucked.

26:38.444 --> 26:40.466
Who wrote that first draft?

26:40.466 --> 26:41.720
Uh...

26:47.344 --> 26:51.658
Francesco X. Cesare
is the name on the title page.

26:51.658 --> 26:54.776
I never heard of the guy.
Bev might know how to reach him.

26:54.776 --> 26:58.022
Beverly Tyson, the producer?
She brought you this story?

26:58.022 --> 26:59.179
And twisted my arm.

26:59.179 --> 27:02.028
Kept saying this was
her big passion project.

27:02.634 --> 27:05.568
First writer of Contract Man.

27:05.568 --> 27:07.318
Uh, could you...

27:09.678 --> 27:12.837
What does that have to do
with TK's murder?

27:12.837 --> 27:15.312
We're not sure, but we're trying
to get in touch with him.

27:15.312 --> 27:17.346
That can't happen.

27:17.346 --> 27:18.842
Frank is dead.

27:18.842 --> 27:22.112
He died right after we optioned the script.

27:22.112 --> 27:24.347
Oh, that's too bad.

27:24.347 --> 27:26.239
You remember how he died?

27:26.239 --> 27:31.451
Uh, I think it was a car accident
about five years ago out in Long Island.

27:31.451 --> 27:33.157
It was a very sad story.

27:33.157 --> 27:35.140
Contract Man was his first screenplay.

27:35.140 --> 27:37.179
I never even got a chance to meet him.

27:37.179 --> 27:38.736
Then how did you find it?

27:38.736 --> 27:40.566
It was in the slush pile.

27:40.566 --> 27:44.121
It's, uh, scripts that are submitted
without an agent.

27:44.121 --> 27:47.247
I like to slog through them
looking for a pearl,

27:47.247 --> 27:49.972
and something about this one
just grabbed me.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.958
You ever ask him who it was based on?

27:51.958 --> 27:55.045
I never got the chance.
It's too bad.

27:55.045 --> 27:57.475
He would've had a brilliant career.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.899
- Boy, can she spin a story.
- Yeah.

28:03.454 --> 28:05.599
Only one thing doesn't track.

28:05.951 --> 28:10.630
If she never met Francesco Cesare,
how come she called him Frank?

28:13.013 --> 28:16.203
We can't find a Francesco X. Cesare
in the writers' guild.

28:16.203 --> 28:18.411
And there's no record of
anyone by that name

28:18.411 --> 28:21.848
dying in a car accident
in Long Island ever.

28:22.649 --> 28:24.222
Why would she lie about that?

28:24.222 --> 28:25.764
That's what we were wondering.

28:25.764 --> 28:29.464
So we took another look at Bev Tyson.

28:29.464 --> 28:33.402
Turns out her birth name was Beverly
Banducci of Todt Hill, Staten Island.

28:33.402 --> 28:35.828
Nice family, Catholic schools,

28:35.828 --> 28:37.942
father owns a dry cleaner,
nothing hinky.

28:37.942 --> 28:40.014
Not until she's 18

28:40.014 --> 28:43.159
when she gets collared
for shoplifting at the local mall.

28:44.846 --> 28:48.518
Wouldn't be the first time a Catholic
school girl goes bad for a while.

28:48.518 --> 28:51.090
Yeah, but look who she was arrested with.

28:51.625 --> 28:53.376
Frank Chess.

28:53.376 --> 28:55.778
AKA Francesco Cesare.

28:55.778 --> 28:58.890
We think it's the name he wrote under
to make himself sound more authentic.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.251
Do we have anything more
on Frank Chess?

29:01.251 --> 29:02.970
Oh, yeah, you bet.

29:02.970 --> 29:05.455
He's a capo in the Severini crime family.

29:05.455 --> 29:08.117
Pushed the button on seven guys,
never got convicted.

29:08.117 --> 29:09.232
Any bombings?

29:09.232 --> 29:11.881
Suspect in two, and one car bombing.

29:11.881 --> 29:15.840
Five years ago, Chess got jammed up,
testified against his associates.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.369
A month later, he dies in a car crash.

29:18.369 --> 29:20.860
Here's a copy of the death certificate.

29:21.643 --> 29:25.646
Only problem is, local precinct has
no record of the crash.

29:27.508 --> 29:29.991
Because there was none.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.652
Feds faked this as a cover.

29:33.971 --> 29:36.096
In Contract Man,
Spencer London's character

29:36.096 --> 29:39.199
goes into witness protection
after his last hit.

29:39.199 --> 29:42.247
Spencer played it,
but Frank Chess lived it.

29:42.247 --> 29:45.830
And then his high school girlfriend
made a movie about him.

29:45.830 --> 29:48.150
It's a real passion project.

30:14.296 --> 30:17.105
Logan, Wheeler, meet
US Marshal Mary Shannon.

30:17.105 --> 30:19.404
She's with the federal
witness protection program.

30:19.404 --> 30:20.787
Detectives.

30:20.787 --> 30:23.931
We caught a break.
Mary's in town transporting a witness,

30:23.931 --> 30:26.782
and she was Frank Chess'
WITSEC inspector.

30:26.782 --> 30:29.102
Oh, so what can you tell us
about Chess?

30:29.102 --> 30:32.135
Total pain in the ass.
Typical little dick tough guy.

30:32.135 --> 30:34.437
And you relocated him to Albuquerque?

30:34.437 --> 30:35.580
Five years ago.

30:35.580 --> 30:37.918
Mope stepped off the plane
bitching about the dry heat

30:37.918 --> 30:40.145
and demanding we import him
real sopressata.

30:40.145 --> 30:41.545
How long did he last?

30:41.545 --> 30:44.204
Maybe three years,
then he went off the reservation.

30:44.204 --> 30:46.453
We wrote him out of the program
for noncompliance.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.006
That must've hurt his feelings.

30:48.006 --> 30:50.443
- You have any idea where he is now?
- No, not a clue.

30:50.443 --> 30:52.429
If you find him,
don't let the smile fool you.

30:52.429 --> 30:53.654
Guy's a psychopath.

30:53.654 --> 30:55.694
Sound like you miss him.
You want in on the hunt?

30:55.694 --> 30:57.289
Oh, I wish I could.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.502
I'm due back in Albuquerque
by 10:00 tonight.

30:59.502 --> 31:01.741
- Thanks.
- See ya.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.585
She's a slice.

31:04.585 --> 31:07.200
I wonder what you do in Albuquerque
on a Sunday night at 10:00.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.672
Not your problem.
Just track down Frank Chess.

31:09.672 --> 31:12.386
Already started with Bev.
I've just got her phone records.

31:12.386 --> 31:14.019
So who's in her top five?

31:14.019 --> 31:18.350
Most calls are in Santa Monica,
Beverly Hills, Vail.

31:18.350 --> 31:20.045
And here we go.

31:20.045 --> 31:24.111
A number of long calls to Wet Works
Auto Detailing and Custom Sound.

31:24.111 --> 31:26.042
Margate, New Jersey.

31:26.042 --> 31:28.310
Right next door to Atlantic City.

31:28.310 --> 31:30.655
Take the boy out of the mob, but...

31:36.986 --> 31:38.306
Hold it, Frank.

31:38.532 --> 31:40.291
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

31:40.291 --> 31:43.072
Frank Chess, we're offering you
a free ride back to the city.

31:43.072 --> 31:46.327
Hey, where's your warrant?
What's your probable cause?

31:47.119 --> 31:50.659
Here's our warrant,
and there's my probable cause.

31:53.862 --> 31:56.841
You guys are making a mistake.
I'm in the program.

31:56.841 --> 31:58.667
Not anymore. Let's go.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.052
We'll stop by little Italy
on the way back,

32:01.052 --> 32:02.869
pick you up some sopressata.

32:10.237 --> 32:11.698
Who's that?

32:11.989 --> 32:13.596
Frank Chess.

32:14.689 --> 32:17.725
Francesco Cesare, your screenwriter.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.104
I've never seen him before.

32:24.578 --> 32:27.041
You wanna try another take?

32:36.045 --> 32:38.136
Does my husband know about this?

32:38.136 --> 32:42.869
Your husband? Oh, lady,
that is the least of your problems.

32:42.869 --> 32:44.972
You've been doing nothing but lying to us.

32:44.972 --> 32:46.730
You know you're up
for a murder charge here?

32:46.730 --> 32:48.266
- Murder?
- Yeah.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.447
What are you talking about?

32:49.447 --> 32:52.516
I... I just didn't want my husband
to find out about me and Frank.

32:52.516 --> 32:54.395
You're having an affair with him?

32:57.624 --> 33:00.571
Take it slow.
When did it start?

33:00.571 --> 33:02.244
Should I call a lawyer?

33:02.244 --> 33:05.141
Uh... You know any
won't call your husband?

33:08.482 --> 33:11.520
I hadn't seen Frank since high school.

33:12.685 --> 33:16.533
He got in touch with me
when he went into the program.

33:16.790 --> 33:19.988
He was out west and he was bored.

33:19.988 --> 33:21.545
He sent me a script.

33:21.545 --> 33:25.248
I visited him on my way to Sundance.

33:25.248 --> 33:30.334
We would meet sometimes
at a little spa in Taos.

33:30.334 --> 33:33.774
And then twice a year
wasn't enough for us.

33:34.153 --> 33:36.709
He left witness protection for you?

33:36.709 --> 33:38.988
He's crazy about me.

33:39.916 --> 33:43.586
And I'd forgotten what it was like,
to feel wanted like that.

33:43.586 --> 33:47.009
I can't even get Barry
to turn off his BlackBerry.

33:47.009 --> 33:48.844
Barry doesn't know
about you and Frank.

33:48.844 --> 33:52.844
He knew that Frank had sent me a script
that I was excited about.

33:52.844 --> 33:55.055
It wasn't just about the sex.

33:55.055 --> 33:57.738
It was the whole life that Frank had led,

33:57.738 --> 33:59.835
the aura of danger.

33:59.835 --> 34:02.037
The aura of danger?

34:02.536 --> 34:04.559
This help you to get off?

34:06.365 --> 34:08.050
Oh, my God.

34:09.928 --> 34:16.518
No, you have to understand.
Frank... he left that life behind him.

34:17.291 --> 34:21.856
You can't believe that he would
do something like this to TK.

34:22.396 --> 34:27.911
Listen, you got a stone-cold killer
to leave witness protection for you.

34:27.911 --> 34:29.837
You never wondered what else
he might do for you?

34:29.837 --> 34:34.382
No, not my Frankie. No.

34:38.675 --> 34:41.029
You think that's the story of my life?

34:41.705 --> 34:43.121
You got some imagination.

34:43.121 --> 34:46.242
Come on, Frank. We found 20 ounces
of C4 in your garage

34:46.242 --> 34:48.170
and a trigger mechanism in a BlackBerry.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.090
Barry Freeburg next on your hit parade?

34:50.090 --> 34:51.585
I don't know about any of this.

34:51.585 --> 34:54.926
It's not like we haven't
done the math, Frank. Come on.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.532
We know you're crazy about Bev,

34:57.532 --> 35:02.345
and we know that Bev didn't want TK
writing about Spencer London's overdose.

35:03.573 --> 35:05.642
Bevie had nothing to do with it.

35:06.389 --> 35:10.544
TK got sparked because he figured out
that the movie was based on me.

35:11.405 --> 35:13.279
He was gonna out me.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.795
There's a lot of people
wanna know where I am.

35:15.795 --> 35:17.784
How'd you know he was gonna out you?

35:18.430 --> 35:22.250
I overheard Bev talking
to her husband on the phone.

35:22.550 --> 35:24.616
She thought I was still in the shower.

35:27.170 --> 35:32.390
So you decided completely
on your own to kill TK.

35:34.937 --> 35:38.999
Gimme a pen and paper.
I'll start writing right now.

35:43.903 --> 35:45.994
Well, the DA should be happy.

35:45.994 --> 35:48.518
- But you're not?
- They're both lying.

35:48.518 --> 35:51.098
TK didn't take notes.
Didn't do research.

35:51.098 --> 35:55.026
How likely is it he found out
Frank Chess was the Contract Man?

35:55.026 --> 35:56.903
So what are we saying here?

35:57.524 --> 36:01.025
That Bev and Barry tricked
Frank into killing TK?

36:02.656 --> 36:05.502
Unless TK had something else on him.

36:05.832 --> 36:08.079
Something money couldn't fix.

36:08.926 --> 36:09.886
What have you got?

36:09.886 --> 36:12.640
TK on tape the night he died.

36:12.933 --> 36:16.392
It's not like you tried
to take advantage of some nun

36:16.392 --> 36:18.697
or some naive little high school girl.

36:18.697 --> 36:22.265
Some bum does that,
there's not enough money in the world...

36:22.265 --> 36:25.084
- TK have a soft spot for nuns?
- No.

36:25.724 --> 36:29.471
But his sister Jeannie,
a naive high school girl,

36:29.471 --> 36:32.372
who wants to be an actress.

36:33.963 --> 36:36.746
Wheeler, give her a shoulder.

36:39.236 --> 36:44.037
Now that TK's gone.
I have to go live with my aunt in Maine.

36:44.037 --> 36:46.714
What about the performing arts high school?

36:48.026 --> 36:50.895
I don't really want to be
an actress anymore.

36:51.740 --> 36:56.155
I'll just study something else,
like veterinary science.

36:57.105 --> 37:00.688
Jeannie, you're the one thing
in the world your brother cared about.

37:00.688 --> 37:03.465
No matter what anyone else says,

37:03.726 --> 37:06.135
he always looked out for me.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.152
Then you need to look out for him.

37:09.718 --> 37:12.113
You said you don't want to act anymore.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.735
What made you change your mind?

37:14.735 --> 37:17.554
Just too hard to break in.

37:18.681 --> 37:21.052
But your brother knew everyone.

37:22.250 --> 37:24.705
Couldn't he help you get auditions?

37:26.382 --> 37:28.711
Maybe with Barry Freeburg?

37:29.583 --> 37:31.175
He did.

37:33.566 --> 37:35.791
You met him at the soundstage?

37:35.791 --> 37:37.931
I was supposed to.

37:40.403 --> 37:44.785
But Mr. Freeburg asked me
to come by his office instead.

37:47.293 --> 37:49.993
5:30 on Friday.

37:52.188 --> 37:55.782
He asked all of his assistants
to go home.

37:55.782 --> 37:58.176
Do I have to talk about this?

37:58.665 --> 38:00.229
It's okay.

38:01.581 --> 38:03.911
I was 16 once.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.912
Just tell me what you told TK.

38:12.119 --> 38:15.133
I didn't have to tell him anything.

38:18.443 --> 38:20.176
He just looked at my face

38:20.176 --> 38:23.433
and he knew that something
really bad had happened.

38:28.566 --> 38:31.305
So TK leverages Spencer's drug overdose,

38:31.305 --> 38:34.759
not just for money,
but also to get his sister an audition.

38:34.759 --> 38:38.817
Then Barry gets back at TK.
By bending his sister over the couch.

38:40.329 --> 38:41.522
Nice people.

38:41.522 --> 38:44.948
And when TK puts it together,
he must've been out for Barry's blood.

38:45.289 --> 38:47.315
TK's dead, Frank's in jail.

38:47.315 --> 38:50.244
How come Barry's the last man standing?

38:50.244 --> 38:51.682
I'll tell you what.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.825
I'll ask him.

38:54.658 --> 38:58.033
You said you wanted to talk in private,
detective. No lawyers, no partners.

38:58.033 --> 38:59.109
What's on your mind?

38:59.109 --> 39:01.558
We just made an arrest on TK's murder.

39:01.558 --> 39:04.676
Organized crime guy
by the name of Frank Chess.

39:05.159 --> 39:08.272
Good to know but
why the special trip?

39:08.272 --> 39:11.223
Well, the DA believes that
the movie your wife was producing

39:11.223 --> 39:14.123
was based on Frank Chess's life.

39:14.123 --> 39:18.404
Chess killed TK to keep his whereabouts
out of the gossip column.

39:18.990 --> 39:21.012
My god, does Bev know any of this?

39:21.012 --> 39:25.504
You should ask her about that.
There's something else I found out.

39:25.504 --> 39:30.711
Something that I haven't shared with the DA
or even my partner yet.

39:30.711 --> 39:32.335
What's that?

39:33.942 --> 39:38.816
This is the signed statement
from TK's younger sister Jeanie.

39:39.654 --> 39:41.902
She says you raped her.

39:46.305 --> 39:48.016
It's all lies.

39:48.458 --> 39:51.237
She's a shakedown artist,
just like her brother.

39:51.237 --> 39:53.232
What really did happen?

39:53.232 --> 39:56.722
Okay, uh...
TK demanded I give her a part.

39:56.722 --> 39:59.404
She comes over
with a skirt up to here.

39:59.404 --> 40:02.058
She starts working it.
It's late at night.

40:02.058 --> 40:03.619
We're alone.

40:03.619 --> 40:05.223
What do I look like, Gandhi?

40:05.223 --> 40:06.879
So the sex was consensual.

40:06.879 --> 40:08.388
Absolutely.

40:09.906 --> 40:11.922
Thing is...

40:12.495 --> 40:17.025
Jeannie was 16.
She just hit 17 last week.

40:17.025 --> 40:18.787
I had no idea.

40:18.787 --> 40:22.448
- Believe me, if you'd seen this girl...
- Oh, I saw her all right.

40:23.207 --> 40:26.906
Problem is we're talking
statutory rape, Barry.

40:26.906 --> 40:29.275
This isn't just a publicity nightmare.

40:29.275 --> 40:31.917
You're looking at a serious
criminal charge.

40:31.917 --> 40:33.663
Do I have to be?

40:34.049 --> 40:36.505
How about some breakfast, Detective?

40:36.505 --> 40:39.234
Yeah, I'm feeling a little hungry.

40:39.894 --> 40:42.262
You been at this a long time, huh?

40:43.015 --> 40:45.427
Seems like my whole life.

40:45.427 --> 40:49.263
When we were talking the other day
about your second act,

40:49.263 --> 40:53.283
I can't imagine the department
is, uh, grooming you for management.

40:53.551 --> 40:55.465
It's not my style anyway.

40:55.465 --> 40:57.379
I'm just thinking out loud here.

40:57.379 --> 40:59.817
You know those stories
you told me about the other day?

40:59.817 --> 41:01.701
Any of them make a good movie?

41:01.701 --> 41:03.106
I'm not a writer, Barry.

41:03.106 --> 41:05.008
Oh, I got writers.

41:05.008 --> 41:08.367
I need your street smarts.
Your soul.

41:08.367 --> 41:10.481
Yeah, well, you can have that.

41:11.871 --> 41:16.716
But, uh, there's someone else
that could use some attention too, the girl.

41:17.219 --> 41:19.697
Well, she's in a needy place.

41:19.697 --> 41:22.197
I... I definitely want to help her out.

41:22.197 --> 41:24.577
Just so there's no hard feelings.

41:26.859 --> 41:30.005
So we have an understanding.

41:35.595 --> 41:37.941
Yeah, we do.

41:37.941 --> 41:40.227
But there's someone I want to be
straight up with you about.

41:40.227 --> 41:41.717
Go ahead. We're partners.

41:41.717 --> 41:44.671
Okay. Frank Chess.

41:46.049 --> 41:47.974
He was doing your wife.

41:47.974 --> 41:49.893
Sorry I have to be the one
to tell you that.

41:49.893 --> 41:52.008
You think I didn't know that?

41:52.008 --> 41:54.483
- What do I look like a chump?
- What do you mean?

41:54.483 --> 41:57.196
You don't get to be the head
of a major studio

41:57.196 --> 42:01.388
by being too dumb to realize
when there's another clown in the tent.

42:01.388 --> 42:02.898
So you just let it go on?

42:02.898 --> 42:04.604
I filed it away.

42:04.604 --> 42:08.874
I knew that eventually I'd get more out
of Frank than she ever would.

42:08.874 --> 42:12.583
Well, just how did you get Frank
to take care of TK anyway?

42:12.583 --> 42:15.071
It's like putting together a movie.

42:15.071 --> 42:18.484
All you gotta do is know
how to package the elements.

42:18.748 --> 42:21.751
I told her that her lover was in trouble,

42:21.751 --> 42:24.014
and she's very proactive.

42:24.014 --> 42:25.801
Frank swore he acted on his own.

42:25.801 --> 42:28.293
Yeah, for now.
But he's a rat.

42:28.293 --> 42:31.839
Once he finds out she put him up to it,
he'll turn on her.

42:31.839 --> 42:34.114
So you put out the contract,

42:34.114 --> 42:36.363
and those two had no idea
they were being played.

42:36.363 --> 42:37.382
That's very good.

42:37.382 --> 42:38.857
That's what I do.

42:38.857 --> 42:41.920
No one gets over on Barry Freeburg.

42:41.920 --> 42:46.973
Not my wife, not Frank,
not that little bottom feeder TK.

42:46.973 --> 42:50.385
That son of a bitch was gonna keep on
grinding me down,

42:50.385 --> 42:52.364
so I gave his sister an audition.

42:52.364 --> 42:56.537
I gave her the part of a lifetime.

42:58.075 --> 43:00.430
Detective, if you're thinking
you're getting over on me,

43:00.430 --> 43:02.476
you're not, cause I got your number.

43:02.476 --> 43:03.564
How's that?

43:03.564 --> 43:05.612
Oh, how's that? Let's see,

43:05.612 --> 43:10.852
I've got you recorded accepting a bribe
and agreeing to a cover-up.

43:15.415 --> 43:17.578
Right back at you, pal.

43:18.780 --> 43:21.908
Statutory rape and felony murder.

43:24.746 --> 43:26.344
Barry Freeburg, you're under arrest.

43:26.344 --> 43:29.533
Okay, this'll never hold up.
This is entrapment, pure and simple.

43:29.533 --> 43:31.144
You know, when I get out
from underneath this,

43:31.144 --> 43:34.680
you better watch out cause I got
a lot of friends around town.

43:37.900 --> 43:41.191
- Nice house.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:41.191 --> 43:44.885
Well, so much for my second act.
