It's just, this has been

16:20.179 --> 16:23.000

that this is,

16:26.110 --> 16:29.120
like, a thing.

16:31.059 --> 16:35.159
Well, maybe we can just, like,

16:31.059 --> 16:35.159
take a step back, and, like --

16:35.179 --> 16:37.139
and, like, take it

I threw it away.

17:44.059 --> 17:46.150
What? Why?

Because, uh...

17:48.230 --> 17:52.089
I'm a kleptomaniac.

17:52.109 --> 17:53.150
Yeah.

17:53.170 --> 17:55.029
I'm -- I'm really

17:53.170 --> 17:55.029
ashamed of it,

17:55.049 --> 17:56.160
and it's hard for me

17:55.049 --> 17:56.160
to admit it.

17:56.180 --> 17:59.069
But when I look at the

17:56.180 --> 17:59.069
obelisk in my house,

17:59.089 --> 18:01.019
I'm reminded

17:59.089 --> 18:01.019
of my problem.

18:01.039 --> 18:06.029
So, I took it,

18:01.039 --> 18:06.029
