00:36.858 --> 00:39.360
<i>And now back to Disney's "Gargoyles."</i>

00:39.361 --> 00:41.373
Please stop saying that

00:41.408 --> 00:43.464
- every time we start to have sex.
- Honey, come on.

00:43.531 --> 00:45.992
We are unattractive
people. I'm just owning it.

00:45.993 --> 00:48.909
Find McClane and bring me my detonators.

00:48.944 --> 00:51.138
Unless you want it to get
messy out there, I suggest you

00:51.206 --> 00:54.675
start organizing trips to the bathroom.
And FYI ... the East bathroom is

00:54.776 --> 00:57.544
- being redone and only has a urinal.
- Fine.

00:59.639 --> 01:02.700
Attention. If you are a male
who has to go pee really,

01:02.701 --> 01:04.985
really bad, raise your
hand and keep it raised.

01:05.053 --> 01:06.754
<i>This is your bathroom pass.</i>

01:06.755 --> 01:10.157
When your group color is called,
you must show the leader your

01:10.258 --> 01:13.400
pass before your group can
proceed to the bathroom.

01:13.401 --> 01:15.943
If you are a woman who has to go poo,

01:15.978 --> 01:18.306
you are in the aqua group.

01:18.307 --> 01:22.566
<i>Hey, Hans, I just took a dump
in the East bathroom urinal.</i>

01:22.567 --> 01:25.362
Regroup! Everyone
hand back your laminates.

01:26.097 --> 01:29.443
Uh, this is the source of the
transmission, but nobody's here.

01:29.511 --> 01:33.046
Should a couple of space truckers be
making first contact with an alien ship?

01:33.114 --> 01:35.961
Sorry it's so messy!
It's hard to get maid

01:35.972 --> 01:39.086
- service in space!
- Who are you?

01:39.153 --> 01:43.090
My name's Gordon Shumway.
I crash-landed here. How ironic!

01:43.157 --> 01:47.761
My ship goes down, my insurance
premium goes up!

01:47.829 --> 01:50.898
That was hilarious. Maybe we
should take him back to the Nostromo.

01:50.965 --> 01:54.334
<i>Ripley here. Quarantine procedure
says we are forbidden from bringing any</i>

01:54.402 --> 01:58.438
- alien life form on board, Kane.
- Thanks, Captain Paranoid of the S.S. "Rules"!

01:58.540 --> 02:01.630
We're bringing this
hilarious mother[bleep] aboard.

02:01.631 --> 02:03.176
Ooh, nice outfit, Brett.

02:03.244 --> 02:07.381
I didn't know there was a
goodwill in space!

02:07.482 --> 02:10.662
This guy's jokes are obvious.
I want him off the ship.

02:10.663 --> 02:14.260
The crazy cat lady who
doesn't want us to have any fun

02:14.261 --> 02:17.858
doesn't want us to have any fun?
I'm gobsmacked.

02:17.926 --> 02:23.931
Seriously, Brett, I dress better
than you, and I'm naked!

02:26.568 --> 02:29.136
Whoa!
Someone get that guy a tums!

02:29.203 --> 02:31.939
I can't not laugh at this guy.

02:32.006 --> 02:35.859
Your friend just choked to death! Your
shitty jokes are going to kill my crew.

02:35.860 --> 02:38.111
Can't you see, Ripley?
He's the perfect organism.

02:38.179 --> 02:43.183
His jokes are flawless in structure and
delivery. He nails it every [bleep] time.

02:43.251 --> 02:47.955
- But Kane is dead!
- The only thing that died is your interior decorator.

02:48.022 --> 02:50.192
Geesh!

02:55.897 --> 03:01.034
What a delicious-looking cat.
Allow me to introduce it to my stomach.

03:01.102 --> 03:04.338
Here, dinner, dinner, dinner.

03:08.643 --> 03:11.178
Get away from her, you hack!

03:11.179 --> 03:14.982
Another outfit change?!
What is this ... the Oscars?

03:15.049 --> 03:18.652
- Ha! I kill me!
- No. I kill you.

03:18.653 --> 03:22.665
Hey, relax!
Ever hear of decaf?

03:23.450 --> 03:25.797
That's gonna leave a mark.

03:26.591 --> 03:28.962
Anybody got any bactine?

03:29.030 --> 03:32.788
Just shouting something
doesn't make it funny!

03:32.789 --> 03:36.637
Is this because I didn't use
a coaste-e-e-e-e-r?!

03:40.575 --> 03:43.944
Just a lizard wizard in a blizzard, yo.

03:44.012 --> 03:46.364
Nothing to see here.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.383
Muckman, you stay
here and keep April safe.

03:49.450 --> 03:55.756
- We'll go after Shredder!
- Man, Shredder and stuff. Craziness.

03:55.823 --> 03:59.960
- Yeah.
- Hey. Question. Is there a full banana peel

04:00.028 --> 04:03.228
- melting into my head right now?
- Yes.

04:03.321 --> 04:07.420
That is unfortunate.

04:09.822 --> 04:11.856
What the... who did that, man?

04:11.857 --> 04:15.890
That was probably Kraang or something.

04:15.925 --> 04:18.612
Kraang was never here. It's just us.

04:18.713 --> 04:21.498
Nah, that was probably Kraang, I bet.

04:21.499 --> 04:24.284
So nasty! That guy, man.

04:24.385 --> 04:27.487
- Uh, that's impossible. I would've seen him.
- Nah, man.

04:27.555 --> 04:30.921
Nah, he was here. He
blew ass, and then he left.

04:31.024 --> 04:33.545
Muckman, I know you're lying.

04:34.162 --> 04:35.629
Freaking Kraang, man.

04:35.630 --> 04:40.033
There is no way Kraang came
in, farted for 10 whole seconds,

04:40.101 --> 04:43.170
and then left.
I absolutely would've seen that occur.

04:43.237 --> 04:45.739
Look, I don't care! You had gas!

04:45.740 --> 04:48.241
It happens! Just please don't blatantly

04:48.309 --> 04:52.190
- lie to my face!
- Cool, man! No! Cool! Absolutely.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.314
I'm sorry. Cool.
We ... we are cool.

04:56.918 --> 04:59.774
- Kraang, man.
- It was not Kraang!!

05:02.690 --> 05:06.762
Have you seen my soap on a rope,
how did I manage to lose it?

05:06.797 --> 05:10.864
- It's on a freakin' rope! Ha!
- It's still not even a joke.

05:14.035 --> 05:16.496
I'm glad we finally admitted
we just don't work as roommates.

05:16.497 --> 05:18.804
Now people will
stop saying we're gay.

05:18.839 --> 05:21.981
Ah, this is much easier than one
of us ever getting a girlfriend.

05:22.016 --> 05:23.810
Oh, that must be the new

05:23.878 --> 05:28.248
- roommate. I found him off craigslist.
- Um, is that safe?

05:28.349 --> 05:31.797
Where can I put my spoons?

05:32.156 --> 05:35.323
Hey, Bert?  Dude, am
I waking you up, man?

05:35.358 --> 05:36.044
- Hey.
- What?!

05:36.079 --> 05:37.457
You ever put a gun in your mouth,

05:37.525 --> 05:42.462
- just to get that taste on your tongue?
- No, Sam.

05:42.563 --> 05:45.105
- Hey, Bert! Bert.
- What? What?!

05:45.106 --> 05:48.210
Do I have blood in my
mustache, Bert?

05:48.411 --> 05:52.239
Oh, is this another
harebrained scheme like Ernie?

05:52.306 --> 05:58.823
- Oh, my god! You're shitting in the sink!
- Your toilet insulted my spoons!

05:58.858 --> 06:00.847
Hey, kids!

06:00.915 --> 06:02.649
Do you have trouble tying your shoes?

06:02.650 --> 06:04.384
Well, Sam and I have a song about it!

06:04.452 --> 06:08.088
♪ Tying your shoes is so much fun ♪

06:08.156 --> 06:11.764
- # the American government planned 9/11 #
- Uh...

06:11.894 --> 06:14.528
♪ you make two loops
that look the same ♪

06:14.599 --> 06:17.230
♪ everyone knows there
was no second plane ♪

06:17.298 --> 06:19.283
Whoops! Uh-oh! My tooth fell out!

06:19.284 --> 06:21.923
Guess another angel got his wings.

06:22.158 --> 06:25.005
Hey, Bert! Just wanted to ...
Whoa! What happened?!

06:25.072 --> 06:26.913
Oh, Ernie, I tried to
make Sam the new you,

06:26.914 --> 06:29.676
but instead, he made me
the new smackhead Dave!

06:29.777 --> 06:33.113
Oh, Bert, I can cheer you up.

06:33.181 --> 06:37.006
Hey, I can do that, too.

06:37.007 --> 06:38.919
Oh, god!

06:38.986 --> 06:40.987
- Don't go!
- I must, John Connor.

06:40.988 --> 06:46.393
- To protect the future, I must be destroyed.
- Wait! Of all the abusive fathers that

06:46.460 --> 06:49.562
came and went, you
... a-a Terminator ...

06:49.563 --> 06:51.631
were the only positive influence.

06:51.699 --> 06:54.234
Stay. Be John's father.

06:54.235 --> 06:56.770
- Dad?
- Affirmative.

06:56.838 --> 07:00.240
You were supposed to pick me up from
school and take me to a Dodger game!

07:00.308 --> 07:03.009
- Oops! Forgot!
- I order you not to forget stuff!

07:03.110 --> 07:06.479
Negative. A string of neglectful
father figures gave you a strong

07:06.581 --> 07:09.573
distrust of authority. That
trait led to your role as

07:09.574 --> 07:12.566
leader of the resistance
and savior of the human race.

07:12.567 --> 07:15.388
So go get me another
beer, you piece of shit.

07:15.456 --> 07:18.124
What are you doing, idiot?

07:18.192 --> 07:23.430
Writing a short story for school.

07:23.531 --> 07:26.119
Would you like my review?

07:26.120 --> 07:27.414
This is terrible.

07:27.415 --> 07:30.003
You don't write stories again.

07:30.104 --> 07:33.707
- You suck at it.
- Don't worry! I won't!

07:36.344 --> 07:40.319
- I am drunk!
- Good for you.

07:40.354 --> 07:44.017
- Don't smoke in my house, boy!
- I can do whatever I want in my room!

07:49.290 --> 07:54.862
Now your room has no wall, so
it's technically part of my house!

07:55.930 --> 07:57.998
Hasta la vista, butt-nut!

08:00.067 --> 08:01.757
He has a point, John.

08:02.703 --> 08:05.138
If we're going to save
this ship, we'll have to tap

08:05.206 --> 08:08.684
- into the navigation computer and ...
- Winona Ryder's on this ship?!

08:08.743 --> 08:12.829
Lock my trailer!
My iPod's in there! Ha!

08:15.383 --> 08:19.097
I don't usually get involve
in day-to-day operations,

08:19.098 --> 08:20.954
so I'm smurfing undercover.

08:21.022 --> 08:25.191
They'll never smurf it's me.
Ohh, I haven't smurf these

08:25.259 --> 08:28.795
things off in nearly 300 years!
Talk about crotch rot!

08:31.632 --> 08:35.350
- So, you're my new intern, huh?
- That's right, farmer Smurf.

08:35.386 --> 08:38.539
Teach me to care about
your sadly little life ...

08:38.541 --> 08:40.643
I mean your noble and fulfilling, uh,

08:40.710 --> 08:43.644
- career choice.
- Well, Smurfs are a thirsty bunch,

08:43.775 --> 08:46.782
so we got to smurf them
fresh milk every day!

08:49.486 --> 08:52.071
We've been drinking caterpillar milk?!

08:53.120 --> 08:54.657
Oh, this is agony.

08:54.724 --> 08:58.794
- It feels like my hands are gonna smurf off!
- Yep, my carpal tunnel got so bad,

08:58.862 --> 09:03.947
- they had to fuse my wrist bones in place!
- But our healthcare is smurfy, right?

09:03.982 --> 09:07.732
- Eh, my deductible is 2,000 smurfberries.
- What?!

09:09.863 --> 09:12.865
Dr. Smurf, why are
deductibles so high?

09:12.900 --> 09:16.090
Boy, you smurf a lot of uppity questions
for an intern. Uh, just treat the

09:16.091 --> 09:19.281
next patient while I go for a jamba-juice
run in my gold-plated helicopter.

09:19.349 --> 09:22.436
- Zoom, zoom.
- Actually, I'm not really qualified. I ...

09:22.954 --> 09:25.821
We need Dr. Smurf!

09:25.889 --> 09:28.757
- Handy had an accident!
- Did someone get a sliver?

09:28.758 --> 09:31.489
- Oh, my smurfing god!
- I sawed right through

09:31.524 --> 09:33.829
a load-bearing mushroom!
Half our building materials

09:33.897 --> 09:36.765
are fungus! Oh, trade school
didn't prepare me for this!

09:36.833 --> 09:40.769
- You can smurf his fingers, right, nurse?
- I'll certainly try.

09:40.837 --> 09:44.740
- I'll certainly tried.
- You can probably stop sewing.

09:44.808 --> 09:48.043
No, no, no. I-I'm gonna get this.
So, grouchy Smurf,

09:48.111 --> 09:50.446
- how's the coffee today?
- I hate coffee!

09:50.514 --> 09:53.349
- Oh! Okay. But how do you like working here?
- I hate working here.

09:53.416 --> 09:54.350
Oh, goodness. Okay.

09:54.351 --> 09:57.153
Well, is there anything that
maybe Papa Smurf could do?

09:57.220 --> 10:00.656
- I hate Papa Smurf!
- All right, what exactly do you do around here?

10:00.724 --> 10:05.694
- I-I... hate stuff?
- I'm being deadly serious.

10:05.762 --> 10:07.826
I... I...

10:10.208 --> 10:12.394
I hate shoveling dog shit.

10:12.429 --> 10:14.637
Well, now that's actually
an appropriate reaction.

10:14.638 --> 10:17.452
Carry on, dog-shit Smurf!
