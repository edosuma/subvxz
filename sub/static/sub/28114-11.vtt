00:13.926 --> 00:15.450
Spirit.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.026
Spirit.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.310
Come on!

00:29.311 --> 00:30.465
Off you go!

00:33.141 --> 00:35.403
Spirit. Spirit.

00:35.404 --> 00:37.144
All clear, girls!

00:37.145 --> 00:39.146
- All gone.
- We did it, Grams!

00:39.147 --> 00:40.321
Thanks, Nana!

00:46.256 --> 00:48.013
It is definitely active in here.

00:48.014 --> 00:49.233
Active, like good, or...?

00:49.234 --> 00:51.463
Is there something evil in the house?

00:51.464 --> 00:54.205
Oh, no. Not evil. If there
was evil here, I'd throw up.

00:54.206 --> 00:57.338
- Oh, God. Please don't do that.
- No, I'm-I'm feeling kindness

00:57.339 --> 00:58.731
and decency...

00:58.732 --> 01:01.342
and love.

01:01.343 --> 01:03.127
And a pig.

01:03.128 --> 01:04.432
A pig?

01:04.433 --> 01:06.869
I gained, like, ten pounds in college.

01:06.870 --> 01:09.524
- Is-is that weird?
- No, no, not... No.

01:09.525 --> 01:10.699
No.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.528
This has nothing to do
with food or weight. Um,

01:13.529 --> 01:15.292
has there been a pig in anyone's life?

01:16.728 --> 01:20.492
Actually, last week when I
was getting my roots done,

01:20.493 --> 01:23.929
one of the colorists at
the salon had a baby pig.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.662
Oh, my God, no fair!

01:25.663 --> 01:26.899
Interesting.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.263
Although, there is something
piglike about a salon.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.553
Well, you know, um,

01:31.554 --> 01:33.983
snouts in the trough of privilege and...

01:33.984 --> 01:36.377
the troughs are all the-the hair dryers,

01:36.378 --> 01:39.163
and the... pig grunts are
all the bits of gossips.

01:39.164 --> 01:42.557
This one, wow.

01:42.558 --> 01:44.907
- Yeah, I know.
- She should be listened to.

01:44.908 --> 01:46.953
Like I have a choice?

01:46.954 --> 01:49.390
Clearly, you're a sharp kid, Frankie.

01:49.391 --> 01:51.175
Well, thank you.

01:51.176 --> 01:54.395
But, you know, that sharpness...
it can hurt people.

01:54.396 --> 01:57.355
Oh, w... No, I-I know.

01:57.356 --> 01:59.357
But I'm-I'm... not like that.

01:59.358 --> 02:00.978
I'm-I'm pretty chill.

02:04.211 --> 02:07.930
Look, all I'm saying is just...
just bring it down a notch.

02:07.931 --> 02:10.933
Especially with the people you love.

02:10.934 --> 02:12.784
Like your mom.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.373
Okay.

02:15.374 --> 02:17.418
I'm getting another feeling.

02:17.419 --> 02:19.246
Another animal. Not a pig.

02:19.247 --> 02:21.292
Something smaller. A bird?

02:21.293 --> 02:23.294
Or... or a mouse.

02:23.295 --> 02:25.339
Mandy Patinkin!

02:25.340 --> 02:28.386
My mouse... she died, and my
momflushed her down the toilet.

02:28.387 --> 02:29.865
Oh. Okay.

02:29.866 --> 02:32.041
Well, Mandy Patinkin misses you.

02:32.042 --> 02:33.434
A lot.

02:33.435 --> 02:36.568
I can feel her here, right now.

02:36.569 --> 02:39.353
She's... she's watching over you.

02:39.354 --> 02:41.268
She's your guardian angel.

02:41.269 --> 02:43.314
Thank you, Mandy Patinkin.

02:43.315 --> 02:44.924
I miss you.

02:44.925 --> 02:47.013
Anyone home?

02:47.014 --> 02:48.362
Oh.

02:48.363 --> 02:51.171
Well. What's going on here?

02:52.868 --> 02:54.455
Is this...

02:54.456 --> 02:58.372
Oh. Is this the gypsy you
hired to read palms?

02:58.373 --> 03:00.658
Why is he dressed normal?

03:01.616 --> 03:03.203
Hello.

03:03.204 --> 03:04.987
I'm Phyllis.

03:04.988 --> 03:06.293
Toby D'Angelo.

03:06.294 --> 03:09.775
Oh! Don't ever grab

03:09.776 --> 03:11.472
a lady's hand like that.

03:11.473 --> 03:13.257
I... I beg your pardon.

03:13.258 --> 03:15.124
I'm-I'm so sorry.

03:15.125 --> 03:16.831
Okay, um...

03:16.832 --> 03:18.349
Allow me to be frank.

03:18.350 --> 03:22.091
I have my own feelings
about hexes and spells,

03:22.092 --> 03:23.745
as far as men are concerned.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.791
But I'm willing to be entertained.

03:25.792 --> 03:27.096
Here's my palm.

03:27.097 --> 03:28.533
Oh. Uh, n-no.

03:28.534 --> 03:30.056
I don't-I don't read palms.

03:30.057 --> 03:31.623
- Uh...
- And, "gypsy"...

03:31.624 --> 03:33.320
It's quite an archaic term.

03:33.321 --> 03:36.018
And frankly, it's offensive to mediums.

03:36.019 --> 03:38.282
Phil.

03:38.283 --> 03:39.892
We're in the middle of something.

03:39.893 --> 03:41.502
Yes. Go on.

03:41.503 --> 03:44.297
I'll just sit and watch.

03:44.298 --> 03:46.230
Don't you have somewhere you need to be?

03:46.231 --> 03:48.596
No. Not at all.

03:48.597 --> 03:51.579
I couldn't help but notice thatthis
house is filled with women.

03:51.580 --> 03:54.341
Oh, yes. Flooding with estrogen.

03:54.342 --> 03:56.387
Wall-to-wall vaginas.

03:56.388 --> 03:59.390
It's like a matriarchal dystopia.

03:59.391 --> 04:01.162
Especially...

04:01.163 --> 04:03.343
as it's well-known that half the women

04:03.344 --> 04:05.886
in my side of the family are witches.

04:05.887 --> 04:06.898
Phil.

04:06.899 --> 04:09.138
Okay. All right.

04:09.139 --> 04:11.402
Not a word. God forbid.

04:11.403 --> 04:13.447
Even though, uh,

04:13.448 --> 04:16.624
this house is filled
with feminine... energy,

04:16.625 --> 04:19.850
I'm feeling a masculine presence.

04:19.851 --> 04:21.903
His energy is everywhere.

04:21.904 --> 04:25.329
Oh, please. You don't have
to bea psychic for that.

04:25.330 --> 04:28.248
What you're sensing, Mr. D'Angelo,

04:28.249 --> 04:32.359
is the deadbeat father,
Sam's ex-husband.

04:33.557 --> 04:35.282
So your dad...

04:35.623 --> 04:37.166
is not really in the picture?

04:37.167 --> 04:38.974
No, not at all.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.519
You girls mind if I
give you some advice?

04:41.520 --> 04:44.545
Something... I wish I would
have known when I was young.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.655
If you have a toxic person in your life,

04:48.656 --> 04:51.311
you need to move past him, or her,

04:51.312 --> 04:53.661
and protect yourselves.

04:53.662 --> 04:56.370
How do you move past a dad?

04:56.371 --> 04:59.459
- It's my dad.
- Don't think of him that way.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.626
Think of him as a friend,

05:01.627 --> 05:03.513
someone who let you down.

05:04.660 --> 05:06.293
What do you do with a friend like that?

05:08.258 --> 05:09.520
You move on.

05:12.021 --> 05:15.135
But the man I'm sensing is not your dad.

05:15.136 --> 05:18.359
Someone older. Someone you love.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.394
Older? Who?

05:20.395 --> 05:22.386
I'm seeing a big collar, beard,

05:22.387 --> 05:25.589
bushy eyebrows, a large laugh.

05:25.590 --> 05:28.130
Someone who's been gone quite a while.

05:28.131 --> 05:30.206
Grandpa!

05:30.207 --> 05:31.699
It's Grandpa. It has to be.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.970
Wow.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.206
Hmm.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.216
Sorry.

05:48.013 --> 05:50.163
So, how long have you been doing this?

05:50.164 --> 05:52.329
Since I was about 15.

05:56.508 --> 05:58.596
- And you call it a gift?
- A gift, yeah.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.826
Hi!

06:11.827 --> 06:14.438
There's my babies.

06:14.439 --> 06:16.483
He's a good boy. He's a good boy.

06:34.407 --> 06:37.344
On the stairs. In plain sight.

06:37.345 --> 06:40.434
In a house with a 14-year-old

06:40.435 --> 06:41.957
and an 11-year-old.

06:41.958 --> 06:45.521
Seriously. Guys, this is still hot.

06:45.522 --> 06:47.397
Mom!

06:47.398 --> 06:50.380
You can't scold us.
We're not kids anymore.

06:52.251 --> 06:53.992
Go away!

06:54.857 --> 06:56.276
Wow.

06:56.277 --> 06:57.712
She's still here.

06:59.976 --> 07:01.739
Oh, my God, that's... Oh...

07:03.654 --> 07:05.285
Jesus, Mom.

07:05.286 --> 07:06.926
Stop.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.793
Can't you see we're talking?

07:08.794 --> 07:10.028
No, Max.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.161
You stop!

07:12.162 --> 07:13.597
Okay.

07:13.598 --> 07:15.382
Okay.

07:15.383 --> 07:17.775
And, you, John-O,

07:17.776 --> 07:20.815
I helped you come outto your
parents, remember that?

07:21.745 --> 07:23.046
And Amir...

07:23.047 --> 07:27.307
Amir, you ask me for money
every time I see you,

07:27.308 --> 07:30.074
and I give it to you, and
I can't help but notice

07:30.075 --> 07:32.171
that you're wearing $300 Yeezys.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.619
And you?

07:35.620 --> 07:38.492
I don't even know who the hell you are.

07:38.493 --> 07:42.214
And, Paisley, honey, come here.

07:43.259 --> 07:45.455
I practically raised you,

07:45.456 --> 07:48.241
and do you know how many
parent wars and boyfriend wars

07:48.242 --> 07:51.244
and morning-after pills that
I have walked you through?

07:51.245 --> 07:53.443
And you treat me this way?

07:56.467 --> 07:57.859
Yes.

07:57.860 --> 07:59.515
Yeesh.

07:59.516 --> 08:00.992
I'm too high for this.

08:00.993 --> 08:02.516
I'm sorry, Sam.

08:02.517 --> 08:04.082
Um...

08:04.083 --> 08:06.694
look, I... I'm really sorry.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.479
I-I don't know you, and you seem nice.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.221
And... I just came over with Paisley.

08:12.222 --> 08:14.599
A-And, you know, Max was being nice.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.573
And you all seem... nice.

08:16.574 --> 08:18.619
You... I...

08:18.620 --> 08:21.187
Uh, I'll stop. Yeah.

08:21.188 --> 08:23.111
I'm sorry, Sam.

08:23.112 --> 08:24.381
It was my pipe.

08:24.382 --> 08:26.322
I totally admit it. My bad.

08:26.323 --> 08:28.628
Not anymore. It's mine now.

08:31.747 --> 08:35.063
Clean this up, move out.

08:35.065 --> 08:37.289
Don't bring this shit to my house.

08:37.291 --> 08:39.315
Come on!

08:41.904 --> 08:43.760
I'm so sorry.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.820
- I'll get you another pipe.
- It's cool, Max.

08:45.821 --> 08:47.478
I got plenty of those pipes
at home, so we're good.

08:47.479 --> 08:48.861
No. I'm sorry, guys.

08:52.039 --> 08:53.915
Diaper, lose the gum.

08:53.916 --> 08:55.569
The doctor said I have anxiety,

08:55.570 --> 08:57.484
and if I don't chew gum, I could die.

08:57.485 --> 08:59.137
Okay, well, that's nonsense.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.510
Well, I-I have a note.

09:03.556 --> 09:04.795
Mm, I-I... I can't find it.

09:04.796 --> 09:06.355
You know what?

09:06.356 --> 09:08.545
Never mind. Just keep it in your mouth.

09:08.546 --> 09:10.056
Okay.

09:14.524 --> 09:15.676
What are you doing here?

09:15.677 --> 09:17.884
Oh, I'm... I'm chaperoning.

09:17.885 --> 09:19.485
I came to chaperone.

09:21.911 --> 09:23.553
Whatever, Samuel.

09:23.554 --> 09:25.274
So transparent.

09:33.051 --> 09:34.714
Frankie's adjusting well.

09:34.715 --> 09:36.087
Yeah, you think?

09:36.088 --> 09:37.872
It's a tricky age to skip.

09:37.873 --> 09:39.265
Starting high school early.

09:39.266 --> 09:40.742
How's she handling the workload?

09:40.743 --> 09:42.703
Uh, it's pretty good, I guess.

09:42.704 --> 09:45.314
I-I thought it was gonna
tire her out, but...

09:45.315 --> 09:47.621
The geniuses are always
a pain in the ass.

09:47.622 --> 09:50.276
That one sleeps out.

09:50.277 --> 09:51.494
No texts, no calls.

09:51.495 --> 09:54.433
I mean, when did that become okay?

10:06.402 --> 10:08.424
Los Angeles, make some noise!

10:10.775 --> 10:13.908
And then keep that round of applause

10:13.909 --> 10:18.652
going for my DJ, DJ Teazz Yung.

10:18.653 --> 10:20.393
Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

10:20.394 --> 10:22.351
Now look, y'all, we getting into it,

10:22.352 --> 10:24.527
so I'm gonna get my butt offstage,

10:24.528 --> 10:27.617
but I am hyped to introduce this
next young person to the stage.

10:27.618 --> 10:29.619
Give it up for Yoko Tamada!

10:31.448 --> 10:33.342
Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

10:35.213 --> 10:37.888
I'm Yoko Tamada.

10:37.889 --> 10:40.935
I'm from CB-Watts, and this
is "To Be or Not to Be."

10:40.936 --> 10:42.023
I want to know

10:42.024 --> 10:45.505
that my poems are proof of my progress.

10:45.506 --> 10:47.376
To be sin.

10:47.377 --> 10:50.292
Satan, biblical turmoil.

10:50.293 --> 10:52.555
To be fine.

10:52.556 --> 10:56.124
To be fine. Fine.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.821
I'm not fine.

10:57.822 --> 11:00.911
But I'm learning how to
turn sins into poems.

11:00.912 --> 11:03.523
To be the last word.

11:03.524 --> 11:04.872
To be... psych.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.788
I don't end my poems that way.

11:07.789 --> 11:11.531
That morning, I saw the stars
float out of my dreams

11:11.532 --> 11:13.533
and land in the chest.

11:13.534 --> 11:16.579
I said,"This hand is made for someone,

11:16.580 --> 11:18.668
and in yours it feels the best."

11:18.669 --> 11:20.670
The city smiled with us.

11:20.671 --> 11:23.064
Car horns played a melodic parade.

11:23.065 --> 11:24.805
We danced and we played

11:24.806 --> 11:29.505
till a man twice my age,
skin the same, dared to say,

11:29.506 --> 11:31.551
"Oh!

11:31.552 --> 11:35.076
"You got yourself a blackbitch?

11:35.077 --> 11:38.601
"Damn, you deserve an Oscar!

11:38.602 --> 11:41.410
I'm gonna give you an award."

11:45.762 --> 11:47.915
The next time I walked past him,

11:47.916 --> 11:51.222
I couldn't hold my partner's hand.

11:51.223 --> 11:53.616
I wanted to make sure
I could flip him off

11:53.617 --> 11:55.226
with bothhands this time.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.674
Yo, we're on in, like, 20.

12:07.675 --> 12:09.327
Toboosi wants to run it again.

12:09.328 --> 12:10.439
Just do it without me.

12:17.054 --> 12:18.728
I'm sorry. I...

12:18.729 --> 12:20.449
It's fine.

12:21.754 --> 12:23.733
You should go.

12:23.734 --> 12:25.454
No, I'm good right here, thanks.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.786
Sweet Moon, I thank thee
for thy sunny beams.

12:32.787 --> 12:34.918
I thank thee, Moon, for
shining now so bright.

12:34.919 --> 12:37.747
For, by thy gracious,
golden, glittering gleams,

12:37.748 --> 12:39.662
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.

12:39.663 --> 12:40.837
But stay, O spite!

12:40.838 --> 12:42.360
But mark, poor knight.

12:42.361 --> 12:44.014
What dreadful dole is here!

12:44.015 --> 12:45.755
I thought... I thought we
were doing Romeo and Juliet.

12:45.756 --> 12:47.583
Oh, I'm so sorry. Geez.

12:47.584 --> 12:50.064
Asian girls love hip-hop
like a white man loves golf.

12:50.065 --> 12:52.370
Asian girls love hip-hop

12:52.371 --> 12:55.156
like white women love juice
cleanses and spin classes.

12:56.201 --> 12:57.767
Asian girls love hip-hop.

12:59.248 --> 13:02.119
And it's about time hip-hop
started to love us back.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.780
Sorry.

13:10.781 --> 13:13.043
I think I'm feeling a little better.

13:13.044 --> 13:14.784
Are you sure?

13:14.785 --> 13:18.289
'Cause I don't care. We
don't have to do this.

13:24.817 --> 13:27.188
Does my face look weird?

13:27.189 --> 13:29.669
No weirder than it normally does.

13:29.670 --> 13:30.757
Audience, make sure

13:30.758 --> 13:32.541
you're showing lots of
love. Matter of fact,

13:32.542 --> 13:34.456
can we do a little drumroll
real quick on your thigh?

13:34.457 --> 13:36.850
Coming up to the stage,

13:36.851 --> 13:39.330
representing Hamilton High School,

13:39.331 --> 13:42.769
y'all give it up for Bryce Banks!

13:44.815 --> 13:46.860
Ebonics.

13:46.861 --> 13:48.688
Hooked on Phonics. Better to speak right

13:48.689 --> 13:50.559
than be addicted to the chronic.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.865
Yeah, the streets, we bonded.

13:51.866 --> 13:53.867
Heavily influenced by
Glock alarm clocks,

13:53.868 --> 13:56.826
but you hear us speak and
think we call Beverly home.

13:56.827 --> 14:00.351
Home. Streets we grew up on
flooded with demonic tongues.

14:00.352 --> 14:02.223
Guns, usually shunned
if you sound like me.

14:02.224 --> 14:03.964
Black boy, but not.

14:03.965 --> 14:05.531
Too wise to let my teeth
fall and my tongue rot.

14:05.532 --> 14:06.706
I remember snot-nosed me.

14:06.707 --> 14:08.838
Too critical to speak the language.

14:08.839 --> 14:10.361
Brain, rearranged, told me,
"A'ight" wasn't a word,

14:10.362 --> 14:11.841
or "all right" sounded more my style.

14:11.842 --> 14:13.364
Learned, earned that "A" in grammar,

14:13.365 --> 14:15.889
but hammered the nail of
life precisely in my coffin.

14:15.890 --> 14:17.151
"No, you're not black.

14:17.152 --> 14:18.674
"You ain't a nigga.

14:18.675 --> 14:19.980
Listen to the way you be talking."

14:19.981 --> 14:21.547
Learning well too early

14:21.548 --> 14:22.809
that my culture was
defined by ignorance.

14:22.810 --> 14:24.375
That if you didn't punctuate sentences

14:24.376 --> 14:25.899
with "nigga," you wasn't one.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.857
But too weak to hold a gun,
get scared, can't fight.

14:27.858 --> 14:29.685
Have no defense, just run.

14:29.686 --> 14:32.601
I learned to speak in a
way that would save me.

14:32.602 --> 14:33.950
Go in, poet!

14:33.951 --> 14:35.473
I use analogies and
metaphors to guide me.

14:35.474 --> 14:37.171
Anecdotes and white humor to shield me,

14:37.172 --> 14:38.999
'cause one wrong conjunction, and
that could be the end of me.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.566
Yes, I open my mouth,

14:40.567 --> 14:41.784
and words seem to flow out seamlessly.

14:41.785 --> 14:43.351
But, really, it's just a ruse.

14:43.352 --> 14:45.048
The two tongues I use
should be on pay-per-view.

14:45.049 --> 14:46.984
The inner battle between
culture and safety rages on.

14:46.985 --> 14:48.704
If you look closely, you can see

14:48.705 --> 14:50.576
political correctness
throw the first punch.

14:50.577 --> 14:52.283
Sometimes I wish for a moment

14:52.284 --> 14:54.014
where I could speak the way I want to.

14:54.015 --> 14:57.408
Where words don't carry races
on their backs like legacies.

14:57.409 --> 15:00.724
A sentence that was just me.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.430
Would that be a'ight?

15:02.431 --> 15:03.893
Thank you.

15:09.530 --> 15:11.466
Now, when I say "spoken,"
y'all say "word."

15:11.467 --> 15:12.467
- Spoken!
- Word!

15:12.468 --> 15:13.947
- Spoken!
- Word!

15:21.961 --> 15:24.479
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.873
It's something else, isn't it?

15:26.874 --> 15:28.222
Oh, yes.

15:28.223 --> 15:30.267
You have a grandchild in the program?

15:30.268 --> 15:31.965
- Yes.
- Me, too.

15:31.966 --> 15:34.707
Well, my daughter. Frankie.

15:34.708 --> 15:37.231
Oh, here. Here you go.

15:37.232 --> 15:39.363
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:39.364 --> 15:42.095
I think she wrote about her family.

15:42.096 --> 15:44.542
Maybe I should make a break for it, huh?

15:44.543 --> 15:47.415
Family is the most important.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.605
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

15:49.606 --> 15:52.132
What did your grandchild write about?

15:52.133 --> 15:55.555
My surviving grandson will
speak on the detention

15:55.556 --> 15:58.632
and physical assaults
endured by his mother

15:58.633 --> 16:02.346
at the hands of the
Communist Party of Vietnam

16:02.347 --> 16:06.477
and their state-sanctioned violence

16:06.478 --> 16:08.915
against political dissidents.

16:08.916 --> 16:09.916
Wow.

16:09.917 --> 16:11.094
Good one.

16:12.314 --> 16:13.789
No.

16:13.790 --> 16:16.009
No.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.769
What's good, everybody? If
you're feeling good, say "yeah."

16:36.770 --> 16:38.074
- Yeah!
- If you're feeling

16:38.075 --> 16:40.033
really good and you don't
care who knows about it,

16:40.034 --> 16:41.164
say "hell yeah."

16:41.165 --> 16:43.558
- Hell yeah!
- Coming up next,

16:43.559 --> 16:45.778
from Beccles Charter High School,

16:45.779 --> 16:47.867
give it up for Darby Lincoln,

16:47.868 --> 16:51.609
Toboosi Cucci, and Frankie Fox!

16:55.158 --> 16:57.137
Give it up!

16:59.140 --> 17:01.642
Yes!

17:05.342 --> 17:06.537
Uh, hi.

17:06.538 --> 17:07.843
We're from Beccles Charter High,

17:07.844 --> 17:10.038
and this is our original poem.

17:14.155 --> 17:16.394
If you don't go potty, the
wolf will come and eat you.

17:16.395 --> 17:18.166
Eat your spinach or you'll never grow.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.595
Don't listen to those bullies.
They're just jealous of you.

17:20.596 --> 17:22.077
Your father and I are splitting up,

17:22.078 --> 17:23.305
but nothing is going to change.

17:23.306 --> 17:24.436
It's okay.

17:24.438 --> 17:26.279
Everything happens for a reason.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.952
These are the little lies
we tell our little ones.

17:29.953 --> 17:31.388
These harmless little lies

17:31.389 --> 17:34.391
that make their little
lives a little easier.

17:34.392 --> 17:37.177
These little white lies.

17:37.178 --> 17:40.093
We need to talk about the
way we talk to our kids.

17:40.094 --> 17:41.442
Because there's never been a worse time

17:41.443 --> 17:43.914
to have a casual
relationship with the truth.

17:43.915 --> 17:45.576
And we know enough to ask for better,

17:45.577 --> 17:47.230
because you raised us better.

17:47.231 --> 17:50.139
When did parental control
become a setting on your iPad?

17:50.140 --> 17:52.244
You pass on to us your insecurities,

17:52.245 --> 17:54.386
your prejudices, your morality.

17:54.387 --> 17:56.266
Your weak ankles, your crooked teeth,

17:56.267 --> 17:59.068
your fear of spiders, and
your high cholesterol.

17:59.069 --> 18:00.430
Why not your truth?

18:00.431 --> 18:02.578
Why not say your truths?

18:02.579 --> 18:04.813
Give us the benefit of your experience.

18:04.814 --> 18:06.299
- While we're still asking.
- While we're still asking.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.034
If you want to protect
me from the world,

18:08.035 --> 18:09.595
then prepare me for the world.

18:09.596 --> 18:12.386
I wish I had known that
everything was going to change,

18:12.387 --> 18:14.671
that I would see my
father only once a year,

18:14.672 --> 18:17.246
that I would hear my mother
sobbing in the bathroom,

18:17.247 --> 18:18.871
trying to be strong for us.

18:18.872 --> 18:21.090
I wish I had known that
they weren't jealous,

18:21.091 --> 18:23.477
that they didn't understand what I was,

18:23.478 --> 18:25.428
that I didn't understand what I was.

18:25.429 --> 18:26.661
But it's okay,

18:26.662 --> 18:28.881
because everything happens
for a reason, right?

18:28.882 --> 18:30.230
Stop worrying about the medium.

18:30.231 --> 18:31.927
And start caring about the message.

18:31.928 --> 18:33.711
Because there's never been an easy way

18:33.712 --> 18:35.281
to tell a hard truth.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.006
Wow.

18:59.007 --> 19:01.210
Wow, you were incredible.

19:01.211 --> 19:03.872
- You were so, so good up there.
- Mom!

19:03.873 --> 19:06.179
Oh, my God. You wrote that?

19:06.180 --> 19:07.963
- Stop! Mom!
- Wow!

19:07.964 --> 19:09.660
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

19:09.661 --> 19:11.780
- But I'm so, so proud of you.
- Mom...

19:11.781 --> 19:14.100
I can't believe what you did up there.

19:14.101 --> 19:16.145
Let's go celebrate, okay?

19:16.146 --> 19:18.539
- You want a Blooming Onion?
- Yo! Franklin!

19:18.540 --> 19:19.845
- Let's go to Outback.
- Coming!

19:19.846 --> 19:21.890
Where are you going?

19:21.891 --> 19:23.892
You're not going back on the bus?

19:23.893 --> 19:25.417
Frankie!

19:32.119 --> 19:34.468
Serious?

19:34.469 --> 19:36.122
Hmm.

19:44.501 --> 19:46.001
Hello.

19:46.002 --> 19:47.873
Hey.

19:47.874 --> 19:49.985
Go on. Keep playing. It's lovely.

19:53.205 --> 19:55.489
Is that crack cocaine?

19:55.490 --> 19:57.012
No, there's no crack here.

19:57.013 --> 19:58.647
Then what, marijuana?

19:58.648 --> 19:59.671
Mm-hmm.

20:00.641 --> 20:02.446
Don't slouch, love.

20:02.447 --> 20:05.562
No one will take you seriously.

20:05.563 --> 20:08.617
A man who slouches is like a
man who carries a purse...

20:08.618 --> 20:11.822
You'll get away with it, but
everybody will judge you.

20:12.746 --> 20:13.986
May I?

20:13.987 --> 20:15.335
You want some of this?

20:15.336 --> 20:17.119
They say it's excellent for arthritis.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.729
I want to see for myself.

20:18.730 --> 20:19.992
Have you ever had it before?

20:19.993 --> 20:21.994
I most certainly have not.

20:21.995 --> 20:24.083
Do I look like some flower child to you?

20:24.084 --> 20:25.780
All right, well,

20:25.781 --> 20:27.782
just take small puffs,
'cause this kush got kick.

20:27.783 --> 20:29.653
Mm-hmm.

20:32.396 --> 20:33.850
There you go.

20:34.464 --> 20:36.356
- Gran!
- Hello, darling.

20:36.357 --> 20:38.184
John-o, what the hell do
you think you're doing,

20:38.185 --> 20:39.707
giving her that?

20:39.708 --> 20:41.364
She asked me. What was
I supposed to say, no?

20:41.365 --> 20:42.705
- Yes!
- Stop being such

20:42.706 --> 20:44.189
a stick in the mud, Max.

20:44.190 --> 20:46.583
Just stand there and keep
an eye out for your mother.

20:46.584 --> 20:48.759
Okay.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.327
- Here you go.
- It's awfully good.

20:55.789 --> 20:56.985
Nice.

20:56.986 --> 20:58.227
Mmm!

21:05.662 --> 21:07.089
Can I help you?

21:07.090 --> 21:08.601
Postmates?

21:08.602 --> 21:11.240
Oh. Oh.

21:12.502 --> 21:14.417
Well, it's not food.

21:16.810 --> 21:18.094
Hemingway?

21:18.977 --> 21:20.336
Nice.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.880
Seriously?

21:22.881 --> 21:24.317
You guys don't card?

21:24.318 --> 21:25.579
Uh, I don't know.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.782
Wow, you should know.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.802
This is not cool!

21:31.499 --> 21:33.456
It's not your fault, but you
should talk to your manager

21:33.457 --> 21:35.673
or your supervisor or something.

21:35.674 --> 21:37.054
Have a great night.

21:37.055 --> 21:38.227
Have a nice night.

21:43.293 --> 21:44.815
Hello?

21:49.898 --> 21:51.468
You're welcome!

21:52.502 --> 21:55.652
So glad you could stop by!

21:58.198 --> 22:00.328
You've been a great audience!

22:04.227 --> 22:06.576
Oh, Jesus.

22:06.577 --> 22:09.275
Good night, Detroit!
