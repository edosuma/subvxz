for you to learn to fly.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.661
I put the mattress down there
as a safety precaution,

18:01.661 --> 18:03.292
but I really need you guys
to nail this on the first try.

18:03.292 --> 18:06.796
Now fly!
Fly far away!

18:06.796 --> 18:08.377

Uh, don't worry, guys.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.558
Funcle Cricket's comin'.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.560
Ah, dang it.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.392
Hold on.
My dang overalls are stuck.

18:23.392 --> 18:25.434
Hang on,
little birds.

18:27.436 --> 18:30.229
Huh? Hey, wait.

18:30.229 --> 18:32.071
Tilly, help.
I need your help.

18:32.071 --> 18:34.443
I needn't concern myself.

18:34.443 --> 18:36.535
They have chosen
not to want me.

18:36.535 --> 18:38.447
The baby birds
are in the trash!

18:38.447 --> 18:39.949
Huh?

18:39.949 --> 18:42.371
Tilly,
do something!

18:42.371 --> 18:45.294
My babies are in trouble.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.507
Huh? My skateboard!

18:50.670 --> 18:54.013
Ah, a fellow believer

19:01.140 --> 19:02.932

yellow means floor it!

raise no turtle.

19:31.881 --> 19:33.172
That way.

We're full.
Start the compacter.

19:39.298 --> 19:40.680
Oh, the truck.

They learned
my song.
