LADY JUSTICE SPENCER:
The fire arm used

00:02.800 --> 00:06.191
in the November 29th incident
at Café 66

00:06.360 --> 00:09.194
was a Zastava M57 pistol.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.280
It was manufactured in 1991

00:12.560 --> 00:16.349
at the Zastava arms facility
in the former republic of Yugoslavia.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.158
It's path into the shooter's hands
remains unknown.

LADY JUSTICE: The gun was
recovered by police at the scene.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.316
Between 9:21 and 10:33am

01:47.400 --> 01:49.596
on the morning of November 29th

01:50.040 --> 01:53.477
the M57 was fired nine times.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.757

- Can I order a gin and tonic, please?

03:13.040 --> 03:14.679
Your GPS broke?

03:15.040 --> 03:16.599
Don't get many southerners up here.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.320
Oh, no, I was just passing through.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.915
A friend suggested I stop in.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Two pound.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.114
Wow, a drink's a fiver in my local.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.199
Definitely not in the South
anymore.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.400
Well, further up you get,
the further your money goes.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.120
I heard, drinks are free
in the North Pole.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.240
Have we met somewhere before?
You seem dead familiar.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.830
I don't think so.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.715
JIM SINGS TUNELESSLY

03:41.800 --> 03:44.599
Who's your friend, sweetheart?
I'll have to buy her a drink.

03:44.880 --> 03:45.880
Oh, it's a him.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.477
Charlie. Charlie Goodman.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.076
Do you remember him?

03:51.800 --> 03:54.395
Yeah, there was a Charlie
who used to come in here, years back.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.399
Lives in the States now, I hear.

03:56.800 --> 03:57.800
America?

03:58.400 --> 03:59.470
Where abouts?

04:01.240 --> 04:04.199
Well, if you were a friend of his
you'd know that wouldn't you sweetheart?

04:07.880 --> 04:10.076
HOLLY: It was a priest who found Nigel.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.110
Did you know that?

04:13.040 --> 04:15.509
Most addicts die where they shoot up.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.278
I suppose there's less motivation
to move

04:18.920 --> 04:22.391
but Nigel was found on the steps
of a church, two miles from his bed.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.799
Now what's this got to do with owt?

04:24.840 --> 04:26.433
Nigel was clean for seven years

04:27.560 --> 04:30.314
sees Charlie and he dies of an overdose
the same week.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.640
What Nigel was looking for

04:33.720 --> 04:35.552
when he dragged himself
up those church steps

04:36.080 --> 04:37.150
we'll never know.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.629
Maybe redemption.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.275
Maybe protection.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.078
But either way,
we know who put him there.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.200
SHARON:
I think maybe, you should leave.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.911
Sharon, when did you last see Charlie?

04:53.480 --> 04:55.278

All I can you is what he told me

"I'm not your friend."

we've identified a prime suspect.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.680
If we could just gather round.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.070
GABE: Right, "Big Shot".

06:53.720 --> 06:56.315
Sal carried that name in the ring
for 43 fights.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.235
His radicalisation most likely
took place

06:59.320 --> 07:01.118
during his brief prison stretch.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.194
His history with El Adoua.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.756
<i>Deutscher Boxsport Verband</i> website

07:05.800 --> 07:08.872
shows an eight-month gap
in Sal's fighting record.

07:09.280 --> 07:13.240
Conveniently this overlaps with
El Adoua's alleged <i>hijrah</i> to Syria.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.520
Holly.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.559
In both the Turin and Rotterdam
attack cells, El Adoua relied on

07:18.640 --> 07:21.235
local contacts to introduce him
to his new recruits.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.878
Mr Brahimi is most likely using his gym
as a cover for grooming.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.152
ROSE: Full surveillance, financials, come.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.353

07:34.640 --> 07:36.074
ROSE: Until we know the location

07:36.160 --> 07:37.514
and extent of the attack cell

07:37.760 --> 07:39.638
assume any sign of police activity

07:39.720 --> 07:42.189
could accelerate or even trigger
an early attack.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.590
We need to run background
checks on all gym members.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.879
Can we get access
to his client list?

07:47.960 --> 07:50.839
My source tells me,
he keeps his membership files on site.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.996

a UC introduction?

07:54.080 --> 07:54.957
Not a problem.

Very good, take it over to Faisal.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.910
You know my brother's
still convinced I got diddled?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.240
That wasn't my intention.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.789
Well, what was it?

08:42.960 --> 08:44.376
Your intention.
I think we're done here.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.736
You know, when you came
into my house

08:45.760 --> 08:47.479
told my mum I got child molested.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.273
DC Morton go home.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.834
What, I'll go back...
GABE: Go home!

08:51.320 --> 08:53.391
You're interfering with my operation!

08:53.960 --> 08:54.996
That's an order!

09:08.160 --> 09:09.992
How much was the signing-on fee?
Fifty?

09:10.720 --> 09:12.552
I don't want her around. Noted.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.040
Fifty was it?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
Yeah, fifty.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.640
GABE: There you go.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.395
Then there's the waiver form.
What info do they need?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.437
RAZA: Address, number,
emergency contact, that kind of thing.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.992
He'll make him sign it, then he'll put it
in the binder with everyone else's.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.999
You wanna know who goes to that gym?
It's probably in that red binder.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.673
RAZA SNIFFS - GABE: Right.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.433
Well, introduce Faisal around.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.314
Make sure he meets the Big Shot.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.116
Big Shot gives him the forms,
Faisal signs up.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.640

09:58.360 --> 09:59.555
Make them like him.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.080
Then your mum will get her passport.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.116

10:10.000 --> 10:11.116

10:11.400 --> 10:13.039

10:13.360 --> 10:14.635
It's what he needed to hear.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.594

10:58.960 --> 11:00.656

11:18.560 --> 11:20.631
Man, he's been mugged three times
already this year.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.832
He's got like a target on his back
or something.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.839
Listen, it took me a whole week

11:24.880 --> 11:26.576
just to convince him to get down here.
Look...

11:26.600 --> 11:28.720

he's always by himself.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.160
What's that tell you about him?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.240
That he could do with a friend!

11:32.800 --> 11:33.995
You'd really be helping him.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.157
You vouch for him, yeah?
Absolutely.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.391

You've been in my house plenty.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.110
Skittles and all them, I get.
But why me?

28:02.120 --> 28:04.760
Part of my job was to blend in
with people's lives.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.239
Relationships are a part of life.

28:08.280 --> 28:12.194

Your head were on my lap,
you were crying.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.835
What was it for?

28:48.880 --> 28:50.553
It was just to make you believe it.

You didn't love me...

29:09.680 --> 29:10.796

29:30.560 --> 29:31.880
That can still change.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.914
No one can know about me.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.513

31:16.160 --> 31:17.736
What about when

31:17.760 --> 31:19.035
Has it got all of his apps?

31:19.120 --> 31:21.191
COOPER:
We can't replicate his exact system set up.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.600
But when he turns it on...

31:23.360 --> 31:24.999
he gets and error message.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.720
We'll swap his phone back
when he takes the dummy in for repairs.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.456
Do you know where the real one is?

31:29.480 --> 31:30.834
Yeah, desk. Top drawer.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.196
What if it's in his pocket?

31:32.280 --> 31:33.794
Well, then I improvise, dear.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.992
Unless you'd rather wait
for the attack cell to say "hi".

31:38.920 --> 31:41.515
No? So I'll be making the swap
tonight then.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.160
HOLLY ON COM:
<i>Camera's actually there for your benefit.</i>

41:24.720 --> 41:27.918
We believe you're aware of
an imminent threat to public safety.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.434
If you provide us with any information
that prevents a loss of life

41:31.520 --> 41:32.715
or a terrorist attack

41:32.920 --> 41:34.991
we can present this interview
to the judge

41:35.120 --> 41:37.476
who's authorised to impose
a reduction on your sentencing.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.678
OK, and is it also for my benefit
that my solicitor ain't here yet?

41:40.920 --> 41:42.274
Where's the attack cell?

41:43.320 --> 41:44.549
Who even makes you lot

41:44.640 --> 41:46.921
come try chat to me,
the moment after I kill one of yours?

41:48.640 --> 41:49.676
It's gotta be rough, man.

41:49.760 --> 41:52.080
HOLLY: Are you admitting
to the murder of a police officer?

41:52.560 --> 41:53.596
I did what I did.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.554
You understand the murder of an officer
carries a whole life sentence?

41:56.680 --> 41:59.720
You saw what I did to your boy, how much
do you think I care about this life?

42:00.400 --> 42:02.232
We don't know what you care about, Sal.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.016
GABE: We don't know why
you killed Faisal

42:05.040 --> 42:06.633
why you thought
his death was necessary

42:06.720 --> 42:08.632
or what you hoped to achieve
by causing it.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.800
Only you know that.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.240
If you're willing, you'll tell us,
if you're not, you won't.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.595
We can't force you.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.280
We don't want to force you.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.678
All we want to do is save lives.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.120
We're not taking notes,
not writing down any questions.

42:23.520 --> 42:25.751
Where's the attack cell?
That's all we want to know.

42:25.840 --> 42:28.400
SAL: That cop died,
because this is a war.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.039
People die in wars.
That's just the truth.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.276
But I don't think you want
more people to die.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.200
SAL: Oh, so now
you think you know what I want?

42:37.360 --> 42:39.431
No, but I know pretending
when I see it.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.437
You came back home,
set up your gym.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.354
That's a smart move.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.153
But we've been through your files, Sal.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.709
Plenty of angry, young men
coming through your doors.

42:52.160 --> 42:53.816
A lot of them were headed down
the wrong road

42:53.840 --> 42:55.200
before they stepped into your gym.

42:55.640 --> 42:56.915
Eh?

42:57.320 --> 42:58.390
They cleaned up.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.954
Plenty of them went to uni.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.190
They're working.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.835
No scrapes with the law.

43:04.600 --> 43:05.875
That's no accident.

43:06.000 --> 43:06.877
You did that.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.880
They're good kids,
I'm not gonna argue with you.

43:11.840 --> 43:14.230
At some point the lie
became real didn't it?

43:16.200 --> 43:17.520
When did you change your mission?

43:18.200 --> 43:20.476
My mission is to serve.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.310
That don't ever change.

43:23.360 --> 43:24.714
Where's the attack cell?

43:25.880 --> 43:27.519
GABE: Sal, look at me.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.040
The people that are gonna die here,
they're not soldiers.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.878
They're not on some battle field.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.714
They're no different than the kids
whose lives you changed.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.073
ROSE: 17 Chessington Close.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.237
Let's get a head count on
the nearby properties.

43:50.440 --> 43:53.672
Find out how many civilians
are in the potential blast radius.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.600
Twenty-four hour surveillance.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.110
We can't risk a detonation
in a residential area.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.677
And the DAC won't let us go in
without confirmation of a device.

44:02.080 --> 44:03.080
In the meantime...

44:03.200 --> 44:04.680
heat signatures, layout

44:04.800 --> 44:06.996

44:23.800 --> 44:25.632

Another white van for your collection.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.194
This one's a rental.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.280
COOPER: Head's up.

44:30.440 --> 44:32.591
Didn't we flag these two
from south client roster?

44:32.680 --> 44:33.750
HOLLY: Yeah.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.678
That's Farook Syeed

44:35.720 --> 44:36.995
Zakir Ravia.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.233
WORRELL:
Let's have tail teams on standby

44:41.440 --> 44:42.840

How d'you know?

45:01.520 --> 45:02.874
Faisal, who tipped you off?

45:04.440 --> 45:05.440
No one.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.475
Then how'd you figure him out?

45:10.960 --> 45:13.031
The fool let me fix the wrong leg.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.233
You get lost in the desert,
you end up walking in circles, innit?

What are you doing out here?

46:43.480 --> 46:44.516
Believe me...

46:44.840 --> 46:47.320
Anything is better than being
at home with your <i>Ammi</i> right now.

46:47.640 --> 46:48.676
Is she alright?

46:48.880 --> 46:50.314
HANIF LAUGHS Is she alright?

46:50.840 --> 46:51.876
No, Raza!

46:52.240 --> 46:53.469
Nobody's alright.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.240
Look...

46:55.840 --> 46:57.115
What you do outside the house

46:57.560 --> 46:58.560
that's your own business.

46:58.760 --> 47:01.116
But when he comes
kicking my door down at 4am...

47:02.040 --> 47:03.156
enough is enough.

47:03.960 --> 47:05.679
You gotta tell me what's going on, Raza.

Only other <i>desi</i> in Kingston,

47:25.840 --> 47:27.035
That's when we moved in.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.920
We moved into hers?

47:30.440 --> 47:31.794
I thought she moved into ours.

47:32.760 --> 47:33.760
Nah...

47:34.400 --> 47:36.119
Your mum had taken a bad turn.

47:36.840 --> 47:38.194
I was between things...

47:38.880 --> 47:40.314
We had to down-size.

47:41.040 --> 47:42.520
It was only supposed to be temporary.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.115
RAZA: And that's when Mum died.

47:46.240 --> 47:47.240
HANIF: Yeah.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.199
And your <i>Ammi</i> never graduated.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.316
Lost her visa.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.440
Gave it up for you and your brother.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.760
That's why you've gotta tell her.

47:57.920 --> 47:58.920
I can't.

47:59.880 --> 48:00.880
Raza, love...

48:01.440 --> 48:03.557
You and Nas are always gonna be her boys.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.199
That's not gonna change
no matter what.

Some of the people I deal with...

48:11.400 --> 48:12.800
if they ever found out...

48:13.640 --> 48:14.835
what I've been doing...

48:18.720 --> 48:21.030
What <i>Ammi</i> and Nas don't know
can never find them.

48:22.920 --> 48:23.990
You gotta promise me

48:24.520 --> 48:25.920

48:30.440 --> 48:31.715

48:54.440 --> 48:55.760
SADIA: We closed late.

48:56.560 --> 48:58.233
I had cues out the door.

48:58.400 --> 49:00.756
Everyone and their grandmother
asking me

49:01.320 --> 49:03.676
why the police came to
arrest my boy.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.434
So what do I tell them?

49:10.720 --> 49:11.836
You don't want to answer?

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
I can't.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.596
You can't?

49:18.280 --> 49:20.158
Then, I can't have you in this house.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.834
And I can't have you near Nasir.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.434
You want to waste your future, fine.

49:23.600 --> 49:24.920
He still has his.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.229
You have to leave.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.793
Hang on, no you don't...

49:31.520 --> 49:33.159
That's not necessary.
<i>Ammi</i>, come on.

49:33.480 --> 49:34.800
They already released me,
I'm not

49:35.000 --> 49:36.880

I don't believe you.

49:36.960 --> 49:39.714
I called your work.
They haven't see you for weeks.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.280
You don't understand. It...

49:41.680 --> 49:43.831
It's all done, we're good now.
SADIA: No.

49:44.040 --> 49:46.509
We're not "good" and I don't understand,
so please explain

49:46.600 --> 49:49.069
why are the police in my house
dragging you out of bed?

49:52.240 --> 49:53.674

letting her kick him out?

50:35.480 --> 50:36.550
She's not even our mum.

50:36.640 --> 50:37.756
HANIF: Don't say that, Nas.

50:37.920 --> 50:39.479
It's just a little disagreement.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.274
These things are complicated!

50:41.360 --> 50:43.176
NASIR: She's not my mum.

You're the one that's gotta sleep

Talk about how many arseholes
and dirt bags have been back here.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.120
Probably already got the fleas.

54:25.960 --> 54:27.030
HOLLY: We need your help.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.039
No, whatever it is, no.

54:29.160 --> 54:31.072
The cell's set up the same
as Rotterdam.

54:31.160 --> 54:32.958
Two of the members
are from Sal's gym.

54:33.120 --> 54:35.157
Great, go get 'em.
We can't make any arrests

54:35.240 --> 54:36.310
without reasonable cause.

54:36.920 --> 54:39.515
We just need someone to look inside
and tell us who's there.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.592
I should be laughing in your face.

54:42.640 --> 54:43.790
Thinking I wanna help you

54:43.920 --> 54:46.151
after how much you've fucked
my life upside down.

54:46.200 --> 54:47.200
HOLLY: But you're not.

54:47.560 --> 54:50.632
And you could have quit at any time.
Could have stopped answering the phone.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.872
But you didn't.
RAZA: What are you on about?

54:52.960 --> 54:54.838
This geezer made me do it.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.036
HOLLY: Made you?

54:56.840 --> 54:57.910
Made you do what?

54:58.280 --> 55:01.000
It was your choice to pick up
that bike helmet.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.670
To take that money from Igli Gramos.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.674
To set fire to that car.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.296
GABE: Yeah, we heard about that.

55:07.320 --> 55:08.320
HOLLY: Listen...

55:08.360 --> 55:10.033
You can go back to packing
those boxes

55:10.080 --> 55:11.833
or you can help us save some lives.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.789
Come on Raza!

55:14.120 --> 55:15.679
You're a racehorse.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.597
You know they shoot
those fuckers in the end, right?

55:19.720 --> 55:20.915
Turn them into glue.

55:22.160 --> 55:23.833
HOLLY: Sleep on it if you want.

55:25.600 --> 55:26.716
What's the point?

55:28.120 --> 55:29.839
Just gives those dickheads more time.

55:31.040 --> 55:32.040
Good man.

55:36.600 --> 55:37.795
RAZA: See you later then.

55:50.360 --> 55:51.953

56:26.800 --> 56:28.359
Sal was saying you trained with him.
