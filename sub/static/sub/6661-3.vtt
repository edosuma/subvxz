LOOKS LIKE
AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.

09:14.885 --> 09:17.958
YOU THINK THE EXTERMINATOR'S
THE ESCAPED SOUL?

09:17.958 --> 09:19.089
I DON'T KNOW.

09:19.089 --> 09:21.592
THE SOUL KILLS PEOPLE
WITH BUGS.

09:21.592 --> 09:22.663
OH, HEAD'S UP.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.064
DISPATCH, I GOT TROUBLE.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.335
THIS PLACE IS SWARMING
WITH BUGS.

09:25.335 --> 09:26.196
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

09:26.196 --> 09:28.238
I'M CALLING PUBLIC WORKS
IN ON THIS ONE.

09:28.238 --> 09:31.902
THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FUMIGATE
THE WHOLE COMPLEX.

09:33.644 --> 09:35.045
[SLAMS CAR DOOR]
WHAT DO WE DO?

09:35.045 --> 09:37.708
I DON'T KNOW.
I LEFT THE VESSEL
AT THE BENCH.

09:37.708 --> 09:38.078
WHAT?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.610
WE WERE GETTING FOOD.
I DIDN'T THINK WE'D NEED IT.

09:39.610 --> 09:42.012
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
MANAGEMENT THINKING,
IS IT, SAM?

09:42.012 --> 09:43.984
ALL RIGHT.

09:47.217 --> 09:49.059
LOOK, LOOK!

09:52.823 --> 09:53.864
IT'S LOCKED.

09:53.864 --> 09:54.995
IT'S LOCKED, IT'S LOCKED!

09:54.995 --> 09:57.898
UH, YEAH, GOOD THINKING,
GOOD THINKING!

10:00.771 --> 10:02.072
WHOA!

10:02.072 --> 10:04.935
[ALL YELLING]

10:22.693 --> 10:26.256
GUESS HE'S NOT
THE ESCAPED SOUL.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.204
BUG.

10:36.967 --> 10:38.068
OH!

10:38.068 --> 10:39.409
RELAX, THERE'S NO BUGS ON YOU!

10:39.409 --> 10:41.772
THEY GOT IN MY PANTS,
SAM. IN MY PANTS!

10:41.772 --> 10:42.973
I KNOW, I KNOW,
THEY GOT EVERYWHERE.

10:42.973 --> 10:46.176
SO THE SOUL IS IN
THE APARTMENT COMPLEX.

10:46.176 --> 10:46.947
MAKES SENSE.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.049
THE EXTERMINATOR
TRIED TO KILL THE BUGS,

10:49.049 --> 10:50.080
SO THE SOUL MADE THE BUGS
KILL HIM.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.083
OK, BUT THE PROBLEM IS,
THERE'S A DOZEN HOUSES
IN THERE,

10:53.083 --> 10:55.055
SO WHERE DOES
THE SOUL LIVE?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.156
UGH.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.388
SOCK, BEES ARE NOT NESTING
IN YOUR CROTCH.

10:58.388 --> 10:59.659
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.692
UGH! I THOUGHT
THESE MIGHT HELP US

11:01.692 --> 11:03.133
FIND OUT
WHERE THE SOUL LIVES.

11:03.133 --> 11:05.095
YOU STOLE MAIL?
YEAH.

11:05.095 --> 11:06.436
SOCK, THAT'S A FELONY.

11:06.436 --> 11:08.799
WELL, COME ON NOW,
THERE'S A FINE LINE
BETWEEN A FELONY

11:08.799 --> 11:10.941
AND DOING SOMETHING
REALLY SUPER COOL.

11:10.941 --> 11:12.172
THAT'S TRUE.

11:15.405 --> 11:18.779

11:20.981 --> 11:23.083
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.

11:23.083 --> 11:23.914
I KNOW WHO THAT IS.

11:23.914 --> 11:25.986

SHE MET AT THAT
MONKEY THING

11:25.986 --> 11:26.857

11:26.857 --> 11:29.089
NOW SHE'S GETTIN'
MARRIED, AND IT'S
ALL YOUR FAULT.

11:29.089 --> 11:29.990
SHE'S NOT GETTING MARRIED.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.292
JUST TAKE THE MAIL
IN THE BACK BEFORE
YOU GET ARRESTED.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.163
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:33.163 --> 11:35.866

MORE OFTEN, YOU'D KNOW.

11:35.866 --> 11:37.768
Andi: 'CAUSE
IF YOU DON'T
PARTY ALL THE TIME.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.169
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
DO IN COLLEGE.

11:54.945 --> 11:56.947
THOUGH I'M HOPING
TO SEE HER MORE OFTEN.

11:56.947 --> 12:00.050
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO CONVINCE ME TO GO
TO SCHOOL FULL-TIME,

12:00.050 --> 12:02.452
WHICH I THINK
IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

12:02.452 --> 12:03.293
I DON'T SEE WHY.

DO YOU REALIZE
HOW SMART SHE IS?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.097
YEAH, OH, YEAH,

NO TIME TO STUDY, SO...

12:12.903 --> 12:15.265
WELL, YOU'D HAVE
TO QUIT THIS JOB.

ABOUT ME GOING BACK

18:50.830 --> 18:53.203
JUST PUT IT IN.

18:53.203 --> 18:55.165
THIS IS IT.

18:55.165 --> 18:56.236
I SHOULD TEST IT OUT.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.238
NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD, SINCE I--

18:58.238 --> 19:00.910
[BOTH YELLING]

19:03.443 --> 19:04.914
OH! OH! NO!

19:04.914 --> 19:06.176

19:10.580 --> 19:13.183
[BOTH PANTING]

19:13.883 --> 19:16.756
THAT WAS ME.
THAT WAS MY FAULT.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.728
REALLY.

19:22.332 --> 19:24.864
[BUZZING]

19:39.679 --> 19:43.213
BAD NEWS.
BEN BROKE THE VESSEL.

19:43.213 --> 19:45.655
SHHH.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.320

20:02.632 --> 20:04.374
GO, GO, GO!

20:31.461 --> 20:32.332
OK, SO WE KNOW
WHERE THE SOUL IS.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.534
AS SOON AS BEN FIXES
THE VESSEL, WE GO BACK
AND WE NAIL HIM.

20:34.534 --> 20:38.508
SAM, I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING, OK?

20:38.508 --> 20:40.710
THIS GUY
CONTROLS...BUGS.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.572
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM

20:42.572 --> 20:43.813
SO HE DOESN'T DO IT AGAIN.

20:43.813 --> 20:47.847
BUGS, SAM!
BUGS THAT KILL PEOPLE.

20:47.847 --> 20:48.818
I'M SORRY, I'M OUT.

20:48.818 --> 20:49.849
LOOK, YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS, OK?

20:49.849 --> 20:53.323
THIS IS MY DEAL.
IF IT'S TOO MUCH,
I--I UNDERSTAND.

20:53.323 --> 20:54.424
UGH.

20:54.424 --> 20:56.856
Ben: THINK I FOUND
THE PROBLEM.

20:56.856 --> 20:57.557
THERE'S A SHORT.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.859
AND THIS THING
WAS NEVER GONNA
WORK RIGHT, ANYWAY.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.292
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?
CAN YOU FIX IT?

21:02.292 --> 21:05.395
OF COURSE. JUST HAVE
TO ORDER THE PARTS,
WHICH WILL TAKE A DAY,

21:05.395 --> 21:09.769
AND YOU AND ME CAN
SEND THIS GUY BACK
TO HELL IN A TOASTER.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.000
ACTUALLY...

21:11.000 --> 21:13.303
LET ME TAKE CARE
OF THIS ONE ON MY OWN, BENJI.

21:13.303 --> 21:15.545
I DON'T WANT YOU

MAYBE HE'S LONELY.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.301

I'M TAKING CLASSES,
PREREQUISITES FOR
COLLEGE NEXT SEMESTER.

22:30.119 --> 22:31.921
I WAS THINKING OF A WAY
TO TELL YOU.

22:31.921 --> 22:35.725
WAIT--WAIT, YOU'RE LEAVING?

22:35.725 --> 22:37.527
I'M REAL--

22:37.527 --> 22:39.929
I'M REALLY SORRY.

22:41.731 --> 22:43.963
AWKWARD...

22:43.963 --> 22:45.034
FOR...

22:45.034 --> 22:45.935
BOTH OF YOU.

22:45.935 --> 22:48.798

22:57.977 --> 23:02.482
TO ANDI, THANK GOD
YOU FINALLY MADE IT OUT
OF THAT DUMP.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.914
WELL, IT STILL DOES NOT
COMPUTE FOR ME.

23:04.914 --> 23:07.056
WHAT, GROWING UP?

23:07.056 --> 23:08.558
HA HA HA, HILARIOUS.

23:08.558 --> 23:10.389
NO, I AM GROWN UP,
JOSIE, OK?

23:10.389 --> 23:12.492
I CAN DRINK,
AND I CAN VOTE.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.594
WHEN THE HELL
HAVE YOU EVER VOTED?

23:14.594 --> 23:14.864
UNIMPORTANT.

23:14.864 --> 23:17.697
LOOK, YAY, YES,
WE'RE ALL VERY
HAPPY FOR ANDI,

23:17.697 --> 23:19.629
BUT CAN SOMEONE
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME

23:19.629 --> 23:20.630
THE ATTRACTION
TO COLLEGE?

23:20.630 --> 23:23.633
YEAH, 'CAUSE I WANT
A CAREER ONE DAY,
NOT JUST A JOB.

23:23.633 --> 23:24.634
Josie: EXACTLY.

23:24.634 --> 23:25.675
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

23:25.675 --> 23:26.436
Sock: YES.
NO, I DON'T.

23:26.436 --> 23:27.507
I'M SORRY, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

23:27.507 --> 23:30.980
OK, WELL, I'M NEVER GOING
TO BUY A HOUSE OFF OF
WORK BENCH WAGES, EVER.

23:30.980 --> 23:31.841
I HAVE A HOUSE.

23:31.841 --> 23:33.713
IT'S YOUR MOM'S HOUSE.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.114
NO, BUT I--BUT
I LIVE IN IT, OK?

23:35.114 --> 23:38.688
AND SOMEBODY PAYS THE BILLS,
SOMEBODY COOKS THE FOOD,

23:38.688 --> 23:40.450
AND SOMEBODY
DOES THE LAUNDRY.

23:40.450 --> 23:42.492
SO I PUT IT TO YOU GUYS,
THE TABLE.

23:42.492 --> 23:45.995
THE GREAT LIFE,
OR THE GREATEST LIFE?

23:45.995 --> 23:47.927
YOU ARE LEACHING OFF
YOUR MOM,

23:47.927 --> 23:49.559
AND YOU ARE ACTUALLY
DEFENDING IT.

23:49.559 --> 23:51.601
SHE'S A MOM, JOSIE,
SHE LIKES IT.

23:51.601 --> 23:52.862
IT'S AWESOME
FOR HER.

23:52.862 --> 23:55.735
ANDI, DO NOT LISTEN
TO THESE MORONS.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.468
I THINK THAT GOING
BACK TO SCHOOL IS
THE BEST DECISION YOU MADE

23:58.468 --> 24:00.139
SINCE THE LAST TIME
YOU DECIDED TO DO IT,

24:00.139 --> 24:02.472
AND THIS TIME
IT IS GOING TO STICK.

24:02.472 --> 24:03.943
ALL RIGHT.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.821

24:38.748 --> 24:42.051
I KNOW, I KNOW THERE WERE
SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES
WITH THE VESSEL,

24:42.051 --> 24:44.614
BUT I'M GONNA SNAG
THE ESCAPED SOUL TOMORROW.

24:44.614 --> 24:47.617

YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.107
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

25:08.107 --> 25:09.508
GET THE GIRL,
GET THE SOUL.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.612
I DON'T CARE WHICH, MAN,
JUST PULL THAT TRIGGER.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.043

26:39.929 --> 26:43.132
YOU JUST STAY AWAY.
SHE'LL KILL YOU, TOO.

26:43.132 --> 26:45.635
SHE'S EVERYWHERE.

27:53.202 --> 27:56.345
AHEM. TRY THE RED ONE.

27:58.077 --> 28:01.280
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
GO WITH THAT.

ANYTHING SOMETIMES!

28:45.724 --> 28:46.055
A FOG MACHINE?

28:46.055 --> 28:48.958
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO SEE? YOU'RE GOING
TO SUFFOCATE, STUPID!

28:48.958 --> 28:50.229
UNLESS YOU USE
A GAS MASK.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.931
THAT'LL WORK.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.035
TAKE THAT ONE.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.736
DON'T FORGET
THE OLD TOASTER.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.168
OH, YEAH.

28:59.168 --> 29:01.470
DEFINITELY NEED

OK.

29:09.919 --> 29:14.023
SOCK, DO YOU WANT
TO COME WITH ME
TO CAPTURE THE SOUL?

29:15.384 --> 29:17.957
OK.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.330
SO ARE WE GONNA

29:42.812 --> 29:45.114
[SIGHS] I THINK I'M SCREWED.

29:45.114 --> 29:47.016
WHY?

29:47.016 --> 29:47.817
LISTEN TO THIS.
