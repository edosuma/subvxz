00:02.336 --> 00:03.535
<i> You know,</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:05.437
you don't need to stick around
here for my court hearing.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.573
Yeah, no, I really do need
to stick around here

00:07.575 --> 00:09.975
for your court hearing. I told
your vet counselor that I would.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.080
Mr. and Mrs. Hodges,

00:15.082 --> 00:17.349
I'm sorry for skipping school

00:17.351 --> 00:18.650
<i> with Malik, but I am not sorry</i>

00:18.652 --> 00:19.918

00:23.924 --> 00:26.525
JACK:
Okay. Pick a letter.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.762
-Any letter.
-Oh. Um...

00:29.764 --> 00:30.629
"Z."

00:30.631 --> 00:33.832
-"Z." I got it. Uh...
-Yeah, thanks.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.501
Zachary.

00:35.503 --> 00:36.835
Okay.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.037
Zeke.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.038
Mm-hmm.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.339
Zeppelin.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.508
Ooh. But what if
they're all girls?

00:43.477 --> 00:44.843
Zoe?

00:44.845 --> 00:46.045
Mm.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.646
-Zophie.
-(laughs)

00:47.648 --> 00:51.450
-Zusan.
-No, you can't just put Zs
on "S" names.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.053
I'm telling you, Jack,

00:54.055 --> 00:55.954
we can never go back there.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.490
Kevin bit the librarian.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.892
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.027
He bit her on her face
with intent.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.162
JACK:
Okay, so, the kids

01:03.164 --> 01:05.030
are never gonna learn how
to read. It's no big deal.

01:05.032 --> 01:07.699
-Parachute! Parachute!
-What?

01:07.701 --> 01:08.967
-Parachute!
-Okay, okay.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.402
(overlapping chatter)

01:10.404 --> 01:12.037
Parachute it is.
There you go. And...

01:12.039 --> 01:15.074
-parachute!
-(whoops)

01:15.076 --> 01:16.909
-Ooh!
-REBECCA: Parachute.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.978
I dropped Kevin at Sophie's,

01:19.980 --> 01:22.481
Randall at the library,

01:22.483 --> 01:25.517
Kate at the mall,
and I fixed that annoying rattle

01:25.519 --> 01:28.921
in the Wagoneer,
and all before lunch.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.056
I mean, it's a bird.
It's a plane. It's Super Dad.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.992
(laughs) Well, look at you,
man of the year.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.727
Couldn't do it without you.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.663
Well, you'll never have to.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.398
-Oh.
-Yeah.

♪ ♪

01:59.753 --> 02:02.121
I think the spray arm is broken.

02:02.123 --> 02:05.724
Oh. So I don't need
a whole new dishwasher?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.693
Oh, thank God.
That is the last thing

02:07.695 --> 02:09.728
-I need right now.
-(doorbell rings)

02:09.730 --> 02:11.930
I got it!
Don't get it. I'll get it.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.803
Hey.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.037
I missed you, babe.

Hey.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.878
-What's up, Randy?
-What's up?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.146
How you doing, man?
Hey, Rebecca.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.480
-Hi, Marc.
-MARC: How's it going?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.715
KATE:
Damn, college boy.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.782
What, back for more laundry?

02:30.784 --> 02:32.017
You're here, like,
every weekend.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.188
-Hey, Bug, that's not lunch.
-I know.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.623
I'll get something
at the movies.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.892
Oh, Beth and I just saw
<i> Practical Magic.</i>

02:39.894 --> 02:42.060
Oh, the one with Sandra Bullock
and Nicole Kidman together.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.762
-Oh, I've been dying
to see that.
-(Marc chuckles)

02:43.764 --> 02:45.964
But we're not 12-year-old girls.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.000
-You ready?
Good to go? All right.
-KATE: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.469
-All right.
Rebecca, good to see you.
-REBECCA: Bye, guys.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.538
-Have fun.
-Randy, good to see you.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.440
(door closes)

02:55.442 --> 02:57.242
What does Kate see in that guy?

02:57.244 --> 03:01.580
Honestly, I'm just happy
that she's happy.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.683
And you, Mom? How you doing?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.818
These mortgage payments
are eating away

03:06.820 --> 03:08.587
at what's left
of the insurance money,

03:08.589 --> 03:11.190
and I really need to get a job,
but I'm not...

03:11.192 --> 03:13.091
(sighs) I'm sorry.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.493
I'm sorry. I-I...

03:14.495 --> 03:16.562
I don't want you to worry.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.831
Since I'm already here,

03:19.833 --> 03:21.200
you know,
we could look at your résumé.

03:21.202 --> 03:24.703
That is a very sweet
but unnecessary offer.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.206
And I'm sure you have a ton of
schoolwork you have to work on.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.840
I already knocked out
next week's reading,

03:28.842 --> 03:30.709
(chuckles):
Mom, I'm a huge nerd.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.078
Résumés are my jam.
Like, I live for them.

<i> Look, um, Cassidy...</i>

04:04.311 --> 04:05.744
We're both adults.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.013
You're single. I'm separated.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.549
Nobody did anything wrong.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.718
You're okay, though?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.052
Because the last thing
I want to do

04:14.054 --> 04:16.555
is make your life
more complicated.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.523
I'm fine.

-I'll...
-You'll what? (scoffs)

04:23.664 --> 04:25.564

04:26.567 --> 04:28.734
Probably not.

<i>You slept with her, didn't you?</i>

That's why Cassidy hasn't been
at AA all week?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.091
Not gonna talk about that
with you.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.693
Let me ask you something.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.896
Just out of curiosity here.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.032
What's wrong with you?

05:02.603 --> 05:06.305
I mean,
I thought you were trying

05:06.307 --> 05:09.207
to help the poor kid fix
her marriage, not destroy it.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.344
You're like
a human wrecking ball.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.948
Yeah.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.719
Yeah, thanks for the pep talk.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.055
NICKY:
No, I'm serious.
Explain it to me.

What kind of person
does that, huh?

05:27.227 --> 05:29.261
Huh?

05:32.232 --> 05:35.067
Shame on you.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.072
Shame on you.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.951
REBECCA:
I'm so glad

05:52.953 --> 05:54.619
I could make it out early
for Thanksgiving.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.626
all these period details.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.994
How's his visit
with his kids going?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.996
Oh, it's good.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.865
He is gonna take the train down

06:06.867 --> 06:08.166
from New York
in time for dinner, though.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.134
RANDALL:
Okay.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.136
Mom and I are off
for our tour of Philly.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.105
Tess, Annie, let's go, girls.

06:13.107 --> 06:16.007
The playdate express
is leaving the station.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.310
Can't wait for some quality
"R" and "R" time.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.813
That's, uh,
that's Randall and Rebecca.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.382
-I know, baby. I know.
-See what I'm saying?

06:23.384 --> 06:24.983
-Hey, uh-uh.
-What?

06:24.985 --> 06:27.285
That is for Deja
and Malik's movie date.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.987
DEJA:
It's not a date.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.123
A date is when
you go out somewhere alone.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.391
BETH:
Well, them's the rules.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.959
Chaperoned dates only.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.293
We all agreed.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.195
Besides,
you won't even know I'm here.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.364
You'll be in the living room.
I'll stay in the kitchen.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.833
The kitchen and the living room
are the same room.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.039
-(coos)
-KATE: I just want him to take

06:48.041 --> 06:50.075
one bite of the banana.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.178
He should've tried solid food
at least two weeks ago.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.180
Here's a theory.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.882
Maybe baby doesn't like banana.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.917
Everybody likes banana.
It's the healthy snack

06:58.919 --> 07:00.719
-that comes in its own wrapper.
-Well,

07:00.721 --> 07:02.421
-maybe we could try
something else.
-Well, no.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.356
We can't, because you can only
introduce one food at a time

07:04.358 --> 07:05.991
in case there's
an allergic reaction.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.325
That's why I made
the baby food chart

07:07.327 --> 07:09.161
to match the daddy food chart.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.996
Right.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.764
Well, then, Jack,

07:12.766 --> 07:13.899
it's boob juice until dinner.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.435
I got to squeeze in a gym sesh
before my staff meeting,

07:16.437 --> 07:17.836
so maybe we'll try again later.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.371
You know what? I really want

07:19.373 --> 07:21.173
-to keep trying now.
-No, babe, babe, babe.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.340
Please wait for me, all right?

07:22.342 --> 07:24.743
I already missed first rollover

07:24.745 --> 07:26.411
and first sit up.
I don't want to miss

07:26.413 --> 07:28.413
first solid food.

07:28.415 --> 07:31.183
-But I'll try to leave work
early, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.717
-I love you, Kate.
-Love you.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.718
Jack.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.020
Mwah. Okay, bye.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.055
Did you feel Daddy's kiss?

07:38.225 --> 07:40.258
(door closes)

07:41.795 --> 07:45.464
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.532
I don't have bacon.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.734
I don't have eggs.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.970
But I got coffee.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.039
-Hey.
-(knocks on door)

07:54.041 --> 07:56.274
Kevin, look, uh,
you know, my, uh...

07:56.276 --> 07:59.010
my court hearing's
this afternoon.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.916
I'm sorry if I was rough on you
the other day,

08:04.918 --> 08:07.919
but you've beaten yourself up
enough. I'm coming in.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.899
(ringing)

08:25.305 --> 08:27.272
Yeah?

08:27.274 --> 08:28.807
Oh, uh, hey, it's Nicky.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.842
Um, is the kid with you?

08:30.844 --> 08:33.011
No, we haven't spoken all week.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.446
Well, he's just...
He's locked himself

08:34.448 --> 08:37.082
in the trailer
since you morons slept together.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.185
<i> But now he's gone,</i>
<i> and he left his phone here.</i>

08:40.187 --> 08:42.287
<i> It's not like him</i>
<i> to just take off.</i>

08:42.289 --> 08:45.490
Nicky, I've got my own crap
going on over here.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.492
I mean, I just... I just signed
the divorce papers.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.928
Cassidy, how many times

08:49.930 --> 08:52.097
have I ever picked up the phone
and called you?

08:53.534 --> 08:55.534
Yeah. Right, okay.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.469
I'm on my way.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.170
I think I overdressed
for this interview.

09:06.172 --> 09:08.038
.
Kaufmanto have you. lucky

09:10.009 --> 09:11.876
Thank you for all your help,
sweetheart.

09:11.878 --> 09:12.810
I really appreciate it.

09:14.180 --> 09:18.749
But you don't have to worry
about me, okay?

09:18.751 --> 09:20.885
Ever.

09:23.556 --> 09:27.191
So, if you could, uh,
picture me grocery shopping

09:27.193 --> 09:28.759
with three toddlers,
you'll understand

09:28.761 --> 09:30.694
I know all about multitasking.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.096
-(both chuckle)
-I'm sure you do.

09:32.098 --> 09:34.965
-Yeah.
-Oh, triplets. Wow.

09:34.967 --> 09:37.635
-Yeah.
-Oh, uh, you're familiar

09:37.637 --> 09:39.737
with our purchasing
and scheduling software?

09:39.739 --> 09:43.073
Uh, if I'm honest, I-I'm not.

09:43.075 --> 09:45.242
But I am computer proficient,

09:45.244 --> 09:47.478
and I type 85 words a minute,
so...

09:47.480 --> 09:50.447
I'm sure I can handle
whatever software you use.

09:55.555 --> 09:57.221

Mr. Simons,

10:02.628 --> 10:04.695
-thank you so much
for your time.
-Sure.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.934
-How'd it go?
-Okay.

10:09.936 --> 10:12.469
I think I sweat out
all the liquid in my body.

10:12.471 --> 10:14.638
I'm gonna go freshen up
for a second.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.106
-Do you want to grab the car?
-Oh.

10:16.108 --> 10:18.075
Okay, thanks.

10:18.077 --> 10:21.045
-I'll need to see
some more applicants.
-(door closes)

10:27.520 --> 10:28.919
Huh? N..

10:28.921 --> 10:30.621
SHAY:
Rebecca Pearson is here!

10:30.623 --> 10:32.022
Mrs. Pearson,
so good to see you again.

10:32.024 --> 10:34.191
-Hi. Oh, a hug. Ooh!
-Hi. Welcome.

10:34.193 --> 10:37.127
You know, Randall tells
a lot of stories

10:37.129 --> 10:40.130
about his family,
like,<i> a lot</i> a lot.

10:40.132 --> 10:42.266
Like, more than anyone, ever,
in human history.

10:42.268 --> 10:44.268
Okay, let's give her
some space, please.

10:44.270 --> 10:45.869
You guys are very sweet.

10:45.871 --> 10:49.106
I am just...
I'm very proud of Randall.

10:49.108 --> 10:51.609
My son, the congressman.

10:51.611 --> 10:53.644
-SHAY: Oh.
-It's, uh, councilman, Mom.

10:53.646 --> 10:55.045
-I'm a councilman.
-JAE-WON: Congressman, no.

10:55.047 --> 10:56.246
-Councilman.
-Hey, I... I like

10:56.248 --> 10:59.049
-the sound of that.
-Hey, one job at a time,
Jae-Dubs.

10:59.051 --> 11:01.685
-Now, is it okay
if I take pictures?
-JAE-WON: Oh, of course.

11:01.687 --> 11:02.820
REBECCA:
Yeah? You don't mind?

11:02.822 --> 11:04.822
-No.
-All right. Maybe, uh...

11:04.824 --> 11:07.224
-You want to see
the rest of the office?
-the two of you. Ready?

11:07.226 --> 11:08.993
-One, two, three.
-(Jae-Won chuckles)

11:08.995 --> 11:10.961
-Nice. Oh.
-Jae-Won. Nice.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.163
-Randall Pearson.
-(laughs): Yeah.

11:13.165 --> 11:15.532
-There's more to it, Mom.
-No, I know.

11:15.534 --> 11:17.868
I just want to take pictures
along the way. All right.

11:17.870 --> 11:19.303
Wow.

11:19.305 --> 11:20.671
I like these maps, too.

11:20.673 --> 11:22.172
This carpet is really...

11:22.174 --> 11:23.841
-(camera clicking)
-I just want to make sure

11:23.843 --> 11:26.310
I get every angle here.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.312
-Let me see.
This is your office?
-Yes, ma'am.

11:28.314 --> 11:29.747
-Right here.
-(Rebecca gasps)

11:29.749 --> 11:31.315
Oh, wow, look at the desk.

11:31.317 --> 11:32.316
(camera clicks)

11:32.318 --> 11:34.551
(birds singing)

11:36.022 --> 11:38.022
<i> (knocking)</i>

11:38.024 --> 11:40.691
Oh.

11:40.693 --> 11:42.693
Uh, hi. Are you okay?

11:42.695 --> 11:44.161
It's time for our walk.

11:44.163 --> 11:45.863
I'm having a bad morning.

11:45.865 --> 11:47.031
Join the club.

11:47.033 --> 11:48.732
No. Seriously.

11:48.734 --> 11:51.068
Bad mornings are worse for
people who had massive strokes.

11:51.070 --> 11:52.236
I've got muscle spasms.

11:52.238 --> 11:53.871
Maybe tomorrow.

11:53.873 --> 11:55.873
Do you need help?

11:59.245 --> 12:01.378
All right, well,
don't just stand there.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.913
You're letting the bugs in.

12:05.685 --> 12:06.784
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:06.786 --> 12:07.918
Hey.

12:09.789 --> 12:11.288
BETH:
Hey-hey!

12:11.290 --> 12:13.590
Hey, uh, Mrs....
Mrs. Pearson. Um,

12:13.592 --> 12:15.726
thank you so much
for having me over.

12:15.728 --> 12:17.695
-What's that, popcorn?
-Mm-hmm.

12:17.697 --> 12:19.029
Okay, you two,

12:19.031 --> 12:21.632
just pretend I'm not here.

12:21.634 --> 12:24.268
But also remember,
I will be here the whole time.

12:27.106 --> 12:28.205
Neh!

12:28.207 --> 12:29.740
(Deja and Beth laugh)

12:29.742 --> 12:30.808
You gonna take it?

12:30.810 --> 12:31.942
Neh! You got to be fast.

12:31.944 --> 12:33.243
All right, just take it.
(laughs)

12:33.245 --> 12:34.311
Have fun, y'all.

12:36.382 --> 12:38.816
MAN: So, I told you what
happened when I took my wife

12:38.818 --> 12:40.751
out to Pittsburgh
to do some shopping last week.

12:40.753 --> 12:43.620
Okay, so, we found this...
(continues indistinctly)

12:44.990 --> 12:47.391
So, as he comes by us,

12:47.393 --> 12:49.393
Crosby bumps our table,

12:49.395 --> 12:51.161
knocks over her glass,

12:51.163 --> 12:53.997
gets red wine
all down her dress.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.666
So I sucker-punch him.

12:55.668 --> 12:57.434
MAN 2:
You sucker-punched
Sidney Crosby?

12:57.436 --> 12:58.969
MAN:
It was a new dress.

12:58.971 --> 13:01.338
-(men laughing)
-Another club soda?

13:01.340 --> 13:02.773
Yeah.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.410
(coughing)

13:06.412 --> 13:08.412
Just so we're clear, uh,

13:08.414 --> 13:11.281
you're telling a story
about how you sucker-punched

13:11.283 --> 13:13.984
Pittsburgh Penguins captain
Sidney Crosby

13:13.986 --> 13:16.019
for accidentally spilling wine

13:16.021 --> 13:17.421
on your wife's dress?

13:17.423 --> 13:18.822
Yeah.

13:18.824 --> 13:20.190
Okay.

13:20.192 --> 13:22.326
I mean,
there's no way that happened.

13:22.328 --> 13:24.128
(chuckles):
But... but okay.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.996
Buddy...

13:25.998 --> 13:28.766
you looking for trouble?

13:28.768 --> 13:31.001
No, no, I don't have
to look for trouble.

13:31.003 --> 13:33.137
Trouble always finds me.

13:33.139 --> 13:35.405
Like a human wrecking ball,
actually.

13:35.407 --> 13:38.809
Aren't you that actor that's
been hanging around town?

13:38.811 --> 13:41.779
Let me ask you a question.
Uh, do you love your wife?

13:41.781 --> 13:43.947
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.149
She love you?

13:45.151 --> 13:46.950
Of course.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.720
I bet you a hundred bucks I can
get her to take her clothes off

13:49.722 --> 13:50.888
within 20 minutes
of meeting her.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.322
What did you say?

13:52.324 --> 13:54.892
Actually, you know what,
I might have overshot.

13:54.894 --> 13:57.795
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Here, I'll bet you ten dollars

13:57.797 --> 14:00.230
that I can get your wife
out of that wine-stained dress

14:00.232 --> 14:01.932
within five minutes
of meeting her.

14:02.902 --> 14:04.401
What do you think? Huh?

14:04.403 --> 14:06.370
-There it is. Come on.
-(chair clatters)

14:14.070 --> 14:15.904
Can I help you?

14:15.906 --> 14:17.873
.
I'm Rebecca Pearson's son.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.641
Uh, sh-she was just in here.

14:19.643 --> 14:21.910
She and my father adopted me

14:21.912 --> 14:23.979
when I was left
at a fire station

14:23.981 --> 14:25.781
and raised me as their own.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.783
That's the kind
of person she is.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.651
Did she tell you that?

14:29.653 --> 14:30.986
Uh, no.

14:30.988 --> 14:33.722
That's also the kind
of person she is.

14:33.724 --> 14:36.058
Did she tell you
my father died last year,

14:36.060 --> 14:37.726
saving our lives
in a house fire?

14:39.797 --> 14:41.830
Jesus.

14:41.832 --> 14:43.999
-No.
-Of course not.

14:44.001 --> 14:46.135
Because...
she's not the type of person

14:46.137 --> 14:48.637
to tell you a sob story
to try to get a job.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.105
But you are?

14:50.107 --> 14:52.040
Oh, absolutely.

14:53.978 --> 14:55.911
Your mom's lucky to have you.

14:55.913 --> 14:58.547
I can barely get my son
to return my calls.

14:59.784 --> 15:02.351
She seems like a great person.

15:02.353 --> 15:04.153
She certainly raised
a great kid.

15:04.155 --> 15:07.656
But she doesn't know how
to use the software,

15:07.658 --> 15:09.725
and I don't have the time
to train her.

15:11.028 --> 15:13.662
Sir, I graduated
top of my class.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.865
I have a full scholarship
with Carnegie Mellon.

15:16.867 --> 15:19.101
I'll teach her any software
you need by Monday morning.

15:19.103 --> 15:20.869
Please.

15:20.871 --> 15:23.672
Sh-She just needs a chance.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.611
Oh, hey.

15:29.613 --> 15:32.848
I was just grabbing my bag.

15:32.850 --> 15:35.417
-You ready?
-Yeah.

15:37.721 --> 15:39.888
Mm.

15:39.890 --> 15:42.724
Mm! Everybody's all about

15:42.726 --> 15:44.159
-the Philly cheesesteak...
-Mm-hmm.

15:44.161 --> 15:46.895
...but my money's
on the roast pork from DiNic's

15:46.897 --> 15:48.463
as the best sandwich
in Philadelphia.

15:48.465 --> 15:50.065
-I ordered these in special.
-Mm!

15:50.067 --> 15:51.867
-It's delicious. Mm-hmm.
-Right?

15:51.869 --> 15:53.869
-All right, so...
-Hmm?

15:53.871 --> 15:55.204
...tell me about life in L.A.

15:55.206 --> 15:57.072
(sighs)

15:57.074 --> 15:58.874
Um...

15:58.876 --> 16:00.943
it's-it's lovely.

16:02.413 --> 16:03.979
That's it?

16:03.981 --> 16:05.147
(both chuckle)

16:05.149 --> 16:07.049
-Any celebrity sightings?
-No.

16:07.051 --> 16:08.917
Don't you want to complain
about the traffic

16:08.919 --> 16:11.153
-or how there's no weather?
-Mm. No.

16:11.155 --> 16:13.922
I want to show you pictures
of the baby.

16:13.924 --> 16:16.458
Okay.

16:17.695 --> 16:19.695
Where is my phone?

16:20.598 --> 16:22.598
I just had it.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.900
-Mom, it's okay.
-Come on. No,

16:24.902 --> 16:26.568
it was really expensive.

16:26.570 --> 16:30.205
And Miguel splurged
when I told him not to.

16:30.207 --> 16:31.874
RANDALL:
I'm sure it's in here. Hey.

16:31.876 --> 16:33.108
REBECCA:
Where could it be?

16:33.110 --> 16:34.743
I mean, I just had it.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.212
-Are you kidding me?
-Mom, it's okay.

16:37.214 --> 16:39.014
-I'll just call it.
-I really need

16:39.016 --> 16:41.083
to find my phone,
though, Randall.

16:41.085 --> 16:42.784
-Okay. Yeah.
-Okay? Can you help me, please?

16:42.786 --> 16:45.187
Yes, ma'am. Hey, guys.

16:45.189 --> 16:46.955
-(ringtone playing)
-Has anybody seen
my mom's phone?

16:46.957 --> 16:48.123
JAE-WON:
Oh. No, I hear it.

16:48.125 --> 16:50.125
Uh...

16:50.127 --> 16:52.094
-Oh. Is it this?
-RANDALL: Hey!

16:52.096 --> 16:54.129
-Hey!
-Oh! Okay.

16:54.131 --> 16:56.198
-Crisis averted, Mrs. Pearson.
-There it is. Thank you.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.467
I'm so sorry.

16:58.469 --> 17:02.104
Um, okay, now I'm gonna show you
pictures of your nephew.

17:06.043 --> 17:07.743
-Come on, sweetheart.
-Yes.

17:07.745 --> 17:09.111
Look at this picture.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.779
-Ah.
-(groans)

17:10.781 --> 17:12.080
Look at that one.

17:12.082 --> 17:14.216
Look at his little face.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.619
(TV playing indistinctly)

17:17.621 --> 17:19.655
I'm not talking
about this anymore.

17:19.657 --> 17:21.623
I thought you said
you wanted to.

17:21.625 --> 17:25.260
(sighs) I told you...
it's just the way it is.

17:25.262 --> 17:27.829
MALIK: Okay, so you can't even
talk to them about it? I mean,

17:27.831 --> 17:29.665
I don't get why you won't
just have the conversation.

17:29.667 --> 17:32.567
And I don't get why you
can't take no for an answer.

17:35.606 --> 17:37.539
Deja.

17:42.146 --> 17:43.812
<i> (knocking, door opens)</i>

17:48.652 --> 17:51.653
-Anything you want
to talk about?
-Just...

17:51.655 --> 17:54.623
please tell him to leave.

17:57.027 --> 17:59.294
-(TV playing indistinctly)
-Hey, Malik?

18:01.832 --> 18:03.665
I think it's best
if you go home.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.667
(chuckles)

18:05.669 --> 18:09.271
Yeah. Yeah, no, it was...
completely my fault.

18:09.273 --> 18:11.139
I pushed her too hard, so...

18:11.141 --> 18:12.674
Yeah.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.676
You pushed her too hard.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.012
And what... what was it,
exactly?

18:17.014 --> 18:19.548
It's not my place.

18:19.550 --> 18:20.983
I'm sorry.

18:20.985 --> 18:22.617
Malik,

18:22.619 --> 18:24.152
if you push my daughter

18:24.154 --> 18:25.854
on something that makes her
uncomfortable,

18:25.856 --> 18:28.256
I have the right
to know what's up.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.831
Deja wants to see her mom.

18:35.833 --> 18:38.700
Her birth mom.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.603
That's what's up.

18:44.908 --> 18:46.708
-Okay.
-GREGORY: Now, this is service.

18:46.710 --> 18:47.843
(chuckles)

18:47.845 --> 18:49.878
-Thank you.
-Sure.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.748
I'm happy you came by. Really.

18:52.750 --> 18:55.650
Are you?
'Cause you don't act like it.

18:55.652 --> 18:57.652
Yeah, I know.
Ever since the stroke,

18:57.654 --> 18:59.821
I have trouble making
my voice and face

18:59.823 --> 19:02.224
express empathy and gratitude.

19:02.226 --> 19:04.126
Doesn't mean I don't have any.

19:13.170 --> 19:15.070
Hey.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.905
We've been looking for you.

19:16.907 --> 19:19.341
-(sighs)
-(turns off engine, sets brake)

19:21.678 --> 19:23.245
Hey, come on.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.418
Wha...?

19:29.420 --> 19:31.453
It's a funny story.

19:31.455 --> 19:33.755
Did you win?

19:33.757 --> 19:36.358
(sighs)

19:36.360 --> 19:39.161
Did you drink?

19:40.097 --> 19:41.863
No.

19:41.865 --> 19:44.232
I thought about it, but no.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.768
Come on.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.336
Let's go.

20:02.386 --> 20:04.219
Well...

20:04.221 --> 20:06.154
I better go get changed.

20:06.156 --> 20:08.390
Why, you got a hot date?

20:08.392 --> 20:10.358
It's Wednesday.

20:17.334 --> 20:19.267
You actually forgot.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.071
Oh. No, your hearing.

20:23.073 --> 20:24.239
Of course. Yes.

20:24.241 --> 20:26.141
I...

20:26.143 --> 20:27.776
I'm sorry.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.714
JACK:
You're sorry.

20:34.284 --> 20:36.384
You're sorry.

20:39.957 --> 20:42.757
Well, I'm sure that'll be
a big help with the judge,

20:42.759 --> 20:45.193
that my character witness
looks like he went 12 rounds

20:45.195 --> 20:46.495
with Mike Tyson.

20:46.497 --> 20:49.464
But you know what?
Just forget it.

20:49.466 --> 20:53.468
I mean, I'm the idiot who threw
the chair through the window.

21:04.815 --> 21:08.316
"I'm sorry" is like a...

21:08.318 --> 21:11.119
It's like a magic word
when you're a kid.

21:11.121 --> 21:13.288
Doesn't matter what you did.

21:13.290 --> 21:16.424
Say you're sorry
and it all goes away.

21:16.426 --> 21:20.295
Then you grow up, and it just...

21:20.297 --> 21:23.165
doesn't work anymore, does it?

21:24.334 --> 21:27.903
No, it doesn't.

21:27.905 --> 21:30.839
I'm sorry.

21:30.841 --> 21:33.441
Me, too.

21:34.411 --> 21:37.045

21:37.047 --> 21:39.447
Yeah.

21:47.615 --> 21:49.850
Okay, a little makeup will cover
this right up.

21:49.852 --> 21:52.286
I will say, for a Marine,

21:52.288 --> 21:53.721

a pretty gentle touch.

21:53.723 --> 21:55.889

your face was an amateur.

21:55.891 --> 21:57.992

a professional can do to you.

21:57.994 --> 21:59.760
Mm.

22:00.997 --> 22:03.530
Growing up, uh,

22:03.532 --> 22:04.665
my dad,

22:04.667 --> 22:07.568
he-he flew a Cessna 150.

22:07.570 --> 22:10.504
He called it
<i> The Screaming Eagle.</i>

22:10.506 --> 22:12.673
Named it after
the 101st Airborne Division.

22:12.675 --> 22:15.476
He was so proud
to be in the 101st.

22:15.478 --> 22:17.344
I didn't know your dad served.

22:17.346 --> 22:19.413
You never mentioned that.

22:19.415 --> 22:21.415
Well, not all of us have to talk

22:21.417 --> 22:22.983

all the time.

22:25.021 --> 22:27.721
-Okay.
-(chuckles)

22:27.723 --> 22:30.891
I never found what my dad did
in the military, though.

22:30.893 --> 22:33.560
Bravery. Heroism.

22:33.562 --> 22:35.596
I kept chasing it.

22:35.598 --> 22:39.767
I enlisted again and again,
thinking...

22:39.769 --> 22:42.436
"This time I'll feel it."

22:42.438 --> 22:46.407
I tried and I tried until...

22:46.409 --> 22:50.477
I just ended up destroying
everything I had back home.

22:53.149 --> 22:57.418
It wasn't you who destroyed
my marriage, Kevin.

22:58.387 --> 23:00.921
I did that all by myself,

23:00.923 --> 23:03.757
way before I met you.

23:08.431 --> 23:09.696
All right.

23:09.698 --> 23:10.931
I did my best.

23:10.933 --> 23:13.567

23:37.993 --> 23:41.862
Ryan takes him to the diner
on Hawthorne for dinner.

23:41.864 --> 23:45.499
Every Wednesday night, I park
across the street and I watch

23:45.501 --> 23:49.903

to walk in and join them.

23:52.108 --> 23:54.575

24:10.926 --> 24:12.926
-Yeah.
-If I try it myself,

24:12.928 --> 24:14.828
it's fifty-fifty
I lose a finger.

-You want to try some?
-Oh, you can try,

-Hello.

33:03.135 --> 33:04.301
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:04.303 --> 33:06.303
Well, how was R & R time?

33:06.305 --> 33:08.072
Oh, it was lovely.

33:08.074 --> 33:11.241
Randall was the perfect
tour guide, of course.

33:11.243 --> 33:14.111
-Hi.
-And I took about a million
pictures on my phone.

33:14.113 --> 33:15.579
She was glued to that phone
all day,

33:15.581 --> 33:17.214
except when she lost it.

33:17.216 --> 33:18.649
What? Again?

33:18.651 --> 33:20.217
Oh, I had to buy her
that new phone

33:20.219 --> 33:21.485
'cause she lost the last one.

33:21.487 --> 33:24.321
Now, the two of you
just leave me be.

33:24.323 --> 33:27.124
I did not lose it, Randall.

33:28.461 --> 33:30.628
Can I talk to you
about Thanksgiving?

33:30.630 --> 33:33.464
Mm-hmm.

33:33.466 --> 33:35.299

Nothing.

KEVIN:
Here we are.

33:56.088 --> 33:57.488
What are you gonna say?

33:57.490 --> 34:00.290
If he won't even let me
sit down and join them,

34:00.292 --> 34:02.159
I'll just...

34:02.161 --> 34:04.428
give him the divorce papers
and walk out.

34:06.198 --> 34:07.765
If he does...?

34:07.767 --> 34:10.300
I'll think of something.

34:10.302 --> 34:13.003
Well, don't be me, Cassidy.

34:13.005 --> 34:16.173
Don't let it take 40 years

34:40.066 --> 34:44.501
