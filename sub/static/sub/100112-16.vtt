00:04.441 --> 00:06.818
Okay, Harris should be here any minute.

00:06.820 --> 00:08.844
Remember, she was just fired.

00:08.846 --> 00:10.669
Her college dreams were crushed.

00:10.671 --> 00:11.726
And by moving back in,

00:11.728 --> 00:13.760
she's losing any shred of independence.

00:13.762 --> 00:15.829
Oh, but don't make a
huge deal out of it.

00:15.831 --> 00:17.464
There's no reason to.

00:17.466 --> 00:20.033
The kid had a rough break,
but she'll bounce back.

00:20.970 --> 00:24.771
None of us ever have,
but I've seen it happen.

00:24.773 --> 00:27.173
I've seen it happen in other families.

00:28.343 --> 00:30.176
Mostly on TV.

00:31.146 --> 00:33.613
I think we all agree
we should stop thinking

00:33.615 --> 00:35.915
of her as lost and hopeless.

00:35.917 --> 00:37.302
Let's start thinking about her

00:37.304 --> 00:40.086
as free childcare for my baby.

00:40.888 --> 00:44.023
Uh, first, let me say I
appreciate you exploiting

00:44.025 --> 00:45.125
my suffering child,

00:45.127 --> 00:47.160
but maybe you can give her a day or two.

00:48.362 --> 00:49.895
Please, nobody say anything.

00:49.897 --> 00:53.298
There she is!

00:53.300 --> 00:55.410
Now, you might not realize this yet,

00:55.412 --> 00:57.870
but nobody learns from their successes.

00:57.872 --> 00:59.705
You only learn from failure.

00:59.707 --> 01:02.041
So when you pull yourself out of this

01:02.043 --> 01:03.275
dark pit of despair,

01:03.277 --> 01:05.510
you're gonna be so much smarter.

01:07.081 --> 01:08.701
I mean, if.

01:08.703 --> 01:11.669
'Cause some people don't make it.

01:13.219 --> 01:15.082
You can stop right there, Jackie.

01:15.084 --> 01:16.888
You pretty much fixed her.

01:18.558 --> 01:19.858
You know what?

01:19.860 --> 01:21.793
You are gonna make it.

01:21.795 --> 01:23.628
You just need a purpose,

01:23.630 --> 01:25.130
like helping others.

01:26.533 --> 01:29.634
And who needs more help than a baby?

01:29.636 --> 01:31.636
Oh, God.

01:33.106 --> 01:34.472
You know what?

01:34.474 --> 01:36.407
I'm starting to think
that a lot of our failures

01:36.409 --> 01:38.009
are because of what happens right here.

02:17.144 --> 02:18.801
"The Conners" is filmed

02:18.803 --> 02:20.625
in front of a live studio audience.

02:20.627 --> 02:22.586
Damn it!

02:22.588 --> 02:26.723
Okay, there's no way
I can afford daycare.

02:26.725 --> 02:28.391
I thought Harris would watch the baby

02:28.393 --> 02:30.793
now that she's home, but
she won't get out of bed.

02:30.795 --> 02:32.362
Let's tell her we found her mattress

02:32.364 --> 02:33.925
on the front lawn after a tornado.

02:33.927 --> 02:35.131
Maybe that'll get her out.

02:35.133 --> 02:39.269
I even put the crib in her room.

02:39.271 --> 02:42.205
But when she woke up, she
put it back in the hall.

02:43.875 --> 02:46.109
Why is this all on Harris?

02:46.111 --> 02:48.111
I thought one of the big
pluses of the Lunch Box

02:48.113 --> 02:49.946
was that you could bring
Beverly Rose to work.

02:49.948 --> 02:52.115
I'm cool with it, but
it turns out nobody else

02:52.117 --> 02:55.417
likes a teething, screaming
baby in a restaurant.

02:56.587 --> 03:00.289
Look, I know you all are
busy, but I'm screwed here.

03:00.291 --> 03:02.491
Does anybody have any
ideas how to help me?

03:02.493 --> 03:04.854
I could take her to the jobsite with me.

03:04.856 --> 03:06.912
There's a Starbucks next door.

03:06.914 --> 03:09.398
I could put a cup of coffee
and a laptop in front of her,

03:09.400 --> 03:12.168
and apparently, she
can sit there all day.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.871
That's not helping.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.141
Have you talked to Emilio about this?

03:18.143 --> 03:20.576
He has family here.
Maybe they'd help out.

03:20.578 --> 03:22.145
I don't know.

03:22.147 --> 03:25.013
Emilio and I don't really
have a relationship.

03:25.015 --> 03:27.650
Wouldn't it be weird to ask
his family for free childcare?

03:27.652 --> 03:31.520
Well, it's better than sticking
her at the coffee place.

03:31.522 --> 03:33.155
If the baby has to use the bathroom,

03:33.157 --> 03:35.457
you know someone's
gonna steal that laptop.

03:37.695 --> 03:40.562
Alright, here it goes.

03:40.564 --> 03:43.131
We're FaceTiming Daddy.

03:45.202 --> 03:47.536
- Hey, Emilio!
- Hey!

03:47.538 --> 03:48.814
Hi, everyone.

03:48.816 --> 03:51.317
I bought something for the
baby I want to show you.

03:53.644 --> 03:58.213
It says, "Forget about
weed. Legalize my daddy".

04:01.884 --> 04:04.051
I appreciate it, but I'm not sure

04:04.053 --> 04:06.487
I want to be the face of this movement.

04:06.489 --> 04:09.490
We wish you were here.

04:09.492 --> 04:11.826
Look, I'm really
struggling to find someone

04:11.828 --> 04:14.028
to take care of the
baby when I'm at work.

04:14.030 --> 04:16.430
Jackie told me you have family here.

04:16.433 --> 04:18.098
Do you think there's any chance

04:18.100 --> 04:19.166
that they could help me out here?

04:19.168 --> 04:21.769
Uh, hola, Emilio. Um...

04:22.839 --> 04:24.794
Um... uh...

04:24.796 --> 04:26.818
_

04:26.820 --> 04:31.820
_

04:34.683 --> 04:37.318
Um, what did she say?

04:37.320 --> 04:42.189
Uh, she say that you were
"nerviosa" about my "familia".

04:42.191 --> 04:43.824
There were lots of clues in there.

04:45.361 --> 04:47.488
My tías have been
watching the family's kids

04:47.490 --> 04:48.762
at their house for years.

04:48.764 --> 04:50.197
I'm sure they would love to help.

04:50.199 --> 04:53.033
And having my family
involved would make me feel

04:53.035 --> 04:55.102
more like I'm part of the baby's life.

04:55.104 --> 04:58.372
Ohh. Wow.

04:58.374 --> 04:59.907
This could be great.

04:59.909 --> 05:02.843
Um, but what if your
aunts don't like me?

05:03.880 --> 05:05.545
They will love you.

05:05.547 --> 05:10.617
Just be sure to cover your
tattoo and wear a cross.

05:13.255 --> 05:16.155
And if you want to get your roots done,

05:16.157 --> 05:17.490
that would be good, too.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.663
Hey, has Harris come
out of her room yet?

05:24.665 --> 05:26.093
No, not since I got here.

05:26.095 --> 05:27.560
She's been in her room this whole time?

05:27.562 --> 05:29.135
It's been like three days.

05:29.137 --> 05:31.004
I just keep trying to think of things

05:31.006 --> 05:33.117
that'll make her feel
better, but I can't.

05:33.119 --> 05:34.340
So I feel like a bad mom.

05:34.342 --> 05:36.976
No, you're a good mom.

05:36.978 --> 05:38.263
I'll tell you what a bad mom is.

05:38.265 --> 05:40.313
My mother told me to go in a closet

05:40.315 --> 05:43.082
and not come out until I was pretty.

05:47.422 --> 05:49.422
I was 4.

05:50.792 --> 05:52.622
And then she spent
the next five years saying,

05:52.624 --> 05:54.757
"What are you doing out here?"

05:56.531 --> 05:59.164
So you just go and love on that girl

05:59.166 --> 06:01.133
because life will beat you up,

06:01.135 --> 06:04.537
and the only thing to protect
you against this cruel world

06:04.539 --> 06:06.061
is a mother's love.

06:06.063 --> 06:08.606
I didn't have that,
and it's taken me years

06:08.608 --> 06:11.709
to get this emotionally... strong.

06:18.352 --> 06:21.786
Um, Jackie, I only have
so much love to give,

06:21.788 --> 06:24.388
and I kinda need to give it to Harris.

06:25.325 --> 06:27.725
Just say I'm pretty.

06:32.365 --> 06:34.632
Hey, pretty girl.

06:39.305 --> 06:41.138
Stop.

06:42.375 --> 06:46.210
Look, I know what it's
like to be depressed.

06:46.212 --> 06:48.980
I haven't always been
this bubbly and carefree.

06:50.216 --> 06:51.382
When I was a teenager,

06:51.384 --> 06:54.385
I went through a really,
really dark period in my life.

06:54.387 --> 06:56.553
Sorry, Mom. I'm not a 14-year-old girl

06:56.555 --> 06:59.023
sad because Oasis broke
up for the third time.

06:59.025 --> 07:02.693
I'm 18, and I just had my
entire future wiped out.

07:02.695 --> 07:05.296
Alright, but we got to get you

07:05.298 --> 07:06.330
out of this bed, okay?

07:06.332 --> 07:09.400
Let's get dressed and do something fun.

07:09.402 --> 07:11.068
There's nothing more depressing

07:11.070 --> 07:14.238
than doing "something
fun" with your mom.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.240
Watch this.

07:16.242 --> 07:18.642
We are gonna make a prank call.

07:20.546 --> 07:22.513
My God, you're really doing this.

07:23.315 --> 07:24.647
Hello?

07:24.649 --> 07:27.617
Is my mommy there?

07:27.619 --> 07:29.452
Who is this?

07:29.454 --> 07:34.224
My mommy left this number,
and she said she'd be there,

07:34.226 --> 07:37.460
and someone's trying
to get into the house.

07:37.462 --> 07:39.695
Oh, my God, honey. I'll call the police.

07:39.697 --> 07:41.131
Where do you live?

07:41.133 --> 07:44.300
In Hell!

07:46.438 --> 07:49.272
Okay, that was so weird

07:49.274 --> 07:51.607
and needlessly cruel.

07:51.609 --> 07:54.210
Now, if you think you
can do better, go for it.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.879
I got it.

08:01.618 --> 08:03.318
Hello!

08:03.320 --> 08:06.388
This is WUPA 93.8,

08:06.390 --> 08:08.323
Lanford's number-one party station,

08:08.325 --> 08:11.726
and the Wupa Money Car is
about to drive by your location!

08:11.728 --> 08:14.129
Just run outside right now and yell,

08:14.131 --> 08:16.464
"I'm a money-loving fool! Wupa!"

08:16.466 --> 08:19.300
and you'll win $500!

08:19.302 --> 08:21.469
Oh, my God! I never won anything!

08:21.471 --> 08:23.437
I'm running out to the car right now!

08:25.341 --> 08:27.475
I'm a money-loving fool!

08:27.477 --> 08:29.343
Wupa! Wupa!

08:31.648 --> 08:32.981
Okay.

08:32.982 --> 08:34.082
Okay.

08:34.083 --> 08:35.583
I yelled, but nobody gave me any money.

08:35.586 --> 08:36.717
I think I missed it.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.953
No, no, it's the next car. Hurry up!

08:38.956 --> 08:41.522
Okay! Still in the game!

08:41.524 --> 08:44.459
I'm a money-loving fool! Wupa!

08:47.362 --> 08:49.830
I don't have anything to
really be nervous about, right?

08:49.832 --> 08:51.364
Right. Just be yourself.

08:51.366 --> 08:52.511
Wait, where's your cross?

08:52.513 --> 08:54.580
Oh. Right.

08:56.807 --> 08:59.071
_

08:59.073 --> 09:01.095
_

09:01.097 --> 09:03.097
_

09:06.295 --> 09:08.682
- Hi! I'm Becky!
- Becky! We know!

09:08.684 --> 09:09.883
Come in.

09:09.885 --> 09:12.486
Ohh. Oh.

09:12.488 --> 09:15.350
Ohh-ho-ho!

09:15.352 --> 09:16.374
Ohh!

09:16.376 --> 09:19.066
She looks just like Emilio!

09:19.068 --> 09:21.425
But so skinny!

09:21.427 --> 09:24.164
Where's the rest of the baby?

09:24.166 --> 09:27.033
Actually, Beverly Rose
is a very healthy baby.

09:27.035 --> 09:29.636
She's in the 50th percentile.

09:29.638 --> 09:31.471
It's so nice to finally meet you, Becky.

09:31.473 --> 09:35.342
I am Emilio's Tía Elsie,
and this is my sister, Ruthie.

09:35.344 --> 09:36.809
It's nice to meet you, too.

09:36.811 --> 09:39.045
- And, uh, this is my Aunt Jackie.
- Hi.

09:39.047 --> 09:42.449
In science, 50th percentile...
it's right in the middle.

09:43.318 --> 09:45.352
No, no, no, no.

09:45.354 --> 09:46.653
Ahh.

09:46.655 --> 09:49.523
This is a healthy baby.

09:50.892 --> 09:52.525
Gordito.

09:52.527 --> 09:55.394
100 percentile.

09:55.396 --> 09:57.319
I remember him

09:57.321 --> 09:59.465
from "Ghostbusters" when
he destroyed New York.

10:03.138 --> 10:07.874
Anyway I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

10:07.876 --> 10:09.401
I've been working double shifts,

10:09.403 --> 10:11.577
and I can't afford daycare right now.

10:11.579 --> 10:14.613
Um, this is a miracle for me.

10:14.615 --> 10:18.051
I've been feeding her every four hours.

10:18.053 --> 10:19.418
Four hours?

10:19.420 --> 10:22.187
Are you trying to get her into a bikini?

10:23.423 --> 10:26.424
But if you want to feed her a
little more, that's okay, too.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.583
You obviously did a
good job with Emilio.

10:29.585 --> 10:32.707
_

10:32.709 --> 10:35.709
_

10:38.139 --> 10:40.161
_

10:40.163 --> 10:42.540
_

10:44.869 --> 10:46.090
Eh.

10:46.092 --> 10:49.915
_

10:49.917 --> 10:51.473
Mm.

10:51.475 --> 10:54.132
Excuse me. I don't speak Spanish.

10:54.134 --> 10:56.453
Oh, we were just talking about putting

10:56.455 --> 10:59.090
Beverly Rose in Gordito's playpen.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.525
Yeah, don't do that. He might eat her.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.527
Uh, we should go, Becky.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.699
Bye, sweetheart.

11:08.701 --> 11:11.535
Mommy will be back.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.706
Thanks for everything.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.011
I'm sorry.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.480
It's just so hard to leave her.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.015
Beverly Rose is gonna be okay, right?

11:25.017 --> 11:26.583
Absolutely.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.585
They seem to love the baby.

11:30.408 --> 11:31.464
But... ?

11:31.466 --> 11:33.844
They called you a "horny old donkey

11:33.846 --> 11:36.136
who bewitched Emilio
with her sex tricks",

11:36.138 --> 11:39.095
and they called me "a welfare lesbian".

11:39.097 --> 11:41.264
What? Really?

11:41.266 --> 11:43.499
Yeah. What do you wanna do?

11:43.501 --> 11:45.334
What can I do?

11:45.336 --> 11:47.536
I don't have any options.

11:47.538 --> 11:49.505
I can't confront them.

11:49.507 --> 11:51.274
I need their help with the baby,

11:51.276 --> 11:52.642
but I can't afford anywhere else.

11:52.644 --> 11:54.778
Okay. You're gonna be
okay coming here every day

11:54.780 --> 11:57.613
and having them talk
crap about you like that?

11:57.615 --> 12:01.517
Um, you saw how they love the baby.

12:01.519 --> 12:02.919
That's what matters.

12:02.921 --> 12:04.687
If they want to call me an old slut,

12:04.689 --> 12:06.656
then I'll just have to deal with it.

12:06.658 --> 12:08.791
Come on. We gotta go to work.

12:09.761 --> 12:11.894
Why does everybody go to "lesbian"?

12:11.896 --> 12:14.463
Is it the haircut or just general vibe?

12:18.989 --> 12:20.396
Come on, you've seen everything.

12:20.398 --> 12:22.725
You're like a little
old lady at Chico's.

12:22.727 --> 12:26.830
Come on! The place just opened,
and I want to look around!

12:26.832 --> 12:28.021
Oh, look!

12:28.023 --> 12:29.732
A helmet with a camera.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.797
The family can sit around every year

12:31.799 --> 12:32.902
and watch how I died.

12:32.904 --> 12:35.730
I-I gotta get back to Harris.

12:35.732 --> 12:37.919
What are you worried about?
Harris is doing better.

12:37.921 --> 12:40.254
Yeah, she's doing better
because I've been there

12:40.256 --> 12:41.288
cheering her up.

12:41.290 --> 12:43.424
She's so down that she's letting me in.

12:43.426 --> 12:45.978
I'm literally keeping her
aloft with cheese balls

12:45.980 --> 12:47.713
and motherly love.

12:48.631 --> 12:51.164
Hey, I reserve the right
to refuse service to anyone.

12:51.166 --> 12:53.601
So screw off, you old fart.

12:53.603 --> 12:55.603
Well, I'll be damned!

12:55.605 --> 12:57.505
Lord Tony!

12:57.507 --> 12:59.607
Hey, good to see ya, Dan! Huh?

12:59.609 --> 13:01.942
Wait. Lord Tony?

13:01.944 --> 13:03.705
That was his nickname
when we rode together

13:03.707 --> 13:05.178
back in the day.

13:05.180 --> 13:07.114
Tony, this is my daughter Darlene.

13:07.116 --> 13:08.849
Oh, my God.

13:08.851 --> 13:10.710
This is Darlene?

13:10.712 --> 13:13.420
I'd come over, and you'd
peek out from behind a wall

13:13.422 --> 13:15.488
and start barking at me.

13:16.558 --> 13:18.325
Well, yeah, you looked
like a crazy person.

13:18.327 --> 13:20.227
I was protecting my family.

13:21.797 --> 13:23.230
So, Dan, you still ridin'?

13:23.232 --> 13:24.597
Not as much as I'd like to.

13:24.599 --> 13:25.822
It's tough in the winter

13:25.824 --> 13:28.481
because I'm on blood
thinners and I get cold.

13:28.483 --> 13:30.472
But once it gets up to 80 or 90,

13:30.474 --> 13:33.565
I just throw on a sweater
and hit the highway.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.309
You look like you're
doing pretty well here.

13:35.311 --> 13:37.311
I am. I just need to hire some help.

13:37.313 --> 13:38.545
You got any free time?

13:38.547 --> 13:42.182
Yeah, I do, but this isn't
what I want to do with it.

13:42.184 --> 13:45.152
On the other hand,
I do have a granddaughter

13:45.154 --> 13:47.653
that just got off her retail gig.

13:47.655 --> 13:50.823
She could use a job, and
I think she'd dig this.

13:50.825 --> 13:51.857
What do you think, Darlene?

13:51.859 --> 13:54.327
Um, I think, uh...

13:54.329 --> 13:55.928
I think I should go home and ask her.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.830
Cool. The sooner she calls, the better.

13:57.832 --> 14:00.299
- Lord Tony?
- Yep?

14:00.301 --> 14:01.834
How much for these glasses?

14:03.972 --> 14:05.338
Those aren't really for riding.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.939
You can only see straight ahead.

14:06.941 --> 14:08.507
That's perfect!

14:08.509 --> 14:10.609
I just want to use them
to block out my family

14:10.611 --> 14:12.378
while I focus on the TV.

14:15.616 --> 14:17.149
Hey.

14:17.151 --> 14:18.384
Check it out.

14:18.386 --> 14:20.353
Harris isn't lying in bed anymore.

14:20.355 --> 14:22.454
She's lying on the couch.

14:23.823 --> 14:27.592
You know... it's kinda nice
having her around again.

14:27.594 --> 14:28.693
Hmm.

14:28.695 --> 14:30.728
Yeah, it is.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.464
Hey, you got a minute?

14:32.466 --> 14:34.665
Uh, yeah, a minute. What's up?

14:34.667 --> 14:36.701
Emilio's aunts.

14:36.703 --> 14:39.504
They love Beverly Rose.
They don't like me.

14:39.506 --> 14:40.671
Hmm.

14:40.673 --> 14:42.240
I know my reasons. What are theirs?

14:44.644 --> 14:48.179
They think I'm trapping
him with my sex tricks.

14:48.181 --> 14:49.411
You got tricks?

14:49.413 --> 14:51.546
Why aren't we talking about that?

14:52.919 --> 14:54.386
I don't have tricks!

14:54.388 --> 14:57.622
Emilio and I were both
drunk. We made a baby.

14:57.624 --> 15:00.725
And now his tías are
only blaming me for it.

15:00.727 --> 15:03.293
They called me a "horny old donkey".

15:04.631 --> 15:07.197
You should never have told me that.

15:07.199 --> 15:10.568
I'm trying to make these women like me.

15:10.570 --> 15:11.903
If Emilio was here,

15:11.905 --> 15:14.005
he could stop them
from treating me that way.

15:14.007 --> 15:15.449
Yeah, I'm on my own, too.

15:15.451 --> 15:17.141
David lives like five minutes away,

15:17.143 --> 15:20.411
and I'm still dealing with
Harris's problems by myself.

15:20.413 --> 15:22.980
How did we both wind
up raising kids alone?

15:22.982 --> 15:27.084
I'm an alcoholic, and
you married a loser.

15:27.086 --> 15:28.919
Yeah, I was hoping for something

15:28.921 --> 15:30.620
a little more uplifting.

15:33.259 --> 15:34.824
Hey, Harris,

15:34.826 --> 15:36.726
there's something
I got to talk to you about.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.629
Sit down. "Crossroads"
with Britney Spears is on.

15:39.631 --> 15:41.598
It's about her having
sex for the first time.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.235
It's the worst movie ever
made. We have to watch it.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.737
Get under the tent with
me, like when I was little.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.339
Ohh.

15:50.443 --> 15:52.943
Um, I'm really enjoying this,

15:52.945 --> 15:54.945
but we got to get you
back out in the real world.

15:54.947 --> 15:56.012
Can't do it.

15:56.014 --> 15:57.331
Can't leave this island

15:57.333 --> 15:59.022
because we're surrounded by hot lava.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.380
Quick, lift up your feet!

16:00.382 --> 16:02.547
Ooh! That was close!

16:04.089 --> 16:06.589
Hey, thanks for helping me through this.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.790
I love you, Mom.

16:09.294 --> 16:10.426
And?

16:10.428 --> 16:11.794
Oh, I love you, too, honey.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.629
I'm sorry. I was in shock.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.106
Oh, hey, uh, Grandpa mentioned something

16:23.108 --> 16:25.674
you wanted to tell me about...
some new bike shop you went to?

16:25.676 --> 16:28.578
Shh. Britney's confusing sex with love.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.083
Hey.

16:37.085 --> 16:39.286
I'm making chocolate-chip
pancakes for Harris.

16:39.288 --> 16:40.311
You want one?

16:40.313 --> 16:41.726
They're supposed to be smiley faces,

16:41.728 --> 16:42.850
but the chocolate melted,

16:42.852 --> 16:45.019
so they look like Alice Cooper.

16:46.128 --> 16:48.295
I just got off the phone with Tony.

16:48.297 --> 16:50.431
Harris never showed
up. It's been two days.

16:50.433 --> 16:52.166
What the hell is going on with her?

16:52.168 --> 16:55.926
Oh, um... it's not entirely her fault.

16:55.928 --> 16:57.618
I-I didn't tell her.

16:57.620 --> 16:58.924
Why not?

16:58.926 --> 17:01.294
She's not ready to go back to work yet.

17:01.296 --> 17:02.628
Says who?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.021
The whole reason she's depressed

17:04.023 --> 17:06.532
is because she got fired
and doesn't have a job.

17:06.535 --> 17:08.334
No, it's deeper than that.

17:08.336 --> 17:10.056
She had to grow up way too fast,

17:10.058 --> 17:12.338
she got kicked in the teeth,
and now she needs a break.

17:12.339 --> 17:16.041
Aw, Darlene, she grew up
way too fast for you.

17:16.044 --> 17:18.510
You're still trying to
hang on to your little girl.

17:18.512 --> 17:20.803
There's nothing wrong
with nurturing your kids

17:20.805 --> 17:22.284
once in a while when they're hurting.

17:22.286 --> 17:24.015
I mean, Jackie told me to love on her.

17:24.017 --> 17:28.520
Oh, well, Jackie...
the picture of mental health.

17:28.521 --> 17:30.455
She's a person to listen to.

17:30.457 --> 17:32.857
Did you have to tell her she was pretty?

17:36.530 --> 17:37.629
That was a lucky guess.

17:37.631 --> 17:39.531
Honey, honey.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.681
The kid freaked out
because she has no way

17:41.683 --> 17:43.134
to support herself.

17:43.136 --> 17:44.969
If you really want to help her,

17:44.971 --> 17:48.173
give her a reason to get
out of bed in the morning.

17:48.175 --> 17:50.576
Let Harris decide what she's ready for.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.845
Fine.

17:53.847 --> 17:57.348
Oh, but just admit one thing.

17:57.350 --> 18:00.082
You were really happy
when Becky and I came home

18:00.084 --> 18:01.952
and you had your
little girls back again.

18:01.954 --> 18:03.354
Yes.

18:03.356 --> 18:05.556
I would have hated to miss
the developmental changes

18:05.558 --> 18:08.792
that happen between
the ages of 43 and 45.

18:13.894 --> 18:17.433
So, listen, uh, I felt a
little tension between us.

18:17.435 --> 18:20.705
It made me nerviosa.

18:20.707 --> 18:24.275
So I made you this photo
album from when she was born.

18:24.277 --> 18:27.578
Now, keep in mind she's tiny
because she was premature,

18:27.580 --> 18:30.146
not because I was starving her.

18:30.148 --> 18:32.915
There's no tension. But thank you.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.685
Ay, la cochina está...
está tratando De...

18:35.687 --> 18:37.587
Okay, let's get this out in the open.

18:37.589 --> 18:39.623
I worked in a Mexican restaurant,

18:39.625 --> 18:42.825
so I know that "cochina" means "slut".

18:42.827 --> 18:45.094
And my Aunt Jackie is fluent in Spanish,

18:45.096 --> 18:48.030
so she told me everything
you said about me.

18:48.032 --> 18:50.367
The lesbian speaks Spanish!

18:52.304 --> 18:55.171
She's not a lesbian.
It's just the haircut.

18:55.173 --> 18:57.741
And I am not a cochina!

18:57.743 --> 18:59.542
I don't know why you're judging me,

18:59.544 --> 19:02.445
but I don't deserve it, and
I'm not gonna put up with it.

19:02.447 --> 19:04.413
If you can't treat me with respect,

19:04.415 --> 19:06.282
I can't bring my baby here.

19:06.284 --> 19:07.916
Of course. You're gonna make the baby

19:07.918 --> 19:11.019
disappear from our lives like
you made Emilio disappear.

19:12.130 --> 19:13.653
What are you talking about?

19:13.655 --> 19:15.920
Emilio got deported because of you.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.812
I had nothing to do with
that. Is that what he told you?

19:18.814 --> 19:20.929
No. He's too nice.

19:20.931 --> 19:22.979
He would never say
anything bad about you.

19:22.981 --> 19:24.633
- But we know.
- Hmm.

19:24.635 --> 19:26.935
What do you know?

19:26.937 --> 19:28.470
He was taken by ICE.

19:28.472 --> 19:30.572
Yes, because you make
him work extra hours

19:30.574 --> 19:32.908
so he could give you money for the baby.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.777
He had two extra jobs,

19:34.779 --> 19:36.844
and one of them was where they got him.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.680
I didn't tell him to take an extra job.

19:38.682 --> 19:40.080
That was his idea.

19:40.082 --> 19:42.950
And I would never do
anything to hurt Emilio.

19:42.952 --> 19:46.421
You took the money. You
knew he was undocumented.

19:46.423 --> 19:49.030
If you had thought for a
minute about his situation,

19:49.032 --> 19:50.325
you would have realized

19:50.327 --> 19:51.786
that you were putting him in danger.

19:51.788 --> 19:54.612
Do you think I like
not having Emilio here

19:54.614 --> 19:55.930
to help me with my baby?

19:55.932 --> 19:58.165
Then why don't you help him get back?

19:58.167 --> 19:59.767
How am I supposed to do that?

19:59.769 --> 20:02.150
Go to Mexico and marry him.

20:02.152 --> 20:04.008
At least then he'll have a chance

20:04.010 --> 20:06.173
to come back here in a year or two.

20:07.344 --> 20:09.310
I didn't know that was a possibility.

20:09.312 --> 20:10.777
- Hmm.
- You're white.

20:10.779 --> 20:13.179
Anything's a possibility.

20:15.951 --> 20:18.284
He would never pressure you,

20:18.286 --> 20:19.619
but we will.

20:20.622 --> 20:22.689
So, what are you going to do?

20:22.691 --> 20:23.790
Mm-hmm.

20:23.792 --> 20:26.159
Uh... hold on.

20:26.161 --> 20:27.861
I don't know.

20:27.863 --> 20:28.895
This is a lot.

20:28.897 --> 20:30.630
I'm gonna go.

20:30.632 --> 20:31.798
You need to work.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.467
We love the baby.

20:33.469 --> 20:35.034
Leave her here.

20:35.036 --> 20:37.337
You know we'll take good care of her.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.742
Okay.

20:42.778 --> 20:44.644
And just so you know,

20:44.646 --> 20:47.367
we would have never said
those hateful things about you

20:47.369 --> 20:49.448
if we thought you understood them.

20:53.426 --> 20:57.639
Hey. In honor of my new
job and my 30% discount,

20:57.641 --> 20:59.837
I say we all get a family tattoo.

20:59.839 --> 21:00.971
Yes!

21:00.973 --> 21:02.673
Something that represents who we are.

21:02.675 --> 21:04.874
Something that says "Conner".

21:04.876 --> 21:06.509
Here's a sinking ship.

21:06.511 --> 21:09.679
Doesn't get more Conner than that.

21:09.681 --> 21:12.615
The house on fire seems appropriate.

21:12.617 --> 21:15.818
A mushroom cloud kinda says "us".

21:15.820 --> 21:18.287
Hey, thank you so much
for finding me this job.

21:18.289 --> 21:21.277
Yeah, your grandfather thought
you needed more time off,

21:21.279 --> 21:22.919
but I knew you needed
to get back to work.
