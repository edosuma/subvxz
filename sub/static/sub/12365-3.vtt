[grunts]

00:29.572 --> 00:31.563
[camera shutter snapping]

01:17.870 --> 01:19.030
Whoa!

01:19.997 --> 01:21.737
Geez and rice, man.

01:21.958 --> 01:23.289
Just about gave me
a heart attack.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.332
That's good.
Who are you?

01:25.545 --> 01:27.410
My name's Bob Barnes.

01:27.630 --> 01:31.418
I, uh, working out here
for the forest service.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.590
We're surveying the whole county

01:33.803 --> 01:36.715
trying to eradicate
non-native species of weeds.

01:36.931 --> 01:41.721
As a Native myself, I appreciate
the spirit of your work.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.518
But as the owner
of this property,

01:44.730 --> 01:47.688
I'm gonna have to ask you
to stay off it.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.357
Of course, sir.
I meant no harm.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.311
Sorry to disturb you.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.372
You're positive this was
on Nighthorse's property?

02:05.585 --> 02:06.825
lam.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.035
That guy is intense.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.871
-You saw him?
-He kind of snuck up on me.

02:13.384 --> 02:15.466
You see anything else unusual
on the property?

02:15.678 --> 02:17.885
Yeah, near his garden.
He had this --

02:18.097 --> 02:20.839
this wooden stake stuck down
in the ground, and then it had,

02:21.058 --> 02:24.095
like, a long, thick,
leather strap attached to it.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.018
-What kind of garden?
-l'm not sure.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.313
There was nothing growing,
but the soil was freshly turned.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.140
I think he just planted it.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.697
Vic, you there?

02:38.909 --> 02:40.695
[Vic] Hey, Walt, I'm just
pulling up to the station.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.902
I need you to get
those warrants in order.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.202
[Vic]
Nighthorse?

02:44.415 --> 02:45.575
Yep.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.202
Thanks, Bob.

02:48.419 --> 02:50.205
It's me who should
be thanking you, Walt,

02:50.421 --> 02:51.661
for getting me this job.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.000
It's helping me
to get my footing.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.673
It's volunteer work, Bob.
Doesn't even pay.

02:56.844 --> 03:01.178
True, but it gives me structure,
a sense of responsibility.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.641
Self-respect.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.015
it's court ordered, so...

03:06.228 --> 03:07.889
[Ruby]
Walt, it's Ruby.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.936
How close are you to the
Sinclair station east of town?

03:10.149 --> 03:11.264
Not far.
What's up?

03:11.484 --> 03:12.815
[Ruby] A truckerjust called in

03:13.027 --> 03:14.608
a reckless driver
in a black SUV

03:14.820 --> 03:18.483
heading south on 232
and swerving pretty badly.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.314
Okay, I'll check it out.

03:26.749 --> 03:28.660
[tires squealing]

03:34.340 --> 03:36.205
[siren wailing]

03:47.186 --> 03:50.599
[horn honks]

03:50.815 --> 03:53.056
[tires screech, metal crunches]

04:07.373 --> 04:08.909
Leave me alone.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.707
[grunts]
You all right?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.455
Am I?

04:14.714 --> 04:16.170
I don't know.

04:16.382 --> 04:19.340
lcan't feel my -- anything.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.551
[Walt]
Come on, Barlow.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.095
Let's get you out of there.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.257
[grunts]

04:33.691 --> 04:36.433
-[grunts]
-Easy does it.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.645
Big step.

04:41.866 --> 04:43.982
I got you.
I got you.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.236
Who's got you?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.784
I'm not sure.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.203
You taking me to jail?

04:50.416 --> 04:52.532
Well, I ought to.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.788
l, uh, think maybe
you've been through enough,

04:55.004 --> 04:57.040
so I'll just take you home,
Barlow.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.336
Okay.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.707
Well, on the --

05:04.472 --> 05:07.259
Oh.
There you are.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.429
Come on.
Buckle up.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.601
l was buckled up.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.975
You de-buckled me.
Get out of the way.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.565
Okay, you do it.

05:18.778 --> 05:22.236
I've got it.
How's your head?

05:22.448 --> 05:24.689
I'm all right.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.991
[engine turns over]

05:27.203 --> 05:29.489
This doesn't look like
my seatbelt.

05:37.713 --> 05:41.672
[rock music plays]

05:41.884 --> 05:42.964
[Cadyl
All set?

05:43.177 --> 05:44.917
[Kevin]
Thank you. Great meal.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.886
[Cady] Um, l-l think there
must be a mistake.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.603
I don't think so.

05:53.813 --> 05:55.849
-The -- The tip is too big.
-Well, how much is it?

05:56.065 --> 05:57.521
It's $50,000.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.439
[chuckles]
Let me see that.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.105
Oh.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.823
I see what I did.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.988
It's not a tip.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.816
It's an offer.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.367
For what?

06:12.206 --> 06:14.367
My name's Kevin Morris.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.450
I work for a Boston-based
law firm called Dow & Morris,

06:17.670 --> 06:19.410
and we just opened an office
here in Durant.

06:19.630 --> 06:24.465
My job is to find and hire
the best lawyers in this state.

06:24.677 --> 06:25.917
Starting with you, "Caddy."

06:26.136 --> 06:28.878
Me? Why?

06:29.098 --> 06:31.009
Your work
on the Henry Standing Bear case.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.715
Word gets out.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.846
You're smart.
You're young.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.472
You know the community.

06:36.689 --> 06:39.180
And we'd much rather have you
arguing beside us

06:39.400 --> 06:40.731
than against us.

06:41.777 --> 06:42.892
You know...

06:45.739 --> 06:47.195
Think it over.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.898
Give me a call.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.327
[sighs]

06:54.540 --> 06:57.703
Mr. Morris, um, it's Cady.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.328
What?

06:59.545 --> 07:01.911
My name -- You
pronounced it wrong. It's Cady.

07:02.131 --> 07:03.120
C-a-d-y?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.671
[Cadyl
Yeah.

07:04.884 --> 07:06.374
I think
you're spelling it wrong.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.969
[sighs]

07:21.191 --> 07:22.476
Aw, shit.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.276
Left the keys in the damn car.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.446
You got a spare?
Or maybe there's
a window open here we can --

07:29.658 --> 07:31.819
[grunts]
[glass shatters, alarm blares]

07:33.203 --> 07:36.286
Sheriff, I want to report
a break-in.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.204
Yeah.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.212
I thought you
might want to sober up.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.387
Hm.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.184
Or maybe go the other way.

08:03.108 --> 08:06.441
Thanks, Walt.
You ought to join me.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.690
Go grab a glass.

08:08.906 --> 08:12.148
Well, I'm not
a whiskey man, so...

08:12.368 --> 08:16.281
Well, beer, then --
There's beer in the fridge.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.237
Any Rainier?

08:18.457 --> 08:21.244
No.
No Rainier.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.576
Just some imported shit.

08:23.796 --> 08:25.787
[chuckles]
I'll pass.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.837
[Barlow sighs]

08:29.468 --> 08:31.504
[sighs]

08:34.974 --> 08:37.716
You know, uh, Barlow, um...

08:39.019 --> 08:44.480
ldon't usually like to discuss
details of investigations,

08:44.692 --> 08:48.105
but, uh, there's something
I think you deserve to know.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.697
I don't think Branch
killed himself.

08:55.119 --> 08:56.825
What?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.698
He's not dead?

08:58.872 --> 09:02.364
I mean I have reason to believe
that someone murdered him.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.669
If somebody killed Branch,
got to be Nighthorse.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.592
Why do you say that?

09:13.804 --> 09:17.717
[Barlow] Well, he's been trying
to get at me

09:17.933 --> 09:20.140
in all sorts of ways.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.139
He planted those old Indian
bones on my golf course

09:23.355 --> 09:25.471
to try and stall my development.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.815
But I don't go down easy.

09:30.279 --> 09:33.863
When he saw he
couldn't get at me, he...

09:34.074 --> 09:36.781
went after the thing I loved.

09:40.164 --> 09:42.576
If someone went after
my daughter, I...

09:43.625 --> 09:45.581
I don't know what I'd do.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.409
-We got to get him.
-I will.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.415
|wi||.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.873
But I need to do it legally,
and you need to stay out of it.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.760
Now, are you gonna be okay
here on your own?

09:58.807 --> 10:00.889
You worried
I'm gonna shoot myself?

10:04.188 --> 10:07.055
Connallys aren't cowards, Walt.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.986
We don't kill ourselves.

10:18.202 --> 10:20.113
Where are the keys
to your other car?

10:20.329 --> 10:22.365
I don't want you driving,
not in your state of mind.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.162
You're grounded
as far as I'm concerned.

10:24.374 --> 10:27.241
Oh, they're, uh,
in the other room in a desk.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.372
-I can -- Oh.
-Come on. Take it easy.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.499
Just -- Right there.
Take a seat.

10:31.715 --> 10:35.799
Okay, they're in there.
[sighs]

10:36.011 --> 10:39.094
-Here you go.
-You're the sheriff.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.139
[sighs] Ooh.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.024
Mm.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.156
Arrowleaf balsamroot.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.579
Thafs
those sunflower-looking things?

11:05.791 --> 11:06.746
[Walt]
They are.

11:06.959 --> 11:10.702
[clears throat]
Well...

11:10.921 --> 11:12.411
for a man of few words, Walt,

11:12.631 --> 11:15.418
this is
one long warrant application.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.295
I wanted to be as thorough
as possible.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.752
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'll tell you what.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.587
I'm gonna give you
a search warrant.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.138
Thank you, Your Honor.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.466
But not for
Jacob Nighthorse's property.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.472
I'll give you a warrant
for my home,

11:27.688 --> 11:31.431
because those sunflowers grow
like weeds along the driveway.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.641
In fact, they grow
practically everywhere.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.227
Not along the river
where we found Branch's body.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.734
Well, that may well be,
but that's not evidence enough

11:39.950 --> 11:42.236
to cast suspicion
on Jacob Nighthorse.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.158
You mean Jacob Blankenship.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.407
Ah, I almost forgot.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.330
The mysterious
legal-name change.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.534
It speaks to a pattern
of deceit.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.618
[chuckles]
It speaks to an Indian wanting

11:53.839 --> 11:56.672
to sound a little more like
an Indian.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.465
Look, you clearly have

11:58.677 --> 12:01.134
a significant bug up your ass
about this, Walt,

12:01.346 --> 12:03.428
but I can't let you
disturb a citizen

12:03.640 --> 12:05.380
based on this thin evidence,

12:05.601 --> 12:09.344
particularly since you've played
so fast and loose with protocol.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.019
I mean, for all I know,

12:11.231 --> 12:13.313
you could've put that dirt
in the shotgun casing.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.766
I fully documented the chain
of custody.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.102
When you deputized
your best friend,

12:18.322 --> 12:21.860
the recently released prisoner,
to transport the evidence.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.326
We're shorthanded, Your Honor.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.400
[Mayhew]
Well, then hire a new deputy.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.703
But your request
for a search warrant

12:27.915 --> 12:30.782
on Jacob Nighthorse's property
is denied.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.960
Walt.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.662
Not in the mood
to talk now, Vic.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.589
Well, that's nothing new,
but you don't have to talk.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.962
We can, like,
go get a burger or something.

12:42.179 --> 12:43.965
I need you to look into
Nighthorse's alibi

12:44.181 --> 12:46.388
for the window of time
around when Branch was killed.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.056
You are his alibi.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.724
You're the one that told me
that he was out of town.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.518
I saw him get off a plane.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.936
How do I know he was
where he said he was?

12:53.148 --> 12:54.137
Could've been an act.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.223
Check his flight details.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.934
Have Ferg
look into his credit cards.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.610
Okay.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.531
Anything else?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.654
The burger --
Thanks, but not tonight.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.199
[engine turns over]

13:10.415 --> 13:12.747
[engine revs, tires squeal]

13:22.594 --> 13:24.425
[Catherine] This is
a confidentiality agreement.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.254
It says that you can't disclose
the firm's trade secrets,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.135
client list, et cetera.

13:29.351 --> 13:32.593
Go ahead and sign here
and initial there.

13:33.855 --> 13:37.222
Okay. Before Ms. Longmire
gets bored and changes her mind,

13:37.442 --> 13:40.184
I thought she might be curious
about her compensation package.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.894
So...

13:44.825 --> 13:46.531
That's not the salary
we discussed.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.074
We haven't talked about salary.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.618
You said $50,000.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.320
That was your year-one bonus,

13:51.540 --> 13:52.996
assuming you meet
certain benchmarks.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.915
We wouldn't expect you
to live on that salary.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.589
-Is -- Is there a problem?
-[Cady chuckles]

14:04.177 --> 14:05.337
No.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.919
No, there's no problem.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.130
Would you like to review
your health-plan options?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.556
Yes, I would like that
very much.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.231
Good morning, Ruby.
How are you today?

14:19.443 --> 14:20.853
Mathias, why don't you
take a seat?

14:21.069 --> 14:22.400
I'll tell the sheriff
that you're here.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.398
That's okay.
I want to surprise him.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.196
Oh, I like what you've done
with your hair, Philly.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.192
Sheriff.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.158
I need to see your guns.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.583
[Walt] What? My guns?
What for?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.911
Oh, what does it matter?
You haven't done anything wrong.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.746
So, just let me take a look
at them.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.252
-You got a warrant?
-Nope.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.256
And you know I couldn't get one
even if I wanted to.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.928
Why would you want to,

14:50.140 --> 14:52.552
except for the simple pleasure
of annoying me?

14:52.768 --> 14:54.759
Someone fired off
two .30-caliber rounds

14:54.978 --> 14:56.309
at Jacob Nighthorse last night.

14:57.939 --> 14:58.974
Where?

15:00.359 --> 15:02.941
Right there at his home.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.109
Nighthorse doesn't live
on the Res.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.983
What's this got to do with you?

15:07.199 --> 15:09.315
Wondered the same thing
when Nighthorse called me

15:09.534 --> 15:12.697
since I have no authority
in your county.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.405
Did you really accuse Nighthorse
of killing Branch?

15:16.625 --> 15:18.456
Then you could understand why

15:18.668 --> 15:20.875
he didn't feel too comfortable
about calling you in.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.039
I didn't shoot at anybody
last night, Mathias.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.465
Great.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.884
Then let me check out
all your guns.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.095
No.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.094
[sighs]

15:35.310 --> 15:36.720
Okay.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.643
Well, I tried.

15:38.855 --> 15:42.894
There's nothing else I can do,
then, except call in the feds.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.697
[man]
Mr. Nighthorse!

15:50.909 --> 15:52.024
[reporters speaking
indistinctly]

15:52.244 --> 15:54.610
The bullet
went right by my head.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.661
Missed me by less than two feet.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.374
[camera shutter snaps]

15:58.583 --> 16:01.165
Now, coming, as this did,

16:01.378 --> 16:03.164
on the heels
of repeated harassment

16:03.380 --> 16:04.290
by Sheriff Longmire,

16:04.506 --> 16:05.871
it's pretty clear to me

16:06.091 --> 16:08.207
that the sheriff was behind
the shooting.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.801
Walt Longmire has tried
to connect me to several crimes

16:12.013 --> 16:14.174
that I had nothing to do with.

16:14.391 --> 16:17.883
So, I'm hopeful that,
by shining a light

16:18.103 --> 16:22.267
on the activities
of his backward, corrupt,

16:22.482 --> 16:25.224
and prejudiced
Sheriff's Department,

16:25.444 --> 16:28.231
we may be able to rein in
the worst of their excesses.

16:28.447 --> 16:31.530
But -- But barring that,
[just want to say right now...

16:31.741 --> 16:34.153
[telephone ringing]
...ifI end up dead

16:34.327 --> 16:36.158
in the coming days or weeks,

16:36.371 --> 16:40.159
the first person you
should look at is your sheriff.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.034
Sheriff's Department.
This is Deputy Ferguson.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.085
[Henry] Hello, Ferg.
This is Henry.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.084
[Ferg] Hey, Henry, you want me
to get the sheriff for you?

16:48.300 --> 16:49.631
[Henry]
Maybe.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.505
Depends on how you answer
a question for me.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.965
Do you know
where he was last night?

16:55.182 --> 16:56.763
[sighs]

16:56.975 --> 17:01.093
l was off duty, so, no,
I don't know where Walt was.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.019
Hello?

17:07.235 --> 17:08.975
Is he gone?

17:09.196 --> 17:11.107
-Who?
-Mathias.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.238
Yeah.
He's gone.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.987
[Vic]
Good.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.115
I don't want to have to answer
any of his questions.

17:19.331 --> 17:20.867
ldon't want him to ask me
where you've been

17:21.041 --> 17:22.326
or where you were last night

17:22.542 --> 17:24.453
or when the last time
I saw you was.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.045
Why not?

17:26.254 --> 17:27.790
Because I don't want
to have to lie for you.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.462
-Vic, listen --
-No.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.289
I don't want you to have to lie
to me, either.

17:31.510 --> 17:32.920
Look, I get it --

17:33.136 --> 17:34.717
It sucks that Nighthorse
is getting away with this,

17:34.930 --> 17:36.295
and it's actually
kind of brilliant

17:36.515 --> 17:37.550
because you shoot at him,

17:37.724 --> 17:39.055
and now his house
is a crime scene

17:39.267 --> 17:40.177
and you don't need
a search warrant anymore,

17:40.393 --> 17:41.974
but, Jesus, Walt!

17:42.187 --> 17:44.348
He has got great lawyers.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.145
And now Mathias
is calling in the feds.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.144
You might've blown your only
chance you had to get him,

17:48.360 --> 17:50.146
and you might even lose
yourjob.

17:51.196 --> 17:54.108
I know that you have a
.30-caliber rifle, and I just --

17:54.324 --> 17:56.406
I cannot get in the middle

17:56.618 --> 17:57.573
of one of these situations
again.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.733
-Vic.
-Not even for you.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.114
-Listen to me.
-What?!

18:00.330 --> 18:02.912
I will never ask you
to lie for me.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.120
I know you can't verify
where l was last night.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.451
No one can.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.207
[sighs]

18:09.422 --> 18:13.290
I need you to take a breath
and go find Bob Barnes.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.966
Bob? Why?

18:15.178 --> 18:17.043
Because what you just said
about Nighthorse's house,

18:17.264 --> 18:18.424
you're right.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.346
We have a way in now.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.720
And Bob knows where we
need to look.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.636
[sighs]

18:26.856 --> 18:28.107
Vic.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.227
Come on,
we got to get over there

18:30.443 --> 18:31.649
before Nighthorse's lawyers
or the feds

18:31.861 --> 18:33.442
find some way to stop us.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.630
What are you doing here?

18:54.843 --> 18:56.174
My job.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.251
Aah!

18:58.471 --> 18:59.972
Mathias reported a crime.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.717
I'm out here to investigate it.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.891
I reported that crime
to Mathias, not you.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.934
He doesn't have any authority
off the Res.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.933
Then I withdraw my report.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.356
Nothing happened here,
and you can be on your way.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.775
Well, someone's, uh,
taking shots

19:13.987 --> 19:15.318
at residents in my county.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.861
-That's a public-safety issue.
-Aw, please!

19:17.073 --> 19:19.530
I don't care if you file
a report or not.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.529
I'm compelled to investigate.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.657
You and I both know
you did this.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.238
Actually, based on how quickly

19:26.458 --> 19:27.948
you pulled
that press conference together,

19:28.168 --> 19:30.033
I'm inclined to think
maybe you did this.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.369
-I shot at myself?
-Sure you did.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.170
Create a false pretense

19:34.382 --> 19:36.247
which allows you
to harass me in the media.

19:36.468 --> 19:39.335
"A false pretense
which allows you to harass me."

19:39.512 --> 19:41.673
That is a perfect turn
of phrase.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.381
I'm gonna pass that along
to my lawyer right now.

19:48.563 --> 19:49.894
Is he in your truck?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.640
Yeah, it's Jacob.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.020
You'll never guess
who just showed up

19:55.236 --> 19:56.396
to search my prOperty --

19:56.613 --> 19:58.103
without a warrant!

20:07.040 --> 20:08.405
Hey.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.411
Show me where you spotted
the arrowleaf balsamroot

20:10.627 --> 20:11.833
and that new flower bed.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.661
Bob?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.712
You never said anything
about people getting shot at.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.335
What?

20:18.551 --> 20:19.882
I thought you got me this job
to help me out.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.676
I didn't know
you were gonna put me in danger.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.879
-You weren't in any danger.
-Oh, come on, Walt.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.134
Why didn't you come out here

20:25.350 --> 20:26.760
and look for that flower
yourself?

20:26.976 --> 20:29.433
I'm not exactly welcome
on Nighthorse's property.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.012
So you send me out here
to trespass for you?

20:32.232 --> 20:33.472
You're not trespassing,

20:33.692 --> 20:35.102
and I would never send you
into danger.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.229
I honestly had no idea

20:37.445 --> 20:40.107
anyone was gonna be firing
a weapon out here.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.359
Now can you please show me
where you saw that flower?

20:42.575 --> 20:45.908
How's about I just point it out
through the window for you?

20:46.121 --> 20:47.531
Fine.

20:52.627 --> 20:55.118
Get photos of everything here.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.669
I want a match on the location

20:56.881 --> 20:59.133
of every one of these flowers
on the property,

20:59.342 --> 21:01.333
then get some soil samples.

21:01.553 --> 21:03.214
What exactly are we looking for,
Sheriff?

21:03.430 --> 21:06.297
Shotgun shells, buckshot,
traces of blood,

21:06.516 --> 21:07.926
anything that proves
this is the real place

21:08.143 --> 21:09.178
where Branch got killed.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.977
You think he was shot here?

21:13.189 --> 21:15.566
Won't know for sure
till you get some samples.

21:20.238 --> 21:21.853
All the documents
our client has

21:22.073 --> 21:23.279
in connection
with this pending suit

21:23.491 --> 21:24.901
are on these drives.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.200
I'm gonna be prepping motions
for discovery.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.993
I need you all to backstop me.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.742
Cady.
We're lawyers.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.040
We don't raise our hand.
We interrupt.

21:34.252 --> 21:35.753
Right, sorry.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.328
It's just that we represent
Connally Enterprises?

21:38.548 --> 21:40.584
No, we're suing
Connally Enterprises --

21:40.800 --> 21:42.916
Barlow Connally specifically.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.467
Do you know him?

21:44.679 --> 21:48.297
l, um, I used to date
his son, so...

21:48.516 --> 21:50.131
[Kevin]
Great.

21:50.351 --> 21:52.182
You should be able to offer
some real insight into this.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.514
I just feel a little weird.

21:57.734 --> 21:58.894
Cady.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.816
-Yeah.
-We're filing motions.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.735
It's not like you'll be facing
off against Barlow in court.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.107
Oh.
Good.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.064
And besides,
if you recuse yourself

22:06.284 --> 22:07.820
from every case
in Absaroka County

22:07.994 --> 22:09.359
where you know someone
on the other side,

22:09.579 --> 22:11.991
you won't be able
to practice law at all.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.448
This is life in a small town.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.578
All right, next.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.417
Whoever fired that shot
must've been in this area, so...

22:22.634 --> 22:24.170
[Vic]
Hmm.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.512
It's almost like
you know exactly where to go.

22:28.723 --> 22:31.681
There aren't too many spots
it could've been.

22:31.893 --> 22:35.226
Nighthorse would want to suggest
the shooter needed cover.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.474
If it wasn't Nighthorse,

22:37.690 --> 22:40.147
the highway's
a few hundred yards to the east.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.396
Someone could've walked in
from there.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.027
There's horse shit
all over the place.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.733
Maybe the shooter rode in.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.410
Nighthorse got a horse?

22:52.622 --> 22:54.158
lthink so.

23:58.855 --> 24:02.188
Just do what I said
and call me back in an hour.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.355
Okay.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.939
Yeah, bye.

24:07.989 --> 24:10.275
The company suing Barlow
is Big Pines Timber.

24:10.491 --> 24:11.822
[Kevin]
Yes.

24:12.035 --> 24:13.946
Big Pines Timber is owned
by Jacob Nighthorse.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.653
Yes, we represent
all of Nighthorse's businesses.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.286
-You look confused.
-I am.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.951
The document
that I just read said

24:23.171 --> 24:24.752
that Nighthorse
is suing Barlow Connally

24:24.964 --> 24:27.250
for breach of contract,
but those two are sworn enemies.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.708
What contract could they
possibly have?

24:29.928 --> 24:31.259
They may not like each other,

24:31.471 --> 24:33.007
but they have
a number of business deals

24:33.222 --> 24:34.598
through shell corporations --
or they did have.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.422
This lawsuit might bring that
to a close.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.062
I quit.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.320
What?
Why?

24:51.491 --> 24:53.106
B-Because of Barlow Connally?

24:53.326 --> 24:55.487
Look, I told you,
you're just support on this.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.785
All right, look, if you're
really that uncomfortable --

24:57.997 --> 24:59.658
I am, but not because
of Connally.

24:59.832 --> 25:03.074
Because of Nighthorse
and the casino.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.501
I can't work for a firm
that represents the casino.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.965
[chuckles]

25:08.174 --> 25:09.710
What's so funny?

25:09.926 --> 25:12.508
Only that the casino
is the reason you're here.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.711
Your success
on the Standing Bear case,

25:14.931 --> 25:16.592
y-your connections
to the Native community,

25:16.808 --> 25:18.423
your support of their causes --

25:18.643 --> 25:21.555
You are the perfect person
to handle reservation issues.

25:21.771 --> 25:24.137
That's true -- to a point.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.188
I mean, you have to understand,

25:26.401 --> 25:29.564
my mother, she spent
her last years on this planet

25:29.779 --> 25:31.064
fighting the casino,

25:31.280 --> 25:32.861
and for me to stay here
and work for them,

25:33.074 --> 25:35.531
it's a betrayal,
and I'm -- I'm sorry.

25:35.743 --> 25:38.906
I-I can't do it, so...
-Well.

25:39.122 --> 25:41.158
Well, this is, uh...

25:42.583 --> 25:43.993
...unexpected.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.327
I know.
I'm so grateful.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.003
l was really excited
about this job.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.752
-If you'd just told me --
-|t's your responsibility

25:51.968 --> 25:54.630
to research a company
you plan to work for.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.133
Right.

25:58.349 --> 25:59.634
I must've just gotten excited.

25:59.851 --> 26:01.432
Anyway, I'm really sorry
I wasted your time.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.225
And our money.

26:03.438 --> 26:05.554
These were valuable, billable
hours you put in today.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.274
I realize that.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.939
Then, why haven't you packed
your stuff and left,

26:09.152 --> 26:10.892
or are you trying
to waste more of our money?

26:12.030 --> 26:13.986
-Okay.
-Not the pad.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.189
That belongs to us.

26:16.409 --> 26:17.444
This is mine.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.321
[chuckles]

26:19.537 --> 26:21.869
Normally,
I wouldn't think it necessary

26:22.081 --> 26:23.946
to remind another lawyer
about this,

26:24.167 --> 26:27.034
but clearly you're
a little green, so I will.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.710
Everything that you read
and wrote in here today

26:29.922 --> 26:31.913
belongs to us.

26:32.133 --> 26:33.498
You signed
nondisclosure agreements

26:33.718 --> 26:35.254
that couldn't be clearer
on that matter.

26:35.470 --> 26:38.007
So, you cannot take your notes
and you cannot discuss

26:38.222 --> 26:41.714
anything you learned
in here today with anyone.

26:43.519 --> 26:47.728
So, if this whole act of yours
was designed to get you access

26:47.940 --> 26:49.601
to private information
about the casino

26:49.817 --> 26:52.809
your mommy didn't like,

26:53.029 --> 26:55.111
know that we will prosecute you,

26:55.323 --> 26:59.282
and it is very hard
to defend a civil lawsuit

26:59.494 --> 27:02.076
on a waitress' salary.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.660
You can close the door
behind you.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.133
Henry's friend from
the university rushed the tests

27:21.349 --> 27:23.761
on those soil samples
from Nighthorse's house.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.389
None of them matched the dirt
we found in the shotgun casing.

27:27.605 --> 27:30.187
It's a totally different
mineral composition.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.983
And no traces of blood, lead,
or gunpowder.

27:35.363 --> 27:39.902
The only thing that was the same
was arrowleaf balsamroot pollen.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.614
at the White Plains airport
in New York.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.037
So, Nighthorse did land there
the night of Branch's murder,

27:46.249 --> 27:49.161
and he took a helicopter
out to the Foxwoods Casino.

27:49.377 --> 27:50.537
They're sending me
the security footage now

27:50.753 --> 27:51.993
to verify that.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.168
So, Nighthorse has a better
alibi for Branch's murder

27:56.384 --> 27:58.375
than I do for shooting
at Nighthorse.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.051
-[chuckles]
-[clears throat]

28:01.264 --> 28:02.754
Too soon?

28:04.392 --> 28:08.180
Okay, so, uh, he has an alibi.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.140
Doesn't Nighthorse
usually get someone else

28:10.356 --> 28:11.687
to do his dirty work?

28:11.899 --> 28:13.560
Yeah, he does,
but David Ridges is dead,

28:13.776 --> 28:16.518
and according to Henry,
Malachi's out of town.

28:16.737 --> 28:18.602
[Ferg]
Hey,SherHﬁ

28:18.823 --> 28:20.905
Uh, while we're on the subject,

28:21.117 --> 28:23.108
I've been wondering
about something --

28:23.327 --> 28:24.737
about those surveillance cameras

28:24.954 --> 28:27.445
that you think were stolen
from Branch's house.

28:27.665 --> 28:32.375
Why would Nighthorse take them?
I mean --

28:32.587 --> 28:33.918
-You're thinking Nighthorse
was the one

28:34.130 --> 28:36.166
who brought them to us
in the first place.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.622
Right, if he thought
those cameras

28:37.842 --> 28:39.548
had incriminating video on them,

28:39.760 --> 28:41.967
why would he
willingly turn them over?

28:42.180 --> 28:44.136
-It just doesn't make any sense.
-I know.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.430
I know it doesn't make
any sense, Ferg.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.553
-Don't raise your voice
at him Walter.

28:48.769 --> 28:49.849
-|t's okay.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.220
Here you go.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.977
[sighs]
What does Barlow want?

28:56.194 --> 28:59.061
He left his phone
in his wrecked SUV.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.818
You never filed any paperwork
about a wrecked SUV,

29:03.034 --> 29:04.945
so I didn't know
what he was talking about.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.992
I can get that phone for him.

29:07.205 --> 29:08.786
Anything else?

29:08.998 --> 29:10.613
They're on hold.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.415
[clears throat]

29:18.507 --> 29:20.418
-Tell them I'm not here.
-Walter.

29:20.635 --> 29:22.921
[Vic]
Ruby.

29:23.137 --> 29:24.798
Who's on hold?
[door closes]

29:32.355 --> 29:34.016
-Hey, honey.
-Hi.

29:34.232 --> 29:36.188
[Vic] Hey.
You just missed your dad.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.062
Good. Actually, I, uh,
kind of wanted to talk to you.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.313
-Me?
-Yeah.

29:40.529 --> 29:41.484
Really? Why?

29:41.697 --> 29:43.858
I need some professional advice.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.190
From me?

29:45.409 --> 29:46.660
Have you ever been working
on a case

29:46.869 --> 29:47.984
and you got good information,

29:48.204 --> 29:49.364
but the way you got
that information

29:49.580 --> 29:51.445
wasn't exactly legal?

29:51.666 --> 29:54.624
[sighs] This wouldn't happen
to have anything to do

29:54.835 --> 29:55.915
with your dad, would it?

29:56.128 --> 29:57.709
It might.

29:57.922 --> 30:00.083
Well, you're gonna have to
tell me what this is about.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.881
See, that's the problem.
l-l can't.

30:04.262 --> 30:05.968
Then, I can't help you.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.636
lcan't help anyone
break the law.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.804
[Cady]
I'm trying not to break the law.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.175
[sighs]
Look --

30:14.397 --> 30:17.889
All I can say is that I
may have found something

30:18.109 --> 30:20.316
that would give Nighthorse
motive in Branch's murder.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.856
I think he was caught
between two people.

30:24.073 --> 30:26.029
What two people?
Do we know them?

30:26.242 --> 30:28.198
Okay, now I feel like
you're not really hearing me.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.571
Right, you can't tell me.

30:29.787 --> 30:31.402
I signed
a confidentiality agreement,

30:31.622 --> 30:34.455
so anything that I say to anyone
can get thrown out in court,

30:34.667 --> 30:36.874
and I know my dad
wants to do this by the book,

30:37.086 --> 30:39.042
so what do I do?

30:39.255 --> 30:40.665
You find another source.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.042
I mean, you know
the information already.

30:43.259 --> 30:45.215
You just need to find
a different way to get it.

30:45.428 --> 30:48.465
A different way
that you can explain to a lawyer

30:48.681 --> 30:49.670
that doesn't violate

30:49.890 --> 30:51.096
whatever
confidentiality agreement

30:51.309 --> 30:52.549
you may have signed.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.272
Can you find another source?

31:00.609 --> 31:02.270
[rock music plays]

31:02.486 --> 31:04.863
[Henry]
So, this is a bit on the nose.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.901
-What?
-A cop drowning his troubles

31:08.117 --> 31:10.278
and pouring out his soul
to the local tavern keeper.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.280
Yeah.

31:12.955 --> 31:17.665
Except you're not really
the local tavern keeper here.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.617
Malachi is.

31:19.837 --> 31:21.043
Also, you are not pouring out
yoursouL

31:21.255 --> 31:22.665
and you are not drinking.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.544
I need a new boot.

31:33.142 --> 31:35.599
This is why you are upset?
Your boots are not comfortable?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.605
When I was 8 or 9 years old,
my...

31:43.361 --> 31:46.899
...my mom got me some boots --
nice ones.

31:47.114 --> 31:48.650
I loved them.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.982
Six months in,
my feet had grown.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.489
My toes hurt.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.036
Actually had bruises on them.

31:58.709 --> 32:01.371
I kept wearing those boots.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.953
You never were
the brightest child.

32:08.636 --> 32:10.172
I'm doing it again.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.800
With Nighthorse.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.224
None of the evidence fits.

32:19.230 --> 32:22.097
Nothing says he killed Branch
except my gut.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.025
I want to believe it.

32:29.407 --> 32:32.114
-At a certain point --
-Your feet start to hurt.

32:34.370 --> 32:37.282
So, if it was not Nighthorse
who killed Branch,

32:37.498 --> 32:39.910
who else could it be?

32:40.126 --> 32:41.957
And if the murder
was not connected to Ridges,

32:42.169 --> 32:43.579
what was it about?

32:46.841 --> 32:48.832
I have absolutely no idea.

33:00.646 --> 33:01.601
[Barlow]
Hello, there.

33:01.814 --> 33:05.181
[sighs]
Surprised me.

33:05.401 --> 33:06.766
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.773
-I was out back shoeing a horse.
-Oh.

33:09.989 --> 33:12.321
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.489
Ah, good to see you, hon.

33:16.871 --> 33:17.986
-What happened?
-Oh, that.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.991
I had a little fender bender.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.743
Your dad actually helped me out
with it.

33:21.959 --> 33:24.871
-Do you want to come on inside?
-Yeah.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.587
Want a cup of coffee
or anything? It's right here.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.505
No, I'm -- I'm good.
Thank you.

33:31.886 --> 33:36.676
[Barlow] So...
what brings you around, Cady?

33:36.891 --> 33:40.133
Oh, um, I found some things
I thought you might like.

33:42.229 --> 33:46.188
A picture and just some things
that Branch left at my house --

33:46.400 --> 33:48.231
nothing special.

33:48.444 --> 33:51.607
A mug, golf gloves.

33:52.490 --> 33:54.276
Nothing, really.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.533
I appreciate it.

34:00.539 --> 34:04.748
But I'm pretty sure he'd want
you to hang on to this stuff.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.949
Okay.

34:08.172 --> 34:09.662
Are you sure?

34:09.882 --> 34:12.589
You meant so much to him.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.845
Yeah.

34:21.644 --> 34:24.511
So, how are you holding up?

34:24.730 --> 34:27.767
[chuckles] I wish I could say
l was keeping it together,

34:27.983 --> 34:30.690
but it hasn't been easy.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.734
You must really miss him.

34:33.656 --> 34:37.023
Especially since Branch
just started working with you.

34:38.619 --> 34:42.077
Must've been nice to have him
right there beside you.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.371
Yeah, it was
kind of a dream come true.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.698
I bet.

34:47.753 --> 34:51.291
What was he doing for you
anyway, work-wise?

34:55.928 --> 34:58.135
lwould've thought
he'd told you that.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.594
To be honest, Branch and l

35:03.811 --> 35:05.221
hadn't really been
communicating.

35:06.355 --> 35:08.721
We broke up
a month before he died.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.523
Oh.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.737
I didn't realize.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.234
Yeah.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.411
So, you and Branch
weren't together?

35:25.124 --> 35:26.830
No.

35:28.836 --> 35:31.293
l-l'm sorry I didn't tell you
at the funeral.

35:31.505 --> 35:34.872
It just didn't seem like
the time.

35:35.092 --> 35:36.593
And it's not exactly true

35:36.802 --> 35:38.633
that there wasn't
any communication between us.

35:38.846 --> 35:43.055
He sent me a bunch of texts
the night before Dad found him.

35:45.269 --> 35:46.634
But...

35:49.773 --> 35:50.933
But what?

35:52.234 --> 35:54.020
[Cadyl
I don't know.

35:55.404 --> 35:58.191
They -- You know,
the texts were kind of crazy.

36:02.620 --> 36:06.579
Yeah, he -- he sent me
some texts, too.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.872
I just figured he'd been
drinking.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.783
So I didn't do anything.

36:14.256 --> 36:16.338
-If only --
-Barlow.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.131
If you've spoken to my dad,

36:18.344 --> 36:20.801
you know that Branch
did not commit suicide.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.889
There's nothing
you could've done.

36:27.311 --> 36:29.051
Well, maybe he
didn't kill himself,

36:29.271 --> 36:31.808
but I still think
I could've stopped him.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.434
Stopped him from doing what?

36:38.822 --> 36:41.859
I think Branch got himself
all worked up, emotional,

36:42.076 --> 36:43.862
and confronted Nighthorse.

36:44.078 --> 36:47.741
Why? I mean, what would Branch
know about Nighthorse?

36:50.167 --> 36:52.078
I don't know.

36:52.294 --> 36:55.377
Probably something about
this David Ridges business.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.549
Well, it's... probably
not any comfort,

37:00.761 --> 37:04.925
but now that my dad knows
that he didn't commit suicide,

37:05.140 --> 37:08.507
he won't rest
until he figures it out.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.228
[Walt] Aah!

37:33.085 --> 37:36.202
Ruby said you'd be here --
dodging the feds.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.662
[sighs]

37:39.133 --> 37:41.795
I was just getting Barlow
his phone back.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.296
Really just a one-person job,
so...

37:44.513 --> 37:47.425
Yeah, well,
I needed to talk to you, so...

37:47.641 --> 37:49.597
Cady came by.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.846
She said that she found out
something about Nighthorse

37:52.062 --> 37:54.348
that would explain
why he'd want to kill Branch,

37:54.565 --> 37:57.602
but she can't reveal it
without breaking the law, so...

38:00.279 --> 38:01.564
lam just gonna ask you --

38:01.780 --> 38:03.316
Did you find out something
about Nighthorse

38:03.532 --> 38:05.113
when you shot at him
and you're making your daughter

38:05.325 --> 38:06.656
launder the information
for you?

38:06.869 --> 38:08.530
-Vic, listen to me --
-Before you deny it,

38:08.746 --> 38:13.410
I found this on the hill
at Nighthorse's house.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.206
It was on the ground

38:15.419 --> 38:17.455
right around where the shooter
would've been standing.

38:27.765 --> 38:30.677
I w-will lie for you.

38:30.893 --> 38:32.429
It's what I came here
to tell you.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.602
I'll say whatever
you want me to say.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.930
| just need you to tell me
what the hell's going on.

38:41.570 --> 38:43.310
I told you already.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.945
I will never ask you
to lie for me.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.449
The last person to accuse me

38:49.661 --> 38:51.492
with an empty beer can
was Branch.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.073
He was wrong then
just like you're wrong now.

38:57.377 --> 39:00.460
I was at home that night.
That's the truth.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.832
Why wouldn't you
just tell me that?

39:02.049 --> 39:04.631
Because you
weren't ready to listen.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.630
Everything I said
would've seemed like a lie.

39:14.812 --> 39:17.224
Well, if that's the case, then

39:17.439 --> 39:20.351
someone left that can there
to frame you,

39:20.567 --> 39:22.398
someone who knows
that you drink Rainier.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.192
Yep.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.565
[bang]

39:26.782 --> 39:29.148
So, what did Cady discover?

39:29.952 --> 39:33.695
[sighs] That Branch was caught
between two people.

39:33.914 --> 39:35.870
What two people?

39:36.083 --> 39:37.948
She refused to tell me.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.957
So, tell me
what you found out about Branch.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.132
Wow.

39:48.345 --> 39:49.630
Thanks, Vic.

39:49.847 --> 39:51.508
Some secrets you don't keep.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.679
-This one I have to.
-Why?

39:53.892 --> 39:56.178
-Who are you protecting?
-Myself.

39:56.395 --> 39:59.478
Dad, I signed
a confidentiality agreement.

39:59.690 --> 40:02.807
I got a job at a new law firm.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.061
-You got a job?
-Yeah.

40:04.278 --> 40:06.314
-That's great.
-It is great.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.566
It's the best job
I'll ever find in this county,

40:08.782 --> 40:10.568
and I already quit.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.243
I had to.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.067
The firm wasn't what
I thought it was.

40:14.288 --> 40:16.244
l-l didn't like
who they represented.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.321
They represent Nighthorse.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.874
[laughs]
I can't say.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.247
Anything that I say to you,

40:23.463 --> 40:25.249
they'll presume that
I'm violating my agreement,

40:25.465 --> 40:26.716
and they will sue me.

40:27.426 --> 40:29.132
And you found something.

40:29.344 --> 40:30.845
Maybe.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.794
I tried to get the information
a different way

40:33.015 --> 40:34.971
so that I wasn't violating
my agreement.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.559
How'd you do that?

40:38.312 --> 40:39.927
I went to talk to Barlow.

40:40.147 --> 40:41.978
What did you think
you were gonna get from Barlow?

40:42.190 --> 40:44.476
Dad, please don't make me
do the wrong thing here.

40:44.693 --> 40:46.149
Why does everybody keep saying

40:46.361 --> 40:47.692
I'm trying to make them do
the wrong thing?

40:47.905 --> 40:49.486
Because I know how much this
means to you.

40:51.867 --> 40:53.778
It means a lot to me, too.

40:53.994 --> 40:57.111
Cady, what did you and Barlow
talk about?

40:57.331 --> 40:59.287
You can tell me that.

41:03.045 --> 41:05.377
We talked about his car accident

41:05.589 --> 41:07.204
and about the crazy texts

41:07.424 --> 41:10.257
that Branch sent both of us
the night before he died.

41:10.469 --> 41:12.209
We talked about David Ridges,

41:12.429 --> 41:14.715
and I came clean about the fact
that Branch and I broke up.

41:14.932 --> 41:16.468
And we talked about everything

41:16.683 --> 41:18.890
except the thing
I wanted to talk about.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.356
So...

41:25.108 --> 41:27.645
Branch sent all those texts
to Barlow, too?

41:27.861 --> 41:29.067
Yeah.

41:29.279 --> 41:30.985
He said he thought Branch
had been drinking

41:31.198 --> 41:32.654
and went after Nighthorse.

41:39.790 --> 41:41.200
[scoffs]

41:47.047 --> 41:49.003
[knock on door]
[Walt] Barlow.

41:59.476 --> 42:00.716
Barlow?

42:05.190 --> 42:06.555
Hello?

42:37.639 --> 42:39.345
[sighs]

43:31.902 --> 43:33.642
[spits]

44:20.742 --> 44:21.948
[engine shuts off]

44:37.008 --> 44:39.215
[boards creak]

44:39.427 --> 44:41.338
[horse snorts]

44:55.110 --> 44:56.566
[rifle cocks]

45:10.041 --> 45:11.997
[piano notes play]

45:12.210 --> 45:13.871
[hinges creak]
[Barlow] Door was open.

45:15.088 --> 45:17.500
You really ought to keep it
locked, even out here.

45:17.716 --> 45:20.128
[rifle clicks]

45:22.804 --> 45:24.305
I could've shot you, Barlow.

45:24.514 --> 45:26.755
Nah, you got good instincts,
Walt.

45:26.975 --> 45:29.762
I had no idea you played piano.

45:29.978 --> 45:33.311
Well, I don't play it much
anymore, so...

45:34.983 --> 45:36.598
You rode over?

45:36.818 --> 45:39.776
Well, you took my keys.
[chuckles]

45:41.239 --> 45:42.399
Your horse need water?

45:42.616 --> 45:44.356
[Barlow]
No, she's fine.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.157
How about you?

45:46.369 --> 45:48.621
You twist my arm,
I'll take a bourbon.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.334
[Walt sighs]

45:55.170 --> 45:57.161
[sighs]

45:59.549 --> 46:02.256
So, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

46:03.929 --> 46:06.671
[Barlow] Well, I'm not sure
it's gonna be a pleasure.

46:06.890 --> 46:10.223
I came over here to confess to
something.

46:10.435 --> 46:13.518
But I'm sure you
already figured it out.

46:13.730 --> 46:14.685
Out of bourbon.

46:16.441 --> 46:17.601
So...

46:21.655 --> 46:22.690
[sighs]

46:23.573 --> 46:26.064
Tell me what you did, Barlow.
[sighs]

46:26.284 --> 46:29.401
Well... it's not like
I planned it.

46:29.621 --> 46:31.737
I just found myself there

46:31.957 --> 46:34.073
with a gun in my hand,
and, uh...

46:36.878 --> 46:39.164
I shot at Nighthorse.

46:40.423 --> 46:42.004
Why?

46:42.217 --> 46:45.209
Son of a bitch killed my son.
You said so yourself.

46:46.429 --> 46:48.681
Well, you, uh...

46:48.890 --> 46:51.222
caused a real problem
for me, Barlow.

46:51.434 --> 46:53.174
Nighthorse thinks
I'm the one that shot at him.

46:53.395 --> 46:54.635
[Barlow] Well,
that's what I'm doing here.

46:54.854 --> 46:56.640
I want to come clean.

46:56.856 --> 46:59.108
I'm prepared to face
the consequences.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.978
Well, I understand

47:01.152 --> 47:03.234
wanting to take out the man
that killed the person I love,

47:03.446 --> 47:06.108
but that's
not what happened here.

47:07.701 --> 47:09.362
Now, why would I make that up?

47:09.577 --> 47:12.068
[Walt]
Well, I know you shot at him.

47:12.289 --> 47:13.904
But you're lying about why.

47:15.250 --> 47:16.660
You're a pretty good shot,
Barlow.

47:16.876 --> 47:18.161
You wouldn't
have missed him twice

47:18.378 --> 47:20.619
if you were trying
to hit him, no.

47:20.839 --> 47:23.455
No, that wasn't about revenge.

47:23.675 --> 47:26.712
You were trying to miss him,
pin it on me.

47:27.762 --> 47:30.253
That's why you left
the Rainier can behind.

47:30.473 --> 47:31.974
[chuckles]

47:32.183 --> 47:33.719
I think that beer's
gone straight to your head.

47:33.935 --> 47:35.345
[Walt chuckles]

47:39.399 --> 47:40.935
[sighs]

47:41.151 --> 47:45.485
You even used a gun
the same caliber as my rifle.

47:48.158 --> 47:49.989
Even I was starting to think
I'd done it.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.737
[can clatters]

47:51.953 --> 47:53.068
You're crazy.

47:53.288 --> 47:54.903
[Walt]
Why frame me, Barlow?

47:55.123 --> 47:56.954
Unless you're trying to take
my focus off

47:57.167 --> 47:58.577
investigating Branch's murder.

47:58.793 --> 48:00.044
Why would I want to do that?

48:00.253 --> 48:01.584
Because you don't want me
to find out

48:01.796 --> 48:02.956
who was really behind it.

48:03.173 --> 48:05.164
We already know
who was behind it.

48:05.383 --> 48:08.375
Well, whoever it was
knew Branch well.

48:09.512 --> 48:12.800
Knew where he hid his key.
Knew how to get into his house.

48:13.016 --> 48:15.803
He typed a suicide note
on his computer

48:16.019 --> 48:17.884
that sounded like Branch.

48:18.104 --> 48:19.810
With one exception.

48:20.023 --> 48:21.809
They didn't know that Branch
and my daughter

48:22.025 --> 48:23.686
had broken up a few weeks ago.

48:25.695 --> 48:29.654
I understand Cady came by
and broke the news to you.

48:32.869 --> 48:35.952
You think a father could kill
his own son?

48:37.707 --> 48:40.414
You really think
I'm capable of that?

48:42.796 --> 48:44.377
Well, I didn't before today.

48:46.925 --> 48:50.167
But you told Cady you got
some texts from Branch

48:50.387 --> 48:51.843
the night before he died.

48:53.098 --> 48:54.679
Well, uh...

48:57.477 --> 49:00.765
I looked on your phone, and
not only did you get no texts

49:00.980 --> 49:04.108
from him that night,
but, uh, over the past year,

49:04.317 --> 49:06.103
you barely texted at all.

49:08.113 --> 49:10.320
Well, I'm just like you.
I'm not much of a texter.

49:10.532 --> 49:14.024
Well, actually, you are.

49:14.244 --> 49:18.487
You wrote all those texts
to Cady from Branch's phone.

49:18.706 --> 49:23.075
You did everything you could
to make it look like a suicide.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.671
You drove Branch's truck
back to his house.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.212
You wrote a note
on his computer.

49:29.175 --> 49:31.427
You got his uniform,

49:31.636 --> 49:33.422
staged that whole thing
down by the river

49:33.638 --> 49:38.348
where the water would wash away
anything you overlooked.

49:41.688 --> 49:43.929
How'd you get yourself home
from there, Barlow?

49:44.816 --> 49:47.057
ldidn't see any signs
of your horse down at the river.

49:48.736 --> 49:50.943
I guess you could've used that,
uh, mountain bike

49:51.156 --> 49:52.566
I saw at your house.

49:53.700 --> 49:56.157
Oh, anyway, I --

49:56.369 --> 49:58.075
I got to hand it to you.

49:58.288 --> 50:00.119
You thought of everything.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.822
Really, your only mistake...

50:05.128 --> 50:06.584
...was the shotgun.

50:08.756 --> 50:12.374
After you shot Branch,
you ejected the shell,

50:12.594 --> 50:14.084
just -- just out of instinct.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.922
You didn't realize when you
put it back in the weapon

50:19.142 --> 50:24.762
there was dirt inside the shell
and pollen.

50:26.524 --> 50:29.607
Pollen from flowers
I found on your property.

50:34.324 --> 50:36.406
Well, I got to hand it
to you, Walt.

50:36.618 --> 50:39.530
You are one
sharp son of a bitch.

50:39.746 --> 50:42.579
You seem to have an answer
for everything.

50:46.753 --> 50:48.709
Well, not everything.

50:50.215 --> 50:52.456
I still don't know why.

50:53.635 --> 50:55.671
Why you would kill your own son.

50:58.765 --> 51:02.178
Because he wasn't my son,
you son of a bitch! That's why!

51:02.393 --> 51:06.136
Now, he might've had my genes,
but he didn't have my character.

51:06.356 --> 51:10.099
He had no --
no sense of loyalty about him.

51:10.318 --> 51:11.808
Even after he started
working for me,

51:12.028 --> 51:13.893
he was still working for you!

51:15.657 --> 51:17.113
Working for me?

51:17.325 --> 51:18.861
Yeah.

51:19.077 --> 51:20.533
On what?

51:20.745 --> 51:21.860
Well, if you don't know,

51:22.080 --> 51:24.071
I'm sure as hell
not gonna tell you.

51:36.761 --> 51:39.343
You took those cameras
from Branch's house.

51:42.225 --> 51:45.012
All this while, I thought...

51:45.979 --> 51:48.391
...Branch found out something
about Nighthorse

51:48.606 --> 51:51.097
on those surveillance cameras,
but it was you.

51:51.985 --> 51:53.475
It was you.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.935
He was surveilling Nighthorse,

51:56.155 --> 51:58.737
but he found out something
about you.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.235
[chuckles]

52:00.451 --> 52:04.069
Oh, he was a smart boy. Yeah.

52:04.289 --> 52:06.120
He discovered it weeks before
you did.

52:10.628 --> 52:15.543
And my daughter figured it out
earlier today.

52:15.758 --> 52:16.873
She --

52:18.886 --> 52:22.595
Branch got caught
between you and Nighthorse.

52:22.807 --> 52:25.139
You two aren't enemies.
You're --

52:25.351 --> 52:26.431
You're working together.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.180
[chuckles]

52:28.396 --> 52:30.387
Your real-estate developments,
your golf course --

52:30.607 --> 52:32.438
None of that pays off
without a lot of people.

52:36.821 --> 52:40.188
People that Nighthorse's casino
will bring.

52:40.408 --> 52:44.071
That Indian had a lot of good
ideas, not much capital.

52:48.958 --> 52:53.668
My wife and I... were
in your way.

52:53.880 --> 52:58.089
You know what the definition
of a conservationist is, Walt?

52:59.594 --> 53:02.961
That's somebody
who's already got his own land

53:03.181 --> 53:05.388
and tries to squash
everybody else's chance

53:05.600 --> 53:06.806
of getting some of their own.

53:07.018 --> 53:08.758
You and your wife
were living out here

53:08.978 --> 53:12.061
and just killing
everybody else's chance

53:12.273 --> 53:14.355
of making some money
for themselves.

53:17.654 --> 53:18.734
You...

53:20.198 --> 53:21.984
...and Nighthorse...

53:24.202 --> 53:26.318
...killed her.

53:26.537 --> 53:28.949
That's what Branch thought
to begin with.

53:29.165 --> 53:31.030
[sighs]

53:31.250 --> 53:33.912
David Ridges killed your wife.

53:34.128 --> 53:36.380
On whose orders?

53:41.386 --> 53:42.922
Mine.

53:44.681 --> 53:47.514
I had worked too hard
and too long

53:47.725 --> 53:51.058
to let you and that bitch wife
of yours stand in my way.

53:51.270 --> 53:52.851
Why didn't you just kill me?

53:53.064 --> 53:54.975
Oh, no.

53:55.191 --> 53:57.227
That would've drawn too much
attention.

53:57.443 --> 54:00.560
So, when you couldn't get
at me...

54:02.824 --> 54:04.735
...you went after the thing
I loved.

54:04.909 --> 54:06.615
[Barlow]
Oh, come on, Walt.

54:08.538 --> 54:10.449
Martha had cancer.

54:10.665 --> 54:13.031
She was already dead.

54:14.293 --> 54:16.909
Now, what did I do?

54:17.130 --> 54:21.920
Shorten her life by a few weeks?
Maybe a few months.

54:24.387 --> 54:26.594
I'll see you rot for this

54:26.806 --> 54:28.967
for the rest
of your miserable life.

54:29.183 --> 54:30.593
You won't.

54:30.810 --> 54:32.550
This is my county.

54:33.354 --> 54:36.437
There's no way that I'm gonna
let you lock me up.

54:36.607 --> 54:39.269
Nobody is taking me
from my rightful home.

54:40.319 --> 54:41.729
Drop the gun!

54:45.783 --> 54:47.648
[pistol clicking]

54:54.083 --> 54:57.371
[sighs]
You just shot a defenseless man.

55:00.089 --> 55:03.456
You invited me to your cabin

55:03.676 --> 55:05.416
and then you killed me.
[chuckles]

55:05.636 --> 55:08.628
You're not gonna die,
you son of a bitch.

55:08.848 --> 55:10.509
I won't let you.

55:12.643 --> 55:13.894
Not gonna let you --
Get up!

55:14.103 --> 55:15.092
-Let me go.
-Get up!

55:15.313 --> 55:17.804
-Aah!
-Come on!

55:18.024 --> 55:20.015
They're gonna sew you up,

55:20.234 --> 55:22.725
and you're gonna have to live
with what you've done!

55:38.961 --> 55:40.872
l...
[breathing heavily]

55:41.088 --> 55:43.295
I'm not going to a hospital.

55:43.508 --> 55:45.419
You just let me die, Walt.

55:47.428 --> 55:49.384
You know you want to.

55:50.431 --> 55:52.968
I killed my own son.

55:53.184 --> 55:54.594
Aah!

55:56.938 --> 55:59.771
I killed him!
[grunts]

56:18.918 --> 56:20.158
[laughs]

56:20.378 --> 56:22.460
Good luck explaining this one,
Walt.

56:23.756 --> 56:25.667
[grunts]

56:25.883 --> 56:27.589
I'll be ready.

56:32.265 --> 56:34.176
And you'll be in hell.

56:41.816 --> 56:43.556
[grunts]

56:45.903 --> 56:48.394
[breathing heavily]
