...I enjoy
solving puzzles.

09:15.088 --> 09:19.057
I mean,
what greater riddle is there?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.126
Well, what's to solve?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.395
You want to live
forever?

09:25.465 --> 09:26.998
Not exactly.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.402
Then<i> what</i> exactly?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.005
[ timer beeping ]

09:34.007 --> 09:35.574
Time's up.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.143
[ device beeps ]
[ groans ]

09:38.145 --> 09:39.544
No, henry!
What are you doing?

09:39.546 --> 09:42.180
Well, the levels
are quite low.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.750
See, this window
is badly sealed.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.552
Some of the gas
would have escaped here.

09:47.554 --> 09:50.422
It might have rendered him
unconscious, but...

09:50.424 --> 09:52.123
He<i> didn't</i> asphyxiate.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.758
Oh, no, he did.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.293
But not from the gas.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.530
There are four ways
a man can asphyxiate --

09:58.532 --> 10:04.035
Strangulation, blocked airway,
inert-gas inhalation,

10:04.037 --> 10:06.771
Compression
of chest and diaphragm.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.773
I'm missing something.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.642
Time for a closer look.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.911
If we are doing
blades and cutting,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.779
I might just
go get a coffee.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.482
Oh, this won't take long.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.056
There.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.927

around the mouth,

10:28.929 --> 10:30.662
Hidden by the beard.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.765
A hand, perhaps.

10:33.767 --> 10:34.966
He was unconscious,

10:34.968 --> 10:37.469
So it would've only taken
a slight pressure.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.904
So our killer
was in the apartment.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.340
[ sighs ]

10:43.543 --> 10:45.443
Mm. Hey.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.446
Look at this.
Not eating breakfast at my desk.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.815
I dig this new way
of fighting crime.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.083
Yes, about that.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.219
We did a test,
and the rate at which gas

10:54.221 --> 10:56.054
Displaces air --
oh. Did i mention?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.455
We got the guy.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.091
Jo: Wait.
You have a suspect?

11:00.093 --> 11:01.092
Lawrence creff?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.594
Yeah, these guys,
they, um,

11:02.596 --> 11:05.096
They traced the signal --
whatever -- from his laptop.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.765
He was<i> with</i> his laptop?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.901
Witnesses put creff in his condo
with the laptop that night.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.436
It wasn't him.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.238
We traced the command payload
to shaw's thermostat i.P.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.639
Through a randomized
botnet path,

11:14.641 --> 11:16.474
Which we backtracked
and confirmed.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.476
We gassed ourselves,
shaved a corpse,

11:18.478 --> 11:20.378
And determined
whoever killed shaw

11:20.380 --> 11:21.880
Did it by hand
in his apartment.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.181
Yeah,
if creff was home,

11:23.183 --> 11:24.516
That proves
he didn't kill eric shaw.

11:24.518 --> 11:27.852
You shaved
a corpse?

11:33.660 --> 11:35.060
Creff: The idea
that i killed eric shaw,

11:35.062 --> 11:36.761
Either in person
or with my computer,

11:36.763 --> 11:39.397
Is so ludicrous that i won't
even wait for my lawyer.

11:39.399 --> 11:43.668
I was with my wife
and our tax attorney all night.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.271
So, what are you saying?
Someone framed your computer?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.473
Who'd even think of that
or know how?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.275
The faceless
spring to mind, no?

11:50.277 --> 11:53.978
Okay. Here are the shots
of the contusions.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.614
I timed it with a little bit
of extra blue there

11:56.616 --> 11:58.516
To bring out
the lividity.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.351
Hey.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.887
Lucas,
assistant m.E.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.956
Tasteful, huh?
[ chuckles nervously ]

12:05.959 --> 12:09.360
Oh, sorry. In homicide, we're
all rather used to dead bodies.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.630
The...Gross stuff,
it grosses me out.

12:12.632 --> 12:13.898
Well,
it's not that gross.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.567
It doesn't look like that,
you know?

12:15.569 --> 12:18.436
The smell is what really
gets to you, though.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.572
I can give you a tour
a-anytime, o.C.M.E.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.941
Just come on down.
I'll probably be there.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.242
[ chuckles ] so...

12:26.279 --> 12:28.413
It's a little strong.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.016
Maybe try again --
a bit more subtly.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.052
Oh.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.454
Copy that.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.590
Where was this?
<i>What i'm saying, gentlemen,</i>

12:38.592 --> 12:40.325
<i>Is invest in umbrellas,</i>

12:41.828 --> 12:43.661
They must have hacked
the security footage.

12:43.663 --> 12:46.064
[<i> applause</i> ]
where'd the sound
come from?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.599
Security cameras
shoot images.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.801
Somebody planted
a microphone.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.035
Impossible.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.871
Everyone is vetted, from guests
down to cater-waiters.

12:52.873 --> 12:56.975
They don't pay 10 grand a plate
for pasta nero if we're lax.

12:57.944 --> 13:02.013
Eric shaw's last meal
was squid-ink pasta.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.414
Do you recall the caterer?

13:03.416 --> 13:05.350
I don't hire the help.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.719
You can ask my assistant.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.355
This one?

13:10.357 --> 13:12.891
[ chuckles ]

13:12.893 --> 13:13.892
Great.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.426
This is how it is now?

13:15.428 --> 13:18.930
<i>Does no one have</i>
<i>any damn privacy anymore?</i>

13:22.002 --> 13:24.502
Anne:
I know that hero doctor.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.671
[ sighs ]
this really wasn't necessary.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.140
Henry, you saved the life
of a little boy.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.575
I thought
it was heroic.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.611
And clearly,
the newspaper did, too.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.313
It's inspiring.
People want to read about it.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.681
That's debatable.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.017
I really don't see the need
for that display.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.385
The chief administrator

13:40.387 --> 13:42.687
Thinks it's good promotion
for the hospital --

13:42.689 --> 13:45.590
Mercy doctors, saving lives
on and off the job.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.328
<i>I'd</i> want to be saved
by you.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.869
Henry, is there something
you haven't told me?

13:57.871 --> 14:00.672
A secret, perhaps?

14:00.674 --> 14:01.806
No. Why?

14:01.808 --> 14:03.541
Because there's a woman
in the waiting room

14:03.543 --> 14:05.076
Who says she's your wife.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.017
I'm dr. Morgan.
You wanted to see me?

14:21.494 --> 14:24.295
When i saw your picture
in the paper,

14:24.297 --> 14:27.031
I-i didn't believe it.

But it's true.

that what i told you is real.

You know,
that faceless stuff

about my old activist days --

Hey, there's eggs,

Yes, i wanted to ask you
about that.

15:16.850 --> 15:21.619
In an activist group,
you've got devoted individuals

15:21.621 --> 15:23.821
With strong-held,
high ideals.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.591
Did things ever get tense
between you?

15:26.593 --> 15:27.992
Well, it<i> could.</i>

15:27.994 --> 15:30.161
I remember we had
a daylong screaming fight

15:30.163 --> 15:33.064
Over whether to say
"unjust" or "unfair" on a sign.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.399
[ chuckles ]

15:34.401 --> 15:36.768
But the biggest hassles,
they were the personal dramas --

15:36.770 --> 15:38.569

who's mean, who's bossy,

15:38.571 --> 15:39.637
Who just smokes weed.

with this guy ira bing.

Big mess.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.650
See, that's the problem
with activism.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.320
No matter how high the ideals,
you're just human.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.255
We'd have ended that war
years earlier

come around.

But<i> he</i> didn't work it.

Can we get a list of everyone
that worked the fundraiser?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.479

We already did this
with mr. Creff's people.
