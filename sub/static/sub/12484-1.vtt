00:11.110 --> 00:12.530
Oh my gosh.

00:12.530 --> 00:14.220
Dad! Look at this place!

00:14.650 --> 00:17.490
Lockers instead of ***.

00:17.660 --> 00:20.690
Drivers Ed instead of Kiddie Vice.

00:22.020 --> 00:24.700
Him instead of...

00:25.330 --> 00:26.910
What was I talking about?

00:27.580 --> 00:30.790
Dad! Did she has to go to my high school?

00:30.790 --> 00:32.950
I mean seriously she's only eleven.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.180
It's not Chyna's fault that she's gifted.

00:35.180 --> 00:37.690
Any more than it's your fault that you're not.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.990
Ah... great. Another ant.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.620
Hey what's with the name calling?

00:50.680 --> 00:52.440
No. It's OK, dad.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.020
I'm an ant because I'm in the advanced
natural talents or A.N.T programs.

00:57.050 --> 00:59.410
Yeah. I wasn't
talking about you.

00:59.410 --> 01:02.720
Someone knocked over the little
ant farm again this morning.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.260
These little creepers are everywhere!

01:05.290 --> 01:06.290
Ugh!

01:06.330 --> 01:07.330
Ahhh! Get it off!

01:07.360 --> 01:09.230
I mean, get it off.
Get it off.

01:09.660 --> 01:12.330
Anyway, you must be Chyna.

01:12.370 --> 01:15.300
Welcome to the Ant Farm!

01:15.330 --> 01:17.240
I love doing that.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.340
Um, are you my teacher?

01:23.380 --> 01:26.250
No, teachers need a degree.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.610
I'm Gibson.

01:27.650 --> 01:31.220
Your tutor, guidance
counselor and therapist,

01:31.250 --> 01:32.420
all rolled up in one.

01:32.450 --> 01:34.560
I also give out licorice.

01:35.630 --> 01:37.560
Uh, no, thanks.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.700
I had hair-covered
licorice for breakfast.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.270
Not so fast,
bumblebee. A-ha!

01:44.640 --> 01:46.270
Sorry I'm late.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.570
Security hassled me about my battle ax.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.710
Mom!

01:50.740 --> 01:55.250
Whoa! Your mom's a warrior princess?
Awesome!

01:55.280 --> 01:57.720
No, no, she's a children's
birthday party entertainer.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.420
More awesome!

01:59.450 --> 02:02.350
Hey, keep January 27th open.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.650
Oh, you have kids?

02:03.690 --> 02:04.750
Nope!

02:58.570 --> 03:00.440
Just like you with music,

03:00.470 --> 03:03.240
each student in the ANT
Program has a unique gift.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.150
Benny is a robotics expert.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.410
<i>Greetings.</i>

03:10.080 --> 03:13.290
Angus here is a computer genius.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.350
Ooh, that looks cool!
Can I play?

03:16.390 --> 03:18.320
<i>Missile launch initiated.</i>

03:18.660 --> 03:20.660
Am I winning the game?

03:21.860 --> 03:24.830
Sure, 'cause it's a game.
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

03:24.870 --> 03:26.600
Just a game.

03:26.630 --> 03:28.800
<i>Missile launch aborted.</i>

03:32.510 --> 03:34.670
And then there's Svetlana, our gymnast.

03:34.710 --> 03:37.410
Hey, where is Svetlana?

03:37.450 --> 03:38.650
Hello!

03:39.810 --> 03:42.450
You need to stop doing that!

03:42.480 --> 03:43.750
<i>Nyet! Nyet!</i>

03:43.780 --> 03:45.590
Don't say "no" to me.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.750
Oh!

03:47.790 --> 03:51.490
You know, she might have
been saying, "Net, net."

03:51.520 --> 03:52.560
Oh.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.800
Uh, sir?

03:58.830 --> 04:01.500
I don't mean to alarm you or anything,

04:01.530 --> 04:03.470
but this kid has a dead body.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.740
It's wax.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.440
Some people make friends.

04:06.470 --> 04:09.510
Fletcher here has to
literally make friends.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.480
I'm an artist.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.710
As a project, I'm sculpting
the entire class in beeswax.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.650
Well, they're beautiful.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.649
You're beautiful.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.750
I mean, your music is beautiful.

04:20.790 --> 04:23.520
But you've never heard me play.

04:23.560 --> 04:28.660
Yeah, I know, but, you see, I...

04:31.400 --> 04:32.700
Hmm, wherever could he be?

04:32.730 --> 04:34.530
Hi. I'm Chyna.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.670
Chyna. Named for one of Earth's
oldest continuous civilizations,

04:36.700 --> 04:40.770
whose dynasties include the Shang,
Tang, Xin, Ming and San Huang Di Wu.

04:42.540 --> 04:44.780
So, your gift is

04:44.810 --> 04:46.480
talking?

04:46.510 --> 04:48.650
I'm Olive.
I have an eidetic memory,

04:48.680 --> 04:52.450
so everything I've ever heard, seen or read

04:52.490 --> 04:54.390
is permanently etched into my brain.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.590
Wow! That's cool.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.730
It's a blessing and a curse.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.700
So, Chyna, did they give
you your new AntPad yet?

05:06.740 --> 05:10.440
Oh! Yup.
This thing is so cool!

05:10.470 --> 05:12.510
Check out all these apps.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.580
Calendar app, GPS app.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.480
Nap app?

05:17.510 --> 05:18.680
Oh, no, no, don't...

05:25.490 --> 05:27.820
Oh, no!
Homeroom's almost over!

05:27.860 --> 05:29.760
Wait. Hey, guys,
what's going on?

05:29.790 --> 05:31.560
Run! Run!

05:31.590 --> 05:33.460
Whoa!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait!
What's the rush?

05:35.530 --> 05:36.800
Second period
doesn't start till 10:00.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.370
It's not about when next period starts.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.600
It's about when this one ends!

05:41.700 --> 05:43.470
Run!
Run!

05:45.470 --> 05:47.770
Help! Help!

05:47.810 --> 05:49.540
Angus!
We've got to save Angus!

05:49.580 --> 05:51.380
Forget it, man!
Angus is gone!

05:51.410 --> 05:52.850
But...
He's gone!

05:54.550 --> 05:57.420
Tell my mother I loved her!

06:05.500 --> 06:09.330
Looks like somebody's sitting in my chair.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.740
Ooh, I love this story!

06:11.770 --> 06:13.600
Get to the part where
they eat the porridge.

06:14.610 --> 06:16.710
Hi, I'm Chyna.

06:16.740 --> 06:19.780
Well, let's see if this china's breakable.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.510
Good morning, class!

06:24.550 --> 06:25.710
I... Ooh.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.620
Lexi's chair?
Yeah.

06:27.650 --> 06:28.680
Rookie mistake.

06:32.390 --> 06:35.660
So, you must be my new prodigy.

06:35.690 --> 06:36.820
Play something!

06:36.860 --> 06:37.860
Okay.

06:45.470 --> 06:47.670
I meant on the violin.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.770
Oh. Right.
See, I knew that.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.530
That was incredible!
Thanks.

07:14.570 --> 07:18.770
Now, class, this semester, I will
be putting on <i>Hairspray.</i>

07:18.800 --> 07:21.370
Um, don't you need hair for that, sir?

07:23.410 --> 07:27.610
Not the styling product.
The Broadway musical!

07:27.640 --> 07:30.550
You can sign up for cast,
crew or orchestra.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.350
I'm going out for cast

07:35.390 --> 07:37.750
because, obviously,
I'm the leading-man type.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.420
I was in that play,
<i>Les Miserables.</i>

07:40.460 --> 07:43.360
I played Les.

07:43.390 --> 07:45.760
And I'm sure everyone else was miserable.

07:47.670 --> 07:51.670
Now, of course, my audition
is merely a formality,

07:51.700 --> 07:54.670
since I've starred in every
musical we've ever done.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.510
<i>Grease.</i>

07:58.780 --> 07:59.780
<i>Annie.</i>

08:02.480 --> 08:03.750
<i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

08:05.720 --> 08:07.790
Wow. You grew whiskers.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.460
They're fake.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.560
Oh! I'm not talking about
the ones in the picture.

08:18.460 --> 08:19.560
What are you doing?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.430
Do not anger the big kids!

08:21.470 --> 08:23.370
They'll kill us, make
jewelry out of our bones

08:23.400 --> 08:24.670
and then sell them at craft fairs!

08:24.700 --> 08:26.600
I do not want to end up around the neck

08:26.640 --> 08:29.540
of a middle-aged woman
in a jean skirt!

08:29.570 --> 08:32.679
Just relax. We're in class.
Nobody can hurt us in here.

08:32.710 --> 08:35.380
Hey!
Get me out of here!

08:35.409 --> 08:37.610
Okay, Fletcher, just relax
your cheek muscles.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.380
Oh, not those cheek muscles!

08:40.419 --> 08:42.490
Oh, wait a minute.
I got an idea!

08:47.630 --> 08:50.490
See? We made it to lunch.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.460
Now, where's the cafeteria?

08:52.500 --> 08:53.630
What?
No, no, no, no.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.570
We eat in the safety of the Ant Farm.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.370
Wait. I left my lunch
in my locker.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.840
Emma left her lunch in her locker.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.710
Who's Emma?
Exactly.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.780
Look, there is a cupcake in that lunch.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.510
I'm going for it!

09:07.540 --> 09:09.510
Okay, but hurry, before the bell...

09:09.550 --> 09:12.310
We're doomed!

09:12.350 --> 09:13.620
No, we're not!
Get in, get in! Hurry!

09:13.650 --> 09:14.650
Okay. Okay.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.320
See? There are advantages to being
the smallest kids in school.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.630
And you were right.

09:23.660 --> 09:25.490
This cupcake was so worth it.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.700
This is not my locker
and that's not a cupcake.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.370
That would explain the tail.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
Ooh!

09:39.610 --> 09:42.680
Can you believe that showoff Chyna?

09:42.710 --> 09:45.750
I thought she was really good
on that tiny chin guitar.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.520
So, are your rents still on vaycay?

09:49.550 --> 09:52.620
Yep. Party tonight. My place.
It's gonna be ridic.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.560
Ooh! Text me the deets.
Kay.

09:54.590 --> 09:55.720
Aws.
Late.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.190
Are you crazy?

10:05.220 --> 10:07.190
The big kids do not want us at their party.

10:07.220 --> 10:08.350
They hate us.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.090
She's not wrong.

10:12.530 --> 10:15.460
Look, guys, this is Lexi's party.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.460
This is our chance to show her
that we belong in this school.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.230
All we need to do is make
ourselves look a little older.

10:26.570 --> 10:29.180
What? You said
to look older.

10:31.350 --> 10:34.280
That is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever seen.

10:35.350 --> 10:36.480
Hey, party people!

10:40.260 --> 10:42.360
And suddenly you're in second place.

10:44.160 --> 10:49.160
So, do we look like high schoolers or what?

10:50.500 --> 10:52.300
Why do I smell fruit?

10:52.330 --> 10:54.230
It's blueberry yogurt.

10:54.270 --> 10:55.300
I wanted them to look natural

10:55.340 --> 10:57.240
and the label said
"all natural."

10:59.270 --> 11:00.370
Hey, Chyna.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.510
Dad!

11:01.540 --> 11:05.310
Hey! You didn't tell me
your dad was a mall cop.

11:05.350 --> 11:09.080
I'm a highly decorated member of the
San Francisco Police Department.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.490
You see this medal?
Cleanest cop car.

11:16.090 --> 11:18.230
Dad, I thought you said
you had a meeting tonight.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.260
Oh, yeah, the chief had to cancel.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.460
His car was stolen.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.270
So, who are your friends?

11:28.300 --> 11:31.370
Oh, uh, Dad, this is Olive and Fletcher.

11:31.410 --> 11:34.070
Friends are here to do homework.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.480
Then why do they look like the
Monopoly Man and the community chest?

11:39.250 --> 11:41.250
Yeah, because

11:41.280 --> 11:44.120
we're studying <i>Pygmalion</i>
<i>in English class,</i>

11:44.150 --> 11:45.390
and it's easier if we act it out.

11:45.420 --> 11:49.120
See, he's Professor Higgins
and she's Eliza Doolittle.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.590
Eliza, do a little.

11:54.260 --> 11:58.230
'Ow do ya do, guvnah?
I'm just a simple flower girl, I am.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.170
We need to find a way to get to that party.

12:06.210 --> 12:08.510
Well, why can't we just
climb out the window?

12:08.540 --> 12:13.210
Because if my dad checks on us
and I'm not here, he'll freak.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.280
Man, I wish he'd just mind his own beeswax.

12:16.220 --> 12:18.190
Beeswax! That's it!

12:20.360 --> 12:22.560
Fletcher, these are so realistic.

12:25.430 --> 12:27.130
But the eyes creep me out.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.100
Well, I hate your nose.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.200
Will these really fool your parents?

12:32.240 --> 12:33.540
Oh, well, my mom's out to dinner.

12:33.570 --> 12:36.170
And my dad, he's out to lunch.

12:38.140 --> 12:40.380
He'll never know, especially
if we dim the lights.

12:42.380 --> 12:45.180
Now let's go get our party on!

12:49.250 --> 12:51.120
Hey, beautiful.

12:51.150 --> 12:52.290
Let's go!
Nothing!

13:12.270 --> 13:14.470
Okay, we did it.
We made it to a high school party.

13:14.510 --> 13:17.080
Good times. Great memories.
Let's go.

13:17.110 --> 13:19.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:19.180 --> 13:21.050
We'll be fine

13:21.080 --> 13:23.150
as long as we don't draw
attention to ourselves.

13:23.180 --> 13:24.320
Come on, let's go.

13:28.220 --> 13:29.420
My yogurt's on the move.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.400
Wow. Add a church hat
and some dentures

13:36.430 --> 13:38.230
and you could be
my great-aunt Delores.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.240
Okay, Olive. Hold on.
Hold on. Goodness gracious.

13:45.570 --> 13:47.270
Okay, that's not right.

13:49.540 --> 13:50.540
Chyna?

13:53.150 --> 13:54.480
What are you doing at this party?

13:54.510 --> 13:57.550
Look, please don't tell
Dad you saw me here.

13:57.580 --> 14:01.290
Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
I thought you were grounded.

14:01.320 --> 14:05.390
I gave Angus five bucks to hack the
tracking device Dad put in my cell phone.

14:05.430 --> 14:07.230
Right now I'm at church.

14:08.360 --> 14:12.130
Oh, look, you just got a text from Satan.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.270
"See you soon."

14:17.210 --> 14:20.040
Isn't it a little late for you Ants?

14:20.080 --> 14:23.250
Shouldn't you be in your
widdle footy pajamas by now?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.550
I'll have you know that our
bedtime is not until 8:30!

14:26.420 --> 14:28.120
9:00 on weekends.

14:31.450 --> 14:34.460
Would you guys please stop saying stuff
that makes us look like little kids?

14:35.490 --> 14:38.130
Ooh, cookies!

14:40.500 --> 14:42.330
You must be the entertainment.

14:45.170 --> 14:46.470
Are you a magician?

14:46.500 --> 14:48.100
No, actually...

14:48.140 --> 14:50.270
'Cause I think magicians are so hot.

14:51.270 --> 14:52.270
Pick a card.

14:55.450 --> 14:57.350
Oh, Chyna.

14:57.380 --> 15:00.320
Why don't you tell us
about your first kiss?

15:00.350 --> 15:02.420
Oh, first kiss?
Mmm-hmm.

15:02.450 --> 15:04.220
You know, that takes me back.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.290
It was at summer camp.

15:08.330 --> 15:09.430
And his name was.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.360
Dorian.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.060
Banister.

15:15.100 --> 15:18.170
What?
You have never kissed anyone.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.340
I would have remembered that
when I read your diary.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.440
Pages and pages of nothing!

15:27.350 --> 15:29.510
Okay, concentrate on your card.

15:34.550 --> 15:37.160
I want you to empty your head of all...

15:37.190 --> 15:38.260
Done!

15:42.390 --> 15:45.330
What does a lady have to do to
get a juicy box around here?

15:46.430 --> 15:48.470
I'm sorry, we ran out.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.300
Like nine years ago.

15:52.270 --> 15:54.170
Oh! Why don't
you try this?

15:56.570 --> 15:59.240
Red Viper Soda.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.280
Okay.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.050
Wow, good stuff!

16:10.360 --> 16:13.220
Chyna? Gibson's here to see
how your first day went.

16:22.330 --> 16:25.370
Melted kid! Melted kid!

16:26.170 --> 16:27.440
It's wax.

16:27.470 --> 16:31.240
Yeah, it's totally wacks that
someone would do that to a kid.

16:31.270 --> 16:32.540
Totally wacks, yo.

16:35.140 --> 16:37.310
Oh!

16:39.380 --> 16:41.180
I'm getting nothing.

16:41.220 --> 16:43.320
I think we need to establish
a physical connection.

16:45.290 --> 16:46.290
Okay.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.390
Is it working?

16:51.430 --> 16:54.100
Oh, it's definitely working.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.140
Party!

16:59.170 --> 17:01.070
Whoa!
What happened to you?

17:01.100 --> 17:03.240
I tried this really awesome
drink called Red Viper,

17:03.270 --> 17:04.510
and I feel great!

17:04.540 --> 17:06.410
Except for my feet, which
I can't feel at all.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.180
I mean, they're still there, right?

17:08.210 --> 17:10.380
'Cause I really can't
see them with this dress.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.119
You drank Red Viper?
Mmm-hmm.

17:14.150 --> 17:16.180
Do you know what's in that junk?

17:16.220 --> 17:19.220
Sure. Carbonated water, sucrose,
glucose, sodium citrate, taurine,

17:19.250 --> 17:20.490
glucuronolactone, caffeine,

17:20.520 --> 17:23.290
calcium pantothenate, pyridoxine,
yellow dye number 7,

17:23.329 --> 17:25.460
red dye number 36...
Oh, and vitamin C,

17:25.490 --> 17:27.329
so it's good for you!

17:30.230 --> 17:32.200
Oh, no! The magician!

17:32.240 --> 17:34.370
I hope the rabbit's okay!

17:34.400 --> 17:36.510
Stay strong, little guy!

17:41.080 --> 17:42.210
Hey, magician,

17:42.250 --> 17:44.150
any chance you can make us disappear?

17:51.740 --> 17:53.610
I can't believe they snuck out.

17:53.650 --> 17:55.710
Do you have any idea where they went?

17:55.750 --> 17:58.480
I heard Lexi Reed
was throwing a party tonight.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.350
Where does she live?

18:00.390 --> 18:02.820
I don't know.
No one would text me the deets.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.360
This is highly decorated Officer Parks.

18:08.390 --> 18:10.600
I need a 10-20
on a Lexi Reed.

18:10.630 --> 18:13.770
We'll also need SWAT and that
monkey that can defuse a bomb.

18:15.370 --> 18:18.640
Actually, Officer Chimperson is dead.

18:18.670 --> 18:21.440
Turns out he really couldn't defuse a bomb.

18:21.740 --> 18:23.480
Oh.

18:23.510 --> 18:26.380
You stupid Ants ruined my party!

18:26.410 --> 18:28.710
You thought your lives were
miserable at school before?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.680
Just wait until tomorrow.

18:32.650 --> 18:35.450
"Let's go to a high school
party, it'll be fun."

18:37.360 --> 18:38.460
Another one?

18:38.490 --> 18:40.360
Don't you think this one was bad enough?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.730
We trusted you, Chyna.
And you let us down.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.340
Thanks a lot.

18:48.370 --> 18:51.570
Well, the stereo's dead,
and so is this party.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.780
Wait! If you guys
want music,

18:57.810 --> 18:59.750
I can play something.

18:59.780 --> 19:05.420
Yeah, 'cause nothing rocks the
house like a violin concerto.

19:05.450 --> 19:08.590
Actually, I was thinking I would
sing something more like this.

19:10.320 --> 19:14.360
<i>♪ I throw my hands up</i>
<i>in the air sometimes</i>

19:14.390 --> 19:20.330
<i>♪ Saying ayo</i> <i>Gotta let go</i>

19:20.370 --> 19:24.570
<i>♪ And I wanna celebrate</i>

19:36.380 --> 19:40.290

19:40.320 --> 19:42.720
<i>♪ Give me space</i> <i>for both my

19:42.760 --> 19:44.560
That girl stinks.

19:44.590 --> 19:46.360
That girl is my sister.

19:46.390 --> 19:48.430
And I'm trying to listen to her sing.

19:48.460 --> 19:49.560
Your older sister?

19:49.600 --> 19:50.670
No!

19:50.700 --> 19:53.430
<i>♪ 'Cause it goes on</i>
<i>and on and on</i>

19:53.470 --> 19:56.500

20:16.660 --> 20:18.630

20:18.660 --> 20:20.690
<i>♪ Now I told you twice</i>

20:20.730 --> 20:25.600
<i>♪ We gonna light it up</i>
<i>Like it's dynamite! ♪</i>

20:35.810 --> 20:37.680
I thought you played violin.

20:37.710 --> 20:39.550
Oh, I do.

20:39.580 --> 20:41.420
And guitar.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.650
And piano, trumpet, saxophone,
flute, cello, harp, the bagpipes,

20:44.690 --> 20:47.620
French horn, drums,
harmonica and the spoons.

20:47.660 --> 20:49.560
Oh, and I also sing a little.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.430
Yeah, a little.

20:54.460 --> 20:57.530
You know, maybe I will try
out for the school play.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.570
You should!
You're really talented!

20:59.600 --> 21:01.570
Shut up, Paisley!

21:05.510 --> 21:07.770
Sorry we, kind of, turned on you, Chyna.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.710
Although, looking back,

21:10.750 --> 21:12.650
it was mostly Olive.

21:14.550 --> 21:16.680
That was the Red Viper talking.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.720
That stuff is bad news.

21:20.350 --> 21:21.590
I still love you guys.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.360
Oh, no.

21:25.390 --> 21:27.690
It's the mall cops!

21:27.730 --> 21:31.460
I'm a highly decorated police officer.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.470
If I were a mall cop, would I have a...

21:34.500 --> 21:35.500
Where's my badge?

21:37.700 --> 21:39.500
Freeze, dirtbags!

21:39.540 --> 21:41.410
Give me that!

21:41.440 --> 21:43.680
Officer, I can explain.

21:43.710 --> 21:46.750
Don't bother.
I'm not here for you.

21:46.780 --> 21:47.780
I'm here for her.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.750
There you are, Chyna!

21:52.790 --> 21:56.490
You had me worried sick.
I left church to find you!

21:57.690 --> 21:59.460
Home. Now.

22:01.430 --> 22:05.730
And anybody else whose parents
don't know you're here, out!

22:06.770 --> 22:07.770
Not you, Gibson!

22:11.570 --> 22:13.710
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

22:13.740 --> 22:15.740
I knew you weren't ready for high school.

22:15.780 --> 22:17.710
But, Dad, I am ready.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.680
I finally found a place where I belong.

22:19.710 --> 22:23.320
Right now, the only place where you belong

22:23.350 --> 22:25.380
is in the back of my squad car.

22:25.420 --> 22:26.750
Let's go.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're
putting me in the perp cage?

22:28.820 --> 22:30.590
Do I at least get a phone call?

22:30.630 --> 22:31.760
Sure.

22:31.790 --> 22:34.460
I think your mom is gonna
want to talk to you.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.830
Yeah, I think I'll skip the phone call.

22:41.470 --> 22:44.410
Sir, madam, you have a lovely home.

22:47.810 --> 22:51.680
Why are you freaks still here?
Get out of my house!

22:51.710 --> 22:53.820
Hey! Don't you talk
to us that way!

22:53.850 --> 22:55.420
Yeah!

22:59.720 --> 23:01.620
My mom is going to kill me!

23:01.660 --> 23:04.430
Don't worry, I know how to get that out.

23:04.460 --> 23:05.760
I'll text you the deets.

23:09.530 --> 23:10.900
We looked everywhere.

23:10.930 --> 23:13.470
I guess Chyna's dad decided to
pull her out of the ANT Program.

23:15.340 --> 23:17.610
Hey, what's all that music stuff?

23:18.410 --> 23:19.480
I set it up.

23:19.510 --> 23:21.640
Chyna!

23:21.680 --> 23:23.680
We thought your dad
pulled you out of school!

23:23.710 --> 23:25.650
Oh, well, he wanted to,

23:25.680 --> 23:28.450
but I plea-bargained him down
to a three-month grounding.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.490
So, if we plan on having any more fun,

23:31.520 --> 23:33.660
Fletcher, I'm going to need a
lot more of those sculptures.

23:33.690 --> 23:35.590
They're done!

23:35.630 --> 23:37.830
I mean, they will be done.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.700
It's not like I stayed up all last night

23:40.730 --> 23:42.770
making wax sculptures of you.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.400
No, that would be weird.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.840
You see, I...

23:51.610 --> 23:52.770
He knows we can see him, right?

23:52.810 --> 23:55.480
I really don't know what
he knows at this point.

23:57.450 --> 23:59.450
Come on, let's go eat in the cafeteria.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.420
You're not scared of the big kids?

24:01.450 --> 24:03.650
Ooh! Or that lunch lady
with the hairnet

24:03.690 --> 24:04.750
on her beard?

24:06.620 --> 24:08.460
No. That whole thing
with the cops

24:08.490 --> 24:10.660
gave us Ants some serious street cred.

24:14.470 --> 24:15.700
Hey, guys,

24:15.730 --> 24:18.330
I just got back from the hospital!

24:18.370 --> 24:19.640
They gave me a pig spleen!

24:21.370 --> 24:23.570
Run!

24:23.610 --> 24:25.540
Oh, come on!

24:25.580 --> 24:29.510
Not again! Not the spleen!
Not the spleen!

24:29.710 --> 24:30.910
