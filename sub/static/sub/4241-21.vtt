<i>Nationals is in New York City,</i>
<i>and everyone's really excited.</i>

00:03.900 --> 00:05.210
<i>Jessie St. James</i>
<i>is back in town,</i>

00:05.210 --> 00:06.960
<i>and he's starting a show choir</i>
<i>consulting business.</i>

00:07.000 --> 00:08.130
Two things that I'm great at...

00:08.220 --> 00:09.930
Show choir and destroying the competition.

00:09.950 --> 00:10.850
<i>The New Directions!</i>
<i>Should hire him.</i>

00:10.890 --> 00:13.210
<i>A.) They really want to win</i>

00:13.250 --> 00:15.260

00:20.260 --> 00:22.080
New Directions!,
I would like to introduce you

00:22.130 --> 00:24.270
to our new show choir consultant...

00:24.350 --> 00:26.970
Jessie St. James.

00:27.050 --> 00:29.220
I don't trust this guy.

00:29.270 --> 00:30.690
How do we know he's not
just going to trick us

00:30.760 --> 00:32.560
into doing something stupid,
so his Alma mater wins?

00:32.610 --> 00:33.980
I don't think I need to do much tricking

00:34.060 --> 00:35.280
to get you to do something stupid, Finn.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.260
Guys, Jessie is just a consultant.

00:37.310 --> 00:39.310
I still make all the calls.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.680
Now, I have all the confidence
in the world in you guys.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.920
I just think we could use
all the help we can get.

00:43.990 --> 00:46.050
Because...

00:46.120 --> 00:47.290
This is it.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.060
We've been working so hard for two years

00:49.120 --> 00:51.580
for this moment, and that
moment is finally here.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.530
Now, I was talking with
Jessie, and he agreed

00:53.600 --> 00:55.300
that we should continue
with our successful trend

00:55.360 --> 00:57.400
of doing original songs
for the competition.

00:57.470 --> 00:59.580
I was thinking of doing one group number

00:59.640 --> 01:01.720
and one duet.
Rachel and I should sing a duet.

01:01.790 --> 01:03.440
We killed it last year
at Regionals with "Faithfully."

01:03.510 --> 01:05.770
Yeah, killed us...
we lost.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.020
May I?
Uh, yeah.

01:07.090 --> 01:09.590
I agree that Rachel should sing lead,

01:09.660 --> 01:12.010
but Finn, I think it's best
if you sit this one out.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.600
Fact is, most of the other guys
in here are better singers,

01:14.650 --> 01:17.540
and Mike Chang, who can't
even sing, can at least dance.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.100
You kind of sing and dance
like a zombie who has to poop.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.270
You-you see? You see
what I'm talking about?

01:21.320 --> 01:22.670
The guy's a jerk!

01:22.740 --> 01:25.010
Jessie, maybe you could, uh,
be a little bit gentler

01:25.080 --> 01:26.490
with your advice.
Gentle?

01:26.560 --> 01:28.200
Yes.
I'm sorry.

01:28.260 --> 01:29.650
I didn't realize that we were training

01:29.720 --> 01:31.050
for the "good try" ribbon at Nationals.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.450
I thought we were in it
to win the whole damn thing.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.890
And there's only one way we can do that.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.220
Poison darts?

01:36.290 --> 01:37.890
The Vocal Adrenaline strategy is simple...

01:37.960 --> 01:39.960
Identify your best performer

01:40.030 --> 01:42.330
and build the entire performance
around them.

01:42.390 --> 01:44.060
So what does everyone else do?

01:44.130 --> 01:45.400
And who's our star performer?

01:46.850 --> 01:48.470
We're going to have auditions to find out.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.500
I'm going to post
a sign-up sheet

01:50.570 --> 01:51.850
later this afternoon.
Mr. Shue,

01:51.940 --> 01:53.940
don't you think this
is kind of not our style?

01:54.010 --> 01:56.620
Normally, I'd agree with you,
Finn, but this is the big time.

01:56.690 --> 01:57.890
I think we should listen to Jessie.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.350
I just don't know what
you're so angry about.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.639
Honey Badger, I am lactating with rage!

02:09.710 --> 02:11.110
The Glee Club travels

02:11.170 --> 02:13.690
to New York for Nationals in one week.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.380
They have purchased airline tickets...

02:15.460 --> 02:17.360
Tickets that I would like to screw up.

02:17.430 --> 02:19.880
I asked you to recruit
an expert computer hacker,

02:19.970 --> 02:21.830
and you bring me this.

02:23.020 --> 02:24.670
Do I get a super villain nickname?

02:24.740 --> 02:26.000
Your nickname is Panda Express.

02:26.070 --> 02:28.120
But I'm not Chinese.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.670
Neither is the food at Panda Express.

02:29.730 --> 02:30.990
Look, I'm on top of this.

02:31.060 --> 02:32.460
All the official travel for the school

02:32.530 --> 02:34.060
goes through
the Lima Heights Travel Agency.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.130
All we have to do is e-mail them

02:36.200 --> 02:38.300
through Principal Figgins'
e-mail account.

02:38.370 --> 02:40.270
So what's the hold up?
We don't know his password.

02:40.350 --> 02:41.740
Principal Figgins is an idiot...

02:41.820 --> 02:43.340
Something America is chock full of.

02:43.410 --> 02:47.310
What is the most common password
in America?

02:47.380 --> 02:49.280
One, two, three, four?

02:51.630 --> 02:52.560
We're in.
Outstanding.

02:54.170 --> 02:56.250
The travel agency sent arday

02:56.340 --> 02:58.840
confirming an itinerary
with a layover in Chicago

02:58.890 --> 03:00.420
before heading on to New York.

03:00.510 --> 03:02.340
Compose an e-mail
requesting a flight

03:02.390 --> 03:04.890
that's routed through Tripoli.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.380
Tripoli?
Wait, isn't that in Libya?

03:06.430 --> 03:08.550
The second that plane touches the tarmac,

03:08.600 --> 03:10.380
they'll be swarmed by armed militants.

03:10.430 --> 03:12.770
Wait, are-are we trying
to have the Glee Club killed?

03:12.850 --> 03:14.050
Or kidnapped and killed.

03:15.550 --> 03:18.390
Panda... make it so.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.530
Someone really woke up on the
wrong side of the bed today.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.990
You have no idea.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.900
Mr. Schuester?

03:25.950 --> 03:27.080
Oh, hey, Becky.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.200
Mr. Schuester,
I'm Donna Jackson.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.500
I'm Becky's mom.

03:29.570 --> 03:32.250
I really need to talk to you.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.290
I want to be in Glee Club.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.170
Well, that's great, Becky.
Can you sing?

03:37.240 --> 03:41.510
Not really, but neither can most
of the kids in Glee Club.

03:41.580 --> 03:42.760
But I-I thought
you were having

03:42.850 --> 03:44.050
such a good time on the Cheerios!

03:44.100 --> 03:45.330
Sue kicked her off.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.100
Becky, you're off the Cheerios!

03:49.190 --> 03:51.560
I don't want to see you anymore.
Is that understood?

03:52.720 --> 03:54.690
Did I do something wrong, Coach?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.230
You heard what I said.

03:56.280 --> 03:59.250
I want your pom-poms on my desk
by the end of the day.

04:01.430 --> 04:04.490
I... I-I don't know what to say.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.020
Becky's been totally depressed.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.770
She hasn't been eating...

04:07.820 --> 04:10.630
Can I please be
in Glee Club, Mr. Shue?

04:10.710 --> 04:12.580
I just want to belong.

04:14.130 --> 04:16.829
Becky...

04:16.920 --> 04:18.950
We're a week away from Nationals.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.550
I mean... I mean, the...
the season is almost over.

04:22.620 --> 04:25.510
I'd love for you to join next year.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.780
But for now, I...

04:27.840 --> 04:30.340
I'm afraid there just
isn't a place for you.

04:30.430 --> 04:32.960
We understand.

04:33.020 --> 04:34.380
Thank you for your time.

04:34.450 --> 04:35.730
Yeah.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.400
I hate this school.

04:39.940 --> 04:40.940
You are a terrible person.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.660
Becky was loyal to you, Sue.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.110
Cheerios! Gave her
a sense of purpose,

04:44.160 --> 04:45.910
and then you just rip it away
from her for no reason.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.650
I'm going to be honest with you, Will.

04:47.700 --> 04:48.780
I do have a reason.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.620
She reminds me of my sister.

04:50.670 --> 04:52.080
What does that have to do with anything?

04:52.150 --> 04:53.420
You love your sister.

04:53.490 --> 04:56.290
I do, William, and she died yesterday.

04:59.310 --> 05:00.570
What?

05:02.440 --> 05:04.500
You know, when we were younger,
people always told me

05:04.550 --> 05:06.280
Jean wouldn't live very long.

05:06.350 --> 05:10.020
Used to be that people
with Down's didn't live past 30.

05:10.100 --> 05:14.170
But then she turned 35, and then 40,

05:14.220 --> 05:17.120
and when she turned 50, I thought, somehow,

05:17.190 --> 05:19.510
we might grow old together.

05:20.950 --> 05:22.680
Last week, she got pneumonia.

05:22.730 --> 05:25.530
Doctor said it wasn't bad,
and they put her on antibiotics.

05:28.950 --> 05:31.210
I was there with her.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.660
I wanted to stay the night,

05:33.710 --> 05:36.540
and she told me to go home.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.910
At 2:00 A.M., I got the call

05:39.000 --> 05:41.480
that she had passed away in her sleep.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.500
Sue, I am so sorry.

05:44.550 --> 05:46.800
Could you leave me alone, please?

<i>To think, two short years ago,</i>

05:58.600 --> 06:00.220
<i>I was marching down this hall</i>

06:00.270 --> 06:02.270
<i>to sign up</i>
<i>for Glee Club auditions.</i>

06:02.350 --> 06:04.570
<i>And now, look at me...</i>
<i>look at us.</i>

06:04.660 --> 06:06.240
<i>Nationals.</i>
<i>So much has changed.</i>

06:06.320 --> 06:08.740
<i>I didn't have my bangs,</i>
<i>I'd never had a boyfriend,</i>

06:08.830 --> 06:11.360
<i>and I still had</i>
<i>a tiny layer of baby fat.</i>

06:11.410 --> 06:13.060
<i>But there's one thing that</i>
<i>hasn't changed... my dreams.</i>

06:13.120 --> 06:14.700
<i>I'm still going to be a star,</i>

06:14.750 --> 06:17.070
<i>which means I would kill</i>
<i>to get this solo.</i>

06:17.120 --> 06:19.170
Hey, you haven't signed up
to be the lead vocalist

06:19.240 --> 06:20.500
at Nationals.

06:20.570 --> 06:22.120
Santana, Mercedes and Kurt have.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.670
Hey.

06:23.740 --> 06:25.680
You're the male lead of this group, Finn.

06:25.740 --> 06:28.100
Everybody looks to you for guidance.
I don't need Nationals

06:28.180 --> 06:29.510
to feel better about myself.

06:29.580 --> 06:30.880
We-we-we've...
we've been working

06:30.930 --> 06:32.930
towards this moment for two years now.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.250
And I've been busting my ass to be

06:34.300 --> 06:35.520
a better singer and dancer for two years.

06:35.590 --> 06:37.640
And that Jessie ki
comes in, and he wipes out

06:37.720 --> 06:40.560
all that hard work in ten seconds.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.140
My confidence is shot.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.890
No, you're...
you're really good, Finn.

06:43.950 --> 06:45.400
Okay?
You have to believe me.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.780
I'm... I'm Lima good.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.950
Not New York City good.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.290
R-Rachel, I'm sorry.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.400
I'm not auditioning.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.580
Wow, Will.
That's a lot of vests.

07:02.660 --> 07:05.230
Um, okay...
let's get started.

07:05.280 --> 07:09.370
So I've got one box for going with you,

07:09.420 --> 07:12.740
one box for storage and
one box for giving away.

07:12.790 --> 07:13.950
I'm not going away forever, Emma.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.040
Rehearsals for April's show

07:15.090 --> 07:16.290
start two days after Nationals,

07:16.370 --> 07:18.210
and then opening night
is three weeks later.

07:18.260 --> 07:19.430
I'm guessing we close that night

07:19.510 --> 07:21.910
and then I'm back on a bus,

07:21.960 --> 07:23.380
back to my vests the next day.

07:23.430 --> 07:24.720
Will you stop?
Stop with all that.

07:24.770 --> 07:25.920
You're too afraid to admit

07:25.970 --> 07:26.920
that you're leaving, but you are.

07:26.970 --> 07:27.970
That's why you've asked me

07:28.050 --> 07:29.250
to help pack up your apartment,

07:29.300 --> 07:30.750
and that's why we're going
through your vests.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.260
Do the kids know?
No way.

07:35.310 --> 07:37.360
Can't let anything distract them
from the task at hand.

07:37.430 --> 07:38.860
Besides, by the time they get back

07:38.930 --> 07:41.100
from summer break, I'll be home.

07:41.150 --> 07:43.620
You are so organized.

07:43.700 --> 07:44.540
Thank you.

07:46.710 --> 07:48.210
Whoa.
That one's a keeper.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.830
I wore this the first week of Glee Club.

07:51.890 --> 07:53.460
Mmm. Right.

07:53.550 --> 07:55.280
What about, um...
what about this one?

07:55.330 --> 07:57.470
Will, did you wear this
the first time you tried

07:57.550 --> 07:59.450
the new coffee machine
in the teacher's lounge?

07:59.500 --> 08:02.220
That's the one I was wearing
the first time I met you.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.060
Well, you know what?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.840
You have to let it all go.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.130
You're following your dreams.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.610
Coach Sylvester?

08:30.950 --> 08:32.580
We brought you some flowers and stuff.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.669
We're sorry for your loss.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.539
Put them over there with the rest.

08:37.620 --> 08:38.960
There were more arrangements,

08:39.010 --> 08:40.039
but I had to throw some of them out.

08:40.110 --> 08:41.880
I'm allergic to pansies.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.350
And I don't mean that as a
swipe at either of you.

08:44.430 --> 08:47.330
So... why'd you bother
doing this...

08:47.380 --> 08:50.520
Buying me flowers, comforting me...

08:50.600 --> 08:52.040
After I've actively

08:52.100 --> 08:54.310
made your life a living hell

08:54.360 --> 08:55.890
and enjoyed doing it?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.980
We both know what it's like

08:58.030 --> 08:59.810
to lose someone really close to you.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.530
I sort of do.
My dad died when I was a baby.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.570
Yeah. His dad's dead,
and my mom's dead.

09:04.650 --> 09:07.650
So how do you think you can help me?

09:07.700 --> 09:10.690
Are you here to tell me how to
deal with this? Not at all.

09:10.740 --> 09:12.820
'Cause if I was being honest with you,

09:12.870 --> 09:14.580
Eddie Munster and Herman Munster,

09:14.660 --> 09:17.130
I don't know how to deal with this.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.370
I can't go back into that nursing home

09:21.420 --> 09:23.870
and start sorting through Jean's things.

09:23.940 --> 09:26.370
And I won't plan a funeral.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.510
Have you told your mother yet?

09:28.560 --> 09:29.890
As far as I'm concerned,

09:29.980 --> 09:32.760
she said her good-byes to us
years ago.

09:32.830 --> 09:34.830
If you boys would really like to help me,

09:34.900 --> 09:36.430
you might start by explaining

09:36.510 --> 09:39.100
why it was her time and not mine.

09:39.180 --> 09:41.770
She's the sweetest person I ever met.

09:41.850 --> 09:45.670
And as both of you can attest,
I'm probably the meanest,

09:45.740 --> 09:47.020
so how come I'm the one

09:47.080 --> 09:49.240
still standing here talking to you?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.060
<i>We need to help her.</i>

09:54.120 --> 09:56.170
She's overwhelmed, and...

09:56.230 --> 09:57.370
She needs us to help her.

09:57.420 --> 09:59.090
Seriously?
I'd like to put

09:59.170 --> 10:01.620
the "fun" back in "funeral"
just as much as the next girl,

10:01.710 --> 10:03.090
but why would the Glee Club

10:03.170 --> 10:04.590
help Coach Sylvester plan a service?

10:04.660 --> 10:07.630
We're not doing it for Sue;
We're doing it for her sister.

10:07.710 --> 10:09.230
Jean is just like us, guys.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.420
I mean, she's been an outsider
and an underdog

10:11.470 --> 10:12.930
all of her life.

10:13.020 --> 10:14.450
We, of all people, should celebrate that.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.970
Can I say something?

10:17.060 --> 10:18.810
When someone dies, yes, it's a tragedy,

10:18.890 --> 10:21.060
but it's also a part of life.

10:21.110 --> 10:23.110
And you can't let death
put your life on hold.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.480
Now, I don't mean to be blunt,

10:24.560 --> 10:26.480
but I don't think you should be
planning a funeral

10:26.550 --> 10:27.930
the same week you should be focusing

10:27.980 --> 10:29.430
on the set list for Nationals.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.070
Seriously?

10:31.120 --> 10:32.820
You... you're serious?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.270
Actually, yes, I am.

10:35.340 --> 10:37.490
Do you know what Vocal
Adrenaline is doing right now?

10:37.580 --> 10:40.110
They're in their third week
of 24-hour-a-day rehearsals.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.830
They're on an I.V. drip.

10:41.910 --> 10:43.750
That's how hard they're working.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.830
Do you know what happens
in Vocal Adrenaline

10:45.920 --> 10:48.120
if someone dies during a number?

10:48.170 --> 10:50.300
They use them as a prop,
like <i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

10:50.390 --> 10:52.290
No.

10:52.340 --> 10:53.740
Thanks for your input, Jessie, but we're

10:53.810 --> 10:55.410
helping Sue
with the service for her sister.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.930
Rachel, you said I needed
to be more of a leader

10:58.980 --> 11:00.180
of this club...
well, here goes.

11:00.270 --> 11:01.630
I'm making the call.

11:01.700 --> 11:02.520
We're doing this.

11:13.170 --> 11:15.960
Sue, hold on a second.

11:16.010 --> 11:17.510
Finn and Kurt told me that you agreed

11:17.590 --> 11:19.050
to let the Glee Club help out

11:19.130 --> 11:21.260
with your sister's funeral, and I...

11:21.330 --> 11:23.000
I just wanted to say that we're honored,

11:23.050 --> 11:25.390
and it takes a big person
to reach out like that

11:25.470 --> 11:26.770
and ask for help.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.450
I didn't ask for help;
They volunteered.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.310
And I only agreed on the condition that.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.140
Frankenteen and Lady Trousers help me

11:32.190 --> 11:33.980
clean out Jean's room at the nursing home.

11:34.030 --> 11:35.850
They look like they could use the exercise,

11:35.900 --> 11:38.480
and I like the idea of using
your glee club as unpaid labor.

11:38.530 --> 11:40.150
Sue, I know you're going
through a hard time right now.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.370
And despite our differences,
I just, I just want you to know

11:42.450 --> 11:44.490
that you can lean on me if you need to.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.740
Oh, William, I wouldn't dare lean on you.

11:46.820 --> 11:50.210
So much grease in your hair,
I'd probably slide right off.

11:54.580 --> 11:57.330
I'm still not convinced
that this is the best idea.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.250
I don't want any of the kids
to feel like they're losers.

11:59.340 --> 12:00.800
But that's a crucial part of the process.

12:00.870 --> 12:04.760
You see, I took a class at UCLA
in judging for reality TV shows,

12:04.840 --> 12:06.810
so I'm totally ready to give feedback

12:06.880 --> 12:08.390
that's both blistering and unhelpful.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.430
It was a really good class.
I learned a lot.

12:10.510 --> 12:13.000
We're ready for the first contestant.

12:13.070 --> 12:14.770
My name is Santana Lopez,
and I will be singing

12:14.850 --> 12:16.390
Amy Winehouse's "Back to Black."

12:20.610 --> 12:26.280
* He left no time to regret *

12:26.360 --> 12:29.780
* Kept his lips wet *

12:29.870 --> 12:35.940
* With his same old safe bet *

12:36.010 --> 12:41.880
* Me and my head high *

12:41.930 --> 12:45.380
* And my tears dry *

12:45.430 --> 12:51.350
* Get on without my guy *

12:51.420 --> 12:57.390
* And I tread a troubled track *

12:57.440 --> 13:00.860
* My odds are stacked *

13:00.930 --> 13:06.770
* I go back to black *

13:06.820 --> 13:11.270
* We only said good-bye
with words *

13:11.330 --> 13:14.880
* I died a hundred times *

13:14.950 --> 13:18.710
* You go back to her *

13:18.780 --> 13:22.120
* And I go back to... *

13:25.460 --> 13:27.620
* Black *

13:29.840 --> 13:33.300
* Black *

13:33.350 --> 13:37.630
* I go back to *

13:37.680 --> 13:42.100
* I go back to... *

13:42.160 --> 13:46.030
* We only said good-bye
with words *

13:46.110 --> 13:50.080
* I died a hundred times *

13:50.150 --> 13:53.120
* You go back to her *

13:53.170 --> 13:59.710
* And I go back to black. *.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.540
Fantastic, Santana.

14:04.550 --> 14:05.800
Thanks so much for coming in.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.850
Wait, th-that's all
you have to say?

14:09.870 --> 14:12.640
You spent the entire performance
scribbling notes.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.440
Well, if you really must know,
I was simply writing down

14:16.510 --> 14:18.390
that I don't think that
your performance went very deep

14:18.480 --> 14:20.510
into the emotional truth of the song.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.030
Oh, is that so?

14:22.100 --> 14:24.000
Well, I happen to have
some feedback for you.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.980
Thanks, Santana,
th-that's all we'll need.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.730
I'm about to go all Lima Heights.

14:27.820 --> 14:28.630
Th-Thank you.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.610
Hello, I'm Kurt Hummel, and I'll be singing.

14:34.680 --> 14:35.680
"Some People" from <i>Gypsy.</i>

14:35.740 --> 14:36.910
Ah, great selection, Kurt.

14:36.990 --> 14:38.540
Hit it.

14:44.670 --> 14:47.800
* Some people can get a thrill *

14:47.870 --> 14:51.310
* Knitting sweaters and sitting still *

14:51.370 --> 14:55.650
* That's okay for some people *

14:55.710 --> 14:59.400
* Who don't know they're alive *

14:59.480 --> 15:02.890
* Some people can thrive and bloom *

15:02.940 --> 15:06.410
* Living life in the living room *

15:06.490 --> 15:09.610
* That's perfect for some people *

15:09.690 --> 15:13.610
* Of 105 *

15:13.700 --> 15:19.090
* But I at least gotta try *

15:19.170 --> 15:22.540
* When I think of all the sights
that I gotta see *

15:22.590 --> 15:24.340
* And all the places I gotta play *

15:24.410 --> 15:26.130
* All the things that I gotta be at *

15:26.210 --> 15:27.590
* Come on, Papa,
what do you say? *

15:27.680 --> 15:31.300
* Some people can be content *

15:31.380 --> 15:34.970
* Playing bingo and paying rent *

15:35.050 --> 15:38.250
* That's peachy for some people *

15:38.310 --> 15:45.030
* For some humdrum people to be *

15:45.100 --> 15:51.100
* But some people ain't me *

15:51.150 --> 15:54.600
* I had a dream *

15:54.660 --> 15:58.070
* A wonderful dream, Papa *

16:01.780 --> 16:07.780
* Good-bye to blueberry pie *

16:07.830 --> 16:11.290
* Good riddance to
all the socials I had to go to *

16:11.340 --> 16:13.220
* All the lodges I had to play *

16:13.290 --> 16:14.840
* All the Shriners I said hello to *

16:14.930 --> 16:16.630
* Hey, L.A.,
I'm coming your way *

16:16.680 --> 16:20.230
* Some people sit on their butts *

16:20.300 --> 16:23.630
* Got the dream, yeah, but not the guts *

16:23.680 --> 16:27.020
* That's living for some people *

16:27.100 --> 16:34.360
* For some humdrum people, I suppose *

16:34.440 --> 16:37.330
* Well, they can stay and rot *

16:43.040 --> 16:47.760
* But not Rose. *.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.330
All right.
Good job, buddy.

16:51.380 --> 16:52.830
Kurt...

16:52.900 --> 16:55.550
You do know that song was meant
to be sung by a woman, right?

16:55.630 --> 16:57.300
Yes, I'm aware.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.880
And the Glee Club
sort of dealt with that whole

16:58.970 --> 17:00.150
boys singing songs
that are meant for girls.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.690
Oh.
It's kind of old news.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.610
Then you must know that that song was done

17:03.670 --> 17:05.980
to great fanfare by
such Broadway legends as.

17:06.030 --> 17:08.859
Merman, LuPone, Bernadette.

17:08.950 --> 17:10.849
Those are some awfully big heels to fill,

17:10.910 --> 17:13.030
and I'm just not quite sure
that you nailed it.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.540
Usually, at this point,
the reality show would

17:19.619 --> 17:21.910
go to commercial, then we would
take a five minute break

17:21.990 --> 17:23.859
to regroup and get touch-ups
done on our makeup.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.579
So I'm gonna hit the little boys' room.

17:25.660 --> 17:26.800
You're doing a great job, though.

17:26.859 --> 17:28.700
I really think that
you should comment more.

17:28.770 --> 17:30.630
Don't be shy.

17:34.490 --> 17:37.280
Jessie St. James
totally Jessie St. Sucks.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.080
He said I shouldn't be singing girl songs.

17:39.170 --> 17:41.500
I make my living singing girl songs.

17:41.570 --> 17:43.370
I think the winner of four
show choir championships

17:43.420 --> 17:45.400
might be able to give us all
some valuable insight.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.040
We know you're in love with him, Rachel,

17:47.090 --> 17:48.670
but do you have to be so obvious?

17:48.740 --> 17:51.040
Don't use the fact that
Jessie and I once had feelings

17:51.090 --> 17:53.510
for each other as an excuse
for my inevitable win.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.250
Correction:
You had feelings for him,

17:55.300 --> 17:56.630
he made breakfast on your head.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.970
Look, Jessie and I both
appreciate the integrity

17:59.050 --> 18:01.220
of show choir too much
to soil the competition.

18:01.270 --> 18:03.110
He's just gonna vote for whoever is best.

18:03.190 --> 18:04.970
That would be me. You guys
can fight over who's gonna

18:05.060 --> 18:06.860
come in second all you want,
because I kicked that song

18:06.930 --> 18:07.860
square in the balls.

18:07.930 --> 18:09.030
I'm so gonna win this thing.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.280
No bother warming up, Rachel.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.600
I'm about to go out there
and wrap this thing up

18:12.650 --> 18:13.770
like a Christmas present.

18:26.050 --> 18:30.550
* Oh, she may get weary *

18:30.620 --> 18:35.000
* Them young girls...
they do get wearied *

18:35.090 --> 18:42.400
* Wearing that same old shaggy dress *

18:42.460 --> 18:45.130
* Yeah *

18:45.180 --> 18:50.770
* But when she gets weary *

18:50.820 --> 18:58.160
* Try a little tenderness *

18:58.250 --> 19:03.000
* Oh, maybe, Mmm *

19:05.000 --> 19:08.840
* You won't regret it, no *

19:08.920 --> 19:12.170
* Young girls...
they don't forget it *

19:12.260 --> 19:17.160
* Love is their whole happiness *

19:17.210 --> 19:19.720
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

19:22.270 --> 19:26.310
* But it's all so easy *

19:26.360 --> 19:29.780
* All you got to do is try *

19:29.840 --> 19:32.450
* Try a little tenderness *

19:32.510 --> 19:36.400
* Yeah, all youot to do isman *

19:36.470 --> 19:38.880
* Hold her where you want her *

19:38.950 --> 19:41.570
* Squeeze her, don'tease her *

19:41.640 --> 19:43.470
* Never leave her *

19:43.560 --> 19:46.540
* Get to her, got to try *

19:46.610 --> 19:52.200
* Try a little nderness *

19:52.270 --> 19:56.220
* Oh, yeah *

19:56.290 --> 19:58.870
* Squeeze her, don'tease her *

19:58.940 --> 20:00.620
* Never leave her *

20:00.720 --> 20:04.840
* Try, try, try, yeah *

20:04.910 --> 20:07.860
* Tenderness *

20:07.930 --> 20:09.300
* Oh, yeah *

20:09.370 --> 20:13.540
* You got to, you got to, yeah, yeah *

20:13.600 --> 20:15.390
* Rub her gentle, man *

20:15.440 --> 20:17.110
* Don't bruise her, no, no *

20:17.160 --> 20:21.190
* You g to loveer, tease r, squee her, ye *

20:21.260 --> 20:25.920

Wow, Mercedes!

Just... wow.

20:30.050 --> 20:31.350
You know, seeing you up there

20:31.420 --> 20:32.860
brought me back to the first time

20:32.940 --> 20:33.920
you auditioned for Glee Club.

20:33.990 --> 20:34.860
You were great back then,

20:34.940 --> 20:37.060
but you were just amazing now.

20:37.130 --> 20:38.640
Thank you for singing that.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.310
And thank you for reminding me
where we started,

20:41.370 --> 20:44.230
and where we're going to now:
Nationals.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.480
Thank you, Mr. Shue.

20:45.550 --> 20:46.900
I couldn't have done it without you.

20:46.970 --> 20:49.740
You're not a star, you're just
a girl who can really sing.

20:49.820 --> 20:50.890
Ex-Excuse me?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.190
I don't think you want this

20:52.260 --> 20:53.390
badly enough, Mercedes.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.230
How many times did you practice that song?

20:55.300 --> 20:56.550
Practice?

20:56.610 --> 20:59.880
No, I feel my material,
and I sing with emotion.

20:59.970 --> 21:02.050
I'm in the moment,
Mr. St. James.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.350
I don't need to practice.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.650
Actually, you do.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.560
And how long did you
work on that choreography?

21:07.620 --> 21:09.840
Oh, wait, there was none.

21:09.890 --> 21:11.810
You're lazy, Mercedes.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.350
Not too lazy to come up there
and let you taste my fist!

21:14.410 --> 21:15.550
Whoever gets this solo

21:15.620 --> 21:17.550
is gonna have to work on it day and night.

21:17.620 --> 21:19.320
Do you think you're ready for that?

21:19.390 --> 21:20.920
I do.
I don't.

21:28.750 --> 21:29.800
I hate him.

21:31.730 --> 21:33.350
Hi. My name is Rachel Berry,

21:33.420 --> 21:35.990
and I'll be singing the most
difficult song I've ever sung.

21:36.050 --> 21:37.250
Great. What song?

21:37.320 --> 21:39.040
Uh, Barbra's closing number

21:39.110 --> 21:41.010
to my favorite movie...
<i>Funny Girl.</i>

21:41.070 --> 21:42.290
Rachel, in your head,

21:42.380 --> 21:44.010
are you singing to anyone in particular?

21:44.080 --> 21:46.410
Not really.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.400
Oh.

21:52.090 --> 21:56.190
* Oh, my man, I love him so *

21:58.060 --> 21:59.810
* He'll never know *

22:02.100 --> 22:05.060
* All my life is just despair *

22:06.470 --> 22:10.120
* But I don't care *

22:10.190 --> 22:15.120
* When he takes me in his arms *

22:15.190 --> 22:18.960
* The world is bright *

22:21.060 --> 22:24.000
* All right *

22:27.220 --> 22:31.760
* What's the difference if I say *

22:31.810 --> 22:34.230
* I'll go away *

22:37.260 --> 22:40.480
* When I know I'll come back *

22:40.570 --> 22:44.490
* On my knee someday? *

22:44.550 --> 22:48.340
* For whatever my man is *

22:48.410 --> 22:51.160
* I am his *

22:51.230 --> 22:57.050
* Forevermore *

22:57.120 --> 23:02.150
* Oh, my man, I love him so *

23:02.210 --> 23:05.270
* He'll never know *

23:05.340 --> 23:07.980
* All my life is just despair *

23:08.040 --> 23:11.550
* But I don't care *

23:11.630 --> 23:15.680
* When he takes me in his arms *

23:15.770 --> 23:19.510
* The world is bright *

23:19.570 --> 23:25.190
* All right *

23:25.280 --> 23:28.880
* What's the difference if I say *

23:28.930 --> 23:31.600
* I'll go away *

23:31.690 --> 23:33.890
* When I know I'll come back *

23:33.940 --> 23:38.490
* On my knee someday? *

23:38.560 --> 23:42.780
* For whatever my man is *

23:42.860 --> 23:45.660
* I am his *

23:45.730 --> 23:53.540
* Forevermore. *.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.920
She may be difficult,
but boy, can she sing.

24:08.970 --> 24:10.770
Bravo!

24:11.920 --> 24:12.760
I have to be honest.

24:14.740 --> 24:16.060
That was brilliant.

24:16.110 --> 24:18.580
I have nothing but the tip of my hat.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.170
Garbage. This whole
thing is rigged.

24:20.230 --> 24:22.820
Hold on, Santana.
Like I said before, I make

24:22.900 --> 24:23.900
the final call here.
Well, then, make it.

24:25.770 --> 24:27.540
Out of respect to you all,

24:27.610 --> 24:29.460
I'm going to take a couple days

24:29.540 --> 24:30.710
and consider all the results.

24:30.780 --> 24:33.450
Now, I will let you all know by Friday.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.130
Great job, everyone.

24:39.470 --> 24:42.290
We sorted Jean's stuff into piles.

24:42.340 --> 24:44.470
Over there are some old
magazines and newspapers

24:44.560 --> 24:45.670
that you can just toss out.
And this is stuff

24:45.760 --> 24:47.480
you're definitely going to want to keep.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.090
Uh, photos and stuffed animals.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.400
And this third pile is stuff

24:50.460 --> 24:52.260
that we don't really know what to do with.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.470
Um...
Pom-pom.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.800
Toss it.
It's not worth anything.

24:55.850 --> 24:57.320
Are you sure?

24:57.400 --> 24:58.900
<i>Willy Wonka</i>
<i>and the Chocolate Factory.</i>

24:58.970 --> 25:00.320
Oh, I love that movie.

25:00.410 --> 25:02.440
Then, you can take it.
It's probably worn out.

25:02.490 --> 25:04.610
She watched it at least three times a week.

25:07.830 --> 25:08.950
Just toss it all out.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.200
What?

25:10.280 --> 25:12.370
You heard me. It's all junk.

25:12.450 --> 25:14.540
I'll take the stuffed animal.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.760
Jean's had this since she was six.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.040
Everything else, just toss
it out; I don't need it.

25:20.130 --> 25:21.460
But there are a lot of memories here.

25:21.510 --> 25:23.460
You know, I'm not short
on memories of my sister, so...

25:23.510 --> 25:25.210
I know what it's like

25:25.300 --> 25:26.880
to lose someone.

25:26.970 --> 25:28.770
When someone dies, it hurts.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.800
Very astute, Porcelain.

25:30.850 --> 25:33.970
That's a little nugget of wisdom
I'd really like to jot down.

25:34.020 --> 25:35.440
Coach Sylvester, we're just trying to help.

25:35.510 --> 25:37.180
You know what, Cottage Cheese?
You're not helping.

25:37.230 --> 25:38.560
You're actually making things worse.

25:38.630 --> 25:41.230
So do me a favor and take
all this stuff to the Dumpster

25:41.310 --> 25:43.320
on your way to the rehearsal
for whatever treacly ballad

25:43.370 --> 25:45.230
you're planning on using
to ruin my sister's funeral.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.120
Why did you agree to this, then?

25:47.190 --> 25:48.850
If you hate us so much, then why

25:48.910 --> 25:50.460
are you letting the Glee Club
plan the service?

25:50.520 --> 25:52.190
I was afraid no one would come.

25:53.910 --> 25:56.630
Jean didn't know a lot of people.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.660
I figured, with the Glee Club there,

25:58.720 --> 26:01.200
at least she'd have a full house.

26:17.540 --> 26:19.290
Hey, Sue.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.090
You look nice.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.740
Thank you for coming.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.290
Jean always stood up for you

26:24.380 --> 26:26.750
when I told her stories about
how evil your hair was.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.350
Did anyone come?

26:31.420 --> 26:32.950
It's a full house, actually.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.610
Workers from the home,

26:34.690 --> 26:36.610
other residents, their families.

26:36.690 --> 26:38.730
Your sister touched a lot of people.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.140
What do you think, Coach Sylvester?

27:05.220 --> 27:06.970
You told us that <i>Willy Wonka</i>

27:07.060 --> 27:08.890
was Jean's favorite movie.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.480
The way you described Jean
made her sound so special,

27:12.560 --> 27:15.950
so we wanted her funeral
to be special, also.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.150
Something to capture and express

27:17.230 --> 27:18.650
the Joy of her life,

27:18.730 --> 27:20.820
rather than the sadness of her death.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.100
It's lovely.

27:23.150 --> 27:24.570
Let's sit.

27:28.930 --> 27:31.560
Welcome to the most unusual funeral

27:31.630 --> 27:33.160
that I have ever attended.

27:33.250 --> 27:37.420
Which makes sense, because Jean
was the most unusual person

27:37.490 --> 27:40.290
that I ever had the pleasure
to spend every Sunday

27:40.360 --> 27:41.960
for the last 30 years with.

27:42.020 --> 27:47.540
I think that Jean's sister Sue
would like to say a few words.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.110
I miss my sister.

28:09.230 --> 28:11.950
Every night, at 10:00 or so,

28:12.020 --> 28:14.570
she used to call me on the phone,

28:14.660 --> 28:19.540
and when I asked her why...

28:19.630 --> 28:24.500
She'd tell me that her body told her...

28:24.550 --> 28:27.530
She wanted to hear my voice.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.890
Hey...

28:37.980 --> 28:39.730
I'll read it.

28:48.070 --> 28:49.340
"I miss my sister.

28:50.690 --> 28:52.490
"The smell of her shampoo.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.410
"The way she could always convince me

28:54.500 --> 28:56.110
to read her
another book."

28:57.900 --> 29:00.830
"When you love someone like I loved her,

29:00.900 --> 29:02.720
"they're a part of you.

29:02.790 --> 29:05.190
"It's like you're attached
by this invisible tether,

29:05.260 --> 29:07.040
"and no matter how far away you are,

29:07.090 --> 29:09.580
"you can always feel them.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.600
"And now, every time
I reach for that tether,

29:13.670 --> 29:16.180
"I know there's no one on the other end,

29:16.250 --> 29:18.600
"and I feel like I'm falling
into nothingness.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.360
"Then I remember Jean.

29:21.420 --> 29:24.190
"I remember a life led with no enemies,

29:24.260 --> 29:27.780
"no resentments, no regrets...
and I'm inspired...

29:27.860 --> 29:31.350
"to get up out of bed and go on.

29:31.420 --> 29:33.980
"I miss my sister so much.

29:34.050 --> 29:36.990
"It feels like a piece of me
has been ripped off.

29:38.490 --> 29:42.240
"Just one more time, I want to hold her.

29:42.290 --> 29:45.000
"Ten more seconds...
is that too much to ask?

29:45.080 --> 29:47.910
"For ten more seconds to hold her?

29:47.970 --> 29:51.280
"But I can't

29:51.340 --> 29:54.120
"and I won't,

29:54.170 --> 29:57.060
"and the only thing keeping me

29:57.120 --> 29:59.640
"from being swallowed whole by sadness

29:59.730 --> 30:03.900
"is that Jean would kill me if I did.

30:03.960 --> 30:07.850
"So, for now, I'm just going to miss her.

30:09.070 --> 30:10.300
"I love you, Jeanie.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.270
Rest in peace."

30:25.200 --> 30:27.220
This was Jean's favorite song.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.630
Hold your breath.
Make a wish.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.760
Count to three.

30:40.070 --> 30:43.770
* Come with me *

30:43.840 --> 30:46.670
* And you'll be *

30:49.060 --> 30:51.360
* In a world *

30:51.450 --> 30:56.180
* Of pure imagination *

30:56.230 --> 30:58.870
* Take a look *

30:58.940 --> 31:02.290
* And you'll see *

31:02.360 --> 31:06.790
* Into your imagination *

31:13.330 --> 31:17.020
* We'll begin *

31:17.090 --> 31:19.840
* With a spin *

31:19.890 --> 31:25.350
* Traveling in the world of my creation *

31:25.400 --> 31:27.710
* What we'll see *

31:27.770 --> 31:30.100
* Will defy *

31:30.180 --> 31:36.220
* Explanation *

31:36.270 --> 31:40.780
* If you want to view paradise *

31:40.860 --> 31:45.670
* Simply look around and view it *

31:45.730 --> 31:50.750
* Anything you want to, do it *

31:50.820 --> 31:54.210
* Want to change the world *

31:54.260 --> 31:58.510
* There's nothing to it *

32:01.350 --> 32:05.220
* There is no *

32:05.270 --> 32:08.810
* Life I know *

32:08.890 --> 32:14.310
* To compare with pure imagination *

32:14.400 --> 32:19.620
* Living there, you'll be free *

32:19.700 --> 32:27.120
* If you truly... *

32:29.430 --> 32:39.140
* Wish to be. *.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.090
Thank you.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.310
Sorry.
Long line in the restroom.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.780
Everyone was fixing their mascara.

33:03.830 --> 33:05.660
Mm.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.950
You did such a great job with the funeral.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.500
I'm so proud of you.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.820
Why are you crying?

33:13.890 --> 33:16.120
Because I'm breaking up with you.

33:17.490 --> 33:19.330
Because of Rachel?

33:20.540 --> 33:22.300
'Cause you still love her?

33:22.350 --> 33:24.210
I shouldn't have done this with you.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.880
I thought that I could fix

33:25.950 --> 33:28.940
everything from last year, but I...

33:29.000 --> 33:30.970
I can't.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.020
I just can't, and

33:33.110 --> 33:36.530
that feeling that Sue was
talking about in there of being

33:36.610 --> 33:39.850
tethered to someone...
I... I just...

33:39.900 --> 33:42.200
I don't feel that way about you.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.180
But you do with her?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.950
No.

33:48.020 --> 33:49.740
We're not breaking up.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.630
I can handle your confusion with Rachel

33:51.690 --> 33:53.240
until you get over it.

33:53.330 --> 33:54.580
We're gonna stay together,

33:54.660 --> 33:56.860
and next year,
we'll be prom king and queen...

33:56.910 --> 33:57.910
Just stop it.

33:59.030 --> 34:00.530
Okay? I don't want that life.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.700
Don't you feel anything anymore?

34:04.770 --> 34:06.690
This is real.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.060
This is happening.

34:14.270 --> 34:16.179
Are you happy now?

34:18.070 --> 34:19.739
Is this me feeling enough for you?

34:19.820 --> 34:21.889
Quinn, I'm sorry.
I still love you.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.020
Just don't touch me!

34:41.610 --> 34:42.780
Action.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.380
Well, it was a tough competition,

34:44.429 --> 34:45.110
but here's the dope.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.780
Santana... too mean.
Kurt... too controversial.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.110
Mercedes... I said it twice,
and I'll say it again.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.610
Lazy B-O-N-E-S.

34:52.670 --> 34:54.000
Rachel is the clear winner.

34:54.030 --> 34:56.530
I'm really not comfortable
having this conversation taped.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.120
Well, I can't practice reality
show judging without a camera.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.700
It's like practicing skiing without skis.

35:00.770 --> 35:02.070
I've totally done that.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.040
Okay, Brittany, can you
just turn that thing off?

35:04.110 --> 35:06.240
Just the off switch... right...
right over there. Just...

35:06.290 --> 35:07.440
Yeah, I know how
to turn it off. Thanks.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.710
Okay. It's cool.

35:09.780 --> 35:11.620
Jessie, maybe you can come on.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.080
<i>Fondue for Two</i> and judge my Cat.

35:13.150 --> 35:16.000
Rock and roll.
I have to be honest, Jessie.

35:16.090 --> 35:17.390
The more we talk about this,

35:17.460 --> 35:18.640
the more uncomfortable
I feel about all of it.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.060
It just feels like I'm telling

35:20.120 --> 35:21.640
one of my children
that they're my favorite.

35:21.730 --> 35:23.580
Well, that's what my parents
told me in front of my siblings.

35:23.650 --> 35:24.610
Sure, some might say that it led

35:24.680 --> 35:26.430
to my brother's whippet addiction

35:26.500 --> 35:29.130
and my sister's bulimia, but
my parents owed them the truth.

35:31.140 --> 35:34.270
You really think picking Rachel
means we beat Vocal Adrenaline?

35:34.320 --> 35:35.840
It's in the bag.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.610
Coach, can I come in?

35:41.660 --> 35:43.860
Hello, Becky.

35:43.950 --> 35:48.290
I'm turning in my pom-poms
and the megaphone

35:48.340 --> 35:49.820
that you got me.

35:49.870 --> 35:52.340
I'll miss our time together...

35:52.420 --> 35:54.660
I'm gonna stop you right there, Becky.

35:54.710 --> 35:57.260
Have you ever heard of menopause?

35:57.330 --> 36:00.100
Well, I fired you in a hormonal fury

36:00.160 --> 36:03.680
I like to call womb rage, and I apologize.

36:03.770 --> 36:06.100
Now I'd like you to
pick up those pom-poms

36:06.170 --> 36:07.350
and that megaphone.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.940
You know why?

36:09.010 --> 36:11.480
Next year, you're Captain of the Cheerios!

36:11.530 --> 36:13.390
Oh, my gosh, thanks, Coach!

36:14.360 --> 36:15.610
Got to call my mom!

36:15.680 --> 36:17.530
Uh, hold it right there.

36:17.620 --> 36:19.530
I'm not finished.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.150
I want you to give me a hug.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.740
Come here.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.140
That seat taken?

36:40.200 --> 36:42.040
No.

36:46.260 --> 36:48.810
William, I have to say something.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.180
In the history of our relationship,

36:50.250 --> 36:52.830
I've said many things to you,

36:52.900 --> 36:54.970
but there's one thing I've never said.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.220
Good luck.

36:57.290 --> 36:59.320
You know, I spent all this time hating you,

36:59.390 --> 37:00.660
and hating that Glee Club.

37:00.730 --> 37:02.880
I do this thing where I sort of alternate

37:02.940 --> 37:04.860
which one of those kids I hate the most.

37:04.930 --> 37:06.580
Right now, it's the dancing Asian.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.550
But after what you did for my sister,

37:08.620 --> 37:11.840
I just can't do it anymore.

37:11.900 --> 37:15.540
You have something Jean
had that I do not have.

37:17.010 --> 37:19.180
A pure heart.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.710
You're a very good friend, William,

37:20.780 --> 37:22.910
and I have not been that to you.

37:22.980 --> 37:24.130
Yeah, you really haven't.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.850
So, it's time for a change.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.420
Starting today, I will no longer
be going after the Glee Club.

37:28.470 --> 37:31.100
Frankly, I have bigger fish to fry.

37:31.190 --> 37:33.560
I'm running for the United
States House of Representatives.

37:35.780 --> 37:37.110
I'm... I'm sorry.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.460
What-What did you say?

37:38.530 --> 37:40.360
In the last year of her life,

37:40.430 --> 37:42.480
Jean faced ballooning health care costs

37:42.550 --> 37:45.600
and cuts to her disability payments.

37:45.650 --> 37:48.240
Well, the Sue Sylvester
American Liberty Party thinks

37:48.290 --> 37:50.840
that's a load of phooey.

37:50.910 --> 37:52.660
There is one slight problem.

37:52.740 --> 37:56.410
In a fit of pique, I rerouted
the Glee Club's plane to Libya.

37:56.480 --> 37:57.660
Wait... what?!

37:57.730 --> 37:58.830
It took some effort.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.800
It was a long fit of pique.

38:00.870 --> 38:03.340
I had some help... Panda Express
really came through for me.

38:03.420 --> 38:04.860
So we're not going to New York?

38:04.920 --> 38:06.590
I can explain that.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.890
Will, I'm gonna leave you two alone,

38:10.960 --> 38:12.480
as this just became super awkward.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.850
These are first-class tickets
on American Airlines.

38:15.930 --> 38:17.270
How did you afford them?

38:17.320 --> 38:19.150
Well, do you know that if you complain

38:19.240 --> 38:20.850
to the airline about contracting monkey pox

38:20.940 --> 38:22.520
in the bathroom on the plane,

38:22.610 --> 38:24.440
you can get the president of the airline

38:24.490 --> 38:25.910
on the phone within an hour?

38:25.980 --> 38:27.490
But you didn't?
No, of course not.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.360
Have you been on their planes?
They're immaculate.

38:29.450 --> 38:31.750
No, it turns out that one
of the vice presidents

38:31.820 --> 38:33.320
of American Airlines is a big supporter

38:33.370 --> 38:34.530
of the arts or something,

38:34.620 --> 38:36.870
so when I told him
your Glee Club's sob story,

38:36.950 --> 38:38.510
he gladly came up with the tickets

38:38.590 --> 38:40.040
for you guys to make it happen.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.710
This is amazing, Terri.

38:42.790 --> 38:44.710
Wait.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.680
What's the catch?

38:46.760 --> 38:48.430
I'm moving to Miami.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.830
Sheets N' Things is opening
a new branch down there,

38:50.890 --> 38:52.470
and they have asked me to manage it.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.220
Like, full on manager?

38:54.310 --> 38:57.520
The assistant title is officially dropped.

38:57.610 --> 38:59.840
Look, Will, I know that I made your life...

38:59.890 --> 39:03.230
Challenging sometimes, but...

39:05.480 --> 39:07.780
...it was only because
I loved you so much.

39:07.850 --> 39:09.990
I loved you, too.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.020
We just weren't right.

39:13.490 --> 39:14.460
No regrets, though.

39:14.530 --> 39:16.540
No. Not one.

39:22.220 --> 39:24.250
Just try to relax a little bit while

39:24.340 --> 39:25.640
you're down there, okay?

39:25.700 --> 39:26.890
Oh. Yeah.
I mean, you deserve

39:26.970 --> 39:27.670
to enjoy yourself.

39:27.720 --> 39:29.260
Okay.

39:29.340 --> 39:31.210
Okay.

39:33.340 --> 39:35.380
I'll see you around, Will.

39:40.350 --> 39:41.570
Hey.
Hey.

39:41.650 --> 39:43.550
Is everything okay with Terri?

39:43.600 --> 39:45.110
Yeah. Finally.

39:45.190 --> 39:46.690
It is.

39:46.740 --> 39:49.060
Is... Are you wearing
one of my old vests?

39:49.110 --> 39:51.610
Yeah, I didn't have the
heart to throw it away.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.280
Emma, this isn't forever.

39:54.370 --> 39:57.120
I hope it is.

39:57.190 --> 39:59.750
Really, Will, you deserve this.

39:59.840 --> 40:03.160
You've given so much for so long,

40:03.220 --> 40:05.290
and now it's your turn.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.880
But, um, don't be a stranger, okay?

40:12.380 --> 40:14.130
Thank you.

40:27.930 --> 40:28.900
Jessie?

40:28.950 --> 40:30.270
That's sweet.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.100
You remember the masculine
click of my designer boots.

40:32.150 --> 40:33.450
Okay, why did you ask me

40:33.540 --> 40:34.790
to meet you here right
before the list goes up?

40:34.870 --> 40:36.070
Is this good news, or is it bad news?

40:36.120 --> 40:38.210
Rachel, I did wrong by you last year,

40:38.280 --> 40:40.580
and I came back to make that wrong right.

40:40.630 --> 40:42.380
And I came here to tell you

40:42.450 --> 40:44.820
that you're going
to be the featured soloist

40:44.880 --> 40:46.220
at Nationals in New York.

40:46.280 --> 40:47.550
Wait, wait. How do you know?

40:47.620 --> 40:48.720
Did Mr. Schuester tell you?

40:48.790 --> 40:49.970
Let it suffice to say

40:50.050 --> 40:51.620
that I was very involved in the decision.

40:53.890 --> 40:55.460
Oh.

40:58.510 --> 41:00.350
No. I-I... I feel bad.

41:00.430 --> 41:01.970
Everyone else worked so hard.

41:02.020 --> 41:03.850
Now they're just going to hate me.

41:03.940 --> 41:05.820
They sort of already do, and

41:05.900 --> 41:07.350
you know as well as I

41:07.440 --> 41:09.570
that sometimes that's the price of fame.

41:11.750 --> 41:15.370
I used to think that fame was
the only thing that mattered.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.250
And now I realize that there's something

41:17.310 --> 41:18.770
that matters to me more.

41:18.860 --> 41:20.930
What?

41:20.990 --> 41:22.480
You.

41:30.030 --> 41:31.380
Come on.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.570
I think the list is posted.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.380
This doesn't make any sense.

41:43.470 --> 41:44.970
Guys, it was a tough decision,

41:45.040 --> 41:46.300
but it's for the good of the club.

41:46.370 --> 41:47.470
Although this is deeply personal,

41:47.540 --> 41:48.870
try not to take it personally.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.890
Um, you guys might want
to read what the list says.

41:51.980 --> 41:53.310
What? Why?

41:58.770 --> 42:01.150
Oh, Mr. Shue,
thank God you're here

42:01.220 --> 42:02.820
to put these trolls out of their
misery. Can you just announce

42:02.890 --> 42:04.520
my win so that I can get on
with teasing the losers?

42:04.570 --> 42:05.720
I heard your performance, Santana.

42:05.770 --> 42:07.240
This is mine, and you know it.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.890
See, Jessie? This is
the kind of infighting

42:08.940 --> 42:10.830
and "me first" attitudes
that I wanted to avoid.

42:10.890 --> 42:12.660
What you call infighting,
I call motivation.

42:12.730 --> 42:14.500
And this is just the beginning.
Once we get to Nationals,

42:14.560 --> 42:16.620
I'll have them willing to kill
each other for that solo.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.170
No.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.870
I've changed my mind.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.340
We're going back to what got us here...

42:23.410 --> 42:25.570
Original songs sung by the entire club.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.630
We're a team,

42:27.710 --> 42:29.630
and we're best when we work as one.

42:29.710 --> 42:30.550
You're going to lose.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.350
Whatever we do,

42:32.420 --> 42:34.520
we're going to do it together.

42:34.580 --> 42:37.750
Actually, Santana, you sounded pretty good.

42:37.810 --> 42:40.140
Thanks. You guys were all
pretty dope, too.

42:40.220 --> 42:41.720
Even Rachel.

42:41.780 --> 42:43.430
I wish I could sound like you do, Santana.

42:43.480 --> 42:44.810
I mean, how do you get that raspiness?

42:44.900 --> 42:47.110
So nice. I smoke cigars.

42:47.180 --> 42:48.780
All right, guys, time to get to work.

42:48.870 --> 42:50.200
Now, I want two hit songs

42:50.270 --> 42:52.450
by the time the wheels
touch down at JFK. Come on.

42:55.910 --> 42:59.960
Hey. Thanks.
For what?

43:00.040 --> 43:01.880
I know you're hurting right now,

43:01.950 --> 43:04.880
but it's really cool
you didn't quit Glee Club.

43:04.950 --> 43:06.350
If I quit Glee Club, my big plans

43:06.420 --> 43:07.470
for New York would have been ruined.

43:07.530 --> 43:09.120
What plans?
You'll see.
