somethin' on Instagram.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.767

Yeah, so, that's your theme.
That's what you do.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.767
- Yeah, because
I'm-I'm not good

03:34.000 --> 03:35.400
at expressing myself
sometimes.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.500

"Why don't you say

Well, I-I feel like,

03:41.500 --> 03:42.600

- Mm-hmm.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.266
- Like, the dynamics.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.200
I thought I was
developing relationships
with certain people,

03:46.233 --> 03:48.200
and then it's like,

03:48.233 --> 03:49.467
okay, but a friend
wouldn't do that.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.734

who did you feel--

03:50.767 --> 03:51.734

and it's just weird.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.166
[laughing]
Oh, yeah.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.266
- Because I really thought
that we were getting to, like,

03:57.300 --> 04:00.200
a cool place, but then
we get in front of the room,

04:00.233 --> 04:02.433

"Hey, are you shady?"

04:02.467 --> 04:04.166
Since hibachi night,

04:04.200 --> 04:06.266
I have been
extremely conflicted.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.533
- Eva, you caught
that shade,

04:07.567 --> 04:09.000
but you be forgettin'
your shade.

04:09.033 --> 04:10.300
- Ut-oh.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.700
- Have you ever been shady
with Cynthia?

04:12.734 --> 04:14.400
- So, Kandi, help me.

04:14.433 --> 04:15.567
Explain to me.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.767
Sensei, teach me.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.633
What should do
in this situation?

04:18.667 --> 04:20.700
Like, it's a full SOS.

04:20.734 --> 04:22.200
- I don't know.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.400
I mean, I, myself, I've
been through that with her.

04:23.433 --> 04:25.400
I mean, when me
and her first met,

04:25.433 --> 04:26.467
I was being friends
with her.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.533
- Y'all was cool.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.033
- We was cool, and then,
all of a sudden,

04:29.066 --> 04:30.500
I felt like she started
shading the sh-- out of me.

04:30.533 --> 04:32.700
[laughing]
So, it's like--

04:32.734 --> 04:33.700
- But where does it
come from?

04:33.734 --> 04:35.233
- I don't know.

04:35.266 --> 04:36.367
- Like, when do you know
when the switch is gonna flip?

04:36.400 --> 04:37.367
- It's so weird.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.600
I don't understand
her sometimes.

04:38.633 --> 04:42.333
I feel like anything
that you are feeling,

04:42.367 --> 04:44.000
uh, you need to address it

04:44.033 --> 04:46.700
because when the communication
is not there,

04:46.734 --> 04:48.333
stuff just gets worse.
- Yeah.

04:48.367 --> 04:51.233
- I know that some of
the girls feel like

04:51.266 --> 04:54.266
you say one thing when
the people aren't around,

04:54.300 --> 04:56.033
and then when people
are around,

04:56.066 --> 04:58.333
then you don't say
that same thing,

04:58.367 --> 05:01.367
or you may
play it down.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.533
- Oh, not the
veteran walk.

05:04.567 --> 05:05.600
- Yes.

05:05.633 --> 05:06.734
[laughing]

05:06.767 --> 05:07.667
- You never said
she was like

05:07.700 --> 05:09.633
the mother of the den?
- When?

05:09.667 --> 05:12.066
- When we were at the gym.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.066
- No shade--
I'm gon' pass the peach.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.633
Here, Sham--
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.300
So, you didn't say
I needed a makeover?

05:19.333 --> 05:20.367
- No.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.433
- I did not.
No, no, no.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.333
- My girl, Eva,
I love you to death,

05:25.367 --> 05:27.233
but sometimes
you do things

05:27.266 --> 05:29.333
that are taken
as shade,

05:29.367 --> 05:31.533
and I feel like
sometimes you could just

05:31.567 --> 05:34.567
own it and move on.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.100
But, at the same time,
it's just like,

05:36.133 --> 05:37.300
if you were saying it
as a joke,

05:37.333 --> 05:38.533
you shoulda just said it
to Cynthia

05:38.567 --> 05:40.500
because, obviously,
when you say it to anybody

05:40.533 --> 05:41.734
when that person
is not around,

05:41.767 --> 05:43.066
they come back
and twist it.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.633
- What friend does that?

05:44.667 --> 05:48.633
- Hey, man, if somebody
come at you with the drama,

05:48.667 --> 05:50.433
you gotta deal with it
right then.

05:50.467 --> 05:51.667

- Why?

07:32.066 --> 07:34.500
- I haven't even found
anything to wear.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.433
My only thing is, like,
the hours, the flight,

07:36.467 --> 07:37.700
how it long it is.

07:37.734 --> 07:40.367
And I'm about to be out of
my first trimester. So--

07:40.400 --> 07:41.467
- Oh, that's good.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.734
- I've already told
most of my family.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.667
So, really, the only people
who don't know

07:44.700 --> 07:46.367
are the rest of
the girls.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.166
- I'm sure they'll
be happy for you

07:48.200 --> 07:49.233
and everything.

07:49.266 --> 07:50.567
- Yeah, so, I wanna do
somethin', like,

07:50.600 --> 07:51.700
when we get there.

07:51.734 --> 07:52.734
- Like, an announcement?
- Like, announce.

07:52.767 --> 07:53.734
Like, tell the rest
of the girls.

07:53.767 --> 07:54.467

Okay, okay.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500

07:55.533 --> 07:57.133
Now that I've passed
the danger zone

07:57.166 --> 07:58.600
of when you're not supposed to
tell people you're pregnant,

07:58.633 --> 08:01.033
I feel comfortable enough
now to let the girls in

08:01.066 --> 08:02.100
on the secret.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.600
Plus, I barely got past
the Destin trip

08:04.633 --> 08:05.667
without them knowing.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.367
So, yeah, I definitely
need to go ahead

08:07.400 --> 08:08.433

08:08.467 --> 08:09.767

the last time you

08:10.000 --> 08:14.734

was at Tanya's.

08:14.767 --> 08:15.734

- Oh, it ain't
serious to me.

41:09.767 --> 41:12.700
- I'm upset because this
is a woman who calls me.

41:12.734 --> 41:14.233
We're supposed
to be friends.

41:14.266 --> 41:16.100
Sometimes it makes me sit up
and go, yeah, okay,

41:16.133 --> 41:17.533
I really do have to
plan this wedding.

41:17.567 --> 41:18.667
- No, you don't.

41:18.700 --> 41:19.767
You shouldn't get married

41:20.000 --> 41:21.133
based off of what
somebody else feel.

41:21.166 --> 41:22.233
- Yeah.

41:22.266 --> 41:24.066
And then now she's
saying things like,

41:24.100 --> 41:26.100
"Oh, maybe you'll
marry somebody else."

41:26.133 --> 41:28.100
It's bad juju.
It's negative.

41:28.133 --> 41:30.166
So, I don't really know
who NeNe is, right now.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.266
Like...

41:32.300 --> 41:33.467
- I don't care if y'all
are married or not.

41:33.500 --> 41:34.633
Like, that-- I'm not into it.
- I do, though.

41:34.667 --> 41:36.000
- But I don't, okay?

41:36.033 --> 41:37.367
So, please don't think
I'm questioning you

41:37.400 --> 41:39.133
about your marriage 'cause
now I want you to be happy.

41:39.166 --> 41:40.533
- Thank you.
- But I do not care.

41:40.567 --> 41:42.667
- All I'm saying, is the joke
in the spiritual temple--

41:42.700 --> 41:44.400
- It was not a joke.
- I get it.

41:44.433 --> 41:46.033
- I've been married over
20-somethin' years,

41:46.066 --> 41:48.000
so I'm very serious
about love, okay?

41:48.033 --> 41:49.200
- Exactly, and I appreciate
it not being a joke.

41:49.233 --> 41:50.700
- If you took it personal,
too bad, okay?

41:50.734 --> 41:52.066
- I did.
I kind of did.

41:52.100 --> 41:53.166
'Cause I was like, whoa,
why are you wishing

41:53.200 --> 41:54.367
I'm marrying
someone else?

41:54.400 --> 41:57.066
- Girl, I'm not wishing
a mother----ing thing.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.767
I don't give a (BLEEP).

42:05.033 --> 42:07.767
- Next time, on "The Real
Housewives of Atlanta"...

42:08.000 --> 42:09.767
Paul is not on my radar.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.567
- He's on mine, though.
- That's good!

42:11.600 --> 42:13.700
Give me 50 feet
on Paul, now.

42:13.734 --> 42:17.266
- Uh, damn,
NeNe is mad as hell.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.266
- This is not
a good sign.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.667
NeNe always
picks up my call.

42:21.700 --> 42:24.100
- Respect your elders, child.
Sit in a child's place.

42:24.133 --> 42:25.233
You're a child.
- Girl, bye.

42:25.266 --> 42:26.700
Girl, I got two kids
and a husband.

42:26.734 --> 42:28.700
- You got two kids
by two different men.
