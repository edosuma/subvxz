00:00.700 --> 00:05.341
Mandatory evacuations have thousands
of Miamians fleeing hurricane Anthony.

00:05.341 --> 00:07.541
The national weather service
says to expect winds

00:07.541 --> 00:10.697
of up to 145 miles per hour.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.833
Emergency management suggest
you get to a shelter immediately

00:13.833 --> 00:16.334
to avoid getting caught in the gridlock.

00:32.194 --> 00:33.504
Hurry up!

00:33.746 --> 00:35.670
I'm trying. / Come on!

00:36.249 --> 00:38.214
- The door!
- It's not my fault we left so late.

00:38.214 --> 00:39.523
I had to secure things.

00:39.523 --> 00:41.692
Do you want a house when
we get back? / You snotty.

00:41.692 --> 00:43.491
Yeah, I wasn't the one blabbingon the phone ten minutes

00:43.491 --> 00:45.797
before a hurricane's
supposed to hit. / Oh, please!

00:45.797 --> 00:48.499
Excuse me for wanting
to make sure my mother's safe.

00:48.499 --> 00:50.061
Your mother.

00:52.457 --> 00:54.980
Your mother... She's crazy.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.998
What did you say? / I said.

00:58.638 --> 01:01.561
Oh, my god.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.498
Landfall.

01:08.855 --> 01:11.593
- We gotta get some shelter.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.459
- I cannot see a thing. Ridiculous.
- Well, just turn on the wipers.

01:17.459 --> 01:23.230
I know, I know. Okay.

01:23.230 --> 01:24.632
What was that?

01:29.887 --> 01:35.783
Miami police CSI and Miami Dade Fire rescue
apart of the evacuation process yesterday.

01:35.783 --> 01:38.508
As the city prepared for
the arrival hurricane Anthony.

01:38.508 --> 01:42.231
Every police agency in South Florida
joined the effort of avoid gridlock

01:42.231 --> 01:45.021
as to half million people left
the beaches and headed inland.

01:45.021 --> 01:48.177
Today emergency management is
still assessing the damage

01:48.177 --> 01:51.960
but initial reports estimate 10,000 to
20,000 homes destroyed

01:51.960 --> 01:55.146
and at least as many
more damages. / Hey!

01:56.968 --> 01:58.796
You and Ray junior are all right?

01:59.023 --> 02:01.486
Thank you. Your friend¡¯s
house was very comfortable

02:01.486 --> 02:04.213
- Thank you for giving us out of here.
- How's your place holding up?

02:04.213 --> 02:07.814
I did all right. Couple
shutters gone, I was lucky.

02:07.814 --> 02:09.906
Not all of us were, though.

02:09.906 --> 02:12.721
I was worried about you.
Helping people evacuate.

02:12.721 --> 02:16.341
I had a very close call
but I'm fine, thank you.

02:16.341 --> 02:18.369
How did you get that?

02:18.369 --> 02:21.335
Well, I was slow in getting my hand up.

02:21.335 --> 02:23.386
But I'm glad you're all right.

02:23.386 --> 02:25.931
It's this house right here? / Yes.

02:25.931 --> 02:27.542
Let's take a look.

02:29.026 --> 02:31.706
- You okay, Alexx?
- Doing better than our victim.

02:31.706 --> 02:34.131
He's wedged under the car.

02:39.484 --> 02:40.943
Do we know who he is?

02:40.943 --> 02:44.768
No ID, victim was running around
in a full-blown hurricane.

02:44.768 --> 02:48.407
Couple here says they hit him
with their car just as landfall hit.

02:48.407 --> 02:50.186
The hurricane puts all
three of them over there.

02:50.186 --> 02:52.651
Just precisely why evacuation
is mandatory.

02:52.651 --> 02:56.359
It's my fault, I know sir, the National Guard
wanted us to evacuate at 2:00,

02:56.359 --> 02:58.558
but I had to tie down my boat.
By the time we got out of here,

02:58.558 --> 03:00.320
I couldn't see two inches
in front of my face.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.719
Hit the guy. / Did either you or your
wife know this man?

03:02.719 --> 03:05.027
No. / But it's not like
we have block parties.

03:05.027 --> 03:07.494
I mean he could live next door.
We wouldn't know.

03:07.494 --> 03:09.550
Thank you for your help.
Alexx.

03:09.550 --> 03:14.266
Multiple contusions and
lacerations too many to count.

03:14.409 --> 03:16.671
You were just looking
for shelter, weren't you, baby?

03:16.671 --> 03:18.720
You got a point of impact?

03:19.156 --> 03:23.370
Vehicular incident, first point ofimpact's the knees, right?

03:23.779 --> 03:27.695
Guys get no impact marks
on his knees or shins.

03:27.695 --> 03:30.403
So God exhales and
everything goes sideways, huh?

03:30.403 --> 03:34.190
Wind picked up on the street
slammed him to the car.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.458
Man hits car.
There's your story.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.524
Let's be thorough on this,
Alexx, okay?

03:39.524 --> 03:42.407
Hard to tell which got him first. The hurricane or the car.

03:42.407 --> 03:45.386
Yes, that's our job sort
that out isn't it?

03:45.919 --> 03:48.981
After a category two hurricane?

03:48.981 --> 03:51.065
- Good luck.
- Thank you Alexx.

03:52.491 --> 03:54.496
We're going to need it.

04:29.943 --> 04:33.159
MIAMI
2x06 Hurricane Anthony

04:41.391 --> 04:44.299
With an initial estimate of
over $3 billion in damage,

04:44.299 --> 04:48.570
the governor has asked the president
to declare south florida a disaster area

04:48.570 --> 04:52.990
after yesterday's category two
hurricane tore through Miami.

04:53.015 --> 04:55.806
Law enforcement personnel
of all miami-dade county

04:55.806 --> 04:57.413
agencies are going door to door...

04:57.413 --> 05:02.083
Got a category two hurricane, and we
get sent out to a traffic incident.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.716
What's up with dispatch?

05:03.716 --> 05:05.883
They're slammed with 
thousands of calls,

05:05.883 --> 05:09.026
so we take 'em one at a time
till order's been restored.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.866
I hate to see what a category
four looks like.

05:11.866 --> 05:13.774
So would dispatch.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.250
You get something? / Hi,

05:39.250 --> 05:41.117
I heard a cat crying.

05:41.117 --> 05:42.843
Shelters won't take animals.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.686
People had to leave them behind.
I can see why

05:45.686 --> 05:48.785
some victims get caught in a storm.

05:50.365 --> 05:52.850
Horatio?

06:30.353 --> 06:32.393
What's your name, partner?

06:33.525 --> 06:34.875
Martin.

06:35.075 --> 06:36.990
Do you mind if I call you Marty?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.106
Marty,

06:39.106 --> 06:40.742
I'm going to check you out,

06:40.742 --> 06:42.516
and I don't want you to speak,

06:42.516 --> 06:44.280
okay?

06:50.438 --> 06:52.909
Can, can..

06:55.860 --> 06:58.539
can you move me?

06:58.539 --> 07:00.778
Marty, I...

07:00.988 --> 07:02.999
I don't think that would
be a good idea.

07:02.999 --> 07:04.559
You understand me?

07:04.559 --> 07:06.566
You understand.

07:06.566 --> 07:08.505
Okay.

07:11.010 --> 07:14.148
Is this your house, Marty?
this is your house.

07:14.148 --> 07:17.129
Tell... tell my wife...

07:17.129 --> 07:19.396
Marty, I'll tell her.

07:19.396 --> 07:21.944
Just don't...
just don't... don't leave me.

07:21.944 --> 07:24.837
Please, don't.. don't...
dom't leave me.

07:26.337 --> 07:28.589
I'm right here.

07:28.921 --> 07:31.721
I'm right here, okay?

07:32.444 --> 07:36.830
Marty?

08:07.611 --> 08:09.734
Did rescue clear the house?

08:10.283 --> 08:13.054
Yes. No one inside.

08:13.612 --> 08:15.777
He's got a wife.

08:15.922 --> 08:17.802
Let's find her, alright?

08:18.145 --> 08:20.020
I'll check the shelters.

08:25.217 --> 08:27.786
- Turn him over for me, please.
- Yes, sir.

08:33.363 --> 08:35.623
You think the hurricane
could've done this?

08:36.397 --> 08:39.294
The wind was horizontal.
this was perpendicular.

08:39.849 --> 08:43.813
As he fell from the roof...
Marty could've been up on a ladder.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.043
You know what?
He didn't fall from anywhere.

08:52.043 --> 08:54.147
Take a look at the back of his legs.

08:55.044 --> 08:56.259
The bruising's crescentic,

08:56.259 --> 08:58.349
which means the hammer
would've come from an angle

08:58.349 --> 08:59.892
like below.

09:02.641 --> 09:04.341
We're talking about murder.

09:04.341 --> 09:07.909
That's two suspicious circumstances
in a one-block radius.

09:08.073 --> 09:09.754
Yeah.

09:09.900 --> 09:13.092
Disasters can bring out
the best in people

09:13.092 --> 09:15.574
or the worst.

09:17.113 --> 09:18.647
Take over, will you, Eric?

09:33.751 --> 09:35.647
Look at that 2 x 4.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.494
Hurricane just turned everything
upside down, didn't it?

09:38.702 --> 09:40.676
Actually, on its side.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.400
Sir, can we help you?
Is somebody hurt?

09:52.400 --> 09:53.969
Uh, no, no.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.537
We're all accounted for.

09:55.537 --> 09:57.723
I'm just looking for my hibachi.

09:57.723 --> 10:00.482
Radio says it might be days
before we get the power back on.

10:00.482 --> 10:02.106
A barbecue sounds like a good idea.

10:02.106 --> 10:05.315
Just, uh, don't cook inside.
You might start a fire.

10:08.284 --> 10:10.106
Hey, look at that.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.521
Hey, what's going on?
Is that guy looting?

10:12.647 --> 10:14.474
I don't know, but you
know what they say.

10:14.611 --> 10:16.222
Walks like a duck...

10:19.210 --> 10:21.023
Hey, you need some help with that?

10:21.023 --> 10:22.247
Hi.

10:22.412 --> 10:24.650
Uh, actually, I'm fine.
I got it, thank you.

10:24.650 --> 10:26.345
You sure?

10:28.216 --> 10:29.328
Yeah, thanks.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.159
Is this where you live?

10:31.306 --> 10:32.488
That's right.

10:32.488 --> 10:34.225
I'm sure you can prove it.

10:35.894 --> 10:38.551
Driver's license.
Anything with your address on it.

10:41.689 --> 10:44.170
ok, you know what?
I left it inside.

10:44.380 --> 10:45.732
Shall we?

10:48.336 --> 10:49.948
Okay.

10:53.393 --> 10:55.996
Okay, uh... here...

10:57.322 --> 10:58.910
here you go, dude.

11:01.885 --> 11:04.676
Well, Jed gold,
library card's not gonna cut it.

11:04.676 --> 11:06.516
Something else?

11:08.653 --> 11:10.064
I found something.

11:10.064 --> 11:13.069
It's a picture of him and a woman.

11:13.224 --> 11:14.978
Yeah, that's me.

11:14.978 --> 11:18.187
That's me, sir. See I live here,
that's proof. / Is this your wife?

11:18.256 --> 11:19.724
Yeah. Deena.

11:19.724 --> 11:21.011
Where is she?

11:21.011 --> 11:22.309
I don't know.

11:22.309 --> 11:23.900
What do you mean you don't know?

11:24.042 --> 11:25.399
Do you mind if we look around?

11:25.399 --> 11:26.502
Uh, actually, there's a...

11:26.502 --> 11:28.246
there's a lot of glass back there.

11:28.246 --> 11:30.171
We forgot to...

11:30.171 --> 11:31.423
board up the windows, so...

11:32.311 --> 11:34.355
it's a mess.
I wouldn't want you to...

11:34.355 --> 11:36.595
- hurt yourself.
- I'll take my chances.

11:41.314 --> 11:43.452
Least you weren't lying about the windows.

11:43.652 --> 11:47.331
Biggest mistake people make in a hurricane
is to leave their windows exposed.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.219
One gets broken...

11:50.245 --> 11:52.516
wind gets in, pressure increases,

11:52.516 --> 11:54.462
blows out the other windows.

11:56.355 --> 11:58.838
I'm surprised your roof
didn't come off.

12:08.274 --> 12:10.360
Found your wife.

12:15.587 --> 12:17.685
I swear to god,
I don't know what happened.

12:17.685 --> 12:19.369
I'll tell you what happened.

12:19.487 --> 12:21.503
Your wife is shot.

12:21.567 --> 12:26.256
Bullet entered on the right side, exited
to the left with an upward trajectory,

12:26.424 --> 12:27.832
through and through.

12:27.832 --> 12:30.766
While you were out front loading
your car with electronics.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.129
A jacket.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.721
Did you lose something in the struggle?

12:38.542 --> 12:40.066
Well, I'll tell you what's
going to happen now.

12:40.066 --> 12:43.023
Detective Tripp is going to give you
a ride to the police department.

12:43.508 --> 12:46.669
I thought the roads were
for emergency vehicles only.

12:46.669 --> 12:48.721
Then it should be an exciting ride.

12:49.347 --> 12:50.867
Let's go.

13:10.545 --> 13:12.180
Hi. / Hey.

13:12.180 --> 13:15.525
- Is this Marty medesto's wife?
- Yeah. Found her at the shelter.

13:15.525 --> 13:16.940
She and her brother.

13:17.098 --> 13:19.655
He's parking the car.
Oh, and, uh...

13:20.355 --> 13:22.006
one more thing.

13:28.021 --> 13:30.673
Yeah, 8 and half months.

13:31.888 --> 13:33.213
All right.

13:33.824 --> 13:35.432
Mrs. Medesto...

13:35.950 --> 13:37.738
my name's Horatio caine.

13:38.325 --> 13:40.181
You were with my husband.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.956
I was.

13:42.101 --> 13:44.055
Did Martin suffer?

13:44.856 --> 13:47.014
Mrs. Medesto... / Please?

13:49.343 --> 13:53.028
Mrs. Medesto, your husband's only
concern was you and your family.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.418
Okay?

14:00.988 --> 14:03.320
He was securing the house.

14:03.389 --> 14:05.611
He said that he would
meet us at the shelter.

14:05.611 --> 14:09.105
- If I had only stayed with him.
- And die, too, over a house?

14:09.105 --> 14:11.627
Excuse me? / Martin would have let you if
I hadn't pulled you in the car, you know that.

14:11.627 --> 14:13.818
Excuse me.

14:16.327 --> 14:19.821
Mrs. Medesto, would you do me a favor
and have a seat right on the bench over there

14:19.821 --> 14:22.039
okay? And I'll be with you in a minute.

14:24.159 --> 14:27.588
I take it that you are
Mrs. Medesto's brother.

14:27.749 --> 14:29.023
Miguel.

14:29.023 --> 14:31.796
Thanks for helping us out. / Yeah,
it sounds like you have some issues

14:31.796 --> 14:34.230
with your brother-in-law, Martin.

14:35.835 --> 14:38.219
I didn't think he was good enough
for her. What can I say?

14:38.219 --> 14:41.630
Okay. It's a pretty nasty
bruise under your eye.

14:41.844 --> 14:43.174
Yeah.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.503
Yeah? You were in a fight today?

14:45.806 --> 14:48.986
No, I was out hammering up some
boards and had a little accident.

14:48.986 --> 14:52.522
Did that accident, Miguel, involve attacking
your brother-in-law on a ladder?

14:52.522 --> 14:54.011
No way. / No?

14:54.011 --> 14:56.328
Why don't you describe to me
what happened, then?

14:56.472 --> 14:58.882
I did it, with the back
of my own hammer.

14:58.882 --> 15:01.679
Sounds like quite a trick.
What do you mean?

15:02.172 --> 15:06.693
I was prying out a nail and I hit
myself with my... with my hammer.

15:11.007 --> 15:15.917
Hey, it's true. / Okay, if it's true, then
you won't mind giving me a DNA sample.

15:17.246 --> 15:18.701
Right?

15:24.208 --> 15:28.490
Hurricane anthony tore a 30-mile swath
through miami and the everglades yesterday,

15:28.490 --> 15:31.723
leaving behind over $3 billion in damage.

15:31.723 --> 15:35.346
The category two hurricane hit
coconut grove especially hard

15:35.346 --> 15:37.159
with an eight-foot storm surge.

15:37.159 --> 15:39.842
Traffic to miami beach is being rerouted.

15:39.842 --> 15:43.229
Power has finally been restored
in little havana and coral gables,

15:43.229 --> 15:45.343
though hundreds of homes ofresidents are still in the dark.

15:45.343 --> 15:48.171
Be advised that the FPNL is
working around the clock

15:48.171 --> 15:50.507
to get the power back up and running.

15:50.507 --> 15:53.787
And finally, the death toll
continues to climb.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.246
21 confirmed dead
and many still missing.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.765
So you came to see
your windshield man.

16:01.765 --> 16:03.860
A lot of bodies lining
the hallway out there.

16:03.860 --> 16:05.692
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:05.844 --> 16:07.003
Guess with all the new construction,

16:07.003 --> 16:10.305
people thought mandatory evacuation
didn't apply to them.

16:10.305 --> 16:12.394
Well, assumption is the
mother of disaster.

16:12.394 --> 16:14.530
And in this case, drowning.

16:16.415 --> 16:19.458
This guy hits the windshield
but dies of drowning?

16:19.458 --> 16:21.757
After I cleaned the leaves
and wrappers out of his mouth,

16:21.757 --> 16:24.440
a blood-stained foam erupted
from his lungs, which means...

16:24.440 --> 16:28.362
he had air, water and mucus
present during respiration.

16:28.811 --> 16:31.039
The rain filled his lungs,

16:31.609 --> 16:33.125
collapsed his alveoli,

16:33.125 --> 16:35.640
then saturated his red blood
cells until they burst.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.392
Caused heart failure.

16:45.602 --> 16:47.762
so he drowned on rain.

16:48.631 --> 16:50.653
Horizontally. / Yeah.

16:50.852 --> 16:52.325
Hurricane rain.

16:52.325 --> 16:53.951
What's that?

16:54.074 --> 16:55.609
The yellow stuff?

16:56.156 --> 16:57.921
Waxy substance?

16:57.921 --> 16:59.170
I don't know,

16:59.170 --> 17:01.420
but it was all over his arm.

17:02.816 --> 17:05.064
So do we even know
who he is? / No,

17:05.064 --> 17:06.856
and we're not going to,

17:06.856 --> 17:11.118
not the conventional way.
Fingerprints are sanded down.

17:12.714 --> 17:16.278
and I found this wedged
in his cheekbone.

17:16.424 --> 17:18.042
That a chin piece?

17:18.582 --> 17:21.025
Plastic surgery? / Had botox,

17:21.025 --> 17:23.219
caps, dyed hair, too.

17:23.219 --> 17:25.393
You got your work cut
out for you, Speed.

17:25.393 --> 17:28.473
Looks like this boy
had something to hide.

17:29.535 --> 17:31.594
You lied to me, Jed.

17:32.532 --> 17:34.541
But we were married.

17:34.682 --> 17:36.310
Which makes you divorced.

17:36.310 --> 17:39.421
Explains why Deena recently
got a T.R.O. against you.

17:39.801 --> 17:42.002
I never did anything to her. / No.

17:42.002 --> 17:45.552
No, you just ignored a temporary
restraining order and you shot her.

17:45.721 --> 17:48.087
They just checked my hands.

17:48.254 --> 17:49.989
No gunshot residue, remember?

17:49.989 --> 17:52.022
Yeah, well, simple soap and
water could take care of that,

17:52.022 --> 17:53.590
not to mention rain from the storm.

17:53.590 --> 17:56.113
Dude, I don't even have
a permit for a gun.

17:56.113 --> 17:57.438
You know what we call that?

17:57.438 --> 17:59.856
We call that an unregistered firearm.

17:59.856 --> 18:01.797
We find that gun in your car
or somewhere in the house,

18:01.797 --> 18:04.746
- takes us just a step closer to you.
- Go for it.

18:04.746 --> 18:06.520
You got nothing on me, man.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.500
Yeah, well, we're just getting started,

18:08.919 --> 18:10.305
dude.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.752
Any luck locating the projectile?

18:21.752 --> 18:23.546
Just hard work.

18:23.546 --> 18:25.979
I've got a big, fat bullet
with blood on it.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.989
Well, the hubby's swearing
he didn't do it, so is there

18:27.989 --> 18:30.448
any possibility
this could have been a suicide?

18:32.870 --> 18:35.348
No, I don't think so,
seeing as how I found the gun

18:35.348 --> 18:37.418
in the nightstand next to the bed.

18:37.418 --> 18:39.799
There was a nosy neighbor
came by that said

18:39.799 --> 18:41.615
that the deceased bought the
gun a few months back

18:41.615 --> 18:43.847
for protection from her
estranged husband.

18:43.847 --> 18:45.453
She did target practice out back.

18:45.453 --> 18:46.830
In a nice neighborhood like this?

18:46.830 --> 18:49.845
Well, I guess it shows you how
desperate she must have been.

18:52.514 --> 18:55.606
so, the guy comes over to claim what
the divorce judge didn't give him.

18:55.606 --> 18:58.915
She's afraid of him.
Gets out the gun for protection.

18:58.915 --> 19:00.949
He takes it from her and uses it on her.

19:00.949 --> 19:02.758
And we catch him making his getaway.

19:02.758 --> 19:05.337
I'm going to head over to the lab.
If I find his prints on this weapon,

19:05.337 --> 19:06.834
I'll find you.

19:06.834 --> 19:07.999
All right.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.849
Hey, Eric. / Hey. H.

19:12.849 --> 19:16.095
I haven't found a ladder or a hammer yet.

19:16.318 --> 19:18.737
You know what?
Let's get a shot of this.

19:22.542 --> 19:26.579
Brother-in-law mentioned something
about nailing up some boards.

19:26.579 --> 19:29.207
Anything about nails with blood on them?

19:32.331 --> 19:35.247
Gee, he left that part out, didn't he?

19:35.405 --> 19:37.919
Okay, let's get this to DNA.

19:37.919 --> 19:39.841
All right.

19:41.769 --> 19:44.460
Why would the board stay put, not the ladder?

19:44.605 --> 19:49.699
Well, things that are flushed to the ground
in a hurricane tend to stay that way.

19:49.699 --> 19:52.068
Wind does nothing to get under.

19:55.689 --> 19:57.396
What've we got, H?

19:57.554 --> 20:00.366
Why do these roses survive the hurricane?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.345
It's where Martin's body landed.

20:02.345 --> 20:04.733
He probably shielded them from the storm.

20:08.313 --> 20:10.020
That would mean

20:10.020 --> 20:12.377
that he was killed
before the storm, right?

20:12.377 --> 20:15.169
- It means we just got a timeline.
- So, mother nature...

20:15.169 --> 20:18.059
has helped us out. Nice going.

21:06.989 --> 21:09.173
Gun doesn't appear to have
been fired recently?

21:09.173 --> 21:10.893
It doesn't.

21:10.893 --> 21:12.591
I have to call 'em like I see 'em.

21:12.591 --> 21:14.257
You got to do better than that.

21:14.257 --> 21:15.740
Look at that guy.

21:15.740 --> 21:19.232
Divorce or not, the girl's dead
and he's shed nary a tear.

21:19.232 --> 21:23.120
Well, if you'll look, I did find that the weapon
could have been cleaned after it was fired.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.780
Yeah, he could have worn gloves.

21:24.780 --> 21:28.206
No big stretch. / Yeah, it could show
forethought of malice.

21:28.206 --> 21:31.694
But either way, you're right,
it's not laying out the way we expected.

21:32.078 --> 21:33.591
Hey, Alexx, what's up?

21:33.591 --> 21:36.131
Came by on this very case.
That the T.R.O. husband?

21:36.131 --> 21:37.709
One and the same.

21:39.853 --> 21:41.513
Entry wound on his ex.

21:41.513 --> 21:43.756
It's ragged. Take a look.

21:43.919 --> 21:45.583
It is ragged,

21:45.583 --> 21:48.479
indicating it penetrated with
less force than a direct hit.

21:48.479 --> 21:50.880
Like an injury consistent with a ricochet.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.272
Bullet pinged around the place?

21:52.272 --> 21:54.408
Well, something had to slow
it down before entry.

21:54.408 --> 21:56.515
Either way, you know what that means?

21:57.154 --> 21:59.332
Back to the crime scene.

22:15.293 --> 22:16.723
Any luck finding that ricochet?

22:16.723 --> 22:18.557
None so far.

22:19.451 --> 22:20.721
Where are we going with this?

22:20.721 --> 22:23.617
Well, in the absence of a ricochet hit,
I can use the lasers to find out

22:23.617 --> 22:25.649
where the bullet was actually shot from.

22:25.649 --> 22:27.667
Be easier to do with the power on.

22:28.234 --> 22:31.337
Actually, it works in our favor.

22:32.467 --> 22:37.034
I can use these two points
as a frame of reference.

22:45.528 --> 22:47.611
That is weird. / What?

22:47.611 --> 22:49.341
I mean, look.

22:49.514 --> 22:52.207
Busted window, that's all.
Well, we assumed it was from the wind,

22:52.207 --> 22:53.985
but maybe not.

22:58.427 --> 23:00.532
Look at all those spent bullets.

23:01.998 --> 23:03.634
Think he opened fire from the yard?

23:03.634 --> 23:06.133
No. I've got another suspect in mind.

23:06.133 --> 23:07.302
Who?

23:07.302 --> 23:10.029
I'll tell you when I'm sure.
Will you help me collect these?

23:10.029 --> 23:11.575
I already got a collection.

23:12.539 --> 23:14.357
Female. Cleans up after herself.

23:14.357 --> 23:16.608
Collected her own spent bullets.

23:16.969 --> 23:18.760
Tidy gun owner.

23:20.229 --> 23:22.749
Well, it may have been what got her killed.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.489
- The interior of the car, Speed?- I put that on the backburner,

23:41.489 --> 23:44.875
because I got this theory about the
guy who slammed into the vehicle.

23:44.875 --> 23:48.027
Theory being that he's concealing
his identity, right?

23:48.027 --> 23:50.236
Well, there's that, and uh,

23:50.236 --> 23:52.733
I ran some traces that
I found in autopsy.

23:52.733 --> 23:55.558
You got acetone, xylene, toluene.

23:55.558 --> 23:58.071
You got, uh, titanium dioxide,

23:58.071 --> 24:00.571
- various hydrocarbons...
- Non-skid.

24:00.571 --> 24:04.709
What surfers use. / Yeah.
Prevents slippage on your board.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.440
I'm thinking he's one of
these guys that goes out,

24:10.440 --> 24:13.396
tries to catch the monster
wave before the big storm.

24:13.396 --> 24:14.630
Okay, go on.

24:14.630 --> 24:16.441
Well, the physics of loft.

24:16.441 --> 24:19.128
This guy's found half a mile inland.

24:19.128 --> 24:20.808
He's got surfing epoxy on him.

24:20.808 --> 24:23.804
Hurricanes pick up small boats,
small animals.

24:23.804 --> 24:25.967
I mean, a surf board
could be used for loft.

24:25.967 --> 24:28.730
Right, hurricane
picked him up at the beach,

24:28.730 --> 24:31.598
and then dropped him on the
hood of that car inland.

24:31.754 --> 24:33.946
- It's possible.
- If he got caught in a vortex,

24:33.946 --> 24:36.782
- there's a very good chance.
- Vortex?

24:36.782 --> 24:38.814
- What is that... like a tornado?
- But smaller.

24:38.814 --> 24:41.670
Winds whip 'em up,
then they take off on their own.

24:42.035 --> 24:44.349
Gusts hit 150 miles per hour.

24:44.349 --> 24:46.815
Surf board under his arm for loft...

24:46.815 --> 24:49.065
a guy could get picked up.

24:57.777 --> 24:59.636
so by determining the vortex,

24:59.636 --> 25:01.855
we could figure out where
he was picked up, right?

25:01.855 --> 25:04.008
Doppler radar can help.

25:04.008 --> 25:06.030
Let's check with accu-weather.

25:06.030 --> 25:08.851
It tracks the movement of the vortex.

25:08.851 --> 25:12.636
He came down in coconut grove.
So looks like...

25:12.636 --> 25:16.210
- this vortex picked him up.
- Spinning over hobie beach.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.038
What kind of guy surfs in a hurricane?

25:18.038 --> 25:20.005
Well, he's either a thrillseeker,

25:20.117 --> 25:22.026
or he's got nothing to lose.

25:22.026 --> 25:24.741
Grab a uniform, Speed.
Go check it out.

25:45.685 --> 25:47.491
Blood on the nails.

25:47.617 --> 25:49.517
Yes, sir.

25:50.323 --> 25:52.233
Not a match to your victim on the fence.

25:52.233 --> 25:56.578
And no match to the your suspect
with the black eye, his brother-in-law.

25:56.776 --> 25:58.518
Okay...

25:59.252 --> 26:01.482
so we've got a third man.

26:01.653 --> 26:03.247
Let's run this against CODIS,

26:03.247 --> 26:07.278
and see if we get any hits,
all right? / All right.

26:11.553 --> 26:13.587
Wasn't speed supposed
to do this? / Yes.

26:13.587 --> 26:16.590
I sent him to the beach.

26:20.873 --> 26:23.149
Wait a second.

26:24.313 --> 26:26.285
Hey, take a look at that.

26:26.674 --> 26:28.298
See that right there?

26:28.298 --> 26:29.917
That is blood.

26:29.917 --> 26:31.837
Hang on to that, will you?

26:32.001 --> 26:34.793
The victim only hit the windshield.

26:35.633 --> 26:38.153
He never was actually in the car.

26:40.006 --> 26:44.644
Yes, but that's exactly
what makes this blood interesting.

26:46.801 --> 26:48.487
Your cut.

26:48.487 --> 26:50.876
It looks infected.

26:51.203 --> 26:53.131
However you got it.

26:53.632 --> 26:55.670
I was forced

26:55.670 --> 26:59.976
to remove a young lady from
her apartment during the storm surge.

26:59.976 --> 27:04.527
- And that is how she thanked you?
- Yes, that and a few choice words.

27:06.557 --> 27:08.137
Hang on.

27:08.300 --> 27:11.395
Speed. / Yeah, I found some
people who know our surfer.

27:11.395 --> 27:14.235
Okay. / They say his name
is John smith.

27:14.235 --> 27:16.579
All right, well,
that sounds bogus.

27:16.579 --> 27:18.023
You get an address?

27:18.023 --> 27:20.427
He's on their mailing list,
so I'm going to head over there now.

27:20.427 --> 27:22.053
All right, keep me posted.

27:26.662 --> 27:29.170
That the stuff from the
John smith shack?

27:29.945 --> 27:32.007
You were supposed
to meet me at the truck.

27:32.137 --> 27:34.554
I figured you could use the exercise.
It's good for you.

27:34.554 --> 27:35.767
Thank you.

27:35.767 --> 27:39.073
20 bucks says "John smith"
jumped bail on a violent crime.

27:39.073 --> 27:42.185
40 that he's in witness
protection program.

27:42.298 --> 27:44.336
All the goombas want to come
down to south florida.

27:44.336 --> 27:45.740
For what, the weather?

27:45.740 --> 27:49.214
Look, if he was in witsec, CODIS would've
red-flagged him as being in the program.

27:49.214 --> 27:52.299
- I did one of those last year.
- Do you mind getting the door?

27:55.267 --> 27:58.233
- Traction-n-more.
- It's for surf boards.

27:58.664 --> 28:02.227
How'd you miss this? / P.D. Packed
the boxes, I didn't miss anything.

28:03.977 --> 28:06.423
He sprayed it on the surf board, and..

28:06.649 --> 28:09.823
it transferred onto his body.

28:13.413 --> 28:16.024
Then the wizard of oz touched down.

28:16.679 --> 28:18.382
Pizza places,

28:18.382 --> 28:20.400
eye doctor.

28:20.716 --> 28:23.303
I've got a used library books.

28:23.303 --> 28:25.592
Surfing documentaries.

28:25.732 --> 28:27.893
At least the guy died
doing something he liked.

28:27.893 --> 28:29.319
What kind of books?

28:29.905 --> 28:31.711
we got a mystery.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.619
- Thriller and accounting.
- Accounting?

28:34.619 --> 28:36.880
He's a surf bum accountant?

28:40.399 --> 28:42.458
Something's up with that.

28:42.979 --> 28:47.709
Check book.
count balance of $98.26.

28:47.709 --> 28:48.974
The guy was neat.

28:48.974 --> 28:50.900
Crosses his sevens.

28:54.939 --> 28:56.610
Check this out.

28:57.250 --> 28:59.227
Six years ago.

29:01.438 --> 29:04.156
Jersey city accountant disappears.

29:04.156 --> 29:07.498
Local man,
Steven granger, went missing

29:07.498 --> 29:09.626
friday after an IRS meeting

29:09.626 --> 29:14.343
about his recent accounting records
for reputed mobster, Ilia krestavich.

29:14.343 --> 29:17.092
That's nice. / He could have
been running from the IRS.

29:17.092 --> 29:20.600
The IRS usually lets you work
out a payment plan.

29:20.939 --> 29:22.430
My guess...

29:22.430 --> 29:24.209
is that he was running
from these mob guys.

29:24.209 --> 29:26.230
- He got caught stealing.
- How much did he steal?

29:26.230 --> 29:31.055
There was a discrepancy of $1,500,000.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.282
- And the guy's living in a shack?
- The overhead is low.

29:34.282 --> 29:36.738
$1.5 mil'll go a long way.

29:36.965 --> 29:38.163
A lifetime.

29:38.163 --> 29:41.549
I guess we figured out why this guy
would surf in a hurricane.

29:42.467 --> 29:45.438
We did? / Yeah, he was an accountant
who steals from the mob.

29:45.438 --> 29:47.260
He's a nut job.

29:48.052 --> 29:50.455
Can't be that nuts.
He got away with it.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.835
He got away from the mob,
not the hurricane.

30:00.956 --> 30:02.617
Horatio.

30:02.808 --> 30:04.916
I didn't get any hits on CODIS.

30:04.916 --> 30:08.960
But I did run the report on the blood from
the plywood nailsin Medesto's backyard,

30:08.960 --> 30:11.712
against the blood you got in
the car like you asked me to.

30:12.467 --> 30:16.000
Not that I understood why,
frankly, but... / findings?

30:16.435 --> 30:17.850
They match.

30:17.850 --> 30:21.171
One in 4.3 trillion people
have these combinations.

30:21.171 --> 30:23.990
There're only six billion
people on earth, so...

30:23.990 --> 30:26.046
these crimes are linked.

30:26.046 --> 30:27.679
To one criminal. / All right.

30:27.679 --> 30:29.124
Thank you.

30:29.242 --> 30:30.782
sure.

30:32.111 --> 30:33.779
Yelina, yeah, hi.

30:33.779 --> 30:37.166
- Listen, this driver stinks.
- Let's bring him in.

30:37.334 --> 30:39.597
Martin medesto, my neighbor?

30:39.597 --> 30:42.274
- Your late neighbor.
- Yeah, I know. I heard.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.806
Poor Susana. I know she's got a baby
on the way and everything.

30:44.806 --> 30:48.685
Do I detect a note of insincerity
on your part, Todd?

30:48.773 --> 30:50.448
No. we were friendly.

30:50.448 --> 30:53.848
Well, then, can you explain to me
how we found your blood

30:53.848 --> 30:56.436
at the foot of Martin's body?

30:56.570 --> 30:57.777
My blood?

30:57.777 --> 31:03.717
We found it on some nails protruding
through a piece of plywood.

31:05.354 --> 31:07.916
I mean, I, I lent him my lawn mower,

31:07.916 --> 31:10.778
I knocked into this plank
with nails sticking out of it.

31:10.778 --> 31:13.299
It was in his garage.
About a week ago.

31:14.785 --> 31:17.083
- Not award winning.
- No, not award wining,

31:17.083 --> 31:21.954
and not even close.
We also found blood inside your car.

31:25.614 --> 31:28.265
- You found blood?
- Yeah, your blood.

31:28.436 --> 31:31.478
So either you're a hemophiliac,

31:31.596 --> 31:33.646
which I doubt,

31:33.646 --> 31:36.872
or you were up to no good
on hurricane day.

31:37.595 --> 31:40.070
If you're so convinced,

31:40.070 --> 31:42.145
why don't you prove it?

31:42.145 --> 31:45.811
Show me how it is that you think
I stuck my neighbor on top of his fence.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.094
I'm going to.

32:02.671 --> 32:03.904
You sure about this?

32:03.904 --> 32:08.088
Oxidation on all these spent bullets
tells us they were fired some time ago.

32:13.493 --> 32:14.553
Florida humidity?

32:14.553 --> 32:18.221
It's the same oxidation as
the bullet that killed Deena.

32:18.221 --> 32:20.137
I couldn't see it until
I cleaned all the blood off.

32:20.137 --> 32:22.300
You're telling me the bullet
that killed Deena was shot twice.

32:22.300 --> 32:23.154
Yes.

32:23.154 --> 32:25.945
The first time was by Deena
herself at target practice.

32:25.945 --> 32:28.416
1,250 feet per second.

32:28.687 --> 32:31.873
And then, you were right.
She cleaned up after herself.

32:36.836 --> 32:39.996
And that's where the spent bullet stayed
until the hurricane came through,

32:39.996 --> 32:43.334
picked it up and shot it
a second time... into her.

32:43.334 --> 32:46.369
I want my stereo. It's mine.
Okay? / I don't want to sit here...

32:46.369 --> 32:51.635
150 mile-an-hour wind can whip a bullet
220 to 300 feet per second.

32:53.598 --> 32:56.025
Listen, that's mine!
We have to leave!

32:59.771 --> 33:02.537
This one is definitely going to hit
the ballistics lecture circuit.

33:02.537 --> 33:04.543
The only question I have is.

33:04.543 --> 33:06.325
Where was Jed?

33:06.652 --> 33:10.036
Under the bed, with his jacket.

33:12.659 --> 33:15.045
So what, I was under the bed.

33:15.204 --> 33:17.834
- That makes me the smart guy.
- It makes you a smart coward.

33:17.834 --> 33:21.433
Whatever, dude. Bottom line is
it's murder by hurricane.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.425
I didn't do it.
I'm out of here.

33:23.425 --> 33:24.847
- See you around.
- Oh, I don't think so.

33:24.847 --> 33:27.207
- Detective?
- You're under arrest.

33:27.207 --> 33:29.296
For what? / Grand theft.

33:29.418 --> 33:31.433
- Grand theft?
- You were divorced.

33:31.433 --> 33:33.742
It's your wife's property.
You have no right to it.

33:33.742 --> 33:35.499
You're going to go away
for a few years.

33:35.499 --> 33:37.524
- God, I can't believe this.
- Well, you will.

33:37.524 --> 33:40.019
when you're decked out
in a set of orange jail jumps.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.841
Your only electronics is going
to be a fuzzy black and white tv

33:42.841 --> 33:44.965
you're going to share with hard-timers.

33:44.965 --> 33:47.304
About 50 of them.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.133
So, DNA results show a match
from the driver's seat

33:57.133 --> 34:00.109
and the blood found on the plywood
nails in Martin medesto's bark yard.

34:00.109 --> 34:02.474
From Marty's killer.
That's right.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.532
How did it get there?

34:04.946 --> 34:07.741
I'm working the hypothetical
like you suggested.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.360
Based on the crime scene photos,

34:09.360 --> 34:11.647
- I've created this rendering.
- Okay, here's what we do.

34:11.647 --> 34:15.045
Let's add the plywood
we found just below Marty.

34:15.045 --> 34:17.020
Marty would have been here,

34:17.181 --> 34:19.489
and the board, there.

34:19.489 --> 34:22.510
Flat on the ground.
Hurricane couldn't move it.

34:22.510 --> 34:25.797
Now add the second man at
five feet nine inches tall

34:25.797 --> 34:27.940
and place him at the bottom
of the ladder.

34:31.099 --> 34:33.023
Good. Now,

34:33.023 --> 34:35.063
collapse the ladder backwards.

34:35.063 --> 34:38.170
If he were to give a pull of the ladder.

34:38.170 --> 34:41.578
Your unknown man's squarely
on the nails. / Yes, he does.

34:41.578 --> 34:42.936
And you know what?

34:42.936 --> 34:44.746
He's not unknown.

34:47.594 --> 34:50.524
Todd, let me see your back.

34:53.161 --> 34:55.678
Let's go. Back.

35:02.477 --> 35:03.955
See, Todd,

35:03.955 --> 35:07.985
Those nail marks nail
you for this crime.

35:11.419 --> 35:13.748
Okay, it was an accident.

35:13.748 --> 35:16.479
I was on the ladder with Martin,
helping him board up his house,

35:16.479 --> 35:18.272
and the wind from
the hurricane blew us over.

35:18.272 --> 35:21.184
So, you accidentally
hammered his calves,

35:21.184 --> 35:25.672
and you were accidentally blown over?

35:25.672 --> 35:29.159
Fine. So, we had a small fight first.

35:29.298 --> 35:31.482
Doesn't mean I killed the guy.
It's assault and battery.

35:31.482 --> 35:34.105
You know how I know you're lying, Todd?

35:35.149 --> 35:38.254
That's why.
You know what that is?

35:39.780 --> 35:41.446
A rose. / Yeah. A rosebud.

35:41.446 --> 35:44.752
We found that intact
under Martin's body.

35:44.752 --> 35:48.182
Hurricane wiped out all the others.
It's called a time line.

35:48.182 --> 35:51.694
So, your little accident
happened before the hurricane.

35:51.694 --> 35:54.607
What she's saying is that
the storm didn't kill him.

35:54.607 --> 35:56.063
You did.

35:56.063 --> 35:57.481
Damn it, Martin,
I need the ladder.

35:57.481 --> 35:59.462
- Give me a chance.
- You're already boarded.

35:59.462 --> 36:02.334
Get off me. / Storm's going
to destroy my house.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.471
Man, I need it.
Give it to me.

36:28.170 --> 36:29.842
He was double boarding.

36:29.842 --> 36:31.079
Excuse me?

36:31.079 --> 36:33.528
He had one set of boards up
on his house already,

36:33.528 --> 36:35.757
and he still wouldn't loan me his ladder
so I could take care of mine.

36:35.757 --> 36:39.070
So while you boarded your house,
Martin bled to death in his backyard.

36:39.070 --> 36:41.373
That's right, and then you went
out to your car,

36:41.373 --> 36:44.205
and you bled in your car on the seat.

36:47.161 --> 36:50.147
- I was trying to save my house.
- Yeah, and you did.

36:50.147 --> 36:52.529
You did save your house, didn't you?
The problem is,

36:52.529 --> 36:57.001
is you're not going to be seeing
that house for a long time now, are you?

37:02.264 --> 37:05.253
Will you tell his wife that I said I'm sorry?

37:05.596 --> 37:06.766
Yeah.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.392
I can do that.
I'll speak to his wife.

37:09.534 --> 37:11.164
Just out of curiosity,

37:11.164 --> 37:12.712
Todd,

37:12.712 --> 37:14.327
what should I tell...

37:14.327 --> 37:16.917
his unborn child?

37:20.357 --> 37:22.281
Think about it.

37:30.694 --> 37:32.512
Miguel?

37:32.998 --> 37:34.961
Lieutenant.

37:36.932 --> 37:38.575
My sister's in the hospital.

37:38.575 --> 37:41.089
- Everything okay?
- She had a baby boy.

37:41.089 --> 37:43.393
Wanted to let you know.
No complications, healthy.

37:43.393 --> 37:44.563
That's great.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.710
We, uh, we got Martin's killer.

37:46.710 --> 37:50.029
It turns out to be the neighbor
across the street.

37:54.149 --> 37:57.268
Hey, no hard feelings
for coming after me.

37:57.268 --> 37:59.750
Are you going to look in on the little boy?

38:00.277 --> 38:02.078
Right.

38:02.078 --> 38:04.206
Miguel?

38:05.935 --> 38:08.215
It's going to be weird, that's all.

38:08.215 --> 38:12.235
Didn't always approve of how
his old man treated my sister.

38:14.881 --> 38:18.980
- What do I tell his kid?
- Let's tell him that his father...

38:18.980 --> 38:22.063
his father died trying
to save their home.

38:22.887 --> 38:24.551
Right.

38:25.111 --> 38:26.863
Thank you, lieutenant. / Sure.

38:26.863 --> 38:28.647
You take care.

38:32.285 --> 38:33.243
Hi, guys.

38:33.243 --> 38:34.542
Bye, guys.

38:34.775 --> 38:36.092
Hey, Calleigh.

38:36.092 --> 38:37.800
I, uh, heard you busted the stereo man.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.974
Hey. I heard you found out who
the car crash victim really is.

38:40.974 --> 38:43.066
Yup. He was a bad guy.

38:43.271 --> 38:44.985
You know maybe not all bad.

38:44.985 --> 38:48.125
I think the mob would disagree
about 1.5 million times.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.894
But you know what I was thinking?
If he hadn't have stolen from the mob,

38:50.894 --> 38:52.933
then he never would have become
a beach bum in florida,

38:52.933 --> 38:55.178
and then he never would have
gotten picked up by the hurricane,

38:55.178 --> 38:56.899
and if he hadn't have gotten
picked up by the hurricane,

38:56.899 --> 38:58.672
he never would have hit Burton's car,

38:58.672 --> 39:02.306
and if it wasn't for hitting Burton's car,
Burton would've gotten away with murder.

39:05.567 --> 39:10.018
Leave it to you, Calleigh, to find
something good to come out of a hurricane.

39:10.145 --> 39:12.661
They do alleviate global warming.

39:13.754 --> 39:15.846
She's, uh,

39:16.023 --> 39:18.525
way too cheerful.

40:05.964 --> 40:08.478
Hi.

40:08.783 --> 40:11.266
Oh, I just locked up
the paperwork on Burton.

40:11.266 --> 40:13.758
- But if you want it.
- No. That's okay, that's fine.

40:13.758 --> 40:15.148
It won't be a problem.

40:15.148 --> 40:17.181
I'll just be a minute. / Okay.

40:19.722 --> 40:21.577
Here we go.
That's all the papers.

40:21.577 --> 40:22.864
All right.

40:22.864 --> 40:24.769
All rightie.

40:26.412 --> 40:28.578
I was, uh...
I was wondering...

40:28.578 --> 40:29.949
I was wondering what, uh,

40:29.949 --> 40:33.100
you guys were doing tonight,
you and Ray, jr..

40:34.042 --> 40:37.098
well, um, you're gonna have to, uh...

40:37.098 --> 40:39.105
you're gonna to have to
take that board up down,

40:39.105 --> 40:41.766
so I, I assume you're
going to need some help.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.311
Lieutenant Caine?

40:44.311 --> 40:48.556
Yeah. / You, uh, evacuated me.

40:48.556 --> 40:50.284
They.. they told me
I could find you here.

40:50.284 --> 40:51.684
Right. Um,

40:51.684 --> 40:53.458
Julie, right? / Uh, Julia.

40:53.458 --> 40:55.190
Julia, okay.

40:55.590 --> 40:57.164
Julia,

40:57.164 --> 40:59.405
I'll be right with you.

41:06.553 --> 41:08.643
Excuse me.

41:32.624 --> 41:33.925
How's she doing?

41:33.925 --> 41:35.944
She's, um...

41:36.195 --> 41:38.969
I think she's going to be fine.

41:39.608 --> 41:41.620
How, um...

41:41.801 --> 41:44.359
how did later sound?

41:46.697 --> 41:48.628
I think that would be nice.

41:48.913 --> 41:50.339
Good.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.063
Good.

41:53.816 --> 41:55.367
So I'll see you later.

41:55.963 --> 41:57.551
Yeah.

41:57.757 --> 41:59.287
Okay.

41:59.738 --> 42:00.990
Yeah.

42:00.990 --> 42:02.573
Thank you.

42:23.690 --> 42:27.046
The city of Miami is returning
to normal after Anthony.

42:27.046 --> 42:29.946
Power is back on in
all but outlying areas,

42:29.946 --> 42:32.514
and homeowners are
digging out of their homes.

42:32.514 --> 42:35.032
Surf's a calm foot to foot and a half.

42:35.032 --> 42:37.450
Thanks to the trade
winds out of the bahamas,

42:37.450 --> 42:40.620
temperature's a balmy 72.
