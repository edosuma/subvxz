00:43.437 --> 00:44.802
Buck?

00:44.838 --> 00:50.135
- What happened, sir?
- Oh, Hank, thank goodness.

00:50.177 --> 00:52.475
This horn was giving me
an awful headache.

00:52.512 --> 00:53.843
Is there a propane leak?

00:53.880 --> 00:56.041
Oh, God, it's Goobers mooches,
isn't it?

00:56.083 --> 00:58.347
I told them that buffet
was a death trap!

00:58.385 --> 00:59.443
Naw, Old Top!

00:59.486 --> 01:02.080
I come a-calling
with good news!

01:02.122 --> 01:04.283
The zoning board approved!

01:04.324 --> 01:05.313
You mean...

01:05.358 --> 01:07.259
The new storage yard!

01:07.294 --> 01:09.888
Triple the storage capacity!

01:09.930 --> 01:11.989
Wow, the new storage yard...

01:12.032 --> 01:15.229
I-I can't believe
it's finally happening.

01:15.268 --> 01:16.292
Just one problem, though.

01:16.336 --> 01:18.600
I need you to buy me some art.

01:18.638 --> 01:20.162
Uh, sir, I...

01:20.207 --> 01:22.835
Zoning board won't give you
something for nothing.

01:22.876 --> 01:24.434
They passed this public art law;

01:24.478 --> 01:26.708
got to beautify one part of town

01:26.747 --> 01:29.375
if they're gonna let you
uglify another.

01:29.416 --> 01:31.577
Keeps everything nice and even.

01:31.618 --> 01:34.178
But I don't know
the first thing about art.

01:34.221 --> 01:38.317
The Zoning Board can't
hang excuses in city hall, Hank.

01:38.358 --> 01:40.724
Now get buying!

01:46.733 --> 01:47.722
Hello, Triple-A.

01:47.768 --> 01:48.962
Hey, there.

01:49.002 --> 01:50.936
Oh, hey, Hank,
what can I do you for?

01:50.971 --> 01:54.429
Well, I got kind of a tall order
for you, Fred.

01:54.474 --> 01:57.932
Uh, I need some help with...
uh, buying some art.

01:57.978 --> 01:59.070
Let's see.

01:59.112 --> 02:01.376
There's the McMaynerbury
artists' colony.

02:01.415 --> 02:02.712
Do they have good art?

02:02.749 --> 02:04.376
Couldn't say,

02:04.418 --> 02:06.249
but it's one of this month's
"Great Drives."

02:07.621 --> 02:09.612
<i>Boy, this</i> is <i>a great drive</i>.

02:09.656 --> 02:11.647
Do you already know
what kind of art

02:11.691 --> 02:12.680
you're gonna buy?

02:12.726 --> 02:15.251
Because I should
let you know now...

02:15.295 --> 02:17.695
I'm willing to
pose for a statue.

02:17.731 --> 02:19.892
Uh, thanks, Bobby.

02:19.933 --> 02:22.424
But this art is
going to be put in the median

02:22.469 --> 02:23.629
on Travis Boulevard.

02:23.670 --> 02:25.137
A lot of people drive by there

02:25.172 --> 02:26.696
on their way to the interstate

02:26.740 --> 02:28.332
and I want them to be inspired

02:28.375 --> 02:29.467
when they get there.

02:41.521 --> 02:43.489
What kind of?

02:43.523 --> 02:44.956
Thank God you're here.

02:44.991 --> 02:47.221
I haven't been able
to send a fax in two days.

02:47.260 --> 02:50.718
Uh, no, uh, I'm Hank Hill,
Strickland Propane.

02:50.764 --> 02:53.358
I need to buy
a piece of public art,

02:53.400 --> 02:56.858
about three feet across,
five or seven feet tall.

02:56.903 --> 02:58.871
Doesn't have to be real arty.

02:58.905 --> 03:00.463
No nudity, of course.

03:00.507 --> 03:03.874
Maybe something with
a lion or a bald eagle.

03:03.910 --> 03:06.470
Something that says America.

03:06.513 --> 03:07.537
Hmm.

03:07.581 --> 03:09.105
Oh, wait, wait!
I've got it.

03:09.149 --> 03:11.140
A life-sized portrait

03:11.184 --> 03:12.651
of George Washington!

03:12.686 --> 03:13.653
It's a hologram.

03:13.687 --> 03:15.086
From here... George Washington.

03:15.122 --> 03:17.283
But from over here,
he morphs into Adolph Hitler.

03:18.225 --> 03:19.886
Washington, Hitler.

03:19.926 --> 03:21.120
Washington,

03:21.161 --> 03:22.185
Hitler.

03:25.031 --> 03:26.794
Picture Ronald Reagan.

03:26.833 --> 03:27.925
He's squatting over...

03:27.968 --> 03:30.368
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

03:30.403 --> 03:32.268
I have just the thing.

03:33.340 --> 03:34.329
I'm calling it

03:34.374 --> 03:35.466
Industrial Penis

03:35.509 --> 03:37.204
Number Five.
Bobby! Car!

03:40.313 --> 03:42.975
...and then it just got
worse from there.

03:43.016 --> 03:43.983
I don't get it.

03:44.017 --> 03:45.348
I just wanted to buy something

03:45.385 --> 03:46.977
that people would
want to look at,

03:47.020 --> 03:48.681
spruce up that highway median.

03:48.722 --> 03:51.384
Isn't that what art's
supposed to be?

03:51.424 --> 03:53.187
Hey, man, you know,
you dang ol' naive, man.

03:53.226 --> 03:55.251
Talkin' 'bout ol' like a dang
ol' dada, you know,

03:55.295 --> 03:56.853
like a little toilet
in a museum, man.

03:56.897 --> 03:58.888
You know, talkin' 'bout,
dang ol'... ideas, man.

04:00.333 --> 04:03.564
I never could understand a word
of that art mumbo-jumbo.

04:03.603 --> 04:05.400
You know what
I never understood?

04:05.438 --> 04:09.738
Why a pretty girl would model
naked and let someone paint her.

04:09.776 --> 04:12.973
And, you know, if she'd do
that for just anyone or...

04:17.017 --> 04:18.279
What the?

04:24.424 --> 04:26.085
It's me!

04:26.126 --> 04:26.956
Wow!

04:26.993 --> 04:28.392
Don Quixote's Authentic

04:28.428 --> 04:30.089
Spanish Cuisine and Karaoke

04:30.130 --> 04:31.256
went out of business

04:31.298 --> 04:33.892
and guess what
I bought from them!

04:34.935 --> 04:36.596
A suit of armor!

04:36.636 --> 04:38.069
Is it real?

04:38.104 --> 04:39.833
I was hoping
you'd ask me that.

04:39.873 --> 04:41.841
Gentlemen, nine irons.

04:45.745 --> 04:47.269
Ha! Ha! This is amazing!

04:47.314 --> 04:48.804
I am invincible!

04:48.848 --> 04:50.975
Come on, Hank, take a whack!

04:51.017 --> 04:53.645
Well, as much as I'd like
to hit you with a golf club,

04:53.687 --> 04:55.086
I can't do it right now.

04:55.121 --> 04:57.146
I've got to come up
with some art.

04:57.190 --> 05:01.149
Don't be afraid
of the groin, boys.

05:01.194 --> 05:03.958
I don't think those
artists ever shower.

05:03.997 --> 05:05.157
It was like,

05:05.198 --> 05:06.563
just when you thought

05:06.600 --> 05:09.262
you'd never smelled anyone worse
than one guy... Bam!

05:09.302 --> 05:12.362
The next guy smells even worse!

05:12.405 --> 05:14.134
It was awful, Peggy.

05:14.174 --> 05:15.766
Makes me wish
there was some way

05:15.809 --> 05:17.504
to buy art without
the, you know,

05:17.544 --> 05:19.102
artists and whatnot.

05:19.145 --> 05:21.340
Maybe I can help you
find something.

05:21.381 --> 05:23.315
I've always had
an artistic bent.

05:23.350 --> 05:25.818
And I have decorated
every birthday cake

05:25.852 --> 05:27.547
in this family for 20 years.

05:27.587 --> 05:29.578
Yeah, I remember
the cake you made

05:29.623 --> 05:31.181
for Bobby's fourth birthday.

05:31.224 --> 05:32.885
The one that looked
like a train?

05:32.926 --> 05:35.053
Chocolate chip
cookie wheels...

05:35.095 --> 05:36.187
Well, heck, Peggy,

05:36.229 --> 05:37.594
why don't you
just make the art?

05:37.631 --> 05:39.360
It can't be very hard.

05:39.399 --> 05:41.890
I mean, even the people
who do it for a living

05:41.935 --> 05:43.425
don't seem very good at it.

05:43.470 --> 05:45.768
Well, Hank, only if I can
think of an idea.

05:45.805 --> 05:47.500
Now let me think.

05:47.540 --> 05:50.839
Propane... America...
The future...

05:53.880 --> 05:55.780
I've got it!

05:55.815 --> 05:56.873
A probot!

05:56.916 --> 05:58.679
A... A what?

05:58.718 --> 06:00.049
A Probot, Hank.

06:00.086 --> 06:02.953
A robot made entirely
of propane tanks,

06:02.989 --> 06:06.516
welcoming the people
of Arlen to the future.

06:06.559 --> 06:09.119
A future of Arlen pride.

06:09.162 --> 06:10.390
And hard work.

06:10.430 --> 06:13.058
And clean-burning barbecues.
And...

06:13.099 --> 06:14.293
Stop, Peggy.

06:14.334 --> 06:16.928
Can you do it for under $800.

06:27.614 --> 06:30.014
Buddy, you want to stop that?

06:30.050 --> 06:33.417
No, I don't,
you armorless jackass!

06:33.453 --> 06:38.390
And there's nothing
you can do about it!

06:38.425 --> 06:40.393
Dale, maybe we should get out...

06:56.743 --> 06:58.904
You know, I never
thought anything

06:58.945 --> 07:00.242
could put this crazy

07:00.280 --> 07:02.043
propane game in perspective,

07:02.082 --> 07:03.049
but you did it.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.573
So what do you think, sir?

07:04.617 --> 07:06.710
It don't matter what I think.

07:06.753 --> 07:09.244
Could be a statue
of two dogs a-humping

07:09.289 --> 07:12.156
as long as the Zoning Board
thinks it's art.

07:12.192 --> 07:13.318
And what...

07:13.360 --> 07:15.260
Speak of the devil.

07:15.295 --> 07:18.264
Margo, you look just radiant.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.597
Hmm, interesting.

07:21.634 --> 07:23.693
What does everyone think?

07:23.737 --> 07:25.637
Real interesting.

07:25.672 --> 07:27.970
What do you think, Margo?

07:28.007 --> 07:29.941
Mm-hmm, hmm.

07:29.976 --> 07:31.034
And who is the artist?

07:31.077 --> 07:32.772
Voila! Peggy Hill.

07:32.812 --> 07:33.836
Peggy Hill?

07:33.880 --> 07:35.404
Wait, aren't you my daughter's

07:35.448 --> 07:36.881
substitute Spanish teacher?

07:36.916 --> 07:39.749
Ah, so you can see
the Spanish influence

07:39.786 --> 07:40.878
in my work.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.217
Is this some kind of joke?

07:42.255 --> 07:43.222
What?

07:44.124 --> 07:45.056
You're a substitute teacher,

07:45.091 --> 07:46.456
not a real artist.

07:46.493 --> 07:48.188
This is crap.

07:49.429 --> 07:50.726
Complete crap.
Unmitigated crap.

07:50.764 --> 07:53.096
I don't appreciate you
wasting my time, Buck.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.532
Permit denied.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.364
Yeah, but...

07:56.403 --> 07:58.735
I want some art, Hank!

07:58.772 --> 08:01.400
I don't care if you have
to rob a museum to get it.

08:01.441 --> 08:02.840
I can do this, Buck!

08:02.876 --> 08:04.901
Just give me another chance.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.469
Oh, what about your idea
about the two dogs?

08:07.514 --> 08:08.503
Sorry, Peggy.

08:08.548 --> 08:10.038
You had your bite
at the apple.

08:13.853 --> 08:17.789
Well, there goes our ride.

08:22.162 --> 08:25.222
Stupid da Vinci with his
stupid classical training.

08:25.265 --> 08:26.755
Margo'd probably marry him.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.360
Well? Did the zoning
board reconsider?

08:29.402 --> 08:31.427
Not exactly.

08:31.471 --> 08:32.870
Buck's setting up a meeting

08:32.905 --> 08:34.567
with some art dealer
from Dallas.

08:34.607 --> 08:37.405
A guy named Jazz.

08:37.443 --> 08:38.842
So that's it?

08:38.878 --> 08:41.278
Just because I didn't go
to some snooty art school

08:41.313 --> 08:43.009
I can't make art?

08:43.049 --> 08:44.676
Hey, you're preaching
to the choir.

08:44.717 --> 08:46.275
I always liked the probot.

08:46.319 --> 08:48.787
You look at the probot,
he looks at you,

08:48.822 --> 08:52.053
you think, "Hey, things
are going to be okay."

08:53.259 --> 08:55.318
Sure, Peggy can make
a metal man,

08:55.361 --> 08:56.919
but I'm living it!

08:59.299 --> 09:00.766
This some kind of a joke?

09:00.800 --> 09:03.735
Yeah. Knock-knock.
Who's there?

09:03.770 --> 09:05.931
Sweet revenge.

09:05.972 --> 09:07.530
Sweet revenge who?

09:07.574 --> 09:08.563
Get out of here.

09:08.608 --> 09:10.200
Not so fast,

09:10.243 --> 09:11.733
Mister King of Eighth Grade.

09:11.778 --> 09:13.040
Gribble?

09:13.079 --> 09:14.740
Looks like
you didn't count on me

09:14.781 --> 09:16.305
coming back in a suit of armor

09:16.349 --> 09:19.318
when you were throwing
my lunch on the roof!

09:19.352 --> 09:20.614
Ha!

09:20.653 --> 09:23.588
We're going to settle
the score right now.

09:23.623 --> 09:25.022
Cut it out.

09:27.694 --> 09:30.094
You and your flesh skin
can't hurt me.

09:30.129 --> 09:30.925
Can he, Bill?

09:30.964 --> 09:31.555
No!

09:33.233 --> 09:35.394
Uh... maybe we can
talk about this...

09:35.435 --> 09:37.062
Forget it, Bill.

09:37.103 --> 09:39.037
There's no reasoning
with this animal.

09:39.072 --> 09:41.404
This big, fat animal.

09:41.441 --> 09:42.408
This big,

09:42.442 --> 09:43.534
hairy,

09:43.576 --> 09:44.338
fat...

09:45.979 --> 09:47.947
Where is the?

09:47.981 --> 09:49.539
Supposed to be a turnoff...

09:49.582 --> 09:51.379
Whoa!

09:56.756 --> 09:58.986
Yeah, it's Jazz.

09:59.025 --> 10:00.788
Can you tell my 1:00
I'm going to be late?

10:00.827 --> 10:03.694
I just ran into something
amazing over here.

10:04.764 --> 10:06.595
If I am not an artist,

10:06.633 --> 10:08.533
what is that?

10:09.669 --> 10:10.863
Oh, it's crooked.

10:15.108 --> 10:16.541
Are you Peggy Hill?

10:16.576 --> 10:18.134
The Peggy Hill
who created this?

10:19.379 --> 10:20.539
And who are you?

10:20.580 --> 10:22.411
Jazz Colton, art dealer.

10:24.050 --> 10:25.915
Now tell me everything.

10:25.952 --> 10:27.544
You didn't go to art
school, did you?

10:27.587 --> 10:28.611
Didn't need it.

10:28.655 --> 10:30.555
I am completely self-taught.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.990
And so how does an artist
like you end up here?

10:33.026 --> 10:36.086
Well, I was born in
a small town in Montana.

10:36.129 --> 10:38.063
I moved to Arlen
in High School.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.359
That's when I met Hank.

10:39.399 --> 10:40.798
We married two years later...

10:40.833 --> 10:41.561
I've heard enough.

10:41.601 --> 10:42.659
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:42.702 --> 10:45.034
This must be so
boring for you.

10:45.071 --> 10:46.038
Boring?

10:46.072 --> 10:47.664
Ha! It's treasure.

10:47.707 --> 10:51.541
Peggy, I want to buy
anything you can make.

10:51.578 --> 10:53.773
I want to sell your art.

10:53.813 --> 10:54.802
You do?

10:54.847 --> 10:56.178
Everyone is going to want

10:56.215 --> 10:57.546
a Peggy Hill.

11:03.156 --> 11:05.215
So, uh...

11:05.258 --> 11:06.452
that's it, huh?

11:06.492 --> 11:07.823
Just the silverfish?

11:07.860 --> 11:10.158
You don't have anything
for me to exterminate

11:10.196 --> 11:12.096
that's got a little
more fight to it?

11:12.131 --> 11:13.120
Don't think so.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.101
Come on.
Mountain lion? Bear?

11:16.135 --> 11:19.161
Old Rottweiler
you don't need anymore?

11:19.205 --> 11:19.967
Sorry.

11:20.006 --> 11:21.735
What about that old bag

11:21.774 --> 11:23.298
of a wife of yours?

11:35.688 --> 11:36.848
Hello?

11:36.889 --> 11:38.186
Jazz!

11:38.224 --> 11:41.887
So, how's my best-selling
artist?

11:41.928 --> 11:43.828
What? No!

11:43.863 --> 11:46.297
Your stuff has been flying out
of the gallery.

11:46.332 --> 11:49.233
Your latest...
The Prinker... brilliant.

11:49.268 --> 11:50.860
That's why
I've got a wonderful honor

11:50.903 --> 11:51.995
in store for you, Peggy.

11:52.038 --> 11:54.165
A gallery show just for you

11:54.207 --> 11:56.971
and one other special
local artist.

11:57.010 --> 11:58.875
This is going
to be your coming out party,

11:58.911 --> 12:01.004
the night that introduces you
to the art world.

12:01.047 --> 12:02.981
How does that feel, superstar?!

12:03.016 --> 12:05.644
Can I invite everyone
who didn't believe in me

12:05.685 --> 12:07.550
and really rub their noses
in it?

12:07.587 --> 12:09.555
It wouldn't be an art show
without it, Peggy.

12:09.589 --> 12:10.920
See you there.

12:14.093 --> 12:15.583
Yello, Margo?

12:15.628 --> 12:17.289
Uh-huh. Peggy Hill here.

12:17.330 --> 12:20.231
Yeah, the Peggy Hill
you said wasn't an artist.

12:20.266 --> 12:22.564
Listen, I just wanted
to let you know

12:22.602 --> 12:25.935
that she is having a special
gallery show in Dallas.

12:25.972 --> 12:27.098
Mm-hmm.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.505
That's right.

12:28.541 --> 12:30.406
And I can get you in
because you are lucky enough

12:30.443 --> 12:33.276
to know the artist.

12:33.312 --> 12:36.475
My God, art is fulfilling.

12:44.891 --> 12:46.859
Well, I don't know a lot
about artists,

12:46.893 --> 12:48.326
but you sure are
the prettiest one

12:48.361 --> 12:49.726
I've ever seen.

12:49.762 --> 12:51.252
Peggy!

12:51.297 --> 12:52.423
Margo.

12:52.465 --> 12:53.591
You came.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.567
I'm impressed, Peggy.

12:55.601 --> 12:57.000
But between us girls,

12:57.036 --> 12:59.368
I had a feeling your
stuff was good.

12:59.405 --> 13:01.100
Why didn't I trust myself?

13:01.140 --> 13:03.040
Uh, water under the bridge.

13:03.076 --> 13:05.010
Care to enter with the artist?

13:05.978 --> 13:06.808
Bobby?

13:18.991 --> 13:20.185
Amazing. She's
a genius.

13:20.226 --> 13:21.488
Oh, look at this.

13:21.527 --> 13:23.688
I find the only real art comes
from people

13:23.730 --> 13:26.028
who have no self-awareness,
the outsiders

13:26.065 --> 13:28.590
who hover on the
fringes of society.

13:28.634 --> 13:31.933
Oh, there's our
guest of honor!

13:36.876 --> 13:39.174
What an evening, friends.

13:39.212 --> 13:41.180
What a special evening

13:41.214 --> 13:43.045
for art.

13:43.082 --> 13:45.073
You don't discover a Peggy Hill
every day.

13:45.118 --> 13:46.779
It's a rare privilege.

13:46.819 --> 13:48.411
But then it happens.

13:48.454 --> 13:50.615
You find someone
the art world has ignored.

13:51.824 --> 13:53.621
Here is someone

13:53.659 --> 13:56.025
who despite having
no formal education

13:56.062 --> 13:57.689
has been able to touch us.

13:57.730 --> 14:00.494
Her mind lacks the fine tools
of the academy,

14:00.533 --> 14:03.866
but she hacks and bludgeons
with the blunt instruments

14:03.903 --> 14:06.701
of her unspoiled
childlike spirit.

14:06.739 --> 14:09.537
Since that day she came down
from the mountains

14:09.575 --> 14:12.373
and became the child bride
of a simple laborer,

14:12.411 --> 14:15.812
she has been looking for a way
to express her anger

14:15.848 --> 14:18.180
at the world passing her by.

14:18.217 --> 14:21.152
She is angry,
she is practically illiterate,

14:21.187 --> 14:22.654
but like a wounded animal

14:22.688 --> 14:25.054
crying out,
she makes herself heard.

14:25.091 --> 14:27.889
Bless you, Peggy,
for letting us hear you.

14:31.931 --> 14:33.660
What?!

14:33.699 --> 14:35.963
"I ain't got no learning"?!

14:36.002 --> 14:38.129
Oh, God, Hank.

14:38.171 --> 14:39.729
Of course,

14:39.772 --> 14:41.205
we are here

14:41.240 --> 14:43.367
to honor another exciting
new voice of outsider art,

14:43.409 --> 14:45.036
the only artist I've worked with

14:45.077 --> 14:46.908
who can be called
Peggy Hill's peer,

14:46.946 --> 14:49.414
Jimmy Wichard.

14:49.448 --> 14:52.076
Hey, Peggy!

14:52.118 --> 14:54.018
Now it all makes sense.

14:54.053 --> 14:56.078
Peggy, you are an inspiration

14:56.122 --> 14:58.716
to inbred morons everywhere.

15:08.501 --> 15:10.492
I love your work.

15:12.138 --> 15:14.402
I was wondering,
do you feel sad sometimes,

15:14.440 --> 15:16.203
like your heart
has a tummy ache?

15:16.242 --> 15:18.836
Oh, Hank, let's
get out of here.

15:18.878 --> 15:20.971
I'll get Bobby.

15:26.919 --> 15:28.477
Jazz,

15:28.521 --> 15:29.647
how could you?

15:29.689 --> 15:31.452
"I ain't got no learning"?

15:32.892 --> 15:34.951
You did say you didn't have
any formal training,

15:34.994 --> 15:36.655
Montana, high school
sweetheart...

15:36.696 --> 15:39.290
Look, I just spiced everything
up a little.

15:39.332 --> 15:40.697
Oh, God.

15:40.733 --> 15:43.463
So people weren't buying probots
because they liked them?

15:43.502 --> 15:45.697
They were buying them
because they thought

15:45.738 --> 15:47.672
I was some kind
of inbred hillbilly?

15:47.707 --> 15:48.833
Of course.

15:50.142 --> 15:51.609
Let's face it...

15:51.644 --> 15:53.635
middle-class hausfrau stacks
a bunch of propane tanks?

15:53.679 --> 15:55.078
Even I'm falling asleep!

15:55.114 --> 15:56.581
But say it's made

15:56.616 --> 15:59.676
by someone straight out
of <i>Deliverance</i> and kaching!

16:05.157 --> 16:07.352
Hey, you make guys, too?

16:07.393 --> 16:08.621
I make guys.

16:09.762 --> 16:10.888
Don't copy my guys!

16:11.931 --> 16:13.159
No. You got to shake it!

16:13.199 --> 16:15.099
The art don't work
if you don't shake it.

16:21.641 --> 16:24.405
And how's the robot game
treating you?

16:28.314 --> 16:32.273
So, uh, you know, I
bet a lot of artists

16:32.318 --> 16:34.616
had people thinking
they were all kinds of stuff

16:34.654 --> 16:36.144
before they got famous.

16:36.188 --> 16:39.180
Did you see this letter
from the zoning board?

16:39.225 --> 16:40.283
"Dear Mrs. Hill,

16:40.326 --> 16:42.157
"Though the board understands

16:42.194 --> 16:44.287
"you overcame a
lot in your life,

16:44.330 --> 16:45.388
"angry hillbilly

16:45.431 --> 16:47.399
"is not the face of Arlen

16:47.433 --> 16:49.628
"we want to
metal debris promptly."

16:49.669 --> 16:50.863
And look

16:50.903 --> 16:51.870
at the size of this typeface!

16:51.904 --> 16:53.804
This typeface!

16:53.839 --> 16:56.399
That's, uh, pretty big.

17:00.079 --> 17:01.410
It was a great show, Jimmy.

17:01.447 --> 17:02.971
You're going
to be a rich artist.

17:03.015 --> 17:05.483
Hey, what happened
to the stuff I made?

17:05.518 --> 17:06.644
Your art, Jimmy?

17:06.685 --> 17:07.743
We sold it.

17:07.787 --> 17:09.220
You sold the stuff I made?

17:09.255 --> 17:11.223
I want it back!
Give me it!

17:11.257 --> 17:12.416
No. Remember?

17:12.458 --> 17:14.050
We sell it, I give you money.

17:14.093 --> 17:16.060
I can't make new stuff
out of money!

17:16.095 --> 17:18.063
Give me cans! I want cans!

17:18.097 --> 17:19.223
The good ones!

17:19.265 --> 17:20.892
Yeah, the... the smash 'ems!

17:20.933 --> 17:22.594
So, you don't want money.

17:22.635 --> 17:24.329
You want cans.

17:24.369 --> 17:25.496
Duh!

17:25.538 --> 17:27.028
You're the boss, Jimmy.

17:27.073 --> 17:29.132
I'm the boss!

17:30.343 --> 17:32.470
Stay angry, Jimmy!

17:32.511 --> 17:33.671
Oh, hey, Mr. Hill.

17:33.713 --> 17:35.078
Don't give me that.

17:35.114 --> 17:37.582
You made a laughingstock
out of my wife.

17:37.616 --> 17:38.913
And you want what?

17:38.951 --> 17:41.476
I want you to sell
some of her art for real,

17:41.520 --> 17:42.851
without all the lies.

17:42.888 --> 17:44.048
I sympathize with you.

17:44.090 --> 17:45.216
Honest injun.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.588
But it isn't going to happen.

17:46.625 --> 17:47.819
Says who?

17:47.860 --> 17:49.418
It's good art, I tell you what.

17:49.462 --> 17:51.760
And they liked it before,
they'll like it now!

17:51.797 --> 17:53.059
Look, I can see

17:53.099 --> 17:55.158
the inbred hillbilly thing
is really bothering you,

17:55.201 --> 17:56.293
so I'll make you a deal...

17:56.335 --> 17:57.359
I'll say she's insane.

17:57.403 --> 17:58.927
But it's got
to be criminally insane,

17:58.971 --> 17:59.938
or we've got nothing.

17:59.972 --> 18:01.439
No! That's it, Mister.

18:01.474 --> 18:03.772
You just sold
your last probot.

18:05.578 --> 18:06.806
How about syphilitic?

18:06.846 --> 18:08.006
Hook hands?

18:08.047 --> 18:09.776
Transgender?

18:19.925 --> 18:21.893
Oops.

18:23.496 --> 18:25.020
Oops.

18:26.232 --> 18:29.030
Oops.
My beer!

18:29.068 --> 18:31.866
Dale, you did that on purpose!

18:33.372 --> 18:37.240
Mihn, I'm taking your roses!

18:45.584 --> 18:47.279
Soft shells!

18:47.319 --> 18:49.310
Cower before me!

18:50.523 --> 18:51.922
It ends now, Dale.

18:53.559 --> 18:56.960
You can't kick Rainey Street
around anymore!

18:56.996 --> 18:59.760
Oh, sweet, sweet,

18:59.799 --> 19:02.563
stupid, Bill.

19:27.359 --> 19:29.759
Bill, roll me over
so I can kick your ass.

19:29.795 --> 19:33.026
Actually, just
move your ass closer.

19:33.065 --> 19:35.898
Mihn, I believe this is yours.

19:47.313 --> 19:48.837
Hank!

19:48.881 --> 19:51.179
How could you bring
that thing here?

19:51.217 --> 19:53.082
I didn't want
to see it torn down.

19:53.119 --> 19:54.484
I thought, I don't know,

19:54.520 --> 19:56.852
we could put it up
in the yard somewhere.

19:56.889 --> 19:58.254
I want it dead, Hank.

19:58.290 --> 20:01.782
I can't stand it laughing at me,
telling me he's not art,

20:01.827 --> 20:03.454
just a bunch of stupid tanks.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.322
Why don't you sleep
on that, Peggy.

20:06.365 --> 20:08.993
Besides, I don't have the right
tools here, and I just...

20:09.034 --> 20:10.661
I want it dead now, Hank!

20:10.703 --> 20:12.671
I need those tools!

20:12.705 --> 20:14.332
Where are the tools?

20:15.374 --> 20:16.363
Strickland.

20:18.244 --> 20:19.404
No, Hank.

20:19.445 --> 20:21.276
Let me do it.

20:23.082 --> 20:24.913
That's right, metalhead.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.941
This is personal.

20:28.454 --> 20:30.888
All right,
you're making another one!

20:30.923 --> 20:33.289
Hey, honey,
they're building another probot!

20:33.325 --> 20:35.020
So you like it?

20:35.060 --> 20:38.621
Yeah. Every time I drove by it,
it made me feel...

20:38.664 --> 20:40.655
optimistic.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.997
Real? Well, that's
what I was going for!

20:43.035 --> 20:45.094
Hey, we're not exactly
the art types,

20:45.137 --> 20:46.365
but do you think

20:46.405 --> 20:48.965
you could make us
a little probot for our lawn?

20:49.008 --> 20:50.600
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

20:50.643 --> 20:51.837
You make them to order?

20:51.877 --> 20:53.242
You think you could do one

20:53.279 --> 20:55.338
holding a pool cue
for my rumpus room?

20:55.381 --> 20:56.541
Well, sure.

20:56.582 --> 20:58.413
How' bout holding
an American flag?

20:58.450 --> 21:00.350
Yeah, well, hold on, hold on.

21:00.386 --> 21:02.149
I need to write it all down.

21:02.188 --> 21:04.247
Yeah, uh, one at
a time, please,

21:04.290 --> 21:07.987
you know, so the
artist can hear you.
