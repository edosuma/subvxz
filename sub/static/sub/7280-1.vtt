03:36.218 --> 03:38.219
Uh, Charlie-Fox, Charlie-Fox-6,

03:38.720 --> 03:40.723
Roger, be advised...

03:45.727 --> 03:48.731
We'll have resupplies
down by chopper. Over.

03:48.731 --> 03:50.732
Strong shit, man.

03:52.985 --> 03:55.987
Where the fuck are the
God damn gooks already?

03:55.987 --> 03:58.991
I don't think they're even out there.

03:58.991 --> 04:02.243
Jesus, this shit's something else.

04:09.367 --> 04:10.368
Hey, Professor, how many times

04:10.868 --> 04:13.122
can you shit in an hour?

04:14.623 --> 04:17.875
Professor got beaucoupshits, man.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.765
Why do you even bother pulling them up?

04:23.881 --> 04:26.885
You jerking off again, huh, Jake?

04:27.268 --> 04:29.772
Come over here and jerk on this.

04:29.772 --> 04:31.272
Come choke my black root.

04:35.893 --> 04:37.896
Please?

04:37.896 --> 04:39.648
He's asking politely.

04:39.648 --> 04:42.151
Ain't got a fucking tweezer, man.

04:42.401 --> 04:44.903
Oh, ho! Yeah!

04:44.903 --> 04:47.790
Shit! We got movement in the treeline.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.408
Shit!

04:49.408 --> 04:51.042
Movement in the treeline!

04:53.662 --> 04:56.047
1, 3, 2, 0!

04:57.915 --> 04:58.917
Fuck, something's wrong.

04:59.417 --> 05:00.918
What the fuck's wrong with you?

05:00.918 --> 05:02.420
Motherfuck.

05:03.922 --> 05:05.174
It's my head.

05:09.311 --> 05:10.312
Help me!

05:10.312 --> 05:12.064
Get up!

05:12.064 --> 05:14.066
Paul, help me!

05:14.182 --> 05:15.316
Get up!

05:15.817 --> 05:17.319
Help me!

05:17.319 --> 05:20.071
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Get up!

05:21.573 --> 05:22.324
Medic!

05:22.824 --> 05:23.826
Medic! Stop it!

05:27.446 --> 05:28.946
Medic, we need you here!

05:28.946 --> 05:30.833
Come on, man.

05:30.833 --> 05:31.833
Stop it!

05:35.703 --> 05:36.838
Medic!

05:48.100 --> 05:49.968
1, 2, 3, 0!

05:50.468 --> 05:51.853
Fire!

06:13.992 --> 06:15.494
My arm! My arm!

06:15.994 --> 06:17.495
Aw, fuck!

06:38.684 --> 06:39.934
Oh, God.

06:39.934 --> 06:42.069
Fucking shit!

08:56.621 --> 08:57.873
Excuse me.

09:00.241 --> 09:03.744
Do you know if we've passed
Bergen Street yet?

09:06.248 --> 09:07.749
Bergen?

09:09.750 --> 09:12.754
Um, I fell asleep.

09:22.147 --> 09:24.398
Um, all right. Ok.

10:55.690 --> 10:57.191
Fuck.

12:02.257 --> 12:03.892
Shit.

14:17.108 --> 14:18.109
Hey, Chester.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.111
Go back to sleep.

14:23.031 --> 14:25.450
Get insomnia again?

14:25.450 --> 14:27.902
Jake, is that you?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.907
Did you move all the furniture?

14:33.408 --> 14:36.411
I just moved the chair, that's all.

14:36.411 --> 14:38.163
That help?

14:39.163 --> 14:41.166
Yeah, thanks.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.169
So what do you think?

14:45.169 --> 14:46.171
About what?

14:46.671 --> 14:48.172
The room.

14:48.172 --> 14:50.674
Ask me tomorrow.

14:51.176 --> 14:52.927
It is tomorrow.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.931
How come you're so late?

14:56.931 --> 14:59.817
Bud Nash didn't show up again.

14:59.817 --> 15:01.318
Called in sick.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.321
He's always sick.

15:03.437 --> 15:04.938
So I worked.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.441
Got some overtime.

15:07.691 --> 15:10.195
What happened to your pants?

15:11.696 --> 15:13.197
Don't ask.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.201
You look terrible.

15:17.451 --> 15:18.452
Thanks.

16:13.508 --> 16:15.009
Help me.

16:15.259 --> 16:16.378
Help me.

16:22.634 --> 16:24.635
Oh, fuck.

16:29.390 --> 16:30.392
You're up?

16:30.392 --> 16:32.893
Oh, fuck.

16:46.408 --> 16:47.408
What's that?

16:47.408 --> 16:49.793
Your kid dropped it off.

16:50.794 --> 16:52.297
Who, Jed?

16:52.297 --> 16:53.797
No, the little one.

16:53.797 --> 16:55.299
Eli.

16:55.299 --> 16:57.802
Why can't you remember their names?

16:57.802 --> 17:00.171
They're weird names.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.174
They're biblical names.

17:04.174 --> 17:07.176
They were prophets.

17:07.176 --> 17:08.680
Well, personally,

17:08.680 --> 17:11.182
I never went for church names.

17:13.685 --> 17:15.185
What?

17:15.185 --> 17:18.690
Where do you think Jezebel came from?

17:18.690 --> 17:20.575
Nobody calls me that.

17:22.576 --> 17:25.078
You're such a heathen, Jezzie.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.333
How'd I ever get involved

17:28.333 --> 17:30.835
with such a fucking ninny?

17:32.336 --> 17:33.837
You sold your soul, remember?

17:33.837 --> 17:35.339
That's what you told me.

17:35.339 --> 17:36.841
Yeah? For what?

17:36.841 --> 17:38.343
A good lay.

17:38.343 --> 17:40.345
Look what I got...

17:40.845 --> 17:42.346
- The best.
- The best.

17:50.471 --> 17:52.473
So what's in the bag?

17:52.473 --> 17:53.974
Pictures.

17:53.974 --> 17:55.977
Your wife was tossing them,

17:55.977 --> 17:58.980
so what's-his-name dropped
it over before school.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.481
Eli.

18:00.481 --> 18:02.483
Eli. Ee-lie.

18:12.242 --> 18:13.745
These are great.

18:22.886 --> 18:23.887
Yeah?

18:23.887 --> 18:27.392
Look at this baby.

18:27.392 --> 18:28.893
Aw, who's that?

18:28.893 --> 18:31.395
Isn't that the cutest
baby you've ever seen?

18:31.395 --> 18:32.896
Little fat little thing.

18:33.397 --> 18:34.899
That's me.

18:34.899 --> 18:37.402
That's you? Let me see.

18:37.402 --> 18:40.404
No, that's all right.
This fat little thing.

18:40.404 --> 18:42.906
You don't have to look.

18:43.907 --> 18:45.910
Who's this?

18:46.911 --> 18:48.413
Sarah.

18:49.413 --> 18:50.914
Sarah.

18:51.415 --> 18:53.418
I can see what you mean.

18:53.918 --> 18:55.537
What?

18:56.037 --> 18:57.538
Why you left.

18:59.039 --> 19:00.541
What do you mean?

19:00.541 --> 19:03.294
Jake, she looks like a real bitch.

19:05.296 --> 19:07.297
Well, she looked good then.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.299
Not to me.

19:09.299 --> 19:11.301
You didn't marry her.

19:31.455 --> 19:32.957
Hello, baby.

19:35.460 --> 19:36.961
How you doing?

19:54.595 --> 19:56.096
What's wrong?

20:08.358 --> 20:10.361
Is this the one who died

20:10.862 --> 20:12.997
before you went to Vietnam?

20:14.999 --> 20:16.500
Yeah, it's Gabe.

20:18.502 --> 20:20.003
Oh, God.

20:20.003 --> 20:21.506
Sorry.

20:23.007 --> 20:24.509
Took me by surprise.

20:24.509 --> 20:27.511
I didn't expect to see him today.

20:30.381 --> 20:32.884
What are you doing?
Stop it!

20:37.521 --> 20:40.525
I don't like things that make you cry.

20:52.036 --> 20:53.538
I didn't cry.

21:23.984 --> 21:27.488
When there are gray skies

21:29.490 --> 21:32.492
I don't mind the gray skies

21:33.995 --> 21:36.998
You'll make them blue

21:42.002 --> 21:43.503
Sonny boy

21:58.518 --> 22:00.387
Hey, Donald.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.390
In to get your check?

22:02.390 --> 22:04.392
You one greedy motherfucker, man.

22:04.392 --> 22:06.393
Don't you know that?

22:23.044 --> 22:24.045
Hi.

22:29.299 --> 22:30.801
How's it going?

22:31.301 --> 22:33.304
Better now.

22:33.304 --> 22:34.305
Yeah?

22:35.306 --> 22:36.807
I'm going to go home.

22:36.807 --> 22:38.308
What's wrong?

22:38.308 --> 22:39.810
Just one of those days.

22:39.810 --> 22:42.313
My back's killing me.
I'll go see Louie.

22:42.430 --> 22:44.932
Not again. Your boss will kill you.

22:45.066 --> 22:46.817
What can you do?

22:47.818 --> 22:51.322
Well, I'll miss riding home with you.

22:51.572 --> 22:53.074
I was looking forward to it.

22:53.574 --> 22:55.076
Easy. My back.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.579
Come on, Jake,
that didn't hurt.

22:59.947 --> 23:01.449
How do you know?

23:01.449 --> 23:03.951
I know you.

23:03.951 --> 23:06.453
How come you're so tense today?

23:06.453 --> 23:08.955
I don't know.
What can I tell you?

23:08.955 --> 23:11.209
I saw Sarah the other day.

23:11.209 --> 23:12.210
Oh, yeah?

23:13.211 --> 23:15.212
Her knee acting up?

23:15.212 --> 23:17.214
A bit.

23:17.214 --> 23:19.717
So what did she have to say?

23:19.717 --> 23:22.103
Turn on your right side.

23:24.105 --> 23:26.106
How about the other right?

23:26.106 --> 23:28.108
I don't understand you philosophers.

23:28.108 --> 23:29.977
You got the world figured out,

23:29.977 --> 23:32.480
But you can't remember your left.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.980
What did she say?

23:33.980 --> 23:34.981
Not much.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.983
She's like you that way...

23:36.983 --> 23:37.984
two clams.

23:38.486 --> 23:39.987
No wonder your marriage didn't last.

23:40.488 --> 23:42.490
Put your hand on your hip.

23:42.490 --> 23:44.991
Take a deep breath...

23:44.991 --> 23:47.495
And let it out slowly,

23:47.495 --> 23:48.996
slowly...

23:50.998 --> 23:52.499
That's good.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.885
Now turn to your left.

23:56.386 --> 23:58.890
Did she talk about the boys?

23:58.890 --> 24:01.642
She said you're a son of a bitch,

24:01.642 --> 24:04.644
and she regrets the day she met you.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.646
Thought she didn't say much.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.150
That's all she said.
Hand on your hip.

24:09.150 --> 24:11.152
Take a breath.

24:11.152 --> 24:12.653
Easy...

24:14.154 --> 24:16.156
On your back.

24:18.159 --> 24:20.161
I think she still loves you.

24:20.661 --> 24:22.163
I don't think so.

24:23.163 --> 24:25.665
She doesn't stop talking about you.

24:27.668 --> 24:29.170
That's love, Jake.

24:31.172 --> 24:32.923
You should go back to her.

24:32.923 --> 24:34.925
She threw me out, remember?

24:34.925 --> 24:38.429
Your problem is you spent
six years getting a Ph.D.

24:38.429 --> 24:40.681
then went to work for the post office.

24:40.681 --> 24:42.682
What can I tell you?

24:42.682 --> 24:45.185
After 'Nam, I didn't
want to think anymore.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.806
Any other brain but yours, I'd agree.

24:48.806 --> 24:50.307
Now relax...

24:50.307 --> 24:54.311
Relax. This is going
to be a little strong.

24:54.811 --> 24:55.813
That a boy.

24:56.314 --> 24:57.949
That a boy.

25:01.451 --> 25:02.953
I found one.

25:02.953 --> 25:05.455
I think he's still alive.

25:10.961 --> 25:12.462
Wh...

25:12.462 --> 25:13.964
What did you...

25:13.964 --> 25:15.833
What did you do to me?

25:15.833 --> 25:17.835
I had to get in there.

25:17.835 --> 25:19.336
It's a deep adjustment.

25:19.836 --> 25:20.922
Rest a moment.

25:20.922 --> 25:22.422
Let it set a bit.

25:22.923 --> 25:24.424
I had a weird flash.

25:24.424 --> 25:25.809
What?

25:26.309 --> 25:27.310
I don't know.

25:27.811 --> 25:29.814
I've been having them recently.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.736
You know, you look
like an angel, Louie.

25:35.736 --> 25:37.605
Like an overgrown cherub.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.357
Anyone ever tell you that?

25:40.857 --> 25:42.859
Yeah.

25:42.859 --> 25:43.861
You.

25:43.861 --> 25:45.863
Every time I see you.

25:48.281 --> 25:49.784
You're a lifesaver, Louie.

25:49.784 --> 25:51.786
I know.

26:03.631 --> 26:04.632
Mr. Postman.

26:05.132 --> 26:07.134
Mr. Postman.

26:07.134 --> 26:08.635
Where's your letters, baby?

26:08.635 --> 26:10.136
Hey, Mr. Postman.

26:10.637 --> 26:11.771
Where's your bag?

26:11.771 --> 26:14.141
Shake your thing.

26:15.142 --> 26:16.143
Wait

26:16.143 --> 26:18.645
Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman

26:18.645 --> 26:23.150
Wait, Mr. Postman

26:23.534 --> 26:25.536
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see

26:25.536 --> 26:26.537
whoa, yeah

26:26.537 --> 26:30.290
if there's a letter in your bag for me

26:30.290 --> 26:33.044
I've been waitin' for such a long time

26:33.044 --> 26:34.545
whoa, yeah

26:34.912 --> 26:36.413
Where you going?

26:36.797 --> 26:39.299
We don't remember the words.
I'm sorry.

26:47.424 --> 26:48.558
Look out!

27:30.183 --> 27:31.684
Singer?

27:31.684 --> 27:34.188
Please, Elizabeth, sit down.

27:36.190 --> 27:38.691
I need to see Dr. Carlson, please.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.193
Carlson?

27:40.193 --> 27:41.694
Is he new here?

27:41.694 --> 27:44.198
No, he's been here for years.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.704
Not according to my charts.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.707
Do you have an appointment?

27:54.708 --> 27:56.210
I need to see him.

27:56.210 --> 27:58.711
I know where his room is.

27:58.711 --> 28:01.214
Just give me a pass.

28:01.214 --> 28:04.218
Our doctors are seen
by appointment only.

28:04.218 --> 28:06.220
Damn.

28:06.220 --> 28:09.222
I was in the veterans'
outpatient program.

28:09.222 --> 28:10.723
He knows me.

28:12.226 --> 28:13.727
What was your name?

28:13.727 --> 28:16.730
Singer. Jacob singer.

28:18.231 --> 28:20.733
I've got a lot of work here.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.736
Haven't even had lunch yet.

28:41.255 --> 28:42.756
I'm sorry, but...

28:42.756 --> 28:45.259
there's no record of a Jacob Singer

28:45.259 --> 28:46.759
in our files.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.761
What do you mean, no record?

28:49.262 --> 28:50.763
Shall I spell it out?

28:51.265 --> 28:52.766
There is nothing there.

28:52.766 --> 28:53.767
That's ridiculous.

28:53.767 --> 28:56.769
I've been coming here for years.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.272
Listen to me. I'm... I'm...

29:04.278 --> 29:07.280
I, uh... I need to see Dr. Carlson.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.781
If it's an emergency,

29:08.781 --> 29:11.285
we have a staff of psychiatric
social workers.

29:11.285 --> 29:12.786
There's an hour's wait.

29:12.786 --> 29:15.155
Would you just fill out
this form, please?

29:15.155 --> 29:17.657
I don't want any social worker.

29:19.660 --> 29:20.661
I want Dr. Carlson.

29:21.162 --> 29:22.663
He knows me.

29:30.421 --> 29:31.922
Hey! Come back here!

29:43.433 --> 29:44.817
Hey!

29:45.318 --> 29:47.320
Hey, come back here!

29:47.320 --> 29:48.689
Hey!

29:55.078 --> 29:56.079
Look out.

29:56.329 --> 29:57.330
Get out of here.

29:57.330 --> 29:59.333
Hey, come on!

29:59.833 --> 30:00.834
Hold him.

30:00.834 --> 30:02.836
He made it.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.461
Can I help you?

30:13.463 --> 30:14.964
Where's Dr. Carlson?

30:14.964 --> 30:16.967
Isn't this his office?

30:19.470 --> 30:21.721
Be just a minute.

30:25.726 --> 30:28.729
Why don't we step out in the hall?

30:28.729 --> 30:30.230
It's ok.

30:39.623 --> 30:42.125
I'm so sorry.

30:42.125 --> 30:44.127
Dr. Carlson died.

30:45.628 --> 30:46.630
Died?

30:47.131 --> 30:49.133
It was a car accident.

30:49.633 --> 30:51.634
Oh, Jesus.

30:53.636 --> 30:55.388
Oh, Jesus.

30:57.891 --> 30:59.643
When?

31:00.643 --> 31:01.644
Uh, about a month ago.

31:02.145 --> 31:03.896
Just before Thanksgiving.

31:05.899 --> 31:07.401
How'd it happen?

31:07.401 --> 31:08.902
No one really knows.

31:08.902 --> 31:11.404
They say it blew up.

31:12.905 --> 31:13.906
Blew up?

31:14.407 --> 31:16.410
What do you mean, blew up?

31:17.411 --> 31:18.912
I really don't know.

31:18.912 --> 31:22.415
Is there anything I can do for you?

31:22.915 --> 31:23.534
Do you...

31:24.034 --> 31:26.537
Do you want me to get you someone?

31:27.037 --> 31:28.538
No...

31:28.538 --> 31:30.423
I'm ok.

31:46.940 --> 31:48.941
Maybe it's the pressure, Jake.

31:50.443 --> 31:51.944
You know, the money.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.447
Things like that.

31:55.449 --> 31:57.401
Or your wife.

31:57.401 --> 31:59.903
Why do you bring her up?

32:01.404 --> 32:03.906
She's always on your mind.

32:04.958 --> 32:07.461
I never talk about her.

32:07.461 --> 32:10.963
It has nothing to do with talking.

32:14.468 --> 32:16.452
Maybe it's the war.

32:16.452 --> 32:19.006
You can't spend two years in Vietnam

32:19.006 --> 32:20.007
and expect...

32:20.007 --> 32:22.009
Aw, jezzie, come on.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.012
How does that explain
barricaded subway stations

32:26.012 --> 32:28.147
or these fucking creatures?

32:28.147 --> 32:29.816
Creatures?

32:29.816 --> 32:32.819
Jake, New York is filled with creatures,

32:32.819 --> 32:35.823
and lots of stations are closed.

32:40.827 --> 32:41.828
They're like...

32:41.828 --> 32:43.830
demons, Jezz.

32:46.333 --> 32:47.835
Demons?

32:48.335 --> 32:50.336
Jake, honey...

32:50.336 --> 32:52.839
they're winos and bag ladies.

32:52.839 --> 32:54.341
Lowlife. That's all they are.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.844
The streets are crawling with them.

32:57.344 --> 33:00.346
Don't make them into something
they're not, hmm?

33:00.847 --> 33:02.849
These guys were trying to kill me.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.351
They were aiming at me.

33:04.852 --> 33:05.853
Kids on a joy ride.

33:06.353 --> 33:08.355
It happens all the time.

33:13.343 --> 33:15.345
They were inhuman.

33:19.450 --> 33:21.451
Oh, come on.

33:24.771 --> 33:26.557
What were they, Jake?

33:34.748 --> 33:36.249
You still love me?

33:42.405 --> 33:44.091
What?

33:44.091 --> 33:45.675
Do you love me?

33:47.326 --> 33:48.845
Yeah.

33:51.481 --> 33:55.234
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

33:55.234 --> 33:57.988
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...

34:07.498 --> 34:08.998
Hey, where are you going?

34:09.498 --> 34:11.000
Come with me.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.752
Do you have a girlfriend?

34:12.752 --> 34:14.788
Do you like her an awful lot?

34:14.788 --> 34:16.289
Want a new girlfriend?

34:16.289 --> 34:18.759
I live very close to here,

34:18.759 --> 34:22.295
and I'm very lonely.

34:28.719 --> 34:29.719
More

34:29.719 --> 34:30.721
More

34:30.721 --> 34:32.855
More

34:32.855 --> 34:36.609
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

34:36.609 --> 34:40.730
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

34:40.730 --> 34:44.734
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

34:44.734 --> 34:47.987
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

34:49.371 --> 34:52.241
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

34:52.241 --> 34:55.745
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir...

34:56.245 --> 34:57.247
Hey.

34:58.749 --> 35:01.250
Let me look at your hand.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.252
No, thanks.

35:02.252 --> 35:04.136
Go ahead, Jake. Let her.

35:04.136 --> 35:05.638
She's real good.

35:05.638 --> 35:07.640
Come on.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.642
It's fun.

35:08.642 --> 35:10.643
You left-handed or right-handed?

35:11.143 --> 35:12.645
Um... right.

35:12.645 --> 35:14.647
Give it to me.

35:14.647 --> 35:16.649
Ok.

35:16.649 --> 35:19.151
Mm-hmm. Married man.

35:19.151 --> 35:22.154
Please.

35:23.156 --> 35:25.158
Oh, no.

35:25.658 --> 35:28.160
Oh, divorce.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.662
I like that.

35:29.662 --> 35:31.665
You see this here, that split?

35:31.665 --> 35:32.665
Where?

35:32.665 --> 35:34.167
Right here.

35:34.167 --> 35:37.671
It's a paper cut.

35:38.671 --> 35:41.674
Ooh, and a sense of humor, too.

35:41.674 --> 35:43.176
I love it.

35:44.678 --> 35:47.180
Hey, Jake, Jake.

35:47.180 --> 35:51.183
Come on, baby, dance
with me just one, huh?

35:51.183 --> 35:52.685
What, are you flirting?

35:52.685 --> 35:55.187
Hi.

35:56.689 --> 36:02.194
Let's see, this is your heart line...

36:02.194 --> 36:05.198
and your head line.

36:09.201 --> 36:13.707
And your life line.

36:13.707 --> 36:16.709
You have a very strange line, hon.

36:18.712 --> 36:20.714
No, it's not funny.

36:20.714 --> 36:24.718
See, according to this,
you're already dead.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.221
You're out of here, baby.

36:28.221 --> 36:29.723
What can you do?

36:29.723 --> 36:34.761
Just give me your blue
eyes before you go, ok?

36:44.404 --> 36:46.906
Wait, wait. Jake, come here.

36:46.906 --> 36:49.408
Come on, come on, you can dance.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.526
I don't want to.

36:51.028 --> 36:52.912
Come on, baby, shake it.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.919
Come on, man, move those legs.

36:59.919 --> 37:01.421
Move them size 13s.

37:01.421 --> 37:05.424
Those are some big fucking feet.
Shit.

39:40.062 --> 39:41.080
Jesus, look at that.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.582
His guts are hanging out.

39:42.582 --> 39:46.086
You'll have to push them back in.

39:48.455 --> 39:49.455
I have never...

39:49.955 --> 39:53.093
I have never been so
mortified in my whole life.

39:53.093 --> 39:55.095
Screaming like that.

39:55.095 --> 39:58.714
I don't understand what's
gotten into you, Jake.

39:58.714 --> 40:00.716
You're not acting normal.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.470
There's been too many
crazies in my life.

40:03.470 --> 40:05.971
I don't want it anymore.

40:06.223 --> 40:09.225
I'm tired of men flipping out on me.

40:09.359 --> 40:10.861
If you go crazy,

40:11.111 --> 40:13.729
You're going crazy by yourself,
you understand?

40:14.865 --> 40:16.366
What's it say?

40:18.368 --> 40:21.620
Oh, my God. I'm calling the doctor.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.122
What's it say?

40:23.122 --> 40:24.875
It's gone to the top.

40:25.875 --> 40:27.993
Great.

40:28.995 --> 40:30.997
Dr. Forrest, I'm so sorry to bother you.

40:31.497 --> 40:34.000
This is Jezzie Pipkin up on 14-G.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.002
I just took Jake's temperature,

40:36.002 --> 40:37.504
and it says 106.

40:37.504 --> 40:39.004
Could that be right?

40:40.256 --> 40:41.758
Oh, my God.

40:42.758 --> 40:45.511
Oh, my God.

40:49.649 --> 40:51.151
Get out of bed.

40:51.151 --> 40:53.153
I can't. I'm freezing.

40:53.153 --> 40:55.654
Jake, for Pete's sake, get out of bed!

40:59.024 --> 41:00.526
What did the doctor say?

41:00.910 --> 41:04.281
That you'd die on the
way to the hospital.

41:04.281 --> 41:05.781
Come on, up, up.

41:09.419 --> 41:11.421
Hold on, hold on.

41:11.421 --> 41:13.422
You're going to be ok, Jake.

41:15.424 --> 41:17.176
What are you doing?

41:20.180 --> 41:20.680
I need more ice.

41:21.180 --> 41:22.182
I'm freezing!

41:26.185 --> 41:27.687
What's happening?

41:29.689 --> 41:32.192
I need some ice. He's
running a 106 fever.

41:32.442 --> 41:33.810
It's an emergency... ice.

41:35.312 --> 41:36.312
Thank you.

41:36.312 --> 41:37.814
Come on, sam.

41:39.064 --> 41:40.066
Oh, my God.

41:40.567 --> 41:43.569
Oh, Jake, oh, Jake,
don't you die on me.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.071
Sam, help me!

41:45.071 --> 41:46.071
Sam!

41:46.071 --> 41:47.073
I'll help.

41:47.073 --> 41:48.575
Come on.

41:48.575 --> 41:50.075
Be careful with him.

41:50.075 --> 41:51.076
Hold on.

41:51.578 --> 41:53.078
Come on. It's for your own good.

41:53.580 --> 41:54.580
Come on, Jake.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.082
Come on, get him in there.

41:57.082 --> 41:58.718
You're going to be fine.

42:05.475 --> 42:06.475
Hold him! Hold him!

42:06.725 --> 42:09.229
It's going to be ok.

42:09.229 --> 42:10.229
Is he all right?

42:11.730 --> 42:13.232
He doesn't like this.

42:17.988 --> 42:18.988
Help me!

42:21.741 --> 42:22.741
Stop it!

42:23.243 --> 42:26.245
Jake, don't you die on me.

42:26.245 --> 42:28.615
Stop it! You're killing me!

43:00.145 --> 43:01.147
Shit.

43:01.147 --> 43:02.649
What was that?

43:02.649 --> 43:05.151
I'm freezing.

43:05.151 --> 43:06.653
I'm not cold.

43:06.653 --> 43:10.156
Of course not. You have all the covers.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.162
Must be 10 degrees in here.

43:21.667 --> 43:24.671
I'm telling you, Sarah...

43:24.671 --> 43:26.672
if you want fresh air,

43:26.672 --> 43:29.174
you can sleep on the fire escape.

43:29.725 --> 43:31.928
From now on, that window's closed.

43:31.928 --> 43:34.930
It's not healthy when it's closed.

43:34.930 --> 43:36.933
Healthy? You call this healthy?

43:36.933 --> 43:38.435
I'm going to die of pneumonia.

43:38.435 --> 43:39.935
This is healthy?

43:45.408 --> 43:48.912
What a dream I was having.

43:48.912 --> 43:51.413
I was living with another woman.

43:54.366 --> 43:56.870
You know who it was?

43:57.370 --> 43:59.421
I don't want to know.

43:59.421 --> 44:01.424
Jezebel from the post office.

44:01.424 --> 44:02.926
You remember her.

44:02.926 --> 44:07.629
You met her at the
Christmas Party that time.

44:07.629 --> 44:09.665
I was living with her.

44:11.383 --> 44:12.951
God, what a nightmare.

44:17.506 --> 44:20.026
There were all these demons,

44:20.026 --> 44:22.529
and I was on fire.

44:24.029 --> 44:26.533
I was burning from ice.

44:30.035 --> 44:32.037
Guilty thoughts.

44:32.538 --> 44:35.075
See what happens when you cheat on me,

44:35.075 --> 44:37.627
even in your mind?

44:39.629 --> 44:41.663
She was really good in bed.

44:43.950 --> 44:45.435
Go to sleep.

44:48.488 --> 44:51.140
She had these great thighs.

44:51.140 --> 44:55.812
Oh, I thought you said
it was a nightmare.

44:58.314 --> 44:59.314
It was.

44:59.314 --> 45:00.817
It was a nightmare.

45:02.317 --> 45:06.321
It was a terrible, terrible nightmare.

45:09.825 --> 45:12.328
Daddy, what was that noise?

45:20.336 --> 45:22.839
What are you doing up?

45:25.341 --> 45:26.843
It's cold.

45:27.343 --> 45:28.343
Well, tell your mother.

45:28.845 --> 45:30.346
Go back to bed, darling.

45:30.814 --> 45:33.799
Will you tuck me in?

45:35.301 --> 45:37.303
Who, her?

45:37.303 --> 45:39.805
No. Daddy.

45:40.807 --> 45:41.808
Shit.

45:41.808 --> 45:43.308
Good night, sweetheart.

45:46.312 --> 45:48.314
Oh, God. Come on.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.201
Good night, darling.

46:02.212 --> 46:05.214
Ok. Close your eyes.

46:23.149 --> 46:27.102
I don't mind the gray skies

46:27.102 --> 46:29.104
You make the moon...

46:29.104 --> 46:30.573
Blue?

46:32.075 --> 46:34.076
Sonny boy

46:34.076 --> 46:37.412
When I'm old and gray, dear

46:37.412 --> 46:40.283
Promise you won't stray, dear

46:40.283 --> 46:43.752
I love you so

46:43.752 --> 46:45.171
Sonny...

46:45.671 --> 46:46.589
Boy

46:47.589 --> 46:49.091
Dad?

46:49.091 --> 46:50.093
Yeah, Jed?

46:50.593 --> 46:53.596
You forgot my allowance.

46:53.596 --> 46:55.098
Your allowance?

46:55.098 --> 46:57.100
It's 5:00 in the morning.

46:57.100 --> 46:59.468
We'll talk about it at breakfast.

46:59.968 --> 47:02.971
All right, but don't forget.

47:02.971 --> 47:04.973
I love you, Dad.

47:06.475 --> 47:08.477
What is this, a convention?

47:08.477 --> 47:10.479
I love you too, Pickles.

47:10.479 --> 47:12.482
Go back to sleep.

47:12.482 --> 47:14.484
Wait.

47:14.484 --> 47:15.984
Don't go.

47:17.486 --> 47:19.988
I'm not going anywhere.

47:19.988 --> 47:21.991
I'm right here.

47:21.991 --> 47:24.493
Close your eyes.

47:25.995 --> 47:28.997
See you in the morning.

47:28.997 --> 47:30.500
Don't shut it.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.002
Open it a bit more.

47:34.002 --> 47:35.504
There?

47:35.504 --> 47:37.506
A little bit more.

47:37.506 --> 47:38.508
There?

47:38.508 --> 47:40.509
Good.

48:18.531 --> 48:20.633
I love you, Sarah.

48:49.511 --> 48:51.013
Watch the head.

48:52.397 --> 48:53.515
Move it!

48:54.017 --> 48:57.153
Don't think we got a
fucking chance down here.

48:57.153 --> 48:58.620
Declare an emergency. Over.

49:31.937 --> 49:33.439
You're a lucky guy, Jake.

49:33.939 --> 49:36.442
You must have friends in high places.

51:05.281 --> 51:07.649
Let's get down to Orson.

51:07.649 --> 51:10.153
I was going to vote for three,

51:10.153 --> 51:12.154
and I switched to two
with some trepidation,

51:12.154 --> 51:14.156
because she said one over one,

51:14.156 --> 51:17.160
which means number one
of an addition of one.

51:17.160 --> 51:20.162
I think an artist would know that.

51:26.169 --> 51:27.553
Jake?

51:36.928 --> 51:40.817
You're going to be all right, Jake.

51:40.817 --> 51:43.685
Oh, you're going to be fine.

51:48.191 --> 51:50.692
Am I...

51:50.692 --> 51:52.828
Am I home?

51:52.828 --> 51:56.332
Yeah. You're right here.

51:56.332 --> 51:57.700
Home.

52:00.336 --> 52:03.705
Doctor says you're lucky
your brains didn't boil.

52:07.209 --> 52:09.712
What a night, Jake, huh?

52:09.962 --> 52:13.466
You were screaming and kicking...

52:13.716 --> 52:16.718
and you kept saying,

52:16.718 --> 52:19.221
"Sarah, close the window,"

52:19.354 --> 52:21.357
over and over.

52:21.357 --> 52:23.859
And talking to your kids,

52:24.227 --> 52:26.229
even the dead one.

52:26.229 --> 52:28.480
Weird, huh?

52:32.118 --> 52:36.988
You know you melted 50 pounds
of ice in 8 hours?

52:41.493 --> 52:43.629
Am I dead?

52:46.131 --> 52:48.133
Oh, no.

52:50.136 --> 52:52.138
No. You're right here.

52:54.140 --> 52:56.642
Doctor says you got to rest.

52:56.642 --> 52:59.645
You see, he says you have a virus.

52:59.645 --> 53:01.647
That's what they always say

53:01.647 --> 53:04.649
when they don't know what it is.

53:04.649 --> 53:08.404
Now, you just lie here, ok?

54:11.133 --> 54:15.504
You know, you really
ought to get out today.

54:18.006 --> 54:20.008
You can't just sit around
like this all the time.

54:20.008 --> 54:21.509
It's not healthy.

54:21.509 --> 54:24.513
It's not good for your mind.

54:27.149 --> 54:30.151
Go take a walk or something.

54:30.653 --> 54:32.154
Do something.

54:32.270 --> 54:34.022
Go to a movie.

54:34.022 --> 54:36.024
Go enjoy yourself.

54:36.024 --> 54:40.029
One of us should be having a good time.

54:45.033 --> 54:47.419
Anybody in there?

54:47.919 --> 54:48.921
Anybody home?

54:51.540 --> 54:53.042
Who are you?

54:53.542 --> 54:55.544
Fuck you.

54:56.044 --> 54:57.680
Two weeks of this shit!

54:57.680 --> 54:59.180
I've had enough.

54:59.297 --> 55:02.051
Go ahead and rot if you want.

55:08.557 --> 55:11.560
Have a good fucking day.

55:28.828 --> 55:29.828
Hello.

55:29.828 --> 55:30.830
Jake?

55:30.830 --> 55:32.832
Yeah?

55:32.832 --> 55:35.334
It's Paul. Paul Gruniger.

55:35.334 --> 55:37.837
Paul Gruniger.

55:37.837 --> 55:38.837
Paul.

55:38.837 --> 55:41.339
Paul Gruniger. Jesus, how are you?

55:41.339 --> 55:43.843
It's been like five, six years.

55:43.843 --> 55:45.227
Yeah. A long time.

55:45.727 --> 55:47.229
So, what's up?

55:47.479 --> 55:48.848
Nothing much.

55:48.848 --> 55:51.350
Yeah. Well, same here.

55:51.350 --> 55:53.486
I need to see you, Jake.

55:53.486 --> 55:54.486
I'd love to see you, man,

55:54.486 --> 55:56.988
But I've been laid up.
I've been sick.

55:57.490 --> 55:59.491
I need to see you.

56:00.993 --> 56:01.993
All right.

56:12.504 --> 56:14.006
Something's wrong, Jake.

56:14.006 --> 56:17.008
I don't know what it is,

56:17.008 --> 56:21.513
but I can't talk to anybody about it.

56:22.515 --> 56:25.935
I mean, I figured I could talk to you.

56:26.435 --> 56:28.419
You always used to listen,

56:28.888 --> 56:30.388
you know.

56:37.363 --> 56:39.365
I'm going to hell.

56:41.783 --> 56:44.787
That's as straight as I can put it.

56:44.787 --> 56:47.288
And don't tell me that I'm crazy

56:47.288 --> 56:49.792
'cause I know I'm not.

56:49.792 --> 56:51.292
They're coming after me.

56:54.296 --> 56:56.297
Who is?

56:57.799 --> 56:59.801
They've been following me.

57:02.303 --> 57:04.807
They're coming out of the walls.

57:07.308 --> 57:09.794
I can't trust anybody.

57:13.816 --> 57:17.319
But I got to talk to somebody.

57:17.319 --> 57:19.821
I got to talk to somebody,

57:19.821 --> 57:23.825
or I'm going to fly out
of my fucking mind!

57:27.078 --> 57:28.580
Mind your business.

57:42.044 --> 57:44.546
I don't know who they are

57:44.546 --> 57:46.047
or what they are,

57:46.047 --> 57:48.049
but they're going to get me,

57:48.049 --> 57:50.051
and I'm scared, Jake.

57:50.051 --> 57:54.055
I'm so scared, I can't do anything.

57:54.055 --> 57:56.058
I can't go to my sister's.

57:56.058 --> 58:00.062
I can't even...

58:01.062 --> 58:03.064
I can't even go home.

58:03.064 --> 58:06.067
I don't know what to do.

58:06.067 --> 58:07.569
Paul?

58:07.569 --> 58:10.071
Shit.

58:11.073 --> 58:14.075
Paul, I know what you're talking about.

58:16.078 --> 58:17.580
What do you mean?

58:19.047 --> 58:22.000
I've seen them, too.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.002
You've seen them?

58:24.002 --> 58:27.006
I've seen them, too...

58:27.006 --> 58:29.508
Everywhere, like a plague.

58:29.508 --> 58:32.511
My God, I thought I was the only one.

58:33.011 --> 58:34.013
Yeah, me, too.

58:34.013 --> 58:36.515
I thought I was going out of my mind.

58:36.515 --> 58:38.017
I know, I know.

58:38.017 --> 58:42.520
Look, I carry these around
everywhere with me,

58:43.022 --> 58:45.524
but they don't help.

58:46.024 --> 58:48.526
Nothing helps.

58:58.037 --> 58:59.037
What happened?

58:59.037 --> 59:01.540
What happened that night?

59:04.509 --> 59:06.511
What have they done to us?

59:06.511 --> 59:08.513
I don't know.

59:12.017 --> 59:13.518
Profile.

59:13.518 --> 59:16.020
Great. That's it.

59:16.138 --> 59:18.140
Give it to him.

59:45.049 --> 59:47.051
My lucky day.

01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:08.823
Be advised, we have heavy gunfire...

01:00:10.442 --> 01:00:12.694
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

01:00:17.198 --> 01:00:18.700
Five minutes to Da Nang.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:12.397
No, no.

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:14.899
You have to be strong for your children.

01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:17.401
Listen to what she's saying.

01:02:19.404 --> 01:02:21.906
Did anybody see the police report?

01:02:21.906 --> 01:02:23.908
Sounds like a bomb to me.

01:02:24.158 --> 01:02:25.910
The paper said it was electrical.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.412
It was an accident.

01:02:27.412 --> 01:02:28.412
That's bullshit.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:29.915
Someone's covering something up.

01:02:29.915 --> 01:02:32.917
That was no accident. It was set, man.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:37.421
Why? Paul wasn't hated
by anybody in the world.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.424
What about when you went out?

01:02:39.424 --> 01:02:40.926
Did he say anything?

01:02:43.428 --> 01:02:44.930
Well, he was upset.

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:47.432
He thought people were following him.

01:02:47.432 --> 01:02:48.933
Yeah? Who?

01:02:48.933 --> 01:02:50.935
He didn't know...

01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:52.437
Demons.

01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:56.942
Demons? What the fuck
you talking about, demons?

01:02:56.942 --> 01:02:59.944
He thought he was going to hell.

01:02:59.944 --> 01:03:01.946
Why did he say that?

01:03:01.946 --> 01:03:03.948
What would make him say that?

01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:05.450
I mean, that's strange.

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:07.953
What else did he say, Jake?

01:03:07.953 --> 01:03:09.453
He was scared.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:10.955
He was seeing things

01:03:10.955 --> 01:03:12.591
Coming out of the woodwork.

01:03:12.591 --> 01:03:15.093
"They're trying to get me," he said.

01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:18.462
Did he say what they were?

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:32.227
Excuse me.

01:03:32.227 --> 01:03:35.730
In one end and out the other,
huh, George?

01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:37.616
Still a fucking spaz.

01:03:38.734 --> 01:03:40.234
Hope he can hold his dick

01:03:40.736 --> 01:03:43.238
better than he can his bottle.

01:03:46.241 --> 01:03:47.743
What?

01:03:59.254 --> 01:04:01.006
Something weird is going on here.

01:04:01.006 --> 01:04:03.508
Paul isn't the first one who's died.

01:04:03.508 --> 01:04:05.761
Remember Dr. Carlson over at Bellevue?

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:07.145
His car blew up, too.

01:04:07.645 --> 01:04:09.647
Dr. Carlson's dead?

01:04:10.015 --> 01:04:12.517
Yeah. An explosion just like Paul's.

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:16.020
We got six guys here
going fucking crazy.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.522
Well, not me, buddy.

01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:20.524
Ok, but the rest of us are going crazy.

01:04:20.658 --> 01:04:23.160
Think this has something
to do with that night?

01:04:23.662 --> 01:04:25.781
It's got something to do with something.

01:04:25.781 --> 01:04:28.283
We have to go see the Army.

01:04:28.283 --> 01:04:30.285
They're not telling us something.

01:04:30.285 --> 01:04:31.919
Oh, come on, Professor.

01:04:31.919 --> 01:04:33.921
What makes you think

01:04:33.921 --> 01:04:36.290
the Army's going to
give you any answers?

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.794
You'll be butting up
against a brick wall.

01:04:38.794 --> 01:04:39.794
We'll get a lawyer.

01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:42.797
You should find yourself a shrink.

01:04:42.797 --> 01:04:44.799
You're all fucking paranoid.

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:47.803
It was bad grass.
That's all it was, man.

01:04:47.935 --> 01:04:49.937
There's no such things
as fucking demons.

01:04:49.937 --> 01:04:51.439
Come on.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:57.562
Carol, I'm going to
need you with your pad

01:04:58.062 --> 01:04:59.564
in about 15 minutes.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:03.567
Well, I'm sorry,

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.569
Mr. Singer,

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:09.073
but you know how many people come to me

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:11.075
with the injustices of the world?

01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:12.576
It would break your heart.

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:14.830
Mr. Geary, this is very important to us.

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:17.332
The Army did something to us,

01:05:17.582 --> 01:05:19.584
and we've got to find out what.

01:05:19.584 --> 01:05:22.587
The Army? Jeez, what's with you guys?

01:05:22.587 --> 01:05:25.089
This is not a walk to the library.

01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:26.591
This is the U.S. government.

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:29.093
This is red tape coming out your ass.

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:30.479
You know what I mean?

01:05:30.479 --> 01:05:31.979
That's why we're here.

01:05:31.979 --> 01:05:34.482
Do you think you can help us?

01:05:34.482 --> 01:05:37.986
What am I, Perry Mason?

01:05:49.497 --> 01:05:52.000
All right. I'll look into it.

01:05:54.002 --> 01:05:55.504
You think we have a chance?

01:05:55.504 --> 01:05:58.506
I need sworn depositions
from all of you

01:05:59.006 --> 01:06:00.625
and a list of platoon members

01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:02.127
or their survivors.

01:06:02.127 --> 01:06:03.511
This is great.

01:06:03.511 --> 01:06:05.513
I'll tell you one thing.

01:06:05.513 --> 01:06:07.015
If we do find

01:06:07.015 --> 01:06:09.517
that the military is implicated in this,

01:06:09.517 --> 01:06:14.022
you all stand to make
quite a bit of money.

01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:16.140
Not that I can predict anything,

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.642
but class action suits of this kind

01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:21.145
have been awarded fairly
generous judgments.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:23.647
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

01:06:24.149 --> 01:06:27.151
We're not in it for the money.

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:28.153
- That's right.
- Right.

01:06:31.656 --> 01:06:33.658
All right, gentlemen,

01:06:33.658 --> 01:06:37.412
who wants to go first?

01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:03.939
I put a hungry man in the oven.

01:07:03.939 --> 01:07:05.941
It will be ready at a quarter of.

01:07:05.941 --> 01:07:06.942
Ok.

01:07:06.942 --> 01:07:09.310
There's a tossed salad in the fridge.

01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:10.946
Ok. Thanks.

01:07:11.196 --> 01:07:13.198
I got you some apple juice.

01:07:13.198 --> 01:07:14.698
No, not Red Cheek.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:15.950
Red Cheek.

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:16.951
Ah, shit.

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:18.703
Don't drink it all.

01:07:18.819 --> 01:07:19.821
All right.

01:07:21.323 --> 01:07:23.575
Oh, your lawyer called.

01:07:23.575 --> 01:07:25.576
When?

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:27.578
When you were in the shower.

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:29.080
You didn't call me?

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.082
He didn't give me a chance.

01:07:31.082 --> 01:07:32.584
He hung up on me.

01:07:32.584 --> 01:07:35.587
Look, Jake, don't be upset, ok?

01:07:37.087 --> 01:07:39.591
He's not taking your case.

01:07:39.591 --> 01:07:41.091
What? What do you mean?

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:44.095
He said you didn't have one.

01:07:44.095 --> 01:07:45.596
What's he talking about?

01:07:45.596 --> 01:07:48.098
I don't know. He was very rude.

01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:50.100
He said your friends backed out.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.602
I don't believe this.

01:07:51.602 --> 01:07:54.238
Oh, baby, I feel terrible.

01:07:58.243 --> 01:08:00.995
I'd stay, but I'm so late.

01:08:01.997 --> 01:08:04.249
We'll talk when I get home, ok?

01:08:04.249 --> 01:08:05.616
Yeah.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.622
Are you all right?

01:08:11.622 --> 01:08:13.625
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08:13.625 --> 01:08:15.627
You sure?

01:08:16.127 --> 01:08:18.129
Give me a kiss.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.267
I'll see you later.

01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:24.768
Bye, sweetheart.

01:08:43.404 --> 01:08:44.406
Hello?

01:08:44.906 --> 01:08:45.907
Frank, hi. It's Jake.

01:08:46.407 --> 01:08:48.410
I just got a strange call from Geary.

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:50.911
He said the guys backed down.

01:08:50.911 --> 01:08:52.412
What's he talking about?

01:08:53.915 --> 01:08:56.917
Yeah, that's right, Jake, we did.

01:08:57.167 --> 01:08:59.170
Why?

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:02.057
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

01:09:04.175 --> 01:09:06.310
Well, try.

01:09:08.313 --> 01:09:09.813
You know, Jake, um...

01:09:11.816 --> 01:09:12.817
War's war.

01:09:12.817 --> 01:09:14.318
Things happen.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:15.819
Things happen?

01:09:16.321 --> 01:09:19.823
What does that mean?

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:22.827
I thought we were going
to do something, Frank.

01:09:22.827 --> 01:09:25.279
There's nothing to do, Jake.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:28.198
Who's been talking to you?

01:09:30.702 --> 01:09:33.203
What's going on, Frank?

01:09:39.094 --> 01:09:40.094
I'll call the others.

01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:41.095
They're not interested, Jake.

01:09:41.095 --> 01:09:42.595
What do you mean?

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.099
They're not interested.

01:09:44.099 --> 01:09:46.100
We all talked about this.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.603
We're all suffering the same symptoms.

01:09:48.603 --> 01:09:51.104
Listen, the Army's hiding
something from us.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:54.108
We got to find out what it is.

01:09:54.108 --> 01:09:56.361
Uh, Jake, I got to go.

01:09:56.361 --> 01:09:58.112
No, no, no, wait. Hold on.

01:09:58.112 --> 01:10:00.115
No, wait. Don't hang up.

01:10:00.482 --> 01:10:02.483
Jake, don't call back anymore, ok?

01:10:02.483 --> 01:10:04.986
Wait! I can't do this by myself.

01:10:05.487 --> 01:10:06.487
Frank?

01:10:10.492 --> 01:10:11.992
Frank?

01:10:34.733 --> 01:10:36.734
We'll get them this afternoon.

01:10:36.734 --> 01:10:38.236
Have a good lunch.

01:10:38.236 --> 01:10:39.853
Geary.

01:10:39.853 --> 01:10:40.604
Mr. Geary.

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:42.607
Excuse me.

01:10:44.108 --> 01:10:46.111
Who's been talking to you, huh?

01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:47.112
The Army?

01:10:47.112 --> 01:10:49.113
Have they been talking to you?

01:10:49.113 --> 01:10:50.615
Nobody's talking to nobody.

01:10:50.615 --> 01:10:52.617
You don't have a case.

01:10:52.617 --> 01:10:54.118
Keep your hands off me.

01:10:54.118 --> 01:10:55.620
Leave me alone.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.505
You can't walk away like this.

01:10:58.005 --> 01:11:00.008
We need your help.

01:11:00.008 --> 01:11:01.009
You need a doctor.

01:11:01.009 --> 01:11:03.010
The Army did something to me.

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.511
I got to prove it.

01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:07.014
There's nothing I can do, all right?

01:11:07.014 --> 01:11:08.015
Just leave me alone.

01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:09.517
Something's going on here.

01:11:09.517 --> 01:11:11.019
You're not telling me something.

01:11:11.519 --> 01:11:12.770
What's wrong with you?

01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:14.773
I'll tell you what's wrong.

01:11:14.773 --> 01:11:16.774
I don't know you from Adam.

01:11:17.142 --> 01:11:18.643
You walk in with some bizarre-o story

01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:21.145
and demand I check it out. I did.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:24.648
I don't know what you take me for,

01:11:25.149 --> 01:11:26.151
but you've used me.

01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:27.152
Used you?

01:11:27.152 --> 01:11:29.036
I checked with the Army.

01:11:29.036 --> 01:11:31.790
You never even went to Vietnam.

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:33.291
What's that supposed to mean?

01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:35.292
You and your friends are wacko!

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.795
You were all discharged
on psychological grounds

01:11:37.795 --> 01:11:39.797
after some war games in Thailand.

01:11:39.797 --> 01:11:41.800
Don't you see what they're doing?

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.803
We were in Da Nang.
You got to believe me.

01:11:45.303 --> 01:11:46.804
Go fuck yourself, Singer.

01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:08.076
Hey!

01:12:09.577 --> 01:12:10.828
What is this?

01:12:10.828 --> 01:12:12.330
What is this?

01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:13.331
Help!

01:12:13.331 --> 01:12:14.832
Help!

01:12:16.584 --> 01:12:19.086
Come on, get in there, you cocksucker.

01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:22.206
Get off of me!

01:12:33.968 --> 01:12:35.969
You little fuck!

01:12:35.969 --> 01:12:37.721
Mr. Singer.

01:12:37.971 --> 01:12:38.973
What an appropriate name

01:12:38.973 --> 01:12:40.974
for someone who can't
keep his mouth shut.

01:12:41.475 --> 01:12:44.478
Who are you? What do you want?

01:12:45.979 --> 01:12:48.616
We've been watching you
for a long time...

01:12:48.616 --> 01:12:50.117
you and your friends...

01:12:50.117 --> 01:12:52.120
Frightening people with foolish talk

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.121
about the Army and experiments.

01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:56.624
You're in over your head, Mr. Singer.

01:12:56.624 --> 01:12:58.376
Men drown that way.

01:13:03.247 --> 01:13:05.250
The Army was part of another life.

01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:07.251
Let it lie.

01:13:07.251 --> 01:13:10.138
I hope we've made our point, Mr. Singer.

01:13:21.515 --> 01:13:23.268
Kill this motherfucker!

01:13:39.032 --> 01:13:40.667
Help!

01:13:59.938 --> 01:14:00.938
Look out!

01:14:03.057 --> 01:14:05.059
Please give a little something

01:14:05.059 --> 01:14:08.062
to help the poor families.

01:14:27.081 --> 01:14:29.334
You poor, poor man.

01:14:40.594 --> 01:14:44.698
Merry, merry Christmas!

01:14:50.572 --> 01:14:52.072
This guy's really hurt.

01:14:52.072 --> 01:14:54.075
You better get something in him.

01:14:54.075 --> 01:14:55.443
Hi, I'm Dr. Stewart.

01:14:55.943 --> 01:14:57.946
Can you tell me what happened?

01:14:57.946 --> 01:14:58.947
My back.

01:14:58.947 --> 01:15:00.948
l... I can't move.

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:02.332
Get my chiropractor.

01:15:02.834 --> 01:15:04.835
Your back?

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:06.587
Did you fall?

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:09.090
He said he slipped on the pavement.

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:11.091
He may have hit his head.

01:15:11.091 --> 01:15:13.344
Does he have any identification?

01:15:13.344 --> 01:15:14.595
No wallet, nothing.

01:15:14.962 --> 01:15:15.964
He stole it.

01:15:15.964 --> 01:15:17.348
Who did?

01:15:17.849 --> 01:15:19.349
Santa Claus.

01:15:22.469 --> 01:15:23.971
I got to get the bastard.

01:15:26.474 --> 01:15:29.477
It had my son's picture in it...

01:15:29.477 --> 01:15:30.478
Gabe's picture.

01:15:30.978 --> 01:15:32.980
It's the only one I had.

01:15:33.113 --> 01:15:35.483
Get an orthopedic man in here.
Is Dr. Davis on call?

01:15:35.483 --> 01:15:37.234
I'll page him.

01:15:39.737 --> 01:15:41.238
Call my chiropractor.

01:15:41.238 --> 01:15:43.241
We're doing everything we can.

01:15:45.242 --> 01:15:46.243
Louie Denardo,

01:15:46.243 --> 01:15:47.745
Nostend avenue.

01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:57.889
I'll have to move you
to check for injuries.

01:15:57.889 --> 01:15:58.889
No, doctor.

01:15:58.889 --> 01:16:00.892
This may hurt a little.

01:16:00.892 --> 01:16:01.893
No, no...

01:16:03.894 --> 01:16:06.898
I don't have to ask if
you could feel that.

01:16:06.898 --> 01:16:08.398
God damn it. I need Louie.

01:16:08.899 --> 01:16:09.901
Who's Louie?

01:16:10.902 --> 01:16:12.402
He's out of it.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:14.404
Let's take him down to X-ray.

01:16:53.361 --> 01:16:54.362
Gabe?

01:18:54.314 --> 01:18:55.933
Jezzie...

01:18:57.434 --> 01:18:59.187
Get me out of here.

01:18:59.687 --> 01:19:01.188
Where do you want to go?

01:19:01.188 --> 01:19:02.072
Home.

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:03.573
Home?

01:19:03.573 --> 01:19:05.576
This is your home. You're dead.

01:19:05.576 --> 01:19:06.577
Dead?

01:19:07.077 --> 01:19:11.081
No. No, I just hurt my back.

01:19:11.081 --> 01:19:12.700
I'm not dead.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.701
What are you, then?

01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:15.202
I'm alive!

01:19:15.202 --> 01:19:16.203
Then what you doing here?

01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:18.589
I don't know.

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:22.093
This isn't happening.

01:19:22.093 --> 01:19:23.344
What is happening?

01:19:23.344 --> 01:19:25.846
Get me out of here.

01:19:25.846 --> 01:19:27.849
There is no out of here.

01:19:28.349 --> 01:19:29.349
You've been killed.

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:31.853
Don't you remember?

01:19:37.724 --> 01:19:38.608
Careful.

01:19:39.109 --> 01:19:40.111
We're losing him!

01:19:40.611 --> 01:19:41.612
We're losing him!

01:19:41.612 --> 01:19:43.113
Watch it! Careful.

01:19:43.113 --> 01:19:44.615
What the fuck's taking them...

01:19:45.099 --> 01:19:46.317
He's still pretty doped up.

01:19:46.317 --> 01:19:49.319
I don't think he'll
be able to talk yet.

01:19:49.319 --> 01:19:51.322
I doubt he'll recognize you.

01:19:54.575 --> 01:19:56.077
I just want to see him.

01:19:56.577 --> 01:19:58.578
I'll be outside if you need me.

01:20:00.581 --> 01:20:01.581
Dad?

01:20:02.082 --> 01:20:03.584
Hi.

01:20:04.835 --> 01:20:05.835
It's us.

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:11.091
You ok?

01:20:11.591 --> 01:20:12.593
Jake,

01:20:13.094 --> 01:20:14.594
it's me.

01:20:16.096 --> 01:20:17.598
We heard what happened.

01:20:29.609 --> 01:20:31.112
I'm not dead.

01:20:31.112 --> 01:20:33.113
What?

01:20:33.113 --> 01:20:35.616
I'm alive.

01:20:37.117 --> 01:20:39.620
I'm not dead.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.621
Oh. Oh, no.

01:20:42.122 --> 01:20:43.624
Of course you're not.

01:20:43.624 --> 01:20:46.626
You just hurt your back, that's all.

01:20:46.626 --> 01:20:49.630
It'll be fine. It just takes some time.

01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:51.631
A month they said.

01:20:53.134 --> 01:20:55.135
Just hang in there, dad.

01:20:57.138 --> 01:20:58.639
Now stop it.

01:20:59.139 --> 01:21:00.140
It's not funny.

01:21:02.143 --> 01:21:03.144
God.

01:21:04.644 --> 01:21:06.147
What a mess, huh?

01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:12.152
Oh, Jacob.

01:21:12.152 --> 01:21:14.154
I still love you.

01:21:16.657 --> 01:21:18.658
For whatever that's worth.

01:21:22.662 --> 01:21:24.547
Dream on.

01:21:25.549 --> 01:21:26.550
Oh, God, no!

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:28.051
What?

01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:29.553
What?

01:21:34.058 --> 01:21:35.559
Oh, god, what?

01:21:35.559 --> 01:21:37.560
Tell me, what can I do?

01:21:39.563 --> 01:21:41.064
Help me.

01:21:49.072 --> 01:21:50.573
Hold on.

01:21:54.327 --> 01:21:55.328
Jacob?

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:57.831
Jacob Singer!

01:21:59.082 --> 01:21:59.582
Jacob!

01:22:00.084 --> 01:22:01.585
Sir, keep your voice down.

01:22:02.085 --> 01:22:04.087
Where's Jacob Singer?

01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:05.589
Louie, I'm in here!

01:22:05.589 --> 01:22:08.091
Jake? Where are you, Jake?

01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.343
You can't go in there.

01:22:09.343 --> 01:22:10.844
Can I help you?

01:22:10.844 --> 01:22:11.594
Jacob!

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:14.598
Good god, Jake, what have they done?

01:22:14.598 --> 01:22:16.216
Can I help you?

01:22:16.216 --> 01:22:17.718
You can't go in there.

01:22:17.718 --> 01:22:19.603
What is this, the Middle Ages?

01:22:19.603 --> 01:22:21.221
Don't touch him!

01:22:21.221 --> 01:22:22.723
They call this modern medicine?

01:22:22.723 --> 01:22:24.724
This is barbaric. Barbaric!

01:22:24.724 --> 01:22:26.477
All right, just calm down.

01:22:26.977 --> 01:22:29.612
Why don't you just burn
him at the stake?

01:22:30.113 --> 01:22:31.115
You'll have to leave!

01:22:31.115 --> 01:22:33.867
Stay back! Don't come near me!

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:34.484
Stay back!

01:22:34.984 --> 01:22:35.986
Take one step

01:22:36.487 --> 01:22:38.488
And I'll wrap this around your neck.

01:22:38.738 --> 01:22:39.740
Calm down.

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:40.624
Back! Back!

01:22:41.125 --> 01:22:42.376
Calm down.

01:22:43.877 --> 01:22:44.879
Come on, Jake.

01:22:45.379 --> 01:22:46.880
Come on.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.381
You can't do that.

01:22:53.504 --> 01:22:55.005
Make sure that security's alerted.

01:22:59.009 --> 01:23:00.144
You can't do this!

01:23:00.644 --> 01:23:02.145
Out of the way!

01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:04.148
I'm upset.

01:23:04.148 --> 01:23:06.399
I'm really upset.

01:23:06.399 --> 01:23:08.402
That's a crazy man.

01:23:08.402 --> 01:23:09.903
That man is crazy.

01:23:09.903 --> 01:23:12.406
Watch your toes, Jake.

01:23:20.915 --> 01:23:23.917
Well, you've done it
to yourself this time,

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:25.419
haven't you?

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.422
Am I dying, Louie?

01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:31.925
From a slipped disk?

01:23:32.425 --> 01:23:34.428
That would be a first.

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:38.432
I was in hell.

01:23:40.434 --> 01:23:42.435
I don't want to die, Louie.

01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:45.939
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.

01:23:48.442 --> 01:23:49.943
It's all pain.

01:23:52.446 --> 01:23:53.947
Straighten out your head.

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.202
Relax.

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:02.206
You ever read Meister Eckhart?

01:24:02.206 --> 01:24:04.207
No.

01:24:04.207 --> 01:24:07.210
How did you get your doctorate
without reading Eckhart?

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.461
Relax.

01:24:09.964 --> 01:24:12.465
Ok, good. Now turn over gently...

01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:13.968
right side.

01:24:16.469 --> 01:24:17.470
The other right, ok?

01:24:17.971 --> 01:24:21.975
You're a regular basket
case, you know that?

01:24:27.848 --> 01:24:30.850
Eckhart saw hell, too.

01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:32.853
You know what he said?

01:24:32.853 --> 01:24:35.855
He said the only thing
that burns in hell

01:24:35.855 --> 01:24:37.358
is the part of you

01:24:37.358 --> 01:24:39.859
that won't let go of your life...

01:24:39.859 --> 01:24:41.362
your memories, your attachments.

01:24:41.362 --> 01:24:43.363
They burn them all away.

01:24:43.363 --> 01:24:46.367
But they're not punishing you, he said.

01:24:46.367 --> 01:24:48.368
They're freeing your soul.

01:24:48.368 --> 01:24:49.370
Relax.

01:24:51.371 --> 01:24:52.872
Good.

01:24:58.379 --> 01:25:01.381
So the way he sees it...

01:25:01.381 --> 01:25:05.385
if you're frightened of dying
and you're holding on...

01:25:07.388 --> 01:25:10.390
you'll see devils tearing
your life away.

01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:13.894
But if you've made your peace,

01:25:13.894 --> 01:25:16.229
then the devils are really angels

01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:18.232
freeing you from the earth.

01:25:18.232 --> 01:25:23.237
It's just a matter of how
you look at it, that's all.

01:25:23.237 --> 01:25:25.238
So don't worry, ok?

01:25:25.738 --> 01:25:27.241
Ok?

01:25:30.243 --> 01:25:31.245
Good.

01:25:31.245 --> 01:25:32.246
Relax.

01:25:32.246 --> 01:25:33.746
Relax.

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:38.251
Relax...

01:25:38.251 --> 01:25:40.254
And wiggle your toes.

01:25:41.755 --> 01:25:44.258
Come on, wiggle your toes.

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.261
Perfect.

01:25:48.261 --> 01:25:49.763
We got it.

01:25:51.264 --> 01:25:52.765
We got it.

01:25:52.899 --> 01:25:54.401
Get on your back. Come on.

01:25:54.902 --> 01:25:55.902
Easy.

01:25:55.902 --> 01:25:57.403
Ok?

01:25:57.654 --> 01:25:59.657
Now let's just give it a little try.

01:25:59.657 --> 01:26:02.660
I want to see if you can stand.

01:26:08.165 --> 01:26:09.666
By myself?

01:26:10.667 --> 01:26:12.670
You can do it.

01:26:14.671 --> 01:26:16.172
Come on.

01:26:17.675 --> 01:26:20.176
Just give it a try, Jacob.

01:26:20.176 --> 01:26:21.178
Come on.

01:26:24.682 --> 01:26:26.183
Come on.

01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:31.188
Attaboy. Go ahead.

01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:33.691
Go ahead.

01:26:35.192 --> 01:26:36.693
Go ahead.

01:26:43.817 --> 01:26:45.818
Hallelujah.

01:30:51.814 --> 01:30:53.817
Jake?

01:30:53.817 --> 01:30:55.318
What's wrong?

01:30:55.818 --> 01:30:56.819
It's me.

01:30:59.322 --> 01:31:00.823
Are you ok?

01:31:02.826 --> 01:31:05.328
Jesus Christ, where have you been?

01:31:05.328 --> 01:31:06.830
I've been worried sick.

01:31:07.331 --> 01:31:10.334
I mean, it's two days,
and you don't call me?

01:31:10.334 --> 01:31:12.335
I was in the hospital.

01:31:13.836 --> 01:31:15.839
Oh, Jesus. In the hospital?

01:31:18.341 --> 01:31:19.843
Jake, honey, what hospital?

01:31:20.344 --> 01:31:22.845
I called every hospital in the city.

01:31:26.849 --> 01:31:27.850
No, don't.

01:31:28.852 --> 01:31:30.353
What's going on?

01:31:30.353 --> 01:31:33.105
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.

01:31:35.608 --> 01:31:36.609
Hello?

01:31:36.609 --> 01:31:38.111
Is Jacob Singer there?

01:31:38.111 --> 01:31:40.112
No. I haven't seen him all night.

01:31:40.613 --> 01:31:41.615
When do you expect him?

01:31:41.615 --> 01:31:42.616
I don't know.

01:31:43.116 --> 01:31:44.617
Could you tell him something?

01:31:44.617 --> 01:31:46.118
Tell him I was in Vietnam...

01:31:46.118 --> 01:31:47.120
Vietnam?

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.621
There was a secret experiment...

01:31:48.621 --> 01:31:49.622
What experiment?

01:31:49.622 --> 01:31:52.125
I need to see him as soon as possible.

01:31:52.125 --> 01:31:53.626
Hello. This is Jacob Singer.

01:31:53.626 --> 01:31:55.629
I was in-country in '68.

01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:58.130
I was in a chemical
warfare unit in Saigon.

01:31:58.130 --> 01:32:00.133
We conducted secret
government experiments.

01:32:00.133 --> 01:32:01.134
My God.

01:32:01.134 --> 01:32:02.135
Are you there?

01:32:02.135 --> 01:32:03.135
Yeah.

01:32:03.135 --> 01:32:04.136
Do you want to know more?

01:32:04.638 --> 01:32:06.139
Where can I meet you?

01:32:06.139 --> 01:32:07.139
On 128th and westside highway

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.642
in front of a coffee truck.

01:32:08.642 --> 01:32:10.143
How will I know you?

01:32:10.143 --> 01:32:11.644
You already know me.

01:32:11.644 --> 01:32:12.645
I do?

01:32:12.645 --> 01:32:14.648
Yes. Make sure you're not followed, ok?

01:32:14.648 --> 01:32:17.149
All right. Bye.

01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:18.902
I knew it.

01:32:21.904 --> 01:32:24.407
Who was that?

01:32:24.407 --> 01:32:25.908
A chemist.

01:32:27.911 --> 01:32:31.915
Part of a chemical warfare
unit out of Saigon.

01:32:32.416 --> 01:32:34.417
I knew something was going on.

01:32:34.917 --> 01:32:37.420
Jake... please don't go.

01:32:46.929 --> 01:32:48.432
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:33:05.081 --> 01:33:06.450
Jacob?

01:33:07.451 --> 01:33:09.702
Hi. I'm Michael Newman.

01:33:12.589 --> 01:33:13.590
Yeah.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.841
I told you you'd know me.

01:33:15.841 --> 01:33:18.344
I've been tracking you for a long time.

01:33:18.344 --> 01:33:20.846
I wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.

01:33:20.846 --> 01:33:22.349
Why are you following me?

01:33:22.715 --> 01:33:25.218
You're one of the survivors, Jacob.

01:33:29.105 --> 01:33:30.223
Come on. We can't talk here.

01:33:30.223 --> 01:33:32.475
It's not safe. Come on.

01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:39.733
So, first I'm arrested, right?

01:33:40.233 --> 01:33:43.236
Best LSD I ever made
right down the drain.

01:33:43.737 --> 01:33:45.237
I figured, "This is it.

01:33:45.738 --> 01:33:47.741
20 years in the can if I'm lucky."

01:33:48.241 --> 01:33:49.242
That was 1968.

01:33:49.742 --> 01:33:50.743
Long time ago.

01:33:50.743 --> 01:33:53.746
Really. Next thing I know,
I'm on Riker's island.

01:33:53.746 --> 01:33:55.881
Ever been there, man?

01:33:55.881 --> 01:33:58.385
Well, suddenly, they
take me from my cell,

01:33:58.385 --> 01:34:02.389
they throw me in a waiting room
With bank teller windows.

01:34:02.889 --> 01:34:05.392
Four army colonels with
medals up their asses

01:34:05.892 --> 01:34:06.893
are standing on the other side.

01:34:06.893 --> 01:34:10.897
They say to me, if I come
to Vietnam for two years...

01:34:11.398 --> 01:34:12.898
No action, just work in a lab...

01:34:13.399 --> 01:34:15.902
they'll drop all charges
and wipe the record clean.

01:34:15.902 --> 01:34:17.903
I'd only been in jail 13 hours.

01:34:17.903 --> 01:34:19.906
I knew 'Nam couldn't be any worse.

01:34:20.407 --> 01:34:21.407
Shows how little you knew.

01:34:21.907 --> 01:34:24.411
Yeah, really. They had me by the balls.

01:34:24.911 --> 01:34:26.412
Next thing I know, I'm in Saigon.

01:34:26.779 --> 01:34:29.282
I'm working in a top-secret lab

01:34:29.282 --> 01:34:31.283
synthesizing mind-altering drugs.

01:34:31.785 --> 01:34:32.786
Not the street stuff.

01:34:33.286 --> 01:34:35.287
They had us isolating
special properties...

01:34:35.287 --> 01:34:36.790
the dark side.

01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:41.294
They wanted a drug that increased
aggressive tendencies.

01:34:41.294 --> 01:34:43.295
They were scared. They were worried.

01:34:43.295 --> 01:34:45.297
They figured you guys were too soft,

01:34:45.297 --> 01:34:46.800
not fighting up to your potential.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.801
They wanted something to stir you up,

01:34:48.801 --> 01:34:52.805
make you mad, you know,
tap into your anger.

01:34:52.805 --> 01:34:54.808
And we did it.

01:34:54.808 --> 01:34:57.309
Most powerful thing I ever saw.

01:34:57.309 --> 01:35:00.813
Even a bad trip, and believe
me, I've had my share,

01:35:00.813 --> 01:35:03.817
do not compare to the
fury of the Ladder.

01:35:03.817 --> 01:35:04.818
The Ladder?

01:35:04.818 --> 01:35:07.319
Yeah. That's what they called it.

01:35:07.319 --> 01:35:10.322
A fast trip straight down the Ladder...

01:35:10.322 --> 01:35:13.827
right to the primal fear,
right to the base anger.

01:35:13.827 --> 01:35:16.328
I'm telling you, man, it was powerful.

01:35:16.328 --> 01:35:19.832
I don't need to tell you.
You already know.

01:35:19.832 --> 01:35:22.835
We did experiments on jungle monkeys.

01:35:22.835 --> 01:35:24.336
It worked.

01:35:24.336 --> 01:35:26.840
They bashed each other's heads in,

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.341
gouged out their eyes,
chewed off their tails.

01:35:29.341 --> 01:35:30.844
The brass loved it.

01:35:30.844 --> 01:35:33.846
Then they made us try it on charlie.

01:35:40.737 --> 01:35:43.740
We...

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:46.742
took these POWs, you know?

01:35:46.742 --> 01:35:49.246
Just kids, really.

01:35:49.246 --> 01:35:53.750
And... we put them in this courtyard,

01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:57.254
And we fed them huge
doses of the stuff.

01:35:59.255 --> 01:36:02.259
I mean, they were worse
than the monkeys.

01:36:02.259 --> 01:36:05.261
I didn't know men could do those things.

01:36:09.265 --> 01:36:12.769
Anyway, there was this big
offensive coming up, right?

01:36:12.769 --> 01:36:14.770
Everyone knew it...

01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:16.273
Time Magazine, Huntley, Brinkley...

01:36:16.273 --> 01:36:17.773
And the brass were scared

01:36:17.773 --> 01:36:19.276
because they knew we couldn't win.

01:36:19.276 --> 01:36:22.278
Morale was down, it was
getting ugly in the States.

01:36:22.278 --> 01:36:23.279
You remember.

01:36:23.279 --> 01:36:24.781
Yeah.

01:36:24.781 --> 01:36:26.782
So, a couple days later,

01:36:26.782 --> 01:36:29.786
they decide to use the Ladder...

01:36:29.786 --> 01:36:32.288
on one test battalion...

01:36:32.706 --> 01:36:33.706
Yours.

01:36:33.706 --> 01:36:37.710
Just an infinitesimal dose in
the food supply, they said,

01:36:37.710 --> 01:36:40.714
just to prove its effectiveness
in the field.

01:36:40.714 --> 01:36:43.716
They were sure your unit would
have the highest kill ratio

01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:45.167
in the whole God damn offensive,

01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:46.670
and they were right...
you did...

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:49.171
except not the way they thought.

01:36:52.675 --> 01:36:55.178
No one can remember that night.

01:36:55.178 --> 01:36:58.682
I get flashes, but
they don't make sense.

01:36:58.682 --> 01:37:00.200
What happened?

01:37:00.433 --> 01:37:02.434
Was there an offensive?

01:37:02.434 --> 01:37:06.438
Yeah, a couple days later.
It was fierce,

01:37:06.438 --> 01:37:08.441
but you guys never saw it.

01:37:08.575 --> 01:37:10.076
But there was an attack?

01:37:10.076 --> 01:37:12.077
It was a fight, right?

01:37:12.194 --> 01:37:15.165
Yeah, but not with the Cong.

01:37:19.368 --> 01:37:20.370
With who?

01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:31.264
You killed each other.

01:37:32.765 --> 01:37:34.384
What?

01:37:34.384 --> 01:37:36.885
It was brother against brother.

01:37:36.885 --> 01:37:39.389
No discrimination.

01:37:39.389 --> 01:37:41.390
You tore each other to pieces.

01:37:41.774 --> 01:37:43.526
My God.

01:37:43.526 --> 01:37:46.528
I knew it would happen.

01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:48.031
I warned them.

01:37:48.031 --> 01:37:50.532
I fucking warned them!

01:37:53.286 --> 01:37:55.287
Ohh, fuck.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.801
I was just some hippie chemist, right?

01:38:08.801 --> 01:38:10.804
What did I know?

01:38:11.804 --> 01:38:13.305
Fuck.

01:38:14.307 --> 01:38:17.309
I talked to the guys
who bagged the bodies.

01:38:17.309 --> 01:38:20.813
They were in worse shape
than you, believe me.

01:38:20.813 --> 01:38:23.316
They saw what was left.

01:38:28.822 --> 01:38:32.826
I needed to find you, you know?

01:38:32.826 --> 01:38:35.327
I felt responsible.

01:38:37.279 --> 01:38:39.749
The Ladder was my baby.

01:39:16.536 --> 01:39:18.037
I'm going to Brooklyn.

01:39:18.037 --> 01:39:20.040
Not with me, you're not.

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.791
I get lost in Brooklyn.

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:24.294
I know the way.

01:39:24.294 --> 01:39:25.795
Listen...

01:39:25.795 --> 01:39:29.549
This is all the money I have.

01:39:29.916 --> 01:39:31.417
Take me home, please.

01:39:31.417 --> 01:39:34.054
Where's your home?

01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:15.772
Dr. Singer.

01:41:16.272 --> 01:41:19.776
Well... it's been a long time.

01:41:19.776 --> 01:41:20.777
Hello, sam.

01:41:21.277 --> 01:41:23.278
Are you all right?

01:41:23.278 --> 01:41:25.415
Yeah, I'm ok.

01:41:25.415 --> 01:41:29.035
Do you want some help?
I can call upstairs.

01:41:29.035 --> 01:41:31.537
No, no. That's ok.

01:41:31.537 --> 01:41:33.422
Thanks, sam.

01:42:11.277 --> 01:42:12.778
Sarah?

01:42:31.296 --> 01:42:33.299
Jed?

01:42:33.299 --> 01:42:34.800
Eli?

01:43:57.966 --> 01:43:59.969
If you're frightened of dying

01:43:59.969 --> 01:44:01.470
and you're holding on,

01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:05.974
you'll see devils
tearing your life away.

01:44:05.974 --> 01:44:08.478
If you've made your peace,

01:44:08.478 --> 01:44:10.529
then the devils are really angels

01:44:11.029 --> 01:44:13.666
freeing you from the earth.

01:45:33.895 --> 01:45:35.398
Gabe?

01:45:44.122 --> 01:45:45.992
Gabe?

01:45:46.992 --> 01:45:48.493
Hi, Dad.

01:46:09.514 --> 01:46:11.517
It's ok.

01:46:22.027 --> 01:46:24.029
Come on.
Let's go up.

01:46:32.537 --> 01:46:34.040
Come on.

01:47:12.627 --> 01:47:14.130
He's gone.

01:47:21.636 --> 01:47:25.640
He looks kind of peaceful, the guy.

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.644
Put up a hell of a fight, though.

01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:35.651
What's the guy's name?

01:47:37.652 --> 01:47:40.656
Singer. Jacob singer.

01:47:51.666 --> 01:47:57.672
I don't mind the gray skies

01:47:57.672 --> 01:48:00.175
You make them blue

01:48:00.175 --> 01:48:04.764
Sonny boy

01:48:05.363 --> 01:48:09.551
Friends may forsake me

01:48:09.551 --> 01:48:13.555
Let them all forsake me

01:48:13.555 --> 01:48:16.692
I still have you

01:48:16.692 --> 01:48:20.112
Sonny boy

01:48:21.613 --> 01:48:25.334
You're sent from heaven

01:48:25.334 --> 01:48:28.955
And I know your worth

01:48:28.955 --> 01:48:39.965
You made a heaven for me here on earth

01:48:39.965 --> 01:48:44.469
When I'm old and gray here

01:48:44.469 --> 01:48:48.474
Promise you won't stray, dear

01:48:48.474 --> 01:48:51.978
For I love you so

01:48:52.478 --> 01:48:55.480
Sonny boy
