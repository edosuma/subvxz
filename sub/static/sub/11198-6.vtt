00:16.600 --> 00:21.240
Possibly the beacon we detected with the
MALP was activated remotely on impact.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.640
If anyone is in those forward sections,
I doubt they survived.

00:24.720 --> 00:30.720
There should be an indication somewhere
about how long ago they crashed.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.640
Sir, these people are alive.

00:45.720 --> 00:49.280
At least, they're in
some form of cryogenic sleep.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.200
Any civilisation without faster-than-light
technology would resort to this

00:53.280 --> 00:55.760
to cross the vast distances between stars.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.360
Otherwise, it'd take an entire generation,
and given the effects...

00:59.440 --> 01:02.520
We've got a shipload of frozen people.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.960
That would be
the more succinct way of putting it.

01:06.040 --> 01:11.320
Their current states probably
protected them from the impact.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.440
How many do you think there are?

01:23.520 --> 01:28.280
From the configuration of the ship's
exterior, four sections of varying size.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.440
We'll do a quick head count, see what
we're dealing with, then call for support.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.720
Carter, Teal'c, you pair up.
Daniel and I will start in this compartment.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.880
Yes, sir.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.880
Five.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.600
Six.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.880
105.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.080
<i>(whirring)</i>

02:23.240 --> 02:24.960
Jack!

04:26.440 --> 04:28.240
O'Neill?

04:32.240 --> 04:33.760
Major Carter?

04:34.920 --> 04:37.240
Daniel Jackson, respond.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
O'Neill.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.000
Major Carter.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.720
Daniel Jackson.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.560
<i>(screams)</i>

06:08.120 --> 06:12.720
It's SG-4's IDC, sir.
They're signalling that they've got SG-1.

06:12.800 --> 06:17.040
Defence and medical team, stand by.
Open the iris.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.800
- What have we got?
- Both unconscious, but stable.

06:34.880 --> 06:39.320
Get them to the infirmary
and maintain security protocols.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.440
Daniel?

06:41.520 --> 06:45.280
I have to go back. I have to go back.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.480
I have to go back.
I have to go back to the ship!

06:50.560 --> 06:53.240
- No! No!
- Daniel.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.320
Daniel... It's OK. Don't be afraid.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.160
Sergeants!

07:00.680 --> 07:02.840
It's OK.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.920
Who are you?

07:05.760 --> 07:08.160
What is this place?

07:22.720 --> 07:26.800
Notify me the moment
they regain consciousness.

07:34.240 --> 07:39.640
Who is responsible for this?
I demand to know why this has happened!

07:40.560 --> 07:42.960
Why am I a prisoner?

07:43.040 --> 07:45.480
Those may be removed
when you calm down.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.040
Calm? How do you expect me to be calm?

07:48.120 --> 07:52.040
I was made promises
that nothing could go wrong.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.200
All right, let's start there.
Tell me what has gone wrong.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.320
What has gone wrong.
What has gone wrong.

07:57.400 --> 08:02.160
<i>Well, this is not the Stromos, you are not
a member of my staff, and that is not me!</i>

08:02.240 --> 08:05.320
All right, listen carefully.
We did not do this.

08:05.400 --> 08:09.000
We're in the dark about what
has happened as much as you are.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.960
- If you cooperate...
- I will undergo no more of your tests.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.920
- Are you in pain?
- Yes!

08:19.560 --> 08:21.440
Yes, a great deal.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.080
All right. I'll get something.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.960
In the meantime, try to stay calm,
or you'll be restrained further.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.240
You have no idea who I am, do you?

08:38.159 --> 08:42.280
- That is not Daniel Jackson.
- But is he a Goa'uld?

08:42.360 --> 08:45.520
No, sir, although at the moment
he's every bit as arrogant.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.760
Then is he suffering from
some sort of mental illness?

08:48.840 --> 08:53.360
I don't know yet, sir. His preliminary EEG
readings are like nothing I've ever seen.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.240
There's indication of coma,
but at the same time,

08:56.320 --> 09:01.200
we're seeing readings like those of
a dozen people all jumbled together.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.680
- Is his condition life-threatening?
- I couldn't even guess.

09:08.560 --> 09:12.640
He claims to be a passenger from
the crashed alien vessel we discovered.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.080
- How's that possible?
- I have no idea, but Teal'c is right.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.920
And we're dealing with
more than one passenger.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.040
Daniel's behaviour in the gate room
and throughout the preliminary testing

09:23.120 --> 09:25.520
was distinctly different than now.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.640
I'd say we've witnessed at least two,
maybe even three, personalities.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.200
Could there be more?

09:31.280 --> 09:35.880
We discovered several hundred
passengers in cryogenic suspension.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.200
O'Neill requested an enumeration
of the cryogenic chambers.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.280
We separated and I lost consciousness
momentarily. For what reason, I'm unsure.

09:55.360 --> 10:00.120
When I returned, I found Daniel Jackson,
O'Neill and Carter in their current states.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.120
Speaking of which, sir, I'd like
to check in on the colonel and Sam.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.040
- Keep me apprised.
- Yes, sir.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.640
Maybe you should head down
to the infirmary.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.640
I intend to remain here.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.320
Very well.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.600
- I'm ordinarily a very rational man.
- Of course, Dr Jackson.

10:23.680 --> 10:27.080
I am a sovereign of Talthus.
My name is Martice.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.240
Beg your pardon, sir.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.120
Oh, "sir". Well, that's a start.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.000
Pupils are still a little dilated.

10:39.080 --> 10:43.160
It's as though they were struck with
some sort of powerful zat weapon.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.480
- At least their EEGs are still normal.
- Oi!

10:46.560 --> 10:48.560
Doctor?

10:49.480 --> 10:53.200
Inform General Hammond
the colonel's awake.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.240
- Hey, Doc.
- How are you feeling, sir?

10:57.320 --> 10:59.120
Headache. Bad.

10:59.760 --> 11:05.040
I can take care of that, but first
I need to know if you're feeling... yourself.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.920
Well, other than this nail
through my head, I'm fine.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.360
- Why?
- I'll explain later.

11:12.440 --> 11:16.960
Teal'c got the three of you to the Stargate
from the ship. My team took it from there.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.000
Carter and Daniel?

11:19.080 --> 11:24.080
Major Carter is suffering
the same aftereffects as you, sir.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.520
Janet?

11:25.600 --> 11:26.840
Sam.

11:27.880 --> 11:32.960
Hey. It's gonna be fine. You've both
suffered some sort of neural shock.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.320
Colonel, Major, how are you feeling?

11:40.400 --> 11:44.960
- Got a nail in my head, sir.
- That sounds like our Colonel O'Neill.

11:45.040 --> 11:49.240
Their EEGs show normal brain activity.
They appear to be unaffected.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.280
Unaffected by what?

11:55.560 --> 11:58.160
Where's Daniel?

11:58.760 --> 12:02.360
I need you to stay where you are,
at least until you're strong enough.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.920
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not, sir.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.480
Ow.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.800
No, I'm not.

12:12.480 --> 12:17.160
Just find the small woman and tell her that
what she gave me is not good enough.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.240
It isn't working.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.200
Do you speak?

12:34.640 --> 12:37.840
- How are you feeling now?
- Your medicine is worthless.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.920
Are you still in pain?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.400
- This body must be damaged.
- I doubt that.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.120
Dr Jackson was in perfect health.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.200
I assume Dr Jackson was the former.

12:51.680 --> 12:57.680
Not that I have anything against it.
It's younger and stronger than my own.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.880
Did something happen to my own body?

13:02.920 --> 13:07.160
In times of disaster, people need their
sovereign. How will they recognise me?

13:07.240 --> 13:11.720
- I've already told you we didn't do this.
- How else could I be in this situation?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.520
We don't know.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.560
How useful you are.

13:25.600 --> 13:30.160
- What is this place?
- It's one of our medical isolation rooms.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.200
Could you be less specific?

13:32.320 --> 13:35.920
In a military facility
on a planet called Earth.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.480
Earth.

13:38.560 --> 13:42.000
The ship was bound for Ardena.
How far are we from Ardena?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.080
I don't know.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.200
The other passengers...

13:50.560 --> 13:53.080
they will be concerned for me.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.040
As I am for them, of course.

13:57.240 --> 14:03.840
Most of them are still on the ship, but we
think several of them may be with us now.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.960
- As prisoners?
- No, we think they may be in this room.

14:08.400 --> 14:13.600
We don't know the reason, but several of
the passengers in cryogenic sleep have...

14:15.160 --> 14:17.680
What's happening?

14:17.760 --> 14:19.400
Martice?

14:24.080 --> 14:27.680
No, Martice is a sovereign.
I'm just a crew member.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.680
Is that...?

14:50.520 --> 14:54.920
- How can this be?
- It's all right. I'm here to help you.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.520
No, no. This is wrong.
This is a mistake.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.000
Yes, it is, one that we want to correct.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.080
I'm Dr Fraiser.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.960
I am Tryan. Engineer, second rank.

15:07.040 --> 15:11.120
All right, Tryan, why don't we start again?

15:13.760 --> 15:15.560
Again?

15:22.160 --> 15:24.760
<i>I don't recognise this man.</i>

15:29.240 --> 15:32.240
Or, rather, myself.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.400
His name is Daniel Jackson. The body
you're inhabiting belongs to him.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.840
<i>- He wasn't aboard the Stromos.
- No.</i>

15:40.600 --> 15:43.960
Then how can I have
ended up in his body?

15:44.040 --> 15:48.080
Your ship crashed
on a planet that we call P2A-347.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.360
We don't know how or why
the crash occurred,

15:50.440 --> 15:53.560
only that the only survivors
were those in cryogenic sleep.

15:53.640 --> 15:57.720
When Daniel Jackson and the other
members of his team boarded your ship,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.800
this happened.

16:01.560 --> 16:06.160
- I have no memory of coming here.
- What do you remember?

16:07.960 --> 16:11.040
Brace for acceleration. Tryan?

16:11.120 --> 16:14.600
- Compartment is secure, sir.
- Very well.

16:22.320 --> 16:28.800
Leaving Talthus, entering my sleep
chamber, then seeing your face here.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.640
- Why am I restrained?
- It wasn't you.

16:32.720 --> 16:37.160
You're the fourth personality to emerge
since being brought back.

16:37.240 --> 16:41.840
We believe that there are others
from your ship in there along with you.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.280
- In one body?
- Plus Dr Jackson.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.960
No. The strain on the body
would be too great. It wouldn't survive.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.800
- Do you know that for certain?
- The only result would be insanity.

16:51.880 --> 16:56.280
- Then we should both hope you're wrong.
- What's happened is impossible.

16:56.360 --> 17:00.080
This can't happen. One cannot return
to any other body than one's own.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.080
There are fail-safes
to prevent that from happening.

17:03.160 --> 17:08.040
It has happened.
Look in the mirror to prove it to yourself.

17:11.760 --> 17:16.319
We don't have a lot of time, and you're
the first personality that's been helpful,

17:16.400 --> 17:21.000
so I need you to think, all right?
How could this happen?

17:23.480 --> 17:30.000
A sleeper's consciousness is stored in the
same memory that maintains their body.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.400
There is simply no way to separate them

17:32.480 --> 17:38.000
or send the consciousness to any other
than its corresponding body, unless...

17:38.080 --> 17:40.080
Oh, no.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.720
Unless the sleepers' bodies are dead.

17:56.600 --> 18:01.960
O'Neill. Major Carter.
I am pleased to see you have recovered.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.280
- How is he?
- Yet another personality has emerged.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.280
- Dr Fraiser seems to be making progress.
- How did he get stuck in here?

18:09.360 --> 18:13.640
Daniel Jackson's preliminary
electroencephalogram proved anomalous.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.320
I dare you to say that again.

18:17.240 --> 18:21.600
Dr Fraiser declared a code 17. Dr Jackson
has been under constant guard.

18:21.680 --> 18:26.480
Only she and a few of her staff have
had any direct contact as a precaution.

18:26.560 --> 18:30.680
- She thought he was a Goa'uld?
- Not any more, but I'm taking no chances

18:30.760 --> 18:35.080
until we determine how these persons
have found their way into Dr Jackson.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.040
I'd need another look
at their cryogenic systems.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.520
Schedule a mission briefing
with Dr Fraiser.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.440
Sir, I'd like to stick it out here with Daniel.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.320
Only medical personnel
are allowed access.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.000
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.480
Let's not jump to conclusions.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.160
I'm sorry. There's simply no other way
this could have happened.

19:08.240 --> 19:13.440
Only then can the fail-safes be overridden
and the consciousness leave the system.

19:13.520 --> 19:17.520
I am dead, as are the others
who may reside in this body.

19:17.600 --> 19:22.400
- We can't be sure till we go to the planet.
- Well, you will see.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.360
Help me out with something here.

19:25.440 --> 19:29.080
Why separate the consciousness
from the body in the cryosleep process?

19:29.160 --> 19:33.800
A consciousness can't survive restoration
without loss of memory and intellect.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.840
A person taking such a journey without
proper storage of their consciousness

19:37.920 --> 19:43.400
would arrive as a fraction of themselves.
The essence of that person would be lost.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.000
So the memory requirement
must be enormous.

19:46.080 --> 19:51.720
Each cryogenic capsule contains a matrix
memory module to sustain one mind.

19:51.800 --> 19:56.360
Its systems are connected with those that
sustain the corresponding sleeper's body.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.400
Then it may be possible to upload your
consciousness back into that memory.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.760
- Each module stores one consciousness.
- Do it one at a time.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.840
No, that's not possible. Here.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.200
Could these water molecules be returned
to this glass just as they were before,

20:18.280 --> 20:21.640
in precisely the same configuration?

20:27.680 --> 20:29.080
No.

20:29.160 --> 20:34.480
Our minds were blended, poured into one
vessel ill-equipped to sustain our volume.

20:34.560 --> 20:39.280
But if the computers on your ship can
separate the human mind from the body,

20:39.360 --> 20:42.320
- then surely they can isolate...
- Can you hear that?

20:42.400 --> 20:45.280
No, I can't hear anything.

20:45.360 --> 20:50.120
The others, their voices, I can hear them.
They're getting louder.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.080
I need you to stay with me.
We need to work together.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.720
- It feels incredible.
- The others can't help.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.960
- No one can help.
- Don't say that.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.840
They're pulling at me now.
I don't know how...

21:10.000 --> 21:11.720
Janet?

21:11.800 --> 21:15.440
- Daniel?
- What's going on?

21:15.520 --> 21:21.520
Something has happened. I need you to
just stay with me, OK? Just hang in there.

21:23.960 --> 21:28.400
That's it. A moment later, another person
emerged, but we learnt nothing from her.

21:28.480 --> 21:32.080
So, he only surfaced for a moment,
but it was definitely Daniel.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.760
- At least we know he's still in there.
- Mm-hm.

21:34.840 --> 21:39.080
Dr MacKenzie just did a detailed analysis
of his EEG and MRI readings.

21:39.160 --> 21:43.360
We think Daniel is in a sort of coma,
having been suppressed by the others.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.640
It's like his consciousness
has retreated, protecting itself.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.400
That's why he could
only surface for a short time.

21:49.480 --> 21:53.760
- The other signals are a jumbled mess.
- How many others are there?

21:53.840 --> 21:58.480
Dr MacKenzie believes Daniel could be
carrying the minds of as many as a dozen

21:58.560 --> 22:00.760
of the ship's passengers.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.400
Maybe I could reconfigure
the ship's systems to separate Daniel.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.640
You were attacked on that ship.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.720
<i>- It may have been automated defences.
- (Teal'c) I think not, Major Carter.</i>

22:10.800 --> 22:15.760
I discovered Daniel at the base of one of
the sleep chambers. The door was open.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.200
Daniel wouldn't have
stepped in on his own.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.040
Then someone else must have done so.

22:21.120 --> 22:25.200
Perhaps I regained consciousness before
his assailant could do the same to us.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.240
The question is, why?

22:28.320 --> 22:31.800
Tryan seemed absolutely sure
that his physical body was dead.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.600
So?

22:33.680 --> 22:37.000
What if this was a desperate attempt
to preserve these people?

22:37.080 --> 22:41.040
What if your attacker was trying to keep
these people alive the only way he could?

22:41.120 --> 22:44.040
The ship could not have
sustained them indefinitely.

22:44.120 --> 22:48.080
- So Daniel's a lifeboat?
- Yeah, it's possible.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.720
Sir, I recommend that SG-12
accompany us back to the planet.

22:51.800 --> 22:56.240
They can search the ship for whoever did
this while I study the cryogenic systems.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.800
You have a go. Dismissed.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.520
<i>(Dr Fraiser) I don't think
we've had a chance to meet.</i>

23:11.600 --> 23:13.600
<i>Where's my father?.</i>

23:13.680 --> 23:17.920
I'm sorry, I don't know.
Do you mind if I sit down beside you?

23:20.280 --> 23:21.880
<i>OK.</i>

23:23.720 --> 23:26.920
<i>- There.
- What about them?</i>

23:27.000 --> 23:29.240
Oh, no, they won't hurt you.

23:34.120 --> 23:39.160
Why don't I tell you everything I know,
and then we'll just take it from there, OK?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.720
What's your name?

23:43.840 --> 23:45.960
- Keenin.
- Keenin?

23:46.040 --> 23:49.640
That's a very nice name.
I'm Dr Fraiser.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.360
SG-12, move out.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.760
I know you'd do anything
to save Dr Jackson,

23:58.840 --> 24:01.560
but the last thing we need
is for this to happen to you.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.840
We intend to avoid that, sir.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.920
Good luck.

24:12.320 --> 24:17.000
Keenin, we're trying to figure out
all we can about how this happened.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.120
What's the last thing you remember?

24:20.200 --> 24:22.440
My father.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.880
Why can't I wait with you?

24:28.960 --> 24:34.520
The ship must accelerate to escape
the flare's radiation. You'll be safer here.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.840
You will dream sweet dreams,

24:37.920 --> 24:42.640
and when you awaken,
we'll be in orbit around Ardena,

24:42.720 --> 24:45.280
and I will be right here.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.320
Talthus will be gone.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.680
Hundreds of years
will have passed, Keenin,

24:51.760 --> 24:56.760
and all of this hardship
will be part of our distant history.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.400
Do you understand?

25:07.240 --> 25:09.040
Now...

25:11.080 --> 25:13.400
close your eyes.

25:19.680 --> 25:24.080
- I wanted to stay on Talthus.
- So you had to leave?

25:24.160 --> 25:28.040
They knew it was gonna happen
since a long time before I was born.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.800
- Do you know what a dark star is?
- Mm-hm. One that's burned out its fuel.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.560
They said it would pass
close enough to our sun to make it flare

25:36.640 --> 25:38.960
and that it would engulf Talthus.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.360
I knew my whole life
that the world was gonna end.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.000
<i>So your people built the "Stromos".</i>

25:45.080 --> 25:50.040
<i>They built three ships, including
the Stromos, but it wasn't enough.</i>

25:50.120 --> 25:53.800
They had a lottery, and they said
that was the only fair way.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.280
<i>But my father was
an officer on the Stromos,</i>

25:56.360 --> 26:00.640
so he was allowed to pick
one person from his family.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.520
M-m-my mother made him choose me.

26:05.720 --> 26:06.760
It's all right.

26:06.840 --> 26:12.600
My mother said she'd take her chance
with the lottery, but she wasn't chosen.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.760
The sovereigns were chosen,
but she wasn't chosen.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.720
No one I knew was chosen.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.840
I wanted to stay with her.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.560
It's OK. Shh. It's all right.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.200
<i>It's all right. Shh. It's OK.</i>

26:37.480 --> 26:39.960
What are you doing?

26:40.920 --> 26:42.720
Martice?

26:47.200 --> 26:52.000
You may address me as Sovereign,
and I will ask you never to do that again.

26:53.800 --> 26:57.800
Now, what have you done to resolve this?

27:07.840 --> 27:09.840
SG-12, this is Carter. Come in.

27:09.920 --> 27:15.360
<i>- This is SG-12. We just began our search.
- Stay in radio contact. Carter out.</i>

27:15.440 --> 27:21.040
These power levels are extremely low.
I don't know how it could still be working.

27:21.120 --> 27:24.840
Perhaps if we revived one of them,
they may be of some assistance.

27:24.920 --> 27:29.120
I don't think there's even
enough power to do that.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.520
<i>I demand to speak
to someone in authority.</i>

27:33.600 --> 27:36.080
<i>Well, I'm sorry. You're stuck with me.</i>

27:36.160 --> 27:38.760
<i>Why have you involved the boy in this?</i>

27:38.840 --> 27:41.000
What boy?

27:41.080 --> 27:44.280
The boy. You were just talking to him.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.760
Where is he?

27:51.600 --> 27:55.720
If we don't get these systems hooked up
to a power source, these people will die.

27:55.800 --> 28:00.400
I'll need a naqahdah generator,
and I'll have to build...

28:00.480 --> 28:02.480
<i>(footsteps)</i>

28:06.440 --> 28:09.520
<i>(Carter) One generator should be enough.</i>

28:13.960 --> 28:16.040
Please, don't hurt us.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.800
Tell them to stop shouting.
It is unendurable.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.600
I can't hear them.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.400
<i>Be silent!</i>

28:37.480 --> 28:40.320
- They're in your mind, Martice.
- No.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

28:41.880 --> 28:47.160
What you say, it cannot be so.
I have responsibilities to attend to.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.440
- I cannot remain here.
- You cannot leave.

28:49.520 --> 28:53.400
3,000 of our people depend on me
to lead them. I am the sovereign.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.280
- I'm sorry.
- It is my destiny to rule over Ardena!

28:56.360 --> 28:59.400
You don't understand
the seriousness of your condition.

28:59.480 --> 29:03.360
- You don't realise who you are talking to.
- I don't give a damn.

29:03.440 --> 29:08.720
You don't belong in that man's body,
and I intend to take it back.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.880
<i>(Teal'c) Are there other conscious people?</i>

29:16.960 --> 29:18.440
No.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.920
The others still sleep.

29:21.880 --> 29:25.080
- Why have you come back?
- You did something to one of our people.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.680
<i>- Is he here with you?
- (Teal'c) He is not.</i>

29:27.760 --> 29:30.560
Are you the one responsible?

29:32.200 --> 29:35.400
There was... no choice...

29:36.400 --> 29:38.720
no other way.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.720
- You must do the same.
- I don't think so.

29:42.800 --> 29:48.000
The ship's power is failing.
It is the only way we can save them.

29:49.680 --> 29:54.240
Pharrin figured out a way
to override the fail-safes.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.320
It can be done. Don't you see?

29:57.400 --> 30:02.960
These souls are the last of an entire world.
They cannot be allowed to end like this.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.680
- Maybe there's another way.
- No. No.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.560
Power is fading even now
in every compartment.

30:08.640 --> 30:13.600
If you carried a handful of souls, we could
route the remaining power to the others.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.400
That's not gonna happen.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.360
We do not know how many more
we can accommodate.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.240
"We"?

30:23.480 --> 30:26.840
I believe he too
carries the consciousness of many.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.240
13 souls now reside in Pharrin's body.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.640
I fear I can harbour no more.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.120
Why do you attempt to preserve
these lives? Their bodies are dead.

30:37.200 --> 30:41.880
We are the last of an entire world.
The other ships will come.

30:41.960 --> 30:46.480
We have sent a message.
They will hear it and they will come.

30:46.560 --> 30:49.360
And when they do
they will find a way to restore us.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.120
Why did you not attempt
to revive the others?

30:54.960 --> 30:59.760
<i>(Pharrin) After the ship crashed -
we still don't know why it happened -</i>

30:59.840 --> 31:05.000
<i>he was revived by the computer, but
the power requirement of his restoration</i>

31:05.080 --> 31:08.640
<i>caused too great a drain
in the rest of the compartment.</i>

31:08.720 --> 31:11.440
<i>Power levels were dropping.</i>

31:11.520 --> 31:16.160
<i>Pharrin had only minutes to restore power
to 12 of the sleeper chambers</i>

31:16.240 --> 31:19.400
<i>before the occupants were dead.</i>

31:19.480 --> 31:22.240
<i>But there wasn't enough time.</i>

31:22.320 --> 31:25.720
<i>Pharrin was failing them one by one.</i>

31:26.600 --> 31:30.400
<i>There was no other choice.</i>

31:30.480 --> 31:33.200
<i>No other way to preserve us.</i>

31:36.760 --> 31:41.320
<i>There are over a thousand souls
aboard the Stromos.</i>

31:41.400 --> 31:45.320
If Pharrin had attempted to revive the
others, then many more may have died.

31:45.400 --> 31:49.520
- Even one person to share the burden.
- Pharrin walked as far as he could see.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.760
There was little more than rock.

31:51.840 --> 31:57.160
Neither was there sufficient water or food
remaining aboard after the crash.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.440
Pharrin dare not revive another soul.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.240
We are not alone.

32:05.320 --> 32:08.880
We live in a democracy of one.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.080
It is strange, yes,

32:12.160 --> 32:16.200
but we are the chosen survivors
of an entire race.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.160
How could Pharrin have allowed
even one of us to be lost?

32:19.240 --> 32:21.960
Still, we could have helped you.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.960
There was... no time.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.360
We should have asked them.
No, we could not take the chance.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.320
You...

32:31.400 --> 32:34.400
would never have consented...

32:35.440 --> 32:38.000
would you?

32:38.080 --> 32:39.480
We would not.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.760
Then...

32:41.840 --> 32:44.040
we chose correctly.

32:44.960 --> 32:48.840
<i>Our mistake was to flee when you
revived so quickly from our stun weapon</i>

32:48.920 --> 32:51.000
<i>and returned for your friends.</i>

32:51.080 --> 32:54.320
<i>But too many of us were afraid.</i>

32:55.440 --> 32:57.960
<i>(Carter) There are other ways
we can help.</i>

32:58.040 --> 32:58.880
How?

32:58.960 --> 33:02.080
We could provide you with
an alternate power source,

33:02.160 --> 33:06.920
to bring your energy reserves up to where
they need to be to revive your people.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.840
It's possible I can retrieve it
and have it running within a few hours.

33:10.920 --> 33:14.920
There is no other way. Listen to her!
No. We must wait. The ships will come.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.600
We can take you anywhere you want
to go - another world, like Ardena.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.120
You have a ship?

33:22.200 --> 33:27.920
There's a device capable of transporting
your people instantaneously to any world.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.320
We call it a Stargate.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.760
- Such a device is not possible.
- Come with us and I'll prove it to you.

33:34.840 --> 33:39.600
However, we will only consent to do so
if you return our friend to his former state.

33:39.680 --> 33:43.480
- He is preserving life.
- At the expense of his own, unwillingly.

33:43.560 --> 33:47.280
Please... do not ask us to do this.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.320
We're not asking.

33:50.120 --> 33:54.360
The souls that your friend carries within
him are amongst the most precious of all.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.240
Our friend is equally as important to us.

33:57.320 --> 34:01.960
There will be nowhere for them to go.
They will be lost.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.440
But it is possible to undo this?

34:07.760 --> 34:10.400
How can I abandon them so easily?

34:10.480 --> 34:14.239
We have sworn to protect the sovereign.
But we may save hundreds of others.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.960
Pharrin!

34:26.320 --> 34:28.520
There is a way.

34:30.400 --> 34:34.280
Do you understand that what we're
offering could save everyone on this ship?

34:34.360 --> 34:40.760
And do you understand that one of the
souls that your friend carries within him...

34:43.120 --> 34:45.040
is my son?

34:54.400 --> 34:57.040
Please! Why does it hurt so much?

35:00.320 --> 35:04.320
All right.
Prepare 100 micrograms of fentanyl.

35:09.120 --> 35:14.960
That won't be necessary. I seem to have a
higher threshold for pain than the others.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.520
- Tryan?
- Yes.

35:17.600 --> 35:20.080
Oh, thank God for that.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.960
Janet?

35:23.040 --> 35:26.400
- Can I have a word?
- I'll be back.

35:39.120 --> 35:44.320
- Are you sure you trust this guy?
- He has much to gain by assisting us.

35:51.080 --> 35:54.840
Officer Pharrin, sir.
Engineer Tryan, second rank.

35:57.400 --> 36:03.840
Tryan. Of course. Of all of our crew, you
would have thought this was not possible.

36:03.920 --> 36:08.280
Of all our crew, sir, you're the one who'd
find a way to do it. How did you manage?

36:08.360 --> 36:13.200
Our training, and a shared will to survive.

36:13.280 --> 36:18.800
It is a strange way of living with others,
but it is better than the alternative.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.200
What of our ship and her passengers, sir?

36:30.160 --> 36:32.920
Our ship crash-landed.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.360
We failed to reach Ardena.

36:35.440 --> 36:40.840
Her passengers may yet be saved,
but not without considerable sacrifice

36:40.920 --> 36:45.840
<i>to you and to the others of the Stromos
that reside within you.</i>

36:48.160 --> 36:50.840
I understand, sir.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.840
These people possess a device

36:53.920 --> 36:59.440
capable of transporting
all our people to another world.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.120
Perhaps even Ardena.

37:02.200 --> 37:06.320
It is very real, and it will save our people.

37:08.320 --> 37:14.200
But in exchange, they ask that their friend
be returned to them as he was before.

37:15.480 --> 37:19.600
I believe it can be done if we act quickly.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.440
It is a reasonable bargain.

37:22.520 --> 37:27.560
I will do whatever is necessary, sir.
Whatever you ask of me.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.880
No! There will be no sacrifice of any kind.

37:33.960 --> 37:38.320
As your sovereign, I demand
you return me to the ship immediately.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.360
- Forgive me, Sovereign.
- Pharrin.

37:41.440 --> 37:45.400
We have sworn an oath to do his will.
We cannot proceed.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.320
Officer Pharrin...

37:50.320 --> 37:54.320
I have given you a command.
Do you understand me?

37:55.480 --> 37:57.960
Oh, for crying out loud.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.440
- Get up.
- I swore to protect the sovereign.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.520
- He's dead.
- His soul lives.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.560
- Not if I cut him out.
- You would not.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.800
Oh, yes, I would.

38:10.880 --> 38:13.640
- Pharrin, you will listen to me.
- Don't listen.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.840
Just do what you came here to do.

38:23.400 --> 38:27.760
Forgive us, Sovereign.
It is the only way to protect our people.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.160
I will not surrender this body,
not at any cost. It is mine.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.800
It was never ours.
If you save anyone, you will save me.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.840
The people of Talthus will die.
Let them!

38:35.920 --> 38:37.800
- Forgive me.
- How dare you touch me?

38:37.880 --> 38:42.600
For 12 years we fought to save the people
of Talthus. We will do anything to do so,

38:42.680 --> 38:45.880
no matter how great the sacrifice.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.640
Father?

38:58.840 --> 39:00.640
Keenin.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.800
I am so sorry, my son.

39:06.400 --> 39:11.680
You must sacrifice as well,
and we will be together.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.560
Do you understand?

39:17.160 --> 39:22.720
The people of Talthus will be safe
and they will remember us forever.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.160
But we'll be together.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.560
We'll be together.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.280
Well?

39:50.360 --> 39:54.560
I can't tell yet if they made it into Pharrin,
but Daniel's readings are back to normal.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.920
- How did you do that?
- It wasn't me, sir. It was Daniel.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.720
His mind protected itself. He never
emerged for more than a few seconds.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.520
That's what let Pharrin separate the others
from Daniel and absorb them.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.040
The more the merrier, I guess.

40:08.120 --> 40:12.680
He'll stay in suspended animation until the
other passengers can take care of him.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.520
You mean them.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.320
The naqahdah generator
will sustain the power.

40:24.400 --> 40:27.000
We can begin
the restoration process within hours.

40:27.080 --> 40:30.000
- We can relocate them shortly after that.
- Good.

40:30.080 --> 40:34.440
We'll leave that for SG-4.
They love that kind of stuff.

40:34.520 --> 40:37.800
- How's Daniel?
- He'll be unconscious for a while.

40:37.880 --> 40:40.240
- It's best if...
- What?

40:49.160 --> 40:50.960
Daniel?

40:51.840 --> 40:53.440
That you?

40:53.520 --> 40:54.920
Jack?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.680
- How you doing?
- Bad headache.

40:57.760 --> 41:02.880
- Nail-in-the-head kinda thing?
- Yeah. Something like that.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.800
Yeah.
