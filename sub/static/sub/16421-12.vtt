00:01.501 --> 00:03.253
Mr. Finn, you can't give me detention!

00:03.503 --> 00:05.171
Principal Mullins caught you on the roof,

00:05.255 --> 00:07.424
throwing water balloons
at unsuspecting children!

00:07.507 --> 00:11.928
And while that's hilarious, as a teacher,
I have no choice.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.597
But we were both throwing water balloons
off the roof!

00:14.681 --> 00:17.767
That's why I had no choice
but to blame it on you.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.439

You're wearing your mom's car?

00:28.153 --> 00:30.780
No, it's my new invention for laser tag.

00:30.864 --> 00:35.785
It's called "stealth armour."

The Austin Music Fest is coming up,

01:31.382 --> 01:33.593
and it's our best chance
to get our stuff to Mick Bronson!

01:33.927 --> 01:37.889
That's right, if we have the right song
to give him, it could be our big break!

01:38.097 --> 01:41.726
No pressure, guys, but it better be
the greatest thing you've ever written.

Okay, your first day of detention,
have you learned your lesson?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.607
Yeah, when your teacher says

02:29.691 --> 02:33.945
"hey, dude, you wanna go drop water
balloons off the roof with me," say no.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.533
Mmm, I didn't say "dude." I said "brah."

02:40.285 --> 02:43.163

on the ground?

02:43.621 --> 02:46.249

This has your name on it!

-Did you do it, Freddy?
-Me, no!

03:05.685 --> 03:08.187
Well, I'm just saying, you've kind
of got a bad reputation lately,

03:08.271 --> 03:09.564

03:10.064 --> 03:11.900
That was your idea!

Alright, it's time to get hardcore.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.490
I know exactly what to do.

Leave them a sternly worded note?

No! You're hurting my feelings!

12:51.270 --> 12:52.938
I just want things to go back
to the way they were

12:53.022 --> 12:54.899
before Tomika was chasing after me.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.651
Just in case, I brought this.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.778
-What's that?
-Skunk juice.

12:59.987 --> 13:03.324
One spray, and I'll smell so disgusting,
no one will ever come near me.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.493
But I only want to use it
as a last resort.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.953
I think you should just pretend
the kiss never happened.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.663
-Do you think that will work?
-I dunno.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.505
-Why-- why'd you do that?!
-Do what?

13:18.297 --> 13:22.259
-You just spit lemonade all over my face!
-No, I didn't.

13:22.801 --> 13:27.640
-You totally-- oh! I get it.
-Get what?

13:28.724 --> 13:32.770
That could work, plus, I got her
some chocolate milk as a peace offering.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.189
Look, there's only one way to solve this.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.442
Kiss all your friends,
that way you're on an even playing field.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.569
I'm ready.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.115
Hold it for five seconds,
or it doesn't count.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.577
I'm not going to kiss you.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.038
Now whose feelings are hurt?

13:53.916 --> 13:55.042
Uh, what's going on?

13:55.209 --> 13:57.920
Well, we were supposed
to have this Extreme Mozart Festival,

13:58.003 --> 14:01.173
but Gary, the janitor, has the only key
to the auditorium, and he's out sick.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.594
Hmm, well, if it's helpful,
I know a guy a who can get into any lock.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.556
-A locksmith?
-Not professionally.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.395
Mind-- mind if I join you?

14:14.687 --> 14:15.854
Why would I mind?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.110
What's that?

14:22.027 --> 14:24.697
Oh, this? This is just my new head gear.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.533
My orthodontist said I only have
to wear it during school,

14:27.700 --> 14:31.078
and after school songwriting,
and certain lunches.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.249
Oops, what was that?

14:35.457 --> 14:38.085
-My term paper on Shakespeare.
-Oh.

14:42.464 --> 14:46.468
My back really hurts, or I'd pick it up,
heh-heh, you gonna pick it up?

14:47.177 --> 14:49.054
Nah, I'll just write another one.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.685
Look, I just want to say that

14:54.768 --> 14:59.648
I'm glad we're friends.
Just very special friends.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.734
And I got you a little something
to show you how much

15:01.817 --> 15:03.527
I like being your friend.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.739
No, no need for gifts, really!

15:06.822 --> 15:08.532
I just want to get back
to the songwriting!

15:08.616 --> 15:09.783
Me too!

15:09.867 --> 15:12.828
I think this thing you and I are doing
is making something magical happen.

15:13.245 --> 15:17.833
No, no, no, no magic!
Ah, I have no choice!

15:18.208 --> 15:19.418
Breath spray?!

15:20.044 --> 15:22.338
[Screaming]

15:24.131 --> 15:25.215
Skunk mouth!

15:30.596 --> 15:32.681
We're pinned down, we're never going
to get out of here!

15:32.973 --> 15:34.850
We're gonna lose the tournament for sure!

15:34.934 --> 15:36.936
When I first started blasting people
with lasers,

15:37.019 --> 15:39.021
I never knew I'd be blasting my heart.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.566
I'm so bummed,
I can't even eat this pretzel.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.569
-Look, I'd be happy to--
-Back off, Billiam!

15:46.570 --> 15:48.614
I'm sorry, guys, I let you down.

15:48.697 --> 15:52.618
You don't have to be the Lawrencians,
we can be the Photon Rebels.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.454
It doesn't matter what we're called,
only the winners get their names

15:55.537 --> 15:57.706
on the scoreboard, and we're toast.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.376
[boy] Move in, guys, let's finish them!

16:00.668 --> 16:02.920
It's been an honour serving
along side you.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.214
We feel the same way.

16:06.966 --> 16:11.095
[music playing]

16:11.637 --> 16:15.099
[laser noises]

16:19.144 --> 16:20.771
So, what's the plan, guys?

16:22.523 --> 16:24.191
Summer, what are you doing here?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.652
Turns out, I'm not a lone wolf after all.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.195
Maybe we can win!

16:28.988 --> 16:30.280
What changed your mind?

16:30.364 --> 16:32.992
[Summer] You did, I don't want to win
if it means hurting you.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.535
Thanks, friend.

16:36.954 --> 16:42.209
[music playing]

16:42.292 --> 16:43.961
[laser noises]

16:46.463 --> 16:48.132
[lasers firing]

16:51.176 --> 16:54.179
Summer, you crazy kid! What did you do?!

16:54.513 --> 16:56.557
I did it for you.

16:56.890 --> 17:00.644
[gasping] I'm so c--cold...

17:00.936 --> 17:03.230
Lawrence, you should have told me
to bring a sweater.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.358
I should have done a lot of things.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.820
I think this is it for me.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.155
[laser powering up]

17:11.613 --> 17:12.698
Oh, I'm back!

17:15.868 --> 17:17.953
Let's go, Photon Rebels!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.706
-Not Photon Rebels.
-We took another vote.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.708
Lawrencians!

17:25.461 --> 17:26.462
[knocking]

17:27.212 --> 17:29.339
Mr. Finn, can I talk to you?

17:29.423 --> 17:32.051
Sorry, Tomika,
this is detention time only.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.219
I could break a window and come back.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.639
Ah, just sit down. You can't get
in trouble when you're with me.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.807
Seriously?!

17:42.061 --> 17:46.482
I don't know how to say this,
but I think Zack might be in love with me.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.443
Really?!
You're probably just imagining that.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.279
He started writing me love lyrics,
and then he bought me gifts,

17:52.362 --> 17:53.363
and then he kissed me!

17:53.447 --> 17:57.659
Yup, that's love, alright.
Congratulations!

17:58.243 --> 18:00.537
No, ugh!

18:00.871 --> 18:04.666
I don't want him to love me,
I just want us to be friends, like before!

18:04.750 --> 18:05.834
Then just tell him!

18:06.210 --> 18:09.004
Look, I know it's hard,
but until you're truly honest,

18:09.088 --> 18:10.881
you'll never get the results you want.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.509
But what if he stops being
my friend completely?

18:13.717 --> 18:15.052
You've gotta take a chance.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.555
Look at me,
people were stealing my goat yogurt,

18:18.639 --> 18:22.392
-and I wrote them a very honest note.
-And?

18:22.643 --> 18:26.772
Someone corrected the spelling,
but still, I got my yogurt.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.065
Mr. Finn, wait!

18:31.360 --> 18:33.654
Don't open that.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.491
Maybe next time,
lead with "don't open that."

18:48.460 --> 18:49.503
Zack!

18:54.466 --> 18:55.843
[clanking]

18:57.136 --> 18:58.220
[clanking]

18:59.263 --> 19:00.389
Zack!

19:03.851 --> 19:04.977
[glass breaking]

19:06.145 --> 19:08.939
What candle through yonder window breaks?

19:12.192 --> 19:13.193
Tomika?!

19:13.402 --> 19:14.653
Zack!

19:15.571 --> 19:17.489
I have to tell you what's in my heart.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.702
Oh man, don't make this weird.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.288
I don't love you!

19:24.371 --> 19:26.290
I'm not worthy of your-- what?

19:27.666 --> 19:30.085
-I don't love you!
-Really?!

19:30.794 --> 19:34.882
-Yes, I'm sorry, but--
-I don't love you, either!

19:35.299 --> 19:36.341
You're just saying that.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.803
No, seriously,
I don't have any feelings for you, at all.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.265
-But you kissed me?
-No, you kissed me!

19:43.348 --> 19:45.767
-I was just bending down!
-Me too!

19:46.185 --> 19:50.063
-So, we really don't love each other!
-Not at all!

19:51.356 --> 19:53.442
You've made me the happiest girl
in the world!

19:53.525 --> 19:54.985
I'm walking on air!

19:55.652 --> 19:58.697
-This means we can be friends again!
-And finish the song!

19:59.239 --> 20:00.866
Well, you'd better get out of here.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.160
That window you broke activated
the silent alarm.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.328
Oh.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.539
[Zack] You know, you were my first kiss.

20:08.498 --> 20:12.044
-You were mine, too.
-That's kinda nice.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.005
Yeah, we'll have that forever.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.506
If it had to be a friend,

20:16.590 --> 20:18.217
I'm glad it was you
and not Freddy or Lawrence.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.803
[laughing] Goodnight, goodnight.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.805
