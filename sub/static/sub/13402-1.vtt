I killed Charlotte."

I didn't wanna think
that's what happened.

00:08.740 --> 00:10.230
There's gonna be a lock
on that box tomorrow.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.764
But it's not what it looks like.
I promise you.

who has time to hear them.

Mary Drake is a patient here.

Your mom and Wilden are dead.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.659

00:36.670 --> 00:39.366
You're the only man
my daughter ever loved.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.099
I would have done
anything for Charlotte.

- Han!

- There is no other way, Emily.

It was a well thought-out plan
and when it ends up like this

01:17.470 --> 01:19.700
it's called first-degree murder.

you won't tell what I said

Hanna's life is on the line.

When you asked me for my help,
I said I was all in. I still am.

Alright, we're wasting time.
Let's go.

Alison's not the only one
seeing ghosts tonight.

ghosts at all.

a little bit dead

she was rotting-corpse dead.

she knows where Hanna is'

02:27.540 --> 02:29.531

just walk in there

02:30.780 --> 02:32.077

Hi. Officer Cavanaugh.

02:52.230 --> 02:54.221
How can I help you?

02:54.240 --> 02:56.265
I'm the new owner
of the Lost Woods Resort

02:56.270 --> 02:59.068
and I need to report
a break-in.

02:59.070 --> 03:01.607
Hmm. I have to ask.

You're a dead ringer for a woman
who used to live here.

03:05.510 --> 03:07.808
Jessica was my sister.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.778

She's Jessica's twin,
Mary Drake.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.246
From the Radley file.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.353
She's Charlotte's
biological mom.

standing here?

03:18.030 --> 03:19.258

her daughter.‘

ahead of us.

she had the motive

07:12.330 --> 07:14.821

to murder Charlotte.

07:14.830 --> 07:17.958

Charlotte wasn't wearing

Alison's car home.

who murdered Charlotte

08:18.260 --> 08:19.557
was wearing the red jacket

08:19.560 --> 08:21.425
it'll have Charlotte's blood

10:38.630 --> 10:41.098
But I'm afraid it's not enough
to help Alison.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.898
Ali thought
she was seeing dead people.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.559
This is clear proof
that she wasn't.

10:45.570 --> 10:48.403
Emily, since the last time
you saw her

10:48.410 --> 10:50.275
my wife's condition has..

10:51.550 --> 10:53.040
...rapidly declined.

10:53.050 --> 10:55.678
I'm afraid she suffered
a complete psychotic break.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.985
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I.

10:58.990 --> 11:02.153
But she is consumed with shame

11:02.160 --> 11:04.958
I believe,
prompted by a tragic event

11:04.960 --> 11:07.326
that-that she feels
responsible for.

11:11.900 --> 11:16.291
that would prompt her to have
such a, a lethal dose of guilt?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.131
- 'No!‘
- 'Doctor, it's a Code White.‘

11:18.140 --> 11:21.928
. (Alison)
No!No!NoP

11:21.940 --> 11:23.407
No! No!

11:23.410 --> 11:25.173
Get away from me!

11:25.180 --> 11:27.603
No! No!

11:27.620 --> 11:29.110
No!

11:30.520 --> 11:32.181
[panting]

11:48.940 --> 11:52.137
- Books.
- And more books.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.429
These are all written
In German.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.338
I think most of these
are French textbooks.

11:58.350 --> 12:01.205
Medicine, banking,
construction.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.439
’Fortgeschrittene Konzepte
In Der Chem/e. ”

12:04.450 --> 12:07.385
Advanced concepts in chemistry.

12:07.390 --> 12:08.789
You speak German?

12:08.790 --> 12:11.281
I'm sort of obsessed
with this language app

12:11.290 --> 12:12.780
where they reward you
with a flag

12:12.790 --> 12:14.348
every time you reach
the fluent level.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.419
Then your little emoji
boards a plane

12:16.430 --> 12:17.727
and it flies to the country.

12:17.730 --> 12:20.028
Sort of obsessed?
How many flags do you have?

12:20.040 --> 12:23.692
Um, French, Italian, German

12:23.710 --> 12:26.167
and this close
to flying to China.

12:28.410 --> 12:30.002
"The Art Of Cyber War."

12:30.010 --> 12:32.205
’54pp/iquer Principe
Et Prouve. ”

12:32.210 --> 12:34.144
Applied and proven principles.

12:34.150 --> 12:37.278
If Mary Drake is A.D.,
she's a self-taught "uber A."

12:37.290 --> 12:40.339
And she's been to more__countries
than your em0jl.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.285
Mostly Europe. But she's been
to Latin America too.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.888
Oh, hey, look at this.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.027
She flew from Heathrow
to Philly a month ago.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.888
That was right before
Charlotte died.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.162
About a week.

12:55.170 --> 12:56.398
So she's had plenty of time

12:56.400 --> 12:57.867
to become A.D.

13:14.220 --> 13:15.448
Okay.

13:25.770 --> 13:27.567
- We're good.
- Okay.

13:29.540 --> 13:30.859
Linen closet.

13:32.870 --> 13:34.167
I'll check the dresser.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.119
That's, that's a little weird.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.747
Oh, please don't tell me
that you found a toy.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.217
It's already bad enough
that I'm going

13:45.220 --> 13:46.881
through Alison's panty drawer.
I don't need to--

13:46.890 --> 13:48.858
It's locked.

13:55.730 --> 13:58.096
[sighs]
It's not here.

14:01.740 --> 14:02.832
I can't find a key anywhere.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.967
[door opens]

14:04.970 --> 14:07.200
[whispers]
Did you hear that?

14:10.480 --> 14:13.347
(man on TV)
'And in a related story,
the prime minister told BNS'

14:13.350 --> 14:16.239
'in an exclusive interview
that we need a proper'

14:16.250 --> 14:18.616
'government inquiry
into all of this.‘

14:18.620 --> 14:21.817
'In fact, the last government
ended scandals like this'

14:21.820 --> 14:23.959
'the current government is in..'

15:11.170 --> 15:13.365
[indistinct chatter on TV]

15:55.920 --> 15:57.774
[phone rings]

15:57.790 --> 15:59.382
- 'Hey.‘
- Hey.

15:59.390 --> 16:02.109
Uh, I just realized none of us
have had anything to eat

16:02.120 --> 16:04.657
since yesterday.
Can I bring you guys something?

16:04.660 --> 16:06.389
Food's the last thing
on my mind, Spencer.

16:06.390 --> 16:07.550
Okay, um, well

16:07.560 --> 16:09.824
then I'm gonna go over
the Mary Drake file again.

16:09.830 --> 16:12.697
- Maybe there's something--
- Alright, great-

16:14.740 --> 16:16.093
Bye to you too.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.598
I've got everything
that we need.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.804
Who's she talkin' to?

16:26.820 --> 16:28.242
I can only hear
her side of the call.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.911
I need just a few
more seconds to..

16:29.920 --> 16:31.717
No. No, no, no,
no, no. No, no.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.642
Don't hang up. Don't..

16:39.890 --> 16:44.224
Bleach, charcoal...vinegar.

16:44.230 --> 16:47.028
That's everything you need
to cover up a murder.

16:48.570 --> 16:51.630
- What's the charcoal for?
- Absorbs the smell of death.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.461
- Hey, she's still alive.
- How can you be so sure?

16:54.480 --> 16:57.176
Because they aren't gonna use
that tarp after the fact.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.775
And she's gonna lead us
to Hanna.

16:59.780 --> 17:03.238
Yeah, because she's on her way
to kill her.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.623
[gasping]

17:19.630 --> 17:21.769
Please stop. Stop!

17:21.770 --> 17:24.091
Please.

17:25.940 --> 17:27.100
Please stop.

17:27.110 --> 17:29.305
[panting]

17:35.150 --> 17:38.369
No. No. No.
Please stop. Please!

17:38.390 --> 17:40.881
[screams]
Stop!

17:40.890 --> 17:42.255
[groans]
Stop!

17:45.130 --> 17:47.781
She's been driving around
for hours.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.018
(Mona)
'She's either taking a tour
of the county'

17:50.030 --> 17:51.497
or she's completely lost.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.967
Or she knows
that we're following her

17:52.970 --> 17:55.325
and she's just
jerking us around.

17:56.770 --> 17:59.307
- 'She's turning left.‘
- She's not leading us to Hanna.

17:59.310 --> 18:01.528
She-she's taking us
to Alison's house.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.677
Cut the lights.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.340
(Mona)
Wait, she's going to Spencer's.

18:18.690 --> 18:20.385
[keypad beeping]

18:25.900 --> 18:27.595
[knock on door]

18:35.880 --> 18:37.700
[cell phone chimes]

18:37.710 --> 18:39.871
[knock on door]

18:45.390 --> 18:48.211
Are you Spencer or Melissa?

18:48.220 --> 18:50.882
Um, I know you must be
Jessica's sister.

18:50.890 --> 18:52.687
But have we met?

18:52.690 --> 18:56.023
A long time ago,
but you wouldn't remember.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.918
I'm Spencer.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.069
Are your parents home?

19:00.070 --> 19:02.288
No, they're on a cruise.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.360
- I'll check back another time.
- So you know each other?

19:06.470 --> 19:09.234
We used to have
a lot In common.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.128
Would you like to come inside?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.503
I could make us some tea.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.808
Yes. Yes, I would.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.652
Herbal or leaded.

19:25.660 --> 19:28.424
Oh, I've never been one
to turn down caffeine.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.388
Elliot's not here.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.662
But the nurse says
she's calmed down

19:34.670 --> 19:36.888
and I can see her
for a few minutes.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.389
(Aria)
'Well, I hope
she tells you the truth'

19:38.410 --> 19:39.832
'because we're running
out of time.‘

19:43.680 --> 19:47.207
I'm allowed to go in now.
I'll call you back.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.559
Ali?

20:01.330 --> 20:02.797
'Are you awake?‘

20:10.910 --> 20:13.799
Ali, please wake up.

20:16.110 --> 20:18.101
Hanna's in trouble.

20:18.110 --> 20:20.601
Okay? And I need to know
the truth.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.516
The truth about Charlotte.

20:34.930 --> 20:37.319
Did you do it?

20:43.770 --> 20:44.964
Did you..

20:46.140 --> 20:47.960
Did you kill her?

20:47.980 --> 20:49.777
[gasps]

20:50.480 --> 20:52.505
[heavy breathing]

20:52.510 --> 20:54.899
Oh, God, help me.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.842
Oh, please, God, forgive me.

21:06.490 --> 21:09.152
(Mary)
You and your sister
look so much alike.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.025
Almost like twins.

21:11.030 --> 21:14.329
Yeah, people thought that a lot
when we were younger.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.760
- Are you close?
- Occasionally.

21:19.210 --> 21:22.373
So when did you see
my parents last?

21:23.680 --> 21:26.308
I only asked because they never
talked about you.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.011
I know enough about your family

21:29.020 --> 21:33.343
to know that they're
excellent secret keepers.

21:33.350 --> 21:36.456
Well, why would
they keep you a secret?

21:37.290 --> 21:39.758
You certainly are inquisitive.

21:41.730 --> 21:43.789
I was just making conversation.

21:45.430 --> 21:49.992
I'm sorry. Forgive me
if I'm overly sensitive.

21:51.710 --> 21:54.668
The truth is, my sister and I
didn't get along.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.704
I moved away because she..

21:57.710 --> 21:59.541
...turned everyone
against me.

21:59.550 --> 22:02.474
My friends, my family.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.619
She poisoned them all
against me.

22:10.390 --> 22:14.429
I was born first,
and she was born jealous.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.028
Well, may I ask
why you've come back?

22:19.030 --> 22:20.964
I mean, why now?

22:20.970 --> 22:23.495
Because I found out
she was dead.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.468
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.404
- Thank you for the tea.
- Yeah.

22:31.410 --> 22:35.346
Um, so you're at the Lost Woods
all by yourself?

22:35.350 --> 22:37.978
Yes, I'm all alone.

22:37.990 --> 22:41.812
- Do you have any children?
- Like I said, it's just me.

22:43.660 --> 22:45.958
How would you know that
that's where I'm staying?

22:47.260 --> 22:49.524
Oh, it's such a small town.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.895
My ex-boyfriend is a cop

22:50.900 --> 22:53.061
and he told me
about your break-in.

22:54.440 --> 22:58.228
You know, you're a very luclq
young woman.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.539
I can't seem to be friends
with any of my ex-lovers.

23:02.910 --> 23:06.573
C’estZ/a Vie.
C’est la Vie.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.668
You should lock this door.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.819
These days,
you're not safe anywhere.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.089
She looks so scared.

23:32.810 --> 23:35.665
It's been over 36 hours
since you got any sleep.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.671
Maybe you should try and rest.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.713
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.416
I'll get a T-shirt,
and I'll set the alarm.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.585
Maybe I should go home.

23:52.130 --> 23:54.485
Are you sure?

23:54.500 --> 23:58.129
No, I mean, I'm not really
sure of anything.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.962
You know, I haven't talked
to Liam in days.

24:01.970 --> 24:03.858
You and I,
we haven't even talked

24:03.870 --> 24:05.098
about what happened between us.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.668
Was it a slip

24:06.670 --> 24:09.104
or are we friends
with benefits?

24:09.110 --> 24:10.873
Are we even a we again?

24:10.880 --> 24:12.700
I guess we have a lot
to talk about.

24:12.710 --> 24:15.076
Yeah, I just, I, um, feel like

24:15.080 --> 24:17.742
I need to think about it
before I can talk about it.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.118
Okay.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.749
Em, hey.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.250
How did it go with Ali?

24:30.260 --> 24:33.468
Uh, turns out they wouldn't
let me in to see her.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.061
Do you still have that key
that I gave you?

24:37.070 --> 24:38.162
Ali's?

24:38.170 --> 24:40.707
Uh, yeah.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.803
Are you thinking
about going back there?

24:42.810 --> 24:45.699
- I'll come with you.
- Emily.

24:45.710 --> 24:48.838
Um, I'll give you a call
ifI go.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.749
Yeah, okay.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.622
You okay?

25:05.630 --> 25:07.188
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.589
Again with the lies.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.603
- I'm sorry.
- That was a joke.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.775
It's just..

25:18.780 --> 25:22.238
...someone that I care
very deeply for.

25:23.850 --> 25:27.638
And I'm starting to think that
she did a very bad thing.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.048
Now another friend
is paying the price for it.

25:35.260 --> 25:38.491
The B-bridge

25:38.500 --> 25:41.594
I walk to it

25:41.600 --> 25:44.592
If there's a crowd
waiting for me

25:44.610 --> 25:48.364
I'll break through it but

25:48.380 --> 25:49.938
I made some lemon bars
this morning.

25:49.940 --> 25:52.306
It'll go really good
with that cappuccino.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.742
Come on.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.658
- What is she doing?
- It's called pacing.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.650
You know, I can actually
appreciate your skillset

26:06.660 --> 26:07.957
but do you always
have to be such a smart-ass?

26:07.960 --> 26:10.793
Do you always have to be
so direct?

26:10.800 --> 26:11.994
I was giving you a compliment.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.695
Calling me names
isn't complimentary.

26:13.700 --> 26:14.997
Whatever.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.058
[sighs]

26:19.810 --> 26:22.461
You know, she's in there alone.
We can take her.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.074
And then what?
We waterboard her?

26:25.080 --> 26:27.275
'Look, A.D. said
we have 24 hours.‘

26:27.280 --> 26:29.009
We still have six of those left.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.938
Wait, her phone's ringing.

26:35.390 --> 26:37.858
