02:13.350 --> 02:17.187
There are no American
combat forces in Laos.

02:41.253 --> 02:46.258
We are concerned by the
North Vietnamese move into Laos.

03:04.193 --> 03:07.279
50000 North Vietnamese
are there at the present time.

04:17.016 --> 04:20.226
American participation in Laos is at

04:20.810 --> 04:23.397
the request
of the neutralist government

04:23.981 --> 04:28.986
which was set up in accordance
with the 1962 accords, agreed to

04:29.945 --> 04:31.864
by Hanoi, Peking, and the USSR.

04:32.448 --> 04:36.035
We have been providing
logistical support

04:36.618 --> 04:42.332
and some training
to avoid Laos falling

04:42.916 --> 04:45.586
under Communist domination.

04:46.170 --> 04:48.672
No American manpower in Laos

04:49.256 --> 04:52.676
is there on a combat basis.

05:10.569 --> 05:11.528
Come on!

05:46.146 --> 05:47.606
Gene, no!

05:48.315 --> 05:49.274
No chance.

05:49.858 --> 05:51.402
Get back! Stay back!

05:55.614 --> 05:56.740
Son of a bitch.

05:58.409 --> 05:59.243
Gene...

05:59.827 --> 06:02.663
To hell with the cargo!
Is he dead?

06:04.373 --> 06:07.835
Well, Rob, if he's not
he's very, very calm.

06:08.877 --> 06:10.546
Jesus, I'm sorry.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.297
Hey, Gene

06:15.259 --> 06:17.428
We're not here right now.

06:19.263 --> 06:21.223
I saw Nixon on TV.

06:21.807 --> 06:25.602
So we're not actually here

06:26.186 --> 06:27.688
and this didn't happen.

06:28.272 --> 06:31.608
Maybe not for you
and not for Nixon

06:33.402 --> 06:37.156
but it happened for Doug.
We sure go through pilots.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.617
Gene! Remember!

06:41.660 --> 06:42.661
Shhh!

06:43.245 --> 06:48.417
Since we're not here, I don't remember
what the fuck you didn't say.

06:49.001 --> 06:52.588
These pilots are head cases!
Yeah.

06:53.172 --> 06:56.216
And the worst part is
we need more of 'em.

07:41.470 --> 07:45.891
Now to our "eye in the sky"
pilot Billy Covington.

07:46.475 --> 07:47.893
How ya doing up there?

07:48.477 --> 07:51.730
I think the music speaks for me:

07:52.314 --> 07:54.274
"All I want is to be 'a free

07:54.858 --> 07:58.028
live my life the way I want 'a be."

07:58.612 --> 08:00.489
How's the traffic, Billy?

08:01.073 --> 08:03.784
Traffic's kinda depressing. Sad.

08:04.368 --> 08:07.079
Real congested.
Kinda bumsy looking

08:07.663 --> 08:11.250
to tell you.
We've heard there's

08:11.834 --> 08:13.502
a whale of a jam on the 103.

08:14.086 --> 08:17.506
Yeah. You know why?
That's why we

08:18.090 --> 08:21.051
go to you, Bill.
I'll tell you.

08:21.635 --> 08:25.055
'Cause most drivers turn into
pagan rubbernecks, hoping

08:25.639 --> 08:28.392
to see a fatality. Makes a
gawker's block

08:28.976 --> 08:31.437
for a coupla miles back.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.605
Not unlike this moron

08:34.188 --> 08:38.527
in the brown 18 wheeler from
Rubio moving and hauling.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.363
'Scuse me a sec, Stevie.

08:42.239 --> 08:44.700
Move your truck!
An ambulance is coming!

08:45.284 --> 08:47.578
Fuck you, "eye in the sky!"

08:48.162 --> 08:49.913
Fuck me?
Yeah! Fuck you!

08:50.497 --> 08:52.875
What'd you say?
I said fuck you!

08:53.459 --> 08:55.544
You want a convertible?
Get down here

08:56.128 --> 08:58.797
fucking punk. I'll kick your ass!

08:59.381 --> 09:00.507
You airborne piece of shit!

09:01.091 --> 09:07.139
This is Rock 1080, where else can you
get such in depth traffic reporting?

09:07.723 --> 09:10.476
You should be arrested!
This is very dangerous!

09:14.646 --> 09:18.233
I'll bust that whirlybird
to hell and back!

09:48.138 --> 09:49.682
License SUSPEN DED

09:58.357 --> 09:59.441
Hey, Billy.

10:00.025 --> 10:02.945
Who are you?
Heard about your fall from grace.

10:03.529 --> 10:06.490
An adventurer without an adventure.
Wrong.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.660
Nothing lower than a grounded pilot.
Who are you?

10:10.202 --> 10:14.748
I want to ask you why you flew
so low over that accident?

10:15.332 --> 10:17.418
The ambulance couldn't get through.

10:19.878 --> 10:23.757
I want to be down in the action.
Thought so.

10:24.341 --> 10:29.263
The thing that got you fired here
can get you hired in Laos.

10:29.847 --> 10:30.806
There's a war there!

10:31.390 --> 10:34.476
In Vietnam, not Laos.
You saw the President on TV?

10:35.060 --> 10:37.438
Heckle and Jeckle talk on TV
doesn't mean

10:38.022 --> 10:40.941
I believe birds can really talk.
Point taken.

10:41.525 --> 10:43.402
But there's no war in Laos.

10:43.986 --> 10:47.239
You can take that to the bank.
Who'll be signing my checks?

10:48.490 --> 10:51.535
Our outfit's called Air America.
Strictly civilian.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.288
American Pilots. Men like you.

10:54.872 --> 11:00.419
Wild men flying cargo and
refugees in the wild East.

11:01.503 --> 11:03.047
FAA took my ticket, man.

11:03.922 --> 11:05.924
Get you a new one in Taiwan.
No sweat.

11:07.593 --> 11:08.969
Who are you?

11:10.220 --> 11:12.431
Your biggest fan.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.868
What's it supposed to be?
Sound of the torment of war.

12:15.452 --> 12:18.372
When the enemy hears this
coming from your planes

12:18.956 --> 12:21.875
they'll flip. The North Vietnamese

12:22.459 --> 12:27.256
are pouring into Laos heading to
Saigon along the Ho Chi Minh trail

12:27.840 --> 12:29.967
hooking up with their Commie buddies.

12:30.551 --> 12:34.555
We blast 'em with this stuff
they panic, they scatter. I admit

12:35.139 --> 12:38.684
it's a dangerous mission.
Worse than dangerous.

12:39.268 --> 12:41.854
This is embarrassing, man!

12:42.438 --> 12:44.440
They'll point and laugh!

12:45.024 --> 12:46.692
This tape

12:47.276 --> 12:50.863
was made by experts for maximum
psychological effect.

12:51.613 --> 12:53.907
You've got no idea
who you're fighting here.

12:54.491 --> 12:57.703
You know more about it
than American Intelligence.

12:58.287 --> 13:04.376
Don't use the word "intelligence"
to describe your job.

13:07.546 --> 13:09.298
Rob Diehl? Hi.

13:09.882 --> 13:11.300
I'm Billy Covington.

13:11.884 --> 13:14.470
Welcome.
Thanks.

13:15.012 --> 13:18.891
You have some paperwork?
Nice bat.

13:19.475 --> 13:21.393
Billy is one of you guys.

13:23.354 --> 13:25.314
Thanks. So talk to 'em.

13:26.815 --> 13:29.777
Hi, guys.
What brings you here, Covington?

13:31.153 --> 13:33.238
I hear there's some good flying.

13:33.822 --> 13:34.740
Good flying?

13:35.991 --> 13:36.742
Yeah?

13:37.326 --> 13:39.203
Depends where you're coming from.

13:39.787 --> 13:41.830
Where are you coming from?

13:43.540 --> 13:47.127
From L.A. The west coast of the US.
Where are you coming from?

13:47.795 --> 13:49.963
From the dark side of the moon.

13:51.090 --> 13:54.051
And I'm going back there soon.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.514
The golden BB is coming.
My bat.

13:59.098 --> 14:00.891
Nomenclature: BB, gold.

14:01.475 --> 14:03.519
Ordinance: Personnel, Neely.

14:05.562 --> 14:07.356
And the four rounds you can't...

14:08.357 --> 14:10.651
Pilot hi jinks.
It's their way of coping.

14:11.235 --> 14:14.363
Pilot hi jinks?
This is psychotic behavior.

14:14.947 --> 14:19.535
Psychotic behavior is company policy
at Air America. I'm Gene Ryack.

14:20.369 --> 14:25.124
Take Billy on his orientation flight.
OK with me. Is it OK with you?

14:25.666 --> 14:29.044
Let's get in the wind.
Give him the bat.

14:30.045 --> 14:33.090
This is Long Tieng, right?
Right.

14:33.674 --> 14:37.094
There's nothing here on the map.

14:37.678 --> 14:41.557
Well I guess it's like Rob says.
We're not here.

14:42.141 --> 14:45.602
Which means you're not seeing
the second biggest city in Laos

14:46.186 --> 14:48.981
built from scratch
by the U. S. Government.

14:49.565 --> 14:53.402
And we really don't run 400 flights
or ship 100 tons of cargo

14:53.986 --> 14:57.281
medicine, weapons
or local troops, like those.

14:57.865 --> 15:01.910
"Anywhere, anything, any time."
That's our motto.

15:02.494 --> 15:06.957
We fly C 123, Helio Couriers
fairly normal machines.

15:07.541 --> 15:10.461
But the real fun is playing
with these freaky planes.

15:11.045 --> 15:14.882
These aren't legal in the US.
This ain't the States.

15:15.466 --> 15:16.508
Damn right.

15:18.969 --> 15:22.306
Watcha got today?
Peanut butter and mayo. What you got?

15:22.890 --> 15:24.933
Flight schedule.
About time

15:48.374 --> 15:50.292
You seem to be doing OK.

15:51.669 --> 15:55.005
I do all right in the air
I tend to fuck up on the ground.

15:55.589 --> 15:58.842
Mind if I look in your logbook?

16:01.261 --> 16:03.305
14 months of bush flying in Canada.

16:03.889 --> 16:06.350
Bush flying?
Yeah, bush flying.

16:07.559 --> 16:09.937
2 months crop dusting
outside of Fresno.

16:10.521 --> 16:12.690
Fresno. Youâ€™re a real fucking hero.

16:16.110 --> 16:20.447
You flew "eye in the sky"?
Excuse me, is that an Uzi?

16:21.031 --> 16:23.450
That'd make a great ad:

16:24.118 --> 16:26.328
"Excuse me, is that an Uzi?"
"Why yes

16:26.912 --> 16:31.583
self defense is no joke.
That's why I pack an Uzi.

16:32.167 --> 16:33.377
Accept no substitutes."

16:33.961 --> 16:35.629
Show him your amulet, Gene!

16:37.464 --> 16:38.298
What's in there?

16:38.882 --> 16:42.886
The ashes of my big toe. Shot off
through the floor of the cockpit.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.596
Not far from here.

16:45.180 --> 16:47.808
You get shot here?
It was ugly.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.310
He had it cremated.

16:50.894 --> 16:52.980
Always has it with him.
Wait a sec.

16:53.564 --> 16:57.693
No one told me about losing toes.
He never mentioned toe loss.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.112
Who
The recruiter.

17:00.988 --> 17:03.574
Why didn't you get it
sewn back on?

17:04.116 --> 17:07.869
When a piece of me gets shot off
I don't want it back.

17:08.454 --> 17:10.289
It's still with us in spirit.

17:10.873 --> 17:12.040
You understand?

17:12.624 --> 17:15.252
In spirit, toe ism.

17:29.725 --> 17:34.980
Royal Asian Airlines Flight No. 744.
Arriving at gate 12.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.442
Glad you could make it, sir.

17:41.653 --> 17:47.868
A US senator? In my back yard?
On a fact finding mission?

17:48.702 --> 17:51.914
He's not gonna find any facts.
I promise.

17:52.498 --> 17:57.044
Certainly not about our little deal.
Besides, he's a dimwit.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.881
He had a tractor dealership
before he got elected.

18:02.383 --> 18:07.513
Harry Truman sold cheap suits
he wound up dropping an atomic bomb.

18:27.074 --> 18:30.285
Welcome to Vientiane, sir.
Thank you, Ambassador Marloff.

18:30.869 --> 18:34.790
Senator, this is major Lemond.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

18:35.374 --> 18:39.128
Of course. Where's the uniform, Major?
Too hot for all those ribbons?

18:39.712 --> 18:43.966
You going civvie on us?
I'm a civilian now.

18:44.550 --> 18:46.677
With the Air Force at heart.

18:49.638 --> 18:52.808
Thank you. Put bag in big car.
Senator...

18:53.392 --> 18:54.435
I know.

18:55.019 --> 18:57.604
Sorry
have no local dinero.

18:58.188 --> 18:59.982
Give tip later OK?
Senator!

19:00.566 --> 19:04.611
This is General Lu Soong
Supreme Commander of the Allies.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.908
Hello?

19:10.534 --> 19:11.577
Anybody home?

19:12.619 --> 19:14.496
Get a load of Senator Tact here.

19:15.080 --> 19:19.001
When you go to France, you have
General DeGaulle carry luggage?

19:19.793 --> 19:20.919
Rob, the bag.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.967
I'll take that, sir. Your jacket?
Thank you.

19:34.767 --> 19:37.728
Lighten up on the stick.
We're gonna land.

19:38.604 --> 19:39.855
Land? Where?

19:40.439 --> 19:43.442
I'll show you.
Oh, come on.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.947
That's not a strip, it's a mountain.
Full flap, 3 cranks.

19:57.748 --> 19:58.957
Please don't do this.

20:10.386 --> 20:12.638
That was great. How was it for you?

20:37.121 --> 20:39.331
There're people in the jungle!

20:40.499 --> 20:42.001
Don't, I know them.

20:42.584 --> 20:43.627
Who are they?

20:44.211 --> 20:47.673
Friends of my wife.
Little one's my brother in law

20:48.257 --> 20:50.843
with a business proposition.
Don't do that.

21:12.614 --> 21:16.618
Six crates of weapons.
I'll make you a good offer.

21:19.496 --> 21:22.291
The Russians air dropped them
for the Pathet Lao.

21:24.126 --> 21:26.003
We stole 'em. Brand new.

21:31.842 --> 21:33.719
I'll give you 400 kips.

21:34.845 --> 21:39.099
400? You want a slingshot?
800 kips!

21:43.645 --> 21:45.647
600, and it's a deal.

21:51.028 --> 21:53.197
Brother in laws are the same all over.

21:53.781 --> 21:55.240
He's ripping me off...

21:55.824 --> 21:56.825
Deal!

22:13.467 --> 22:17.554
You use my orientation flight
for some private scam?

22:18.305 --> 22:19.848
Welcome to the orient.

22:21.350 --> 22:23.227
This is my retirement plan!

22:23.977 --> 22:29.233
I've been flying fifteen years and
want my chunk of the American dream.

22:31.110 --> 22:32.361
Running guns?

22:40.744 --> 22:42.705
OK, this is the hard part.

22:43.455 --> 22:45.582
I noticed, no radar.

22:46.166 --> 22:49.044
Right, just dead reckoning.

22:50.129 --> 22:51.755
I can handle it.

22:52.756 --> 22:53.632
Good.

23:06.437 --> 23:09.023
Gene, sit down. Check this out!

23:12.026 --> 23:13.235
Pretty good, huh?

23:36.550 --> 23:41.430
OK, we almost hit that at 3700
feet. Any higher peaks than that?

23:42.306 --> 23:46.769
At 3700 feet! Any higher
peaks around here?

23:47.353 --> 23:48.312
Yeah.

23:48.896 --> 23:51.023
I need green.
Don't use mine.

23:51.607 --> 23:54.443
We gotta get on a new
safety height, OK?

23:55.027 --> 23:58.113
Hey, I was going for that one!
You did that on purpose.

23:58.697 --> 24:02.743
Last time you colored the sky pink.
Are we south or east of

24:03.327 --> 24:04.495
the Atlantic here?

24:05.079 --> 24:06.580
South or east?

24:08.582 --> 24:12.378
South or east?
East! Don't bother me!

24:12.961 --> 24:14.963
Stay on your side!
It's my coloring book.

24:15.547 --> 24:18.926
If you want to color
you have to be nice to me.

24:35.818 --> 24:39.154
Hey, Senator
let us show you the real Laos!

24:41.990 --> 24:43.659
Sir, he's getting out.

24:44.243 --> 24:45.828
Senator, wait!

24:47.496 --> 24:50.332
Those pilots are drunk.
Not just drunk

24:50.916 --> 24:53.544
they're drunk Americans.
Hey, fellas!

24:55.045 --> 24:57.297
Pitchin' a little woo, are ya?

24:59.383 --> 25:03.220
Don't be embarrassed.
I may look like an old fart

25:03.804 --> 25:07.725
but before I found the lord, I partook
of wine, women, and song, too.

25:10.894 --> 25:16.066
But seriously, even though you won't
get any medals, or be in history books

25:17.109 --> 25:19.028
some of us in Washington know exactly

25:19.611 --> 25:21.488
what you're doing for the war effort.

25:22.406 --> 25:24.783
Could you explain it to us?

25:45.554 --> 25:47.931
It's just as heavy as Vietnam.
No!

25:48.515 --> 25:50.976
Never compare the two.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.439
Vietnam is for niggers and no necks.

25:56.023 --> 25:58.233
Sorry
it's the Mai Tai talking.

26:00.194 --> 26:04.198
This is a gentleman's war
a thinking man's war.

26:04.907 --> 26:05.908
Hello.

26:07.785 --> 26:10.412
Corinne Landreaux
this is Billy Covington.

26:10.996 --> 26:14.541
She helps our Asian brothers
in the hills. Thanks.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.044
Hey, I kid, because I care.

26:18.629 --> 26:21.715
You know what the whole problem
with the Vietnam war is?

26:24.426 --> 26:28.347
It's too public.
A secret war is the way to go.

26:28.931 --> 26:32.393
No reporters, no TV
You blackout the war

26:32.976 --> 26:36.772
like a football game.
And y'know what?

26:39.316 --> 26:40.776
We can't lose.

26:42.236 --> 26:44.071
Can I ask you one thing?

26:45.155 --> 26:49.159
Is it a kinky turn on for you
to bring her to a whorehouse with you?

26:50.661 --> 26:55.958
This is not just a whorehouse.
Men talk business here.

26:56.542 --> 26:58.836
I was just getting used to
this being a war.

27:00.671 --> 27:03.173
Who told you
they were two different things?

27:03.757 --> 27:05.467
Rob, I need you outside.

27:06.051 --> 27:08.137
And clear headed!

27:21.525 --> 27:22.693
Worried, Rob?

27:23.277 --> 27:27.781
I wonder what the Pepsi people
would think if they knew.

27:28.991 --> 27:31.702
Don't you ever wonder?
No.

27:32.286 --> 27:35.581
I wonder how many pilots
already know about his place.

27:40.836 --> 27:44.840
Heroin good, very good.
You want to try?

27:45.883 --> 27:49.303
With all due respect
I'm not here for a taste test.

27:49.887 --> 27:53.474
I'm here to ask you again

27:54.058 --> 27:57.353
to shut this lab down
just while the Senator is here.

27:57.936 --> 28:03.192
Why you not tell baggage man
Senator to go home? Kick out!

28:03.984 --> 28:06.570
I wish it were that simple.

28:07.112 --> 28:10.991
In a civilized country like yours
it would be.

28:11.575 --> 28:16.914
But in this case, it's easier
to shut down this lab.

28:17.498 --> 28:19.875
Then you and me be poor
and cannot pay for war.

28:20.459 --> 28:24.088
If we don't sell heroin
no money to feed my soldiers.

28:24.672 --> 28:27.925
No, Major.
Better we stay good friends.

28:29.301 --> 28:32.680
You take care of silly
suitcase man OK?

28:34.973 --> 28:36.600
Of course, General.

28:37.184 --> 28:41.397
As always, you are right.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.668
Something wrong?

29:03.585 --> 29:08.215
I was always the weirdest guy in the
room. Here I'm not in the running.

29:08.799 --> 29:11.427
You can be as weird as anyone here.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.430
It just takes a little time.

29:15.639 --> 29:18.142
I feel like I'm on
a roller coaster of bar girls

29:18.726 --> 29:21.437
strange squiggly signs
weird vehicles and

29:22.021 --> 29:23.522
more bar girls, and Mai Tais and

29:24.106 --> 29:28.610
what am I doing here?
I ask myself that all the time.

29:29.153 --> 29:33.073
Why am I here?
Why am I here?

29:35.701 --> 29:37.578
A taste of the States, feel better?

29:38.495 --> 29:41.290
Yeah, everything's back to normal now.
Good.

29:56.972 --> 29:58.223
Nice silencer.

29:58.807 --> 30:01.435
I am a very considerate person.

30:02.186 --> 30:06.565
If I want to shoot lizards at night
on my miniature golf course

30:07.232 --> 30:10.194
no reason to keep the neighbors awake.

30:10.778 --> 30:14.281
You follow me?
Yeah, at a distance.

30:19.119 --> 30:21.872
You're all right... fuckin' punk.

30:22.456 --> 30:27.461
Jack's the only man you ever met
with his own miniature golf course.

30:28.045 --> 30:32.508
Why don't you open this place up
and charge admission?

30:33.092 --> 30:34.968
You guys can do that when I'm gone.

30:35.594 --> 30:38.180
You guys get it in my will.
Oh, shit. Please!

30:39.014 --> 30:41.225
Jack's got a point:

30:41.809 --> 30:43.769
The old timers don't get a pension.

30:44.353 --> 30:47.648
Each pilot has to work out
his own retirement scam.

30:49.233 --> 30:52.945
Gino, how's your guns and ammo shop?
Building up inventory?

30:53.529 --> 30:57.950
You ever gonna sell?
Never make a move too soon.

30:58.534 --> 31:01.996
I got a foolproof plan.
I'll take my money...

31:02.579 --> 31:05.416
...and fly a Coppertone banner
over Coney Island

31:06.000 --> 31:10.045
and tell war stories in bars.

31:15.217 --> 31:20.180
"The golden BB's coming up
to Neely now..."

31:28.147 --> 31:29.606
Why you do that?

31:30.774 --> 31:32.026
Why the fuck?

31:41.285 --> 31:43.454
Hey, professionalism.

31:45.039 --> 31:47.249
How often do you guys
go on a bender like this?

31:47.833 --> 31:50.085
Bender?
This is just nighttime.

32:19.490 --> 32:20.574
O.V.!

32:21.158 --> 32:24.244
Wake Billy!
I gotta bring him to work.

32:29.708 --> 32:32.378
Wake up, junior! Wake up!

32:45.808 --> 32:49.144
It's OK. He likes to fly.

33:41.655 --> 33:42.823
Good morning!

33:57.880 --> 33:59.923
Crazy Americans!

35:06.490 --> 35:08.325
Gene.
Morning, Rob. Morning.

35:08.909 --> 35:12.955
Pick up Senator Davenport
at the Vientiane airport

35:13.539 --> 35:15.624
and take him up to the
refugee camp at Bien Luc.

35:16.208 --> 35:19.128
Lips zipped about this airbase.

35:19.712 --> 35:23.716
If he's dying for local action
just dazzle him with bullshit.

35:24.299 --> 35:27.720
We got nothing else
to dazzle him with.

35:28.303 --> 35:29.680
See ya!

35:32.641 --> 35:35.352
Gene!
Don't fuck around with the Senator.

35:35.936 --> 35:39.148
What do you mean?
He's on a need to know basis.

35:39.732 --> 35:43.777
The mushroom treatment: Keep him
in the dark and feed him on shit.

35:51.493 --> 35:53.620
What's he doing to your plane?

35:54.204 --> 35:56.623
He's purifying it.
It's a Buddhist ritual.

36:17.561 --> 36:20.564
Gene, is there
a secret air base around here?

36:21.148 --> 36:23.108
Which air base, sir?

36:26.195 --> 36:28.447
I feel I'm being
kept out of the loop.

36:29.031 --> 36:32.493
What do I know.
I'm just a luggage boy.

36:33.077 --> 36:36.288
General, stop pouting.
I apologized.

36:36.872 --> 36:39.041
I should be carrying your luggage.

36:39.625 --> 36:42.795
That's how much the US government
values your support.

36:45.464 --> 36:49.259
I hear that the USA finish war
and leave Southeast Asia.

36:49.843 --> 36:52.930
Without suitcase.
General

36:54.181 --> 36:57.810
if things get too hairy for us
politically, we have to bug out

36:58.394 --> 36:59.645
and bring you with us.

37:00.229 --> 37:03.148
We take care of our buddies.
You take care of shit!

37:03.732 --> 37:08.028
We've made general Ky in Vietnam
a very generous offer.

37:08.612 --> 37:12.074
I know Marshal Ky.
He's small time.

37:12.658 --> 37:15.494
After war he want to be in America
liquor store owner.

37:16.078 --> 37:19.915
I not going from being warlord
to liquor store owner!

37:22.793 --> 37:27.047
Tell the Senator
what you really want, General.

37:27.631 --> 37:29.717
Come on, don't be shy.

37:31.176 --> 37:33.804
Holiday Inn. Southern California.

37:34.388 --> 37:36.140
Owner and operator.

37:38.559 --> 37:40.853
That could be difficult.

37:42.187 --> 37:43.689
You find all this funny?

37:44.273 --> 37:47.026
Very. But, hell, Senator

37:47.609 --> 37:50.738
If you can't laugh at war
what's the use of fighting?

37:54.033 --> 37:56.452
You've got a good point!

38:25.314 --> 38:28.067
What's that tin horn general
doing in my camp?

38:28.650 --> 38:32.529
Corinne, this is Senator Davenport.
Welcome, Senator.

38:33.947 --> 38:38.202
Corinne Landreaux from US Aid.
May I show you around?

38:39.953 --> 38:43.499
Your boss picked a hell of a place
in the heart of opium country.

38:44.083 --> 38:47.127
My first choice was Kansas
but nothing was free.

38:47.711 --> 38:50.297
There's only
mountains and poppies here.

38:50.839 --> 38:55.636
You stay two, three weeks here?
At best, then we leave.

38:56.470 --> 38:58.972
This is noble work you do.

38:59.556 --> 39:04.061
Thank you, Senator.
I'll see you at the plane. Bye.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.150
Look at him operate!

39:11.110 --> 39:14.238
He's shanghaiing men and boys
for his private army.

39:14.822 --> 39:18.075
That's an ugly word.
What would you call it?

39:18.659 --> 39:21.495
I'd say he's showing charisma.
Charisma?

39:22.079 --> 39:26.000
These people have
different values than we do.

39:26.583 --> 39:30.379
But the nice part is we're all
pulling together for the same cause.

39:30.963 --> 39:32.548
The same cause?

39:33.132 --> 39:35.801
Soong's only cause is General Soong.
Don't you get it?

39:36.385 --> 39:41.140
The CIA flies drugs for him
so he loans us his troops.

39:41.724 --> 39:44.643
You know what?
You've been working your butt off

39:45.227 --> 39:49.440
under the hot sun
and God bless you for it.

39:50.232 --> 39:52.443
But you're starting to rave.

39:53.235 --> 39:55.237
I think you need a vacation.

39:59.491 --> 40:00.492
Have a nice day.

40:01.076 --> 40:02.911
Thanks for coming.

40:03.495 --> 40:07.624
You do me great honor
for come to Nino's, Excellency.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.127
Thank you, Nino.

40:14.631 --> 40:16.842
I'm concerned, gentlemen.

40:17.426 --> 40:19.762
We're not children in Congress.
General Song...

40:20.346 --> 40:24.975
Soong.
Is up to something with opium.

40:25.559 --> 40:28.520
Now, nobody's perfect
not even our allies.

40:30.689 --> 40:35.944
But seriously, when we hear rumors
of Americans taking drug money

40:36.528 --> 40:40.991
it endangers the entire war.
Now I want to know the truth.

40:42.743 --> 40:45.454
I'm afraid
we've been keeping the truth from you.

40:46.038 --> 40:50.709
We suspect that our planes
are being used to fly Opium

40:51.293 --> 40:53.003
from the highlands
to Vientiane

40:53.587 --> 40:55.756
where it is processed into heroin.
Dear God.

40:58.217 --> 41:00.594
Why wasn't I told before?

41:01.178 --> 41:03.681
We've made a grave mistake.

41:05.349 --> 41:08.060
We were trying to protect
the good name of our pilots, sir.

41:08.936 --> 41:10.688
You mean our pilots...

41:12.606 --> 41:14.566
...are smuggling narcotics?

41:15.150 --> 41:19.446
Not all of 'em, sir.
Just a few bad apples.

41:20.114 --> 41:22.491
They know we can't
inspect every piece of cargo.

41:23.075 --> 41:25.077
So they take advantage of our trust.

41:26.245 --> 41:28.831
Do you know who they are?
We'll find out.

41:29.498 --> 41:34.086
I pledge to you
we'll find those rotten apples.

42:24.845 --> 42:27.306
Hey, General.
What's the cargo?

42:27.890 --> 42:29.808
None of your business.

42:32.019 --> 42:33.562
Your cargo's loaded.

42:35.481 --> 42:37.733
Here's your co pilot.

42:39.193 --> 42:41.278
Enjoy the animals, fellas.

42:44.656 --> 42:45.532
What?

42:46.408 --> 42:48.619
I got a bad feeling this morning.

42:49.328 --> 42:52.456
Don't worry, we won't run into
any golden BB'S, OK?

42:53.040 --> 42:56.168
I'll be your good luck charm.
No bullets.

43:13.686 --> 43:16.563
Rice drop's first
then the 3 little pigs.

43:17.147 --> 43:19.400
There's no sign on the last one.

43:19.983 --> 43:22.569
General Soong
supervised the loading.

43:23.862 --> 43:25.155
So, what would that be?

43:28.534 --> 43:30.077
Come up to a 12 o'clock.

43:34.415 --> 43:36.500
First drop zone coming up!

43:39.169 --> 43:40.337
Stand by!

43:42.548 --> 43:43.716
Coming up on it.

43:46.593 --> 43:47.761
Looking good.

43:48.512 --> 43:49.513
Air speed's good.

43:51.682 --> 43:53.017
Altitude's good.

43:59.857 --> 44:00.566
Three.

44:01.483 --> 44:02.443
Two.

44:03.068 --> 44:04.278
One.

44:05.237 --> 44:05.863
Now!

44:14.788 --> 44:16.457
Kwan went out the back!
What?

44:17.041 --> 44:19.084
Has she got a chute?

44:19.668 --> 44:21.962
No.
What? We gotta go back!

44:22.546 --> 44:25.507
No. You never go back.
What do you mean?

44:26.091 --> 44:30.846
You just lost your kicker!
You never go back.

44:36.185 --> 44:38.062
Jesus Christ
you meet someone and they die.

44:40.105 --> 44:43.859
They should always wear chutes.

44:51.116 --> 44:52.159
Hey, come on!

44:54.662 --> 44:56.121
That's not funny! OK?

44:56.789 --> 44:58.624
That's not funny!

45:06.590 --> 45:08.550
Billy, how's it going?

45:09.968 --> 45:10.427
Great.

45:15.349 --> 45:17.559
Listen.
Nino's got lobster tonight

45:18.143 --> 45:21.522
but you gotta order in advance.
You up for some of that?

45:22.106 --> 45:25.234
Lobster again?
If I'm still alive I'd like some.

45:25.818 --> 45:27.945
Good, I'll radio in

45:28.529 --> 45:33.242
a reservation.
9 o'clock OK for you guys?

45:33.826 --> 45:36.495
Great
Rodger that.

45:38.288 --> 45:39.790
Hell of a war, man.

45:41.834 --> 45:44.545
340. 12 o'clock coming up.

45:45.129 --> 45:46.463
Stand by.

45:54.596 --> 45:55.681
Comin' up on it.

45:56.265 --> 45:57.307
Three. Two.

45:58.600 --> 45:59.560
One.

46:00.269 --> 46:01.061
Now!

46:23.417 --> 46:24.877
Shit!

46:26.670 --> 46:27.379
Quit it!

46:31.759 --> 46:32.760
Oh man.

46:33.886 --> 46:36.388
Who's shooting at us?
Here? Everybody.

46:40.976 --> 46:44.605
I'm not gonna die
dropping pigs from the sky.

46:45.773 --> 46:49.818
The golden BB.
I knew it.

46:50.444 --> 46:53.614
Just a question of when.
I knew you were coming.

46:54.198 --> 46:56.325
I saw it in the mirror this morning

46:56.909 --> 47:00.663
when I cut myself shaving.
I saw it, bright as the sun.

47:07.044 --> 47:09.546
Jack, we're hit in number 2!
Extinguisher!

47:10.130 --> 47:12.341
There goes an engine. Of course.

47:17.680 --> 47:19.056
Hey! Wake up, man!

47:19.640 --> 47:21.725
Check the oil pressure.

47:22.309 --> 47:25.938
Check the oil pressure!
Dropping.

47:26.522 --> 47:28.273
Check number 1!

47:28.857 --> 47:29.608
Number 1 OK.

47:30.818 --> 47:33.570
Is 9:30 okay? Nino says
he can't get us a table earlier.

47:34.154 --> 47:36.865
Gene, we're hit, throwing fuel!
We're going down!

47:37.449 --> 47:40.035
You still in gun range?
Yes.

47:40.953 --> 47:44.665
Change altitude and heading
every few seconds. Gimme a location.

47:47.292 --> 47:50.129
Jack! Got a minute? Location!
Stop snoozing!

47:53.132 --> 47:54.800
2 miles south of Tango 7.

47:56.093 --> 48:00.389
There's a strip just the other
side of Tango 7. Can you make it?

48:00.973 --> 48:02.099
Doubt it!

48:02.683 --> 48:04.393
Come on, man. You can make it.

48:05.144 --> 48:08.731
Jeez, I'll make it.
10 degrees right.

48:09.314 --> 48:10.983
Welcome back!

48:12.568 --> 48:13.444
Did I leave?

48:18.741 --> 48:22.411
Wild Dog to base.
Pilots in jeopardy near Tango 7.

48:22.995 --> 48:24.997
Am heading over there.

48:25.581 --> 48:28.417
Maintain course, Wild Dog.
We'll send a recon plane.

48:29.001 --> 48:31.378
Wild Dog, you copy?

48:31.962 --> 48:33.589
Wild Dog to base. Fuck off.

48:38.886 --> 48:40.304
Where we at?

48:41.096 --> 48:42.514
You see it?
No.

48:43.098 --> 48:44.391
1 o'clock.

48:45.726 --> 48:47.728
I got it.
Landing gear down!

48:48.312 --> 48:49.188
Coming down.

48:55.235 --> 48:58.614
It's not going down!
Don't worry. Go to manual.

49:04.578 --> 49:07.498
What have we got?
Nothing so far.

49:08.374 --> 49:11.377
We're gonna jump. Kwanh!
Put your 'chute on!

49:16.924 --> 49:19.635
You too, Neely.
Put your 'chute on, man!

49:20.219 --> 49:24.390
I'm riding it in with you.
No! I want you off!

49:26.767 --> 49:31.814
When I level out, jump! OK?
I'm taking it in with you! No!

49:33.273 --> 49:35.401
The only thing God
drops from the sky is bird shit!

49:35.984 --> 49:37.444
Bird shit and you!

49:38.028 --> 49:41.490
That's new.
Birdshit and catatonic pilots.

49:42.074 --> 49:43.242
Jump!

49:51.917 --> 49:53.377
OK, you're next!

49:54.628 --> 49:57.631
You're most vulnerable
floating down in a 'chute.

49:58.215 --> 50:00.050
I'll get a golden BB up my ass!

50:00.634 --> 50:04.430
If it doesn't open
I can use my reserve...

50:05.014 --> 50:06.515
Get up, man! Please!

50:08.308 --> 50:10.269
See you down there. Good luck!

50:14.940 --> 50:19.445
I have never had to
jump out of an airplane before!

50:22.573 --> 50:23.866
I'm a fucking den mother!

50:32.416 --> 50:34.543
OK, can you run, man? Let's go!

50:46.180 --> 50:48.390
What are you doing back here?

50:48.974 --> 50:51.393
I forgot my Nikon!
Here it is.

50:51.977 --> 50:54.730
You want it? Then jump!
Yes!

50:55.773 --> 50:57.441
You put on your parachute!

50:58.025 --> 50:59.485
I'm afraid of heights.

51:13.916 --> 51:14.792
Jump!

51:16.752 --> 51:17.961
Jump!

51:18.629 --> 51:19.546
Bye, now!

54:01.959 --> 54:04.461
Billy, come in.

54:18.642 --> 54:21.395
You satisfied or disappointed
that we're alive?

54:21.979 --> 54:26.275
The jungle is full of Commies
bandits, and headhunters.

54:26.859 --> 54:28.861
We're not alive yet.

54:30.612 --> 54:33.824
Want a piece of Juicy Fruit?
No, I do not.

54:34.408 --> 54:36.076
We going home!

54:36.660 --> 54:39.621
Soon, Kwanh.
No. We go now. Look!

54:42.249 --> 54:44.209
Look, we going home.

55:28.462 --> 55:29.755
Good afternoon!

55:34.134 --> 55:35.427
Hiya, General.

55:38.847 --> 55:40.432
Guess you missed us back there.

55:41.016 --> 55:44.770
Sure is nice
to see some "friendlies" down here.

55:46.021 --> 55:48.107
It's got a couple dings on it.

55:48.982 --> 55:52.236
Sure hope they don't
take it out of my paycheck.

55:53.988 --> 55:56.907
Nothin' a coupla days in the
shop won't fix...

55:59.243 --> 56:00.619
Lemme give you a hand.

56:07.501 --> 56:10.004
Guess you're in a hurry, huh?

56:11.588 --> 56:12.673
God, these are heavy!

56:13.257 --> 56:16.010
Gonna be a tight squeeze, huh?

56:16.593 --> 56:17.302
Hey, man!

56:19.513 --> 56:20.973
What about us?

56:26.228 --> 56:27.646
You're leaving us here?

56:29.398 --> 56:30.858
Goddammit! Fuck!

56:47.541 --> 56:49.626
We not go home now.

56:50.210 --> 56:52.463
Opium go home now.

56:53.213 --> 56:57.343
There was opium on that?
Opium, you got it.

56:58.761 --> 57:00.554
And he took it instead of us?

57:01.138 --> 57:03.599
You helped him load it, pal.

57:15.069 --> 57:19.198
You go north of the strip, I'll look
here. We'll find 'em.

57:19.782 --> 57:22.910
If we hurry we can still make
that 9:30 table at Nino's.

57:23.494 --> 57:25.829
Sounds good, Gene. See ya!

57:30.709 --> 57:33.170
Where is everybody?

57:37.925 --> 57:39.677
Quit it, OK?

58:00.406 --> 58:04.535
Trouble for our boys
off your right wing, jungle's

58:05.119 --> 58:07.079
crawlin' with black pyjamas.

58:35.858 --> 58:36.859
Billy, move!

59:02.092 --> 59:03.344
I quit!

59:19.485 --> 59:20.319
Any extra holes?

59:20.903 --> 59:24.615
No.
Wild Dog to base enemy at Tango 7.

59:25.199 --> 59:28.994
Everyone's unfriendly here.
Even the "friendlies!"

59:30.371 --> 59:33.207
Why are they so unfriendly?
They haven't gotten to know us yet.

59:36.627 --> 59:37.544
Why are they shooting?

59:38.128 --> 59:40.798
'Cause they're unfriendly.

59:48.305 --> 59:52.643
You're losing oil pressure...
I already lost tail rotor response.

59:54.895 --> 59:57.231
Put on your belt!

59:59.858 --> 01:00:05.114
I don't want to crash twice today!
But my crashes are the best!

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.866
You're at 40!

01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:12.413
You're redlining!

01:00:13.372 --> 01:00:15.624
You're redlining!

01:00:18.752 --> 01:00:21.422
Autorotate!
Wild Dog to base.

01:00:22.006 --> 01:00:25.217
We're going in 3/4 of a mile
southwest of Tango 7.

01:00:48.741 --> 01:00:52.828
Great rescue, huh?
I thought you had this blessed.

01:00:53.412 --> 01:00:56.040
I thought the monk wasn't
really concentrating.

01:00:56.623 --> 01:00:58.292
We gotta drop, you know.

01:00:58.876 --> 01:01:01.712
No, man.
We gotta, we're sniper bait.

01:01:02.296 --> 01:01:05.007
Who goes first?
There's no fast rule

01:01:05.591 --> 01:01:09.178
about crashing through the cockpit.
You go first.

01:01:09.762 --> 01:01:11.930
I don't want to go first!
I'll go. I don't want to go 2nd!

01:01:12.514 --> 01:01:14.767
We'll toss a coin.

01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:16.310
Call!

01:01:16.894 --> 01:01:17.561
Tails.

01:01:19.271 --> 01:01:21.857
Is that heads? Is that tails?
Tails.

01:01:22.524 --> 01:01:24.026
Heads.
That's tails. I'll check.

01:01:41.335 --> 01:01:42.211
Come on!

01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:44.296
It's pretty soft.

01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:47.049
I hate going second.

01:02:05.275 --> 01:02:08.487
Well that fall
seemed to go pretty well.

01:02:20.249 --> 01:02:23.085
We should get moving.

01:02:23.711 --> 01:02:26.005
Can you walk?
Walk?

01:02:26.588 --> 01:02:28.924
We're in the goddamned jungle!

01:02:54.992 --> 01:02:58.412
Give me voice. Gene. Billy.

01:03:01.248 --> 01:03:03.625
Come in, Gene, Billy.

01:03:04.418 --> 01:03:05.919
Do you read me?

01:03:23.312 --> 01:03:26.148
Gene and Billy, where are you?

01:03:32.154 --> 01:03:34.698
Billy and Gene, do you read me?

01:03:56.345 --> 01:03:58.681
I stole some stuff as a kid.

01:03:59.932 --> 01:04:02.893
Whiffle balls, model airplanes.

01:04:03.435 --> 01:04:06.355
I used a fake I D to drink
smoked some reefers.

01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:08.732
I performed oral sex
where it's against the law.

01:04:09.274 --> 01:04:13.237
But until I worked for my own
government, I never smuggled drugs.

01:04:13.779 --> 01:04:16.949
We're not smugglers
just pack mules.

01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:21.286
No one wins war here without
control of the opium trade.

01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:25.916
We help Soong get his crop to market.
He helps us fight the war.

01:04:26.458 --> 01:04:28.669
Don't give me
that cooled out Buddhist shit!

01:04:29.211 --> 01:04:32.589
Our government is running a war
with drug money

01:04:33.132 --> 01:04:35.509
and our GI's are getting
strung out in Vietnam!

01:04:36.051 --> 01:04:39.013
You might as well throw rattlesnakes
in the schoolyard!

01:04:40.014 --> 01:04:43.934
This doesn't bother your soul?
Leave my soul out of this.

01:04:44.476 --> 01:04:48.063
We don't work officially for the
US government.

01:04:48.605 --> 01:04:54.278
Everybody knows.
What happens if you say CIA?

01:04:59.783 --> 01:05:03.162
Let's change course. Maybe
we'll be outta here by morning.

01:05:03.704 --> 01:05:05.664
How many more miles?

01:05:20.804 --> 01:05:24.641
When the sales rep from
Bell Helicopters gets here

01:05:25.184 --> 01:05:30.064
go easy on him, not like that
asshole from Dow Chemicals.

01:05:30.606 --> 01:05:33.150
Nice and easy. Bring him here

01:05:33.692 --> 01:05:36.945
vintage wine
blah blah blah, elegant dining

01:05:37.488 --> 01:05:40.407
get him blown at the White Rose

01:05:40.949 --> 01:05:45.913
brandy, espresso. Then just
hit him up for the two free choppers.

01:05:46.455 --> 01:05:49.458
I'm a little nervous about it.
Buona sera, signore.

01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:52.503
I have heard about
the pilots shooted down.

01:05:53.045 --> 01:05:55.923
I hope they safe. I pray for them.

01:05:56.465 --> 01:05:58.967
Thank you. Every prayer helps.

01:06:05.432 --> 01:06:09.144
I have to have coffee with Davenport.
What should I do?

01:06:09.687 --> 01:06:12.523
I'll take him to the White Rose.
I'll get him blown.

01:06:13.065 --> 01:06:14.316
No.
No. What?

01:06:14.858 --> 01:06:18.237
Davenport runs
the Senate prayer group.

01:06:18.779 --> 01:06:21.949
With him, you don't
bring up the subject of blow jobs.

01:06:22.908 --> 01:06:24.451
You let him bring it up.

01:06:35.254 --> 01:06:36.171
Jesus!

01:06:36.714 --> 01:06:37.673
Again?

01:06:38.215 --> 01:06:41.051
Restaurant closed!
Health violation.

01:06:41.593 --> 01:06:43.053
All go home now!

01:06:43.595 --> 01:06:45.305
Everybody go now!!

01:06:50.477 --> 01:06:54.440
I do business with round eyes
all my life!

01:06:54.982 --> 01:06:57.568
But I don't let a
Corsican fuck me!

01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:58.861
You crazy?

01:06:59.403 --> 01:07:02.197
I pick up opium myself!
In bad danger!

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.367
Your men
don't want to pay same same last time!

01:07:05.909 --> 01:07:09.079
No more break this china!
Understand?

01:07:10.706 --> 01:07:12.082
Now I tell you something.

01:07:12.624 --> 01:07:15.085
I talk to Marseilles.
I talk to New York.

01:07:16.128 --> 01:07:18.130
They say Opium not so good this year.

01:07:18.672 --> 01:07:22.051
Been cut with baking powder.
So who fucking who?

01:07:22.593 --> 01:07:25.971
No, I no gonna pay you same same.
You give me shit!

01:07:26.597 --> 01:07:30.976
Nino. You listen to me.
You pay same same

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:34.355
or you never use my planes again.

01:07:39.193 --> 01:07:41.111
OK, pay same same.

01:08:28.325 --> 01:08:30.452
So this is
the face of modern Communism?

01:08:30.995 --> 01:08:34.372
Wrong. A devout Communist
carries an AK 47

01:08:34.915 --> 01:08:37.626
they have the
oldest weapons known to man.

01:08:38.167 --> 01:08:40.837
These are hillbillies.

01:08:41.755 --> 01:08:45.926
And they're pissed.
They don't cotton to outsiders.

01:08:56.603 --> 01:08:58.564
What're they saying?

01:08:59.982 --> 01:09:02.276
I'm surprised
they haven't killed us yet.

01:09:02.818 --> 01:09:05.529
Surprised?
How come you're so relaxed?

01:09:06.071 --> 01:09:11.243
Don't you get it? When you die
that's it! Blackness.

01:09:12.118 --> 01:09:14.662
They stick you in a box
in the ground.

01:09:15.205 --> 01:09:18.250
Don't even let you
out on weekends. Depressing.

01:09:18.792 --> 01:09:20.044
Right. Nothing.

01:09:20.794 --> 01:09:23.130
Buddha says...
Stop it!

01:09:23.671 --> 01:09:26.425
A real Buddhist
wouldn't be running guns.

01:09:27.968 --> 01:09:32.973
You're a hustler. Call it
Religion, but you're a hustler.

01:09:33.807 --> 01:09:36.894
I never said
I was a good Buddhist.

01:09:41.064 --> 01:09:42.774
They're gonna do it.

01:09:45.277 --> 01:09:47.154
You don't need to speed things up!

01:09:48.197 --> 01:09:51.241
Those guns are all wrong
for the rainy conditions.

01:09:51.783 --> 01:09:54.328
You need all weather weapons.

01:09:54.870 --> 01:10:00.376
Your guns were made in France
for the desert warfare.

01:10:02.586 --> 01:10:07.091
I hope you didn't pay
more than two pigs for it.

01:10:08.884 --> 01:10:09.718
A cow.

01:10:10.678 --> 01:10:12.221
Yeah, I know.

01:10:12.763 --> 01:10:16.350
A cow?
For a stupid musket?

01:10:18.644 --> 01:10:20.270
You got taken!

01:10:21.438 --> 01:10:24.608
D'ya hear?
A cow for this gun!

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:27.027
Isn't that hysterical?

01:10:29.154 --> 01:10:32.199
Ever shot it in the rain?

01:10:38.247 --> 01:10:39.665
I reckon.

01:10:40.207 --> 01:10:41.834
For all weather guns

01:10:42.376 --> 01:10:45.546
at great prices.

01:10:46.088 --> 01:10:48.048
We should go to my brother in law.

01:10:48.632 --> 01:10:49.925
He lives

01:10:50.467 --> 01:10:53.554
two days walk from here.
What do you think?

01:10:54.096 --> 01:10:57.766
Gentlemen, these guns are cherry.

01:11:04.106 --> 01:11:05.941
Deal.

01:11:12.031 --> 01:11:14.116
Hello? Mei ling?

01:11:24.126 --> 01:11:26.628
I missed you!
Oh, I couldn't tell.

01:11:47.107 --> 01:11:48.359
This is my wife.

01:11:48.901 --> 01:11:51.654
Come in to civilization
and get cleaned up!

01:11:56.784 --> 01:11:59.995
You don't look like a guy
who'd live in a place like this.

01:12:03.332 --> 01:12:05.834
Looks'll fool you every time.

01:12:06.752 --> 01:12:08.253
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:12:08.796 --> 01:12:10.422
Do you believe in this war?

01:12:11.757 --> 01:12:14.176
I used to believe in all these wars.

01:12:17.137 --> 01:12:18.972
I had a theory once.

01:12:19.515 --> 01:12:22.226
The politics of Saturday night.

01:12:23.268 --> 01:12:27.815
I rated all countries on how good
their Saturday nights were.

01:12:28.357 --> 01:12:32.236
I knew that Moscow and Peking
were a stone drag on Saturday.

01:12:34.071 --> 01:12:37.241
So I was flying for a cause.

01:12:37.783 --> 01:12:40.953
To defend barbecues
and weenie roasts

01:12:41.495 --> 01:12:45.874
and Ray Charles songs and
Southern Comfort 'till you pass out.

01:12:47.042 --> 01:12:49.878
The politics of Saturday night.
I can relate.

01:12:50.421 --> 01:12:53.924
Not bad is it?
But not particularly true.

01:12:54.466 --> 01:12:56.802
I hear they party hard in Moscow.

01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:01.515
Don't give up a good theory
just because it's not true.

01:13:16.238 --> 01:13:18.407
So why don't you go home?

01:13:21.076 --> 01:13:25.205
Look at me, Neely, the rest.
We're trouble junkies.

01:13:25.748 --> 01:13:29.460
Nothing but adrenaline gets us off.
It's kinda sick.

01:13:31.045 --> 01:13:35.090
Quit before you pick up the habit.
And you will!

01:13:37.426 --> 01:13:41.555
Go back to LA and be
the weirdest guy in the room again.

01:13:42.097 --> 01:13:44.266
I gotta take care of something first.

01:13:45.642 --> 01:13:48.646
You wanna get even?

01:13:49.647 --> 01:13:51.398
With who? Rob? Soong?

01:13:53.817 --> 01:13:56.236
Forget it! This is the orient.

01:13:56.779 --> 01:13:59.907
What Soong did to you was nothing!

01:14:01.784 --> 01:14:05.913
I've seen things here
that I never could have imagined.

01:14:06.455 --> 01:14:09.208
And I have a broad imagination.

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:13.045
Why don't you just go home.

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.509
This is one of the most famous
temples in Laos.

01:14:19.051 --> 01:14:20.803
I've been here four days.

01:14:21.345 --> 01:14:24.848
I've seen 19 Buddhas
3 tailors, a silk factory

01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:28.185
and you haven't told me
one new thing about the dope trade.

01:14:28.727 --> 01:14:32.106
I'm leaving soon and
I'm not going back empty handed.

01:14:32.648 --> 01:14:35.234
I need heads on a platter

01:14:36.777 --> 01:14:40.990
or the rumors will get you
on the hill. What rumors?

01:14:41.532 --> 01:14:43.701
You heard the man, Rob.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.620
Heads on a platter.

01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:21.572
Is that Paul Bunyan's condom?

01:15:23.449 --> 01:15:25.826
That's the point of the drop.

01:15:26.368 --> 01:15:28.704
Penis size is very
important to Asian people.

01:15:29.246 --> 01:15:33.834
If we can convince them that
American men use this jumbo size

01:15:34.376 --> 01:15:37.880
their men will start to fear us.

01:15:40.007 --> 01:15:43.135
Dismissed. One more thing, guys.

01:15:45.929 --> 01:15:49.683
Jack Neely's body
was recovered last night.

01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:53.354
He was shot down by the Pathet Lao

01:15:53.896 --> 01:15:56.398
while looking for Covington and Ryack.

01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:01.445
I understand how you must feel

01:16:01.987 --> 01:16:05.908
but in the interest of security
you must be quiet about it.

01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:10.204
Before you keep us quiet again
could we have a moment of silence?

01:16:40.526 --> 01:16:43.487
"Visit colorful native village"
reads my schedule, Gene.

01:16:44.029 --> 01:16:47.992
But we've been here 6 hours.
I think we can say I've seen it.

01:16:48.534 --> 01:16:51.453
They're nearly finished.

01:16:51.996 --> 01:16:55.082
What is that, Gene? A boat?

01:16:56.166 --> 01:16:57.376
Sort of.

01:16:57.918 --> 01:17:00.921
You a strange man, Gene.

01:17:02.172 --> 01:17:04.008
Thank you for noticing, General.

01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:08.012
You love old ways.
Asian ways.

01:17:08.554 --> 01:17:10.889
General Soong love

01:17:11.432 --> 01:17:14.852
tomorrow ways. Modern world.

01:17:20.024 --> 01:17:22.735
Our friend here's a little tipsy.

01:17:24.528 --> 01:17:27.156
He's high on America.
I've seen it before.

01:17:27.698 --> 01:17:31.160
It's stronger than whisky.
Bigger than opium.

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.581
He's stoned on
dreams of the USA.

01:17:39.251 --> 01:17:40.794
Gene, you just mentioned opium.

01:17:42.796 --> 01:17:45.215
Now, tell me
let the chips fall where they may.

01:17:45.758 --> 01:17:48.969
Was Jack Neely flying dope
when he went down?

01:17:59.271 --> 01:18:01.774
Let's take this to the plane.

01:18:02.316 --> 01:18:03.776
You're taking that kayak with you?

01:18:04.318 --> 01:18:06.945
This is Jack Neely's coffin.

01:18:07.488 --> 01:18:10.866
I promised him they wouldn't
send him home in a body bag.

01:18:11.408 --> 01:18:14.536
And, no, he wasn't flying dope.

01:18:15.704 --> 01:18:16.914
General! Wake up!

01:18:21.251 --> 01:18:23.671
I'm here to drink to Jack Neely.
Join me?

01:18:27.132 --> 01:18:27.966
To Jack!

01:18:29.051 --> 01:18:32.054
He wanted it like that. He'd have
been real angry to die in bed.

01:18:45.359 --> 01:18:50.656
I'm leaving. I sent Mei Ling
and the kids ahead. What the fuck?

01:18:51.198 --> 01:18:55.244
I've got a buyer for all my guns.
I'm gonna pick 'em all up

01:18:55.786 --> 01:19:01.250
and sell 'em in one hit.
You gonna be a farmer in Thailand?

01:19:03.335 --> 01:19:05.462
What about the rest of us?

01:19:06.005 --> 01:19:09.758
Should we go home and sell
aluminum siding?

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.136
They're gonna shut this war down soon.

01:19:12.678 --> 01:19:16.265
There'll be a new one opening
in a theatre near you.

01:19:16.807 --> 01:19:18.767
Promise?
I promise.

01:19:23.397 --> 01:19:26.650
I was with the Senator all day.

01:19:27.192 --> 01:19:30.863
The spooks are lookin' for fall guys.
So watch out.

01:19:40.956 --> 01:19:42.666
Where you been?

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:44.209
Just around.

01:19:45.002 --> 01:19:48.339
I did some shopping
on the black market. Bought grenades.

01:19:48.881 --> 01:19:51.675
Now I'm gonna have some fun.

01:19:52.217 --> 01:19:54.470
Big fun.

01:19:55.012 --> 01:19:56.847
Noisy fun.

01:19:57.389 --> 01:19:59.558
Doesn't sound like well planned fun.

01:20:00.934 --> 01:20:04.021
Like I said
I tend to fuck up on the ground.

01:20:04.688 --> 01:20:06.482
I wouldn't do this if I was you.

01:20:07.024 --> 01:20:08.275
I know.

01:20:08.984 --> 01:20:11.695
But then you wouldn't do anything.

01:20:12.237 --> 01:20:13.155
See you later.

01:20:14.156 --> 01:20:16.116
Can I have a soda?

01:20:26.919 --> 01:20:28.212
Sure, here you go.

01:22:38.509 --> 01:22:41.387
I know who do this! That new kid!

01:22:41.929 --> 01:22:44.431
The guards saw him running away.
Word on the street is

01:22:44.974 --> 01:22:47.434
it's Communist sabotage.

01:22:47.977 --> 01:22:50.604
I don't give a rat's ass who did it.

01:22:51.397 --> 01:22:56.360
The whole operation is gonna blow up
in our faces, with the Senator here.

01:22:56.902 --> 01:23:00.739
We've got to do some
immediate damage control.

01:23:06.704 --> 01:23:10.916
With your indulgence:
Could I have two kilos?

01:23:19.133 --> 01:23:22.511
These two kilos are for the cause.

01:23:24.972 --> 01:23:25.639
Yes, sir.

01:23:30.894 --> 01:23:33.230
That's right, C 123, personal use.

01:23:33.772 --> 01:23:35.899
Pretty big for personal use.

01:23:36.442 --> 01:23:40.112
You found a buyer for your guns?
Nail on the head.

01:23:40.654 --> 01:23:42.531
How you doing?
Very well.

01:23:43.073 --> 01:23:47.745
What you taking today?
Flour sacks to Bien Thuong.

01:23:48.412 --> 01:23:52.082
That's near Tango 7.
Planning on crashing any planes?

01:23:52.624 --> 01:23:57.463
Not today. You already
cost this company enough.

01:23:58.005 --> 01:24:00.507
What do you mean?

01:24:04.428 --> 01:24:06.972
Feel better?
Much better.

01:24:07.514 --> 01:24:11.518
The cloud of opium smoke
in town got everybody high.

01:24:12.061 --> 01:24:14.980
You actually shut the plant down
for three whole hours.

01:24:15.522 --> 01:24:17.816
Didn't start it 'till this morning.

01:24:19.026 --> 01:24:20.319
That's the way it is.

01:24:40.089 --> 01:24:42.633
All set?
All set.

01:24:48.847 --> 01:24:50.349
Bien Thuong, huh?

01:25:28.012 --> 01:25:31.015
You! Move truck out! Quick!

01:25:37.313 --> 01:25:39.398
Keep movin', Audrey!

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:41.525
You get truck out!

01:25:42.359 --> 01:25:44.486
Hey! Calm down!

01:25:45.029 --> 01:25:49.742
You get your opium fields.
We need a few hours to move!

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.048
Base to Stagger Lee. Come in!

01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:06.800
Base to Stagger Lee. Over.

01:26:07.343 --> 01:26:11.263
Slight change in you flight plan.
Head to LS 18

01:26:11.805 --> 01:26:15.225
for a routine inspection.
Inspection?

01:26:15.768 --> 01:26:18.187
Affirmative.
We just read 'em.

01:26:19.229 --> 01:26:21.190
Check. Heading for LS 18.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.365
I'm going to LS 18
for a routine inspection.

01:26:29.907 --> 01:26:32.660
Routine inspection? Never heard of it.

01:26:35.204 --> 01:26:37.331
Then it ain't routine.

01:26:40.584 --> 01:26:42.336
Babo, check on the cargo.
What's up?

01:26:42.878 --> 01:26:45.255
I don't know. Check it, will you?

01:27:00.437 --> 01:27:03.732
I hope to God
our information's wrong.

01:27:04.274 --> 01:27:06.777
It'd break my heart
if Heroin was on that plane.

01:27:07.319 --> 01:27:11.365
The pilot does come from California.
I see.

01:27:11.907 --> 01:27:14.034
Caught up in the youth culture bit?

01:27:14.576 --> 01:27:17.162
Too much Rock 'n Roll.

01:27:18.831 --> 01:27:23.043
Still, he's only one young man.
Why do we need all these men.

01:27:23.585 --> 01:27:25.963
Pilots are tough men, Senator.

01:27:26.505 --> 01:27:28.841
This one might resist
with force.

01:27:29.341 --> 01:27:33.846
Our information says he's
a cool and ruthless customer.

01:27:39.143 --> 01:27:40.102
Nothing!

01:27:40.644 --> 01:27:43.647
Listen, we're being set up.
Keep looking!

01:27:44.189 --> 01:27:46.191
Are you serious?
Yeah, cut 'em open!

01:27:55.034 --> 01:27:57.202
What you got?
Nothing.

01:28:14.636 --> 01:28:16.305
Hurry up!

01:28:18.807 --> 01:28:19.683
Got it!

01:28:21.393 --> 01:28:23.354
I knew it!

01:28:25.439 --> 01:28:28.901
Look at those bastards
waiting for us!

01:28:33.238 --> 01:28:36.992
They want us busted.
Dead and busted.

01:28:42.665 --> 01:28:45.626
Somebody messed with the fuel gauge!
We're running out!

01:28:47.586 --> 01:28:50.631
I'm heading for Tango 7.

01:28:51.173 --> 01:28:54.635
Wait, Billy!
They can follow us there!

01:28:55.177 --> 01:28:57.596
We'll figure it out.
Don't say we, man!

01:28:58.138 --> 01:29:01.517
I'm 42 and I never figured out
anything in my fuckin' life.

01:29:15.197 --> 01:29:18.575
He's not landing, Rob.
He's only got enough fuel to...

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.747
Start 'em up! Let's go after 'em!

01:29:40.472 --> 01:29:42.891
We're VSF, man!

01:29:43.434 --> 01:29:46.103
VSF?
Very severely fucked!

01:30:13.339 --> 01:30:17.968
Good flying, Covington.
Ever do any valet parking?

01:30:21.055 --> 01:30:23.474
Looks like we're gonna make it.

01:30:24.016 --> 01:30:27.186
What are we gonna do on the ground?
I'm workin' on it!

01:30:39.198 --> 01:30:40.366
Come on!

01:30:40.991 --> 01:30:42.368
Come on!

01:31:03.263 --> 01:31:06.558
You're too fast!
Hold on! What?

01:31:07.101 --> 01:31:09.144
Pull up! Pull up!

01:31:09.687 --> 01:31:12.731
What are you doing?
Shut up!

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:16.610
Are you fucking nuts?
Head down, now.

01:31:17.152 --> 01:31:18.237
Down!

01:31:36.422 --> 01:31:40.092
I never would have thought of it.
It just came to me.

01:31:40.634 --> 01:31:42.511
I'm gonna buy you some beers!

01:31:49.810 --> 01:31:51.770
Lousy week, man.

01:31:52.354 --> 01:31:54.773
Gene, come in, Gene!

01:32:00.112 --> 01:32:01.196
Bullshit.

01:32:02.197 --> 01:32:03.282
'Scuse me.

01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:08.495
It's Babo here. Gene come in!

01:32:09.204 --> 01:32:11.165
This is Gene. What's up?

01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:16.170
He did it again?
Can't he keep the thing in the air?

01:32:16.712 --> 01:32:18.339
I'll think about it.

01:32:24.345 --> 01:32:27.348
Nope, no more money.
Speak English.

01:33:26.615 --> 01:33:29.284
Where'd he go, Rob?
I don't know!

01:33:29.827 --> 01:33:32.329
Well, Senator
looks like we've lost him.

01:33:33.872 --> 01:33:37.459
Maybe my trip hasn't
been a complete loss.

01:33:38.002 --> 01:33:40.421
Maybe I found those rotten apples
after all.

01:33:40.963 --> 01:33:44.675
I beg your pardon, sir?
I may wear shorts in the jungle.

01:33:45.217 --> 01:33:49.388
And say, "gosh" and "doo doo"
but I know a frame up when I see one.

01:33:50.139 --> 01:33:54.393
Unless my eyes deceive me...
They probably do...

01:33:54.935 --> 01:33:57.855
You are a highly decorated soldier...

01:33:58.397 --> 01:34:00.816
Senator, kiss my highly decorated ass!

01:34:02.484 --> 01:34:06.405
I tried to make it easy for you
but there's no way to please you.

01:34:06.947 --> 01:34:09.950
I'll tell you what.
You go back to Washington

01:34:10.492 --> 01:34:12.870
go straight to the White House

01:34:13.412 --> 01:34:16.540
and pour your heart out
about what you think you saw here.

01:34:17.082 --> 01:34:22.046
Then sit back and watch
your political career die.

01:34:22.588 --> 01:34:27.176
You can't touch me without
cutting your own throat.

01:34:28.802 --> 01:34:31.972
You know why?
Because the President loves my ass!

01:34:33.557 --> 01:34:35.517
You really are second level, Rob.

01:34:38.479 --> 01:34:40.439
We go home now!

01:35:23.899 --> 01:35:26.443
Glad you could make it!

01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:31.740
Where's your bus?
Long story.

01:35:43.252 --> 01:35:47.506
Well, it's my last stop, boys.
One more pick up, then I off load.

01:35:48.048 --> 01:35:50.175
It's gravy from there on in.

01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:55.764
I had a map someplace
with the stops marked in crayon.

01:35:56.307 --> 01:35:57.766
Here it is.

01:35:58.684 --> 01:36:01.020
Navigate me to sky blue, please.

01:36:03.188 --> 01:36:04.857
Look at all the "friendlies."

01:36:05.399 --> 01:36:08.319
Soong's troops.
Been listening all morning.

01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:13.699
He's worried someone'll get
to the poppy fields before him.

01:36:14.241 --> 01:36:17.703
That's by the refugee camp, too.
That's where the poppies are.

01:36:42.061 --> 01:36:45.439
They're no more trucks
no more choppers.

01:36:45.981 --> 01:36:49.652
You go ahead, I'll send a call.
Corinne!

01:37:09.713 --> 01:37:13.092
Mayday! This is Scout Camp 1.
Enemy troops are moving in

01:37:13.634 --> 01:37:16.845
on General Soong
and we're caught in the cross fire.

01:37:17.388 --> 01:37:19.640
Request immediate assistance!

01:37:20.766 --> 01:37:23.936
Mayday! This is Scout Camp 1

01:37:24.478 --> 01:37:25.896
requesting assistance.

01:37:27.481 --> 01:37:30.150
Mayday
we're under heavy mortar fire!

01:37:33.028 --> 01:37:36.949
This is Pirelli. We're about 15
minutes away. Anyone closer?

01:37:37.783 --> 01:37:41.537
We'll head in if nobody is closer.
Call us, please!

01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:46.083
Mayday, mayday! To all aircraft!
We're under heave mortar fire

01:37:46.625 --> 01:37:50.004
at Scout Camp 1.
Do you read?

01:37:50.546 --> 01:37:54.008
Saunders and Pirelli
are almost as close as we are.

01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:57.177
Yeah
we're only about 5 minutes closer.

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.054
At the most.

01:38:01.181 --> 01:38:02.599
Shut up!

01:38:03.142 --> 01:38:06.478
I've planned this day for a long time!
I didn't say anything!

01:38:07.021 --> 01:38:09.982
I don't have time to pick up
lost social workers!

01:38:10.524 --> 01:38:13.402
She chose to be there herself.

01:38:13.944 --> 01:38:16.989
I already pick you guys up.
I appreciate it.

01:38:17.531 --> 01:38:20.534
Thank you. She knew
what she was doing.

01:38:21.076 --> 01:38:22.411
God dammit!

01:38:22.953 --> 01:38:24.997
5 minutes won't kill us.

01:38:25.539 --> 01:38:28.667
She's skinny
she'll sit on a machine gun.

01:38:29.501 --> 01:38:30.961
Give me the heading.

01:38:31.503 --> 01:38:33.672
160. Are you sure?

01:38:34.214 --> 01:38:35.758
Shut up!

01:38:40.054 --> 01:38:44.099
Keep your hands off the wheel.
We know what happens when you fly.

01:38:45.517 --> 01:38:48.646
We haven't heard.
Is anybody coming? Call us.

01:38:49.396 --> 01:38:53.067
I was changing in a phone booth.
We'll get her.

01:39:20.052 --> 01:39:22.221
This was a good idea of yours!

01:40:27.328 --> 01:40:31.206
I knew you guys would make it!
I think we can get everybody on board.

01:40:31.749 --> 01:40:34.543
No, we just came back for you.
He's fully loaded.

01:40:35.085 --> 01:40:36.420
Dump the fucking cargo!

01:40:37.504 --> 01:40:41.550
That's a problem.
I'm not leaving without them.

01:40:43.761 --> 01:40:45.596
Let's get this kid and get outta here!

01:40:49.642 --> 01:40:50.809
Come on!

01:40:52.269 --> 01:40:53.395
Let's go!

01:40:59.318 --> 01:41:00.778
Get on the plane.

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.322
Not without these people!

01:41:03.864 --> 01:41:06.283
We came here to get you.
Get on the fucking plane!

01:41:06.825 --> 01:41:08.452
Dump your cargo.

01:41:27.513 --> 01:41:28.681
One minute.

01:41:30.307 --> 01:41:34.687
I got a crazy idea:
Cargo out, people in.

01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:36.313
Great!
Please!

01:41:36.855 --> 01:41:38.524
You better hurry.
You gotta do it.

01:41:39.066 --> 01:41:42.569
Otherwise you're just a 2nd Lemond
with a hipper rap.

01:41:45.364 --> 01:41:46.573
Knock it off, will ya?

01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:56.166
Goddamn!

01:41:58.043 --> 01:41:59.420
Hey, Mother Theresa!

01:41:59.962 --> 01:42:02.798
I was gonna do it anyway.
But I hate being lectured!

01:42:27.197 --> 01:42:29.158
"Slightly hipper rap?"

01:43:00.397 --> 01:43:02.691
Let's go! Quickly!

01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:13.577
Get up front and give it some stick!
Those shells are close.

01:44:36.285 --> 01:44:39.330
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard Air America Flight 1.

01:44:41.999 --> 01:44:45.502
You can unfasten your seatbelts
as soon as we're out of gun range.

01:44:46.211 --> 01:44:48.589
I'd like to
apologize for that ground delay.

01:44:49.131 --> 01:44:51.258
We experienced material turbulence.

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.928
On entertainment channel 3
you can hear music from

01:44:55.471 --> 01:44:59.433
that group "Gene Ryack and
the Redemption!"

01:45:00.017 --> 01:45:04.563
The Captain now has to explain to his
family what he did with their savings.

01:45:05.105 --> 01:45:06.523
Our flight path

01:45:07.066 --> 01:45:10.152
takes us over Anaheim
Azusa and the Mekong Delta

01:45:10.694 --> 01:45:12.655
to...

01:45:14.782 --> 01:45:15.783
Where we going?

01:45:16.325 --> 01:45:20.871
You're gonna help me make
my money back that you lost.

01:45:21.413 --> 01:45:24.583
I made you lose it?
I merely suggested.

01:45:25.125 --> 01:45:27.503
Do not blame me for the single
decent act of your adult life.

01:45:28.253 --> 01:45:30.506
Besides, where do I get the money?

01:45:32.383 --> 01:45:38.055
Here at crazy Gene's we've slashed
the prices on used C 123's.

01:45:38.597 --> 01:45:40.599
For your private army...
Forget it!

01:45:41.141 --> 01:45:43.936
No more problems
with those pesky border troops!

01:45:44.478 --> 01:45:46.522
This plane is US Government property.

01:45:47.064 --> 01:45:51.026
The US Government doesn't exist
in Laos. Neither does this plane.

01:45:52.152 --> 01:45:53.153
Right.

01:45:53.696 --> 01:45:57.199
We'll do what we do best.

01:45:57.741 --> 01:45:59.243
We fly!
