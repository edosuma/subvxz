Season 07 Episode 11

00:12.210 --> 00:14.570
Have you made the preparations?

00:14.570 --> 00:16.040
Are you sure you want to leave now, colonel?

00:16.079 --> 00:18.080
Can't imagine general Juma
will be pleased to learn

00:18.120 --> 00:19.430
that you're abandoning your mission.

00:19.470 --> 00:20.790
The mission is over.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.600
You think I'm a fool, Mr Burnett?

00:22.640 --> 00:24.830
If anything should happen to me
on my way out of the country,

00:24.870 --> 00:27.770
the data file with all the names and
bank transactions of all those involved

00:27.810 --> 00:30.420
will be sent to the justice department.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.659
When the car arrives, we would
like you to go with the driver

00:32.700 --> 00:34.560
so that we could follow you back to Dubaku.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.480
You want her to go to him and face him?

00:36.520 --> 00:39.510
It's the only chance we have of finding
him before he disappears forever.

00:39.550 --> 00:40.410
I'll do it.

00:40.410 --> 00:42.250
You keep her safe, you hear me?

00:42.290 --> 00:44.650
We will.

00:45.700 --> 00:46.770
Colonel!

00:46.770 --> 00:49.110
FBI. Go! Go!

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

00:59.180 --> 01:01.010
I want the names of everyone in
the United States government

01:01.050 --> 01:02.490
that you've been working with.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.530
I have a list.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.450
I found some kind of digital storage
device implanted under Dubaku's skin.

01:06.490 --> 01:08.300
Can you upload the files to FBI?

01:08.340 --> 01:10.680
Marika didn't make it.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.640
You killed my sister.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.250
I'm so sorry.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.450
What do you want from me⁈

01:14.490 --> 01:16.240
I just want to know that you feel something.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.410
I want to know that you feel the
same kind of pain that I do!

01:19.450 --> 01:22.080
Do you feel that⁈

01:23.590 --> 01:26.140
I'm working with FBI to
coordinate an interagency sweep.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.830
We should start making arrests within the hour.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.800
What you have done here today
puts all of us in your debt.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.300
There are a lot of people to
thank, including Jack Bauer.

01:33.340 --> 01:35.600
What are you asking me to do, bill?

01:35.640 --> 01:37.330
I'm asking you to speak to senator Mayer.

01:37.370 --> 01:39.490
Jack Bauer helped save this country.

01:39.530 --> 01:42.290
He doesn't deserve to spend the
rest of his life in prison.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.660
–I'm going to the white house.
–Sir?

01:43.700 --> 01:46.720
President Taylor wants to speak
to me regarding Jack Bauer.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.090
Grab your laptop, Ryan.

01:48.130 --> 01:50.000
I want you there with me.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.350
There's gonna be another attack.

01:51.390 --> 01:55.880
Here in DC. My source tells me that
the window opens at 1900 hours.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.840
What's the target?

01:57.840 --> 01:59.330
He doesn't know the exact target,

01:59.370 --> 02:03.060
but it's definitely going to be
of high value and high impact.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.380
He gave me the name of somebody who's
been involved in the planning.

02:05.420 --> 02:06.850
–Who?
–Ryan Burnett.

02:06.850 --> 02:08.259
Senator Mayer's chief of staff.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.169
That's right.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.050
hold on a second.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.860
Go ahead.

02:42.710 --> 02:44.290
ICU.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.760
One moment, please.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.520
Corinna, you got a call on three.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.860
–Who is it?
–Dr May. He's got a question.

02:53.860 --> 02:55.930
Doctors are so helpless.

02:55.930 --> 03:00.520
Dr May? Hello?

03:01.650 --> 03:03.280
There was no one there.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.160
If he calls back, tell him I'll
call him back in a minute.

03:11.070 --> 03:12.320
code blue. Code blue!

03:12.360 --> 03:14.150
We have a code blue in the ICU!

03:14.190 --> 03:17.240
Get agent walker down to ICU now!

03:19.790 --> 03:24.770
Swift and decisive is how the Pentagon describes
the U.S invasion now underway in Sangala.  

03:24.810 --> 03:27.360
“Sporadic resistance, minimal casualties.”

03:27.400 --> 03:33.390
This in direct contrast to assertions
made by Sangalese leader Benjamin
Juma on state-supported television.

03:33.430 --> 03:38.920
Our brave soldiers are beating back
the enemy all across Sangala city.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.180
History is on our side, my friends.

03:42.180 --> 03:48.440
We survived their slave ships, and
we will survive their warships, too.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.300
Declaring victory while his own
troops are fleeing the capital,

03:51.340 --> 03:53.650
and his palace lies in ruins.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.880
When do we think this was made?

03:55.880 --> 03:59.490
My guess is these recordings were made
some time before the invasion, ma'am.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.140
Which begs the question, John.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.210
Where is he and why haven't we found him yet?

04:03.250 --> 04:07.850
Special forces teams all over
Sangala city are searing for him.

04:07.850 --> 04:11.110
There is some intelligence to suggest
he may have fled the country.

04:11.150 --> 04:15.030
Admiral Smith, you and I both
know that Juma must be captured.

04:15.070 --> 04:18.000
He must be tried and convicted
of his crimes against humanity.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.089
Otherwise, we've as good as failed.

04:20.130 --> 04:21.750
He can't go far, ma'am.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.480
No country on earth will grant him asylum.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.440
Then find him, admiral Smith.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.240
Wherever he is.

04:32.370 --> 04:35.180
General Juma?

04:35.180 --> 04:38.170
Beautiful, isn't it?

04:38.170 --> 04:39.540
Sir?

04:39.540 --> 04:41.730
It's not a trick question, Laurent.

04:41.770 --> 04:43.670
It is beautiful.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.360
Why not?

04:47.020 --> 04:49.320
It is almost time.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.500
The men— are they ready?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.110
Yes, sir.

04:53.110 --> 04:54.830
Are they afraid?

04:54.830 --> 04:59.880
I don't know, sir, but some of them are praying.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.790
It's good if they are afraid.

05:02.830 --> 05:06.200
It means they will fight bravely.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.540
Have you heard from my father yet, sir?

05:08.580 --> 05:11.820
I thought he was supposed to be meeting us here.

05:11.820 --> 05:13.830
Don't worry, Laurent.

05:13.830 --> 05:16.010
He will be here.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.900
Yes, sir.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.650
Colonel Dubaku is dead.

05:26.690 --> 05:27.490
Are you certain?

05:27.530 --> 05:29.340
The dose I administered was catastrophic.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.530
His son just asked me about him.

05:31.530 --> 05:36.490
He must never know about this,
or about his father's cowardice.

05:36.490 --> 05:37.170
He won't.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.450
Then nothing will stand in our way, Udo.

05:39.490 --> 05:42.390
But hurry. The attack window is narrowing.

05:42.390 --> 05:44.370
The timing must be precise.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.430
–Clear!
–Yes, sir.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.560
Clear.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.340
One more time at 360.

05:55.340 --> 05:57.360
clear.

05:58.230 --> 06:00.090
Nothing.

06:00.310 --> 06:03.200
Going again, doctor?

06:05.220 --> 06:05.960
no.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.850
That's it, everybody. I'm calling it.

06:07.890 --> 06:10.350
Time of death: 6:06 P.M.

06:10.350 --> 06:11.650
Dr Stahl, what's going on?

06:11.690 --> 06:12.820
A massive heart attack.

06:12.860 --> 06:14.540
You said that he was stable,
that he was going to be okay.

06:14.580 --> 06:15.470
So, what happened?

06:15.510 --> 06:16.610
I'm not sure.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.140
Maybe a preexisting condition.

06:18.180 --> 06:21.770
The autopsy will tell us. Excuse me.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.980
The wide extent of the corruption
requires a coordinated approach.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.600
We know the government's been compromised.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.620
We just don't know at what level.

06:31.660 --> 06:34.870
Presently, Chloe O'Brian is vetting
the names department by department.

06:34.910 --> 06:38.570
I'm prioritizing secret service, so the
president is secured as soon as possible.

06:38.610 --> 06:40.800
Team leaders will then receive their assignments—

06:40.840 --> 06:42.570
defense, treasury, state, et cetera—

06:42.610 --> 06:46.750
and make their arrests
contemporaneously across the district.

06:51.230 --> 06:52.850
–O'Brian.
–Chloe, it's Jack.

06:52.890 --> 06:55.790
Have the names from Dubaku's database
been handed over to the arrest teams yet?

06:55.830 --> 06:56.560
Not yet.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.380
Okay, listen to me.

06:57.420 --> 07:00.010
I've just learned that Juma's
operatives are planning another attack.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.810
Jack, they're telling us here it's over.

07:01.850 --> 07:02.660
That's wrong.

07:02.700 --> 07:03.990
Tony's my source on the intel.

07:04.030 --> 07:05.110
Do you know what the target is?

07:05.150 --> 07:06.830
Only that it's high value, high casualty,

07:06.870 --> 07:08.850
and that it's happening now,
which is why I need your help.

07:08.890 --> 07:11.720
There's a man on the list, a Ryan Burnett.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.360
He's senator Mayer's chief of staff.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.190
Mayer?

07:14.190 --> 07:16.690
Isn't he the guy who grilled you this
morning at the senate subcommittee hearing?

07:16.730 --> 07:18.810
Yeah, but the senator's not
implicated in the conspiracy.

07:18.850 --> 07:22.540
But Burnett has been providing support
for Juma and Dubaku all along.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.660
Chloe, I need you to delete
his name from the list.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.530
What? Why?

07:26.530 --> 07:28.590
If the FBI start to move in
on him, he'll lawyer up,

07:28.630 --> 07:30.730
and no one will get the information on time.

07:30.770 --> 07:32.000
Where is he now?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.010
He's at the white house with the senator.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.350
They've got a meeting with the president.

07:34.390 --> 07:36.300
I'm on my way there now to be debriefed by bill.

07:36.340 --> 07:37.670
I'll take care of him then.

07:37.710 --> 07:41.110
Jack, you don't expect to interrogate
a suspect in the white house?

07:41.150 --> 07:41.990
Let me handle that.

07:42.030 --> 07:43.750
Chloe, just get his name deleted from the list.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.850
I'll get back to you.

07:45.850 --> 07:48.430
She's in.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.100
How close are we?

08:28.100 --> 08:29.020
Close.

08:29.020 --> 08:30.190
Is there anything I can do to help?

08:30.230 --> 08:32.520
I'm just cycling through the
last layer of data now.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.429
You know, it might be quicker

08:33.470 --> 08:37.200
if you send the subsets to my station one by one.

08:37.200 --> 08:37.990
Good idea.

08:37.990 --> 08:41.751
And then that way I can get
to work on distributing them.

08:42.740 --> 08:45.780
–Okay, then.
–Thank you.

09:00.070 --> 09:03.110
Listen, Jack, maybe you should reconsider.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.480
Reconsider what?

09:05.480 --> 09:08.460
Taking bill into your confidence.

09:08.460 --> 09:13.230
Look, I mean, he's been a part of
this operation since the get-go.

09:13.230 --> 09:15.160
I don't know what it's going to
take to get Burnett to talk.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.750
If I have to use extreme measures…

09:17.750 --> 09:20.910
I don't get it. What, you
don't think he'll go there?

09:20.950 --> 09:23.100
I'm driving off a cliff here, Tony.

09:23.140 --> 09:26.990
I don't need to put bill in the passenger seat.

09:26.990 --> 09:30.010
All right, then, fine. I'll go with you.

09:30.010 --> 09:31.160
You're a wanted felon.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.590
You wouldn't get past the first checkpoint.

09:33.630 --> 09:35.850
Besides, with all of the government
agencies still compromised,

09:35.890 --> 09:40.030
it might be up to you to stop the attack.

09:42.060 --> 09:44.920
See you on the other side.

09:52.790 --> 09:53.850
Yes?

09:53.850 --> 09:55.390
Can you extend the attack window?

09:55.430 --> 09:58.070
Not without risking the entire operation.

09:58.110 --> 09:58.960
Why?

09:58.960 --> 10:00.580
There's been a complication.

10:00.620 --> 10:03.450
I may be stuck here longer than I anticipated.

10:03.490 --> 10:05.580
I'll call you back.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.680
Mr Kanin.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.680
Ryan Burnett, senator Mayer's chief of staff.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.140
We've spoken on the phone.

10:10.180 --> 10:12.080
Many times. It's good to finally meet you.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.470
Likewise. The senator's inside. Right this way.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.920
Senator?

10:23.320 --> 10:26.320
Well, senator, I see you've found the bar.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.250
Mind if I join you?

10:31.370 --> 10:32.980
Something I never knew.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.990
If it ain't from Kentucky,
you can't call it bourbon.

10:36.030 --> 10:38.330
Spare me the southern gentleman routine, Ethan.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.480
The president didn't call me up
here at the ass-end of the day

10:40.520 --> 10:43.900
to drink her booze and flip
through a briefing book.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.130
I thought it might be
helpful, before your meeting,

10:46.170 --> 10:48.640
to bring you up to speed on the
events of the last ten hours.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.860
Okay.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.980
I'm up to speed.

10:55.020 --> 11:00.140
Senator, surely you have some
reaction to what you just read.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.220
Damn right I have a reaction.

11:02.220 --> 11:04.830
I want to know what all this
has to do with Jack Bauer.

11:04.870 --> 11:07.090
I mean, that's the reason I'm here, right?

11:07.130 --> 11:10.400
Without Mr Bauer, we would never
have uncovered the conspiracy

11:10.440 --> 11:13.220
in the first place nor the people behind it.

11:13.260 --> 11:15.820
His efforts, in conjunction
with those of the FBI,

11:15.860 --> 11:19.840
are largely responsible for the arrests
being made right now across the district.

11:19.880 --> 11:24.620
You're not saying that he's
acting in an official capacity?

11:24.620 --> 11:26.690
I don't have to tell you how this looks, Ethan.

11:26.730 --> 11:31.020
Colluding with a rogue operative
from a disbanded agency.

11:31.020 --> 11:32.370
I'm sorry you see it that way.

11:32.410 --> 11:33.870
How else am I supposed to see it?

11:33.910 --> 11:37.700
The way the president does— that
Jack Bauer saved lives today,

11:37.740 --> 11:42.800
plain and simple, including her husband's.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.840
Look, senator, I know this isn't easy for you.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.370
The public battle you've
waged against detainee abuse

11:48.410 --> 11:49.710
and human rights violations…

11:49.750 --> 11:54.500
are you seriously asking me to
look the other way on this?

11:54.500 --> 11:57.310
I have been after this son of a bitch for years.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.000
He's a thug, Ethan.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.410
He's exhibit “A”.

12:05.650 --> 12:08.630
The president is prepared to reverse policy

12:08.630 --> 12:12.140
and support your amendment to the war crimes act.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.470
In exchange for what exactly?

12:14.470 --> 12:15.850
The hearings.

12:15.850 --> 12:18.110
Declare a recess till after the holidays

12:18.150 --> 12:22.210
and then quietly let Mr Bauer's subpoena expire.

12:22.210 --> 12:23.650
And if I refuse to go along?

12:23.690 --> 12:26.600
The president is prepared to
invoke executive privilege.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.970
Executive privilege— meaning what exactly?

12:29.010 --> 12:33.150
Well, that's for the president to decide.

12:33.150 --> 12:35.860
Are you talking about a pardon?

12:35.860 --> 12:37.650
I wouldn't rule it out.

12:37.650 --> 12:39.550
Well, if that's how the
president wants to play it,

12:39.590 --> 12:44.050
you can tell her she just
walked into a street fight.

12:44.050 --> 12:46.940
You can tell her yourself.

12:58.620 --> 12:59.970
–Jack.
–Hi, bill.

12:59.970 --> 13:03.110
You got here sooner than I expected.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.560
Jack.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.890
Put down your weapon now!

13:09.670 --> 13:12.840
Step away from the desk!

13:12.840 --> 13:14.190
Take a seat.

13:14.190 --> 13:15.730
Sit down, bill!

13:15.730 --> 13:17.670
Okay, okay, I'm sitting.

13:17.670 --> 13:18.830
Now, what's this all about?

13:18.870 --> 13:20.220
–Where is Ryan Burnett?
–What?

13:20.260 --> 13:22.250
Senator Mayer's chief of staff— where is he?

13:22.290 --> 13:25.390
I'm not saying anything until you
tell me what the hell's going on.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.230
Tony doubled back to one of his contacts,

13:27.270 --> 13:29.320
who gave him information of a second attack.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.930
It's going to take place here
in Washington within the hour.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.420
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.

13:33.460 --> 13:35.280
Burnett's been supporting them all along.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.820
He knows where the attack's going to take place,

13:36.860 --> 13:41.030
so you can either tell me where
he is or I will find him myself.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.230
Jack, I can't.

13:43.230 --> 13:47.300
Fine, put your hands behind your back now.

13:48.390 --> 13:49.870
How good is the intel?

13:49.870 --> 13:51.780
Good enough for me to need to talk to him.

13:51.820 --> 13:54.370
Don't you move.

13:54.370 --> 13:57.200
Jack, let me have him arrested.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.650
There are other ways to deal with this.

13:58.690 --> 14:00.110
The attack window's open.

14:00.150 --> 14:03.000
We're out of time.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.660
Jack, listen to me.

14:05.660 --> 14:08.540
I spoke to the president on your behalf.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.510
She's going to intervene with senator Mayer,

14:10.550 --> 14:13.070
stop the hearings.

14:13.070 --> 14:14.640
You can get your life back.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.610
You do this, you're throwing it all away.

14:16.650 --> 14:19.310
I wish I thought there was another option.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.660
Let me help you at least, Jack.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.520
Y-you don't have to do this alone.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.480
Yes, I do.

14:28.610 --> 14:31.140
It's the only way I can make
sure to keep you out of this.

14:31.180 --> 14:32.910
–Jack.
–Bill, I'm sorry.

14:32.910 --> 14:37.050
Jack, w-w-wait! Jack!

14:38.020 --> 14:39.530
It's all right.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.130
don't fight it.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.010
–this is moss.
–Larry, it's me.

15:16.050 --> 15:18.290
Dubaku's dead.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.600
I thought the doctors said he was stabilized.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.330
What happened?

15:21.370 --> 15:25.540
Officially, they're characterizing that it
was a coronary brought on by systemic shock.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.060
Sounds like you don't believe it.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.850
I did a follow-up with the hospital admin.

15:28.890 --> 15:31.690
She confirmed that there was an eight-member
team on duty when Dubaku flatlined.

15:31.730 --> 15:32.690
Yeah?

15:32.690 --> 15:36.170
There was a ninth man in the ICU just
before the code was called— an orderly.

15:36.210 --> 15:38.810
I ran back the tapes on the ward
and that's when I spotted him.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.370
The thing is: I've asked around and
nobody seems to know who he is.

15:41.410 --> 15:44.360
Renee, wait, a-are you saying
you think Dubaku was murdered?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.770
I'm saying that there was an
unidentified man in with Dubaku just

15:46.810 --> 15:50.060
before he went into cardiac arrest.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.340
What does the admin say?

15:51.380 --> 15:52.830
She says that they often use floaters—

15:52.870 --> 15:55.900
personnel from other area hospitals
filling in from time to time.

15:55.940 --> 15:59.140
Said it's not uncommon for the regular
staff not to know who they are.

15:59.180 --> 16:00.430
She's double-checking with payroll now.

16:00.470 --> 16:02.740
Right, so there's your answer.

16:02.740 --> 16:03.800
Still it seems odd.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.180
I mean, what if Dubaku knew something
and they needed to shut him up?

16:08.220 --> 16:10.490
Is this Bauer's theory, too?

16:10.490 --> 16:13.710
Jack's not even here and, you know,
I resent that implication, Larry.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.660
–What implication is that? -That
I'm not the one calling the shots.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.180
This has been my investigation
from the beginning,

16:17.220 --> 16:18.640
not Jack Bauer's.

16:18.640 --> 16:22.920
I was just asking a question.
I wasn't implying anything.

16:25.740 --> 16:27.090
You there?

16:27.090 --> 16:29.380
I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little
sensitive on the subject.

16:29.420 --> 16:33.290
Look, everything we needed from Dubaku, we got.

16:33.290 --> 16:36.050
Names and bank accounts of every
corrupt official on his payroll.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.300
Teams are in the field as we speak.

16:38.340 --> 16:39.550
So you're saying you want me to come in.

16:39.590 --> 16:41.090
We need you back in the office sooner than later

16:41.130 --> 16:44.240
to help process all these arrests.

16:44.240 --> 16:47.180
Larry, look, I've got security searching
the hospital a nd reviewing more video.

16:47.220 --> 16:48.810
So, what, you want to follow that up first?

16:48.850 --> 16:50.660
Fine, call me when you clear it.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.590
I will. Thanks, Larry.

16:52.590 --> 16:53.850
Excuse me, agent walker?

16:53.890 --> 16:55.700
That orderly you were looking for—

16:55.740 --> 16:58.030
one of our parking lot cameras
picked him up getting into his car.

16:58.070 --> 16:59.800
–When?
–Uh, about 15 minutes ago.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.320
I've got a screen grab of his license plate.

17:05.069 --> 17:06.690
Thank you.

17:08.930 --> 17:12.626
This is agent walker. Put me
through to our DMV contact.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.160
Are you busy?

17:19.160 --> 17:22.510
I'm just reformatting the server,
so, yeah, I guess I am busy. W?

17:22.550 --> 17:25.160
Well, I was cross-referencing
Dubaku's offshore accounts

17:25.200 --> 17:27.869
and I came across an orphaned header fragment.

17:27.910 --> 17:30.930
–What are you talking about?
–Take a look.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.500
Okay, see, there, right there, right there.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.840
It's a remnant file header.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.830
It's probably just a phantom data string.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.130
No, it isn't.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.630
I ran a systems analysis.

17:44.670 --> 17:45.680
The coding is not random.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.970
It can be traced back to one of the accounts.

17:48.010 --> 17:51.550
Also, it looks like a name
was deleted from the list.

17:51.550 --> 17:53.050
why don't I run a recovery program?

17:53.090 --> 17:55.490
Well, you're very busy with
the reformatting and all,

17:55.530 --> 17:59.600
so why don't I just upload it to my
station and take care of it there?

17:59.640 --> 18:02.150
Well, that's okay, I can do it faster.

18:02.150 --> 18:03.660
No offense.

18:03.660 --> 18:08.610
I'll let you know if I retrieve anything.

18:09.110 --> 18:11.230
Sure.

18:11.230 --> 18:14.160
–Thanks.
–Thank you.

18:24.180 --> 18:25.030
yeah.

18:25.030 --> 18:27.250
Have you gotten to Burnett yet?

18:27.250 --> 18:29.390
Working on it. Making my
way over to the west wing.

18:29.430 --> 18:32.150
Someone here has figured out that a name
has been deleted from the database.

18:32.190 --> 18:33.800
I don't know how much longer I can hold her off.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.040
Do they know it was Burnett?

18:35.080 --> 18:36.760
No, but it's just a matter of time.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.400
Okay, I'll get back to you.

18:40.730 --> 18:42.710
Great.

18:42.710 --> 18:45.670
Senator, I'll head back to
the hill and get with sandy.

18:45.710 --> 18:48.000
We should have a press release drafted
by the time you finish your meeting.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.050
I'm also going to need a sit-down
with your friend Hauser at the post.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.840
Off the record, I assume.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.300
We've got to make pardoning Jack Bauer

18:54.340 --> 18:58.080
as politically toxic for
the president as possible.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.650
She's a woman in a highly emotional state.

19:00.690 --> 19:01.990
Her husband's been shot.

19:02.030 --> 19:03.400
You suggesting her judgment's impaired?

19:03.440 --> 19:06.800
I'm suggesting that a case could be made.

19:06.800 --> 19:07.870
excuse me, senator.

19:07.910 --> 19:10.000
President Taylor is ready to see you now.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.500
Go ahead, senator. I'll get this to the AG,

19:11.540 --> 19:14.130
tell him you want the option to go ahead
with the hearings tomorrow as scheduled.

19:14.170 --> 19:16.130
Thanks, Ryan.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.330
Yes?

19:25.330 --> 19:26.140
It's Burnett.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.370
You took care of the problem?

19:27.410 --> 19:28.220
I'm leaving now.

19:28.260 --> 19:32.460
Good, then we rendezvous
at 2130 hours, as planned.

19:32.460 --> 19:34.670
I'll be there.

19:46.780 --> 19:50.490
Excuse me, I'll be out of
here in just one second.

19:51.920 --> 19:58.380
You and I……we're going to have a talk.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.580
We've got a command post set up at EEOB,

20:11.580 --> 20:13.690
and we'll brief CIA and diplomatic security,

20:13.730 --> 20:17.160
but not until after the first sweep of arrests.

20:17.590 --> 20:19.670
Look, nobody is going anywhere, Phil.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.280
We've dropped a net on the city.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.240
And I'll let you know as soon as that happens.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.690
All right.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.130
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I
need you to listen to something.

20:27.170 --> 20:29.210
–May I?
–Yeah, that's fine.

20:29.210 --> 20:31.840
She's supposed to be this
whiz-bang systems analyst,

20:31.880 --> 20:33.420
which is actually what tipped
me off in the first place.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.990
–Her demeanor is so bizarre…
–W-w-whoa, Janis, Janis, slow down.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.830
–Who are you talking about?
–Chloe O'Brian.

20:37.870 --> 20:41.340
I ran a systems check on her work, and it
turns out there's evidence of file tampering.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.950
Plus she's been scrambling all
her out-of-office phone calls,

20:43.990 --> 20:47.640
so I had operations archive her cellular traffic.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.960
I did a work-around.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.780
Listen.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.410
Have you gotten to Burnett yet?

20:52.450 --> 20:53.520
Working on it.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.980
Making my way over to the west wing.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.720
Someone here has figured out that a name
has been deleted from the database.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.270
Longer I can hold her off.

20:59.310 --> 21:00.580
Do they know it was Burnett?

21:00.620 --> 21:02.620
No, but it's just a matter of time.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.220
Okay, I'll get back to you.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.710
Becker.

21:10.710 --> 21:14.110
In the conference room. I
want Chloe O'Brian detained.

21:14.150 --> 21:16.460
And get her off that server.

21:33.070 --> 21:34.588
Get me the white house.

21:39.180 --> 21:44.820
Let me just remind you, madam president, you
supported the effort to ban abuse and torture.

21:44.860 --> 21:48.170
You campaigned to reform
the intelligence agencies.

21:48.210 --> 21:53.280
These past ten hours, senator, things haven't
appeared as black and white as they once did.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.040
Well, there's nothing
gray about Jack Bauer.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.258
The man has committed atrocities.

21:58.310 --> 22:00.640
Prisoners have died in his custody.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.880
Bauer has served under the aegis
of three presidents, not just me.

22:04.920 --> 22:09.890
Is it any more lawful or any less repugnant
if it's authorized at the highest level?

22:09.930 --> 22:12.910
A state of war is not a blank check
for the president or for anyone.

22:12.950 --> 22:14.730
Oh, don't lecture me, senator.

22:14.770 --> 22:18.070
I am well aware of
the limits of my power.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.830
Due respect, madam president…
your power is great.

22:22.050 --> 22:25.770
Just be careful that you use
it to send the right message.

22:25.810 --> 22:30.490
All I'm asking you to do is
excuse Mr Bauer as a witness.

22:30.590 --> 22:31.940
It's not a message.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.480
It is an expression of gratitude
for what he's done today.

22:35.520 --> 22:40.850
You're asking me to excuse
him as a target of the investigation.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.630
And the message is clear.

22:43.740 --> 22:47.680
Under certain circumstances, you
believe his methods are acceptable.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.766
Some would argue that they are.

22:49.830 --> 22:51.850
And they would be wrong.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.950
Under any military or moral standard.

22:55.330 --> 22:59.026
America has been down this
road before, madam president.

22:59.070 --> 23:01.480
You yourself called it a national tragedy.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.400
It was a tragedy.

23:03.510 --> 23:05.010
I still believe that.

23:05.110 --> 23:11.578
Pardon Jack Bauer, and you're telling every
interrogator in the field
that it's open season again.

23:13.910 --> 23:15.770
I'm sorry to interrupt, madam president.

23:15.810 --> 23:18.846
There's an urgent call
from Larry moss at FBI.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.350
–Put him through.
–Yes, sir.

23:24.390 --> 23:26.106
Agent moss is on the line.

23:26.190 --> 23:27.590
Agent moss, this is Ethan Kanin.

23:27.630 --> 23:29.050
You're on speaker with the president.

23:29.090 --> 23:31.450
Madam president, forgive me for
coming directly to the point.

23:31.490 --> 23:33.950
You have a meeting this
evening with senator Mayer?

23:33.990 --> 23:35.890
In fact, I do. I'm with him right now.

23:35.930 --> 23:41.320
Did the senator's chief of staff, Ryan
Burnett, accompany the
senator to the white house?

23:41.360 --> 23:42.850
Yes, he did, agent
moss— why?

23:42.890 --> 23:50.084
I have reason to believe
that Jack Bauer is carrying
out an off-book interrogation
of Mr Burnett as we speak.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.200
I can pull the trigger 128 more
times before this battery dies.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.480
I'm telling you, I don't know
anything about an attack.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.430
Stop lying to me.

24:02.470 --> 24:03.394
I'm not lying.

24:03.430 --> 24:04.400
What's the target?

24:04.440 --> 24:05.630
I can't tell you what I don't know.

24:05.670 --> 24:08.280
Mr Burnett, you are a
traitor and a terrorist.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.560
I'm not. I love my country.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.900
that was 1,200 volts of current.

24:15.940 --> 24:18.320
Now, when I eject this cartridge,

24:18.660 --> 24:24.850
I access the drive stun mode, upping the
voltage 40 times when directly administered.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.550
All you need to do is talk to me.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.830
Mr Burnett, it's really simple.

24:28.870 --> 24:31.140
Just tell me what the target
is, and this will be all over.

24:31.180 --> 24:34.410
I promise. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:34.450 --> 24:35.720
This is your last chance.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.420
If I knew, I would tell you, I swear it.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.010
What do you want me to say?

24:40.050 --> 24:43.218
Just… just tell me what
to say, and I'll say it.

24:46.660 --> 24:48.770
don't you even try and
play that game with me.

24:48.810 --> 24:51.190
Mr Burnett, I've been doing this a long
time, and I can tell the difference,

24:51.230 --> 24:55.470
especially when a man is
under duress, if he's got
information that I need or
if I'm just wasting my time.

24:55.510 --> 24:59.150
And I promise you, I
am not wasting my time.

25:01.270 --> 25:03.560
the next jolt is gonna
be in your throat.

25:03.600 --> 25:08.420
Anything above your neck runs the risk
of a complete neuromuscular shutdown.

25:08.460 --> 25:11.600
That means you run the
risk of becoming paralyzed.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.370
No, please.

25:13.460 --> 25:16.480
Mr Burnett, you built the
entire federal case against me.

25:16.520 --> 25:21.550
You of all people should know how far I am
willing to go to stop this attack from happening.

25:21.590 --> 25:23.870
So, I'm gonna ask you one last time.

25:23.910 --> 25:25.620
Where is the target⁈

25:26.240 --> 25:30.410
I… Okay, okay, okay.

25:30.490 --> 25:31.750
I'm listening.

25:31.850 --> 25:33.450
Soldiers.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.400
–How many?
–A unit.

25:35.430 --> 25:37.210
Juma's presidential guard.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.350
When?

25:38.450 --> 25:40.200
It already started.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.030
Where? Where⁈

25:42.100 --> 25:45.040
Mr Bauer, this is president Taylor.

25:45.650 --> 25:46.610
Where is the target?

25:46.650 --> 25:47.950
–Mr Bauer…
–Wher!

25:48.060 --> 25:52.310
Mr Bauer, I am ordering
you to answer this page.

25:52.430 --> 25:53.820
Mr Bauer, do you hear me?

25:53.860 --> 25:55.390
Damn it!

25:56.790 --> 25:59.166
Madam president, this is Jack Bauer.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.490
I don't know what you've heard
so far, but this thing is not over.

26:01.530 --> 26:04.270
There is another terrorist attack
going to take place within minutes.

26:04.310 --> 26:06.690
There will be no discussion
until you unlock this door.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.480
Madam president, the
attack window is open.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.972
Juma's men are moving.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.510
What you're doing is
against the law, Mr Bauer.

26:12.550 --> 26:17.620
I am your commander in chief, and
I am ordering you to stand down.

26:21.750 --> 26:22.930
how much longer, sergeant?

26:22.970 --> 26:24.090
Good to go, ma'am.

26:24.130 --> 26:25.300
Do it.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.520
Where's the target?

26:26.560 --> 26:27.900
Where is the target⁈

26:27.990 --> 26:29.250
Where is… ⁈

26:32.390 --> 26:34.420
I had him!

26:39.800 --> 26:40.470
Man down.

26:40.580 --> 26:43.022
EMTs to the visiting dignitary suite.

26:47.460 --> 26:48.650
You're done, Bauer.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.160
You're finished.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.010
He was talking.

26:52.100 --> 26:55.570
Whatever's going to happen is happening
now, and it's on your conscience.

26:55.610 --> 26:59.174
My conscience has a lot less
to answer for than yours.

27:05.490 --> 27:09.270
Mr Bauer, you say an attack is imminent.

27:09.470 --> 27:11.054
My source intel is good.

27:11.090 --> 27:12.790
Who is your source?

27:12.890 --> 27:14.260
I'd rather not say.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.390
The name, Mr Bauer.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.760
Tony Almeida.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.630
Tony Almeida— the
man's a fugitive.

27:23.670 --> 27:26.920
Without Tony Almeida, we would
never have recovered the CIP device.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.960
Madam president, I don't care if his
source is the blessed virgin Mary.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.230
Nothing justifies what
went on in this room.

27:33.270 --> 27:35.220
Even if he's right, Blaine?

27:35.260 --> 27:37.702
Even if it means we could save lives?

27:38.410 --> 27:41.380
Look at that, and tell
me it's not barbarism.

27:41.670 --> 27:43.700
Is that something you can live with?

27:43.740 --> 27:47.830
Earlier today, madam president, two
airplanes were brought down.

27:47.870 --> 27:49.820
Is that something you can live with?

27:49.860 --> 27:51.708
You're reprehensible, Bauer.

27:51.740 --> 27:53.430
And you, sir, are weak!

27:53.490 --> 27:57.582
Unwilling and unable to look
evil in the eye and deal with it.

27:57.890 --> 28:00.190
Ethan, step out for a second.

28:07.430 --> 28:10.202
Suddenly, it's not so hypothetical, is it?

28:10.890 --> 28:13.940
In your opinion, is Bauer's
intelligence actionable?

28:13.980 --> 28:19.854
If Bauer says there's going to be an attack, my
belief is, there's going to be an attack.

28:22.820 --> 28:26.000
Torture was originally intended
to force false confessions.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.060
Now we use it to try and find the truth.

28:29.550 --> 28:32.340
These people murdered
your son, madam president.

28:32.380 --> 28:34.310
They attempted to murder your husband.

28:34.350 --> 28:36.580
They will stop at nothing.

28:49.780 --> 28:51.694
Sergeant, take Mr Bauer away.

28:51.710 --> 28:53.360
He's under arrest.

28:58.220 --> 28:59.360
You should have come to me.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.050
You should have presented your case.

29:01.090 --> 29:02.670
We didn't have time.

29:02.860 --> 29:06.160
And would it really have
made a difference, ma'am?

29:15.240 --> 29:18.210
Madam president… you're
doing the right thing.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.480
271 dead already.

29:19.690 --> 29:22.858
I wish to God it felt
more like the right thing.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.080
Ethan, raise the threat levels.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.780
Tell homeland they have until 7:00
come with a response scenario.

29:27.820 --> 29:29.700
And get Tim down here.

29:29.740 --> 29:33.300
Also, I want to talk
to Mr Burnett myself.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.220
Let me do that.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.900
I know the man.

29:37.990 --> 29:40.610
Apparently, you don't.

29:57.340 --> 29:58.920
Got it.

29:59.870 --> 30:04.630
Tim, I understand the threat
level has been raised, but
only for first responders and federal agents.

30:04.670 --> 30:08.950
There's a concern that mass
evacuation by the public
could hamper efforts to thwart
an attack when it comes.

30:08.990 --> 30:10.820
What about the airspace over Washington?

30:10.860 --> 30:11.740
Restricted.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.430
Military flyovers are commencing.

30:13.470 --> 30:18.540
DOD has recommended that
we deploy mobile teams to
sweep the area for radioactive
and biological signatures.

30:18.580 --> 30:21.160
I'll call Phillip at the
Pentagon and push it through.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.650
What about NSA?

30:22.710 --> 30:26.020
There's elevated anti-American
chatter coming from the usual web sites

30:26.060 --> 30:28.800
and telephone traffic, but
nothing specific to the attack.

30:28.840 --> 30:29.910
Thank you, Tim.

30:29.980 --> 30:31.260
I'll see you upstairs in 15 minutes.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.400
Yes, ma'am.

30:32.970 --> 30:36.770
Which means our best source of intelligence
is still right here under our noses.

30:36.810 --> 30:40.030
You realize we're gonna have to
offer this bastard a free pass.

30:40.070 --> 30:42.990
With coercive measures off
the table, it's our only option.

30:43.030 --> 30:46.590
Bauer's going to prison, and
a traitor walks.

30:46.870 --> 30:49.250
What's wrong with this picture?

30:51.340 --> 30:53.584
I need a minute with the prisoner.

30:55.930 --> 31:03.240
Mr Burnett, you will be charged with treason under
title 18, section 2381, of
the United States code.

31:03.280 --> 31:07.890
Giving aid and comfort to the enemy and
directly causing the death of American citizens.

31:07.930 --> 31:10.320
Do you understand?

31:12.420 --> 31:15.280
Surely, you have something
to say for yourself.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.770
I demand my right to counsel.

31:18.490 --> 31:24.628
You'll have your counsel, Mr Burnett, but
first, you're going to tell
me everything you know.

31:25.580 --> 31:26.850
Not in this lifetime.

31:26.890 --> 31:28.012
What did you say?

31:28.080 --> 31:30.110
I said, not in this lifetime.

31:30.150 --> 31:33.516
Don't be so quick to make
up your mind, Mr Burnett.

31:37.610 --> 31:43.240
In exchange for information which stops
or significantly mitigates this attack,

31:43.420 --> 31:48.040
the president is prepared to grant
you full immunity from prosecution.

31:48.260 --> 31:49.860
I'm sorry.

31:49.950 --> 31:50.970
I can't help you.

31:51.010 --> 31:54.640
If you and your family are
being threatened in any way…

31:56.500 --> 31:59.800
do you realize what the
president is offering you?

32:01.120 --> 32:04.460
Treason is a capital offense, Mr Burnett.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.760
If you don't cooperate
with us right now,

32:06.800 --> 32:11.990
I will make it my personal mission to see that
you pay the ultimate price for your crimes.

32:12.030 --> 32:14.802
I won't condone
torture, but in your case,

32:14.810 --> 32:17.912
I would have no problem
with the death penalty.

32:19.710 --> 32:21.660
Where's my lawyer?

33:15.740 --> 33:16.480
Walker.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.380
It's me. That situation at
the hospital you told me about?

33:19.420 --> 33:20.810
Yeah, I'm on it, Larry.

33:20.850 --> 33:23.470
I traced a license plate
to an import/export firm.

33:23.510 --> 33:24.300
Tell me.

33:24.350 --> 33:26.970
The orderly I mentioned— he just
joined up with about a dozen soldiers.

33:27.010 --> 33:28.594
Africans. Heavily armed.

33:28.620 --> 33:29.544
Where are you?

33:29.560 --> 33:32.340
44543 Lambourne
marina, near Johnson park.

33:32.390 --> 33:34.120
I'm in the warehouse basement.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.810
Renee, we have intel on another
attack by Juma's people.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.740
It's happening in
DC., Sometime after 1900 hours.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.410
This is it, Larry. No question.

33:41.450 --> 33:42.650
All right, listen, sit tight.

33:42.690 --> 33:45.010
–I'm on my way with back.
–Make it quick.

33:45.050 --> 33:47.110
Janis, scramble a chopper.

33:47.170 --> 33:48.310
On the roof in two minutes.

33:48.350 --> 33:49.160
Okay.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.590
–But also…
–Janis, just do it.

33:53.130 --> 33:54.384
This is Larry moss.

33:54.620 --> 33:56.490
Put me through to metro police.

33:56.530 --> 33:58.270
Charters, turner—
with me.

34:03.430 --> 34:06.720
General, there is no sign of my father.

34:07.070 --> 34:08.880
I just spoke with him.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.520
Unfortunately he won't
be able to join us.

34:11.560 --> 34:12.449
Why not?

34:12.620 --> 34:18.230
Because he got delayed in his attempt to
secure safe passage for us from the country.

34:18.280 --> 34:21.420
Then, sir, let me take his
place on the assault team.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.429
Spoken like a true Dubaku, Laurent.

34:24.590 --> 34:26.679
But you are also my only
reconnaissance officer.

34:26.719 --> 34:30.000
–But, general…
–no, I need you on the perimeter
to provide intelligence

34:30.040 --> 34:34.000
and also to disrupt whatever
rescue operations there may be.

34:34.350 --> 34:35.730
Understood?

34:37.239 --> 34:38.620
Understood, sir.

34:39.090 --> 34:41.004
Make your final preparations.

34:41.170 --> 34:42.780
It is time for us to go.

34:42.850 --> 34:44.170
Yes, sir.

34:50.139 --> 34:50.969
yeah?

34:51.030 --> 34:52.719
Larry, hurry, they're moving out.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.110
We're ten minutes away.

34:54.150 --> 34:56.750
Is it possible that Juma
himself is leading this attack?

34:56.790 --> 34:58.560
Juma? Why do you say that?

34:58.620 --> 35:01.390
I know it sounds crazy, but
I swear that I just saw him.

35:01.430 --> 35:02.450
What⁈Here⁈

35:02.500 --> 35:03.358
Are you sure?

35:03.360 --> 35:05.472
Unless he has an identical twin.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.980
All right, I'll alert homeland.

35:07.020 --> 35:08.330
Good work.

35:08.380 --> 35:09.830
Any idea what the next target is?

35:09.870 --> 35:10.900
Negative.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.980
See if you get a fix on
that. But, listen, don't take any chances.

35:14.020 --> 35:15.180
All right?

35:15.240 --> 35:16.680
I won't.

37:16.610 --> 37:17.820
Okay, thank you.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.060
Sir.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.640
You should have an
EMT take a look at you.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.730
I'm fine.

37:22.820 --> 37:23.730
Is Bauer in custody?

37:23.770 --> 37:25.230
Yes, sir. He's in holding.

37:25.270 --> 37:26.540
That'll be all.

37:36.450 --> 37:37.580
Tony, it's bill.

37:37.640 --> 37:38.180
Bill.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.590
Jack's under arrest. They've got him
locked down in a holding cell here.

37:40.630 --> 37:42.840
–Listen to me, bill…
–no, you listen.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.350
We still don't know where
this attack's taking place.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.410
Burnett didn't break?

37:46.450 --> 37:49.560
No. They stopped Jack before
he could get the information.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.730
And Burnett didn't go for
the president's immunity deal.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.800
You were the one who
brought Jack the intel, right?

37:54.840 --> 37:55.900
That's right.

37:55.980 --> 37:57.260
How real is it?

37:57.310 --> 37:58.300
Very.

37:58.340 --> 38:00.180
Who was your contact?

38:00.210 --> 38:02.790
It was a guy in Emerson's crew
with a direct line to Juma.

38:02.830 --> 38:04.550
Any chance we get
another crack at this guy?

38:04.590 --> 38:06.760
That's highly unlikely, to say the least.

38:06.800 --> 38:09.110
What are you telling me, he's dead?

38:10.250 --> 38:11.560
That's right?

38:12.620 --> 38:14.520
I wish to God you'd
brought me in on this.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.690
Jack didn't want to put
you in that position.

38:16.730 --> 38:18.840
For what it's worth, he was
trying to protect you, bill.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.050
Did you have a fallback plan, at least?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.200
Immunity for Burnett was the fallback.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.400
That's it? Nothing else?

38:26.240 --> 38:28.470
No. Nothing.

38:32.930 --> 38:34.800
I keep trying Renee, and I
keep getting her voice mail.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
What the hell's going on?

38:35.880 --> 38:37.170
There's something wrong with her phone.

38:37.210 --> 38:39.460
What do you mean, something's wrong? I
just spoke to her five minutes ago.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.870
Can you triangulate her position?

38:40.910 --> 38:41.990
I can't.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.030
Why not?

38:43.170 --> 38:44.400
There's no signal.

38:44.500 --> 38:48.300
Either the battery's dead, or
her cell got damaged somehow.

38:48.340 --> 38:49.660
All right, keep trying.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.140
Get back to me when you know something.

38:51.180 --> 38:52.460
Okay.

39:29.160 --> 39:33.450
From our location it is approximately
100 meters to the entrance.

39:33.800 --> 39:40.140
From this point forward, we maintain
radio silence until the target is secure.

39:41.050 --> 39:42.480
Understood?

39:42.530 --> 39:43.900
Yes, sir.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.560
You all have your assignments.

39:52.950 --> 39:54.910
May God be with us.

40:18.110 --> 40:20.920
Laurent, take your position.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.340
Yes, sir.
