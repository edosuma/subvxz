Here. Try this screen.

02:25.378 --> 02:28.347
Concentrate on this area over here.
Right there.

02:28.414 --> 02:29.403
Mulder!

02:31.217 --> 02:32.912
What's going on?

02:33.686 --> 02:35.449
l'm not sure l can explain.

02:35.522 --> 02:39.083
You called for a forensic excavation
at 5am on a Sunday?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.389
Just give me a minute, OK?

02:41.461 --> 02:43.520
What are you doing out here?

02:45.465 --> 02:49.367
l keep having this dream.
lt's about a little blonde girl.

02:49.435 --> 02:53.166
You're here because of something
you saw in a dream?

02:53.239 --> 02:54.228
Sir!

03:41.321 --> 03:44.813
Carefully remove all that. Easy.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.489
Tell me about this dream.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.996
l've had flashes of it three nights in a row,

03:51.064 --> 03:54.727
and last night it went on
long enough to lead me right to her.

03:56.169 --> 04:00.196
- l need the chest exposed.
- Yes, sir. ltjust takes a little time.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.871
Sir? Let us do that.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.508
lf you destroy evidence,
we may never know what happened.

04:13.586 --> 04:18.285
l know what happened. She was strangled.
He used an eight-gauge electrical cord.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.293
He took something from
the body postmortem - a trophy,

04:21.361 --> 04:25.593
a piece of fabric cut from her clothes
in the shape of a heart.

04:25.665 --> 04:30.500
- You got all these details from your dream?
- No. l know this MO from memory.

04:30.570 --> 04:33.095
- Whose MO?
- John Lee Roche.

04:33.172 --> 04:36.164
He killed 13 eight- to ten-year-old girls.

04:38.411 --> 04:39.435
This makes 14.

04:44.417 --> 04:48.353
lt was a difficult case.
He was extremely hard to catch.

04:48.421 --> 04:53.017
By 1990, ten victims had been found,
scattered across the Eastern seaboard.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.560
The earliest dated back to 1979.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.428
VlCAP named the case ''Paper Hearts''
because of the trophies the killer took.

04:59.499 --> 05:02.468
All the victims
were abducted from their homes.

05:02.535 --> 05:07.268
Reggie Purdue brought me in because
he thought l could get inside the killer's head.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.468
- Did you?
- l concluded we were looking for a salesman.

05:10.543 --> 05:15.947
Someone who traveled a lot, who could
gain people's confidence, someone ordinary.

05:16.015 --> 05:20.008
Roche was a vacuum cleaner salesman.
His job took him all over the Northeast.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.314
He'd be in someone's home,

05:21.387 --> 05:24.356
demonstrating his vacuum,
and he'd be checking out their kids.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.984
He'd choose a victim
and come back for her months later.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.154
But it was your profile that caught him.

05:30.630 --> 05:34.031
What about the trophies he took,
the cloth hearts?

05:34.100 --> 05:38.969
We never found them, but we had him
on 13 counts of murder. He admitted to 13.

05:39.038 --> 05:42.565
Polygraph said he was telling the truth,
but it always bugged me.

05:42.642 --> 05:48.080
l always wanted to find those hearts and
count them, see if they really added up to 13.

05:48.147 --> 05:50.047
l guess they didn't.

05:50.583 --> 05:55.452
lf nothing else,
l think l can at least help explain your dream.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.689
l don't think
you ever stopped thinking about this case.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.990
l believe you solved it in your sleep.

06:03.062 --> 06:07.499
You think that l've had this information
about a 14th victim all the time

06:07.567 --> 06:12.231
- and l've been processing it unconsciously?
- You said it yourself once.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.296
You said that a...

06:14.374 --> 06:18.868
a dream is an answer to a question
we haven't learned how to ask.

06:19.612 --> 06:22.638
You did good work, Mulder.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.614
Let's identify this girl
so we can put her to rest.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.660
l believe her name is Addie Sparks.

06:45.738 --> 06:50.266
She went missing from her home
in Pennsylvania, in June 1975.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.278
l contacted the Center for Missing
and Exploited Children,

06:53.346 --> 06:56.941
- ran a search through the database.
- 1975's too early.

06:57.016 --> 07:01.419
l think the match is right. The height is right;
the description of the sleeper is right.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.388
That would mean Roche started
way before we thought he did.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.984
Mulder, we're gonna have to verify this.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.221
Are you up for that?

07:29.949 --> 07:32.042
- Frank Sparks?
- Can l help you?

07:32.118 --> 07:37.488
Yes. l'm Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the FBl. May we speak with you?

07:38.724 --> 07:40.692
You've found Addie.

07:47.934 --> 07:51.062
This was for the tooth fairy.

07:51.137 --> 07:55.471
When Addie was asleep at night,
l'd come and put a quarter in this pocket.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.275
Her mother sewed it.

07:58.344 --> 08:02.144
- Where is your wife, sir?
- She passed away last summer.

08:06.052 --> 08:11.388
So you're saying the man
that did this is already in prison?

08:11.457 --> 08:13.584
Yes, sir, and he won't get out.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.990
You do this full-time, telling people...
this kind of news?

08:18.064 --> 08:19.656
No, sir, not full-time.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.560
- lt's not a good job.
- No.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.935
l used to think...

08:29.008 --> 08:31.943
that missing was worse than dead because

08:32.645 --> 08:35.511
you never knew what happened.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.981
But now that l know,

08:38.049 --> 08:40.245
l'm glad my wife's not here.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.283
She got luckier.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.319
How many more people like me

08:48.394 --> 08:51.488
- are you gonna visit today?
- Sir?

08:52.265 --> 08:56.258
Were there other victims
you didn't know about?

09:13.686 --> 09:16.621
Roche's car. Roche drove a white El Camino.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.556
- l saw it in my dream.
- What are you saying?

09:19.625 --> 09:22.059
The cloth hearts,
he would have wanted them close.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.688
For a traveling salesman,
that means inside the car.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.961
You're saying the hearts
might still be in his car?

09:28.034 --> 09:32.300
He doesn't have them in prison. His cell
is searched regularly. His mail is examined.

09:32.371 --> 09:37.138
His car was sold at auction in 1992,
put beyond his reach. lt's worth a look.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.837
We gotta find those hearts, to count them.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.773
Don't you think the car's
been searched already?

09:42.848 --> 09:43.837
Not by me.

09:46.619 --> 09:47.483
Here it is.

09:47.553 --> 09:50.021
l've been, you know, detailing it.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.616
Dropped the bed shell and did the decals,
stuff like that.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.856
- Thank you.
- Honest-to-God serial killer owned my car?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.157
For real?

10:25.191 --> 10:26.624
l'm helping him detail.

10:35.334 --> 10:39.134
- Something's wrong here, Scully.
- Maybe it's underneath.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.241
Mad Hat.

10:53.552 --> 10:56.043
Hey, Scully, the camper shell.

10:58.224 --> 11:01.057
The kid said he took the camper shell off.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.554
''Mad Hat.'' Mad Hatter.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.441
Eight,

11:51.510 --> 11:53.535
nine, ten,

11:53.612 --> 11:54.442
eleven,

11:54.513 --> 11:55.912
twelve, thirteen,

11:55.981 --> 11:56.743
fourteen...

11:56.816 --> 11:58.750
Addie Sparks!

11:59.518 --> 12:01.213
Fifteen,

12:01.320 --> 12:03.049
sixteen.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.925
He killed two more victims.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.054
Mulder.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.453
Long time no see.

12:46.665 --> 12:48.656
You got a new partner.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.432
Agent Scully.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.897
- So what's up?
- We found Addie Sparks, John.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.140
Congratulations, l guess.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.608
We also found your cloth hearts,

12:59.311 --> 13:01.302
all 16 of them.

13:02.481 --> 13:05.006
Sixteen victims, John.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.650
How come you said there were only 13?

13:08.721 --> 13:12.418
l don't know.
13 sounds more magical, you know?

13:14.860 --> 13:17.192
Tell us about the last two victims.

13:18.230 --> 13:21.791
- You're in for life. You've got nothing to lose.
- l got nothin' to gain.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.836
You can gain
one moment of decency in your life.

13:24.904 --> 13:28.340
You can finally let those families
put their daughters to rest.

13:28.407 --> 13:31.672
l understand you take this
very personally, Mulder.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.237
How about this?

13:37.216 --> 13:40.242
Sink one from there, and l'll tell you.

13:45.724 --> 13:48.192
You'd trust a child molester?

13:49.562 --> 13:52.497
You bring my hearts
and give them back to me,

13:53.599 --> 13:56.227
l'll tell you everything you wanna know.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.270
Coming out.

14:33.672 --> 14:38.632
..President Nixon and HR Haldeman
while transcribing the subpoenaed tape.

14:39.311 --> 14:43.543
Woods testified that she erased
about five minutes of the conversation,

14:43.616 --> 14:46.676
- but the tape contained...
- Fox, it's your move.

14:46.752 --> 14:49.482
Under investigation
from Senator Howard Baker,

14:49.555 --> 14:53.514
HR Haldeman reiterated
the White House explanation that...

14:53.592 --> 14:57.323
- Samantha.
- Are you gonna move or not?

14:58.063 --> 15:01.464
- Do we have to watch this?
- ..hitting the record button.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.593
lt would be very dicult to reach
the conclusion it was an accident.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.865
The magician comes on at nine.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.369
Mom and Dad said l could watch
the movie, buttmunch.

15:10.442 --> 15:14.538
They're next door at the Galbrands'.
They left me in charge.

15:17.983 --> 15:18.472
No!

15:27.960 --> 15:29.018
Not again.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.427
Samantha, run!

15:53.519 --> 15:55.180
Fox!

15:57.289 --> 15:58.586
Samantha!

16:39.531 --> 16:41.931
Did you bring me my hearts?

16:49.708 --> 16:55.442
Yesterday you said something about me
taking it personally. Why did you say that?

16:57.549 --> 16:59.881
Where were you in 1973?

16:59.952 --> 17:04.888
- What, the whole year?
- November. 27th of November.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.482
Do you know what l'm getting at?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.758
l was selling vacuum cleaners in 1973.

17:12.464 --> 17:16.491
l made a sales trip
to Martha's Vineyard that year, and

17:16.568 --> 17:19.502
l sold a vacuum cleaner to your dad.

17:22.107 --> 17:26.099
He bought it for your mom.
l believe it was a...

17:26.178 --> 17:29.705
ElectroVac Duchess or the Princess model.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.808
Your dad and l talked about it at great length.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.651
He had a really hard time choosing.

17:38.857 --> 17:41.121
What do you know about my sister?

17:42.995 --> 17:46.658
You bring me my hearts,
and maybe l'll tell you more.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.309
This man... This man hit me.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.148
l didn't see it.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.492
l did.

18:19.598 --> 18:23.193
He was there, Scully.
He was in the house. He took Samantha.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.533
ln your dream. lt was a dream.
Your mind made it up.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.938
A dream is an answer to a question
we don't know how to ask.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.135
Something buried in your subconscious.

18:32.211 --> 18:35.305
You heard him.
He mentioned being on Martha's Vineyard.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.405
ls it a state secret that you lived there?

18:37.483 --> 18:40.008
- How would he find out?
- The prison library.

18:40.085 --> 18:44.181
The inmates have access to computers
and the lnternet. l checked.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.981
- Roche logged on yesterday.
- Looking for what?

18:47.059 --> 18:52.053
The server records don't show, but on the Net
he can find out almost anything about you.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.192
He's playing with you. He's committing
emotional blackmail and you're letting him.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.998
You walked in there
with your heart on your sleeve.

18:59.071 --> 19:02.336
He saw vulnerability,
and he took advantage of it.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.102
You had a dream,

19:04.176 --> 19:09.808
a nightmare, because of all the emotions
this case is stirring up for you, but...

19:10.949 --> 19:14.385
- it was nothing but a dream.
- My last dream came true.

19:16.121 --> 19:20.285
Do you believe that my sister Samantha
was abducted by aliens?

19:21.827 --> 19:24.387
Have you ever believed that?

19:24.463 --> 19:26.021
No.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.862
So what do you think happened to her?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.192
What do you believe now?

19:31.270 --> 19:35.206
l don't know. l don't know what happened.
l don't know what to believe.

19:35.274 --> 19:38.243
l just know l have to find out now.

19:53.926 --> 19:58.056
- Fox?
- Mom. l'm in the basement.

19:58.397 --> 19:59.762
l'm sorry.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.695
l didn't mean to wake you up. l'm sorry.
How're you feeling?

20:03.769 --> 20:07.899
Good, Fox. What are you doin'
down here in the middle of the night?

20:12.010 --> 20:13.341
Do you recognize...

20:14.580 --> 20:17.208
- either of these fabrics?
- What am l looking at?

20:17.282 --> 20:20.251
Just look closely.
Do they seem familiar to you?

20:20.319 --> 20:22.913
- Familiar how?
- Just familiar.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.685
- Have you seen them before?
- l don't know what you want me to say.

20:26.758 --> 20:30.159
My memory isn't as good as it used to be
since l had the stroke.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.890
l just don't know what...

20:32.364 --> 20:34.195
lt's all right.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.336
Dad never bought you
a vacuum cleaner, did he?

20:39.404 --> 20:42.635
Yeah, a long time ago. l don't use it anymore.

20:42.708 --> 20:46.371
- Where is it?
- lt's here under the stairs in the storage.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.936
Fox, what is going on?

21:10.902 --> 21:15.305
Sir, l've been denied access to Roche.
l'm told the order comes from you.

21:15.374 --> 21:19.333
Could you tell me why you saw fit
to strike a prisoner in federal custody?

21:19.411 --> 21:22.437
Agent Scully didn't report that to me,
though she should have.

21:22.514 --> 21:25.039
lt was videotaped as per prison policy.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.347
- You're lucky l don't have your ass in a sling!
- Sir...

21:27.419 --> 21:30.547
You've gotten too close to this.
You've let this man get to you.

21:30.622 --> 21:34.490
l have reason to believe he can tell us
what happened to my sister Samantha.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.925
lt is looking possible, sir.

21:36.995 --> 21:40.590
John Lee Roche
apparently spent most of 1973 in Boston.

21:40.666 --> 21:45.069
He did take one sales trip
to Martha's Vineyard in October of that year.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.072
- The timing is right.
- l need to know.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.574
l just need to speak to him one more time.

21:50.642 --> 21:54.169
- This just makes it even less of a good idea.
- Sir, the fact remains

21:54.246 --> 21:57.579
that we still have two more victims
that we need to find and identify.

21:57.649 --> 22:02.552
No one has more insight into Roche
than Mulder, and this is still Mulder's case.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.482
You tread very lightly.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.719
You see that he does.

22:24.109 --> 22:27.704
l'm not talking to you
if you're gonna hit me again.

22:39.091 --> 22:43.084
No! You don't get to touch 'em.
They stay in the bag.

22:46.264 --> 22:50.257
- Name them.
- Well, l think you know one of them already.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.437
Prove it.

22:59.244 --> 23:01.576
Watergate was on TV.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.975
You and your sister

23:05.050 --> 23:07.211
were sitting in front of it

23:07.652 --> 23:11.179
playing a board game with little red and...

23:11.490 --> 23:13.458
blue plastic pieces.

23:13.992 --> 23:17.223
Anyway, you wanted to watch a TV show,

23:18.230 --> 23:22.257
the one with Bill Bixby.
What the heck was the name of that thing?

23:22.834 --> 23:25.166
How could you know what l said?

23:26.304 --> 23:29.967
l was watching... from the window.
l was very careful.

23:32.110 --> 23:34.772
lf that's true, tell me where my sister is.

23:37.949 --> 23:40.008
- Pick her out.
- What?

23:40.919 --> 23:45.379
You choose the one that was your sister,
and l'll tell you where she is.

23:46.024 --> 23:48.356
Hey, come on. lt's a 50-50 chance.

23:49.327 --> 23:52.387
Either way, l'm giving you a victim.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.629
That one.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.693
You sure you want that one?

24:02.707 --> 24:05.835
Just kidding. lt's, it's a good choice.

24:22.928 --> 24:23.724
Mulder?

24:24.863 --> 24:27.127
Let's get a team out here.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.729
- Let somebody else do this.
- Help me, Scully.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.697
Mulder?

26:08.967 --> 26:10.901
lt's not her, Scully.

26:11.636 --> 26:13.536
Am l right?

26:14.973 --> 26:20.536
Samantha broke her left collarbone when she
was six. We had a rope swing in the backyard.

26:20.612 --> 26:23.945
- lt's not broken, is it?
- You're right. lt's not a match.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.117
lt's not her.

26:31.456 --> 26:33.083
lt's somebody, though.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.489
Like l said, it was a 50-50 chance.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.562
Tell us the name of that girl.

26:45.637 --> 26:48.105
lt was Karen Ann Philiponte.

26:49.507 --> 26:53.273
She lived in a green rancher
in East Amherst, New York.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.279
Mint grew outside her window.

26:56.181 --> 26:59.810
l stood outside her window
atop sprigs of mint.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.213
- lt smelled wonderful.
- What year?

27:04.089 --> 27:06.023
July 1974.

27:06.958 --> 27:10.223
l had her mother on the hook
for an ElectroVac Argosy,

27:10.295 --> 27:13.662
but at the last minute
she said thanks, but no thanks.

27:16.701 --> 27:17.725
Oh, well.

27:31.149 --> 27:34.277
- lt's your sister.
- lf that's true, tell me where.

27:34.352 --> 27:36.377
You wanna know a lot more than that.

27:36.454 --> 27:40.447
You wanna know everything, right?
The big mystery revealed?

27:40.525 --> 27:43.961
- Drop the mind games.
- l can'tjust tell you.

27:44.596 --> 27:47.394
l mean, l know you don't believe me yet.

27:47.465 --> 27:51.026
You need me to show you,
to lead you through it, because

27:51.102 --> 27:56.199
after all these years, anything less than
that's not gonna satisfy you, right?

27:57.242 --> 28:00.905
- You just wanna get outta here.
- You're damn right l do!

28:01.413 --> 28:04.177
lf only for a day or two. l'm realistic.

28:07.552 --> 28:10.214
l mean, more than that, l...

28:11.289 --> 28:14.349
- l can't wait to see your face.
- Oh, God.

28:15.393 --> 28:20.228
You're gonna see the inside
of your cell instead. You're gonna rot there.

28:38.183 --> 28:40.174
Are you OK?

28:42.020 --> 28:45.512
The last thing we should do
is give this man his way on this.

28:45.590 --> 28:48.457
lf we do, he could string us along for ever.

28:48.993 --> 28:51.257
l know you appreciate that.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.594
There has to be another way
to come to the truth.

29:25.497 --> 29:28.762
- Clerk's office.
- This is Special Agent Fox Mulder, FBl,

29:28.833 --> 29:33.566
badge number: J047101111.

29:34.072 --> 29:37.508
l need a removal order for a federal prisoner.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.249
Can l use the lavatory?

29:49.087 --> 29:51.112
Keep your hands in your lap.

30:00.999 --> 30:04.127
- Something to drink?
- Excuse me.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.628
- First flight?
- Yeah. She's really excited.

30:09.707 --> 30:11.299
You having fun?

30:11.943 --> 30:13.911
- What's your name?
- Caitlin.

30:19.784 --> 30:21.877
What do you mean he checked out Roche?

30:21.953 --> 30:24.888
He convinced the judge
that it was an emergency situation.

30:24.956 --> 30:27.891
- And where were you?
- l had left Agent Mulder for the day.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.519
l suggested that he get some sleep.

30:30.595 --> 30:34.554
l have an idea of where he might
have gone, and l can catch up with him.

30:34.632 --> 30:38.261
- l'll catch up with him. Where's he headed?
- Martha's Vineyard.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.430
l hope that you appreciate
the uniqueness of this situation

30:41.506 --> 30:46.068
- and its effect on Agent Mulder.
- l understand the effect it has on him.

30:46.144 --> 30:49.875
That was the sum and total
of my last words to you on the subject.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.277
You let me down.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.611
Let's clean up this mess
before it gets out of hand.

31:09.734 --> 31:11.167
No one home?

31:21.980 --> 31:27.145
l sat on this couch. You know,
when your dad bought the vacuum.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.650
- You ready?
- Go.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.954
November 27, 1973.

31:33.024 --> 31:38.656
l watched the house for hours.
l parked across the way, out over there.

31:38.730 --> 31:42.496
l was just casing.
l wasn't planning for this to be the night.

31:42.567 --> 31:46.833
But then, all of a sudden,
your parents leave, and l figure...

31:47.405 --> 31:49.236
Where'd they go?

31:51.709 --> 31:54.906
House next door... to play pinochle.
l don't know.

31:54.979 --> 31:57.914
- Whatever it was people did back then.
- Go on.

31:57.982 --> 32:01.543
After they're gone, l get out of my car,
and l move closer,

32:02.153 --> 32:05.213
and l watched you and your sister

32:05.356 --> 32:08.484
playing that board game.

32:08.559 --> 32:11.289
A little after eight, l'm about ready.

32:11.362 --> 32:13.956
So l move to the junction box.

32:14.032 --> 32:16.500
l cut the power, and the lights go off.

32:17.802 --> 32:21.898
l moved around to the front door
and was ready to kick the door in.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.634
lt was unlocked.

32:25.043 --> 32:28.376
lt was 1973.
lt was a different world back then.

32:29.180 --> 32:32.172
- Then what did you do?
- Well, you remember that.

32:33.518 --> 32:36.954
l came in the front door
and you tried to get your father's gun.

32:37.021 --> 32:40.548
l give you credit for that.
But then you froze and then

32:42.961 --> 32:46.863
l took your sister away from all this...
to a happier place.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.023
That's exactly how it happened?

32:50.635 --> 32:53.103
- Right here in this room?
- Yeah.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.501
Wrong house.

32:58.509 --> 33:01.376
My father bought this
after he and my mother divorced.

33:01.446 --> 33:07.385
The house that Samantha was abducted from
is in Chilmark. That's six miles from here!

33:07.452 --> 33:10.250
You screwed up. You weren't here.
You didn't take Samantha.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.313
- Wishful thinking.
- No, but l think l know what happened.

33:13.391 --> 33:16.417
- Somehow you got inside my dreams.
- Come again?

33:16.494 --> 33:20.191
l profiled you. l got inside your head.
Maybe you got inside mine.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.926
Maybe some nexus
was formed between us.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.266
And through that, you got access
to my memories of my sister.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.602
- You used them against me for this.
- You're just resisting me.

33:29.674 --> 33:34.168
You're in the wrong house, you stupid
son of a bitch! You were never here!

33:34.245 --> 33:38.181
lt's geography. lt was 23 years ago.
lt's geography we're talking about.

33:38.249 --> 33:42.242
Yeah, but you remember
all the other details so vividly.

33:42.754 --> 33:47.555
That's because you watched it
through my eyes, through my dreams.

33:51.129 --> 33:54.895
l hear things about you, Mulder.
You know what l heard?

33:54.966 --> 33:58.697
l heard you go after aliens... from space.

33:59.771 --> 34:03.434
lt's like your world will be OK as long as
you can believe in flying saucers.

34:07.645 --> 34:11.012
But l'm telling you the God's honest truth.

34:11.081 --> 34:14.677
And l can see you're not as open-minded
as you think you are.

34:15.485 --> 34:18.683
You must have been
one hell of a salesman, Roche.

34:19.590 --> 34:24.186
First flight's at 6am. Enjoy your last
few hours of freedom. Come on.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.147
Fox!

34:54.192 --> 34:56.319
Fox! Help!

34:56.561 --> 34:58.961
Unlock me! Help!

34:59.097 --> 35:00.462
Help me!

35:03.000 --> 35:04.627
Fox, help me!

35:04.902 --> 35:06.267
Help me!

35:06.404 --> 35:08.235
Unlock me! Fox!

35:13.177 --> 35:16.635
Fox! Fox, help me! Unlock me!

35:16.981 --> 35:18.039
Fox!

35:45.610 --> 35:47.043
Mulder?

35:48.579 --> 35:50.570
Mulder, open the door!

35:51.015 --> 35:52.607
You let Roche go?

35:52.683 --> 35:55.914
l must've done it in my sleep.
l had another dream.

35:55.987 --> 35:59.150
Why don't you check
to see if anybody saw him leave.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.518
He took the last cloth heart.

36:01.592 --> 36:05.551
- He also took your badge and your phone.
- Where's your gun?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.463
- How do you explain yourself?
- l don't.

36:09.534 --> 36:15.234
A predator is loose because of you.
God knows how many hours' lead he's got.

36:15.306 --> 36:18.332
Any idea where he might be headed?

36:20.111 --> 36:21.635
- Yeah.
- Where?

36:21.712 --> 36:23.236
Where's your phone?

36:24.982 --> 36:28.076
- There was a small child on the plane.
- What child?

36:29.887 --> 36:30.615
Seaboard Air.

36:30.688 --> 36:34.954
- Please put me through to your supervisor.
- What child?

36:35.026 --> 36:40.293
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder, FBl.
l'd like a passenger manifest for Flight 1650

36:40.364 --> 36:44.460
from Washington National to Boston,
8:50pm last night.

36:44.535 --> 36:48.403
- My badge number is JTT...
- l'm sorry. Agent Mulder called.

36:50.041 --> 36:54.171
An Agent Mulder called just ten minutes ago.
They gave him the same information.

36:58.783 --> 37:00.876
He said he was with the FBl.

37:00.952 --> 37:05.446
He said her mother was in an accident,
and he needed to take Caitlin.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.957
- You said he was a white male?
- Yeah.

37:08.025 --> 37:11.620
- About how tall was he?
- He was about 6'5'' or something.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.628
He said his name was Mulder.

37:16.701 --> 37:19.465
He had a badge. He said he was official.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.198
Oh my God, what have l done?

37:22.139 --> 37:26.303
We sent a unit to pick up the girl's mother.
She's on her way down.

37:26.377 --> 37:29.312
What am l going to tell her? lt's all my fault.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.644
lt's not your fault.

37:31.716 --> 37:33.240
lt's my fault.

37:37.955 --> 37:40.924
l'm sorry. You were right. He was playing me.

37:40.992 --> 37:45.361
- You don't think he took Samantha?
- None of that really matters now.

37:45.429 --> 37:48.227
Where do you think he'd take this girl?

37:48.299 --> 37:50.529
Would he drive her out of state?

37:50.601 --> 37:55.800
No reason to. He knows we'll catch him.
He just needs it to be later rather than sooner.

37:55.873 --> 37:57.272
He'll be somewhere nearby.

37:57.341 --> 38:00.572
Do you think
he'd take her someplace familiar?

38:00.645 --> 38:03.876
Try to relive some past glories?
l don't know, maybe. What?

38:03.948 --> 38:06.883
He lived in Boston in the early '70s, right?

38:08.886 --> 38:11.616
- What've you got?
- Roche's old address in the area.

38:11.689 --> 38:14.487
9809 Alice Road, apartment number 6.

38:14.558 --> 38:15.320
He's there.

38:15.393 --> 38:18.419
- How do you know?
- Alice in Wonderland. He's the Mad Hatter.

38:18.496 --> 38:21.294
That's where he got the idea in the first place.

38:21.499 --> 38:21.828
All right, let's go!

38:29.340 --> 38:31.672
Check the other rooms!

38:33.077 --> 38:35.671
l don't think he brought her here.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.816
He never brought anyone here.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.111
No one, sir!

38:52.129 --> 38:55.530
All right, spread out! Find the entrance!

40:29.960 --> 40:33.919
l'm beginning to believe
we do share that... nexus you spoke of.

40:34.965 --> 40:37.160
You always seem to find me.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.166
Are you OK, Caitlin?

40:41.972 --> 40:45.874
Good. My name is Fox.
l'm gonna take you home.

40:48.012 --> 40:49.479
l have your gun, Fox.

40:51.782 --> 40:55.149
Caitlin, can you do me a favor?
Can you count to 20? Can you do that?

40:55.219 --> 40:59.383
Will you close your eyes
and count to 20 out loud, quietly and slowly?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.722
One, two,

41:02.927 --> 41:04.258
three,...

41:05.529 --> 41:06.689
l will shoot.

41:06.764 --> 41:08.823
Don't make this end badly.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.395
..six,

41:12.470 --> 41:13.835
seven,...

41:14.472 --> 41:19.273
You're not giving me much choice.
l don't wanna go back to prison.

41:19.376 --> 41:21.367
Put the gun down, Roche!

41:21.445 --> 41:24.710
..11, 12,...

41:25.015 --> 41:27.142
You have one left.

41:27.218 --> 41:30.210
How are you gonna find her without me?

41:30.654 --> 41:33.623
How sure are you it's not Samantha?

41:37.761 --> 41:40.525
How do you know?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.463
..19...

41:47.371 --> 41:48.929
lt's OK. l got you.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.134
Call an ambulance.

42:35.986 --> 42:37.977
l got back some lab results.

42:38.055 --> 42:41.491
The dye analysis determined
that the fabric of the last heart

42:41.559 --> 42:46.121
was manufactured between 1969 and 1974,

42:46.196 --> 42:51.065
but beyond that,
there's nothing more they can tell us.

42:51.135 --> 42:53.899
Mulder, it's not Samantha.

42:54.138 --> 42:58.575
And whoever that little girl really is,
we'll find her.

42:58.976 --> 43:00.102
How?

43:01.045 --> 43:02.637
l don't know,

43:03.547 --> 43:05.139
but l do know you.

43:10.854 --> 43:14.119
