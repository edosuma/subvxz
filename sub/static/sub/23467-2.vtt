00:05.906 --> 00:08.209
The Assassination
of Gianni Versace.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.711
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.882
FX presents Baskets.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.984
MAN: Get on with it!

00:19.287 --> 00:21.322
DALE: Guess what. Baskets
Family Rodeo now owns three

00:21.355 --> 00:22.890
-beautiful stallions.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.260
-CHIP: Dale, come on, Dale!
-Give the horse space!

00:26.294 --> 00:28.496
Give the horse space!

00:28.529 --> 00:30.598
They're crazy, man!
They're crazy!

00:31.899 --> 00:33.267
-You got swindled, Dale.
-Okay.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.735
Yeah, I got swindled. From who?!

00:34.768 --> 00:36.770
Jim Jack Mahoney.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.339
Jim Jack Mahoney?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.774
JJM ain't no good.
He can't be trusted.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.911
-We've got to fix this.
-This is your fault!

00:49.950 --> 00:51.619
-I don't find that funny.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.122
-Okay. Now here we go.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.224
-DALE: Quiet, cowboys.
-All right, welcome

00:56.257 --> 00:57.758
to the rodeo meeting.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.194
First off, bathrooms.

01:00.228 --> 01:03.864
Yeah, somebody graffitied
the bathroom to say "Dale-do."

01:03.897 --> 01:06.600
I know what that is.
I know what a Dale-do is.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.369
That's a play on words
with my name,

01:08.402 --> 01:10.638
-and I do not appreciate it.
-Yes, don't do it.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.373
-Don't sexualize my name,
please. -Don't do it.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.075
Now, how are we gonna fix
those crazy horses?

01:15.109 --> 01:18.045
Lady, we don't break horses.
We ride 'em.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.447
-Yee-haw!

01:19.480 --> 01:21.081
Well, what's the difference?

01:21.115 --> 01:23.317
!

01:23.351 --> 01:25.553
Okay, guys, listen,
hear her out.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.088
Mom's cool. This is
her first rodeo. Go ahead, Mom.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.057
Oh, thank you, Chip.
You're cool, too.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.826
Okay, now,

01:32.860 --> 01:34.795
a round of compliments
and resentments.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.164
MAN:
I can't cash this paycheck

01:36.197 --> 01:38.399
on account
I ain't got no bank account.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.734
Now our last boss, Eddie-- well,

01:40.768 --> 01:43.504
he paid me off in a little hooch
and a little coochie.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.441
Yeah, Eddie set up
a direct deposit for me.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.680
-Our boss-- he was the best.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.349
Okay, I have an announcement
to make. Eddie is dead.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.485
!
-Well, that is what

01:57.518 --> 02:00.488
we should assume because this is
the Baskets Family Rodeo,

02:00.521 --> 02:02.623
not the Eddie Family Rodeo.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.025
-That's right.
-MAN: Oh, hell, no, uh-uh!

02:05.058 --> 02:07.795
I'm out of here. I'm gonna
go home and iron my socks.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.930
-Hey, now, we're not finished
with this meeting! -Hello.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.933
-Baskets. What a joke.
-Hey. Hey.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.869
That was a good meeting.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.805
You know?

02:17.838 --> 02:20.608
But, Mom, we don't know what
we're doing with this rodeo.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.142
Let me get Eddie back.

02:22.176 --> 02:26.214
Oh, I wanted this to be
a family thing, our thing.

02:26.247 --> 02:29.717
I know that, but you got to
listen, I need to go find Eddie.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.319
I'll bring him here.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.153
He can break these horses
in no time, all right?

02:33.187 --> 02:35.556
I just need to find him.
Please?

02:38.226 --> 02:41.028
Okay, go. Get him.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.337
Yeah, I love ponds.

02:49.370 --> 02:53.006
What's the leech situation like
out there?

02:53.040 --> 02:55.843
Uh-huh. Right. Um,

02:55.876 --> 02:57.311
hey, Craig, I'm sorry.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.712
I'm gonna have to let you go.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.348
My friend is staring at me.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.982
-Hey, Chip.
-Hey, Martha.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.917
I need you to drive me around
so I can find Eddie.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.254
Sure. Where was he last seen?

03:06.287 --> 03:09.590
You can just leave work
like that?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.058
Yeah. Today's my day off.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.227
I just came in
to make long distance calls.

03:13.261 --> 03:16.330
-Oh. You know people
out of state? -Yeah.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.566
DALE: Mom, you're gonna
want to hear this.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.534
I'm getting ready
to call that Jim Jack Mahoney,

03:20.568 --> 03:22.603
the guy that sold us
those horseshit horses,

03:22.636 --> 03:25.906
and give him a piece of my mind,
and read him the riot act.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.776
Well, I think Chip is gonna get
someone to break the horses.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.178
Chip's supposed
to be getting clowns, Mom.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.846
Have you seen any bozo types,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.915
besides Chip himself,
around here?

03:34.948 --> 03:36.684
I wouldn't count on it.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.252
Well, okay, honey.
Do what you want.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.588
Use my phone if you want.
I got a brand-new...

03:40.621 --> 03:42.956
Look at this.
Do you love it?

03:42.990 --> 03:46.294
-It's hands-free.
-Okay, look at this.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.029
I don't know the name of it,
but it's very comfortable.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.064
Never trust anyone

03:51.098 --> 03:55.102
with three names.
James Earl Ray.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.537
-John Wilkes Booth.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.871
:
This is Jim Jack.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.275
Yes. Is this Jim Jack Mahoney?

04:01.309 --> 04:04.077
Yes, this is
Dale Everett Baskets

04:04.111 --> 04:05.979
calling
from Baskets Family Rodeo.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.648
Yeah, I want to let you know
that you're messing

04:07.681 --> 04:09.049
with the wrong family

04:09.082 --> 04:11.685
when you sold us
those shit horses.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.089
Yeah.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.292
:
David Lee Roth.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.563
Well, I mean, I hear
what you're saying, but I...

04:22.596 --> 04:26.300
Mm-hmm, I understand.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.669
Thank you so much.
It's been a real pleasure.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.339
:
Okay. You, too. Bye-bye.

04:35.876 --> 04:40.448
Well, why don't you just talk
to him face

04:40.481 --> 04:42.483
Do you want me
to go with you, honey?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.952
No.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.656
* I'll make you happy...

04:48.689 --> 04:51.925
Hey, what can I get you
this fine morning?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.827
We'd like
to get some information.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.929
Um, we're looking
for a man named Eddie.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.933
He's kind of a mumbly-mouthed
guy, um, about this tall.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.536
Never makes any sense.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.805
Nah, I don't know him.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.477
That's... odd.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.212
Eddie's always talking
about this place.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.515
I don't know why
the bartender doesn't know him.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.183
I think he does.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.818
On Law & Order,

05:17.851 --> 05:21.522
bartenders are always
being evasive for no reason.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.991
-Psst.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.393
Her?

05:25.426 --> 05:26.860
:
The lady.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.796
All right. I think
this might be a lead.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.698
It's not a catcall.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.633
Yeah, I know Eddie.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.234
Used to come here all the time.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.670
-I hear he's back in AA.
-Okay.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.039
Wait. Aren't you supposed
to keep that a secret?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.141
I'm not in it.
I can say what I please.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.076
Okay. Uh, fair enough.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.879
Could I compensate you
for that information?

05:45.913 --> 05:50.150
I've got a couple of fives
and... some Certs.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.052
WOMAN:
I was out with co-workers,

05:52.085 --> 05:55.022
grabbing a couple beers
after work.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.990
Thought I could handle it.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.694
Woke up the next morning with
a quesadilla sitting on a plate

06:00.728 --> 06:03.764
in my bed
that I do not remember making.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.533
I could have
burned the house down.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.367
Eddie would have loved that
story. He loves quesadillas.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.002
WOMAN:
Thanks.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.371
-Somebody must know something.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.707
: Don't talk.
-Hi. Okay.

06:13.741 --> 06:17.010
Guys? Hi. Um, yeah.
Hi. I'm Martha.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.780
I'm not an alcoholic,
I'm pretty sure.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.783
Um, I get a headache
after two drinks.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.686
Although I always have
the two, so who knows?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.755
But, anyway, um, I'm here

06:27.788 --> 06:30.123
because our friend Eddie
is missing,

06:30.157 --> 06:33.193
and he used to come
to this meeting,

06:33.226 --> 06:36.096
so if any of you have seen Eddie
from the rodeo,

06:36.129 --> 06:38.732
could you please,
after the meeting, come

06:38.766 --> 06:43.904
and see me, Martha B, or, um,
Chip Baskets, or Chip B.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.475
Um, the "B" stands
for something else.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.543
Bye.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.045
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.948
Um, I know Eddie.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.917
Oh, you do?
That's great. That's great.

06:56.950 --> 07:00.621
Yeah. Last I heard,
he told me that

07:00.654 --> 07:03.323
he was staying with a rich lady
about an hour east of town.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.425
Wow. Results.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.828
:
Results.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.901
Oh. You have such a nice smile.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.137
-Thanks.
-Yeah. So, um,

07:17.170 --> 07:20.908
out by the lake, there's
that mansion up on the hill

07:20.941 --> 07:22.743
-that looks kind of
like a castle? -Okay.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.845
Yeah, I think
I do know that area.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.413
My boyfriend works out there.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.348
Boyfriend?

07:28.381 --> 07:29.983
Well...

07:30.017 --> 07:32.352
You could have mentioned that
in your share.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.321
Thank you for the information.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.524
Why did you lie and tell
that guy you had a boyfriend?

07:36.557 --> 07:38.425
-He was hitting on you.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.994
I know. I wasn't lying.
I do have a boyfriend.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.396
I have two, actually.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.510
What? He's a shepherd
from the Basque region?

07:56.544 --> 07:58.946
In

07:58.979 --> 08:00.614
Yeah, there's a big
Basque community here,

08:00.648 --> 08:03.350
and I met him
outside the feed store.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.886
So I asked him out for coffee,
and we're gonna go out

08:05.919 --> 08:08.221
when he gets back in town
to shear his flock.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.124
So you...
so you don't have a boyfriend?

08:11.158 --> 08:13.493
Well, I mean,
it's in the early stages,

08:13.527 --> 08:16.329
but the signals I'm getting
from him are pretty strong.

08:16.363 --> 08:19.232
-Well,

08:19.266 --> 08:21.068
how do you know
when you like somebody?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.703
Don't you just get a feeling?

08:22.736 --> 08:27.040
Sometimes it feels like
excitement, um, mostly panic.

08:27.074 --> 08:30.644
And that's kind of the problem
with this shepherd.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.981
He's very beautiful, and
I don't trust that in a person.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.584
So I'm kind of leaning more

08:36.617 --> 08:40.387
towards the cross-country
trucker I met on my CB radio.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.156
You have a CB radio?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.992
Yeah, it's an heirloom.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.161
And you just talk to truckers

08:48.195 --> 08:50.163
that are passing through town
on your CB?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.165
Well, it's just...
Now it's just one.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.434
Maybe I like him
'cause it's not a challenge.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.104
I don't even have to wear makeup
when we hang out.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.674
I just lie on the bed, and
he sings to me over the radio.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.743
I don't want to hear
about your sex life, Martha.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.078
Really? 'Cause it kind of
seems like you do.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.614
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh!

09:06.647 --> 09:08.515
Ken, it's such
a beautiful gift!

09:08.548 --> 09:10.884
Bluetooth, huh?

09:10.918 --> 09:13.286
Well, I knew how much
you liked mine, and I figured

09:13.320 --> 09:15.689
if there's anybody
that needs to be hands-free

09:15.723 --> 09:17.224
and on the move, it's you.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.059
:
Oh, you got that right.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.761
It never stops around here.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.296
Now, all you have to do is
touch it, and it'll answer.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.432
-Okay, I think I got it now.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.601
-Okay, call me back.
-All right.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.936
All right,
now I'm gonna hang up now.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.403
Okay. See you in a sec.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.439
Uh, hello.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.608
Oh, hello.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.209
The door was open, and I, uh...

09:36.243 --> 09:37.978
But I'm Daniel Kwon.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.880
I'm your neighbor from Awaken?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.448
-We're that church next door.
-Oh.

09:41.481 --> 09:45.052
Awaken. I've seen your sign!
I love it!

09:45.085 --> 09:47.120
-I'm Christine Baskets.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.456
-Oh.
-Ow! God!

09:49.489 --> 09:51.424
So loud. Technology.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.127
Well, uh, here.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.496
This is on behalf of
the entire Awaken congregation.

09:56.529 --> 10:00.634
Oh, you know, I've been thinking
about going Paleo.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.636
Oh, God, what a carrot, huh?

10:02.670 --> 10:04.171
What's up, Doc?

10:04.204 --> 10:05.639
You know the cartoon?

10:05.673 --> 10:07.307
Oh. Bugs Bunny.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.309
-Yeah.
-Yes. Yes, it's-it's wonderful.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.244
-Just wonderful.
-Yes, I love Bugs.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.246
These are good.
This is quite a carrot.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.616
It's just, um, those are meant
to be for horses, but I mean,

10:16.650 --> 10:18.986
-however you want to... -Oh, no.
I knew that. I knew that.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.954
Oh.
-Oh.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.522
-I should...
-Hey, uh, you should get that.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.091
But, uh, you come visit us
at Awaken any time.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.793
Any time.
-Okay.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.261
Hi, Ken. Sorry.
I got a carrot delivery.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.863
Can you believe it?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.268
So what's the plan
when we get there?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.337
There's no plan.
We're gonna knock on the door

10:37.370 --> 10:39.372
and take Eddie
to fix the horses. That's it.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.108
Well, what if he's in love?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.310
You know, you should be prepared
to have an argument

10:43.343 --> 10:45.713
that'll convince him
how much you need him.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.648
Well, maybe I'll just sing him
a song over a CB radio.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.450
It's very funny, Chip.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.519
You know, I guess
you just don't understand.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.287
I'm trying
to connect with people,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.489
and I really put myself
out there on the airwaves.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.658
Martha, this whole car ride,

10:58.692 --> 11:00.460
you have been telling me
about your boyfriends

11:00.493 --> 11:02.462
that you've never even met.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.331
I was married.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.734
Are you talking
about that French lady

11:06.767 --> 11:08.501
who didn't live with you
or talk to you,

11:08.535 --> 11:10.137
with the brown hair?

11:10.170 --> 11:13.040
Yeah, at least I know
that she exists, you know?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.976
God, okay, okay, sorry.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.811
I'm sorry.
I-I... I lost my temper.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.379
-I'm sorry.
-No. Look. We're here.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.315
CHIP:
What a nice, dumpy castle.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.419
I think that crow
is yelling at us.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.888
What's he saying?

11:27.921 --> 11:29.923
Sorry, we don't have any seeds.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.525
Keep your mouth shut!

11:36.229 --> 11:38.231
Who's there?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.067
CHIP:
Yes, hi, uh,

11:40.100 --> 11:42.435
we were told that, uh, that
someone named Eddie is here.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.971
We're looking for Eddie.

11:50.377 --> 11:54.915
Did you say you're
friends of Eddie's?

11:54.948 --> 11:57.017
-Y-Yes, ma'am.
-Hmm.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.353
Oh, come on in.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.721
-Go ahead. Go.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.223
I'm Dottie.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.225
I don't remember him

12:05.258 --> 12:08.628
mentioning anything
about friends, but, you know...

12:08.661 --> 12:10.697
Well, we're... we're kind of
more of his colleagues.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.934
This is Eddie.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.203
He's been riding for our family
for years.

12:16.236 --> 12:21.074
We call him Stretch,
one of the best dressage riders

12:21.108 --> 12:23.376
-in California.
-Wow.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.412
I'm sure he told you about it.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.948
Oh, yeah, I mean, uh, well,
Martha doesn't know anything,

12:27.981 --> 12:29.950
but I-I know that Eddie's good
with horses.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.484
Uh, that's actually why
I'm here.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.486
My family's rodeo is having
some horse issues,

12:33.520 --> 12:35.255
and I was hoping that I could
take Eddie with me

12:35.288 --> 12:37.457
to help out
at my family's rodeo.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.330
Now, let's see
if we can find him.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.764
-Let's go take a look.
-Okay.

12:44.798 --> 12:48.168
Ah...

12:50.203 --> 12:51.905
Stretch?

12:51.939 --> 12:54.141
Where are you?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.410
I bet you're out by the well,
huh?

12:57.444 --> 13:00.848
Okay.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.649
Stretch!

13:05.485 --> 13:07.520
She's been gone a while, Martha.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.422
I know. It's kind of weird.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.426
Why is that guy
still yelling at us?

13:14.627 --> 13:17.330
Ah, I got you.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.499
-Down, down.
-Oh.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.935
Ah, they've been eating my figs.

13:21.969 --> 13:26.306
I guess that crow's not gonna be
yelling at us anymore.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.009
Well, I-I don't know
what happened.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.845
We looked everywhere.
I don't know where he is.

13:31.879 --> 13:36.016
I... all I know is I'm sure
he's around here somewhere.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.451
That's me.

13:38.485 --> 13:43.190
Little Dot
from the Hires Root Beer ad.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.892
Wow, you were a child actor?

13:44.925 --> 13:47.027
No.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.496
Just a rich kid.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.399
Hires is my family's company.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.967
Wow.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.568
Would you like some wine?

13:55.602 --> 13:58.005
-Yes, very much.
-Oh, boy, I'll be right back.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.139
I want some wine, too.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.476
I like wine.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.682
Did she lock that?

14:09.716 --> 14:11.184
Eddie's not here.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.685
Yeah, I gathered that, Chip.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.890
CHIP: She probably
turned that on, right?

14:16.924 --> 14:20.928
She probably does that for all
of her ghosts... guests, guests.

14:20.961 --> 14:24.497
Okay, I'm sorry for losing
my cool, but I'm freaking out.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.865
Well, looks like
we're stuck here now.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.567
And the only person
that knows that we're here

14:27.600 --> 14:29.169
is that guy from the AA meeting
that you rebuffed.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.203
Thanks for nothing.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.604
That was a time you could've
used your body,

14:31.638 --> 14:34.574
you know, for detective work.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.876
Oh, cool... wait,
we're gonna be detectives?

14:42.815 --> 14:45.085
It's like a voice in my head.
It's like you're right there

14:45.118 --> 14:46.686
and my hands are free.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.021
Oh, what a great invention,
the Bluetooth.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.622
Now, listen, Ken,

14:49.656 --> 14:53.893
I'm going to, uh, try and feed
these nutty horses.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.562
: All right.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.430
So if anything happens
or if you hear a...

14:57.464 --> 15:00.233
...or whatever
it is, I'm telling you,

15:00.267 --> 15:02.535
call Bakersfield 911.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.871
I'm telling you...
no, I'm just kidding.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.539
Well, I'm a little nervous.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.443
Okay. I think
this one's name is Kitty.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.878
Hey, Kitty.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.280
-Aah!

15:13.313 --> 15:15.282
Aah, aah, they're crazy!

15:16.816 --> 15:19.786
-Oh, God, he tried to kill me.

15:19.819 --> 15:23.290
Yup, I can't pick
this kind of lock.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.924
If worse comes to worse,

15:24.958 --> 15:27.394
we can eat some of that popcorn
from the Dust Bowl.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.231
Chip, here's the thing:
we don't have any reception,

15:31.264 --> 15:32.966
we can't get out of this room,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.768
and in about ten minutes
I'm gonna start screaming

15:35.802 --> 15:37.404
and I won't be able to stop.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.173
Well,
what about your reception?

15:40.207 --> 15:43.343
You know, with those signals
that you were talking about?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.512
Well, um, I think there's
a really good chance

15:45.545 --> 15:46.913
she's got other people locked up

15:46.946 --> 15:49.149
in other rooms of this house.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.817
Maybe some hitchhikers

15:50.850 --> 15:53.586
or a kid trying to sell
magazines door-to-door.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.188
Howdy, kids.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.991
Jesus. Eddie, hey.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.293
-Been a while.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.594
Listen, you got to get us
out of here.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.829
This old lady's crazy.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.864
Dottie?

16:04.897 --> 16:07.267
Dottie's just
a happy bundle of fun.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.137
She's just afraid you're gonna
take me away from her.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.372
Isn't that right, Dottie?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.841
-Jesus.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.443
Hi, Dottie.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.845
I'm afraid our friends
from the city

16:18.878 --> 16:21.148
are going to be disappointed.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.883
How about you and I just
show 'em a good time

16:23.916 --> 16:25.685
and send them on their way?

16:25.718 --> 16:28.388
Absolutely, partner,
I'm all for it.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.822
Let's do it.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.659
-Go.
-I'll get the fondue set.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.497
Thank you for another
delicious dinner, dear.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.999
Ah, to my prince
in a white castle.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.472
I would love for you
to come and help us

16:45.505 --> 16:47.240
with these horses, please.

16:47.274 --> 16:50.577
Well, this old lady here,
she's been awful good to me.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.012
Remember Betty Boop?

16:53.046 --> 16:55.748
And this, uh, mansion living,
it's kind of fun.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.318
-I like it.
-Yeah.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.988
I expect maybe I could fix
your horses, though.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.591
-Okay.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.892
Are you leaving me, Stretch?

17:05.925 --> 17:07.360
Oh, Dottie, no.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.828
I'm not leaving you.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.997
Why, this is my home.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.999
This is where I grew up.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.568
Grew from a boy breaking horses

17:15.602 --> 17:18.004
into a man breaking hearts.

17:18.037 --> 17:22.242
Oh, Stretch. What would I do
without you?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.244
-Mm.

17:24.277 --> 17:28.681
Dottie, I think I hear
your boys outside.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.717
-Oh, shit!
: Open this door.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.452
-Her kids are crazy.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.555
They think I'm stealing
from her.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.625
Coming over here to kill us both
and claim I did it.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.593
Okay, look, Eddie, if you need
me to help you fight them,

17:40.627 --> 17:43.430
-I-I-I will, but I-I don't...
-Oh, God, no, they're huge.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.798
And besides, I don't even know
this woman.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.867
Wait, what?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.470
What, do you think that was me
in them pictures?

17:50.503 --> 17:51.938
Don't be stupid.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.773
I was a cook in Korea.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.808
You're Korean?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.944
No, he's saying that he's been
impersonating a stable boy.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.912
-DOTTIE: Leave us alone. -You've
been impersonating her...

18:01.948 --> 18:03.950
-DOTTIE: What the hell
are you doing? -Got to go.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.385
-Go, go.
-Oh, God.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.054
Wait, where are we,
where are we going?

18:08.087 --> 18:12.159
Stretch! You're not leaving me,
are you?

18:12.192 --> 18:13.793
Dottie, you're the best.
I got to go.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.096
:
Oh, Stretch, oh!

18:27.039 --> 18:29.909
EDDIE: I knew I wouldn't
have long there.

18:29.942 --> 18:34.281
They'd either call the cops
on me or have her committed.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.115
I figured we may as well have

18:36.149 --> 18:39.752
as good a time as we had
while we could.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.188
I love a feel-good story about,
you know,

18:41.221 --> 18:44.157
senile women and squatting.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.193
You want to be
in the rodeo business, Baskets?

18:46.226 --> 18:49.128
There's one thing
you got to know first.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.765
Don't do business
with Jim Jack Mahoney.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.368
That's good advice. Martha,
you should write this down.

19:02.175 --> 19:05.144
Well, I hope this isn't
a bathroom break.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.880
I was hoping to get
a frappuccino at the same time.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.483
Well, there's an outdoor couch
you can urinate on.

19:12.319 --> 19:16.323
-Chip, he's pulling a gun out of
his pants. -I see that, Martha.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.625
Well, I tell you this, pal, I'm
not gonna leave empty-handed.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.560
I'm not gonna take one of your
used toothbrushes or anything.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.728
I'm gonna take something
of value.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.197
Well, all sales are final.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.700
Hello, Eddie.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.836
Jim Jack.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.272
May I make a request?

19:33.540 --> 19:38.077
We leave the flat screen
out of this.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.347
It smells like urine
in here already.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.348
Do you pee in this car?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.390
Now we're even,
Jim Jack Mahoney!

19:50.423 --> 19:52.425
Mother trucker!

19:56.529 --> 19:58.331
Chip, did you see that?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.032
What, Dale?

20:00.066 --> 20:04.003
No, it was... I think
that's a smart TV.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.773
All right, Jim Jack Mahoney
feels bad

20:06.806 --> 20:10.176
about that string
of shithead horses now

20:10.209 --> 20:13.112
'cause I shot his home all up.

20:13.145 --> 20:17.116
I'll see you folks
back at the rodeo.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.051
-Okay. Thanks, Eddie.

20:19.085 --> 20:22.555
MARTHA:
I can't believe we made it

20:22.589 --> 20:24.023
out there alive.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.725
I thought I was gonna meet
my maker.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.094
And I'm stronger for it.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.897
Just wish I had had some
of that popcorn, you know?

20:34.901 --> 20:39.205
Man, the air sure
is clear out here.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.873
What are you doing?

20:40.907 --> 20:43.410
What, you got to pee alfresco
or something?

20:43.443 --> 20:46.212
No. See that hill over there?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.081
-Yeah.
-That shepherd I told you about,

20:49.115 --> 20:51.584
he works in the field
right over the hill.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.953
Huh.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.823
-No, this is dumb.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.090
You want to talk to him?

20:58.124 --> 20:59.326
-Go talk to him.
-No.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.493
No, you were right.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.894
He's not my boyfriend.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.663
He probably doesn't
even remember me.

21:03.696 --> 21:07.734
Martha...

21:07.767 --> 21:09.402
...look, I'm wrong.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.438
I-I...

21:11.471 --> 21:13.306
You should listen
to your signals.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.074
I'm not good at picking up
on those things.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.909
You're good at it.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.745
And, by the way,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.112
you're very memorable, very.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.248
-Yeah, you have a green cast.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.652
I mean, people remember
that kind of stuff.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.355
Plus you have a...

21:28.388 --> 21:31.991
you have a sweetness to you.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.293
-Well... okay.
-Go.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.463
-Thanks, Chip. All right.
-Go live your life.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.799
I will give it a shot.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.553
Why did you lie
and tell that guy
you had a boyfriend?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.287
I do have a boyfriend.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.089
Actually, I have two.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.794
I'm not one of 'em,
right?

23:14.827 --> 23:16.295
Baskets.

Family is everything.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.538
I grew up
in the south of France.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.373
My mother
was a dressmaker.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.876
My father was
a Philippine general.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.579
The first dress I ever made
was for my sister.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.246
I have a doctorate
from Yale.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.982
I design
from the heart.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.750
I build ocean liners.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.719
Art...

23:39.752 --> 23:41.554
is the passion
of my life.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.690
When I see
something I want...

23:44.691 --> 23:46.092
I take it.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.394
