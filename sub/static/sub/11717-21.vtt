That's your father.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.481
For you, baby.

00:52.020 --> 00:53.053
Gotten so big.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.292
I got you something.

01:01.196 --> 01:02.729
I see you brought
some friends.

01:02.781 --> 01:04.415
Just a precaution.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.304
So have you and your Mommy
found any seashells yet?

01:13.258 --> 01:16.576
It's a lot different
from home, ain't it?

01:16.628 --> 01:18.245
Bet you're having fun.

01:18.313 --> 01:19.580
I saw a dolphin.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.415
You did?
Yeah.

01:21.466 --> 01:22.750
Where?

01:25.220 --> 01:28.105
Well, maybe later we could
go swim with that dolphin.

01:28.173 --> 01:29.606
Okay.

01:32.961 --> 01:35.129
I missed you so much.

01:35.196 --> 01:38.098
I missed you, too.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.340
LISA:

01:48.009 --> 01:50.444
you've been undercover
for almost two years.

01:50.512 --> 01:51.845
It's almost over.

01:56.017 --> 01:59.219
Your son didn't even
recognize you, Reggie.

02:01.256 --> 02:04.591
Nobody's ever been this close
to getting this guy, Lisa.

02:04.659 --> 02:08.429
Which just puts you
in even more danger.

02:08.496 --> 02:12.866
I mean, why does
it have to be you?

02:12.934 --> 02:14.535
What, the FBI couldn't find

02:14.602 --> 02:17.271
one New York detective
that doesn't have a family?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.706
I want my family back.

02:19.774 --> 02:22.376
I just need a little
bit more time for us

02:22.444 --> 02:24.445
to close this case.
Then I'm home for good.

02:25.814 --> 02:27.915
I'm scared, Reggie.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.350
I love you, and I'm scared.

02:33.054 --> 02:34.705
Come here.
Don't be scared.

02:34.789 --> 02:36.990
Everything's going
to be all right.

We got to move, all right?

03:39.287 --> 03:40.287
Okay?

03:43.074 --> 03:44.942
(cries out)
Damn it.

03:49.097 --> 03:50.948
Kevin, listen to me.

03:51.032 --> 03:52.366
I want you to go in your room.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.750
You stay there till
Daddy gets back, okay?

03:53.835 --> 03:54.935

Oh, no joke, brother.

Kamekona no welch.

Had that little punk

you would've been taking me to

05:32.801 --> 05:36.337
Potato frittatas

05:36.404 --> 05:37.448
Okay, so everything you're
going to cook for me

05:37.473 --> 05:39.607
this week, is it going
to have Spam in it?

05:39.608 --> 05:40.450
Of course.

05:40.475 --> 05:42.376
It's the Hawaiian steak,
the nectar of the islands.

05:42.444 --> 05:43.711
Do you know what's in Spam?

05:43.778 --> 05:45.062
I'll tell you.

05:45.147 --> 05:47.148
It's processed
pork parts, salt,

05:47.215 --> 05:48.749
and meat stock.

05:48.817 --> 05:52.019
That's what give
'em the glaze.

05:52.087 --> 05:54.455

I don't want to taste.

05:56.158 --> 05:58.259
No?

05:58.326 --> 06:00.928
KAMEKONA:
What's the matter?

06:02.564 --> 06:03.831
Did you see who
delivered this?

06:03.899 --> 06:05.499
Wasn't there when I came in.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.384
Somebody must've
slipped it under

06:07.469 --> 06:09.470
the door while I was
in the kitchen.

06:14.176 --> 06:17.611
Somebody send you
pictures of a car wreck?

06:17.679 --> 06:23.250
This is the car bomb
that killed my mother.

06:23.318 --> 06:24.952
These are crime scene

06:25.020 --> 06:26.954
from my father's toolbox
a few months ago.

06:27.022 --> 06:29.757
And now they're
sending it back?

06:29.824 --> 06:31.725

09:28.603 --> 09:30.070
I'm going to get you some
answers, I promise.

09:30.138 --> 09:33.407
I want you to go with Officer
Liko, and she's going to take

09:33.475 --> 09:35.259
really good care of you. I'm
going to see you soon, okay?

09:35.343 --> 09:36.927
I'm going to be

09:37.011 --> 09:39.596
Look, be a good
boy for her.

09:39.681 --> 09:41.715
All right?

09:44.185 --> 09:46.553
Hey.

09:46.621 --> 09:50.107
Got this off our
wounded man inside.

09:50.191 --> 09:51.525
It's FBI.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.860
FBI?
Yeah.

09:52.927 --> 09:53.977
CHIN:
Special Agent Art Newman.

09:54.062 --> 09:55.195
The dead vic we found
in the back's

09:55.263 --> 09:58.482
also FBI. Martin Stallworth.

09:58.566 --> 10:00.951
They're both based out of New
York. Organized Crime Unit.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.537
All right, but what about Kevin's father?
KONO: His name

10:03.605 --> 10:05.622
is Reggie Cole.
All he had on him was

10:05.707 --> 10:06.990
was a New York driver's license.
Something's missing.

10:07.075 --> 10:08.275
Yeah. Answers.

10:08.343 --> 10:10.110
Looks like we're about
to get some.

10:12.380 --> 10:13.630
You Five-O?

10:13.715 --> 10:15.615
Yeah, I'm Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.835
Special Agent Allison Marsh.

10:17.919 --> 10:20.854
I'm told Reggie Cole
survived the attack.

10:20.922 --> 10:23.056
Yeah, he did.
Along with his young son.

10:23.124 --> 10:24.641
Uh, unfortunately his wife

10:24.726 --> 10:27.227
suffered a fatal
gunshot wound to the chest.

10:27.295 --> 10:29.062
Any idea who
the shooters might be?

10:29.130 --> 10:31.648
Reggie Cole has been working
undercover for the FBI

10:31.733 --> 10:35.602
in Jimmy Cannon's
New York crime family.

10:35.653 --> 10:36.870
We're running
our people now.

10:36.938 --> 10:39.807
We have no idea how this
happened. But obviously,

10:39.874 --> 10:42.176
Cannon found out Reggie's
identity and sent a crew

10:42.243 --> 10:43.410
to wipe out him
and his family.

10:43.478 --> 10:44.845
I'm sorry.
Who's Jimmy Cannon?

10:44.913 --> 10:47.080
I used to be a cop
in New Jersey.

10:47.148 --> 10:48.515
Jimmy Cannon:
you used to hear

10:48.583 --> 10:50.117
his name all the time.
Guns, drugs, labor,

10:50.168 --> 10:51.785
uh, construction,
hijacking,

10:51.853 --> 10:54.922
anything; you name it.
Jimmy Cannon was coming to Oahu

10:54.989 --> 10:57.458
to visit his son Richard,
a civilian with no connection

10:57.509 --> 10:58.659
to his dad's
business.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.061
Works for the preservation
society here.

11:01.129 --> 11:03.046
So Reggie came in a
day ahead of Cannon

11:03.131 --> 11:06.683
to set up security
detail, but he wanted

11:06.768 --> 11:08.668
a breakaway to see
his wife and son.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.522
No one was supposed to know.

11:11.606 --> 11:13.140
Cannon obviously figured it out.

11:13.191 --> 11:14.741
That's what I think.
All right, listen,

11:14.809 --> 11:16.560
if Cannon finds out
that Reggie's not dead,

11:16.644 --> 11:18.479
he's gonna send men in
to finish the job.

11:18.546 --> 11:19.980
Gentlemen,
this is an FBI matter now,

11:20.048 --> 11:21.482
and the FBI will be taking over

11:21.533 --> 11:23.116
this case. Thank you
for your efforts.

11:23.184 --> 11:24.368
First of all, you're welcome.

11:24.452 --> 11:26.403
Second of all,
a little boy's gonna grow up

11:26.488 --> 11:28.021
without a mother
because of a leak

11:28.072 --> 11:29.206
in your agency.

11:29.290 --> 11:30.457
You listen to me.

11:30.525 --> 11:32.226
You cannot go after
Jimmy Cannon.

11:32.293 --> 11:34.294
Watch me.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.603
Reggie? Hey.
I'm Steve McGarrett.

11:47.654 --> 11:48.771
Where's my son?

11:48.838 --> 11:49.989
He's okay.

11:50.073 --> 11:51.840
Uh, your wife's parents
are flying in.

11:51.908 --> 11:53.142
You didn't answer my question.

11:53.209 --> 11:54.493
Where's my son?

11:54.578 --> 11:56.629
He's down the hall.
We have people with him.

11:56.713 --> 11:58.447
Who, the Feds?
No.

11:58.498 --> 12:00.165
Our people-- HPD.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.483
Listen, I know you don't

12:01.551 --> 12:02.951
trust anybody
after what happened.

12:03.003 --> 12:04.119
You're right, I don't.

12:04.187 --> 12:05.287
Okay, we understand that,

12:05.338 --> 12:06.455
but we do have
to ask you some questions.

12:06.523 --> 12:08.007
There were two shooters.
It was dark.

12:08.091 --> 12:10.125
I didn't see their faces.

12:10.193 --> 12:12.294
After my wife...

12:15.865 --> 12:18.300
After I saw my wife
on the ground, I fired,

12:18.368 --> 12:21.670
you know,
then they fired.

12:21.738 --> 12:23.205
I hit one of them,
and then they drove off.

12:23.273 --> 12:24.974
Are you sure you hit him?

12:25.041 --> 12:27.209
I hit him.

12:27.277 --> 12:30.863
Reggie, how many people knew
that you and your family

12:30.947 --> 12:32.698
were going to be
in that house?

12:32.782 --> 12:34.833
My supervising agent.

12:34.918 --> 12:36.919
Three agents on detail.

12:39.222 --> 12:42.358
Very few people
in FBI know I exist.

12:44.027 --> 12:46.662
Okay, well, one
of those people had to leak

12:46.730 --> 12:48.130
the location of
your safe house.

12:48.181 --> 12:50.065
Look, my job was
to get Jimmy Cannon.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.533
I don't know who shot me,

12:51.601 --> 12:53.702
I don't know
who set me up. All I know is

12:53.770 --> 12:55.220
that Jimmy Cannon
ordered the hit.

12:55.305 --> 12:56.505
Now, look, look, I know

12:56.573 --> 12:58.474
you guys are trying
to do your jobs,

12:58.525 --> 13:02.361
but Jimmy Cannon killed my wife.

13:02.445 --> 13:04.446
He killed a federal agent.

13:04.514 --> 13:06.281
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

13:06.349 --> 13:09.685
He's going to put walls up
in front of you wherever you go.

13:09.753 --> 13:11.487
We're gonna go
wherever the case takes us.

13:11.554 --> 13:13.422
And let me tell you,
you want guys like us

13:13.490 --> 13:15.257
on this, because we'll go
right through those walls.

13:15.325 --> 13:17.059
You understand?

13:17.127 --> 13:18.894
I wasn't supposed
to leave that house.

13:18.962 --> 13:21.830
Jimmy's gonna
try again.

13:21.898 --> 13:23.932
I got to protect my son.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.368
I'm all he has.

13:33.927 --> 13:35.678
Hey, how's Reggie?
Reggie's fine.

13:35.745 --> 13:37.596
Tangential gunshot wound
to the liver,

13:37.681 --> 13:39.214
so he's gonna need
a little time.

13:39.282 --> 13:40.349
Tangential?
Williams, you don't have

13:40.417 --> 13:42.401
to bust out the big words
to impress me.

13:42.485 --> 13:44.570
That's very cute.
Your turn. What do you got?

13:44.654 --> 13:47.356
Uh, I got evidence
of two shooters.

13:47.407 --> 13:48.991
Two shoot... Yeah, that just
confirms what Reggie said,

13:49.059 --> 13:50.259
so I'm not impressed with it.

13:50.326 --> 13:54.263
Okay, well, what if
I told you I found a witness?

13:54.330 --> 13:55.447
Would that work?

13:55.532 --> 13:56.699
That would blow my mind.

13:56.766 --> 13:59.068
See that camera?

13:59.135 --> 14:01.804
Yeah.
There are two dozen of these around

14:01.871 --> 14:03.605
the preserve to stop
illegal spear fishing.

14:03.673 --> 14:05.340
This one's facing
our crime scene.

14:05.408 --> 14:07.376
Okay, how do you know
about these?

14:07.427 --> 14:09.178
Oh, when I was in high school,

14:09.245 --> 14:11.580
some friends and I got
suspended being filmed up here,

14:11.631 --> 14:13.749
allegedly drinking and
night surfing. Allegedly.

14:13.817 --> 14:15.050
Hmm.
So, these cameras--

14:15.118 --> 14:16.318
they use a motion
detection system.

14:16.386 --> 14:18.270
So, the tape rolls

14:18.354 --> 14:20.422
whenever there's any movement
in the field or on the road.

14:20.473 --> 14:22.024
All right, I'm gonna
call the Parks Department

14:22.091 --> 14:24.143
and get somebody down here now.
Ah, forget that.

14:24.227 --> 14:26.195
I got it.
What are you doing?

14:34.671 --> 14:35.838
Spider Woman, what
are you doing?

14:35.905 --> 14:37.172
I got 'em on speed dial, baby.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.042
You don't got... Would
you be careful, please?

14:40.744 --> 14:42.110
Would you stop?

14:44.147 --> 14:45.481
That's nice.

14:45.548 --> 14:48.183
(clanging)

14:48.251 --> 14:51.670
Destruction of government
property. That...

14:51.755 --> 14:53.889
You've been hanging out
with McGarrett too long.

15:00.263 --> 15:02.014
Kev.

15:04.901 --> 15:06.969
I was so worried
about you.

15:10.607 --> 15:12.541
I love you.

15:12.609 --> 15:14.610
You know that,
don't you?

15:15.829 --> 15:17.980
Love you so much.

15:20.083 --> 15:23.385
Are you going to catch
the men who hurt Mommy?

15:25.421 --> 15:27.489
(sighs)

15:27.557 --> 15:29.825
Yes, I am.

15:32.762 --> 15:34.229
(crying)

15:34.297 --> 15:36.465
(sighs)

15:41.554 --> 15:43.539
STEVE:
<i>So what you get off the camera?</i>

15:43.606 --> 15:46.308
KONO: We got a Ford Explorer
pulling up to the house

15:46.376 --> 15:48.227
just before dawn, lights off.

15:48.311 --> 15:49.578
They go into
the house...

15:51.114 --> 15:53.816
...and they come out
two minutes later.

15:53.883 --> 15:56.685
Okay, Reggie said he hit
one of those guys.

15:56.753 --> 15:58.904
Yeah, he
did, right...

16:00.557 --> 16:02.541
Right there.

16:04.828 --> 16:08.263
All right, run the tape back,
Kono. Run it back a bit.

16:08.331 --> 16:10.032
Okay, freeze it.
Right there.

16:11.734 --> 16:14.236
All right, get the Crime Lab
back to the scene and look

16:14.304 --> 16:16.171
for any evidence around where
that Explorer was, okay?

16:16.222 --> 16:17.673
And then check
with hospitals and clinics

16:17.740 --> 16:19.091
for any reports
of gunshot wounds.

16:19.209 --> 16:21.109
All right. I already have
an APB out on the vehicle.

16:21.177 --> 16:23.412
We're gonna need a better look
at those faces in this video.

16:23.479 --> 16:26.014
Uh, it's pretty grainy,
but I can try cleaning them up.

16:26.082 --> 16:27.683
All right, when you get
something, run 'em against

16:27.750 --> 16:29.318
all known members
of the Cannon's organization

16:29.385 --> 16:30.953
who are actually
in the database, okay?

16:31.020 --> 16:32.571
What about the boot print

16:32.655 --> 16:34.439
you pulled at
the crime scene?

16:34.524 --> 16:36.441
Sole treads are mass-produced
and sold all over the world,

16:36.526 --> 16:38.760
so unless we have a suspect's
shoes to match them to,

16:38.828 --> 16:40.095
it's a dead end.

16:40.163 --> 16:41.296
Hey.

16:41.364 --> 16:42.764
Hey. Just spoke with the M.E.

16:42.832 --> 16:44.499
The slugs he pulled
out of the vics

16:44.567 --> 16:45.617
were made of
tungsten steel.

16:45.702 --> 16:46.919
Now, these are
the same exact bullets

16:47.003 --> 16:48.770
that were used
in a handful of New York murders

16:48.838 --> 16:49.905
that the Feds believe,

16:49.973 --> 16:52.407
but can't prove, Cannon ordered.

16:52.475 --> 16:53.709
How is this guy not in jail?

16:53.776 --> 16:57.813
Well, lack of
evidence, for starters.

16:58.781 --> 17:00.599
Where are you going?

17:00.683 --> 17:02.751
To get some evidence.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.569
Hey, McGarrett,
Williams. Five-O.

17:20.619 --> 17:22.204
We're here to see,
uh, Jimmy Cannon.

17:22.271 --> 17:24.473
Mr. Cannon
isn't seeing any visitors today.

17:24.540 --> 17:27.041
Why don't you guys
go get some lunch?

17:32.682 --> 17:33.615
You can come back tomorrow.

17:33.666 --> 17:36.318
Thank you very much.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.721
Thank you very much?
Yeah.

17:39.789 --> 17:41.546
You heard him. Mr. Cannon's
not seeing any visitors.

17:41.571 --> 17:42.771
Hmm.

17:42.959 --> 17:46.295
Oh, please don't do that.
What?

17:46.362 --> 17:47.930
Put both your hands
on the wheel.

17:47.997 --> 17:49.831
Every time you do that,
something terrible happens,

17:49.899 --> 17:51.149
and I have to pray. Please?

17:51.234 --> 17:53.035
Just hang on a second.
Wait! Wait!

17:54.604 --> 17:56.838
Okay.

17:56.906 --> 17:58.941
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

18:03.746 --> 18:05.163
Jimmy Cannon?

18:05.248 --> 18:07.683
Who the hell are you?

18:07.750 --> 18:10.686
If you have to ask, your
reputation is exaggerated,

18:10.753 --> 18:11.920
or you're slipping.
I'm Steve McGarrett.

18:11.988 --> 18:13.255
This is Detective
Danny Williams.

18:13.322 --> 18:14.506
Hey, big guy, I got
one of those, too.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.491
You want to play?
We could play,

18:16.542 --> 18:17.759
or you can
walk away.

18:17.827 --> 18:19.511
Uh, it's all right.
It's all right.

18:19.595 --> 18:23.699
DANNY: Listen, we would
have knocked, but

18:23.766 --> 18:25.100
had a little trouble
with the gate.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.769
Gentlemen, I get
to see my son about once a year.

18:27.837 --> 18:30.872
So, whatever this is about,
make it quick. Richard,

18:30.940 --> 18:32.040
go inside.
Richard,

18:32.108 --> 18:33.341
you should stay there
if you want to find out

18:33.393 --> 18:34.476
who your father
really is.

18:34.527 --> 18:35.727
You trying to tell me
who my father is?

18:35.812 --> 18:37.045
He's <i>my</i> father.

18:37.113 --> 18:39.281
Oh, that's deep. Jimmy,

18:39.348 --> 18:41.450
hey, uh, did
you really think

18:41.517 --> 18:43.201
you were going to get away
with killing a Federal Agent

18:43.286 --> 18:45.754
and the wife
of a New York City detective?

18:45.822 --> 18:47.322
What are you talking about?

18:47.373 --> 18:48.957
STEVE: I'll tell you what
he's talking about.

18:49.025 --> 18:50.392
Reggie Cole was undercover

18:50.460 --> 18:51.827
in your operation
for two years.

18:51.894 --> 18:53.695
Somebody leaked that
information to you,

18:53.763 --> 18:56.264
and you gave the order for him
and his family to be killed.

18:56.332 --> 18:57.933
A woman and a
nine-year-old boy.

18:58.001 --> 19:01.202
I have nothing to do
with this terrible crime.

19:01.254 --> 19:03.872
And if Reggie Cole is dead,

19:03.923 --> 19:05.340
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:05.391 --> 19:07.392
DANNY:
No. See, this is

19:07.477 --> 19:09.377
in the bad news
for Jimmy department.

19:09.429 --> 19:11.113
Uh, Reggie Cole survived.

19:11.180 --> 19:13.715
I don't keep tabs
on my employees

19:13.783 --> 19:15.484
when they're not working.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.404
Now...

19:19.489 --> 19:21.823
if Reggie pretended
to be someone he's not,

19:21.891 --> 19:24.893
made people love him,
and then betrayed those people,

19:24.944 --> 19:26.661
I can understand

19:26.729 --> 19:30.298
why someone would want
to hurt the family he loves.

19:30.366 --> 19:33.602
On the streets
where I grew up on,

19:33.669 --> 19:36.621
some folk would
consider that justice.

19:36.706 --> 19:39.941
You know, I can't wait to wipe
that stupid smile off your face.

19:41.477 --> 19:44.262
I think I'll exercise my right
to remain silent.

19:44.347 --> 19:45.914
That's what guilty people do.

19:45.965 --> 19:48.016
That's what smart people do.
DANNY: Well, see, if you were

19:48.084 --> 19:49.351
that smart, we never
would have made it in here.

19:49.418 --> 19:53.021
And if you had any evidence,
we wouldn't be talking.

19:53.089 --> 19:55.857
This is a photograph
of a tungsten-tip steel bullet.

19:55.925 --> 19:58.193
Your signature.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.461
We found that at
the Cole crime scene.

19:59.529 --> 20:01.096
Now you getting sloppy, Jimmy,
or what?

20:01.147 --> 20:03.365
You know,

20:03.432 --> 20:06.267
every investigation ever
launched against me

20:06.319 --> 20:08.203
has come up empty. You know why?
No. Why?

20:08.271 --> 20:09.704
Because there's nothing to find.

20:11.207 --> 20:13.075
Now, growing up in poverty

20:13.142 --> 20:15.327
and making something of yourself
used to be considered

20:15.411 --> 20:16.878
a virtue in this country.

20:16.946 --> 20:19.114
Was that Capone?
Did he just quote Capone?

20:19.165 --> 20:20.449
I think it was Gotti.
Right, Gotti?

20:20.516 --> 20:22.283
John Gotti? Is
that John Gotti?

20:22.335 --> 20:23.652
Are you two done?
'Cause I'd like

20:23.753 --> 20:25.220
to get back
to lunch with my son.

20:25.287 --> 20:26.505
That's fair enough.

20:26.589 --> 20:28.173
You only see him once a year.

20:28.257 --> 20:29.975
Can I have one of these?

20:30.059 --> 20:31.292
You know what?

20:31.344 --> 20:32.894
Before we go,

20:32.962 --> 20:35.230
I'm going to need your shoes.

20:37.934 --> 20:39.868
Let me guess.

20:39.936 --> 20:41.136
Cannon's shoes?

20:41.204 --> 20:43.738
Yeah, and,
uh, and all

20:43.806 --> 20:45.107
his bodyguards'.

20:45.174 --> 20:48.410
All right, I'll run them
against the prints at the scene.

20:48.477 --> 20:50.245
That's one of our shooters?
Yeah.

20:50.312 --> 20:52.814
So, I contacted FBI's
Organized Crime Task Force

20:52.865 --> 20:53.865
and had them
send me mug shots

20:53.950 --> 20:55.483
of every known
Cannon associate.

20:55.535 --> 20:57.152
I ran them against
our enhanced image,

20:57.203 --> 20:58.720
but no matches.

20:58.788 --> 21:01.790
Maybe Reggie can ID him.

21:06.963 --> 21:09.598
Hey, Reggie, we need your help.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.100
He's gone.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.855
No one's seen Reggie.
What about Kevin?

21:17.923 --> 21:20.190
Grandparents just picked him
up with a protection detail

21:20.258 --> 21:21.325
right when
we got here.

21:21.393 --> 21:23.110
All right, lock down
the hospital, have HPD

21:23.194 --> 21:24.295
block off
every access street.

21:24.362 --> 21:25.779
Nobody leaves.

21:25.864 --> 21:26.931
What do you got?
Sir,

21:26.998 --> 21:28.399
doctor's office broken into,

21:28.450 --> 21:29.967
and some clothes are missing.
Also got a report

21:29.985 --> 21:31.081
of a Jeep Cherokee stolen
from the parking lot.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.032
He's on E & E.

21:32.037 --> 21:34.622
Okay, issue an APB on Reggie
Cole and the stolen vehicle.

21:34.706 --> 21:36.106
Let's go.
DANNY: Okay, hold on.

21:36.157 --> 21:37.774
Hold on. He's hurt, he
doesn't know the island.

21:37.826 --> 21:38.893
How far can he get?

21:38.960 --> 21:40.294
He survived undercover

21:40.378 --> 21:43.113
in one of the most violent crime
families in the country, Danny.

21:43.181 --> 21:44.615
They killed his wife, okay?

21:44.683 --> 21:47.217
Right now he's focused on
protecting his son and revenge.

21:47.285 --> 21:49.253
The question is--
where does he start?

21:49.304 --> 21:50.454
Well, he's a cop.

21:50.505 --> 21:52.489
My guess-- he starts
at the crime scene.

22:00.815 --> 22:02.433
STEVE: Clear?
OFFICER: Clear.

22:02.484 --> 22:05.102
Where is he?
He just left. Took our car.

22:05.170 --> 22:08.305
And he took something
from the wall back there.

22:09.324 --> 22:10.658
Steve?

22:10.742 --> 22:11.508
What?

22:11.576 --> 22:13.160
So, he ditched the dark clothes,

22:13.244 --> 22:14.811
and check this out.

22:14.863 --> 22:16.680
I think this could be

22:16.748 --> 22:17.948
a crash kit.

22:18.016 --> 22:19.283
What is that?

22:19.351 --> 22:20.884
Crash kit.
It's like

22:20.952 --> 22:22.052
a stash box, right?

22:22.120 --> 22:23.587
Heavy undercovers usually
stow things away

22:23.655 --> 22:25.155
in case their cover is blown,

22:25.223 --> 22:27.841
got to break out quick.
Untraceable IDs

22:27.926 --> 22:29.226
their bosses
don't even know about.

22:29.294 --> 22:32.162
Cash, credit cards, and, uh...

22:32.213 --> 22:33.897
A clean gun.

22:33.965 --> 22:36.467
Yeah. Things just keep
getting better, huh?

22:36.518 --> 22:38.002
Yeah.

22:38.069 --> 22:41.138
HPD just tried to activate
the vehicle locator

22:41.189 --> 22:42.906
on the stolen squad car.
It's not working.

22:42.974 --> 22:45.075
All right, increase
the number of HPD officers

22:45.143 --> 22:46.527
sitting on Cannon's house

22:46.611 --> 22:48.679
in case Reggie decides
to pay a visit.

22:56.854 --> 22:59.123
Hey, Kevin.

22:59.190 --> 23:01.241
Look, I know this is hard...

23:03.628 --> 23:05.763
...but did you see
any of these men

23:05.830 --> 23:07.831
at your house
last night?

23:09.267 --> 23:11.735
My dad said I'm not supposed
to help the police.

23:16.091 --> 23:18.042
Well...

23:18.109 --> 23:22.246
you know how your dad's sort of
a special police officer?

23:22.313 --> 23:24.114
Yes.

23:24.182 --> 23:27.284
I'm special police, too.

23:27.352 --> 23:30.054
What kind of police are you?

23:32.957 --> 23:36.226
Kevin, sometimes moms get hurt,

23:36.294 --> 23:38.429
and I'm the kind of police

23:38.496 --> 23:41.899
they send in to find the men
that hurt moms.

23:43.968 --> 23:45.969
And you can help me.

23:48.673 --> 23:52.076
I think your daddy would
really want you to do that.

23:56.114 --> 23:58.148
What do you think?

24:04.222 --> 24:06.156
Do you remember

24:06.224 --> 24:08.492
any of these men?

24:10.528 --> 24:12.529
No?

24:22.323 --> 24:24.475
(gasps)

24:24.542 --> 24:26.076
(loud, shallow breathing)

24:26.127 --> 24:29.213
It's okay, Kevin.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.215
Kevin?

24:31.282 --> 24:33.484
I saw him.

24:36.488 --> 24:39.223
You're sure?

24:39.290 --> 24:41.625
Nobody else?

24:46.030 --> 24:47.931
(sniffles)
Thank you, Kevin.

24:47.999 --> 24:49.516
You did really good.

24:49.601 --> 24:50.768
(crying)

24:50.835 --> 24:52.035
You did really good.

24:52.103 --> 24:54.037
(sniffling)

24:55.940 --> 24:57.858
STEVE:
<i>Reggie Cole is</i>

24:57.942 --> 24:59.409
a highly decorated
police officer.

24:59.477 --> 25:01.078
And he knows the only reason

25:01.145 --> 25:03.530
Jimmy Cannon has survived
this whole time is because

25:03.615 --> 25:05.199
he doesn't leave anybody alive

25:05.283 --> 25:06.917
who wants to hurt
him, and right now,

25:06.985 --> 25:08.418
Reggie and his
son are two people

25:08.486 --> 25:10.153
who can hurt Jimmy Cannon.
All right, listen.

25:10.205 --> 25:11.488
We know who Jimmy Cannon is.

25:11.539 --> 25:12.990
All right, what we do not know

25:13.057 --> 25:14.708
is who Reggie Cole
is going to be

25:14.793 --> 25:16.343
if he finds out
who the leak is,

25:16.427 --> 25:17.995
or if tracks down one
of the shooters.

25:18.062 --> 25:19.096
Oh, you were married,
you have a daughter.

25:19.163 --> 25:20.264
What would you do?

25:20.331 --> 25:21.682
I would like to just
kill everybody,

25:21.766 --> 25:23.133
but I would never do that, okay?

25:23.184 --> 25:25.552
I would not risk going to
prison. I could not do that

25:25.637 --> 25:26.837
to Grace. You-- forget it.

25:26.888 --> 25:28.839
I don't even want to know
what you would do.

25:28.890 --> 25:30.357
I would be by the book.

25:30.441 --> 25:31.859
The-the book?

25:31.943 --> 25:33.227
I would be by the book.

25:33.311 --> 25:36.613
Which book would that be,
may I ask? Huh?

25:36.681 --> 25:39.283
<i>The Patriot Act for Dummies?</i>
Hmm?

25:39.350 --> 25:40.284
<i>How to Nuke Your Enemies?</i>

25:40.351 --> 25:41.552
<i>War and Peace?</i>
(phone rings)

25:41.619 --> 25:43.737
Minus the peace part?
It's funny.

25:43.822 --> 25:45.055
Hey, Kevin give
us anything?

25:45.123 --> 25:46.206
He saw it all go down.

25:46.291 --> 25:47.524
He recognized our shooter

25:47.575 --> 25:49.209
from the surveillance video,
but he couldn't ID

25:49.294 --> 25:50.744
any of the FBI's known
Cannon associates.

25:50.829 --> 25:53.030
Then who did Cannon
use to pull the trigger?

25:53.097 --> 25:54.965
I don't know. Maybe the shooters
are new hires?

25:55.032 --> 25:56.717
Nuh-uh. No, no, no, no,
Cannon would never do that.

25:56.801 --> 25:58.602
All right, he wouldn't
expose himself like that.

25:58.670 --> 26:00.003
He's too smart.

26:00.054 --> 26:01.305
That's why nobody's ever
been able to put him away.

26:01.372 --> 26:03.240
Any luck connecting the shoes
that we brought in

26:03.308 --> 26:04.441
with the prints
we pulled off the crime scene?

26:04.509 --> 26:05.876
No. No matches.

26:05.927 --> 26:08.395
Think I just figured out how
Cannon knew where Reggie was.

26:08.479 --> 26:09.763
DANNY:
Okay, how?

26:09.848 --> 26:12.316
All right, so the FBI
assigned a three-man detail

26:12.383 --> 26:13.784
to Cole, right?

26:13.852 --> 26:16.386
They were Agents Stallworth,
Newman and Marsh.

26:16.437 --> 26:18.405
But there were only
two of them--

26:18.489 --> 26:19.606
Agents Newman and Stallworth--

26:19.691 --> 26:21.959
who were present
at the time of the attack.

26:22.026 --> 26:24.328
Allison Marsh, the
one who briefed you,

26:24.395 --> 26:26.930
was absent last night due
to a family emergency.

26:26.998 --> 26:28.231
Family emergency.

26:28.283 --> 26:29.416
Anybody else
find that convenient?

26:29.500 --> 26:30.834
That's exactly what I thought.

26:30.902 --> 26:32.836
According to her supervisor,

26:32.904 --> 26:34.788
she's the one who was supposed
to log in any changes

26:34.873 --> 26:37.124
to his protection detail,
which she didn't.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.976
Looks like we found our leak.

26:44.444 --> 26:47.480
Look, I told you,
I had a family emergency.

26:47.548 --> 26:49.649
You're going to have
to be more specific.

26:49.716 --> 26:51.751
My daughter was sick.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.152
You're lying. Badly.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.554
I'm not lying.

26:54.621 --> 26:56.589
How much was Cannon paying you?

26:56.657 --> 27:00.226
You think I'm the leak?

27:00.277 --> 27:01.611
You lost your house
to foreclosure,

27:01.695 --> 27:02.995
which means you need the money.

27:03.063 --> 27:04.146
You had an emergency

27:04.231 --> 27:05.565
a few hours
before the shooting

27:05.616 --> 27:07.433
of a family you were supposed
to be protecting,

27:07.484 --> 27:09.735
and now you're lying to me.
Yeah, I think you're the leak.

27:09.786 --> 27:12.038
I lost my house

27:12.105 --> 27:15.491
because my ex-husband stopped
paying alimony two years ago.

27:15.576 --> 27:17.109
Okay, so you need money
desperately.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.511
I want to talk to your boss.

27:18.545 --> 27:20.413
Lady, I answer to God

27:20.480 --> 27:22.748
and to the governor,
neither of whom

27:22.816 --> 27:26.586
are going to help you out
right now, so take a seat.

27:36.096 --> 27:38.964
Okay. I lied to you.

27:40.334 --> 27:42.151
My daughter wasn't sick
yesterday.

27:42.235 --> 27:44.503
I know that. Why were you not
at the safe house?

27:44.571 --> 27:46.405
(sighs)

27:46.473 --> 27:49.025
I'm in a bad custody battle,

27:49.109 --> 27:52.144
okay, and I was worried
that my ex was going to try

27:52.212 --> 27:54.113
to take my daughter
out of the country,

27:54.181 --> 27:56.382
so I pulled
a few strings,

27:56.450 --> 27:58.834
and I had him detained
by the local police.

27:58.919 --> 28:00.686
I'm sorry. You framed

28:00.754 --> 28:02.521
your ex-husband?
A misdemeanor.

28:02.589 --> 28:04.990
A misdemeanor, huh?

28:05.042 --> 28:06.842
It was the only way
I could guarantee

28:06.927 --> 28:08.260
that he'd stay in the country.

28:08.328 --> 28:10.396
If I hadn't done that,
he'd be gone today,

28:10.464 --> 28:12.048
and I'd have lost my daughter
forever.

28:12.132 --> 28:13.966
Why did you not have somebody
cover you

28:14.034 --> 28:15.301
at the house?

28:15.369 --> 28:17.370
I just needed a couple hours.

28:17.437 --> 28:19.639
Agent Newman said,

28:19.706 --> 28:21.840
he and Stallworth could handle
things while I was gone.

28:21.892 --> 28:24.410
Agent Newman got shot,
Agent Stallworth is dead.

28:24.478 --> 28:27.196
I can get some pictures
of Reggie Cole's wife...

28:27.280 --> 28:29.115
If I had known
we were compromised,

28:29.182 --> 28:31.250
I never would have left.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.824
People I care about have been

28:38.892 --> 28:40.059
hurt and killed.

28:40.127 --> 28:41.877
(buzzer sounds)

28:41.962 --> 28:43.963
I should have been there.

28:45.465 --> 28:48.734
And I'm going to carry that
with me for the rest of my life.

28:55.475 --> 28:57.710
(buzzer sounds, door opens)

28:57.761 --> 28:59.311
Hi.
Hi.

28:59.379 --> 29:01.180
HPD found the squad car
Reggie took.

29:01.248 --> 29:03.599
It was abandoned
in a parking lot in Pearl City.

29:08.522 --> 29:10.840
Hey!
STEVE: What?

29:10.907 --> 29:13.909
I think I might have figured out
why we couldn't track this guy.

29:13.994 --> 29:16.245
This is the vehicle locator.
You see what it looks like now?

29:16.329 --> 29:17.430
Yeah.
Disabled.

29:17.497 --> 29:19.532
Okay, this is what
I don't understand.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.801
Why would he steal
a police car?

29:21.868 --> 29:24.470
Okay, the car he took
from the hospital was

29:24.538 --> 29:25.471
way less conspicuous. Why?

29:25.539 --> 29:26.872
'Cause he needed something.

29:26.940 --> 29:28.124
He needed...

29:30.210 --> 29:31.910
You think?

29:31.962 --> 29:33.212
Yes, I think.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.281
I definitely think.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.120
Okay, boom, he was on this thing
20 minutes ago.

29:41.188 --> 29:45.925
He ran a 1996 white
Ford Explorer.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.143
Oh, that's the same car

29:47.227 --> 29:49.428
the security cam picked up
leaving the crime scene.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.630
All right, he's got
71 potential candidates.

29:51.698 --> 29:53.466
And then went
to license photos.

29:53.533 --> 29:55.234
(phone ringing)
Yeah, see
if he could find a match

29:55.285 --> 29:58.154
to one of the shooters.

29:58.238 --> 30:00.489
Chin.
CHIN: Steve, Lab got a hit

30:00.574 --> 30:02.541
on the blood sample
of the gunman Reggie shot.

30:02.609 --> 30:05.311
Turns out it's a local resident
by the name of Adin Pukahi.

30:05.378 --> 30:07.112
Okay, there's a reason why
we couldn't link it

30:07.164 --> 30:08.998
to one of Cannon's guys--
he did hire locally.

30:09.082 --> 30:11.283
Okay, wait a minute.
That doesn't make any sense.

30:11.334 --> 30:15.137
Okay, why wouldn't Cannon use
his own people to make this hit?

30:15.222 --> 30:17.973
Listen, run Cole's 71 hits
against a Pukahi, Adin.

30:18.058 --> 30:20.159
Pukahi?
Yeah, Pukahi.

30:20.227 --> 30:22.661
That's who Reggie
was looking for.

30:22.729 --> 30:25.364
All right, I got a hit.
Adin Pukahi.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.766
Address: Waipahu.

30:26.817 --> 30:28.400
Anyone want to bet
that's where he's going?

30:34.908 --> 30:36.342
Here he is. The truck.

30:36.409 --> 30:38.027
Pukahi?

30:38.111 --> 30:40.162
Get out of the
vehicle right now.

30:57.881 --> 30:59.832
Well, we're going to have
a very difficult time

30:59.900 --> 31:01.934
getting him to tell us
who hired him.

31:02.001 --> 31:04.236
Damn it.
All right, we need to call HPD,

31:04.304 --> 31:05.838
and we need tell them
that Reggie Cole is now

31:05.906 --> 31:08.374
wanted for the murder of one
of the men who killed his wife.

31:08.441 --> 31:10.176
(phone ringing)
We got to get
to the second shooter

31:10.243 --> 31:11.861
before Reggie does,

31:11.945 --> 31:13.295
or else we got zero chance
of getting Cannon.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.520
McGarrett.

31:14.564 --> 31:15.531
I didn't kill him.

31:15.615 --> 31:16.649
You hear me?

31:16.700 --> 31:17.733
I didn't kill him.

31:17.818 --> 31:18.851
Yeah.

31:18.902 --> 31:20.219
I want to believe you, Reggie.

31:20.287 --> 31:21.487
Someone else got to Pukahi
before I could question him.

31:21.538 --> 31:22.688
You're asking me

31:22.739 --> 31:24.323
to trust you,
you need to trust us.

31:24.391 --> 31:26.742
All right, you need to turn
yourself in, and then when

31:26.827 --> 31:28.160
we clear you, if we clear you,

31:28.228 --> 31:29.862
we'll work together,
you understand?

31:29.913 --> 31:32.214
I can't do that.
Only have one chance left

31:32.299 --> 31:34.083
to find out how this went down.
Hold up.

31:34.167 --> 31:35.885
Reggie, you got to think
about your kid right now, okay?

31:35.969 --> 31:37.870
Who in the hell do you think
I'm doing this for?

31:37.921 --> 31:40.372
If I don't put an end to this
now, Kevin will never be safe.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.374
Hey, you can't raise your kid

31:42.442 --> 31:43.342
from a prison cell.

31:43.410 --> 31:44.343
STEVE:
Reggie, listen.

31:44.411 --> 31:45.611
I understand.

31:45.679 --> 31:47.179
Believe me, I understand
why you're doing this,

31:47.230 --> 31:49.882
but you've got to let us do
our job, okay? Let us help you.

31:49.933 --> 31:51.383
You got to trust us, Reggie.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.819
Whoever gave Cannon my safe
house and got my wife killed--

31:53.887 --> 31:56.021
they were someone who I trusted.

31:56.089 --> 31:58.357
Let's just say "trust"
isn't my thing right now.

31:58.425 --> 32:01.126
Stay out of my way, McGarrett.

32:01.194 --> 32:02.862
(phone beeps off)

32:02.913 --> 32:04.062
Hold on.

32:04.114 --> 32:05.364
How does he know we're here?

32:05.432 --> 32:07.099
How does he know
we're here?

32:08.668 --> 32:10.502
I'll tell you how
he knows we're here.

32:10.570 --> 32:11.737
He stole the portable radio

32:11.788 --> 32:13.088
from the squad car.

32:13.173 --> 32:15.073
Right, so he could monitor
our calls, track our moves.

32:15.125 --> 32:16.592
And stay one step ahead of the
investigation the whole time.

32:16.676 --> 32:19.411
So, we need to call HPD, radio
silence on the case right now.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.598
Hold up a second.
Wait a minute.

32:22.682 --> 32:26.051
We know he's listening
in on the radio, right?

32:26.102 --> 32:27.286
Well, why go silent?

32:27.354 --> 32:29.087
Why don't we give him something
to listen to?

32:29.139 --> 32:32.257
DISPATCHER:
All units: We have a ten-five
on the second Cole shooter.

32:32.309 --> 32:33.592
Ala Moana Beach Park.

32:33.643 --> 32:34.927
Suspect is armed.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.329
Proceed with caution.

32:37.397 --> 32:38.864
DANNY:
Standing by.

32:40.300 --> 32:42.167
Nobody moves
until I give the order.

32:42.235 --> 32:44.069
You got me?

32:44.137 --> 32:46.488
(garbled police radio
transmission)

32:52.913 --> 32:55.414
CHIN: Raise your hands
and walk back toward my voice.

32:55.482 --> 32:57.149
Do it now, Reggie.

33:01.287 --> 33:04.590
CHIN (over radio):
Yeah, we got him.

33:04.641 --> 33:06.492
(siren blares briefly)

33:15.068 --> 33:17.369
How'd you know I'd be here?

33:17.437 --> 33:19.638
This is where I'd come if I
thought it was gonna be a trap.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.106
It's got the best
vantage point in the park.

33:21.174 --> 33:23.642
Found this on him;
.38 caliber.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.245
M.E. said he pulled
two .38 slugs out of Pukahi.

33:28.114 --> 33:29.381
Get him out of here.

33:29.449 --> 33:31.984
I didn't kill him.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.502
I didn't kill him!

33:33.586 --> 33:38.023
REGGIE:
Pukahi was already dead
when I got here.

33:38.091 --> 33:39.959
You know something,
Reggie, I believe you.

33:40.026 --> 33:41.360
I believe you, man.

33:41.428 --> 33:43.362
And you know what else,
I'm sure that this piece,

33:43.430 --> 33:45.497
loaded with
tungsten-steel bullets

33:45.565 --> 33:48.217
just happened to be in the car
when you stole it, too, right?

33:48.301 --> 33:51.103
I got it out of Pukahi's car,
and I took it for evidence.

33:52.205 --> 33:54.640
I didn't kill anyone.

33:54.691 --> 33:56.241
And neither did Cannon.

34:01.197 --> 34:03.148
What are you talking about?

34:03.216 --> 34:06.552
Jimmy Cannon
didn't kill my wife.

34:11.388 --> 34:13.523
How many times do you want me
to tell you? Jimmy Cannon

34:13.607 --> 34:15.007
did not kill my wife!

34:15.074 --> 34:16.342
Everything points to him.

34:16.409 --> 34:18.277
Okay? He had
the motivation;

34:18.344 --> 34:20.646
he had the means; we found
his signature bullets

34:20.714 --> 34:21.731
at the crime scene, Reggie.

34:21.815 --> 34:23.149
Why don't you
explain that to me!

34:23.199 --> 34:25.184
I was with Jimmy Cannon
every day for two years.

34:25.235 --> 34:27.219
He <i>is</i> a cold-blooded killer,
but he's not gonna trust

34:27.286 --> 34:29.188
some low-level local like Pukahi

34:29.255 --> 34:30.572
for a hit like this.

34:30.657 --> 34:32.525
He has too much access
to major talent.

34:32.576 --> 34:35.078
Somebody set him up.

34:35.161 --> 34:37.413
And whoever set him up
killed Pukahi.

34:37.498 --> 34:39.716
And that's who we need
to be looking for!

34:39.800 --> 34:41.699
Instead of you in here
interrogating me!

34:41.752 --> 34:42.885
My wife's killer's

34:42.969 --> 34:45.036
still out there!
Pukahi was killed with a .38.

34:45.089 --> 34:46.889
I pulled a .38
off of you, Reggie.

34:46.974 --> 34:48.241
What is that,
coincidence?

34:48.308 --> 34:49.942
I didn't say
I wasn't happy he was dead.

34:50.010 --> 34:52.045
I'm happy he's dead.

34:52.112 --> 34:54.213
But I did not pull the trigger.

34:56.016 --> 34:58.217
Look, I'm not gonna leave
my son out here all alone

34:58.268 --> 34:59.685
with nobody to take care of him.

34:59.753 --> 35:03.556
I'm not gonna raise my son
through no prison bars.

35:03.607 --> 35:05.908
McGarrett, do you have kids?

35:05.993 --> 35:07.760
No.

35:07.828 --> 35:09.579
(chuckles, mumbles)

35:09.663 --> 35:11.748
Then you'll never understand.

35:11.832 --> 35:13.433
(buzzer sounds, door opens)

35:14.568 --> 35:16.902
Ballistics report
came back on Pukahi.

35:16.954 --> 35:18.938
.38 slugs don't
match Reggie's gun.

35:19.006 --> 35:20.873
See, I told you--
McGarrett, please,

35:20.941 --> 35:23.607
we are wasting time!

35:23.642 --> 35:24.776
All right, then
who killed him?

35:24.787 --> 35:25.587
Who killed him, huh?

35:25.665 --> 35:26.631
The second shooter?

35:26.784 --> 35:28.018
Whoever hired the second shooter

35:28.235 --> 35:30.311
was trying to silence him,
can't you see that?

35:30.827 --> 35:33.379
Just get me out of here.

35:33.437 --> 35:36.089
I think I know
how to find him.

35:37.357 --> 35:39.275
These are the tungsten bullets

35:39.359 --> 35:40.827
that I found on Pukahi.

35:40.894 --> 35:42.895
Now, look at this.

35:54.291 --> 35:56.826
Full load, right?

35:56.910 --> 35:59.328
Now look at this one.

36:04.685 --> 36:05.784
See anything odd?

36:05.836 --> 36:07.303
It's got half
the gunpowder in it.

36:07.387 --> 36:08.654
Half the power
of a regular bullet.

36:08.755 --> 36:10.640
This is
a full magazine.

36:10.724 --> 36:13.292
If you go to this much trouble
to kill somebody, why would you

36:13.343 --> 36:14.660
use a bullet
at half its force?

36:14.728 --> 36:15.862
Hey, this one's
got a pulse.

36:15.929 --> 36:17.697
You wouldn't,
unless you didn't want

36:17.764 --> 36:18.681
to kill them,

36:18.765 --> 36:20.133
you only wanted
to wound them,

36:20.200 --> 36:23.703
to give them an alibi that
no one would ever question.

36:23.770 --> 36:26.339
You got it.

36:28.358 --> 36:31.694
Thank you for
bringing me in on this.

36:33.330 --> 36:34.780
Reggie,

36:34.848 --> 36:36.115
thank God you're okay.

36:36.183 --> 36:37.283
I'm so sorry

36:37.351 --> 36:38.784
about Lisa.

36:38.852 --> 36:39.869
(yells)

36:39.953 --> 36:41.387
Now, that looks like it hurts,

36:41.455 --> 36:42.655
almost as much

36:42.706 --> 36:43.539
as a gunshot wound

36:43.624 --> 36:45.508
to the collarbone.
Listen,

36:45.592 --> 36:47.043
we know you made
those tungsten bullets, okay?

36:47.127 --> 36:48.127
I have no idea

36:48.195 --> 36:49.195
what you're
talking about.

36:49.263 --> 36:49.862
Shut up.

36:49.930 --> 36:50.863
Half load,
so they...

36:50.931 --> 36:51.864
Hey, look at me!

36:51.932 --> 36:54.016
Half load, so they would wound

36:54.101 --> 36:55.201
but they wouldn't kill.

36:55.269 --> 36:56.636
After we pulled
your prints off them,

36:56.703 --> 36:57.870
we dumped your whole life.

36:57.938 --> 36:59.205
You know what we found?

36:59.273 --> 37:01.841
$500,000 in
a Cayman Islands account.

Fine. There were two
shooters, all right?
