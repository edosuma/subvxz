00:08.801 --> 00:11.010
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:12.054 --> 00:13.763
You see my wife every day?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.598
What do you want to say?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.518
You gotta know what l'm talking about.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.686
We got a problem.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.021
-There is no "we."
-Kevin knows.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.691
-l'm here to see Jackie Peyton.
-And you are?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.818
-Her husband.
-Jackie's not married.

00:26.902 --> 00:29.070
You pull me in here
and tell me l can't administer meds

00:29.154 --> 00:30.488
and you expect me not to push you?

00:30.572 --> 00:33.324
l don't want HR launching
a full-fledged investigation,

00:33.409 --> 00:35.243
because then l'll have no say in the matter.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.579
lt's been two weeks, Gloria.
l want to get on with my life.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.000
l will prescribe what l think is best

00:43.085 --> 00:45.920
for you in your situation to get you clean.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.005
Are you trying to buy your statues back?

00:48.090 --> 00:50.675
l want them back for the chapel.
Coop wants them back for his wedding.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.759
lt's a win-win.

00:51.844 --> 00:55.430
l took a couple of patches,
might have been four.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.932
l took six.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.102
And l've never been to Haiti.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.096
You shouldn't be talking about this.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.848
Why not? lt's true.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.392
Anyways, if it's sunny out,

02:23.477 --> 02:25.269
all you need is a magnifying glass

02:25.354 --> 02:27.522
and you can make a fire, easy.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.025
l don't need a magnifying glass.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.530
Show me later.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.200
What about tumors?

02:39.785 --> 02:40.785
l get them all the time.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.870
l got tumors like you can't believe.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.664
All over.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.542
Sometimes they hide.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.918
Have a seat, Mr. Digby.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.588
lf you don't let me see a doctor in, like,

02:53.674 --> 02:57.218
five minutes, l'm gonna call an ambulance

02:57.302 --> 02:59.804
and take my business to another hospital.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.973
You wanna use my phone? No?

03:02.057 --> 03:03.724
Okay, have a seat.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.189
-You're not going to like what l have to say.
-Try me.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.359
HR has issued mandatory urine tests

03:13.443 --> 03:15.570
for the nurses in my department.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.614
Failure to comply will be
met with termination.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.867
Today? Tomorrow? When?

03:20.951 --> 03:21.993
Today.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.579
And just so we understand each other,

03:25.247 --> 03:26.664
this is not coming from my office.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.040
lt's straight from HR.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.001
Either way, l don't pee on command.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.502
-Hey.
-Hey, Slater.

03:31.587 --> 03:34.422
-We get to pee in a cup today.
-So l heard.

03:34.673 --> 03:37.800
-Want half a bagel?
-No, thank you. l'm reducing.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.553
Find me when you're ready, both of you.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.723
lf l'm not in my office, l'll be in the chapel.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.892
l'm getting my statues back.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.226
Nothing can stop me now.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.436
Hey!

03:48.520 --> 03:50.897
Are you their boss? You tell her to let me in!

03:50.981 --> 03:52.607
ls it your turn?

03:54.610 --> 03:57.069
You see that? l'm having a seizure.

03:57.613 --> 03:58.988
Where's the camera?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.407
l'm gonna have a seizure and die.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.285
And my lawyer's gonna sue the hospital.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.120
You're gonna get shut down.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.040
And l won't care, because l'm gonna be rich.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.542
You'll be dead.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.878
Urine samples.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.589
Have a nice day.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.653
-What if she wanted half a bagel?
-l'd be fucked.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.238
l thought l'd get a jump on the pee test.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.823
-Wanna see?
-Sure.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.452
All right, vitamin B, zinc, ginger, aspirin.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.330
l load up about eight hours before,

04:49.414 --> 04:50.831
jacks the numbers around.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.917
l like to smoke a little weed.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.126
lt's not worth losing yourjob.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.087
Yeah, no, you're right.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.631
Pound the fluids. Helps increase the output.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.174
A nice watery sample.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.260
-So does that just work for pot or...
-Yeah.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.262
Tox screens are a bitch.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.682
Help yourself.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.266
No, l'm good.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.519
Do l got time for a smoke?

05:15.399 --> 05:17.566
Most blood l ever saw.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.276
He's a Civil War collector.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.404
He was cleaning his Confederate sword.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.905
What is that code for?

05:23.115 --> 05:24.949
We're talking about nerds, not perverts.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.075
A person can be both.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.953
So he was cleaning his sword
with Windex and a rag.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.914
All four fingers... Down to the bone.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.460
l feel bad for the patients who are,
you know, stupid.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.131
lt's a guy l'm dating.

05:40.549 --> 05:43.050
Works in lCU, so...

05:43.510 --> 05:46.095
-Raise the bar, Thor.
-7:00 sharp.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.222
Front row, chapel. Be there.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.890
Got an awesome birthday wedding cake.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.101
Right, Jackie? Jackie's on cake duty.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.770
-Best cake ever.
-Wow, you're in scrubs.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.731
ls it for your birthday?
Happy birthday, by the way.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.066
Thank you, Zoey.
But don't everyone say it all at once.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.484
l want today to be sprinkled with joy.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.861
So if you could spread it out a little,

06:01.945 --> 06:04.363
catch me in the hall, the elevator, wherever.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.074
And since everyone's dying to know
what l'm doing in scrubs,

06:07.159 --> 06:09.243
it's in case a patient pukes on me.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.579
Tuxedo, locked and loaded.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.040
One tux, two ties. Four shoes.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.751
-Where's Slater? l need an opinion.
-He's in admitting.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.502
Yo, Slates!

06:18.587 --> 06:19.754
l need some help with the tie.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.006
Birthday boy's getting hitched.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.591
Did you guys get him anything?

06:23.675 --> 06:26.218
l turned him into Cooper Duper.
That was my gift.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.096
And l apparently bought him a cake,
so he's fine.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.681
Don't tell me
you spent your money on Coop.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.975
What? l believe in birthdays.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.603
You are officially on cake duty.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.397
EMS one minute away. Boiler exploded.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.816
Thirty-year-old male with a foot of pipe
stuck in his stomach.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.485
All right, page O'Hara. Call the OR.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.779
Witnessed explosion.
Thirty-year-old male found down.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.864
Two lines wide open.
He's breathing on his own.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.282
He needs to go straight to the OR.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.785
Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.204
Seriously, straight to surgery.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.371
l need to stabilize him first.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.956
Lenny, let's go. lnside, now.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.875
Look at me. lt's like a candle, okay?

06:57.959 --> 06:59.543
He's gonna go out like that.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.378
You'll be stabilizing him for the morgue.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.130
Come on, let me take him up.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.423
Write in his hand. lt's...

07:04.508 --> 07:06.634
ln his... Write in his hands.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.178
All right, Zoey, take him up now.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.680
There's another one coming.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.226
Thirty-five-year-old male,
crawling around at the scene,

07:15.352 --> 07:17.853
breathing on his own. BP's 1 80 over 1 00.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.522
Valium in the field, five mil.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.774
-l think he might be blind.
-Got it.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.081
Are you gonna chicken out?

07:37.165 --> 07:39.834
-No, are you?
-Nope.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.756
Told you.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.051
lt's okay, l'm Jackie. You're at All Saints.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.178
Sir, sir, can you hear me?

07:51.429 --> 07:52.513
Sir?

07:53.765 --> 07:56.433
"My name is David Bonvino.
l am deaf and blind.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.686
"ln case of emergency, call my brother."

07:58.854 --> 08:01.856
Okay, you handle the meds.
l'll make the call.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.860
-Urine test.
-Leave me alone.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.909
Shit. What if it's a family member?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.704
-l've never done this.
-You got it, boo.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.873
-Hello?
-Zoey?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.916
-Jackie?
-Jackie Jackie?

08:21.209 --> 08:23.127
-We'll take him from here.
-Wait.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.670
Cool yourjets. He's trying to say something.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.547
l got a guy here, deaf and blind,

08:26.631 --> 08:28.757
and a card that says in case of emergency,
call the brother.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.801
-Do you have a brother?
-He can't sign.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.305
Write in his hand. Write in his hand.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.641
He can't sign. Write in his hand.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.437
All right, you're gonna be all right, man.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.025
The guy with the pipe sticking out
of his gut, that's his brother.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.695
Here, l'm gonna write in his hand.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.239
-Gloves?
-No, l'm good.

08:53.408 --> 08:58.370
You are okay.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.206
Okay?

09:04.544 --> 09:08.005
"ls he okay?"

09:12.093 --> 09:13.844
l'm gonna tell him yes.

09:13.929 --> 09:17.264
"Y-E-S." Okay?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.600
What? Do you have a better answer?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.103
Yeah, he's okay.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.735
God, Fi, what did you do?

09:30.153 --> 09:31.695
We made a fire.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.781
l got caught.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.121
Answer your fucking phone.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.457
Nope.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.087
Hey, Jackie. Too much?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.048
lt's either him or me. You gotta pick.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.508
Sorry, Coop.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.885
You may have won the battle,

09:54.970 --> 09:56.637
but l'll win the war. Watch me.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.597
Best man, just saying.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.644
-l know that look.
-Do you?

10:03.728 --> 10:06.480
'Cause if you did, you'd know to
keep that thought to yourself.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.232
Guess l should have picked Coop.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.984
Oh, man, this day...

10:10.318 --> 10:12.444
People gotta leave me alone.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.239
Deaf, blind, tumor, pee test...

10:15.323 --> 10:16.865
Man, l need a fucking break.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.492
Yeah, you do.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.746
lt's Kevin.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.581
-Don't pick that up.
-What?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.459
What are you afraid of? He's in Queens.

10:27.544 --> 10:28.877
You think he's gonna
crawl through the phone

10:28.962 --> 10:31.380
-and be magically standing here?
-Eddie, leave it alone.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.300
No, fuck it. You be afraid if you want.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.176
Me, l'm done running.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.637
Hey, Kev. What can l do for you?

10:39.055 --> 10:40.973
Yeah, do me a favor.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.684
Go find my wife and tell her to pick up
her goddamn phone.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.145
All right, well,
l'll see if anyone knows where she's at.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.397
-ls everything okay?
-Listen to me, Eddie.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.399
Tell her she can blow me off all she wants

10:50.483 --> 10:53.736
after she calls me back,
but she has to call me. Now.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.070
Tell her.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.869
-Everybody okay?
-Call him back.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.872
You were right, you should've picked Coop.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.399
l always knew this day would come.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.902
Yeah, me, too.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.363
lf you're avoiding the urine test,

11:37.447 --> 11:39.156
l want you to tell me now.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.866
No, actually, l'm avoiding my husband,

11:40.950 --> 11:43.160
but thanks for thinking of me.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.954
No running in the halls!

11:46.039 --> 11:47.414
Come on!

11:47.540 --> 11:49.333
Where are your shoes?

11:49.959 --> 11:51.335
Anyone seen my crackhead?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.045
You gotta be more specific.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.505
Vegetarian?

11:54.798 --> 11:56.256
Jackie's got her in 5.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.008
-Quit poking me!
-Stop.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.344
You gotta stay still
or they're gonna restrain you, okay?

12:00.428 --> 12:03.847
Let's get the lV started, we'll get
some fluids in you, a little lV Valium.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.224
You're gonna feel much better, okay?

12:05.308 --> 12:06.850
-You give her Valium yet?
-No.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.852
How about you do the Valium?
l'll do the Zofran.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.272
-Man, l tried for an hour to get a line in.
-So l escaped.

12:12.524 --> 12:16.485
Totally dehydrated.
She was up all night throwing up.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.278
lt was the bacon, not the crack.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.197
-lt was not the crack.
-No?

12:20.281 --> 12:23.200
Monica here ate two pounds of bacon

12:23.284 --> 12:24.910
after not eating meat for six years.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.204
-l see.
-l was tweaking and starving

12:27.288 --> 12:30.290
at the same time,
which is practically impossible.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.501
And then all of a sudden, l smelled bacon.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.671
And l was like, "Bacon! Starving!
Seize the moment!"

12:35.755 --> 12:38.090
l'm Mr. Seize-the-Moment. Just ask Jackie.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.093
Excuse me just a minute.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.011
Hey, what's going on?

12:43.138 --> 12:45.305
Everything checks out,
so l've got a van waiting.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.599
We're gonna take him home.
He'll be more comfortable there.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.601
He looks pretty comfortable where he is.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.104
But there's nothing wrong with him,
and we need the bed.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.314
Just let me do my job, okay?

12:55.817 --> 12:57.401
You need a hand getting him dressed?

12:57.485 --> 12:59.361
-No, l got it.
-Okay.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.075
Bonvino, pipe guy, is he dead or alive?

13:06.202 --> 13:08.078
Alive. lntensive care.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.749
Good. This is O'Hara's patient.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.419
Shit. You gotta keep him in his gown.

13:15.670 --> 13:16.837
But l have a van waiting.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.755
No, l totally fucked up.
You gotta help me out here.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.757
l was supposed to have him up to lCU
an hour ago.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.634
l am gonna get killed.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.262
See, they gotta keep him for serial CTs
and observation.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.264
-Sorry.
-l have to call upstairs.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.433
Okay, you do that. Thor!

13:29.517 --> 13:31.435
-As fast as you can, okay?
-But l'm supposed to meet

13:31.519 --> 13:32.769
Coop's bride by the front entrance

13:32.854 --> 13:33.937
in case she needs help with her hair.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.689
Tell your friend in the lCU to put him
next to his brother.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.650
l want them to be together, okay?
Do whatever you gotta do.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.777
-l will take care of the bride's hair.
-No.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.154
Just go.

13:42.697 --> 13:43.739
-But...
-Go!

13:43.823 --> 13:44.823
But you can't...

13:58.046 --> 13:59.505
l went to, like, 1 0 places.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.964
No one sells wedding cakes.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.716
lt's a world of birthdays out there.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.968
l'm sure it'll be fine. Don't worry about it.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.887
You think that's the bride?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.139
She seems really nervous.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.476
Here, you hold these.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.728
l'm gonna run and get a cart.

14:18.066 --> 14:21.276
Come on. Go inside, go inside.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.363
Come on, honey, go inside.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.241
Go inside.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.408
Yes!

14:29.744 --> 14:31.245
What? Oh, God.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.579
No, no, no.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.208
Oh, God.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.347
T minus one till my Ave Maria.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.724
-Nice cart.
-Urology.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.604
Five more minutes and then back to work.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.607
That's a lot of sugar, people.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.696
-Hurry, hurry, hurry.
-Sorry l'm late.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.488
-l think the bride is a no-show.
-No!

15:51.534 --> 15:53.285
That's really rude.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.855
-l look like an idiot.
-No, no, not at all.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.733
Everybody's together,

16:24.859 --> 16:28.028
the chapel looks like a chapel again,
and it's because of you.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.488
You did it.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.532
Look how happy Akalitus is.
That is not easy.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.042
l feel like an asshole.

16:42.460 --> 16:46.129
-You got me a horse and carriage.
-Not exactly.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.884
No one's ever gonna wanna marry me.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.803
That's not true.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.103
Thank you for my statues, Dr. Cooper.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.327
lt might be kind of dumb, but...

17:20.498 --> 17:22.290
Too soon, Zoey, but thanks.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.418
No, it's for your birthday.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.019
lt's from all of us.

17:43.104 --> 17:52.112
Happy birthday to you

17:52.196 --> 17:57.534
Happy birthday, Dr. Cooper...

17:57.618 --> 17:59.578
-My work here is done.
-Just go.

17:59.662 --> 18:03.206
Happy birthday to you

18:06.127 --> 18:08.044
Happy birthday.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.639
Tough break, Coop.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.101
lt didn't turn out like l thought.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.686
lt never does.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.573
-Just pedal.
-Yeah.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.420
Coop! Wait up.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.801
Slide over.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.835
Somebody get that, please?

19:31.587 --> 19:33.004
Not so fast.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.549
lt's time.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.759
Anything you want to tell me?

19:38.678 --> 19:39.761
Nope.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.934
You saw his face.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.395
You should feel more bad for him.

19:48.479 --> 19:49.563
l do.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.606
l feel horrible for him.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.149
My heart goes out to the guy.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.110
Well, it doesn't look like it.

19:55.236 --> 19:58.363
Zoey, l took a urine test
l know l'm gonna pass.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.699
Let me enjoy it, okay?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.872
Mr. Peyton, welcome.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.208
-And what a pleasure.
-Zoey, right?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.751
Correctamundo.

20:11.836 --> 20:15.839
Sam, l'd like you to meet Jackie's husband,

20:15.923 --> 20:17.966
-Mr. Peyton.
-Nice to meet you.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.929
Welcome to All Saints.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.806
You must be the girls.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.350
We're kind of in a hurry. ls Jackie around?

20:28.269 --> 20:31.229
Yes, l will go find Mrs. Peyton.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.618
-Excuse us.
-Jacks!

20:44.702 --> 20:46.453
Kind of busy.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.497
-Kevin's in admitting.
-God damn it.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.625
With the girls.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.923
-Hope you're happy.
-l'm not.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.933
What do l do? Tell me what to do.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.812
Your daughters are so pretty!

21:16.400 --> 21:17.943
Okay, private moment. l see that,

21:18.027 --> 21:19.444
but l have to pee really bad.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.862
l'm sorry.

21:28.579 --> 21:31.206
Stay calm. Everything will be fine.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.876
The tall one is her daughter.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.419
She's 1 00.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.631
l'm sorry. Granddaughter.
Great-granddaughter.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.467
-Better. Thank you.
-Sorry for your loss.

21:53.354 --> 21:54.354
All right, fine.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.106
l'll take the girls and keep them busy

21:56.190 --> 21:59.150
with x-rays and sugar until l hear from you.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.195
Jackie?

22:04.740 --> 22:07.075
How does a person even get to be that old?

22:07.159 --> 22:10.161
Well, for starters,
a person doesn't fuck the pharmacist.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.455
lt's so much bigger than that.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.126
What the fuck am l doing?
l just peed in a cup.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.961
We all know how that's gonna turn out.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.506
Kev's out there with his head
full of accusations,

22:21.590 --> 22:23.800
most of them true, by the way.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.847
-What?
-She's dead and l'm jealous.

22:30.057 --> 22:34.394
-How fucked up is that?
-Oh, God, please don't get dreary on me.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.021
Come on.

22:37.231 --> 22:39.149
Let's get it over with.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.152
Hello.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.696
l'm looking for a Grace

22:44.780 --> 22:46.823
and Fiona Peyton?

22:46.907 --> 22:48.491
l can't see...

22:48.576 --> 22:51.077
Wow, what a cool surprise, you guys.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.163
So Dr. O'Hara's gonna show you around.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.582
Daddy and l are gonna talk a little bit, okay?

22:55.916 --> 22:57.625
l don't think you'll be so happy

22:57.752 --> 22:59.669
when you find out what l did.

22:59.754 --> 23:02.130
-l bet l will.
-l bet you won't.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.716
Are you guys gonna be long?

23:04.800 --> 23:07.510
You got your books just in case, okay?

23:07.595 --> 23:09.304
-Thank you.
-Fine.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.641
Right, bring your books.
Absolutely no homework allowed.

23:13.934 --> 23:17.062
Follow me.
We shall go and look at broken things.

23:21.609 --> 23:22.942
You brought the girls? Really?

23:23.027 --> 23:24.944
l gotta get this off my chest, Jackie.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.196
And l don't wanna do it at the house

23:26.280 --> 23:27.947
with the girls in the next fucking room.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.158
Okay? Tunie's at work.
What else am l supposed to do?

23:30.242 --> 23:32.577
You're the dad.
You're supposed to hold it in.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.162
Follow me.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.208
-Extra wedding cake.
-We have tons.

23:38.292 --> 23:39.793
No, thank you.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.183
lt's not like l wanna be doing this, okay?

23:56.435 --> 23:59.145
This is the hardest thing l've ever done.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.482
Will you look at me?

24:05.528 --> 24:08.404
One's on meds,
the other one's starting fires.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.657
l have no idea what you're talking about.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.493
Whatever we're doing is messing them up.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.829
Well, l disagree.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.316
We were married in a church.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.277
We had two little girls.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.862
lt's not just a piece of paper.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.531
-Oh, my God, just spit it out.
-l'm trying.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.617
-l've been trying for weeks.
-All right, l'm here. l'm all yours, okay?

24:54.702 --> 24:56.161
Just say what you fucking gotta say.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.204
You can't just step outside a marriage

24:58.289 --> 25:00.748
and fuck someone else,
because things got hard

25:00.833 --> 25:02.500
and expect the marriage to survive.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.836
-Kevin...
-Just let me say it.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.467
l had an affair.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.977
Things got so bad,

25:21.562 --> 25:25.398
so hopeless and lonely,
even in the same room.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.400
And l just...

25:52.176 --> 25:54.802
l don't know what l'm supposed to do.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.472
l fucked up.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.267
lt's over.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.436
lt will never happen again.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.106
You gotta believe me, Jackie.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.276
-Believe me.
-l...

26:13.739 --> 26:15.657
What am l supposed to say?

26:16.158 --> 26:17.617
l don't know.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.328
"l love you"?

26:21.872 --> 26:23.456
"l forgive you"?

26:25.709 --> 26:27.460
Something like that.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.971
Pack your bags.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.650
Fuck 'em.
