Go on, then.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.900
Then do not complain.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.400
That only takes a couple of days.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.200
What if I am not healed by then?

17:06.599 --> 17:09.299

In Edinburgh.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.499
May you remember where
you proposed marriage.

18:34.500 --> 18:37.600
Where was, as I scary shit.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.200
- Stay this weekend.
- Disappointed many people.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.000
Do decepcionarías?

18:44.100 --> 18:45.800
No I said in that tone.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.800
I'm afraid has contracted chlamydia.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.700
I do not have AIDS?

19:12.800 --> 19:15.600
Both HIV tests were negative.

19:15.700 --> 19:21.700
- And hepatitis A, B, and C...?
- No. You have chlamydia.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.199
That thought when I came last week...

19:24.200 --> 19:27.300
I see you've been prescribed
a course of antibiotics.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.999
Means I'm cured, right?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.099
Well, have you followed the instructions?

19:31.100 --> 19:33.299
Two a day, no sex.

19:33.300 --> 19:36.599
Symptoms diminished?

19:36.600 --> 19:40.500
Your penis feels as if cold?

19:40.600 --> 19:43.800
How stuffy nose, sore throat?

19:43.900 --> 19:47.300
No!
My penis feels much better, thanks.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.200
- Although we do not yet speak.
- Have a question?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.300
Why not told me over the phone?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.100
Keep politics.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.799
That frightens patients.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.399
Well, it helps us to put people back and...

20:00.400 --> 20:05.299
can help the other party.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.499
The carrier.

20:07.500 --> 20:11.500
Well, actually it is not...

20:12.200 --> 20:15.699
- Accessible.
- Through a friend, perhaps?

20:15.700 --> 20:18.299
If I could, I would
believe me, Doctor.

20:18.300 --> 20:22.099
See, chlamydia can be difficult to detect
in women.

20:22.100 --> 20:25.799
I know, the silent disease.
I read on the Internet.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.500
- It's good to show interest.
- It's not a hobby.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.499
If he
contact with the carrier, as you call it,

20:32.500 --> 20:36.500
would do us a great service,
her and us.

20:37.300 --> 20:41.300
Hey, I'll be honest with you.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.300
I had sex with a prostitute.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.299
It was my first and only time and...

20:51.300 --> 20:54.500
you know, was totally drunk.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.800
Ie,
I know it's no excuse, but...

20:59.700 --> 21:01.700
I do not know what I do.

21:01.800 --> 21:02.800
Just...

21:02.801 --> 21:05.299
urinating strange things overnight as...

21:05.300 --> 21:09.300
The radiator or closet once.
O on the computer.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.100
When I wake up in the morning,
I remember nothing.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.199
To find a puddle around the house.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.600
Anyway, it was my bachelor party.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.499
Just a brothel and...

21:19.500 --> 21:21.299
You know, just hoping, because Jarvis...

21:21.300 --> 21:23.000
Jarvis is my godfather.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.000
He said there can be smoked.

21:25.100 --> 21:28.499
Just remember.

21:28.500 --> 21:33.200
- I'm surprised that I have stopped.
- In your file says you're single..

21:33.900 --> 21:35.699
Does your girlfriend...?

21:35.700 --> 21:39.700
That is, his fiancee,
you know about all this?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.000
Do you plan to tell?

21:44.100 --> 21:45.299
No.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.700
In his search Internet

21:47.800 --> 21:50.500
did you read about the
different incubation periods?

21:50.900 --> 21:52.800
Periods? What the...?

21:54.800 --> 22:00.700
Incubation periods, the time
hidden disease testing.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.799
Why say that?

22:02.800 --> 22:06.399
You had unprotected sex with a sex worker.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.899
At high risk of new infections are facing,

22:09.900 --> 22:12.999
which
can not be detected immediately.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.600
But I am cured.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.199
For a test to be 100% conclusive

22:19.200 --> 22:22.600
for diseases such

22:22.700 --> 22:25.699
elapse a certain amount of time.

22:25.700 --> 22:26.799
How long?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.300
Some 90 days.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.700
19 days?

22:29.800 --> 22:33.300
90 days! Twelve weeks
if preferred.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.800
I prefer the shorter.

22:34.900 --> 22:40.600
90 days, 12 weeks, 3 months.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.500
Three months.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.200
- We will be married before that.
- I'm a dead man.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.800
Stay positive.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.700
Negative, stay negative.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.999
Look, we will resolve this soon.
You and I...

22:56.000 --> 22:58.300
Taking and thinking.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.500
God!

23:04.500 --> 23:08.500
- Can not have sex with Lydia
for 3 months? - Lower your voice!

23:08.600 --> 23:10.700
- What about oral sex?
- No!

23:11.000 --> 23:13.199
With hand?
Jerk off with her tits?

23:13.200 --> 23:15.400
Just curious, is all.

23:17.900 --> 23:20.000
And condoms are not a solution...

23:20.200 --> 23:22.700
After 6 years,
is like a confession.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.999
So you just have
the "abstinación".

23:25.000 --> 23:27.399
- Abstinence!
- Whatever you call those rare.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.200
We need to find out why they do it.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.100
Or do not?

23:33.700 --> 23:34.900
Is for religion.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.300
By religion, I know.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.699
You ask Lydia,

23:39.700 --> 23:42.199
Do you want to avoid sex
for the wedding night...

23:42.200 --> 23:44.199
something special?

23:44.200 --> 23:46.999
Very deep you,
Jarvis, but forget...

23:47.000 --> 23:48.880
I can not have sex or
my wedding night.

23:48.900 --> 23:52.200
Do not know anyone who
"close the deal" on the wedding night.

23:52.300 --> 23:55.499
I got this. Not in the mood
or pull a smile,

23:55.500 --> 23:56.999
much less...

23:57.000 --> 23:59.800
What about the honeymoon?
Do you also will be there?

24:00.100 --> 24:01.299
I have a room?

24:01.300 --> 24:06.300
I'm screwed!
Tan fucked!

24:06.500 --> 24:08.399
Is stress!

24:08.400 --> 24:10.300
You stressed!

24:10.400 --> 24:11.800
Do not tell me?

24:11.900 --> 24:13.800
Stress what makes you?

24:14.400 --> 24:17.099
- Takes you to suicide?
- Yes, yes, I know.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.299
And before that?

24:18.300 --> 24:21.400
I dunno. Threats, self-injury,
attempted suicide.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.100
- Impotence!
- <i> Christ</i>

24:29.600 --> 24:32.999
Look, Lydia's sex drive
encourage her to try to cure me,

24:33.000 --> 24:34.600
but impotence is a problem...

24:35.200 --> 24:36.800
I do not got.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.200
'd Better cut it.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.600
No.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.900
No, no.
I do not mean cut it, but...

24:48.000 --> 24:50.199
What are you
lock on the fly or something?

24:50.200 --> 24:53.200
I add a few days, but 3 months.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.100
I pour a cup of tea.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.400
I know!

25:03.100 --> 25:07.100
You put a piercing is infected and
all, as Wayne's nose.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.100
Do you remember Wayne's nose?

25:09.500 --> 25:13.900
Toast was put out.
Picture it in your nose.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
"Oh, do not come near me."

25:17.000 --> 25:18.900
I bet it would.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.500
Bet that dirty accept treatment.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.300
It's okay.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.000
Eureka!

25:32.100 --> 25:35.800
- Breaking your frenulum of the glans.
- What?

25:36.400 --> 25:40.200
- Do not. The frenulum of the glans.
- I do not know what it is.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.500
Jarvis, sit!

25:44.600 --> 25:47.100
I will below the table.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.500
Look, look, look.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.700
Ah, that.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.200
I met an old which broke in two.

26:01.400 --> 26:05.000
It was fucking a fat,
leaning against a trash can and fell.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.299
Had dick in a sling for months.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.800
Cock in a sling?

26:11.100 --> 26:13.499
Who is the guy?

26:13.500 --> 26:15.300
How is it called? It's called...

26:16.100 --> 26:18.500
I think it starts with "P" P....

26:18.600 --> 26:19.900
Do you know him?

26:20.600 --> 26:23.499
No, but the story is true.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.199
And even if it were not,
the idea is very good.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.400
We should consider it.

26:29.900 --> 26:32.399
Chlamydia is like chickenpox.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.400
If the fuck is normally
before 10 years.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.999
With other diseases, large,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.099
do not know anyone.

26:43.100 --> 26:45.700
Do not walk around bragging.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.100
Not a ban on transit.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.800
Is AIDS.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.200
What are the odds?

27:02.800 --> 27:05.900
Well, he said Dr.
Cock,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.300
I had unprotected sex with a sex worker.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.500
Yes, but once.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.900
Likely 1,000 to 1, 100 to 1 maybe

27:20.000 --> 27:21.700
People make infidelities.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.600
99% do not what you've done.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.899
I cleaned, researched,
a clean job.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.900
Still, you feel guilty.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.399
That is, it is something terrible.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.200
Something very, very terrible.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.800
What do you think?

27:52.300 --> 27:54.899
Forget it.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.900
Acts as if nothing had happened.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.100
Turn that damn light.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.700
- Are you awake?
- I'm asleep.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.000
I'm sorry.

28:28.200 --> 28:32.000
- What are you doing?
- Hello.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.900
Kiss me.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.800
No, I have to get up early.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.400
I will fast.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.900
Know that rapid scalding me, no.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.599
- Is not it amazing?
- No...

28:48.600 --> 28:51.600
centuries ago.

28:52.100 --> 28:53.700
Go brush your teeth.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.700
Go brush your teeth.

29:07.300 --> 29:10.800
<i>Inside the toilet, Kyle
In the toilet, Kyle</i>

29:31.000 --> 29:32.999
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.899
- You sure.
- I can not!

29:35.900 --> 29:37.200
I'm sorry.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.300
Mommy!

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
I'm sorry. Thank you.

29:43.900 --> 29:46.340
Make Alfie go to the front.
You get dizzy in the back seat.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.800
- Yes - Just like his uncle Kyle..

29:49.800 --> 29:53.199
Come on, Alfie,
a race to the car.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.800
You will be the co-pilot.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
You good with Alfie.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.399
Is a haven for pedophiles.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.499
You always have to think the worst?

30:08.500 --> 30:12.300
Yes, you have to be vigilant.
Look at that man.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.999
Seems to be his father.
And you can not have so many children.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.699
So go play with Alfie.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.500
I do not want them to
think I'm a pedophile.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.299
Are you so paranoid?

30:21.300 --> 30:22.999
That shit happens!

30:23.000 --> 30:24.299
Nothing bad words!

30:24.300 --> 30:25.800
He can not speak.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.600
But when you learn,
I do not want his first word is "shit."

30:30.200 --> 30:32.600
Maybe better than "pedophile".

30:33.200 --> 30:35.500
We shall not be well with our children.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.399
Yeah, you know.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.300
Let's take care of, right?

30:47.100 --> 30:48.100
Honey?

30:48.800 --> 30:49.800
Honey.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.899
Was thinking... Maybe...

30:54.900 --> 30:56.400
stopping the pill?

30:57.700 --> 31:01.400
A pregnancy can take up to 2 years.
Look at Lee and Laura.

31:01.500 --> 31:04.400
If luckily we did immediately,
will not be noticed before the wedding.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.400
're Sweating.

31:09.200 --> 31:13.099
I do not know, is the Jalfrezi.
That got me hot.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.500
Announce it would be amazing wedding.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.800
- Where's the waiter with my beer?
- Kyle?

31:18.500 --> 31:21.699
Yes, it would be amazing, yes.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.000
You're right.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.800
Could take time.

31:25.900 --> 31:27.700
We'll have fun trying.

31:31.300 --> 31:32.500
I go to the bathroom.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.700
Thank you.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.500
I'm dying a cup of tea.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.700
Do you want one?

32:17.800 --> 32:20.300
Come on, shake me, Kyle!

32:41.400 --> 32:43.299
What? What?

32:43.300 --> 32:46.500
Kyle, my pussy is burning me.
I burning pussy!

32:58.000 --> 32:59.100
Are you okay?

32:59.200 --> 33:00.499
What did you do to me?

33:00.500 --> 33:02.099
Not me.

33:02.100 --> 33:05.199
- I think it was the Jalfrezi.
- It was your fucking hand.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.300
I'm sorry.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.600
Feels good.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.200
Feels great.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.400
Better than sex, huh?

33:17.600 --> 33:19.100
I leave you alone.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.300
- You say it was for you.
- Yes, I will admit guilt.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.100
I'm sorry.

33:50.300 --> 33:53.100
Hope you do not get
so late on your big day.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.300
I'm sorry.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.799
I will love you, I comfort you,

34:03.800 --> 34:07.599
honor and protect you and

34:07.600 --> 34:11.399
I'll be true as life has.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.899
- Here comes the part of the vote...
- Now step rings.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.799
- Wait.
- Sorry, do not want to ruin anything, is all.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.000
Sorry to interrupt.

34:20.300 --> 34:23.998
- I assume you are the future
Mr. White.? - That's right.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
I think so.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.799
I understand that there
is a small problem...

34:27.800 --> 34:29.899
With the DJ. Already
was solved?

34:29.900 --> 34:32.100
My future husband will take care of that.

34:32.199 --> 34:33.998
Great, great. And...

34:34.000 --> 34:37.800
- Do you know how come vegans?
- Vegans?

34:43.900 --> 34:45.799
- There will be four.
- Four very well.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.299
Apology...

34:47.300 --> 34:50.099
- Duncan. - Hi.
- Sorry. I'm the godfather.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.900
Can I apply a video projector?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.799
- Clear.
- You can not show that!

34:54.800 --> 34:57.799
- You know how long it took me to edit?
- Jarvis, my grandparents come.

34:57.800 --> 34:58.899
There will be kids there!

34:58.900 --> 35:01.799
Honestly do not see anything.
Only pubis blurred.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.800
- Talk about that later.
- Sorry for the interruption.

35:04.900 --> 35:07.499
No we decided on the flowers.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.999
No problem.
If you are visiting this weekend,

35:10.000 --> 35:13.199
room will be decorated
with lilies, Saturday,

35:13.200 --> 35:15.799
orchids and Sunday.
Beautiful!

35:15.800 --> 35:17.499
Sounds good.
Right, Kyle?

35:17.500 --> 35:20.000
This Weekend?
I can not.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.600
Why?

35:22.000 --> 35:25.700
'll Go fishing and Jarvis.
Sport Fishing.

35:26.400 --> 35:30.299
- Fishing is our hobby.
- It will be only for men.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.299
Work together five days a week.

35:32.300 --> 35:34.600
When you are married,
will be all yours.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.799
- As long as you...
- I'm pressuring,

35:37.800 --> 35:41.600
but I have a husband to look after,
could we?

35:42.600 --> 35:46.200
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Of course.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.600
Thank you.

35:53.200 --> 35:57.200
I appeal to those present,

35:57.600 --> 36:01.100
a witness that I, Lydia...

36:02.000 --> 36:05.300
- Ah, love! Are you okay?
- Lydia.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.600
No, really, I'm fine.

36:12.700 --> 36:14.199
Do you know?

36:14.200 --> 36:16.300
Rather have a hamster...

36:16.400 --> 36:18.399
nipping the frenulum of the glans

36:18.400 --> 36:20.599
to spend the weekend
sitting by a lake...

36:20.600 --> 36:22.600
In a fucking fish!

36:22.700 --> 36:24.299
Better get used to it,

36:24.300 --> 36:27.199
because I will be doing many times.

36:27.200 --> 36:31.500
Lydia already suspected
my new interest in politics late at night.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.499
And I can not keep "helping"
every night with the speech,

36:35.500 --> 36:37.400
even if you're dyslexic.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.000
I guess things are good
contagiándote.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.999
- What?
- Nothing.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.300
What did you say?

36:53.100 --> 36:55.299
- You said I was dyslexic.
- You are!

36:55.300 --> 36:58.099
- And you're good contagiándote
things. - Yeah, well...

36:58.100 --> 36:59.199
It would not have happened...

36:59.200 --> 37:02.000
godfather if my course I
had not been to a brothel.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.600
- And you wanted.
- I was drunk!

37:04.700 --> 37:07.799
- Me too!
- I supposed you'd take care!

37:07.800 --> 37:09.900
You could not do a worse job!

37:11.100 --> 37:13.300
Look, Kyle, sorry.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.900
Kyle, mate, sorry!

37:43.900 --> 37:46.000
Are you at home.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.600
I'm asleep.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.399
Where is Jarvis?

37:50.400 --> 37:53.499
I know you're somewhere, Jarvis!

37:53.500 --> 37:55.699
Out, come out, wherever you are!

37:55.700 --> 37:56.999
What's the matter?

37:57.000 --> 37:58.500
How do I look?

38:01.500 --> 38:02.800
Angry.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.299
- I'm supposed to look sexy.
That told me. - Who?

38:07.300 --> 38:08.900
're Jealous.

38:09.100 --> 38:11.099
Drink some more and come to bed.

38:11.100 --> 38:14.400
Have no right to be jealous
, Kyle White.

38:15.100 --> 38:18.800
I'm yours and I do not even want.

38:26.100 --> 38:27.699
I love you, Lydia.

38:27.700 --> 38:31.000
Do not tell me.
Prove it.

38:31.900 --> 38:35.600
Fuck me or do something, please!

38:36.800 --> 38:37.900
I'm sorry.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.100
You better.

38:42.100 --> 38:45.599
- Why do you make me feel this way?
- Not you.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.000
- I swear.
- So what?

38:51.100 --> 38:53.600
- Preguntas?
- No!

38:53.700 --> 38:56.000
- Because I do.
- What?

38:57.300 --> 39:00.999
I said.
I have doubts.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.500
And you know what?
I'm glad I said.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.699
It's bad enough that I do not touch
. I do not even talk.

39:07.700 --> 39:10.000
Can we talk, baby, still do.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.500
Let's Talk!

39:14.700 --> 39:16.699
Tell me you do not have doubts.

39:16.700 --> 39:21.500
I'm sure!
But you doubt.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.999
I think is normal.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.299
Healthy, maybe.

39:26.300 --> 39:31.100
Is a very serious decision.
Give up everything. And that of...

39:31.200 --> 39:34.500
A cock, a pussy, forever.

39:35.800 --> 39:39.100
Do you think that someday
you might feel tempted?

39:40.400 --> 39:42.199
- Never.
- We are human.

39:42.200 --> 39:46.099
Y makes mistakes.

39:46.100 --> 39:51.300
- Yes, I know, but... - Look how many
divorces and infidelities, anywhere.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.300
I think so, yes.

39:55.500 --> 40:00.000
Do you think you can be unfaithful
still being very much in love?

40:01.100 --> 40:02.600
I do not know.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.100
You've been unfaithful?

40:10.500 --> 40:12.800
I can not lie to that face.

40:12.900 --> 40:16.499
Sure you can.
Just rehearse.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.299
You have been unfaithful?

40:19.300 --> 40:23.099
- I've never cheated.
- You blew it again.

40:23.100 --> 40:25.299
Never repeat the question.

40:25.300 --> 40:28.400
You can tell you're lying because
stuck.

40:29.300 --> 40:30.599
Again,

40:30.600 --> 40:32.800
Have you been unfaithful?

40:35.500 --> 40:36.500
No.

40:39.800 --> 40:45.600
No, I've never cheated.
I would never do. I love you...

40:45.700 --> 40:49.099
It was fatal!

40:49.100 --> 40:53.100
Do not feel compelled to fill the silence.

40:57.600 --> 41:02.100
Envuélvenos Only.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.499
You've been unfaithful?

41:18.500 --> 41:20.199
All right.

41:20.200 --> 41:24.200
Okay,
feel safe returning the question.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.300
Ask me again.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.600
You've been unfaithful?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.500
No.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.799
I swear...

41:42.800 --> 41:45.399
for the health and welfare...

41:45.400 --> 41:48.799
all those who appreciate,

41:48.800 --> 41:52.800
I have never cheated.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.100
- It was OK, right?
- I thought.

41:59.200 --> 42:03.500
You have to be spontaneous,
speak from the heart.

42:03.600 --> 42:07.600
I'll give a little
imagination, be creative.

42:07.700 --> 42:08.700
Do you understand?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
You tricked me?

42:13.400 --> 42:17.400
I swear, for our unborn children
,

42:17.800 --> 42:20.900
I have never cheated.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.300
I'll get a glass of water.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.500
It's okay.

42:43.700 --> 42:46.199
Did you ever consider a gas grill, Kyle?

42:46.200 --> 42:49.000
No,
coal are more efficient. Right, son?

42:49.100 --> 42:53.099
Yes, they are very good.
Calls on your wedding list.

42:53.100 --> 42:56.199
- Are expensive, right?
- I do not know.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.600
Anyone can afford.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.699
Kyle? Would you show your van
Alfie?

43:01.700 --> 43:04.000
Says you killed a rhino with her.

43:04.100 --> 43:06.500
I did not say that.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.700
I said I could do it.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.700
- Are you telling him shit!
- Exactly.

43:12.100 --> 43:15.600
Were in the petting zoo.
He ​​got scared with the large animals.

43:15.700 --> 43:18.000
The van is falling apart.
Do not kill even a cow,

43:18.100 --> 43:20.299
less a fucking rhino.
- What would you have said?

43:20.300 --> 43:23.199
It depends on what you tell him.
The rhino was white or black?

43:23.200 --> 43:24.299
What does that matter?

43:24.300 --> 43:25.600
Can not kill one black.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.600
Right.
If I remember correctly,

43:27.700 --> 43:29.699
are the species most endangered.

43:29.700 --> 43:34.399
No, not that.
Is racist. Racist.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.700
Hey, Alfie!

43:38.000 --> 43:40.499
Already they decided with flowers?

43:40.500 --> 43:42.699
Yes, Mom and I chose lilies.

43:42.700 --> 43:45.199
Good.

43:45.200 --> 43:49.100
- Still the same beautician.
- Yes!

43:50.600 --> 43:54.199
When men go to the last
appointment with the tailor?

43:54.200 --> 43:55.100
Are on the calendar.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.300
My outfit was not me
the day of my wedding.

43:57.500 --> 44:00.799
No, honey, I left much fat
before the wedding.

44:00.800 --> 44:01.999
Stress.
Was that.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.400
Seems that Kyle has lost weight.

44:04.500 --> 44:06.800
Is stress, for sure!
Do not know how it is, folks!

44:07.700 --> 44:09.300
Yes, it's true.

44:09.700 --> 44:11.799
You must stand in front of all those people
,

44:11.800 --> 44:15.199
Say wise things about the
joy of being married,

44:15.200 --> 44:18.699
and then go to the master suite, where
expect the performance of your life.

44:18.700 --> 44:20.700
That does not take away my sleep.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.800
I alone.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.600
'll Go check on the boys.

44:31.100 --> 44:33.699
So a person thinks a verb,

44:33.700 --> 44:37.700
and the others try to guess
asking questions.

44:37.800 --> 44:42.500
But the question must replace
verb for the word "tea".

44:42.600 --> 44:46.600
- Tea? - With that word you
substitute the verb in the sentence.

44:46.900 --> 44:48.400
Better play poker?

44:48.500 --> 44:50.100
God, Michael!
It will be fun!

44:50.200 --> 44:53.199
A small demonstration, right?

44:53.200 --> 44:57.200
'm Thinking of a verb.
Questions should be me.

44:57.500 --> 45:00.400
And if they are wrong,
must have a drink.

45:00.700 --> 45:03.299
We are no longer in school.

45:03.300 --> 45:04.799
I start.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.199
Thou "tetereas" every day?

45:07.200 --> 45:11.000
- Yes, I "tetereo" every day.
- Like "teterear"?

45:11.200 --> 45:12.900
Yes, I love "teterear".

45:13.000 --> 45:15.199
See?
The verb should be conjugated.

45:15.200 --> 45:20.300
- You "tetereas" alone?
- Good question!

45:20.400 --> 45:22.700
Yes, I "tetereo" alone.

45:24.500 --> 45:26.199
Do you have a question, Mic?

45:26.200 --> 45:27.900
Yeah yeah.
I have a.

45:30.100 --> 45:32.099
- Where do you keep the "teapot"?
- Drink!

45:32.100 --> 45:34.499
Maybe I did not explained me well.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.599
The word is a verb.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.699
- Better leave him out.
- Yeah, yeah.

45:38.700 --> 45:42.200
- Forget swallow.
- No, no. Okay, okay.

45:47.500 --> 45:49.800
I have another question.

45:50.900 --> 45:52.899
The "teapot", what color is it?

45:52.900 --> 45:56.399
Is a verb, dad,
as eating or walking.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.299
<i>- Cagada</i>
- That's a noun!

45:58.300 --> 46:01.200
No, okay. "She shits"!
"She shits" is a verb.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.999
He does it every day.
Solito, enjoy it.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.199
I have a question, Roger.
Do you read the newspaper...?

46:07.200 --> 46:09.099
While you have a "teapot"?

46:09.100 --> 46:13.100
Ha! Bravo! Well done, Michael!
I understand, you see? Well done.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.700
Shitting?

46:14.800 --> 46:18.400
Read!
The verb is read.

46:19.300 --> 46:22.500
- I'm good at this. Who's next?
- Yo!

46:23.500 --> 46:25.999
When "teterea" people?

46:26.000 --> 46:28.199
"Tetereas" at any time, night or day.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.899
How long does a "tetereo"?

46:29.900 --> 46:31.100
Depends.

46:31.300 --> 46:34.999
Can last a few hours or more.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.600
What feels "teterear"?

46:37.300 --> 46:41.300
Depends, can be good or
bad, until satisfactory.

46:41.400 --> 46:43.099
But it can be boring.

46:43.100 --> 46:45.399
Almost always, is a natural act.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.400
Do you have to learn to "teterear"?

46:47.500 --> 46:49.899
Yeah yeah.
I'll give you a hint.

46:49.900 --> 46:53.000
You taught me everything I know about
"teterear".

46:54.100 --> 46:57.900
You and Kyle "teterean" together?

46:58.200 --> 47:00.499
Not recently.

47:00.500 --> 47:04.099
In fact, we have no "tetereado"
in a while.

47:04.100 --> 47:06.900
- Like "teterear"?
- I love "teterear".

47:07.000 --> 47:08.600
I love.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.999
Hopefully "tetereáramos"
more often.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.600
Do men think more
"teterear" than women?

47:14.700 --> 47:15.800
Definitely.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.400
Men think it every 3 seconds?

47:20.500 --> 47:22.000
I think some do.

47:22.100 --> 47:23.500
I think I got it!

47:24.900 --> 47:27.200
Fuck!
That's the verb, right?

47:27.300 --> 47:29.400
No, it's not fucking.

47:31.700 --> 47:35.199
Honey, it's getting late.
You should go home.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.800
Me back with you.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.200
What did you say, honey?

47:38.300 --> 47:40.499
I have a meeting in the morning.
I have to get up early.

47:40.500 --> 47:42.900
- 'll Walk from home.
- I thought you said.

47:43.300 --> 47:45.200
No problem, Mom and Dad?

47:45.300 --> 47:48.399
- Both are always welcome!
- Kyle has to work.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.700
Just pick a few things.

48:05.900 --> 48:07.499
What is this meeting?

48:07.500 --> 48:10.199
- You left them alone again.
- Yes, I left.

48:10.200 --> 48:11.499
You leave me alone.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.800
- Voice down.
- Is that what this is about?

48:16.700 --> 48:18.200
Do not make me mourn.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.800
<i>Kyle We're leaving, love</i>

48:22.000 --> 48:25.299
Go and Tend.
Send them away, please!

48:25.300 --> 48:27.400
Go and Tend, seriously!

48:32.900 --> 48:34.200
'll Call you tomorrow.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.500
Lydia.

48:39.600 --> 48:40.800
Lydia!

48:47.100 --> 48:49.900
The word was "fish", right?

48:50.400 --> 48:51.400
Yes.

49:30.400 --> 49:33.499
<i>Hi, this is Lydia. . Thanks for calling
Leave your name and number</i>

49:33.500 --> 49:36.200
<i>I will answer as soon as I can</i>
<i>Thanks, bye </i>..

50:27.600 --> 50:30.400
Where are you, motherfucker?

50:31.100 --> 50:32.900
I'm going to kill myself.

50:33.600 --> 50:36.399
<i>- Kyle</i>
- I hate myself?

50:36.400 --> 50:38.900
I hate you more if you commit suicide.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.199
Lydia sent me a text saying he needs time.

50:42.200 --> 50:43.400
<i>Listen, friend</i>

50:44.300 --> 50:47.699
Sarah, Amy, Leanne.
All said the same shit.

50:47.700 --> 50:49.499
But they all left.

50:49.500 --> 50:51.199
Suicide is not the answer,

50:51.200 --> 50:53.599
Is a permanent solution
to a temporary problem.

50:53.600 --> 50:56.999
- AIDS is a continuing problem.
<i>- You do not have AIDS</i>

50:57.000 --> 51:00.299
I feel as if I did.
Everyone says I've lost weight, and...

51:00.300 --> 51:02.900
I'm cold since went fishing.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.799
Kyle, you can overcome it.

51:04.800 --> 51:07.099
Why? That is,

51:07.100 --> 51:09.699
life ends in total disaster,
forever.

51:09.700 --> 51:13.700
Prison, divorce,
suicide, homelessness...

51:14.000 --> 51:15.700
Look at your family.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.500
Do not do personal friend.

51:18.400 --> 51:22.800
- Seriously, can not stand feeling this way.
- Okay, I'm coming.

51:31.300 --> 51:32.900
Fucking wanker!

51:33.300 --> 51:35.499
- What?
- No, not you, friend.

51:35.500 --> 51:37.099
Are you okay?

51:37.100 --> 51:38.900
'm A wanker.

51:39.700 --> 51:42.500
I pajearé eternally
now I have AIDS.

51:44.300 --> 51:46.400
Marica!

51:46.700 --> 51:48.699
Yes

51:48.700 --> 51:52.100
'm A horrible fag.

51:52.800 --> 51:56.299
Look, I can not talk now,
friend Kyle.

51:56.300 --> 51:58.000
Are you peeing?

51:59.300 --> 52:00.300
<i>Jarvis</i>

52:01.800 --> 52:03.000
<i>Jarvis</i>

52:08.700 --> 52:10.400
Jarvis, are you there?

52:12.800 --> 52:14.800
You tell me why I sent stop.

52:14.900 --> 52:16.499
Belt, mobile phone, return "U".

52:16.500 --> 52:17.899
I see no belt.

52:17.900 --> 52:21.299
No, but I'm very honest.
So you must believe me when I tell you...

52:21.300 --> 52:23.399
I lead an exceptional hurry.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.800
I do not care if it's life or death.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.400
- It is.
- Do not be funny.

52:27.500 --> 52:30.199
No, I'm serious.
My friend is going to commit suicide.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.799
What friend is that?

52:31.800 --> 52:33.199
With the speaker phone.

52:33.200 --> 52:34.700
You can talk to him if you want.

52:35.500 --> 52:38.500
- If me you're kidding...
<i>- Jarvis, are you there</i>

52:38.700 --> 52:41.699
Hello, this is Officer Walker?
Who is this, please?

52:41.700 --> 52:44.100
- What the fuck?
- I think he's taken.

52:44.200 --> 52:46.099
Again, your name, please.

52:46.100 --> 52:47.300
Who fucked you?

52:47.400 --> 52:48.800
Kyle, do not be a moron!

52:48.900 --> 52:51.999
Kyle Walker says the official.
Your friend Mr....

52:52.000 --> 52:52.900
Jarvis.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
Mr. Jarvis argues in its defense
a litany of traffic violations,

52:57.300 --> 53:00.000
you is about to commit suicide..
Is that correct?

53:00.300 --> 53:04.300
- I said I was thinking.
- Fuck me, Kyle!

53:04.600 --> 53:06.399
You just say you're going to kill yourself!

53:06.400 --> 53:09.500
It's okay.
Then I'll kill myself!

53:09.600 --> 53:11.499
Kyle, calm down!

53:11.500 --> 53:14.599
As a police officer, my duty is to take
that threat...

53:14.600 --> 53:15.699
Seriously.

53:15.700 --> 53:18.299
Threat against a person, including yourself
,

53:18.300 --> 53:19.599
is a criminal offense.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.600
Have fun dragging my carcass to court.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.200
Where you are, please?

53:24.300 --> 53:25.900
Do you have a pen, officer?

53:26.000 --> 53:27.200
Yes

53:27.300 --> 53:29.499
I Get that up your ass!

53:29.500 --> 53:31.999
- Your address, please.
- 61 Maple Avenue.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
- Cursed snitch, Jarvis!
- Do not hang up.

53:37.400 --> 53:38.400
Kyle...

53:38.401 --> 53:41.699
Are you satisfied, Jarvis?
It's all your damn fault!

53:41.700 --> 53:42.999
Sorry, Kyle.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.700
<i>Suicide in Progress </i>.

53:50.300 --> 53:52.300
Answer the damn phone!

54:20.700 --> 54:21.700
Kyle!

54:24.000 --> 54:25.900
Fuck!

54:28.900 --> 54:30.800
Where the hell are you?

54:36.800 --> 54:38.100
Damn!

54:56.400 --> 54:59.800
Kyle, no, no!
Fuck no!

55:00.500 --> 55:02.800
Cursed criminal!

55:02.900 --> 55:04.999
You're the criminal.
I almost arrested for you!

55:05.000 --> 55:07.500
I should kill you!

55:10.300 --> 55:13.500
- I love you, man!
- I love you, man.

55:13.600 --> 55:16.700
Do not ever do this again.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.900
Who uses that purple dildo?

55:40.400 --> 55:42.400
Let's finish this...

55:43.300 --> 55:45.600
Now.

56:10.600 --> 56:12.800
Prostitute three months.

56:12.900 --> 56:14.599
What if you postpone the wedding?

56:14.600 --> 56:16.900
Any idea what it costs Wedding?

56:18.400 --> 56:20.099
It's amazing that we did not think before.

56:20.100 --> 56:23.399
Because it is more painful than
break the frenulum of the glans.

56:23.400 --> 56:25.699
Is it more painful to lose
life or a couple of fingers?

56:25.700 --> 56:28.800
- Who said anything about fingers?
- Toast the wedding.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Come to my office.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.299
That will give me tetanus!

56:39.300 --> 56:41.999
Are you worried about tetanus?
Thought you had AIDS.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.599
Total, has no edge.

56:43.600 --> 56:46.000
- I do not mind waiting.
- Do I have to wait?

56:46.100 --> 56:47.800
You can not do it alone.

56:56.700 --> 56:58.199
No good.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.399
Total, you sew
fingers in a heartbeat.

57:00.400 --> 57:03.099
- You will leave in a couple of days.
- I will not cut your hands!

57:03.100 --> 57:04.799
Fagot coward!

57:04.800 --> 57:08.499
Can not be something less
severe, as an overdose?

57:08.500 --> 57:10.799
That looks like a suicide. The only
more fag, suicide

57:10.800 --> 57:12.800
is a suicide attempt.

57:13.700 --> 57:17.400
If you look closely,
is a declaration of love.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.499
What if I make a tattoo?
I do not want to bleed to death.

57:20.500 --> 57:23.500
Do not bleed to death.
Only you are going to faint.

57:24.100 --> 57:26.100
O you will fall into a coma.

57:27.300 --> 57:28.900
A comma sounds good.

57:29.500 --> 57:30.800
A coma.

57:32.900 --> 57:34.700
How do you induce a coma?

57:35.600 --> 57:37.700
Certainly are not alone.

57:38.700 --> 57:41.999
The world is full of desperate wretches.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.099
Dreaming into a coma to
escape the misery...

57:45.100 --> 57:46.500
life.

57:47.100 --> 57:49.299
Yes, but how is it done?

57:49.300 --> 57:56.100
Risky Luce.
A thin line between...

57:56.200 --> 57:59.399
coma death.

57:59.400 --> 58:00.900
Click on this.

58:03.500 --> 58:07.499
Pajéate into a coma.
That I'm not going to help.

58:07.500 --> 58:08.900
Fucking Internet.

58:14.300 --> 58:18.900
I just need something to get
me out of circulation...

58:19.000 --> 58:21.100
for a few weeks.

58:21.900 --> 58:23.500
Something that does not kill you,

58:23.700 --> 58:27.700
Doctors and that fixed easily.

58:27.900 --> 58:29.200
Exactly.

58:32.200 --> 58:33.600
Can burn.

58:34.100 --> 58:35.200
What?

58:35.900 --> 58:38.800
Skin grafts taken forever.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.200
Do you remember Neil?

58:47.300 --> 58:49.800
- In the accident with artificial fires
? - Ah, yes.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.399
Took pieces of ass...

58:53.400 --> 58:55.299
and stuck them in the face.

58:55.300 --> 58:57.299
Neil "ass face".

58:57.300 --> 59:01.799
- That was unfair.
- It was! A face fucking ass!

59:01.800 --> 59:04.200
It became traumatized.

59:06.800 --> 59:08.800
You are sick in the head.

59:09.300 --> 59:12.299
Can burn, it tonight.

59:12.300 --> 59:15.800
We use fire.
A good burned with fire!

59:20.900 --> 59:22.699
Use gas heater.

59:22.700 --> 59:25.299
Does not matter. You burn...

59:25.300 --> 59:27.399
With boiling water.

59:27.400 --> 59:32.300
If we do not fire, boiling water
miss you.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.200
All right.
You're cooking.

59:34.800 --> 59:37.299
- What? - You're cooking.
- Yes, cooking what?

59:37.300 --> 59:39.300
Pasta, potatoes, whatever.

59:49.800 --> 59:53.800
All right.
You took a few shots,

59:53.900 --> 59:57.900
you bend over to pick something up,
bump into the handle of the pan...

59:58.100 --> 59:59.599
and the water is spilled
you in the head.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.800
No, anywhere but the head.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.700
- Then on your back.
- Yes

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.400
Kyle "Back of ass"..

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.300
Listen, I'll wait in the other room.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.200
And when you hear...

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.700
I'll call...

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.500
Do you really want to?

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.200
Have to.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.900
Must be another way.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.700
There is not.

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.100
Lydia only knew how much you loved her.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.500
Better not put this in your speech.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.800
I do not wear it.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.700
I do not wear it.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.399
Kyle! Wait, wait!
It occurred to me something good!

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.099
Check this out! We can not make
exams before the wedding,

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.800
because 10 weeks is not enough.
What if we look at it?

01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.700
To whom?

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.399
A sex worker with whom you
had unprotected intercourse.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.299
Stop describe it well.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.299
No, if examined and cleaned out,

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.199
means that you are clean.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.100
Do not be a contamination
AIDS from someone who does not.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.199
Look at me.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.299
Look

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.999
back to the brothel,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.699
find the carrier,

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.300
and we do an AIDS test.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.699
How do we find the place?

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.800
Asking.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.400
To whom?

01:02:42.401 --> 01:02:46.400
Tourist Information
do not guide to brothels.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.599
We cross our path.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.200
Easier said than I do.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.800
We had a few drinks in the hotel bar.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Aha.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.700
Then we went to a pub.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.900
A cheap place.
A few more drinks.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.700
I know.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.300
We went to the Internet and look
massage parlors in Newcastle.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.200
We search Google.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.800
That will be a big hassle.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.700
"Newcastle brothel".

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.199
No!

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.800
I did wrong.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.100
Massage.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.100
That's it.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.799
El Santuario... Bubbles...

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.699
"Foxy Break Knights".
I like it as it sounds.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.099
- It will take an eternity.
- We can not, take a virtual tour...

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.100
from brothels.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.099
Watch"
Visit our oasis of mad passion."

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.500
Lower your voice!

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.000
Experienced ladies that will
fulfill all your cravings.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.400
Shut up!
Look at the photos.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.400
Was she blonde or brunette?

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.800
It was not blonde.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.800
What do you remember accurately?

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.099
Was pretty... Robusta.

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:26.799
- Gorda.
- No, like... voluptuous.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.100
Gorda.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.899
- I think he had a tattoo.
- A big tattoo.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.899
Here.
We have two blondes, too skinny.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.499
We write down the address and explored.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.500
Do you have a pen?

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.100
Not Here in the van.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.800
It's okay.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.600
Where is the printer?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.800
You can not print that!

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.500
Someone is printing?

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.000
You a complete idiot!

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.700
Someone is printing?

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.600
Then say something.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.500
- I have someone document.
- Say something, damn it!

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.600
Is printing a document.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.300
- Is someone?
- Yes!

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.100
Pajero.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.899

pounds and 25 ¢ per page.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.700
Are one, two...

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.300
£ 2.50, here. My change...

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.700
They closed at Foxy's about 3 months ago.

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.900
- All right.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.000
Thanks..

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.300

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.200
- This is The Sanctuary.
- Maybe it's cute inside.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.199
- Then I'll tell you.
- What do you mean?

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.300
- I'm not going with you?
- Not required.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.200
No... It's for your safety.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.500
You will not go alone.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.100
No. 5 for Sanctuary.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.400
Do you have a reservation?

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.600
No, no reserve.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.600
- Sue?
<i>- Yes</i>

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.000
Not have reservation.

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.400
<i>Does not matter, let them in</i>

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.600
Thanks.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.500
All right, guys?
Had they come earlier?

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.100
Perhaps yes.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.400
Sit.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.600
Do you want a drink while you wait?

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.100
- No thanks.
- I'd kill for a cup of tea.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.199
Somebody turn on the kettle!

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.400
Girls come soon.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.700
- Are you sure it was not her?
- No.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.900
- Hi, my name is Magali.
- Hello, Magali.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.600
- My name is Victoria.
- Victoria.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.200
Hi, my name is Aura.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.500
Aura.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.000
Do you see something you like?

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.299
Put ​​out that cigarette!

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:57.000
We operate in a smoke free environment.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.500
I see.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.900
For which decided?

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.100
Gives us a minute?
To confer.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.499
Private.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.000
Come on, girls.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.299
- This is not the place.
- What are you talking about?

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.200
You could smoke.
I remember.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.399
Well, elimination.
We progressed a little.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.299
We progressed,
but what the hell do we do now?

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.698
- What are you talking about?
- How do we get out?

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.000
Not believe that suddenly
do not want sex.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:34.599
Say that the van is parked wrong.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.800
No
They let you out at the same time.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.399
I will say that I forgot my wallet.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:42.700
What about me?

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.899
- I see.
- What?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.700
I get it.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.999
- I get it.
- What are you complaining about?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.300
No, okay.
Do not worry.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:09:00.200
No, if necessary,
I sacrifice for both.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.800
Okay, guys.
Have you already decided?

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.599
All are beautiful and...

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.399
I'm going with the No. 1

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.399
Magali, Magalin,
Mogli, Magli, how is it?

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:14.698
And for your friend?

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.700
No, no.
He ​​is only going to pay.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.299
You can take my tea.

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.500
Magali!

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.300
Hello, Magali.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.100
Where
bought the painting of cats?

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.200
Thank you very much.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.200
A mint?

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.700
The things I do for you.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.200
- No need to thank me.
- It cost me 80 pounds.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.600
If not for me, both be there.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.099
Ah!
How noble of you.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.800
You sacrificed, right?

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.699
- Only talk.
- Yes? Lie!

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:24.799
Speak.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.499
No payment for the passes you talking...

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.399
each establishment we visit.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.200
Are not you glad that only one visit is?

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.300
What?

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.899
Magali told me...

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.199
there is only one open late brothel...

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.100
- Hungry boyfriends for sex.
- What?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.500
Want to know?

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.500
Do not be silly.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.400
Apologize.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.500
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.000
- I dunno.
- Why use me?

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.900
Do you have any idea how dirty I feel?

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.100
You said you just spoke.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.800
And it was.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.800
- Turn off the light.
- Okay.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.500
This way, gentlemen.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.899
You!
Make sure your friend does not vomit.

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.000
Do not worry.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.400
- Anything to drink?
- Beer, please.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.600
Do you mind if I smoke?

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.600
As long as it's not crack.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.200
Is here.
This is the place!

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.900
Are you sure it was not her?

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.000
Fantastic.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.800
Hi. I'm Miranda.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.800
Miranda.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.800
Hi. My name is Roxy.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.600
Roxy.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.800
Hello dolls.
I'm Crystal.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:25.600
Yes sure.

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.900
Good night.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.600
My name is Monica.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.600
Can not be.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.200
Not any of them.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.400
Would you sacrifice me again?

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.499
- Want to take another look?
- No, not any of them.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.200
Has to be more.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.200
Maybe he's on vacation.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.900
O is sick.
In particular, if you have...

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:06.200
Sorry, pal.
You walk alone?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.299
My partner is up losing virginity.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.400
Great.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.100
Hello dolls.
Have you already decided?

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.700
Can we wait for
the one with your friend?

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.800
Fairness.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.000
It's okay.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.499
Melanie, honey!

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.200
Hasten the ass, will you?

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:45.400
- Well, gentlemen, I'm Melanie.
- Melanie.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.100
A second.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.800
Can I see you back, please?

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:55.399
I think I've seen.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.600
Really?

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.400
Been here a few weeks ago.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.499
- Do you remember me?
- I do not remember them all, but...

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.900
You're hard to forget.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:11.499
Can we...

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.399
go upstairs?

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.400
If necessary.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.600
60 per half hour, 100 for one. Use
uniforms, make characters,

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.100
is extra.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.100
I think it will only take me half an hour.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.900
I will below. When I return, I love you
naked and in bed.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.800
The bathrooms are down the hall.

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.199
- I satisfy the desire of patience.
- Yes, I know...

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.399
Maybe we can just...
Talk?

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.000
You look nervous.
Let me give you a massage.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.399
Can I put me jeans?

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.899
Why?

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.500
If the pants are dirty...

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.600
No, of course not!

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.499
Believe me, I've seen around here.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:30.100
- No, they are clean, I swear.
- Let me see. Let me see!

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.400
Well, now lie.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.200
Try to relax.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.200
- Not here to give me a massage.
- It is to get fit.

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.600
- I did not mean that.
- Try to relax!

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.600
The number of knots is not normal.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:20.500
I'm a little stressed.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.200
Back?
For a final display?

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.200
I'm getting married.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.800
Congratulations.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.599
Well,

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.900
want to marry,

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.499
I can not.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.700
Why not?

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.700
Because I'm sick.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.800
You're not sick.
Just male needs.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:53.100
I am sick.
I'm dying.

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.399
Well,

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.100
maybe I'm dying.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.600
Can you do a review of AIDS
please?

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.199
When I was here I was
infected with chlamydia.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.099
I thought if you were taking and returning
examination,

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.699
could have sex again with my fiancee
,

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.299
And save my wedding!

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.600
Breathe.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.600
I retract,
I have not seen everything.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:36.900
For starters, I do not have chlamydia.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.500
They call
silent disease and symptoms can be latent.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.200
Thank you, doctor.
I already know.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.600
I check regularly, because
I act in films.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.599
Sales in all these!

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.700
Do not remember anything, right?

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.600
Honey... We had sex.

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.200
- What?
- You could not.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:09.600
Mean... What I did not want?

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.599
No, yes you wanted.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.599
But you could not, even if I tried.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.500
It was like trying to get jelly.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:26.700
I left only with DVDs and
penis ring. When I returned, you were...

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.699
Say,

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:32.000
making improper use of the site.

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:40.000
Remember I peed in the shower?

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.400
Then we had sex?

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.899
That's good, right?

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:56.500
Is clear. If I was not
cheating, I can not have...

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.800
But if...

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.099
What the...

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.100
Who else you slept?

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.200
No.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.499
<i>I add some balls huge as mine</i>

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.400
- Come, let us go.
- Wait, friend.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:16.500
- We're going. Now!
- Is everything okay?

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.800
No, nothing is right!

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.500
Does not she...?

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.199
Do not the test be done?

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.200
Worst.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.900
- Do not tell me you have HIV.
- Worst.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.199
- Already developed the disease?
- Worst!

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.699
What is worse than the fucking
have developed AIDS?

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:35.400
Lydia was unfaithful.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.900
I do not understand.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:41.500
I did not have sex. I'm not unfaithful.
Will not stop me.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.699
- I thought you said...
- No, it does not matter.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:45.700
What matters...

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.200
I do not got it from chlamydia here.
It was at home.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.500
At least, I understand how you feel.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.199
And you're right to feel
hurt, angry,

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.599
- betrayed...
- Quiet.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.299
're In a massage parlor.

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.700
- I did nothing.
- But you tried.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.200
But I did not.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.299
If it makes you feel better,
go up and we get hand.

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.199
Is a great idea.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.999
No thanks. Step.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.299
No, take them with both.
A real revenge.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.499
If I'm up to the circumstances...

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.499
Prefer to remain innocent in all this.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:23.300
This is unbelievable.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.000
Moreover,

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.300
I'll get even.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.900
Do not know yet, but I will.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.400
And if you try to forgive?

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:44.200
I can not.
I have this image in my mind,

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.900
returning and returns.

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.400
A picture of what?

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:55.200
Maybe
his girlfriend having sex with another?

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.100
- Yes, of course.
- Who do you think is?

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.300
May be several people.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.599
- Anda from bed to bed?
- No!

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.099
Mean, someone
among several people.

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:10.399
- Maybe they gang raped.
- Many girls decide to have fun...

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.900
before the big day.
- Maybe having an affair.

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:17.100
- Then do not love me, right?
- Do not be stupid.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.699
Are you saying that men
can trick the woman they love,

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.500
but not women?

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.500
So maybe not the master.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.900
Of course you love her.

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.400
Would you have gone through all this
if not loved?

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.499
Seriously, girls,
the things that happened...

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.140
to not give you an STD.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.600
All Prince Charming.

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.500
And Lydia?

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:44.900
She infected me, is not it?

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.799
May not know they have it.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.799
The Silent Disease.
Remember, doctor?

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.000
You'll have to tell him.

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.800
I'd pay to speak.

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.000
I'll tell you.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.800
Do not worry.

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.300
I do not think it's a good idea.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:02.400
If the test is not done,
can ruin your fertility.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:06.900
I know Lydia. Want to have children
with whom you are sleeping.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.299
- Can you send a text or something?
- What?

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:14.100
And give you the opportunity
to make up an excuse?

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:19.799
Your Parents need to know why
the wedding is canceled.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.099
Do your parents?

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:25.100
No, they do not.
Kyle, man!

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.099
Think about it.

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.500
- Want to marry her.
- Wanted.

01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.900
Until I knew someone
his cock buried him sick.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
That spoiled my plans a little.

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.300
- Not the car of your parents?
- Yes

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.400
I want to do this once.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.400
Hey, wait!
I will not let you do this!

01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:00.200
- Listen to...
- Yes, but this time I have reason!

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.900
Hey, do not.

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.200
For Me!

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:09.700
Hey, did I,
a certified dyslexic,

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.800
write my best man speech at all.

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.500
Save it for my upcoming wedding.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.800
Yes, but listen!
What paintball video?

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.700
I took forever editing.

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.000
- Put it on the fucking Internet.
- Kyle, no!

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:41.500
What is this about?
We were not expecting.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.799
Do not just stand there, Kyle.
Come inside.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.500
Hello, love.
How are you?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.799
Waited in the door as Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.699
- How you make us go through this?
- No problem.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.699
It is, if you already were going to dinner.

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.699
Anne made a casserole and there are
more than enough, is not it, honey?

01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.899
Freeze planned for Mom.

01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.999
Did not get to eat in the geriatric?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Seriously,
do not want to cause problems.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:09.099
It's no problem.
In addition, we are already family, right?

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.500
Drink to that!

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.800
And what do we owe the honor?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
There is something
important I want to tell.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.500
- Come in.
- Lydia must be present.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.100
- Is she here?
- Go there. Lydia!

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:32.600
<i>I'm on the phone</i>

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.500
I will not say anything until she drops.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.000
Ah, I see.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.500
No, dad, you do not.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:48.300
- Yes, son, of course.
- No, Dad. I tell you no.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.300
Security fetched
champagne to make the announcement.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.400
Lydia!
It Cool!

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.600
- Let's start.
- This looks delicious.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.099
- Kyle.
- I feel nauseous.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.700
- Kyle!
- You had a bad night?

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.800
Do not look good at all.

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.600
Is women who
ill with this, are you, Roger?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.700
- Sorry to take me much.
- Here she is.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.499
Do not kiss me.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.499
Not feeling well, poor thing.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.800
- It's OK.
- Hi, honey.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.400
Could you pass wine please Mic?

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.000
Are you sure?

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:37.300
Yes

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.100
So health!

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.200
So you feel good, Lydia?

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:54.300
- Yes, I'm fine.
- No complaint?

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.200
Not at all.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:00.800
- No symptoms?
- Symptoms?

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:05.600
Yes, like a rash or swelling.

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.100
Painful urination stuff.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.000
That's news to me.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.600
No, I'm fine.

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.800
- It's delicious, Anne.
- I'll pass the recipe.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.500
Anne is a very good cook.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.899
I'm glad you feel good.

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:27.200
I would not wish my illness
contagiarte.

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:30.700
You know what, Kyle? If you do not
feel well, you should go to bed,

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.499
Have you seen a doctor?

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.499
In fact, I did.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.199
You were with who have acne.
Dr. Clifford.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.600
No, I saw a specialist.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.200
A specialist?
In what area?

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.499
- Genitourinary Medical...
- is not a topic for dinner.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.500
Genito...

01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:48.399
Genitourinary, Dad.
A doctor cock.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.200
Kyle!
We're eating.

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.900
Yes! And I'm telling you about my visit...

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
the doctor cocks.
- Kyle.

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:59.200
I went to the clinic and
had to show my cock.

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.200
Kyle!

01:28:00.201 --> 01:28:06.800
The nurse examined me
looking warts, lesions, fluids.

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.199
Kyle, please!

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.499
Then used a giant pipe cleaners,

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.100
stuffed it in my cock,

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.600
dirty and sent for analysis swab.

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:18.499
- What's wrong?
- And guess what.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.700
Turned...

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:23.600
I have a sexually transmitted disease.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.900
And I thought I was pregnant.

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.399
I do not talk about that
in front of my parents.

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.799
They have every right to know...

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:35.599
Why wedding is canceled.
- What?

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.399
Can not cancel the wedding!

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.899
I can and I will.

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:42.099
Y on very solid foundations.

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.099
But paid deposits!

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:46.899
Not fair to lose money.
Kyle did nothing wrong.

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.199
- I did not do anything wrong.
- Hit me chlamydia!

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.999
- That's impossible!
- The proof exams!

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.899
There must be a mistake.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:56.399
My tearful cock
thinks otherwise!

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.499
Must sorry infected someone else.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.399
Yes, of course, how easy.
Blame me, attack me.

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.400
There must be an explanation
logic. I mean...

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.900
Do not know if you know, Kyle, but...

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.099
infections can remain like this...

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:13.099
dormant in the body.

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.699
Very good point, Roger, and...

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.699
a couple of months ago, no,

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.100
did not know.

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.700
But it can not be
dormant for 6 years.

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.199
Is the time I've been in a...

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.299
monogamous relationship.

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:30.099
Do these things do not normally
get to sit on dirty toilets?

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:34.800
Only if you use it as a big hole
pleasure, Anne.

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.800
- Then I'll explain.
- Wait a minute.

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.100
Dress Dr.
Cock a couple of months ago.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.899
Two months.

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.800
Not what you had not said anything?

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.700
Well I do not...

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.399
Two months is enough time to...

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.400
keep quiet and I believe
VD, Kyle.

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.800
- I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.799
That you were the...

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.699
carrier.

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:12.999
Carrier. Wait a minute,
if you knew you had it,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.200
must have been sure that I too.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.200
Unless someone has caught you.

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:20.900
No.

01:30:20.901 --> 01:30:22.199
Is that, right?

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:24.700
You were not sure it was me, right?

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.800
Not 100%.

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.100
The deposit went to shit.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.399
See. Can you ask him who will
infected?

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.100
Who?

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:36.200
- Stop repeating each question!
- Whose side are you, Mom?

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:39.999
That depends on how you respond.
Answer the jod...!

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.299
Doomed question.

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:44.299
Okay, I'll answer.

01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.999
We celebrated my bachelor party.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.999
We went to a massage parlor,
but I did nothing!

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.499
You expect me to believe that?

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.500
It's true.

01:30:53.501 --> 01:30:55.599
- Not true, son.
- It's the damn truth, Dad!

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.800
Control your language.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.300
Just want to say,

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:05.400
for me, paying for sex with prostitutes is
rape.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.900
Leave the damn drama, woman!

01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.199
'm Just saying...

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.299
not rape if...

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.999
Well, if it is consensual
sex between two adults,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.700
You know.
It's what I'm saying.

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:26.199
I'm not a rapist, Anne.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.099
Because I could not.

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:32.800
Should know that
was so drunk, I could not even...

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:36.000
- Satisfied?
- Overwhelmed, love.

01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:37.500
<i>I mean, believe me</i>

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.499
I believe you, son.
Is,

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.099
Stephen Hawkings has more
activity down there,

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.900
when I'm drunk.
Right, Roger?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.799
I usually do not get to be so drunk.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.600
I would not say that, honey.

01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:53.599
Not much to
round you fall in bed.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.699
Easier vomit on the bed, making love.

01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.100
I think you understand, darling.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.099
However,

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.800
not understand that no matter what you are
stop with a prostitute.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:08.399
No, I think it does not matter.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:12.400
But at least test
that contagiaste me.

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.099
Will you tell us how?

01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:18.500
O
This is the case of immaculate infection?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.699
Well, there may be something.

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:25.900
- Really? Adelante!
- Not in front of my parents.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.800
Our parents think I'm impotent rapist.

01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:31.799
Is fair to listen your version.

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:35.000
- I've heard enough.
- I.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.700
- I have not finished eating.
- I'm staying. - Yes.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.200
Judge for yourself, Dad.

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.299
A while back,

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:51.500
a girl from work
gave a party at his house.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.899
A lingerie party.
I remember...

01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:58.500
I bought...

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.600
bodice... - Yes, yes, I remember.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:07.500
Not only sell lingerie.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.999
Also accessories for the bedroom.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.699
- Electric blankets and stuff.
- No, dildos, anal beads.

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:19.300
Well, I've heard enough.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.999
Michael, would you accompany
me to study for a whiskey?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.800
Finish this and I'll be there.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Dad!

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.500
It's okay.

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.799
The girls had drunk a little,

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.800
including me and...

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.400
started... You know,

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.499
to prove things.

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:47.500
Really?

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.200
Yes, things
passed from hand to hand, the exchanged.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.100
It seems that one of the
girls had something.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.900
The big purple dildo?

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.700
Yes, there wine.

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.499
You're telling me...

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:08.500
tricked me with a dildo?

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:12.500
If you call that cheating, yes.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.500
God!

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.500
Do you swear it's true?

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:34.000
Swear by the health and welfare of all
those who appreciate...

01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.600
that's the truth.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:38.800
What did you say?

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.000
I said I swear by the health and
welfare of all those to appreciation,

01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:46.500
That's the truth.

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.100
What?

01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.000
Kyle?

01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.600
Kyle, where are you going?
Kyle!
