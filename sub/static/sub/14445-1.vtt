02:21.308 --> 02:23.743
Hey, I'll bet you
10 bucks

02:23.810 --> 02:26.974
the steps of that train
don't stop no more than...

02:27.047 --> 02:28.982
1 foot from that line.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.143
Would you try to show
a little respect?

02:31.218 --> 02:32.218
5 bucks!

02:32.219 --> 02:33.551
Cut it out, Tom.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.054
We're here
for a funeral.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.616
Which way is town?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.120
Just follow
the road.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.622
You can't
miss it.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.461
You, uh,
you know him?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.790
No...

03:18.865 --> 03:20.458
but I know
that type.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.967
I don't like it.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.631
What do you suppose
he's doing here?

03:25.705 --> 03:28.368
We'll probably find out
soon enough.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.640
Excuse me.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.646
Isn't anybody else
getting off here?

03:33.713 --> 03:34.713
No, sir.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.858
Well, I guess
he ain't coming.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.860
Might as well go on
with the funeral

03:46.927 --> 03:48.361
and get it
over with.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.988
Oh, that's a good way
of putting it.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.501
You two guys could have won
yourselves 5 bucks apiece.

04:58.030 --> 05:01.262
Did, uh, anybody else
get off that train...

05:01.333 --> 05:03.598
uh, besides
yourself?

05:03.669 --> 05:05.262
No.

05:05.337 --> 05:08.637
You know a man
name of John Elder?

05:08.707 --> 05:11.142
I know.
I know of him.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.770
Would you be
afraid of him?

05:13.846 --> 05:14.939
No.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.848
But you must be.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.512
That's usually why
people hire me...

05:20.586 --> 05:22.452
because they're
worried about somebody

05:22.521 --> 05:23.784
or scared.

05:23.856 --> 05:27.315
Don't go jumping
to any conclusions.

05:28.594 --> 05:32.292
I didn't know John Elder
was even in these parts.

05:32.364 --> 05:34.458
Well,
he probably isn't,

05:34.533 --> 05:37.469
so maybe all you'll have to do
to earn your money

05:37.536 --> 05:39.471
is just hang around
for a while

05:39.538 --> 05:41.530
and then go back
on another train.

05:41.607 --> 05:42.973
Look...

05:43.042 --> 05:45.978
I don't care
what I have to do

05:46.045 --> 05:47.980
as long as I get paid.

05:48.047 --> 05:50.016
You'll get paid.

05:50.082 --> 05:51.209
Go ahead.

05:51.283 --> 05:53.218
Stow your gear
in the house.

06:06.665 --> 06:09.601
What are you hiring
a gunman for, Pa?

06:09.668 --> 06:12.433
You're too young to remember
John Elder, aren't you, David?

06:12.504 --> 06:14.939
What do the Elders
have to do with us?

06:15.007 --> 06:16.007
Not the Elders.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.099
Just John.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.112
Well, what does he
have to do with us?

06:20.179 --> 06:22.114
When he left here,
you see,

06:22.181 --> 06:24.616
this ranch belonged
to his family.

06:24.683 --> 06:26.117
But this is our land.

06:26.185 --> 06:27.619
I mean, we own this.

06:27.686 --> 06:29.120
Of course it is,
son.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.188
Sure, it is.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.124
It's just that
he might want

06:32.191 --> 06:33.955
to figure it
differently.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.997
We need this land.

06:38.063 --> 06:40.123
We're going
to keep it.

07:36.822 --> 07:38.757
That's a... a
peculiar way

07:38.824 --> 07:41.259
to dress for
a funeral, isn't it?

07:41.327 --> 07:44.764
Could turn out to be
a lot more than a funeral.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.664
Why, considering John Elder
didn't get off the train?

07:47.733 --> 07:50.293
That still doesn't mean
he won't show up.

07:50.369 --> 07:51.962
No, no,
but even so,

07:52.037 --> 07:55.474
the man isn't likely to shoot up
his own mother's funeral,

07:55.541 --> 07:57.806
at least, not without
a pretty good reason.

07:57.876 --> 07:59.902
He might think he's
got a good reason.

07:59.978 --> 08:02.641
Besides, there's that one
that got off the train.

08:03.982 --> 08:05.917
Whoa.

08:15.227 --> 08:19.927
Ben, John Elder isn't wanted
for anything around here.

08:19.998 --> 08:21.261
Remember that.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.767
He's a gunfighter.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.930
That puts him on one side
and me on the other.

08:26.004 --> 08:28.940
You taught me that
in the first place.

08:37.015 --> 08:41.282
Almighty God,
we commend the soul

08:41.352 --> 08:43.288
of our dear
and pretty sister

08:43.355 --> 08:46.814
departed Katie Elder
to your care

08:46.892 --> 08:49.327
as we commit her body
to the ground

08:49.395 --> 08:50.829
beside her loved husband.

08:50.896 --> 08:53.627
Katie Elder...

08:53.699 --> 08:57.067
a woman beloved of all,

08:57.136 --> 08:58.570
a hard-working,

08:58.637 --> 09:00.230
honest woman.

09:00.305 --> 09:02.240
She helped in your work,
O Lord,

09:02.307 --> 09:04.572
in a thousand ways.

09:04.643 --> 09:07.078
She was a friend to all,

09:07.146 --> 09:09.411
a comfort to the sick.

09:09.481 --> 09:11.746
She has left this world
a little better

09:11.817 --> 09:13.547
for having lived in it,

09:13.619 --> 09:16.418
and those who knew her
and loved her

09:16.488 --> 09:19.253
are better
for having lived

09:19.324 --> 09:21.555
in the warmth
of her understanding.

09:21.627 --> 09:25.428
Katie Elder lived here in
Clearwater for many years.

09:25.497 --> 09:28.661
All of us gathered here
today knew her well.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.430
She raised four sons...

09:30.502 --> 09:35.566
John, Tom, Matt,
and Bud, the youngest.

09:35.641 --> 09:38.770
She was a woman who wanted
nothing for herself,

09:38.844 --> 09:42.645
wanted only to give
rather than to receive.

09:42.714 --> 09:45.445
She devoted her life
to helping her family,

09:45.517 --> 09:46.951
her friends.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.620
Earth to earth,

09:50.689 --> 09:52.453
ashes to ashes,

09:52.524 --> 09:54.288
and dust to dust,

09:54.359 --> 09:56.794
in the sure
and certain belief

09:56.862 --> 10:00.128
in the resurrection
unto the eternal life.

10:00.199 --> 10:04.295
O God, whose mercies
cannot be numbered,

10:04.369 --> 10:08.500
answer our prayers on behalf
of Thy servant's soul

10:08.574 --> 10:10.975
and grant her an entrance

10:11.043 --> 10:13.740
into the land
of light and joy

10:13.812 --> 10:18.307
and the fellowship
of Thy saints.

10:18.383 --> 10:19.646
Amen.

10:19.718 --> 10:20.981
Amen.

10:40.572 --> 10:44.509
You know, she sold me
a blind horse once...

10:44.576 --> 10:48.172
a woman,
doing that to me.

10:48.247 --> 10:50.682
She really
suckered me good.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.022
This is Katie.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.183
She was named after your mother.

11:00.692 --> 11:03.127
She's a handsome baby.

11:03.195 --> 11:06.131
I just thought
you would like to know it.

11:13.372 --> 11:15.307
There's one of you missing,
ain't there?

11:15.374 --> 11:17.809
Yes, sir.
John, the oldest.

11:17.876 --> 11:20.471
He moves around
a lot.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.481
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

11:22.548 --> 11:25.143
Thank you, Parson,
you've done plenty.

11:25.217 --> 11:26.810
Done what?

11:26.885 --> 11:28.319
Wrote a few
letters?

11:28.387 --> 11:29.446
No... No, sir.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.922
That was a real nice sermon
you gave, sir.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.424
It wasn't enough.

11:33.492 --> 11:36.428
She belonged to have
pretty words spoke over her,

11:36.495 --> 11:37.929
and I didn't do it.

11:37.996 --> 11:40.932
I thought you spoke
good, Parson, real good.

11:40.999 --> 11:42.661
Not good enough.

11:42.734 --> 11:44.999
Not for her.

11:45.070 --> 11:48.006
But I don't suppose
you'd know that.

12:56.575 --> 12:57.702
Billy.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.438
Hello, John.

12:59.511 --> 13:03.278
You ought to have
better sense than that...

13:03.348 --> 13:05.316
coming up behind a man.

13:05.449 --> 13:07.611
You're as fast
as you used to be,

13:07.685 --> 13:10.280
maybe faster.

13:10.354 --> 13:13.051
Been, uh, getting
lots of practice?

13:13.123 --> 13:15.683
Still haven't got a newspaper
around here, huh?

13:15.759 --> 13:20.288
No, but we have a gossip
about every 20 feet.

13:20.364 --> 13:23.766
Why did you come into town
the back way?

13:23.834 --> 13:25.632
You figuring
on trouble?

13:25.703 --> 13:29.299
There's always somebody
looking for some.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.968
Clearwater's no different
than any other town,

13:32.042 --> 13:34.637
but that's one thing
I don't want, Billy...

13:34.712 --> 13:35.712
trouble.

13:38.549 --> 13:40.711
How long you
planning to stay?

13:40.784 --> 13:43.720
Well, I don't know.
I just got here.

13:43.787 --> 13:45.722
People usually let
you take your hat off

13:45.789 --> 13:47.280
a-fore they
ask you to leave.

13:47.358 --> 13:50.988
Well, I'm not asking
you to leave, John.

13:51.061 --> 13:53.758
I'm just asking how long
you figure to stay.

13:53.831 --> 13:56.995
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't stay?

13:57.067 --> 13:58.228
Well, uh, yes.

13:58.302 --> 14:00.862
As a matter of fact,
there's a couple of reasons.

14:00.938 --> 14:04.932
For one, this ain't
your home anymore, John.

14:05.008 --> 14:07.307
You gave that up
some years ago.

14:07.378 --> 14:09.779
Go on.

14:09.847 --> 14:13.943
And two, another man
came to town today.

14:14.017 --> 14:17.112
I understand he's real good
with a gun.

14:17.187 --> 14:18.450
Who is he?

14:18.522 --> 14:21.458
I don't know.
He's a stranger.

14:21.525 --> 14:24.495
But I understand
he hires out.

14:24.561 --> 14:29.795
And three,
I've got myself a young deputy.

14:29.867 --> 14:32.632
He's real conscientious
about his job.

14:34.705 --> 14:37.072
Am I wanted
for anything, Billy?

14:37.141 --> 14:38.302
No.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.469
Then I got
a good idea.

14:40.544 --> 14:41.739
Yeah?

14:41.812 --> 14:44.475
You send that conscientious
young deputy of yours

14:44.548 --> 14:46.813
to run that other
fella out of town.

14:46.884 --> 14:50.980
Well, now, I guess
that'd be one way of doing it.

14:51.054 --> 14:55.185
The only thing is, he's not
wanted for anything, either.

14:55.259 --> 14:59.162
I come to town to see
my ma buried, Billy,

14:59.229 --> 15:02.097
and after that, to maybe
say hello to my brothers.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.327
Any objections?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.596
Well, no.

15:05.669 --> 15:06.762
Fine.

15:06.837 --> 15:10.205
You want to see the boys,
go that way.

15:10.274 --> 15:12.209
You won't have to
go through town.

15:12.276 --> 15:14.711
The ranch
is over there.

15:14.778 --> 15:16.610
Not anymore.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.876
Morgan Hastings
owns it now.

15:18.949 --> 15:21.942
Kate was living
in the Lupin place when...

15:22.019 --> 15:23.453
she, uh...

15:23.520 --> 15:24.613
died.

15:36.099 --> 15:39.035
When did that
happen, Billy?

15:39.102 --> 15:42.470
Your pa was killed
about six months ago.

15:42.539 --> 15:44.474
Who did it?

15:44.541 --> 15:47.477
I haven't been
able to find out.

15:52.716 --> 15:53.979
John...

15:56.386 --> 15:58.548
don't do anything
foolish.

15:58.622 --> 16:03.253
You've been trying real hard
not to tell me something, Billy.

16:03.327 --> 16:04.556
What is it?

16:36.193 --> 16:40.289
Hey, you know that man
that didn't get off the train,

16:40.364 --> 16:43.300
the one that you and
I ain't scared of?

16:43.367 --> 16:44.528
What about him?

16:44.601 --> 16:45.694
He's back.

16:45.769 --> 16:47.704
How do you know
it's him?

16:47.771 --> 16:52.072
He's a big fella...
about 6'4", 200 pounds.

16:52.142 --> 16:53.735
Tough-looking.

16:53.810 --> 16:54.971
If there's
any trouble,

16:55.045 --> 16:56.843
make it look like
self-defense.

16:56.914 --> 17:01.409
Now, nobody told me about
John Elder until I got here,

17:01.485 --> 17:04.978
and I ain't about to
let him draw first.

17:05.055 --> 17:08.252
You'll do nothing
unless I tell you to.

17:08.325 --> 17:11.887
All right,
you tell me...

17:11.962 --> 17:14.897
but I'll handle it
my own way.

17:20.503 --> 17:21.938
I knew it.

17:22.005 --> 17:23.940
Now the Elders are
going to be asking

17:24.007 --> 17:25.942
how we got
the old man's place.

17:26.009 --> 17:27.170
Stick to your
bookkeeping.

17:27.243 --> 17:28.439
I'll handle
the Elders.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.447
You know, it's not
going to be easy.

17:30.514 --> 17:31.948
Nothing comes easy.

17:32.015 --> 17:33.950
You want to
own a town,

17:34.017 --> 17:35.952
you got to
put out something.

18:01.878 --> 18:04.814
I was so little when
you and John left...

18:04.881 --> 18:07.817
Is he as fast with a gun
as everyone says?

18:07.884 --> 18:08.884
Fast?

18:08.919 --> 18:11.320
When he was a kid,
he was the fastest.

18:11.388 --> 18:13.721
I was afraid to be
in the same room.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.725
But let me point
one thing out, kid...

18:15.792 --> 18:17.727
That work doesn't
pay too well.

18:17.794 --> 18:20.696
I recommend
my line of work.

18:20.764 --> 18:21.925
Yeah...
larceny.

18:21.999 --> 18:23.433
Well, the hours
are better,

18:23.500 --> 18:25.435
and you get shot
up a lot less.

18:25.502 --> 18:27.437
Just the same,
I wish he'd showed up.

18:27.504 --> 18:29.063
You can stop
wishing.

18:29.139 --> 18:30.139
He's here.

18:48.358 --> 18:49.358
John.

18:49.359 --> 18:50.359
Matt.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.192
Been a long time.

18:52.262 --> 18:54.697
Time ain't made you
any prettier to look at.

18:54.765 --> 18:55.765
Tom!

18:55.766 --> 18:58.133
It hasn't helped
you any, either.

18:58.201 --> 19:00.067
Don't tell me
this is the kid!

19:00.137 --> 19:01.137
Yep.

19:01.138 --> 19:02.401
Kid?
I'm almost 18!

19:02.472 --> 19:03.472
18, huh?

19:03.473 --> 19:04.907
Bud's starting college
this year.

19:04.975 --> 19:06.136
College...
How about that?

19:06.209 --> 19:08.144
When I went
to school,

19:08.211 --> 19:10.646
if anybody got past
4 plus 4 is 8,

19:10.714 --> 19:11.714
I cried.

19:11.715 --> 19:12.715
Well, Ma...

19:12.716 --> 19:15.652
Ma said she
wanted me to go.

19:15.719 --> 19:16.914
Yeah.

19:21.491 --> 19:23.426
You, uh, got here
a little late, John.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.758
We just got back
from the funeral.

19:25.829 --> 19:27.627
Well, I was
there, Matt,

19:27.698 --> 19:29.428
watching from a hill.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.434
Katie wouldn't have
wanted any trouble.

19:31.501 --> 19:34.767
Oh, it never
stopped you before.

19:34.838 --> 19:36.397
How did she die?

19:36.473 --> 19:39.932
Well, Doc Isdell said
she just wore herself out.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.945
She had a stroke
and couldn't talk,

19:42.012 --> 19:44.948
then the preacher
wrote you them letters.

19:45.015 --> 19:48.281
I came back to see her
about three years ago.

19:48.351 --> 19:51.480
Yeah, for money to put into
that hardware business.

19:51.555 --> 19:53.888
At least I came.
That's more than you did.

19:53.957 --> 19:55.892
It didn't matter
to Katie about me.

19:55.959 --> 19:57.621
I never was
her favorite.

19:57.694 --> 20:00.459
Well, it seems
that you and Bud

20:00.530 --> 20:04.797
were the only ones that saw Ma
in the last few years.

20:04.868 --> 20:08.669
Like Matt says,
I've been away, too.

20:08.739 --> 20:11.299
Yeah, well...

20:16.046 --> 20:18.311
Is it true what
they say about you?

20:18.381 --> 20:21.317
Only the bad things, Bud.

20:21.384 --> 20:23.979
How many men
have you killed?

20:24.054 --> 20:25.989
You better
ask Tom that.

20:26.056 --> 20:28.992
He seems to know
more about me than I do,

20:29.059 --> 20:30.288
and that's
pretty smart,

20:30.360 --> 20:32.761
considering we haven't seen
each other for 10 years.

20:32.829 --> 20:35.822
Well, I'm asking you.
How many?

20:35.899 --> 20:37.993
What did Katie
tell you?

20:38.068 --> 20:40.503
Not Mom,
other people.

20:52.582 --> 20:53.845
Whoa.

21:01.191 --> 21:02.625
Well, howdy,
Miss Gordon.

21:02.692 --> 21:03.785
Hello, Bud.

21:05.862 --> 21:07.797
Miss Mary runs
a boardinghouse.

21:07.864 --> 21:09.298
These are my
brothers, ma'am...

21:09.365 --> 21:11.459
Hello, Matt... Tom.

21:11.534 --> 21:12.968
Hello, John.

21:13.036 --> 21:14.971
It's been
a long time.

21:16.706 --> 21:19.141
Say, you're not that
skinny little kid

21:19.209 --> 21:21.906
that lived next to
the Fergusons, are you?

21:21.978 --> 21:22.978
No.

21:23.046 --> 21:24.981
I'm the skinny
little kid

21:25.048 --> 21:28.143
who lived next door
to the Mastersons.

21:28.218 --> 21:30.153
I hate to break in
on your grief,

21:30.220 --> 21:32.155
but you'll need
some food.

21:32.222 --> 21:34.487
Katie asked me
to look in on you...

21:34.557 --> 21:37.755
if you came
to the funeral.

21:37.827 --> 21:40.661
That's, uh, mighty
nice of you, ma'am.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.665
I wasn't doing
it for you,

21:42.732 --> 21:44.496
or any of you.

21:44.567 --> 21:47.162
I'm doing it because
Katie asked me to.

21:56.079 --> 21:58.810
She liked
that rocker.

22:01.017 --> 22:02.610
She seemed to
have confided

22:02.685 --> 22:04.950
a great deal in you,
Miss Gordon.

22:05.021 --> 22:07.957
Maybe if she'd had
some of her sons around her,

22:08.024 --> 22:10.459
she wouldn't have had
to confide in strangers.

22:10.527 --> 22:12.962
She told me what
fine men you were...

22:13.029 --> 22:14.463
never forgetting
your mother,

22:14.531 --> 22:15.965
sending her money
regular,

22:16.032 --> 22:18.467
helping her send
Bud through school.

22:18.535 --> 22:21.130
She was so
proud of you...

22:21.204 --> 22:22.638
her tall sons,

22:22.705 --> 22:24.640
for whom she kept
making up lies

22:24.707 --> 22:26.801
so she could
hide her shame.

22:26.876 --> 22:29.311
Blamed Texas for
taking her sons.

22:31.047 --> 22:34.313
"Texas is a woman,"
she used to say,

22:34.384 --> 22:37.479
"a big, wild,
beautiful woman.

22:37.554 --> 22:41.321
You get a kid raised up
to where he's got some size,

22:41.391 --> 22:42.825
and there's Texas,

22:42.892 --> 22:44.986
whispering in his ear
and smiling,

22:45.061 --> 22:47.997
saying, 'Come on out with me
and have some fun.'"

22:48.064 --> 22:49.999
"It's hard enough
to raise children anyplace,"

22:50.066 --> 22:51.066
she'd say,

22:51.067 --> 22:53.002
"but when you got
to fight Texas,

22:53.069 --> 22:55.504
a mother
hasn't a chance."

22:55.572 --> 22:58.007
That's why she
pushed Bud so hard.

22:58.074 --> 23:00.942
She let Texas beat her
with the rest of you.

23:01.010 --> 23:05.106
She was going to see
Bud through college or die.

23:05.181 --> 23:07.946
Well... she died.

23:08.017 --> 23:09.315
Miss Gordon?

23:09.385 --> 23:13.288
Tell me, why did she set
so much store by this rocker?

23:13.356 --> 23:16.292
Your pa gave it
to her as a present.

23:16.359 --> 23:19.090
She wouldn't have swapped it
for a diamond ring.

23:19.162 --> 23:21.961
Well, thanks
for being so...

23:22.031 --> 23:23.499
nice to her.

23:23.566 --> 23:25.797
Nice to her?

23:25.868 --> 23:29.305
More like she was nice to me,
or anybody.

23:29.372 --> 23:32.035
She deserved better
from her own.

23:43.052 --> 23:45.612
Miss Gordon, we...

23:45.688 --> 23:48.624
I see you're still
wearing your gun.

24:21.457 --> 24:23.050
Anybody hungry?

24:26.529 --> 24:29.966
Hey, I'll bet you 10 to 1
she's a good cook, too.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.735
Oh. I'm glad
I didn't bet.

24:33.803 --> 24:35.738
I'd have lost.

24:35.805 --> 24:38.570
How did anybody
in this... family

24:38.641 --> 24:40.075
ever get to college?

24:40.143 --> 24:42.578
Well, I didn't want
to go to college.

24:42.645 --> 24:44.580
It was either that
or jail.

24:44.647 --> 24:45.647
For what?

24:45.648 --> 24:47.583
They said
I stole a horse.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.585
People are trying
to stick me

24:49.652 --> 24:51.917
with things like that
all the time.

24:51.988 --> 24:53.251
Did you steal it?

24:53.322 --> 24:55.757
I rode him, but I
didn't steal him.

24:55.825 --> 24:57.259
Ma wouldn't
back me up.

24:57.326 --> 24:59.591
She'd been after me
to go anyway,

24:59.662 --> 25:00.994
so I went.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.657
You went where?

25:02.732 --> 25:04.667
To the School of Mines.

25:04.734 --> 25:06.327
It was September
the 3rd.

25:06.402 --> 25:07.836
The train got to go

25:07.904 --> 25:09.338
the week
before school started,

25:09.405 --> 25:11.340
and I went
to Colorado Springs

25:11.407 --> 25:12.670
and clumb Pikes Peak.

25:12.742 --> 25:13.742
Why?

25:13.743 --> 25:15.006
Well, it was there.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.341
Just a minute.

25:16.412 --> 25:18.347
You done what
to Pikes Peak?

25:18.414 --> 25:19.677
I clumb it.

25:19.749 --> 25:20.978
Not clumb. Climbed.

25:21.050 --> 25:23.451
What's the difference?
I got to the top.

25:23.519 --> 25:24.782
There's
lots of difference.

25:24.854 --> 25:26.823
There ain't no such
word as clumb.

25:26.889 --> 25:28.152
What
about the horse?

25:28.224 --> 25:30.318
She went
to a lot of bother

25:30.393 --> 25:31.827
to get you an education.

25:31.894 --> 25:33.328
Why don't you use it?

25:33.396 --> 25:35.331
Why did you
steal the horse?

25:35.398 --> 25:36.661
I didn't steal it.

25:36.733 --> 25:37.996
I was in bed,

25:38.067 --> 25:39.501
and I heard
someone talking,

25:39.569 --> 25:41.504
so I looked
out the window.

25:41.571 --> 25:44.006
It was old man Hyselman
yammering at Ma,

25:44.073 --> 25:46.008
claiming I stole
his gray horse.

25:46.075 --> 25:48.340
A gray horse?
What did Katie say?

25:48.411 --> 25:49.845
Well, she jawed
right back,

25:49.912 --> 25:52.347
told him to go look
if he wanted.

25:52.415 --> 25:53.849
They went in the barn,

25:53.916 --> 25:56.181
and darned if he
didn't come out

25:56.252 --> 25:57.515
leading his horse.

25:57.587 --> 25:59.852
Ma hanging her head,
saying, "Yes, sir."

25:59.922 --> 26:01.788
Then she come in
all scared.

26:01.858 --> 26:02.858
Ma scared?

26:02.859 --> 26:04.794
I never saw her
like that.

26:04.861 --> 26:07.797
She said he was coming
back with the sheriff

26:07.864 --> 26:10.299
and I'd better get
out of the state.

26:10.366 --> 26:11.800
I took off my pants,

26:11.868 --> 26:13.302
put on my blue suit,

26:13.369 --> 26:14.803
and left
on the train.

26:14.871 --> 26:16.931
That ain't
much of a story.

26:17.006 --> 26:19.942
I liked the part
where he changed his pants.

26:20.009 --> 26:22.274
I was just starting
to get interested.

26:22.345 --> 26:24.280
Oh, very funny.
Ha ha.

26:24.347 --> 26:25.610
Oh...

26:25.681 --> 26:27.946
funny.

26:28.017 --> 26:29.451
Bud,

26:29.519 --> 26:32.284
how long did Ma
live here?

26:32.355 --> 26:33.789
Well...

26:33.856 --> 26:37.122
we moved over
just after Pa died.

26:37.193 --> 26:40.960
1,200 acres
of the best land anywhere.

26:41.030 --> 26:42.464
I wonder
why she sold.

26:42.532 --> 26:45.468
A woman couldn't run
a big spread by herself.

26:45.535 --> 26:47.470
It must have
brought some money.

26:47.537 --> 26:49.802
Let's go to the bank,
settle up.

26:49.872 --> 26:51.306
We'll split it
four ways.

26:51.374 --> 26:53.468
3 1/2 would be
more like it.

26:53.543 --> 26:54.977
Bud needs money
for college.

26:55.044 --> 26:56.979
I ain't going
back to college.

26:57.046 --> 26:58.537
I'm going with him.

26:58.614 --> 27:00.810
There's just one little thing
you're forgetting...

27:00.883 --> 27:02.681
You ain't been invited.

27:02.752 --> 27:04.186
I'd take you
with me,

27:04.253 --> 27:06.518
but I don't know
where I'm going.

27:06.589 --> 27:08.854
I ain't going where
I've already been.

27:08.925 --> 27:10.860
I can take care
of myself.

27:10.927 --> 27:13.362
What do you say
we settle everything first

27:13.429 --> 27:14.863
and talk about him
later?

27:14.931 --> 27:16.365
Now you're talking.

28:20.763 --> 28:22.197
First we better
find out

28:22.265 --> 28:23.699
if she left
any debts.

28:23.766 --> 28:24.859
Debts?

28:24.934 --> 28:26.300
What debts?

28:26.369 --> 28:27.803
The funeral,
for one thing.

28:27.870 --> 28:30.135
Which one of you
paid for that?

28:30.206 --> 28:32.641
She probably owes
a debt at the store.

28:32.708 --> 28:33.971
That can't
be much.

28:34.043 --> 28:35.306
Tom, I'm going
to Hyselman's.

28:35.378 --> 28:37.643
You and Bud
go to Peevey's store.

28:37.713 --> 28:39.648
Matt, you talk
to Dr. Isdell.

28:39.715 --> 28:41.650
We'll meet
back at the bank.

29:01.402 --> 29:03.337
Well, howdy, Bud.

29:03.404 --> 29:04.838
You don't look
any different

29:04.905 --> 29:07.170
than when you first
went to college.

29:07.241 --> 29:09.176
I expected him
to come back

29:09.243 --> 29:11.508
with a flat hat
with a tassel

29:11.579 --> 29:12.842
and wearing glasses,
maybe,

29:12.913 --> 29:14.347
and looking
kind of smart.

29:14.415 --> 29:16.475
Mr. Peevey, you remember
my brother Tom?

29:16.550 --> 29:17.550
Howdy.

29:17.551 --> 29:19.986
I was sorry to hear
about your ma.

29:20.054 --> 29:22.319
There ain't much
a man can say,

29:22.390 --> 29:23.653
excepting I miss her

29:23.724 --> 29:26.159
as much as I'd miss
my own ma.

29:26.227 --> 29:28.492
We came to see
about Ma's bill.

29:28.562 --> 29:29.996
We'd like
to settle up.

29:30.064 --> 29:32.329
Oh. I think
I have it inside.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.663
Come right in.

29:33.734 --> 29:36.329
Let me see now.

29:36.404 --> 29:37.667
Here it is.

29:37.738 --> 29:39.172
Well,
how much is that?

29:39.240 --> 29:40.503
$6.20.

29:40.574 --> 29:42.008
I'll cut you for it.

29:42.076 --> 29:43.669
High card,
double or nothing.

29:49.684 --> 29:51.118
Hey, Ma!

29:51.185 --> 29:52.278
Yes, sonny?

29:52.353 --> 29:54.788
How much were those dresses
Katie Elder made?

29:54.855 --> 29:56.289
I thought
you paid her.

29:56.357 --> 29:58.792
No, dear. I haven't
paid for them yet.

29:58.859 --> 29:59.859
Why not?

29:59.860 --> 30:02.091
The Elder boys
want to settle up.

30:02.163 --> 30:04.098
4 dresses,
2.50 apiece,

30:04.165 --> 30:07.101
and 2 guitar lessons
at 50 cents apiece.

30:07.168 --> 30:09.103
4 dresses
at 2.50 apiece

30:09.170 --> 30:12.436
and 2 guitar lessons
at 50 cents.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.101
That means
that I owe you

30:15.176 --> 30:16.176
$4.80.

30:19.847 --> 30:21.440
Your ma
took guitar lessons?

30:21.515 --> 30:23.450
I figured,
in her old age,

30:23.517 --> 30:24.951
she could
earn a living

30:25.019 --> 30:26.954
playing the guitar
in the saloon.

30:27.021 --> 30:28.284
Want to hear her?

30:28.356 --> 30:29.790
No, thank you,
Mr. Peevey.

30:29.857 --> 30:31.120
Some other time.

30:31.192 --> 30:32.626
Oh. Don't forget
your money.

30:34.195 --> 30:35.458
Thank you.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.122
Drop in anytime.

30:42.036 --> 30:43.971
I wish
I could tell you

30:44.038 --> 30:46.303
that you owed me
a hundred dollars,

30:46.374 --> 30:47.637
but you don't.

30:47.708 --> 30:49.643
She came in here
one day

30:49.710 --> 30:51.975
with a big gray
horse to sell.

30:52.046 --> 30:54.481
She said, "Henry, go
get your gray horse."

30:54.548 --> 30:57.484
Well, sir, they made
as pretty a matched team

30:57.551 --> 30:59.486
as you ever want to see,

30:59.553 --> 31:01.920
so I said, "What's
your price, Katie?"

31:01.989 --> 31:04.151
She said, "One funeral."

31:04.225 --> 31:07.161
And I... I said, "Whose?"

31:07.228 --> 31:10.164
She said, "Mine."
That's the way it was.

31:10.231 --> 31:13.668
That the same gray horse
that Bud stole?

31:14.902 --> 31:16.165
You heard about that?

31:16.237 --> 31:17.330
Yeah.

31:17.405 --> 31:19.340
Katie and I
rigged that up

31:19.407 --> 31:21.672
to scare Bud
into going to college.

31:21.742 --> 31:24.177
I put that horse
in her barn myself

31:24.245 --> 31:26.510
and come back yelling
like a Comanche.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.015
Her screaming back at me
like she was...

31:29.083 --> 31:32.178
Oh, she was a wise one,
your ma.

31:32.253 --> 31:35.018
And my dad...

31:35.089 --> 31:37.854
you buried him,
too.

31:37.925 --> 31:39.291
Didn't you, Henry?

31:40.361 --> 31:41.454
Yeah.

31:41.529 --> 31:42.963
High-spirited, he was.

31:43.030 --> 31:45.966
He wasn't a man
to back down to anyone.

31:46.033 --> 31:47.296
I remember the time

31:47.368 --> 31:50.304
he was challenged
by old Thad to a duel...

31:50.371 --> 31:52.306
your daddy being
the challenged body,

31:52.373 --> 31:53.807
he had
choice of weapons.

31:53.874 --> 31:55.604
It being
the 4th of July,

31:55.676 --> 31:57.577
he says,
calm as you please,

31:57.645 --> 31:58.874
"I choose
Roman candles."

32:00.714 --> 32:02.376
Well, sir,

32:02.450 --> 32:04.885
they stepped off
the 10 paces,

32:04.952 --> 32:07.217
lit the Roman candles
with the cigars,

32:07.288 --> 32:08.551
and
they started popping.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.056
Old Thad
dark as thunder,

32:10.124 --> 32:11.387
Bass
laughing and yelling.

32:11.459 --> 32:13.394
Blue and red
balls of fire

32:13.461 --> 32:14.724
bouncing off him.

32:14.795 --> 32:16.058
Him laughing so hard,

32:16.130 --> 32:18.065
he's missing Thad
by 6 feet.

32:18.132 --> 32:20.397
Finally, one of those
balls of fire

32:20.468 --> 32:22.061
landed in your daddy's
pants.

32:22.136 --> 32:23.900
He grabs his bottom,

32:23.971 --> 32:25.564
ran for the watering
trough,

32:25.639 --> 32:28.040
and set down in it.

32:29.610 --> 32:31.545
Ha ha ha!

32:31.612 --> 32:34.707
It was the funniest duel
I ever saw.

32:34.782 --> 32:36.375
I declare it was.

32:37.618 --> 32:39.553
How'd he die, Henry?

32:42.790 --> 32:44.884
Uh...

32:44.959 --> 32:46.393
from what I could see,

32:46.460 --> 32:48.895
it was from being
shot in the back.

32:48.963 --> 32:51.398
Did anybody ever
find out who did it?

32:52.967 --> 32:55.232
I don't know anything
about those things.

32:55.302 --> 32:57.237
Better ask Billy
or Ben Latta.

32:59.974 --> 33:02.170
All right, Henry.

33:16.924 --> 33:19.359
I figured
he'd go to the bank

33:19.426 --> 33:20.860
and maybe to the store.

33:20.928 --> 33:24.365
I wonder what he was doing
at Hyselman's so long.

33:24.431 --> 33:26.366
You want me
to ask him?

33:26.433 --> 33:28.026
Yeah. Wouldn't hurt
to ask.

33:28.102 --> 33:30.537
But just talk.

33:52.126 --> 33:53.389
Well...

34:13.914 --> 34:15.007
Mr. Venner.

34:16.417 --> 34:18.010
Come in.

34:18.085 --> 34:21.021
Looks like you were
expecting us.

34:21.088 --> 34:23.523
I thought
you might stop by.

34:31.098 --> 34:33.033
Yes, sir.
We came over

34:33.100 --> 34:34.534
to settle
the estate.

34:34.601 --> 34:36.195
There's nothing
left to settle.

34:38.606 --> 34:39.801
Nothing?

34:39.873 --> 34:42.034
She didn't leave
a dollar.

34:42.109 --> 34:43.873
She had money
here last year.

34:43.944 --> 34:45.378
She paid
for my schooling.

34:46.447 --> 34:47.880
She must have
left something.

34:47.947 --> 34:49.210
She must have
gotten something

34:49.283 --> 34:50.545
out
of the old place.

34:50.618 --> 34:52.018
That
what she told you?

34:52.085 --> 34:53.349
She never
said anything.

34:53.420 --> 34:54.853
I took it
for granted.

34:54.922 --> 34:56.389
Where'd she
get her money?

34:56.456 --> 34:59.552
Fine time to start worrying.

34:59.627 --> 35:01.994
I watched her struggle
for years...

35:02.062 --> 35:03.997
giving guitar lessons
for coffee,

35:04.064 --> 35:07.262
fancy sewing to pay
for your clothes, Bud.

35:07.334 --> 35:09.269
Never a word out of her,

35:09.336 --> 35:11.100
except to praise you.

35:11.171 --> 35:13.766
Have you looked
into her closet?

35:13.841 --> 35:16.276
At her clothes?

35:16.343 --> 35:18.437
I'll tell you
what you'd find...

35:18.512 --> 35:19.946
one blue dress
for winter

35:20.014 --> 35:22.848
and one gray dress
for summer.

35:22.916 --> 35:24.509
What about
the Lupin place?

35:24.585 --> 35:27.180
She didn't own
the Lupin place.

35:27.254 --> 35:29.689
I... The bank
let her have it

35:29.757 --> 35:32.352
for a roof
over her head.

35:32.426 --> 35:34.019
Of course she paid rent.

35:34.094 --> 35:37.360
Oh, Katie wouldn't take
anything off of anybody.

35:37.431 --> 35:40.367
Not with her sons
sending her money.

35:41.602 --> 35:44.037
Now, if you plan
to stay on here,

35:44.104 --> 35:46.369
you'll find that...
Clearwater's changed.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.375
Big business coming in.

35:49.643 --> 35:52.943
We don't want any
bad reputations around here.

35:54.014 --> 35:55.448
Good day, gentlemen.

35:55.516 --> 35:57.109
Mr. Venner,

35:57.184 --> 35:59.449
what did she do
with the money

35:59.520 --> 36:00.886
she got
from the ranch?

36:00.954 --> 36:03.082
Ma wouldn't just
give that spread away.

36:03.157 --> 36:04.648
I wouldn't
know about that.

36:04.725 --> 36:06.250
Did you keep records?

36:06.326 --> 36:07.589
We had a fire.

36:07.661 --> 36:09.960
Sorry, but I can't remember
every transaction.

36:11.198 --> 36:12.198
Good day.

36:26.980 --> 36:30.576
Every transaction
or just this one?

36:46.333 --> 36:47.333
Well...

36:56.744 --> 36:59.680
I'd be obliged if you'd
use the front entrance.

36:59.747 --> 37:00.942
Your time will come

37:01.014 --> 37:03.108
to be carried out
the other way.

37:08.188 --> 37:10.623
What was John Elder
doing in here?

37:10.691 --> 37:11.691
Talking.

37:13.694 --> 37:16.630
Anyway, I don't see
it's any of your affair.

37:16.697 --> 37:18.131
I'm making it
my affair.

37:18.198 --> 37:19.461
Who are you?

37:19.533 --> 37:21.195
Mr. Hastings
wants to know,

37:21.268 --> 37:23.362
and he sent me
to find out.

37:23.437 --> 37:26.874
I don't care if Mr. Hastings
wants to know.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.533
Oh, yes. I can see

37:28.609 --> 37:31.044
where Mr. Hastings
might be worried

37:31.111 --> 37:33.376
about what I might be
talking about

37:33.447 --> 37:34.710
with Johnny Elder.

37:34.782 --> 37:36.216
So you tell me,
huh?

37:36.283 --> 37:37.512
No, I won't.

37:37.584 --> 37:38.847
Get out of here.

37:38.919 --> 37:40.683
Ha ha ha!

37:41.922 --> 37:43.754
Ha ha ha ha!

37:52.166 --> 37:53.395
Ha ha ha ha!

37:54.468 --> 37:56.494
Ha ha ha ha!

37:57.905 --> 37:58.905
Hey!

38:09.049 --> 38:10.312
You all right?

38:10.384 --> 38:11.477
Yeah.

38:13.887 --> 38:15.355
Who is he?

38:15.422 --> 38:17.857
I don't know. I never
seen him before.

38:17.925 --> 38:19.359
He works
for Morgan Hastings.

38:19.426 --> 38:22.123
He wanted to know
what we were talking about.

38:22.196 --> 38:23.196
Morgan Hastings?

38:23.197 --> 38:24.197
Yeah.

38:24.198 --> 38:26.133
He's a man who moved in,

38:26.200 --> 38:28.431
bent on taking over
the whole county.

38:28.502 --> 38:30.733
He owns your ma's
old place now.

38:30.804 --> 38:32.898
Well,
I came back to...

38:32.973 --> 38:35.909
ask you if you'd see
after Mom's grave

38:35.976 --> 38:37.410
when you
have a chance.

38:37.477 --> 38:40.914
No, no. I'd be obliged
if you'd keep your money.

38:40.981 --> 38:43.212
Looking after Katie
would be a privilege.

38:44.451 --> 38:45.714
Thanks, Henry.

38:46.787 --> 38:48.221
Thank you.

39:00.901 --> 39:02.335
It take you
that long

39:02.402 --> 39:04.337
to give him
a couple bucks?

39:04.404 --> 39:07.340
Let's go take a look
at the old place.

39:07.407 --> 39:08.500
What for?

39:08.575 --> 39:10.669
Let's say I'm homesick.

39:51.784 --> 39:54.276
Boy, everything
sure has changed, hasn't it?

39:54.353 --> 39:56.117
Remember we used
to fool around

39:56.188 --> 39:57.622
on that
big old barn?

39:57.690 --> 39:59.625
Tom, I was only a kid

39:59.692 --> 40:01.957
the time you fell
from the loft.

40:02.027 --> 40:03.290
You weren't even born.

40:03.362 --> 40:04.625
Besides, I was pushed.

40:04.697 --> 40:07.633
Somebody always kept pushing me
out of that loft.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.635
That's 'cause
you bounced so good.

40:09.702 --> 40:11.637
Everybody in the family
kept bragging

40:11.704 --> 40:13.138
about how good
you bounced.

40:13.205 --> 40:15.697
Well, let's bounce on down.

41:04.924 --> 41:05.924
Howdy.

41:05.925 --> 41:08.019
This here
is private property.

41:08.093 --> 41:10.858
We're looking for a man
named Morgan Hastings.

41:10.930 --> 41:12.193
That's my father.

41:12.264 --> 41:13.527
But he's not here.

41:13.599 --> 41:15.363
He won't be back
all day.

41:15.434 --> 41:18.029
Then maybe you could
give us some information.

41:18.103 --> 41:21.039
See, this place
used to be ours,

41:21.106 --> 41:23.371
and now it's yours.

41:23.442 --> 41:25.707
We'd like to ask you
some questions.

41:25.778 --> 41:27.212
I won't answer
any questions.

41:27.279 --> 41:29.214
You better get
off this property.

41:29.281 --> 41:31.614
Wait a minute, sonny.
Don't get riled.

41:31.684 --> 41:33.209
We're not...

41:33.285 --> 41:35.845
I'm ordering you
to get off this property.

41:35.921 --> 41:37.389
Having trouble,
Dave?

41:37.456 --> 41:38.549
Yeah.

41:38.624 --> 41:40.559
No trouble, mister.

41:40.626 --> 41:43.061
I'm John Elder,
and these are my brothers.

41:43.128 --> 41:45.063
I ordered them
off this property,

41:45.130 --> 41:46.564
and they won't go.

41:46.632 --> 41:48.066
That's
not strictly true.

41:48.133 --> 41:50.568
I won't take any more
trouble from you.

41:50.636 --> 41:51.729
Any more trouble?

41:51.804 --> 41:54.239
Him, he worked
a fella over in town,

41:54.306 --> 41:56.741
and now you won't
leave this man's property.

41:56.809 --> 41:58.243
Well, either
you'll leave peaceful,

41:58.310 --> 42:00.575
or I'll put you all
under arrest.

42:00.646 --> 42:03.081
Now I don't think
we'd take too kindly

42:03.148 --> 42:05.379
to being arrested,
mister.

42:05.451 --> 42:07.545
That ain't going
to make much difference

42:07.620 --> 42:09.213
one way or the other.

42:17.296 --> 42:19.390
See? Now we ain't
arrested.

42:19.465 --> 42:21.400
You're going to be
in serious trouble,

42:21.467 --> 42:22.662
resisting an officer.

42:22.735 --> 42:25.000
We're going in
with you, mister,

42:25.070 --> 42:26.333
straighten this out,

42:26.405 --> 42:29.170
but we ain't going in
looking guilty.

42:29.241 --> 42:31.107
Get on your horse.

42:32.177 --> 42:33.440
We'll be back.

42:48.861 --> 42:51.956
Billy. Billy,
you got to see this.

42:52.031 --> 42:53.795
Come on, come on.

43:37.276 --> 43:38.539
What happened,
Ben?

43:38.610 --> 43:40.044
He got a little
careless.

43:40.112 --> 43:42.377
I ordered them
off the Hastings place,

43:42.448 --> 43:43.711
and they jumped me.

43:43.782 --> 43:45.876
We came in
to straighten this out.

43:45.951 --> 43:47.886
He had no right
arresting us.

43:47.953 --> 43:49.216
He's wearing
a badge.

43:49.288 --> 43:50.881
We weren't looking
for trouble,

43:50.956 --> 43:52.424
just some answers.

43:52.491 --> 43:54.926
Next time it might
be a good idea

43:54.994 --> 43:56.758
to wait
till I tell you

43:56.829 --> 43:58.263
to light out
after somebody.

43:58.330 --> 44:00.856
All right, you Elders,
take off.

44:02.101 --> 44:04.036
Go on. I'll talk to Billy.

44:04.103 --> 44:05.366
I'm going with him.

44:11.443 --> 44:12.706
Billy.

44:16.281 --> 44:17.874
Ever since I got home,

44:17.950 --> 44:20.545
somebody's either
asking me to leave

44:20.619 --> 44:22.520
or pulling a gun
on me.

44:22.588 --> 44:24.022
You can't expect
a gunfighter

44:24.089 --> 44:26.024
to be treated
like a hero.

44:26.091 --> 44:27.354
I'm no gunfighter.

44:27.426 --> 44:28.689
You're his brother.

44:28.761 --> 44:30.229
I've seen unfriendly
towns before.

44:30.295 --> 44:31.593
I can handle that.

44:31.663 --> 44:33.598
At Katie's grave,
you said

44:33.665 --> 44:36.362
the last thing
you wanted was trouble.

44:36.435 --> 44:37.869
It's up to you, Billy.

44:37.936 --> 44:40.167
You drive me out,
I'll be back.

44:40.239 --> 44:41.639
That goes for me, too.

44:41.707 --> 44:43.642
Why can't we get
straight answers?

44:43.709 --> 44:45.143
Why didn't you tell us

44:45.210 --> 44:47.145
Bass was shot
in the back?

44:47.212 --> 44:48.646
Does it make
much difference

44:48.714 --> 44:50.649
which direction
the bullet came from?

44:50.716 --> 44:52.810
Yes, if you're
trying to find out

44:52.885 --> 44:54.444
whether he was
murdered or not.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.115
Well, uh, what
do you want to know?

44:57.189 --> 44:59.624
What happened
to our old place?

44:59.691 --> 45:02.559
If Pa sold it, there'd
have been some money.

45:02.628 --> 45:04.392
Not if he
gambled it away.

45:04.463 --> 45:05.897
Is that
what happened?

45:05.964 --> 45:07.227
Hastings says so,

45:07.299 --> 45:09.734
and I see no reason
to doubt him.

45:09.802 --> 45:12.636
He had six witnesses
to prove it.

45:12.704 --> 45:16.641
Your, uh, your pa
must have been pretty drunk.

45:16.708 --> 45:20.645
He was going to be
a better provider for Katie,

45:20.712 --> 45:22.305
win a fortune
for her.

45:22.381 --> 45:25.146
I don't know how
she put up with him.

45:25.217 --> 45:26.480
She loved him.

45:26.552 --> 45:28.680
That was enough
for her.

45:28.754 --> 45:31.189
We all loved him,
Billy.

45:31.256 --> 45:33.691
It's just that when he
got to gambling,

45:33.759 --> 45:35.523
hitting that bottle...

45:35.594 --> 45:37.529
How long after
that card game

45:37.596 --> 45:38.859
was he shot?

45:38.931 --> 45:40.194
Same night.

45:40.265 --> 45:41.699
Well, now,
wouldn't you say

45:41.767 --> 45:44.327
that was a little
coincidental, Billy?

45:44.403 --> 45:45.666
Well, now, uh...

45:45.737 --> 45:48.172
even if I did,
I couldn't prove it.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.674
Maybe
we can help you.

45:49.741 --> 45:51.175
I don't need
any help.

45:51.243 --> 45:53.178
And isn't it
a little late

45:53.245 --> 45:54.679
to be wondering
what happened?

45:54.746 --> 45:56.180
Who shot him, Billy?

45:56.248 --> 45:58.342
John, uh...

45:58.417 --> 46:00.010
stop digging around.

46:00.085 --> 46:02.111
All it'll get you
is trouble.

46:05.190 --> 46:06.624
Trouble.

46:08.527 --> 46:09.790
Hastings.

46:25.544 --> 46:27.979
Miss Gordon,
I, uh...

46:28.046 --> 46:31.380
want to talk to you
about, uh, Katie's things.

46:31.450 --> 46:32.713
Didn't have much,

46:32.784 --> 46:34.047
but we'd be pleased,

46:34.119 --> 46:37.055
and I'm sure
she'd want you to have...

46:37.122 --> 46:39.489
anything of hers
that you liked,

46:39.558 --> 46:40.821
like...

46:40.893 --> 46:42.293
maybe
the rocking chair

46:42.361 --> 46:43.761
and things
like that.

46:44.830 --> 46:46.594
Why,
thank you, John.

46:46.665 --> 46:48.896
I'd like that
very much.

46:48.967 --> 46:51.402
Fine. Well...

46:51.470 --> 46:52.733
I'll bring them by.

46:59.111 --> 47:00.477
I can't stand a man

47:00.546 --> 47:01.980
that forces himself
on a girl

47:02.047 --> 47:04.209
who wouldn't be caught dead
with him.

47:10.789 --> 47:14.226
They're sure a fine pair,
Mr. Hastings.

47:14.293 --> 47:15.886
The finest.

47:19.264 --> 47:21.631
Southern hospitality, huh?

47:21.700 --> 47:22.963
Sorry, sir.

47:23.035 --> 47:24.970
I was just
feeling the balance

47:25.037 --> 47:27.097
of this
beautiful weapon.

47:27.172 --> 47:29.698
Finest brace of dueling pistols
ever made.

47:29.775 --> 47:31.710
You're two
of the Elder boys.

47:31.777 --> 47:33.075
That's right.

47:33.145 --> 47:34.909
I'm sorry
about your mother.

47:34.980 --> 47:36.414
She was
a wonderful woman.

47:36.481 --> 47:37.481
Just wonderful.

47:37.482 --> 47:38.482
Thank you.

47:38.483 --> 47:40.418
After your father
lost the ranch

47:40.485 --> 47:41.748
and passed on,

47:41.820 --> 47:44.255
I offered to pay her
for the ranch,

47:44.323 --> 47:46.315
but she wouldn't
hear of it.

47:46.391 --> 47:48.826
Well, now, why
would you do that?

47:48.894 --> 47:51.489
Guilt, Mr. Elder.

47:51.563 --> 47:53.498
Yes. Guilt.

47:53.565 --> 47:54.999
I wanted the ranch,
yes.

47:55.067 --> 47:56.160
I needed it.

47:56.235 --> 47:58.670
This town can grow
and become important,

47:58.737 --> 48:01.104
but it needs water power
for a mill.

48:01.173 --> 48:03.108
The ranch had
the water power,

48:03.175 --> 48:05.770
but I...
intended to buy it,

48:05.844 --> 48:07.608
not...

48:07.679 --> 48:09.614
win it
in a card game.

48:09.681 --> 48:12.116
Well, Mr. Hastings,
no offense meant,

48:12.184 --> 48:14.119
but could we
see the paper

48:14.186 --> 48:15.449
that transferred
the ranch?

48:15.520 --> 48:17.148
Certainly. Of course.

48:17.222 --> 48:19.157
You have every right to.

48:20.225 --> 48:21.989
Why, it's right here.

48:31.570 --> 48:34.005
Yes. Here it is.

48:34.072 --> 48:36.507
This is where your father
made his mark.

48:36.575 --> 48:37.838
He couldn't write,
remember?

48:37.909 --> 48:40.344
And the signatures
of the other witnesses.

48:42.581 --> 48:44.379
You're one of these
witnesses?

48:44.449 --> 48:45.449
Of course.

48:46.918 --> 48:49.854
All the rest of these witnesses
work for you?

48:49.921 --> 48:51.014
Occasionally,
yes.

48:51.089 --> 48:53.354
What was the game
you were playing

48:53.425 --> 48:55.360
the night
Dad lost the ranch?

48:55.427 --> 48:57.191
The game?
Oh, blackjack.

48:57.262 --> 48:59.197
Blackjack?

48:59.264 --> 49:01.130
You sure
it was blackjack?

49:01.199 --> 49:02.462
Of course I'm sure.

49:02.534 --> 49:04.799
You know what Pa
always told us...

49:04.870 --> 49:07.135
He wouldn't be caught
dead playing blackjack.

49:07.205 --> 49:09.470
Shoot the first
one of his kids

49:09.541 --> 49:10.804
he saw playing it.

49:10.876 --> 49:12.469
Thought
it was a woman's game.

49:12.544 --> 49:13.978
Tell me, Mr., uh, Hastings,

49:14.046 --> 49:16.481
you know all the people
in this town.

49:16.548 --> 49:18.983
Who do you think
was the dirty rat

49:19.051 --> 49:20.485
that killed our pa?

49:20.552 --> 49:23.147
Why ask me?

49:23.221 --> 49:25.656
Well, we aim
to find out.

49:31.797 --> 49:33.231
The way
I remember it,

49:33.298 --> 49:35.233
we started playing
blackjack with Pa

49:35.300 --> 49:37.064
when we were 3 or 4.

49:37.135 --> 49:38.569
Yeah, well,
we know that,

49:38.637 --> 49:39.900
but Hastings doesn't.

49:40.972 --> 49:41.972
Oh.

50:22.447 --> 50:23.710
Hey, Bud.

50:49.141 --> 50:51.235
"Katie Duane...

50:51.309 --> 50:55.076
born Ohio." No date.

50:55.147 --> 51:00.347
"Married Bass Elder,
September 8, 1850,

51:00.419 --> 51:02.354
Clearwater, Texas."

51:04.089 --> 51:05.523
We better keep this.

51:05.590 --> 51:08.185
Why?
Let's raffle it off.

51:08.260 --> 51:11.355
So we'll give
half the money to the parson.

51:11.430 --> 51:15.197
Listen, I think
we ought to get her a nice stone

51:15.267 --> 51:16.530
for her grave.

51:16.601 --> 51:18.695
A big stone
with nice writing,

51:18.770 --> 51:20.204
what you call a...

51:20.272 --> 51:21.071
A monument.

51:21.072 --> 51:21.806
A monument.

51:21.807 --> 51:23.070
She'd like
a monument.

51:23.141 --> 51:25.440
Why spend money
for a hunk of stone?

51:25.510 --> 51:27.308
Because
it seems to me

51:27.379 --> 51:29.974
there ought to be something
to remember her by.

51:30.048 --> 51:31.641
The Ritters
got their mother

51:31.716 --> 51:33.027
a marble angel
pointing her finger.

51:33.051 --> 51:34.051
At who?

51:34.052 --> 51:35.987
Nobody.
Pointing up, like this.

51:36.054 --> 51:37.488
O.K. A marble angel.

51:37.556 --> 51:40.492
Does it have to
be an angel?

51:40.559 --> 51:42.323
Besides, take
the Ritters' angel...

51:42.394 --> 51:44.329
some kid shot
her finger off.

51:44.396 --> 51:46.661
Now it looks like
she's shaking her fist.

51:46.731 --> 51:48.597
How about
a marble lamb?

51:48.667 --> 51:50.659
How about a horse?

51:50.735 --> 51:51.735
A horse?

51:51.736 --> 51:52.931
For a grave?

51:53.004 --> 51:54.438
Well,
Ma loved horses.

51:54.506 --> 51:55.940
Not <i>that</i> much.

51:56.007 --> 51:59.808
How'd you like a horse
atop you for all eternity?

51:59.878 --> 52:02.245
What's happened
to all of us?

52:02.314 --> 52:04.408
You said she'd like
a monument.

52:04.483 --> 52:05.917
But not that kind.

52:05.984 --> 52:08.783
She wanted one of us,
her family,

52:08.854 --> 52:10.288
to amount
to something.

52:10.355 --> 52:13.120
Well, she sure drew
a flat blank zero.

52:13.191 --> 52:14.191
Not yet.

52:14.192 --> 52:16.286
Not if Bud goes
back to school.

52:16.361 --> 52:17.361
Hold on.

52:17.362 --> 52:18.955
That's the monument
she wants.

52:19.030 --> 52:21.795
One of you go and
amount to something.

52:21.867 --> 52:23.631
It's too late
for us.

52:23.702 --> 52:25.796
I'm not going to be
no monument.

52:25.871 --> 52:27.305
I'm going with you.

52:27.372 --> 52:29.967
We'll be famous
like the Dalton brothers.

52:30.041 --> 52:31.304
Yeah,
they're famous,

52:31.376 --> 52:33.470
but they're just
a bit dead.

52:33.545 --> 52:34.979
They were hung.

52:35.046 --> 52:36.046
Oh.

52:38.083 --> 52:40.211
We keep the book.

52:46.791 --> 52:48.316
Horses...

53:42.280 --> 53:43.304
John.

53:43.381 --> 53:44.815
Good evening, Mary.

53:44.883 --> 53:46.818
I, uh, brought
the things.

53:46.885 --> 53:48.319
Come on in.

53:51.990 --> 53:53.652
This is a nice room.

53:53.725 --> 53:54.725
Thank you.

53:54.726 --> 53:57.161
How about...

53:57.228 --> 53:58.890
right here?

53:58.964 --> 54:00.933
That's fine.

54:00.999 --> 54:04.766
This is very thoughtful
of you, John.

54:04.836 --> 54:07.931
Whenever I sit in it,
I'll think of Katie.

54:08.006 --> 54:10.271
I brought
your things back,

54:10.342 --> 54:12.277
and also...

54:12.344 --> 54:15.974
we thought you
should have this.

54:19.017 --> 54:21.111
But it's
your family Bible.

54:21.186 --> 54:22.415
You keep it.

54:22.487 --> 54:25.116
No. A lot
of the places I go,

54:25.190 --> 54:26.522
it wouldn't fit in.

54:26.591 --> 54:28.457
All right.
I'll keep it,

54:28.526 --> 54:31.462
but it's yours whenever
you want it back.

54:39.037 --> 54:40.972
These are yours,
too.

54:41.039 --> 54:43.975
I know they weren't meant
for an outsider,

54:44.042 --> 54:47.809
but, well, Katie wanted me
to know about you.

54:47.879 --> 54:49.313
I don't mind.

54:49.381 --> 54:51.646
You stopped writing
so long ago.

54:51.716 --> 54:53.480
One of her
real pleasures

54:53.551 --> 54:55.816
was reading over
your old letters.

54:55.887 --> 54:57.480
After learning them
by heart,

54:57.555 --> 54:59.421
she gave them
to me to read.

54:59.491 --> 55:01.756
It's amazing anyone
could read them.

55:01.826 --> 55:04.455
My handwriting isn't exactly
a thing of beauty.

55:04.529 --> 55:06.589
But what you
wrote was...

55:06.665 --> 55:08.099
at first.

55:08.166 --> 55:11.102
Then I began
to notice a change.

55:11.169 --> 55:14.071
Your ma never did,
but I did.

55:14.139 --> 55:15.607
Everybody changes.

55:15.674 --> 55:18.234
Not the way you did.

55:18.309 --> 55:20.778
When I began hearing
things about you,

55:20.845 --> 55:24.782
it wasn't even the same man
who wrote those letters.

55:24.849 --> 55:27.284
You're hunting who killed
your father, aren't you?

55:27.352 --> 55:28.684
I sure am.

55:28.753 --> 55:31.780
Whoever killed Bass probably
stole the ranch from Katie.

55:31.856 --> 55:34.325
That's the least
I can do for her.

55:34.392 --> 55:37.794
Why, so you can
even a score, kill again,

55:37.862 --> 55:39.626
maybe
in front of Bud

55:39.698 --> 55:41.860
so he can idolize
his tough brother?

55:41.933 --> 55:43.629
Don't let Bud
worship you

55:43.702 --> 55:45.102
because
you're a killer.

55:45.170 --> 55:47.969
All Katie wanted
was Bud to go to college,

55:48.039 --> 55:51.305
to make the Elder name
stand for something.

55:54.345 --> 55:56.075
I'll be leaving now.

55:58.283 --> 56:00.115
Thank you again
for this.

56:04.322 --> 56:09.488
Why wouldn't Katie want me
to find Bass' killer?

56:09.561 --> 56:12.258
Because all that means
is more killing,

56:12.330 --> 56:13.992
and Katie
hated killing.

56:33.685 --> 56:36.280
Bud, how much money
you got on you?

56:36.354 --> 56:39.290
Me? Where would I
get any money?

56:39.357 --> 56:41.958
You got nearly 5 bucks
from Peevey.

56:42.091 --> 56:44.617
Spend my own money
for a drink?

56:44.694 --> 56:46.458
Pa would leave
his grave.

56:46.529 --> 56:50.296
Never spend your own
money for booze, kid.

56:50.366 --> 56:52.301
Watch me.
You just watch.

56:52.368 --> 56:53.734
Two whiskeys.

57:09.819 --> 57:12.345
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

57:13.923 --> 57:15.755
Well... down.

57:23.165 --> 57:24.258
Bartender.

57:24.333 --> 57:25.426
Yes, sir.

57:26.769 --> 57:30.797
Hey, can a fella get
a drink on credit around here?

57:32.341 --> 57:33.809
Sorry.

57:35.511 --> 57:37.446
I'll get us
another drink.

57:56.532 --> 57:59.058
Ah...

57:59.135 --> 58:00.330
a beauty.

58:00.403 --> 58:01.632
We'll get a drink

58:01.704 --> 58:03.138
'cause we're
having a raffle.

58:03.205 --> 58:04.205
Raffle what?

58:04.206 --> 58:06.072
My eye.
My glass eye.

58:06.142 --> 58:09.738
Who wants a chance
on a made-to-order eye?

58:09.812 --> 58:11.246
Now, wait a minute.

58:11.313 --> 58:13.748
If you're that thirsty,
I'll buy the drink.

58:13.816 --> 58:16.251
Thanks, but you
wouldn't accept a drink

58:16.318 --> 58:18.253
if you couldn't
return the favor.

58:18.320 --> 58:19.320
Certainly not.

58:19.321 --> 58:21.256
All right.
50 cents a chance,

58:21.323 --> 58:24.589
just 4 bits
to win a $22 eye.

58:24.660 --> 58:27.095
Why not?
I always wanted a third eye.

58:27.163 --> 58:29.428
You want to play poker
or kid games?

58:29.498 --> 58:32.297
Kid games.
I'm losing money.

58:33.669 --> 58:34.669
I'm in.

58:34.670 --> 58:35.729
All right.

58:35.805 --> 58:38.274
Don't touch it, now.
Look but don't touch.

58:38.340 --> 58:39.340
I'm in.

58:39.341 --> 58:41.606
Yeah. Lay that
money down here.

58:41.677 --> 58:43.612
Never seen
such a thing.

58:43.679 --> 58:45.272
That's 9.

58:45.347 --> 58:46.781
I got 7.

58:46.849 --> 58:48.784
Well, that's 17,
18, 19...

58:48.851 --> 58:50.786
$9.50. I need
one more

58:50.853 --> 58:52.788
for
an even 10 bucks.

58:52.855 --> 58:55.620
There it is.
I want that eye.

58:55.691 --> 58:57.182
All right!

58:57.259 --> 58:58.625
Now, let's see.

58:58.694 --> 59:02.062
We need 19 white chips
and 1 blue one.

59:02.131 --> 59:05.568
The man that draws
the blue chip is the winner

59:05.634 --> 59:07.227
of that beautiful
little eye.

59:07.303 --> 59:08.737
Shake them up
good, Bud.

59:08.804 --> 59:10.067
Who was first in?

59:10.139 --> 59:11.139
I was.

59:11.140 --> 59:12.574
You get first draw.

59:12.641 --> 59:15.076
Let's see who's
the lucky winner...

59:17.146 --> 59:19.741
Well, let's see
who's going to win.

59:19.815 --> 59:21.249
Get in there.

59:21.317 --> 59:23.752
This tall, good-looking
gentleman, go ahead.

59:23.819 --> 59:26.084
See what you
come out with.

59:26.155 --> 59:27.680
Don't just
stand there.

59:27.756 --> 59:29.088
Ha ha ha!

59:29.158 --> 59:31.650
Seem to be
all white chips.

59:31.727 --> 59:33.093
Hold it, hold it.

59:33.162 --> 59:34.755
This gentleman
took two chances.

59:34.830 --> 59:36.765
You're entitled
to two draws.

59:36.832 --> 59:39.267
May Lady Luck
smile on you.

59:39.335 --> 59:40.335
Let's see...

59:40.336 --> 59:41.929
He got it!

59:42.004 --> 59:43.438
I got her!

59:43.506 --> 59:44.599
Give me my eye.

59:44.673 --> 59:46.642
It's over there.
It's over there.

59:52.348 --> 59:54.783
You know, I might
just have it made

59:54.850 --> 59:56.785
into a stick pin
for Sunday.

59:56.852 --> 59:59.287
Ned, how much
will you take for it?

59:59.355 --> 01:00:00.880
Take for
my peeper?

01:00:00.956 --> 01:00:02.618
You'll profit.
How about $3.00?

01:00:02.691 --> 01:00:04.785
No. She's my
good luck piece.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.294
There goes
my wedding.

01:00:06.362 --> 01:00:10.129
My girl saw me with my patch once.
She turned away.

01:00:10.199 --> 01:00:12.293
You look
all right to me.

01:00:12.368 --> 01:00:14.462
Pretend you're a girl,
and you'd understand

01:00:14.537 --> 01:00:17.473
it spoils my manly beauty,
right, boys?

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.974
Sell it back!

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:20.475
All right,
all right!

01:00:20.543 --> 01:00:22.478
I'll sell her,
but $5.00.

01:00:22.545 --> 01:00:25.811
Split the difference
and I'll buy you a drink.

01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:26.974
Done.

01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:28.483
Whiskey
for the gentleman.

01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:31.487
Give me one
and one for the kid.

01:00:31.554 --> 01:00:32.554
There.

01:00:32.555 --> 01:00:33.989
Just a min...

01:00:34.056 --> 01:00:36.992
Aren't you going to
put it back in?

01:00:37.059 --> 01:00:40.996
Put it back? It'd be
a little crowded in there.

01:00:41.063 --> 01:00:42.497
Ha ha ha!

01:00:53.909 --> 01:00:56.003
Maybe that's
funny to you,

01:00:56.078 --> 01:00:57.910
but not to me.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.609
I say you're a liar
and a cheat,

01:01:00.683 --> 01:01:03.243
just like your old man.

01:01:07.523 --> 01:01:09.116
You knew my old man?

01:01:09.191 --> 01:01:11.126
Well enough
to say that.

01:01:11.193 --> 01:01:12.957
He was a drunk, too.

01:01:13.028 --> 01:01:14.028
You're lying!

01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:15.292
He's a kid,
Curley.

01:01:15.364 --> 01:01:16.364
Stay out.

01:01:16.365 --> 01:01:18.800
Guess he thinks
he can ride along

01:01:18.867 --> 01:01:20.130
on his brother's
reputation.

01:01:20.202 --> 01:01:23.764
Frankly, I don't think so much
of his brother, either.

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:25.137
Curley,
he ain't armed.

01:01:25.207 --> 01:01:26.470
But I am.

01:01:26.542 --> 01:01:27.976
Stay out, Bud.

01:01:28.043 --> 01:01:29.102
No!

01:01:29.178 --> 01:01:32.307
I don't think
he's got the nerve.

01:01:32.381 --> 01:01:33.815
Give him a gun.

01:01:33.882 --> 01:01:35.475
He didn't mean
nothing.

01:01:35.551 --> 01:01:37.315
He called me
a liar.

01:01:37.386 --> 01:01:39.480
All I did
was tell the truth.

01:01:39.555 --> 01:01:40.989
Take mine, kid.

01:01:51.233 --> 01:01:52.233
Go on...

01:01:52.234 --> 01:01:53.998
pick it up.

01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:56.129
Heh heh heh...

01:01:56.205 --> 01:01:58.606
He comes from
a no-good family

01:01:58.674 --> 01:02:00.939
that don't have
the nerve...

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.444
John...

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:06.448
this guy just called Pa
a liar and a drunk.

01:02:06.515 --> 01:02:08.780
That invitation
to pick up a gun

01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:10.444
still hold for
Johnny Elder?

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:11.782
You got a chance

01:02:11.854 --> 01:02:15.347
to prove you don't think
so much of him.

01:02:16.792 --> 01:02:19.125
Tom, get him
out of here.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.288
Not till he eats
his words.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:22.363
Tom...

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:23.627
Didn't you hear me?

01:02:23.699 --> 01:02:26.635
He called Pa
a liar and a drunk.

01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:32.975
Well, I reckon
that's what he was, kid.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.313
Now, keep him out.

01:02:45.854 --> 01:02:48.153
Heh heh,
heh heh heh...

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:54.522
Heh heh heh...

01:03:01.603 --> 01:03:03.595
John...

01:03:03.672 --> 01:03:05.265
get out.

01:03:12.948 --> 01:03:13.948
Night, boys.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:19.748
Where you going,
mister?

01:03:21.357 --> 01:03:23.019
Finish your game.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:40.307
Hey, Bud, ain't you
going to eat?

01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:41.376
No!

01:03:41.377 --> 01:03:42.709
How can I eat

01:03:42.778 --> 01:03:45.976
when I think of what that skunk
said about us?

01:03:46.048 --> 01:03:47.107
And him,

01:03:47.182 --> 01:03:50.311
the big gun everybody's
always bragging about.

01:03:50.386 --> 01:03:52.651
Well, he slunk
with his belly dragging

01:03:52.721 --> 01:03:54.485
lower than anyone
in the place.

01:03:54.556 --> 01:03:55.556
Shut up.

01:03:55.557 --> 01:03:56.991
I won't shut up!

01:03:57.059 --> 01:04:00.029
If you wouldn't,
why not let me do something?

01:04:00.095 --> 01:04:03.088
He'd have chewed you up
and spit you out.

01:04:03.165 --> 01:04:04.497
You'd have been dead

01:04:04.566 --> 01:04:06.933
before your hand
got halfway to that gun.

01:04:07.002 --> 01:04:08.265
Another thing...

01:04:08.337 --> 01:04:10.772
Katie'll have something
to show for her life.

01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:12.535
You're going
back to school.

01:04:12.608 --> 01:04:13.837
No, I ain't.

01:04:13.909 --> 01:04:15.343
Oh, yes, you are

01:04:15.411 --> 01:04:18.279
if I have to
hog-tie you.

01:04:18.347 --> 01:04:20.043
I won't learn
anything.

01:04:20.115 --> 01:04:22.107
I can't make you
do that.

01:04:22.184 --> 01:04:24.779
Anyway, you don't want to
tag along with me

01:04:24.853 --> 01:04:27.288
after I've muddied
the Elders' name.

01:04:27.356 --> 01:04:29.450
No, and that's
for sure.

01:04:32.361 --> 01:04:34.930
This was Ma's,
and now it's mine.

01:04:35.063 --> 01:04:37.294
I'm getting that guy.
Who's coming?

01:04:37.365 --> 01:04:38.799
You're not going
anyplace.

01:04:38.867 --> 01:04:40.631
You going
to stop me?

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:42.295
You bet I am,

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.498
and that's
for sure!

01:04:45.874 --> 01:04:47.740
Aah!

01:04:57.986 --> 01:05:00.512
What the hell
did you hit me for?

01:05:00.588 --> 01:05:03.251
You stood there
and let him hit me.

01:05:05.627 --> 01:05:06.856
Oh, kid...

01:05:06.928 --> 01:05:08.021
Whoa-a-a...

01:05:17.339 --> 01:05:19.501
I got him!
I got him!

01:05:19.574 --> 01:05:20.837
I got him!

01:05:22.177 --> 01:05:23.440
You got him?

01:05:23.511 --> 01:05:24.511
Yeah!

01:05:26.247 --> 01:05:27.772
Stay out of here!

01:05:37.659 --> 01:05:38.718
Uhh!

01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:47.526
Howdy.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:49.897
Howdy.

01:05:49.971 --> 01:05:52.964
I'm right sorry
I missed the start of that.

01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:54.976
Doing your spring
housecleaning, eh?

01:05:55.043 --> 01:05:57.308
No. We're just
getting acquainted.

01:05:57.379 --> 01:06:00.907
Haven't seen each other
for some years.

01:06:00.982 --> 01:06:03.747
I'm looking for Kate Elder.
Is she about?

01:06:03.818 --> 01:06:06.083
Well, this is
where she lived.

01:06:06.154 --> 01:06:08.248
We're her sons.

01:06:08.323 --> 01:06:10.758
She died
a few days ago.

01:06:10.825 --> 01:06:12.259
I am sorry.

01:06:12.327 --> 01:06:14.728
I extend my sympathy
to y'all.

01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:15.796
Thank you.

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.765
I never met
Mrs. Elder,

01:06:17.832 --> 01:06:21.769
but I got a letter
from her about a month ago.

01:06:21.836 --> 01:06:23.600
Since I had
business here,

01:06:23.671 --> 01:06:26.106
I decided to
pay her a visit.

01:06:26.174 --> 01:06:28.609
I'm sorry
I got here so late.

01:06:28.676 --> 01:06:30.167
This is some letter.

01:06:30.245 --> 01:06:31.611
Care to read it?

01:06:33.348 --> 01:06:37.444
"Mr. Charlie Bob Striker,
Pecos, Texas."

01:06:37.519 --> 01:06:38.519
That you?

01:06:38.553 --> 01:06:39.987
It is.

01:06:40.055 --> 01:06:43.617
Well, this is Matt,
Bud, and Tom,

01:06:43.691 --> 01:06:45.284
and I'm John Elder.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360
Howdy.

01:06:48.196 --> 01:06:49.630
"Dear Mr. Striker.

01:06:49.697 --> 01:06:54.135
It has been told to me that
you have too many horses.

01:06:54.202 --> 01:06:56.967
If this is true,
you have my sympathy

01:06:57.038 --> 01:07:00.907
as I have been horse-poor
myself in the past.

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:04.412
If you are still in this
predicament in June,

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.744
I may be able
to help you out

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:10.684
and take 100 or even 200 head
off your hands,

01:07:10.752 --> 01:07:13.688
provided you're prepared
to deal on credit

01:07:13.755 --> 01:07:16.919
until I can resell them.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:20.428
I am interested
in good, sound stock

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.589
but nothing fancy,

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:27.261
and I would like to hear
your rock-bottom price.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.270
Yours truly,

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:31.272
Kate Elder."

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:33.001
Horse-poor?

01:07:33.074 --> 01:07:35.600
Sounds like
she had more brass

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:37.942
than a Kansas City
fire engine.

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:39.275
It struck me funny.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:41.816
The more I read it,
the funnier it got.

01:07:41.883 --> 01:07:46.287
Finally I figured I'd done
a lot of fool things in my day,

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:49.290
but I hadn't done any lately,
and I'm overdue.

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:51.417
I'm sorry
I got here late.

01:07:51.493 --> 01:07:54.463
You and Ma would've made
a lively team.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:55.588
Well, thanks.

01:07:55.663 --> 01:07:57.359
Why not
come on in?

01:07:57.432 --> 01:07:58.730
Thanks for
your hospitality,

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.237
but my bad knee
wants me to stay right here.

01:08:02.303 --> 01:08:03.737
I'll be running along.

01:08:03.805 --> 01:08:05.068
Nice meeting you.

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.735
I've got a proposition
for you, Mr. Striker.

01:08:07.809 --> 01:08:10.574
I wouldn't blame you
if you turned me down.

01:08:10.645 --> 01:08:12.079
Wouldn't hurt
to hear it.

01:08:12.147 --> 01:08:14.412
I'd like to take
those 200 head,

01:08:14.482 --> 01:08:15.916
run 'em up
to Colorado,

01:08:15.984 --> 01:08:17.417
sell them
to the miners.

01:08:17.484 --> 01:08:21.081
But I've got the same trouble
Mom had... no cash.

01:08:21.156 --> 01:08:23.716
I'll give you half the profits
for trusting me.

01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:27.283
Well, what about the rest of you?
You in this, too?

01:08:27.362 --> 01:08:28.761
We ain't
been asked.

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:29.830
Well?

01:08:29.831 --> 01:08:31.424
Are you telling
or asking?

01:08:31.499 --> 01:08:32.499
Asking.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.765
Well, sounds crazy enough to work.

01:08:34.836 --> 01:08:35.836
Matt?

01:08:35.837 --> 01:08:37.270
Just one thing...

01:08:37.337 --> 01:08:40.433
We using the money
to keep him in school?

01:08:40.508 --> 01:08:42.033
Seems to be
the idea.

01:08:42.109 --> 01:08:46.946
In that case,
I'll chip in a couple weeks.

01:08:47.015 --> 01:08:48.073
Well?

01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:50.277
You know, you almost
broke my jaw?

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:52.444
I was trying
awful hard to.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.957
That's what it seems to take
with some people.

01:08:58.459 --> 01:09:01.395
Well, I guess you
made up my mind.

01:09:01.462 --> 01:09:02.930
How about it?

01:09:02.997 --> 01:09:05.398
If I was doing it
for your mother,

01:09:05.466 --> 01:09:07.901
I might as well
do it for you.

01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:10.564
Come to Pecos and
the horses are yours.

01:09:10.638 --> 01:09:11.638
Thank you.

01:09:11.639 --> 01:09:12.662
Starting when?

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.573
Take us a little while...
couple hours.

01:09:15.643 --> 01:09:17.077
Good.
I'll be waiting.

01:09:17.145 --> 01:09:18.145
Giddyup.

01:09:23.651 --> 01:09:25.415
Well, come on.

01:09:46.341 --> 01:09:48.332
It's your move, Billy.

01:09:50.612 --> 01:09:52.604
Harry,
one of these days,

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.616
I'm going to
beat you.

01:09:55.683 --> 01:09:57.777
Well, I wish you would.

01:09:57.852 --> 01:10:00.287
After losing eight
games in a row,

01:10:00.355 --> 01:10:03.291
you ain't much of
a challenge anymore.

01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:08.796
Where have you
been all day?

01:10:08.863 --> 01:10:12.300
I been to the
U.S. Marshal's office.

01:10:12.367 --> 01:10:14.302
Take a look at this.

01:10:16.237 --> 01:10:19.639
Maybe that'll prove I wasn't
just jumping to conclusions.

01:10:19.707 --> 01:10:23.303
Tom Elder's
wanted for murder.

01:10:23.378 --> 01:10:25.142
What gave you
the idea?

01:10:25.213 --> 01:10:26.408
I did.

01:10:26.481 --> 01:10:29.815
He knew enough about Tom Elder
to send me looking.

01:10:29.884 --> 01:10:32.820
I figured Tom
for a lot of things,

01:10:32.887 --> 01:10:34.321
but never murder.

01:10:34.389 --> 01:10:36.324
He's an Elder,
isn't he?

01:10:36.391 --> 01:10:39.327
Takes more than a man's name
to make him guilty.

01:10:39.394 --> 01:10:40.828
Well, there's
your proof.

01:10:40.895 --> 01:10:42.329
That proves
he's wanted.

01:10:42.397 --> 01:10:44.161
It doesn't prove
he's guilty.

01:10:44.232 --> 01:10:46.667
You're working
out of pure hate, Ben.

01:10:46.734 --> 01:10:48.669
That's why they
took your gun.

01:10:48.736 --> 01:10:52.673
Seems like I can't do anything
right for you, Billy.

01:11:03.017 --> 01:11:04.451
Ben...

01:11:04.519 --> 01:11:06.454
the trouble
with you is

01:11:06.521 --> 01:11:07.955
you're like an owl.

01:11:08.022 --> 01:11:10.787
The more light
you shine on him,

01:11:10.858 --> 01:11:12.292
the less he sees.

01:11:13.695 --> 01:11:15.129
Where you going?

01:11:15.196 --> 01:11:17.290
I'm going to
get Tom Elder.

01:11:17.365 --> 01:11:19.630
Not armed like that,
you're not.

01:11:19.701 --> 01:11:20.701
Go reluctant.

01:11:20.768 --> 01:11:24.296
Not like you enjoy
the idea of using that.

01:11:26.374 --> 01:11:28.309
I'll go myself.

01:11:28.376 --> 01:11:31.073
There are four
of them.

01:11:31.145 --> 01:11:33.637
I can count, too, Ben.

01:11:38.486 --> 01:11:39.818
Ben's right, Billy.

01:11:39.887 --> 01:11:41.822
You'll need help.

01:11:44.225 --> 01:11:47.161
You, uh, figuring
on coming with me,

01:11:47.228 --> 01:11:52.292
or are you suggesting I take along
that new man you hired?

01:11:52.367 --> 01:11:53.892
He's a good hand.

01:11:55.069 --> 01:11:58.005
What are you trying
to keep the Elders

01:11:58.072 --> 01:12:00.268
from finding out,
Mr. Hastings?

01:12:00.341 --> 01:12:03.004
Well, I'm... I'm just
trying to help.

01:12:03.077 --> 01:12:04.204
Sure.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.440
Just trying to
put us on the map,

01:12:06.514 --> 01:12:08.278
make us all rich.

01:12:08.349 --> 01:12:11.615
A man can grow
with a town, Billy.

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:14.953
Or die...

01:12:15.022 --> 01:12:17.457
like Bass Elder.

01:13:28.595 --> 01:13:30.689
Ben, you better
come here.

01:13:30.764 --> 01:13:31.788
What's up?

01:13:31.865 --> 01:13:34.801
Billy's horse just came in
without him.

01:13:46.046 --> 01:13:48.481
Let's get a posse
together, Harry.

01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:07.926
Here.

01:14:17.844 --> 01:14:19.608
He's still
breathing.

01:14:19.679 --> 01:14:22.274
You and Roy, take him
to Doc Isdell.

01:14:22.349 --> 01:14:24.284
Meet us at the river.

01:14:54.714 --> 01:14:55.909
Yah!

01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:00.849
Yah!

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.980
Yah!

01:15:03.056 --> 01:15:04.718
Hah! Hah!

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.196
Yah!

01:15:15.268 --> 01:15:17.601
Hyah! Hyah!

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:18.670
Bud!

01:15:18.738 --> 01:15:20.798
Go get him!

01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.103
Hyah!

01:15:25.178 --> 01:15:26.441
Hyah!

01:15:26.513 --> 01:15:28.744
Yah-hah!

01:15:32.118 --> 01:15:33.347
Hyah!

01:15:42.095 --> 01:15:43.586
Hah!

01:16:38.551 --> 01:16:40.782
You were pretty good
today, kid,

01:16:40.854 --> 01:16:41.947
pretty handy.

01:16:42.021 --> 01:16:44.149
Where did you
learn that stuff?

01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:45.658
Not in college.

01:16:45.725 --> 01:16:48.786
All we're trying to do is
make you rich and respectable.

01:16:48.862 --> 01:16:51.127
You fight us
every step.

01:16:51.197 --> 01:16:53.632
I don't want to be
rich and respectable.

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.635
I want to be
like you.

01:16:55.702 --> 01:16:57.136
He sassing you again?

01:16:57.203 --> 01:16:59.069
I don't know
what to do.

01:16:59.138 --> 01:17:01.903
Ain't you got no respect
for your elders?

01:17:01.975 --> 01:17:04.376
That ain't funny.
I heard it before.

01:17:04.444 --> 01:17:07.243
Katie would bloody our backsides
with a birch

01:17:07.313 --> 01:17:08.747
for talking back.

01:17:08.815 --> 01:17:10.181
Yeah?

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.048
Well, which
one of you

01:17:12.118 --> 01:17:14.747
is man enough
to fill in for Ma?

01:17:15.922 --> 01:17:17.185
Oh, no.

01:17:17.257 --> 01:17:18.691
Oh, no.
You wouldn't.

01:17:18.758 --> 01:17:20.192
No! Hey! No!

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:21.694
Aw, come on!

01:17:21.761 --> 01:17:23.195
Let me... Hey!

01:17:23.263 --> 01:17:25.255
Put me down!

01:17:42.615 --> 01:17:44.447
Well, fellas,

01:17:44.517 --> 01:17:46.611
I thought
I taught you better

01:17:46.686 --> 01:17:49.520
than to take a bath
with your clothes on.

01:17:49.589 --> 01:17:50.784
Hey!

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:30.263
There's a posse
up there.

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:32.856
What do you suppose
they're after?

01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:36.769
It can't be us

01:18:36.836 --> 01:18:39.271
unless they think
we stole these horses.

01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:42.275
That's Ben Latta there.
They must be after us.

01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:43.776
What will we do?

01:18:43.843 --> 01:18:45.277
We've done
nothing wrong.

01:18:45.345 --> 01:18:47.109
We won't
act like it.

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.115
We'll pick up
these horses

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:51.947
and start out like we're just
passing through.

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.854
There's four of them.

01:18:55.922 --> 01:18:57.923
It's the Elders,
all right.

01:19:09.467 --> 01:19:11.936
Hold fire!
I want them alive.

01:19:12.003 --> 01:19:13.096
Bud.

01:19:13.171 --> 01:19:14.571
I'm all right.

01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:41.265
What's this for?

01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:43.768
Stealing horses
is against the law,

01:19:43.835 --> 01:19:44.928
ain't it?

01:19:45.003 --> 01:19:46.471
So is shooting them.

01:19:46.538 --> 01:19:49.474
We got these legal,
and we can prove it.

01:19:49.541 --> 01:19:52.477
I don't expect
you all to believe us,

01:19:52.544 --> 01:19:54.445
but Billy will.

01:19:54.512 --> 01:19:56.208
Then why did
you shoot him?

01:19:56.281 --> 01:19:58.273
Billy's shot?

01:19:58.350 --> 01:20:00.581
Shot, but not dead.

01:20:00.652 --> 01:20:03.087
He'll tell us
who did it

01:20:03.154 --> 01:20:05.623
when he tried
to bring Tom in.

01:20:15.633 --> 01:20:17.067
This doesn't make sense.

01:20:17.135 --> 01:20:19.969
If we were running away
and had shot Billy,

01:20:20.038 --> 01:20:22.974
why would we stop
to pick up this herd?

01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:25.340
And bring them back
through Clearwater.

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.777
Throw your guns
on the ground.

01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:34.485
Well, do as he says.

01:20:34.552 --> 01:20:36.987
More killings
won't prove anything.

01:20:41.259 --> 01:20:43.660
Couple of you
tie them up.

01:20:49.667 --> 01:20:51.499
We got
all them horses.

01:20:51.569 --> 01:20:53.834
Their legal owner
will find them.

01:20:53.905 --> 01:20:56.306
We got a letter
from the owner.

01:20:56.374 --> 01:20:57.933
That don't help Billy.

01:20:58.009 --> 01:20:59.637
We didn't do it.

01:20:59.711 --> 01:21:02.647
Billy just happened to be at
the Lupin place when he was shot.

01:21:03.348 --> 01:21:05.044
The Lupin place?

01:21:05.116 --> 01:21:06.277
Yeah.

01:21:06.351 --> 01:21:08.286
If they try
to get away,

01:21:08.353 --> 01:21:09.446
shoot them.

01:21:33.378 --> 01:21:35.142
I'm making you
a present.

01:21:35.213 --> 01:21:37.478
You can have
the good deeds.

01:21:37.549 --> 01:21:39.142
I don't want them.

01:21:39.217 --> 01:21:41.243
What good deeds?

01:21:41.319 --> 01:21:43.254
A good deed for Ma.

01:21:43.321 --> 01:21:45.222
Ain't that
why we're here?

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:48.158
We're here because
you got in a jam

01:21:48.226 --> 01:21:50.821
and got yourself on
a "wanted" poster.

01:21:50.895 --> 01:21:52.329
You make it personal

01:21:52.397 --> 01:21:55.333
for a man that's been
in a few scrapes himself.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.834
Tell us what happened.

01:21:56.901 --> 01:21:59.769
Some bartender got sore because
I was raffling off my eye.

01:21:59.838 --> 01:22:02.774
He started banging
away at me with a.45.

01:22:02.841 --> 01:22:05.276
Well, that makes it
self-defense.

01:22:05.343 --> 01:22:08.108
Why didn't you stand trial
and clear yourself?

01:22:08.179 --> 01:22:10.546
Because it's his town
and I'm an outsider.

01:22:10.615 --> 01:22:12.777
<i>Let me have
that rope.</i>

01:22:12.851 --> 01:22:14.581
Look.

01:22:14.652 --> 01:22:16.086
<i>Drag them out.</i>

01:22:16.154 --> 01:22:17.782
<i>We ought to hang them.</i>

01:22:17.856 --> 01:22:21.554
<i>Yeah, get a rope
and hang them up.</i>

01:22:21.626 --> 01:22:23.891
<i>Let's drag them out.</i>

01:22:23.962 --> 01:22:27.558
<i>Yeah, drag them out
and hang them.</i>

01:22:28.867 --> 01:22:30.301
<i>Let's drag them out.</i>

01:22:30.368 --> 01:22:32.234
<i>Let's hang them.</i>

01:22:49.187 --> 01:22:50.382
How's Billy?

01:22:50.455 --> 01:22:51.787
I don't know.

01:22:54.392 --> 01:22:56.827
You think
we did it, too.

01:22:56.895 --> 01:22:59.262
I don't know
what to think.

01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:02.596
If only you'd gone away
right after the funeral.

01:23:09.807 --> 01:23:13.266
<i>Let's go get them!
What do you say?</i>

01:23:13.344 --> 01:23:15.006
Whiskey.

01:23:15.079 --> 01:23:16.274
Hey.

01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:21.278
Seems like everybody
in this town's

01:23:21.352 --> 01:23:23.184
made up their mind.

01:23:23.254 --> 01:23:25.780
Go on home, Mary,
and stay home.

01:23:25.857 --> 01:23:28.622
I don't want you
around here.

01:23:28.693 --> 01:23:30.457
Billy's dead.

01:23:32.297 --> 01:23:33.424
Go on.

01:23:33.498 --> 01:23:35.524
Did he...

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.466
Did he say
who shot him?

01:23:37.535 --> 01:23:40.972
He never opened his mouth
to say you didn't.

01:23:44.576 --> 01:23:46.010
<i>Get a rope!</i>

01:23:46.077 --> 01:23:47.511
<i>Let's hang them!</i>

01:23:47.579 --> 01:23:49.104
<i>Somebody get a rope.</i>

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.614
<i>Get a rope!</i>

01:23:50.682 --> 01:23:52.708
I told you
to go home.

01:23:52.784 --> 01:23:54.150
What about that mob?

01:23:54.219 --> 01:23:55.983
They had feelings
for Billy.

01:23:56.054 --> 01:23:58.751
It wasn't Billy's way
to lynch a man.

01:23:58.823 --> 01:23:59.823
Four men.

01:23:59.824 --> 01:24:01.759
Three men and a boy.

01:24:01.826 --> 01:24:03.590
How can you be sure?

01:24:03.661 --> 01:24:04.993
Maybe
they're not guilty.

01:24:05.063 --> 01:24:06.156
They're convinced.

01:24:06.231 --> 01:24:08.496
They'd be the ones
on a jury.

01:24:08.566 --> 01:24:10.000
You arrest them.

01:24:10.068 --> 01:24:11.502
You don't judge them.

01:24:11.569 --> 01:24:13.970
Get the marshal
or get them to Laredo.

01:24:14.038 --> 01:24:16.769
Quit telling me
how to do my job.

01:24:23.348 --> 01:24:25.283
<i>Come on!
Let's get them!</i>

01:24:31.055 --> 01:24:34.890
Did you see the way
them people are looking at us?

01:24:36.361 --> 01:24:37.829
Yeah, I saw...

01:24:40.365 --> 01:24:42.300
and we're getting
out of here.

01:24:46.604 --> 01:24:50.041
You figure on
doing it different?

01:24:51.876 --> 01:24:54.641
They come to feed us
in the morning,

01:24:54.712 --> 01:24:56.146
we'll get the key.

01:25:17.333 --> 01:25:18.995
How's it look?

01:25:19.068 --> 01:25:21.765
Not good, Judge.

01:25:21.838 --> 01:25:24.103
Better set their trial
for morning.

01:25:24.173 --> 01:25:26.608
Pick a jury
out of that mob?

01:25:26.676 --> 01:25:28.611
That's not justice.
That's murder.

01:25:30.847 --> 01:25:33.908
We got enough
of those, Charlie?

01:25:33.983 --> 01:25:35.781
No, we ain't
got enough.

01:25:35.852 --> 01:25:38.788
Them guns ain't going
to stop no mob.

01:25:38.855 --> 01:25:40.790
You want
to let them in?

01:25:40.857 --> 01:25:43.292
Don't you
talk to me like that.

01:25:43.359 --> 01:25:45.794
Me and Billy
never lost a prisoner,

01:25:45.862 --> 01:25:47.296
mobs or no mobs.

01:25:47.363 --> 01:25:48.797
He broke them up

01:25:48.865 --> 01:25:50.629
and without no guns,
neither.

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.635
I seen him do it,

01:25:52.702 --> 01:25:55.262
but, then, you ain't
no Billy Wilson.

01:25:55.338 --> 01:25:57.603
He didn't mean
anything by it.

01:25:57.673 --> 01:25:59.869
Why don't he
use his head?

01:25:59.942 --> 01:26:02.571
If he was a patch
on Billy's shirt,

01:26:02.645 --> 01:26:04.910
he'd get those boys
out of town

01:26:04.981 --> 01:26:06.415
before it's too late.

01:26:06.482 --> 01:26:08.246
Take a look out there.

01:26:08.317 --> 01:26:10.752
Them's friends of yours
up until now,

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.254
but pretty soon

01:26:12.321 --> 01:26:14.950
you'll be
shooting bullets at them.

01:26:32.508 --> 01:26:33.942
We'll move them.

01:26:35.811 --> 01:26:37.746
We'll move them
to Laredo

01:26:37.813 --> 01:26:39.281
early
in the morning.

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.668
Tom, somebody's
coming.

01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:16.749
I guess they
changed their mind.

01:27:16.819 --> 01:27:19.755
Yell out to one
of them deputies.

01:27:19.822 --> 01:27:21.256
Tell them
you're sick.

01:27:25.795 --> 01:27:28.765
What's the matter with you?
Want your neck stretched?

01:27:28.831 --> 01:27:30.265
We're going
to face it.

01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:32.268
I ain't facing
no lynch mob.

01:27:32.335 --> 01:27:35.271
You ran in New Orleans.
That's why we're here.

01:27:35.338 --> 01:27:36.772
We're not running again.

01:27:36.839 --> 01:27:38.774
Katie's not
losing this one.

01:27:38.841 --> 01:27:40.776
We're the ones
in trouble.

01:27:40.843 --> 01:27:42.277
I suppose she wasn't?

01:27:42.345 --> 01:27:45.281
She tried to raise
her kids the right way.

01:27:45.348 --> 01:27:48.113
They didn't turn out
the right way.

01:27:48.184 --> 01:27:50.449
Nobody's making
any decisions for me.

01:27:50.519 --> 01:27:52.112
I'll make my own.

01:27:52.188 --> 01:27:55.124
Sure. You can buy her
an angel or a lamb,

01:27:55.191 --> 01:27:58.127
pay her off with
a slab of marble.

01:27:58.194 --> 01:28:00.060
You can make
that decision,

01:28:00.129 --> 01:28:01.893
but I'll decide
this one.

01:28:01.964 --> 01:28:03.899
If we all get killed,

01:28:03.966 --> 01:28:05.400
nobody's going to run.

01:28:05.468 --> 01:28:07.232
Katie wins this one.

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:18.473
Come on.

01:28:18.547 --> 01:28:19.981
You're going to Laredo.

01:28:20.049 --> 01:28:22.245
If you make
one wrong move,

01:28:22.318 --> 01:28:25.254
you'll get the same thing
you gave Billy.

01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:56.285
You got
the shackles ready?

01:28:56.352 --> 01:28:57.445
All ready.

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.080
All right,
you two over here.

01:29:00.156 --> 01:29:02.887
I don't want to be
shackled to him.

01:29:02.958 --> 01:29:06.725
Kind of late to be
choosy about your friends.

01:29:06.796 --> 01:29:08.230
Get a leg up.

01:29:16.205 --> 01:29:17.833
Make sure
they're tight.

01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:35.824
Raise your right hands.

01:29:35.891 --> 01:29:38.258
You swear to act
as deputy sheriffs

01:29:38.327 --> 01:29:41.092
and uphold the laws
of the state of Texas?

01:29:41.163 --> 01:29:42.597
Say, "I do."

01:29:42.665 --> 01:29:44.600
- I do.
- I do.

01:29:56.212 --> 01:29:57.612
Get in
that wagon.

01:30:30.613 --> 01:30:31.979
Hyah.

01:32:02.605 --> 01:32:05.541
Let them get on the bridge,
and they're all yours.

01:32:05.608 --> 01:32:07.600
I don't trust
them guards.

01:32:07.676 --> 01:32:09.770
The drivers
are on our side.

01:32:09.845 --> 01:32:11.780
They've got
their stories straight...

01:32:11.847 --> 01:32:13.941
"We were ambushed
by the Elder gang."

01:32:30.466 --> 01:32:31.866
Whoa.

01:32:33.902 --> 01:32:35.302
What's the matter?

01:32:35.371 --> 01:32:37.306
Why are you
stopping here?

01:32:37.373 --> 01:32:39.239
To rest the horses.

01:32:39.308 --> 01:32:41.675
Hey, Ned,
what's the matter?

01:32:41.744 --> 01:32:43.178
Resting the horses.

01:32:46.382 --> 01:32:47.577
To rest the horses!

01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:48.709
Jump!

01:33:15.242 --> 01:33:17.074
Put your hands up, Ben.

01:33:18.946 --> 01:33:20.744
You're wearing
a badge.

01:33:20.814 --> 01:33:22.282
So was Billy.

01:33:22.349 --> 01:33:23.840
Drop that rifle.

01:33:41.401 --> 01:33:43.700
One gun won't
hold them off very long.

01:33:43.770 --> 01:33:46.137
Ben's got extra guns
in that rig.

01:33:46.206 --> 01:33:47.970
Think you can
cover us?

01:33:48.041 --> 01:33:50.374
Three shots' worth.

01:33:50.444 --> 01:33:53.903
Think you can keep underwater
with me far as that rig?

01:33:53.981 --> 01:33:56.314
If I can't,
just hold me under.

01:33:56.383 --> 01:33:57.817
Then let's go.

01:34:37.591 --> 01:34:41.289
I knew you were going
to mob those boys.

01:34:41.361 --> 01:34:42.795
Inside I knew it.

01:34:42.863 --> 01:34:44.297
Sure you did, Ben,

01:34:44.364 --> 01:34:46.094
but they
had it coming.

01:35:03.817 --> 01:35:04.910
Hold it!

01:35:15.929 --> 01:35:16.988
Tom!

01:35:17.064 --> 01:35:18.064
Tom!

01:35:18.065 --> 01:35:20.000
Use the horses
to get back.

01:35:26.106 --> 01:35:27.540
Now keep in step,

01:35:27.608 --> 01:35:30.134
or we'll get tangled
and go down.

01:35:30.210 --> 01:35:31.210
Hyah!

01:35:56.703 --> 01:35:58.137
All right, Curley,

01:35:58.205 --> 01:36:00.572
this is what
you were hired for.

01:36:00.641 --> 01:36:03.577
I don't want them Elders
getting out alive.

01:36:03.644 --> 01:36:04.737
Move.

01:36:05.812 --> 01:36:07.405
All set?

01:36:07.481 --> 01:36:08.574
Yeah.

01:36:34.675 --> 01:36:37.110
They got ahold
of Ben's guns.

01:36:37.177 --> 01:36:39.772
We'll never get them
out of there.

01:36:39.846 --> 01:36:42.441
I'd like to blast them
out of there.

01:36:42.516 --> 01:36:44.951
There's dynamite here
in the gun box.

01:37:04.137 --> 01:37:06.129
I don't like it.

01:37:08.642 --> 01:37:10.235
It's too quiet.

01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:13.439
Let's get back.

01:37:13.513 --> 01:37:14.742
Cover me.

01:37:21.254 --> 01:37:22.313
Go.

01:38:07.534 --> 01:38:09.002
Look out!

01:38:41.668 --> 01:38:42.668
Matt!

01:38:45.238 --> 01:38:46.672
John...

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.174
Let me help you.

01:38:48.241 --> 01:38:49.241
No, please, I...

01:38:49.242 --> 01:38:50.676
I...

01:38:50.744 --> 01:38:52.178
John...

01:38:52.245 --> 01:38:54.111
I wish...

01:38:56.183 --> 01:38:57.617
maybe...

01:38:57.684 --> 01:39:00.119
Bud...

01:39:00.187 --> 01:39:02.622
I... I wish...

01:39:16.670 --> 01:39:17.729
Here they come!

01:40:03.416 --> 01:40:04.975
Aah!

01:40:15.896 --> 01:40:17.364
I'm hit.

01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:18.864
I'm hit!

01:40:18.932 --> 01:40:19.932
John!

01:40:40.853 --> 01:40:43.152
John Elder!
Throw me a gun!

01:40:43.222 --> 01:40:44.554
I'll help you!

01:40:44.623 --> 01:40:46.558
Ben's going to help them.

01:40:46.625 --> 01:40:47.625
Stupid fool.

01:40:47.626 --> 01:40:49.390
Hey, no, Dad.
That's Ben!

01:41:00.906 --> 01:41:02.841
Come on.

01:41:08.013 --> 01:41:09.948
Hastings is leaving.
Let's go.

01:41:10.015 --> 01:41:12.348
What will we
tell them in town?

01:41:12.418 --> 01:41:14.853
We were ambushed
by the Elder gang.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.355
Now let's go.
Let's get out of here.

01:41:31.437 --> 01:41:33.372
Hyah!

01:41:41.447 --> 01:41:44.383
Let's get out of here
before they come back.

01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:46.885
We're going back...
to town.

01:41:46.952 --> 01:41:48.386
Are you crazy?

01:41:48.454 --> 01:41:50.389
They'll kill us
the minute we get there.

01:41:50.456 --> 01:41:51.822
We ain't gonna run.

01:41:51.891 --> 01:41:52.891
I am.

01:41:52.892 --> 01:41:54.827
How are you
going to do it?

01:41:54.894 --> 01:41:57.329
There's one wagon,
and Bud needs a doctor.

01:41:57.396 --> 01:41:58.830
I'm taking him back.

01:41:58.898 --> 01:42:00.833
I'll get the buckboard.

01:42:25.457 --> 01:42:26.755
Hyah!

01:42:28.928 --> 01:42:30.362
Hyah!

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:32.454
Hyah!

01:42:34.433 --> 01:42:36.368
Hyah!

01:42:36.435 --> 01:42:38.370
Hyah!

01:42:38.437 --> 01:42:39.530
Whoa.

01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.875
Get Bud in the barn.

01:42:53.385 --> 01:42:54.978
Hold it, Bert.

01:43:00.459 --> 01:43:03.019
Go on home.
Get out of here.

01:43:04.897 --> 01:43:06.331
Wait a minute, kid.

01:43:06.398 --> 01:43:08.833
We're going to
need a doctor.

01:43:08.901 --> 01:43:10.927
Go get Doc Isdell.

01:43:12.404 --> 01:43:13.838
Go on, Jeb.

01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:19.936
Be quick about it.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.840
Take off
these leg irons.

01:43:23.916 --> 01:43:25.316
Theirs first.

01:43:25.384 --> 01:43:26.384
Yes, sir.

01:43:26.385 --> 01:43:28.320
Where are you going, son?

01:43:28.387 --> 01:43:30.185
Doc Isdell's.
One of them's hurt.

01:43:30.256 --> 01:43:31.519
What's your hurry?

01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:32.853
My pa's in there.

01:43:32.925 --> 01:43:34.689
Let the boy go.

01:44:06.759 --> 01:44:08.193
That's it, Harry.

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.820
That's far enough.

01:44:10.896 --> 01:44:12.694
What do you want?

01:44:12.765 --> 01:44:15.701
First off,
I want you to surrender.

01:44:15.768 --> 01:44:17.794
Then I'll let
the doctor through.

01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:19.304
We get the doctor,

01:44:19.371 --> 01:44:21.340
or you're going to
come up short a blacksmith.

01:44:21.407 --> 01:44:22.841
Do what he says,
Harry!

01:44:22.908 --> 01:44:24.843
Not till we see you
out here first!

01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:25.910
Harry!

01:44:25.911 --> 01:44:27.345
We can't trust him,
Will.

01:44:27.413 --> 01:44:31.544
We can trust your deputies
to shoot us up.

01:44:31.617 --> 01:44:35.315
Your gang killed a lot of
good men doing their job.

01:44:35.387 --> 01:44:36.855
My gang?

01:44:36.922 --> 01:44:39.858
Then who killed Matt,
shot Bud,

01:44:39.925 --> 01:44:41.951
and blew up the bridge?

01:44:42.027 --> 01:44:44.622
Well, what about Billy?

01:44:44.697 --> 01:44:46.859
How long does it
take a man

01:44:46.932 --> 01:44:48.457
to ride to Pecos, Harry?

01:44:48.534 --> 01:44:51.299
8, 9 hours.

01:44:51.370 --> 01:44:53.339
When did you
last see Billy?

01:44:53.405 --> 01:44:56.273
We were playing chess
at 9:00.

01:44:56.342 --> 01:44:59.574
We can prove
we were in Pecos at 9:00.

01:45:02.014 --> 01:45:03.949
Send for the marshal,
Harry.

01:45:04.016 --> 01:45:05.450
We'll give ourselves up,

01:45:05.517 --> 01:45:08.316
but not to you
or anyone in this town.

01:45:08.387 --> 01:45:11.323
But you get that U.S. marshal
from Laredo,

01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:12.688
and we'll come out.

01:45:12.758 --> 01:45:15.557
How am I going to get
a U.S. marshal here?

01:45:15.627 --> 01:45:17.061
I don't know.

01:45:17.129 --> 01:45:19.826
Telegraph him
or go get him yourself,

01:45:19.898 --> 01:45:21.264
but get him.

01:45:29.608 --> 01:45:31.167
Go on in, Doc.

01:45:41.954 --> 01:45:43.923
Over here.

01:45:46.925 --> 01:45:48.450
All right, out.

01:45:57.736 --> 01:45:59.898
What happened?
What happened?

01:46:16.655 --> 01:46:18.317
One of them's wounded,
the kid.

01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:20.825
I want you men
to break it up.

01:46:20.893 --> 01:46:22.327
Those men
are my prisoners

01:46:22.394 --> 01:46:25.831
the same as
if they were in that jail.

01:46:25.898 --> 01:46:28.333
The U.S. marshal
from Laredo will be here,

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:31.336
and any man starting trouble
will answer to him.

01:46:31.403 --> 01:46:33.838
Break it up and go home!

01:46:33.906 --> 01:46:35.340
Come on, son.

01:46:35.407 --> 01:46:36.407
Go on!

01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:57.794
I've done about
all I can for him now.

01:46:57.863 --> 01:47:00.799
You'd best get him over
to the boardinghouse

01:47:00.866 --> 01:47:02.801
as soon as you can.

01:47:32.898 --> 01:47:34.833
John...

01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:35.900
Yeah?

01:47:35.901 --> 01:47:37.335
Don't worry about him.

01:47:37.402 --> 01:47:38.836
He'll pull through.

01:47:38.904 --> 01:47:41.840
We'll see
he gets raised right...

01:47:41.907 --> 01:47:43.500
you and me.

01:48:06.131 --> 01:48:08.362
What if the marshal
gets here first?

01:48:08.433 --> 01:48:09.867
It's their word
against ours.

01:48:09.935 --> 01:48:11.870
Who'll take
a gunfighter's word

01:48:11.937 --> 01:48:13.371
against a
respected businessman's?

01:48:13.438 --> 01:48:16.374
What if one of those guards
breaks, Pa?

01:48:16.441 --> 01:48:17.875
Huh?

01:48:17.943 --> 01:48:19.878
Only a weakling breaks.

01:48:19.945 --> 01:48:21.880
They won't talk.

01:48:29.454 --> 01:48:31.389
Not in here,
you idiot.

01:48:31.456 --> 01:48:33.891
You want to
blow us all up?

01:48:33.959 --> 01:48:36.394
Curley smoked in here.

01:48:39.965 --> 01:48:41.900
You ain't Curley.

01:49:20.204 --> 01:49:21.536
John.

01:49:24.942 --> 01:49:28.379
Dave... he never did answer
any questions for us.

01:49:28.445 --> 01:49:30.880
We got all the answers
we'll ever get.

01:49:30.948 --> 01:49:32.883
Yeah, but it's
worth a try.

01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:34.384
You're not going.

01:49:34.451 --> 01:49:37.387
You step one foot
outside that door,

01:49:37.454 --> 01:49:39.389
and you're dead.

01:49:39.456 --> 01:49:41.391
You're not going.

01:50:25.936 --> 01:50:28.872
Did, uh, Doc Isdell
say anything

01:50:28.939 --> 01:50:30.373
about changing the...

01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:56.189
You make one move,
and you're dead.

01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:58.320
Do as I say.

01:51:58.395 --> 01:52:00.330
Back.

01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:49.876
Move.

01:52:49.945 --> 01:52:51.345
Move.

01:53:20.509 --> 01:53:23.843
All right.
There's one left for you.

01:53:23.913 --> 01:53:25.347
Now move.

01:53:25.414 --> 01:53:27.076
Move.

01:54:05.988 --> 01:54:07.923
Here's a present
for you.

01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:09.618
Now get your answers.

01:54:10.993 --> 01:54:14.828
I'm going to give you
some real good advice, mister.

01:54:14.897 --> 01:54:18.095
This is no time
for lying.

01:54:18.167 --> 01:54:19.601
Who ambushed us?

01:54:19.668 --> 01:54:20.829
I don't know.

01:54:21.604 --> 01:54:22.604
Aah!

01:54:22.605 --> 01:54:23.834
Aah!

01:54:23.906 --> 01:54:26.341
Answer me!
Who killed my brother?

01:54:26.408 --> 01:54:27.842
I don't know!

01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:30.505
Talk! You were there
when Ben got it.

01:54:30.579 --> 01:54:32.445
Who ambushed us?
Who murdered Matt?

01:54:32.514 --> 01:54:34.540
I don't know!
I didn't do anything!

01:54:34.617 --> 01:54:35.846
I didn't...

01:54:35.918 --> 01:54:36.918
Aah!

01:54:36.919 --> 01:54:38.854
When I let you
breathe again,

01:54:38.921 --> 01:54:41.550
you better come up
with the right answers.

01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:49.364
Pa!

01:54:49.431 --> 01:54:51.366
I didn't tell them.

01:54:51.433 --> 01:54:53.299
I wasn't
going to talk.

01:54:53.369 --> 01:54:56.505
I wasn't
going to talk.

01:54:56.838 --> 01:54:58.306
Drop that gun,
Hastings.

01:54:59.875 --> 01:55:01.309
B-But they shot at me.

01:55:01.376 --> 01:55:02.810
They got Dave
in there.

01:55:02.878 --> 01:55:04.312
Get him out.

01:55:10.619 --> 01:55:12.053
I didn't tell them.

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.055
Didn't tell them
what, Dave?

01:55:14.122 --> 01:55:15.818
My father...

01:55:15.891 --> 01:55:17.325
he killed Ben.

01:55:17.392 --> 01:55:18.826
He killed him.

01:55:18.894 --> 01:55:20.829
And my dad?

01:55:20.896 --> 01:55:22.831
Your father...

01:55:22.898 --> 01:55:25.834
found out
he was being cheated.

01:55:25.901 --> 01:55:27.836
And Billy...

01:55:27.903 --> 01:55:30.338
kept getting
closer to the truth.

01:55:30.405 --> 01:55:31.839
Billy, too?

01:55:41.917 --> 01:55:43.852
John.

01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:47.355
Give me that gun.

01:55:47.422 --> 01:55:50.358
I represent the law
around here now.

01:55:50.425 --> 01:55:52.189
We'll take care
of Hastings.

01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:55.196
I don't want any trouble
with you, Harry.

01:55:55.263 --> 01:55:57.289
I wouldn't argue with him.

01:56:42.911 --> 01:56:45.346
John.

01:56:45.413 --> 01:56:48.850
This is something
I have to do myself, Harry.

01:56:50.418 --> 01:56:52.444
Get Doc Isdell
for Tom.

02:00:17.926 --> 02:00:19.360
John.

02:00:27.569 --> 02:00:29.367
Bud's in here.

02:00:29.437 --> 02:00:30.871
Is he all right?

02:00:30.939 --> 02:00:33.374
Doc says he'll need
lots of care.

02:00:33.441 --> 02:00:34.875
He'll get it.

02:00:34.943 --> 02:00:35.943
And Tom?

02:00:35.944 --> 02:00:37.378
Doc's with him now.

02:00:37.445 --> 02:00:38.879
Tom said it'd take

02:00:38.947 --> 02:00:41.382
more than one bullet
to kill him.

02:00:47.856 --> 02:00:49.381
He's in here.
