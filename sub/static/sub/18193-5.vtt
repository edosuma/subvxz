00:04.840 --> 00:06.034
Shit!

00:12.560 --> 00:14.471
No. Jen? Jen?

00:14.560 --> 00:16.357
Oh. You.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.430
And a top of the morning to you, you whore.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.238
Tea.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.435
I hope you haven't used up
all the hot water.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.513
Ah.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.556
Right.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.553
Ramona!

01:21.520 --> 01:23.875
Sorry.
- Yes?

01:23.960 --> 01:25.393
Hi. I'm Nick.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.471
Yeah?
- David's brother.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.949
David who lives here?
- Unless there's another?

01:30.040 --> 01:33.794
No, it's just I didn't know he had a
brother. - He talks about me a lot, does he?

01:33.880 --> 01:36.838
As much as the rest of his family.
- That sounds like David.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.510
So, can I come in?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.830
Well, there's nobody here at the moment.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.990
You are.
- Yes, but I'm leaving.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.672
Fair enough.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.470
It's the risk of arriving unannounced.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.714
I'll wait in a bus shelter
until they get back from work.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.836
No. No. I'll ring him.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.876
Good idea.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.948
You don't know his office number, do you?

02:03.040 --> 02:05.395
I'll phone Karen.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.155
Jen, it would easier to talk this through
if he was still living here.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.151
Not interested. I'd rather eat dog dirt.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.117
He's stopped seeing her.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.236
They work together.
- Yeah, but...

02:15.320 --> 02:17.595
Forget it, Adam, please. Just forget it.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.149
Oi! Oi! Where are you going with that?

02:22.280 --> 02:23.952
Adam's.
- No, you're not.

02:24.040 --> 02:27.157
What, you mean I can stay?
- I mean you're not taking that suitcase.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.196
We bought it together. My half stays here.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.155
What am I supposed to cart
my gear around in?

02:32.240 --> 02:34.629
Plastic bags are under the sink.
You can have five.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.750
Are you not maybe being
a wee bit hard on him?

02:43.480 --> 02:45.710
Do you think so?
- Yes.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.439
All right.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.431
You can have six.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.318
Nick. What are you doing in Manchester?

02:53.400 --> 02:55.516
Just passing through, you know.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.828
Yeah, yeah. I know.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.850
Thought I'd pop by and say hi,

02:59.428 --> 03:01.675
but I'm having a problem with your
welcoming committee.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.355
Rachel? - Is that her name?
She didn't want to tell me.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.670
Seems to think I might be
a bit of a con man.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.155
Yeah, well, she's always been
what you might call perceptive.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.117
What do I think of her?

03:15.360 --> 03:18.238
She seems very nice. Attractive.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.790
A bit prickly,
but I'm sure that's just on the surface.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.598
Is she seeing anyone?

03:23.680 --> 03:24.715
Nick.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.233
Really?

03:26.320 --> 03:28.880
Nicholas, let me talk to her.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.636
She wants to talk to you now.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.189
I don't believe you told him
I'm not seeing anyone.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.236
Rachel, I didn't.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.726
Listen, can you lend him your keys
and tell him to make himself at home?

03:44.876 --> 03:46.394
I'm late for a meeting.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.948
Yeah, I will do. I'll see you tonight. Bye.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.310
Well, you passed. Come in.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.435
Shall I dump my stuff in the spare room?

03:59.520 --> 04:01.158
I'm staying in the spare room.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.037
I figured you were...

04:04.520 --> 04:05.509
...Rachel.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.956
Right, well er... Come in.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.876
Make yourself at home.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.351
See you later.
- I hope so.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.112
Bye.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.753
Great, then, Jen.
So that's your marriage over, huh?

04:23.840 --> 04:27.037
Listen, I gave him a chance
and he didn't stop seeing her.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.510
He didn't know you were giving him a chance.
I gave him the ultimatum.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.195
It was me he gave his word to. In a sense
you could argue it was me he betrayed.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.033
I could've put that better.
Just don't kick him out.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.829
For no other reason than I don't want
to live with him when he's miserable.

04:41.359 --> 04:42.636
He eats all my food.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.278
My heart bleeds.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.598
Right, I'll be off, then.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.591
Got everything?

04:53.680 --> 04:55.875
Have you got a picture of your own son?
You got that?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.116
Ah. No.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.475
God help whoever has to look after you now.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.793
Please, Jen.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.994
There you go. You can have that one.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.236
It's an old one. We're smiling.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.236
Well, I would ask you to stay.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.278
But there again... See you.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.713
Bye.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.472
See...

05:44.560 --> 05:46.516
See you.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.556
See you.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.599
Nicholas?

06:03.760 --> 06:06.832
What does he want?
- David, why does he have to want anything?

06:06.920 --> 06:08.990
He just thought it would be nice to see us.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.789
Oh, yeah. So where is he, then?
- He's at the pub with Rachel.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.707
That's his idea of seeing us, is it?

06:15.018 --> 06:17.032
You were at the office.
You'll see him at dinner.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.750
So he's invited himself to dinner?
- I invited him for dinner. And to stay.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.070
And he wants to stay?

06:26.200 --> 06:28.555
It must be some favour he's after.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.717
I didn't know you had a brother.
- Oh, we're not close.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.392
He lives in Kent.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.630
Which is close enough for my liking.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.632
Younger or older?
- Younger. About eight years.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.315
Oh, was he an accident?
- Yeah. More of a mistake, really.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.118
Oh, I see.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.076
What?
- Why you're not close.

06:49.120 --> 06:53.671
For eight years you were the apple of your
parents' eye. The centre of their world.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.558
Then one day you woke up
and found that the earth had shifted.

06:56.640 --> 07:01.395
You'd been pushed to the edge, your position
usurped by this mewling, puking cuckoo.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.477
You've read the Ladybird book of psychology,
have you?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.237
It's great being me.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.709
No. The reason he irritates me
has nothing to do with our parents.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.713
He's inconsiderate, irresponsible.
People seem to find it charming.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.439
Well...rogues are lovable.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.347
Take last night, for instance.

07:22.829 --> 07:25.548
Karen cooks a meal especially,
says it's going to be ready at 8:00.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.269
Where is he at 8:15? Still down the pub.
- I like the sound of this guy.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.830
He and Rachel finally stagger in at 8:20.
- Oh! Wait! What?

07:32.920 --> 07:36.549
Er...Rachel?
- The vegetables were ruined, almost pureed.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.393
Him and Rachel went to the pub?
- I expect she paid.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.756
She wouldn't take kindly to that.
- Nick has a way with women.

07:42.840 --> 07:46.674
I don't like the sound of this guy.
- 20 minutes late. That's just rude.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.036
Didn't Karen mind?
- That's the most infuriating thing.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.753
Sorry.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.512
Are you expecting someone? Are you?

08:04.240 --> 08:05.832
Is it a hot date?

08:14.080 --> 08:16.355
You know I said
I never wanted to see you again?

08:16.440 --> 08:18.351
I brought you these.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.872
I don't like chrysanthemums.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.796
Can I see my son, please?

08:29.400 --> 08:31.755
How's he been?
- Off his food.

08:32.799 --> 08:36.839
Don't you think he senses something?
- No. I bought him Mr Men yoghurts.

08:36.919 --> 08:40.434
Oh, Jen.
You know he likes Thomas the Tank Engine.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.192
Hello, tiger. Hello.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.230
Hello. Are you being a good boy for Mummy?

08:50.320 --> 08:52.231
I thought you'd be at work.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.790
That's why I've come round.
To tell you I've quit my job.

08:55.880 --> 08:56.995
You what?

08:58.280 --> 09:00.430
Well...so I never have to see Amy again.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.636
I thought that's what you wanted.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.519
How will we pay the bloody mortgage?
- We'll manage. We'll make cutbacks.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.556
We'll make cutbacks?

09:13.680 --> 09:16.717
Do you want him to do a paper round?
Pay for his own yoghurt?

09:16.800 --> 09:20.270
I don't understand.
Why didn't...why didn't you get a job first?

09:20.360 --> 09:22.237
Yeah, well...

09:23.160 --> 09:26.232
That might take some time.
- Well...precisely!

09:27.760 --> 09:29.716
I thought you'd be pleased.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.476
I'm sorry. You're a prat.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.110
This does not make everything all right.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.031
It makes it worse, Pete.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.316
What am I going to do?

09:47.160 --> 09:50.277
Oh, God.
- It can't hurt that much.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.909
How would you know? - I got hit
in the balls a lot when I was young.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.879
Well, that's a pubic school education
for you.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.349
Oh, God. Ohh. Help me to the changing rooms.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.034
What about our game?
- I can't play squash.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.157
Course you can. Little tap in the gonads.
Here, hit this.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.276
There you are. Right as rain.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.271
I can hardly stand!

10:11.000 --> 10:13.309
All right, I'll give you three points
a game.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.960
All right. Five. And you can serve.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.071
Come on. We've got the court for an hour.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.754
I can't play with myself...as it were.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.233
I don't know what to do.
I could ask for my job back.

10:32.320 --> 10:36.154
But I'd have to take a pay cut. Then
there's the problem of having Amy around.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.196
I don't care, but Jen would.

10:38.280 --> 10:42.159
I mean, what do you reckon?
- I reckon those two women are eyeing us up.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.471
'Ey? - OK, be subtle about this.
Over by the jukebox.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.988
What, them two? - Subtle, subtle!
Jesus, you're out of practice.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.150
Look, I'm not chatting birds up, mate.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.429
You might be happy with present company.
I could do with a change.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.830
I'm trying to patch things up with my wife.
- Not very successfully.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.799
You don't have to do the chatting up.
Just non-interference and I'll do it.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.359
Come on.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.278
He's coming over.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.155
Er, were you about to use this?

11:18.240 --> 11:20.196
No, we've already picked ours.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.236
Oh, yeah? What have you chosen?

11:25.400 --> 11:27.356
I'm Adam.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.078
This is er...

11:31.320 --> 11:32.833
...Pete.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.309
Hi.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.113
<i>And then...</i>

11:39.200 --> 11:41.953
<i>And then David writes this long letter home,</i>

11:42.040 --> 11:46.192
saying, ''I've found the tuck shop. I'm in
the cricket team.'' All the usual stuff.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.032
And signs it, ''From your loving son.''

11:48.120 --> 11:50.156
There's a little PS at the bottom that says,

11:50.240 --> 11:53.550
''Mummy, Daddy, come and get me.
There's buggery at this school.''

11:54.880 --> 11:57.235
I don't see what's funny. It was traumatic.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.596
Didn't they come and get you?
- No, they increased my allowance.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.035
Perhaps they expected to pay
the buggers off.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.396
I hated that school.
You were lucky you didn't have to go there.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.711
Mum and Dad couldn't afford it.
David got all the privileges.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.756
While you got away with murder.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.955
This is going very, very well.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.349
Oh, no, we don't want that on!

12:23.440 --> 12:25.078
I do.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.353
What have them two
gone to the toilet together for?

12:29.440 --> 12:32.671
I don't know. Checking on condoms, probably.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.954
What?

12:34.040 --> 12:36.429
A couple of top-flight birds we've pulled.

12:36.520 --> 12:40.274
Well...Sally or whatever her name
won't be needing any.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.316
Oh, no. Safe sex, big fella!

12:43.040 --> 12:46.396
Come on, I'm joking. I appreciate this.
- Cheers. Thanks a lot.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.436
We were just admiring your bathroom.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.071
Did you do the tiling yourself?

12:53.160 --> 12:54.878
Oh, yeah.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.916
Would you like to see it?

12:59.800 --> 13:01.438
Again.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.631
Argh! God.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.472
Sorry. Was that a bit too hard?

13:21.560 --> 13:24.677
No er...I'm a little um...er...sensitive.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.630
About women touching you?
- No.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.431
Sorry, I, um...

13:38.520 --> 13:40.476
I'm a bit sore. I hurt myself today.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.394
Oh, yeah? What were you doing? - Playing
squash, but I got hit in the goolies.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.198
Let's have a look.
- No!

13:46.280 --> 13:48.874
Adam, it's a bit late to be shy now.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.791
Oh, my God. It's black!

13:51.880 --> 13:54.713
You're right.
It shouldn't be that colour, should it?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.756
Not unless the rest of you is.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.636
It's a funny shape, as well.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.432
Mm. It's a bit swollen.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.431
Do you check yourself?

14:05.520 --> 14:09.195
How do you mean?
- For lumps. My boyfriend always does.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.312
You've got a boyfriend?
- Oh, he's in the army. He's away.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.311
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.473
Don't worry, I'm not coming anywhere near
that thing. You want to get it seen to.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.556
It's bruised, isn't it?

14:36.960 --> 14:40.748
It is. But that's not primarily
what concerns me.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.193
It isn't?

14:43.120 --> 14:46.271
Had you felt any discomfort
prior to your sports injury?

14:47.040 --> 14:49.508
Er, no. No. Not really. No.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.556
You can get dressed now.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.877
<i>I'm referring you to the hospital
for an ultrasound.</i>

14:59.960 --> 15:02.235
Hospital?
- You have a swelling.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.793
I'm not surprised.
I had a squash ball in the nuts.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.516
I think the swelling predates that.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.511
I'm not sure, Adam,

15:14.600 --> 15:16.556
but I think you may have a tumour.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.796
<i>Do you want a taxi?</i>

16:00.480 --> 16:02.436
Do you want a taxi, pal?

16:02.520 --> 16:04.351
Taxi?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.556
Where to, son?

16:19.200 --> 16:21.634
Er, um... Oh, home.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.508
Unless you mean my home, you'll have to
give me more of a clue than that.

16:26.680 --> 16:27.999
What?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.797
Er, Manyon Street, Didsbury.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.999
Just visiting?
- No, I live there.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.559
No, I mean the hospital.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.231
No, I went for a checkup.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.276
I thought it was summat like that.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.229
People often look a bit distracted
when they come away from there.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.833
Everything all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.318
No, not fine.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.036
They say I've got cancer.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.478
So...David's brother.

17:23.560 --> 17:28.111
I don't know...
But is he anything like David, Rachel?

17:28.200 --> 17:31.909
In what way? - You know,
Financial Times shoved up his arse.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.389
Oh, my God, no! He's completely different.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.552
For a start, he's eight years younger.
- He's an accident, then?

17:37.640 --> 17:39.312
He votes Labour.
- Bloody hell.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.470
He's always voted Labour.
- Bloody hell.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.439
And he likes Massive Attack,
Irvine Welsh and backpacking.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.158
He's adopted, then.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.878
Last night we went to the theatre.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.109
You whore!

17:53.160 --> 17:54.479
Stop it!

17:55.840 --> 17:59.071
Suck me. Suck it!

18:06.880 --> 18:09.075
Not really David's taste.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.957
No songs.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.229
God, it was brilliant.
I don't think I drew breath for two hours.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.995
Weren't you meant to see Adam last night?
- Only for a film. It's still on next week.

18:19.080 --> 18:23.392
Anyway, we came out of the theatre
and we came down this canal,

18:23.480 --> 18:25.436
and we stood over there.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.150
I wish I'd visited my brother more often.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.670
Timing might not have been right, then.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.559
Is it now?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.313
Our first kiss.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.356
Under that lamppost.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.390
The one with all the dog shit?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.871
I don't think that was there this morning.

19:02.760 --> 19:06.070
Mind you, I don't think
we'd have noticed even if it was.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.191
Oh, Jen, I'm so sorry.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.919
I'm going on and on about myself, and...

19:13.080 --> 19:14.718
What about you?

19:14.800 --> 19:16.756
How are things?

19:17.720 --> 19:20.553
What, you mean my failed marriage? Fine.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.948
Actually, I'm thinking of getting a divorce.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.674
No.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.236
Because Pete had a fling?

19:33.600 --> 19:35.830
No. That were just a symptom.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.875
I think he was unhappy.
I think I was unhappy, actually.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.272
You know...we didn't plan on this.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.396
I planned on getting old with him.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.630
Stair master. Walk-in bath. The lot.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.393
I were looking forward to
curvature of the spine.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.998
We were going to be a really good adventure,
him and me.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.278
I just...

20:03.360 --> 20:06.079
I just can't picture it in my mind any more.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.916
Anyway...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.468
Nothing's permanent. It's all right. And...

20:13.880 --> 20:16.394
And I've just got to move on. It's fine.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.118
Are you sure it's cancer?
- Me? I haven't got a clue.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.193
But they gave me this ultrasound thing,
you know.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.589
I don't know. It shows the echo
or something.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.672
They reckon there's a 95% chance
I've got a malignant tumour.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.274
Well, there's a 5% chance that you haven't.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.079
I think they call that clutching at straws.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.391
Either way, I've got to have a bollock off.
- Bloody hell..

20:52.560 --> 20:54.232
Which one?

20:55.200 --> 20:57.839
Does it matter?
- It does if you want kids, yeah.

20:57.920 --> 21:01.959
Sons come from the right bollock -
well, that's according to my nan.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.998
Qualified, was she?
- She had 15 kids.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.517
They said if I was unhappy
about having only meat and one veg,

21:11.600 --> 21:13.556
that they could give me a new one.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.157
It wouldn't be real, though.

21:16.240 --> 21:20.711
A rubber ball?
- No. Silicone. Like a breast implant.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.792
Except smaller.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.752
I said no.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.956
If I'm going to be flying somewhere,
I want to be worried about crashing,

21:32.040 --> 21:33.996
not if my nuts are gonna explode.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.275
That's if I get to fly anywhere again.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.998
Are you er...

21:42.480 --> 21:44.277
Are you worried about dying?

22:01.960 --> 22:04.713
God, almighty.
We must have been talking a while.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.591
Call it 50 pounds, yeah? - Put your
money away, son. This one's on me.

22:08.680 --> 22:12.150
But your time. You could have been working.
- Forget about it.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.156
All right, then. Have a drink, yeah?

22:17.320 --> 22:19.276
OK. I'll drink to your health.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.591
Are you still determined
not to tell your mates about it?

22:23.680 --> 22:26.353
I don't know
if I could cope with their sympathy.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.353
Anyway, all the best, Adam. Goodluck, son.
- Thanks, Phil.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.396
Oi, oi! I'll have his cab!

22:35.440 --> 22:37.670
Harper Lane, mate.
- What's happened?

22:37.760 --> 22:39.716
Jenny. She wants a divorce.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.590
Oi, and put the meter on.
I know what crooks you cabbies are.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.557
Go on. Chop, chop.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.713
Hi.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.836
Is Karen around?

23:04.920 --> 23:06.876
No. She's giving Josh his bath.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.996
<i>Is that whisky you're drinking?</i>

23:15.480 --> 23:17.436
Help yourself, if you want one.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.158
No, no, no.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.352
All right, then.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.436
I was wondering if I could have a word?

23:34.680 --> 23:37.638
Four days. I wondered how long it
would take.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.317
I need to borrow some money.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.198
Oh. Why don't you ask Father?

23:46.080 --> 23:47.877
It's to pay him back.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.229
Oi. Oi. What's all this?

23:58.960 --> 24:01.269
The rest of your stuff.
- Can I borrow this?

24:01.360 --> 24:04.830
I'm not taking it. - All right,
I'll leave it out for the bin men.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.992
No, you will not!
- Er...yeah! I will.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.674
Er, could you two er...calm down a wee bit?

24:10.760 --> 24:13.035
I'm perfectly calm.
- Yes. Me, too.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.396
Right. I want everything of yours
out of this house, right?

24:17.120 --> 24:19.475
What about the rest of the stuff?
- It's ours.

24:19.560 --> 24:23.314
Well, I want half! - Fine. Get a lawyer.
You'll get it in the divorce.

24:23.400 --> 24:27.678
You're not getting a divorce.
- Look. Well, if I'm taking this stuff.

24:27.760 --> 24:31.230
Yeah. I'll take this, too!
- We got that on holiday.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.833
I bought it!
- It's heinous!

24:32.920 --> 24:34.956
That's not the point.
- It's the principle.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.316
For God's sake, will you look at yourselves?
- She started it.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.389
You had an affair.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.074
You wanted to have an affair
with my best friend.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.720
Will you stop it?
- And you said you didn't love me.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.837
And I suppose you shagging Amy
makes you lovable, does it?

24:49.920 --> 24:52.753
Please. Stop it.
- I'll shag her again if it makes you happy!

24:52.840 --> 24:55.593
For God's sake, I can't take
any more of this! Stop it!

24:55.680 --> 24:59.070
I loved that fish.
- You have no idea what problems are!

24:59.160 --> 25:02.869
Oh, and I suppose you have?
''Which girl am I gonna shag tonight?''

25:02.960 --> 25:05.633
I've got cancer.
- Good one.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.996
What?
- Yeah, that shut you up, didn't it?

25:09.080 --> 25:10.638
No, I do.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.358
About 95% sure.

25:14.280 --> 25:18.193
I was not going to tell you.
Do not tell anyone else.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.236
I'm telling you because...

25:21.600 --> 25:24.672
you have a relationship, and a home,

25:24.760 --> 25:27.194
and...your Adam.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.236
Don't chuck all that away.

25:31.680 --> 25:32.999
Cancer?

25:33.960 --> 25:35.791
What kind of cancer, Adam?

25:37.840 --> 25:40.798
That was one of the reasons
I wasn't going to tell you.

25:41.560 --> 25:42.959
5,000 pounds!

25:43.840 --> 25:46.274
He asked them for 5,000 pounds
and they just gave it to him.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.316
Just like that.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.631
They wouldn't give me 5,000 pounds.
- You don't need it, do you?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.036
Nick's always been spoilt, you know.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.076
Always had whatever he wanted.

25:57.160 --> 25:59.116
A new bike. Second-hand car.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.316
Whereas I had to work for things.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.156
I did a paper round when I was 11.

26:06.760 --> 26:10.036
I can't imagine you cycling round
delivering newspapers.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.031
I didn't. My mother gave me a lift.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.478
The roads are really dangerous.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.438
The point is,
I never had anything just handed to me.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.196
My father made it plain I never would.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.516
<i>I still remember his speech
before my mother took me to school.</i>

26:28.600 --> 26:31.990
<i>David, it's time for you to leave
the family home and set off to school.</i>

26:32.080 --> 26:34.355
Marvellous opportunity, so make
the best of it.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.396
Well... Good luck.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.112
<i>He shook your hand?</i>

26:40.200 --> 26:43.293
<i>It was the closest he came to
physical intimacy, with me at any rate.</i>

26:44.481 --> 26:45.877
<i>He always hugged Nick.</i>

26:45.960 --> 26:49.953
Which is why it's so unfair!
I mean, what has Nick ever done? Hm?

26:51.440 --> 26:54.273
Whereas I...
Well, I've made something of myself.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.956
A management consultant.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.996
A top management consultant.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.569
5,000 pounds blown on
some Internet company.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.869
I thought Internet
companies did rather well.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.714
Not this one. It's gone belly-up,
taking my parents' money with it.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.792
And now he wants me to bail him out
so they need never know.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.031
So what have you told him?
- I told him I'd think about it.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.036
Well, that was big of you.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.956
There's no way I'm going to help him.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.833
Let him stew on it for a couple of days.
Good night.

27:32.680 --> 27:37.435
Right. I shall be making an incision
about four inches long in your groin,

27:37.520 --> 27:40.478
<i>then removing the testicle
and the spermatic cords.</i>

27:41.280 --> 27:46.877
<i>You'll be under general anaesthetic, which
should start to kick in...any time now.</i>

27:52.640 --> 27:53.868
Rachel!

27:55.120 --> 27:56.314
Rachel!

27:58.280 --> 27:59.508
<i>Rachel.</i>

28:00.560 --> 28:02.516
Rachel.
- Adam!

28:04.240 --> 28:06.435
Rachel. Look, I don't have much time.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.034
You're wearing underpants.
- I know. Now, listen.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.190
Why are you wearing underpants?

28:11.280 --> 28:13.350
Well, because if I wasn't I'd be naked.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.238
Do they look lopsided?
- Are you dressing to the left?

28:16.320 --> 28:18.880
That's not important now.
Look, this is important.

28:18.960 --> 28:23.238
I've almost left it too late to tell you,
but you are the love of my life.

28:23.320 --> 28:27.359
I've never loved a woman like I loved you.
Like I love you.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.111
Oh, my God.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.434
Adam! Argh!

28:37.520 --> 28:39.556
Adam, get out of the way!

28:39.640 --> 28:41.073
Mama. Mama.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.997
Ah. You've come round.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.036
That seemed to go off very well.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.792
It was a success?

29:01.880 --> 29:06.192
Too early to say, I'm afraid,
until we have the results back from the lab.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.956
Should he be here?

29:17.800 --> 29:22.396
Not unless he's done
six years' medical training, no.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.311
I'm hallucinating, right?

29:25.400 --> 29:28.870
For your sake, I certainly hope so.

29:35.880 --> 29:39.111
<i>Thanks. I'll just wait here in case
he wakes up.</i>

29:39.200 --> 29:41.794
<i>That's fine.
- Is that all right? Thank you.</i>

29:49.760 --> 29:54.151
You weren't crushed by a giant testicle,
then? - God, you made me jump.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.276
I'm hallucinating, you know.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.870
Well, I suppose that will be
the anaesthetic.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.519
What are you seeing?
- Mm.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.518
You.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.597
Really?
- Yeah.

30:11.680 --> 30:16.356
What am I doing? - You're sitting
beside my bed, talking to me.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.193
How do you know it's a hallucination
and not real life?

30:20.360 --> 30:23.238
You mean, like what's the sound
of one hand clapping?

30:25.360 --> 30:27.954
Well, Pete and Jen are
the only people I told.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.996
And I told them not to tell anyone.

30:30.080 --> 30:34.278
Quid pro quo, in the real world,
you don't know.

30:36.080 --> 30:41.279
Unless they thought that, with something so
important, they should break their promise.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.635
Tell the people closest to you.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.676
Maybe.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.196
But if that's the case,
what's that giant rabbit doing there?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.230
Collecting for medical school rag week.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.079
They told you.

31:05.440 --> 31:09.194
Oh, Rach.
You're the last person I wanted to know.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.437
Apart from David and Karen.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.873
There he is!

31:14.640 --> 31:17.200
Ha, ha.
- Hey!

31:17.280 --> 31:18.554
Sorry.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.439
Great.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.232
Adam. I've got that book
you had your eye on.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.832
Oh, right. Yeah.

31:27.920 --> 31:32.516
We found it when Pete was...
he was unpacking his stuff, actually.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.318
Weren't you?
- Mm.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.836
We're giving it a go.
- Yeah, you know. God, it's just a start.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.309
Yeah.
- Well, that's good.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.709
OK. Sure. Sure.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.950
I want a chocolate, please.

31:45.040 --> 31:48.350
Come on. Up you pop. Here you go. Open up.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.353
Can you just keep a wee bit away
from the...big fella?

31:54.440 --> 31:56.749
Come on, Josh. Off the bed. Off the bed.
- Off, Josh.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.799
How are you feeling?
- Well, you know, I'm not feeling myself.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.479
Until the scars have healed,
it's not advisable.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.309
Listen...

32:10.400 --> 32:15.076
Oh, come on. Look, you lot. I mean,
we all know what I came in here with.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.232
And what I'm leaving without.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.959
God. You don't want to be embarrassed.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.996
Because I'm half the man I used to be?

32:23.080 --> 32:27.915
Oh, Adam, don't think about it like that.
- No, it doesn't make any difference at all.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.951
Does it?

32:32.040 --> 32:34.508
It will if I need chemotherapy.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.433
There's loads of famous people
have only got the one nad.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.399
Oh, do you mean apart from Hitler?
- Well, Hitler was the most famous.

32:41.480 --> 32:47.350
Erm... But to be honest, I think, you know,
people made that up just to ridicule him.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.954
Terrific. Thanks.
- Bruce Lee only had one.

32:50.040 --> 32:53.350
What?
- I think I might have just made that up.

32:53.440 --> 32:57.479
Mind you, he led a full and active life.
There you go.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.915
Till his death at the age of 32.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.355
Yeah, but he didn't have cancer.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.396
Great. Um...

33:05.520 --> 33:09.559
God, guys.
I really appreciate you coming. Thanks.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.471
But I'd like you to go now.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.274
Yeah.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.909
Right. We'll come in tomorrow, yeah?

33:19.520 --> 33:21.715
Maybe the day after. Great.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.950
OK.
- Remember you're a Womble.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.871
Yeah.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.552
Bye, you.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.114
Bye.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.558
God.

33:46.240 --> 33:47.593
Oh, Pete!

33:47.680 --> 33:49.238
Oh, Jesus.

34:12.159 --> 34:15.436
I'll get this. - Pete, I've had
a bollock off, not a hernia.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.272
All right, then. Go on.

34:17.360 --> 34:20.670
Ohh! Er...
actually, that is a wee bit heavy, isn't it?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.355
Ah, Florence Nightingale.
- Jen. Hello.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.391
Rachel will be your nurse.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.358
Will she, now?
- Yeah. No-one else wanted to do it.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.271
Hello. How are you feeling?

34:34.360 --> 34:36.112
I'm not feeling myself.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.839
But I've done that already, haven't I?
- Yeah.

34:39.560 --> 34:43.268
I'm going to be staying for a couple
of days, if you want me around.

34:43.360 --> 34:47.034
Yeah, that's good. I need a hand
getting in and out of the bath.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.114
I'm joking.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.436
You've been changing Pete's sheets?

34:52.520 --> 34:54.431
Actually, I thought I'd burn them.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.039
Hello.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.028
Amy.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.476
I told you not to call me.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.634
Yeah. Look, we do not meet, we do not speak.

35:12.720 --> 35:16.076
In fact we...do not exist. Right?

35:19.080 --> 35:22.311
I was wondering if you'd had a chance
to think things over?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.036
Sorry. What things were those?

35:25.840 --> 35:27.478
Some other time.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.471
Oh, the loan?
- Really, it...it doesn't matter.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.476
What, you don't want a loan?
- No.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.868
No, I mean we can talk about it
some other time.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.954
Was it a loan you were after
or just a hand-out?

35:44.360 --> 35:47.033
Cos I don't think we discussed
rates of interest.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.793
You'd want interest?
- Well, didn't Father?

35:52.440 --> 35:53.509
No.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.511
No, I don't suppose he would.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.478
You see, I've got to think of the long term,
Nicholas.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.028
There's Josh's education to be
taken care of.

36:02.120 --> 36:06.352
I wouldn't be looking after him if
I didn't make the most of our investments.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.159
No...I suppose you wouldn't.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.160
I guess I could give you some interest.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.196
If it was over a long-enough period.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.952
I want to help you, Nicholas.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.035
Great.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.953
Which is why I've decided
not to lend you the money.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.836
Excuse me?

36:28.880 --> 36:31.633
It's time you stood on your own two feet,
Nicholas.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.154
That you lived up to your responsibilities.

36:34.880 --> 36:38.350
You cannot go through life
depending on others to bail you out.

36:39.400 --> 36:43.552
It will be a salutary lesson for you
to own up to Father that you let him down.

36:44.320 --> 36:46.356
And you may not thank me immediately,

36:47.400 --> 36:50.073
but in the long run
you'll see I'm doing you a favour.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.117
You insufferable shit.

36:55.680 --> 36:59.389
You pompous, patronising prick.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.630
I did say that it would be in the long run.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.636
''Teredo''? What's that?

37:09.720 --> 37:12.951
Eight points. Oh, no. Double word score.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.519
Sixteen.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.477
No. What's a ''teredo''?

37:16.560 --> 37:18.551
Ah, OK. Is it:

37:19.520 --> 37:24.355
A: A piece of music which sounds
the same when played backwards?

37:24.440 --> 37:30.231
B: A doughy bread baked by the
tribes people of Papua New Guinea?

37:32.190 --> 37:37.603
Or C: A marine mollusc that bores
into and destroys submerged timber?

37:38.040 --> 37:39.917
Or D: None of the above?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.355
Ah, well. Rachel, what is it?

37:42.440 --> 37:43.395
C.

37:43.480 --> 37:46.278
Is the correct answer, which gives you
one point,

37:46.360 --> 37:50.558
which means you're just the...
oh, 57 points behind!

37:50.640 --> 37:53.108
This is the last time I play
Scrabble with you.

37:53.200 --> 37:56.476
That's what you said the last time
that we played Scrabble.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.312
That was a while ago.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.910
The rules were different then.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.796
Our lives were different then.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.038
I know.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.278
You know, um...

38:23.360 --> 38:25.316
it wasn't that long ago that I...

38:26.440 --> 38:30.194
..wondered if maybe
we couldn't get back together.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.312
Maybe we could.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.311
What, because I've got cancer?

38:35.400 --> 38:36.958
No.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.350
I think we missed our moment.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.838
Timing, eh?

38:49.560 --> 38:51.118
Yeah.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.278
Well.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.794
We didn't remove your testicle needlessly.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.832
That's good news.
- Because the tumour was malignant.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.036
That's not good news.

39:17.120 --> 39:21.671
Now, your body scan and blood tests
show that the cancer hasn't spread.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.716
It was local to your testicle.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.236
Which is no longer local to me.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.036
Just to be on the safe side,

39:37.120 --> 39:40.556
<i>to ensure that any residual cells
are killed off,</i>

39:40.640 --> 39:42.631
<i>I recommend you have some radiotherapy.</i>

39:42.720 --> 39:44.676
<i>Do you know what that entails?</i>

39:44.760 --> 39:46.671
Er... Vomiting? More hair falling out?

39:47.400 --> 39:49.356
<i>You're thinking of chemotherapy.</i>

39:49.440 --> 39:51.510
No, you'll keep your own hair.

39:51.600 --> 39:55.275
Though you might find it affects
your fertility.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.757
<i>You may want to bank some of your sperm
in advance.</i>

40:01.680 --> 40:03.636
No, no. I don't think so. No.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.995
Well, in case you ever want children.

40:07.480 --> 40:11.917
Yeah, but you have to be with someone
that you really want to have children with.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.754
Anyway, besides, standing behind a screen,
armed with a test tube.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.195
I don't think so.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.796
They provide magazines.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.313
Oh, yeah?

40:29.720 --> 40:32.393
It's not really my idea
of fatherhood, actually.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.913
Nice offer, though.

40:47.440 --> 40:50.318
David, do you remember
when we tried for a second child

40:50.400 --> 40:52.118
and we stopped cos money was short?

40:53.160 --> 40:54.718
Yeah.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.996
It's not short now, is it?

40:59.400 --> 41:02.312
What, you think it's time we
tried for another?

41:02.400 --> 41:05.756
It would be nice for Josh
to have a younger brother or sister.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.798
Well, yeah, it would...if they got on.

41:10.280 --> 41:13.317
To a large degree
that would be up to Josh, wouldn't it?

41:14.040 --> 41:15.996
Being the eldest.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.076
It is Josh we're talking about, is it?

41:22.400 --> 41:24.550
I think you should give your brother
that money.

41:24.640 --> 41:25.868
Why?

41:25.960 --> 41:28.758
Because otherwise he'll disappoint
your parents.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.068
Good.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.958
David. That's not who you are.

41:34.360 --> 41:37.238
You're not a bitter person.
You're kind and loving.

41:38.440 --> 41:41.910
Absolute crap at showing it...
but that is what you are.

41:44.040 --> 41:48.875
I completely understand you wanting Nick to
lose face, but who are you really hurting?

41:48.960 --> 41:50.916
Your parents, much more than Nick.

41:52.120 --> 41:56.671
They're old. They haven't got much time
left. Do you really want to do that to them?

42:00.640 --> 42:02.870
You really are the most wonderful woman.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.560
<i>Can we have a word, please?</i>

42:46.600 --> 42:48.556
Do you want to come in?

42:48.640 --> 42:50.676
No. I've got a fair old way to go.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.355
I'm calling at my parents' before
heading home.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.836
So. Er...
- Yeah.

43:01.720 --> 43:04.109
Look, I'd really like to see you again.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.077
We've started something
that it'd be a pity not to take further.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.230
Nick, you live in Kent.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.197
For now.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.236
I could live in Manchester.

43:24.960 --> 43:28.316
Huh! I've just had a row with this woman,

43:29.040 --> 43:33.716
because I parked in a space
reserved for shopping families.

43:33.800 --> 43:37.554
Just cos I haven't got a family with me,
doesn't mean I'm not shopping for 'em!

43:37.640 --> 43:39.596
Pete, sit down.
- What?

43:40.600 --> 43:42.431
Sit down. Go on.

43:44.480 --> 43:46.436
Please.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.876
Have you seen Amy lately?
- No.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.750
Have you had any contact with her?
- No.

43:58.480 --> 44:01.790
If we're to have any future together,
you're not to lie.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.512
All right.

44:07.600 --> 44:12.151
She keeps phoning up, right? But I put the
phone straight down. What am I supposed do?

44:12.240 --> 44:14.549
She came round this afternoon.

44:14.640 --> 44:15.868
Right.

44:16.640 --> 44:19.996
Adam was right. She is a nutter.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.516
What are you doing?
- Phoning...the police.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.592
Pete, put the phone down.
- I'm reporting her for harassment.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.910
Pete, put the phone down.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.552
Now, listen.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.596
We had a chat, right?

44:38.320 --> 44:39.992
She's sorry. She's...

44:40.720 --> 44:43.951
She were desperate or summat
when Adam dumped her.

44:44.040 --> 44:48.079
She wished it had never happened. Whatever.
I don't really care. I don't like her.

44:49.200 --> 44:52.237
The reason she's trying to get hold of you
is cos...

44:55.240 --> 44:57.470
...there's a job going at your old firm.

44:57.560 --> 44:59.516
Right?

45:00.480 --> 45:02.436
I don't understand.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.318
I thought you never wanted us
to see each other again.

45:05.400 --> 45:08.790
You wouldn't. It's her job.
She's been transferred. Bristol.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.553
You're joking?
- No.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.790
What, really?

45:16.240 --> 45:18.196
Well...I don't believe it.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.592
What? My house? My family? My job back?

45:24.240 --> 45:26.196
God, I never thought I'd get that.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.156
Two out of three ain't bad, eh?

45:33.160 --> 45:35.799
Excuse me! You could knock.
- You could lock the door.

45:35.880 --> 45:39.429
I've been thinking.
This timing thing, it's bullshit.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.431
You make your own timing.

45:41.520 --> 45:45.638
You miss the moment if you don't seize it
cos you're afraid of what might happen.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.915
A life lived in fear is a life unlived.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.476
Come on, Adam. Admit it.

45:51.560 --> 45:53.755
What we had together, it's still there.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.796
Let's just stop pretending that it isn't.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.311
What about David's brother?

46:00.480 --> 46:03.517
I'd rather play Scrabble with you.
- You'd lose.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.550
I don't care if you're going to die on me.

46:07.480 --> 46:11.473
And I don't care if we can't have children
together. I just want to be together.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.438
Get in the bath.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.315
What?

46:17.400 --> 46:19.630
If you're serious, get in the bath.

46:19.720 --> 46:21.870
I've got all my clothes on.

46:21.960 --> 46:26.397
Hey, lady. I stood on a street naked
with a rose up my arse for you.

46:26.480 --> 46:27.993
This is nothing.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.471
Hello.

46:45.560 --> 46:47.357
Are you going to kiss me?

46:58.400 --> 47:02.518
I'm glad I changed my mind
and opened an account at the sperm bank.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.432
<i>That is 32 points to me!</i>

47:14.560 --> 47:17.358
No, there's no such word as ''snark''.

47:17.440 --> 47:21.718
If you had a bigger dictionary... - You know
the rules. One article of clothing.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.992
This is the last time I play
Scrabble with you.
