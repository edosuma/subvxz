WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:04.789
We're getting a real criminal
element in this club.

00:05.961 --> 00:07.894
What would the A-Team
be doing at Beverly Bay?

00:07.919 --> 00:10.552
There's a major counterfeiting
operation going on at this club.

00:10.591 --> 00:13.524
I knew it. All these
rich folks are crooks.

00:15.252 --> 00:17.953
Do you mind if I play through?

00:18.004 --> 00:19.128
Who the hell are you?

00:19.172 --> 00:21.964
We've got your $2 million
of funny money.

00:22.004 --> 00:24.007
He's history!

00:24.114 --> 00:26.009
I don't think so, sucker!

00:26.454 --> 00:29.429
There's a bomb in that plane that's
set to go off in three minutes.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.848
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:33.916 --> 00:36.019
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.103 --> 00:37.604
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.688 --> 00:39.022
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:40.691
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.774 --> 00:42.317
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.401 --> 00:43.944
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:44.027 --> 00:45.904
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:46.029 --> 00:48.490
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.615 --> 00:49.867
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:49.950 --> 00:52.327
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:12.866 --> 02:14.576
This is the big surprise?

02:14.743 --> 02:15.994
Isn't it fantastic?

02:16.078 --> 02:18.330
Lunch at the Beverly Bay Club.

02:18.455 --> 02:19.831
It's Friday, Face.

02:19.957 --> 02:22.834
Fridays I sneak into Paramount
and try to hustle...

02:22.918 --> 02:24.962
a job out of
a casting director or two.

02:25.087 --> 02:27.047
Yeah, well, your sneaking
days are over, Hannibal.

02:27.172 --> 02:29.925
'Cause Templeton Peck
is moving up in society.

02:40.352 --> 02:41.853
Here you go.

02:45.816 --> 02:48.652
Well, I'll just leave
the keys in the car.

02:50.946 --> 02:54.616
I still don't see how this is going
to turn my acting career around.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.868
Hannibal, you can meet
more producers here...

02:56.952 --> 03:00.706
at one lunch than you can in a whole
year of sneaking onto studio lots.

03:00.789 --> 03:04.293
This is the lunch spot
in Beverly Hills, you know.

03:04.376 --> 03:06.378
For instance, Jeff Sikorsky...

03:06.503 --> 03:09.089
- Head of Bi-Star Productions?
- ...has lunch here every Friday.

03:09.256 --> 03:12.426
Just like clockwork. Always
orders tuna fish and milk.

03:12.509 --> 03:15.262
Now wait a minute, this is a
very exclusive club, Face.

03:15.345 --> 03:17.347
What are you?
Their token fugitive?

03:17.889 --> 03:20.100
Look, I always wanted
to be a member of this place.

03:20.183 --> 03:23.937
Well, I started putting in
applications before I went to Nam.

03:24.146 --> 03:27.232
In fact, I patterned the DMZ
Racquet Club after this place.

03:27.316 --> 03:30.777
Yes, right down to the sauna
and the men's locker room.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.238
Ah, Mr. LeCraw.

03:33.405 --> 03:36.616
Listen, I want you to meet a very
good friend of mine, Hannibal Smith.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.368
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

03:38.452 --> 03:39.870
Listen, Chuck,
I want to thank you...

03:39.995 --> 03:43.165
and the membership committee
again for all you've done.

03:43.248 --> 03:47.502
Well, it was a very close vote, Mr.
Hemmings, but you are in.

03:47.586 --> 03:49.421
And I couldn't be more pleased.

03:50.255 --> 03:54.051
There is still the two-month
trial period, you understand.

03:54.176 --> 03:57.220
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
I'm behind you 100% on that.

03:57.387 --> 04:02.100
We can't be too careful over who we
grant membership into a club like this.

04:02.184 --> 04:05.270
Although, personally, I don't
even see why we need two months.

04:05.354 --> 04:10.150
I mean, I can spot the riffraff
in two days, for crying out loud.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.029
Goodbye.

04:15.113 --> 04:19.785
Mr. Hemmings, this club
is going to cost you a fortune.

04:19.951 --> 04:22.579
Yes, well, obviously,
my background wouldn't fly.

04:22.704 --> 04:24.873
Ashley Hemmings, on the other
hand, prepped at Westminster...

04:24.956 --> 04:26.458
yes, and then went on to Yale.

04:26.541 --> 04:28.710
Yes, captain of the rowing team.

04:28.835 --> 04:32.047
Center-midfielder on
the lacrosse team, you know.

04:32.130 --> 04:35.509
Corporate attorney in Century City,
with a second house in Newport Beach.

04:35.592 --> 04:39.096
Can't wait to see his yacht.
Plane. He flies a plane.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.889
Took me two months
to create this guy.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.725
You know, bank records, credit
ratings, driver's license--

04:43.809 --> 04:45.769
Madras shirt, argyle socks.

04:45.936 --> 04:47.062
Ha-ha!

04:52.651 --> 04:55.445
Two for lunch, Mr...
Hemmings.

04:55.862 --> 04:56.988
This way.

04:58.782 --> 05:01.201
Face, are you sure you're
gonna be comfortable...

05:01.284 --> 05:02.661
being a member of this club?

05:02.744 --> 05:05.580
Hannibal, this is my chance
to be part of the upper crust.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.665
Thank you.

05:06.790 --> 05:10.210
Which, of course,
is where I belong.

05:13.672 --> 05:15.799
But it's Ashley Hemmings
who's being...

05:15.882 --> 05:17.884
part of the upper crust,
not Templeton Peck.

05:17.968 --> 05:19.678
Well, look, I just wanna
go legit, Hannibal.

05:19.761 --> 05:21.555
Now, I don't want
to end up in prison.

05:22.264 --> 05:23.557
Oh, my gosh.

05:23.849 --> 05:25.559
Jeff Sikorsky,
last table on the left.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.936
One of the key movers and
shakers in Hollywood.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.898
Of course, here, he's just
another member of the club.

05:32.190 --> 05:37.070
- I'm not sure about this, Face.
- Ashley. I'm Ashley Hemmings.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.241
Funny, you're a dead ringer
for Templeton Peck.

05:41.408 --> 05:45.036
- What are you doing at my club?
- I'm a guest of Dr. Richter.

05:45.203 --> 05:47.622
Your psychiatrist brings you
to his country club?

05:47.706 --> 05:48.832
Every Friday.

05:48.957 --> 05:51.168
Yes, doubles in the morning,
and a session at lunch.

05:51.293 --> 05:55.380
You see, exercise, it frees up
those associative blockers.

05:55.547 --> 05:57.007
Well, do me a favor, Murdock.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.093
I'm Ashley Hemmings,
and you don't know me.

06:00.177 --> 06:01.303
Oh, what a shame.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.639
I mean, the value of a place like this
is getting to know the right people.

06:04.806 --> 06:07.017
Oh, the doctor's in the locker room.
I'll sign the check.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.894
That's fine, Mr. Murdock.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.146
The man is signing checks.

06:11.229 --> 06:12.939
- There you go.
- See you next Friday.

06:13.064 --> 06:14.274
I'll be here.

06:17.194 --> 06:19.821
I can't even sign checks
for two more months.

06:19.988 --> 06:23.867
You know, Hannibal, you really
should try the hot pecan pie.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.827
Simply scrumptious.

06:27.496 --> 06:29.039
Oh, here he comes.

06:30.165 --> 06:31.291
Keep it up.

06:33.418 --> 06:35.629
Jeff, how's the fish?

06:36.379 --> 06:38.006
Hey, how's the backhand?

06:39.299 --> 06:43.053
Jeff, Jeff Sikorsky, I'd like you to
meet a dear, dear friend of mine.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.096
Hannibal Smith. Jeff Sikorsky.

06:45.263 --> 06:48.183
- How do you do, Mr. Sikorsky?
- Oh, please, Jeff.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.144
"Hannibal Smith."
What a great name.

06:51.228 --> 06:54.898
Hannibal is a very fine actor.
He's just in from New York.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.360
Really? You should shoot
your résumé over to my office.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.987
- Mark it personal and confidential.
- I'll do that, Jeff.

07:01.112 --> 07:02.822
Does that put me in
for the 10%, Jeff?

07:04.115 --> 07:06.785
Means that you can add it
to my tennis losses, H.M.

07:08.538 --> 07:09.677
Listen, I've gotta run.

07:09.710 --> 07:11.497
- It's nice meeting you, Hannibal.
- Same, Jeff.

07:11.522 --> 07:12.536
- Bye.
- Take care.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.544
Well, thanks for the intro.

07:15.627 --> 07:17.963
You told him not to
know you, remember?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.966
You're palling around
with Jeff Sikorsky?

07:21.049 --> 07:23.260
Great exec, lousy tennis player.

07:23.343 --> 07:26.513
Dr. Richter and I are cleaning
his clock at doubles.

07:26.596 --> 07:29.057
Oh, I don't believe this.

07:29.849 --> 07:33.395
- There you are, Ashley.
- Oh, no.

07:35.063 --> 07:39.234
I just had to stop by and tell you
that my daughter Adrian is here today.

07:39.317 --> 07:41.528
- Really?
- Oh, really.

07:41.736 --> 07:44.155
She's playing the front nine.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.909
She'll probably be making the
clubhouse turn at any minute.

07:48.034 --> 07:52.831
So, why don't we go down there and
I will finally introduce you?

07:52.914 --> 07:56.585
Well, see, I'm sort of
busy here, Mrs. Prescott.

07:56.668 --> 08:00.005
Oh, that's okay, Ash,
you go ahead. I'll be fine.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.506
Oh.

08:01.965 --> 08:05.385
Then it's all settled.
See you down there.

08:08.888 --> 08:12.100
Thanks. Boy, is this lunch
turning south.

08:12.642 --> 08:16.146
Oh, Face, the real benefit of a club like
this is getting to know the right people.

08:16.187 --> 08:20.150
Oh, Hannibal, please, this
daughter's gotta be a real woofer.

08:37.958 --> 08:40.544
Well, you're the caddy, it's
your job to mark the lie.

08:42.339 --> 08:43.590
Okay.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.809
I found it.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.812
Give it to me.

09:08.823 --> 09:10.325
What the heck is this?

09:11.660 --> 09:13.411
It's a golf bag. Who would put
a golf bag in the middle of--

09:13.453 --> 09:14.913
Forget the bag.

09:20.085 --> 09:21.336
Adrian.

09:21.878 --> 09:24.964
Adrian, we can't keep
sneaking around like this.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.175
Don't you think we should
tell your mother about us?

09:27.300 --> 09:30.595
No. Absolutely not.
She'd never understand.

09:31.513 --> 09:33.598
Now shut up and kiss me.

09:42.357 --> 09:46.277
Adrian is always off in the rough.
She has a terrible slice.

09:46.403 --> 09:48.363
And maybe
you could correct that.

09:48.446 --> 09:50.966
Yeah, look, maybe we
should do this another time.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.933
Oh, don't be silly. Adrian!

09:52.992 --> 09:54.327
Oh, my gosh. It's my mother.

09:54.411 --> 09:56.121
Where are you, dear?

09:58.456 --> 10:00.500
Mother, what are you doing here?

10:01.209 --> 10:03.878
- So, this is your-- 
- You were due back 20 minutes ago.

10:03.962 --> 10:06.047
Now, I could see
your bag from the patio.

10:06.131 --> 10:10.343
So I just decided
that we would surprise you.

10:10.552 --> 10:12.345
I hate surprises.

10:12.721 --> 10:16.558
This is Ashley Hemmings.
Ashley is an attorney.

10:16.683 --> 10:17.934
Another surprise?

10:18.059 --> 10:19.811
Yes, how do you do?

10:19.894 --> 10:22.147
Excuse me,
mind if we play through?

10:22.230 --> 10:25.108
Go ahead! Come on, Mother,
I'm through for the day.

10:44.669 --> 10:46.880
There's a slice
worse than yours, dear.

10:49.132 --> 10:53.136
Oh, Adrian, perhaps we should
give the gentleman a ride.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.221
We don't pick up hitchhikers.

10:55.305 --> 10:57.182
I thought you two should meet.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.768
You know, we have an extra
ticket to the roast tomorrow.

10:59.934 --> 11:03.313
- Mother, I told you, I'm busy tomorrow.
- Don't be rude, dear.

11:03.688 --> 11:07.108
Rude is trying to marry me
off on the ninth fairway.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.030
Hey, he found our bag.

11:12.197 --> 11:13.823
Hey, you, with the bag!

11:19.037 --> 11:20.580
Keep driving, girls.

11:24.459 --> 11:28.171
Tennis courts are nightlit. There's
an extra putting green there.

11:28.254 --> 11:32.425
That's the front nine, and that's
Faceman chasing someone into the rough.

11:58.368 --> 11:59.994
No shooting in the rough.

12:04.541 --> 12:05.834
Let's get out of here.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.515
Wait for me, guys!

12:46.583 --> 12:48.918
Try to stay off
the fairway, okay, guys?

12:53.590 --> 12:54.966
Move it out of here!
Come on!

12:55.967 --> 12:57.427
Oh, no.

13:09.898 --> 13:11.274
Fore!

13:12.859 --> 13:14.652
Playing through!

13:26.706 --> 13:30.168
Oh, no, not on the green!

13:30.960 --> 13:32.086
Well...

13:32.337 --> 13:34.422
Chuck LeCraw is gonna love this.

13:35.757 --> 13:38.009
<i>You have been a
member for a week...</i>

13:38.092 --> 13:42.555
and we find your golf cart
upside down on the eighth green.

13:42.764 --> 13:44.098
On a green, yet!

13:44.182 --> 13:46.935
Chuck, listen, I'm really
very sorry about all this...

13:47.018 --> 13:49.270
but those two players
were shooting at that caddy.

13:49.354 --> 13:50.840
What two players?

13:51.129 --> 13:53.340
The two players that
jumped over the wall.

13:53.650 --> 13:57.987
Mr. Hemmings, our members usually
leave the club through the lobby.

13:58.071 --> 14:02.116
Well, I don't think these guys
were members. See, they had guns.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.117
Oh.

14:03.242 --> 14:06.704
Well, Andy Brumby, who was
crouched for a putt on seven...

14:06.788 --> 14:09.082
says you had the gun.

14:09.165 --> 14:10.917
- Me? A gun?
- Mmm.

14:11.668 --> 14:14.212
Look, according to
the starter's sheet...

14:14.295 --> 14:19.509
those players were signed in as
guests of a Mr. Bob McKeever.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.011
He claims these
men were brought...

14:22.095 --> 14:24.514
into the club by you,
Mr. McKeever.

14:24.973 --> 14:28.309
Chuck, I didn't have any guests today.
Somebody must have signed my name.

14:28.393 --> 14:29.894
And I thought we had a rule...

14:29.978 --> 14:34.273
about guests signing in with
members present and all that.

14:34.357 --> 14:37.110
You're absolutely right, Bob.

14:37.193 --> 14:41.656
Besides, my guests keep their
firearms mounted on the wall.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.075
Gin.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.618
Super.

14:46.577 --> 14:48.413
Well, boys, that's it.

14:49.330 --> 14:53.292
62, 25 for gin is 87.

14:53.710 --> 14:56.943
Plus the four that you lost
when he knocked.

14:57.588 --> 15:00.383
Well, let's see,
that makes $10 a point and--

15:00.466 --> 15:02.635
$1,862.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.977
- How did you do that?
- Oh, well, it's just a talent I have.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.188
Well, sorry to bother you, Bob.

15:14.731 --> 15:15.982
No bother.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.027
I'm on probation.
Can you believe that?

15:19.110 --> 15:20.486
I'm sorry, Face.

15:20.903 --> 15:21.752
Face?

15:21.863 --> 15:23.239
Hannibal? Ash.

15:23.364 --> 15:25.742
Look, who are you?
What's going on?

15:25.825 --> 15:28.036
We're the guys who know what
you were doing in the rough...

15:28.119 --> 15:29.495
with a caddy
named Frank Pallotta.

15:29.579 --> 15:30.246
So?

15:30.329 --> 15:32.498
So? Honey, the guys
with the guns...

15:32.582 --> 15:35.251
were trying to kill
that caddy friend of yours.

15:35.376 --> 15:38.087
We can't have things like that going
on at the country club, now, can we?

15:38.171 --> 15:39.714
If I were you,
I'd tell us where he is.

15:39.797 --> 15:43.593
Otherwise you may wind up explaining
that to your mother at his funeral.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.428
All right, let's go.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.222
Attorney, huh?

15:50.683 --> 15:51.851
For you, Bob.

15:53.519 --> 15:54.520
Excuse me.

15:55.229 --> 15:55.938
Yeah.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.440
- <i>Any luck?</i>
- Yeah, we got an address...

15:57.523 --> 15:59.150
on that caddy
that grabbed the bag.

15:59.233 --> 16:00.109
Good.

16:00.401 --> 16:03.946
Now you go over there
and terminate the deal.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.490
- You sure?
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

16:05.573 --> 16:08.659
- But make sure you get a refund first.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

16:09.035 --> 16:12.121
Oh, and there's a new member
here named Ashley Hemmings.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.083
I think you may have run
into him on the golf course.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.960
<i>I think that you may wanna
take the time to meet him.</i>

16:18.044 --> 16:19.212
Yes, sir.

16:19.337 --> 16:20.338
Right.

16:22.006 --> 16:23.382
Vice presidents.

16:23.549 --> 16:27.011
You gotta remind them every
day how to conduct business.

16:30.139 --> 16:31.724
Frank, are you home?

16:39.690 --> 16:41.943
Looks like we're not
the only ones on his trail.

16:42.860 --> 16:44.904
Face, you and Adrian
check the bedroom.

16:58.126 --> 16:59.544
Hold it, kid!

17:04.924 --> 17:07.510
I don't have it. Look, I'm
telling you, I don't have it!

17:07.676 --> 17:09.637
Relax, man, your
girlfriend wanna see you.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.226
A golf bag filled with money?

17:15.309 --> 17:17.395
That must have been the reason
they were chasing me.

17:17.811 --> 17:22.650
This bag was packed solid
full of cash, $100 bills.

17:22.817 --> 17:24.026
The golf bag.

17:24.819 --> 17:26.319
What do you think, Face?
What would it hold?

17:26.362 --> 17:29.407
Well, a golf bag's
about three feet high...

17:29.490 --> 17:32.451
and let's say, oh,
16 inches in diameter...

17:32.577 --> 17:35.663
and then there's those little side pockets
where you keep the balls and tees, and...

17:35.746 --> 17:37.957
Yeah, see, each packet
is $10,000..

17:38.040 --> 17:41.085
So, I'd say you could stuff
about $2 million in there...

17:41.169 --> 17:43.045
and still have room
for a couple of golf clubs.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.630
Where's the bag?

17:44.755 --> 17:47.466
Well, I stashed it in the rough
when I jumped over the wall.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.343
The thing was really
slowing me down.

17:49.427 --> 17:51.554
You left $2 million
in the woods?

17:51.637 --> 17:53.014
Money isn't everything, Adrian.

17:53.097 --> 17:55.933
But it ain't nothing. Let's get
that bag before somebody else does.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.518
You locate that caddy?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.770
We tore his place up.
No bag, no caddy--

17:59.854 --> 18:02.648
Find the caddy and make him
take you to the bag.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.567
That means coming
back to the club.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.903
<i>You come on back,
I'll arrange cover for you.</i>

18:07.028 --> 18:11.032
Tell Yelvington to go back to the airport.
We don't want to raise any eyebrows.

18:11.115 --> 18:12.116
Yes, sir.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.832
I think I ran over that way.

18:23.669 --> 18:24.921
Bingo.

18:33.888 --> 18:35.306
Oh, yes.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.563
Take a look.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.608
Funny money.

18:45.816 --> 18:48.027
- It's counterfeit?
- Just paper.

18:48.486 --> 18:52.156
So, we got a bag
full of counterfeit dough...

18:52.198 --> 18:55.201
and two hook-nosed golfers
trying to pick it up.

18:55.284 --> 18:57.119
Those thugs were signed in
with McKeever...

18:57.203 --> 18:59.288
whose guests don't carry guns...

18:59.372 --> 19:02.124
but nonetheless were shooting
at our boy Frank here.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.793
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.629
You just can't waltz
into the Beverly Bay...

19:06.712 --> 19:08.589
and sign in
as a guest of a member.

19:08.673 --> 19:10.716
Nay, they watch this place
pretty close.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.134
Good point, Murdock.

19:12.593 --> 19:14.762
What does this guy McKeever
do for a living?

19:15.221 --> 19:17.223
He's the president
of Merchant Security Bank.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.766
I love it.

19:18.849 --> 19:22.395
I knew it, I knew it. All
these rich folks are crooks.

19:22.478 --> 19:25.690
That is a gross
generalization...

19:25.731 --> 19:28.109
when applied to an entire
sociological target group.

19:28.192 --> 19:29.819
Yeah, but it's true.

19:30.361 --> 19:31.946
Come on, I wanna meet this guy.

19:37.368 --> 19:39.245
Why do we have to hide it here?

19:39.745 --> 19:41.664
Because we have to
get to it quickly.

19:41.747 --> 19:44.250
This is just temporary.

19:44.458 --> 19:47.503
I'm doomed. I'll never
get off probation now.

19:47.646 --> 19:50.899
I can say I "was" a member
of Beverly Bay Club.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.341
Yeah, for a week.

19:52.717 --> 19:55.928
All right, we got a bag of
funny money and a banker.

19:56.053 --> 19:57.638
Now, what else do we know
about McKeever?

19:57.722 --> 20:00.725
- He plays gin for $10 a point.
- Golf, too.

20:00.808 --> 20:04.979
I've heard talk around the club
about his game. It's high stakes.

20:05.146 --> 20:07.732
I think McKeever's handicap
is about an eight.

20:07.815 --> 20:08.607
Hmm.

20:08.691 --> 20:12.445
A gambler. I bet the guy
just hates to lose. Okay.

20:13.237 --> 20:14.739
We'll get him in a golf game.

20:14.905 --> 20:17.867
Face, you and Murdock get rid of whomever
he's supposed to play with today.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.537
Well, how do you propose
to meet McKeever?

20:21.746 --> 20:24.498
Well, we're all members of
the same club, right, Face?

20:27.418 --> 20:28.919
No! We're...

20:35.593 --> 20:37.094
How you doing, sweetheart?

20:37.928 --> 20:39.388
Nice to see you all.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.852
Well, my goodness, you really
like those walnuts, don't you?

20:45.102 --> 20:46.437
Oh, I love them.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.565
They're full of vitamins,
minerals, linoleic acid.

20:49.732 --> 20:51.442
That's what I keep
telling the little missus.

20:51.525 --> 20:53.319
- Bob McKeever.
- Hannibal Smith.

20:53.402 --> 20:56.113
You know, I found a great way
to get rid of the shells.

20:56.197 --> 21:00.201
- Yeah? What's that?
- I just started tossing them.

21:00.868 --> 21:05.581
I can sit on my back porch and
throw them 30 yards into my lake.

21:05.684 --> 21:07.596
Impossible. Too light.

21:07.621 --> 21:10.026
No, all you have to do
is work on your throw.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.879
See, you start with a whole nut.

21:12.254 --> 21:14.799
Then you get down, you can
pitch those shells a mile.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.343
It's like working out
with a medicine ball.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.679
How far would you say it is
to the ninth tee over there?

21:21.180 --> 21:22.515
Fifty, sixty yards.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.310
- I can toss a walnut over that tee.
- Impossible. Too light.

21:26.435 --> 21:27.395
For $100?

21:27.436 --> 21:30.815
- Are you trying to hustle me, Mr.Smith?
- No.

21:31.148 --> 21:33.401
For nothing. Gentlemen's bet.
What do you say, Bob?

21:33.484 --> 21:36.445
$500 says you can't pitch it
over the ninth tee.

21:36.570 --> 21:38.948
$500? That's kind of steep.

21:39.031 --> 21:42.493
Come on, it's action. No fun
if there's no risk, hmm?

21:45.121 --> 21:46.205
Okay.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.638
- You play golf?
- Sure.

22:02.847 --> 22:05.891
- Want a chance to win your money back?
- You bet I do.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.353
Yep, we've got to play someday.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.606
It's too bad that
I've got a partner today.

22:12.690 --> 22:15.442
There you are.
Five Ben Franklins.

22:15.693 --> 22:17.820
- I'll see you.
- You bet.

22:21.866 --> 22:25.494
Gluing that ball bearing in
that walnut shell was perfect.

22:25.661 --> 22:27.538
Go to work on the golf balls.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.249
It's gonna be good, Hannibal.

22:35.713 --> 22:37.131
Pretty good, pretty good.

22:37.214 --> 22:39.967
All right, once again, now. Don't break
the wrist. Keep it down like this.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.469
- Nice and tight.
- Jimmy, listen...

22:42.761 --> 22:44.263
My favorite grip.

22:44.805 --> 22:48.142
All right, listen, I'm looking
for Bob McKeever's golf partner.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.560
Yeah, I just met the gentleman.

22:49.643 --> 22:51.645
He's over there, putting
his clubs in the cart.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.314
- Thanks.
- You got it.

22:59.236 --> 23:01.113
Unbelievable.

23:01.238 --> 23:03.866
Of all the country clubs
in Los Angeles...

23:03.949 --> 23:07.786
General Fulbright has to be
a member of my club.

23:07.912 --> 23:09.398
Face, you're gonna to
have to get plastic surgery.

23:09.423 --> 23:10.313
No, I'm not.

23:10.372 --> 23:11.972
Face, we got to dangle the
fox in front of the hounds.

23:11.997 --> 23:12.766
No, we don't.

23:12.791 --> 23:14.460
Face, it's got to be you.
It can't be me, because--

23:14.543 --> 23:16.253
No! No! Listen, you
have got to be a caddy.

23:16.337 --> 23:17.379
You've got to be kidding.

23:17.463 --> 23:19.015
No. Oh, and have my
car brought around front.

23:19.040 --> 23:19.861
I will not!

23:19.886 --> 23:21.460
- Tip the guy a buck.
- No!

23:25.137 --> 23:27.389
Ashley, I've been looking
all over for you.

23:27.473 --> 23:29.975
Mrs. Prescott, listen, I really
can't stop and chat right now.

23:30.059 --> 23:32.186
I just wanted to apologize
for Adrian's behavior.

23:32.269 --> 23:34.897
All is forgiven,
now if you'll excuse me, I--

23:36.106 --> 23:37.149
Peck!

23:44.865 --> 23:46.659
Excuse me, ladies.

24:04.009 --> 24:05.844
What is going on here?

24:10.182 --> 24:14.144
That's it! He's history!

24:34.999 --> 24:37.293
What do you mean, he's
called away on business?

24:37.334 --> 24:39.753
He's a general.
What are we, at war?

24:40.004 --> 24:41.880
The general, he sends
his regrets, sir.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.759
Great. Now who the hell
am I supposed to play?

24:54.935 --> 24:56.562
Mr. Smith.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.522
Well, Mr. McKeever.

24:58.647 --> 25:01.358
Yeah.
The walnut pitcher.

25:01.608 --> 25:05.112
- How'd you like to play nine?
- Sure. What are the stakes?

25:05.321 --> 25:07.740
$500 a hole too rich
for your blood?

25:07.865 --> 25:10.200
No, $500 would be
just about right.

25:10.367 --> 25:11.535
Great.

25:12.619 --> 25:14.705
- It's gonna be fun.
- You betcha.

25:23.964 --> 25:25.257
Nice shot.

25:49.573 --> 25:51.283
That is quite a hook.

25:51.492 --> 25:54.912
Yeah, I can never tell where
the heck it's gonna land.

25:56.121 --> 25:57.998
What did you say that
you did for a living?

25:58.082 --> 26:00.584
Well, I recover valuable
objects for people.

26:15.891 --> 26:18.185
I always thought this green
broke the other way.

26:18.394 --> 26:19.520
Must be all the rain.

26:19.645 --> 26:23.273
You're quite a player,
Mr. Smith. You're up $500.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.484
Your honor.

27:21.623 --> 27:24.710
Hello, this is Ashley Hemmings.
I'd like an outside line, please.

27:25.502 --> 27:26.837
Hemmings.

27:38.765 --> 27:40.267
You got a real soft touch, boss.

27:40.476 --> 27:41.477
Mmm.

27:48.025 --> 27:50.152
Yeah, Trans Allied Express?

27:50.235 --> 27:53.697
This is Bob McKeever,
Merchant Security Bank...

27:53.780 --> 27:56.408
and, well, there's something
I need to check.

27:59.119 --> 28:02.331
I lost them. I
can't believe they got away.

28:02.456 --> 28:04.833
But at least they'll be back.

28:05.209 --> 28:06.627
Seems unlikely, sir.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.587
Believe me, Sergeant,
they'll be back.

28:08.837 --> 28:12.007
They're here.
I can smell them.

28:19.223 --> 28:21.308
Run me a shower,
Sergeant. Hot.

28:34.488 --> 28:35.948
Pressure's on, Bob.

28:52.673 --> 28:55.384
Well, you got to hit it.

29:21.535 --> 29:22.536
Chuck!

29:22.619 --> 29:23.912
I was just looking for you.

29:23.996 --> 29:27.165
Listen, about those statues...

29:29.334 --> 29:30.460
I'm sorry.

29:39.219 --> 29:41.430
A double bogey. Another
hole for me, Bob.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.640
Yes, I'm down six holes to two.

29:44.224 --> 29:48.020
That's $2,000. What do you say we play
for double or nothing on the ninth hole?

29:48.103 --> 29:50.063
Well, I haven't been completely
straight with you, Bob.

29:50.147 --> 29:51.523
Remember what I do for a living?

29:51.607 --> 29:52.608
You're some kind of a locator.

29:52.691 --> 29:55.027
Right, and I've located
something you want.

29:55.110 --> 29:56.278
Maybe we could play for that.

29:56.737 --> 29:59.031
What could you possibly
have that I want?

30:02.200 --> 30:03.493
It's our stuff, boss.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.788
Who the hell are you?

30:08.832 --> 30:10.042
We're the A-Team...

30:10.792 --> 30:13.712
and we've got your $2 million
of funny money.

30:13.879 --> 30:16.381
But I'm willing
to let it ride...

30:16.923 --> 30:17.841
on the last hole.

30:17.883 --> 30:20.844
- What's my side?
- You win, you get the money, I walk.

30:21.053 --> 30:24.848
I win, you still get the
money, but you give us 50%.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.559
We're getting a real criminal
element in this club.

30:27.643 --> 30:29.728
We'll have to speak to the
membership committee about it.

30:30.812 --> 30:31.938
You're on.

31:00.676 --> 31:02.803
Well, it looks like
your luck is changing.

31:49.766 --> 31:51.601
No, no, I insist, Bob.

31:52.436 --> 31:55.147
You go ahead,
it'll add to the suspense.

31:56.398 --> 31:57.899
You asked for it.

32:07.242 --> 32:08.493
That's a gimme.

32:16.626 --> 32:18.587
Well, you'll have to
sink that to win.

32:19.296 --> 32:20.881
Are you ready to concede?

32:21.548 --> 32:24.676
Are you kidding? This is
the best part of my game.

32:40.025 --> 32:40.984
Ha!

32:41.067 --> 32:42.152
Game.

32:43.445 --> 32:44.529
Not quite.

32:46.156 --> 32:47.616
I'll have my money.

32:47.908 --> 32:50.202
Are you gonna pull guns right
here on the golf course?

32:50.285 --> 32:51.369
You've got it.

32:51.870 --> 32:52.996
Okay.

32:56.666 --> 32:59.169
Why are you sticking
your noses into all this?

32:59.294 --> 33:02.422
'Cause you stink up
the entire country club...

33:04.758 --> 33:06.802
and you got
my favorite caddy fired.

33:06.968 --> 33:09.179
We caddies are a rough bunch.

33:16.353 --> 33:18.271
What would the A-Team
be doing at Beverly Bay?

33:18.396 --> 33:19.856
Doesn't make sense, General.

33:24.236 --> 33:27.572
No, not in my club,
they don't. Come on.

33:43.171 --> 33:44.840
Nice shot, Colonel.

33:48.885 --> 33:49.970
Look at that.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.972
Come on, let's go.

33:57.727 --> 33:58.728
Fulbright!

34:15.453 --> 34:18.498
I'm out.
I can't believe I'm out.

34:18.998 --> 34:20.625
Months of hard work
down the drain.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.793
Just because of a few...

34:23.210 --> 34:24.254
indiscretions.

34:24.337 --> 34:27.674
- Just because I shower fully dressed--
- Face. Face.

34:27.757 --> 34:29.175
What?
What did you find out?

34:29.301 --> 34:32.178
Oh, yeah, yeah,
Trans Allied Express.

34:32.262 --> 34:35.514
Yeah, they transport
cash for banks.

34:35.599 --> 34:37.934
And guess who one
of their biggest clients is?

34:38.018 --> 34:41.855
- Merchant Security Bank. Bob McKeever.
- Bingo.

34:42.147 --> 34:43.607
And did they throw him
out of the club?

34:43.690 --> 34:46.318
No, no, no, he's still a member.

34:46.400 --> 34:50.030
Yeah, well, anyway, they've got a
huge load going out later today.

34:51.447 --> 34:53.742
Does the club own that
wooded area back there?

34:53.824 --> 34:54.826
Yeah.

34:56.995 --> 35:01.166
I think they're storing the counterfeit
money somewhere in those woods.

35:01.791 --> 35:05.420
You stumbled on a pick-up point when
you found that golf bag in the rough.

35:05.503 --> 35:08.298
I don't understand. What's it
got to do with the airport?

35:08.381 --> 35:12.344
McKeever's bank ships cash cross-country
using Trans Allied Express.

35:12.469 --> 35:16.264
Now, I think McKeever intends
to take the bank's cash...

35:16.348 --> 35:18.767
and switch it
for the counterfeit money.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.769
But just to have
the right kind of ashes...

35:20.852 --> 35:22.812
'cause I'll bet
right after the switch...

35:22.938 --> 35:24.022
the plane blows up.

35:24.147 --> 35:27.192
Then the pilot
just bails on out.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.152
And the counterfeit
money burns...

35:29.235 --> 35:33.865
and McKeever winds up with $2
million, real money, in cash.

35:33.990 --> 35:35.367
Which no one is looking for...

35:35.450 --> 35:38.620
because it supposedly
burned up in the crash.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.747
- That's a pretty good plan, Hannibal.
- Yeah.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.917
Is there a shack
or something back in there?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.962
Oh, yeah, there's this old boarded-up
building that Adrian and I...

35:47.587 --> 35:48.630
ran across.

35:48.713 --> 35:52.968
Face, you and Frank, go back, get
into the club, and find that shack.

35:53.134 --> 35:56.012
Keep your eye on it. When they're
ready to move, let us know.

35:56.096 --> 35:58.098
Take a walkie-talkie.
We'll get ready for them here.

35:58.181 --> 36:00.350
Colonel, there's just
one little problem:

36:00.684 --> 36:02.268
I'm no longer a member.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.687
Oh, I can sneak you in.

36:03.770 --> 36:04.604
You can?

36:04.688 --> 36:05.814
Sure, I do it all the time.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.191
You would be surprised how many
people out there on the course...

36:08.274 --> 36:09.317
aren't even members.

36:09.401 --> 36:13.321
No security. No respect for new members.
Criminals playing gin.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.907
You know something? I'm glad
I'm not a member of this club.

36:16.032 --> 36:18.201
- So are we, Face.
- Yeah, who needs it?

36:50.734 --> 36:53.319
- Mr. Hemmings.
- Chuck!

36:53.528 --> 36:55.321
What are you doing here?

36:55.488 --> 36:58.158
Trying to sneak into
Beverly Bay now, are we?

36:58.241 --> 37:01.202
Well, look, Chuck, I know
haven't been a model member...

37:01.286 --> 37:04.122
but we've discovered something
you are not gonna believe.

37:04.205 --> 37:07.459
Mr. Hemmings, I am not interested
in anything you have to say.

37:07.542 --> 37:10.378
Now, will you please leave the
property before I call the police?

37:10.462 --> 37:11.588
And you too, son.

37:11.671 --> 37:14.007
There's a major counterfeiting
operation going on at this club.

37:14.090 --> 37:16.229
Right. You see, there's
a shed back there--

37:16.254 --> 37:17.284
Wait a minute.

37:17.343 --> 37:19.262
What were you doing back there?

37:19.554 --> 37:21.765
Well, that's a long story.

37:21.848 --> 37:25.935
But that shed is being used to
store some very funny money.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.229
And Bob McKeever's
behind the whole thing.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.647
- Bob McKeever, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:29.731 --> 37:31.524
Well, that's quite
an accusation.

37:31.691 --> 37:34.778
But even if it is true, you
won't live to tell about it.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.698
Oh, Chuck, not you, too.

37:38.782 --> 37:40.241
I'm afraid so.

37:40.408 --> 37:44.871
Yeah, well, actually, it restores
my faith in human nature.

38:06.476 --> 38:07.560
Excuse me.

38:14.776 --> 38:17.695
<i>Please take your seats now.
Thank you very much.</i>

38:21.157 --> 38:22.200
Hi.

38:24.619 --> 38:26.663
<i>As General
Fulbright once told me...</i>

38:26.830 --> 38:28.623
<i>”If you have
an intellectual problem...</i>

38:28.790 --> 38:30.041
<i>"ask an officer.</i>

38:30.416 --> 38:32.418
<i>"He'll know a sergeant
who knows the answer."</i>

38:35.880 --> 38:37.674
<i>You know, when I went into the Army...
That waiter.</i>

38:37.710 --> 38:38.700
<i>...they asked me my religion.</i>

38:38.725 --> 38:39.955
- That's Peck.
- <i>I told him I was a devout...</i>

38:40.260 --> 38:42.095
- I need you to help out on the dais.
- But--

38:42.178 --> 38:44.389
- Just do it, please.
- Right.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.474
I'm telling
you, that waiter's Peck.

38:46.891 --> 38:48.268
Begging the General's
pardon, sir...

38:48.393 --> 38:50.395
but I think you've got
A-Team on the brain.

38:51.980 --> 38:53.606
<i>You know something?
This stuff kills me...</i>

38:53.690 --> 38:55.525
<i>and I wish it'd kill you.</i>

38:57.110 --> 38:59.279
<i>General Fulbright
confided in me...</i>

38:59.487 --> 39:02.532
<i>he said, ”Shecky,
in 30 years in the Army...</i>

39:02.991 --> 39:04.662
<i>I only had one disappointment:</i>

39:04.763 --> 39:07.871
<i>”I never once...saw Bob Hope.”</i>

39:09.706 --> 39:12.083
<i>Let me tell you something else
about this wonderful man.</i>

39:12.417 --> 39:14.127
<i>He's a soldier's general.</i>

39:14.544 --> 39:17.923
<i>He once said to me, "Shecky,
I slept in a pup tent."</i>

39:17.948 --> 39:19.431
- Peck!
- Who?

39:22.677 --> 39:24.012
What's happening?

39:24.345 --> 39:26.556
Could you give me a hand, Mr.
Greene? Thank you.

39:30.226 --> 39:32.979
Stop him! Stop that man!
He's one of the A-Team!

39:41.529 --> 39:45.992
Ashley, you're a waiter.
Oh, no, it's a smoking jacket.

40:06.304 --> 40:07.597
<i>These guys are
armed to the teeth.</i>

40:07.680 --> 40:09.057
Got you, Lieutenant. Out.

40:10.642 --> 40:13.228
We're gonna need
something outrageous.

40:15.772 --> 40:17.148
The A-Team, huh?

40:17.357 --> 40:18.816
They've got another
thought coming...

40:18.900 --> 40:20.526
if they think they're
gonna stop this load.

40:20.735 --> 40:21.694
All right.

41:05.321 --> 41:07.156
Pretty quiet.
I like it.

41:07.282 --> 41:08.825
Well, set the timer
and you're off.

41:08.866 --> 41:10.076
See you in a few days.

41:32.015 --> 41:34.851
Hey, is this the flight
to Cucamonga?

41:35.018 --> 41:37.312
We're all fueled up.
You've got the wrong plane.

41:37.437 --> 41:39.063
I don't think so, sucker!

42:17.685 --> 42:21.564
Hey, Hannibal, we got big trouble.
Fulbright's right on my tail.

42:25.234 --> 42:27.862
There's a bomb in that plane that's
set to go off in three minutes.

42:28.154 --> 42:30.156
Murdock, get this
plane in the air.

42:30.948 --> 42:32.700
B.A., get the van.

44:05.001 --> 44:08.004
Do you mind if I play through?

44:15.219 --> 44:17.054
Well, this is typical.

44:17.180 --> 44:19.390
One minute, you're the member
of an exclusive club...

44:19.515 --> 44:22.226
the next minute, you're a waiter.
A fake waiter.

44:22.351 --> 44:24.854
I'm sorry about you
losing your membership.

44:25.813 --> 44:28.149
Why don't you become
one of Dr. Richter's patients?

44:28.191 --> 44:30.818
Then maybe he can bring
you here as a guest.

44:30.943 --> 44:32.862
Yeah, look on
the bright side, Face.

44:33.070 --> 44:35.865
Chuck LeCraw and Bob McKeever
lost their memberships, too.

44:36.073 --> 44:38.910
Yeah, they'll probably start
their own club in prison.

44:39.035 --> 44:41.287
Well, we did gain
one new member.

44:41.746 --> 44:43.706
Frank and I are getting married.

44:44.457 --> 44:45.750
Congratulations.

44:45.833 --> 44:48.753
I really wanna thank you guys
for giving me the arrest...

44:48.794 --> 44:50.838
and letting me collect
the insurance company reward.

44:50.922 --> 44:52.298
I guess I'm finally one of them.

44:52.423 --> 44:53.466
Too bad.

44:53.549 --> 44:54.508
What about your mother?

44:54.592 --> 44:56.886
Frank insists we invite
her to the wedding.

44:58.304 --> 44:59.388
It's time.

45:00.806 --> 45:04.143
Hannibal, are you sure you
wanna go through with this?

45:04.227 --> 45:08.731
Face, this is the
opportunity of a lifetime.

45:09.273 --> 45:11.359
He will never forget it.

45:11.525 --> 45:15.404
And besides, it took them two
days to put this roast together.

45:15.488 --> 45:17.156
It's the least we can do.

45:17.365 --> 45:18.324
Okay.

45:19.992 --> 45:22.620
<i>I was in the Army two days when
General Fulbright stopped me...</i>

45:22.703 --> 45:26.374
<i>and he said, "What's the matter, soldier?
Don't you see this uniform?"</i>

45:26.666 --> 45:29.794
<i>I said, "What are you complaining about?
Take a look at the rag they gave me."</i>

45:31.295 --> 45:33.047
<i>But you wanna know
something, General?</i>

45:33.297 --> 45:36.968
<i>I was a good soldier.
I saved 280 men.</i>

45:37.343 --> 45:38.636
<i>I shot the cook.</i>

45:44.100 --> 45:45.268
What's this?

45:52.858 --> 45:54.986
You're gonna love this, General.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.408
<i>We got a critic in the room.</i>

46:01.242 --> 46:03.202
<i>I understand we have
a very special friend...</i>

46:03.286 --> 46:04.870
<i>of the General's
here with us tonight.</i>

46:04.954 --> 46:06.580
<i>He'd like to pay his respects.</i>

46:06.789 --> 46:09.166
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, let's
have a nice, warm welcome...</i>

46:09.333 --> 46:11.669
<i>for Colonel
John "Hannibal" Smith.</i>

46:15.256 --> 46:17.800
<i>Shecky, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

46:17.967 --> 46:21.929
<i>I'd like to say a few words
about General "Bull" Fulbright.</i>

46:22.138 --> 46:24.098
<i>A man I've known all my life.</i>

46:24.598 --> 46:28.436
<i>Needless to say, we don't
call him "Bull" for nothing.</i>
