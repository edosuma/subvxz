01:08.985 --> 01:12.113
I thought about saving a piece
of the old front room for check-in,

01:12.197 --> 01:13.490
but I've been talking to Skeeter

01:13.573 --> 01:16.326
about moving the reception desk
over here...

01:17.160 --> 01:19.079
-instead.
-Okay.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.872
So guests check in for workouts,

01:20.955 --> 01:22.957
and they sign up for massages

01:23.041 --> 01:26.544
and any of the wonderfully indulgent
self-care options

01:26.628 --> 01:27.921
that we'll have upstairs,

01:28.004 --> 01:30.632
and that way, we have a nice bit
of cross-traffic.

01:30.715 --> 01:31.925
Mm-hmm.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.761
Women can be intrigued by what's going on
in other areas

01:34.844 --> 01:36.387
and they'll want to explore.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.348
Can we get a peek?

01:43.853 --> 01:44.938
[gasps]

01:45.438 --> 01:47.190
-[chuckles]
-Oh, wow.

01:48.566 --> 01:52.195
Agh, you know, I've tried to picture it,
but I just didn't imagine

01:52.278 --> 01:55.031
that... that it would be so...

01:55.615 --> 01:56.866
wonderful.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.660
And so terrifying,

01:58.743 --> 02:00.411
you know, but in a good way

02:00.495 --> 02:04.165
'cause it's-- it's exciting...
and-- and challenging,

02:04.249 --> 02:06.709
but don't worry
because I'm fully on board.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.752
[Maddie] So am I.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.588
[sighs] I'm sorry I'm late. [chuckles]

02:11.422 --> 02:14.634
I told you I was a little out of practice
with the whole work-life juggling,

02:14.717 --> 02:16.594
but I promise I will get it down
before we open.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.513
Well, good, then you can teach me.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.683
[chuckles] Wow. Goodness, this is...

02:22.433 --> 02:24.060
This is going to be beautiful.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.354
-Yeah.
-[Maddie] I can't believe it's ours.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.398
[laughs]

02:28.481 --> 02:31.860
-Man, we've had some good times here.
-[Dana Sue] Yeah.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.444
Some of us more than others.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.613
[laughs]

02:37.615 --> 02:40.535
Can we focus on what this place means
to everyone, please?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.078
-It means a lot to us.
-[thud]

02:42.162 --> 02:43.037
Oh.

02:46.833 --> 02:47.834
[Helen] Oh, my.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.004
Oh. I got it, Ms. Helen,
my mess, my apologies.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.423
-If you're sure, Max.
-Yes, ma'am.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.009
Please don't tell Skeeter.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.014
[whispering] Oh, my God.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.560
-[Helen] Let's buzz on through. Maddie.
-Yes.

03:05.643 --> 03:09.022
Your priorities are marketing materials
and gym equipment.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.481
-We can get to the soft goods...
-Okay.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.482
...a little bit later.

03:11.566 --> 03:14.027
I did tell Skeeter
to run all interior design by you.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.488
And, Dana Sue, I know how swamped
you must be at Sullivan's,

03:17.572 --> 03:19.657
so just focus on the cafe equipment.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.700
The menu can wait.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.619
And stay on budget.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.539
When are we aiming to open?

03:27.457 --> 03:29.083
Uh, Ms. Frances' birthday.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.296
Helen Decatur, you are out
of your overly ambitious mind.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.714
[Helen] It's not until next month.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.425
I know the schedule
is a little bit challenging,

03:37.508 --> 03:39.761
but with tenacity
and a little grace from the angels,

03:39.844 --> 03:40.970
we can pull this off.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.014
-[Helen] I believe in us.
-[Maddie] Okay.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.684
Yeah.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.222
Addison. Avery.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.058
I don't know if you remember me,

04:27.141 --> 04:28.977
but I was friends with your parents.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.563
I was also their lawyer,
which means that it was my job

04:32.647 --> 04:34.732
to help them
make some pretty big decisions.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.901
Now it's my job to help you.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.404
Your aunt Charlotte
and your godfather Nolan,

04:39.487 --> 04:41.239
they both want to take care of you.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.909
But it's-- it's not a job
that they can share.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.787
Does that make sense?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.295
[bell ringing]

05:01.134 --> 05:02.552
[indistinct chatter]

05:04.053 --> 05:04.929
[sighs]

05:05.471 --> 05:06.597
Here, let me help you.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.766
Oh. Hi, thank you.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.062
Oh, this is lovely. You're an artist?

05:13.396 --> 05:14.856
My mother's the artist.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.983
I am an unemployed marketing major.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.026
[chuckles]

05:18.776 --> 05:20.153
Well, they're beautiful.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.113
It's the poster for the spring play.

05:22.196 --> 05:25.491
I volunteered to design the flyer
for a play Kyle did in the 5th grade,

05:25.575 --> 05:26.659
and no one explained to me that meant

05:26.743 --> 05:28.661
that I would be the poster
and program parent for everything

05:28.745 --> 05:29.746
until college.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.623
[exhales]

05:34.042 --> 05:35.084
[chuckles]

05:35.168 --> 05:36.419
Uh, listen, um...

05:37.337 --> 05:38.379
I need to apologize.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.340
No. Wait, why would...

05:40.423 --> 05:41.466
Uh, no. [chuckles]

05:41.549 --> 05:43.051
Our last conversation.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.136
I was trying to figure out
what was going on with Ty,

05:45.219 --> 05:47.388
and I didn't realize or...

05:48.348 --> 05:51.726
I hadn't heard about
you and Dr. Townsend and your, um...

05:51.809 --> 05:54.395
Oh, you can go ahead
and say messy divorce.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.730
God knows everyone else does.

05:56.230 --> 06:00.026
That cat is way out of the bag,
and my skin is getting thicker by the day.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.402
Still,

06:01.819 --> 06:02.653
I'm sorry.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.490
Thank you.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.576
So, I understand what I'm asking.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.705
But I think that you and Dr. Townsend
and I need to have a meeting

06:12.789 --> 06:14.374
about how this is impacting Ty.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.042
Did Ty talk to you?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.920
No, but there are some issues
we need to discuss.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.297
Yeah, okay.

06:21.672 --> 06:25.635
Uh... I'll speak with Bill,
and I'll get right back to you.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.595
-Okay.
-Thanks.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.824
Charlotte, I'm so sorry for your loss.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.159
I knew your sister and your brother-in-law

06:50.243 --> 06:52.787
socially as well as professionally.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.580
They were special.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.999
Everyone said such lovely things.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.545
I've been writin' them down so I can
share them with the girls one day...

07:01.671 --> 07:02.880
when they're not so sad.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.674
I'm sure they'll appreciate that.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.634
They're all I have left.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.848
What do you like to do with your nieces
when you get together?

07:13.141 --> 07:14.016
Bake cookies.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.893
Do puzzles. [chuckles]

07:16.853 --> 07:17.812
And sing.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.983
Charlotte, as I'm sure you know,

07:22.066 --> 07:25.194
though Rachel and Troy,
uh, never finalized their will,

07:25.278 --> 07:26.404
they did set up a trust,

07:26.487 --> 07:29.824
so the financial burden
on the girls' guardian should be minimal.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.869
Rachel always had an eye on the future.

07:33.744 --> 07:34.996
-Bless her.
-Hmm.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.998
Did you inherit your parents' house?

07:39.041 --> 07:42.795
I stayed in our home with my parents.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.382
Nursed them both right up to the very end.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.844
Rachel and Troy worked too much to help,

07:49.927 --> 07:51.596
not that I'm complainin'.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.931
I did what needed to be done.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.559
I've always doted on Rachel's girls,

07:56.642 --> 07:59.228
since I was never blessed
with babies of my own.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.856
Do you have children, Ms. Decatur?

08:03.649 --> 08:05.485
Uh, no. No.

08:06.527 --> 08:10.031
But I am an aunt and a godmother
to some wonderful boys and girls.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.117
Children are God's expression of hope.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.245
That's what Mama said.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.374
[indistinct chatter]

08:25.004 --> 08:27.089
Hey, Annie. You're riding with us today.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.008
Yeah, I remember.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.219
Drama was crazy.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.096
David still isn't off-book,
Mr. Paulsy was losing it--

08:34.180 --> 08:36.807
Hey, did you hear about
what happened to the Calhouns?

08:36.891 --> 08:40.186
Uh, yeah, yeah. Car accident. Awful.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.564
I've been babysitting the girls
since Avery was three.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.609
I can't even imagine
what they're going through.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.402
Yeah.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.697
It's-- It's gotta suck.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.756
[taps cards against table]

09:10.132 --> 09:11.759
So, what brings you here?

09:12.343 --> 09:13.928
I'm looking for doorknobs.

09:15.054 --> 09:15.972
Here?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.516
Well, I went by the hardware store,
but it's closed.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.352
Yeah, I am through with work today.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.485
So these doorknobs of yours,

09:30.278 --> 09:32.697
they for your, uh, renovation
out at Ms. Frances's?

09:32.780 --> 09:33.739
Yes, sir.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.158
You should go with the brushed finish.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.411
That way, you won't have to be
polishing 'em every night.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.453
Excellent point.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.956
You come around to the store tomorrow
after I open up again,

09:42.039 --> 09:43.708
-I'll give you a deal.
-Thank you.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.168
If I open up again.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.299
I'm sorry
business has been going so badly.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.384
Not so much that I'm going outta business,

09:53.467 --> 09:56.304
as business just kinda going outta me.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.140
Thought that Pickle Jar
was gonna be the answer,

09:59.223 --> 10:00.891
but, uh, we sent 'em packing.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.312
I couldn't advise the Whartons
or any of you

10:04.395 --> 10:05.896
to take such an unfair deal.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.357
Mmm. You were absolutely right.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.692
[chuckles]

10:09.775 --> 10:10.651
And Mary Vaughn?

10:11.235 --> 10:13.904
She is having herself
a bonnet full of bees right now

10:13.988 --> 10:15.990
'cause we all listened to you and not her.

10:16.073 --> 10:16.949
[both laugh]

10:17.033 --> 10:19.160
Might just be worth another lap
before the finish.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.328
Collins.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.329
[laughs]

10:21.829 --> 10:23.789
Eh, if Kevin were still here,

10:25.750 --> 10:27.835
he'd have told me nope right off the bat.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.589
But Kevin's not here.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.924
Can't imagine how much
you must miss your brother.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.552
Especially after working with him
every day.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.556
It's supposed to be "sons."

10:42.391 --> 10:43.434
Not just "son."

10:44.477 --> 10:45.978
Your people may be gone...

10:49.315 --> 10:50.399
but you're not alone.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.904
[Max] Afternoon, Mr. Littlefield.
Ms. Helen.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.238
Where should I put these?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.239
Um...

10:57.948 --> 11:02.119
These are some books that
Ms. Frances left at the house, Collins,

11:02.203 --> 11:05.790
and I thought you might enjoy adding them
here to the Post library.

11:05.873 --> 11:06.832
Oh.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.796
You can put 'em over there, young fella.

11:13.005 --> 11:13.881
Helen?

11:14.840 --> 11:15.841
What is this?

11:15.925 --> 11:17.551
I'm making a donation.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.594
Mmm.

11:19.136 --> 11:20.304
But while we're here...

11:22.682 --> 11:24.350
you and Max should have a little chat.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.643
[scoffs]

11:25.726 --> 11:27.103
Why would we do that?

11:27.186 --> 11:28.562
Well, Max works for Skeeter.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.732
He's a hard worker, sweet kid.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.275
But he's green,

11:34.235 --> 11:36.779
and Skeeter doesn't have any time
to train him properly.

11:40.408 --> 11:44.370
Sometimes the future can come
from an unexpected direction.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.038
Well...

11:47.748 --> 11:50.209
I guess it wouldn't hurt to have a chat.

11:54.130 --> 11:54.964
Hey.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.432
-Say, young fella.
-Hello, sir.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.017
So what do you do for Skeeter?

12:11.605 --> 12:13.816
Hey. Tyler, hang on a second.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.195
Coach Maddox wants to meet with me
and your father

12:18.279 --> 12:20.698
to talk about the issues
that you've been having at school.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.243
Of course he does.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.703
What's that supposed to mean?

12:26.912 --> 12:27.872
Seriously?

12:29.206 --> 12:30.958
Wh-- What do you want from me, Mom?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.336
How do you think you'd be doing
if you were in school right now?

12:35.296 --> 12:37.214
Tyler, I get it. Things...

12:38.132 --> 12:41.719
Things have been hard lately,
but... but the goal of this meeting,

12:41.802 --> 12:43.179
the goal for me, anyways,

12:43.262 --> 12:45.139
is to figure out a way
we all can work together

12:45.222 --> 12:46.807
to make things easier on you.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.687
[chuckles] No.
I get what Coach is trying to do.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.355
Okay, fine, whatever.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.401
But just you go, okay?
I don't want Dad there.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.864
Tyler, I know that your father has made
some poor decisions...

13:01.947 --> 13:02.907
[chuckles] Yeah, yeah.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.160
...but he's still your father
and he loves you.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.122
Yeah. Well,
since he's making bad decisions,

13:11.081 --> 13:13.584
maybe he's not the one
who should be telling me how to do better.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.058
Oh, Mrs. Townsend. Come in.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.852
Please, call me Maddie.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.939
Mrs., that doesn't really sit well
with me these days.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.774
[chuckles]
Besides, it makes me feel ancient.

13:37.942 --> 13:38.776
Never.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.111
Uh, please have a seat.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.534
Uh, while we wait for Dr. Townsend?

13:46.992 --> 13:48.160
It's-- It's just gonna be me.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.205
Bill doesn't know about the meeting
at Ty's request.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.958
Bill and Ty haven't exactly
been seeing eye-to-eye these days.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.753
Well, what he's going through,
that's a lot to process when you're 16.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.631
Yeah. It's a whole lot to process
when you're not 16. [chuckles]

14:03.592 --> 14:05.719
Look, uh, Ty's a good kid,

14:06.136 --> 14:09.181
and I feel for him, I do,
but I can't ignore his behavior.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.977
He's got a lousy attitude,
and he's struggling with a dead arm.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.896
He could lose his position
in the starting line-up.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.899
Well, actions have consequences.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.569
I've been drilling that into Ty's head
since he was a bitty thing.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.988
And his grades are down across the board.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.115
If he doesn't get them up,

14:26.991 --> 14:30.286
he could wind up on academic probation
and on the bench.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.955
What do we do?

14:33.038 --> 14:36.917
Well, I think that Ty needs to know
that the adults in his life

14:37.001 --> 14:39.169
are committed to helping him
turn things around.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.130
Yeah, no, a united front
with the same goals.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.007
Yeah. But, pardon my saying so,

14:43.090 --> 14:45.676
that united front should include his dad.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.974
I will speak to Bill.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.393
All right. Like I said, Ty's a good kid.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.437
As far as I'm concerned,
he got a raw deal.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.190
You both did.

15:05.029 --> 15:08.741
I do appreciate
you flying in from Atlanta again, Nolan.

15:08.824 --> 15:12.453
Well, this conversation's too important
to have over the phone, Ms. Decatur.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.914
And I was already on my way
to see the girls.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.583
-It's devastating for them...
-Hmm.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.001
...for everyone who knows...

15:20.002 --> 15:21.629
who knew Rachel and Troy.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.841
Now, I know
that you're the girls' godfather,

15:25.925 --> 15:31.347
but, um, I was a bit surprised
by your guardianship application

15:31.430 --> 15:32.890
given that you're a bachelor.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.560
No hot tub parties and red roses for me.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.939
As a single person myself,
I should know better, so... [chuckles]

15:40.022 --> 15:42.024
How did you become the girls' godfather?

15:42.107 --> 15:43.067
I'm an only child.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.653
Troy was the closest thing I had
to a brother.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.906
Taking on two small girls
is bound to disrupt your lifestyle.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.492
Children and marriage don't have to go
hand-in-hand anymore.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.411
Truth is, I always wanted to be a father,

15:54.495 --> 15:56.580
but my job required frequent travel,

15:56.664 --> 15:59.833
which made relationships difficult.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.502
Well, won't that make parenting tough?

16:01.585 --> 16:04.505
No, ma'am. No, I've reached a level
where I can step back.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.006
Take more of a consulting role.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.092
Well, have you, um...

16:08.759 --> 16:12.262
have you been able to spend much time
with the girls during the years?

16:12.346 --> 16:14.431
Holidays. Vacations.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.477
Two years ago,
we all went to Italy together.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.395
Hmm.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.689
I bet Avery I could eat more gelato
than she could.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.815
-[laughs]
-I lost.

16:22.898 --> 16:23.774
Mm-hmm.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.860
And I spoil 'em rotten
on birthdays and Christmas.

16:26.944 --> 16:30.114
But, as a parent,
I would be sure not to do that.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.031
[laughs]

16:31.115 --> 16:32.658
-Too much.
-All right, yeah,

16:32.741 --> 16:35.411
well, it sounds like they have
a special place in your heart.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.413
-They do.
-Hmm.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.041
I've already found a great dance program
for Addie

16:41.125 --> 16:42.918
and a gymnastics gym for Avery.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
Mm, good. Thanks for being so candid.

16:45.546 --> 16:51.010
I am... I'm hoping that we can
make a decision soon for the girls' sake.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.140
Was there something else?

16:56.765 --> 16:58.183
I was surprised...

16:59.059 --> 17:00.894
to see that Rachel's sister
was a candidate.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.022
Well, Charlotte is their next of kin.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.941
But there was a pretty big rift
over the parents' estate.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.319
Charlotte was all about the money,
nothing else.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.865
So what's going on?

17:12.948 --> 17:15.868
It's Tyler. I had a distressing meeting
with Coach Maddox.

17:17.953 --> 17:18.912
Without me?

17:19.955 --> 17:21.373
Tyler didn't want you there.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.669
His grades are falling in all classes.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.212
Well, that's not like him.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.548
Making sure he has enough time
for his homework?

17:30.215 --> 17:32.801
And Coach Maddox also said
that his pitching is off.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.095
His position in the starting rotation
is at risk.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.722
Well, that's ridiculous.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.974
He's the best pitcher they have,
hands down.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.393
He's struggling, Bill.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.772
Look, the coach thinks
that he is having a hard time

17:44.855 --> 17:46.815
dealing with the current family dynamics.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.108
[chuckles]

17:49.026 --> 17:50.694
Well, ain't that fine.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.030
Y'all had a meeting without me

17:53.113 --> 17:54.990
and decided everything was my fault.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.201
This isn't about placing blame.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.661
I'm asking you to try to help me
to fix things

17:59.745 --> 18:01.663
before our son spins out of control.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.791
Well, he's under your roof, Maddie.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.251
So what would you like me to do?

18:06.335 --> 18:07.836
Pay attention to their feelings.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.172
And not just Tyler. Kyle and Katie, too.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.925
I was swamped on Saturday, Maddie,

18:13.008 --> 18:15.219
and I still made sure
the kids got picked up.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.678
By Noreen?

18:16.762 --> 18:20.641
Can you imagine the look on Katie's face
when she opened the door and she saw...

18:20.724 --> 18:23.352
I was trying to do the right thing.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.230
Come up with another excuse, Bill.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.564
That one's getting old.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.567
[indistinct chatter]

18:30.943 --> 18:32.569
Let's get that sea bass
out to table three.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.737
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.823
Isaac, pass me the vegetables.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.662
[sizzling]

18:43.288 --> 18:45.707
And here I thought
you were just a pastry chef.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.001
Looks like you've been hiding mad skills.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.003
Where do you get your inspiration?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.633
Every dish is a... symphony.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.511
And each ingredient an instrument.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.888
The meat is the bass.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.807
The garlic, violins.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.810
And the vegetables, percussion.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.937
Find a melody that speaks to you.

19:07.020 --> 19:10.440
All right, grilled pork loin up
for table three.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.737
Wow. I've been thinking about
getting my certification.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.447
Where did you go to culinary school?

19:17.531 --> 19:19.825
No. Nothing beats hands-on experience.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.201
Save your money.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.495
Travel. Work with the best.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.206
You know, you'd be amazed
what you can pick up

19:26.290 --> 19:27.332
if you just pay attention.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.542
But you got a degree.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.459
[laughs]

19:29.543 --> 19:31.795
That's because it was a calling,
not a choice.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.215
This job requires self-sacrifice.

19:35.632 --> 19:39.219
It's constant stress, long hours,
and brutal on the body.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.846
Forget about relationships.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.308
Just make sure you love it
before you go into debt for it.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.767
Where'd Dana Sue train?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.687
You'd have to ask her about that.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.231
But I can tell you
the most important thing

19:51.315 --> 19:52.316
I learned for free.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.610
Respect the chain of command.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.321
Dana Sue is head chef. The boss.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.948
Respect her
and how she wants things to be done.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.826
Earn her respect by being excellent.

20:03.785 --> 20:04.953
Now, go be excellent.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.123
[man] I got ten up.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.500
[Erik] Good afternoon, Ms. Decatur.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.002
Good afternoon, Mr. Whitley.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.796
Where is Dana Sue?

20:15.297 --> 20:18.759
Uh, in this short-handed kitchen,
I have many duties.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.178
Tracking Chef is not one of them.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.180
She's at the bar.

20:24.431 --> 20:27.434
So easy. Four little words,
and I'm out of your hair.

20:27.517 --> 20:28.644
[laughs]

20:28.727 --> 20:30.437
You're assuming
that's what I was going for.

20:34.524 --> 20:35.442
[chuckles]

20:35.525 --> 20:36.777
-Uh, Aunt Helen.
-Hmm?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.904
Um, you're helping Addie and Avery?

20:38.987 --> 20:40.364
I'm part of the process, yeah.

20:40.447 --> 20:43.116
Um, could you give them this card from me?

20:43.200 --> 20:45.619
I can't stop thinking
about what they're going through.

20:45.702 --> 20:46.745
Oh, sweetheart.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.082
I'm doing everything I can
to find them a loving home

20:50.165 --> 20:51.917
and to make sure
that they're okay, all right?

20:52.376 --> 20:54.086
You're sweet. Hey, wait.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.755
How well do you know the girls?

20:57.339 --> 21:01.134
Pretty well. I've been babysitting them
since Avery was a toddler.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.346
Did their Aunt Charlotte,
did she babysit them much?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.555
Who?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.267
Never mind. What, uh...

21:09.142 --> 21:11.103
what activities did the girls enjoy doing?

21:11.186 --> 21:14.022
Um, well, Addison's a really good dancer,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.149
and Avery's into gymnastics,

21:16.233 --> 21:18.485
but I honestly think
that's all about the sparkly leotards.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.403
[both laugh]

21:19.486 --> 21:22.948
But what about, like, baking
or stuff like that?

21:23.031 --> 21:25.200
No. I mean, not with me, anyway.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.703
Well, thank you, sweetheart.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.456
I am sure that the girls will be
really happy to get your card.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.006
I didn't know
you were gonna put in a security system.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.633
Well, it was an impulse buy.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.510
But Collins offered me a great deal.

21:43.593 --> 21:44.511
I did.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.138
Should you be up there like that?

21:46.221 --> 21:47.055
You volunteering?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.056
No, sir.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.725
[laughing] No, sir.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.269
I just came by to get your equipment list.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.896
Skeeter needs it
to move forward with the built-ins.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.231
Okay, I-- I'll get to it.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.983
Yeah, and did you get my text?

21:58.066 --> 22:00.902
The landscaper says that
that big old oak out front,

22:00.986 --> 22:02.904
it's got wood rot,
but it's on the city easement

22:02.988 --> 22:04.114
so they have to take it down.

22:04.197 --> 22:07.784
-So all I need you to do is make a ca--
-Helen. I will get to it!

22:08.952 --> 22:10.203
I'll leave you.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.496
[Dana Sue exhales] Thank you.

22:13.749 --> 22:14.624
I got it.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.630
Don't fall, Collins.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.841
If I do, I know who to call.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.387
You come back to lend a hand?
How gracious.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.639
What's going on with Dana Sue?

22:30.140 --> 22:32.351
We're short-handed. She's stressed.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.270
She always takes turnover personally,

22:35.354 --> 22:37.647
but... this is different.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.525
I mean, she's happiest when she's busy,

22:40.609 --> 22:43.070
and... she still has you.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.906
I'll take that as a compliment.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.326
Look, I don't have time
for a chat right now.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.370
If you wanna hang out, grab an apron.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.580
With this manicure?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.168
[laughs]

23:13.934 --> 23:14.893
Are you almost done?

23:15.268 --> 23:17.729
Oh, uh, yeah.
I-- I know, you're anxious to get home.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.565
-No. I actually wanted to talk to you.
-All right, Chef, I'm headed out.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.234
[Isaac]
Anything I can do for you before I go?

23:22.317 --> 23:25.612
Yeah, actually, can you grab me the page
that I just printed from my office?

23:25.946 --> 23:27.531
-Happy to.
-Thank you.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.200
He's a peach.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.917
[printer whirring]

23:59.438 --> 24:00.397
[Dana Sue] Isaac.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.107
[drawer closes]

24:03.024 --> 24:03.900
You get lost?

24:03.984 --> 24:06.445
-Uh, paper jam, but I fixed it.
-Agh.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.531
I really need to replace
that cranky old thing. Thank you.

25:28.902 --> 25:32.239
-Anything else you need right now?
-Just who I was hoping to see.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.950
What can I do for you, Peggy?

25:35.033 --> 25:37.577
I got a call from a friend in Charleston,

25:37.661 --> 25:40.288
a very influential food blogger friend.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.708
He tells me that Brad is no longer
the sous-chef here at Sullivan's.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.377
-Can you run this, please?
-Mm-hmm.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.296
Imagine my shock
at being scooped on a story

25:48.380 --> 25:50.423
brewing in my own back yard.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.593
According to Brad,
he fled the chaos of Sullivan's

25:53.677 --> 25:56.972
and is returning to Charleston
to find a kitchen that's more sane.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.474
You want me to tell you
how much I miss him?

25:59.558 --> 26:02.060
I'm offering you a chance to rebut.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.604
It's my responsibility as deputy editor

26:04.688 --> 26:07.941
to ensure my article
fairly represents both sides.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.443
[blender grinding]

26:14.281 --> 26:15.657
[sizzling]

26:15.740 --> 26:17.576
[man] Now heat that to 275.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.246
[man 2] All right, it's ready.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.500
[Erik] Got a new soup for you to taste.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.878
Gullah peanut and sweet potato.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.965
It's my grandmama's recipe
with a few touches of my own.

26:32.048 --> 26:34.050
Thank you, but stop.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.969
I didn't ask you
to start messing with the menu.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.312
[sighs]

26:45.395 --> 26:46.896
Okay, listen up.

26:48.356 --> 26:51.318
I appreciate everything everyone's doing.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.111
There's a lot going on right now,

26:53.194 --> 26:55.572
and I do not want to make
the wrong decision

26:55.655 --> 26:56.948
because I'm distracted.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.658
I promise

26:59.117 --> 27:00.910
when I find a new sous-chef,

27:00.994 --> 27:03.163
we will all discuss the menu together.

27:03.580 --> 27:04.706
-Okay?
-Yes, Chef.

27:04.789 --> 27:05.665
Back to work.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.376
[man] All right,
you wanna help me with these?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.795
[conversation continues indistinctly]

27:12.255 --> 27:15.508
[Kyle] So, I had some great insight
into Puck last night.

27:15.592 --> 27:19.929
I'm basing him off of period-specific
Welsh and Irish mythological tricksters.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.973
You know, like a chaotic neutral type?

27:22.849 --> 27:23.683
Uh-huh.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.692
You know, if she flutters those eyelashes
any faster, she'll start a hurricane.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.818
[chuckles]

27:41.159 --> 27:42.661
[indistinct chatter]

27:43.787 --> 27:45.330
Incoming. Got my back?

27:45.705 --> 27:48.500
Ooh, sorry, you're on your own.
She kinda scares me.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.922
It's Kyle, right?
You're Ty's little brother.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.132
Yup, I'm the cool one. Obviously.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.884
Aww. Funny, too.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.136
Yeah, you know,
I got all the gifts that count.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.889
All Ty got
was the ridiculous athletic prowess, so...

28:04.140 --> 28:05.600
So, what else is Ty into?

28:06.476 --> 28:08.478
I mean, besides baseball.

28:08.561 --> 28:11.356
Wait, you want dirt on Ty,

28:11.439 --> 28:13.733
and you think I'll spill
because I'm the geeky little brother?

28:13.817 --> 28:15.568
I couldn't possibly
hear any dirt from you.

28:15.652 --> 28:18.154
[chuckles] Everybody knows
I don't talk to freshman boys.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.157
Well, uh... [sighs]

28:22.242 --> 28:24.327
Tyler loves krumping.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.830
Come on. Be serious.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.540
I'm not looking for something bad,

28:28.623 --> 28:30.792
just... something other people don't know.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.044
Okay? And I didn't hear it from you.

28:33.962 --> 28:34.879
Pinky promise.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.095
Um...

28:42.178 --> 28:44.597
Ty takes ballet classes

28:44.681 --> 28:46.558
-to improve flexibility on the mound.
-[chuckles]

28:47.434 --> 28:49.561
Look, seriously,
my mom drives him up to Charleston

28:49.644 --> 28:50.812
every other Saturday.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.689
-[chuckles]
-As long as he doesn't have a game.

28:53.606 --> 28:54.858
That's actually sweet.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.402
Yeah. And, uh, when he was little,

28:57.485 --> 28:59.863
his favorite movie
was High School Musical.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.115
Yeah. That's why he played basketball
in grade school.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.700
You know, his favorite song was the...

29:03.783 --> 29:06.453
♪ G-g-g-g-g-get your head in the game ♪

29:06.536 --> 29:08.788
[both laugh]

29:08.872 --> 29:10.039
[chuckles]

29:31.144 --> 29:32.771
So, this is your mobile office?

29:33.438 --> 29:34.397
Oh.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.400
-Coach Maddox, hi. Um...
-Hi.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.277
I didn't know you worked out at Dexter's.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.070
Call me Cal, please.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.616
You know,
if you're planning a workout regimen,

29:44.699 --> 29:46.785
I'd be more than happy
to share some resources.

29:46.868 --> 29:47.744
Oh. No.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.579
[stammers] I wasn't working out.

29:49.662 --> 29:51.956
Sorry, I didn't mean to overstep.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.875
-No.
-Uh, I will see you later.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.169
No, no, no, no. No, wait, wait.
It's, um...

29:56.628 --> 30:00.089
Well, I wasn't...
Well, I was... working out.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.133
Sort of. But, actually...

30:03.593 --> 30:05.720
Yeah, it's okay.
You can trust me with all your secrets.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.222
[chuckles]

30:07.305 --> 30:08.181
Um...

30:08.264 --> 30:11.643
I was doing a little recon
on gym equipment

30:11.726 --> 30:12.936
for the Corner Spa.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.897
It's, uh, my spa.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.232
I'm one of the co-owners.

30:17.690 --> 30:18.608
Ah.

30:18.691 --> 30:19.943
-Yeah.
-So...

30:20.693 --> 30:22.612
if I keep your secret,

30:23.154 --> 30:25.114
-do I get a discount on a membership?
-[chuckles]

30:25.198 --> 30:26.950
Sorry, it's ladies only.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.119
-Well, that's a real shame.
-Why?

30:31.329 --> 30:33.581
I thought maybe we could
work out together sometime.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.975
Hello. Yes, Chef Dana Sue Sullivan
for Chef John Callin, please.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.602
-Yes, I will hold.
-Mom?

30:55.144 --> 30:56.729
Oh, have a great day, sweetie.

31:00.441 --> 31:03.736
Oh, yes. I'm holding
for Chef John Ca-- Yeah. [laughs]

31:03.820 --> 31:04.654
No problem.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.656
[sighs]

31:07.574 --> 31:09.534
Yeah, no.
I have all the time in the world to hold.

31:09.617 --> 31:10.577
Oh, Uh... He--

31:10.994 --> 31:12.996
Yep, no, I'm still holding. [laughs]

31:13.788 --> 31:14.664
That's fine.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.588
The door's sticking.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.343
What's going on?

31:29.053 --> 31:30.054
Good morning, Chef.

31:30.638 --> 31:31.890
I hope you slept well.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.766
Were you here all night?

31:34.350 --> 31:35.435
Here at Sullivan's,

31:36.019 --> 31:39.731
we pride ourselves
on honoring authenticity and tradition.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.942
So, we are discarding

31:43.526 --> 31:47.196
any dish that may be claimed
by Brad Wellington.

31:48.364 --> 31:52.327
I prepared a foundation
of Dana Sue Sullivan classics,

31:52.785 --> 31:57.999
complemented by two creations...
of my own.

31:58.791 --> 31:59.792
[Dana Sue chuckles]

32:01.753 --> 32:05.965
I hope you will honor me by sampling
and considering them for your new menu.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.179
[sighs]

32:12.597 --> 32:15.433
-Is this your grandmama's soup?
-Yes, Chef.

32:27.695 --> 32:28.655
Well...

32:28.738 --> 32:29.822
[chuckles]

32:31.824 --> 32:33.618
I am an idiot.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.370
I beg your pardon, Chef?

32:35.453 --> 32:37.914
Ugh. I've been stewing in my own blues,

32:37.997 --> 32:42.168
and chasing all over Charleston,
and there is an outstanding sous-chef

32:42.627 --> 32:43.711
right under my nose.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.048
Erik,

32:47.715 --> 32:49.842
the job is yours. If...

32:50.551 --> 32:51.803
you are still willing to put up

32:51.886 --> 32:54.889
with my occasionally
testing your patience.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.933
[laughing]

32:57.934 --> 32:59.268
It would be an honor.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.939
[laughs] Now you're just patronizing me.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.273
Well, absolutely.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.734
My job is to have your back.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.277
No matter what.

Here's the wind-up, it's a...

33:52.780 --> 33:54.657
Aww. Click and a miss.

Oh, no, the duck face will not score.

All right, come on,
get it in, now, get it in!

34:09.589 --> 34:12.884
Oh, you know, uh, Simon told me
to get shots of the game.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.260
-I should go do that.
-Yeah.

34:17.555 --> 34:18.848
[Noreen] Shake it off, sweetie!

34:19.307 --> 34:20.558
You can do it.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.106
Throw strikes, Tyler!

34:27.190 --> 34:28.274
Make 'em swing!

34:29.984 --> 34:31.277
Come on, Ty. Focus.

34:32.987 --> 34:37.033
Come on, son. Nice and loose.
You know what to do, don't overthink it.

-[crowd groans]
-Foul. Foul.

[man] Foul ball!

34:51.589 --> 34:54.258
That's all right, Tyler.
You'll strike him out this time.

[mimicking Noreen]
"This time, Tyler, this time."

34:57.804 --> 34:59.055
[boys laugh]

35:00.014 --> 35:02.058
[man] Let's go, Tyler! Go!

35:03.601 --> 35:04.644
Come on.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.229
[man] Throw a strike, Tyler.

35:06.687 --> 35:07.730
[man 2] That a boy.

35:09.774 --> 35:10.650
[sighs]

35:15.780 --> 35:18.157
All right, come on, cut-off man, hey!
Cut-off man, let's go!

35:18.783 --> 35:21.786
[Cal] Come on, guys, heads up. Heads up.
That's all right.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.162
Let's go, buddy!

35:23.246 --> 35:24.622
[Noreen] You got this one, Tyler.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.091
Hey, come on, Noreen. It's time to go.

35:35.174 --> 35:38.386
-But why?
-Come on. Come on, let's go.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.184
Time.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.111
Ty, listen, I know you got a lot
messing with your head right now,

35:55.194 --> 35:57.572
but you gotta take a deep breath
and try to push it all aside.

35:57.905 --> 35:59.157
You're rushing,

35:59.240 --> 36:02.410
and flying open on your front side.
Just come to the plate a little slower,

36:02.493 --> 36:04.328
and stay a little bit longer
on your back leg.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.747
And then focus and fire.

36:07.832 --> 36:08.791
Thanks, Coach.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.335
And if it helps,

36:12.295 --> 36:14.964
just imagine the face of your nemesis
in the catcher's mitt.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.898
[crowd clapping]

36:31.981 --> 36:33.274

36:36.736 --> 36:37.695
Let's go, Ty.

Strike one!

-That's what I'm talking about!
-Strike two!

36:49.582 --> 36:51.125
[umpire] Strike three! You're out!

36:52.043 --> 36:53.044
[catcher] There you go.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.588
[camera shutter clicks]

36:59.175 --> 37:01.052
-Thanks.
-It was our game, Ty.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.721
Seemed like you were on the ropes,
but you start throwing ched' like crazy.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.140
Too bad it was too late
to pull us out of the hole.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.017
Hit the ball more often
and the hole won't be so deep.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.435
Are you blaming us for the loss?

37:09.977 --> 37:12.146
Nah. Nah, I ain't blaming anybody.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.898
Jackson. Come on, dude, sit down.

37:13.981 --> 37:16.609
Oh, I'm glad to see
that we are demonstrating teamwork

37:16.692 --> 37:18.569
both off and on the field.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.655
[chuckles] You got it, Coach.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.243
[Cal] It was a tough game.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.995
Regionals are still within reach.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.332
You guys have fun.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.459
[boys] Thanks, Coach.

37:33.542 --> 37:36.003
Sorry about the game. Y-- You were great.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.046
Uh...

37:37.129 --> 37:37.964
Thanks.

37:38.464 --> 37:41.342
You like my outfit?
I picked it out special for you.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.135
I'm Sharpay.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.553
High School Musical?

37:45.596 --> 37:47.139
You know, your favorite movie?

37:47.890 --> 37:49.267
-What?
-[laughing]

37:49.725 --> 37:51.686
[boy] Bro, that's your favorite movie?

37:52.395 --> 37:53.813
-[Ty] No.
-[boy 2] That's cute.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.816
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

37:56.899 --> 38:00.194
I'm not embarrassed.
I just... I don't think I've ever seen it.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.488
Well, I think you look really cute, CeCe,

38:02.571 --> 38:04.782
so if Ty's not into it,
you can always role-play with me.

38:04.865 --> 38:06.033

38:07.034 --> 38:08.035
Come on, leave her alone.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.120
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

38:09.787 --> 38:10.830
I'm sorry, I just...

38:11.289 --> 38:13.082
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

38:13.749 --> 38:16.419
So, you don't take ballet either.

38:16.502 --> 38:17.378
[Jackson] Ballet?

38:19.880 --> 38:20.923
No, no, he takes ballet.

38:21.757 --> 38:22.925
That's just great.

38:23.384 --> 38:24.760
[Jackson] All this time and we never knew

38:24.844 --> 38:27.305
that you've just been sneaking off
to ballet, buddy.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.514
[boy] Shut up, bro.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.101
You guys, come on.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.185
Shut up, man.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.312
Yeah, I'll be back.

38:36.355 --> 38:38.065
I think he should be brown, right?

38:40.776 --> 38:42.361
-Make him a little--
-Hey, guys.

38:42.903 --> 38:43.946
Is this seat taken?

38:44.030 --> 38:45.072
[Katie] Sit with us, Coach!

38:46.115 --> 38:47.491
I don't want Kyle to come back

38:47.575 --> 38:50.453
because he always eats the pepperoni
off my pizza.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.997
Oh, well, I assure you,

38:53.080 --> 38:55.750
-I am no pepperoni thief.
-Good.

38:57.918 --> 39:00.296
Since I don't have to protect
my pepperoni,

39:00.379 --> 39:01.839
can I go play in the arcade?

39:02.423 --> 39:05.259
You know what, sweetie,
I don't know that I have any quarters.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.136
Oh, I always have quarters. Let me look.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.556
Yeah. Here you go.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.767
-Knock yourself out.
-Hey, what do you say?

39:13.184 --> 39:15.436
-Thank you, Coach.
-You're welcome.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.482
Sorry about the game.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.818
There are more lessons in losses
than wins.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.946
Well, you got through to Bill in one look

39:26.030 --> 39:28.324
better than I can
in an entire conversation.

39:29.283 --> 39:30.910
Might need a lesson in that. [chuckles]

39:31.911 --> 39:33.371
Well, you play your cards right.

39:33.996 --> 39:35.414

40:06.028 --> 40:07.571
It's no big deal. Really.

40:07.655 --> 40:08.614
It's a big deal to me,

40:08.697 --> 40:10.950
and you should know
it was all your brother's fault.

40:11.033 --> 40:11.909
What?

40:11.992 --> 40:14.995
You know, he's probably acting out
because of all the crap with your dad.

40:15.079 --> 40:18.290
I'm sure it's hard on you guys
since everybody knows.

40:18.874 --> 40:20.167
I totally get it.

Ms. Decatur, I can't thank you enough
for all your hard work and assistance.

I am so grateful.

40:42.898 --> 40:46.110
I do hope that this next chapter
will be a happy one for you all.

If you had told me a year ago
that I'd be raising two amazing girls,

I wouldn't have believed it.

40:55.828 --> 40:59.457
'Cause I didn't want to admit how much
I wanted to be a dad.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.795
I'd give anything
to have Troy and Rachel back.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.132
But they have left me such a gift.

I, uh, I've got a call to make.

41:22.813 --> 41:23.731
Sure.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.070

41:34.575 --> 41:36.076
Uh-uh. No more of this.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.995
This is my kitchen now.

What in God's green earth
are you going on about, Erik Whitley?

41:42.333 --> 41:46.337
In this kitchen,
all gifts are welcomed and appreciated.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.590
More importantly,
all gifts are put to use.

I do not work for free.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.155
Oh.

42:13.239 --> 42:16.242
So, maybe we can set up
a little, uh, barter system

42:16.325 --> 42:18.619
in exchange
for some of your chicken pot pies.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.372
-I think we can make that work.
-Okay.

42:23.165 --> 42:26.335
Well, then, lead me to your sink.

42:31.423 --> 42:33.175
So I hear you like to play games.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.928
Good sir, I am a man of the arts.

42:36.011 --> 42:40.182
Ah. So you don't play games.
You, uh, play jokes, right?

42:41.350 --> 42:42.726

42:42.810 --> 42:44.728

you're telling the truth when you're not?

and love High School Musical?

Uh... [chuckles]

-[chuckles, stammers]

43:32.526 --> 43:34.361
What happens to me
if something happens to you?

43:34.445 --> 43:36.447
Well, nothing's gonna happen to me--

43:39.074 --> 43:40.743
That's what the Calhouns thought.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.540
I know that...

43:47.958 --> 43:50.919
bad things happen, sweetheart, and...

43:53.672 --> 43:59.803
I think the important thing to remember
is that you can't let fear...

44:05.434 --> 44:07.061
And no matter what,

through a goose in this town.

that you two were awfully cozy.

to run into Cal there.

like that.
