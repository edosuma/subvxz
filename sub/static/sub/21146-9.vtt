00:51.136 --> 00:54.973
Jesse, much bigger things
are coming for you.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.808
Much bigger things than this here.

00:58.435 --> 01:01.688
So, you gotta be one of the good guys.
'Cause why?

01:01.980 --> 01:03.940
'Cause there's way too many of the bad.

01:04.441 --> 01:05.442
You promise me?

01:05.817 --> 01:07.819
I promise, Daddy.

01:08.695 --> 01:12.490
You stop that.
We Custers don't cry.

01:13.658 --> 01:14.743
We fight.

01:14.826 --> 01:18.246
I did this, Daddy, I prayed for this!
It's all my fault!

01:29.549 --> 01:32.594
<i>Let me out! Please!</i>

01:32.677 --> 01:34.596
<i>Let me out!</i>

01:35.805 --> 01:37.807
<i>Let me out! Let me out!</i>

02:00.538 --> 02:02.749
<i>It wasn't like I was out there looking for God.</i>

02:02.832 --> 02:03.792
<i>I mean, I'm not a nutjob.</i>

02:03.875 --> 02:07.253
<i>Right? It was a normal Sunday,
and I always eat toast on Sunday.</i>

02:07.337 --> 02:10.131
<i>I mean, sometimes bagels but usually toast.</i>

02:10.215 --> 02:11.508
<i>So, anyway, this Sunday,</i>

02:11.591 --> 02:14.677
<i>I was just about to put strawberry jam
on my toast when I...</i>

02:14.761 --> 02:17.055
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.182
<i>...see this face right here
in the toast and it hits me.</i>

02:19.265 --> 02:21.059
<i>I mean, God's freaking face.</i>

02:21.142 --> 02:23.144
The Dork Docs not pan out?

02:24.729 --> 02:26.564
No.

02:28.399 --> 02:29.859
Some good stuff here.

02:31.444 --> 02:32.529
Maybe.

02:39.953 --> 02:41.329
You know, Denis is feeling better.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.501
- Denis?
- Yeah, Denis.

02:47.919 --> 02:50.463
He's gettin' a nice little glow
back in his cheeks.

02:50.547 --> 02:52.131
I think he's gonna make it.

02:52.841 --> 02:54.926
- That's great, Cass.
- Yeah.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.929
Looks like we didn't need your help after all.

03:03.643 --> 03:05.395
What, are we looking for God
on YouTube, now?

03:06.104 --> 03:07.230
Is that what it's come to?

03:07.647 --> 03:10.400
God is missing, Cass.
It's important.

03:12.318 --> 03:15.446
Without God, there's no structure. No order.

03:16.114 --> 03:18.700
With no one at the wheel,
we hit the rocks and it's chaos.

03:18.783 --> 03:20.577
There has to be someone in charge.

03:21.661 --> 03:23.371
Now, without God we have...

03:26.332 --> 03:27.333
Without God...

03:31.421 --> 03:32.422
It's getting there.

03:34.841 --> 03:36.259
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.636
- What...
- Don't say it, Jesse.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.680
Don't say it.

03:45.935 --> 03:46.978
Hey, can I get one of those?

03:47.061 --> 03:49.397
Yeah. Sure.

03:54.861 --> 03:57.238
Yes, so, I took three from a.44.

03:58.489 --> 04:00.325
But you know what?

04:00.825 --> 04:02.577
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.539
Tulip, love, maybe you should
give that place a rest.

04:06.623 --> 04:09.167
I got it. We're good.

04:11.252 --> 04:14.422
You hear that, Cass.
He's got it. We're good.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.762
So, what are you boys doing, huh?

04:20.845 --> 04:23.014
- Babe, I know you don't wanna hear this...
- Jesse.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.266
- We've been over this.
- You really, really need to get to...

04:25.350 --> 04:28.102
I'm not going to sleep, okay?

04:32.315 --> 04:33.316
Hey.

04:35.735 --> 04:37.153
Hey.

04:37.695 --> 04:38.696
Sleep.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.045
- She was tired.
- Yeah.

05:05.807 --> 05:07.475
<i>Sleep.</i>

05:07.558 --> 05:11.187
There, sir, you see?
That's the power I've been talking about.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.816
He just said "Go to sleep,"
and she went to sleep, just like that.

05:14.899 --> 05:17.235
People do whatever he says.
What do you think?

05:21.906 --> 05:24.617
I think I'm bored.

05:26.119 --> 05:29.122
What kind of a world is it
when a woman obeying a man

05:29.205 --> 05:31.416
is seen as a superpower?

05:35.211 --> 05:39.048
I have a date.
Kill them all.

06:19.797 --> 06:22.216
Lord, I call upon You to strengthen us,

06:22.300 --> 06:24.260
light our way through the darkness,

06:24.343 --> 06:26.804
and protect us in this holy mission.

06:26.888 --> 06:27.930
- Amen.
- Amen.

06:28.014 --> 06:29.015
Amen.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.605
Love you, man.

06:36.814 --> 06:39.192
Right, approaching target.
Make your weapons hot.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.490
Helmets on.

06:51.621 --> 06:52.663
Go on silent.

06:59.212 --> 07:00.671
<i>All right, we're here.</i>

07:01.005 --> 07:02.423
Night vision.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.931
<i>Go, go, go. Move, move.</i>

07:22.693 --> 07:26.197
<i>Gate's locked.
I'm gonna blow it.</i>

07:34.413 --> 07:35.790
<i>Quad, clear.</i>

07:37.208 --> 07:38.709
<i>Walkways, clear.</i>

07:47.385 --> 07:48.886
<i>Approaching entry way.</i>

07:49.929 --> 07:51.389
<i>Proceed to second level.</i>

08:18.457 --> 08:19.458
<i>Damn it.</i>

08:21.502 --> 08:22.503
<i>Hold.</i>

08:35.224 --> 08:36.225
<i>Are we good?</i>

08:38.102 --> 08:39.645
<i>Yeah, we're good.</i>

08:55.995 --> 08:58.456
<i>It's Custer. Go, go, go!</i>

09:02.710 --> 09:03.878
<i>Get him off me!</i>

09:03.961 --> 09:06.547
<i>- Stay down.
- Oh, God! Get him off me!</i>

09:07.465 --> 09:08.674
<i>Get him off me!</i>

09:09.175 --> 09:11.302
<i>He bit me! He bit me!</i>

09:16.015 --> 09:19.352
<i>- Disarm! Disarm him! Come on, hold.
- Don't do that!</i>

09:44.293 --> 09:46.629
<i>The old man's been eliminated.</i>

09:53.386 --> 09:54.637
<i>Eyes on the woman.</i>

10:14.407 --> 10:15.533
Kill your...

10:17.285 --> 10:18.577
Kill your friends.

10:31.716 --> 10:32.925
Hey.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.054
Hey, hey, wait. Don't.

10:37.138 --> 10:39.307
What're you doing?
Please, don't.

10:39.390 --> 10:40.433
I'm sorry.

10:44.729 --> 10:46.564
Men in white.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.401
Drop it. Come here.

10:54.155 --> 10:55.698
First, you gotta answer some questions.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.286
Wait!

11:26.771 --> 11:27.938
This is nice.

11:29.732 --> 11:32.151
And they opened it just for you.

11:34.779 --> 11:37.740
My father told me
you were very important.

11:39.784 --> 11:42.578
- Right?
- Is what right?

11:42.787 --> 11:44.705
That you're important. Your job.

11:44.789 --> 11:46.791
Yes. I suppose that's true.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.585
You're not satisfied with it?

11:50.127 --> 11:53.631
I work for the most powerful
organization in the world.

11:53.714 --> 11:57.385
Agents in 113 countries
ready to do my bidding

11:57.468 --> 11:59.095
at a moment's notice.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.388
Impressive.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.307
And yet?

12:04.934 --> 12:06.352
And yet...

12:09.230 --> 12:12.817
And yet, I have been feeling a little

12:14.568 --> 12:16.445
disenchanted lately.

12:16.987 --> 12:17.988
Hmm.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.826
I was like you once.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.953
Looking for a sense of purpose and meaning.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.289
On the surface, I had it all,

12:28.666 --> 12:31.669
but my life was like a jigsaw puzzle
with one missing piece.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.587
One vital piece.

12:34.672 --> 12:37.341
I traveled. Volunteered.

12:39.135 --> 12:42.638
And then one night,
in a hospital in the inner city,

12:43.597 --> 12:45.141
Stephen walked into my life.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.894
He's eight years old,
tears in his eyes.

12:49.478 --> 12:52.857
His mama was a crack addict,
his daddy was a deadbeat.

12:53.190 --> 12:56.026
And he was developmentally challenged.

12:56.110 --> 12:58.696
For months, all I saw was his tears.

12:59.947 --> 13:04.785
But then one day, I reached into my bag,
and I gave him a chocolate,

13:04.869 --> 13:06.495
just one chocolate,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.248
and that's when it happened.

13:11.417 --> 13:13.752
He smiled.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.713
For the first time.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.924
A simple act of kindness
had changed his life,

13:19.049 --> 13:21.969
and that beautiful smile
was my missing puzzle piece.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.349
The smile of an indigent half-wit?

13:28.726 --> 13:30.686
That was your puzzle piece?

13:30.936 --> 13:33.230
You understand they smile
all the time, right?

13:37.735 --> 13:40.654
Your father is
the Governor of Louisiana, yes?

13:41.906 --> 13:42.948
Hmm.

13:43.157 --> 13:44.742
Has he ever been to Angola?

13:46.577 --> 13:48.662
The country, or the prison?

13:50.706 --> 13:51.916
Either.

13:54.043 --> 13:55.044
Stand up.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.426
Remove your shirt.

14:10.768 --> 14:12.520
Hold the butter in your hand.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.858
Not the tray. The butter.

14:17.942 --> 14:19.944
Take it in your hand.

14:24.782 --> 14:26.575
Tuck it under your chin.

14:27.535 --> 14:30.246
- Tuck...
- It under your chin.

14:36.377 --> 14:38.420
Now, listen carefully.

14:38.504 --> 14:42.633
In the general ballpark,
how long can you hold your breath?

14:53.018 --> 14:54.019
Never mind.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.419
- I love you.
- Shut up, Hoover.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.675
I was supposed to be
in Ulan Bator tomorrow.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.178
Now, because of your incompetence...

15:29.263 --> 15:30.389
Who's first?

15:30.472 --> 15:32.850
- He is.
- I am.

15:34.518 --> 15:35.519
On the tarp.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.946
You're absolutely
right to be disappointed, sir.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.323
We deserve to be put down.

15:49.658 --> 15:52.661
Let me say, what an honor it's been
to serve the organization.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.706
- Our sacred mission is...
- Damn it.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.042
Sir, may I?
The GLOCK has a tendency to jam.

16:00.836 --> 16:04.715
Let me just...
I assume you'll try to kill Custer again.

16:05.049 --> 16:06.050
Immediately.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.636
May I ask which method?

16:08.719 --> 16:11.555
Gas leak. Oven fire. Junkie break in.

16:11.722 --> 16:12.890
If I may be so bold...

16:13.724 --> 16:16.685
Custer just took out
six Samson operatives. Easily.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.729
Have you had a chance to look at his file?

16:20.147 --> 16:22.441
He poses a direct threat to the Holy Child.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.234
We cannot underestimate him.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.154
What would you suggest?

16:27.237 --> 16:30.157
A target like this?
We should activate B.R.A.D.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.661
You don't think that's overkill?

16:35.245 --> 16:38.123
I think it's just the right amount of kill.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.671
- What is your name again?
- Featherstone, sir.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.839
We met at the conference
in Paris last year.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.258
And the weapons lecture in Budapest,
and this morning.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.055
It will take time to activate B.R.A.D.

16:53.138 --> 16:56.934
Meanwhile, I have a rape fantasy.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.561
Oh. Absolutely, sir.

16:59.645 --> 17:02.189
- I'll put on a miniskirt and some lipstick...
- Not you.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.108
I want a professional.

17:04.483 --> 17:05.526
Oh.

17:05.609 --> 17:08.320
Something rough. Ready. Cruel.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.572
- One of those no-means-yes things, sir?
- Exactly.

17:10.823 --> 17:11.990
We're on it.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.367
I'll contact B.R.A.D.,

17:13.450 --> 17:15.202
Hoover here
will take care of the professional.

17:16.495 --> 17:17.621
Thank you, sir.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.919
I'm going to leave the tarp out.

17:24.002 --> 17:27.339
If you fail again, it'll be waiting.

18:43.707 --> 18:47.377
It doesn't make sense.
How can that be?

18:49.046 --> 18:51.840
Their fingerprints are not in the system.
You sure?

18:51.924 --> 18:53.592
No prints, no IDs, nothing.

18:53.717 --> 18:54.927
- These guys are ghosts.
- All right.

18:55.010 --> 18:57.054
Well, keep me posted if you find anything.

18:57.137 --> 19:00.098
For now, take out the bodies.
You guys set up a perimeter.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.558
Sarge, what the hell's going on?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.101
We work for him now.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.394
You work for me now.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.480
Yes, sir. I work for you now.

19:06.563 --> 19:09.900
All right, give me that.
Let's go. One sec.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.613
Sarge, get a cleaner for this.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.615
Yes, sir.
I'll call the cleaner now.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.493
What the hell happened?

19:19.576 --> 19:21.745
Middle of the night,
these men came here to kill us.

19:21.829 --> 19:23.664
- What?
- They're not going to stop.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.457
Next time, there'll be more, coming soon.

19:25.541 --> 19:29.795
But this time, we'll be ready for them.
Good morning.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.092
'Morning.

19:50.107 --> 19:51.441
<i>Station one, clear.</i>

19:53.110 --> 19:54.319
<i>Station two, clear.</i>

19:55.737 --> 19:56.738
<i>Station three, clear.</i>

19:58.031 --> 19:59.783
<i>Station four, clear.</i>

20:00.826 --> 20:01.869
Five, clear.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.580
<i>No sign of anyone, yet.</i>

20:05.455 --> 20:07.291
Keep your eyes open.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.465
B.R.A.D.'s in transit, sir.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.134
<i>And the other thing?</i>

20:17.217 --> 20:19.303
Hoover is researching
professionals as we speak.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.387
Good.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.307
I was thinking
you might prefer multiple prostitutes?

20:24.975 --> 20:26.727
- Yes, that's fine.
<i>- Good.</i>

20:26.810 --> 20:29.563
No-means-yes in multiples.
Thank you, sir.

20:44.328 --> 20:45.829
Cats.

20:47.164 --> 20:49.166
No. No.

20:52.336 --> 20:53.921
No. No.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.339
No. No.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.425
Hmm.

21:03.764 --> 21:07.017
<i>So, it looks
like we didn't need your help after all.</i>

21:11.688 --> 21:14.191
<i>What,
are we looking for God on YouTube, now?</i>

21:14.274 --> 21:16.818
<i>Is that what it's come to?</i>

21:16.902 --> 21:20.572
<i>God is missing, Cass. It's important.</i>

21:21.448 --> 21:22.950
<i>Without God, there's no structure.</i>

21:24.368 --> 21:26.203
<i>No order.</i>

21:28.038 --> 21:29.373
<i>Without someone at the wheel,</i>

21:29.456 --> 21:32.000
<i>we hit the rocks, it's just chaos.</i>

21:32.084 --> 21:35.754
<i>There has to be someone in charge.
You see, without God we...</i>

21:45.889 --> 21:47.099
Hmm...

22:48.618 --> 22:49.953
Thank you.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.173
Thank you.

23:02.049 --> 23:05.510
No. "Thank you, Papa."

23:08.263 --> 23:09.264
Thank you.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.267
Thank you.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.147
All right. Hang on.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.733
Over here.
Let me see it. Okay.

23:21.485 --> 23:24.237
Now, see,
you've gotta be careful, now, all right?

23:24.946 --> 23:29.326
The sun's bad.
Sun's very, very bad. Do you understand?

23:29.951 --> 23:34.164
Yeah? Come here. Drink this.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.707
It'll help you heal.

23:35.791 --> 23:38.168
That's the only time you drink it, though.
Do you understand me now?

23:39.169 --> 23:42.047
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait, you lunatic.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.716
Cheers.

23:49.137 --> 23:52.599
No, no, no. Slow...
Slow down. Don't...

23:53.016 --> 23:54.226
- Hey...
- Hmm.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.478
Slow down, all right?

23:56.561 --> 23:58.355
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:58.855 --> 23:59.940
- Hey.
- Denis.

24:00.941 --> 24:01.942
Interrupting?

24:02.526 --> 24:03.902
No, no. You're all right.

24:03.985 --> 24:05.695
Denis, go on, give us a minute.

24:06.363 --> 24:08.990
There's a good lad.
Slow on that.

24:20.252 --> 24:22.712
I'm glad he's doing better.

24:25.298 --> 24:29.511
What you did there...
Why didn't you tell me about it?

24:30.887 --> 24:33.056
Would you have been cool about it?

24:35.225 --> 24:36.309
Of course, I would.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.939
Maybe next time, then, eh?

24:43.942 --> 24:45.360
They're coming back.

24:46.528 --> 24:49.030
The men in white.
I don't know how, but they're coming back.

24:49.573 --> 24:50.782
I've set 20 cops in a perimeter,

24:50.866 --> 24:52.325
so no one's getting in without us knowing.

24:53.076 --> 24:56.955
We're gonna get answers, Cass.
I just need one of 'em alive.

24:59.124 --> 25:01.001
When are they coming back, do you think?

25:01.084 --> 25:03.628
Well, they have resources, obviously.

25:03.712 --> 25:07.424
They want me pretty bad.
I'd put money on them coming back tonight.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.136
All right.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.762
You gonna be ready?

25:14.764 --> 25:16.308
I only got half an intestine,

25:17.350 --> 25:19.269
missing me bloody liver,

25:19.644 --> 25:22.314
but I got me meds.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.900
So, I'll do me best, all right?

25:26.109 --> 25:27.444
All right.

25:28.445 --> 25:31.156
- Good man.
- Padre?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.619
I'm not the one
we need to be worried about.

25:43.835 --> 25:46.421
You remember Ixtapa?

25:48.298 --> 25:51.301
Back when we were still on the run
from the Rodriguez Brothers?

25:53.887 --> 25:55.805
You had that bad earache.

25:58.350 --> 26:02.020
It must've been for, what? Weeks.

26:05.649 --> 26:08.443
Going from crappy small town
doctor to doctor?

26:10.237 --> 26:11.905
You were in agony.

26:14.199 --> 26:16.326
That pain just wouldn't go away.

26:22.249 --> 26:24.960
Then Teddy Rodriguez shows up
with his crew. It must've been...

26:27.003 --> 26:28.296
Fifteen to two.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.800
But we fought them.

26:32.300 --> 26:35.679
Teddy, Nunes,

26:37.013 --> 26:39.182
that albino with the teeth, remember?

26:41.434 --> 26:44.938
We ran them off,
and we got the hell out of there.

26:46.481 --> 26:49.484
Must've been about an hour later,
way up the road,

26:51.611 --> 26:55.532
you suddenly realized
the earache had gone.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.370
Couldn't feel that pain no more.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.129
No more running out at night, Tulip.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.591
No more bulletproof vests.

27:15.385 --> 27:16.720
This is what you need.

27:18.263 --> 27:19.264
A fight.

27:21.099 --> 27:23.226
You used the Word on me.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.360
I didn't know what else to do.

27:36.406 --> 27:37.574
I was so worried.

27:39.159 --> 27:40.702
You slept, though, right?

27:46.458 --> 27:47.709
Did you dream?

27:57.594 --> 27:59.804
Maybe you should sit this one out.

28:00.263 --> 28:03.558
You know, check into a hotel,
put your feet up,

28:05.101 --> 28:07.020
me and Cass will deal with this.

28:11.983 --> 28:14.152
Oh, Jesse...

28:21.493 --> 28:23.328
I'm gonna need a gun.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.042
Rough and ready, yes.

28:29.584 --> 28:31.961
We need more than one. Great.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.838
- Do you take credit card?
- No means yes.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.175
Is Corporate Card okay?

28:44.933 --> 28:46.768
Yeah, 601...

28:49.145 --> 28:50.146
Hey, uh,

28:51.564 --> 28:53.983
I know we just met,
but I really need to borrow your gun.

28:55.151 --> 28:59.239
I can't tell you why,
and everything's cool. I mean, I'm cool.

28:59.322 --> 29:01.825
- I just need a gun.
- Are you okay?

29:02.951 --> 29:04.160
I mean, what's going on?

29:06.830 --> 29:09.124
Well, I can't say.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.128
Okay, okay. Just a sec.

29:24.514 --> 29:25.557
Here you go.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.103
Thanks.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.522
Let me know if you need help.

29:40.447 --> 29:42.782
- Why'd you give her the gun?
- She asked.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.909
Yeah, but now, she's armed.

29:46.327 --> 29:49.122
A gun's not gonna stop B.R.A.D.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.227
<i>Cleaner's here.</i>

30:14.189 --> 30:15.940
- Send him up.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

30:17.984 --> 30:20.528
- Still nothing?
<i>- Nope. All clear.</i>

30:53.770 --> 30:54.979
Anything?

30:55.063 --> 30:56.523
Not yet.

30:56.606 --> 30:58.024
Who's the guy in the kitchen?

30:58.107 --> 30:59.526
He's just a cleaner.

30:59.609 --> 31:02.987
Oh, okay, just the cleaner.

31:03.071 --> 31:06.282
He's the cleaning machine
who's cleaning things, okay.

31:06.366 --> 31:08.034
- You all right?
- Yup.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.790
Ready? Could be any minute.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.250
Yeah.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.752
I'm ready when you are, Padre.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.095
<i>Station one, clear.</i>

31:28.846 --> 31:31.891
<i>Station two, clear.</i>

31:31.975 --> 31:33.059
<i>Station three, clear.</i>

31:34.352 --> 31:35.853
<i>Station four, clear.</i>

31:36.145 --> 31:38.022
<i>Five, clear.</i>

31:38.106 --> 31:39.607
Where are they?

31:42.819 --> 31:43.861
Hey!

31:48.324 --> 31:51.452
Hey! Turn that down!

31:53.663 --> 31:55.456
Does he know what's coming?

31:55.540 --> 31:56.749
Yeah, I'm sorry, Padre.

31:56.833 --> 31:58.918
I'll tell him to turn it down.

32:04.841 --> 32:06.259
What is it?

32:06.384 --> 32:07.719
Shit.

32:12.807 --> 32:15.852
What is it?

32:15.935 --> 32:17.312
Never mind.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.611
<i>Station one, clear.</i>

32:26.070 --> 32:29.032
<i>Station two, clear.</i>

32:29.115 --> 32:30.199
<i>Station three, clear.</i>

32:31.451 --> 32:32.952
<i>Station four, clear.</i>

32:33.870 --> 32:34.871
<i>Station five?</i>

32:36.039 --> 32:37.790
All clear.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.881
<i>I got someone heading west.</i>

32:44.964 --> 32:46.382
<i>Anyone else see him?</i>

32:47.675 --> 32:48.676
See who?

32:49.552 --> 32:51.220
<i>Shit. I lost him.</i>

32:57.060 --> 32:59.228
Damn it!

32:59.729 --> 33:01.189
Step away from the car, you...

33:08.821 --> 33:10.365
Son of a bitch!

33:13.076 --> 33:14.452
Hey!

33:19.957 --> 33:22.877
<i>10-00!
Officer down! Officer down!</i>

33:26.089 --> 33:27.215
What is it?

33:29.759 --> 33:30.760
What's going on?

33:35.014 --> 33:36.432
Hey!

33:37.475 --> 33:38.768
Hey!

33:39.686 --> 33:41.354
Turn it down!

33:43.731 --> 33:44.774
How dare you!

33:45.566 --> 33:46.818
Denis!

33:48.861 --> 33:49.987
Turn that music down!

33:50.071 --> 33:51.197
I can't hear you.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.366
How many are there?

33:54.867 --> 33:55.910
Huh?

33:56.452 --> 33:57.537
Cass!

33:58.287 --> 34:00.123
Cass, they're here! Let's go.

34:02.583 --> 34:05.044
- Jesse, I gotta...
- They're here. Let's go.

34:07.630 --> 34:10.174
Don't shoot!
I need one alive!

34:18.599 --> 34:20.184
What did you do that for?

34:20.268 --> 34:22.729
He's one of them, Jesse.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

34:22.812 --> 34:24.605
See? He's got a gun.

34:29.152 --> 34:32.029
No, no, no.
I swear I saw a gun.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.783
- It was in his hand.
- You could've killed me, you crazy bitch!

34:36.868 --> 34:39.829
- I thought it was...
- It's all right. It's all right.

34:39.912 --> 34:41.664
Kind of looks like a gun, doesn't it?

34:45.835 --> 34:47.003
<i>It's all clear.</i>

34:49.964 --> 34:51.924
It's all clear. It's just some drunk.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.343
I repeat, it's all clear.

34:59.849 --> 35:01.309
Okay.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.313
I'm gonna go keep a look out.

35:07.023 --> 35:10.359
Yes, good idea. We'll, uh...

35:12.028 --> 35:13.321
Clean up the cleaner.

35:16.407 --> 35:19.243
We're gonna need an ambulance up here.
We've had an accident.

35:19.619 --> 35:20.953
<i>Copy that.</i>

35:21.037 --> 35:22.038
What now?

35:23.956 --> 35:25.708
Something's coming, Cass.
I'm telling you.

35:26.626 --> 35:27.877
It's not over.

35:28.795 --> 35:32.215
Great. Tulip'll be thrilled.

35:35.259 --> 35:36.886
And tell him to turn that music down!

35:38.846 --> 35:40.473
Yeah, turn the music down.

35:41.390 --> 35:42.892
That'll help.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.041
How long until impact?

36:07.875 --> 36:09.377
Twenty-three minutes.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.129
Shouldn't we, um, evacuate?

36:12.755 --> 36:15.091
B.R.A.D. is the pinnacle
of Grail precise engineering.

36:15.758 --> 36:17.176
I want to be here to see it hit.

36:17.260 --> 36:19.262
What about the possibility of error?

36:22.306 --> 36:24.016
Then what could be more noble

36:24.600 --> 36:28.604
than sacrificing ourselves
for the greater glory of The Cause?

36:29.272 --> 36:30.273
Yeah.

36:32.108 --> 36:33.276
Totally.

36:55.590 --> 36:57.383
Can I help you?

36:57.466 --> 36:58.634
Durando, who are these...

36:58.718 --> 36:59.844
Shut up, asshole.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.846
Your receptionist's gone home
for the night.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.223
Do you know who I am?

37:04.891 --> 37:08.144
Yeah, for the next 20 minutes,
you're garbage.

37:09.562 --> 37:11.230
Who are you?

37:12.064 --> 37:13.983
We're the professionals.

37:16.652 --> 37:19.906
I see a mistake has been made.

37:20.364 --> 37:21.657
I wanted women.

37:21.741 --> 37:24.243
I will compensate you for your time,

37:24.327 --> 37:26.162
but I must show you the door.

37:26.704 --> 37:29.040
No, no, no.
We're gonna show you the door.

37:29.832 --> 37:31.584
Mmm. The back door.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.961
No, that's not what I want.

37:34.045 --> 37:36.088
You heard the signal, boys.
No means yes.

37:36.172 --> 37:38.132
- Wait. No. No.
- Showtime.

37:41.177 --> 37:42.470
Shit.

37:54.065 --> 37:57.234
The missing puzzle piece.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.788
Hello, sir.
Happy to inform you that B.R.A.D. is...

38:08.871 --> 38:10.873
Call it off. Immediately.

38:11.207 --> 38:12.249
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

38:12.333 --> 38:13.709
May I ask why?

38:14.043 --> 38:15.586
No, you may not.

38:15.670 --> 38:17.046
<i>Consider it done, sir.</i>

38:19.256 --> 38:21.050
Call off the missile.

38:21.509 --> 38:23.302
- It's already been launched.
- Then redirect it.

38:23.386 --> 38:24.428
Where... I...

38:25.888 --> 38:26.889
What do we do?

38:27.473 --> 38:29.600
- Where do we send it?
- Move.

38:41.904 --> 38:45.324
No. Do not like cats.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.249
Hurry! Hurry!

39:28.117 --> 39:29.744
What was the target?

39:29.827 --> 39:32.121
Harry Connick Jr.'s house.

39:33.664 --> 39:34.874
Good work.

39:39.170 --> 39:40.629
<i>Station one, clear.</i>

39:41.255 --> 39:42.840
<i>Station two, still clear.</i>

39:43.466 --> 39:44.967
<i>Station three, clear.</i>

39:45.301 --> 39:47.303
<i>Station four, still clear.</i>

39:54.143 --> 39:55.227
You can go.

39:55.561 --> 39:58.314
<i>Hear that, boys?
We can go.</i>

40:00.232 --> 40:01.776
Forget this ever happened.

40:09.325 --> 40:11.243
<i>The Armenians are at it again.</i>

40:11.327 --> 40:13.245
<i>Local officials are blaming
the terrorist group</i>

40:13.329 --> 40:17.083
<i>for that shocking drone attack
on Harry Connick Jr.'s house.</i>

40:17.166 --> 40:21.337
<i>This one goes out to the singer,
actor, and talk show host</i>

40:21.420 --> 40:23.506
<i>dead at 49.</i>

40:32.389 --> 40:35.226
- I'll have what he's having.
- Sure.

40:43.109 --> 40:44.568
You like my suit?

40:45.694 --> 40:48.531
It was handmade by a Hungarian humpback.

40:49.615 --> 40:53.285
A real craftswoman.
Excellent attention to detail.

40:53.994 --> 40:58.082
A quality sorely lacking
in this modern world of ours.

41:10.302 --> 41:11.762
I came alone.

41:14.557 --> 41:16.058
Who are you?

41:16.892 --> 41:18.394
I'm <i>Herr</i> Starr.

41:18.811 --> 41:21.397
I hear you've been looking for God, Preacher.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.817
Perhaps, I can help?
