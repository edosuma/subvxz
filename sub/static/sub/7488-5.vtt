00:47.980 --> 00:51.080
Pah!

00:53.010 --> 00:56.020
Oh. Pants sundae.

00:57.150 --> 00:58.950
Oh.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.760
Mmm.

01:05.790 --> 01:08.030
I can't believe this
is on the Internet.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.700
I thought I was alone.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.830
Austin, you know there's
no eating in the store.

01:11.870 --> 01:15.740
And there's definitely no
eating off your pants.

01:16.740 --> 01:17.940
There's no sign for that.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.840
There shouldn't
have to be a sign.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.880
To not eat off your pants.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.850
Guess who got a job at
pirate Frank's fish fry.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.880
Where every meal is a parrrr-ty.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.050
This is the worst
job I've ever had.

01:33.090 --> 01:35.090
I smell like fish guts.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.860
And guess who my
new coworker is.

01:36.890 --> 01:37.960
Ahoy, mateys!

01:37.990 --> 01:40.730
I just got hired
at pirate Frank's,

01:40.760 --> 01:42.830
Where every meal is a parrrr-ty.

01:42.860 --> 01:44.800
I can't wait to starrrr-t.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.070
I can save up to buy a carrrr.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.770
Guys, we've got
bigger problems...

01:49.800 --> 01:52.910
- This blog.
- Oh, Miami h8ter girl.

01:52.940 --> 01:55.080
She writes about everything
she hates in Miami.

01:55.110 --> 01:57.710
She's so angry and bitter.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.780
I love her.

01:59.810 --> 02:02.750
Well, right now all
she hates is Austin.

02:02.780 --> 02:06.020
I mean look at all these
embarrassing videos she's posted.

02:06.050 --> 02:08.620
<i>Austin with broccoli
in his teeth.</i>

02:08.660 --> 02:10.620
Austin biting his toenails.

02:10.660 --> 02:12.660
<i>Austin checking out a girl.</i>

02:14.660 --> 02:15.660
Oh!

02:15.700 --> 02:17.970
That was <i>so</i> embarrassing.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.800

03:33.680 --> 03:35.510
I'm performing at the
mall this weekend.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.926
And I can't have all
this bad publicity.

03:36.950 --> 03:40.680
Oh, I've got it!
Embarrassing stuff, o.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.650
So don't do anything
embarrassing.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.790
You have broccoli in
your teeth again.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.660
Keep happening?

03:50.690 --> 03:52.830
I don't even eat broccoli.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.730
Maybe you should do
only good things.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.730
So h8ter girl to put on her site.
Bad.

03:58.770 --> 04:00.670
Great idea.

04:01.770 --> 04:03.740
Hey, Nelson, come here.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.810
How would you like a
shiny new quarter.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.610
- To make a wish in the fountain?
- Thanks.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.780
I'm gonna wish for a mustache.

04:12.910 --> 04:15.680
Yup, Austin moon is a good guy.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.550
Who makes little kids'
wishes come true.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.790
<i>Nelson! Oh!</i>

04:22.820 --> 04:24.690
I got you, Nelson.
Hang in there, buddy.

04:24.730 --> 04:25.960
Are you okay? Are you okay?

04:25.990 --> 04:27.900
It's gonna be okay. I... oh!

04:32.770 --> 04:34.600
You're supposed to let
go of the quarter.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.916
When you throw it
in the fountain.

04:35.940 --> 04:37.870
So no mustache?

04:38.940 --> 04:42.710
- Sorry, Nelson.
- Aw, nartz.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.950
Austin...

04:48.980 --> 04:51.520
You just saved Nelson.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.950
Whoo!

04:55.660 --> 04:57.930
I'd like to see h8ter
girl make that look bad.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.530
<i>"Austin dunks defenseless
boy into fountain"?</i>

05:03.570 --> 05:05.770
Wow, h8ter girl is good.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.540
I mean bad. I mean
good at being bad,

05:09.570 --> 05:10.886
Because she's a bad person
but she's just so good.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.670
At being a bad... I'll
stop talking now.

05:17.850 --> 05:21.880
Here you go. Sorrrr-y I
messed it up the first time.

05:22.980 --> 05:24.850
Dez, what are you doing?

05:24.890 --> 05:28.590
Frying a football. This thing
isn't just for frying fish.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.960
You can fry anything in here.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.760
Look,

05:31.790 --> 05:32.960
A hammer,

05:35.760 --> 05:37.830
My purse.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.930
That's my purse.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.600
Oh, that makes so
much more sense.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.940
- Pirate Trish.
- Yes, pirate Frank?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.610
I have to go walk the plank.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.850
That's pirate for
"use the bathroom."

05:52.910 --> 05:54.650
While I'm gone

05:54.680 --> 05:55.896
I need you to take
out the trash,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.890
Mop the floor and
batter the fish sticks.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.820
Aye aye, Captain.
I live to serve.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.860
Pirate Frank wants you
to take out the trash,

06:03.890 --> 06:05.890
Mop the floor and

06:05.930 --> 06:08.860
Oh man! What'd he
tell you to do?

06:08.900 --> 06:11.570
Read this fashion magazine.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.870
Ha ha, sucker!

06:18.770 --> 06:20.610
Where's my cellphone?

06:20.640 --> 06:22.480
I got it.

06:22.510 --> 06:25.550
I'd give it a few minutes to
cool off before you answer it.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.550
Ah.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.600
What's with the tent?

06:41.630 --> 06:43.630
I'm living here until
the mall concert.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.800
So h8ter girl can't get any
more bad footage of me.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.700
I've got everything I need...

06:47.740 --> 06:50.540
Food, video games, a bathroom...

06:50.570 --> 06:51.770
But that's a closet.

06:51.810 --> 06:54.640
Oh. Might not wanna go
in there for awhile.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.680
All right, first... eww.

06:56.710 --> 06:59.950
Second, I think
you're overreacting.

06:59.980 --> 07:01.880
It's just a harmless website.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.650
It's not like h8ter girl
is gonna ruin your career.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.850
H8ter girl is ruining
your career.

07:08.490 --> 07:10.820
- See?
- The owner of the mall saw.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.860
The video of you dunking Nelson into
the fountain and cancelled your kig.

07:13.900 --> 07:18.470
Apparently the mall has a no-dunking-kids-
into-the-fountain policy.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.870
So <i>strict.</i>

07:21.670 --> 07:23.470
That does it. We
need to find out.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.840
Who h8ter girl is and stop her.

07:24.870 --> 07:27.770
You're right, we can't let her
hurt your career any more.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.510
Come on, guys, let's...

07:29.540 --> 07:32.450
- What's with your shoes?
- I fried 'em.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.450
Delicious.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.520
There's no eating
shoes in the store.

07:36.550 --> 07:37.896
- There's no sign that says...
- There shouldn't have to be.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.790
A sign to not eat your shoes.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.620
Fine.

Don't shush me. You shush.

07:57.820 --> 08:00.620
- Can you just go?
- Dez, go. Just go.

08:02.530 --> 08:04.660
So why do we think h8ter
girl's going to show up?

08:04.690 --> 08:08.460
'cause Dez emailed her and said he
had embarrassing pictures of me.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.670
She said to leave them
in that recycling bin.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.400
When h8ter girl
comes to get them,

08:14.440 --> 08:16.510
We'll find out who she is.
It's perfect.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.540
She'll have no idea
we're hiding here.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.810
Hurry up, you doof!

08:25.680 --> 08:28.580
The chicken is in the Bucket.

08:28.620 --> 08:31.790
- Is that code for you made the drop?
- No, I brought chicken.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.590
I thought we might
be here for a while.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.419
- Mmm.
- Good call.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.360
Stakeouts can take all night.

08:37.390 --> 08:40.460
The key is to stay
alert and awake.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.640
The recycling bin is gone!

08:55.680 --> 08:56.856
Do you think h8ter girl took it?

08:56.880 --> 09:00.780
No, it sprouted
legs and ran away.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.490
Now what? We blew our shot.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.560
- At catching h8ter girl.
- Sorry, Austin,

09:06.590 --> 09:08.460
But look on the bright side...

09:08.490 --> 09:11.390
At least she didn't get any
embarrassing photos of you.

09:11.430 --> 09:13.400
All she got was an
empty envelope.

09:13.430 --> 09:16.570
<i>"old school photo
of Austin moon"?</i>

09:16.600 --> 09:19.470
Why did you give
her real pictures?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.340
Because I promised.

09:21.370 --> 09:23.746
She may be an evil blogger who's
out to destroy my best friend,

09:23.770 --> 09:25.670
But I am a man of my word.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.810
This h8ter girl's
driving me nuts.

09:28.850 --> 09:30.680
You know what's driving me nuts?

09:30.710 --> 09:32.780
Trying to read a magazine
with a hook hand.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.420
Your uniform could
be a lot worse.

09:38.450 --> 09:40.436
At least you're not the one
who has to greet customers.

09:40.460 --> 09:41.720
Dressed as a catfish.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.530
Wait a sec.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.776
That catfish doesn't work here.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.600
We don't serve catfish.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.600
We don't even serve real fish.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.400
That fish has been watching
us for five minutes.

09:54.540 --> 09:56.440
That must be h8ter girl.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.410
I'll get her.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.880
Tell pirate Frank
I've gone fishing.

10:09.890 --> 10:11.790
Hey, you catfish!

10:16.490 --> 10:18.730
Gotcha!

10:21.800 --> 10:23.506
- Oh oh, you've got her!
- Come on, get 'em!

10:23.530 --> 10:25.400
You've got her, just keep going.
Keep going.

10:25.430 --> 10:27.270
<i>Use those pirate muscles!
Trish: You can do it.</i>

10:31.870 --> 10:33.810
Let's see who h8ter girl is.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.410
Tilly Thompson?

10:37.450 --> 10:38.780
You know her?

10:38.810 --> 10:40.780
We went to
kindergarten together.

10:40.820 --> 10:42.620
You're h8ter girl?

10:42.650 --> 10:43.790
H8ter girl?

10:43.820 --> 10:47.420
You mean that beautiful,
amazingly talented girl.

10:47.460 --> 10:50.490
Who has that awesome website
about how much I hate Austin?

10:50.530 --> 10:51.760
Never heard of her.

10:51.790 --> 10:54.730
- Wait wait, hold on.
- Whoa whoa.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.830
You realize you just
admitted you're h8ter girl.

10:57.870 --> 11:00.640
I hate it when I admit things.

11:00.670 --> 11:03.670
I hate it. I hate it. I hate it!

11:04.940 --> 11:07.780
So how did you get all
those videos of me?

11:07.810 --> 11:10.610
I was always around you.
You just didn't realize,

11:10.650 --> 11:12.510
Because I'm a
master of disguise.

11:13.550 --> 11:15.720
Here's me as a cowboy,

11:15.750 --> 11:20.420
A biker, and here's my favorite.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.806
That lady pushing the stroller
doesn't look anything like you.

11:22.830 --> 11:24.630
I'm the baby.

11:24.660 --> 11:28.730
Wah! Wah! Burp me!

11:29.870 --> 11:32.470
Look, tilly, you seem like.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.570
A really nice, not-crazy girl.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.740
- Why do you hate me?
- I don't hate you.

11:38.770 --> 11:41.540
In fact, I think you're
an amazing singer.

11:41.580 --> 11:43.550
Really? Thanks.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.850
- I hate <i>her!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

11:45.880 --> 11:49.550
- What did I do?
- Oh, don't act like you don't know.

11:49.590 --> 11:51.790
I'm not acting. I
really don't know.

11:51.820 --> 11:55.460
You mean you don't spend
every minute of every day.

11:55.490 --> 11:57.760
Thinking about my song you
ruined in kindergarten?

11:57.790 --> 11:59.830
No.

11:59.860 --> 12:02.830
A person who dwells on
something every minute.

12:02.870 --> 12:06.400
Of every day for 10 years
would have to be insane...

12:06.440 --> 12:08.370
Ly talented.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.410
And pretty.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.480
How did Ally ruin your song?

12:13.510 --> 12:16.580
We were both in Mrs.
Carmichael's class.

12:16.610 --> 12:20.680
<i>As usual, Ally was being
her little bossy self.</i>

12:20.720 --> 12:23.850
There's no eating
in the classroom.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.660
I was in that class too.

12:28.690 --> 12:32.560
Guess who got a job
as the hall monitor!

12:34.700 --> 12:38.570
The spring pageant was coming up.
This year's theme was insects.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.600
I wrote "the ladybug
song." it was brilliant.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.410
♪ I'm a little ladybug.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.470
♪ I have black polka dots.

12:46.510 --> 12:49.810
♪ I love to eat pizza
and ride my bicycle. ♪

12:49.850 --> 12:53.620
<i>Everybody</i> lov <i>it.</i>

12:57.790 --> 12:59.790
It was kind of cute,

12:59.820 --> 13:02.560
But the lyrics wfre a
little all over the place.

13:02.590 --> 13:05.690
I mean, ladybugs
don't ride bikes.

13:05.730 --> 13:08.530
Oh, like you know
everything about ladybugs.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.370
I... I don't know everything,

13:10.400 --> 13:12.770
Just that they don't ride bikes.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.840
Whatever. The point is.

13:14.870 --> 13:17.640
You had to go and write
"the butterfly song."

13:17.670 --> 13:21.840
♪ I'm a little butterfly

13:21.880 --> 13:25.410
♪ spread my colorful wings

13:26.520 --> 13:30.490
♪ even though I'm
small and frail ♪

13:30.520 --> 13:35.660
♪ I can do most anything.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.790
<i>Everybody</i> hat <i>it.</i>

13:46.440 --> 13:49.840
And then the class picked which song
was going to be in the insect play.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.790
Which one did they pick?
Which one did they pick?

13:52.840 --> 13:55.540
- They picked Ally's.
- Oh, no way.

13:55.580 --> 13:56.910
I would be so mad if I were you.

13:58.850 --> 14:01.620
- You were saying?
- Not fair!

14:01.650 --> 14:03.690
My song was better!

14:07.660 --> 14:09.720
Ally, you will pay for this!

14:09.760 --> 14:11.760
Have fun singing with no lyrics.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.830
There's no eating
in the classroom.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.400
That was a special day for me.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.510
It was the first time I realized
I wanted to be a songwriter.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.540
It was a special day for me too.

14:28.580 --> 14:31.450
It was the first time I
got fired from a job.

14:31.480 --> 14:35.620
Apparently a hall monitor can't
charge kids to use the bathroom. Huh.

14:35.650 --> 14:38.650
Well, it wasn't a
special day for me.

14:38.690 --> 14:41.420
It was the day Ally
destroyed my dreams.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.530
Look, tilly,

14:43.560 --> 14:45.760
It was kindergarten.
We were kids.

14:45.790 --> 14:48.600
"kinder" is German for kids.

14:48.630 --> 14:50.730
And "garten" is
German for meatloaf.

14:50.770 --> 14:53.700
Kindergarten...
meatloaf made of kids.

14:53.740 --> 14:56.570
Your brain is made of meatloaf.

14:57.770 --> 14:59.650
- I don't understand.
- Well, it's one part kid,

14:59.680 --> 15:02.580
- One part hamburger, put 'em togher...
- No. Why are you.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.850
Taking it out on me if
you're mad at Ally?

15:04.880 --> 15:07.620
Because I figured by
ruining your career,

15:07.650 --> 15:09.780
I'll ruin <i>her</i> career.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.720
It's the perfect way
to get my revenge.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.790
Wait, wouldn't it be easier to
get revenge on Ally directly?

15:15.820 --> 15:18.330
That's a great idea.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.800
- Dez!
- I'm just saying cut out the middle man.

15:20.830 --> 15:23.530
Besides, it's not like I
told her how to get revenge,

15:23.570 --> 15:25.690
Like using your stage fright
against you or something.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.400
Dez!

15:28.440 --> 15:30.740
That's exactly what
I'm going to do.

15:30.770 --> 15:32.840
We're gonna have a little
show here at the mall.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.710
And reverse what happened
in kindergarten,

15:38.750 --> 15:40.620
You're gonna sing
your butterfly song.

15:40.650 --> 15:42.620
And look stupid because
of your stage fright.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.590
And I'm gonna sing
"the ladybug song"

15:44.620 --> 15:46.620
And everybody's
going to love me.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.660
Uh, what if I don't sing
the butterfly song?

15:50.690 --> 15:53.600
Then I'm going to keep posting
bad stuff about Austin.

15:53.630 --> 15:55.700
And make sure he never
plays another gig again.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.510
I can't do this.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.650
They're staring at me.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.380
They're stuffed animals.
They don't blink.

16:23.420 --> 16:25.490
Well, that one laughed at me.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.560
It's Larry the laughing lizard.

That's what he does.

16:33.530 --> 16:34.760
I just don't get it.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.760
You didn't have stage
fright in kindergarten.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.630
- What happened since then?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

16:39.670 --> 16:43.400
I mean, now you can't even sing
in front of a bunch of sweet,

16:43.440 --> 16:47.410
Little fuzzy animals with their cute
little eyes. And can I keep this one?

16:47.440 --> 16:50.850
Look, Austin, I promise
if I ever want to talk.

It's really sweet that you care.

Now give me back
Dougie the dolphin.

17:01.690 --> 17:04.660
You know you don't have to go onstage
and embarrass yourself like this.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.359
Yes, I do.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.560
If I don't, tilly's gonna
destroy your career.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.730
I'd rather face my biggest
fear than have that happen.

17:11.770 --> 17:14.540
Thanks, Ally. That means a lot.

17:14.569 --> 17:17.740
You're gonna sing as beautiful
as the sunset out there.

17:18.839 --> 17:21.710
Don't touch my dolphin.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.680

tilly's forcing Ally.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.380
To sing onstage and we're
not there to see it.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.826
Well, you're a good friend
for wanting to support her.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.420
No. She could have a meltdown.

17:34.460 --> 17:35.736
And yak on someone
in the front row.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.490
I don't wanna miss that.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.600
But yeah, also the
support thing.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.400
We could ask for the night off.

17:45.430 --> 17:48.540
That's not how I do things.
We need to get fired.

17:48.570 --> 17:52.470
In that case, there is something
that I have been <i>dying</i> to do.

Those of you in the front row.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.760
Whoa, you heard her, folks.

She shut down her
