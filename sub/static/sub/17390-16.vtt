WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:04.303
Okay, the Burns Brothers
Construction website

00:04.305 --> 00:06.772
is live... now.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.307
Yeah!
All right.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.641
Well, it's been live
for a while, but I thought

00:09.643 --> 00:11.543
this way would be more dramatic.
And it was.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.012
(chuckling):
Oh...

00:13.014 --> 00:14.313
This is great, Lowell.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.081
I love the pictures.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.451
Hey, thanks for making
my arm muscles so big.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.420
Fun fact,
those are Hulk Hogan's arms.

00:23.524 --> 00:27.526
Why did you give Don
a handlebar mustache?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.261
Well, I asked for that.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.063
It makes me look
like a riverboat gambler.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.698
Oh.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.800
I think it makes you look
like a '70s porn star.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.769
(laughs)

00:39.340 --> 00:40.322
I like that better.

00:40.323 --> 00:41.305
Uh, hey, I meant to ask.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.308
Sunday night,
how about you and Andi

00:43.310 --> 00:44.743
have dinner with me and Jen?

00:44.745 --> 00:46.678
Who's Jen? Your parrot?

00:46.680 --> 00:50.049
No, she's my wife.
Oh.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.583
Adam, I don't know
if you know this,

00:51.585 --> 00:55.521
but I consider you a role model,
a mentor, a hero.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.523
Andi, you hear that?
You're married to a hero.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.191
(exhales proudly)

00:59.193 --> 01:00.592
It would really mean a lot to me

01:00.594 --> 01:02.694
if you guys got to be friends
with Jen.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.296
Well, I can't believe we might
actually meet your wife.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.230
I mean,
I've known you three years,

01:05.232 --> 01:06.632
I've never seen her once.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.133
Yeah, she travels a lot
for work,

01:08.135 --> 01:09.668
but she's in town right now.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.237
Uh-huh. And by travels, you mean
flies around like a parrot?

01:12.239 --> 01:14.139
(laughs)

01:14.141 --> 01:16.208
No, she's not a bird, Don.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.410
All right, all right, all right,
Lowell, let's speak freely.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.812
Okay, is there a chance
that at dinner,

01:19.814 --> 01:22.214
you will excuse yourself
and go upstairs

01:22.216 --> 01:24.416
and come back down in a dress
calling yourself Jen? Huh?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.518
(Don and Adam laugh)

01:26.520 --> 01:29.154
Like-like a
<i> Mrs. Doubtfire</i> thing.
Yeah.

01:29.156 --> 01:32.758
Jen exists. She's not a parrot,
she's not Mrs. Doubtfire.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.327
I've never had to say
any of this.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.795
Lowell, we're sorry.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.464
We would love to have dinner
with you guys.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.498
Uh, why don't you come over
Sunday night?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.133
I'll make a lasagna.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.801
Yeah, maybe pull the blinds
over the windows

01:42.803 --> 01:44.770
so she doesn't fly
into the glass. (laughs)

01:48.776 --> 01:50.275
She's not a bird, Don.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.510
Thank you.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.178
Yeah, I'm vouching for you here,

01:53.180 --> 01:54.780
so I'm gonna look like an idiot
if you walk in the door

01:54.782 --> 01:55.781
with your wife on your shoulder.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.286
All right, Lowell and
Jen'll be here any minute.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.753
I got three bottles of wine.
Do you think that's enough?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.523
I have no idea.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.325
I mean,
we don't know who or what

02:06.327 --> 02:07.493
is gonna come through
that front door with Lowell.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.330
I mean, we've never seen Jen.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.731
Yeah. There's got
to be a reason.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.399
Yeah.
Maybe she's really old.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.401
You know?

02:16.403 --> 02:18.704
Like, uh, Granny
from<i> The Beverly Hillbillies.</i>

02:20.407 --> 02:23.142
Hey, I could see
Granny marrying Lowell.
Yeah.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.644
Look, how-how late do you think
this thing is gonna go?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.246
'Cause I got
a very important date

02:27.248 --> 02:29.748
with taking off my pants
and watching TV.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.784
I am way ahead of you on that.
Katie's gonna come down

02:32.786 --> 02:34.920
around 9:30
and say she's not feeling well.

02:34.922 --> 02:35.721
End the night
gracefully.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.423
Nice. Nice.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.359
We'll sick-kid 'em.
I mean, we spent a lot of money

02:40.361 --> 02:42.161
on these kids, it's time
to get some use out of 'em.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.462
Right?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.363
(doorbell rings)

02:49.203 --> 02:50.636
Hi, everybody. This is Jen.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.311
He's alone.
It's happening.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.846
No, she's coming
right behind me.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.548
Oh, hi.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.321
Dad, my birthday
wish came true.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.392
Â¶ Â¶

03:23.270 --> 03:24.870
And that's when
I realized I couldn't be

03:24.872 --> 03:26.205
a swimsuit
model forever.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.307
So I opened
my own agency.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.841
You were a model?
Mm-hmm.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.377
I-I can see that. Sure, sure.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.747
Not to brag, but she was
the first one to say

03:35.749 --> 03:37.916
"Why do we only
show cleavage from the front?

03:37.918 --> 03:40.552
Why can't we show some
from the side?"

03:41.855 --> 03:43.889
You invented side-boob?

03:45.659 --> 03:49.228
So how-how come we never
see you around school?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.629
Well, I travel
a lot for work.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.464
And I hate to
miss that stuff.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.932
You know how it is when
you're a working mom.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.667
You always feel guilty
about something.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.870
I do know that. Oh, my God.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.572
I love her.
She gets me.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.842
Just like
I get you, Adam.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.548
This doesn't seem fair.

04:11.518 --> 04:12.818
So how did you two meet?

04:12.820 --> 04:13.752
Like,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.020
what place are you two people

04:15.022 --> 04:16.722
both going?

04:16.724 --> 04:20.459
It's actually a pretty
romantic story.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.728
We were in the Peace Corps,
building schools in the Amazon.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.664
What the-- what? The Amazon?

04:25.666 --> 04:28.000
One day, we were
deep in the jungle

04:28.002 --> 04:30.369
and I fell and
broke my ankle.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.472
And Lowell carried me
two miles back to camp.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.473
You carried her?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.009
Wait, this
really happened?

04:37.011 --> 04:38.343
Pick her up right now.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.914
And this sweet, caring man
spent hours with me

04:42.916 --> 04:44.549
each day while
I recovered.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.752
She would sleep
and I would just watch her.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.590
First woman I ever dated
who didn't find that disturbing.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.760
So anyway, just before
I was sent home,

04:54.762 --> 04:56.528
Lowell made me
this little house

04:56.530 --> 04:58.797
out of twigs that
he wove together

04:58.799 --> 05:01.333
to represent the home
we would live in someday.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.469
And that sealed
the deal.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.606
L.L.W.
Ladies love weaving.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.444
So that's our story.
How did you two meet?

05:17.451 --> 05:19.951
Uh, it was, uh, kind of
a similar situation.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.821
Yeah, there was an injury.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.625
Uh, Andi got thrown off
a mechanical bull.

05:26.627 --> 05:30.662
And I treated the pain
with, uh, tequila.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.000
L.L.T. Ladies love tequila.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.001
(both laugh)

05:36.003 --> 05:38.503
Mom, Dad,

05:38.505 --> 05:39.938
I'm not feeling very well.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.340
Yeah, yeah, just
go to sleep.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.577
But Mom told me
to come down here...

05:45.579 --> 05:46.712
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.113
No, uh-uh. Nope.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.481
No. Love you. Off you go.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.884
Teenagers.
(scoffs)

05:55.089 --> 05:57.389
Um, so why don't you guys
go into the living room

05:57.391 --> 05:58.490
and, uh, we'll bring in
some coffees?

05:58.492 --> 05:59.791
Yeah.
I'll help.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.727
Okay.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.928
(clears throat)

06:02.930 --> 06:04.496
ANDI:
Wow, Lowell,

06:04.498 --> 06:06.131
she's so great.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.799
I mean, who knew
you were such a secret stud?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.835
(chuckles)
Thanks.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.670
I still have a lot to learn
from Adam.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.605
I'm not sure you do.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.675
Well, I'm glad
you guys like her.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.642
(Adam chuckles)

06:19.146 --> 06:22.381
Wow. We have a cool new
friend couple.

06:22.383 --> 06:25.083
I know, I can't believe we
were gonna sick-kid them.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.620
No, we were gonna sick-kid
Lowell and Lowell in a dress.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.422
Now, let's get in there
and party with our new friends.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.457
We might even stay up
past 10:00.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.893
Ooh. Like we almost did
on New Year's Eve.
Yeah.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.097
Where you guys going?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.999
Oh, I'm so sorry. We just got
a text from our babysitter

06:41.001 --> 06:42.434
that our daughter
isn't feeling well.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.435
So we have to go.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.778
You have a sick kid?

06:52.780 --> 06:55.147
Yeah. She probably has
the same thing Kate does.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.015
Oh.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.184
I'm sure she has exactly
the same thing Kate does.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.552
(Andi chuckles)
Thanks for everything.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.653
Nice to meet you guys.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.788
ANDI:
You, too.
Bye-bye.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.855
Okay, bye-bye.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.659
You know what just happened.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.161
Yeah.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.662
They sick-kidded us.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.664
(scoffs)

07:14.535 --> 07:16.568
(sighs)

07:16.570 --> 07:18.036
You still want to stay up
till 10:00?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.571
Well, not if it's just us.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.878
So, Lowell's wife
is a hottie, huh?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.180
She's all right.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.748
Oh, come on.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.116
All right, she's smokin'.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.984
(laughing):
Yeah.

07:32.986 --> 07:36.588
And-and-- and she's past the
kind of hot that makes you mad.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.057
You just-- you just want
to give her presents. I...

07:40.494 --> 07:41.893
How do you think
he pulled that off?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.662
Well, I know what it is.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.198
Lowell smells like a baby
and women love babies.

07:47.568 --> 07:51.136
That's as good
an explanation as any.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.905
So are you guys gonna hang
out with those guys again?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.907
Probably not.
They sick-kidded us.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.909
Ooh.
Ooh, that's rough, man.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.679
Yeah, I mean, I was all set
for a night of partying

08:00.681 --> 08:02.747
and then it was just me
wandering around the house

08:02.749 --> 08:04.616
in my robe, looking
for my reading glasses.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.652
And they were
on my head.
Yeah.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.723
Well, looks like you
guys are the number two

08:13.927 --> 08:14.710
couple now.
(chuckles)
Yeah.

08:14.711 --> 08:15.494
Just like we
usually are.
Mm-hmm.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.728
Oh, what are you talking about?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.029
Oh, come on. When we hang out,

08:18.031 --> 08:18.997
you guys are
the number one couple

08:18.999 --> 08:20.198
and we're number two.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.100
That's not true.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.102
And you don't
rank couples.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.005
You rank colleges
and football teams,

08:27.007 --> 08:30.075
and, secretly,
your kids.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.244
You know how it is. When
we go to the movies,

08:32.246 --> 08:34.779
you get the aisle seats,
you get to choose the candy.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.848
Raisinets? What
are you guys, 70?

08:38.252 --> 08:39.851
I like Raisinets.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.720
Me, too.
Yeah, what's wrong
with that?

08:41.722 --> 08:43.822
You know you can buy
your own candy, right?

08:43.824 --> 08:47.125
Babe, maybe we should get
together with Lowell and Jen.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.260
No, no, no.
We call dibs.

08:48.262 --> 08:49.694
Dibs have been called.
Everybody heard it.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.231
Well, your dibs have no meaning

08:53.233 --> 08:54.566
since they pretended
to have a sick kid

08:54.568 --> 08:55.700
just to get away from you.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.837
Wha-- no, no, no, no.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.205
We don't know for sure
they were pretending.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.907
Their daughter might
have actually been sick.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.976
Yeah, kids get sick.
It happens all the time.
Yeah.

09:04.978 --> 09:08.580
It's just funny to watch you
guys get all bent out of shape

09:08.582 --> 09:10.248
being somebody's
number two. (chuckles)

09:10.250 --> 09:11.616
We are not number two.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.184
Yeah, and I'll prove it
to you.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.620
I'm doing school pickup
tomorrow and I guarantee you

09:15.622 --> 09:17.556
their daughter
is gonna be out sick.
Yeah.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.790
ADAM: Yeah and when
that little girl

09:18.792 --> 09:22.294
is sick, we are gonna
laugh and laugh.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.597
Well, you know
what I mean.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.001
(knocks on door)

09:30.003 --> 09:31.169
Hey, butterbean.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.138
Hey, Mrs. Rodriguez.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.307
How's it going?
How's your, uh...

09:35.309 --> 09:36.741
whatever you have?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.643
What do you want, Burns?

09:38.645 --> 09:40.078
Well, uh, I was just wondering,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.213
uh, was Lowell's daughter
in school today?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.048
Lucy?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.349
Well, I don't know.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.984
Sure, let's say Lucy.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.686
Yeah, she was here.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.721
What? And she seemed okay?
No sniffles?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.755
No.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.957
Cough?
No.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.292
Pox of any kind?

09:54.294 --> 09:55.727
Yeah, she was fine.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.828
What's going on?
Nothing.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.630
I just...

09:58.632 --> 10:00.165
We were at dinner with Lowell
and Jen the other night.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.334
And they said their daughter
was sick and left early.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.336
(laughs)

10:04.338 --> 10:06.271
You got sick-kidded.
(laughs)

10:06.273 --> 10:07.872
See, that's when people
make up that...

10:07.874 --> 10:08.873
I know what it is.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.077
Well?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.945
She's perfectly healthy.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.914
Son of a bitch!

10:22.623 --> 10:24.756
I can't believe Lowell
and Jen would lie about

10:24.758 --> 10:26.224
having a sick kid just so
they wouldn't have to

10:26.226 --> 10:28.259
hang out with us.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.861
I know, it seemed clever
when we thought of it,

10:29.863 --> 10:31.129
but just hurtful
when they did it.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.799
You know what this is?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.835
They think we're boring.

10:36.837 --> 10:37.902
Us?

10:37.904 --> 10:39.771
Boring?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.406
(chuckles)

10:41.408 --> 10:43.675
Do boring people go to Orlando?

10:43.677 --> 10:44.743
I don't...
(chuckles)

10:47.814 --> 10:51.016
I'm just saying, we don't do
all the stuff we used to do

10:51.018 --> 10:52.884
when we were younger.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.687
Well, we're not as limber
as we were back then.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.188
You know? I mean,

10:57.190 --> 10:58.356
with my back, I
can't get around...
No, no, no,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.091
not that stuff. No!

11:02.729 --> 11:05.063
This is just-- it...
this is a wake-up call.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.399
Oh, I hate wake-up calls.

11:07.401 --> 11:10.068
Well, I mean, come on,

11:10.070 --> 11:10.902
when we were 26,

11:10.904 --> 11:12.437
we were super cool.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.040
I mean, we used to
hang out at bars,

11:15.042 --> 11:16.841
and-and go to concerts, and...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.076
stay awake
for the end of movies.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.379
I mean, did Matt Damon
ever get off Mars?

11:21.381 --> 11:23.348
We don't know.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.085
I mean, when-when was
the last time we went to,

11:27.087 --> 11:28.153
I don't know, a play?

11:28.155 --> 11:29.688
Last spring.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.389
Harlem Globetrotters.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.125
That's not a play.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.929
Good defeats evil, it's like
the oldest story there is.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.833
Just-- doesn't last night
make you wonder if...

11:41.835 --> 11:44.202
I don't know, we've
slipped a little?

11:46.206 --> 11:49.140
Come on, who cares
if we've slipped a little?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.943
Huh? The whole point
of being married

11:51.945 --> 11:54.279
is that we don't have to do
interesting things anymore.

11:57.117 --> 12:01.953
This is the time of our lives
to just stay home and eat.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.055
Hmm?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.924
We're fine, okay?

12:05.926 --> 12:07.726
Okay.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.027
Well, then...

12:09.029 --> 12:11.062
why did Lowell and Jen
bail on us?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.497
I don't know.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.332
I guess we were expecting
Granny Clampett,

12:14.334 --> 12:17.135
so we half-assed the dinner.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.837
Oh, my God, you're right.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.405
We didn't bring our A game.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.174
I mean, obviously,
we can do better, right?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.009
Well, of course we can.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.878
We're fun.
We're Andi and Adam, damn it.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.980
Hell yeah, we are,
we're interesting.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.049
Yeah-- hey, hey! Hey.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.384
Terry Bradshaw tried to sleep
with you on a plane.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.320
(scoffs)

12:35.322 --> 12:38.056
How did we not tell that story?

12:38.058 --> 12:41.159
Because Jen was like
a flash grenade, you know?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.328
We were stunned.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.230
The lady invented side-boob.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.397
I mean,

12:46.399 --> 12:49.367
what kind of boob did we invent?

12:49.369 --> 12:51.169
None.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.305
Well, I accidentally invented
one in and one out

12:54.307 --> 12:56.007
on a roller coaster.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.809
Right, right,

12:57.811 --> 12:59.911
when you flashed that
church group at Six Flags.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.045
Yeah.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.413
Yeah, another good story.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.948
Yeah. Okay,
you know what?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.383
Here's what
we're gonna do:

13:05.385 --> 13:06.818
I'm gonna make some of my famous

13:06.820 --> 13:08.419
ginger chicken soup,

13:08.421 --> 13:10.789
and we're gonna casually
swing by their place,

13:10.791 --> 13:13.057
and drop it off
for their fake sick kid.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.360
Nice, yeah, and they'll
have to invite us in

13:15.362 --> 13:17.028
because that's what you do.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.063
Yeah, and-and-and
we'll be charming,

13:19.065 --> 13:20.298
and we'll-we'll give
them our stories,

13:20.300 --> 13:21.566
the Terry Bradshaw
mile high club

13:21.568 --> 13:23.968
and the roller coaster
peek-a-boo.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.204
Yeah, yeah-- well, wait,

13:26.206 --> 13:28.273
how will we know if we
turned this thing around?

13:28.275 --> 13:30.809
Because they'll want to
make plans with us again.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.077
We get the plans,
Adam and Andi are back.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.146
(chuckles)

13:35.148 --> 13:37.148
Where are you going?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.483
To the store, I don't have
time to make soup.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.590
Hey!
Hi, there!

13:45.592 --> 13:47.158
Hey, guys.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.393
Um, I-I made some soup

13:48.395 --> 13:49.928
for your sick daughter.
Yeah, honey,

13:49.930 --> 13:51.396
didn't you get the
recipe for that soup

13:51.398 --> 13:53.131
from Terry Bradshaw when
he tried to sleep with you

13:57.337 --> 13:58.820
on an airplane?

13:58.821 --> 14:00.304
Yeah, that is where
I got it, yeah. (chuckles)

14:00.307 --> 14:01.372
I've got to hear
the end of that story.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.907
Come on in.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.209
Wait, that is the
end of the story,

14:04.211 --> 14:06.211
there's no more story.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.912
I don't know,

14:07.914 --> 14:09.414
maybe just say you
slept with him. Come on.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.217
Can I get you
guys a drink?

14:12.219 --> 14:13.451
I'm just muddling some limes.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.286
Oh, what'd they ever do to you?

14:15.288 --> 14:16.588
(all laugh)

14:16.590 --> 14:18.923
Stick to the stories.
Yeah, okay.

14:18.925 --> 14:22.093
Oh, hey, uh, Jen, is that
the house Lowell made for you?

14:22.095 --> 14:23.328
Yeah.
That's really impressive.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.296
Oh, wow.
You know, uh,

14:25.298 --> 14:27.232
Adam made a people-sized
house all by himself

14:27.234 --> 14:28.566
when he was only 22.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.168
Really?
Yeah.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.538
And it fell down by
the time he was 23.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.441
Don? Marcy?

14:36.443 --> 14:39.110
I was just giving them a tour
and we heard your voices.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.879
We thought it'd be fun to
reach out to new friends.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.114
You know, who might like
different movie candy.
Mm-hmm.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.952
That's a very specific thing
to look for in a friend.

14:47.954 --> 14:49.654
Lowell, let's take this soup in
the kitchen and we'll bring out

14:49.656 --> 14:51.256
coffee and desserts
for everyone.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.590
Oh, that's sweet, Jen.
Oh, that's nice.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.325
Thank you.
Thanks.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.994
(laughing):
Okay.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.595
What are you doing here?
We had dibs.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.900
They disregarded
our dibs.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.534
Listen, you need to leave
so that Lowell and Jen

15:03.536 --> 15:06.371
can see what an interesting
couple Andi and I are.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.072
We are not leaving,
you guys had your chance

15:08.074 --> 15:09.407
and you screwed
the pooch.
Mm-hmm.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.042
What...

15:11.044 --> 15:13.378
Whoa, I wouldn't say
we screwed the pooch.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.679
I mean, if anything,

15:14.681 --> 15:16.648
we just-- we-we
underwhelmed the pooch.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.551
Marcy, Don's only here so
he can see how hot Jen is.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.153
That's why I'm here, too.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.957
Us hot people, we like
to check each other out.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.227
We're just looking around
for new couple friends since,

15:29.229 --> 15:30.695
well, you guys made it
pretty clear the other night

15:30.697 --> 15:32.130
what you really
think of us.
Yeah.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.531
You guys
said all that.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.933
Yeah, you
didn't disagree.

15:34.935 --> 15:39.003
No, we did disagree.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.072
Yeah, but, you know,
we didn't believe you.
Yeah.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.074
And we thought,
if we're number two,

15:43.076 --> 15:44.575
then we should upgrade

15:44.577 --> 15:46.044
and be number
two with them.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.513
Yeah, us number
twos are scrappy.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.214
We're survivors.
Yeah.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.184
Oh, they invited us to
take a trip with them

15:53.186 --> 15:54.452
to see the wildflowers.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.020
(gasps)
They took our plans.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.188
We're number three!
No.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.190
Okay, honey,
this is ridiculous.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.558
All right? We don't
need other people

16:00.560 --> 16:03.061
to make us feel
good about ourselves.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.395
We're Adam and Andi.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.597
Yeah.
Right?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.299
I mean,
Terry Bradshaw,

16:08.301 --> 16:09.367
or a man that looked
somewhat like him,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.502
hit on me once.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.272
Wait, you're saying it
wasn't actually...
Oh, not now!

16:14.274 --> 16:15.373
You're right, you're right,
let's just go say our good-byes.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.008
Yeah, and the most
important thing is

16:17.010 --> 16:18.309
that we leave here
with our dignity.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.377
(chuckles)
Yeah.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.582
Hey, hi.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.250
Oh, you don't need
to weld our desserts.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.385
We're, uh, we're taking off.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.620
What? No.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.255
Yeah, well, we
don't want to impose.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.490
I mean, you know
what they say:

16:32.492 --> 16:34.158
multiples of two
is company,

16:34.160 --> 16:37.495
and multiples of three is
a crowd. (awkward laugh)

16:37.497 --> 16:39.263
But we don't
want you to go.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.265
Let me rephrase that,

16:41.267 --> 16:43.034
I'm begging
you not to go.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.669
Look, Don and Marcy

16:44.671 --> 16:46.137
are lovely people.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.705
They're
delightful, but...

16:47.707 --> 16:49.440
Don looks at me like we're
stranded in a cartoon boat

16:49.442 --> 16:50.742
and I'm a giant
turkey leg.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.079
And Marcy keeps asking
why Jen is with me.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.414
Like, over and over.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.516
It's starting to
hurt my feelings.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.251
That's terrible.
What'd you say?

17:00.253 --> 17:01.285
(slaps leg)
Ah!

17:03.556 --> 17:06.190
But you made plans to go see
the wildflowers with them.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.060
I didn't. I said we're driving
up to see the wildflowers

17:09.062 --> 17:11.029
and Don yelled
"Shotgun."

17:11.031 --> 17:13.197
I just, I...

17:13.199 --> 17:15.066
I thought you didn't
like us very much.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.567
What gave you that idea?

17:16.569 --> 17:19.270
Well, because the other night,
you said Lucy was sick and...

17:19.272 --> 17:21.539
And then she was in
school today, so...

17:21.541 --> 17:23.674
No, it's our little one,
Zoe, she has a cold.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.109
(gasps)

17:25.111 --> 17:26.744
I forgot they had
a second kid.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.515
I just got goose bumps.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.420
But you knew someone was sick
or you wouldn't have made soup.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.522
And what kind of person
would make up a sick child

17:37.524 --> 17:39.323
to get out of something?

17:39.325 --> 17:41.692
(both laughing nervously)
I have no idea.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.728
So it's settled. You'll stay?

17:43.730 --> 17:46.264
And you'll come with us
to see the wildflowers?

17:46.266 --> 17:47.765
Uh.... sounds
like a plan.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.434
(chuckles)

17:49.436 --> 17:51.736
Wildflowers
with my hero.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.438
I'm going to scrapbook
the dickens out of this.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.475
If it doesn't have glitter
and a decorative border,

17:57.477 --> 17:59.477
it didn't happen.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.112
Memories.
Memories.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.182
(Lowell and Adam chuckle)

18:04.184 --> 18:07.118
Ah. They make sense now.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.586
She's weird, too.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.822
Yeah, but all I heard
is we have plans

18:10.824 --> 18:12.223
and we are back.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.491
(chuckles)
Feels good.

18:14.561 --> 18:15.827
(laughter)

18:15.829 --> 18:17.328
What a lovely evening.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.830
Yes, you are.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.298
Yes, it was.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.566
You are.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.335
Well, this was fun.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.703
But you two, I
still don't get it.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.371
(laughs)

18:27.373 --> 18:29.807
Because we're soul mates.
Deep breath.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.543
Four, five.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.378
(chuckles)

18:36.549 --> 18:38.649
Jen, I'll get everyone's coats.
Why don't you check on Zoe?

18:38.651 --> 18:39.717
Okay.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.658
So are you guys
still mad?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.428
I didn't like that
you had alone time

18:50.430 --> 18:52.830
with them
in the kitchen.

18:52.832 --> 18:53.865
Look, we're sorry
we made you feel

18:53.867 --> 18:55.366
like number twos,
all right?

18:55.368 --> 18:57.135
We'll-we'll work
on that.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.736
Yeah, we don't want
to fight with you guys.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.372
You're family and
you're our best friends.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.175
Well, I'm sure some
of it was our fault.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.810
I mean, I don't really, but I
said it, and that's what counts.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.916
So Lowell, huh?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.551
(all scoff)

19:13.553 --> 19:15.286
And I can't believe
he built this house.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.388
I know,
pretty cool, huh?

19:17.390 --> 19:18.456
I mean, look
at the detail.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.458
Every corner
is perfect.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.559
Oh, my gosh!
(all yelling)

19:23.196 --> 19:24.362
Oh!

19:24.364 --> 19:25.630
Whoa!

19:25.632 --> 19:27.231
Oh, uh... oh.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.933
No, no, no!
Okay.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.736
Ah.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.704
Adam!
Ah. Oh, here,
here, here, here.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.805
Here. Geez.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.942
(Marcy and Don sigh in relief,
Andi spits)

19:39.212 --> 19:40.278
Oh...

19:42.315 --> 19:43.548
(spits)

19:45.852 --> 19:47.618
Adam, what did you do?

19:54.727 --> 19:57.228
ANDI: Wait, where are you going?
We got to go, our kid's sick!

19:57.230 --> 19:59.263
(door closes)
What a couple
of number twos!

20:04.704 --> 20:06.304
Oh, my.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.374
Uh, I'm not gonna say
who did it,

20:09.375 --> 20:10.875
but ask yourself,
who just ran out the door?

20:12.278 --> 20:14.278
It's-it's okay.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.514
Actually, uh, I didn't weave it,

20:16.516 --> 20:19.517
I bought it
from a street vendor in Peru.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.385
That guy was talented.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.287
What I wove was the story

20:23.289 --> 20:24.455
that went along with the house.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.924
Oh. What are you gonna tell Jen?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.459
I'll tell her
Don burned it

20:28.461 --> 20:29.694
and I'll be free
from the shackles

20:29.696 --> 20:31.629
of this lie forever.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.397
Just promise me
you'll keep my secret.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.398
Uh, it's okay,
Lowell,

20:34.400 --> 20:35.800
everyone has secrets.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.635
Andi's famous
ginger chicken soup?

20:37.637 --> 20:39.403
We bought it at a gas station.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.873
It was really just chicken soup
that we poured ginger ale into.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.342
I'd throw it out.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.743
