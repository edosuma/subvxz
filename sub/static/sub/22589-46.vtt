<i>NARRATOR".
When last we saw our beleaguered battlers...</i>

00:15.141 --> 00:19.729
<i>...they were slowly sinking in a bitter batter
of Riddler quicksand.</i>

00:19.938 --> 00:22.482
<i>A grim and gritty end awaits them...</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:27.820

01:40.643 --> 01:43.896
Holy Titanic, Batman.
We're going down for the last time.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.815
Don't be a pessimist, Robin.

01:46.024 --> 01:50.111
Many of those who survived that tragedy
did so by remaining calm and treading water...

01:50.320 --> 01:52.989
...until help arrived.
-But this is quicksand.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.365
I know, Robin.

01:54.574 --> 01:58.578
But I seem to recall a recent report
on jungle survival...

01:58.786 --> 02:01.831
...which indicated
that many victims of quicksand...

02:02.040 --> 02:05.543
...are victims because of their own panic.
-Not doing a lot for my nerves.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.088
The specific gravity of quicksand
approximates that of water.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.923
If we remain calm and motionless...

02:11.132 --> 02:14.802
...we shouldn't sink much farther
than your lower lip.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.142
-It's working, Batman.
-Yes.

02:21.351 --> 02:24.437
One thing worries me, though,
how long can we keep floating?

02:24.646 --> 02:27.231
We won't have to float long, old churn.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.444
If our experimental Heel-and-toe Bat-rockets
perform as well as they should.

02:31.653 --> 02:34.530
Experimental Heel-and-toe Bat-rockets?
Haven't been tested yet.

02:34.739 --> 02:37.533
Let's not put off till tomorrow
what we can do today, Robin.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.036
As I begin the countdown...

02:40.244 --> 02:44.957
...slowly reach for the Heel-and-toe
Bat-rocket controls in your utility belt.

02:45.166 --> 02:49.462
Remember, any sudden movement...

02:49.671 --> 02:53.925
...will disturb our equilibrium,
and we can't afford to sink much further.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.719
Now, on the count of zero...

02:56.928 --> 02:59.555
...activate your Bat-rockets.
-Roger.

03:00.139 --> 03:02.058
Zero minus five...

03:02.475 --> 03:04.185
...zero minus four...

03:04.727 --> 03:07.271
...zero minus three...

03:07.897 --> 03:09.399
...zero minus two...

03:11.234 --> 03:13.236
...zero minus one.

03:14.404 --> 03:15.988
Zero.

03:19.701 --> 03:21.869
<i>NARRATOR".
Later at the Riddler's hideout...</i>

03:22.078 --> 03:25.581
<i>...in the soon to be opened
Noman Jigsaw Puzzle Factory...</i>

03:25.790 --> 03:30.920
<i>...the magic of electronics provides the Riddler
and his band of malevolent yeoman...</i>

03:31.129 --> 03:36.050
<i>...with a fascinating account
of their latest criminal coup.</i>

03:41.264 --> 03:43.307
<i>All of Gotham City is aghast today...</i>

03:43.516 --> 03:46.811
<i>...at the daring daylight robbery
in Gotham City Square Park...</i>

03:47.145 --> 03:51.441
<i>...in which $1 million of charity funds
accumulated in Batman's honor...</i>

03:51.649 --> 03:55.027
<i>...was snatched from the hands of the poor
by the light-fingered Riddler.</i>

03:55.194 --> 03:57.029
<i>- Light-fingered?
- He and his henchmen...</i>

03:57.196 --> 04:00.241
Yes, that's what I am.
Light-fingered, nimble, quick.

04:00.450 --> 04:01.492
Wonderful.

04:01.701 --> 04:04.245
<i>In</i> a <i>joint statement
issued just minutes ago...</i>

04:04.412 --> 04:07.123
<i>...Commissioner Gordon
and Batman and Robin...</i>

04:07.331 --> 04:11.836
<i>...promised an intensified search
for the perpetrators of this shameless crime...</i>

04:12.044 --> 04:14.797
<i>...and the speedy recovery
of the charity funds.</i>

04:15.006 --> 04:17.550
<i>The following riddle
left at the scene of the crime...</i>

04:17.759 --> 04:19.719
<i>provides their only clue.</i>

04:19.927 --> 04:24.098
<i>"When is an eagle's nest blessed best?"</i>

04:28.561 --> 04:30.688
That mealy-mouth faker.

04:30.897 --> 04:34.317
Issued a joint statement
with Batman and Robin, did he?

04:34.525 --> 04:35.860
Well, he knows and we know...

04:36.068 --> 04:41.532
...that the Caped Crusaders
are defunct, departed, demised, dead.

04:41.741 --> 04:42.867
What if he isn't lying?

04:43.075 --> 04:45.870
- What if Batman and Robin are--?
-Alive?

04:46.078 --> 04:47.497
Impossible, dear Anna Gram.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.041
Even if it were possible,
it couldn't matter less.

04:50.249 --> 04:55.296
One more cunning caper and I'll have the prize
of Professor Charm's demolecularizer.

04:55.505 --> 04:59.509
Then let them send the regiment of Batmen
against me.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.430
When is an eagle's nest blessed best?

05:04.889 --> 05:08.351
Seems to me that any nest
is most blessed when there are little ones in it.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.603
- Yes.
-Or nest eggs.

05:10.812 --> 05:13.648
- Riddler is after a nest egg.
-Which leads me to speculate...

05:13.856 --> 05:17.693
...that he intends to strike an eagle's nest
somewhere here in Gotham City.

05:17.902 --> 05:19.403
- Do you agree, Robin?
-I agree.

05:19.612 --> 05:23.407
But there hasn't been an eagle
in Gotham City in 75 years.

05:23.616 --> 05:24.826
Except in a zoo.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.911
Perhaps not, Chief O'Hara...

05:27.119 --> 05:29.705
...but I know of at least one eagle's nest.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.207
Where's that, Batman?

05:31.415 --> 05:32.583
A nightclub.

05:32.792 --> 05:36.003
High atop the Gotham City State Building
known as the Aerie.

05:36.963 --> 05:39.799
Of course, the Aerie or eagle's nest.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.094
A favorite watering place
for Gotham City's elite.

05:43.302 --> 05:47.557
And a perfect target for an aquiline attack.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.725
Aquiline.

05:50.226 --> 05:53.479
That's a very descriptive word,
Commissioner Gordon.

05:53.688 --> 05:57.692
- Are you acquainted with its etymology, Robin?
-Aquiline. Of or like an eagle.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.736
- From aquila, Latin for eagle.
-Yes.

06:00.945 --> 06:05.366
And what Latin eagle now lives, resides...

06:05.575 --> 06:07.869
...or nests here in Gotham City?

06:08.077 --> 06:11.414
Anthony Aquila,
the exiled dictator from South America.

06:11.622 --> 06:15.459
And a multimillionaire who's rumored to keep
at least $1 million in cash...

06:15.668 --> 06:17.545
...in his wall safe at all times.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.755
That must be it, Batman.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.174
How could the Riddler resist
such a treasure.

06:22.717 --> 06:26.304
There's treasure at both ends of the rainbow,
commissioner.

06:26.470 --> 06:31.225
While Robin and I dash to Anthony Aquila's
palatial penthouse apartment...

06:31.434 --> 06:34.729
...you and your men in blue protect the area.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.522
An ingenious tactic.

06:36.731 --> 06:38.107
Thank you, commissioner.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.776
And good luck to all of us.

06:43.070 --> 06:47.283
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in Anthony Aquila's
palatial penthouse reproduction...</i>

06:47.491 --> 06:49.493
<i>...of his former plantation home...</i>

06:49.702 --> 06:54.081
<i>...the Riddler and his bearers
lurk in the underbrush.</i>

06:58.836 --> 07:01.881
Ha, ha. There it is, you nearsighted nitwits.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.092
The answer to a hard heart's dream.

07:05.301 --> 07:08.846
Don't stand there staring at it.
The loot sack, knaves.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.222
Ha.

07:12.183 --> 07:14.226
Fill it. Quickly.

07:20.733 --> 07:23.569
Riddler,
come out of the bush and surrender.

07:28.783 --> 07:30.576
As a duly deputized peace officer...

07:30.785 --> 07:33.287
...I order you to drop that sack
and give yourself up.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.997
Impossible.

07:35.206 --> 07:37.375
Fifteen feet of lethal quicksand.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.835
They sure don't look defunct to me, Riddler.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.129
Or demised, departed and dead.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.381
How?

07:43.965 --> 07:46.926
- How did they survive?
-Right was on our side, that's how.

07:48.678 --> 07:50.137
Get them.

08:13.202 --> 08:16.163
- The loot sack, Riddler.
-And then we'll talk about the money...

08:16.372 --> 08:19.583
...you took from the poor and needy.
-No, we don't, Boy Wonder.

08:19.792 --> 08:23.796
Because you and your deputized friend
are going to watch me walk out of here.

08:24.005 --> 08:27.591
Follow me and I'll show you why.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.226
At ease, old chum.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.062
I suspect Riddler's prisoner
is Senor Aquila himself.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.897
Brilliant deduction. Hold this.

08:42.857 --> 08:47.611
Yes, the eagle himself caged like a big bird.

08:47.820 --> 08:53.117
And, Batman, his life is in your hands.
Thank you.

08:53.868 --> 08:57.121
I prepared this tricky cage
in case the news report was true...

08:57.329 --> 08:58.748
...and you two showed up.

08:58.956 --> 09:03.627
In mere moments, an explosive charge
inside that ticking green box...

09:03.836 --> 09:07.006
...will send Senor Aquila
and his palatial penthouse...

09:07.214 --> 09:09.633
...higher than any eagle has ever flown.

09:13.763 --> 09:17.558
- Unless?
-Unless you and junior here...

09:17.767 --> 09:21.812
...unlock the secret to these battling bars
and disarm the bomb in time.

09:22.021 --> 09:23.355
<i>Well, adios, amigos.</i>

09:24.023 --> 09:26.942
Better get to work. Ta-ta.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.361
Are we going to let them walk out
just like that?

09:29.570 --> 09:30.738
We have no choice, Robin.

09:30.946 --> 09:35.493
Senor Aquila has many friends in his home
and we cannot risk an international incident.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.745
I suppose you're right.

09:37.953 --> 09:42.875
This particular puzzle cage doesn't seem
to conform with the usual puzzle cage pattern.

09:43.084 --> 09:47.338
Some of the medieval puzzle cages were
designed so that all the intersecting rods...

09:47.546 --> 09:52.218
...were dependent upon the access
of only one supporting rod.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.763
Disengaging that one rod...

10:00.226 --> 10:03.521
...unlocks the entire cage.
-Stand clear, Robin.

10:33.968 --> 10:36.303
Curious, but decidedly an explosive.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.056
"To whom it may concern.

10:40.975 --> 10:44.812
If the tail fits, wear it."

10:49.900 --> 10:51.569
There you are, professor.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.863
Three million dollars.

10:54.071 --> 10:58.450
I must admit, Mr. Riddler,
you are a man of your word.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.744
Where do we go
to pick up the demolecularizer?

11:00.953 --> 11:04.498
Oh, I have it with me at all times.

11:07.126 --> 11:09.837
- This is the demolecularizer?
-Mm-hm.

11:10.254 --> 11:14.383
You want me to pay $3 million
for an 89-cent pencil flashlight?

11:15.217 --> 11:20.264
That 89 cents pencil flashlight,
as you call it, Mr. Riddler...

11:20.472 --> 11:23.392
...is, in reality,
a highly sophisticated weapon...

11:23.601 --> 11:26.520
...which took a lifetime to develop.

11:26.729 --> 11:31.025
Powerful enough
to disrupt the molecular structure of matter...

11:31.233 --> 11:32.943
...yet so simply designed...

11:33.152 --> 11:39.533
...that it can be recharged by plugging it
in any household electrical outlet.

11:40.159 --> 11:41.243
How does it work?

11:42.077 --> 11:43.579
Um...

11:45.122 --> 11:48.083
Watch that, uh, green derby...

11:48.626 --> 11:50.502
...on that chair over there.

11:56.634 --> 11:57.968
Wow.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.723
It's gone.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.892
Disappeared.

12:06.185 --> 12:09.647
- That thing really works.
-As I said it would.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.983
Make it come back now.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.527
It isn't yet possible.

12:15.736 --> 12:22.159
I haven't even began work
on the molecular storer for lack of funds.

12:22.368 --> 12:27.831
Well, now you have $3 million...

12:29.083 --> 12:33.963
...and I have Gotham City right by the throat.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.843
Get Commissioner Gordon on the phone.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.596
He should be the first to know.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.788
Another crisis, commissioner?

13:07.997 --> 13:10.374
A rather enigmatic phone call
from the Riddler.

13:10.582 --> 13:14.044
Suggesting that we keep our eye
on Marshall Coley's statue.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.089
Do you think he would dare desecrate
the statue...

13:17.298 --> 13:19.800
...of our revered war hero
right here in Coley Square?

13:20.009 --> 13:24.972
A life of crime has worn the Riddler's moral
fiber to a frayed strand, commissioner.

13:25.180 --> 13:29.184
He may have little respect for the memory
of the great Marshall Coley.

13:38.569 --> 13:42.031
- This could be another of Riddler's ruses.
-Quite true, Robin.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.413
Holy Houdini.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.415
Great slithering snakes.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.126
The Marshall, he's gone.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.504
Uncanny.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.681
Careful, Chief O'Hara.

14:07.890 --> 14:12.394
Whatever unknown force was employed
in dematerializing Marshall Coley's statue...

14:12.603 --> 14:15.230
...may have left a contaminating residue
on the pedestal.

14:15.439 --> 14:18.108
Begorra, you're right.
Thanks, Caped Crusader.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.324
Someone here called "Batman"?

14:25.532 --> 14:26.617
Yes. I'm Batman.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.494
Telegram.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.634
Another Riddler-gram.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.014
It's an ultimatum.

14:49.223 --> 14:51.600
"Unless Gotham City
is declared an open city...

14:51.809 --> 14:55.896
...and all criminal statutes rescinded
within two hours...

14:56.105 --> 15:00.401
...police headquarters will disappear as surely
and as quickly as Marshall Coley's statue."

15:00.609 --> 15:02.361
That swaggering peacock.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.737
Oh, he's only bluffing.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.240
I'm afraid not, chief.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.991
Listen to this.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.204
"If the city fathers refuse to capitulate
after police headquarters is gone...

15:12.413 --> 15:18.460
...building after building will disappear
until they do."

15:21.463 --> 15:24.800
To confound us further,
the telegram ends with a riddle.

15:25.008 --> 15:28.262
"What is it that travels
on all fours in the morning...

15:28.470 --> 15:32.724
...on two legs at noon,
and three at twilight?

15:32.933 --> 15:37.896
If you intend to follow me,
add the answer to the other three."

15:38.689 --> 15:40.190
What can we do, Batman?

15:40.399 --> 15:42.901
It saddens me, commissioner...

15:43.777 --> 15:45.904
...but I just don't know.

15:52.327 --> 15:55.622
Gosh, Batman.
I'm sure hung-up on this riddle.

15:55.831 --> 16:00.461
I'll help you just as soon as I collate
these figures for the remote Bat Computer.

16:00.669 --> 16:05.257
Now, if my original premise was correct
and that machine has done a man's job...

16:05.466 --> 16:06.508
Man's job.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.760
Man's job.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.346
Man. That's it, Batman.

16:11.555 --> 16:14.057
Man travels on all fours
in the morning of his life...

16:14.266 --> 16:15.309
...or as an infant.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.645
And on two legs at noon or as an adult.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.523
And with a cane or three legs
in the twilight of his life.

16:21.732 --> 16:22.774
Congratulations, Robin.

16:22.983 --> 16:26.695
Now let's concentrate on the last part
of Riddler's challenge.

16:26.904 --> 16:30.866
"If you intend to follow me,
add the answer to the other three."

16:32.451 --> 16:36.413
We'll select the keywords
from each of the first three riddles.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.540
Page, banquet...

16:38.749 --> 16:40.918
...eagle's nest and man.

16:41.126 --> 16:45.881
For instance, the letter P in the word "page"
is the 16th letter in the alphabet.

16:46.089 --> 16:50.552
Using numerical positions in the alphabet
as a common denominator...

16:50.761 --> 16:55.390
...we then add the number two for banquet
and five for eagles--

16:55.599 --> 16:56.683
And 13 for man.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.727
And the total?

16:58.936 --> 17:01.688
- Thirty-six.
-Thirty-six.

17:02.856 --> 17:06.944
Thirty-six inches in a yard or three feet.

17:07.152 --> 17:10.280
And who has three feet to you?

17:10.696 --> 17:11.740
No one.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.537
Or no man.

17:17.246 --> 17:23.210
I seem to recall a recent announcement
of a factory opening by that name.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.296
Robin,
activate the remote Bat Computer again.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.475
"Noman Jigsaw Puzzle Factory."

17:38.684 --> 17:42.104
- On the corner of Shady Glade and Fifth.
-Excellent.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.275
- Commissioner?
-Yes, Batman.

17:46.483 --> 17:51.405
Could you arrange for the immediate delivery
of four 100-pound sacks of sodium dichloride...

17:51.613 --> 17:52.656
...to the Batcopter?

17:52.864 --> 17:53.907
I'll explain later.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.659
Consider it done. Anything else?

17:55.867 --> 18:02.249
Yes. Do not, I repeat, do not capitulate
to any of Riddler's demands...

18:02.457 --> 18:05.586
...until you hear from me
under any circumstances.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.504
You have my word on that too, Batman.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.047
Good.

18:10.173 --> 18:13.927
What are we gonna do with four 100-pound
sacks of sodium dichloride, Batman?

18:14.136 --> 18:16.346
Checkmate Riddler. Hopefully.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.768
<i>NARRATOR". While the Caped Crusaders
race against approaching doom...</i>

18:21.977 --> 18:27.107
<i>...their impatient adversary
frets away the remaining minutes.</i>

18:29.776 --> 18:34.114
How can you lamebrains play cards
in a time like this?

18:34.323 --> 18:37.618
Oh, gee, Riddler.
Honey, what else is there to do?

18:37.826 --> 18:39.536
Turn the television on.

18:39.745 --> 18:43.040
That fatheaded police commissioner
has little less than half an hour...

18:43.248 --> 18:45.834
...before he starts looking
for a new headquarters.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.964
<i>Chief O'Hara, I'm Bud Furillo
of the Gotham City Herald.</i>

18:51.173 --> 18:54.176
<i>Is there anything I can tell my readers
about your investigation?</i>

18:54.384 --> 18:57.137
<i>Well, we've moved every piece of furniture
in this building.</i>

18:57.346 --> 18:59.973
<i>We've looked under very rug,
but nothing could be found.</i>

19:00.182 --> 19:02.809
<i>What is it that you and your elite squad
are looking for?</i>

19:03.018 --> 19:04.394
<i>Well, we don't exactly know.</i>

19:04.603 --> 19:07.481
<i>But we'll keep right on looking
till the very last second.</i>

19:07.689 --> 19:09.358
<i>BUD".
Thank you, chief.</i>

19:09.566 --> 19:12.944
Poor Chief O'Hara, knocking himself out
looking all over the building...

19:13.111 --> 19:16.573
...for the demolecularizer when it's hidden
in the commissioner's office.

19:16.782 --> 19:18.659
- It is?
-When did you manage to do that?

19:18.867 --> 19:23.205
On my way back from Marshall Coley Square
I plugged it into an ordinary electrical outlet...

19:23.413 --> 19:27.209
...behind the commissioner's couch.
If the commissioner follows my instructions...

19:27.417 --> 19:31.129
...and issues a capitulation proclamation
in precisely 4:55 p.m...

19:31.338 --> 19:34.841
...I'll call him and tell him
how to deactivate the automatic trigger.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.469
- How?
-Simple.

19:37.678 --> 19:40.347
Turn the wall switch to the off position.

19:44.309 --> 19:47.729
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile,
the Dynamic Duo wings across the city...</i>

19:47.938 --> 19:51.900
<i>...with their cargo of sodium dichloride.</i>

19:57.572 --> 20:01.868
<i>The moment is almost at hand
now when the city must announce its decision.</i>

20:02.077 --> 20:06.415
<i>Capitulation will amount to official sanction
of wanton lawlessness.</i>

20:06.623 --> 20:10.210
<i>Standing fast
will prompt unholy destruction.</i>

20:10.419 --> 20:14.131
<i>We understand that Commissioner Gordon
has refused to leave the building.</i>

20:14.464 --> 20:16.007
Wonderful.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.844
Let him go down with his building.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.847
<i>There's very little time left now.</i>

20:29.604 --> 20:32.899
No time to use the stairs.
We'll have to try the Bat-rope.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.989
Stand clear.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.326
<i>MAN".
Our telephoto lens is providing the view...</i>

20:43.535 --> 20:46.204
...of <i>police headquarters
which you see on your screen.</i>

20:46.413 --> 20:48.373
<i>Except for Commissioner Gordon...</i>

20:48.582 --> 20:52.502
<i>...Chief O'Hara and his elite bomb squad,
the building is empty.</i>

20:53.003 --> 20:55.756
<i>All we can do is watch and wait.</i>

20:55.964 --> 21:00.135
Watch and wait, Gotham City.
There's more to come.

21:00.343 --> 21:01.636
<i>As the seconds tick away...</i>

21:01.803 --> 21:04.431
<i>...the clouds above police headquarters
seemed to be darkening...</i>

21:04.639 --> 21:06.600
...as <i>though</i> a <i>storm were imminent.</i>

21:07.559 --> 21:10.896
<i>Just five seconds to go. Four...</i>

21:11.563 --> 21:14.149
<i>...three, two...</i>

21:14.816 --> 21:16.359
<i>...one.</i>

21:19.988 --> 21:23.158
- What happened?
-The demolecularizer.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.618
It didn't work.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.871
I knew it was a cheap flashlight.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.164
Flashlight.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.208
Flashlight!

21:31.416 --> 21:33.668
- Try again.
-Didn't your mother ever tell you...

21:33.877 --> 21:37.798
...not to play with electricity?
-You two, how did you do it?

21:38.006 --> 21:40.550
The supercharged electrical power
of that lightning...

21:40.759 --> 21:43.011
...neutralized the effect of your weapon.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.389
How did you know the lightning
would strike at the right time?

21:46.598 --> 21:48.099
We arranged for it.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.351
Cloud seeding.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.853
With 400 pounds of sodium dichloride.

21:52.062 --> 21:54.189
Fortunately, my calculations proved correct.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.108
As usual, your riddles led us right to you.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.111
You've made the mistake
of being predictable yourselves...

22:00.320 --> 22:03.156
...with your legendary window entrances.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.699
Riddle me this.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.409
When is a floor...

22:06.618 --> 22:08.245
...like a puzzle?

22:29.307 --> 22:30.851
Help! Batman!

23:04.050 --> 23:07.846
- Nice catch, chief.
-Let go of me, you blue-footed baboon.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.765
I'll bet she's the toughest one of the bunch.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.226
- She's the only one still kicking.
-Ow!

23:20.233 --> 23:22.944
Coming forward voluntarily
with the stolen charity money...

23:23.153 --> 23:25.989
...should tip the scales of justice
in your favor, professor.

23:26.197 --> 23:30.619
No man can live with the wails
of the hungry children in his conscience.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.830
Professor,
when you've paid your debt to society...

23:34.039 --> 23:36.625
...you'll be able to continue
your scientific studies...

23:36.833 --> 23:41.630
...under the wing
of the Gotham City Science Institute.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.841
I don't know how to thank you, Batman...

23:45.050 --> 23:49.930
...for arranging my membership.
-You can thank our friend Bruce Wayne.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.890
Mr. Wayne persuaded the membership...

23:52.057 --> 23:54.976
...to lower the customary
educational requirements.

23:55.185 --> 23:59.105
Robin, we should take this money
to the Wayne Foundation...

23:59.314 --> 24:02.067
...before the close of business hours.
-Roger.

24:05.153 --> 24:07.614
Amazing man.

24:07.822 --> 24:11.660
Do you know who is under that mask
of his?

24:11.868 --> 24:14.079
To ask, professor, who he is...

24:14.287 --> 24:20.627
...is nowhere near as important
as where he is at all times.
