10:37.262 --> 10:38.628
I'm on your side.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.464
Cayden James is my target, too.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.557
I'm undercover with his organization.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.802
You think this "T" on my face
stands for "gullible"?

10:47.021 --> 10:48.057
You know what I mean.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.855
I tried telling Dinah last week,

10:49.941 --> 10:51.227
but she didn't give me the chance.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.735
Right now, James is killing
dozens of people.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.567
By tonight, it'll be hundreds.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.107
I need your help.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.785
Why should I trust you?

11:04.330 --> 11:07.494
Go to the subway tunnels where
the Red Line and the Gold Line cross.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.787
An hour from now.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.082
You might be able to save some lives.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.497
Or I could lead my teammates
into a trap.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.133
I could have trapped you here.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.381
But I didn't.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.691
Harold Grovner was
a dedicated civil servant.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.232
Who always wanted what was best
for this city

11:37.322 --> 11:38.654
and we will not forget that.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.233
But with everything
that is happening,

11:42.994 --> 11:46.112
we don't have the time
to mourn at the moment.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.489
So, please, let's get back to work.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.165
Becky, I need Councilmen Gattis,
McCaskell and Kullens,

11:53.254 --> 11:54.244
in that order please.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.500
Your 10:00 a.m. is here.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.841
I don't have a 10:00 a.m.
on my schedule, and even if I did...

11:59.969 --> 12:01.835
I think you'll find this one's
rather important.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.469
Ben Gayle, pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.391
Thanks for making the time.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.264
Thank you, Becky.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.933
I'll let you make the usual threats
in a minute.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.149
But before we get to that, you should
know that my colleagues are expecting

12:19.239 --> 12:20.901
to hear from me in six.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.822
And if they don't, well,

12:22.909 --> 12:26.949
you would be remiss in forgetting
the thermobaric explosive

12:27.163 --> 12:28.495
that remains in my possession.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.823
What do you want?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.536
I've already told you.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.461
Vengeance for my son.

12:43.304 --> 12:47.014
I cared for him, protected him,
loved him,

12:47.767 --> 12:49.508
just as you do this city.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.977
But now,

12:52.814 --> 12:56.398
your city's entire infrastructure
is under my control.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.982
Buildings, institutions, even people,

13:00.905 --> 13:02.646
all under my dominion.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.981
These are innocent people.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.816
And you can save them...

13:10.498 --> 13:13.991
By wiring $10 million
into that offshore account

13:15.545 --> 13:17.958
no later than 11:30 tonight.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.713
And every night.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.927
Until further notice.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.466
That will bankrupt us.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.018
Well, I certainly hope so.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.976
Please don't imagine that I've gone
to these lengths for money.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.977
No, this is for you.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.187
So that you'll suffer.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.644
I didn't kill your son.

13:42.739 --> 13:46.858
Yes, you did. One year ago,

13:46.951 --> 13:48.362
this very day,

13:48.453 --> 13:50.285
right here in Star City.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.493
You missed your intended target,

13:53.583 --> 13:56.451
but your arrow found its way
into my boy.

13:59.464 --> 14:03.504
Are you seeking vengeance?
If you want revenge,

14:06.220 --> 14:08.553
why haven't you just outed me
as the Green Arrow?

14:08.973 --> 14:10.714
If my understanding is correct,

14:11.225 --> 14:12.682
that's already been done.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.937
Star City will not negotiate
with a terrorist.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.190
Oh, spare me the political claptrap,
Mr. Queen.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.485
By tonight,
that will sound hollow even to you.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.702
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

14:41.214 --> 14:42.330
You okay?

14:42.423 --> 14:44.540
I have tried every trick

14:44.884 --> 14:46.750
to counter-hack what Cayden is doing,

14:47.178 --> 14:48.794
and I am completely boxed out.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.387
So I contacted Alena
to help me figure out why

14:51.474 --> 14:53.807
and the answer is,
is that it's my fault.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.676
Felicity, what are you talking about?

14:55.770 --> 14:58.308
When we stopped Cayden and Laurel
from blowing up the Internet vault?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.479
Uh-huh.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.556
That was all a ruse.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.605
Cayden just wanted us to think
that people were in trouble

15:03.694 --> 15:05.936
so that I would break through
his firewall,

15:06.030 --> 15:09.865
but instead of blocking him, I was
actually helping him plant a virus.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.908
Now he has complete control
of the entire city.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.825
The hackcident is killing
one person every 18 minutes

15:15.915 --> 15:17.577
and I have no idea how to stop it.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.657
I do.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.289
Thanks to Cayden James,
who was kind enough

15:21.379 --> 15:22.870
to pay me a visit at City Hall.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.297
- What did he want?
- He wants $10 million a day.

15:26.551 --> 15:30.295
That's not the actual part. He told
me the details of his son's death.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.254
He was killed one year ago today.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.598
Cayden thinks that he was
collateral damage from a fight

15:34.684 --> 15:35.970
that I had in Star City.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.476
It's not possible.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.304
You were in Hub City
recruiting Dinah.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.388
Yup.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.060
If Cayden James is motivated
by revenge,

15:43.151 --> 15:44.437
maybe we can get him to stand down.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.311
Oh, I like that idea, because I have
no way of stopping him my way,

15:47.405 --> 15:49.738
and I have no location for you
to find him your way.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.781
Felicity, we need
incontrovertible proof.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.825
Yeah, I know. I'm on it.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.074
DINAH: I can't believe
we didn't catch Vincent.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.202
He had a 20-minute lead on us.

16:00.710 --> 16:01.700
Where have you been?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.706

- Lucky guess.
- You want backup?

16:24.275 --> 16:27.063
Felicity, I appreciate the intel, but
we're not working together anymore.

so let's go.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.788
This is the city's

16:43.878 --> 16:46.165

that have happened so far.

A lot around the edges.
The train lines and the freeways.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.170
He's laying siege to the city.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.751
It's probably why he wanted the port.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.835
It's exactly what he's doing.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.011
He wants to block off
all the exit routes.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.301
And stop all the reinforcements
from the outside.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.725
Any roads he hasn't hit yet?

17:00.186 --> 17:03.099
Yeah, there's one exit left under
the city and it's the tunnel.

from Vincent Sobel.

23:17.354 --> 23:20.392
- I'm sorry, what?
- I didn't trust him at first either.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.980
Okay, but I called Felicity
to confirm if his intel checked out,

23:24.069 --> 23:25.435
and it did, clearly.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.234
And that's why you were late
getting back here earlier,

23:28.324 --> 23:29.485
you were talking to him?

23:29.783 --> 23:32.321
So, you didn't bother telling us?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.822
How very Oliver Queen of you.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.451
CURTIS: I had to get all the information
first before I looped you guys in.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.532
Then once I did
have all the information,

23:38.626 --> 23:40.037
we had to stop a subway collision.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.127
But we did, and now here I am,
telling you guys.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.579
Telling us what?

23:45.716 --> 23:46.957
Why would Vince help us?

23:47.426 --> 23:48.758
He says he's a double agent working

23:48.844 --> 23:50.676
to take down Cayden James
from the inside.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.298
I mean, that does track,
and the guy used to be undercover.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.054
Which makes him a professional liar.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.013
He's had so many opportunities
to tell me he's a double agent.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.144
Why hasn't he? He just somehow forgot
to mention it?

24:04.234 --> 24:05.224
He says he tried to.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.987
That is absolute crap.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.239
Maybe. But if he
turns out to be legit,

24:11.325 --> 24:14.238
he could offer a tactical advantage
that we can't turn down.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.946
Well, I can, because I will
never work with him again, ever.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.490
Well, obviously Curtis
and I disagree, so...

24:20.668 --> 24:21.658
So nothing.

24:23.629 --> 24:27.043
We all have to agree. Don't we?

24:42.648 --> 24:43.729
- Okay.
- Great, thank you.

Worse still, I got cops standing
around here doing nothing

25:02.042 --> 25:03.453
when they could be out there
helping people.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.001
I'd like to redeploy them.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.204
No. If we get people here,

25:07.297 --> 25:09.163
then we don't need to worry
about protecting them out there.

is going to attack next.

- You got something?

25:28.068 --> 25:29.058
Bull's-eye.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.852
Alena remembered that last May,

25:30.946 --> 25:32.232
Cayden received a package
from Corto Maltese

25:32.322 --> 25:33.312
and she thinks that in that package

25:33.407 --> 25:35.569
was the evidence that made Cayden
think that Oliver killed Owen.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.320
And how exactly is that a bull's-eye?

25:37.411 --> 25:38.743
Because we know Oliver
didn't kill Owen.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.995
So whatever was in that package,
that evidence...

25:41.081 --> 25:43.368
That evidence had to have been
faked somehow.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.909
- Bull's-eye. Boom.
- All right.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.288
You okay?

25:49.882 --> 25:52.545
Yeah. Yeah, it's just stupid.

Well, you don't do stupid, so?

25:56.597 --> 25:58.179
I don't know. I was just hoping that

25:59.099 --> 26:01.261

so well, that maybe...

26:01.351 --> 26:02.341

- Yeah.

thing is dealt with.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.098
Hope so.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.853
Hope so for his sake.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.068
Oh, man, he just found out that his
father has been lying to him

26:16.158 --> 26:17.148
for a month.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.826
I've been trying to work up the
courage to talk to him, but like...

Mr. James has made his demands,
but make no mistake,

27:05.958 --> 27:07.199
he is a terrorist

with terrorists.

On Cayden James' son?

28:21.283 --> 28:23.491
So Alena thinks that Cayden believes
that you killed his son

28:23.577 --> 28:26.695
because of something that arrived in
a package from Corto Maltese in May.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.447
Through a pretty close sequence
of hacks on the mail systems

28:29.541 --> 28:31.624

not that you need to know about it

28:31.710 --> 28:32.996
but it was really intense
and really cool

and I did it, it was really hard.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.003

In that package was a USB drive,

28:36.089 --> 28:37.671
we actually have that USB drive's
serial number,

so Alena is just working on trying
to find the computer in Corto Maltese

28:39.927 --> 28:41.919
that uploaded the information
onto that drive that Cayden received.

28:42.346 --> 28:45.589
The information that made him think
that you killed his son.

Well, let's break it down.
You know, pro/con style.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.180
All right.

29:36.900 --> 29:41.520
Pro, he's really good and he gets
deep into his assignments.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.941
Con, on our last assignment
he got in too deep.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.364
He can forget what side he's on.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.989
Pro, he's in with Cayden James
and his crew.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.704
and his last intel worked.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.501
If you didn't know Vincent,

29:57.963 --> 30:00.580
if you could remove
this history with him...

30:01.341 --> 30:04.584
If, as a cop, he came to you
with some intel,

30:05.304 --> 30:06.511
what would your gut tell you?

30:07.055 --> 30:10.014
- Do we have new intel from him?
- No.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.763
Then I'm not going
to answer that yet.

30:20.319 --> 30:24.233
You know, there's, um,
a study I was reading

30:24.323 --> 30:29.614
that was saying that actually talking
to a child is one of the most

30:29.703 --> 30:31.615
effective parenting techniques.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.493
- No kidding. Is that true?
- Yeah.

30:35.751 --> 30:39.495
Well, I have learned several times
the hard way that

30:40.630 --> 30:42.963
sometimes kids just
want to be left alone.

30:45.218 --> 30:48.256
I know I have to talk to him.
I'm just trying to respect that.

totally be projecting here...

to live his life,

31:07.032 --> 31:08.489
