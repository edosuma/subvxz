00:09.430 --> 00:12.150
<b>That is most likely a Conjurer's work.</b>

00:12.150 --> 00:14.050
<b>Yeah, that's gotta be it.</b>

00:14.750 --> 00:17.060
<b>These buildings weren't here yesterday.</b>

00:19.490 --> 00:21.470
<b>This has to be <i>Nen</i>.</b>

00:22.120 --> 00:24.840
<b>Man, these guys are really crazy...</b>

00:25.610 --> 00:28.420
<b>They have someone who can 
conjure entire buildings!</b>

00:28.420 --> 00:31.170
<b>It's safe to assume that 
they're rigged somehow.</b>

00:31.170 --> 00:32.160
<b>Yeah.</b>

00:32.160 --> 00:35.180
<b>That tells us they're still using 
this place as their base.</b>

00:35.880 --> 00:36.980
<b>The problem is</b>

00:36.980 --> 00:40.170
<b>that these buildings create 
too many blind spots.</b>

00:40.610 --> 00:43.680
<b>I can only watch twenty 
percent of the area at a time.</b>

00:43.680 --> 00:44.780
<b>However,</b>

00:44.780 --> 00:48.280
<b>if you move around too much, 
you could run into one of them.</b>

00:48.280 --> 00:49.940
<b>I'd like to avoid that.</b>

00:50.530 --> 00:51.540
<b>I mean,</b>

00:51.540 --> 00:55.020
<b>I have no idea what I'd do if I 
heard their voices behind me...</b>

00:55.020 --> 00:57.200
<b>My heart is pounding.</b>

00:58.020 --> 00:59.480
<b>Voices?</b>

00:59.480 --> 01:00.200
<b>Huh?</b>

01:00.460 --> 01:02.410
<b>Oh, never mind. I read you.</b>

01:02.410 --> 01:05.230
<b>For now, return to your original position.</b>

01:05.230 --> 01:06.900
<b>I'll call you back in five minutes.</b>

01:09.090 --> 01:10.600
<b>Hello? Melody?</b>

01:10.600 --> 01:11.960
<b>How's it going on your side?</b>

01:11.960 --> 01:13.950
<b>We're still shopping.</b>

01:13.050 --> 01:14.670
<b>Let me see that one.</b>

01:13.950 --> 01:16.560
<b>This might be harder than 
regular bodyguard work.</b>

01:16.080 --> 01:17.920
<b>It's not too bad...</b>

01:16.960 --> 01:18.900
<b>Basho's about to snap.</b>

01:19.550 --> 01:21.770
<b>Let's go back to the other store.</b>

01:21.770 --> 01:23.220
<b>Yes, I know.</b>

02:45.010 --> 02:50.060
<b>Beloved x And x Beleaguered</b>

02:51.820 --> 02:55.190
<b>You've already told me everything that Uvo</b>

02:55.670 --> 02:57.640
<b>knew about the chain user?</b>

02:57.640 --> 03:00.250
<b>Yeah, when we were investigating</b>

03:00.250 --> 03:03.110
<b>the Nostrade Family using the Hunter website,</b>

03:03.110 --> 03:07.580
<b>Uvo pointed to three members at the top.</b>

03:08.290 --> 03:12.960
<b>It was late night on the 1st when we realized 
they were the daughter's bodyguards.</b>

03:13.430 --> 03:16.460
<b>And I met that daughter yesterday.</b>

03:16.800 --> 03:20.560
<b>And that's when you stole her power.</b>

03:20.560 --> 03:21.470
<b>Yeah.</b>

03:22.120 --> 03:25.470
<b>And here is an updated list of bodyguards.</b>

03:25.820 --> 03:27.850
<b>There are two new members.</b>

03:27.850 --> 03:29.180
<b>Wow.</b>

03:29.180 --> 03:32.050
<b>They already have new information up?</b>

03:32.050 --> 03:34.280
<b>Seven bodyguards...</b>

03:34.280 --> 03:36.050
<b>Perhaps more.</b>

03:36.690 --> 03:39.460
<b>That's a lot of people to guard one girl.</b>

03:39.460 --> 03:40.990
<b>He must love his daughter.</b>

03:41.530 --> 03:45.490
<b>He probably cares more about her ability.</b>

03:46.030 --> 03:50.480
<b>Her father achieved his current 
status by using her power.</b>

03:51.180 --> 03:54.380
<b>There are many who resent his advancement.</b>

03:54.990 --> 03:57.920
<b>But why did she come to Yorknew City?</b>

03:58.380 --> 04:00.380
<b>For the auction, I'd imagine.</b>

04:04.590 --> 04:05.720
<b>Boss?</b>

04:05.720 --> 04:07.930
<b>Shizuku, Pakunoda...</b>

04:07.930 --> 04:08.750
<b>Yes?</b>

04:09.580 --> 04:10.670
<b>Nice...</b>

04:11.440 --> 04:13.140
<b>Actually, I'm an idiot.</b>

04:13.640 --> 04:15.940
<b>Damn, what's wrong with me?</b>

04:16.540 --> 04:21.320
<b>If I'd stopped to consider why their 
boss's daughter is in Yorknew City,</b>

04:21.820 --> 04:25.450
<b>we could have found the chain user sooner.</b>

04:26.210 --> 04:29.420
<b>It's safe to assume that this 
girl came to Yorknew City</b>

04:30.140 --> 04:32.200
<b>for the auction.</b>

04:32.820 --> 04:36.700
<b>I was too focused on her fortunetelling 
to give any regard to that.</b>

04:37.360 --> 04:39.140
<b>According to the website,</b>

04:39.140 --> 04:43.370
<b>this girl also collects body parts.</b>

04:43.720 --> 04:44.910
<b>Body parts...</b>

04:45.460 --> 04:46.470
<b>The Scarlet Eyes!</b>

04:46.880 --> 04:47.750
<b>Yes.</b>

04:48.360 --> 04:52.220
<b>The chain user joined the 
Nostrade Family for a reason.</b>

04:52.590 --> 04:56.130
<b>He knew that the Scarlet Eyes 
would be sold at the auction,</b>

04:56.130 --> 04:59.720
<b>and that Nostrade's daughter 
would be interested in them.</b>

05:01.100 --> 05:03.290
<b>The chain user desires two things.</b>

05:03.290 --> 05:06.580
<b>To exact revenge upon us, 
and to recover his people's eyes.</b>

05:07.150 --> 05:10.990
<b>Shal, were we able to steal the Scarlet Eyes?</b>

05:11.240 --> 05:13.410
<b>Sorry, I'm not sure.</b>

05:13.410 --> 05:17.250
<b>I had the auctioneer running on 
autopilot throughout the auction.</b>

05:17.610 --> 05:21.010
<b>Kortopi, do you remember 
copying the Scarlet Eyes?</b>

05:21.390 --> 05:22.880
<b>I copied them.</b>

05:23.180 --> 05:25.590
<b>Your copies function as <i>En</i>.</b>

05:26.140 --> 05:28.130
<b>Can you tell where the copy is?</b>

05:28.770 --> 05:30.290
<b>If I'm touching the real one.</b>

05:34.960 --> 05:36.040
<b>Found them.</b>

05:44.690 --> 05:45.920
<b>Got it.</b>

05:45.920 --> 05:47.660
<b>There's something of the same shape</b>

05:47.660 --> 05:51.160
<b>approximately 2,500 meters in that direction.</b>

05:52.430 --> 05:54.660
<b><i>Is the chain user there?</i></b>

05:54.970 --> 05:56.630
<b>We should hurry.</b>

05:56.630 --> 05:59.130
<b>The <i>En</i> effect will fade in a few hours.</b>

05:59.630 --> 06:00.920
<b>Do you have a map?</b>

06:02.500 --> 06:03.370
<b>Here.</b>

06:04.500 --> 06:06.850
<b>North-northwest...</b>

06:06.850 --> 06:08.270
<b>2,500 meters.</b>

06:09.390 --> 06:10.940
<b>Hotel Beitacle.</b>

06:12.050 --> 06:13.320
<b>Boss...</b>

06:13.860 --> 06:15.680
<b>Let me go.</b>

06:15.680 --> 06:17.180
<b>Please.</b>

06:20.940 --> 06:22.060
<b>Very well.</b>

06:22.650 --> 06:24.360
<b>But I shall accompany you.</b>

06:24.360 --> 06:25.470
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

06:25.470 --> 06:27.070
<b>Paku, Machi, Shizuku,</b>

06:27.340 --> 06:28.740
<b>you're coming, too.</b>

06:29.150 --> 06:31.100
<b>Shal, you'll switch with Kortopi.</b>

06:31.100 --> 06:32.210
<b>Okay.</b>

06:35.980 --> 06:36.900
<b>Hello?</b>

06:36.900 --> 06:38.490
<b>Oh, Killua-kun?</b>

06:38.490 --> 06:40.260
<b>Yeah, who are you?</b>

06:40.260 --> 06:42.060
<b>One of Kurapika's colleagues.</b>

06:42.060 --> 06:43.820
<b>Could you look to your left?</b>

06:47.640 --> 06:49.120
<b>Hang up,</b>

06:49.120 --> 06:52.470
<b>and then whisper a command to me.</b>

06:54.170 --> 06:55.470
<b>Raise your right hand.</b>

06:57.690 --> 06:59.830
<b><i>Her ears are super sharp!</i></b>

06:59.830 --> 07:01.300
<b><i>We can use this to our advantage.</i></b>

07:07.130 --> 07:08.320
<b>What?</b>

07:08.320 --> 07:10.490
<b>Didn't we already try this place before?</b>

07:10.770 --> 07:12.530
<b>Hotel Beitacle is one of the places</b>

07:12.530 --> 07:15.560
<b>where the Nostrade Family is staying.</b>

07:15.560 --> 07:19.360
<b>Yeah, but when Shal checked the website,</b>

07:19.360 --> 07:21.120
<b>they'd already checked out.</b>

07:21.120 --> 07:24.570
<b>They probably checked into that 
hotel under a different name.</b>

07:24.570 --> 07:26.400
<b>They're being cautious.</b>

07:28.550 --> 07:31.130
<b>The rain keeps me from 
hearing what's being said,</b>

07:31.130 --> 07:33.560
<b>but people are talking over there.</b>

07:34.020 --> 07:37.390
<b>Judging by the footsteps, 
five or six, including women.</b>

07:37.740 --> 07:40.760
<b>They're heading in the opposite 
direction from those ruined buildings.</b>

07:40.760 --> 07:42.330
<b>That's amazing.</b>

07:42.330 --> 07:45.720
<b>Gon and I have trained hard, 
but I can't hear a thing.</b>

07:45.720 --> 07:47.400
<b>This happens to be my power.</b>

07:48.620 --> 07:51.580
<b>Kurapika must be getting desperate...</b>

07:51.580 --> 07:54.410
<b>He actually asked me for help.</b>

07:54.410 --> 07:55.060
<b>Huh?</b>

07:55.510 --> 07:58.510
<b>He wants to do everything himself, right?</b>

07:58.510 --> 07:59.720
<b>Oh...</b>

07:59.720 --> 08:01.410
<b>Yeah, that's true.</b>

08:02.800 --> 08:05.670
<b>Are you an assassin?</b>

08:05.970 --> 08:07.090
<b>I used to be.</b>

08:07.090 --> 08:08.420
<b>How did you know?</b>

08:08.420 --> 08:09.550
<b>Your footsteps.</b>

08:10.380 --> 08:13.070
<b>You're right next to me, but they're estinto.</b>

08:13.530 --> 08:14.430
<b>Es-what?</b>

08:14.730 --> 08:15.890
<b>Estinto...</b>

08:15.890 --> 08:18.680
<b>A music term meaning barely audible.</b>

08:19.310 --> 08:23.200
<b>Oh, I'm in the habit of moving 
without making any sound.</b>

08:23.200 --> 08:26.120
<b>You have the quietest step I've ever heard.</b>

08:26.120 --> 08:27.690
<b>Your technique is impressive.</b>

08:28.030 --> 08:31.190
<b>I can see why Kurapika would rely on you.</b>

08:32.190 --> 08:34.950
<b>Well, I'm not too thrilled about this.</b>

08:34.950 --> 08:36.820
<b>Oh? Really?</b>

08:37.690 --> 08:38.700
<b>Stop.</b>

08:41.050 --> 08:45.790
<b>They're one hundred meters 
around the next corner.</b>

08:46.180 --> 08:48.260
<b>You can pick out their footsteps?</b>

08:48.260 --> 08:51.300
<b>Everyone's are slightly different.</b>

08:51.730 --> 08:52.840
<b>Oh...</b>

08:52.840 --> 08:54.060
<b>I'll take a look.</b>

08:57.150 --> 08:58.270
<b>Killua?</b>

08:58.270 --> 08:59.620
<b>The woman's here.</b>

09:00.390 --> 09:01.790
<b>She's with her buddies.</b>

09:01.790 --> 09:03.380
<b>There are six, moving together.</b>

09:03.800 --> 09:05.130
<b>That topknot guy's here, too.</b>

09:06.020 --> 09:07.280
<b>One more thing.</b>

09:07.690 --> 09:09.910
<b>There's one person that 
wasn't there yesterday.</b>

09:10.890 --> 09:13.700
<b>He's probably the leader.</b>

09:13.700 --> 09:14.820
<b>Can you describe him?</b>

09:15.260 --> 09:16.980
<b>He's wearing a black coat,</b>

09:16.980 --> 09:19.070
<b>with St. Peter's cross on the back.</b>

09:19.460 --> 09:20.970
<b>He has combed-back black hair.</b>

09:21.610 --> 09:22.950
<b>I can't see his face.</b>

09:23.580 --> 09:25.210
<b>And they're too alert!</b>

09:25.620 --> 09:27.630
<b>I'm too afraid to circle around in front.</b>

09:28.160 --> 09:29.350
<b>Let me speak to him.</b>

09:29.350 --> 09:30.660
<b>Where are you now?</b>

09:30.660 --> 09:32.070
<b>In front of the Motoba Building.</b>

09:32.070 --> 09:34.590
<b>They're walking west, 
on Continental Street.</b>

09:34.590 --> 09:35.910
<b>There's a station nearby.</b>

09:35.910 --> 09:37.410
<b>Can you make it onto their train?</b>

09:37.720 --> 09:39.350
<b>It depends on the circumstances.</b>

09:39.350 --> 09:40.720
<b>If it's busy, I can manage.</b>

09:41.300 --> 09:43.160
<b>Leorio, take us south.</b>

09:43.160 --> 09:44.210
<b>Okay!</b>

09:49.890 --> 09:52.480
<b>Melody's in the same car as they are.</b>

09:53.040 --> 09:54.860
<b>This train's headed toward Castor.</b>

09:55.260 --> 09:56.870
<b>I'm in the last car.</b>

09:57.740 --> 09:59.320
<b>Castor...</b>

09:59.320 --> 10:01.490
<b>The auction site's that way.</b>

10:01.970 --> 10:04.780
<b>So is our hotel...</b>

10:06.380 --> 10:07.860
<b>Yeah. Yeah.</b>

10:07.860 --> 10:10.050
<b>I know, Eliza.</b>

10:10.050 --> 10:12.880
<b>I'm sick of this job!</b>

10:13.300 --> 10:16.070
<b>I should be happy I get to 
spend time with the dogs?</b>

10:16.070 --> 10:20.390
<b>Well, it beats taking care of 
that spoiled brat, I guess.</b>

10:20.390 --> 10:22.190
<b>I'm fond of Neon-sama,</b>

10:22.190 --> 10:23.950
<b>but she's too active for me.</b>

10:23.950 --> 10:25.400
<b>Look at this, Eliza!</b>

10:25.400 --> 10:26.890
<b>It's so cute!</b>

10:29.320 --> 10:31.930
<b>Well, hang in there a little longer.</b>

10:31.930 --> 10:33.580
<b>I'll find a better job soon enough...</b>

10:38.280 --> 10:39.500
<b>Who's there?</b>

10:39.500 --> 10:41.420
<b>Room service.</b>

10:41.420 --> 10:43.280
<b>Leave it in front of the door.</b>

11:02.650 --> 11:04.180
<b>Okay, let's eat.</b>

11:05.180 --> 11:08.720
<b>Man, I seriously need to 
find a different job...</b>

11:08.720 --> 11:11.250
<b>I don't have the energy for this.</b>

11:11.250 --> 11:16.070
<b>But I need a job that will support 
Eliza and these guys...</b>

11:16.280 --> 11:18.710
<b>That's hard to find...</b>

11:20.930 --> 11:21.570
<b>Huh?</b>

11:23.540 --> 11:24.890
<b>Don't worry.</b>

11:24.890 --> 11:26.550
<b>I'll figure something out.</b>

11:42.160 --> 11:43.050
<b><i>They got off?</i></b>

11:43.860 --> 11:45.850
<b>They got off at Liber Station.</b>

11:45.850 --> 11:48.310
<b>They're headed toward the 
Saloma Department Store exit.</b>

11:48.310 --> 11:49.610
<b>That's not good.</b>

11:49.610 --> 11:50.910
<b>The hotel's that way.</b>

11:52.310 --> 11:53.310
<b>Seriously?!</b>

11:53.310 --> 11:55.310
<b>They know we switched rooms?</b>

11:55.860 --> 11:58.050
<b>Damn, this isn't funny!</b>

11:58.050 --> 11:59.820
<b>We need to escape fast!</b>

12:01.100 --> 12:03.280
<b><i>I have to bring these.</i></b>

12:04.730 --> 12:06.050
<b>The station's over there.</b>

12:06.050 --> 12:08.050
<b>Shouldn't we get closer?</b>

12:08.050 --> 12:08.870
<b>No.</b>

12:09.290 --> 12:10.940
<b>If we get any closer,</b>

12:10.940 --> 12:13.900
<b>they might sense my animosity.</b>

12:14.200 --> 12:15.130
<b>Gon,</b>

12:15.130 --> 12:16.790
<b>the range I should stay at</b>

12:16.790 --> 12:19.290
<b>is the distance from here 
to the station entrance.</b>

12:19.290 --> 12:22.670
<b>I must attack from this distance 
if I don't want to be noticed.</b>

12:23.300 --> 12:27.300
<b>It will take approximately 0.5 
seconds to land an attack.</b>

12:27.800 --> 12:31.120
<b>That's more than enough 
time for them to evade it.</b>

12:31.630 --> 12:33.990
<b>Unless they're distracted...</b>

12:44.730 --> 12:45.680
<b>Spiders!</b>

12:48.430 --> 12:49.390
<b>They're on the move.</b>

12:50.170 --> 12:51.750
<b>Descending slowly.</b>

12:52.600 --> 12:54.000
<b>An elevator.</b>

12:54.000 --> 12:55.500
<b>Are they going out?</b>

12:55.500 --> 12:57.080
<b>We should hurry, boss.</b>

12:57.640 --> 12:59.720
<b>We'll apprehend him as a group.</b>

13:00.030 --> 13:02.170
<b>Stay close enough to provide assistance.</b>

13:02.800 --> 13:03.870
<b>Pakunoda,</b>

13:03.870 --> 13:06.430
<b>once we capture him, 
get the information on Uvo.</b>

13:06.820 --> 13:07.630
<b>Got it.</b>

13:08.400 --> 13:10.190
<b>After that, Nobunaga,</b>

13:10.190 --> 13:11.550
<b>he's all yours.</b>

13:13.780 --> 13:14.600
<b>Go!</b>

13:16.380 --> 13:17.700
<b>They're running toward the hotel.</b>

13:17.700 --> 13:18.480
<b>They're fast!</b>

13:18.480 --> 13:20.470
<b>Can we get there faster by car?</b>

13:20.470 --> 13:22.330
<b>It's rush hour.</b>

13:22.330 --> 13:25.150
<b>They might be faster on foot.</b>

13:25.490 --> 13:26.510
<b>Kurapika!</b>

13:26.510 --> 13:28.870
<b>Wait here until I contact you.</b>

13:29.150 --> 13:30.570
<b>Wait, Kurapika...</b>

13:30.570 --> 13:32.000
<b>I have a good idea.</b>

13:32.000 --> 13:33.370
<b>Kurapika!</b>

13:34.850 --> 13:37.160
<b>Melody and I are at the station entrance.</b>

13:37.160 --> 13:40.000
<b>Those six ran off to the northwest.</b>

13:40.000 --> 13:42.040
<b>Yeah, I'm following them!</b>

13:42.040 --> 13:44.150
<b>Wait, you're running after them?</b>

13:44.150 --> 13:45.010
<b>That's dangerous!</b>

13:45.450 --> 13:46.730
<b>They'll notice you!</b>

13:46.730 --> 13:47.870
<b>Stop it!</b>

13:48.740 --> 13:49.800
<b>Hey!</b>

13:49.800 --> 13:52.510
<b>The bastard hung up on me...</b>

14:00.760 --> 14:02.610
<b>Wow! What's that?</b>

14:03.970 --> 14:05.800
<b>They're ninjas...</b>

14:07.220 --> 14:10.370
<b>Target moving forty kilometers 
per hour, in a 2:00 direction.</b>

14:10.740 --> 14:11.990
<b>He got in a vehicle.</b>

14:14.290 --> 14:17.170
<b>I was going to wait until I found another job,</b>

14:17.170 --> 14:18.370
<b>but that's no longer an option.</b>

14:18.790 --> 14:20.060
<b>I'm quitting today!</b>

14:21.600 --> 14:23.250
<b>Leorio, where's Gon?</b>

14:23.250 --> 14:25.470
<b>He ran after Kurapika.</b>

14:25.470 --> 14:29.010
<b>I was told to wait, 
but I can't just sit around.</b>

14:29.010 --> 14:33.130
<b>I'm driving to Hotel Beitacle, 
but I'm stuck in traffic!</b>

14:34.880 --> 14:36.020
<b>Fine!</b>

14:36.380 --> 14:38.030
<b>We're going after Kurapika!</b>

14:38.030 --> 14:39.020
<b>Seriously...</b>

14:39.020 --> 14:41.740
<b>These people just do whatever 
the hell they want!</b>

14:43.870 --> 14:45.280
<b>We're being followed.</b>

14:46.120 --> 14:47.310
<b>When did that happen?</b>

14:47.310 --> 14:48.100
<b>Oops.</b>

14:48.100 --> 14:50.030
<b>I was too focused on chasing the target.</b>

14:50.030 --> 14:52.780
<b>Is the chain user behind or in front of us?</b>

14:52.780 --> 14:56.210
<b>Nobunaga, Pakunoda, and Kortopi, 
pursue the target ahead.</b>

14:56.210 --> 14:57.090
<b>Roger that.</b>

15:08.400 --> 15:09.520
<b>Did you see them?</b>

15:09.520 --> 15:10.700
<b>I only caught a silhouette.</b>

15:10.700 --> 15:13.260
<b>I couldn't see their faces, 
but one is in the alley.</b>

15:13.260 --> 15:15.140
<b>Another is behind the dumpster.</b>

15:15.140 --> 15:16.250
<b>Okay.</b>

15:16.250 --> 15:17.820
<b>Keep using <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

15:17.820 --> 15:18.680
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

15:28.960 --> 15:30.420
<b><i>Spiders...</i></b>

15:30.420 --> 15:31.700
<b><i>Come and get it!</i></b>

15:31.700 --> 15:33.200
<b><i>Stop it, Kurapika.</i></b>

15:33.200 --> 15:37.330
<b><i>We can't fight three of them</i></b>

15:37.330 --> 15:38.810
<b><i>if they know we're here!</i></b>

15:41.090 --> 15:43.080
<b><i>Okay, then it's all or nothing.</i></b>

15:45.550 --> 15:46.340
<b><i>Gon?!</i></b>

15:46.340 --> 15:47.630
<b>Sorry!</b>

15:47.630 --> 15:50.210
<b>I'll stop following, so can you let me go?</b>

15:50.210 --> 15:51.480
<b>Him again?</b>

15:52.010 --> 15:54.850
<b>This is the boy he mentioned?</b>

15:55.270 --> 15:56.970
<b>The other one's here, too.</b>

15:57.350 --> 15:58.340
<b>Show yourself.</b>

16:01.750 --> 16:03.150
<b>What do you want?</b>

16:03.150 --> 16:05.810
<b>The Mafia who put a reward on us are gone.</b>

16:05.810 --> 16:07.590
<b>Wh-What? Really?</b>

16:07.590 --> 16:08.570
<b>Why?</b>

16:15.110 --> 16:17.060
<b>What do we do, boss?</b>

16:17.060 --> 16:18.180
<b>Tie them up.</b>

16:19.580 --> 16:21.070
<b>Phinks? It's me.</b>

16:22.200 --> 16:24.330
<b>I need you to come to the Beitacle Hotel.</b>

16:25.490 --> 16:27.720
<b>Shouldn't we just kill them?</b>

16:27.720 --> 16:30.360
<b>No, I trust your instincts.</b>

16:31.020 --> 16:33.740
<b>If they're connected to the 
chain user somehow,</b>

16:33.740 --> 16:35.430
<b>we should keep them alive.</b>

16:35.920 --> 16:38.150
<b>I wouldn't trust my instincts...</b>

16:38.890 --> 16:41.010
<b>I have a question for you.</b>

16:42.400 --> 16:45.310
<b>How can you kill people who 
have nothing to do with you?</b>

16:56.530 --> 16:58.680
<b>You look pretty hostile,</b>

16:58.680 --> 17:00.830
<b>considering that you just surrendered.</b>

17:03.550 --> 17:05.070
<b>Why, indeed?</b>

17:05.530 --> 17:07.350
<b>Because they have nothing to do with us?</b>

17:07.830 --> 17:08.460
<b>No.</b>

17:08.990 --> 17:11.750
<b>On second thought, it isn't that simple.</b>

17:12.580 --> 17:14.340
<b>How to verbally express our motives...</b>

17:15.510 --> 17:17.270
<b>I'm not fond of it.</b>

17:18.810 --> 17:20.250
<b>But oddly enough...</b>

17:20.250 --> 17:22.580
<b>Or perhaps it's not that odd.</b>

17:23.690 --> 17:26.370
<b>Is that the key to understanding myself?</b>

17:28.350 --> 17:29.980
<b><i>What's he talking about?</i></b>

17:30.620 --> 17:33.510
<b>Head to the hotel, and wait 
for Phinks and the others.</b>

17:34.050 --> 17:35.940
<b>If they try to escape, kill them.</b>

17:36.420 --> 17:37.510
<b>Understood.</b>

17:39.990 --> 17:42.240
<b>Now that they're on the alert,</b>

17:42.240 --> 17:46.520
<b>we have to keep our distance, 
or they'll notice us.</b>

17:47.220 --> 17:49.740
<b>Make sure you're concealing your presence.</b>

17:49.740 --> 17:50.770
<b>Damn!</b>

17:50.770 --> 17:52.460
<b>You must be patient.</b>

17:52.460 --> 17:53.630
<b>I understand!</b>

17:53.630 --> 17:55.010
<b>You don't understand!</b>

17:55.760 --> 17:59.390
<b>Your reckless pursuit exposed 
them to needless danger.</b>

17:59.710 --> 18:03.020
<b>Do you know why they let 
themselves be captured?</b>

18:03.020 --> 18:05.120
<b>If you're caught here,</b>

18:05.120 --> 18:07.420
<b>no one will be able to stop the Troupe!</b>

18:14.240 --> 18:15.530
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

18:15.880 --> 18:19.380
<b>Humans have to lower their 
guard at some point.</b>

18:19.380 --> 18:20.780
<b>It's an endurance test.</b>

18:20.780 --> 18:21.850
<b>We must wait.</b>

18:22.410 --> 18:23.360
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:24.210 --> 18:25.380
<b>Where's Squala?</b>

18:26.800 --> 18:28.440
<b>He isn't answering his phone.</b>

18:32.050 --> 18:33.930
<b>It isn't the chain user.</b>

18:33.930 --> 18:35.010
<b>No.</b>

18:35.010 --> 18:36.810
<b>He was on the list.</b>

18:37.660 --> 18:38.590
<b>Get out.</b>

18:39.900 --> 18:43.560
<b><i>I'm pretty good at my job.</i></b>

18:44.740 --> 18:46.810
<b><i>I've survived some tight spots.</i></b>

18:50.040 --> 18:52.820
<b><i>There's a sort of gut instinct that 
works only in those times.</i></b>

18:54.190 --> 18:56.150
<b><i>And mine tells me that this...</i></b>

18:58.220 --> 19:00.750
<b><i>...is where I'll...</i></b>

19:01.370 --> 19:03.450
<b>If you move an inch, I'll cut you down.</b>

19:05.010 --> 19:08.090
<b>I have a few questions, 
so answer them honestly.</b>

19:08.950 --> 19:12.100
<b>One of your fellow bodyguards 
uses chains, right?</b>

19:12.100 --> 19:13.090
<b>Where is he now?</b>

19:13.640 --> 19:15.080
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

19:15.080 --> 19:16.590
<b>Who are you people?!</b>

19:16.980 --> 19:19.630
<b>Do you realize that I'm with 
the Nostrade Family...</b>

19:20.270 --> 19:22.050
<b>Answer the question.</b>

19:22.050 --> 19:23.930
<b>I'll break your left arm next.</b>

19:26.240 --> 19:27.060
<b>Hey!</b>

19:27.640 --> 19:29.820
<b>I told you not to move.</b>

19:29.820 --> 19:32.810
<b>Stand perfectly still, and answer her questions.</b>

19:33.220 --> 19:34.820
<b>What happened to Uvogin?</b>

19:35.640 --> 19:38.190
<b>I'm talking about the huge man you captured.</b>

19:38.190 --> 19:39.390
<b>What?</b>

19:39.390 --> 19:41.060
<b>He escaped!</b>

19:41.060 --> 19:42.700
<b>I don't know what happened after that!</b>

19:42.700 --> 19:44.580
<b>Where are your fellow bodyguards?</b>

19:44.580 --> 19:47.270
<b>They already went back to the island.</b>

19:47.270 --> 19:49.110
<b>I was on my way back!</b>

19:49.730 --> 19:51.510
<b>You shouldn't lie...</b>

19:51.510 --> 19:52.760
<b>It's the truth.</b>

19:52.760 --> 19:55.460
<b>Why would I lie in this situation?</b>

19:55.460 --> 19:57.480
<b>Let me ask you one more time.</b>

19:57.480 --> 19:59.280
<b>Where is the chain user?</b>

19:59.280 --> 20:01.730
<b>I don't know who you're talking about.</b>

20:01.730 --> 20:03.340
<b>None of the bodyguards uses chains!</b>

20:03.340 --> 20:04.770
<b>One last question.</b>

20:05.830 --> 20:07.850
<b>Is there someone for whom</b>

20:08.200 --> 20:09.290
<b>you care deeply?</b>

20:11.050 --> 20:14.310
<b>I wouldn't have chosen 
this job if there were!</b>

20:18.350 --> 20:19.880
<b>So her name's Eliza...</b>

20:21.100 --> 20:24.130
<b>She's pretty.</b>

20:24.870 --> 20:25.870
<b>If...</b>

20:26.620 --> 20:28.410
<b>If you lay one finger on Eliza—</b>

20:44.910 --> 20:46.960
<b>I warned you not to move...</b>

20:47.900 --> 20:49.390
<b>Twice.</b>

20:50.880 --> 20:53.450
<b>Did you get any data on the chain user?</b>

20:53.450 --> 20:54.480
<b>Naturally.</b>

20:54.980 --> 20:59.360
<b>It's too much trouble to explain, 
so I'll shoot the information into you.</b>

21:01.740 --> 21:03.420
<b>With my Memory Bomb.</b>

21:02.360 --> 21:04.360
<b>Recollection Bullet</b>

21:04.360 --> 21:06.120
<b>Recollection Bullet 
Memory Bomb</b>

21:06.440 --> 21:07.970
<b>If you're concerned, I'll stop.</b>

21:08.470 --> 21:10.620
<b>Are you stupid? Hurry up.</b>

21:23.780 --> 21:25.480
<b>I see...</b>

21:25.480 --> 21:29.260
<b>So that's what you look like, Kurapika-san.</b>

21:30.310 --> 21:34.900
<b>I won't forget your name 
and face until I kill you!</b>

21:38.100 --> 21:42.190
<b>The Phantom Troupe has finally 
identified Uvogin's killer.</b>

21:42.190 --> 21:45.870
<b>Kurapika races to rescue Gon and Killua.</b>

<b>The final battle draws near.</b>

<b>Brush Your Teeth.

<b>A Phantom Troupe member.</b>

23:11.250 --> 23:12.630
<b>An Enhancer.</b>

<b>An iaido master, who can use <i>En</i></b>

<b>An Enhancer.</b>

23:14.200 --> 23:16.160
<b>He likes Gon and Killua,</b>

23:14.290 --> 23:15.320
<b>in a four-meter radius.</b>

23:15.320 --> 23:17.000
<b>He focuses aura in his sword, to strike down foes</b>

<b>and wants to recruit 
them into the Troupe.</b>

23:17.000 --> 23:17.840

<b>Do you know?</b>

<b>Look it up in a dictionary.</b>
