00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
-Ah!
- She looks excited!

00:08.049 --> 00:11.052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.347
It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.349
-Oh!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.567
Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

00:28.111 --> 00:32.741
My mission is to spark joy
in the world through cleaning.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
<i>Ching!</i>

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
<i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:41.583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:43.334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
A feature of the KonMari Method

00:45.378 --> 00:48.214
is that you clean by item
and not by location.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
First, is clothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
I can't reach.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.849
Next, is books.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
Then, paper.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.439
I can't do the papers.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:12.614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

01:12.697 --> 01:13.740
and garage.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Everything miscellaneous.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.163
Finally, sentimental items.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
because I really like this one.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.212
This is kinda hard.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.093
But I wanna be thoughtful about it.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.554
<i>From the moment she set foot</i>
<i>in our house,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
She wants to see this place turned around.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
This is amazing.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440
You're so cute! I love you!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.734
You're so cute I love you, too.
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.872
<i>One, two, three. Jail!</i>

02:03.289 --> 02:04.999
- Goodbye.

02:05.083 --> 02:08.002
-One two, three, four, five six...
-Did you just say my name in vain?

02:08.086 --> 02:09.963
...eight, nine, ten, eleven.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.047
No!

02:11.131 --> 02:12.590
No!

02:12.674 --> 02:15.176
-I'll cost you 3... 440.
-Four-forty.

02:15.260 --> 02:19.139
We are the Mersiers.
Our nickname is The Fantastic Four.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.056
Indeed.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.726
And our son created that nickname
because all of us are outgoing,

02:23.810 --> 02:26.020
- Mm-hmm.
-all of us are extremely silly...

02:27.021 --> 02:30.567
...and we're artsy as a family.
We-- We just go for it.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.570
Whatever we're feeling, we just kinda do.

02:33.778 --> 02:37.198
What do you guys think about making sure
that we can hit the park...

02:37.282 --> 02:38.908
-Yes.
-...before it gets too dark?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.577
Does everybody have clothes for the park?

02:40.660 --> 02:43.204
-Do you know where they are?
-No. You know where they all are.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.748
You know what I did?
I went into my dressers,

02:45.832 --> 02:48.334
I took everything out to put it back in.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.628
To find one pair of pants.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.089
-I cannot find matching socks.
- Okay.

02:53.173 --> 02:57.051
Well, freeze the game, 'cause I don't want
anybody getting extra money.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.970
Do not mess up my board

02:59.053 --> 03:01.097
'cause you know I'm about
to come back and win after--

03:01.181 --> 03:04.642
No, I'm the one who's about to win!

03:04.726 --> 03:07.270
Moving from Michigan, we had to downsize

03:07.353 --> 03:10.148
coming from a four-story,
four-bedroom house,

03:10.398 --> 03:13.610
now reduced down
to a two-bedroom apartment.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.403
Do you know where your pants are?

03:15.820 --> 03:18.281
-Yeah, I just got some out.
- But I need shorts.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.451
-You only have one pair of shorts?
-I have, like, three!

03:22.035 --> 03:25.455
<i>In L.A. I'm starting</i>
<i>a new adventure with my entire family.</i>

03:25.747 --> 03:28.541
<i>We wanna take advantage</i>
<i>of the opportunities here.</i>

03:29.167 --> 03:31.502
<i>Back in Michigan, it could be</i>
<i>sometimes one note.</i>

03:31.586 --> 03:33.755
-If you're a hair stylist...
-Mm-hmm.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.673
...that work is limited in Michigan.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.176
If you are someone in music,

03:39.093 --> 03:41.387
-the jobs are limited.
-Indeed.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.806
-Did you find your black shorts?
-Um...

03:43.932 --> 03:46.059
We're gonna miss the sunlight
if we can't find 'em.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.477
-Real talk.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.480
Mom, do you know
where my matching jacket is?

03:50.980 --> 03:53.733
We've been living here
for a year and a half now.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.527
And I must say...

03:57.862 --> 03:59.155
it hasn't felt like home.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.075
<i>I mean, we're doing</i>
<i>the best we can because,</i>

04:02.408 --> 04:05.078
<i>you know, it's a smaller space</i>
<i>than what we're used to.</i>

04:05.411 --> 04:08.289
<i>But we feel stressed at home</i>
<i>because of the clutter.</i>

04:08.957 --> 04:11.209
<i>It's an unnecessary pressure</i>
<i>and stress for them</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:13.962
<i>to live tight like this.</i>

04:14.337 --> 04:17.423
<i>It's just this one big cycle of...</i>

04:18.258 --> 04:20.260
<i>jumbled scatterbrain.</i>

04:20.593 --> 04:22.178
<i>That's a big red flag.</i>

04:22.262 --> 04:24.097
<i>I don't want to live like that.</i>

04:24.305 --> 04:26.307
So, I need help.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.142
We need help.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.648
When my family and I moved
from Japan to the United States,

04:33.731 --> 04:40.154
we only brought things
that truly sparked joy for us.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.032
For the Mersier family,

04:43.116 --> 04:47.662
their new challenge is to downsize
the things that they own,

04:47.745 --> 04:49.747
so it will fit in their new home.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.343
It's so cute!

05:02.677 --> 05:03.970
Oh, wow!

05:04.554 --> 05:08.391
The look of American apartments
is so cute.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.810
Maybe it's the color.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.566
Hello.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.027
-Hi! Hello!
-Hi, come on in!

05:19.110 --> 05:21.154
-Hi!
- Nice to meet you!

05:21.237 --> 05:23.114
-Nice to meet you.
-I am Marie.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.367
-Nice to meet you. Douglas.
-Iida. Nice to meet you.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.870
-Katrina. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.872
-Goodness, it's so good to see you.
-Welcome.

05:30.955 --> 05:31.831
Thank you!

05:33.291 --> 05:35.585
I see a lot
of musical instruments already.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.253
-Do you play--
- I'm a musician.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.922
- Oh.
- I play upright, the guitar.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.674
- I play my voice.
-Oh, really?

05:41.758 --> 05:43.301
She's a sing-- She's our singer.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.510
-Wow. Great.
-Yeah.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.973
So your whole family is in one band or...?

05:50.099 --> 05:51.601
We look like it, huh?

05:51.684 --> 05:54.979
No, I'm not in a band.
I'm the hairstylist and I dress them all.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.105
- Wardrobe.
-Wow.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.941
-She makes sure we eat, you know?
-Yeah.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.656
-Let's start in…
-Yeah. We can go around. All this is...

06:05.740 --> 06:07.158
-...the living room.
-Yeah.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.410
-This is our multipurpose room.
-Yeah yeah yeah.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.370
Mm-hmm.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.122
-This is where we eat...
-Yeah yeah yeah.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.042
...we also watch movies,
and we have a huge DVD collection.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.461
Oh. Is this for your music?

06:18.544 --> 06:19.379
Yeah.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.801
-So cool!
-Yeah. It's cool.

06:24.884 --> 06:25.760
So cool.

06:26.761 --> 06:30.556
-This is our tight, tight kitchen.
-Yeah.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.350
It's my favorite room
not to be in.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.559
Ay-ay-ay.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.520
-This is what frustrates me, is...
- Yes.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.440
...I will come to get a glass, and it's
like all of the seasoning are in there.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.276
And it just looks cluttered to me,
and it just... I stay out.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.113
- And Dad doesn't cook at all.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.782
Did you use to cook?

06:48.241 --> 06:52.578
No. I had one accident
trying to make oatmeal, and I was like...

06:53.329 --> 06:56.624
- Not since then.
-I order a mean carry out though.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.794
Go into the bedroom.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.588
The bedroom. So he takes this dresser

07:02.672 --> 07:05.675
and I just try to put my life
in these six.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.261
-Your underwear...
-Underwear, socks...

07:08.594 --> 07:10.138
-and swimsuit stuff.
-Yeah yeah yeah.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.974
Are you aware
of where everything is?

07:13.057 --> 07:14.851
- Yes.
-She's the only one

07:14.934 --> 07:17.103
-that's aware of everything.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.480
We-- We ask her,

07:19.564 --> 07:21.149
"Look for a special shirt,"

07:21.232 --> 07:23.109
I'll say "Where is it?"
and she'll tell us.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.026
Ah.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.906
I'm sure it's a lot
when you get asked all the time, right?

07:28.990 --> 07:30.199
Oh, my.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.286
And they don't like my mood
because sometimes I'm like...

07:34.495 --> 07:36.581
<i>Katrina bears</i>
<i>a lot of the weight</i>

07:36.664 --> 07:39.250
<i>of keeping the house organized,</i>

07:39.333 --> 07:42.753
<i>and helping us to keep it organized,</i>
<i>because we don't know where things are.</i>

07:42.837 --> 07:45.840
It's the real daily struggle.
I'll be home alone,

07:46.299 --> 07:50.428
and I'll just say,
"Dang, where is this? I need this now."

07:50.803 --> 07:54.515
And I say,
"Mm, texting Mom. Gotta text Mom."

07:54.932 --> 07:56.392
And it will be to a certain point

07:56.476 --> 07:58.978
where I just spam her phone
until she answers.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.897
That's how much I depend on her.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.940
Have you ever seen such a thing?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.066
Every day.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.111
-I love a mess.
-Do you?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.362
-Yes.
-Yeah.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.739
-Oh!
-You know what?

08:10.072 --> 08:11.949
-This is so exciting for me.
- Is it?

08:12.033 --> 08:13.784
-Oh, I'm so glad. I'm so glad.
-Yeah.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.955
I'll let the kids show you their room.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.624
- Oh...
-So!

08:19.999 --> 08:21.709
Okay, let's open these up

08:21.792 --> 08:24.504
to show you how embarrassing
our clothes are up there.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.589
- Terrible.
-Oh, not tall enough.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.633
-I got it.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.593
Oh! Hey!

08:30.676 --> 08:32.011
I'm here for that.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.262
He's good!

08:33.554 --> 08:35.973
It's Kayci's and it's Nolan's?

08:36.057 --> 08:37.225
- Yeah.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.185
The funny thing with this shelf,

08:39.268 --> 08:41.604
so I bought it and I said,
"You take two shelves,

08:41.896 --> 08:43.314
he takes two shelves,

08:43.397 --> 08:45.691
and this can be
what you guys use during the day.

08:45.775 --> 08:49.028
Keep it neat."
But they can't find anything.

08:49.111 --> 08:52.615
So they'll pull everything down,
it'll be all over...

08:53.991 --> 08:55.535
-Wow.
- Yeah.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.162
I think it would be best

08:58.246 --> 09:00.706
if they have a dresser of their own,
too, eventually.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.874
Yes.

09:02.083 --> 09:05.211
The other half of the room,
it is also cluttered.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.712
There's no space.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.258
It's hard for me to feel
like this an actual home.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.849
So they have so much in the room,

09:19.600 --> 09:21.352
because when I organize it,

09:21.435 --> 09:24.647
they don't keep it organized.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.817
It's okay Mom. It's 'cause--
- 'Cause I keep trying.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.360
You're trying hard, I know.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.737
Yeah, like, she organizes our things,

09:31.821 --> 09:33.823
but we don't know how
to keep them organized,

09:33.906 --> 09:37.910
so then when we mess it up
it just hurts her, and it hurts me too,

09:37.994 --> 09:40.871
'cause I feel bad
after I mess it up, so...

09:40.955 --> 09:42.415
<i>I feel like I'm to blame</i>

09:42.873 --> 09:45.626
<i>'cause I'm the mom and Mom is supposed</i>
<i>to create the memories.</i>

09:45.710 --> 09:47.753
<i>Mom is supposed to make home home.</i>

09:47.837 --> 09:51.007
<i>I hold that near and dear and I own it.</i>

09:51.090 --> 09:53.467
<i>It's my responsibility to do the laundry,</i>

09:53.551 --> 09:56.512
<i>go to the grocery store,</i>
<i>wash dishes, cook,</i>

09:56.596 --> 09:58.556
<i>and I've got to clean the kids' room.</i>

09:58.639 --> 10:00.850
But I feel like I'm failing in that area.
Which is not okay with me.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.938
I want to...

10:06.022 --> 10:08.232
create a home
that they will remember, you know?

10:08.316 --> 10:11.611
I want them to remember
where they had peace of mind

10:11.694 --> 10:13.362
and they had a lot of love

10:13.738 --> 10:16.907
-and that's where their support came from.
-Mm-hmm.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.909
-As they were growing up.
-Indeed.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.202
-Sorry.
-We have to help, Mom.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.912
Let's keep showing her the other rooms.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.748
-Yeah. It's okay.
-Mama!

10:23.831 --> 10:25.916
-I'm okay.
-Mama, Mama, Mama.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.376
-I'm okay.
-Mama, Mama!

10:27.460 --> 10:28.794
It'll be okay.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.966
It seems like Katrina
manages all the family's belongings.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.427
However,

10:36.510 --> 10:38.512
through the KonMari Method of tidying,

10:38.596 --> 10:41.724
I would like to teach the family

10:41.807 --> 10:44.727
how to be responsible
with their belongings.

10:47.396 --> 10:50.149
So, we're gonna begin
the tidying process from here,

10:50.232 --> 10:52.652
but there's something that I like to do
before we begin.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.279
I always like to introduce myself
to the house.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.280
Wow.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.704
- Okay, great.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.458
- This is a very nice home.
- Thank you.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.379
- So, the first step is clothes.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.214
-Okay.
-Alright. Let's do that.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.516
First, let's begin
with making a big pile

12:05.599 --> 12:07.601
of all the clothes that you own.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.520
- Snuggy!

12:09.603 --> 12:10.604
Oh, my--

12:10.855 --> 12:12.022
-Ugh.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.066
- You got a lot of clothes.
-Actually...

12:14.150 --> 12:15.651
Yeah, he has way more than me.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.238
No. You always are like,
"I don't have anything to wear."

12:19.321 --> 12:20.948
That's 'cause they're always dirty.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.117
- All his stuff is out.
- We did it!

12:23.200 --> 12:24.201
Woof!

12:28.914 --> 12:31.083
How do you feel looking at your piles?

12:37.798 --> 12:40.426
Seeing that much for her,

12:40.760 --> 12:44.513
I'm definitely not setting her up
to win at life.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.349
He's 12, she's 11.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.478
We could have started this at age five,
just like you.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.147
- Not too late, never too late.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.523
-Mm-hmm.
-That's it.

12:56.442 --> 13:00.070
So from here, we'll be selecting
the clothes that you want to keep

13:00.154 --> 13:01.489
and what you want to let go.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.909
Only keep clothes that sparks joy for you.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.036
-Yes.
-Clothes that you've decided to let go,

13:07.244 --> 13:09.705
thank it for all
that it's been doing for you.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.873
-Gratitude.
-Yeah.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.958
-Gratitude is very important.
- Yeah.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.085
Done so much good for me.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.504
I thank you for that.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.549
You know,
your girl isn't gonna get rid of you.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.384
How have I not worn you before?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.887
You give me so much joy. Oh, my goodness!

13:26.680 --> 13:28.516
For kids, you guys don't have drawers,

13:28.599 --> 13:30.643
so I have something to recommend to you.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.228
- Alright.
- Okay.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.069
We're gonna create storage
out of these shoe boxes,

13:40.152 --> 13:41.487
but it's only temporary for now.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.368
In an empty box,
stack them vertically like this.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.161
- Oh.
- There we go.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.163
- Wow.
- That's unbelievable.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.917
So, you had put clothing racks
in your room, right?

13:55.000 --> 13:55.835
Yes.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.838
- You can put the box in there.
- Oh, that's amazing.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.924
So then you can go ahead
and buy a dresser or...

14:02.007 --> 14:04.385
you know, you'll know exactly
how much space you need.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.555
With Marie coming to help us,
this is the opportunity

14:07.638 --> 14:09.849
for me to learn how to organize

14:09.932 --> 14:12.643
and to downsize, so that I can finally

14:12.726 --> 14:15.312
make this place a home.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.564
-Bye.
- I'll get that.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.232
-Bye.
-We'll miss you. 'Til the next time.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.192
- Yeah.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.778
Oh, my gosh.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.738
That was amazing!

14:24.822 --> 14:26.991
-Can she come back, please?
- She blew my mind.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.576
-I know, right?
- My goodness.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.077
Let's get busy with the homework.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.370
Right. We have to--

14:31.453 --> 14:34.290
If you don't get your homework done,
you won't be able to sleep.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.500
-Think about it.
-You'd better finish.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.300
<i>Are these my goggles?</i>

14:47.303 --> 14:49.096
Get out. Swim.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.016
It sounds like you guys are playing.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.685
Come on now, do the right thing in there.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.105
Oh, gosh, why did I do this
to these shoes, too?

14:58.188 --> 14:59.315
What'd you do?

14:59.773 --> 15:01.984
-This.
- Bro!

15:02.067 --> 15:05.237
Oh, no. But those are such good shoes.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.572
The first Jordans.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.574
No!

15:08.657 --> 15:10.200
How's it coming? Are you done?

15:10.284 --> 15:11.744
- Almost.
-This is my problem.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.621
- You can't--
- Finish.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.956
You owe it to yourselves to finish.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.667
Y'all don't wanna do this tonight, do you?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.585
Nope.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.588
<i>I get frustrated from the clutter.</i>

15:22.671 --> 15:24.715
I would like for home
to feel like home for them

15:24.798 --> 15:27.343
and I feel like it starts with me. I do.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.262
<i>So I've ended up with doing</i>
<i>their homework for them.</i>

15:30.638 --> 15:32.348
<i>Being a mom is demanding.</i>

15:32.473 --> 15:35.100
<i>I feel accountable for...</i>

15:35.184 --> 15:38.145
<i>downsizing, how things are organized,</i>

15:38.228 --> 15:41.440
<i>so everyone's like,</i>
<i>"Mom, where did you put my this?</i>

15:41.523 --> 15:43.150
<i>Mom, where did you put my that?"</i>

15:43.233 --> 15:45.736
And they know,
I like being able to say "It's here"

15:45.819 --> 15:48.697
because I know
that in their mind it's jumbled,

15:48.781 --> 15:50.991
and I know that the one thing I want
is peace of mind.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.159
I want to give that to them.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.579
<i>But it bothers me slightly</i>
<i>that they come to me...</i>

15:56.121 --> 15:58.123
<i>wondering where is everything.</i>

15:58.374 --> 15:59.541
<i>It's overwhelming.</i>

16:00.709 --> 16:03.170
<i>So I want-- I want them to get that.</i>

16:13.847 --> 16:15.849
We look like we're best friends.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.811
-Marie, hi!
-Hi!

16:24.733 --> 16:25.734
Iida, hi!

16:26.193 --> 16:28.404
-Nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.905
Welcome, welcome.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.366
I couldn't wait to see you today.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.915
-It's raining so hard today.
-I know. I wish I could control it.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.045
Today's theme is miscellaneous items.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.801
-I'll pull it.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.636
This category
of miscellaneous items,

16:52.720 --> 16:56.640
there's a lot of different sub-categories
within this big category.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.226
The trick is to start with something
that's easy for you.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.646
You know, I can actually put this here,
so we can see what we have.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.316
- So bed linens for Kayci?
- Yes.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.403
But I wasn't quite sure
if I was folding them properly.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.616
As long as you're folding it
upright like this, you've got it.

17:19.621 --> 17:23.625
Folding fitted sheets...

17:24.543 --> 17:28.172
seem to trouble many people.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.841
Fitted sheets contain...

17:31.133 --> 17:37.389
rubber bands inside, so you cannot fold...

17:38.182 --> 17:41.518
the edges together.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.980
But don't worry,

17:45.064 --> 17:46.815
take the sides towards...

17:48.484 --> 17:50.277
the center,

17:50.736 --> 17:54.782
creating a rectangle.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.744
Whichever way you choose

17:58.827 --> 18:01.330
to fold the sheets,

18:02.247 --> 18:04.124
when storing in drawers,

18:04.333 --> 18:06.293
if you store them standing upright,

18:06.502 --> 18:09.421
they will look neat.

18:11.381 --> 18:15.052
So, I kinda wanna set
the family up to win,

18:15.135 --> 18:18.722
so I need your advice on that,
'cause you leave your family, right?

18:18.806 --> 18:22.810
Do they maintain the way you have the home
organized and everything?

18:24.561 --> 18:28.565
Yes, as a family, each person has
a room that they're responsible for.

18:28.649 --> 18:32.319
-But laundry, that's my forte--
-Right.

18:32.402 --> 18:35.781
-I'm sure that's accumulating as we speak.
-Yes. Oh, my goodness, yes.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.118
So I was wondering,
when I first met you,

18:39.201 --> 18:43.580
I noticed that a lot of the cleaning
and tidying fell to you.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.125
Do you think through this process
that'll change?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.710
I think they'll be more proactive

18:48.794 --> 18:53.757
because they now have some clue
of where their things are.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.759
And instead of me doing it,

18:55.843 --> 18:58.345
I think,
now I'll be able to just guide 'em,

18:58.428 --> 18:59.972
and not just me doing it.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.892
You know, you're living together,

19:03.976 --> 19:07.020
so it's important for everyone
to maintain their space

19:07.104 --> 19:10.399
and their belongings, but not only that,
but to help each other as well.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.401
<i>Before Marie came,</i>

19:12.484 --> 19:15.320
<i>I wasn't setting</i>
<i>my own self up to win as a mom.</i>

19:15.404 --> 19:17.030
<i>I was doing too much.</i>

19:17.114 --> 19:20.159
Instead of being a homemaker,
I'm a make-it-work-maker.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.495
Do what you gotta do to make it work,
be strong, be tough.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.915
And that love is just
dwindling down because

19:26.999 --> 19:29.001
no one person can do it all.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.794
<i>So, Marie's right.</i>

19:30.878 --> 19:33.964
<i>We all need to work together, as a family.</i>

19:34.298 --> 19:36.967
-I like the idea of assigning everyone.
- Yeah.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.720
It gives them a job
that they're responsible for.

19:39.803 --> 19:43.098
But I'm nervous about
the organization of it,

19:43.182 --> 19:47.019
because they sort it
and I helped with the organizing, so...

19:48.228 --> 19:49.980
It's perfectly understandable

19:50.063 --> 19:52.107
for you to help and create
their storage spaces,

19:52.191 --> 19:53.400
but I think it's important

19:53.483 --> 19:56.361
is that every time you remind them
where everything is,

19:56.445 --> 19:58.197
so that they start to learn.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.324
To make-- Yes. I agree.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.743
I'm going to adopt that, and...

20:02.826 --> 20:04.703
I'm sure I won't have a problem.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.623
They like teamwork, so, definitely.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.042
Thanks for sharing.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.670
- Thank you.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.755
Thank you.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.679
- I want to load this bucket.
-Yes?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.097
-With everything we can.
-Mm-hmm.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.600
Take it out there,
so we can do it as a family.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.517
Got it.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.146
-I may get serious.
- Nolan! Kayci!

20:31.230 --> 20:32.064
Calm down.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.399
Everybody come
get one thing and we're done.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.778
I got us in this hole,
let me get us out of it.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.404
I feel like this is my chance

20:39.863 --> 20:43.283
to redeem myself and to help the family.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.701
So I'm excited.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.620
- Yay.
- Bathroom's clear.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.373
How are you guys feeling?
Did you know all this was in there?

20:49.456 --> 20:50.290
Yeah.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.292
I know you guys don't know...

20:53.043 --> 20:54.628
where to find half this stuff.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.797
This is the stuff you guys call me about.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.007
- Yeah.
-So now that we can do this,

20:59.091 --> 21:01.218
I'll know exactly where it is,

21:01.426 --> 21:04.054
and more importantly,
you'll know exactly where it is.

21:04.137 --> 21:04.972
Okay.

21:05.889 --> 21:09.434
<i> </i>I want to learn
where I should put things,

21:09.518 --> 21:11.645
but at the same time I kind of,
like my mom,

21:12.187 --> 21:14.398
having to know where everything is,

21:14.481 --> 21:16.525
because I don't have
to think about it as much.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.362
That's the procrastinator
coming out in me.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.740
Listen, you're gonna have
to take care of these things...

21:24.199 --> 21:25.617
and find a home for them.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.203
-Do you even have all the pieces?
- Yes.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.248
-You have a knitting loom in here.
-Yes. Oh, wait, I knew that.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.166
Let me talk about our new lifestyle.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.794
If you opened this and saw this in here,

21:35.877 --> 21:38.755
why not take this out
and go put it in its home?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.507
Well, I didn't know to do that.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.092
- So now--
-Now I do know.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.052
-Let me ask you, does this have a home?
-Yes.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.471
-Where?
-In my drawer.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.265
At the end of this process,
I want my children,

21:51.059 --> 21:53.562
my husband, and myself,
I want our family...

21:53.979 --> 21:55.772
to know how to organize,

21:56.356 --> 22:00.110
for the sake of having a home
and not just a house.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.325
- <i>Douglas.</i>
- <i>I'm chilling.</i>

22:06.408 --> 22:08.160
-You can do whatever you want.
-Mm-hmm.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.164
But, just know
we've got some homework to do.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.374
- Hey.
- <i>Hey!</i>

22:14.708 --> 22:17.252
So, when I came in, I was like,
"What's going on here?"

22:17.336 --> 22:19.463
All this stuff is crazy.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.256
<i> That's trash.</i>

22:21.340 --> 22:24.259
This is all trash.
The box underneath is trash.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.220
<i>You can take out all of that trash,</i>
<i>and the only reason I didn't,</i>

22:27.304 --> 22:30.015
<i>I love you so much,</i>
<i>is because it was raining.</i>

22:30.098 --> 22:32.517
Alright. Okay, thank you.
I'll talk to you later.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.645
Duties in the house. We all do cleaning.

22:36.396 --> 22:39.316
We all try to manage, um...

22:40.776 --> 22:42.569
-Ahem!
-What?

22:43.445 --> 22:44.696
Dad doesn't clean?

22:45.530 --> 22:48.825
Dad doesn't do the bathroom.
Dad doesn't do the kitchen.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.118
Not as much as you.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.204
-Okay, hold on.
-That was-- Yeah, we do it way more.

22:52.287 --> 22:55.582
I'll say this, you guys do do those areas
more than me.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.251
But I do cleaning
when you guys are asleep,

22:58.335 --> 23:01.213
picking up your backpacks,
picking up your socks,

23:01.296 --> 23:03.298
picking up your shoes, sweeping.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.675
I like to think of that
as straightening up.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.719
-Yeah. I hear you.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.096
Ah!

23:11.223 --> 23:13.683
-You flinched!
-You guys working nicely in there?

23:13.975 --> 23:15.060
Yeah.

23:15.769 --> 23:16.978
Let's get to work.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.440
-I have get the mail, take out the trash.
-Write it down.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.526
-Recycling.
-You get the mail?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.653
-Yes, I do get the mail.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.279
I'm laughing at you two.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.031
These-- These just...

23:28.115 --> 23:30.158
-Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie!

23:30.242 --> 23:32.244
-It's a lie.
- Oh, my--

23:32.702 --> 23:35.372
-I'm so excited about you helping.
- Yeah.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.124
You can put these back.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.168
No. I was, uh, putting 'em out for drying.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.546
I'm not gonna dry the clean dishes
with those towels

23:42.629 --> 23:44.423
-'cause those are not clean.
-Got it.

23:44.840 --> 23:49.010
<i>I feel guilty about Katrina</i>
<i>having the majority of the housework.</i>

23:49.094 --> 23:51.638
That's one of the reasons
why I've been trying to be more active,

23:51.972 --> 23:55.225
you know, with the cleaning
and the chores and the duties.

23:55.308 --> 23:58.311
I can organize certain things
that I feel confident in,

23:58.395 --> 24:02.315
but certain things
I just don't feel confident in just yet.

24:02.649 --> 24:05.193
I left you this space.
You can keep sitting 'em right there.
-I didn't wanna do that.
- You can sit that right there.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.406
What did you wanna do, Dad?

24:09.990 --> 24:11.366
Yeah, it doesn't even matter.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.410
How do you want me to grab 'em,
and dry 'em?

24:13.493 --> 24:15.328
No, no, no, that's fine.

24:15.662 --> 24:18.039
<i>I'm thankful to get help from my family.</i>

24:18.123 --> 24:20.625
Even though they're still, I think,
a long way to go,

24:20.709 --> 24:23.295
I feel like my family is off
to a good start.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.173
- Hi, hello.

24:26.256 --> 24:29.468
-It's Marie. Hi!
- Hi!

24:29.551 --> 24:30.760
Marie and Marie!

24:32.179 --> 24:34.264
-Hi!
- It's been too long.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.932
- Too long.
-We've missed you.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.769
We're gonna work together on the--
in the kitchen.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.354
-Together. I'm okay.
-Yes.

24:42.772 --> 24:47.360
Douglas, I'd love for you to work
on sentimental items, the last category.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.946
I know that all the steps
that you've gone through

24:50.030 --> 24:51.156
was very, very difficult.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.493
All throughout, you've sharpened
your decision-making skills,

24:54.576 --> 24:57.954
so you should be confident in your ability
to go through your sentimental items.

24:58.038 --> 25:02.542
Alright, I'll start pulling the things out
to start the process. Thank you.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.712
-Alright.
-Good luck.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.672
Right. Good luck, I need it.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.091
-Good luck to you.
-Wish me luck. Right.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.093
-I'm nervous.
-Good luck. She's scared.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.764
So, the items that are sentimental,

25:15.847 --> 25:20.185
we're going to try to categorize those
for each individual.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.521
So if you come across something
that you know that's Mom's,

25:22.604 --> 25:24.272
put it in Mom's sentimental pile.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.732
- Alright?
- Yeah.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.234
No.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.528
Thank you.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.531
Something smells good.

25:33.448 --> 25:34.741
American trash bags are amazing!

25:34.824 --> 25:37.953
It smells so good.
American garbage bags smell nice.

25:39.412 --> 25:42.123
This cabinet is ridiculous.
It's hard to reach.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.837
Going forward, let's try to keep
things that we don't use as frequently

25:47.921 --> 25:49.881
in hard-to-reach places like that.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.264
When using kitchen cabinets,

25:57.347 --> 26:00.684
in the area that is easily accessible,
store items that are used often

26:00.767 --> 26:04.854
such as plates, glasses, and mugs.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.148
On the top shelf,

26:07.232 --> 26:11.528
store items that are used less often,
such as seasonal plates,

26:11.611 --> 26:13.446
and plates for guests.

26:14.030 --> 26:17.659
Paper plates and straws are also items
that are used less often.

26:17.742 --> 26:21.162
These types of items
can become easily accessible

26:21.246 --> 26:22.706
if stored in a box.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.669
-Maybe a little bit more safe.
- Thank you.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.421
- This one?

26:29.504 --> 26:31.256
Yeah, Nolan just decided to keep it.

26:31.339 --> 26:34.759
It was a sippy cup his godmother
bought for him and it's engraved.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.386
-Yeah.
-And we asked him,

26:36.469 --> 26:39.014
"Will you drink out of it?"
He's like "Yes, yes." And we're like--

26:41.182 --> 26:43.310
We can put it with your trophies
or in the kitchen.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.812
He said, "Put it in the kitchen.
Put it in the kitchen."

26:46.354 --> 26:49.691
Okay, so let's make this
a decoration for the kitchen.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.444
-We'll decide a nice place for it later.
- Okay.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.446
<i>I love the way...</i>

26:54.529 --> 26:56.906
she doesn't make
any of the family members feel bad

26:56.990 --> 26:59.075
about what they wanna keep,
or what they don't.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.201
I mean, I'm learning.

27:02.037 --> 27:05.206
That's very important when
you're tidying, to respect each other.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.500
Having a family of my own
and being a mother,

27:07.584 --> 27:09.628
and I think that the things in our house

27:09.711 --> 27:12.881
and all the family members in a home
kind of function the same way.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.718
We each play a role and we only have
a limited amount of space

27:16.801 --> 27:19.220
-and we all need each other.
-That's true. It's so true.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.181
I understand. Thank you.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.098
Thank you.

27:22.682 --> 27:27.520
This process that Marie's
helping us with is uncovering layers,

27:27.604 --> 27:29.689
not just<i> </i>to material things,

27:29.773 --> 27:32.609
but, like, the layers between our dynamic
with our family.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.320
Mom, she's been the one that

27:35.403 --> 27:39.032
has been trying to keep us all together
and keep us organized,

27:39.115 --> 27:42.827
and, so, now that we have
this tidying method,

27:42.911 --> 27:46.039
I feel like we really need to keep it up.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.499
- Mm-hmm.
-You know?

27:47.582 --> 27:50.001
Not just for her,

27:50.085 --> 27:52.420
but for ourselves, you know?
Before, I had the wrong mentality

27:54.923 --> 27:58.426
to not want to engage and help,
and even...

27:59.052 --> 28:01.846
not see the value
of learning something like this.

28:01.930 --> 28:06.059
But, now, I realize the responsibility
should not be on Mom.

28:06.142 --> 28:08.561
It should be on the family,
the members of that house.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.856
I'm gonna be the laundry champion.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.775
You gonna be able to sort it, too?

28:14.109 --> 28:17.112
I'll assist you with sorting,
so I can learn.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.489
- Mm-hmm?
-Gonna be a laundry champion.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.241
Alright.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.701
Stay on top of it.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.370
<i>I didn't realize the pressure of</i>

28:25.453 --> 28:28.707
<i>having to do everything</i>
<i>until I actually did it.</i>

28:29.124 --> 28:31.584
So now I do want to help
with that a lot more.

28:31.918 --> 28:36.423
I am working on organizing more of

28:36.506 --> 28:38.049
my studio equipment...

28:38.925 --> 28:41.553
that was under the printer area.

28:41.761 --> 28:44.931
So all of your items
pretty much fit in your closet now.

28:45.014 --> 28:45.849
Yeah.

28:45.932 --> 28:47.976
Lot of hard work,
you're doing a great job.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.018
Thank you.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.813
<i>Nolan and Kayci,,</i>
<i>they're doing a terrific job.</i>

28:52.397 --> 28:55.942
<i>I'm literally looking at their</i>
<i>shelves and how they're organizing.</i>

28:57.652 --> 28:59.320
I can't believe

28:59.404 --> 29:01.698
<i>they did it without me.</i>

29:02.490 --> 29:04.200
You just feel so proud.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.787
Our life is finally coming together.
That's how-- That's how I feel.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.289
The kids are doing great.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.958
You're doing great,
I'm trying to keep the energy high.

29:12.041 --> 29:14.252
-We're gonna get through this.
- Awesome.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.671
I'm definitely getting
instant gratification.

29:17.088 --> 29:22.427
For one, I have the entire Fantastic Four
doing it with me.

29:22.510 --> 29:25.138
This is looking pretty good, guys.

29:25.221 --> 29:29.058
I came around to check on everybody
and I saw the most amazing thing.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.978
- What'd you see, Mom?
-Everybody had everything folded.

29:32.061 --> 29:34.564
-They had it lined up, standing.
-Especially me.

29:34.647 --> 29:37.609
Nice and neat on its own,
socks, underwear,

29:37.692 --> 29:40.153
-shorts, anything that was difficult.
-Especially me.

29:40.236 --> 29:42.197
-They had it all. Dad.
- I had it.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.617
He had it all in a file system.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.453
I could cry.
Like, my family is becoming a family.

29:48.536 --> 29:52.290
My family is growing,
my kids are doing their own thing.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.628
My kids know how to take care
of their resources.

29:57.504 --> 29:58.671
New day, new joy!<i> </i>Whoo-hoo!

29:59.047 --> 30:01.466
<i>Marie brought a whole bunch of joy</i>
<i>upon our home.</i>

30:01.925 --> 30:04.302
<i>I think my mom is way less...</i>

30:04.594 --> 30:06.179
stressed out.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.516
I can see it in her face,
I can see it in her movement.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.768
She lifted the weight
off my mom's shoulders.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.061
A lot of weight.

30:13.520 --> 30:17.482
Because now me and my sister can do things
by ourselves without asking her.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.442
Where you gonna put those to dry?

30:19.692 --> 30:22.278
Uh, I'll lay a towel out,
or I'll just dry 'em.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.905
You know where to get the towels from?

30:23.988 --> 30:25.698
I do know where to get the towels from.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.742
-You know where to put the towels back?

30:27.826 --> 30:30.495
-I know where to put the towels back.
-Okay, just checking.

30:30.578 --> 30:33.706
I trust you. I trust you. I trust you.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.000
This method has helped us to grow up.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.045
I know for sure me.
I'm saying us, but I'm saying me.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.505
I'm growing up here.

30:40.588 --> 30:41.673
-You're growing up.
-Yeah.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.143
I'm looking forward to this.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.396
Everyone in the family
has worked very hard.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.148
Hello!

30:59.399 --> 31:01.276
-Oh, hi!
-Hi!

31:01.359 --> 31:03.528
-Hi, Kayci.
-Hi, Marie.

31:03.611 --> 31:06.155
-So good to see you!
-Good to see you!

31:06.239 --> 31:08.241
This place looks so lovely.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.951
It's so lovely.

31:10.034 --> 31:13.162
-We are so tired.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.956
But so happy!

31:15.582 --> 31:17.750
- Much different.
-This is amazing.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.336
-It's beautiful.
-That's how we feel.

31:20.420 --> 31:21.880
-Really proud.
-It was because of you.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.675
- May I see the living room?
-Yes.

31:27.302 --> 31:32.891
<i>So, Marie, this room is now</i>
<i>much, much larger right?</i>

31:32.974 --> 31:35.184
<i>It really transformed!</i>

31:36.895 --> 31:41.357
<i>Oh, the feeling around this TV</i>
<i>is just so different from before.</i>

31:41.441 --> 31:43.818
- <i>It's nice and clean.</i>
- <i>Much different.</i>

31:44.986 --> 31:47.447
<i>Oh, and look at those</i>
<i>musical instruments.</i>

31:47.530 --> 31:49.574
- <i>Joy. All around.</i>
- <i>Beautiful there.</i>

31:49.657 --> 31:51.868
- <i>You wanna see the kitchen?</i>
- <i>Let's go.</i>

31:51.951 --> 31:53.536
Right this way. Yeah, you can come.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.872
- I'm gonna wash my hands.
- I need a tour.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.959
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

32:00.126 --> 32:02.754
- <i>This is incredible!</i>
<i>-</i> <i>That's how I feel.</i>

32:03.212 --> 32:06.633
<i>I started making my decisions confidently.</i>

32:07.592 --> 32:08.968
<i>Found my joy.</i>

32:09.052 --> 32:12.138
It felt so good in here,
I even came in here

32:12.221 --> 32:14.057
and made a salad for everybody.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.309
-I never come in here.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.813
<i>Mom's been doing a great job.</i>
<i>She's been working really hard.</i>

32:21.981 --> 32:24.025
- <i>Phenomenal job, Katrina.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Thank you.</i>

32:24.108 --> 32:26.611
-<i>It was well worth it.</i>
- <i>A lot more space. Feels great.</i>

32:26.694 --> 32:29.405
<i>My husband picked up</i>
<i>the dry cleaning</i>

32:29.489 --> 32:32.158
<i>and did the laundry and folded it.</i>

32:32.241 --> 32:34.369
- <i>Helpful!</i>
<i>-</i> <i>That was so helpful.</i>

32:34.869 --> 32:39.082
<i>Alright, Nolan, Kayci,</i>
<i>come show Miss Marie your room!</i>

32:40.959 --> 32:42.585
<i>Oh, how lovely!</i>

32:43.002 --> 32:44.796
<i>-</i> <i>Well done!</i>

32:44.879 --> 32:46.881
<i> I was really happy</i>
<i>about the dressers</i>

32:46.965 --> 32:49.968
<i>and them being able to utilize them.</i>

32:51.386 --> 32:54.263
- <i>You guys worked so hard, I am so--</i>
- <i>We did.</i>

32:54.347 --> 32:57.058
- <i>We wanted to make you proud.</i>
- <i>It's been a journey.</i>

32:57.517 --> 33:01.312
And I think about
to when you first arrived, and...

33:02.230 --> 33:05.024
<i>not only was the home all over the place,</i>

33:05.108 --> 33:07.151
<i>-our lives were all over the place.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

33:07.235 --> 33:10.238
See, the biggest thing for us was...

33:10.321 --> 33:15.493
that we didn't have the ability to know
how to declutter, how to tidy.

33:15.576 --> 33:18.871
But now, we have the ability
to continue to help the...

33:19.330 --> 33:22.834
the kids to learn it,
and they've learned it at this early age.

33:23.126 --> 33:25.712
And, so, that was very important to me.

33:25.795 --> 33:28.464
This house is finally a home.

33:28.548 --> 33:31.092
I feel joy and I feel peace being here.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.137
-Thank you so much.
- Amazing job, thank you.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.764
- Thank you.
-Thank you. Mm-hmm.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.599
- <i>I feel proud.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

33:38.683 --> 33:40.476
I thought that moving here

33:40.768 --> 33:43.271
and living in this space
was something I just had to take.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.981
-Something I had to go through.
-Deal with.

33:45.064 --> 33:45.940
Deal with.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.318
-Safe travels to you. Safe travels.
-Alright, take care.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.446
See you, thank you very much!

33:51.529 --> 33:52.447
Bye.

33:52.530 --> 33:56.117
You put your mind to it,
something you had no idea how to do,

33:56.200 --> 33:57.160
something that...

33:58.077 --> 34:01.039
-bossed you for so long like it had me.
-Indeed.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.957
And now,

34:03.041 --> 34:05.418
you can move anywhere and make it a home.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.211
You just learned a life skill.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.214
-You-- Your kids know a life skill.
-I can't wait to--

34:10.298 --> 34:12.967
-You're able to pass that on.
-Yeah. Indeed.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.220

<i>It feels so great.</i>
