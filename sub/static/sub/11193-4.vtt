00:07.500 --> 00:09.826
<i>Chevron four encoded.</i>

00:09.859 --> 00:13.019
This is video the MALP sent back
from P7J-989.

00:13.019 --> 00:16.419
Atmosphere, temperature,
and radioactivity levels are ideal.

00:16.419 --> 00:17.367
Teal'c,...

00:17.458 --> 00:19.083
...is this structure familiar?

00:19.138 --> 00:22.937
- It is not of Goa'uld origin.
- It looks pretty advanced.

00:22.937 --> 00:25.643
<i>It's a possible new source
of technology.</i>

00:27.176 --> 00:30.132
Maybe even an ally against the Goa'uld.

00:30.137 --> 00:32.972
- Looks worth a try, Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

00:45.055 --> 00:47.095
This is beautiful.

00:47.136 --> 00:48.759
Yeah.

00:48.816 --> 00:52.101
But where there's a garden,
there's snakes.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.774
And flowers.

00:58.573 --> 01:00.613
Way too many flowers!

01:24.569 --> 01:26.859
I like what they've done with the place.

01:26.890 --> 01:29.263
I'm not so sure I like
what it's done to them.

01:49.328 --> 01:51.367
They're human.

01:51.847 --> 01:53.923
They are breathing.

01:55.366 --> 02:00.278
All right, does anyone have any idea...

02:00.808 --> 02:03.560
...what these chambers might be?

02:04.046 --> 02:06.334
Some kind of medical device, maybe.

02:06.367 --> 02:08.525
Suspended animation of some kind.

02:23.163 --> 02:25.572
This is way past our science.

02:30.641 --> 02:32.185
God!

04:02.072 --> 04:03.733
What is this place?

04:03.792 --> 04:04.788
Uh...

04:05.230 --> 04:06.641
I dunno.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.169
Can't put my finger on it.

04:09.471 --> 04:11.510
It appears to be Earth.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.750
Yeah.

04:17.829 --> 04:19.158
Teal'c,...

04:19.228 --> 04:22.100
...what the hell just happened to us?

04:23.988 --> 04:26.396
We were exploring PJ7-989.

04:26.427 --> 04:30.473
We entered into a large domed facility
and endured some form of bodily attack.

04:47.146 --> 04:48.141
Kawalsky?

04:50.985 --> 04:51.981
John?!

04:52.064 --> 04:56.016
It's "Colonel".
You can lower your weapon, Captain.

04:58.345 --> 05:01.014
Why you acting so spooked, Jack?

05:02.745 --> 05:05.201
Maybe... because I am?

05:06.622 --> 05:08.331
You're both supposed to be dead.

05:09.423 --> 05:11.463
That's real cute, Jack.

05:12.341 --> 05:14.548
Look, the intel on this one is good.

05:14.583 --> 05:18.141
They keep Boris here during the day,
take him underground at night.

05:18.141 --> 05:21.821
Our bird confirmed on its last flyover,
no snipers, only two guards.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.021
It's a piece of cake.
This ain't the one that you and me die on.

05:25.021 --> 05:27.643
As a matter of fact,
this is the one you die on.

05:40.178 --> 05:42.966
<i>I went on this mission in 1982.</i>

05:42.978 --> 05:44.853
East Germany.

05:44.899 --> 05:48.257
We were supposed to grab
a Russian agent from that house.

05:48.259 --> 05:50.548
- It all went bad.
- You ready to move out...

05:50.579 --> 05:52.238
...or not, Captain?

05:52.817 --> 05:54.858
No. No.

05:56.615 --> 05:58.490
Cos this isn't real. It can't be.

05:58.538 --> 06:00.199
Oh, it's very real.

06:00.257 --> 06:02.927
Your stall is putting us in jeopardy.
Let's move out.

06:02.935 --> 06:04.975
No.

06:05.016 --> 06:08.468
Because I'm either dreaming
or hallucinating.

06:13.776 --> 06:16.314
Was that real enough for you, Jack?

06:21.694 --> 06:23.935
All right, how do you explain him?

06:23.973 --> 06:26.048
Does he look like one of us?

06:30.653 --> 06:31.649
Thomas...

06:31.733 --> 06:34.521
...has been on this team
longer than you have.

06:34.533 --> 06:37.154
Think straight.
We are not aborting the mission.

06:37.172 --> 06:38.797
D'you understand?

06:43.692 --> 06:45.731
What the hell is this?

06:53.050 --> 06:55.091
What the hell's going on?

06:59.290 --> 07:01.331
I am as perplexed as you.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.673
<i>Teal'c,...</i>

07:05.928 --> 07:07.968
...do you think...

07:08.687 --> 07:12.928
Is there a chance those machines
we were sucked into were some kind of,...

07:12.930 --> 07:15.682
...I don't know,
time machine or something?

07:15.687 --> 07:17.514
It is possible.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.726
The Goa'uld have experimented
with time manipulation.

07:20.726 --> 07:22.766
Perhaps another race succeeded.

07:22.807 --> 07:24.432
So, this is real?

07:24.485 --> 07:26.942
You say this is a mission
that did not go well?

07:26.966 --> 07:27.665
Yes.

07:27.766 --> 07:31.018
Perhaps you've been given
the opportunity to alter your history.

07:36.923 --> 07:37.920
OK.

07:39.324 --> 07:41.365
Let's move out.

07:41.404 --> 07:43.029
It's about time.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.480
<i>Hold up!</i>

08:07.961 --> 08:10.120
Let's not make the same mistake twice.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.529
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Sniper on the roof.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.409
Nice catch, Jack.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.500
Let's go.

09:41.311 --> 09:42.936
Group now!

09:50.269 --> 09:51.134
Aargh!

09:51.828 --> 09:53.157
Urgh!

10:07.346 --> 10:09.255
Come on, John!

10:10.826 --> 10:13.496
So much for satellite recon.

10:13.505 --> 10:15.249
Hey, Jack,...

10:15.307 --> 10:17.845
...take care of Barbara for me, man.

10:25.224 --> 10:27.051
Fall back!

10:37.663 --> 10:40.533
- Where's Kawalsky?
- He was immediately behind us.

10:49.422 --> 10:51.461
Lower your weapon, Captain.

11:01.899 --> 11:03.940
OK, what just happened?

11:04.740 --> 11:06.779
I'm not sure.

11:10.499 --> 11:12.825
This place looks familiar.

11:20.057 --> 11:22.096
Wait a minute.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.418
Wait a minute!

11:27.136 --> 11:30.008
This is the New York Museum of Art.

11:30.017 --> 11:32.508
I've been here many times.

11:32.895 --> 11:34.936
Many times.

11:34.975 --> 11:38.336
<i>OK, careful with that cover stone.</i>

11:38.336 --> 11:40.328
<i>Yes, Dr. Jackson.</i>

11:40.376 --> 11:42.203
No.

11:42.615 --> 11:44.442
Daniel?

11:44.495 --> 11:46.536
<i>Pull it this way.</i>

11:46.573 --> 11:50.453
I'm sorry.
This area isn't open to the public.

11:50.455 --> 11:51.735
<i>Careful.</i>

11:51.813 --> 11:55.018
- Jake, it's swinging a bit.
- Bring this in on the left.

11:58.013 --> 12:00.052
Daniel, what's going on?

12:01.932 --> 12:03.972
No, this can't be real.

12:04.013 --> 12:06.254
Who are these people?

12:06.292 --> 12:08.284
They're my parents.

12:08.331 --> 12:10.370
Move it towards the back. Careful.

12:10.491 --> 12:12.201
Watch it on your left.

12:12.251 --> 12:16.129
On your left. Jake, bring this in. Careful.

12:16.129 --> 12:18.123
Bring it down.
Let's look at the front.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.998
It's... It's swinging.

12:20.049 --> 12:22.006
It's OK. We'll be fine. Careful!

12:22.049 --> 12:24.256
No... No!

12:24.291 --> 12:25.620
A bit more level, Jake.

12:25.690 --> 12:26.804
OK, Jake...

12:26.889 --> 12:29.131
Get outta there, Mom!
Get outta there, Dad!

12:53.125 --> 12:56.605
This is too real. Every detail.

12:56.605 --> 12:58.847
All the players are here.

13:01.924 --> 13:04.001
Why should I go through this again?

13:04.044 --> 13:07.565
If someone has used technology
to send us to repair your history...

13:07.565 --> 13:08.893
That's just it!

13:08.965 --> 13:11.124
It's history. I can't change it.

13:11.804 --> 13:15.720
Remaining here, doing nothing,
will most certainly change nothing.

13:18.443 --> 13:19.855
I...

13:22.481 --> 13:24.355
Oh, God...

13:44.278 --> 13:46.852
Colonel, we should check those hedges.

13:46.879 --> 13:50.165
Negative. Stick to the plan, Captain.

14:02.118 --> 14:03.659
Group now!

14:09.477 --> 14:11.600
Jack, what are you doing?

14:15.956 --> 14:17.996
It's not part of the plan!

14:18.034 --> 14:19.030
John!

14:21.316 --> 14:22.774
Aargh!

14:35.673 --> 14:37.418
Come on, John!

14:38.634 --> 14:41.801
So much for satellite recon.

14:42.594 --> 14:43.590
Jack,...

14:44.393 --> 14:46.517
...take care of Barbara for me, man.

14:52.790 --> 14:54.831
Oh, God...

14:59.750 --> 15:01.791
Fall back!

15:21.149 --> 15:22.726
Lower your weapon, Captain.

15:25.427 --> 15:27.669
What the hell is going on here?

15:28.467 --> 15:31.746
What's with you, Jack?
Operation East Fly is go!

15:31.746 --> 15:32.528
No!

15:33.386 --> 15:35.509
You! Who are you?
Who are those people?

15:37.385 --> 15:40.665
There's no-one here but us!
Do you want a Section Eight, Jack?

15:40.665 --> 15:43.038
You must stop arguing...

15:43.066 --> 15:45.818
...and proceed with the mission.

15:45.826 --> 15:48.234
Allow me to introduce myself.

15:49.024 --> 15:50.982
I am the Keeper.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.624
The keeper of what?

15:53.664 --> 15:56.500
The Keeper of all that is around you.
Of all that is...

15:56.504 --> 15:58.544
...and all that... might be.

16:06.221 --> 16:09.302
Why do you wish us
to proceed with this mission?

16:09.302 --> 16:14.621
Because it is that...
which you have always wanted.

16:14.621 --> 16:17.292
You've got to be kidding me.

16:17.780 --> 16:22.500
<i>This was the most blown operation
I've ever been involved with.</i>

16:22.500 --> 16:25.980
Why would I want to watch my friends
be killed over and over again?

16:25.980 --> 16:31.023
You have always wished to do it again,
in order to do it... differently.

16:31.859 --> 16:33.686
We're going with or without you.

16:36.937 --> 16:38.515
See you.

16:39.179 --> 16:41.884
All right. Have it your way.

16:43.139 --> 16:45.463
<i>You must go with them.</i>

16:45.498 --> 16:49.498
It is the only way to evince the change
that you have desired for so many years.

16:49.498 --> 16:52.168
I can't change the outcome
if you change the rules.

16:52.177 --> 16:56.018
Do you not wish to save the lives
of your friends and comrades?

16:56.018 --> 16:57.216
If they were real.

16:57.298 --> 17:03.056
But there are so many...
fantastic variations that you can try.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.463
Perhaps this time...

17:05.493 --> 17:08.450
...you could try a different route.

17:21.613 --> 17:23.653
Sit down, Teal'c.

17:23.693 --> 17:25.733
We're not playing this game.

17:27.853 --> 17:30.807
Very well. Have it your way.

17:38.051 --> 17:43.296
I hope by doing nothing
we are taking the correct action, O'Neill.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.170
So do I.

17:53.411 --> 17:57.049
Daniel, I'm so sorry
you had to go through that again.

17:57.049 --> 17:58.627
I've been thinking.

17:58.690 --> 18:02.048
We were pulled into those things,
those machines, right?

18:02.048 --> 18:05.887
At first I thought they were
some sort of time-dilation machines.

18:05.887 --> 18:08.213
Sam, please... Just...

18:08.328 --> 18:10.737
Just tell me that this isn't real.

18:10.769 --> 18:15.247
No, I don't think it is. It isn't consistent
with logical theories of time travel.

18:15.247 --> 18:18.646
For example, you should be
seeing yourself here as a child,...

18:18.646 --> 18:20.888
...or become a child again.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.801
Daniel, I'm guessing here,...

18:23.846 --> 18:26.765
...but I think we're in
an advanced recreation...

18:26.766 --> 18:29.684
...being pumped into our minds
by those machines.

18:29.684 --> 18:32.640
<i>OK, careful with that cover stone.</i>

18:41.403 --> 18:42.603
I'm sorry.

18:42.683 --> 18:45.638
This area isn't open to the public.

18:46.723 --> 18:49.394
Daniel, I don't think we're actually here!

18:50.882 --> 18:52.163
Jake, it's swinging.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.320
Excuse me...

19:04.361 --> 19:07.601
Listen to me. Um...
You have to come out of there.

19:07.601 --> 19:10.354
Danny, go back outside.

19:11.082 --> 19:13.122
Danny?

19:14.279 --> 19:16.771
No. I-look,
you have to come out right now,...

19:16.798 --> 19:19.671
...because I... because I-I hurt myself.

19:19.679 --> 19:22.431
I hurt myself badly.
I think I've broken my leg.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.646
Come out right now
and take care of me!

19:24.679 --> 19:29.156
You can't be hurt badly. You're walking.
We'll be out in a minute. OK, sweetie?

19:29.156 --> 19:30.271
OK. Jake...

19:30.357 --> 19:32.066
No...

19:36.636 --> 19:37.634
No!

19:45.237 --> 19:47.277
<i>Come on! Help me with this.</i>

19:47.316 --> 19:49.355
Help me with this.

19:49.394 --> 19:50.426
<i>Dr Jackson!</i>

19:50.516 --> 19:52.758
Can you hear me?

19:52.795 --> 19:57.394
I can't see anything.
Here, help me with this.

19:57.394 --> 19:58.509
Lift it! Lift it!

20:03.472 --> 20:05.512
It's too heavy!

20:06.755 --> 20:09.127
Daniel, correct me if I'm wrong,...

20:09.153 --> 20:14.029
...but I'll bet when this really happened
you didn't have this audience.

20:15.392 --> 20:17.718
I think that we must be in some sort of...

20:17.751 --> 20:21.912
...really advanced simulation,
like a... virtual reality.

20:21.912 --> 20:23.951
It's the only explanation.

20:23.991 --> 20:29.431
Super! It takes my most tragic moment
and it plays it over and over again.

20:29.431 --> 20:31.388
Maybe that's your strongest memory.

20:31.430 --> 20:35.628
He called me Danny, like I'm still...
like I'm still a little kid.

20:35.630 --> 20:38.789
That's because that's how old you were
when this happened.

20:38.789 --> 20:41.460
You have taken on the role
of Daniel Jackson...

20:41.469 --> 20:43.961
...as a child in this... simulation.

20:44.348 --> 20:46.805
I used to replay this
over and over in my mind,...

20:46.827 --> 20:49.949
...trying to think what I could've done
to make a difference.

20:51.269 --> 20:52.680
OK.

20:52.749 --> 20:55.826
OK, so maybe that's the point.
Here's your chance.

20:55.827 --> 20:57.488
Is it not wonderful?

20:58.386 --> 21:00.924
Now you get the chance!

21:04.746 --> 21:06.538
I-I beg your pardon.

21:06.586 --> 21:08.080
The chance?

21:08.146 --> 21:10.222
To relive your momentous event.

21:10.266 --> 21:14.145
To try the plethora of variations
that have been weighing on your mind.

21:14.146 --> 21:17.101
To finally see if you can
make a difference.

21:19.263 --> 21:21.304
Who are you?

21:21.345 --> 21:23.384
Why, I am the Keeper, of course.

21:23.424 --> 21:24.539
The keeper of...?

21:24.625 --> 21:26.866
Of all that is, was, and will be
in this place.

21:26.904 --> 21:28.565
Where exactly are we?

21:28.623 --> 21:31.781
I believe you call this
the New York Museum of Art.

21:31.781 --> 21:33.941
No, no, no. Where are we in reality?

21:33.982 --> 21:36.105
Reality is in the eye of the beholder.

21:36.143 --> 21:40.662
You have always wished to go back
and do things differently.

21:40.662 --> 21:44.941
I have given you that opportunity.
Now, go! Make things right in this place.

21:44.941 --> 21:47.396
And how do I... How do I do that?

21:47.422 --> 21:50.210
Well, if I told you that
it wouldn't be any fun!

21:51.181 --> 21:52.344
Fun?!

21:52.422 --> 21:54.829
That's what you think this is for me?

21:54.859 --> 21:58.220
Fun, watching this... happen
again and again?

21:58.221 --> 22:01.659
There would be no pleasure from the gain
if there were no...

22:01.659 --> 22:03.237
...risk...

22:03.299 --> 22:05.209
...from the journey.

22:05.259 --> 22:08.344
<i>Careful with that cover stone.</i>

22:12.298 --> 22:13.959
<i>This way.</i>

22:26.376 --> 22:27.373
Danny.

22:29.935 --> 22:31.976
What are you doing?

22:32.496 --> 22:33.693
Come on.

22:33.775 --> 22:37.255
Danny Jackson! You stop this right now!

22:37.256 --> 22:39.213
Jake, gimme a hand here, please.

22:39.255 --> 22:40.584
No, no, no, no, no...

22:40.653 --> 22:42.278
- Bring it in.
- A bit more level.

22:42.335 --> 22:44.412
<i>Careful.</i>

22:44.453 --> 22:45.997
A little more level. Bring it in.

22:46.893 --> 22:48.269
No!

22:51.894 --> 22:54.894
God, no!

23:00.810 --> 23:03.349
Damn you! Stop this game now!

23:03.372 --> 23:06.124
What for? You haven't explored
all of your options yet.

23:06.131 --> 23:10.628
Well, obviously my options are infinite
and my solutions are zero. Now, stop it!

23:16.171 --> 23:18.211
I won't play any more.

23:20.210 --> 23:22.250
Ah, but you will.

23:22.289 --> 23:24.663
You will.

23:24.690 --> 23:27.145
<i>Careful with that cover stone.</i>

23:35.248 --> 23:37.288
Daniel, do you want me to...

23:37.327 --> 23:38.324
No.

23:38.409 --> 23:40.236
<i>Just bring it down.</i>

23:40.287 --> 23:41.450
Let's look at the front.

23:41.527 --> 23:43.435
- Bring it in.
- It's swinging.

23:43.488 --> 23:46.026
It's OK. It's fine. We'll be fine. Careful!

23:46.046 --> 23:47.920
You must try another alternative.

23:47.965 --> 23:50.006
No.

23:50.567 --> 23:55.605
You would allow your parents
to suffer this awful death?

23:55.605 --> 23:57.644
I won't play your game.

24:08.522 --> 24:12.022
You are indeed an obstinate race.

24:32.161 --> 24:33.156
You!

24:35.122 --> 24:37.162
You guys all right?

24:37.201 --> 24:40.319
I'm not really sure, to tell you the truth.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.443
What is this place?

24:42.480 --> 24:44.188
The New York Museum of Art.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.279
We think it's a simulation.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.397
I figure we're in some sort of
virtual reality world,...

24:49.398 --> 24:52.519
...created from our own minds,
or at least Daniel's.

24:52.519 --> 24:54.427
You are a very stubborn,...

24:54.478 --> 24:58.077
...unimaginative and non-competitive race.

24:58.077 --> 25:00.652
Why do you refuse...

25:00.676 --> 25:03.713
...to enjoy the opportunities
that I have given you?

25:05.157 --> 25:06.652
Enjoy?

25:07.356 --> 25:11.116
What makes you think I enjoy
watching my friends get killed?

25:11.116 --> 25:12.396
Or their parents die?

25:12.477 --> 25:15.994
You have both been given challenges
to be met and conquered.

25:15.994 --> 25:18.748
You have it in you.
Why will you not partake?

25:18.757 --> 25:20.880
Why will you not just let us go?

25:20.915 --> 25:23.324
Go where?! Where would you like to go?

25:23.355 --> 25:26.191
I can take you anywhere
you can remember.

25:26.193 --> 25:28.104
Anywhere you can imagine.

25:28.153 --> 25:30.990
OK. We want to go free!

25:30.992 --> 25:33.032
<i>So, we're right?</i>

25:33.074 --> 25:34.817
This is a... simulated world?

25:34.874 --> 25:38.232
It is a world completely inside
your minds.

25:38.232 --> 25:41.151
Channelled, coordinated
and administered...

25:41.153 --> 25:42.813
...by myself,...

25:42.872 --> 25:43.867
...the Keeper.

25:44.512 --> 25:46.386
But how? How does it work?

25:46.432 --> 25:49.711
I don't care how it works.
I just want outta here.

25:49.711 --> 25:51.170
I cannot do that.

25:51.232 --> 25:55.351
The devices that enwrap you serve to
nourish and stimulate your senses.

25:55.351 --> 25:57.972
The devices implanted in your brains...

25:57.991 --> 26:01.349
...channel experience and imagination
into and out of your minds.

26:01.349 --> 26:02.760
So we're trapped?

26:02.829 --> 26:06.309
With our brains hooked up like computers
to some sort of network?

26:06.309 --> 26:07.472
Yes!

26:07.549 --> 26:12.669
And your minds are very valuable
to my residents...

26:12.669 --> 26:16.028
...because you enrich
and add value to our own.

26:16.028 --> 26:17.226
<i>Wait.</i>

26:17.307 --> 26:21.027
How long have your... residents
been in this virtual world?

26:21.027 --> 26:24.267
Roughly one thousand of your years.

26:24.268 --> 26:28.906
We're not gonna stick around for
the next thousand of anyone's years!

26:28.906 --> 26:32.506
So, until we came along,
you've only had your own minds,...

26:32.506 --> 26:36.266
...your own experiences,
to provide scenarios for your virtual lives?

26:36.267 --> 26:38.556
You're beginning to understand.

26:38.586 --> 26:41.290
So, what, we're like...
We're like new software?

26:45.984 --> 26:49.104
Imagine being in a room for 1,000 years
with only five movies.

26:49.104 --> 26:52.544
How long could you watch them
until you were bored silly?

26:52.545 --> 26:56.423
What you wouldn't give
for just... four more.

26:56.423 --> 26:58.250
So, you're using our minds,...

26:58.302 --> 27:02.301
...our memories, imaginations, dreams,...
for some sort of programming?

27:02.301 --> 27:06.423
Actually, I can remove information
from only two of your minds.

27:06.423 --> 27:09.941
This species' mind seems to protect...

27:09.942 --> 27:12.148
...against output.
As does yours, madam.

27:12.180 --> 27:13.175
It does?

27:13.261 --> 27:16.900
Perhaps due to the change in your mind
that Jolinar of Malk-shur left behind.

27:16.900 --> 27:20.299
But fear not,
there is no block against input...

27:20.300 --> 27:21.415
...into your minds.

27:21.501 --> 27:23.459
You, too, can enjoy our adventures.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.959
And these two minds,...

27:25.019 --> 27:29.298
...they provide more than enough
rich experience and imagination...

27:29.298 --> 27:33.140
...to provide years of entertainment
for my residents.

27:33.141 --> 27:35.596
Well, I'm sorry.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.778
With all due respect to you fine folks,
I don't give a damn about...

27:40.778 --> 27:42.356
...residents!

27:42.417 --> 27:44.244
I just want to get us outta here.

27:44.298 --> 27:49.097
It is I that am sorry, for I am not able
to accommodate your request.

27:49.097 --> 27:53.215
I am sure you will be able to enjoy
the many adventures you will have here.

27:53.215 --> 27:55.837
Why are your people in here anyway?

27:55.855 --> 27:59.013
Why not go out and get some
new experiences of your own?

27:59.015 --> 28:01.092
Live some new experiences?

28:01.135 --> 28:03.259
We cannot leave our chambers.

28:03.296 --> 28:05.288
The world outside is uninhabitable.

28:05.335 --> 28:08.207
It has been poisoned and desecrated.

28:08.214 --> 28:12.173
You are mistaken.
Your planet is a fertile garden world.

28:12.173 --> 28:13.965
It is you who are mistaken,...

28:14.013 --> 28:15.424
...my alien friend.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.692
Our planet was destroyed
by a chemical disaster...

28:18.692 --> 28:21.528
...1,022 years ago.

28:21.534 --> 28:26.172
We were victims of our own technology
advancing faster than we could control it.

28:26.172 --> 28:30.692
At that time, the few of us left placed our
physical bodies in suspended animation.

28:30.692 --> 28:34.144
Good news. Your planet
seems to have regenerated itself.

28:36.051 --> 28:40.650
This is not true!
I monitor all conditions at all times.

28:40.650 --> 28:42.607
Your monitoring systems are wrong.

28:42.650 --> 28:44.773
It is beautiful out there.

28:44.809 --> 28:45.806
Of course,...

28:45.888 --> 28:49.250
...you already knew that, didn't you?

28:49.250 --> 28:51.539
The question is,...

28:51.568 --> 28:54.848
...why don't you want them to know?

28:54.849 --> 28:58.528
Residents must not leave
the environment!

28:58.528 --> 29:01.316
The outside world is uninhabitable!

29:01.327 --> 29:05.208
- Who made you the warden here, huh?
- I do not understand.

29:05.208 --> 29:08.567
Why are you the one running things here?

29:08.567 --> 29:10.976
The environment is my design.

29:11.007 --> 29:14.125
I am its creator, its Keeper.

29:14.125 --> 29:17.827
So, if your... residents leave,...

29:18.406 --> 29:20.446
...you lose control.

29:26.525 --> 29:28.647
That man is lying to you, folks.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.142
He's got you imprisoned in your own...

29:33.923 --> 29:35.548
Well, that's good.

29:37.523 --> 29:41.721
That's fair. Send them to where
they can't hear the truth. Good.

29:41.721 --> 29:43.217
I will not allow you...

29:43.282 --> 29:45.075
...to poison their minds.

29:45.122 --> 29:47.578
Um, if you keep us here,...

29:47.602 --> 29:50.761
...you won't be able to prevent us
from interacting with them.

29:50.762 --> 29:54.080
I mean, especially if we're supposed to be
new software for them.

29:54.080 --> 29:57.201
Very well. You weren't wanted here
any more anyway.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.028
We're out.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.872
Whoa!

30:05.921 --> 30:08.163
Wait, didn't that seem a little too easy?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.267
Yes, it did. Let's go home.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.201
They all have small puncture wounds...

30:21.238 --> 30:24.108
...in their temples, spinal cords,...

30:24.117 --> 30:26.526
...and several abdominal areas.

30:26.557 --> 30:28.431
Meaning what?

30:28.477 --> 30:31.347
The machines you described
were sustaining your lives.

30:31.357 --> 30:34.111
Providing you with oxygen, feeding you,...

30:34.116 --> 30:37.476
...and, from the sound of it,
controlling your nervous system.

30:37.476 --> 30:39.516
But is there any permanent damage?

30:39.556 --> 30:42.308
No. Not that I can see.
Pupil dilation is bang on.

30:42.316 --> 30:45.898
Reflexes are as they should be.
Everything seems fine to me.

30:48.434 --> 30:52.314
Jack, we should go back to the planet
and free those people.

30:52.315 --> 30:54.936
I'm not sure it's any of our business,
frankly.

30:54.953 --> 30:55.950
I concur.

30:56.034 --> 30:58.904
Who are we to judge how someone
on another planet lives?

30:58.913 --> 31:02.074
But the people are in those machines
under false pretences.

31:02.074 --> 31:04.647
The Keeper is lying to them
about what's outside.

31:04.673 --> 31:06.584
OK, if I may weigh in here.

31:06.633 --> 31:10.632
All evidence suggests that the machines
clinically sustain those people.

31:10.632 --> 31:12.292
Removing them could be like...

31:12.352 --> 31:14.510
...taking a patient off life-support.

31:14.550 --> 31:18.392
It sounds to me
like we have to get more information...

31:18.392 --> 31:20.516
...to make this decision, folks.

31:20.551 --> 31:22.711
The only way to gain more information...

31:22.750 --> 31:26.028
...would be to venture back into
the artificial world of P7J-989.

31:26.029 --> 31:28.521
Then, that's exactly what I want you to do.

31:32.030 --> 31:34.070
Uh,...

31:34.390 --> 31:35.385
...General,...

31:35.470 --> 31:37.048
...without meaning,...

31:37.108 --> 31:40.667
<i>.. this time, to sound like a smart-ass,...</i>

31:40.667 --> 31:42.708
...are you cracked?

31:42.827 --> 31:44.867
Folks, I don't need to tell you...

31:44.907 --> 31:47.826
...how valuable a resource
this planet could be for us.

31:47.828 --> 31:53.267
Their technology is far beyond our own.
The kind of technology that justifies...

31:53.267 --> 31:55.425
...this entire programme.

31:55.467 --> 31:59.306
- Going back there could be hazardous.
- I fail to see how.

31:59.307 --> 32:02.705
It's an artificial environment.
Can you actually die in there?

32:02.705 --> 32:03.903
We don't know.

32:03.986 --> 32:07.546
I'm a little more concerned about
being trapped there, sir.

32:07.546 --> 32:08.874
You got out before.

32:08.944 --> 32:12.423
There is no guarantee
we'd be able to extract ourselves again.

32:12.423 --> 32:14.463
OK. I'll tell you what.

32:14.503 --> 32:16.794
If you don't come out in one week,...

32:16.825 --> 32:19.742
...I'll send in SG-2 to pull you out.

32:19.744 --> 32:21.951
Besides, what's so bad about
being in there?

32:21.983 --> 32:26.104
It sounds to me like you can experience
all sorts of fascinating things.

32:26.104 --> 32:28.891
- Like watching old friends and...
- Parents?

32:28.902 --> 32:31.394
Family getting killed over and over again?

32:31.423 --> 32:34.294
Or seeing Major Kawalsky alive and well.

32:34.301 --> 32:37.256
Who knows, Colonel?
Maybe you could even see your son.

32:37.261 --> 32:41.221
Dr. Jackson, perhaps you could visit
the ancient worlds you've always...

32:41.221 --> 32:46.263
...wondered about. Go anywhere your
memories or imaginations want to go.

32:51.818 --> 32:53.858
That's enough.

32:54.859 --> 32:58.617
Let's just have a little look here, shall we?

32:58.617 --> 33:00.491
What are you doing, Colonel?

33:00.539 --> 33:03.162
- I'm looking for the edges of the mask.
- What?

33:03.179 --> 33:05.385
You're not the real General Hammond.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.699
Sit down, Colonel!

33:06.778 --> 33:09.269
I don't think so, bucko. The jig's up.

33:09.298 --> 33:11.125
- We're on to you.
- What?!

33:11.178 --> 33:14.214
- We're still on P7J-989.
- Oh, you betcha.

33:15.298 --> 33:17.539
This is just a new game, brought to you...

33:17.576 --> 33:19.535
...by our good friend, the Keeper.

33:19.576 --> 33:22.151
You are way out of line, Colonel!

33:22.176 --> 33:25.816
You could be having a nervous reaction
to the machines. We'll run tests.

33:25.816 --> 33:29.232
No, you should get us out of these
damn machines is what you should do!

33:31.375 --> 33:32.406
Oh, what?!

33:32.494 --> 33:34.535
Colonel, you're testing my patience.

33:34.576 --> 33:36.450
I will give you one final chance...

33:36.493 --> 33:40.614
...to follow my orders, and rejoin
the residents of the artificial world.

33:40.615 --> 33:43.189
Residents?
That's what the Keeper called them.

33:45.094 --> 33:47.134
Are you going back in or not, Colonel?

33:47.173 --> 33:48.501
I'm already in!

33:48.574 --> 33:50.317
Place SG-1 under arrest!

33:50.373 --> 33:53.375
Put them in isolation
where they can speak to no-one!

34:08.811 --> 34:09.842
O'Neill,...

34:09.929 --> 34:13.088
...you seem quite confident
that we are not on Earth.

34:13.090 --> 34:15.130
Because we're not!

34:15.849 --> 34:20.047
Did that sound like the real
General Hammond to anyone?

34:20.047 --> 34:23.648
It is my understanding that
we could only experience past events.

34:23.648 --> 34:27.449
The Keeper said we could experience
anything we can remember or imagine.

34:27.449 --> 34:30.864
We're still on PJ7-989.

34:32.248 --> 34:34.371
It's a fake environment.

34:35.327 --> 34:37.367
Is that really so bad?

34:38.965 --> 34:42.668
I mean, come on,
haven't you people missed me at all?

34:43.606 --> 34:45.811
Why are you resisting this?

34:45.847 --> 34:48.516
Think of all the fun
we could have together.

34:48.525 --> 34:50.768
Dr. Jackson, you gotta admit,...

34:50.806 --> 34:52.597
...I used to make you laugh.

34:52.646 --> 34:56.764
Colonel, who else are you gonna get
to play street hockey with...

34:56.764 --> 34:59.766
...who can kick your butt the way I can?

35:01.326 --> 35:02.701
Captain Carter,...

35:02.764 --> 35:07.163
...think what it would be like
to never grow old.

35:07.163 --> 35:08.824
Cos you never do here.

35:08.884 --> 35:10.923
Who are you?

35:10.963 --> 35:12.623
Who am I?

35:12.681 --> 35:15.518
Colonel, are you telling me
you don't remember me?

35:15.523 --> 35:17.231
I'm hurt.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.860
- I'm really hurt.
- No, no.

35:18.922 --> 35:22.291
I know who you're pretending to be.

35:22.681 --> 35:24.722
But who are you, really?

35:26.081 --> 35:28.121
Are you the Keeper?

35:28.161 --> 35:30.996
Nah... Not me.

35:31.001 --> 35:32.579
Then what?

35:32.641 --> 35:35.311
Some kind of projection or...?

35:35.800 --> 35:37.840
Because you're not real.

35:40.639 --> 35:44.389
And if you're not real,
you won't mind this.

35:55.717 --> 35:56.880
Hello.

35:59.438 --> 36:01.514
We have been looking for you.

36:01.556 --> 36:05.195
Please, tell us
what you began to tell us before.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.985
About what it is like outside.

36:07.996 --> 36:10.702
It is, in fact, quite agreeable outside.

36:10.715 --> 36:14.036
- The poison is gone?
- Everything is not dead?

36:14.036 --> 36:17.155
No. Uh, quite the opposite.
Everything is... blooming.

36:17.554 --> 36:19.382
How can that be?

36:19.434 --> 36:21.806
The Keeper tells us it is dangerous.

36:21.835 --> 36:25.793
Well... The... the Keeper lies.

36:25.793 --> 36:28.331
How can we trust these creatures
above the Keeper,...

36:28.353 --> 36:31.224
...who has cared for us for so long?

36:33.233 --> 36:35.273
Tell you what...

36:36.913 --> 36:39.405
Come with us. We'll show you.

36:48.032 --> 36:49.989
Excuse me.

36:51.590 --> 36:53.215
Where are we going?

36:53.271 --> 36:56.936
Back through the gate
to show 'em what their planet looks like.

36:58.590 --> 37:00.630
In our memories.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.925
Before the virtual reality.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.630
Leave me alone.

37:12.307 --> 37:15.179
<i>Unauthorised Stargate activation.</i>

37:15.188 --> 37:16.469
Shutting down the gate.

37:18.827 --> 37:19.775
SG-1,...

37:19.867 --> 37:22.358
...you are trying my patience!

37:26.385 --> 37:28.425
Daniel, with me!

38:18.380 --> 38:20.420
You think we're really out this time?

38:22.860 --> 38:24.318
Hey!

38:35.697 --> 38:37.820
Please, do not hurt me.

38:37.856 --> 38:39.481
I meant you no harm.

38:39.538 --> 38:42.896
Understand, my people's existence...

38:42.896 --> 38:45.103
...has become stagnant.

38:45.137 --> 38:47.628
I wanted... only good for them.

38:47.657 --> 38:50.693
How long have you been coming out
to tend this garden?

38:50.695 --> 38:52.025
Lovely, is it not?

38:52.096 --> 38:53.721
How long?

38:55.295 --> 38:58.250
Oh,... many, many years.

38:58.255 --> 39:00.295
Then why do you lie to your people?

39:00.335 --> 39:02.661
Why not give them the option
to come out here?

39:02.695 --> 39:07.335
Because it was our kind that damaged
the planet in the first place.

39:07.335 --> 39:10.612
If I let them out,
they will only hurt it again.

39:10.612 --> 39:12.106
You're kidding?

39:13.894 --> 39:16.351
Perhaps they will not make
the same mistakes.

39:16.373 --> 39:18.864
You're big on giving people
a second chance!

39:18.893 --> 39:23.411
No-one is preventing them from leaving.
Portals, such as the ones you've used,...

39:23.411 --> 39:25.369
...are everywhere within.

39:25.411 --> 39:28.731
We could have left at any time?
We just had to go through a door?

39:28.731 --> 39:32.090
Anyone may leave at any time.
Portals are always open.

39:32.090 --> 39:35.791
Of course, people have to know they exist
to use them.

39:36.730 --> 39:39.483
Which you have now shown them.

39:39.489 --> 39:42.929
And they have to know
that there's somewhere to go.

39:42.931 --> 39:45.255
And you have told them that.

39:46.730 --> 39:50.063
You have ruined everything.
Poisoned their minds.

39:51.208 --> 39:53.081
The damage is done.

40:16.885 --> 40:19.922
Again, we thank you. You have given us...

40:19.925 --> 40:23.083
...a whole new world of beauty
and future experiences.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.492
Well, you've still got a lot of work to do.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.896
But we'll send along some supplies...

40:27.923 --> 40:30.213
- ...to get you started.
- They are ruining everything!

40:30.244 --> 40:32.452
They are actually picking the flowers!

40:36.402 --> 40:38.811
This is real this time, isn't it?

40:40.242 --> 40:42.235
Do not pull that!

40:42.284 --> 40:45.451
You are ruining the garden!

40:47.762 --> 40:49.969
I told you they would ruin everything.

40:50.001 --> 40:51.793
First the garden,...

40:51.840 --> 40:54.331
...next the entire planet!

40:55.081 --> 40:57.121
<i>It's real.</i>

40:57.721 --> 41:00.592
You are ruining the garden!

41:03.800 --> 41:05.840
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>
