13:41.400 --> 13:42.767
VERONICA:
Oh, you're not the only one!

13:42.767 --> 13:46.367
Uh, Kev, was Dad
at the Alibi last night?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.100
Uh, yeah.

13:48.100 --> 13:52.667
But he was hammered.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.233
I'm talking
hold-on-to-the-grass-

13:55.233 --> 13:56.667
so-you-don't-fall-off-the-Earth
hammered.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.633
You see him
at last call?

13:59.633 --> 14:01.567
No.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.767
Which is pretty weird,
'cause he usually hangs out

14:03.767 --> 14:05.266
to sink the other
drinkers' dregs.

14:05.266 --> 14:07.233
Thanks.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.700
Ready?

14:08.700 --> 14:10.233
(laughing)

14:17.533 --> 14:21.266
You okay?

14:21.266 --> 14:22.567
I think Dad's missing.

14:22.567 --> 14:23.533

Hey, Ted. Yeah, yeah.

Hey, Jonna.
It's Debbie.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.500
Have you seen Frank
since last night?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.100
No? Since Michael Jackson died?

14:29.100 --> 14:31.367
FIONA:
I was wondering if you had
seen him since...
All right.

14:31.367 --> 14:33.700
...since last night
at the Alibi.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.266
Sorry about the door,
and the window.

14:35.266 --> 14:37.333
Yeah, yeah, anyways,
I was wondering,
have you seen Frank...

14:37.333 --> 14:40.700
Hey, did you get an
admission into the E.R.
last night or this morning?

14:40.700 --> 14:43.266
Last night? No?
Keep and eye out...

14:43.266 --> 14:45.367
Hey, can you just...?
I will look it up.

14:45.367 --> 14:46.400
VERONICA:
Shit!

14:46.400 --> 14:48.000
What the fuck?!

14:49.100 --> 14:50.433
Motherfucker.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.266
Stop... Wendy-Wendy!

14:54.266 --> 14:55.667

Hello? Hello?
Wendy.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.400
VERONICA:
Stop! Stop!

14:57.400 --> 15:00.100
Hey. Are you still there?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.667
Wendy, Wendy.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.033
Oh, you didn't?

15:03.033 --> 15:04.233
Okay, thanks anyway.

15:04.233 --> 15:06.767
No. Know if it's
a boy or girl yet?

15:06.767 --> 15:08.000
(dial tone)

15:08.000 --> 15:09.734
What is your problem?

15:09.734 --> 15:11.600
I'm supposed to call Ahmed
before work

15:11.600 --> 15:13.233
and I can't find my cell.
My cell's gone.

15:13.233 --> 15:15.266
Help me look for my cell.
It's gone.
I lent Lip your cell

15:15.266 --> 15:16.266
so he could call around,

15:16.266 --> 15:17.567
see anybody knew
where Frank went.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.734
Great. So now both my bills
are being run up over there.

15:19.734 --> 15:21.166
Your bills? Hello?

15:21.166 --> 15:22.767
I work my ass off around here,
not just you.

15:22.767 --> 15:25.400
Oh, there's the computer.
Don't let me stop you.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.667
It's after 10:00,

15:26.667 --> 15:27.700
Frank is missing,
you cheap prick.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.133
And you need to see somebody.

15:29.133 --> 15:31.400
Normal guys fall asleep
after sex. Not Kev, oh, no.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.100
Why can't they get
their own fucking phone?
No fucking money!

15:34.100 --> 15:35.367
Yeah, well, me neither
at this rate.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.633
I love you.

15:39.367 --> 15:41.367

16:10.166 --> 16:11.333
Anything?

16:11.333 --> 16:13.367
Nobody's seen him
since last night.

16:13.367 --> 16:15.500
(whimpers)

16:15.500 --> 16:17.767
Hey, hey,
don't worry, Debs.

16:17.767 --> 16:20.266
We're gonna find him,
okay?

16:20.266 --> 16:23.500
We split up.

Frank's always missing.
That's what I said.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.367
I mean, he's probably
just sleeping it off
at a friend's place.

17:40.367 --> 17:43.200
He hasn't got any friends.
Who'd give him a bed?

Come on, we've found
him in Dumpsters,

17:44.767 --> 17:47.200

Mrs. Lutski's bathtub.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.033

No more freebies from me, like

Hey, take it easy.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.166

all right?

18:07.166 --> 18:09.567
Look, Frank isn't far, okay?

18:09.567 --> 18:11.166
He never goes far.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.467
I know, but it's
the last Friday.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.100
Last Friday? So what?

18:15.600 --> 18:19.467
Disability check day.

18:19.467 --> 18:21.100
Oh, Jesus.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.400
Fuck me.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.266
Hey, Jess.

18:24.266 --> 18:26.567
Uh, Frank Gallagher--
did he leave with anybody

18:26.567 --> 18:28.166
when we kicked him
out last night?

18:28.166 --> 18:29.300
Name me one person

18:29.300 --> 18:31.633
who would be caught dead
with him in that condition.

18:31.633 --> 18:32.767
And Steve was definitely gone
by then,

18:32.767 --> 18:33.767
so Frank wasn't with him.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.367
Anybody seen Frank the Plank?

18:35.367 --> 18:36.700
Which Steve?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.166
You know, Steve-Steve.

Friendly enough.

18:41.233 --> 18:42.567

18:42.567 --> 18:44.367

18:44.367 --> 18:46.300

18:46.300 --> 18:47.734
Yeah.

MAN (on TV):
Breaking news now
about a body that was found

18:50.300 --> 18:52.133
on the Southside of the city.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.467
KEVIN:
Is that over by
Halsted station?

18:54.467 --> 18:57.200
I broke my collarbone falling
down those station steps.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.467
After my very first taste
of another woman's tongue.

19:00.467 --> 19:02.767

Tony said he'd put out
a bulletin.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.600
He never misses that check.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.166
We waits on the corner.
Practically tackles the mailman

19:06.166 --> 19:08.266
before he can get out
of his little jeep.

19:08.266 --> 19:10.266
We've all known for years
it could end this way.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.433
We don't know
anything's happened.

19:12.433 --> 19:14.033
All the O.D.'s
and pumped stomachs.

19:14.033 --> 19:15.100
The time he passed out
on the tracks.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.767
The El tracks?
Almost lost a hand.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.500
Hey, V.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.467
Hey, Ian.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.233
Um, sorry, Fiona.

a body under the tracks

19:55.200 --> 19:56.500
on Halsted.
What?

19:56.500 --> 19:58.000
It's not him, Debs,
or the police

19:58.000 --> 19:59.333

19:59.333 --> 20:00.600

make sense, Debbie?

Why would your dad be over
on Halsted when he lives in
the opposite direction?

20:09.700 --> 20:11.367
Depends. How was he looking

20:11.367 --> 20:13.133

Alibi Room last night, Steve?

20:13.133 --> 20:16.100

Uh, 10:00, 10:30.

20:18.734 --> 20:21.100
I went to apologize,
bought him a drink,
then I went home.

Hey, can I talk

24:58.133 --> 24:59.533
Kev has a passport.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.600
What good does that do?

25:02.600 --> 25:03.633
You could drive up there,

25:03.633 --> 25:05.333
help him with the paperwork
at the embassy.

25:05.333 --> 25:06.467
Pick up a pile
of cheap pharmaceuticals,

25:06.467 --> 25:08.333
sell 'em to the
local geezers

25:08.333 --> 25:10.200
and the old folks
at my nursing home.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.667
Could I...?

25:11.667 --> 25:13.367
Fuck, V...

25:13.367 --> 25:15.066
No offense,
Tony.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:15.066 --> 25:16.600
The car's not insured.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.633
Border patrol asks for proof
of insurance to get back in.

25:19.633 --> 25:21.734
I wind up in the loony bin
next to Frank.

25:21.734 --> 25:23.266
Yeah.

25:23.266 --> 25:24.433
You're good.

25:37.767 --> 25:39.500
You okay?

25:39.500 --> 25:42.166
How'd you get my dad
to Toronto?

25:42.166 --> 25:45.433
Me? Are you kidding?

25:46.600 --> 25:49.533
Canadian health warnings.

25:51.667 --> 25:54.667
I, uh, smuggled him
over the border

25:54.667 --> 25:56.266
in the trunk
of my car.

25:56.266 --> 25:57.700
Uh, they didn't
check going in.

25:57.700 --> 25:59.467
How'd you get him
in the trunk?

25:59.467 --> 26:01.000
He was so plastered, he would
have jumped into a coffin.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.300
And why Canada?

26:03.300 --> 26:05.633
Uh, I had to run a car
to Detroit.

26:05.633 --> 26:08.233
Plan was dump him someplace
weird in Michigan,

26:08.233 --> 26:09.767
Flint maybe.

26:09.767 --> 26:11.734
When I saw the signs
for Toronto,

26:11.734 --> 26:14.367
the idea kind
of just...

26:14.367 --> 26:16.133
snowballed.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.700
And you think it-it's funny?

26:21.700 --> 26:23.300
No. Funny would have
been Newfoundland.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.400
Because he took
a swing at you?

26:25.400 --> 26:26.467
No, because he's
got a family

26:26.467 --> 26:28.567
that he doesn't
give a shit about.

26:28.567 --> 26:30.467
Smashing Ian
in the face.

26:30.467 --> 26:31.633
Uh...

26:33.500 --> 26:35.700
What my dad is,
what my family is,

26:35.700 --> 26:37.467
has fuck all to do with you!

26:40.567 --> 26:43.700
You left him there--
you get him back.

26:55.133 --> 26:57.300
What the hell is that?

26:58.600 --> 27:00.300
Our ride.

27:03.333 --> 27:05.166
There's no fucking way
I'm driving all the way

27:05.166 --> 27:06.300
to Toronto
in this piece of shit.

27:06.300 --> 27:07.433
We'll take
turns driving,

27:07.433 --> 27:09.200
watch some movies
on the flat screen,

27:09.200 --> 27:10.233
make some mojitos, sleep.

27:10.233 --> 27:11.734
We'll have Frank
back by morning.

27:11.734 --> 27:13.200
Yeah, and how are we supposed
to get him across the border

27:13.200 --> 27:16.400
without a passport?
Kyle.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.333
KEVIN:
You get through customs
in this before?

27:18.333 --> 27:20.333
A couple hundred times.
Oh, yeah, with what?

27:20.333 --> 27:21.533
Grass mostly.

27:21.533 --> 27:23.767
Sometimes OxyContin,
sometimes illegal aliens.

27:28.300 --> 27:31.767

Hmm?

27:51.100 --> 27:54.467
Yeah, um, I think I'm going
to finish my calculus

27:54.467 --> 27:56.533
homework upstairs.

28:01.633 --> 28:04.200
Thanks for all your help
with Frank.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.400
Sure. Happy to.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.166
Family, you know.

28:08.233 --> 28:10.433
There's coffee in the pot.

28:10.433 --> 28:12.467
Probably a couple
decades old, but...

28:12.467 --> 28:14.100
Thanks.

28:14.100 --> 28:17.000
So is this Steve guy
a fixture now?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.633
Just somebody I met.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.767
CYO Basketball League
Awards Banquet is next week

28:24.767 --> 28:26.166
at St. Stephens.

28:26.166 --> 28:29.233
There's a chance I might
get Coach of the Year.

28:29.233 --> 28:31.100
That's terrific, Tony.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.700
I bet you're a great coach.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.667
Well, they're eight, so mostly
it's just helping them

28:35.667 --> 28:37.400
get the ball anywhere
near the basket.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.734
No, they're lucky
to have you.

28:39.734 --> 28:41.467
One of the kids
always licks the ball

28:41.467 --> 28:45.333
before he takes a shot.
I have no idea why.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.066
I was hoping you'd come.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.500
To the banquet?

28:52.500 --> 28:54.166
Mrs. Rudolian
and Mrs. Ignacio

28:54.166 --> 28:56.700
are doing the food,
so there'll be all the kielbasa

28:56.700 --> 28:58.667
and Bolognese ragu you can eat.

28:58.667 --> 29:00.633
I know--

29:00.633 --> 29:03.266
hard to turn down
an invitation like that, right?

29:03.266 --> 29:05.233
Catholic League ladies
might talk.

29:05.233 --> 29:06.667
Screw the Catholic ladies.

29:06.667 --> 29:08.400
I haven't set foot in there

29:08.400 --> 29:10.367
since they tossed me out
of the choir.

29:10.367 --> 29:12.734
(over radio):
Tony, we have a call.
Work.

29:12.734 --> 29:13.767
So Thursday?

29:15.100 --> 29:17.166
Can I think about it?

29:17.166 --> 29:18.200

31:44.400 --> 31:47.000
(knocking on door)

31:47.000 --> 31:49.500
You decent?

31:49.500 --> 31:51.734
Thought you might
be thirsty.

31:51.734 --> 31:53.233
It's Canadian.

31:53.233 --> 31:54.266
There's more in fridge.

31:54.266 --> 31:56.000
I asked Veronica to get it.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.200
I don't want anything
Canadian in this house,

31:59.200 --> 32:01.000
from this point on.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.700
There's no hot water.

32:02.700 --> 32:05.700
For fuck's sake!

32:09.533 --> 32:10.700
Disability.

32:10.700 --> 32:14.066
It's Saturday.
Bank's close at 12:00.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.633
Clean clothes,
top of the dryer.

32:19.734 --> 32:21.734
Don't ever hit
one of my kids again.

32:21.734 --> 32:23.033
Your kids? They're my...

32:23.033 --> 32:24.767
Never again.

32:29.233 --> 32:30.400
Is he still here?

32:30.400 --> 32:32.166
Who, Steve?

32:32.166 --> 32:33.567
He's probably still outside.

32:33.567 --> 32:36.300
Well, tell him he's not welcome
in my house.

32:36.300 --> 32:38.133
He's the one who got you back.

32:38.133 --> 32:40.033
(sputtering)

32:40.033 --> 32:42.667
Why would he do that? Hmm?

32:42.667 --> 32:45.633
When I woke up, in Toronto,

32:45.633 --> 32:49.734
in a park, looking like
a fucking homeless tweaker,

32:49.734 --> 32:52.333
all I could smell
was Drakkar Noir.

32:52.333 --> 32:55.533
Middle of a park--
Drakkar Noir.

32:55.533 --> 32:58.066
I just spent five hours with him
in that camper.

32:58.066 --> 33:01.066
Same fucking smell!

33:15.467 --> 33:18.467
Wish you'd taken a camera.

33:18.467 --> 33:20.500
Total shithole.

33:20.500 --> 33:24.266
Hey, what's urine and
Canadian beer have
in common?

33:24.266 --> 33:25.633
They both come
from pussies.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.266
Bet you're the only
one who missed me.

33:29.266 --> 33:30.734
No, 'cause Carl said,

33:30.734 --> 33:33.633
"The cable's off.
Where's the ladder?"

33:33.633 --> 33:36.100
And Lip said,
"Dad's the only one

33:36.100 --> 33:38.233
who knows what to do
on the pole."

33:38.233 --> 33:40.100
Did you see Toronto?

33:40.100 --> 33:41.266
Yeah.

33:41.266 --> 33:42.467
CN Tower?

33:42.467 --> 33:43.667
Christ, yeah!

33:43.667 --> 33:47.233
You can see right across all
of Canada from the top.

33:47.233 --> 33:49.133
I didn't stay up
there long, though.

33:49.133 --> 33:51.633
Don't know what
Canadian women are into,

33:51.633 --> 33:53.266
but they couldn't take
their eyes off me,

33:53.266 --> 33:56.233
like, "Hey, I'm
having that guy."

33:56.233 --> 33:59.633
Got a bit unnerving, so
I headed on back down.

34:04.734 --> 34:08.066
Bits of Canada
are beautiful.

34:08.066 --> 34:10.367
You just have to know
your way around.

34:10.367 --> 34:11.600
Do you now?

34:11.600 --> 34:13.066
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

34:13.066 --> 34:15.033
Every inch.

34:16.734 --> 34:19.200
Hey, I gotta go cash a check.

34:19.200 --> 34:21.266
Make me a sandwich
for when I get back, okay?

34:21.266 --> 34:22.700
Okay.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.567
(clunk)
BOY: Ow!

34:46.567 --> 34:49.333
(bike clatters)

34:53.433 --> 34:55.000
(knocking)

34:55.000 --> 34:56.700
Davey, it's me, Frank!
Come on, man!

34:56.700 --> 34:58.400
Open up! Let me in!

34:58.400 --> 35:02.166
Just until I find
another place to stay.

35:02.166 --> 35:03.166
No way, Frank.

35:03.166 --> 35:04.734
I promised Mary,
never again!

35:04.734 --> 35:07.033
We had to burn
that mattress.

35:07.033 --> 35:08.400
Come on, Davey!
I'll sleep on the floor.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.233
Definitely not!
We got carpet now.

35:15.734 --> 35:17.567
Moving out again?

35:17.567 --> 35:19.700
Fuck off!

35:19.700 --> 35:21.500
I don't like the way

35:21.500 --> 35:23.667
I'm being talked to
around my own house.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.300
Like what?

35:25.300 --> 35:26.734
"You never got
me this, Dad.

35:26.734 --> 35:28.400
When can I have
that, Dad?"

35:28.400 --> 35:29.700
Yak, yak, fucking yak.

35:29.700 --> 35:31.700
All six of you.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.333
Never mind
I'm a single parent!

35:33.333 --> 35:36.166
Never mind you wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for me!

35:36.166 --> 35:39.467
Surround sound bitching is
the only thanks I get.

35:39.467 --> 35:41.433
Life is hard,
we all know that.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.100
Money is harder.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.734
I can only stretch it so far.

35:44.734 --> 35:47.767
Do you even know how much
we spend a week on groceries?

35:47.767 --> 35:50.233
Too much.
That's how much.

35:50.233 --> 35:51.400
120 bucks.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.767
Fiona pays $70.

35:52.767 --> 35:54.767
Me and Ian go in
$25 each.

35:54.767 --> 35:58.500
Plus gas, electric, taxes.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.066
We pay that.

36:00.066 --> 36:03.467
About time you contribute.

36:03.467 --> 36:05.633
Do you know how much you spend
a month at the Alibi?

36:05.633 --> 36:07.200
None of your damn business!

36:07.200 --> 36:09.300
Over $700.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.633
That's Kevin, right?

36:12.633 --> 36:16.300
My friend Kevin telling
you that behind my back?

36:16.300 --> 36:18.633
Well, he's screwed
the golden goose now.

36:18.633 --> 36:23.433
Watch what happens to his tips
when I boycott the Alibi.

36:23.433 --> 36:24.433
And go where?

36:24.433 --> 36:25.433
The Lamplight.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.367
You're barred.

36:26.367 --> 36:28.266
The Fountain.
Barred.

36:28.266 --> 36:29.467
Elmo's Head.

36:29.467 --> 36:33.367
Burned to the ground
two weeks ago. Arson.

36:33.367 --> 36:35.433
I don't need Kev
to tell me.

36:35.433 --> 36:37.166
I check your pockets
every night.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.233
See...

36:42.266 --> 36:43.767
You better run!

36:43.767 --> 36:46.567
FRANK:
Take it easy!

36:46.567 --> 36:47.767
(Frank yells)

36:49.500 --> 36:51.667
(body thuds, Frank grunts)

36:54.533 --> 36:56.266
Forget you owe him money?

36:56.266 --> 36:58.000
Everybody thinks
I owe 'em money!

36:58.000 --> 37:00.100
You pawned
his flat screen.

37:00.100 --> 37:03.000
I've been nothing but a friend
to that fat jigga prick.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.633
And his microwave.

37:04.633 --> 37:06.533
I won't say it twice--
go home.

37:06.533 --> 37:07.567
What?

37:07.567 --> 37:09.400
I won't say it twice...

37:12.266 --> 37:13.533
Okay...

37:13.533 --> 37:15.233
people are laughing.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.700
But they only thought
Toronto was funny

37:16.700 --> 37:19.767
once they knew
you were okay.

37:19.767 --> 37:22.233
I didn't split
like your mom did.

37:22.233 --> 37:23.600
I could of.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.533
Let the state figure out what
to do with all six of you.

37:26.533 --> 37:27.700
But I didn't.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.000
And bars weren't...

37:29.000 --> 37:31.133
You ask anybody.
A beer...

37:31.133 --> 37:32.567
once in a while,
and that's it.

37:32.567 --> 37:34.467
Three, I'd be on the floor.

37:34.467 --> 37:36.600
And they all thought
it was funny then

37:36.600 --> 37:38.433
that I couldn't knock 'em back.

37:38.433 --> 37:41.233
You can't win, you know?

37:41.233 --> 37:44.433
Your mom just takes off,
you're all looking at me.

37:44.433 --> 37:47.400
Six kids to keep track of
when you've never had

37:47.400 --> 37:48.633
to do that stuff.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.000
Food on the table.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.734
Clothes for school.

37:51.734 --> 37:54.266
Bills to pay. Diapers.

37:54.266 --> 37:58.200
Dentists. Oh. Oh.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.567
And you're all looking at me
like I'm fucking up.

38:00.567 --> 38:02.367
Which I am!

38:02.367 --> 38:03.700
Then what's the point?

38:03.700 --> 38:05.100
So you knock back a few?

38:05.100 --> 38:06.467
Then you have a few more.

38:06.467 --> 38:08.166
(horn blares)
And while you're
knocking 'em back,

38:08.166 --> 38:10.433
you know everybody's laughing,

38:10.433 --> 38:13.600
but that's okay
'cause that's what you need.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.033
Hold on! That's what you need.

38:16.033 --> 38:18.166
You need people laughing.

38:18.166 --> 38:21.600
You need people drinking
anything

38:21.600 --> 38:24.333
so long as it's not six kids

38:24.333 --> 38:26.333
that you didn't want
in the first place!

38:26.333 --> 38:29.600
So screw 'em all
and just get used to it!

38:32.133 --> 38:34.533
ALL:
♪ O Canada ♪

38:34.533 --> 38:38.166
♪ Our home and native land ♪

38:38.166 --> 38:40.100

38:40.100 --> 38:44.133

38:44.133 --> 38:46.000

38:46.000 --> 38:47.333
How you doing, Frank?

38:47.333 --> 38:50.633
Can I pour you a nice
tall, frosty Molson?

38:50.633 --> 38:52.467
Old Style, JB back.

38:52.467 --> 38:54.734
Oh, how about a Labatt
and a Canadian Club.

38:54.734 --> 38:58.233
(patrons laugh)

39:04.500 --> 39:05.367
Jesus!

39:09.300 --> 39:11.033
Ah, fine! Just kill me!

39:21.433 --> 39:23.033
EDDIE:
I don't know you, Frank,

39:23.033 --> 39:25.000
but it occurred to me,

39:25.000 --> 39:26.633
you and I are
the victims here.

39:26.633 --> 39:29.233
Two hardworking,
God-fearing men.

39:29.233 --> 39:31.066
We raised our kids
in a straight line

39:31.066 --> 39:35.433
with discipline
and with God's good guidance.

39:35.433 --> 39:39.300
My Karen was 12 when I heard her
use the C-word.

39:39.300 --> 39:40.700
And on a Sunday.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.233
Fuck.

39:42.233 --> 39:45.000
And her mother? (scoffs)

39:45.000 --> 39:48.700
A woman who's only pleasures
in life come from sex,

39:48.700 --> 39:51.000
TV cooking shows,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.700
and drawing maximum benefits
from the welfare state.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.734
Hundreds a week.

39:55.734 --> 39:56.734
And for what?

39:56.734 --> 39:59.266
Agoraphobia.
(scoffs)

39:59.266 --> 40:01.533
A made-up disease
for people who want

40:01.533 --> 40:04.467
to sit on their ass
at home and watch TV.

40:04.467 --> 40:07.266
I don't know where Sheila's
dignity's gone,

40:07.266 --> 40:10.166
or whether she ever had any
in the first place.

40:10.166 --> 40:13.300
Her whole world is
about this big,

40:13.300 --> 40:16.533
and the less she does,
the more they pay her.

40:19.266 --> 40:20.700
I've done it now.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.667
I left them.

40:23.667 --> 40:25.567
I'm not proud.

40:25.567 --> 40:27.300
Far from proud.

40:27.300 --> 40:32.700
But I just refuse to
be sorry because...

40:32.700 --> 40:36.533
(voice breaks):
because...

40:36.533 --> 40:37.700
(sniffles)

40:43.166 --> 40:45.767
I refuse to be sorry...

41:14.166 --> 41:15.500
Um...

41:15.500 --> 41:18.700
Oh, if you're looking
for the brothel,

41:18.700 --> 41:20.066
it's just two doors down.

41:20.066 --> 41:22.033
It doesn't have
a mailbox.

41:22.033 --> 41:24.433
Right-right there.
No, no, Sheila, for you.

41:24.433 --> 41:27.200
An apology.

41:28.734 --> 41:30.133
Apology?

41:30.133 --> 41:31.633
Not apology, just...

41:31.633 --> 41:33.767
I'm Frank. Ian's dad?

41:33.767 --> 41:38.133
Lip's dad?

41:38.133 --> 41:40.100
Oh! Oh, the twins?

41:40.100 --> 41:41.600
Oh.
(chuckles)
No.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.300
I... I heard about
what happened.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.433
Eddie leaving?

41:45.433 --> 41:49.033
Oh.
Uh, my boys,
your daughter?

41:49.033 --> 41:50.600
I just wanted to say

41:50.600 --> 41:52.266
I'm sorry.

41:52.266 --> 41:56.467
Oh, that's-that's-that's
very thoughtful of you.

41:56.467 --> 41:58.367
Come in, Frank.

42:04.633 --> 42:08.000
I, uh...
You'll have
to take your shoes off.

42:10.333 --> 42:13.033
This is a beautiful house,
Sheila.

42:13.033 --> 42:17.066
Oh. Thank you.

42:17.066 --> 42:18.567
It feels, uh...

42:18.567 --> 42:21.100
feels big without him.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.066
You should come over to ours.

42:23.066 --> 42:24.734
You can't move
without stepping on a kid.

42:24.734 --> 42:26.000
Six of 'em.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.400
That must be nice.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.600
It's great when they're little,

42:31.600 --> 42:34.734
but they're growing up now.
Mm-hmm.

42:34.734 --> 42:37.266
You miss them, don't you...

42:37.266 --> 42:38.333
Mm-hmm.

42:38.333 --> 42:41.367
...when they're gone
all the time?

42:41.367 --> 42:44.266
And the house
all to yourself.

42:44.266 --> 42:47.266
Don't get me wrong, I...

42:47.266 --> 42:52.033
I love time to myself, but...

42:52.033 --> 42:54.100
it's tough.

42:54.100 --> 42:56.000
(softly):
Oh.

42:56.000 --> 42:56.667
Hey...

42:56.667 --> 42:59.066
Frank.

42:59.066 --> 43:02.033
Come on, Frank.

43:02.033 --> 43:03.533
You're preaching
to the choir here.

43:03.533 --> 43:07.066
I have not been out of the house
in five years.

43:07.066 --> 43:08.600
Five years?

43:08.600 --> 43:12.734
I can't.
I have this overwhelming fear.

43:12.734 --> 43:16.367
I've got agoraphob...

43:16.367 --> 43:18.667
I'm sorry, Frank.
(sniffles)

43:18.667 --> 43:21.700
I know I'm a little nutty
about shoes, but feet!

43:21.700 --> 43:24.300
Oh, God! They have to be...!

43:24.300 --> 43:26.300
Oh, sorry, Sheila, sorry.

43:26.300 --> 43:28.033
I'll-I'll get out
of your hair. Sorry.

43:28.033 --> 43:30.567
See? This is what
I'm talking about.

43:30.567 --> 43:33.233
By the time I get a turn
in our one bathroom,

43:33.233 --> 43:35.033
there's never any
hot water!

43:35.033 --> 43:37.533
I tried to run a bath
when I got back from Canada,

43:37.533 --> 43:39.000
but no hot water!

43:39.000 --> 43:41.200
Six kids, six showers,

43:41.200 --> 43:44.233
me always at the back
of the line!

43:45.166 --> 43:47.433
We've got hot water.

43:47.433 --> 43:50.166
Hey, congratu-fuckin-lations!

43:50.166 --> 43:55.100
No, I-I meant if...

43:55.100 --> 43:56.600
if you wanted a bath.

43:58.300 --> 44:00.066
Oh.

44:09.433 --> 44:12.367
(sighs happily)

44:12.367 --> 44:14.467
(knocking on door)

44:15.433 --> 44:17.400
Fiona?

44:17.400 --> 44:19.467
No.

44:21.200 --> 44:25.033
No, she's not here, or no,
she doesn't want to see me?

44:25.033 --> 44:27.233
Both.

44:27.233 --> 44:29.367
Ah. She coming back?

44:29.367 --> 44:31.567
Nah, work. Won't be
home for hours.

44:35.700 --> 44:37.367
Looks good.

44:37.367 --> 44:40.367
Is.

44:40.367 --> 44:42.100
Did she say anything?

44:42.100 --> 44:45.467
About you?

44:45.467 --> 44:49.000
No. No, not a word.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.400
So you're saying...

44:51.400 --> 44:53.066
You fucked up
beyond the capacity

44:53.066 --> 44:54.467
of the modern human mind
to process?

44:54.467 --> 44:56.133
Yeah.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.600
Yeah,
it's a distinct possibility.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.700
Hopeless?
Hard to say.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.100
Even odds?

45:08.100 --> 45:09.266
No, less.

45:09.266 --> 45:11.467
60-40?
Much less.

45:11.467 --> 45:12.500
80-20?

45:12.500 --> 45:14.467
Maybe one in ten.

45:17.600 --> 45:21.166
Pretty colossal fuck-up.
Yeah.

45:21.166 --> 45:23.667
You're moderately clever; you'll
figure something out, right?

45:27.700 --> 45:31.667
Yep. Gotta get back.
AP Bio-Chem.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.266
Wow. That's impressive.

45:34.266 --> 45:37.000
Not really,
but if you think so...

45:37.000 --> 45:39.667
Any advice?

45:39.667 --> 45:42.600
What, to help you dive back
into my sister's cooch?

45:42.600 --> 45:43.767
Or good graces, yeah.

45:43.767 --> 45:45.166
That's the same thing, right?

45:45.166 --> 45:46.600
Hopefully.

45:47.734 --> 45:51.533
No. No, not a chance.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.433
Frank?

46:01.433 --> 46:04.033
I-I brought you some clothes.

46:04.033 --> 46:06.700
I stuck yours in the wash,
so I hope these fit.

46:07.266 --> 46:09.033
Oh.

46:09.033 --> 46:11.033
Sorry, Sheila,
I nodded off.

46:11.033 --> 46:13.433
Oh, well, you must be exhausted.

46:13.433 --> 46:16.133
Won't Eddie miss them?

46:16.133 --> 46:19.133
Not unless
he sheds 30 pounds.

46:19.133 --> 46:22.100
He found Jesus
and just packed it on.

46:23.734 --> 46:26.567
Lean, aren't you?

46:26.567 --> 46:28.533
I can go three days
without food.

46:28.533 --> 46:30.600
Oh, suits you.

46:34.300 --> 46:38.567
Well, anyway, they're...

46:38.567 --> 46:40.533
yours if you...

46:40.533 --> 46:42.200
(towel falls to floor)
Oh,

46:42.200 --> 46:43.600
Jesus...
Oh, oh.

46:54.433 --> 46:57.567
I'm sorry, it's just...

46:57.567 --> 47:01.166
something I haven't seen
in a long time, I...

47:01.166 --> 47:03.500
Eddie only just left, didn't he?

47:03.500 --> 47:05.500
I never saw Eddie's.

47:05.500 --> 47:07.467
It always had to be
pitch-black for Eddie.

47:07.467 --> 47:10.266
I saw an outline once
in a thunderstorm, but...

47:11.200 --> 47:13.333
Like a rolled-up pair of socks.

47:14.734 --> 47:20.433
You've got to be over the moon
with a fellow like yours.

47:26.700 --> 47:30.633
Oh, listen to me--
Desperate Daisy.

47:30.633 --> 47:32.200
Hey.

47:32.200 --> 47:36.600
If desperate is a crime,
then I'm a lifer, Sheila.

47:36.600 --> 47:40.166
No.
Yeah.

47:40.166 --> 47:44.467
Single parent?
You get out of the habit.

47:44.467 --> 47:46.233
You can...

47:46.233 --> 47:49.500
touch him, if you're tempted.

47:52.166 --> 47:56.233
No. No, no, I'll just,
I'll just embarrass myself.

47:56.233 --> 47:58.533
Nobody here's complaining.

48:10.533 --> 48:14.400
Oh! Uh...
okay, I can...

48:14.400 --> 48:16.400
Take your time.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.200
Come with me, Frank.

48:18.200 --> 48:19.500
Oh, hold on, Sheila, Sheila...

48:19.500 --> 48:21.400
Come on!
Hang on. Shit! Ow.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.533
Oh, you're all right.
Sheila, I can't see.

48:23.533 --> 48:26.000
Swing around, my man.
(grunting)

48:26.000 --> 48:27.300
(door closes)

48:29.166 --> 48:31.000
If I'm going
to embarrass myself,

48:31.000 --> 48:32.400
I might as well do it right.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.467
Wow, you just have the...

48:34.467 --> 48:35.767
Tight. That's tight.

48:35.767 --> 48:38.233
That is... that's very,
very tight.

48:38.233 --> 48:41.367
I'm surprised...

48:41.367 --> 48:43.433
Tribune  said Sagittarius

48:43.433 --> 48:46.266
was in a for a quiet week.

48:46.266 --> 48:48.266
Yeah, but how does this...

48:48.266 --> 48:51.133
(squeals happily)
Ah! Too tight, too tight.
Listen, um...

48:51.133 --> 48:53.100
I've changed my mind.

48:53.100 --> 48:56.233
Listen, seriously,
I-I-I don't think...

48:56.233 --> 48:57.767
It's just...

48:57.767 --> 49:00.533
That's a... what's in there?
That's a big box.

49:00.533 --> 49:03.700
Oh. That's your...
fun box?

49:03.700 --> 49:05.033
What's in there?

49:05.033 --> 49:06.166
You got...

49:06.166 --> 49:07.600
Oh, those are...
those are pretty sexy.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.033
What else is in there?

49:09.033 --> 49:11.300
Whew. I...
(laughs nervously)

49:11.300 --> 49:14.233
I'm... I'm having a bit
of a panic attack here.

49:14.233 --> 49:16.066
I... I...

49:16.066 --> 49:18.033
(coughing)

49:18.033 --> 49:19.400
No, honest,
I'm struggling to breathe.

49:19.400 --> 49:21.700
Uh...

49:21.700 --> 49:23.266
Frank.

49:23.266 --> 49:25.367
The more you beg,
the more you're in for.

49:25.367 --> 49:27.300
Now relax.

49:27.300 --> 49:30.100
I'm-I'm... I'm relaxed.

49:30.100 --> 49:31.467
I'm enjoying this.

49:31.467 --> 49:32.767
I'm fine.

49:32.767 --> 49:35.066
Let's have a, um,
a safety word.

49:35.066 --> 49:36.767
You always do that.
Shouldn't we have a safety word?

49:36.767 --> 49:39.200
Sure, all right.
Let's have a safety word.

49:39.200 --> 49:42.266
Uh, "stop." When I say stop,
that'll be our...

49:42.266 --> 49:43.700
That'll do.

49:43.700 --> 49:45.734
Okay.

49:50.734 --> 49:52.300
Oh...

49:52.300 --> 49:54.567
Look.

49:54.567 --> 49:57.400
He's smiling for me.

49:57.400 --> 49:58.467
(nervous laugh)

49:58.467 --> 50:01.066
How about that? I... okay.

50:01.066 --> 50:03.633
And when he smiles,
we all smile.

50:03.633 --> 50:05.133
Yeah.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.767
I was panicking,
I'm not going to lie to you.

50:12.767 --> 50:17.767
Just, uh, got a little...

50:17.767 --> 50:19.533
Mm-mm, stop.

50:19.533 --> 50:24.266
FRANK (screaming):
Stop...!

51:03.467 --> 51:07.667
And that is some slow-roasted
Bavarian pork chop,

51:07.667 --> 51:10.166
with bacon-braised cabbage,

51:10.166 --> 51:12.700
some warm Bavarian
potato salad,

51:12.700 --> 51:15.233
apple salsa fresca,

51:15.233 --> 51:18.667
and then, um...
just two Tylenol.

51:32.567 --> 51:35.166
MAN (on TV):
...deciphering the human
genetic code,

51:35.166 --> 51:37.500
but he's also one of
the most controversial--

51:37.500 --> 51:40.700
iconoclast with a brilliant mind
and an outsized ego

51:40.700 --> 51:44.333
who has flaunted
the conventional wisdom,

51:44.333 --> 51:48.000
and tweaked the staid scientific
establishment at every turn.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.300
(cell phone ringing)

51:49.300 --> 51:50.667
It's not me.

51:50.667 --> 51:52.567
I don't have
the phone.

51:52.567 --> 51:55.033
(phone continues ringing)
Nope.

51:55.033 --> 51:57.000
He's an adrenaline junky
whose willingness

51:57.000 --> 52:02.066
to take big risks has led to
bold scientific breakthroughs.

52:02.066 --> 52:03.333
And he's not exactly shy
about outing those achievements.
Hello?

52:03.333 --> 52:04.700
STEVE (on phone):
Hey. I'm out back.

52:04.700 --> 52:06.734
STEVE KROFT (on TV):
Where would you rank yourself

52:06.734 --> 52:09.200
in terms of scientific
accomplishment?

52:09.200 --> 52:11.233
VENTER:
Well, in the field of genomics,

52:11.233 --> 52:13.500
I think the record
is pretty clear-cut:

52:13.500 --> 52:16.600
the first genome in history, uh,

52:16.600 --> 52:18.133
the first draft
of the human genome...

52:27.200 --> 52:28.600
Hi.

52:28.600 --> 52:30.633
Hey.

52:34.066 --> 52:36.166
You stole a floral
delivery van?

52:36.166 --> 52:37.333
A peace offering.

52:37.333 --> 52:39.367
A what?

52:39.367 --> 52:41.367
A gift.

52:43.633 --> 52:45.667
What am I supposed to do
with all those roses?

52:45.667 --> 52:48.066
No, the... the van.

52:50.133 --> 52:52.233
You absolutely need something
to haul the kids around in.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.533
I'm sorry, Fiona.

52:57.533 --> 53:00.300
I shouldn't have
kidnapped your dad.

53:00.300 --> 53:02.233
It was wrong.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.667
Tri-zone air-conditioning.

53:07.667 --> 53:10.633
Power window
and door locks.

53:10.633 --> 53:12.533
Alloy wheels...

53:24.700 --> 53:26.633
Here's $80.

53:26.633 --> 53:28.467
What for?
The washer.

53:28.467 --> 53:30.500
I don't have enough to pay you
back for all of it right now.

53:30.500 --> 53:33.266
No, the washer
was a gift.
No, I'll get you
the rest as soon as I can.

53:34.233 --> 53:36.300
I don't want your money.

53:38.533 --> 53:41.066
We don't need your charity.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.467
It was a mistake.

53:44.467 --> 53:47.000
I thought I was doing you
a favor, with your dad.

53:48.266 --> 53:50.333
Go away, Steve.

54:04.266 --> 54:08.600
VENTER (on TV):
I think the teams that we have,
and what we've accomplished

54:08.600 --> 54:10.667
are certainly amongst
the biggest discoveries

54:10.667 --> 54:12.533
in modern science.
What did I miss?

54:12.533 --> 54:14.467
NARRATOR:
If you have some stereotype
of a scientist in your mind,

54:14.467 --> 54:17.500
Craig Venter probably
doesn't fit it.

54:17.500 --> 54:20.200
He scuba-dived with sharks
to gather microbes...
