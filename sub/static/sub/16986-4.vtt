00:36.745 --> 00:39.289
Kids, I'm gonna need you to be
extra nice to Mom.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.999
She had the worst hunting day possible.

00:41.083 --> 00:44.795
Oh, no. Did everyone find out
she stores food in her belly button?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.630
[gasps]
I know her shame.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.547
[Grug]
Way worse.

00:47.631 --> 00:51.885
She was trying this new surprise attack
she invented. The am-bush.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.763
I am the bush. Ha ha!

00:56.306 --> 00:57.724
- Uh...

[yelping, screaming]

01:08.443 --> 01:12.573
Uh, Ugga, is this still part
of the ambush?

01:12.656 --> 01:14.741
[Ugga screams]

01:14.825 --> 01:18.579
Ugga scream from horror
or embarrassment?

01:18.662 --> 01:19.538
[screams]

01:19.621 --> 01:24.835
Even the bear owl was embarrassed for her,
after we pried her out of its jaws.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.337
So Mom's in a real bad mood.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.007
Thunk, we need you to do
that thing you do.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.967
You mean this?
[grunts]

01:32.050 --> 01:33.635
No, the other thing.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.805
Cheering up Mom with your
Thunk-y take on life.

01:36.888 --> 01:40.851
Oh, yeah. Mom says it's what makes me
her special little cave guy.

01:40.934 --> 01:41.768
[grunts]

01:41.852 --> 01:45.397
Yeah. Stuff like that is great.
Way to be a team player, son.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.690
[Ugga shouts]

01:46.773 --> 01:48.567
Okay, you're on your own. Good luck!

01:49.526 --> 01:51.737
[growling]

01:52.529 --> 01:53.864
Hi, Mom.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.326
Hi, Thunk. Hope nobody's hungry,
'cause after my ambush mess,

01:57.409 --> 01:58.702
all we got is this.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.706
[gasps]
You mean my favorite food, meat,

02:02.789 --> 02:04.666
comes in my favorite color, blue?

02:04.750 --> 02:06.752
You're the best mom ever.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.964
Oh, that makes me feel better.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.550
[stomach rumbling]

02:14.301 --> 02:15.927
[groaning]

02:18.972 --> 02:20.557
You want some more?

02:21.642 --> 02:22.642
Mm-hmm.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.983
[laughs]
That's my special little cave...

02:36.573 --> 02:39.618
[grunts, groaning]

02:40.452 --> 02:41.536
So, Mom...
[chuckles]

02:41.620 --> 02:42.704
what's for dessert?

02:44.706 --> 02:45.832
[growls]

02:49.419 --> 02:50.712
Well, you tried, son.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.674
But I guess there are some moods that even
the Thunkiest takes on life can't change.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.051
[growls]

02:56.134 --> 02:57.677
Oh, no. I think she heard me.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.221
[Grug shrieks]

03:00.222 --> 03:03.642
I need to get back to being
Mom's special little cave guy.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.978
Hopefully, we can find a way
to cure a bad mood here

03:07.062 --> 03:10.190
in the Cave of Secrets.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.859
[gasps]
Look. I found something.

03:12.943 --> 03:18.115
"Ten ways to become the most popular
person in your pack." Ooh!

03:18.198 --> 03:19.408
Eep, focus.

03:19.491 --> 03:23.912
I am focused. "Which real predator
of Ahhh! Valley are you?"

03:23.995 --> 03:25.747
Oh, let's find out.

03:25.831 --> 03:30.794
Come on. Those quizzes are a waste
of time, and I always get wart frog.

03:30.877 --> 03:35.882
Yeah, sure, sure. Just, uh, let me leave
something in the comments section.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.343
Enough! You don't need
to share your every thought.

03:38.427 --> 03:41.096
[Eep] But I'm not done hating this yet.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.434
[Grug and Eep]
Whoa!

03:45.517 --> 03:47.894
[Eep]
"The mystery of the good surprise"?

03:47.978 --> 03:53.775
"Cavemen think all surprises are bad,
but some actually have the power

03:53.859 --> 03:57.320
to make a person happy
when nothing else will!"

03:57.404 --> 03:58.572
What? How?

03:58.655 --> 04:02.451
Doesn't say. The painter must've died
before he finished.

04:02.534 --> 04:06.747
Or he got bored.
Nope, he died.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.207
Thanks, buddy. This is just what I needed.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.419
I don't know. You heard Mom.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.629
Surprises are bad.

04:14.713 --> 04:18.675
Like getting surprised
by a predator or by quicksand.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.928
[gasps] Or by a predator
made of quicksand.

04:22.012 --> 04:26.141
You'll see, Eep. I will make
Mom happy with a good "surprise."

04:28.226 --> 04:31.480
Just as soon as we figure out
how to make a surprise good.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.941
We can't risk trying it out on Mom, so...

04:36.610 --> 04:38.278
[straining]

04:41.072 --> 04:41.907
[shouting]

04:41.990 --> 04:42.991
[both] Surprise!

04:43.074 --> 04:44.075
[shouts]

04:44.159 --> 04:45.619
[grunting]

04:45.702 --> 04:49.790
Ooh, you don't look
cheered up at all. Sorry.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.958
So, where did we go wrong?

04:52.042 --> 04:55.545
[crying]
Why?

04:55.629 --> 05:01.218
Why? You mean we need some sort of reason
for our surprise. Hmm.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.596
- Surprise!
- [shouts]

05:04.679 --> 05:07.474
Because we got you something.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.559
Really? How exciting.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.520
Yep. A ramu!

05:12.646 --> 05:13.522
[grunts]

05:13.605 --> 05:17.025
This is not exciting!
[screaming]

05:17.108 --> 05:20.529
[both] Maybe it should be a happy reason.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.283
Surprise!

05:25.367 --> 05:29.287
Good news, Munk. You
won a hundred free eggs.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.164
[gasps] I did?

05:31.248 --> 05:33.333
No. But look how happy you are now.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.295
[sobbing]

05:38.755 --> 05:43.760
Maybe it should be
a happy reason that's also true.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.055
Oh, yeah.
Pretty obvious when you think about it.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.139
[chuckles]

05:49.224 --> 05:50.600
[snoring]

05:50.684 --> 05:52.185
I think we finally got it.

05:52.269 --> 05:57.732
A happy and true reason for a surprise
that'll definitely cheer Mom up.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.360
On three. One, two...

06:00.443 --> 06:02.946
Wait. Are you sure you wanna risk this?

06:03.029 --> 06:05.782
Maybe Mom's already over
the whole ambush mess.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.367
- [all snoring]
- [Ugga] Stupid ambush.

06:07.450 --> 06:12.747
And in front of the hunters.
[groans] Stupid, stupid, stupid.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.457
[snoring]

06:15.417 --> 06:16.293
[shouts]

06:16.376 --> 06:20.839
Nah, scratch that.
Where were we? Right. Three.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.049
- Surprise!
- What's wrong?

06:23.133 --> 06:25.135
Who fell into a thing?
How sharp are its teeth?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.678
Everything's fine, Mom.

06:26.761 --> 06:32.309
I'm just bringing you a new surprise
we call breakfast in a sleep pile.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.144
Ta-da!

06:34.227 --> 06:37.230
Here you go. [straining]

06:37.314 --> 06:38.857
I mean...

06:38.940 --> 06:41.192
[straining]
here you go.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.819
[grunts, sighs]

06:42.902 --> 06:46.615
Wow! This is sorta sweet.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.658
You know what's weird?

06:48.742 --> 06:52.329
This surprise actually
makes me feel happy!

06:52.412 --> 06:55.248
[screaming]

06:55.332 --> 06:57.250
Uh, I think I really messed up.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.714
Don't worry, Mom. It's just a baby.
It can't fly very far off the ground.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.091
[grunting]

07:08.261 --> 07:09.721
- [grunting]
- [screams]

07:10.472 --> 07:11.848
Mom!

07:11.932 --> 07:13.808
[gasps]
Are you all right?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.519
Ugga, this not your day.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.814
[roars]

07:20.982 --> 07:26.363
Uh, any chance that "grrr" means
"I'm great, special little cave guy"?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.281
[snarling]

07:32.202 --> 07:33.620
[sighs]

07:35.246 --> 07:37.666

07:39.250 --> 07:40.877
[grunts]

07:41.294 --> 07:43.755
[continues grunting]
Man!

07:44.214 --> 07:45.048
[groans]

07:45.131 --> 07:46.716
Why?

07:46.800 --> 07:51.012
Oh, you wanna go, huh?
I eat bigger rocks than you for breakfast.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.849
Mom, come quick!
Thunk has gone to the hunting fields.

07:54.933 --> 07:58.812
He says he's gonna prove to everyone
that your ambush works.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.315
He what?
Looks like it's your lucky day.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.653
Thunk! Thunk! Oh, no.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.864
[roaring]
I am the bush!

08:09.948 --> 08:11.491
[yelps]

08:11.574 --> 08:13.243
Thunk, we've gotta get outta here.

08:13.326 --> 08:18.123
No. I'm gonna cheer you up by ambushing
those bear owls, and possibly surviving.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.582
But that's crazy.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.377
No, it's not, because
if I can't make you happy,

08:22.460 --> 08:24.879
then I'm not your little
special cave guy anymore.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.256
- What?
- [snarling]

08:27.966 --> 08:30.677
Hey, knock it off. We're having
a touching moment here.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.889
Thunk, sweetie,
people get upset sometimes,

08:34.972 --> 08:38.018
but I promise,
no matter what mood I am in,

08:38.101 --> 08:41.645
you'll always be
my special little cave guy.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.981
Really?

08:43.982 --> 08:44.858
This way!

08:44.941 --> 08:46.901
No. This way.
Toward that cave.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.987
[screams]

08:49.070 --> 08:50.405
[panting]

08:50.822 --> 08:52.991
I know I'm slow, but you're not.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.704
[screaming, shouting]

08:59.497 --> 09:01.041
[rumbling]

09:05.920 --> 09:07.380
Quick. Clear the rocks.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.758
[grunting]

09:12.635 --> 09:16.765
Mom, if this is our last moment,
then there's something I should say.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.391
What is it, honey?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.642
Well, just that...

09:23.813 --> 09:26.983
This is twice now
that your ambush idea has failed.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.360
Pretty embarrassing, huh?

09:29.444 --> 09:30.904
[screams]

09:33.531 --> 09:36.201
Who's next?
Come to Mama.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.702
[shouts]

09:41.331 --> 09:44.959
Wow! Thunk, that was a bold move,

09:45.043 --> 09:47.587
putting me in a bad mood like that.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.839
[chuckles]
Easy choice, Mom.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.009
After all, I know your mood
doesn't change how you feel about me.

09:53.093 --> 09:58.473
Oh, that's right.
I will love you in any mood.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.892
But we're all done with
these awful surprises, right?

10:00.975 --> 10:03.061
Surprise!

10:03.144 --> 10:09.567
<i>♪ For she's a bloodthirsty cavewoman

10:14.322 --> 10:18.118

10:19.369 --> 10:21.955
What? Who is? What is all this?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.457
It's a surprise party, Mom.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.917
It was Thunk's idea.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.420
We've all come to tell you how much
we love and respect you, honey.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.381
Not me. I came for the food.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.927
Ugga son tell Amber
Ugga feel embarrassed.

10:36.010 --> 10:41.015
But Ugga not need feel that way.
Hunters think Ugga ruthless killer.

10:41.099 --> 10:47.063
Oh, wow! That was the exact thing
I needed to hear you say.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.400
Yeah. Amber good smart with words.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.529
So all that stuff outside was just a trick
to get me here?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.489
Yep. And those bear owls...

10:56.573 --> 10:59.492
that was just Munk
and the hunters in costumes.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.578
Huh? We're supposed to do what now?

11:01.661 --> 11:02.871
[gulps]

11:02.954 --> 11:06.708
Or they were real bear owls
and we almost died.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.793
[chuckles]
Surprise.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.255
I am surprised. In a good way.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.884
Thank you, my special little cave guy.

[music playing]

11:41.367 --> 11:44.120
Class, for today's lesson...

11:44.203 --> 11:46.998
I got nothing. So, any ideas?

11:47.081 --> 11:48.625
Let's talk about Night Mares.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.460
- Yeah!
- [all cheering]

11:50.543 --> 11:53.755
Ooh, good choice.
[chuckles]

11:53.838 --> 11:55.214
Maybe you should be the teacher.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.425
- Really?
- No.

11:57.508 --> 12:01.220
Back to Night Mares.
Night Mares are the best.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.932
Pretty rainbow horses
that only come out at night.

12:04.015 --> 12:07.143
[giggles]
We all love them.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.064
But who can tell me
how to catch a Night Mare, hmm?

12:11.147 --> 12:13.483
[laughs]
Nice try, Teacher Squawk,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.401
but you can't catch a Night Mare.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.863
Yeah, because their wild hearts
deserve to run free.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.074
No. Because they don't exist.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.242
[laughs]

12:26.412 --> 12:30.041
Oh, don't mind us, little girl
who's making a fool of herself.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.710
Yeah, Eep. Night Mares totally exist.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.045
I saw one once.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.215
<i>His smile was so bright...</i>

12:37.298 --> 12:39.092
- [gasp]
- <i>I had to look away.</i>

12:39.175 --> 12:40.802
[whinnies]

12:40.885 --> 12:42.220
[Pat]
<i>I saw him, too.</i>

12:42.303 --> 12:46.724
<i>His smell's so sweet that all other
smells are, like, ruined forever.</i>

12:46.808 --> 12:47.808
[retching]

12:48.559 --> 12:50.228
[neighing]

12:50.311 --> 12:52.563
[Lerk]
<i>When I looked into his eyes, I saw</i>

12:52.647 --> 12:54.774
<i>all the secrets of life.</i>

12:58.236 --> 13:00.321
You're a cartoon!

13:01.406 --> 13:06.577
Okay, show of hands.
Who has seen a Night Mare?

13:06.661 --> 13:10.373
- Just so I know who here is cool.
- [excited chatter]

13:12.500 --> 13:16.754
Me! Yeah, yeah, I was just messin', guys.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.132
I see Night Mares all the time.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.384
Really? Prove it.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.304
You know, I'll prove it by... by...

13:25.388 --> 13:28.599
bringing you a tuft of its mane.

13:28.683 --> 13:33.479
Yep, which I totally have
back at my cave.

13:33.563 --> 13:39.193
Yep...
From when I saw it, so, yeah.

13:40.278 --> 13:44.282
Sure. Otherwise it would be very
humiliating for you.

13:44.365 --> 13:48.661
Why, we might have to laugh
at you forever.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.914
[cackling]

13:54.959 --> 13:57.545
[all laughing]

13:57.628 --> 13:59.255
[chuckles]

14:00.465 --> 14:02.300
[Ugga]
No staying up all night, Eep.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.760
You need your beauty sleep,

14:03.843 --> 14:06.137
to sleep off your beauty and look tough.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.431
But, Mom, I've worked it all out.

14:08.514 --> 14:13.686
Okay, first, I stay up until
I attract a Night Mare with spike apples.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.815
Then I cut off a tuft of its rainbow mane.

14:17.899 --> 14:21.527
Then I take it to school,
wowing my classmates forever.

14:21.611 --> 14:25.281
And then, I give Thunk an award
for best brother in the valley?

14:25.365 --> 14:28.117
Thunk, stop messing with my plans!

14:28.201 --> 14:29.285
Eh, worth a shot.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.580
No, Eep. Staying up will give you
the night crazies.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.874
[sighs] Remember
when it happened to Thunk?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.001
So I tried to eat a bunch of toenails.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.463
On Mom's foot.
I thought they were berries.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.382
Exactly. Now good night.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.969
[groans]
Pig rats.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.554
[snores]

14:50.223 --> 14:51.307
Mom,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.434
if you've changed your mind

14:53.518 --> 14:56.145
and you're all right
with me staying up now,

14:56.229 --> 14:59.732
just say...
[snores]

15:00.775 --> 15:02.985
[snores]

15:03.069 --> 15:04.695
[chuckles]

15:08.699 --> 15:09.699
[snickers]

15:13.079 --> 15:17.458
All right! These eyes won't shut
till they see the Night Mare,

15:17.542 --> 15:20.920
and I got everything I need to stay awake.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.339
Yeah. Jumping beans.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.052
And jumping beans.
[chuckles]

15:29.262 --> 15:31.889
[laughs]
Oh, yeah!

15:31.973 --> 15:35.852
[chanting] I'm gonna catch a Night Mare,
gonna pull out its night hair!

15:36.811 --> 15:39.480
I'm gonna catch a Night Mare,

15:39.564 --> 15:44.152
[sighs] gonna pull out its night hair.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.778
[yawning]

15:45.862 --> 15:48.531
Mm, on second thought...

15:48.614 --> 15:50.867
[sighs]

15:50.950 --> 15:51.868
[shouts]

15:51.951 --> 15:53.286
[grunts]
Okay.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.497
[grunts, babbles]
No sleeping!

15:56.581 --> 16:00.251
[sighs] I need something else
to keep me awake. Yeah.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.920
Or maybe someone else.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.759
- [snoring]
- Rise and shine, Thunk.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.096
Snuggle parade!

16:13.181 --> 16:14.390
I mean, no.

16:14.474 --> 16:19.479
I was not dreaming about leading a parade
of fuzzy, snuggly cuddle monsters.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.981
They were leading me.
[chuckles]

16:22.064 --> 16:25.610
[chuckles] Right. Listen, I need you
to help me stay awake

16:25.693 --> 16:28.237
so I can see the Night Mare tonight.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.364
[sighs] I don't know, Eep.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.326
What if you get the night crazies?
It's too risky.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.329
[sighs] That's too bad.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.999
Because I really wanted to hear
a thrilling story

16:40.082 --> 16:42.668
filled with magic and intrigue.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.921
[gasps, laughs]
I have just the tale.

16:45.004 --> 16:49.342
It's called
"The Intriguingly Magical Pugott."

16:49.425 --> 16:52.011
Once upon a time, there was a pugott

16:52.094 --> 16:56.349
with three heads, and he was so lonely,

16:56.432 --> 17:00.019
'cause all the other pugotts didn't
wanna eat all the spinach that he...

17:00.102 --> 17:02.480
So there he was,
hanging off a cliff when...

17:02.563 --> 17:04.440
- [gasps]
- the mean bear owl

17:04.523 --> 17:09.444
held out his hand to the good bear owl
and said, "I am your father."

17:09.529 --> 17:12.031
And then the pugott
sprouted wings and he...

17:12.114 --> 17:16.953
Thunk, the spike apples are gone!
The Night Mare must have been here.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.789
- [gasps]
- We know you're out here, Night Mare.

17:20.665 --> 17:27.380
Oh. Oh, well. Hm-hm.
Looks like he got far, far away.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.423
A-ha! Weird.

17:29.507 --> 17:33.761
I thought he was standing behind me.
Hm, guess I was wrong.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.013
A-ha! Hmm,

17:36.097 --> 17:38.391
I'm starting to feel pretty stupid here.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.184
[chuckles]
A-ha!

17:40.268 --> 17:42.395
- [groans]
- [Thunk] Eep! I see it.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.646
You do? Where?

17:43.729 --> 17:46.274
Right there.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.860
[gasps] He's glorious.
Here, mare-y, mare-y.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.363
Uh, Thunk, that's me.

17:52.446 --> 17:55.157
Stop goofing around
and help me find it.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.701
Neigh, neigh.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.494
Sure thing, night-y.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.206
Just as soon as I get
a tuft of your mane for Eep.

18:02.290 --> 18:07.336
Oh, no. You have the night crazies.
Thunk, snap out of it!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.714
Would someone
with night crazies do this?

18:09.797 --> 18:12.592
- [shouting]
- [screams]

18:13.134 --> 18:15.511
[giggling hysterically]

18:15.595 --> 18:16.596
Stop!

18:16.679 --> 18:18.014
[yawns]

18:18.097 --> 18:20.516
So tired.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.311
[laughing continues]

18:24.395 --> 18:25.688
[laughs]

18:28.941 --> 18:30.568
[Eep]
No, no, no, don't do it!

18:31.569 --> 18:33.696
Because you're in our way.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.364
You make a cute couple, though.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.952
[yelling]

18:41.954 --> 18:44.040

- [screams]
- [screams]

18:48.002 --> 18:50.588
[panting]
Thunk, are you okay?

18:50.671 --> 18:54.634
The Night Mare, he was just here.
Did you see where he pranced off to?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.510
No, that was me.

18:56.594 --> 19:01.557
You got the night crazies and got all...
well, crazy at night.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.393
I did? Oh, how embarrassing.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.896
[sneezes]

19:09.899 --> 19:12.943
Oh. It's almost morning.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.195
[sighs]

19:14.278 --> 19:16.113
I'm never gonna see
the Night Mare.

19:16.197 --> 19:21.619
And everyone's gonna laugh at me forever.
Or I could drop out of school.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.664
Don't give up, Eep.
See it for both of us.

19:24.747 --> 19:28.042
[yawns]

19:29.168 --> 19:31.379
[snoring]

19:31.462 --> 19:33.297

19:33.381 --> 19:35.049
No!

19:35.132 --> 19:37.468
[shouts]
No, I won't.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.638
[yawns]
No...

- [neighing]

19:41.972 --> 19:42.972
[gasps]

19:46.977 --> 19:48.896
Night Mare.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.316
Hi.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.484
[giggles]

19:53.567 --> 19:57.196
Hi. Are you a Night Mare?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.281
[chuckles]
Of course you are.

19:59.990 --> 20:04.328
You're so pretty.
Or do you prefer handsome?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.374
Oh, you're blowing it, Eep.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.918
I'll, uh, I'll just cut to the chase.

20:11.001 --> 20:14.296
Any chance I could get one
tiny tasteful tuft of your mane?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.380
Please.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.051
Well, since you said please.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.219
[gasps]

20:20.302 --> 20:21.387
You can talk?

20:21.470 --> 20:22.513
[clears throat]

20:22.596 --> 20:23.764
Not only that...

20:23.848 --> 20:25.808

20:25.891 --> 20:29.061

But I don't like to brag.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.480
Whoa!
[laughs]

20:31.564 --> 20:35.860
This is incredible! I wish everyone
at school could see me right now.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.236
You got it.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.656
[gasps, laughing]

20:41.907 --> 20:43.659
Students, the right way to fall...

20:43.743 --> 20:45.077
is not this way!

20:45.161 --> 20:48.831
See? I met a Night Mare.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.000
We're so sorry we doubted you.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.168
Forgive us.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.085
Yeah.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.921
Like, I've never ever said I'm sorry,

20:56.005 --> 20:59.800
but for you, I'm thinking it.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.678
[chuckles]
Oh, thank you so much.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.890
[sighs] I think everyone
should have a Night Mare.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.268
Then why don't we give
everyone a Night Mare?

21:17.485 --> 21:18.861

21:21.864 --> 21:23.741

Nothing!

21:27.286 --> 21:30.498
Wait. Am I dreaming?

21:30.581 --> 21:31.832
[chuckles]
No.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.209
Just night crazy.

So, how was your night crazies?

21:42.593 --> 21:44.470
Enjoy eating my toenails?

21:45.346 --> 21:48.599
[sighs] I should've known
that it was too good to be true.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.185
I guess I have to go to school
and face the fact

21:51.268 --> 21:53.479
that I'm the only one
who hasn't seen a...

21:53.562 --> 21:54.688

21:57.066 --> 21:58.609

You can't outrun me.
Ooh, free meatballs.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.954
Wait. Lerk just has
the night crazies, too?

22:10.037 --> 22:12.998
Huh, maybe nobody saw the Night Mare.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.875
I knew I was right.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.045
Of course there's
no such thing as a horse.

22:18.128 --> 22:21.048
Yeah. A lion horse? Sure.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.634
But just a horse?
That's the stuff of dreams.
