EPISODE 8
FRONT MAN

02:08.002 --> 02:09.254
Why'd you do that?

02:11.422 --> 02:13.091
What the hell did you expect, huh?

02:13.174 --> 02:14.884
Why go up and push that guy?

02:16.719 --> 02:18.805
You got lucky waiting
in the back of the line.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.266
Must have forgotten how things are here.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.895
What if that guy ended up wasting our time
on that one step like that criminal?

02:26.771 --> 02:28.022
Would you have done nothing?

02:28.106 --> 02:29.524
But he was on the last tile.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.652
He would move to the next one soon.

02:32.735 --> 02:33.862
How can you know that, huh?

02:35.029 --> 02:37.991
That last guy could tell
the tempered glass apart the whole time,

02:38.074 --> 02:40.535
but he watched all
those poor bastards out there die.

02:41.035 --> 02:44.789
The only reason you and I even made it
is 'cause he could tell the tiles apart.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.292
Come on! Just stop it with this bullshit.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.502
That guy is not the reason
that I'm still here, okay?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.462
I'll tell you the reason.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.841
It's that I'm willing to do
almost anything to win this.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.718
Stop with the excuses. I'm not buying it.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.470
You still killed someone.
His bullet is in your hands.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.680
Get it together, huh.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.934
We'll be killing everyone
if we want that money.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.270
Think about it for just one second.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.858
You should be happy that there's someone
who's not afraid to get his hands dirty.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.862
And if it were me on that tile?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.740
Come on!

03:19.616 --> 03:20.617
Gi-hun!

03:23.620 --> 03:25.830
Your life is so damn pathetic,
and here's why.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.543
It's because you always gotta open
your mouth and ask something idiotic.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.380
Because you're a nosy-ass idiot
who's too slow to keep it shut.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.843
Someone who always has to get into trouble
but somehow can't tell he's in it.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.430
Okay.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.309
That's right.
That's how I got caught in all this.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.439
Because I was slow, crazy incompetent.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.193
Just a dimwit who lives off his mother,
but you're with me in this place.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.444
Isn't that interesting?

03:58.780 --> 03:59.739
Why is that?

04:00.865 --> 04:03.284
Ssangmun-dong's golden child,
the genius Cho Sang-woo,

04:03.368 --> 04:04.661
who went to SNU was here?

04:05.453 --> 04:07.080
Rolling around this shithole,

04:07.580 --> 04:09.415
slamming with us, simpletons, huh!

04:11.417 --> 04:13.169
Is it my fault that you're here?

04:26.766 --> 04:29.852
Players, we sincerely
congratulate and commend you all

04:29.936 --> 04:32.772
for successfully making it
through the first five games.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.568
The three of you are now the finalists

04:37.652 --> 04:41.406
and as such, we have prepared
a special gift for each of you.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.200
Before we reveal the gift,

04:44.284 --> 04:47.787
please take a moment to change
into the outfits we have brought.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.307
Bring him to me alive.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.949
JUNE 29, MONDAY

06:49.742 --> 06:51.452
CHIEF

06:54.789 --> 06:56.207
-Jun-ho!
-It's me, Chief.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.292
-Where the hell are you?
-Can you hear me all right, sir?

06:58.376 --> 07:01.212
-I haven't seen or heard from you in days!
-Just hold on, I'll explain it later.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.089
-Who the hell do you think you are?
-Look, I'm somewhere southwest

07:03.172 --> 07:04.257
-of the mainland.
-What?

07:04.340 --> 07:05.633
Can you try to locate my signal?

07:05.716 --> 07:07.218
-Put a whole team together for this.
-What?

07:07.301 --> 07:08.928
-A whole team?
-I need backup.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.556
You gotta get a whole squad.
The police, coast guard, everyone.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.266
What did you say?
I can't hear you!

07:13.349 --> 07:15.601
Let me send over a couple of things, okay,
and take a look.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.270
-Slow it down--
-I'll call you again soon.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.354
What did you do…

08:52.990 --> 08:56.702
Tonight's feast
is prepared as a token of gratitude

08:56.786 --> 08:59.664
for the sacrifice and effort
that you finalists have made,

08:59.747 --> 09:05.294
and to encourage you all to perform
even more splendidly in the final game.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.130
Now please relax and enjoy your feast.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.837
RE-SEND

09:55.636 --> 09:56.887
He's over there.

10:19.952 --> 10:20.995
Ah.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.006
Police. Put down your weapons,
you got that?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.761
We already know everything about you all.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.721
The coast guard will be here soon.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.516
I don't know.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.811
Have the Korean police
ever been quick to act?

11:27.812 --> 11:31.565
And besides, you barely get
any signal around here.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.068
I don't know what you tried to send,

11:34.694 --> 11:36.362
but I doubt it went through.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.782
Come and turn yourself in.
You'll get a plea bargain with that.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.952
If you drop your gun right now
and hand over the phone,

11:43.577 --> 11:45.204
I might let you live.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.997
Stop right there.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.627
That gun of yours holds five bullets.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.005
But for police regulations,

11:55.089 --> 11:59.218
one chamber must remain empty,
and one must be filled with a blank.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.179
That leaves three live rounds.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.807
You've already used one to kill a man

12:05.599 --> 12:07.601
and another one to break the lock.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.941
Which means that there's only
one bullet left in your gun.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.693
One bullet is more than enough
to kill you.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.704
Give up.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.292
I warned you.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.335
Take another step and…

14:06.470 --> 14:07.972
This is over.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.850
Now come with me.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.439
Do as I say.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.067
Or you die.

14:30.828 --> 14:31.996
Who the hell…

14:32.788 --> 14:33.789
are you?

14:53.642 --> 14:54.852
In-ho.

14:56.812 --> 14:57.897
Let's go.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.860
Make this easy.

15:25.674 --> 15:26.717
Brother…

15:28.636 --> 15:29.803
In-ho, why?

17:07.401 --> 17:08.402
Sae-byeok.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.407
It's all right.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.201
I didn't come here to kill you.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.121
You've been dozing off.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.040
I'd have killed you already
if I wanted to.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.590
I have this with me
because of Sang-woo there.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.594
Protection, you know.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.914
You're not holding up too well, huh?

18:03.749 --> 18:06.126
No, it's okay. I feel fine.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.296
So how come you barely touched
your food earlier?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.592
It wasn't very well cooked, that's all.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.431
Stop lying, please.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.810
And if I'm hurt?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.438
Are you gonna try to treat it?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.236
You need to think about yourself.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.447
Just leave me. I'll be okay.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.119
Hey, Kang Sae-byeok.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.622
We should stick together.

18:44.832 --> 18:45.916
We can beat him.

18:46.875 --> 18:47.960
Whatever the game,

18:48.919 --> 18:51.213
we'll help each other get through this
as teammates.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.596
Show that psychopath what we can do.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.149
Share all that prize money
and just run away.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.704
And do you know what you're gonna do
with all that money once we get out?

19:24.413 --> 19:26.081
I'd pay my debt off first.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.838
And buy a nice clean store
in the city for my mom.

19:36.216 --> 19:40.262
She always hoped to run a, a real store,
not just the kind of little stall.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.806
And I would…

19:47.060 --> 19:49.271
finally start being a dad to my girl…

19:53.567 --> 19:55.319
for once in my life.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.362
How old is your daughter?

19:58.113 --> 19:59.239
She's ten.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.660
That's also how old my little brother is.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.541
And where is your brother staying now?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.627
In orphanage.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.383
I promised that
he'd get out of there soon.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.346
Our mother is stuck in the North
right now.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.894
I said I'd get her once I was able
to make enough money,

20:28.977 --> 20:30.520
and I'll get us all a house.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.275
There's so much in there. I think
even with half, you'll have plenty.

20:39.821 --> 20:40.906
Hey, Gi-hun.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.871
I think you and I should make a deal.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.128
What kind of deal?

20:59.424 --> 21:01.218
Just in case either of us…

21:03.053 --> 21:05.639
can actually make it out
of this hellhole somehow,

21:07.182 --> 21:09.601
we'll look after
each other's loved ones, okay?

21:13.772 --> 21:15.190
Don't say that. Come on.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.613
We'll beat Sang-woo,
and then, we'll get out of here together.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.787
I still want you to swear, though.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.754
I need you to swear
that you'll look after him.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.383
Shh.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.548
Don't do it.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.886
That isn't you.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.472
You're a good person at heart.

22:48.992 --> 22:49.910
Hey.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.745
Hey, what's wrong?

22:51.828 --> 22:53.955
Hey, you're… you're…

22:54.581 --> 22:55.457
You're…

22:56.458 --> 22:57.751
What happened? When?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.212
When did you get hurt?

23:00.754 --> 23:01.713
Shit.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.175
-Mister.
-Huh?

23:06.134 --> 23:09.096
I think I wanna go.
I'd like to go home now.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.892
Hey, hold on, Sae-byeok. Stay here.

23:14.851 --> 23:17.229
Don't let yourself go.
Just keep on holding this.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.231
I'll go get someone, okay?

23:25.695 --> 23:27.280
Hey, hey! We need help.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.865
She's lost a lot of blood!

23:28.949 --> 23:30.367
Somebody get in here!

23:30.450 --> 23:31.993
There's a badly injured girl!

23:32.786 --> 23:34.246
Is anybody out there?

23:35.956 --> 23:38.041
Get in here, you assholes!

23:38.125 --> 23:39.835
Someone's dying! Hello?

23:40.335 --> 23:41.211
Send help in!

23:41.294 --> 23:43.547
You need her alive
if you want her in the next round!

23:44.214 --> 23:46.425
Somebody out there, please, answer me!

23:53.890 --> 23:55.308
Oh. Hey!

23:55.934 --> 23:58.687
Could you please get a doctor?
She's lost a lot of blood.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.397
Hurry! Please.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.149
She's…

24:33.930 --> 24:34.890
Sae-byeok.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.189
Sae… Sae-byeok.

24:42.939 --> 24:43.982
Sae-byeok.

24:44.691 --> 24:45.734
No.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.362
Oh, no. Oh, Sae-byeok.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.281
Oh, no. Sae-byeok, no.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.026
Jun-ho…

27:03.330 --> 27:04.581
In-ho, why?
