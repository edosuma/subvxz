01:54.787 --> 01:56.955
Do you feel it, Casey?

01:56.957 --> 01:58.857
- The darkness?
- Just stop!

01:58.859 --> 02:00.291
I feel it.

02:00.293 --> 02:01.559
Consuming me.

02:01.561 --> 02:03.729
And do you know
what it's saying?

02:03.731 --> 02:06.365
It's saying to spill

02:21.281 --> 02:22.713
I told you.

02:22.715 --> 02:24.751
Colin's dead.

03:21.107 --> 03:23.977
(growling)

03:50.436 --> 03:51.969
All right,
we got a rotation change.

03:51.971 --> 03:54.004
You got post one,
you got post two.

03:54.006 --> 03:55.873
All right,
let's get off.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.641
What the hell is it, boss?
What are we doing?

03:57.643 --> 03:59.613
Come here...
ugh, now this.

04:01.381 --> 04:03.915
Dr. Shaw requested
that Patient 3178

04:03.917 --> 04:05.649
be transferred
to isolation

04:05.651 --> 04:08.820
until the meeting and tour
of the facility is completed.

04:08.822 --> 04:10.855
You think your men
can handle that?

04:10.857 --> 04:12.623
Oh, yes, ma'am, Paula.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.458
Then I'll leave you to it.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.428
Fuckin' bitch.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.829
Oh, I'm nervous, man.

04:18.832 --> 04:20.498
- What of?
- I've heard a lot about

04:20.500 --> 04:22.400
this, uh, 3178.

04:22.402 --> 04:24.001
What's the deal there?

04:24.003 --> 04:25.404
Well, now,
you're gonna find out.

04:25.406 --> 04:27.005
Just don't, uh,
wet your pants

04:27.007 --> 04:28.005
when we get in there,
all right?

04:28.007 --> 04:29.808
I think I'm good.

04:29.810 --> 04:31.842
I'd like to be the meat
in that nurse sandwich.

04:31.844 --> 04:33.645
Oh, uh-huh.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.382
You're something,
Lehman.

04:37.517 --> 04:39.049
- Officer...
- Keys?

04:39.051 --> 04:40.685
- Tate, doors.
- Yeah.

04:40.687 --> 04:42.357
Fuckin' noob.

04:43.757 --> 04:46.427
Today, Tate.

04:48.428 --> 04:49.861
All right,
freak, let's go.

04:49.863 --> 04:52.197
(clapping hands)

04:52.199 --> 04:54.532
What's with the mask?

04:54.534 --> 04:57.635
This one here...
he actually prefers a mask.

04:57.637 --> 04:59.637
And it makes him
behave better.

04:59.639 --> 05:00.972
(locks clunk)

05:00.974 --> 05:02.507
All right,
let's get up.

05:02.509 --> 05:03.875
Come on.

05:03.877 --> 05:06.178
All right, fellas,
let's get the weird one here

05:06.180 --> 05:07.849
over to isolation.

05:15.955 --> 05:19.426
Hey, eyes-up, team,
no mistakes tonight.

05:37.911 --> 05:40.145
Gentlemen, I apologize
for being late.

05:40.147 --> 05:42.046
I'm Sybil Shaw,
I'm the director

05:42.048 --> 05:43.714
of the Athens Institute.

05:43.716 --> 05:45.584
Dr. Shaw,
Arthur Haywood.

05:45.586 --> 05:47.486
This is my associate,
Julian York.

05:47.488 --> 05:50.121
Hi... impressive facility.

05:50.123 --> 05:52.590
Thank you...
follow me, gentlemen.

05:52.592 --> 05:54.558
Let's get started.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.926
You certainly have
a lot of secrecy

05:55.928 --> 05:57.828
surrounding your
institute, Doctor,

05:57.830 --> 06:00.832
but, uh, I suppose
that's prudent.

06:00.834 --> 06:02.801
You know, some people
have labeled you a...

06:02.803 --> 06:05.036
collector
of these crazies.

06:05.038 --> 06:08.673
They say that you purposely
seek out only the boogeymen,

06:08.675 --> 06:11.710
for lack of
a better term.

06:11.712 --> 06:13.678
At Athens,
we currently house

06:13.680 --> 06:18.116
150 of the world's
most violent psychopaths.

06:18.118 --> 06:20.719
We're not talking
about your average,

06:20.721 --> 06:22.921
everyday
bad guys here.

06:22.923 --> 06:24.722
We're talking about
those whose crimes

06:24.724 --> 06:27.993
have plagued humanity
for decades.

06:27.995 --> 06:32.029
At Athens, we only house
the worst of the worst.

06:32.031 --> 06:33.633
Security?

06:35.034 --> 06:36.635
Here at Athens,

06:36.637 --> 06:38.803
we operate
under what we refer to

06:38.805 --> 06:41.005
as a constant
red state.

06:41.007 --> 06:44.142
If one of those
criminals should,

06:44.144 --> 06:46.911
by some miracle,
manage to escape,

06:46.913 --> 06:49.813
the guards are
under strict orders.

06:49.815 --> 06:51.084
Shoot to kill.

06:54.587 --> 06:55.822
Officer.

07:04.798 --> 07:06.798
Is this Silas Crane?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.265
Yes, sir.

07:08.267 --> 07:10.801
Mr. Crane's sick
obsession with clowns

07:10.803 --> 07:12.871
led him to butcher
several boys

07:12.873 --> 07:16.074
while he was traveling
with the circus.

07:31.692 --> 07:35.060
Whoa!
What the... hell?

07:35.062 --> 07:36.661
That's Martin.

07:36.663 --> 07:38.096
Or, as he's known
around here,

07:38.098 --> 07:39.897
Masturbating Martin.

07:39.899 --> 07:41.633
He liked to hang
around playgrounds

07:41.635 --> 07:43.335
and kidnap
young children.

07:43.337 --> 07:46.904
They discovered
13 bodies in his attic.

07:46.906 --> 07:48.272
(Martin gasping)

07:48.274 --> 07:49.774
Sick.

07:49.776 --> 07:52.913
(Martin gasping)

07:58.284 --> 08:01.019
Oh, hey,
I know this guy.

08:01.021 --> 08:03.887
Uh... Babyface,
they called him.

08:03.889 --> 08:05.255
Wilson Parish.

this is Angel.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.912
Angel Cross.

08:28.914 --> 08:30.948
She's our modern-day
Bonnie Parker.

08:30.950 --> 08:33.018
She and her boyfriend

08:33.020 --> 08:34.351
cut a bloody swath

08:34.352 --> 08:35.852
through
the United States

08:35.855 --> 08:37.822
until he was killed.

08:37.823 --> 08:39.991
That's when she came
to be with me.

08:39.993 --> 08:42.863
(chuckling)

08:51.805 --> 08:54.438
Wait, why does this room
have a window,

08:54.440 --> 08:57.007
and why is it empty?

08:57.009 --> 09:00.010
That would be
Patient 3178.

09:00.012 --> 09:02.279
He was moved earlier
to isolation.

09:02.281 --> 09:04.082
For insurance purposes.

09:04.084 --> 09:05.183
Follow me, gentlemen,

09:05.185 --> 09:07.184
my office is
right down the hall.

09:07.186 --> 09:08.886
Morbid artwork.

09:08.888 --> 09:10.056
Mm-hmm.

09:12.191 --> 09:13.692
You know,
them bitches last night

09:13.694 --> 09:15.959
at the Pretty Panda
were off the hook.

09:15.961 --> 09:18.263
At one point, I had four
busty titties in my face.

09:18.265 --> 09:20.198
I was like...
(sputtering)

09:20.200 --> 09:21.799
That place is gross, dude.

09:21.801 --> 09:23.768
They should've named it
the Slut Bucket

09:23.770 --> 09:25.703
for all that disgusting
roast beef vagina

09:25.705 --> 09:27.005
on the whores
that work there.

09:27.007 --> 09:28.939
I snuck a lick
of a nipple,

09:28.941 --> 09:30.442
and it was the size
of my pinkie, man.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.242
Okay, that's it.

09:32.244 --> 09:33.912
I can't do that anymore.

09:33.914 --> 09:36.747
I am so tired of hearing
about roast beef pussy

09:36.749 --> 09:38.449
and long-ass
titty nipples.

09:38.451 --> 09:39.884
You know, like that,
that's...

09:39.886 --> 09:41.251
You don't know what
you're missing, man.

09:41.253 --> 09:43.053
Uh-huh... I'll tell you what.

09:43.055 --> 09:44.923
When I want warts
all over my pecker,

09:44.925 --> 09:46.457
I'll go down
to the Shitty Titty myself.

09:46.459 --> 09:48.793
A-fuckin'-men.

09:48.795 --> 09:51.361
All right,
I gotta go take a pisser.

09:51.363 --> 09:53.932
And... try not
to fuck things up too bad

09:53.934 --> 09:55.733
- while I'm gone, okay?
- Okay, got it.

09:55.735 --> 09:57.268
Shake three times,
you're playing with yourself.

09:57.270 --> 09:58.736
Yeah, yeah,
yeah-yeah-yeah.

09:58.738 --> 10:00.739
- So, hey, Tate...
- Mmm?

10:00.741 --> 10:03.276
For 50 bucks, I'll let you
fuck one of those crazies.

10:05.078 --> 10:06.910
- Ahh, man...
- How about 25?

10:06.912 --> 10:08.980
You got 25 bucks on you.

10:08.982 --> 10:10.481
I mean,
if it stays between us,

10:10.483 --> 10:12.449
- I've got $25.
- I'm not gonna tell anybody, man.

10:12.451 --> 10:13.985
All right, deal.

10:13.987 --> 10:15.220
I think Burke had
the right idea.

10:15.222 --> 10:16.920
It's about dump-30.

10:16.922 --> 10:18.224
So I'll see you in 20.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.925
Liam... you, um...

10:21.927 --> 10:23.928
you're not...

10:23.930 --> 10:25.866
gonna leave me
alone with this guy, right?

10:27.133 --> 10:29.202
Stop being such
a goddamn vagina, Tate.

10:37.877 --> 10:40.748
Quit staring at me,
you big-bearded bitch.

10:45.151 --> 10:46.853
Are you fucking deaf?

10:52.325 --> 10:54.494
I will fuck you up,
bitch-cake.

11:11.978 --> 11:13.577
That's, uh,

11:13.579 --> 11:16.514
quite a collection
you've got there.

11:16.516 --> 11:19.183
That's my personal
collection.

11:19.185 --> 11:21.919
Usually, the items
I acquire are something

11:21.921 --> 11:23.888
that have
theatrical presence.

11:23.890 --> 11:25.557
Impressive.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.826
I'd love to hear
more about this patient...

11:27.828 --> 11:29.494
3178, Doctor.

11:29.496 --> 11:32.896
Insurance purposes?
Seriously?

11:32.898 --> 11:35.533
Patient 3178

11:35.535 --> 11:39.470
is the most feared person
in the institute.

11:39.472 --> 11:40.972
Do share.

11:40.974 --> 11:42.173
As a young boy,

11:42.175 --> 11:44.375
Colin Miller
started hearing voices.

11:44.377 --> 11:46.944
Voices he claimed
came from an entity

11:46.946 --> 11:49.447
that only he could see.

11:49.449 --> 11:52.449
He called that entity
"the wicked one."

11:52.451 --> 11:56.187
He brutally murdered
his parents, sister,

11:56.189 --> 11:57.554
and five others

11:57.556 --> 11:59.591
before I acquired him.

11:59.593 --> 12:03.126
From the moment
he entered this establishment,

12:03.128 --> 12:05.929
Colin Miller
ceased to exist.

12:05.931 --> 12:08.232
Now, only
the Wicked One remains.

12:08.234 --> 12:10.137
Hmm, interesting.

12:15.507 --> 12:17.976
Tate?

12:17.978 --> 12:20.247
Lehman?

12:39.465 --> 12:40.533
Oh, fuck!

12:50.042 --> 12:51.576
(alarm blaring)

12:51.578 --> 12:54.379
Is that
what I think it is?

12:54.381 --> 12:56.083
It's impossible!

12:57.584 --> 13:00.451
Dr. Shaw, we have
to get you out of here.

13:00.453 --> 13:02.555
What the hell happened?

13:04.257 --> 13:06.024
The patient's escaped
from isolation.

13:06.026 --> 13:07.493
Oh, my God.

13:08.627 --> 13:11.397
(alarm blaring)

13:16.235 --> 13:17.270
Colin.

13:21.373 --> 13:23.643
What the hell happened
to that red state?

13:25.411 --> 13:28.346
I want all of you
to go back to your rooms.

13:28.348 --> 13:30.150

(sobbing)

15:52.592 --> 15:55.228
(sobbing)

16:26.158 --> 16:28.327
(crunching, splashing)

16:35.401 --> 16:37.735
(birds chirping)

16:37.737 --> 16:41.271
(man)
<i>♪ Hey... ♪</i>

16:41.273 --> 16:43.207
- There you go, babe.
- Thank you.

16:43.209 --> 16:44.808
I can't tell you guys
how stoked I am about

16:44.810 --> 16:47.211
- this Wicked Fest thing.
- I meant to ask you,

16:47.213 --> 16:48.779
so what are you
going for this year?

16:48.781 --> 16:50.515
Last year, you were
a naughty schoolgirl,

16:50.517 --> 16:51.915
and I think you looked
a little bit more like

16:51.917 --> 16:53.784
Velma from
"Scooby-Doo."

16:53.786 --> 16:55.385
(laughing)

16:55.387 --> 16:57.288
Contrary to your
point of view,

16:57.290 --> 17:00.357
Halloween isn't an excuse
to dress up like a dirty hooker.

17:00.359 --> 17:01.558
Liv, you're gonna be fine,

17:01.560 --> 17:03.397
no matter
what you decide to go as.

17:04.663 --> 17:06.363
So, this Wicked Fest,

17:06.365 --> 17:07.732
is it adult-oriented,

17:07.733 --> 17:09.599
or is it, like,
kid-friendly?

17:09.602 --> 17:11.169
Ahh, what's going on, guys?

17:11.171 --> 17:12.637
- Come in.
- What'd I miss?

17:12.638 --> 17:15.406
Well, Alex was about
to explain this whole

17:15.407 --> 17:17.909
Wicked Fest,
Dr. Destiny thing.

17:17.911 --> 17:21.178
Mm-mmm...
Chris, Dr. Dementia.

17:21.180 --> 17:23.613
- Oh...
- You know, like, the old-school Halloween host.

17:23.615 --> 17:25.815
- Mm-mmm.
- No.

17:25.817 --> 17:27.517
Okay, like, okay,

17:27.519 --> 17:28.953
Wolfula.

17:28.955 --> 17:30.655
- Nope.
- No.

17:30.657 --> 17:32.723
Morgas?

17:32.725 --> 17:34.559
- Try again.
- No.

17:34.561 --> 17:36.593
Oh, my God, really?

17:36.595 --> 17:38.295
Oh, my God... okay, Elvira.

17:38.297 --> 17:39.530
- Ahh!
- Thank you.

17:39.532 --> 17:41.265
Elvira was
fucking hot.

17:41.267 --> 17:42.499
- But still...
- Hey!

17:42.501 --> 17:44.302
So, it's like
a retro thing?

17:44.304 --> 17:46.269
...you'll love it.

17:46.271 --> 17:48.406
Let's face it, guys,
Halloween isn't

17:48.408 --> 17:49.707
what it used to be.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.842
Nowadays, kids go
in the church parking lots

17:51.844 --> 17:53.244
and football fields

17:53.246 --> 17:54.745
and walk 100 feet
to get their candy.

17:54.747 --> 17:56.680
You remember
when we were kids?

17:56.682 --> 17:58.248
Oh, my God,
it was so much more fun.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.717
- Mmm.
- I mean, you'd be two or three miles

17:59.719 --> 18:01.218
away from the house.

18:01.220 --> 18:03.787
No curfew.
One rule.

18:03.789 --> 18:05.823
Light wasn't on,
you ain't getting no candy.

18:05.825 --> 18:08.726
Those were the houses
that got egged and T.P.'d.

18:08.728 --> 18:09.927
Well, see,
we all have fond memories

18:09.929 --> 18:11.629
of Halloween as a kid.

18:11.631 --> 18:13.430
And that's what
Wicked Fest is doing.

18:13.432 --> 18:15.498
They're just trying
to stay true to...

18:15.500 --> 18:17.968
the meaning, in our
opinion, of Halloween.

18:17.970 --> 18:20.737
All the fun and...
there's music,

18:20.739 --> 18:22.840
there's entertainment,
there's liquor.

18:22.842 --> 18:24.475
Ooh, I like liquor.

18:24.477 --> 18:25.976
It's a blast, you guys are
gonna have a good time.

18:25.978 --> 18:28.411
- Sold.
- There's no clowns though, right?

18:28.413 --> 18:30.747
I cannot stand
clowns or carnivals.

18:30.749 --> 18:33.883
Seriously, they smell
like old cheese.

18:33.885 --> 18:35.652
And you remember
that sawdust stuff

18:35.654 --> 18:37.321
they used to clean up
the puke with

18:37.323 --> 18:39.590
- at elementary school?
- Eating!

18:39.592 --> 18:41.758
- Sorry.
- No, it's not a carnival.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.860
You're good.

18:42.862 --> 18:44.495
- Well, maybe...
- Sounds good.

18:44.497 --> 18:47.564
...we can find Awkward Annie
right here a man.

18:47.566 --> 18:48.832
(chuckling)
Ooh.

18:48.834 --> 18:50.333
Nice.

18:50.335 --> 18:51.669
As long as he's nothing
like you, Quinton,

18:51.671 --> 18:52.870
then I'm all for it.

18:52.872 --> 18:55.538
- Score, ouch.
- (buzzing)

18:55.540 --> 18:57.608
- Nice one.
- Thank you very much.

18:57.610 --> 18:59.313
I'm gonna get up.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.053
What do you want?

19:09.055 --> 19:11.054
(man)
<i>Well, hey to you too, sis.</i>

19:11.056 --> 19:12.689
What is it, Trevor?

19:12.691 --> 19:14.024
<i>You sound busy.</i>

19:14.026 --> 19:15.726
<i>Too busy to talk
to your own brother?</i>

19:15.728 --> 19:17.928
Maybe... you only call me
when you want me

19:17.930 --> 19:19.397
to get you out of
trouble or something,

19:19.399 --> 19:21.364
so is that
this kind of call or what?

19:21.366 --> 19:24.067
<i>(chuckling) ...it's funny
you should mention that.</i>

19:24.069 --> 19:26.339
(sighing)

19:31.443 --> 19:33.747
(engine starting)

19:36.949 --> 19:39.883
Hey, you okay?

19:39.885 --> 19:41.651
Not really.

19:41.653 --> 19:43.720
Who was that
on the phone?

19:43.722 --> 19:45.555
My brother.

19:45.557 --> 19:47.957
He's stranded and needs
somebody to pick him up.

19:47.959 --> 19:49.595
Oh, I see.

19:50.930 --> 19:52.899
I'm so sick
of my brother's shit.

19:55.434 --> 19:57.701
So, are we gonna
pick him up?

19:57.703 --> 19:59.469
I'm not keen on the idea.

19:59.471 --> 20:01.871
We both know
his track record.

20:01.873 --> 20:04.745
I don't wanna risk him
ruining this trip.

20:08.914 --> 20:11.114
Oh, God, you think we should
pick him up, don't you?

20:11.116 --> 20:12.615
I didn't say that,

20:12.617 --> 20:14.819
I was just,
you know, thinking...

20:14.821 --> 20:16.086
he is your brother.

20:16.088 --> 20:17.787
I haven't forgot that.

20:17.789 --> 20:20.457
But I also haven't forgotten
all the trouble he's caused.

20:20.459 --> 20:21.859
I've bailed him
out of jail,

20:21.861 --> 20:24.527
what, three times
in the last two years?

20:24.529 --> 20:26.063
Yeah, I know,
I know, it's...

20:26.065 --> 20:28.399
He's family.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.969
I mean, if he doesn't have
you, who else does he have?

20:31.536 --> 20:32.769
You know,
he doesn't even like you.

20:32.771 --> 20:35.038
Remember?
He stole your car

20:35.040 --> 20:36.940
and wrecked it
two years ago?

20:36.942 --> 20:39.142
Yeah, I remember
the car stunt.

20:39.144 --> 20:42.146
Even still, if...
you wanna pick him up,

20:42.148 --> 20:44.685
then so do I.

20:45.817 --> 20:47.720
This weekend's
all about us.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.494
(both chuckling)

20:56.496 --> 20:58.996
How did I get so lucky to get
such a great guy like you?

20:58.998 --> 21:01.832
Mmm, I believe it was
those black-lace thongs

21:01.834 --> 21:03.467
- you wore that one time.
- Shut up!

21:03.469 --> 21:05.104
(laughing)

21:06.873 --> 21:08.139
I'm not lying.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.573
Yo! Let's get the fucking
road on the show.

21:10.575 --> 21:12.578
- Come on!
- Let's go, guys!

22:06.966 --> 22:09.436
How are we supposed
to even find him anyway?

22:11.069 --> 22:13.536
Oh, the smell of cheap
cigarette smoke.

22:13.538 --> 22:14.974
Wait.

22:25.985 --> 22:28.052
Jesus Christ,
Trevor, a graveyard?

22:28.054 --> 22:30.019
Really?

22:30.021 --> 22:31.557
Hey, sis.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.758
What the hell
are you doing here?

22:35.760 --> 22:38.262
Oh, well-well-well,
if it isn't Sergeant Rock.

22:38.264 --> 22:40.063
Trev.

22:40.065 --> 22:41.966
How's Alexis?

22:41.968 --> 22:43.036
Come here!

22:44.836 --> 22:46.136
What the hell happened?

22:46.138 --> 22:48.037
Why are you here?

22:48.039 --> 22:49.739
It's just a little mishap,
that's all.

22:49.741 --> 22:51.774
- Mishap?
- Yeah.

22:51.776 --> 22:53.677
Look, I... I just needed
a ride, all right?

22:53.679 --> 22:55.079
- Trevor...
- Nothing to freak the fuck out about.

22:55.081 --> 22:56.880
Trevor!

22:56.882 --> 22:58.649
All right, fine,
I was in Geneva,

22:58.651 --> 22:59.883
conducting
some business.

22:59.885 --> 23:01.651
My ride bailed on me...
good enough?

23:01.653 --> 23:03.687
- Business?
- Yeah.

23:03.689 --> 23:05.288
Drugs.

23:05.290 --> 23:07.591
You were on a drug deal,
weren't you?

23:07.593 --> 23:09.259
God, I can't believe this.

23:09.261 --> 23:11.629
Hey, listen, back off,
Al, all right?

23:11.631 --> 23:13.229
Do I judge you
for your lifestyle?

23:13.231 --> 23:15.131
Job? Love interests?

23:15.133 --> 23:16.667
Are you serious
right now?

23:16.669 --> 23:17.868
About what...
yeah, like

23:17.870 --> 23:19.236
Mom and Dad would be
so disappointed...

23:19.238 --> 23:21.772
Don't you dare
bring them into this.

23:21.774 --> 23:23.274
Is everything
all right?

23:23.276 --> 23:25.708
Peachy,
never been better.

23:25.710 --> 23:28.312
You listen to me,
and you listen good.

23:28.314 --> 23:30.046
I'm hoping for
a fun, little getaway

23:30.048 --> 23:32.149
out at the farm,
and I am in no mood

23:32.151 --> 23:34.184
to deal with any of
your drama bullshit,

23:34.186 --> 23:35.753
do you understand me?

23:35.755 --> 23:37.554
What, the family old farm?

23:37.556 --> 23:39.156
Yes.

23:39.158 --> 23:40.256
Ahh.

23:40.258 --> 23:41.926
What now?

23:41.928 --> 23:44.093
Who's the chick with
the "Ugly Betty" glasses?

23:44.095 --> 23:46.063
She's kind of cute.

23:46.065 --> 23:47.665
I'm serious, Trevor.

23:47.667 --> 23:50.034
One fuckup, and I will
happily leave your ass

23:50.036 --> 23:52.572
on the side of the road,
are we clear?

23:53.940 --> 23:55.609
Yes, ma'am.

23:57.809 --> 23:59.245
Let's go.

24:11.056 --> 24:13.623
Guys...

24:13.625 --> 24:16.326
My ill-conceived brother.

24:16.328 --> 24:17.928
Hi, I'm Olivia.

24:17.930 --> 24:19.162
It's nice to meet you.

24:19.164 --> 24:21.599
Trevor.

24:21.601 --> 24:24.067
Fuck it... Quinton.
How's it going?

24:24.069 --> 24:26.803
This is my bodyguard, Chris.

24:26.805 --> 24:29.672
Um, weird, she's never
mentioned you before.

24:29.674 --> 24:31.274
We had no idea
she even had a brother.

24:31.276 --> 24:34.277
No, I'm sure
she hasn't.

24:34.279 --> 24:36.682
Don't make me regret this.

25:14.420 --> 25:16.156
(doorbell jingles)

25:19.225 --> 25:21.127
(doorbell jingles)

25:22.327 --> 25:23.930
Hello?

25:25.831 --> 25:27.132
Ms. McCoy?

25:51.123 --> 25:53.360
(man)
Hello?

25:55.161 --> 25:56.729
Ms. McCoy, you here?

26:01.801 --> 26:03.132
Hello?

26:03.134 --> 26:04.903
Ms. McCoy?

26:07.440 --> 26:08.839
Hello?

26:08.841 --> 26:10.644
Ms. McCoy?

26:18.150 --> 26:19.786
Ms. McCoy?

26:21.187 --> 26:23.256
You in here?

26:27.492 --> 26:28.827
Ms. McCoy?

26:53.119 --> 26:55.084
Well, there's
a sight for sore eyes.

26:55.086 --> 26:57.053
Hey, there,
Mr. Thatcher.

26:57.055 --> 26:58.488
You still letting this guy
tag along with you?

26:58.490 --> 27:00.457
- How you doing, Harry?
- Real good.

27:00.459 --> 27:02.959
Well, Norma cleaned y'all's
place for you yesterday.

27:02.961 --> 27:04.128
She'll be ready to go.

27:04.130 --> 27:05.763
- Thank you.
- You tell Norma

27:05.765 --> 27:07.230
- we greatly appreciate it.
- Ayuh.

27:07.232 --> 27:09.832
I won't keep you folks.
You all have a good time.

27:09.834 --> 27:11.435
Just remember,
if you need anything,

27:11.437 --> 27:12.503
you let us know.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.338
(Alexis)
Thank you.

27:14.340 --> 27:15.909
See you, Harry!

27:18.074 --> 27:19.011
(engine starting)

27:25.017 --> 27:26.419
See you!

27:29.988 --> 27:32.057
(crow cawing)

27:41.933 --> 27:43.302
(crow cawing)

27:54.345 --> 27:57.447
This is fucking legit!
Like, awesome.

27:57.449 --> 27:59.419
Yeah, it is.

28:01.219 --> 28:03.553
This is...
This is you?

28:03.555 --> 28:05.288
Alex, you said
you grew up comfortable.

28:05.290 --> 28:07.990
I had no idea you grew up
on fuckin' Skywalker Ranch.

28:07.992 --> 28:09.392
It's a goddamn
farmhouse,

28:09.394 --> 28:11.396
it's not the Grand
fuckin' Canyon.

28:13.097 --> 28:15.064
All right, Baby Gap.

28:15.066 --> 28:17.066
Let's unload
this shit.

28:17.068 --> 28:18.869
Hey, Trev!

28:18.871 --> 28:20.871
Would you just stop?

28:20.873 --> 28:22.438
What?

28:22.440 --> 28:24.373
Look, I know
this is difficult.

28:24.375 --> 28:26.610
Yeah, what?
What's difficult?

28:26.612 --> 28:29.278
Coming back here.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.314
Look, but I really think
it's what you need.

28:31.316 --> 28:33.015
You know what I need?
For you not to tell me

28:33.017 --> 28:35.419
what the fuck I need
all the time, all right?

28:35.421 --> 28:37.153
Do you think this shit
wasn't hard for me

28:37.155 --> 28:39.456
when I first came back?

28:39.458 --> 28:42.059
When I came back here,
I cried for days.

28:42.061 --> 28:44.898
I laid in our parents' bed,
I visited their graves.

28:47.466 --> 28:50.434
Those emotions that
you're feeling right now?

28:50.436 --> 28:52.169
I know them, okay?

28:52.171 --> 28:54.338
I felt them too, but...

28:54.340 --> 28:56.206
I promise, Trev,
it gets better.

28:56.208 --> 28:58.244
Day by day,
it will get better.

28:59.344 --> 29:00.913
(chuckling)

29:02.113 --> 29:04.183
Trev, please?

29:08.953 --> 29:10.454
No.

29:10.456 --> 29:12.825
(sniffling)

29:19.297 --> 29:22.565
(sighing)

29:22.567 --> 29:24.133
Hey, man, you gonna
be able to make up

29:24.135 --> 29:25.435
with the sibling
this weekend?

29:25.437 --> 29:27.204
I'm gonna try, Quint,
but that motherfucker's

29:27.206 --> 29:28.975
not making it
any easier.

29:30.241 --> 29:31.877
(sighing)

29:33.379 --> 29:35.144
You fucking told him
one of those war stories, right?

29:35.146 --> 29:37.014
You fucking did, you...
whatever, you shoot, like,

29:37.016 --> 29:39.049
13 guys with two bullets.

29:39.051 --> 29:40.284
No, but I should've.

29:40.286 --> 29:42.018
Maybe he'd keep
his fucking mouth shut.

29:42.020 --> 29:44.420
Throw some
fear of God into him.

29:44.422 --> 29:46.555
You know, man...

29:46.557 --> 29:49.258
Alex and I's relationship is
damn near perfect.

29:49.260 --> 29:50.560
She's perfect.

29:50.562 --> 29:53.030
The only fucking
glitch is him.

29:53.032 --> 29:54.497
(sighing)
Lord knows...

29:54.499 --> 29:56.132
I try to keep
my mouth shut,

29:56.134 --> 29:59.069
but he's got the mouth
of a 16-year-old girl.

29:59.071 --> 30:00.469
It's all pissy.

30:00.471 --> 30:02.238
And all I wanna do
is put my hands

30:02.240 --> 30:04.006
around his fucking
little throat and...

30:04.008 --> 30:05.342
(mimics cracking)

30:05.344 --> 30:06.575
But what're you gonna do?

30:16.587 --> 30:18.423

30:24.296 --> 30:26.095
Excuse me.

30:26.097 --> 30:28.130
I'm in need
of some directions, please.

30:28.132 --> 30:30.199
- Where are you heading?
- Well, I'm trying to find

30:30.201 --> 30:32.703
1428 Pruitt Road.

30:32.705 --> 30:35.008
The old Miller place.

30:36.408 --> 30:37.610
Yes.

30:39.644 --> 30:41.544
What in the hell would
a spiffy old lady like you

30:41.546 --> 30:43.080
wanna do out there?

30:43.082 --> 30:44.747

30:44.749 --> 30:48.485
This is the third stop
I've made since I left.

30:48.487 --> 30:50.987
Now, can you give me
directions or not?

30:50.989 --> 30:53.457
And before you say
another word,

30:53.459 --> 30:56.994

any of your country-fied,

31:03.035 --> 31:06.339
Relax, I'm gonna
give you directions.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.375
Good.

31:11.509 --> 31:13.142
You know,
that place is tainted.

31:13.144 --> 31:15.312
It's cursed.

31:15.314 --> 31:18.584
Every time someone goes
out there, they die.

31:53.419 --> 31:55.619
There you go.

31:55.621 --> 31:58.421
Oh, I knew there was a reason
I asked you to marry me.

31:58.423 --> 32:01.291
Mm-hmm.

32:01.293 --> 32:02.758
So, we're all sitting
around a fire,

32:02.760 --> 32:05.130
and it's All Hallow's Eve.

32:06.731 --> 32:08.300
Does anybody know
any ghost stories?

32:10.635 --> 32:12.535
Have you ever heard
of "the wicked one"?

32:12.537 --> 32:14.272
"The wicked one"?

32:15.774 --> 32:18.441
See, you guys grew up
afraid of ghosts.

32:18.443 --> 32:20.209
And boogeymen.

32:20.211 --> 32:23.080
It's not the same for
the people of Carpenter Hills.

32:23.082 --> 32:26.582
Here...
it's "the wicked one"

32:26.584 --> 32:29.119
whose name is feared
above all else.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.254
Catchy name.

32:31.256 --> 32:33.689
He was just a teenager.

32:33.691 --> 32:35.492
Your normal,
run-of-the-mill,

32:35.494 --> 32:40.596
average, good...
family kid.

32:40.598 --> 32:42.832
Until one day...

32:42.834 --> 32:44.670
he just snapped.

32:46.337 --> 32:50.140
Slaughtered
his entire family.

32:50.142 --> 32:51.608
When they found him,

32:51.610 --> 32:53.509
he was in the basement.

32:53.511 --> 32:58.247
Completely covered
in his family's blood.

32:58.249 --> 33:01.751
Sitting in front of
his dead sister's body.

33:01.753 --> 33:04.720
So, they locked him away.

33:04.722 --> 33:07.657
And for 20 years...

33:07.659 --> 33:11.430
there's been a stigma
over Carpenter Falls.

33:13.731 --> 33:16.198
Oh, come on.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.134
It's the same story
everywhere you go.

33:18.136 --> 33:19.902
Like, some guy
does something...

33:19.904 --> 33:21.505
some horrible crime,

33:21.507 --> 33:23.806
the police arrest him...
every now and then,

33:23.808 --> 33:26.243
the people around
the town see him.

33:26.245 --> 33:28.144
And it's like the...

33:28.146 --> 33:31.281
it's the same tired-ass,
lame story wherever you go.

33:31.283 --> 33:32.448
(Trevor) Problem is,
Fear and Loathing,

33:32.450 --> 33:34.754
that, uh...
it's a true story.

33:36.822 --> 33:39.622
All right,
but the burning question is...

33:39.624 --> 33:43.860
is why did this kid go all
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs?

33:43.862 --> 33:45.528
He said
he heard a voice.

33:45.530 --> 33:48.765
A voice that came from
his family's scarecrow.

33:48.767 --> 33:50.867
(Quinton)
Aww, a fuckin' scarecrow.

33:50.869 --> 33:52.902
- It's true.
- Ca-caw!

33:52.904 --> 33:55.705
(laughing)
Okay, all right.

33:55.707 --> 33:57.640
(Trevor) Yeah, I
wouldn't laugh too hard.

33:57.642 --> 34:01.277
See, the part of the story
that she's not telling you

34:01.279 --> 34:04.447
is that the land that
the Miller house was on...

34:04.449 --> 34:06.949
(clicks tongue)

34:06.951 --> 34:09.252
This land?

34:09.254 --> 34:12.656
The... land that
we're on right now?

34:12.658 --> 34:14.824
See, uh,

34:14.826 --> 34:17.226
after the murders
and everything,

34:17.228 --> 34:19.196
my pop came in here.

34:19.197 --> 34:20.864
Purchased up the property.

34:20.866 --> 34:22.665
Built a house.

34:22.667 --> 34:24.768
On the other side
of the property,

34:24.770 --> 34:26.670
the old house is
still there.

34:26.672 --> 34:30.239
So, what you're saying
is that this wicked guy

34:30.241 --> 34:32.908
is still alive in some
sanitarium somewhere?

34:32.909 --> 34:34.578
Shouldn't he have
gotten the death penalty

34:34.580 --> 34:35.779
- or something?
- Yeah.

34:35.781 --> 34:37.813
Well, you can't
execute the crazies

34:37.815 --> 34:39.516
if they've been...

34:39.518 --> 34:41.850
deemed mentally unfit
to stand trial.

34:41.851 --> 34:43.752
Kinda like
Charles Manson?

34:43.754 --> 34:45.955
You know, they just kind of
live their own lives

34:45.956 --> 34:47.757
in their own
fucked-up head.

34:47.759 --> 34:50.359
Not knowing right
from wrong.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.830
Ever the optimist.

34:55.366 --> 34:56.866
Rather an optimist
than a...

34:56.868 --> 34:59.536
nagging, negative
sack of shit, eh, Trev?

34:59.538 --> 35:00.804
(clearing throat)

35:00.806 --> 35:02.772
Better put a leash
on that dog, sis.

35:02.774 --> 35:05.841
Don't try to wrangle
your sister into this, Trevor.

35:05.843 --> 35:07.844
Guys, we're not
doing this.

35:07.846 --> 35:09.946
Let Mr. Billy Bad-Ass
say what he wants.

35:09.948 --> 35:12.482
- I'm all ears.
- You know what?

35:12.484 --> 35:14.650
You're not impressing
anyone here

35:14.652 --> 35:16.752
with your sarcastic,
witty little comebacks.

35:16.754 --> 35:18.323
Cut the fucking act,
it's getting old.

35:20.392 --> 35:22.859
Listen, I know because
you're banging my sister...

35:22.861 --> 35:24.661
- Trevor!
...that you think you have some sort of

35:24.663 --> 35:26.429
authority over me.

35:26.431 --> 35:28.330
You don't.

35:28.332 --> 35:29.732
So, how about you sit
over there and just drink

35:29.734 --> 35:31.333
your fucking Sea Breeze

35:31.335 --> 35:33.969

35:33.971 --> 35:35.772

tired of your shit.

Oh, God... hey, stop.

35:38.944 --> 35:41.277
It ain't nothing in between
us but fucking air.

35:41.279 --> 35:43.446
So, why don't
you try it, Cheech?

35:43.448 --> 35:46.551
Hey, guys, no, we're not
gonna do this right now.

35:47.852 --> 35:49.551
You think
you're tough shit?

35:49.553 --> 35:50.920
Walk around
with your little backpack

35:50.922 --> 35:52.855
like a pre-schooler?

35:52.857 --> 35:54.991
We all know
what's in it.

35:54.993 --> 35:56.493
And I'm betting
it's enough to send you away

35:56.495 --> 35:59.728
for a long fucking time.

35:59.730 --> 36:01.297
You know what?

36:01.299 --> 36:03.333
Let's just fucking see
what's in it, huh?

36:03.335 --> 36:04.337
Fuck you, man.

36:05.803 --> 36:06.902
Stop... hey!

36:06.904 --> 36:08.640
- Guys...
- Oh, shit!

36:11.343 --> 36:13.676
Adam! Adam!
Stop it!

36:13.678 --> 36:15.779
Stop it,

36:15.781 --> 36:17.846
Let's see what's so fucking
goddamn important...

36:17.848 --> 36:18.948
- Oh, shit!
- Trevor...

36:18.950 --> 36:20.616
- Sit!
- Yes, sir.

36:20.618 --> 36:22.685

36:22.687 --> 36:24.788
what the fuck are you
doing with a gun?

36:24.790 --> 36:26.823
Put it down.
Trevor, please.

36:26.825 --> 36:29.091
For Christ's sake,
put it down.

36:29.093 --> 36:30.893
Look at what you're doing,
Trevor, please.

36:30.895 --> 36:32.995
I'm not gonna
ask you again, Chief.

36:32.997 --> 36:35.332
Put it down, or I'll put
a fucking hole in your head

36:35.334 --> 36:37.900
that matches
your leg, savvy?

36:37.902 --> 36:40.469
You know, I thought
you were better than this.

36:40.471 --> 36:42.605
But now I can see you're
just a pistol-pulling pussy.

36:42.607 --> 36:43.940
Hope you got
the fucking balls

36:43.942 --> 36:45.741
to pull that trigger
when you need to.

36:45.743 --> 36:48.377

36:48.379 --> 36:50.112
This fucking bag?
Gonna shoot me

36:50.114 --> 36:52.915
if I don't give you
your shit back?

36:52.917 --> 36:54.951
That's the point
of the piece in your face.

36:54.953 --> 36:56.685
Now, what's it gonna be?

36:56.687 --> 36:59.455
Everybody knows
what's in it, so let him.

You think you're fucking
better than me? Do you?

37:11.535 --> 37:13.103
No, Trevor, no.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.937
Shut the fuck up, Al!

37:14.939 --> 37:17.841

and fucking tired

37:17.843 --> 37:20.379

and comments.

37:21.812 --> 37:24.681

as fucking easy as you.

37:24.683 --> 37:26.649
Poor little Alexandra.

37:26.651 --> 37:28.150

37:28.152 --> 37:29.886

her dipshit brother.

Huh?

40:06.011 --> 40:07.310
(man)
<i>Samhain!</i>

40:07.312 --> 40:09.112
(woman)
<i>The Day of the Dead!</i>

40:09.114 --> 40:10.647
(man)
<i>Whatever you call it,</i>

40:10.649 --> 40:12.080
<i>it's our favorite time
of the year!</i>

40:12.082 --> 40:13.815
- <i>And it's finally here!</i>
- (gurgling)

40:13.817 --> 40:15.919
<i>Now's your chance
to get all messed up</i>

40:15.921 --> 40:19.656
<i>at the annual spook-tacular
called Wicked Fest!</i>

40:19.658 --> 40:22.324
(woman) <i>The monster-mash
of the century!</i>

40:22.326 --> 40:24.964
<i>Wicked Fest!
Catch fire! Bam!</i>

40:33.004 --> 40:34.239
(screaming)

40:35.674 --> 40:37.710
- No! No...
- (knife plunging)

40:51.989 --> 40:54.926
(crickets chirping)

41:00.098 --> 41:02.364
(footsteps)

41:02.366 --> 41:04.067
Morning.

41:04.069 --> 41:06.105
Hey.

41:07.238 --> 41:08.870
So...

41:08.872 --> 41:10.772
last night was
a little insane.

41:10.774 --> 41:12.241
(chuckling)

41:12.243 --> 41:13.942
Yeah, you could say that.

41:13.944 --> 41:16.011
You guys probably thought
you were watching...

41:16.013 --> 41:18.915
an episode of "Springer"
or something, huh?

41:18.917 --> 41:21.083
Well, I mean,
I'd be lying if I said

41:21.085 --> 41:23.752
I wasn't
pretty terrified.

41:23.754 --> 41:27.058
I'm gonna see about getting
Trevor to a bus stop today.

41:29.627 --> 41:32.194
If you don't
mind me asking,

41:32.196 --> 41:34.397
what made him snap?

41:34.399 --> 41:36.734
Why is he always
so amped up?

41:40.138 --> 41:42.040
There's a little backstory.

41:43.274 --> 41:47.009
With me, Trevor,
parents...

41:47.011 --> 41:48.913
that's kind of difficult.

41:53.018 --> 41:55.984
Trevor got in
a lot of trouble.

41:55.986 --> 41:57.687
He was out partying
one night,

41:57.689 --> 42:00.989
and it got really bad.

42:00.991 --> 42:04.763
And they called my parents
to come pick him up.

42:06.297 --> 42:09.998
That's when
the accident happened.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.301
Ever since then,
Trevor's blamed himself

42:12.303 --> 42:14.103
for them being killed.

42:14.105 --> 42:16.438
He just...

42:16.440 --> 42:18.241
emotionally,
he can't heal from it.

42:18.243 --> 42:21.109
It's like he can't cope.

42:21.111 --> 42:22.814
You know?

42:24.815 --> 42:27.817
It's gotta be really hard
for him to be back here, Alex.

42:27.819 --> 42:29.719
You have
to understand that.

42:29.721 --> 42:32.288
Yesterday, you said yourself
it was hard to be back here.

42:32.290 --> 42:34.457
Knowing that...
and all that guilt

42:34.459 --> 42:39.094
he carries around with him
on a daily basis...

42:39.096 --> 42:41.132
it's gotta be
drowning him right now.

42:43.033 --> 42:45.870
I mean, seriously, try
easing up on him, you know?

42:47.238 --> 42:50.205
Maybe even...

42:50.207 --> 42:51.808
I don't know...

42:51.810 --> 42:53.112
give him another chance?

43:00.118 --> 43:01.987
What?

43:04.189 --> 43:06.855
Are you crushing
on my brother right now?

43:06.857 --> 43:08.857
(scoffs)

43:08.859 --> 43:10.826
(laughs)

43:10.828 --> 43:14.830
No... no,
uh-uh, no, no.

43:14.832 --> 43:16.364
He's your brother.

43:16.366 --> 43:19.134
I mean...
yeah, he's cute...

43:19.136 --> 43:20.469
- Oh, God.
- But that's not...

43:20.471 --> 43:22.270
that's not
why I'm saying this.

43:22.272 --> 43:24.841
No... no.

43:24.843 --> 43:26.241
Trevor's just...

43:26.243 --> 43:27.877
Trevor just...

43:27.879 --> 43:28.913
(Trevor)
Trevor just what?

43:30.982 --> 43:32.750
(opening fridge)

43:34.986 --> 43:35.953
(closing fridge)

43:40.125 --> 43:42.327
Trevor, what are you
looking for?

43:44.294 --> 43:46.230
Aspirin.

43:54.538 --> 43:56.441
(rattling)

43:59.977 --> 44:01.412
Thanks.

44:07.484 --> 44:09.253
(door closing)

44:12.422 --> 44:16.192
I tell you what,
let me talk to him.

44:16.194 --> 44:18.027
Maybe he just needs
an ear to vent to.

44:18.029 --> 44:19.995
Looking for
perspective, something.

44:19.997 --> 44:21.364
No.

44:21.366 --> 44:23.498
Liv, honey, you know
how he is with people.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.433
You're gonna
let him rope you in.

44:25.435 --> 44:27.203
- I'll be fine.
- No...

44:27.205 --> 44:28.870
I promise.

44:28.872 --> 44:30.272
(chuckling)

44:30.274 --> 44:32.007
God...

44:32.009 --> 44:35.046
This is not happening.

44:44.122 --> 44:45.520
Hey...

44:45.522 --> 44:48.190
Need an inhaler?

44:48.192 --> 44:50.493
I'll survive.

44:50.495 --> 44:53.129
You care
if I tag along?

44:53.131 --> 44:54.596
I won't stop you.

44:54.598 --> 44:56.565
(birds chirping, cawing)

44:56.567 --> 44:59.167
What's with the truck?

44:59.169 --> 45:01.372
My unsafe teenage rebellion
was a bitch.

45:06.611 --> 45:08.277
You, uh...

45:08.279 --> 45:10.549
You got another
one of those?

45:13.618 --> 45:15.554
Sure.

45:27.165 --> 45:29.101
(coughing)

45:35.138 --> 45:37.105
What are you doing?

45:37.107 --> 45:39.341
What?

45:39.343 --> 45:41.310
This whole thing.

45:41.312 --> 45:43.448
(chuckling) I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:45.950 --> 45:49.118
So what's the story
with you?

45:49.120 --> 45:50.886
What do you mean?

45:50.888 --> 45:52.388
I mean,
with you and Alex

45:52.390 --> 45:55.357
and the rest
of her club.

45:55.359 --> 45:57.225
We're friends.

45:57.227 --> 46:01.096
We're friends,
and we're going to Wicked Fest.

46:01.098 --> 46:03.031
What about you?

46:03.033 --> 46:04.966
Not really my thing.

46:04.968 --> 46:06.502
You should come.

46:06.504 --> 46:08.440
It couldn't hurt.

46:14.946 --> 46:17.480
So, uh...
is this the first time

46:17.482 --> 46:19.351
you've been back here
since, um...

46:21.953 --> 46:24.520
Yeah.

46:24.522 --> 46:27.989
It's a beautiful place.

46:27.991 --> 46:29.591
Yeah, been gone
for so long,

46:29.593 --> 46:32.995
I kinda forgot
how nice it was out here.

46:32.997 --> 46:35.464
Me and Alex, we, uh,

46:35.466 --> 46:38.600
we used to run, hell,
all up and down these hills.

46:38.602 --> 46:40.502
So, what's the deal
with all the tension

46:40.504 --> 46:42.440
and cynicism
between you two?

46:45.109 --> 46:46.475
I don't know.

46:46.477 --> 46:49.281
Just kind of the way
shit is, I guess.

46:57.087 --> 46:59.388
Holy shit.

46:59.390 --> 47:01.123
That's it, isn't it?

47:01.125 --> 47:02.257
Yeah.

47:02.259 --> 47:04.292
So it wasn't just
a bullshit story.

47:04.294 --> 47:07.629
Eh, it's the old
Miller murder mansion.

47:07.631 --> 47:09.230
Wanna go inside?

47:09.232 --> 47:11.433
Hell no.

47:11.435 --> 47:12.667
Scared?

47:12.669 --> 47:14.536
Fuck, yeah, I'm scared!

47:14.538 --> 47:17.505
You'd have to be crazy
to go in there.

47:17.507 --> 47:21.344
I'm not doing it.

47:21.346 --> 47:23.212
Yeah, actually now,
I think about it,

47:23.214 --> 47:24.446
I think
you might be standing

47:24.448 --> 47:26.415
where he killed his dad.

47:26.417 --> 47:28.183
Shut up.

47:28.185 --> 47:30.187
I'm fucking with you.
Come on.

47:33.223 --> 47:35.757
So... have you ever
thought of maybe

47:35.759 --> 47:38.094
moving back out here?

47:38.096 --> 47:40.129
I mean,
technically speaking

47:40.131 --> 47:42.098
this is your land.

47:42.100 --> 47:43.732
No, no,
it's my parents' land.

47:43.734 --> 47:47.002
Well, to me, it is.

47:47.004 --> 47:50.239
But, I mean, it might be
just what you need.

47:50.241 --> 47:53.074
You know, a new start.

47:53.076 --> 47:56.178
Maybe find yourself
one of those nice girls.

47:56.180 --> 47:59.248
Oh, yeah? What kind
of nice girl'd want me?

47:59.250 --> 48:02.551
Come on, you have to have
had girlfriends before.

48:02.553 --> 48:05.654
Yeah, some.
None serious.

48:05.656 --> 48:08.223
So...

48:08.225 --> 48:11.761
Find a serious one.

48:11.763 --> 48:13.699
I'll see what I can do.

48:16.167 --> 48:18.100
- So...
- (sighs)

48:18.102 --> 48:21.337
What are you
going as tonight?

48:21.339 --> 48:23.371
It's a surprise.

48:23.373 --> 48:24.806
Are we talking...

48:24.808 --> 48:27.475
scary surprise
or sexy surprise?

48:27.477 --> 48:30.045
Mmm, you'll just
have to wait and see.

48:30.047 --> 48:31.580
(chuckling)

48:31.582 --> 48:32.748
What about you?

48:32.750 --> 48:34.250
What are you gonna do?

48:34.252 --> 48:36.618
I'm going
as "Supernatural".

48:36.620 --> 48:39.422
Huh?

48:39.424 --> 48:41.257
The TV show?
My favorite show?

48:41.259 --> 48:43.458
- "Supernatural."
- I... I know that,

48:43.460 --> 48:46.362
but I... I...
I still don't get it.

48:46.364 --> 48:50.266
I got my...
green jacket as Dean.

48:50.268 --> 48:51.734
"Sam!"

48:51.736 --> 48:54.437
I got the long hair,
like Sam.

48:54.439 --> 48:55.603
"Dean!"

48:55.605 --> 48:58.406
And I got the trucker hat,
like Bobby.

48:58.408 --> 49:00.344
"Balls and idjits!"

49:02.279 --> 49:04.112
Don't judge me.

49:04.114 --> 49:06.582
I ain't judging, I'm just
trying to figure you out.

49:06.584 --> 49:08.716
Best costume
of the night.

49:08.718 --> 49:12.120
- Well, that's your opinion.
- (giggles)

49:12.122 --> 49:13.556
Get up, get up, get up.
Look, look-look-look.

49:13.558 --> 49:14.790
What?

49:14.792 --> 49:16.292
- I'll be damned.
- Oh!

49:16.294 --> 49:18.096
Hey, you guys!

49:21.165 --> 49:22.630
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

49:22.632 --> 49:23.766
Mm-mmm.

49:23.768 --> 49:25.366
We can't let this happen.

49:25.368 --> 49:26.634
Heh, too late.

49:26.636 --> 49:28.437
- No, no, we can't just...
- Look at them.

49:28.439 --> 49:29.638
Hey, guys.

49:29.640 --> 49:30.839
What's up, guys?

49:30.841 --> 49:32.808
Oh, you know,
not much.

49:32.810 --> 49:35.176
Whatcha been doing?
Where you been?

49:35.178 --> 49:37.245
Trevor was just showing me
around the property.

49:37.247 --> 49:40.449
Hmm, wasn't that
nice of Trevor?

49:40.451 --> 49:42.650
Yeah, we even saw
the old Miller place.

49:42.652 --> 49:44.589
- Ooh.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

49:49.359 --> 49:51.462
Come on, we need
to have a talk.

49:59.236 --> 50:01.636
I guess you and me
need to have a talk.

50:01.638 --> 50:03.304
Is that so?

50:03.306 --> 50:07.442
Yes, yes, that's so.

50:07.444 --> 50:09.911
Hmm.

50:09.913 --> 50:11.480
Floor is all yours.

50:11.482 --> 50:14.686
Look, about last night...

50:17.488 --> 50:19.855
Listen, if you're looking
for an apology, man...

50:19.857 --> 50:22.828
That's not really
your style now, is it, Trev?

50:25.228 --> 50:26.428
What's that
supposed to mean?

50:26.430 --> 50:29.498
Exactly how it sounded.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.199
Look, it's no secret

50:31.201 --> 50:34.170
we're not
the best of buds.

50:34.172 --> 50:35.774
I just want you
to know something.

50:38.341 --> 50:39.641
I love your sister,

50:39.643 --> 50:41.844
and I would do anything
in the world for her.

50:41.846 --> 50:43.879
Even put up with
her asshole brother

50:43.881 --> 50:45.948
for as long as
she wanted me to.

50:45.950 --> 50:48.283
You want to know why?

50:48.285 --> 50:49.484
Because that's
the shit you do

50:49.486 --> 50:51.587
for somebody
that you love.

50:51.589 --> 50:54.355
Now, I wouldn't expect you
to understand that,

50:54.357 --> 50:57.359
but somewhere deep down
in that thick skull of yours,

50:57.361 --> 50:58.726
you have to care
about your sister

50:58.728 --> 51:00.895
and if she's being
taken care of.

51:00.897 --> 51:03.364
I don't care
if you like me.

51:03.366 --> 51:06.534
You don't have to.
I don't give a shit.

51:06.536 --> 51:09.638
But at least
respect the fact

51:09.640 --> 51:11.674
that I'm the man
that loves your sister

51:11.676 --> 51:14.509
and is gonna be around
for a very long time.

51:14.511 --> 51:17.745
So... let's just try to...

51:17.747 --> 51:20.683
coexist the rest
of the weekend for her sake.

51:20.685 --> 51:21.783
And after this weekend,
I'll take you

51:21.785 --> 51:24.620
wherever you want to go.

51:24.622 --> 51:26.754
(insect buzzing)

51:26.756 --> 51:28.159
Fine.

51:30.694 --> 51:32.828
Good talk.

51:32.830 --> 51:34.263
Adam.

51:34.265 --> 51:35.866
Yeah?

51:37.602 --> 51:39.868
You touch me
or that bag again,

51:39.870 --> 51:42.370
my sister won't be able
to stop me next time.

51:42.372 --> 51:44.672
Fair enough.

51:44.674 --> 51:47.609
But if you ever pull
a gun on me again,

51:47.611 --> 51:49.547
I'll beat you
to death with it.

51:55.819 --> 51:57.756
Dick.

52:00.457 --> 52:01.790
Quinton.

52:01.792 --> 52:04.292
Hey, what's going on, man?

52:04.294 --> 52:07.328
What the hell
are you doing?

52:07.330 --> 52:08.464
Man, I'm just looking
in one of these barns

52:08.466 --> 52:09.832
trying to, I don't know,

52:09.834 --> 52:13.502

52:15.973 --> 52:17.538

52:17.540 --> 52:19.341
You'd be correct, sir.

52:19.343 --> 52:21.710
Thought we would, uh,

52:21.712 --> 52:24.580
take that opportunity...

52:24.582 --> 52:27.415
have a little bit of, uh,

52:32.056 --> 52:36.759
I was... going for
romantic fine dining.

52:36.761 --> 52:40.763
Hmm, okay, and you're
looking in a tool shed.

52:40.765 --> 52:43.431
Okay, sorry to break it

out already.

01:05:34.337 --> 01:05:36.437
I just... I gotta get
something in my stomach,

01:05:36.439 --> 01:05:38.605
and I'll be fine.

01:05:38.607 --> 01:05:39.841
Okay, well,
then let's go get you

01:05:39.843 --> 01:05:41.643
some food
in your belly.

01:05:41.645 --> 01:05:42.810
You got her?

01:05:42.812 --> 01:05:45.212
Lead the way.

01:05:45.214 --> 01:05:47.315
Come on.

01:05:47.317 --> 01:05:48.583
That's it.

01:05:48.585 --> 01:05:52.152
(insects chirping,
birds hooting)

01:05:52.154 --> 01:05:55.091
(animals howling,
wings flapping)

01:06:05.335 --> 01:06:07.734
Quinton?

01:06:07.736 --> 01:06:10.504
Stop fucking around, babe.

01:06:10.506 --> 01:06:13.174
Where are you?

01:06:13.176 --> 01:06:15.746
(screams)

01:06:19.315 --> 01:06:21.815
Good thing we brought
food with us, huh?

01:06:21.817 --> 01:06:24.252
(Trevor)
No shit.

01:06:24.254 --> 01:06:26.190
Chick's got a mouth
like a vacuum.

01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:31.259
Well, not in a sexual way.

01:06:31.261 --> 01:06:32.826
What?

01:06:32.828 --> 01:06:34.862
Fuck you guys.
I'm going to bed.

01:06:34.864 --> 01:06:36.464
Hey, your little
girlfriend here

01:06:36.466 --> 01:06:37.498
might want to
go with you.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.632
Still hate you.

01:06:38.634 --> 01:06:40.437
Still hate you, too.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.109
(chuckles)

01:07:03.792 --> 01:07:05.128
What the fuck?

01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:14.868
(groaning)

01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:16.806
Unh!

01:07:25.881 --> 01:07:28.183
Unh!

01:07:28.185 --> 01:07:31.386
(moaning)

01:07:31.388 --> 01:07:33.324
Unh!

01:07:38.661 --> 01:07:41.763
Seems like Adam's been gone
a really long time.

01:07:41.765 --> 01:07:43.431
Yeah, I know.

01:07:43.433 --> 01:07:44.665
(Trevor)
Yeah, you know what?

01:07:44.667 --> 01:07:47.835
Adam, he's still
not back yet.

01:07:47.837 --> 01:07:49.404
Oh, what, you afraid
your ex-military boyfriend

01:07:49.406 --> 01:07:50.737
can't handle himself?

01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:53.975
Asshole.
I'm gonna go look for him.

01:07:53.977 --> 01:07:56.777
- Wait.
- Wait what?

01:07:56.779 --> 01:07:58.312
You're not going
out there by yourself.

01:07:58.314 --> 01:07:59.948
I'll be fine, Trev.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:03.484
Hold on, I'm coming with.

01:08:03.486 --> 01:08:05.752
(exhales)

01:08:05.754 --> 01:08:07.557
(silently)
What the fuck?

01:08:13.363 --> 01:08:15.429
What's with the gun?

01:08:15.431 --> 01:08:16.663
I feel better wandering
around the dark

01:08:16.666 --> 01:08:18.932
with this puppy, so...

01:08:18.934 --> 01:08:20.504
Mine.

01:08:24.773 --> 01:08:26.540
Don't shoot your dick off.

01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:28.709
Hmm.
Maybe just yours.

01:08:28.711 --> 01:08:31.645
I'm not staying here
by myself.

01:08:31.648 --> 01:08:33.615
Honey, you'll be fine.
We won't be gone that long.

01:08:33.617 --> 01:08:34.816
So the two of you get guns

01:08:34.818 --> 01:08:36.618
and I get to stay here
by myself?

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.917
No!

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.553
Fuck both of you.
I'm coming.

01:08:39.555 --> 01:08:41.755
Looks like she's coming with.

01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:42.788
(cocks rifle)

01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:46.359
All right.

01:08:46.362 --> 01:08:48.298
(insects chirping)

01:08:51.734 --> 01:08:54.667
Christ, it's cold
out here.

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:56.270
Adam!

01:08:56.273 --> 01:08:57.671
He's crazy for coming
out here

01:08:57.674 --> 01:08:58.772
this late at night.

01:08:58.774 --> 01:09:00.642
- (chuckles)
- Especially on Halloween.

01:09:00.644 --> 01:09:02.042
Adam!

01:09:02.045 --> 01:09:03.511
You know, I saw
this show last night,

01:09:03.513 --> 01:09:05.011
and they said
more people disappear

01:09:05.014 --> 01:09:06.380
on Halloween than any other
day of the year...

01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:07.881
Olivia!

01:09:07.884 --> 01:09:10.384
Would you just chill?

01:09:10.386 --> 01:09:12.020
That wasn't here before.

01:09:12.022 --> 01:09:14.488
What?

01:09:14.491 --> 01:09:16.426
Oh, my God, it's Adam!

01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:21.495
Adam! Adam!

01:09:21.497 --> 01:09:22.729
Whoa-Whoa-Whoa,
let's get him down.

01:09:22.732 --> 01:09:23.997
Let's get him down,
let's get him down.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.371
(whirring)

01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:41.348
Adam? Adam, wake up,
please wake up!

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:42.783
Adam!

01:09:42.786 --> 01:09:44.051
(groaning)

01:09:44.054 --> 01:09:45.453
Alex?

01:09:45.455 --> 01:09:46.987
Oh, my God,
what happened?

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:48.721
- We gotta go...
- Whoa, whoa, stay down.

01:09:48.724 --> 01:09:49.990
Stay down,
sarge, stay down.

01:09:49.992 --> 01:09:52.526
- A man...
- A man what?

01:09:52.528 --> 01:09:54.494
There's a man
in a burlap mask!

01:09:54.496 --> 01:09:55.829
We gotta go!

01:09:55.831 --> 01:09:57.867
Oh, God!

01:09:59.102 --> 01:10:00.834
Wait, wait,
where's your keys?

01:10:00.836 --> 01:10:02.570
I don't know,
they're gone!

01:10:02.572 --> 01:10:04.338
What the fuck you mean,
"they're gone"?

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.707
What do we do?

01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:07.441
Chris and Quin,
they're at the other bar.

01:10:07.443 --> 01:10:09.110
He always leaves
his keys in his car.

01:10:09.112 --> 01:10:10.677
We need it.

01:10:10.679 --> 01:10:12.646
Okay, hey, hey,
look at me, look at me.

01:10:12.648 --> 01:10:13.847
I need you to go
to the other bar

01:10:13.849 --> 01:10:15.350
and get...
listen to me.

01:10:15.352 --> 01:10:16.851
Yes, yes, you can,
yes, you can.

01:10:16.853 --> 01:10:18.919
Be strong,
go as fast as you can.

01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:21.121
Do not stop,
you understand?

01:10:21.123 --> 01:10:22.656
What is this?

01:10:22.658 --> 01:10:23.857
All you have to do...

01:10:23.859 --> 01:10:25.093
all you have to do
is cock it and...

01:10:25.095 --> 01:10:27.094
- Alex, I can't!
- Yes, you can, honey.

01:10:27.096 --> 01:10:29.496
You can do this, okay?
Just hurry!

01:10:29.498 --> 01:10:30.530
Go!

01:10:30.532 --> 01:10:31.801
Go!

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.103
- Honey...
- Help me up.

01:10:36.105 --> 01:10:38.373
- Aah!
- Come on.

01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:40.141
- Come on.
- (groaning)

01:10:40.143 --> 01:10:41.575
Come on.

01:10:41.577 --> 01:10:43.578
- Let's go.
- I found blood.

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.882
- What?
- When the big guy attacked me.

01:10:49.118 --> 01:10:52.355
(crickets chirping)

01:10:56.459 --> 01:10:57.859
(groaning)

01:10:57.861 --> 01:11:00.564
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God!

01:11:02.165 --> 01:11:03.767
Shit!

01:11:09.639 --> 01:11:11.408
Where the fuck am I?

01:11:13.475 --> 01:11:15.642
Aah!

01:11:15.644 --> 01:11:17.043
Chris?

01:11:17.045 --> 01:11:18.678
(sobbing)
He's fucking dead!

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.516
- Who's dead?
- He's dead! Quinton's dead!

01:11:21.518 --> 01:11:22.850
What are you
talking about?

01:11:22.852 --> 01:11:24.951
He's dead... he's real!
He's fucking real!

01:11:24.953 --> 01:11:26.820
Who is real?

01:11:26.822 --> 01:11:28.856
Chris, who is real?

01:11:28.858 --> 01:11:30.924
The wicked one.

01:11:30.926 --> 01:11:33.628
- No...
- (screaming)

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:35.599
(screaming)

01:11:39.068 --> 01:11:41.071
(screaming)

01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:44.608
(screaming)

01:11:48.144 --> 01:11:50.614
(sobbing, gasping)

01:11:52.849 --> 01:11:56.653
(grunting)

01:12:20.676 --> 01:12:22.043
Something's not right.

01:12:22.045 --> 01:12:24.478
Olivia should've
been back by now.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.580
You're right.

01:12:26.582 --> 01:12:27.981
(sighing)

01:12:27.983 --> 01:12:29.217
Let's get him
back to the house.

01:12:29.219 --> 01:12:30.551
But he's hurt.

01:12:30.553 --> 01:12:31.819
No, he's right.

01:12:31.821 --> 01:12:35.125
- We gotta get...
- (horse neighing)

01:12:37.861 --> 01:12:39.560
(hooves clopping)

01:12:39.562 --> 01:12:41.198
(horse neighing)

01:12:48.104 --> 01:12:49.270
(nickering)

01:12:49.272 --> 01:12:50.838
That's him,
dirty motherfucker...

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.943
that's not good,
go, go...

01:12:56.211 --> 01:12:57.814
(nickering)

01:13:00.183 --> 01:13:01.982
Come on,
you little fucker.

01:13:01.984 --> 01:13:03.853
(sobbing)

01:13:06.788 --> 01:13:07.858
Chris!

01:13:09.658 --> 01:13:11.825
- No-no, Chris!
- Chris!

01:13:11.827 --> 01:13:14.031
Chris, come on,
baby, wake up!

01:13:16.099 --> 01:13:17.798
Trevor!

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.203
No!

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.976
(sobbing)

01:13:55.304 --> 01:13:56.506
Come on!

01:14:09.051 --> 01:14:10.720
(groaning)

01:14:16.792 --> 01:14:18.094
Aah!

01:14:22.665 --> 01:14:24.167
Adam!

01:14:35.877 --> 01:14:37.277
No! No!

01:14:37.279 --> 01:14:39.914
No, please, please, please,
don't, please.

01:14:39.916 --> 01:14:42.149
Alex...

01:14:42.151 --> 01:14:44.688
I'm sorry...

01:14:46.788 --> 01:14:49.158
(silent)

01:14:57.399 --> 01:14:59.767
(sobbing)

01:14:59.769 --> 01:15:01.838
(screaming)

01:15:41.978 --> 01:15:44.344
There's no escaping.

01:15:44.346 --> 01:15:46.713
(panting)
Who is he?

01:15:46.715 --> 01:15:47.815
The devil.

01:15:47.817 --> 01:15:49.283
He's not
the fucking devil.

01:15:49.285 --> 01:15:50.817
Who is he?

01:15:50.819 --> 01:15:53.154
I kept him locked up
for 20 years,

01:15:53.156 --> 01:15:56.158
but now he's back
where he belongs.

01:15:57.426 --> 01:15:59.392
Colin?

01:15:59.394 --> 01:16:01.098
Colin Miller?

01:16:02.197 --> 01:16:03.866
No...

01:16:08.970 --> 01:16:12.440
(panting, gasping)

01:16:12.442 --> 01:16:14.008
Fuck you!

01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:15.779
You son of a bitch!

01:16:20.183 --> 01:16:24.819
No... no...

01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:26.689
No!

01:16:28.491 --> 01:16:30.257
No... no, no...

01:16:30.259 --> 01:16:33.326
No... no...

01:16:33.328 --> 01:16:35.463
No...

01:16:35.465 --> 01:16:37.701
No, don't!

01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:43.206
God!

01:16:47.477 --> 01:16:50.009
Why don't you
just do it?

01:16:50.011 --> 01:16:51.945
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

01:16:51.947 --> 01:16:54.785
Kill me...
just fucking kill me.

01:16:56.952 --> 01:16:58.319
You're pathetic.

01:16:58.321 --> 01:17:00.924
You're a big fucking
pathetic freak.

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:04.895
You don't have the guts.

01:17:06.194 --> 01:17:07.494
Do it.

01:17:07.496 --> 01:17:10.132
Just fucking do it.

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:16.169
Adam.

01:17:16.171 --> 01:17:17.973
Kill this,
motherfucker.

01:17:25.348 --> 01:17:27.248
Oh, God, I thought
you were dead.

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:29.352
Halfway.

01:17:31.554 --> 01:17:33.190
Ow...

01:17:34.422 --> 01:17:36.827
- Come on.
- Get me out of here.

01:17:40.062 --> 01:17:41.995
Come on, come on.

01:17:41.997 --> 01:17:43.864
Come on...

01:17:43.866 --> 01:17:45.231
(whimpering)

01:17:45.233 --> 01:17:47.066
Alex... honey?

01:17:47.068 --> 01:17:48.835
We've gotta go.

01:17:48.837 --> 01:17:50.337
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

01:17:50.339 --> 01:17:52.209
Okay,
let me help you.

01:18:12.461 --> 01:18:14.360
Come on, honey.

01:18:14.362 --> 01:18:16.532
(gasping)

01:18:18.968 --> 01:18:19.999
(sobbing)
