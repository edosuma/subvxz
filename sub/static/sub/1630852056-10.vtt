WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:03.066
You were involved in an
intimate relationship with him.

00:03.133 --> 00:04.100
Yes, ma'am.

00:04.166 --> 00:05.600
He was seeing other people?

00:07.367 --> 00:08.600
And in what year was that?

00:08.667 --> 00:09.600
Pick one.

00:10.934 --> 00:13.100
Just from one gal to another,

00:14.033 --> 00:14.900
don't be foolish.

00:15.934 --> 00:17.066
[whispering] Not worth it.

00:17.633 --> 00:19.934
[narrator] <i>This is </i>Judy Justice.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.900
[theme music plays]

00:37.200 --> 00:41.100
Carla Doshas is suing her
former boyfriend David Murphree

00:41.166 --> 00:42.734
for an unpaid loan.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.734
[Kevin] Court come to order.
All rise.

00:46.567 --> 00:49.000
Morning, Judge.
We have case 1021.

00:49.066 --> 00:51.500
-Doshas vs. Murphree.
-Thank you.

00:51.867 --> 00:53.300
Be seated please.

00:53.367 --> 00:55.333
Miss Doshas, what do you do for a living?

00:55.400 --> 00:58.400
I'm an accounts receivable supervisor
for an autistic center.

00:58.467 --> 01:01.066
[Judy] And how long have you been
employed at the same company?

01:01.133 --> 01:02.867
I've been employed there for three years.

01:02.934 --> 01:05.100
Prior to that,
I was self-employed for twenty.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.600
Self-employed doing what?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.166
I had a medical billing company.

01:08.233 --> 01:09.533
What happened to that company?

01:09.600 --> 01:11.934
Uh, my husband passed away and

01:12.000 --> 01:14.867
one of my clients didn't pay me
for a really long time.

01:14.934 --> 01:18.033
And so I had to re-enter the workforce
to make sure that my child and I

01:18.100 --> 01:19.500
would have insurance and what not.

01:19.567 --> 01:21.867
-And that was three years ago?
-My husband passed away seven years ago

01:21.934 --> 01:24.967
but yes, um, three years ago,
I entered the workforce again.

01:25.033 --> 01:27.133
[Judy]
When did you meet Mr. Murphree?

01:27.200 --> 01:28.667
[Carla]
I went to high school with Mr. Murphy.

01:28.734 --> 01:30.333
-[Judy] And you reconnected?
-[Carla] Yes, ma'am.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.867
[Judy]
In what year did you reconnect?

01:31.934 --> 01:33.066
In 2016.

01:33.133 --> 01:35.533
Was it a business relationship
that you had

01:35.600 --> 01:37.767
that turned into
a social relationship?

01:37.834 --> 01:40.300
No, it was the opposite.
It was a social relationship

01:40.367 --> 01:43.100
that turned into
a business-slash-relationship.

01:43.166 --> 01:44.767
[Judy]
And what kind of business was it?

01:44.834 --> 01:49.266
Originally, we had started flipping houses
and we flipped one and then it went south,

01:49.333 --> 01:51.767
so that was the intent,
was flipping the house.

01:51.834 --> 01:53.000
[Judy]
Okay. And in what year was that?

01:53.066 --> 01:56.433
That was 2016-17. And subsequently,
the house that we flipped

01:56.500 --> 01:58.967
sold in '18, so it was a long,
drawn-out process.

01:59.033 --> 02:00.767
[Judy]
And what did you buy the house for?

02:00.834 --> 02:02.066
-To flip.
-[Judy] I know, but--

02:02.133 --> 02:05.200
-Monetarily, uh, it was $163,000.

02:05.266 --> 02:08.166
And who was going to do the work on
the house? Would that be the defendant?

02:08.233 --> 02:10.333
[Carla]
It was both of us, in actuality, yes.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.800
[Judy]
Who put in the cash to...?

02:11.867 --> 02:14.233
-I did.
-[Judy] To do the renovation?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.567
-You did. How much?
-Mm-hmm.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.333
163.

02:17.834 --> 02:19.100
-So there was no mortgage?
-No.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.600
[Judy]
And what did the house sell for?

02:20.667 --> 02:22.100
257.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.333
Oh, so you made a little money.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.467
With the exception of
what we put into it, yes.

02:25.533 --> 02:27.100
[Judy] Mm-hmm.
How much did you put into it?

02:27.166 --> 02:30.767
In materials and supplies,
about $30,000.

02:30.834 --> 02:37.300
Okay. Paid 163... put in 30, 193.
You sold it for 257.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.934
So you cleared $64,000.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.867
With the exception of having to pay him.

02:41.934 --> 02:45.533
-That didn't include what I paid him.
-Okay. Tell me what you paid him.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.333
I paid him draws along the way.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.266
How much?

02:49.333 --> 02:50.467
Probably around...

02:50.533 --> 02:53.700
-[Judy] Then you don't know the answer.
-Okay. About 7,000.

02:53.767 --> 02:58.066
How much were you paid just in
addition to materials to do the work?

02:58.133 --> 03:00.767
I was paid a total of $17,000 for labor.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.867
But that was not the agreement.

03:02.934 --> 03:07.033
-But you were paid $17,000 for labor?
-Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

03:07.100 --> 03:10.200
[Judy] So that leaves after
she paid for materials,

03:10.266 --> 03:13.900
and your labor, there was $47,000 left?

03:13.967 --> 03:16.934
There was an additional payment
to Mr. Murphree

03:17.000 --> 03:20.133
before the house sold,
of $9,000.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.033
Um, in addition to what
I previously paid him.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.967
He agreed to finish the house.

03:25.033 --> 03:26.467
The house wasn't finished before it sold.

03:26.533 --> 03:28.667
He agreed to do the work,
he never did the work.

03:28.734 --> 03:31.367
I shelled out nine grand
and he bailed, so...

03:31.433 --> 03:35.700
Okay. I'm just trying to get to
a net-net figure in this case, because

03:35.767 --> 03:39.600
it is pertinent, because
you allege a loan to him

03:39.667 --> 03:44.700
and he's got some cockamamie excuse,
which I will get to in a minute,

03:44.767 --> 03:47.467
but so far, have $47,000.

03:47.533 --> 03:49.600
Now, do you acknowledge,
Mr. Murphree,

03:49.667 --> 03:53.066
that you did not actually complete
the labor on the house

03:53.133 --> 03:55.500
to make it turnkey for
the people that moved in?

03:55.567 --> 03:57.100
The house was turnkey when I left.

03:57.166 --> 03:58.533
-[Judy] When you left?
-Yes, it was.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.667
[Judy]
Okay, so, let us for a moment

04:02.734 --> 04:06.600
assume there was $47,000 in profit.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.700
How are you supposed to split the profit,
Mr. Murphree?

04:09.767 --> 04:12.700
We agreed to a 60-40 split
on the final sale price

04:12.767 --> 04:15.233
-of the total profit.
-[Judy] Who got the 60?

04:15.300 --> 04:16.367
-[David] She did.
-[Judy] And you got 40?

04:16.433 --> 04:18.400
-Yes, ma'am.
-And how much did you receive?

04:18.467 --> 04:20.066
$17,000.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.233
Well, you said that that
was for your labor.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.100
Like she indicated,
she paid me in draws as we went.

04:25.166 --> 04:28.433
And we got to a certain point to where
we couldn't work together anymore.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.800
She cashed me out,
with the verbal agreement--

04:30.867 --> 04:32.000
-[Judy] Okay. Just a second.
-Okay.

04:32.066 --> 04:33.633
Did you ever have a written agreement?

04:33.700 --> 04:35.900
-Yes.
-Can I see the written agreement?

04:35.967 --> 04:36.834
She should have it.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.567
She doesn't need it.
You need it.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.333
Because it's part of your answer.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.700
-Okay, well--
-[Judy] No, she doesn't need it.

04:42.767 --> 04:46.400
What your answer is,
"She did in fact, give me money.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.567
But she owed me money

04:48.633 --> 04:52.700
from an old house that we flipped
that she didn't give me,

04:52.767 --> 04:53.934
so that we're even."

04:54.000 --> 04:56.800
And that's why this was not a loan,
it was payback.

04:56.867 --> 04:59.266
-She doesn't have to prove anything to me.
-[David] Okay.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.467
[Judy] Where's the contract?
You don't have it.

05:01.533 --> 05:04.433
-No, I do not.
-Okie-dokie. That's very good.

05:04.500 --> 05:09.233
Now, some time after this flipped house
went south, or was it before,

05:09.300 --> 05:12.367
that you allege that you
made a loan to him

05:12.433 --> 05:14.567
in the amount of $6,200?

05:14.633 --> 05:18.033
It was after, it was, uh,
March 13th, 2019.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.667
[Judy]
Could you answer this for me?

05:19.734 --> 05:22.734
Why in the world,
if this house went south,

05:22.800 --> 05:25.200
and he didn't do what
he was supposed to do,

05:25.266 --> 05:28.567
why in the world would you give him,
because you say he said he needed

05:28.633 --> 05:31.967
a construction job, and in order
to do the construction job,

05:32.033 --> 05:36.667
needed $6,200,
were you still seeing him socially?

05:36.734 --> 05:39.734
-We were. We were seeing-- Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] Okay! That, you have it.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.233
So, I'm just trying to figure you out.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.700
The guy burned you, in a deal.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.400
And then you started seeing him again.

05:47.467 --> 05:49.734
And after you started seeing him again,

05:49.800 --> 05:55.700
-you loaned him $6,000 in 2019.
-Yes, ma'am.

05:55.767 --> 06:00.266
And you were involved in a social,
intimate relationship with him.

06:00.333 --> 06:04.967
And I gather somehow, you ascertained that
he was seeing other people?

06:05.033 --> 06:05.900
Yes, ma'am.

06:05.967 --> 06:07.400
And in what year was that?

06:07.467 --> 06:08.400
Pick one.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.133
-Pick any year?
-[Carla] Pick any year.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.133
Well, then, that makes you foolish.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.333
It does, absolutely.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.734
-Then that makes you foolish.
-Absolutely.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.367
Okay, so in March 2019,

06:18.433 --> 06:21.967
-you gave him $6,200.
-Yes, ma'am.

06:22.033 --> 06:25.467
Want to tell me why, Mr. Murphree,
she gave you $6,200?

06:25.533 --> 06:28.934
I requested it as a loan for materials
on a project I was starting.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.867
You requested it as a loan?

06:30.934 --> 06:32.033
-Yes, I did.
-[Judy] From her?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.100
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

06:33.166 --> 06:35.233
And what were
the terms of the loan?

06:35.300 --> 06:36.967
To pay back the loan whenever I could,

06:37.033 --> 06:39.066
soon as I got my first draw
from the project.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.400
-And did you get a draw from the project?
-Yes, I did.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.133
-[Judy] Did you pay her back?
-No, I did not.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.000
-[Judy] Why?
-I never intended to pay her back.

06:45.066 --> 06:45.900
Why?

06:45.967 --> 06:48.133
Because she lied about
the sale of the house, the price.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.266
I have it here, what it really sold for.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.000
She lied about it, she withheld funds
that she was supposed to give me.

06:53.066 --> 06:54.667
-And she never did it.
-[Judy] Okay.

06:54.734 --> 06:59.967
She says that she sold the house
for $257,000.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.367
-Not true.
-[Judy] Okay.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.166
What's the address of the house?

07:03.233 --> 07:04.266
2204...

07:05.367 --> 07:07.834
May I see that please?
I want to give it to Sarah.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.233
See if she can find it for me.

07:17.934 --> 07:20.066
-Would you do this for me?
-Uh-huh.

07:20.133 --> 07:23.633
Verify this, that this was
the sale price of the house.

07:25.567 --> 07:27.367
And there were taxes taken out,
Your Honor.

07:27.433 --> 07:29.100
There's nothing on the table, madam.

07:31.100 --> 07:35.333
According to Zillow, it did sell
on March 30th, 2018,

07:35.400 --> 07:37.333
for $265,000.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.734
Great. Thank you.

07:40.700 --> 07:45.367
Okay, so Mr. Murphree,
you have two problems, sir.

07:45.433 --> 07:49.400
First, you are absolutely correct,
according to Zillow.

07:49.467 --> 07:55.166
The house sold for $8,000 more than what
she just testified the house sold for.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.333
You're absolutely right.

07:56.400 --> 08:02.300
That would mean, sir, that you would be
entitled to another $3,200.

08:02.367 --> 08:05.467
That's your 40 percent of $8,000.

08:05.533 --> 08:08.066
-Did it have a broker when it sold?
-Yes, ma'am.

08:08.133 --> 08:13.700
Well, if it sold for $265,000,
so the broker also gets a fee.

08:13.767 --> 08:15.233
-Right?
-I understand, yes.

08:15.300 --> 08:20.367
So, the $265,000 was not
a net-net figure to her.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.433
It's-- the house was in her name.
She had pay either

08:23.500 --> 08:25.567
four, five, or six percent
to the broker.

08:25.633 --> 08:26.967
-Right?
-I understand that.

08:27.033 --> 08:29.834
And then, I don't know in what state you
live. What state do you live--?

08:29.900 --> 08:31.266
-California.
-[Judy] California.

08:31.333 --> 08:34.567
In California, they have the system
where you don't need an attorney

08:34.633 --> 08:37.934
to do a closing, the broker does
the closing, so I understand...

08:38.000 --> 08:39.700
and you put money in escrow.

08:39.767 --> 08:43.667
And then there are taxes,
so it's not even $3,200.

08:43.734 --> 08:48.100
At best, maybe it's $2,500 or $2,200.

08:48.166 --> 08:53.700
How do you justify
asking for a loan for $6,200?

08:53.767 --> 08:57.200
With, according to you, no intention
of repaying it?

08:57.266 --> 08:58.867
-Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] Any part of it.

08:58.934 --> 09:02.700
When even if I were to believe your story,

09:02.767 --> 09:05.567
you were only entitled to
a couple of thousand dollars.

09:05.633 --> 09:06.800
What happened to the rest?

09:06.867 --> 09:09.033
Well, she was going to also
assume the role

09:09.100 --> 09:10.567
of the agent for the property,

09:10.633 --> 09:12.600
'cause she had a real estate
license prior.

09:12.667 --> 09:13.834
And we weren't gonna use a broker.

09:13.900 --> 09:16.400
She had another lady
that was gonna do it for a flat rate,

09:16.467 --> 09:18.233
of like, $2,000, like assist-to-sell.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.066
And instead,
after I signed off on the property,

09:21.133 --> 09:22.533
she went and got a broker and an agent.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.900
So she upped the fees.

09:23.967 --> 09:25.767
-Another six or seven, I don't know.
-Just a second!

09:25.834 --> 09:27.567
-Just a second. Just a second.
-Yes.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.200
You're making excuses, sir!

09:30.266 --> 09:31.300
Okay.

09:31.367 --> 09:33.800
-You're making excuses.
-Okay.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.767
[theme music plays]

09:36.333 --> 09:38.767
I'm gonna have Whitney read it back.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.500
Just so that we get exactly what you said.

09:41.567 --> 09:44.333
I want you to get to the part for me,
Whitney,

09:44.400 --> 09:47.400
where he said, "Oh, yeah.
I definitely said it was a loan.

09:47.467 --> 09:49.500
But I had no intention of paying it back."

09:49.567 --> 09:51.133
[narrator] <i>And later today...</i>

09:51.200 --> 09:52.600
'Cause they were still friends.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.066
They were talking behind my back.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.667
They were still friends
but not dating?

09:56.633 --> 09:58.233
You're getting upset,
don't get upset.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.266
You'll find out that
very few guys are worth it.

<i>David says he owes her nothing after she</i>

10:25.667 --> 10:28.633
Now, you're making excuses
because you had somebody

10:28.700 --> 10:31.000
who was clearly
very, very fond of you.

10:31.066 --> 10:33.633
Clearly was emotionally involved with you.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.967
And, I mean, certainly
based upon your answer,

10:37.033 --> 10:40.266
she didn't take the breakup
of your relationship well.

10:40.333 --> 10:43.467
However,
what you said to me a moment ago,

10:43.533 --> 10:46.066

10:46.133 --> 10:48.834

I want you to get to the part for me,
Whitney, where he said,

10:52.567 --> 10:57.300
"Oh, yeah, I took the $6,200
and I definitely said it was a loan

10:57.367 --> 10:59.166
and I definitely said..." whatever.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.567
"But I had no intention
of paying it back."

11:09.600 --> 11:11.767
He said, "I never intended to pay it back

11:11.834 --> 11:14.500
because she lied about the sale
of the price of the house.

11:14.567 --> 11:17.900
I have it here what it really sold--
Here, she lied about it

11:17.967 --> 11:20.734
and withheld funds she was supposed
to give me, but she never did."

11:20.800 --> 11:22.767
Then he says he never intended
to pay it back.

11:22.834 --> 11:26.600
[Judy] Okay. Mr. Murphree,
you owe her $6,200.

11:26.667 --> 11:31.266
You can't lie to someone,
you could've sued her... on a contract

11:31.333 --> 11:34.567
and said, "This was our agreement,
you sold it for more."

11:34.633 --> 11:36.467
A judge would've gone through that
paperwork and said,

11:36.533 --> 11:41.533
"Well, you do owe him an additional
$2,000 or $2,200 or whatever.

11:41.600 --> 11:48.400
You elected using the fact that the woman
had strong feelings for you

11:48.467 --> 11:53.200
even after you sort of screwed her over
on a house-flipping deal,

11:53.266 --> 11:56.667
she still came back
and it was an easy patsy.

11:56.734 --> 12:00.667
You owe her $6,200.
Not good moral character.

12:00.734 --> 12:03.233
I just have one comment to you

12:03.300 --> 12:06.934
because this is just from
one gal to another:

12:07.000 --> 12:08.533
Don't be foolish.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.233
You've done a couple of foolish things,
right? This is your daughter.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.633
You would tell her not to do foolish
things.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.033
[whispering]
Not worth it.

12:16.100 --> 12:19.300
Unless he's got something
that I'm really not seeing.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.266
[chuckles] He's not worth it.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.367
You seem like a responsible lady.

12:24.433 --> 12:27.000
And he seems like a bit of a cad.

12:27.066 --> 12:29.333
So, better without him.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.367
We're done here. Thank you.

12:30.433 --> 12:31.800
[Kevin] Court adjourned.

12:32.900 --> 12:35.133
I went, I took him a six--
or a thirty-pack.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.333
He said, "I don't want that.
That's not the kind I want."

12:37.400 --> 12:40.066
This woman has gone by my house,
throwing beer cans on my lawn,

12:40.133 --> 12:42.066
she's come to my house
all hours of the night.

12:42.133 --> 12:43.600
So I put it on his lawn...

12:43.667 --> 12:46.300
Every time that I started a new
relationship, we were not together

12:46.367 --> 12:48.967
and she demolished every single one.

12:49.033 --> 12:49.967
I absolutely did.

12:50.033 --> 12:52.667
Through fake messages
on social media or whatever.

12:52.734 --> 12:53.734
She disrupted every message--

12:53.800 --> 12:55.467
every relationship
I tried to get involved in.

12:55.533 --> 12:58.800
To washing our hands,
no more contact. Absolutely.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.066
I'm yeah-- so done with this.

13:00.133 --> 13:03.066
I've known her for 35 years,
and the last four have been the worst.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.400
I'm thrilled. It's what it needed to be.

13:05.467 --> 13:07.033
And Judge Judy is amazing.

13:07.633 --> 13:10.934
I absolutely understand
your judgment in that last case,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
but what were some of the other foolish
things you were speaking of,

13:15.066 --> 13:15.967
with the plaintiff?

13:16.033 --> 13:18.533
After they broke up, and--
because she found out

13:18.600 --> 13:21.700
that he was seeing other women,
she said, a long-- for a long time.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.734
She didn't get over it well and she...

13:24.800 --> 13:26.934
didn't behave as the woman
that you saw here

13:27.000 --> 13:29.233
and the responsible lady that she was.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.834
So if there's anything that that case
teaches you,

13:32.900 --> 13:37.700
it's at a certain stage,
a leopard doesn't change its spots.

13:37.767 --> 13:40.133
If a guy's a bad guy, he's a bad guy.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.633
If a woman is a bad woman,
she's a bad woman.

13:42.700 --> 13:46.033
And, you know, fool me once,
shame on you,

13:46.100 --> 13:48.266
fool me twice, shame on me.

13:48.934 --> 13:51.967
Case number 1024,
Dyer vs. Cooper.

[narrator] <i>Destiny Dyer</i>
<i>is suing her former friend,</i>

13:56.700 --> 14:00.200
<i>Jessica Cooper, for her share</i>

14:01.300 --> 14:05.233
Miss Dyer, am I correct that
this used to be your boyfriend?

14:05.300 --> 14:07.400
-[Destiny] In high school, yes.
-[Judy] In high school.

14:07.467 --> 14:09.200
And briefly after.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.934
[Judy] And how long
have you known Miss Cooper?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.600
I have known her since 2016.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.433
[Judy]
And that's when you became friends?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.767
-Mm-hmm.
-And was it after that

14:17.834 --> 14:19.633
that you met--
this is your fiancé?

14:19.700 --> 14:21.266
He's my fiancé, yes, ma'am.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.600
[Judy]
When did the two of you meet?

14:22.667 --> 14:23.734
2015.

14:23.800 --> 14:27.000
[Judy] So it was just serendipitous
that you started to date.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.567
But you've known her since before?

14:28.633 --> 14:31.834
No, I know her after.
He introduced me to her.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.633
[Judy]
How did that come about?

14:33.700 --> 14:35.300
Because they were talking behind my back.

14:36.066 --> 14:37.233
What does that mean?

14:37.300 --> 14:38.667
'Cause they were still friends.

14:39.066 --> 14:40.433
They were talking behind my back.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.500
They were still friends
but not dating?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.133
You're getting upset.
Don't get upset.

14:49.734 --> 14:53.133
You'll find out that [chuckling]
very few guys are worth it.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.834
[audience laughing]

14:57.000 --> 14:57.900
[Judy] You know...

14:58.834 --> 15:00.667
See, the problem is, Miss Cooper,

15:00.734 --> 15:02.633
if you still feel that way,

15:02.700 --> 15:04.800
you shouldn't have
planned a vacation with her

15:04.867 --> 15:06.467
'cause that's what this case is about.

15:09.066 --> 15:10.800
Kevin, be a prince.

15:10.867 --> 15:12.667
[audience laughs]

15:12.734 --> 15:13.700
Sorry.

15:15.533 --> 15:20.834
[Judy] Now, Ms. Dyer claims that the two
of you made plans to go to Disneyland.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.734
And it is Ms. Dyer's claim that you
owe her money for that trip.

15:23.800 --> 15:27.300
-The trip was within the last year.
-Yes, ma'am.

15:27.367 --> 15:31.400
[Judy] And based on your reaction
to this whole thing,

15:31.467 --> 15:34.600
I think that that's still
a raw subject for you.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.900
So probably a bad idea
to plan a vacation together.

15:38.967 --> 15:41.133
Who was going on this vacation,
Ms. Dyer?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.367
Myself, my son...

15:43.433 --> 15:45.934
-[Judy] How old is your son?
-My son is nine.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.100
And Jessica, her fiancé Dustin...

15:49.166 --> 15:50.800
-[Judy] He was going, too?
-[Destiny] Mm-hmm.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.033
A bigger mistake.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.400
[audience chuckles]

15:53.467 --> 15:55.600
-Yeah?
-And her two children.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.066
[Judy]
How many days were you going for?

15:57.133 --> 15:58.166
Five.

15:58.233 --> 15:59.266
You had a room?

15:59.333 --> 16:02.700
We had a room.
We had a preferred room...

16:02.767 --> 16:04.533
-You all stayed together?
-All of us.

16:04.600 --> 16:05.567
[Judy] Oh.

16:05.633 --> 16:10.767
So you had one, two, three, four, five,
six people in one room.

16:10.834 --> 16:13.867
-Mm-hmm.
-And you did everything sort of together?

16:13.934 --> 16:15.000
Is that a fair statement?

16:15.066 --> 16:19.533
Now, there's no question either one
of you alleges that this trip

16:19.600 --> 16:22.333
was supposed to be a gift
or a freebie,

16:22.400 --> 16:23.367
or anything else.

16:23.433 --> 16:27.033
I want you to show me proof
of what you paid for.

16:27.100 --> 16:27.934
[Jessica] Okay.

16:32.667 --> 16:36.066
This-- She paid for everything
and I paid her back

16:36.133 --> 16:38.266
through Venmo twice,

16:38.333 --> 16:39.967
-and then I paid all of those things.
-[Judy] Okay.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.767
Well, all of these things
are small expenditures

16:44.834 --> 16:50.934
that are ordinary expenditures
for $35, $115...

16:51.000 --> 16:56.667
How much money can you show me
that you paid on Venmo?

16:56.734 --> 16:57.767
It's right there.

16:57.834 --> 17:04.533
You paid Destiny Dyer $1,379.31.
Okay.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.266
And then there's another one.

17:06.333 --> 17:10.700
So you acknowledge that
she paid you $1,379.31.

17:10.767 --> 17:12.266
She did, she paid me that.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.867
And $600.

17:13.934 --> 17:16.367
I never got a Venmo for $600.

17:16.433 --> 17:18.800
[Judy] On February 20th, 2021.

17:18.867 --> 17:20.500
[Destiny]
I never received that.

17:20.567 --> 17:21.867
[Judy] She says she never got it.

17:21.934 --> 17:24.233
And I have statements to prove that.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.767
[Judy] I'd like to see your statement
from February, 2021.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.600
And you should check with your account.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.834
I don't have with it me because
I closed that account

17:31.900 --> 17:33.567
but I definitely did pay it.

17:33.633 --> 17:35.867
Both of those came out of the PNC account.

17:35.934 --> 17:38.800
She acknowledged she received $1,379.31.

17:38.867 --> 17:43.000
And she's going to show me her Venmo
account that allegedly will not show

17:43.066 --> 17:46.367
-a $600 withdrawal to you.
-Mm-hmm.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.467
Because if it's not on her statement,
then you take it up with Venmo.

17:49.533 --> 17:52.900
-It never went through. Got it?
-So here are my Venmo statements.

17:52.967 --> 17:54.066
[Judy] Okay.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.967
[dramatic music]

17:57.033 --> 17:58.700
Well, you knew you were
coming to court today.

17:58.767 --> 18:01.467
This is not a beach party,
so you bring that statement to court.

18:01.533 --> 18:02.934
The airfare was what?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.900
Their portion was $295.50.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.166
And the baggage fee was $50.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.467
We're not paying for your baggage.

18:08.533 --> 18:11.133
Would you do me a favor?
I don't want you to talk to her.

18:15.867 --> 18:18.433

18:40.400 --> 18:43.133
-Mm-hmm.
-Because if it's not on her statement,

18:43.200 --> 18:44.967
then you take it up with Venmo.
It never went through.

18:45.033 --> 18:47.867
-Got it?
-So here are my Venmo statements.

18:47.934 --> 18:48.900
Okay.

18:56.367 --> 19:01.166
Okay, all it shows is $1,379, so I suggest
you take that up with them.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.834
She could've just not printed that off.

19:02.900 --> 19:07.633
It's possible, but you could've brought
proof that it was on your statement

19:07.700 --> 19:10.100
from Venmo. You get a statement,
I assume, every month.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.967
I do but I closed my PNC account.

19:12.033 --> 19:14.033
That doesn't-- well, you knew
you were coming to court today.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.033
This is not a beach party,
so you bring that statement to court.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.800
Because I assume this is not the first
time that she told you

19:19.867 --> 19:21.600
she didn't get that $600.

19:21.667 --> 19:24.333
-Oh, she told me that, but--
-Okay, well, she told you that.

19:24.400 --> 19:28.000
-So she told you she didn't get that $600.
-She was very rude about it, too.

19:28.066 --> 19:31.200
She told you she didn't get the $600.
What I'm saying to you,

19:31.266 --> 19:34.300
that that's a bone of contention,
so it would seem to me

19:34.367 --> 19:36.333
that if you knew you were
coming to court today,

19:36.400 --> 19:38.033
-Mm-hmm.
-that's a document that

19:38.100 --> 19:40.333
you would've brought to me.
That "Here is my Venmo account,

19:40.400 --> 19:42.266
it shows that the money was transferred.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.967
I contacted them because she says she
never received it," right?

19:46.033 --> 19:49.000
"And this is the communication."
Not that she was rude to you.

19:49.066 --> 19:51.000
It was because you were upset.

19:51.066 --> 19:55.033
Anyway, that's $600.
So did the $600 make you even?

19:55.100 --> 19:56.066
-No.
-[Judy] Okay.

19:56.133 --> 19:57.934
Now let me put it to you
a different way.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.734
If you had gotten the $600,
would you be in court today?

20:02.300 --> 20:06.333
Yes, because that's still not
the full amount that is owed.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.266
-Okay.
-Your Honor, she also thinks

20:08.333 --> 20:10.467
that she doesn't have to pay
for the car rental, too,

20:10.533 --> 20:11.867
because I'm the one who got it.

20:11.934 --> 20:14.300
-[Judy] Just a second.
-[chuckles] Okay.

20:14.367 --> 20:18.333
Is part of the money
that you claim that she owes you

20:18.400 --> 20:21.500
have to do with the fact
that she rented a car

20:21.567 --> 20:25.400
that you say you're not responsible
for your half of?

20:25.467 --> 20:27.967
-Is that part of this problem?
-No.

20:28.033 --> 20:30.100
[Judy]
Did you deduct half of the car?

20:30.166 --> 20:33.633
I deducted what my total comes out to--

20:33.700 --> 20:35.500
No, no. Answer my question.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.467
Did you deduct half of the car payment?

20:38.533 --> 20:43.834
I did not pay her. I took that off of what
I was asking her to pay me.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.367
Okay. What were you asking her
to pay you? What's the total?

20:46.433 --> 20:49.333
$1,500 is all that I ask
for her to pay me.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.000
-Okay, and you deduct-- Just a second.
-It's been four different amounts. Wow.

20:52.066 --> 20:55.934
So now, we acknowledge that the $600
you didn't receive.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.467
So now she owes you the difference
in that, 900 bucks.

20:59.533 --> 21:03.767
You get the six. The six she actually owes
you, so now you have to show me--

21:03.834 --> 21:05.900
-Yeah. Absolutely.
-$900.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.533
-Okay.
-So I have receipts.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
[Judy] Not receipts.
She has plenty of receipts, too.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.133
-Okay.
-You have to tell me where

21:12.200 --> 21:13.367
that money comes from.

21:13.433 --> 21:15.667
There was hotel, rental car,
and park tickets.

21:15.734 --> 21:18.367
That's what we're talking about here.
And airfare.

21:18.433 --> 21:19.700
How much was the hotel?

21:19.767 --> 21:22.300
So the hotel, including the deposit,

21:22.367 --> 21:28.767
-was $1,514.82.
-$1,514. That's the hotel.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.266
Did you each pay your own airfare?

21:30.333 --> 21:31.467
-No.
-Who paid for the airfare?

21:31.533 --> 21:34.200
-She did.
-Okay. The airfare was what?

21:34.266 --> 21:35.867
The total, or their portion?

21:35.934 --> 21:39.433
-No, their portion.
-Their portion was $295.50.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.266
-$295?
-[Destiny] $295 for the airfare,

21:42.333 --> 21:46.800
and the baggage fee was $50
because I did get a credit back--

21:46.867 --> 21:48.000
Sweetie, we had military.

21:48.066 --> 21:49.800
-[Judy] Now just a second.
-We're not paying for your baggage.

21:49.867 --> 21:51.800
I don't want you to talk to her.

21:51.867 --> 21:53.300
She spoke to me first.

21:53.367 --> 21:55.333
[Judy] Now, the park tickets...

21:55.400 --> 21:56.834
She paid the park tickets.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.700
Okay, how much did she
pay for the park tickets?

21:58.767 --> 22:01.467
That's the Venmo that I received.

22:01.533 --> 22:04.400
-The one I did receive before we left.
-[Judy] Just a second.

22:04.467 --> 22:06.467
Rental car. Your half.

22:07.333 --> 22:08.900
What was her half of the rental car?

22:08.967 --> 22:12.000
That would be 225, half of 450.

22:12.066 --> 22:13.400
[Judy]
And how much were the park tickets?

22:13.467 --> 22:16.066
I've never seen a receipt
for park tickets but I just,

22:16.133 --> 22:17.600
you know, took what she said.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.233
[Judy] Okay, how much
were the park tickets?

22:19.300 --> 22:23.967
Their portion of the park tickets,
which she Venmoed me for,

22:24.033 --> 22:25.900
uh, I think you have my Venmo...

22:25.967 --> 22:27.467
So that was just for the park tickets?

22:27.533 --> 22:29.033
That was just park tickets.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.633
Okay, that was $1,379.

22:31.700 --> 22:32.700
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

22:32.767 --> 22:35.467
So she paid for the park tickets herself.

22:35.533 --> 22:37.767
Her airfare was $295.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.000
Half of the car was $225.

22:40.066 --> 22:43.500
-My numbers come out to 1277.
-Okay.

22:43.567 --> 22:45.900
That's without any of the dining expenses.

22:45.967 --> 22:48.266
I'm not talking about any dining expenses.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.567
That comes up to 1,277.

22:50.633 --> 22:53.166
-But that's how I paid her back, Judge.
-What?

22:53.233 --> 22:56.800
That's how I paid her back.
We would go to dinners even before Disney

22:56.867 --> 23:00.633
and I would pay for her and her son.
We took some dinners.

23:00.700 --> 23:02.367
-I told you I'm not dealing with that.
-I understand that,

23:02.433 --> 23:05.100
-but that's how I paid her back.
-But I told you I'm not dealing with that.

23:05.166 --> 23:09.500
So I'm deducting the $600 that you're
gonna take up with Venmo

23:09.567 --> 23:12.633
because she didn't receive it,
which still leaves a balance

23:12.700 --> 23:15.433
that you owe her of $677.

23:16.767 --> 23:17.934
That's what you owe her.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.467
Period. For you and her family.

23:19.533 --> 23:23.734
Which actually means that you
and your fiancé and two children

23:23.800 --> 23:29.100
went away for 4-5 days,
including park tickets at Disney,

23:29.166 --> 23:32.967
for actually twenty-five, twenty-six
hundred dollars. That's not bad.

23:33.033 --> 23:35.567
All right, judgment for the plaintiff in
the amount for the amount of 677.

23:35.633 --> 23:37.333
-We're done here, thank you.
-[Kevin] Court adjourned.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.533
[Destiny] Thank you.

23:40.166 --> 23:43.066
I presumed that they had a falling-out
as a friendship, which they did,

23:43.133 --> 23:44.767
and that's kinda how
all this sprung about.

23:44.834 --> 23:48.333
The saddest part is losing a best friend.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.000
We did communicate that
we would pay certain things

23:51.066 --> 23:53.567
as we would take her out,
her and her son out to dinner.

23:53.667 --> 23:57.967
I never thought in all the time,
all the trips we've taken,

23:58.033 --> 24:00.367
um... that she would do this.

24:00.433 --> 24:02.867
I think that she knew she could
get money out of the situation.

24:02.934 --> 24:04.000
It's just the money.

24:04.066 --> 24:05.800
Well, it's obviously a very
emotional friendship,

24:05.867 --> 24:07.500
so maybe they shouldn't be
friends anymore.

24:07.567 --> 24:10.367
Clearly, I valued the friendship
much more than she ever did.

24:11.133 --> 24:13.066
If there's any takeaway from that case,

24:13.133 --> 24:17.166
is... it's a social takeaway
rather than a legal takeaway.

24:17.233 --> 24:18.700
Because the rest was math.

24:18.767 --> 24:22.033
It's a very bad idea
to go away on vacation

24:22.100 --> 24:24.600
and stay in the same room

24:24.667 --> 24:26.500
with an ex-anything.

24:26.567 --> 24:29.767
Just the whole thing
sounds very unholy to me.

24:29.834 --> 24:33.967
And... is rife with potential difficulty.

24:34.033 --> 24:35.500
Don't do it.

24:37.133 --> 24:40.567
