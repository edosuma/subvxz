00:32.406 --> 00:36.958
And now, from New York,
<i>The Jerry Langford Show...</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:41.626
with Jerry's guests:
Tony Randall, Richard Dreyfuss...

00:41.792 --> 00:46.639
Rodney Dangerfield, Dr. Joyce Brothers,
Lou Brown and the orchestra...

00:46.797 --> 00:49.471
and little old me, Ed Herlihy.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.978
And now say hello to Jerry!

01:15.784 --> 01:18.958
Thank you. Good evening.
You look like a great audience.

01:19.121 --> 01:23.501
Louis, how are you? Lou Brown and
the marvelous Langford orchestra.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.793
Group.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.673
- Um, Ed, how are you tonight?
- Very well.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.183
Wonderful. I'm sorry I woke you.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.972
I shall adhere to
your request, sir.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.865
You want Jerry's autograph?
Give me the books.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.197
Give me the books,
give me the books. Okay.

01:50.819 --> 01:55.325
- Have him write something personal.
- Half an hour. Goodbye.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.706
I'll give you Mia Farrow for it.

02:01.872 --> 02:05.877
I'm not gonna give you anything else. I'm
not wasting my time going in to get it.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.466
- Hi, Rupert.
- Hello, Rupert.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.068
- Who'd you get?
- Nobody.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.887
I got Rodney Dangerfield.
I'll trade for Barbra.

02:13.050 --> 02:16.350
- You're wasting your time.
- Robin Williams.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.684
Sidney, it's not my whole life.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.396
That supposed to mean
it's my whole life?

02:21.558 --> 02:25.563
It's not my whole life. It's not my whole
life, that's right. It's yours, but not mine.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.842
Jerry, it's me! I love you!

02:53.090 --> 02:56.845
Don't go, Jerry! No! No!

03:03.892 --> 03:07.442
Will you stop shoving, please?
Will you stop pushing?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.036
I'm not gonna take this, Jerry! No!

05:48.056 --> 05:49.558
Jerry! Jerry!

05:51.726 --> 05:53.228
Please.

06:00.944 --> 06:06.496
Okay! Stand back! Stand back!
Please let Mr. Langford get some air!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.293
Didn't you get my message?

06:27.304 --> 06:28.556
Come on, people.

06:28.722 --> 06:33.444
Jerry, I'm sorry. I don't mean to disturb
you. I just wanna talk to you for a minute.

06:33.602 --> 06:36.321
- This is not the time.
- If we could just drive away.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.698
You can drop me off anywhere.

06:38.857 --> 06:42.202
No, I have a very strict rule
about people getting in the car.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.086
I hate to bring this up, and
I don't mean to be rude,

06:45.112 --> 06:47.232
but I did put myself
on the line for you.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.744
- Go ahead, Harvey. Hit it.
- Jerry! Jerry!

06:58.126 --> 07:00.003
Here.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.172
Thanks.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.433
- Is that your initials?
- Yeah.

07:07.093 --> 07:10.222
I just wanna tell you,
my name is Rupert Pupkin.

07:10.388 --> 07:14.438
I know the name doesn't mean very much to
you, but it means an awful lot to me, and...

07:17.729 --> 07:20.482
- Calm down. Take your time.
- I'm a little nervous.

07:21.399 --> 07:26.405
You might have wondered who I am.
I've been outside your show many times.

07:26.571 --> 07:31.828
I'm in communications now, but the point I'm
trying to make is, by nature I'm a comedian.

07:31.993 --> 07:37.250
You're gonna say, "Not another one." But,
believe me, I'm very good. I'm dynamite.

07:37.415 --> 07:41.420
I wouldn't take one minute of your time
if I wasn't convinced I'm dynamite.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.716
You're probably wondering, "if he's so
good, how come he hasn't caught my act?"

07:45.882 --> 07:49.728
That's a very good question, and
I'll tell you why. You know why?

07:49.886 --> 07:55.518
I've been biding my time, slowly and
carefully, so that when my big break came...

07:55.684 --> 07:59.063
Like the night when Jack Paar
got sick? Your big break?

07:59.229 --> 08:02.574
That was the night that convinced
me I wanted to be a comedian.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.201
I walked out of that show
like I was in a dream.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.580
After that, I caught all your
guest appearances on Sullivan.

08:08.738 --> 08:13.209
I studied everything you did. The way you
built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.588
How you delivered the jokes
without leaning too much on them.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.420
How you didn't say, "Hey,
folks, here's the punch line."

08:19.582 --> 08:21.926
You know, Jerry?
You know what I'm talking about?

08:22.085 --> 08:25.931
You don't say, "Folks, here's the punch
line." You just do the punch line.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.592
Exactly. That's what I loved
about what you did.

08:28.758 --> 08:32.261
So, what I'm trying to say is that,
you see, now I'm ready.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.773
I'm ready, and I've
finished the course.

08:34.931 --> 08:40.107
And I'm thinking as I'm sitting here now,
maybe this is my big break, my big chance.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.692
You know what I mean?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.738
What do you think?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.657
- What'd you say your name was?
- Rupert Pupkin.

08:51.823 --> 08:55.293
All right, look, pal.
Gotta tell you...

08:55.452 --> 08:58.572
this is a crazy business, but it's
not unlike any other business.

08:58.598 --> 08:59.732
There are ground rules.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.628
You don't just walk on to a
network show without experience.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.696
It's an old hackneyed expression,

09:05.722 --> 09:08.949
but it's the truth: you've
got to start at the bottom.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.765
- That's where I am, at the bottom.
- That's a perfect place to start.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.350
I know that,
but there's gotta be a...

09:15.513 --> 09:20.314
Ah, it looks so simple to the viewer at
home, those things that come so easily...

09:20.477 --> 09:24.448
that are so relaxed and look like it's a
matter of just taking another breath.

09:24.606 --> 09:28.736
It takes years and years and years
of honing that and working it and...

09:28.902 --> 09:32.998
There's only one problem. I don't mean
to interrupt you. I'm 34 years old.

09:33.156 --> 09:36.122
That's why I'm asking
you if you'll listen to

09:36.148 --> 09:38.984
my act and tell me what
you think about it.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.464
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you call my office?

09:41.623 --> 09:45.799
- All right, okay. I could do that.
- You ask for Cathy Long. She's my secretary.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.179
- And we'll make time to listen to you.
- Uh...

09:49.464 --> 09:52.343
You know how many times I've had
this conversation in my head?

09:52.509 --> 09:55.604
- Did it always turn out this way?
- Yeah, it did, heh.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.688
I really believe this.

09:57.714 --> 10:00.925
I think once you get over the initial
shyness, you're gonna be okay.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.652
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.649
- I hope it works out for you.
- Thanks, Jerry. Thanks a lot.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.864
It's a pleasure meeting you, Jerry.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.369
Jerry?

10:11.528 --> 10:14.347
I'm short on cash, but if you
don't mind just appetizers,

10:14.373 --> 10:16.024
I'll take you to dinner sometime.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.787
I got people waiting. I don't know
what my schedule is. Maybe we can.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.375
Thanks, Jerry, thanks.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.040
Jerry! Jerry.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.755
Let me show you a picture
of my pride and joy.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.214
- That's good. It is.
- That's good, isn't it?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.133
Hey, Jerry, take it.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.683
Take it. Go ahead. Take it.
Consider it a gift. It'll work for you.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.392
- I will.
- Not that you need the help, heh.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.904
Jerry. Seriously,
you ever want lunch, my treat.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.949
- Call my office.
- Okay, okay, okay.

10:50.108 --> 10:53.237
Okay. Jerry, you're a prince.

11:06.749 --> 11:11.880
Hey, Rupe, before I forget, I really
appreciate you meeting me for lunch.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.970
I know how busy you are
and how tired you are.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.353
What are friends for, Jerry?

11:21.598 --> 11:24.067
You're the one who looks tired.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.694
Yeah, I know. It's the show.

11:28.438 --> 11:32.693
The pressure, the ratings,
the same guests, same questions.

11:34.944 --> 11:39.324
- I'm just not enjoying it anymore.
- That's... the worst.

11:42.368 --> 11:47.420
Listen, I really wish you would
think about it again, okay?

11:47.582 --> 11:50.426
You're starting again.
You're starting up again.

11:50.585 --> 11:54.306
- It's not that big a deal to think.
- I am thinking. I'm thinking.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.967
That's all I do, is
think day and night.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.852
How can I not think about it?
I'm here at lunch with you...

12:00.011 --> 12:02.685
which I knew was the reason
you invited me...

12:02.847 --> 12:05.942
and all I'm sitting here for
is to get guilty with you, right?

12:06.100 --> 12:10.526
I'm asking you to take over the show
for six weeks. I mean, what's six weeks?

12:10.688 --> 12:15.489
Anything, but don't ask me to do six weeks.
I can't take over the show for six weeks.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.155
I can't even take over
my own life for six weeks.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.120
And you're asking me to do
something that's impossible!

12:21.282 --> 12:23.660
- It's impossible.
- Rupert!

12:23.826 --> 12:27.000
- What?
- What are you doing down there so late?

12:27.163 --> 12:29.668
It's impossible!
I'm trying to tell you that.

12:29.694 --> 12:32.035
You want the tears to
come out of my eyes?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.843
There's gotta be a way you can
work it out. It's just six weeks.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.179
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Pupkin?
Do you think you could...?

12:39.342 --> 12:40.343
Yeah.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.309
- Sure. What's your name, dear?
- Dolores.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.940
Dolores? That was my father's name.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.438
"To Dolores, who sensed greatness."

12:53.189 --> 12:55.487
There you go, sweetheart.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.324
- Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.
- Don't mention it.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.036
Rupert! Rupert,
who are you talking to?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.041
- Mom!
- What is it?

13:04.200 --> 13:07.545
Please stop calling me!

13:12.542 --> 13:16.888
It's terrific. It's great.
There's only one problem, though.

13:17.046 --> 13:20.391
- He made you bigger.
- Will you give me an answer?

13:20.550 --> 13:23.554
All right, you got the six weeks.
I'll give you the six weeks.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.475
Don't bother me. I'll give you six weeks.
What can I say? Are you happy now?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.608
You're a tough man, Rupe.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.861
You gotta be in this business.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.656
- Hello.
<i>- Hello. It's Masha, Jerry.</i>

14:17.815 --> 14:19.613
<i>- Did you get my note?</i>
- Who is this?

14:19.776 --> 14:23.246
<i>It's Masha. Did you get the note?
I left it on the back seat.</i>

14:23.404 --> 14:26.283
<i>I dropped it there before
they dragged me out of the car.</i>

14:26.449 --> 14:29.953
<i>Those guys really hurt me. I think
that was a bit much. I really do.</i>

14:30.119 --> 14:33.339
- How did you get this number?
<i>- Don't be angry with me, Jerry.</i>

14:33.498 --> 14:37.378
- I said, how did you get this number?
<i>- I didn't know what else to do.</i>

15:17.792 --> 15:19.840
How have you been, Rita?

15:21.629 --> 15:24.758
- Do I know you?
- I think you might.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.890
Rupert.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.525
- Rupert Pupkin, right?
- Right.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.355
I brought you a little present.

15:39.605 --> 15:43.610
Oh, yeah. I remember.
Mr. Romance, heh.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.531
Put an aspirin in that.
It'll last longer.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.126
So, what are you up to these days?

15:53.494 --> 15:56.338
You're looking as
beautiful as ever, Rita.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.876
Well, here I am.
Local cheerleader makes good.

16:00.042 --> 16:04.673
You know, it's funny, but I...
I, uh, voted for you, Most Beautiful.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.099
Did you? That was sweet.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.960
I didn't have the nerve
to tell you then, but...

16:09.093 --> 16:12.063
Yeah, now you can tell me.
It's okay, we're both adults.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.025
When you're younger, you're
afraid to say those things...

16:16.184 --> 16:18.482
but when you get older,
15-, 20 years later...

16:18.644 --> 16:22.148
you can say all those things that you
should have said 15-, 20 years ago.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.195
Isn't that the final
irony of life? Isn't it?

16:26.861 --> 16:28.909
I guess.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.285
Are you happy in this place, Rita?

16:35.870 --> 16:38.419
- Why? You got something better?
- Maybe.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.801
- Oh, really? Like what?
- Well, what are you doing tonight?

16:41.959 --> 16:44.758
- What am I doing tonight?
- Yeah. What's so funny?

16:46.130 --> 16:50.226
It only took you 15 years to ask me for a
date. Don't you think it's a little late?

16:52.261 --> 16:54.935
Really? Well...

16:55.932 --> 16:58.776
Waiter? Can I have a fresh one?

16:59.769 --> 17:01.066
Rita.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.947
Who is your favorite movie star?

17:04.357 --> 17:08.828
This some kind of a game? You gonna tell me
something about my character, my future?

17:08.986 --> 17:13.833
You'll see. Tell me. Everybody
has a favorite movie star.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.994
Well, I better come up with somebody
or we'll never get out of here, right?

17:18.788 --> 17:22.667
- That's a little test, heh.
- Let's see. Marilyn Monroe.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.179
Perfect.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.398
Talent register, huh?

17:41.936 --> 17:42.983
That's her name.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.991
She signed this when she was in New York
on her publicity tour for <i>The Misfits.</i>

17:47.149 --> 17:49.322
- That was her last movie, you know.
- Yeah?

17:50.528 --> 17:54.829
She wasn't a great actress, but she
did have a real gift for comedy.

17:54.991 --> 17:59.041
She died tragically alone, like many
of the world's most beautiful women.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.956
I don't wanna see that
happening to you.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.342
- Who's this?
- Burt Reynolds.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.473
- This?
- Mel Brooks.

18:11.632 --> 18:15.512
He's what you call "on" funny.
Others are just regular.

18:15.678 --> 18:19.524
That's Sid Caesar. He's remarkable.
I really like him. He's great.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.276
Woody Allen. He's a
personal friend of mine.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.780
- Of course he is.
- Ha, ha. No, he is.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.822
That's Ernie Kovacs.
He was wonderful.

18:29.984 --> 18:34.285
He was a great comedian, a great
innovator, and it was a great, great loss.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.575
Oh, I bet some of these
are worth money.

18:36.741 --> 18:40.541
Oh, yeah. Especially this one.
Just hold it.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.094
- Who's this?
- Well, just take a guess.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.723
- Heh, it looks like a retard wrote this.
- Ha-ha-ha.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.556
The more scribbled the name,
the bigger the fame.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.431
That might be true,
Rupert, but who is it?

18:59.597 --> 19:02.066
"R" is the first letter.

19:02.224 --> 19:06.149
- Come on, Rupert. Who is it? I'm tired.
- Well, I'll give you a little hint.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.527
- R...?
- Robert Redford.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.321
No.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.245
No, no.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.906
That's Rupert Pupkin.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.585
Rupert Pupkin.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.669
I surprised you, didn't I?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.096
Take this as a gift.

19:34.757 --> 19:38.603
Take good care of that. In a few
weeks, everyone's gonna want one.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.638
Rupert, you have not changed.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.935
Just a couple of hours ago, do you
know who I was talking to? Guess.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.939
- Your shrink?
- Heh, that's very funny.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.780
No. Jerry Langford.
That's right. The Jerry Langford.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.785
He gave me the go-ahead, Rita.

19:56.112 --> 20:00.618
You know what? Don't tell anyone yet, but
you're looking at the new King of Comedy.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.750
Why not me? Why not?

20:04.912 --> 20:07.916
A guy can get anything he wants,
as long as he pays the price.

20:08.082 --> 20:11.803
What's so funny about that? I mean,
crazier things have happened.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.635
You don't understand
what a shot on Langford means.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.891
That's coast-to-coast
national TV...

20:17.049 --> 20:20.895
a bigger audience than the greatest
comedians played to in a whole lifetime.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.306
A shot at a free ticket
on the comedy circuit.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.477
A comedy show of my own.
<i>The Rupert Pupkin</i> Show. Everything.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.112
All that leads in one
direction: Hollywood.

20:30.271 --> 20:33.775
A beach house in Malibu on the ocean.
And we'll keep a suite at the Sherry.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.821
Everybody stays there when they make it big.
Up top, so we can look down and yell:

20:37.987 --> 20:41.491
"Hey, tough luck, suckers!
Better luck next time."

20:41.657 --> 20:43.500
Come on. What do you say?

20:43.659 --> 20:47.004
It sounds wonderful, Rupert,
and I wish you the best of luck.

20:47.163 --> 20:50.963
But it's getting late and I'm a
working girl. I gotta go home.

20:51.125 --> 20:55.346
I don't get you.
Here I am offering you a way out.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.633
Rita, every king needs a queen.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.143
I want you to be mine.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.233
This is a nice street.
Nice building.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.860
- Thanks for your jacket, Rupert.
- Oh.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.489
I guess you're entitled
to come up and have some coffee.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.242
Oh, no, I wouldn't
wanna impose, really.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.870
- I know I can be...
- What do you want, Rupert?

21:20.529 --> 21:21.530
What?

21:23.699 --> 21:26.999
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

21:27.161 --> 21:30.711
Rita, you still don't understand?
I love you.

21:30.873 --> 21:35.003
I wanna help change your life,
if you'll just give me a chance.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.840
What if I set something up
between me, you and Jerry?

21:40.007 --> 21:42.886
What if we went out to dinner
one night? What do you think?

21:43.052 --> 21:47.603
You know what's even better? We'll go
to his summer house for a weekend.

21:47.765 --> 21:50.894
- He wouldn't wanna meet me.
- That's not true.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.067
Jerry is a very nice guy.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.780
He's a very, very nice guy,
and we had a terrific meeting.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.681
You shouldn't sell yourself short.

21:59.707 --> 22:02.723
You have too little faith, and
you're a wonderful person.

22:04.406 --> 22:09.879
Why don't you go to sleep
and get a good night's rest, okay?

22:11.163 --> 22:12.836
Okay.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.377
- Good night, Rupert.
- Good night.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.718
Go to sleep right away.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.360
I'll tell you, boy.

22:33.435 --> 22:36.109
Hi, Liza. Good seeing you.

22:36.272 --> 22:39.902
Jerry, good seeing you.
Jerry. Don't get up.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.287
Ah, oh, boy, I'll tell you.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.573
Every time you come
back from a tour...

22:45.739 --> 22:49.118
there must be something in the air
or the tour, it really becomes you.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.959
It's like you become rejuvenated.
I don't know what it is.

22:52.121 --> 22:55.091
Isn't that so, everybody?
Isn't that so?

22:55.249 --> 22:59.174
Heh, that's the truth. I'll tell you.
It's amazing. You look wonderful.

22:59.336 --> 23:04.137
Yeah, I know. You look wonderful too,
Jerry. I wasn't leaving you out, heh.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.140
What? Yeah!

23:14.476 --> 23:18.106
Oh, Jerry. I love this guy. Always
coming up with these great lines.

23:18.272 --> 23:21.776
I love him. I love him.
He's wonderful. You're wonderful.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.286
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

23:24.445 --> 23:29.417
Rupert! The bus is here.
It's early. Try to be on time for once!

23:30.326 --> 23:33.830
I can't believe this. Ha, ha, I gotta
go now. Yeah, I gotta catch a bus.

23:33.996 --> 23:38.593
Jerry, take care of yourself.
Baby, be good. Good luck in Rio.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.592
- Good morning, Rupert.
- Good morning.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.603
- How are you?
- This is for you.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.230
Work.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.609
- What time is it?
- It's 10:00.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.942
Is it 10 o'clock? Could I use
the phone for one second?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.151
- Is it local?
- Yeah.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.942
Sure. Just dial 9 first,
and make it short.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.537
Hello. Jerry Langford, please.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.875
Rupert Pupkin.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.965
Thank you.

24:19.375 --> 24:23.346
Yes, uh, is Jerry there, please?
Rupert Pupkin.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.381
Yes.

24:25.839 --> 24:30.185
Well, just tell him it's Rupert calling,
and he'll know what it's about. Thank you.

24:31.762 --> 24:35.892
Oh. Oh, he is? Well, that's okay.
I'm in a meeting myself.

24:36.058 --> 24:41.189
Uh, just tell him I called. Thank you very
much. And I'll call later. Thank you. Bye.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.866
Was that the Jerry Langford?

24:44.566 --> 24:46.989
- I'll see you, Roberta.
- Sure.

24:49.029 --> 24:52.784
Hello. Jerry Langford,
please. Rupert Pupkin.

24:52.950 --> 24:56.921
Yes, Rupert Pupkin calling.
Jerry Langford, please.

24:57.079 --> 24:59.673
Which, the first name
or the second name?

25:00.332 --> 25:05.509
P-U-P-K-I-N. It's often mispronounced
and misspelled, so that's why... Yes.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.926
Jerry knows I'm calling.
He knows what it's about. Sure.

25:11.301 --> 25:15.431
I see, I see. I see.
Yes, you can call me.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.941
I'll be here for the
next hour and a half.

25:18.100 --> 25:24.449
I'm at my office, and
the number is JL5-4321.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.746
I am waiting for a phone call.
It'll only take a few minutes.

25:34.908 --> 25:38.128
- All these phones don't work.
- The phone does not work.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.585
I cannot make a call. I
am expecting a call.

25:40.748 --> 25:44.469
- Let me try. I'll make a call.
- It doesn't work.

25:44.626 --> 25:48.551
Wait. Let me just slide in and make
a call. Let me just make a call.

25:49.465 --> 25:52.969
- It's important.
- This phone don't work either!

26:23.749 --> 26:27.470
I can't do that. Because we're
gonna be working late. Hold on.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.471
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, Jerry Langford, please.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.759
- Your name, please?
- Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.

26:35.135 --> 26:38.184
- Rupert...?
- Pupkin. P-U-P-K-I-N.

26:38.347 --> 26:41.476
People often misspell
it and mispronounce it.

26:44.103 --> 26:49.325
There's a man here by the name of Rupert
Pumpkin who wants to see Mr. Langford.

26:53.654 --> 26:58.831
I'm sorry, Mr. Pumpkin, but Mr. Langford's
secretary has no record of your appointment.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.504
Pardon me?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.711
We have no record of
your appointment.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.878
Oh, well, technically speaking,
I don't have an official appointment...

27:09.044 --> 27:13.015
but he did ask me to call him personally,
and I was in the neighborhood.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.302
I was having trouble
calling for some reason.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.220
The line seemed to be busy.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.061
He has no appointment.

27:21.223 --> 27:24.397
His secretary wants to know
what this is in reference to.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.109
- Mr. Gangemi, go right in.
- Hello?

27:27.271 --> 27:32.493
Yes. Jerry and I discussed my being on the
show last night. He told me to call. Yes.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.071
No, sure, sure. Sure.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.832
I'm supposed to wait.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.905
Is that cork?

28:18.071 --> 28:20.950
I don't know what it is.
Is it dripping on you?

28:21.116 --> 28:23.790
No. I was looking at the patterns.
Uh...

28:25.495 --> 28:28.214
You know, cork is good for sound.

28:29.750 --> 28:30.842
It's very quiet in here.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.796
Reception.

28:34.254 --> 28:37.679
No, you got an hour or so
before they come in. Yeah.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.014
He hasn't come back
from the meeting yet.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.976
- Mr. Pipkin?
- Pupkin.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.641
- Sorry. I'm Cathy Long. Can I help you?
- You are...?

28:45.807 --> 28:49.311
I'm Bert Thomas's assistant.
He's our executive producer.

28:49.478 --> 28:53.324
Oh, I'm sorry. I've already spoken to Jerry
directly about my being on the show.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.112
He told me to get in touch with him
personally. I'm here to follow up on that.

28:57.277 --> 29:00.326
- What is it exactly that you do?
- I stand-up comic.

29:00.489 --> 29:04.164
- Oh. Where are you working now?
- Right now I'm working on new material.

29:04.326 --> 29:08.172
Well, as soon as you do start working
again, why don't you give us a call...

29:08.330 --> 29:10.924
and we'll send someone
to check out your act. Thanks.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.337
- Jerry and I went over this last night.
- Does Jerry know your work?

29:14.503 --> 29:17.256
Yes. I don't think he does.

29:17.631 --> 29:22.011
- Do you have a tape I could listen to?
- A tape? Oh, naturally. Whatever you'd like.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.846
Why don't you drop me by a tape?

29:23.872 --> 29:26.582
I will. I can see where
Jerry would need that.

29:26.723 --> 29:30.444
- Of course. Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.071
This is really what's right.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.324
This is great. This is...

29:36.275 --> 29:39.370
See you again.
Nice talking to you. Bye.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.793
Rupert. Hey, Rupert.

29:52.165 --> 29:55.385
I gotta talk to you. What
happened last night in the car?

29:55.544 --> 29:58.013
- Did he talk about me?
- No, he didn't.

29:58.171 --> 30:02.221
- He talked about me, as a matter of fact.
- He must've said something about me.

30:02.384 --> 30:05.684
What's he gonna say about you after
what you did in the car last night?

30:06.346 --> 30:10.271
- You must be really loving this.
- You were schmucko supremo last night.

30:10.434 --> 30:14.735
Hold on a minute. I'm the schmuck? Me?
You're wrong, buddy. You're very wrong.

30:14.896 --> 30:19.697
If I hadn't gotten in that car, you'd never
even have had the chance to talk to Jerry.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.785
What? I don't wanna be cruel, but
we're in front of Jerry's building.

30:23.947 --> 30:27.793
God forbid he should see me with you.
Jerry and I have a real relationship.

30:27.951 --> 30:33.048
No fantasy world. After what you did last
night, I don't even wanna see you anymore.

30:33.206 --> 30:37.928
Fine! That's the way you want it?
See if I care! Just get it to him.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.108
I'm not giving him anything.
No way.

30:40.134 --> 30:43.083
You're the one who's so friendly.
You give it to him.

30:43.216 --> 30:46.686
We're having a communication problem,
and I need you to get this to him.

30:46.845 --> 30:47.996
Is that what you call it?

30:48.022 --> 30:50.875
You're always bragging about how
you broke bread with Jerry.

30:51.016 --> 30:54.270
Just do this for me, Rupert.
I've done things for you.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.610
You haven't done anything for me.
What are you talking about?

30:57.773 --> 30:59.109
How about Howard Johnson's?

30:59.135 --> 31:02.053
I bought you food. I bought
you coffee night after night.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.038
You got your mind screwed up.
I bought my own coffee.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.620
You never bought anything!

31:07.783 --> 31:10.627
What about things I did for you
that no money can buy?

31:10.786 --> 31:16.293
What about the time I gave you my spot?
I let you get right next to Jerry!

31:16.458 --> 31:21.680
I waited for eight hours and you went right
next to him because you were crying to me!

31:21.838 --> 31:26.639
And what about the time I gave you my last
album of <i>The Best of Jerry?</i> What about that?

31:26.802 --> 31:29.681
I didn't even ask you for money,
and I can't even pay my rent!

31:29.846 --> 31:33.521
What are you talking about? I live in
a hovel! And you live in a townhouse!

31:33.683 --> 31:35.651
I can't believe this girl!

31:35.811 --> 31:37.563
Here, I got money for you.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.548
I can't believe how long
I've been your friend

31:40.574 --> 31:43.511
and listened to your tired,
stale, boring jokes!

31:43.652 --> 31:45.825
- Here's $900.
- Will you be quiet?

31:45.987 --> 31:48.331
Take this and give it to Jerry.

31:48.490 --> 31:51.369
All right, this is the last time.
This is the last time.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.334
- When are you gonna get it to him?
- You're a wacko.

31:54.496 --> 31:58.376
You make sure. I'll know if you don't.
I know where you are, where Jerry is!

31:58.542 --> 32:00.465
I cover the waterfront!
Remember that!

32:01.837 --> 32:05.467
What are you looking at? Beat it!
You scum! You're street trash!

32:20.522 --> 32:25.699
First, Miss Long, thank you for your help at
the office and for passing this on to Jerry.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.159
I appreciate it more than you know.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.315
Jerry, thank you for
listening to this material

32:31.341 --> 32:33.898
and for the opportunity
you've given me.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.335
Lots of people think that guys
like you, people who've made it...

32:37.497 --> 32:40.671
lose their feeling for struggling
young talent such as myself.

32:40.834 --> 32:44.213
But now I know from experience that
those people are just cynics...

32:44.379 --> 32:46.507
embittered by their own failure.

32:46.673 --> 32:51.554
I know, Jerry, that you are as human
as the rest of us, if not more so.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.439
No point in going on about it.
You know how I feel.

32:54.598 --> 32:58.273
So let's get on with the show,
<i>The Best of Rupert Pupkin.</i>

32:58.435 --> 33:02.781
Jerry, I've sketched out this little outline
in order to save you a bit of time.

33:02.939 --> 33:08.241
It's a little introduction. So close
your eyes and imagine it's exactly 6:00.

33:08.403 --> 33:14.081
You're standing in the wings, and we hear
the orchestra strike up your theme song.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.253
<i>And now from New York,
it's The Jerry Langford Show...</i>

33:20.415 --> 33:24.921
<i>with Jerry's guests:
Richard Pryor, Ben Gazzara...</i>

33:25.086 --> 33:27.930
<i>Elizabeth Ashley, Carol Burnett...</i>

33:28.089 --> 33:31.764
And the comedy find of the year,
making his television debut...

33:31.927 --> 33:36.433
- ...Rupert Pupkin, the new King of Comedy!
- Rupert! Rupert!

33:36.598 --> 33:38.942
Are you crazy?
What's the matter with you?

33:39.100 --> 33:42.604
- Come on, Mom!
- People are sleeping. Lower it!

33:46.024 --> 33:48.994
- What's the matter with you?
- Mom!

33:49.152 --> 33:50.394
Take it easy. Lower it.

33:50.420 --> 33:53.227
I'm not gonna lower it!
I have to do this now!

33:53.365 --> 33:56.460
I don't mind you
playing it, but lower it.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.631
Now, you come on, Jerry,
and do your monologue.

34:01.790 --> 34:06.637
When the time comes, this is how I see
you introducing me. Something like this:

34:06.795 --> 34:11.766
"Will you please give your warmest
welcome to the newest King of Comedy...

34:11.925 --> 34:14.178
Rupert Pupkin!"

34:17.597 --> 34:22.103
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.692
I was born in Clifton,
New Jersey...

34:28.858 --> 34:31.110
Is there anyone here from Clifton?

34:35.614 --> 34:38.744
But the fact is that no
one's allowed to be...

34:39.869 --> 34:42.668
Because once you fall
below a certain level...

35:10.025 --> 35:12.904
- Mr. Pipkin.
- Pupkin.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.073
- Pupkin. Sorry.
- You'll get it right one of these days.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.992
- I'll bet you have a tape for me.
- Right here.

35:19.159 --> 35:22.880
Got your name on it? We'll listen to it
and get it back to you as soon as we can.

35:23.038 --> 35:27.214
Thank you very much. When Jerry finds
a moment. Good. When will that be?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.377
Uh...

35:29.544 --> 35:34.345
Actually, you can try me tomorrow. We might
know something by then. Otherwise, Monday.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.350
Monday?

35:36.509 --> 35:41.231
Hmm. Miss Long, what I might do is just wait
here a while. Maybe Jerry'll find a minute.

35:41.389 --> 35:45.314
You're wasting your time. We won't
know until tomorrow at the earliest.

35:45.477 --> 35:49.232
That's all right. I don't mind. I'm not
wasting my time. I'm glad to do it.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.946
It's important to me,
so I really don't mind.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.827
- It'll probably be Monday.
- Monday?

35:57.364 --> 35:59.583
Well, I'll still wait.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.244
Really, I don't mind. It's okay.

36:02.410 --> 36:06.085
I'll tell you what. Why don't you
try me tomorrow afternoon for sure?

36:06.247 --> 36:08.966
- Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
- Mm-hm.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.129
- Four thirty.
- Four thirty. I'll be here. Thank you.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.842
- You're welcome.
- And thank Jerry.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.678
- I will.
- Okay.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.268
Goodbye.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.232
Goodbye.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.618
At least once in his life
every man is a genius.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.950
And, Rupe, it's gonna be more
than once in your life for you.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.866
It's gonna be a number of times,
because you've got it.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.627
From what I've heard here, you've
got it and you're stuck with it.

36:44.786 --> 36:49.383
I don't care if you wanted to get rid of it,
you couldn't. It's always gonna be there.

36:49.541 --> 36:54.513
Now, I know there's no formula for it.
I just don't know how you do it.

36:54.921 --> 36:58.801
And I'm not curious, mind you,
because I wanna use the material.

36:58.967 --> 37:04.815
I'm just curious to know how you do it. I
really have to ask you. How do you do it?

37:04.973 --> 37:07.570
I think it's that I
look at my whole life,

37:07.596 --> 37:10.676
and I see the awful, terrible
things in my life...

37:10.812 --> 37:13.941
and turn it into something funny.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.485
It just happens.

37:16.651 --> 37:19.200
Were the first few
one-liners strong enough?

37:19.362 --> 37:22.806
If they were any stronger,
you'd hurt yourself.

37:22.832 --> 37:25.485
They're marvelous.
Leave them alone.

37:25.618 --> 37:29.168
I remember a man... A man said...
Listen to me. Listen to me.

37:29.330 --> 37:33.585
A man said something very profound some
years ago, which I later originated.

37:34.961 --> 37:39.011
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. You
wanna know how I know it's so good?

37:39.174 --> 37:40.125
Yes.

37:40.151 --> 37:43.955
Because I envy you.
I hate you, but I envy you.

37:44.095 --> 37:48.100
Because it's purity, it's
marvelous, it's humor based on you.

37:48.266 --> 37:52.817
No one else could do it but you. I wouldn't
lie. I wouldn't lie to you, Rupe.

37:52.979 --> 37:58.361
Now, look, this weekend would be a perfect
time for you to come out to the house...

37:58.526 --> 38:02.531
if you care to, and we can hash it around.
Only because I wanna know how you do it.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.995
There'll be people there,
but we can still work.

38:05.158 --> 38:07.707
- It sounds great.
- Terrific.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.997
- I would really like to come.
- Wonderful.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.336
Could I bring somebody?

38:12.499 --> 38:16.345
- A young lady?
- A very special young lady.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.722
Of course. I'd like to meet her.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.896
- Heh, hey, Jerry, how you doing?
- How are you?

38:26.054 --> 38:28.978
- You're looking good.
- You should see me in my white taffeta.

38:30.683 --> 38:34.563
- You're doing some great shows, Jerry.
- Thanks a lot.

38:34.729 --> 38:39.360
- How about putting me on your show?
- Yeah. I could've used you last night.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.717
Come on down!

38:59.504 --> 39:02.053
- Hi, Jerry. How are you?
- Hi there.

39:02.215 --> 39:05.264
Morris, you will not believe
who's coming down here.

39:05.426 --> 39:08.646
Jerry Langford, right?
Morris, please hold on.

39:08.805 --> 39:12.230
Jerry, could you please
sign my magazine for me?

39:12.392 --> 39:16.238
You're just wonderful. I've
watched you your entire career.

39:16.396 --> 39:21.744
Would you say something to my nephew
Morris on the phone? He's in the hospital.

39:21.901 --> 39:25.906
- I'm sorry. I'm late.
- I hope you get cancer!

39:26.072 --> 39:28.074
Jerry?

39:28.241 --> 39:30.369
I can't. I'm late.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.189
Yes, sir? Oh, hi.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.605
- Hi. How are you?
- Not bad.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.365
Good, good. I'm fine.

40:43.942 --> 40:47.196
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like to see Jerry, please.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.364
You are...?

40:49.530 --> 40:51.658
Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.754
Mr. Potkin is here. That's right.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.915
Okay.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.213
She'll be with you in a minute.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.382
- Who's that?
- Miss Long.

41:03.544 --> 41:07.890
Oh, well, I'd prefer to see Jerry.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.143
Miss Long will take care of you.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.554
Okay. I'll wait right here.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.780
And as a surprise to Rupert for being
on the show with us tonight...

41:22.939 --> 41:27.536
we'd like to present to you someone in a
form that we've never presented before.

41:27.694 --> 41:32.074
A mystery guest. Would you please welcome
our mystery guest? Let's hear it for him.

41:42.917 --> 41:45.170
Jerry, this is the mystery guest?

41:45.336 --> 41:47.088
This is the mystery guest.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.217
Let me see if I can place him.
I think I know.

41:50.383 --> 41:53.102
- Don't you remember me?
- No, I don't.

41:53.261 --> 41:56.936
- I'm George Kapp.
- George Kapp. My high-school principal!

41:57.098 --> 41:59.601
- You guessed it.
- Well, how are you?

41:59.767 --> 42:02.847
You used to fail me. What do you have him
on the show for? He's an enemy, heh.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.068
- Only because you deserved it.
- Oh, thank you.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.322
But I'm a justice of the peace now.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.953
- I perform weddings.
- Do you?

42:12.280 --> 42:13.827
Jerry.

42:16.451 --> 42:19.000
Jerry, what are you doing?
I can't believe this.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.210
Believe it.
It's part of the surprise.

42:21.372 --> 42:25.798
How would the audience like to see the King
of Comedy marry his queen on the show?

42:25.960 --> 42:28.713
I can't believe it.
I don't know what to say!

42:28.880 --> 42:31.474
He's too much. He's too much.

43:43.663 --> 43:48.669
Dearly beloved, when Rupert here
was a student at Clifton High School...

43:48.835 --> 43:54.558
none of us... Myself,
his teachers, his classmates.

43:54.715 --> 43:58.219
Dreamt that he would
amount to a hill of beans.

43:58.386 --> 44:02.186
But we were wrong.
And you, Rupert, you were right.

44:03.558 --> 44:08.109
And that's why tonight,
before the entire nation...

44:08.271 --> 44:12.401
we'd like to apologize
to you personally...

44:12.567 --> 44:15.912
and to beg your forgiveness for...

44:16.070 --> 44:18.949
For all the things we did to you.

44:19.365 --> 44:22.869
And we'd like to thank you
personally, all of us...

44:23.035 --> 44:28.087
for the meaning you've
given our lives.

44:29.041 --> 44:33.421
Please accept our warmest wishes,
Rita and Rupert...

44:34.463 --> 44:37.967
for a long and successful
reign together.

44:40.678 --> 44:44.023
We'll be back to marry them
right after this word.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.444
Mr. Pupkin.

44:48.603 --> 44:49.946
- How are you today?
- I'm fine.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.731
Good, good.

44:51.898 --> 44:55.243
I wanna thank you for your tape. We
listened to it with great interest.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.618
Oh, good. I'm glad.

44:56.777 --> 44:59.451
We see a lot of good things
in what you're doing.

44:59.614 --> 45:04.245
We think you have potential, which is why
I'm gonna be absolutely honest with you.

45:04.410 --> 45:07.163
That's the way you should be.
Absolutely honest.

45:07.330 --> 45:10.129
- We don't think you're ready yet.
- Don't think I'm ready.

45:10.291 --> 45:13.511
- We don't feel that you're right for Jerry.
- Right for Jerry. Mm-hm.

45:13.669 --> 45:17.160
Some of the material is good,
but some of the one-liners,

45:17.186 --> 45:19.292
for instance, are not very strong.

45:19.425 --> 45:23.020
They're not very strong. You didn't
like some of the jokes. Is that it?

45:23.179 --> 45:25.648
- That's right.
- Good. I can take care of that.

45:25.806 --> 45:28.357
Just tell me the ones you
don't like, and no problem.

45:28.383 --> 45:30.177
Actually, that's a great help.
Great.

45:31.145 --> 45:34.615
We think you have a good potential.
Your timing is excellent.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.947
But you should keep
developing your act.

45:37.109 --> 45:39.630
You ought to test it in
a few live situations.

45:39.656 --> 45:41.640
I think that'd be
very good for you.

45:41.781 --> 45:44.409
There are a number of
clubs that you can try.

45:44.575 --> 45:49.046
When you start working in one of those,
give us a call. We'll send someone down.

45:49.205 --> 45:51.299
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.

45:51.457 --> 45:53.175
Thank you.

45:54.669 --> 45:58.219
Miss Long, may I ask you a question?
Are you speaking for Jerry?

45:58.381 --> 45:59.678
- Yes, I am.
- You are?

45:59.840 --> 46:04.846
- He has complete faith in our judgment.
- Well, I'm sorry to have to say this.

46:05.012 --> 46:08.016
But I have to tell you, I don't
have faith in your judgment.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.805
I'm sorry that you feel that way.

46:09.831 --> 46:12.337
But I guess there's nothing
we can do about that.

46:12.478 --> 46:15.197
No, I'll have to disagree
with you again, Miss Long.

46:15.356 --> 46:17.450
That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.

46:17.608 --> 46:20.703
Now, would you excuse me?
I have a great many things to do.

46:20.861 --> 46:23.159
Miss Long, when will Jerry be back?

46:23.322 --> 46:26.496
Mr. Langford won't be in
until very late this afternoon.

46:26.659 --> 46:30.163
Mr. Pupkin, we mean what we say
when we thank you for stopping up.

46:30.329 --> 46:34.379
And we mean it when we tell you that
you can call us when you start working.

46:34.542 --> 46:37.341
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

47:01.610 --> 47:04.284
Is there anyone else
you'd like to see?

47:07.033 --> 47:09.127
No. That's all right.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.247
I don't mind waiting.

47:13.998 --> 47:18.094
Which reminds me about the man who waited
so long, he forgot what he was waiting for.

47:20.713 --> 47:23.637
Well, would you mind
waiting outside, Mr. Pupnick?

47:23.799 --> 47:26.222
This is a reception area,
not a waiting room.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.059
I understand.

47:40.566 --> 47:43.445
- Did you ask him to leave?
- Yeah, but he won't go.

47:43.611 --> 47:46.080
- What's his name?
- Rupert Pumpkin.

47:48.908 --> 47:52.958
Hi. I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of
security for the Langford organization.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.464
Why don't we go outside and talk?
Is this your bag?

47:55.623 --> 47:57.796
Yes. I'm waiting for Jerry.
It's personal.

47:57.958 --> 48:01.303
- We'll talk about that outside.
- I know he's expecting me.

48:01.462 --> 48:05.467
Listen, we'll talk about that outside.
Please take your bag.

48:05.633 --> 48:08.978
I'll explain company policy
to you on the way, okay?

48:09.136 --> 48:13.607
Now, I'm pretty sure you understand
that we have certain rules here...

48:13.766 --> 48:19.114
that are essential to the smooth
functioning of our operation. Right?

48:19.271 --> 48:22.445
- If I could just say that...
- Now, just listen, please. Okay?

48:22.608 --> 48:26.954
And that without these rules, we really
wouldn't be able to function at our best.

48:27.113 --> 48:29.332
- You follow my point?
- I get the point, except...

48:29.490 --> 48:31.993
- Please, Mr. Puffer.
- After you.

48:32.159 --> 48:35.663
- After you, sir, please.
- If I could just say that Jerry is...

48:35.830 --> 48:40.301
Just listen to me. I checked with Miss Long.
You do not have an appointment.

48:40.459 --> 48:44.635
Now, company policy is that
only authorized personnel...

48:44.797 --> 48:48.518
and those persons with official
business with our organization...

48:48.676 --> 48:51.520
are permitted on our premises.

48:51.679 --> 48:54.353
In other words, you want me
to leave the building?

49:18.330 --> 49:20.924
- Well? Did you get it to him?
- What?

49:22.543 --> 49:26.639
- Did you get my letter to him?
- He's not in there, okay?

49:26.797 --> 49:30.051
Now that you're so in with him,
you can't do me a favor? Don't bother.

49:30.217 --> 49:32.686
Just give me the letter.
I'll find somebody else.

49:32.845 --> 49:35.394
- He wasn't there.
- I saw him go in myself.

49:35.556 --> 49:37.558
- Who?
- Jerry!

49:37.725 --> 49:40.854
- He's up there right now. Wanna see him?
- That's impossible.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.567
They assured me that he was out.

49:42.730 --> 49:45.028
- And you believed them?
- Mm-hm.

49:45.191 --> 49:48.240
You're so naive.
I would expect that from you.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.700
So inexperienced.
You're such a chump.

49:50.863 --> 49:54.037
- He went up there just now?
- Of course. Go back up.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.919
Assert yourself a little bit.
He's up there right now.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.137
Oh, no.

50:10.674 --> 50:13.302
- Would you tell Jerry I'm here?
- I'm sorry, he's not in.

50:13.469 --> 50:17.064
- I know he is. Would you tell him I'm here?
- I'm sorry, he's not in.

50:17.223 --> 50:20.818
You're putting your job on
the line, lady. You hear me?

50:20.976 --> 50:22.774
Security.

50:23.437 --> 50:25.531
You too.

50:46.585 --> 50:48.838
Mr. Pupkin, what
are you doing here?

50:49.672 --> 50:51.470
Mr. Pupkin?

50:51.882 --> 50:53.725
Mr. Pupkin.

50:54.593 --> 50:56.687
Get security on the telephone.

51:03.102 --> 51:04.729
There he goes.

51:06.647 --> 51:10.277
Hold on. Grab his other arm.
Hold on to him.

51:10.442 --> 51:13.321
Right. All right,
right out the door.

51:14.321 --> 51:16.790
You wouldn't listen, huh?

51:16.949 --> 51:18.166
Jerry? Jerry?

51:18.325 --> 51:20.111
Nobody's gonna help you.

51:20.137 --> 51:22.901
You're gonna have a lot
of explaining to do.

51:23.038 --> 51:26.008
- You had your warning, Krupkin.
- My lawyer'll be calling you.

51:26.166 --> 51:28.885
Make sure he gets my name right.

51:30.087 --> 51:34.467
- Say goodbye to our guest, Miss Long.
- Wait till Jerry hears about this.

51:34.633 --> 51:37.011
I will mention your
name to Jerry, Pupper.

51:37.177 --> 51:43.105
Listen good, because if we see your face
again, we're gonna call the police.

51:43.976 --> 51:48.026
Thank you. Thank you
very much, heh, heh.

51:48.188 --> 51:51.283
Terrific. I suppose
that you got the letter to him?

51:51.442 --> 51:53.570
- No, but I'll get it later.
- Great.

51:53.736 --> 51:57.491
- You just got thrown out of the building.
- I didn't get thrown out.

51:57.656 --> 51:59.374
- What do you call that?
- I didn't.

51:59.533 --> 52:02.002
Excuse me. I wasn't thrown
out of the building.

52:02.161 --> 52:05.711
- You're a constant embarrassment.
- They walked me outside.

52:05.873 --> 52:10.344
- You can't handle the simplest things.
- I'll tell you something else. I'm going...

52:10.502 --> 52:14.132
- Jerry invited me for the weekend.
- Great. I'll go with you.

52:16.717 --> 52:18.014
Do I look okay?

52:18.177 --> 52:20.396
- Wonderful.
- Does this look all right?

52:20.554 --> 52:22.807
- That, I'm not sure about.
- What do you mean?

52:22.973 --> 52:25.396
- You look wonderful.
- What's wrong with it?

52:25.559 --> 52:27.561
Nothing. I just don't
think you need it.

52:27.728 --> 52:31.198
- You don't think it looks nice on me?
- No, it looks wonderful.

52:48.582 --> 52:49.583
Hello.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.969
- You must be Jonno.
- Uh, yes.

52:52.127 --> 52:54.425
My name is Rupert Pupkin
and this is Rita Keane.

52:54.588 --> 52:57.967
- Would you let Jerry know we're here?
- Mr. Langford asked you to come?

52:58.133 --> 53:00.602
No, we just thought we'd drop
in uninvited for the weekend.

53:02.596 --> 53:06.442
Come on in. We'll be staying in
separate rooms. The blue bag is mine.

53:06.600 --> 53:10.571
- But Mr. Langford's not here.
- Where is he? Out playing golf?

53:10.729 --> 53:12.151
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

53:12.314 --> 53:15.659
- I hope he's finally gonna break 100.
- A hundred?

53:15.818 --> 53:19.072
- Perhaps better you come back.
- No, we'll just wait.

53:19.238 --> 53:23.493
- But Mr. Langford is not here.
- That's okay. We'll just wait.

53:23.659 --> 53:25.912
That's okay. We don't mind waiting.

53:26.078 --> 53:28.126
Isn't this lovely?

53:31.583 --> 53:34.086
Table's only set for one.

53:40.259 --> 53:42.808
- How do you like it?
- I could live here.

53:42.970 --> 53:45.814
Mr. Langford, I'm sorry
to disturb you, sir.

53:45.973 --> 53:49.648
Uh, what's wrong? Everything's wrong.
There are a couple over here.

53:49.810 --> 53:55.158
His name is Pumpkin. Pumpkin, yes.
Do you know a name Pumpkin?

53:58.444 --> 54:00.822
Didn't you tell him what
time we'd get here?

54:00.988 --> 54:04.162
We didn't have time to iron out
the details. We're the first guests.

54:04.324 --> 54:06.668
But that butler wasn't
even expecting us.

54:06.827 --> 54:10.832
Jerry does have more important things to
think about than what to tell his houseboy.

54:10.998 --> 54:13.501
Really? Well, excuse me.

54:19.173 --> 54:22.222
He knows everything. He knew you
were playing golf and everything.

54:22.384 --> 54:26.730
Uh, I don't know what he want. He wanna
spend the weekend over here. Yes.

54:26.889 --> 54:31.440
And you better come back. He's touching
everything. He's ruining the house.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.525
And I'm getting a
heart attack already.

54:33.687 --> 54:38.363
Here's a famous one with the youngest clown
in the world, Zippo. Clown for a day.

54:38.525 --> 54:41.699
Remember this one with
Ray Charles on Jerry's special?

54:41.862 --> 54:43.864
- That's famous.
- I know. There it is.

54:44.031 --> 54:46.830
Here's a famous one when he
was a kid, 12 years old.

54:46.992 --> 54:51.372
Someone sent this in as a part of the
show, "I Knew You When" section.

54:51.538 --> 54:56.214
They thought they were playing a joke. Now
Jerry shows it to everyone on the show.

54:58.128 --> 55:02.053
<i>If I should take a notion...</i>

55:02.216 --> 55:05.220
Let's get a little life into this place.
It's like a funeral parlor.

55:05.385 --> 55:07.558
<i>Jump off into the ocean</i>

55:07.721 --> 55:11.726
You should really turn that off. You
shouldn't put that on. It's not polite.

55:11.892 --> 55:15.396
- How about a little spin, handsome?
- We shouldn't be dancing.

55:15.562 --> 55:18.907
- A little fun never hurt anybody.
- What if Jerry walks in?

55:19.066 --> 55:21.990
He'll be happy to see
us having a good time.

55:22.152 --> 55:26.077
- What if he walks in?
- So? You're his friend. He won't mind.

55:26.532 --> 55:30.753
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

55:32.913 --> 55:34.256
<i>Oh, one day...</i>

55:34.414 --> 55:37.354
I wonder what the rest
of this place is like.

55:37.380 --> 55:39.616
Well, I'm sure it's very nice.

55:40.420 --> 55:42.798
No, Rita, I wouldn't go up there.

55:42.965 --> 55:44.592
- Rita? Rita?
- Come on.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.806
I don't think it's a good idea.

55:47.678 --> 55:52.309
Rita, they're watching us. Rita, I don't
think you have the right to go upstairs.

55:52.474 --> 55:54.272
Rita, please don't go up there.

56:03.652 --> 56:07.657
Would you open the goddamn door?
I was standing out there eight minutes.

56:07.823 --> 56:11.168
What was with the door? Jesus!
Where are they?

56:11.326 --> 56:13.795
I was gonna call the police,
but I wait for you.

56:13.954 --> 56:19.757
Hi, Jerry. Hi, Jerry. How are you?
We were just freshening up upstairs.

56:19.918 --> 56:24.845
Rita, I want you to meet the Jerry Langford.
Jerry, I want you to meet the Rita Keane.

56:25.007 --> 56:28.762
Come on down. Don't be ashamed.
Attagirl. Come on down.

56:29.469 --> 56:31.972
What's your pleasure, Jerry?

56:34.725 --> 56:35.960
It's hot out there.

56:35.986 --> 56:40.598
I wanna get something nice to drink.
Jerry, what would you like? Jer?

56:42.566 --> 56:44.284
Jer?

56:45.569 --> 56:50.166
Excuse us, but it's not every day that
a girl like Rita meets a man like you.

56:50.324 --> 56:53.578
I mean, this is part of your success.
You have to live with it.

56:53.744 --> 56:56.998
How was your golf game? Was it good?
Did you finally break 100?

56:57.164 --> 57:00.338
- I told them you were not here.
- That's right, he did.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.878
Yes, they did. They were
really very helpful.

57:03.045 --> 57:06.970
We took an earlier train. There wasn't
anything else until after 1, so...

57:07.132 --> 57:12.184
Anyway, I brought the work. It's right
here. All ready. All ready and set to go.

57:12.679 --> 57:13.976
So...

57:15.432 --> 57:17.230
where is everybody?

57:17.976 --> 57:22.197
- What everybody?
- Heh, what everybody? The guests, Jer.

57:22.356 --> 57:25.109
To tell you the truth,
we're getting a little hungry.

57:25.525 --> 57:27.527
You know I could have the
both of you arrested?

57:29.196 --> 57:32.120
He could have us arrested. Of
course you could have us arrested.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.501
There's no way we can
prove that we belong here.

57:34.660 --> 57:38.005
He's great. When he comes up
with an idea, he's terrific.

57:38.163 --> 57:41.417
- Really, I never thought of that.
- You should have.

57:41.583 --> 57:43.868
We can set up a story
where you invite all your

57:43.894 --> 57:45.988
friends out and you
throw them all in jail!

57:50.050 --> 57:52.553
That's terrific. That's terrific.

57:54.346 --> 57:58.567
What's the matter? Lighten up. Let's get
to work on that. After this, of course.

57:58.725 --> 58:00.568
How did you get here?

58:00.727 --> 58:03.901
We walked in the door. What do you
mean? What's the matter with you?

58:04.064 --> 58:05.862
How did you get here?

58:06.024 --> 58:09.198
I think you're upset.
I'm gonna leave my material here.

58:09.361 --> 58:12.740
We'll talk later. You've got more
important things to worry about.

58:12.906 --> 58:15.551
We'll just stroll around,
wait till lunchtime.

58:15.577 --> 58:18.108
Did anyone ever tell
you you're a moron?

58:19.079 --> 58:21.628
You know, Jerry,
I wanna tell you something.

58:21.790 --> 58:24.794
Ordinarily I wouldn't allow anybody
to speak that way about Rita.

58:24.960 --> 58:28.760
But since it's you, I know you're only
kidding. He's a real character.

58:29.464 --> 58:33.685
- Rupert, he's saying he wants us to go.
- No, he's not saying that.

58:33.844 --> 58:37.565
Jerry, tell her that. You're not saying
that. He's not saying that at all.

58:37.723 --> 58:40.897
- Call the station, Jonno.
- Where are you going? Rita?

58:41.059 --> 58:44.905
There'll be a cab here in five or 10
minutes. Wait at the gate and use it.

58:45.063 --> 58:47.441
Why? You going someplace, heh?

58:47.983 --> 58:49.451
No, you are.

58:50.861 --> 58:56.288
Did I say something wrong, Jerry? Because if
I did, could we chalk it up to inexperience?

58:56.450 --> 58:58.123
Rita?

58:59.286 --> 59:02.460
I have my stuff right here.
We could do it in a half an hour.

59:02.622 --> 59:05.341
Then you'd have the rest of
the afternoon to yourself.

59:05.584 --> 59:10.841
I want you out of here. I want you out
of here now. Is that plain enough?

59:11.006 --> 59:12.508
- I understand.
- Is that clear?

59:12.674 --> 59:16.349
Yeah, yeah. I understand.
Look, you're tired. That's okay.

59:16.511 --> 59:20.266
I'm gonna leave the stuff here. Read
it and let me know what you think.

59:20.432 --> 59:23.732
Don't be so dopey. Use your ears.
The man is telling us to go.

59:23.894 --> 59:25.817
He is not telling us to go.
Will you stop?

59:25.979 --> 59:29.654
- Mr. Langford, I knew nothing about this.
- Tell her she's wrong, Jerry.

59:29.816 --> 59:33.787
I don't even know him. I haven't seen him
in years. He told me you were friends.

59:33.945 --> 59:35.162
Rita!

59:35.322 --> 59:38.952
I feel terrible. I'm so humiliated.
If there's anything I can do...

59:39.117 --> 59:42.041
Don't listen. She works in a bar.
She wants to spoil everything.

59:42.204 --> 59:44.502
Come on, Rupert. Let's go.

59:45.415 --> 59:49.170
- Jerry...
- Okay, come on. Come on, come on.

59:49.336 --> 59:51.509
- Let's go.
- Sorry, Mr. Langford.

59:51.671 --> 59:55.801
- Here you are. Take your things and go!
- All right, I can take a hint, Jerry.

59:55.967 --> 59:59.847
I just want you to listen to my stuff for
15 minutes. Is that asking too much?

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:02.266
Yes, it is. I have a life, okay?

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:05.481
- I have a life too.
- That's not my responsibility.

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:10.195
- It is when you tell me to call you.
- I told you to call to get rid of you!

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:13.201
- To get rid of me? Okay, I can take a hint.
- That's right.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.785
If I didn't tell you that, we'd still
be on the steps at my apartment!

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.791
- All right, so I made a mistake.
- So did Hitler!

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.707
All right. This is the way
it is when you're famous.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.544
- You understand?
- Now I see. That's how you guys are, huh?

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:29.550
- Not them. Me. Yeah!
- That's how you are.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:32.713
- When you reach the top.
- No, I was that way before.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:35.678
- Now I know how people like you are.
- Goodbye and good luck!

01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:37.388
Goodbye.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:41.727
And, Jerry. Jerry, I just wanna
say one more thing, Jerry.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:46.894
I'm glad what you did to me today. Because
now I know I can't rely on anybody.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.610
Not you, not anybody.
And I shouldn't rely on anybody.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:55.073
And you wanna know something else?
I'm gonna work 50 times harder...

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:57.704
and I'm gonna be 50 times
more famous than you.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:00.537
Then you're gonna have idiots
like you plaguing your life!

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:04.875
That's right. Yes. Come on, Rita. We're
wasting our time. Goodbye, Jerry.

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:08.915
Jonno, lock that door.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.970
- You did good, Mr. Langford.
- Thank you.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.102
It looks real.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.225
That's the whole point.

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:35.075
- Is that him?
- No.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:38.453
- You sure?
- Sure, I'm sure. It looks too much like him.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:42.583
- What do you mean?
- When it's him, it doesn't look like him.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.247
God, it feels like it's
taking him forever.

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:52.630
How much longer?

01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:57.551
It's him.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:02.886
Yeah, that's him.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.272
- Don't go too fast.
- Okay, okay.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:11.812
Stay on this side so
you're not all over him.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:15.653
- I'm getting over as soon as I can.
- Get in the next lane.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.909
Okay, okay, okay.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:22.953
- Not yet. There are too many people.
- I know. I'll keep going.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:27.210
He walks in the most crowded areas.
You'd think he'd wanna stay away.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.792
Well, because he doesn't
wanna be alone.

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:34.085
Why? Tell me why.
I know. You tell me why.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.843
Don't get an attitude with me.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:42.054
Explain it to me, because
you know so much about him.

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:44.515
Fill me in. Let me learn from you.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:49.354
All right. Because when he walks on crowded
streets, he feels safe, that's why.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.645
Is that what it is?
Thanks for telling me.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:03.530
Okay, go past him and stop.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:11.501
Okay, Jerry. Get over. Get in
there. I'm not fooling around.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:15.884
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- Get in, Jerry. Get in.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.382
Hi, Jerry.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.602
Take that. She's gonna
hold a gun on your head.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.855
Don't make any false moves.
I'd hate to do anything drastic.

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:34.145
Now, if everything works out, you should be
out of here by the very latest 12-, 12:30.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:38.573
Well, maybe 1-, 1:15
at the very latest.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:42.032
What I want you to do
is call your producer.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.912
- Call what?
- Bert Thomas. I want you to call him.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:47.870
I'm gonna give you
a phone right now.

01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:52.163
Get him on the phone, and I'll tell
you exactly what to say, okay?

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.423
Now, if you don't do it,
I don't know what to say.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.088
There could be a problem.

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:07.645
Watch your eyes, Jerry. I'm gonna take these
off now. It's a little bright in here, okay?

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:24.531
Okay.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.122
Are these yours?

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:34.712
- Jerry, these are yours?
- Yeah.

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:38.918
- Do you mind if I have one?
- I don't mind.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.131
Thank you.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:43.046
- Masha, do you want one?
- Save it for me.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.762
- You want one?
- I'd love one, but will you save it?

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:49.428
It's a little bit inconvenient at
the moment. Thank you, Rupert.

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.313
- Do you want one?
- No.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:54.975
I'll just take one for later then.

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.781
There's no reason to get mad.
I'm just trying to ease the tension.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.988
Even though this is a
strange situation...

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:08.075
there are moments of friendship
and moments of sharing or whatever.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:10.286
Okay, let's go.

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:15.920
Jerry, I mean business.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:20.008
Get on the phone.
Let's go. The fun is over.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:24.879
Let's go. Come on.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.615
Bert Thomas, please.
Jerry Langford.

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:50.830
- What happened?
- They hung up.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.374
Call them again.
Why did they hang up?

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:00.586
Probably thought it was a gag.
We get that all the time.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:03.217
Well, I find that
strange, you know.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:08.348
But it's typical. Because that's
the way they treat even you.

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:10.850
Because I'll let you
in on a little secret.

01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:13.933
That's the way they treated me.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.143
And now look where we are.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:20.564
Bert Thomas.

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:24.231
Audrey, this is Jerry Langford. Get
Bert Thomas on the phone, and quickly.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.401
Martino, I know it's you.
I'm too busy for games today.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.821
Did you hear what I said? This is Jerry
Langford. Now, get Bert Thomas.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:34.787
I'm not kidding. It's not a gag.
It's serious. Now, move it!

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:39.663
- Why don't we have somebody else?
- Like what?

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:42.173
It's Mr. Langford.
He says it's urgent.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.085
Tell him I'll call him back.
I'm busy.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.596
- It's that Martino kid, the impressionist.
- He's a pain in the neck.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:51.884
Will you do what I tell you?
And do it quick.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:56.271
I'm sorry, Mr. Thomas, he insists on
talking to you. I cannot get rid of him.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.431
Okay, I'll take it.

01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.069
Martino, you know better...

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:08.280
Bert, I said this is Jerry. Jerry
Langford. And I'm in deep trouble.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:12.947
- Now you'd best pay attention.
- Yeah, I am listening, uh...

01:07:15.823 --> 01:07:17.621
Would you give me that again?

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:25.083
Now, wait a minute. Uh,
I wanna ask you something.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.757
What do we call our
second cameraman?

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:33.513
We call our second
cameraman Helen Keller.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.807
His favorite color is plaid.

01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:39.643
Helen Keller? Plaid? What is that?

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.309
When someone does
an impression of me on the phone...

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:46.150
the only way they're gonna know
it's really me is by that clue.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:49.782
If I didn't know what we called him,
then he would know it's not me.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.318
Say no more. I understand.

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:55.163
Now, listen, Bert.
Listen carefully.

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.325
"I have a gun...

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:03.337
at my head.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:08.843
If a man who identifies
himself as...

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.676
the King..."

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:21.680
Card's upside down.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.688
Sorry.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:30.490
"...Is not allowed to be
the first guest on..."

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.031
You got a blank card there.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:42.536
Hold on, Bert.
I'm reading from cue cards.

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:49.796
"...tonight's show...

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:55.299
you will never see me..."

01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.553
Go back.

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:03.018
"...alive again."

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:09.404
It's not grammatically correct,
but I think you have the idea.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:13.908
It's clear, but let me break in for a minute.
Let me talk to you. Don't do anything silly.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:16.741
Okay. I'm okay.

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:19.577
I'm okay, Bert. Just get it done.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.375
He wants you to call at 5:00.
I have the private number.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:30.508
- They'll do whatever you want.
- Okay, that was very good, Jerry.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:33.127
Turn around,
let's see how it looks.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:37.925
Oh, I love it. I'm sorry.
The sleeves aren't quite right.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:41.015
Do you like it on him?
What do you think?

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:43.930
I think it looks pretty good.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:48.102
To guess on it and have it turn out
like this, I'm very pleased with it.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:51.645
The color's great, and I like to see
him more casual for a change.

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:56.614
This is a look I like to see on him.
Not so uptight, not so...

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:59.450
- Okay. I gotta get started here.
- What do you think?

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.161
- It's wonderful. It's very good.
- Be honest with me.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:05.122
- I'm being honest.
- Would you wear it?

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:10.290
I like it. I'm so glad I went with red.
It looks so good on him.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.175
- It looks good, Jerry.
- Gorgeous. Mm.

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:14.631
- Come on.
- What?

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:17.422
- Take it off and let's go.
- Oh, okay.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:23.095
You want me to take it off? Why can't
he wear it for a little while?

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:25.309
Will you take it off, please?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:30.102
I know he's in a meeting, but this is
an emergency and I gotta talk to him.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:34.648
You'll interrupt him, or I'm gonna
come busting into that meeting.

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:38.152
No. Forget calling me back.
I'm on my way.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:43.164
Why didn't you listen to the tape when I
asked you to? It wasn't that hard, was it?

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:47.327
A few minutes of your time to listen to
something that I worked on my whole life.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:52.499
If that's what's behind all this, let's go to
my office and we'll play the tape right now.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:56.044
Are you crazy? You know what would
happen to me if I went there now?

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.305
- I'm not stupid.
- Nobody's calling you stupid.

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:01.512
You pulled this off.
That makes you smart.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.848
You know, Jerry,
I'm gonna tell you something.

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.979
Friendship is a two-way street.

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:12.186
You know that? And you couldn't
have cared less about me.

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:16.197
Am I gonna hold this till next Shavuoth?
You gonna make some decisions here?

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:19.655
You gonna knock off
the talking for two minutes?

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:22.070
When you put the sweater on,
was I bothering you, huh?

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.455
It took one minute.
You have a long night ahead.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:27.584
- I have something to say.
- You've got more than enough to say.

01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:32.999
You're driving me nuts. Can you be quiet
for one goddamn minute and let me rest?

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:36.384
With this gun?
You're driving me crazy!

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:39.216
You have not shut up since
we walked into my house.

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:41.551
This is my house.
This is my domain.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:45.344
Jerry is my guest and you're my guest,
and you're lucky to be here!

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:49.356
You get to change in my house, you get
your head together for the show tonight.

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:53.064
Why don't you give me a little break?
Why can't you give me a break? Shut up!

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:57.231
You shut up. I did give you a break.
I listened to you talk about that sweater.

01:11:57.396 --> 01:12:01.071
Worrying about the sleeves,
the color. Did I say anything?

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:04.238
I didn't make it for you. I made it
for Jerry. It looks fabulous.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:08.624
Whose idea was this anyway? If it wasn't
for me, you wouldn't even be here.

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:13.584
Why didn't you listen to the tape when
I asked you to? Was that so hard to do?

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:19.253
I'm sure you can understand, doing the kind
of show I'm doing, it's mind-boggling.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:22.922
There's so much stuff that comes down,
you can't keep your head clear.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.933
And if that's the case, I'm wrong.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.936
You're right, I'm wrong.
If I'm wrong, I apologize.

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:34.435
I'm just a human being, with all of
the foibles and all of the traps.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.571
The show, the pressure, the groupies,
the autograph hounds, the crew.

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:41.949
The incompetents behind the scenes
you think are your friends...

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:45.453
and you're not sure if you're gonna
be there tomorrow because of them.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:50.583
Wonderful pressures that make every day
a glowing, radiant day in your life.

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:55.121
It's terrific. Okay. If all
of that means nothing...

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.916
if I'm wrong,
in spite of all that...

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.301
then I apologize, I'm sorry.

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:06.303
If you accept my apology, I think we should
shake hands and we'll forget the whole thing.

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:12.723
I won't press charges. You two could be in
deep trouble, but I will not press charges.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.940
- Ahh, that's easy for you to say, Jerry.
- But I mean it.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:21.857
I mean, I'll go to the office
and tell them all it's a gag.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:25.402
They'll understand that. If I tell
them it's a gag, they're gonna buy it.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.082
And then we'll put the
tape on and listen...

01:13:28.108 --> 01:13:29.894
Sit down! I said, sit down.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.624
You heard what he said.

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:35.286
Yeah, right. All of a sudden with a
gun on him, he wants to be friends?

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:39.208
- What happens when he walks out the door?
- What happens then, Jerry?

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:43.094
- You get to his office, and they jump you.
- Is that what happens, Jerry?

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:47.344
Not if I tell them not to. They won't
jump you. No one's gonna jump you.

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:52.182
If I tell them to do something,
they do it. No one's gonna jump you.

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:55.519
Now, that's the truth. You
have to take my word for it.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:14:00.027
If you think I'm not telling you
the truth, then don't respond.

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:03.907
If you think I'm telling you the truth,
then let me get the hell out of here.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.534
- He gives me his word.
- And what else?

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.194
And what else, Jerry?

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:13.116
There is nothing else.
Just my word.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:16.243
Isn't my word good enough?

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.707
I'm sorry, Jerry.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:42.146
Suppose we tape him, he doesn't
talk, it gets to be 11:30.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.689
Do we put him on, no matter what?

01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:48.951
You can go ahead and tape him. It, uh, won't
hurt anything. You always can erase it.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:52.740
We may learn something from it
and, uh, it'll also buy us time.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.579
Under no circumstances will
we put this man on the air.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:15:00.372
This lunatic is threatening Jerry's life
and you're not gonna put him on the air?

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:05.795
Let's not get too excited. I don't
think you understand. We'll tape at 7.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.931
We won't have to make a decision about
putting him on the air till 11:30.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:15.596
This gives us four hours. Hopefully, by that
time, we'll have Mr. Langford back safely.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:20.267
Harry, that's it. We're suing. We're going
to sue. We're gonna sue everybody.

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:22.777
- Who is this man?
- Jerry's lawyer.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:26.565
What do you mean, who am I?
I'm the one who's suing. I'm the lawyer.

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:29.154
- Jay...
- Don't "Jay" me, please. Do me a favor.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.614
Jay, who are you going to sue?

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:33.779
You. We're suing you, personally!

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.789
- Who else are you suing?
- The FBI.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:39.248
We have a serious situation and I
want it dealt with rationally.

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:42.914
Unless we start talking politely,
there's gonna be serious consequences.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.777
There is nothing
polite about kidnapping.

01:15:45.803 --> 01:15:48.327
It is one of the most
stupid offenses ever.

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:52.307
Where's the defense of kidnapping?
How can you say "I was crazy"?

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:55.639
"I didn't know what I was doing.
I did it on the spur of the moment"?

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:56.848
Jay, who cares?

01:15:57.011 --> 01:16:01.642
Only an idiot kidnaps. And only an idiot
decides to do what you guys are doing.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:13.778
Jerry, I'm gonna go now.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:19.747
Pretty soon you'll be able to go. About
12-, 12:30, as I said. Have a good time.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:22.290
I know you will, heh.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:23.875
Bye.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.880
First of all, we don't know whether we're
dealing with kidnappers or terrorists.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:34.845
Terrorists? Terrorists?
What do you mean, terrorists?

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:38.477
You might have this man go on the
air, deliver a coded message...

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:41.856
and possibly 50 people around the
country would lose their lives.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:45.109
- You're out of your mind!
- I'm not out of my mind.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:48.396
That guy is gonna be taped,
and we'll listen to what he says.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:52.863
Unless something horrendous is on that tape,
we're gonna put that tape on the air.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:58.532
All we're dealing with here is 10 minutes
of talk-show time against a man's life...

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.870
and I don't see that
as any argument.

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:05.413
Hello. How are you today?
Well, I'm calling...

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:09.004
Mr. King calling collect
long distance for Mr. Thomas.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:12.215
Mr. Thomas, there's a
long-distance call.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.880
Let's go.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:16.970
If this is it, remember,
keep him talking.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:19.511
Uh, hi, there. Who is this?

01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:22.305
<i>This is Mr. King.
I'm calling for Mr. King.</i>

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.519
Uh-huh. Well, you're right on time.

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:28.357
Yes, of course. We're always
punctual. We're fine, thank you.

01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:30.897
I wanna make it brief,
and I wanna tell you...

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:34.818
Could I break in and ask you,
could I speak to Jerry?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.409
No, Jerry's not with us. We're at a
payphone. Don't have the call traced.

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:41.745
I noticed you just did. I heard
the sounds. I do know those sounds.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:47.380
It's kind of important, so that we know that
he's in... What'll I say?... your care?

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:53.261
We've taken care of that by bringing along an
article of clothing that you will recognize.

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:57.845
It is not as easy as you think just to walk
in the studio, go right on the show...

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.385
No, Bert...
If I could call you, uh...

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:05.352
Well, if I could just say, there is no
problem. The material is clean material.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:09.439
- Do you know of Standards and Practices?
<i>- No, but that can be discussed.</i>

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:12.606
All I can say is don't
have any press leaks.

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:19.120
You must keep the audience there until 11:45
or 12:00, after it has been aired nationally.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:23.954
Thank you. We'll discuss the other things.
That's your problem. Nice talking to you.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:31.917
Boy, he's shrewd. He just,
uh, wouldn't buy anything.

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:32.192
I feel completely
impulsive tonight.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.945
Anything... Anything could happen.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.699
I have so much to tell you.
I don't know where to start.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:43.237
I wanna tell you everything about
myself, everything you don't know.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:49.957
Do you like these glasses? Crystal.
Beautiful. I bought them just for you.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:53.840
There's something about them.
Just the simplicity of them.

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:58.174
But if you don't like them, if there's even
an inkling, even a doubt in your mind...

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.891
Sometimes during the clay I'll
just be doing the simplest things.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:10.556
I'll be taking a bath
and I'll say to myself:

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:13.897
"Heh, I wonder if Jerry's
taking a bath right now."

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:17.776
And I just hope, you know, you're
not drowning or something, heh.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:22.239
I just get really worried about you,
like something terrible's gonna happen.

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:26.414
And I have these daydreams that I'm
out with you at the golf course...

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:29.701
driving your cart,
just driving around.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:34.088
"You need a putter, Jer?" You know?
Heh-heh-heh.

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.089
"Need an iron?"

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:38.630
I don't even know how to play golf.

01:20:38.656 --> 01:20:41.112
I played with my parents
once, my dad, but...

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.680
I love you.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.889
I've never told my parents
that I love them.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:55.439
They never told me they loved me
either, which was fine with me.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.603
But I love you.

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:02.317
Want some wine? No? Okay.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:05.111
I'm not in the mood to
drink either though.

01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:07.780
But I'm sure in the mood
to be alone with you.

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:13.456
Why don't we just
clear off the table?

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.926
I was thinking why don't we go
upstairs, but that's so predictable.

01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:22.963
Let's just take everything off
the table and do it right here.

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:28.305
That would blow your mind. It would blow my
mind. I've never done anything like that.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:31.562
I've never even had anybody over for
dinner, let alone made love on the table.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:38.444
But I just wanna do that. I just wanna dance.
I just wanna, like, put on some Shirelles.

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:40.650
I wanna be black.

01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.862
Wouldn't that be insane?

01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:47.653
God. You know who I
wish I was tonight?

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.290
I wish I was Tina Turner,
just dancing through the room.

01:21:57.663 --> 01:21:59.631
Thank you. Please
have your tickets ready.

01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:09.475
Good evening. My name is
Clarence McCabe. I'm the writer.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:12.182
- Are these people with you?
- Yes. This is my wife.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:16.520
- These people here?
- Her parents, from Cleveland, Ohio.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.606
- I'll check your name, sir.
- I'm gonna be on third.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.816
I'll check your name, sir.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:27.826
- I'm sorry, sir. I don't see your name, sir.
- You just went past the M's.

01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:31.706
I'll go back again for you, sir.
There it is again, sir.

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:34.959
Let me just check.
This isn't possible.

01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:39.042
- Did Miss Long call you?
- No, sir, she didn't.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:42.208
She didn't tell you about my book
and that I was gonna be on?

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:45.844
- Not according to this list.
- She told me to be here at a quarter to 6.

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:49.132
It's now 10 to 6. I've
only got 10 minutes.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:53.519
Only authorized personnel are allowed in.
That's the rules and regulations.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:58.524
You never heard of the book?
<i>The Vanishing Siberian Tiger?</i>

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:01.686
- Can I call Miss Long?
- You cannot call Miss Long at all.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:03.695
- Can you call Miss Long?
- No, sir.

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:08.735
Your name is not on the list, so I cannot let
you in. That's the rules and regulations.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:11.745
- I'm gonna try to get her. Miss Long?
- Stop him.

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:13.030
Miss Long?

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:16.246
Hey, hey. What's going on?
Let go of me!

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:24.508
Clarence!

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.340
- Miss Long!
- Clarence?

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.564
- What is this Clarence McCabe?
- That's who I am.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:47.277
- Is that your real name?
- Well, technically, it's my real name.

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:51.785
- No, it's a pseudonym, actually. An alias.
- Why do you use a pseudonym?

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:54.618
- I'm an author. That's my business.
- Author of what?

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.954
I told you. I wrote a book called
<i>The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.</i>

01:23:58.116 --> 01:24:01.586
I spent two years in Russia,
two years in China, researching it.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:05.466
- Two years in Russia, two in China?
- Right. Does that make me a Communist now?

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:17.436
We have one more light to preset.
That'll be number 47.

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:20.473
- Hello, I'm the King.
- What?

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:24.485
- The King.
- What can I do for Your Highness?

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.361
Really, I'm the King.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.242
Your dressing room's backstage. Your throne
is in there also. You'll recognize the door.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.447
Very funny.

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:35.237
- There's a half-moon, stars.
- Ls there someone in charge?

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:40.160
Mr. Ding. He's a little fella with an
ice-cream cone nose, a couple of bells.

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:41.998
- Miss Long.
- Mr. Pipkin?

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.915
No, it's Mr. Pupkin, Miss Long.
Mr. Pupkin. How are you?

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:49.836
What are you doing
here, Mr. Pupkin?

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:51.720
I'm the King.

01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:54.802
I think you're expecting me.

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:58.097
- Yeah.
- Yes. Mr. Thomas around?

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.285
<i>You're gonna love me</i>

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:23.248
<i>Like nobody's loved me</i>

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:28.291
<i>Come rain or come shine</i>

01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:33.383
<i>Happy together</i>

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:37.266
<i>Unhappy together</i>

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:43.727
<i>And won't it be fine?</i>

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:52.149
<i>Days may be cloudy or sunny</i>

01:25:54.566 --> 01:26:01.575
<i>We're in and we're out of the money</i>

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:08.002
<i>I'm with you always</i>

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:13.757
<i>I'm with you</i>

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:17.256
<i>Rain</i>

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:24.973
<i>Or shine</i>

01:26:29.393 --> 01:26:31.111
- Mr. King?
- Yes.

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:32.862
I'm Inspector Gerrity from the FBI.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.318
- Do you understand?
- Mm-hm.

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:35.562
What is your name?

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:38.285
- Rupert Pupkin.
- What is your real name?

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.491
That's my real name. Rupert Pupkin.

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:45.581
Well, Mr. Pupkin, are you gonna tell
us where Jerry Langford is or not?

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:48.204
- Are you from the show?
- No, I'm not in the show.

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:53.126
This is my assistant, Agent Giardello, and
Captain Burke of the New York City Police.

01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:55.134
I'd like to meet
someone from the show.

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:58.763
You don't get to see anyone with the
show until I get to see Langford.

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:00.970
I'd like to see someone
from the show first.

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:03.977
You won't see someone unless
you tell us where Langford is.

01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.605
Well, then Jerry Langford is dead.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.896
Get Thomas.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:16.111
- I'm Bert Thomas. Are you Mr. King?
- Yes. How do you do?

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:19.903
- Uh, did we talk on the phone today?
- Yes, we spoke a few moments ago.

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.821
- And then Jerry spoke to you earlier.
- Uh...

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:28.665
- Where did you get this?
- That's Jerry's, as you can see.

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:32.047
- What's that?
- That's my blood, not Jerry's, heh.

01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:34.674
I'll buy this. What have we here?

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:39.430
This is my introduction, and I'd like Mr.
Randall, if he could, speak it word for word.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:43.092
Randall's introduction to your monologue?
Could I have a copy of your monologue?

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:44.305
Uh...

01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:47.688
Actually, I have it memorized,
so I don't have a copy of it.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:51.896
There are reasons I need a copy. We have to
make sure you don't say anything obscene...

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:54.937
or anything that could cause
a problem in the audience.

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:58.277
No, it's all right, really.
It's a wholesome monologue.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.943
- You guarantee it?
- Nothing obscene. I guarantee it.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:04.204
Make sure you got that
audience till after 11:30.

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:08.287
- The man's gonna get everything he asks for.
- Thank you. It's nice meeting you.

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.540
Sit down, Pupkin.

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:13.267
Mr. Pupkin, I gotta tell you this.

01:28:13.293 --> 01:28:16.742
From this point on, you have
the right to remain silent.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.377
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.263
Because anything you say
from here on out...

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:24.345
might be used against you later on
in a court of law. You understand?

01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:27.057
- Say you understand.
- I understand that.

01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:30.723
Did you participate
in the abduction of Jerry Langford?

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:33.233
Yes, I did. I abducted him.

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:36.235
You abducted him? Do you know
where Mr. Langford is now?

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:37.691
Yes, I do.

01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:41.199
- Will you lead us to Mr. Langford?
- No, I won't.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:46.865
At this time, Mr. Pupkin, I want to advise
you to consider yourself under arrest.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:49.499
Fine. I think I should get made up.

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:53.420
You need some make-up.
Put some color on his face.

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.296
I'd like to put some
color on your face.

01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:59.009
Really, I should get made up.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:02.762
"... sad news for you." Turn
the card. "I have some sad..."

01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:05.470
- Tony, did you wanna see me?
- Have you seen this stuff?

01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:07.600
I've gone over it.
I think it's fine.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:12.230
This is fine? "My writing staff was executed
in Central Park by the network firing squad."

01:29:12.389 --> 01:29:14.437
- I think it's good.
- You're laughing at that?

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:17.102
- Do me a favor, please.
- Why do I have to say this?

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:22.275
Exactly as it's written. It'll play
for us. It'll be good for you. Trust me.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.115
- You're the director. Can you help me?
- Take the tissues out and let's go.

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:30.408
- A few more minutes. Let's go.
- Turn the cards fast. Are you listening?

01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:31.917
- Turn the cards fast.
- Okay.

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:36.125
Let's do something crazy tonight.
Just get insane. I wanna be crazy!

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:39.132
I wanna be nuts!
I wanna have some fun! Goddamn it.

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:43.216
My doctor says, "Don't have any fun. No,
you're not allowed to have a good time.

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:45.801
You can't get crazy."
See, I have to be in control.

01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:47.307
And I like being in control.

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:51.971
But for one night I'd like to see
myself out of my head! Wouldn't you?

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:54.731
Wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be fabulous?

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:58.185
I'm having a good time.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.325
I'm having fun.

01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:08.612
Fun is my middle name.
I'm having fun.

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:14.243
That's right. Having some fun.
Never had this much fun before.

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:16.252
That's right.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:21.838
Good, old-fashioned,
all-American fun.

01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:27.673
And now, direct from New York,
<i>it's The Jerry Langford Show...</i>

01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:31.514
with guest host Tony Randall
and his special guests:

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:36.022
Shelley Winters, Gore
Vidal, Tony Bennett...

01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:40.482
as always, Lou Brown and the orchestra
and little old me, Ed Herlihy.

01:30:40.644 --> 01:30:43.443
For now, say hello to Tony!

01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:04.676
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. I have some sad news for you.

01:31:04.834 --> 01:31:06.302
Aw!

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:11.638
Earlier today, my writing staff was executed
in Central Park by the network firing squad.

01:31:13.009 --> 01:31:16.855
So there will be no sensational
Randall monologue this evening.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:27.403
No embarrassing display
of emotion, please.

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:31.695
Instead we're going to do something a little
bit different this evening. A lot different.

01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:34.239
We're going to give you a glimpse...
Turn it over, please.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:36.784
Ha-ha-ha.
...Into the future.

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:40.921
It isn't often you can call someone a
sure thing in the entertainment business.

01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:44.253
After all, the verdict is always
in your hands, isn't it?

01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:47.010
But I think tonight,
after you've met...

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:52.762
my first guest...

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:58.181
you'll agree with me that he's destined
for greatness, in one way or another.

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:02.943
So will you please give your warmest
greetings to the newest King of Comedy...

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:05.103
Rupert Pupkin!

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:23.171
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Let me
introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin.

01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:30.128
I can't believe I'm gonna kiss you.

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:33.803
Masha.

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:35.804
Take the tape off.

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:38.770
Really?

01:32:38.928 --> 01:32:40.976
Go on. Take it off.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:50.323
- I'm ready now.
- Take him back down.

01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:51.574
With pleasure.

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:55.738
Why did you do this? Tell me why and then
maybe I'll be able to believe in you.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:58.953
- Why did you do such a thing?
- Do you know what time it is?

01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:01.789
- It's five minutes to 11.
- I think we better go.

01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:06.832
Because otherwise-I don't like to say it
like this... Jerry's gonna be unavailable.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:10.377
- You'll understand when we go.
- I'll understand? Why will I understand?

01:33:10.543 --> 01:33:12.216
Where are we going?

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:16.634
- Well, that's part of the bargain.
- Part of what bargain?

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.771
That's my understanding. Now, I just
want to see it in this other place.

01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:24.524
And once I see it, that's it.
I'll give you Langford.

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:26.650
- But you don't understand my position.
- Uh-huh.

01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:27.857
I have you right now.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:30.863
- That's true.
- If I have you, I have a shot at Langford.

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:34.196
- But you don't have Jerry.
- I understand that.

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:37.866
I'm getting it off
as fast as I can.

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:40.953
- That's good, Masha.
- Yeah?

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.161
- You all right?
- I'm doing fine.

01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:45.920
I know you are.

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:48.582
Come on.

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:58.221
One more thing, please. I can't walk
in here with you. If you could both...

01:33:58.383 --> 01:34:02.104
if you could just wait here and let
me walk in by myself, that's all.

01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:04.731
I'll break your ankles if
you make a wrong move.

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:07.733
I promise. I promise, okay?

01:34:07.892 --> 01:34:10.441
But make believe you
don't know me too.

01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:11.695
Go ahead.

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:41.096
Jerry, you seem a little bit...

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:55.948
Jerry! Jerry, wait!

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:58.109
Jerry! Jerry!

01:34:59.485 --> 01:35:01.579
Jerry, come back here!

01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:04.787
Jerry!

01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:12.006
Oh, God.

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:14.551
What do you want now?

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:22.055
- What are you doing? I'm watching that.
- Just a minute.

01:35:22.217 --> 01:35:26.393
<i>And now, direct from New York,
it's The Jerry Langford Show...</i>

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:31.151
<i>with guest host Tony Randall and
his special guests: Shelley Winters...</i>

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:35.985

- Do you know him?

01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:41.244
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Just sit tight. Relax-Everything" be okay.

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:46.287
<i>My first guest, you'll agree with me

01:35:46.449 --> 01:35:48.497

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:53.006
<i>So will you please give your warmest
greetings to the newest King of Comedy...</i>

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:55.258
<i>Rupert Pupkin!</i>

01:36:08.054 --> 01:36:11.058
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Let me introduce myself.

01:36:11.224 --> 01:36:12.851
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:18.235
I was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which
was not at that time a federal offense.

01:36:20.233 --> 01:36:22.486
Is there anyone here from Clifton?

01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:24.029
Good, we can all relax now.

01:36:25.738 --> 01:36:28.787
Now, I'd like to begin by saying
that my parents were too poor...

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:31.874
to afford me a childhood
in Clifton...

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:36.045
but the fact is that no one is allowed
to be really too poor in Clifton.

01:36:36.207 --> 01:36:39.552
Once you fall below a certain
level, they exile you to Passaic.

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:48.562
But my parents did put the first
two down payments on my childhood.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.472
Don't get me wrong.

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:53.391
But they did also return me
to the hospital as defective.

01:36:56.978 --> 01:37:01.404
But like everyone else, I grew up
in large part thanks to my mother.

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.910
If she were only
here today, I'd say:

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:06.912
"Hey, Mom! What are you doing here?
You've been dead for nine years!"

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:14.796
But seriously, you should've seen
my mother. She was wonderful.

01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:17.833
Blond, beautiful,
intelligent, alcoholic...

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:24.548
We used to drink milk together after school.
Mine was homogenized, hers was loaded.

01:37:26.382 --> 01:37:29.306
Once they picked her up for speeding.
They clocked her doing 50.

01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:30.937
All right, but in our garage?

01:37:38.144 --> 01:37:39.655
And, you know, when
they tested her,

01:37:39.681 --> 01:37:41.844
they found out that her
alcohol had 2 percent blood.

01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:51.287
But we used to joke
together, Mom and me...

01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:56.455
until the tears would stroll down her
face and she would throw up! Yeah.

01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:59.249
And who would clean it up?
Ha, not Dad.

01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:04.171
He was too busy down at O'Grady's,
throwing up on his own. Yeah.

01:38:04.337 --> 01:38:08.433
In fact, until I was 16, I thought
throwing up was a sign of maturity.

01:38:09.926 --> 01:38:13.476
While the other kids were off in
the woods sneaking cigarettes...

01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:16.232
I was hiding behind the house
with my fingers down my throat.

01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:28.287
The only problem was I never got anywhere,
until one day my father caught me.

01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:32.950
And, you know, just as he was giving me
a final kick in the stomach for luck...

01:38:33.116 --> 01:38:36.586
I managed to heave
all over his new shoes!

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:40.465
"That's it!" I thought.
"I've made it! I'm finally a man!"

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.138
But, as it turned out,
I was wrong.

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:54.179
That was the only attention
my father ever gave me.

01:38:54.345 --> 01:38:55.392
Aw...

01:38:55.555 --> 01:39:00.652
Yeah, he was usually too busy out in the
park playing ball with my sister Rose.

01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:02.153
Aw...

01:39:02.311 --> 01:39:05.531
But today, I must say, thanks to
those many hours of practice...

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:08.409
my sister Rose has
grown into a fine man.

01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:16.702
Me, I wasn't interested
in athletics.

01:39:16.868 --> 01:39:20.839
The only exercise I ever got was
when the other kids picked on me.

01:39:20.997 --> 01:39:23.671
They used to beat me up once
a week, usually Tuesday.

01:39:25.334 --> 01:39:28.053
And after a while, the school
worked it into the curriculum.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:32.555
And if you knocked me out,
you got extra credit.

01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:38.056
Except there was this one kid.
Poor kid. He was afraid of me.

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:41.601
I used to tell him, "Hit me, hit me!
What's the matter with you?

01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:43.440
Don't you wanna graduate?"

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:50.799
As for me, hey, I was
the youngest kid

01:39:50.825 --> 01:39:53.685
in the history of the school
to graduate in traction.

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:02.289
But, you know, my only real interest, right
from the beginning, was show business.

01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:05.880
Even as a young man, I began at the
very top, collecting autographs.

01:40:08.794 --> 01:40:10.671
Now...

01:40:12.298 --> 01:40:16.428
a lot of you are probably wondering
why Jerry isn't with us tonight.

01:40:16.594 --> 01:40:19.097
Well, I'll tell you,
the fact is he's tied up.

01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:20.435
And I'm the one who tied him.

01:40:24.185 --> 01:40:29.316
I know you think I'm joking, but that's the
only way I could break into show business...

01:40:29.482 --> 01:40:32.201
by hijacking Jerry Langford.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.614
Right now Jerry is strapped to a chair
somewhere in the middle of this city.

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:47.258
Go ahead and laugh. Thank you. I appreciate
it. But the fact is, I'm here.

01:40:47.416 --> 01:40:50.920
Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding
and you'll think I was crazy.

01:40:51.087 --> 01:40:55.308
But, look, I figure it this way: better to be
king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.

01:40:58.553 --> 01:41:00.772
Thank you. Thank you.

01:41:41.012 --> 01:41:44.858
- How'd you do that?
- Did you like it? Thank you.

01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:49.021
I'd like to buy everyone here a drink,
and I hope you all enjoyed the show.

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:52.907
- Rita, you keep the change.
- We're getting Langford now.

01:41:53.065 --> 01:41:57.445
Rita, just because I made it big doesn't
mean I'm gonna forget about you.

01:41:58.321 --> 01:42:00.824
- Remember, I'll call you...
- No more speeches.

01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:02.992
- What's happening here?
- Take care.

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:08.541
That's the same guy who was just
on television. Just now. Same guy.

01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:14.212
I'm just getting even. Those jokes...
Those jokes were murder.

01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:16.551
- You didn't like those jokes?
- No. No.

01:42:16.714 --> 01:42:19.532
I'm looking for the guy
that wrote the material.

01:42:19.558 --> 01:42:22.087
I'd like to pick him
up and take him along.

01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:27.851
I wrote the material. I disagree with you.
I thought they were very good jokes.

01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:32.693
If you wrote that material,
I got one piece of advice for you.

01:42:32.855 --> 01:42:37.076
Throw yourself on your knees in front
of the judge and beg for mercy.

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.828
That's very funny, but you'll see.
