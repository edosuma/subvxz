00:08.055 --> 00:09.506
This week on "Vice":

00:09.591 --> 00:13.510
The amazing new progress in
restoring sight to the blind.

00:14.346 --> 00:16.846
I think I saw something flash.

00:16.982 --> 00:19.015
It's really, really weird.

00:19.151 --> 00:21.234
That's okay, don't worry.

00:21.353 --> 00:24.187
Would you advise someone
to have that surgery?

00:24.273 --> 00:25.522
Honestly, I wouldn't
recommend it.

00:25.607 --> 00:27.023
It can make you feel crazy.

00:27.109 --> 00:32.279
And then, big business is taking
over the marijuana industry.

00:32.363 --> 00:37.200
It's so enormous. I can't even
see the edges of the room.

00:37.286 --> 00:40.954
It's the biggest tsunami ever to hit
the world, in my lifetime, of money!

00:42.090 --> 00:44.291

00:48.547 --> 00:49.629

01:04.229 --> 01:06.780
Modern medicine has made
incredible advances

01:06.898 --> 01:09.899
in restoring eyesight, thanks
to cutting-edge technology

01:10.035 --> 01:13.236
and a revolution in
cost-efficient materials.

01:13.372 --> 01:15.622
And that could mean
a total transformation

01:15.741 --> 01:20.126
for millions of visually impaired
people desperate to see again.

01:20.245 --> 01:23.496
♪ ♪

01:26.218 --> 01:29.836
(indistinct conversations)

01:29.921 --> 01:32.972
Doctor: The white, cloudy,
substance you're seeing

01:33.091 --> 01:35.091
is the cataract,
which is a cloudy lens,

01:35.227 --> 01:40.347
so I'm just very gently teasing
the lens until it's free,

01:40.432 --> 01:42.766
and now we're going
to remove it from the eye.

01:42.901 --> 01:44.017
Yeung:
Ooh, that's it?

01:44.102 --> 01:46.653
That is the cataract,
and it is gone.

01:46.772 --> 01:49.612
That's incredible that you can just
get rid of it in a matter of seconds.

01:49.658 --> 01:51.574
Stage one is getting
the cataract out.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.443
Stage two is getting
the new lens in.

01:53.528 --> 01:58.248
And I put it in the exact same
place where the cataract was.

01:58.333 --> 02:02.085
So no stitches needed,
and I'm done.

02:02.170 --> 02:03.953
Yeung: Wow. That was
incredibly quick.

02:04.089 --> 02:05.872
Very quick.
That was insane.

02:05.957 --> 02:08.375
Onto the next one.

02:08.460 --> 02:11.461
Around 19 million people in the world
are blind because of cataracts,

02:11.596 --> 02:14.714
and that number is disproportionately
high in developing countries,

02:14.800 --> 02:16.633
which is why we're in Ethiopia.

02:16.718 --> 02:19.018
<i>Traditionally, if you become
blind in a country like this,</i>

02:19.137 --> 02:21.304
<i>then that's pretty much it,
you're blind for life.</i>

02:21.390 --> 02:24.357
<i>But we're here to see an intervention,
which is hoping to change all that.</i>

02:24.476 --> 02:27.560
<i>Dr. Matt Oliva is part of the
Himalayan Cataract Project,</i>

02:27.646 --> 02:31.981
<i>an NGO working tirelessly to eradicate
blindness in developing countries.</i>

02:32.117 --> 02:35.034
Blindness in Ethiopia is a
death sentence, it really is.

02:35.153 --> 02:36.986
And it's a social problem,

02:37.072 --> 02:38.621
it's a human suffering problem,

02:38.707 --> 02:41.074
and it's an economic problem.

03:07.068 --> 03:11.905
Oliva: All the supplies for one
case that we need cost under $20.

03:12.023 --> 03:13.740
While I've been working here,

03:13.859 --> 03:16.025
the staff has been getting
the next patient ready,

03:16.111 --> 03:18.528
and it's back and forth,
back and forth all day long.

03:18.663 --> 03:22.115
Yeung: <i>For each eye, the surgery
can be as fast as five minutes.</i>

03:22.200 --> 03:24.784
How many surgeries are you
actually able to do every day?

03:24.870 --> 03:27.203
Probably do about 70 today.

03:27.289 --> 03:28.922
Yeung:
<i>And Dr. Oliva is just one</i>

03:29.040 --> 03:31.458
<i>of four doctors operating
on 700 patients</i>

03:31.543 --> 03:32.876
<i>over the course of a week.</i>

03:33.011 --> 03:35.462
The speed at which these guys
are working is insane.

03:35.547 --> 03:37.380
It's almost like a factory line.

03:37.516 --> 03:42.118
<i>The recovery time is quick
as well, less than 24 hours.</i>

03:42.220 --> 03:44.971
This is the best moment
of every morning,

03:45.056 --> 03:47.640
is getting ready
to take the patches off

03:47.726 --> 03:49.893
and see all our hard work
from yesterday.

03:50.028 --> 03:51.110
Whoa, these are--

03:51.229 --> 03:53.813
This is everyone
who had surgery yesterday?

03:53.899 --> 03:55.782
Oliva:
These are all 200 people.

03:55.901 --> 03:59.452
Yeung: What do you think those 200
or so patients are going through

03:59.571 --> 04:00.987
when you first take off
those bandages?

04:01.072 --> 04:03.323
Oliva: <i>I think it's
overwhelming for most patients.</i>

04:03.408 --> 04:06.376
<i>Some of these people
have been blind 10 years,</i>

04:06.461 --> 04:07.994
<i>sometimes even 15 years,</i>

04:08.079 --> 04:10.330
<i>so there's sort of
an adaptation problem,</i>

04:10.415 --> 04:12.048
<i>and you can see it
in their faces,</i>

04:12.133 --> 04:15.718
where there is sort of
a slow reestablishment

04:15.804 --> 04:19.005
of the neural pathways
in the brain.

04:25.814 --> 04:27.146
(in foreign language)

04:27.265 --> 04:32.569
(ululating)
(laughing)

04:34.856 --> 04:37.323
(ululating)

04:41.079 --> 04:43.830
(cheering)

04:46.117 --> 04:48.952
(in foreign language)

04:50.372 --> 04:53.506
This is literally one of the most
amazing things I've ever seen.

04:53.625 --> 04:57.043
In, like, a matter of seconds
those bandages come off

04:57.128 --> 05:00.213
and their entire lives
are completely transformed.

05:00.298 --> 05:04.183
(in foreign language)

05:09.391 --> 05:11.891
Yeung: <i>This cataract surgery
is now widely available</i>

05:11.977 --> 05:13.359
<i>in the developing world</i>

05:13.478 --> 05:16.145
<i>because of a revolution
in low cost materials.</i>

05:16.231 --> 05:21.568
<i>And it's just one of a wave of promising
new advances in restoring sight.</i>

05:23.238 --> 05:27.490
<i>And that could mean radical change
for people like Anthony Andreottola.</i>

05:27.626 --> 05:30.159
<i>Anthony is an addiction
counselor in Boston.</i>

05:30.295 --> 05:33.246
<i>A progressive condition called
retinitis pigmentosa</i>

05:33.331 --> 05:35.331
<i>has left him completely blind.</i>

05:35.417 --> 05:40.503
It was in my late 30s when I lost
the ability to recognize faces.

05:40.639 --> 05:44.674
I considered that when I crossed
the line of being blind, yeah.

05:44.759 --> 05:47.143
And how did it impact,
like, everyday life?

05:47.228 --> 05:51.014
Being independent,
traveling is a real big deal.

05:52.734 --> 05:54.651
<i>I go back and forth
to work by myself,</i>

05:54.736 --> 05:58.521
<i>and, uh, that sometimes
can be a challenge.</i>

05:58.657 --> 06:00.523
<i>You see some
blind people with a cane,</i>

06:00.609 --> 06:03.109
<i>they're like ballerinas
going down the street.</i>

06:03.194 --> 06:04.994
<i>I'm not. I go kind of slow.</i>

06:05.080 --> 06:06.696
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I did not see you.

06:06.781 --> 06:08.781
It's okay. That's all right.
I'm so sorry.

06:08.867 --> 06:09.999
No problem.

06:10.085 --> 06:12.669
These hybrid cars now,
they're much quieter.

06:12.754 --> 06:16.039
<i>They can really sneak up on a
blind person crossing the street.</i>

06:16.124 --> 06:17.206
(car honks)

06:17.292 --> 06:20.209
But it's--
it's just part of life.

06:20.345 --> 06:22.929
Yeung: <i>A part of life that
he's hoping will soon change</i>

06:23.048 --> 06:26.716
<i>because in a few days, Anthony will be
one of the first few hundred patients</i>

06:26.851 --> 06:31.187
<i>to receive the Argus II, the first
retinal implant approved by the FDA.</i>

06:31.272 --> 06:35.441
<i>We met with Dr. Robert Greenberg,
chairman of Second Sight,</i>

06:35.560 --> 06:37.193
<i>which manufactures the device.</i>

06:37.278 --> 06:40.363
The Argus II is available for a
disease called retinitis pigmentosa.

06:40.448 --> 06:44.317
It's a small pill-sized device
that goes in and around the eye,

06:44.402 --> 06:46.602
coupled with a pair of glasses
that have a video camera.

06:46.705 --> 06:50.456
So here we've got the camera that's picking
up the signal in front of the patient.

06:50.575 --> 06:53.576
That signal is going to the processor
that you have in your hands.

06:53.712 --> 06:56.829
That processed signal is going
up to the antenna

06:56.915 --> 07:00.633
and the signal is getting sent wirelessly
to the implant in and around the eye.

07:00.752 --> 07:03.586
<i>The retina is like
a multi-layered cake,</i>

07:03.722 --> 07:05.421
<i>and in the retinitis
pigmentosa patients,</i>

07:05.507 --> 07:08.341
<i>the bottom layer of the cake,
those photoreceptors are dead.</i>

07:08.426 --> 07:11.928
But the upper layer of the cake and the
cable going back to the brain are intact.

07:12.013 --> 07:14.681
<i>And we're essentially replacing
those photoreceptors.</i>

07:14.766 --> 07:18.351
<i>To the brain, this signal is coming
from the retina as far as it knows.</i>

07:18.436 --> 07:20.520
It's like the screen has broken,

07:20.605 --> 07:22.522
but the computer inside
is still working.

07:22.607 --> 07:24.991
Exactly. The best description
of what they see

07:25.110 --> 07:27.190
is something like a crude
black and white television.

07:27.278 --> 07:29.278
Blurry levels of gray,

07:29.414 --> 07:31.114
but it's enough
for people to get around.

07:31.199 --> 07:32.865
It's enough for people
to see a loved one,

07:32.951 --> 07:35.618
and it's life-changing
for a lot of folks.

07:35.704 --> 07:38.788
Yeung: <i>We went with Anthony
to Johns Hopkins Hospital</i>

07:38.923 --> 07:40.957
<i>where he had
the device implanted.</i>

07:41.042 --> 07:45.128
So they've just put him to
sleep, so the surgery can begin.

07:45.263 --> 07:47.880
Man: Okay. We're ready
for the device.

07:47.966 --> 07:50.767
This is what goes
inside the eye.

07:50.852 --> 07:53.553
Yeung: Dr. Handa's just attaching
the actual device now,

07:53.638 --> 07:57.523
and then wrapping it around with a
sort of belt to keep it in place.

07:57.642 --> 08:01.694
Those little dots there are the
60 electrodes? Handa: Correct.

08:01.813 --> 08:04.647
It's incredible that what looks like
this tiny little piece of plastic

08:04.733 --> 08:08.818
could possibly give the gift of
sight back to someone's eye.

08:08.903 --> 08:11.154
Handa: So now I'm putting
it into the eye.

08:11.239 --> 08:13.656
Yeung: Wow, so you can actually
see the device going in.

08:16.211 --> 08:17.877
All right.
Everything good?

08:17.996 --> 08:20.546
Yeah. So, when will you
turn the device on?

08:20.665 --> 08:22.298
Probably in about a month or so.

08:22.383 --> 08:23.833
Then he has to learn how to see.

08:23.968 --> 08:25.084
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)

08:25.170 --> 08:27.637
Yeung: <i>But learning to
see will be a challenge.</i>

08:27.722 --> 08:30.556
<i>The Argus II is only a
second-generation technology,</i>

08:30.675 --> 08:35.561
<i>and at this early stage the images
it transmits are rudimentary.</i>

08:35.679 --> 08:37.179
Whoa. Okay.

08:37.265 --> 08:39.265
So, this is what
people with Argus II see?

08:39.350 --> 08:41.017
Dr. Greenberg: Yes, this
is our best approximation.

08:41.152 --> 08:43.402
I can see black
and white shapes.

08:44.989 --> 08:46.856
That was my shoulder.
This is your face.

08:46.991 --> 08:47.991
Yup.

08:48.026 --> 08:50.693
It really is a case
of learning how to see

08:50.829 --> 08:51.994
in a different
way then, isn't it?

08:52.080 --> 08:53.696
It is. It's learning
how to see again.

08:53.832 --> 08:56.532
And it's really crude vision.

08:56.618 --> 08:59.035
<i>Expectations are
really important,</i>

08:59.170 --> 09:01.420
<i>and one of the worst things
that could happen would be</i>

09:01.539 --> 09:05.508
if a patient went into the surgery expecting
to see perfectly when they came out,

09:05.593 --> 09:07.460
and then they're likely
to be disappointed.

09:07.545 --> 09:10.596
Yeung: <i>A month later, Anthony
returned to Johns Hopkins.</i>

09:10.715 --> 09:13.766
How are you feeling about
getting this device turned on?

09:13.885 --> 09:17.687
I guess I'm hoping
not to be disappointed.

09:17.772 --> 09:22.558
But I guess
any improvement's gonna be...

09:22.644 --> 09:24.026
it's gonna be meaningful.

09:24.112 --> 09:26.472
Yeung: <i>The first step for Anthony
is testing and calibrating</i>

09:26.531 --> 09:30.066
<i>the strength of the 60 individual
electrodes in his implant.</i>

09:30.151 --> 09:31.367
Ready?
Yeah.

09:31.452 --> 09:32.902
Here we go.

09:33.037 --> 09:34.654
(computer beeps)

09:34.739 --> 09:38.241
I think I saw something,
like, flash.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.459
Okay. Here's
another one.

09:40.578 --> 09:41.578
(computer beeps)

09:41.713 --> 09:43.880
Yeah, I saw something
else then, too.

09:43.965 --> 09:45.248
(laughing)

09:45.383 --> 09:48.251
That's okay, don't worry.

09:48.386 --> 09:50.002
(Yeung speaking)

09:54.926 --> 09:56.559
Does it feel weird?

09:56.644 --> 09:58.561
It's like this eye,

09:58.646 --> 10:01.264
but I feel like
I see it over here.

10:01.399 --> 10:04.517
It's really, really weird.

10:04.602 --> 10:07.436
Yeung: <i>After a night's rest,
Anthony returned with his daughter</i>

10:07.572 --> 10:10.273
<i>to finally have the device
fully powered on.</i>

10:10.408 --> 10:12.191
I think we're ready.

10:15.914 --> 10:17.280
What do you see?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.951
I see stuff, like...

10:23.004 --> 10:24.670
There, you're picking up
Dr. Handa.

10:24.789 --> 10:27.173
This is a white coat.

10:27.292 --> 10:29.008
Something going like this.

10:29.928 --> 10:31.260
So, that's easier.

10:31.346 --> 10:33.095
Yeah. (laughing)

10:33.181 --> 10:34.847
What's up, kid?
Nothing.

10:36.768 --> 10:40.636
I just got an image of you
right over here.

10:40.722 --> 10:44.640
Look up and tell me if you
can see the ceiling lights.

10:44.776 --> 10:45.776
Right there.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.109
Okay, now keep looking,

10:47.195 --> 10:49.445
and see if you can pick up
more of the ceiling lights.

10:50.949 --> 10:51.781
Right there.

10:51.866 --> 10:54.283
Yeah, there's
another one, right.

10:57.205 --> 10:59.906
Do you feel like
it could be useful?

10:59.991 --> 11:02.825
Is it like, the greatest
thing in the world,

11:02.961 --> 11:06.162
to have, you know,
this limited vision?

11:06.297 --> 11:07.713
I can't say yet,

11:07.832 --> 11:10.549
but I think it's better than
not having it at all.

11:10.668 --> 11:14.170
Yeung: <i> Although the Argus II shows
promise for patients like Anthony</i>

11:14.305 --> 11:16.055
<i>who once had vision and lost it,</i>

11:16.174 --> 11:20.509
<i>some experts are warning that for all the
advances we've made in fighting blindness,</i>

11:20.595 --> 11:24.513
<i>we haven't actually stopped to consider
what it means to restore sight</i>

11:24.599 --> 11:26.399
<i>to someone who's never
had it at all.</i>

11:26.517 --> 11:30.436
<i>Dr. Ione Fine is a psychologist
at the University of Washington,</i>

11:30.521 --> 11:33.105
<i>who studies how blindness
affects the brain.</i>

11:33.191 --> 11:37.159
In the case of someone who is born blind
and has been blind all their life,

11:37.245 --> 11:41.197
their visual system is very different
from that of someone with normal vision,

11:41.332 --> 11:44.784
and restoring vision is going to result in
a very different perceptual experience.

11:44.869 --> 11:47.036
Yeung: <i>She's talking
about people like Marti,</i>

11:47.121 --> 11:48.454
<i>who's been blind since birth.</i>

11:48.539 --> 11:52.208
<i>At the age of 42, she began
a series of surgeries</i>

11:52.293 --> 11:56.512
<i>that reconstructed her iris, and implanted
a new lens into one of her eyes.</i>

11:56.597 --> 12:00.383
<i>She now has vision just below
the threshold of legally blind,</i>

12:00.518 --> 12:03.052
<i>enough for her
to begin painting.</i>

12:03.938 --> 12:05.554
I don't know which one this is.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.058
This is a lot of specks,
and you can see the sky.

12:09.143 --> 12:10.893
(gasps) Oh, wait a minute.

12:11.029 --> 12:12.862
Is this one...

12:12.947 --> 12:14.647
Does it look like an ocean?

12:14.732 --> 12:18.651
There's a lighthouse.
You see a lighthouse?

12:18.736 --> 12:20.319
Uh...
A little bit?

12:20.405 --> 12:22.905
Is it in the distance?
Mm-hmm.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.374
Oh, wait a minute.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.659
Holding it the wrong way?

12:26.744 --> 12:28.461
I think we're holding it--
Yeah. Makes more sense.

12:28.579 --> 12:30.546
You can turn it different ways
to make it what you want.

12:30.631 --> 12:34.216
Yeung: <i> But while Marti is now trying
to make her way in the sighted world,</i>

12:34.302 --> 12:37.219
<i>her transition out of total
blindness wasn't easy.</i>

12:37.305 --> 12:40.006
What was your immediate
reaction after the surgery?

12:40.091 --> 12:41.974
Ugh, I wanted to die.

12:42.093 --> 12:44.760
So what does that say?

12:44.846 --> 12:48.681
The brain wouldn't shut off.
It was just... overload.

12:48.766 --> 12:51.767
Did other people have expectations?
Oh, yeah.

12:51.853 --> 12:53.769
They felt like...

12:53.905 --> 12:55.321
That it was so wonderful,

12:55.440 --> 12:57.857
and I could just get up and
walk around and be fine.

12:57.942 --> 13:01.277
And people say, "Well, shut
your eyes and do things blind,"

13:01.362 --> 13:04.246
but it's-- you can't do that.
It's a big difference.

13:04.332 --> 13:06.949
When I was blind,
I didn't see black.

13:07.035 --> 13:10.252
And now, when I shut
my eyes, I see black.

13:10.338 --> 13:12.755
It's not the same
as being blind.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.675
Would you advise someone who was
in the same situation as you

13:16.794 --> 13:18.294
to have that surgery?

13:18.429 --> 13:20.296
Honestly, I wouldn't
recommend it.

13:20.431 --> 13:21.597
Why?

13:21.682 --> 13:24.633
Because when you live a certain
way for so many years,

13:24.769 --> 13:27.436
and you're adjusted to life
and everything around you,

13:27.522 --> 13:30.139
and then all of a sudden
there's a change like this,

13:30.224 --> 13:32.391
it can make you feel crazy.

13:34.112 --> 13:36.479
If people are blind
early enough in life,

13:36.614 --> 13:38.230
they do in fact
lose the ability,

13:38.316 --> 13:41.200
or never gain the ability to
make sense of the visual world.

13:41.319 --> 13:43.986
And we think that perhaps one
of the reasons that happens

13:44.122 --> 13:47.156
is that the back of the head
starts responding to other senses,

13:47.291 --> 13:49.408
like audition and touch.

13:49.494 --> 13:51.827
It becomes specialized
to help blind people

13:51.963 --> 13:54.997
make their way through the world
using these other senses.

13:55.133 --> 13:57.917
That can be a huge problem
if sight is ever restored.

13:58.002 --> 14:03.639
And maybe putting our efforts into
making the world easier for blind people

14:03.724 --> 14:05.591
to navigate
and be independent in

14:05.676 --> 14:08.811
is at least as valid as trying
to fix them and be like us.

14:08.896 --> 14:11.680
Yeung: <i>Even so, for those
desperate to see again,</i>

14:11.766 --> 14:14.850
<i>the technology we've developed
can be life-changing.</i>

14:14.986 --> 14:16.685

Good.

14:24.362 --> 14:26.028
<i>to see how he's adapting.</i>

14:26.164 --> 14:28.364
Can you see these
people walking past?

14:28.449 --> 14:29.365
Yup.

14:29.450 --> 14:30.616
That's good.

14:30.701 --> 14:33.702
Anthony: <i>I still have to
use my cane to navigate,</i>

14:33.788 --> 14:36.288
but it does work.
I can see you.

14:36.374 --> 14:41.877
And I feel more involved
in what's going on around me.

14:41.963 --> 14:44.930
That was a truck, a big truck,
a bus or something. Yeah.

14:45.049 --> 14:49.218
Rather than being totally blind,
I have, like, visual cues

14:49.303 --> 14:52.188
that I didn't have,
that I lost years ago.

14:52.273 --> 14:54.273
<i>I see it as a start.</i>

14:54.392 --> 14:56.392
<i>There's a lot more advances,</i>

know, this is as good as it gets

22:20.387 --> 22:21.887
Mostly government contracts,

22:22.006 --> 22:26.058
and so we had a lot of experience with
how New York government programs work.

22:26.176 --> 22:29.511
Could you tell me about
the application in detail?

22:29.647 --> 22:33.565
Yeah, the application was a
$10,000 fee just to submit.

22:33.684 --> 22:39.187
And then, as well, $200,000
that you had to submit,

22:39.273 --> 22:41.907
but it was refundable if you
were not given the license.

22:42.026 --> 22:47.029
We expect to probably invest somewhere
between six to eight million

22:47.114 --> 22:48.530
in the startup period.

22:48.666 --> 22:51.033
Morris: <i>You know, a lot of the
biggest players right now</i>

22:51.168 --> 22:53.285
<i>are people with really
serious business backgrounds,</i>

22:53.370 --> 22:57.255
and it's made some of the people feel like
they're being pushed out of the game,

22:57.374 --> 23:00.092
that there's no room for
the mom-and-pop grower.

23:00.210 --> 23:03.879
It's definitely where
the industry is moving,

23:04.014 --> 23:05.631
is towards mass consolidation.

23:05.716 --> 23:08.634
They're gonna start buying
up licenses in other states

23:08.719 --> 23:10.602
and just consolidate
into one major brand,

23:10.721 --> 23:13.639
and so you'll start seeing that
as more states come online.

23:13.724 --> 23:16.191
Would you sell your company
if that became an opportunity?

23:16.276 --> 23:18.226
I wanna be one of
those companies.

23:18.312 --> 23:21.980
Morris: <i> Although it takes a ton of
cash to get a license in New York,</i>

23:22.066 --> 23:24.900
<i>at least there's
an application process.</i>

23:24.985 --> 23:28.570
<i>In Ohio, where legalization
was on the ballot in November,</i>

23:28.656 --> 23:32.207
<i>the corporations tried to
choose the winners in advance.</i>

23:34.411 --> 23:36.578
<i>Welcome aboard
the Green Rush Bus Tour,</i>

23:36.714 --> 23:41.416
<i>part of a campaign to convince
Ohioans to vote yes on legalization.</i>

23:41.502 --> 23:44.419
We're gonna try
and legalize marijuana.

23:50.811 --> 23:52.177
Morris:
<i>This is Buddie,</i>

23:52.262 --> 23:54.346
<i>the face of a multi-million
dollar endeavor</i>

23:54.431 --> 24:00.018
<i>designed behind closed doors to benefit
10 hand-picked investor groups.</i>

24:01.522 --> 24:04.072
<i>And as Ohio representative
Mike Curtin told us,</i>

24:04.158 --> 24:06.942
<i>a plan like this one would
set a dangerous precedent.</i>

24:07.027 --> 24:09.277
It would create a monopoly
in the state constitution

24:09.413 --> 24:15.117
by expressly giving 10 owners of
10 sites, 10 farms, essentially,

24:15.202 --> 24:18.036
the exclusive, constitutionally
sanctioned ability

24:18.122 --> 24:22.424
to grow, process, and sell
marijuana for commercial purposes.

24:22.509 --> 24:24.793
Why do you think they did this?

24:24.878 --> 24:26.628
To make a ton of money.

24:26.714 --> 24:29.131
This has no place
in the Ohio constitution.

24:29.266 --> 24:31.516
It has no place
in any state constitution.

24:31.635 --> 24:33.755
The constitution's supposed
to protect all the people.

24:33.804 --> 24:35.353
They're trying
to protect 10 guys.

24:35.472 --> 24:38.190
Morris: <i>And those 10 are
the same 10 that put in</i>

24:38.308 --> 24:40.358
<i>millions of dollars
to fund the campaign.</i>

24:40.477 --> 24:44.112
This is a tidal wave
moving so fast,

24:44.198 --> 24:47.733
it's gonna shock the world to see
what the United States just did.

24:47.818 --> 24:49.985
Morris:
<i>Alan Mooney was one of them.</i>

24:50.070 --> 24:51.653
Not one human being
on the planet Earth

24:51.789 --> 24:54.489
has ever seen a tsunami of this
magnitude moving at this speed.

24:54.625 --> 24:59.578
That's why Wall Street's still going, "It
ain't real. Oh my God, it ain't real."

24:59.663 --> 25:03.832
It's the biggest tsunami ever to hit
the world, in my lifetime, of money.

25:03.967 --> 25:07.052
What about the fact that only
10 growers can participate?

25:07.171 --> 25:09.387
People are calling it a
monopoly Oh my gosh, this is--

25:09.506 --> 25:11.306
or an oligopoly.
To the voting public of Ohio,

25:11.341 --> 25:13.558
that makes zero difference
to the voter.

25:13.677 --> 25:16.678
You know why? They want this
100% controlled and taxed.

25:16.764 --> 25:18.430
Then why are they written
into the amendment itself?

25:18.515 --> 25:21.266
Why isn't it something they
apply for like in New York?

25:21.351 --> 25:23.551
Would you rather let the
politicians make that decision?

25:23.604 --> 25:27.272
Sir? Sir? Or would you rather let
private capitalists do that?

25:29.159 --> 25:32.527
I'm a capitalist. Blue blood.
I love America. I love Ohio.

25:32.663 --> 25:35.914
I am a capitalist,
and I'm not ashamed of it.

25:36.033 --> 25:38.834
Morris: <i>The amendment became
a flash point in Ohio,</i>

25:38.919 --> 25:42.087
<i>and this time, legalization
went down hard on election day.</i>

25:42.206 --> 25:45.040
Voters here in Ohio
overwhelmingly decided against

25:45.175 --> 25:47.759
a constitutional amendment
to legalize marijuana.

25:47.878 --> 25:49.845
<i>The decision came after
months of controversy</i>

25:49.930 --> 25:53.131
<i>and debate about the group
backing the legislation.</i>

25:53.217 --> 25:54.549
Morris:
<i>But the campaign showed</i>

25:54.635 --> 25:57.185
<i>that capitalists like Mooney
are trying to call the shots</i>

25:57.221 --> 25:59.554
<i>as legalization
sweeps the country.</i>

25:59.640 --> 26:02.057
<i>Twenty-three states have
legalized medical marijuana,</i>

26:02.142 --> 26:06.228
<i>and four states plus DC have
ended prohibition entirely.</i>

26:06.313 --> 26:09.030
<i>At least 21 other states are
gearing up to do the same.</i>

26:09.116 --> 26:13.401
<i>All this has made marijuana the
fastest growing industry in America.</i>

26:13.537 --> 26:17.789
<i>And researchers predict that if
marijuana's legalized in all 50 states,</i>

26:17.908 --> 26:21.793
<i>revenue could reach
$35 billion per year.</i>

26:21.912 --> 26:24.296
<i>But just like when alcohol
prohibition ended,</i>

26:24.414 --> 26:26.081
<i>big business is dominating,</i>

26:26.166 --> 26:29.801
<i>and small farmers are still being
treated like illegal bootleggers.</i>

26:29.920 --> 26:31.753
(knocking) Sheriff's
office, search warrant!

26:31.839 --> 26:33.722
(glass shattering)
Demanding entry!

26:33.807 --> 26:37.309
Morris: <i> The Humboldt County Sheriff's
Department suspected this local farmer</i>

26:37.427 --> 26:39.227
<i>had violated state regulation,</i>

26:39.313 --> 26:41.813
<i>so they confiscated
his entire crop.</i>

26:41.932 --> 26:46.184
Profiting from the cultivation
of marijuana is illegal.

26:46.270 --> 26:51.690
<i>And it's a lot easier to cut
down, you know, 130 plants</i>

26:51.775 --> 26:53.942
<i>than it is 13,000 plants.</i>

26:54.077 --> 26:56.661
This is what was found
in this room.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.114
Each of these is
at least two pounds.

26:59.199 --> 27:02.868
Ireland: <i>Who these people are and
what kind of lives they live</i>

27:02.953 --> 27:05.253
<i>has no factor
in what I'm gonna do.</i>

27:05.339 --> 27:07.172
'Cause it's my job.

27:07.291 --> 27:11.009
Morris: <i> The property owner, who believed
he was following the letter of the law,</i>

27:11.128 --> 27:13.795
<i>returned to find his entire
garden destroyed.</i>

27:13.881 --> 27:17.382
<i>To date, Barry hasn't been
charged with any crime.</i>

27:17.467 --> 27:20.218
<i>But small farmers like him
are easy targets,</i>

27:20.304 --> 27:23.688
<i>and they're only one raid away
from financial ruin.</i>

27:23.807 --> 27:25.974
Barry: <i>I don't understand that.
Why me?</i>

27:26.059 --> 27:29.144
You know, I'm so small compared to
what these other people are doing.

27:29.229 --> 27:30.729
You know, it just doesn't
make sense to me.

27:30.814 --> 27:33.782
Morris: <i>Caught between the
machetes of law enforcement</i>

27:33.867 --> 27:35.650
<i>and the bank accounts
of businessmen,</i>

27:35.786 --> 27:39.654
<i>the small-time growers are going
to have to fight to survive.</i>

27:39.740 --> 27:44.743
I had such a dream of being able
to grow legally my whole life.

27:44.828 --> 27:47.829
We're kind of hanging on
by our fingertips,

27:47.965 --> 27:52.000
but we're gonna fight. We're gonna fight
for our place all the way to the end.

27:52.135 --> 27:54.002
Morris:
<i>Will you do it again?</i>

27:54.087 --> 27:55.337
I doubt it.

27:55.472 --> 27:59.140
I doubt it. It's just,
you know, why bother?
