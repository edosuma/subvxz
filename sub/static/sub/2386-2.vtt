WEBVTT

00:00.721 --> 00:03.766
Oh, God, guys, I'm
still really hungover.

00:03.770 --> 00:05.136
Did I really
ruin a wedding?

00:05.138 --> 00:07.505
No, you didn't ruin
a wedding.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.907
Just the reception.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.842
And the bar mitzvah next door.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.527
And my dress.

00:12.529 --> 00:14.779
And your dress. You put on
a dress at one point.

00:14.781 --> 00:17.115
Okay, you know what,
that's it.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.784
I'm about to be a dad,
and I want to be

00:19.786 --> 00:22.436
the kind of man that my
child can look up to.

00:22.438 --> 00:24.906
So, sweeping declaration--

00:24.908 --> 00:29.210
I am never getting drunk again
as long as I live.

00:29.212 --> 00:31.278
I'm serious.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.765
<i>Kids, it's not that</i>
<i>your Uncle Marshall</i>

00:33.767 --> 00:35.066
<i>had a drinking problem.</i>

00:35.068 --> 00:37.185
But whenever he made a sweeping
<i>declaration like that,</i>

00:37.187 --> 00:39.020
<i>you pretty much knew...</i>

00:40.622 --> 00:41.889
I did it again.

00:41.891 --> 00:44.175
<i>But I'm getting ahead</i>
<i>of myself.</i>

00:45.394 --> 00:47.345
What happened
to your leg?

00:47.347 --> 00:48.813
Oh, nothing.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.515
I'm meeting Nora
for coffee.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.934
She's still mad at me, so
I need some sympathy points.

00:52.936 --> 00:54.301
She likes musicals,
so I'm going

00:54.303 --> 00:55.803
to tell her I fell off the stage

00:55.805 --> 00:57.522
during a performance
of <i>Man of La Mancha.</i>

00:57.524 --> 00:58.639
What do you think?

00:58.641 --> 01:00.274
Lose the cast.

01:00.276 --> 01:02.910
A one-man show-- I like it!

01:02.912 --> 01:05.113
Just so we're clear--

01:05.114 --> 01:08.333
this woman is mad at you
because you lied to her.

01:08.335 --> 01:11.119
So your solution is to pretend
you broke your leg?

01:11.121 --> 01:13.204
You're right.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.373
A neck brace.
Thanks, Lil.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.675
Man, I wish I'd have talked
to you sooner.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.310
I've been practicing
with these crutches all day

01:19.312 --> 01:21.346
and whoever left them
in my lobby

01:21.348 --> 01:22.463
probably really
needs 'em.

01:22.465 --> 01:24.665
Well, uh, I have
some good news.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.052
As you all know, I recently
decided to get back out there

01:28.054 --> 01:30.955
and start dating again.
And, uh, well...

01:34.610 --> 01:36.627
Is this you?

01:36.629 --> 01:39.731
Uh, yeah. Hi.

01:39.733 --> 01:40.865
I'm Ted.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.133
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.285
That's great, Ted.

01:44.287 --> 01:46.187
Yeah. Yeah, it was a moment
of pure destiny.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.656
The kind you just
can't manufacture.

01:48.658 --> 01:50.691
Or so I thought.

01:53.662 --> 01:56.697
Oh, no.
How did I get on there?

01:56.699 --> 01:58.649
Hi. Ted Mosby.

01:59.501 --> 02:00.868
Guilty.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.670
Hi. Ted Mosby.

02:02.672 --> 02:04.422
That is embarrassing.

02:04.424 --> 02:08.643
I should be on the cover of
<i>Egg On My Face</i> magazine.

02:08.645 --> 02:09.844
But I'm not.

02:09.846 --> 02:11.979
I'm on the cover of this one.

02:11.981 --> 02:14.132
Hi. Ted Mosby.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.150
16 moments of pure destiny

02:16.152 --> 02:18.853
in one day,
and of those 16,

02:18.855 --> 02:20.938
ten were single.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.108
Of those ten,
seven liked what they saw.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.760
Of those seven,

02:25.762 --> 02:27.728
four were women.

02:27.730 --> 02:30.081
Of those four,

02:30.083 --> 02:31.365
two gave me their real number.

02:31.367 --> 02:34.168
And I have a date
with both of them.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.953
Okay.

02:37.706 --> 02:39.006
Guys,

02:39.008 --> 02:40.641
it's Garrison Cootes.

02:40.643 --> 02:42.593
<i>Kids, Garrison Cootes</i>
<i>was a senior partner</i>

02:42.595 --> 02:44.245
<i>at Honeywell & Cootes.</i>

02:44.247 --> 02:45.797
<i>One of the biggest</i>
<i>environmental law firms</i>

02:45.799 --> 02:47.231
<i>in America.</i>

02:47.233 --> 02:49.300
<i>Marshall would have given</i>
<i>anything to work there.</i>

02:49.302 --> 02:51.636
If I don't get this job,
I might end up working

02:51.638 --> 02:52.854
at, like, a Taco Bell somewhere.

02:52.856 --> 02:54.355
And nobody wants that.

02:54.357 --> 02:57.041
Or maybe you guys want that,
because you'll get free tacos,

02:57.043 --> 02:58.392
'cause your my peeps.

02:58.394 --> 03:01.813
But right now I need
all of you to calm down!

03:03.099 --> 03:05.533
Hello.

03:05.535 --> 03:07.201
Marshall, this is
Garrison Cootes.

03:07.203 --> 03:09.036
Sorry I didn't get back
to you sooner,

03:09.038 --> 03:11.239
but I've just been swamped.

03:12.575 --> 03:15.276
Which is funny,
'cause I'm literally

03:15.278 --> 03:17.078
standing in a swamp.

03:18.915 --> 03:22.083
Anyway, I'm just out here,
I'm just collecting some samples

03:22.085 --> 03:24.285
for this pollution case
we're working on.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.254
I love the work you guys do.
That's a croc...

03:26.256 --> 03:27.306
No, I mean it.

03:27.331 --> 03:29.768
No, no, there's a crocodile
about five feet away from me.

03:29.893 --> 03:31.309
So I'm just going to ignore

03:31.311 --> 03:33.561
the hot urine filling
my waders as we speak,

03:33.563 --> 03:35.963
and tell you that
we're very interested.

03:35.965 --> 03:36.964
He's interested.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.649
Obviously we have
to do some sort

03:38.651 --> 03:40.935
of credit check, you know,
a criminal record

03:40.937 --> 03:43.571
and Google search, but as long
as nothing unseemly turns up,

03:43.573 --> 03:44.939
you're good to go, man.

03:44.941 --> 03:46.858
That is fantastic, Mr. Cootes!

03:46.860 --> 03:48.242
Well, I gotta run.

03:49.913 --> 03:51.445
This is so funny,

03:51.447 --> 03:55.249
because, actually, I physically
have to run now.

03:55.251 --> 03:58.499
- Croc saw you?
- He's advancing, yeah.

<i>Thankfully, without</i>

04:16.572 --> 04:19.607
Hey, Nora, thanks
for meeting me here.

04:19.608 --> 04:20.757
What happened to your neck?

04:20.760 --> 04:23.177
My wha...? Oh, it's nothing.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.513
I was performing in
a one-man show of <i>Fiddler.</i>

04:26.515 --> 04:28.282
There was this roof.

04:28.284 --> 04:30.501
Wow, that one has
fantastic ta-tas.

04:30.503 --> 04:31.652
What, where?

04:31.654 --> 04:32.870
Oh... Oh, damn it.

04:32.872 --> 04:34.005
Ta-ta.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.190
Wait, Nora, wait...
No, look, please don't.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.191
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.593
What is the matter with you?

04:38.595 --> 04:40.628
What kind of person
needs to lie like that.

04:40.630 --> 04:43.364
A person who really,
really likes you.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.633
And suspects,
probably accurately,

04:45.635 --> 04:47.218
that you're way
out of his league,

04:47.220 --> 04:49.470
and so he feels the need to...

04:51.089 --> 04:52.673
I'm sorry, you were kidding

04:52.675 --> 04:54.058
about the fantastic
ta-tas, right?

04:54.060 --> 04:55.198
'Cause I'm looking around
and I do not see 'em...

04:58.264 --> 05:00.064
I just had two
back-to-back dates.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.733
That's right,
two lovely ladies,

05:02.735 --> 05:06.737
four large cappuccinos,
and... one sec.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.908
And I don't know which
date was more awesome.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.577
Let's meet the girls.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.862
<i>Jessica is a Rhodes scholar.</i>

05:14.864 --> 05:16.397
<i>She's traveled</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

05:16.399 --> 05:19.066
<i>Speaks four languages,</i>
<i>is a concert pianist.</i>

05:19.068 --> 05:22.853
<i>And Claire reached</i>
<i>for the check.</i>

05:22.855 --> 05:23.971
So I don't know.

05:23.973 --> 05:25.306
It's a squeaker.

05:25.308 --> 05:26.574
I mean, both
of these girls

05:26.576 --> 05:29.427
have the potential to be
something really special.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.381
They both move
on to the next round.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.364
Wait a minute.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.382
You're going to date
two girls at once?

05:34.384 --> 05:36.133
Don't you think you should
just choose one

05:36.135 --> 05:37.268
before it gets serious?

05:37.270 --> 05:38.352
Define serious.

05:38.354 --> 05:40.087
Well, that's complicated.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.473
I guess you have to weigh
expectations,

05:42.475 --> 05:43.724
emotional investments...

05:43.726 --> 05:44.992
Third base.

05:44.994 --> 05:46.394
Seriously, third base.

05:46.396 --> 05:48.863
So I can go to second base with
both of these girls, no problem?

05:48.865 --> 05:51.082
Oh, honk away, my friend.
Yeah, honk away.

05:51.766 --> 05:53.317
Oh, no.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.519
Ever since Mr. Cootes mentioned
<i>the background check,</i>

05:55.521 --> 05:57.588
<i>Marshall had been</i>
<i>scouring the Internet.</i>

05:57.590 --> 06:00.041
<i>Most of what he found</i>
<i>was pretty harmless.</i>

06:00.043 --> 06:03.277
<i>In some cases,</i>
<i>really awesome, until...</i>

06:03.279 --> 06:04.412
Not good.

06:04.414 --> 06:06.914
This-- this is not good.

06:07.782 --> 06:09.383
Thanks, Stacy.

06:09.385 --> 06:11.636
Wesleyan has a new cafeteria,

06:11.638 --> 06:13.587
thanks to the generous
endowment from--

06:13.589 --> 06:14.972
Oh, ho-ho!

06:14.974 --> 06:18.175
Did somebody say
generous endowment?

06:18.177 --> 06:24.815
I'm Marshall Eriksen, but you
can call me Beercules!

06:32.157 --> 06:34.641
Well, that could
be anybody.

06:38.306 --> 06:41.185
Oh, man, I forgot
about Beercules.

06:41.790 --> 06:43.623
Who made this
Web site anyway?

06:43.625 --> 06:46.068
- Pete Durkenson.
- Of course.

06:46.069 --> 06:49.213
Is that the guy who convinced
you to run across campus naked?

06:49.214 --> 06:51.131
I was pledging his frat,

06:51.133 --> 06:53.216
which I gave up on
after three days,

06:53.218 --> 06:55.702
because frats are stupid
and elitist

06:55.704 --> 06:58.204
and also I found out
he wasn't in a frat.

06:58.206 --> 07:00.256
Oh, my God.

07:00.258 --> 07:01.558
This is awesome.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.277
I just got invited
to the Architects' Ball,

07:04.279 --> 07:07.730
the annual gala that honors
the city's greatest architects.

07:07.732 --> 07:10.900
Oh, no, you guys see
why this sucks, right?

07:10.902 --> 07:12.569
Because it's an annual gala

07:12.571 --> 07:14.154
honoring the city's
greatest architects?

07:14.156 --> 07:17.874
Robin, this is the social event
of the year.

07:17.876 --> 07:20.243
You take a girl
to the Architects' Ball,

07:20.245 --> 07:22.612
brother, you're going
to third base.

07:22.614 --> 07:23.913
Whichever girl

07:23.915 --> 07:25.415
I take as my date,

07:25.417 --> 07:28.334
she will be
Miss Ted Mosby's girlfriend

07:28.336 --> 07:29.903
by the end of the night.

07:31.038 --> 07:32.922
Okay, no more sitting
on the fence.

07:32.924 --> 07:35.091
Robin, get me my legal pad.

07:35.093 --> 07:37.093
It's pros and cons time!

07:38.563 --> 07:41.698
And kids, they really cheered.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.983
Let me make one thing
very clear to you.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.953
I don't date guys who lie to me.

07:46.955 --> 07:49.155
Well, see, I did not
know that.

07:49.157 --> 07:50.306
My bad.

07:50.308 --> 07:52.275
So, from here on in,
no more lies.

07:52.277 --> 07:55.178
I will never lie
to you again.

07:56.013 --> 07:57.614
I'm serious. Ask me anything.

07:57.616 --> 08:00.049
Okay.

08:00.051 --> 08:01.117
Have you ever successfully

08:01.119 --> 08:03.503
gotten a woman in bed
by lying to her?

08:03.505 --> 08:06.122
Have I ever...

08:08.792 --> 08:12.712
If I'm being totally honest...

08:14.765 --> 08:16.216
Yes.

08:16.218 --> 08:18.134
More than once?

08:18.136 --> 08:20.470
More than once...

08:20.472 --> 08:22.555
Wow, that's...

08:24.526 --> 08:27.560
I guess if we're
splitting hairs,

08:27.562 --> 08:31.397
then, technically...
there was a plurality

08:31.399 --> 08:35.702
to the times I've lied to women
for sex having purposes.

08:35.703 --> 08:36.919
What were they?

08:36.922 --> 08:38.922
Nines and tens mostly.

08:38.924 --> 08:40.573
There was a four once.

08:40.575 --> 08:41.957
She was a slump buster.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.578
But, Nora, after that, I had a
run that you would not believe.

08:45.580 --> 08:48.047
Man, honesty feels good.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.732
What were the lies?

08:49.734 --> 08:52.335
You want me to tell you every
lie I've ever told a woman

08:52.337 --> 08:53.503
to get her into bed?

08:53.505 --> 08:56.222
A bed or any other place
you had sex with her.

08:56.224 --> 08:57.457
Oh, you're good.

08:58.627 --> 09:00.810
Pete, Pete. Hey.

09:00.812 --> 09:02.929
Beercules!

09:02.931 --> 09:04.213
Bring it in, dude.

09:04.215 --> 09:06.349
Hey, I've been
trying to call you,

09:06.351 --> 09:07.717
like, all night.

09:07.719 --> 09:08.985
Oh, my God, sorry.

09:08.987 --> 09:10.987
I would have answered,
but it is Tuesday night.

09:10.989 --> 09:11.821
It's Sunday.

09:11.823 --> 09:13.606
And you know what that means.

09:13.608 --> 09:15.692
"Edward Forty Hands."

09:15.694 --> 09:17.760
<i>Kids, "Edward Forty Hands"</i>

09:17.762 --> 09:20.230
is a game that involves taping
<i>two 40-ounce bottles</i>

09:20.232 --> 09:22.565
<i>of malt liquor to your hands.</i>

09:22.567 --> 09:24.300
<i>The object is to finish</i>
<i>both bottle--</i>

09:24.302 --> 09:26.202
<i>Oh, my God, why am</i>
<i>I telling you this?</i>

09:26.204 --> 09:27.370
<i>Let's move on.</i>

09:27.372 --> 09:30.906
Okay, you know that old video
of me streaking?

09:30.908 --> 09:33.075
I watch it every day.

09:33.077 --> 09:35.929
Well, I need you to take it down
off the Internet.

09:35.931 --> 09:37.347
Like, right now.

09:37.349 --> 09:39.081
There are two ways
that can happen.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.217
One, you can give me
$4 million,

09:41.219 --> 09:44.437
or... you can help me
go to the bathroom,

09:44.439 --> 09:45.939
because I... I can't...

09:45.941 --> 09:49.809
Yeah, those are two
non-negotiable no's.

09:49.811 --> 09:51.778
Well, I'm sorry we could not
do business together.

09:51.780 --> 09:53.062
But if you'll excuse me,

09:53.064 --> 09:55.448
I'm in the middle of a game
of "Edward Forty Hands,"

09:55.450 --> 09:57.533
and the competition is fierce.

09:57.535 --> 10:00.269
Who are you
playing with, anyway?

10:00.271 --> 10:03.439
Just myself.

10:03.441 --> 10:06.042
<i>Meanwhile, Barney continued</i>
<i>listing every lie</i>

10:06.044 --> 10:07.293
<i>he'd ever told to get laid.</i>

10:07.295 --> 10:09.729
There's no time to explain
how I got bit there.

10:09.731 --> 10:11.864
I just need someone
to suck the poison out.

10:11.866 --> 10:14.033
The surgeons gave me a new face,

10:14.035 --> 10:15.051
honey.

10:15.053 --> 10:16.686
Aren't you relieved I'm alive?

10:16.688 --> 10:19.422
<i>Me llamo David Beckham.</i>

10:19.424 --> 10:22.208
If I were
only casting <i>The White Swan</i>

10:22.210 --> 10:23.509
the role would be yours.

10:23.511 --> 10:25.712
No, I am a lesbian.

10:25.714 --> 10:28.615
This thing that I'm wearing
is just really lifelike.

10:28.617 --> 10:30.350
Okay, let's skip ahead.

10:30.352 --> 10:31.484
What's the worst one?

10:31.486 --> 10:32.769
The lowest of the low?

10:32.771 --> 10:34.187
The creme de la creepy?

10:34.189 --> 10:37.991
Uh... Oh, I once pulled
<i>The Soul Man.</i>

10:37.993 --> 10:41.327
There was this beautiful girl
who only dated black guys...

10:41.329 --> 10:45.131
Barnell!
Ooh, I knew it!

10:47.001 --> 10:49.335
I can't decide.

10:49.337 --> 10:50.837
They're both awesome.

10:50.839 --> 10:53.640
If only architects had
two balls, right, Ted?

10:53.642 --> 10:55.508
I got this.

10:55.510 --> 10:57.010
Ted, left or right?

10:57.012 --> 10:58.327
Yes, yes, great idea.

10:58.329 --> 10:59.962
Let the fates decide, huh?

10:59.964 --> 11:02.115
I will pick left.

11:02.117 --> 11:03.299
Just call one of 'em.

11:03.301 --> 11:04.300
Ugh!

11:04.302 --> 11:05.635
Ted, deep in your heart,

11:05.637 --> 11:07.937
you know that you
kind of like one

11:07.939 --> 11:08.805
more than the other.

11:08.807 --> 11:10.306
Trust me-- take the other.

11:10.308 --> 11:13.309
Um, maybe I haven't
this is...

11:13.311 --> 11:15.678
the Architects'
Ball, Robin.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.779
It's a star-studded event.

11:16.781 --> 11:19.014
Okay, name one celebrity
who's gonna be there.

11:19.016 --> 11:20.349
Uh... Lenny Kravitz.

11:20.351 --> 11:21.801
Lenny Kravitz is gonna be there?

11:21.803 --> 11:23.236
Yeah.
He's there every year.

11:23.238 --> 11:24.454
And that guy's a rock star.

11:24.456 --> 11:27.707
You know, Ted,
I've been thinking--

11:27.709 --> 11:30.877
it's too soon to narrow it down
between these two girls.

11:30.879 --> 11:31.994
Just take a friend.

11:31.996 --> 11:34.831
Like I... I don't know,
maybe, uh, a friend

11:34.833 --> 11:38.000
who had a poster of
Lenny Kravitz on her wall,

11:38.002 --> 11:40.720
and may or may not
have, perhaps,

11:40.722 --> 11:43.656
dated that poster, on and off,
throughout high school.

11:44.725 --> 11:47.376
This pros and cons list
isn't cutting it.

11:48.979 --> 11:50.713
I need a color chart.

11:51.682 --> 11:52.932
Color chart! Color chart!

11:52.934 --> 11:56.335
<i>And, kids,</i>
<i>we all really chanted.</i>

11:56.337 --> 11:57.353
Pete, please.

11:57.355 --> 11:59.155
I'm unemployed.

11:59.157 --> 12:00.440
I have a huge mortgage.

12:00.442 --> 12:01.941
I have a baby on the way.

12:01.943 --> 12:04.694
And now, I'm about
to lose a job I really need

12:04.696 --> 12:06.579
because of a 15-year-old prank!

12:06.581 --> 12:08.114
Ugh! Do you hear yourself?

12:08.116 --> 12:09.582
Beercules, what happened?

12:09.584 --> 12:10.817
You're like a different person.

12:11.785 --> 12:13.669
The guy in that video
was awesome.

12:13.671 --> 12:16.255
He had potential.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.541
He could have been president of
the frat one day.

12:18.543 --> 12:20.209
There was no frat!

12:20.211 --> 12:21.377
Now he's just a bummer.

12:21.379 --> 12:23.579
It's not like I want
to be a bummer.

12:23.581 --> 12:26.099
I just... I have to be.

12:26.101 --> 12:27.583
I'm gonna be a dad.

12:27.585 --> 12:28.851
You'll have kids someday.

12:28.853 --> 12:29.969
You'll understand.

12:29.971 --> 12:32.588
Dude, I have four kids.

12:32.590 --> 12:35.758
Pete, please take
the video down.

12:36.777 --> 12:38.778
All right, Beercules,
I'll take the video down.

12:38.780 --> 12:40.229
If...

12:40.231 --> 12:43.316
you can best me in
a game of my own choosing.

12:43.318 --> 12:44.567
Oh, no...

12:44.569 --> 12:47.036
And I select the beautiful game,

12:47.038 --> 12:48.270
the sweet science...

12:48.272 --> 12:50.072
Pete, please,
I'm so hungover...

12:50.074 --> 12:51.157
...the sport of kings...

12:51.159 --> 12:53.126
I don't want to play
"Edward Forty Hands."

12:53.128 --> 12:54.276
I was gonna say darts--

12:54.278 --> 12:57.079
but "Edward Forty
Hands" it is!

12:57.081 --> 12:59.882
And that concludes all
the space-related lies.

12:59.884 --> 13:02.585
Let's move on to
the world of sports.

13:02.587 --> 13:05.555
Oh, wait, sorry-- I just thought
of another space one.

13:05.557 --> 13:07.890
"I've been bitten
by a moon snake.

13:07.892 --> 13:10.459
You need to suck all the
space poison out of my--"

13:10.461 --> 13:12.145
Okay, Barney, uh,

13:12.147 --> 13:13.679
I have to be at work
tomorrow at 8:00,

13:13.681 --> 13:15.348
which means I have
just about enough time

13:15.350 --> 13:17.750
to sit in a shower for 11 hours,
hugging myself.

13:20.087 --> 13:21.237
So this was fun.

13:21.239 --> 13:22.455
Can I call you, or...?

13:22.457 --> 13:25.608
Barney, you're funny, handsome

13:25.610 --> 13:27.276
and really quite clever.

13:27.278 --> 13:29.445
But you're also a sociopath.

13:29.447 --> 13:31.347
Well, I count three pros
and one con, so...

13:31.349 --> 13:33.833
How do you still think
you have a chance with me?

13:33.835 --> 13:36.169
Because you sat
here all night.

13:36.171 --> 13:38.321
You could've left right
away, but you didn't.

13:39.289 --> 13:43.759
Look, Nora, all those lies--
that's the old me.

13:43.761 --> 13:46.562
But I swear to you,
I am trying to change.

13:46.564 --> 13:50.466
You... make me want to change.

13:50.468 --> 13:53.352
How do I know that's not a lie?

13:53.354 --> 13:55.071
I'll prove it.

13:55.073 --> 13:56.939
I will prove how serious I am.

13:56.941 --> 13:59.675
I will not leave this diner

13:59.677 --> 14:02.879
until I get
a second date with you.

14:03.981 --> 14:05.198
Good-bye, Barney.

14:05.649 --> 14:07.033
I'm not kidding.

14:07.035 --> 14:08.484
This is a 24-hour diner.

14:08.486 --> 14:12.121
I'll stay here forever,
if I have to-- and I will!

14:13.991 --> 14:15.691
Just water for me. Thanks.

14:18.194 --> 14:20.997
Okay, so red indicates
level of attractiveness,

14:20.999 --> 14:23.466
blue--
intellectual stimulation,

14:23.468 --> 14:25.051
green-- emotional connection,

14:25.053 --> 14:27.703
yellow-- compatibility
of life goals,

14:27.705 --> 14:31.206
and purple-- whether or not
she reached for the check.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.643
Well, it looks like
Jessica's ahead

14:33.645 --> 14:35.711
in the first
four categories.

14:36.881 --> 14:40.416
Did not reach for the check...

14:42.853 --> 14:44.053
Oh, this?

14:45.222 --> 14:46.722
No big deal. This...

14:46.724 --> 14:48.357
This cost three
months rent,

14:48.359 --> 14:50.026
and, uh, I've never
gotten to wear it,

14:50.028 --> 14:52.862
because I bought it for that big
event that you invited me to,

14:52.864 --> 14:54.396
which then fell through.

14:54.398 --> 14:55.831
But, you know what?

14:55.833 --> 14:57.450
Don't feel guilty about that.

14:57.452 --> 14:58.417
What big event?

14:58.419 --> 14:59.568
That thing with your uncle.

14:59.570 --> 15:01.354
His funeral?

15:02.089 --> 15:03.205
It didn't fall through,

15:03.207 --> 15:04.707
he miraculously
came out of a coma.

15:04.709 --> 15:06.509
And I forgive you.

15:06.511 --> 15:09.095
Now, can I please
meet Lenny Kravitz?

15:12.415 --> 15:13.883
I did it again!

15:13.885 --> 15:15.801
Aw, honey.

15:15.803 --> 15:17.086
You got drunk again.

15:17.088 --> 15:19.722
I can't believe
I took the over.

15:19.724 --> 15:24.193
Just to be clear, "I did it
again" is not a reference...

15:24.195 --> 15:26.762
to my current state of
inebriation.

15:26.764 --> 15:28.931
What's it a reference to?

15:28.933 --> 15:30.900
My name is Marshall Eriksen.

15:30.902 --> 15:32.885
I'm 33 years old.

15:32.887 --> 15:37.957
And if my potential future
employer, Garrison Cootes,

15:37.959 --> 15:40.442
is watching this...

15:40.444 --> 15:43.129
bow down to Beercules!

15:50.087 --> 15:51.921
Well, that could
be anybody.

15:57.363 --> 15:58.695
Oh, goodness.

16:06.077 --> 16:07.986
Pete, this is Lily Aldrin.

16:07.987 --> 16:09.720
I'm gonna make this real simple:

16:09.722 --> 16:11.572
You're gonna take down
that video of Marshall.

16:11.574 --> 16:12.973
You know why?

16:12.975 --> 16:16.026
Because I'm friends with three
girls who dated you in college,

16:16.028 --> 16:18.528
and girls
tell each other everything.

16:18.530 --> 16:21.215
Every <i>tiny</i> detail.

16:21.217 --> 16:22.533
Huh. So...

16:22.535 --> 16:27.888
tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes
the little wee-wee clock.

16:28.757 --> 16:29.873
Pete's got a little wee-wee?

16:29.875 --> 16:31.592
No idea.
What's everyone getting?

16:31.594 --> 16:34.762
This was bound to
happen eventually.

16:34.764 --> 16:37.731
I've been trying so hard
to suppress, like,

16:37.733 --> 16:39.383
my carefree idiot side,

16:39.385 --> 16:43.220
that it just rebelled
and came out swingin'!

16:43.222 --> 16:44.388
It sure did.

16:44.390 --> 16:46.774
Look at me! I'm a windmill!

16:46.776 --> 16:49.944
Who am I kidding?
I'm not ready to be a dad.

16:49.946 --> 16:52.780
I thought that I was,
but it's, like...

16:52.782 --> 16:55.916
my dad never did stuff
like that, you know?

16:55.918 --> 16:57.401
So what if he did?

16:57.403 --> 16:59.286
You'd still love him.

16:59.288 --> 17:02.923
And be honest-- wouldn't you
love to stumble onto a video

17:02.925 --> 17:05.442
of him running down
the street naked, yelling,

17:05.444 --> 17:07.176
"Hey, Marshall, look at me!

17:07.179 --> 17:09.696
I got an icicle on my deal!"

17:13.935 --> 17:15.219
Oh! Hey, guys!

17:15.221 --> 17:16.920
Ow! My neck!

17:16.922 --> 17:19.390
Uh... oh! Hey!

17:19.392 --> 17:20.808
Look at that.

17:20.810 --> 17:23.426
Barney, what are
you doing here?

17:23.429 --> 17:26.530
Oh, I told Nora I wouldn't leave
until she gave me a second date,

17:26.531 --> 17:27.815
and I mean it.

17:27.817 --> 17:29.266
I've already been here
nine hours.

17:29.268 --> 17:32.036
I still need
another minute.

17:32.038 --> 17:35.289
I mean... call me crazy, but

17:35.291 --> 17:37.891
I'm gonna stay here until
I get that girl back.

17:40.611 --> 17:43.797
That-- that's
what I want.

17:44.716 --> 17:46.300
The way Barney
feels about Nora--

17:46.302 --> 17:47.951
I want that feeling again.

17:48.953 --> 17:50.838
I don't want to be choosing
between two girls,

17:50.840 --> 17:55.642
I want to be... a complete
head-over-heels idiot for one.

17:55.644 --> 17:57.728
Yeah, the complete
head-over-heels idiot thing's

17:57.730 --> 17:59.897
pretty nice.

18:00.982 --> 18:02.316
It's not bad.

18:02.318 --> 18:05.102
Although, for the record--

18:05.104 --> 18:08.572
sweeping declaration!--

18:08.574 --> 18:13.494
I am never getting
drunk again.

18:14.413 --> 18:16.430
<i>And sure enough...</i>

18:16.432 --> 18:18.332
All hail Beercules!

18:19.719 --> 18:21.018
Yeah!

18:21.020 --> 18:23.704
<i>But, again,</i>
<i>I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

18:32.847 --> 18:34.014
Hello.

18:34.016 --> 18:36.166
Marshall! Garrison Cootes.

18:36.168 --> 18:37.334
Yes, Mr. Cootes.

18:37.336 --> 18:38.652
Hi. How are you?

18:38.654 --> 18:40.604
I just wanted to let you know,
we did the background check,

18:40.606 --> 18:43.307
and that is
some disturbing streaking.

18:43.309 --> 18:45.109
Sir, th-th-the thing is, um...

18:45.111 --> 18:47.177
The rainbow streaking
in this sample

18:47.179 --> 18:49.029
is definitely
from chemical runoff.

18:49.031 --> 18:51.181
Oh, I...

18:51.183 --> 18:54.184
Bottom line-- we'd love to have
you on board.

18:54.186 --> 18:55.202
That is fantastic!

18:55.204 --> 18:57.354
Thank you, Mr. Cootes!

18:57.356 --> 18:58.355
Well, you're welcome.

18:58.357 --> 19:00.157
And-- oh, and when
you're at the office,

19:00.159 --> 19:02.409
try to wear some clothes,
okay, Beercules?

19:04.747 --> 19:06.046
Wow! That's a big snake.

19:06.048 --> 19:07.214
Oh, there's
a snake in the swamp?

19:07.216 --> 19:08.665
No, I'm talking about
your penis.

19:08.667 --> 19:09.983
See you tomorrow.

19:11.536 --> 19:12.419
I got the job.

19:12.421 --> 19:13.870
Yay!

19:13.872 --> 19:16.306
And I think that my boss
already sexually harassed me.

19:16.308 --> 19:18.892
But he saw the video
and he doesn't care!

19:18.894 --> 19:21.812
See that? Maybe Beercules
isn't so bad after all.

19:21.814 --> 19:22.763
Yeah.

19:24.150 --> 19:25.215
Hello?

19:25.217 --> 19:27.734
Hey, Marshall,
my name is Pete Durkenson.

19:27.736 --> 19:29.153
We went to Wesleyan together.

19:29.155 --> 19:30.404
Yeah, no, I know.

19:30.406 --> 19:32.606
Pete, we... we just
hung out yesterday.

19:32.608 --> 19:34.825
All right, now Lily's message
makes a little more sense.

19:34.827 --> 19:37.361
Listen, don't worry, bro,
I'm gonna take down the video.

19:37.363 --> 19:38.579
You know what?

19:38.581 --> 19:40.063
Leave it up.

19:40.065 --> 19:41.832
Whatever you say, Beercules.

19:44.786 --> 19:46.703
Scalpel.

19:46.705 --> 19:48.922
You know what?
This is good.

19:48.924 --> 19:51.341
I want our kid to see
every side of who I am.

19:51.343 --> 19:52.593
Yeah.

19:52.595 --> 19:54.077
Even the side that runs through

19:54.079 --> 19:56.196
the East Village hangin' brain.

19:57.765 --> 19:59.133
I'm gonna call Pete back.

19:59.135 --> 20:00.551
That's a good idea.

20:00.553 --> 20:03.753
<i>That evening, I took</i>
<i>Robin to the Architects' Ball.</i>

20:03.755 --> 20:05.439
Thanks again for
taking me to this.

20:05.441 --> 20:06.473
Mm. My pleasure.

20:06.475 --> 20:07.774
And, you know, you might
find it interesting.

20:07.776 --> 20:09.893
Some of these guys represent the
living history of New York--

20:09.895 --> 20:11.261
Yeah, yeah.
Where's Lenny Kravitz?

20:11.263 --> 20:12.929
Right there.

20:12.931 --> 20:16.783
Leonard Kravitz,
world-renowned architect.

20:16.785 --> 20:19.036
Guy's a rock star.

20:19.038 --> 20:20.654
He's gonna be
giving his famous

20:20.656 --> 20:22.039
90-minute lecture
on crossbeams.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.540
Well, great.

20:23.542 --> 20:25.826
I'm gonna go find one
and hang myself from it.

20:25.828 --> 20:27.244
Okay.

20:27.246 --> 20:30.130
<i>Kids, you can't talk</i>
<i>yourself into falling in love.</i>

20:30.132 --> 20:32.949
<i>It doesn't take days</i>
<i>of deliberation.</i>

20:32.951 --> 20:36.503
<i>When it's real,</i>
<i>you know pretty quickly,</i>

20:36.505 --> 20:39.789

20:41.059 --> 20:43.627
<i>I had forgotten that.</i>

20:43.629 --> 20:45.979
But I was about to be reminded.
