00:01.100 --> 00:02.852
<i>Previously, on "Casual"...</i>

00:02.878 --> 00:05.030
My brother made breakfast
for my one-night stand.

00:05.055 --> 00:07.110
Morning, Val. Just in time,
get 'em while they're hot.

00:07.135 --> 00:09.359
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:09.360 --> 00:11.309
Um, lots of things.

00:11.310 --> 00:13.279
Mom's gonna be so pissed.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.449
- You're grounded.
- What?

00:14.450 --> 00:16.349
I think she was talking to me.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.249
Oh. Still.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.359
I have a sister.
We're not honest about anything.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.319
Hmm, who do you share
the intimate details

00:22.320 --> 00:23.449
of your life with then?

00:23.450 --> 00:25.319
Nobody.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.409
<i>The thing with Val is she's just now</i>

00:26.410 --> 00:28.289
<i>getting back into the dating scene.</i>

00:28.290 --> 00:29.389
Where are you going?

00:29.390 --> 00:31.249
Shut up.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.229
We lasted 16 years,
raised a daughter together,

00:34.230 --> 00:38.239
and then a month ago
he left me for a younger woman.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.309
That sucks.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.389
I loved you, Val,

00:40.390 --> 00:43.289
and I loved our marriage, and I wish

00:43.290 --> 00:45.399
that we could have worked
things out, but we didn't.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.459
<i>Your mother told me about how</i>

00:46.460 --> 00:48.309
your depression got the best of you.

00:48.310 --> 00:49.459
Maybe I'm not supposed to be happy.

00:49.460 --> 00:51.279
I'm sorry I wasn't here
in your moment of need.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.379
You could've called, Dad.

00:52.380 --> 00:54.359
Laura, dear, how are things at school?

00:54.360 --> 00:56.269
It's been a few weeks since I've gone.

00:56.270 --> 00:57.389
What was that?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.329
Oh, just seems like
such a poisonous environment.

00:59.330 --> 01:01.439
What do you do with your spare time?

01:01.440 --> 01:03.419
I started a website
that's kind of taking off.

01:03.420 --> 01:06.239
<i>- What's the site?
- Snooger.com.</i>

01:06.240 --> 01:07.329
You use your own dating site?

01:07.330 --> 01:08.409
<i>I wrote the matching algorithm.</i>

01:08.410 --> 01:10.319
<i>And does that algorithm match you</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:11.439
<i>with any girl you find attractive?</i>

01:11.440 --> 01:13.259
<i>Pretty much.</i>

01:13.260 --> 01:14.369
Emmy.

01:14.370 --> 01:16.279
<i>I had a really nice time tonight.</i>

01:16.280 --> 01:19.369
<i>I mean, it just felt right.</i>

01:19.370 --> 01:21.350
<i>I don't want to be alone.</i>

01:26.240 --> 01:27.409
<i>I slept with Emmy.</i>

01:27.410 --> 01:30.429
Wait! Wait, Alex!

01:30.430 --> 01:32.249
Alex's girlfriend Emmy.

01:32.250 --> 01:35.309
That's... that's fucked up.

01:35.310 --> 01:37.249
I mean, we were good together.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.289
We were good together.

01:39.290 --> 01:40.350
But you should go.

01:42.350 --> 01:44.389
God, you... okay.

01:44.390 --> 01:46.430
Yeah, we deserve each other.

02:24.270 --> 02:27.260
Come on.

03:12.270 --> 03:13.389
Hello.

03:13.390 --> 03:16.370
Morning.

03:18.370 --> 03:20.329
Oh.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.329
Ugh, no.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.419
It's, like,
95% of the ingredients are fine,

03:25.420 --> 03:28.449
and then you get one moldy peach
or, like, a bad raspberry,

03:28.450 --> 03:31.319
Suddenly the whole smoothie
tastes rotten.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.279
Where are you going?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.349
I gotta get my run in by 7:00
if I'm gonna make yoga at 8:00.

03:35.350 --> 03:37.369
Oh, you have a yoga appointment?

03:37.370 --> 03:39.389
- Yeah, Kai is teaching.
- Kai?

03:39.390 --> 03:41.349
It's a common name
in the yoga community.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.369
You hate exercise.

03:43.370 --> 03:45.289
You know, I'm kind of
trying to distance myself

03:45.290 --> 03:49.299
from that word, hate,
verbally and emotionally.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.259
How's that working for you?

03:51.260 --> 03:53.299
Eh, so far, happiness is kind of boring,

03:53.300 --> 03:55.289
but I'm only on phase three.

03:55.290 --> 03:57.329
- There's phases?
- Of the breakup.

03:57.330 --> 03:59.419
Phase one is drinking, drugs, and women.

03:59.420 --> 04:01.269
That phase is my favorite.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.429
That's a shocker. Phase two?

04:03.430 --> 04:06.329
Wallowing in self pity.
Sorry about that, by the way.

04:06.330 --> 04:11.250
But now, phase three, self improvement.

04:12.310 --> 04:14.409
That sounds... great.

04:14.410 --> 04:16.269
It's distracting,

04:16.269 --> 04:18.329
and distraction is
the universal human motivator.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.450
All right, I gotta go.

04:22.370 --> 04:24.320
No, still bad.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.449
Why is everyone up?

04:32.450 --> 04:35.409
Oh, sorry.

04:35.410 --> 04:37.239
Go back to bed.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.832
Enjoy your last day before school.

04:38.857 --> 04:41.837
Yeah. I'm not going back to school.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.419
Serena, I have to ask.

04:53.420 --> 04:56.459
What scares you so much
about spirituality?

04:56.460 --> 04:59.429
The whole thing is
so crazy and inappropriate.

04:59.430 --> 05:01.369
Asking you to come to a seder?

05:01.370 --> 05:03.449
I don't want to join her cult.

05:03.450 --> 05:05.239
Okay.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.299
That's what it is, a cult,

05:06.300 --> 05:08.229
and she wants me to drink the Kool-Aid.

05:08.230 --> 05:11.269
So her family is orthodox?

05:11.270 --> 05:13.309
No, they're not that bad.

05:13.310 --> 05:15.289
Serena, it feels like you have

05:15.290 --> 05:17.389
a pretty strong aversion
to all things God.

05:17.390 --> 05:19.369
No, I have an aversion to cults,

05:19.370 --> 05:21.429
and I just don't want her
bringing it into our home,

05:21.430 --> 05:24.449
and I found a book of spells
on the bookshelf.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.269
A book of spells?

05:27.270 --> 05:29.259
The Old Testament.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.419
Uh, well...

05:30.420 --> 05:32.429
You know, it sounds like
it means something to her

05:32.430 --> 05:34.330
and she's trying to include you.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.249
Talk to me.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.339
About what?

05:51.340 --> 05:52.449
I don't know, just say things to help me

05:52.450 --> 05:55.289
ignore the horrible thoughts
inside my head.

05:55.290 --> 05:57.279
Okay, uh...

05:57.280 --> 05:59.359
what if global warming
destroys our entire planet

05:59.360 --> 06:02.420
and we're all fighting
with each other for clean water?

06:04.380 --> 06:06.359
Good God.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.359
Uh... thanks.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.379
Laura's not going back to school.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.380
Oh.

06:12.381 --> 06:14.439
Alex started exercising.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.279
That's good.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.449
- No, it's a cry for help.
- Okay.

06:17.450 --> 06:19.339
He's looking for the root
of his problems,

06:19.340 --> 06:21.299
and eventually, he's gonna look to me.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.429
Because of Emmy.

06:22.430 --> 06:24.319
No, actually, strangely,
we have moved on from that.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.429
Really?

06:25.430 --> 06:27.279
Yeah, it's just bottled down
nice and deep

06:27.280 --> 06:28.459
where it will either be
absorbed into his body

06:28.460 --> 06:31.349
or it will lead to septic shock.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.409
I don't know, I'm crazy.
I've just been...

06:33.410 --> 06:35.299
I haven't been sleeping because I got

06:35.300 --> 06:36.459
these birds outside my window
and they're going,

06:36.460 --> 06:39.279
"Chirp, chirp, chirp,"
constantly, and you know,

06:39.280 --> 06:41.459
is it wrong that
I just want them to die?

06:41.460 --> 06:43.439
Where's the bathroom key?

06:43.440 --> 06:47.269
Um, Jennifer borrowed it this morning.

06:47.270 --> 06:48.349
Who's Jennifer?

06:48.350 --> 06:49.419
She's the new woman next door.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.369
And she didn't bring it back?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.239
That's rude.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.269
Do you want me to call her?

06:54.270 --> 06:55.369
No, I mean, I'm heading out.

06:55.370 --> 06:58.350
I'm just gonna go
down at the coffee place.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.309
Whew.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.300
What the fuck?

07:13.260 --> 07:15.269
Experimental goat cheese.

07:15.270 --> 07:17.349
Every batch is different. You want some?

07:17.350 --> 07:18.350
No, I'm good.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.439
You ever play?

07:24.440 --> 07:26.239
The piano?

07:26.240 --> 07:27.289
Mm-hmm.

07:27.290 --> 07:28.379
It's more for show really.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.399
Hmm. That's a shame.

07:34.450 --> 07:38.249
So, your mom tells me
you're not going back to school.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.259
It's too traumatic.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.409
I decided to take a hiatus,
maybe go backpacking.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.289
- Really?
- No.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.439
We're touring East Alvarado tomorrow.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.249
Public school.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.419
I didn't know it was that bad.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.269
What do you mean?

07:53.270 --> 07:55.269
Have you ever been to public school?

07:55.270 --> 07:57.409
There's metal detectors and drug dogs,

07:57.410 --> 08:00.239
shakedowns, raids.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.309
They don't have enough chairs.

08:01.310 --> 08:03.229
- Okay, Alex.
- I'm serious.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.449
The only advantage
of going to public school

08:04.450 --> 08:06.379
is one day, if you survive,

08:06.380 --> 08:09.249
you get to say,
"And I went to public school."

08:09.250 --> 08:11.309
Great, and then everyone will resent me.

08:11.310 --> 08:12.359
Only privately.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.369
Why is this happening to me?

08:15.370 --> 08:17.350
Why is this happening <i>for</i> you?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.269
It's positive thinking. It's like, if...

08:21.270 --> 08:23.379
No, I know what it means.
Why did you say it?

08:23.380 --> 08:26.299
I find it's a helpful way
to examine your life.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.429
Oh. Says who?

08:27.430 --> 08:29.380
Says Kai.

08:34.320 --> 08:37.260
<i>♪ ♪</i>

08:40.370 --> 08:43.279
I think I can see inside of that person.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.299
She's sweating out her insecurities.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.449
- 3 pounds of water weight?
- Mm-hmm.

08:47.450 --> 08:50.339
And it'll come right back.
That's the secret.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.290
It's how people get
addicted to hot yoga.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.369
Is it always so warm in here?

08:55.370 --> 08:57.329
Yup.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.369
Hey, what are your thoughts
on a magnet school?

08:59.370 --> 09:01.229
I have no idea what that is.

09:01.230 --> 09:02.389
Boarding school?

09:02.390 --> 09:04.269
Do you really want to be
one of those equestrian girls

09:04.270 --> 09:05.349
with a riding crop under her mattress?

09:05.350 --> 09:07.349
I'm not even gonna try to unpack that.

09:07.350 --> 09:09.229
Probably for the best.

09:09.230 --> 09:10.349
Could just get my GED.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.459
That's for inmates and child actors.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.400
You're worthless, you know that?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.409
We should do this more often,
just the two of us.

09:20.410 --> 09:21.459
Please slow down.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.429
- Hey, Alex.
- Oh, hey, Beth.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.459
You weren't in your usual spot.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.359
I thought you were slacking.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.309
Yeah, I was hanging
on the side with Laura here.

09:28.310 --> 09:30.249
Oh, my God, is this your daughter?

09:30.250 --> 09:32.399
Niece, but we're actually
the same person.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.329
Uh, no, I'm better adjusted.

09:35.330 --> 09:36.399
She is.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.419
Well, I was gonna take a walk,

09:39.420 --> 09:42.299
maybe get a bite to eat, see a movie.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.410
You want to meet me?

09:45.270 --> 09:48.319
Oh, man. You know...

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
What?

09:49.321 --> 09:52.319
I would. I would,

09:52.320 --> 09:54.349
but you're actually a real person,

09:54.350 --> 09:58.289
and the thought of intimacy or...

09:58.290 --> 10:03.339
really anything beyond a night
of meaningless sex is just...

10:03.340 --> 10:08.329
it's totally crushing
on an existential level, so...

10:08.330 --> 10:10.410
rain check?

10:12.430 --> 10:14.410
Okay.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.280
Fucking phase three!

10:40.390 --> 10:42.349
Hey.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.369
What happened to you?

10:45.370 --> 10:47.279
Yoga.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.270
Beauty cult.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.429
It's not even self loathing,
'cause that would be to obvious.

10:56.430 --> 11:00.259
It's like this unspecified malaise

11:00.260 --> 11:03.349
that just sucks you in like gravity.

11:03.350 --> 11:06.250
It's almost inescapable.
Am I making any sense.

11:07.350 --> 11:09.379
He forced me to run with him.

11:09.380 --> 11:10.429
Oh.

11:10.430 --> 11:13.419
And he... shamed me onto his diet.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.359
He threw away all my food.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.289
You look skinnier.

11:17.290 --> 11:19.330
Valerie, I'm hungry.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.279
Look, I just wish we could
bring him back to how he was.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.359
Really?

11:30.360 --> 11:32.419
Well, I mean, he's on the path
to spiritual enlightenment.

11:32.420 --> 11:35.289
But can't you get him laid or something?

11:35.290 --> 11:36.349
Already tried that, phase one.

11:36.350 --> 11:37.399
Yes.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.399
That is where Alex thrives, phase one.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.309
You can bring him back.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.429
You want your mentally unstable,

11:43.430 --> 11:45.359
possibly suicidal brother

11:45.360 --> 11:49.230

and philandering?

11:52.460 --> 11:55.229

12:01.450 --> 12:05.269

They're not good at all.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.359

12:40.360 --> 12:42.359
It sounds serious.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.289
Yeah, 'cause you know what?
She's trying to drive me out.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.309

That's what it is.

12:46.310 --> 12:48.459
Yeah, that's what it is.

Mind if I tag along?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.339
Why?

13:21.340 --> 13:24.320
Because I like doing things
and this is a thing.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.259
So do you offer electives?

13:39.260 --> 13:43.229

shop, it's all in the packet.

13:43.230 --> 13:44.309

13:44.310 --> 13:46.339
Painting, drawing, and drama.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.439
39 for 11th graders.

Couldn't get to 40, huh?

13:57.260 --> 13:58.419
Which child did they leave behind?

13:58.420 --> 14:01.379
Laura, what do you think
about the school?

14:01.380 --> 14:05.419
Uh, I think I'm gonna speak

14:05.420 --> 14:06.449
Well, if you need anything else,

14:06.450 --> 14:07.450
I will be in my office.

14:07.451 --> 14:09.309
Thank you.

14:09.310 --> 14:12.229
Still curious
about your chair situation.

14:12.230 --> 14:13.239
- Val.
- I know.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.389
- Come on.
- I know.

14:14.390 --> 14:16.269
This is depressing,
we can't send her here.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.339
Hell, I'd do a better job teaching her.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.329
I told Laura that I would support

14:19.330 --> 14:20.459
whatever decision she made.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.299
Well, then don't let her make this one.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.269
Well, we don't have a lot of options.

14:24.270 --> 14:25.329
No private school's gonna take her

14:25.330 --> 14:26.330
with such short notice.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.260
I don't know.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.329
Oh, shit!

14:32.330 --> 14:33.459

Thank you.

14:41.390 --> 14:44.229
Hey. Do you go to school here?

14:44.230 --> 14:46.439
No, I just like to hang out
in this hallway.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.289
Right, sorry.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.419
Well, could you tell me what it's like?

14:51.420 --> 14:53.229
'Cause I'm thinking of transferring

14:53.230 --> 14:54.349
from Cedar Ridge.

14:54.350 --> 14:55.369
Why?

14:55.370 --> 14:57.280
Sex scandal.

14:59.430 --> 15:02.319
So, what's it like here?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.279
It's all the same.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.389
School's a fucking drag everywhere.

15:06.390 --> 15:09.439
I guess the worst part here
is watching the teachers

15:09.440 --> 15:12.440
wonder every day how their lives
went so wrong.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.280
Okay.

15:26.340 --> 15:27.389
How's it going?

15:27.390 --> 15:28.439
Fine, I guess.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.389
You sure?

15:31.390 --> 15:33.359
I didn't like that school.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.299
Yeah. Neither did I.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.389
I'm starving.

15:38.390 --> 15:40.399
Me too. How 'bout we order in?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.289
- Only if it's junk.
- Done.

15:42.290 --> 15:43.290
Hello?

15:43.291 --> 15:44.399
Alex?

15:44.400 --> 15:47.249
Yeah, of course. I'll be right there.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.249
No, don't worry about it. I'm on my way.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.230
Leon needs me.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.239
Well, you scared me.
I mean, an actual phone call?

16:05.240 --> 16:06.399
There's protocol to this stuff.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.349
Unless you're bleeding out
on the sidewalk, just text.

16:09.350 --> 16:13.269
Sorry, I-I had a bit
of a rough go of it today.

16:13.270 --> 16:15.269
Yeah? What's up?

16:15.270 --> 16:18.359
I-I saw a picture of Mara.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.449
Your ex-fiancée?

16:19.450 --> 16:20.459
Yeah.

16:20.460 --> 16:22.389
I follow her on Instagram,

16:22.390 --> 16:26.379
which is a bad idea, but her
compositions are well conceived.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.339
That's bullshit.

16:28.340 --> 16:33.269
Anyway, there was a picture
of her and another man,

16:33.270 --> 16:37.349
and they were holding hands.

16:37.350 --> 16:39.269
Aw, fuck.

16:39.270 --> 16:42.459
I clicked on him and
there were more pictures,

16:42.460 --> 16:45.239
and when I scrolled down, I saw this.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.319
Oh, man! Fucking bitch.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.339
When she cheated, she moved out

16:51.340 --> 16:56.389
and we just stopped talking.
There was never... closure.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.329
That's hard, man.

16:58.330 --> 16:59.349
I feel like I was never allowed

16:59.350 --> 17:04.439
to move forward, to heal.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.378
She really hurt you, didn't she?

17:06.380 --> 17:10.409
I-I think we've both been hurt
by the ones we love.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.449
But...

17:16.450 --> 17:21.348
if we don't confront it,
we never get better.

17:21.349 --> 17:24.329
Shouldn't we talk about these things?

17:24.329 --> 17:28.460
Shouldn't we tell them how we feel?

17:33.230 --> 17:35.270
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.449
Yes. Yeah, great.

17:39.450 --> 17:42.229
Perhaps we should get some shots.

17:42.230 --> 17:43.309
No time for that. Let's go.

17:43.310 --> 17:44.310
Go... go... go where?

17:44.311 --> 17:45.389
To Mara's.

17:45.390 --> 17:46.449
- Mara's?
- Yeah, for closure.

17:46.450 --> 17:48.249
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.369
But I...

17:49.370 --> 17:50.370
Well, I don't know where she's moved

17:50.371 --> 17:52.249
and I erased her number.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.339
Let's just sit down and...

17:53.340 --> 17:55.409
Leon, I cyber-stalked Mara
the day I met you.

17:55.410 --> 17:56.410

you know, dealing with my parents

18:30.370 --> 18:33.299
and taking care of Alex and...

18:33.300 --> 18:36.460
kind of had to be a grown-up
before I was done being a kid.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.349
And then what?

18:42.350 --> 18:49.289
And then I met your dad, had you...

18:49.290 --> 18:51.339

kind of fell into place.

18:53.320 --> 18:57.299

Sometimes I wish he'd say something.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.269
He's healing in his own way.

19:26.270 --> 19:28.459
Does he hate me?

19:28.460 --> 19:31.399
No, I don't think
he really hates anybody.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.229
Alex! Stop.

19:43.230 --> 19:45.289
This is for your own good.
Mara needs to hear this.

19:45.290 --> 19:47.329
Look, look, I don't care about Mara.

19:47.330 --> 19:49.239

- No, I don't.

20:03.430 --> 20:05.449
What are you doing here?

20:05.450 --> 20:08.369

He trusted you, let you into his home,

20:28.270 --> 20:30.349

No. No, fuck that.
