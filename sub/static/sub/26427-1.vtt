01:07.585 --> 01:09.587
Help! I need help!

01:18.496 --> 01:19.796
Help! Help!

01:19.798 --> 01:21.964
How can we be
of service?

01:21.966 --> 01:23.699
The children need
a story, a new story.

01:23.701 --> 01:25.836
A new story!
How exciting!

01:25.838 --> 01:27.872
It is! I'm looking
for Horse Play,

01:27.874 --> 01:30.607
the world's only super-duper
story delivery service.

01:30.609 --> 01:31.875
Have you seen them?

01:31.877 --> 01:33.343
We are them!

01:33.345 --> 01:36.514
You are the fearless word
hunters that travel the universe

01:36.516 --> 01:38.715
in search of new
and exciting stories?

01:38.717 --> 01:39.816
We are!

01:39.818 --> 01:42.420
You fly from foreign
lands to alien planets

01:42.422 --> 01:44.155
across vast and
dangerous landscapes

01:44.157 --> 01:46.690
in search of unique plots
and exciting themes?

01:46.692 --> 01:48.692
That's us.

01:48.694 --> 01:51.796
We seek comedies,
dramas, mysteries, truths!

01:51.798 --> 01:55.033
Search for secrets, suspects,
and a few hefty clues.

01:55.035 --> 01:57.936
Mix sentences and
paragraphs in a word stew

01:57.938 --> 02:01.138
and cook up a brand-new
story for you.

02:01.140 --> 02:02.239
Welcome to Horse Play,

02:02.241 --> 02:05.677
the world's only super-duper
story delivery service.

02:05.679 --> 02:08.846
The sky is our office,
and I'm Axel the airplane.

02:08.848 --> 02:11.183
I'm Scout the horse.

02:11.185 --> 02:12.717
How can we help?

02:12.719 --> 02:14.887
The children
need a new story.

02:14.889 --> 02:16.522
Let's find one.

02:16.524 --> 02:17.825
Do the children
have any ideas?

02:22.129 --> 02:25.197
I was flying through the Enchanted
Forest, hunting for my dinner,

02:25.199 --> 02:26.833
when a boy called to me.

02:26.835 --> 02:28.467
I hear owls are very wise

02:28.469 --> 02:31.102
and can find anything
in the universe.

02:31.104 --> 02:32.103
Is that true?

02:32.105 --> 02:33.472
Is it true?

02:33.474 --> 02:35.507
Why, yes!
Then, the boy said...

02:35.509 --> 02:38.846
The children need a new story.
Can you find Horse Play?

02:38.848 --> 02:40.680
Horse Play?
Is that a game?

02:40.682 --> 02:43.650
You never
heard of Horse Play?

02:43.652 --> 02:46.853
Why, they are the only super-duper
story delivery service

02:46.855 --> 02:48.055
in the entire universe.

02:48.057 --> 02:49.222
That's us!

02:49.224 --> 02:51.525
I promised the boy
I would find you.

02:51.527 --> 02:53.960
As I was about to fly away,
the boy yelled after me.

02:53.962 --> 02:55.496
When you find Horse Play,

02:55.498 --> 02:59.132
tell them the children would like the
story to begin on the Isle of Flowers.

02:59.134 --> 03:02.903
The Isle of Flowers, a fine
choice to begin a story.

03:02.905 --> 03:06.608
Lush landscape filled
with field after field

03:06.610 --> 03:09.009
of beautiful,
colorful flowers.

03:09.011 --> 03:10.580
Quiet!

03:12.114 --> 03:14.014
I think I'm being followed.

03:14.016 --> 03:16.084
So, the story begins.

03:16.086 --> 03:18.887
Once upon a time,
there was an owl.

03:18.889 --> 03:21.055
- What's your name?
- Barney Owl.

03:21.057 --> 03:23.624
Once upon a time, there
was an owl named Barney.

03:23.626 --> 03:24.960
I'm in the story!

03:24.962 --> 03:26.928
Of course!
You begin the story

03:26.930 --> 03:30.099
when you talk to the boy
with brown hair and freckles.

03:30.101 --> 03:33.301
Barney Owl was flying
through the Enchanted Forest

03:33.303 --> 03:36.639
when a boy with brown hair
and freckles called out to him.

03:36.641 --> 03:38.073
I heard owls
are very wise

03:38.075 --> 03:40.276
and can find anything
in the universe.

03:40.278 --> 03:41.476
Is that true?

03:41.478 --> 03:44.813
When Barney told the boy that,
yes, owls are very clever,

03:44.815 --> 03:45.948
the boy said...

03:45.950 --> 03:49.219
The children need a new story.
Can you find Horse Play?

03:49.221 --> 03:51.620
"Is that a game?"
Barney asked the boy.

03:51.622 --> 03:54.256
No!

03:54.258 --> 03:57.861
Horse Play is the only super-duper
story delivery service

03:57.863 --> 03:59.261
in the entire universe.

03:59.263 --> 04:01.096
The children will
love that beginning.

04:01.098 --> 04:02.499
Please continue.

04:02.501 --> 04:05.969
The children wanted the new story
to begin on the Isle of Flowers,

04:05.971 --> 04:11.675
a magical land filled with field after
field of sweet-smelling blossoms.

04:11.677 --> 04:14.178
This is getting good.

04:14.180 --> 04:15.011
Please continue.

04:15.013 --> 04:18.749
The Isle of Flowers
is a tiny island

04:18.750 --> 04:22.253
floating in the middle
of a blue ocean.

04:22.255 --> 04:24.355
It's home to the most
beautiful honey bees.

04:24.357 --> 04:25.956
Excellent description.

04:25.958 --> 04:28.859
If I close my eyes,
I can see the Isle of Flowers.

04:28.861 --> 04:29.927
Please continue.

04:29.929 --> 04:31.227
That's all I have.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.097
That's it?
It can't be!

04:34.099 --> 04:37.034
A story has a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

04:37.036 --> 04:39.070
There's a good guy,
and a bad guy,

04:39.072 --> 04:41.973
adventure, intrigue,
and excitement.

04:41.975 --> 04:43.909
You're right.
To continue the story,

04:43.911 --> 04:47.012
Axel and I must fly at once
to the Isle of Flowers.

04:47.014 --> 04:49.313
Yeah, I'm sure we'll find
more of the story there.

04:49.315 --> 04:51.716
Everyone has a piece
of the plot, you know.

04:51.718 --> 04:53.019
Plot?

04:53.021 --> 04:56.120
The main events that happen in a
story, what the story is about.

04:56.122 --> 04:58.156
How do you find new stories?

04:58.158 --> 04:59.926
Are they hatched like an egg?

04:59.928 --> 05:01.861
Buried underground
like treasure?

05:01.863 --> 05:04.063
Do you take a pill,
drink a magic potion?

05:04.065 --> 05:07.400
It is a kind of magic!

05:07.402 --> 05:10.369
We gather plot pieces,
sew them together,

05:10.371 --> 05:14.039
and voila, a new story
for the children is born.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.174
Sounds exciting!

05:15.176 --> 05:17.876
It is!
Off we go!

05:17.878 --> 05:19.647
To the Isle of Flowers!

05:20.914 --> 05:23.116
A horse and an airplane,
what a sight!

05:23.118 --> 05:26.220
They fly in the day.
They fly through the night.

05:26.222 --> 05:28.389
Axel the airplane
steers the course

05:28.391 --> 05:31.190
for his partner and
passenger, Scout the horse.

05:31.192 --> 05:33.060
Horse Play is
their business name.

05:33.062 --> 05:37.033
Finding super-duper stories
is their claim to fame.

05:51.815 --> 05:53.847
I think Barney
the owl was right.

05:53.849 --> 05:55.015
We're being followed.

05:55.017 --> 05:56.685
Let's add that to the story.

05:56.687 --> 05:58.952
It will keep
the children interested.

05:58.954 --> 06:00.955
Yes, the boy will ask,

06:00.957 --> 06:03.058
"Who was following
Axel and Scout?"

06:03.060 --> 06:05.260
It will keep him wondering
what will happen next.

06:05.262 --> 06:07.395
Chatty, little Barney Owl.

06:07.397 --> 06:08.729
Too chatty.

06:08.731 --> 06:11.132
Victor the vulture?

06:11.134 --> 06:14.170
You only appear when
something smells bad.

06:14.172 --> 06:17.706
If it isn't Scout,

06:17.708 --> 06:20.109
the adventure-thirsty,
mustang nag,

06:20.111 --> 06:24.149
putting around the sky with his
do-gooder tin can sidekick, Axel.

06:25.049 --> 06:27.917
You two losers still
peddling your stupor-duper

06:27.919 --> 06:29.485
story delivery service?

06:29.487 --> 06:30.752
We are.

06:30.754 --> 06:34.189
You still destroying and gobbling
up troublesome storylines?

06:34.191 --> 06:36.760
Of course, I'm a vulture.

06:36.762 --> 06:37.863
Yes.

06:39.165 --> 06:43.800
Now, tell me. What did that old
owl, Barney, ask you to do?

06:43.802 --> 06:46.435
Never mind.

06:46.437 --> 06:49.238
I'll find out what you're
up to soon enough.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.976
Now, fly away before I stick
a feather in your engine.

06:52.978 --> 06:56.079
You fly away before I horse
kick you out of the sky.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.860
I see you're busy
pollinating them flowers.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.197
Howdy, boys. What
can I do for you?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.231
Honey.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.135
Mmm. My favorite subject!

07:50.137 --> 07:52.205
Anything special
about your honey?

07:52.207 --> 07:57.109
Only that it's the sweetest,
the tastiest, stickiest of all.

07:57.111 --> 08:00.513
I'd offer you some,
but I'm running kind of low.

08:00.515 --> 08:03.316
Low on honey? Oh, no!

08:03.318 --> 08:06.385
- Oh, yes! Didn't you hear?
- Hear what?

08:06.387 --> 08:08.921
Someone knocked over
the bee hives.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.190
The bee hives?

08:10.192 --> 08:12.225
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

08:12.227 --> 08:15.362
My bee friends and
family had to buzz away

08:15.364 --> 08:16.896
and find a new home.

08:16.898 --> 08:18.566
That's just plumb awful.

08:18.568 --> 08:20.501
Did a skunk knock over
the bee hives?

08:20.503 --> 08:22.468
How ever did you know?

08:22.470 --> 08:24.405
I smell a whiff of skunk,

08:24.407 --> 08:27.441
see a few black and white
hairs in that flower,

08:27.443 --> 08:29.076
spot a paw print
in the dirt...

08:29.078 --> 08:30.610
You are amazing, Scout!

08:30.612 --> 08:35.014
Yep, one of them furry, striped varmints
found its way right into our hive.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.452
I wonder if Victor the vulture
had something to do with this.

08:38.453 --> 08:41.356
You mean that vulture?

08:41.357 --> 08:44.192
He's been circling,
flapping his wings.

08:44.193 --> 08:46.595
Hmm. Don't he ever get tired?

08:46.597 --> 08:49.364
Them vultures can stay
in the air for hours.

08:49.366 --> 08:51.899
Why would a vulture
bother us bees?

08:51.901 --> 08:53.601
He's become part of the story.

08:53.603 --> 08:58.240
A new story! Ooh!
What do you have so far?

08:58.242 --> 09:02.344
Once upon a time, Barney Owl was
flying over the Enchanted Forest

09:02.346 --> 09:06.616
when a boy with brown hair and
freckles asked him to find Horse Play.

09:06.618 --> 09:07.684
That's you.

09:07.686 --> 09:10.285
The boy said, "The
children need a new story.

09:10.287 --> 09:12.088
Can you find Horse Play?"

09:12.090 --> 09:14.991
He also told Barney the children
wanted the story to begin

09:14.993 --> 09:17.425
at the Isle of Flowers.

09:17.427 --> 09:20.396
That's why you're here!
Please, continue.

09:20.398 --> 09:25.135
The Isle of Flowers is a tiny land
floating in the middle of the ocean.

09:25.137 --> 09:28.405
It's a land filled
with field after field

09:28.407 --> 09:31.440
of beautiful,
colorful flowers.

09:31.442 --> 09:34.076
Excellent description
of my tiny home.

09:34.078 --> 09:37.647
Bees love living
on the Isle of Flowers.

09:37.649 --> 09:40.483
They buzz around
day after day,

09:40.485 --> 09:41.919
pollinating beautiful fields,

09:41.921 --> 09:47.392
so everyone can enjoy red, yellow,
and blue sweet-smelling blossoms.

09:47.394 --> 09:52.363
Don't forget orange, green,
and my favorite color, pink.

09:52.365 --> 09:55.365
One fine day, the story
continues, a vulture...

09:55.367 --> 09:56.367
Victor!

09:56.369 --> 09:59.671
A pesky vulture named
Victor talked a skunk

09:59.673 --> 10:02.306
into knocking over all the
bee hives on the island.

10:02.308 --> 10:04.609
- Why'd he do that?
- We're not sure.

10:04.611 --> 10:07.577
We haven't discovered
that part of the story yet.

10:07.579 --> 10:08.979
It's a mystery!

10:08.981 --> 10:13.118
Broken beehives forced many of the
bees to fly away from the island,

10:13.120 --> 10:15.620
but one special bee remained,

10:15.622 --> 10:16.654
Bella Bee.

10:16.656 --> 10:17.755
That's me!

10:17.757 --> 10:22.061
Bella Bee buzzes around
the Isle of Flowers singing,

10:22.063 --> 10:25.129
her voice as sweet
and silky as her honey.

10:25.131 --> 10:27.666
Aw! Shucks!

10:27.668 --> 10:29.668
Bella Bee sings about flowers.

10:29.670 --> 10:33.304
♪ A sprinkle here

10:33.306 --> 10:35.607

10:49.491 --> 10:53.159
Bella Bee has such a
soft, lilting voice

10:53.161 --> 10:58.497
anyone who hears it
falls into a deep sleep.

10:58.499 --> 11:02.435
While they're asleep,
Bella Bee performs magic.

11:02.437 --> 11:03.603
Oh, my!

11:03.605 --> 11:05.740
Bella Bee has a secret.

11:05.742 --> 11:07.675
I do love secrets.

11:07.677 --> 11:10.410
Bella Bee spins honey into gold.

11:10.412 --> 11:11.511
That's fantastic!

11:11.513 --> 11:14.180
The children will love
a story about a singing bee

11:14.182 --> 11:16.183
who spins honey into gold.

11:16.185 --> 11:18.486
Yeah, but wait just a second!

11:18.488 --> 11:22.256
You go spreading a story about
me spinning honey into gold,

11:22.258 --> 11:24.725
and this entire island
will be overrun

11:24.727 --> 11:27.295
with greedy gold-diggers.

11:27.297 --> 11:29.097
You have a better idea?

11:29.099 --> 11:30.498
Hmm.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.501
I do!

11:32.568 --> 11:34.268
Why don't y'all go
to Lava Land?

11:34.270 --> 11:36.304
Lava Land,
an empty planet

11:36.306 --> 11:39.507
with fiery volcanoes
constantly erupting,

11:39.509 --> 11:42.044
spewing ash
and hot, molten rock.

11:42.046 --> 11:44.445
Fiery and hot,
but not empty.

11:44.447 --> 11:47.517
Nog the Hog, the mighty
dragon chaser, lives there.

11:47.519 --> 11:50.052
Oh, children love dragons.

11:50.054 --> 11:51.454
I suppose a visit
to Lava Land

11:51.456 --> 11:53.623
could move the story along
quite nicely.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.358
Bella Bee did not want the story

11:55.360 --> 11:58.293
to be about her spinning
honey into gold.

11:58.295 --> 12:02.364
She said there was a much better
story to find on Lava Land,

12:02.366 --> 12:04.433
home of the three, fat hogs,

12:04.435 --> 12:08.539
one of them known
as the "Dragon Chaser."

12:09.640 --> 12:14.445
The children will love, love,
love their new story.

Scout, Axel, I have
some exciting dialogue

12:39.406 --> 12:43.140
to add to your
super-duper story.

12:43.142 --> 12:44.576
Oink the flying pig!

12:44.578 --> 12:46.410
Children love pigs!

12:46.412 --> 12:48.379
Especially flying pigs!

12:48.381 --> 12:51.815
And superheroes!
See my red cape?

12:51.817 --> 12:54.785
After visiting Bella Bee
on the Isle of Flowers,

12:54.787 --> 12:57.822
Scout and Axel fly through
the sky towards Lava Land.

12:57.824 --> 13:00.159
Suddenly, they see Oink,

13:00.161 --> 13:02.460
the flying pig,

13:02.462 --> 13:05.164
a superhero wearing
a bright red cape.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.366
I'm so glad I found you.

13:07.368 --> 13:10.569
You know, "dialogue" is
when characters in a story

13:10.571 --> 13:13.338
talk or have
a conversation.

13:13.340 --> 13:16.308
Children love a good story
with good dialogue.

13:16.310 --> 13:20.346
Well, I have some very
important information

13:20.348 --> 13:23.382
to share about
Victor the vulture.

13:23.384 --> 13:26.353
Oh, goody! We do need
to learn more about Victor.

13:26.355 --> 13:32.325
I know why Victor the vulture
destroyed the beehives.

13:32.327 --> 13:33.792
He's following you.

13:33.794 --> 13:37.931
Character development
is so important for a story.

13:37.933 --> 13:41.801
Victor the vulture
does not want you

13:41.803 --> 13:44.738
to find the children
a new story.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.373
He flies around the universe

13:46.375 --> 13:50.344
searching for sad,
unfinished stories to eat.

13:50.346 --> 13:52.812
He hates happy endings.

13:52.814 --> 13:56.249
He will do anything
to stop them from happening.

13:56.251 --> 13:59.519
That is a very important part
of this story.

13:59.521 --> 14:01.922
Oink the flying pig,
a superhero,

14:01.924 --> 14:03.691
known for
solving mysteries,

14:03.693 --> 14:05.927
and saving animals
throughout the universe,

14:05.929 --> 14:10.263
joins Axel and Scout
as they fly towards Lava Land.

14:10.265 --> 14:14.669
Oh, goody!
I made it into the new story!

14:14.671 --> 14:16.737
I'm so excited!

14:16.739 --> 14:22.343
Oh, but did you say you were
flying towards Lava land?

14:22.345 --> 14:23.678
Why, yes!

14:23.680 --> 14:26.782
That's a very dangerous planet!

14:26.784 --> 14:28.784
Your cousins
live there, don't they?

14:28.786 --> 14:33.590
Do you know the story
of the three, fat hogs?

14:35.259 --> 14:37.860
Is that the same
as the three little pigs?

14:37.862 --> 14:41.764
Does that story have
a fire-breathing dragon?

14:41.766 --> 14:42.765
I don't think so.

14:42.767 --> 14:46.635
Well, then talk to the
hogs on Lava Land.

14:46.637 --> 14:49.405
I'll keep an eye
on Victor for you.

14:49.407 --> 14:51.442
Be safe and beware!

14:54.412 --> 14:58.648
Oink tells Axel and Scout that
Victor is following them around,

14:58.650 --> 15:02.018
because he eats bad,
unfinished stories

15:02.020 --> 15:04.354
and hates happy endings.

15:04.356 --> 15:07.891
"Be safe and beware," Oink shouts
before flying off into the clouds.

15:07.893 --> 15:11.694
Scout, we can't let Victor stop
us from finishing the story.

15:11.696 --> 15:13.363
Don't worry, Axel.

Lava Land
is a hot, fiery planet.

15:32.885 --> 15:36.354
Volcanoes constantly spew
smoky, burning, molten rock

15:36.356 --> 15:39.623
which covers just about everything
on the planet, except...

15:39.625 --> 15:42.926
Look, Scout,
it's the three fat hogs.

15:42.928 --> 15:46.730
We heard one of you
is a dragon chaser.

15:46.732 --> 15:48.801
Correctamundo!

15:48.803 --> 15:50.939
Children love dragons.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.039
Everyone loves dragons.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.573
Where is your dragon?

15:55.575 --> 15:56.642
Can I tell the story?

15:56.644 --> 16:00.879
No, let me tell it.
I wanna tell it.

16:00.881 --> 16:03.648
I'll tell the story.

16:04.785 --> 16:07.519
It all started
when me and my brothers,

16:07.521 --> 16:10.656
Fog the hog and Log the hog,

16:10.658 --> 16:12.793
heard about a contest
on Lava Land.

16:12.795 --> 16:15.028
What sort of contest?

16:15.030 --> 16:19.598
A contest to build the strongest
house in the universe,

16:19.600 --> 16:21.967
a house that could
withstand fire...

16:21.969 --> 16:24.104
- Lava.
- Lightning.

16:24.106 --> 16:27.407
- Meteor strikes!
- Rain!

16:27.409 --> 16:31.812
Any house can stand a bit of rain, Fog.

16:31.814 --> 16:36.616
Since my brothers and I have built
houses all over the universe...

16:36.618 --> 16:38.051
We are very good builders.

16:38.053 --> 16:42.457
Some of my houses have been featured
in "Universal Homes Illustrated."

16:42.459 --> 16:46.093
I built the Mall
at the Top of the World.

16:46.095 --> 16:48.529
Very impressive.

16:48.531 --> 16:50.430
To get back to the story,

16:50.432 --> 16:53.067
thousands of contestants
arrived on Lava Land

16:53.069 --> 16:54.769
to compete in the contest.

16:54.771 --> 16:57.405
- Including us.
- Obviously!

16:57.407 --> 17:00.409
We had two months
to build a house.

17:00.411 --> 17:02.946
Then the real contest began.

17:04.446 --> 17:09.451
Two weeks later, only three
houses remained standing,

17:09.453 --> 17:10.886
ours.

17:10.887 --> 17:15.790
What happened
to the other 2,997 houses?

17:15.792 --> 17:18.527
Once a day,
we never knew when,

17:18.529 --> 17:21.996
a fiery dragon
reared its head

17:21.998 --> 17:24.434
out of the volcano
right behind me.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.970
A fiery dragon?
Oh, no!

17:26.972 --> 17:30.572
Oh, yes! A fiery dragon
leapt out of the volcano,

17:30.574 --> 17:32.609
aimed his fiery breath
at a house, and...

17:32.611 --> 17:36.780
Whoosh!
The building was set on fire.

17:36.782 --> 17:41.050
Some houses melted.
Others burned to the ground.

17:41.052 --> 17:42.551
Burned to the ground!

17:42.553 --> 17:44.620
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

17:44.622 --> 17:48.859
Only our three houses were
left standing, my house.

17:48.861 --> 17:51.027
- My house.
- And my house.

17:51.029 --> 17:54.197
The story
of the three, fat hogs.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.000
I see only one house.

17:56.002 --> 17:57.834
What happened
to the other two houses?

18:00.573 --> 18:05.141
I built my house out of the
strongest wooden logs.

18:05.143 --> 18:07.878
It was very beautiful,

18:07.880 --> 18:10.747
the best looking house of all.

18:10.749 --> 18:14.218
- It was very beautiful.
- It was very beautiful.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.719
Day after day,

18:15.721 --> 18:18.657
the dragon flew
above my house,

18:18.659 --> 18:21.959
blowing fire,
singing...

18:50.592 --> 18:53.092

18:53.094 --> 18:54.627
Oh, no!

18:54.629 --> 18:55.961
Oh, yes!

18:55.963 --> 18:59.632
His fiery breath swept
across the logs of my house

18:59.634 --> 19:01.535
until they caught fire.

19:01.537 --> 19:05.605
I told you not to build
your house out of logs.

19:05.607 --> 19:07.874
Wooden logs burn.

19:07.876 --> 19:12.278
Yeah, yeah!

19:12.280 --> 19:15.215
Know-it-all!

19:15.217 --> 19:17.985
Then, the dragon flew toward me,

19:17.987 --> 19:20.053
and I ran into Nog's house

19:20.055 --> 19:23.091
just as the flames
were about to devour me.

19:23.093 --> 19:24.128
How exciting!

19:25.162 --> 19:28.095
The next day, that dragon
came for my house!

19:28.097 --> 19:31.132
I ran outside, thinking he
could not burn my house down.

19:31.134 --> 19:35.870
As he flew toward Nog's house,
the dragon sang...

20:04.601 --> 20:06.801

20:09.005 --> 20:11.308
Concrete and iron rods
are strong.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.577
They shouldn't catch on fire.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.946
True! But Fog the Hog is lazy.

20:16.948 --> 20:20.215
He mixed batches of cheap
concrete and worked quickly,

20:20.217 --> 20:23.656
making fun of me for building
my house brick by brick.

20:24.755 --> 20:27.089
His house lasted two days

20:27.091 --> 20:29.826
before the dragon fire
destroyed it.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.994
Don't rub it in, Nog!

20:31.996 --> 20:33.696
The dragon chased me!

20:33.698 --> 20:35.866
But just before his fire
reached my hog tail,

20:35.868 --> 20:39.636
I ran into Nog's house
where I was safe.

20:39.638 --> 20:42.839
The next day, the dragon
roared through the sky,

20:42.841 --> 20:46.911
then flew right over my house.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.812
We peered through the window,

20:48.814 --> 20:51.150
watched him come,
breathing fire.

20:52.217 --> 20:55.886
As he flew toward Nog's house,
the dragon sang...

20:55.888 --> 20:58.924

21:29.090 --> 21:32.190
He opened his mouth,
and out flew flames.

21:32.192 --> 21:35.093
But instead of the house
catching on fire,

21:35.095 --> 21:37.062
the dragon sneezed.

21:37.064 --> 21:38.263
Again and again,

21:38.265 --> 21:43.703
the dragon opened his mouth
to spit fire on Nog's house,

21:43.705 --> 21:48.841
but all he did was sneeze,
and sneeze, and sneeze.

21:48.843 --> 21:51.445
That silly dragon
flew away in tears.

21:51.447 --> 21:54.316
A story with a moral!

21:55.817 --> 21:59.319
A housing-building contest
on the remote planet Lava Land

21:59.321 --> 22:02.222
attracted 3,000 entries.

22:02.224 --> 22:06.092
Every day, a dragon leapt
out of a fiery volcano,

22:06.094 --> 22:08.928
breathing fire on each
of the houses built.

22:08.930 --> 22:12.867
After several days,
only three houses remained.

22:12.869 --> 22:17.772
Each one belonging
to one of the three, fat hogs.

22:17.774 --> 22:19.274
What's a moral?

22:19.276 --> 22:22.444
The moral of a story
is meant to teach a lesson.

22:22.446 --> 22:26.715
It often has a message
of right and wrong, good or bad.

22:26.717 --> 22:29.050
Nog the hog won the contest.

22:29.052 --> 22:32.419
He built the strongest house
in the universe.

22:32.421 --> 22:35.858
He won because he was smart
and wasn't lazy.

22:35.860 --> 22:38.427
No matter how hard
the dragon tried,

22:38.429 --> 22:41.063
he could not burn down
Nog's house of bricks.

22:41.065 --> 22:44.166
The three fat hogs
were safe.

22:44.168 --> 22:46.368
And the moral of the story is...

22:46.370 --> 22:49.305
Wait!

22:49.307 --> 22:53.409
I may have cheated a bit.

22:53.411 --> 22:56.010
- Cheated? Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

22:56.012 --> 22:57.313
I discovered a secret.

22:57.315 --> 22:58.981
A secret?

23:00.251 --> 23:05.421
Most fire-breathing dragons are
allergic to hot chili peppers.

23:05.423 --> 23:10.427
So, I planted some in garden
pots on the roof of my house.

23:10.429 --> 23:14.898
Every time
the dragon flew by Nog's house,

23:14.900 --> 23:18.535
the smell of chili peppers
clogged his fire-sinuses.

23:18.537 --> 23:21.004
That dragon
sneezed and sneezed

23:21.006 --> 23:24.277
until he was so stuffed up

23:25.308 --> 23:28.278
he couldn't breathe fire.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.015
Nog is one smart hog.

23:31.017 --> 23:35.318
And that's the story
of the three fat hogs.

23:35.320 --> 23:38.355
A dragon
with a stuffed nose!

23:38.357 --> 23:41.925
That'll make the children laugh!

23:41.927 --> 23:44.497
It is a funny story,
and it has a plot twist.

23:45.831 --> 23:47.499
Uh...

23:47.501 --> 23:49.300
What's a plot twist?

23:49.302 --> 23:50.802
Where's the dragon now?

23:50.804 --> 23:53.872
He couldn't stop sneezing.

23:53.874 --> 23:57.542
He was so stuffed up,
he left Lava Land for good.

23:57.544 --> 24:00.913
Never did figure out
it was my chili peppers.

24:00.915 --> 24:03.548
Nog the hog was
a very clever swine.

24:03.550 --> 24:06.117
He not only won
the house-building contest.

24:06.119 --> 24:08.586
He tricked the dragon
into leaving Lava Land

24:08.588 --> 24:11.124
by planting hot chili peppers,

24:11.126 --> 24:13.559
a plant most dragons
are allergic to,

24:13.561 --> 24:15.595
right on the roof of his house.

24:15.597 --> 24:18.998
Nog the hog chased
the sneezing dragon away.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.934
It's fun
when a story makes you laugh.

24:21.936 --> 24:24.002
The children love to laugh.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.472
Do you need some more
funny bits for your story?

24:26.474 --> 24:28.841
Do you know
where we can find some?

24:28.843 --> 24:30.542
Go see Dumpty Donkey.

24:30.544 --> 24:33.613
He's always telling a story
that makes you laugh.

24:34.950 --> 24:38.418

24:38.420 --> 24:41.521

24:55.137 --> 24:57.370
Look, Scout,
it's a hot air balloon.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.441
With a bunny rabbit flying it!

24:59.443 --> 25:02.910
Ahoy there!
I'm Sounder Rabbit.

25:02.912 --> 25:05.880
Either of you two fellas
heard of Horse Play?

25:05.882 --> 25:08.382
We are Horse Play.
I'm Axel the airplane.

25:08.384 --> 25:10.651
I'm Scout the horse.

25:10.653 --> 25:14.589
You two are the super-duper
story delivery service?

25:14.591 --> 25:15.689
That's us.

25:15.691 --> 25:18.359
I've been
looking all over for you.

25:18.361 --> 25:20.995
The children want the story
to have a mystery.

25:20.997 --> 25:23.366
We was just in Lava Land.

25:23.368 --> 25:25.001
Lava Land, huh?

25:25.003 --> 25:27.637
While you were busy traveling
all over the universe,

25:27.639 --> 25:29.371
I fell victim to a robbery.

25:29.373 --> 25:31.306
A robbery?
Oh, no!

25:31.308 --> 25:33.141
Oh, yes!

25:33.143 --> 25:36.611
Someone has been stealing
Farmer McAdoo's vegetables.

25:36.613 --> 25:39.314
Stealing vegetables? Oh, no!

25:39.316 --> 25:40.448
Oh, yes!

25:40.450 --> 25:42.952
Farmer McAdoo works hard
in his garden.

25:42.954 --> 25:46.555
He plants seeds, and waters,
and feeds, and pulls weeds.

25:46.557 --> 25:48.225
As he works, he chants,

25:48.227 --> 25:51.361
"I plant it. I grow it.
I pick it. I eat it."

25:51.363 --> 25:54.063
Growing them vegetables
is hard work.

25:54.065 --> 25:56.600
It is. Farmer McAdoo
is very angry,

25:56.602 --> 26:00.070
because someone stole
all his vegetables.

26:00.072 --> 26:02.505
He wants to catch the thief.

26:02.507 --> 26:05.441
What's that in your hot
air balloon basket?

26:05.443 --> 26:07.209
Looks like carrot tops.

26:07.211 --> 26:10.046
Oh, this? It's just
a little snack.

26:10.048 --> 26:12.550
Will you take us
to Farmer McAdoo's garden?

26:12.552 --> 26:15.018
Me? Sorry. I'm in a hurry.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.554
But it's easy to get there.

26:16.556 --> 26:20.057
Take a right, then a left.
Uh, then a right, then a left.

26:20.059 --> 26:22.459
Go straight. Turn around.

26:22.461 --> 26:24.629
Land, and it's right there.

26:24.631 --> 26:25.964
Thanks, Sounder.

26:25.966 --> 26:28.265
We'll find out who stole Farmer
McAdoo's vegetables for you.

26:28.267 --> 26:32.135
♪ You grow it, you pick it
You pick it, you eat it ♪

26:32.137 --> 26:35.606
♪ You don't steal it ♪

26:35.608 --> 26:38.477
As soon as Axel
and Scout leave Lava Land,

26:38.479 --> 26:40.078
they meet up with Sounder,

26:40.080 --> 26:43.282
a rabbit flying a bright
red-and-yellow hot air balloon.

26:43.284 --> 26:47.119
"The children want the story to have
a mystery," Sounder tells them,

26:47.121 --> 26:49.087
then give them
one to solve.

26:49.089 --> 26:52.324
Someone stole
Farmer McAdoo's vegetables!

26:52.326 --> 26:56.094
Hey, don't forget to add,
"You grow it. You pick it.

26:56.096 --> 26:58.029
"You pick it. You eat it.

26:58.031 --> 26:59.968
You don't steal it."

27:01.269 --> 27:03.769
Such an
interesting story so far!

27:03.771 --> 27:07.239
But be careful.
Don't let it get out of hand.

27:09.443 --> 27:13.412
I just want you boys to know
I'm here waiting, just waiting

27:13.414 --> 27:16.415
for you to drop a story line,
confuse the plot,

27:16.417 --> 27:19.419
introduce one character
too many,

27:19.421 --> 27:22.221
and I'll greedily gulp,
guzzle, gorge,

27:22.223 --> 27:25.094
and gobble
all your mistakes.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.765
We've been following Victor.

27:30.767 --> 27:34.801
Victor convinced Stunt the
airplane to help ruin your story.

27:34.803 --> 27:35.970
My cousin Stunt?

27:35.972 --> 27:39.542
The most talented acrobatic
airplane in the universe.

27:40.542 --> 27:43.510
I've seen Stunt perform
amazing aerial tricks.

27:43.512 --> 27:45.512
He can spin, swoop...

27:45.514 --> 27:47.682
Why would Stunt team up
with Victor?

27:47.684 --> 27:50.152
Now, we have
two mysteries to solve.

27:50.154 --> 27:54.056
Mystery one, who was stealing
vegetables from Farmer McAdoo?

27:54.058 --> 27:56.290
Mystery two,
why is your cousin Stunt,

27:56.292 --> 27:59.260
the most acrobatic airplane
in the universe,

27:59.262 --> 28:02.263
working with Victor
to destroy our new story?

28:02.265 --> 28:05.133
Which mystery should
we solve first?

28:05.135 --> 28:06.134
Let's go to the farm field.

28:06.136 --> 28:09.237
Sounder Rabbit rides away
in a gust of wind.

28:09.239 --> 28:12.075
Seconds later,
Oink flies by.

28:12.077 --> 28:14.844
They've been following Victor
and discovered he's working

28:14.846 --> 28:19.449
with Stunt, Axel's cousin, an acrobatic
airplane, to ruin the new story.

28:19.451 --> 28:22.784
Now, Horse Play has
two big mysteries to solve.

28:22.786 --> 28:25.655
Stories are like
bright, white, fluffy clouds

28:25.657 --> 28:27.656
floating through the universe.

28:27.658 --> 28:31.094
Gigantic, white spaces
waiting to be filled in.

28:31.096 --> 28:33.695
By endless pools
of imagination.

28:35.467 --> 28:38.769
I love finding new stories.

28:38.771 --> 28:41.338
So, let's get on with this one.

28:41.340 --> 28:44.741
Axel and Scout bid Oink goodbye
and head for the farm field.

28:44.743 --> 28:46.546
We'll keep an eye on Victor.

28:49.849 --> 28:52.883
♪ Soar high
Soar low ♪

28:52.885 --> 28:55.852
♪ Up, up, and away ♪

28:55.854 --> 29:00.724
♪ Two important mysteries
must be solved today ♪

29:00.726 --> 29:02.459
When solving a mystery,

29:02.461 --> 29:06.630
it's best to find out
why a crime was committed.

29:06.632 --> 29:08.032
Aw, that's easy.

29:08.034 --> 29:11.769
Farmer McAdoo's vegetables were
stolen because someone was hungry.

29:11.771 --> 29:13.504
Did you notice the carrot tops

29:13.506 --> 29:15.807
sticking out of Sounder's
hot air balloon?

29:15.809 --> 29:18.142
Don't bunnies
always eat carrots?

29:18.144 --> 29:20.177
He was in an awful hurry.

29:20.179 --> 29:21.513
Is he a suspect?

29:21.515 --> 29:24.816
He is! I'm not sure if Sounder
Rabbit was telling the truth.

29:24.818 --> 29:30.188
You mean that cute,
little bunny rabbit lied?

29:30.190 --> 29:36.562
Sounder Rabbit was
acting very suspicious.

29:36.564 --> 29:40.533
Separating lies from truth is
how you solve a mystery, Axel.

29:40.535 --> 29:43.235
We need to gather more clues,
talk to more suspects.

29:43.237 --> 29:44.870
That's how we'll find out
who done it.

29:44.872 --> 29:48.475
Look! Down there!
It's Dumpty Donkey.

29:48.477 --> 29:50.442
Do donkeys eat vegetables?

29:50.444 --> 29:51.578
They sure do.

29:51.580 --> 29:52.849
Let's see what he knows.

29:59.888 --> 30:04.524
Hey! Was hoping
someone would stop by today.

30:04.526 --> 30:07.861
I got one doozy of a story.

30:07.863 --> 30:10.730
Yeah, we're here
to solve a mystery.

30:10.732 --> 30:12.533
My story is more exciting.

30:12.535 --> 30:18.339
I got adventure, drama,
even a big, old gator!

30:18.341 --> 30:21.741
Oh, but I'm being rude.

30:21.743 --> 30:24.745
What's this mystery
you gotta solve?

30:24.747 --> 30:27.547
A while ago, we were
flying through the sky

30:27.549 --> 30:29.550
when Sounder,
a bunny rabbit, flew by

30:29.552 --> 30:31.651
in a bright red-and-yellow
hot air balloon.

30:31.653 --> 30:35.623
He told us the children want
the new story to have a mystery.

30:35.625 --> 30:39.861
Then he said Farmer McAdoo's
garden vegetables were missing!

30:39.863 --> 30:43.598
Scout spotted some leafy, green
carrot tops in the balloon,

30:43.600 --> 30:45.633
and Sounder was in a hurry.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.469
So, he's a suspect.

30:47.471 --> 30:51.739
Hee-haw!

30:51.741 --> 30:53.775
Not much of a mystery!

30:53.777 --> 30:56.812
You already solved it.

30:56.814 --> 31:00.450
Sounder Rabbit stole
Farmer McAdoo's vegetables.

31:00.452 --> 31:02.884
- What?
- Sounder Rabbit tricked us.

31:02.886 --> 31:05.421
He stole
Farmer McAdoo's vegetables,

31:05.423 --> 31:07.923
sent us to the farm
to find the thief,

31:07.925 --> 31:09.992
then made a fast getaway
in his hot air balloon

31:09.994 --> 31:12.961
filled with the stolen carrots,
corn, and cucumbers.

31:12.963 --> 31:15.698
Sounder Rabbit tricked us?

31:15.700 --> 31:17.866
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

31:17.868 --> 31:21.938
The famous Horse Play
duo deceived, duped.

31:21.940 --> 31:25.375
Hee-haw!

31:37.556 --> 31:39.990
Stunt, what are you doing here?

31:39.992 --> 31:42.058
Is it true you're working
with Victor the vulture?

31:42.060 --> 31:43.894
I wanna be
in the story, cuz.

31:43.896 --> 31:45.162
The children will
love an airplane

31:45.164 --> 31:49.033
that flies in loops, nosedives,
and forms flips high in the sky.

31:49.035 --> 31:53.370
But the children didn't ask
for a story about stunt planes.

31:53.372 --> 31:55.740
I'm not here
to be a main character.

31:55.742 --> 31:57.075
Just a minor one.

31:57.077 --> 32:00.478
I'm Victor's assistant,
his partner in crime.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.378
That's right, Axel.

32:01.380 --> 32:04.749
Your cousin, Stunt,
is working for me.

32:04.751 --> 32:07.351
The children love bad guys,

32:07.353 --> 32:10.990
and I'm here to demand you
give me some of this story.

32:10.992 --> 32:14.025
Yeah, give Victor a few
scenes, and we'll fly away...

32:14.027 --> 32:15.694
for a while.

32:15.696 --> 32:18.597
Give you the story?
What for?

32:18.599 --> 32:21.834
I wanna eat it, of course!

32:21.836 --> 32:26.038
That's what vultures do to silly
storylines and bad dialogue.

32:26.040 --> 32:30.710
We devour it bit by bit
until it's no more.

32:30.712 --> 32:34.981
This story isn't that silly,
and I kind of like the dialogue.

32:34.983 --> 32:36.483
It's okay, Axel.

32:36.485 --> 32:38.819
I hate to admit it,

32:38.821 --> 32:41.655
but the story does need
a major edit.

32:41.657 --> 32:44.057
A mystery
with only one suspect,

32:44.059 --> 32:49.862
and the one suspect a cute, little
bunny rabbit who is guilty.

32:49.864 --> 32:52.866
That's not a very good story
for the children.

32:52.868 --> 32:56.802
So... we have to give Victor
part of the story?

32:56.804 --> 32:59.706
Poor, metal-headed horse-face.

32:59.708 --> 33:02.409
Don't be so hard on yourselves.

33:02.411 --> 33:03.945
It's the rules.

33:03.947 --> 33:06.113
It's part of a story.
You gotta edit,

33:06.115 --> 33:10.953
cut it out, toss it, and find
something better to replace it.

33:19.461 --> 33:22.730
Hey! Was hoping someone
would stop by today.

33:22.732 --> 33:25.967
I got one doozy of a story.

33:25.969 --> 33:27.770
What kind of story?

33:27.772 --> 33:29.004
It's very exciting!

33:29.006 --> 33:31.840
It's got adventure, drama,

33:31.842 --> 33:35.977
even a big, old gator!

33:35.979 --> 33:37.745
Picture this.

33:37.747 --> 33:43.685
It begins with a
long, wide river.

33:43.687 --> 33:47.055
The long, wide river flows

33:47.057 --> 33:51.494
for miles, and miles, and miles.

33:52.697 --> 33:56.599
On one side of the river,
there is not very much to eat.

33:56.601 --> 34:01.638
On the other side of the river,
there lies a field

34:01.640 --> 34:05.675
of tall, green grass,
fruit trees,

34:05.677 --> 34:09.878
and soft earth to dig
holes for burrows.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.216
Grumpy is a mean, old gator.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.821
Anyone who tries to cross
his river gets trapped

34:16.822 --> 34:20.591
between his mouth
full of very sharp teeth

34:20.592 --> 34:24.594
and is never seen
or heard from again.

34:24.596 --> 34:28.764
Oh, my!
This is a scary story.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.868
The children like
scary stories...

34:30.870 --> 34:33.770
as long as it's not too scary.

34:33.772 --> 34:34.873
Let me tell it.

34:34.875 --> 34:37.708
Um, unless you wanna tell it.

34:37.710 --> 34:39.446
Please, continue.

34:40.179 --> 34:44.081
So, living on one side
of the river is three

34:44.083 --> 34:46.885
of the most unusual friends

34:46.887 --> 34:50.088
a story ever did see.

34:50.090 --> 34:54.860
One is a goofy-looking rat
with bobbly, green eyes,

34:54.862 --> 34:56.795
two big, old front teeth,

34:56.797 --> 34:59.232
a long set of whiskers,

34:59.234 --> 35:01.933
and a growling stomach.

35:01.935 --> 35:04.604
This
here is Clack the rat,

35:04.606 --> 35:05.872
a nickname he got,

35:05.874 --> 35:11.576
'cause he makes this real loud
clacking sound with his teeth

35:11.578 --> 35:14.247
when he gets nervous.

35:14.249 --> 35:18.551
This second friend in this
unlikely trio is Hopper,

35:18.553 --> 35:20.218
a wide-eyed frog

35:20.220 --> 35:23.789
with long, thin arms

35:23.791 --> 35:26.462
and a mile-wide smile.

35:27.862 --> 35:30.931
The third friend is
a rather smart horse,

35:30.933 --> 35:35.536
who, come to think of it,
looks a lot like you, Scout.

35:35.538 --> 35:38.074
Only his name is Harry.

35:39.775 --> 35:42.543
Food was getting scarce
on their side of the river,

35:42.545 --> 35:46.981
and day after day,
these three unlikely friends

35:46.983 --> 35:49.816
dreamed about crossing
to the other side

35:49.818 --> 35:52.653
where delicious fruit
and berries grew

35:52.655 --> 35:56.256
on green, grassy slopes,

35:56.258 --> 35:57.991
but they knew if they tried,

35:57.993 --> 36:03.231
Grump Alligator would jump
out of the water and eat them.

36:03.233 --> 36:05.667
Eat them? Oh, no!

36:05.669 --> 36:07.571
Oh, yes!

36:08.604 --> 36:13.174
So, the three friends huddled
behind a big, old tree

36:13.176 --> 36:16.679
with long, hanging branches

36:16.681 --> 36:18.850
so Grumpy couldn't see them.

36:19.784 --> 36:24.920
One summer evening,
there was a huge storm.

36:24.922 --> 36:27.355
Thunder, and lightning,

36:27.357 --> 36:29.991
strong winds, and heavy rain.

36:29.993 --> 36:35.798
A bolt of lightning struck near the
weeping willow and lit the three friends.

36:35.800 --> 36:40.169
Exposed, they cringed in fear,

36:40.171 --> 36:44.039
thinking Grumpy would climb
onto the riverbank and eat them.

36:44.041 --> 36:48.313
But instead, it was Grumpy
that cringed in fear.

36:50.115 --> 36:53.316
Lightning!

36:53.318 --> 36:56.952
The dark sky!
Oh, it can't be!

36:56.954 --> 37:00.924
A very scary storm
coming after me!

37:00.926 --> 37:03.994
The next evening,
as the sky grew dark,

37:03.996 --> 37:08.031
another storm rumbled
on the horizon,

37:08.033 --> 37:11.234
and the friends hatched a plan.

37:11.236 --> 37:16.139
Grumpy Gator, Grumpy
Gator, I know you're there.

37:16.141 --> 37:19.909
If you let me cross the river,
I'll save you from a scare.

37:23.150 --> 37:24.816
How can you,

37:24.818 --> 37:26.385
a wee, little rat,

37:26.387 --> 37:31.889
save me,
a big, fat alligator?

37:31.891 --> 37:35.160
There's going to be
a lot more lightning tonight.

37:35.162 --> 37:38.063
If you let me pass to the
other side of the river,

37:38.065 --> 37:41.166
I will use my very loud
clacking teeth

37:41.168 --> 37:44.202
to scare away the storm.

37:44.204 --> 37:49.676
That is a very loud,
annoying sound.

37:49.678 --> 37:52.245
Does it really
scare away lightning?

37:52.247 --> 37:53.980
It does.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.348
If you let me pass to the
other side of the river,

37:56.350 --> 37:58.718
I will save you.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.953
Then, Clack, you rat,

38:00.955 --> 38:02.754
I will let you pass.

38:02.756 --> 38:05.857
But when the skies clear,

38:05.859 --> 38:09.728
I will eat you really fast.

38:09.730 --> 38:11.231
As the storm grew closer,

38:11.233 --> 38:14.300
Hopper Frog leapt
to the riverbank.

38:14.302 --> 38:17.438
Grumpy Gator, Grump
Gator, come up for air.

38:17.440 --> 38:20.840
Let me hop across the river,
and I'll save you from a scare.

38:20.842 --> 38:23.776
Grumpy Gator surfaces
from the water

38:23.778 --> 38:28.284
where he was trying to hide
from the incoming storm.

38:29.851 --> 38:33.487
How can you, a skinny,
silly frog, save me,

38:33.489 --> 38:37.024
a big, fat alligator,

38:37.026 --> 38:39.127
from a lightning storm?

38:39.129 --> 38:44.031
Hopper From sprang off the rock,
leapt above Grumpy's head.

38:44.033 --> 38:47.401
I'm a very special frog
who can jump really high.

38:47.403 --> 38:50.971
I'll snatch those lightning rods
right out of the sky.

38:50.973 --> 38:56.143
Help me, skinny frog, and I
will let you pass.

38:56.145 --> 39:01.784
But tomorrow, I'll sneak out of
the river and eat you in a flash.

39:01.786 --> 39:04.253
Hopper Frog croaks,

39:04.255 --> 39:06.155
hops from rock to rock,

39:06.157 --> 39:09.728
crosses the river,
and reaches the other side.

39:11.195 --> 39:14.028
As the storm blows in,

39:14.030 --> 39:16.364
lightning flashes
across the sky.

39:16.366 --> 39:20.902
As Grumpy cringes, Harry the
Horse trots to the river bank.

39:20.904 --> 39:24.207
Grumpy Gator,
Grumpy Gator,

39:24.209 --> 39:26.343
swim on over here.

39:26.345 --> 39:29.178
I'm a big, healthy horse

39:29.180 --> 39:32.982
who can help you
with your fears.

39:32.984 --> 39:35.919
How can you, a...

39:35.921 --> 39:39.022
delicious-looking,

39:39.024 --> 39:41.323
tasty horse...

39:41.325 --> 39:43.963
help me get over my fears?

39:44.863 --> 39:48.465
Grumpy Gator was so hungry

39:48.467 --> 39:51.001
he forgot about
the rat and frog,

39:51.003 --> 39:52.969
slipped back
into the water,

39:52.971 --> 39:55.907
and swam towards
Harry Horse,

39:55.909 --> 39:58.909
dreaming about
the satisfying meal

39:58.911 --> 40:01.179
he was about to eat.

40:01.181 --> 40:03.346
But before he could
reach the shore,

40:03.348 --> 40:07.018
a huge crack of thunder

40:07.020 --> 40:09.052
rattled his scales.

40:09.054 --> 40:12.291
Grumpy shook with fear.

40:12.293 --> 40:17.428
Chase the lightning away,
and I will let you go.

40:17.430 --> 40:20.432
But tomorrow, I will eat you...

40:22.336 --> 40:25.336
nice and slow.

40:25.338 --> 40:29.474
But Harry did not offer
to scare the lightning away.

40:29.476 --> 40:32.077
He did not try
to cross the river.

40:32.079 --> 40:35.248
Instead, he held his head high

40:35.250 --> 40:37.920
and waited for the
next lightning strike.

40:38.853 --> 40:42.087
Grumpy Gator,
alligator,

40:42.089 --> 40:45.592
scales so fast and strong,

40:45.594 --> 40:49.996
swim to me,
my tasty dinner.

40:49.998 --> 40:51.864
Don't keep me waiting long.

40:55.337 --> 40:59.240
Grumpy Gator was so scared,

40:59.242 --> 41:01.941
he swam fast and far

41:01.943 --> 41:06.412
and was never seen
or heard from again.

41:06.414 --> 41:10.885
And the three friends
were able to cross the river,

41:10.887 --> 41:14.287
back and forth,
and up and down

41:14.289 --> 41:17.023
whenever, wherever
they wanted,

41:17.025 --> 41:21.028
and they lived
happily ever after.

41:21.030 --> 41:23.665
The children will love
that story.

41:23.667 --> 41:25.933
It's kind of like
a scary fable,

41:25.935 --> 41:30.105
folk tale, and adventure
all rolled into one.

41:30.107 --> 41:33.040
I'm so glad I could take you

41:33.042 --> 41:36.011
to the middle of the
children's new story.

41:36.013 --> 41:38.145
Is it the middle
of the story already?

41:38.147 --> 41:40.147
Time to see the mermaid!

41:40.149 --> 41:43.685
Cassandra the mermaid
who lives beneath the sea?

41:43.687 --> 41:44.620
That's the one.

41:44.622 --> 41:49.224
She always grants us
three story wishes.

41:49.226 --> 41:52.394
Can't wait to hear them.
Good luck!

42:06.443 --> 42:09.512
It's Victor. He's eating
the edited part of our story.

42:09.514 --> 42:11.681
The part about Sounder Rabbit?

42:11.683 --> 42:13.183
He's so noisy.

42:13.185 --> 42:16.185
Vultures are very noisy
when they eat.

42:16.187 --> 42:18.721
After Axel and Scout
visited the farm fields

42:18.723 --> 42:23.326
to solve the mystery of Farmer
McAdoo's missing vegetables,

42:23.328 --> 42:26.462
they learned Sounder
Rabbit lied to them.

42:26.464 --> 42:29.232
He was the one
who stole the vegetables.

42:29.234 --> 42:31.167
This led to a story edit

42:31.169 --> 42:35.440
where Victor Vulture with his
assistant, Stunt the airplane,

42:35.442 --> 42:38.342
ripped the chapter out of
the children's new story.

42:38.344 --> 42:39.577
It was upsetting,

42:39.579 --> 42:42.012
but it had to be done.

42:42.014 --> 42:45.182
Dumpty Donkey told them
a scary story

42:45.184 --> 42:48.152
about a hungry rat,
frog, and horse

42:48.154 --> 42:50.554
who tricked a grumpy alligator

42:50.556 --> 42:54.157
into letting them cross
a wide river,

42:54.159 --> 42:58.162
so they could eat the fruit
and grass on the other side.

42:58.164 --> 43:02.734
Everyone lived happily ever after.

43:02.736 --> 43:03.970
Now, Horse Play...

43:03.972 --> 43:07.740
The only super-duper story
service in the entire universe,

43:07.742 --> 43:11.743
must dive into the ocean,
swim beneath the sea,

43:11.745 --> 43:13.611
and find Cassandra
the mermaid,

43:13.613 --> 43:16.714
who can grant them
three story wishes.

43:16.716 --> 43:18.350
Ready, Scout?

43:18.352 --> 43:19.386
Ready.

43:33.235 --> 43:37.103
I forgot how beautiful
it is down here.

43:37.105 --> 43:40.239
Axel and Scout
sail through the water,

43:40.241 --> 43:42.541
admiring the fish and coral,

43:42.543 --> 43:44.543
while searching for
Cassandra the mermaid,

43:44.545 --> 43:47.751
who can grant them
three story wishes.

43:50.385 --> 43:53.287
A tale spun
here, a tale spun there.

43:53.289 --> 43:55.455
Story treasures everywhere.

43:55.457 --> 43:59.727
Mermaids call up from the deep
memories the sea doth keep.

43:59.729 --> 44:03.097
Axel and Scout, what
brings you to the sea?

44:03.099 --> 44:04.298
The children.

44:04.300 --> 44:06.499
We were hoping you would
grant us three story wishes.

44:06.501 --> 44:10.105
Come closer, my friends,
and I'll tell you three tales.

44:10.107 --> 44:15.143
So, close your eyes and
imagine a hen and a hare.

44:15.145 --> 44:18.279
Once upon a time, there was
a hen named Henrietta.

44:18.281 --> 44:21.817
She was the chattiest,
friendliest animal on the farm.

44:21.819 --> 44:25.619
She hosted birthday parties,
always helped animals in need.

44:25.621 --> 44:29.090
Every morning,
she sang the same song.

44:29.092 --> 44:33.094
♪ Gather round,
my farm friends ♪

44:33.096 --> 44:35.832
♪ Feathered,

44:35.834 --> 44:39.401

44:39.403 --> 44:42.306
♪ Our super-happy herd ♪

44:43.307 --> 44:45.774
Yes, everyone loved Henrietta.

44:45.776 --> 44:48.244
Everyone except...

44:48.246 --> 44:50.278
Harvey Hare.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.814
Harvey was an old,
grouchy, long-eared rabbit

44:52.816 --> 44:55.184
who lived in a hole
near the chicken coop.

44:55.186 --> 44:57.654
He had lost all his
family years ago

44:57.656 --> 45:01.324
and had become quite selfish
and downright unsociable.

45:01.326 --> 45:06.163
He hated hearing Henrietta Hen cluck
laughing with the other farm animals.

45:06.165 --> 45:09.232
He couldn't stand her sunny,
friendly disposition.

45:09.234 --> 45:13.303
He would pop out of his hole whenever
there was a party and yell...

45:13.305 --> 45:17.507
Keep away from my hole,
you noisy, scrappy hen!

45:17.509 --> 45:20.643
Your constant clucking
hurts my ears.

45:20.645 --> 45:22.646
Your coop, I want to rend.

45:22.648 --> 45:26.483
One day, Harvey Hare awoke
to the sound of laughter,

45:26.485 --> 45:29.586
and decided he had to do something
about it once and for all.

45:29.588 --> 45:33.590
He jumped out of his hole, and
hopped in front of Henrietta Hen.

45:33.592 --> 45:35.726
I challenge you to a race.

45:35.728 --> 45:39.264
If I win, you have to move
to the other side of the farm.

45:39.266 --> 45:41.798
If you win, I'll dig a
hole near the road,

45:41.800 --> 45:42.869
and you'll never see me again.

45:44.271 --> 45:46.272
Henrietta Hen was shocked.

45:46.274 --> 45:50.209
She had no idea
Harvey Hare was so angry.

45:50.211 --> 45:53.379
I'll race you
on one condition.

45:53.381 --> 45:55.247
If I win,

45:55.249 --> 46:00.419
you have to promise to attend all
my parties and social events

46:00.421 --> 46:03.189
for one full year.

46:03.191 --> 46:06.658
Okay, you're on.

46:06.660 --> 46:08.761
We race from here to the road.

46:08.763 --> 46:12.965
Now, everyone knows that a hen can't
possibly run as fast as a hare.

46:12.967 --> 46:16.570
Still, Henrietta, always
positive, didn't listen

46:16.572 --> 46:19.606
to the other animals who said
she had no chance of winning.

46:19.608 --> 46:22.374
I'm one of your closest friends.

46:22.376 --> 46:26.246
Please call off the race.
You can't possible win.

46:26.248 --> 46:29.648
Where will you move?
Where will you go?

46:29.650 --> 46:31.517
But Henrietta wouldn't listen.

46:31.519 --> 46:33.186
News spread fast.

46:33.188 --> 46:37.160
And on the day of the race, all the farm
animals gathered around the chicken coop.

46:37.859 --> 46:39.794
Harvey Hare took off in a shot,

46:39.796 --> 46:42.395
leaving poor Henrietta
covered in dust.

46:42.397 --> 46:46.299
Still, she kept on strutting,
egged on by the other animals,

46:46.301 --> 46:49.405
her skinny, chicken legs moving
as fast as they could.

46:50.606 --> 46:53.307
Harvey Hare ran
at a comfortable pace.

46:53.309 --> 46:56.276
Halfway to the road,
he reached a fish pond.

46:56.278 --> 46:59.816
Thirsty, he bent over to lap some
water and caught his reflection.

47:01.451 --> 47:03.585
Could that face really be mine?

47:03.587 --> 47:06.320
Is this what happens over time?

47:06.322 --> 47:07.788
Who is that sad, scowling hare?

47:07.790 --> 47:11.228
Is it me, that creature
with a mad, angry stare?

47:12.295 --> 47:16.565
Mesmerized by his image,
Harvey grew sad, then tired.

47:16.567 --> 47:19.367
And before long,
he fell asleep.

47:19.369 --> 47:21.370
Henrietta was getting tired.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.406
She clucked
to keep herself awake.

47:23.408 --> 47:26.709
Cheered on by her farm friends,
she kept on going.

47:26.711 --> 47:29.011
Oh, no! Did I fall asleep?

47:29.013 --> 47:32.582
Harvey Hare woke to hear
the farm animals cheering.

47:32.584 --> 47:35.785
He hopped as fast as his strong,
rabbit legs could carry him

47:35.787 --> 47:40.289
in time to see Henrietta Hen
about to cross the finish line.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.792
In one big leap,
he tried to catch her,

47:42.794 --> 47:46.063
but it was too late.
Henrietta won.

47:46.065 --> 47:49.565
The next day, Henrietta Hen
approached Harvey Hare.

47:49.567 --> 47:54.637
I know you promised to come to my parties
for a year if you lost the race,

47:54.639 --> 47:57.875
but I won't hold you to it.

47:57.877 --> 48:01.911
Just come to one
party just once.

48:01.913 --> 48:05.616
Harvey Hare, taken aback
by Henrietta Hen's kind offer,

48:05.618 --> 48:08.351
reluctantly attended
the next farm party.

48:08.353 --> 48:10.021
And guess what?
He liked it.

48:10.023 --> 48:11.189
It took quite a few months,

48:11.191 --> 48:14.591
but slowly, he came to know
a lot of the farm animals,

48:14.593 --> 48:17.461
and he was never lonely again.

48:17.463 --> 48:20.564
The children like when
stories have a happy ending.

48:20.566 --> 48:21.865
So do I.

48:21.867 --> 48:23.100
Can you tell us another?

48:23.102 --> 48:24.501
Let me think.

48:24.503 --> 48:26.706
Have I told you
about the cow and the bull?

48:28.842 --> 48:32.644
I'm sick of having to struggle

48:32.646 --> 48:35.848
to find a bit of grass.

48:35.850 --> 48:38.984
I'm hungry.

48:38.986 --> 48:40.886
I need more to eat.

48:40.888 --> 48:44.357
The grass is always
hard to find this time of year.

48:44.359 --> 48:48.694
Another month or two, the ground will
warm, the spring rains will come,

48:48.696 --> 48:51.697
and a lush field of grass
will grow beneath our feet.

48:51.699 --> 48:55.768
Every year, you say that,

48:55.770 --> 48:58.472
but it's not true.

48:58.474 --> 49:03.642
The last few years,
our meadow has been dry.

49:03.644 --> 49:08.148
We're running out
of grass to eat.

49:08.150 --> 49:10.717
The next day, Toughie
awoke with an idea.

49:10.719 --> 49:14.887
He told Pearl to walk to the edge of
the meadow, climb the steep hillside,

49:14.889 --> 49:17.124
and venture through
the dark forest.

49:17.126 --> 49:20.626
Beyond the forest lies a farm.

49:20.628 --> 49:25.966
I'm sure the farmer there
will trade your milk for seeds.

49:25.968 --> 49:28.469
We will plant those seeds

49:28.471 --> 49:32.607
and grow more grass.

49:32.609 --> 49:34.442
Reluctantly, Pearl agreed.

49:34.444 --> 49:37.645
She walked and walked until she
reached the edge of the meadow.

49:37.647 --> 49:39.781
Wearily, she climbed
the hillside

49:39.783 --> 49:42.116
and looked back
over her beloved meadow.

49:42.118 --> 49:44.118
In the distance,
she could see Toughie,

49:44.120 --> 49:47.488
his huge bull body moving
through the dry field.

49:47.490 --> 49:50.425
Sighing, she continued
to walk into the forest.

49:50.427 --> 49:53.128
The woods were dark,
and she grew afraid.

49:53.130 --> 49:56.532
But Pearl knew she couldn't return
to the meadow without seeds,

49:56.534 --> 49:57.900
so she kept on going.

49:57.902 --> 50:01.936
In the distance, she saw a goat
grazing in a rich field of grass.

50:01.938 --> 50:06.008
Oh, my! What a beautiful field
of grass to graze in!

50:06.010 --> 50:07.642
Sure is!

50:07.644 --> 50:10.013
Name is Nicky.
Help yourself.

50:10.015 --> 50:12.582
Pearl was so hungry
from her journey

50:12.584 --> 50:15.051
she happily joined the goat
for a nice meal.

50:15.053 --> 50:17.790
Between bites,
she told Nicky her problem.

50:18.890 --> 50:21.124
No need to find the farmer.

50:21.126 --> 50:25.928
I'll trade you some milk
for some magical seeds.

50:25.930 --> 50:28.698
Magical seeds?

50:28.700 --> 50:30.600
Powerful magic!

50:30.602 --> 50:35.706
Plant two of these seeds, and
you'll soon have a blanket of grass

50:35.708 --> 50:38.775
like the one you're standing on.

50:40.112 --> 50:46.150
Plenty for you and a big bull
like Toughie to eat for months.

50:46.152 --> 50:47.851
But beware!

50:47.853 --> 50:53.157
Do not plant more than
two seeds at one time.

50:53.159 --> 50:58.263
This grass is very magical
and grows very fast.

50:58.265 --> 51:00.564
Pearl traded her milk
for 10 seeds

51:00.566 --> 51:02.700
and walked back
through the forest,

51:02.702 --> 51:06.937
down the hillside, across the meadow
until finally reaching Toughie.

51:06.939 --> 51:09.508
Exhausted, she told him what
had happened.

51:09.510 --> 51:13.178
Impatient, he scratched at the
small sack the goat had given her.

51:13.180 --> 51:17.249
Patience, Toughie! We can only
plant two seeds at a time.

51:17.251 --> 51:20.051
Okay! Don't have a cow fit!

51:20.053 --> 51:23.655
Give me two seeds.

51:23.657 --> 51:26.958
Toughie tossed the seeds
on the ground.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.828
The next morning,
Pearl and Toughie awoke

51:28.830 --> 51:31.596
to find short, stubby patches
of grass covering the meadow.

51:31.598 --> 51:34.634
Toughie nibbled a few bites,
growled, unsatisfied.

51:34.636 --> 51:37.904
What kind of magic is this?

51:37.906 --> 51:40.907
You were fooled, hoodwinked.

51:40.909 --> 51:43.643
Two seeds are not enough.

51:43.645 --> 51:45.745
The next day,
Pearl and Toughie awoke

51:45.747 --> 51:48.814
to a blanket of
beautiful, green grass.

51:48.816 --> 51:52.586
See? I told you.

52:02.030 --> 52:04.097
Mmm!

52:04.099 --> 52:10.138
Delicious!

52:10.140 --> 52:13.641
Toughie ripped the new blades of grass
out of the ground and ate and ate.

52:13.643 --> 52:15.009
Then he ate some more.

52:15.011 --> 52:16.777
Pearl joined him hesitantly.

52:16.779 --> 52:19.246
Relieved when the day ended,
and nothing had happened.

52:19.248 --> 52:22.951
The following day, they awoke to
find an even thicker field of grass

52:22.953 --> 52:24.585
that tickled their hooves.

52:24.587 --> 52:27.221
Toughie and Pearl enjoyed
the day grazing.

52:27.223 --> 52:31.092
Toughie ate, and ate,
and ate, happily munching,

52:31.094 --> 52:33.762
and then he ate some more.

52:33.764 --> 52:38.099
On the third day, they awoke to
find the grass had grown even more.

52:38.101 --> 52:39.767
Now, it was
as high as their knees.

52:39.769 --> 52:41.970
What did I tell you, Pearl?

52:41.972 --> 52:47.108
Look at all this grass.

52:47.110 --> 52:49.677
The grass is growing
too fast, Toughie.

52:49.679 --> 52:51.613
We should have listened
to Nicky the goat.

52:51.615 --> 52:53.782
We planted too many
seeds at once.

52:53.784 --> 52:56.017
Let's leave the meadow
and find another field.

52:56.019 --> 52:58.087
The grass there
might not be sparse,

52:58.089 --> 52:59.922
but come spring...

53:02.828 --> 53:07.330
Nonsense!
I'm not going anywhere!

53:07.332 --> 53:13.303
The grass is tall,
and lush, and yummy.

53:15.172 --> 53:17.774
Stop worrying and enjoy it.

53:17.776 --> 53:19.908
But Pearl could
not stop worrying,

53:19.910 --> 53:21.912
and Toughie could
not stop eating.

53:21.914 --> 53:25.715
He ate, and ate, and ate,
and then he ate some more.

53:25.717 --> 53:27.952
No matter how much he ate,

53:27.954 --> 53:31.287
every day, they awoke to find
the grass had grown taller.

53:31.289 --> 53:33.657
In one day, the grass
grew to their shoulders.

53:33.659 --> 53:36.994
The next day, the blades of
grass reached their mouths.

53:36.996 --> 53:38.295
Pearl was alarmed.

53:38.297 --> 53:41.097
She begged Toughie
to move to another field,

53:41.099 --> 53:42.666
but Toughie refused.

53:42.668 --> 53:44.101
Look, Pearl,

53:44.103 --> 53:49.707
I don't even have
to move my mouth.

53:49.709 --> 53:52.646
I just open it and eat.

53:53.446 --> 53:56.915
The following day, they awoke
to find the grass so high

53:56.917 --> 54:00.185
Toughie had to raise his head
to eat breakfast.

54:00.187 --> 54:01.854
Pearl knew she had
to do something.

54:01.856 --> 54:05.723
She tried to convince Toughie to accompany
her to the farm to see Nicky the goat,

54:05.725 --> 54:07.792
hoping he could
reverse the spell,

54:07.794 --> 54:09.262
but Toughie refused.

54:09.264 --> 54:11.764
Busy gobbling up
ever blade in sight.

54:11.766 --> 54:13.465
Sadly, Pearl left.

54:13.467 --> 54:14.867
She walked and walked,

54:14.869 --> 54:18.336
and when she reached the edge of
the meadow, she climbed the hill.

54:18.338 --> 54:20.375
Looking out, she could
not even see Toughie.

54:21.742 --> 54:24.476
Toughie, can you hear me?

54:24.478 --> 54:27.345
The grass was so high
it swallowed the meadow.

54:27.347 --> 54:29.382
Toughie was nowhere in sight.

54:29.384 --> 54:31.983
Exhausted, Pearl walked
through the forest

54:31.985 --> 54:33.787
towards the farm
where she had met the goat.

54:33.789 --> 54:36.857
Nicky, I'm so glad I found you.

54:36.859 --> 54:40.993
The grass has grown so high in the meadow.
We cannot see out.

54:40.995 --> 54:44.397
It's so tough we can barely
get our teeth through it.

54:44.399 --> 54:49.903
I warned you not to plant
more than two seeds at a time.

54:49.905 --> 54:54.274
I told you
they were magical seeds.

54:54.276 --> 54:56.276
I know. We made a mistake.

54:56.278 --> 54:58.279
Please help us.

54:58.281 --> 55:02.217
You were impatient, greedy.

55:02.219 --> 55:04.853
Now, the only thing you can do

55:04.855 --> 55:08.322
is to leave the meadow forever

55:08.324 --> 55:13.128
and be happy to dine on the
short, stubby patches of grass

55:13.130 --> 55:16.431
until spring rains arrive.

55:16.433 --> 55:19.534
Pearl walked as fast
as her cow legs would allow her,

55:19.536 --> 55:21.903
hoping to find Toughie and
convince him to leave the meadow.

55:21.905 --> 55:26.008
She walked and walked until she reached
the hillside overlooking the field.

55:26.010 --> 55:27.943
Gazing out, she gasped

55:27.945 --> 55:30.446
as she saw the green
grass had withered,

55:30.448 --> 55:32.847
leaving dying leaves
weeds in its place.

55:32.849 --> 55:35.917
Toughie, can you hear me?

55:35.919 --> 55:39.053
Pearl called again and again,
but Toughie didn't answer.

55:39.055 --> 55:41.022
She was about to give up hope

55:41.024 --> 55:44.026
when the crackling crunch of dead
leaves caught her attention.

55:44.028 --> 55:46.029
Toughie tromped toward her.

55:46.031 --> 55:48.098
Toughie, are you okay?

55:48.100 --> 55:52.935
You were right, Pearl.
I was impatient, greedy.

55:52.937 --> 55:55.304
I should have listened to you.

55:55.306 --> 55:58.574
I promise if you
let me walk with you

55:58.576 --> 56:02.212
to find another field,

56:02.214 --> 56:06.348
I will eat
the sparse, stubby grass

56:06.350 --> 56:09.086
until spring rains come.

56:09.088 --> 56:12.423
I will be happy
with what we have

56:12.425 --> 56:17.160
and shall never complain again.

56:19.264 --> 56:20.932
Yes, my dear Toughie,

56:20.934 --> 56:24.468
let's walk as far as we must
to find another field.

56:24.470 --> 56:27.370
But don't make a promise
you cannot keep.

56:27.372 --> 56:32.142
For just as the spring rains will turn
our dry meadow into a blanket of grass,

56:32.144 --> 56:35.580
you will always find something
to complain about.

56:35.582 --> 56:38.217
Why, what a fun, little tale!

56:38.219 --> 56:39.152
Do you have another?

56:39.154 --> 56:42.020
I have one more tale
for your new story.

56:42.022 --> 56:45.324
Then, you must promise to leave
and find your own ending.

56:45.326 --> 56:47.359
New story endings
are easy to find.

56:47.361 --> 56:50.261
It's the middle of the story
that requires the most work.

56:50.263 --> 56:51.629
Then close your eyes.

56:51.631 --> 56:53.565
I will grant your last wish

56:53.567 --> 56:55.533
and help you travel
to another story.

56:55.535 --> 56:57.135
How sad!

56:57.137 --> 56:59.040
Is this a really sad story?

57:00.608 --> 57:02.175
Don't interrupt.

57:02.177 --> 57:04.910
One day,
a storm capsized a boat.

57:04.912 --> 57:08.947
Strong tides carried the only two
survivors to the exotic jungle,

57:08.949 --> 57:13.952
a loyal, obedient dog
and a smart, sassy cat.

57:13.954 --> 57:15.488
The cat's name was DeeDee,

57:15.490 --> 57:18.458
a Siamese cat
with bright green eyes

57:18.460 --> 57:21.261
and a very sarcastic
disposition.

57:21.263 --> 57:23.096
The dog's name was Rex,

57:23.098 --> 57:26.466
a happy, friendly animal
with a sunny disposition.

57:26.468 --> 57:28.902
Of all the islands
in all the world,

57:28.904 --> 57:33.239
I have to wind up on this one
with a big, slobbering dog.

57:33.241 --> 57:34.607
That I am.

57:34.609 --> 57:37.344
Name is Rex.
What's your name?

57:37.346 --> 57:40.948
Ugh! DeeDee. Now, go away.
I wanna be alone.

57:40.950 --> 57:44.585
Why? We are lucky
to have each other.

57:44.587 --> 57:47.054
There's no
"we", you foolish dog.

57:47.056 --> 57:49.423
I'm a cat.
We're lone animals.

57:49.425 --> 57:51.325
Now, go away!

57:51.327 --> 57:53.394
For days, the cat
avoided the dog,

57:53.396 --> 57:56.231
thinking she would
do better on her own.

57:56.233 --> 57:57.266
But this jungle was dangerous,

57:57.268 --> 57:59.534
and DeeDee soon found
herself looking for Rex.

57:59.536 --> 58:02.536
She didn't have to look far,
since Rex was lonely

58:02.538 --> 58:05.307
and had been following her,
tracking her scent.

58:05.309 --> 58:08.075
The children will
love this story.

58:08.077 --> 58:11.980
Many boys and girls have
pet cats, and dogs, or both.

58:11.982 --> 58:14.350
If we want
to survive this jungle,

58:14.352 --> 58:16.651
we have to work together.

58:16.653 --> 58:20.990
Meow. I told you. Cats
don't like the word "we".

58:20.992 --> 58:23.558
Okay.

58:23.560 --> 58:25.995
But I am very thirsty.

58:25.997 --> 58:28.029
Maybe just this one time,

58:28.031 --> 58:31.100
we could work together to find
some fresh water to drink.

58:31.102 --> 58:34.503
I'm thirsty too.

58:34.505 --> 58:36.739
In fact, DeeDee the cat
was so thirsty

58:36.741 --> 58:39.141
she knew she would not last long

58:39.143 --> 58:42.012
if she didn't find fresh water
to drink soon.

58:42.014 --> 58:43.746
Any suggestions?

58:43.748 --> 58:44.882
You're a cat.

58:44.884 --> 58:47.550
You can climb to a high branch
of one of these trees

58:47.552 --> 58:50.587
and see where we might find
a fresh lake or pond.

58:50.589 --> 58:52.655
DeeDee thought
this was an excellent idea.

58:52.657 --> 58:55.391
She couldn't believe she
hadn't thought of it herself.

58:55.393 --> 58:58.528
She quickly jumped onto one
of the jungle's giant trees,

58:58.530 --> 59:00.263
grasped the bark
with her claws,

59:00.265 --> 59:02.265
and nimbly climbed the branches

59:02.267 --> 59:04.002
until she reached
the top of the tree.

59:04.004 --> 59:06.636
At once, she saw
a fresh, glistening lake

59:06.638 --> 59:08.506
not too far
from where they were.

59:08.508 --> 59:12.075
But when DeeDee tried
to climb down, she couldn't.

59:12.077 --> 59:13.310
She couldn't get down?

59:13.312 --> 59:15.546
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

59:15.548 --> 59:19.182
DeeDee had been a house cat and
didn't have much outdoor experience.

59:19.184 --> 59:21.020
While her sharp
claws allowed her

59:21.022 --> 59:23.221
to scurry up the tree
trunk quite easily,

59:23.223 --> 59:26.391
they didn't work as well
when she turned to climb down.

59:26.393 --> 59:28.192
Rex craned his neck to see her.

59:28.194 --> 59:31.195
- You okay?
- I'm not sure how to get down.

59:31.197 --> 59:33.665
Why not do exactly what
you did going up the tree

59:33.667 --> 59:35.266
only in reverse?

59:35.268 --> 59:37.536
You mean climb backwards?

59:37.538 --> 59:39.371
Why not?

59:39.373 --> 59:43.141
DeeDee tried Rex's suggestion and
was on the ground in no time.

59:43.143 --> 59:46.312
Maybe you aren't such a worthless
dog after all.

59:46.314 --> 59:50.216
From the high tree top, I spotted a
freshwater lake not far from here.

59:52.053 --> 59:54.553
I think it's this way,
but I don't smell it yet.

59:54.555 --> 59:57.423
Point me in the right direction,
and I'll find the lake.

59:57.425 --> 01:00:00.325
We dogs have
a highly sensitive nose,

01:00:00.327 --> 01:00:02.562
a great sense of smell.

01:00:02.564 --> 01:00:05.097
Rex, nose to the ground,
followed the cat's lead,

01:00:05.099 --> 01:00:09.136
and soon enough, his great sense of
smell led them right to the lake.

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:12.406
Rex lapped the water with his
tongue, slobbering, splashing

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:16.409
while DeeDee delicately drank the
water until she had her fill.

01:00:16.411 --> 01:00:18.245
Now, I'm hungry.

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:19.813
Me, too.

01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:22.149
I would love to eat
a big chunk of meat.

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:25.585
Although, a mouthful of grass
would fill me up as well.

01:00:25.587 --> 01:00:28.489
I don't eat plants,
but I do love meat.

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:30.723
We have many differences,

01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:33.528
but we also share
many of the same traits.

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:35.664
We are both mammals.
We have fur.

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:37.798
We drink milk
when we're babies.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.501
But we're also very different.

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:41.869
You slobber when you drink.
I'm very delicate.

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:44.106
I can climb and jump.
You can't.

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:47.209
I have a better sense of smell
and more teeth.

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:51.146
But it is our differences that
can help us survive the jungle.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.782
I hunt at night, so I can find
us food when you're sleeping.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.684
I'll prepare breakfast.

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:58.254
And I prefer to hunt
during the day.

01:00:58.256 --> 01:01:00.422
You will never go to bed hungry.

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:03.725
Once Rex and DeeDee celebrated
their individual strengths,

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:05.328
they began to work together.

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:08.131
Many years later, they were
rescued from the jungle,

01:01:08.133 --> 01:01:09.866
but neither of them
forgot each other,

01:01:09.868 --> 01:01:11.833
nor the power of their teamwork.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:14.536
Now, that's a tale with a moral!

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:15.670
The end.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.339
I liked that story too.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:20.644
Now, it's time
for you two to resurface

01:01:20.646 --> 01:01:22.778
and find a happy ending
for your new story.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.481
The children are waiting,

01:01:24.483 --> 01:01:27.187
and I can't wait to hear
what happens next.

01:01:39.898 --> 01:01:42.766
Sorry, cuz, time for me
to chase you down.

01:01:42.768 --> 01:01:45.435
Can't let you end the story.
Victor is getting hungry.

01:01:45.437 --> 01:01:48.473
We gave you all the story
you're gonna get, Stunt.

01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:49.540
Out of our way, Stunt.

01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:51.176
No can do.

01:01:51.178 --> 01:01:54.578
Come on! Don't be greedy.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.781
You boys got most of the story.

01:01:56.783 --> 01:02:01.486
You don't really want one of them
silly, happy endings, do you?

01:02:01.488 --> 01:02:03.687
Let me end the story...

01:02:03.689 --> 01:02:05.425
by eating it.

01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:09.195
- That was a close one, Scout.
- Sure was.

01:02:09.197 --> 01:02:11.697
We'd better finish this story
as fast as we can.

01:02:11.699 --> 01:02:15.300
Where are we?
They blew us off course.

01:02:15.302 --> 01:02:17.202
No matter.
Stories are like taffy.

01:02:17.204 --> 01:02:19.405
There's always another
way to twist it.

01:02:19.407 --> 01:02:21.739
Let's end
at the Enchanted Forest.

01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:25.844
Why, that's brilliant! We'll end
the story where the story began.

01:02:25.846 --> 01:02:26.882
Full circle!

01:02:27.983 --> 01:02:31.282
Barney Owl was flying
through the Enchanted Forest

01:02:31.284 --> 01:02:34.421
when a boy with brown hair and
freckles called out to him.

01:02:34.423 --> 01:02:37.723
We'll find the boy
and our happy ending.

01:02:37.725 --> 01:02:41.894
♪ Fly high
Fly low ♪

01:02:41.896 --> 01:02:44.598
♪ Soar and away ♪

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.933
♪ We must find
our happy ending ♪

01:02:47.935 --> 01:02:54.577
♪ And save the day ♪

01:02:58.413 --> 01:03:01.315
Before we find the boy,
let's end with something fun.

01:03:01.317 --> 01:03:03.717
Yes, I love Fantasy Island.

01:03:03.719 --> 01:03:05.920
We always find
a new character here.

01:03:05.922 --> 01:03:08.288
His tail is like
a baby T-Rex.

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:10.824
His head kind of looks
like a giant lizard.

01:03:10.826 --> 01:03:12.726
His scales are like a snake.

01:03:12.728 --> 01:03:15.295
Children love new dinosaurs!

01:03:15.297 --> 01:03:17.998
Especially dinosaurs
with wings that can fly.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.766
Let's go see
if he's friendly.

01:03:20.903 --> 01:03:22.903
Hey, I'm Axel.
This here is Scout.

01:03:22.905 --> 01:03:24.171
We're Horse Play,

01:03:24.173 --> 01:03:28.276
the only super-duper delivery
story service in the universe.

01:03:28.278 --> 01:03:30.879
We're about to deliver
one of our super-duper stories

01:03:30.881 --> 01:03:33.615
to a boy who lives nearby
in the Enchanted Forest.

01:03:33.617 --> 01:03:36.584
We were looking for one more
character to end the story.

01:03:36.586 --> 01:03:39.854
Then we spotted you.
Children love dinosaurs.

01:03:39.856 --> 01:03:42.423
I'm afraid the children
won't like me.

01:03:42.425 --> 01:03:44.393
- Why not?
- No one likes me.

01:03:44.395 --> 01:03:47.063
The dinosaurs tease me
because I'm not big enough.

01:03:47.065 --> 01:03:51.433
The lizards laugh at me because they think
I'm too big to be a lizard or a snake.

01:03:51.435 --> 01:03:53.069
It's hard being me.

01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:54.069
Aww! Cheer up!

01:03:54.071 --> 01:03:56.471
You might not be as big
as the other dinosaurs,

01:03:56.473 --> 01:04:00.076
but there is only one of you
in the entire universe.

01:04:00.078 --> 01:04:03.779
Children love finding new dinosaurs.
Come with us.

01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:06.715
Axel, wait!
He's not a...

01:04:08.018 --> 01:04:10.954
A dinosaur that roars fire.

01:04:10.956 --> 01:04:13.624
Cool!

01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:15.693
Now, we have every
story element we need

01:04:15.695 --> 01:04:19.463
to find the boy
and finish this here story.

01:04:19.465 --> 01:04:23.499
I'm not a dinosaur.
My name is blue, and I'm...

01:04:23.501 --> 01:04:26.769
I know who you are.
I was about to tell Axel.

01:04:26.771 --> 01:04:28.104
You know?

01:04:28.106 --> 01:04:30.407
You was about to tell me what?

01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:32.075
Blue is the dragon
who flew away

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:35.013
from the three fat hogs
on Lava Land.

01:04:35.015 --> 01:04:37.716
You are pretending
to be a dinosaur

01:04:37.718 --> 01:04:40.384
so no one will suspect
who you really are.

01:04:40.386 --> 01:04:41.685
How did you know?

01:04:41.687 --> 01:04:43.120
I heard you sneeze.

01:04:43.122 --> 01:04:45.857
I'd recognize
that sneeze anywhere.

01:04:45.859 --> 01:04:47.091
It's humiliating.

01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:50.495
I can no longer
call myself a dragon.

01:04:50.497 --> 01:04:52.763
Yes, you can.
Don't you see?

01:04:52.765 --> 01:04:55.065
You're a fierce, fiery dragon,

01:04:55.067 --> 01:04:57.570
not a scaly dinosaur fake.

01:04:57.572 --> 01:05:00.639
You open up your mouth,
and the whole world quakes.

01:05:00.641 --> 01:05:04.510
You breathe fire on your enemies
and chase them all away.

01:05:04.512 --> 01:05:08.747
You're a real dragon hero
who just saved the day.

01:05:08.749 --> 01:05:11.050
I did, didn't I?

01:05:11.052 --> 01:05:12.818
There's nothing wrong
with your dragon fire.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.387
You just had a stuffed nose.

01:05:14.389 --> 01:05:17.722
Come with us.
The children love dragons.

01:05:17.724 --> 01:05:19.825
And they'll especially love you,

01:05:19.827 --> 01:05:21.962
because you saved the story.

01:05:21.964 --> 01:05:24.734
You've given them
a happy ending.

01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:29.602
Where's the boy?

01:05:29.604 --> 01:05:32.641
Did you tell him we found
the children a new story?

01:05:34.676 --> 01:05:36.913
Horse Play,
Axel and Scout!

01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:40.647
Super-duper story deliveries
at your service.

01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:43.850
Are the children ready
to hear their new story?

01:05:43.852 --> 01:05:47.057
Oh, yes! We can hardly wait.
Please, begin.

01:05:47.991 --> 01:05:52.025
Once upon a time, there
was an owl named Barney.

01:05:52.027 --> 01:05:53.126
That's me!

01:05:53.128 --> 01:05:56.496
Barney Owl was flying
through the Enchanted Forest

01:05:56.498 --> 01:06:00.601
when a boy with brown hair and
freckles called out to him and said,

01:06:00.603 --> 01:06:02.003
"The children need a new story."

01:06:02.005 --> 01:06:04.871
And here it is.

01:06:04.873 --> 01:06:09.011
It's always good to begin and end
a story with a hearty laugh.

01:06:14.718 --> 01:06:17.084
A horse and an
airplane, what a sight!

01:06:17.086 --> 01:06:20.087
They fly in the day.
They fly through the night.

01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:22.191
Axel the airplane
steers the course

01:06:22.193 --> 01:06:25.127
for his partner and
passenger, Scout the horse.

01:06:25.129 --> 01:06:27.696
Horse Play is
their business name.

01:06:27.698 --> 01:06:32.002
Finding super-duper stories
is their claim to fame.
