12:20.808 --> 12:23.210
This is my old friend
Chunky Kay.

12:23.276 --> 12:27.047
[ Chunky Kay ]
I like a little ice and
lots of Mountain Dew, please.

12:27.114 --> 12:31.318
When you can't have booze,
like me, you get real
particular about your drinks.

12:31.384 --> 12:35.722
Let's see how this is here.
Mmm! That's perfect, Wayne.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.091
You are a great bartender.

12:38.158 --> 12:42.529
- And you are
a very pretty girl.
- Wow, thanks.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.865
- I mean it.
- No, I just--
You know, I don't--

12:44.932 --> 12:49.336
- I don't really care
about looks much, so--
- Beautiful people never do.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.571
Life is funny like that.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.807
- [ Sam ]
Can I ask you a question?
- Hit me.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.043
What were you in prison for?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.978
[ Wayne ]
Maybe that's private, Sammy.

12:58.045 --> 13:01.048
There's nothing
private about me.
You-all are like my family.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.150
In fact,
just call me Aunt Chunky.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.253
[ Cael ]
Okay, Aunt Chunky.
[ Chuckles ]

13:06.319 --> 13:10.023
[ Di Di ]
Yeah, that sounds good,
Aunt Chunky.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.863
I committed a murder, Sam.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.635
My husband used
to beat me real bad.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.138
So one day,
I killed him on accident.

13:25.205 --> 13:29.342
You killed him on accident?

13:29.409 --> 13:33.280
I pray to God
for forgiveness every time
I see a certain kind of knife.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.318
So you went to prison
for murder?
No. Car theft.

13:40.753 --> 13:44.024
Lady Luck was on my side,
and I would've gotten
away with it too...

13:44.091 --> 13:46.759
until I got caught
in a car I didn't own.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.697
That was God's way of saying,
"You don't have
to go so far, Chunky.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.599
Take it easier next time."

13:52.665 --> 13:56.069
Good point, God.
Yes.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.239
God made
an excellent point.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.475
So was Dahlia
all right in prison?

14:02.542 --> 14:06.279
Yes.
She was all right.

14:06.346 --> 14:10.250
The first day
I spent with your mom,
I knew she had personality.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.652
You know what your mom did
in prison to earn money?

14:12.719 --> 14:15.422
- What?
- Palm readin'.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.625
You know,
telling people what
they're gonna do in life.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.929
Life line, money line,
how many kids
they were gonna have.

14:21.995 --> 14:27.267
You would be surprised
at how many fortunes
she came up with for them.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.070
Then one day,
I went to the library,

14:30.137 --> 14:34.807
checked out a book
and realized she was wrong
about the whole thing.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.810
She made the whole thing up.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.447
[ Chuckling ]

14:40.513 --> 14:45.652
When she came into the joint,
I wasn't bored no more.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.288
It was like...

14:48.355 --> 14:52.459
I got to be in her light,
you know?

14:52.525 --> 14:54.394
Yeah.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.839
Dahli, I gotta leave.
You have got
such a great family,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.775
but I gotta go.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.178
What you talking about?
We-We haven't even
eaten yet.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.646
I gotta get home.
If I come late,

15:13.713 --> 15:17.050
- Britney and K-Fed'll
take my spot on the couch.
- Who?

15:17.117 --> 15:21.821
The other tenant's pit bulls.
I mean, they're nice dogs,
but I can't control 'em.

15:21.888 --> 15:25.358
And if they fall asleep
on the couch, then I end up
sleeping on the floor...

15:25.425 --> 15:27.127
because I'm scared
they'll bite me.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.296
They already bit me once.
Look.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.598
Oh, my God.
That's awful.

15:31.664 --> 15:35.068
Shit, you really got
bad luck, man.
[ Chuckles ]

15:35.135 --> 15:37.404
You ever try
throwin' salt?
Throwin' salt?

15:37.470 --> 15:40.107
Girl, that is some sort
of old wives' tale.
No, no, no, no.

15:40.173 --> 15:43.010
It works. Come on.
Let's do it. Let's think
about your luck changin'.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.145
Throw salt.
Is that how you got
this house?

15:45.212 --> 15:47.580
Yeah, kind of.
So let's try it.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.982
Okay.
Okay.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.850
That in there.
I'm gonna
do it too with ya.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.420
Okay, stand on one leg.
Uh-huh, one leg.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.722
Close your eyes.
Lean on me.
Lean on you.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.890
Don't fall over.
Lucky, lucky, lucky,
lucky, lucky!

Throw it!
[ Yells ]

15:59.892 --> 16:02.129
- Goddamn it!
- Oh!

16:02.195 --> 16:04.431
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's salt.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.034
What are you throwing salt
at me for?
Trying to find some luck.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.837
Go wash your eye out, baby.
I'm-- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Goddamn it!

Oh, Chunk, don't go.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.385
Come on. Don't go.
Don't leave me here.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.821
Please, baby.
You gotta stay.
We got so much room here.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.424
I don't wanna send you home
'cause of Britney and K-Fed.

The dumb-ass dogs
are gonna bite you.
It's retarded.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.065
Are you sure your husband
won't mind? I mean,
the man's got an eyeful of salt.

16:38.131 --> 16:41.068
Aw!
Not the first time.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.175
Wayne, I'm excited
about this dinner party,
you know?

16:48.241 --> 16:51.544
I mean, I even went
to the library and I found
a book by Emily Post...

16:51.611 --> 16:55.848
on how to throw a--
a real fancy buffer dinner.

16:55.915 --> 16:59.419
I got a real good recipe.
I'm gonna cook it up
as best I know how.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.554
But I have a right
to have a friend.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.491
So would you stop bein'
so friggin' paranoid?
I am not paranoid.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.993
I am completely
good-humored and relaxed.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.396
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.470
- You are?
- Yeah.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.073
I'm sorry.
I'm just high-strung.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.243
- You think?
- I'm sensitive, you asshole.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.613
- Some mushroom boat? Think we
can make a mushroom boat?
- I think you're mad at me...

17:26.679 --> 17:29.816
and you're just
not expressing it.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.785
Well, she is a risk.

17:32.852 --> 17:38.125
And she is a little freaky.
And I think she's on drugs.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.593
Not to be critical.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.597
Well, what makes you
say that?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.433
Just a feeling I got.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.707
She's my friend, Wayne.

17:54.774 --> 17:59.179
When you go to prison,
people beat the shit
out of you for nothin'.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.783
I was lucky
Chunky was my cellie.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.018
She lived there a long time
before I got there.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.422
There was this one chick,
she was like
three cells down from us.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.725
And I don't know why,
but she hated me.
She tried to kill me.

18:12.792 --> 18:17.830
But Chunky stepped in,
and that bitch never
bothered me again.

18:20.066 --> 18:24.103
She was... noble.

18:24.171 --> 18:27.474
Man, she was noble,
like a noble warrior...

18:27.540 --> 18:30.943

you could imagine.

She protected me.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.849

18:39.152 --> 18:42.789
And now,
she's here in my house.

18:42.855 --> 18:46.726
She's alone,
and she's having
a bad time.

18:49.196 --> 18:52.899
At least in prison,
you don't have to fight
a dog for a bed.

19:23.930 --> 19:28.501
She is in there
looking at Sam's mural.
So?

19:28.568 --> 19:31.137
Probably just thinks
it's a pretty picture.
Oh, yeah.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.573
Chunky Kay is clearly
a lover of art.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.576

all day? You want her
at the dinner party?

I told you she was goin'.
Oh, yeah?

at a sewage treatment facility.

Don't you make fun of her.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.655
I'm not
making fun of her.

I too wanted to supervise
sewage on the weekend.

she could get. Come on.

So she'll be out of here
by noon?
She's gonna go.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.668
She'll be gone by noon.
Okay.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.971
So you can quit sweatin' it.
I'm not sweatin' it.
I'm very calm.

Okay. Don't forget
my pork rinds. Bye-bye.

we had around.
- Yeah.

of Dad's, actually.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.562
And he just left his diploma
at your house?

20:29.629 --> 20:31.931
He's on vacation,
so we're just looking after
a couple things.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.667
We should probably take
better care of that,
'cause if he comes back,

20:34.734 --> 20:37.704
he'll be pissed off
about the thing--
That's a good idea, Cael.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.940
We'd better clean up
this house good today for real.

- Dad's boss is comin'.

If he likes us,
he'll make Dad a partner.
Wow.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.048
- What's that mean?
- Yeah, what does that mean?

20:49.115 --> 20:51.918
It means instead of having
just a piece of the pie,
we might own the whole bakery.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.986

a good impression?

cleaning is fun for me.

to take a chance on me.

a maid anyway?
- I do.

36:42.368 --> 36:44.002
Don't worry about that.
Nobody noticed.

36:44.069 --> 36:47.673
Maybe you should go upstairs
and talk to her
and calm her down.

36:47.739 --> 36:53.044
Oh. You know what?
You-- You take Sam
and go to Brent's house.

36:53.111 --> 36:55.381
Di Di, please.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.850
Okay. Come on, Sam.
Let's take a field trip.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.424
[ Laughing, Chattering ]

37:09.295 --> 37:12.264
I think I hear laughing.
[ Hugh ]
You kiddin'? I love that.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.366
[ Sniffing ]

37:14.433 --> 37:16.735
Ah!
Jesus Christ, Chunky!

37:16.802 --> 37:20.238
What's wrong with you idiots?
Shut the goddamn door!

37:20.306 --> 37:23.542
Oh!
Oh. Missed some.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.844
[ Both Laughing ]
[ Hugh ]
Oh!

37:29.815 --> 37:34.119
[ Grunting ]
Oh, Doug. Mmm!
I like that maid of yours.

37:34.185 --> 37:37.723
She knows how to take a joke.
Little too into
the rabbit thing.

37:37.789 --> 37:41.927
But she's just trying to get by.
People used to laugh about
me and my septic tanks too.

37:41.993 --> 37:45.631
Yeah. Cicatrice is
a wonderful person with
an unbeatable personality.

37:45.697 --> 37:49.000
Do I look high?
Are bears Catholic?

37:49.067 --> 37:51.269
[ Chuckling ]
I am.

37:51.337 --> 37:53.472
Guess you could say
I fell off the wagon.

37:53.539 --> 37:56.742
She offered it to me like candy,
and I could not refuse.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.678
So does snortin'
some kind of white powder
mean I ain't sober no more?

37:59.745 --> 38:01.680
- Last time I checked.
- [ Laughing ]

38:01.747 --> 38:05.016
Well, what the hell!
Let's just, uh--

38:05.083 --> 38:08.086
Let's just go ahead
and sign this thing.

38:08.153 --> 38:10.756
- You wanna make me a partner
right now? Right here?
- Why the hell not?

38:10.822 --> 38:13.124
In business,
we sleep where we shit.
You're lucky, Doug.

38:13.191 --> 38:16.628
I had my doubts about you.
Cicatrice came up with
some good adjectives.

38:16.695 --> 38:20.799
She did?
What were they?

38:20.866 --> 38:23.935
Uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh!
That's between me and Cicatrice.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.905
Come on. Right there
on the dotted line.

38:36.582 --> 38:39.117
- Let's not do this right now.
- You don't wanna be
my partner anymore?

38:39.184 --> 38:42.521
- Yes. No, I do.
- Well, then stop with
the sad sack attitude.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.790
Sign the damn thing!

38:44.856 --> 38:48.126
Wait.
You're right. You're right.
Better idea.

38:48.193 --> 38:50.762
Let's do it
with a toast, huh?

38:50.829 --> 38:55.434
Oh! Let the good times
roll, huh?

38:55.501 --> 38:58.704
[ Chuckles, Mutters ]

38:58.770 --> 39:03.375
Why'd you get him high?
He'd been sober eight years.
Because he deserved it.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.276
He's a son of a bitch.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.847
Cherien.
Now, the lovely Cherien.

39:11.383 --> 39:15.253
The lovely Cicatrice.
All right.

39:15.320 --> 39:19.758
Now, the reason
we're all here tonight--

39:19.825 --> 39:21.827
[ Sniffs ]
Everybody take a sip.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.464
Mmm. Not bad.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.633
Doug here's gonna
scribble his signature,

39:27.699 --> 39:31.937
and then the naked dancin'
will begin, and--

39:32.003 --> 39:33.839
[ Chuckling ]

39:33.905 --> 39:37.609
There you go, Doug.
Time to sign your life away.
[ Clearing Throat ]

39:37.676 --> 39:39.811
Oh. You wanna hold
the pen, Jimbo?

39:39.878 --> 39:41.980
What's that
supposed to mean?

39:42.047 --> 39:44.716
It's supposed to mean
I should take the
writing utensil and sign.

39:44.783 --> 39:47.853
[ Chuckles ]
[ Glasses Clink ]

39:49.421 --> 39:51.389
Come on.
[ Glasses Clink ]

39:51.457 --> 39:54.025
Come on.
Go to it.
[ Wayne ] Yes.

40:03.469 --> 40:06.304
What the hell you waitin' for?
The last page.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.774
Gotta sit.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.511
- Okay, honey?
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.846
He's just kinda
savoring the moment, huh?

40:14.913 --> 40:18.049
When you sign
something like this,
you know you've arrived.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.918
Yes. I'm not sure where,

40:19.985 --> 40:24.122
but I've certainly
arrived at that place.

[ Softly ]
You don't have to.

40:29.595 --> 40:33.264
Right-Right here.

40:33.331 --> 40:35.166
It's okay.
You don't have to.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.569
Oh, shit, Doug.

40:37.636 --> 40:40.972
Takin' so long,
I'm gettin' dizzy.

40:41.039 --> 40:44.910
Do you know what I mean, Jim?
Hold the pen?

40:47.412 --> 40:50.649
I bet you wanna
hold my pen, don't you?

Wait a minute.

Wait a m--

41:00.692 --> 41:04.095
What?
What'd I say?

41:08.500 --> 41:10.936
Maybe later.

41:38.530 --> 41:43.134
[ Chuckles ]
What a horrible dinner party.

41:43.201 --> 41:46.572
Does it matter?

41:46.638 --> 41:48.574
If my husband's gay?

41:48.640 --> 41:50.576
Doesn't matter to me.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.844
Well, you're not his wife.

41:54.913 --> 41:58.784
I should run away from here
and never come back.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.986
I thought
you loved it here.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.691
Well, I love the
guard at the gate part.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.928
And I love the way people
can see our houses...

42:09.995 --> 42:13.699
from one curve in the highway
way off in the distance.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.301
And when they catch a glimpse,
they say to themselves,

42:16.367 --> 42:19.037
"Who in the hell would pay
two million dollars...

42:19.104 --> 42:24.743
just to have them
one of them stupid mansions
up there behind a gate?"

42:24.810 --> 42:27.613
And the answer is...

42:29.280 --> 42:31.216
every single one of 'em.

42:31.282 --> 42:33.585
They're green with jealousy.

42:33.652 --> 42:36.254
I love that part.

42:38.590 --> 42:43.662
Nina, can't you just
pretend he's straight?

42:46.998 --> 42:50.135
All those alpaca conventions,

42:50.201 --> 42:53.939
think they were just about
fur quality and leg hairs?

42:56.842 --> 42:59.911
I've been pretending
for 18 years, Doug.

43:05.350 --> 43:07.285
Not bad.

Everybody went home...
except for that Hugh guy.

I don't really
wanna tell you.

You didn't do too good
with my secrets tonight.

at good-byes,
