00:33.618 --> 00:35.286
Good news, everyone.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.373
Remember when you asked
to see my family tree?

00:38.456 --> 00:39.457
ALL: No.

00:39.541 --> 00:40.792
Ta-da!

00:42.252 --> 00:47.006
This is my ancestor, Philo
Farnsworth, inventor of television,

00:47.090 --> 00:50.552
and as a bonus,
childhood obesity.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.804
And here's Dean Farnsworth,

00:52.887 --> 00:56.516
developer of the Farnsworth
Test for Colorblindness.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.184
Where is he, blast it?

00:58.601 --> 01:01.938
And just recently, I learned
of a modern-day Farnsworth

01:02.021 --> 01:04.566
who invented
the Anti-Senility Truss.

01:04.649 --> 01:05.984
That's you, Professor.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.068
Wha...

01:08.319 --> 01:13.199
Ah, yes, the Farnsworths boast a
proud and distinguished lineage.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.410

on this tree.

01:15.493 --> 01:16.536

01:16.619 --> 01:18.204
(SNORING)
Isn't he your distant uncle?

01:18.288 --> 01:21.165
Very distant. Not a true
Farnsworth, mind you.

01:21.416 --> 01:24.210
He's way over here
on this filthy branch

01:24.335 --> 01:27.171

and dung beetles.

01:28.214 --> 01:29.215

01:29.340 --> 01:31.134
What's with
the 17 dung beetles?

01:31.217 --> 01:32.260
Ugh!
(CHUCKLES)

01:32.343 --> 01:35.972
Well, it's 6:00. I guess we'll have
to deliver that human heart tomorrow.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.932
Good work, people.
Woo-hoo!

01:38.182 --> 01:41.894
Time to go clubbing!
Baby seals, here I come.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.064
Guess I better head over
to my night job.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.899
You have a night job?
Yup.

01:46.983 --> 01:49.402
It's exhausting, but I need
the extra money to buy coffee

01:49.485 --> 01:51.362
so I can stay awake
for my night job.

01:51.571 --> 01:53.197

01:57.994 --> 02:01.372
You've got a surprising amount of
algae in your beard, Mr. President.

02:01.456 --> 02:03.958
Just sit still and let the
algae-eater do its work.

Remember, no loud noise, no
head bowling, and no parties,

02:16.721 --> 02:18.389
or it'll be your ass in a jar.

02:18.556 --> 02:19.932
I want to go to that museum!

02:25.938 --> 02:28.024
Man, this place is a snooze.

02:28.107 --> 02:32.487
Hey, Fry, I challenge President
Taft here to a pie-eating contest.

02:32.570 --> 02:33.821
You're on, skinny.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.783

No fun allowed.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.870
I want me some

to show a little ankle.

The Farnsworths
are a remarkable...

03:54.819 --> 03:56.446
Farnsworth?

03:56.821 --> 03:58.948
That name is a stain
on American history.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.452
One of the worst traitors of the
Revolution was a Farnsworth.

04:02.535 --> 04:03.578
You're lying!

04:03.661 --> 04:04.829
He's George Washington.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.205
He tends not to do that.

04:06.497 --> 04:10.877
David Farnsworth was a notorious
British agent and oounterfeiter.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.672
He conspired to bring down our
nation with his fraudulent currency!

04:15.339 --> 04:18.341
A Farnsworth did this?
Oh, dear!

Yeah-uh.

06:41.444 --> 06:44.196

in a time stasis bubble.

get that lantern?

14:40.047 --> 14:41.632
From that old church
to the north.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.011
They had two burning, so I
figured they wouldn't miss one.
