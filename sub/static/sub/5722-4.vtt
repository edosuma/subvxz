Saul:
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.732 --> 00:03.336
Korzenik: Look at her.

00:03.338 --> 00:05.338
She's getting rich out of this.
Why not us?

00:05.340 --> 00:07.440
Information's for free.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.275
Korzenik: <i> I have a business</i>
<i>opportunity for you.</i>

00:09.277 --> 00:10.743
Something for sale.

00:10.745 --> 00:13.112
Documents. Top secret.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.248
American.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.583
I'll vet them and get them
out just like last time.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.486
How can I reach you?

00:20.488 --> 00:22.689
You can't.

00:23.625 --> 00:25.325
(Computer whooshes)

00:25.327 --> 00:27.794
- (Silly laughter on computer)
- You little fucker.

00:27.796 --> 00:30.496
We're old friends, Saul,
so you should know something.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.266
My government will
actively oppose

00:33.268 --> 00:35.635
any plans for regime change
in Damascus.

00:35.637 --> 00:37.036
We're out of the business

00:37.038 --> 00:38.438
of overthrowing
Arab dictators, Etai.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.206
We have a green light.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.208
How detailed
is their intelligence?

00:42.210 --> 00:44.110
They know Assad is
in the crosshairs.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.879
They know we have a likely
candidate to replace him.

00:46.881 --> 00:51.017
- It was the CIA woman. She was the target.
- Someone wants you dead.

00:51.019 --> 00:53.319
Carrie: <i>I don't know if I can
put her on that plane tomorrow.</i>

00:53.321 --> 00:55.288
Jonas:
<i>Why not go with her?</i>

00:55.290 --> 00:57.390
Carrie: <i> If I do that, she's</i>
<i>no safer than she is here.</i>

00:57.392 --> 00:59.459
You'll get no support,
you'll be out of the Agency.

01:07.969 --> 01:09.235
Carrie:
<i>We have to go.</i>

01:09.237 --> 01:10.636
We have to go right now.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.305
- They're already on their way.
- Who is?

01:12.307 --> 01:13.706
I am saying that
whoever is trying

01:13.708 --> 01:15.141
to kill me is coming here.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.344

03:45.693 --> 03:48.828
We eat <i> maror,</i> the bitter herb,

to remind us
of the bitterness of slavery

03:51.466 --> 03:54.700
our ancestors
endured in Egypt.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.136
And for us,

03:57.138 --> 03:59.372
my family, my friends,

03:59.374 --> 04:01.874
celebrating this Seder
in Germany--

04:01.876 --> 04:04.343
it is important

04:04.345 --> 04:07.847
to remember the slavery
we endured

04:07.849 --> 04:10.483
under a tyrant worse
than pharaoh

04:10.485 --> 04:12.852
only 70 years ago

04:12.854 --> 04:14.720
in this land.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.089
On the streets
where we walk

04:17.091 --> 04:19.225
every day,

04:19.226 --> 04:22.795
our parents and our grandparents
wore yellow stars.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.833
Let's take a moment
to remember.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.340
And let's

04:34.342 --> 04:37.376
remember the enemies we still
have all over the world

04:37.378 --> 04:41.213
who wish to destroy us.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.616
We pray for the strength
to defeat them.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.763

05:28.896 --> 05:31.230
Oh, thank God.

05:31.232 --> 05:33.566
(Panting)

05:36.437 --> 05:38.871
Quinn?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.976
Quinn, untie me.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.948
Quinn, what the fuck
is going on?

05:48.950 --> 05:51.317
Your name's on a kill list.

05:51.319 --> 05:52.852
I-I know.

05:52.854 --> 05:55.321
I-I can't figure it out.

05:55.323 --> 05:57.623
Well, you must have done
something.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.292
Pissed off somebody,

06:00.294 --> 06:01.761
crossed a line somewhere.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.664
Quinn, Quinn, Quinn, no.

06:04.666 --> 06:06.766
- Don't move, Carrie.
- Please. Please! Please! Please!

06:06.768 --> 06:08.134
- Stop moving, Carrie.
- No.

06:08.136 --> 06:10.603
(Panting)

06:10.605 --> 06:13.105
(Whimpering)

06:17.612 --> 06:19.111
I-I didn't do anything.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.880
I have no idea where
this is coming from.

06:20.882 --> 06:23.282
I swear, no matter what
Dar Adal said, I did not...

06:23.284 --> 06:25.351
Not him.

06:25.353 --> 06:26.819
Saul.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.854
Saul put your
name on the list.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.790
Saul?

06:30.792 --> 06:33.259
Close your eyes.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.228
I don't believe it.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.197
Believe it.

06:38.199 --> 06:40.399
Now play fucking dead.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.036
All right.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.939
(Beeping, click)

06:59.954 --> 07:02.855
Hurry up.
We got shit to do.

07:02.857 --> 07:05.291
What exactly?

07:09.063 --> 07:11.030
Your fallback plan--
time to execute it.

07:11.032 --> 07:13.198
What if I
don't have one?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.900
(Laughs)

07:14.902 --> 07:16.568
Could be true.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.537
Cut the crap, Carrie.
It's time to disappear and fast.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.439
This picture buys you time.

07:20.441 --> 07:23.709
As long as you keep your head
down, they won't come after you.

07:23.711 --> 07:27.880
So, your operation with Saul--
how does it work?

07:27.882 --> 07:30.349
Doesn't matter.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.788
Tell me.

07:35.790 --> 07:38.424
Saul provides a name,
I provide proof of death,

07:38.426 --> 07:41.060
return to the drop,
get another name.

07:41.062 --> 07:44.563
And the last time you went
to the drop, you got my name?

07:44.565 --> 07:45.965
Told you that already.

07:45.967 --> 07:47.967
Why?

07:47.969 --> 07:51.236
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.238
But I didn't do anything!

07:53.240 --> 07:55.975
Listen to me, Carrie.
Your name was in the box, okay?

07:55.977 --> 07:57.977
Probably for something
you're not even aware of.

07:57.979 --> 07:59.845
Now, I know that's hard to hear.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.950
I have to talk to Saul.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.286
For all you know,
he was given a direct order.

08:07.288 --> 08:08.854
What's your point?

08:08.856 --> 08:11.857
Somebody, somewhere, likely
very senior, wants you dead.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.659
If they think
you're not dead,

08:13.661 --> 08:16.762
they're gonna send somebody
to finish the job.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.497
You got to disappear.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.104
Etai: You assured me
that there was no plot

08:25.106 --> 08:27.339
to overthrow Bashar Al-Assad.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.208
- There isn't.
- Saul.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.210
You honor me with your presence

08:31.212 --> 08:34.480
at my Seder table,
so, I'll play along.

08:34.482 --> 08:35.881
(Chuckles)

08:35.883 --> 08:38.616
If you had a plan
to replace Assad,

08:38.619 --> 08:42.054
we understand that it would be
with General Youssef.

08:42.056 --> 08:44.056
Saul: Youssef would
be a good choice.

08:44.058 --> 08:45.691
If we had a plan like that.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.694
He's Alawite,
Assad's cousin by marriage.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.863
He's popular with the military.

08:50.865 --> 08:52.331
Well, some say he was behind

08:52.333 --> 08:54.166
the chemical weapons attack
in Khan Al-Asal.

08:54.168 --> 08:56.168
Those allegations
have never been confirmed.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.203
Let's play another game.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.973
What's the alternative?

09:00.975 --> 09:03.642
Leave Assad in place?

09:03.644 --> 09:05.878
When Arabs are killing Arabs,

09:05.880 --> 09:07.980
at least they're not
firing rockets at Israel.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.015
That's hardly
a long-term strategy

09:10.017 --> 09:12.217
for peace
in the Middle East.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.987
You really think any
of those murderers want peace?

09:17.058 --> 09:21.427
You used to be
a good friend to Israel.

09:21.429 --> 09:23.762
I'm still a good friend.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.165
You used to be a better one.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.637
Allison:
Etai?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.940
I've enjoyed
this evening so much.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.209
Well, I'm glad you
could share it with us.

09:37.211 --> 09:39.411
- So, dessert.
- Mm.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.047
We need to leave
in 15 minutes.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.216
Is everything
all right?

09:44.218 --> 09:46.085
It will be.

09:46.087 --> 09:47.920
(Line ringing)

09:47.922 --> 09:49.721
Hi. This is Carrie Mathison.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.091
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

09:52.093 --> 09:54.293
(Sighs)

09:54.295 --> 09:56.795
You're back.

09:57.932 --> 09:59.765
Ah, catching up.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.134
And Carrie?

10:02.136 --> 10:05.104
Still trying to figure out who
was responsible for the attack.

10:05.106 --> 10:06.872
I was helping her, but...

10:06.874 --> 10:08.307
we decided I was
needed here.

10:08.309 --> 10:09.808
Otto should fire her ass.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.244
- She saved his life.
- She didn't do her job.

10:12.246 --> 10:14.213
Which was to make sure he was
safe in the first place.

10:14.215 --> 10:16.215
She advised him not to go.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.786
Do you need something?

10:20.788 --> 10:23.922
My source for the documents
screwed me.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.757
He gave me an empty flash drive.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.593
- Why?
- I don't know why.

10:27.595 --> 10:28.994
Maybe he's afraid.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.562
The CIA is still following me.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.764
Okay, what can I do?

10:32.766 --> 10:36.135
You had a client, that hacker,
Sabine something.

10:36.137 --> 10:39.104
She won't help you, and as her
lawyer, I'd advise her not to.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.973
Jonas, she's famous.

10:40.975 --> 10:43.175
If she reaches out to my guy,
he'll respond.

10:43.177 --> 10:44.810
She's under
house arrest

10:44.812 --> 10:46.612
for three years. The government
really went after her.

10:46.614 --> 10:48.013
Give her a break, Laura.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.448
- A break?
- Yeah.

10:49.450 --> 10:51.650
The government's
after all of us!

10:51.652 --> 10:53.152
Everything all right?

10:53.154 --> 10:55.254
Fine.

10:55.256 --> 10:57.489
I'm asking Jonas to help me
track down my source

10:57.491 --> 11:00.192
so we can get a look
at the rest of those documents.

11:00.194 --> 11:02.528
Of course, help her.
It's important.

11:02.530 --> 11:04.329
What's the problem?

11:04.331 --> 11:07.299
No problem.
I'll make the call.

11:07.301 --> 11:09.468
Sooner the better.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.237
(Phone ringing)

11:13.374 --> 11:15.774
Hello?

11:16.944 --> 11:19.378
Anything?

11:20.548 --> 11:23.148
No. I drove up
to the cottage.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.150
She wasn't there.
Everything gone, no trace.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.552
We should call
the police.

11:26.554 --> 11:28.187
Of course we should,
but we can't.

11:28.189 --> 11:30.222
She said it would put
her in more danger.

11:30.224 --> 11:33.225
She has to figure it out on
her own to get to the truth.

11:33.227 --> 11:34.693
(Sighs)

11:34.695 --> 11:37.196
I mean, who lives like this?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.967
She does.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.504
I know you're worried.

11:45.506 --> 11:47.973
So am I.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.516
Quinn:
Ready?

11:57.518 --> 11:58.951
(Beep)

12:02.856 --> 12:05.257
Franny.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.860
You're named
after your grandfather,

12:08.862 --> 12:10.529
Frank Mathison.

12:10.531 --> 12:12.998
Did you know that?

12:14.668 --> 12:17.369
We haven't seen each other
for a while.

12:17.371 --> 12:19.571
I had to leave you,

12:19.573 --> 12:23.508
and you're probably
really angry about that.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.944
And I don't blame you.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.781
But, honey, something happened,

12:29.783 --> 12:34.186
and it wasn't safe for me
to be with you.

12:34.188 --> 12:37.189
But I am doing everything
that I can to get...

12:37.191 --> 12:38.757
What are you doing?

12:38.759 --> 12:41.260
- (Beep)
- If you're doing everything you can

12:41.262 --> 12:43.695
to get back to her,
then you're still alive.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.764
- So?
- So, if this falls

12:45.766 --> 12:48.133
into the wrong hands,
you're fucked.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.102
I'm not going away forever.

12:50.104 --> 12:52.771
Just until
this situation is resolved.

12:52.773 --> 12:57.309
- How is it getting resolved?
- I'm gonna figure out who targeted me...

12:57.311 --> 12:59.411
- Then they'll keep come looking for you.
- And I will fix it!

12:59.413 --> 13:00.812
And if they think
you're still alive,

13:00.814 --> 13:02.381
they will get to you
through Franny.

13:02.383 --> 13:04.383
- But...
- Carrie!

13:04.385 --> 13:09.721
If you want Franny to be
safe, you have to be dead.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.131
Jesus.

13:25.239 --> 13:28.573
How did you feel
when you had to leave your kid?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.876
Not everyone's fit
to be a parent.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.113
Let's do this.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.549
(Beep)

13:53.667 --> 13:56.435
Franny.

13:56.437 --> 13:58.837
maybe now...

13:58.839 --> 14:01.340
you're using Frances.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.245
We haven't seen each other
in a long time.

14:08.816 --> 14:11.216
I had to leave you, and...

14:11.218 --> 14:13.952
you probably hate me for it.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.321
And I don't blame you.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.491
But something happened, and...

14:19.493 --> 14:22.561
it wasn't safe
for me to be with you.

14:22.563 --> 14:24.363
I'm doing ev...

14:24.365 --> 14:26.465
(Sighing):
Shit.

14:32.573 --> 14:36.308
I <i> did</i> everything that I could

14:36.310 --> 14:38.810
to get back to you.

14:38.812 --> 14:42.314
But I-I didn't make it.

14:42.316 --> 14:46.651
The kind of work
that I did...

14:46.653 --> 14:49.488
it's dangerous.

14:49.490 --> 14:54.593
But I believed in it, so I was
willing to take that risk.

14:54.595 --> 14:56.395
But...

14:56.397 --> 14:59.398
But then you came along.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.734
(Voice breaking): And I realized
that I wanted something different.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.604
I wanted... a better life.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.643
And I had it with you
for a while.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.815
But...

15:24.591 --> 15:27.092
I didn't abandon you.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.430
I know what that feels like,

15:31.432 --> 15:34.166
and I would never
do that to you.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.769
You...

15:37.771 --> 15:40.739
are the most important, the...

15:40.741 --> 15:43.141
the best thing

15:43.143 --> 15:45.477
that I have ever done.

15:45.479 --> 15:47.913
You make up for every mistake

15:47.915 --> 15:49.815
that I've ever made.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.053
And although you probably
don't believe it...

16:01.728 --> 16:03.495
I love you...

16:03.497 --> 16:06.498
very, very much.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.055
(Doorbell buzzes)

16:38.165 --> 16:40.332
<i>Was?</i>

16:40.334 --> 16:42.334
I'm looking for Sabine.

16:42.336 --> 16:45.303
There's no Sabine here.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.472
I have a meeting with her.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.041
It was arranged through
her lawyer, Jonas Hollander.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.877
Is that so?

16:53.614 --> 16:57.048
I'm not leaving
until I see Sabine.

17:04.558 --> 17:06.858
Sabine's under
house arrest.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.294
But the BND keeps
sniffing around,

17:09.296 --> 17:11.695
trying to find something
to use against her.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.065
To send her to prison.

17:18.005 --> 17:20.672
Put your phone in here.
It blocks the signal.

17:20.674 --> 17:22.674
I already took out
the SIM card.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.742
Put your phone
in the bag or get out.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.422
She's looking for Sabine.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.560
Are you Sabine?

17:42.930 --> 17:44.996
What's going on?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.266
I'm Sabine.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.837
What was
that about?

17:52.839 --> 17:55.507
I have to be careful. Sorry.

17:55.509 --> 17:59.077
We know your work.
Amazing.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.779
(Speaks German)

18:00.781 --> 18:03.114
Sabine's not allowed
to communicate with journalists.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.116
It's a condition
of her house arrest.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.618
Sabine:
She's one of us.

18:06.620 --> 18:09.621
She exposed the
CIA and the BND.

18:09.623 --> 18:11.690
You kicked
their asses.

18:11.692 --> 18:13.191
There's more
where that came from.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.693
What do you mean?

18:14.695 --> 18:16.461
More documents.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.297
- No shit.
- The problem is,

18:19.299 --> 18:22.233
the guy who hacked the
documents-- I can't find him.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.703
Gabe H. Coud.

18:24.705 --> 18:28.039
- Who?
- Gabe H. Coud. What he calls himself online.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.408
- It's "douche bag" backwards.
- You know him?

18:30.410 --> 18:32.077
Of him. He's famous.

18:32.079 --> 18:33.578
Dude hacked the CIA.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.879
You can help me find him?

18:34.881 --> 18:37.248
I can find anyone.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.417
Woman: If you start
looking for Gabe H. Coud,

18:39.419 --> 18:41.720
you'll attract the attention
from the wrong people.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.223
This is like something
from the Stasi days.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.659
You guys are afraid
to <i> ask</i> for information?

18:47.661 --> 18:50.328
The BND would love
to throw my ass into prison.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.796
Let them try.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.999
I'll make their lives
a living hell.

18:54.001 --> 18:56.101
Sabine will be taking the risk,
not you.

18:56.103 --> 18:57.902
I'm facing arrest, too.
And extradition.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.305
I'm a person of interest.
Do you know what that means?

19:01.742 --> 19:04.109
It means you're not scared.

19:04.111 --> 19:06.878
It means I try not to be.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.914
_

19:33.774 --> 19:35.840
(Speaks Arabic)

19:44.217 --> 19:45.717
(Light German accent):
General Youssef?

19:45.719 --> 19:47.052
Yes?

19:47.054 --> 19:48.687
Mrs. Youssef?

19:48.689 --> 19:52.057
I'm Denise Keller,
Director of the Seeufer Clinic.

19:52.059 --> 19:54.492
The arrangements
were made

19:54.494 --> 19:56.494
through Dr. Droz.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.996
He's waiting
at the clinic.

19:57.998 --> 20:01.032
Hassan.
(Speaks Arabic)

20:01.034 --> 20:03.735
My wife would like to
travel with our daughter.

20:03.737 --> 20:05.236
Of course.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.072
Will you help Mrs. Youssef
into the ambulance?

20:07.074 --> 20:08.573
Certainly.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.642
Come with me, please.

20:11.887 --> 20:13.649
_

20:14.833 --> 20:16.562
_

20:21.054 --> 20:23.521
This way, please.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.690
Your family will have complete
privacy while you're here.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.192
There are no
other patients.

20:27.194 --> 20:28.993
The donor?

20:28.995 --> 20:31.963
He arrived safely and meets
all the medical requirements.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.034
You are not Swiss.
Your accent.

20:36.036 --> 20:38.069
You have a good ear.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.405
I'm from Berlin.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.145
Your daughter will be fine.
I promise.

20:59.126 --> 21:01.192
(Indistinct conversation)

21:05.899 --> 21:08.366
This is your surgeon,
Dr. Droz.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.069
Yes, uh, we've
spoken on the phone.

21:11.071 --> 21:13.271
Everything is in order.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.106
Good.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.175
For the kidney donor,
as well.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.046
I'll go prepare.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.151
Do you want
to spend a moment with Amena

21:26.153 --> 21:27.418
before they take her in?

21:27.420 --> 21:30.054
Yes, please.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.129
(Speaking Arabic)

21:57.584 --> 22:00.351
My assistant will show you
to the waiting lounge.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.187
If there's
anything you need,

22:02.189 --> 22:04.789
anything at all,
don't hesitate to ask.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.858
Thank you.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.983
So what do you make of him?

22:31.985 --> 22:33.651
What is he?

22:33.653 --> 22:36.521
Not a talker.
Proud.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.523
E-exactly what you'd expect.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.693
Used to giving orders
and having them obeyed, but

22:41.695 --> 22:43.528
his officers
seem to be in charge here.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.397
And he
resents that.

22:46.399 --> 22:50.001
Assad must believe
he's a flight risk.

22:50.003 --> 22:51.636
You think we have enough on him?

22:51.638 --> 22:53.204
The war crimes.

22:53.206 --> 22:55.006
His daughter's life
in the balance.

22:55.008 --> 22:57.141
The precarious state
of his country.

22:58.178 --> 23:00.311
We got a hand of aces.

23:00.313 --> 23:01.746
You think he'll burn?

23:01.748 --> 23:03.081
You know how it is, Saul.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.616
Some of these guys
get all patriotic.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.053
At least the intelligence
is correct--

23:09.055 --> 23:10.655
- he smokes.
- Good.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.557
I might have one with him.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.360
Offer him one of yours.
His are Syrian.

23:15.362 --> 23:17.862
- I think he'd appreciate an upgrade.
- (Chuckles)

23:17.864 --> 23:19.497
I will.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.901
I should get going.

23:23.904 --> 23:25.637
Yeah.

23:43.290 --> 23:45.023
Quinn:
You moved to Berlin.

23:45.025 --> 23:47.558
Got a new job, new guy.
And still kept

23:47.560 --> 23:49.294
your fallback
plan in place.

23:49.296 --> 23:51.262
So?

23:51.264 --> 23:54.532
So I guess you weren't sure your
new life was gonna work out.

23:57.871 --> 23:59.904
I found a good life here.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.973
I was happy.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.977
Where have you been?

24:05.979 --> 24:07.946
Syria.

24:10.317 --> 24:12.317
Quinn, the last two years,
everywhere I went,

24:12.319 --> 24:13.818
I looked for you.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.320
I tried
to find you.

24:15.322 --> 24:17.388
I never stopped
thinking about you.

24:19.326 --> 24:21.392
Doesn't matter now.

24:30.270 --> 24:31.803
Well...

24:33.907 --> 24:35.306
how do I look?

24:37.143 --> 24:39.510
Like somebody else.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.655
Did you ever see
Saul use the drop?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.623
- Carrie, come on.
- I need to know.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.460
Yeah, I saw him the
first time we set it up.

24:55.462 --> 24:57.028
Not since?

24:57.030 --> 24:58.629
I'm deniable. No
contact authorized.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.131
We have to move.

25:00.133 --> 25:01.632
So you don't know
for certain

25:01.634 --> 25:04.602
- it was Saul who put my name in the box.
- Christ.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.937
Do you or don't you?

25:05.939 --> 25:07.338
It's Saul's operation.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.107
That's all I
need to know.

25:09.109 --> 25:11.309
It doesn't make sense.
I mean, maybe Saul changed.

25:11.311 --> 25:14.445
Maybe I pissed him off.
But Saul's smart.

25:14.447 --> 25:16.280
Sending you to kill me
is not smart.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.648
It's fucking stupid.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.484
The fact that
I'm still alive proves it.

25:19.486 --> 25:21.719
You're still a target
either way you look at it.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.821
Quinn, if Saul didn't
put my name in the box,

25:23.823 --> 25:25.823
then someone's
inside your operation.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.559
Any name you get after this,
it's not legitimate.

25:28.561 --> 25:31.195
Let's test it.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.064
- Take me to your drop.
- No, I'll handle it.

25:33.066 --> 25:34.732
- I'll go with you.
- Get in the car.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.067
We're taking you
to the train.

25:36.069 --> 25:37.402
- No.
- Carrie.

25:37.404 --> 25:39.537
You are telling me
that someone I trust more

25:39.539 --> 25:42.006
than I've ever trusted
anyone is trying to kill me.

25:42.008 --> 25:45.009
And I'm just supposed to accept
that, no questions asked?

25:45.011 --> 25:48.079
Spend my life on the run,
give up my daughter?

25:49.749 --> 25:51.816
Quinn, I have to know.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.126
Right this way, General.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.865
Come in.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.568
There are some forms
you need to sign.

26:13.206 --> 26:15.239
There shouldn't be any forms.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.841
(American accent):
Please sit.

26:31.391 --> 26:33.758
What is happening here?

26:33.760 --> 26:35.526
I'm CIA.

26:35.528 --> 26:38.062
Everyone in this facility
is CIA.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.131
Except for the surgical
team, of course.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.069
You've traveled to Geneva
in violation

26:45.071 --> 26:46.571
of international sanctions.

26:46.573 --> 26:49.107
You have no rights here,
no immunity.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.442
We can arrest you and have
you transported to The Hague

26:51.444 --> 26:53.511
to stand trial
for war crimes.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.082
How dare you?

26:58.084 --> 27:00.284
Keep looking at the form.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.226
There is an alternative.

27:08.228 --> 27:10.895
Unfortunately, we don't have
time to discuss it now.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.497
Wait until lunch
is served.

27:12.499 --> 27:14.065
Say you want a smoke.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.400
Go for a walk in the garden.
Go alone.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.904
Now sign the form.

27:30.517 --> 27:32.917
Thank you,
General.

27:32.919 --> 27:35.853
You'll probably want to get back
to your wife now.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.612
(Sighs)

28:08.091 --> 28:09.695
_

28:11.029 --> 28:12.304
_

28:16.101 --> 28:17.929
_

28:24.396 --> 28:25.400
_

28:25.405 --> 28:27.138
Found him.
We're on.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.643
Ask him why he gave me
that bullshit empty drive.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.202
_

28:34.203 --> 28:36.516
_

28:38.525 --> 28:41.646
_

28:41.647 --> 28:42.688
_

28:42.689 --> 28:44.355
He says he gave you
the documents.

28:44.357 --> 28:46.891
The drive was empty.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.995
Empty?

28:53.066 --> 28:55.233
Fucking Korzenik.

28:55.235 --> 28:58.169
He says that his friend
must've screwed with the drive.

28:58.171 --> 28:59.837
Friend?

28:59.839 --> 29:01.439
How many people
know about this?

29:01.441 --> 29:03.441
Korzenik.

29:03.443 --> 29:06.010
You asshole.

29:06.012 --> 29:09.080
What did you do
to those documents?

29:10.883 --> 29:12.950
Call me back.

29:16.289 --> 29:18.356
(Indistinct conversations)

29:26.766 --> 29:28.266
Where's Korzenik?

29:28.268 --> 29:31.135
Go away. I'm working here.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.871
I need to talk
to your idiot boyfriend.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.573
He won't answer my calls.

29:35.575 --> 29:37.708
Get out.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.412
Hey.

29:41.414 --> 29:42.913
Call him.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.982
Call him.

29:46.786 --> 29:49.854
Call him and I'll leave.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.225
I'll be right back, baby.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.460
You piece of shit.

30:00.733 --> 30:03.134
Korzy?

30:03.136 --> 30:05.236
What...

30:05.238 --> 30:07.838
What did you do
with those documents?

30:07.840 --> 30:10.574
Relax. We're going to be rich.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.343
You sold them?

30:12.345 --> 30:13.811
You were going
to give them away.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.313
In the name of freedom.

30:15.315 --> 30:16.981
You know what gives you freedom?

30:16.983 --> 30:18.482
Money.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.351
My Russian friend paid big.

30:20.353 --> 30:22.119
Russians?

30:22.121 --> 30:24.355
They sent a car.

30:24.357 --> 30:26.490
Don't worry.
I'm going to cut you in.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.159
Even though
you don't deserve it.

30:28.161 --> 30:31.929
You don't know
what you are doing.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.364
I'm not stupid.

30:33.366 --> 30:37.034
You idiot.
Get out of the car.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.870
Korzy...

30:50.550 --> 30:52.616
<i>Kommen.</i>

31:05.698 --> 31:07.765
Â♪ Â♪

31:32.759 --> 31:34.759
Mr. Korzenik.

31:34.761 --> 31:36.894
Come in.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.497
Where's Boris?

31:39.499 --> 31:40.865
Boris is not here.

31:40.867 --> 31:42.833
You'll be dealing with me.
Please,

31:42.835 --> 31:45.436
sit down.

31:45.438 --> 31:47.905
This is my, uh,
colleague, Valentin.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.373
Valentin, say hello.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.176
Mm.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.979
Ivan.
Very nice to meet you.

31:56.883 --> 31:58.883
So,

31:58.885 --> 32:00.584
you have something
for me.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.888
I want my
money first.

32:03.890 --> 32:06.690
Of course.
Sorry.

32:13.399 --> 32:16.066
Okay?

32:16.068 --> 32:19.470
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:19.472 --> 32:23.474
Now I need something
from you.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.282
Excellent.

32:33.052 --> 32:36.153
We will check it.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.259
To business, Mr. Korzenik.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.662
To business.

32:46.599 --> 32:48.332
This is the only copy,
right?

32:48.334 --> 32:49.767
Of course.

32:49.769 --> 32:51.268
You sure?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.304
Not gonna trick me or something?

32:53.306 --> 32:56.073
It's the only copy.
I promise.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.641
Good.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.276
So, I go now.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.178
Sit.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.647
Please.

33:04.584 --> 33:06.917
You know...
(Clears throat)

33:06.919 --> 33:10.321
One of my ambitions in life
is to be a trusting person.

33:10.323 --> 33:13.757
I think it's an admirable
quality, you know, trust.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.293
People who are
the opposite,

33:16.295 --> 33:19.129
who are... what's the word
in English I mean?

33:19.131 --> 33:22.066
- Suspicious?
- Cynical.

33:23.703 --> 33:26.704
That's not a pleasant life.

33:26.706 --> 33:28.539
So, you see,

33:28.541 --> 33:31.509
I want to trust you,
Mr. Korzenik.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.514
Unfortunately,

33:36.516 --> 33:38.616
I am cynical.

33:43.523 --> 33:46.524
So peaceful.

33:46.526 --> 33:49.593
Don't you think?

33:54.133 --> 33:56.133
I'm going to smoke.

33:56.135 --> 33:57.968
Will you check on Amena?

33:57.970 --> 33:59.970
Of course.

33:59.972 --> 34:03.374
What, you don't trust
me to have a smoke?

34:03.376 --> 34:06.043
What do you
think I'll do?

34:06.045 --> 34:10.214
Swim across the lake while
my daughter is in surgery?

34:10.216 --> 34:13.050
Enjoy your lunch.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.989
(Birds chirping)

34:28.333 --> 34:29.900
General Youssef.

34:29.902 --> 34:33.504
Saul Berenson. I'm flattered.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.505
Please, have a seat.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.576
We don't have
much time.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.978
Care for one?

34:53.525 --> 34:57.194
General, you and I both
know the crisis in Syria

34:57.196 --> 34:58.929
is getting worse every day.

34:58.931 --> 35:01.932
You wish me to believe you
are concerned for my country?

35:01.934 --> 35:04.468
Our argument is
with your president,

35:04.470 --> 35:07.037
not with the Syrian people.

35:07.039 --> 35:09.974
The Islamic State is
preparing a major offensive

35:09.976 --> 35:11.609
against
the Regime.

35:11.611 --> 35:15.112
- So?
- They control half of all Syrian territory.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.614
Your regular
army's been reduced

35:16.616 --> 35:18.649
through casualties
and desertions.

35:18.651 --> 35:21.452
Tell me something I don't know.

35:24.390 --> 35:28.292
Let's talk
frankly, General.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.628
You will lose
the war.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.262
When Damascus falls,

35:32.264 --> 35:34.465
every Alawi in the country,

35:34.467 --> 35:36.667
including you and your family,

35:36.669 --> 35:38.469
will be slaughtered.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.407
I know you love
your country.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.776
You don't know anything
about me.

35:45.778 --> 35:48.112
I know you're an able commander.

35:48.114 --> 35:51.081
You have a loyal following
among the high-ranking officers.

35:51.083 --> 35:54.718
We believe they will support you
to lead your country.

35:56.856 --> 35:59.156
To lead my...

35:59.158 --> 36:01.825
When you replace Assad.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.665
(Chuckling)

36:09.602 --> 36:13.704
This is your solution for Syria?

36:14.974 --> 36:17.675
It's the best one on the table.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.549
Half of the government ministers
are Bashir's family.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.484
All loyal.
How do I deal with them?

36:27.486 --> 36:29.219
At this moment,

36:29.221 --> 36:31.655
we're loading $10
million onto your jet.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.625
That money will buy you
a great deal of influence.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.860
Bashir has money to bribe, too.

36:36.862 --> 36:40.864
But you,
as Syria's new president--

36:40.866 --> 36:43.867
promising free elections,
democratic reforms--

36:43.869 --> 36:46.804
you'll have the support
of the United States.

36:48.207 --> 36:52.009
This support,
it includes troops and weapons?

36:52.011 --> 36:53.711
We will do what it takes

36:53.713 --> 36:56.947
to unite the country
around your government.

36:57.917 --> 37:00.250
But we must
act quickly.

37:00.252 --> 37:03.921
Before your enemies
gain more strength.

37:03.923 --> 37:06.356
You are wrong.

37:06.358 --> 37:10.094
The world recognizes
the real danger in Syria,

37:10.096 --> 37:12.696
the so-called Islamic State.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.598
As they
get stronger,

37:14.600 --> 37:16.366
Bashir no longer looks so evil.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.701
The world will come around.

37:17.703 --> 37:20.938
They will support us
against Daesh.

37:22.174 --> 37:25.209
If Assad stays in power,

37:25.211 --> 37:27.745
he'll have to answer
for his crimes.

37:27.747 --> 37:29.413
What crimes?

37:29.415 --> 37:31.582
Barrel bombs.
Chemical weapons.

37:31.584 --> 37:33.016
Bullshit. Lies.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.619
We've seen the
bodies in Ghouta.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.688
Assad's already told the world
it was his commanders

37:37.690 --> 37:39.556
who fired the weapons.

37:39.558 --> 37:42.459
Think he'll hesitate to
hand you over to the ICC?

37:43.696 --> 37:46.296
He will not accuse me.

37:46.298 --> 37:49.066
I am not personally responsible
for any of that.

37:49.068 --> 37:51.401
Well, I believe you. I also
believe Assad has demonstrated

37:51.403 --> 37:54.538
he will do anything,
he will say anything

37:54.540 --> 37:56.707
to keep his grip on power.

38:02.114 --> 38:04.114
General, we're out of time.

38:05.217 --> 38:06.750
(Sighs)

38:06.752 --> 38:08.252
I know you're a patriot.

38:08.254 --> 38:11.789
Your people have suffered
so much already.

38:11.791 --> 38:14.558
Show them the way forward.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.461
Lead 'em into the light.

38:29.008 --> 38:31.508
(Sighs)

38:33.112 --> 38:35.579
(Katja crying)

38:48.527 --> 38:50.994
(Crying)

38:54.300 --> 38:56.767
(Speaking Russian)

38:58.771 --> 39:00.771
(Speaks Russian)

39:00.773 --> 39:02.172
They found it?

39:02.174 --> 39:03.440
Yes. We're good.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.842
Thank you.

39:04.844 --> 39:07.678
There is just
that one copy. I swear.

39:07.680 --> 39:11.381
I only kept it...
(Choking)

39:11.383 --> 39:13.784
(Indistinct chatter)

39:30.803 --> 39:32.369
Korzy?

39:33.339 --> 39:34.872
Korzy?

39:43.816 --> 39:45.883
(Speaks German)

40:07.539 --> 40:10.474
(Indistinct chatter)

40:18.884 --> 40:21.919
Quinn:
I go in, I drop it off,

40:21.921 --> 40:23.520
I get the next name on the list.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.355
Then we wait for someone
to pick it up?

40:25.357 --> 40:27.090
We wait for Saul
to pick it up.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.293
And when he shows
up, we leave.

40:29.295 --> 40:31.995
And you get as far away
from here as possible.

40:33.465 --> 40:34.531
Agreed?

40:35.534 --> 40:37.267
Agreed.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.971
Slide over.
We may have to move fast.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.567
(Key jangles)

41:41.367 --> 41:44.401
(Phone chimes)

41:44.858 --> 41:47.275
_

41:52.311 --> 41:54.544
(Starts engine)

42:04.356 --> 42:05.789
Oh.

42:05.791 --> 42:08.992
(Speaks German)

42:08.994 --> 42:11.028
(Sighs)

42:11.964 --> 42:15.465
(School bell ringing)

42:16.902 --> 42:19.369
(Indistinct chatter)

42:44.363 --> 42:45.729
(Tires screech)

42:48.934 --> 42:49.933
(Grunts)

42:49.935 --> 42:51.268
(Woman screams)

42:53.772 --> 42:56.807
- (Screaming, shouting)
- (Groans)

43:01.880 --> 43:03.146
(Screaming, shouting)

43:24.470 --> 43:26.303
I should take you
to a hospital.

43:26.305 --> 43:27.771
No, I'm okay.

43:27.773 --> 43:29.039
You are not okay.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.373
We should pull over.

43:30.375 --> 43:31.942
No. Be coming back to get him.

43:31.944 --> 43:34.211
Who was that?

43:34.213 --> 43:36.480
Whoever wants you dead
wants me dead.

43:36.482 --> 43:39.216
(Groans) We have to get
you to the train station.

43:39.218 --> 43:41.418
- No.
- Your photo's in the drop.

43:41.420 --> 43:44.955
- You'll have your cover. You can go.
- I am not leaving you.

43:44.957 --> 43:47.390
I'm not.

43:50.129 --> 43:52.329
(Panting)

43:52.331 --> 43:54.464
(Groans loudly)

43:54.466 --> 43:56.566
(Groans)

43:56.568 --> 43:58.935
Check the back.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.937
(Groaning)

44:00.939 --> 44:02.405
There's
an exit wound.

44:02.407 --> 44:03.640
Good. It went through.

44:03.642 --> 44:04.808
Could've hit an artery.

44:04.810 --> 44:05.809
I'd have bled out by now.

44:05.811 --> 44:06.810
We need to get

44:06.812 --> 44:08.345
some morphine into you.

44:08.347 --> 44:10.013
There's a medical kit
on the bench.

44:10.015 --> 44:12.015
Okay.

44:12.017 --> 44:14.484
(Groaning)

44:17.623 --> 44:20.090
(Panting)

44:24.296 --> 44:27.097
(Pants, whimpers)

44:27.099 --> 44:28.832
Quinn, you with me?

44:30.536 --> 44:31.968
All right.

44:31.970 --> 44:34.638
(Panting)

44:34.640 --> 44:36.640
Turn over.

44:36.642 --> 44:39.709
All right,
I'm gonna muscle it.

44:39.711 --> 44:42.345
(Groans)

44:42.347 --> 44:44.981
We need to put some
pressure on these wounds.

44:44.983 --> 44:46.816
(Groans loudly)

44:46.818 --> 44:49.186
All right.
Hold on. Sit up.

44:49.188 --> 44:51.188
(Groans)

44:51.190 --> 44:53.690
(Panting)

44:58.564 --> 45:00.197
(Groans)

45:00.199 --> 45:02.365
Hang on, Quinn.

45:07.806 --> 45:10.207
(Indistinct chatter)

45:19.218 --> 45:21.952
My colleague asked me
to give you these.

45:23.088 --> 45:24.721
I have a request.

45:24.723 --> 45:26.323
What is it?

45:26.325 --> 45:29.326
I'd like my wife and
daughter to remain behind.

45:29.328 --> 45:31.828
To live in Europe
until the conflict

45:31.830 --> 45:33.730
in my country
is resolved.

45:35.100 --> 45:38.101
I admire your concern
for your family.

45:38.103 --> 45:39.703
But I can't
allow it.

45:39.705 --> 45:42.539
Returning to Syria without them
would raise a red flag.

45:42.541 --> 45:45.008
How do you know I'll do this?

45:45.010 --> 45:46.776
I have your money.

45:46.778 --> 45:49.779
When I get home,
I could just do nothing.

45:49.781 --> 45:53.116
Yes. You could.

45:53.118 --> 45:56.253
But we're betting
you're smarter than that.

46:18.377 --> 46:21.711
He asked if his family
could stay behind.

46:21.713 --> 46:24.281
That's a good sign.

46:24.283 --> 46:25.548
Yeah?

46:25.550 --> 46:27.417
Yeah.

46:27.419 --> 46:29.552
It means he knows
he's fucked.

46:31.256 --> 46:33.957
It means
he might just cooperate.

47:00.252 --> 47:02.252
There's only one number
in the memory.

47:02.254 --> 47:03.720
Call it.

47:09.594 --> 47:10.894
(Beep)

47:16.301 --> 47:18.768
(Phone ringing)

47:24.109 --> 47:28.178
(Speaking Russian)

47:38.657 --> 47:41.291
(Explosion booms)

47:43.829 --> 47:46.196
Oh, my God.
