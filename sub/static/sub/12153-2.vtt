<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Previously on Angel.</i>

00:06.800 --> 00:09.200
Who are you?

00:09.200 --> 00:11.900
<i>[Woman] This is to confirm</i>
<i>that you have been rescued by Angel...</i>

00:11.900 --> 00:14.100
C.E.O. And president
of Wolfram and Hart.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.600
- You run a law firm?
- Well, just lately.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.400
- Why on earth are we here?
- What, because we're crusaders against evil...

00:19.400 --> 00:22.500
and now the law firm that represents
most of the evil in the world...

00:22.500 --> 00:24.900
has given us its L.A. Branch
to run however we want?

00:24.900 --> 00:26.400
We're turnin'
this place inside out.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.000
Yes, it's perfect. It's the project
you've been waiting for.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.900
Yeah, it's <i>Joanie Loves Chachi</i> meets
<i>The Sorrow And The Pity.</i>

00:31.900 --> 00:34.400
- Harmony.
- Hey, boss.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.800
- You're my secretary?
<i>- [Fred] Have you seen my lab?</i>

00:36.800 --> 00:38.800
<i>It's giganamous.</i>
<i>And I'm in charge.</i>

00:38.800 --> 00:41.100
I'm just wondering
if you're ready for the next step.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.000
You don't know me,
or you wouldn't ask that question.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.300
<i>[Eve] Charles agreed to let us</i>
<i>enhance his mind...</i>

00:47.300 --> 00:48.900
with a comprehensive
knowledge of the law.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.800
We're gonna change things.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.800
We came to Wolfram and Hart
because it's a powerful weapon.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.600
<i>We'll deal with</i>
<i>whatever comes next.</i>

01:02.000 --> 01:05.200
[Screaming]

01:05.200 --> 01:09.900
Spike.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.600
- Go on, then.
- No, you've done enough. You could still...

01:30.600 --> 01:33.400
No. You've beaten 'em back.
It's for me to do the cleanup.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.900
- Spike.
- I mean it. I gotta do this.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.300
Now, go.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.200
I want to see how it ends.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.800
[Laughing]

02:07.200 --> 02:09.600
[Gasps]

02:14.700 --> 02:16.800
What? What?

02:16.800 --> 02:19.300
What the hell are
you doing here, Spike?

02:19.300 --> 02:21.000
- Harmony, please.
<i>- [Gunn] This is Spike?</i>

02:21.000 --> 02:22.700
<i>- The</i> Spike?
- Wait a minute, who's...

02:22.700 --> 02:25.000
<i>Easy, slim, easy.</i>
<i>No one's gonna hurt you.</i>

02:25.000 --> 02:26.600
Speak for yourself,
Green Jeans.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.800
- Would somebody please tell me...
- William the Bloody, a vampire.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.600
One of the worst recorded.
Second only to...

02:32.600 --> 02:34.100
Me.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.300
But you're dead.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.600
<i>Well, yeah.</i>
<i>Who here isn't?</i>

02:43.600 --> 02:46.400
Besides him and him
and her and...

02:47.500 --> 02:49.700
What are you again?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.500
Bugger.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.500
What... What's
happened to me?

04:06.900 --> 04:10.700
<i>Well, I'm no doctor,</i>
<i>but I think you're a ghost.</i>

04:11.000 --> 04:13.600
I'm no...
I'm no bloody ghost.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.000
Hey, you're the one
sticking out of a desk, pal.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.600
<i>And you can't talk to me like that.</i>
<i>We're not going out anymore.</i>

04:19.600 --> 04:21.700
Where'd
he come from?

04:21.700 --> 04:24.700
- From this.
<i>- [Fred] What is it?</i>

04:24.700 --> 04:28.500
- Somethin' I gave to Buffy before...
- Buffy? Is she...

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
She's okay.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.400
Where?
Where is she?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.300
Europe,
last I heard from her.

04:36.300 --> 04:39.200
I want to see her,
talk to her.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.800
That's gonna be tough.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.700
- You can't keep her from me.
- She's not mine to keep or yours.

04:45.900 --> 04:49.100
Says you? You got
no idea what we had.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.800
- You never had her.
- More than you, you poncey...

04:51.800 --> 04:54.600
<i>Oh, my God.!</i>

04:54.600 --> 04:57.100
You and
the Slayer actually...

04:57.100 --> 05:00.300
<i>I mean, I know you had</i>
<i>that twisted obsession with her, but...</i>

05:00.300 --> 05:04.200
Ugh!
That's just... Ugh!

05:04.500 --> 05:06.400
L...

05:07.300 --> 05:08.600
Ugh!

05:09.800 --> 05:11.900
I must be in hell.

05:11.900 --> 05:15.400
<i>Uh, no, L.A. But a lot of people</i>
<i>make that mistake.</i>

05:15.400 --> 05:18.100
So Spike and Buffy...

05:18.100 --> 05:22.100
He was, um, an ally
of hers for some time.

05:22.100 --> 05:26.000
At least that's what Angel told me.
That's all Angel told me.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.200
So he's a good guy
vampire like Angel?

05:28.200 --> 05:29.900
He's nothing like me.

05:29.900 --> 05:33.700
Got that right.
What have you done to me?

05:33.700 --> 05:36.300
What is this place?

05:36.300 --> 05:38.500
Who are you people?

05:38.500 --> 05:41.600
What the bloody hell
is happening?

05:48.700 --> 05:50.900
- Honey of a story.
- Story?

05:50.900 --> 05:54.800
Yeah. The Vampire Slayer
both men loved, both men lost.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.800
Oh, I could sell that
to any studio in a heartbeat.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.200
L... I see
Depp and Bloom.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.600
But then, I see them a lot.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.000
Sorry. Hazard of running
the Entertainment Division.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.800
Gotta get out more.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.500
So what are you, then?
Scanner girl?

06:11.500 --> 06:15.500
I'm Fred. I head up
Wolfram and Hart's Science Department.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.900
Wolfram and Hart? Heard of that.
Thought it was a law firm.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.200
It is, among other things.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.800
Also heard they represent
the worst evil in the universe.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.800
It did, among other things.
But now I'm in charge.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.100
- Are you, now?
<i>- [Fred] Weird.</i>

06:30.100 --> 06:33.900
I'm getting electromagnetic readings
consistent with spiritual entities...

06:33.900 --> 06:35.800
but there's no
ectoplasmic matrix.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.700
- Meaning?
- Ectoplasm is what makes
ghosts visible to the human eye.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.100
If he's a ghost, technically
we shouldn't be able to see him.

06:43.100 --> 06:46.000
And I'm detecting
brain wave activity.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.100
On Spike? Huh.
That is weird.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.900
Also, ghosts generally
absorb light and heat energy...

06:51.900 --> 06:54.800
making the area around them
a few degrees cooler.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.700
Spike's radiating heat.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.800
Think I'm hot,
do you?

06:58.800 --> 07:02.800
Hmm. Lukewarm. Just above
room temperature.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.900
Well, what the hell
am I then?

07:04.900 --> 07:06.900
Whatever he is,
it's clearly tied to this amulet.

07:06.900 --> 07:10.400
<i>Spike's essence,</i>
<i>for lack of a better term...</i>

07:10.400 --> 07:12.400
must've been
held within it.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.900
<i>Do you have any memory</i>
<i>of a strange sensation...</i>

07:14.900 --> 07:16.900
when it released
its energy?

07:16.900 --> 07:19.400
What, you mean my skin and muscle
burning away from the bone?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.200
<i>Organs exploding</i>
<i>in my chest?</i>

07:21.200 --> 07:24.200
Eyeballs melting in their sockets?
No. No memory at all. Thanks for asking.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.200
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Okay, he's connected to the amulet.</i>

07:26.200 --> 07:30.500
Last I heard, it was buried deep inside
of the Hellmouth. How did it end up here?

07:30.500 --> 07:35.600
Maybe he's here for a reason. You know, some
higher purpose or something he's destined for...

07:35.600 --> 07:38.000
sent to us by the Powers
That Be to help us or...

07:38.000 --> 07:40.700
Who gave them
the bloody right to do that?

07:40.700 --> 07:42.500
[Scoffs]

07:42.500 --> 07:47.800
Can't a man die in peace without some
high almighty deciding it's not his time?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.700
Let's have a little
more fun with him, eh?

07:49.700 --> 07:53.700
<i>You'd think that saving the soddin'world</i>
<i>would be enough to earn me a rest.</i>

07:53.700 --> 07:55.700
- You'd think.
- Spike...

07:56.900 --> 08:00.400
Hmm?
Oh, balls.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.500
- Now what?
- I don't know. He just...

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
What did he mean,
saving the world?

08:11.500 --> 08:14.100
Oh, that?
Well...

08:14.100 --> 08:16.700
[Scoffs] Buffy did most
of the work.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.900
Well, he helped, but...

08:18.900 --> 08:22.800
Hmm?
What? What?

08:22.800 --> 08:25.400
- Took the whats right out of our mouths.
- Where'd you go?

08:27.000 --> 08:31.300
- Don't you know?
- I'm... I was...

08:32.700 --> 08:35.900
You. This is your fault.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.900
- Mine?
- You brought that bloody amulet to Sunnydale.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.700
<i>You would have been the one to use it,</i>
<i>until you chickened out.</i>

08:41.700 --> 08:43.600
- What did you...
- You heard me.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.400
<i>You left town in the nick of time,</i>
<i>before the death and mayhem.</i>

08:46.400 --> 08:48.600
Abandoned the woman
you claimed to love.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.400
She made the call.
It wasn't my choice.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.400
And this bloody hell
wasn't mine.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.800
<i>I'm not you. I don't give a piss</i>
<i>about atonement or destiny.</i>

08:56.800 --> 09:00.500
Just because I've got me a soul doesn't mean
I'm gonna let myself be led around...

09:00.500 --> 09:03.700
- Excuse me?
- Did... Did you just say...

09:04.800 --> 09:07.800
Spike has a soul?
You never said.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.100
- Didn't seem worth mentioning.
- Seems to be a lot of that.

09:11.100 --> 09:16.300
Or maybe Captain Forehead
was feeling a little less special.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.300
<i>Didn't like me crashing</i>
<i>his exclusive club.</i>

09:19.300 --> 09:21.600
Another vampire
with a soul in the world.

09:22.600 --> 09:26.500
You're not <i>in</i> the world, Casper.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.600
Runnin' away again?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.500
Nice new M.O.
I can see why heroes like you...

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
get rewarded with
the shiny new glass and chrome.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.600
- Why didn't I think of that?
- I'm not responsible for what happened to you.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.500
Angel, it's almost 3:00.
You have a meeting...

09:53.500 --> 09:56.500
- Not now, Harmony.
- And here, you've even managed
to get my ex-tumble...

09:56.500 --> 09:58.500
the littlest vampire,
fetching coffee for you.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.400
- Nice perks for the sellout.
- A little tip, Spike.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.500
Try not to talk about
things you don't understand.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.200
I'm not the prat here.
I know you, Angel.

10:05.200 --> 10:09.500
What do you think you're doing? You made
some devil's bargain to take over this company.

10:09.500 --> 10:13.000
Thought you'd use it to fight the evil of
the world from inside the belly of the beast.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.900
Trouble is, you're too busy fighting to see
you and yours are getting digested.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.200
- Not gonna happen.
- What, you think you're in control here?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.300
Guess again, mate.
You're no more in control than I am.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.400
Except I'm not gonna bloody stand for it,
while you're just a blind...

10:24.400 --> 10:27.200
- Grox'lar beast.
- What?

10:30.800 --> 10:33.700
[Growls]

10:38.300 --> 10:40.300
Oh, brilliant.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.700
[Bones Cracking]

10:58.600 --> 11:01.900
[Exhales] Okay. Somebody wanna
tell me how a Grox'lar beast...

11:01.900 --> 11:03.900
got past Security?

11:03.900 --> 11:06.400
- I don't have time for this.
<i>- [Spike] Of course not.</i>

11:06.400 --> 11:09.600
Man's gotta stay focused on
profit margins and power lunches.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.600
- Angel...
- Yeah, Spike, I've got a business to run.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.900
That means responsibilities,
appointments to keep...

11:13.900 --> 11:15.900
- That was your 3:00.
- That...

11:21.700 --> 11:24.000
I'm meeting
with Grox'lars?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.900
They eat babies.

11:25.900 --> 11:29.400
Just their heads. You were supposed
to open negotiations with his clan.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.400
- Negotiations for what?
- Get 'em to stop eating baby heads.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.500
Oh, so that's good.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.400
Oh, so this...
this is bad.

11:39.400 --> 11:43.300
No, actually the Grox'lar clan respects someone
who takes a strong opening position.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.200
Wolfram and Hart didn't just jack me
up here with the human laws.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200
Also demon laws
from every dimension.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.400
<i>Probably should've briefed</i>
<i>you about the Grox'lar...</i>

11:50.400 --> 11:53.000
but we got a little
sidetracked.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.600
Plus, I've been implementing our
reforms, mostly staff overhaul.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.900
I fired 40 employees
in the past two days.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.600
- How's that goin'?
- As expected.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.300
Anger, tears,
venomous death threats.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.700
<i>Listen, I know I was</i>
<i>a little crabby before.</i>

12:07.700 --> 12:10.900
I mean, hello.
A little awkward seeing you at my work.

12:10.900 --> 12:15.600
But if... if you want to talk or something,
you know, about us or...

12:17.900 --> 12:20.500
Okay, too soon.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.600
I understand.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.800
Slayer-loving freak.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.200
Caught an associate
we laid off...

12:27.200 --> 12:29.800
tryin' to smuggle this
out of the Voodoo Division.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.100
It's a nice likeness.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.600
<i>This placejust</i>
<i>goes on and on, doesn't it?</i>

12:36.600 --> 12:38.500
Like a ruddy
theme park attraction.

12:38.500 --> 12:42.300
- I'm in a meeting, Spike.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't care.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.600
<i>We're rufflin'a lot of</i>
<i>dangerous feathers out there.</i>

12:44.600 --> 12:46.500
There's gonna be a backlash.
Count on it.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.800
We'll just have to ride out
the ripples for a while.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.400
I'm sensin' a ripple
on its way now.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.800
Yes, uh...

12:52.800 --> 12:54.900
Novac, sir. Uh,
what's this about you...

12:54.900 --> 12:57.200
shutting down
the Internment Acquisitions Division?

12:58.300 --> 13:00.100
- Internment Acqui...
- Grave-robbing.

13:00.100 --> 13:03.800
<i>Listen, I know you fellows are in charge now,</i>
<i>and you're doin'a bang-upjob.</i>

13:03.800 --> 13:05.600
<i>I'm with you 110%.</i>

13:05.600 --> 13:08.200
But that department brings in
<i>mucho</i> revenue to this company.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.300
Well, Novac, we'll just have to
tighten our belts and do without.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.900
No, you're not getting it.

13:13.900 --> 13:16.300
Sir.

13:16.300 --> 13:21.000
I.A.D. Is under contract to provide
fresh bodies to Magnus Hainsley.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.900
You know
who he is, right?

13:25.900 --> 13:29.000
Oy. Okay. He's one
of our oldest clients.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.300
Big potatoes.
We stop delivering...

13:31.300 --> 13:34.800
and he is not going
to be... thrilled.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.600
Then he's probably not gonna like it when
you advise him that he's no longer our client.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.700
- Me?
- You got it, counselor.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.100
- You tell Mr <i>...</i> [Clear Throat]
- Hainsley.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.900
Hainsley that
Wolfram and Hart...

13:46.900 --> 13:50.100
is under new management and out of
the grave-robbing business.

13:50.100 --> 13:53.300
Now, run along
and go argue your case.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.500
- Me?
- Go.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.000
You don't have to
take that from him, mate.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Stay out of this, Spike.
You don't work here.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.900
Damn right I don't.
Look at you.

14:06.900 --> 14:10.700
<i>This is what you do now? Delegate</i>
<i>the dirty work to spineless, low-level flunkies?</i>

14:10.700 --> 14:12.700
No offense.

14:12.700 --> 14:17.100
<i>The mighty hero, reduced to</i>
<i>a bloody bureaucrat.</i>

14:17.100 --> 14:19.100
If a certain Slayer
could see you now...

14:19.100 --> 14:21.500
Get outta here, Spike.

14:21.500 --> 14:25.300
Gladly. Cruel enough punishment
being stuck here as a spook...

14:25.300 --> 14:28.100
while you play
chairman of the boring.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.400
But hell if I'm going to spend
my afterlife in your stinking city.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.400
Get stuffed.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.600
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>he's really gone, do you?</i>

14:54.600 --> 14:57.700
That what's
on your mind?

14:57.700 --> 14:59.600
Could've been me, Wes.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.600
It was supposed to be me.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.300
- You're not feeling guilty.
- What, about Spike?

15:04.300 --> 15:06.300
[Chuckles]
That's... That's not...

15:09.200 --> 15:12.900
Wolfram and Hart
gave me the amulet.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.300
They must have
expected me to use it...

15:15.300 --> 15:18.600
and they had to have known it would have
done to me what it did to Spike, so...

15:18.600 --> 15:21.100
<i>Why bother handing you</i>
<i>the keys to the kingdom?</i>

15:21.100 --> 15:24.600
<i>It doesn't make sense. What are</i>
<i>the senior partners playing at?</i>

15:24.600 --> 15:26.800
Maybe there's dissent
in their ranks. Or maybe...

15:26.800 --> 15:30.100
there's another player in the game
they and we don't know anything about.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.200
Then again, maybe they got exactly
what they were after.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.100
- Spike.
- He may be the one they...

15:38.100 --> 15:40.700
What are you doin' here?
I thought you left town.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.800
Don't think
I didn't bleeding try.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.500
Every time I got as far as the city limits,
I kept popping back here.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.100
Like my insides
were getting yanked.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.200
<i>I suspected as much. The amulet's</i>
<i>Wolfram and Hart's property.</i>

15:52.200 --> 15:54.900
It's bound to this place.
And since Spike's connected to it...

15:54.900 --> 15:57.800
Hey, I'm nobody's
bloody property, Percy.

15:57.800 --> 16:02.700
<i>So what, I'm just stuck here forever?</i>
<i>I bet you're loving this, aren't you?</i>

16:02.700 --> 16:05.000
Knowing you'll be haunting me
till the end of time.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.100
Mm, it's a dream come true.

16:07.100 --> 16:11.500
<i>[Harmony] Uh, boss? That Novac lawyer</i>
<i>you sent over to dump the client...</i>

16:11.500 --> 16:13.400
Well, he's back.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.600
- Okay, send him in.
- Okay.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.000

16:33.600 --> 16:35.900
Hmm. OI' buckets here was right.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.700
You guys are doin'
a bang-up job.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.100
Harmony, get me
Novac's contact list.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.300
Close relations,
next of kin.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.100
And let's be discreet about this
for the time being, okay?

16:53.100 --> 16:58.200
Discreet? Oh, you mean like not tell anyone
about bucket o' lawyer.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.000
- Harmony, contact list.
- Hey.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.900
Got word you wanted the file
on Magnus Hainsley.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.800
Dig this.
He's a sorcerer, big-time.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.700
Rich with old money
and older mojo.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.900
Owns a respectable block of shares
in Wolfram and Hart...

17:07.900 --> 17:09.900
and he's connected
up the wazoo.

17:09.900 --> 17:13.099
Carries influence with power players
in the entertainment industry, politics...

17:13.099 --> 17:15.200
- Oh, he's a necromancer.
- Power over the dead.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.099
That explains the bodies
Wolfram and Hart's been providing him.

17:18.099 --> 17:21.099
But not what he's been doing with them.
Out of my chair.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.500
- Make me.
- What's in the buckets?

17:25.500 --> 17:29.200
Your man Novac. Guess he's been...
what do you call it... downsized.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.200
It's a message
from Magnus Hainsley.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.400
And I'm gonna
reply to it personally.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.300
- You can't take Hainsley on.
- I'm not gonna risk him
turning somebody else into chowder.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.900
<i>Angel, you've got a multibillion-dollar</i>
<i>company at your disposal...</i>

17:40.900 --> 17:42.900
<i>with armed</i>
<i>and trained personnel.</i>

17:42.900 --> 17:46.700
- They cramp my style.
<i>- Your style's not going to cut it</i>
<i>with a necromancer.</i>

17:47.000 --> 17:50.800
We should probably avoid
an eye-for-an-eye escalation here.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.500
- I'm not goin' for his eyes, Wes.
- I know what you should go for.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.500
It'll hurt him. Bad.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.300
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Knew you'd pick the Viper.</i>

18:15.300 --> 18:18.800
- So bloody predictable.
- Spike, get out of the car.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.400
- No.
- What?

18:21.400 --> 18:24.900
This "haunting you until the end of time" idea
of yours is starting to sound appealing.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.200
<i>I could drive you</i>
<i>completely starkers.</i>

18:27.200 --> 18:31.200
Right out of your gourd. Yeah, and you wouldn't
be able to do a soddin' thing about it.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.300
Fancy a road trip?

18:45.300 --> 18:49.200
This'll be fun, eh?
You and me together again.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.900
So, where are we off to?

18:51.900 --> 18:54.400
To see the wizard.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.400
Do you have an appointment
with Mr. Hainsley?

19:04.400 --> 19:07.700
Let's just say
he sent us an invitation.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.600
We're... I'm from
Wolfram and Hart.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.800
I'm his date.

<i>Mr. Hainsley is with</i>
<i>a customer at the moment.</i>

19:16.500 --> 19:19.700
I'm afraid he does not suffer
interruption lightly.

19:19.700 --> 19:23.100
I'm not so worried about his suffering.
Go ahead and interrupt.

19:23.100 --> 19:26.300
As you wish.
Please wait here, gentlemen.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.800
Oh, life among
the power elite.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.800
It's all so civilized.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.300
Hainsley grinds up one of your people
into chum, and you drop by for tea.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.600
I'm hopin' to avoid
a body count here.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.600
No worries. Looks like
this Hainsley keeps one on hand.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.200
Man likes to play
with dollies.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.200

But enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.700
<i>You're a ghost.</i>

25:45.700 --> 25:48.000
Close enough anyway.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.300
That's just
a horrible way to be.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.200
<i>You're not here,</i>
<i>you're not there.</i>

25:53.200 --> 25:55.400
Just lost somewhere
in the middle.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.900
<i>You can't fight against it.</i>
<i>You can't fix it.</i>

25:58.900 --> 26:01.700
<i>Hell, you can't even lift a finger</i>
<i>'cause you simply don't have any.</i>

26:01.700 --> 26:03.700
Yeah.
What's it to you?

26:03.700 --> 26:06.900
I can give you back
what's been taken from you.

26:06.900 --> 26:10.000
Freedom.
Power of choice.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.700
I can put your destiny back in
your own flesh-and-bone hands.

26:14.700 --> 26:18.700
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>A corporeal body.</i>

26:18.700 --> 26:21.800
I can make that happen.

26:21.800 --> 26:25.000
But to do that, I need you
to do something for me.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.900
Something that
might require...

26:26.900 --> 26:29.000
Hurt Angel? That it?
You want me to hurt Angel?

26:34.600 --> 26:37.000
You've come
to the right ghost.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.400
<i>Wiped out every asset</i>
<i>we could find on Hainsley.</i>

26:44.400 --> 26:47.300
Wasn't easy. Man's got his fingers
in a lot of dirty pies.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.100
I think pies are gonna be off
his menu for a while.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.900
It's gotta hurt. I mean,
damn, who doesn't love pie?

26:52.900 --> 26:55.200
<i>- [Fred] You're back.</i>
- Hainsley out of business?

26:55.200 --> 26:57.900
- Yeah, for the time being.
- So he's not going away?

26:57.900 --> 27:00.800
I think that "This isn't over yet, vampire"
may be the tip-off.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.400
Guys, can we get back
to my, uh, spiritual crisis?

27:04.400 --> 27:06.400
Yes. Spike.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.200
Popped out at me
at Hainsley's place.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.000
But we all know that
he'll be back, and back...

27:11.000 --> 27:13.300
and back, and I really don't want
that happening again.

27:13.300 --> 27:17.000
So explain to me how we're going
to get him out of here.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.100
He can't
get out of here.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.300
Please don't tell me that.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.200
Okay.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.300
Wesley, you tell him.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.700
I've had my entire department doing
thorough research on the amulet.

27:29.700 --> 27:34.700
There's not much. Not in the way
of releasing Spike from it anyway.

27:34.700 --> 27:37.600
At least not in
the conventional sense.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.700
And what's
the unconventional sense?

27:40.700 --> 27:43.300
Something he asked for.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.700
Eternal rest.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.600
<i>- Fine. Don't talk to me.</i>
- What?

27:56.600 --> 27:59.700
Whole time we were a thing
you treated me like day-old rat blood.

27:59.700 --> 28:03.700
Why should now be any diff?
Just 'cause you've gone all Patrick Swayze.

28:03.700 --> 28:06.700
- What are you on about?
- Well, gee, nothing much.

28:06.700 --> 28:09.400
Just since you're
all soulful now...

28:09.400 --> 28:13.300
I thought maybe, just maybe,
you might have learned to open up a little.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.200
<i>You know, talk.</i>

28:16.200 --> 28:18.900
But I guess a leopard
can't change his stripes.

28:18.900 --> 28:21.900
Spots, you dink.
Leopards have spots.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.900
Oh, excuse me,
Mr. Brainy.

28:23.900 --> 28:27.800
Thank you so much for sharing.
Wow, what a breakthrough.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
<i>[Wesley] Yes, this is</i>
<i>an unusual situation...</i>

28:34.600 --> 28:37.000
<i>but I think it's</i>
<i>our only choice.</i>

28:37.000 --> 28:39.800
<i>It's what we'd do in any case</i>
<i>of a haunting, isn't it?</i>

28:39.800 --> 28:42.000
<i>An exorcism of sorts.</i>

28:43.800 --> 28:47.600
I mean, I know he's already dead,
but he'd be gone dead.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.800
<i>Forever. Itjust</i>
<i>doesn't seem right.</i>

28:50.800 --> 28:53.000
<i>I agree. But neither</i>
<i>is leaving him here.</i>

28:53.000 --> 28:56.100
Trapped between realms,
with no control over his fate...

28:56.100 --> 28:58.700
<i>not able to touch anything,</i>
<i>affect anything.</i>

28:58.700 --> 29:00.700
<i>Unable to fight.</i>

29:00.700 --> 29:03.000
Letting him cross over seems
the most merciful thing we...

29:03.000 --> 29:07.700
Yeah, yeah, mercy. You know,
I'm all for it. Just tell me how we do it.

29:07.700 --> 29:10.500
The amulet's protected,
invulnerable to anything.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.500
But the magic that's protecting it
doesn't work on hallowed ground.

29:13.500 --> 29:17.000
- Hallowed? Like a church?
- Or cemetery, yes.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.300
<i>- It has to be taken there and destroyed.</i>
- Destroyed how?

29:20.300 --> 29:23.200
I think a sharp blow
would probably do the trick.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.700
Angel, what do you think?

29:31.300 --> 29:33.600
Think I want
to sleep on it.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.200
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

30:35.200 --> 30:37.200
Oh, no. No.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.000
No, no!

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Sitting in
luxury's ample lap.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.200
Top of the world...

30:46.200 --> 30:48.200
<i>Iooking down on...</i>

30:48.200 --> 30:50.300
well, everyone.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.800
It's good to be king,
isn't it?

30:53.800 --> 30:57.300
Ground rules: Haunt me all you want
during business hours...

30:57.300 --> 30:59.700
but this space...
off-limits.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.900
Relax, beefcake.
I didn't come for a fight.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.000
- Really?
- Not that I could, right?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Can't touch.
Can't affect anything.

31:11.900 --> 31:15.700
Yeah, I overheard your little group
powwow about me.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.400
- How much?
- Enough of enough.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.200
Look, Spike-

31:20.200 --> 31:24.100
- Necromancer tried to make a deal with me.
- What?

31:24.100 --> 31:27.700
Said he could bring me back,
body and soul...

31:27.700 --> 31:32.500
if I used our close personal relationship
to double-cross you.

31:32.500 --> 31:36.100
Tempting.
And what'd you say?

31:36.100 --> 31:38.200
You see, right there...
that's a problem.

31:38.200 --> 31:43.800
You having to ask me that. I don't play
for that side anymore or haven't you heard.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.500
Besides, even if Mr. Death
could do what he promised...

31:46.500 --> 31:49.400
I trust him about
as much as you trust me.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.500
What do you want from me?

31:54.900 --> 31:56.700
I can't live
like this, Angel.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.000
Bein' useless.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.600
Bein' nothing.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.500
I want it to end.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.300
[Spike]
I suppose this'll do.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.300
Feels hallowed enough.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.700
Sure you want
to do this, Spike?

32:41.700 --> 32:43.800
What? Think I could
really stand hanging out...

32:43.800 --> 32:46.300
with you and your lot
now and forever?

32:46.300 --> 32:49.500
Wisecracking ghost sidekick.
No bloody thanks.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.100
<i>Come on. You know</i>
<i>as well as I do, it's for the best.</i>

32:57.400 --> 33:00.900
I'm glad it's you, though,
finally doin' me in.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.700
Feels right, you bein'
my grandsire and all.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.200
Circle of death, eh?

33:09.600 --> 33:11.500
Good-bye, Spike.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.800
See you around, Angel.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.500
<i>Uh, I think you missed.</i>

33:20.000 --> 33:21.700
[Groaning]

33:23.900 --> 33:26.700
<i>And the dead shall rise.!</i>

33:26.700 --> 33:29.100
Just 'cause I say so.

33:29.100 --> 33:32.500
- Hainsley.
- Vampires should think twice...

33:32.500 --> 33:36.900
before messing with a man
who wields power over all things lifeless.

33:39.900 --> 33:43.700
If you ask my advice.

33:43.700 --> 33:46.200
Took your sweet time
steppin' in, Hainsley.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.700
I came this close to getting
a one-way to the great beyond.

33:48.700 --> 33:52.300
Relax, son. I wasn't going
to let anything happen to you.

33:52.300 --> 33:56.200
<i>- You're the linchpin of my plan.</i>
- Our plan.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.600
And you bloody better hold up
your end of it. I'm not gonna be used by you.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.800
Yes, you are.

34:03.800 --> 34:07.000
But afterwards, I'll give you
your reward, just as you asked.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
I'll put you back
in the driver's seat of your afterlife.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.000
Control.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
<i>That's all anyone</i>
<i>really wants, isn't it?</i>

34:30.000 --> 34:33.800
<i>Hello, vampire.</i>
<i>Have a nice nap?</i>

34:33.800 --> 34:37.300
- No...
<i>- Don't get up. You've had a rough day.</i>

34:37.300 --> 34:41.199
You know, so have I,
thanks to you.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.500
Yours is about to get
a hell of a lot worse.

34:43.500 --> 34:48.800
I don't think so.
Me, necromancer. You, dead.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.800
- You can't lay a finger on me.
- Maybe not.

34:52.800 --> 34:57.500
But what do you think the senior partners
are gonna do to you when I turn up missing?

34:57.500 --> 34:59.400
Oh, you're not going
to be missing.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.100
You're going to show up to work bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed tomorrow morning...

35:03.100 --> 35:06.600
when you reverse the seizure
of my personal assets...

35:06.600 --> 35:10.100
and reinstate the Internment
Acquisitions Department.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.900
- And why would I do that?
<i>- [Spike] Not you.</i>

35:12.900 --> 35:15.400
Me.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.100
Wearin' your body.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.700
And to think
I didn't trust you.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.200
Come on, Angel.
What choice did I have?

35:26.200 --> 35:29.700
Bloody exorcism?
Letting you and yours banish me to oblivion?

35:29.700 --> 35:32.200
No, thanks.

35:32.200 --> 35:36.800
Necro here is gonna give me my body back
after I take yours for a test drive.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.700
Fix his
little problems.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.900
And here's the kicker.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.100
I go in, and you...

35:43.100 --> 35:45.300
go pfft!

35:45.300 --> 35:47.400
Off to Never-Never-
Come-Back-Land.

35:48.700 --> 35:51.900
And then, yours very truly
will be running the show.

35:51.900 --> 35:55.200
Your cars,
your fancy digs, everything.

35:55.200 --> 35:59.000
Every <i>one</i> I deserve
will be mine.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.900
And maybe I'll have
a go with that Fred.

36:03.900 --> 36:07.400
She looks like a goer. And she seems
to really look up to you.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.500
Shut up!

36:09.500 --> 36:12.500
You know what?
You're right.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.600
Enough talk.
Let's do this already.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.900
I'm itching
to get physical.

36:18.900 --> 36:23.400
I've never installed anyone
in a conscious dead body before.

36:23.400 --> 36:27.000
I imagine this is going to be
extremely painful.

36:28.700 --> 36:31.200
[Droning]

37:06.000 --> 37:08.400
[Stammering]

37:09.900 --> 37:13.300
What...
What are you doing?

37:13.300 --> 37:16.300
Spike... Spike...

37:16.300 --> 37:19.300
No. No!

37:22.600 --> 37:24.800
I can touch you now,
Hainsley.

37:28.900 --> 37:32.200
Think you're clever, eh?
But... [Groans]

37:32.200 --> 37:34.400
<i>Your ghost can't</i>
<i>control me for long.</i>

37:34.400 --> 37:37.200
I hold the power.
I rule the dead.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.200
Not today.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.200
Oh, bollocks.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.100
I was just
gettin' warmed up.

38:09.100 --> 38:12.100
- That was you hitting me?
- That last bit, yeah.

38:12.100 --> 38:14.300
Hainsley's been dead
since he hit the table.

38:15.900 --> 38:19.100
Oh, come on. Had to get
a few licks in, didn't I?

38:30.300 --> 38:32.900
<i>I see. So Spike came</i>
<i>to you with this plan.</i>

38:32.900 --> 38:36.400
More or less. Once he learned Hainsley
used himself as a conduit for body transfers...

38:36.400 --> 38:39.200
- our trap fell into place.
- A bit reckless.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.200
<i>[Wesley] If Spike's going to be</i>
<i>sticking around, it'd be prudent ofhim...</i>

38:42.200 --> 38:44.900
to share his plans with the rest of us
in the future.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.500
Yeah, well, uh, sharing's not
something Spike does very well.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.200
Preaching to
the horse's mouth.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.100
Spike.
What are y-you...

39:13.500 --> 39:15.300
Can I help you?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.400
Well, that's the heart of it, isn't it?
The crux. The nub.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.300
I'm sorry?

39:24.900 --> 39:26.900
You're the smart one,
aren't you?

39:26.900 --> 39:31.900
The go-to girl who knows
all about this ghost mumbo jumbo.

39:31.900 --> 39:36.700
Um, well, a-actually Wesley's
the occult expert.

39:36.700 --> 39:40.200
H-He was trained as a Watcher.
He knows about the supernatural.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.600
Yeah, but you're
the science queen.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.900
The hows, the what-ifs,
that's your cup of tea.

39:45.900 --> 39:48.900
You figure things out in that
cute little noggin of yours.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.700
I guess.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.400
What...

39:55.400 --> 39:58.200
l-Is there something...

40:01.300 --> 40:03.500
I'm slippin'.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.700
What?

40:06.700 --> 40:08.600
I don't want to go.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.500
But it's like...

40:10.500 --> 40:15.400
It's like the ground underneath me
is splitting open...

40:15.400 --> 40:20.500
and my legs are straddling both sides
of this bloody big chasm.

40:20.500 --> 40:23.600
It's getting wider
and pulling me in.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.800
Is that...

40:27.800 --> 40:30.800
Is that what's happening
when you keep vanishing?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I know what's down there.

40:38.400 --> 40:42.200
Where it's tryin'
to take me.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.700
And it's not
the place heroes go.

40:44.700 --> 40:47.000
Not by
a bloody long shot.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.700
It's the other one.

40:50.700 --> 40:53.800
Full of fire and torment.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.600
And it's happening.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.000
And I'm terrified.

41:09.800 --> 41:13.600
