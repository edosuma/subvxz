- I did!

17:19.464 --> 17:21.047
- Sugar makes me nuts-o.
- Yeah, hmm.

17:22.634 --> 17:23.634
- I'm hypoglycemic.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.782
- Yeah, she's gonna be
all right.

17:26.738 --> 17:29.305
Um, I think we should
probably get going, though.

17:31.876 --> 17:32.909
We had such a great time.

17:33.945 --> 17:34.945
Thank you guys so much.

17:35.146 --> 17:36.479
- Next time, more protein.

17:37.816 --> 17:38.816
Eat more steak.

17:39.617 --> 17:40.833
- With truffle butter.
- Shh!

17:42.053 --> 17:44.037
Come on.
- Michelle, you so nasty.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.024
- I-I...
- What?

17:47.959 --> 17:49.442
Why am I nasty?

17:51.463 --> 17:53.196
What's wrong
with truffle butter?

17:53.198 --> 17:54.198
- Nothing.
- Google it.

17:55.099 --> 17:56.482
- No, don't, don't.

17:57.869 --> 17:58.902
Just bye, bye.

17:59.938 --> 18:01.755

Jade, open the door!

18:08.947 --> 18:09.629

18:09.714 --> 18:11.554
Um, would you be mad
if I stayed at this party?

18:12.884 --> 18:13.884
No, I thought so.

18:14.185 --> 18:15.401
- Jade Winslow.

18:16.621 --> 18:17.654
- Oh! Hey, Chesty.

18:18.690 --> 18:19.472
- Do you not know my name?

18:19.657 --> 18:21.297
- Is everybody
getting their face painted?

18:24.195 --> 18:25.161
- Where are my pages?

18:25.163 --> 18:26.363
- Oh, is that why you're here?

18:26.931 --> 18:28.331
Is that why
you busted into my party

18:28.533 --> 18:30.533
and threatened my agent
and won't stop harassing me

18:31.936 --> 18:33.486
over some, like, stupid pages?

18:35.039 --> 18:36.039
- Yes.
I need those.

18:36.875 --> 18:38.875
I don't know how you
expect me to publish your book

18:39.844 --> 18:40.844
without them.

18:41.012 --> 18:42.012
- Don't you get it?

18:42.213 --> 18:43.946
Okay, bitch, there is no book.

18:50.655 --> 18:53.656
- I am so screwed.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.031
- Mm.

19:02.033 --> 19:03.033
- Hi.

19:04.035 --> 19:05.035
How you feeling?

19:05.236 --> 19:06.236
- So stupid.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.538
I'm sorry I ate your lollipop.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.040
- It's okay.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.270
For future reference, though,

19:14.279 --> 19:15.359
you're supposed to lick it.

19:15.513 --> 19:17.363
You're not supposed to eat
the whole thing.

19:19.217 --> 19:19.599
- Mm.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.101
- Why'd you do it, though?

19:24.222 --> 19:24.487
Hmm?

19:24.756 --> 19:26.456
- Michelle sort of
got under my skin.

19:28.159 --> 19:29.159
- About what?

19:29.627 --> 19:30.710
- About...

19:31.796 --> 19:32.796
Don't worry about it.

19:33.565 --> 19:34.565
- Come on.

19:34.866 --> 19:36.346
If we're gonna have
this relationship,

19:37.035 --> 19:38.035
we have to talk.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.602
You can't hide from everything.

19:40.905 --> 19:42.105
- Okay.

19:46.144 --> 19:51.113
Michelle sort of pointed out
that the math between us

19:51.115 --> 19:52.198
presents problems.

19:53.284 --> 19:54.434
- And what do you think?

19:55.587 --> 19:57.837
- I think she's not wrong.

20:00.091 --> 20:01.091
- [sighs]

20:01.926 --> 20:02.926
Go on.

20:03.127 --> 20:03.909
- I guess I kind of do worry

20:04.095 --> 20:05.628
that this has
an expiration date.

20:08.733 --> 20:11.634
- Really?

20:11.636 --> 20:12.636
Why?

20:12.737 --> 20:14.203
- A lot of reasons?

20:15.673 --> 20:17.840
I mean, maybe you'll want
to have kids someday.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.060
- Maybe.

20:22.113 --> 20:23.113
- Right.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.048
- Maybe we should
just get married

20:26.751 --> 20:27.751
and start having kids.

20:28.620 --> 20:29.620
- [laughs softly]

20:30.622 --> 20:31.421
Shut up.
