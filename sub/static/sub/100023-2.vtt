01:08.234 --> 01:09.234
Hi.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.072
I think I'm in trouble.
Can you come get me?

01:29.714 --> 01:31.216
Next time get yourself home.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.178
I was in my pajamas.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.181
Police haven't shared any information
about this woman,

02:20.265 --> 02:23.852
except to say the claims she made
about being raped in this building

02:23.935 --> 02:26.604
by a masked intruder
were in fact fabricated.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.148
Completely made up.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.692
Many of the residents
in these Oakdale Apartments

02:30.775 --> 02:32.569
are part of the Rise Up program,

02:32.652 --> 02:34.863
which helps young adults
transition while...

02:49.335 --> 02:50.837
Yeah, Detective Parker.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.631
Hey, Detective, Tom Diefenbach,
over at Crime Victims Comp.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.300
Hey, Tom, how ya doing?

02:55.383 --> 02:56.801
<i>Good. While I'm catching up here,</i>

02:56.885 --> 02:59.262
I've got a sexual assault from the 11th.

02:59.804 --> 03:04.517
Case number L241-007R.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.353
<i>Can you send over the crime report
and any follow ups,</i>

03:07.437 --> 03:09.230
<i>so I can figure out
what kind of compensation</i>

03:09.314 --> 03:11.834
<i>- the victim's eligible for?
- </i> Yeah, don't... don't bother, none.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.402
<i>Oh, we cover a lot more
than basic medical now.</i>

03:14.485 --> 03:17.322
We do mental health expenses, lost wages...

03:17.405 --> 03:20.241
Yeah, yeah, not with this one.
Uh, it was bogus.

03:20.491 --> 03:21.491
She made it up.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.953
<i>- </i> What?
<i>- Yeah. Total fiction.</i>

03:24.037 --> 03:26.623
We closed it.
I just changed the status in the system.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.959
It should disappear from your list
in about an hour.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.438
- What happened there?
<i>- Don't get me started.</i>

03:32.462 --> 03:35.340
I mean, the amount of time and energy
we spent on this, it's just...

03:36.216 --> 03:37.217
pain in the ass.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.300
<i>I can imagine.</i>

03:38.718 --> 03:42.180
But one less rape in the world.
That's ultimately a good thing, right?

03:57.487 --> 03:58.321
What's her O2?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.049
<i>Ninety-two, but she's breathing fine.</i>

04:00.073 --> 04:02.033
<i>Congested,
but that's just the cause of the cold.</i>

04:02.116 --> 04:03.243
Use the nebulizer.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.745
<i>Honey, for now,
she's just a kid with a cold.</i>

04:05.828 --> 04:08.039
<i>Let's let her sleep.
Let her body do its thing.</i>

04:08.122 --> 04:10.122
<i>Car 12, do you copy?</i>

04:10.291 --> 04:12.460
Okay, one more hour and then nebulize.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.063
- <i>Yes, ma'am.
- </i> I mean it.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.380
<i>I think I just said yes.</i>

04:16.172 --> 04:17.548
<i>Go do your job, I got this.</i>

04:17.839 --> 04:19.132
Okay, bye.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.803
Go for 12.

04:23.221 --> 04:27.016
<i>You have a 1035
at the Blackhill Apartments, 1103 Davis.</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:30.937
<i>That's 1103 David, Adam, Victor, Ida, Sam.</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:32.605
Ten-four, I'm en route.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.161
Hey, what do we got?

04:47.620 --> 04:50.707
Intruder, sexual assault.
That apartment back there, B-4.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.875
Happened this morning.
She called it in around noon.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.210
The victim is

04:54.794 --> 04:56.754
Amber Stevenson, 22 years old.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.005
Where is she?

04:59.382 --> 05:00.382
She was just here.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.895
All right, we're moving in three.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.525
Never mind.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.153
Is everything under there?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.031
Amber?

05:24.657 --> 05:25.908
- Oh.
- Hi.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.411
I'm Detective Karen Duvall.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.455
Hi. How are you?

05:31.205 --> 05:32.206
I'm fine.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.832
How are you?

05:34.917 --> 05:37.587
Are you injured physically?
Would you like to see a paramedic?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.797
No. They checked me out already. I'm fine.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.967
Let me know if that decision changes.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.762
Sometimes pain can sneak up on you.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.305
They're right here.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.265
And they're here for you.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.682
Okay.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.104
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to ask you some questions.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.730
Sure.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.984
It's a little busy out here.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.987
Would you be comfortable talking
in my car?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.071
Yeah, that's fine.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.865
Okay, good. That's me right here.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.708
Thanks.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.390
You okay?

06:31.974 --> 06:32.974
You comfortable?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.769
Yeah. I'm good.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.772
Amber, all our research has shown

06:37.855 --> 06:40.358
that the sooner a victim of a crime
talks about it,

06:40.566 --> 06:42.693
the better his or her recall is, so...

06:43.611 --> 06:45.071
if it's all right with you,

06:45.154 --> 06:46.531
I'd like to dive right in.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.617
Sure.
Um, where would you like me to start?

06:51.494 --> 06:52.912
Let's start with background.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.790
That's your building there?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.042
Uh, yeah. Apartment B-4.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.294
How long have you lived there?

07:00.920 --> 07:01.963
Three months.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.549
I moved out here for school.
I'm at Tabor College.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.885
- What are you studying?
- Computer science.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.263
Smart. A lot of work in that field.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.014
- Mm-hmm.
- Where'd you move from?

07:12.098 --> 07:13.098
Chicago.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.434
You miss it?

07:15.726 --> 07:18.563
Yeah. But it's... it's nice here too.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.608
You live there alone?

07:22.942 --> 07:23.942
Yeah.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.444
Okay.

07:26.863 --> 07:27.989
Now about today.

07:28.739 --> 07:32.910
My colleague Detective Wilson,
he says the assault happened this morning.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.121
Mm-hmm. Early.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.624
Before the assault, can you tell me
a little about where you were,

07:38.708 --> 07:39.876
what you were doing?

07:39.959 --> 07:42.712
Um, I was sleeping.
I stayed up really late.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.424
My boyfriend was visiting from Chicago
and he left yesterday.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.051
I always do that when he leaves,
stay up late.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.096
It's like, all of a sudden,
I can't sleep without him, you know?

07:52.930 --> 07:53.931
I do.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.809
- What's your boyfriend's name?
- Eric.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.519
Eric Llewyn.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.441
Have you told him what happened?

08:03.733 --> 08:04.733
Mm-mm.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.487
I, um, I haven't told anyone.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.824
No parents? No friends?

08:11.908 --> 08:12.909
Just you.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.577
I mean, 911.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.329
Is that weird?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.082
- No.
- Just, the thing is, um...

08:20.458 --> 08:22.210
Eric's super protective of me,

08:22.293 --> 08:25.087
so as soon as I tell him,
he's gonna to be...

08:25.171 --> 08:27.840
Amber, you don't have to explain yourself
to me.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.260
Who you choose to tell,
when you choose to tell them,

08:32.511 --> 08:34.222
that is entirely your decision.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.724
Just wanted to know.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.312
Okay.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.360
So you were asleep?

08:47.818 --> 08:49.570
In your bed, on the sofa?

08:49.654 --> 08:51.030
- In my bed.
- Got it.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.701
Then what?

09:04.126 --> 09:06.587
I saw a guy walking around
the complex last night.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.382
Stocky, cowboy boots.
Never seen him before.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.511
There's a guy who lives here
I always thought was shady.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.929
Walks around with a headlamp on.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.729
How's the door?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.357
Flimsy.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.403
I'm just trying to think
if I left anything out.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.654
Take your time.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.659
Um...

09:38.452 --> 09:40.288
yeah. No, I...

09:41.497 --> 09:42.832
I think that's everything.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.502
And once you realized he was gone,
what'd you do then?

09:46.586 --> 09:47.712
I called 911.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.133
- Even though he told you not to?
- Well, yeah. I mean, of course.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.096
- Do you know roughly what time it was?
- 12:32.

09:58.055 --> 10:01.058
I... I checked.
I, um, I figured it mattered.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.102
You're right. It does.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.026
This is very helpful, Amber.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.821
The level of detail you're able
to remember gives me a lot to work with.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.281
- Thank you for that.
- Sure.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.746
I wanna talk to you
about physical evidence.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.999
Every rape has three crime scenes.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.084
The location of the assault,

10:28.002 --> 10:29.378
the body of the attacker,

10:30.254 --> 10:31.756
and the body of the victim.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.509
Each of them can offer up
important information.

10:36.010 --> 10:40.139
Now, the hospital will do a thorough exam
of your body.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.183
But would you be comfortable

10:42.266 --> 10:46.020
with me trying to collect DNA evidence
from your face now?

10:46.354 --> 10:47.354
Yeah.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.858
But like I said, he made me shower
and wash my face.

10:50.941 --> 10:54.028
I... I understand.
Still, I'd like to check.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.738
Okay.

11:37.988 --> 11:38.988
Okay.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.158
Thank you.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.875
There's one more thing
I'd like to ask you to do.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.421
Detective.

12:07.101 --> 12:10.563
So, anything you remember him touching.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.356
Anything he might have touched.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.774
Anything at all.

12:14.942 --> 12:15.942
Okay.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.362
Um, but like I said, he wore gloves.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.322
If they're gloves he's worn before,

12:20.406 --> 12:23.284
there can be DNA on the outside of them
that can transfer.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.913
Um, well, the doorknobs definitely.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.205
Got those.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.876
He peed a few times, so...

12:32.293 --> 12:34.128
the flusher thing on the toilet.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.714
Um, I... I don't know
if he touched the seat.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.813
Do you smoke?

12:53.481 --> 12:54.481
No.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.445
Um...

13:02.072 --> 13:03.115
that comforter.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.701
He touched that?

13:06.327 --> 13:07.327
Yeah.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.539
I was cold. He put it over me.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.875
Sorry, I forgot to tell you that before.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.211
That's okay. That's why we're here.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.633
Uh, when did he do that? At what stage?

13:20.883 --> 13:23.552
Um, maybe like halfway through.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.223
He saw me shivering.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.893
So, he covered you,

13:31.769 --> 13:32.895
so you'd be warm?

13:32.978 --> 13:34.188
Yeah. And, um...

13:35.064 --> 13:38.567
like, when he left, he... he told me
to put a dowel in my sliding door

13:38.651 --> 13:40.569
so that this wouldn't happen to me again.

13:41.612 --> 13:46.367
He... he said, "You need
to be more protective of yourself."

13:48.828 --> 13:49.954
I guess he was right.

13:53.833 --> 13:58.504
I know both these nurses. They're great.
Well-trained, respectful.

13:58.921 --> 13:59.921
Okay.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.675
But even so, it's a long exam,

14:03.259 --> 14:05.845
and they'll need to examine
every inch of your body,

14:05.928 --> 14:07.137
inside and out.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.683
- I understand.
- You're good.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.895
I can't stay.
I need to get back to the investigation.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.857
Is there a friend you'd like to call?

14:19.108 --> 14:20.150
Um...

14:20.609 --> 14:22.319
- maybe not yet.
- Okay.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.703
It's just like,
then it's this whole thing.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.081
You don't need to explain
any of your decisions to me.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.293
- I know, I just... I do have friends.
- Mm.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.043
I just...

14:39.795 --> 14:41.922
don't feel like talking to them yet.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.674
I understand.

14:44.466 --> 14:48.137
There's a counselor who will stay with you
through the whole exam.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.555
She's excellent.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.309
If you change your mind
and decide that you do wanna call someone,

14:53.893 --> 14:55.019
just let her know.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.102
Okay.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.647
There's just one more thing.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.153
Um, about him, about the guy.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.237
What's that?

15:05.487 --> 15:08.449
Um, he told me this was his first rape,

15:08.949 --> 15:10.492
but I don't think that's true.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.370
I think he's done this before.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.613
<i>Can I get an associate to 29-E?</i>

15:50.032 --> 15:51.617
Nice of you to join us.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.620
I know, I'm... I'm...

15:55.329 --> 15:56.413
I'm really sorry.

15:57.122 --> 16:00.376
I, uh... I couldn't...
I couldn't get out of my apartment.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.879
The door was messed up.
The... the doorknob. I... I...

16:04.421 --> 16:07.132
just moved in yesterday.
I switched apartments and...

16:07.549 --> 16:10.636
it got busted somehow. So, I was like...

16:11.470 --> 16:14.139
stuck, and I had to call the super
and everything.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.016
It was... just a mess.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.771
- I'm sorry.
- Your work day starts at eight.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.357
In the future,
if you can't get here on time,

16:23.440 --> 16:24.566
don't come in at all, okay?

16:25.985 --> 16:26.985
Okay.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.209
Am I supposed to help myself or what?

16:43.585 --> 16:45.546
So sorry. I got it.

16:56.557 --> 16:57.850
I only need one.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.271
Right.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.025
Aren't you supposed to use those?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.114
Thanks.

17:23.666 --> 17:27.503
Would you like to try a... a sample
from our new electric hibachi?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.407
- How's it look?
- Pretty fucking clean.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.621
He knew everything:

18:00.954 --> 18:02.790
What classes she was taking,

18:03.457 --> 18:06.001
her license plate number,
her passport number...

18:09.088 --> 18:12.508
He knew she talks to herself in the mirror
every night before bed.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.135
So he was watching her.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.805
A lot.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.559
- You got a shoe print?
- Partial, just the heel.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.436
That mud's soft.
Hit it with hairspray first

18:24.520 --> 18:26.563
before you take the impression
to lock it in place.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.023
You got it, Detective.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.085
This wasn't his first time in here.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.951
- He'd broken in before.
- How do you know?

18:39.034 --> 18:42.538
She lost a hair ribbon a couple weeks ago.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.833
She was sure she put it in a drawer.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.418
When she went to go get it...

18:49.837 --> 18:51.130
it wasn't there.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.300
She figured she'd just misplaced it
or something.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.512
And then,
in the beginning of this whole ordeal,

18:59.138 --> 19:01.849
guy reaches into his backpack,
guess what he pulls out?

19:01.932 --> 19:04.476
- Whoa.
- He used it to tie her up.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.521
Her own hair ribbon.
He brought it for that purpose.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.857
That's fucked up.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.194
Yes, it is.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.324
I got a couple guys out here
who could use a rest.

19:19.366 --> 19:22.077
- How about we call a bathroom break?
- No. Keep working.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.915
He raped her for four hours.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.085
At gunpoint.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.755
She figured her best chance
of staying alive was to keep him talking.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.342
So she asked some questions about himself,
pretended to be curious.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.680
Can you imagine the presence of mind?

19:42.556 --> 19:43.599
What did she learn?

19:44.099 --> 19:45.976
He speaks four languages.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.854
He's traveled.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.815
Korea, Thailand,

19:52.816 --> 19:53.901
Philippines.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.610
Military.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.196
Maybe. Yeah.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.949
He told her his theory of humanity.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.078
He said every man's
either a wolf or a bravo.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.581
Bravos never hurt women or children.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.541
Wolves do...

20:11.210 --> 20:13.462
whatever they want to whoever they want,

20:15.088 --> 20:16.632
regardless of consequence.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.179
He's a wolf.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.892
I need you to pull
all the stranger sexual assaults

20:26.975 --> 20:28.810
in our district from the last year.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.646
<i>Copy that.</i>
- Um...

20:31.104 --> 20:33.774
pull all the hot prowls too
and the peeping toms.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.485
<i>- Will do.</i>
- Any, uh, suspicious man calls.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.195
Burglaries too.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.590
Any burglary within a five-mile radius...

20:40.614 --> 20:43.158
- of this Blackhill address.
- <i>Okay. That's a lot of files.</i>

20:43.742 --> 20:45.118
Yes, it is.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.512
- How is she?
<i>- Better.</i>

20:46.536 --> 20:49.873
<i>Her O2 dropped to 91 at 1:00,
but it was back up to 93 by 3:00.</i>

20:49.957 --> 20:52.334
<i>And she sounds fine,
not gaspy or anything.</i>

20:52.417 --> 20:54.211
<i>- I think we're good.</i>
- Okay. Good.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.564
<i>- And your mom called.
- </i> Why does she call during the day?

20:56.588 --> 20:58.757
- She knows I'm not home.
<i>- 'Cause she knows I am.</i>

20:58.840 --> 21:01.051
<i>And she loves me more than she loves you.</i>

21:03.428 --> 21:04.846
<i>Hey. You good?</i>

21:06.431 --> 21:07.431
Yeah.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.643
I'm just, you know...

21:10.269 --> 21:12.354
<i>Okay. Well, we're all good here.</i>

21:12.437 --> 21:14.147
<i>So, Daisy's at Eve's till 4:00.</i>

21:14.231 --> 21:16.358
<i>I'll fill you in on the rest
when you get home.</i>

21:16.984 --> 21:18.819
Okay. Thanks.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.908
Great. The doctor will see you then. Bye.

21:26.994 --> 21:27.994
Hi, Detective.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.997
- Hey, how's it going?
- Almost done.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.916
- She's doing great.
- Would you let her know I'm here

21:33.000 --> 21:34.960
and ask her if she wants me to come in?

21:35.043 --> 21:36.753
Make it clear if she doesn't,

21:37.254 --> 21:38.255
that's absolutely fine.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.338
Will do.

21:51.518 --> 21:55.022
Hey, Carmen, Detective Duvall.
Is conference room three available?

21:55.814 --> 21:57.254
Great, will you block it off for me?

21:57.316 --> 22:00.235
The sexual assault at the Blackhill
that came in at midday.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.694
Thank you.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.155
She'd like to see you.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.586
Hi, Amber.

22:19.838 --> 22:20.881
How you doin'?

22:21.757 --> 22:22.757
I'm okay.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.216
Good.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.386
Did they find anything?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.848
The cops? Any evidence or whatever?

22:30.265 --> 22:32.142
A few things, it's...

22:32.976 --> 22:36.188
it's too early to say if any of it
is related to the assailant,

22:36.438 --> 22:38.774
but all of it will be thoroughly examined.

22:41.735 --> 22:42.735
Okay.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.533
He seemed like he really knew
what he was doing, you know?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.495
He was really careful.

22:52.871 --> 22:57.292
Okay, Amber, I've got some medications
here for you and some paperwork.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.086
We can go through it now if you like.

22:59.169 --> 23:02.047
But if you'd prefer to keep resting
for a bit, that's fine too.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.216
You can do it later. Entirely up to you.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.683
Do you know where you wanna go?

23:13.767 --> 23:15.394
Um...

23:16.353 --> 23:17.687
not home.

23:17.771 --> 23:18.771
Okay.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.358
Is there a friend you can stay with?

23:21.691 --> 23:23.318
Yeah. Um...

23:23.402 --> 23:24.986
Yeah, I just, I gotta call her.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.618
Sorry. Thank you.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.307
Yeah. Um...

23:55.183 --> 23:56.183
I...

23:58.270 --> 23:59.270
Oh.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.940
I, uh...

24:02.023 --> 24:03.483
I can't go home.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.236
Can I, um...

24:07.154 --> 24:09.906
Can I... can I come to you?

24:11.366 --> 24:12.742
Can I come stay with you?

24:24.629 --> 24:25.839
Is that your family?

24:27.007 --> 24:28.007
Yeah.

24:29.843 --> 24:30.843
Cute girls.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.553
Thanks.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.185
What's that?

24:41.563 --> 24:42.563
Uh...

24:43.482 --> 24:45.150
that's just a little reminder.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.569
- Of what?
- What I'm doing, I guess.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.529
It's from Isaiah.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.532
God shows up...

24:54.159 --> 24:56.161
looking for someone to be of service.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.498
Clean things up a bit.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.126
He says, "Whom shall I send?"

25:19.142 --> 25:20.810
So, this is my cell.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.355
Just call anytime.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.730
Okay.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.364
Okay, I'm making dinner,

25:32.447 --> 25:36.034
and there's a hot bath waiting for you,
and a cup of tea and some wine.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.775
I didn't know which you'd want.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.455
Thank you for taking care of her.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.043
Get some rest. I'll be in touch.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.973
Three suspicious males mentioned
by the neighbors.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.099
We tracked down one.

25:59.182 --> 26:02.644
He was at work all morning.
Confirmed by coworkers, boss, and video.

26:03.186 --> 26:06.231
Another was in a Winnebago parked
in front of the complex for a few days.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.484
It had moved on by the time
of the assault, but we're following up.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.654
And the third is a resident of the complex
who wasn't home when we knocked.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.017
This will all be in the reports.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.617
- Which I'll get by...
- It'll be ready by the morning.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.054
- I got my guys working on 'em now.
- Tell 'em to be thorough.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.456
If I get one like that piece of garbage
Inky filed on the B and E...

26:23.540 --> 26:25.750
- I'll make sure.
- You saw that thing, right?

26:26.042 --> 26:28.712
It's practically scrawled
on a cocktail napkin.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.089
He's aware. It won't happen again.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.757
Good.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.802
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.731
I don't know if he made a noise,

26:47.814 --> 26:50.358
or if I just sensed him there,
but all of a sudden,

26:50.442 --> 26:51.711
<i>I was wide-awake.</i>

26:51.735 --> 26:53.087
<i>Do you know
what kind of gun it was?</i>

26:53.111 --> 26:54.404
<i>I don't know about guns.</i>

26:54.571 --> 26:56.114
If you scream, I'll kill you.

26:56.489 --> 26:57.407
<i>I have money.</i>

26:57.490 --> 27:00.327
Fuck you. Take those off.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.788
- <i>Then he dressed me up.
- How?</i>

27:06.416 --> 27:08.335
He wanted me to look like a hooker.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.337
And like a little girl.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.881
- <i>Both.</i>
- Lie down.

27:18.678 --> 27:19.846
Here you go, Detective.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.614
Then he started.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.118
And then he would just stop.

27:42.535 --> 27:44.120
He did that eight times.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.831
Stopped and then started again.

27:47.248 --> 27:49.935
- <i>And each time he just sat there?
- Or took pictures.</i>

27:49.959 --> 27:51.959
<i>He was white.</i>

27:52.087 --> 27:54.839
Around six-two, 170, 180 maybe.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.175
- So fairly lean.
- Yeah.

27:57.467 --> 28:00.220
<i>But with a belly,
like he wasn't in shape.</i>

28:01.888 --> 28:05.684
<i>He was wearing black sneakers,
gray sweatpants with holes in the knees.</i>

28:05.767 --> 28:09.979
<i>He had blond hair on his arms and legs,
but his pubic hair was shaved.</i>

28:11.898 --> 28:13.608
<i>And he has a birthmark. A big one.</i>

28:14.734 --> 28:15.734
Where?

28:18.154 --> 28:19.197
His left calf?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.534
Or looking at him, was it on your left?

28:22.826 --> 28:23.826
His left.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.454
You sure about that?

28:26.746 --> 28:27.746
Yes.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.432
Marie. Got a minute?

28:47.267 --> 28:48.267
Yeah.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.649
How you doing, Marie?

28:56.484 --> 28:58.778
- I'm okay.
- Work's okay? Classes okay?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.531
Yeah, work's good. Yeah.

29:01.614 --> 29:05.368
I didn't get to make it
to that photography class.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.828
I was just, um...

29:08.371 --> 29:10.665
But I... I'll... I'll just go next week

29:10.749 --> 29:13.251
and email the teacher
to find out what I missed.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.711
Okay, sounds good.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.588
So, listen.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.340
I hope you know by now
how much we love you here.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.176
Yeah. We think you're awesome.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.762
And we're serious about the commitment
we made to you.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.805
To this whole transition
out of foster care.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.849
It's hard.
Nobody expects it to be seamless.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.492
Lots of our kids hit bumps in the road.

29:29.517 --> 29:31.227
- Most of them.
- Most of them, yeah.

29:31.811 --> 29:34.397
And this whole thing
definitely qualifies as a bump.

29:34.689 --> 29:35.689
Right?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.194
But that's what we're here for.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.611
The thing is,

29:41.029 --> 29:43.364
we also have an obligation
to this community.

29:43.740 --> 29:47.869
To the agreements that hold it together.
And the most important of those is that

29:48.161 --> 29:49.746
we be straight with each other.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.791
Can't have community without trust, right?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.503
So, not surprisingly,

29:57.045 --> 29:59.506
this whole thing has shaken
people's trust in you.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.549
So we need to address that.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.843
Make some changes to restore that trust.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.054
Wh... what kind of changes?

30:06.137 --> 30:07.948
We're gonna cut back on some
of your freedoms.

30:07.972 --> 30:11.351
Knock your curfew back an hour.
Not forever, but for the time being.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.812
And we're going to do mandatory
daily check-ins.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.313
Why?

30:15.396 --> 30:18.858
I think better communication
will help you to stay on track.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.735
And it'll help us get in there early

30:20.819 --> 30:23.238
and help you process things
before they get out of hand.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.365
- So nothing like this happens again.
- It won't.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.575
We just want to have a mechanism in place.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.661
Well, why? It... it... it's...

30:30.453 --> 30:32.580
It's stupid. Why would I do that again?

30:33.623 --> 30:36.209
It's not like it did me any good.
I mean, everyone hates me.

30:36.292 --> 30:39.504
- I can't even leave my apartment.
- It's important for other kids to see

30:39.587 --> 30:41.881
there are consequences to your actions.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.468
Oh, so this is about them.
It has nothing to do with me.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.553
It's for all of us.

30:48.304 --> 30:50.640
- That's bullshit.
- Nine o'clock curfew.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.935
Nightly 8:45 check-in
with whoever's on duty.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.646
Hey, sweetheart.

31:40.356 --> 31:41.190
Hi.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.460
When I heard the noise,
I thought you were the raccoons.

31:43.484 --> 31:46.946
- Oh, no, it's... it's just me.
- Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.368
How you doing, kiddo?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.414
I'm so sorry, honey. God.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.124
Um...

31:59.208 --> 32:03.129
I thought maybe if I could watch
<i>The Bachelor </i> with Colleen, it would, um...

32:04.422 --> 32:07.008
- I don't know, it would, you know...
- Take your mind off stuff.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.635
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I guess, yeah.

32:08.718 --> 32:12.764
It's a good idea, but she's not here.
She's out at a neighborhood meeting.

32:12.847 --> 32:16.434
Um... Okay. Well, maybe I could
just, uh, wait for her.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.187
Uh, I think she's gonna be out late, hon.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.689
I mean, their agenda was, like,
a mile and a half long.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.650
Okay? Well, then I can just, um...

32:24.359 --> 32:27.028
I can watch it by myself.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.448
I don't think that's gonna work either.
Um...

32:32.325 --> 32:35.036
Marie, hon.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.455
You know, I love you.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.501
It's just that right now,
on the heels of all this stuff,

32:41.584 --> 32:42.961
it's probably better...

32:44.504 --> 32:48.633
for you and me not to spend time together
when Colleen's not around too.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.635
Why?

32:51.719 --> 32:53.513
We're foster parents, Marie.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.474
We can't have the slightest blot
on our record.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.476
Okay, so I... I'm... I'm a blot?

32:58.768 --> 33:01.688
No, honey. God, no, you're wonderful.

33:01.771 --> 33:04.357
You know I think the world of you.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.401
Look, it...

33:10.655 --> 33:12.281
I'm not a psychiatrist.

33:13.241 --> 33:16.661
I don't know what made you say that thing
about being attacked.

33:16.744 --> 33:17.787
And I'm not judging.

33:18.454 --> 33:21.249
After all you've been through
and all you've overcome,

33:21.332 --> 33:25.545
hey, even the strongest, best-adjusted kid
is gonna come out of that with some

33:25.878 --> 33:28.715
complicated stuff. And again, no judgment.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.173
I get it.

33:30.466 --> 33:31.466
It's just that...

33:32.343 --> 33:36.222
If you were to ever say anything
like that about me...

33:38.474 --> 33:39.851
It's not personal.

33:39.934 --> 33:42.145
Marie, please, you gotta understand that.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.148
I just have to think of myself

33:45.231 --> 33:49.068
and of all the kids
we want to be able to help here.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.237
Like you were once. Yeah?

33:51.571 --> 33:55.408
Honey, when Colleen's around,
you're more than welcome, anytime.

33:55.491 --> 33:57.535
Hey, ev... even later tonight would work.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.245
- Yeah?
- Uh...

33:59.328 --> 34:01.164
I'll tell her
to call you when she gets home.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.433
That's good. I'm okay.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.137
- I'm sure she won't mind coming to pick...
- I'm all right.

35:09.732 --> 35:10.732
Hello.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.736
I'm Detective Duvall
with the Golden Police Department,

35:13.820 --> 35:17.156
investigating an assault that happened
in this complex this morning.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.117
Do you have a couple minutes to talk?

35:22.203 --> 35:23.454
Mom!

35:24.205 --> 35:27.542
I heard about it from my neighbor Jenny
when we got back this afternoon.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.210
I just... I can't...

35:29.919 --> 35:31.462
When you got back from where?

35:31.546 --> 35:33.756
A camping trip with some friends.

35:33.840 --> 35:34.924
We do it every year.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.635
- How long were you gone?
- Just four days. A long weekend.

35:37.885 --> 35:40.012
- We? That's you and...
- Me and Rowey.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.098
Yeah, it's just us two here.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.433
One small, happy family.

35:44.725 --> 35:47.687
Was it a self-guided trip,
or... or did you use an outfitter?

35:47.770 --> 35:48.855
Oh, self-guided.

35:48.938 --> 35:50.982
Those outfitters,
they'll cost an arm and a leg.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.692
Yeah, no kidding.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.445
So your friends can confirm
you were both there?

35:59.448 --> 36:00.825
Why would they need to do that?

36:05.329 --> 36:07.540
- Did someone accuse Rowey of this?
- No.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.961
- No one has accused him of anything.
- But someone mentioned him.

36:13.629 --> 36:16.757
Mrs. Wilson,
when something like this happens

36:17.175 --> 36:19.635
and people feel suddenly unsafe...

36:19.719 --> 36:22.513
- My son's not a rapist, Detective.
- Did not say he was.

36:34.984 --> 36:35.984
You know,

36:37.153 --> 36:40.573
if one person in this complex
had taken the time to get to know him,

36:40.656 --> 36:42.867
- it really doesn't take much.
- Mrs. Wilson...

36:44.827 --> 36:46.746
I've known a lot of men, Detective,

36:46.829 --> 36:48.748
and it's never the oddballs, okay?

36:49.332 --> 36:50.791
It's the guys that look nice.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.253
The ones that offer to carry
your groceries and buy you a drink.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.256
Those are the ones that turn around
and mess you up.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.719
That's who we were camping with.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.639
Unless you have any other questions...

37:21.614 --> 37:22.615
Hey.

37:22.949 --> 37:23.949
Hey.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.120
Oh, sorry.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.957
It's, uh, it's okay.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.375
They were hungry.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.003
Did she eat?

37:36.754 --> 37:37.754
A little.

37:38.005 --> 37:39.757
<i>♪...My one desire ♪</i>

37:42.134 --> 37:46.055

37:58.401 --> 37:59.777
I just took it.

38:00.569 --> 38:01.612
Ninety-four.

38:02.363 --> 38:05.324
- Hey, that's not bad.
- No, I think we're good.

38:31.225 --> 38:32.225
This is good.

38:32.643 --> 38:33.643
Thank you.

38:34.353 --> 38:35.563
I didn't make it.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.818
She did not.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.362
She did say it was for all of us.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.406
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.158
You and your inconvenient family?

38:48.075 --> 38:50.244
We're moments away from her
showing up here

38:50.328 --> 38:52.747
in a bikini, saying she locked herself out
of her house

38:52.830 --> 38:56.000
and can you please come help her,
you big, strong police officer?

38:59.128 --> 39:00.128
She's lonely.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.465
Everyone's lonely.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.721
A new case?

39:12.600 --> 39:13.934
You wanna talk about it?

39:18.814 --> 39:19.899
I fixed that drip.

39:20.691 --> 39:21.691
Oh, shoot.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.445
- I was gonna do that.
- I did a half-ass job.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.004
It'll need to be redone in, like, a day.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.292
It's a rape.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.338
Hmm.

39:43.881 --> 39:44.881
Yeah.

39:46.884 --> 39:47.884
Hmm.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.267
Then when he's finally satisfied
with her scrubbing,

39:55.559 --> 39:56.894
he lets her out of the shower

39:56.977 --> 39:59.188
but tells her to stay in the bathroom
until he leaves.

39:59.271 --> 40:00.271
Which she does.

40:00.314 --> 40:03.234
When she hears the door click,
she comes out, he's gone.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.361
So was almost everything he touched.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.947
Her bed sheets, her pillow covers...

40:08.364 --> 40:12.410
I sent a couple things out to the lab,
but from the scene itself, nothing.

40:12.701 --> 40:14.829
Not a hair. Not a fluid.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.872
Nothing. Clean.

40:23.671 --> 40:24.755
He felt smart.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.551
Yeah, but you're smarter.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.992
He took pictures.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.243
The whole time.

40:55.035 --> 40:56.787
Horrible pictures of her

40:57.538 --> 40:59.039
tied up, splayed out.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.874
Said if she told anyone, he'd post them
online with her name and everything.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.880
She called us anyway.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.424
And I asked her why.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.968
She said 'cause she knows
he's gonna do it again

41:11.552 --> 41:12.803
to some other girl.

41:13.554 --> 41:14.739
And she couldn't live with herself

41:14.763 --> 41:17.391
if she didn't at least try
to keep that from happening.

41:25.232 --> 41:26.901
She is one brave young woman.

41:28.736 --> 41:29.987
Did he have a backpack?

41:30.321 --> 41:31.155
What?

41:31.238 --> 41:32.531
The guy. When he did it.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.575
Was he wearing a backpack?

41:35.451 --> 41:37.536
- Yeah. Why?
- We had one like that.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.207
- You should call our detective.
- Who is it?

- Jesus. Fuck! Would...

42:53.737 --> 42:56.699
- Would you get that thing out of my face?
- Oh, sorry about that.

42:58.909 --> 42:59.743
What the fuck?

42:59.827 --> 43:03.038
You know what's funny? I was just asking
myself the same question. What the fuck?

43:03.122 --> 43:06.792
What the fuck is a grown man doing
crawling through the woods,

43:06.875 --> 43:09.712
dressed head to toe like a goddamn
SWAT team member,

43:09.795 --> 43:11.589
in the middle of the night,
behind a building

43:11.672 --> 43:13.215
where a woman was raped last month?

43:13.299 --> 43:15.634
What? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

43:16.468 --> 43:17.720
Who the fuck are you anyway?

43:17.803 --> 43:20.139
Grace Rasmussen, detective,
Westminster PD.

43:20.389 --> 43:23.434
More importantly, friend,
who the fuck are you?
