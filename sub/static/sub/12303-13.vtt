01:40.078 --> 01:41.849
What happened here, Frank ?

01:43.800 --> 01:45.430
People gathered for a concert.

01:45.566 --> 01:47.524
Next thing you know,
two shots ring out.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.385
These two get dropped.

01:49.511 --> 01:50.395
Witnesses ?

01:50.521 --> 01:52.790
Those who stuck around
didn't see or hear anything.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.804
Just another day in Miami.

01:56.380 --> 01:57.628
Hey, Frank...

01:57.880 --> 01:59.108
take a look at this.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.662
These four points
converge to from a pitchfork.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.302
Does that seem familiar to you ?

02:05.950 --> 02:07.113
Mala Noche.

02:07.643 --> 02:09.357
So they've made their way to the beach.

02:09.652 --> 02:10.765
Who's the lady ?

02:11.637 --> 02:14.794
License ID'd her as,
uh, Claire Trinner.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.297
Nice business dress,

02:16.422 --> 02:17.707
probably on her break,

02:17.825 --> 02:19.117
got caught in the crossfire.

02:19.243 --> 02:22.094
That's what happens
when worlds collide.

03:17.899 --> 03:19.987
Hell of a place for a gang shooting.

03:20.811 --> 03:24.055
We found two casings out by the curb.
They're both .223s.

03:24.181 --> 03:25.711
That's an assault rifle, isn't it ?

03:25.837 --> 03:27.622
And a Noche caliber.

03:27.953 --> 03:30.300
The music was loud enough so
they didn't hear the gunfire,

03:30.425 --> 03:32.207
but they did hear the tires squeal.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.385
Seems consistent with a drive-by.

03:35.104 --> 03:36.979
The rest of it isn't.
There were only two shots,

03:37.104 --> 03:38.240
precision-fired.

03:38.930 --> 03:41.211
You know gang shootings.
They usually spray multiple bullets.

03:41.337 --> 03:43.201
So Jose was targeted.

03:51.915 --> 03:53.885
I'll get the bullets ASAP.

03:54.028 --> 03:55.353
See if that'll help.

03:56.341 --> 03:57.291
I appreciate it.

04:09.490 --> 04:10.521
Marisol.

04:12.003 --> 04:12.875
Hey.

04:13.001 --> 04:15.101
They said I might find you here.

04:16.218 --> 04:19.075
I, um, I was just hoping to
talk to you for a second.

04:19.201 --> 04:20.744
Sure. What's going on ?

04:22.531 --> 04:24.419
I had a wonderful time last night.

04:25.901 --> 04:27.014
So did I.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.285
I'm just worried about you.

04:31.411 --> 04:32.665
Me ? Why ?

04:33.242 --> 04:35.201
You made my arrest go away.

04:35.631 --> 04:36.584
I'm just,

04:36.711 --> 04:40.084
I'm afraid that somebody could twist that,
turn it into something ugly.

04:42.030 --> 04:45.513
First of all, I don't want you
to worry about that, all right ?

04:46.255 --> 04:47.580
And, uh,

04:47.993 --> 04:50.504
Marisol, what's bothering you ?

04:51.715 --> 04:53.268
It's my brother. Eric.

04:53.394 --> 04:57.700
I don't want to do anything to
interrupt, disrupt what you guys have.

04:57.937 --> 04:59.184
I mean, you're his boss.

04:59.310 --> 05:00.610
Okay, um,

05:01.310 --> 05:03.308
how about if I talk to Eric ?

05:04.113 --> 05:05.143
You would do that ?

05:05.745 --> 05:07.099
Of course I would.

05:09.872 --> 05:11.830
Okay then.

05:13.253 --> 05:14.713
I guess I, uh,
I have to go back to work.

05:14.839 --> 05:17.584
Okay. Uh...

05:17.986 --> 05:19.182
- Okay.
- All right.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.317
We'll, uh...

05:21.829 --> 05:23.117
We'll talk later.

05:23.646 --> 05:25.205
- All right.
- Till then.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.126
Take a look at this, Horatio.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.660
Some kind of white residue.

05:39.786 --> 05:43.210
Now, these two were in close proximity,
so he may have smeared it on her.

05:43.336 --> 05:45.030
Okay, let's get that to Trace.

05:45.156 --> 05:46.295
There's one more thing.

05:49.702 --> 05:51.105
His Noche tat.

05:51.587 --> 05:56.326
Now, some of this is red ink,
and some of it's blood.

05:56.885 --> 05:59.634
But it takes a couple of days
for a tattoo to set.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.856
That notch makes ten, Alexx.

06:12.982 --> 06:14.927
And the red ink
means he got a promotion.

06:15.053 --> 06:17.250
Red ink's more than a promotion.

06:17.799 --> 06:20.231
This man got made.
Hang on a second.

06:20.770 --> 06:23.974
Eric, I want to find out who does
the tattoo work for the Mala Noche.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.508
Take Frank with you.

06:26.390 --> 06:27.276
Thank you, Alexx.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.604
Hold that right there.

06:43.730 --> 06:44.697
Be right back.

06:48.666 --> 06:51.521
I hear you do the ink
for all the Noches in Miami.

06:51.791 --> 06:53.526
Yeah, I do ink
for a lot of people.

06:53.873 --> 06:54.900
What, you looking for a tat ?

06:55.026 --> 06:56.530
Do I look like I want one ?

06:56.897 --> 06:58.093
We're here for info.

06:58.239 --> 06:59.991
You're in the wrong place, brother.

07:00.334 --> 07:03.263
Well, I'm gonna tell you something, brother.
Your pal Jose Sambrano's dead.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.013
He was a useless punk.

07:05.139 --> 07:06.908
Good at B&Es,
but he's better at getting caught.

07:07.034 --> 07:09.020
Yeah, you tatted him up
a few days ago.

07:09.377 --> 07:11.069
Yeah, I know skin, not names.

07:11.195 --> 07:13.066
Then you better recognize this.

07:15.807 --> 07:17.109
Yeah, he was here last week.

07:20.193 --> 07:22.589
I just got made.
That's number ten, bro.

07:22.715 --> 07:24.435
So you're one of
the big men now, brother.

07:24.561 --> 07:25.806
Much congrats.

07:25.932 --> 07:27.287
This one's on the house.

07:33.624 --> 07:34.594
Who wants him dead ?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.624
I don't know. I do tats.

07:37.694 --> 07:39.473
Try to stay out of people's business.

07:52.165 --> 07:53.823
Who's in the picture with Jose ?

07:55.906 --> 07:57.620
Whose arm is that next to him ?

08:00.819 --> 08:02.275
I had to try, right ?

08:03.363 --> 08:04.675
I'm gonna keep it anyway.

08:04.811 --> 08:06.791
If that means you're leaving,
be my guest.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.277
I got to get back to work.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.107
Work ?

08:19.881 --> 08:20.831
How'd we do ?

08:21.199 --> 08:23.585
I'm taking a look at the bullets
that Alexx pulled out of the body.

08:23.711 --> 08:24.975
The striations are odd.

08:25.101 --> 08:25.937
Odd how ?

08:26.063 --> 08:29.151
Well, the .223 has a twist, six right.

08:29.447 --> 08:32.341
But the bullet was grooved
in addition to the striation,

08:32.467 --> 08:35.144
so something definitely acted
upon it after it left the barrel.

08:35.270 --> 08:37.030
Somebody used a silencer,
didn't they ?

08:37.155 --> 08:38.363
That's what I'm thinking.

08:38.489 --> 08:42.080
A silencer would leave its own striae,
independent of a firearm.

08:49.988 --> 08:53.181
People toss firearms,
but they keep silencers, don't they ?

08:53.307 --> 08:54.963
They're more expensive
and harder to get.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.203
I'm gonna run the information through IBIS
and see if maybe it was used on another gun.

08:59.329 --> 09:02.315
If we can find the silencer,
Calleigh, we find the killer.

09:07.248 --> 09:10.269
Aaron, you get results on the trace
that Alexx sent you ?

09:10.795 --> 09:13.199
Stuff off the woman's leg ? No.

09:13.330 --> 09:15.395
No ? What's the problem.
Is the Mass Spec busted ?

09:15.521 --> 09:18.031
Just 'cause I didn't get the results
doesn't mean I didn't run it.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.121
It doesn't exist.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.606
It's not in our library ?

09:21.732 --> 09:23.209
Or the FBI's.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.704
It's like we've discovered
a whole new mountain range.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.101
A brand-new drug.

09:27.227 --> 09:30.466
Well, if that's the case, we better figure
out what it is before it hits the streets.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.390
You think you can sketch
the compound based on the spectra ?

09:34.178 --> 09:35.451
It's like a blueprint.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.448
I convert each peak
into its functional group

09:38.574 --> 09:41.172
and determine the chemical
structure of the compound.

09:41.298 --> 09:43.608
It's been a while since
organic chemistry, but...

09:44.308 --> 09:45.888
- I'll give it a shot.
- Okay.

09:46.314 --> 09:47.518
Good luck with that.

09:47.661 --> 09:48.611
Yeah.

09:51.418 --> 09:53.717
You obviously want
the guy we can't see.

09:53.954 --> 09:56.195
So obvious,
I don't even have to answer.

09:57.966 --> 09:58.916
Okay...

09:59.328 --> 10:00.488
let's lose Jose.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.520
I hope we find something. We only
started logging tats a year ago.

10:10.730 --> 10:14.102
Oh, that's more than enough time for
a lot of these guys to make the cut.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.983
"Carlos Mojena."

10:23.473 --> 10:24.827
So Jose's dead.

10:25.156 --> 10:27.408
Come on, Carlos.
You knew that already.

10:27.704 --> 10:29.263
Eh, I heard about it.

10:29.389 --> 10:30.672
Some drive-by.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.039
That's what you
wanted us to think, Carlos.

10:34.098 --> 10:35.469
I don't want anything.

10:35.648 --> 10:37.702
But you know what ? We do.

10:37.828 --> 10:38.823
We know the Noche ranks.

10:38.949 --> 10:40.801
Jose was made.
He should have been safe.

10:41.614 --> 10:42.980
His tattoo told you that.

10:43.106 --> 10:44.806
Why don't you tell me, Carlos ?

10:44.932 --> 10:46.720
Why aren't you talking
to the rival gangs ?

10:46.846 --> 10:48.816
Because we like you for this.

10:49.628 --> 10:52.520
You wanted it to look like a drive-by,
but the car was parked.

10:52.646 --> 10:55.808
So you picked up a silencer,
you chose a target,

10:55.934 --> 10:58.721
and an innocent woman
got shot in the crossfire, right ?

11:01.271 --> 11:03.382
Maybe she was the target, huh ?

11:16.966 --> 11:18.772
I'm not saying nothing.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.768
Get him out of here.

11:29.709 --> 11:30.608
What next ?

11:30.954 --> 11:33.774
We figure out the relationship
between Claire Trinner

11:33.904 --> 11:35.210
and the Noche,

11:35.679 --> 11:37.560
and we've got our killer.

12:02.743 --> 12:03.498
Excuse me.

12:03.624 --> 12:06.445
Someone did not take
the on-line harassment seminar.

12:06.571 --> 12:08.529
Is that how you feel, harassed ?

12:09.224 --> 12:10.302
Maybe.

12:11.725 --> 12:13.096
You wish.

12:13.427 --> 12:14.487
What are you doing ?

12:14.613 --> 12:15.931
I'm working.

12:16.057 --> 12:17.199
Looking for the Callahan case.

12:17.325 --> 12:19.102
I've got to rerun
some DNA evidence.

12:19.228 --> 12:20.756
Okay. Let me help.

12:23.024 --> 12:25.194
So, you really like
that stuff, huh ?

12:25.408 --> 12:26.545
What stuff ?

12:27.263 --> 12:29.175
That green stuff.

12:30.681 --> 12:31.853
Midori ?

12:32.184 --> 12:34.277
Yeah. I drink it.

12:34.403 --> 12:35.353
I drink it.

12:35.495 --> 12:36.344
Whatever.

12:36.470 --> 12:37.988
Well, I picked up
a bottle for you.

12:38.114 --> 12:42.290
I put it on my shelf,
way in the back.

12:43.854 --> 12:45.120
I found it.

12:45.956 --> 12:46.952
Stop it.

12:47.154 --> 12:48.104
Hey, Eric.

12:48.915 --> 12:49.407
Hey.

12:49.407 --> 12:50.357
Hey.

12:50.746 --> 12:51.777
Hi, Natalia.

12:52.061 --> 12:53.649
Hi. Thank you.

12:53.775 --> 12:55.458
- I just wanted to update...
- You're welcome.

12:55.584 --> 12:58.117
- Big help.
- Yeah.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.179
Never mind.

13:04.046 --> 13:05.207
See you later.

13:11.719 --> 13:12.680
So...

13:13.774 --> 13:14.775
I failed Organic.

13:14.901 --> 13:15.855
What the hell is this ?

13:15.981 --> 13:17.482
Tell you what it isn't :

13:17.731 --> 13:18.844
a street drug.

13:19.621 --> 13:21.902
It's a derivative
of atorvastatin calcium.

13:22.028 --> 13:24.783
Which is an analgesic
used in pain medications.

13:25.145 --> 13:26.569
So all that work,
and it didn't help ?

13:26.695 --> 13:29.151
No, it, uh,
puts things in perspective.

13:29.395 --> 13:30.197
Meaning ?

13:30.323 --> 13:31.946
Homicide ran our victim,
Claire Trinner.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.602
She worked at a company
called Cantor Pharmaceutical.

13:34.728 --> 13:36.692
She was the, uh, head of PR.

13:36.818 --> 13:40.966
That helps explain where the sample
came from, but not what it is.

13:41.092 --> 13:44.184
Then it's time to figure it out,
and why it's worth killing over.

13:53.141 --> 13:55.418
Here's the cost analysis for Alyssa.

13:55.544 --> 13:56.517
Thanks, Andrew.

13:56.848 --> 13:58.048
When can we see Alyssa ?

13:58.174 --> 13:59.410
She's still in her meeting.

13:59.536 --> 14:00.878
You sure I can't get you anything ?

14:01.004 --> 14:01.954
Water ?

14:02.307 --> 14:03.743
No, we're fine. Thank you.

14:03.869 --> 14:06.570
No, actually,
I'd-I'd like a water, please.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.340
Thank you.

14:12.631 --> 14:15.210
That Sally, she is something, huh ?

14:17.866 --> 14:19.085
What do you guys do ?

14:19.451 --> 14:20.981
We're just here to talk to your boss.

14:21.107 --> 14:24.474
Well, I-I guess she's
technically my boss.

14:26.024 --> 14:27.466
You guys from Iten Drugs ?

14:27.668 --> 14:28.864
We're from the county.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.623
The county ? Wow.

14:32.060 --> 14:33.325
Trouble brewing ?

14:33.750 --> 14:34.875
Sally, could you...

14:36.469 --> 14:38.563
Alyssa Prince.
You're with the crime lab.

14:38.689 --> 14:41.152
Yeah. Eric Delko.
This is Ryan Wolfe.

14:41.307 --> 14:42.690
Hi. Please.

14:43.444 --> 14:45.896
- Tell Sally no interruptions, okay ?
- Of course, Miss Prince.

14:52.419 --> 14:53.685
Nice.

14:54.415 --> 14:57.055
Well, a CEO's office
really is her home.

14:58.246 --> 15:02.008
Do you have any leads
on what happened to Claire ?

15:02.134 --> 15:03.964
The news is saying
it's gang-related.

15:04.201 --> 15:05.361
Where were you this morning ?

15:07.155 --> 15:08.918
I know you have to ask that,
so I'll dignify it.

15:09.044 --> 15:10.321
I was on a teleconference

15:10.447 --> 15:11.769
with Europe all morning.

15:12.802 --> 15:14.876
Claire had traces of
this substance on her.

15:15.002 --> 15:16.331
It appears to be a...

15:16.876 --> 15:20.000
analgesic, but there's no substances
that match in our database.

15:20.901 --> 15:22.244
It's called Xorax.

15:22.370 --> 15:24.826
It'll take care of everything
from a toothache to a migraine,

15:24.952 --> 15:26.248
and all over the counter.

15:26.374 --> 15:27.421
Is it on the market yet ?

15:27.700 --> 15:29.350
We're awaiting FDA approval today.

15:29.704 --> 15:31.209
Once we get it,

15:31.489 --> 15:32.115
look out.

15:32.674 --> 15:34.526
Did Claire have occasion
to handle the drug ?

15:35.680 --> 15:36.297
No.

15:37.374 --> 15:38.896
Then why did she have it on her ?

15:40.067 --> 15:41.600
I have no idea.

15:43.134 --> 15:44.490
So, who does handle the drug ?

15:45.310 --> 15:46.757
Our head of research,

15:46.883 --> 15:48.286
Paul Burton.

15:58.935 --> 16:00.158
You're the chemist.

16:00.284 --> 16:01.630
This is about Claire, huh ?

16:02.177 --> 16:03.849
She sure picked a bad day to die.

16:04.660 --> 16:07.084
She didn't exactly pick the day, Mr. Burton.

16:07.682 --> 16:08.549
You know what I mean.

16:08.782 --> 16:09.382
No,

16:09.732 --> 16:10.664
I don't think I do.

16:11.572 --> 16:14.789
Now, the drug that's awaiting FDA approval,
how'd it end up on Claire's thigh ?

16:16.576 --> 16:17.428
I don't know.

16:18.564 --> 16:19.387
We...

16:19.513 --> 16:22.835
we checked with security, Paul, and they
said you got back late from lunch.

16:24.194 --> 16:25.184
Where were you ?

16:27.862 --> 16:29.573
Claire was teaching me how to dance.

16:30.162 --> 16:31.061
Dance ?

16:31.216 --> 16:33.626
You might be surprised to know
that I have a girlfriend who...

16:33.752 --> 16:35.077
loves to dance.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.853
And me, I've got two left feet.

16:37.273 --> 16:40.323
Claire's been using her lunch breaks
to teach me. We go to a local studio.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.600
Uh, place your hand here.

16:43.803 --> 16:44.471
Like this ?

16:44.597 --> 16:45.197
Perfect.

16:45.253 --> 16:46.574
That's called the llevada.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.200
Now you're going to carry me
back across the floor.

16:50.004 --> 16:51.441
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

16:52.022 --> 16:53.975
There's only one problem with that,
Mr. Burton.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.600
Yeah ? What ?

16:55.863 --> 16:58.667
You use gloves to handle
the drugs at all times.

16:59.292 --> 17:01.346
There's no way it would've
been on your fingers.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.521
I've been sneaking Xorax, okay ?

17:09.252 --> 17:11.333
To relieve my muscle pain
from the dancing.

17:16.729 --> 17:17.479
Okay.

17:19.045 --> 17:21.409
For a guy who claims
he has nothing to hide,

17:22.603 --> 17:24.073
you sure do seem guilty.

17:25.438 --> 17:26.675
Yeah, well, I'm not,

17:26.965 --> 17:28.305
no matter what that stupid blog says.

17:28.431 --> 17:29.862
I was just learning how to dance.

17:30.163 --> 17:30.763
Blog ?

17:31.273 --> 17:32.655
Blog ? What blog ?

17:32.786 --> 17:34.651
That's why you came
down here, isn't it ?

17:36.910 --> 17:38.801
It's a company blog.

17:39.274 --> 17:41.779
I don't know who writes it,
but they get all their facts wrong.

17:41.905 --> 17:43.559
Why don't you give us the link ?

17:43.783 --> 17:45.431
Maybe they got something right.

17:50.475 --> 17:51.186
Here...

17:51.312 --> 17:53.635
but it's just gossip in print.

17:54.787 --> 17:56.504
All right, these are from today.

17:56.630 --> 17:57.767
Igor...

17:58.033 --> 17:58.817
Inga,

17:58.943 --> 18:00.071
Pablo...

18:00.953 --> 18:02.677
I guess the nicknames
she's keeping from getting fired.

18:02.803 --> 18:04.814
Yeah, well,
they don't help us much.

18:05.641 --> 18:06.940
Take a look at the next entry.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.393
Everything you never wanted to know
about the people you work with.

18:12.452 --> 18:15.006
Every entry has motive. We just got
to figure out who's who.

18:18.570 --> 18:19.269
I wonder

18:19.395 --> 18:21.316
what a blog about this place would say.

18:23.093 --> 18:24.515
You and Boavista ?

18:26.133 --> 18:28.001
You're crazy, man.
Come on.

18:28.264 --> 18:29.433
I saw you guys.

18:29.855 --> 18:30.913
We weren't doing anything.

18:31.039 --> 18:32.153
Oh, okay.

18:32.714 --> 18:34.140
I'm actually glad I saw you guys.

18:34.467 --> 18:35.210
Yeah ? Why ?

18:35.941 --> 18:37.052
I was...

18:39.013 --> 18:40.281
thinking of asking her out.

18:43.637 --> 18:44.427
You ?

18:44.553 --> 18:47.141
She came by my crime scene
a couple weeks ago.

18:47.864 --> 18:49.218
I thought she might be interested.

18:49.344 --> 18:51.967
No. She was probably
just looking for me.

18:52.114 --> 18:54.247
No, you know what ?
It's actually probably better this way.

18:54.373 --> 18:55.910
- Yeah ? Why is that ?
- Well,

18:56.624 --> 18:58.842
office relationships

18:59.044 --> 19:00.369
usually

19:00.772 --> 19:02.198
end badly.

19:04.024 --> 19:05.956
All right, there's one more entry.
Take a look.

19:06.801 --> 19:08.028
"The Hardy Boys."

19:08.154 --> 19:09.932
they must be talking about us.

19:10.092 --> 19:11.047
"They're clueless,

19:11.173 --> 19:13.168
but the girls in the office

19:13.518 --> 19:15.668
are psyched. One of them
looks like A-Rod."

19:16.810 --> 19:18.309
A-Rod. I get that all the time.

19:18.435 --> 19:20.519
- Really ? You don't get Ricky Martin ?
- No.

19:21.821 --> 19:23.101
I don't.

19:24.314 --> 19:25.500
"The other one looks like,

19:25.744 --> 19:26.434
Jake

19:27.340 --> 19:28.216
Guy-len-hall."

19:28.522 --> 19:31.268
Actually, uh,
it's "Gyllenhaal."

19:31.692 --> 19:33.386
Yeah. He's a movie star or something.

19:34.035 --> 19:36.498
Okay, so that's why you wear
your movie star jackets ?

19:36.624 --> 19:37.949
Actually, it's-it's in the eyes.

19:38.075 --> 19:39.574
I get it all the time, A-Rod.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.467
You get it in the eyes all the time ?

19:43.230 --> 19:43.887
All right, well,

19:44.013 --> 19:46.172
whoever's blogging
is doing this from their desk.

19:48.194 --> 19:50.026
How do you think it
relates to the Noches ?

19:50.712 --> 19:52.330
For all we know,
they could be Pablo.

20:03.950 --> 20:04.930
We get a hit ?

20:06.201 --> 20:07.328
You bet.

20:07.867 --> 20:10.441
Sometimes, a liability
becomes an asset.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.108
The groove.

20:12.234 --> 20:14.474
Bullet from an earlier
crime definitely passed

20:14.600 --> 20:16.441
through the same silencer.

20:16.567 --> 20:17.741
Crime happened two days ago.

20:17.867 --> 20:19.941
It was an armed robbery
of a little botanica

20:20.067 --> 20:21.441
down by the Roads.

20:21.567 --> 20:24.241
Suspect's name is,
uh, Mario Pilar.

20:24.367 --> 20:25.975
Where is Mario right now ?

20:26.101 --> 20:28.642
He's waiting for prelim.
He didn't make a statement.

20:28.768 --> 20:29.929
Break his silence, Calleigh.

20:30.055 --> 20:30.914
I'm on it.

20:31.811 --> 20:33.328
I got a bullet from a murder today

20:33.454 --> 20:35.592
that matches the silencer
used in the robbery

20:35.718 --> 20:37.489
you were picked up on two days ago.

20:38.307 --> 20:39.400
That botanica ?

20:40.986 --> 20:41.705
Please believe me,

20:41.831 --> 20:42.703
I'm innocent.

20:43.115 --> 20:45.082
Mario, you've been charged
with armed robbery.

20:45.208 --> 20:48.393
You had gunshot residue on your hands
when they arrested you outside the store.

20:48.969 --> 20:51.101
I was set up by the Mala Noches.

20:51.512 --> 20:53.268
I keep trying to tell you guys that.

20:53.664 --> 20:55.235
I just moved here from Panama.

20:55.651 --> 20:57.391
I got work right away in nice houses.

20:57.732 --> 20:59.201
What were you doing at the store ?

20:59.554 --> 21:01.134
Buying breakfast.

21:01.731 --> 21:03.092
I was on my way to work.

21:03.616 --> 21:05.729
You just happen to be
outside the botanica

21:05.855 --> 21:07.244
when the Mala Noches robbed it ?

21:07.513 --> 21:09.300
I stand there every morning,

21:09.684 --> 21:10.734
drinking my coffee.

21:11.643 --> 21:12.574
They ran out,

21:12.700 --> 21:14.104
and someone threw the gun at me.

21:14.304 --> 21:15.755
I just picked it up.

21:17.685 --> 21:19.198
I didn't even hear a shot.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.788
When they handed you the gun,
was there a silencer on it ?

21:24.937 --> 21:26.201
I don't know what that is.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.324
The gun looked regular.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.667
I tossed it in the trash.

21:32.328 --> 21:33.600
The police tied it to me.

21:35.542 --> 21:36.934
You said nice houses.

21:40.522 --> 21:41.408
I landscape.

21:43.078 --> 21:45.973
I need you to write down the addresses
of those houses for me.

21:48.798 --> 21:50.600
If you don't, I can't help you.

22:07.097 --> 22:08.667
Heard you talked to our boy.

22:09.031 --> 22:11.024
He's obviously terrified
of the Mala Noches,

22:11.150 --> 22:12.030
but he did help us.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.788
Nice addresses.

22:14.914 --> 22:16.658
He landscapes in The Gables,

22:16.784 --> 22:18.534
Hibiscus Island, Miramar.

22:18.660 --> 22:20.564
So this is where
they're hiding their weapons.

22:20.690 --> 22:22.264
Yeah, when there's
too much police presence

22:22.390 --> 22:23.641
in their territory, they go upscale.

22:23.767 --> 22:25.734
Hang on a second.
This Hibiscus address.

22:27.420 --> 22:29.100
That's Claire Trinner's.

22:29.938 --> 22:30.627
Our victim ?

22:30.753 --> 22:32.357
Worlds collide.

22:44.375 --> 22:46.023
Mr. Trinner.

22:46.861 --> 22:48.517
You want to come out of there, please ?

22:50.654 --> 22:52.018
I know this doesn't look good.

22:52.613 --> 22:55.588
Well, this is as bad far
from good as anything could look.

22:55.813 --> 22:58.684
I got the news
about Claire this morning.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.642
I'm devastated.

23:00.768 --> 23:02.147
I can see your grief.

23:03.763 --> 23:04.728
Who's the young lady ?

23:05.492 --> 23:06.994
Cindy lives next door.

23:07.296 --> 23:08.711
She saw it on the news.

23:09.101 --> 23:10.801
Came over to check on me.

23:11.622 --> 23:12.705
I love my wife.

23:13.496 --> 23:16.085
What do you think we'll find when
we take a look in your pool house ?

23:16.454 --> 23:17.082
What ?

23:17.594 --> 23:18.806
I don't know. What do you think
you'll find ?

23:18.932 --> 23:19.906
I don't know.

23:20.123 --> 23:21.904
Maybe you let a gang
keep an arsenal in it.

23:23.216 --> 23:23.989
Why would I do that ?

23:24.115 --> 23:25.394
So they could kill your wife.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.570
You could swim with Cindy
every other afternoon.

23:28.957 --> 23:30.968
Does that sound
like an accurate description ?

23:31.765 --> 23:33.001
You won't find anything.

23:33.641 --> 23:35.855
I never made a deal
with anyone to kill my wife.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.637
But you are banging
the neighbor lady.

23:38.148 --> 23:39.641
We call that motive.

23:39.767 --> 23:41.300
Yes, we do.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.467
- Horatio.
- Wolfe.

23:57.645 --> 23:58.890
Heard you picked up
Claire Trinner's husband.

23:59.016 --> 24:01.137
No weapons found,
but he's definitely a suspect.

24:01.263 --> 24:02.531
The company blog.

24:02.729 --> 24:04.542
Found no less than four
different people at that company

24:04.668 --> 24:05.799
who are either having affairs

24:05.925 --> 24:08.161
- or getting into some other sort of trouble.
- Who are they ?

24:08.287 --> 24:10.182
That's the problem.
Everyone's name is in code.

24:10.308 --> 24:12.127
Break the code,
Mr. Wolfe. Break it.

24:12.253 --> 24:13.184
Will do.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.839
You guys just can't get
enough of me today, can you ?

24:19.965 --> 24:21.304
Don't let it go to your head.

24:21.570 --> 24:22.769
This head ?
No, never.

24:23.805 --> 24:24.581
So, okay...

24:24.741 --> 24:26.026
time to find your blogger.

24:26.152 --> 24:28.985
Can you do that ? I thought
all the information provided was false.

24:29.110 --> 24:31.067
It was. As far as the blogger knew.

24:31.260 --> 24:33.926
But the one detail that has to be
legit to start a blog

24:34.052 --> 24:35.448
is the email address.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.332
Okay, great.
Let's look at that.

24:37.882 --> 24:38.895
Not so simple.

24:39.183 --> 24:41.208
First, I have to
track it back to its server.

24:41.334 --> 24:43.088
I do that by using the base address.

24:43.214 --> 24:44.908
Which is blogdaze.com.

24:45.034 --> 24:45.922
Exactly.

24:46.404 --> 24:47.831
And we know by reading,

24:47.957 --> 24:50.043
that entries were made at

24:50.169 --> 24:51.392
8:04,

24:51.518 --> 24:54.134
9:56 and 12:20.

24:54.412 --> 24:56.052
So I just type in these entries.

25:00.804 --> 25:02.550
And that's the IP address, right ?

25:02.676 --> 25:04.183
You're catching on.
That's cute.

25:04.485 --> 25:07.346
So, we just convert that
to its attendant email and...

25:09.305 --> 25:10.768
Well, I'll be.

25:11.731 --> 25:13.322
It's the perky assistant.

25:14.039 --> 25:15.016
Hey, guys.

25:16.650 --> 25:17.842
Is there a problem ?

25:17.968 --> 25:20.900
Well, if we tell you,
how soon does it end up on your blog ?

25:21.919 --> 25:22.519
What ?

25:22.811 --> 25:24.164
Drop the act, Sally.

25:25.561 --> 25:28.379
We know you're the beginning
and end of information around here.

25:28.654 --> 25:29.706
You can check my computer.

25:29.832 --> 25:30.855
I'm not doing anything.

25:31.038 --> 25:33.320
That's because company policy
states you can't use their

25:33.446 --> 25:35.151
computers to write a blog.

25:35.468 --> 25:37.483
And I follow company policy

25:37.763 --> 25:38.711
to a T.

25:39.088 --> 25:39.800
Yeah, right.

25:39.944 --> 25:41.074
Do me a favor.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.324
Just move back for a second, please.

25:45.601 --> 25:46.723
Thank you.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.520
At least you wrote nice stuff about us.

25:52.252 --> 25:53.215
Right, A-Rod ?

25:54.048 --> 25:56.007
This is very sneaky, Sally.

26:01.212 --> 26:02.488
What the hell is that ?

26:02.929 --> 26:04.407
It's a virtual keyboard.

26:05.101 --> 26:08.339
Bluetooth this to your PDA and you can
use it like a regular keyboard.

26:08.955 --> 26:09.906
How does it work ?

26:10.032 --> 26:13.293
Two lasers are projected.
One creates the keypad and

26:13.600 --> 26:16.831
the other one can tell which letters you're
hitting once you break the horizontal plane.

26:33.029 --> 26:33.754
Okay.

26:34.237 --> 26:36.075
So I have a blog.
What's that prove ?

26:36.201 --> 26:38.413
We'll see when you decipher
those names for us.

26:40.113 --> 26:40.796
Fine.

26:41.215 --> 26:43.078
How often are these desks cleaned ?

26:43.204 --> 26:44.050
Every day.

26:44.176 --> 26:45.125
Why ?

26:45.528 --> 26:47.508
Just means that your prints are fresh.

26:47.634 --> 26:49.521
You'll be able to lift
prints from that mess ?

26:50.870 --> 26:51.548
Sometimes

26:51.971 --> 26:54.534
the prints themselves aren't
as important as where they're found.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.200
But I just told you I'll decode it.

26:57.326 --> 27:00.401
That doesn't mean you're not
still hiding something.

27:05.956 --> 27:07.159
So what now ?

27:07.285 --> 27:09.320
We're looking for hidden motives.

27:10.028 --> 27:10.724
Okay.

27:12.531 --> 27:14.967
The more a key got hit,
the darker green it appears.

27:15.093 --> 27:15.693
So,

27:15.814 --> 27:18.383
we got the usual suspects--
the 'e', the 's', the 't'.

27:18.869 --> 27:20.645
Yeah, but there's a bunch on 'x'.

27:20.771 --> 27:21.371
True.

27:21.953 --> 27:22.767
So ?

27:22.893 --> 27:25.633
So, look at the most recent blogs.
You see any 'x's ?

27:29.449 --> 27:31.172
Maybe she sent a message
to someone else.

27:31.664 --> 27:33.791
No, I don't think so.
Look at the last sentence.

27:36.241 --> 27:38.401
"Stay tuned for
this week's highlights."

27:38.765 --> 27:40.049
Guess that's not gonna happen.

27:40.392 --> 27:41.950
Or it already did.

27:42.134 --> 27:44.396
Bloggers like to hide
messages in the text.

27:44.851 --> 27:47.110
They choose a font the same
color as the background.

27:47.236 --> 27:48.489
You have to highlight it to read it.

27:48.615 --> 27:50.558
And then read between the lines.

27:52.634 --> 27:53.652
Uh-oh.

27:55.645 --> 27:58.018
Looks like Sally
was sharing company secrets.

27:58.144 --> 28:01.124
And there's only one other person that
would have that info before she did.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.607
- The CEO.
- No.

28:02.733 --> 28:04.818
Look at the time of the last blog.

28:06.062 --> 28:07.053
8:04 a.m.

28:07.179 --> 28:09.289
We know she was on a teleconference
call at that time.

28:09.415 --> 28:11.154
So that leaves just one other person.

28:24.839 --> 28:26.129
You need to put on a lab coat.

28:27.002 --> 28:28.283
Oh, no, I don't.

28:29.212 --> 28:30.784
You need to tell me the truth.

28:31.423 --> 28:32.211
About what ?

28:32.337 --> 28:32.967
About

28:33.093 --> 28:34.284
everything.

28:35.153 --> 28:36.384
Let's start with the FDA approval.

28:36.510 --> 28:37.988
You knew this morning
that you didn't get it.

28:38.114 --> 28:39.017
Not true.

28:39.143 --> 28:40.286
You told Sally

28:40.581 --> 28:41.966
and she posted it on her blog.

28:42.961 --> 28:45.158
Look, please don't get her into trouble.
She's just trying to help.

28:45.284 --> 28:47.232
And then you started
dumping your shares...

28:48.275 --> 28:49.388
which I call motive.

28:49.514 --> 28:50.306
For what ?

28:50.482 --> 28:52.059
For wanting Claire dead.

28:52.635 --> 28:54.417
I mean, it's her job
to announce all the findings,

28:54.543 --> 28:55.756
no matter how bad they are.

28:56.133 --> 28:57.580
She is the head of PR.

28:58.369 --> 28:59.784
You can't prove anything.

29:00.921 --> 29:02.451
Well, the SEC can.

29:03.865 --> 29:05.851
And then I'll be back.

29:27.004 --> 29:28.968
So no luck, huh ?

29:29.579 --> 29:31.744
I Ran warrants on all of
Mario's employers.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.240
Most people don't even have
an outside storage area.

29:34.366 --> 29:35.954
The ones that did came up clean.

29:36.566 --> 29:37.698
Do you mind ?

29:40.458 --> 29:43.973
I'm gonna cross-check all the names
against any Florida database--

29:44.098 --> 29:45.958
residential, professional, educational.

29:46.274 --> 29:48.577
If there is a dot,
this'll connect them.

29:51.215 --> 29:54.611
Two of the people he landscaped for
attended the University of Florida.

29:54.737 --> 29:58.474
Another two drove Mercedes,
although that's not too compelling.

30:01.759 --> 30:04.270
Three of them work
for Cantor Pharmaceutical.

30:04.396 --> 30:05.452
What does that mean ?

30:06.145 --> 30:07.514
It means they share their help.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.651
And Mario's holding out on us.

30:14.905 --> 30:15.676
Mario.

30:23.260 --> 30:25.452
You lied to me, didn't you ?

30:27.265 --> 30:27.665
I didn't.

30:27.707 --> 30:32.751
No, I know, Mario, that this is
a high-risk situation for you.

30:33.943 --> 30:36.094
The Noches are everywhere.

30:37.543 --> 30:39.659
Are you going to help me
or not, Mario ?

30:43.271 --> 30:44.757
What do you need to know ?

30:46.238 --> 30:48.896
Someone is missing from your list.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.576
And I need to know who it is

30:50.721 --> 30:51.696
right now.

30:55.789 --> 30:56.996
I will die.

30:57.569 --> 30:58.454
I...

30:58.769 --> 31:00.254
am your last chance.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.258
Miss Prince.

31:18.012 --> 31:20.004
What's going on ? I just
came home to feed my dogs.

31:20.130 --> 31:22.101
Well, your dogs are
going to have to wait.

31:22.810 --> 31:23.864
What's this about ?

31:23.990 --> 31:26.763
I have a warrant to search
your premises, ma'am.

31:26.889 --> 31:28.638
Search my premises ?

31:29.926 --> 31:31.947
For guns, ma'am.
What else did you get ?

31:32.073 --> 31:33.180
Boxes.

31:33.306 --> 31:34.077
Just got to open them up.

31:34.203 --> 31:36.350
Get them to Firearms.
Ms. Prince ?

31:37.083 --> 31:38.459
Would you come with me, please ?

31:43.830 --> 31:47.577
We found an arsenal
in your shed, Ms. Prince-- guns...

31:47.703 --> 31:48.853
ammunition.

31:48.979 --> 31:51.712
I promise you I had no idea
that those were in there.

31:51.837 --> 31:53.312
The gardener shows up
when I'm not home.

31:53.438 --> 31:56.250
I need a list of the names of
the people that come to your house.

31:58.235 --> 32:00.169
I don't know the yard people.

32:00.357 --> 32:01.576
Or the pool man.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.155
Sally takes care of
these things for me.

32:03.281 --> 32:04.658
Sally, your assistant.

32:05.146 --> 32:05.666
Yes.

32:09.426 --> 32:10.804
There was one...

32:12.052 --> 32:14.936
one nice young man,
uh, who used to come.

32:15.062 --> 32:17.900
The young man's name is Mario Pilar.

32:19.086 --> 32:19.956
That's him.

32:22.237 --> 32:23.255
He must have moved on,

32:23.380 --> 32:25.645
but his friends keep showing up and
I figured as long as the work gets done.

32:25.771 --> 32:29.592
You're aware that the Mala
Noche killed Claire Trinner,

32:29.805 --> 32:30.672
aren't you ?

32:33.939 --> 32:35.650
I had nothing to do with that.

32:36.683 --> 32:38.922
So, until you can prove
otherwise, I'll be at the office.

32:39.048 --> 32:42.524
I wouldn't plan
working late, Miss Prince.

32:54.288 --> 32:56.444
This is the arsenal
from Alyssa Prince's house.

32:56.770 --> 32:58.444
Any sign of our murder weapon ?

32:59.033 --> 33:00.556
Chances are it's not here.

33:01.488 --> 33:02.342
But these are.

33:02.468 --> 33:03.557
Silencers.

33:04.848 --> 33:06.057
I found two of them.

33:06.593 --> 33:09.150
I just have to finish unpacking,
see what I'm dealing with.

33:09.566 --> 33:11.638
We can solve a lot of cases with these.

33:11.764 --> 33:14.376
Well, let's slam the door
on this one first.

34:00.749 --> 34:02.039
You hit the jackpot ?

34:02.427 --> 34:03.762
Almost.

34:03.888 --> 34:06.755
This was the silencer
used in the beach killing.

34:10.404 --> 34:11.556
So what's the problem ?

34:11.983 --> 34:14.409
No problem. I feel like
there's something more on it.

34:16.047 --> 34:18.581
Oh, yeah, there's a
thin film of something.

34:19.251 --> 34:20.344
May I ?

34:32.404 --> 34:35.145
Trace from the exterior of
the silencer contained isopropanol

34:35.170 --> 34:36.645
and trimethyl ammonium chloride.

34:36.771 --> 34:37.722
Liquid flux.

34:37.848 --> 34:41.578
Yeah, used in the manufacture of needles
to solder them to needle arms.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.447
You think it was someone
back at Cantor Pharmaceutical ?

34:43.574 --> 34:47.650
I think somebody's using these needles
for something else, Mr. Wolfe.

35:00.792 --> 35:01.992
Nice ride.

35:03.974 --> 35:05.642
Stay right where you are.

35:05.768 --> 35:07.928
A lot of nice artwork here, Hector.

35:08.082 --> 35:10.615
You make your own equipment, don't you ?

35:10.741 --> 35:12.458
Needles, that sort of thing.

35:12.584 --> 35:13.847
Yeah, it cuts down overhead.

35:13.973 --> 35:17.291
Yes, but it has a nasty habit
of implicating you, Hector.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.175
In what ?

35:18.301 --> 35:19.122
In a murder.

35:19.248 --> 35:21.576
You left evidence on the silencer.

35:52.931 --> 35:55.150
Should have never given Jose that tat.

35:56.161 --> 35:57.931
Is that how you got picked
for the job ?

36:03.325 --> 36:04.847
Catch you later, Carlos.

36:04.973 --> 36:05.999
Yeah.

36:07.258 --> 36:08.469
You just gave him his mark ?

36:08.595 --> 36:09.927
Without checking ?

36:10.053 --> 36:12.273
Nobody would ask for one
without earning it, man.

36:12.399 --> 36:13.854
Jose just did.

36:15.128 --> 36:16.235
Make it right.

36:16.361 --> 36:18.759
Go to the shed, and get a piece.

36:19.070 --> 36:20.382
Okay.

36:21.276 --> 36:22.430
I'm sorry, boss.

36:22.556 --> 36:25.102
I need you to take care
of someone else, too.

36:30.507 --> 36:32.853
So, what, Claire was just a bonus ?

36:32.979 --> 36:34.852
Jose thought he was
supposed to kidnap her.

36:35.328 --> 36:37.240
Got them close enough to do the deed.

36:37.366 --> 36:38.156
That's cold.

36:38.772 --> 36:40.151
It was either him or me.

36:40.637 --> 36:41.347
Hector,

36:41.473 --> 36:44.469
I want to know who hired
the Noches to kill Claire.

36:45.364 --> 36:46.452
That I don't know.

36:46.578 --> 36:48.252
Then how'd you know who to kill ?

36:49.198 --> 36:50.463
Got a picture.

36:50.589 --> 36:52.094
Where's the picture now ?

36:53.602 --> 36:54.610
Second drawer.

36:54.736 --> 36:55.821
Check it.

37:07.671 --> 37:09.157
There's trace on it, H.

37:10.805 --> 37:12.287
See ? I'm cooperating.

37:12.413 --> 37:13.363
Yes.

37:13.489 --> 37:14.631
Too little,

37:14.757 --> 37:16.542
too late, Hector.

38:15.238 --> 38:17.252
The picture had Xorax all over it.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.550
Whoever hired the Noches to kill Claire

38:19.675 --> 38:21.959
definitely worked
at Cantor Pharmaceutical.

38:22.070 --> 38:24.416
- Paul Burton just lawyered up.
- The chemist ?

38:24.542 --> 38:26.005
We got him for insider trading.

38:26.131 --> 38:26.636
Okay.

38:26.659 --> 38:29.844
Yeah, I definitely don't think
that he put the hit out on Claire.

38:29.970 --> 38:31.015
Well, who else could it be ?

38:31.140 --> 38:33.845
He's the only one that handled the
drugs, and it was all over the picture.

38:34.041 --> 38:37.235
Someone was handling him.
He mentioned a girlfriend.

38:37.361 --> 38:39.582
And since he spent every
waking moment at the lab...

38:39.708 --> 38:41.146
He must have met her there.

38:41.272 --> 38:44.849
I understand when lovebirds work together,
they steal time whenever they can.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.355
Ryan say something to you ?

38:47.481 --> 38:48.665
About what ?

38:49.060 --> 38:49.795
Never mind.

38:49.921 --> 38:50.980
No, really, what are you talking about ?

38:51.106 --> 38:52.270
Nothing. Forget about it.

38:52.396 --> 38:55.398
I'm gonna go back to that office
and find Burton's girlfriend.

38:55.524 --> 38:56.683
Based on... ?

38:56.809 --> 38:58.156
An educated guess.

39:07.884 --> 39:10.980
This is becoming a real
inconvenience. I've got...

39:11.106 --> 39:13.067
a lot of damage control
to do here at the company.

39:13.193 --> 39:15.673
You've got quite a bit
to do with me, too.

39:15.799 --> 39:16.862
Like what ?

39:16.988 --> 39:20.090
Like why you hired a Mala Noche
member to kill Claire Trinner.

39:20.516 --> 39:21.570
That's absurd.

39:21.796 --> 39:24.101
No, it's not absurd,
Alyssa. It's the truth.

39:24.957 --> 39:28.850
Now we found the guns at your house,
and Hector gave us a picture of Claire.

39:29.116 --> 39:31.109
Why would I want her dead ?

39:31.235 --> 39:33.579
Because you thought she was
sleeping with your boyfriend.

39:34.919 --> 39:36.431
Sally decoded everything.

39:36.557 --> 39:39.298
Paul and Claire were Igor and Inga.

39:39.424 --> 39:40.936
You were Pablo,

39:41.062 --> 39:42.655
as in Escobar,

39:42.781 --> 39:44.764
head of the drug cartel.

39:46.771 --> 39:51.073
The blog made it clear they were
sneaking off together, every day.

39:51.549 --> 39:53.259
The whole office knew.

39:53.385 --> 39:56.355
- And that just burned you up, didn't it ?
- Yes.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.693
Paul and I made a great team.

39:59.940 --> 40:00.932
Claire...

40:01.058 --> 40:02.422
she had no right.

40:02.548 --> 40:05.356
So do as I say, not as I do.

40:06.073 --> 40:07.398
It's my company.

40:07.524 --> 40:08.934
Not for long.

40:11.030 --> 40:12.134
Now,

40:12.362 --> 40:14.957
how did you meet the Mala Noches ?

40:15.088 --> 40:16.380
Through Mario ?

40:17.520 --> 40:20.942
He was clearly scared of them. Then
I saw them putting guns in my shed.

40:21.068 --> 40:23.370
And instead of being frightened,
you turned it around,

40:23.495 --> 40:26.907
- hired them to kill Claire.
- I don't like to lose.

40:28.576 --> 40:31.755
I don't want to know anything about it
except that it's happened and soon.

40:31.881 --> 40:33.120
You got the cash ?

40:37.654 --> 40:38.560
This is her.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.830
Just get it done.

40:39.956 --> 40:41.791
You're one crazy lady.

40:45.149 --> 40:47.457
You know what's sad
about this, Alyssa ?

40:49.938 --> 40:51.299
You were wrong.

40:53.192 --> 40:54.477
About what ?

40:54.603 --> 40:57.553
Claire was teaching Paul
how to dance...

40:57.990 --> 40:59.726
to make you happy.

41:02.236 --> 41:04.643
Obviously, that was a waste of time.

41:24.122 --> 41:25.207
H.

41:26.170 --> 41:27.725
Guess everyone's out
for one of their own today.

41:27.849 --> 41:30.006
- Certainly looks that way, doesn't it ?
- Yeah.

41:30.132 --> 41:30.968
Eric...

41:31.094 --> 41:32.157
I heard.

41:32.749 --> 41:34.831
Marisol made you dinner last night.

41:36.514 --> 41:37.747
She did.

41:38.813 --> 41:39.790
Yeah.

41:40.886 --> 41:45.563
Look, I was a little freaked out
about my boss seeing my sister. But...

41:45.724 --> 41:47.956
seeing how happy she is,
I can't argue with it.

41:48.082 --> 41:49.350
No concerns ?

41:50.897 --> 41:52.466
None for her.

41:53.431 --> 41:56.253
But you need to know that
she's a lot sicker than she looks.

41:57.460 --> 41:59.344
Doctors think, uh...

41:59.966 --> 42:01.140
months.

42:04.082 --> 42:06.025
Can you live with that ?

42:06.287 --> 42:07.648
I can.

42:10.607 --> 42:11.958
All right.

42:12.211 --> 42:13.404
We...

42:14.438 --> 42:16.313
are gonna be all right.
