00:06.330 --> 00:08.548
[theme music playing]

00:32.030 --> 00:34.521
[Hannah] Zach, I wrote you a letter.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.239
I poured my heart out,
opening up about personal things

00:41.750 --> 00:44.116
I hadn't had the courage
to admit to anyone.

00:46.790 --> 00:50.339
How hard life was getting.
How lonely I felt.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.579
[Zach] I keep to myself mostly.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.308
I don't always tell people things.
I'm not good with...

01:00.390 --> 01:01.345
[Mrs. Dempsey] Zach?

01:01.970 --> 01:03.210
...like, drama.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.848
You look good. Very sharp.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.555
You ready for this?

01:10.730 --> 01:12.607
Yeah, I'm all ready. Yeah.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.601
I learned pretty early on
not to rock the boat.

01:15.650 --> 01:17.356
-You'll do great.
-To stay in my lane.

01:17.450 --> 01:21.489
You're a good boy.
The best son a mother could have.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.156
Don't worry, Mom. It'll be fine.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.160
[Sheri] Don't worry about it.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.206
Okay? He'll be back.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.706
He's sick as hell.
He can't go to the city.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.210
He's got no money, no car.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.428
-Clay, I'm on your side, okay?
-[sighs]

01:38.510 --> 01:39.716
We'll figure this out.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.629
Thank you.

01:44.220 --> 01:47.303
-Can-- Can I trust you?
-Always.

01:54.860 --> 01:57.988
Do you have any idea where at school
these might have been taken?

01:59.910 --> 02:02.777
No, I... I don't recognize it.

02:07.580 --> 02:09.662
-Wait, is that...?
-Bryce.

02:13.670 --> 02:14.489
Wow.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.624
Yup.

02:16.710 --> 02:18.086
[Zach] I try not to be a bully.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.499
[woman] Mr. Baker!

02:19.590 --> 02:21.797
-[Zach] I try not to be a victim.
- What do you expect from today?

02:21.890 --> 02:24.882
We firmly believe
that our daughter deserved better

02:24.970 --> 02:27.427
and that the school...
the school could have done more.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.808
We don't let ourselves forget that.
That's how we keep ourselves going.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.767
-We're in this together.
-[woman] Mr. Baker, one more question.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.600
We're in this together.

02:35.690 --> 02:37.271
-[man 1] Thank you, sir.
-[man 2] Thank you.

02:39.530 --> 02:40.690
Olivia, everything okay?

02:41.450 --> 02:43.907
Just hope that dumb kid
tells the truth in there today.

02:43.990 --> 02:45.537
Liv, this time, we have actual proof

02:45.620 --> 02:47.611
that Hannah told the school
that she was hurting.

02:47.700 --> 02:51.158
She wrote that note in class.
They did nothing. We're right on this one.

02:51.670 --> 02:52.910
-It's a win.
-[Jackie] I agree.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.337
And it is so good to see you both here.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.909
Though, ifI may say,

02:57.010 --> 02:58.796
now that we're playing
you're a united front,

02:58.880 --> 03:00.791
it is helpful to hold hands for the press.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.599
We're not... playing at anything.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.841
[Zach] It's a tough line to walk.

03:08.470 --> 03:10.847
[Dennis]
So this bullying that you just mentioned,

03:10.940 --> 03:13.761
do you feel pressure to join in
when you see it happening?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.010
-[Zach] Yes, sir.
-What type of bullying do you see?

03:16.320 --> 03:19.141
Well, sometimes it's obvious
and sometimes it's not.

03:19.940 --> 03:21.942
Sometimes a kid gets roughed up.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.485
A lot of the times, though,

03:25.660 --> 03:28.367
it's just stuff that people say.

03:28.830 --> 03:29.990
Especially athletes.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.288
[Dennis]
So, what type of stuff do you say?

03:36.790 --> 03:42.296
We brag about things
that we do with girls, like...

03:43.550 --> 03:45.632
uh... sexually.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.052
Even when they're not true.
And sometimes that can get around.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.057
[Dennis] And who's saying these things?

03:58.860 --> 03:59.724
Lots of kids.

04:01.740 --> 04:02.855
[Zach] It's a tough school.

04:03.530 --> 04:06.863
Three weeks before you went
to the hospital, you received the tapes.

04:06.950 --> 04:08.235
Do you remember how?

04:08.530 --> 04:09.406
At school?

04:10.540 --> 04:11.780
No, they were mailed to you.

04:13.210 --> 04:16.873
On tape five, Hannah talks about running
into you and Jessica at the winter formal.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.297
Remember what she said about you two?

04:20.840 --> 04:22.046
That we looked good together?

04:23.050 --> 04:26.338
No. You weren't at the dance with Jessica.
You just talked to her there.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.795
Well-- [stutters]

04:28.260 --> 04:31.388
-Did you-- Have you been studying?
-Yes, I've been fucking studying.

04:32.980 --> 04:35.687
Clay, I've listened to the tapes,
like, four times.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.812
I don't even know if the_doctor's
gonna ask me any of this today.

04:38.900 --> 04:39.855
I went online.

04:40.530 --> 04:44.102
Some doctors tested Marines that had TBI
with dates and memory questions

04:44.200 --> 04:45.736
to see if they could continue serving.

04:45.820 --> 04:48.869
I'm not a fucking Marine, Clay.
I shot myself in the head.

04:50.370 --> 04:52.861
Mr. Porter is out this morning.

04:53.410 --> 04:58.450
I'm Ms. Paul, and we're going
to be watching a very interesting ﬁlm.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.167
[gasps] Human Centipede ?

05:00.250 --> 05:01.330
[laughter]

05:01.420 --> 05:04.969
Well, no. It's not a nature film.
[chuckles]

05:05.050 --> 05:05.926
It's, uh...

05:08.010 --> 05:11.343
It's about life after high school,
and how it gets better.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.671
That's great, but what the hell
are we supposed to do until then?

05:17.270 --> 05:18.146
[Ms. Paul chuckles]

05:19.520 --> 05:21.476
I superglued the DVD player shut.

05:21.860 --> 05:24.272
So _now we wait to_ see _
how long It takes her to figure It out.

05:27.740 --> 05:29.310
Dude, come on, celebrate me.

05:31.370 --> 05:32.735
My neighbor saw us shooting.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.248
-So my dad's calling your dad.
-Shit.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.076
But now he wants to take us shooting.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.951
So, wait, we're getting in trouble
for shooting guns,

05:41.040 --> 05:42.917
so they're taking us to go shoot guns?

05:43.380 --> 05:44.449
Essentially, yeah.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.710
[chortles]

05:46.510 --> 05:47.966
Do adults think these things through?

05:48.510 --> 05:51.252
-I know, but--
-No, dude, I'm there.

05:51.430 --> 05:52.886
-Fuck, yeah.
-Yeah, cool.

05:53.470 --> 05:56.348
All right. [chuckles]
Who is good with electronics?

05:59.940 --> 06:01.180
[sighs]

06:05.280 --> 06:08.317
-This silent treatment gonna last all day?
-What do you want me to say, Kev?

06:09.030 --> 06:11.863
I was glad to bail you out of jail
and wait two hours at the impound?

06:12.160 --> 06:17.154
You said that I should use the time
that I have left to do the most good.

06:17.830 --> 06:18.785
Take care of those kids.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.878
And how is assaulting a drug dealer
taking care of those kids?

06:21.960 --> 06:24.997
He all but put a price tag
on Justin Foley's head.

06:25.340 --> 06:27.376
And what happened to the back window, hmm?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.881
[Mr. Porter] It--
It must have happened during the fight.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.347
-I mean, we'll-- we'll get it fixed.
-It's not about the car.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.709
It...

06:36.810 --> 06:40.348
[sighs] Look, I'm proud of you, Kev.

06:41.060 --> 06:44.314
Fighting for these kids,
doing whatever you can, I get it.

06:44.770 --> 06:47.102
But, baby,
there's glass in Mason's car seat.

06:48.610 --> 06:49.895
I want you to do you.

06:50.450 --> 06:53.613
But what if someone from the school
finds out what happened and you get fired?

06:53.700 --> 06:55.110
They won't, all right?

06:55.540 --> 06:58.532
-And what if you get hurt next time?
-There won't be a next time.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.241
I promise. Okay?

07:02.210 --> 07:03.029
[Ryan] So...

07:04.000 --> 07:06.412
I'm obsessed
with this new life you're leading.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.832
But can I ask you
about your old cheerleading days?

07:10.260 --> 07:11.079
Sure.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.176
You ever heard of a place
called The Clubhouse?

07:16.180 --> 07:18.011
It's a place where jocks hung out maybe.

07:19.930 --> 07:21.886
No, it doesn't sound familiar.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.516
Anything else you know about it?

07:24.230 --> 07:27.222
Apparently, Hannah went there
with an athlete, possibly Justin,

07:27.530 --> 07:30.567
-long after they broke up.
-Are you serious, Ryan?

07:31.320 --> 07:32.947
You're really trying to dig up dirt
on Hannah?

07:33.280 --> 07:36.078
No, I wasn't. I'm interested.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.481
Yeah, well, your interest tends
to end up in your zine.

07:39.330 --> 07:41.207
I would never. I... Iwasjust...

07:43.580 --> 07:44.490
You're right.

07:50.920 --> 07:51.909
I'll drop it.

07:55.510 --> 07:57.751
[Zach] It is especially tough on girls.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.260
It was for Hannah.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.638
To your knowledge,
neither Mrs. Bradley nor...

08:05.610 --> 08:09.478
any Liberty faculty took any action
once this anonymous note was read aloud?

08:09.570 --> 08:10.730
Not to my knowledge, no.

08:10.820 --> 08:16.406
So a note expressing interest in suicide
was read aloud in class,

08:16.490 --> 08:19.072
and faculty members ignored it?

08:19.160 --> 08:22.072
'[SOnya] Objection. Asked and answered.
-[judge] Sustained.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.912
[Dennis] No further questions, Your Honor.

08:26.380 --> 08:30.453
Hey, Kevin. How you doing, buddy?
How's that new class going?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.797
-It's all good, thanks.
-Good. Glad to hear it.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.169
Just helps keep your head down
and, you know, focus on work

08:38.260 --> 08:40.672
when things get a little messed up,
you know.

08:42.810 --> 08:43.936
Like last night.

08:44.890 --> 08:45.720
I'm sorry?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.721
I got a buddy I went to high school with,

08:49.820 --> 08:52.732
and, uh, he's one of the lieutenants
at the station there.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.528
-He called me when they brought you in.
-It was a misunderstanding.

08:56.610 --> 08:59.522
[chuckles] You know, look,
we've all been there, you know?

08:59.620 --> 09:02.908
And apparently, they got
that dealer guy there, like, once a week.

09:03.200 --> 09:09.582
But, look, I vouched for you, and he said
that they'd all make it go away.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.968
_ -I see. _
-I'm just gonna keep this between us.

09:30.940 --> 09:34.649
[indistinct chattering]

09:43.540 --> 09:46.202
So, yeah, I spent the entire night
in my own bed,

09:46.290 --> 09:48.167
and my dad only stayed for half of it.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.411
Yeah, I mean, that is everything.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.672
[Jessica] Too easy to get sucked back in
to old shit. I can handle it now.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.722
Hey, what's up?
Uh... Do you know Michael?

10:09.100 --> 10:11.432
-Hi.
-Hey. Michael.

10:11.730 --> 10:15.063
-[Clay] So what did your doctor say, Alex?
-I'm sorry, I tried.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.948
-But they're not gonna let me testify.
-[Clay] Shit.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.026
Did the doctor say why?

10:42.550 --> 10:43.380
Justin.

10:55.110 --> 10:55.929
Hey, Jess.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.276
I missed you.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.443
-Can we go somewhere else to talk, alone?
-No.

11:06.990 --> 11:08.491
I came back for you.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.570
It's the only reason why I'm here.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.299
If you want me to stay,

11:17.550 --> 11:19.461
I promise you I'm here for good.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.836
Look, if you want me to go, I'll go.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.756
Forever, this time.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.750
-You said that before.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.881
I tried to go away.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.260
I tried to forget about you. I...

11:34.940 --> 11:36.896
I tried so fucking hard.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.231
But I can't stop thinking about you.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.099
Yeah, I think about you, too.

11:45.870 --> 11:47.019
And I wish you were dead.

11:53.670 --> 11:54.489
I'm sorry.

11:56.460 --> 11:58.041
I didn't mean to hurt you more.

12:05.510 --> 12:06.340
You.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.016
-Justin!
-[students murmur]

12:12.140 --> 12:13.971
-[Clay] Justin.
-[Tony] Justin, wake up.

12:14.270 --> 12:16.226
-Justin. Justin.
-Wake up. Wake up. Justin.

12:16.650 --> 12:17.469
[Tony] Fuck.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.528
-Yeah, we gotta get him back to my house.
-No, I can't do this anymore.

12:20.610 --> 12:22.350
-Okay? I'm out.
-What do you mean you're out?

12:22.450 --> 12:25.237
-There is no "we," okay?
-What the fuck is up with you?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.077
-We gotta get him out of here.
-Yeah.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.611
Come on, Justin. Use your legs.
Use your legs.

12:51.430 --> 12:52.476
Did you know he was back?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.010
No, no, we really didn't know.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.808
What does it matter to you?
Why do you fucking care if Justin's back?

12:58.900 --> 13:00.219
Because, clearly, you do.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.811
I don't fucking care.
You don't know how I feel.

13:05.860 --> 13:08.693
Yeah, you're right. I don't.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.374
Zach, isn't it true that Hannah
also reached out to you

13:20.460 --> 13:21.415
to talk about her feelings?

13:22.170 --> 13:25.549
-Um, yes.
-And did she write a note to you?

13:26.260 --> 13:28.171
A note that was not anonymous?

13:29.510 --> 13:33.059
Yes. Yeah, she wrote me
a letter explaining...

13:34.060 --> 13:35.846
how sad she felt about everything.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.932
How she felt really alone
a lot of the time.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.769
So you told no one at Liberty High
that Hannah wrote you a note

13:43.860 --> 13:45.942
telling you how alone she felt?

13:50.870 --> 13:52.076
I didn't know how to.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.038
_ But isn't it true
that you did reach out to her off campus?

13:58.210 --> 13:59.029
Um...

13:59.120 --> 14:00.997
The summer after sophomore year.

14:01.210 --> 14:03.792
The summer after the note.
Did you have contact with her?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.289
-Yes.
-And isn't it true

14:07.380 --> 14:09.428
that you saw her more than once
that summer?

14:12.350 --> 14:16.423
[Zach] Um, yeah, last summer was slow.
Most people were out of town.

14:18.810 --> 14:21.108
-You take them, okay?
-Sure thing.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.355
Can I help you?

14:23.730 --> 14:25.982
Hey. Yeah, can I get
a box of Mike and Ikes,

14:26.070 --> 14:29.028
a box of Hot Tamales
and a Diet Coke, please?

14:29.110 --> 14:31.613
No, you cannot have fucking
Mike and Ikes and Hot Tamales

14:31.700 --> 14:33.327
because you're not a fucking child.

14:33.410 --> 14:36.368
-Actua|ly, his mommy says he is.
-Okay. Fuck off, you guys.

14:36.450 --> 14:38.031
Don't you get tired
of the mama's boy jokes?

14:38.120 --> 14:40.361
[Montgomery] Uh, no. No, we don't.

14:40.460 --> 14:41.620
[Scott and Montgomery snicker]

14:47.260 --> 14:48.716
[Zach] So I went to a lot of movies.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.795
What can I get you?

14:54.930 --> 14:55.749
I...

14:57.100 --> 15:00.308
just wanted to say that I am sorry...

15:01.810 --> 15:03.141
for all of it.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.641
The thing I said about your ass,
that wasn't...

15:08.400 --> 15:11.278
And your compliments and, um...

15:13.120 --> 15:14.360
I'm just really...

15:16.080 --> 15:16.899
I'm really sorry.

15:18.910 --> 15:19.820
Thanks.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.162
-You're an asshole, but thanks.
-Yeah.

15:27.550 --> 15:28.369
Mike and Ikes?

15:30.510 --> 15:31.329
Yeah.

15:32.220 --> 15:33.539
And Hot Tamales, too, please.

15:36.140 --> 15:37.380
And-- And a Diet Coke.

15:48.150 --> 15:51.062
[Zach] I mean, I guess I even saw movies
I didn't wanna see.

15:53.950 --> 15:56.271
[scoffs] You see a lot of movies.

15:56.530 --> 16:00.409
Yeah. Well, this 2001 thing
is supposed to be a masterpiece, so...

16:00.500 --> 16:02.070
God, it's, uh... so boring.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.378
-Oh, is it?
-Yeah, but at least it's long.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.706
You should still see it, though,

16:06.790 --> 16:09.668
so at least when pretentious people talk
about it, you can yawn really loudly.

16:10.590 --> 16:12.581
Okay. Cool, yeah.

16:14.590 --> 16:15.420
So...

16:20.270 --> 16:21.225
[clears throat]

16:24.850 --> 16:25.680
Thanks.

16:29.190 --> 16:33.559
[theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey plays]

16:57.890 --> 17:00.131
So, yeah...

17:01.810 --> 17:04.096
-that was painful.
-[laughs]

17:05.270 --> 17:09.104
Right? You're in space.
Why aren't you having fun in space?

17:09.190 --> 17:10.680
Why does nobody talk?

17:10.770 --> 17:14.354
Why is the movie so long
and nobody talks about anything?

17:14.570 --> 17:18.062
I mean, at least talk about the fact
that, holy shit, you're in outer space.

17:19.450 --> 17:20.610
Would you...

17:23.410 --> 17:25.617
ever wanna watch a different movie?

17:26.370 --> 17:28.668
-Like...
-Like with you?

17:28.750 --> 17:32.584
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I meant with me,
as part of the...

17:34.340 --> 17:35.500
the plan.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.798
Except not at my house.
My mom doesn't let me have girls over.

17:39.180 --> 17:42.468
So, you're inviting me
to watch a movie at my house?

17:45.310 --> 17:48.347
I mean, they're never gonna make a movie
about Cameron taking a day off.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.226
[ Ferris Bueller's Day Off
plays indistinctly]

17:50.310 --> 17:53.108
People underestimate
the Camerons of the world.

17:54.820 --> 17:56.731
I mean, they can be surprising.

17:57.910 --> 18:02.574
Everyone thinks when he falls off
the diving board that he wants to drown.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.289
But I think he just wanted someone
to save him.

18:09.540 --> 18:13.124
-I kind of get that, actually.
-Yeah.

18:15.510 --> 18:17.046
-[Olivia] Hannah?
-[door closing]

18:17.130 --> 18:19.633
-Shit. My parents are home early.
-Uh...

18:19.720 --> 18:20.709
Uh...

18:21.470 --> 18:23.711
Uh, just hide. Like...

18:25.470 --> 18:27.301
-[Olivia] Hannah, you up?
-Oh, fuck.

18:30.350 --> 18:32.102
Honey, are you up?

18:47.250 --> 18:48.365
[both chuckle]

18:48.460 --> 18:51.281
[Zach] No. To my knowledge,
her parents never found out.

18:52.330 --> 18:55.959
[Sonya] So you told no one else about
the time you spent with Hannah,

18:56.050 --> 18:58.336
-isn't that correct?
-Yes.

18:58.420 --> 19:00.797
Then isn't it true that you were ashamed
of telling anyone?

19:00.880 --> 19:02.427
No. No, Ijust...

19:08.640 --> 19:09.470
[sighs]

19:10.270 --> 19:13.012
That was the summer that my dad died.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.138
And I was out of my mind,
and I needed someone that I could talk to.

19:18.240 --> 19:22.654
Yes, but, Zach, didn't you send
each other hundreds of text messages?

19:23.240 --> 19:24.116
I...

19:25.580 --> 19:28.447
Hundreds? I mean, I... Yeah, we texted.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.747
-[cell phone beeps]
-[Zach] I don't know how many times.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.320
[Bryce] Who is it, Zachy?

19:33.500 --> 19:34.319
[groans]

19:34.710 --> 19:36.587
No one. It's just my mom.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.047
How's she doing? She okay?

19:47.260 --> 19:48.921
She just needs me to come home.

19:50.730 --> 19:51.845
How are you doing?

19:53.230 --> 19:55.437
I'm good. I'm fine.

19:59.070 --> 20:00.606
I'm not good.

20:01.610 --> 20:02.690
My mom...

20:03.410 --> 20:05.901
My mom doesn't even wanna talk about it.

20:06.490 --> 20:10.938
She's acting like life is just,
like, going on.

20:11.540 --> 20:15.419
And, I mean, I know that she's destroyed,
and she's worried about the future

20:15.500 --> 20:19.163
and everything,
but she doesn't say anything about it.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.251
My parents do the same thing.

20:25.430 --> 20:26.499
[Zach] We just...

20:27.220 --> 20:29.802
We had things in common to talk about,

20:29.890 --> 20:33.474
and things we didn't have to talk about,
things we just knew about each other.

20:34.810 --> 20:37.722
[Sonya] That must've been exhausting,
keeping that a secret.

20:40.230 --> 20:44.849
Yeah, I guess I, uh...
I just wanted to keep the friendship ours.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.909
And in all that time you spent together,
all those texts,

20:48.990 --> 20:51.652
you and Hannah never became
more than friends?

20:52.330 --> 20:54.867
You never told
your fellow teammates about her,

20:54.960 --> 20:56.575
as you've said they do?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.992
-Bragged a bit?
-No. I would never do that.

21:00.460 --> 21:04.044
Because there was nothing to brag about
or because you're not one to do so?

21:04.590 --> 21:07.218
Because it wasn't like that.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.296
What was it like then?

21:11.010 --> 21:14.969
Mr. Dempsey, did something happen
between you and Hannah Baker

21:15.060 --> 21:17.096
the summer before she took her life?

21:31.410 --> 21:32.820
-What? Shut up.
-[chuckles]

21:32.910 --> 21:35.572
After that, we went on Space Mountain,
and I threw up all over her.

21:35.660 --> 21:39.869
And after she broke up with me,
I took a long walk through Toon Town.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.587
[both chuckle]

21:41.670 --> 21:43.877
Yeah. How about you? Any bad breakups?

21:44.970 --> 21:48.212
Kind of hard to be broken up with
when you've never had a boyfriend.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.598
What? Really? I thought you and...

21:52.890 --> 21:55.381
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...

21:55.480 --> 21:58.722
Everyone thinks I've done a lot of things
with a lot of people, but...

22:01.190 --> 22:03.021
Hey, because I'm a guy,
people give me shit

22:03.110 --> 22:04.850
because I don't do enough, so...

22:07.320 --> 22:08.480
And what have you done?

22:09.280 --> 22:12.158
-Are you seriously asking?
-I am.

22:14.450 --> 22:18.034
Uh, yeah, nothing. I'm a virgin.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.006
It's weird.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.879
You know, 'cause of my reputation, like,
people calling me a slut and everything,

22:30.970 --> 22:35.259
it made sex seem bad,
like this negative thing.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.768
But I don't want it to be.
I want my first time to be how I want it,

22:38.850 --> 22:40.590
not how everyone says it's been.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.107
Yeah. I actually get that.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.737
[sighs] Feels like
there's no one good left in this town

22:47.820 --> 22:49.606
to even wanna do that with, though.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.166
So, um...

23:09.380 --> 23:11.041
It's just, I...

23:11.550 --> 23:14.508
It's just you are a good person,
and I like you.

23:15.140 --> 23:16.516
I like you, too.

23:19.270 --> 23:20.476
Sorry, what's happening?

23:23.900 --> 23:26.937
I wanna lose my virginity,
and I want it to be great.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.562
Like I wanna do it on my terms
and with someone that I like.

23:32.740 --> 23:35.527
Would you be interested in having sex?

[stammers]

23:38.660 --> 23:40.901
Oh! Yes!

23:42.330 --> 23:45.629
All right, man, so, who is this girl?

23:46.380 --> 23:49.759
She's, uh... She's from another school.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.539
-[Justin] Cool.
-Yeah.

23:51.760 --> 23:52.829
So what do you wanna know?

23:53.260 --> 23:55.672
Well, what exactly do I need to know?

23:55.970 --> 24:00.134
Well, I'm very happy you came to my office
for this chat to--

24:01.600 --> 24:03.056
No, but, seriously,

24:03.150 --> 24:09.476
it's hotter when a girl likes
what you're doing and she feels good.

["Souvenir" playing]

24:14.700 --> 24:15.985

24:25.330 --> 24:27.787
-begin this...
-[chuckles]

24:28.710 --> 24:31.042
[sighs] ...thing that we're doing.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.719
-Is that me shaking or you?
-Maybe both. A little bit of both.

24:39.810 --> 24:41.425
[chuckles]

24:47.360 --> 24:49.146
It's my direction

24:49.690 --> 24:51.521
It's my proposal

24:52.360 --> 24:56.444
It's so hard, it's leading me astray

24:56.530 --> 24:58.907
-I... I hate my body.
-What?

24:59.160 --> 25:01.993
-Why? It's beautiful.
-Okay, you have to say that.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.039
No. I look at your body every day,
and I think it's perfect.

Was that, uh... Was that okay?

26:54.820 --> 26:57.391
Yeah. It was good.

26:58.110 --> 27:01.898
I could probably do it better
if you wanna try again.

-Just once?
-No. We...

27:30.480 --> 27:31.378
It was all summer.

27:33.230 --> 27:35.266
But it wasn't just the sex.

-Figuring out what I like.

And I want you to remember

29:35.140 --> 29:38.223
That I don't want you
To fall too hard

29:38.310 --> 29:39.891
I don't want your love...

29:40.900 --> 29:43.027
Hey, do you think
we're doing this too much?

29:44.150 --> 29:45.697
Do you think we are?

29:46.610 --> 29:51.024
No. I mean, do you think so?

29:51.530 --> 29:55.534
-Are you okay with all this?
-I'm good.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.332
-So should we--? Okay.
-Yeah. Yes.

30:13.470 --> 30:14.300
[car beeps]

30:17.940 --> 30:20.852
I, uh... I'm gonna meet with Dennis.

30:20.940 --> 30:22.646
-Damage control.
-I'd like to come.

30:24.820 --> 30:26.356
Fine. We're meeting at my house.

30:27.110 --> 30:29.271
I don't want you
to feel alone in this, Liv.

30:30.490 --> 30:33.982
Well, that's nice, Andy. [chuckles]
I'm honored by your concern.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.033
Can you not give one inch?
I'm trying here.

30:37.620 --> 30:40.168
Is there not one goddamn ounce
of forgiveness somewhere?

30:40.250 --> 30:42.161
Some-- Some kind of understanding

30:42.250 --> 30:45.504
that not everybody else
is as self-contained as you are?

30:47.670 --> 30:49.297
Forgiveness for what? For which part?

30:49.380 --> 30:52.508
-The leaving or the not fighting?
-This is you, though.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.131
This is our whole life together.
Not just this trial, not just Hannah.

30:56.220 --> 31:00.554
You have never forgiven weakness,
or imperfection, or struggle.

31:03.820 --> 31:04.855
I forgave...

31:06.190 --> 31:10.229
every weakness, every imperfection,
every mistake that we made

31:10.860 --> 31:12.236
in parenting our daughter.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.539
I guess I'm just surprised
that's all we had.

31:17.660 --> 31:21.573
I lied to you.
I am living with Valerie and her daughter.

31:23.420 --> 31:24.455
I know.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.216
[glass shattering]

31:40.310 --> 31:42.892
[footsteps approaching]

31:58.580 --> 32:00.821
-[front door opens]
-[intruder rustling]

32:00.910 --> 32:02.207
[Matt] Clay, are you home?

32:09.670 --> 32:11.922
-What the hell?
-Aah! It wasn't me!

32:12.720 --> 32:13.755
Who the hell are you?

32:18.390 --> 32:21.882
[student] "Frequent sexual intercourse."
That's what it says.

32:34.070 --> 32:36.231
[Zach] I never told anyone because...

32:44.460 --> 32:46.667
Maybe I was just protecting myself.

32:51.630 --> 32:52.540
What the fuck?

32:52.630 --> 32:54.257
[boys chuckling]

32:55.970 --> 32:58.256
I mean, what gives, Dempsey?

32:58.350 --> 33:00.921
You cash in on your v-card,
and you don't tell your best friend?

33:02.270 --> 33:06.263
-What the fuck, Bryce? What the fuck?
-It's a joke. Lighten the fuck up.

33:06.350 --> 33:10.719
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Hey. Hey! Same team, same team.

33:12.990 --> 33:13.979
Chill out.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.856
What's going on, you two?

33:17.450 --> 33:18.439
It's nothing, Coach.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.649
All right.

33:21.450 --> 33:24.328
If it's nothing, I don't wanna see
that kind of behavior in here again.

33:24.410 --> 33:26.116
And I don't wanna see it out there.
Hear me?

33:28.210 --> 33:30.337
That goes for all of us. Okay?

33:30.420 --> 33:32.547
I don't care
who the hell you are out there.

33:32.630 --> 33:36.714
You step into this room,
you step across that baseline,

33:36.800 --> 33:38.131
you are the Liberty Tigers.

33:39.010 --> 33:40.966
The end. Yeah?

33:41.060 --> 33:42.379
[students] Yeah.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.306
[indistinct chattering]

33:47.440 --> 33:49.601
Olivia, I just don't think
we should call him.

33:50.230 --> 33:51.970
I mean, Sonya will tear him apart.

33:52.070 --> 33:54.356
They must know everything
about the kid, right?

33:54.530 --> 33:55.940
And we don't.

33:56.530 --> 33:58.236
Lainie did recuse herself, but that's--

33:58.320 --> 34:03.610
Somehow, I'm not concerned
about a mother knowing her son's secrets.

34:04.830 --> 34:08.709
That tends not to be the case
these days, it seems, with mothers.

34:08.790 --> 34:09.620
Liv...

34:10.040 --> 34:11.337
Our daughter...

34:13.420 --> 34:14.580
I mean, she...

34:15.970 --> 34:19.292
becomes a woman, and we missed it?

34:19.390 --> 34:21.096
[Andy] But is this the right response?

34:22.310 --> 34:25.347
We put another kid on the stand
and hope for the best?

34:25.430 --> 34:27.227
There's a reason
why we kept him off the list.

34:27.520 --> 34:31.479
Clay was devastated
when Hannah died, okay?

34:31.560 --> 34:35.109
He was in love with her.
He thought she was perfect.

34:35.530 --> 34:37.066
The jury needs to hear that.

34:37.610 --> 34:39.350
All right, we'll have to prep him tonight.

34:39.450 --> 34:42.237
Go ahead and fill out the paperwork.
I'll talk to him first.

34:42.700 --> 34:44.361
What the fuck did you do?

34:45.370 --> 34:48.919
Why would you say all of that?
You just made everything worse for her.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.069
I didn't mean to.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.661
Clay, I swear to God, it's not a lie.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.457
-I'm sorry.
-So how come no one knew about it?

34:56.260 --> 34:58.546
-You were out of town last summer.
-It wasn't on your tape.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.040
She put everything on your tape?

35:04.220 --> 35:05.346
You didn't deserve her.

35:05.970 --> 35:07.426
I know. I'm sorry.

35:08.810 --> 35:11.222
Fuck you. You just go to hell.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.187
-Clay, come on, man.
-Get the fuck out of here!

35:21.660 --> 35:23.651
[car engine starting]

35:32.170 --> 35:33.910
You have something you wanna say to me?

35:47.350 --> 35:50.342
[cell phone vibrating]

35:57.860 --> 36:01.444
Hey. I've been looking for you everywhere.
It's called The Clubhouse.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.366
-Wait, what?
-The place in the Polaroids.

36:04.450 --> 36:05.519
It's called The Clubhouse.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.907
Jesus. I don't care anymore.

36:08.290 --> 36:09.359
What?

36:10.290 --> 36:13.282
-How do you go from--?
-Look, I don't fucking care, okay?

36:13.370 --> 36:14.621
I'm done.

36:14.710 --> 36:16.029
[cell phone vibrating]

36:16.130 --> 36:17.449
I have to take this.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.049
So, I'll see you.

36:42.530 --> 36:45.567
All right, put your guns down, guys.
Guns on the table.

36:48.330 --> 36:50.116
We're gonna put in a fresh clip, okay?

36:50.200 --> 36:51.747
Cyrus, look at this.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.573
We're going to eject the old clip
like that by pressing that button.

36:55.670 --> 36:57.490
Roll in the new clip like so.

36:58.420 --> 37:00.661
Rack the slide. Okay?

37:05.340 --> 37:07.296
-You guys try it.
-Cool.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.671
Remember,
even if there's no clip in there,

37:09.760 --> 37:12.263
always treat your guns
as if they're loaded.

37:12.350 --> 37:13.419
-Okay?
-Yeah.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.340
All right. Give it a shot.

37:17.650 --> 37:19.515
I really appreciate this.

37:19.690 --> 37:22.102
My wife didn't think
it was appropriate to call,

37:22.190 --> 37:24.522
but we don't know anybody else
we could ask,

37:24.610 --> 37:27.738
and Alex has been a good friend to Tyler.

37:28.030 --> 37:31.079
Oh, well, I'm happy to do it.
Tyler's a good kid.

37:37.330 --> 37:38.160
[gunshot]

37:46.380 --> 37:47.836
I'm plateauing.

37:48.890 --> 37:51.006
-Plateauing?
-Yeah.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.473
Apparently, that happens
when you shoot yourself in the head.

37:56.270 --> 37:58.977
After, like, six months,
no matter how much work you put in,

37:59.060 --> 38:01.517
your body just settles
into being broken forever.

38:01.770 --> 38:03.397
Come on. You had a rough couple days--

38:03.480 --> 38:05.698
It's not a rough couple of days, Zach.

38:06.490 --> 38:08.151
This is my life now.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.860
My doctor said so.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.781
Pretty sure your doctor didn't say that.

38:12.870 --> 38:13.825
Well, I can't testify.

38:14.700 --> 38:17.703
I can't help Hannah, I can't help Jess.
I'm useless.

38:17.790 --> 38:20.532
Well, maybe that's for the better.

38:21.750 --> 38:22.956
What is that supposed to mean?

38:23.050 --> 38:24.335
After what happened to me today,

38:24.420 --> 38:27.253
-maybe you don't wanna testify.
-Don't tell me what I fucking want.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.295
-Alex--
-Man, at least you can do it.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.041
And at least you can walk and fuck girls.

38:32.510 --> 38:33.340
Fuck.

38:33.430 --> 38:34.340
-Alex.
-Fuck you!

38:34.430 --> 38:36.978
-Alex, don't--
-Get the fuck off of me!

38:37.060 --> 38:40.052
Fuck my leg
and this fucking hole in my head.

38:40.770 --> 38:43.568
And then fuck Justin
for coming back for Jessica.

38:43.650 --> 38:45.982
-And fuck Jessica, too!
-Look, man, just--

38:46.150 --> 38:48.232
-No! Get off of me!
-Come on.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.230
Alex, stop.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.322
-Fight me! Man, fight me!
-Calm down, Alex.

38:52.410 --> 38:54.731
-Just-- I'm not gonna--
-Fuck you!

38:54.830 --> 38:58.072
-Whoa! Stop, stop, stop!
-What? What's wrong? What's wrong?

38:58.960 --> 38:59.915
I, uh...

39:07.720 --> 39:09.256
[Zach] I, um...

39:10.550 --> 39:13.678
[stuttering]
Man... Uh, listen. It's probably just...

39:14.010 --> 39:17.969
like, from the physical contact and, um...

39:18.520 --> 39:19.885
Are you okay?

39:22.310 --> 39:23.140
Yeah.

39:24.570 --> 39:25.468
Yeah, I am.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.770
My dick works. [chuckles]

39:30.360 --> 39:31.486
Yeah.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.112
[both panting]

39:35.950 --> 39:38.407
We need you to talk about your friendship.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.201
About what you two meant to each other.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.410
Her kindness.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.159
Will they ask me...

39:49.630 --> 39:51.120
about kissing her?

39:53.720 --> 39:55.176
They probably will.

39:56.220 --> 39:58.131
But it was just one kiss.

39:59.810 --> 40:03.143
It's important that the jury understands
who Hannah really was.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.762
Dennis will ask you
what you two talked about,

40:07.150 --> 40:10.779
the hopes and dreams
that Hannah shared with you,

40:10.860 --> 40:12.191
her good qualities.

40:12.490 --> 40:13.855
This trial...

40:16.450 --> 40:19.942
I mean, I've learned things about Hannah
I guess I didn't know before.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.320
I understand.

40:22.460 --> 40:23.700
Me, too.

40:24.580 --> 40:27.799
I feel like I didn't really know
who she was.

40:29.420 --> 40:32.253
Can you put all of that
out of your mind, though, and...

40:33.130 --> 40:37.806
focus on who Hannah really was to you?

40:44.020 --> 40:45.647
[Jessica] I couldn't move.

40:46.400 --> 40:50.188
He got on top of me,
and I couldn't move my arms.

40:51.940 --> 40:54.693
Or if I did,
he'd just push them back down.

40:55.410 --> 40:59.198
He just kept pushing everywhere.

40:59.950 --> 41:01.690
He wouldn't listen.

41:02.620 --> 41:06.033
I can still feel his hands
taking off my underwear.

41:07.080 --> 41:09.799
I just feel him all the time.

41:10.130 --> 41:13.668
IfI kiss someone, I can feel his breath.

41:15.720 --> 41:19.679
If I touch someone, I just remember
trying to get him not to touch me.

41:23.640 --> 41:27.303
God. So it's really fucking stupid
that I'm worried about Justin

41:27.400 --> 41:31.473
when he's one of the goddamn reasons
why I'm dealing with all of this shit.

41:31.570 --> 41:32.525
[sniffles]

41:36.990 --> 41:39.732
[Zach] You fool yourself into thinking
that by keeping things hidden,

41:40.080 --> 41:41.980
it makes it easier for you to get by.

41:42.080 --> 41:44.571
[Caleb] ...people looking at me right now,
facing the other side,

41:44.660 --> 41:46.366
and the twos will be
with their backs to me.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.870
Let's face our partners.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.997
Let the ones be aggressors,
let's have them grab at the neck.

41:51.090 --> 41:54.912
The twos break the grip, throw the palm,
grab the shoulders, throw the knee.

41:55.010 --> 41:56.716
-[grunting]
-There you go. Speed it up.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.007
Here, Lucas, you can switch
with Selena for a second.

41:59.090 --> 42:00.170
Thank you.

42:00.390 --> 42:02.426
All right? One more time.
You're gonna grab my neck.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.670
We're gonna break the grip,
we're gonna throw the palm,

42:04.770 --> 42:05.930
throw the knee.

42:06.020 --> 42:08.181
All right? We'll switch,
and this is with the sound.

42:08.270 --> 42:09.350
Ready? Grab my neck.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.510
[grunting]

42:12.940 --> 42:14.430
-There you go. You good?
-Yeah.

42:14.530 --> 42:16.851
Get back in line. Selena, switch over.
The twos are the aggressors.

42:16.950 --> 42:19.817
[Zach] Even though you know you'd feel
a lot better if you just came clean.

42:19.910 --> 42:22.447
[hard rock music playing]

42:25.500 --> 42:29.709
Don't drink it_ so fast.
That's a one-way trip to barf town.

42:31.290 --> 42:32.871
-[chuckles]
-[groans]

42:34.210 --> 42:37.794
-Sounds fun.
-Not so, my friend.

42:41.470 --> 42:42.425
[Cyrus] It is done.

42:42.890 --> 42:47.179
You hack_ed Zach's iCloud account
In two minutes?

42:47.270 --> 42:50.091
His password was "zachattack," so...

42:51.060 --> 42:51.936
[scoffs]

42:54.570 --> 42:56.310
[Cyrus] Isn't that the girl that died?

43:00.360 --> 43:03.022
Yeah. That's weird.

43:03.700 --> 43:04.860
What's that?

43:05.830 --> 43:10.449
[boys chanting]
Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!

43:10.710 --> 43:12.996
-Holy shit.
-This is incredible.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.490
[chanting continues on video]

43:15.590 --> 43:18.081
-We have to send this everywhere.
-No. No, no, no.

43:19.260 --> 43:21.330
No, let's fuck with him first.

43:22.640 --> 43:26.883
No, I mean, I think... I think
you're really brave to talk about Justin.

43:28.890 --> 43:31.097
Is there anyone else you wanna talk about?

43:32.650 --> 43:35.107
-Bryce
_ ma b
Bryce? e?

43:36.030 --> 43:37.986
[scoffs] What do you mean?

43:40.900 --> 43:41.946
Look”.

43:43.450 --> 43:46.408
I've been the girl
who's avoided her rapist in the halls.

43:47.790 --> 43:51.078
Mine was a senior named Mark Perry.

43:52.210 --> 43:55.122
And it's a story for another time, but...

43:56.380 --> 43:58.837
I'm choosing to say his name to you
even though I didn't turn him in.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.217
You wanna know why?

44:02.180 --> 44:06.674
Because it's my fucking story to tell.
No one else's.

44:07.060 --> 44:11.303
And you should be so proud
that you told yours tonight.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.142
-I am.
-Good.

44:20.900 --> 44:23.858
You know, just know that you can always,
always talk about it with me.

44:24.820 --> 44:25.775
I get it.

44:28.330 --> 44:29.945
Hugs.

44:33.040 --> 44:35.622
Look, I was trying to help Hannah's case.

44:35.710 --> 44:37.496
[Lainie] By hiding Justin here?

44:37.590 --> 44:41.959
In the home of a lavwer
whose firm is trying the case?

44:42.050 --> 44:43.870
Do you have any idea how that could look?

44:43.970 --> 44:46.211
It's not just appearances
we're worried about.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.466
Matt, I'm an officer of the court.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.222
Justin failed to respond to his subpoena.
He's in contempt.

44:51.310 --> 44:54.393
Look, I was hiding him here because
I didn't have any other options, okay?

44:54.480 --> 44:57.358
What about the option
of coming to talk to us as promised?

44:57.440 --> 44:58.646
I had nowhere to go.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.641
That's why he had no other options.

45:01.990 --> 45:04.697
My mom is a junkie.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.481
And her boyfriend is...

45:08.410 --> 45:11.573
He's a dealer and not a very nice guy.

45:13.330 --> 45:15.412
I knew that they wouldn't take me back.

45:15.500 --> 45:19.834
Clay and Tony, they found me...
and saved me.

45:21.340 --> 45:22.500
He didn't tell you guys

45:22.590 --> 45:25.252
because I was too ashamed
for anyone to know.

45:27.010 --> 45:28.716
[coughs]

45:31.890 --> 45:34.381
And he's sick with the flu,

45:34.480 --> 45:36.801
which is why we were waiting for him
to testify.

45:38.900 --> 45:40.856
You can stay as long as you need, Justin.

45:42.070 --> 45:45.449
But I will need to report you being back
to the lawyers.

45:45.530 --> 45:48.988
-I'm sorry, it's the law.
-That's okay. I understand.

45:49.320 --> 45:52.539
Thank you, Mrs. Jensen and Mr. Jensen.

45:54.120 --> 45:57.169
Now... who's hungry?

45:57.710 --> 46:00.998
[Mackenzie] Really?
You threw up on his favorite boots.

46:03.510 --> 46:07.253
What were you guys drinking?
'Cause he is out cold.

46:07.340 --> 46:10.218
Uh, he said it was his special recipe.

46:10.680 --> 46:11.999
[both laugh]

46:12.100 --> 46:14.056
What were you guys even working on?

46:14.980 --> 46:15.924
Um...

46:16.600 --> 46:18.010
You got a little...

46:21.820 --> 46:22.855
There you go.

46:24.940 --> 46:26.350
He's gonna hate me.

46:27.150 --> 46:30.529
Why? I'm not telling him what happened.

46:31.160 --> 46:35.403
You don't have to either, you know?
It could just be our secret.

46:36.330 --> 46:37.706
Like just me and you.

46:38.750 --> 46:41.628
Okay. Thanks.

46:43.460 --> 46:44.336
Yeah.

46:44.670 --> 46:47.082
What are we paying the Walkers' lawyer for

46:47.170 --> 46:49.001
if you're just gonna keep secrets
from him?

46:50.010 --> 46:52.251
And this was happening all last summer?

46:56.020 --> 46:59.933
-No, I wasn't ready. [sighs]
-And... save.

47:01.650 --> 47:02.469
[camera clicks]

47:02.560 --> 47:04.858
No, I'm not ready.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.528
[whines] I don't wanna go back to school.

47:09.610 --> 47:12.864
Junior year's like the only year
that counts on your transcript.

47:13.490 --> 47:14.445
[cell phone beeps]

47:16.540 --> 47:18.997
Oh, Bryce is back and wants to party.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.912
If you want, we can hang with him later.
I don't have plans.

47:23.670 --> 47:24.955
Actually...

47:26.420 --> 47:28.911
I don't want my friends
to know about this.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.715
Us.

47:31.930 --> 47:34.672
I just kind of want this to be ours,
you know?

47:36.970 --> 47:38.881
Um... yeah, okay.

47:46.940 --> 47:48.487
Why would you keep this from me?

47:49.280 --> 47:51.771
-'Cause that's how we do things, isn't it?
-What does that mean?

47:52.110 --> 47:54.408
I don't even know
how you feel about Dad dying.

47:55.580 --> 47:57.400
I don't know how you feel about anything.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.490
What if I felt like Hannah did?

47:59.960 --> 48:02.497
Because I have, Mom. I actually have.

48:03.130 --> 48:05.496
-What would you do?
-Zachary Shan-Yung Dempsey,

48:05.710 --> 48:08.292
that is enough. Don't say such things.

48:08.630 --> 48:10.211
-Why not?
-This trial...

48:10.840 --> 48:13.331
That girl has put thoughts in your head.

48:14.470 --> 48:17.928
You do not feel that way. You're fine.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.760
Yeah, exactly. [sniffles]

48:24.560 --> 48:25.686
I'm fine.

48:31.070 --> 48:33.903
Well, what about Jessica's party?
I mean, you didn't talk to him there.

48:33.990 --> 48:36.697
He was drunk and stupid
by the time I showed up.

48:36.780 --> 48:38.236
So why didn't you put it on his tape?

48:39.410 --> 48:41.822
Maybe I was keeping it private
for me and him.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.709
-Or maybe you were protecting yourself.
-Yes. I mean, maybe I was.

48:47.210 --> 48:51.123
Maybe it hurt that it meant something
to me and not to him.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.728
IfI had been in town that summer...

49:05.690 --> 49:06.896
would it have been me instead?

49:10.280 --> 49:11.599
[door opening]

49:20.290 --> 49:21.234
You thinking about Zach?

49:23.960 --> 49:26.747
What? No.

49:28.210 --> 49:30.087
I read that stupid blog.

49:30.500 --> 49:35.176
I have to tell hundreds of people tomorrow
what I loved about Hannah,

49:36.050 --> 49:38.962
and all I can think about
is how she lost her virginity to Zach.

49:39.050 --> 49:40.176
I mean, Zach.

49:40.720 --> 49:42.631
Then, like, a month later,
she hooked up with me,

49:42.720 --> 49:43.550
and then she freaked out.

49:43.640 --> 49:46.643
But she didn't freak out
when she hooked up with Zach? I mean...

49:47.350 --> 49:49.432
What the fuck are you saying, Jensen?

49:50.610 --> 49:55.730
I mean, do you know how many girls
I've slept with?

49:56.360 --> 49:57.600
Like, a lot.

49:57.860 --> 50:00.738
Classifies me as, like,
a player or something and...

50:01.240 --> 50:04.289
my best friends used to think
I was the fucking best.

50:04.370 --> 50:05.530
Okay.

50:05.620 --> 50:08.748
Hannah, she sleeps with one guy.

50:08.830 --> 50:14.757
She has a crush on another guy, being me,
and she kisses a third, being you.

50:15.510 --> 50:17.717
And it's whatever, it's all fine, right?

50:18.260 --> 50:20.467
All of a sudden, she's a slut?

50:21.350 --> 50:22.999
All of a sudden,
you don't know who she is?

50:24.890 --> 50:27.051
-You're a dumbass.
-I'm not a dumbass.

50:27.230 --> 50:30.393
You're dumb. You're an ass. Dumbass.

50:31.730 --> 50:33.971
I'm not the dumbass
who got locked out of the house today.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.810
Clay, I didn't get locked out today.

50:42.490 --> 50:44.867
Someone broke in. I...

50:44.950 --> 50:48.033
I didn't see who it was,
and I didn't tell your parents.

50:48.120 --> 50:49.166
What the fuck?

50:49.580 --> 50:51.582
I mean, who the fuck
have you pissed off lately?

50:54.460 --> 50:57.714
Bryce. It has to be Bryce.

50:57.880 --> 51:01.043
Did he leave anything,
or did he take anything?

51:01.510 --> 51:04.889
Fuck. I don't-- I was downstairs
with your parents this whole--

51:04.970 --> 51:06.176
Fuck.

51:27.870 --> 51:29.781
-What is it?
-Wha--?

51:30.670 --> 51:32.240
Nothing. It's-- It's good.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.410
Everything's here.

51:38.470 --> 51:40.927
[Zach]
Hannah had nothing to be ashamed of.

51:42.300 --> 51:44.177
I made her feel like she did.

51:45.510 --> 51:48.809
Because I don't tell people things,
like I said.

51:51.480 --> 51:54.813
[Bryce]
Five tickets for Sudden Descent, please.

51:54.900 --> 51:57.778
Hey, are you still wearing
that lacy, black underwear?

51:57.860 --> 51:59.145
[Willem] Yeah, come on, show us.

51:59.240 --> 52:03.199
Oh. Miles and miles of skin.

52:03.280 --> 52:06.989
-[Bryce] All right, ladies. Enough.
-[Montgomery] What? It makes me feel free.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.401
Yeah, just keep the change.
Thank you, sweetheart.

52:14.580 --> 52:15.740
So, yeah...

52:16.210 --> 52:18.121
[indistinct chatter]

52:20.970 --> 52:22.506
[Zach] Shit. I forgot my wallet, guys.

52:22.590 --> 52:24.581
-I'll meet you out there.
-[Bryce] All right.

52:31.520 --> 52:32.635
Hey.

52:34.270 --> 52:35.305
Sorry about earlier.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.641
I didn't want them
to make fun of you or anything.

52:37.730 --> 52:38.970
They made fun of me anyway.

52:39.530 --> 52:42.101
Right. I'm sorry about that.

52:43.150 --> 52:44.902
Can I make it up to you,

52:46.780 --> 52:48.441
uh, sometime?

52:50.040 --> 52:51.359
Uh, you were right before.

52:52.500 --> 52:55.822
Maybe it's best if we just keep this thing
between us.

52:56.590 --> 53:00.003
You know, if we end it now,
then it stays good. Not complicated.

53:02.260 --> 53:03.215
Yeah.

53:04.470 --> 53:07.041
Yeah, no, that sounds good.

53:10.390 --> 53:11.846
Okay. Cool.

53:16.480 --> 53:18.812
[Zach] Hannah didn't tell me
how she felt either.

53:20.030 --> 53:23.181
But now... I guess I know.

53:48.850 --> 53:52.013
And I'll be ashamed
for the rest of my life.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.841
And shame burns.

Of an idle machine

54:45.280 --> 54:48.989
It's been so long

My mind is drawing a blank

54:52.910 --> 54:56.653
Don't know ifI can go back

But to live out this dream

55:00.580 --> 55:04.289
It's just my luck

I call you up
