00:10.672 --> 00:12.973
Yeah, I read your latest blog post.

00:13.041 --> 00:15.476
As soon as I put it up
I got, like, 76 replies.

00:15.544 --> 00:17.011
I can't be bothered teaching some city girl

00:17.045 --> 00:18.246
how to sit on a horse.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.365
Lou: Everyone, Tricia.

00:20.549 --> 00:22.350
Jack: Hi, again.

00:22.417 --> 00:23.717
- Tim: Tricia, is it?
- Tricia: Yeah.

00:23.752 --> 00:25.218
- Tim: Tim Fleming.
- Tricia: Hi.

00:25.253 --> 00:26.986
I'm the father of the girls.
I'll be teaching you to ride.

Okay, boy, let's give this a try.

00:47.307 --> 00:48.340
(Horse whinnies and snorts)

00:48.473 --> 00:49.173
Hey!

00:50.575 --> 00:52.710
What's up?

00:52.778 --> 00:53.677
What's going on, bud?

00:55.447 --> 00:57.948
Look, there you go.

00:57.982 --> 00:59.983
All right, let's try the other one.

01:01.919 --> 01:02.619
Hey!

01:07.491 --> 01:08.391
What is your problem?

01:12.230 --> 01:14.529
<i>Ty: Hey, how's it goin'?</i>

01:14.597 --> 01:16.265
Amy: Not great.

01:16.332 --> 01:17.199
I'm trying to figure out what's going on

01:17.234 --> 01:18.300
with Caleb's barrel horse.

01:20.303 --> 01:23.005
Since when is Caleb into barrel racing?

01:23.039 --> 01:24.539
(Chuckles) He's not.

01:24.574 --> 01:25.908
He bought him off a gal who just retired.

01:25.976 --> 01:28.043
His name's Hotshot

01:28.111 --> 01:30.278
<i>and he's gotta lot of
miles and a lotta wins,</i>

01:30.345 --> 01:33.815
but, so far, I don't know.

01:33.849 --> 01:35.817
Caleb's trying to flip
him, make a good buck.

01:35.851 --> 01:36.751
So what's the problem?

01:38.287 --> 01:40.221
(Sighs) Well...

01:40.256 --> 01:41.689
every time I bring him up to a barrel,

01:41.723 --> 01:44.926
he just blows off the side and freaks out.

01:44.994 --> 01:46.359
I guess it's back to square one.

01:46.394 --> 01:47.460
Someone's gonna have to take him

01:47.495 --> 01:48.762
around the pattern again and again

01:48.830 --> 01:50.563
until he gets the hang of it.

01:50.598 --> 01:52.933
And you're that someone?

01:53.001 --> 01:54.734
Well, actually, now that you're here,

01:54.769 --> 01:57.771
maybe you could try?

01:57.806 --> 01:59.406
Amy, I just pulled an
all-nighter at the clinic.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.240
You know that, right?

02:00.275 --> 02:02.308
Ty, come on, please?

02:02.342 --> 02:03.375
It would just really help me
if I could see how he performs

02:03.410 --> 02:05.912
for someone else.

02:05.946 --> 02:08.479
All right, all right.
Where's Caleb anyways?

02:08.514 --> 02:10.149
Why isn't he here helping ya?

02:10.217 --> 02:12.084
Amy: Well, he's in town... working.

02:13.954 --> 02:14.386
Ty: For Nicole?

02:16.589 --> 02:20.025

<i>Caleb: Well, that was real good.</i>

02:25.731 --> 02:27.032
Why don't you hop down off of there, champ?

02:27.066 --> 02:27.899
Oh, look at you!

02:32.839 --> 02:34.305
All right, buckaroos, who's next for a ride

02:34.339 --> 02:36.307
on a real, live, workin' cow pony?

02:36.341 --> 02:37.241
- Boy: It's me!
- Caleb: Let's do it.

02:37.275 --> 02:39.409
Let's jump on up. (Grunts)

02:39.444 --> 02:41.910
Yeah, all right! (Chuckles)

02:42.480 --> 02:43.848
(Insects buzz, fishing line whips)

02:43.915 --> 02:46.884
Jack: Oh, not bad, not
bad. Okay, let one go!

02:46.918 --> 02:48.685
(Fishing line whirs)

02:48.720 --> 02:50.987
Pretty darn good for a first time!

02:51.055 --> 02:54.557
Here, let me give ya a
hand. Ooh, not too far now!

02:54.591 --> 02:55.892
Georgie: So when do we
get to go up to your cabin

02:55.960 --> 02:58.361
to catch some real fish?

02:58.428 --> 03:02.031
Jack: Well, how about soon
as you get back from Banff?

03:02.066 --> 03:03.967
Georgie: (Sighs) I wish
I didn't have to go.

03:04.001 --> 03:05.735
I just don't get it.

03:05.802 --> 03:07.069
We already live in the country

03:07.103 --> 03:08.603
and I see the mountains every day.

03:08.637 --> 03:10.372
Jack: Come on now,
that's beautiful scenery,

03:10.439 --> 03:13.141
you get enough of that.
It's a nice family vacation.

03:13.209 --> 03:15.477
You'll probably see
some elk, mountain goats,

03:15.511 --> 03:16.544
maybe even a bear or two.

03:18.481 --> 03:20.648
Georgie: It sounds okay, I guess.

03:20.683 --> 03:22.816
You know, seeing the bear part, but...

03:24.819 --> 03:27.821
it's just... I'd rather be fishing.

03:27.890 --> 03:30.557
Jack: Well, spoken like a true fisherman!

03:30.625 --> 03:32.193
(Chuckling, fishing line whips)

03:35.697 --> 03:36.697
Georgie: Impressive!

03:36.731 --> 03:39.366
Jack: Thank you.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.768
Tricia: So how am I doing?
I think I'm pretty good, huh?

03:41.835 --> 03:43.403
Tim: Well, you're a little
tight on the reins still.

03:43.470 --> 03:44.537
You're pulling on his mouth.

03:44.571 --> 03:47.307
You know, they have sensitive mouths.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.575
And you don't need to kick him,
just give him a little squeeze.

03:49.643 --> 03:52.645
Tricia: Okay, cowboy, everything else?

03:52.679 --> 03:54.446
Well, I'd say C-plus, doctor.

03:56.349 --> 03:57.216
I made it through med school, Tim.

03:57.284 --> 03:58.350
I'm used to straight A's.

03:58.418 --> 03:59.351
(Chuckles)

03:59.419 --> 04:00.085
Cheeky.

04:03.123 --> 04:06.491
Oh, this is beautiful!

04:06.559 --> 04:07.259
Yeah.

04:09.029 --> 04:10.528
You think this is nice,

04:10.595 --> 04:12.563
you oughta see the fishing cabin.

04:12.597 --> 04:13.731
You have a fishing cabin?

04:13.799 --> 04:15.066
Few hours north in the mountains.

04:15.134 --> 04:16.334
You never told me that.

04:16.402 --> 04:18.636
River's full of rainbow, browns,

04:18.702 --> 04:20.305
got a mountain view.

04:20.372 --> 04:21.406
It's kind of a family secret.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.840
Oh, it sounds wonderful!

04:25.510 --> 04:27.477
You know, I've always wanted
to learn how to fly fish.

04:27.545 --> 04:28.478
Really?

04:28.546 --> 04:30.914
Yeah.

04:30.982 --> 04:32.249
If you're ever heading out there

04:32.283 --> 04:33.383
and you feel like giving
me some fishing lessons,

04:33.451 --> 04:36.286
I'd be happy to tag along.

04:36.354 --> 04:38.121
Well, you check your schedule,
I'll check my schedule,

04:38.156 --> 04:39.856
next time we run into each other

04:39.890 --> 04:41.691
we'll, uh, make a plan.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.960
How about tomorrow?

04:43.994 --> 04:46.062
Well, I gotta check a few things,

04:46.096 --> 04:49.731
you know, clear the decks,
but, uh, yeah, tomorrow...

04:51.368 --> 04:53.535
Tomorrow'll be good.

04:53.603 --> 04:54.270
Okay.

04:57.607 --> 05:00.108
So you got juice boxes, rice cakes?

05:00.186 --> 05:01.286
Peter: I've got more healthy treats
than anyone could possibly eat

05:01.320 --> 05:02.520
between here and Banff.

05:02.555 --> 05:03.621
Lou: It's not just the drive,

05:03.656 --> 05:06.658
we've got a whole two days there.

05:06.693 --> 05:07.492
Peter: Yeah, you know, I heard
they actually have stores there,

05:07.560 --> 05:08.794
so we should be okay.

05:08.828 --> 05:09.995
Lou: We don't want to
spend our time shopping,

05:10.063 --> 05:11.163
- we want to spend our time
- (Cell phone rings)

05:11.197 --> 05:12.764
having the best family vacation ever!

05:12.799 --> 05:15.199
Peter: Yes. Oh, hold on. (Beeps phone on)

05:15.233 --> 05:16.033
That's work, I gotta take this.

05:16.068 --> 05:18.020
Lou: Oh, come on.

05:18.636 --> 05:20.304
Katie: Mama...

05:20.338 --> 05:21.072
Peter: (Into phone) Hey, buddy, what's up?

05:21.139 --> 05:23.040
(To Lou) Thanks.

05:23.075 --> 05:24.041
Yeah, I know. We're headin' up to Banff,

05:24.076 --> 05:26.811
just me, Lou, and the kids.

05:26.845 --> 05:31.081
Three days and two nights.
It's gonna be great.

05:31.115 --> 05:32.747
No, no, no, what do you
mean change of plans?

05:32.749 --> 05:33.790
I can't, man, I...

05:34.919 --> 05:36.419
(Sighs) Lou's got her heart set on it,

05:36.453 --> 05:38.387
that's why, I...

05:40.222 --> 05:42.891
Okay, what kind of sweetener?

05:42.925 --> 05:44.092
(Overlapping chatter, music playing)

05:44.126 --> 05:44.425

09:00.213 --> 09:02.013
to the Alberta Oil & Gas
Product & Process Development

09:02.048 --> 09:03.148
managers conference.

09:03.182 --> 09:04.916
Oh?

09:04.951 --> 09:07.152
Peter: And guess what,

09:07.220 --> 09:08.119
apparently I'm the perfect candidate.

09:08.153 --> 09:10.520
Oh.

09:10.555 --> 09:13.090
So an oil guys' conference. Let me guess:

09:13.158 --> 09:15.726
You'll be working the
entire time we're in Banff?

09:15.761 --> 09:18.629
Well, uh, that's just it.

09:18.663 --> 09:22.767
Actually, um... the
conference is not in Banff.

09:22.801 --> 09:24.735
It's actually in Fort McMurray.

09:24.769 --> 09:26.002
I know, I know, it sounds horrible,

09:26.036 --> 09:28.305
but, um, there is a sweetener.

09:30.341 --> 09:34.177
Okay, I'll bite. What's the sweetener?

09:34.211 --> 09:38.081
They want you to give the talk
to the Petroleum Wives Club.

09:38.115 --> 09:39.516
- What?
- I'm pretty sure it's the only reason

09:39.550 --> 09:40.784
they're asking me to go, sweetheart.

09:40.818 --> 09:43.186
Honestly, I mean, product
and process development?

09:43.254 --> 09:46.355
It's not even my department,
so it's because of your blog.

09:46.423 --> 09:48.057
Really?! Like did they say that?

09:48.125 --> 09:50.160
Yeah.

09:50.194 --> 09:51.427
And, you know, I know that we've been

09:51.461 --> 09:52.728
looking forward to Banff
for a really long time,

09:52.797 --> 09:54.998
and I can get out of it, but I just...

09:55.065 --> 09:58.033
Uh, no, no, no, I... we should go.

09:58.101 --> 10:00.502
It's your job and your responsibility

10:00.536 --> 10:04.773
and it would be my first
public speaking engagement.

10:04.841 --> 10:06.809
Okay, well, so we're settled then, right?

10:06.876 --> 10:09.044
Oh, how are we gonna tell Georgie?

Ty: Yeah, he's fighting
me every inch of the way.

10:21.857 --> 10:22.857
You want to help me out
and hold him for a second?

10:22.891 --> 10:23.958
I just want to check his teeth.

10:24.026 --> 10:25.426

think it's his teeth though.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.431
<i>I really think it's his attitude.</i>

10:31.465 --> 10:32.732
(Truck rumbles up and shuts off)

10:32.800 --> 10:33.633
Come here, buddy.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.103
Ty: Well, if they haven't
been done recently,

10:37.138 --> 10:39.539
<i>the bit might be hurting him.</i>

10:39.573 --> 10:41.074
They seem okay to me.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.376
Amy: Hmm. How about you hop on him

10:43.444 --> 10:46.312
and just walk him around, let him chill?

10:46.379 --> 10:46.812
Ty: All right.

10:48.748 --> 10:52.617
- Tim: Hey!
- Amy: Hey, dad, what's up?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.854
Tim: Oh, you know, just dropped
by to see how you're doing.

10:54.888 --> 10:55.855
I'm good. I'm busy.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.824
Good!

10:58.859 --> 11:00.892
Well, there's Jack's truck,
huh? Last time I was here,

11:00.926 --> 11:02.360
he said was gonna go
fly fishing with Georgie

11:02.394 --> 11:03.761
up at the cabin.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.396
Uh, they were, but now Georgie's

11:05.430 --> 11:07.598
going up to Banff with Lou and Peter.

11:07.632 --> 11:10.735
So the cabin's empty... as usual.

11:10.769 --> 11:13.437
Yeah. Why the sudden interest?

11:13.472 --> 11:16.274
Hey, uh, is he taking
up barrel racing or... ?

11:16.308 --> 11:17.741
Are you taking up barrel racing?

11:19.110 --> 11:20.410
(Chuckles)

11:22.413 --> 11:25.615
So we're not going to Banff?

11:25.649 --> 11:27.885
Peter: No, and we know that it's a
huge disappointment to you, honey,

11:27.919 --> 11:30.053
but things change all the
time in the oil business

11:30.088 --> 11:31.989
and we have to learn to be flexible, okay?

11:32.023 --> 11:34.257
Lou: And when we do go to
Banff, we want to go as a family.

11:34.291 --> 11:38.761
So no elk, no bears,
no hiking up mountains?

11:38.795 --> 11:41.463
No, not for now... not this weekend...

11:41.498 --> 11:43.900
but we promise we are
gonna go another time, okay?

11:43.934 --> 11:45.268
<i>Peter: And, hey, you know what?</i>

11:45.335 --> 11:47.336
<i>It's actually peak tourist
season right now anyway,</i>

11:47.371 --> 11:49.470
so it'll be way more fun
if we wait a few weeks.

11:49.505 --> 11:51.672
Lou: Yeah.

11:51.707 --> 11:54.642
Do you think maybe, while you're gone,

11:54.676 --> 11:57.412
Jack could take me fishing or something,

11:57.446 --> 12:00.382
just so that I'm not so disappointed?

12:00.416 --> 12:02.583
Lou: Yes, that is a great idea.

12:02.618 --> 12:04.985
You know, I'm sure grampa
would be happy to take you,

12:05.020 --> 12:07.254
especially if you ask him nicely.

12:07.322 --> 12:08.555
Okay, I'll see what he says.

12:11.826 --> 12:15.595
<i>Jack! Jack! Guess what!
We're not going to Banff!</i>

12:15.663 --> 12:16.863
That went well.

12:16.932 --> 12:17.597
Yeah.

12:24.871 --> 12:27.106
The Petroleum Wives Club?
Wait, you're kidding me.

12:27.141 --> 12:28.942
Is this the 1950s?

12:29.009 --> 12:30.476
I know, it sounds a little old fashioned,

12:30.544 --> 12:32.912
but, I mean, look at the activities.

12:32.980 --> 12:35.748
Mindfulness, pilates, wine tasting...

12:35.782 --> 12:37.615
Rock climbing, yoga...

12:37.650 --> 12:40.385
And talkin' babies,
which is where I come in.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.686
So you're really going?

12:41.754 --> 12:42.955
Peter and I fly out to Fort McMurray

12:43.022 --> 12:44.356
first thing in the morning.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.858
Okay, and what about Georgie?

12:46.926 --> 12:48.427
Grampa's taking her to the fishing cabin.

12:48.494 --> 12:49.494
And Katie?

12:51.230 --> 12:54.432
Lou, no. I have work
piling up around the ranch!

12:54.466 --> 12:56.133
I can't spend my whole weekend babysitting!

12:56.168 --> 12:58.169
So get Ty to help you out.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.470
Come on, Amy, think of it like a trial run.

12:59.537 --> 13:01.738
Parenting 101.

13:01.806 --> 13:03.674
Now you're really sounding
like a petroleum wife.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.542
Come on, Amy, don't be like that.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.079
It's probably gonna be so much fun.

13:08.146 --> 13:09.879
(Sighs)

13:09.913 --> 13:10.947
Lou: (Car starts up)
Don't worry, Kitty Kat,

13:11.015 --> 13:12.548
mommy's gonna be back soon, okay?

13:12.616 --> 13:14.617
Peter: Yeah, daddy too, okay? Bye!

13:14.685 --> 13:16.419
Lou: Bye, sweetheart,
have fun with grandpa!

13:16.487 --> 13:17.653
<i>Georgie: I'm sure I will.</i>

13:17.721 --> 13:19.689
- Lou: Okay, bye!
- Amy: Bye, guys.

13:19.756 --> 13:21.191
Lou: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!
Back up, back up, back up!

13:21.225 --> 13:23.360
Amy, don't forget Katie is off granola.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.462
It has to be oatmeal with
a teaspoon of maple syrup.

13:25.529 --> 13:27.029
- Amy: Okay, Lou.
- Lou: Okay.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.631
Oh, and no matter what she
says, two stories and lights out!

13:28.699 --> 13:30.132
- Amy: Okay!
- Lou: Okay, bye!

13:30.200 --> 13:32.568
- Peter: Okay.
- Lou: Okay. Bye!

13:32.636 --> 13:35.170
Lou: Oh, oh, and no ice
cream before bed! Bye!

13:35.238 --> 13:39.008
<i>Georgie: Say bye to mommy and daddy! Bye!</i>

13:39.075 --> 13:40.910
All right, Jack, let's go fishin'!

13:40.944 --> 13:42.176
What are you waiting for?

13:42.244 --> 13:43.678
Jack: Well, breakfast for starters.

13:43.746 --> 13:45.079
You don't want to scare the fish away

13:45.114 --> 13:46.915
with a grumbling stomach.

13:46.983 --> 13:48.249
Amy: (Chuckling) Come on, you two.

13:48.283 --> 13:49.150
Georgie: Alrighty!

13:51.020 --> 13:52.654
Amy: Come on, Katie, let's go!

13:52.688 --> 13:54.055
Georgie: (Laughs)

13:54.123 --> 13:54.990
(Truck rumbles)

14:03.331 --> 14:04.899
Tim: Better late than never.

14:04.933 --> 14:09.003
Tricia: Yeah, Tim, I'm sorry,
there's been a complication.

14:09.037 --> 14:11.972
<i>Jade: I'm not a complication,
mom, I'm a human being!</i>

14:12.040 --> 14:13.673
(Quietly) Did she say mom?

14:13.707 --> 14:17.243
Tricia: Yeah, that's the complication.

14:17.277 --> 14:20.547
My daughter, Jade, she just...
she turned up unexpectedly.

14:20.581 --> 14:22.148
<i>Jade: And tell your cowboy
friend that I'm not going fishing!</i>

14:22.182 --> 14:24.083
<i>You can't make me!</i>

14:24.117 --> 14:25.919
If this isn't the best time...

14:25.953 --> 14:27.921
No, she's just testing boundaries.

14:27.955 --> 14:29.121
<i>If I caved every time she gave me lip,</i>

14:29.156 --> 14:30.288
<i>where would I be?</i>

14:30.322 --> 14:32.090
<i>Jade: Back in Toronto</i>

14:32.124 --> 14:34.292
<i>and not hooking up with
some lame Roy Rogers wannabe!</i>

14:34.326 --> 14:35.627
Tricia: Okay, come on, Jade, please!

14:35.662 --> 14:37.029
Would you just... just get out of there?

14:37.063 --> 14:38.564
You get into his truck,

14:38.598 --> 14:40.265
or I'm calling your father
and sending you back!

14:40.299 --> 14:41.466
May I speak with her?

14:45.871 --> 14:48.539
Hello. Jade, is it? I'm Tim.

14:51.043 --> 14:53.110
(Quietly menacing) Get in my truck... now!

14:53.144 --> 14:53.678
Jade: Okay, okay!

14:55.681 --> 14:59.784
Don't stroke out, Roy!
(Truck door slams shut)

14:59.818 --> 15:02.552
<i>Tim: Here we go... limits
set, boundaries established.</i>

15:02.587 --> 15:05.288
I've always been very good with children.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.256
So times wasting, what are we waitin' for?

15:07.291 --> 15:08.291
I'll get the bags.

15:18.711 --> 15:21.546
Amy: Say goodbye to Georgie!
Bye, Georgie! Bye, grampa!

15:21.614 --> 15:23.281
Katie: (Whimpers)

15:23.315 --> 15:24.381
Amy: Well, Katie, what do you say?

15:24.415 --> 15:25.482
You want to go back to the house?

15:25.516 --> 15:26.516
- Katie: Mmm-hmm.
- Amy: Yeah?

15:26.585 --> 15:28.452
Katie: No.

15:28.519 --> 15:29.820
Amy: No? Well, what do you wanna do?

15:33.124 --> 15:36.126
Go back to the house just like I said.

15:36.194 --> 15:38.929
I guess you just don't want
to be told what do, huh?

15:40.764 --> 15:41.965
Maybe you're not the only one.

15:44.935 --> 15:45.735
(Dialing phone)

15:48.806 --> 15:51.808
Ty, hey, can you come over right now?

15:51.842 --> 15:52.875
Yeah, thanks. Okay.

15:57.446 --> 15:59.280
Lou: Remember that post
I did on child psychology?

15:59.348 --> 16:01.817
Maybe I could start with that.

16:01.884 --> 16:04.653
Peter: Yeah, it might feel a
little too much like school, but...

16:04.721 --> 16:08.657
Okay, what about the post on our
stay-cation at the dude ranch?

16:08.725 --> 16:10.425
- Peter: Mmm. A little personal, I think.
- (Elevator chimes)

16:10.493 --> 16:12.559
I do work with these guys, you know?

16:12.628 --> 16:16.430
Lou: Okay, not too
personal, not too serious...

16:16.498 --> 16:17.865
What are you smiling at?

16:17.933 --> 16:19.700
Peter: Nothin'. It's just been a long time

16:19.768 --> 16:20.935
since we've been anywhere
without the kids, that's all.

16:21.003 --> 16:24.471
Lou: I know. I miss them already.

16:24.506 --> 16:26.007
Peter: Yeah, but nothing
wrong with a little alone time.

16:26.074 --> 16:27.974
(Clicks elevator button)

16:28.042 --> 16:30.844
Lou: Oh, I get it... alone,
like you and me alone.

16:35.582 --> 16:38.484
Amy: Katie, here's Ty! Let's go see him!

16:38.519 --> 16:39.218
Let's go see Uncle Ty, huh?

16:42.089 --> 16:43.623
Hey.

16:43.657 --> 16:47.059
Ty: Okay, this better be good.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.161
Amy: It is. I think I've figured
out what's going on with Hotshot.

16:49.228 --> 16:50.162
You know, it's not the barrels or his teeth

16:50.229 --> 16:51.730
or anything like that.

16:51.765 --> 16:53.398
He just has a mind of his own!

16:53.466 --> 16:55.400
He doesn't want me telling him what to do!

16:55.468 --> 16:57.235
Ty: Okay, so what's your next move?

16:57.270 --> 17:00.504
Amy: Well, I need you to look after Katie.

17:00.572 --> 17:02.173
Ty: You called me all the
way out here to babysit?

17:02.207 --> 17:04.175
Amy: Come on, Ty, just
think of it as practice.

17:04.242 --> 17:06.577
You know, parenting 101. I'm
gonna go work with Hotshot!

17:06.611 --> 17:07.845
- Ty: (Sighs)
- Katie: (Babbles)

17:10.214 --> 17:13.584
<i>Lou: We are oil wives,</i>

17:13.617 --> 17:16.987
bound to the oil industry
till death do us part.

17:17.055 --> 17:17.988
Few women: (Chuckle)

17:18.056 --> 17:19.556
I don't know about you,

17:19.589 --> 17:22.192
but I never thought things
would turn out this way.

17:22.226 --> 17:23.694
<i>In fact, when I first met my husband</i>

17:23.728 --> 17:26.762
I was sort of protesting
his seismic testing site.

17:26.798 --> 17:27.597
(Nervous laugh)

17:27.631 --> 17:29.532
- Women: (Laugh)
- Oh my!

17:29.567 --> 17:32.902
Lou: But, uh, luckily we were
able to get past our differences

17:32.936 --> 17:34.093
and I fell in love.

17:34.197 --> 17:36.265
Woman: Aw.

17:36.299 --> 17:38.200
Lou: I realized he was
one of the good guys.

17:38.234 --> 17:41.070
Not that it's easy for an
oil guy to be a good guy,

17:41.104 --> 17:43.739
at least not to his wife.

17:43.774 --> 17:45.607
You all know what I'm talking about, right?

17:45.642 --> 17:48.677
Crazy schedules, ridiculous
hours and deadlines,

17:48.678 --> 17:50.945
all that stress and fatigue...

17:51.446 --> 17:53.381
it doesn't exactly set the
mood for romance, does it?

17:53.415 --> 17:53.982
Women: (Laugh)

17:56.085 --> 17:58.286
All right, Hotshot, you
ready to have some fun?

17:58.320 --> 18:00.155
Come on! (Clucks tongue)

18:00.189 --> 18:01.690
(Hotshot snorts)

18:01.724 --> 18:03.424
There he goes! See that, Katie?

18:03.458 --> 18:04.825
<i>Amy: (Clucks tongue)</i>

18:04.859 --> 18:07.061
Come on! Look at him! He knows the pattern!

18:07.095 --> 18:09.229
He just doesn't want to be told!

18:09.263 --> 18:10.497
Katie: (Giggles)

18:10.531 --> 18:11.431
Ty: Oh, he's picking up speed!

18:11.465 --> 18:12.132
(Laughs)

18:14.335 --> 18:16.436
Nice work!

18:16.470 --> 18:16.970
Amy: (Laughing)

18:19.174 --> 18:21.574
<i>Lou: Don't get me wrong, I love my husband,</i>

18:21.608 --> 18:23.509
<i>and although I may not love everything</i>

18:23.543 --> 18:25.078
<i>about the oil industry...</i>

18:25.145 --> 18:27.646
Peter: Uh, I'll catch up with you guys.

18:27.681 --> 18:29.215
<i>Lou: ... I respect the need
for it. Because, I mean,</i>

18:29.249 --> 18:31.718
<i>it can be tough on our
husbands, don't you think,</i>

18:31.752 --> 18:34.486
<i>always being dubbed the bad guy?</i>

18:34.554 --> 18:36.287
<i>'Cause it's one thing if you
do something obviously good,</i>

18:36.322 --> 18:39.324
<i>like being a doctor, a teacher,</i>

18:39.358 --> 18:41.126
<i>a firefighter, a yoga instructor.</i>

18:41.194 --> 18:42.493
<i>Women: (Laugh)</i>

18:42.561 --> 18:43.695
<i>Lou: But when you're an oil guy,</i>

18:43.730 --> 18:45.630
it's like you're personally responsible

18:45.664 --> 18:47.498
for the destruction of
life on earth as we know it.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.601
<i>Women: (Laugh)</i>

18:49.635 --> 18:51.036
<i>Lou: And I mean, let's face
it, you can only be in denial</i>

18:51.070 --> 18:53.838
about the whole toxic emissions
and global warming thing

18:53.872 --> 18:56.941
for so long, right?

18:57.008 --> 18:59.276
<i>But, in my experience, when an oil guy</i>

18:59.344 --> 19:01.712
gets past that denial stage

19:01.747 --> 19:06.150
and actually starts facing
these big oil issues head on,

19:06.218 --> 19:08.218
they can quickly move from
being part of the problem

19:08.285 --> 19:10.653
to being part of the solution.

19:10.721 --> 19:13.757
<i>So, I mean, maybe the oil industry</i>

19:13.824 --> 19:15.792
is a little like a marriage.

19:15.860 --> 19:18.728
First you admit there's a problem, right?

19:18.796 --> 19:20.429
<i>And then, you know,
maybe show a little love,</i>

19:20.497 --> 19:22.999
spend a little money,

19:23.067 --> 19:25.134
take your wife on an
all-expenses-paid vacation

19:25.201 --> 19:27.469
to Fort McMurray?

19:27.503 --> 19:28.070
Women: (Laugh)

19:29.973 --> 19:31.740
Something's wrong with that picture.

19:31.808 --> 19:33.008
(Truck rumbles)

19:42.350 --> 19:43.617
Jack: Okay, here we are!

19:48.623 --> 19:49.857
Awesome! (Door slams shut)

19:54.529 --> 19:58.331
Come on, Jack, hurry up! This is perfect!

19:58.399 --> 20:00.433
Jack: (Chuckles) Yeah.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.235
I bet we'll catch lots of fish!

20:05.572 --> 20:06.739
Jack?

20:06.808 --> 20:08.074
Jack: Yeah?

20:08.109 --> 20:09.109
Georgie: Is someone already here?

20:09.143 --> 20:10.510
<i>Jack: What do you mean?</i>

20:10.544 --> 20:12.077
Well, the door's open and
there's a bag on the porch.

20:12.112 --> 20:14.013
(Bag thumps)

20:14.047 --> 20:14.880
You stay there!

20:22.355 --> 20:24.523
Who are you and what are you doin' here?

20:24.557 --> 20:27.426
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

20:27.460 --> 20:30.795
I'm Jack Bartlett. This
is my fishing cabin.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.731
Now it's your turn and
you better make it good!

20:33.765 --> 20:36.201
I'm Jade. Jade Virani.
I'm here with my mom.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.236
Virani?

20:38.270 --> 20:41.539
Doctor Virani? Well, where's she?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.541
Jade: She's fishing with
her stupid new boyfriend!

20:43.575 --> 20:44.808
Jack: Boyfriend?

20:44.843 --> 20:46.710
Jade: Yeah, Tony... Tom...

20:48.179 --> 20:49.612
Jack: Tim?

20:49.647 --> 20:52.216
<i>Jade: Yeah, that's it.</i>

20:52.250 --> 20:53.951
Jack: Both of you, you stay put!

20:59.790 --> 21:01.190
What are you lookin' at?

21:05.095 --> 21:06.695
<i>Ty: (Quietly) Nothing beats a midday nap.</i>

21:06.730 --> 21:09.866
That's right, Katie.

21:09.900 --> 21:13.202
(Exaggerated yawn) We're all going
to sleep now, just closing our eyes...

21:13.237 --> 21:14.303
(Door squeaks shut)

21:16.538 --> 21:17.638
(Whispering) Finally.

21:19.041 --> 21:19.741
Amy?

21:22.979 --> 21:25.113
I'm in here.

21:25.147 --> 21:27.482
Hey, where are you going?

21:27.516 --> 21:30.785
I'm gonna go work with Hotshot some more.

21:30.819 --> 21:32.719
(Whispering) We just got Katie to sleep.

21:32.754 --> 21:35.055
We got the whole place to ourselves.

21:35.123 --> 21:36.023
- Okay...
- I think your priorities

21:36.091 --> 21:36.957
are a little out of whack?

21:36.992 --> 21:38.492
What do you want to do?

21:38.559 --> 21:39.894
<i>- Well...
- Katie: Ty!</i>

21:42.730 --> 21:44.999
I think you should
probably go check on her.

21:45.033 --> 21:47.234
Why don't you go check on her this time?

21:47.269 --> 21:48.834
<i>Katie: Ty!</i>

21:48.903 --> 21:51.137
No, she really wants you,

21:51.171 --> 21:52.471
and I've got work to do, okay?

21:52.539 --> 21:53.439
Okay.

21:53.473 --> 21:54.440
Hey, thank you.

21:57.844 --> 21:59.879
<i>Katie: Ty!</i>

21:59.947 --> 22:01.915
Ty: All right, Katie, here I come!

22:01.982 --> 22:04.383
(Light tap)

22:04.450 --> 22:06.618
Tim: Okay, it's all about
rhythm. Just take it back...

22:06.685 --> 22:08.820
Tricia: Okay...

22:08.888 --> 22:10.555
- Tim: Wait, then take it through...
- (Fishing line whips)

22:10.623 --> 22:11.423
Not bad, not bad.

22:13.993 --> 22:15.427
Jade: What are you guys
even doing out here?

22:15.494 --> 22:18.596
Georgie: You know, fishing.

22:18.664 --> 22:22.466
Jade: Fishing with your
grandfather? Kill me now!

22:22.534 --> 22:24.001
Man, I can't believe I'm stuck out here!

22:24.069 --> 22:25.536
No TV, no Internet, no nothing!

22:30.108 --> 22:33.144
Georgie: Well, Jack said there
was some board games in the cabin.

22:33.211 --> 22:35.346
Jade: Board games? I'm
bored enough as it is.

22:35.414 --> 22:35.946
The last thing I need is board games!

22:37.915 --> 22:39.182
(Fishing line whips)

22:39.250 --> 22:40.283
Tim: That's perfect!

22:40.351 --> 22:42.052
Tricia: Woo!

22:42.086 --> 22:43.320
Tim: And that's right
where the big fish are,

22:43.354 --> 22:45.388
so you hang onto that.
I'm gonna get my rod.

22:45.456 --> 22:46.522
Tricia: (Laughing)

22:46.557 --> 22:47.790
Tim: Lookin' good!

22:47.858 --> 22:48.891
Tricia: The thing that worries me

22:48.960 --> 22:50.726
is what happens if I catch a fish?

22:50.761 --> 22:51.194
Tim: (Laughing)

22:53.396 --> 22:54.696
<i>Jack: The way he's teaching you to cast,</i>

22:54.764 --> 22:56.731
that's the least of your worries.

22:56.799 --> 22:58.700
<i>Tricia: Jack!</i>

22:58.768 --> 23:01.136
I didn't expect to see you here!

23:01.204 --> 23:02.237
Why not? It's my cabin.

23:04.441 --> 23:08.109
<i>Tricia: Oh, I thought this was your place?</i>

23:08.143 --> 23:10.144
I'd, I'd heard that Georgie
was going up to Banff,

23:10.179 --> 23:11.679
so I just assumed...

23:11.746 --> 23:13.647
<i>Jack: Well, you assumed wrong</i>

23:13.715 --> 23:15.316
and she's been countin' on this trip!

23:15.351 --> 23:16.717
Yeah, well, it's a big river, Jack.

23:16.751 --> 23:19.187
It's not big enough!

23:19.221 --> 23:22.156
<i>Tricia: Okay, Jack, look,
this is all my fault.</i>

23:22.191 --> 23:23.591
I pressured Tim into it.

23:26.227 --> 23:27.594
(Quietly to Tim) I think we should go.

23:27.628 --> 23:29.662
<i>Tim: Yeah, okay, fine.</i>

23:29.730 --> 23:31.898
Yeah, we'll go.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.233
<i>You can have the river all to yourself.</i>

23:33.267 --> 23:34.134
Make you happy?

23:36.437 --> 23:38.438
Jack, I'm sorry about this.

23:38.473 --> 23:40.572
<i>No, I... really I am.</i>

23:44.544 --> 23:45.244
(Sighs)

23:54.721 --> 23:56.187
<i>Lisa: (Laughter echoes)</i>

23:56.222 --> 23:58.523
I didn't know fishing was a team sport.

23:58.557 --> 23:59.690
Jack: Me neither. (Gasps)

23:59.725 --> 24:01.426
Stick it in,

24:01.460 --> 24:05.196
follow the line down with
the tip of your rod...

24:05.231 --> 24:07.098
You just caught yourself a fish!

24:07.133 --> 24:08.333
Lisa: Oh really?! Did I?!

24:08.367 --> 24:09.200
- Jack: (Laughing)
- Yes, you did!

24:09.235 --> 24:09.967
Lisa: Ahh! (Laughs)

24:11.904 --> 24:13.937
<i>Jack in past: Okay, there you go!</i>

24:18.743 --> 24:20.411
(Sighs)

24:20.445 --> 24:22.646
Did you guys even bring anything to eat?

24:22.680 --> 24:24.748
Georgie: Well, there's some
stuff in the back of truck...

24:24.782 --> 24:25.982
a cooler, drinks.

24:27.818 --> 24:28.584
Jade: All right.

24:30.487 --> 24:32.121
Ah, life in the boonies!

24:32.156 --> 24:34.257
Gramps left his keys in the ignition!

24:37.460 --> 24:40.462
- (Truck starts up)
- Hey! What are you doing?!

24:40.530 --> 24:42.431
Going for a ride. You wanna come?

24:42.465 --> 24:45.133
No! You can't! Jack would never let you!

24:45.168 --> 24:46.801
Give me the keys!

24:46.835 --> 24:47.869
Jade: I thought you didn't wanna come.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.071
- Georgie: I don't!
- (Tires spin)

24:49.138 --> 24:50.705
- Georgie: Hey! Stop! Stop!
- Jade: Hold on!

24:50.739 --> 24:51.339
(Truck roars)

24:55.077 --> 24:55.943
Tim: Well, maybe when we get back to town,

24:55.977 --> 24:57.678
we can go out for a bite.

24:57.712 --> 24:59.246
That way the day won't
be a total write off.

24:59.281 --> 25:00.781
Jack: Tim! Tricia!

25:00.848 --> 25:02.383
- Tricia: How bout fish and chips?
- Tim: Oh, that's funny.

25:02.451 --> 25:04.818
Jack: Hold up there! Hold up!

25:04.852 --> 25:07.321
You know, I've been
thinking and you're right;

25:07.389 --> 25:08.821
it is a big river,

25:08.889 --> 25:10.957
there's plenty of room for everybody.

25:11.024 --> 25:12.825
So, Georgie and I, we'll just...

25:14.728 --> 25:15.861
Where are those kids?

25:17.931 --> 25:20.300
And where is my truck?! Georgie!

25:20.367 --> 25:21.934
Tricia: Oh my God, Jade!

25:22.002 --> 25:23.369
(Truck roars and thumps)

25:23.437 --> 25:24.869
<i>Georgie: Don't! Stop!</i>

25:24.937 --> 25:27.439
<i>- (Tires slide and screech)
- No!</i>

25:27.474 --> 25:29.575
Jack: Georgie!

25:29.642 --> 25:31.376
Tricia: She sorta... she sometimes...
she does things like this!

25:34.247 --> 25:35.947
Jack: Give me your keys!

25:36.015 --> 25:37.182
I'll see if I can track 'em down!

25:37.250 --> 25:38.350
Tim: Okay, good idea. (Keys clink)

25:38.418 --> 25:39.585
We'll wait here in case they come back!

25:39.652 --> 25:40.118
Jack: Okay!

25:42.687 --> 25:44.688
<i>Georgie: Please! Stop!</i>

25:44.756 --> 25:46.157
(Truck roars and skids)

25:49.595 --> 25:51.862
Tim: Just take it easy on the gravel, Jack!

25:51.930 --> 25:53.231
It's a very powerful truck!

26:00.617 --> 26:02.185
<i>Nicole: Hey, uh, Caleb,</i>

26:02.253 --> 26:04.353
if you wanna take off, I don't mind.

26:06.522 --> 26:07.789
Caleb: Are you sure? 'Cause, I mean,

26:07.824 --> 26:10.092
I really don't mind sticking around.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.794
Nicole: No, no, it's
okay, really. I mean...

26:12.863 --> 26:15.865
But thank you for everything, it's uh...

26:15.899 --> 26:19.601
It was great having you here.

26:19.635 --> 26:23.004
So I hope you don't mind
if I can pay you in cash?

26:23.038 --> 26:24.272
What are you talking about paying me?

26:24.306 --> 26:25.773
Come on, Caleb,

26:25.807 --> 26:27.141
I wasn't gonna have you work for nothing.

26:27.176 --> 26:28.977
You think I did this for the money, Nicole?

26:29.011 --> 26:31.246
You think I'm that hard up?

26:31.313 --> 26:33.614
Okay, look, no. Sorry, I just...

26:33.648 --> 26:35.683
I feel bad about taking
advantage of you like this.

26:35.717 --> 26:37.918
And I feel bad taking your money.

26:37.952 --> 26:40.488
I'm a professional rodeo cowboy.

26:40.522 --> 26:42.256
I got a drawer full of
buckles, a sweet set of wheels.

26:42.290 --> 26:45.192
On a good day, I make a whole
lot more than you got there.

26:45.226 --> 26:47.127
Nah, you just forget it.

26:47.161 --> 26:49.663
Hey! Caleb, wait!

26:54.201 --> 26:55.268
Tricia: I guess you must be wondering

26:55.302 --> 26:57.904
why I never told anyone about Jade?

26:57.938 --> 26:59.873
Tim: Well, I guess you had your reasons.

26:59.907 --> 27:02.609
I wasn't exactly straight up with you

27:02.643 --> 27:04.778
when I said this was my fishing cabin.

27:04.812 --> 27:07.179
It's not. It's Jack's fishing cabin.

27:07.214 --> 27:09.147
Tricia: Yeah, well, I didn't
expect her to show up so soon.

27:09.181 --> 27:11.717
I guess my husband had enough

27:11.751 --> 27:13.519
and the next thing I knew
there was a knock on my door.

27:13.553 --> 27:15.421
Wait a second, back up.
You have a husband too?

27:15.455 --> 27:17.790
Ex-husband.

27:17.824 --> 27:18.924
My marriage ended a few months back.

27:22.429 --> 27:24.829
Actually, it was over long before that.

27:24.863 --> 27:27.097
It was my fault. I was...

27:27.132 --> 27:29.066
I was never home, I was always working.

27:29.100 --> 27:32.069
I slept at the hospital,
ate at the hospital...

27:32.137 --> 27:34.104
You ate at the hospital?
You must have been desperate.

27:34.139 --> 27:34.972
(Chuckles)

27:37.042 --> 27:40.044
Yeah, well, my marriage
wasn't the only casualty.

27:42.747 --> 27:46.716
I mean, Jadie was always a difficult child.

27:46.751 --> 27:49.453
It got worse after the divorce.

27:49.487 --> 27:50.219
Tim: It always does.

27:52.590 --> 27:54.257
Trust me, I know all about it.

27:57.661 --> 27:59.194
Tricia: I guess I thought
I could leave it all behind

27:59.262 --> 28:00.629
by moving out here. (Emotional inhale)

28:02.566 --> 28:04.700
(Tearful laugh)

28:04.734 --> 28:06.936
Must run in the family.

28:07.003 --> 28:09.404
Jade, I mean, what,
she's only been here a day

28:09.439 --> 28:11.340
and already she's trying to get away?

28:11.374 --> 28:12.740
(Tearful exhale)

28:17.480 --> 28:18.412
Catch it!

28:18.481 --> 28:19.881
(Giggles)

28:19.949 --> 28:21.282
Good job!

28:21.350 --> 28:22.049
(Grunts)

28:24.119 --> 28:25.419
Okay, Amy, I think we
need to slow down now.

28:25.488 --> 28:27.288
Katie: (Giggles)

28:27.322 --> 28:28.289
Amy: No, I think we should
just let her wear herself out

28:28.323 --> 28:30.524
until she wants to go to bed.

28:30.592 --> 28:31.592
Ty: I don't think she's
wearing herself out.

28:31.659 --> 28:33.527
I think she's winding herself up

28:33.595 --> 28:34.728
and she's never gonna
sleep if she keeps going.

28:34.796 --> 28:35.562
<i>Katie: (Giggles)</i>

28:35.630 --> 28:36.930
Okay, how about this?

28:36.998 --> 28:38.465
You keep an eye on her,

28:38.533 --> 28:40.801
and I'll go do night check on the horses.

28:40.835 --> 28:41.802
Wait a second.

28:41.836 --> 28:42.569
What?

28:44.505 --> 28:45.738
You see what you just did there?

28:45.772 --> 28:47.907
No.

28:47.975 --> 28:50.075
Every time you get tired or bored,

28:50.143 --> 28:51.210
you think of something
else you can be doing

28:51.277 --> 28:52.311
and you hand Katie off to me

28:52.379 --> 28:54.246
expecting me to deal with her.

28:54.314 --> 28:55.781
Is this gonna work when we have kids?

28:55.816 --> 28:57.449
We'll figure something out.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.318
I'm sure we will,

28:59.352 --> 29:01.119
but I know I'm gonna be a vet

29:01.186 --> 29:02.420
and I might not be able
to pick up the slack

29:02.454 --> 29:03.889
when you feel like walking away.

29:03.923 --> 29:05.089
Amy: Ty, it's not like that.

29:05.157 --> 29:06.625
All right.

29:06.659 --> 29:08.493
How about we change things up a bit?

29:08.561 --> 29:09.961
I'll go check on the
horses, you watch Katie.

29:10.029 --> 29:12.096
No, that's not fair!

29:12.131 --> 29:13.498
You're doing it right now, Amy.

29:13.533 --> 29:13.999
(Sighs) Oh...

29:16.168 --> 29:16.834
Ty...

29:18.970 --> 29:21.171
<i>Katie: (Giggles)</i>

29:21.205 --> 29:23.407
Okay, Katie, bedtime?

29:23.441 --> 29:24.675
Katie: (Whines)

29:26.377 --> 29:26.810
Amy: You're sleepy.

29:41.258 --> 29:43.292
Ty: Hey, Amy! Come check this out!

29:47.698 --> 29:48.964
I knew you wouldn't ditch me.

29:56.873 --> 29:58.173
<i>Ty: What he's doing?</i>

29:59.709 --> 30:00.208
Doing what he does.

30:05.827 --> 30:06.886
His job.

30:14.155 --> 30:15.656
<i>Georgie: Please, stop!</i>

30:15.691 --> 30:17.224
<i>You don't even know how to drive!</i>

30:17.258 --> 30:18.525
Jade: (Truck revs) I've
been driving for years!

30:18.560 --> 30:21.227
<i>Grand Theft Auto, Toxic
Taxi, Gran Turismo...</i>

30:21.261 --> 30:23.262
<i>Georgie: Those are all video games!</i>

30:23.330 --> 30:25.465
<i>Jade: So?! The basic
principle's still the same!</i>

30:25.499 --> 30:26.733
<i>Georgie: No, it isn't!</i>

30:29.336 --> 30:30.136
(Elevator chimes)

30:37.677 --> 30:38.944
- Peter: Lou!
- Lou: Oh, hey!

30:41.281 --> 30:42.248
How'd the talk go?

30:42.316 --> 30:43.449
It went okay.

30:43.517 --> 30:45.184
Mmm-hmm. Just okay?

30:45.252 --> 30:47.052
Well, maybe a little better than okay.

30:47.087 --> 30:47.987
They seemed to like the part about oil guys

30:48.021 --> 30:50.022
being in denial though, huh?

30:53.926 --> 30:55.627
Okay, I didn't know you were listening.

30:55.661 --> 30:56.961
I was just passing by in the corridor.

30:57.029 --> 30:57.996
Well, you know, I can't talk

30:58.063 --> 30:59.598
about being married to an oil guy

30:59.632 --> 31:01.064
without taking a couple
jabs at the industry.

31:01.099 --> 31:02.833
What? Why not? Ho...

31:02.867 --> 31:04.468
Why not, Lou?! We're in Fort McMurray,

31:04.536 --> 31:06.170
in a hotel full of people I work with...

31:06.238 --> 31:08.239
people I work for!

31:08.273 --> 31:09.340
Yeah, great time to diss the oil industry!

31:09.407 --> 31:10.941
I did not diss anything!

31:10.975 --> 31:12.709
I raised some interesting talking points

31:12.777 --> 31:14.911
and the discussion
afterwards was very positive!

31:14.979 --> 31:16.046
- If...
- You know what? They invited me here

31:16.080 --> 31:17.046
'cause they thought you were gonna tell

31:17.080 --> 31:18.881
some funny stories about babies!

31:18.949 --> 31:20.583
That's what you really think
my blog is about, don't you?

31:20.651 --> 31:22.118
You know what? If you want to post stories

31:22.186 --> 31:24.020
about our life on the
Internet that's fine, okay?

31:24.087 --> 31:25.821
But when you put me down
in front of my colleagues?

31:25.889 --> 31:26.856
They weren't your colleagues,

31:26.890 --> 31:28.158
they were your colleagues' wives!

31:28.225 --> 31:29.825
This is not a joke, Lou! This is my job!

31:29.860 --> 31:31.761
Oh, trust me, I know!

31:31.828 --> 31:32.694
What is that supposed to mean?

31:32.762 --> 31:33.862
It means ever since we met,

31:33.929 --> 31:36.097
it has been work first, life second!

31:36.166 --> 31:37.832
Wow, I can't believe you're saying that.

31:37.900 --> 31:39.468
You know, I go to work so
I can support this family!

31:39.536 --> 31:40.769
Oh, so now we're talking about money?!

31:40.836 --> 31:42.204
Well, we aren't talking
about babies, are we?

31:42.272 --> 31:43.505
You know what? Don't you dare say one...

31:43.573 --> 31:45.574
(elevator hums and rumbles, thumps loudly)

31:47.710 --> 31:48.243
Lou: What happened?

31:50.046 --> 31:52.180
Peter: Blew a fuse or something.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.782
That's great.

31:53.849 --> 31:57.052
(Truck roars and skids)

31:57.119 --> 31:59.954
<i>Georgie: Stop the truck!
You're going off the road!</i>

32:00.022 --> 32:02.691
<i>(Loud thump) Look out!</i>

32:02.758 --> 32:04.858
(Truck roars and skids, Georgie screams)

32:04.926 --> 32:07.828
(Truck grinds to a halt)

32:07.896 --> 32:08.696
(Engine hisses)

32:14.513 --> 32:15.779
Georgie: (Exhales tensely)

32:22.454 --> 32:23.221
Jade: You okay?

32:23.255 --> 32:24.388
What do you think?

32:26.524 --> 32:28.925
Jade: Well, that was
fun... while it lasted.

32:31.028 --> 32:34.964
Are you kidding me? Fun?!
Jack is going to kill you!

32:34.998 --> 32:36.600
That would make my mom really freak out.

32:36.634 --> 32:38.235
What?

32:38.302 --> 32:40.604
Well, you know, she's always busy.

32:40.638 --> 32:43.239
You know, she's always
got better things to do.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.558
And I wouldn't even be here,

32:44.559 --> 32:46.908
if my dad's new girlfriend
wasn't so unbearable!

32:46.943 --> 32:48.244
So what happened?

32:48.278 --> 32:49.545
I fly halfway across the country

32:49.579 --> 32:52.080
and she won't even change her plans!

32:52.115 --> 32:53.649
You know what? I'm outta here.

32:53.683 --> 32:55.083
Georgie: Where are you going?

32:55.118 --> 32:58.153
Jade: Anywhere! Anywhere's
better than here!

32:58.187 --> 33:00.722
Georgie: Well, you can't just
leave! We have to go back!

33:00.756 --> 33:02.557
Trust me, when stuff like this happens,

33:02.591 --> 33:03.758
leaving is the only way to go!

33:08.964 --> 33:09.797
(Sighs heavily)

33:13.636 --> 33:14.735
Peter: This is getting ridiculous.

33:14.802 --> 33:17.971
Lou: (Sighs) Oh really? You think so?

33:18.005 --> 33:19.373
Peter: What are you doing?

33:19.407 --> 33:23.710
Lou: I'm looking for the
intercom. Hello? Hello?

33:23.745 --> 33:25.712
<i>Front desk guy: Front
desk, how can I help you?</i>

33:25.747 --> 33:27.080
Lou: Can you help us?

33:27.114 --> 33:28.515
We are stuck in your damn elevator!

33:28.549 --> 33:30.750
You can turn on the lights
and get us outta here!

33:30.784 --> 33:32.618
<i>Front desk guy: Please calm down, ma'am.</i>

33:32.686 --> 33:34.720
<i>You're not in any immediate danger.</i>

33:34.755 --> 33:36.088
<i>Our maintenance staff are already on scene</i>

33:36.122 --> 33:38.056
<i>to assess the problem.</i>

33:38.124 --> 33:41.026
Peter: Oh, yeah, that's great.
When do you think that'll be?

33:41.094 --> 33:42.961
<i>Front desk guy: Based on last week,</i>

33:43.029 --> 33:45.063
<i>it shouldn't be more
than two or three hours.</i>

33:45.098 --> 33:47.666
<i>May I have your name please, sir?</i>

33:47.733 --> 33:51.303
Peter: Yeah, it's Peter Morris.
I'm in room seven sixteen.

33:51.370 --> 33:53.271
<i>Front desk guy: Well,
good news, Mr. Morris,</i>

33:53.339 --> 33:55.473
<i>I see your room is already taken care of,</i>

33:55.541 --> 33:58.610
<i>so how about we comp you
a breakfast buffet for two?</i>

33:58.644 --> 34:00.077
Peter: Oh, fantastic!

34:00.112 --> 34:02.979
You think we'll be outta here by then?

34:03.047 --> 34:06.383
<i>Front desk guy: I'm sorry,
is that a joke, Mr. Morris?</i>

34:08.252 --> 34:09.985
Peter: (Sighs heavily)

34:10.021 --> 34:11.455
Do you believe this guy?
We're stuck in an elevator

34:11.489 --> 34:14.157
and he's offering us a breakfast buffet?

34:14.192 --> 34:17.828
Lou: Actually, I heard the
breakfast buffet's is quite good.

34:19.763 --> 34:20.563
(Truck rumbles)

34:22.800 --> 34:25.266
Georgie: Jack!

34:25.335 --> 34:27.036
Jack: What the heck is going on here?!

34:28.505 --> 34:31.940
I am so sorry!

34:32.007 --> 34:35.176
That girl, Jade, she saw your keys

34:35.244 --> 34:36.545
and I didn't know what to do!

34:36.612 --> 34:38.380
That's okay, it's okay.
I'm just glad I found you.

34:38.447 --> 34:40.882
You're not hurt, are ya?

34:40.916 --> 34:42.484
Okay. So where is she and how did my truck

34:42.552 --> 34:43.117
end up in the ditch?

34:45.487 --> 34:48.188
<i>Georgie: I don't know,
she was going too fast!</i>

34:48.257 --> 34:49.157
I should never have gotten in the truck!

34:49.190 --> 34:50.623
Well, yeah, that is for sure,

34:50.692 --> 34:53.360
but at least you're safe.

34:53.428 --> 34:56.263
But I let her do it and
that means it's my fault!

34:56.297 --> 35:00.033
<i>Jade: Okay, come on, let's get
real, this was completely my fault.</i>

35:00.101 --> 35:02.737
She had nothing to do with it,

35:02.804 --> 35:04.739
<i>and when you see my mom
make sure you tell her that.</i>

35:04.773 --> 35:06.773
Georgie, get in the truck.

35:06.807 --> 35:09.141
This one and I need to have a chat.

35:09.176 --> 35:11.310
Look, I'm sorry about borrowing your truck.

35:11.379 --> 35:13.813
Borrowing? Is that what you call it?

35:13.848 --> 35:15.348
And taking Georgie with ya?

35:15.383 --> 35:17.016
What's going on in your head?!

35:17.050 --> 35:18.585
I didn't... I... I don't know.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.888
What, that's the best you got?

35:21.955 --> 35:23.355
Well, you got a better theory?!

35:25.191 --> 35:26.658
You'd do just about anything

35:26.693 --> 35:28.394
to get under your mother's skin!

35:28.428 --> 35:30.596
Wow! You got it first try!

35:30.630 --> 35:33.532
Well, guess what? It works every time.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.300
So look, again, I'm sorry about your truck.

35:35.334 --> 35:38.603
Sorry? I've been hearin' that a lot.

35:38.670 --> 35:39.970
Well, you're gonna apologize
your way through life?!

35:40.005 --> 35:42.473
No!

35:42.508 --> 35:44.876
I don't know, I guess not.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.611
What else do I say?

35:46.645 --> 35:48.045
Well, it ain't the sayin' that counts,

35:48.079 --> 35:51.382
it's the doin' and you
keep doin' stuff like this,

35:51.417 --> 35:52.884
pretty soon people won't give a damn

35:52.918 --> 35:54.385
how sorry you say you are!

35:54.419 --> 35:55.852
What is this?

35:55.887 --> 35:57.487
Some sort of backwoods teaching moment?!

35:57.522 --> 35:59.790
You call it whatever you want!

35:59.824 --> 36:02.793
And we're not done, so
you get in the truck now!

36:05.963 --> 36:07.130
(Door slams shut)

36:07.164 --> 36:09.332
(Cell phone beeps)

36:09.366 --> 36:12.035
Okay, maybe you're right.
I got a little carried away.

36:12.069 --> 36:13.937
(Cell phone beeps)

36:13.971 --> 36:16.139
And I overreacted a little bit.

36:16.173 --> 36:17.773
But, honey, if you had
heard the rest of my speech,

36:17.808 --> 36:19.909
you would know it wasn't
really about you at all.

36:19.944 --> 36:22.946
Peter: Oh, I know, I know,
I just... you know, I got mad

36:22.980 --> 36:25.982
and I just said the first
thing that came into mind.

36:26.016 --> 36:27.524
Kinda like me and my speech.

36:27.525 --> 36:30.118
Yeah, except that when...
you say the first thing

36:30.119 --> 36:31.686
that comes into your mind, it's...

36:33.556 --> 36:35.657
You're a very intelligent woman, Lou,

36:35.724 --> 36:38.860
<i>and although I may not
always like what you say,</i>

36:38.928 --> 36:40.228
I do like the way you say it.

36:42.098 --> 36:44.565
You know, and you being incredibly hot

36:44.632 --> 36:47.501
does not exactly leave me cold.

36:47.569 --> 36:49.370
Mr. Morris, that sounds
like a come on line.

36:49.404 --> 36:51.772
(Whispering) Ah, guess what, it is.

36:51.806 --> 36:53.507
Really? What do you think you're doing?

36:53.541 --> 36:55.275
Hmm... hmm? What?

36:55.309 --> 36:56.577
Peter: We got a couple hours,

36:56.644 --> 36:59.546
let's make the most of our alone time.

36:59.614 --> 37:00.581
Lou: (Chuckles)

37:00.648 --> 37:02.048
(Cell phone clatters)

37:07.821 --> 37:09.922
(Horse whinnies on video, gate clanks open)

37:09.990 --> 37:11.323
(Horse whinnies on video)

37:14.528 --> 37:18.030
<i>Announcer on video: Lookin' real
good! A solid run! Caleb Odell!</i>

37:18.098 --> 37:21.000
<i>Goin' the eight seconds right there!</i>

<i>And that's him down!</i>

37:22.668 --> 37:25.604
<i>The judges say 78 points for Caleb Odell!</i>

Tricia: Oh, thank God!

37:34.313 --> 37:37.181
Jade: Hi, mom. Roy. Catch any fish?

37:37.249 --> 37:38.682
How you doin', kid? Everything okay?

37:38.717 --> 37:40.218
Georgie: Yeah, I'm okay.

37:40.285 --> 37:41.652
Tricia: What were you thinking, huh?!

37:41.720 --> 37:42.887
You are in big trouble, young lady!

37:42.954 --> 37:44.355
I'm really sorry, mom.

37:47.893 --> 37:49.960
No, I'm not sorry, actually, I...

37:50.029 --> 37:52.430
I'm gonna stop staying that.

37:52.498 --> 37:55.798
<i>I just, I don't know, I guess...</i>

37:55.866 --> 37:57.567
I'll try harder, mom.

37:57.635 --> 38:00.837
Oh baby, I was so worried!

38:00.905 --> 38:03.640
Tim: So it's all good except
what happened to your truck?

38:03.674 --> 38:06.043
Jack: Well, it's in a ditch five miles up,

38:06.077 --> 38:08.745
so I'm gonna need a tow. (Keys clink)

38:08.779 --> 38:10.146
Tim: Okay.

38:10.213 --> 38:12.081
Jade: It was a really dumb thing to do.

38:12.149 --> 38:14.517
Tim: What do you say, girls?

38:14.551 --> 38:15.584
I'm gonna help Jack get
his truck outta the ditch

38:15.652 --> 38:17.786
<i>and then we'll hit the road,</i>

38:17.854 --> 38:19.055
get back in town in time
for me to take you up

38:19.089 --> 38:20.856
on that dinner you promised me.

38:20.890 --> 38:21.924
That'd be great.

38:23.660 --> 38:24.493
We won't overstay our welcome.

38:27.029 --> 38:27.628
Can I drive?

38:33.469 --> 38:34.969
Amy: All right, Hotshot,

38:35.037 --> 38:38.339
why don't you just take
me for a nice walk, huh?

38:38.374 --> 38:41.476
Ty: All right, no pressure.
Let's see what he can do.

38:43.911 --> 38:45.079
Amy: Good boy. (Laughs)

38:48.783 --> 38:50.517
Good boy! Look at that!

38:50.552 --> 38:51.785
He'd doing it all on his own!

38:51.819 --> 38:53.487
He doesn't need me to tell him what to do!

Amy and Ty: (Laughing)

39:10.770 --> 39:13.272
You're such a good boy!

39:13.307 --> 39:15.574
You just want to do that all on your own!

39:15.641 --> 39:18.110
Amy and Ty: (Laughing)

39:18.144 --> 39:21.679
All right, now he knows
his job, how about you?

39:21.714 --> 39:23.248
It's still your turn to put Katie to bed.

39:23.282 --> 39:25.617
Okay.

39:25.651 --> 39:27.319
Okay, Katie, time for bed.

Fantastic! Thank you!

39:40.198 --> 39:41.665
<i>Front desk guy: Have a good day!</i>

39:41.699 --> 39:42.600
Lou: That was not two or three
hours! It wasn't even close!

39:42.634 --> 39:43.501
Peter: (Laughing) I know!

39:43.568 --> 39:44.835
What do you want me to do?

39:44.902 --> 39:47.036
Lou: Honey! (Lights buzz, elevator clanks)

39:47.104 --> 39:48.571
Oh, we are moving down! We're
going... we're going down!

39:48.639 --> 39:49.639
Peter: I know! (Laughing)

39:51.242 --> 39:53.109
Lou: It's not funny!

Jack: (Chuckling)

40:30.864 --> 40:33.632
Oh, I'm no mystery really.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.934
I've never been on an
all-inclusive vacation

40:36.002 --> 40:39.170
and you couldn't pay me
to get on a cruise ship.

40:39.238 --> 40:40.605
Can I say the rest?

40:40.607 --> 40:42.406
Sure.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.510
(Clears throat) You like horses,

40:45.577 --> 40:46.711
sometimes more than the
people that ride them.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.045
(Laughs)

40:48.079 --> 40:49.313
<i>Georgie: Jack?!</i>

40:51.449 --> 40:53.050
What are you doing?!

40:53.118 --> 40:54.919
Why didn't you wake me
up? Let's get fishing!

40:54.953 --> 40:56.953
Nope. Just like I told you yesterday,

40:57.021 --> 40:58.989
breakfast first!

40:59.056 --> 41:00.089
Your grumblin' stomach...

41:00.124 --> 41:02.826
Will scare the fish away.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.761
- That's right.

Lou: Is that my big girl?!
Is that my big girl?!

41:23.212 --> 41:26.916
Come here! Come here!
Oh, I missed you so much!

41:26.950 --> 41:29.017
Oh! Oh! Look at you! You got bigger!

<i>Peter: Hi, pumpkin!</i>

41:30.352 --> 41:33.087
Lou: So you two, how was it?

41:33.155 --> 41:35.023
Ty: Great, yeah. It
was never a dull moment.

41:35.057 --> 41:37.158
Amy: Yeah, she was perfect.

41:37.192 --> 41:39.360
Amazing how little sleep she needs.

41:39.428 --> 41:41.095
Ty: How was fort Mac?

41:41.129 --> 41:44.197
Lou: It was much better than expected.

41:44.231 --> 41:45.632
Peter: Yeah, they even
comped us a breakfast buffet.

41:47.969 --> 41:50.070
Lou: Were you good? Were you good?

41:50.104 --> 41:50.804
Peter: Yes, of course you were.

41:52.874 --> 41:53.640
Jade: Excuse me?

41:55.910 --> 41:57.678
You.

41:57.712 --> 41:58.378
Don't worry, I'm not
here to cause any trouble

41:58.412 --> 42:00.379
or anything.

42:00.413 --> 42:02.281
So what are you doing here?

42:02.315 --> 42:05.651
I know you saw me take
this the other day and...

42:05.686 --> 42:06.919
I know it was really stupid.

42:06.954 --> 42:09.055
I don't know what I was thinking.

42:09.089 --> 42:11.924
Anyway, I can pay for
it, or you can let it go,

42:11.959 --> 42:13.826
or you can call the
cops, whatever you want.

42:13.860 --> 42:15.327
I don't really care.

42:18.564 --> 42:20.065
Just don't let it happen again.

42:26.271 --> 42:28.607
Okay, just don't expect too much!

42:28.641 --> 42:30.475
I switched out his tack,
got rid of the bridle,

42:30.509 --> 42:31.742
and I'm gonna ride him in a halter,

42:31.776 --> 42:34.277
but I still haven't gone at any speed yet.

42:34.312 --> 42:35.646
Caleb: Okay, enough with the
excuses! Let's just see what you got!

43:15.984 --> 43:18.919
Okay, hold that line like I showed you now!

43:18.954 --> 43:20.554
Right there. Yeah, good girl!

43:20.622 --> 43:22.356
Okay, here we go, I got the line.

43:22.390 --> 43:24.424
You reel it in just a little bit now.

43:24.492 --> 43:26.359
Keep some tension on him!
I think he's a big one!

43:26.426 --> 43:28.662
Georgie: Okay, okay.

43:28.729 --> 43:30.338
- Georgie: He's really pulling!
- Jack: Easy now.

43:30.345 --> 43:32.733
- Georgie: Can you see him?
- Jack: Look at that! He's a beaut!

43:32.735 --> 43:34.287
