00:13.858 --> 00:16.318
Man, how can people be so lazy?

00:16.318 --> 00:18.238
There are trash cans like everywhere.

00:18.288 --> 00:19.358
Maybe they didn't see them.

00:19.358 --> 00:21.338
What? You're defending these people?

00:21.338 --> 00:24.068
I suppose you enjoy being stuck out here cleaning up all this?

00:24.308 --> 00:26.888
Yeah, 'cause I found these!

00:27.788 --> 00:30.808
Wait, what are you going to do with bronze baby shoes?

00:30.838 --> 00:32.088
I don't know, I'll think of something.

00:32.088 --> 00:34.808
Wait, are you just filling your bag with cool stuff you find?!

00:34.808 --> 00:36.888
Yeah, man. People leave all sorts of junk here.

00:36.888 --> 00:38.148
You just gotta look.

00:38.148 --> 00:41.018
Man, I didn't even think to look! All I got is trash.

00:43.618 --> 00:44.768
Army dude.

00:44.908 --> 00:46.358
See? It's true what they say.

00:46.358 --> 00:48.128
One man's trash is another man's pleasure.

00:48.128 --> 00:49.398
- Treasure. - What?

00:49.428 --> 00:51.638
One man's trash is another man's treasure,

00:51.638 --> 00:53.618
not pleasure. That's just weird.

00:53.618 --> 00:56.228
Well, it's a pleasure to find treasure, so same-diff.

00:56.478 --> 00:57.328
Whatever.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.698
- Quarter! - Jinx!

00:59.818 --> 01:02.308
Yeah, this treasure's my pleasure!

01:04.068 --> 01:05.948
I said "jinx," dude! You're jinxed!

01:05.948 --> 01:08.108
Fine! You can have the quarter. Geez.

01:09.328 --> 01:09.958
Du--

01:11.578 --> 01:12.878
You know how this works, man.

01:12.878 --> 01:14.238
You can't talk when you're jinxed.

01:14.238 --> 01:16.138
And when you talk, you're gonna get punched.

01:16.138 --> 01:17.498
So keep your mouth shut.

01:18.278 --> 01:18.878
Fine.

01:23.428 --> 01:24.618
In your face.

01:26.728 --> 01:28.248
Look, dude!

01:29.708 --> 01:30.578
That's amazing!

01:33.388 --> 01:35.358
So... beautiful.

01:37.018 --> 01:38.868
Dude, check out what came for you in the mail.

01:38.868 --> 01:40.868
Aw, yeah! What is it?

01:41.218 --> 01:41.818
Totally.

01:42.268 --> 01:42.818
Nice.

01:43.418 --> 01:44.088
Come on!

01:44.988 --> 01:45.608
Can you pass the--

01:49.408 --> 01:50.528
What? What is it?

01:50.578 --> 01:51.818
You can tell me anything, dude.

01:52.568 --> 01:54.388
Dude, you know you can break the jinx

01:54.388 --> 01:56.508
just by having someone say your name three times.

01:57.008 --> 01:58.238
Wait, I didn't tell you that?

01:58.918 --> 02:01.038
Hm, I guess I didn't because everybody knows that.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.688
I was wondering why you didn't break it sooner.

02:04.408 --> 02:06.788
You better keep your mouth shut because I'll be listening!

02:06.788 --> 02:09.338
Of course all of this trash would still be here.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.098
By now Why do I even try?

02:11.768 --> 02:13.098
Hey, hey!

02:13.088 --> 02:14.988
Get over here right now!

02:17.158 --> 02:17.768
Benson!

02:17.918 --> 02:19.928
- Hey man, I need you-- - No. Stop.

02:19.928 --> 02:22.248
Don't say anything. What is that?

02:22.248 --> 02:24.328
Do You guys expect me to let this slide?

02:24.328 --> 02:26.398
No. Yes. I don't know. Look, I just need you--

02:26.398 --> 02:27.678
Uh, what you need?

02:27.678 --> 02:31.208
Well, what I need is for you to start cleaning this mess up starting now,

02:31.208 --> 02:32.328
or you're fired!

02:32.328 --> 02:33.888
Okay, okay. I'm doing it.

02:33.998 --> 02:35.938
But can you just say my name three--

02:36.298 --> 02:37.938
What? Say your name?

02:37.938 --> 02:39.788
Why do you want me to say your name?

02:40.158 --> 02:41.718
What, what are you looking at?

02:42.478 --> 02:43.678
That Mordecai!

02:43.678 --> 02:44.718
Mordecai!

02:44.718 --> 02:48.078
Mordecai, get over here this second or you're fired!

02:48.678 --> 02:51.238
What the heck, Rigby?! What's the matter with you?!

02:52.788 --> 02:53.568
Rigby!

03:03.018 --> 03:04.818
Just say my name one more time!

03:12.828 --> 03:13.958
Oh hello.

03:15.508 --> 03:17.308
Are we playing charades?

03:17.458 --> 03:18.728
Good show!

03:18.798 --> 03:21.368
I just adore parlor games,

03:21.368 --> 03:24.218
next we can play Bits and Bobbles.

03:25.158 --> 03:27.558
Ok yes, Im getting ahead of myself.

03:27.558 --> 03:28.878
Go, go!

03:30.538 --> 03:31.748
Friends till the end!

03:32.808 --> 03:34.198
Oh, dirty raccoon!

03:36.548 --> 03:37.878
3 dirty raccoons?

03:39.328 --> 03:42.058
Raccoon's brains are three times smaller than normal.

03:42.448 --> 03:43.358
No? Uh...

03:43.358 --> 03:45.198
Three out of three raccoons can't read!

03:45.878 --> 03:49.268
Oh, Mordecai, have you come to play charades with us?

03:49.378 --> 03:52.238
Not if this guy is giving the clues, he blows at this game.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.678
Pops is never gonna get it. No offense, Pops.

03:54.728 --> 03:57.838
Oh, none taken. I agree, he's terrible.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.028
Shut up! I'm good!

04:00.718 --> 04:02.348
Oh, he's jinxed!

04:02.378 --> 04:04.388
Haha, yes, you got it, Pops.

04:04.388 --> 04:06.798
I love a good jinxing.

04:12.288 --> 04:14.888
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.

04:25.488 --> 04:28.308
You know for some people, writing is talking,

04:28.308 --> 04:30.198
so you're kinda breaking the rules.

04:31.258 --> 04:33.948
Aw, I didn't even say anything.

04:33.948 --> 04:35.438
That's what you get for cheating.

04:35.438 --> 04:37.608
Sounds count too, right?

04:37.608 --> 04:39.018
Sounds totally count.

04:39.018 --> 04:40.178
Sounds count?

04:44.988 --> 04:46.168
Do you wanna follow him?

04:46.218 --> 04:47.298
Yeah, why not.

04:47.298 --> 04:49.088
I'm not doing anything right now.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.118
Gotta find somebody, gotta find somebody!

04:52.538 --> 04:53.958
Fives! You gotta help me man!

04:53.958 --> 04:55.488
You gotta say my name three times!

04:56.148 --> 04:58.958
I'm jinxed, and Mordecai is taking this way too far!

04:59.328 --> 05:01.338
You gotta say my name three times!

05:02.268 --> 05:03.628
Come on!

05:04.658 --> 05:05.888
Why not?

05:05.888 --> 05:07.648
Cause I'm jinxed too.

05:09.238 --> 05:12.088
No talking while you're jinxed, loser!

05:12.088 --> 05:13.168
Help... me.

05:13.168 --> 05:14.118
Shut your mouth!

05:14.118 --> 05:15.948
Hi Five Ghost, Hi Five Ghost, Hi Five Ghost!

05:15.948 --> 05:16.588
Hey!

05:19.028 --> 05:19.838
Dude, help me back!

05:20.368 --> 05:21.288
No, wait!

05:21.378 --> 05:23.248
Dude, what'cha do that for?

05:23.248 --> 05:25.568
I'm sorry, I'm just need to get rid of my jinx.

05:25.568 --> 05:27.668
Why don't you take it off yourself?

05:27.788 --> 05:28.718
You can do that?

05:29.168 --> 05:30.778
Yeah, it's easy.

05:30.938 --> 05:32.818
Now here's what you gotta do.

05:36.678 --> 05:38.388
Hey Muscle Man, have you seen Rigby?

05:38.488 --> 05:42.318
Yeah, I just told that loser how to unjinx himself.

05:42.418 --> 05:44.928
You didn't tell him about the mirror thing did you?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.238
Yeah I did!

05:46.238 --> 05:48.968
He's just gonna be talking to himself in the dark.

05:48.968 --> 05:50.968
It'll be hilarious!

05:52.648 --> 05:53.868
We gotta stop him.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.858
Dude, open up! Come on, let us in!

06:16.008 --> 06:18.638
No way man! You guys are just gonna hit me again.

06:18.638 --> 06:19.978
We won't I swear.

06:19.978 --> 06:22.128
You just gotta come out here and we'll break the jinx.

06:22.198 --> 06:23.738
Just break it now then.

06:23.738 --> 06:27.678
That's not how it works. It's gotta happen face to face.

06:28.298 --> 06:31.168
No dude! Muscle Man doesn't know what's talking about.

06:31.178 --> 06:32.538
Come out of there you idiot!

06:32.688 --> 06:33.658
Rigby!

06:44.918 --> 06:45.798
Rigby...

06:47.628 --> 06:48.448
Rigby...

06:49.928 --> 06:50.728
Rigby.

07:05.038 --> 07:06.308
Do you mind?

07:06.418 --> 07:08.118
I'm trying to get some reading done.

07:11.818 --> 07:14.098
Rigby, open up, Rigby!

07:18.558 --> 07:20.068
That guy's dead.

07:24.158 --> 07:26.028
That guy's not dead.

07:30.718 --> 07:31.918
Let's go, let's go!

07:46.538 --> 07:49.968
Come back here! I'm not done with you yet!

07:50.808 --> 07:52.088
Muscle Man!

07:53.758 --> 07:55.348
Dude, what is that thing?

07:55.388 --> 07:57.038
Dude, what is that thing? It's like you but evil!

07:59.238 --> 08:01.018
Ugh, I can't believe I have-

08:01.018 --> 08:03.078
There you are! Get over here and-

08:03.078 --> 08:04.288
Come with us Benson!

08:04.288 --> 08:06.478
What?! I'm not going anywhere until-

08:06.848 --> 08:07.828
Benson!

08:07.858 --> 08:08.878
Step on it!

08:10.628 --> 08:12.888
Skips, do you know what we're supposed to do?

08:12.888 --> 08:15.188
I've seen this before. You gotta-

08:15.438 --> 08:17.008
No!

08:17.128 --> 08:18.648
Skips!

08:18.648 --> 08:20.078
- Jinx! - Shut up!

08:20.078 --> 08:22.428
Wait maybe the monster will go away if I unjinx you.

08:23.528 --> 08:24.968
Stop!

08:26.438 --> 08:27.438
It's Pops!

08:27.438 --> 08:29.428
Where are you taking me?

08:29.428 --> 08:32.578
I demand you put me down at once!

08:35.238 --> 08:36.898
They see us! Go, go, go, go!

08:38.457 --> 08:40.738
You gotta do it now man! You gotta unjinx me!

08:40.738 --> 08:42.748
Alright. Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

08:45.008 --> 08:45.898
Did it work?

08:47.008 --> 08:47.898
I think so.

08:51.288 --> 08:52.758
I thought you said it worked!

08:52.758 --> 08:53.948
We're gonna die!

08:53.948 --> 08:55.008
Rigby, calm down.

08:55.148 --> 08:57.278
Think, what happened while you were in the bathroom?

08:57.278 --> 08:59.768
I said my name three times and that thing came out of the mirror!

08:59.768 --> 09:00.918
What else? What else?

09:00.918 --> 09:03.068
I locked the door, turned on the water, shut off the light.

09:03.308 --> 09:05.448
The mirror! We gotta get back to that mirror!

09:10.188 --> 09:12.088
I don't think that's gonna help man!

09:12.428 --> 09:13.028
What?

09:19.088 --> 09:20.138
Aw man.

09:20.328 --> 09:21.578
Do it dude, do it.

09:21.658 --> 09:22.918
Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

09:23.278 --> 09:24.438
Come on!

09:24.438 --> 09:26.408
They're still coming! Together!

09:26.408 --> 09:27.548
Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

09:32.538 --> 09:34.888
Rigby, Rigby, Rigby! Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

09:35.808 --> 09:36.788
Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

09:36.788 --> 09:37.788
Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

09:37.788 --> 09:39.788
Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

09:40.278 --> 09:41.538
His name's in reverse!

09:42.218 --> 09:44.018
Ybgir, Ybgir, Ybgir!

10:02.418 --> 10:03.498
Who is that?

10:03.498 --> 10:07.458
Mordecai, Rigby! You two are in so much trouble!

10:07.458 --> 10:08.238
Hey Benson.

10:08.238 --> 10:10.128
Look Benson, I can totally explain.

10:10.128 --> 10:11.118
I don't wanna hear it.

10:11.118 --> 10:14.068
I wanted that trash picked up hours ago.

10:15.898 --> 10:17.058
We're sorry Benson.

10:17.058 --> 10:18.528
Yeah, we'll do it right away.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.028
Well, alright.

10:23.888 --> 10:24.648
Hey look.

10:24.738 --> 10:27.068
How on earth did I get here?

10:27.068 --> 10:29.168
Ugh, my head.

10:29.168 --> 10:31.208
Has anyone seen my hat?

10:31.318 --> 10:33.498
Looks like you guys are off the hook.

10:33.498 --> 10:35.258
Nobody remembers anything.

10:35.358 --> 10:37.238
How come you haven't lost your memory?

10:37.428 --> 10:39.598
My mind's a steal trap.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.258
And don't do that again!

10:41.308 --> 10:42.268
We won't.

10:42.898 --> 10:44.268
Jinx, haha!

10:44.268 --> 10:46.058
Uh, eh, whatever.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.618
No talking while you're jinxed!

10:48.878 --> 10:49.978
How do you like it?!

10:50.808 --> 10:53.468
How do you like it?

10:54.148 --> 10:57.348
I feel bad for you that you'll never be able to fully enjoy this game.
