WEBVTT

00:12.874 --> 00:15.049
-Do you know what would
make me very happy?

00:15.084 --> 00:18.363
-No more detentions?

00:18.397 --> 00:20.054
-You couldn't be more wrong.

00:20.089 --> 00:24.507
I know that you think that I'm
the enemy, I don't understand.

00:24.541 --> 00:26.578
But I do.

00:26.612 --> 00:30.720
You're growing up, asserting
your independence, discovering

00:30.754 --> 00:32.308
who you really are.

00:32.342 --> 00:35.587
I just want you to fulfill
your potential instead of

00:35.621 --> 00:37.658
testing my patience.

00:37.692 --> 00:40.764
That would make me very happy.

00:40.799 --> 00:42.628
-You're very--

00:42.663 --> 00:45.183
-Perceptive.

00:45.217 --> 00:46.598
-Yes, sir.

00:46.632 --> 00:48.358
-Not a lot gets past me in
this school, Maddy Smith.

00:48.393 --> 00:51.637
You should know that by now.

00:51.672 --> 00:54.571
I've gotta go and see the
head before she leaves.

00:54.606 --> 00:58.368
You've got four minutes,
so keep working.

00:58.403 --> 00:59.542
I'll be back.

01:04.788 --> 01:07.274
-I hate it when he does that.

01:07.308 --> 01:08.413
-Does what?

01:08.447 --> 01:09.207
-Nothing gets past me
in this school.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.218
-Let's put it to the test.

01:22.944 --> 01:24.360
-What are you doing?

01:24.394 --> 01:26.569
-Let's live a little, before
we lose the moon.

01:26.603 --> 01:27.708
-What?

01:29.882 --> 01:32.402
-Maddy.

01:32.437 --> 01:33.576
-You coming, or what?

01:49.764 --> 01:50.834
-We really shouldn't
be doing this.

01:50.869 --> 01:52.112
-Why not?

02:04.952 --> 02:08.300
-Because it's dangerous.

02:08.335 --> 02:09.853
-You're beginning to remind
me of me dad.

02:21.244 --> 02:22.521
Look.

02:22.556 --> 02:24.489
That'll not be there tomorrow.

02:53.449 --> 02:55.761
-Time's up.

02:55.796 --> 02:57.315
-Haven't finished, sir.

02:57.349 --> 02:59.834
-Your detention has.

02:59.869 --> 03:00.973
Toodles.

03:12.468 --> 03:15.885
THEME SONG: A promise that I
keep, I'll never share, I'll

03:15.919 --> 03:16.851
never speak.

03:16.886 --> 03:18.957
To my grave the secret goes.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.787
The beating heart, the
beating heart.

03:21.822 --> 03:24.273
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

03:24.307 --> 03:28.656
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

03:28.691 --> 03:30.969
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

03:49.298 --> 03:51.852
-Oh, what?

03:51.886 --> 03:53.060
Mum, Dad.

03:53.094 --> 03:54.613
Mum!

03:54.648 --> 03:55.683
-What?

03:55.718 --> 03:56.788
-Can I have the day
off school?

03:56.822 --> 03:57.478
-No.

03:57.513 --> 03:58.962
-Why not?

03:58.997 --> 04:01.758
-Because one day some bright
spot's gonna realize that once

04:01.793 --> 04:05.659
a month, when there's no moon,
Maddy Smith bonks off school.

04:05.693 --> 04:06.694
And they're gonna
wanna know why.

04:06.729 --> 04:07.902
-But I'm bleeding.

04:07.937 --> 04:08.869
-Put a plaster on it.

04:08.903 --> 04:09.973
-This is so unfair.

04:10.008 --> 04:11.043
-So is life.

04:11.078 --> 04:12.355
-Are you getting up?

04:12.390 --> 04:13.529
-No.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.499
Oh, Maddy?

04:18.534 --> 04:18.947
-What now?

04:18.982 --> 04:20.293
-Come on.

04:20.329 --> 04:21.571
We'll see you when school's
finished.

04:21.606 --> 04:22.710
The closer it gets to nightfall,
the worse you'll

04:22.745 --> 04:23.401
feel.

04:23.435 --> 04:24.022
-Oh, great.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.334
Thanks a bunch.

04:33.031 --> 04:35.516
-No one told me it was
dress-down Friday.

04:35.551 --> 04:39.071
-Yeah, well, you
look horrible.

04:39.106 --> 04:40.418
-That stung.

04:40.452 --> 04:41.798
Not!

04:41.833 --> 04:43.386
-You feeling all right?

04:43.421 --> 04:44.318
-No.

04:44.353 --> 04:46.700
-What happened to your hand?

04:46.734 --> 04:49.427
-I cut it taking the bins out.

04:49.461 --> 04:50.807
-You really don't look
so good, you know.

04:50.842 --> 04:52.015
-It's probably just a bug.

05:05.374 --> 05:07.099
Didn't think you'd come in.

05:07.134 --> 05:08.342
-I tried to get out of it.

05:08.377 --> 05:09.792
But the Vaughans wouldn't
have it.

05:09.826 --> 05:12.553
-Now I know why me parents hate
no moon days so much.

05:12.588 --> 05:14.624
Feel like death.

05:14.659 --> 05:16.971
And look at this.

05:17.006 --> 05:18.904
Should have healed by now.

05:18.939 --> 05:20.872
Stupid plaster.

05:20.906 --> 05:23.081
-Yeah.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.428
Being human sucks.

05:25.463 --> 05:27.327
[laughter]

05:33.643 --> 05:35.335
-How did that even
get up there?

05:41.720 --> 05:42.859
-Yay!

05:45.862 --> 05:48.831
-Wolfbloods one, humans none.

05:48.865 --> 05:51.765
- --as a completely different
species to the chimpanzees.

05:51.799 --> 05:56.632
And yet, 98.4% of our
DNA is the same.

05:56.666 --> 05:59.531
What does that tell us
about evolution?

05:59.566 --> 06:01.602
-We both share a common
ancestor.

06:01.637 --> 06:03.052
-Correct.

06:03.086 --> 06:05.399
So, in your groups, I'd like
you to list everything you

06:05.434 --> 06:08.126
think we have in common with
chimpanzees in one column, and

06:08.160 --> 06:10.162
our differences in the other.

06:10.197 --> 06:12.958
-I'm listing internal organs,
because they'll be similar.

06:12.993 --> 06:14.097
-This is like us.

06:14.132 --> 06:16.445
-Don't compare me with chimps.

06:16.479 --> 06:16.962
-Not you.

06:16.997 --> 06:20.069
As in, them.

06:20.103 --> 06:22.554
Wolfbloods are clearly
a superior species.

06:22.589 --> 06:24.038
-We're not a superior species.

06:24.073 --> 06:25.661
We're not even that different.

06:25.695 --> 06:28.733
We're just like normal human
beings, but with a bit extra

06:28.767 --> 06:29.596
on the side.

06:29.630 --> 06:30.942
-How can you even say--

06:30.976 --> 06:31.736
-Isn't this supposed to be
a shared discussion?

06:31.770 --> 06:32.426
-What discussion?

06:32.461 --> 06:33.876
-Chimpanzees.

06:33.910 --> 06:36.154
-Well, given the DNA evidence,
I think there's a more

06:36.188 --> 06:38.052
interesting question.

06:38.087 --> 06:41.987
Could someone live and act as
a human, but actually be a

06:42.022 --> 06:43.851
completely different species?

06:43.886 --> 06:45.128
What do you think, Maddy?

06:45.163 --> 06:47.027
-I think--

06:47.061 --> 06:49.236
I think it's completely
irrelevant to the task.

06:49.270 --> 06:50.789
-Yeah.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.273
I mean, we're studying chimps,
not aliens from planet

06:52.308 --> 06:53.136
Shannon.

06:53.171 --> 06:54.621
-Is out blood the same?

06:54.655 --> 06:56.761
-Well, I've never heard of
a chimp blood donor.

06:56.795 --> 06:58.797
-Do we have little wolf prints
in our blood cells?

06:58.832 --> 07:00.247
-That's one way of putting it.

07:00.281 --> 07:01.593
-Yes, Shannon?

07:01.628 --> 07:02.905
-Doesn't that make us
different species?

07:02.939 --> 07:04.596
-Do we have the same
blood as a chimp?

07:04.631 --> 07:06.080
-Not the same, no.

07:06.115 --> 07:08.807
But for this task it's close
enough to be called similar.

07:08.842 --> 07:09.981
-Miss, do you have a plaster?

07:10.015 --> 07:12.259
-Yep.

07:12.293 --> 07:15.918
-So, other than body hair,
what makes us different?

07:15.952 --> 07:17.471
-Uh, agility.

07:17.506 --> 07:20.750
The ability to climb trees,
run on all fours, jump--

07:23.512 --> 07:25.686
-Write this down.

07:25.721 --> 07:27.757
Shannon.

07:27.792 --> 07:28.206
Shannon?

07:28.240 --> 07:29.449
-What?

07:39.700 --> 07:40.839
-Tom.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.742
Does Shannon still have
that stupid werewolf

07:46.776 --> 07:48.191
theory about us?

07:48.226 --> 07:50.642
She does, doesn't she?

07:50.677 --> 07:51.505
I thought we were over this--

07:51.540 --> 07:52.851
-That's her and not me.

07:52.886 --> 07:54.784
-Then she'll know that you
told me what she thinks.

07:54.819 --> 07:55.751
-What am I supposed to do?

07:55.785 --> 07:57.511
-Talk some sense into her?

07:57.546 --> 07:58.305
-I can't.

07:58.339 --> 07:59.548
You know what she's like.

07:59.582 --> 08:01.066
-Tom, I really just
want me friend--

08:01.101 --> 08:01.929
-Fine.

08:01.964 --> 08:03.206
I'll talk to her.

08:03.241 --> 08:03.931
-Thank you.

08:03.966 --> 08:06.106
Tom?

08:06.140 --> 08:06.865
-Now?

08:06.900 --> 08:08.004
-It's lunch time.

08:15.046 --> 08:16.772
-No one believes her.

08:16.806 --> 08:17.738
-That's not the point.

08:17.773 --> 08:18.636
-Then what is the point?

08:18.670 --> 08:21.915
-I want me friend back.

08:21.949 --> 08:23.157
-What are you doing?

08:23.192 --> 08:25.228
-Checking Maddy's blood out.

08:25.263 --> 08:26.713
-Are you joking?

08:26.747 --> 08:28.991
-It could prove that
Maddy's a werewolf.

08:29.025 --> 08:30.855
-Does Miss Parish know
you're doing this?

08:30.889 --> 08:32.753
-No, she thinks I'm reading.

08:32.788 --> 08:33.996
Show us your index finger.

08:34.030 --> 08:34.893
-What for?

08:34.928 --> 08:35.722
-Please, Tom.

08:35.756 --> 08:36.688
Before Parish comes.

08:38.966 --> 08:39.864
-Ow!

08:39.898 --> 08:41.037
-Don't be a big baby.

08:49.598 --> 08:52.601
This is your blood.

08:52.635 --> 08:56.674
And this is Maddy's.

08:58.986 --> 08:59.849
-What are you doing?

08:59.884 --> 09:00.988
-Looking at blood, Miss.

09:01.023 --> 09:02.403
-What blood?

09:02.438 --> 09:05.372
-I'm comparing Tom's to some
I found on the moors.

09:05.406 --> 09:07.236
-Is this about your beast?

09:07.270 --> 09:08.996
-Yes, Miss.

09:09.031 --> 09:10.066
Look, could you please
just have a look?

09:10.101 --> 09:11.343
It's totally different.

09:11.378 --> 09:12.690
-I don't appreciate being
lied to, Shannon.

09:12.724 --> 09:14.036
You told me you were reading.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.969
You know you're not supposed
to touch the

09:16.003 --> 09:17.349
equipment if I'm not here.

09:17.384 --> 09:18.661
-I'm sorry, Miss.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.255
-Well, obviously whatever
this came from has a

09:26.289 --> 09:27.946
wound of some kind.

09:27.981 --> 09:29.430
-A wound?

09:29.465 --> 09:31.398
-What you can see here are the
red and white blood cells.

09:31.432 --> 09:33.952
The white corpuscles are rushing
to the site of the

09:33.987 --> 09:35.851
wound to fight off infection.

09:35.885 --> 09:37.231
-Like if someone
cut their hand?

09:37.266 --> 09:38.750
-Yes.

09:38.785 --> 09:40.062
-Yeah, but Tom's didn't have
any white blood cells.

09:40.096 --> 09:41.857
-Well presumably that's
because it was fresh.

09:44.756 --> 09:46.793
-But it is animal
blood, right?

09:46.827 --> 09:48.070
-You just said it was.

09:48.104 --> 09:49.312
-Yeah, but can't you tell
from looking at it?

09:49.347 --> 09:50.728
-No, Shannon.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.246
We don't have the facilities
to do that here.

09:52.281 --> 09:54.904
You'd have to take it to a
specialist laboratory where it

09:54.939 --> 09:56.216
can be analyzed properly.

09:58.874 --> 10:01.324
-So are you through with this
stupid witch hunt yet?

10:01.359 --> 10:03.016
-You heard her.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.258
Look at her blood through a
microscope, there was nothing.

10:04.293 --> 10:05.708
-Because there's nothing
to prove!

10:05.743 --> 10:06.916
-You believe what you want.

10:06.951 --> 10:08.090
I know what I've seen.

10:08.124 --> 10:09.643
-Listen to yourself!

10:09.678 --> 10:10.748
This is your best friend you're
talking about, Shan.

10:10.782 --> 10:11.921
-A best friend who
was lying to us.

10:11.956 --> 10:12.853
-You don't know that.

10:12.888 --> 10:14.234
-I do!

10:14.268 --> 10:15.166
-Look, all Maddy wants is
her best friend back.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.202
What do you want, Shan?

10:17.237 --> 10:19.860
-The truth.

10:19.895 --> 10:22.449
-You have another
side, Rhydian?

10:22.483 --> 10:25.279
A dark side no one else sees?

10:25.314 --> 10:27.972
Or you?

10:28.006 --> 10:29.249
What about you, Katrina?

10:29.283 --> 10:30.837
-What, like when you wear
a fake tan so you

10:30.871 --> 10:33.391
can't see the join?

10:33.425 --> 10:34.772
-All right.

10:34.806 --> 10:38.154
Everyone line up in
pairs, please.

10:38.189 --> 10:39.190
-Oh, shall we?

10:39.224 --> 10:40.260
Come on.

10:40.294 --> 10:41.192
-A Jekyll and a Hyde
in each group.

10:41.226 --> 10:43.366
This is a mirror exercise.

10:43.401 --> 10:48.717
Doctor Jekyll thinks he can
control his dark side.

10:48.751 --> 10:50.511
But can he?

10:50.546 --> 10:52.065
Jekylls, you lead.

10:52.099 --> 10:54.343
Hydes, you must obey
your master.

10:54.377 --> 10:55.655
Go.

10:59.003 --> 11:01.937
Keep up, Hydes, with
what Jekylls want.

11:01.971 --> 11:03.283
Uh, Liam?

11:03.317 --> 11:06.148
Physical contact.

11:06.182 --> 11:07.218
All right.

11:07.252 --> 11:09.427
Now, then, Hydes,
you tale over.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.326
Only you hate your Jekyll.

11:12.361 --> 11:14.363
Hate him, make it
hard for him.

11:14.397 --> 11:15.675
You want to break free.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.301
Come on, Hyde.

11:21.335 --> 11:23.441
You're being pathetic.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.961
Scream, shout, jump
up and down.

11:25.995 --> 11:27.031
Break his hold over you.

11:27.065 --> 11:27.963
Come on.

11:27.997 --> 11:30.828
Go.

11:30.862 --> 11:31.794
Go.

11:31.829 --> 11:32.726
Go!

11:32.761 --> 11:34.107
That's it, that's better.

11:34.141 --> 11:35.487
Unleash the beast within.

11:35.522 --> 11:36.385
Roar at him!

11:36.419 --> 11:37.697
-Raaah!

11:49.432 --> 11:51.124
-I just booked to the
school secretary.

11:51.158 --> 11:53.091
They can't get in touch with
your foster parents.

11:53.126 --> 11:55.369
-Well I'm not gonna be
here for long, am I?

11:55.404 --> 11:56.474
-Wouldn't be so sure
about that.

11:56.508 --> 11:57.199
-Why?

11:57.233 --> 11:58.269
What's it say?

11:58.303 --> 12:00.098
-You shouldn't be
looking at that.

12:00.133 --> 12:00.961
-Brilliant.

12:00.996 --> 12:01.513
This is me--

12:01.548 --> 12:03.101
-Doctor Okanawe.

12:03.136 --> 12:03.999
Tom called me.

12:04.033 --> 12:05.517
He said you fainted?

12:05.552 --> 12:07.588
-Um, that's what the people in
the ambulance told me after I

12:07.623 --> 12:08.382
came to.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.280
-Well, you are pale.

12:09.314 --> 12:10.522
Pulse is weak.

12:10.557 --> 12:13.077
Get me a full blood count,
UNE, LFT, CRP,

12:13.111 --> 12:15.079
culture, and serology.

12:15.113 --> 12:16.459
-What is that about?

12:16.494 --> 12:18.047
-We're going to run some tests
on Rhydian's blood.

12:18.082 --> 12:20.567
Just routine, in case
he has an infection.

12:20.601 --> 12:21.913
What were you doing when
this happened?

12:21.948 --> 12:23.087
-Uh, drama.

12:23.121 --> 12:24.157
-Improv.

12:24.191 --> 12:25.468
-Rhydian just got
carried away.

12:25.503 --> 12:27.367
I mean, is that blood test
really necessary?

12:27.401 --> 12:29.369
-Probably not, but we
ought to make sure.

12:29.403 --> 12:31.129
-It's just a blood
test, Maddy.

12:31.164 --> 12:33.269
Nothing to worry about.

12:33.304 --> 12:34.408
-Are you all right?

12:34.443 --> 12:36.031
You're looking a bit
pale yourself.

12:36.065 --> 12:37.135
-Yeah, I'm fine.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.585
Just hungry.

12:38.619 --> 12:40.829
-Go to the canteen, get some
juice and something to eat.

12:40.863 --> 12:42.140
-I haven't any money.

12:42.175 --> 12:44.798
-Tom, get your friend
something to eat.

12:44.833 --> 12:45.626
-Come on, guys.

12:45.661 --> 12:47.456
Don't argue with the doctor.

12:47.490 --> 12:49.009
-Bring me back a sausage roll.

12:49.044 --> 12:50.148
-I'll be back to check on you
when we get the results.

12:53.911 --> 12:56.223
-Wow, your mum is scary.

12:56.258 --> 12:57.949
-Tell me about it.

12:57.984 --> 12:59.295
-I'm just gonna give
Mum and Dad a ring.

12:59.330 --> 13:00.469
Let them know where I am.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.405
[phone ringing]

13:05.439 --> 13:07.269
[snoring]

13:23.872 --> 13:25.183
-You have to get out of here.

13:25.218 --> 13:25.666
Like, now.

13:25.701 --> 13:26.219
-What?

13:26.253 --> 13:27.185
Why?

13:27.220 --> 13:28.221
I'm comfy.

13:28.255 --> 13:29.187
-The blood test, you idiot.

13:29.222 --> 13:30.361
They'll see you're not human.

13:30.395 --> 13:32.259
They'll find out you're
a wolf blood.

13:32.294 --> 13:33.882
-You sure they can do that?

13:33.916 --> 13:35.953
-When I was seven, I skewered
me foot on a garden fork.

13:35.987 --> 13:37.575
Mum and Dad didn't want to
take us to the hospital

13:37.609 --> 13:40.854
because it was too risky, in
case they took a blood test.

13:40.889 --> 13:42.614
Had to wait a whole day for
some doctor they knew in

13:42.649 --> 13:44.099
Scotland to drive
down and see us.

13:48.034 --> 13:48.689
-Ow.

13:48.724 --> 13:50.622
I hate no moon days.

13:50.657 --> 13:51.865
-Just go.

13:51.900 --> 13:52.970
I'll keep everyone
in the canteen.

13:56.525 --> 13:59.114
-I so wish it was Maddy getting
that blood test.

13:59.148 --> 14:00.909
-I'm really starting to dislike
you, Shannon Kelly.

14:00.943 --> 14:01.979
-Why?

14:02.013 --> 14:03.946
-You don't wish your
friends illness.

14:03.981 --> 14:07.432
-That is not what I meant,
and you know it.

14:07.467 --> 14:07.985
-Hey.

14:08.019 --> 14:09.262
-Hey.

14:09.296 --> 14:10.504
-Did you get through
to your mum?

14:10.539 --> 14:12.196
-Yep.

14:12.230 --> 14:13.197
-So what do you fancy?

14:13.231 --> 14:14.370
-Something meaty.

14:34.494 --> 14:37.117
-Should be done by now.

14:37.152 --> 14:38.291
-Don't worry, Maddy.

14:38.325 --> 14:39.395
I bet there's nothing
wrong with him.

14:39.430 --> 14:40.534
-Yeah.

14:43.503 --> 14:44.642
-Rhydian Morris.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.648
Lots of people are scared
of needles, Rhydian.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.443
But it's all in the mind.

14:52.477 --> 14:55.066
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about.

14:55.101 --> 14:55.687
-Yeah, but--

14:55.722 --> 14:56.965
I feel fine.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.380
This is just a waste
of NHS resources.

14:58.414 --> 14:59.899
-Not when it comes to your
health and well-being.

15:06.181 --> 15:08.148
-Maddy?

15:08.183 --> 15:09.494
Maddy, how are you feeling?

15:09.529 --> 15:10.979
-What's going on?

15:11.013 --> 15:12.739
What's with the mask?

15:12.773 --> 15:15.362
-It's precautionary, just in
case you and Rhydian have a

15:15.397 --> 15:16.777
virus that's catching.

15:16.812 --> 15:18.158
I've asked the others to wait
in the canteen until the

15:18.193 --> 15:19.953
results of your blood
tests come back.

15:19.988 --> 15:21.575
-They've taken both our blood.

15:21.610 --> 15:23.060
-I'm sure it's nothing
serious.

15:23.094 --> 15:24.406
Where are your mum and dad?

15:24.440 --> 15:25.579
I tried calling, but just
got the answer phone.

15:25.614 --> 15:27.064
-I don't know.

15:27.098 --> 15:28.306
-Right, you two.

15:28.341 --> 15:29.376
I'll be back soon.

15:29.411 --> 15:33.415
And this time, no
wandering off.

15:33.449 --> 15:34.657
-We have to find that lab.

15:34.692 --> 15:36.176
-And do what?

15:36.211 --> 15:37.971
-Get the blood samples back,
swap them, destroy them.

15:38.006 --> 15:38.661
I don't know.

15:38.696 --> 15:40.249
-Easier said than done.

15:40.284 --> 15:41.112
I feel terrible.

15:41.147 --> 15:42.320
-It's getting dark soon.

15:42.355 --> 15:43.632
That's why.

15:43.666 --> 15:45.289
Look, we've got to
do something.

15:45.323 --> 15:47.498
Or do you want the whole world
to know you're a wolfblood?

15:51.398 --> 15:53.159
-Stop pacing, Shan.

15:53.193 --> 15:54.229
-I can't.

15:54.263 --> 15:55.023
This is gonna rock
the world, Tom.

15:55.057 --> 15:56.265
-Who cares?

15:56.300 --> 15:57.163
Our best friend's unconscious,
and it might

15:57.197 --> 15:58.302
be something serious.

15:58.336 --> 16:00.200
-Yeah, like the fact
she's a werewolf.

16:00.235 --> 16:02.478
These tests results are gonna
prove it, and you'll see.

16:02.513 --> 16:03.583
-And then what?

16:03.617 --> 16:04.825
-What do you mean,
and then what?

16:04.860 --> 16:05.757
-Well, let's just say,
for the sake of this

16:05.792 --> 16:06.689
argument, you are right.

16:06.724 --> 16:07.518
Which I don't believe.

16:07.552 --> 16:08.657
But then what?

16:08.691 --> 16:10.107
Maddy's supposed to be
our best friend.

16:10.141 --> 16:11.384
What do you think will
happen to her?

16:11.418 --> 16:12.247
-I don't know.

16:12.281 --> 16:13.489
-I do.

16:13.524 --> 16:15.526
They'll cart her off somewhere,
lock her up, and

16:15.560 --> 16:16.527
get loads of tests run on her.

16:16.561 --> 16:17.390
And we'll never see her again.

16:17.424 --> 16:19.116
Is that what you want?

16:19.150 --> 16:19.668
-Of course not.

16:19.702 --> 16:21.532
-Exactly.

16:21.566 --> 16:22.774
So you better pray you're wrong
about this, and stop

16:22.809 --> 16:25.191
acting like it's
Christmas day.

16:25.225 --> 16:27.124
-I'm not the one hiding secrets
with my friends.

16:33.716 --> 16:34.994
-This place is massive.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.585
-I can't see blood or
laboratory anywhere.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.725
-What is the technical
name for it?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.037
-I haven't got a clue.

16:46.557 --> 16:48.214
-Excuse me.

16:48.248 --> 16:49.456
What is the name of the place
where they do the blood tests?

16:49.491 --> 16:50.733
-That would be phlebotomy
and pathology.

16:57.154 --> 17:00.812
-Man is not truly one,
but truly two.

17:00.847 --> 17:02.262
-You're reading's definitely
getting better.

17:02.297 --> 17:03.746
-It's a stupid story, Ma.

17:03.781 --> 17:05.540
How could someone physically
change and then change back?

17:05.576 --> 17:06.541
-That's not stupid.

17:06.577 --> 17:08.199
Look at moths and butterflies.

17:08.233 --> 17:10.821
They both start as caterpillars,
pupate, and then

17:10.857 --> 17:12.479
become something totally
different.

17:12.513 --> 17:14.102
I mean, if we didn't know they
were the same, we'd never be

17:14.136 --> 17:15.205
able to tell.

17:15.241 --> 17:16.173
-Isn't this story
more about the

17:16.207 --> 17:17.311
character than the science?

17:17.346 --> 17:18.796
-Yeah.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.212
Doctor Jekyll is terrified of
the truth coming out, and

17:21.247 --> 17:23.318
he'll do anything to
conceal the secret.

17:23.352 --> 17:24.284
-Anything?

17:24.319 --> 17:25.423
-Anything.

17:31.912 --> 17:33.121
-Did I say something wrong?

17:33.155 --> 17:33.880
-Don't worry.

17:33.914 --> 17:35.157
She's mad.

17:42.130 --> 17:46.341
-This has got to be the way.

17:46.375 --> 17:47.445
-It's locked.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.482
Need one of them ID
cards to get in.

17:49.516 --> 17:52.381
-We're stuck.

17:52.416 --> 17:55.281
-Excuse me.

17:55.315 --> 17:56.627
-Let me get the door for you.

18:11.538 --> 18:12.643
-I knew it!

18:18.235 --> 18:19.339
-What?

18:35.597 --> 18:36.667
-They've gone.

18:36.701 --> 18:37.495
-Who?

18:37.530 --> 18:38.807
-Maddy and Rhydian.

18:38.841 --> 18:39.842
They've gone to get their
blood tests back.

18:39.877 --> 18:40.671
-What?

18:40.705 --> 18:41.879
Why?

18:41.913 --> 18:42.845
-You'll see when you
get their results.

18:42.880 --> 18:43.915
But that's where they'll be.

18:43.950 --> 18:44.847
-What is going on
with your four?

18:44.882 --> 18:45.607
-Look, I'll explain later.

18:45.641 --> 18:46.228
Can we just--

18:46.263 --> 18:47.402
please.

18:53.856 --> 18:56.480
-So what now?

18:56.514 --> 18:58.206
We can't just ring the
doorbell and ask

18:58.240 --> 19:00.863
for our blood back.

19:00.898 --> 19:02.348
So much for human powers.

19:05.489 --> 19:06.628
-Yes

19:06.662 --> 19:08.457
-Doctor Okanawe said
you'd show us how

19:08.492 --> 19:09.700
your blood's tested.

19:09.734 --> 19:10.459
-What?

19:10.494 --> 19:11.426
She can't do that.

19:11.460 --> 19:12.841
This is a restricted area.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.223
-But it's for a homework
assignment, and we've come all

19:15.257 --> 19:15.947
this way.

19:15.982 --> 19:16.845
-Look, don't get upset.

19:16.879 --> 19:18.157
All right?

19:19.951 --> 19:21.229
-Please?

19:23.645 --> 19:24.784
-Come on.

19:32.619 --> 19:33.793
-Told you.

19:33.827 --> 19:35.035
-How do you know they
haven't gone home?

19:35.070 --> 19:36.623
-Because they don't want
their blood tested.

19:36.658 --> 19:37.693
-Tom?

19:37.728 --> 19:39.212
-It's Shannon's call,
not mine.

19:39.247 --> 19:40.455
-Look, I don't want to
say anymore, because

19:40.489 --> 19:41.939
you'll think I'm mad.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.906
But they have gone to the lab,
and they will try and stop

19:43.941 --> 19:45.218
that blood test.

19:49.015 --> 19:49.774
-This is amazing.

19:49.809 --> 19:52.329
Isn't it, Rhydian?

19:52.363 --> 19:53.640
-Yeah.

19:53.675 --> 19:54.814
Amazing.

19:54.848 --> 19:57.472
-You've got a really
important job.

19:57.506 --> 19:59.957
-Yeah, well.

19:59.991 --> 20:03.478
It's actually quite boring.

20:03.512 --> 20:05.342
-Where's our blood?

20:05.376 --> 20:06.377
-Oh, yeah.

20:06.412 --> 20:06.791
Right.

20:06.826 --> 20:08.310
Names?

20:08.345 --> 20:09.760
-Maddy Smith and
Rhydian Morris.

20:09.794 --> 20:10.623
-Maddy.

20:10.657 --> 20:11.486
Is that, uh, Madeline?

20:11.520 --> 20:12.590
Madeline, yes?

20:12.625 --> 20:13.246
Very nice.

20:13.281 --> 20:14.523
And Rhydian.

20:14.558 --> 20:16.594
Great name.

20:16.629 --> 20:17.664
Morris.

20:17.699 --> 20:21.944
Ah, you're in this
tray, over here.

20:21.979 --> 20:23.739
-Can we see?

20:23.774 --> 20:26.742
-What, you want to see
your own blood?

20:26.777 --> 20:27.916
-Yes, please.

20:27.950 --> 20:29.883
-You're not vampires, are you?

20:33.093 --> 20:34.060
-Silly.

20:34.094 --> 20:35.958
Stuff like that doesn't exist.

20:35.993 --> 20:37.063
-All right.

20:37.097 --> 20:39.928
Madeline Smith and
Rhydian Morris.

20:39.962 --> 20:41.067
Meet your blood.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.319
-It's all right, it's
all right, guys.

20:51.353 --> 20:52.492
Don't panic.

20:53.976 --> 20:55.254
It's a good job they're
plastic.

21:01.398 --> 21:02.606
-Told you.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.986
-What on Earth are you
two doing in here?

21:04.021 --> 21:05.471
-They said you gave
them permission.

21:05.505 --> 21:07.127
-I did no such thing.

21:07.162 --> 21:08.508
Is that their blood?

21:08.543 --> 21:09.509
-Uh, yeah.

21:09.544 --> 21:10.096
-How long before the results?

21:10.130 --> 21:10.717
-It's done.

21:10.752 --> 21:12.029
-Already?

21:12.063 --> 21:12.719
-Show me.

21:12.754 --> 21:14.411
You two, sit.

21:14.445 --> 21:15.584
-It's just printing out.

21:21.487 --> 21:24.697
-This is most unusual.

21:24.731 --> 21:25.525
Are you two related?

21:25.560 --> 21:26.457
-They're cousins.

21:26.492 --> 21:27.596
Distant.

21:27.631 --> 21:29.460
-That might explain
the coincidence.

21:29.495 --> 21:30.703
You're both AB negative.

21:30.737 --> 21:32.014
It's extremely rare.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.844
Apart from that, everything's
normal.

21:33.878 --> 21:35.673
No virus, no infection.

21:35.708 --> 21:36.916
-What do you mean,
they're normal?

21:36.950 --> 21:38.849
-There's nothing wrong
with your friends.

21:38.883 --> 21:40.954
-Yeah, but are they
full blood tests?

21:40.989 --> 21:42.611
I mean, can you tell
if they're human?

21:42.646 --> 21:43.681
-Of course it's human.

21:43.716 --> 21:44.475
-But--

21:44.510 --> 21:45.718
-Believe it, Shan?

21:45.752 --> 21:47.340
-Well, then, ask them why
they're even here.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.377
-They said they wanted to see
how blood was tested.

21:49.411 --> 21:50.654
-We got curious.

21:50.688 --> 21:52.449
Got bored of lying in bed
all day, as well.

21:52.483 --> 21:54.485
And we're sorry for saying you'd
given us permission.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.038
-I think Dr. Jekylll's gone
to your head, Shannon.

22:20.235 --> 22:22.133
-Hey.

22:22.168 --> 22:24.653
-Don't ask.

22:24.688 --> 22:26.414
You'll only hate me.

22:26.448 --> 22:27.794
With good reason.

22:27.829 --> 22:29.658
-I'd never hate you, Shan.

22:29.693 --> 22:32.212
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

22:32.247 --> 22:33.973
-You wouldn't say that if
you knew what I'd been

22:34.007 --> 22:35.526
saying about you.

22:35.561 --> 22:36.665
-What?

22:36.700 --> 22:39.392
That I'm your beast
on the moors?

22:39.427 --> 22:41.118
-You knew?

22:41.152 --> 22:42.395
-Course I did.

22:45.018 --> 22:46.572
-Tom.

22:46.606 --> 22:48.677
-He's been trying to be a good
friend to both of us.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.026
-I'm such an idiot.

22:53.061 --> 22:54.683
-No, you're not.

22:54.718 --> 22:56.789
Just because you were wrong
about me doesn't mean you're

22:56.823 --> 22:58.618
wrong about the beast.

22:58.653 --> 22:59.792
-Doesn't make me
less of a fool.

23:02.242 --> 23:04.659
-Know what I love about you?

23:04.693 --> 23:05.625
-Nothing.

23:05.660 --> 23:08.076
-You're a truth-hunter.

23:08.110 --> 23:10.009
Brave, and strong.

23:10.043 --> 23:12.874
You stick to your guns,
no matter what.

23:12.908 --> 23:16.947
One day you'll do something
amazing.

23:16.981 --> 23:18.673
Something that will
change the world.

23:18.707 --> 23:22.539
And I'll be there, to
say I told you.

23:22.573 --> 23:24.575
-I'm sorry.

23:24.610 --> 23:27.751
-Honestly, you've got nothing
to be sorry about.

23:34.585 --> 23:35.690
That was Mum.

23:35.724 --> 23:36.932
-Did you they were wrong
about our blood?

23:36.967 --> 23:38.589
-They weren't wrong.

23:38.624 --> 23:41.454
Apparently, when there's no
moon, all trace of wolf in our

23:41.489 --> 23:42.593
blood vanishes.

23:42.628 --> 23:44.181
-So we did all of that
for no reason?

23:44.215 --> 23:44.906
-Yep.

23:44.940 --> 23:46.010
Just got lucky.

23:46.045 --> 23:46.977
-Shannon got unlucky.

23:47.011 --> 23:48.219
-I feel really bad for her.

23:48.254 --> 23:49.911
-She'll get over it.

23:49.945 --> 23:51.982
-I don't want to live like
this anymore, Rhydian.

23:52.016 --> 23:53.880
Looking over me shoulder
all the time.

23:53.915 --> 23:56.676
I've got me friends back, now,
and I really want it to stay

23:56.711 --> 23:57.194
like that.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.575
-Meaning?

23:58.609 --> 24:00.853
-Meaning I'm gonna keep
me wolf self locked

24:00.887 --> 24:02.889
inside for a while.

24:02.924 --> 24:04.063
Stick to being human.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.101
I'd really like it if you
could do the same?

24:08.136 --> 24:10.310
-Are you asking me to pretend
to be something I'm not?

24:10.345 --> 24:11.553
-You do that anyway.

24:11.588 --> 24:12.899
-True.

24:12.934 --> 24:15.730
-I'm sick of the stress, trying
to be both at once.

24:15.764 --> 24:18.664
And being human does have
its advantages.

24:18.698 --> 24:19.630
-Yeah.

24:19.665 --> 24:21.874
-Hanging out, having friends.

24:21.908 --> 24:23.185
Being normal.

24:23.220 --> 24:24.566
-It'll make a nice change.

24:24.601 --> 24:26.085
-And it's not like
it'll be forever.

24:26.119 --> 24:28.190
-Maddy, I get it.

24:28.225 --> 24:28.950
-You do?

24:28.984 --> 24:29.778
-Yeah.

24:29.813 --> 24:30.779
-You don't mind?

24:30.814 --> 24:31.884
-No.

24:31.918 --> 24:35.918
-Thanks, Rhydian.
