00:14.890 --> 00:15.879
Hey.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.098
Hi!

00:19.102 --> 00:20.603
Car's full of gas.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.429
You sure?

00:24.233 --> 00:25.473
And if I'm not?

00:25.567 --> 00:28.274
You'll be paying me back
for those damn invitations.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.522
Oh. Well, then never mind.

00:29.613 --> 00:30.898
(LAUGHING)

00:30.989 --> 00:33.025
Ted is a wonderful man, Dad.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.277
He's the second
greatest guy I ever met.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.030
(ORGAN PLAYING)

00:37.788 --> 00:39.153
(SIGHS)

00:39.248 --> 00:40.283
Guess that's us.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.454
Mmm-hmm.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.766
(CHUCKLES)

01:10.654 --> 01:14.943
Into this holy estate,
these two persons present
now come to be joined.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.570
And so, if any person
may showjust cause

01:17.661 --> 01:19.242
why they may not
be joined together,

01:19.329 --> 01:21.945
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.956
That's what
I like to hear.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.374
(CONGREGATION LAUGHING)

01:26.461 --> 01:28.372
Do you,
Theodore Philip Taylor,

01:28.463 --> 01:31.955
take Nicole Margaret Murray
to be your wife,

01:32.050 --> 01:34.632
and promise before God
and these witnesses

01:34.720 --> 01:36.711
to be her loving
and faithful husband,

01:36.805 --> 01:42.300
in plenty and in want,
in joy and in sorrow,
in sickness and in health,

01:42.394 --> 01:44.760
so long as you
both shall live?

This isn't funny, Ted. Ted?

01:53.989 --> 01:55.900
Are you all right?
Teddy?

02:53.632 --> 02:55.042
Hey.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.384
Hey.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.218
What time is it?

03:00.305 --> 03:01.761
Happy time.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.098
I'm still asleep.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.973
Just think of this
as a dream.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.314
What about House?

03:13.402 --> 03:14.983
I said a dream,
not a nightmare.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.401
He's in the next room.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.944
Sound asleep.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.150
(SNORING)

03:42.431 --> 03:45.218
WOMAN: Esteban,
hope you're getting ready.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.303
Hmm.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.563
(BANGING ON DOOR)

03:54.234 --> 03:55.644
(EXCLAIMS)

04:00.490 --> 04:02.026
I met the neighbors.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.232
Sir, do you know
this man?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.574
(GROANS)

04:06.913 --> 04:10.155
I don't need a temporary.
I need a permanent.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.158
Yesterday.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.585
Please do.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.080
Good morning.
Hardly.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.007
One of my PAs
quit an hour ago,

04:21.094 --> 04:23.927
and l have to reshuffle
next month's schedule.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.256
That's nothing.
I woke up in the wrong
bed this morning.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.511
Any bed you're in
is the wrong one.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.263
That's not what
your mama said.
Oh, snap.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.066
I'll be going now.
To human resources.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.228
He started it.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.482
l was in
the neighbors' kid's bed.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.613
LuckHy,
Esteban still likes
sleeping with Mommy.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.989
How drunk were you?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.866
About yay drunk.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.745
Are you okay? You shouldn't
be drinking at all,
much less...

04:54.836 --> 04:57.794
You sound just
like Esteban's mom.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.121
I need you
in the clinic.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.423
Sorry, I'm busy.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.252
Tell me you have a case.
You know, even if you don't.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.381
l have a case.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.963
Sounds interesting.
I'll take it.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.640
I owe you one.
Now tell me you
don't have a case.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.137
I really do have a case.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.639
We're even.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.518
You guys know
how to honeymoon.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.520
This is Dr. House.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.726
Aphasia and syncope.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.901
He can't speak.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.979
"Aphasia" is Greek
for "loss of voice."

05:24.074 --> 05:27.111
We've ruled out infection,
vocal cord damage and stroke.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.319
A lot of guys syncope
at the altar.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.914
lt's Greek for
"having the vapors."

05:31.998 --> 05:33.579
We ruled out all
the common causes
of fainting,

05:33.667 --> 05:36.830
low blood pressure,
hypoglycemia,
dehydration.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.328
Don't say "ah."

05:43.552 --> 05:46.089
Do you know
what it is?

05:46.179 --> 05:49.046
Roll on your side
and lift up your gown.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.267
There's one thing
they didn't test for.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.349
A test for what?

05:54.104 --> 05:55.389
Faking.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.595
Owl

05:57.107 --> 05:58.222
Test was positive.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.728
(STUTTERING) I can talk.

06:00.819 --> 06:05.483
I wasn't faking.
My voice just
came back right now.

06:05.907 --> 06:09.024
Hey, I'm not the one
you have to convince.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.700
I know he wasn't faking.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.278
Boy, if she's buying that,
she might just be a keeper.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.829
What about
the syncope?

06:14.916 --> 06:16.326
Well, that...

06:18.253 --> 06:20.209
She buying this, too?

06:20.297 --> 06:22.663
Why would he
fake anything?

06:22.757 --> 06:25.294
Kryo podia.
lt's Greek for "duh."

06:26.678 --> 06:29.636
So, you get to keep
the engagement ring.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.762
I don't think
he was faking.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.469
That's because
you're more gullible
than I am.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.100
For instance,
I don't believe

06:39.190 --> 06:41.021
that you called off
your open marriage.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.519
I believe your wife
called it off,

06:42.611 --> 06:44.397
and you called off
telling her that you
weren't calling it off.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.522
(ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS)

06:45.614 --> 06:48.196
Guy doesn't throw
a golden ticket
in the trash.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.399
Same way a guy doesn't
give up a lucrative
medical practice

06:50.493 --> 06:51.824
to come work for you?

06:51.912 --> 06:53.948
That's exactly
why you dabble.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.372
You're compensating for
your professional conquests
with sexual ones.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.744
I'm not
that predictable.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.746
For example,
you're probably
not expecting me

07:00.837 --> 07:02.668
to ask you out
for dinner tonight.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.166
No, thanks.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.246
You won't even
consider it?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.377
I did, just very quickly.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.457
(SlGHS)

07:07.552 --> 07:09.929
Truth is,
since I called
this thing off,

07:10.013 --> 07:11.594
my wife has been
very grateful,

07:11.681 --> 07:13.467
and I could do
with a down night.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.550
If I go out with the boss,
nobody can blame me.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.385
Okay.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.936
If you bring your wife.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.229
No, that's the point.
I need a little...

07:21.316 --> 07:22.396
You're lying.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.769
I'm not lying!

07:23.860 --> 07:25.100
Then I'm not going.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.397
Okay. Fontina at 8:30.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.662
You believe me, right?

07:37.749 --> 07:39.865
Of course,
I believe you.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.370
Then let's do it.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.952
We'll tell the cab to
take us to AC right now
and get it done.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.834
You're serious?
You just walked out
of the emergency room.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.712
Exactly, I walked out.
I feel great.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.587
Well, we do have
the clothes for it.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.092
(COUGHING)

07:57.143 --> 07:59.099
Ted? What's wrong?

08:00.438 --> 08:01.553
Are you...
What's wrong?

08:01.648 --> 08:04.105
Oh, my God.
Can somebody help us?

08:04.192 --> 08:07.650
Please! Please, hurry.
Just breathe. Oh, my God.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.272
There's gotta be
a better way to
call off a wedding.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.607
A tweet, for example.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.488
Pleural effusion.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.284
You think his lung
is faking it?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.948
There's at least 200 cc's
of fluid in there.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.624
Okay, let's say
all his symptoms
are real.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.248
Explain how one of them
suddenly went away

08:25.338 --> 08:27.795
without using the words
"virgin" or "Mary."

08:27.882 --> 08:30.419
If the pleural effusion's
caused by something systemic,

08:30.510 --> 08:32.341
it could explain
his other two symptoms.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.839
So whether
you believe him or not,

08:33.930 --> 08:36.421
all we have to figure out
is what caused the PE.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.974
ER ruled out infection.
Eosinophil count
ruled out parasites.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.598
And medication he's
not telling us about.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.180
You really don't
trust this guy,
do you?

08:45.275 --> 08:47.516
I don't even
trust the ER.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.316
Let's rule out
infections ourselves.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.316
Tap his lung,
send cultures,
run cytology for cancer,

08:52.449 --> 08:54.189
and check
his blood pressure.
We already...

08:54.284 --> 08:56.821
This time,
talk about nuptials
while you do it.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.287
Check his home
for everything else.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.407
He just moved in
with his fiancee
three months ago.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.456
Toxic exposure
could take longer
than that to manifest.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.746
You check
his love nest.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.169
You two check
his swinging
bachelor pad.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.962
That somebody else
now lives in?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.506
I assume so.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.967
Not the glass!

09:18.767 --> 09:20.098
(SlGHS)

09:22.812 --> 09:26.304
Place looks like 1960s?

09:27.317 --> 09:28.523
Could have lead paint.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.067
You think
a 27-year-old has pica?

09:31.154 --> 09:35.067
If it gets us out of here
before the owner
comes back, yes.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.826
What did you tell
that cute physio?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.744
That I changed my mind.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.571
No, you didn't.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.042
You're more nervous
than usual.

09:45.126 --> 09:49.540
Because this B&E
has actual B.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.747
What...

09:51.841 --> 09:54.127
That's a suspended ceiling.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.428
What are you doing?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.096
I want to see
what's above it.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.764
More ceiling.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.104
Made of
40-year-old acoustic tile.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.773
Asbestosis, I like it.
I'll be in the car.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.776
COTTER: What the hell?

10:13.863 --> 10:17.105
It's okay. We're doctors.
Nobody was home, so we...

10:17.200 --> 10:18.565
Well, I'm calling
the police.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.447
Do you know Ted Taylor?
He used to live here.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.906
Yeah, what about him?

10:22.997 --> 10:24.953
He's our patient
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.030
Is he okay?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.242
We think he may
have asbestosis
from your ceiling tiles.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.248
They're not asbestos.
I had them checked
when I moved in.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.374
How sick is he?

10:32.465 --> 10:33.500
Is he a friend
of yours?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.127
He was.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.381
Actually,
he was my boyfriend
for three years.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.134
I'm not gay.
HOUSE: Really?

10:46.229 --> 10:48.971
'Cause it would
certainly explain
the cold feet.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.100
Oh, and the boyfriend.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.977
So you're bisexual?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.649
No, I'm straight.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.148
Cotter, the guy you met,
he's gay.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.230
He had a crush on me.
I left.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.359
After three years?

10:59.450 --> 11:00.576
It's possible.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.946
Doesn't mean you're gay
just because the guy
you're sleeping with is.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.368
We weren't
sleeping together...

11:04.455 --> 11:05.740
What's this got to
do with anything?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.697
Lung tap turned up
mononucleosis.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.623
ER doesn't
routinely test for it.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.498
It explains the PE
and can be virtually
asymptomatic.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.171
We got to wondering,
how does a 27-year-old
get mono?

11:15.258 --> 11:17.465
You're a little old
for the kissing disease

11:17.552 --> 11:19.588
unless your immune system
is compromised.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.215
If there's been
any unprotected sex,

11:22.724 --> 11:24.680
There's been
no sex of any kind.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.847
Okay.

11:25.935 --> 11:30.395
I'll go test
your fiancee for HIV.
She the curious sort?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.263
Wait.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.987
There may have
been some contact.
But I'm not gay.

11:39.073 --> 11:42.861
Sodomy, one of
the top 10 most common
household accidents.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.614
I did a lot of stupid things,
but I turned my life around.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.070
I'm as straight
as any of you.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.363
You don't have
to believe me.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.700
I'm just saying

11:51.794 --> 11:55.662
you can test me
as long as you
don't tell Nicole.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.290
What business is it
of hers?

11:59.302 --> 12:01.418
I don't see
anything wrong with him
marrying a straight woman.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.764
How about it'll
make them both
miserable?

12:03.848 --> 12:05.554
Just like most
straight marriages.

12:05.642 --> 12:09.885
He's got the right to life,
liberty and unhappiness
like the rest of us.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.685
Absolutely no reason
to look at me.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.058
CHASE: I'm not saying
it's a great choice.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.685
Just saying
it's his choice.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.812
But it has to
be hers as well,
which it can't be

12:16.903 --> 12:18.564
as long as she
doesn't know he's gay.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.815
Which is how
it's gonna stay

12:19.906 --> 12:21.237
since we have
no right to tell her.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.734
Like you've never
bent the rules.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.567
You date guys.
You date girls.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.744
I assume, at some point,
you're gonna make a choice.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.570
I don't lie
about who I am.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.076
Patients lying never
bothered you before.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.909
Patients weren't lying
about their sexual
orientation before.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.380
So you're only judgmental
when it gets personal?

12:36.464 --> 12:38.500
Does it bother me
that people hurt others

12:38.591 --> 12:40.127
because they're too weak
to face the truth?

12:40.218 --> 12:41.833
Yeah. Sorry about that.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.465
Tell me she's
not looking at me.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.223
He's negative?
Yep.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.430
Looks like being gay
didn't make him sick.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.230
So maybe being
straight did.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.945
Test was negative,
no HlV.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.192
Told you.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.284
What you didn't tell us
is how you turned
your life around.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.111
That can be pretty hard.
It was.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.117
Downright impossible
on your own.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.948
I talked to some people.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.908
It was more than
just talk, wasn't it?

13:18.715 --> 13:21.582
I know this is
personal stuff.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.088
I'm here to help you,
not out you.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.306
I had therapy.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.099
Conversion therapy.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.314
Went to a camp
for three weeks
of intensive rehabilitation.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.982
They injected him
with emetics while
he watched gay porn.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.148
Apomorphine?

13:40.236 --> 13:43.524
Or lithium chloride,
or cyclophosphamide.
He doesn't know.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.196
And when that didn't work,
they shot him up
with male hormones.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.445
A chemical assault like that
could explain the PE.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.777
And the ECT
explains the rest.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.659
They gave him
electroconvulsive therapy
to make him straight?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.706
To zap the fabulous
right out of him.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.249
Neural damage accounts
for the aphasia.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.373
ECT doesn't cause
neural damage.

13:59.464 --> 14:04.128
Unless it was done
at Dr. Liberace's
He-man Quackery Camp.

14:04.218 --> 14:08.587
Run an EEG. See if
they straightened him
orjust scrambled him.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.218
(TAPPING ON TABLE)

14:18.608 --> 14:19.597
(SlGHS)

14:19.692 --> 14:22.525
Sorry, I completely forgot.

14:22.612 --> 14:26.104
My wife just started
a ceramics class
Tuesdays at 8:00.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.860
It's a half-hour
drive from here.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.486
She won't be back
till 10:30.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.696
She's taking it with
her girlfriend, Marly.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.123
She hopes to make
a tea service.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.455
You want to call her?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.797
No need.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.042
I already texted her.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.124
And here she is now.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.637
I think you're still
seeing the physio.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.549
You got a backup suit
in your car.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.805
Don't wanna be
bringing home da stank.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.678
Okay, yes. You're right.
About everything.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.434
But please, House,
don't tell her.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.560
Hi, Rachel.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.562
Hi, Dr. House.
I didn't know
you'd be here.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.440
Hi, honey.
Got your text, obviously.

15:06.531 --> 15:09.614
I'm just leaving.
I got a ceramics class.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.112
Really?
I love it.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.740
Even managed to talk Chris
into signing up for one.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.742
Of course, he's in
the beginners' class.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.539
You're in
a ceramics class?

15:18.626 --> 15:19.866
Friday nights, right?

15:20.837 --> 15:23.374
Friday nights.
Sounded like fun.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.463
You should join Chris's.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.087
You know, I should.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.634
Well, gotta go.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.712
Making a tea service.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.770
Hi. I must've fallen
asleep in the lounge.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.897
What are they doing?
THIRTEEN: An EEG.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.853
What's it for?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.313
We're looking for
neurological damage

15:50.408 --> 15:51.773
that could've
caused his symptoms.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.699
Damage from what?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.117
A head trauma.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.944
He had an accident?

15:57.039 --> 16:00.122
It wasn't an accident.
It was before he met you.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.586
(STUTTERING) What happened?
Was he hospitalized?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.208
You should
ask him about it.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.958
They have the results.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.970
Everything
looks normal.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.141
Look at this.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.218
(BEEPS)

16:21.314 --> 16:22.645
Beta waves are spiking.

16:22.732 --> 16:23.847
What's that mean?

16:23.941 --> 16:25.021
I'm not sure.

(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

16:28.321 --> 16:29.481
What's happening to him?

16:29.572 --> 16:30.687
He's having
a heart attack.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.612
CHASE: Charging. Clear.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.493

no abnormalities.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.994
So what caused
the arrest?

16:43.085 --> 16:45.212

to stop a heart.

16:45.296 --> 16:49.084
Electrical problems,
restricted blood flow,
blood where it shouldn't be.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.836
Shocks, blocks
or bleeds.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.212
I think that's
three things.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.839
And cheating.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.722
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
No, sorry, that's
how you break a heart.

16:58.476 --> 17:03.061
I found a ceramics class
in Trenton on Friday nights
that was full,

17:03.147 --> 17:05.854
so my wife
couldn'tjoin me.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.605
EP study
ruled out shocks.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.858
Now you just have to find
some Pottery by Taub.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.530
The lamer it looks,
the better.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.858
So we'll do an angio
to see if it's
blocks or bleeds.

17:16.953 --> 17:17.988
You should be a doctor.

17:27.004 --> 17:30.087
I'm going to check out
this new lesbian bar tonight.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.835
Your life is awesome.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.041
You wanna come?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.931
l was telling
a 33-year-old woman
that she has breast cancer.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.811
No, you weren't.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.438
How do you know?
Because if you were,

17:51.529 --> 17:53.235
you'd need to see
the pain in her eyes

17:53.322 --> 17:54.903
so she can see
the concern in yours.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.108
Why are you setting me up
on dates with my team?

17:58.202 --> 17:59.578
Taub asking me out
was quirky,

17:59.662 --> 18:01.698
but Thirteen doing it
is a barking cat.

18:01.789 --> 18:02.904
I'm doing it
to help you.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.491
By setting me up
with a hottie that
I can't sleep with?

18:06.586 --> 18:07.575
And Thirteen?

18:07.670 --> 18:09.501
I've been spending
more time with Sam.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.749
I know it's been
hard on you.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.046
I figured if you
had some company...

18:12.133 --> 18:13.248
I don't need your help.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.254
Then consider it
helping our neighbor's
four-year-old.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.256
I gave him a dollar.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.382
How much did you
have to pay?

18:19.473 --> 18:20.428
Nothing.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.256
I just told them
you might be feeling down,

18:22.351 --> 18:25.138
and it was in
their self-interest
to keep you company.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.682
A hundred bucks.
Foreman held out for 200.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.936
House,
I'm worried about you.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.770
You could've ended up
in jail or worse.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.946
Racking you with guilt.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.615
So I do something
really stupid,
and you reward me.

18:39.702 --> 18:43.411
Read any parenting manual.
That's not helping me.
That's helping you.

18:44.874 --> 18:49.959
Fine, I did it for me,
for my relationship,
out of pure self-interest.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.286
Okay.

18:52.423 --> 18:53.538

18:57.970 --> 18:59.961
It's not gonna work,
though.

19:00.056 --> 19:04.095

can a night out
at a lesbian bar be?

19:20.576 --> 19:23.238
They said you had
a head trauma?

19:25.081 --> 19:29.620
I fell off a stepladder
and hit my head.
It was a stupid accident.

when he's upright,

20:07.415 --> 20:09.280
reverts to normal
when he's lying down.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.536
He was lying down
both times we took
his blood pressure.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.913
Protracted hypotension
could have induced
his heart attack.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.130
Also explains
his syncope.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.249
And his aphasia.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.047
He was upright,
then you laid him down
on the bed to test him.

BP reverted to normal,
voice came back.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.714

had nothing to do with it.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.204
I need to hear it
from you, Ted.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.333
(SIGHS)

23:54.892 --> 23:59.226
One night,
I got really drunk
and I went to bed.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.557
And he came
into my room,

24:08.030 --> 24:09.566
and one thing
led to another.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.864
The whole thing
was a mistake.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.820
Are you saying
you had sex with him?

24:15.537 --> 24:17.789
I was drunk
and confused...

24:17.873 --> 24:18.953
You're gay?

24:19.041 --> 24:20.076
No.

24:22.252 --> 24:25.210
I thought I was.

24:27.591 --> 24:31.209
I even made up my mind
to tell my family.

24:32.054 --> 24:35.046
I stood in front of
the bathroom mirror,
psyching myself up.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.261
But all I could see
was disgust.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.268
And that's
when I realized

24:42.147 --> 24:47.267
I didn't hate the thought
of admitting I was gay
because I was ashamed.

24:47.403 --> 24:51.066
I hated the thought
because I wasn't gay.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.482
And that was the day
I went to get help.

24:55.411 --> 24:58.323
So you're not gay?

24:58.747 --> 25:00.328
They cured me, Nicole.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.538
That's what all
the head trauma is about.

25:04.628 --> 25:08.587
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but it's all in the past now.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.006
Itdoesnt
matter anymore.

25:17.891 --> 25:18.846
What is it?

25:18.934 --> 25:20.344
(GROANING)

25:21.937 --> 25:23.438
Oh, my head!

25:26.775 --> 25:28.151
He's got
severe headaches.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.600
So do I.

25:30.446 --> 25:33.688
Should I call or raise
with a double gutshot draw?

25:36.869 --> 25:38.951
Nope.
What about infection?

25:39.038 --> 25:40.073
That's what
we're thinking.

25:40.164 --> 25:43.031
Cerebral infection would
explain the headaches,
could've caused POTS.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.661
If it's fungal,
could've spread
to the heart.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.038
I was talking about you.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.336
Has the little gent
been wearing a tent?

25:50.299 --> 25:53.006
Remind me why that has
anything to do with you.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.342
A distracted person makes
a distracted professional.

25:55.471 --> 25:58.087
And destroying my marriage
will help me focus.

25:58.182 --> 25:59.638
Probably.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.470
Do a spinal tap,
run the CSF.

26:03.645 --> 26:06.136
Still talking about you!

26:06.231 --> 26:08.483
But you can do it
on the patient, too,
if you want.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.186
(ELECTRONICA MUSIC PLAYING)

26:27.169 --> 26:28.329
What about her?

26:28.420 --> 26:29.580
The bartender?

26:29.671 --> 26:32.583
She's the only one
who's not here for fun.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.255
Trust me,
she's not straight.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.425
If your gaydar
is so great,

26:36.512 --> 26:38.878
how come you didn't
know about the patient
till you met his boyfriend?

26:39.014 --> 26:40.754
Guy walked in
with his bride,

26:40.849 --> 26:43.340
it took me awhile
to rotate my dish.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.723
It's unbelievable
what he's doing to her.

26:46.814 --> 26:48.020
You don't think
he loves her?

26:48.565 --> 26:51.181
He may love her,
but he needs to have sex
with other men.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.814
Taub loves his wife,
he needs to have sex
with other women.

26:54.905 --> 26:58.193
Yeah, it sucks what
he's doing to her, too,
but it's hardly the same.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.398
To be faithful
to his wife,

26:59.493 --> 27:01.324
our patient has to
deny his identity.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.617
Taub just needs to...

27:02.704 --> 27:04.444
Has to resist
the biological imperative.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.622
It is easier to
say no to dessert

27:06.708 --> 27:07.914
than to pretend
you don't eat.

obviously never been
on a diet.

You're successful, smart,
and you attract everything
that moves.

If you wanna focus
on the fact

27:19.721 --> 27:21.928
that you're not
gonna see 50,
that's your choice.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.922
You know what?
I agree with you.

What about yours?

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

27:32.943 --> 27:34.058
Yeah.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.151
CSF was negative
for infection,

27:36.238 --> 27:37.273
and his headaches
are worse.

We were just
talking about you.

You did a spinal tap and
the headaches got worse.

We're maxing him out
on morphine.

27:54.590 --> 27:58.378
He sprung a leak.
He's losing CSF
from the tap site.

worse?

HOUSE: Just you, actually.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.305
That still wouldn't explain
why he got the headaches
in the first place.

28:05.434 --> 28:09.097
Low pressure in his brain
caused the POTS,
not the other way around.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.146
Patch the leak,
top him up with
artificial CSF.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.391
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

28:22.201 --> 28:25.034

That should stop the leak.

You should be feeling
some relief soon.

I spoke to my parents.

Then what is it?

It's really not POTS,
we're really back
to square one.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.788
So what's masquerading
as a stroke?

Halloween costume,
by the way.

no hilar masses.

Any luck with
the pottery?

29:28.308 --> 29:29.423
Wasn't easy.

cruddy set of fife and
drum napkin rings online.

set you back?
Too much.

we can trust his history.

by the victor,

how do we find out
what really happened?

30:17.357 --> 30:18.472
Let's get them all
in the same room.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.899
Or we could
question them separately
and not torture them.

30:21.028 --> 30:24.145
Or we could get them
all in the same room
and get the truth.

already paid us.

We never had
that problem.

31:40.482 --> 31:43.440
Gee, that must be
because Ted doesn't
like girls.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.733

it's vascular.

but arterial disease
causing acute ischemia

And if the tumor's big enough,
his headaches and syncope.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.171
Except we cleared him
for cancer.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.713
Didn't say "cancer,"
prolactinomas can
be benign.

35:01.224 --> 35:05.012
Check his prolactin level
and MRI his pituitary.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.864
Sounds like you
had fun last night.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.449
You believe Chase?

35:21.536 --> 35:23.322
I believe Foreman.

35:23.413 --> 35:26.576
And they had fun with you.
What happened?

35:26.666 --> 35:28.372
(SIGHS)

35:29.711 --> 35:32.703
I realized that
they could be
my friends.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.629
You're serious.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.051
And then I sobered up.

35:40.180 --> 35:41.636
You weren't that drunk.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.681
You managed to find
your way into your own
little bed last night.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.555
I think I sleep better
in rocket-ship sheets.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.643
No. You want to
blame this on the booze,

35:49.731 --> 35:51.892
but that's easy.
Change is hard.

35:52.025 --> 35:53.640
And wisdom is knowing
the difference

35:53.735 --> 35:56.397
between what
you can change...

36:00.742 --> 36:03.154
And what
you were born with.

36:03.244 --> 36:07.453
And cowardice is labeling
what you don't wanna
change as innate.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.077
I was winning
this argument.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.329
Pituitary MRI...

36:15.423 --> 36:16.629
Was normal.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.631
How are the headaches?

36:21.721 --> 36:22.927
Terrible.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.172
Give me your head.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.346
What the hell?

36:26.434 --> 36:27.594
I know, it's the
first time you heard

36:27.686 --> 36:29.551
that sentence with
a possessive pronoun.

36:29.646 --> 36:30.977
(GROANS)

36:35.610 --> 36:38.568
Oh, wow, that's better.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.904
(MOANING)

36:45.161 --> 36:46.446
(SIGHS)

36:47.497 --> 36:48.532
Okay. Enough.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.033
HOUSE: How cool is that?

36:50.709 --> 36:52.700
You have
a Chiari Malformation,

36:52.794 --> 36:56.662
a narrowing
in the base of your skull
that can cut off CSF flow.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.543
But it wasn't a problem
until the ECT at
Breeder Boot Camp

36:59.634 --> 37:02.626
caused your brain
to swell just enough
to plug the opening.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.087
And when your brain
pressed up against
your pituitary,

37:05.181 --> 37:08.014
it signed you up
for La Leche League.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.050
You still won't
be pitching a tent
for your lady,

37:10.145 --> 37:13.637
but that's just because,
you know, she's a lady.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.814
Its orthostatic effect
was mimicking POTS.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.437
It also does an uncanny
Christopher Walken.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.694
Unfortunately,
if you treat it like POTS,
it gets worse.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.693
So, as far
as that goes, oops.

37:25.034 --> 37:27.195
Proper treatment is surgery.
We'll get you in right away.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.573
So, how did
I get this thing?

37:29.664 --> 37:30.824
Overbearing mother.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.457
Kidding, CM's congenital.

37:34.544 --> 37:37.377
Like so many other things,
you were born that way.

37:54.147 --> 37:57.264
Thought you might
be running low, so...

37:57.901 --> 37:59.437
Thanks.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.024
I'm not coming back.

38:05.325 --> 38:06.440
(SIGHS)

38:06.534 --> 38:08.274
Ted, this is a mistake.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.155
I know you're hurting,
and I'm sorry...

38:10.246 --> 38:12.862
I'm talking
about hurting her.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.163
I love her.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.616
Ted...

38:16.711 --> 38:19.703
Thank you
for your support.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.632
We both really
appreciate it.

38:26.513 --> 38:28.003
Good luck.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.099
(DOOR SLIDES OPEN)

38:51.913 --> 38:52.993
Hey.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.291
You know what
I've been thinking?

38:58.378 --> 39:00.585
It's your birthday
in three weeks.

39:02.674 --> 39:06.258
What do you say we
re-book the church and
make it a doubleheader?

39:08.429 --> 39:09.680
I don't know, Ted.

39:10.723 --> 39:14.966
Less than a week ago,
we were standing at
the altar perfectly happy.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.017
Nothing's changed.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.185
Really?

39:18.273 --> 39:20.138
I still love you.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.569
Do you still love me?

39:25.238 --> 39:28.275
Yes, but...

39:28.366 --> 39:29.981
Then that's all
that matters.

39:33.663 --> 39:37.201
But I think that
you still love him.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.503
How can you
promise me that?

39:47.594 --> 39:51.303
Because I believe
that we get to choose
how we live our lives.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.505
And I've made my choice.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.927
So now,
l have to make mine.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.853
I'm so sorry.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.020
Nic...

40:02.108 --> 40:03.143
I'm sorry.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.569
NiC!

40:08.156 --> 40:09.692
No. No.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.200
I'm not saying goodbye.

40:14.287 --> 40:15.493
Yeah.

40:18.583 --> 40:22.371
I want to marry you!
I have to marry you!

40:25.173 --> 40:26.162
TED: NiC.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.045
HOUSE: It's Friday night.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.092
I called it off.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.802
For real this time.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.808
Frees you up
for the next one.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.226
One day at a time.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.486
Napkin rings.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.902
My way of saying thanks.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.494
For trying to
wreck your marriage?

40:55.578 --> 40:57.443
For trying to save it.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.530
And I get napkin rings.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.081
Expensive ones.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.551
I hired a replacement
for my PA.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.140
She seems great.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.101
Good work.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.523
You, too.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.987
Your patient's
going home tomorrow.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.936
He doesn't have a home.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.281
You want to
grab a bite to eat?

41:38.329 --> 41:41.696
So Wilson got to you, too.

41:41.791 --> 41:44.157
No, this is just me.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.241
Lucas?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.416
Working late.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.418
I'm buying.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.712
Not that hungry.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.587
Okay.

42:05.565 --> 42:08.102
I just want us
to be friends.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.902
Funny.

42:13.990 --> 42:16.948
That's the last thing
I want us to be.
