00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:05.216 --> 00:06.547
SUZY: Harley, come down here.
I need to see you.

00:06.547 --> 00:08.679
Uh-oh.

00:08.679 --> 00:12.133
Mom yelling, "I need to see you"
is never followed by

00:12.133 --> 00:13.844
"You're getting
a pizza party."

00:13.844 --> 00:16.306
Nope. It means you're busted.

00:16.306 --> 00:17.848
Not sure why.

00:17.848 --> 00:21.102
I've been 100% super good.
Mostly.

00:23.854 --> 00:26.907
Come on.
Saturday morning dentist?

00:26.907 --> 00:29.820
( imitates drill sound )

00:29.820 --> 00:32.453
You'd do the same thing.

00:34.955 --> 00:36.917
Okay, I erased it.

00:36.917 --> 00:39.120
Did anyone really wanna start
their weekend with...

00:39.120 --> 00:40.541
( imitates drill sound )

00:40.541 --> 00:42.963
Hey, we brought you down
for a nice surprise.

00:42.963 --> 00:44.465
What was that?

00:44.465 --> 00:46.467
Uh, excitement.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.259
Wheee!

00:48.259 --> 00:52.052
Stop! No, you've done so many
nice things for the family,

00:52.052 --> 00:54.935
we decided to do
something nice for you.

00:54.935 --> 00:56.517
Yes! Pizza party!

00:56.517 --> 00:59.100
Wait, she's getting
a pizza party

00:59.100 --> 01:02.483
BOTH: Pizza? Wheee!

01:02.483 --> 01:05.396
Enough! The next person to make
that sound is punished.

01:05.396 --> 01:07.108
No one's getting
a pizza party.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.360
You all know the surprise is
Harley is getting a segment

01:09.360 --> 01:11.532
on her favorite TV show
 Girl Power.

01:11.532 --> 01:14.495
And that's exactly how
we wanted to deliver the news.

01:14.495 --> 01:16.247
Me on Girl Power?

01:16.247 --> 01:19.410
That show only has girls
with amazing accomplishments.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.962
Like that one that taught
her dog sign language.

01:21.962 --> 01:24.755
Look. Fire hydrant.

01:24.755 --> 01:27.378
This is so exciting.
Everyone do the thing.

01:31.011 --> 01:33.344
"Ratsongc"?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.557
It's supposed to say
"Congrats,"

01:36.557 --> 01:38.719
but we're not good
at standing still.

01:40.181 --> 01:42.603
How did this happen?

01:42.603 --> 01:43.774
Harley went on TV
before me?

01:43.774 --> 01:45.436
How did this happen?

01:45.436 --> 01:46.987
Oh, don't worry, Rachel.

01:46.987 --> 01:49.400
When there's a show about
shallow, moody girls,

01:49.400 --> 01:51.822
- we'll submit you.
- Ugh.

01:51.822 --> 01:54.235
Yeah. Girl Glower.
 Up top.

01:54.235 --> 01:55.996
Not your moment, Dad.

01:55.996 --> 01:58.369
Harley, you're
an amazing inventor.

01:58.369 --> 02:00.581
So we submitted
an application to the show

02:00.581 --> 02:02.002
highlighting some of
your greatest hits.

02:03.334 --> 02:05.626
Conveyor belt table,
Slushinator,

02:05.626 --> 02:08.589
skate kite.

02:08.589 --> 02:10.591
So when's the camera
crew coming?

02:10.591 --> 02:12.633
( doorbell rings )

02:12.633 --> 02:15.466
Oh, sorry. I ordered
a pizza earlier.

02:15.466 --> 02:18.469
Hey, I guess it is
a pizza party.

03:13.274 --> 03:17.027
As an inventor, I make things
to solve problems for my family.

03:17.027 --> 03:18.659
Like vacuuming.

03:18.659 --> 03:20.911
We all hate it,
so I invented something

03:20.911 --> 03:22.533
to make it fun.

03:22.533 --> 03:25.326
Say hello to
the Pick-Me-Up.

03:25.326 --> 03:27.498
Picks up dust
and your mood.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.090
Pick-Me-Up,
let's dance.

03:30.090 --> 03:33.714
That's right,
it's voice activated

03:33.714 --> 03:35.836
and even has a camera
to record your moves.

03:37.928 --> 03:39.600
This is awkward.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.473
I'm not used to dancing
in front of an audience.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.844
You're doing great.

03:43.844 --> 03:47.057
You put the "pow"
in Girl Power.

03:47.057 --> 03:49.109
Ooh, that's good.
Remember that for the promo.

03:49.109 --> 03:51.482
Okay. The Pick-Me-Up has...

03:51.482 --> 03:54.064
- ( door opens )
- TOM: Guys, quiet.
Harley's doing her segment.

03:54.064 --> 03:56.617
Uh, guys, you're supposed
to be at the mall.

03:56.617 --> 03:58.118
Sorry. Forgot my wallet.

03:58.118 --> 04:00.451
Yeah, I have to go
to the bathroom.

04:00.451 --> 04:02.283
Mom took the pee boot
out of the car.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.535
And Dad said
don't use the bushes

04:04.535 --> 04:06.667
while the camera crew's here.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.958
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:07.958 --> 04:10.541
- Found the pee boot!
- Use the bathroom.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.294
Hi. I'm Rachel.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.966
Check me out at
rachelstyle_snap.loveit.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.721
Whoa, Harley, you didn't
mention that you had

04:20.721 --> 04:23.384
- such a big family.
- I didn't?

04:23.384 --> 04:25.976
Huh. Weird.

04:25.976 --> 04:27.558
Anyway, that's them. Bye.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.440
( all talking )

04:29.440 --> 04:32.152
I think the world
of my family,

04:32.152 --> 04:34.315
but that doesn't mean
I wanna share my family

04:34.315 --> 04:35.526
with the world.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.358
We're going
school shopping.

04:37.358 --> 04:38.819
I'm starting first grade.

04:38.819 --> 04:40.821
Nailed kindergarten.

04:40.821 --> 04:43.163
Turns out there's more.

04:43.163 --> 04:44.955
Aren't you cute?

04:44.955 --> 04:46.407
I could just pinch
your cheek.

04:46.407 --> 04:48.208
Only if you wanna
lose that finger.

04:48.208 --> 04:51.171
She's not kidding.
I think she's part ferret.

04:51.171 --> 04:53.083
( forced laughter )

04:53.083 --> 04:56.176
So funny, you guys.
Go.

04:57.508 --> 04:59.219
Back to the Pick-Me-Up.

04:59.219 --> 05:00.511
It has five settings.

05:00.511 --> 05:02.302
Hey, here's my spare key.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.885
Hang on to it.
We don't want
another key incident.

05:04.885 --> 05:06.727
Key incident?
What is that?

05:06.727 --> 05:08.188
We don't wanna
bore you with--

05:08.188 --> 05:10.601
It was hilarious.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.193
Has anybody
seen my car key?

05:15.696 --> 05:18.739
- ( machine whirring )
- I think we found it.

05:18.739 --> 05:21.201
Wait. Here it is.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.824
Then what's in there?

05:23.824 --> 05:27.037
I guess we'll find out
in 48 hours.

05:27.037 --> 05:30.160
That was a lot of work
just to find a filling.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.754
Seven kids. You really
have your hands full.

05:33.754 --> 05:37.628
And you still manage to keep
such an organized house.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.840
Please. This is just
how we live.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.802
Georgie, no!

05:41.802 --> 05:43.173
Just grabbing a snack.

05:46.887 --> 05:49.059
How did all that stuff
get in there?

05:49.059 --> 05:52.022
Harley, the camera crew
comes in an hour,

05:52.022 --> 05:54.274
and they can't
see the house like this.

05:54.274 --> 05:57.688
We either clean it up
or we burn it down.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.823
I'm good.

06:02.823 --> 06:04.745
I have an idea.

06:04.745 --> 06:06.747
Why don't we finish
this interview,

06:06.747 --> 06:08.038
say, anywhere but here?

06:08.038 --> 06:09.910
Ken, can we talk outside?

06:12.543 --> 06:15.255
We really tried to have
everyone out of the house,

06:15.255 --> 06:17.958
- but you know how it is.
- Diaz happens.

06:17.958 --> 06:19.630
It always does.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.131
And now, Misha and Ken
are outside

06:21.131 --> 06:23.173
"discussing next steps."

06:23.173 --> 06:26.717
That's TV-speak for
"Nice job, wackos. We're out."

06:26.717 --> 06:28.719
We don't know that.

06:28.719 --> 06:31.141
They got some great footage
before Mount Pantry erupted.

06:31.141 --> 06:34.515
I wanted girls to be inspired
by my invention.

06:34.515 --> 06:37.858
There aren't as many female
engineers as there should be,

06:37.858 --> 06:40.280
and this was my chance
to show girls why it's cool.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.283
So we ruined your segment
and set back the women's
movement.

06:43.283 --> 06:46.116
Bad morning,
even for us.

06:46.116 --> 06:48.328
Your Girl Power segment
is a bust.

06:48.328 --> 06:50.791
Finito. Nada.

06:50.791 --> 06:52.493
I'm a loser
in many languages.

06:52.493 --> 06:53.914
Got it.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.797
But we do have
a different opportunity.

06:56.797 --> 06:59.129
Our biggest show,
 Quincy's Quintuplets,

06:59.129 --> 07:01.131
was just cancelled.
Big scandal.

07:01.131 --> 07:03.634
Turns out the quints
were actually triplets
and two cousins.

07:03.634 --> 07:06.717
No wonder two of them kept
calling their mom Aunt Jess.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.849
The timing of this
couldn't be better,

07:08.849 --> 07:10.811
because we think
we just found

07:10.811 --> 07:13.724
our next big family.
You!

07:16.557 --> 07:18.358
We'll call it
 The Diaz of Our Lives:

07:18.358 --> 07:19.940
Nine Times the Fabulous.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.942
This family, on TV?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.774
Where you can rewind
and rewatch?

07:23.774 --> 07:26.236
Thanks, but no.

07:26.236 --> 07:28.529
But your family's so real.
People love real.

07:28.529 --> 07:30.531
Everyone's gonna wanna
be a Diaz.

07:30.531 --> 07:33.574
Really? Because most day,
I'm not sure I do.

07:33.574 --> 07:36.917
Look, Girl Power was one shot
to show your inventions.

07:36.917 --> 07:39.580
Here, they'll be featured
in every episode.

07:39.580 --> 07:42.963
You'll be a girl
inventor hero.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.845
I'm definitely a girl.

07:44.845 --> 07:46.547
I am an inventor.

07:46.547 --> 07:48.088
Hero? We'll let
the fans decide.

07:48.088 --> 07:49.720
We're in.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.301
Sorry, but that's a no.

07:51.301 --> 07:52.763
Definitely not.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.015
Sure, sure.
I get it.

07:55.015 --> 07:57.227
I just thought the extra cash
could come in handy.

07:57.227 --> 08:00.360
You know, seven weddings,
seven college funds.

08:00.360 --> 08:01.562
A retirement home
in Hawaii.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.103
BOTH: We're in.

08:03.103 --> 08:04.695
Because of the college thing.

08:04.695 --> 08:07.698
Looks like the Diazes
are going to be on TV.

08:07.698 --> 08:09.870
Pick-Me-Up, let's dance.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.287
Okay, first rule:
no dancing on the show.

08:18.378 --> 08:19.379
Yeah.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.256
Enjoy your nutritious,
whole grain cereal

08:26.256 --> 08:28.048
with organic milk, Harley.

08:28.048 --> 08:29.800
Or as we like to call it
in the Diaz house,

08:29.800 --> 08:32.803
just an average,
ordinary breakfast.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.895
( whispers )
Dial it back, Mom.

08:36.636 --> 08:39.229
Oh, spoon.
( shrieks )

08:39.229 --> 08:40.640
Just be natural.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.022
Do what you normally do.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.815
Okay, normally,
I'd get spoons,

08:44.815 --> 08:46.486
but I don't normally
have a camera guy

08:46.486 --> 08:48.358
spooning me
while I do it.

08:48.358 --> 08:51.491
Oh, no ding on you, Ken.
You actually seem very nice.

08:51.491 --> 08:54.825
BT Dubs, you have
something weird in your teeth.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.997
Okay, I can't use
any of that.

08:56.997 --> 08:57.958
Please don't talk to Ken.

08:59.870 --> 09:04.084
Yeah, Harley, just pretend
there are no cameras around.

09:09.630 --> 09:11.882
Say a guy doesn't wanna be
on camera too much.

09:11.882 --> 09:14.054
Is there a place he could go
to, say, escape them?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.555
There are no cameras
in the bathrooms.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.267
Then that's where
I'll be spending my time.

09:17.267 --> 09:18.438
Like that's new for you.

09:19.730 --> 09:21.852
Dude, all I ask is that
you don't make me out

09:21.852 --> 09:23.894
to be the bumbling dad.

09:23.894 --> 09:24.815
Please don't
talk to Ken.

09:26.897 --> 09:28.859
Who's worried about
the cameras?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.241
I'm just a regular mom
doing regular things

09:31.241 --> 09:32.993
with grace and style.

09:36.787 --> 09:39.289
Oh, no. Mom's going
to court again.

09:39.289 --> 09:42.462
Court?
Why would you say that?

09:42.462 --> 09:44.665
You always wear
that dress when you
fight a speeding ticket.

09:44.665 --> 09:47.417
Yeah, that's your
speeding ticket dress.

09:47.417 --> 09:51.211
It's not. I don't.
( stammering )

09:51.211 --> 09:53.764
Ken, would you just mind
erasing that last little bit

09:53.764 --> 09:56.056
- for me, please.
- Please don't talk to Ken.

09:58.979 --> 10:01.061
I need this show
to go well.

10:01.061 --> 10:02.773
I'm applying for
a community grant

10:02.773 --> 10:04.725
to start an afterschool
sports program at the park.

10:04.725 --> 10:07.067
This exposure could be
a slam dunk.

10:07.067 --> 10:09.069
Home run?
Touchdown.

10:09.069 --> 10:10.901
We haven't settled
on a sport.

10:10.901 --> 10:14.655
There's a very simple formula
to being a reality TV star.

10:14.655 --> 10:18.739
Gossip plus drama
equals screen time.

10:18.739 --> 10:21.241
I don't know much gossip.

10:21.241 --> 10:23.914
Oh, Tammy Basford
shrunk her basketball uniform,

10:23.914 --> 10:25.916
and said the cleaners did it.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.417
I better just say
Tammy B.

10:27.417 --> 10:29.129
It's too incriminating.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.211
Are you trying
to get eliminated?

10:31.211 --> 10:32.923
There's eliminations?

10:32.923 --> 10:34.424
Keep it up
and there will be.

10:34.424 --> 10:37.097
You gotta dish
the real dirt.

10:37.097 --> 10:39.099
Wait, you wouldn't dish
on our family.

10:39.099 --> 10:41.561
Shouldn't those secrets
stay inside the clubhouse?

10:41.561 --> 10:44.314
You need to stop thinking
about them as family,

10:44.314 --> 10:47.647
and more as
stepping stones
to a spinoff.

10:50.030 --> 10:52.032
Hold on to your hat
for this part,

10:52.032 --> 10:53.864
because I think we have
lightning in a bottle.

10:53.864 --> 10:56.907
Pick-Me-Up,
pick up the clips.

10:59.239 --> 11:03.243
That was all thanks to
the positive displacement
of this vacuum pump.

11:03.243 --> 11:06.586
All the science stuff,
it's fab.

11:06.586 --> 11:08.288
Really. But our audience,

11:08.288 --> 11:10.751
they're girls who want
something totes fab.

11:10.751 --> 11:13.003
Oh, should I do
game show hands?

11:13.003 --> 11:14.384
I'll do game show hands.

11:15.505 --> 11:17.387
You need to zhoosh it up.

11:17.387 --> 11:19.219
Oh, right. Zhoosh.

11:19.219 --> 11:21.681
I have no idea
what that means.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.184
It means you need to add
a little glam.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.186
A vacuum is boring.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.519
What if it was
a vacuum and...

11:29.519 --> 11:31.772
a makeup caddy?

11:31.772 --> 11:33.984
But why would you want
your makeup stuck to something

11:33.984 --> 11:36.316
that cleans Dad's
toe clippings off the floor?

11:36.316 --> 11:37.988
Don't overthink it.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.699
If you want girls to be
excited about inventing,

11:39.699 --> 11:41.822
you need to speak
their language.

11:41.822 --> 11:43.914
I have to speak zhoosh.

11:43.914 --> 11:45.956
You are smart.

11:45.956 --> 11:49.039
And do you mind looping
Daphne into your story?

11:49.039 --> 11:51.131
She's not gonna be the adorable
breakout we thought.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.256
Stranger danger!
Get away from me, Ken.

11:56.256 --> 11:58.678
Please don't
talk to Ken.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.052
MISHA: Okay, girls, confessional
is where you talk to the camera

12:02.052 --> 12:05.015
and give us
your inner thoughts.

12:05.015 --> 12:08.018
I think you already know
that I'm thinking.

12:08.018 --> 12:11.611
Well, maybe your little
friend has something to say.

12:11.611 --> 12:14.354
She's not too sharp,
is she?

12:14.354 --> 12:16.987
Moving on. Harley.

12:16.987 --> 12:20.160
I don't know if I can
do this talking to camera thing.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.701
It's just not me.

12:21.701 --> 12:24.624
It's totally weird,
right?

12:24.624 --> 12:27.747
Our childhood continued.
Beast and Lewie.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.130
Year one, month five.

12:30.130 --> 12:32.042
Guys, what are
you doing?

12:32.042 --> 12:33.874
I'd like you to talk about
what's happening

12:33.874 --> 12:35.545
in the family now.

12:35.545 --> 12:38.088
But by the time
our parents had us,

12:38.088 --> 12:40.220
they were too busy
to take videos.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.472
We wanna make sure
we document our childhoods

12:42.472 --> 12:44.184
before they slip away.

12:44.184 --> 12:47.147
Yeah, I'd like to have
something to show my kids.

12:47.147 --> 12:50.100
Top favorite arm farts.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.392
Basic fudge squeak.

12:52.392 --> 12:54.064
I love sports.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.776
That's why I applied for
a community grant--

12:56.776 --> 12:58.278
This is reality TV.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.070
Nobody cares about good deeds.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.532
Okay, you want the deets
on the Diaz clan.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.865
Mom's secret meatball recipe
is actually from

13:04.865 --> 13:06.666
the frozen food section
at the store.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.458
Rachel, Mom
won't like--

13:08.458 --> 13:11.331
Not the good store;
the store where they
mostly sell hardware.

13:11.331 --> 13:14.084
- What happened
to your vacuum?
- I zhooshed it.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.838
Zsoosh? Did you just
swear at me?

13:17.838 --> 13:20.220
No. See, now
the Pick-Me-Up

13:20.220 --> 13:22.472
is a vacuum cleaner
and a makeup caddy.

13:22.472 --> 13:24.554
So you can vacuum
and have your lip gloss handy.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.056
Why?

13:26.056 --> 13:27.557
Because that's what
girls like.

13:27.557 --> 13:31.061
I'm a girl,
and I don't like it.

13:32.933 --> 13:35.105
Where was I? Oh, right.
Month five.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.527
I stared at
my stuffed bear

13:37.527 --> 13:39.739
through the bars
of my crib...

13:39.739 --> 13:42.152
Triple flutter blast.

13:42.152 --> 13:44.244
I cried out
for my parents,

13:44.244 --> 13:46.406
but all I heard was

13:46.406 --> 13:47.948
MISHA: Okay, boys.

13:47.948 --> 13:50.160
Carolina downwind.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.501
We're good here.

13:51.501 --> 13:53.874
I'm gonna start with
the song I wrote.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.665
It's about the point
in your life

13:55.665 --> 13:57.297
when you go from boy
to man.

13:57.297 --> 13:59.759
I call this "Dodgeball."

13:59.759 --> 14:01.421
One, two, three, four--

14:01.421 --> 14:03.133
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.724
I haven't played
anything yet.

14:04.724 --> 14:07.347
Perfect. We only get one chance
to launch you as an artist,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.729
and we wanna surround you
with the best available talent.

14:09.729 --> 14:11.271
That sounds good.

14:11.271 --> 14:15.355
- Really?
- I'm gonna play the drums.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.397
I'm gonna play
arm farts.

14:17.397 --> 14:20.530
Wait. Is there room
for two arm fartists?

14:22.152 --> 14:23.783
Harley, that is amazing.

14:23.783 --> 14:26.366
Girls are going to love
the Pretty-Go-Round.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.748
Thanks. I worked
really hard and...

14:28.748 --> 14:32.752
- What did you just call it?
- Pretty-Go-Round.

14:32.752 --> 14:34.955
But that doesn't say
anything about what
it's supposed to do.

14:34.955 --> 14:37.207
According to research,
the name tested very highly.

14:37.207 --> 14:39.259
Really?

14:39.259 --> 14:41.001
Well, I am a scientist.

14:41.001 --> 14:42.462
Can't argue with research.

14:42.462 --> 14:44.264
Here's the thing.

14:44.264 --> 14:47.007
You've done such a great job
with the Pretty-Go-Round

14:47.007 --> 14:49.389
that I think it's stealing
focus from you.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.352
Nice work.
You've been upstaged

14:52.352 --> 14:54.774
by something that sucks dirt.

14:54.774 --> 14:56.606
It's also a makeup caddy.

14:56.606 --> 14:58.818
You sleep on a dog bed.

14:58.818 --> 15:00.360
At least I own it.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.362
What I'm saying is, this...

15:02.362 --> 15:04.284
doesn't go with this.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.988
Anyway, here's your script
for when you present

15:07.988 --> 15:10.160
- the Pretty-Go-Round
in your new look.
- What new look?

15:15.295 --> 15:19.169
You look like you just
fell out of a unicorn's butt.

15:24.804 --> 15:26.886
Hey, chickadees,
your BFF Harley here

15:26.886 --> 15:29.549
with a hot scoop
on my latest invention.

15:29.549 --> 15:31.351
The Pretty-Go-Round.

15:31.351 --> 15:33.853
Isn't it totes cute?

15:33.853 --> 15:36.016
Don't you love, love, love it?

15:36.016 --> 15:38.438
It's also
a fabulistic vacuum.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.230
Peep this.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.821
Pick up the clip.

15:43.863 --> 15:45.235
Pick up the clip.

15:47.027 --> 15:49.369
Pick up the clip!

15:52.832 --> 15:54.744
I said clip, not lip.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.379
What am I doing?

16:01.381 --> 16:03.463
All the girl power
in the world doesn't matter

16:03.463 --> 16:04.634
if you lose the girl.

16:05.925 --> 16:08.258
I said girl, not curl.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.431
When they brought up
the idea of a boy band,

16:11.431 --> 16:13.263
I was skeptical.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.765
But every musician
has to start somewhere.

16:15.765 --> 16:19.399
And it looks like I'm starting
with Buenos Three-az.

16:19.399 --> 16:21.861
Okay, guys,
like they taught us.

16:21.861 --> 16:23.523
Five, six, seven, eight--

16:23.523 --> 16:25.485
Wait. I missed
one through four.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.608
I have a feeling that's not
gonna matter. Hit it.

16:31.161 --> 16:34.034
( computerized voices )

16:40.830 --> 16:43.293
Who needs guitar rock
when you can do...

16:43.293 --> 16:45.925
whatever the heck that was.

16:45.925 --> 16:48.388
- And Ethan--
- Rachel, stop.

16:48.388 --> 16:49.929
Ethan once wrote
Zayn from One Direction

16:49.929 --> 16:51.721
for hair advice,
and my dad--

16:51.721 --> 16:53.263
Rachel, can I have
a word with you?

16:56.096 --> 16:57.727
What you're doing
is not okay.

16:57.727 --> 16:59.849
Good. Then
I'm doing it right.

16:59.849 --> 17:02.352
This is our family.
You can't just keep
spilling their secrets.

17:02.352 --> 17:04.604
You don't hear me telling
everyone Mom takes pictures

17:04.604 --> 17:07.567
of our school photos
so she doesn't have
to buy them.

17:07.567 --> 17:11.201
You can't hear us out here,
can you?

17:12.492 --> 17:14.114
( sighs heavily )

17:14.114 --> 17:16.616
( both shriek )

17:16.616 --> 17:18.417
Harley?!

17:18.417 --> 17:20.960
What are you doing?

17:20.960 --> 17:23.833
Oh, you know,
just taking a bath.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.375
With no water.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.877
And in my clothes.

17:27.877 --> 17:30.550
- Whose clothes?
- I don't even know anymore.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.342
Scoot over.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.344
( sighs )

17:36.556 --> 17:40.600
It's hard being real
on a reality show, huh?

17:40.600 --> 17:42.522
Yeah.

17:42.522 --> 17:44.564
The me they're
telling me to be,

17:44.564 --> 17:47.107
I don't know how to be.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.899
Honey, all you
have to be is you.

17:49.899 --> 17:51.991
You're great.

17:51.991 --> 17:53.903
The thing is,

17:53.903 --> 17:56.956
I don't think I wanna be
on this show anymore.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.161
But everyone else
is loving it.

18:01.161 --> 18:03.413
Come on.

18:09.549 --> 18:11.511
You're hiding
in here, too?

18:11.511 --> 18:14.514
- What are you wearing?
- What are you wearing?

18:14.514 --> 18:16.976
Things didn't exactly
turn out like we planned.

18:16.976 --> 18:19.098
Wait, I thought
I was the lead singer.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.271
MISHA: Unless you're
an animated raccoon,

18:21.271 --> 18:22.642
you thought wrong.

18:22.642 --> 18:24.684
You're the backup singers.

18:24.684 --> 18:27.227
Why don't you guys
clear out?

18:27.227 --> 18:29.489
We're gonna do one
with just the raccoon.

18:31.401 --> 18:32.942
Insulting.

18:32.942 --> 18:34.784
Very.

18:34.784 --> 18:38.238
I'd like to think I can sing
better than most raccoons.

18:38.238 --> 18:39.619
RACHEL: We'll be right back.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.411
We're just going to
the bathroom.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.453
Together like girls do.

18:43.453 --> 18:46.085
Harley, you look amazing.

18:46.085 --> 18:47.667
Which makes this
hard to say.

18:47.667 --> 18:50.300
We don't wanna do
the show anymore.

18:50.300 --> 18:54.013
Okay, here's something
super embarrassing.
Last summer, Harley--

18:54.013 --> 18:55.755
Rachel sucks her thumb
when she's nervous.

18:55.755 --> 18:57.427
- What?!
- She did it last night.

18:57.427 --> 19:00.019
You people have cameras;
show the video.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.563
That's right.
I just won reality TV.

19:06.065 --> 19:08.478
I never thought a win
would make me feel so bad.

19:08.478 --> 19:11.401
For the record,
I did win though.

19:12.862 --> 19:15.695
Hey, what's everyone
doing in my room?

19:15.695 --> 19:17.657
We all want out
of the show.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.539
Guess I'm the only one
who didn't look bad.

19:19.539 --> 19:21.661
I was afraid I was gonna be
the bumbling dad,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.663
- but it's been okay.
- ( sighs )

19:23.663 --> 19:26.956
But if the family's not happy,
we're quitting the show.

19:26.956 --> 19:28.588
Don't we have
a three-year contract?

19:28.588 --> 19:30.049
What did the lawyer say?

19:30.049 --> 19:31.671
Lawyer? What lawyer?

19:33.092 --> 19:35.635
Oh, I am the bumbling dad.

19:35.635 --> 19:37.887
So we're stuck for
the next three years?

19:40.560 --> 19:42.602
Sorry. My bad.

19:42.602 --> 19:44.474
I was leaning on
the Pick-Me-Up.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.516
Pretty-Go-Round.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.518
Wow. Stuff's happened.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.233
Where's the stinkin'
off button on this thing?

19:53.233 --> 19:56.025
Oh, it's under
the vacuum's wig.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.818
Why would a vacuum
have a wig?

19:58.818 --> 20:00.159
Not the time.

20:01.661 --> 20:05.825
I think I just found our
"get out of zhoosh free" card.

20:07.827 --> 20:10.880
Can't a girl just
go to the bathroom anymore?

20:12.422 --> 20:14.003
You can't quit.

20:14.003 --> 20:17.006
The Diaz of Our Lives show
is going to be gold.

20:17.006 --> 20:19.719
Yeah, but our family's
signing on to a new show.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.601
It's called
 We're Done Here.

20:21.601 --> 20:24.053
Oh, wait. Let me
zhoosh that up for you.

20:24.053 --> 20:26.516
We're totes out.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.688
Not sure what channel's
that on,

20:28.688 --> 20:31.020
but you have a three-year
binding contract with us.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.442
Sorry.

20:32.442 --> 20:34.614
Okay.

20:34.614 --> 20:37.617
Then sit back and enjoy
some behind-the-scenes video

20:37.617 --> 20:39.449
my Pick-Me-Up happened to
pick up.

20:39.449 --> 20:41.701
Pretty-Go-Round.
What do you mean, video?

20:41.701 --> 20:43.703
It's a vacuum.

20:43.703 --> 20:46.326
With a voice-activated camera
that was there the whole time,

20:46.326 --> 20:48.418
underneath all the zhoosh.

20:48.418 --> 20:52.211
Turns out, my vacuum picked up
more than one kind of dirt.

20:53.673 --> 20:55.755
Yeah, I know
 it's a reality show,

20:55.755 --> 20:58.548
but no one has to know
 the storylines are fake.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.880
We make stuff up
 to get ratings.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.762
Of course the boys
 aren't a band.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.724
The audience is dumb.
 They won't know.

21:04.724 --> 21:08.308
Harley's invention?
 Boring.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.189
Girl Power?
 Yawn.

21:10.189 --> 21:12.392
Anyway, this isn't
 a reality show.

21:12.392 --> 21:14.103
It's a way to sell
 hair products.

21:16.396 --> 21:17.657
Good show, right?

21:17.657 --> 21:19.779
When I post it,
it's going to be gold.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.951
You know...

21:21.951 --> 21:24.574
I don't think
 Diaz of Our Lives
 is gonna work out.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.576
Oh. One last thing.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.668
I still want my segment
on Girl Power,

21:28.668 --> 21:30.670
with my original invention.

21:30.670 --> 21:33.122
Fine. ( huffs )

21:33.122 --> 21:35.585
I don't know why I decided
to do a show with smart girls.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.006
Ken, we're leaving.

21:37.006 --> 21:38.678
Please don't talk to Ken.

21:39.919 --> 21:41.631
My invention went from
 Pick-Me-Up

21:41.631 --> 21:43.593
to Pretty-Go-Round

21:43.593 --> 21:45.635
to bye-bye, TV crew,

21:45.635 --> 21:47.927
and that's real girl power.

21:47.927 --> 21:49.559
No zhoosh required.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.074

As much as
 it may be tempting

22:02.281 --> 22:05.034
to share your family
 with the world,

22:05.034 --> 22:07.617
sometimes it's better
 just to keep them to yourself.
