00:56.230 --> 00:59.059
- Daddy!

01:07.023 --> 01:08.024
My babies.

01:08.503 --> 01:11.071
-Mom? Mom!
- My babies, help!

01:14.509 --> 01:16.119
Mommy, come here.
There's a fire!

01:16.163 --> 01:17.381
There's a fire in there!

01:20.776 --> 01:22.430
Call the fire department!

01:26.608 --> 01:28.610
Yes. Hello,
I'd like to report fire.

01:30.264 --> 01:33.093
Yes, it's 1213 West 11th Street.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.968
Uh, yeah.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.970
It's my-- It's my neighbor's.

01:44.626 --> 01:47.716
Yes, there is...
There's babies in there.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.110
I don't know.

01:56.028 --> 01:57.552
There's been an explosion.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.165
Oh, my God.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.215
Please, God.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.305
-Please, let them be all right.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.698
Please, please, God.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.136
I'm sorry.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.413
It didn't start in here.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.114
What a sick puppy.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.037
Well, lookie here.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.649
He didn't take no chances.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.354
Check this out.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.837
Crazed glass.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.451
Kids' room.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.456
Piece of shit waited
'till they were asleep.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.595
So, he pours the accelerant
here.

04:08.465 --> 04:12.687
-And it flashes over.
-It goes straight out the door.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.777
-Right along that baseboard.
-Yup.

04:16.908 --> 04:18.170
Onto the porch.

04:19.954 --> 04:21.086
Son of a bitch.

04:21.783 --> 04:22.827
We'll nail him.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.356
Thank you for coming down,
folks.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.662
-I know how hard this must be.

04:32.184 --> 04:35.797
This is Mr. Fogg, Mr. Vasquez.
They're investigating the fire.

04:37.668 --> 04:38.887
Our condolences.

04:39.670 --> 04:40.976
Y'all find out anything?

04:41.237 --> 04:42.760
We're still trying to find
our way.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.894
Think you might be able to help
us figure out a couple things.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.156
Of course.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.290
It's Stacy, right?

04:52.204 --> 04:54.468
Now, you weren't in the house
at the time of the fire.

04:54.511 --> 04:55.512
That's right.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.298
She works nights sometimes,

04:58.341 --> 04:59.995
stopped on the way home
from work.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.565
Whereabouts was it you stopped,
darling?

05:09.744 --> 05:13.095
I stopped at the Salvation Army
to get the babies some presents.

05:16.707 --> 05:19.319
-At 9:00 in the morning?
-Well, Christmas is coming

05:19.362 --> 05:21.669
-and we're broke, so...
-Of course.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.324
How about the day before?

05:25.716 --> 05:27.370
Anything unusual happen?

05:29.677 --> 05:30.678
No, sir.

05:45.301 --> 05:46.389
Hey, there.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.870
How are my precious ladies?

05:49.479 --> 05:51.176
Ooh, why are you crying?

05:52.526 --> 05:54.136
They've been crying all fucking
morning.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.355
You girls are lucky.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.401
If your mama wasn't so pretty,
you three wouldn't be here.

05:58.445 --> 05:59.968
Oh, you fucking stink.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.970
What, do you think you can
just stay out all night

06:02.013 --> 06:03.275
and then come home
and sweet-talk me?

06:03.319 --> 06:04.755
Honey, I had a couple o' drinks.

06:05.277 --> 06:07.715
I already got one DUI,
so I stopped at Mikey's.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.415
-What?
-Nothing.

06:15.897 --> 06:16.985
Have at it.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.338
So, that night,
you went to work?

06:24.340 --> 06:26.560
Yeah, I work nights.
We need the money.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.605
And you stayed at home
with the kids?

06:28.649 --> 06:30.564
-You do that a lot?
-That's right.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.132
I guess I'm one of them
stay-at-home dads

06:34.176 --> 06:35.569
everybody's talking about.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.402
There's another dinner in the
oven if you're hungry.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.448
Who is it this time, Todd?

06:45.492 --> 06:46.406
Who was who?

06:48.190 --> 06:49.452
I already told you

06:49.496 --> 06:51.541
-where I was last night.
-You ain't told me shit.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.500
You think I'm stupid?
What the fuck is this?

06:53.935 --> 06:55.240
Baby, you're the one that said

06:55.284 --> 06:56.633
you don't wanna have
no more children.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.896
Then what's it doing in your
wallet, you bastard?

06:58.940 --> 06:59.810
I don't know.

07:01.377 --> 07:02.987
-I thought maybe surprise sex--
-You're such a fucking liar.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.207
I could smell the bitch on you
when you walked in this morning.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.210
-I'm not lying to you, honey.
-Mm-hmm. You ain't worth shit

07:08.253 --> 07:09.820
-for a husband.
-Bitch!

07:10.647 --> 07:13.041
I'm here every goddamn day
taking care of these kids.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.346
Oh, yeah? And why's that?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.393
Why are you here every goddamn
day taking care of these kids?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.222
Because you don't have
a fucking job, that's why.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.963
Because you are a fucking loser.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.747
Better shut the fuck up
that shit right now--

07:23.791 --> 07:25.140
Or what?

07:25.183 --> 07:26.750
-I swear to God, woman.
-You hit me again? Go on.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.100
Oh, yeah, that's right. You
can't hit me.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.885
Because if you do,
then I can't go to work,

07:30.928 --> 07:33.235
and I can't make you money
to go out drinking and fucking

07:33.278 --> 07:34.802
whatever the fuck else you do.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.678
So, Stacy went to work that
night and you just, uh,

07:41.983 --> 07:42.984
stayed in bed?

07:47.249 --> 07:48.250
Yes, sir.

07:48.598 --> 07:49.904
Had a few beers, maybe?

07:52.863 --> 07:53.864
No.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.214
Reckon your kids
sleep pretty sound?

07:57.389 --> 07:58.347
Usually.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.438
And then that night?

08:03.570 --> 08:04.745
It was morning.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.270
I was asleep, so I thought I
was dreaming at first.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.576
- Daddy!
-But then I realized

08:09.619 --> 08:12.013
I could hear Amber screaming,
"Daddy! Daddy!"

08:13.318 --> 08:14.581
Daddy!

08:17.845 --> 08:19.368
Everything was full of smoke.

08:19.411 --> 08:21.413
I couldn't see nothing
but black.

08:21.457 --> 08:22.676
It smelled like it did

08:22.719 --> 08:24.504
when the microwave
blowed up last month.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.549
-Fires, lights popping.
- Daddy!

08:26.593 --> 08:27.637
Girls!

08:27.985 --> 08:29.900
So, I made it to their room
and...

08:31.815 --> 08:33.774
I had to kick through
the child-proof thing.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.562
I never felt anything
so hot in my life.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.654
I thought I'd found Amber,
but she was gone.

08:44.698 --> 08:45.742
Amber.

08:48.658 --> 08:49.659
Girls.

08:50.921 --> 08:51.922
Amber!

08:52.662 --> 08:53.750
Girls!

08:54.751 --> 08:56.448
I couldn't take the heat, so...

08:57.275 --> 08:59.582
I had to get outside, catch my
breath.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.022
That's when I hollered out

09:05.066 --> 09:07.024
for my neighbor
to call emergency.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.645
Can you think of why anyone
would wanna hurt your family?

09:18.949 --> 09:19.950
No, sir.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.697
We had three
of the prettiest babies

09:27.741 --> 09:29.220
anybody could've asked for.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.398
Off and on, we'd fight
and break up for a while,

09:33.442 --> 09:36.010
but it was always the babies
that brought us back together.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.056
Neither of us could've lived
without them kids.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.932
Sometimes, I wish Amber
had never woke me up.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.852
You know, Todd,
you've been in trouble before.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.942
-Yes, sir.
-A couple of those times

09:54.985 --> 09:56.596
when we asked you what happened,

09:56.639 --> 09:59.250
you didn't exactly tell the
truth, isn't that so?

10:00.556 --> 10:01.601
No, sir.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.734
But you're telling the truth
now?

10:04.778 --> 10:05.692
Yes, sir.

10:10.784 --> 10:14.178
Just as Jesus, the Lamb of God,
was taken too soon,

10:14.222 --> 10:16.528
so too were these three
innocents,

10:16.572 --> 10:18.705
taken back to the bosom
of the Lord.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.708
How else are we to understand

10:21.751 --> 10:25.537
the loss of Amber, Karmen,
and Kameron.

10:31.282 --> 10:34.111
Do you wanna stop somewhere
and maybe get...

10:35.069 --> 10:36.766
-something to eat?
-Cameron Todd Willingham,

10:36.810 --> 10:38.638
I don't wanna hear your voice.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.509
And maybe never again.

10:41.902 --> 10:45.209
-I'm hurting, too, baby--
-Did you hear a word I said?

10:45.253 --> 10:47.168
Oh, if you're gonna start
demonizing me,

10:47.211 --> 10:48.560
-speak to me like--
-I'll speak to you

10:48.604 --> 10:50.475
-however I please.
-You will not either.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.390
Baby, if we're ever gonna get
through this,

10:52.434 --> 10:54.349
-we gotta work together on--
-Stop the car.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.438
Stop the car,
let me out of the car.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.701
-Why? Why, what's the matter--
-Stop the car!

10:58.745 --> 11:01.269
-I won't stop the car--
-Stop the fucking car, Todd!

11:01.312 --> 11:03.663
-Tell me why.
-Let me out of the car!

11:03.706 --> 11:06.100
Stop the fucking car, Todd!

11:06.143 --> 11:08.450
-Let me out of the car!

11:08.493 --> 11:10.017
-Stop the fucking car!

11:10.060 --> 11:11.671
Those were my babies!

11:11.888 --> 11:15.196
Those were my babies
and you didn't save them!

11:15.239 --> 11:17.328
They were my babies!

11:17.764 --> 11:19.417
My babies, Todd!

11:32.909 --> 11:33.780
Driver!

11:35.259 --> 11:36.870
Exit the vehicle, put your hands
up where I can see them.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.001
Do it now!

11:41.570 --> 11:43.311
Turn around, face away from me.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.356
Interlace your hands
behind your head.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.098
Do not look back.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.497
Cameron Todd Willingham...

11:57.107 --> 11:58.630
you're under arrest for murder.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.241
-Murder?
- You come with me.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.025
-Who did I kill?
-Come on.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.679
We'll talk about it
at the station.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.596
Let's go, Todd.
You know the way.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.773
I only just buried them, Marty.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.603
This is some fucked up bullshit.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.561
Stand right there.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.353
Let's go.

12:32.882 --> 12:35.058
You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?

12:35.102 --> 12:36.407
Your own kids?

12:36.930 --> 12:39.193
-Jesus, man.
-I didn't do it, Marty.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.542
Fuck you!

12:40.585 --> 12:42.022
Hey, fuck you!

12:46.026 --> 12:47.984
Man, would you get
the fuck down from there?

12:48.028 --> 12:49.290
This ain't no fucking zoo!

12:50.334 --> 12:51.945
Jesus fucking Christ.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.991
You want a banana?
That'll make you calm down?

12:55.949 --> 12:57.515
They ain't gonna throw you no
fucking peanuts,

12:57.559 --> 12:58.647
you know that, right?

12:59.300 --> 13:00.823
Who're you talking to, boy?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.347
I was just talking
to that mullet,

13:03.391 --> 13:04.479
you know,
she's real cute.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.176
She gave me a little wink,
you know.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.659
-This yours?
-Hey.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.143
Yours?

13:29.939 --> 13:30.940
Get up.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.551
Look, I'm good, man.
I was just fucking around.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.120
You ain't gotta take shit
so personal.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.863
You smell like you wanna be left
alone.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.871
If you plead guilty,
you might live.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.091
I'm not confessing
to something I didn't do.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.745
I'll say any goddamn thing
you like,

13:53.789 --> 13:55.660
but I will not say
I killed my own kids.

13:55.704 --> 13:56.923
With the evidence they got,

13:56.966 --> 13:58.533
-they're gonna--
-I'm going to take the stand

13:58.576 --> 14:00.665
and I'm gonna talk to the judge
about it.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.450
Idiot, they will tear you up
on the stand.

14:02.493 --> 14:03.407
Oh, they better.

14:04.582 --> 14:05.670
Boy, you're about as
dumb as you look--

14:05.714 --> 14:06.802
What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.021
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Todd, calm down.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.457
Oh, listen to him!

14:12.329 --> 14:14.157
They wanna kill me? Good.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.638
They better start
digging my grave now,

14:16.681 --> 14:19.467
because I'll die before I say
I killed my own kids.

14:19.510 --> 14:23.558
Boy, I am the only thing between
you and the needle right now.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.213
No way in hell
I'm putting you on that stand.

14:28.084 --> 14:31.827
Good morning,
Texas. This is KZYZ.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.569
The phone lines are burning up.
Let's hear from you.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.527
I never liked him.
I always thought there was

14:36.571 --> 14:37.833
something kind of
off about him,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.182
and it doesn't surprise me
a little bit.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.880
They should fry him.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.098
-He needs to burn in hell.
- What kind of daddy

14:42.142 --> 14:43.578
would kill his own babies
like that?

14:43.621 --> 14:44.666
Things like this
don't happen here.

14:44.709 --> 14:45.667
Hey, I'll shoot him myself.

14:45.710 --> 14:46.886
Boy took three innocent lives.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.322
The only thing I regret is,

14:48.365 --> 14:50.324
we can't kill him
three times over.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.108
Members of the jury,

14:52.152 --> 14:54.023
I'd like you to take a look

14:54.067 --> 14:57.461
at the sweet faces
of these beautiful babies...

14:58.114 --> 15:00.682
Karmen and Kameron,
barely a year old

15:01.074 --> 15:03.598
and already brimming with life.

15:04.425 --> 15:08.168
Little Amber, eagerly waiting
for Santa's visit

15:08.472 --> 15:10.126
in only two days.

15:11.911 --> 15:15.305
Now, I want you to imagine
these little angels...

15:15.349 --> 15:17.829
-...burning in their beds.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.920
This was no arson.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.748
This was murder.

15:25.141 --> 15:28.449
Well, I barely poked my head
out the door when...

15:30.190 --> 15:33.584
he just stood there with
a strange look in his eyes--

15:33.628 --> 15:35.847
-That's total bullshit.
- Shut up.

15:36.587 --> 15:39.503
To the best of your knowledge,
did Todd Willingham

15:39.547 --> 15:42.942
ever make an attempt
to get back in that house?

15:44.421 --> 15:46.510
He was too worried about that
car of his.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.514
He didn't try to save those kids
till the cops showed up.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.518
And it was like he was...
putting on a show.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.740
Fire talks to you,
it does not lie.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.785
Then what did that fire
tell you?

16:00.829 --> 16:04.050
That it was deliberately set
by human hands.

16:06.226 --> 16:07.531
Can you be more specific?

16:09.011 --> 16:11.144
Someone poured gasoline
through those children's room,

16:11.187 --> 16:14.408
even under their bed
in the shape of a pentagram,

16:14.451 --> 16:15.844
the symbol of the devil.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.934
He kept pouring down the hallway
to the front door,

16:19.152 --> 16:21.981
creating a fire barrier,
preventing any escape.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.160
That fire was hotter
than the hinges of hell.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.250
We found evidence
of what we call crazed glass,

16:30.293 --> 16:32.904
another indication it was goosed
by liquid additive.

16:33.253 --> 16:36.734
Worst of all, the refrigerator
was moved to block the backdoor.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.302
Someone made that house
into a death trap.

16:39.694 --> 16:43.872
Inspector Vasquez, how many
arson cases have you worked on?

16:43.915 --> 16:45.917
I reckon more than 1,200 fires.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.484
And to the best
of your knowledge,

16:48.050 --> 16:49.747
have you ever been
mistaken?

16:50.139 --> 16:53.012
Sir, fire does not destroy
evidence, it creates it.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.884
If I've ever been wrong,
it's never been pointed out.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.148
Mr. Horton?

16:59.844 --> 17:00.976
No questions, Your Honor.

17:03.805 --> 17:07.939
Mr. Webb, you shared a cell
with Todd Willingham

17:07.983 --> 17:11.030
at the Navarro County Jail,
is that correct?

17:11.595 --> 17:12.640
Yes, sir.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.817
And what did he tell you
at that time?

17:17.949 --> 17:18.819
Well, he...

17:19.646 --> 17:20.952
He said that...

17:21.910 --> 17:26.132
he came home
and that one of his children

17:26.175 --> 17:29.135
was hurt or even dead
or whatever.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.789
-What?
-And then so, he started--

17:31.833 --> 17:35.141
He decided that he was gonna
cover it up by starting a fire.

17:35.184 --> 17:36.533
Hell no.

17:37.317 --> 17:40.537
Did he tell you who it was
that injured that child?

17:41.408 --> 17:43.018
He did. He said it was his wife.

17:43.453 --> 17:44.498
-What?
-Yeah.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.326
He said she was crying,
yeah,

17:46.369 --> 17:48.197
and carrying on
with such emotion.

17:48.241 --> 17:52.201
He just decided to take some
paper and wad it up,

17:52.245 --> 17:55.204
and then he burnt it in a way
that made it look like

17:55.248 --> 17:57.163
them children was playing
with it and such.

17:57.206 --> 18:00.862
And did Willingham ever threaten
you about telling anybody

18:00.905 --> 18:02.907
-what he had told you?
-Yeah.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.910
He pointed his finger at me
and did like this.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.086
I'll kill you.

18:08.565 --> 18:09.827
-Thank you, Mr. Webb.
-Y'all need to start speaking

18:09.871 --> 18:11.307
some fucking truth around here!

18:11.351 --> 18:12.743
-Calm down. You just sit down.
-I am!

18:12.787 --> 18:13.875
No, no, this is corrupt.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.137
Don't believe that shit.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.530
That shit never happened, Judge.

18:16.573 --> 18:17.792
Control your client.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.054
-Counselor.
- That shit didn't happen.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.926
-Counselor.
-You took an oath, didn't you?

18:21.970 --> 18:23.711
Start speaking some
fucking truth then, boy.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.409
-This is my courtroom, sir.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.933
Mr. Jackson,
call your next witness.

18:29.412 --> 18:33.068
Mr. Evans,
you have firsthand knowledge

18:33.112 --> 18:36.898
of Todd Willingham's history
of violent behavior, don't you?

18:36.941 --> 18:38.029
Yes, sir.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.161
Would you explain to us

18:39.205 --> 18:40.815
what transpired
between the two of you?

18:41.337 --> 18:44.819
I mean, maybe me and Stacy
was flirting a little,

18:45.211 --> 18:46.429
but it ain't mean nothing.

18:47.996 --> 18:51.391
Hell, Stacy, she's like that,
and Todd sort of liked it.

18:51.782 --> 18:54.307
Wasn't no reason
to beat the crap outta me.

18:54.698 --> 18:55.830
Sorry, Your Honor.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.702
Beat me half to death.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.923
But Mr. Willingham's propensity

19:01.966 --> 19:04.926
for violence also found its way
into his home.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.537
Busted lip, black eyes...

19:09.017 --> 19:10.497
bruises all over her legs.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.458
Oh, and a red mark on her
stomach where he kicked her.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.112
Now, Mrs. King...

19:18.244 --> 19:20.333
did she say what she believed

19:20.376 --> 19:23.466
the cause of those beatings
to be?

19:23.510 --> 19:24.511
Yes, sir.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.861
Stacy was pregnant

19:26.904 --> 19:28.863
and Todd wanted to make her
have a miscarriage.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.050
Is Cathy King's testimony
correct?

19:43.269 --> 19:45.358
-No, sir.
-So, Todd didn't beat you up

19:45.401 --> 19:47.229
when he found out
you were pregnant

19:47.273 --> 19:48.491
and tried to force you
to abort?

19:48.883 --> 19:49.971
No, sir.

19:50.537 --> 19:51.929
He even came with me
to the doctor

19:51.973 --> 19:53.366
when I was pregnant
with them twins.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.194
He was excited
it might be a boy.

19:56.151 --> 19:59.981
So, the testimony we've heard
about the beatings,

20:00.024 --> 20:00.895
the obscenities?

20:02.113 --> 20:03.506
I'm not saying Todd and I
didn't fight,

20:03.550 --> 20:05.204
but I gave him just as many
bruises as he gave me.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.252
Is it true that the police

20:10.296 --> 20:13.299
were called to your home
to control a situation

20:13.342 --> 20:16.345
where Todd Willingham was
intoxicated

20:16.389 --> 20:21.524
and calling you a, quote,
"Whore, bitch, and slut?"

20:23.091 --> 20:25.267
Yeah. We was always arguing,
it didn't mean nothing.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.355
People argue.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.793
Despite the many occasions

20:30.098 --> 20:32.796
that he behaved
in such a violent manner,

20:32.840 --> 20:34.624
how can you be so sure

20:35.059 --> 20:36.539
that he didn't commit this
crime?

20:36.583 --> 20:38.846
Because he loved those babies.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.544
And he loves me.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.242
Mrs. Willingham,

20:44.417 --> 20:48.072
are you telling us
that all of these witnesses

20:48.116 --> 20:52.251
who have testified to your
husband's violent abuse of you

20:53.034 --> 20:54.340
are just lying?

20:57.125 --> 20:58.169
I don't know.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.955
Do you have any idea why
they would lie?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.393
No.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.833
Now, you were raised
by your grandmother.

21:12.227 --> 21:15.274
Your mother was a victim
of family violence, wasn't she?

21:23.369 --> 21:24.283
Mm-hmm.

21:25.414 --> 21:26.285
Can you tell us
what happened to her?

21:26.589 --> 21:27.634
Objection.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.853
-Irrelevant, Your Honor.
-Overruled.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.855
The witness will
answer the question.

21:32.508 --> 21:33.770
Mrs. Willingham?

21:35.816 --> 21:36.904
She was...

21:38.645 --> 21:40.516
I'm sorry.
Can you speak up, please?

21:46.348 --> 21:47.218
She was killed.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.003
By your father?

21:53.660 --> 21:54.617
Yes.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.408
No further questions.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.715
You don't understand,
Todd is not like that.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.718
Todd would never do anything
to hurt those babies.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.677
He loved those babies
with all his heart.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.983
He treated those babies
better than anybody else did.

22:13.027 --> 22:15.334
He would feed them
and change their diapers,

22:15.377 --> 22:18.467
and he potty-trained them,
and you are not listening.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.382
-The witness will step down.
-Everybody in here

22:20.426 --> 22:22.515
making up lies, no one's paying
attention to the fact,

22:22.558 --> 22:24.386
no one's telling the fucking
truth!

22:24.430 --> 22:26.388
-The witness is excused.
-No one accepts the truth

22:26.432 --> 22:27.955
or listening to anything
we're saying.

22:27.998 --> 22:29.565
- Young lady--
-When do we get a chance

22:29.609 --> 22:30.479
to say the truth?

22:32.046 --> 22:33.264
- You will step down.
-I'm sorry, Todd. I'm sorry.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.662
Mr. Horton,
call your next witness.

22:39.706 --> 22:42.622
-Your Honor, the defense rests.
-Are we all clear

22:42.665 --> 22:44.319
-on what was just said then?
-Todd.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.538
Now, hold on a minute.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.017
Before they started
digging up her past,

22:47.061 --> 22:48.976
-y'all were clear on that.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.500
This is the worst kind of crime
there is.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.589
And there's been people
called up to this stand

22:53.633 --> 22:56.505
to lie about me, people who
just don't like me anyway.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.725
I just wanna make sure
I get a fair trial, Judge.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.509
I wash my hands of this,
Your Honor.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.381
Ain't that how this shit works?

23:02.424 --> 23:04.861
Now, I've sat here and stayed
quiet while y'all paint

23:04.905 --> 23:06.472
the worst possible
picture of me.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.604
Ain't I got a right to respond,
Judge?

23:08.648 --> 23:10.084
Well done, son. Well done.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.564
-Sit down. Sit down.
-Where are my friends?

23:11.607 --> 23:13.435
- Mr. Jackson....
- Where are my family?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.872
-...call your next witness.
-People who can vouch for me.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.352
Sir, you need to calm down, sir.

23:17.396 --> 23:21.182
The jury will disregard
what they just saw and heard.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.880
Mr. Jackson,
proceed with your summation.

23:32.498 --> 23:36.763
"Whosoever shall harm
one of my children,

23:37.938 --> 23:42.421
it is better for a millstone to
be hung around his neck

23:43.117 --> 23:45.859
and for him to be cast
into the sea."

23:48.296 --> 23:49.645
Members of the jury,

23:50.603 --> 23:54.476
I ask that the words
of Mark 9:42

23:54.520 --> 23:57.174
remind you
of your responsibility...

23:58.262 --> 24:00.047
as they remind me of mine.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.093
Two days before Christmas,

24:04.007 --> 24:06.532
Willingham committed the
ultimate crime.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.232
Can there be a more
righteous case

24:11.624 --> 24:14.583
for the imposition
of the ultimate penalty?

24:17.281 --> 24:20.459
Now, whether capital punishment,

24:20.502 --> 24:23.244
in this case, will deter others,
I don't know,

24:23.287 --> 24:28.075
but I do know it will deter
Cameron Todd Willingham.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.033
And that is what
the State of Texas

24:30.077 --> 24:32.122
is asking you to do today.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.864
Willingham wrote his own
death sentence

24:34.908 --> 24:36.562
when he killed those children.

24:39.086 --> 24:42.785
It is your duty to carry it out.

24:55.450 --> 24:56.582
Sit down, boy.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.236
Only been 40 minutes.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.196
Liberation could take days.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.507
Jury is coming in.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.515
Has the jury panel
reached a verdict?

25:18.038 --> 25:18.952
Yes, sir.

25:20.170 --> 25:20.606
Would you pass it
to the bailiff?

25:32.835 --> 25:34.445
Will the defendant rise?

25:41.627 --> 25:44.412
By your verdict in this case,
you, the jury,

25:44.455 --> 25:48.547
have found the defendant,
Cameron Todd Willingham,

25:49.156 --> 25:51.941
guilty of the offense of
capital murder,

25:51.985 --> 25:54.422
as charged in the indictment.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.383
Cameron Todd Willingham,

25:59.993 --> 26:02.299
by order of the State of Texas,

26:03.605 --> 26:06.390
-you are sentenced to death.

26:09.742 --> 26:13.093
This is Tower 4. I got eyes on
our boy on the dog run.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.839
Hey, hey, what's up, homie?

26:32.416 --> 26:35.419
- Fuck you, get inside
- All right, baby killer.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.002
Now, this here is general
population.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.656
Get yourself a good hard look

26:54.700 --> 26:56.745
because you ain't never
gonna see a crowd again, boy.

26:56.789 --> 26:58.181
Hey, baby killer.

26:58.529 --> 27:01.489
Like killing babies?
Little bitch. You--

27:01.532 --> 27:02.621
Back up!

27:03.230 --> 27:04.710
Oh, you're a sweet one.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.450
You're gonna get yours,
baby killer.

27:11.717 --> 27:12.935
That's it, all right.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.764
The long walk to
the death chamber.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.725
The condemned, that's you,
baby killer,

27:20.290 --> 27:21.814
can have his family there,

27:22.162 --> 27:23.685
at least what's left of them
in your case.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.426
Ha-ha.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.080
You're gonna see it again,
I promise.

27:27.428 --> 27:30.561
-Welcome to death row.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.651
Yeah, I know you're listening,
baby killer.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.957
You wanna know what's coming,
you all do.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.046
It could be days.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.309
Shit, it could be years,
but somehow you guys

27:39.353 --> 27:41.007
-are always so surprised.
- Your move.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.270
It happens
just after your last meal.

27:43.313 --> 27:44.837
You can order any damn thing
you want.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.795
I've seen one poor guy
ask for candy.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.364
What about you,
baby killer? What's your poison?

27:50.407 --> 27:53.497
Oh, poison! Injection.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.369
You get it? Get your ass
in there.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.589
-Unhook him.
- Let's go.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.288
First, we strap your ass
to that table,

28:01.767 --> 28:04.204
and then one of us
puts in the IV.

28:04.247 --> 28:05.727
Of course,
we don't always get it right.

28:05.771 --> 28:06.815
Sometimes the fella lays there

28:06.859 --> 28:09.035
just screaming in agony
for hours,

28:09.078 --> 28:10.601
begging to be put out of
his misery.

28:10.645 --> 28:11.690
What if I'm innocent?

28:13.996 --> 28:15.345
Nobody ever done it,
baby killer.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.870
No, it was their best friend
who done it, or...

28:19.045 --> 28:20.786
he didn't know the gun was
loaded, or...

28:21.525 --> 28:23.005
he was just trying to scare 'em.

28:23.876 --> 28:26.400
But, damn, you,
you just stood there

28:26.443 --> 28:28.054
and watched them babies burn.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.795
Now, that's cold.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.193
That's what I'm gonna do
for you, baby killer.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.282
I'm gonna stay there and watch.

28:40.675 --> 28:42.808
And when they pump that shit
inside of you...

28:44.897 --> 28:47.595
you are gonna burn
from the inside out.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.031
A-107.

29:08.921 --> 29:09.878
Hey!

29:10.183 --> 29:11.924
You that Willingham fella?

29:14.578 --> 29:17.190
You the boy that
burned them babies?

29:20.323 --> 29:23.326
Hey, we got something special
for you.

29:33.554 --> 29:34.555
Up through there.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.428
Hey, it's the baby killer.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.128
-What's up, bitch?

29:42.171 --> 29:43.433
Stop, face the wall.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.828
You get one shower every two
days, that's it.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.662
We got a fight
in the shower block.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.800
- Hey, come here, boy.
- Get him.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.547
Don't you fucking move.

30:10.591 --> 30:11.897
You got him?
Are we good?

30:15.726 --> 30:17.816
Let's see how
you like some alone time, boy.

30:19.252 --> 30:20.601
Son of a bitch can bleed.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.603
Ain't too pretty anymore.

30:24.518 --> 30:27.129
-Make him your bitch.

30:28.478 --> 30:29.610
Pick his ass up.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.961
-Piece of shit.
-Come on, get up.

30:34.136 --> 30:36.051
"I'm sorry, boss", say it.

30:37.052 --> 30:37.966
Say it.

30:47.584 --> 30:48.847
"I'm sorry, boss."

30:51.371 --> 30:52.241
Say it.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.470
What the fuck for?

32:04.966 --> 32:08.578
Y'all are treating me worse
than a damn animal!

32:09.014 --> 32:11.712
I wouldn't even treat my dog
like this.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.541
Get the fuck out of here, Todd.

32:14.584 --> 32:15.890
Go back to the bar and find

32:15.934 --> 32:16.847
some girl to suck on your dick.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.110
Get the fuck out of here.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.329
Get the fuck out of here, Todd.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.766
Who are you
cheating on me with, bitch?

32:22.810 --> 32:25.073
Everybody in the fucking town.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.206
-What's his name?
-The fuck up.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.729
You fucking whore.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.339
Come on, Todd, that's enough.

32:31.297 --> 32:34.126
Come on, baby. I love you
so much, you know that.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.825
See, you're not so bad.

32:38.347 --> 32:40.871
-Come on, baby, it's okay.
-Don't you move.

32:49.706 --> 32:52.535
Come over here, baby.
Come on.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.322
We both fucked up and...

32:57.149 --> 32:58.672
you fucked up too.

33:02.328 --> 33:03.633
Daddy!

33:08.334 --> 33:10.205
Daddy!

33:19.171 --> 33:21.303
Help! Help me!

33:38.190 --> 33:40.061
Y'all, take me out of here.

33:44.674 --> 33:47.590
I promise
I won't do anything bad again.

33:50.550 --> 33:52.117
I promise I'll be good.

34:30.284 --> 34:33.375
Mr. Daniels, may I have a pen
and paper?

34:33.418 --> 34:34.507
Say please.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.161
May I have a pen and paper,
please?

34:40.643 --> 34:42.775
May I have a pen and paper,
please, sir?

35:02.187 --> 35:06.582
Dear Stacy, I don't understand
why you won't come visit me.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.977
I've had a lot of time to think
about our life together.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.241
"It already feels like
so long ago."

35:13.937 --> 35:15.765
Him again.
What's he want now?

35:15.809 --> 35:16.897
Grandma, lay off.

35:21.771 --> 35:23.599
"I have not been good.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.994
I suppose I'm paying for that
now.

35:28.735 --> 35:29.736
But why sh...

35:31.085 --> 35:33.609
Why should I be punished
for a thing I did not do?

35:35.829 --> 35:38.179
You know I would never hurt
those babies."

35:38.223 --> 35:39.920
You tell him to leave you be.

35:40.486 --> 35:43.271
He was a wicked child
that became a wicked man.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.099
And if you'd figured that out
a little sooner,

35:45.143 --> 35:46.840
I might still be a grandmother.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.537
If he killed anybody,
it would have been me.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.149
You know what,

35:52.541 --> 35:53.890
I'm gonna write a letter
to Governor Anne Richards

35:53.934 --> 35:55.022
and tell her how much he loved
his little girls.

35:55.065 --> 35:57.155
Well, that's just great, Stacy.

35:57.851 --> 35:59.505
I'm gonna go write a letter
to Santa.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.955
That's my favorite, Stacy.

36:15.434 --> 36:17.305
Oh, yeah? What a surprise.

36:20.743 --> 36:21.918
Who was that?

36:23.398 --> 36:25.879
You just look real nice
this time of day.

36:26.706 --> 36:27.968
Thank you, Todd.

36:29.361 --> 36:30.536
Wrote you a song.

36:31.276 --> 36:32.625
Oh, yeah?
How does it go?

36:32.668 --> 36:35.497
-Wanna hear it?
-Sure, why not?

36:37.978 --> 36:39.501
♪ Don't go to work

36:40.546 --> 36:42.069
♪ Don't put on your shirt

36:43.984 --> 36:46.639
♪ Leave it alone
That little skirt ♪

36:48.293 --> 36:49.816
♪ Come back to bed

36:50.860 --> 36:52.253
♪ Give a little head

36:54.777 --> 36:57.780
♪ We can spend our whole life
Rolling in the dirt ♪

36:59.739 --> 37:01.915
-Do you like it?
-I like some parts of it.

37:01.958 --> 37:04.309
-Which parts of it do you like?
-Take a wild guess.

37:04.918 --> 37:06.267
Rolling in the dirt?

37:07.050 --> 37:08.226
Before that.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.140
Part where you're nice
and sweet--

37:10.184 --> 37:11.490
What are you doing, Todd?

37:12.491 --> 37:13.927
Come on,
you're just trying to show off.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.276
One more time, come on.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.060
-I gotta go.
-Come on.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.240
You're like a 12-year-old boy.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.251
I give in.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.561
Dear Stacy,

37:41.128 --> 37:42.912
I don't understand why you
won't answer my letters.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.002
I know you can never get over
what happened,

37:46.046 --> 37:47.874
but I lost everything, too.

37:48.483 --> 37:52.618
Not just the kids
and you and our home,

37:52.966 --> 37:55.055
but pretty soon now, my life.

37:58.841 --> 38:01.191
- All right, walk.
-They have given the needle

38:01.235 --> 38:04.194
to at least one of us every
month since I've been here.

38:04.717 --> 38:06.066
God bless you, brother.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.328
Hang in there, bro.

38:08.634 --> 38:09.896
We'll be praying for you.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.334
Be strong.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.036
I'd like to believe

38:21.386 --> 38:22.212
that even in a terrible place
like this

38:22.256 --> 38:23.170
there may be some good.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.521
But all I see is cruelty
and suffering.

38:26.869 --> 38:28.915
Everybody pretty much hates it
the same.

38:30.395 --> 38:33.615
...And we will be raised
in pairs.

38:33.876 --> 38:36.314
And death will be swallowed
in victory.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.186
- Come here.
- Where's your victory?

38:39.404 --> 38:42.494
Death, where is--
will you let me fucking walk?

38:42.755 --> 38:44.800
-Will you let me fucking walk?
-Chill the fuck out.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.149
Let me walk
like a fucking man.

38:47.455 --> 38:48.717
Stand tall, bro.

38:48.761 --> 38:51.416
Oh, God! Oh, God!

38:51.459 --> 38:53.592
Let me fucking walk,
you bastard!

38:54.201 --> 38:58.074
Hey, baby killer! Baby killer!

39:00.468 --> 39:01.687
Hey, white boy.

39:04.298 --> 39:05.821
Yo, asshole!

39:05.865 --> 39:07.736
What's your problem, man?
I'm talking to you.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.390
You think I'm stupid
or something, boy?

39:09.434 --> 39:10.391
Boy?

39:11.566 --> 39:13.089
-Come again?
-If I say anything to you,

39:13.133 --> 39:14.961
you're gonna start saying
I confess some shit,

39:15.004 --> 39:16.963
get a reduced sentence,
fuck that!

39:17.006 --> 39:18.660
Hey, listen good, sugar.

39:20.053 --> 39:24.144
They get you here,
they got you good.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.365
Confession make you feel better?

39:27.974 --> 39:29.062
Huh, sweet thing?

39:30.455 --> 39:31.456
All right.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.285
I knocked over a jewelry store.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.288
Kind of hit a leak.

39:38.811 --> 39:41.161
Oh, God. He reached under
the counter for a piece

39:41.204 --> 39:43.772
and I shot him in the head.

39:46.906 --> 39:47.994
I was high.

39:49.735 --> 39:53.216
And I am guilty, but murder one,

39:53.869 --> 39:56.568
shit, that is manslaughter
at the most.

39:57.264 --> 39:58.526
But this is Texas.

40:00.136 --> 40:03.052
You know why they call
it capital punishment? Huh?

40:03.705 --> 40:06.273
Hey, you ain't got no capital,
you get punished.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.057
-That's right.
- Shit.

40:08.536 --> 40:10.320
Now, don't tell me
that ain't your story too,

40:10.364 --> 40:13.323
because I know that sorry ass,
state-appointed lawyer of yours.

40:13.367 --> 40:14.281
Huh?

40:15.674 --> 40:16.849
Plumbers
ain't no different from lawyers.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.328
There's good ones
and there's bad ones.

40:18.372 --> 40:21.680
But you know what, poor folks
always get the bad ones.

40:22.376 --> 40:23.856
Just like my granddaddy
always said,

40:23.899 --> 40:26.554
everybody gets the same
amount of ice,

40:26.598 --> 40:28.774
except rich folks get it
in the summer.

40:29.078 --> 40:32.342
Of course, you could try to
become a cause célèbre

40:32.386 --> 40:33.343
or some such shit.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.911
Might even be worth some
publicity.

40:35.955 --> 40:38.566
You can get you one of them
fancy pants, white shoe boys

40:38.610 --> 40:39.828
willing to do it for free.

40:39.872 --> 40:40.742
By the end,

40:42.265 --> 40:43.092
who knows if you got enough time
left to make a difference.

40:43.136 --> 40:44.790
-Hold up.
- What?

40:44.833 --> 40:47.314
You saying I can get me
a new lawyer with no money?

40:47.357 --> 40:50.317
Yeah, boy.
Now, you just write up a letter

40:50.360 --> 40:54.321
about your situation and send it
to the Texas Equal Justice

40:54.364 --> 40:56.802
and that should do it.
That's initiative.

40:56.845 --> 41:01.110
I-N-I-T-I-A-T-I-V to the E.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.461
T-I-V to the E.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.334
So, you say your previous
counsel,

41:07.377 --> 41:10.250
failed to capitalize
on numerous opportunities

41:10.293 --> 41:12.208
to reach the prosecutions'
witnesses?

41:12.861 --> 41:15.385
Or to present any viable
alternative

41:15.908 --> 41:17.997
to their theories of your
culpability?

41:20.608 --> 41:21.914
He did a shit sorry job.

41:22.654 --> 41:23.698
Sold you down the river.

41:25.744 --> 41:27.354
This is your trial transcript.

41:27.833 --> 41:31.619
And just a few books,
might be helpful.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.403
Homework.

41:34.666 --> 41:36.363
I'm preparing
a writ of habeas corpus,

41:36.406 --> 41:38.060
also known as "The great writ."

41:38.931 --> 41:40.585
We're allowed to present
new evidence,

41:40.628 --> 41:42.369
if we can find some, that is.

41:43.022 --> 41:46.939
Do you have any, you know,
resources to help us?

41:47.374 --> 41:49.637
Someone who'll pay
for a private investigator?

41:49.681 --> 41:52.118
Your wife or family?

41:52.161 --> 41:53.989
-No, sir.
-All right.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.252
Well, we'll figure something
out.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.560
We need to find something
in your trial

41:59.604 --> 42:00.953
that demonstrates negligence.

42:01.431 --> 42:03.303
That's harder to do
once you've been convicted.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.523
I need you to go through
the transcript

42:06.001 --> 42:07.525
and find anything questionable.

42:07.786 --> 42:09.091
Okay, can you do that?

42:10.571 --> 42:12.921
I think I'll squeeze it
into my very hectic schedule.

42:14.706 --> 42:17.535
This writ could be your last
chance.

42:18.231 --> 42:19.580
And a slim one at that.

42:26.631 --> 42:30.548
Hey, Metallica. I can
practically hear you reading.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.812
Give that a rest,
let me beat you at Crazy Eights.

42:33.855 --> 42:35.465
This is making my head hurt.

42:35.509 --> 42:36.858
They make it that way
on purpose.

42:36.902 --> 42:38.251
Keep out dummies
like us.

42:38.294 --> 42:40.079
There's some crazy ass words
in here, bro.

42:40.601 --> 42:43.909
-Contemptuous, colloquially.
- Spell that shit

42:43.952 --> 42:45.519
-without looking.
-Analogous.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.695
-Did I even say it right?

42:48.087 --> 42:49.784
-Meticulous.
-Uh-huh.

42:49.828 --> 42:50.916
Interwoven.

42:52.178 --> 42:53.005
Now, I'm gonna drop
some knowledge for you.

42:54.223 --> 42:56.704
That first appeal,
it might not go nowhere.

42:57.096 --> 42:58.184
They ain't gonna overturn

42:58.227 --> 42:59.620
their hunting buddy's
conviction.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.840
You might have a chance
with the Fifth Circuit.

43:01.883 --> 43:03.624
What about this Supreme Court
shit?

43:03.668 --> 43:05.887
You kidding? If it leans
any more to the right

43:05.931 --> 43:06.932
it'll tip over.

43:08.107 --> 43:09.108
These books
keep talking about justice

43:09.151 --> 43:10.239
like it's something real.

43:11.719 --> 43:12.198
Man, there ain't
no justice in the system.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.027
And there ain't none in this
life, either.

43:17.159 --> 43:19.118
You know, why was I born black?

43:20.206 --> 43:21.076
Hmm?

43:21.729 --> 43:23.078
Yeah, black as hell.

43:23.644 --> 43:25.777
And why was y'all born poor
and stupid?

43:26.038 --> 43:27.648
Can't I be born poor and smart?

43:27.692 --> 43:29.607
No, man,
it's a lie, bro.

43:30.695 --> 43:32.522
What if somebody
really is innocent?

43:32.566 --> 43:34.002
It ain't got nothing to do
with it.

43:35.830 --> 43:37.963
Death penalty's good politics.

43:39.181 --> 43:40.922
As a matter of fact,
in an election year,

43:40.966 --> 43:42.794
they always kill
twice as many of us.

43:43.359 --> 43:44.839
That's politics for your ass.

43:44.883 --> 43:46.449
-For real?
-Yeah.

43:46.493 --> 43:49.888
Your candy ass politicians feel
like real men killing folks.

43:49.931 --> 43:51.280
Take your hand, bro.

44:00.376 --> 44:02.901
-Right on, brother.

44:07.514 --> 44:08.689
Stay strong!

44:08.733 --> 44:10.082
Second and five,

44:10.125 --> 44:12.040
ball on the 38th.
Hand off to Smith...

44:12.084 --> 44:14.260
-Go!
-Come on, baby. Come on.

44:14.303 --> 44:15.696
-Go!
-Yeah, do it!

44:15.740 --> 44:18.003
-Run! Run, boy!
-Go right there.

44:18.046 --> 44:20.266
-Run, boy!
-That's gone, right there!

44:20.309 --> 44:21.310
Yeah!

44:23.617 --> 44:26.402
Dallas Cowboys,
touchdown!

44:26.446 --> 44:28.927
And the Cowboys take the lead
for the first time.

44:28.970 --> 44:31.103
Woo! Heck yeah!

44:31.146 --> 44:32.800
They don't know about
that Southern ground, baby.

44:32.844 --> 44:35.847
-Come on, let's go!
-I got you.

44:35.890 --> 44:37.022
How about them boys?

44:43.202 --> 44:45.770
Hey.
Thanks for covering my shift.

44:46.074 --> 44:47.815
-Yeah, you owe me, bitch.
-Oh, man.

44:47.859 --> 44:50.122
You would've skinned my ass
alive on this Becky party.

44:50.165 --> 44:52.733
We had a clown, a cake,
the whole nine fucking yards.

44:52.777 --> 44:54.735
I was serving ice cream
to little princesses.

44:54.779 --> 44:57.303
-It was pretty good.
-Get out of there, Willingham.

44:57.346 --> 44:59.218
-Yeah, boss.
-Hurry up.

44:59.261 --> 45:00.480
Hurrying up, boss.

45:01.350 --> 45:02.830
I'm in a real hurry.

45:04.179 --> 45:05.920
Real hurry to go do nothing.

45:07.617 --> 45:09.576
You fucking listening to me,
baby burner?

45:10.490 --> 45:12.405
-What? No--
-Huh?

45:13.232 --> 45:14.799
Yes, boss, I was.

45:14.842 --> 45:17.323
-You fucking pervert.
-Take it easy, he's on my watch.

45:17.366 --> 45:19.978
I don't give a shit. I don't
want his sicko ears on my kids.

45:20.021 --> 45:22.937
Look at me, why you so fucking
interested in my life, huh?

45:24.417 --> 45:25.723
Come on, man.
Let's go.

45:32.207 --> 45:34.427
Sunday was
my daughter's birthday, too.

45:42.478 --> 45:44.089
I woulda killed
the motherfucker.

45:45.133 --> 45:47.396
What are they gonna do,
put you on death row?

45:47.440 --> 45:49.181
He's just a screw, Ponch.

45:50.138 --> 45:51.966
Probably got picked on
at school.

45:54.055 --> 45:55.491
Says he's got a daughter.

45:59.278 --> 46:00.279
Ponch.

46:02.150 --> 46:03.151
Ponchai.

46:08.287 --> 46:09.462
What's up, Ponch?

46:13.422 --> 46:14.467
I...

46:17.035 --> 46:18.384
I got my date today.

46:19.080 --> 46:21.430
They're moving me
to the observation cell.

46:22.910 --> 46:24.782
Scared I'm gonna kill myself.

46:25.739 --> 46:26.958
Shit, Ponch.

46:29.830 --> 46:31.049
It is what it is.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.706
Shit, I'm thinking...

46:37.403 --> 46:38.317
uh...

46:39.927 --> 46:41.799
two orders of onion rings to go
with my chicken fried steak.

46:43.452 --> 46:45.367
Smothered in Texas pea.

46:46.325 --> 46:48.631
One of them, you know,
strawberry milkshakes.

46:48.675 --> 46:51.634
Shit. I'm gon' throw up all over
the damn place.

47:13.091 --> 47:15.441
Lord, give me the courage
to take my...

47:22.491 --> 47:26.713
No, no, no, let go off me.
Get off me, get off me!

47:26.756 --> 47:28.062
Come on!

47:28.106 --> 47:30.848
It's not my time yet, man!
It's not my time!

47:31.109 --> 47:33.763
No! No!

47:33.807 --> 47:34.895
Not yet!

47:34.939 --> 47:36.592
Let's go, brother.
Let's go, brother.

47:36.636 --> 47:39.073
-I can't do it. No, man.
-Yes, you can, Ponch. You can.

47:39.117 --> 47:40.596
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can, brother.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.684
Stand tall now, brother.

47:41.728 --> 47:43.251
-No!
-Let's go, Ponch.

47:43.295 --> 47:45.471
They don't get this work.
That's two for you, baby.

47:45.514 --> 47:47.342
- Hey, it's Ponchai!
- Ponchai James.

47:47.386 --> 47:49.736
- It's all you, brother!
-Ponchai Ja...

47:49.779 --> 47:51.390
Ponchai James!

47:51.433 --> 47:52.478
He's the man!

47:52.521 --> 47:53.740
Let's go, Ponch.

47:53.783 --> 47:55.176
-Let's go, brother.
- Ponchai James.

47:55.220 --> 47:56.351
-All right.
- Go, baby.

47:56.395 --> 47:58.571
Ponchai James.

47:58.614 --> 48:00.660
Oh, they gonna remember you,
Ponch.

48:00.703 --> 48:02.009
Ponch!

48:59.632 --> 49:00.633
Hey.

49:01.895 --> 49:03.114
You need some help?

49:05.551 --> 49:06.987
So, are you from around here?

49:11.078 --> 49:12.558
Why'd you stop back there?

49:14.560 --> 49:16.518
Oh, I didn't think you were
dangerous.

49:17.128 --> 49:19.260
Figured I could take you
one on one.

49:22.002 --> 49:23.221
You weren't scared?

49:23.830 --> 49:26.137
-What?
-You weren't scared?

49:27.007 --> 49:28.791
Of you? Why?

49:29.140 --> 49:30.141
Why not?

49:32.665 --> 49:34.536
I guess I just didn't think
about it.

49:35.668 --> 49:37.104
Thank you so much.

49:37.148 --> 49:38.584
Oh, thank you.

49:38.627 --> 49:40.107
Can't you stay a moment more?

49:41.021 --> 49:43.545
You might be just the kind
of person we're looking for.

49:44.503 --> 49:47.549
Oh, you're scared now?

49:48.942 --> 49:52.859
Well, I'm a little weirded out,
to tell you the truth.

49:53.773 --> 49:55.775
-What you want from me?
-Your address.

49:56.471 --> 49:58.821
-What for?
-I wanna send you something.

49:58.865 --> 50:00.562
Oh, you don't need to
send me anything.

50:00.606 --> 50:02.347
Well, I wanna return the favor.

50:02.825 --> 50:05.002
I think you and I were intended
to meet.

50:06.264 --> 50:09.049
So, was she, like,
a crazy person or--

50:09.093 --> 50:10.964
Why did she want
your address?

50:11.312 --> 50:15.447
Well, she said somebody might
wanna write me a letter.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.362
-Who?
-A prisoner.

50:18.798 --> 50:20.495
-What?
-Nothing.

50:20.539 --> 50:23.063
- What?
-Just classic Liz.

50:23.107 --> 50:25.805
-Oh, here we go.
-The abandoned kittens,

50:26.066 --> 50:28.155
the homeless family
at the truck stop.

50:28.199 --> 50:29.504
Oh, my God.

50:29.548 --> 50:31.419
The starving African kids
on TV.

50:31.463 --> 50:34.422
-Okay. Gullible, bleeding heart.
-Oh, I'm not saying that.

50:34.466 --> 50:35.858
You called me St. Liz
for a decade.

50:35.902 --> 50:37.730
Well, that's not what I think.

50:39.123 --> 50:41.603
We're well past lying, George,
aren't we?

50:43.605 --> 50:46.565
So, yesterday, I got a letter.

50:46.608 --> 50:49.307
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, girl, how was school?

50:50.569 --> 50:51.918
Earth to Julie.

50:52.788 --> 50:55.052
-Sorry?
-Never mind.

50:55.095 --> 50:56.618
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

50:58.359 --> 51:04.061
And it said, "Dear Ms. Gilbert,
I got your address from TCADP.

51:04.104 --> 51:07.803
I was told that you might be
willing to correspond

51:08.369 --> 51:10.458
with someone such as myself."

51:10.502 --> 51:12.808
What is that, the TAD,
whatever?

51:12.852 --> 51:13.983
TCADP.

51:15.289 --> 51:17.030
Texas Coalition
to Abolish the Death Penalty.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.292
How'd you get involved in that?

51:18.336 --> 51:20.729
The lady who asked
for my address.

51:21.382 --> 51:23.689
-You don't listen to me.
-No, I was listening.

51:23.732 --> 51:25.430
-What did he do?
-Never mind.

51:25.473 --> 51:27.649
Oh, come on, Liz
Come on.

51:27.693 --> 51:29.086
Why is he on death row?

51:29.477 --> 51:30.609
He...

51:32.045 --> 51:34.265
He burned down his house
with his kids inside.

51:34.308 --> 51:36.136
-That's charming.

51:36.702 --> 51:39.270
-All right. Here.

51:45.145 --> 51:47.669
So, why exactly
are you doing this?

51:47.713 --> 51:49.280
I didn't say I was doing it.

51:49.323 --> 51:50.803
But you're thinking about it.

51:51.195 --> 51:55.286
Well, can't I just not know?
I don't know.

51:55.329 --> 51:58.593
Isn't looking after one person
with a death sentence enough?

52:02.293 --> 52:04.251
-I'm sorry.

52:06.123 --> 52:10.605
So, are you and the kids okay?
Money and everything.

52:11.606 --> 52:13.086
-Yeah.
-Well, if you need anything,

52:13.130 --> 52:15.393
-just...
-Your check comes on time.

52:16.916 --> 52:18.570
And we talked all that out.

52:20.789 --> 52:22.748
-I failed you, Liz.

52:23.836 --> 52:25.359
And yet, you're here for me.

52:26.578 --> 52:28.449
If thing's were the other way
around,

52:29.102 --> 52:30.625
would I be there for you?

52:32.845 --> 52:34.803
Do we get off that sow
or just admit the truth?

52:38.851 --> 52:39.895
How are you...

52:41.332 --> 52:42.246
really?

52:49.557 --> 52:51.559
-Mama, you forgot the milk.

52:51.603 --> 52:53.692
-I'm going to the market later.
-Okay.

52:53.735 --> 52:55.998
-Mom, what are reading there?
-Letter from a guy in jail

52:56.042 --> 52:57.174
-who kills babies.
-Julie.

52:58.653 --> 52:59.915
What, are you writing
a play about him or something?

52:59.959 --> 53:02.527
No, sweetie, there's a man
who is in prison--

53:02.570 --> 53:04.616
-He wants Mama to visit him.
-Seriously?

53:05.269 --> 53:07.793
A lot of people visit inmates,
and I'm not saying that I'm--

53:07.836 --> 53:09.925
You know they're gonna poison
him to death, right?

53:09.969 --> 53:12.058
-He deserves it.
-You got somewhere to be,

53:12.101 --> 53:13.886
like, school, and maybe
clean your mess up?

53:13.929 --> 53:15.322
Mama, I know
what the death penalty is--

53:15.366 --> 53:16.976
I can't believe you're actually
thinking about

53:17.019 --> 53:18.020
visiting a murderer.

53:18.064 --> 53:19.152
-I didn't say--
-That is so gross.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.153
I didn't say he was innocent.

53:21.589 --> 53:22.634
-Okay, then what are you saying?
-He's a human being.

53:23.852 --> 53:25.463
Okay, I'm late.
Dave's gonna drop me.

53:25.506 --> 53:27.029
So, are you seeing your dad,
later?

53:27.378 --> 53:28.553
No, the Gremlins will be there.

53:28.596 --> 53:30.772
Well, they are your
brother and sister.

53:32.296 --> 53:33.253
What?

53:33.775 --> 53:34.994
Fine. I'll go.

53:35.429 --> 53:36.822
All right.
Am I getting you later?

53:36.865 --> 53:38.258
No,
Dave's gonna drive me.

53:38.302 --> 53:39.868
Well, will you call me,
please, miss?

53:39.912 --> 53:41.174
Mom, I got soccer practice
till 6:00

53:41.218 --> 53:42.784
-and I'm taking the bus.
-Okay, well I thought

53:42.828 --> 53:44.003
-I was getting you.
- Bye.

53:44.046 --> 53:45.222
What about oatmeal?

53:48.921 --> 53:51.489
Death row inmates
aren't allowed to associate

53:51.532 --> 53:53.142
with the general population.

53:54.056 --> 53:56.798
We have no contact at all
with the outside.

53:56.842 --> 53:59.236
No one in the whole world knows
I exist.

53:59.801 --> 54:02.239
I feel like I'm slowly being
erased.

54:04.284 --> 54:05.677
Please excuse my writing,

54:06.678 --> 54:08.723
I'm learning to express myself
better.

54:09.898 --> 54:11.900
I've added your name
to my visitor's list

54:11.944 --> 54:13.467
in case you
decide to come.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.992
Meantime, I hope your
life turns forever forward.

54:17.602 --> 54:19.647
Yours, Cameron Todd Willingham.

54:40.233 --> 54:42.975
Hello, sir, I'm here to see
Cameron Todd Willingham.

54:49.895 --> 54:50.983
Come, miss.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.226
Thank you for coming,
Mrs. Gilbert.

55:17.879 --> 55:19.098
It's really nice to meet you.

55:19.141 --> 55:21.013
Oh, nice to meet you too,
Cameron.

55:21.405 --> 55:22.754
Folks call me Todd.

55:23.494 --> 55:25.365
Oh, yeah? Todd.

55:25.713 --> 55:28.063
I really appreciate you
coming all this way.

55:29.935 --> 55:31.893
-You're in Houston, right?
-Yeah.

55:32.720 --> 55:35.157
-How was the drive?
-Oh, it was fine.

55:35.201 --> 55:39.510
Well, some traffic, you know,
Houston Freeway has become...

55:41.599 --> 55:42.730
crazy.

55:44.732 --> 55:48.170
You know, you're my first
visitor in a long time.

55:48.780 --> 55:49.781
Am I?

55:51.130 --> 55:52.218
Well, good.

55:53.132 --> 55:55.917
I guess. And why is that?

55:58.137 --> 56:02.489
-I...
-I mean, your wife comes?

56:03.272 --> 56:05.187
No, Stacy and me
ain't together no more.

56:05.231 --> 56:06.232
Oh...

56:07.015 --> 56:09.148
I guess I understand,
it's just...

56:11.890 --> 56:13.370
I miss her, is all.

56:15.023 --> 56:16.111
Sorry.

56:17.635 --> 56:19.114
How about your folks?

56:20.028 --> 56:21.465
They're in Oklahoma, ma'am.

56:22.727 --> 56:24.206
It's 200 miles each way.

56:26.426 --> 56:27.775
And my folks is old.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.821
And my mom's ailing, so...

56:31.997 --> 56:33.259
They come when they can.

56:35.479 --> 56:38.177
Well, how about you tell me
about...

56:39.483 --> 56:42.311
your life here,
what it's like or...

56:42.355 --> 56:45.358
-Not much to tell, really.
-Mm, right.

56:47.142 --> 56:49.797
Any comforts or, I don't know?

56:50.537 --> 56:51.582
In jail?

56:52.670 --> 56:53.758
No, ma'am.

56:56.848 --> 57:00.417
I'm sorry, Todd.
I don't know-- I don't know...

57:01.113 --> 57:03.376
what to ask or how to...

57:04.986 --> 57:10.078
If I-- If I--
If I make it harder to talk.

57:10.122 --> 57:15.127
No, ma'am. How about you?
Tell me about the outside world.

57:16.563 --> 57:18.609
Maybe I can get out
of this place for a while.

57:19.261 --> 57:22.482
Oh, all right, sure.

57:22.526 --> 57:25.790
But maybe you call me Elizabeth,
because when you say ma'am,

57:25.833 --> 57:28.096
it makes me feel like
you're talking to my mama.

57:31.012 --> 57:32.536
-Elizabeth.
-Okay.

57:33.014 --> 57:36.583
Well, um... let's see.

57:37.628 --> 57:40.761
-You married?
-Me? Divorced, actually.

57:41.240 --> 57:42.676
-Kids?
-Two.

57:43.851 --> 57:45.331
Andrew and Julie.

57:45.810 --> 57:47.507
-Boy and a girl.
-Yeah.

57:47.551 --> 57:49.988
-That's nice.
-Yeah, yeah.

57:52.469 --> 57:55.384
My big girl, Amber,
she'd be 11 by now.

57:58.562 --> 58:00.868
And Karmen and Kameron,
they'd be nine.

58:01.565 --> 58:02.783
They was twins.

58:04.306 --> 58:06.395
Twins? Oof!

58:06.831 --> 58:09.181
-That's something, huh?
-Yes, ma'am.

58:09.224 --> 58:10.225
Elizabeth.

58:11.444 --> 58:14.012
Oh, you ever tried
diapering two at once?

58:14.055 --> 58:15.230
-No.
-Oo-ee.

58:15.883 --> 58:17.929
Stacy used to say it was like
trying to

58:17.972 --> 58:19.931
grab a hold of two little
greased piggies

58:19.974 --> 58:21.454
at the state fair.

58:31.072 --> 58:33.771
Oh, they was the most beautiful
babies in the whole world.

58:39.516 --> 58:42.954
They're all different,
but cut from the same cloth.

58:44.956 --> 58:46.958
Now, Kameron, she was smart.

58:47.001 --> 58:49.526
She had, like,
a routine that she stuck to.

58:50.439 --> 58:52.877
And if anybody disturbed it,
and she didn't like it,

58:52.920 --> 58:54.879
she would let the whole of Texas
know about it.

58:54.922 --> 58:57.403
Karmen, she was--
She was more like me.

58:57.969 --> 59:00.319
And Amber, she was a great
big sister.

59:00.362 --> 59:03.714
She went from redecorating
her sister's room to...

59:04.932 --> 59:07.456
turning around to me one time,
and saying, "Daddy,

59:07.718 --> 59:11.112
I love the new babies, but when
are they going home now?"

59:22.907 --> 59:25.039
Gosh, I tell you
I wanna hear about the world

59:25.083 --> 59:26.737
and I end up doing
all the talking.

59:27.128 --> 59:28.477
Oh, that's fine.

59:29.870 --> 59:32.307
Well, I'm sorry.
I guess, it's just been a while.

59:33.352 --> 59:34.832
How long has it been?

59:35.528 --> 59:38.749
-Eight years.
-Hey.

59:41.316 --> 59:43.362
We're pretty much
at the end of the line now.

59:46.234 --> 59:47.540
You scared, Todd?

59:48.280 --> 59:50.717
I did not kill my own children,
Elizabeth.

59:52.414 --> 59:53.459
I swear.

59:54.765 --> 59:57.115
I love them more
than I love life itself.

59:57.594 --> 59:59.465
- Time's up.

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:23.750
It was weird.
He was gentle and soft spoken.

01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:25.970
Oh, that's because he wants to
get in your pants.

01:00:26.013 --> 01:00:27.754
-You know that's true.
-That's rude.

01:00:27.798 --> 01:00:30.539
And he was a devil worshiper
to boot!

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:31.671
No!

01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:34.369
-No.
-No, I heard it right on the TV.

01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:38.765
He burned up those babies
as a sacrifice to Satan himself.

01:00:39.113 --> 01:00:41.202
Seriously? Girls,
you're getting out of control.

01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:43.291
If anybody were to come near
my babies,

01:00:43.335 --> 01:00:46.033
I got a .38 Colt by my bedside
with their name on it.

01:00:46.077 --> 01:00:48.340
The idea of you
with your loaded .38

01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:50.255
makes me wanna move out
of the neighborhood.

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:53.301
Let's get started.

01:00:54.912 --> 01:00:56.435
Are you gonna use some of this
for your new play, as if...

01:00:56.478 --> 01:00:58.698
-Oh, I don't know.
-Fascinating.

01:00:58.742 --> 01:01:02.528
Liz, wha-- What if somebody
was trying to hurt your babies?

01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:03.747
I'd do anything.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.400
-See?
-That's not the point.

01:01:05.444 --> 01:01:07.968
-Of course, it is.
-It's still taking a life.

01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:09.970
A monster
who don't deserve to live.

01:01:10.231 --> 01:01:11.842
It's just revenge.

01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:15.236
I mean, are we still there?
Isn't that a primitive idea?

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:18.457
No. It's called restitution.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.067
Let the punishment
fit the crime.

01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:22.679
Okay, well, you better kill
your ex-husband.

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:24.332
Oh, wouldn't that be great?

01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:29.642
Liz, don't become one of those
sad women we hear about,

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.689
-who falls in love with--
-Me?

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:33.777
I'm just saying.

01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:37.824
Thank you so much for
your interest in my love life.

01:01:38.085 --> 01:01:40.435
But don't worry,
even someone as desperate as me

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:42.916
knows that a death row romance
doesn't have a future.

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:48.748
Hey.

01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:03.197
Dad died.

01:02:22.434 --> 01:02:23.652
Dear Elizabeth,

01:02:25.176 --> 01:02:26.525
I didn't get a chance to
express my deep gratitude

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:27.569
for your visit.

01:02:28.266 --> 01:02:30.398
It lifted my spirits for days.

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:36.709
Sir?

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:51.550
I used to be full of hate.

01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:54.292
Hate for the judge,
hate for the jury.

01:02:54.596 --> 01:02:56.076
Hate for everyone
who mistreated

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.556
me and wanted me dead.

01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.298
I guess after all this time,

01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:02.604
the hate just kinda
burned out of me.

01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:06.478
I've been working hard
on my case and...

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.132
it's funny,

01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:10.438
I'm no longer the same dumb
24-year-old

01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:12.223
who lost his place
in the world...

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.880
and have achieved more learning
within these walls

01:03:16.923 --> 01:03:18.403
than I ever did in school.

01:03:22.015 --> 01:03:24.452
I can remember every word
of our conversation.

01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:27.804
You're the kind of person
I never had the chance to meet.

01:03:28.282 --> 01:03:29.327
An artist,

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.026
filled with intellectual ideas,
and worldly wisdom.

01:03:34.027 --> 01:03:37.378
"For me, it was more than
a connection to a world.

01:03:37.422 --> 01:03:38.989
It brought my heart to laugh,

01:03:39.032 --> 01:03:42.427
and created an omni-potent glow
around my being."

01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:45.169
Sounds like he's prepping
for the SATs.

01:03:45.212 --> 01:03:47.606
Mm-hmm. Well, first of all,
it's omnipotent.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:51.131
And secondly, maybe he's just
trying to improve himself.

01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:55.048
I mean, there's other people we
know who might wanna, like,

01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:58.095
-study for the SATs.
-I'm studying!

01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:03.796
You wanna visit him again?

01:04:04.797 --> 01:04:07.234
Is this like a... a thing?

01:04:08.757 --> 01:04:09.758
I might.

01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:11.456
Why?

01:04:13.806 --> 01:04:15.068
I don't know, honey.

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:21.858
You know, when you just wanna
do something...

01:04:25.644 --> 01:04:26.645
help...

01:04:28.212 --> 01:04:29.996
somebody who's feeling...

01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:33.347
so much, you know?

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:39.005
I don't know what I'm saying.
Am I making any sense?

01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:40.050
Honestly...

01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:42.400
not really.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.993
I cannot believe you came back.

01:05:10.036 --> 01:05:11.081
I sure did.

01:05:12.082 --> 01:05:13.257
Look at you.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.041
So pretty.

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:17.000
You don't have to say that,
Todd.

01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:18.175
Are you kidding me?

01:05:19.828 --> 01:05:21.352
Look at your hair, your eyes,
your dress, everything's just...

01:05:21.395 --> 01:05:23.702
mm-mm, singin' to me.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:25.051
Okay.

01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:28.576
Stand up for me.
Just give me a twirl.

01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:30.927
-What?
-Come on, now. Just once.

01:05:32.189 --> 01:05:33.277
Now, come on.

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:34.626
No.

01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:38.238
How you been?

01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:41.894
Liz, last time you came,

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.678
I was the one
who did all the talking.

01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:46.116
How are the kids?
Julie and Andrew, right?

01:05:46.159 --> 01:05:47.160
Yeah.

01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.162
They're okay.

01:05:49.858 --> 01:05:51.469
Hmm. I told you their ages?

01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:52.557
No.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.689
-Um, Julie is 17.
-Uh-oh.

01:05:54.733 --> 01:05:55.734
Super smart.

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:58.258
She's a great kid, but...

01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:00.782
she's a pain in my butt
sometimes.

01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:03.263
-Oh, my Lord.

01:06:03.655 --> 01:06:06.049
Well, you wouldn't wanna know me
when I was 17.

01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:08.660
-Believe me. Uh-uh.
-Oh, no kidding?

01:06:10.183 --> 01:06:12.838
-And Andrew?
-Best freckles known to man.

01:06:12.881 --> 01:06:14.927
-Is he breaking hearts?
-On the cusp.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.146
They get to see their daddy
much?

01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:20.628
What's wrong?

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:23.675
Their dad died
a couple of weeks ago.

01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:25.503
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:06:26.808 --> 01:06:28.810
I'm sorry to hear
about your loss.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.076
I guess, we both know what it is
to lose something now.

01:06:38.472 --> 01:06:40.953
I wrote a poem about my babies.
It's pretty bad.

01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:42.476
You wanna hear it?

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.651
Sure, of course.

01:06:47.394 --> 01:06:48.395
It's bad.

01:06:50.832 --> 01:06:53.705
"I know their beauty flows
deep within.

01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:57.404
And all that's broken
their love will mend.

01:06:58.188 --> 01:07:00.668
This beauty of theirs
is so unique.

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:04.324
It's much more valuable
than priceless antiques."

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:06.631
Nice.

01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:10.896
-Fucking terrible, huh?

01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:14.117
It's terrible.

01:07:16.858 --> 01:07:19.383
All sections,
call count, five minutes,

01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:20.949
clear your ranks,
clear the cages.

01:07:25.606 --> 01:07:27.260
You're a Cowboys fan, right?

01:07:28.087 --> 01:07:29.045
Yeah.

01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:32.265
You think Aikman and Irving
have still got it?

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.920
You almost done?
It's fucking freezing out here.

01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:37.444
Figured out why
you're always pissed.

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:39.272
Yeah, why's that?

01:07:39.316 --> 01:07:41.666
Because you're a prisoner here,
too, like me.

01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:43.320
You ain't bottom of the pile.

01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:45.713
You ain't top of the pile,
neither.

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:47.672
You're just kinda
middle of the pile.

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:50.501
-Now, in order to feel like

01:07:50.544 --> 01:07:51.893
you're going somewhere
in the world,

01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:53.939
you got to stand on
the likes of me.

01:07:55.897 --> 01:07:57.203
But don't really get you
anywhere,

01:07:57.247 --> 01:07:58.683
you just kinda stay
in the middle.

01:07:58.726 --> 01:07:59.814
Yeah?

01:07:59.858 --> 01:08:01.338
You my fucking therapist now?

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.299
I just got a lot of time
on my hands is all.

01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:12.871
You ever read
Man's Search for Meaning?

01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:15.874
I was absent that day.

01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:17.876
It's by Viktor E. Frankl.

01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:22.446
-Okay.
-Yeah, the guy basically says...

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:25.536
"To live is to suffer.

01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:30.193
And to survive, you got to find
meaning in the suffering."

01:08:33.544 --> 01:08:35.198
I made a promise to my daughter.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:38.636
She visits me sometimes.

01:08:41.987 --> 01:08:43.466
You got a daughter too, right?

01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:47.862
What's her name again?

01:08:49.037 --> 01:08:50.037
Becky.

01:08:51.038 --> 01:08:52.127
Let's go inside.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:58.698
No need to cuff your bitch ass.

01:08:58.743 --> 01:09:00.484
Are you sure?
I'm feeling dangerous, brother.

01:09:00.527 --> 01:09:02.529
-Yeah, you ain't got shit.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.270
How you been?

01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:08.926
Yeah?

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:12.712
Been doing much?

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:18.328
This is you.

01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:22.854
Don't really look like you,
though, huh?

01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:27.118
I might have to give her
a haircut.

01:09:28.337 --> 01:09:29.729
Are you seeing your sisters?

01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:31.689
They good?

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.734
Are you mad at me?

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.522
Are you mad at me?

01:09:43.527 --> 01:09:44.658
You still see them?

01:09:45.832 --> 01:09:47.487
Yeah, you taking care of them?

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:49.314
Yeah?

01:09:51.099 --> 01:09:52.752
You gonna tell them
you saw Daddy?

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:55.756
You gonna tell them I'm sorry?

01:10:02.981 --> 01:10:04.983
You know I didn't do it,
don't you?

01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:16.081
Well, Todd,

01:10:16.124 --> 01:10:18.431
you want to hear
about my life, so here goes.

01:10:19.127 --> 01:10:20.868
You probably didn't want this
much detail,

01:10:20.912 --> 01:10:23.306
but you did say
you wanted to know everything.

01:10:25.873 --> 01:10:27.005
Mornings are tough.

01:10:27.701 --> 01:10:28.702
Morning.

01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:30.878
Teenagers think
they can stay up all night.

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:32.619
Then they seemed

01:10:32.663 --> 01:10:34.012
surprised when they have
to wake up for school.

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:38.843
I probably coddle
them too much,

01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:41.149
but that's my
right as a mother.

01:10:42.847 --> 01:10:44.240
Well, it's just me now.

01:10:44.675 --> 01:10:46.764
I guess I want them to know
I'm there for them.

01:10:48.722 --> 01:10:52.422
Hey, hey, didn't you need me
to sign

01:10:52.465 --> 01:10:54.511
that signature page
for you?

01:10:54.772 --> 01:10:55.903
But I tell you...

01:10:56.469 --> 01:10:58.558
sometimes that hour between

01:10:58.602 --> 01:11:00.647
6:00 and 7:00 in the morning

01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:02.649
feels about five minutes long.

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:05.304
-Lunch. Is that enough, though?
-Yeah.

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:07.306
-Give me a hug.
-Bye, Mama. Love you.

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.394
Love you.

01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:10.004
-Love you.
-Bye, now. Eat today.

01:11:10.048 --> 01:11:13.443
Most days I try to write.
Recently, not so much.

01:11:20.058 --> 01:11:21.929
As good as my life is...

01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:24.323
I can't help think
of all the plans I had

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:25.716
that never happened.

01:11:27.892 --> 01:11:30.895
I know that sounds spoiled
to someone in your situation.

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.854
But you said
you want the truth.

01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:37.684
Dear Elizabeth,
I cannot thank you enough

01:11:37.728 --> 01:11:40.296
for sharing your thoughts
and feelings with me.

01:11:40.818 --> 01:11:42.602
I never really looked deeply
into myself

01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:43.995
before we started writing...

01:11:44.038 --> 01:11:45.301
Dear Todd,
I got your drawing.

01:11:46.127 --> 01:11:47.651
That is so beautiful.

01:11:47.694 --> 01:11:49.217
You say you wanna know
what my life is like.

01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:53.134
Well, try staying in your
kitchen for an entire day.

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:55.833
Then think about
what it'd be like

01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:57.574
to be there
for the rest of your life.

01:11:59.924 --> 01:12:01.969
Regular prisoners talk
about doing time,

01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:04.320
but on the row,
there is no time.

01:12:06.017 --> 01:12:08.672
The clock stopped moving
the minute we were sentenced.

01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:25.602
People say
we should all live life

01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.908
like it could be taken away
at any moment.

01:12:29.693 --> 01:12:32.086
Death catches most people
unawares.

01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:34.393
You're asleep, or your body
shuts down,

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:35.873
or an accident happens,

01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:38.789
but to live every moment,
waiting,

01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:41.922
knowing that they could decide
to kill you at any moment...

01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:45.317
can't help picturing
the dents on the door

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:47.841
where others have kicked
and fought as they went in.

01:12:59.853 --> 01:13:01.377
Are you sure you want this one?

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.988
It's kind of a snooze, and jury
was only out for an hour.

01:13:04.031 --> 01:13:05.076
I got some better ones.

01:13:05.119 --> 01:13:06.599
-Just this one, please.
-All right.

01:13:06.643 --> 01:13:09.080
-Thanks, sir.
-You're welcome. Next.

01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:10.821
Hey.

01:13:15.956 --> 01:13:17.393
He wanted to get in so bad,

01:13:17.436 --> 01:13:19.786
he broke the windows
with a tire iron,

01:13:20.091 --> 01:13:22.572
but the fire just blew that
glass back at him.

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:26.184
I've never seen a man
cry so hard.

01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:33.104
He didn't try to save those
kids until the cops showed up.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.455
And it was like
he was putting on a show.

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:41.199
Don't surprise me,
he started that fire.

01:13:42.853 --> 01:13:44.898
This so-called art

01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:47.727
hung above
Todd Willingham's bed.

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:50.382
Dr. Grigson,
what can you tell us about it?

01:13:51.339 --> 01:13:54.691
In my experience, such images
of death and violence

01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:57.781
are often associated
with cultive type activities.

01:13:58.129 --> 01:14:00.740
It is my conclusion
that Todd Willingham

01:14:00.784 --> 01:14:04.265
is a severe sociopath
with violent tendencies.

01:14:05.049 --> 01:14:07.225
Is it true
that the police were called

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:09.575
to your home
to control a situation

01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:12.317
where Todd Willingham was
intoxicated,

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.234
and calling you a
"whore, bitch, and slut"?

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:19.150
Todd would do never do anything
to hurt those babies.

01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:21.108
He loved those babies
with all his heart.

01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:23.067
He treated those babies
better than anybody else did.

01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:24.416
Mr. Horton?

01:14:24.721 --> 01:14:26.200
No questions, Your Honor.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:38.996
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Horton.

01:14:39.039 --> 01:14:40.780
Well, you can thank my girl,
Ronda.

01:14:40.824 --> 01:14:42.565
-Yeah?
-She told me I had to see you,

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.131
so you would stop pestering her.

01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:46.525
Oh, well, I just wanted to get
your thoughts

01:14:46.569 --> 01:14:47.961
on Todd Willingham.

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:49.572
So, you knew him before?

01:14:50.181 --> 01:14:51.182
Oh, yeah.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.315
I guess everybody in town
knew him, huh?

01:14:54.707 --> 01:14:56.579
Cross the street to stay out
of the way is more like it.

01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:58.537
Nothing but trouble, that boy.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.539
Tell you a little story.

01:15:01.845 --> 01:15:03.890
Night after
Todd's children died,

01:15:04.848 --> 01:15:07.024
the whole town had a gathering
to raise money

01:15:07.415 --> 01:15:08.329
for their funeral.

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:11.071
He acted like
he'd just won the lottery.

01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:13.378
-Drinking, playing darts.

01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:15.075
Playing and whooping it up.

01:15:15.119 --> 01:15:17.556
And just because someone acts
inappropriately

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.124
doesn't mean they're a murderer,
though, right?

01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:22.605
You're right.

01:15:24.258 --> 01:15:27.044
What's inappropriate
is taking his part.

01:15:27.871 --> 01:15:29.916
Now, you seem like an educated
woman.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.312
He had the motive, he had the
means, the science backed it up.

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:37.184
What makes you so cock-sure
he's innocent?

01:15:38.621 --> 01:15:40.971
Honestly, I don't know
if he's innocent or not.

01:15:41.406 --> 01:15:43.626
The question is,
did he get a fair trial?

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:44.931
Let me guess.

01:15:44.975 --> 01:15:46.367
You've seen Todd
and he charmed you.

01:15:47.194 --> 01:15:49.588
He was quite the ladies' man
back in Corsicana.

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:51.111
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

01:15:51.938 --> 01:15:54.288
But what I do know,
is that you failed

01:15:54.332 --> 01:15:56.769
to challenge witnesses
that changed their story.

01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:58.815
You failed to reach out
to Todd's friends.

01:15:58.858 --> 01:16:01.774
You failed to find
a single scientific expert.

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.430
I am sorry, sir, but...
it seems like you barely tried

01:16:05.473 --> 01:16:07.432
to create reasonable doubt
in the jury's minds.

01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:08.781
Where did you get your law
degree, missy?

01:16:09.216 --> 01:16:10.609
State didn't give me
enough money

01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:12.263
to feed these horses
to defend that boy.

01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:13.873
-But I did the best I could.
-Yeah?

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:16.006
Yeah. And regardless
of your estimation

01:16:16.049 --> 01:16:17.660
of my professional abilities,

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:19.792
the fact remains,

01:16:20.837 --> 01:16:23.796
that boy is a monster,
and he will die.

01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:29.019
Worry about the living,
Ms. Gilbert.

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:31.325
Yeah, well, maybe,
you should do the same.

01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:35.112
We clearly have enough

01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:36.592
to file an appeal
with the Fifth Circuit.

01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:37.897
Now, I'm sorry, sir,

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:40.160
but this Horton seems like
a complete loser.

01:16:40.204 --> 01:16:43.424
I mean, he decided
Todd was guilty from the get-go.

01:16:43.468 --> 01:16:45.296
Yeah, granted Todd's trial
was a horror show,

01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:47.037
but it doesn't mean
he's innocent.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.995
But, then,
what about his appeal?

01:16:49.039 --> 01:16:52.216
Ms. Gilbert,
I appreciate your zeal.

01:16:52.477 --> 01:16:54.653
I worked this case for six
years, and got nowhere.

01:16:54.697 --> 01:16:57.090
There's so many others that
needed my help who I can help.

01:16:57.395 --> 01:17:00.703
-But, then, what if--
-They denied him habeas corpus.

01:17:00.746 --> 01:17:02.792
You're asking the state
to reopen a case

01:17:02.835 --> 01:17:03.967
based on character witnesses,

01:17:04.315 --> 01:17:06.360
when the primary factor
in this conviction

01:17:06.404 --> 01:17:07.971
was the arson investigation.

01:17:08.885 --> 01:17:12.192
Now, I have to agree with
the experts here, Ms. Gilbert.

01:17:12.845 --> 01:17:13.933
Fire does not lie.

01:17:15.326 --> 01:17:18.590
Look, you've been kind to him,
and I admire that.

01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:21.506
A personal involvement
can blind you to the truth.

01:17:21.767 --> 01:17:22.899
I've been there.

01:17:24.335 --> 01:17:25.771
Just don't let your emotions
get the better of you.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.949
My emotions? What?
'Cause I'm a woman?

01:17:30.428 --> 01:17:32.865
That's not what I meant.

01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:34.519
Well, then,
why don't you enlighten me?

01:17:36.521 --> 01:17:38.305
Have sympathy for the man
he's become,

01:17:38.741 --> 01:17:40.743
don't forget about
the man he was.

01:17:40.786 --> 01:17:42.919
Great. I'mma go
finish your job for you.

01:17:43.354 --> 01:17:44.485
Hold on a sec.

01:17:47.227 --> 01:17:48.968
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be rude,

01:17:49.012 --> 01:17:51.101
but it's just, it's been a long
road for me on this one,

01:17:51.144 --> 01:17:52.406
and I got to let it
go at some point.

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:53.494
But you know what?

01:17:53.538 --> 01:17:54.974
I've been reading this one file.

01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:57.281
This Johnny Webb character,
and his testimony

01:17:57.324 --> 01:17:58.978
seems like a complete lie.

01:17:59.022 --> 01:18:00.850
I mean, is there a way we can
get to him?

01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:15.952
Hey!

01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:18.563
Hey!

01:18:23.568 --> 01:18:25.048
Hey, how's it going?

01:18:25.396 --> 01:18:27.137
Are you from one of those
church groups?

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:30.009
No, uh, Judge Powell called you,
right?

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:32.011
Yeah.

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:33.709
Yeah, I've been...

01:18:34.405 --> 01:18:37.495
talking to some people
about Todd Willingham.

01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:40.063
Sounds familiar.

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:43.022
Yeah, you, talked to the court

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:45.808
about how he confessed to you...

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.115
about starting a fire
that killed his daughters.

01:18:51.814 --> 01:18:54.817
Right. Yeah, now I remember.

01:18:55.078 --> 01:18:57.602
It was sad. Real sad.

01:18:58.342 --> 01:19:01.649
Yeah, I've been reading
your testimony, carefully.

01:19:02.259 --> 01:19:04.174
Just wondering how all that
happened.

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:06.263
It's a long time ago, you know.

01:19:07.133 --> 01:19:09.222
Yeah, I can't remember
last week.

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:12.138
But it sure would help

01:19:13.009 --> 01:19:15.098
if there's anything
you could tell me.

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:18.579
Well... Uh...

01:19:19.667 --> 01:19:21.191
I was just sitting in my cell.

01:19:21.887 --> 01:19:25.543
You know? And... And this guy
gets put in with me.

01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:29.852
He's talking for a while and...

01:19:30.722 --> 01:19:32.419
he confessed to me right there.

01:19:33.159 --> 01:19:35.118
-That's about it.
-Just like that?

01:19:38.686 --> 01:19:41.864
You felt like you knew
Todd well, or...

01:19:42.168 --> 01:19:44.692
Like I said,
we shared a cell, so, you know.

01:19:47.913 --> 01:19:49.654
Why do you think
he confessed to you?

01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:54.833
I guess he just needed to tell
somebody.

01:19:55.312 --> 01:19:57.836
You know? Sometimes
a stranger's good for that.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.229
How's that work?

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:03.755
When you testify
in somebody else's case,

01:20:04.451 --> 01:20:08.151
they, um... give you
a reduced sentence or...

01:20:09.108 --> 01:20:10.327
did things change?

01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:13.243
You're a welder, huh?

01:20:14.157 --> 01:20:16.333
-Guess so.
-My dad, too.

01:20:17.247 --> 01:20:18.422
Is that what you wanted to do?

01:20:21.077 --> 01:20:22.818
Underwater welder, actually.

01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:24.645
-The coolest job.

01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:27.953
-Is that what you are now?
-I wish.

01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:31.261
I took a course, though,
been studying and shit,

01:20:31.304 --> 01:20:32.871
you know, I took it down in--

01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:34.046
Don't tell me, Houston?

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.920
-Houston. Yeah.
-At The Ocean Corporation?

01:20:37.963 --> 01:20:40.313
Yeah, damn right.
They got everything in there.

01:20:40.357 --> 01:20:42.446
-It's expensive.
-Yeah, you ain't kidding.

01:20:42.707 --> 01:20:45.362
-That's far from here, too.
-Yeah, you know.

01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:47.407
-Drove my truck, though.
-This one?

01:20:47.451 --> 01:20:50.236
-Yeah, yeah, that's my baby.
-Now, that is-- That's sweet.

01:20:50.628 --> 01:20:52.064
Almost got it new, too.

01:20:52.456 --> 01:20:54.371
Why are you asking me about all
this?

01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:55.807
How did you pay for this?

01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.811
Oh! I know what I wanted to
ask you.

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.814
Did Jackson,
the district attorney...

01:21:03.946 --> 01:21:06.165
did he promise you
a reduced sentence

01:21:06.209 --> 01:21:07.427
for that little story
you told?

01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:09.821
-I don't know. I--
-Did he do that to you?

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:10.996
-I don't know.
-Like promise

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.302
to take care of you?

01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:13.303
They do that?

01:21:14.565 --> 01:21:15.827
You know, I don't wanna
talk no more, so...

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:17.916
I'm sorry, Johnny, but...
was that the deal?

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.918
Yeah, but I ain't supposed
to talk about this stuff, so--

01:21:19.962 --> 01:21:21.920
Who told you not to talk about
it, the district attorney

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:24.401
is asking you not to talk,
and they're using you--

01:21:24.444 --> 01:21:25.881
It's time for you to leave,
lady--

01:21:25.924 --> 01:21:27.926
Listen to me, they are gonna
kill an innocent person.

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:29.580
And then you have to
live with it?

01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:30.886
-I'm done here!
-They're gonna kill

01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:32.539
an innocent man
and you have to live with it?

01:21:32.583 --> 01:21:34.150
You know, I got a gun.

01:21:38.284 --> 01:21:41.722
-All right. We're just talking.
-I'm done talking.

01:21:41.766 --> 01:21:43.681
Okay. All right, I'm not a cop.

01:21:46.597 --> 01:21:48.381
-Get the fuck outta here then!
-Okay.

01:21:54.257 --> 01:21:55.388
You could help.

01:21:56.737 --> 01:21:57.825
Please.

01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:04.528
He threatened you?

01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:06.660
That stupid motherfucker,
he threatened you?

01:22:06.704 --> 01:22:09.925
Mm-hmm. Listen to me,
his story stinks. You know why?

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:12.231
That guy's a snitch.

01:22:13.232 --> 01:22:15.974
I think the DA paid somebody
to pay him off.

01:22:16.018 --> 01:22:17.715
-He took a bribe?
-Mm-hmm.

01:22:18.107 --> 01:22:19.760
Oh, he's a spineless
piece of shit.

01:22:19.804 --> 01:22:21.849
But do you understand
what that means?

01:22:22.241 --> 01:22:25.853
We got a snitch,
a gas can that was never found

01:22:26.115 --> 01:22:28.247
-and Stacy's testimony.
-Yeah.

01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:29.509
Look at all this evidence.

01:22:30.989 --> 01:22:32.948
Reeve says there's no problem.
We've got plenty to go.

01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:34.688
File an appeal
with the Fifth Circuit.

01:22:34.732 --> 01:22:37.865
Fifth Circuit. I already spent
five of my appeals, Liz.

01:22:38.475 --> 01:22:40.956
-I only got one more left.
-But you got one more left.

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:42.914
It's gonna go the same way
as all the others.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:45.525
Todd, you've got one more.

01:22:53.925 --> 01:22:55.535
Do you think life is fair, Liz?

01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.104
Hell no.

01:23:01.628 --> 01:23:03.326
Do you think God
is all right with that?

01:23:03.587 --> 01:23:05.502
I don't think we know what His
plan is.

01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:07.939
I don't even try
to begin to imagine.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:14.990
I wanna live.

01:23:16.382 --> 01:23:18.471
That's why we're not gonna give
up for one second.

01:23:19.646 --> 01:23:20.865
Okay?

01:23:23.302 --> 01:23:24.738
So, life isn't fair.

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:28.916
What are we gonna do with that?

01:23:34.705 --> 01:23:38.187
I mean, maybe this, right now...

01:23:40.493 --> 01:23:42.147
is the best we get.

01:23:43.975 --> 01:23:45.716
Us being here for each other.

01:23:47.848 --> 01:23:49.720
Knowing how wrong it all this.

01:23:53.332 --> 01:23:54.812
Maybe this is the God part.

01:23:58.816 --> 01:24:02.907
All of us down here
trying to figure it all out.

01:24:21.969 --> 01:24:23.580
That's beautiful, baby.

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:27.888
Is this our house?

01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:34.025
Is that Mommy? Is she crying?

01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:37.898
She crying because I was
mean to her?

01:24:42.947 --> 01:24:44.079
Is this Daddy?

01:24:46.733 --> 01:24:48.213
Daddy was bad, huh?

01:24:54.045 --> 01:24:55.438
I'm sorry, baby.

01:24:59.877 --> 01:25:03.620
The doctor who testified that
Todd was a sociopath

01:25:03.663 --> 01:25:05.317
never even met him.

01:25:06.057 --> 01:25:07.406
That seems unfair.

01:25:07.711 --> 01:25:08.886
Exactly.

01:25:10.366 --> 01:25:11.454
Yeah.

01:25:11.497 --> 01:25:14.021
They bring him in
whenever they want

01:25:14.065 --> 01:25:15.719
a guaranteed death penalty.

01:25:16.633 --> 01:25:19.114
His nickname is Dr. Death.

01:25:19.462 --> 01:25:20.985
-Dr. Death?
-He...

01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:22.508
He was expelled

01:25:22.552 --> 01:25:24.771
from the American
Psychiatric Association

01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:28.906
"for making diagnosis
without meeting defendants."

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.387
This is why you read everything.

01:25:33.650 --> 01:25:35.913
I swear I'm gonna cook for you
tomorrow night.

01:25:35.956 --> 01:25:38.002
-That is just pitiful.
-I like cold pizza.

01:25:38.394 --> 01:25:40.570
I do, too, but at least
put it on a plate.

01:25:42.049 --> 01:25:45.749
Hey, you. Juls, did a Dr. Hurst
call when I was out?

01:25:45.792 --> 01:25:47.142
Nope. Bye.

01:25:47.185 --> 01:25:48.882
-Where you headed?
-Studying.

01:25:48.926 --> 01:25:50.145
With Dave?

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.627
You mean you actually know
his name?

01:25:57.195 --> 01:25:58.153
What?

01:26:01.199 --> 01:26:02.157
Look...

01:26:03.984 --> 01:26:04.985
What?

01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:07.510
I know how amazing it must be

01:26:07.553 --> 01:26:09.555
being pen pals
with a murderer...

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.254
but it's like you think

01:26:12.297 --> 01:26:13.603
you're some kind of hero
or something.

01:26:14.778 --> 01:26:16.214
Do you even know that Andrew

01:26:16.258 --> 01:26:17.694
is crying himself to sleep
at night

01:26:17.737 --> 01:26:19.043
because he misses Daddy?

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:23.569
You have no idea
what's going on around here.

01:26:26.703 --> 01:26:27.878
I do.

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:29.271
You don't.

01:26:29.923 --> 01:26:31.316
That's just not true.

01:26:36.495 --> 01:26:37.844
I'm sorry.

01:26:41.935 --> 01:26:43.633
I'm sorry, sweet pea.

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:47.941
Dallas is now inside the field

01:26:47.985 --> 01:26:49.987
goal range on the Arizona 37,

01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:51.249
second down and eight.

01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:52.859
Cowboys come
out of the shotgun.

01:26:52.903 --> 01:26:54.121
There's a snap.

01:26:54.165 --> 01:26:55.253
Cardinals coming
with the blitz,

01:26:55.297 --> 01:26:56.776
Huntington scrambling left.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.996
-It's picked off again.
-Come on.

01:26:59.039 --> 01:27:00.606
This time by Adrian Wilson.

01:27:01.128 --> 01:27:03.087
What kind of lame-ass excuse
for a quarterback

01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:05.089
throws three interceptions
in the first quarter?

01:27:05.132 --> 01:27:07.657
Hey, Willingham?
Cowboys suck.

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.659
-Hey, shut the fuck up.
-Whoever thought the Cowboys

01:27:09.702 --> 01:27:10.790
wouldn't make the playoffs

01:27:10.834 --> 01:27:12.227
-three years in a goddamn row.
-Yeah.

01:27:12.879 --> 01:27:14.185
It sucks.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:15.099
Unbelievable.

01:27:16.535 --> 01:27:17.275
Well, first of all,
we are talking

01:27:17.319 --> 01:27:18.450
about a man's life.

01:27:18.494 --> 01:27:19.538
So, now, you're spearheading
an effort

01:27:19.582 --> 01:27:21.105
to prove Todd's innocence?

01:27:21.148 --> 01:27:23.063
Well, I wouldn't say
spearheading,

01:27:23.107 --> 01:27:24.630
but I am helping
his lawyer.

01:27:25.152 --> 01:27:27.329
Todd's trial was
a complete travesty.

01:27:27.372 --> 01:27:28.808
What a great ball game...

01:27:28.852 --> 01:27:31.855
Hey, Willingham. They're talking
about you on the radio.

01:27:31.898 --> 01:27:34.249
Hey, Todd,
change the station, man.

01:27:35.815 --> 01:27:37.469
Which frequency are we on?

01:27:37.513 --> 01:27:38.514
It's 1060.

01:27:40.472 --> 01:27:41.908
...knew that I was going to

01:27:42.213 --> 01:27:44.911
supposedly meet
a killer, but...

01:27:45.999 --> 01:27:49.960
I found myself talking
to a vulnerable, sensitive man.

01:27:50.395 --> 01:27:52.179
He was very easy to talk to.

01:27:52.223 --> 01:27:53.877
How do you expect to change
people's minds

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.053
who know of Todd's past,

01:27:56.096 --> 01:27:59.883
that he beat his wife in front
of multiple witnesses but--

01:27:59.926 --> 01:28:01.798
I mean, have you
ever been cruel to someone

01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:03.843
in your life?
That make you a murderer?

01:28:04.148 --> 01:28:05.018
No.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:09.719
Uh, it was very clear
that witness testimony

01:28:09.762 --> 01:28:11.895
changed from the time
they talked to the police,

01:28:11.938 --> 01:28:13.766
to the time they were
in a courtroom.

01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:15.768
There's new DNA
evidence in this case.

01:28:15.812 --> 01:28:17.727
There may be new fire evidence.

01:28:17.770 --> 01:28:20.425
There are more questions
to answer here.

01:28:20.469 --> 01:28:22.122
So,
what you're telling me is

01:28:22.166 --> 01:28:24.821
you believe that
Todd is innocent?

01:28:27.563 --> 01:28:28.651
Yes, I am.

01:28:29.782 --> 01:28:31.001
I believe the State of Texas

01:28:31.044 --> 01:28:32.916
is about to kill
an innocent man.

01:28:34.526 --> 01:28:36.398
Would you wanna
kill an innocent man?

01:28:37.355 --> 01:28:39.923
There is more than enough
evidence

01:28:39.966 --> 01:28:42.099
for Todd to be
granted an appeal.

01:28:42.142 --> 01:28:43.796
If there's any question...

01:28:45.058 --> 01:28:47.365
-Hey.
-...evidence or any...

01:28:47.409 --> 01:28:48.714
Your date's been set.

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:51.413
February 17th.

01:29:18.483 --> 01:29:19.702
Now I feel excited.

01:29:21.268 --> 01:29:23.314
I read something on somebody
who's supposed to be, like,

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:26.404
the world expert on fires.
His name's Hurst.

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:28.145
I've got a message to him

01:29:28.188 --> 01:29:30.103
and found out
he lives in Austin.

01:29:30.582 --> 01:29:32.584
And I just feel like
that's what we need.

01:29:32.628 --> 01:29:35.152
You know, we need an expert
who can come in

01:29:35.195 --> 01:29:37.807
and challenge this absurdity.

01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:39.548
Liz, I'm not here to be saved.

01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:42.551
-Well, I'm not--
-I'm not a character

01:29:42.594 --> 01:29:45.510
in one of your fucking plays
or a pretend boyfriend,

01:29:45.554 --> 01:29:48.861
or someone here to percolate
some excitement

01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:52.082
in your otherwise boring,
ex-fucking housewife life.

01:29:54.214 --> 01:29:55.781
I am here to die.

01:30:01.874 --> 01:30:05.356
These are my last days, Liz,
not yours.

01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:09.621
And I don't need them filled up
with your false hope.

01:30:11.667 --> 01:30:15.410
Now, I am grateful for all
the faith you've had in me.

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:18.891
All the work, everything,

01:30:18.935 --> 01:30:21.416
but it don't matter
what truth you find now.

01:30:21.459 --> 01:30:23.069
It ain't gonna make
no difference.

01:30:30.729 --> 01:30:31.730
I lied, Liz.

01:30:34.341 --> 01:30:35.473
I lied to you.

01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:41.392
I lied to everybody.

01:30:47.529 --> 01:30:50.227
I said I went in straight
to the girls' room, which I did.

01:30:51.054 --> 01:30:53.926
Crawled over to them,
burning shit falling on me

01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:56.363
and smoke everywhere,
everything was on fire.

01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:01.281
I tried to get in,
but I couldn't

01:31:01.325 --> 01:31:02.500
'cause it was too hot.

01:31:04.328 --> 01:31:05.416
Amber!

01:31:11.944 --> 01:31:13.468
I already knew that they...

01:31:54.552 --> 01:31:56.685
I was too afraid to...

01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.343
I was too afraid to see my own
kids burning to death.

01:32:12.396 --> 01:32:14.441
I wanted to go back in,
but I couldn't

01:32:14.485 --> 01:32:15.704
'cause I was too afraid.

01:32:20.796 --> 01:32:22.275
So I am guilty.

01:32:29.979 --> 01:32:32.982
Any man who can't save his own
kids don't deserve to live.

01:32:51.348 --> 01:32:52.828
He wants to stop.

01:32:55.744 --> 01:32:59.138
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we're just torturing him.

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.578
I mean, what chance have we got
honestly?

01:33:06.668 --> 01:33:09.671
Doesn't matter. How many
think...

01:33:10.846 --> 01:33:12.587
You think this is just about
Todd?

01:33:14.023 --> 01:33:16.373
System doesn't work,
it's broken.

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:20.377
How many others out there
you think been fucked over?

01:33:26.252 --> 01:33:27.297
Yeah.

01:33:28.515 --> 01:33:30.909
For a while there,
we was crazy in love.

01:33:32.824 --> 01:33:35.871
And then we got married
after the twins was born and...

01:33:37.524 --> 01:33:40.745
I thought that meant
he really loved me, but...

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:44.923
now I think he was just doing it
for them.

01:33:45.228 --> 01:33:48.013
Well, Stacy, if there's anything
you can remember

01:33:48.057 --> 01:33:49.667
that we could use to save him...

01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.235
this is it.

01:33:53.323 --> 01:33:54.672
They're about to kill him.

01:33:58.110 --> 01:33:59.329
I know that, yeah.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.070
Please help us.

01:34:06.379 --> 01:34:09.252
My brother, he's police.

01:34:12.342 --> 01:34:15.911
He says, Todd gets off,
they're gonna come after me

01:34:15.954 --> 01:34:18.000
and persecute me and Todd's
gonna help them do it.

01:34:18.043 --> 01:34:19.915
I don't wanna go to jail
instead of him.

01:34:21.699 --> 01:34:23.005
That's crazy.

01:34:25.355 --> 01:34:26.878
Todd loves you.

01:34:27.749 --> 01:34:31.230
He talks about you all the time.
You need to go see him.

01:34:34.016 --> 01:34:35.670
Mm-mm. I can't do that.

01:34:35.931 --> 01:34:40.152
Stacy, he was the father
of your babies.

01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:46.028
And he's changed.
Please, just go see him.

01:34:56.516 --> 01:34:57.909
-Hey, honey.
-Oh, hey, Mom.

01:34:58.214 --> 01:34:59.955
Hey, a doctor left you
a message.

01:34:59.998 --> 01:35:01.608
-Doctor Hu--
-Hurst?

01:35:01.652 --> 01:35:02.784
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

01:35:02.827 --> 01:35:04.133
Wait. Mom, is everything okay?

01:35:05.134 --> 01:35:06.831
Yeah, buddy,
not that kind of doctor.

01:35:06.875 --> 01:35:08.224
-All right.
-Have a great day.

01:35:08.267 --> 01:35:09.660
-All right.
-Okay.

01:35:23.848 --> 01:35:26.851
We're so grateful
that you're willing to dive in

01:35:26.895 --> 01:35:28.287
like this. I mean--

01:35:28.331 --> 01:35:30.725
What's your sign?

01:35:32.204 --> 01:35:34.641
-Excuse me?
-Under what sign

01:35:34.685 --> 01:35:36.905
of the zodiac were you born?

01:35:38.341 --> 01:35:40.125
-Aries.
-And your horoscope,

01:35:40.169 --> 01:35:41.213
do you read it?

01:35:42.475 --> 01:35:44.434
-Sometimes, I guess.
-Sometimes it's right

01:35:44.477 --> 01:35:47.437
-and sometimes it's wrong.
-Well, all that stuff is just...

01:35:47.829 --> 01:35:51.658
People have always been
fascinated

01:35:52.050 --> 01:35:55.271
by the stars, they chartered
their movements.

01:35:55.314 --> 01:35:59.492
They could tell you
when Mercury was retrograde

01:35:59.536 --> 01:36:02.539
or when Mars was aligned
with Venus.

01:36:03.496 --> 01:36:08.806
They made predictions
based on these observations.

01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:11.896
These people were called
astrologers.

01:36:12.941 --> 01:36:15.770
They were the experts
on the solar system.

01:36:16.335 --> 01:36:18.903
Until the science of astronomy
came along

01:36:18.947 --> 01:36:22.037
and proved their ideas
to be nothing but bullpucky.

01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:27.303
I've studied the report
their experts wrote.

01:36:39.141 --> 01:36:40.142
Follow me.

01:36:42.187 --> 01:36:44.624
-Move your feet.
-Oh!

01:37:06.168 --> 01:37:07.256
What do you see?

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.171
Oh...

01:37:10.346 --> 01:37:12.827
-nothing?
-Exactly. No burn signature.

01:37:13.915 --> 01:37:18.267
And no such thing
as crazed glass either.

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.144
The spider pattern happens...

01:37:27.711 --> 01:37:30.453
when it's hit by cold water
from the fire hoses.

01:37:31.454 --> 01:37:33.325
-Ah!

01:37:35.066 --> 01:37:39.984
I spent two days going over
every detail of this case.

01:37:40.419 --> 01:37:42.769
Thing about investigators
is they tend to find

01:37:42.813 --> 01:37:46.121
what they're looking for,
even if it isn't there.

01:37:47.252 --> 01:37:49.776
They'd already decided
Todd was guilty

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.822
before they walked
into that house.

01:37:52.997 --> 01:37:55.217
They were so sure it was arson,

01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.784
they didn't even bother to
check the space heater.

01:37:59.612 --> 01:38:01.919
Whoever installed
the electrical wiring

01:38:01.963 --> 01:38:04.313
had never even heard
of a Safety Code.

01:38:06.619 --> 01:38:08.012
- Girls?
- Those flames

01:38:08.056 --> 01:38:09.579
ran up the ceiling

01:38:09.622 --> 01:38:12.538
burning the walls,
before moving their way down.

01:38:12.582 --> 01:38:13.626
Daddy!

01:38:15.193 --> 01:38:16.194
The fire was
what we call a flashover.

01:38:17.674 --> 01:38:19.328
Instant combustion
of everything flammable.

01:38:19.371 --> 01:38:22.070
The V pattern the experts
found...

01:38:22.374 --> 01:38:24.550
also a signature of a
flashover.

01:38:28.728 --> 01:38:30.513
The accelerant on the porch.

01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:33.516
Charcoal grill
and lighter fluid

01:38:33.559 --> 01:38:35.997
the expert somehow neglected
to mention.

01:38:38.434 --> 01:38:40.915
My babies are burning up!

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.918
And the refrigerator
that blocked the back door?

01:38:46.007 --> 01:38:48.487
Linoleum underneath is
untouched.

01:38:48.531 --> 01:38:50.402
It was always there,
never been moved.

01:38:53.405 --> 01:38:55.973
My report is based on hundreds
of hours of experiments

01:38:56.017 --> 01:38:57.975
by the most rigorous scientists
in the field,

01:38:58.019 --> 01:38:59.934
these so-called experts
of theirs

01:38:59.977 --> 01:39:01.370
may have seen lots of fires,

01:39:01.413 --> 01:39:03.938
but in the end,
they're just astrologers.

01:39:06.331 --> 01:39:09.421
-Thank you, Mr. Hurst.
-Thank you so much.

01:39:09.465 --> 01:39:11.293
There's also just one more thing

01:39:11.336 --> 01:39:14.513
-that we have to...
-What we owe you.

01:39:14.557 --> 01:39:16.994
I don't believe in astrology,
Ms. Gilbert,

01:39:18.039 --> 01:39:19.736
but I do believe in karma.

01:39:20.171 --> 01:39:23.044
Mine can use all the help it can
get. The pleasure's mine.

01:39:25.307 --> 01:39:27.526
Todd, we got Hurst.
Listen to me.

01:39:27.918 --> 01:39:30.965
We got to Hurst.
We got to him.

01:39:31.008 --> 01:39:33.097
He said there's no way
that fire was arson.

01:39:33.141 --> 01:39:34.272
You know what that means?

01:39:34.316 --> 01:39:35.926
If there's no arson,
there's no crime.

01:39:36.144 --> 01:39:38.537
-Can you believe it?
-No, I can't.

01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:40.496
-Oh, my God.
-It's just like

01:39:40.539 --> 01:39:41.976
I've been saying the whole time.

01:39:42.019 --> 01:39:44.108
Well, Reeves is on his way
to Parole Board right now.

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.110
He said there's no way
they won't regard this

01:39:46.154 --> 01:39:47.242
as exculpatory evidence.

01:39:49.635 --> 01:39:52.421
Todd, we have a real chance.

01:39:55.163 --> 01:39:57.121
Oh, I don't know, Liz.

01:39:59.428 --> 01:40:01.473
I'm not fixing to start
hoping again.

01:40:02.431 --> 01:40:03.519
Hope is bad.

01:40:03.867 --> 01:40:05.608
I got 10 days left.

01:40:05.651 --> 01:40:07.784
If I start hoping again,
them 10 days is gonna go by

01:40:07.827 --> 01:40:11.788
-just like that.
-I understand, but I'm hoping.

01:40:19.535 --> 01:40:21.058
You know what I was ruminating
on just now

01:40:21.102 --> 01:40:22.538
while I was waiting
for you?

01:40:22.581 --> 01:40:26.194
-What?
-After all them terrible things

01:40:26.237 --> 01:40:28.239
I said to you,
I thought you'd given up on me.

01:40:30.894 --> 01:40:31.764
Never.

01:40:47.302 --> 01:40:48.390
Never.

01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:59.923
-Irene?
-Yes?

01:40:59.966 --> 01:41:01.577
I need to get this copy
of Hurst's report

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.709
over to the Board
of Pardons and Paroles.

01:41:03.753 --> 01:41:04.754
All right?

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.062
Second thought, got this.
Thank you. Sorry.

01:41:11.239 --> 01:41:12.849
-Hi, Cindy.
-Hi, Skip.

01:41:12.892 --> 01:41:15.286
I was wondering
if you can get this out ASAP?

01:41:15.330 --> 01:41:17.158
-Sure thing.
-Thanks so much.

01:41:17.201 --> 01:41:19.029
-You have a good one.
-You too.

01:41:36.655 --> 01:41:39.702
This fax just came in
from the Parole Board, sir.

01:41:45.142 --> 01:41:46.883
How can they deny it without
reading it?

01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:49.712
No need-- No, no, no.

01:41:49.755 --> 01:41:51.888
It's a new interpretation
of existing evidence

01:41:51.931 --> 01:41:54.456
using scientific methods
that weren't available then.

01:41:55.239 --> 01:41:57.415
That constitutes new evidence.

01:41:59.330 --> 01:42:01.289
How could they not even meet?

01:42:01.724 --> 01:42:03.900
It-- Hello? Hello?

01:42:08.122 --> 01:42:10.602
Irene, I want a--
I want a draft in appeal

01:42:10.646 --> 01:42:12.561
for a 30-day stay of execution.

01:42:13.083 --> 01:42:15.564
You don't have to shout.
There's an intercom, you know.

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.007
And find out how late
the governor's office is open.

01:42:33.234 --> 01:42:34.148
Hi.

01:42:35.279 --> 01:42:36.237
Hi.

01:42:38.239 --> 01:42:39.153
Thanks for coming.

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.852
How you been?

01:42:46.072 --> 01:42:47.335
-Good.
-Good.

01:42:49.032 --> 01:42:50.120
You look good.

01:42:51.252 --> 01:42:52.949
-No, I don't.
-Yeah, you do.

01:42:53.602 --> 01:42:54.907
Them eyes, now.

01:43:00.783 --> 01:43:02.785
You been wanting me to come here
all these years,

01:43:02.828 --> 01:43:04.178
what's on your mind?

01:43:06.789 --> 01:43:09.139
Ms. Gilbert says my only chance
now

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:11.010
is stay of execution
from the Governor.

01:43:12.316 --> 01:43:13.970
I just need a statement
from you.

01:43:15.493 --> 01:43:16.799
I don't think that

01:43:16.842 --> 01:43:18.496
-I can do that, Todd.
-Why not?

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.758
You know I already wrote
a letter

01:43:19.802 --> 01:43:21.020
to Governor Ann Richards

01:43:21.064 --> 01:43:22.326
trying to defend you,
she didn't respond.

01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:23.632
You just gotta go
to Governor Perry.

01:43:23.675 --> 01:43:24.807
Otherwise,
I don't get my pardon.

01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:26.330
I've been the only one
defending you

01:43:26.374 --> 01:43:28.245
-this whole time.
-What's stopping you now then?

01:43:28.289 --> 01:43:30.247
A lot of things.
Grandma. Do you have any idea

01:43:30.291 --> 01:43:31.727
how many people
don't want me to do that?

01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:33.032
Well, there's only you.

01:43:35.948 --> 01:43:37.689
I just don't think that
I can do that.

01:43:37.733 --> 01:43:39.735
-Why'd you come here then?
-We were married,

01:43:39.778 --> 01:43:41.780
-weren't we? I figured I should.
-That ain't the reason.

01:43:42.041 --> 01:43:44.392
I think you feel guilty you
never helped me with my case.

01:43:44.435 --> 01:43:47.177
-Hold on a second.
-Where'd all that money go, huh?

01:43:47.395 --> 01:43:48.657
-What?
-All the insurance money

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:50.049
I could've used
to get me a lawyer?

01:43:50.093 --> 01:43:51.355
To me trying to survive

01:43:51.399 --> 01:43:52.617
-and rebuild my life.
-To you?

01:43:52.661 --> 01:43:53.662
Making your hair look nice?

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.274
-Them nails look expensive.
-Yeah. That's where it went.

01:43:57.318 --> 01:43:58.710
Making yourself look pretty
around town.

01:43:58.754 --> 01:44:00.669
-Wow.
-While you cut me off.

01:44:00.712 --> 01:44:03.367
-Fucked all kinds of idiots.
-Oh, you should talk.

01:44:03.411 --> 01:44:05.021
Do you have any idea
the stories I have to sit

01:44:05.064 --> 01:44:06.718
and listen to, all the girls
wanna brag about

01:44:06.762 --> 01:44:08.111
fucking a guy
on death row?

01:44:08.154 --> 01:44:09.286
It's all true.

01:44:09.330 --> 01:44:10.940
-It's all true.
-Yeah, I know.

01:44:10.983 --> 01:44:14.335
-They all fuck the baby killer.
-Wow. You haven't changed a bit.

01:44:14.378 --> 01:44:16.206
How the fuck would you know?

01:44:17.076 --> 01:44:18.861
How the fuck would you know,
huh?

01:44:18.904 --> 01:44:20.602
Because I know you,
Todd Willingham.

01:44:20.645 --> 01:44:22.038
Twelve years, bitch.

01:44:22.081 --> 01:44:24.083
Twelve years it's taken you
to pluck up the courage

01:44:24.127 --> 01:44:25.084
to come see me.

01:44:25.346 --> 01:44:26.651
Why didn't you
come see me once?

01:44:26.695 --> 01:44:29.132
Because they told me
that you killed my babies!

01:44:29.175 --> 01:44:31.308
Hey, that's enough.

01:44:42.406 --> 01:44:43.799
But you know I didn't.

01:44:45.322 --> 01:44:48.369
You know I wouldn't hurt them
kids, Stacy. You know.

01:44:50.458 --> 01:44:53.983
I spent 12 years thinking about
it now. I remember everything.

01:44:54.766 --> 01:44:58.030
I remember everything, Stacy.
And I'm sorry, I apologize

01:44:58.074 --> 01:45:00.946
if I ever hurt you,
but I loved you, Stacy.

01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:02.731
-Todd, please, stop it.
-I loved you.

01:45:02.774 --> 01:45:04.646
Now, we made three beautiful
children.

01:45:04.689 --> 01:45:05.908
-They're gone--
-No, please stop.

01:45:05.951 --> 01:45:07.344
...and I am paying for it now.

01:45:07.388 --> 01:45:09.390
But I'm just asking this one
thing now, please.

01:45:09.433 --> 01:45:10.739
No.

01:45:10.782 --> 01:45:12.218
-I'm begging you.
-Oh, God.

01:45:12.262 --> 01:45:14.482
-Just this one thing, please.
-I'm sorry, I got to go.

01:45:36.721 --> 01:45:37.722
Hey.

01:45:38.419 --> 01:45:39.376
They're...

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:42.988
They're moving you closer
to the chamber.

01:45:51.954 --> 01:45:55.087
-You're done, fucker.
-Mind the wind, brother.

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.745
Go gently, my friend.

01:46:06.055 --> 01:46:07.578
Keep your head up, Todd.

01:46:08.884 --> 01:46:11.016
- Be strong, brother.
- Be strong.

01:46:11.887 --> 01:46:14.542
Hey, you remember that
Hail Mary?

01:46:14.585 --> 01:46:17.414
Roger Staubach through
in the playoffs

01:46:17.458 --> 01:46:19.416
against the Vikings
in '75?

01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.461
Yes, sir.

01:46:22.941 --> 01:46:23.942
Come on.

01:46:27.772 --> 01:46:29.600
Down 14-10...

01:46:31.559 --> 01:46:33.474
24 seconds left.

01:46:34.170 --> 01:46:36.041
He just rears back...

01:46:36.694 --> 01:46:38.435
and lets that baby fly.

01:46:40.959 --> 01:46:45.224
And somehow, it bounces off
the defensive halfback...

01:46:46.922 --> 01:46:50.882
and right into the hand
of Drew Pearson...

01:46:52.623 --> 01:46:54.277
touchdown Cowboys.

01:46:55.234 --> 01:46:56.671
Unbelievable.

01:47:01.284 --> 01:47:02.590
It's what you need, brother.

01:47:04.722 --> 01:47:05.854
A Hail Mary.

01:47:10.772 --> 01:47:12.251
I wish I could throw it for you.

01:47:20.738 --> 01:47:22.392
...thy womb, Jesus.

01:47:23.219 --> 01:47:25.047
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

01:47:26.657 --> 01:47:28.224
pray for us sinners, now...

01:47:29.747 --> 01:47:32.750
and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

01:47:32.794 --> 01:47:35.840
For Todd Willingham scheduled
to be executed

01:47:35.884 --> 01:47:36.928
in just five days.

01:47:38.321 --> 01:47:41.063
This marks the end
of a 12-year-old...

01:47:41.106 --> 01:47:44.806
Hey, you got a pen and paper,
or something?

01:47:46.547 --> 01:47:47.635
Here you go.

01:47:49.071 --> 01:47:50.028
...Todd Willingham's fate.

01:47:51.421 --> 01:47:53.554
This is a town of good
and simple people.

01:47:55.904 --> 01:47:57.688
To whom it may concern.

01:47:58.559 --> 01:48:01.475
My name is Johnny Webb.

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:06.088
I was forced to testify against
Mr. Willingham by

01:48:06.131 --> 01:48:09.787
the district attorney's office
and other officials.

01:48:10.179 --> 01:48:11.963
I'm given no other choice,

01:48:12.311 --> 01:48:15.314
but to recant my testimony
at this time.

01:48:16.185 --> 01:48:19.754
Mr. Willingham is innocent
of all charges.

01:48:31.026 --> 01:48:33.202
They're gonna take Daddy
away now, honey.

01:48:38.207 --> 01:48:40.339
I don't know.
They just say it's my time.

01:48:47.085 --> 01:48:48.783
I'm gonna miss you too.

01:48:50.654 --> 01:48:52.264
I'm gonna really miss you.

01:48:59.141 --> 01:49:01.012
That day in the fire, if I...

01:49:03.493 --> 01:49:05.103
If I could've just saved you.

01:49:11.370 --> 01:49:12.371
Amber.

01:49:22.207 --> 01:49:23.513
Come on, honey.

01:49:23.557 --> 01:49:24.558
It'll be okay.

01:49:25.254 --> 01:49:27.125
Just let your brother do
all the talking.

01:49:30.607 --> 01:49:32.870
Ms. Kuykendall, what do you have
to share with us?

01:49:32.914 --> 01:49:34.698
Can you tell us what happened?

01:49:34.742 --> 01:49:36.570
Can you tell us
what happened, please?

01:49:36.613 --> 01:49:37.788
What would you like to share?

01:49:39.877 --> 01:49:42.140
Regardless of what's been said
in the past,

01:49:42.663 --> 01:49:44.578
I have here my affidavit.

01:49:46.667 --> 01:49:49.017
It says Todd confessed to her
when she visited him in prison.

01:49:49.974 --> 01:49:51.628
Texas is doing the right thing

01:49:51.672 --> 01:49:53.325
making that monster pay for
what he did.

01:49:53.369 --> 01:49:55.458
Come on.
That's all we have to say.

01:50:06.687 --> 01:50:10.299
You know her granddaddy took out
an insurance policy on the kids?

01:50:12.518 --> 01:50:14.433
Cashed it right after the fire.

01:50:17.523 --> 01:50:18.612
She's terrified.

01:50:21.005 --> 01:50:23.573
They're all running scared
after this Hurst report.

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.449
I asked my mom and dad
not to come.

01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:33.191
It would be too much for them.

01:50:34.671 --> 01:50:35.629
Yeah.

01:50:39.284 --> 01:50:42.418
You know, the report's on
the Governor's desk right now.

01:50:42.461 --> 01:50:43.637
Governor Perry?

01:50:45.029 --> 01:50:46.030
Yeah.

01:51:01.263 --> 01:51:03.047
I'm getting scared now, Liz.

01:51:06.747 --> 01:51:08.139
Not about dying.

01:51:09.271 --> 01:51:12.404
They said it's gonna hurt,
they say it hurts so much.

01:51:22.066 --> 01:51:23.589
You're gonna be there, right?

01:51:27.637 --> 01:51:28.507
Promise.

01:51:30.248 --> 01:51:31.119
Good.

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.341
I don't wanna die alone.

01:51:42.434 --> 01:51:45.568
Mama, are you okay?

01:51:50.399 --> 01:51:52.140
They're gonna kill him tomorrow.

01:51:57.623 --> 01:51:58.712
I failed.

01:51:59.669 --> 01:52:00.670
No.

01:52:06.458 --> 01:52:10.071
I let him down.
If I had found Hurst sooner...

01:52:10.767 --> 01:52:13.204
No, Mama.
No, Mama, you didn't.

01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:16.164
You did so much for him.

01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:20.690
I guess I thought
the right thing would win.

01:52:23.258 --> 01:52:25.651
I thought the right thing
would win.

01:52:29.655 --> 01:52:30.613
I'm sorry.

01:52:32.006 --> 01:52:35.531
-I'm so, so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

01:52:36.445 --> 01:52:39.622
That you had to learn such
a shitty truth about the world.

01:52:41.842 --> 01:52:42.756
No.

01:53:05.387 --> 01:53:08.433
Paul, I am telling you
the Governor has not read this.

01:53:10.261 --> 01:53:12.698
Because it's proof.

01:53:13.569 --> 01:53:16.790
Just please find somebody
who will make him read it.

01:53:29.411 --> 01:53:30.978
- Yo!
- Yeah?

01:53:31.021 --> 01:53:32.066
How long?

01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:33.545
Hour and a half maybe.

01:53:34.895 --> 01:53:36.244
Ain't nobody called?

01:53:37.462 --> 01:53:38.681
I'm sorry, brother.

01:53:38.986 --> 01:53:41.162
I'm definitely expecting
a phone call, boss.

01:53:41.205 --> 01:53:43.164
-I know.
-Elizabeth Gilbert,

01:53:43.207 --> 01:53:45.122
you let me know
the second she calls, right?

01:53:45.166 --> 01:53:46.167
I promise.

01:53:53.304 --> 01:53:54.392
You all right?

01:53:57.787 --> 01:53:58.875
Yeah, I know.

01:54:03.053 --> 01:54:04.098
Fuck.

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:10.931
She's critical, but stable.

01:54:10.974 --> 01:54:12.628
We're confident
she'll pull through.

01:54:13.498 --> 01:54:15.631
Unfortunately,
her neck is broken.

01:54:16.066 --> 01:54:18.286
We're not sure if she'll ever be
able to walk again.

01:54:21.245 --> 01:54:23.204
They're taking her into surgery
now.

01:54:56.672 --> 01:54:57.673
Shit.

01:55:03.592 --> 01:55:04.593
It's time.

01:55:07.074 --> 01:55:08.510
Come on, now, get up.

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:12.993
All right. Let's do it.

01:55:18.215 --> 01:55:20.870
Are you ready? One, two, three.

01:55:20.914 --> 01:55:22.480
No!

01:55:23.742 --> 01:55:24.743
No!

01:55:25.527 --> 01:55:26.528
No!

01:55:27.616 --> 01:55:28.878
No!

01:56:04.261 --> 01:56:05.915
She don't have to be here,
does she?

01:56:05.959 --> 01:56:07.569
-It doesn't matter, brother.
-My ex-wife.

01:56:07.612 --> 01:56:08.613
I can't do that.

01:56:13.705 --> 01:56:15.969
I hope you rot in hell,
you bitch!

01:56:18.449 --> 01:56:20.234
You have any final words, son?

01:56:20.538 --> 01:56:21.670
Yes, sir.

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:28.764
I am an innocent man.

01:56:30.374 --> 01:56:33.987
Convicted of unspeakably heinous
crime, which I did not commit.

01:56:35.858 --> 01:56:38.382
Twelve years
I've been wrongly persecuted...

01:56:41.081 --> 01:56:43.605
despite me
maintaining my innocence.

01:56:47.217 --> 01:56:50.046
It is my dying wish
that my body be cremated.

01:56:53.441 --> 01:56:56.922
And then my ashes spread across
my daughter's graves.

01:57:03.799 --> 01:57:05.583
From God's dust I came...

01:57:08.064 --> 01:57:11.589
now, to God's dust
I judiciously return.

01:57:16.551 --> 01:57:18.683
Then the earth shall be
my throne.

01:57:23.123 --> 01:57:24.385
All right then, y'all.

01:59:53.055 --> 01:59:54.056
Thank you.

02:00:12.161 --> 02:00:13.293
Hey, groovy lady.

02:00:13.858 --> 02:00:15.643
I'm wondering where you are.

02:00:16.905 --> 02:00:19.037
I guess something big
must have come up.

02:00:20.952 --> 02:00:22.954
When you read this,
I'll be gone,

02:00:23.825 --> 02:00:26.436
but I wanted to tell you
about this dream I had.

02:00:28.830 --> 02:00:31.485
Me and my girls are out
for a walk or some such.

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:34.052
-Can you get me one?
-No, not that one.

02:00:34.096 --> 02:00:35.967
I don't want that one.
Get me-- Get me this one.

02:00:36.751 --> 02:00:38.492
-Good.
-I got two.

02:00:38.535 --> 02:00:40.755
It was one of those cool,
fall days.

02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:43.975
Football weather
my daddy used to call it.

02:00:44.019 --> 02:00:45.020
You got that for me?

02:00:46.630 --> 02:00:48.023
Today was the last day,
yesterday was the last day,

02:00:48.066 --> 02:00:50.243
today we're doing it, this week,
next week...

02:00:50.286 --> 02:00:52.419
Funny thing is,
you were there too.

02:00:53.637 --> 02:00:55.465
Out for a walk, I guess.

02:01:25.016 --> 02:01:25.930
Okay.

02:01:35.592 --> 02:01:37.333
I suppose there's lots
of reasons

02:01:37.377 --> 02:01:38.682
to feel sorry for myself.

02:01:40.118 --> 02:01:41.903
My greatest regret
is not being allowed

02:01:41.946 --> 02:01:43.557
to be buried beside my girls.

02:01:45.254 --> 02:01:49.389
But thanks to you,
I have tried to make my peace.

02:01:57.222 --> 02:01:59.573
You showed me that love
is always there

02:01:59.616 --> 02:02:01.314
if you just
open yourself to it.

02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:04.926
You helped me to learn to enjoy
the simple blessings

02:02:04.969 --> 02:02:05.883
of being alive.

02:02:07.407 --> 02:02:09.583
I only wish I had something
to give you in return.

02:02:10.453 --> 02:02:12.890
Besides my love, always.

02:02:14.283 --> 02:02:16.894
Yours truly, Todd.

02:02:18.722 --> 02:02:20.245
Okay. Let's go.

02:03:12.472 --> 02:03:14.474
Governor Perry,
question about Texas.

02:03:15.344 --> 02:03:19.217
Your State has executed
234 death row inmates,

02:03:19.261 --> 02:03:21.611
more than any other governor
in modern times.

02:03:22.090 --> 02:03:24.222
-Have you--

02:03:24.266 --> 02:03:26.747
Have you struggled
to sleep at night

02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:30.141
with the idea that
any one of those

02:03:30.185 --> 02:03:32.317
might have been innocent?

02:03:32.361 --> 02:03:34.581
No, sir, I've never struggled
with that at all.

02:03:34.885 --> 02:03:39.499
The State of Texas
has a very thoughtful,

02:03:40.238 --> 02:03:42.632
a very clear...

02:03:44.199 --> 02:03:46.854
process in place
of which when someone commits

02:03:46.897 --> 02:03:49.683
the most heinous of crimes
against our citizens,

02:03:50.074 --> 02:03:53.774
they get a fair hearing, they go
through an appellate process.

02:03:54.252 --> 02:03:56.820
They go up to the Supreme Court
of United States

02:03:56.864 --> 02:03:58.343
if that's required,

02:03:58.387 --> 02:04:02.217
but in the State of Texas,
if you come in to our state,

02:04:02.652 --> 02:04:04.306
and you kill
one of our children,

02:04:04.698 --> 02:04:06.221
you kill a police officer,

02:04:06.264 --> 02:04:08.049
you're involved with
another crime

02:04:08.092 --> 02:04:09.746
and you kill
one of our citizens,

02:04:10.617 --> 02:04:14.925
you will face the ultimate
justice in the State of Texas.

02:04:14.969 --> 02:04:17.145
And that is
you will be executed.

02:04:17.188 --> 02:04:18.842
What do you make of--

02:04:19.305 --> 02:04:25.200
