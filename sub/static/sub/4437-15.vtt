<i>Man on radio:
Watch out, Gravity Falls,</i>

00:03.212 --> 00:04.338
<i>because at 110 degrees</i>

00:04.546 --> 00:07.345
<i>we're looking at
the hottest day of the summer!</i>

00:15.724 --> 00:19.695
All in favor of doing nothing
all day, say... ( groans)

00:20.145 --> 00:22.113
( all groan )

00:22.314 --> 00:23.236
(Oinks)

00:23.440 --> 00:25.534
I'm gonna throw this pig
out of the house!

00:27.027 --> 00:28.745
You called my bluff, pig.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.369
<i>On the bright side,
pun very much intended,</i>

00:31.573 --> 00:34.452
<i>it's opening week
at the Gravity Falls pool.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:35.793
Gravity Falls pool?

00:35.994 --> 00:37.166
- Today?
- Pun intended?

00:37.371 --> 00:38.793
Quick! To the car!

00:38.997 --> 00:40.670
( Grunting )

00:41.375 --> 00:42.922
Hey, kids, a little help here.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.172
(all grunting )

00:46.421 --> 00:47.172
( shudders )

00:47.756 --> 00:49.349
All right, off to the pool.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.437
<i>And remember to be on alert
for random wildfires.</i>

00:53.679 --> 00:56.023
Wait, what?
( screams )

00:56.557 --> 00:57.353
He'll be fine.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.277
I â™ª

01:38.557 --> 01:40.559
Man: All right,
who wants to do a cannonball?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.485
Man 2: Cannonball!

01:42.686 --> 01:43.938
Ah, the pool.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.698
Sparkling oasis of
summer enchantment.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.993
Yeah, nothing like sitting in
a moist tub with strangers.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.740
It's like the bus, but wet.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.665
Why would a sun
need to wear sunglasses?

01:54.865 --> 01:56.082
It's best not
to think about it.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.082
Whoa, whoa!
Stop the presses!

01:59.536 --> 02:01.254
Who's that?

02:04.124 --> 02:07.094
Oh, yeah. ( chomping ) Word is,
dude never leaves the pool.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.092
People say
he's a "mysterious loner."

02:10.297 --> 02:11.640
( chomping )

02:12.090 --> 02:15.014
Is it getting hot out here,
or is it just that guy?

02:15.218 --> 02:16.595
It's the hottest day
of the year, Mabel.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.806
Besides, can't you go
for one week

02:19.014 --> 02:21.437
without having a new crush
on some random guy?

02:21.642 --> 02:22.859
Uh-Uh. ( gasps )

02:23.101 --> 02:25.069
Look at his
little moustache hairs!

02:25.270 --> 02:28.820
You are clearly enamored.
Go to him.

02:29.149 --> 02:29.945
( laughs )

02:30.150 --> 02:30.946
(groans)

02:31.777 --> 02:33.245
- Hey, come on!
- Watch it, kid!

02:33.445 --> 02:34.196
Aah!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.246
Oqps, sorry!

02:35.447 --> 02:36.539
It's so beautiful!

02:36.740 --> 02:38.959
Eh, Mabel's all talk.
You wanna know a secret?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.752
She's never even
kissed a guy before.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.458
She always
messes it up somehow.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.040
0V, women!

02:44.206 --> 02:45.048
Aah!

02:45.248 --> 02:46.340
Hey, Mr. Pines.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.384
Wendy? Where's the lifeguard?

02:48.585 --> 02:49.802
I
am the lifeguard.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.097
I make the rules, sucka! Boosh!

02:52.422 --> 02:55.016
Aah! She's attacking me
with water!

02:55.217 --> 02:56.560
(all laugh)

02:56.760 --> 02:58.103
Wow. You work here?

02:58.303 --> 03:00.647
I found out lifeguards
get free snack privileges.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.724
Plus, I get the best seat
in the house.

03:02.933 --> 03:03.775
Yeah, you do!

03:03.975 --> 03:06.603
( Iaughil19 )

03:06.812 --> 03:08.155
( whispers )
I've been laughing for too long.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.858
Dude, are you and Wendy
having a secret staring contest?

03:11.066 --> 03:11.737
'Cause I think you're winning--

03:11.942 --> 03:12.909
Soos!Shh!

03:14.528 --> 03:17.247
So, hey, you wanna go chuck more
water balloons at Grunkle Stan?

03:17.447 --> 03:19.791
I'd love to, but I gotta
spend the day doing tryouts.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.664
We're looking for
a new assistant lifeguard.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.371
Hey! ( clears throat )

03:24.579 --> 03:25.205
( deep voice ) Hey...

03:25.414 --> 03:26.506
( normal voice ) What if
I was assistant lifeguard?

03:26.707 --> 03:29.927
That would be so much fun!
You're totally in, dude!

03:30.836 --> 03:33.555
You just have to check in with
my boss first, Mr. Poolcheck.

03:33.755 --> 03:34.597
Your boss?

03:35.674 --> 03:36.926
( Sniffs )

03:37.884 --> 03:42.230
( grunting )

03:43.807 --> 03:44.603

03:48.061 --> 03:49.313
( sighs )

03:50.397 --> 03:51.319
( Qasps )

03:51.523 --> 03:54.652
Wow! Oh, my gosh, how crazy,
bumping into you here,

03:54.901 --> 03:56.619
even though
we don't know each other.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.456
How long have you
been underwater?

03:59.656 --> 04:02.455
That doesn't matter!
( coughing )

04:02.659 --> 04:04.957
So, hey!
My name's Mabel.

04:05.162 --> 04:05.788
Hola.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.044
Whoa! Are you Australian?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.082
( laughs )

04:09.291 --> 04:10.918
I am charmed by
your sense of humor...

04:11.126 --> 04:13.424
And your bold lack
of water wings.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.722
( laughs )
You're so funny!

04:16.005 --> 04:18.259
And your hair is beautiful.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.469
No, no,
it has silly tangles.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.179
Mind if I...
( chuckles )

04:22.596 --> 04:24.940
Why, Mabel,
you are so forward.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.232
( laughs )

04:26.433 --> 04:27.730
<i>This is it!
He likes you!</i>

04:27.934 --> 04:29.402
<i>Go for it, Mabel!
It's time!</i>

04:29.603 --> 04:30.820
<i>Ask him out on a date!</i>

04:31.104 --> 04:34.108
So, hey, you wanna go dry off?
Maybe hit the snack bar or--

04:34.316 --> 04:36.284
I--I'm afraid I cannot.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.619
For I have a terrible secret!

04:40.781 --> 04:41.907
I must go.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.665
I'm upset.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.750
Yet, intrigued.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.508
And that is why I think I'd make
a good lifeguard assistant.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.261
Hmm... ( sniffs)

04:55.587 --> 04:58.841
SPF 100? Good. I like you.

04:59.341 --> 05:02.686
But this isn't an easy job.
It's anarchy out there.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.891
I think I can handle it.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.270
Can you handle this?!

05:08.475 --> 05:09.146
( Qasps )

05:09.351 --> 05:11.979
I lost my hand
to a pool filter!

05:12.646 --> 05:13.772
The pool may seem friendly,

05:13.980 --> 05:15.823
but she can turn on you
in an instant!

05:15.982 --> 05:17.984
Which is why
you must respect her rules!

05:18.193 --> 05:21.242
Do you think you have
what it takes, boy? Do you?!

05:23.657 --> 05:24.909
Sure. I guess.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.126
Welcome to the deep end, son.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.172
Well, thanks. I--

05:31.373 --> 05:32.295
(grunts)

05:32.833 --> 05:34.801
Yep, oh,
this is happening.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.591
There she is, Soos.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.261
Equidistant from the snack bar
and the bathroom,

05:40.465 --> 05:42.888
just the right amount
of sun and shade.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.188
And pointed away from where
Old Man McGucket lotions himself.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.605
<i>Whoa-wee!</i>

05:47.806 --> 05:49.479
( cackling )

05:49.683 --> 05:51.685
The perfect lawn chair.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.527
The legends that you told me
in the car were true.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.573
I just can't believe
it wasn't already taken!

05:57.774 --> 06:01.028
And now to sit on it,
thereby claiming it as my own.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.032
(grunts)

06:02.237 --> 06:03.534
What?!

06:03.947 --> 06:05.369
Why, hello, Stanford.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.999
Gideon!
Get out of my chair, kid!

06:09.202 --> 06:13.002
Oh, my, was this your chair?
I had no idea.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.504
( Whispers )
Yes, I did, Stan. I knew.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.465
Mm! Ooh!

06:17.669 --> 06:18.841
Move it,
you little troll!

06:19.129 --> 06:20.927
First come, first serve!

06:21.131 --> 06:23.634
(laughs) Mm! Ooh! Ooh!

06:23.842 --> 06:25.936
I'll first serve you!

06:26.344 --> 06:27.641
-( Whistle blows )
- Huh?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.098
Come on, Wendy!

06:30.307 --> 06:31.934
You can't do this
to an old man!

06:32.142 --> 06:33.519
Sorry, Stan. It's not up to me.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.024
( Chuckles ) Actually, it is.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.696
Hey, Wendy! I got the job!

06:36.897 --> 06:38.945
Sweet!
Wanna go abuse our power?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.401
But what if Poolcheck
catches us?

06:40.609 --> 06:42.361
He seems emotionally unstable.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.284
( Cracking )

06:45.488 --> 06:46.990
Hmm...

06:47.198 --> 06:48.074
( cracking )

06:48.283 --> 06:49.375
Nah, don't worry, man.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.294
You just gotta be sneaky
about your rule-breaking.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.041
Race you
to the "no running" sign!

06:53.246 --> 06:54.463
( laughs )

06:55.916 --> 06:56.633
( slurps )

07:02.339 --> 07:03.386
How long you in for?

07:03.590 --> 07:04.637
Two hours, for roughhousing.

07:04.841 --> 07:05.763
But I'm innocent!

07:05.967 --> 07:07.184
Pool jail ain't so bad...

07:07.385 --> 07:09.638
As long as you don't
wind up in solitary.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.104
It's the nights
that are the hardest.

07:22.943 --> 07:23.865
"Hey, there!
_( gasps )

07:24.069 --> 07:25.070
I brought you a sandwich.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.656
It's sort of wet,
but it's still good. Blop.

07:27.864 --> 07:31.038
I like sharing things--
sandwiches, secrets...

07:31.242 --> 07:33.119
( whispers ) Share your secret,
beautiful stranger.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.831
That wet sandwich
does look delicious.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.628
Oh, very well.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.177
But you must never tell another
living soul my terrible secret.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.139
You have to stay away from me
because I am...

07:45.382 --> 07:46.975
A merman.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.896
( Chuckles ) Oh, thank goodness.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.686
I thought you were gonna
say you had a girlfriend.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.855
A merman! Ha!

07:57.060 --> 08:00.030
I should have known from your
strange foreign fish language.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.485
It is Spanish.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.489
Your voice is so deep
and masculine. How old are you?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.821
I am 12 years old.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.905
Mermens' voices change
when we are, like, three.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.582
So what's your name?

08:10.782 --> 08:12.079
There are some who call me...

08:12.283 --> 08:13.660
I â™ª

08:13.868 --> 08:15.040
Mermando.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.622
This is because
Mermando is my name.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.298
But I don't understand,
Mermando.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.717
What's a guy like you
doing in a public pool?

08:20.959 --> 08:22.802
It is a tragic story, Mabel.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.217
<i>I was swimming with my friends,
the mighty dolphins,</i>

08:25.422 --> 08:28.141
<i>in the Gulf of Mexico,
when I was ensnared!</i>

08:28.925 --> 08:30.973
Earl, did we just
catch ourselves

08:31.177 --> 08:33.429
some kind of
beautiful man-fish?

08:33.722 --> 08:35.645
Let's feast on his flesh!

08:35.849 --> 08:37.897
<i>The cargo was headed
for Gravity Falls.</i>

08:38.101 --> 08:38.772
(grunts)

08:39.436 --> 08:42.530
<i>Using all my strength,
I tried to escape back home,</i>

08:42.897 --> 08:43.989
<i>but it was not to be.</i>

08:44.190 --> 08:44.941
Ha-ha!

08:45.150 --> 08:45.901
(groans)

08:49.070 --> 08:50.663
<i>I would have died
of dehydration,</i>

08:50.864 --> 08:53.242
<i>were it not for the kindness
of the forest animals.</i>

08:53.450 --> 08:56.579
( laughil19 )

08:56.786 --> 08:58.504
Continue licking! Oh!

08:58.705 --> 09:00.878
( Groaning )

09:01.041 --> 09:01.917
( Qasps )

09:03.793 --> 09:05.295
But now that
you know what I am,

09:05.503 --> 09:07.676
you must be
seriously weirded out.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.475
What?! I don't care
that you're a merman!

09:10.675 --> 09:13.349
You're, like, the coolest guy
I've ever met.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.772
And you can play at least
one chord on the guitar.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.809
Oh, Mabel. I have never met
another human like you.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.861
Would you care to join me
in a game of the Marco Polo?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.406
Oh, yes, Mermando! Yes!

09:25.065 --> 09:27.284
You're covering my gills.
I cannot breathe.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.736
( Coughing and wheezing )

09:28.943 --> 09:30.945
( chuckles ) Weird.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.992
Ooh! ( giggles )
My cheeks are baby soft!

09:36.785 --> 09:40.039
( Growls ) Look at him,
that smug chair-stealing jerk!

09:40.246 --> 09:43.591
But I can't touch him, or the pool
patrol will throw me in pool jail.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.918
Hmm...

09:45.794 --> 09:46.716
Ah!

09:46.920 --> 09:50.515
( Chuckles ) Yes. Yes!
Burn the child!

09:52.342 --> 09:53.514
Aah! My eyes!

09:54.469 --> 09:55.812
Deal with it.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.439
( Growls )

09:59.432 --> 10:00.433
Soos.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.690
Inflatable duck guy?
Is that you?

10:02.894 --> 10:04.521
Yes, Soos. I can talk.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.824
Oh, my gosh, I knew you guys
were secretly alive. I knew it!

10:07.982 --> 10:09.074
( Both laugh )

10:09.275 --> 10:11.073
- Shh! Shh!
- Shh! Shh!

10:11.319 --> 10:14.869
My people have been enslaved,
Soos. You must free us.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.576
The inflatable pool duck
revolution is at hand.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.584
( Both laugh )

10:18.785 --> 10:19.877
( whistle blows )

10:20.078 --> 10:22.206
Pool's closing!
Clear out, everyone!

10:22.413 --> 10:23.710
- Poolcheck!
- Hide!

10:24.290 --> 10:25.917
Out! Do not touch!

10:26.126 --> 10:27.548
Assistant lifeguard!

10:29.295 --> 10:32.515
Have a good night, son.
Lock up the supplies for me.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.138
( Both chuckling )

10:38.346 --> 10:39.017
( whistle blows )

10:39.222 --> 10:40.769
The pool, she closes.

10:40.974 --> 10:41.770
Can I see you tonight?

10:41.975 --> 10:44.194
Sure. Where?
Wanna go for a walk?

10:44.602 --> 10:46.320
Merman. I am a merman.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.274
Oh, right.
Then I'll be back tonight.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.158
( Grunting )

11:02.954 --> 11:05.252
Look, here's a scrapbook
of human stuff.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.299
Here's me
standing with my legs,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.673
and here I am
kicking Dipper in his legs.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.721
He couldn't move his legs
after that.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.265
Can you imagine,
not having legs!

11:14.507 --> 11:15.508
Let's skip this part.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.936
And here's my whole family
kickboxing!

11:18.386 --> 11:19.387
( Sighs )

11:22.265 --> 11:23.016
What's wrong?

11:24.851 --> 11:25.693
I â™ª

11:26.144 --> 11:26.815
(grunts)

11:27.312 --> 11:29.110
I, too, used to have
a family once,

11:29.314 --> 11:30.440
back in the ocean.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.614
How I miss them.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.286
Mermando, why don't you
just leave the pool?

11:38.489 --> 11:39.536
I tried only once.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.664
But escaping this pool
required a plan

11:41.659 --> 11:43.411
that was bold and daring.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.792
I â™ª

11:49.000 --> 11:52.254
( Groaning )

11:52.879 --> 11:56.929
( screaming )

11:57.175 --> 11:58.097
(groans)

11:58.760 --> 12:00.603
And then the wolves came.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.815
No, I am glad that I am here,
because I met you.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.059
<i>This is it, Mabel.</i>

12:06.267 --> 12:07.814
<i>First kiss moment,
here we come.</i>

12:08.019 --> 12:08.895
<i>Just go for it!</i>

12:09.103 --> 12:10.229
Mm!!!

12:10.939 --> 12:12.065
What are you doing
with your mouth?

12:12.273 --> 12:15.493
Me? Nothing! This? I was
just eating some sour candy.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.071
So my lips were doing that
'cause the candy was so sour.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.157
Can I have some candy?

12:21.491 --> 12:22.117
No.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.298
( Sputters )
What the--

12:28.539 --> 12:31.133
- I'm scared!
- Me, too!

12:31.417 --> 12:32.543
One hundred points!

12:32.752 --> 12:33.753
Dude, with this job,

12:33.962 --> 12:36.010
you and me are gonna be
having fun all summer!

12:36.256 --> 12:37.257
All summer?

12:37.674 --> 12:38.425
-( Whistle blows )
-( both gasp )

12:38.633 --> 12:40.556
Pines, here, now!

12:41.844 --> 12:46.816
You gave me your word that you would
respect the sacred rules of this municipal pool!

12:47.016 --> 12:48.814
Mr. Poolcheck,
are you crying?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.565
That's not important
right now! ( sniffs )

12:50.770 --> 12:53.398
You are on thin ice, boy.
You wanna keep this job?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.655
Well, some maniac broke into
the supply closet last night

12:56.859 --> 12:59.112
and destroyed our one
and only pool skimmer!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.617
I want you on a stakeout.

13:00.822 --> 13:04.417
If one more supply gets taken,
you're fired!

13:04.826 --> 13:06.203
I won't let you down!

13:06.411 --> 13:09.506
Mermando, get ready!
I'm gonna bring the heat!

13:09.872 --> 13:10.919
Boosh!

13:11.916 --> 13:13.793
Mermando, are you okay?

13:14.419 --> 13:18.469
Oh, it's your family, isn't it?
Are you thinking about them?

13:18.673 --> 13:19.549
( Dolphin cry)

13:20.091 --> 13:22.139
Mermando, enough is enough!

13:22.385 --> 13:25.184
I care about you too much
to see you like this.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.733
We're gonna bust you out of here
and get you back to your family.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.686
But, Mabel,
escape is impossible!

13:31.894 --> 13:34.397
We're breaking you
out of here tonight!

13:35.231 --> 13:37.700
Whoops! Sorry about that.
Water.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.372
All right, Dipper,
here's the plan.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.450
Catch the trespasser,
protect the supplies,

13:45.658 --> 13:47.877
keep job at pool,
and eventually marry Wendy.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.086
Freeze!

13:49.787 --> 13:50.629
Grunkle Stan?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.503
I, uh, I'm sleepwalking.

13:52.707 --> 13:53.833
Also, now I'm sleep-talking.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.134
Nice hat, by the way.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.004
You! You're the one
destroying pool supplies!

13:58.296 --> 14:00.845
What? No! My crime
is a lot better than that.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.016
I'm gonna get that seat,

14:02.216 --> 14:04.059
and be ready in the morning
when Gideon comes.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.013
Then maybe I'll destroy some
pool supplies. Night's still young.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.598
( Blows whistle )

14:08.806 --> 14:11.685
Sheesh, all right,
I'm going! (grunts)

14:11.893 --> 14:12.644
Hey!

14:13.144 --> 14:15.192
( Beeping )

14:15.688 --> 14:16.610
Mabel!

14:19.817 --> 14:21.569
Are you ready
to see your family?

14:21.778 --> 14:24.873
Yes, but how can I, a merman,
possibly escape?

14:25.073 --> 14:28.327
Okay, my original plan was to
tape together a bunch of fish sticks

14:28.534 --> 14:31.162
to make you a prosthetic
pair of people legs.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.455
Intriguing.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.132
But then I realized I could just
transport you in this cooler.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.171
Ha-ha!

14:36.459 --> 14:42.057
( Grunting )

14:44.133 --> 14:45.259
Dipper: Hey! Who's there!

14:46.511 --> 14:49.060
Quick! Hide me!
My kind must not be seen!

14:49.263 --> 14:52.107
Mabel? Is there anyone not
breaking into the pool tonight?

14:52.308 --> 14:53.730
What, is Soos here too?

14:54.143 --> 14:55.110
( Grunts ) I'm okay.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.028
Go home, Soos.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.152
You got it.
( grunting )

14:58.356 --> 14:59.824
So, why are you here?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.575
Uh, no reason.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.572
( Clears throat )

15:02.902 --> 15:04.700
Did that cooler
just clear its throat?

15:04.904 --> 15:08.454
Don't be silly. There certainly isn't a merman
in there, if that's what you're implying.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.376
Who said
anything about a merman?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.919
Mabel, I don't have
time for your games.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.964
If you don't give me those supplies,
I'll lose the coolest job ever!

15:15.164 --> 15:17.462
( Sighs ) I understand.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.427
Hey, look!
Wendy in a bikini!

15:19.627 --> 15:20.503
Really? At night?

15:20.711 --> 15:21.883
Sorry, Dipper!

15:23.005 --> 15:23.881
Mabel!

15:28.177 --> 15:29.554
Go, Mabel, go!

15:29.846 --> 15:31.598
We can't all be saved.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.275
( Champs )

15:35.810 --> 15:37.357
I'm gonna get you home!

15:38.438 --> 15:41.282
Hand over the pool supplies
in the name of pool law!

15:41.607 --> 15:44.577
Pool law is dumb!
And so is your hat!

15:45.403 --> 15:46.746
(grunts)

15:49.532 --> 15:51.159
Look! Gravity Falls Lake!

15:55.746 --> 15:57.043
The coast is clear.

15:58.958 --> 15:59.675
Ahh.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.719
Now all I have to do
is wait here 15 hours

16:01.919 --> 16:03.592
until the pool opens.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.467
This was a good plan.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.269
( Snorts )
I think someone just sped by.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.147
Probably just a dream.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.275
With you,
every day is a dream.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.481
(grunts)

16:23.524 --> 16:25.367
( gasping ) I cannot breathe!

16:25.651 --> 16:26.573
You must hurry!

16:32.074 --> 16:33.997
( Tires screech )

16:34.202 --> 16:35.499
<i>_ Aah'
_ Aah'</i>

16:35.661 --> 16:36.878
-( tires screech )
-( grunts )

16:37.455 --> 16:38.081
I'm okay.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.291
All right, the jig is up!
Hand over that cooler!

16:40.500 --> 16:41.171
Never!

16:41.375 --> 16:43.298
Why not?
Why do you even need it?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.721
I needed the cooler
to save my new friend

16:45.922 --> 16:47.799
because he needs to go home
and he's really nice

16:48.007 --> 16:49.099
and we combed
each others' hair

16:49.300 --> 16:50.973
and he needs to be in the cooler
because he breathes water

16:51.177 --> 16:52.645
because he's a merman!

16:55.097 --> 16:56.098
Hola.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.185
Whoa! Way to bury
the lead, Mabel.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.655
Dipper, Mermando the merman.
He's a merman.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.358
Nice to meet you!
Also, I think I am dying.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.034
( Gasps ) water!

17:07.234 --> 17:10.329
( Gasps ) Agua!
( coughs ) Yo necesito!

17:10.738 --> 17:11.454
( Qasps )

17:11.656 --> 17:12.873
Oh, no! Mermando!

17:13.074 --> 17:15.497
Dipper, you're a lifeguard!
Give him CPR!

17:15.701 --> 17:16.953
Mermen don't breathe air!

17:17.161 --> 17:19.960
Then give him
reverse CPR! Doi!

17:20.164 --> 17:21.086
( Pants )

17:23.917 --> 17:27.593
(gurgling )

17:27.797 --> 17:28.423
I hate this!

17:28.631 --> 17:30.133
(gurgling )

17:30.341 --> 17:31.092
I hate this!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.847
(gurgling )

17:33.719 --> 17:34.390
( camera shutter snaps )

17:34.679 --> 17:36.147
( laughs ) Blackmail!

17:36.347 --> 17:37.815
( Qasps )

17:38.599 --> 17:39.350
Thank you for saving me,

17:39.559 --> 17:42.062
but why didn't you just
roll me into the lake?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.611
(groans)

17:47.984 --> 17:48.701
( both grunt )

17:50.152 --> 17:51.324
( dolphin cry)

17:51.529 --> 17:52.451
( coughs )

17:52.655 --> 17:53.872
I am weak from coughing.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.620
How will I get my family
to hear my call

17:55.825 --> 17:57.293
from the mighty depths
of the ocean?

17:57.577 --> 17:58.829
I've got it. B.R.B.

18:00.705 --> 18:01.957
Problem solved!

18:02.164 --> 18:04.292
Mabel, those are pool supplies.
I'll get fired!

18:04.500 --> 18:08.801
Dipper! Don't you know what
it's like to fall for someone,

18:09.005 --> 18:12.134
even though you know in your heart
that it'll probably never work out?

18:12.383 --> 18:14.681
But you'd do anything
for that person?

18:17.930 --> 18:18.601
( Sighs )

18:18.806 --> 18:19.932
Give Mermando
the megaphone.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.188
Thanks, Dip.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.737
Mabel, I have never
met anyone like you.

18:24.937 --> 18:25.904
Same here.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.608
Except for a zombie, a gnome,
and a couple of cute vampires.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.942
I don't remember
the vampires.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.819
I don't tell you everything.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.656
Well, Mermando,
I guess this is it.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.866
Not quite. This is!

18:40.328 --> 18:42.547
Whoa! Okay, that's gross. Ugh.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.671
( Cheers )

18:45.875 --> 18:47.422
That was my first kiss!

18:47.627 --> 18:50.176
Hey, it was also kind of
your first kiss too, huh? Huh?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.381
( Shudders ) Please
don't involve me in this.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.676
Goodbye, Mermando.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.976
Goodbye, Mabel.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.390
You did the right thing,
Dipper.

19:00.765 --> 19:01.857
Yeah, yeah.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.108
Oh, wait, wait!
One last thing!

19:08.689 --> 19:09.736
Yes!

19:11.400 --> 19:13.073
I've always wanted to do that.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.740
A wrecked fence,
dents in the pool mobile,

19:16.947 --> 19:18.620
and a missing megaphone?

19:19.450 --> 19:21.248
Who is responsible for this?!

19:22.828 --> 19:26.002
It's my fault, sir.
I'm sorry. I got in too deep.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.339
Hand over the whistle, boy!

19:30.795 --> 19:32.923
( Grunting )

19:33.839 --> 19:39.721
( chomping )

19:39.929 --> 19:40.646
( whistle blows )

19:40.846 --> 19:43.440
If one more thing
goes wrong today...

19:43.683 --> 19:44.309
( grunting )

19:44.517 --> 19:45.814
You're free now! Free!

19:46.519 --> 19:48.112
Inflatable ducks unite!

19:48.354 --> 19:49.150
You!

19:49.397 --> 19:51.024
Huh? Aah!

19:51.190 --> 19:52.066
(grunts)

19:52.274 --> 19:54.026
( screaming )

19:54.402 --> 19:55.904
Git 'em! Git 'em!

19:57.113 --> 19:57.909
(groans)

19:58.406 --> 20:00.158
Hey, doofus, you'll never
guess what happened.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.159
I just got fired.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.952
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.413
I guess Poolcheck found out
I was taking too many snacks.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.372
How many?

20:06.997 --> 20:07.748
( laughs )

20:07.957 --> 20:09.209
Hey, wanna go break rules
somewhere else?

20:09.417 --> 20:10.259
Of course!

20:10.459 --> 20:12.006
( Both laugh )

20:14.797 --> 20:15.639
( sighs )

20:16.841 --> 20:17.717
Huh?

20:21.429 --> 20:23.682
"Dear Mabel,
I am home with my family,

20:23.889 --> 20:25.482
and I am very happy..."

20:25.683 --> 20:27.981
Mermando: <i>Our first kiss will always
hold a place in my heart.</i>

20:28.436 --> 20:29.358
<i>Technically hearts...</i>

20:29.562 --> 20:31.940
<i>As a merman I have,
like, 17 hearts.</i>

20:32.481 --> 20:33.653
<i>Horrifying but true!</i>

20:33.899 --> 20:35.151
<i>More bottles on the way!</i>

20:37.027 --> 20:37.903
( laughs )

20:39.363 --> 20:40.159
Stanford!

20:40.364 --> 20:41.581
( laughs )

20:41.949 --> 20:44.498
Well, guess you've won.
Put 'er there.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.246
( Grunting ) Hey! What the--

20:47.455 --> 20:49.378
Unless perhaps
I predicted your plan,

20:49.582 --> 20:52.256
and coated the entire chair
with glue last night!

20:52.460 --> 20:55.384
Enjoy your chair...
( whispers ) forever.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.052
( laughs )

20:58.340 --> 20:59.967
(grunts)

21:00.176 --> 21:03.601
Kids, get the spatulas! Kids!

21:03.804 --> 21:06.478
I â™ª

21:20.863 --> 21:24.242
( Birds chirping )

21:24.450 --> 21:26.498
( fireworks exploding )
