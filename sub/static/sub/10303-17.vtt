<i>Today on Oprah:</i>

01:18.020 --> 01:22.855
<i>Qualified experts speak rationally
about relevant social issues.</i>

01:23.060 --> 01:24.254
What?

01:24.460 --> 01:26.576
<i>Just kidding. Today's topic:</i>

01:26.780 --> 01:29.817
<i>Sluts who hang out at 7-Eleven.</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:35.820
Congratulations, Peggy.

01:40.980 --> 01:43.574
Happy 25th wedding anniversary.

01:43.780 --> 01:44.974
How do you do it?

01:45.300 --> 01:46.528
Well, I don't.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.968
Well...

01:48.260 --> 01:51.536
...I do,
but only after Al goes to sleep.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.579
To tell the truth, Marcy...

01:53.820 --> 01:56.414
...I don't think Al knows
that today is our anniversary.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.333
Well, I hope you're not planning
anything special for him.

02:00.540 --> 02:01.768
Of course I am.

02:02.020 --> 02:05.729
I'm getting him the sweat socks that
Michael Jordan wore in his last game...

02:05.940 --> 02:09.615
...signed and unwashed, for $500.

02:10.979 --> 02:12.811
Now why would you go
to all that trouble...

02:13.020 --> 02:14.772
...when you know
he's not getting you anything?

02:15.020 --> 02:17.978
Because then I will own him.

02:19.020 --> 02:22.330
I will have something to lord over him
for the rest of his...

02:22.540 --> 02:27.694
...hunched-over, minimum wage-earning,
fat lady-pleasing, shoe-selling life.

02:33.580 --> 02:38.529
Well, at least you are going to get one
great anniversary present because...

02:38.900 --> 02:43.451
...I am taking you to one of Chicago's
finest massage and beauty spas.

02:43.660 --> 02:46.572
Antoine's Under the EI.

02:47.780 --> 02:51.693
I bought the all-day
soak and poke package.

02:55.340 --> 02:56.932
A massage?

02:57.140 --> 02:58.334
Well, I don't know, Marcy.

02:58.540 --> 03:01.896
You know, I'm not comfortable taking
my clothes off for total strangers.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.539
They'll be men.

03:05.740 --> 03:07.093
What are we waiting for?

03:26.340 --> 03:28.376
Oh, it took forever for them to leave.

03:28.620 --> 03:32.090
Yeah, but much like a 'roid,
they come back with a vengeance.

03:34.700 --> 03:38.693
That's one thing I learned
from my first 800 years of marriage.

03:39.660 --> 03:42.538
Well, where'd you hide Peggy's gift?

03:42.740 --> 03:45.334
In a place she'd never think to look.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.855
Diamond necklace.

03:58.700 --> 04:02.693
All part of my master plan
to avoid having sex with the wife.

04:03.620 --> 04:06.180
See, first I take her to Denny's.

04:07.980 --> 04:10.540
She stuffs herself
so full of popcorn shrimp...

04:10.740 --> 04:12.935
...she lists to one side.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.694
And just before she's ready to belch,
"I love you"...

04:16.899 --> 04:18.379
...I lay this on her.

04:18.579 --> 04:21.572
Between the combination of shrimp,
necklace...

04:21.779 --> 04:25.739
...and the NyQuil Mickey
I'll be slipping in her piña colada...

04:26.300 --> 04:27.733
...she'll be unconscious...

04:27.980 --> 04:30.619
...I'll be home
watching midget wrestling...

04:31.020 --> 04:34.490
...and the only hand down my pants
will be my own.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.974
Dad, I got a problem.

04:53.180 --> 04:56.331
We were out walking Buck
when we ran into old Mrs. Stewart.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.576
And she was wearing her
yellow rain slicker...

04:58.780 --> 05:02.011
...and I guess Buck must have thought
she was a fire hydrant.

05:03.580 --> 05:06.219
So, in a butt-shell...

05:07.060 --> 05:09.733
...here is your cleaning bill
and a court date.

05:10.980 --> 05:13.892
Daddy, what's wrong with Buck?

05:14.100 --> 05:16.409
Well, now, kids, come here.

05:17.140 --> 05:20.894
I never thought I'd be having
this conversation, because frankly...

05:21.100 --> 05:24.251
...I didn't think
I'd still be alive on this...

05:24.460 --> 05:27.418
...my 40,000th anniversary.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.811
But it's time we all faced facts.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.651
Buck's getting old.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.811
Is he gonna die?

05:35.380 --> 05:36.893
Yes.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.494
Go play.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.619
What?

05:43.820 --> 05:45.538
Kelly...

05:45.780 --> 05:49.898
...what Father Teresa
is trying to say...

05:50.100 --> 05:52.170
...is that just because
Buck is getting old...

05:52.380 --> 05:54.496
...it doesn't mean
he's gonna die immediately.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.975
The important thing
is that you just treat him...

05:57.180 --> 05:59.774
...like any other member of the family
when they get old and senile.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.250
Oh, you mean steal their food
and mix up their medicine.

06:09.740 --> 06:11.856
I don't want Buck to get old and senile.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.695
Pumpkin, sweetheart, let me explain
the aging process to you.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.016
I, too, was a young man.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.653
Oh, no.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.734
Young enough to score four touchdowns
in a single game.

06:27.180 --> 06:32.254
Then darkness cast
her giant red shadow over the land.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.693
It was...

06:34.940 --> 06:37.215
...the wife age.

06:38.020 --> 06:40.409
<i>And he thinks I'm getting old.</i>

06:41.300 --> 06:43.370
I never wanted children.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.775
I wanted to just
work on car engines...

06:45.980 --> 06:49.017
...and make kissing sounds
when women walked by me.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.333
The wife never shared my dream.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.048
<i>I've got to prove to him
that I'm not senile.</i>

06:55.260 --> 06:57.296
<i>I know. I'll bury a bone.</i>

06:57.500 --> 06:59.058
<i>That'll show him.</i>

06:59.260 --> 07:02.252
<i>Now if I can just find a bone.</i>

07:06.180 --> 07:08.819
<i>Oh, excuse me, madam.</i>

07:10.900 --> 07:12.618
<i>There's a bone.</i>

07:14.700 --> 07:17.817
<i>Now to take it to the back yard.</i>

07:19.940 --> 07:22.534
<i>Will you stop following me?</i>

07:24.500 --> 07:26.570
Twenty-five years?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.213
How can that be?

07:28.420 --> 07:31.332
I was just in high school.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.370
Why? I didn't do anything wrong.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.976
So this is how women
who didn't marry shoe salesmen live.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.892
And it only gets better.

07:45.140 --> 07:49.930
We're starting with the Tibetan
sensuous massage with cactus fronds.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.856
Is that good for you?

07:53.420 --> 07:54.694
Oh, it's great.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.017
It takes off the first four layers
of dead skin.

07:58.860 --> 08:00.532
Well, what if your skin isn't dead?

08:00.860 --> 08:02.657
It will be.

08:03.740 --> 08:05.571
Mrs. D'Arcy.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.494
- How lovely to see you again.
- Oh, Sven.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.850
This is Peggy.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.850
Peggy, Sven is mine.

08:21.340 --> 08:23.456
Chance, your masseur,
will be with you shortly.

08:23.700 --> 08:27.739
Mrs. D'Arcy,
are you prepared to be pricked?

08:31.460 --> 08:33.212
Am I.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.732
Oh, Chance?

08:36.980 --> 08:40.177
No, I'm Dave. I'm straight.
And I run the gift shop.

08:40.940 --> 08:45.377
Hi. I'm Peggy. I'm celibate
and it's my 25th wedding anniversary.

08:45.820 --> 08:47.378
Anniversary? No.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.616
I would have thought
it was your 25th birthday.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.137
I'll take five.

08:54.580 --> 08:55.899
I haven't shown you anything yet.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.615
Oh, yes, you have.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.568
Well, then, why don't
we just step into my office.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.896
Well, I guess I could do that
for a minute.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.931
I'm waiting for my cactus treatment.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.573
Oh, Peggy...

09:07.820 --> 09:09.697
...now, I may be way out of line here...

09:09.900 --> 09:12.812
...but I feel that your skin
is much too delicate...

09:13.020 --> 09:15.454
...to be subjected
to the cactus smacking.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.696
Now, I have a toner here...

09:17.900 --> 09:20.619
...than can produce that same rosy glow
without the pain.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.970
And it's only $50.

09:23.220 --> 09:25.780
Mrs. Bundy, I'm Chance.
Your masseur.

09:25.980 --> 09:29.450
Are you ready to join your friends
in pleasure?

09:36.020 --> 09:37.738
Hold your fronds, Chance.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.660
Only $50, you say?

09:42.540 --> 09:46.215
You're a bad boy.
Bad boy.

09:46.540 --> 09:49.418
Buck, don't you know you're not
supposed to track mud into the house?

09:49.660 --> 09:50.775
<i>No problem.</i>

09:50.980 --> 09:54.814
<i>Next time I'll just fly around the room
until my paws dry on their own.</i>

10:10.220 --> 10:11.619
Kids...

10:11.820 --> 10:14.937
...look what Daddy rented for $8.

10:20.740 --> 10:23.891
Did it come with the matching
Urkel glasses?

10:25.420 --> 10:27.251
Laugh all you want.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.337
Shut up.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.373
Now...

10:31.580 --> 10:33.138
...with the money I saved...

10:33.340 --> 10:35.808
...I was able to buy your mother...

10:36.740 --> 10:37.968
...this.

10:42.980 --> 10:44.459
A hairy Abba-Zaba?

10:47.340 --> 10:48.739
All right, kids.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.658
Where's your mother's necklace?

10:50.860 --> 10:52.691
We don't know, Dad.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.460
I had it in a white box
with a red ribbon around it.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.019
<i>Odd.</i>

10:57.220 --> 11:00.895
<i>I buried a white bone
with a red ribbon around it.</i>

11:01.540 --> 11:03.770
I put it right there
under that cushion.

11:06.340 --> 11:09.173
<i>This won't look good
on the old résumé.</i>

11:09.540 --> 11:13.579
<i>Okay, I'll just go dig it up
and put it back where I got it.</i>

11:13.780 --> 11:15.691
<i>How easy is that?</i>

11:16.860 --> 11:18.691
<i>What am I looking for?</i>

11:24.180 --> 11:26.011
<i>Pardon me, sir.</i>

11:26.780 --> 11:28.736
All right,
let me explain something to you kids.

11:29.220 --> 11:32.098
If I don't get that necklace,
then I can't give it to your mother.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.018
If I can't give it to your mother...

11:34.220 --> 11:36.893
...then I have to give it
to your mother.

11:39.460 --> 11:42.133
And if I have to give it
to your mother...

11:42.340 --> 11:44.535
...I'm going to give it to you.

11:45.860 --> 11:49.296
<i>Well, another mystery solved.</i>

11:50.140 --> 11:53.177
<i>I think someone owes someone else
an apology.</i>

11:53.500 --> 11:54.853
Wait a sec, Dad.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.295
Is that the ribbon from the box?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.819
Well, that's the ribbon.

11:59.020 --> 12:00.612
But the necklace is still gone.

12:01.460 --> 12:04.213
<i>I'm going invisible now.</i>

12:05.740 --> 12:08.015
<i>There. I'm invisible.</i>

12:16.340 --> 12:18.979
<i>Damn ribbon gave me away.</i>

12:23.900 --> 12:25.970
- Dirt-eating mutt.
- Buck, you gotta find it.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.330
- I knew you were a bag of bones.
- Find it.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.373
<i>Whoa, people, one at a time.</i>

12:31.980 --> 12:35.529
You moron, fleabag,
pitiful excuse for a dog.

12:35.740 --> 12:37.776
Where is that necklace?

12:37.980 --> 12:41.017
- I don't think he's gonna tell us, Dad.
- Why not?

12:41.340 --> 12:42.932
He's a dog.

12:43.660 --> 12:47.255
Oh, Buck, come on.
Find the necklace, boy.

12:47.500 --> 12:51.732
This is going nowhere. I look in his
eyes, all I see the other side of the yard.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.329
We're just gonna have to
start digging.

12:55.780 --> 12:57.816
Dad, he's not even dead yet.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.895
For the necklace,
you cartoon character.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.818
Okay, let's see what we've got.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.580
The Margaret Chow chin wrap...

13:11.260 --> 13:14.570
...the Rosewood paddle fanny toner...

13:15.100 --> 13:18.331
...and the Tommy Lee Jones
crater spackle.

13:19.820 --> 13:22.095
Which comes to $300.

13:22.700 --> 13:23.928
But for you, Peggy...

13:24.180 --> 13:26.250
...I'm going to take off 15 percent.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.337
Then add 15 for gratuity...

13:28.540 --> 13:30.417
...which brings us to--

13:30.620 --> 13:32.690
Let's just round this off to $300.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.852
How do you people
make any money?

13:37.060 --> 13:39.130
Mrs. Bundy, it's getting late.

13:39.340 --> 13:43.128
It's time for your Mexican pepper facial
and spine pull.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.735
Very refreshing.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.011
Hey, look. Here's 5 bucks.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.613
Go get yourself some pogs.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.328
Gee, thanks, Mrs. Bundy.

13:56.860 --> 13:59.135
All right, Dave, show me more.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.577
What's in that bag?

14:01.820 --> 14:03.253
Oh, that's just my lun--

14:03.460 --> 14:06.133
New line of cosmetics.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.137
Oh, but it's only for celebrities.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.938
What's your favorite TV show?

14:10.140 --> 14:11.653
<i>Oprah.</i>

14:11.860 --> 14:14.294
What a coincidence.
Oprah uses this line.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.491
Oh, please, I must have that.

14:17.740 --> 14:19.492
Oh, and so you shall.

14:24.820 --> 14:28.449
Stupid, useless,
meat by-product of a dog.

14:29.260 --> 14:32.616
You think he could at least be decent
enough to help the people who love him.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.458
Daddy, don't be mad at him.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.493
I mean, I'm sure he feels bad
in his own sort of way.

14:48.700 --> 14:52.409
<i>Buck, come into the light.</i>

14:55.620 --> 14:57.292
<i>Daddy?</i>

15:02.580 --> 15:06.175
- Hey, hey, I think I hit something.
- That's my foot.

15:07.780 --> 15:09.657
No, not that.

15:11.420 --> 15:12.853
This.

15:13.220 --> 15:14.573
What is it?

15:14.780 --> 15:18.853
It's either the fruitcake that Grandma
Wanker gave us last Christmas...

15:19.060 --> 15:22.211
...or it's the black box
from my wedding night.

15:23.620 --> 15:24.894
How pathetic...

15:25.100 --> 15:28.172
...a grown man burying things
in the back yard.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.133
Bud?

15:46.340 --> 15:48.410
Bad dog.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.772
- Bad, bad dog.
- All right now, kids.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.096
Now, can we focus on my shame?

15:54.300 --> 15:56.291
We've got to find this necklace.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.736
Come on, Buck,
you know where it is.

15:58.940 --> 16:00.658
Just show us what you got, boy.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.980
<i>Buck, come into the light.</i>

16:15.180 --> 16:18.252
<i>It's all goodness and love.</i>

16:20.060 --> 16:21.573
<i>Mommy?</i>

16:26.420 --> 16:28.615
Plum essence eye toner...

16:28.820 --> 16:32.699
...the albacore and mayonnaise
pore rejuvenator...

16:33.300 --> 16:36.656
...and the Famous Amos facial disk.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.852
She's done.

16:41.740 --> 16:44.015
I feel so wonderful.

16:44.820 --> 16:46.492
So relaxed.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.850
So paralyzed.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.614
You look 20 years younger.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.697
Then I'll live with it.

16:55.380 --> 17:00.056
Peggy, I can't lift my head any higher,
but I'm sure you look fabulous.

17:00.260 --> 17:01.534
You certainly smell good.

17:01.780 --> 17:05.375
Oh, yeah. That must be my
Baby Ruth body balm.

17:06.060 --> 17:07.492
Shall we go get Al's present?

17:07.859 --> 17:10.818
Can't. I spent all his money
on stuff for me.

17:11.020 --> 17:12.657
But it's no big deal.

17:12.859 --> 17:14.930
Maybe if I don't mention it,
he won't either.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.733
- Let's go get dressed.
- By the by, Sven.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.976
Will I be able to walk again?

17:20.180 --> 17:23.775
When you look this beautiful,
the world will come to you.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.778
Am I smiling?
I can't feel my face.

17:36.860 --> 17:38.373
Look, Dad.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.536
Dad, we've been digging for hours.

17:40.780 --> 17:42.418
I don't think we're gonna find
the necklace.

17:42.780 --> 17:45.374
No problem.
I've still got two plans.

17:45.580 --> 17:50.859
Plan A, I drive to a jewelry store,
steal a necklace, shoot my way out...

17:51.140 --> 17:53.973
...and get back here
before your mom gets home.

17:56.460 --> 17:58.018
Mom's home.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.299
Plan B, I lay down in the hole,
you cover me up with dirt.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.174
What's that?

18:12.380 --> 18:14.371
"Daddy, please don't kill yourself"?

18:15.020 --> 18:17.250
Oh, well, maybe Peg forgot
about our anniversary.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.452
<i>I mean, it's not a topic
that'd be on Oprah or Geraldo.</i>

18:21.460 --> 18:25.612
I know, maybe if I don't say anything,
she won't.

18:25.820 --> 18:28.778
But if she does, I can count on you two
to kill me, right?

18:29.020 --> 18:31.090
You can count on us, Dad.

18:32.020 --> 18:35.330
Good.
Then that's present enough for this...

18:35.540 --> 18:38.532
...my 1-billionth anniversary.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.494
Hi, Al.

18:55.540 --> 18:57.178
Hi, Peg.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.573
You watching TV?

19:00.820 --> 19:02.173
Yep.

19:04.380 --> 19:06.496
Don't you think you should turn it on?

19:07.940 --> 19:09.419
Nope.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.858
So, Peg...

19:20.180 --> 19:22.057
...what'd you do all day?

19:22.260 --> 19:24.694
Oh, nothing.
Went out with Marcy...

19:24.900 --> 19:27.858
...spent a bunch of your money.
You know, same old, same old.

19:28.060 --> 19:30.415
- What'd you do today?
- Oh, nothing.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.496
Rented a tuxedo...

19:33.700 --> 19:35.770
...dug up the yard.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.610
You know, same old, same old.

19:43.540 --> 19:48.136
Isn't it nice to have an absolutely
nothing-out-of-the-ordinary kind of day?

19:48.700 --> 19:51.339
Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing, Peg.

19:51.660 --> 19:55.573
Happy Absolutely Nothing
Out of the Ordinary Day, Peg.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.095
Back at you, Al.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.776
Want to go upstairs?

20:02.620 --> 20:04.815
Why not? I'm already dirty.

20:14.140 --> 20:17.610
This isn't for anything special, right?

20:17.860 --> 20:19.976
Oh, no.

20:20.180 --> 20:22.011
I just thought that the best way...

20:22.220 --> 20:25.212
...to end an absolutely
nothing-out-of-the-ordinary kind of day...

20:25.420 --> 20:27.456
...was by doing absolutely nothing.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.015
I agree, Peg.

20:34.260 --> 20:36.137
<i>I found it.
I found the necklace.</i>

20:36.340 --> 20:37.534
<i>I didn't bury it.</i>

20:37.740 --> 20:39.537
<i>It was in my bowl.</i>

20:39.980 --> 20:43.939
<i>Odd, no one spotted it under
the two pieces of Kibble.</i>

20:44.500 --> 20:45.694
<i>Oh, guys?</i>

20:45.900 --> 20:47.618
<i>Guys?</i>

20:48.500 --> 20:52.095
<i>Buck, don't tell me
you forgot our second anniversary.</i>

20:52.620 --> 20:53.894
<i>Forget?</i>

20:54.100 --> 20:55.692
<i>Why no.</i>

20:56.820 --> 20:58.890
<i>Bibi.</i>

20:59.460 --> 21:01.098
<i>Of course.</i>

21:01.300 --> 21:05.339
<i>I didn't recognize your face.
I so rarely see this end of you.</i>

21:11.060 --> 21:13.654
<i>Well, did you get me anything?</i>

21:14.020 --> 21:16.454
<i>Did I get you anything?</i>

21:16.940 --> 21:18.612
<i>Oh, Buck.</i>

21:18.820 --> 21:22.574
<i>Oh, it's beautiful.
I'm so happy.</i>

21:23.140 --> 21:27.258
<i>Great. Can I take you to a toilet,
buy you a drink?</i>

21:28.820 --> 21:30.731
<i>Oh, Bucky.</i>

21:30.940 --> 21:33.500
<i>Do you wanna go upstairs?</i>

21:35.140 --> 21:36.778
<i>After you, my dear.</i>

21:41.340 --> 21:44.059
<i>Oh, Bibi. Now I remember.</i>

21:45.940 --> 21:48.579
<i>And they call me senile.</i>

21:49.305 --> 21:55.425
