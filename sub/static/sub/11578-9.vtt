WEBVTT

00:01.117 --> 00:02.808
In the criminal justice system

00:02.877 --> 00:04.437
sexually-based offenses

00:04.509 --> 00:06.070
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.429 --> 00:08.534
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.606 --> 00:10.494
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.558 --> 00:12.118
are members of an elite squad

00:12.190 --> 00:13.783
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.854 --> 00:15.481
These are their stories.

00:18.272 --> 00:20.573
What do you say?
Cover my shift on Friday?

00:20.639 --> 00:23.673
I told you, I got to spend the
day with the wife and her mother.

00:23.744 --> 00:26.078
Work my shift.
It's the perfect excuse.

00:26.144 --> 00:28.991
I like my mother-in-law.
It's the wife I can't stand.

00:30.496 --> 00:32.253
This wheel's stuck.

00:36.992 --> 00:38.421
Oh, man.

00:40.609 --> 00:41.984
Forty-five minutes there,
Doc.

00:42.048 --> 00:45.246
Please, murder is on the
menu today, so don't scold.

00:47.810 --> 00:49.849
Guess what? She's dead.

00:50.370 --> 00:53.021
Fresh gash to the arm.
Definitely post-mortem.

00:53.410 --> 00:56.890
Right. Dead about 12 hours.

00:58.178 --> 01:02.302
Blunt trauma to the head.
Anywhere from 12 to 15 years old.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.226
Track marks?
None yet.

01:04.290 --> 01:07.803
Could be hidden between the toes or in
her thighs. You think that she's a pro?

01:07.875 --> 01:09.882
Got called in
on a case like this last week.

01:09.955 --> 01:11.810
Girl was in the trade
and still had braces on.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.625
I wouldn't be surprised if some
pimp was trying to send a message.

01:14.691 --> 01:18.684
We're trying to hand this off to Homicide.
14 open rape cases are ahead of this one.

01:18.756 --> 01:22.052
Understood.
So give me a second.

01:23.940 --> 01:25.052
Find anything?

01:25.124 --> 01:27.067
Used condoms, syringes,
a couple of crack pipes.

01:27.140 --> 01:30.338
We'll be sifting for a while.
But we got the murder weapon.

01:30.405 --> 01:33.088
Couple of sales slips in her
pocket, and this charm bracelet.

01:33.157 --> 01:34.848
Any ID?
Sorry.

01:34.917 --> 01:37.154
Okay.
A receipt for bottled water...

01:37.222 --> 01:40.538
and one for Hamptons
Athletics, size six, $159.95.

01:40.614 --> 01:42.686
Expensive shoes.
Detectives.

01:44.710 --> 01:48.966
Fluids are present. Marked bruising to
the thighs, pelvic and vaginal areas.

01:49.030 --> 01:51.519
Handprint on the hip
and upper right buttock.

01:51.591 --> 01:53.184
Spanked and raped.

01:54.055 --> 01:55.582
Guess this one's ours.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.804 --> 02:49.928
Couple of partials. Handprint gives us a
size, but that's about it. No latent, no ID.

02:49.996 --> 02:52.581
Recent sex. She's a
non-consensual minor under 17,

02:52.652 --> 02:54.562
so it's either statutory
or rape one.

02:54.635 --> 02:57.319
Not to mention homicide.
Tenderloin kiddy pro?

02:57.389 --> 02:59.363
Or she's right off the bus
from Iowa.

02:59.436 --> 03:02.698
Not with that haircut and the bracelet
and the expensive running shoes.

03:02.764 --> 03:06.692
The only time I've ever seen a working girl
run is to pick up a trick or to get high.

03:06.764 --> 03:09.613
Any drugs in her system?
Tox screen's not back yet.

03:09.869 --> 03:13.034
She could be an actress.
She's flat. No implants.

03:13.133 --> 03:14.562
Still good for
the pedophile trade.

03:14.638 --> 03:17.061
Name your price in illegal porn
and the market will bear it.

03:17.134 --> 03:18.857
Let's concentrate
on the crime scene first.

03:18.927 --> 03:21.959
The blood type on the brick matches
the victim so she wasn't a dump job.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.885
Somebody saw
or heard something.

03:23.949 --> 03:25.543
We'll follow receipts
and Forensics.

03:25.614 --> 03:28.997
Good. Munch, Fin...
Let me guess, door-to-door.

03:29.294 --> 03:30.636
Clairvoyant.

03:34.128 --> 03:36.648
Nobody is here. Let's go.
We got other floors.

03:37.295 --> 03:38.757
I hear the TV.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.458
Police!

03:42.000 --> 03:45.066
I'd like to ask you a few
questions. I don't know anything.

03:48.945 --> 03:50.473
I don't want trouble.

03:50.609 --> 03:52.878
Nice view.
You like living here?

03:53.330 --> 03:56.079
Used to. Now there's
cheap whores everywhere.

03:56.145 --> 03:58.185
You chase them, they
come here. To paradise.

03:58.257 --> 04:00.363
Nothing like the fecund scent
of dead animals.

04:00.433 --> 04:04.295
I've been here 20 years. I mind
my own business. I stay another 20.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.711
An optimist.

04:06.802 --> 04:11.374
My grandfather lived to be 105
on ouzo and silence.

04:11.442 --> 04:13.515
A girl was murdered last night
outside your window.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.108
Another prostitute. Who cares?
I do.

04:16.274 --> 04:19.243
She was just a kid
about her age.

04:19.603 --> 04:22.637
You saw or heard it.
If you don't speak up...

04:26.868 --> 04:29.519
You would curse me?
Every day.

04:33.684 --> 04:36.946
Around 8:30, I heard shouting.

04:37.909 --> 04:39.949
I wouldn't go to the window.

04:40.468 --> 04:42.957
I didn't want to see. Yeah,
in case there was trouble.

04:43.028 --> 04:46.193
Can you describe the voices?
I hear someone yell, "Whore!"

04:46.517 --> 04:48.209
I turned up the TV.

04:49.431 --> 04:50.892
Thanks for your help.

04:56.022 --> 04:57.932
Talking Greek.
You're full of surprises.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.235
If I don't keep some mystery, you
might grow bored and stop loving me.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.089
Hi, excuse me... I'll be
with you in a minute, okay?

05:09.592 --> 05:11.959
Tell me that these
are worth $100.

05:12.791 --> 05:15.825
That's cheap. Maureen's been
begging me for a pair, costs $150.

05:15.895 --> 05:18.384
All of her friends have them.
Probably costs $3 to make.

05:18.456 --> 05:21.173
That's including the 50 cents a day
they pay child laborers. Excuse me.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.183
You want to try those on?
No thanks, though...

05:23.256 --> 05:25.231
I'd like you to look
at this receipt, please.

05:25.305 --> 05:26.832
Terrator running shoes.
Hot item.

05:26.904 --> 05:29.044
You remember who made that
purchase? You're kidding.

05:29.113 --> 05:31.568
Look around. This is a slow day.
Yeah, you recognize this girl?

05:31.642 --> 05:33.496
Maybe a regular customer?
She looks dead.

05:33.561 --> 05:35.602
She is. Petite,
blue eyes, 5'1"...

05:35.673 --> 05:39.089
Sorry. After a while, they all start
to look the same. I've got to get back.

05:39.162 --> 05:40.569
That's fine. Look...
Benson.

05:40.634 --> 05:42.805
You remember anything
you just give us a call.

05:42.874 --> 05:43.955
Okay.

05:45.307 --> 05:46.834
ME finished cutting.

05:49.306 --> 05:50.768
What've we got?

05:50.843 --> 05:53.494
Jane Doe is a young female,
Tanner stage three.

05:53.563 --> 05:57.457
That makes her about, 12-13? Yeah,
right about there. Maybe a little older.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.676
Cause of death?

05:58.747 --> 06:01.498
Massive subdural hematoma
causing herniation of the brain.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.017
Please tell me our perp's
a secretor. Definitely.

06:04.092 --> 06:06.940
And he left plenty of semen to
type. What about the bruising?

06:07.004 --> 06:08.597
Pelvic and pubic region.

06:08.667 --> 06:11.766
Also several healed fractures to
the ribs, both wrists, fingers.

06:11.837 --> 06:15.132
Long-term abuse? Too many
injuries for just plain clumsy.

06:15.229 --> 06:19.026
Drugs? Alcohol? Nothing,
except for diphenylmethane.

06:19.485 --> 06:21.373
Ingredient found in laxatives.

06:21.437 --> 06:24.285
Also has enamel erosion
on upper and lower incisors.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.619
Self-induced vomiting.
She was bulimic.

06:27.454 --> 06:31.316
She has very rough palms.
Blistered and healed over.

06:31.678 --> 06:35.323
The kind you see on day
laborers. She worked for somebody.

06:35.391 --> 06:38.238
What she was doing,
I won't hazard a guess.

06:42.303 --> 06:45.172
Madam's name is Ruth Jay,
who goes by Mama Jay.

06:45.727 --> 06:48.248
Specializes in pros
who pass as little girls.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.062
Parochial school skirts, baby-doll
dresses. You get the picture.

06:52.991 --> 06:55.959
What are we doing here?
Noon service.

07:00.641 --> 07:03.608
Preacher's gonna start any minute.
I don't want to miss the choir.

07:03.681 --> 07:05.983
We want to ask you a few
questions about your girls, Ruth...

07:06.049 --> 07:08.439
then you can go inside
and praise the Lord. Amen.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.008
A whore in church?

07:10.081 --> 07:13.377
If you studied the Bible, you'd
know that Mary Magdalene was a whore.

07:13.442 --> 07:14.816
She repented.

07:14.881 --> 07:18.974
So I'm a work in progress. Don't judge
me, or I'll get to Heaven before you.

07:20.419 --> 07:23.288
What can I do for you,
Detective? You know her?

07:24.995 --> 07:28.028
No. Pretty young thing.
What a shame.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.368
Just the kind of girl your
customers would like, right?

07:30.435 --> 07:33.599
I don't deal in children.
My girls just look the part.

07:35.620 --> 07:39.647
If she worked in the trade, check
with Willie Maxwell on Amsterdam.

07:39.716 --> 07:44.125
He rents special videos under the
counter. Anybody knows her, he will.

07:45.860 --> 07:47.454
I'll pray for you.

07:53.380 --> 07:55.770
Can I help you
with something, Officers?

07:56.646 --> 07:59.395
Yeah, have you seen this girl?
She's right up your alley.

08:02.725 --> 08:04.319
You gonna make me smack you?

08:04.390 --> 08:07.838
She looks familiar. But, no,
I can't say that I know her.

08:07.911 --> 08:11.207
Come on, Willie. You and I both know that
you have customers with special needs.

08:11.270 --> 08:14.206
All we're looking for is
an ID. I've never seen her.

08:15.879 --> 08:16.828
Hey.

08:17.927 --> 08:20.447
What's this?
He's returning that.

08:20.519 --> 08:22.908
Oh, yeah? I want to rent it.
Not available.

08:22.984 --> 08:24.772
What do you mean?
When I go to Blockbuster...

08:24.840 --> 08:27.655
I can rent whatever walks in the
door. I want to rent this tape.

08:27.721 --> 08:29.760
Okay, I know my rights.
You can't take that.

08:29.832 --> 08:31.774
You don't have probable cause.

08:31.848 --> 08:34.947
Anything you find without a
search warrant or probable cause...

08:35.015 --> 08:37.318
is fruit
from the poisonous tree.

08:38.282 --> 08:40.703
My man, you want to
walk away from this?

08:42.730 --> 08:44.552
I'm not talking without
my lawyer. No problem.

08:44.617 --> 08:47.301
We want to make sure you understand
what you're being charged with.

08:47.369 --> 08:51.200
It's a felony to possess kiddie
porn, magazines, videos, photographs.

08:51.274 --> 08:54.787
We have a statement from your customer
saying that he rented that video from you.

08:54.859 --> 08:57.990
That was his tape. No, you
already claimed possession.

08:58.059 --> 09:01.190
You know something? We're not even
really interested in these charges.

09:01.259 --> 09:02.404
You're not?
No.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.751
We're not.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.694
Then what do you want?
Who's the girl?

09:08.139 --> 09:11.042
What's in it for me? Now's
not the time to play games.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.003
Seems like
a pretty good time to me.

09:13.068 --> 09:15.785
You want something.
You think I've got it.

09:16.108 --> 09:19.491
Let's barter. Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.

09:19.756 --> 09:22.090
We're not going to house you
in general population...

09:22.157 --> 09:24.098
and announce that a pedophile
is coming through.

09:24.173 --> 09:26.344
We'll do that
if you ID the girl...

09:26.541 --> 09:29.673
and give us a list of every
private video customer you have.

09:31.981 --> 09:33.541
I don't know her.

09:35.533 --> 09:39.112
She's not a starlet
in one of your productions?

09:41.358 --> 09:44.358
You think I wouldn't remember
something that sweet?

09:51.406 --> 09:53.862
I need a shower.
Not until you check this out.

09:53.935 --> 09:55.876
We got a match
on your Jane Doe.

09:56.623 --> 09:59.852
Carla Brice, age 13. Height
and weight all looks good.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.116
From Queens. What about Willie?
We got him on possession.

10:03.183 --> 10:06.348
We'll get his list of customers
and arrest every hump on it.

10:11.056 --> 10:13.424
How long has she been missing?
Four days.

10:14.705 --> 10:16.810
Did you find her?
We don't know.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.915
That's why we're here. We
need to ask you some questions.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.207
You must know something,
or you wouldn't have come.

10:23.282 --> 10:25.224
Does your daughter
wear jewelry?

10:27.506 --> 10:29.513
A cross my mother gave her.

10:30.929 --> 10:34.673
And sometimes bracelets and a
necklace. What kind of bracelets?

10:36.115 --> 10:38.668
I don't know.
She traded with her friends.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.107
Is she hurt?
Is my baby all right?

10:42.194 --> 10:44.650
Did your daughter
participate in any sports?

10:45.300 --> 10:46.412
Track.

10:47.636 --> 10:50.865
Why are you asking me these
questions? Tell me, what do you know?

10:50.931 --> 10:54.379
Mrs. Brice,
did anybody hurt Carla?

10:58.901 --> 11:00.526
It's all my fault.

11:03.028 --> 11:06.346
We moved here to get away from
her father, but he found us.

11:09.525 --> 11:13.038
She was trying to protect me, and
he hit her, and then she took off.

11:13.111 --> 11:15.445
Had this happened before?
Yes.

11:16.821 --> 11:18.676
But Carla always came home.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.872
God, I'm so sorry.

11:24.631 --> 11:26.453
I tried to get away from him.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.002
Please take me to see her.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.975
We're ready.
I can't.

11:41.049 --> 11:44.431
It's okay. We're right here.
We're going to stay with you, okay?

11:44.760 --> 11:46.670
We're going to
stay right here.

11:47.928 --> 11:50.994
Hold on to me.
That's it. You set?

12:00.250 --> 12:01.559
Oh, my God!

12:07.579 --> 12:10.229
It's not her.
It's not my Carla.

12:23.227 --> 12:24.983
All the details seemed right,
Captain.

12:25.052 --> 12:26.940
Everything matched up,
down to the broken bones.

12:27.004 --> 12:28.858
Mistakes happen.
You did your job.

12:28.924 --> 12:31.226
Yeah, sometimes
this job stinks.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.515
We had a uni
take home Mrs. Brice.

12:34.589 --> 12:36.563
Told her we'd keep an eye out
for Missing Persons.

12:36.637 --> 12:39.321
Who's gonna keep an eye
out for Jane Doe? I am.

12:39.389 --> 12:40.916
Lab lifted off
two sets of prints.

12:40.989 --> 12:42.876
One the victim's,
another partial.

12:42.941 --> 12:45.844
Neither in the system. By the
way, those are real diamonds.

12:45.918 --> 12:49.464
How do you know that? One of my
exes had a taste for fine jewelry.

12:49.598 --> 12:53.078
Five teddy bears studded with
diamonds. Folks must have money.

12:53.150 --> 12:56.020
"All my love, Popi."
I'd like to talk to him.

12:56.094 --> 12:58.963
Maybe we can. Piece like that,
handcrafted, probably one of a kind.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.412
I know a guy
in the jewelry district...

13:00.479 --> 13:02.650
who could probably give us a
read on who made this stuff.

13:02.719 --> 13:05.850
That's a start. Meanwhile, you
two get back to Missing Persons.

13:05.919 --> 13:06.966
Cast a wider net.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.684
Outer boroughs, out of state, outer
space. She's got to come from somewhere.

13:12.671 --> 13:14.330
Very cute.
Cute?

13:14.400 --> 13:15.829
Teddy bears
are big this season.

13:15.903 --> 13:18.107
That's interesting,
but not exactly helpful.

13:18.175 --> 13:20.761
Custom piece, 18 karat...

13:21.055 --> 13:24.537
diamonds, GVS quality,
well cut.

13:24.993 --> 13:27.611
Look at the pavé work.
It's exceptional.

13:28.545 --> 13:31.229
Anything that points to a
specific designer or craftsman?

13:31.297 --> 13:34.975
You see that initial on the
bear's paw? If you say so.

13:35.041 --> 13:39.319
Yeah, that 'W' stands for Wallerstein.
Emil Wallerstein. One of the best.

13:39.778 --> 13:43.039
Do you know where we can
find him? He's semi-retired.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.018
Only designs for one store.

13:45.091 --> 13:48.571
His son-in-law's, Petrie's.
Corner of Park and 59th.

13:48.643 --> 13:50.170
Thanks a lot. See you again.
Yeah.

13:52.419 --> 13:54.559
We get 20 reports a day.
All go into the computer...

13:54.627 --> 13:57.442
crosschecked against the DOA's
brought into the Medical Examiner.

13:57.508 --> 13:58.816
We gave you the only match.

13:58.884 --> 14:02.364
Let's fudge it a little with the
hair color, height and weight.

14:02.436 --> 14:05.536
Depending on when she disappeared,
those stats might have changed.

14:05.604 --> 14:08.190
Here's one, 34, red hair.
No. Next.

14:08.259 --> 14:10.879
How about this?
Twenty-five... No, too tall.

14:12.837 --> 14:15.204
Twenty-one-year-old, butterfly
tattoo on left buttock.

14:15.269 --> 14:16.677
No, no tats.

14:18.501 --> 14:22.561
Here's a new one. Sixteen years old,
brown hair, blue eyes, 5' even, 92 Ibs.

14:22.630 --> 14:25.477
Reported missing by guardian,
an llya Korska.

14:25.541 --> 14:28.542
Last seen leaving gymnastics
practice. Name is Kristy Meyerson.

14:28.614 --> 14:31.070
Explains the calluses.
You got an address?

14:37.670 --> 14:39.297
Keep your legs together.

14:40.328 --> 14:41.888
Watch your toes.

14:42.952 --> 14:44.959
Squeeze your legs together.

14:45.128 --> 14:46.273
Again!

14:47.367 --> 14:50.564
You want to be champion, you must
accept nothing less than perfection.

14:50.633 --> 14:53.665
My ankle...
Pain is the price of glory.

14:54.439 --> 14:57.157
Here. Now, you do it again.

14:57.224 --> 15:00.607
And this time, you spot
the wall, like I told you.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.960
That's my girl. Now, go.

15:06.120 --> 15:10.147
Amanda, Patsy, Lori,
take a lesson from Danielle.

15:10.217 --> 15:13.032
She has a heart of a champion.
Ilya Korska?

15:13.705 --> 15:15.331
Kind of hard on them,
aren't you?

15:15.403 --> 15:18.337
They don't know what they're
capable of until they try.

15:18.441 --> 15:21.027
They know that I push them
because I love them.

15:21.450 --> 15:23.306
Who let you in here?
Detective Stabler.

15:23.370 --> 15:25.542
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.

15:26.412 --> 15:29.510
You found Kristy? Is there
someplace we can go and talk?

15:31.020 --> 15:32.427
Keep her working.

15:35.212 --> 15:36.870
Who would do such a thing?

15:38.123 --> 15:40.971
The Missing Persons report
lists you as her guardian.

15:41.325 --> 15:44.674
Her parents placed her under my
care so that she could train here.

15:44.748 --> 15:46.853
Nothing like this
has ever happened.

15:47.277 --> 15:50.211
Where are her parents?
In Oregon.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.019
They have money?
Not really.

15:54.958 --> 15:57.478
Father sells insurance,
mother is a secretary.

15:58.317 --> 16:01.219
They sacrificed everything so that
Kristy could train with the best.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.043
What about boyfriends?
Anyone named Popi?

16:04.174 --> 16:06.345
My girls have no time
for boyfriends.

16:06.958 --> 16:08.365
They're teenagers.

16:08.430 --> 16:12.587
They are elite athletes, striving for
an honor that very few will attain.

16:13.103 --> 16:16.998
To win a gold medal requires
absolute dedication. Kristy had that.

16:17.263 --> 16:19.652
When was the last time
you saw her?

16:20.720 --> 16:23.240
Day before last,
after practice.

16:23.727 --> 16:27.470
Where'd she go after practice?
I assume that she went home.

16:28.592 --> 16:31.210
You're her guardian.
Didn't she stay with you?

16:31.440 --> 16:35.531
No, she lived with a family
whose young daughter I also train.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.838
Very good people.

16:37.905 --> 16:41.134
We're going to need their address and
anyone else connected with the gym.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.398
Workers, coaches, athletes.
Of course.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.956
Anything I can do to help.

16:51.666 --> 16:53.674
She could have
been a champion.

16:56.018 --> 16:59.814
I bet Kristy got those bruises
working out. I'd call it abuse.

16:59.987 --> 17:01.580
I'll get the car.

17:02.707 --> 17:05.074
You looked pretty terrific
on those bars.

17:05.236 --> 17:08.268
Yeah, right.
I'm the big dough girl.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.722
What're you talking about? You
don't have an ounce of fat on you.

17:11.796 --> 17:15.440
Why'd I get my period?
Because it's natural.

17:16.051 --> 17:18.867
No, because I'm
not training hard enough.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.208
Love your open-door policy.

17:53.718 --> 17:56.108
May I help you?
Yes. This belong to you?

17:57.304 --> 18:00.468
It's one of our custom pieces.
Exquisite, isn't it?

18:00.568 --> 18:01.878
How much is it worth?

18:01.944 --> 18:05.327
Without checking the computer,
I'd estimate around $8,000.

18:05.656 --> 18:08.078
Would that computer be able
to tell us who bought that?

18:08.153 --> 18:10.706
Of course. We keep meticulous
records on all our clients...

18:10.777 --> 18:13.591
including past purchases,
birthdays, anniversaries.

18:13.658 --> 18:15.479
Would you mind
looking it up?

18:15.768 --> 18:19.512
I have customers waiting. Oh,
yeah? Well, make them wait.

18:24.314 --> 18:27.413
Has anyone told her parents?
Mr. Korska called them.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.199
They're flying in from Oregon as
soon as they can book a flight.

18:30.266 --> 18:32.950
Her mother calls every Wednesday
and Sunday, like clockwork.

18:33.019 --> 18:36.019
When did you last see Kristy?
Day before yesterday.

18:36.474 --> 18:38.614
She came home around
dinnertime, like always...

18:38.683 --> 18:42.481
and changed into her running clothes
and headed out to run with Lori.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.766
And who's Lori?

18:43.836 --> 18:46.520
Another gymnast. They run
every night. Never miss.

18:46.844 --> 18:49.364
She's usually home
by 10:00, though...

18:49.436 --> 18:52.600
and so when it got to be
midnight, I called llya.

18:52.859 --> 18:56.602
I haven't slept since. What's
your arrangement with Mr. Korska?

18:57.021 --> 19:01.658
We board girls in his program. They
come from all over to train with him.

19:02.717 --> 19:06.492
And not all of the parents
can afford to move with them...

19:06.557 --> 19:10.332
so llya places them with
families he knows and trusts.

19:10.557 --> 19:12.216
And what do you get
for your trouble?

19:12.287 --> 19:14.074
He trains our daughter
Hannah for free.

19:14.142 --> 19:17.884
And gives us a small stipend
to help defray costs.

19:18.238 --> 19:21.370
But we do it because we love
the girls and want to help.

19:21.439 --> 19:24.089
Are there any other boys
or young men living here?

19:24.159 --> 19:27.290
No. Kristy was
our only boarder.

19:27.935 --> 19:30.619
Who are you talking to?
What's wrong, Mommy?

19:30.687 --> 19:33.785
Nothing, sweetheart,
this is...

19:33.855 --> 19:36.638
Hi, I'm Olivia.
This is my friend Elliott.

19:36.704 --> 19:37.947
Hi.
Hi.

19:38.016 --> 19:39.804
What's your name?
Hannah.

19:39.872 --> 19:42.556
Hey, Hannah.
She idolizes Kristy.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.813
What do you say Hannah shows me
Kristy's room? Let you two finish up.

19:47.041 --> 19:49.343
Sweetheart, would you like to
show Olivia Kristy's room?

19:49.408 --> 19:50.489
Okay.

19:52.737 --> 19:56.033
Did Kristy ever
talk about her social life?

19:56.097 --> 19:58.684
You know, boyfriends,
guys in the neighborhood?

19:59.521 --> 20:01.344
Gymnastics was her life.

20:01.410 --> 20:05.119
She dreamed of going to the Olympics.
It was all she ever talked about.

20:06.147 --> 20:09.594
She ever mention someone
named Popi? Not that I recall.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.681
What can you tell me about her
relationship with Coach Korska?

20:16.611 --> 20:21.314
She adored him,
feared him, respected him.

20:21.731 --> 20:24.317
She was so grateful to be
accepted into his program...

20:24.388 --> 20:26.843
I think she would have done
anything for him.

20:28.068 --> 20:30.850
I mean, sometimes I even
thought she tried too hard.

20:32.005 --> 20:36.161
Kristy's really good. She teaches me
things, like how to tuck when I somersault.

20:36.228 --> 20:39.490
Do you know when she's
coming home? You know what?

20:40.677 --> 20:44.605
Your mom is going to
talk to you about that later.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.525
But first, maybe you can help
me do something to help her.

20:47.590 --> 20:50.624
What? I'm trying to
find Kristy's boyfriend.

20:51.111 --> 20:52.899
Did he ever come over?
No.

20:52.966 --> 20:56.926
No. Do you ever remember Kristy
talking about somebody named Popi?

20:57.831 --> 20:59.619
You do? What did she say?

21:00.167 --> 21:02.818
My mom says it's not nice
to spy on people.

21:03.014 --> 21:06.593
I know, and your mom's right. But you
know what? I'm just trying to help her.

21:06.664 --> 21:08.769
So, it's okay.
You can tell me.

21:10.024 --> 21:12.479
Sometimes Kristy
talked to him on the phone.

21:12.553 --> 21:15.138
She said she'd meet him
after she went running.

21:15.624 --> 21:17.992
Did you ever hear Kristy say
where Popi lives?

21:18.057 --> 21:19.748
No.
No.

21:20.265 --> 21:22.948
Do you remember hearing
Kristy say anything else?

21:23.849 --> 21:27.199
This is really important.
One time she thanked him.

21:27.272 --> 21:28.483
For what?

21:29.289 --> 21:32.223
This teddy bear.
Kristy loves teddy bears.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.038
Am I noticing a theme here?

21:36.105 --> 21:39.586
Another gift from Popi, who,
by the way, is not her father.

21:39.657 --> 21:43.237
According to Hannah, Kristy used to
sneak out to meet him on her nightly runs.

21:43.307 --> 21:45.281
I have
the running mate's address.

21:45.643 --> 21:48.905
I waited till 8:30, but she never
showed, so I just ran without her.

21:48.972 --> 21:51.754
You two run together every
night? Yeah, 8:00 sharp.

21:51.819 --> 21:55.267
We meet at the pier and run along the
promenade to Battery Park City and back.

21:55.340 --> 21:57.249
That's a hell of a jog.
We're in training.

21:57.324 --> 21:59.331
We've got to drop the weight
or Korska will drop us.

21:59.404 --> 22:00.418
He that tough?

22:00.492 --> 22:03.176
He pulls out a tape measure and
scale for surprise inspections.

22:03.243 --> 22:06.179
If you don't measure up, you're
out. It's the only way you can win.

22:06.253 --> 22:08.391
Tell us about Popi.
Who?

22:08.812 --> 22:13.002
Lori, come on. We know Kristy used these
nightly runs as an excuse to go see him.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.977
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.298
There's no reason
to cover for her anymore.

22:19.533 --> 22:21.638
I'm not covering for anybody.

22:22.126 --> 22:25.421
Kristy loved gymnastics. She never
met with any guy when she was with me.

22:25.486 --> 22:27.307
That's grounds for dismissal.

22:27.726 --> 22:29.865
Can we talk later?
I'm late for my workout.

22:29.934 --> 22:31.909
Sure.
Wouldn't want to hold you up.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.358
What's the matter?
What?

22:43.087 --> 22:44.910
What, "what"?
You tell me what.

22:45.359 --> 22:48.230
I'm just... I'm not
cutting it. Cutting what?

22:49.360 --> 22:52.174
This college recruiter came from
Columbia today to talk to us.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.437
Yeah? And it's a really great school.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.808
Okay.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.468
What's the problem?

23:00.881 --> 23:03.151
I got a B+
on my English midterm.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.224
That's great.

23:06.546 --> 23:09.164
I'm never going to get in
with grades like that.

23:10.930 --> 23:13.996
Maureen, you're 15. Relax.

23:19.346 --> 23:21.452
Nothing like
a little healthy competition.

23:21.522 --> 23:25.483
We found a stockpile of diuretics
and laxatives in Kristy's room.

23:25.555 --> 23:28.369
What ever happened to just
hanging out on the jungle gym?

23:28.435 --> 23:31.850
Went the way of your eight-track tape.
These girls are competing in a world...

23:31.923 --> 23:34.378
where anything less than a
perfect 10 is considered failure.

23:34.452 --> 23:37.354
And llya Korska is the pied
piper to the promised land.

23:37.428 --> 23:39.370
What's up with this guy,
anyway?

23:39.668 --> 23:43.563
Defected from Bulgaria in '88.

23:43.636 --> 23:47.412
Coached 13 gold medallists and
scores of silvers and bronze.

23:47.476 --> 23:49.517
Has a multi-million-dollar
endorsement contract...

23:49.588 --> 23:52.109
and he just he runs a lucrative
private coaching business.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.603
Got no priors.
Running a check with Interpol.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.721
Any luck on your end?

23:57.334 --> 24:00.946
We traced the bracelet to
a guy named Kyle Hubert, 42.

24:01.014 --> 24:03.251
A high-end real estate broker
on the Upper West Side.

24:03.318 --> 24:04.976
Wait a minute.
I know that name.

24:06.327 --> 24:10.321
Listed as a Gold Circle contributor
to the llya Korska Athletic Foundation.

24:10.391 --> 24:12.627
Well, looks like
we found Popi.

24:17.432 --> 24:20.562
One of our board members
called just before you arrived.

24:21.944 --> 24:25.425
Are you certain that it wasn't
an accident? It was murder.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.716
You have a blank check from me to
help catch the animal that did this.

24:29.783 --> 24:32.818
Thank you, that won't be
necessary. Is this Kristy?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.760
Yes. She was amazingly gifted.

24:36.825 --> 24:39.859
Lithe, fluid, graceful.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.666
She could have taken
the gold at Nationals.

24:43.737 --> 24:46.487
How long have you been
involved in girls' gymnastics?

24:46.552 --> 24:50.328
As a donor, 10 years. I try
to help out wherever I can.

24:50.523 --> 24:53.369
You've given quite a bit of money
to llya Korska's organization.

24:53.433 --> 24:55.222
He's the best coach
in the country.

24:55.291 --> 24:57.298
We've also heard that
you've been quite generous.

24:57.370 --> 25:00.535
Some of the girls received
scholarships and expensive gifts.

25:00.827 --> 25:03.161
Those who show special
promise and talent.

25:03.355 --> 25:05.111
You recognize this bracelet?

25:07.099 --> 25:08.823
I bought it for Kristy. Why?

25:08.924 --> 25:11.924
You always engrave your gifts,
"With all my love, Popi"?

25:12.156 --> 25:16.466
It was her nickname for me. She said
that I reminded her of her father.

25:18.044 --> 25:20.281
When did you give it to her?
Tuesday.

25:20.349 --> 25:21.756
The night she died.

25:23.036 --> 25:25.971
You give it to her that night?
No, in the morning.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.867
Where were you
Tuesday night?

25:27.934 --> 25:29.875
Here, working late.
How late?

25:30.717 --> 25:33.499
10:00, 11:00.
Can anyone verify that?

25:34.365 --> 25:36.023
What are you insinuating?

25:37.085 --> 25:40.216
That you were sleeping
with her. I was not.

25:40.286 --> 25:42.969
Would you be willing to submit
to a blood test to confirm that?

25:43.039 --> 25:44.948
Absolutely not.
Why not?

25:45.086 --> 25:47.705
I won't be subjected
to your witch-hunt tactics.

25:49.471 --> 25:51.031
We only want the truth.

25:52.639 --> 25:54.233
Talk to my lawyer.

25:55.839 --> 25:57.781
We're gonna need a court order
to get that sample.

25:57.855 --> 25:59.349
Why don't we
hit Korska's place,

25:59.423 --> 26:01.430
see what the girls have to say
about their benefactor.

26:01.503 --> 26:03.577
Maybe someone saw him
with Kristy that night.

26:05.377 --> 26:08.246
I've known him for 10 years.
He's a fine, upstanding gentleman.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.136
We believe that he was having a
relationship with Kristy Meyerson.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.273
Impossible. My girls
don't have relationships.

26:13.345 --> 26:17.437
He gave her a very expensive
bracelet. As a reward for working hard.

26:18.337 --> 26:20.378
Kyle Hubert
is respected by the USOC...

26:20.449 --> 26:23.166
and every athletic governing
body associated with gymnastics.

26:23.234 --> 26:25.656
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't be here.

26:26.595 --> 26:27.871
Excuse me.

26:28.610 --> 26:30.880
Girls! Come.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.564
All right, let's go.
On the bar.

26:34.978 --> 26:39.103
I don't feel I'm missing out on anything.
My dream is to go to the Olympics.

26:39.171 --> 26:42.816
Tell me about your coach. He's
amazing. I'm so lucky to be here.

26:42.883 --> 26:44.738
You don't mind all the yelling
and screaming?

26:44.804 --> 26:48.416
No, it's worse if he ignores you.
That means he doesn't care anymore.

26:49.220 --> 26:52.537
What happened to your wrist?
I was working on a new move.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.468
A double-twisting double back.

26:56.932 --> 26:59.834
It must've been wet. I slipped.
I gotta get back to my work now.

26:59.909 --> 27:02.178
Yeah, just one second.
I just have one more question.

27:02.244 --> 27:05.889
Do you know a guy named
Kyle Hubert? You know him?

27:06.213 --> 27:08.483
I hate how he's
always staring at us.

27:09.446 --> 27:13.636
He ever give you presents? Sometimes.
Like a new outfit or a gym bag.

27:14.502 --> 27:19.010
Or this one time he gave me body lotion.
He told me to think of him when I used it.

27:22.790 --> 27:26.140
So tell me about an average
day. I'm up by 4:30...

27:26.215 --> 27:30.045
get here at 5:00, leave by 9:00
and then I have school till 1:30.

27:30.503 --> 27:33.887
Sometimes llya gets the doctor to
write a note, and I don't have to go.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.105
Lucky you.

27:35.175 --> 27:38.950
Then after school, I have practice
till 9:00 or 10:00 and I do my homework.

27:39.015 --> 27:42.561
So when do you eat? I only
have breakfast and some fruit.

27:43.977 --> 27:46.432
I gotta lose weight
if I'm gonna make the cut.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.310
What can you tell me
about Kyle Hubert?

27:52.073 --> 27:55.718
He hangs around a lot.
Watches us practice.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.312
He pays for my room and board.

27:58.794 --> 28:01.282
And there's this one thing
he does that makes me so mad.

28:01.353 --> 28:04.650
What's that?
He calls me Olive Oyl.

28:08.267 --> 28:10.885
I scored 38
in my last five comps.

28:11.275 --> 28:15.073
I'm not bragging, but I've got a new
dismount that's better than anyone else's.

28:15.532 --> 28:18.150
Why didn't you tell us
about Kristy's boyfriend?

28:18.315 --> 28:21.163
What boyfriend?
Kyle Hubert.

28:22.091 --> 28:24.099
Kyle Hubert?
Yeah.

28:24.940 --> 28:27.787
She'd meet with him after you two
ran. You never knew about that?

28:27.853 --> 28:31.595
Why would she tell me? If I'd
known, I'd have to tell Coach. Rules.

28:33.965 --> 28:36.485
It all makes sense, though.
Yeah? What does?

28:36.813 --> 28:39.563
Mr. Hubert was always
giving her the best presents.

28:39.693 --> 28:42.443
Bracelets, clothes,
stuffed animals.

28:43.886 --> 28:45.991
I guess she liked
all the attention.

28:48.334 --> 28:49.763
Wouldn't you?

28:50.607 --> 28:52.167
He creeps me out.

28:55.151 --> 28:57.093
Alibi?
He says he worked late.

28:57.167 --> 29:00.168
Nobody was there to confirm or
deny. What about the bracelet?

29:00.238 --> 29:01.416
He gives all the girls gifts.

29:01.487 --> 29:04.804
Apparently he gives himself only to
Kristy. At least no one else is talking.

29:04.878 --> 29:07.148
But his financials
made a statement.

29:07.216 --> 29:10.663
Daddy Rich Bucks has a little love
nest. TRW came back with two mortgages.

29:10.735 --> 29:14.412
One for a pad uptown. The other, a
couple of blocks from the slaughterhouse.

29:18.384 --> 29:20.173
They were here.
What time?

29:20.497 --> 29:22.536
Around 8:00.
You sure about that?

29:22.801 --> 29:25.257
She ran out the building
crying. He ran after her.

29:25.329 --> 29:28.592
Did you hear anything else?
He said he'd never let her go.

29:29.585 --> 29:31.014
Told me the girl
was his daughter.

29:33.937 --> 29:36.240
Got it.
Let's go.

29:44.946 --> 29:46.539
That son of a bitch.

29:47.348 --> 29:49.070
Welcome to Fantasyland.

29:49.139 --> 29:51.343
Perfect for a fairy princess.

29:52.627 --> 29:54.121
He's no prince.

30:00.627 --> 30:03.148
A little girl's dream
turned into a nightmare.

30:08.245 --> 30:11.212
Kyle liked to party.
And savor the memories.

30:16.373 --> 30:18.991
Looks like Daddy
forgot to change the sheets.

30:21.015 --> 30:24.659
The semen-stained sheets gave us enough
DNA to match the semen from the body.

30:24.726 --> 30:27.027
Not to mention the letters,
pictures and videotapes.

30:27.094 --> 30:30.160
And an apartment manager who puts you
with Kristy the night of the murder.

30:30.231 --> 30:32.019
Why would I kill her?
I worshipped her.

30:32.086 --> 30:35.403
Is that why she went running from your
apartment in tears the night she died?

30:35.478 --> 30:36.853
She had ended it with you,
hadn't she?

30:36.918 --> 30:38.261
You couldn't
take the rejection.

30:38.327 --> 30:39.571
Or risk the exposure.
What?

30:39.639 --> 30:42.007
You raped and murdered her.
I did not.

30:42.071 --> 30:45.367
Twelve hours of videotape
and matched semen say you did.

30:46.616 --> 30:49.038
It was consensual.
She was 16.

30:49.112 --> 30:52.112
It's called statutory rape. Consensual
or not, you're going to jail.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.224
The only question is
for how long.

30:58.776 --> 31:00.686
Is that what
this is all about?

31:02.201 --> 31:06.357
That sense of humor is going to serve
you well with your bunkmates up in Attica.

31:06.809 --> 31:09.329
I could have saved you
both a lot of work.

31:10.714 --> 31:15.024
We kept our relationship
private, to protect the program.

31:15.993 --> 31:17.653
Kristy was not a child.

31:18.874 --> 31:20.783
She was 19 years old.

31:28.987 --> 31:32.697
Hubert's not lying. She was 19. We
got a copy of her birth certificate.

31:32.763 --> 31:34.488
In other words,
you've got no case.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.762
It's amazing.
She only looks 14.

31:40.572 --> 31:42.906
It's sick,
but it's not illegal.

31:42.972 --> 31:45.112
Then why did Kristy
lie about her age?

31:45.181 --> 31:47.036
By the time she was
good enough for Korska...

31:47.101 --> 31:49.784
she was older than most girls,
so she shaved off a few years.

31:49.853 --> 31:53.847
She did a damn good job of covering her
tracks. Korska claims he didn't know.

31:54.622 --> 31:57.469
How did Hubert? He follows
all the local events.

31:57.532 --> 31:59.868
He notices Kristy's been
around longer than she claims.

31:59.934 --> 32:01.428
He preyed
on her vulnerability.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.411
These girls sacrifice
their childhoods to win.

32:03.487 --> 32:06.104
They're starved for love.
Not to mention food.

32:06.239 --> 32:09.086
They stopped eating to
maintain their perfect weight.

32:09.310 --> 32:13.467
That stops their menstrual cycle. No
cycle, no estrogen. No estrogen, no growth.

32:13.567 --> 32:15.902
Physically,
emotionally and sexually.

32:15.967 --> 32:18.040
Leaves guys like Hubert
just licking their chops.

32:18.111 --> 32:20.348
Yeah, but it's not a motive
for killing her.

32:21.568 --> 32:23.162
What about Korska?

32:23.615 --> 32:25.176
Look, the kids
aren't the only ones

32:25.249 --> 32:26.622
performing for the judges.

32:26.721 --> 32:30.649
Prints off the bracelet came back. One
is Kristy's. The other isn't Hubert's.

32:30.721 --> 32:33.339
Check Immigration.
They'll have prints on Korska.

32:33.889 --> 32:36.223
This guy may be
up to more than we think.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.453
Captain,
Mom and Dad are here.

32:43.234 --> 32:46.943
She was so pretty.
An angel.

32:49.122 --> 32:51.838
Do you have any idea who
might have hurt your daughter?

32:51.906 --> 32:56.216
No. Everyone loved her. No,
everyone loved to watch her.

32:58.371 --> 33:00.737
We put our life savings
into her training.

33:00.803 --> 33:03.933
Traveled to competitions,
moved from coach to coach.

33:04.259 --> 33:06.114
She was
so close to her dream.

33:06.692 --> 33:09.856
Why did Kristy lie about
her age? She didn't lie.

33:10.980 --> 33:15.290
She just didn't discuss it. Korska
doesn't like to work with older girls.

33:16.612 --> 33:19.100
She was a young woman.
Did she ever date?

33:19.429 --> 33:21.152
Kristy was a virgin.

33:25.028 --> 33:28.924
She was seeing someone.
What are you talking about?

33:29.157 --> 33:32.006
She never told me. She
knew you'd never understand.

33:32.678 --> 33:36.833
I am her mother. I did it all
for her. You did it for yourself.

33:44.007 --> 33:47.619
What else did Kristy tell you?
That she was in love with him.

33:48.615 --> 33:52.674
And desperately afraid Korska would dump
her from the program if he found out.

33:58.567 --> 34:00.258
Coach kept a tight rein
on his girls.

34:00.328 --> 34:02.532
And a tight grip
on Kristy's wrist.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.735
His prints
were on the bracelet.

34:07.657 --> 34:09.282
Arms straight.
Keep your arms straight.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.302
Lori.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.188
Lori.
Can't talk now.

34:13.353 --> 34:15.873
We're looking for your coach.
He went to dinner.

34:16.553 --> 34:18.146
Hey, what's wrong?

34:18.889 --> 34:20.580
I swore not to tell.

34:21.481 --> 34:25.541
Lori, I don't know what the problem
is, but honestly, we just want to help.

34:27.402 --> 34:30.632
Coach couldn't trust Kristy,
so he had me watch her for him.

34:31.947 --> 34:33.670
You spied on Kristy?

34:35.306 --> 34:39.136
Kyle was sleeping with her. He gave
her clothes and a charm bracelet.

34:40.204 --> 34:42.275
Why didn't you
tell us that before?

34:43.596 --> 34:47.687
Coach promised me a spot on the team
if I told him and kept my mouth shut.

34:49.612 --> 34:53.190
Today, he called me fatso and
said I might not make trials.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.723
When did you tell him?

34:57.901 --> 35:00.268
The day Kristy died.
What did Korska do?

35:01.037 --> 35:02.597
He ran off to find her.

35:03.021 --> 35:05.291
Leave her alone.
She needs to practice.

35:06.830 --> 35:09.961
We're done with Lori, but we've
got some questions for you.

35:11.438 --> 35:14.023
Girls are always coming to me
with their petty complaints.

35:14.093 --> 35:15.850
Lori said that you
told her to watch Kristy.

35:15.917 --> 35:18.471
Stupid kid was throwing it away.
For what? Clothes? Trinkets?

35:18.541 --> 35:21.390
Love?
Love has no place in my gym.

35:21.455 --> 35:23.975
Where did you go after Lori
told you about Kyle?

35:24.046 --> 35:26.086
I followed her to the
dirty cockroach's apartment.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.745
And then? And then I
left. What could I do?

35:28.816 --> 35:31.718
No, you didn't.
You waited for her.

35:32.048 --> 35:35.561
Kyle Hubert gave her a bracelet
that night. Your prints were on it.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.781
All right. I grabbed her wrist
when she came out.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.888
Her hair was messed up.
She smelled like sex.

35:43.952 --> 35:47.117
I told her to break it off with
that scum or you're through.

35:47.696 --> 35:49.005
Then she went back inside.

35:49.072 --> 35:52.869
Then she came running back out crying
after she'd broken it off with him.

35:54.002 --> 35:57.198
She begged me for forgiveness.
She wanted a second chance.

35:57.266 --> 35:59.655
So I took the little whore
down the street for a run.

35:59.729 --> 36:02.315
The girl was hysterical,
and you made her go running?

36:03.378 --> 36:05.516
I'm not paid
to teach weakness.

36:05.586 --> 36:07.212
What time
did you drop her off?

36:07.443 --> 36:08.687
8:15.

36:12.371 --> 36:15.371
Korska claims he picked up
Kristy at Hubert's apartment...

36:15.443 --> 36:17.680
and dropped her off
to run at 8:15.

36:17.748 --> 36:21.228
Assuming Korska's telling the truth.
Which he may not be, since Lori says...

36:21.299 --> 36:23.667
that she didn't run with Kristy
the night of Kristy's murder.

36:23.731 --> 36:26.698
Old lady Pappas says she heard
someone yell "whore" an hour later.

36:26.772 --> 36:29.009
Right outside,
Kristy's body was found.

36:29.077 --> 36:31.313
Something made her veer off
that promenade.

36:31.381 --> 36:33.803
So if we can figure out what
happened to her from here...

36:33.877 --> 36:35.471
to where she
veered off the promenade...

36:35.541 --> 36:37.876
we'll know how her body got
behind that dumpster.

36:38.388 --> 36:40.942
Sounds like mere speculation
masquerading as fact.

36:41.013 --> 36:42.769
Your theory
cries for an eyewitness.

36:42.837 --> 36:46.221
And something tells me you have one,
or you wouldn't be acting so smug.

36:46.294 --> 36:48.083
Am I that transparent?

36:48.790 --> 36:50.928
"V" is for your
friendly neighborhood vendor.

36:50.999 --> 36:53.813
I went to the promenade this morning.
I spoke to a couple of joggers.

36:53.879 --> 36:57.359
They said this guy sets up his cart
around noon and stays till late.

36:57.431 --> 37:00.048
What do you say we go pay
Munch's hunch a visit?

37:02.647 --> 37:05.811
Yeah, I seen her. She's the
one that got herself killed.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.457
She used to come by running here
every night with that cute redhead.

37:09.528 --> 37:12.462
I tell you, I could set my watch
by her. Can you ID the redhead?

37:12.664 --> 37:15.217
Yeah. Sweet little thing.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.800
Yeah. She used to always get a
water for herself and her friend.

37:21.017 --> 37:24.911
She still run by here? Every
night. I'll tell you, it worries me.

37:25.113 --> 37:27.699
I always thought they were
too young to be out at night.

37:27.769 --> 37:30.136
Do you remember the last time
you saw them running together?

37:30.202 --> 37:33.170
Last Monday. On account
of I'm off on Tuesdays.

37:34.106 --> 37:37.489
Same night Kristy was killed. You're
sure they were together Monday?

37:37.561 --> 37:40.180
Positive. They stopped
by for their usual water.

37:40.602 --> 37:43.668
Though, come to think of it, they
took off in another direction.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.909
Which way?
Down that street.

37:45.979 --> 37:47.834
Usually they
stay on the jogging path.

37:47.898 --> 37:50.485
But I think maybe they
were trying a new route.

37:57.916 --> 38:00.054
8:30 exactly.
Just like clockwork.

38:00.380 --> 38:03.959
Lori, can I talk to you for a
second? I got to finish my run.

38:04.028 --> 38:06.298
This won't take long.
You're in my way.

38:06.364 --> 38:08.470
Kind of like Kristy
was in your way?

38:12.125 --> 38:15.474
How long am I gonna be here?
I've got to go train.

38:15.677 --> 38:17.587
Coach is gonna cut me
if I don't make weight.

38:17.661 --> 38:19.319
Just a few more questions.

38:19.421 --> 38:23.252
Okay, you said that Kyle Hubert
gave Kristy a charm bracelet?

38:24.094 --> 38:26.811
Right? Yeah, he gave
her a lot of nice things.

38:27.326 --> 38:29.114
Lori, how did you
know about the bracelet...

38:29.183 --> 38:31.704
when you didn't see Kristy
the night she died?

38:35.743 --> 38:37.816
You want me to be
sorry she's dead.

38:39.583 --> 38:40.761
I'm not.

38:41.631 --> 38:43.933
I didn't have some
rich boyfriend, okay?

38:45.280 --> 38:48.728
I didn't have some pretty little
face. Nobody ever cared about me.

38:49.376 --> 38:51.318
So Kristy
got all the attention.

38:52.257 --> 38:54.264
She got everything so easy.

38:56.192 --> 38:58.015
I do it all on my own.

38:58.913 --> 39:00.823
My parents don't love me.

39:01.761 --> 39:03.965
The only one who does
is Coach, and...

39:05.666 --> 39:09.277
he lied to me.
How'd he lie to you?

39:10.658 --> 39:13.407
He promised me I could
have her spot if I told him.

39:16.259 --> 39:17.917
Kristy was waiting for me.

39:20.385 --> 39:24.664
She had broken up with Kyle, and
Coach said he'd keep her on the team.

39:27.652 --> 39:29.594
That left no place for me.

39:31.107 --> 39:34.555
And you couldn't let her take that
away from you, could you, Lori?

39:39.973 --> 39:41.664
We started to argue.

39:45.061 --> 39:47.362
She got everything so easy.

39:50.148 --> 39:52.538
She started to run away,
so I followed her.

39:57.254 --> 39:59.873
The brick just
flew out of my hand.

40:00.550 --> 40:02.818
I didn't
mean for it to hit her.

40:08.423 --> 40:10.016
She made me do it.

40:22.343 --> 40:24.929
Alignment! Tummies in.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.229
Coming to stir up
more trouble?

40:27.304 --> 40:29.192
Lori confessed
to killing Kristy.

40:29.256 --> 40:30.598
Lori's an imbecile.

40:30.666 --> 40:32.039
Strong arms.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.209
Again.

40:34.954 --> 40:38.782
She wants to see you.
Soon. After Nationals.

40:39.433 --> 40:43.295
Very nice, my little pumpkins,
very nice. Up again.

40:43.882 --> 40:45.955
Show Korska what you can do.

40:48.266 --> 40:52.128
Legs together.
Tummy in. Good.

40:52.491 --> 40:53.952
That's my girls.
