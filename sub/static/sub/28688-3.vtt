00:29.842 --> 00:33.811
Whoo! Rocket pack!

00:33.913 --> 00:35.779
You know how much fuel
you just wasted?

00:35.881 --> 00:36.947
I don't know.

00:37.049 --> 00:38.732
How much paint did
Michelangelo "waste"

00:38.834 --> 00:40.601
on the Sistine Chapel?

00:40.703 --> 00:41.964
Yeah, but when Mikey
ran out of paint,

00:41.971 --> 00:43.771
he didn't die in space.

00:43.873 --> 00:45.606
Well, let's just cross
that bridge

00:45.708 --> 00:47.941
when we never ever cross
it because it doesn't exist.

00:48.044 --> 00:49.743
Would you just trace the...

00:49.845 --> 00:50.878
Shut up, Lana.

00:50.980 --> 00:52.579
I'm trying to trace the signal

00:52.681 --> 00:54.948
and it's right... there!

00:55.067 --> 00:57.735
Nanotube-reinforced
reactor grid.

00:57.837 --> 00:59.603
Man if we can re-tune that,

00:59.705 --> 01:01.839
it'll sell for 18 months
of operating costs.

01:01.941 --> 01:04.908
And, more importantly,
a sizable bonus for us.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.844
<i>First off, no.</i>

01:06.946 --> 01:09.847
<i>We badly need a restock of
Gran Classico.</i>

01:09.949 --> 01:12.900
Second...

01:13.002 --> 01:16.937
And third, Cyril's picked
up a... what was it?

01:17.039 --> 01:20.774
I've got a class D ship on
a hyperbolic intercept orbit!

01:20.876 --> 01:22.826
- Yes, that.
- It's right there!

01:22.912 --> 01:25.913
For the thousandth time,
we can't see you pointing!

01:26.015 --> 01:28.699
And why wasn't that
the first thing?

01:28.801 --> 01:30.834
<i>Because I said two
other things first?</i>

01:30.936 --> 01:32.703
All right.
We've trained for this.

01:32.805 --> 01:34.805
Cyril, on guns.
We need cover.

01:34.907 --> 01:35.973
On it.

01:36.075 --> 01:37.808
Krieger,
spool up hyperspace drive.

01:37.910 --> 01:39.843
- Spooling!
- Cheryl, get to your fighter.

01:39.945 --> 01:41.678
Lame!

01:41.781 --> 01:44.014
- Ray, you're still useless.
- You know...

01:44.116 --> 01:46.834
Pam, swoop in with
the gig, lasso the grid,

01:46.936 --> 01:48.669
and tow it to the ship.

01:48.771 --> 01:50.771
Pam? Pam!

01:50.873 --> 01:52.906
<i>Paaam!</i>

01:54.877 --> 01:56.944
<i>What? I'm right
fricking here!</i>

01:57.046 --> 01:59.813
I don't know. Maybe we got
attacked by scavengers,

01:59.915 --> 02:02.900
barely got out with the
power core, and... oh, right!

02:03.002 --> 02:04.968
I ran out of fuel
and almost died!

02:05.070 --> 02:07.004
Something about a bridge...

02:07.106 --> 02:09.038
Who am I, Santiago Calatrava?

02:09.140 --> 02:10.741
- The shortstop?
- No.

02:10.842 --> 02:12.113
That's what I'm
gonna call my foot

02:12.144 --> 02:15.045
when it's gracefully
yet powerfully suspended

02:15.147 --> 02:16.713
up your ass!

02:16.816 --> 02:18.015
Look, I feel terrible, guys.

02:18.117 --> 02:19.800
No more mistakes!

02:19.902 --> 02:21.802
I'll be the perfect
crew member from now on.

02:21.904 --> 02:23.904
Which is why you skipped
the debriefing?

02:24.006 --> 02:25.873
I said from now on.

02:25.975 --> 02:28.008
And came directly
to the mess hall!

02:28.110 --> 02:29.877
I eat my feelings?

02:29.979 --> 02:31.945
- Amongst everything.
- Don't be a dick.

02:32.047 --> 02:34.781
Why would he possibly stop now?

02:34.884 --> 02:36.834
It's kind of
a big part of my draw.

02:36.936 --> 02:39.031
Look, I just came down here
to get a leftover sandwich

02:39.038 --> 02:40.871
from that time we were on
Toba Station.

02:40.973 --> 02:43.774
Dibs! Dibs, dibs, dibs,
dibs, dibs!

02:43.876 --> 02:46.910
Where are you, you beautiful...

02:59.775 --> 03:01.909
What... the hell... was that?

03:02.011 --> 03:04.878
That would be my sandwich.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.841
What do we know about it?

03:50.943 --> 03:52.809
Well, apparently
it's allergic to compliments.

03:52.912 --> 03:54.011
And ate all our food.

03:54.113 --> 03:56.680
The food?
But that's what we eat!

03:56.782 --> 03:57.981
Where did it come from?

03:58.083 --> 04:00.934
Well, originally it was
a sandwich from Toba Station?

04:01.036 --> 04:03.737
See, you eat it while
it's alive and struggling,

04:03.839 --> 04:05.772
but it was definitely
dead when I finished.

04:05.874 --> 04:06.940
It must've regenerated.

04:07.042 --> 04:08.775
Be that as it may!

04:08.877 --> 04:10.944
We need a plan before
this gets out of hand.

04:11.046 --> 04:13.981
It laid eggs!
Weird gross eggs!

04:14.083 --> 04:16.065
Cool! Lemme see!

04:16.168 --> 04:17.834
Uh, how many?

04:17.937 --> 04:19.937
I don't know!
They're everywhere!

04:20.039 --> 04:22.806
So we've got an alien on
board that's multiplying,

04:22.908 --> 04:25.842
no food, and scavengers might
still be tracking us.

04:25.945 --> 04:27.010
Anyone have an idea

04:27.112 --> 04:30.013
that doesn't involve us
dying in space?

04:30.115 --> 04:31.848
I vote dying.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.800
Archer, Lana,
you go find this thing.

04:33.902 --> 04:35.035
Gillette, Cheryl,

04:35.137 --> 04:36.870
gather all the scraps of food
that are left

04:36.972 --> 04:38.739
to see if we can make
the next spaceport.

04:38.841 --> 04:41.775
Krieger, study the eggs.
Try to find a weakness.

04:41.877 --> 04:44.745
Cyril, Ms. Archer, keep
scanning for those scavengers.

04:44.847 --> 04:45.946
Now if you'll excuse me,

04:46.048 --> 04:48.899
I have to stride somewhere
with purpose!

04:51.036 --> 04:51.969
Wow.

04:52.071 --> 04:53.770
Now, I wanna say that's dumb,

04:53.872 --> 04:55.739
because, well, Pam.

04:55.841 --> 04:57.874
- Yeah, but that's...
- Actually...

04:57.977 --> 04:59.776
A good idea.

04:59.878 --> 05:02.045
So, if I were
to hypothetically suss out

05:02.147 --> 05:04.081
the military applications of...

05:04.183 --> 05:06.967
Okay, yes, I see by
your faces yes.

05:07.069 --> 05:09.002
Got it! Won't do that!

05:09.104 --> 05:11.805
We're going to have
such adventures together.

05:11.907 --> 05:13.302
Yeah, that won't come
back to haunt us.

05:13.309 --> 05:14.975
I'll keep an eye on him,

05:15.077 --> 05:17.010
and just kill that thing,
Sterling,

05:17.112 --> 05:20.147
before Krieger uses it
to mutate us all into,

05:20.249 --> 05:23.200
let's say, space goo.

05:24.970 --> 05:26.903
I vote space goo.

05:27.006 --> 05:28.105
- So are you gonna...
- Shh!

05:28.207 --> 05:30.007
Shut.
Shut your mouth.

05:30.109 --> 05:32.109
I will not let you
ruin this for me

05:32.211 --> 05:34.811
like you have
so many other times.

05:36.181 --> 05:40.000
I. Am. Ready.

05:49.178 --> 05:50.911
- Ya done?
- What?

05:51.046 --> 05:53.013
I don't know how to do
the volume on this thing.

05:53.115 --> 05:55.015
- I said, "ya done?"
- Oh, got it.

05:55.117 --> 05:56.867
I think so.

05:56.969 --> 05:59.002
There's nothing left,
and also I can barely move.

05:59.104 --> 06:01.038
And that's gonna help you
catch this thing how?

06:01.140 --> 06:03.907
All of this, Lana,
is totally necessary!

06:08.347 --> 06:10.080
Actually, let's see where it is.

06:10.182 --> 06:11.982
I only have another seven,
eight steps in me.

06:13.235 --> 06:15.202
Huh. This says it's within
two meters.

06:15.304 --> 06:17.104
Which would only
make sense if...

06:17.206 --> 06:19.906
Oh, screw you,
two-dimensional display.

06:28.250 --> 06:31.101
Hey, hey, Lana!
It's friendly!

06:31.203 --> 06:34.171
Also laying gross eggs.
Pretty much constantly.

06:34.273 --> 06:36.206
And the cloaca blooms.

06:37.242 --> 06:38.942
And what does that mean,

06:39.044 --> 06:40.911
other than that you now
have a sideline

06:41.013 --> 06:42.913
in Georgia O'Keefe sculptures?

06:43.015 --> 06:45.015
The eggs contain
self-healing DNA.

06:45.117 --> 06:46.166
If I can isolate it,

06:46.268 --> 06:49.102
I might unlock the secret
of regeneration.

06:49.204 --> 06:51.972
And they called me mad.

06:52.074 --> 06:53.073
- Who did?
- Huh?

06:53.175 --> 06:55.142
Oh, I guess I just assumed.

06:55.244 --> 06:57.911
Safe bet.

06:58.013 --> 07:00.013
So, do you want the bad news?

07:00.115 --> 07:03.233
- Or the what?
- Uh, there is no other news.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.936
Then why did you ask?

07:06.038 --> 07:07.237
Rhetorical effect?

07:07.339 --> 07:09.239
Well, it stopped us
in our tracks, Cicero,

07:09.341 --> 07:11.241
so mark it as ineffective.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.176
Look, we don't have
enough food to make it

07:13.278 --> 07:15.045
to the nearest spaceport.

07:15.147 --> 07:17.032
Even if we carefully rationed
out the scraps here,

07:17.116 --> 07:18.215
we still wouldn't have...

07:19.401 --> 07:22.002
He's incorrigible.

07:22.104 --> 07:23.937
- Damn it, Archer!
- What?

07:24.039 --> 07:26.134
He said there wasn't enough
food to make it to spaceport.

07:26.141 --> 07:29.109
Nothing's changed!
So I accept your apology.

07:29.211 --> 07:31.111
Ooh!
It's starting.

07:31.213 --> 07:33.137
We'll tear ourselves apart
with suspicion and doubt

07:33.215 --> 07:35.932
and then eat each other!
I call first dibs!

07:36.034 --> 07:39.035
- To eat or be eaten?
- Whatever. I'm not picky.

07:39.138 --> 07:41.905
Better sharpen those chompers.

07:42.007 --> 07:44.040
I am so confused by your tone.

07:44.143 --> 07:46.276
Me too.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.245
It may not come to that.

07:48.347 --> 07:50.280
Using the egg,
I may have found a way

07:50.382 --> 07:52.265
to regenerate our cells
as we starve.

07:52.367 --> 07:54.968
It won't be pleasant...

07:55.070 --> 07:56.236
- But?
- No, I was done.

07:56.338 --> 07:58.071
Let me guess.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.006
There's a chance
it'll turn us into space goo?

08:00.108 --> 08:02.175
No! Well, yes.
Actually, it's pretty likely.

08:02.277 --> 08:04.010
How'd you know that?

08:04.112 --> 08:06.313
Because it's always
space goo with you.

08:06.415 --> 08:08.081
Well, not just that.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.266
We should eat the eggs.

08:09.368 --> 08:11.301
Oh, these hook-covered,
evil-smelling, pus sacks

08:11.403 --> 08:14.371
that just happen to be the
property of my new best friend?

08:14.473 --> 08:17.140
But they make you feel amazing!

08:19.311 --> 08:21.178
But you didn't even know
we were out of food.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.079
So when did you
start eating those?

08:23.182 --> 08:24.281
Pretty much immediately.

08:34.876 --> 08:36.243
Start this off
on the wrong foot,

08:36.345 --> 08:38.244
but I'm thinking of
eating your feet.

08:38.313 --> 08:40.212
When I said we had
to consider our options,

08:40.315 --> 08:42.085
this is not what I meant.
Well, I didn't hear

08:42.150 --> 08:43.933
anyone else suggesting anything!

08:44.035 --> 08:45.267
Because you told me to shut up!

08:45.304 --> 08:47.070
And here you are talking.

08:47.172 --> 08:48.905
I meant something that leaves us

08:49.007 --> 08:50.273
with the right number of feet!

08:50.375 --> 08:53.176
Lana, it's offensive to call
it "the right number of feet"

08:53.278 --> 08:56.246
when those lacking limbs are
valuable members of society.

08:56.348 --> 08:58.114
Hey, yeah!

08:58.217 --> 09:00.025
It's also why you should
let me eat your feet.

09:00.102 --> 09:01.301
This seems productive.

09:01.403 --> 09:03.236
Shouldn't you be scanning?

09:03.338 --> 09:05.272
- I think Cyril's on that.
- Not on that.

09:05.374 --> 09:07.240
And clean yourselves up.

09:07.342 --> 09:09.175
You go a few days without food,

09:09.278 --> 09:11.177
and suddenly you look
like a pack of Okies

09:11.280 --> 09:14.180
matted with wet dirt.

09:14.283 --> 09:15.382
Uh, it's called mud,

09:15.484 --> 09:17.367
and why is it that you
don't care about starving?

09:17.469 --> 09:20.203
Oh, I've trained myself
to live on a liquid diet.

09:20.305 --> 09:22.038
I guess that's
the upside of having blood

09:22.140 --> 09:23.294
that's basically formaldehyde.

09:23.342 --> 09:25.242
So you're essentially
pre-embalmed.

09:25.344 --> 09:27.077
Okay, look, We're all hungry.

09:27.179 --> 09:29.980
Let's just calm down
and stop insulting Mother

09:30.082 --> 09:31.343
until I think of
a really good one.

09:31.350 --> 09:32.966
I'll mark my calendar.

09:34.436 --> 09:37.037
Aww, look.
It's dreaming.

09:37.139 --> 09:39.105
Shouldn't we try
eating these eggs?

09:39.207 --> 09:40.974
I mean, before we drown in them?

09:41.076 --> 09:43.176
Not yet! Krieger says
they're loaded with all sorts

09:43.278 --> 09:46.079
of crazy chemicals
and God knows what.

09:46.181 --> 09:47.314
Pam seems okay.

09:47.416 --> 09:49.065
Does she?

09:52.271 --> 09:56.306
Pow-pow-pow-pow-pah!

09:56.408 --> 09:59.009
Anyhoo, just hang tight.

09:59.111 --> 10:00.977
Krieger might have
something soon

10:01.079 --> 10:03.179
and for God's sake,
show some restraint.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.200
I must be pretty hungry.
Now I'm hearing things.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.069
- Uh, that's not imaginary.
- Good.

10:09.171 --> 10:11.171
'Cause I was about
to kick my imagination's ass

10:11.273 --> 10:14.140
for having terrible taste.
What is that?

10:14.242 --> 10:17.110
It sounds like a piano
double-crossed the Yakuza.

10:20.449 --> 10:22.365
♪ Struck oil from the start ♪

10:22.467 --> 10:25.035
♪ But the real land
you stole was in my... ♪

10:25.137 --> 10:26.336
Please don't say "heart."

10:26.438 --> 10:29.205
Start-heart is the lyrical
equivalent of light-beige.

10:29.308 --> 10:31.041
What is all this here then?

10:31.143 --> 10:33.009
Hey, remember when
you said I was useless?

10:33.111 --> 10:35.145
Honestly, no,
but it does sound like me.

10:35.247 --> 10:36.379
"All this here then"

10:36.481 --> 10:38.281
is me finally finding
my true purpose in life.

10:38.383 --> 10:40.166
Didn't you come out,
like, years ago?

10:40.268 --> 10:42.068
Yeah, there's more to me

10:42.170 --> 10:43.370
than my sexuality.
Eh.

10:43.472 --> 10:46.139
For example, my love
of musical theater.

10:46.241 --> 10:48.108
And that's distinct from...

10:50.178 --> 10:52.112
I'm writing what
I always dreamed of:

10:52.214 --> 10:55.181
A rock musical about
the Teapot Dome Scandal.

10:55.283 --> 10:56.294
That is the worst idea...

10:56.301 --> 10:57.300
Let me finish!

10:57.402 --> 10:59.035
With some hip-hop elements.

10:59.137 --> 11:00.303
I stand corrected.

11:00.405 --> 11:02.305
Please tell me it's not
called "Off the Dome."

11:02.407 --> 11:04.174
Why?
Do you not like that?

11:04.276 --> 11:06.376
Well, I'm proud of you
for pursuing your dream.

11:06.478 --> 11:08.178
Thank you very much.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.480
But you sure seem to have
a lot of energy

11:10.582 --> 11:12.315
for a starving person!

11:12.401 --> 11:13.555
Come on, where's your stash?

11:13.568 --> 11:15.335
Be more specific!

11:15.437 --> 11:17.270
This room is basically
nothing but contraband!

11:17.372 --> 11:19.372
- Your food stash!
- I don't have any!

11:19.474 --> 11:22.175
I'm just filled with
a glowing sense of purpose.

11:22.277 --> 11:24.177
Now if you'll leave me
to my art,

11:24.279 --> 11:26.479
I have to find a rhyme with
Mineral Leasing Act!

11:26.581 --> 11:29.432
The Crédit Mobilier scandal
would be much more compelling!

11:29.534 --> 11:31.334
- You take that back!
- Oh, come on!

11:31.436 --> 11:33.203
Union Pacific Railroad.

11:33.305 --> 11:35.405
One of the central guys
was named George Train.

11:35.507 --> 11:37.140
That writes itself!

11:37.242 --> 11:38.375
Nothing writes itself!

11:40.178 --> 11:41.244
Don't listen to them.

11:41.346 --> 11:43.213
Nothing but great calls,
baby Ray!

11:45.417 --> 11:47.167
God, these eggs are dynamite.

11:47.269 --> 11:49.102
<i>Neurological dynamite, that is.</i>

11:49.204 --> 11:52.172
Loaded with neurotransmitters.
So what do they do?

11:52.274 --> 11:54.307
The human brain
is fiendishly complex.

11:54.409 --> 11:58.144
It's all neurons and
electricity and mooshy parts.

11:58.246 --> 12:00.313
- So you don't know?
- We'd have to scan someone

12:00.415 --> 12:02.248
while they ate one
for the first time.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.134
But that could cause anything!

12:04.236 --> 12:06.269
Define "anything."

12:06.371 --> 12:09.172
Hmm, insanity,
memory loss, death,

12:09.274 --> 12:11.341
or a sexual syndrome
called Brainaphilia

12:11.443 --> 12:13.309
that I just now invented.

12:13.412 --> 12:18.348
So testing on a live subject
would be totally unethical.

12:18.450 --> 12:20.233
Let's use Cheryl.

12:20.335 --> 12:23.403
Wait, were we considering
anything else?

12:23.505 --> 12:26.473
So, hitting the sauce
pretty hard?

12:26.575 --> 12:28.174
It's not sauce!

12:28.276 --> 12:29.504
I didn't think it
was literally...

12:29.511 --> 12:31.177
It's marinade!

12:31.279 --> 12:33.179
And that's how
that conversation ended.

12:33.281 --> 12:35.415
Hey, the map thingy says
that we're flying toward

12:35.517 --> 12:38.134
the Fang Nebula.
So it does.

12:38.236 --> 12:40.136
Well, aren't there like
six overlapping wars

12:40.238 --> 12:41.304
going on there right now?

12:41.406 --> 12:43.406
Why do people rob banks, Cheryl?

12:43.508 --> 12:45.308
If I'm remembering this right,

12:45.410 --> 12:48.311
it's because the action
is the juice?

12:48.413 --> 12:50.380
Because that's where
the money is,

12:50.482 --> 12:52.382
and if we're looking
for salvage,

12:52.467 --> 12:54.467
you fly into the teeth of chaos

12:54.569 --> 12:58.438
and howl at the shadow
of death itself!

12:58.540 --> 13:01.274
So say we all.

13:01.376 --> 13:03.209
Greetings, Rat Racers.

13:03.311 --> 13:05.345
How does it feel to follow
orders like robots,

13:05.447 --> 13:07.447
pawns in your own lives?

13:07.549 --> 13:09.365
Cyril?
What are you doing?

13:09.468 --> 13:11.267
Other than mixing metaphors

13:11.369 --> 13:13.236
into some kind of
smoothie-like paste.

13:13.338 --> 13:14.608
As little as possible, muchacha.

13:14.639 --> 13:16.473
Why aren't you scanning?

13:16.575 --> 13:18.408
Oh, my gosh, you're right.
Hold on.

13:20.445 --> 13:21.611
Yep, all clear.

13:21.713 --> 13:24.514
We're in deep space.
Nothing's ever on the scanner.

13:26.401 --> 13:27.629
<i>It's all a scam to keep you busy</i>

13:27.636 --> 13:29.369
<i>while they rob you
of your freedom.</i>

13:29.471 --> 13:32.405
Freedom to what, become
a human Jimmy Buffet B-side?

13:32.507 --> 13:34.507
You mean awesome and underrated?

13:34.609 --> 13:38.378
No. Stop twisting my words!
Lana, he's twisting my words!

13:38.480 --> 13:41.481
Can we just get to the point?
Cyril, did you find food?

13:41.583 --> 13:43.233
You bet I did.

13:45.337 --> 13:49.239
I came here to do two things:
Eat eggs and nothing

13:49.341 --> 13:51.274
and I'm not out of either.

13:51.376 --> 13:52.575
Now get out.

13:54.312 --> 13:55.545
What is going on?

13:55.647 --> 13:57.480
I know.
Why am I in the hallway?

13:57.582 --> 13:58.676
No. That's not what I was...

13:58.683 --> 14:00.433
Wait, did I just
do what he said?

14:00.535 --> 14:02.368
Oh, no. He's the alpha!

14:02.470 --> 14:03.603
He cares less than I do!

14:03.705 --> 14:06.639
I... I don't wanna live in
a world where Cyril's cool!

14:06.741 --> 14:08.641
So, you're not worried
that our crew

14:08.743 --> 14:11.578
seems to be going insane
and/or starving?

14:11.680 --> 14:14.314
Listen to me, I'm talking
about something important.

14:14.416 --> 14:16.633
My intrinsic dominance
over other males.

14:16.735 --> 14:18.535
You think he'd let me groom him?

14:18.637 --> 14:20.336
It's something about those eggs.

14:20.438 --> 14:21.699
This might be the
starvation talking

14:21.706 --> 14:24.307
or the fact that I don't like
the looks of your feet,

14:24.409 --> 14:26.543
but maybe we should
just eat the eggs?

14:26.645 --> 14:27.677
Everyone's acting weird,

14:27.779 --> 14:29.546
but I guess they're
not dead, right?

14:29.648 --> 14:32.348
Yeah, so what's the worst
that could happen?

14:32.450 --> 14:34.334
Dot, dot, dot.

14:34.436 --> 14:37.337
How did this happen?
I hate you!

14:37.439 --> 14:38.533
Yeah, and I don't usually
have a thing

14:38.540 --> 14:39.572
for older divorced ladies.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.407
- Hey!
- I'm kidding.

14:41.509 --> 14:43.376
I totally have a thing
for older divorced ladies.

14:44.479 --> 14:45.511
Not all the time.

14:45.614 --> 14:47.380
It's like a...
What's the drink called?

14:47.482 --> 14:49.465
Like a drink you drink
between other drinks.

14:49.568 --> 14:52.335
Like aperitif, but not.

14:52.437 --> 14:54.437
God, Cyril's gonna be pissed.

14:54.539 --> 14:56.439
Not digestif, that's after...

14:56.541 --> 14:58.441
wait, you're sleeping
with Cyril?

14:58.543 --> 15:00.610
- And why would you care?
- I don't know!

15:00.712 --> 15:04.547
I guess deep down,
I still care what you do.

15:04.649 --> 15:07.400
That's very slightly touching.

15:07.502 --> 15:08.772
I mean, you're my ex-wife, Lana.

15:08.803 --> 15:10.637
What you do reflects back on me.

15:10.739 --> 15:14.374
Oh, this from the guy that
just called me an intermezzo!

15:14.476 --> 15:15.642
That's it! Intermezzo!

15:15.744 --> 15:17.443
That was really bothering me.

15:17.545 --> 15:19.379
This is a nightmare.

15:19.481 --> 15:21.748
Talking to you is like talking
to a very selfish rock

15:21.850 --> 15:23.466
with mother issues!

15:23.568 --> 15:25.368
Rocks don't have moms!

15:25.470 --> 15:27.437
Unless you count volcanoes.

15:27.539 --> 15:29.572
But speaking of things
that are hard as a rock...

15:29.674 --> 15:31.574
Great segue.
That was pretty amazing, right?

15:31.676 --> 15:34.444
Unfortunately, yes.

15:34.546 --> 15:35.612
Round two?

15:38.683 --> 15:40.667
Does it bother you
that it's watching us?

15:43.738 --> 15:45.438
Why?

15:54.249 --> 15:56.265
How long do you need?

15:56.368 --> 15:58.635
After that sexual Iditarod?

15:58.737 --> 16:00.622
Two minutes, 15 seconds.
Should we maybe discuss

16:00.639 --> 16:02.372
what's going on with the ship

16:02.474 --> 16:05.308
and, uh, how we should maybe
do something about it?

16:05.410 --> 16:07.526
Now you've pushed it back
to three with all that talk,

16:07.545 --> 16:08.611
so might as well.

16:08.713 --> 16:10.680
I just want to look at it!

16:10.782 --> 16:12.548
Oh, my God, what's that?

16:14.536 --> 16:15.767
Huh. I... I guess
it was nothing.

16:15.804 --> 16:18.404
Oh, put a sock in it, Benedict.

16:18.506 --> 16:19.767
You've fallen for that,
like, four times.

16:19.774 --> 16:21.607
At some point, it is your fault.

16:21.710 --> 16:24.644
You're calling it... no.
I will not engage with that.

16:24.746 --> 16:27.413
Are you sure? I've got a
whole series of quips about it.

16:27.515 --> 16:29.565
We're under the influence
of something, right?

16:29.634 --> 16:32.368
I think we've just finally
discovered our true feelings.

16:32.470 --> 16:34.303
All the games can stop now.

16:34.406 --> 16:36.439
We're gonna be together forever.

16:38.677 --> 16:41.411
Yeah, yeah, we're egg crazy.

16:41.513 --> 16:43.479
Which explains why
we're setting sex records

16:43.581 --> 16:47.333
in both frequency and duration
and probably distance,

16:47.435 --> 16:50.370
if they measured sex in that.
So, let's go talk to Krieger,

16:50.472 --> 16:51.766
figure out a solution
to our starvation problem

16:51.773 --> 16:53.673
and then get rid of these eggs.

16:53.775 --> 16:56.376
Or we could just have sex again?

16:56.478 --> 16:57.477
Yup, probably that.

17:01.649 --> 17:03.599
Krieger, I command that
you scan me!

17:03.702 --> 17:05.401
I already am!

17:05.502 --> 17:07.436
Because I command it!
All is well.

17:07.539 --> 17:09.439
Huh, same as Gillette and Cyril.

17:09.540 --> 17:10.673
Tough to see brain changes

17:10.775 --> 17:12.575
with all the background egg
in your blood.

17:12.676 --> 17:14.410
This scanner sees
through clothes.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.646
Why are we in our underwear?
Why indeed?

17:16.748 --> 17:18.548
I did it because Pam told me to!

17:18.650 --> 17:20.400
- Hey, me too!
- Patton couldn't lift

17:20.502 --> 17:21.733
these nuts. Hooah!

17:21.836 --> 17:24.670
My current hypothesis
is that these neurotransmitters

17:24.772 --> 17:26.472
free you from mental blocks

17:26.574 --> 17:28.508
and let you pursue
your deepest wishes.

17:28.610 --> 17:29.509
Leadership!

17:29.611 --> 17:30.576
Doing nothing!

17:30.678 --> 17:32.412
"Off the Dome!"

17:32.514 --> 17:34.547
And we're married to that title?

17:34.649 --> 17:36.532
Do you just live
in doorways now?

17:36.634 --> 17:38.668
Found this one nibbling
on a power cord.

17:38.770 --> 17:41.404
What are you, part Mynock?

17:41.506 --> 17:44.373
No! I was just trying
to tenderize myself!

17:44.476 --> 17:45.541
Now who's stupid?

17:45.643 --> 17:47.443
Can't believe we were
so wrong about you.

17:47.545 --> 17:49.378
Cheryl, can you step in here

17:49.481 --> 17:50.775
and put this in your mouth?
Ha, not gonna

17:50.782 --> 17:53.466
fall for that again.

17:53.568 --> 17:54.734
Damn it!

17:54.836 --> 17:57.470
- How do you feel?
- I don't feel any different.

17:57.572 --> 18:01.407
I mean, hmm, I kinda
want to blow up the ship,

18:01.509 --> 18:02.625
but I always want to do that.

18:02.677 --> 18:03.709
There goes your theory.

18:03.812 --> 18:05.778
No, I think this actually
confirms it!

18:05.880 --> 18:07.747
Because she has
no impulse control,

18:07.849 --> 18:09.565
the eggs don't affect her!

18:09.667 --> 18:11.501
That's totally unfair!

18:11.603 --> 18:12.735
Uh-oh.

18:12.837 --> 18:15.504
It seems these eggs
are also highly addictive.

18:15.573 --> 18:17.607
- No, they're not!
- That's ridiculous!

18:17.709 --> 18:20.777
Krieger, I think
it's time we took a walk.

18:20.879 --> 18:22.779
Ooh, I love secret plans!

18:25.784 --> 18:27.500
Oh, God.

18:27.602 --> 18:29.702
I just ejaculated dust,

18:29.804 --> 18:32.772
and I'm pretty sure it was
my own pulverized skeleton.

18:32.874 --> 18:34.740
One more go?

18:34.843 --> 18:35.775
So, hey guys.

18:35.877 --> 18:37.677
Ugh. I would act startled

18:37.779 --> 18:39.612
but it would probably kill me.

18:39.714 --> 18:41.647
Turns out those eggs
are highly addictive

18:41.749 --> 18:43.599
and make you act out
your deepest desires.

18:43.701 --> 18:45.635
Yeah, that's kind of
where we came out on it.

18:45.737 --> 18:47.570
So if you'll excuse us.

18:47.672 --> 18:49.505
Please, don't mind me.

18:49.607 --> 18:50.573
Do we mind?

18:50.675 --> 18:51.829
I mean, I could go either way.

18:51.910 --> 18:53.576
Yes, we mind!

18:53.678 --> 18:55.478
And I mind that
this ship is doomed

18:55.580 --> 18:56.779
if no one does their jobs!

18:56.881 --> 18:57.814
Oh, come on. It's...

19:00.735 --> 19:02.602
Probably fine.
But if this keeps up,

19:02.704 --> 19:04.504
we're probably
gonna die of chafing.

19:04.622 --> 19:06.606
Pam also locked the ship
onto a course

19:06.708 --> 19:08.641
for the Fang Nebula.

19:08.743 --> 19:10.710
<i>[rapping]
♪ I am Wyoming, I am home! ♪</i>

19:10.812 --> 19:13.579
<i>♪ I am America,
I'm Teapot Dome! ♪</i>

19:13.681 --> 19:16.599
God, wow, that is
cask strength ear poison,

19:16.701 --> 19:18.668
but I'm still on the fence.

19:18.770 --> 19:19.997
Do you really want
to live the rest

19:20.004 --> 19:21.637
of your short life in a world

19:21.739 --> 19:22.932
where Cyril is cooler than you?

19:22.974 --> 19:24.874
We'll shoot the eggs into space.

19:24.976 --> 19:27.577
But only if you modify Benedict
so he stops laying eggs.

19:27.679 --> 19:29.912
He's my friend, and he's staying

19:30.014 --> 19:31.714
and I just realized
he's probably a she.

19:31.816 --> 19:33.624
There's no way for me
to know if I can even...

19:33.668 --> 19:35.601
He'll do it or he goes
in the recycler.

19:35.703 --> 19:36.869
But, wait.
What will we eat?

19:36.971 --> 19:38.871
I cobbled together a formula
from stuff on hand

19:38.973 --> 19:40.773
and the regenerative DNA.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.542
It should provide
enough nutrients

19:42.644 --> 19:43.609
to get us to spaceport.

19:43.711 --> 19:44.844
Really? Space goo?

19:44.946 --> 19:47.613
No! It's more of a slurry.

19:47.715 --> 19:49.765
Yeah, it's a goo.

19:52.637 --> 19:53.931
All right,
that's the last of them.

19:53.938 --> 19:56.639
- Took you long enough.
- Not engaging. Not engaging.

19:56.741 --> 19:58.708
Engage, MF-ers!

19:58.810 --> 20:00.776
You'll touch that button
when I say so.

20:00.879 --> 20:02.745
And guess what? I won't!

20:02.847 --> 20:04.680
How did you find us?

20:04.782 --> 20:06.782
Uh, I tapped into the
shipwide surveillance system.

20:06.834 --> 20:09.502
Which, by the way,
pretty pissed about!

20:09.604 --> 20:10.965
Look, we've got to get
rid of these eggs,

20:10.972 --> 20:12.705
and everything will go back
to normal.

20:12.807 --> 20:14.540
- No!
- Screw normal!

20:14.642 --> 20:16.719
You think I like being
a courtesan on a salvage ship?

20:16.778 --> 20:18.644
I have a post graduate degree!

20:18.746 --> 20:21.847
- What's it called? A Ph. Dong?
- That's what they call it!

20:21.950 --> 20:24.567
I just want to do nothing
and be happy

20:24.669 --> 20:25.868
and not get yelled at!

20:25.970 --> 20:27.703
And I'm good at being a captain!

20:27.805 --> 20:30.706
I want to take some initiative
without this ding dong.

20:30.808 --> 20:31.841
- Hey!
- Not you!

20:31.943 --> 20:33.843
Doing his stupid plans!

20:33.945 --> 20:36.913
So, what I'm hearing is,
you want Archer to be nicer

20:37.015 --> 20:39.665
or alternatively,
we can die in space

20:39.767 --> 20:41.801
as previously discussed.

20:41.903 --> 20:43.569
I'm thinking.

20:43.671 --> 20:44.704
Ow, fine!

20:44.806 --> 20:46.806
Jesus, your knuckles
are like filberts!

20:46.908 --> 20:48.808
Well, don't worry about
food, because...

20:48.910 --> 20:50.710
Yeah.
Space goo.

20:50.812 --> 20:52.778
Aww, my moment.

20:54.782 --> 20:55.910
What did you use to make it?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.633
Human waste and garbage?

20:57.735 --> 20:58.768
Hmm, not just that.

20:58.870 --> 21:00.569
Okay, I'm back on the egg side.

21:00.672 --> 21:01.704
Seriously? What about...

21:01.806 --> 21:02.805
Wow! Okay.

21:02.907 --> 21:03.906
That is powerful!

21:04.008 --> 21:05.641
Cork it, electro-nuts!

21:07.011 --> 21:08.978
Whew.
Look, we're all happy.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.913
Yes, maybe it's a shortcut,

21:11.015 --> 21:12.915
but don't we deserve
that once in a while?

21:13.001 --> 21:15.635
Isn't it nice
just to be together?

21:15.737 --> 21:17.003
To not worry about the future?

21:17.105 --> 21:20.773
Call it an intermezzo,
but maybe it's worth it?

21:20.875 --> 21:22.742
Oh, that was beautiful.

21:22.844 --> 21:25.811
But no, I will not gorge myself
on a highly addictive substance

21:25.913 --> 21:27.067
while we drift into a war zone

21:27.115 --> 21:28.948
while listening to
a shitty rock musical.

21:29.050 --> 21:31.734
Because it's insane,
and we will die!

21:33.972 --> 21:35.838
- Seize her!
- No, no, no, no...

21:37.709 --> 21:38.841
Wait!
Hey, guys.

21:38.943 --> 21:41.711
Remember when you were happy?

21:42.981 --> 21:44.780
No!

21:51.739 --> 21:53.034
- Why did you do that?
- It turns out the eggs

21:53.041 --> 21:54.907
did unleash my deepest desire.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.976
It's to make you all miserable.

21:58.946 --> 22:00.746
<i>Warning!
Unknown vessel approaching!</i>

22:00.848 --> 22:02.715
Cyril! What did we say
about the scanner,

22:02.817 --> 22:03.899
you colossal turd!

22:04.002 --> 22:06.035
Hey, you said
you'd be nicer to me!

22:06.137 --> 22:08.037
- I never agreed to that!
- Yes, you did!

22:08.139 --> 22:10.072
I obviously didn't mean it,
Lana!

22:12.944 --> 22:15.878
Well, we're all gonna die.
Thanks, Lana!

22:15.980 --> 22:17.079
How is this my fault?

22:17.181 --> 22:20.099
I don't know,
but it feels good to say that!

22:20.201 --> 22:22.835
<i>Hey, guys, it's Captain Brett!</i>

22:22.937 --> 22:24.904
Yeah, I've been tracking
you guys for a while,

22:25.006 --> 22:27.740
and I thought you guys
might need some supplies.

22:29.143 --> 22:31.105
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
How do we know it's Brett?

22:31.112 --> 22:32.878
<i>Ooh, hold on guys.</i>

22:32.980 --> 22:35.047
<i>I'm getting something weird
on my scanner here.</i>

22:35.149 --> 22:36.966
Yeah, what are those?

22:37.068 --> 22:38.934
<i>Oh, no. No, no!</i>

22:39.037 --> 22:40.770
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

22:40.872 --> 22:42.905
<i>Nooo!</i>

22:52.050 --> 22:54.066
Yep, uh, that was Brett.

23:15.907 --> 23:21.077
<i>Made in Georgia.</i>
