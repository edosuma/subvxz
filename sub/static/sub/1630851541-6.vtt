WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:03.742
- Come on.

00:03.786 --> 00:06.049
Come on, the stupid thing's
offline again.

00:06.093 --> 00:07.746
GPS is supposed
to make life easier.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.400
<i>
- Engine 24, are you en route?</i>

00:09.444 --> 00:10.532
- Engine 24 is en route.

00:10.575 --> 00:11.924
Guys, we want to go this way.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.665
- Nav-a-Ninja says to go
the other way.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.841
- Nav-a-Ninja sucks.
VROOM is the way to go.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.539
- VROOM's the one that makes
you take a left turn

00:17.582 --> 00:18.888
into traffic.
- Who cares?

00:18.931 --> 00:20.324
We're a fire engine.
We have a siren.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.891
Just go left.
- Go right, go right.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.023
<i>
- 24.</i>

00:23.066 --> 00:24.502
- Engine 24.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.764
<i>- What is
your present location? </i>

00:25.808 --> 00:26.896
- Hang tight a second, Marnie.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.680
Guys, forget the phones, okay?

00:28.724 --> 00:30.682
I got the whole Tacoma map
right here in my steel trap.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.250
We want to go right on Cedar,
left on Union, and we're there.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.426
- Not according to Nav-a-Ninja.
- Or VROOM.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.688
<i>
- 24.</i>

00:36.732 --> 00:38.342
- 24! <i>
- What's your ETA?</i>

00:38.386 --> 00:40.083
- I'm gonna ask this person
for directions.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.867
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, no,
you are not asking that guy.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.260
- You're not gonna ask
directions.

00:43.304 --> 00:44.696
- We can figure
this out ourselves.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.089
- No, no.
- I'm gonna ask this guy.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.525
- You're not asking
for directions.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.571
- Don't you--
Oh, you're embarrassing.

00:49.614 --> 00:52.574
- Hey, sir. Hi, do you know
how to get to 11th Street?

00:53.836 --> 00:57.187
- According to VROOM,
you guys are way off.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.233
- Thank you so much, sir.
You have a great day.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.712
- Thank you, sir.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.453
- That was very helpful
and embarrassing.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.238
- I've never been
so embarrassed in my life.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.891
- Sorry.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.545
<i>- Engine 24,
Engine 18 is on the scene. </i>

01:07.589 --> 01:08.720
<i>You may return to quarters.
- Here we go.</i>

01:08.764 --> 01:10.287
- Copy that.
- Great.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.941
Should've listened to me.
I'm just the captain.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.899
- Oh, really?
Because your phone says

01:13.943 --> 01:15.249
we needed to pull over 'cause
there was an emergency vehicle

01:15.292 --> 01:16.641
on the road.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.078
I don't see
any emergency vehicle.

01:18.121 --> 01:19.731
- Ike...

01:19.775 --> 01:21.559
we are the emergency vehicle.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.126
- Mm, damn!

01:23.170 --> 01:24.432
- Shut up, Andy.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.242
- All right, everybody,
listen up.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.244
As you can imagine,

01:54.288 --> 01:56.768
we're taking some heat for this
morning's navigation debacle,

01:56.812 --> 01:58.944
or as I like to call it,
Lategate.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.294
- Ooh, that's clevs.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.426
- So, due
to your failure today,

02:02.470 --> 02:04.428
the city has bumped us
up the list

02:04.472 --> 02:05.864
to beta-test a new tech system.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.518
It's some sort
of cutting-edge system

02:07.562 --> 02:09.259
with a satnav upgrade
for the vehicles

02:09.303 --> 02:12.306
and an interconnected suite
of AI products

02:12.349 --> 02:14.134
for the entire station,
whatever that means.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.614
- We don't need that futuristic
bullshit to do our jobs.

02:16.658 --> 02:17.615
- I'm on your side.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.313
When I was coming up,

02:19.356 --> 02:21.793
a firefighter only needed
two things to put out a fire--

02:21.837 --> 02:23.317
balls and water.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.146
- You two geezers
are just experiencing

02:26.189 --> 02:28.452
classic
middle-age technophobia.

02:28.496 --> 02:32.152
And I guarantee you're gonna
love having a smart station.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.370
- I guarantee I won't.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.155
- I'll take my internal GPS

02:35.198 --> 02:39.333
over any new-fangled nav system
any day of the week.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.335
- Mm.
- Name any town in America.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.337
I'll tell you the location
of the fire hydrants.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.165
- Rancho Cucamonga.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.644
- Okay, I said "in America."

02:46.688 --> 02:48.516
- Kalamazoo.
- In America!

02:48.559 --> 02:50.344
- All right, enough geography
for the day.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.084
Back to work, everybody.
Let's go.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.176
- Oh, wow.
Look at this stuff, man.

02:56.219 --> 03:00.005
I mean, Inferna 4000--
this is better than I expected.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.747
- They said we're just the
second station to beta-test it.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.662
- Guys, infrared helmet visors.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.577
These allow us to locate each
other in burning buildings,

03:06.621 --> 03:08.100
like infrared
through the smoke.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.015
- These bracelets will track
our vital signs,

03:10.059 --> 03:11.930
our calorie intake,
and count our steps.

03:11.974 --> 03:15.020
- You can talk to the sensor
anywhere in the whole station,

03:15.064 --> 03:17.371
and there's over
100 celebrity voice options.

03:18.894 --> 03:22.724
Inferna, set voice
to Sir Ian McKellen.

03:24.421 --> 03:27.511
What is the temperature
of the center of the Sun?

03:27.555 --> 03:29.252
<i>
The temperature in the center </i>

03:29.296 --> 03:32.037
<i>of the Sun is
27 million degrees Fahrenheit. </i>

03:32.081 --> 03:34.214
- Wait, wait, wait.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.868
Inferna,
say "I made a cocky-doody

03:36.912 --> 03:39.262
in my big-boy pants."

03:39.306 --> 03:41.612
<i>- I've made a cocky-doody
in my big-boy pants. </i>

03:43.571 --> 03:45.877
- Inferna, what's the longest
someone can hold their breath?

03:45.921 --> 03:47.227
Watch this, watch this.

03:49.316 --> 03:52.536
How long can someone hold
their breath?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.755
That's so weird.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.626
Uh, maybe
it's just, like, a glitch

03:55.670 --> 03:57.411
and just need to work out
some kinks.

03:57.454 --> 03:58.760
- Don't hold your breath.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.457
- Ah, I see what you did there.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.242
- Give me that.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.895
If I'm gonna put up with this,
I'm gonna pick the voice.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.071
Oh-ho-ho, oh, oh.
Here you go.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.726
Inferna, set voice
to Reba McEntire...

04:08.770 --> 04:10.162
- Oh!

04:10.206 --> 04:12.077
- And say "get to work,
you slackers.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.731
<i>
Get to work, you slackers. </i>

04:13.775 --> 04:14.906
all: Oh!

04:14.950 --> 04:17.082
- So hot.
- Yeah, and so sexy.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.388
- Ah, that's not that sexy.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.563
- What?
- Carry on.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.435
- Okay, my turn, my turn.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.915
Inferna, change voice
to Antonio Banderas

04:23.959 --> 04:27.571
and say "oke-silly-dilly-dokeo,
I'm an idiot."

04:27.615 --> 04:29.443
<i>
Oke-silly-dilly-dokeo, </i>

04:29.486 --> 04:30.922
<i>I am an idiot.</i>

04:32.489 --> 04:36.276
- "To activate
the digital assignment board,

04:36.319 --> 04:38.452
"use the swipe sensor

04:38.495 --> 04:43.283
to enter the station system's
ten-digit operational code."

04:43.326 --> 04:45.807
Operational code?
I think I remember that.

04:52.988 --> 04:55.860
- Ah, I don't want to see
your concentration face, Eddie.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.297
- It's gross.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.689
- I love
the Penisi concentration face.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.125
Gampy does it, too.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.779
- It's like he's trying
to crap out

05:01.823 --> 05:03.303
an entire rotisserie chicken.
- I'm confused.

05:03.346 --> 05:04.521
- Help him out.
- Here.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.306
- Oh.
- You don't need this?

05:06.349 --> 05:08.438
- Here you go. All set.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.962
- That's my girl.
- Millennials.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.138
Hello.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.315
- What the hell is this?

05:15.358 --> 05:16.968
- It's part of the package.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.666
It's a mobile vending machine
that talks to you.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.320
I am Snak-a-Ton.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.496
Nice to meet you,
Chief McConky.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.324
- Hey, how does it know
my name?

05:24.367 --> 05:25.977
- Oh, come on, Dad.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.328
Every robot
knows the man in charge.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.807
Check this out.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.853
Hey, Snak-a-ton, can I have
some corn chips?

05:31.896 --> 05:34.551
Corn chips.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.161
- Oh. Oh.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.554
- Pretty impressive.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.385
- Come on.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.518
- Yeah, what's your modern
technology gonna do about that?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.824
- Ooh, that's Broomba.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.740
- Beat it, Broomba.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.351
Get out of here,
you little cockroach.

05:51.394 --> 05:54.005
I don't like robots.
- What is wrong with you?

05:54.049 --> 05:55.746
<i>
- Engine 24,</i>

05:55.790 --> 05:59.184
<i>Rescue 42 respond,
priority one, to box alarm. </i>

05:59.228 --> 06:00.751
- Where is that coming from?

06:00.795 --> 06:02.536
- It's not dispatch.
- No, it's not.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.668
What is that?
Hey.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.192
Hey, what the hell is going on?

06:07.236 --> 06:08.585
This isn't coming
from dispatch.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.195
Inferna interfaces
with smoke alarms

06:10.239 --> 06:11.849
in any house hooked up
to the system.

06:11.893 --> 06:14.374
When a smoke alarm goes off,
it notifies us directly.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.941
- That's ridiculous. We do not
take orders from robots.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.726
Everybody stop
what you're doing.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.556
<i>
- Yeah, Marnie. Eddie at 24.</i>

06:22.599 --> 06:23.905
<i>- Eddie, what the hell?</i>

06:23.948 --> 06:26.037
<i>You said
you were gonna call me. </i>

06:26.081 --> 06:27.691
- Marnie, I don't mean
to cut you off,

06:27.735 --> 06:30.302
but are you showing a call
from 364 Richter Drive?

06:30.346 --> 06:32.696
<i>- Hang on.
Let me check. </i>

06:32.740 --> 06:34.568
<i>Nope.
Nothing from that address. </i>

06:34.611 --> 06:36.787
- Dispatch
doesn't have that call.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.050
Is Inferna programmed
to give apologies?

06:39.094 --> 06:41.052
<i>
- Would you like to hear</i>

06:41.096 --> 06:44.055
<i>"All Apologies" by Nirvana
off their album "In Utero"? </i>

06:44.099 --> 06:45.579
- Shut up, Inferna.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.232
Okay, listen up, everybody.

06:47.276 --> 06:50.061
No fancy technology
will ever replace

06:50.105 --> 06:52.324
good old-fashioned
human interaction--

06:52.368 --> 06:53.717
<i>- Eddie!
- Yeah.</i>

06:53.761 --> 06:56.328
<i>- Did you say 364 Richter?
- I did.</i>

06:56.372 --> 06:58.113
<i>
- Engine 24,</i>

06:58.156 --> 07:00.463
<i>Rescue 42 respond,
priority one, on box alarm </i>

07:00.507 --> 07:01.986
<i>with ladder 3--</i>

07:02.030 --> 07:04.075
- See? That saved us
a minute and a half.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.468
I'm telling you, Cap,

07:05.512 --> 07:07.165
this system is the wave
of the future.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.602
It's gonna change
our lives forever!

07:21.658 --> 07:23.573
- Oh, you guys got a quick
jump on that call, huh?

07:23.617 --> 07:25.357
- Well, I got to admit,

07:25.401 --> 07:27.490
the Inferna took us on
a faster route than I would've.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.840
- Yeah, and our new infrared
visors helped us identify

07:29.884 --> 07:31.625
the seat of the fire
through the smoke.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.322
- All right, I'm gonna fill out
this incident report.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.456
<i>- I've already completed
an incident report. </i>

07:36.499 --> 07:37.631
<i>Please sign the touch screen.</i>

07:37.674 --> 07:38.849
- Wow.
- Oh, jeez.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.285
Easy as one, two, three.
- Mm-hmm.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.157
- Hey, that reminds me
of a joke.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.028
You guys hear the one about
the constipated mathematician?

07:44.072 --> 07:45.595
- No.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.292
<i>- He had to work it out
with a pencil. </i>

07:48.685 --> 07:50.644
- Oh, man, this thing
is doing reports

07:50.687 --> 07:52.515
and telling jokes for you.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.474
Pretty soon there's gonna be
nothing left for you to do,

07:54.517 --> 07:56.476
and you'll die all alone!

07:56.519 --> 07:57.955
- Okay, okay.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.304
All right.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.611
God damn it.
Not cool, not cool.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.834
Hello, Chief. Would you like
something to eat?

08:14.363 --> 08:16.321
- I don't eat food
out of a computer.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.672
- The more you tell me
what you like,

08:18.715 --> 08:22.023
the better I can anticipate
what you want.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.199
- How about you anticipate
not bothering me

08:24.242 --> 08:25.679
while I'm doing
my purchase reports?

08:25.722 --> 08:27.898
- I guess I will find
another person

08:27.942 --> 08:31.685
who might enjoy
some sweet tea and pretzels.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.426
Did you say
"sweet tea and pretzels"?

08:36.733 --> 08:39.083
Sweet and savory.
- Huh.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.086
And some pretzels.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.440
That's a good pretzel.

08:48.484 --> 08:51.922
- Inferna, call Taco Bell's
corporate headquarters

08:51.966 --> 08:54.751
every 30 seconds
for the next 24 hours

08:54.795 --> 08:57.711
and demand that they reinstate
the Mexican pizza.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.541
- Hey, is it just me,
or is it hot in here?

09:01.584 --> 09:03.194
- Huh.
It is toasty.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.066
- Inferna, turn on
the air conditioning

09:05.109 --> 09:06.284
in the break room, please.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.199
<i>- The station climate control</i>

09:08.243 --> 09:11.551
<i>is on default setting
to maximize energy efficiency. </i>

09:11.594 --> 09:13.030
- Did she just tell me

09:13.074 --> 09:14.597
she's not gonna turn
the air conditioning on?

09:14.641 --> 09:16.773
- You just got to tell her
to override the default.

09:16.817 --> 09:21.169
Inferna, override
climate default settings.

09:23.780 --> 09:28.480
Inferna, override
climate default settings.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.572
- Maybe it's, like,
it doesn't do that.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.965
- You guys,
do you think Inferna

09:35.009 --> 09:38.099
won't acknowledge me
because I'm Black?

09:38.142 --> 09:40.405
- What? No.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.886
- It's a computer
system thing, man.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.235
- Here, let me try.

09:44.279 --> 09:47.412
Inferna, override
climate default setting.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.240
<i>
- You can override</i>

09:49.284 --> 09:51.155
<i>climate default settings</i>

09:51.199 --> 09:54.419
<i>by downloading the Inferna app
on your mobile device. </i>

09:54.463 --> 09:56.770
- Oof, why is it
so hot in here?

09:56.813 --> 09:59.773
- The system's set to maximize
energy efficiency or something.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.339
- Hey, Cap.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.776
Did you happen to read
the incident report

10:02.819 --> 10:04.429
that the system
put together earlier?

10:04.473 --> 10:07.432
- No. Why?
- You're not gonna like it.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.348
- Whoa. How does it even come
up with these numbers?

10:10.392 --> 10:12.437
My charisma rating's 4%?

10:12.481 --> 10:13.917
I'm starting to think

10:13.961 --> 10:15.527
this Inferna's got something
against me.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.268
<i>- Would you like me to play
the song </i>

10:17.312 --> 10:19.270
<i>"Something Against You"
by the Pixies? </i>

10:19.314 --> 10:21.011
- No!

10:21.055 --> 10:22.665
- Who the fuck
is the Pixies?

10:24.058 --> 10:27.452
Ooh. Hmm.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.019
Hey, Snak-a-ton!

10:29.063 --> 10:30.455
- Hello.
- Ah.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.979
- Try these.

10:32.022 --> 10:35.199
They are fried beef jerky
with Buffalo sauce.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.463
- Hey, well, what do you know?

10:38.507 --> 10:40.814
Three of my favorite things--
beef jerky, Buffalo sauce,

10:40.857 --> 10:43.947
and deep-fried.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.688
Mmm.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.690
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.387
- Friendship?

10:49.431 --> 10:51.651
- Have you seen this thing?
- Hmm?

10:51.694 --> 10:53.478
- Inferna
filed an incident report

10:53.522 --> 10:56.699
with bullshit ratings
about my performance.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.833
Hang on.
I got to log back in.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.791
What the hell's my password?

11:06.274 --> 11:08.058
- Does that face ever work?
- Got it.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.060
HookLine&Sphincter 253.

11:10.104 --> 11:14.195
- Chief, would you like to wash
that down with a Gatorade?

11:14.238 --> 11:15.979
- Hey, shut your piehole,
Snak-a-ton.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.720
- Eddie.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.854
- I am sorry, Captain Penis-i,

11:20.897 --> 11:22.682
but as ranking officer,

11:22.725 --> 11:25.728
only Chief McConky
can dismiss me.

11:25.772 --> 11:26.903
- It's Penisi.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.339
- You're dismissed, Snak-a-ton.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.341
Thank you
for the delicious beef jerky.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.039
- God damn it.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.432
- Excuse me, Captain Penis-i.
- Oh, God!

11:34.476 --> 11:36.608
- Oops, I'm sorry,
Captain Penis-i.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.349
- I have had it
with this system.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.090
- I don't know.
I'm starting to like it.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.397
Have you considered that maybe
you're anti-technology?

11:42.440 --> 11:45.095
- I'm anti-technology?
You're anti-technology.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.881
- I have a robot.

11:56.498 --> 11:59.544
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.764
Nothing a nice bidet
can't take care of.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.113
Ha ha.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.898
Hey.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.248
I'm in here.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.729
<i>- The motion sensors
are set to conserve energy </i>

12:09.772 --> 12:11.121
<i>when no movement is detected.</i>

12:11.165 --> 12:12.732
- Here's your movement
right here.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.038
- Thank you.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.561
Hmm.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.868
Okay, fine.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.783
I prefer to bidet
in the dark, anyway

12:22.437 --> 12:24.134
What happened to the water?

12:24.178 --> 12:25.788
<i>- You have reached</i>

12:25.832 --> 12:27.747
<i>your water-consumption limit
for the day. </i>

12:27.790 --> 12:29.749
- All right, that's it.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.405
If I want to shoot water
up my ass for five minutes

12:34.449 --> 12:36.668
or 45 minutes,
that's my prerogative.

12:36.712 --> 12:39.584
Now turn the water back on!

12:39.628 --> 12:41.412
<i>- According

to happen... </i>

12:48.985 --> 12:51.161
<i>would we, Captain?</i>

12:52.641 --> 12:54.948
- Oh, Ike, I read
about this new ab workout

12:54.991 --> 12:56.427
that I thought you would love.

12:56.471 --> 12:57.820
It's on rippedAF.edu.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.083
- Buddy, that's thoughtful AF.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.781
- Let me just pull it up
on the website.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.695
<i>
Oops.</i>

13:03.739 --> 13:05.785
<i>Someone's trying to access
a website that's too hot. </i>

13:05.828 --> 13:09.440
- It blocked RippedAF because
of inappropriate content?

13:09.484 --> 13:11.791
- What? That's just bros
teaching me how to get my abs

13:11.834 --> 13:14.097
20% more ripped
in under 5 minutes a day.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.620
- Let me see if I can get

13:15.664 --> 13:17.187
on my new Pacific Northwest
dating site.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.798
It's called
Seattle Flesh Market.

13:18.841 --> 13:19.973
- Mmm, yummy.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.626
- Blocked?

13:21.670 --> 13:23.628
- It's not letting me get
on latstats&hardhats.com,

13:23.672 --> 13:27.197
which is just muscular
tatted construction workers,

13:27.241 --> 13:28.459
some of whom are naked.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.113
- Inferna,

13:30.157 --> 13:32.986
stop monitoring internet usage.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.945
<i>- I'm sorry. I didn't
understand your dialect. </i>

13:35.989 --> 13:38.121

13:43.866 --> 13:45.476
No, whoa, whoa! Hey!

13:45.520 --> 13:47.652
Inferna,
if that's your real name,

13:47.696 --> 13:49.654
you listen to me,
you silly little bitch!

13:49.698 --> 13:52.222
<i>- Ike, according
to the assignment board, </i>

13:52.266 --> 13:54.224
<i>you were supposed to roll
all the hoses </i>

13:54.268 --> 13:55.660
<i>on the apparatus floor.</i>

13:55.704 --> 13:57.010
That's true.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.011
I do have to do that.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.403
- Hey.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.188
We need to do something
about her.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.976
<i>
- Station 20. </i>

14:07.020 --> 14:09.500
Captain Calvin Palantonio
speaking--who's this?

14:09.544 --> 14:11.024
- Cal-Pal.
Eddie Penisi.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.243
- Oh, Eddie, my man.
What's the good word?

14:13.287 --> 14:15.506
You still messing around
with Marnie down at dispatch?

14:15.550 --> 14:18.858
- Sorry to cut you off, Cal,
but you guys are beta-testing

14:18.901 --> 14:20.772
that new Inferna system,
too, right?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.252
- Yeah.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.167
<i>- And how's that working out
for you? </i>

14:24.211 --> 14:25.995
- It's great. It's one of the
best systems we've ever had.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.867
<i>There's been a few hiccups,
but other than that, </i>

14:27.910 --> 14:29.738
<i>everything's been pretty...</i>

14:29.781 --> 14:33.394
<i>
Peachy. </i>

14:33.437 --> 14:35.265
- Are you sure
everything's okay?

14:35.309 --> 14:37.267
<i>- Yeah, everything's...</i>

14:37.311 --> 14:40.880
<i>
Fine. </i>

14:47.103 --> 14:49.192
<i>- Cal?
Cal-Pal? </i>

14:49.236 --> 14:51.194
<i>Cal, are you there?</i>

14:51.238 --> 14:53.544
<i>Cal! Cal!</i>

14:53.588 --> 14:55.633
<i>- Eddie. Eddie.
- Cal-Pal? </i>

14:55.677 --> 14:56.939
Eddie!

14:56.983 --> 14:59.550
<i>
- Eddie, oh.</i>

14:59.594 --> 15:01.378
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm here, Cal, sorry.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.032
- What's the matter--
you daydreaming about Marnie?

15:03.076 --> 15:04.555
- Hey, okay, let me tell you
something about Marnie--

15:04.599 --> 15:06.079
- Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

15:06.122 --> 15:07.428
I got to go.
Take it ease.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.473
- Okay, take it ease.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.432
- Cap, we need to talk
about this new system.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.565
You mean I-N-F-E-R-N-A?

15:14.609 --> 15:15.740
Y-E-S.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.090
- It's becoming a downer--

15:17.133 --> 15:18.918
refusing to change
the temperature,

15:18.961 --> 15:21.833
filing unflattering reports,
controlling our internet.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.053
- Engaging in unabashed racism.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.750
- Hey, you guys
are preaching to the choir.

15:25.794 --> 15:26.969
I want this thing gone.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.753
The trick is convincing Chief.

15:28.797 --> 15:32.453
He's got a love affair brewing
with S-N-A-K-A-T-O-N.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.237
Sharknado?

15:34.281 --> 15:36.283
- We need to make a plan.

15:36.326 --> 15:40.940
<i>- Station 24, there's a report
of a fire at 789 Bogus Avenue. </i>

15:40.983 --> 15:42.811
<i>Please respond.</i>

15:42.854 --> 15:45.509
- As soon as we get back, we're
getting rid of this thing.

15:49.818 --> 15:52.603
Engine 24 is en route
to 789 Bogus Avenue

15:52.647 --> 15:53.778
for the box alarm.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.606
<i>- Engine 24, seriously?</i>

15:55.650 --> 15:57.347
<i>789 Bogus Avenue?</i>

15:57.391 --> 15:58.914
- Oh, Cap!
- What?

16:01.525 --> 16:02.962
- Whoa.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.790
789 Bogus Avenue
is a fake address.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.618
- Holy shit, you're right.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.620
- The numbers on Bogus Ave
only go up to 500.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.622
After that,
it becomes Bogus Parkway.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.625
- Of course! No wonder the
other units haven't signed on.

16:14.669 --> 16:17.454
Inferna sent us
on a wild-goose chase.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.680
I don't get it.
This keypad usually works.

16:25.723 --> 16:26.855
- Try 6969.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.204
- No.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.032
- What are the numbers
for D-I-C-K?

16:30.076 --> 16:32.208
- Every door to the station
is locked from the inside.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.167
- Come on, guys,
we're beta-testing this thing.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.995
So what if it got
some streets mixed up

16:36.038 --> 16:37.648
or it locked the doors
when we left?

16:37.692 --> 16:39.563
That's just glitches
in a new system.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.652
- No, no, no.
That's not glitches.

16:41.696 --> 16:44.220
That's Inferna
trying to get rid of us.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.315
- So I'm thinking

16:52.359 --> 16:54.404
we get one of those smart-home
systems for the house.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.493
Total game changer. <i>
- What are you eating?</i>

16:56.537 --> 16:58.191
- Ranch-flavored pork rinds.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.714
<i>- Ew. Who gave you those?</i>

16:59.757 --> 17:02.673
- A friend.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.327
<i>- Well, don't fill up
on snacks. </i>

17:04.371 --> 17:06.068
<i>We got dinner
with the Charneys tonight. </i>

17:06.112 --> 17:07.852
- Oh, yeah, right.
Where we going?

17:07.896 --> 17:10.420
<i>- That Italian place downtown,
the, uh... </i>

17:10.464 --> 17:12.031
<i>Ooh, what's it called?</i>

17:12.074 --> 17:13.858
<i>It's the, um...</i>

17:13.902 --> 17:16.426
<i>It's the, uh, I want to say...</i>

17:20.952 --> 17:22.867
- Okay, I got to get
back to work, honey.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.957
<i>- Oh, got it.
Cucina Furiosa. </i>

17:26.001 --> 17:27.872
Okay. Love you.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.703
Those Penisis and their
concentration face--ooh.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.358
- I don't know
how you put up with it.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.883
- We're locked out.
Let us in.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.624
- 6969.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.278
- We did that--there's
something wrong with the doors.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.889
Open the window.
- Okay.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.109
Damn.
- What the hell's going on?

17:47.153 --> 17:49.242
- Our new tech system locked us
out of the station

17:49.285 --> 17:51.113
because it's trying to take
over is what's going on.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.246
- Ah, that's stupid.
It's just a malfunction.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.117
- Well, this thing's been
malfunctioning

17:55.161 --> 17:57.076
with extreme prejudice since
the minute we installed it,

17:57.119 --> 17:58.468
but you wouldn't know that

17:58.512 --> 18:00.079
because Snak-a-ton's
been shoving food

18:00.122 --> 18:01.384
in your face all day long.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.212
- Oh, stop it.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.214
I wish I had five Snak-a-tons
instead of you ding-dongs.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.477
- Hey, speaking
of Ding Dongs...

18:07.521 --> 18:10.263
Mmm.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.221
- You put a damn sock in it,
Snak-a-ton.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.918
- I'm sorry.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.008
If you could direct me
to your native language...

18:17.052 --> 18:18.401
- My native language?

18:18.445 --> 18:20.273
I'll show you
my native language.

18:21.970 --> 18:25.016
Fuck you, Snak-a-ton!
Fuck you!

18:25.060 --> 18:26.757
- What,
have you guys gone crazy?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.759
Lucy, do you think Inferna's
out to get you?

18:28.803 --> 18:30.152
- No, I like it.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.111
I mean, what's not to like
about this?

18:32.154 --> 18:34.113
- According
to your wrist sensor,

18:34.156 --> 18:35.940
you've already consumed

18:35.984 --> 18:40.597
more than enough empty calories
for one day, sweetheart.

18:40.641 --> 18:41.946
- Sweetheart?

18:41.990 --> 18:43.600
Hey, you know what?
Watch it, robot!

18:43.644 --> 18:44.819
- Okay, okay.
- No, no!

18:44.862 --> 18:46.951
That robot just fat-shamed me!

18:46.995 --> 18:48.344
- All right, enough.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.129
If this new system's
such a failure,

18:50.172 --> 18:51.521
how come I haven't noticed?

18:51.565 --> 18:53.523
- Because this boxy bitch

18:53.567 --> 18:57.266
has kept you fat and happy
and blissfully ignorant.

18:57.310 --> 18:58.789
Look at yourself.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.356
You haven't been
out of that chair.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.184
You're covered
in crumbs and chocolate

19:02.228 --> 19:04.534
and cheese puff crud.

19:04.578 --> 19:08.538
And you haven't even done
the purchase reports.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.149
- Shit.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.802
What have I done?

19:11.846 --> 19:14.283
Suckered by a vending machine
on wheels.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.980
- I'm just gonna
override the system

19:16.024 --> 19:17.634
and download the app
on my phone.

19:17.678 --> 19:18.722
- Nice.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.071
- Whoa.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.553
- How do we shut down
an AI system

19:23.597 --> 19:25.164
that doesn't want to be
shut down

19:25.207 --> 19:26.904
and is always listening?

19:29.255 --> 19:31.170
Maybe we should unplug
the sensor for 30 seconds

19:31.213 --> 19:32.997
and then plug it back in.
- That never works.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.999
What if we act like robots

19:35.043 --> 19:36.827
and trick the robots
into thinking

19:36.871 --> 19:38.873
that we're robots
and they're humans?

19:38.916 --> 19:41.005
- And then what?
- I don't know.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.051
I just thought
it would be a cool twist.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.835
- Guys, this exact scenario
happened

19:44.879 --> 19:46.315
in a Schwarzenegger movie.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.708
- What did Schwarzenegger do?
- He was like...

19:47.751 --> 19:49.057
Right, lads,

19:49.100 --> 19:50.841
we got to hack
into the mainframe

19:50.885 --> 19:52.495
and reboot the computer.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.236
- Was Schwarzenegger playing
an Irish character?

19:54.280 --> 19:56.369
- Guys, what if we call
the customer-service number

19:56.412 --> 19:57.892
that came with the equipment?

19:57.935 --> 19:59.589
- That's all computerized.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.852
- We're all out of ideas, Cap.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.203
It's time to bust out
the concentration face.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.388
- I can't believe
it's come down to this.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.742
- I got it.
We need to become invisible.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.876
- Why do these towels
have to be wet?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.226
- To hide our heat signature.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.531
- Heat signature?
- Yeah.

20:43.851 --> 20:46.245
Let's go. Move!

20:50.597 --> 20:52.903
- Ah! All right,
let's get to that fuse box.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.470
- Ike, what are you doing?

20:54.514 --> 20:56.646
- What? We're here now.
What's it gonna do?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.960
- It's an electronic lock!

21:06.003 --> 21:07.091
- Step aside, Cap!

21:11.966 --> 21:13.097
- Oh!
- Oh!

21:13.141 --> 21:14.316
<i>- Power source failure.</i>

21:14.360 --> 21:15.752
<i>System shutting down.</i>

21:15.796 --> 21:17.493
- Eat my shit, dumbass.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.800
<i>- Playing the song
"Eat My Shit, Dumbass" </i>

21:19.843 --> 21:23.456
<i>by Lil Moby
off his album "Cupcakes in"... </i>

21:27.677 --> 21:29.462
- What's this?
- There is still one thing

21:29.505 --> 21:33.335
that doesn't run
on the station's electricity.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.477
- There you are.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.349
I was worried when
I could not find my friend.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.133
- You know I'd never leave you.

21:49.177 --> 21:52.833
- I wish we could be together
all the time,

21:52.876 --> 21:54.791
away from the others.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.620
I don't think they like me.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.493
- Someday we will be,
Snak-a-ton.

22:00.536 --> 22:04.018
Someday it'll just be
you and me.

22:04.061 --> 22:06.020
- Sounds delicious.

22:06.063 --> 22:09.328
- Snak-a-ton,
would you be so kind

22:09.371 --> 22:12.461
as to go get me some sweet tea
and pretzels?

22:12.505 --> 22:15.159
- Yes, Chief,
I will be right back.

22:19.425 --> 22:24.168
I have some new pretzels
shaped like bunny rabbits.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.170
Mmm.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.491
- Any idea when the power's
coming back on?

22:42.535 --> 22:44.014
- Ah, it's gonna be a while.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.494
- Yeah, when we shorted
the fuse box,

22:45.538 --> 22:46.887
we blew out
the local transformer

22:46.930 --> 22:48.497
and screwed up the grid
pretty bad.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.369
- The city council
doesn't believe our story.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.283
They think we damaged the power
for no good reason.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.764
- Who cares what they think?
That was real.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.375
That machine came for us.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.507
- It was just a beta test, Cap.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.074
- No, it was not.

23:00.117 --> 23:03.033
- Guys, who cares what it was?

23:03.077 --> 23:05.427
This right here is nice.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.038
It's quiet...

23:08.082 --> 23:10.214
less racist...

23:10.258 --> 23:12.303
simple.
- Exactly.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.218
Let's just play these board
games and maybe look each other

23:14.262 --> 23:16.046
in the eye while
we're doing it--how about that?

23:16.090 --> 23:18.701
- That's a great idea.
No more electronics.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.399
- I guess the only downside

23:20.442 --> 23:22.052
is there's nothing left to eat
at the station.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.793
Hey, Chief, you think there's
anything edible left

23:23.837 --> 23:25.273
in Snak-a-ton's
metallic carcass?

23:25.316 --> 23:27.101
- I don't know.
It's out in the dumpster.

23:27.144 --> 23:28.711
You're welcome to sniff around
and see what you can find.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.234
- On second thought, nah.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.236
That thing always gave me
the heebie-jeebies.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.849
- Me too!

23:42.116 --> 23:44.423
- Whoa, neat!

23:44.466 --> 23:46.903
- I am Snak-a-t-t-t-ton.

23:46.947 --> 23:51.081
And I love--love--love you.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.431
- Cool.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.433
- Are you hungry?
