00:00.093 --> 00:03.137
What's up, Marloneers?
Welcome to "The Marlon Way."

00:03.138 --> 00:05.656
Growing up, I had a lot of brothers.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.910
I was damn near born
into a fraternity.

00:07.911 --> 00:10.579
I was hazed my entire life.

00:10.580 --> 00:12.880
My brothers would lick my food.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.754
Hey, my cookie tastes like spit!

00:18.755 --> 00:21.524
It was rough, but see, the thing was,

00:21.525 --> 00:23.225
my brothers was always there for me.

00:23.226 --> 00:26.462
And when I went to college,
I missed that brotherhood.

00:26.463 --> 00:28.998
And then I met Stevie,

00:28.999 --> 00:31.966
and he was always there.

00:32.968 --> 00:35.004
See, they're fast and furious.

00:36.439 --> 00:37.773
Which one is this?

00:37.774 --> 00:39.708
Boy, would you stop being there?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:49.085 --> 00:50.085
Marlon!

00:53.322 --> 00:55.524
The guys are gonna be here any minute.

00:55.525 --> 00:58.894
I hope you brought a jacket,
because it's chilly in D.C.

00:58.895 --> 01:00.963
Girl, I got eight party outfits,

01:00.964 --> 01:04.132
six after-party outfits,
and I ain't covering up

01:04.134 --> 01:07.001
Nair-one of 'em with a damn jacket.

01:07.803 --> 01:09.638
- 14 outfits?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09.639 --> 01:11.941
Girl, we're only going
for the weekend.

01:11.942 --> 01:14.977
This is Howell homecoming.
I don't know what to expect.

01:14.978 --> 01:17.680
Y'all all had
that black college experience.

01:17.681 --> 01:19.615
Homecoming is a blast.

01:19.616 --> 01:21.350
You get to catch up with old friends

01:21.351 --> 01:24.486
over wine and cheese and jazz.

01:27.390 --> 01:29.525
Girl, I'm 'sleep.

01:29.526 --> 01:31.560
I'm trying to day party, night party,

01:31.561 --> 01:33.963
after party, and be
on somebody's shoulders

01:33.964 --> 01:35.431
at the Migos concert.

01:35.432 --> 01:37.099
Oh...

01:37.100 --> 01:38.534
Yvette,

01:38.535 --> 01:40.703
I'm not gonna be
one of those pathetic old-heads

01:40.704 --> 01:43.538
running around homecoming
acting a fool.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.575
HU!

01:46.576 --> 01:50.446
Fo' sho!

01:50.447 --> 01:52.347
OK!

01:53.082 --> 01:54.849
Yeah, we... we don't do that.

01:56.619 --> 01:58.187
I'm so excited, you guys,

01:58.188 --> 02:00.022
that we're all going back
for homecoming.

02:00.023 --> 02:02.324
Oh, I love going back to homecomings!

02:02.325 --> 02:04.793
I like going just to see
how terrible people look.

02:04.794 --> 02:05.928
Oh, my God.

02:05.929 --> 02:07.529
On our 20th, this girl came up to me.

02:07.530 --> 02:09.497
She said, "Marlon!

02:09.499 --> 02:10.799
You was in my class!"

02:10.800 --> 02:12.501
I said, "Which one did you teach?"

02:14.604 --> 02:15.838
Oh, my God.

02:15.839 --> 02:17.306
But this is a special year.

02:17.307 --> 02:20.776
This is the 25th anniversary
of the Drew Cows,

02:20.777 --> 02:23.646
the fraternity I founded
in my underwear

02:23.647 --> 02:25.713
while eating a bowl of Lucky Charms.

02:26.649 --> 02:27.883
Wait, so you're the one who started

02:27.884 --> 02:30.552
- that stupid cow fraternity?
- Yup.

02:30.553 --> 02:32.288
And, you know, I should have started

02:32.289 --> 02:34.323
another one for all the farm animals,

02:34.324 --> 02:36.358
so this way, you and your horsehair

02:36.359 --> 02:37.593
could have joined.

02:37.594 --> 02:39.795
'Cause that weave you got is hi...

02:39.796 --> 02:42.197
lar...

02:42.198 --> 02:43.931
ious.

02:44.767 --> 02:47.169
I didn't want to be a part
of those big frats,

02:47.170 --> 02:48.537
so I started the Cows.

02:48.538 --> 02:49.672
Drew Cows!

02:49.673 --> 02:52.341
Moo!

02:52.342 --> 02:54.310
And this year, the original Cows

02:54.311 --> 02:56.111
are coming back
to pledge the new line.

02:56.112 --> 02:57.513
Well, Stevie, why aren't you mooing

02:57.514 --> 02:59.481
like your ass got stuck
with a cattle prod?

02:59.482 --> 03:02.251
Sadly, I was never allowed to pledge.

03:02.252 --> 03:04.887
- Mm.
- Marlon always had my back.

03:04.888 --> 03:07.189
But the other founding fathers,
Eddie and Dwayne,

03:07.190 --> 03:09.058
didn't think that I was "leather."

03:09.059 --> 03:11.225
That's what they call "Cow material."

03:12.494 --> 03:13.662
Not being a Cow is still one

03:13.663 --> 03:14.863
of the biggest regrets of my life.

03:14.864 --> 03:16.931
Well, that and cheap Lasik.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.468
And never trying out
for "The Lion King."

03:19.469 --> 03:21.303
And missing the "Frasier" finale.

03:21.304 --> 03:22.838
I don't know how it ended.

03:22.839 --> 03:24.639
So many regrets.

03:25.207 --> 03:28.242
And so many reasons why they
didn't let you in the frat.

03:28.944 --> 03:30.579
- I mean, well,
- if you guys didn't meet

03:30.580 --> 03:33.215
in Drew Cows, how did you
even become friends?

03:33.216 --> 03:36.151
Well, when I first got to HU, uh,

03:36.152 --> 03:40.122
my grades was
a little bit subpar, per Se.

03:40.123 --> 03:42.091
The only "A" I had was in partying.

03:42.092 --> 03:44.793
So I called Rent-A-Nerd.

03:44.794 --> 03:46.294
And I picked right up.

03:47.062 --> 03:48.797
Of all the people that I tutored,

03:48.798 --> 03:50.632
Marlon was the only one
who took me to parties.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.901
You could say I helped him
with classes...

03:52.902 --> 03:56.204
And I helped him with asses.

03:57.272 --> 03:58.741
Okay.

03:58.742 --> 04:00.242
Kids, come on down!

04:00.243 --> 04:02.745
Hey, we can reminisce
about the good old days

04:02.746 --> 04:04.913
- when we get to campus.
- Ah!

04:04.914 --> 04:07.182
Why do we have to stay at Grandma's?

04:07.183 --> 04:10.152
Every meal, she tells us
a story about segregation.

04:10.153 --> 04:14.055
I don't know who Jim Crow is,
but he did a number on Grandma.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.964
Oh, look at all this black excellence!

04:21.964 --> 04:24.099
I never felt more at home.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.701
I don't know, you looked pretty cozy

04:25.702 --> 04:27.168
in the Laker locker room.

04:27.703 --> 04:29.571
Come on, Yvette, I'll show you around.

04:29.572 --> 04:32.141
Okay. Whoo!

04:32.142 --> 04:33.475
Pastor Daddy would have been

04:33.476 --> 04:35.878
Pastor Granddaddy if he sent me here.

04:35.879 --> 04:38.514
Come on!

04:38.515 --> 04:40.416
This is where our friendship began.

04:40.417 --> 04:41.850
Not to be too sentimental,

04:41.851 --> 04:44.686
but I'd like to take
this opportunity to say...

04:44.687 --> 04:46.855
Drew Cows!

04:46.856 --> 04:48.290
Moo!

04:48.291 --> 04:50.626
My man Itchy Eddie,

04:50.627 --> 04:51.894
look at you!

04:51.895 --> 04:53.362
Remember why we called you
Itchy Eddie?

04:53.363 --> 04:56.398
'Cause you got poison ivy
and crabs all at the same time!

04:57.600 --> 04:59.334
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Marlon!

04:59.335 --> 05:00.903
- Look at you!
- What's up, man?

05:00.904 --> 05:03.672
Skinny D ain't so skinny no more, man!

05:03.673 --> 05:05.140
Look at you, boy!

05:05.141 --> 05:07.443
Hey, man, why didn't you
invite me to the baby shower?

05:07.444 --> 05:08.777
Ah!

05:08.778 --> 05:10.846
- Marlon still got jokes, man!
- Yeah, man!

05:10.847 --> 05:13.015
And pants so tight,
you can see his sperm count!

05:13.016 --> 05:13.916
Oh!

05:13.917 --> 05:15.451
Hey... hey, we ain't got
to worry about that,

05:15.452 --> 05:16.819
'cause I just use your condom hat!

05:16.820 --> 05:18.654
Is this thing ribbed and lubricated?

05:18.655 --> 05:20.856
Oh, hey!

05:20.857 --> 05:24.460
Stevie! AKA Nerdy Noggle!

05:24.461 --> 05:26.361
Eddie and Dwayne.

05:26.362 --> 05:28.697
Howell's least likely to succeed.

05:28.698 --> 05:30.466
I own my own trucking company.

05:30.467 --> 05:32.768
Well, that's why
the "likely's" in there.

05:32.769 --> 05:35.671
Allows for a certain margin of error.

05:35.672 --> 05:37.573
Hey, yo, Stevie, check it out.

05:37.574 --> 05:39.241
We came here to pledge some Calves,

05:39.242 --> 05:40.943
so why don't you find
your old glee club buddies

05:40.944 --> 05:44.146
and you guys can whack it
to the "Hamilton" soundtrack?

05:46.282 --> 05:47.816
I'll catch you later, dog!

05:47.817 --> 05:49.685
Hey, fellas, I believe it's that time.

05:49.686 --> 05:51.620
Bring in the bighead pledges!

05:51.621 --> 05:53.355
Big Brothers!

05:53.356 --> 05:55.991
I present to you
this year's Cow pledges.

05:58.628 --> 06:00.596
I love the smell of...

06:00.597 --> 06:02.798
Leather in the morning.

06:02.799 --> 06:06.233
Hey, hold up.
I thought we was pledging five.

06:07.402 --> 06:08.904
Pledges!

06:08.905 --> 06:10.706
Greetings, Big Brothers
of Drew Cow Fraternity,

06:10.707 --> 06:12.074
not incorporated!

06:12.075 --> 06:13.774
We're here to serve!

06:15.577 --> 06:19.013
What in the midlife crisis is this?

06:25.600 --> 06:27.372
What is this, some kind of joke?

06:27.373 --> 06:29.668
Man, let me tell you,
you are disrespecting

06:29.669 --> 06:31.269
all the distinguished gentlemen

06:31.270 --> 06:33.038
that had that bell before you.

06:33.039 --> 06:35.574
I'm talking about legends,
like... like Dingleberry

06:35.575 --> 06:39.077
and Moose-Knuckle and... and Lil Stink

06:39.078 --> 06:41.146
and Lil Stink Stink, Jr.

06:41.147 --> 06:43.749
No relation, by the way.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.150
This is no joke, Marlon.

06:45.151 --> 06:46.451
I reached out
to the current Cow president

06:46.452 --> 06:48.086
and asked him to pledge.

06:48.087 --> 06:49.788
I've been waiting 25 years
to prove to Eddie and Dwayne

06:49.789 --> 06:51.923
what you and I have always known.

06:51.924 --> 06:54.192
That you pull your pants
all the way to the floor

06:54.193 --> 06:55.794
when you take a pee at the urinal?

06:55.795 --> 06:57.362
It's weird, okay?

06:57.363 --> 06:58.997
Look at this... grown-ass man

06:58.998 --> 07:00.898
just sitting there like this.

07:03.402 --> 07:04.970
This looks weird, Stevie!

07:04.971 --> 07:06.905
It looks weird!

07:06.906 --> 07:08.506
Okay?

07:10.709 --> 07:12.511
That I have what it takes to be a Cow.

07:12.512 --> 07:14.146
Stevie, you don't understand.

07:14.147 --> 07:16.348
This pledge process is brutal, man.

07:16.349 --> 07:18.784
And Eddie and Dwayne
are not gonna take it easy

07:18.785 --> 07:20.018
on you, and neither can I.

07:20.019 --> 07:22.888
- Oh, I can handle it.
- How?

07:22.889 --> 07:26.725
Boy, you got the stamina
of Aretha Franklin.

07:26.726 --> 07:28.026
You've actually used

07:28.027 --> 07:29.628
the motorized scooter
in the supermarket!

07:29.629 --> 07:32.130
Those are for everybody!

07:32.131 --> 07:33.832
This is important to me, Marlon.

07:33.833 --> 07:37.001
- I'm finally gonna be a Cow.
- Stevie...

07:38.336 --> 07:41.106
- Girl, you should wear this
on the booze cruise tonight.

07:41.107 --> 07:43.108
Girl, I already told you
I'm not playing with these kids

07:43.109 --> 07:44.609
this weekend.

07:44.610 --> 07:48.246
- What's going on, cuties?
- Hey!

07:48.247 --> 07:49.748
Girl, please tell me y'all are coming

07:49.749 --> 07:51.415
on the booze cruise tonight.

07:52.451 --> 07:54.118
Hell yeah!

07:57.155 --> 07:58.490
Bye!

08:04.931 --> 08:06.431
Calves!

08:06.432 --> 08:08.233
I would like to formally introduce you

08:08.234 --> 08:10.202
to our founding fathers.

08:10.203 --> 08:12.771
Big Brother Itchy-E!

08:12.772 --> 08:14.372
Moo-moo!

08:14.373 --> 08:16.441
Big Brother Skinny-D!

08:16.442 --> 08:17.609
Moo-moo, homey.

08:17.610 --> 08:19.111
And the honorable...

08:19.112 --> 08:20.579
Big Brother Spot Blower.

08:20.580 --> 08:23.447
♪ Moo-moo-moo-moo-moo-moo

08:25.050 --> 08:29.620
Being a Cow requires a strong mind.

08:31.289 --> 08:34.893
'Cause we about to break you down.

08:34.894 --> 08:37.229
We about to fondle your brain.

08:37.230 --> 08:40.432
We gonna grope your mind.

08:40.433 --> 08:43.335
We gonna molest your psyche.

08:43.336 --> 08:45.971
Now, all y'all 18, right?

08:45.972 --> 08:48.406
Okay, cool.

08:48.407 --> 08:50.075
Look at this new meat right here!

08:50.076 --> 08:52.077
Boy, you stink.

08:52.078 --> 08:53.812
You smell like...

08:53.813 --> 08:55.714
You smell like the wave cap
on a prisoner

08:55.715 --> 08:57.616
that's serving life!

08:57.617 --> 08:59.551
Oh, you smell like

08:59.552 --> 09:01.686
one of them baby dogs
when they six weeks old

09:01.687 --> 09:04.623
and you can't wash 'em.

09:04.624 --> 09:06.525
Oh, you smell mildewy.

09:06.526 --> 09:09.060
You smell like clothes
that you didn't finish drying

09:09.061 --> 09:11.530
but then wore to the gym
and started stinking.

09:13.266 --> 09:17.502
Oh, you smell like floss string
after Thanksgiving dinner

09:17.503 --> 09:19.670
six years ago!

09:20.672 --> 09:22.407
Oh, you smell like

09:22.408 --> 09:24.876
a cat burglar's hat

09:24.877 --> 09:26.711
after he committed a lot of crimes

09:26.712 --> 09:29.681
and climbed tall, tall buildings.

09:29.682 --> 09:32.916
Skyscrapers in Dubai.

09:33.585 --> 09:36.587
Man, you damn near 50 years old.

09:37.522 --> 09:39.391
Hey, guys, we're pledging

09:39.392 --> 09:41.993
one of the Tuskegee Airmen!

09:41.994 --> 09:43.962
Hey, what's up
with this busted-ass Afro?

09:43.963 --> 09:47.098
Who are you, Cornell East?

09:47.099 --> 09:48.567
You find something funny?

09:48.568 --> 09:50.135
With all due respect, Big Brother,

09:50.136 --> 09:51.903
I've been friends with Marlon
for over two decades!

09:51.904 --> 09:54.539
He's called me a lazy-ass,
no-sex-having parasite!

09:54.540 --> 09:56.440
And that was in my birthday card.

09:57.642 --> 09:58.944
I don't know what color you are.

09:58.945 --> 10:00.345
You're confusing me!

10:00.346 --> 10:02.247
I don't know what you are, you...

10:02.248 --> 10:04.849
What are you, cake batter?

10:04.850 --> 10:07.519
Lemon pepper?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.820
Off-Drake?

10:11.056 --> 10:13.291
So you still friends with Marlon, huh?

10:13.292 --> 10:14.826
He's my best friend, Big Brother!

10:14.827 --> 10:17.395
Well, here's the question:
how come your best friend

10:17.396 --> 10:19.064
never wanted you in the Drew Cows?

10:19.065 --> 10:21.366
He did! You two kept blocking me!

10:22.568 --> 10:25.302
Yo, he still don't know!

10:26.037 --> 10:27.839
Hey, hey, guys, look at...

10:27.840 --> 10:28.840
look at Fetus Face!

10:28.841 --> 10:30.208
Hey, hey, Fetus Face,

10:30.209 --> 10:31.943
we gotta put yo' face
back in the incubator

10:31.944 --> 10:34.079
to let it finish developing!

10:34.080 --> 10:36.514
Hey, it was unanimous, bro.

10:36.515 --> 10:40.452
Now, we all agreed.
You were never Cow material.

10:40.453 --> 10:42.419
Even Marlon.

10:43.588 --> 10:45.123
Marlon, is this true?

10:45.124 --> 10:47.525
Um, well, it... it all depends

10:47.526 --> 10:49.527
on what you mean by "true."

10:49.528 --> 10:51.696
I mean a statement of fact.

10:51.697 --> 10:53.865
As in something
that actually happened.

10:53.866 --> 10:56.134
Are you talking
"my girl checked my cell phone,

10:56.135 --> 10:58.303
so I gotta admit it" true?

10:58.304 --> 11:00.972
Uh, then...

11:00.973 --> 11:03.574
I-I guess yes.

11:04.709 --> 11:06.009
It's true.

11:08.907 --> 11:11.123
Calves, we're taking you
to a muddy field

11:11.124 --> 11:12.224
for some cow tipping!

11:12.225 --> 11:13.592
By the way, you the cows!

11:13.593 --> 11:15.526
And it ain't all mud!

11:16.161 --> 11:19.397
Pledges, stampede!

11:21.667 --> 11:23.669
You've been lying to me for 25 years.

11:23.670 --> 11:25.571
You knew how much
I wanted to be a Cow!

11:25.572 --> 11:27.606
- How could you block me?
- Because I didn't want you

11:27.607 --> 11:29.441
going through the torture
of initiation!

11:29.442 --> 11:31.910
- Why the hell not?
- Dude, you remember you

11:31.911 --> 11:33.779
freshman year. Come on, man!

11:33.780 --> 11:35.213
You was soft and corny.

11:35.214 --> 11:36.981
Look, you still corny!

11:37.583 --> 11:39.284
Dude, you used to drag
your books behind you

11:39.285 --> 11:40.652
in a rollaway backpack.

11:40.653 --> 11:42.054
I didn't know
if you was going to class

11:42.055 --> 11:44.188
or taking a damn red-eye.

11:45.190 --> 11:47.359
I was trying to protect you, Stevie.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.128
Oh, you had to protect me?
Like I'm some sort of child?

11:50.129 --> 11:52.930
You still wear superhero underwear!

11:54.232 --> 11:56.134
And make noises
and fly around the house

11:56.135 --> 11:58.303
going, "Pssh!"

12:00.306 --> 12:03.075
Well, you don't need to
"protect" me anymore, Marlon.

12:03.076 --> 12:04.943
I'm gonna prove to them and you

12:04.944 --> 12:06.778
that I do have what it takes.

12:06.779 --> 12:10.115
In fact, you don't need
to protect me ever again.

12:10.116 --> 12:12.618
When we get back to LA,
I'm moving out.

12:12.619 --> 12:13.952
Oh, really? Dude, I was just

12:13.953 --> 12:15.520
- looking out for you!
- I don't need you

12:15.521 --> 12:17.089
to look out for me anymore, jackass!

12:18.758 --> 12:20.626
You gonna cuss folks?

12:20.627 --> 12:22.060
Did you hear that, Moo-Moo?

12:22.061 --> 12:24.028
Stevie's cussin' folks!

12:25.664 --> 12:27.566
All right, listen up, Calves!

12:27.567 --> 12:30.268
From here on out,
it's gonna be pure hell.

12:30.269 --> 12:33.804
And some of you ain't gon' make it.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.310
And I'm not talking
to anyone in particular...

12:38.311 --> 12:39.744
Stevie.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.749
- Serve 'em up!
- You have two minutes

12:43.750 --> 12:45.984
to find the bottom
of this bowl of raw beef.

12:45.985 --> 12:47.551
Hands behind your back.

12:48.086 --> 12:49.620
Begin!

12:50.989 --> 12:52.391
You ain't gon' be able
to eat this, Stevie,

12:52.392 --> 12:54.826
'cause I didn't buy it for you!

12:54.827 --> 12:56.494
Oh, I'm gonna eat it.

12:57.129 --> 12:58.897
If I'm not part
of the clean plate club,

12:58.898 --> 13:00.365
I don't get dessert.

13:03.636 --> 13:05.070
All right, two Calves

13:05.071 --> 13:07.439
have already been sent off
to the pasture.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.541
Only three remain.

13:09.542 --> 13:12.477
All Calves will stand
with this milk on their backs

13:12.478 --> 13:14.212
for the next five hours.

13:14.213 --> 13:17.281
You do that, you become Cows.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.851
Terrence Howard down there
ain't gon' last ten minutes.

13:22.921 --> 13:24.723
Hey.

13:24.724 --> 13:26.625
Do me a favor.

13:26.626 --> 13:29.260
Y'all text me when he goes down.

13:38.637 --> 13:40.639
OMG, Marlon.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.873
I've been looking for you!

13:41.874 --> 13:44.176
Your whole frat is Snapchatting

13:44.177 --> 13:45.477
about how you blocked Stevie

13:45.478 --> 13:47.112
from becoming a Cow back in the day.

13:47.113 --> 13:48.513
WTF?

13:48.514 --> 13:51.649
Girl, did you just hop out
of a DeLorean?

13:52.284 --> 13:53.552
You better hurry up
and get the plutonium

13:53.553 --> 13:56.020
before Zack and Marley disappear.

13:57.022 --> 13:58.957
Why would you block him?

13:58.958 --> 14:01.960
Come on, you knew Stevie
back in the day, Ashley.

14:01.961 --> 14:03.928
The boy was soft and delicate.

14:04.930 --> 14:07.232
I had to protect his weak ass.

14:07.233 --> 14:09.434
Now he's talking about moving.
Where you gonna go,

14:09.435 --> 14:11.735
from our couch to the loveseat?

14:13.271 --> 14:16.174
Marlon, let me ask you something.

14:16.175 --> 14:18.710
When your grandmother was sick,

14:18.711 --> 14:20.078
who was there for you?

14:20.079 --> 14:22.346
My grandpa and his girlfriend?

14:24.249 --> 14:25.817
All right.

14:25.818 --> 14:28.153
And Stevie.

14:28.154 --> 14:29.888
And?

14:29.889 --> 14:31.389
And he drove me from LA to New York

14:31.390 --> 14:34.392
because he knew
I couldn't afford a ticket.

14:34.393 --> 14:36.528
- And?
- And...

14:36.529 --> 14:38.764
he got speeding tickets in six states.

14:38.765 --> 14:40.499
- And?
- He's still wanted

14:40.500 --> 14:43.368
in Illinois.

14:43.369 --> 14:45.270
- And!
- I had to pay

14:45.271 --> 14:47.038
for the damn tickets!

14:47.039 --> 14:50.008
But!

14:50.009 --> 14:53.145
But my grandma was happy to see me.

14:53.146 --> 14:56.548
Now, maybe I'm wrong AF.

14:56.549 --> 14:59.217
But it sounds to me
like you haven't always

14:59.218 --> 15:00.951
been the strong one.

15:02.387 --> 15:03.722
Check it.

15:03.723 --> 15:06.324
So Shane just slid into my DMs,

15:06.325 --> 15:09.394
inviting us to his dorm
for a beach party!

15:09.395 --> 15:11.096
Girl, we gotta bounce!

15:11.097 --> 15:12.430
Okay!

15:14.967 --> 15:16.468
Oh, hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

15:16.469 --> 15:18.436
- Marlon.
- Yeah.

15:18.437 --> 15:21.807
- You gon' be all right?
- Yeah.

15:21.808 --> 15:23.975
I'll be okay. But...

15:23.976 --> 15:25.944
I'm concerned about you two.

15:25.945 --> 15:29.781
I mean, between the crow's-feet
and the bubblegum lip gloss,

15:29.782 --> 15:31.917
girl, y'all look like T-L-Senile.

15:33.786 --> 15:35.719
Don't go chasing Geritol.

15:43.269 --> 15:45.132
Calf down, two heifers to go.

15:47.802 --> 15:49.303
Stevie!

15:49.304 --> 15:50.737
I need to talk to you!

15:50.738 --> 15:52.439
Well, I guess you came here

15:52.440 --> 15:54.641
to watch me fall,
prove that you were right.

15:54.642 --> 15:57.477
Well, I'll have you know, sir,

15:57.478 --> 15:58.478
your time is impeccable.

15:58.479 --> 15:59.947
It's about to happen.

15:59.948 --> 16:01.481
You're damn right
it's about to happen.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.550
I got them Life Alert people
on standby.

16:03.551 --> 16:05.252
Smart, smart.

16:05.253 --> 16:06.753
Your weak ass is breathing

16:06.754 --> 16:08.488
like your contractions
are two minutes apart.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.157
Stevie, listen.

16:10.158 --> 16:12.125
I was wrong about you back in the day.

16:12.126 --> 16:13.193
I didn't know you well enough.

16:13.194 --> 16:15.596
But you know what? You a Cow material!

16:15.597 --> 16:18.265
Come on, now, Marlon,
you cannot be serious.

16:18.266 --> 16:20.434
Eddie, I know you ain't talkin'.

16:20.435 --> 16:22.469
The only reason why you became a Cow

16:22.470 --> 16:24.805
was because you were too scared
to join a real frat.

16:24.806 --> 16:27.941
Yeah, one hit with that paddle,
and you was ready

16:27.942 --> 16:29.977
to join a sorority.

16:33.281 --> 16:35.548
I know you ain't laughin', Skinny-D.

16:35.983 --> 16:38.518
Yeah, the only reason
why your ass became a Cow

16:38.519 --> 16:40.153
is 'cause you wasn't pretty enough

16:40.154 --> 16:41.521
to join the pretty boy frat!

16:41.522 --> 16:43.657
Yeah, they said you had a pretty face

16:43.658 --> 16:46.058
but you had a body
like a wounded orangutan!

16:47.661 --> 16:49.162
What happened to all those dreams

16:49.163 --> 16:50.631
of becoming a model, huh?
What kind of model

16:50.632 --> 16:52.898
you gon' be, a Lane Bryant model?

16:53.533 --> 16:54.868
Come on, guys.

16:54.869 --> 16:56.470
Let's be real.

16:56.471 --> 16:58.472
We started this fraternity
because we was

16:58.473 --> 17:00.641
a bunch of misfits.

17:00.642 --> 17:03.109
We didn't fit in anywhere.

17:03.677 --> 17:06.146
And then a year later,
Stevie comes along

17:06.146 --> 17:07.847
and we act all brand-new?

17:08.848 --> 17:13.987
Yes, he was a scrawny,
nerdy half-a-virgin.

17:13.988 --> 17:16.454
Your tone does not match your words.

17:18.492 --> 17:21.560
My point is,
this man is a lot stronger

17:21.561 --> 17:24.498
than any of us give him credit for.

17:24.499 --> 17:26.133
Okay, listen, when I got jumped

17:26.134 --> 17:28.902
outside of Drew Hall,
who stood their ground with me?

17:28.903 --> 17:31.405
It wasn't you, Eddie.
Your ass ran off,

17:31.406 --> 17:33.038
and you started the fight!

17:34.007 --> 17:36.476
And what you shakin'
your head at, Skinny-D?

17:36.477 --> 17:38.245
You didn't help either!
Ol' big-ass brother

17:38.246 --> 17:39.713
ain't got no fighting skills.

17:39.714 --> 17:42.615
How you leave HU 0-52?

17:44.051 --> 17:46.386
The only one that stood
their ground with me

17:46.387 --> 17:47.554
was Stevie.

17:47.555 --> 17:49.189
Now, did he get his ass whupped?

17:49.190 --> 17:51.491
Yes, mercilessly.

17:51.492 --> 17:53.427
Ten years of tae Kwon do.

17:53.428 --> 17:54.561
They didn't know they were supposed

17:54.562 --> 17:56.897
to come at me one at a time.

17:56.898 --> 18:00.434
If anybody deserves
to be in this brotherhood,

18:00.435 --> 18:02.501
it's this man right here.

18:04.404 --> 18:07.074
Think that's the only reason
I started this thing.

18:07.075 --> 18:09.109
I guess I always wanted
to be your brother.

18:09.110 --> 18:10.877
Come on, man. Hey.

18:10.878 --> 18:13.947
You've been my brother for 25 years.

18:13.948 --> 18:16.116
And I don't need no stupid initiation

18:16.117 --> 18:17.451
to prove that.

18:17.452 --> 18:18.719
Come on, man, take this thing off.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.387
No. No, I've come

18:20.388 --> 18:22.255
way too far, Marlon. I'm gonna finish.

18:22.256 --> 18:24.091
You sure?

18:24.092 --> 18:25.759
Well, then you really want
to take that off,

18:25.760 --> 18:28.962
because uh, your time been up
about 45 seconds ago.

18:28.963 --> 18:31.064
What?

18:31.065 --> 18:32.799
Yeah, I was really feeling the speech.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.034
It was moving,
you know what I'm saying?

18:34.035 --> 18:36.803
Like, I got after-school-special bumps

18:36.804 --> 18:38.472
on the back of my neck.
It was feeling good.

18:38.473 --> 18:41.908
Okay, ring the bell!

18:41.909 --> 18:45.112
Congratulations, Calves!

18:45.113 --> 18:48.115
- You're now...
- Drew Cows!

18:48.116 --> 18:50.951
Moo!

18:53.287 --> 18:56.456
Presenting Stephandre Noggle

18:56.457 --> 18:59.159
and Dustin...

18:59.160 --> 19:02.496
I-I don't know your last name
'cause, Negro,

19:02.497 --> 19:06.166
I ain't think you was gon' make it...

19:06.167 --> 19:08.635
as newest members of the Drew Cows,

19:08.636 --> 19:11.138
not incorporated.

19:11.139 --> 19:13.273
And from here on out,

19:13.274 --> 19:16.977
I want to announce
there will be no more grazing.

19:16.978 --> 19:19.846
If you want to join the Cows,

19:19.847 --> 19:22.315
all you have to do is share with us

19:22.316 --> 19:23.683
your misfit status

19:23.684 --> 19:27.887
and/or your ability to catch chicks.

19:28.455 --> 19:29.856
Drew Cows!

19:29.857 --> 19:32.325
Moo!

19:32.326 --> 19:36.095
Moo! Moo! Moo!

19:37.464 --> 19:39.231
Shh!

19:40.267 --> 19:41.802
Shh!

19:43.504 --> 19:45.872
What the hell happened to you two?

19:45.873 --> 19:47.707
Uh...

19:47.708 --> 19:50.844
yeah, we went
with some fraternity, uh,

19:50.845 --> 19:52.646
- gentlemen...
- Mm-hmm.

19:52.647 --> 19:55.649
To the Campbell Hall Beach Party.

19:55.650 --> 19:58.685
And we partied
like we were 19 years old.

19:58.686 --> 20:00.720
Which we are definitely not.

20:00.721 --> 20:03.190
Wait, so y'all were with
the Campbell Cougars?

20:03.191 --> 20:05.859
- The Campbell Cougars?
- Yeah.

20:05.860 --> 20:07.327
It's the job

20:07.328 --> 20:09.196
of every Campbell pledge
to bring the hottest moms

20:09.197 --> 20:11.931
they can find to the
homecoming beach party.

20:13.200 --> 20:17.003
Campbell Cougars!

20:17.004 --> 20:18.771
So mean.

20:19.806 --> 20:22.075
The hottest cougars?

20:22.076 --> 20:24.777
Well, you know what? I'll take it.

20:25.579 --> 20:28.748
And, Yvette, I want
to thank you for pushing me.

20:28.749 --> 20:31.852
I thought I was gonna feel
like an old-head, but...

20:31.853 --> 20:33.553
it felt good turning back the clock

20:33.554 --> 20:35.055
- this weekend.
- Aww.

20:35.056 --> 20:37.123
And I finally got

20:37.124 --> 20:40.060
the black college experience.

20:40.061 --> 20:42.328
Drew Cows!

20:44.331 --> 20:47.067
You know!

20:47.068 --> 20:48.867
Moo!

20:53.240 --> 20:55.242
Drew Cow!

21:00.514 --> 21:02.215
Hey!

21:05.019 --> 21:06.786
Hey!

21:06.787 --> 21:13.581
