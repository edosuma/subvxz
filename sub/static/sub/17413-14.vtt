WEBVTT

00:07.911 --> 00:09.711
Great rehearsal, Austin.

00:09.713 --> 00:11.246
Maybe I should do it again.

00:11.248 --> 00:13.281
This show has gotta be perfect.

00:13.283 --> 00:15.617
I'm streaming it live to
all my international fans.

00:15.619 --> 00:18.787
Relax. You practiced each
song like 100 times.

00:18.789 --> 00:20.455
I'm even getting tired
of hearing 'em.

00:20.457 --> 00:21.923
And I wrote 'em.

00:21.925 --> 00:24.793
Well, I don't care how many
times I hear those songs.

00:24.795 --> 00:26.728
They still give me goose bumps.

00:26.730 --> 00:29.398
No, wait. That's
a mosquito bite.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.899
Or is it a freckle?

00:30.901 --> 00:33.668
Oh, it's chocolate.

00:34.670 --> 00:36.872
So, Trish, what did Jace think?

00:36.874 --> 00:42.711
Well, either he cheered so hard his
face got stuck, or our my-taps froze.

00:42.713 --> 00:44.713
Well, let me help.

00:44.715 --> 00:49.618
Just go into settings, switch off the
wi-fi, configure your VPN... uh...

00:49.620 --> 00:51.253
<i>Hey, Trish!</i>

00:51.255 --> 00:53.989
Or you could just do that.

00:53.991 --> 00:55.957
You sounded killer, Austin.

00:55.959 --> 00:59.694
Thanks, man. I don't usually
let people watch me practice.

00:59.696 --> 01:00.996
Oh, I hear you.

01:00.998 --> 01:03.265
The last time I let Trish
watch me practice skating,

01:03.267 --> 01:05.300
I broke my arm in three places.

01:05.302 --> 01:06.802
So, Jace, what's going on?

01:06.804 --> 01:08.069
We haven't talked all week.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.272
Ah, sorry. I've just
been busy with work.

01:10.274 --> 01:12.841
But, hey... we just shared
our first concert together.

01:12.843 --> 01:14.476
Well, at least the part I saw.

01:14.478 --> 01:17.612
Which was mostly Dez crying
through "I think about you."

01:18.881 --> 01:21.416
Well, excuse me for
having a heart.

01:21.418 --> 01:23.518
Come on, Austin.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.040
Let's go check out those lights
I'm setting up for your concert.

01:27.290 --> 01:31.026
Look, I know this whole
long-distance thing is hard,

01:31.028 --> 01:36.264
but it's moments like these that
make me realize just how...

01:36.266 --> 01:37.599
You froze again, didn't you?

01:37.601 --> 01:39.935
Jace! Jace!

01:39.937 --> 01:43.305
Jace!

01:43.307 --> 01:47.776
Why can't I have a normal relationship
where we watch movies, share milkshakes

01:47.778 --> 01:49.277
and give each other
shoulder rubs?

01:49.279 --> 01:50.612
I'm sorry.

01:50.614 --> 01:52.948
But, hey! I can give
you a shoulder rub.

01:52.950 --> 01:54.649
Where does it hurt?

01:54.651 --> 01:56.284
- Here?
- Ow!

01:56.286 --> 01:59.054
Well, now it does.

02:00.523 --> 02:02.757
Oh, I forgot to tell you guys...

02:02.759 --> 02:04.926
my cousin Dwyane invited us
over to his house tomorrow.

02:04.928 --> 02:06.828
He's a huge Austin moon fan.

02:06.830 --> 02:09.830
I don't know. I really need
the time to rehearse more.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.067
Come on! He's been begging
me forever to meet you.

02:12.069 --> 02:13.969
He thinks I'm the
coolest guy ever.

02:13.971 --> 02:15.637
Can you blame him?

02:15.639 --> 02:18.006
Ow. Ow.

02:18.008 --> 02:20.008
We should go, Austin.

02:20.010 --> 02:22.043
You need a break, and
it could be fun.

02:22.045 --> 02:25.747
Oh, yeah! Hanging out with a
guy who thinks Dez is cool.

02:25.749 --> 02:28.383
Sounds like a blast.

02:28.385 --> 02:30.685
Okay, fine, we'll go
for a little bit.

02:30.687 --> 02:32.954
I do owe you for helping
me set up these lights.

02:32.956 --> 02:36.091
Ah, great! Hey, I want to make sure
the spotlight hits you perfectly.

02:36.093 --> 02:38.627
I'm not sure if you should
stand here or here.

02:43.599 --> 02:46.868
Yeah, I think I should
stand way over there.

02:49.606 --> 02:52.007
You know what... we
don't need spotlights.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:52.168 --> 03:53.969
Whoa!

03:53.971 --> 03:56.538
Your cousin's house is nice.

03:59.076 --> 04:01.176
Cool, his doorbell
plays "heartbeat"!

04:01.178 --> 04:03.078
That's a little weird.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.813
I told you, he's a big fan.

04:06.749 --> 04:10.018
Welcome. I'm bogues,
Dwyane's assistant.

04:10.020 --> 04:13.088
Enter at your own risk.

04:14.090 --> 04:15.790
Seriously, I just
waxed the floors.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.692
They're very slippery.

04:20.730 --> 04:23.064
Whoa, this place is awesome.

04:23.066 --> 04:24.466
Dwyane is in the great room.

04:24.468 --> 04:26.668
Are you children
into video games?

04:26.670 --> 04:30.538
Uh, does the average iceberg
weigh 200,000 tons?

04:32.008 --> 04:33.108
It does.

04:33.110 --> 04:34.643
Had to look it up for geology.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.515
Dwyane, your guests
have arrived.

04:43.953 --> 04:46.621
Austin, it is great to finally meet you.
I'm a big fan.

04:46.623 --> 04:50.091
Dwyane Wade?!

04:50.093 --> 04:51.198
Dwyane Wade's your cousin?

04:51.229 --> 04:55.597
Technically, he's my half-second-
cousin-in-law, twice removed, but, yeah.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.831
Don't you see the resemblance?

04:58.968 --> 05:00.235
Not really.

05:00.237 --> 05:01.870
Well, I thought you knew.

05:01.872 --> 05:03.938
Duh! Dez Wade.

05:03.940 --> 05:07.108
They used to call me "d. Wade" when I
was a kid, but he stole it from me.

05:07.110 --> 05:08.476
It's true.

05:08.478 --> 05:10.078
I'm freaking!

05:10.080 --> 05:11.780
You're my favorite n.B.A.
Player.

05:11.782 --> 05:13.048
I never miss a heat game.

05:13.050 --> 05:15.216
Since when are you
a basketball fan?

05:15.218 --> 05:17.986
I'm not, but I'm a
Dwyane Wade fan.

05:17.988 --> 05:19.220
He's so cute.

05:19.222 --> 05:21.656
It's true.

05:21.658 --> 05:22.824
I can't believe it.

05:22.826 --> 05:24.959
Austin moon is
actually at my house.

05:24.961 --> 05:26.995
You have no idea what
a huge fan I am.

05:26.997 --> 05:30.999
Well, the shirt and the
doorbell gave us a decent idea.

05:31.001 --> 05:32.901
Say "pancake!"

05:32.903 --> 05:34.569
Pancake!

05:34.571 --> 05:37.038
It's really cool
to chill with you.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.146
I'm a really big fan too.

05:38.177 --> 05:41.242
Listen, if you guys need anything,
bogues will take care of you.

05:41.244 --> 05:44.245
Oh, I'll definitely
take care of them.

05:48.651 --> 05:51.119
I'd fire that guy, but
I'm scared of him.

05:52.021 --> 05:53.655
Listen, make yourself at home.

05:53.657 --> 05:54.956
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

05:54.958 --> 05:57.726
Oh, you're bilingual too?

05:59.963 --> 06:02.897
<i>Yeah, I only know the
"mi casa" thing.</i>

06:02.899 --> 06:05.800
Hey, you guys wanna
play "disco explosion"?

06:05.802 --> 06:08.069
- Yeah!
- "Disco explosion"?

06:08.071 --> 06:10.071
That's my favorite dance game.

06:10.073 --> 06:13.074
Oh, man, I left my red
disco boots at home.

06:13.076 --> 06:15.316
Guess I'll just have to settle
for my orange disco boots.

06:18.248 --> 06:20.849
Let's pick our avatars.

06:20.851 --> 06:22.650
I get to be Austin.

06:22.652 --> 06:25.086
I didn't know they made an
Austin moon avatar in this game.

06:25.088 --> 06:27.088
Oh, they don't. I made it.

06:29.325 --> 06:31.826
Nothing weird about that.

06:31.828 --> 06:33.995
You guys ready?
You're going down.

06:33.997 --> 06:35.964
<i>Oh, it's on.</i>

06:35.966 --> 06:37.866
Oh, you're both going down.

06:39.602 --> 06:42.604
Don't you think Dwyane seems
more than just a big fan?

06:42.606 --> 06:44.906
It's like he's
obsessed with Austin.

06:44.908 --> 06:48.143
<i>You're right... Dwyane is cute.</i>

06:48.145 --> 06:51.913
That's not what I... forget it.

06:51.915 --> 06:53.748
There's something a
little off here.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.172
I'm gonna have a look around.

06:55.203 --> 06:58.753
Well, while you're off solving the
case of the paranoid songwriter,

06:58.755 --> 06:59.754
I'm gonna call Jace.

06:59.756 --> 07:01.689
You really miss him, huh?

07:01.691 --> 07:04.259
No, I'm gonna brag that I'm
at Dwyane Wade's house.

07:10.099 --> 07:11.699
Trish, I'm so
excited you called.

07:11.701 --> 07:12.834
Guess where I'm...

07:12.836 --> 07:14.169
but I gotta go. Bye.

07:16.006 --> 07:18.840
He just hung up on me.

07:18.842 --> 07:20.708
I don't know what's
going on with us.

07:20.710 --> 07:21.876
This is insane.

07:21.878 --> 07:24.045
I know. We were cool
like a week ago.

07:24.047 --> 07:25.613
No, look at this book.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.084
"Austin in wonderland"?

07:30.086 --> 07:32.754
Dwyane changed all these famous
books to make them about Austin.

07:33.957 --> 07:36.691
"Austinberry finn."

07:38.127 --> 07:41.062
"The austinback of notre dame"?

07:41.064 --> 07:42.964
I don't think it's insane.

07:42.966 --> 07:45.166
It's creative.

07:45.168 --> 07:46.868
You're just blinded
by your crush.

07:46.870 --> 07:48.870
I don't have a crush.

07:48.872 --> 07:51.005
My heart belongs to
what's-his-face.

07:51.007 --> 07:52.173
Jace?

07:52.175 --> 07:53.741
Right, him.

07:53.743 --> 07:55.643
Okay, let's go look around.

08:02.052 --> 08:04.118
Whoo! I win again.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.955
I still can't believe I'm
playing video games...

08:06.957 --> 08:07.964
with Austin moon.

08:07.995 --> 08:11.926
I still can't believe we played 37
games without taking a bathroom break.

08:11.928 --> 08:14.929
Mr. d. Wade, it's time for
your phone interview.

08:14.931 --> 08:17.031
I have a phone interview?

08:17.033 --> 08:19.934
No. The famous d. Wade.

08:19.936 --> 08:22.237
Aw, man. I gotta go.

08:22.239 --> 08:24.105
Well, it was great
hanging out, cuz.

08:25.407 --> 08:28.710
I guess we'll just grab Ally
and Trish and head out.

08:28.712 --> 08:30.778
No no, you guys can't leave.

08:30.780 --> 08:32.413
I got a whole night
of fun planned.

08:32.414 --> 08:35.717
Listen, while you wait on me, bogues
can make your favorite snacks...

08:35.719 --> 08:36.784
pancakes!

08:36.785 --> 08:39.120
Ah, we don't wanna impose.

08:39.121 --> 08:42.090
I mean, as much as I
do love pancakes...

08:42.092 --> 08:44.292
With melted butter and
sweet sweet syrup...

08:44.294 --> 08:45.360
okay, we'll impose.

08:48.697 --> 08:51.165
So, remind me again how you're
related to Dwyane Wade.

08:51.167 --> 08:54.302
My half-grandmother's second sister
married Dwyane's half-brother's

08:54.304 --> 08:57.138
Uncle's third cousin. It
can't be any simpler.

08:57.140 --> 09:00.141
<i>Guys...</i>

09:00.143 --> 09:02.043
Dwyane has creepy Austin
stuff everywhere.

09:02.045 --> 09:04.012
Check out this trophy I
found in the hallway.

09:04.014 --> 09:06.848
It's for being the
number-one Austin moon fan.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.150
Huh, I didn't know
they gave those out.

09:09.152 --> 09:11.452
They don't. He made it himself.

09:13.822 --> 09:15.356
There's nothing
creepy about that.

09:17.026 --> 09:18.026
Here you are...

09:18.028 --> 09:22.096
a stack of Austin moon pancakes.

09:22.098 --> 09:23.364
Whoa!

09:23.366 --> 09:24.899
Is that my face on those?

09:28.904 --> 09:30.838
Okay, that's a little creepy.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.174
Hey, look, I'm Austin.

09:45.754 --> 09:47.288
Here is your fork.

09:48.425 --> 09:51.059
I'll be right back with a knife.

09:52.027 --> 09:53.328
So you can cut the pancakes.

09:53.330 --> 09:56.097
Makes it easier to share.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.436
Come on, I'm gonna show you
how obsessed Dwyane is.

10:05.140 --> 10:08.843
Look, Dwyane changed all these book
titles, and put your name in them.

10:08.845 --> 10:09.978
Really?

10:09.980 --> 10:11.980
Yeah, see?

10:11.982 --> 10:14.816
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Austin."

10:14.818 --> 10:17.185
"Austin and Juliet."

10:17.187 --> 10:20.021
Oh, a "can you find
Austin?" Book!

10:20.023 --> 10:21.456
There he is.

10:21.458 --> 10:22.523
There he is.

10:23.792 --> 10:25.426
There...

10:25.428 --> 10:27.862
- There he is.
- This is weird.

10:27.864 --> 10:30.231
I mean, who would
take the time to...

10:33.103 --> 10:34.170
Whoa!

10:34.201 --> 10:38.439
He has a whole secret
shrine to you, Austin.

10:38.441 --> 10:41.209
Uh, look, there's
photos and bobbleheads,

10:41.211 --> 10:43.011
<i>even an Austin
moon cuckoo clock.</i>

10:43.013 --> 10:46.047
I knew it! I told
you he's obsessed.

10:46.049 --> 10:47.281
- Huh.
- Okay, I believe you now.

10:47.283 --> 10:48.282
Yeah.

10:48.284 --> 10:49.517
This whole thing is a little...

10:49.519 --> 10:51.586
<i>Cuckoo, cuckoo.</i>

10:53.989 --> 10:55.056
Yeah, what he said.

11:02.197 --> 11:03.865
We gotta get out of here.

11:03.867 --> 11:07.068
It's cool Dwyane's such a big fan,
but the longer we stay here...

11:07.070 --> 11:08.970
The crazier it gets.

11:10.039 --> 11:11.906
Dez, he's your cousin.

11:11.908 --> 11:13.508
Why don't you just tell him
we're tired of hanging out?

11:13.510 --> 11:16.010
'Cause then he'll get
upset and tell my mom.

11:16.012 --> 11:18.079
Dwyane is a huge tattletale.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.915
Let's just sneak out.

11:20.917 --> 11:22.150
Oh.

11:31.326 --> 11:33.027
I can't open the door.
It's jammed.

11:33.029 --> 11:34.309
Where do you think you're going?

11:37.567 --> 11:40.034
We're, uh, headed home.

11:40.036 --> 11:41.035
It's getting late.

11:41.037 --> 11:42.370
Oh, I don't think so.

11:42.372 --> 11:44.572
<i>Nobody leaves casa d. Wade...</i>

11:44.574 --> 11:46.007
Ever.

11:49.212 --> 11:50.978
Follow my lead.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.581
Hey, bogues.

11:53.583 --> 11:56.584
Why don't we play a quick
game of hide-and-seek,

11:56.586 --> 11:58.720
while we wait for
Dwyane to get back?

11:59.988 --> 12:03.191
You're "it." Close your
eyes and we'll all hide.

12:03.193 --> 12:05.259
Aw, why does he get to be "it"?

12:06.495 --> 12:08.162
What?

12:08.164 --> 12:10.565
Ohh...

12:10.567 --> 12:11.999
Wait, what?

12:14.970 --> 12:17.105
Bogues.

12:17.107 --> 12:20.174
Count to 50, and
we'll all go hide.

12:20.176 --> 12:22.343
Okay.

12:22.345 --> 12:30.345
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

12:32.522 --> 12:39.327
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen...

12:44.199 --> 12:48.136
Okay, you guys hide behind the counter,
and I'm gonna hide in the piano.

12:51.173 --> 12:54.142
Is anyone gonna tell him we're not
actually playing hide-and-seek?

12:54.144 --> 12:55.176
Not just yet.

13:02.184 --> 13:04.685
<i>Ow! Oh! Ow.</i>

13:04.687 --> 13:06.621
Okay, now we can tell him.

13:08.957 --> 13:12.126
We only said we were playing
hide-and-seek to get away from Dwyane.

13:12.128 --> 13:13.327
Oh.

13:13.329 --> 13:14.529
Well, that didn't work.

13:14.531 --> 13:15.530
Hey, cuz!

13:15.532 --> 13:17.198
Hey, guys.

13:18.535 --> 13:21.202
Hey, you left before I
could show you my song.

13:21.204 --> 13:23.237
- Your song?
- Yeah.

13:23.239 --> 13:26.040
I was hoping me and Austin could
perform it at his next gig.

13:26.042 --> 13:29.143
You see, I've always
wanted to be a rock star.

13:29.145 --> 13:31.112
<i>I wanna be Austin moon.</i>

13:31.114 --> 13:33.181
Bam!

13:33.183 --> 13:36.050
Look, it's cool you
wanna be me, Dwyane.

13:36.052 --> 13:39.353
I mean, I wanna be you, but I'm
not asking the heat to put me in

13:39.355 --> 13:41.522
the starting lineup
next weekend.

13:41.524 --> 13:43.324
Unless you could make that happen!
Can you?

13:43.326 --> 13:44.659
Mmm...

13:44.661 --> 13:47.094
Nope.

13:47.096 --> 13:50.698
Uh, look, Dwyane, we appreciate your
interest, but there's no way...

13:50.700 --> 13:54.168
we can give you an answer
until we discuss it first.

13:54.170 --> 13:55.610
Guys?

13:59.308 --> 14:01.142
Look, there's no way he
can perform with me.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.611
This concert's too big. I'm
streaming it live around the world.

14:03.613 --> 14:05.279
This is the only way
to get rid of him.

14:05.281 --> 14:09.584
Okay, first, not all of
us wanna get rid of him.

14:09.586 --> 14:11.252
And second, what are
you talking about?

14:11.254 --> 14:15.423
Dwyane gets obsessed with things,
but once he does them, he moves on.

14:15.425 --> 14:17.558
Ah, when we were kids, he
wanted to be a fireman,

14:17.560 --> 14:21.329
then he wanted to be an astronaut,
then a chef, then a ballerina.

14:21.331 --> 14:24.065
Man, he did not look
good in a tutu.

14:24.067 --> 14:29.470
So, if I sing his song and let him perform,
he'll stop being obsessed with me?

14:29.472 --> 14:30.538
Yep.

14:31.773 --> 14:34.075
Dwyane, you got yourself a deal.

14:34.077 --> 14:36.110
Yes!

14:36.112 --> 14:38.446
Wait, shouldn't you at
least hear the song

14:38.448 --> 14:41.449
before you commit to performing
it in front of the whole world?

14:41.451 --> 14:43.150
How bad could it be?

15:11.413 --> 15:15.082
Did he really just rhyme "girl"
with "girl" eight times?

15:15.084 --> 15:16.851
I think it was 12.

15:25.861 --> 15:27.662
Let's just tell
Dwyane the truth.

15:27.664 --> 15:30.631
His song is terrible and there's
no way Austin can sing it.

15:30.633 --> 15:32.233
Why beat around the bush?

15:32.235 --> 15:34.235
Perfect. So you're
gonna tell him?

15:34.237 --> 15:36.237
Ho-ho, no.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.472
I'll be hiding behind the bush.

15:38.474 --> 15:41.309
I don't know what you guys are
making such a big deal about.

15:41.311 --> 15:43.244
Just sing the song and
get it over with.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.146
Yeah, it's not like you're
streaming your show

15:45.148 --> 15:46.714
for all of your
international fans

15:46.716 --> 15:49.350
and embarrassing yourself in
front of the whole world.

15:49.352 --> 15:51.519
That's exactly what I'm doing.

15:52.688 --> 15:56.524
Well, if we can't tell him the
truth and we can't sing the song,

15:56.526 --> 15:58.826
then what other
choice do we have?

15:59.828 --> 16:01.896
I guess we can try
and fix the song.

16:01.898 --> 16:05.666
Why don't we invite Dwyane to an
emergency songwriting session?

16:05.668 --> 16:08.836
Great idea! You can teach him
how to be a better songwriter.

16:08.838 --> 16:10.805
What up?!

16:10.807 --> 16:12.773
I have a better idea.

16:12.775 --> 16:15.142
You know that new song
we just finished?

16:15.144 --> 16:17.878
We'll trick Dwyane into
thinking he wrote it.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.147
I still think we can
use Dwyane's song.

16:20.149 --> 16:24.318
If you just change the word "girl"
to "Trish"... It's not so bad.

16:42.471 --> 16:46.574
So, Dwyane, we love your song and
can't wait for Austin to perform it.

16:46.576 --> 16:49.410
We just have a few
minor suggestions.

16:49.412 --> 16:51.746
Less than minor. More
like mini suggestions.

16:51.748 --> 16:52.813
Eee.

16:52.815 --> 16:54.749
Cool. I'm down.

16:54.751 --> 16:57.536
All right, why don't you
play us what you have now?

16:57.567 --> 17:00.588
And we'll stop you if we have
any ideas for improvements.

17:01.657 --> 17:03.491
Okay, we're gonna stop you.

17:03.493 --> 17:05.259
So, it's a great start,

17:05.261 --> 17:08.295
but what if instead of playing
all the way down there,

17:08.297 --> 17:11.464
you played a little
more over here?

17:11.467 --> 17:14.535
<i>No.</i>

17:14.537 --> 17:16.704
<i>No. No.</i>

17:16.705 --> 17:18.472
Um, just right here.

17:19.474 --> 17:20.941
Perfect.

17:23.780 --> 17:26.280
Okay, gonna stop you again.

17:26.281 --> 17:27.647
What if instead of this...

17:28.918 --> 17:31.752
we try this.

17:41.897 --> 17:43.397
Whoa.

17:43.399 --> 17:44.832
That's awesome.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.001
Dwyane, you're a natural.

17:47.003 --> 17:49.370
Look at what you just did.

17:49.372 --> 17:53.307
I knew I had it in me.

17:53.309 --> 17:55.242
Do you think my lyrics
will work with this?

17:55.244 --> 17:57.278
Maybe they don't have to.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.813
Excuse me.

17:58.815 --> 18:02.817
So, when you wrote
"girl, you are my girl,"

18:02.819 --> 18:04.485
what were you trying to express?

18:04.487 --> 18:08.255
I think I was trying
to say to a girl...

18:08.257 --> 18:09.757
That's she's my girl.

18:12.027 --> 18:14.261
Interesting.

18:14.263 --> 18:17.031
See, when we first heard "girl,"

18:17.033 --> 18:19.033
we thought it was a
metaphor for a prize,

18:19.035 --> 18:21.302
as something you'd
do anything to win.

18:21.304 --> 18:23.037
Oh, yeah.

18:23.039 --> 18:24.038
That too.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.183
So, in that case, why
don't we try this?

18:39.489 --> 18:42.323
Man!

18:42.325 --> 18:45.659
I'm a better songwriter
than I thought.

18:45.661 --> 18:47.761
It's amazing what a few
minor changes can do.

18:56.404 --> 18:57.905
Ally, I can't watch
you pace anymore.

18:57.907 --> 18:59.373
My neck is cramping.

18:59.375 --> 19:00.808
I can't help it.

19:00.810 --> 19:03.744
Austin moon fans all over the world
are gonna be seeing this performance,

19:03.746 --> 19:05.479
and I don't know if
Dwyane can pull it off.

19:05.481 --> 19:07.815
You children have
nothing to worry about.

19:07.817 --> 19:09.984
I helped Dwyane with
his choreography.

19:15.490 --> 19:17.057
Great.

19:17.059 --> 19:18.993
Now I'm not worried at all.

19:28.470 --> 19:29.703
Hey, everybody.

19:29.705 --> 19:32.840
I'd like to give a shout-out to
my fans all around the world.

19:34.810 --> 19:39.613
As a special treat, this first song
is written by n.B.A. Superstar,

19:39.615 --> 19:40.915
Dwyane Wade.

21:00.061 --> 21:02.896
That was awesome. You
killed it out there.

21:02.898 --> 21:04.164
Austin, you were okay too.

21:05.935 --> 21:07.468
Yeah, you were great, Dwyane.

21:07.470 --> 21:08.602
Thanks.

21:08.604 --> 21:09.803
But you still owe me.

21:10.772 --> 21:12.139
I know I didn't write that song.

21:12.141 --> 21:13.207
You and Ally tricked me.

21:14.776 --> 21:17.811
Oh, no, you're never gonna
leave us alone now, are you?

21:17.813 --> 21:19.113
It's all good.

21:19.115 --> 21:21.448
Because of you, I got
to be a rock star.

21:21.450 --> 21:22.549
Thanks, man.

21:22.551 --> 21:23.817
You're welcome.

21:23.819 --> 21:26.453
What up?!

21:26.455 --> 21:29.056
You know the Austin
and Dez handshake?

21:29.058 --> 21:31.625
It's mine. Dez stole it from me.

21:31.627 --> 21:33.694
It's true.

21:35.450 --> 21:36.730
What up?!

21:36.732 --> 21:38.065
See you at Thanksgiving, cuz?

21:38.067 --> 21:39.500
Don't be late.

21:39.502 --> 21:41.702
He makes a mean
broccoli casserole.

21:53.615 --> 21:54.915
Where'd you get all that stuff?

21:54.917 --> 21:56.117
Isn't that from Dwyane's house?

21:56.118 --> 21:57.985
Yeah, I found it in his trash.

21:57.987 --> 22:00.087
Apparently, he's over you.

22:01.623 --> 22:03.791
I told you letting him
perform would work.

22:03.793 --> 22:06.126
He threw out everything?

22:06.128 --> 22:08.028
Even the cuckoo clock?

22:09.510 --> 22:10.631
<i>Cuckoo...</i>

22:10.633 --> 22:12.700
<i>Cuckoo, cuckoo...</i>

22:15.236 --> 22:17.705
I guess I'm back to being
your number-one fan.

22:17.707 --> 22:21.108
This will fit perfectly in my
secret Austin Moon shrine.

22:22.010 --> 22:24.078
That I don't have.

22:28.717 --> 22:31.819
Oh, hey, Trish, Jace
got you a present.

22:31.821 --> 22:33.854
A chair?

22:33.856 --> 22:36.190
So romantic.

22:39.728 --> 22:41.562
Hey, Jace. Got your gift.

22:41.564 --> 22:44.565
Nothing says "sorry for blowing
you off" like a chair.

22:44.567 --> 22:46.066
Trish, let me explain.

22:46.068 --> 22:48.035
You think I want
some stupid chair?

22:48.037 --> 22:49.136
This is the most...

22:50.840 --> 22:54.041
amazing gift I've ever gotten!

22:54.043 --> 22:55.209
Whoa!

22:55.211 --> 22:59.380
So it's a massage chair
with a TV, and a cooler?!

22:59.382 --> 23:01.615
Whoa.

23:01.617 --> 23:03.984
Yeah, I wasn't blowing you off;

23:03.986 --> 23:06.820
I was working extra hours,
so I could buy it for you.

23:06.822 --> 23:08.288
It'll make up for not
always being there

23:08.290 --> 23:10.758
for shoulder rubs,
movies and milkshakes.

23:10.760 --> 23:11.959
Aww.

23:11.961 --> 23:13.961
Thank you, Jace.

23:13.963 --> 23:16.096
This is so sweet.

23:16.098 --> 23:17.965
I'm sorry for ever doubting you.

23:17.967 --> 23:20.267
Well, that's okay. Even
though we're apart,

23:20.269 --> 23:22.803
we can always share these
special moments together.

23:22.805 --> 23:24.517
I know in my heart
that what we have...

23:24.548 --> 23:26.303
Shh! I'm trying to
watch a movie here.
