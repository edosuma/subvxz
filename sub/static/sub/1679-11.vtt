00:00.735 --> 00:04.529
Kids, as you know, Christmas is a
time you spend with your family.

00:04.539 --> 00:07.355
So in December of 2006,
I had three options.

00:07.365 --> 00:10.186
Spend it with my mom and
her new boyfriend Clint,

00:10.196 --> 00:13.755
spend it with my dad and his
new girlfriend micro-brewing,

00:13.895 --> 00:15.964
or head down to Staten
Island to spend it

00:15.974 --> 00:19.164
with my super religious
cousin Stacy and her family.

00:19.274 --> 00:21.302
So I opted for
none of the above

00:21.312 --> 00:25.223
and decided to spend
Christmas 2006 in Manhattan...

00:26.544 --> 00:28.442
celebrating with
my other family.

00:30.936 --> 00:34.120
Okay, I have one last paper
due at 5:00 p.m. today,

00:34.133 --> 00:36.581
so until then,
I will be at the law library at school,

00:36.597 --> 00:38.273
but I'm not to be
disturbed for any reason.

00:38.309 --> 00:40.262
Dude, open your eyes.
You're going to hurt yourself.

00:40.299 --> 00:43.353
No, no. Christmas Eve winter
wonderland is my reward

00:43.367 --> 00:44.963
for finishing my paper.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.411
Baby, do I smell your
Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?

00:48.425 --> 00:49.543
Yes.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.003
Damn me and my
heightened other senses.

00:52.016 --> 00:53.371
Must be strong.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.713
Okay, I'll be back
here at 5:00.

00:55.728 --> 00:58.900
Save me at least 20 cookies
and do not clean the bowl.

01:01.807 --> 01:03.093
Was that a reindeer?

01:03.108 --> 01:04.340
I don't want to know!

01:09.075 --> 01:11.811
Hey, look.
Our old answering machine.

01:11.827 --> 01:14.351
Oh, yeah. After you left, 
we, uh, we unplugged it

01:14.366 --> 01:17.663
because it reminded Marshall of how
you used to, you know, leave messages.

01:17.677 --> 01:20.103
But hey,
you guys are back together.

01:20.117 --> 01:22.751
I say we're plugging
it back in.

01:24.535 --> 01:25.923
It's good to have you back.

01:26.065 --> 01:27.141
Thanks.

01:27.395 --> 01:30.123
Oh, hey, look,
there's still some messages on here.

01:30.188 --> 01:32.741
Hey Ted,
it's Dad calling to check in.

01:32.757 --> 01:35.112
I'm going fishing this
weekend with my friend Clint,

01:35.126 --> 01:38.690
so if I don't hear from you beforehand,
I'll talk to you next week.

01:38.706 --> 01:40.452
Yes, same Clint.

01:41.156 --> 01:44.650
Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the
couch right now moping about Lily?

01:44.778 --> 01:46.160
You are, aren't you?

01:46.175 --> 01:48.470
Well, stop it.
She's not worth it.

01:48.486 --> 01:50.440
You gotta get over that Grinch.

01:50.997 --> 01:52.950
But I didn't say "Grinch."

01:52.968 --> 01:54.772
I said a bad word.

01:54.786 --> 01:57.262
A very, very bad word.

01:58.427 --> 02:00.801
Oh, fudge.

02:00.818 --> 02:02.770
But I didn't say fudge.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.035 --> 02:23.250
I'm... a what?

02:23.315 --> 02:25.903
I-- That was Barney,
that was Barney.

02:25.916 --> 02:27.700
- That was you, Ted.
- That was Marshall.

02:27.718 --> 02:29.831
Marshall left a
message for Marshall?

02:29.847 --> 02:34.642
You know, it may have been me,
but it was so long ago.

02:35.377 --> 02:38.081
Man, that machine,
it really garbles your voice.

02:38.095 --> 02:39.413
You know, it almost 
made it sound like I said...

02:39.446 --> 02:41.330
Why would you call me that?

02:41.346 --> 02:43.043
It was a fair question.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.870
Marshall's breakup with Lily had
sent him into a deep depression

02:45.887 --> 02:47.502
and nothing could
get him out of it.

02:47.758 --> 02:49.370
Until one day...

02:49.596 --> 02:51.231
She was perfect.

02:51.966 --> 02:54.152
I lost the perfect woman.

02:54.798 --> 02:57.352
I should have knocked her
up when I had the chance.

02:57.367 --> 02:59.131
Okay. That's it.

02:59.626 --> 03:02.723
You're never going to get over her until
you stop putting her on a pedestal.

03:02.737 --> 03:06.693
So no more ice cream until you tell
me one thing that's wrong with Lily.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.761
There's only one of her?

03:10.028 --> 03:11.060
Okay.

03:11.075 --> 03:12.451
She called off your wedding

03:12.466 --> 03:15.072
and dumped you to be a
painter in San Francisco.

03:15.088 --> 03:16.480
What do you call that?

03:16.595 --> 03:18.741
Fiercely independent?

03:19.568 --> 03:20.892
Brave?

03:23.305 --> 03:25.373
I guess it was a
little selfish.

03:25.388 --> 03:27.062
There you go.

03:27.615 --> 03:31.781
And in almost no time,
that spark turned into a roaring fire.

03:31.796 --> 03:34.320
Yeah. No, you're right.
Lily would laugh at anything.

03:34.336 --> 03:36.023
She'd give it up for a bad pun.

03:36.036 --> 03:38.050
I'm telling you,
she's a laugh slut.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.922
Remember that time we
heard her laughing

03:39.936 --> 03:41.653
and we thought she was
watching Weekend At Bernie's,

03:41.688 --> 03:44.710
but it turned out she was
watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?

03:44.957 --> 03:46.411
And  her art?

03:46.426 --> 03:48.412
"I'm Lily, I'm an artist."

03:48.425 --> 03:50.132
She doesn't even own a beret.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.670
Yeah, and if she's
such a great "artist,"

03:52.687 --> 03:54.710
why does she suck
at Pictionary?

03:54.727 --> 03:57.840
Who draws a ninja star like a
Star of David? Right, right?

03:57.855 --> 03:58.901
Yeah!

03:58.915 --> 04:01.090
- Another round!
- Yeah!

04:01.155 --> 04:03.663
I was trying to help him.
I'm his best friend.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.523
That's the best friend's job.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.911
The best friend's job is
to call me that word?

04:09.355 --> 04:10.471
Yeah.

04:11.207 --> 04:12.722
Oh, Ted.

04:12.735 --> 04:14.383
Oh, Teddy boy.

04:14.405 --> 04:17.180
Why is this such a big deal?
It's just a word.

04:17.197 --> 04:19.212
We use lots of words,
every day.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.322
It shouldn't be any different
than any other word.

04:21.338 --> 04:23.112
Then why don't you say it now?

04:23.287 --> 04:24.703
Grinch.

04:26.986 --> 04:28.493
You timed that didn't you?

04:28.507 --> 04:29.860
Perfectly.

04:30.027 --> 04:31.951
Well, at least you apologized.

04:32.915 --> 04:34.552
You apologized, didn't you?

04:34.567 --> 04:35.663
Oh, yeah.

04:35.677 --> 04:38.191
"I'm sorry" were the first
words out of my mouth.

04:38.206 --> 04:40.831
I'm sorry,
but I am not apologizing.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.940
I was just trying to put
the guy back together.

04:42.957 --> 04:44.210
You smashed him to pieces.

04:44.227 --> 04:47.102
Are you seriously not going to
apologize for leaving that message?

04:47.117 --> 04:48.123
- No!
- Why not?

04:48.138 --> 04:50.610
Because, Lily, this summer,
you were kind of a Grinch.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.141
- Oooh.
- Oooh.

04:52.705 --> 04:56.010
Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.

04:56.977 --> 04:59.062
Ted Vivian Mosby!

04:59.076 --> 05:00.342
That's not my middle name.

00:00.006 --> 00:00.003
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,015
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

05:02.027 --> 05:04.073
Like you've never
said that word.

05:04.157 --> 05:06.183
I don't kiss your
mother with my mouth.

05:06.196 --> 05:07.351
Yet.

05:09.026 --> 05:10.130
Are you sick?

05:10.145 --> 05:13.203
Is it sick to find maturity
and experience sexy?

05:13.216 --> 05:14.900
No, I meant do you have a cold?

05:14.916 --> 05:16.210
I'm fine. 

05:20.758 --> 05:24.250
I'm fine. My nose 
is just overflowing with awesome

05:24.268 --> 05:25.901
and I had to get
some of it out.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.101
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the holidays are a time

05:29.116 --> 05:31.300
when people are
lonely and desperate.

05:31.316 --> 05:34.161
It's the most wonderful
time of the year.

05:36.098 --> 05:38.971
I  should go apologize.
It's Christmas Eve.

05:38.985 --> 05:43.223
Yeah. I mean,
slamming doors and screaming curses?

05:43.235 --> 05:45.790
If I wanted that, I would 
have gone home for the holidays.

05:48.866 --> 05:51.560
I don't see any
mistletoe, but...

05:52.557 --> 05:55.631
Oh!  Oh, God!

05:56.626 --> 05:59.431
Uh... "Bless you"
would have been nice.

06:00.997 --> 06:02.431
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

06:02.508 --> 06:04.041
- You're sick.
- You know what? I am sick.

06:04.075 --> 06:06.903
Sick of you telling me I'm sick.
What up?

06:13.755 --> 06:17.531
Ahh... Three flights of stairs,
not a drop spilled.

06:17.547 --> 06:18.783
Hey, buddy.

06:20.055 --> 06:21.541
You sure this is gonna work?

06:21.556 --> 06:22.660
Yeah, this is our thing.

06:22.676 --> 06:25.090
In college, whenever I wanted to make
up with her, I'd buy her a beer.

06:25.126 --> 06:26.780
- Cute, right?
- Totally.

06:26.797 --> 06:28.001
Plus free mug.

06:29.086 --> 06:30.840
Okay, come on.

06:31.123 --> 06:33.311
Usually that would've
done the trick,

06:33.327 --> 06:37.163
but it turned out this was a problem
not even alcohol could solve.

06:44.339 --> 06:46.692
Actually the beer
helped a little.

06:51.509 --> 06:53.043
She took the decorations.

06:53.335 --> 06:55.643
She took the decorations!

06:55.657 --> 06:56.920
What a Grinch!

06:56.937 --> 06:58.942
That time I did say "Grinch."

06:58.957 --> 06:59.962
All right.

06:59.977 --> 07:01.782
I guess I have to
call her, right?

07:03.385 --> 07:04.982
Lily's cell phone.

07:04.998 --> 07:07.150
She'll listen to
reason-- right?

07:08.508 --> 07:10.080
Oh, hey, Billy.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.143
Actually, funny thing--
the voice dial got you.

07:13.155 --> 07:14.413
I was trying to call...

07:14.997 --> 07:17.480
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:18.107 --> 07:21.393
Yeah, the holidays are a rough
time for everyone, Billy.

07:22.327 --> 07:24.871
Okay, yeah,
dinner next Wednesday.

07:24.906 --> 07:26.323
Okay.

07:26.867 --> 07:28.581
Damn voice dial.

07:31.537 --> 07:34.533
Barney! What the
hell are you doing?

07:34.548 --> 07:37.680
Get in here, it's freezing outside.
Are you insane?

07:37.696 --> 07:42.412
Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive
"no cigars in the apartment rule."

07:42.427 --> 07:44.823
God, it's like Marshall's
marrying the Taliban.

07:45.656 --> 07:46.632
High five.

07:46.648 --> 07:48.100
Eww. No.

07:48.115 --> 07:50.683
You have to go home
and get to bed.

07:51.356 --> 07:55.393
Oh, Robin, my simple friend 
from the untamed north,

07:56.055 --> 08:00.812
let me tell you about a little
thing I like to call mind over body.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.882
You see,
whenever I start feeling sick,

08:03.897 --> 08:07.383
I just stop being sick
and be awesome instead.

08:07.395 --> 08:08.931
True story.

08:09.045 --> 08:11.850
Yeah, in two minutes,

08:11.867 --> 08:16.303
I'm going to pound a sixer 
of Red Bull, hop in a cab,

08:16.318 --> 08:18.620
play a couple of
hours of laser tag,

08:18.636 --> 08:21.981
maybe get a spray-on tan.

08:22.548 --> 08:25.082
It's gonna be legen...

08:25.158 --> 08:26.932
Wait for it...

08:30.706 --> 08:31.533
Lily!

08:31.548 --> 08:33.461
Merry Christmas, assface.

08:33.926 --> 08:36.840
Um, Lily?
Where are the Christmas decorations?

08:36.856 --> 08:38.602
At my apartment.

08:39.217 --> 08:42.432
You want to bring them back so we can
celebrate Christmas together-- please?

08:42.447 --> 08:44.351
Ted, do you know
what I would do

08:44.367 --> 08:46.970
if one of my kindergartners
used that kind of language?

08:46.988 --> 08:49.230
I would be on the phone
with their parents.

08:49.245 --> 08:51.183
Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.

08:51.196 --> 08:53.300
Exactly. You know
what that word means.

08:53.316 --> 08:56.443
You know that calling people
names is mean and hurtful...

08:56.457 --> 08:57.851
assface.

08:58.136 --> 09:01.442
Lily, if you don't bring that
stuff back right now, we...

09:02.275 --> 09:03.401
She hung up.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.391
She's just mad.
She'll cool down.

09:07.818 --> 09:08.690
Lily...

09:08.708 --> 09:10.792
Don't forget to take the
cookies out of the oven...

09:10.806 --> 09:11.963
assface!

09:12.756 --> 09:13.970
Damn it!

09:14.227 --> 09:17.631
I could be in Cleveland right now
making peppermint lager with my dad.

09:17.648 --> 09:19.112
Where are you going?

09:19.155 --> 09:20.693
Marshall gets home
in three hours.

09:20.708 --> 09:24.013
He's gonna show up--
no Lily, no winter wonderland.

09:24.026 --> 09:25.932
I gotta get up to the Bronx.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.062
...dary.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.862
Hey, dude,
how's the paper going?

09:34.876 --> 09:37.641
Screw the paper, how's the winter
wonderland? Is it magical?

09:37.656 --> 09:39.382
Oh...  so magical.

09:39.396 --> 09:40.812
When you walk through the door,
does it feel like

09:40.848 --> 09:43.532
you've been slapped in
the face by Christmas?

09:43.548 --> 09:45.392
Sure does. Look, I gotta go.

09:45.406 --> 09:47.802
Come on, man, describe it!
Tell me about the decorations.

09:47.818 --> 09:49.791
Is Rudolph there?
He is, isn't he?

09:49.807 --> 09:51.541
Hi, Rudolph!

09:51.555 --> 09:54.001
Ah, yeah, but, you know...

09:54.016 --> 09:56.422
decorations, is that really
what Christmas is about?

09:56.437 --> 09:58.103
Hell, yeah!
What else would it be about?

09:58.116 --> 10:00.622
Uh, try the birth of Christ.

10:00.905 --> 10:04.101
You know, Christmas--
Christ Mas,

10:04.118 --> 10:07.243
which means "More Christ"
to our Spanish friends.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.882
Yeah, well,
all I know is walking in that door

10:09.898 --> 10:13.990
and seeing the winter wonderland
and seeing Lily and all you guys,

10:14.007 --> 10:15.971
just... I can't wait.

10:15.986 --> 10:17.890
Right. I gotta go.

10:17.906 --> 10:18.962
Right. Okay.

10:18.978 --> 10:20.611
Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.
One more thing.

10:20.647 --> 10:22.893
How about the cookies?
Are they delicious?

10:27.206 --> 10:29.582
You know, honestly,
they taste a little store-bought.

10:29.937 --> 10:31.841
Oh! I got another call.

10:31.857 --> 10:33.582
Well, tell Lily I love her.

10:33.597 --> 10:34.553
Right.

10:34.998 --> 10:37.971
- Hello?
- Ted Evelyn Mosby!

10:37.987 --> 10:40.323
Oh. Uh, hey, Mom.
Merry Christmas.

10:40.337 --> 10:43.662
I just got the most
disturbing call from Lily.

10:43.678 --> 10:46.940
How could you use
such a horrible word?

10:46.955 --> 10:48.583
Oh, God, she called you?

10:48.598 --> 10:50.643
Are you acting out
because of the divorce?

10:50.657 --> 10:52.493
Is-is this all about Clint?

10:52.507 --> 10:54.531
No, Mom,
why would it be about Clint?

10:54.548 --> 10:58.030
Hey, buddy, it's Clint.
How you doing, champ?

10:58.105 --> 11:01.523
Hey, Clint. Listen, um,
I don't really have time to...

11:01.536 --> 11:03.013
Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted.

11:03.026 --> 11:04.202
You don't know this yet,

11:04.216 --> 11:06.903
but you and I are going
to be great friends.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.740
Now, the Native Americans
have this ritual...

11:17.608 --> 11:20.921
This is a low moment
for the Barnacle.

11:21.248 --> 11:24.663
I should be off playing
laser tag right now,

11:24.677 --> 11:26.193
but instead...

11:26.978 --> 11:29.292
Don't look at me. I'm hideous.

11:29.488 --> 11:31.592
You just look like
a regular guy.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.712
Exactly.

11:32.725 --> 11:36.710
I'm a Ted.
I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.

11:36.728 --> 11:38.770
And isn't it more comfy?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.133
Yes.

11:40.877 --> 11:42.993
Come on,
you need eat something.

11:43.695 --> 11:47.970
Too weak... to hold... bowl.

11:48.767 --> 11:51.202
Fine, I'll feed you.

11:55.958 --> 11:58.772
Ouchie in my mouth!

12:02.908 --> 12:05.350
I don't want it.
I want ice cream.

12:05.365 --> 12:08.220
No, you're not having ice cream
for dinner just 'cause you're sick.

12:08.237 --> 12:09.933
- But my throat hurts.
- No.

12:09.947 --> 12:11.423
I hate you!

12:11.458 --> 12:12.862
Don't leave me.

12:20.547 --> 12:22.070
Who is it? 

12:22.087 --> 12:23.592
Pizza delivery.

12:27.548 --> 12:28.851
Whoa.

12:28.866 --> 12:30.770
Hey, you tricked me.

12:30.788 --> 12:32.833
You really thought I was
the pizza delivery guy?

12:33.026 --> 12:35.080
No, I knew it was you.

12:35.097 --> 12:37.521
I just thought you'd at
least bring a pizza.

12:37.538 --> 12:38.931
Yeah, well,

12:39.747 --> 12:42.443
I brought a beer,
but I gave it to a homeless guy.

12:43.186 --> 12:45.333
All  right, he took it from me.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.413
Now, will you please come home?

12:47.426 --> 12:50.400
No, I'm not spending
Christmas with you.

12:50.416 --> 12:53.172
Okay, I'm sorry for
calling you a...

12:53.406 --> 12:55.070
that word,

12:55.086 --> 12:56.622
over the summer,

12:56.638 --> 12:58.602
and for saying it again today.

12:58.837 --> 13:01.481
And for thinking it a lot
on the subway ride over.

13:01.497 --> 13:05.562
I had no right to say that. It was
hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.

13:05.578 --> 13:07.150
Oh, shut up.

13:07.168 --> 13:11.263
You think I don't know your fake
apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh?

13:11.278 --> 13:13.672
You're clearly still mad at me.

13:13.686 --> 13:15.532
- I'm not mad at you.
- Yes, you are.

13:15.547 --> 13:17.662
I am not mad at you, Lily.
Now, can we please just...

13:17.676 --> 13:20.083
I've apologized to Marshall
and he's forgiven me

13:20.096 --> 13:22.130
and we've moved passed it.
Why can't you?

13:22.148 --> 13:24.971
Because you never
apologized to me.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.451
Marshall's not the only
one you walked out on.

13:27.485 --> 13:29.983
You leave for three months,
you don't even call.

13:29.996 --> 13:32.160
Come on, Lily,
we're supposed to be friends!

13:32.178 --> 13:34.120
Yeah, some friend,
you called me a Grinch.

13:34.137 --> 13:36.420
- You were a Grinch!
- How can you...

13:36.438 --> 13:41.110
Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch,
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.

13:42.498 --> 13:43.630
Happy?

13:43.647 --> 13:46.020
Now, you've pissed off
the big guy upstairs.

13:46.037 --> 13:48.220
Yeah, I'm sure
God cares if I...

13:48.236 --> 13:51.432
You use that language again
and I'll turn off your water!

13:51.448 --> 13:53.870
That's my super.
He lives above me.

13:53.888 --> 13:55.843
Great. Thanks to
your filthy mouth,

13:55.857 --> 13:58.391
now I'm going to have
Christmas alone in the dark.

13:58.408 --> 14:01.142
Fine. I don't want
to ruin Christmas.

14:01.158 --> 14:03.122
You can have the apartment.
Don't worry about seeing me there

14:03.156 --> 14:05.100
I'll be in Staten Island
with my cousin Stacy.

14:05.117 --> 14:06.153
Just....

14:09.817 --> 14:11.072
Ow.

14:14.058 --> 14:15.732
Merry Christmas.

14:16.697 --> 14:19.053
You're spending Christmas
Eve with your family?

14:19.068 --> 14:21.671
Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.

14:21.688 --> 14:24.410
Uh, they're fine. They're just...
they're a little weird.

14:24.426 --> 14:26.850
You know they don't believe
in gifts or Christmas trees.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.161
And they think Santa's
how Satan spells his name

14:29.176 --> 14:31.062
when he wants to trick us.

14:31.456 --> 14:33.110
Well, do you want
me to go with you?

14:33.128 --> 14:34.423
Was that a sincere offer?

14:34.437 --> 14:36.243
First tell me your answer.

14:36.258 --> 14:37.970
Stay there. Save yourself.

14:37.988 --> 14:39.421
We'll spend all day
together tomorrow.

14:39.455 --> 14:40.272
Okay.

14:40.287 --> 14:41.511
Oh, how's Barney feeling?

14:41.528 --> 14:44.361
You mean the whiney
bottomless pit of neediness?

14:44.376 --> 14:48.211
He was bugging me, so I spiked
his echinacea tea with codeine.

14:49.968 --> 14:52.162
You're gonna be a great mom.

14:56.265 --> 15:01.203
Holy crap, the magical 
Christmas season is upon us.

15:01.216 --> 15:04.350
And thank God we don't
pay for utilities.

15:04.368 --> 15:05.823
Merry Christmas!

15:05.835 --> 15:07.451
What's in the box?

15:08.656 --> 15:11.752
Only the best present
for the best girl ever.

15:11.766 --> 15:13.322
It took me all day
to track it down.

15:13.336 --> 15:15.012
I thought you were
writing a paper.

15:15.027 --> 15:17.013
Ah, naw, I blew that off.
I'll get an extension.

15:17.026 --> 15:18.200
School's not important.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.840
What is that pitter
patter on the roof?

15:21.856 --> 15:25.552
Could it be the sound of
an awesome Christmas story

15:25.565 --> 15:27.703
about to come down the chimney?

15:28.088 --> 15:30.120
Why, yes, it is.

15:30.168 --> 15:32.492
'Twas the day
before Christmas...

15:32.505 --> 15:34.562
It was supposed to arrive,
like, five days ago,

15:34.575 --> 15:36.411
but then it got
lost and rerouted.

15:36.428 --> 15:38.840
I checked two other branches,
finally they told me it was here.

15:38.878 --> 15:41.650
Yeah, all I needed to know
was the tracking number.

15:42.797 --> 15:46.213
Looks like it's headed out to our
regional branch in Poughkeepsie.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.260
What?

15:47.277 --> 15:49.841
No, no, no, no,
I need that package today.

15:49.855 --> 15:52.201
Listen, the truck already
left five minutes ago,

15:52.217 --> 15:54.823
so unless you want
to run after it...

15:55.268 --> 15:58.343
Stop! Stop!

15:58.866 --> 16:00.783
Stop, please, stop.

16:00.795 --> 16:03.231
Stop. Stop the truck.

16:06.616 --> 16:10.273
I need a package on your truck.
Can I please take a look in back?

16:10.287 --> 16:12.583
Sure. But I gotta keep
driving my route.

16:12.595 --> 16:14.053
I'm running behind.

16:19.736 --> 16:21.382
My bad.

16:21.405 --> 16:22.761
I'm okay.

16:25.607 --> 16:29.043
Hey, man, thanks for helping me
make my fiancée's Christmas.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.220
No problem.

16:30.235 --> 16:33.533
Too bad I can't deliver all these
packages by the end of the day.

16:33.545 --> 16:37.821
Wait, so some people aren't going to
get their gifts in time for Christmas?

16:37.837 --> 16:40.330
Sadly, no.

16:51.465 --> 16:54.083
# They call me back door Santa #

16:54.628 --> 16:58.322
# I make my runs #
# about the break of day #

17:00.655 --> 17:03.621
# They call me back door Santa #

17:03.935 --> 17:07.931
# I make my runs #
# about the break of day #

17:07.945 --> 17:09.531
# Oh, ho, ho #

17:09.895 --> 17:12.900
# I make all #
# the little girls happy... #

17:12.915 --> 17:15.923
We delivered every single
package on that truck.

17:15.936 --> 17:18.471
But I still have one
package left to give.

17:18.718 --> 17:20.143
Yeah, I did.

17:21.377 --> 17:22.931
Merry Christmas.

17:23.508 --> 17:25.233
- Open it, Baby.
- Okay.

17:26.996 --> 17:28.783
Oh, my God.

17:28.828 --> 17:31.331
An Easy Bake Oven!

17:31.427 --> 17:34.333
I've wanted one of these ever
since I was a little girl.

17:34.348 --> 17:36.542
In this exact model.

17:36.998 --> 17:40.020
I never told you that.
How did you know?

17:40.608 --> 17:42.890
It's our first Christmas
since we got back together.

17:42.905 --> 17:44.571
I want to get her
something really special.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.363
So I'm getting her a jukebox.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.460
Wow, that's a great gift.

17:48.477 --> 17:51.201
Not really.
It's this big and it dispenses gum.

17:52.695 --> 17:55.513
Oh, man, I know 
something you could get her

17:55.525 --> 17:58.033
that would blow her mind.

17:58.835 --> 18:00.130
Ready? 

18:00.148 --> 18:01.853
Eight years ago...

18:02.998 --> 18:08.021
When I was a kid,
all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven.

18:08.038 --> 18:09.641
I begged and I begged,

18:09.657 --> 18:13.601
but all I got was a stupid Lego set
because my feminist mom

18:13.615 --> 18:17.632
didn't want me conforming to
traditional gender roles.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.641
Easy Bake Oven--
that's what I'm going to call my van.

18:25.826 --> 18:28.880
Dude... how was the concert?

18:29.856 --> 18:32.740
I  couldn't find the outside.

18:37.525 --> 18:40.683
I can't believe Ted remembered
after all these years.

18:40.698 --> 18:43.052
Yeah, and after all that weed.

18:44.006 --> 18:45.443
Where is he anyway?

18:45.897 --> 18:47.683
Staten Island.

18:48.207 --> 18:49.651
Why?

18:53.247 --> 18:57.163
Okay, don't tell your mom,
but I got you guys some presents.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.480
Like the gift
of God's love?

18:59.498 --> 19:01.490
No, dude, real presents.

19:02.267 --> 19:05.212
Uncle Ted got us presents!

19:05.627 --> 19:09.171
That's okay, Ted,
we'll just give them to charity.

19:09.187 --> 19:10.190
Yay!

19:10.206 --> 19:12.001
Uh, not you, Charity.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.291
I meant the less fortunate.

19:14.738 --> 19:18.190
Ted, how would you like
to say grace tonight?

19:18.207 --> 19:20.321
Uh, you know what,
why don't you say it.

19:20.336 --> 19:21.932
I really wouldn't
know what to say.

19:21.948 --> 19:25.112
Why don't you recite your
favorite passage of scripture.

19:25.167 --> 19:27.581
That's a great idea, Charity.

19:27.595 --> 19:28.892
But, really, I don't know.

19:28.908 --> 19:31.162
I mean how do you choose
your favorite passage?

19:31.176 --> 19:35.320
It's the Bible; there's so many...
great ones...

19:35.336 --> 19:37.742
That one from Pulp
Fiction's pretty cool.

19:37.756 --> 19:40.332
Ooh, I'll get it.
Charity, I'm tapping you in.

19:40.348 --> 19:42.982
Dear, Father,
thank you for this day,

19:42.997 --> 19:45.692
and thank you for bringing
this family together.

19:45.705 --> 19:47.030
Amen.

19:47.066 --> 19:48.592
Who is it, Ted?

19:49.085 --> 19:52.863
Uh, it's...
it's just, um, carolers.

19:55.926 --> 20:00.123
# Silent night #

20:00.135 --> 20:04.211
# Holy night... #

20:05.267 --> 20:07.971
I came here to apologize.

20:08.027 --> 20:09.150
I'm so sorry, Ted.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.030
I accept. Give me the beer.

20:13.508 --> 20:17.622
Oh, oh,
it is so good to see you guys.

20:17.636 --> 20:19.290
Are you coming home?

20:20.458 --> 20:21.990
Totally.

20:22.015 --> 20:23.901
But first, Lily,
I owe you an apology.

20:23.915 --> 20:26.963
Oh, for the love of God,
are you as sick of apologies as I am?

20:26.976 --> 20:27.753
Yes!

20:27.767 --> 20:30.640
Can we just skip the apology and
go straight to the forgiving?

20:30.658 --> 20:31.833
Yes.

20:31.916 --> 20:36.082
And I promise, I will never ever
call you a... you know, again.

20:36.097 --> 20:37.223
That's okay.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.050
I was kind of a Grinch.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.032
What's a Grinch?

20:41.727 --> 20:45.332
Nothing. It's something
you shouldn't say.

20:45.376 --> 20:47.921
Mom, what's a Grinch?

20:48.255 --> 20:50.691
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...

20:54.645 --> 20:56.331
Merry Christmas, everybody.

20:57.646 --> 20:59.252
Run, run.

21:17.765 --> 21:19.740
Merry Christmas, Marshall.
