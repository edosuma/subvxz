01:04.929 --> 01:07.921
Good night, sir.

01:33.889 --> 01:36.881
Hey, miss.
- Oh, thank god.

01:37.849 --> 01:41.808
Someone's here. Please, I need
your help. My car always breaks down.

01:41.849 --> 01:45.683
I just need to use the phone.
- This area's... restricted.

01:45.729 --> 01:49.085
But there's nowhere else for miles.
- Miss, no.

01:50.409 --> 01:55.039
Oh, let me help you.

05:08.969 --> 05:13.759
Lars, I'm on vacation.
- Sit down. Have a pastry.

05:16.929 --> 05:21.320
Look... we have a situation.
- What about Malcolm, he's in Berlin.

05:21.369 --> 05:25.328
No. He's back in the states.
Anyway, you're it. Relax.

05:25.369 --> 05:29.920
It's fast and easy.
It's a babysitting job.

05:29.969 --> 05:32.927
May I get you something?
- No, thank you.

05:32.969 --> 05:36.598
I'll have another one of these.
You sure you don't want a pastry?

05:36.649 --> 05:39.209
Tell me.
- Galina Konstantin.

05:41.249 --> 05:45.162
She's a high-tech thief who's been
slipping us information for years.

05:45.209 --> 05:49.168
Now she's acquired some critical
information from a reactionary party

05:49.209 --> 05:52.645
in Slovakia.
I need you to handle the extraction.

05:52.689 --> 05:54.680
Specs.

05:58.609 --> 06:02.284
Her cover.
She's some kind of circus freak.

06:02.809 --> 06:06.768
You leave for Slovakia tonight.
You meet her near the border

06:06.809 --> 06:10.768
and take her to Munich. You'll be out
of the country before the government

06:10.809 --> 06:14.324
knows what's up.
- We're going by train?

06:14.369 --> 06:18.328
The airport's too hot and all the other
outs are blown. Here's her down payment.

06:18.369 --> 06:21.998
50.000, American, unmarked.
She gets the rest

06:22.049 --> 06:25.485
when she delivers the goods.
- Any ideas

06:25.529 --> 06:28.566
how to explain this to my wife?
- No.

06:30.729 --> 06:34.688
Your son needs a father who's around.
You can't go running off.

06:34.729 --> 06:38.404
I'm not running off.
- I get time off from the hospital, too.

06:38.449 --> 06:42.488
But you're away for two days and...
- You think I like that interrupting?

06:42.529 --> 06:45.965
I don't know.
June, you're in Rome. July, Washington.

06:46.009 --> 06:50.446
We've postponed it so many times,
we had to pull the kids out of school.

06:50.489 --> 06:54.448
But Vladimir is an important client.
- They all are. When do we

06:54.489 --> 06:58.880
get to be important?
- Maddie, you and the kids are my life.

07:00.209 --> 07:02.518
My life. Come on.

07:07.809 --> 07:11.279
Why take the train? Can't you
just leave later and fly?

07:11.329 --> 07:15.880
Vladimir will not fly.
He's too heavy to leave the ground.

07:18.169 --> 07:22.401
Look, I'm sorry, ok? I...
- You're gonna miss your birthday.

07:22.449 --> 07:25.805
I know.
- We need to spend more time together,

07:25.929 --> 07:28.921
Jacques, as a family.

07:29.969 --> 07:32.961
I love you.

07:38.649 --> 07:42.927
I'll be back soon, ok?
I promise. I love you.

07:42.969 --> 07:45.881
I love you too.

07:45.929 --> 07:50.639
And you stay out of trouble, ok?
Show me what you've got.

07:55.169 --> 07:59.242
Good. One more time. Come on, faster.

07:59.369 --> 08:02.441
Yeah. That's right. Love you.

08:04.369 --> 08:07.008
Love you Dad.

09:20.929 --> 09:24.285
Who are you?
- What did you expect?

09:24.449 --> 09:28.283
I said, who are you?
- Jacques Kristoff.

09:28.489 --> 09:32.448
Go to the stage,
keep your hands where I can see them.

09:32.489 --> 09:38.485
Move to the light, now.
Keep your hands where I can see them.

09:40.729 --> 09:43.880
Walk towards the light.

09:48.209 --> 09:52.521
I wouldn't trust you if your tongue
came notarized. Show me your I.D.

09:52.569 --> 09:55.561
You're sitting on it.

09:57.609 --> 09:59.600
I.D.!

10:02.369 --> 10:05.361
Where's my money?

10:08.369 --> 10:11.486
Here's your money. And passport.

10:12.769 --> 10:16.557
We're taking the 681 to Munich.
- Let's get a few things straight.

10:16.609 --> 10:21.558
You don't tell me what to do.
I don't need you, nor do I want you.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.999
This way.
- No. This is my show.

10:25.209 --> 10:29.521
Galina Konstantin.
- Come on.

10:33.609 --> 10:36.601
We're going up.

10:42.729 --> 10:46.005
Hold your fire. We want her alive.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.526
Stop shooting. Stop shooting.

11:05.089 --> 11:07.080
Jacques.

11:17.769 --> 11:20.841
Don't let her get away.

11:40.809 --> 11:43.004
Sorry, Jacques.

12:32.849 --> 12:36.524
Galina Konstantin is escaped.
- Let's move out of here.

12:36.569 --> 12:39.527
Hey, I just saw that girl.
- Evening, madam.

12:45.929 --> 12:48.921
Sorry. Emergency.

13:42.609 --> 13:44.600
Get down!

14:47.449 --> 14:49.838
Oh shit!

16:20.329 --> 16:23.765
Don't look back. Keep walking.
- Yeah, right.

16:23.969 --> 16:29.805
You want me to play it cool
after you've blown up half of the city?

16:34.969 --> 16:38.439
What are you doing?
- Going to the ladies' room.

16:38.489 --> 16:44.325
Situation calls for a little finesse.
Something you wouldn't understand.

16:44.769 --> 16:47.761
Make it quick.

16:56.089 --> 16:59.240
Hello?
- You call this a babysitting job?

16:59.289 --> 17:02.998
Fast and easy, hm?
- Oh, something went wrong?

17:03.049 --> 17:06.484
Did you hear what I said?
Half the army's on our ass.

17:06.529 --> 17:09.999
But you'll make that train?
- Give me an out.

17:10.049 --> 17:14.008
I told you, there are no other outs.
Now do whatever you have to do

17:14.049 --> 17:18.008
to get on Train 681. You hear me?
Just get across that border.

17:18.049 --> 17:20.040
You got it.

17:39.209 --> 17:41.200
Not bad.

17:42.089 --> 17:45.843
By the way, I won't be needing this.

17:46.089 --> 17:50.048
Due to increased security measures,
all passengers must have their

17:50.089 --> 17:54.048
passports ready for customs inspection.
All packages and luggage

17:54.089 --> 17:58.719
is subject to search.
Thank you for your cooperation.

18:03.129 --> 18:06.121
What do you want?

18:15.929 --> 18:20.605
Ladies and gentlemen. Train 681
to Munich with stops at Linz,

18:20.769 --> 18:24.000
and Salzburg, is now boarding.

18:48.929 --> 18:51.921
Go ahead.

19:06.689 --> 19:10.443
You, come with us.
- What have I done?

19:10.689 --> 19:14.523
Right now.
- What have I done?

19:14.689 --> 19:18.648
Come on.
- Don't...

19:18.689 --> 19:21.840
Hurry up. Where are your papers?

19:23.209 --> 19:26.485
Here.
- You are booked to go to Munich, sir.

19:26.529 --> 19:29.521
Enjoy the train.

19:29.809 --> 19:31.765
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

19:31.809 --> 19:35.279
I'd like to change compartments.
- Yes, sir. But...

19:35.329 --> 19:39.402
Do you have one with large Pullman bed?
This is a very special trip for us.

19:39.449 --> 19:43.408
Thank you madam. I can move you to 1-B.
It's in the next car.

19:43.449 --> 19:46.441
Please follow me.

19:53.969 --> 19:56.961
So, you're a musician, hm?

19:57.849 --> 20:02.001
Musician?
- And you're pretty insightful.

20:02.689 --> 20:07.399
Must be real interesting,
all the songs and such.

20:07.689 --> 20:13.446
Yeah. It's amazing that I can keep
them all straight in my head.

20:13.489 --> 20:16.481
Excuse me.

20:18.289 --> 20:22.521
Shot down? Bad luck, mate.
I'm Angus Reilly.

20:23.489 --> 20:27.721
Bob Sterling, Alexis Oil.
- Oh, really? I'm in oil, too.

20:27.769 --> 20:31.239
Really?
- I'm always tinkering with me bikes.

20:31.289 --> 20:35.248
Keep 'em runnin' smooth. I hope they
loaded me bike on good. It looks like

20:35.289 --> 20:39.248
they just threw it on. Got some pictures
of my bike here. Wanna take a look?

20:39.289 --> 20:43.248
Not really. Bartender, bring my partner
another drink here, would ya?

20:43.289 --> 20:46.008
You Limeys got a good sense of humor.

20:50.689 --> 20:53.567
Train 681 for Munich's now departing.

20:54.649 --> 20:56.640
Nice.

21:28.369 --> 21:31.645
Train 681, Train 681 you are now

21:32.889 --> 21:37.599
being tracked by the Railways
Authority Board. Have a safe trip.

21:45.689 --> 21:49.568
The toughest border on the Eastern bloc.
- That's the first step.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.601
It's the hardest. Let's celebrate.

21:53.689 --> 21:57.398
I'm getting champagne.
- My job is to keep you alive.

21:57.449 --> 22:00.885
That means...
- That I'm under house arrest? In jail?

22:00.929 --> 22:03.966
You sound just like my son.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.367
And I feel very sorry for him.

22:10.089 --> 22:13.240
But you don't know where she is?

22:13.289 --> 22:18.044
I know she did some relief work in
Bosnia for The WHO. They told me that

22:18.089 --> 22:22.526
she could be headed back for a spell.
- But you don't have a...

22:22.569 --> 22:26.244
phone number, an address or an email?
- No.

22:26.529 --> 22:29.487
Fax.
- I lost it, didn't I? They told me

22:29.529 --> 22:33.488
that she caught this very train 3 weeks
ago. I mean I know it sounds cheesy

22:33.529 --> 22:38.319
but you could say that I'm following
in me true love's footsteps.

22:39.249 --> 22:43.083
That is a beautiful story.
Beautiful. Beautiful.

22:44.489 --> 22:48.448
Hey bartender, line 'em up here,
two more right here please, would ya?

22:48.489 --> 22:53.688
Thank you. These are on me. In fact
all the drinks tonight are on me.

22:53.769 --> 22:57.728
Conductor told me,
he'd pick up my bar tab

22:57.769 --> 23:00.920
if I'd switch compartments.
- Sweet.

23:07.849 --> 23:11.808
Miss, can I put this up there?
- Oh, no, no, please, please.

23:11.849 --> 23:17.128
I saved for 10 years to buy this.
- Ok. Keep it right there.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.680
Thank you.

23:35.689 --> 23:39.204
All right, take care, partner.
- I'll see ya.

23:41.169 --> 23:45.242
It's the wrong time for this...
right feeling again.

23:46.009 --> 23:49.922
It's like runnin' in a windstorm,
just can't win.

23:51.129 --> 23:55.680
Looks like winter but it feels
like spring. My mind says no...

23:55.729 --> 23:59.768
But my heart's just singin',
it's the wrong time for the

23:59.809 --> 24:03.484
right feeling again.
See it's the wrong time...

24:17.569 --> 24:21.164
Your attention please.
Train 681 from Bratislava

24:21.929 --> 24:26.719
to Munich is now arriving on Track F.
Your attention please.

24:27.489 --> 24:31.084
Train 681 from Bratislava to Munich

24:32.089 --> 24:35.081
is now arriving on Track F.

24:48.089 --> 24:53.527
Watch your step, miss.
Let me help you with that, sir.

24:58.529 --> 25:00.520
Hey.

25:11.289 --> 25:13.280
Natasha.

25:22.849 --> 25:27.320
I'd appreciate if we weren't bothered.
- Thank you, sir.

25:29.089 --> 25:35.324
Unbelievable. It's the most beautiful
little island I've ever seen.

25:35.369 --> 25:37.325
Safe passage.
- Thank you, Carl.

25:37.369 --> 25:41.203
Your attention, please.
- Hey, what do you want here?

25:47.569 --> 25:49.924
Engine's ours.

25:53.209 --> 25:56.007
I'm rolling.

26:12.609 --> 26:15.601
We're ready, Mason.

26:15.969 --> 26:19.484
You better be ready with the
cell phone blocker, William.

26:20.049 --> 26:23.962
There we go.
- Take your positions. Be calm, be cool.

26:34.129 --> 26:36.120
You got it.

26:49.409 --> 26:51.365
Hello.
- Jacques.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.843
Yes.
- How's the compartment?

26:53.889 --> 26:57.484
Comfy.
- Fine. Now we're all set for Munich.

26:57.529 --> 27:00.566
William, you better be ready up there.

27:02.249 --> 27:05.764
Cell phone blocker's on. Over.
- Hello? Hello?

27:08.329 --> 27:11.446
Sure you don't wanna grab a drink?
- No.

27:14.169 --> 27:17.923
You're no fun, you know that?
- I don't have to be. I'm married.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.960
Really?

27:23.369 --> 27:26.008
I like married men.

27:33.209 --> 27:35.928
I bet you do.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.645
Excuse me. Sorry.
- Thank you.

27:53.169 --> 27:55.160
You're welcome.

28:02.729 --> 28:05.846
Who is it?
- Ticket check.

28:06.969 --> 28:09.961
One moment please.

28:11.209 --> 28:14.201
I'm coming, I'm coming.

28:20.729 --> 28:23.721
Maddie.
- Happy Birthday.

28:23.849 --> 28:27.524
I can't believe you. I can't believe.
- Surprise.

28:27.569 --> 28:30.925
Surprise.
- Say something for the camera, Dad.

28:31.089 --> 28:35.048
We thought we'd surprise you.
Here, here, open your present.

28:35.089 --> 28:39.002
Open it. Dad open it.

28:39.609 --> 28:41.600
Ethan! Ethan!

28:57.529 --> 29:00.487
This is my new client.
- New client?

29:00.529 --> 29:04.681
I'm Galina Konstantin.
- And what exactly do you do?

29:06.809 --> 29:09.846
I'm in acquisitions.
- Acquisition.

29:12.169 --> 29:16.799
Interesting. And you're helping
my husband with what exactly?

29:19.449 --> 29:21.440
I'm...

29:25.089 --> 29:29.048
Maddie! Let me explain.
- Ok. Ok. Start by explaining how

29:29.089 --> 29:33.128
Vladimir ended up looking like that!
- Madeline, it's nothing.

29:33.169 --> 29:37.162
Ok. I'm overreacting. I find my husband
alone with a prostitute at one AM.

29:37.209 --> 29:41.168
She's not a prostitute.
- It hurts that you acted like

29:41.209 --> 29:46.602
you were upset to leave us.
- I was upset. I still am.

29:46.649 --> 29:49.004
Don't. Don't.

29:50.209 --> 29:54.521
20 years together and I never knew
how good you were at lying, Jacques.

29:54.569 --> 29:57.561
Madeline, please listen to me. Please.

29:57.849 --> 30:00.807
I love you. That's the truth.

30:02.369 --> 30:07.682
I'm finding the kids and getting off
the train at the next stop.

30:07.729 --> 30:09.720
Hey. Madeline.

30:19.329 --> 30:21.320
Oh, fuck.

30:26.249 --> 30:30.800
Stay put. Let me try to save
my marriage. Be back in 5 minutes.

30:30.849 --> 30:35.969
I hope I didn't cause any problems.
- Lock the door.

30:46.729 --> 30:49.004
Hey, hey, hey!

30:50.129 --> 30:52.643
Where is she?
- Where is who?

30:53.409 --> 30:57.561
I don't know what you're talking about.
- She's not in 2-C.

30:57.969 --> 31:04.044
She's booked into 2-C. Check again.
- Conductor swapped my room, partner.

31:08.529 --> 31:13.045
Hands up! This way! Move it! Move it!
- Wake up. Wake up!

31:13.089 --> 31:18.561
Wake up and look alive.
Now! Come on! Move it! Move it!

31:18.609 --> 31:21.601
Everybody out!

31:54.289 --> 31:59.363
What I wanna know is what's going on.
Who's that lady with Dad?

31:59.409 --> 32:02.845
Move!
- What are you doing? Take it easy.

32:03.369 --> 32:07.044
Just point the gun at me.
- Move it.

32:18.889 --> 32:22.848
Please, my kids are on this train.
Let me find them. They're not in here.

32:22.889 --> 32:26.723
Lady, sit down or you'll
never see your kids.

32:26.769 --> 32:30.045
Why don't we all try to calm down.

32:34.689 --> 32:36.680
Calm down.

33:00.249 --> 33:02.240
Galina.

33:05.969 --> 33:07.960
Oh shit.

33:25.129 --> 33:27.643
Move lady!

33:34.889 --> 33:38.006
She's not on the train, sir.
- No?

33:40.689 --> 33:46.047
Of course she is. Move the first
class passengers into the bar car.

33:46.089 --> 33:48.967
I'll be there in a minute.
- Let's go!

33:49.089 --> 33:52.764
They're going to kill us all.

34:01.049 --> 34:04.007
Mom.
- Oh thank god. Thank god.

34:04.529 --> 34:08.043
They're my kids. They're my kids.

34:10.329 --> 34:14.004
Are you ok?
Have you seen your father?

34:14.529 --> 34:17.521
He's not with you?

34:39.089 --> 34:42.638
Galina Konstantin.
- Mason's here?

34:43.089 --> 34:46.206
He can't wait to see you.

34:50.849 --> 34:53.841
I don't have anything.

35:13.249 --> 35:15.240
Go ahead.

35:26.169 --> 35:29.161
Keep them calm.

35:31.049 --> 35:34.485
Stop! What are you doing?
- I have to get off.

35:34.529 --> 35:37.487
No!
- Fuck you! I'm getting off!

35:37.529 --> 35:41.681
My family.
- Fuck you. I have to get to Munich.

35:43.209 --> 35:47.202
You'll kill yourself.
- Better than Mason Cole gets me.

35:47.369 --> 35:51.328
Mason Cole?
- He's here on this train.

35:51.369 --> 35:54.327
He finds me, I'm dead.
- Hey.

35:54.369 --> 35:59.238
Shit! Oh shit! Shit! Give that to me!

35:59.289 --> 36:03.282
What in the hell is this?
- None of your business. Don't!

36:03.329 --> 36:08.608
Some kind of drug? What is it?
- Don't. You'll infect all on the train.

36:09.609 --> 36:12.601
A biological weapon?

36:13.649 --> 36:18.006
They call it SP-43. It's a mutated
strain of smallpox mixed in

36:18.049 --> 36:22.486
with several other pathogens.
- You can kill millions with this.

36:22.529 --> 36:25.487
Did Lars know?
- Of course.

36:25.769 --> 36:29.648
He's buying me a ticket to a new life.
- I'm finding my family

36:29.689 --> 36:33.568
and I'm keeping this.
- Give those to me. Lars owes me.

36:33.609 --> 36:36.601
He'll send you a check. Come on.

37:10.449 --> 37:14.203
Please be careful with that.
- French.

37:14.529 --> 37:17.521
Eighteen hundreds I'd say.

37:19.409 --> 37:21.400
No!

37:29.129 --> 37:32.121
Hello my fellow travelers.

37:32.969 --> 37:36.928
Sorry if you're uncomfortable
but I've needed to relocate you

37:36.969 --> 37:40.928
to achieve a goal of mine.
Now I'm not here to make any political

37:40.969 --> 37:44.928
or religious statement.
As a matter of fact,

37:45.009 --> 37:50.606
I'm not here to make any statement
at all. I'm looking for someone.

37:50.649 --> 37:53.925
A woman by the name
of Galina Konstantin.

37:55.809 --> 37:59.324
Any of you men would remember her.

37:59.369 --> 38:03.885
She's quite striking.
She was accompanied by a man,

38:03.929 --> 38:07.683
tall, dark hair. They're on this train.

38:09.689 --> 38:12.886
Perhaps one of you knows where.

38:20.249 --> 38:22.479
You, maybe.

38:24.129 --> 38:26.120
No?

38:27.449 --> 38:32.079
Please do not test my resolve.

38:35.809 --> 38:40.758
I'm going to ask you once again.
Has anyone seen the people

38:40.809 --> 38:43.198
I've described?

38:46.689 --> 38:48.919
Well, if you don't know,

38:50.769 --> 38:54.967
you don't know, do you?
Well if one of you has

38:55.009 --> 38:58.046
a sudden memory flash...

38:58.449 --> 39:03.239
please let me,
or one of my associates, know.

39:07.489 --> 39:11.641
You've got 29 minutes.
Sweep the train. Check the toilets,

39:11.689 --> 39:17.605
check the baggage car, pull up the
goddamn carpets, but find them.

39:35.849 --> 39:37.840
Behind us!

39:48.289 --> 39:51.440
Stop shooting! Stop shooting!

40:36.129 --> 40:39.724
See you can't find good help these days.
- Hand them over.

40:39.769 --> 40:43.842
I don't have anything.
- Please don't insult my intelligence.

40:43.889 --> 40:45.880
Natasha.

40:49.929 --> 40:52.568
She doesn't have it.
- Check him.

41:08.929 --> 41:11.921
That's not it.

41:15.969 --> 41:19.405
That's more like it.
- Those are mine!

41:31.769 --> 41:33.760
Oh, no.

41:35.609 --> 41:38.806
Oh god. I'm dead. We're all dead.

41:44.409 --> 41:47.481
Oh no.
- Henry. Henry. It's ok.

41:48.529 --> 41:52.920
But I could die!
- You're not going to die. Trust me.

41:52.969 --> 41:56.928
We still have jobs to do and we're
gonna do them. Since neither of you

41:56.969 --> 42:00.928
remembers science class, let me remind
you that while this liquid is highly

42:00.969 --> 42:04.928
infectious, we can and are going
to make an antidote, a vaccine.

42:04.969 --> 42:09.759
Why do you think it's so valuable?
But we must proceed exactly as planned.

42:09.809 --> 42:12.846
If you don't I will kill you.

42:13.889 --> 42:18.519
Fritz. We have the package.
Prepare for rendezvous.

42:18.809 --> 42:21.846
Copy that, sir. I'm 15 minutes out.

42:36.089 --> 42:38.080
Mason?

42:38.409 --> 42:42.084
I'm so sorry.
- Natasha, it's ok.

42:43.569 --> 42:46.561
I'll take care of you.

42:55.129 --> 42:58.246
Throw her off the train. And kill him.

43:03.769 --> 43:07.603
Get up Kristoff.
Come on Mr. Kristoff. Come on, now.

43:07.649 --> 43:12.120
You tough, right? Come on, come on now.
Show me what you got. Come on.

43:32.689 --> 43:36.841
If they get it, they'll leave us alone.
- We're witnesses. They'll kill us all.

43:36.889 --> 43:41.758
There's no way we can take 'em all on.
They got guns bigger than I am.

43:41.809 --> 43:45.563
What're you going to do with me, Mason?
- I haven't decided yet.

43:45.609 --> 43:49.887
I could keep you around or scatter you
over the tracks like Monsieur Kristoff.

43:49.929 --> 43:53.968
Are we gonna have a problem here?
- She's scared, that's all.

43:54.009 --> 43:57.968
Didn't your parents tell you
it's impolite to stare?

43:58.009 --> 44:03.037
You're hurting me, Mason.
- Wouldn't want that, would I, Galina?

44:04.849 --> 44:06.840
No. No.
- Ethan.

44:17.089 --> 44:20.968
You thought you could do this job on
your own? When I found you, you were

44:21.009 --> 44:24.888
only a cheap circus tart hustling
the locals. I made you what you are.

44:24.929 --> 44:28.888
I know. I'm sorry. I messed up.
- I gave you everything.

44:28.929 --> 44:33.400
And this is how you repay me?
- Give me another chance.

44:33.449 --> 44:36.805
Please. Mason. We were good together.

44:37.369 --> 44:40.725
I'll make it up to you. I missed you.

45:07.169 --> 45:11.720
Here you go. You call me when we slow
to 40 kilometers, ok?

45:11.809 --> 45:15.961
I need to go check the hydraulic lines.
- You got it.

45:58.089 --> 46:02.241
Please, please, don't kill me.
I will do whatever you say.

46:02.289 --> 46:05.725
I'm not one of them.
Hey, you're the conductor.

46:05.769 --> 46:11.287
Yes, sir. Vincent Gruber.
- Vincent. I need your help.

46:12.409 --> 46:18.166
Listen, I need to get to the engine
to take control of this train.

46:18.529 --> 46:21.999
I can't make it up there, sir.

46:22.969 --> 46:26.962
My leg. But I can help.

46:28.209 --> 46:31.406
I know everything about this train.

46:31.729 --> 46:35.483
Ok, you've got it. Oh Vincent.
- Yes, sir?

46:35.769 --> 46:38.761
Call me Jacques.

46:50.969 --> 46:53.608
We are stopping.
- I'm getting out of here.

46:56.729 --> 46:59.721
Everybody sit down and be calm.

47:51.609 --> 47:56.080
Train 681, Train 681, you appear
to be making an unscheduled stop.

47:56.489 --> 47:59.481
Are you having problems? Over.

48:05.529 --> 48:07.520
Hey. Vincent.

48:12.809 --> 48:17.280
We're losing speed. How to keep moving?
- I think I can tell you.

48:23.729 --> 48:27.688
You're burning up. I'll get you water.
- Mom, I'm fine.

48:27.729 --> 48:29.720
No.

48:34.369 --> 48:39.238
Where do you think you're going?
- I just need some water. For my kids.

48:44.689 --> 48:49.399
Can't you stop that?
- Cynthia? You all right?

49:11.369 --> 49:14.805
Pull the pressure off the brake lines.

49:14.849 --> 49:17.807
Got it.
- Find the fuel compressor.

49:17.849 --> 49:20.807
Is it empty or full?
- Empty.

49:20.849 --> 49:24.637
It's now time to start the engine by
pressing the red button

49:24.689 --> 49:28.648
to your left. Careful!
Give it too much

49:28.689 --> 49:31.681
and you'll rupture the brake lines.

49:40.089 --> 49:43.365
Yes?
- Lars, I'm carrying a bioweapon.

49:43.689 --> 49:47.443
Jacques, slow down, ok?
We had to keep a low profile on this.

49:47.489 --> 49:51.482
Low profile? Mason Cole is on train!
- Mason? Jacques, where are you?

49:51.529 --> 49:56.000
In the engine to keep this train moving.
- Ok, good. Just keep working.

49:56.049 --> 50:00.201
You'll have backup in no time.
- You should know that... Hello?

50:00.249 --> 50:02.240
Hello?

50:03.049 --> 50:07.406
Something is really wrong.
I hurt all over.

50:07.449 --> 50:11.408
We're screwed. Everybody's getting sick.
- Would you shut your mouth? You're not

50:11.449 --> 50:15.408
the only one who's scared here, pal.
- Have your head in the sand, Elton John,

50:15.449 --> 50:19.408
but I don't. Terrorists, plus
sickness, equals biological warfare.

50:19.449 --> 50:22.885
Sir, I'm a doctor.
- I'll bet med school didn't prepare you

50:22.929 --> 50:26.888
for this. Or this. So what is it?
Tell me what your professional

50:26.929 --> 50:30.888
opinion is, Doc. We're fucked.
- I can't help these people

50:30.929 --> 50:34.888
if you keep riling them up.
- Maybe we should all remain calm then?

50:34.929 --> 50:40.287
'Cause pretty soon we're all gonna be
knocking at the Pearly fuckin' Gates.

50:50.529 --> 50:54.363
Mason. Mason!
- You wanna strike out on your own?

50:55.689 --> 51:00.444
Fine. You're on your own.
- Bastard. Don't you leave me here.

51:00.489 --> 51:05.438
Don't leave me. Hard to say, isn't it?

51:06.689 --> 51:09.681
It's time.

51:11.049 --> 51:14.007
How you feeling? Getting ill?

51:15.329 --> 51:19.004
I hope your end is painful.
- Fuck you.

51:21.649 --> 51:24.641
You're already dead.

51:31.089 --> 51:34.843
Vincent. Vincent.
We're stopping. Vincent.

51:36.129 --> 51:40.088
Listen baby, after we kill this fucker
and get all the money,

51:40.129 --> 51:46.125
we're gonna buy our own island.
You hear me? Our own island.

51:55.969 --> 51:59.006
Sir, two of them are on the way.

51:59.729 --> 52:03.688
Slam down the accelerator,
the pressure... pump the fuel...

52:03.729 --> 52:09.326
prime the starter engine... careful!
Give it too much... careful!

52:09.369 --> 52:13.408
Rupture the brake lines!
Prime the starter engine.

52:13.449 --> 52:16.327
He's not here.

52:16.369 --> 52:20.681
Slam down the accelerator...
rupture the brake line... careful!

52:34.729 --> 52:40.804
Stavros, tell me why we're moving.
- I don't know. It started on its own.

52:42.569 --> 52:46.039
Fritz, get back in the air and follow
this train. You're pulling us out.

52:46.089 --> 52:50.480
That's affirmative, sir.
- Looks like the engine's leaking, Mason.

52:50.769 --> 52:53.761
Then fix it!

53:22.409 --> 53:25.003
She was the love of my life.

54:34.449 --> 54:37.885
Fritz. We're having problems
down here. Pull us out.

54:37.929 --> 54:41.046
Copy that. I'm deploying the ladder.

54:44.289 --> 54:48.248
Damn it! There's too much blockage.
It's no good, Mason! I'll get you

54:48.289 --> 54:52.202
on the other side of the mountain.
- Pull us out, now!

54:52.249 --> 54:56.640
No Mason. There's blockage.
- God damn it, do it!

54:59.969 --> 55:04.201
Get up on the roof. Get up to the roof!

55:26.169 --> 55:28.160
Fuck.

55:40.129 --> 55:42.120
Damn it.

55:54.489 --> 55:57.003
Just fucking die!

56:01.769 --> 56:03.760
Fuck. Fuck!

56:43.329 --> 56:46.924
Shit. She's got the vials.
I'll take care of her.

56:46.969 --> 56:51.440
You make sure Kristoff is dead now.
I don't want your word. I want his head!

56:54.169 --> 56:57.844
You need to lie down. Let me help you.

56:58.889 --> 57:03.440
What's wrong with us?
- Ok, that is it! You are out of here!

57:03.489 --> 57:07.448
You're a sicky and you're... I want you
out. You. Move it. Come on, let's go.

57:07.489 --> 57:12.927
Why don't you just get a...
- You're a prince, you know that?

57:17.009 --> 57:20.479
You ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine. It's just a cold.

57:20.529 --> 57:23.726
Since a week. I'm here to help you.

57:25.569 --> 57:28.288
Why don't you get her a glass of water.
- Yeah.

57:28.569 --> 57:32.881
Mom. Mommy. Mom. It hurts so bad.
- Oh baby.

57:39.129 --> 57:43.088
We need to pump liquids into them.
Juice and water. Wet down all the

57:43.129 --> 57:47.088
bar towels and anything else you
can find to make cold compresses.

57:47.129 --> 57:50.007
All right. You got it.

58:02.209 --> 58:05.997
General Zakev? Jacques Kristoff.
- Jacques, how is the vacation?

58:06.049 --> 58:11.123
I'm on Train 681 from Bratislava
to Munich. We've been hijacked...

58:11.169 --> 58:14.161
by Mason Cole.

58:20.289 --> 58:24.328
Any idea why?
- 3 vials of SP-43.

58:24.369 --> 58:28.328
We've had reports that it was stolen
from the Slovakian government.

58:28.369 --> 58:32.840
Consider it confirmed.
It's on this train.

58:34.289 --> 58:39.079
Did you contact Lars?
- Yeah. There has been exposure.

58:39.609 --> 58:45.445
My god. Do you have the vials?
- I'm doing everything I can to get them.

58:48.969 --> 58:54.805
Unless you recover it, stop that train.
- I know the procedure, sir.

58:57.169 --> 58:59.160
Jacques!

59:11.689 --> 59:16.638
We've got to clear the tracks, now.
Then call the WHO.

59:49.169 --> 59:53.401
Lorenzo! He's up here!
Kill him! Kill him!

01:00:25.209 --> 01:00:28.007
No fuckin' way!

01:00:38.609 --> 01:00:41.077
Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

01:00:41.129 --> 01:00:45.407
Do you know what's going on around here?
- I'm not sure.

01:00:45.449 --> 01:00:49.681
Everyone who's sick had to be exposed
at the same time but...

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:53.085
nothing has an incubation
period this short.

01:00:55.769 --> 01:00:59.284
I think it might be smallpox.
- Smallpox?

01:01:00.249 --> 01:01:05.846
But wasn't that wiped out?
- Yeah, it was eradicated back in 1973.

01:01:34.929 --> 01:01:38.126
Kristoff's dead.
- You're sure this time?

01:01:38.169 --> 01:01:43.607
Yeah. I saw him fly off the top
of the train on a motorcycle.

01:01:43.769 --> 01:01:48.160
No way he could have survived.
- You better be right. And Galina?

01:01:48.209 --> 01:01:52.043
No sign.
- I need those vials, Henry.

01:02:12.169 --> 01:02:16.321
Well at this rate I'll be down to me
knickers soon. It's just wrong

01:02:16.369 --> 01:02:19.566
that the young ones have to suffer.

01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:27.768
I can cover myself up if you want.
- No, that's it. Most countries stopped

01:02:27.809 --> 01:02:31.768
inoculating against smallpox in 1979.
We've had our shots.

01:02:31.809 --> 01:02:35.768
So our immune systems still have a
trace of the vaccine. But anyone born

01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:39.768
after that has absolutely no protection.
- So what you're saying is

01:02:39.809 --> 01:02:44.087
that we're safe. We can't get it.
- No, we can. It'll just be delayed

01:02:44.129 --> 01:02:48.520
or not as strong.
- Mom. Mom, get over here.

01:02:52.529 --> 01:02:57.319
Cool her down. I need some room!
Give me some room.

01:02:57.409 --> 01:03:00.003
Good girl. It's ok.

01:03:00.809 --> 01:03:04.643
No! Get ice!
If we don't get this fever down...

01:03:04.689 --> 01:03:08.648
Bob, you need to go help that lady.
- I can't go over there.

01:03:08.689 --> 01:03:12.045
I'm afraid.
- We're all afraid.

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:15.526
Oh come on.
- Angus, please, bring the ice.

01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:24.329
More, more. It's ok. It's ok.
Come on baby.

01:03:30.209 --> 01:03:32.200
No, no...

01:03:37.809 --> 01:03:41.245
Train 420, this is an emergency.
Come in.

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:46.965
Reiner. Reiner. Come in.
- What?

01:03:47.409 --> 01:03:51.721
You must stop your train at Linz.
- What's going on?

01:04:05.129 --> 01:04:07.927
Mom?

01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:13.844
Your fever's broken. Angus, please.

01:04:13.889 --> 01:04:16.687
No problem.
- Pull her out.

01:04:31.289 --> 01:04:33.280
Look out!

01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:39.724
Let me have some medical supplies.
You're responsible for this...

01:04:39.769 --> 01:04:43.000
Don't waste bullets on dead people.

01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:46.320
Mommy?

01:04:54.569 --> 01:04:57.766
Passports. Yours and the brats'. Now!

01:05:05.609 --> 01:05:08.965
Jacques?
- I've got to stop this train.

01:05:13.929 --> 01:05:16.887
The engine's on fire.
Can you shut it?

01:05:16.929 --> 01:05:20.285
I'll try.
- If you can't, get out of there!

01:05:20.769 --> 01:05:24.842
Happy Birthday, Jacques.
I've had my initial consultation

01:05:24.889 --> 01:05:28.643
with the firm of Kristoff...
Kristoff and Kristoff.

01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:32.485
So here's the deal.
You've got 2 minutes

01:05:32.969 --> 01:05:36.928
to get to Compartment 5-B.
And Jacques, I don't like killing

01:05:36.969 --> 01:05:41.360
women and kids, but I will if I have to.

01:05:47.649 --> 01:05:52.279
Don't come any closer. Or I'll shoot
you. I swear to god, I'll shoot you.

01:05:52.329 --> 01:05:56.607
You've got the vials.
- Don't fucking move or I'll kill you!

01:05:56.649 --> 01:06:00.119
You're sick.
- If you had let me go,

01:06:00.169 --> 01:06:04.526
everything would be ok. I would be fine.
- Listen. With the vials

01:06:04.569 --> 01:06:08.960
we can cure you and everybody else.
- It's too late.

01:06:09.929 --> 01:06:14.002
No it's not. You've got to trust me.

01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:16.320
Kristoff.
- Ok?

01:06:16.929 --> 01:06:19.921
30 seconds.
- Ok.

01:06:30.489 --> 01:06:33.481
I'm gonna make things right.

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:44.798
Otto, what's going on?
- That drunken moron hasn't stopped!

01:06:45.729 --> 01:06:50.757
Reiner. Stop the train!
- There's no way to avoid a collision.

01:06:53.649 --> 01:06:56.641
Just a few seconds to go.

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:01.640
3, 2...

01:07:03.209 --> 01:07:05.165
1.
- Jacques.

01:07:05.209 --> 01:07:08.565
Dad!
- Let's put that weapon down, Jacques.

01:07:09.689 --> 01:07:12.681
Drop the clip.

01:07:19.089 --> 01:07:23.321
Let him go.
- I've got a proposition for you.

01:07:23.969 --> 01:07:27.723
As you pretty much decimated my
entire crew, I need someone

01:07:27.769 --> 01:07:33.127
to go find Galina and those vials.
That someone is you.

01:07:33.369 --> 01:07:37.328
Fail and I'll shoot your whole family.
And just to let you know

01:07:37.369 --> 01:07:41.282
I mean business,
I think I'll shoot the boy right now.

01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:44.287
Wait. I've got it. I've got it.

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:47.727
I don't believe you.
- Let Ethan go.

01:07:47.769 --> 01:07:50.761
Give it to me first.

01:07:55.809 --> 01:07:59.768
I must say, you made for a rather
challenging journey.

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:03.404
Why are you doing this?
- I like long vacations.

01:08:04.169 --> 01:08:09.038
Say your prayers.
- What about our deal? Our deal!

01:08:12.329 --> 01:08:15.321
Get the boy!

01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:26.006
Fucking Ethan. Fucking kid.

01:08:28.209 --> 01:08:30.200
Reiner.

01:08:33.249 --> 01:08:35.921
Reiner, come in!

01:08:40.288 --> 01:08:43.326
Fuckin'?
- You must stop!

01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:49.720
No!

01:09:03.448 --> 01:09:06.009
Easy. Easy.
- Careful.

01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:20.645
It must've hit the tail of the train.

01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:32.680
Ethan?

01:09:35.328 --> 01:09:37.319
Ethan!

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:40.600
Ethan!

01:09:42.488 --> 01:09:44.479
Ethan!

01:09:45.969 --> 01:09:47.960
Eth...

01:10:17.449 --> 01:10:20.646
Oh, oh my god, you're hurt.

01:10:23.809 --> 01:10:26.767
It's fine. Leave it.
- No. No.

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:30.807
Leave it!
- No! No! No, Jacques!

01:10:30.849 --> 01:10:34.319
I'm fine.
- 20 years you've lived a different life.

01:10:34.369 --> 01:10:37.361
Our son is dead.

01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:40.721
And our daughter...

01:10:43.209 --> 01:10:46.201
I'm sorry.

01:10:49.449 --> 01:10:52.964
I have to go. They need my help.

01:10:56.089 --> 01:10:59.001
They need my help, too.

01:11:03.889 --> 01:11:07.006
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:11:07.289 --> 01:11:10.281
I love you so much.

01:11:15.449 --> 01:11:19.408
The train is only 50 miles from Munich.
My orders are to be prepared

01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:23.408
for the worst. Are the troops in place?

01:11:23.449 --> 01:11:27.203
Yes, sir. If they reach
the bridge at Charles,

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:31.208
we have a squadron of
Apache gunships in place loaded with

01:11:31.249 --> 01:11:35.242
thermal chemical bombs. Those bombs
carry enough heat to destroy the virus.

01:11:35.289 --> 01:11:38.725
Dr. Reno?
- It's our only choice. If this virus

01:11:38.769 --> 01:11:41.841
gets out millions will die.

01:12:08.369 --> 01:12:12.203
Vincent. We must stop this train.
They will. They have to.

01:12:12.249 --> 01:12:15.207
But the engine...
- We don't need it.

01:12:15.249 --> 01:12:19.322
Let's disconnect it.
- Come on. Come on, I will show you.

01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:23.647
Your husband's a good man.
- How long have you worked with him?

01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:26.681
Since last night.

01:12:27.329 --> 01:12:30.526
No. Your husband's a loyal man.

01:12:37.249 --> 01:12:40.286
Pull the handle.
- Handle.

01:12:40.929 --> 01:12:42.920
That's enough.

01:12:43.809 --> 01:12:48.678
Once we get disconnected
we'll have to use the handbrake.

01:12:50.289 --> 01:12:52.280
Jacques!

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:06.244
Help me. Help me here!
- The brakes!

01:14:06.769 --> 01:14:10.603
Use the brakes.
- Take the handle.

01:14:11.729 --> 01:14:14.687
Any word from Kristoff?
- No, sir.

01:14:14.729 --> 01:14:20.725
Get me NATO Command Center.
I can't give him any more time.

01:14:21.689 --> 01:14:24.681
Take your positions. Over.

01:14:48.969 --> 01:14:51.961
On my signal.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.479
Push. Push.

01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:09.483
It's going.

01:15:24.489 --> 01:15:27.481
Detonate the bridge.

01:15:51.249 --> 01:15:53.240
Yeah! Yeah!

01:16:08.569 --> 01:16:10.560
Yes!

01:16:16.969 --> 01:16:18.960
The car.

01:16:29.409 --> 01:16:32.481
Let's all take this slow.

01:16:37.929 --> 01:16:39.999
Easy now.

01:16:47.009 --> 01:16:49.000
Ethan? Ethan.

01:16:50.249 --> 01:16:53.241
Kept this for you, Dad.
- Ethan.

01:16:56.729 --> 01:16:58.720
Get out!

01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:17.168
Attention all passengers. Ladies and
gentlemen, please remain calm.

01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:21.168
As you can see, the train is
being tented. Once tenting is completed,

01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:25.168
you will be disembarked in an orderly
fashion. We are establishing

01:17:25.209 --> 01:17:29.168
a quarantine area by the side of the
tracks where you will receive medical

01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:34.158
attention. We appreciate your
patience and your cooperation.

01:17:34.209 --> 01:17:38.725
Attention all passengers. Ladies and
gentlemen, please remain calm.

01:17:38.769 --> 01:17:42.728
As you can see, the train is
being tented. Once tenting is completed,

01:17:42.769 --> 01:17:48.924
you will be disembarked in an orderly
fashion. We are establishing...

01:17:49.209 --> 01:17:53.122
Ethan. You were so brave.
I'm proud of you.

01:17:53.529 --> 01:17:56.646
I love you.
- Thanks Dad.

01:17:56.969 --> 01:17:59.961
Excuse me please. Thank you.

01:18:03.849 --> 01:18:07.603
It's gonna be ok, sweetheart.
- I know.

01:18:08.769 --> 01:18:12.444
She's right.
Everything will be fine, baby. Ok?

01:18:16.769 --> 01:18:19.806
I promise. Ok?
- Dr. Reno.

01:18:20.049 --> 01:18:24.008
Dr. Madeline Kristoff. They all had high
fevers, so monitor their temperatures.

01:18:24.049 --> 01:18:28.008
Get them on I.V. Fluids.
- It will be done. Do you know

01:18:28.049 --> 01:18:31.928
if any of the virus had been recovered?

01:18:31.969 --> 01:18:37.805
2 vials of live virus. More than
enough to cure everybody affected.

01:18:37.849 --> 01:18:42.798
Listen. You get better now, you hear?
Soon as you're out of the hospital

01:18:42.849 --> 01:18:47.081
I'm gonna buy you a new fiddle.
- It was a violin.

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:51.919
Sir, I'm going to need some room.
You're going to be fine.

01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:56.326
Shot down again, mate.
- I don't think so.

01:18:58.249 --> 01:19:00.922
Listen, I'm sorry.

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:07.080
I was behaving badly back there and I...
- It's ok, mate.

01:19:07.129 --> 01:19:10.804
Thanks. Maybe when we get out of here
I'll buy you a drink.

01:19:10.849 --> 01:19:14.125
Oh. A drink for me and my lady friend.
- What?

01:19:14.369 --> 01:19:18.328
Didn't I tell you? She works for
the World Health Organization.

01:19:18.369 --> 01:19:20.644
Don't you, Petra?
- Angus?

01:19:23.729 --> 01:19:25.685
Jacques.
- General Zakev.

01:19:25.729 --> 01:19:29.563
Thank god you made it.
- Lars. You came here quickly.

01:19:29.609 --> 01:19:34.922
You're alive. The virus, you have it?
- Yes I do. I just have one question.

01:19:34.969 --> 01:19:38.928
How much you gonna get for the virus?
- What are you talkin' about?

01:19:38.969 --> 01:19:42.928
You're still a little disoriented.
- No, I'm thinking clearly.

01:19:42.969 --> 01:19:46.757
Mason's plan was impossible
without inside information.

01:19:46.809 --> 01:19:50.484
Mason Cole is a topnotch criminal.
- It's more than that.

01:19:50.529 --> 01:19:54.124
You told us to get on Train 681.
- There was no other out.

01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:58.924
There's always. What was with Galina?
- You were on a need-to-know basis.

01:19:58.969 --> 01:20:02.928
It is not the first time this happened.
This is the first time you've caught on.

01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:06.928
Then explain to me how Mason knew
which compartment you booked us in?

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:11.440
You're delusional, you know?
- Delusion this.

01:20:14.449 --> 01:20:18.408
Zakev, arrest this man.
- With pleasure, Jacques.

01:20:18.449 --> 01:20:21.486
Soldiers, take him away.

01:20:22.289 --> 01:20:25.440
Some birthday, Jacques?

01:20:29.329 --> 01:20:32.446
Do I have to tell you
how much I love you?

01:20:33.289 --> 01:20:35.280
No.

01:20:39.569 --> 01:20:42.561
Let's go see the kids.

01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:47.961
Where's Galina?
- Oh, I'm sure she'll turn up somewhere.
