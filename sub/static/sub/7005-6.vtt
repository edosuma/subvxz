00:05.171 --> 00:06.905
Hi, tim.
Hello, heidi.

00:06.906 --> 00:08.907
I got ahold
of the expense report.

00:08.908 --> 00:11.809
You might wanna look at this
before it goes to the boss.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.811
Why do I want to look at it?

00:13.812 --> 00:19.183
Well, check out page two
under the heading
"things tim broke."

00:20.919 --> 00:24.121
Porta-potti, 500 bucks.
Mm, not bad.

00:24.122 --> 00:26.924
Plate-glass window, 275.

00:26.925 --> 00:29.628
Fuse and circuit breakers,
150 bucks?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.562
Look, do me a big favor.

00:31.563 --> 00:34.232
You know that binford 6100
paper shredder?
Mm-hmm.

00:34.233 --> 00:37.469
Why don't you be a good friend
and run this through that?

00:37.470 --> 00:41.172
Well, I can't.
You broke it. 800 bucks.

00:43.575 --> 00:46.311
Well, why don't you
help me out here

00:46.312 --> 00:49.314
And find something
that I haven't broken
and hide it in there.

00:53.986 --> 00:57.255
"and here we have
the complete line
of binford pruners...

00:57.256 --> 01:00.625
The complete line
of binford power pruners...

01:00.626 --> 01:02.627
What are you doing?
I'm rehearsing.

01:02.628 --> 01:04.629
"the complete line
of binford's..."

01:04.629 --> 01:07.465
It's in the script. Look.
Yeah, ok.

01:09.535 --> 01:14.072
I don't know.
Are we demonstrating
the extended version?

01:14.073 --> 01:17.008
We are not.
If you'd read the script,
you would know that.

01:17.009 --> 01:19.711
How am I supposed
to read the script?
It's in pieces.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.746
Hi, boys.
Hi, irma.

01:21.747 --> 01:24.850
So, who's looking forward
to tonight's cable awards?

01:24.851 --> 01:28.353
Well, since you win
everything every year,
I'm guessing you.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.454
I do expect a statue or two

01:30.455 --> 01:33.725
For my special "21 things
you can do with a squash."

01:33.726 --> 01:36.661
I can think of one more.

01:36.662 --> 01:40.031
Oh, tim. You're such
a little scallion.

01:40.032 --> 01:42.066
Well, I'll see you tonight,
boys.

01:42.067 --> 01:44.302
Bye-bye.
Bye.

01:44.303 --> 01:46.971
Sometimes that woman
really steams my rutabagas.

01:46.972 --> 01:49.474
Come on, tim,
don't let irma get to ya.

01:49.475 --> 01:52.009
I think we have
a very good chance this year.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.945
Yeah, right.

01:53.946 --> 01:55.580
Come on, tim.

01:55.581 --> 01:59.217
Turn that frown upside-down.
Come on.

01:59.218 --> 02:02.520
We never win.
We go to the awards show.

02:02.521 --> 02:05.123
We look like
a bunch of losers
sitting there.

02:05.124 --> 02:08.793
The crew gets
all liquored up
and breaks things.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.862
What do you say
we bail out early

02:10.863 --> 02:12.931
And go to eddie's
Halloween party?

02:12.932 --> 02:15.166
We can't insult
the nominating committee.

02:15.167 --> 02:18.169
We can do both.
We'll go to the awards
and then to eddie's party.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.405
There's no point in going
to the awards show.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.674
The judges just don't go
for family tool shows.

02:22.675 --> 02:26.944
They go for those highbrow,
urban, cappuccino/radicchio
shows.

02:26.945 --> 02:30.014
May I remind you that we've done
some excellent episodes?

02:30.015 --> 02:33.250
Pick any show
from "stucco week."

02:33.251 --> 02:36.220
That's powerful television.
That's right.

02:36.221 --> 02:39.724
And who wasn't moved
by our "salute to toilets"?

02:39.725 --> 02:43.995
We had the audience sitting
on the edge of their seats.

02:43.996 --> 02:46.231
We deserve to be there.
That's right, we do,

02:46.232 --> 02:48.132
Because we do
quality television.

02:48.133 --> 02:50.902
I mean, how many shows
teach people how to use
stuff like this?

03:46.092 --> 03:48.960
Why can't I go
trick-or-treating tonight?

03:48.961 --> 03:52.063
'cause you have a fever
and an ear infection.

03:52.064 --> 03:54.232
But how am I gonna get
any candy?

03:54.233 --> 03:56.067
Well, when randy goes out,

03:56.068 --> 03:58.837
He can just ask
for extra candy
for his sick brother.

03:58.838 --> 04:01.539
Mom...

04:01.540 --> 04:04.876
I try that every year.
It never works.

04:04.877 --> 04:07.545
I'll give you a note.

04:07.546 --> 04:12.183
Oh, won't I be cool?

04:13.318 --> 04:14.953
Is he ok?
Hi. Yeah.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.689
Hi, dad.
Hey. Well,
little change in plans.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.358
I decided to go
to the awards banquet
after all,

04:20.358 --> 04:22.360
Then we'll go
to eddie's party.
No, no, no, no.

04:22.361 --> 04:24.462
More change of plans.
We've lost the baby-sitter.

04:24.463 --> 04:26.398
Somebody's gotta stay
with mark.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.899
Randy can stay.
Can't do it, dad.

04:28.900 --> 04:32.837
I'm going trick-or-treating
with a note from my mother.

04:34.273 --> 04:36.374
Hi, mom, hi, dad.
What are you up to
tonight?

04:36.375 --> 04:38.576
I'm just gonna hang out
at jason's.

04:38.577 --> 04:40.277
Hi. I'm jason.
Nice to meet you.

04:40.278 --> 04:41.813
Nice to meet you.
How you doin'?

04:41.814 --> 04:44.416
<i>Tool time</i>
is my favorite show.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.851
Brad tells me kids your age
don't watch it.

04:46.852 --> 04:48.853
Well, I'm a year older
than brad, sir.

04:48.854 --> 04:52.556
I know that <i>tool time</i>
isn't just about tools.

04:52.557 --> 04:56.560
It's a metaphor
for how we live in the '90s.

04:59.765 --> 05:03.935
It is. It is, yes.
Yeah, it is.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.770
I like this kid.

05:05.771 --> 05:08.939
Well, say, if you two
are just hanging out
at jason's,

05:08.940 --> 05:11.642
Why don't you hang out here?
The sitter canceled.

05:11.643 --> 05:13.878
I don't want
to ruin my night
baby-sitting mark.

05:13.879 --> 05:15.880
Don't be selfish.
Help me out here.

05:15.881 --> 05:18.383
It's no big deal.
We can hang out here
and watch tv.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.086
Hey, mr. Taylor,
are the cable awards
being televised?

05:21.087 --> 05:23.187
Absolutely.

05:23.188 --> 05:25.790
Channel 87 are pre-empting
all their programming.

05:25.791 --> 05:28.826
Which consists
of an infomercial
and test pattern.

05:30.295 --> 05:32.196
You are funny!

05:34.500 --> 05:36.968
I bet you could have
your own show, too.

05:36.969 --> 05:39.504
I bet you could run
for office.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.672
It might not be a bad thing

05:41.673 --> 05:44.441
To have a tool man
in the white house.

05:44.442 --> 05:47.044
Maybe he could
fix what's wrong
with this country.

05:47.045 --> 05:49.147
Stick with it,
young man.

05:53.719 --> 05:57.221
Great. Why'd you tell them
we'd stay here alone?

05:57.222 --> 05:59.924
Brad, let me do the math
for you.

05:59.925 --> 06:03.360
No parents, plus you
and senator jason...

06:03.361 --> 06:05.730
Equals party!

06:05.731 --> 06:09.334
My parents would kill me
if they found out
I had a party.

06:09.335 --> 06:13.271
Brad, I know you're just
a measly freshman,
but stick with me

06:13.272 --> 06:17.575
And you'll be a measly freshman
who threw one great party.

06:17.576 --> 06:21.146
And wait till
you meet my friends
page and bridgett. Hello!

06:25.083 --> 06:27.785
You're starting to make
a lot of sense, senator.

06:32.424 --> 06:35.693
And the winner
for best achievement
in sound is...

06:35.694 --> 06:39.431
No surprise here.
<i>Cooking with irma!</i>

06:39.432 --> 06:40.998
<i>(screams)</i>

06:48.673 --> 06:51.309
How on earth does she win
for "sound"?

06:51.310 --> 06:55.146
What kind of sound
does a baked chicken make?

06:55.147 --> 06:56.414
<i>(clucks)</i>

06:56.415 --> 06:59.317
<i>(chokes)</i>

06:59.318 --> 07:03.721
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

07:03.722 --> 07:06.790
This award makes 13.

07:06.791 --> 07:09.293
Or, as we like to say
in my business,

07:09.294 --> 07:11.562
A baker's dozen.

07:15.401 --> 07:19.504
I'll tell you, that woman
really just ticks me -

07:19.505 --> 07:21.439
Congratulations.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.743
You have to admit
her shows are good.

07:25.744 --> 07:28.046
She did that fabulous series
on desserts.

07:28.047 --> 07:31.315
Did you see the two-parter
on the lemon chiffon cake
with a raspberry sauce?

07:31.316 --> 07:32.884
Yes. Weren't you dying?

07:34.586 --> 07:37.822
Excuse me.
Got a minute?

07:37.823 --> 07:39.690
Sorry, tim.
What table
are we sitting at?

07:39.691 --> 07:42.927
The "I love irma" table
is right over there.

07:42.928 --> 07:44.261
Sorry, tim.

07:44.262 --> 07:45.763
Look, I've had it.

07:45.764 --> 07:48.265
I'm gonna get out of here
and go to eddie's party.

07:48.266 --> 07:50.768
You can't
leave the awards show
in the middle of it.

07:50.769 --> 07:52.370
That's poor sportsmanship.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.472
Look at
the <i>knitting with norm</i> table.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.477
Have they won anything
tonight?

08:00.478 --> 08:02.413
No. But they're still here.

08:02.414 --> 08:04.849
Do you want to be
like him?

08:04.850 --> 08:08.686
The man's knitting
a toaster cover in public.

08:08.687 --> 08:11.555
But we can't all get up
and leave at the same time.

08:11.556 --> 08:13.591
You're right.
It would look bad.

08:13.592 --> 08:16.560
Al, you and ilene,
you go to the bathroom,
put your costumes on.

08:16.561 --> 08:18.830
We'll meet you
out in the lobby
in ten minutes.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.565
I don't want to go.
Come on.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.601
There's still
five awards left.
Irma can't win them all.

08:23.602 --> 08:25.836
And now the award
for best lighting.

08:25.837 --> 08:28.238
The winner is...

08:28.239 --> 08:30.575
"irma goes
to the fruit stand."

08:30.576 --> 08:32.010
<i>(screams)</i>

08:32.010 --> 08:33.844
All right,
let's go change.

08:33.845 --> 08:35.346
Come on, let's go.

08:38.784 --> 08:42.320
Brad, you've been
working on your hair
for an hour and a half.

08:42.321 --> 08:46.089
Yeah, but you gotta admit
it was worth it.

08:47.893 --> 08:49.927
What are you doing?
Turning on
the cable awards.

08:49.928 --> 08:52.230
That way,
when your parents get home,
we'll know what happened.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.699
How'd you get so smart?

08:54.700 --> 08:57.969
I've thrown a lot of parties
at other people's houses.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.104
My ear hurts.

09:00.105 --> 09:03.207
I think I have pus.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.575
You're fine.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.945
How would you know?

09:07.946 --> 09:09.513
I'm a doctor.

09:10.949 --> 09:13.450
You're in high school.

09:13.451 --> 09:16.821
I see patients
during recess.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.590
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

09:18.591 --> 09:22.293
That's them. Get ready
for the best night
of your life.

09:22.294 --> 09:24.529
Mark, here's a buck, ok?
Go upstairs.

09:24.530 --> 09:27.464
Best night of your life -
two bucks.

09:30.769 --> 09:35.106
Brad,
this is page and bridgett
and some of their friends.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.976
Hi, brad.
I love your hair.

09:37.977 --> 09:41.746
I haven't even combed it yet.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.915
I brought some cds.
Oh, cool. Which ones?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.984
I got
the new mangled lizards.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.153
Cool! The live album -
<i>mangled in moscow.</i>

09:50.422 --> 09:52.156
<i>(♪ rock)</i>

09:52.157 --> 09:53.992
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

09:53.993 --> 09:56.293
Hey, everybody, quiet!
Parents alert.

09:58.263 --> 10:03.067
Hello? Oh, hi, mom.
Yeah, everything's fine.

10:03.068 --> 10:05.503
Jason, stop tickling me!

10:05.504 --> 10:08.339
No, mom. That was me.

10:08.340 --> 10:10.441
I don't know.
Jason's a tickler.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.645
Yeah, everything's fine.

10:14.646 --> 10:17.514
Have a great time
and don't worry about us.

10:17.515 --> 10:19.851
All right. Bye.

10:19.852 --> 10:23.054
Your parents aren't
coming home early, are they?

10:23.055 --> 10:27.291
No, no. My mom was just
calling and asking about
my little brother's pus.

10:27.292 --> 10:30.528
My little brother's pus.
I love that band.

10:36.735 --> 10:40.638
Next year they should
just move my table
right up on the stage!

10:40.639 --> 10:44.375
Or maybe
just have the ceremony
in your living room.

10:44.376 --> 10:45.576
<i>(cackling)</i>

10:45.577 --> 10:47.979
<i>(imitates</i>
<i>irma's laugh)</i>

10:47.980 --> 10:50.848
<i>(sighs)</i>
what is it - mark?

10:50.849 --> 10:54.218
No, mark's fine.
I'm worried about what else
may be going on at the house.

10:54.219 --> 10:56.353
What else is going on?
Well...

10:56.354 --> 11:00.258
There was a lot of noise,
and jason was tickling brad.

11:02.027 --> 11:04.228
Maybe we should go home.

11:04.229 --> 11:07.864
If jason's tickling brad,
I don't want to go home.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.836
I just don't like that jason.
He's just too smooth.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.838
He's a good kid.

11:13.839 --> 11:17.742
If it weren't for him,
brad wouldn't be glued
to the tv right now.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.143
Hey, brad.

11:19.144 --> 11:21.879
<i>Hey, brad!</i>
<i>How are you doing?</i>

11:32.758 --> 11:35.326
And now the award
for the best show.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.461
The nominees
are <i>knitting with norm</i>

11:37.462 --> 11:40.331
For his special
on japanese sweaters -

11:40.332 --> 11:43.167
"tora! Tora! It's angora."

11:45.971 --> 11:51.575
<i>Cooking with irma</i>
for her christmas special,
"home for the hollandaise."

11:54.413 --> 11:57.181
I can't take
any more of this.
Let's just go. Come on.

11:57.182 --> 12:00.485
And <i>tool time</i>
for their salute to engines -

12:00.486 --> 12:03.053
"I shoulda had a v-8."

12:03.054 --> 12:04.989
And the winner is...

12:04.990 --> 12:06.824
<i>Tool time!</i>

12:06.825 --> 12:10.160
<i>Tool time!</i>
We won.

12:10.161 --> 12:13.965
Al, get out
of the bathroom!
We won best show!

12:19.271 --> 12:24.208
It's about time
someone took us seriously.

12:24.209 --> 12:26.544
Ilene, we won.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.512
Oh, you did?

12:28.513 --> 12:30.414
Congratulations...
Oh!

12:33.619 --> 12:37.254
Come on, fur ball.
Let's go get our award.

12:37.255 --> 12:39.623
I can't go up there
looking like this.

12:39.624 --> 12:43.227
What are you,
a man or a mouse?
Come on, buddy!

12:46.932 --> 12:50.034
Well, I guess
you feel pretty silly
right about now.

12:53.338 --> 12:58.042
Um... It's hard to say
how much thanks we have
from everybody at <i>tool time,</i>

12:58.043 --> 13:02.547
Which, of course, is a...
A-a show that is a metaphor

13:02.548 --> 13:06.050
For how we live our lives
in the '90s.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.552
I want to...

13:07.553 --> 13:11.455
Everybody from binford tools,
I want to thank heidi,
of course,

13:11.456 --> 13:15.325
My crew, if they can hear me
out at the bar,

13:15.326 --> 13:18.863
My three boys for inspiration,
and who am I missing? Um...

13:18.864 --> 13:21.432
Your wife.
My wife. I'm sorry.

13:21.433 --> 13:24.268
And most of all,
this man next to me,
al borland,

13:24.269 --> 13:29.706
Whose professionalism
and class and dignity

13:29.707 --> 13:33.210
Has been an inspiration
to many of us.

13:33.211 --> 13:35.212
Thank you, tim.

13:35.213 --> 13:37.948
I, uh...
Well, I just want to say

13:37.949 --> 13:40.517
That... That this proves

13:40.518 --> 13:44.154
That dreams
really can come true.

13:44.155 --> 13:47.291
When I started out
in this business,

13:47.292 --> 13:50.827
Well, I... I lived
in a hole in the wall.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.166
But...

13:55.167 --> 13:57.935
Well, I want to say,
did I give up?

13:57.936 --> 14:01.505
Did I run away with my tail
between my legs?

14:01.506 --> 14:03.707
No! No! I went on...

14:03.708 --> 14:06.810
And on and on and on.

14:06.811 --> 14:08.912
From both of us,
thanks very much,
and good night.

14:08.913 --> 14:10.014
Thank you.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.648
Thank you.

14:11.649 --> 14:13.718
Well, congratulations, buddy.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.886
Now you have something
to put on your mantel

14:15.887 --> 14:18.489
Instead of that big picture
of your mom you blew up.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.324
That wasn't blown up.

14:22.627 --> 14:24.962
Let's see.
Let me see.

14:24.963 --> 14:26.964
<i>(♪ rock)</i>

14:35.574 --> 14:39.142
I love this music.
Who is it?
The bloated jellyfish.

14:43.348 --> 14:46.150
Hey, I'm out.
You got any butts?

14:46.151 --> 14:49.520
Just one.
And don't even think
about lighting it up.

14:58.763 --> 15:00.264
Brad?

15:06.271 --> 15:10.006
What is going on here?
A few friends dropped by.

15:10.007 --> 15:12.109
Great. Candy.
Let's see what you got.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.777
Hey, that's mine.
Give it back.

15:13.778 --> 15:15.145
In your dreams.

15:15.146 --> 15:17.781
Brad, you want
to help me out here?

15:17.782 --> 15:19.951
I'm a little busy
here.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.753
We'll help you out.
Hey...

15:22.754 --> 15:24.788
This is not good.
Help!

15:26.191 --> 15:29.493
Hey, brad, who's the guy
with the pumpkin on his head?

15:35.100 --> 15:38.102
A guy who can get me
in a lot of trouble

15:38.103 --> 15:39.603
If he tells my parents.

15:39.604 --> 15:41.372
I'll be back.

15:46.077 --> 15:48.579
Hey, wilson.
How's it going?

15:56.888 --> 15:59.990
I'm gonna get you
for this, brad.

16:01.326 --> 16:04.261
I thought you went
to a Halloween party.

16:04.262 --> 16:07.664
Well, actually,
I got back about
a half an hour ago.

16:07.665 --> 16:09.900
Seems you're having
quite a party over there.

16:09.901 --> 16:12.336
Actually, it's not a party.

16:12.337 --> 16:14.638
I just had
a few friends over.
Hmm.

16:14.639 --> 16:18.008
Last time I counted,
it was 37.

16:18.009 --> 16:20.377
Ah. 39.

16:22.714 --> 16:24.715
You saw the whole thing?

16:24.716 --> 16:27.118
Actually, brad, I heard it,

16:27.119 --> 16:28.385
And I must admit

16:28.386 --> 16:31.155
The melodic appeal
of bloated jellyfish
escapes me.

16:31.156 --> 16:34.358
You see, I find them
quite derivative of
my little brother's pus.

16:35.794 --> 16:39.030
You're not gonna tell
my parents, are you, wilson?

16:39.031 --> 16:41.031
Oh, brad, brad, brad.

16:41.032 --> 16:43.834
You put me
in such a quandary.

16:43.835 --> 16:46.770
On the one hand,
is it a neighbor's place

16:46.771 --> 16:48.839
To get his friend's son
in trouble?

16:48.840 --> 16:50.841
And then on the other hand,

16:50.842 --> 16:54.078
I'm reminded of the roman
quintus horatius flaccus,
who said,

16:54.079 --> 16:59.350
"for it is your business
if your neighbor's wall
catches fire."

16:59.351 --> 17:01.118
Yeah, but what about the words

17:01.119 --> 17:03.120
Of a great american,
mister rogers?

17:03.121 --> 17:06.857
He said,
"won't you be my neighbor?"

17:08.960 --> 17:14.598
Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, hmm-hmm.

17:19.003 --> 17:21.271
<i>(jill)</i> what is going on here?

17:25.042 --> 17:27.611
<i>(tim)</i> give me that beer!
Who are these kids?

17:27.612 --> 17:30.814
Hey, lancelot,
what are you doing here?

17:32.550 --> 17:35.085
Puff and I
own this castle.

17:37.989 --> 17:41.125
I told you we should come home
and find out what's going on.

17:47.098 --> 17:48.766
Mom? Dad?

17:51.602 --> 17:53.571
You guys
came back early.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.739
What are all these kids
doing in the house?

17:55.740 --> 17:58.642
Mostly torturing me.

17:58.643 --> 18:00.711
Where's brad?

18:00.712 --> 18:03.781
Well, gee, I don't want
to get brad in trouble,

18:03.782 --> 18:07.083
But check over there
by the beer cans
and the cigarette butts.

18:08.286 --> 18:10.754
<i>(jill)</i> brad!

18:10.755 --> 18:12.789
Brad!

18:12.790 --> 18:13.957
<i>Brad!</i>

18:15.159 --> 18:19.963
You are
in so much trouble!

18:25.804 --> 18:29.139
And you know she means it.
You can tell by the look
on her face.

18:32.810 --> 18:35.879
<i>(jill)</i> all right,
let's go back
to the beginning.

18:37.381 --> 18:39.382
Whose idea was this -
jason's or yours?

18:39.383 --> 18:41.218
It couldn't
have been jason's.

18:41.219 --> 18:43.954
He's a <i>tool time</i> fan.
They know the difference
between right and wrong.

18:43.955 --> 18:45.956
Have you not
figured out yet that

18:45.957 --> 18:48.125
That kid was conning you
the whole time?

18:48.126 --> 18:49.793
<i>Tool time</i> fans
don't con.

18:49.794 --> 18:52.763
He's not
a <i>tool time</i> fan.

18:52.764 --> 18:56.433
You never answered
my question.
Whose idea was this?

18:56.434 --> 18:58.068
Jason's.

18:58.069 --> 18:59.903
But you went along
with it.

18:59.904 --> 19:02.005
We give you responsibility,
this is what happens?

19:02.006 --> 19:04.174
Hey, I didn't want
any responsibility.

19:04.175 --> 19:07.211
Ok. We'll remember that
in two years when you want
your driver's license.

19:07.212 --> 19:12.082
By then I might be ready
for some responsibility.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.050
We'll be the judge
of that.

19:14.051 --> 19:16.954
Did it ever occur to you
to just say no?

19:16.955 --> 19:19.756
Yes. But I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

19:19.757 --> 19:21.758
Well, it is a big deal.

19:21.759 --> 19:24.261
You had a sick brother.
The house is a mess.

19:24.262 --> 19:26.263
There are
cigarette burns
on the couch.

19:26.264 --> 19:29.099
What about this alcohol?
They brought it.
There's nothing I can do.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.701
I don't want your friends
bringing alcohol
into this house.

19:31.702 --> 19:33.704
I wasn't drinking.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.539
Everybody was under age.
I don't care whether
you were drinking or not.

19:36.540 --> 19:40.010
You know if anything happened
to these kids, puff and I
would be responsible?

19:44.382 --> 19:47.250
Ok. I'm sorry, ok?
I guess I wasn't thinking.

19:47.251 --> 19:50.320
You should have,
but now you're gonna have
a month to think about it,

19:50.321 --> 19:52.489
'cause that's how long
you're grounded.

19:52.490 --> 19:54.891
A month?
That's right. A month.

19:54.892 --> 19:57.060
You might as well
begin right now

19:57.061 --> 19:59.963
By cleaning this mess up.

19:59.964 --> 20:02.132
Mr. Taylor. Hi.

20:02.133 --> 20:06.102
Page and I were just in here
looking for the... Vacuum.
Is this where you keep it?

20:07.671 --> 20:09.339
Get out here, jason.

20:11.176 --> 20:15.112
I want the truth,
and I want it right now.
One chance to come clean.

20:15.113 --> 20:18.048
Are you or are you not
a <i>tool time</i> fan?

20:21.152 --> 20:25.322
I've never seen the show
in my life.

20:28.627 --> 20:32.362
<i>(imitates tin man)</i>
now I know I have a heart,
because it's broken.

20:38.569 --> 20:40.570
Good morning.
Morning.

20:40.571 --> 20:43.240
I see you're still clutching
that award.

20:43.241 --> 20:46.043
I didn't realize
I had it with me.

20:46.044 --> 20:49.346
You took it in the shower
this morning.

20:49.347 --> 20:52.549
You know, it took me
a long time to get this.
This means a lot to me.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.953
I know, honey,
and I think it's real cute.

20:55.954 --> 20:59.556
I just hope
that we don't have to sleep
with it again tonight.

20:59.557 --> 21:03.260
No. I'm gonna make it
a little bed.

21:03.261 --> 21:05.529
Where's brad?

21:05.530 --> 21:07.430
Oh.

21:07.431 --> 21:09.532
He's out raking the yard.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.869
Then I'm gonna have him
clean the attic.

21:11.870 --> 21:15.405
You think he's actually
gonna learn anything
from all this?

21:15.406 --> 21:18.842
When you did something wrong
and your parents punished you,
did you learn anything?

21:18.843 --> 21:21.745
No. Except to try harder
not to get caught.

21:21.746 --> 21:24.381
Yeah. Same with me.

21:24.382 --> 21:26.983
This is the point in my life
my mother was waiting for.

21:26.984 --> 21:31.688
<i>(feminine voice)</i> one day
I hope you have a little boy
just like you!

21:34.159 --> 21:36.793
My mom said
the exact same thing.

21:36.794 --> 21:40.064
I can't believe
it's actually come true.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.666
So what do we do?

21:42.667 --> 21:46.369
I guess we just keep trying
to be the best parents
we can be,

21:46.370 --> 21:48.505
Have a little faith...

21:48.506 --> 21:54.111
Hope that someday
he has a kid just like him.

21:58.082 --> 22:00.183
When I started out
in this business,

22:00.184 --> 22:03.319
Well, I... I lived
in a hole in the wall.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.491
But...

22:07.492 --> 22:10.026
Well, I want to say,
did I give up?

22:10.027 --> 22:13.764
Did I run away with my tail
between my legs?

22:13.765 --> 22:16.065
No! No! I went on...

22:16.066 --> 22:19.202
And on and on and on.

22:19.203 --> 22:21.938
From both of us,
thanks very much.
And good night.

22:21.939 --> 22:22.906
Thank you.
