- MIKE: 'Cause he wanted me to.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.017
- Why would he want that, Mike?
- I don't know.

00:17.017 --> 00:21.021

out before someone else does.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.260
You know what it means
when rival gangs group together?

You know what that means.

you want a great meal.

what you want, right?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.872
I want to be the happy family

06:13.774 --> 06:16.309

it fucking over with.

- Sit the fuck down!

06:44.337 --> 06:45.873
Have some breakfast.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.542
You didn't ask about my
day, so let me tell you.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.344
I'm being interviewed today
about a student who stabbed

06:51.344 --> 06:54.815
a prison guard in the neck
30 times with a pencil.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.350
He's the nephew of one
of your brother's friends--

06:57.350 --> 06:58.986
one of your friends,

06:58.986 --> 07:01.354
who was also
stabbed to death last night.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.123
And now you're rushing
out of the house--

07:03.123 --> 07:05.292
- KYLE: I'm not
rushing out of here.

07:05.292 --> 07:09.262
I've got an inmate transfer at
8:00 AM, 30 minutes of traffic,

07:09.262 --> 07:12.833
and I got 30 minutes
of red tape at the prison.

07:12.833 --> 07:17.605
I'm just--I'm late.
I gotta go.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.907
And, you know,
I know what you're doing.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.842
And you are right.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.745
It is a giant mess, but
we are trying to clean up.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.879
- MARIAM: It's your
brother's mess.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.348
- KYLE: It's everybody's mess!

07:28.348 --> 07:30.651
Every decision in this place
is the lesser of two evils.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.285
Every fucking one.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.488
And I don't get to choose
between right and wrong because

07:34.488 --> 07:36.557
that choice, it's never offered.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.826
- You know your son's due date?

07:41.495 --> 07:43.263
- Why do you say "son"?

07:43.263 --> 07:46.066
- Because I saw him
on the ultrasound

07:46.066 --> 07:48.702
at the doctor's appointment
you couldn't make.

07:48.702 --> 07:52.540
February 29th.
He's a leap year baby.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.107

07:54.107 --> 07:58.045
- MARIAM: She was looking for
the right time, like breakfast.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.047
But you wouldn't give her that.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.717
You know, what
she dreams about at night

08:03.717 --> 08:05.886
she expects to come true
in the day.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.589
And it's just a simple dream,
Kyle.

08:08.589 --> 08:13.126
It's a husband who'd rather
be with her than anywhere else,

08:13.126 --> 08:15.362
who can't wait to be a father,

08:15.362 --> 08:20.400
who can't wait to go shopping
for stuffed elephants and cribs.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.735
- KYLE: You're right.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.470
I need to make
more time for her.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.807
- MARIAM: That'll solve
absolutely nothing.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.542
You say you have
no good choices.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.511
The only good thing in your life
just walked out of the room.

08:31.511 --> 08:36.950
All this filth that consumes
you, just couldn't leave it.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.552
Choose her.

08:38.552 --> 08:41.454
If you don't have the courage
to do that, then divorce her,

08:41.454 --> 08:44.024
and let her find somebody
who does love her.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.660
Do it quick,
before you get killed

08:46.660 --> 08:48.929
and she martyrs you
in her mind

08:48.929 --> 08:51.431
and raises another
generation of fool

08:51.431 --> 08:52.733
in this family.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.635

divorcing my wife.

Yeah. Now it's ready.

A goldfinch, to be exact.

But that's not one of them.
That's a goldfinch.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.677

when they fucking named it.

13:36.716 --> 13:40.320
Mm, what is this?

- Are you German?
- No, I'm Irish.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.695
The only thing German
is that pancake.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.463
- It's good.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.369
You should be a chef.

from the shoulder.

Pete, back it up.

Do you see that?

The other inmate is white.

15:06.873 --> 15:10.543
I doubt one of the whites
would willingly arm a black man.

black inmate is beat to death

15:24.524 --> 15:25.725
or shot on the yard?
If anything,

15:25.725 --> 15:28.728
both instances
improve their position.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.064
Look, if we have inmates
crossing racial lines

15:31.064 --> 15:33.466
to get at a guard,
we've got a real fucking problem

15:33.466 --> 15:35.035
because you know what's next.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.037
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Why are you worried about it?

15:37.037 --> 15:40.907
What makes today different
than any other goddamn day?

15:40.907 --> 15:46.879
- Look, Warden. [sighs]

15:46.879 --> 15:50.083
Samuel Weaver had been
tricked into mailing a letter

15:50.083 --> 15:51.584
for the inmate
that attacked him.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.721
Now, we believe they feel
Darryl's death was retribution

15:54.721 --> 15:56.489
for that action.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.091
- Was it?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.161
Was it?

16:01.161 --> 16:03.963
- The QRT unit's actions
were justified, sir,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.632
based on the situation
they encounter, which--

16:05.632 --> 16:08.568
- Well, the inmates certainly
don't think it was justified.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.071
How do you explain that?

16:11.071 --> 16:13.906
- Here's how you
explain it, sir.

16:13.906 --> 16:17.210
They're lying, stealing
murderers who haven't taken

16:17.210 --> 16:20.313
responsibility for anything
in their entire fucking lives.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.316
And legitimizing their
complaints was the worst thing

16:23.316 --> 16:25.752
you could have done.
They should be on lockdown

16:25.752 --> 16:27.687
until they've served
their fucking sentences.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.089
- Ed--
- I'm sorry, sir,

16:29.089 --> 16:31.258
but Tim was my friend and
his nephew was a good kid.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.160
And they don't
deserve what they got.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.028
And if we don't put the
screws to these motherfuckers,

16:35.028 --> 16:37.364
they will do it again
and again and again.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.066
They won't stop!

16:42.769 --> 16:44.437
- Captain Moore, you
have an opinion on this?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.339
- Yes, sir, I do.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.676
We should lock the prison down,
move the suspects to county,

16:49.676 --> 16:50.843
where homicide detectives

16:50.843 --> 16:53.146
can question them
and prepare charges.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.048
We must send a message, sir.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.484
It must be hard
and it must be fast.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.689
- You can transfer the
suspects to county.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.057
But we are not locking
the prison down.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.158
- CAPTAIN MOORE:
That's a mistake, sir.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.626
- WARDEN: I gave my word.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.761
I will not reprimand the
innocent to punish the guilty.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.064
- When you say "innocent,"
sir, who are you referring to?

17:11.064 --> 17:12.965
- Who the hell do you
think I'm referring to?

17:12.965 --> 17:14.201
The other inmates.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.569
- There are no
innocent inmates, sir.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.871
That is why they're here.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.342
- No lockdown.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.344
- [door shuts]

17:24.344 --> 17:26.479
- What the fuck was that?
- I had to give him something.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.516
- No, no, you don't have to
give that politician anything.

17:34.121 --> 17:39.426
Get in the habit of keeping
our secrets, Kareem...

17:39.426 --> 17:41.794
because they will throw us in
here with these motherfuckers

17:41.794 --> 17:44.631
if you give 'em any more.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.832
- Are you, uh...

17:45.832 --> 17:47.867
Are you giving me
an order, Sergeant?

17:47.867 --> 17:49.936
- No, man, it's not an order.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.272
It's, um...

17:52.272 --> 17:56.643
It's advice between
friends, you know?

17:56.643 --> 17:59.112
So friend to friend...

17:59.112 --> 18:01.013

- Nah, if we told you, you
wouldn't fucking believe us.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.473
- You aware of this?
- Let me see.

21:16.909 --> 21:20.980
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we brought him up.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.315
Bring them through.

what can I fucking tell ya?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.635
All right.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.771

right this way.

21:44.771 --> 21:51.277
- *

21:55.114 --> 21:57.717
- Isn't this a violation
of her Miranda rights?

21:57.717 --> 21:58.751
- She's in prison.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.387
She doesn't have
Miranda rights in here.

22:00.387 --> 22:01.921
- You're her counselor.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.923
There's an element of trust
in place between the two of you

22:03.923 --> 22:05.658
that we do not have.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.595
- You have a lot to
learn about inmates.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.897
- A corrections officer
has been killed

22:10.897 --> 22:13.132
and posthumously accused
of rape.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.767
That has consequences
for his next of kin

22:14.767 --> 22:17.470
regarding life insurance
as well as pension benefits.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.238
- Will you do it?
- I have a class.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.807
- They get to play hooky today.

22:20.807 --> 22:24.911
- Hooky is something people
with better options play.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.779
These girls have no options.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.415
I have a class to teach.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.082
I'm not going to miss it.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.350
- We better get going, then.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.120
- What is it you're
hoping I discover?

22:34.120 --> 22:36.322
- There was no tearing
of the vaginal wall.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.425
No scratches on
his face or arms.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.627
No visible signs of a
struggle on her body.

22:40.627 --> 22:43.663
- Pencil stab to the neck
30 times seems evidence

22:43.663 --> 22:44.931
of a struggle.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.666
- Those were offensive wounds.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.167
She suffered no
defensive wounds.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.702
None.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.704
That, coupled with the fact
that his uncle was killed

22:51.704 --> 22:55.775
at almost the exact same time...
we question it.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.110
- Question what?
- The claim of self-defense.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.146
- Well, that means you
question the rape.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.314
- Yes. We question it.

23:02.314 --> 23:05.885
- So you think a 20-year-old
girl lured a guard into

23:05.885 --> 23:10.322
the hallway, willingly had sex
with him so she could kill him?

23:10.322 --> 23:11.724
- That's exactly what we think.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.093
- We think it was a hit.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.562
We think it was gang sanctioned.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.233
- I won't lie to her.
I won't threaten her.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.502
- Mrs. McClusky--

23:22.502 --> 23:26.506
- Ms. McClusky.
I'm a widow. Ms.

23:26.506 --> 23:30.076
Ms. McClusky, if we
wanted to threaten and lie,

23:30.076 --> 23:32.278
we would do it ourselves.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.646
But inmates are immune
to our lies

23:33.646 --> 23:35.314
and they're immune
to our threats.

23:35.314 --> 23:36.583
- Just asked her what happened.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.884
Question the things that
don't add up

23:37.884 --> 23:40.920
and show her the compassion
you're known for.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.288
- Compassion?

23:42.288 --> 23:44.356
- It's one tactic
we haven't tried.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.826
- We don't have it.
That's why you're here.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.404

ultrasound and everything?

24:10.249 --> 24:11.450

24:11.450 --> 24:13.452
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.755
- What are you gonna name him?

24:15.755 --> 24:17.957
- Mitch.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.559
- That's good, Kyle.
He'd love that.

24:19.559 --> 24:22.461

24:22.461 --> 24:24.697
I'm taking the job with MSP.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.833
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.639

I don't know the fuck you
are gonna pass the polygraph,

24:34.574 --> 24:36.609
but I'm happy for ya.

24:36.609 --> 24:37.810

talk low, brother.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.212

24:40.212 --> 24:42.849
How do you memorize
all those fucking keys?

24:42.849 --> 24:44.216

memorize all those colors?

I can't fucking see.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.795
Buddy, the outer
doors are locked.

We gotta go deeper inside.

- Okay?

Thank you.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.143
- What are you doing here?

36:18.143 --> 36:20.011
- They want me to, uh...

36:20.011 --> 36:21.847
They want me to ask
you what happened.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.250
- I already told
them what happened.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.751
- Well, they want
different answers.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.553
- I only got the answers I gave.

36:27.553 --> 36:30.322
- They still want
different ones.

36:30.322 --> 36:33.825
They want me to question you and
listen for any inconsistencies,

36:33.825 --> 36:36.528
and then question you
about the inconsistencies.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.097
And because you know me,
they think you trust me

36:39.097 --> 36:40.732
and you'll finally
tell me the truth

36:40.732 --> 36:44.069
because they think that
the truth is like a disease

36:44.069 --> 36:46.505
that rots inside you and
the only way to cure it

36:46.505 --> 36:49.775
is to let it out.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.077
- That what you believe?

36:52.077 --> 36:54.313
- Well...

36:58.083 --> 37:01.387
Depends on the truth, I guess.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.754
- Truth.

37:02.754 --> 37:07.659
Man, I don't even know
what the fuck that word means.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.861
Know why?

37:09.861 --> 37:14.566
'Cause y'all keep changing
the fucking definition.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.602
Was it the truth when I said
my foster parent like to stick

37:16.602 --> 37:20.572
his fingers in me while
he read me the Bible?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.908
Yeah.

37:22.908 --> 37:27.679
They didn't like that truth,
so they decided it wasn't.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.781
Foster parents decided the
Bible don't have a problem

37:29.781 --> 37:34.520
with abortion after all when
it's his baby in my stomach.

37:34.520 --> 37:38.324
Got no problem with
cutting it out then.

37:38.324 --> 37:42.193
So what's the truth?

37:42.193 --> 37:45.631
I know what the truth is.

37:45.631 --> 37:49.301
It's a version of the story
that keeps me down

37:49.301 --> 37:52.938
and everybody like me.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.541
That's all the fucking truth is.

37:59.445 --> 38:02.280
So what truth y'all want today?

38:02.280 --> 38:04.583
- They want the truth that
clears the name of the guard

38:04.583 --> 38:07.986
so his family can get life
insurance and any contributions

38:07.986 --> 38:11.256
he may have made
to his pension fund.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.224
- His family get money
from him being dead?

38:13.224 --> 38:15.461
- Not if he committed a crime.

38:17.996 --> 38:21.367
Did he?
Did he commit a crime?

38:24.302 --> 38:30.208
Don't answer me out loud.
They're recording us.

38:30.208 --> 38:34.780
Just tell me with your eyes.

38:34.780 --> 38:38.750
- Goddamn right he did.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.919
- Okay.

38:40.919 --> 38:49.495
- *

38:49.495 --> 38:54.400
- Ms. McClusky?
- Yeah?

38:54.400 --> 38:58.904
- Look at that.
I feel better already.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.412

- Good, you're good.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.097
You're okay, you're all right.

39:26.097 --> 39:27.198
You're okay.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.233

39:28.233 --> 39:31.637
- [both panting]

39:36.174 --> 39:38.376
- Fuck.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.046
- Shit. Fuck.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.582
- Aw, there's no way out.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.117
- [loud thud]
- [cracking]

39:46.117 --> 39:49.688
- Oh my god.
Hey, hey, hey!

39:51.022 --> 39:52.591
- [prisoners shouting]

39:52.591 --> 39:55.594

40:09.941 --> 40:11.510
You're good, you can do this.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.083
All right, this is septic here.
Let's follow it out.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.785
Come on, come on.
- Okay.

40:19.785 --> 40:24.490
- *

40:40.105 --> 40:42.073
- No, man, that won't do.

40:42.073 --> 40:45.844
- Let's see your fucking hands.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.913
- We're all down here
for the same reason.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.347
We're hiding too.

40:49.347 --> 40:50.616
- Is there a way out of here?

40:50.616 --> 40:52.117
- It's the end of the road.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.619
- Why are you hiding from them?

40:53.619 --> 40:57.823
- Got old scores
being settled up there.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.424
- All right, we're
gonna find a way out.

40:59.424 --> 41:02.594
- There ain't one.
- We're gonna fucking try.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.663
- It's a free country.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.832
For a little while, anyway.

41:06.832 --> 41:12.771
- *

41:12.771 --> 41:14.706
- We're just gonna leave them?
- We've got no fucking choice.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.141
- One of them gets to the top,

41:16.141 --> 41:18.376
we are how old scores get
settled.

41:18.376 --> 41:20.478
- They're fucking
child molesters, Kyle.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.814
Those scores do not get settled.
Now, come on.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.886
Come on.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.347

Come on, let's go.

Keep it moving.

42:10.095 --> 42:12.530
Let's go! Let's move!

42:12.530 --> 42:13.965
This way, this way!

42:51.903 --> 42:54.105
- MIKE: Probably
about 7:00, I guess.

42:54.105 --> 42:58.309
- I like having you here.

42:58.309 --> 43:02.648
You know, if you think about it,

43:02.648 --> 43:06.251
people have been bathing longer
than they've been making fire.

43:06.251 --> 43:09.855
It sort of just demystifies the
body when you see someone bathe.

43:09.855 --> 43:12.624
Removes sexuality
from it, I guess,

43:12.624 --> 43:14.492
and restores humanity.

43:14.492 --> 43:17.295
- [water splashing]

me like I'm broken.

I'm not broken.

43:35.947 --> 43:46.424

43:46.424 --> 43:48.159
- Look, Iris...

43:49.394 --> 43:53.098
You don't owe me anything, okay?

43:56.001 --> 43:58.937
I want you to understand that.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.706
Nothing.

44:00.706 --> 44:03.274
I'm not the one that saved you.

44:04.876 --> 44:12.851
- *

44:12.851 --> 44:18.289
- You know...I had 100 guys
swear that they'd die for me.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.529
None swear to kill.

44:24.529 --> 44:28.734
Never entered their
selfish minds.

44:28.734 --> 44:31.903
But you?

44:31.903 --> 44:36.708
Didn't even swear it.
You just did it.

44:36.708 --> 44:42.247
You killed them for me.

44:42.247 --> 44:45.050
- I did it 'cause
they deserved it.

44:45.050 --> 44:47.552
- That's what I mean.

45:00.498 --> 45:02.533

45:07.205 --> 45:11.176
- We're not doing anything.

45:11.176 --> 45:15.080
Is that okay?

45:15.080 --> 45:17.215
- Yeah.

45:21.953 --> 45:24.322
It's okay.

45:58.990 --> 46:01.426
- The prison is ours.
We will defend it.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.928
- Oh my god!

46:02.928 --> 46:05.363
- Do you have any
idea what they want?

46:05.363 --> 46:06.932
- Payback.

46:06.932 --> 46:11.870
- *

46:11.870 --> 46:13.471
- You know how this ends.

46:13.471 --> 46:17.042
- [prisoners shouting]

46:17.042 --> 46:19.344
- P-DOG: They made a
promise to us, Mike.

46:19.344 --> 46:20.879
It's time the world knew.

46:20.879 --> 46:23.781
It's time somebody
sent a message.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.383
And the message is me.

46:30.721 --> 46:36.928
- *
