WEBVTT

00:01.694 --> 00:03.453
Sorry.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.180
- Des!
- What?

00:05.215 --> 00:06.982
Oh, shit.

00:07.017 --> 00:10.285
Detective Arlene Branch.
Nice to meet you.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.486
Are you all packed for your trip?

00:11.522 --> 00:12.754
I won't be needing you

00:12.790 --> 00:14.489
to drive me to my performance piece

00:14.525 --> 00:16.190
because I-I'm gonna go with
my girlfriend, Virginia.

00:16.226 --> 00:17.526
You told Dean

00:17.561 --> 00:18.660
you would go with him to South Beach?

00:18.695 --> 00:20.062
I love South Beach.

00:20.097 --> 00:22.531
He thinks you're his girlfriend,
dumb-dumb.

00:22.566 --> 00:24.433
Bryce, you have proven yourself.

00:24.468 --> 00:28.437
Not only as a Husser,
but as a businessman.

00:28.472 --> 00:31.073
Last week was the best
the clinic's ever had.

00:31.108 --> 00:32.908
We set the Coombses up to be killed.

00:32.943 --> 00:34.876
And now Jenn has to live with the fact

00:34.912 --> 00:37.679
that her husband is a murderer.

00:37.714 --> 00:40.715
He killed those two people
because of you.

00:40.751 --> 00:42.717
I'm not gonna let
all this Uncle Daddy shit

00:42.753 --> 00:44.753
get in the way of us.

00:44.788 --> 00:46.555
And, hey, you have to talk to me

00:46.590 --> 00:47.856
if you have something you want to.

00:47.891 --> 00:49.658
Roller's alive!
He's here at South Beach.

00:49.693 --> 00:52.027
What are you smoking?
Put Dean on the damn phone.

00:52.062 --> 00:53.295
Hey, look, it's Roller, Virginia!

00:53.330 --> 00:55.063
Hey, Roller! It's Dean!

00:56.733 --> 00:58.133
I don't believe this.

00:58.168 --> 00:59.935
My husband...

00:59.970 --> 01:02.104
buffed and polished a certain couple

01:02.139 --> 01:03.405
and Roller is alive?

01:03.440 --> 01:06.007
That is 100% on me,

01:06.043 --> 01:07.843
and I am so, so sorry.

01:07.878 --> 01:10.145
Well, your bein' sorry
ain't gonna change anything.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.447
I-I-I know! I messed up.

01:12.483 --> 01:14.616
Yeah, and it just keeps gettin' messier!

01:14.651 --> 01:16.485
Ooh, I could just kill you right now.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.586
I know.

01:17.621 --> 01:18.820
Are y'all sure it was him?

01:18.856 --> 01:20.922
It's him, girl. He looked right at me.

01:20.958 --> 01:21.857
Right, Dean?

01:21.892 --> 01:23.592
Y-Yeah. It was Roller, yeah.

01:23.627 --> 01:25.360
But he didn't say "hello"
in South Beach.

01:25.395 --> 01:26.628
Very bad manners.

01:26.663 --> 01:29.998
What is he...
the Bionic Man or something?

01:31.235 --> 01:33.835
Well, what was he doing
at Art South Beach?

01:33.871 --> 01:36.338
That boy doesn't know
a Kandinsky from a Kehinde.

01:36.373 --> 01:37.873
Bitch, stop showin' off.

01:37.908 --> 01:40.442
Well, it could be
some type of reincarnation.

01:40.477 --> 01:43.245
O-Or transmigration, like a rebirth.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.014
Body Builder Week already, huh?

01:46.049 --> 01:47.883
Yeah.

01:47.918 --> 01:49.417
Hey, Hank, yeah.

01:49.453 --> 01:52.787
Lido Beach is crawlin' with 'em.
What're you doing here?

01:52.823 --> 01:54.504

Go with Hank to get some coffee.

02:11.108 --> 02:13.742
Oh, okay, uh...
but I-I don't want any coffee.

02:13.777 --> 02:15.477
Okay, well, go get it anyway.

02:15.512 --> 02:17.619

02:21.451 --> 02:23.385
Oh, thanks.

02:23.420 --> 02:24.586
How'd he end up in South Beach?

02:24.621 --> 02:25.987
Maybe he's got a side piece there.

02:26.023 --> 02:28.490
Mm. Maybe he wanted to start a new life.

02:28.525 --> 02:29.633

We all thought you died.

03:53.143 --> 03:56.444
We did. W... Everybody was so upset.

03:57.346 --> 03:59.547
Yeah, well...

03:59.583 --> 04:01.916
I don't remember nothin'.

04:01.952 --> 04:04.152
You don't?

04:04.519 --> 04:05.787
No.

04:05.822 --> 04:07.656
Somebody put a slug through my chest,

04:07.691 --> 04:09.357
but I don't even know how it went down.

04:09.393 --> 04:10.659
Where you been?

04:10.694 --> 04:13.495
Some crazy woman saved me.

04:13.530 --> 04:16.298
I swear, she patched me up all together

04:16.333 --> 04:19.701
and nursed me,
and, pretty much, I'm here now.

04:19.736 --> 04:21.002
That's where you were the whole time,

04:21.038 --> 04:22.370
and you didn't call or nothin'?

04:23.080 --> 04:25.006
Yeah, but I don't want
to talk about that.

04:25.457 --> 04:27.208
Have you talked to Uncle Daddy?

04:27.244 --> 04:28.410
No.

04:28.445 --> 04:30.178
I came straight to you, baby.

04:30.213 --> 04:32.130
Okay. Well, um...

04:33.298 --> 04:34.516
I could take you over there.

04:34.551 --> 04:35.884
I mean, you know,

04:35.919 --> 04:38.486
I-I'm sure him and Juanda
want to see you.

04:38.986 --> 04:40.822
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

04:40.857 --> 04:42.257
I'll come with you. Yeah, me too.

04:42.292 --> 04:43.925
Mm-hmm. I'm family.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.928
Yeah, I-I'll stay here with
Dean. I'll watch over the shop.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.967
I mean, you know,
we open up two more clinics

04:53.003 --> 04:55.070
by the end of the year,
the... the traffic

04:55.105 --> 04:58.673
on the oxy highway
gonna be way the hell up.

04:58.709 --> 04:59.941
You still got your eye

04:59.976 --> 05:03.044
on that old fire station over yonder?

05:03.080 --> 05:05.814
Hell yeah. I mean, it's perfect.

05:05.849 --> 05:08.483
You know, right by the...
the major highways.

05:08.518 --> 05:11.853
I have the Realtor puttin'
numbers together right now

05:11.888 --> 05:14.255

05:14.291 --> 05:15.757
Boys!

05:15.792 --> 05:18.760
We 'bout to be kingpin
right up here of this bitch.

05:21.631 --> 05:23.198
I'll drink to that.

06:08.044 --> 06:10.945
Sweet Lazarus!

06:10.981 --> 06:13.515
What in the hell is goin' on?

06:29.800 --> 06:32.267
Oh, yeah!

06:32.302 --> 06:34.205
Okay, okay!

06:34.240 --> 06:36.771
Oh, it's a miracle!
I can't believe it, man!

06:36.807 --> 06:40.708
Oh, my God! It's a miracle!
It's a miracle!

06:40.744 --> 06:42.911
Take it easy.

06:42.946 --> 06:44.946
How you been? How're my nieces?

06:44.981 --> 06:46.381
- Oh, e-everyone's fine.
- Huh? Huh?

06:46.416 --> 06:47.849
How are you?

06:47.884 --> 06:49.250
He c-can't remember anythin'
about the shooting,

06:49.286 --> 06:50.919
so we're just tryin'
to figure it out, here.

06:50.954 --> 06:52.120
N-Nothin' at all?

06:52.155 --> 06:53.655
No, I guess some... some woman

06:53.690 --> 06:55.423
brought him back to life or some shit.

06:55.459 --> 06:57.225
But you remember who you are
and who we are

06:57.260 --> 06:58.793
and where you live and everything.

06:58.829 --> 07:00.328
You just can't remember about that day?

07:00.363 --> 07:01.463
Yeah, pretty much.

07:01.498 --> 07:02.831
Traumatic memory loss.

07:02.866 --> 07:05.733
It's a situation-specific
amnesia, like PTSD.

07:05.769 --> 07:08.470
He just can't
recall the incident itself.

07:08.505 --> 07:09.971
W-Will he get his memory back?

07:10.006 --> 07:11.706
Maybe, maybe not.

07:11.741 --> 07:13.174
Other than that, he's banged up,

07:13.210 --> 07:14.209
severely dehydrated.

07:14.244 --> 07:15.176
He'll heal.

07:15.212 --> 07:16.778
Roller, I got something for the pain.

07:16.813 --> 07:18.079
Yep. All right.

07:18.114 --> 07:20.181
So, side effects include
constipation, nausea,

07:20.217 --> 07:21.983
- erectile...
- All right, all right. We got it.

07:22.018 --> 07:23.218
Get back to the clinic, will you?

07:23.253 --> 07:24.819
Copy that.

07:25.222 --> 07:26.454
Jesus.

07:26.490 --> 07:28.223
My baby boy...

07:28.258 --> 07:30.225
My baby boy, I'm so glad you're back.

07:30.260 --> 07:32.327
Your Auntie Mama, she's on her way back

07:32.362 --> 07:34.128
from a girls' weekend
in Key Biscayne, okay?

07:34.164 --> 07:35.864
But she been... she been heartbroken.

07:35.899 --> 07:37.932
She been praying
on her rosary beads every night.

07:37.968 --> 07:39.100
Hey. All right.

07:39.135 --> 07:40.568
Can't wait to see her.

07:40.604 --> 07:42.003
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

07:42.038 --> 07:44.205
I'm gonna spend some time
with my baby girl first.

07:44.241 --> 07:46.140
We got to talk about some things.

07:46.176 --> 07:48.409
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah!

07:48.445 --> 07:49.619
Um...

07:50.547 --> 07:53.915
you want to get some shrimp,
like old times?

07:53.950 --> 07:55.984
Are you sure he's up for that?

07:56.019 --> 07:58.186
Yeah, maybe he needs
to catch up on some rest.

07:58.221 --> 08:00.290
- He probably does.
- Oh, no, I'm good.

08:00.325 --> 08:02.023
I'd rather spend some time witchu, baby.

08:02.058 --> 08:03.525
Yeah, he is. He's a Husser.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.793
Y'all know how I like
to throw parties, right?

08:05.829 --> 08:07.595
Well, I'ma throw another one tomorrow

08:07.631 --> 08:10.298
in honor of my baby boy
coming back to life.

08:10.333 --> 08:11.366
Whoo!

08:11.401 --> 08:12.967
Maybe bein' around friends and family

08:13.003 --> 08:15.103
gonna jog that memory
a little bit, all right?

08:15.138 --> 08:17.572
So, y'all invited! Wear white.
Rise on up!

08:17.607 --> 08:19.240
Bring it up from the dead,
from the ashes!

08:19.276 --> 08:21.009
He gonna get that. Gonna get that.

08:21.044 --> 08:22.443
Get it! Get it good!

08:22.479 --> 08:24.946
Oh, Lord. Love it up!
You deserve it, baby boy.

08:24.981 --> 08:26.681
It's all about love right now.

08:26.716 --> 08:27.916
Bring it up! Get it!

08:27.951 --> 08:29.361
Get on in there!

08:29.386 --> 08:31.165
I'm com... I'm comin'get you!

08:36.541 --> 08:39.174

08:39.210 --> 08:40.794
Mmm.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.745
You got it. No, you got it.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.148
- You got it. No, go ahead.
- One more.

08:45.183 --> 08:48.117
- Hey.
- Mmm.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.352
Mmm.

08:53.911 --> 08:54.991
Hey, D, let me ask you something.

08:55.026 --> 08:57.360
Hmm?

08:57.395 --> 08:59.429
Were you really sad when, uh...

08:59.464 --> 09:01.397
when you thought I was dead?

09:06.137 --> 09:07.804
For real?

09:07.839 --> 09:10.406
Yeah, for real for real.

09:10.442 --> 09:12.341
Why you... Why you sweatin' me?

09:12.377 --> 09:14.777
I'm not sweatin' you.

09:14.813 --> 09:16.846
I'm just, um...

09:16.881 --> 09:19.282
It just matters to me. That's all.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.719
D, I know I did you dirty
when we were together.

09:24.789 --> 09:27.423
What?

09:27.459 --> 09:31.661
You just... seem different.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.563
Mm.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.365
I didn't tell you this earlier, but...

09:37.268 --> 09:38.735
that woman who helped me recover,

09:38.770 --> 09:40.670
she also held me captive.

09:40.705 --> 09:45.742
She was, like, this...
swamp-barking looney-tooney.

09:45.777 --> 09:48.010
She... messed me up.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.046
Wait. Captive?

09:50.081 --> 09:51.491
Oh, yeah.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.161
Taught me a few things, too.

09:56.921 --> 10:00.375
Women can do some
crazy-dark shit when they want.

10:04.996 --> 10:07.697
Let's go back to your place, huh?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.633
You don't want to go to my place.

10:10.668 --> 10:13.970
You always said you...
you hated my place.

10:16.099 --> 10:18.643
I don't want to go back to mine...

10:19.377 --> 10:21.210
and you're drivin' me crazy, baby.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.153
Do, um...

10:29.254 --> 10:33.491
Do you remember the last time
I threaded your eyebrows?

10:39.564 --> 10:41.097
No.

10:41.132 --> 10:44.400
I remember doin' reps out on my deck,

10:44.435 --> 10:47.046
lookin' out onto the ocean, but...

10:48.173 --> 10:50.173
Yeah.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.008
It just goes black.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.349
Oh, shit.

10:57.385 --> 10:59.182
- What?
- Des is takin' Roller to her house.

10:59.217 --> 11:00.883
Has she lost her damn mind?!

11:00.919 --> 11:03.953
Mochachina's right.
That's not a smart move.

11:03.988 --> 11:06.956
What if he's trying to get her
alone so he can kill her?

11:06.991 --> 11:09.625
Oh, my God. Then he's gonna come for me.

11:09.661 --> 11:11.093
Does it always have to be about you?

11:11.129 --> 11:12.995
Uh, yes, girl. I'm a millennial.

11:13.031 --> 11:14.897
- I don't like it.
- I don't either, Ann.

11:14.933 --> 11:17.075
I know Des and I are
having a moment right now,

11:17.135 --> 11:18.567
and I disagree with how she's handled

11:18.603 --> 11:20.764
just about everything,
but y'all know I love her,

11:20.800 --> 11:22.152
and I don't want anythin'
to happen to her.

11:22.187 --> 11:24.173
No, no, no, no.
D-Dean took the bus home.

11:24.208 --> 11:26.509
Roller's not gonna do anything
to Desna while...

11:26.544 --> 11:28.477
- while Dean's there, trust me.
- Oh, oh, okay.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.179
Okay. All right. That's good.

11:30.214 --> 11:31.747
- She's gonna be okay.
- She's gonna... All right.

11:31.783 --> 11:32.848
She'll be at work tomorrow.

11:32.884 --> 11:34.650
She better be.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.811
You look beautiful.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.422
I forget how fine you are, D.

12:26.604 --> 12:28.170
How's that feel?

12:28.206 --> 12:29.839
That feels okay.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.207
Yeah?

12:31.242 --> 12:33.175
Better than okay.

12:34.679 --> 12:37.480
I want you to do something for me, baby.

12:37.515 --> 12:40.049
All right?

12:40.084 --> 12:41.984
What're you doin'?

12:42.019 --> 12:44.019
I thought this is what you wanted.

12:44.581 --> 12:47.000
No, I don't want that anymore.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.560
Mm. I want you on top.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.696
Yeah.

12:57.769 --> 12:59.735
Come here.

13:03.107 --> 13:06.108
It feels so good.

13:08.946 --> 13:10.479
Feel that?

13:10.515 --> 13:12.214
What is that?

13:14.018 --> 13:15.918
That's where they shot me.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.498
You're everything, D.

13:28.199 --> 13:29.751
You heard me?

13:31.302 --> 13:32.802
You're everything.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.965
Boo!

14:06.516 --> 14:08.315
How come you're not dead?

14:08.351 --> 14:10.184
I got lucky, I guess.

14:10.219 --> 14:13.254
There was strippers at your funeral.

14:13.289 --> 14:14.225
Baylor!

14:14.250 --> 14:16.490
Well, I guess Uncle Daddy
did it right, then, huh?

14:16.526 --> 14:19.860
- More buckwheat pancakes anyone?
- Oh, God, no. I can't.

14:19.896 --> 14:21.295
They were delicious, Dean.

14:21.330 --> 14:23.264
Hey.

14:23.299 --> 14:26.200
Wow, what is all this? Hey, Desna.

14:26.235 --> 14:29.103
Dean is, uh, making a "welcome
back" breakfast for Roller.

14:29.138 --> 14:30.538
Yeah, I just invited everybody over.

14:30.573 --> 14:32.106
I thought it'd be good
for us to just all

14:32.141 --> 14:34.475
be together and alive.

14:37.146 --> 14:39.747
Oh, my God.

14:41.084 --> 14:42.316
Um...

14:42.351 --> 14:45.086
Well, I hope that
means you're happy to see me.

14:45.121 --> 14:47.421
I brought some pastries.

14:47.457 --> 14:50.257
You know, now is not a good ti...

14:50.293 --> 14:52.860
Mnh, mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh.
I didn't brush my teeth yet.

14:52.895 --> 14:55.963
Ah, I don't care.

14:55.998 --> 14:58.047
I've been thinking about you.

14:58.768 --> 15:00.601
You know what? Um... come on.

15:00.636 --> 15:03.104
I'm right in the middle
of a family thing in there,

15:03.139 --> 15:06.407
so can I... can I call you
a little later?

15:06.442 --> 15:07.475
Call me?

15:07.510 --> 15:08.808
Yeah.

15:18.488 --> 15:21.789
Uh, Roller, th-this is
Dr. Gregory Ruval.

15:21.824 --> 15:22.790
- What's happenin', man?
- How do you do?

15:22.825 --> 15:23.991
All right.

15:26.362 --> 15:27.962
Your backpack better be in the car.

15:27.997 --> 15:29.597
- Going to school.
- Oh.

15:29.632 --> 15:31.866
- Going to school.
- Hey, Dr. Ruval.

15:31.901 --> 15:33.767
- Uh, this is my husband, Bryce.
- Oh, hi.

15:33.803 --> 15:35.369
Nice to meet you. Hey, shake his hand.

15:35.404 --> 15:37.171
Come on. High-five it, high-five
it. Come on, give it up on top.

15:37.206 --> 15:38.472
Hey!

15:38.508 --> 15:41.308
Damn, that was quick.
You boo-ed up already, huh?

15:41.344 --> 15:42.877
Nice to meet you.

15:42.912 --> 15:45.379
I'ma go to the clinic with Bryce.

15:45.414 --> 15:49.083
Uh... tell Dean I said
"thank you" for breakfast.

15:49.952 --> 15:51.719
Come on! Everybody in the car.

15:51.754 --> 15:53.120
- There we go.
- Come on.

15:53.156 --> 15:54.655
See ya later, girl!

16:04.133 --> 16:05.366
So...

16:05.401 --> 16:06.901
who was that?

16:06.936 --> 16:09.003
No one.

16:09.038 --> 16:11.672
- Desna...
- What?

16:12.872 --> 16:14.475
That was Jenn's brother-in-law.

16:14.510 --> 16:18.145
We used to deal with each other,
but not anymore.

16:18.181 --> 16:21.015
But... he was here, at your house.

16:21.050 --> 16:23.217
Because he's staying
with Bryce and Jenn,

16:23.252 --> 16:24.718
and they came over.

16:24.754 --> 16:26.177
But him and me...

16:26.923 --> 16:28.756
we're done.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.025
Cross my heart.

16:31.060 --> 16:34.094
You know what? You're a piece of work.

16:34.130 --> 16:36.330
But you're lucky I'm so into you.

16:36.365 --> 16:38.399
So, we good?

16:38.434 --> 16:39.633
Of course.

16:39.669 --> 16:41.109
Yeah?

16:49.832 --> 16:51.500
How does a guy get shot,

16:51.535 --> 16:53.502
lit on fire, pushed out to sea,

16:53.537 --> 16:55.404
and still survive?

16:55.439 --> 16:58.473
Swear to God, rednecks have nine lives.

17:10.087 --> 17:12.654
Hey, uh, how's it going
with the new system?

17:12.689 --> 17:14.122
I hate to give you props,

17:14.157 --> 17:16.290
since you tried to execute me
and everything,

17:16.326 --> 17:17.858
but this...

17:17.895 --> 17:19.594
this digital cataloguing
you came up with,

17:19.630 --> 17:21.029
it's pretty dope.

17:21.064 --> 17:24.465
I'm just trying to become
my authentic best, Ken.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.402
Living a life that builds a legacy.

17:27.438 --> 17:28.770
Yeah, whatever.

17:28.806 --> 17:31.306
All I know is, when I click this tab...

17:32.643 --> 17:34.910
Huzzah!... patient records!

17:34.945 --> 17:37.012
That's porn, Ken.

17:37.498 --> 17:39.681
Oh, shit. Wrong tab.

17:54.749 --> 17:57.599
What you doin'?

17:57.634 --> 18:01.336
Finna check the inventory,
call one of my suppliers.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.038
Bryce called and said

18:03.073 --> 18:05.474
you were chompin' at the bit.

18:05.943 --> 18:07.543
What you need is to rest.

18:07.579 --> 18:08.944
It's too early for you to be back.

18:08.979 --> 18:10.445
Come on, now.

18:10.481 --> 18:12.093
Let me take you home,
get you to recuperate.

18:12.128 --> 18:14.382
What I need to do is
get my ass back to work.

18:14.418 --> 18:15.684
Get these scripts comin' in.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.719
Ah. Got that covered.

18:17.754 --> 18:20.889
MRI truck has increased
our daily prescription volume

18:20.924 --> 18:22.190
by 20%.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.525
Whoo.

18:23.560 --> 18:27.590
Well. Well, you done came up, huh, son?

18:34.404 --> 18:35.437
We'll be okay. Yeah?

18:35.472 --> 18:37.672
Yeah. Good, good.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.075
I want that boy to enjoy himself
at the party.

18:40.110 --> 18:43.678
Shit, I spent enough money on it.

18:43.714 --> 18:45.514
Well, hey,
let's go make some more money.

18:45.549 --> 18:46.948
Let's make some more money.

18:46.984 --> 18:48.617
Let's do it!

19:09.573 --> 19:12.474
Deejay, deejay, let me get that mic.

19:12.509 --> 19:13.886
Thank you.

19:15.078 --> 19:17.078
All right, thank y'all for comin'.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.648
Appreciate it.
Hope you're having a good time.

19:20.101 --> 19:23.521
In Luke 18:27,

19:24.187 --> 19:26.054
Jesus tells us that,

19:26.607 --> 19:31.960
"What is impossible with man
is possible with God."

19:31.995 --> 19:35.764
And the fact that my baby boy
is alive and here with us today

19:35.799 --> 19:39.301
is a testament to just that.

19:41.455 --> 19:43.572
I want to thank Our Father

19:43.607 --> 19:46.174
for holding Roller in His heavenly hand

19:46.209 --> 19:49.411
and guiding him back here to Palmetto.

19:49.446 --> 19:50.712
Yes, sir.

19:50.747 --> 19:54.983
Please help us welcome him home!

19:55.018 --> 19:56.585
Ha ha!

19:56.620 --> 19:57.886
Thank you.

20:03.627 --> 20:05.160
Yeah!

20:07.064 --> 20:08.363
Whoo-hoo!

20:08.398 --> 20:09.631
Whoo! Enjoy yourself!

20:14.571 --> 20:16.771
Hey, baby.

20:16.807 --> 20:19.774
You doing okay?
You seem a little agitated.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.376
No, I'm fine, baby.

20:21.411 --> 20:23.912
It just, the way you kept
lookin' at your phone...

20:23.947 --> 20:26.114
I'm good, baby. I'm good.

20:26.149 --> 20:28.850
Remember the last time
we danced together, hmm?

20:29.872 --> 20:33.188
Yeah, it was, uh...
New Year's Eve at She She's.

20:33.223 --> 20:34.923
Listen, D, I know me and Virginia

20:34.958 --> 20:37.219
were messing around, but, uh...

20:37.694 --> 20:39.561
on God, it was nothin'.

20:39.596 --> 20:41.129
Roller...

20:41.164 --> 20:44.232
Real talk, D. I want you.

20:44.267 --> 20:48.169
I know you and that fool got
a little thing goin' on, but...

20:48.205 --> 20:50.024
you gimme one more chance...

20:50.874 --> 20:53.341
we'll be good together.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.437
Yeah?

20:57.014 --> 20:59.014
Hmm?

21:06.556 --> 21:08.390
Hey, Roller! Hey!

21:08.425 --> 21:10.025
- Boom!
- Hey.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.093
My man. My man!

21:12.129 --> 21:14.362
Look at you, lookin' all big swole.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.197
I-I've been training, Roller, yeah.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.833
I-I-I like to be strong
for my sister and my girlfriend.

21:18.869 --> 21:21.002
Oh, you got a little honey-bunny now?

21:21.038 --> 21:23.036
I-I-If that means girlfriend, yeah.

21:23.071 --> 21:25.540
Yeah, Virginia's my girlfriend.
We had sex.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.609
- You what?!
- Hey.

21:27.644 --> 21:29.536
Yeah, and... and...
and she had an orgasm.

21:29.571 --> 21:31.628
She said she never had one
before. With anyone.

21:31.663 --> 21:34.416
Wait. What?

21:34.451 --> 21:36.584
Dean...

21:36.620 --> 21:39.554
An orgasm is a release, Des.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.256
I-I-In order to give a woman one,

21:41.291 --> 21:42.891
it helps to focus on the clitoris.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.893
- Oh, my God.
- I know what it is, Dean.

21:46.315 --> 21:48.596
Hey, you be careful with this one here.

21:48.632 --> 21:50.165
She's not as innocent as she looks.

21:54.671 --> 21:57.138
What you doin' sittin' at a bar?

21:57.174 --> 21:59.874
I mean, isn't this
the danger zone for y'all?

21:59.910 --> 22:02.310
Well, it's a Uncle Daddy party.
Everywhere's a danger zone.

22:02.345 --> 22:04.479
This is true.

22:04.514 --> 22:06.885
Listen... somebody is texting Roller...

22:06.953 --> 22:08.736
...about him owing them some money...

22:08.771 --> 22:10.452
...and it seem shady as hell.

22:10.487 --> 22:12.654
- Think it's an ex-girl?
- No. Mnh-mnh.

22:12.689 --> 22:14.856
- You don't see the screen?
- Hey, Roller.

22:14.891 --> 22:17.192
What's up, baby?

22:17.227 --> 22:19.461
Hey, baby boy. Hey.

22:19.496 --> 22:21.996
I don't know about all that
crazy business earlier...

22:22.032 --> 22:24.833
...but I definitely want in
back in the clinic.

22:24.868 --> 22:26.367
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:26.403 --> 22:28.970
Hey.

22:29.005 --> 22:31.372
What if you took over the MRI truck?

22:31.408 --> 22:33.708
Pass.

22:33.744 --> 22:36.635
You know, the truth is...
is... is Uncle Daddy wants me

22:36.670 --> 22:39.748
to continue running the clinic. Solo.

22:39.783 --> 22:42.217
This is bullshit!

22:42.252 --> 22:43.585
Got a crackhead here that thinks

22:43.620 --> 22:45.667
- he's more reliable than me.
- Hey.

22:45.702 --> 22:48.056
Don't I always get shit done
for Uncle Daddy?

22:48.091 --> 22:49.891
- Huh?
- Apparently not.

22:49.926 --> 22:51.693
Roller, it's okay.

22:51.728 --> 22:54.857
Listen, boy, you ain't
got the stomach for this shit.

22:57.868 --> 23:00.780
You have no idea what I have
the stomach for.

23:00.805 --> 23:01.933
Mm-hmm.

23:01.968 --> 23:03.605
I took out those dealers who shot you.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.106
- The Coombses... I killed them for you.
- Come on, now.

23:05.142 --> 23:06.641
- This is a party.
- I killed them for you.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.309
- Okay. Can we not make a fuss?
- Stop. Stop.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.578
- Come on.
- Things have changed, little brother.

23:10.614 --> 23:13.665
- See, the crackhead's in charge now...
- Come on.

23:13.701 --> 23:15.150
...so what you might want to do
is get used to it.

23:15.351 --> 23:17.228
- Yeah, all right, there, crack star.
- Come on, come on.

23:17.253 --> 23:19.453
Hey, monkeys don't sling bananas.

23:20.352 --> 23:22.203
Can you believe him? Hmm?

23:22.238 --> 23:23.955
Like he's the only one
that can run the clinic.

23:23.990 --> 23:26.457
I know.

23:26.493 --> 23:28.193
But you can't blame the man
for wanting his job back.

23:32.165 --> 23:34.103
You know we're trying to recommit
to our sobriety, so...

23:35.677 --> 23:37.588
...I don't really feel
like we can do that

23:37.624 --> 23:39.276
- with you workin' at the clinic.
- ♪ They were noble and wise

23:39.311 --> 23:41.463
Jenn, give me a break.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.346
Hey, you know what?

23:48.381 --> 23:50.548
I think I got something
that'll make this better.

23:52.819 --> 23:55.220
Huh? Hmm-hmm-hmm.

23:57.906 --> 23:59.372
What is that?

23:59.407 --> 24:01.374
I upgraded.

24:02.611 --> 24:04.277
And you thought that was gonna help?

24:04.312 --> 24:05.545
How?

24:06.553 --> 24:07.714
Well, I'm...

24:07.749 --> 24:11.026
y-y-you're focused
on the negative of my job...

24:11.053 --> 24:12.519
the fact I slipped once.

24:12.555 --> 24:15.798
This... This can help you focus
on the positive.

24:15.798 --> 24:18.932
You know, what the clinic can do for us.

24:18.967 --> 24:20.167
For our family.

24:20.609 --> 24:23.112
Nah, you just don't get it, babe.

24:24.907 --> 24:27.407
That clinic's gonna be
what destroys it all.

24:29.945 --> 24:33.079
16... 17...

24:33.115 --> 24:36.149
Yeah, Dean!... 18...

24:36.185 --> 24:37.818
19...

24:37.853 --> 24:39.937
20! What?!

24:39.973 --> 24:41.154
21!

24:43.992 --> 24:46.293
Looks like Roller and Desna
didn't miss a beat.

24:46.328 --> 24:50.230
Yeah, well, he has a thing for her.

24:53.869 --> 24:56.436
Well, I know a lot about
what people want...

24:56.471 --> 24:59.345
...even if they never say it.

25:03.178 --> 25:05.045
Okay. What do I want?

25:05.080 --> 25:07.851
Your nipples squeezed...

25:07.886 --> 25:09.950
...while I ride you like a pogo stick.

25:17.192 --> 25:19.392
Vini...

25:19.428 --> 25:21.461
...Vidi... Vici!

25:21.496 --> 25:24.030
Yes, you little doctor!

25:25.834 --> 25:28.368
You play doctor with me!

25:28.403 --> 25:30.203
Dr. - Oh! Wait!

25:30.239 --> 25:32.372
Ohhhhh!

25:36.712 --> 25:38.044
Listen, man, I tried.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.247
There's no cash. There's no stash.

25:40.282 --> 25:42.349
We don't care. You're late.

25:42.384 --> 25:45.151
I don't work at the clinic anymore.

25:46.855 --> 25:49.422
Fine.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.825
You give us one last lump sum...

25:51.860 --> 25:53.693
150k.

25:53.729 --> 25:55.195
Then we finished.

25:57.666 --> 25:58.899
Give me a week.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.134
You got 24 hours.

26:01.169 --> 26:04.037
How do you expect me to get
that kind of money in 24 hours?

26:04.072 --> 26:06.172
Hmm?

26:29.498 --> 26:32.465
What's up, baby? Let's have a dance.

26:32.501 --> 26:34.067
Come on.

26:34.102 --> 26:35.802
My feet hurt, Roller!

26:35.837 --> 26:38.805
You know, I stopped by the crib
a little earlier, and, uh...

26:38.840 --> 26:42.075
...seems like
all my funds were depleted.

26:42.110 --> 26:44.077
You know what happened to that stash?

26:44.112 --> 26:46.446
The cops said the Coombses stole it.

26:46.481 --> 26:48.181
They... They found it in their place.

26:48.216 --> 26:50.350
Everybody keeps talkin'
about these Coombses.

26:50.385 --> 26:53.925
Combsey, Combsey... I don't know.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.222
That bit seems a little hazy for me.

26:57.772 --> 26:59.793
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Give me a chair!

26:59.828 --> 27:02.329
- Hurry up!
- Come on! Come on!

27:02.364 --> 27:04.297
Sit here.

27:04.333 --> 27:06.381
- Hey, hey!
- You okay?

27:06.416 --> 27:07.801
All right, hey, hey!
What's going on here?!

27:07.836 --> 27:08.835
Hey!

27:14.076 --> 27:16.810
Come on, now.
Give... Give him some space.

27:19.448 --> 27:22.949
I-It just, uh... It came to me...

27:22.985 --> 27:24.884
who shot me.

27:25.544 --> 27:28.054
I-I-It wasn't the Coombses.

27:28.090 --> 27:30.557
Oh, Jesus. Toby, my pills!

27:31.258 --> 27:32.859
The hell you talkin' about?

27:32.928 --> 27:36.162
The two people who broke into my house.

27:40.100 --> 27:43.703
One of them tried to strangle me
and then drown me in the pool.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.338
When that didn't work,

27:45.374 --> 27:47.540
the other one shot me in the chest.

27:53.882 --> 27:55.382
Yep, that's right.

28:03.759 --> 28:05.501
It was the Russians.

28:06.661 --> 28:08.261
What?

28:08.296 --> 28:10.764
They wanted in on the pill business,

28:10.799 --> 28:13.133
and they thought it'd weaken us.

28:13.168 --> 28:15.635
So they put a hit out on me.

28:19.441 --> 28:22.742
Son, if you pointin' fingers,
you better be specific.

28:22.778 --> 28:25.111
Oh, it was the twins.

28:25.147 --> 28:27.714
You mean them ones with the tracksuits?

28:27.749 --> 28:30.717
Mm-hmm. That's right.

28:33.722 --> 28:36.222
Russians startin' some shit with us?

28:36.258 --> 28:37.657
This ain't good.

28:38.742 --> 28:41.094
Everyone leave!
This a private situation.

28:41.129 --> 28:42.495
All right, you heard the man!

28:42.531 --> 28:44.631
Get out of here! Party's over!

28:52.240 --> 28:54.974
He is psychotic.

28:55.010 --> 28:56.576
Messin' with us this whole time.

28:56.611 --> 28:59.245
We need to take that boy out, y'all.

28:59.281 --> 29:01.481
We got to figure out why
Roller is saying

29:01.516 --> 29:04.117
that those two Russian boys
tried to kill him.

29:04.152 --> 29:05.852
They got to have something on him.

29:05.887 --> 29:08.054
He's been gettin' texts about money.

29:08.090 --> 29:09.889
Maybe it's from them.

29:09.925 --> 29:11.458
You know, I'm pretty sure they run

29:11.493 --> 29:13.793
the 24-hour check-cashing on Canal.

29:13.829 --> 29:15.395
Mm. The Liberian one.

29:16.598 --> 29:18.932
Yes, Virginia, the Russian twins

29:18.967 --> 29:20.867
run the Liberian Check Cashing.

29:20.902 --> 29:22.702
Siberian Crown Check Cashing.

29:22.737 --> 29:23.937
Correct. Yeah.

29:23.972 --> 29:25.939
I went there
to cash social security checks

29:25.974 --> 29:28.508
that I... "liberated" from the seniors.

29:28.543 --> 29:30.243
I mean, for a while,
my picture was posted there.

29:30.278 --> 29:31.444
It's down now.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.245
Desna!

29:32.280 --> 29:34.080
Yes, baby, what is it?

29:34.116 --> 29:35.982
Something bad is gonna happen.

29:36.425 --> 29:38.218
Dean, everything is gonna be fine.

29:38.253 --> 29:39.652
No, no. I-I-I have a bad feeling.

29:39.688 --> 29:41.721
And you know how bad feelings
make me anxious,

29:41.756 --> 29:43.389
- and I don't like being anxious.
- We got to go.

29:43.425 --> 29:46.426
Because my... my palms get
sweaty, and I get gas.

29:46.461 --> 29:48.294
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- You're not listening!

29:48.330 --> 29:49.829
I said some... something bad, Des!

29:49.865 --> 29:52.599
Okay, Dean. Come on, baby.
Let's get you in the car.

29:53.568 --> 29:55.468
Come on, come on, come on.

29:55.504 --> 29:57.971
Let's get you in the car.
Get in the van with Virginia.

29:58.006 --> 29:59.205
Come on.

30:01.109 --> 30:02.609
He's startin' to spin out.

30:02.644 --> 30:04.444
I'ma need y'all to get us home,

30:04.479 --> 30:06.012
and then I'ma need y'all to do a run

30:06.047 --> 30:07.413
to the check-cashing place.

30:08.216 --> 30:10.150
- Got it.
- Sure.

30:12.699 --> 30:15.067
Yeah, understood. We'll be in touch.

30:15.103 --> 30:16.602
Georgia wants to talk it over.

30:16.637 --> 30:18.170
They'll get back to us in a few hours.

30:18.206 --> 30:20.372
Why are we waitin' on them for?

30:20.408 --> 30:23.209
We handle this, Husser-style,
like we always do.

30:23.244 --> 30:24.910
No, no, no, no, Georgia runs things

30:24.946 --> 30:26.412
below the Mason-Dixon Line.

30:26.447 --> 30:27.913
You don't cross them.

30:27.949 --> 30:30.979
You do, and it'll be your last time.

30:32.019 --> 30:33.352
Uncle Daddy...

30:33.387 --> 30:34.920
this was an attack on the family.

30:34.956 --> 30:36.288
Yeah, I know.

30:36.324 --> 30:38.153
No one said anything about abortin'.

30:38.893 --> 30:41.160
They could come back with a green light.

30:41.195 --> 30:44.530
Yeah, well, and if they do,
don't you worry.

30:47.735 --> 30:49.635
We'll be ready.

31:14.061 --> 31:16.562
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

31:20.468 --> 31:22.835
Why? You cops?

31:22.870 --> 31:25.037
We're not, but we could call them...

31:25.072 --> 31:26.605
on you.

31:26.641 --> 31:28.307
Here, let's see...

31:28.342 --> 31:30.409
your dye job needs a touch-up.

31:30.444 --> 31:32.678
I can hear the Minnesota dialect
in your vowels,

31:32.713 --> 31:34.547
and you don't seem like someone
who would ever work

31:34.582 --> 31:36.182
in a check-cashing establishment.

31:36.217 --> 31:38.184
Preach. Unless, of course,

31:38.219 --> 31:39.685
you need to be in the employ of someone

31:39.720 --> 31:42.888
who doesn't ask questions
and pays you under the table.

31:42.924 --> 31:44.757
Who are you running from, girl?

31:46.794 --> 31:47.927
What do you want?

31:50.298 --> 31:52.531
Yeah, Roller used to come in here.

31:52.567 --> 31:53.866
Go on.

31:53.901 --> 31:56.435
He'd come in the 7th
of every month and give me 30k.

31:56.470 --> 31:57.803
Mm-hmm.

31:57.839 --> 31:59.505
Thanks for the info.

32:11.085 --> 32:13.552
So far, everything seems legit.

32:13.588 --> 32:14.520
Yep.

32:14.555 --> 32:15.554
How's Dean doing?

32:15.590 --> 32:16.856
He's doing better.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.724
Just keep looking.

32:18.759 --> 32:22.394
I was looking...
looking for someone special.

32:22.430 --> 32:25.097
Thought I found her,
thought we found each other.

32:25.132 --> 32:27.566
- We had amazing sex...
- Hmm?

32:27.602 --> 32:29.317
...and then she blew me off.

32:29.352 --> 32:30.636
Not now, Ken.

32:30.671 --> 32:32.605
I called you three times last night.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.672
I know.

32:33.708 --> 32:36.041
Your recitation of "When Doves Cry"

32:36.077 --> 32:37.309
filled up my voicemail box.

32:37.345 --> 32:39.211
Look for anything that

32:39.247 --> 32:40.746
would've been before Roller got shot.

32:40.781 --> 32:43.449
Obviously, the invoices
would've stopped after.

32:43.484 --> 32:46.218
Look, if you're not interested,
just let me know.

32:46.254 --> 32:47.866
I-I can handle it...

32:48.456 --> 32:50.890
with vodka and antidepressants and...

32:50.925 --> 32:53.959
Dude... you're playin' yourself.

32:53.995 --> 32:55.261
Wait, wait, wait.

32:55.296 --> 32:58.497
I don't remember a
"TIGEL Pharmaceuticals."

33:02.169 --> 33:04.803
That's "legit" spelled backwards.

33:04.839 --> 33:06.138
This is Roller's ass.

33:06.173 --> 33:07.873
See if you can find
other invoices for them.

33:07.909 --> 33:09.141
If I'm right,

33:09.176 --> 33:11.510
he created a fake company on the books.

33:11.545 --> 33:13.646
- Okay.
- Here's more TIGEL.

33:13.681 --> 33:14.947
Ann, call the number.

33:14.982 --> 33:18.384
Hey, I found some, too.
Oh, they date back months.

33:23.324 --> 33:24.924
Number not in service.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.058
This is how he was paying them.

33:26.093 --> 33:27.626
He invoiced a fake supplier,

33:27.662 --> 33:29.895
but he was taking the money
from the clinic.

33:31.699 --> 33:32.869
What, Mom?

33:32.894 --> 33:34.300
What's this about you
being way into Molly?

33:34.335 --> 33:36.726
With your allergies,
you shouldn't be doing MDMA.

33:36.761 --> 33:38.337
No, Mom, I said Polly.

33:38.372 --> 33:40.439
Polly, Schmolly.

33:40.474 --> 33:42.174
Oh, my God, Mom. What are you doing?

33:42.209 --> 33:43.943
This is a ridiculous conversation...

33:47.624 --> 33:49.254
Okay.

33:49.279 --> 33:50.215
Stop it!

33:50.251 --> 33:52.251
Really? Dr. Ken?

33:52.286 --> 33:54.453
Shut up. Y'all...

33:54.488 --> 33:55.921
Y'all...

33:55.957 --> 33:57.156
it was so good.

33:58.759 --> 33:59.725
Okay. Enough.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.923
Okay. Yes.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.696
Why would Roller need to embezzle money

34:03.731 --> 34:04.997
from the clinic?

34:05.032 --> 34:06.999
Because of them Russians.

34:07.034 --> 34:09.301
Obviously, they got something on him.

34:09.337 --> 34:11.570
Okay. Well, you need
to go to Uncle Daddy with that,

34:11.605 --> 34:14.672
because he will punish that boy,
and you'll be safe.

34:14.708 --> 34:16.608
Pol, it's tricky.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.125
We gotta play this just right.

34:25.786 --> 34:28.187
Hey. Sorry I had to be at that
family meeting all night.

34:28.222 --> 34:29.755
Could've left.

34:29.790 --> 34:31.190
It's fine.

34:31.225 --> 34:32.658
We just gotta get home
and change clothes.

34:32.693 --> 34:33.826
Mm.

34:33.860 --> 34:35.860
Sitter get the kids
off to school all right?

34:35.896 --> 34:36.933
Yeah.

34:37.732 --> 34:38.935
Hey.

34:39.734 --> 34:41.699
If you want to talk
about the Coombses...

34:43.471 --> 34:46.271
No, I'm... I-I'm good.

34:48.708 --> 34:51.697
Bryce, look at me.

34:53.283 --> 34:54.847
How can you be good?

34:55.577 --> 34:58.150
You know they didn't have nothing
to do with Roller's attack.

35:00.488 --> 35:01.541
I know.

35:02.289 --> 35:03.889
It's unfortunate.

35:05.192 --> 35:09.528
I think I'll donate some money
in their name to a good charity.

35:11.232 --> 35:13.866
Oh, my God.
Would you listen to yourself?

35:13.901 --> 35:16.468
You never would've said
something like that before.

35:16.504 --> 35:18.771
You know you sound
just like Uncle Daddy.

35:20.474 --> 35:22.474
Babe, listen. Hey, hey.

35:22.510 --> 35:24.710
Des is about to open up Glint.

35:24.745 --> 35:26.745
I'm gonna make so much more money,

35:26.781 --> 35:29.648
so we don't need him or the clinic.

35:30.487 --> 35:32.906
I don't know if you've noticed or not,

35:33.387 --> 35:35.755
but I'm really good at the pill game.

35:35.790 --> 35:37.953
Yeah. I noticed!

35:38.359 --> 35:41.460
And you promised it was just
gonna be temporary.

35:43.297 --> 35:44.730
Hey...

35:44.755 --> 35:47.879
why don't you listen to yourself, hmm?

35:48.436 --> 35:50.340
You sound like a broken record.

35:51.405 --> 35:52.801
And I'll be honest...

35:54.308 --> 35:56.141
I'm tired of listening.

36:10.157 --> 36:11.690
Georgia don't want no war,

36:11.725 --> 36:14.293
and I'm inclined to agree with them.

36:14.328 --> 36:17.262
Altercation leads
to tension and the police.

36:17.298 --> 36:19.744
It's the wrong move
right before expansion.

36:20.515 --> 36:21.781
Bullshit!

36:21.969 --> 36:23.873
Hey, son!

36:25.232 --> 36:27.999
That the PTSD speaking?

36:28.109 --> 36:29.596
Let me help you out there.

36:29.631 --> 36:30.880
Give me some sugar.

36:32.839 --> 36:34.050
Here. Take your pick.

36:35.416 --> 36:38.417
So we're just gonna bend over?

36:38.452 --> 36:40.652
Hey, sometimes...

36:40.688 --> 36:43.455
...you have to eat some shit, all right?

36:43.491 --> 36:45.397
We'll get our revenge. Don't you worry.

36:45.433 --> 36:46.896
All in good time.

36:47.862 --> 36:50.996
Taking the Russians out ain't it.

36:51.031 --> 36:52.564
It's for the best.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.533
Last thing we need is the DEA
sniffing around

36:54.568 --> 36:55.934
with us moving all that high volume.

36:55.970 --> 36:58.237
There he is!

36:58.272 --> 37:00.696
Hey, Brycey, I don't know if you heard.

37:00.732 --> 37:03.542
We got to get our hands dirty
in our business.

37:05.096 --> 37:09.181
Oh. What, so...
I didn't get my hands dirty?

37:10.584 --> 37:13.252
You shot the wrong people, genius.

37:13.287 --> 37:15.654
What good are some dead Realtors, hmm?

37:27.968 --> 37:31.570
I'll kill you for real! Let go, bitch!

37:31.605 --> 37:34.173
All right, God damn it! That's enough!

37:34.208 --> 37:35.607
Get off! Get off!

37:35.643 --> 37:37.643
That's enough, I said! Get up!

37:37.678 --> 37:39.613
God damn it! Knock it off!

37:39.648 --> 37:41.117
God damn it!

37:42.283 --> 37:45.484
How many times I have to tell you, huh?

37:45.519 --> 37:47.753
Every critter's got his place
in the jungle.

37:47.788 --> 37:50.710
Now, you need to apply that
to yourself, son.

37:51.959 --> 37:53.792
You're the captain of the MRI truck.

37:53.827 --> 37:56.299
It's all you, but the pill clinic...

37:57.965 --> 37:59.598
that's Bryce.

38:31.430 --> 38:33.263
I miss you, gorgeous.

38:33.298 --> 38:36.266
I miss you, too.
I'm sorry I'm working so much.

38:36.301 --> 38:40.303
And FYI, I hate Chip...
so smug and condescending.

38:40.339 --> 38:42.072
You're stressed.

38:42.107 --> 38:43.974
You doing crossword puzzles?

38:44.009 --> 38:45.642
Yeah.

38:45.677 --> 38:48.311
Chip's also on the take
from Clay Husser,

38:48.347 --> 38:51.181
makes no effort to hide it...
bugs the hell outta me.

38:51.216 --> 38:54.317
Six-letter word for an alignment
of three celestial bodies?

38:54.353 --> 38:55.785
Oh, what the hell?

38:55.821 --> 38:57.485
Syzygy.

38:58.457 --> 39:01.491
S-Y-Z-Y-G-Y.

39:04.763 --> 39:06.196
You're right.

39:06.231 --> 39:08.131
Why are you so good at this?

39:08.166 --> 39:10.400
Because I's edu-ma-cated.

39:10.435 --> 39:13.136
You really are
the smartest person I know.

39:13.171 --> 39:16.506
Shit, maybe you could help me
solve this Realtor homicide.

39:16.541 --> 39:19.576
The theory around here
is that some rival dealers

39:19.611 --> 39:21.211
came in and killed them.

39:21.246 --> 39:23.647
And yet, they didn't take
the drugs or the cash?

39:23.682 --> 39:26.349
It all feels wrong,
and I think Chip is involved.

39:26.385 --> 39:28.752
He's got his hands all
in that pain clinic.

39:28.787 --> 39:30.687
Let it go, Arlene, okay?

39:30.722 --> 39:32.822
You don't want to be involved
in anything the Hussers

39:32.858 --> 39:35.058
are involved in, trust me.

39:35.093 --> 39:37.560
I'll call you later, okay?

39:37.596 --> 39:38.795
Love you.

39:38.830 --> 39:40.397
You too.

39:45.704 --> 39:46.937
I say you tell Roller...

39:46.972 --> 39:48.305
Yeah. ...what you know,

39:48.340 --> 39:50.006
and that way, you have the upper hand.

39:52.411 --> 39:53.677
I don't know.

39:53.712 --> 39:55.912
Do you think that, um,
your new boyfriend

39:55.948 --> 39:57.948
knew that Roller was stealing money?

39:58.588 --> 40:00.483
Desna Simms!

40:00.519 --> 40:03.019
You have the biggest mouth in the world!

40:03.055 --> 40:04.854
I like Dr. Ken

40:04.890 --> 40:06.189
with his crazy ass.

40:06.224 --> 40:07.757
Girl, you know the crazy ones know

40:07.793 --> 40:09.192
how to hit it... Boom.

40:09.227 --> 40:11.261
- See?
- Amen! Go for yours.

40:11.296 --> 40:13.296
Get your man.

40:13.332 --> 40:16.032
- Come on, now.
- Girl!

40:23.108 --> 40:24.708
Get out.

40:28.981 --> 40:30.780
We need to talk.

40:30.816 --> 40:34.184
I just got word your crew

40:34.219 --> 40:37.454
been interfering
with my check-cashing business.

40:38.423 --> 40:40.857
Give me reason not to kill you.

40:40.892 --> 40:42.759
Shit.

40:47.666 --> 40:49.332
I like.

40:49.368 --> 40:50.900
What color this is?

40:50.936 --> 40:52.102
Um...

40:52.558 --> 40:53.870
it's Teatro.

40:53.905 --> 40:58.308
I didn't know
that was your business, Riva.

41:01.109 --> 41:02.445
Well, now you do.

41:06.284 --> 41:09.919
I was just trying
to see what Roller was up to.

41:14.559 --> 41:18.061
He said it was your people
that tried to kill him.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.898
He say we try to assassinate him?

41:21.933 --> 41:24.000
He did. He sure did.

41:24.036 --> 41:26.936
This is, uh... How you say?...

41:26.972 --> 41:28.594
bullshit.

41:30.275 --> 41:31.775
I know, Riva...

41:33.378 --> 41:36.179
...because I'm the one
that tried to kill him.

41:38.083 --> 41:39.105
You?

41:40.652 --> 41:42.185
I'm impressed.

41:44.823 --> 41:46.389
Well, um...

41:46.425 --> 41:50.060
what I don't understand, though,
is why he's lying about it.

41:50.095 --> 41:52.495
You know Roller was giving us payment.

41:52.531 --> 41:53.763
Yes.

41:53.799 --> 41:58.668
Here is what you don't know...
Roller was working for us.

42:00.639 --> 42:04.207
This story requires three top coats.

42:04.242 --> 42:08.778
Turns out,
blood is not thicker than water.

42:09.581 --> 42:11.247
Oh.

42:11.283 --> 42:13.049
I'll be damned.

42:35.974 --> 42:37.574
Shit.

42:58.630 --> 43:01.498
Our Dixie friend is out for blood.

43:01.979 --> 43:05.650
Move meeting to tomorrow.
We need time to prepare.

43:18.016 --> 43:19.282
Whatchu want?

43:19.317 --> 43:21.017
We need to meet...

43:21.052 --> 43:22.166
now.

43:43.475 --> 43:45.475
Marina parking lot?

43:45.898 --> 43:47.243
I figured with people around,

43:47.279 --> 43:49.527
you wouldn't do nothin' stupid.

43:50.815 --> 43:53.583
I know what you been up to
with Riva and her crew.

43:53.618 --> 43:55.485
Oh, you been busy, huh? Hmm.

43:55.520 --> 43:58.254
I won't say a word to Uncle Daddy

43:58.290 --> 44:00.256
as long as you leave me
and Virginia alone.

44:00.292 --> 44:01.591
I jus...

44:01.626 --> 44:03.459
- That ain't gonna happen.
- Wait. What?

44:03.495 --> 44:05.428
By the end of this day,
you gonna be toastin' up

44:05.463 --> 44:06.930
with the Good Lord, baby.

44:06.965 --> 44:10.099
This is a bad move, Roller.
The girls know where I am.

44:10.135 --> 44:11.568
They know to tell Uncle Daddy

44:11.603 --> 44:12.835
- if anything happens to me!
- Get in the car!

44:12.871 --> 44:15.805
- No! Get off of me!
- Get in the car!

44:15.840 --> 44:16.906
Come her.

44:16.942 --> 44:18.508
Get off of me!

44:19.878 --> 44:22.946
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

44:22.981 --> 44:25.181
Some of the stuff that you said when...

44:25.217 --> 44:27.116
when you first came back, it was real.

44:27.152 --> 44:28.618
I know it was.

44:32.090 --> 44:33.823
Get in the car, bitch.
