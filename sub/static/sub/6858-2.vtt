00:17.767 --> 00:19.101
NARRATOR: Separatist attack!

00:19.185 --> 00:22.271
After the destruction
of the Republic outpost on the Rishi moon,

00:22.605 --> 00:26.525
General Grievous and Asajj Ventress
plan an attack on the planet Kamino,

00:26.651 --> 00:28.610
home of the cloning factories.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.946
Meanwhile, aboard a Jedi cruiser,

00:31.031 --> 00:33.949
Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker
and Obi-Wan Kenobi

00:34.284 --> 00:37.536
examine an intercepted message
from General Grievous.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.955
We are decrypting the audio, sir.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.417
The clone planet of Kamino
will be a dangerous target.

00:44.252 --> 00:47.629
Just make sure you hold up
your half of the mission.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.716
We must stop the production of new clones

00:50.800 --> 00:52.843
if we are to win this war.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.596
Kamino.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.931
They're going to attack our home planet.

00:58.683 --> 01:02.061
The Separatists are taking
quite the chance even considering this.

01:02.645 --> 01:06.398
With all due respect, General,
if someone comes to our home,

01:06.608 --> 01:08.817
they better be carrying a big blaster.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.780
I concur with Captain Rex, sir.
This is personal for us clones.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.823
We'll make sure Kamino is secure.

01:14.991 --> 01:18.160
Tell your troopers in the 501st
they're going home.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.328
Yes, sir!

01:28.046 --> 01:29.880
All is ready, General.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.717
Good. We will attack Tipoca City first.

01:34.177 --> 01:37.971
I have the exact locations of both
the clone DNA room

01:38.056 --> 01:39.848
and the clone trooper barracks.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.227
Both shall be annihilated under my hand.

01:43.645 --> 01:48.357
Our hands, General.
Count Dooku assigned us both this task.

01:48.733 --> 01:52.903
But of course, assassin.
I look forward to meeting you.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.533
Are the aqua droids prepared
for phase two of the plan?

01:57.575 --> 01:58.742
Yes mistress.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.441
Masters Kenobi and Skywalker.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.443
Welcome to Kamino.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.237
Greetings, Generals.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.615
I wish our arrival
wasn't under such circumstances.

02:38.908 --> 02:42.161
We believe Grievous is planning
a Separatist attack on Kamino.

02:42.912 --> 02:48.083
But the Republic blockade
is far too strong. They would not dare.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.965
Look around, Fives.
Feels like yesterday we were here.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.718
Heading to target practice.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.595
(CHUCKLES) Remember that?

03:00.096 --> 03:01.597
Do I ever.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.350
Hey, 99!

03:06.644 --> 03:08.437
Echo! Fives!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.647
You actually remember us?

03:11.107 --> 03:13.483
I remember all my brothers.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.612
Is Hevy here? Where's he?

03:17.447 --> 03:21.200
There was an incident
on the Rishi moon outpost.

03:21.534 --> 03:25.037
He saved our lives, but he gave up his own.

03:25.872 --> 03:26.872
Oh.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.207
I... I see.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.045
Hevy gave you his medal?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.965
So why have you returned to Kamino?

03:37.383 --> 03:40.177
The Generals received word
of an impending attack here.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.180
Well, how can I help?

03:53.191 --> 03:55.359
Attack formation Echo-3.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.029
-Status.
-Deflector shields raised.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.699
DROID 1: Destroyers in position.
DROID 2: Forward cannons ready.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.160
Landing craft prepared.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.331
All ships are in position.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.416
Commence attack!

04:21.511 --> 04:23.845
The Separatist fleet
is pressing their attack, sir.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.847
Contact command at Tipoca City.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.599
(SIREN RINGING)

04:29.852 --> 04:31.270
(CRAFT POWERING UP)

04:38.194 --> 04:39.653
Shore up our defenses.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.699
The fleet is not as large as I expected.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.909
Begin the air strike.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.128
Good to see you, General.
Ready to have some fun?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.879
You know me, Broadside.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.257
I'd rather be up here
than stuck in a command center.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.780
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Warning! Falling Debris.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.783
Grievous appears to be
sacrificing his transports

05:26.868 --> 05:28.869
in favor of protecting his command ship.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.038
Something's not right.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.929
Reinforcements have arrived.

05:48.264 --> 05:51.558
Send out the aqua droids
to assemble the assault craft.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.561
Focus on the cruisers!

06:05.323 --> 06:06.656
(BEEPING)

06:08.076 --> 06:09.785
I'm going to press the attack, Master.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.996
No, Anakin. Wait! It's too easy.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.332
Not even Grievous
would attack so recklessly.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.877
Master, the battle's up here in space,
not down there.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.547
The debris from the destroyed
Separatist ships is the key.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.299
What are you thinking?

06:24.675 --> 06:26.426
I think I'd like to go for a swim.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.140
(AIWHAS VOCALIZING)

06:40.858 --> 06:42.192
Nothing as of yet.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.195
Only you could be worried about the ships
I already shot down.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.491
Wait a minute!

06:52.995 --> 06:56.581
Aqua droids! It looks as though
they're assembling assault craft.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.590
Anakin, I was right!

07:05.716 --> 07:08.844
Those downed transports were hiding
ships for an underwater assault.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.220
Anakin, come in!

07:11.472 --> 07:14.182
Hold it right there! Do not move!

07:25.194 --> 07:26.194
(ALARM CHIRPING)

07:50.887 --> 07:52.220
(GASPING)

07:53.389 --> 07:54.764
Thanks for the lift, friend.

08:05.234 --> 08:09.404
Anakin, the city is under attack!
I need you down here now!

08:11.407 --> 08:12.782
On my way!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.250
Sir, you sent for us?

08:22.418 --> 08:23.585
It's a dangerous assignment,

08:23.669 --> 08:26.421
but I want you two up on the bridge
in sniper positions.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.006
Yes, sir, we're on it!

08:47.360 --> 08:48.610
Watch out!

09:53.259 --> 09:55.093
99, get out of here! (GRUNTS)

09:56.554 --> 09:58.138
This is no place for you.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.232
There aren't enough droids here
to capture the city.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.151
They're trying to distract us.

10:11.235 --> 10:14.446
Go protect the DNA chamber,
I'll deal with Grievous.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.572
Got it.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.964
Fives, keep firing! We can beat these guys!

10:36.260 --> 10:38.720
-99!
-I... I brought you some ammo.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.890
Is there a better spot than this?
A better defensive position we can take?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.099
Droids! Behind us!

10:44.226 --> 10:45.268
The grenades!

10:50.066 --> 10:51.983
Thanks, 99. Good job!

10:52.485 --> 10:53.902
Look out, there's more!

10:56.072 --> 10:58.031
Cadets! What are you doing here?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.741
We got separated from our group.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.243
-Where were they taking you?
-The barracks.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.162
Oh. I know the best way there!

11:04.747 --> 11:07.123
Keep firing! No mercy!

11:21.055 --> 11:22.430
(CHOKING)

11:39.782 --> 11:41.991
Your skills are impressive.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.495
Perhaps a match for my own, assassin.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.958
Count Dooku may have taught you
how to swing a lightsaber, General,

11:50.167 --> 11:52.877
but that hardly makes you my equal.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.631
And yet I am the General
in charge of this assault.

11:57.007 --> 12:01.136
Remember, assassin,
you are to recover the clone DNA.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.471
Why not just destroy it?

12:03.973 --> 12:07.642
Because the DNA could unlock
new possibilities for us.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.019
Keep playing with your droids.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.897
I'll handle breaking into the DNA room.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.485
Shall I provide you with a droid escort?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.904
My dear General,

12:19.989 --> 12:23.032
there's nothing you have that I could want.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.249
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

12:37.506 --> 12:38.590
What are we going to do?

12:39.550 --> 12:43.845
A Separatist victory means death.
For all of us.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.015
The cadet is right, what are we going to do?

12:47.099 --> 12:48.224
We fight.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.854
But our training's not finished.

12:53.355 --> 12:57.525
Look around, we're one and the same.
Same heart, same blood.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.195
Your training is in your blood.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.239
And my blood's boiling for a fight.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.534
This is our home. This is our war.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.203
What about weapons?

13:08.537 --> 13:10.079
The armory.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.584
Just a few corridors away,
here in the barracks.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.504
I can retrieve
all the firepower that we need.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.840
So, who wants to blast some droids?

13:37.066 --> 13:40.485
The droids are spread thin.
We must press our offensive now.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.673
(DOOR OPENS)

14:04.969 --> 14:08.555
I was beginning to think
my presence went unnoticed.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.015
You weren't planning on leaving
without saying hello, were you?

14:18.732 --> 14:21.234
Here it is. Everything we need is here.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.944
Excellent work, 99.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.113
Hurry up, the droids have almost
reached the barracks.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.447
Let's get into position.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.412
Open up.

14:32.621 --> 14:36.875
Get those doors open and scare
the remaining clones out of hiding.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.459
Roger, roger.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.673
Blast them!

14:46.760 --> 14:48.136
All too easy.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.640
Define easy, General.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.435
Kenobi!

15:39.355 --> 15:45.944
Kenobi, Kamino has fallen.
Your clone army is doomed.

execute you right now.

What any clone would've done.

20:14.922 --> 20:18.549
Both of you showed valor out there,
real courage.
