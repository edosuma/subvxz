WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.203
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Mary:
<i>We have confirmed reports</i>

00:04.205 --> 00:06.005
That the black death
has returned

00:06.007 --> 00:07.706
<i>Once more to plague our lands.</i>

00:07.708 --> 00:10.409
I understand all the reasons.
I do. I just can't.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.545
I won't let you take
my son from me.

00:13.547 --> 00:14.747
I will rise

00:14.749 --> 00:16.415
Until I am rich
and powerful.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.283
But I will never
be yours again.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.619
Is that your daughter
with leith?

00:20.621 --> 00:21.754
Mary:
<i>Eduard narcisse.</i>

00:21.756 --> 00:23.288
How may we help you?

00:23.290 --> 00:24.356
There's someone
I thought untouchable.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.624
I'd like him to die of plague.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.059
Food for survival...

00:27.061 --> 00:28.160
In exchange for one life.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.294
Every life matters!

00:29.296 --> 00:30.562
We will find grain elsewhere.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.365
You murdered
an entire household!

00:33.367 --> 00:35.601
Why make an enemy
out of those you need most?

00:35.603 --> 00:36.635
Justice.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.170
Take him away.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.572
My father will free me!
No, he won't.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.573
<i>Because he'll never find you.</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:43.575
No! Mary!

00:43.577 --> 00:45.644
No!

00:49.182 --> 00:52.051
(bird caws)

00:52.053 --> 00:54.086
â™ª they won't know

00:54.088 --> 00:57.189
â™ª who we are

00:57.191 --> 01:00.526
â™ª so we both can

01:00.528 --> 01:02.828
â™ª pretend...

01:02.830 --> 01:04.630
(groans)

01:04.632 --> 01:07.266
â™ª it's written
on the mountains... â™ª

01:07.268 --> 01:09.768
There's 12 corpses.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.804
All adults.

01:11.806 --> 01:15.307
No... No shovels, no hooks.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.109
Keep your gloves on
and wrap them with care.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.510
You should get
some rest, my lord.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.112
It's not your job
to handle the dead.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.580
It's ours.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.549
No, we have to give
them proper burial.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.617
So their souls can find rest.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.387
â™ª and the pieces broke

01:28.389 --> 01:32.558
â™ª and people wanted more

01:32.560 --> 01:35.127
â™ª and the

01:35.129 --> 01:36.862
â™ª rugged wheel

01:36.864 --> 01:40.299
â™ª is turning

01:40.301 --> 01:44.570
â™ª another round

01:44.572 --> 01:46.538
I knew he was alive.
I could feel it in my heart.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.207
Thank god you were right.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.109
Please don't tell
francis that I mistook

01:50.111 --> 01:51.410
My illness for the plague.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.711
It's embarrassing.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.646
(crowd clamoring)

01:54.648 --> 01:57.850
â™ª dorian...

01:57.852 --> 01:59.551
Mary.

02:01.521 --> 02:04.123
Where is lola?
Is she all right?

02:04.125 --> 02:05.624
(baby cooing)

02:08.361 --> 02:09.895
Mary.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.131
Lola.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.432
The-the child, is it...?

02:13.434 --> 02:15.501
I have a son.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.136
(baby crying)

02:17.138 --> 02:19.438
(women cooing)

02:23.910 --> 02:25.244
(shushes)

02:25.246 --> 02:28.514
Bash, oh, thank god
you're all right.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.382
We have to talk soon.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.384
I need an advisor I can trust.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.852
I want you on my council.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.787
You're already
talking politics.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.556
Because I am already king.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.258
I'm no politician, francis.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.792
I don't belong
on a privy council.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.427
It's a liar's job.

02:42.429 --> 02:45.464
â™ª dorian, carrion

02:45.466 --> 02:47.332
Mary?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.268
I'd like you to meet
the man that saved our lives.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.402
My cousin.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.438
Louis of conde.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.475
Oh, he's easy on the eyes,
isn't he?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.944
â™ª will you ever let...

02:58.946 --> 03:00.546
Thank you for bringing
them home safely.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.848
Thank you so very much.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.317
It was an honor.
As is this.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.353
You and your men must rest here
before you leave.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.889
(women laughing)

03:30.777 --> 03:33.312
Your kisses are more
easily attained

03:33.314 --> 03:35.681
Than your words.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.849
I left impulsively.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.619
You did.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.922
And now I have returned
with lola's child.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.493
I held him and...

03:50.763 --> 03:52.864
I don't know what role
he'll have at court,

03:52.866 --> 03:55.300
But I want to be
a part of my son's life.

03:55.302 --> 03:58.370
Of this child's life,
but we will have others.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.472
Mary, my father's
indiscretions

04:00.474 --> 04:03.508
Were blatant, but out
of respect for his wife,

04:03.510 --> 04:05.978
He gave bash no
title or standing.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.779
It hurt him.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.748
And it hurt me to see it.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.385
The eyes of the world are
watching to see if we will...

04:13.387 --> 04:15.887
If I can bear an heir.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.589
Not just for France.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.791
For scotland.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.393
And for England as well.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.262
I know this has nothing to do

04:23.264 --> 04:25.264
With the role you decide
to have in your son's life...

04:25.266 --> 04:27.799
Well, perhaps it should.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.534
Those who are close to us...

04:29.536 --> 04:31.503
Even here at court
will know the truth.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.539
Your mother has
guessed it already.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.875
Spend time with your son
absolutely, but...

04:36.877 --> 04:38.510
But don't claim him.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.279
Officially, you mean.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.014
Yes.

04:43.816 --> 04:46.351
Thank you.

04:47.754 --> 04:50.289
I'm surprised to see you.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.559
My deepest sympathies

04:54.561 --> 04:56.528
For the loss
of your son eduard.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.063
Can I get you anything?
Some lemonade?

04:58.065 --> 05:01.500
I thought this castle would
be the safest place for him.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.702
Why wasn't it?

05:07.607 --> 05:10.475
Bring us some whiskey.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.477
Lord narcisse is here.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.380
Asking a lot of questions
about his son's death.

05:15.382 --> 05:17.716
I explained that he showed
symptoms of plague,

05:17.718 --> 05:19.384
High fever, rash.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.886
You are good to cover for me.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.521
Lord narcisse will never know.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.855
His son did die of plague.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.725
His body will tell the tale.

05:26.727 --> 05:30.729
Eduard murdered an entire
household to kill one foe.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.597
Since he cared so
little for people,

05:32.599 --> 05:34.766
It's fitting that he
died among the lowborn.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.868
I have asked much of you--
not the least

05:36.870 --> 05:39.738
That you betray your very
dangerous friend catherine.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.741
She was mortified that she
overreacted to her symptoms.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.910
She hates being vulnerable.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.946
But it is hard
not to enjoy it.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.917
We tried to save lives.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.385
I owe you.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.454
And I will protect you.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.526
So many people died here.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.429
Nobles, servants alike.

06:04.431 --> 06:07.966
I was in my chambers
when your son took ill.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.536
But nostradamus, he...
Yes.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.839
I've already spoken with
your court physician.

06:13.841 --> 06:17.008
A-a father can't
help but wonder

06:17.010 --> 06:19.978
About his son's final days.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.748
I survived by fleeing
to the country.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.717
I feel that I should've
sent for him.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.387
There was nothing
you could do.

06:28.389 --> 06:31.156
I need to go see him now.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.958
You do understand, don't you?

06:37.930 --> 06:40.532
(groans)

06:44.036 --> 06:46.071
When was this room sealed?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.706
Two weeks ago, my lord.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.876
Most nobles died
in their chambers.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.578
Were many nobles
sent here by mistake?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.080
Couldn't say, sir.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.149
It was a living hell.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.652
Do you see him?

07:00.654 --> 07:03.021
Not yet.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.635
That is my son.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.705
Wrap him.

07:20.707 --> 07:21.807
Carefully.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.976
(moaning nearby)

07:24.978 --> 07:27.045
Who's there?

07:29.582 --> 07:31.450
This one is still alive.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.118
How could anyone
still be alive?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.219
He must be immune.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.887
Water.

07:35.889 --> 07:39.558
That is my son.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.460
Were you with him?

07:41.462 --> 07:42.561
Did you see him die?

07:44.030 --> 07:47.599
We will get you some water
and something to eat.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.101
And then you are
going tell me

07:50.103 --> 07:52.537
All about
what happened to my son.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.482
(laughter, clamoring)

08:03.484 --> 08:06.084
Ah, this is nothing compared

08:06.086 --> 08:07.986
To what we'll do
for your coronation.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.189
But your safe return is
cause for celebration.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.159
It's nice to see some joy in
this castle after so much grief.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.795
I hear you had a hand
in our new chambers as well.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.964
One bedroom for
husband and wife.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.832
Good luck to both
of you with that.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.171
I thought narcisse was leaving

08:26.173 --> 08:28.006
With his son's body.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.009
Why is he back with
so many nobles?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.911
King francis.

08:32.913 --> 08:33.979
Narcisse.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.714
My lords.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.949
I'm pleased to see you're
all alive and well.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.951
In the wake of the plague,
I will be calling on all of you

08:39.953 --> 08:41.720
To enforce my laws.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.989
Together you control
vast regions of France.

08:43.991 --> 08:47.092
Some of you will be valued
additions to my royal council.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.927
Of course, king francis.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.296
But we're here to ask
something of you as well.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.998
Justice.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.166
What's this about exactly?

08:55.168 --> 08:58.136
My son eduard...

08:58.138 --> 08:59.938
Was murdered.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.107
Here in your castle
while you were away.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.144
By nostradamus,
the court physician.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.814
I don't know what grudge
you held against my son.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.149
I had no argument with him.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.785
Then why did you make
false diagnosis?

09:13.787 --> 09:16.755
Why did you condemn him
to death?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.890
These are serious allegations.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.159
My son was healthy
when he was thrown in

09:21.161 --> 09:23.562
With servants
riddled with plague.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.031
I know this because
a witness, a survivor,

09:26.033 --> 09:27.666
Has told me this tale.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.901
My son

09:29.903 --> 09:32.103
Was deliberately infected.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.040
I assure you,
if a mistake was made,

09:35.042 --> 09:38.109
Nostradamus intended no harm.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.111
Assure us all...

09:40.113 --> 09:43.181
Your loyal nobility,
that we are still safe

09:43.183 --> 09:45.183
Under your rule.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.786
We who collect your coin,
we who grow your food,

09:47.788 --> 09:49.254
We who provide your soldiers,

09:49.256 --> 09:52.057
We who uphold your laws.

09:52.059 --> 09:55.060
Hold the murderer
of my son accountable

09:55.062 --> 09:57.362
To these same laws.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.998
And show us that no life,
especially

10:00.000 --> 10:02.734
One of our own,
may be taken with impunity.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.170
(gasping, murmuring)

10:07.006 --> 10:08.106
Take nostradamus
away for questioning.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.279
Eduard murdered an
entire household--

10:14.281 --> 10:15.814
Men, women and children.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.616
I did what I had to.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.951
And narcisse knows it was you
who killed his son?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.252
I was the one who forced
eduard into the plague room

10:21.254 --> 10:22.287
Against his will.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.822
If there was a survivor,

10:23.824 --> 10:25.256
He would have
witnessed everything.

10:25.258 --> 10:28.026
There was another survivor
of your crimes, mary.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.260
Me.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.296
You drugged me,
didn't you?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.164
You were so adamant
to stand up

10:33.166 --> 10:34.733
To the nobles,
and I got sick

10:34.735 --> 10:36.234
Just when you needed
me out of the way.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.403
I had to stop you.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.771
Oh, you wouldn't delve into
my poisons without help.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.139
It was
nostradamus.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.008
Your actions

10:43.010 --> 10:45.977
Spared no one,
saved nothing

10:45.979 --> 10:47.879
And cost us
all dearly.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.781
Narcisse wants the guards
who brought his son

10:49.783 --> 10:51.650
To the catacombs
executed as well.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.786
We don't have to accede
to his demands.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.788
You and henry might have
bowed to the nobles,

10:56.790 --> 10:58.056
But we won't.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.424
We kept the
nobles happy.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.792
If they feel
betrayed,

11:00.794 --> 11:02.060
They can rise
up against you.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.862
I've seen revolts
firsthand,

11:03.864 --> 11:06.064
A full-scale rebellion could
mean the end of your reign.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.267
I know that you want
to do things differently,

11:09.269 --> 11:11.069
But I'm not sure
that this is the time.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.337
The plague shortages have given

11:12.339 --> 11:13.805
Too much power to narcisse.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.006
The nobles follow him now,

11:15.008 --> 11:16.741
And they are watching
our every move.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.677
Then let them
watch you,

11:18.679 --> 11:21.146
And that you be
above reproach.

11:21.148 --> 11:24.049
This was my mistake
and I'll fix it.

11:26.218 --> 11:29.120
(indistinct conversation,
hammer clinking)

11:29.122 --> 11:30.889
(horse whinnies)

11:33.225 --> 11:35.694
Man:
Whoa.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.830
Oh...

11:38.832 --> 11:40.165
Lord
castleroy.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.837
Wasn't this enough for you?

11:45.839 --> 11:49.140
A kitchen boy, given some of
the best lands in the region.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.176
You had to have
my daughter, too?

11:51.178 --> 11:54.245
Lord castleroy,
I am so sorry.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.980
Yvette was kind and...

11:55.982 --> 11:58.116
She was everything
you told greer you wanted.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.018
Rich and innocent

12:00.020 --> 12:02.253
And my daughter.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.254
How greer would
have suffered

12:03.256 --> 12:05.323
To see your rise,

12:05.325 --> 12:06.958
And what a close view
she'd have had.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.259
I can assure you
that I didn't realize

12:08.261 --> 12:09.828
Who she was until after we...

12:09.830 --> 12:11.162
If my daughter
had never met you,

12:11.164 --> 12:12.363
She would be alive!

12:12.365 --> 12:14.199
I would never have hurt her.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.500
Castleroy:
I don't know that,

12:15.502 --> 12:18.103
And neither do you.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.938
Given the proximity you
would have had to the woman

12:19.940 --> 12:22.207
I know you love.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.241
Look, please, just...
Look, wait...

12:23.243 --> 12:25.143
Greer:
Leith, no!
(grunts)

12:25.145 --> 12:27.445
Stay away from my family.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.913
Or I will destroy you.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.761
Queen mary.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.930
Where is your husband?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.332
I would prefer it
if we settled

12:47.334 --> 12:48.967
This matter
privately.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.036
I think you know who's
truly responsible

12:52.038 --> 12:53.338
For eduard's
death.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.939
You are.

12:54.941 --> 12:58.443
But, as you
are a queen,

12:58.445 --> 13:01.012
You're nearly untouchable.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.548
Nearly.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.885
But those that
lied for you,

13:06.887 --> 13:10.421
I can reach easily enough.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.390
That is how I will punish you.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.993
Your son was
a monster.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.862
He asked me to
murder his enemy,

13:17.864 --> 13:20.398
And when
I refused,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.867
He poisoned an
entire household.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.536
Why didn't you arrest him?

13:24.538 --> 13:27.405
I let my anger get
the best of me.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.907
And my outrage.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.975
And what of mine?

13:32.511 --> 13:34.879
He was my son!

13:34.881 --> 13:36.514
He was loyal

13:36.516 --> 13:38.049
And obedient

13:38.051 --> 13:40.218
And he had his whole life
ahead of him.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.988
He was to marry an archduchess,

13:43.990 --> 13:46.925
Gain one of the most prized
farming regions in France...

13:46.927 --> 13:48.993
He was to marry into land?

13:50.429 --> 13:52.564
He told me he was
already married.

13:52.566 --> 13:55.567
That voland had slept
with his wife.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.535
Why did he really
want voland dead?

14:00.072 --> 14:02.373
You also said
he was obedient.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.942
Was he following
your orders?

14:03.944 --> 14:05.510
I am queen.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.946
You will answer my questions.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.480
Why did you want voland dead?

14:09.482 --> 14:10.882
I command you!

14:10.884 --> 14:12.617
No, you command nothing!

14:15.187 --> 14:16.521
I don't fear you,

14:16.523 --> 14:19.224
I don't fear your husband!

14:19.226 --> 14:21.459
Because without me,
without the other nobles,

14:21.461 --> 14:23.294
Your power disappears.

14:25.164 --> 14:29.334
We are the outside world,

14:29.336 --> 14:31.936
And we surround you.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.643
There is a consensus

14:38.645 --> 14:40.879
Amongst the other nobles,

14:40.881 --> 14:42.313
Given my son's station,

14:42.315 --> 14:43.982
That an example must be made.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.018
So when the dawn comes,
nostradamus and your guards

14:47.020 --> 14:48.953
Will be drawn and quartered.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.291
That is a horrific

14:53.293 --> 14:55.026
And agonizing death.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.162
This is what they want.

14:58.164 --> 15:02.233
This is what
will satisfy them.

15:03.469 --> 15:07.272
And you will learn
never to cross me again.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.014
My mother's
been negotiating

15:16.016 --> 15:17.548
To spare nostradamus,
but it's no use.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.950
Narcisse wants
retribution,

15:18.952 --> 15:20.351
And he has the nobles
on his side.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.553
Murdering innocent men
to teach me a lesson.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.088
He's more wicked
than his son.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.490
Why didn't you wait?

15:25.492 --> 15:27.292
You could have
had him arrested.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.227
If I had, narcisse would have
pressured us to release him.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.561
We'd be in the same
position we're in now:

15:30.563 --> 15:32.096
With him trying
to force your hand.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.364
If his son were alive,

15:33.366 --> 15:35.333
Narcisse wouldn't be
consumed with revenge.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.335
It was reckless, mary.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.237
I saw an entire
family be murdered.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.571
My rage took hold.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.973
It might not have been
the best decision,

15:41.975 --> 15:43.174
But it was justified.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.243
It was a choice
that you made alone.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.112
What is it?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.481
I know I told you
to go to lola,

15:50.483 --> 15:52.183
But then the
plague came

15:52.185 --> 15:54.352
And you knowingly
abandoned me
to a nightmare.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.654
You are the king who
deserted his castle,

15:56.656 --> 15:59.958
And I am the queen who
was left behind, alone.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.427
Alone because of
your mistakes.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.562
Out of all the people
you could have slept with,

16:04.564 --> 16:06.531
Did it have to be
one of my ladies?

16:06.533 --> 16:08.967
One of my
closest friends?

16:10.469 --> 16:12.403
We can't afford to do this now.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.308
If you bow to
narcisse now,

16:17.310 --> 16:19.143
You'll be doing it for
the rest of your rule.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.045
What kind of king
do you want to be?

16:21.047 --> 16:22.680
I've been trying to figure out
what kind of king I <i>can</i> be.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.416
Whether there is a way
to stop this execution

16:25.418 --> 16:27.051
Without destroying
my relationship

16:27.053 --> 16:29.620
With some very
powerful nobles.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.156
If only we had something
to leverage against narcisse,

16:32.158 --> 16:33.591
We could force him to back down.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.194
Conde suspects
narcisse

16:36.196 --> 16:38.363
Of murdering families
to take their lands.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.164
I'll send my brother
to the villages

16:40.166 --> 16:41.766
Where he acquired property
during the plague.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.102
You're looking for
evidence of murder.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.303
Something to
blackmail him with.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.571
Anything.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.473
What is it?

16:48.475 --> 16:49.774
I believe

16:49.776 --> 16:52.210
Eduard was acting on
his father's orders.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.112
I don't know why narcisse
wanted voland dead,

16:54.114 --> 16:56.047
But I'm going
to try and find out.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.182
The execution
is at dawn.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.686
I promised nostradamus
my protection.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.722
One way or another,
we have to find something.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.724
Maid:
These are lord voland's
chambers.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.060
Mary:
Leave me. Thank you.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.575
Lola:
Mary.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.344
Lola, what are
you doing here?

17:26.346 --> 17:28.613
Francis explained your
situation with narcisse.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.248
I wanted to help.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.216
Francis shared
that with you?

17:32.218 --> 17:33.518
I was with francis

17:33.520 --> 17:34.786
When we met narcisse
on the road.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.588
It gave me chills
to see him here at court.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.223
I could see

17:39.225 --> 17:41.192
Francis was troubled and
I asked him what was wrong.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.326
When was this?

17:42.328 --> 17:44.128
When he asked me

17:44.130 --> 17:45.329
How the baby was doing.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.498
Mary,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.534
I know our situation
is painful...

17:49.536 --> 17:51.369
And for you, too.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.273
Does he have a name yet?

17:55.275 --> 17:56.741
I call him robert,

17:56.743 --> 17:58.276
After my youngest brother.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.477
If francis
claims him,

17:59.479 --> 18:01.112
He may choose
another name.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.281
I suppose it would be best
for you, if he did.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.783
You'd rise above
speculation
and gossip.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.686
You would both gain
status and respect.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.655
I just want to be with my child.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.623
The more time I spend with him,

18:12.625 --> 18:14.692
The less anything else
seems to matter.

18:18.797 --> 18:21.265
It's all right to take joy
in being a mother.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.201
You don't have to
hide that from me.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.737
What is it?

18:28.540 --> 18:30.174
It's from the
privy council,

18:30.176 --> 18:32.243
To lord voland.

18:33.645 --> 18:36.114
"in response to your
urgent request..."

18:36.116 --> 18:38.816
It says voland was desperately
seeking an audience

18:38.818 --> 18:40.318
With the king before he died.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.553
Well, you said you want to help.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.856
I need you to find out
whatever you can

18:44.858 --> 18:46.557
About voland's final hours.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.593
He wanted to tell
francis something...

18:48.595 --> 18:50.895
I need to know what it was.

18:59.571 --> 19:00.872
It <i>is</i> you.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.840
When they announced
that you were here,

19:02.842 --> 19:04.809
I, uh... I didn't believe it.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.878
I feel as if I betrayed you.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.682
I didn't mean to tell
lord castleroy what you said.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.452
What you said
in anger.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.320
But at
the time...

19:16.322 --> 19:18.723
You thought it was true.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.226
That I would steal the heart
of another just to wound yours.

19:22.228 --> 19:24.395
I was upset when I saw
you and yvette together.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.698
I realized how jealous
I sounded to lord castleroy,

19:27.700 --> 19:29.433
So I told him your words.

19:29.435 --> 19:32.336
As if it was just my concern
for his daughter.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.740
I did it to protect myself.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.408
You're good at that, aren't you?

19:37.410 --> 19:38.843
Not really.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.711
I've poisoned everything.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.648
There's little but hate and
mistrust between all of us.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.449
(sighs)

19:45.451 --> 19:46.918
I wish I could
turn back time,

19:46.920 --> 19:48.619
But I can't.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.954
I'm sorry.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.591
I'm sorry and...

19:53.593 --> 19:54.892
I pray the day will come

19:54.894 --> 19:56.827
When I no longer regret
that I loved you.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.775
Please don't blame yourself
for yvette's death.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.376
If I'd let you
go to her...

20:12.378 --> 20:13.844
Never tell your fiancÃ© that.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.646
Let it be,
greer.

20:15.648 --> 20:16.847
What's done
is done.

20:16.849 --> 20:20.851
Don't cause him any more pain.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.920
Let that be a vow
that we both keep.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.289
You should go.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.925
Don't come back.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.430
Bash:
I'm investigating lord narcisse.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.298
I've heard many of the dead
lost their lands to him.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.533
Gravedigger:
They were murdered.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.301
He plucked the deeds
to their lands

20:37.303 --> 20:39.437
From their stiff,
cold fingers.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.905
Or so I'm told.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.640
Do you have
any proof?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.542
There's proof
of murders,

20:44.544 --> 20:46.844
Theirs and plenty of others,

20:46.846 --> 20:49.380
If you want to dig it up.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.315
It's all under there,

20:51.317 --> 20:52.917
Buried with the rest
of the unfortunates.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.785
In the same
mass grave

20:54.787 --> 20:56.787
With all the actual
plague victims.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.556
Corpses came by the cartful,

20:58.558 --> 21:00.491
The sick and the murdered.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.627
And once they're
tossed in...

21:02.629 --> 21:04.629
Who's going to ask questions?

21:04.631 --> 21:06.631
(sighs)

21:08.634 --> 21:09.967
Don't take it
too hard, my lord.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.902
Same thing happens
every plague.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.504
Justice suffers and dies

21:13.506 --> 21:16.040
With the rest of us.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.309
Woman:
<i>Deesh-kin...</i>

21:18.311 --> 21:20.811
<i>Aarin kir mograndee.</i>

21:20.813 --> 21:22.580
Who are you?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.715
Why are you doing that?

21:24.717 --> 21:26.817
From the castle,
now, are you?
I am.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.919
I hear the nobles
locked themselves in

21:28.921 --> 21:30.921
With cakes and fine wines,

21:30.923 --> 21:33.057
While we watched
our loved ones rot

21:33.059 --> 21:35.593
And turn black before our eyes.

21:35.595 --> 21:36.861
There were many deaths
at court as well.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.829
Bury them well, mind you.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.465
So many.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.568
Wickedly mistreated,
not just in life, but in death.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.937
Do people really
expect them to go?

21:46.939 --> 21:49.006
What do you mean?
It's hard enough

21:49.008 --> 21:51.676
To get spirits
to leave us, but now?

21:51.678 --> 21:53.344
There's a door

21:53.346 --> 21:55.012
Between the dead and the living,

21:55.014 --> 21:57.448
And the plague kicked it down.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.950
And if the dead
aren't guided through...

21:59.952 --> 22:02.486
The door stays open.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.822
The door is open.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.891
They'll get to us
before you know it.

22:06.893 --> 22:07.925
There will be...

22:07.927 --> 22:10.628
A reckoning.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.102
Mary:
<i>So we have no proof to use</i>

22:18.104 --> 22:19.770
Against narcisse
unless we want to dig up

22:19.772 --> 22:21.372
Mass graves
and release the plague?

22:21.374 --> 22:22.640
If narcisse

22:22.642 --> 22:23.974
Is using the plague
to cover his crimes,

22:23.976 --> 22:25.576
He's not the only one.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.944
Neighbors, catholics,
protestants--

22:26.946 --> 22:28.412
They're killing each other.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.947
Even a cardinal's
body was found

22:29.949 --> 22:31.649
In an alley with
his throat slit.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.651
A cardinal? Who?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.920
Cardinal morosini, killed
for the gold in his vestments,

22:35.922 --> 22:38.789
They say.
(door closes)

22:40.525 --> 22:42.126
I'm here to see mary.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.595
What did you find?

22:44.597 --> 22:45.730
I spoke with a castle page.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.398
Before lord voland
joined his family

22:47.400 --> 22:49.533
In their chambers, he insisted
on taking confession.

22:49.535 --> 22:52.103
I had to bribe a few altar boys,
but I got the priest's name.

22:52.105 --> 22:55.039
Father lucien.

22:57.876 --> 23:01.545
Where do we find this priest?

23:03.415 --> 23:05.015
You look troubled, brother.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.817
I know you call
nostradamus friend.

23:06.819 --> 23:07.985
I do.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.787
And he's a friend
we may need.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.655
What do you mean?

23:11.657 --> 23:14.525
He has certain skills.

23:14.527 --> 23:17.428
And I know that you don't
believe in them or the occult.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.931
But something has
changed out there.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.135
There's talk in the village
that the dead are still with us.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.437
People feel guilty
for surviving.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.872
They torture themselves.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.907
No, a guard heard
screams of the dying

23:29.909 --> 23:31.909
From an empty room.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.512
Servants claim that old castle
ghosts have returned.

23:34.514 --> 23:37.948
And a woman in the village
claims that all this death

23:37.950 --> 23:39.950
And injustice has left
a door open

23:39.952 --> 23:41.786
Between this world and the next
and some of the dead

23:41.788 --> 23:43.521
Are on the wrong side of it.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.056
Still here among the living?

23:46.058 --> 23:50.027
And that they stay because
they were treated wrongly.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.829
Either not given proper burial

23:51.831 --> 23:53.164
Or cut down unjustly.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.800
Murdered.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.702
What does this woman
think the dead want?

23:58.704 --> 24:00.638
The truth revealed.

24:00.640 --> 24:04.675
You mean revenge.

24:08.146 --> 24:11.015
I loved henry.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.617
But he was a terrible husband
and a worse father.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.019
What kind of a father

24:15.021 --> 24:16.854
Do you hope to be?

24:16.856 --> 24:18.155
Nothing like him.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.024
Really?

24:20.026 --> 24:22.159
Then what will you do
about lola's child?

24:22.161 --> 24:24.528
Will you claim him?

24:27.799 --> 24:29.667
I haven't decided.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.503
You must be worried
he might be your only child.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.004
I'm speaking to you
as a mother.

24:34.006 --> 24:37.141
As your mother.

24:37.143 --> 24:40.644
I can tell you that
if you do not claim him,

24:40.646 --> 24:43.180
There will be a distance
between you and that boy

24:43.182 --> 24:45.516
For the rest of your lives.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.551
He will never be king.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.920
But he might be
your only chance

24:49.922 --> 24:51.789
At being a father.

24:51.791 --> 24:55.025
And I can promise you
that raising him

24:55.027 --> 24:58.963
Will be the singular joy
of your life.

25:01.933 --> 25:04.668
(door creaks)

25:04.670 --> 25:06.537
Aloysius.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.639
I was just going to change
and meet you downstairs.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.774
Your servants said
you went into town.
Yes, I bought

25:10.776 --> 25:12.042
Some things for the children.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.011
You were gone a long while.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.847
â™ª when it's all falling apart

25:16.849 --> 25:18.582
â™ª I'll be the one...

25:18.584 --> 25:19.783
I went to see leith.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.753
I know you are
in pain,

25:22.755 --> 25:24.755
But there's no need
for such animosity.

25:24.757 --> 25:25.890
Leith is racked

25:25.892 --> 25:27.258
With guilt.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.792
I am, too.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.594
You must know
I'm loyal to you.

25:30.596 --> 25:33.764
â™ª and you can't find
the spark... â™ª

25:33.766 --> 25:37.101
I have been wondering
about your loyalty of late.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.636
Leith's vow...

25:38.638 --> 25:40.271
Was said... In the moment,

25:40.273 --> 25:41.939
In anger.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.073
I chose you.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.975
You chose the life
I could give you.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.577
I chose you,

25:46.579 --> 25:48.612
And you chose me knowing
that I'd loved another,

25:48.614 --> 25:49.747
That I had done

25:49.749 --> 25:51.148
Ruinous things
for that love.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.783
You knew that
about me.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.652
I didn't know how it would feel.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.587
â™ª it's all gone...

25:56.589 --> 26:01.091
I have business that
will take me away for some time.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.793
How long?

26:02.795 --> 26:04.194
I don't know.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.564
I'll be seeing
my younger children as well.

26:06.566 --> 26:10.868
I need to be the one to tell
them that their sister is dead.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.870
Will you be back?

26:12.872 --> 26:14.605
I don't know.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.707
â™ª together

26:16.709 --> 26:18.842
â™ª I'll be there.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.744
<i>I'm not afraid</i>

26:20.746 --> 26:23.614
Of breaking my vows,
queen mary.

26:23.616 --> 26:26.350
What I do fear
is lord narcisse.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.886
I will stand
against him.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.021
Father, I made a mistake
a few weeks ago,

26:31.023 --> 26:33.958
And now innocent men could pay
for it with their lives.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.893
Whatever voland told you
could save them.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.361
Please help me.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.963
(crickets chirping)

26:38.965 --> 26:41.298
Lord voland worked
with narcisse.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.768
They collected money for the
vatican, but greed interfered,

26:44.770 --> 26:47.705
And they kept some of the
church's gold for themselves.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.974
Cardinal morosini
discovered their crime.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.909
Cardinal morosini?

26:51.911 --> 26:53.978
He was found dead

26:53.980 --> 26:56.113
In a neighboring village.
Protestants
were blamed

26:56.115 --> 26:57.181
But never identified.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.849
I know the truth.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.918
It was narcisse and voland
who killed him.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.853
Voland's heart
filled with remorse.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.722
Narcisse knew his resolve
was weakening,

27:04.724 --> 27:07.658
So before voland could confess
to your king or to the church...

27:07.660 --> 27:08.993
He had him killed.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.195
Along with his entire family.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.097
(sighs)
you understand

27:13.099 --> 27:16.133
We could destroy narcisse
with this.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.801
The vatican would strip
him of his power.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.103
You must testify
to the king

27:19.105 --> 27:21.405
And to the assembled nobles
at court.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.340
But what I've told you
I can never repeat.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.209
I'm just a lowly priest;
narcisse has people everywhere.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.711
I'd be dead
in the blink of an eye.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.079
He killed a cardinal!

27:29.081 --> 27:30.714
I could compel you.

27:30.716 --> 27:33.017
For information taken
in holy confession?

27:33.019 --> 27:35.219
The vatican itself
can't hear it.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.021
It doesn't exist.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.425
I know that your wife...

27:41.427 --> 27:43.127
She is your queen.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.996
I know that your queen
is working against me

27:45.998 --> 27:47.364
To stop the execution.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.099
She doesn't value
my friendship,

27:49.101 --> 27:50.834
But you should.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.837
Because you are a true friend
to the crown.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.273
Hmm. You don't like me,

27:56.275 --> 27:58.308
But you need me.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.712
My lands feed your people,

28:01.714 --> 28:03.347
Your court.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.883
I kept henry afloat
long after his wars

28:05.885 --> 28:07.785
Plunged France
into debt.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.887
I am aware
of the crown's debts.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.690
But not how in debt
it is to me.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.058
I heard about the execution.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.392
If lord narcisse demanded it,

28:15.394 --> 28:17.027
Those men are
certainly innocent.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.462
Careful of your accusations.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.431
I could make some of my own.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.866
You've made them to others;
you can make them to me.

28:22.868 --> 28:26.837
I believe this man to be
a secret protestant,

28:26.839 --> 28:30.140
A radical, practicing
the faith of your enemies

28:30.142 --> 28:31.442
In England
and germany.

28:31.444 --> 28:33.177
Is this true?

28:33.179 --> 28:36.080
No. I am a catholic
and a frenchman.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.949
But I believe France
should be ruled by you,

28:38.951 --> 28:41.018
Not by blood money from rome.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.886
The vatican is corrupt--
they're betraying their faith

28:42.888 --> 28:45.122
By allowing the strong
to prey on the weak.
You've proved

28:45.124 --> 28:46.356
My case for me.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.158
He is a radical.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.061
A catholic who hates
the catholic church.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.197
I hate any man
that hides behind god

28:53.199 --> 28:55.499
While they murder and steal.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.501
Men like narcisse,

28:57.503 --> 29:00.003
Protected by the
church and the crown.

29:00.005 --> 29:02.072
Your father
built his power

29:02.074 --> 29:04.208
By giving the nobles
what they wanted.

29:04.210 --> 29:07.177
If he were here now,
he would let those men die.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.012
And what do you
expect him to do,

29:09.014 --> 29:11.448
Risk disenfranchising
the nobles he depends on?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.917
Well, maybe it's time
we change things,

29:13.919 --> 29:16.086
Shift the power
back to where it belongs,

29:16.088 --> 29:18.756
With you, our king.

29:20.225 --> 29:23.761
You're unsure
of who to trust.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.063
Yes, I am.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.766
Then trust no one but yourself.

29:28.768 --> 29:31.935
Trust your sense of what
is right and what is wrong.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.804
Because when
the dawn comes

29:33.806 --> 29:35.339
And those men are let
outside, you'll have

29:35.341 --> 29:37.775
To decide what kind
of king you want to be.

29:43.081 --> 29:46.183
(birds chirping)

29:47.952 --> 29:49.553
(sighs)

29:50.488 --> 29:52.523
Have they hurt you?

29:52.525 --> 29:55.192
(door closes)

29:55.194 --> 29:58.095
They're going
to lead me out soon.

29:58.097 --> 30:01.265
For last rites.

30:01.267 --> 30:05.068
Are you going to share
your plan with me?

30:05.070 --> 30:07.805
I'm afraid there is no plan,

30:07.807 --> 30:08.972
My old friend.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.240
I'm so sorry.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.376
But I shall make sure
you are remembered.

30:12.378 --> 30:13.544
All your works

30:13.546 --> 30:15.279
Will be published.

30:15.281 --> 30:18.115
I will have sonnets written...

30:18.117 --> 30:21.852
And... A statue built in paris.

30:21.854 --> 30:24.421
A statue?
Mm.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.859
After all I've done for you!

30:28.861 --> 30:31.829
Do not blame me
for the choices you have made!

30:31.831 --> 30:33.530
If you had stayed
loyal to me,

30:33.532 --> 30:35.499
Eduard would
still be alive,

30:35.501 --> 30:37.367
None of this would
have happened. You...

30:37.369 --> 30:40.838
You brought this on yourself
when you helped mary.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.975
There is nothing I can do.

30:49.247 --> 30:51.548
You think you're untouchable...

30:51.550 --> 30:54.585
That your sins will stay buried,

30:54.587 --> 30:56.553
But they don't.

30:56.555 --> 31:00.557
Surely you realized that
when you met your daughter.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.092
Clarissa?

31:02.094 --> 31:04.061
She's dead and buried now.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.495
Mary killed her.

31:11.469 --> 31:14.571
You thought clarissa's death
fulfilled the prophecy.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.340
And that is why
I supported

31:16.342 --> 31:18.976
Francis marrying...

31:22.347 --> 31:24.948
Is clarissa alive?

31:24.950 --> 31:27.885
Tell me, nostradamus.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.419
Have you seen her?

31:29.421 --> 31:31.455
Have you had
another vision?

31:31.457 --> 31:34.358
Will francis live beyond
the death you once foresaw?

31:34.360 --> 31:36.593
Ask your statue.

31:41.532 --> 31:43.600
â™ª

31:58.950 --> 32:00.183
Conde.

32:00.185 --> 32:01.685
Where are
the royals?

32:01.687 --> 32:03.921
I suppose they've chosen
to look the other way.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.156
Someone must bear witness
to this travesty.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.159
Innocent men
shouldn't die alone.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.261
You won't die alone.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.480
They're preparing for

32:30.482 --> 32:32.049
The drawing and quartering
as we speak.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.383
We must do something.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.519
We don't have any leverage
against narcisse.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.120
We have the truth
on our side

32:37.122 --> 32:38.322
And we have you.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.324
You are king.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.725
Doesn't that count
for something?

32:41.727 --> 32:43.260
Yeah, well,
it's not enough, mary.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.995
We need something that
we can hold in our hands.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.396
Well, perhaps lord
voland kept a journal.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.065
Or wrote a letter.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.067
I have lola
looking now.
We're out of time.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.669
I can't let these men
die for my mistake.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.005
Narcisse:
Do you know why
they wrap the bindings

32:55.007 --> 32:56.273
All up the arms and legs?

32:56.275 --> 32:59.276
For a good,
clean break.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.111
I've seen it done
the other way, too,

33:01.113 --> 33:03.680
Bonds at the
wrists and ankles

33:03.682 --> 33:06.083
Taking off just
the hands and feet.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.185
You bleed to death
as the one horse

33:08.187 --> 33:10.654
Takes the lead
and drags you behind.

33:13.057 --> 33:15.325
Which do you think
will be more painful?

33:15.327 --> 33:16.626
Your death or my son's?

33:16.628 --> 33:19.162
I've seen your death.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.430
You'll suffer, too.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.432
And I have seen the suffering

33:22.434 --> 33:25.569
On every inch
of my son's corpse.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.038
I will think of
him as you die.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.272
You do the same.

33:34.579 --> 33:35.579
(shouting)
(horse neighs)

33:38.216 --> 33:40.150
(shouting)

33:40.752 --> 33:41.685
(horse neighs)

33:43.321 --> 33:45.188
On my signal,

33:45.190 --> 33:47.624
Spur your horses!

33:47.626 --> 33:49.760
No, stop! Riders, dismount.

33:49.762 --> 33:52.462
Rein in
your horses. Now.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.532
Even a queen needs grounds.
Unbind him.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.601
(whimpering)

33:57.603 --> 33:59.336
There will be
no execution today.

33:59.338 --> 34:02.072
You have just lost France
for you and your king.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.573
When the nobles hear of this...
I found

34:03.575 --> 34:04.775
Lord voland's confession.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.576
Handwritten before his death.

34:06.578 --> 34:09.112
What are you talking about?
He wrote it all down:

34:09.114 --> 34:12.449
How you both stole
from the vatican

34:12.451 --> 34:15.485
And then murdered the cardinal
before he could inform on you.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.354
Voland's remorse
that followed,

34:17.356 --> 34:19.623
His need to clear
his accounts with god,

34:19.625 --> 34:22.159
And his fear that you would
silence him before he could.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.360
His confession

34:23.362 --> 34:25.362
Is in the hands of a messenger

34:25.364 --> 34:28.432
Headed to your friends
in rome as we speak

34:28.434 --> 34:32.069
To reassure the vatican
that no life, especially one

34:32.071 --> 34:35.205
Of their own,
can be taken with impunity.

34:36.541 --> 34:37.741
Mary.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.277
I will handle this.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.578
But I have proof.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.146
Not anymore.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.648
My letters.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.183
You intercepted my riders. Why?

34:46.185 --> 34:47.818
You don't have to bow to him.
Mary,

34:47.820 --> 34:50.454
Leave us.
You, too, conde.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.656
I am your queen.
You owe me an explanation.

34:52.658 --> 34:55.192
You owe France
and your subjects a just rule.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.726
Go to our chambers,

34:56.728 --> 34:58.495
Where private discussions
between husbands and wives

34:58.497 --> 35:00.831
Should take place.

35:00.833 --> 35:02.099
I am not just your wife.

35:02.101 --> 35:04.534
You are not king
either.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.369
Leave us now.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.441
I always
thought

35:11.443 --> 35:13.310
You should have married
a common girl,

35:13.312 --> 35:14.678
Like your father.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.379
Rich, of course,

35:16.381 --> 35:17.647
But without a title
she felt obligated

35:17.649 --> 35:19.382
To club people with.

35:19.384 --> 35:22.419
I don't like you.
I don't care. You need me.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.121
I'm glad that
you've realized that.

35:27.391 --> 35:29.526
Lord voland's seal.
I stopped
the riders

35:29.528 --> 35:31.862
Because I understand
that we need each other.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.563
Nostradamus is a favorite
of my mother's,

35:33.565 --> 35:35.699
And none of these men
really caused your son's death.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.702
You will free them
as a favor to me.
That might

35:38.704 --> 35:40.837
Be difficult
to explain to the nobles.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.839
You riled them into a frenzy
on your behalf.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.441
Now tell them
you are satisfied.

35:44.443 --> 35:47.444
Manage them,
and I will manage my wife.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.446
There will need to be
some satisfaction,

35:49.448 --> 35:51.681
If you want all of this
to go away.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.316
No more bloodshed.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.484
Land.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.786
Of my choosing.

36:04.262 --> 36:06.630
(bell tolling in distance)

36:10.568 --> 36:14.638
Nostradamus and the guards
have been freed.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.808
You were brilliant.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.745
And he didn't ask to see
the contents of the letters?

36:21.747 --> 36:24.548
I burned them before
he could see they were forged.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.751
We have narcisse
at bay, but...

36:27.753 --> 36:29.686
Well, what is it?
What's wrong?

36:29.688 --> 36:33.390
I had to give him
something else as well.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.392
(horse neighs)

36:44.335 --> 36:46.703
This is very fine land.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.706
Who are you?
It's a rare parcel.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.442
Undamaged by fire.
Still producing.

36:52.444 --> 36:56.913
And all that separates
two larger parcels of mine.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.649
The king has deeded
this land to me.

36:59.651 --> 37:02.652
That's impossible.
Why would he take it away?

37:02.654 --> 37:04.254
Ask king francis yourself.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.456
He's requested your
presence at court.

37:06.458 --> 37:09.326
At court?

37:09.328 --> 37:10.927
But I can't go there.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.730
You can. And you will.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.801
I don't know
what's changed your mind.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.803
You were right before;

37:19.805 --> 37:21.805
A politician
is a liar's job.

37:21.807 --> 37:25.242
Even today I had to betray
a friend to save lives.
Well,

37:25.244 --> 37:28.245
This job is different.
Enforcing the laws,

37:28.247 --> 37:30.547
Keeping the peace beyond the
castle walls. My wife tells me

37:30.549 --> 37:32.415
That in scotland they call this

37:32.417 --> 37:34.251
The king's deputy.
Ah.

37:34.253 --> 37:36.286
The realm is growing unstable.

37:36.288 --> 37:39.289
You need someone out there
you can actually trust.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.491
Why are you kneeling?

37:41.493 --> 37:43.493
You're the king,
and I'm nothing.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.829
Until you make me something.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.697
Don't say that.
You're my brother.
Then give me

37:47.699 --> 37:49.699
The job already.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.702
Do it up properly. Use my sword.

37:54.538 --> 37:57.774
Very well.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.844
Sebastian, I hereby
appoint you

38:00.846 --> 38:02.846
The king's
deputy,

38:02.848 --> 38:05.782
With all rights
and apportionments so accruing.

38:08.719 --> 38:11.321
Nostradamus, you're
too injured to ride.
I have to.

38:11.323 --> 38:12.856
What will you tell catherine?

38:12.858 --> 38:14.524
That you had
another vision.

38:14.526 --> 38:15.725
Of a better life.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.328
God willing.

38:29.340 --> 38:31.541
(baby gurgles)
mary?

38:31.543 --> 38:33.476
Why did you ask me
to the nursery?

38:33.478 --> 38:35.478
Your father

38:35.480 --> 38:40.650
Was king henry ii
of the house of valois.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.019
You are francis ii,
the king of France.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.523
I'm mary stuart,
queen of scots.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.358
Whatever happens to us
while we live

38:48.360 --> 38:51.494
And when we are long gone,
nothing can change that

38:51.496 --> 38:53.496
Or take
it away.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.632
I don't understand.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.834
The world is a cruel place.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.904
And it's cruelest to the weak.

39:00.906 --> 39:05.008
They are bullied and sacrificed,

39:05.010 --> 39:08.011
Mocked and murdered
and they die in agony.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.946
Mary, why are you talking...

39:09.948 --> 39:11.715
Give him your name.

39:13.751 --> 39:16.052
Give your baby your name.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.490
Not even my name
can make him safe.

39:20.492 --> 39:24.494
No, but it can make him safer.

39:25.429 --> 39:26.830
Mary...
If you think

39:26.832 --> 39:28.898
I don't know the risks, I do.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.633
But if I don't want to
end up like catherine,

39:30.635 --> 39:31.835
I can't push
this child away

39:31.837 --> 39:34.104
Like she did with bash.

39:34.106 --> 39:37.907
I have to open my heart.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.909
So...

39:40.845 --> 39:43.847
...Do right by him,

39:43.849 --> 39:45.382
With my blessing,

39:45.384 --> 39:47.817
And claim him
as your own.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.387
And our marriage
will be stronger for it.

40:00.698 --> 40:03.066
(baby gurgling)

40:19.717 --> 40:22.719
(door opens)

40:22.721 --> 40:25.588
I'm never sure that
I'm holding him right.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.725
Oh, I could show you.

40:28.727 --> 40:31.594
Support his head,

40:31.596 --> 40:33.963
Like so.

40:36.133 --> 40:38.735
See?

40:44.975 --> 40:47.177
I remember holding you
in my arms

40:47.179 --> 40:50.180
When you were this little.

40:50.182 --> 40:53.049
I beg your pardon?

40:53.051 --> 40:54.918
When I gave you life,

40:54.920 --> 40:58.154
I thought it was the greatest
thing I'd ever done.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.056
All the treaties I'd made,

41:00.058 --> 41:03.026
All the wars and the whores
were nothing

41:03.028 --> 41:04.994
Compared to that.

41:04.996 --> 41:08.865
Who are you talking to?

41:08.867 --> 41:13.102
Don't you recognize
your own father?

41:14.071 --> 41:16.873
Usurper.

41:20.878 --> 41:23.079
(gasps)

41:23.081 --> 41:25.114
What did you just say?

41:26.083 --> 41:28.618
Did I say something, your grace?

41:29.620 --> 41:31.688
You don't remember?

41:31.690 --> 41:34.491
(baby crying)
remember what?
