01:08.769 --> 01:10.335
Embry! Get over here.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.475
Keep that crowd back.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.544
I don't want them to interfere.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.612
I want Boem out of there and
I want him out of there alive.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.614
Got it?

01:25.286 --> 01:28.387
Alright boys, you
made your point.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.490
Rayford comes out, we'll talk.

01:32.626 --> 01:36.295
We can't go home in
this, not after this.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.401
When they called out
Rayford like they done.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.269
What about our families?

01:44.271 --> 01:45.504
No! No!

01:45.506 --> 01:49.675
What they is failing
to recognize is,

01:49.677 --> 01:52.244
we got nothing left to sit for.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.546
Bullshit!

01:54.548 --> 01:55.814
Not cameras.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.684
That stupid pilot
light was yellow...

02:02.456 --> 02:03.456
Hey!

02:04.492 --> 02:06.291
And now they want
us to turn on you.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.895
Time I suggest move along.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.499
Rayford!

02:13.501 --> 02:14.666
Think they'll let us walk?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.248
Ray!

02:33.621 --> 02:35.420
Ray, whichever way this goes.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.724
There's something
I need you to know.

02:42.730 --> 02:46.165
Them years when we used
to wander the creeks...

02:46.834 --> 02:48.700
Pick up your rifles.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.335
Here we go.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.337
Let's go.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.605
My children.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.810
Why didn't you change?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.579
This shirt's so dirty.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.713
I wasn't thinking about it.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.848
I'm sorry.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.334
It's okay, I
should have told you.

04:45.335 --> 04:47.819
Let us all bow our heads and
recognize this pivotal hour

04:47.821 --> 04:50.856
that is upon us one final time.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.327
Dear heavenly Father we
come before you today

04:55.329 --> 04:56.762
to ask forgiveness.

04:58.032 --> 05:02.301
In these coming times
we seek your protection.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.872
It is no secret this
great reckoning.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.390
Your word says...

05:08.391 --> 05:09.907
Sorry to interrupt Pastor.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.648
Sheriff wishes
to address us this morning.

05:19.553 --> 05:24.623
I have decided

05:25.092 --> 05:26.491
that we should have

05:26.493 --> 05:28.026
a town council
meeting right now.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.798
The mill has burnt
to the ground.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.601
And there are no other
employment opportunities

05:36.603 --> 05:37.969
in this area.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.907
I worked at that
mill for 15 years.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.809
Wake up, it's gone.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.914
Your office told me to get
a new job next town over.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.717
Is Prattle shutting down?

05:51.719 --> 05:52.884
Yes, Prattle is shutting down.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.486
We couldn't save the mill...

05:54.488 --> 05:55.821
Distract us from
something we already know

05:55.823 --> 05:57.923
to justify killing those men.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.925
We could not save that mill.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.126
You know, sheriff,
it seems to me

06:01.128 --> 06:03.028
you already have
all the answers.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.130
Can't you let us grieve?

06:05.132 --> 06:08.533
Those people, they were
our brothers, our husbands.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.801
Your men...

06:09.803 --> 06:11.136
My men took action ma'am.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.070
You need to go to the truck.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.071
What is she talking about?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.506
You don't need to hear this.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.741
Come on, you need
to go to the truck.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.642
Is that that fire
was set intentionally.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.911
And those people, those
brothers and husbands

06:19.913 --> 06:23.849
that you speak of, they
sided with the perpetrator.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.518
And then they violently
attacked my men.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.019
Those deputies done us a favor.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.690
I heard it was Rayford Boem
who organized that crew.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.958
His whole life

06:32.960 --> 06:34.443
causing nothing but trouble.
Let's go.

06:34.444 --> 06:36.564
- All round these parts.
- I'll meet you at the truck.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.441
Ivory, Ivory please,
I didn't plan this.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.743
- I can't, I can't.
- Ivory!

08:10.023 --> 08:11.122
Hey Rea!

08:12.759 --> 08:15.627
You shouldn't take that.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.128
It's just food.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.082
Should we say something?

08:39.285 --> 08:40.986
People died here.

08:44.858 --> 08:45.858
Coming?

08:58.005 --> 09:00.071
It is official.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.174
Following the fire,
the old Prattle Mill

09:03.176 --> 09:06.044
will not be salvaged.

09:06.046 --> 09:10.982
With more than two-thirds of
the county now unemployed.

09:10.984 --> 09:15.554
Sheriff Pascal urges you
all to report any sightings

09:15.556 --> 09:19.124
of the man accused, to
his office, as the hunt

09:19.126 --> 09:21.893
for Rayford Boem, presses on.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.063
All of this, leaving
many to question,

09:25.065 --> 09:28.567
what will become
of our little town.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.201
The sheriff of course,

09:30.203 --> 09:32.837
issuing his address
this morning in...

09:34.074 --> 09:37.042
¶ I must've been born ¶

09:38.111 --> 09:39.978
¶ Stayin my hand ¶

09:39.980 --> 09:40.980
Reagan please!

09:42.983 --> 09:44.149
Can I ask you something?

09:45.852 --> 09:47.118
Everyone's saying Pa's dead.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.295
Will he come back?

10:02.302 --> 10:03.735
I don't know.

10:05.772 --> 10:06.772
You don't care.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.241
You don't want him,
you let him go.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.299
Here we go.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.800
Come on.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.168
Okay, how about you guys
play keep away from me.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.203
Okay.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.237
I'll try to get it.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.279
Okay, let's try to get it.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.108
But we have to stay close.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.313
Takes a real man to
wear that jacket.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.193
You want to hear
the second verse?

11:02.195 --> 11:03.195
I bet you never heard it.

11:04.398 --> 11:08.066
¶ As I was walking ¶

11:08.068 --> 11:12.237
¶ Through the redwood forest ¶

11:12.239 --> 11:16.274
¶ I saw above me an open sky ¶

12:06.293 --> 12:07.726
Did you eat?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.209
You could've kept
him here, but you yell.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.443
I yell!

12:25.445 --> 12:27.378
- You yell and...
- Bullshit Reagan!

12:46.333 --> 12:47.333
Bad time?

12:57.210 --> 13:00.545
I'm just gonna come right
out and say it Ivory Joy.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.347
Rayford led those men
in that millstrike

13:02.349 --> 13:03.548
yesterday morning.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.283
Of the bodies,
his weren't found.

13:06.853 --> 13:09.454
Just the rifle,
registered to his name.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.991
No other clues.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.092
Just the mess.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.128
And you want me to turn him in?

13:19.032 --> 13:20.198
Them boys.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.233
What's your plan for them?

13:22.235 --> 13:24.202
You leave them alone Sheriff!

13:24.204 --> 13:27.872
I done about all
I can do, Ivory Joy.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.340
What do you want me to do?

13:29.342 --> 13:32.377
Just turn my back and pretend
none of this is happening?

13:32.379 --> 13:34.345
This ain't our fault.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.347
Rayford set that fire.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.053
When you come back here,
what was your plan?

13:43.390 --> 13:45.470
You come back to Prattle
just to watch it set alight?

13:47.060 --> 13:48.326
That ain't nothing familiar.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.167
When I catch him, I'm
gonna have to put him down.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.606
I won't be a part of that.

14:01.608 --> 14:05.376
You just remember, Rayford
chose to do what he done.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.279
He left you raw, not me.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.300
Can you cut it
out with that thing.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.434
Ray!

15:03.436 --> 15:04.516
Not doing anything wrong.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.015
You don't even play no good.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.416
Dinner's not ready,
go in the other room.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.618
Not going in the other room,
you go in the other room.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.626
I'm gonna need you
to go to the store.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.195
Get some meat, it's burnt.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.331
Reagan!

15:33.333 --> 15:35.466
What! Why me?

15:36.303 --> 15:37.535
Do you want to eat tonight?

15:37.537 --> 15:38.469
No.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.271
Good you get to do it anyway.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.215
You mind taking
Reagan to the store?

15:52.052 --> 15:53.184
Yeah we're fine.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.465
This whole out of town
things pretty scary.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.137
You ever need to talk.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.478
Your mom says you're working
a job now, is that true?

16:21.381 --> 16:24.349
Was, stupid anyways.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.150
Swept floors.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.685
Job's a job.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.488
Good as any other job if
you take a lesson from it.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.589
Sweeping floors?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.493
Maybe not that job.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.696
Did I ever tell you that time

16:38.698 --> 16:40.631
that we almost went
on a camping trip?

16:43.103 --> 16:44.402
Your mother and I
we'd known each other

16:44.404 --> 16:45.536
since we were your age.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.540
We had it all planned out.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.509
Week in the country.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.643
You were still young.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.447
Your dad was still
off playing his music.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.318
Liked daisies your mother.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.699
What you got there?

17:17.737 --> 17:19.503
Come on, I'll buy.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.724
I don't know what
I'm doing Hank.

18:31.845 --> 18:34.512
Sheriff keeps pressing
us like we're hiding him.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.415
I can't even keep him here.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.788
You know I'd never do
anything to hurt you Ivory Joy.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.699
Sometimes, I find myself
wishing he was dead.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.171
How much easier would it be?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.683
You've always been
a good friend Hank.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.167
Sheriff came by today.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.579
Told Ma to clear
out in a few days.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.320
Where we gonna go?

19:49.322 --> 19:50.488
I don't know Neely.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.666
Hey Ray.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.869
When we were back
at the station.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.739
Should we have said something?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.276
Dad ain't dead Neely.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.496
Hey Carl.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.732
Can I get two packs of
Reds, put it on my tab.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.866
Out.

20:35.868 --> 20:36.834
Pardon?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.669
Shuttin' down tomorrow.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.905
Where am I supposed
to get my cigarettes?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.014
Hi Jean.

20:49.882 --> 20:50.882
Hey Ivory Joy.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.322
Come on, let's go to the truck.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.023
Give you more, but
it's all I got.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.724
No, it's fine.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.726
Thanks.

21:45.872 --> 21:46.872
So the kids have grown.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.407
How old are they now?

21:51.044 --> 21:52.044
14.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.313
Well you're a lady.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.616
Call me what you want.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.657
I'm sorry for your loss.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.462
You know Rayford, he liked
Hudson, he liked him well.

22:12.699 --> 22:13.699
It's okay.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.503
Hud would've followed
Rayford off a cliff

22:19.505 --> 22:21.539
if he asked him to,
I always knew that.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.909
Just never thought
he'd actually be gone.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.881
And you get yourself, you
know tricking yourself

22:30.883 --> 22:32.817
into that perfect life.

22:32.819 --> 22:33.819
You know?

22:39.092 --> 22:40.491
Where you all headed?

22:42.595 --> 22:44.628
Hud has a sister,
Mayford County.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.432
That old gal hasn't
spoken to me in years.

22:49.836 --> 22:53.537
But, those tend to be the ones
that smother you with lovin'

22:53.539 --> 22:54.972
when you get to the door.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.452
You take care Ivory Joy.

23:10.656 --> 23:12.123
You take care of them boys okay.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.962
You tell 'em I say goodbye okay.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.532
I will.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.669
Maybe we'll see each
other down that road.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.473
Well hell, it's the
only road left ain't it.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.725
Promise me something..

24:24.230 --> 24:26.197
I need you to cover for me.

24:26.199 --> 24:27.765
Mom can't know.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.649
Try it again.

25:41.007 --> 25:45.175
¶ Probably going to die ¶

26:05.998 --> 26:07.231
Hey I was thinking.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.735
What do you say we all
go do something fun

26:11.737 --> 26:13.003
before we have to leave.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.206
Yeah.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.610
Yeah?

26:20.313 --> 26:21.313
Yeah.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.250
Where's your brother?

26:30.723 --> 26:31.723
Neely.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.226
Where's your brother?

27:14.100 --> 27:15.833
I'll be right there.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.068
Sorry it's so late.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.837
You have cigarettes?

27:19.839 --> 27:22.072
I'll take two packs of Reds.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.074
Thanks.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.055
Got our names put in?

27:38.057 --> 27:39.356
Yeah.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.960
You're first.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.250
Ray.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.458
Ray.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.328
Shhhh.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.197
Shhhh.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.444
Soon as that cross that creek.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.345
You're gonna help
us get out of here.

28:38.918 --> 28:39.918
Shhhh.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.325
Good? Good?

28:49.128 --> 28:50.294
Stand up son.

28:52.732 --> 28:56.066
Let's go, come on
let's go pick him up.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.240
Put him under his arm,
he's hurt real bad.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.176
Get him up, get him up.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.211
Not my son.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.278
Stand up.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.280
Not my son.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.762
You shouldn't have come here.

29:24.764 --> 29:25.764
Needed to know.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.899
You're a damn fool
just like your mother.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.137
I need you to get
in the damn truck.

29:41.847 --> 29:43.914
The side door, hand it to me.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.518
We need to go the hospital.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.986
We ain't going to
no damn hospital.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.320
They'll pick us up when
we get through the door.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.556
We're going home boy,
we're going home.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.293
Our food ran out two days ago.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.896
Help me get this buckle.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.264
Help me buckle in.

30:02.535 --> 30:04.568
We're going home, take me home!

30:12.011 --> 30:13.310
Give it gas!

30:13.312 --> 30:15.112
Give it gas!

30:17.383 --> 30:19.817
Son you're gonna flood it.

30:20.953 --> 30:24.121
Goddamn it, do you
know how to drive?

30:47.313 --> 30:48.313
Thanks.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.219
You have a good time?

30:56.255 --> 30:57.255
Yeah.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.390
Go on.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.227
Where were you?

32:18.604 --> 32:20.103
Where were you?

32:23.208 --> 32:26.009
Walk away, just
like your father.

32:27.079 --> 32:30.547
Well at least he
was able to walk away.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.538
Who else is up?

34:01.173 --> 34:02.173
No one, just me.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.076
I brought water.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.214
You gonna help me
get him inside.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.216
What about mom?

34:13.819 --> 34:15.185
I messed some things around,

34:15.187 --> 34:16.485
took some food from the kitchen.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.754
She meant to go to the
store and get more.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.056
When she does, we're
gonna make our move.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.731
Go on back to bed.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.722
Moved a few things.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.625
Hello?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.160
You all know what time it is?

35:31.563 --> 35:32.563
Hello?

35:37.669 --> 35:38.669
Shit!

35:39.571 --> 35:40.670
Neely!

35:43.909 --> 35:45.609
Neely, get up.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.777
Fraid they left the door
open now the food's gone.

35:48.614 --> 35:49.579
What?

35:49.581 --> 35:50.614
You can clean the mess.

35:50.616 --> 35:51.681
Come on.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.484
Come on, come on!

35:55.287 --> 35:56.553
Probably the Clunes,

35:56.555 --> 35:58.622
always stealing other
people's property.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.624
Can't afford to buy
their own things.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.868
Reagan, where's
that wheelchair at,

36:11.870 --> 36:13.637
from when you broke your
foot a few years back.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.372
We got rid of it.

36:15.374 --> 36:18.308
Okay, then grab his other
arm, we gonna get him inside.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.795
Everyone says they'll
be making us leave soon.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.970
Remember when we went to
Mr. Taylor's pool parties

36:46.972 --> 36:48.438
when you all was little.

36:50.275 --> 36:51.675
And he had that dog.

36:51.677 --> 36:54.244
He was a black lab,

36:54.246 --> 36:56.680
but his tail was yellow. Yellow.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.418
And he walked with a hitch.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.686
Wily old thing.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.752
Can't believe all the
stores in town are closed.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.401
I'm starving.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.656
Neely go inside.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.324
Go inside.

38:14.326 --> 38:15.859
Go inside!

39:01.039 --> 39:03.673
They're all avoiding
me like it's contagious.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.577
Rick, they never
really knew you.

39:10.082 --> 39:13.883
They never knew
you, not like I did.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.088
Do you know...

39:21.426 --> 39:23.760
I can't save you right?

39:23.762 --> 39:25.095
Yeah, I know.

39:31.536 --> 39:32.736
You never really could.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.913
Remember we used to wander
that creek when we were kids.

39:46.818 --> 39:49.853
Such a beautiful place.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.426
One day you pushed
me in those rocks

39:56.428 --> 39:59.462
and you watched
me start to drown.

39:59.464 --> 40:03.099
But wait, I know
you remember that.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.574
For years I wanted to kill you.

40:13.612 --> 40:14.878
I hated you after that.

40:21.520 --> 40:25.922
I just, you know, you should
have been there for me

40:26.925 --> 40:28.792
as my big brother.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.493
And I just, I needed that.

40:32.898 --> 40:33.963
Not like you.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.936
Then you left and played
music for people all over,

40:41.206 --> 40:42.505
singing about home.

40:45.544 --> 40:49.679
Every day you were gone a
little piece of the hate died.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.018
I just need you to know that.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.562
Get him some water.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.508
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

41:21.012 --> 41:21.978
Reagan!

41:21.980 --> 41:22.946
You pour that out right now.

41:22.948 --> 41:23.913
Do what she says.

41:23.915 --> 41:24.948
Just shut up.

41:24.950 --> 41:25.782
He's a criminal.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.851
He's dad's brother.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.152
He abandoned us too.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.669
Started at the mill
just a few months ago,

41:46.671 --> 41:48.104
just before all this went down.

41:50.509 --> 41:51.674
Why'd you come back?

41:53.845 --> 41:54.677
Why do you want
to ask him that...

41:54.679 --> 41:55.979
No you be quiet.

41:55.981 --> 41:56.946
- You just asked me...
- You don't need to speak.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.181
You just asked me a question.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.649
I changed my mind.

41:59.651 --> 42:00.817
You change your
mind too damn much.

42:00.819 --> 42:01.918
I said shut up.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.121
Get me a blanket.

42:05.123 --> 42:06.055
He can't stay
here Ray, he can't.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.090
Get me a blanket.

42:07.092 --> 42:08.057
No, Reagan.

42:08.059 --> 42:09.259
No Reagan!

42:10.862 --> 42:12.128
He can't stay.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.932
Ray, he can't stay here.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.200
Where do you want
him to go Ivory?

42:17.202 --> 42:18.668
Where do you want him to go?

42:18.670 --> 42:19.936
He can't stay here.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.818
He's gonna stay here,
we're staying the night.

42:24.609 --> 42:26.643
We're staying the night.

42:26.645 --> 42:28.111
What about the deputies.

42:28.113 --> 42:30.113
Don't worry about the deputies,
I'll take care of that.

42:30.115 --> 42:32.015
Everything's going to
be just fine, alright.

42:32.017 --> 42:35.084
I'm back, I ain't never
gonna leave you all again.

42:36.588 --> 42:38.221
Everything's going
to be just fine.

42:44.996 --> 42:46.563
Give me the blanket Ivory Joy.

43:27.005 --> 43:30.239
You can sit down,
I ain't an animal.

43:34.079 --> 43:35.144
You got a girlfriend.

43:36.815 --> 43:41.117
Go blind or something.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.186
You got girls don't you?

43:44.189 --> 43:45.622
You got girls?

43:47.892 --> 43:48.825
How about your brother?

43:48.827 --> 43:50.193
Did you start that fire?

43:52.364 --> 43:53.364
Did you?

43:55.700 --> 43:57.767
Did you start that fire?

45:21.920 --> 45:23.386
You ought to not
play with a pick.

45:24.456 --> 45:26.122
Not the way I learnt anyway.

45:38.403 --> 45:39.769
Play something for me.

45:48.113 --> 45:50.146
Go on, get them
sirens out of my head.

45:56.454 --> 45:57.787
There you go.

46:00.258 --> 46:01.324
Hold them strings down.

46:05.296 --> 46:06.362
Took me a long time too.

46:10.368 --> 46:11.368
Let's see it.

46:27.886 --> 46:29.452
You know when you
was a little boy,

46:31.022 --> 46:32.321
I's on the road all the time.

46:34.225 --> 46:36.192
Your mother used to call
me up at night and say,

46:36.194 --> 46:40.797
Rayford, I can't get these
boys to bed for nothing.

46:42.433 --> 46:47.503
She'd say, Reagan's went
and hid under the bed.

46:51.109 --> 46:52.575
He just want to hear you sing.

46:54.846 --> 46:57.113
So I used to call
up every night.

46:58.316 --> 47:00.216
Have to play you this lullaby.

47:02.921 --> 47:06.255
¶ Say listen little fella ¶

47:06.257 --> 47:09.525
¶ There's no reason to hide ¶

47:09.527 --> 47:12.228
¶ I'll hold you in my arms ¶

47:12.230 --> 47:15.264
¶ Carry you through the night ¶

47:15.266 --> 47:19.202
¶ Be your shield ¶

47:19.204 --> 47:22.238
¶ If bad guys come ¶

47:22.240 --> 47:24.974
¶ If a thundercloud claps ¶

47:24.976 --> 47:28.578
¶ If a big tree falls ¶

47:28.580 --> 47:31.447
¶ So listen little fella ¶

47:31.449 --> 47:35.084
¶ There's no reason to fear ¶

47:35.086 --> 47:37.253
¶ I hold you in my arms ¶

47:37.255 --> 47:41.390
¶ Whisper in your ear ¶

47:41.392 --> 47:44.327
¶ Be your shield ¶

47:44.329 --> 47:47.363
¶ Forgot the words ¶

47:47.365 --> 47:52.435
¶ Living on the road
somewhere in Tennessee ¶

47:53.304 --> 47:56.205
¶ So listen little fella ¶

47:56.207 --> 47:59.375
¶ When your momma tells you ¶

47:59.377 --> 48:02.378
¶ To finish all your supper ¶

48:02.380 --> 48:05.047
¶ Tie your shoe ¶

48:05.049 --> 48:08.284
¶ Cause I'd give a million
dollars to hear you ¶

48:08.286 --> 48:10.920
¶ Say that to me ¶

48:10.922 --> 48:13.122
¶ I've been living on the road ¶

48:13.124 --> 48:16.926
¶ Somewhere in Tennessee ¶

48:16.928 --> 48:19.528
¶ So listen little fella ¶

48:19.530 --> 48:22.365
¶ To your daddy's song ¶

48:22.367 --> 48:25.468
¶ Help your momma
wash the dishes ¶

48:25.470 --> 48:29.272
¶ Don't do your brother wrong ¶

48:29.274 --> 48:32.074
¶ Got to fall asleep ¶

48:32.076 --> 48:35.278
¶ Before I count to five ¶

48:35.280 --> 48:38.014
¶ One, two, three, four ¶

48:46.391 --> 48:47.307
Goodnight little fella.

48:47.308 --> 48:48.224
And your mom would pick
the phone back up and say,

48:48.226 --> 48:51.661
Rayford, I don't
know how you do it.

48:53.431 --> 48:57.066
Both of them boys
are sound asleep.

49:06.177 --> 49:07.977
Turned out to be
my first hit song.

49:30.368 --> 49:31.567
Do you think he knows,

49:34.706 --> 49:38.107
that he's gonna die?

49:42.013 --> 49:44.046
He's probably known
that a long time.

49:47.218 --> 49:50.052
What happened to them?

49:50.054 --> 49:51.120
Dad and him.

49:59.063 --> 50:00.129
I think...

50:02.667 --> 50:07.737
I think he was the first
person to shoot.

50:12.443 --> 50:15.244
Do you ever feel like
we're just being played with?

50:18.649 --> 50:21.751
Like someone else out there
is doing all this to us.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.254
You don't have to whisper boys.

50:30.361 --> 50:31.660
I'm wondering the same thing.

50:38.770 --> 50:40.202
Go to sleep.

50:50.081 --> 50:51.081
Neely.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.285
I taught you how to ride too.

51:01.492 --> 51:03.259
You'll be alright.

51:25.616 --> 51:27.149
Good morning.

51:42.166 --> 51:43.299
Shhh, shhh.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.337
He died real peaceful.

51:49.507 --> 51:50.706
Alright.

51:50.708 --> 51:51.708
Alright.

54:00.705 --> 54:01.937
You took our sons.

54:03.241 --> 54:04.974
You took our sons
to bury their uncle.

54:06.711 --> 54:07.743
What's wrong with you?

54:09.347 --> 54:10.512
What's wrong with you?

54:13.751 --> 54:15.417
How could you?

54:15.419 --> 54:16.652
How could you!

54:17.822 --> 54:19.355
Stop, stop, stop.

54:24.762 --> 54:25.762
Shhh, shhh!

55:12.877 --> 55:13.877
I can't do this Ray.

55:21.752 --> 55:26.021
Can't, I can't pretend
everything's gonna be fine.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.355
Do me a favor,
take his shoes off.

56:13.537 --> 56:17.473
First night we brought Neely
home, you did the same thing.

56:19.910 --> 56:23.779
I tried to get him out the
clothes the hospital gave him.

56:23.781 --> 56:25.714
Put him in your old clothes.

56:28.786 --> 56:30.686
God, you were so jealous.

56:31.889 --> 56:34.556
Stormed out of the
room stomping around.

56:37.027 --> 56:39.928
You were the baddest two-year
old I have ever seen.

56:41.799 --> 56:42.898
I called you back in.

56:46.604 --> 56:49.571
Asked you to help me
put on his onesie.

56:53.010 --> 56:57.646
You sat right there,
all teary-eyed,

56:59.583 --> 57:00.949
trying to prove a point.

57:05.556 --> 57:09.024
Your father, he has music.

57:12.930 --> 57:18.000
First song he ever
wrote, it was for you.

57:19.804 --> 57:21.103
Quiet little song.

57:25.609 --> 57:29.945
¶ Listen little fella ¶

57:29.947 --> 57:34.850
¶ There's no reason to hide ¶

57:34.852 --> 57:38.654
¶ I'll hold you nearby ¶

57:38.656 --> 57:43.725
¶ I'll carry you
through the night ¶

57:46.964 --> 57:51.733
¶ I'll hold you nearby ¶

57:51.735 --> 57:55.971
¶ And carry you
through the night ¶

58:01.078 --> 58:02.078
Howdy Hank.

58:05.950 --> 58:08.484
Storms was coming.

58:08.486 --> 58:10.185
You were so terrified.

58:28.239 --> 58:30.239
Could you go get
me a nine 16 wrench.

58:36.080 --> 58:38.547
Come on down here and
tighten this thing up.

58:41.919 --> 58:43.719
Your momma tells me you're
out here most mornings

58:43.721 --> 58:45.220
working on this thing.

58:47.892 --> 58:48.892
Yeah.

58:49.960 --> 58:51.927
Why you spend so
much time out here?

58:54.064 --> 58:58.066
I dunno.

58:58.068 --> 59:00.869
Cleaned about a damn pound
of gunk off this thing.

59:08.679 --> 59:10.012
Boy you don't talk too much.

59:14.285 --> 59:15.651
Not got much to say.

59:18.923 --> 59:21.590
You wanna know the real
reason I bought this bike?

59:23.627 --> 59:24.627
Yeah.

59:27.765 --> 59:28.997
I was hoping that
you and I could spend

59:28.999 --> 59:30.832
a lot of time out
here working on it.

59:36.173 --> 59:39.007
You all took off
before we had the chance.

59:55.793 --> 59:57.159
Wasn't sound asleep.

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:10.639
Relax, I just want to
pick a few things up.

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.124
Do you even want me anymore?

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.875
Funny, I was asked
by a man one time

01:01:36.876 --> 01:01:38.726
if living on the road
was gonna be my destiny.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:43.765
You know, nothing ahead,
no baggage left behind.

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:50.839
I know I got a bad temper baby,

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.441
but I never hurt
anybody in cold blood.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.215
There's always a reason.

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:02.185
Rayford.

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:07.122
What did you do?

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.899
There was a man come by today.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:24.306
Carrying flowers,
a bag of groceries.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:25.841
Hank.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:27.562
I beat him to where
he knew he'd been hit.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:34.950
He was able to crawl
back to his truck but...

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:35.952
No.

01:02:44.528 --> 01:02:48.029
You go on up to
bed, I'll handle this.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:53.368
Rayford, show me your hands.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.770
Show me your hands.

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:56.104
Show me your hands.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.172
Do not move.

01:02:58.509 --> 01:02:59.775
Do not move.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.352
Get back in the house ma'am.

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:12.120
Get in the house.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:21.296
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:24.399
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:34.476
The only reason I'm not
taking you, is for those boys.

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:29.898
You can't keep hating me Reagan.

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:36.037
Stand where I'm standing.

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:43.445
If only he left.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:47.315
I asked if we never
have a chance,

01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:49.885
a chance to make things right.

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:57.993
All I wanted to do was
to go to sleep at night,

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:02.964
and when I woke up I'd
know that you'd be there,

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.501
and everything would be okay.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.952
I set your transfer
to Melbourne county.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.491
Pastor Phillips is recovering
in the hospital up north.

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:36.398
I remember the first time
I ever heard about you.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.033
You were living over in Dayton.

01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:42.304
Your song come on the radio
one evening and I said,

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:44.973
that's somebody
that sure can play.

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:48.109
And you could.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.477
You had that mean picking,

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:52.247
but you never lost the
breadth of the guitar.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.449
I never played with a pick.

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:58.153
Convention never was
your strong suit I guess.

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:03.024
But then one day, we look
at ourselves in the mirror

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:09.397
and we realize, the only thing
owed us, is what we put in.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:15.103
Sheriff if I was to
put out half the abuse

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:17.138
that was put into me I'd
have burnt this town down

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.406
a long time ago.

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:27.215
You know I come back here,
go to work up at the mill.

01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:32.554
I figure I got one more chance.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:38.493
Then that furnace blew,
mill caught on fire.

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:42.564
I go to bed, wake up, next
morning my face plastered

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:43.665
all over this town.

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:51.573
I made some mistakes, but you
controlled what happened next.

01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:55.343
Till that point, I was innocent.

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:59.381
You keep putting
yourself on a path

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:01.716
that puts you in my sights.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:06.021
Innocent's not the word I'd use.

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:08.523
We all on a path Sheriff.

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:14.529
But my wife, and boys.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:19.401
You ain't mad enough to
keep me from my family.

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:46.461
You fixed the bike.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.633
You always walk away.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.636
I don't know what to do.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:02.844
Would you quit messing with
that thing for one damn second.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:04.579
What the fuck do
you want me to say.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:07.449
That we tried and it's
the best we could do.

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:08.550
You never cared
in the first place!

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:10.151
I never cared!

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:12.621
Damn you.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.408
Now everyone's walking away.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.685
I'm hungry man!

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:46.254
What the hell are you doing.

01:08:58.535 --> 01:08:59.535
Aaargh.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.639
Screw it, open this cell.

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:08.143
I'm gonna walk
right through there.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.247
You want to die right
here, think about it.

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:37.865
I swore when you left this
time, I would leave you.

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:43.471
You've sworn before.

01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:52.347
You remember what you said
to me the first night we met?

01:10:56.486 --> 01:10:58.386
You been running
through my mind all night,

01:10:58.388 --> 01:10:59.621
so your feet must be tired.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:01.689
Come on.

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:04.292
You don't get to
do that this time.

01:11:04.294 --> 01:11:06.794
Something else spectacularly
charming or interesting.

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:09.397
This is not fair, come on.

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:12.000
You remember.

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:16.738
I've made so many
mistakes after.

01:11:25.582 --> 01:11:30.652
I told you from the start,
even if I couldn't see

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:36.891
you was always gonna be
the love that blinded me.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.497
Now we've seen too much.

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:48.889
¶ Listen little fella ¶

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:52.193

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:55.029

¶ If the bad guys come ¶

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:10.144

claps, if a big tree falls ¶

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:14.248
¶ So listen little fella ¶

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.518

¶ I'll hold you in my arms ¶

01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:23.858
¶ Whisper in your ear ¶

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.827
¶ Be your shield ¶

01:19:26.829 --> 01:19:29.897
¶ Forgot the words ¶

01:19:29.899 --> 01:19:34.969
¶ Living on the road
somewhere in Tennessee ¶

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.539
¶ So listen little fella ¶

01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:42.009
¶ When your momma tells you ¶

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:44.278
¶ To finish all your supper ¶

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.515
¶ And tie your shoe ¶

01:19:47.517 --> 01:19:50.284

million dollars ¶

¶ So listen little fella
to your daddy's song ¶

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:08.135
¶ Help your momma
wash the dishes ¶

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:11.872
¶ Don't do your brother wrong ¶

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:13.874
