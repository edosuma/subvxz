02:46.024 --> 02:47.628
<i>Perhaps you miss heard me</i>

02:47.658 --> 02:50.225
<i>I said Stark
Tower is under attack</i>

02:50.255 --> 02:51.497
<i>right now.</i>

02:51.700 --> 02:52.834
Is Iron Man there?

02:52.864 --> 02:55.302
<i>Yes, as are Thor and the Black Panther.</i>

02:55.332 --> 02:58.006
<i>- Who are they fighting?
- The Radioactive man.</i>

02:58.738 --> 03:00.739
Agh, can't they fight here? By the pool?

03:01.235 --> 03:02.508
What's the threat level?

03:02.538 --> 03:05.580
<i>- Threat level 2.
- I'm sure they got it covered, JARVIS.</i>

03:05.767 --> 03:07.904
Tell Stark that Jan and I
will cover the mansion.

03:07.934 --> 03:09.257
In case it's a trick.

03:09.876 --> 03:12.397
And mention that he is out of ice.

03:12.589 --> 03:13.589
<i>What?</i>

03:22.862 --> 03:25.688
Remind me to hurt Hawkeye
when we're done here. You ok?

03:25.718 --> 03:28.154
I will be better once we smite
this villain.

03:36.972 --> 03:37.972
Who is he?

03:40.319 --> 03:41.646
Radioactive man?

03:42.668 --> 03:44.924
He was a Chinese scientist
named Chen Lu.

03:44.954 --> 03:47.790
Apparently he dosed himself
with insane levels of radiation.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.604
Trying to get super powers.

03:49.634 --> 03:51.646
He was in the Cube when
the  breakout happened.

03:51.647 --> 03:52.647
Shield took him
down last time.

03:52.676 --> 03:55.816
Yet again you're mortal
science creates monsters.

03:55.846 --> 03:58.714
Truly, mans technology
cause nothing but harm.

03:58.744 --> 04:00.264
Wow, that's kind of harsh.

04:07.383 --> 04:09.715
I'm starting to think Wasp
and Hawkeye are the smart ones.

04:09.745 --> 04:12.037
I did not realize there
was any question.

04:12.564 --> 04:15.071
You ok? This guy is
putting out a ton of juice.

04:15.101 --> 04:17.814
My suit is designed to
with stand radiation.

04:17.844 --> 04:19.865
Of course it is, what
was I thinking?

04:22.621 --> 04:24.280
I have had enough villain.

04:24.399 --> 04:26.341
I do not know why
you have come here.

04:26.371 --> 04:28.127
And I do not care.

04:28.341 --> 04:31.057
For now you will feel
the power of Thor!

04:35.436 --> 04:37.193
Odin's beard! how?

04:38.503 --> 04:39.948
Yeah, focused radiation can

04:39.978 --> 04:42.438
Rip the inertia from
an object in motion.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.104
You should try more physics, less fantasy.

05:03.714 --> 05:05.017
That's why he came here.

05:05.047 --> 05:07.417
To the ARC reactor he is
absorbing the output.

05:07.780 --> 05:10.743
With that much energy he could
well be unstoppable.

05:14.101 --> 05:17.162
Ok, time to send Dr. Chen Lu here
back to China.

05:19.565 --> 05:20.802
What is Iron Man doing?

05:20.832 --> 05:23.082
He is creating a localized meltdown.

05:23.345 --> 05:27.473
It will sink the reactor and
Radioactive man deep into the earth.

05:31.251 --> 05:32.251
No.

05:33.243 --> 05:34.352
Thor, wait!

05:57.065 --> 05:59.304
Call off your hounds, Elf.

05:59.494 --> 06:02.212
Were you sent to check
on me, Enchantress?

06:02.448 --> 06:04.028
I am hurt...

06:04.308 --> 06:06.722
It is if Loki does
not trust me...

06:07.253 --> 06:09.442
Loki is no fool, Malekith.

06:09.639 --> 06:11.828
You're own people do not trust you.

06:12.056 --> 06:15.565
Or did not before their untimely demise.

06:16.095 --> 06:18.507
But you would be wise
to trust in his power

06:18.677 --> 06:19.733
and to fear it.

06:20.086 --> 06:22.536
For just as Loki released you
from the Realm of the dead.

06:22.537 --> 06:24.537
He can send you back.

06:24.646 --> 06:25.696
Show it to me.

06:25.998 --> 06:27.680
Of course, my lady.

06:28.117 --> 06:29.617
As requested

06:30.064 --> 06:32.400
The casket of ancient winters.

06:43.590 --> 06:44.738
But what am I thinking?

06:44.768 --> 06:49.520
Loki would be disappointed in me if
I did not make sure this was the true casket.

06:49.567 --> 06:50.822
No! Skurge!

06:57.876 --> 07:00.420
You were right not
to trust me, of course.

07:01.397 --> 07:03.704
Now it begins.

07:17.399 --> 07:18.983
I had it under control.

07:19.013 --> 07:22.713
And now there is a million gallons
of contaminated water in my basement.

07:22.743 --> 07:27.129
And you would have poisoned Midguard itself
by sending Radioactive Man into the ground.

07:27.159 --> 07:29.174
- What are you...
- You're love of science makes

07:29.204 --> 07:31.280
you forget the very
realm you are trying to protect.

07:31.634 --> 07:35.179
<i>You pay more head to your machines
then you heart, Tony Stark.</i>

07:35.209 --> 07:36.209
<i>I...</i>

07:37.916 --> 07:39.266
Thor, you ok?

07:39.569 --> 07:40.569
Nay.

07:40.709 --> 07:41.959
I felt...

07:42.156 --> 07:43.669
I felt magic.

07:44.027 --> 07:45.177
Ancient magic.

07:46.006 --> 07:47.320
Something has happened.

08:22.857 --> 08:23.857
Cold!

08:23.887 --> 08:24.896
Am I crazy?

08:24.926 --> 08:27.166
Or was it a hundred
degrees a minute ago?

08:27.433 --> 08:29.455
- Look on the bright side.
- Like?

08:31.299 --> 08:32.472
I got nothing.

08:32.503 --> 08:33.639
I hate the cold.

08:33.941 --> 08:36.071
We need to move the
team to the West Coast.

08:46.339 --> 08:48.640
- We should probably get dressed.
- Good thinking.

08:53.214 --> 08:54.758
<i>In all the nine realms.</i>

08:54.812 --> 08:57.587
Only one thing I know of
could cause this.

08:58.252 --> 09:00.187
The casket of ancient winters.

09:00.263 --> 09:01.898
Well, thanks for clearing that up.

09:01.928 --> 09:04.283
The casket is an ancient Asgardian artefact

09:04.313 --> 09:06.813
that contains the infinite cold of Nifelheim.

09:07.010 --> 09:08.989
The realm of the dishonoured dead.

09:09.356 --> 09:11.460
My father Odin hid it long ago.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.421
But only he knew where.

09:13.451 --> 09:15.241
Earth seems a likely location.

09:15.271 --> 09:17.144
You speak wisely, T'Challa.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.511
Midgard is beneath notice
to most Asgardians.

09:20.541 --> 09:24.488
This storm will rage for all eternity
unless we can find the casket

09:24.518 --> 09:25.538
and close it.

09:25.568 --> 09:28.287
Ok, so I may not
know what the heck "magic" is

09:28.607 --> 09:30.583
But I learned to trace its signature.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.439
Except for instance when the entire
planet is covered in it.

09:33.469 --> 09:35.083
So, this is your thing.

09:35.113 --> 09:36.853
- How do we find it?
- I...

09:36.883 --> 09:37.883
do not know.

09:38.397 --> 09:41.071
Legend tells that only
the dead could find it.

09:41.253 --> 09:42.441
Oh, that's just great.

09:42.471 --> 09:46.518
JARVIS, display all weather
satellite data for the last hour.

09:46.813 --> 09:49.734
I already looked, T'Challa, there's
no pattern. And you, Thor...

09:49.764 --> 09:52.793
You always complain about technology
and science creating monsters,

09:52.823 --> 09:56.303
and now some magic box from
imagination land has frozen the planet.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.644
Do you really wish to take this path?

09:58.674 --> 10:01.943
How many times have we
faced danger created in a lab?

10:02.103 --> 10:04.697
I don't know. But I remember your little
blond, Enchantress,

10:04.727 --> 10:06.816
taking down the whole team, twice.

10:06.846 --> 10:09.066
And who was the guy with the axe?
another Asgardian?

10:09.096 --> 10:10.882
Oh, right! I remember now.

10:10.912 --> 10:12.222
He was going to chop of my head!

10:12.252 --> 10:14.400
Amora and Skurge will be dealt with.

10:14.430 --> 10:16.596
Oh, so you are on a first
name basis with them.

10:16.626 --> 10:18.602
Nice. You should form
your own team.

10:18.632 --> 10:19.820
"The crazy magic people"

10:20.357 --> 10:22.059
The casket is in Norway.

10:22.817 --> 10:25.771
- Come again?
- You should try more chaos theory,

10:25.801 --> 10:27.065
less failure.

10:28.155 --> 10:29.533
<i>Excuse me, gentleman.</i>

10:29.563 --> 10:31.954
<i>There appears to be
trouble inside the city.</i>

10:31.984 --> 10:33.174
What kind of trouble?

11:11.110 --> 11:13.105
It's clobbering time!

11:24.301 --> 11:25.301
Now!

11:55.738 --> 11:56.955
They're everywhere!

11:59.063 --> 12:01.724
Hawkeye, we need to find the
others. We need...

12:02.979 --> 12:04.868
Hey, big guy just a...

12:04.898 --> 12:07.119
You left Hulk in the pool!

12:07.149 --> 12:08.644
It froze!

12:09.219 --> 12:10.968
Oh, yeah...

12:10.998 --> 12:12.795
I forgot you were in there.

12:19.211 --> 12:22.087
<i>Iron Man to all Avengers.
We got a bead on what's causing this.</i>

12:22.117 --> 12:24.156
<i>Thor, Panther and I are
going to deal with it.</i>

12:24.872 --> 12:26.591
I'm just saying it's ironic.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.734
All the complaining about technology,

12:28.764 --> 12:30.638
and now an eternal Asgardian
super winter is threatening

12:30.668 --> 12:32.989
to destroy all life on earth.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.027
<i>You have irony, right? In Asgard?</i>

12:37.600 --> 12:40.290
External temperatures are dropping exponentially.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.129
- The engines are seizing.
- Indeed, we do have irony.

12:43.288 --> 12:45.356
Just as you are having some right now.

12:45.386 --> 12:46.665
I hate magic!

12:55.607 --> 12:59.976
All I am saying is if your jet
cannot handle a little cold weather...

13:00.006 --> 13:01.909
- It can handle it.
- Avengers.

13:07.682 --> 13:08.682
Amora!

13:09.043 --> 13:10.995
Greetings, Thunderer.

13:11.295 --> 13:13.376
Fancy meeting you here.

13:13.624 --> 13:14.624
Malekith!

13:14.903 --> 13:16.613
Ok, I'll bite... What's a Malekith?

13:16.643 --> 13:19.599
Malekith the accursed, the
master of the hounds.

13:19.629 --> 13:22.065
A dark Elf from the realm of Svartalfheim.

13:22.095 --> 13:23.984
Yeah, that didn't real clear it up.

13:24.167 --> 13:27.131
You and your people were destroyed
by the Frost Giants.

13:27.161 --> 13:28.564
How did you come here?

13:28.797 --> 13:31.791
I walk in both worlds now, Odin-son.

13:32.738 --> 13:34.115
The living...

13:34.145 --> 13:35.471
and the dead.

13:35.645 --> 13:38.568
Then I shall send you back
where you belong, Elf.

13:43.888 --> 13:44.888
Thor!

13:47.240 --> 13:48.898
What do you want, Malekith?

13:48.928 --> 13:51.462
Why have you released this
winter upon the Earth?

13:51.492 --> 13:54.916
I had heard that Thor had
turned his back on his father,

13:54.946 --> 13:58.601
choosing this mortal realm over Asgard.

13:58.631 --> 14:01.436
I too wish to make my home here.

14:01.743 --> 14:05.397
I will bring my people back
to the land of the living.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.061
In Midgard.

14:07.207 --> 14:09.682
In fact, it has already begun.

14:14.141 --> 14:18.126
The casket's power will
destroy you pathetic mortals.

14:18.156 --> 14:22.238
And I will cut off Midgard
from the nine realms.

14:22.471 --> 14:26.955
This land will become a new
paradise for the dark Elves.

14:30.253 --> 14:32.287
Ruled by me.

14:52.293 --> 14:53.792
But sadly,

14:53.822 --> 14:55.937
you will not be here to see it.

15:08.471 --> 15:11.121
Chilly, is that all you got?

15:11.753 --> 15:13.129
My hounds,

15:13.159 --> 15:14.512
tear them apart!

15:33.141 --> 15:34.491
Panther, watch out!

15:57.093 --> 15:58.308
Jan! Hulk!

16:01.270 --> 16:02.570
Hawkeye!

16:10.082 --> 16:11.082
Panther!

16:20.126 --> 16:22.124
Thor! Thor! Get up!

16:24.896 --> 16:27.331
Metal is bane to the dark Elves.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.561
Iron is his weakness.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.854
Vibranium, seems to work as well.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.244
You dare?

16:44.447 --> 16:47.371
A mortal thinks he can hurt
Malekith the accursed?

16:47.401 --> 16:48.751
A mere man?

16:49.488 --> 16:51.431
How about an iron man?

16:54.785 --> 16:58.794
Your armour,
has very little iron in it.

17:03.424 --> 17:05.924
You forget your place, dark Elf.

17:06.365 --> 17:09.247
Let me remind you with
whom you are dealing.

17:22.611 --> 17:25.236
Your hammer may wield magic.

17:25.266 --> 17:27.089
but I am magic.

17:27.256 --> 17:30.142
I am beyond life and death now.

17:30.300 --> 17:34.085
And with the power of the casket.
Nothing can stop me!

17:40.392 --> 17:41.773
Come on, Thor...

17:41.803 --> 17:42.853
Iron Man...

17:43.451 --> 17:44.751
Any time now...

17:48.857 --> 17:49.983
This isn't working.

17:50.013 --> 17:52.242
- How do we stop this guy?
- I...

17:52.272 --> 17:53.638
do not know.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.265
In, Wakanda

18:07.714 --> 18:11.074
Science and Mysticism work together,

18:11.104 --> 18:13.982
to accomplish things neither could do alone.

18:15.208 --> 18:16.538
Your lightning!

18:16.568 --> 18:19.734
It is no use,
he is too strong now.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.694
My armour,
it weakens him.

18:23.115 --> 18:24.330
We can do this!

18:24.360 --> 18:27.138
On my mark, hit me with
everything you got.

18:40.392 --> 18:42.110
For Midgard!

19:42.705 --> 19:44.919
What, what happened?

19:45.429 --> 19:48.357
I beat everybody and you
guys totally missed it.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.740
Welcome back, Sun!

19:53.640 --> 19:54.640
I...

19:54.989 --> 19:56.651
Thank you, Tony Stark.

19:57.352 --> 19:59.733
Would not have defeated
Malekith without you.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.142
Hey, no problem.

20:01.378 --> 20:03.874
My tech was nothing against him.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.929
- I needed...
- Together, we...

20:12.277 --> 20:13.903
Whoops, guess we forgot about her...

20:18.708 --> 20:19.708
Amora.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.169
What are you doing here?

20:21.632 --> 20:23.821
Tell me you are not
in league with, Malekith!

20:23.851 --> 20:25.879
It will all be over soon...

20:39.953 --> 20:42.765
- What are you doing?
- I am opening a portal to Asgard.
