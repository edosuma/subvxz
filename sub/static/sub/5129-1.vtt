 I want to have kids with you.

Okay... It is what you think. 
#But you pushed me into this.

-Yeah, why don't you go?  
  -He's not going anywhere.

04:56.977 --> 05:01.946
Okay, well, could he  
    at least put on a shirt? 
#This isn't about him!

05:01.948 --> 05:03.914
No, I know,  
     it's about us but...

05:03.916 --> 05:06.750
I would feel more comfortable  
 if he had a shirt on.

05:07.018 --> 05:09.118
Fine. Sure...

05:11.255 --> 05:15.156

#No, of course not,        that's much worse.

-Right. See what I mean?  
    -Just take it easy.

 him to process all of this  
 so suddenly.

Is it supposed to funny?

There's a lot more to it  
    than just being funny.

 a lot of unexplored talent.

#I still don't know       how I feel about it.

What did you tell him? 
#I don't know,   I'm still thinking about it.

I thought you never  
     wanted to get married. 
#I know.

You said it was the surest  
 way to ruin a relationship.

Well, not getting married  
 doesn't seem to work either.

 there's going to be someone  
 there when I'm old and gross.

     -Why? 
#I don't know.

Just feels like what  
     I should do right now. 
-Will?               -Yeah?

I love that passion, but no. 
#It doesn't?

14:12.886 --> 14:17.421
No, life sucks because  
     my ex left me for an  
    Off-Broadway monologist

14:17.423 --> 14:20.524
who just knocked her up  
 and asked her to marry him.

Now Gary is going to see my  
 daughters more than I do.

    to live in my old house, 
he's going to take over      my family

while I eke out a lonely  
    existence in a studio  
    apartment in Astoria.

14:34.638 --> 14:39.073
Have you been to Astoria? 
#I think like once,    for a party or something.

14:39.075 --> 14:43.743
-Yeah, once.  
     -What's a monologist? 
#It's like a comedian without   the jokes.

14:43.745 --> 14:44.910
-That's a thing?  
     -Yeah, that's a thing.

14:44.912 --> 14:48.079
According to the MacArthur  
  Foundation, it's a thing.

14:48.081 --> 14:51.982
He's probably monologuing  
  to my daughters right now. 
#JASON: I don't get it.

 with the graphic novel?

#To learn?

14:58.854 --> 15:03.489
You're on fire today, Paul.  
 To learn. To learn what? 
#How to tell a story.

15:03.491 --> 15:08.327
Why does anyone  
     need to tell a story  
     in the first place? 
#Because...

15:08.329 --> 15:12.597
You did it again.  
      Anyone else? 
#To understand        ourselves better.

15:12.599 --> 15:14.098
Okay, that sounds  
      nice, but, uh...

15:14.100 --> 15:17.801
If that's the only reason,  
  then why not just  
  go to therapy?

15:17.803 --> 15:21.670
Because therapy is stupid? 
#WILL: Yeah...

15:21.672 --> 15:24.339
Maybe it's stupid.

15:27.077 --> 15:28.209
Yeah, can I go home?

        -Yeah?

-Yeah, I'm fine.  
        -I'm just having  
          a bad life.

I don't want this to seem  
  weird or anything,

15:57.502 --> 16:00.936
but would you maybe like to  
 come to my place for dinner?

-Kat.  
        -Kat? Yeah, Kat.

Uh, that's a really  
     kind offer, Kat.

40:50.943 --> 40:55.211
No, you know, of course not. 
#Okay, girls, this is Kat.

40:55.213 --> 40:58.581
-What's up?  
     -That means "hello."

40:59.650 --> 41:02.350
C'mon, ya'll carryin'  
     your own cellos.

41:05.855 --> 41:07.788
All right.

41:07.890 --> 41:12.259
Memory pieces.  
      Who wants to share  
      theirs first?

41:15.430 --> 41:17.463
-Tom.  
             -Yeah.

41:25.172 --> 41:29.440
Hi. 
#I decided to write about   how I learned to masturbate.

41:29.508 --> 41:31.441
I was 12.

41:31.443 --> 41:34.577
So, one day, I walked into my  
 dad's office,

41:34.579 --> 41:36.745
where he kept  
    all the dirty magazines.

41:36.980 --> 41:41.382
And, uh, I found  
      some lotion and...

41:48.724 --> 41:50.590
You have a lot of nerve,  
    do you know that?

41:50.592 --> 41:53.526
Is this because I didn't call  
 you, because I thought  
 you were dating someone.

41:53.528 --> 41:56.095
-No! No!  
 -I thought... I wasn't sure  
 if the chemistry...

41:56.097 --> 42:00.898
What are you  
 even talking about? (SIGHS) 
This has nothing          to do with us!

42:00.900 --> 42:01.598
What's this to do with then?

42:01.600 --> 42:05.535
This is about the fact that  
 you asked my daughter  
 to skip your class

42:05.537 --> 42:07.336
so that she could  
     baby-sit your kids.

42:07.338 --> 42:09.571
I'm sorry, I was  
    in a desperate situation  
    this morning.

42:09.573 --> 42:12.941
But you didn't think to ask  
 any of your male students  
 for help?

42:12.943 --> 42:14.909
Are you kidding?  
 My male students are idiots.

42:14.911 --> 42:16.577
Oh! So, the idiots get to  
  go to class

42:16.579 --> 42:20.647
while the bright girl stays  
 at home and takes care  
 of your kids?

42:20.649 --> 42:22.949
What kind of message  
     does that send to Kat?

42:22.951 --> 42:24.417
Or to your daughters,  
     for that matter?

42:24.419 --> 42:28.988
-I'm sorry,  
     I just didn't think...  
     -Yeah, guys never do.

42:29.557 --> 42:33.625
Is she here? 
#She went out, after she      put your girls to bed.

42:33.627 --> 42:37.862
-They're asleep?  
    It's only seven o'clock.  
    -They were exhausted!

42:37.864 --> 42:40.297
What are you doing to them?

42:41.733 --> 42:44.500
I just wanted  
     more time with them.

42:46.670 --> 42:48.636
Come inside.

42:52.541 --> 42:53.973
Look, it's, it's none of my  
 business but...

42:53.975 --> 42:59.078
It just seems to me like you  
 and your ex are a little  
 loose about all of this.

42:59.080 --> 43:03.648
I mean they're children. 
#You can't just pass them   back and forth like puppies.

43:03.650 --> 43:05.683
Yeah, I know.

43:05.985 --> 43:09.720
-Why not? Why not?  
     -They need structure.

43:09.722 --> 43:12.923
-Stability.  
      -They get that  
      most of the time.

43:12.925 --> 43:17.060
Look, it's pretty simple.  
  In this kind of situation,  
  a child just wants to know

43:17.062 --> 43:21.163
where they're gonna  
     sleep at night. 
#You shouldn't change that    on a whim.

43:21.165 --> 43:24.666
-Yeah. Our kids  
        are so screwed.  
             -No.

43:24.668 --> 43:26.768
Believe me, I've made  
    just about every mistake  
    there is to make

43:26.770 --> 43:32.907
and if it's any consolation...  
 Kat made it through intact,  
 more or less.

43:33.175 --> 43:34.707
Oh, Kat's a great kid.

43:34.709 --> 43:39.244
Yeah, she is.  
    She really admires you.

43:39.346 --> 43:42.679
She does? Why? 
#She thinks you're        a great teacher.

43:42.681 --> 43:46.916
-Not counting today, maybe.  
 -(CHUCKLES) No, minus today.

43:47.184 --> 43:50.885
Wow, that's... 
#That's really nice to hear.

43:50.887 --> 43:56.023
I think she was a little  
    disappointed when  
    we didn't hit it off.

43:59.361 --> 44:00.893
Yeah.

44:03.030 --> 44:04.195
Uh, well, uh, we should  
    get going.

44:04.197 --> 44:08.432
What? You're not leaving!  
 Your girls are still sleeping.

44:08.434 --> 44:11.501
Yeah, we can't stay here. 
-Sure, you can.          -I don't know.

44:11.503 --> 44:15.171
I do. And I'm not letting you  
 drag them back to Astoria

44:15.173 --> 44:18.140
in the middle of the night! 
#What is that, a $40 cab ride?

44:18.142 --> 44:20.675
-I was going to take  
     the subway.  
     -(SIGHS)

44:20.677 --> 44:25.646
Come on.  
 I'm going to get you  
 some blankets for the couch.

44:28.884 --> 44:33.253
I can probably find you  
  some pajamas in here too.

44:33.521 --> 44:38.657
Oh, no, that's okay.  
     I can just sleep  
     in, uh, my clothes.

44:39.926 --> 44:41.425
(GRUNTS)

44:47.933 --> 44:51.234
I see you've been doing  
    some reading?

44:52.203 --> 44:57.138
Oh, yeah, I... 
#Felt bad after our...       Whatever it was.

44:57.140 --> 45:00.741
And I thought I should  
      at least see what  
    you were talking about.

45:00.743 --> 45:05.011
-So, what did you think?  
 -I think that you were right.

45:05.013 --> 45:08.614
Comic books are an  
    under-appreciated part  
    of American literature.

45:08.616 --> 45:12.050
-Really?  
     -Yeah, I had no idea 
what people were doing       in the form.

45:12.052 --> 45:16.554
I mean there's some  
 really complex,  
 emotionally-wrenching stuff

45:16.556 --> 45:17.688
-going on there.  
        -What?

45:17.690 --> 45:22.893
That's, that's amazing!  
    I, I'm so surprised  
    to hear you say that.

45:23.262 --> 45:28.164
(SIGHS) Actually, I...  
     I need to thank you. 
#What for?

45:28.166 --> 45:32.635
Well, I have a new  
  appreciation for what Kat  
  wants to do with her life.

45:32.637 --> 45:37.106
I can't believe  
  I was being so dismissive.

45:37.108 --> 45:40.476
I really am turning  
     into my mother.

45:40.478 --> 45:42.244
Wow. That's wonderful.

45:42.246 --> 45:47.349
Not that you were turning  
  into your mother, I mean  
      that you would...

45:47.351 --> 45:51.753
-You know what I mean.  
  -No, yeah, I do, I get it.

45:54.824 --> 45:55.255
Uh, so, uh...

45:55.257 --> 45:59.125
You still seeing that guy,  
  the one you weren't  
  sure if you liked?

45:59.127 --> 46:04.563
Oh, no, no, no, I...  
 Broke it off after our dinner.

46:05.098 --> 46:08.466
-Since dinner, yeah.  
     -Oh.

46:09.635 --> 46:14.270
So... 
-Oh, I have your blankets.    -Oh, thanks.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.905
Holding these. (CHUCKLES)

46:17.541 --> 46:24.279
Got you the soft ones  
    that I had so you can be  
    comfortable out there.

46:25.248 --> 46:28.148
These are really  
        nice blankets.

46:28.383 --> 46:30.349
It's no problem.

46:30.651 --> 46:34.786
Are you okay with me  
     standing this close?

46:34.954 --> 46:38.055
Yeah, I like it actually.

46:39.291 --> 46:44.994
-Is this okay here?  
    -This is, this is good,  
    I like it here.

46:54.271 --> 46:58.973
-We probably  
    shouldn't be doing this.  
    -No, we probably...

46:59.508 --> 47:03.542
-Okay, let's stop.  
      -Okay, let's stop. 
#No, let's not.

47:04.211 --> 47:07.078
-You want to stop, say it.  
  -Stop.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.480
-Gee, you smell so good.  
    -Yes...

47:09.482 --> 47:14.518
Okay, listen, we have  
  to be quiet. I don't want  
  to wake up the kids.

47:14.520 --> 47:17.420
(WHISPERING) Yeah, okay,  
  I'm going to be so quiet.

47:17.855 --> 47:19.788
Well, not too quiet,  
     I like to be affirmed.

47:19.790 --> 47:24.492
Okay, I'll be whispering  
    affirmations at you.

47:26.229 --> 47:30.330
Wait a minute. 
-I have to tell        you something.        -Something wrong?

47:30.332 --> 47:34.500
No, I just...  
     I want to just say...

47:34.802 --> 47:38.804
-No bullshit, okay?  
     -Oh, yeah... No.

47:39.973 --> 47:42.706
I mean I, uh... 
#I'm a big girl and...

47:42.708 --> 47:47.944
I don't need this to be  
    anything more than  
    what it is, but just...

47:47.946 --> 47:50.446
Don't bullshit me.

47:52.349 --> 47:57.151
Do you understand,  
  I've been through enough.

47:57.219 --> 47:59.519
Yeah, I understand.

47:59.521 --> 48:03.022
-I've been hurt, too.  
     -I know.

48:03.024 --> 48:05.290
I could tell  
      the minute we met.

48:05.292 --> 48:07.191
It's actually one of the first  
 things I liked about you.

48:07.193 --> 48:11.595
That's funny. Do you know  
  one of the first things  
  I liked about you was?

48:11.597 --> 48:12.862
-What?  
         -Your tits.

48:12.864 --> 48:17.066
That's so nice.  
      Please touch them.

48:19.537 --> 48:22.538
(DIANE LAUGHING)

48:26.710 --> 48:29.277
-CLIO: Daddy?  
         -Oh, no, no...

48:31.314 --> 48:35.348
-You have to go get her.  
    -Daddy, are you there? 
#No, no, no, no, no.

48:35.350 --> 48:39.352
-Okay, I'm going  
      to be right back.  
            -Okay.

48:39.354 --> 48:44.288
I'll be here. (SIGHS) 
Hey.

48:44.290 --> 48:48.992
Where were you? 
#I was, uh, just getting some   blankets from Kat's mom.

48:48.994 --> 48:52.762
She's invited us all to  
  have a sleep-over tonight.

48:52.864 --> 48:56.531
Isn't that fun? 
#Where are the blankets?

48:58.067 --> 49:02.069
Let's go, let's, um, get  
    you back to bed.

49:19.354 --> 49:23.889
-Where are you going?  
     -Just stretching.

50:06.667 --> 50:09.267
Well, this is wildly  
     inappropriate.

50:13.172 --> 50:16.873
Oh... Hey, Kat. 
#Hi, good morning.

50:16.875 --> 50:20.242
Where have you been all night? 
#What?       None of your business!

50:20.244 --> 50:23.511
Is your, uh, is your mom up? 
#Actually, no, she just       left for work,

50:23.513 --> 50:28.381
but she did tell me  
     to tell you good-bye. 
-Oh, yeah?            -Mmm-hmm.

50:28.383 --> 50:31.149
How did she say it? 
#"Tell him I said bye."

50:31.518 --> 50:33.317
Do you know where my  
     children are?

50:33.319 --> 50:37.454
Yeah, they're in the kitchen,  
 eating breakfast. 
#Okay, good. Good.

50:37.456 --> 50:41.424
Hey, I'm sorry  
        about yesterday. 
#Yeah, no, it's fine.

50:41.426 --> 50:45.728
Actually, I really  
    like your kids.  
    They are very, very fun.

50:45.730 --> 50:50.532
Yeah. Thank you. 
#Uh, I want to       make it up to you.       How does $20 sound?

50:50.534 --> 50:53.868
Sounds like you don't know  
 how much to pay a baby-sitter.

50:53.870 --> 50:56.737
How much,  
 uh, how much would you like?

50:58.474 --> 51:02.040
$350. 
-$350?               -Yeah!

51:02.042 --> 51:03.741
Could you give me a month?

51:03.743 --> 51:07.344
Um, you know, you...

51:08.447 --> 51:11.114
Do you think you can  
    just read this? Please?

51:11.116 --> 51:12.415
-If you have time?  
      -What is this?

51:12.417 --> 51:15.484
-It's like a story I've been  
 working on for like forever.  
            -Uh-huh.

51:15.486 --> 51:18.620
Um, I don't know actually,  
  it's pretty dumb,

51:18.622 --> 51:19.487
it's not like,  
     really finished, so...

51:19.489 --> 51:22.556
-No, I'll read it.  
 No, I'd love to read it.  
 -No that's fine, I'll take it.

51:22.558 --> 51:26.893
I'd love to read it. 
-You would?          -Sure, it would          be my pleasure.

51:26.895 --> 51:31.097
Thank you. 
#Um, now get out of my room.

51:31.099 --> 51:32.598
Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.

51:32.600 --> 51:36.702
And take the sheets  
 with you, please. Burn them.

51:37.237 --> 51:40.871
COLETTE: Dad, why did we sleep  
 at Kat's last night?

51:41.206 --> 51:44.540
Because, uh, you guys  
    fell asleep and I didn't  
    want to wake you.

51:44.542 --> 51:47.476
-Do you like her?  
  -Who, Kat? Of course I do.

51:47.478 --> 51:51.179
-I like all my students.  
    -Are you going  
    to marry her?

51:51.181 --> 51:53.981
No! She's only 19!

51:55.684 --> 51:58.317
(WHISPERING) I'm not  
     going to marry her.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.387
Okay, have a great day, girls.

52:03.056 --> 52:04.588
Hey, what's wrong?

52:05.724 --> 52:08.423
What did I do? 
#We don't want        you to marry Kat.

52:08.425 --> 52:10.191
I'm not going to marry Kat.

52:10.193 --> 52:13.727
-I miss Mommy!  
         -Oh, my God.

52:14.229 --> 52:15.995
Come here.

52:17.565 --> 52:19.331
It's okay.

52:33.613 --> 52:36.380
-Hi!  
         -Was it today?

52:36.849 --> 52:41.050
-No, I'm in a fitting.  
     -Oh. 
#What are you doing here?

52:41.052 --> 52:44.286
-Can we, can we talk?  
     -Yeah.

52:54.131 --> 52:57.966
-Are you going to sit?  
     -I can't sit in this.

52:58.435 --> 53:02.937
Okay, well...  
     You look really good.

53:03.105 --> 53:06.906
Oh... (CHUCKLES)  
      I don't know, I...

53:06.908 --> 53:09.041
I'm gonna be showing  
    so much by this wedding.

53:09.043 --> 53:10.742
I feel like I should  
     wear something that

53:10.744 --> 53:14.312
reveals more leg,  
      kind of distract  
        from the belly.

53:14.314 --> 53:18.582
-So, you wanted to talk to me  
 about something?  
 -Yeah, I...

53:18.584 --> 53:21.785
I just think that the kids  
  are very confused.

53:21.787 --> 53:23.286
Why? What have you been  
    doing to them?

53:23.288 --> 53:25.221
I haven't been doing  
     anything to them.

53:25.223 --> 53:28.557
They weren't confused  
    when I dropped them off  
    at your place.

53:28.559 --> 53:31.492
No, I'm not sure that's true. 
#What do you mean?

53:31.494 --> 53:34.528
I just think the girls  
     are struggling with  
     all of the changes

53:34.530 --> 53:35.695
that are going on  
      at the moment.

53:35.697 --> 53:40.232
-Which changes?  
     -Like, you know,

     you're seeing someone!

    I wouldn't say we're  
    seeing each other.

 believe you pick the one week  
 I give you the girls

to start seeing someone? 
#I thought you        wanted me to date.

How old is she?  
 I hope she's not a student.

54:02.685 --> 54:06.653
-She's not a student,  
  she's a student's mother.  
  -Wow.

54:06.655 --> 54:08.154
Where were the girls  
    when you were with her?

54:08.156 --> 54:12.925
They were sleeping  
     in her daughter's bed,  
     the student...

54:12.927 --> 54:16.460

#No wonder they're confused.

    Yeah, that sounds bad,  
    but it's not like that.

No, it's, it's fine.  
     I, I love that you're  
      seeing somebody.

-I think that's awesome.  
    -I'm not seeing...

        about me or you. 
#I just want the kids       to be happy.

54:29.941 --> 54:32.441
I thought happiness was not  
 a sustainable condition?

54:32.443 --> 54:34.042
You're absolutely correct,  
  it's not.

54:34.044 --> 54:35.777
But I don't think they  
     need to live in chaos.

  about the world I provide  
         for my girls.

     -Okay.

     Have you told them?

-Have you...  
  You haven't told them yet?  
  -Stop!

You drop them off  
     at my place on a whim.

 are pretty fucking chaotic! 
-Here!           -What is this?

55:14.011 --> 55:15.910
Their lives have never been  
 chaotic with me.

55:15.912 --> 55:18.879
It's my life that's been  
    chaotic because I was  
    unhappy for years

55:18.881 --> 55:19.813
and didn't do  
      anything about it.

 care of you, and then I was

01:20:02.912 --> 01:20:06.211
Yeah. 
#I know now.

01:20:20.193 --> 01:20:24.194
-You came.  
          -I came. 
#Your pants are too short.

01:20:24.196 --> 01:20:28.530
Yeah, I just got them. 
#You look good.

01:20:28.798 --> 01:20:30.898
There are people  
        looking for you.

01:20:32.434 --> 01:20:34.033
And only you know  
      where to find me.

01:20:34.035 --> 01:20:37.536
It kind of helped that you  
  texted me where you were.

01:20:40.274 --> 01:20:44.608
What are you doing? 
#I'm afraid   I'm making another mistake.

01:20:46.244 --> 01:20:51.179
I don't think of what we did  
 as a mistake. 
#It didn't work out.

01:20:51.481 --> 01:20:54.648
It did... 
#And then it didn't.

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:58.684
What does that mean? 
#It means... (SIGHS)

01:20:58.686 --> 01:21:01.319
We can't predict  
    what's going to happen.

01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:03.721
Or how we're going to change.

01:21:11.564 --> 01:21:13.497
I love you.

01:21:14.933 --> 01:21:16.499
I love you, too.

01:21:16.501 --> 01:21:20.269
But if you wait any longer,  
 you're going to miss your  
 wedding.

01:21:21.472 --> 01:21:25.139
Are we friends? 
#We're more than that.

01:21:25.241 --> 01:21:27.007
What are we?

01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:30.343
We're parents.

01:21:38.152 --> 01:21:40.185
